(Is there room for one more son?)
(One more son)
(If you can hold on)
(If you can hold on...)
(hold on)
(I wanna stand up,)
(I wanna let go)
(You know, you know,)
(no, you don't, you don't)

...is high on Capital Hill
as an emergency session of Congress
prepares to hear the President address the issue
of global violence.
Recent attacks have pushed this administration
to take extreme action
raising more fears than it's alleviated.
With global tension rising,
the President is taking a risky step
by confronting what some political observers...
Oh, I can't believe it.
Jake Green.
How you doing, man?
--When did you get back to town?
--Just now.
Is that Bonnie?
You grew up.
Wait a minute, where the hell you been?
You know, around.
--Jake, no one's been around for five years.
--The Army.
--I've been in the Army.
--Good for you.
--Who's that?
--She's from the IRS.
--IRS? Audit IRS?
--Yeah.
--Not going well?
--No. Forget it.
How about you and I, we go out
tonight and we catch up?
I'd love to, but I just came in
to see my grandfather, and
--I've got to get back, so...
--Okay.
Bonnie.
Bonnie, we need a pie.
One strawberry rhubarb.
Welcome back to Jericho, Jake.
His wife is lovely,
but I don't know about him.
Mrs. Olsen made me promise not to tell,
but she heard that he bought the old Thompson
place in cash.
Cash.
--That color looks really good on you.
--I know.
--Why didn't your mom take you to New York?
--'Cause she hates me.
What are you looking at, loser?
I could be shopping in SoHo right now
instead of Gracie's Market.
--I know. Look at this thing--
--so ugly.
--Promise not to tell?
--Promise, Mrs. Leigh.
What about you, Jake?
Where have you been keeping yourself?
I've been playing minor league baseball.
Oh, is that a fact?
Well...
when do you get in from Chicago?
All right.
Good. I'll pick you up.
I love you, too.
--Hey.
--Sorry, hi. Um...
What are you doing here?
I just came in for the day to visit my grandfather,
--see the family.
--Yeah, of course, sure.
--I just didn't hear.
--Anyway, how you been?
Mom tells me you're teaching at the high school now.
--Yeah, it's weird, huh?
--Yeah.
I love it.
I just bought a house in the Pines.
The East Side on a teacher's salary?
Uh, my-my fianc?
he's in banking, so...
--Oh, that helps.
--Yeah, Roger really loves it here.
Well, I'm happy for you, Emily.
--How about you, you got somebody?
--No.
--I'm sorry, I shouldn't...
--No, you're not, you love it.
--Where have you been?
--The Navy.
Oh, why do I even bother?
Seriously...
where have you been?
(And you ask me what I want this year)
(And I try to make this kind and clear)
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days )
('Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings)
(And desire and love and empty things)
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days)
(So take these words..)
Oh, Jake!
Oh, honey!
--Oh, you're home!
--You're choking me, Mom.
I thought I heard an annoying voice.
--Hey, brother.
--Good to see you.
('Cause tonight's the night the world begins again.)
I'm not here to interfere with your campaign, Dad.
All  I want is your signature,
then I'll visit Grandpa...
After five years, Jake,
that's all you have to say to Dad?
--It's none of your business, Eric.
--It is his business, it is all our business.
--What you put this family through...
--Johnston. For god's sake.
--Now, he could've been...
--We could spend a week talking about what
I could've been, all right?
I've  apologized.
I've made amends.
This is me now.
--I have a plan, but I need my money to make a clean start.
--It's not your money,
--it's your grandfather's money.
--I know, but he gave it to me for a reason.
And he gave me authority over it for a reason.
--You convince me you're leading a more
productive life and then...
--That's right, Jake.
We  were both born on third base.
Quit pretending you hit a triple.
--Now, when are you going to realize
I'm 32-years-old.
--When you do.
Can I talk to my mayor then, huh?
Let's go see your grandfather.
--I just...
--Stop it, Jake.
--The one thing I can't...
--You would have been here if you could.
I brought money.
--Here.
--I can't, Mom.
--I'll talk to your father.
--He doesn't get it.
--Because you won't tell him
why you really need the money.
--Mom.
You don't give him enough credit.
--Your dad's had a few trials of his own, you know?
--He can never know.
Just...
--Stay one more day.
--I got to get back to San Diego by tomorrow.
--Mom, one more thing.
--Hmm?
You have clumsy hands.
I love you.
Be careful now, okay?
Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.
Do I have to watch this?
(Old McDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O)
Yeah, well, we finally found
a garage where we can fix it.
We had to take a detour.
...ocean of hatred...
Feel like I'm back in D.C.
...in our great nation, and yet,
we all know that these divisions
pale in comparison
to the fundamental dangers
posed by the threat of terror.
We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world
a better place for our children and grandchildren.
This has always been our promise and this
will always...
Five, four, three, two, one.
We'll be back in an hour, Mr. McVey.
Mr. McVey? Hello?
...carried on...
We have...
No fun, Woody.
You have to hide better!
Woody?
What are you looking at?
Look! Look it!
Hurry on there right now.
Yeah, you better hurry up and get on home then.
Where's Cody?!
Has anyone seen Cody?
We haven't got time.
Shh.
Gail, what's going on?
Oh, Johnston.
Nothing.
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west,
maybe Denver.
Jimmy, get on the radio.
I want everybody at the sheriff's station.
--I'll pick up Eric. Let's move.
--All right.
Dad, don't leave.
Come here.
I'll be back real soon, all right?
Johnston.
Jake.
We'll find him.
We're bringing them out of the mine,
five at a time like always.
No need to start a panic.
--You're just trying to get another
hour's work out of my men!
--Stop it, the both of you.
Norman, get everybody out of the mine immediately.
And Shep, help him for a change.
--Sheriff? Chief?
--Yeah?
--Damage, fires, buildings?
--Nothing, Mr. Mayor.
--The town's fine.
--Well, let's hope you're right.
What does that mean?
Do we have any Geiger counters?
Excuse me?
Uh, excuse me.
Did something happen?
So, what does the emergency plan say?
Contact the governor, National Guard
and state troopers.
--Are we under attack?
--Son, I don't want to hear that word again.
Now look, this could have been a test.
It could have been an accident.
There's, uh, military bases near Denver.
One explosion does not make an attack.
If we stay calm,
the town stays calm, okay?
Oh.
--I found the Geiger counters.
--Thanks.
Oh, Grey, good to see you.
--We can use the extra help.
--Well, thank you, Johnston, Eric.
--Well, what can I do to help?
--We'll let you know.
Does it work, Dad?
Looks okay.
Mr. Mayor.
--Sheriff-- the bomb?
--Yes, ma'am, so far there's no sign
of any radiation.
--We'll keep checking around town.
--No. No, sir.
The school bus isn't back from
the field trip with my daughter.
--Well, do something!
--I got it.
--You-You should be out there looking for Stacy.
--Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, Teresa,
this is the first we've heard of it,
but we will deal with it, all right?
--Just please don't worry.
--That's easy for you to say.
You don't have a child out there.
So the school bus was here at the caves.
Now, who can tell me where they might have
gone for repairs?
--Well, there's Wilson's garage off 160.
--Or Cedar Run Road.
Principal Movey said they took a detour
before the phone cut out.
Well, I figure two teams.
There's only so many places they could be.
--Now, what about the parents?
--Right, right.
Folks. Folks! Folks.
Now,  look, I know that every part of you
wantsto just rush out there.
I don't blame you.
But as your friend, I'm asking you to
think about that.
You're safe here.
Now, what if, God forbid,
you go out there, and you get stranded,
and your child comes back an orphan?
You know the sheriff and his men.
You know they'll find your kids, so please.
Help!
Mister!
Mister, please!
Mister!
What? What is it?
Mister, help!
--Mister, please!
--I think they're...
I think they're dying!
That's fine.
Let's go find out.
Jimmy, get over there and calm those folks down.
Hey, Pete, come on!
We have our frequencies, sir,
but outside, it's like there's no one there.
All right, um...
what about analog?
We could contact the governor
with a Ham radio, couldn't we?
That could work, but there's only one in town
that I know of.
I was afraid you were going to say that.
Excuse me, Sheriff?
Robert Hawkins.
Well, it's good to meet you, Mr. Hawkins,
but as you can see, we've got our hands full.
Could you use an extra man?
No civilians, mayor's orders.
But I used to be a cop-- St. Louis.
--Do you know the roads around here?
--No, just moved to town.
Then I'm afraid you'd just slow us down,
I'm sorry.
You might want to get some black spray paint.
You know, cover that?
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident,
and I hope it was,
but if it was an attack, Sheriff,
and there's chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people knowing
that Jericho is still here.
With all due respect, Mr. Hawkins,
this is not St. Louis.
--Dad, are you okay?
--Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.
Oh, Oliver, would you stop that?
Sorry, Johnston.
Thought you were aliens.
Well, we're under attack by aliens, don't you know?
Yes, we do. That's why we're here.
--Do you have your Ham radio?
--Yeah.
--For you, 50 cents.
--Oliver.
--Well, I need my 50 cents.
--Okay.
Let me get you change.
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel
but we decided to stay in the city
an extra couple of days.
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that. It's my kid.
--Baby, what are you staring at out the window?
--Get over here and look at this!
What-What is that?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel,
but we decided to stay in the city
an extra couple of days.
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey...
...but we decided to stay in
the city an extra couple days.
Put down the phone and come to bed.
Hon... Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel
but we decided...
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel
but  we decided to stay in
the city an extra couple days.
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that. It's my kid. Baby...
--How could we lose power?
--I don't know.
Bomb could have fried the relays.
--That's possible.
--Maybe.
They could've blown up the power station for all we know.
Guys, it was probably just a drain on
the system from Denver.
You a science teacher?
--Robert Hawkins.
--Chief Carroll.
--Hey.
--Hey.
Jimmy, what's your 20?
Willow Creek, Sheriff.
There is nothing in sight.
The deer went crazy and started running
all over the road.
All right, just don't look at it.
Is he alive?
Yeah.
--Are you okay?
--Yeah.
I think my leg is broken.
--Can you feel your toes?
--Yeah.
Don't worry about me.
Worry about them.
Is anybody hurt?
Huh? Anybody?
Stacy's sick.
She can't breathe.
What's wrong?
What happened?
When the bus stopped,
she was like this.
It's okay, Stacy, let me see.
Let me see it?
Can I see?
Let me just see, Stacy.
It's okay. It's okay.
Do you have an ice pack?
We've got to stop the swelling now.
Lucas, the first aid kit is under the seat.
You're okay.
Come on, it's all right.
Just keep breathing.
Breathe normally, all right?
It's okay. It's okay, you're fine.
Just keep breathing normally.
Okay, you're okay.
You're okay.
Please.
Calm down, calm down.
Hey? Hey, Stacy?
No, no, no. No.
Think. Think.
Think.
All right.
Look, I need everyone's help right now.
Who has a pen?
Does anyone?
Does anybody have a pen?
All right, I need a pen.
--We have pencils.
--No, I need a tube.
Something hollow, um...
A straw.
--I have a straw.
--Here, let me see it.
Let me see it, come on.
That's too thin.
Does anyone else have a juice box?
--I do!
--All right, get them out, get them out.
Get some Band-Aids out.
--What's your name?
--Julie.
All right, everybody give your straws to Julie.
Okay? Hurry, quick.
Make them into a circle.
All right, you got that?
There you go, now tape them
together with those Band-Aids.
Come on, Stacy.
All right, who's the strongest kid?
You. I need you to hold her shoulders down,
in case she wakes up. All right?
Don't look.
Where's my straws?
Come on, come on.
Breathe for me, okay? Please?
Come on. Come on.
Wait,  I see something.
--Okay, okay, we see the bus.
--Uh, good.
--You want us?
--No, no, you keep looking for Jake.
Let's get down there, boys.
How'd you learn how to do that?
Uh, military school.
Were you a soldier?
No, a screw up.
Sheriff.
Sheriff, look at this.
It's the wrong bus!
Riley, Riley get over here!
Riley!
Oh, great.
Where's the damn rescue party?
Oh, hi, Dale.
Come on in, honey.
Come on, we're all trying
to get through this together.
Hi, Dale.
You okay, honey?
What you got there?
It's my mom.
Hi, Dale, sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel
but we decided to stay in the
city an extra couple days.
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that, it's my kid.
Baby, what are you staring at out the window?
Get over here and look at this!
What, what is that?
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, Dale, I am so sorry.
I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
She wasn't in Denver.
She was in Atlanta.
Oh, my God.
I'm sure that they'll have some answers.
Oh, my God.
How is she?
We have to get her back.
Right here. Right here.
Miss Lisinski, are we going to
have school tomorrow?
We'll figure it out, honey.
I vote no.
Dale, Dale, what are you doing, honey?
Please, please don't steal from me.
Dale!
--Ready?
--Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you got extra there?
First come, first serve.
You filled up your truck, you
going to mow your lawn, too?
--I've got a family, you know?
--We've all got families.
Come on.
Get your hand off the can.
Come on.
What do you think you're doing, hmm?
--What are you doing?
--What's your problem?
All right, everybody sit down.
Hurry.
Food won't go rotten as long
as the weather stays cool.
Hopefully the power will be fixed by then.
Thank you for this, Dale.
Anything for you, ma'am.
--Step away from the car.
--Get out of the car.
--Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on,
--break it up.
Get off.
You need to get some lights on
before people start losing it.
All we have is lanterns and flashlights.
That's not enough to light up
the street though.
But your town does roadwork at night, right?
Excuse me.
--The machine doesn't work.
--Well, you guys have to pay cash or something!
You sure you're not the science teacher?
Chief, we got a little problem
down here at the gas station.
We need your help right away.
--I'm on my way.
--I got this.
--I'll come with you.
--All right, thanks.
Sir.
Something's going on at the gas station.
Big crowd.
Looks like trouble.
Gonna need help down here.
--Dad.
--I heard.
Go, go.
--Sara?
--It's okay.
Honey?
I don't have time right now.
--Some damn fool...
--Johnston.
--What?
--Listen to me.
Dale Turner's mother died
tonight in another explosion.
Atlanta.
Oh, my God.
Sheriff?
Yeah, there's no sign of Jake out here
in fact, there's, uh, no sign of anybody.
We're going to,
we're going to head back.
Let me know if the kids need anything
Sheriff, you there?
Stay awake.
Stay awake, don't--
Does this bus have a gas can?
If the bus...
If it stops...
Okay.
Kids, listen to me.
If the bus stops again,
we're going to need you to walk back to town
and get help, okay?
I don't know where we are.
When we get to the stop sign,
turn left, all right?
Take a left.
Which way is left?
Hold up your hands...
stick out your thumbs.
The one that makes the L,
that's your left.
Get your hands off me!
Do something, will you?
County Edwards! Carl! Carl!
Stop it right now!
Yeah, Morty, I'm talking to you!
Michael Stevenson.
Carl Meeks... Carl!
Why are you turning on each other?
Stealing from your neighbors?
You are fighting the wrong people!
We are literally in the dark.
All I'm saying is that I-I think
we need to get organized.
I...
I don't know where the mayor is,
but maybe it's time we came up
with a plan ourselves.
What's going on, Gray?
We making speeches?
With all due respect, Mr. Mayor
we have a missing bus,
no police,
firemen doing policemen's job.
--How dare you politicize it!
--Eric. Eric.
I'm not talking to my opponent
I'm talking to my mayor.
Now, I don't care about the election
I care about survival.
We just might be on our own here,
and I need to know what my mayor intends to do!
Folks, I know we've been through a lot tonight.
I want to tell you something.
I've been to big cities and
I've been to foreign countries,
--but I will take the good people of--
--The good people of Jericho
over any other city
we know, Mr. Mayor, we've heard the speech.
Well, Shep, I hope you don't think
I've been asleep at the switch.
We had all hoped this was an accident
but the unfortunate truth is
there was another explosion in Atlanta.
--What?
--Oh, my God.
--I been busy trying to contact the governor.
--Yeah? Well, what if the governor's dead?
There is no report of anything happening in Topeka.
--How are we going to get reports
without television?
--Or no phones?
What about New York?
--We don't know anything about New York.
--When are we going to get the power back on?
--Is the drinking water okay?
--One at a time, please.
--Calm down.
--Calm down? My boy is still out there.
The sheriff is out there right now
looking for your boy and my boy.
What if we had more police officers out there?
--We need to know what you're going to do now.
--No one can answer that.
Help them! Help them!
It's Stacy.
Hey, there, little one.
--You're okay.
--I got you.
What's your name?
--Heather.
--Jake.
--Nice to meet you, Jake.
--You, too.
Mommy!
--I missed you so much.
--I love you.
Hey, Buddy.
Dad, there was this deer...
Mommy's right here.
I'm right here, honey.
Everything's going to be okay.
--Jake.
--Mom.
--Oh, your face.
--I'll be all right.
--Oh, honey.
--You okay?
Of course.
Eric, help your brother.
--Put your arm around me.
--Careful. Careful.
Easy. Easy.
Okay.
--Eric, get April.
We'll meet you the medical center.
--Okay.
Hey, hey, there's an empty
prison bus out there.
--Whereabouts?
--Cedar Run.
All right, just relax.
I'll take care of it.
--God! Look at you. You're a mess.
--It's fine.
--Stop worrying about me.
--Well, good luck with that.
Hey, Shep?
You said earlier that you had
heard that speech before.
Ever ask yourself why I say it?
'Cause I happen to trust you people.
'Cause I love my town.
Now, something happened in Denver, in Atlanta,
and it could be that we wake up
and we find out that's where it stopped.
But, until we know,
are we going to use our imaginations
to solve problems
or to cause them?
We can find out how big this thing is.
If we have to, we can fight.
We can fight anybody.
We can fight all enemies.
The only way that's going to happen
is if we work together.
Now, go on home.
We'll meet tomorrow at the town hall.
And, folks,
don't you break my heart again.
Chief, keep all the men at their posts
until the sheriff gets back.
Hey, Shep.
I was afraid I was never going
to see you again.
Come on. You think I'd
let Dad have the last word?
Hey.
Quit talking about me.
You did a great thing out there tonight.
Thanks.
Your grandfather would have been proud.
I'm going to go see what's
taking these guys so long.
You know, I go away for a few years
and the town goes to hell.
I'm glad you're home.
Yeah, we'll see.
What are you thinking?
I was just wondering what it was all going
to look like in the morning.
(I'll sing it one last time for you)
(Then we really have to go)
(You've been the only thing that's right)
(In all I've done...)
What's happening?
(Light up, light up)
(As if you have a choice)
(even if you cannot hear... )

Previously on jericho...
Jake green !
How you doing,man ?
Wait a minute. Where the hell you been ?
Around.
Jake,no one's been around for five years.
Seriously,where have you been ?
Hey,brother.
What you put this family through...
johnston,for god's sake.
Now,he could have been...
we could spend a week talking about
what I could have been,all right ?
I've apologized,but I need my
money to make a clean start.
It's not your money. It's your
grandfather's money.
Stay one more day.
Jake: I've got to get back to
san diego by tomorrow.
All right,it looks like the explosion
came from the west,maybe denver.
Did something happen ?
Are we under attack ?
Hi,dale. Sorry I didn't call
sooner,angel,but we...
oh,my god !
Oh,my god !
sheriff ?
Robert hawkins.
I am so sorry.
I didn't know your mother was in denver.
She wasn't in denver.
She was in atlanta.
Oh,my god !
Look,I know you're telling people it was
an accident,but if it was an attack,sheriff,
and there's chaos out there,you might not want
the wrong people knowing that jericho is still here.
It's the wrong bus !
Riley !
get april. We'll meet you at the medical center.
There's an empty prison bus out there.
What's your name ?
Heather.
Nice to meet you,jake.
It's a great thing you did out there tonight.
Thanks.
Something happened in denver,atlanta,and it could be
that we wake up and we find out that's where it stopped.
But,until we know,are we going to use our
imaginations to solve problems,or to cause them ?
is there any sign of the sheriff,mr. Hawkins ?
No,sir.
I need to speak to your mayor.
We got trouble coming.
Oh,my god.
Mom,where's april ?
Jake,where have you been ?
Where is she ?
She's down the hall.
What's going on ?
Get dad on the radio.
You'll be fairly mobile on it.
How do you feel ?
I feel like a badass.
April,does the clinic have a fallout shelter ?
Yes. What's going on ?
It's bad. Come on.
Jericho has two underground shelters,one right here
under the town hall,the other under the medical clinic.
What about basements and storm cellars ?
They're better than nothing,but you've got
to seal off the rest of the house with,uh...
duct tape,plastic sheeting,anything
you can get your hands on.
How do you know about radiation,mr. Hawkins ?
Because I was a cop in saint louis and,
after 9-11,we got up to speed.
So our biggest problem could be the rain.
Won't the rain clear the radiation
out of the air ?
Yes,and bring it straight down on jericho...
a direct,concentrated hit.
Anyone exposed too long...
mr. Mayor ?
Sir ?
All right,look. We're gonna
divide the town in two.
Everyone over here can go to the town hall shelter,
all those on the north side will go to the clinic.
We'll get the word out,dad.
How long before the radiation gets here ?
Oh,I'm new here.
This is your town.
How long does it normally take
a storm to get here from denver ?
Less than two hours.
Sounds right.
Two hours ?
We can't do that in two hours.
Not enough time.
We've got work to do,guys.

city hall
Jake and I used to play down
here when we were kids.
I don't think anyone's been
down here in ten years.
How many people can we fit in here ?
300.
You do know that there's almost
5,000 people in this town.
Eric ?
Make sure all the people that
have basements use them.
We are not running out of room here today.
You understand ?  Got it,dad.
Jimmy !
jericho medical
fallout shelter
When was the last time someone was in here ?
You're kidding me.
I can't put people in here.
There's no air.
There's no air in here.
I hope the fan works.
We got a lot of work to do.
Wait,wait !
Oh,thank god.
I haven't seen anybody for hours.
I ran out of gas.
There's dead birds all over the road.
Yeah,we saw them,too.
They must have flown through the radiation.
What radiation ?
There was a mushroom cloud. Somebody nuked us.
Oh,my god.
Look,miss,we're running low on gas.
Do you know if there's a gas station nearby ?
Well,what do you think it is ?
Do you think it's an accident or...
Ma'am,we don't know yet.
Okay.
Did it come from wichita,because
my fiance,he's flying in from...
no,no. Wrong direction.
It looked more like denver.
Look,we need gas.
Do you know if there is a gas station nearby ?
yeah.
No.
No,the pumps are...
they don't work.
They've all been abandoned.
No,we could...we could try the richmond ranch.
I think they might have gas there.
Then get in. We'll take you there.
Miss ?
It's okay.
Get in.
Dale ?
Wake up.
Wake up,angel.
Mom ?
Don't you remember what happened last night ?
Your mom's gone.
gracie ?
Come on,gracie ! Open up !
Gracie,we need to stock the shelters with food !
Attention !
Attention !
There is radioactive fallout coming
from the nuclear blast.
You have less than 90 minutes to get indoors.
I repeat,you have less than
90 minutes to get indoors.
Use your basements.
Use duct tape or other tape to seal your home.
You have less than 90 minutes.
You can go to the shelter at town hall
or the shelter at the medical center.
There is radioactive fallout coming.
You have 90 minutes to get yourselves indoors.
We are indoors !
you're not from around here,are you ?
I came from D. C.  To supervise
a little audit on a farm.
Is god punishing me ?
Look,you really should get to
the basement at town hall.
You think ?
Jake,I'm not going anywhere.
Mom...
mom,I'm not going to argue with you.
Go to the other shelter.
I'm staying.
Mom,I don't even know if we can fix it,
and I can't concentrate knowing you're here.
Please,I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
Promise me you'll come to the
shelter after it's fixed.
Promise me.
I promise,mom.
I want my boys with me.
Okay,go.
Please.
Frank !
Quit messing with the tv.
I don't want to waste my generator on static.
Mary,what are these people still doing here ?
They won't go.
I can't leave these clowns in my bar.
All right,listen up.
Radiation's on its way from denver.
If you don't have a basement,
you need to get to town hall.
There's a shelter therE.
I'm not going to town hall.
Well,you don't have a choice,people.
You're being evacuated.
And who are you ?
I'm the deputy mayor.
What,did your daddy make you a deputy ?
Just forget it,eric,you've told everybody.
Do you realize a nuclear bomb went off yesterday ?
So ?
If I'm going to die in a nuclear blast,so be it.
I'm going to be right here,
playing pool with my buddies.
But you're not going to die in a blast.
You're going to get radiation poisoning.
Within the first couple of hours you're going
to be vomiting and have crippling diarrhea.
Your hair is going to fall out in chunks.
Your skin,it's going to blister.
Your internal organs are going to start to shut down.
Because,well,frankly...
they're being cooked from the inside.
You're going to get sicker and
sicker until you can't move.
And then you will die.
Over there on the floor by the pool table...
with your buddies.
Don't mind me.
sit tight.
We'll be right back.
Sheriff,come in. Come in,sheriff,over.
Randall,no one's heard from
the sheriff since last night.
There was a prison bus out there.
I think we better assume the worst.
You're on your own.
What about jimmy or bill ?
Deputies are missing,too.
You're just going to have to handle this yourself.
Don't think we forgot you,did you ?
Anything wrong,miss ?
No,nothing.
Doesn't look like anybody's here.
Yeah,well,the pump's locked,so...
you know,there is this other place
that I can take you to.
Look,we're running on fumes as it is.
Make a sound,you die.
I'm sorry,sir,I don't think anybody's home.
Ms. Sullivan...
what a surprise.
Hey,bonnie.
Oxygen tanks,ivs,all non-electrical medical supplies.
When was that written ?
1957.
The population of jericho was 1,000 people.
I'll start moving everyone.
I'll get the ventilation system fixed.
god,they chewed through everything.
Mind if I pitch in ?
You know how to strip wires ?
Ever since junior high.
Yeah,I was that popular.
All right,great.
Check the fan belt,I think it's frayed.
Well,then you might want to get another one.
Any mid-century american car would be a good match.
And check the brushers.
We don't want the motor to seize up.
Okay.
All right.
You take over.
I'll look for a fan belt.
Excuse me,sir.
You're doing that wrong.
April.
She thinks we shouldn't move the baby.
Ma'am,your baby's protected in this little bubble.
She's got fresh air and food.
Right now,she's the safest person in jericho,but you're not.
We need to make sure she has a mother to take care of her when this thing is over,okay ?
Please.
Please,let us take you both down
to the shelter,okay ?
Okay.
Bobby.
Jake green ?
Just a second,ma'am.
Bobby,there's two in the nursery.
-I'm emily sullivan's aunt.
Taken to the shelter in our basement.
Mrs. Dawson,hi.
Have you seen emily ?
No,not since yesterday.
Maybe she's at the other shelter.
No one over there has seen her,
and she's not at her house.
I heard you were back in town,and I figured
the one person who would know...
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
If i see her,I'll tell her you're
looking for her,but I'm sure she's fine.
o we'll just,uh,use your pump
and be on our way.
Stanley has the key.
What did she just say ?
her brother,stanley,he's got the key to the pump.
Wait a minute,she's deaf ?
Yes.
I read lips.
When do you think stanley gets back ?
Another hour.
What did she just say ?
It's going to be about an hour.
Oh,we can wait an hour,can't we ?
Ms. Sullivan,you all right ?
Yeah,fine.
I'm just hungry.
why don't we make some food for the officers ?
Oh,I want eggs.
It's a farmhouse,you've got eggs,right ?
Yeah,why don't we,uh...
why don't we all go make something to eat ?
Sure.
People south of main go to you at town hall ?
Yeah,that's right,all those to the north
of main street go to the medical center.
Johnston.
Right,yeah,I know,you want me to take it easy.
I'm just going to go help eric
get the supplies from gracie.
I've already sent people to do that.
Gail,who is in charge here,you or me ?
You do not want to play that game.
Here's every book we have in the
library about nuclear radiation.
Our friend the atom.
Some friend.
Anything in here for grownups ?
I'd like to know what we're supposed
to do if this town gets hit.
None of the books are specific.
Atom bombs have only gone off in
populated cities twice in history.
And denver was probably hit
by a hydrogen bomb,anyway.
What's the difference ?
Hydrogen bombs,they literally explode the air.
So,what you're saying is that
nobody knows what's really coming ?
Then we pick worst case scenario.
What needs to be done ?
One second,sir,I have that.
Let me just...
anything left outside will have to be scrubbed down.
And if it rains,the top 18 inches or so of soil
will have to be removed before planting again.
And tell everybody to cover all the water wells.
That's about what it says,right ?
Yes.
Yes,that's right.
Well,you heard the man.
Jeff,let's make sure all the
ranchers get the livestock inside.
I'm going to work on the radio.
This may be our last chance
to make contact for a while.
There's a bunch of people in the church.
They held a vigil there all night.
I'm going to make sure they get into shelter.
Hurry back.
Yes,ma'am.
I'm telling you they need to be replaced.
Listen,girlie...
please,don't argue with me. -Don't tell me...
the brushers are shot,it's revving too high.
turn them off !
Jake,everyone's ready.
What do we do now ?
Don't let them in here !
The rain's going to be here soon.
People are getting scared.
Do we have air or not ?
You seal them up in here,they're going to die.
Dad,can you hear me ?
Dad's checking on the church.
Jake,what do you need ?
Our shelter's no good.
I'm bringing these people to town hall.
Whoa,whoa,hold on.
Jake,I don't know how many more people we can hold.
What about the basement ?
They don't have basements,eric.
That's why they came here.
Eric,we've got 200 people here.
Some of them need medical attention.
Handle it.
Look,I will be at town hall soon.
I'll check to see how much room we have.
And I will call you back.
I don't have time; we're coming.
Sorry,my husband needs a kick sometimes.
You don't have to apologize to me.
I've got to go to the shelter.
Bring everything you can.
H-how much more do you need ?
Enough to feed half the town,gracie.
Half the town ?
Wait--
skylar,you have to come to the shelter.
I'm not going to some stupid shelter.
I'm going home to wait for my parents.
Don't be crazy.
I'm not crazy ! I'm going home.
Fine. -Excuse me,ladies.
Are you going to pay for those ?
What are you talking about ?
Everybody is just taking stuff.
This is still my store.
Is that for an emergency ?
All right,you know what ?
Fine,keep it.
Her parents are in new york,okay ?
Who knows if they're even going to come back.
It was just a couple cans of soda.
They're my soda.
I say we head east.
She was headed east,wasn't she ?
Hey,how far from here would you say those crows were ?
About five miles west from where you picked me up.
Hell,then we'll go north.
You want to help me out with the coffee ?
Yeah,I'll show you where it is.
You better get down to that shelter.
The wind is moving faster than we thought.
I'm watching it.
Just get everybody underground.
You know,if you get that thing to work,just do me
a favor,and find out who did this to us.
eric,come in.
This is eric,go ahead.
A couple of busloads coming to town hall.
People,please !
Don't get off the bus.
We can't take any more.
Eric,what the hell are you doing ?
They can't come in here,jake.
What do you mean they can't come in here ?
We're packed ! -What ?
I got a whole bus full of people here that need shelter.
You're really gonna turn away all these people,eric ?
You're going to turn away your wife ?
We let everybody in,we'll all suffocate.
Eric,there are really sick people here,and the storm is coming !
Okay,we can take ten.
And I saved a spot for you.
All right,the ten most critical,fast.
Gray,the salt mine,how many people will it hold ?
As many as you want,but I don't think...
it has a ventilation system,right ?
Yeah,and water.
All right,it's the best option we have right now,all right ?
Mom ?
Have you seen your father ?
He told me he was going to the church.
Well,gail,people from that church got back 20 minutes ago.
Eric ?
Mom,we'll find dad.
Jake,take your people to the mine.
Leave us 10.
I'll go with you,jake.
After 27 years,nobody knows that mine the way I do.
I guess you can fit 11 people now.
Yeah,make it 12.
It's my place...I should be there.
Yeah,let's go.
We're going to be okay.
Hang on.
That smells good.
Oh,no,no,I'll get it.
I am so sorry.
Damn it.
Oh,that looks bad.
Look,go in the kitchen right now and run cold water over it.
It'll stop it before the blisters.
I'll clean up this mess.
what happened ? -She...
I burnt my hand.
You left her alone ?
She's fine.
Is he okay ?
He'll live.
I can only get 12 down on the elevator at a time !
That's the best I can do !
Shep,we have to seal the entrance.
There's no door,jake.
Well,we can't just let the rain pour down the shaft.
These people won't be safe.
We won't be safe.
Well,how do we seal it ?
I don't know,but it's a mine.
You got dynamite,right ?
we put charges here,here,here...
gray: Are you crazy ?
How do we know we won't bring the whole thing down on top of us ?
We don'T.
I am going to the little girls' room.
Hey,where is that ?
Right up the stairs.
Right there,see ?
Good to know.
Straight back !
Eric,any sign of dad ?
No,not yet.
Checked the church,main street.
We're going through every inch of town hall right now.
Listen,eric,I'm going to need you to bring a
crew over here and dig us out when this thing's over.
What ? What ?  Why ?
We're ready,jake !
Are you crazy ?
Just dig us out...and find dad,okay ?
Let's go.
mr. Hawkins,did my father come through here ?
No,I haven't seen him.
Mom,check the offices again.
Maybe we missed something.
I'll go check out the parking lot.
Look,we'll find him,okay ?
Okay.
Be careful.
We'll find him.
Could you use some help,ma'am ?
No,we need you on the radio.
You know,I can't get this old thing to work.
Okay,come. -Fine.
Please.
you are not in my house.
Get off my property,right now.
And my property goes all the way down the hill.
You need to get back to town.
The radiation's coming from denver.
I'm not leaving here.
My parents are on their way back.
You talked to them ?
No,freak,the phones are dead.
But I'm not leaving here without them.
All right,stay inside,tape up the windows,and don't use the water.
Don't tell me what to do.
I'm serious,skylar.
Stay inside.
Dale ?
Dale,stop !
Please.
Stay here.
It's not safe out there.
Please stay here.
Jody,where you at ?
All right,everybody...
hey,whoa,whoa,whoa.
Take some of that out,all right ?
Seal the entrance,not cause a cave-in.
Where'd you learn how to do that ?
I knew a guy once.
Did you blow him up ?
hello ?
Is anyone here ?
How does that look ?
It's good,that'll do.
How we coming,gray ?
This is the last of 'em.
I'm almost done here.
Same here.
This is emily sullivan.
We're at the richmond ranch with bonnie.
Please,help us.
Can you hear me ? Is there anybody there ?
What was that ?
Did you hear that ?
Somebody's on the radio. -This is emily sullivan.
I'm at the richmond ranch.
Everybody be quiet !
There are men here with guns.
I think they might have killed the sheriff.
Hello ?
Can you hear me ?
Emily !
Emily !
Emily,can you hear me ?
Emily.
Come in,come in.
Come in,can you hear me ?
Is there anyone out there ?
Is there anyone on this channel ?
Can anyone here me ?
Shep,give me your keys.
Jake,it's gonna start raining any minute now.
Give me your keys,I can make it.
All right.
Jake,you're out of your mind.
Gray,get everybody down there,all right ?
Hey,jake ?
What ?
When everybody's down,say "all clear.
" "All clear," okay ?
Almost ready,jake,stand by.
Come on,come on.
Jake ?
We're all clear.
johnston ?
Johnston ?
oh,my god.
Mr. Hawkins !
Mr. Hawkins !
Mr. Hawkins !
Where's the brother ?
Where the hell's the girl ?
I think they might have killed...
I think they might have killed the sheriffs.
Please,help us.
Hello. This is emily sullivan.
I'm looking for the jericho police department.
Can you hear me ? Is there anyone out there ?
Is there anybody on this channel ?
There are men here with guns.
I think they might have killed the sheriff.
Please,somebody help us.

Stop !

Think this through ! -Let her go !
No.
We just want gas.
Supplies,that's all this is about.
It's just about fuel.
Let her go.
Look.
Please,please,let her go.
No.
Is this what you want to see ?
Are you ready to talk now,miss ?
Please,let her go.
April...
april,come here.
Hey,dad,can you tell me what happened ?
Sit down.
Here,sit him down.
I just found him on the floor in his office.
Did you hit your head ?
All right.
bonnie,take him to the storm cellar now !
Go,guys,go !
Emily,we've got to get inside.

YDY proudly presents
Previously on Jericho...
Jake Green!
How you doing, man?
Wait a minute.
--Where the hell you been?
--Around.
Jake, no one's been around for five years.
Seriously, where have you been?
Hey, brother.
What you put this family through...
--Johnston, for God's sake.
--Now, he could have been...
We could spend a week talking
about what I could have been, all right?
--I've apologized, but I need my
money to make a clean start.
--It's not your money.
It's your grandfather's money.
--Stay one more day.
--I've got to get back to San Diego by tomorrow.
All right, it looks like the explosion came
from the west, maybe Denver.
Did something happen?
Are we under attack?
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call
sooner, angel, but we...
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Sheriff? Robert Hawkins.
I am so sorry.
--I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
--She wasn't in Denver.
She was in Atlanta.
Oh, my God!
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident
but if it was an attack, Sheriff
and there's chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people knowing
that Jericho is still here.
It's the wrong bus!
Riley!
Get April.
We'll meet you at the medical center.
There's an empty prison bus out there.
--What's your name?
--Heather.
Nice to meet you, Jake.
--It's a great thing you did t there tonight.
--Thanks.
Something happened in Denver, Atlanta,
and it could be that we wake up
and we find out that's where it stopped.
But, until we know,
are we going to use our imaginations
to solve problems
or to cause them?
--Is there any sign of the sheriff, Mr. Hawkins?
--No, sir.
I need to speak to your mayor.
We got trouble coming.
Oh, my God.
Mom, where's April?
--Jake, where have you been?
--Where is she?
She's down the hall.
--What's going on?
--Get Dad on the radio.
You'll be fairly mobile on it.
How do you feel?
I feel like a badass.
--April, does the clinic have a fallout shelter?
--Yes. What's going on?
It's bad. Come on.
Jericho has two underground shelters,
one right here under the Town Hall
the other under the medical clinic
What about basements and storm cellars?
They're better than nothing
but you've got to seal off
the rest of the house
with, uh... duct tape, plastic sheeting,
anything you can get your hands on.
How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?
Because I was a cop in Saint Louis
and, after 9-11, we got up to speed.
So our biggest problem could be the rain.
Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?
Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho--
a direct, concentrated hit.
Anyone exposed too long...
Mr. Mayor? Sir?
All right, look.
We're gonna divide the town in two.
Everyone over here can go
to the Town Hall shelter
all those on the north side will
go to the clinic
We'll get the word out, Dad.
--How long before the radiation gets here?
--Oh, I'm new here.
This is your town.
How long does it normally take
a storm to get here from Denver?
--Less than two hours.
--Sounds right.
Two hours?
--We can't do that in two hours.
--Not enough time.
We've got work to do, guys.
Jake and I used to play down
here when we were kids.
I don't think anyone's
been down here in ten years.
--How many people can we fit in here?
--300.
You do know that there's almost
5,000 people in this town.
- -Eric?
--Yeah?
Make sure all the people
that have basements use them.
--We are not running out of room
here today. You understand?
--Got it, Dad.
Jimmy!
When was the last time someone was in here?
You're kidding me.
I can't put people in here.
There's no air.
There's no air in here.
I hope the fan works.
We got a lot of work to do.
Wait, wait! Hey, hey!
Oh, thank God. I haven't seen anybody for hours.
I ran out of gas.
--There's dead birds all over the road.
--Yeah, we saw them, too.
They must have flown through the radiation.
What radiation?
There was a mushroom cloud.
Somebody nuked us.
Oh, my God.
Look,  Miss, we're running low on gas.
Do you know if there's
a gas station nearby?
Well, what do you think it is?
--Do you think it's an accident or...?
--Ma'am, we don't know yet.
Okay.
Did it come from Wichita,
--because my fiance, he's flying in from...
--No, no. Wrong direction.
It looked more like Denver.
Look, we need gas.
--Do you know if there is a gas station nearby?
--Uh... yeah. No.
No, the pumps are...
They don't work.
They've all been abandoned.
No,  we could... We could try
the Richmond Ranch.
--I think they might have gas there.
--Then get in.
We'll take you there.
Miss?
It's okay. Get in.
Dale?
Wake up.
Wake up, angel.
Mom?
Don't you remember what happened last night?
Your mom's gone.
Gracie? Come on, Gracie!
Open up!
Gracie, we need to stock the shelters with food!
Attention! Attention!
There is radioactive fallout
coming from the nuclear blast.
You have less than 90 minutes to get indoors
I repeat, you have less than 90 minutes to get indoors.
Use your basements.
Use duct tape or other tape to seal your home.
You have less than 90 minutes.
You can go to the shelter at Town Hall
or the shelter at the medical center.
There is radioactive fallout coming.
You have 90 minutes to get yourselves indoors.
We are indoors!
You're not from around here, are you?
I came from D.C. to supervise
a little audit on a farm.
Is God punishing me?
Look, you really should get
to the basement at Town Hall.
You think?
--Jake, I'm not going anywhere.
--Mom...
Mom, I'm not going to argue with you.
--Go to the other shelter.
--I'm staying.
Mom, I don't even know if we can fix it
and I can't concentrate knowing you're here.
Please, I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
Promise me you'll come to the shelter
after it's fixed.
Promise me.
I promise, Mom.
I want my boys with me.
Okay, go.
Please.
Frank! Quit messing with the TV.
I don't want to waste my generator on static.
--Mary, what are these people still doing here?
--They won't go.
I can't leave these clowns in my bar.
All right, listen up.
Radiation's on its way from Denver.
If you don't have a basement,
you need to get to Town Hall.
There's a shelter there.
I'm not going to Town Hall.
Well, you don't have a choice, people.
You're being evacuated.
And who are you?
I'm the deputy mayor.
What, did your daddy make you a deputy?
Just forget it, Eric,
you've told everybody.
--Do you realize a nuclear bomb went off yesterday?
--So?
If I'm going to die in a nuclear blast, so be it.
I'm going to be right here
playing pool with my buddies.
But you're not going to die in a blast.
You're going to get radiation poisoning.
Within the first couple of hours
you're going to be vomiting
and have crippling diarrhea.
Your hair is going to fall out in chunks.
Your skin,
it's going to blister.
Your internal organs are going to start to shut down.
Because, well, frankly...
...they're being cooked from the inside.
You're going to get sicker and sicker
until you can't move.
And then you will die.
Over there on the floor by the pool table...
with your buddies.
Ooh.
Don't mind me.
Sit tight.
We'll be right back.
Sheriff, come in.
Come in, Sheriff, over.
Randall, no one's heard from the sheriff
since last night
There  was a prison bus out there.
I think we better assume the worst.
You're on your own.
What about Jimmy or Bill?
Deputies are missing, too.
You're just going to have
to handle this yourself.
Don't think we forgot you, did you?
--Anything wrong, Miss?
--No, nothing.
Doesn't look like anybody's here.
Yeah, well, the pump's locked, so...
You know, there is this other place
that I can take you to.
Look, we're running on fumes as it is.
Make a sound, you die.
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't think anybody's home.
Ms. Sullivan...
--What a surprise.
--Hey, Bonnie.
Oxygen tanks, IVs,
all non-electrical medical supplies.
--When was that written?
--1957.
The population of Jericho was 1,000 people.
I'll start moving everyone.
I'll get the ventilation system fixed.
God, they chewed through everything.
Mind if I pitch in?
You know how to strip wires?
Ever since junior high.
Yeah, I was that popular.
All right, great.
Check the fan belt,
I think it's frayed.
Well, then you might want to get another one.
Any mid-century American car would
be a good match.
And check the brushers.
--We don't want the motor to seize up.
--Okay.
All right.
You take over.
I'll look for a fan belt.
Excuse me, sir.
You're doing that wrong.
April.
She thinks we shouldn't move the baby.
Ma'am, your baby's protected
in this little bubble.
She's got fresh air and food.
Right now, she's the safest
person in Jericho
but you're not.
We need to make sure she has
a mother to take care of her
when this thing is over, okay?
Please.
--Please, let us take you both
down to the shelter, okay?
--Mm-hmm.
Okay.
--Bobby.
--Jake Green?
Just a second, ma'am.
--obby, there's two in the nursery.
--I'm Emily Sullivan's aunt.
...taken to the shelter in our basement.
Mrs. Dawson, hi.
--Have you seen Emily?
--No, not since yesterday.
Maybe she's at the other shelter.
No one over there has seen her
and she's not at her house.
I heard you were back in town
--and I figured the one person who would know...
--I'm sorry.
I have to go.
If I see her, I'll tell her
you're looking for her
but I'm sure she's fine.
So we'll just, uh,
use your pump and be on our way.
Stanley has the key.
What did she just say?
Oh... her brother, Stanley,
he's got the key to the pump.
Wait a minute,
--she's deaf?
--Yes.
I read lips.
--When do you think Stanley gets back?
--Another hour.
--Whoa, whoa, whoa.
--What did she just say?
It's going to be about an hour.
Oh, we can wait an hour, can't we?
Ms. Sullivan, you all right?
Yeah, fine.
I'm just hungry.
Yeah, uh...
Why don't we make some food for the officers?
Oh,  I want eggs.
It's a farmhouse,
you've got eggs, right?
Yeah, why don't we, uh...
Why don't we all go make something to eat?
Sure.
People south of Main
go to you at Town Hall?
Yeah, that's right,
all those to the north of Main Street
go to the medical center.
--Johnston.
--Right, yeah, I know, you want me
to take it easy.
--I'm just going to go help Eric
get the supplies from Gracie.
--I've already sent people to do that.
Gail, who is in charge here, you or me?
You do not want to play that game.
Here's every book we have in the library
about nuclear radiation.
--Our Friend The Atom.
--Some friend.
Anything in here for grownups?
I'd like to know what we're supposed to do
if this town gets hit.
None of the books are specific.
Atom bombs have only gone off in
populated cities twice in history.
And Denver was probably hit
by a hydrogen bomb, anyway.
What's the difference?
Hydrogen bombs, they literally
explode the air.
So, what you're saying
is that nobody knows
what's really coming?
Then we pick worst case scenario.
--What needs to be done?
--One second, sir, I have that.
Let me just...
Anything left outside
will have to be scrubbed down.
And if it rains, the top
18 inches or so of soil
will have to be removed before planting again.
And tell everybody to cover
all the water wells.
That's about what it says, right?
Yes. Yes, that's right.
Well, you heard the man.
Jeff, let's make sure all the ranchers
get the livestock inside.
I'm going to work on the radio.
This may be our last chance
to make contact for a while.
There's a bunch of people in the church.
They held a vigil there all night.
I'm going to make sure they get into shelter.
--Hurry back.
--Yes, ma'am.
--I'm telling you they need to be replaced.
--Listen, girlie...
Please, don't argue with me.
don't tell me...
The brushers are shot,
it's revving too high. It's...
Turn them off!
Jake, everyone's ready.
--What do we do now?
--Don't let them in here!
The rain's going to be here soon.
People are getting scared.
Do we have air or not?
You seal them up in here
they're going to die.
Hello,Dad
Dad, can you hear me?
Dad's checking on the church, Jake
What do you need?
Our shelter's no good.
I'm bringing these people to Town Hall.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
Jake, I don't know how many more
people we can hold.
--What about the basement?
--They don't have basements, Eric.
That's why they came here.
Eric, we've got 200 people here.
Some of them need medical attention.
Handle it.
Look, I will be at Town Hall soon.
I'll check to see how much room we have.
--And I will call you back.
--I don't have time. We're coming.
--Sorry, my husband needs a kick sometimes.
--You don't have to apologize to me.
I've got to go to the shelter.
Bring everything you can.
H-How much more do you need?
--Enough to feed half the town, Gracie.
--Half the town?
Wait--
--Skylar, you have to come to the shelter.
--I'm not going to some stupid shelter.
I'm going home to wait for my parents.
--Don't be crazy.
--I'm not crazy!
--I'm going home.
--Fine.
Excuse me, ladie
Are you going to pay for those?
What are you talking about?
Everybody is just taking stuff.
This is still my store.
Is that for an emergency?
All right, you know what?
Fine, keep it.
Her parents are in New York, okay?
Who knows if they're even going to come back.
--It was just a couple cans of soda.
--They're my soda.
I say we head east.
She was headed east, wasn't she?
Hey, how far from here
would you say those crows were?
About five miles west
from where you picked me up.
Hell, then we'll go north.
Hey.
You want to help me out with the coffee?
Yeah, I'll show you where it is.
You better get down to that shelter.
--The  wind is moving faster than we thought
--I'm watching it.
Just get everybody underground.
You know, if you get that thing to work,
just do me a favor, and find
out who did this to us.
--Eric, come in.
--This is Eric, go ahead.
A couple of busloads coming to Town Hall.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
People, please!
Don't get off the bus.
--We can't take any more.
--Eric, what the hell are you doing?
They can't come in here, Jake.
--What do you mean they can't come in here?
--We're packed!
What? I got a whole bus full of
people here that need shelter.
You're really gonna turn away
all these people, Eric?
You're going to turn away your wife?
We let everybody in,
we'll all suffocate.
Eric, there are really sick people here
and the storm is coming!
Okay, we can take ten.
And I saved a spot for you.
All right, the ten most critical, fast.
Gray, the salt mine,
how many people will it hold?
As many as you want,
--but I don't think...
--It has a ventilation system, right?
--Yeah, and water.
--All right, it's the best option
we have right now, all right?
Mom?
Have you seen your father?
He told me he was going to the church.
Well, Gail, people from that church got
back 20 minutes ago.
Eric?
Mom, we'll find Dad.
--Jake, take your people to the mine.
Leave us 10.
--I'll go with you, Jake.
After 27 years, nobody knows
that mine the way I do.
I guess you can fit 11 people now.
Yeah, make it 12.
It's my place--
I should be there.
Yeah, let's go.
Hey.
We're going to be okay.
Hang on.
--That smells good.
--Oh, no, no, I'll get it.
Oh!
--I am so sorry.
--Damn it.
Oh, that looks bad.
Look, go in the kitchen right now
and run cold water over it.
It'll stop it before the blisters.
I'll clean up this mess.
--What happened?
--She...
I burnt my hand.
You left her alone?
She's fine.
Is he okay?
He'll live.
I can only get 12 down
on the elevator at a time!
That's the best I can do!
Shep, we have to seal the entrance.
There's no door, Jake.
Well, we can't just let the rain
pour down the shaft.
These people won't be safe.
--We won't be safe.
--Well, how do we seal it?
I don't know, but it's a mine.
--You got dynamite, right?
--Whoa, whoa...
--We put charges here, here, here...
--Are you crazy?
How do we know we won't bring
the whole thing down on top of us?
We don't.
I am going to the little girls' room.
--Hey, where is that?
--Right up the stairs.
--Right there, see?
--Good to know.
Straight back!
--Eric, any sign of Dad?
--No, not yet.
Checked the church, Main Street.
We're going through every inch
of Town Hall right now.
Listen, Eric,
I'm going to need you
to bring a crew over here
and dig us out when this thing's over.
What? What? Why?
--We're ready, Jake!
--Are you crazy?
Just dig us out-- and find Dad, okay?
Let's go.
Mr. Hawkins, did my father come through here?
No, I haven't seen him.
--Mom, check the offices again.
--Maybe we missed something.
I'll go check out the parking lot.
--Look, we'll find him, okay?
--Okay. Be careful. Be careful.
Could you use some help, ma'am?
No, we need you on the radio.
You know, I can't get this old thing to work.
--Okay, come.
--Fine.
Please.
You are not in my house.
Get off my property, right now.
And my property goes all the way down the hill.
You need to get back to town.
The radiation's coming from Denver.
I'm not leaving here.
My parents are on their way back.
--You talked to them?
--No, freak, the phones are dead.
But I'm not leaving here without them.
All right, stay inside,
tape up the windows,
and don't use the water.
--Don't tell me what to do.
--I'm serious, Skylar.
Stay inside.
Dale?
Dale, stop!
Please.
Stay here.
It's not safe out there.
Please stay here.
Jody, where you at?
All right, everybody...
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take some of that out, all right?
Seal the entrance, not cause a cave-in.
Hey.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I knew a guy once.
Did you blow him up?
Hello? Is anyone here?
--How does that look?
--It's good, that'll do.
--How we coming, Gray?
--This is the last of 'em.
--I'm almost done here.
--Same here.
This is Emily Sullivan.
We're at the Richmond Ranch with Bonnie.
Please, help us.
Can you hear me?
Is there anybody there?
What was that?
Did you hear that?
--Somebody's on the radio.
--This is Emily Sullivan.
--I'm at the Richmond Ranch.
--Everybody be quiet!
There are men here with guns.
I think they might have
killed the sheriff. Hello?
Can you hear me?
Emily! Emily!
Emily, can you hear me?
Emily.
Come in, come in.
Come in, can you hear me?
Is there anyone out there?
Is there anyone on this channel?
Can anyone here me?
Shep, give me your keys.
--Jake, it's gonna start raining any minute now.
--Give me your keys, I can make it.
--All right.
--Jake, you're out of your mind.
Gray, get everybody down there, all right?
--Hey, Jake?
--What?
When everybody's down,
say "all clear."
"All clear," okay?
Almost ready, Jake, stand by.
Come on, come on.
Jake?
We're all clear.
Johnston? Johnston?
Gail...
Oh, my God.
Mr. Hawkins!
Mr. Hawkins!
Mr. Hawkins!
Where's the brother?
Where the hell's the girl?
I think they might have killed...
I think they might have killed the sheriffs.
Please, help us.
Hello. This is Emily Sullivan.
I'm looking for the Jericho Police Department.
Can you hear me?
Is there anyone out there?
Is there anybody on this channel?
There are men here with guns.
I think they might have killed the sheriff.
Please, somebody help us.
Run, Emily,
run.
Hey! Hey!
Stop!
Stop!
Think this through! Let her go!
No.
We just want gas.
Supplies, that's all this is about.
It's just about fuel.
Let her go.
Look.
Please, please, let her go.
No.
Is this what you want to see?
Are you ready to talk now, Miss?
Please, let her go.
April...
April, come here.
Hey, Dad, can you tell me what happened?
Sit down.
Here, sit him down.
I just found him on the floor in his office.
Did you hit your head?
All right.
Bonnie, take him to the storm cellar now!
Go, guys, go!
Emily, we've got to get inside.
Emily? Emily, hey.
It's going to be okay
All right? I promise.
Everything is going to be okay, all right?
We've got to gin now, babe.
Babe?
We've got to get inside
before the rain, okay?
Come with me.
Come on.
Run. Run.
Get inside!
--Hey, Dad.
--Hey. How you doing?
You comfortable?
Just like camping.
You hate camping.
Yep.
Where's Allison?
--She's up in her room.
--Samuel, go get Ali.
Yes, sir.
--Tell her I'm home.
--Yes, sir.
Robert. Robert.
--What's happening out there?
--I don't know.
You know.
--You always know something.
--Hey, hey...
You are alive, Darcy,
okay?
And the kids are safe.
You know, don't ask me questions.
I think my mom died yesterday.
I think my mom died yesterday, too.
I thought you were gone.
--Emily...
--Why are you here?
Trying to keep you safe.
It's never safe around you.

Stay one more day.
I've got to get back
to san diego by tomorrow.
All right,it looks like the explosion
came from the west,maybe denver.
Are we under attack ?
it could've been a test,Could've
been an accident.
Hi,dale.
Sorry I didn't call sooner,angel,but we...

She was in atlanta.

Get april. We'll meet you at the medical center.
There's an empty prison bus out there.
look,I know you're telling people it was an
accident,but if it was an attack,sheriff...
There's chaos out there,you might not want the
wrong people knowing that jericho was still here.
Riley !
is there anybody on this channel ?
There are men here with guns.
I think they might have killed the sheriff.
Won't the rain clear
the radiation out of the air ?
Yes,and bring it straight down on jericho.
How do you know about
radiation,mr. Hawkins ?
Because I was a cop in st. Louis,
and after 9-11,we got up to speed.
How long before the radiation gets here ?
How long does it normally take
a storm to get here from denver ?
Less than two hours.
Everyone over here can go
to the town hall shelter.
All those on the north side
will go to the clinic.
Our shelter's no good.
I'm bringing these people to town hall.
They can't come in here,jake.
What do you mean they can't come in here ?
We're packed.
The salt mine,how many people will it hold ?
We have to seal the entrance.
There's no door,jake.
Well,we can't just let
the rain pour down the shaft.
These people won't be safe.
We're all clear.
what's happening out there ?
I don't know.
You always know something.
You know,don't ask me questions.
18 hours after the bombs
She's still not talking.
I get that.
I mean,I'm a cop.
I've never killed anybody.
She's a schoolteacher.
Where's stanley ?
Jake,my brother doesn't know about the radiation.
When the rain stops,he'll be back,don't worry.
Bonnie,I know stanley.
He'll be fine.
Jimmy: Jake,I got your brother.
He's with your dad.
Finally.
Eric,how's dad ?
He's good.
The town hall shelter is secure.
Listen,jake,where are you ?
I'm at the richmond'S.
As soon as the rain stops,get every digging
tool you can find and get to the mine.
I had to blow the entrance to keep the rain out.
These people have been sealed up way too long.
And I'm more worried the explosion might
have put some debris into the ventilator.
Enough to slow it down ?
Enough to shut it down.
We got to get them out.
We can't reach anyone at the mine.
We have no radio contact with anyone there.
Here,honey,take a little sip.
Okay,just a little. Pass it on.
Good,you guys,good.
Good,good,good.
One second.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
How you holding up ?
Oh,heather.
I think our students are taking it better than I am.
They just know there's nothing to be afraid of.
For them,it's just like a bad field trip.
I'll be fine.
Just having a hard time breathing.
Heather: It's all right.
Here,take a little water.
Yeah.
Good.
I have to get outside.
Heather: Soon.
Soon.
Is mr. Rennie okay ?
He's gonna be fine.
We just need to give him a
little bit of room,okay ?
Go on back.
I can't do this !
Got to get outside !
It's okay.
Deep breath,deep breatH.
you doing all right ?
Stupid question ?
How do you know the rain's radioactive ?
Denver's pretty far away.
Well,we don't know how many bombs
there were,we don't know...
What is it ?
Someone's up in the house.
Not more prisoners ?
stanley !
Bonnie,thank god.
No ! Hey,hey ! No !
Stanley,don't touch her.
The rain may be radioactive.
April,stanley seems to be okay.
I'd say he was in it for about 20 minutes.
Yeah,I was out at my cousin's,helping him
put the livestock up and got caught in it.
Is he vomiting ?
Jake: No,he's not.
Okay,do you have any iodine there ?
Bonnie,iodine ?
Hey,what's with all the tanks ?
What tanks ?
On my way home,I passed a line of tanks.
They were hauling ass towards denver.
Stanley,how many tanks did you see ?
Five,maybe.
Where ?
They were over the ridge. I couldn't
tell you exactly where they were.
But I was on pharr's mill road near I-70.
April,we have iodine.
He's going to need to take a couple of tablespoons.
But it tastes vile,so do you have any
bread,something that he could take with it ?
We're in a cellar...all we've got
is canned peaches and pickles.
Not the pickles.
Maybe the peaches.
Jake,just give me the iodine.
The second that the rain breaks,
rush him to the clinic.
And,jake...
if he throws up in the next couple
of hours,get bonnie out of that room.
Why ?
Because her brother's going to die.

There's nothing to worry about.
You're scaring the children,scott.

jake wants to talk to you.
His cough's getting much worse.
I want you to make it brief.
Okay,okay.
Yeah,son,what is it ?
Dad,stanley saw a line of tanks near I-70.
Well,you know,there's a national guard
unit to the southwest of there in goodland.
Maybe they've got a relief effort going.
We need to get out there and see.
That could be a dangerous thing to do,son.
Can't just sit around and wait
to find out what's happening.
I'll go to goodland.
Someone should check out topeka.
Okay,son.
I'm going with you.
What ?
I have to find roger,and goodland's
on the way to wichita.
You're in no condition to...
I'm going.
With you or I'm going by myself.
For the last time,you can't smoke here.
All right,waters for everyone.
Here you go.
Thank you,honey.
Johnston,I need to take your temperature again.
Oh,you just took it five minutes ago.
hasn't changed in five minutes.
The mighty johnston green felled by the flu.
Here it comes.
I don't know if I told you this,but
my father is impervious to mere germs.
Oh,really ?
Yeah,I believe that was the quote.
First inauguration...have it all on video.
It was a joke.
I was trying to...
april,don't ever make a mistake.
This family will never let you forget it.
Okay,I'll remember that.
Oh,come on.
But still...
shh,johnston.
I don't like him.
Me neither.
here.
They're really stale.
you know,I keep thinking about when we were kids
and how they used to make us practice hiding
under our desks in case of an atomic bomb.
Yeah,duck and cover.
That's the first thing I thought of
when I saw that mushroom cloud.
Did they have enough time to
hide under their desks ?
That's pretty stupid,huh ?
No.
Eric ?
I'm just a little confused.
Your wife isn't really acting like someone who
knows the marriage has been dead a long time.
Mary...
or did I get the wrong impression ?
Mary,let's just get through this,okay ?
Well,the next thing you're gonna tell me
is that she actually does understand you.
I'm sorry.
Jake,don't let bonnie see your lips.
Listen,man.
If this thing doesn't turn out so good...
the thing is,bonnie's still just a kid,so...
stanley.
Don't even,all right ? You're gonna be fine.
I don't know.
My head is pounding and I feel
like I'm gonna throw up.
eric,the rain has stopped.
Is it okay ?
what's this black stuff ?
That used to be denver.
Bill,emily,get stanley to
the medical clinic now.
Okay.
Find april,she'll know what to do.
Jimmy,you're coming with me
to the mine,all right ?
Jake.
I meant what I said,all right ?
I know.
Look,I know,I know.
I will help you find roger.
I promise,okay ?
Go,I'll meet you at the medical clinic.
Eric,we're coming to the mine now.
We have to dig those people out.
what was that ?  !
What was that ?  !
I think somebody's on the other side.
get these people out of here.
all right,everyone,you're gonna be okay.
All right,we have food and water.
And there are vehicles waiting for you
guys to take you to the clinic,all right ?
Nice and slow.
File out,these guys'll help you.
Listen,you're okay.
Women and children first.
Please.
Watch your step,everyone,be careful.
It's gonna be okay.
Are you okay ?
I think so.
Gray,what happened ?
He's dead.
What ?
Hey,how's stanley ?
We're still watching him.
Where is he ?
We had to isolate him.
Where ? Where is he ?
What the hell ?
Do you like it ?
It's where they make the contagious kids wait
so they don't give everybody chicken pox.
Did you throw up ?
Yeah,a couple times.
Apparently,that's what happens when
you drink a bottle of iodine.
I need to get back to the house.
I need to check on the livestock.
I need to check on the corn.
I need to get out of here.
There's really nothing you can do right now.
He's right.
You need to stay.
I'm really sick of being poked
with needles every ten minutes.
They'll be sorry when my spider powers kick in.
Well,you're still an idiot,so that's a good sign.
Mimi: How bad is it ?
Well,you're sleep deprived
like everyone else.
Bring the bandages to 102.
No,I mean the radiation.
Am I dying ?
Have you vomited ?
No.
Should I ?
You just need some rest; go home.
I'd like to.
When's the next flight to D. C.  ?
Dr. Green ?
Oh,there are a lot of people waiting.
If you could just...
I just want to know what happened to my friend.
Scott rennie.
It looks like he had a heart attack.
I'm sorry.
But...
so what if I have three queens,but I only have two jacks ?
I'm out.
I so bluffed you.
Skylar,are you still alive in there ?
Hey,what's up ?
Sky,are you home ?
Hello ?  !
dude,I'm starving.
What's up ? Oh,my god.
What's he doing here ?
This is not how it looks.
It sure looks how it looks.
Lisa: Skylar,wait.
That guy's a weirdo.
I can't just sit around here all day.
We've got to find the sheriff and
his men,we've got to get the power back on.
Okay,now you're going to stay
here as long as it takes.
Now,don't make me take your pants with me.
I can run this town without my pants.
It wouldn't be the first time.
All right.
That's a story I never want to hear.
Sweetheart.
How are you feeling,honey ?
My leg's a little sore,but...
how's everything here ?
Your father has the flu.
It's nothing.
Did you hear mr. Rennie died ?
It's terrible.
I've been thinking,more than anything,
this town needs information.
We could organize a group of people.
Send them out in every direction.
I don't think anyone should be leaving jericho.
We have to.
We can't just sit here in the dark.
He's right.
Makes us too vulnerable.
Abrams,you and crossfield are taking the
northern route up through nebraska to the
state police barracks in broken bow.
Well,I can go east to topeka and
connect with the state government.
Ridley can head west to denver.
Well,what's left of it.
You'll probably run into a ring of fema and ems
people before you even get within sight of the city.
See what they know.
What about you ?
He's going to wichita with me.
That's right,emily and i are taking
the southern route to wichita.
Well,let's try to radio back as much
information as possible along the way.
Jake: That's the plan.
Hitting the major cities in each
direction,north,south,east and west.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
Let's hope not.
Nope,we've still got static.
Try pointing it east.
We've got nothing,keep moving it.
Nope,just static.
Just keep trying.
Mary.
Excuse me.
Mary.
Man.
Busy place.
Yeah,although the service isn't
what it used to be.
what'll you have ?
Oh,my god.
We've got something !
where'd it go ? Come on,bring it back !
we're losing the feed ! Bring it back !
Go back. We had something.
was that korean ?
Does anybody know ?
I think it was chinese.
It was mandarin.
The question is,were they just reporting
it,or were they behind it ?
Did stanley say if there were any markings
on the side of the tank ?
No.
I mean,maybe we're being invaded.
Abrams and crossfield are out.
They won't drive into a war zone.
Yeah,well,i don't blame them.
Look,why don't we put this plan on hold right now ?
We saw one image; we'll probably see another one.
Going out is more important than ever,all right ?
If this country is at war,we need to know it.
Okay,we have los angeles,seattle and philadelphia.
What else did you see on the tv ?
I think seattle's wrong.
Okay.
Uh,could it have been portland ?
I don't think so.
I understand you lost some of your men ?
Yeah.
Need a volunteer,I'm available.
Thanks,mister...
hawkins.
Mr. Hawkins.
Do you have a family ?
Two kids.
I think it's best if we stick to
people who don't have families.
Um,excuse me ?
Mr. Cale ?
Something's been bothering me.
It's about mr. Rennie's death.
The mine was full of people from the clinic.
How come nobody called for a doctor ?
I don't want to talk about it.
I know you're upset.
You guys were close.
But he was my friend,too.
I worked with him for three years.
Gray: Hey,shep ?
We're heading out for supplies.
Why don't you give us a hand ?
You know,this whole thing has
been pretty hard on shep.
He lost a good friend today.
We all did.
Emily ?
Talk to me.
Was it the broadcast ?
Because we don't know what any of it means.
They got wichita.
Roger is deaD.
We don't know that.
I saw it on the map.
Your fianc ? might have made it.
How ?
What if his flight got diverted to des moines ?
Des moines' gone.
Emily,what if it was omaha,huh ?
Or tulsa.
What if they set down in the middle
of a cornfield in nebraska ?
He could be anywhere.
Plane went down trying to find a place to land.
Emily !
What if it exploded ?
What if he's dead ?
Emily.
He's gone,and I'm here with you.
You were supposed to be the one that was dead...
not him.
Just leave me alone,jake.
Go without me.
They took everything.
Oh,dale.
Thank god.
I looked everywhere for you.
Are you all right ?
I was so worried.
I was safe.
Good.
Gracie ?
Oh,what now ?
Gracie ?
We're closed,gail.
I'm out of everything.
That's why I'm here.
Some of the folks at the shelter brought
some stuff back,and I thought you could use it.
It's one box.
I'm out of business.
My train shipment was supposed
to come through on tuesday.
Without a delivery,these shelves are
gonna stay as empty as they are right now.
I don't have a freezer anymore.
Most of this stuff is going
to go bad any minute now.
I know.
Food's going bad all over town.
I need my shipment.
But we don't know if
we'll ever get the power back on.
Maybe we should cook it.
What ?
Everything,all of it.
As long as it's still good enough to eat.
are you okay ?
If you call radiation poisoning okay.
Were you out in the rain,too ?
Oh,heavens,no.
I touched a building when
we came out of the shelter.
Look,you can stop pretending.
What do you mean ?
I audited your farm.
Why do you care ?
Maybe I'm a nicer person than you.
Right.
Were you in the rain ?
Yeah,for about 20 minutes.
Well,you look pretty good.
Thanks.
Try to work out.
look,um...
you know I think I got the worst of it.
So as long as I'm okay,you should be fine.
You're really sweet.
and you still owe the irs $180,000.
Yeah,I know.
Every radio needs to be fully charged.
We'll stay in contact as long as we can.
Gray,the long-range ones are all charged.
They're in the storage unit.
All right,thanks.
Ridley,why don't you go pack up
the geiger counters and the flares ?
I'll meet you out there.
Gray,I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate what you're doing.
It's a gutsy move,and,uh,
the whole town thanks you.
Yeah,thanks.
What the hell happened out there ?
I've known scott rennie his whole life.
He's strong as an ox. I just...
I can't believe he's dead.
He was a good man.
Heart attack at his age.
Yeah,well,it wasn't a heart
attack that killed him.
What do you mean ?
It was poor planning.
What are you talking about ?
What I'm saying is that none of this would have
happened if that clinic shelter had been maintained.
You have a lot of people to answer to.
All right,that's enough.
No,that's not nearly enough.
I get back here,there's gonna be an investigation.
Hundreds of people could have died
'cause you dropped the ball.
Why don't we talk about this in my office ?
You dropped the ball,and it killed scott rennie.
In my office. Now.
right now these people need our leadership.
I will not have you tearing this town apart.
And when all this is over,if you and I are
still alive,you investigate your ass off.
In the meantime,if I hear any more talk like
that out of you,you and i are gonna have a problem.
Do we understand each other ?
Where's emily ?
She's not going.
Good.
You're not going alone,are you ?
Yeah.
Don't give me that look.
What look ?
You know what look.
That look.
Hey,I told you 7,500 times,I have watched you
drive away,not knowing if you were coming home.
I've earned a look.
I'm coming back.
Take care.
Let's go !
Ridley ?
Come on.
Shep ?
Taking ridley's place.
Going to denver.
You don't have to do this.
What about your family ?
I got to get out of here.
Shep,you'll get past this.
Yeah ?
Hey,heather.
Shep left this for you.
Thanks.
"Dear heather,"I want you to know
the truth about scott rennie.
"It was my fault.
"Gray wanted me to keep him quiet,
"and his heart went out.
"I should have called for a doctor,
but I was scared.
"I let him die.
"I'll never forgive myself.
"You were a good friend to scott.
"A better friend than I ever was.
Shep.
Well,they should be about 50 miles out by now.
Jake,are you still reading me ?
Jake ?
I lost him.
Shep,are you there ?
Shep ?
Eric,do me a favor.
I missed that last one,shep.
Can you say it again ?
Tell him I'm sorry.
Tell the family I'm sorry.
You're breaking up,shep.
Hey,gray,did you catch that ?
No.
No,I didn'T.
I don't know,that would make about 45 miles.
Right,so,in about an hour...
Jake,what are you doing back ?
You should be in wichita by now.
Smoky hill bridge is blocked.
What is that ?
It's a flight data recorder.
I thought they were supposed to be black.
Well,where'd you get it ?
A couple of pilots used the highway as
a landing strip with mixed results.
This is the only one I could get.
Were there any survivors ?
it was a commuter plane that didn't
make it,a 757 that was empty.
Well,where are they ?
Where'd they go ?
How do we listen to this ?
Do you have that old reel-to-reel laying around ?
Your father needs to hear this.
I'm going to go get him.
You okay ?
Yeah.
I'm a little freaked.
Dad's here.
I've gone through most of this
recording from the plane that crashed.
This is the last 30 seconds or so.
A lot of background noise. You can hear...
pilots from planes in the
area talking to each other.
Wait.
The kids.
Oh,yeah. Come on,girls. Let's go.
Is anyone on this frequency ?
There's no reply from atcc !
please advise
Ray-27 in emergency descend,
need coordinates for approach.
Give me full flaps; it's about to get bumpy.
This is chinook 116 heavy.
Missed our handoff to kansas city atcc.
Does anyone read us ? Over.
Chinook 116,this is glen 5-6,reading you.
We're bingo fuel,lost all vfr heading out of chicago.
Tried all frequencies; there's no one out there.
What does that mean ?
They're out of gas and blind.
Guys,this is primary 221.
I've got a mushroom cloud 16 kilometers
in height somewhere northwest over denver.
I've got a visual on two separate plumes...one over
in kansas city and one south somewhere in texas.
Does anyone read atc ?
Negative. There is no atcc anymore,chinook.
He's saying there's no traffic control.
There's 10,000 planes with no place to land.
That's about a million people in the air.
Are those f-16s ?
Right. Do you have a visual ?
Affirm. Prime missouri guard.
131st out of landburg.
These guys are hauling ass somewhere.
Chinook 116,this is glen 5-6.
We found a stretch of highway long enough.
Follow us in.
Setting down on final approach,stand by.
Here we go.
Flaps,I need more flaps.
Losing it.
I can't hold it.
we're sliding here.
pull up !
Pull up !
I can'T...
chinook 116,this is glen 5-6.
We found a stretch of highway long enough.
Chinook 116,this is glen 5-6.
We found A...
chinook 116,this is glen 5-6.
Trans shore...
we found a stretch of highway long...
emily,come here.
Roger was on trans shore 724,right ?
Yes.
Listen.
This is primary...
jake,what is this ?
Just listen. Background chatter.
My co-pilot's blind.
Still up and going,going to burn off some
fuel and then we're going to F...
chinook 116,this is glen 5-6.
This is trans shore 724.
We've set down in a field,gps malfunctioned.
I think we're north of kansas.
Minor injuries.
He's alive.
He's alive.
robert ?
There's,uh,music outside.
Yeah.
Yeah,the party.
Sounded like sam cooke from here,but,uh,there's a chance it could be kenny rogers.
oh,lord.
Robert,the kids would like to go.
To the party ?
Yes.
We're not ready.
Robert.
No.
No.
well,I'm glad there was enough food for everyone.
I just wish someone would've said thank you.
oh,it looks delicious.
thanks.
She looks so much better.
you really made her happy.
I owed her.
Well,I'd say this makes you even.
Not even close.
you haven't said two words all night.
just taking it all in.
It might be a long time before
we see jericho like this again.
I got to go.
What time is it ?
It's a little past midnight.
Do you really have to go ?
Yeah,I should probably go.

YDY proudly presents
Previously on Jericho...
Jake Green.
How you doing, man?
- Wait a minute, where the hell you been?
- Around.
Jake, no one's been around for five years.
Seriously...
where have you been?
Hey, brother.
- What you put this family through...
- Johnston, for God's sake...
- Now, he could've been...
- You could spend a week talking
about what I could've been, all right?
- Stay one more day.
- I gotta get back to San Diego by tomorrow.
All right, looks like the explosion
came from the west, maybe Denver.
- Are we under attack?
- This could've be a test,
could've been an accident.
Hi, Dale.
Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel, but we...
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I am so sorry.
- I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
- She was in Atlanta.
Oh, my God!
- My mom died yesterday.
- I think my mom died yesterday, too.
Get April.
We'll meet you at the medical center.
There's an empty prison bus out there.
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident,
but if it was an attack, Sheriff...
...there's chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people knowing
that Jericho was still here.
Riley!
Is there anybody on this channel?
There are men here with guns.
I think they might have killed the sheriff.
Won't the rain clear
the radiation out of the air?
- Yes, and bring it straight down
on Jericho. - How do you know
about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?
Because I was a cop in St. Louis
and after 9-11, we got up to speed.
How long before the radiation gets here?
How long does it normally take a storm to
get here from Denver?
Less than two hours.
Everyone over here can go
to the town hall shelter.
All those on the north side
will go to the clinic.
Our shelter's no good.
I'm bringing these people to town hall.
They can't come in here, Jake.
- What do you mean they can't come in here?
- We're packed.
The salt mine, how many people will it hold?
We have to seal the entrance.
There's no door, Jake.
Well, we can't just let the rain
pour down the shaft.
These people won't be safe.
We're all clear.
- What's happening out there?
- I don't know.
You always know something.
You know, don't ask me questions.
She's still not talking.
I get that.
I mean, I'm a cop.
I've never killed anybody.
She'a schoolteacher.
Where's Stanley?
Jake, my brother doesn't know
about the radiation.
When the rain stops,
he'll be back, don't worry.
Bonnie, I know Stanley.
He'll be fine.
Jake, I got your brother.
- He's with your dad.
- Finally.
- Eric, how's Dad?
- He's good.
The town hall shelter is secure.
Listen, Jake, where are you?
I'm at the Richmond's.
As soon as the rain stops,
get every digging tool you can
find and get to the mine
I had to blow the entrance
to keep the rain out.
These people have been sealed
up way too long.
And I'm more worried the explosion
might have put some debris
into the ventilator.
Enough to slow it down?
Enough to shut it down.
We got to get them out.
We can't reach anyone at the mine.
We have no radio contact with anyone there.
Here, honey, take a little sip.
Okay, just a little. Pass it on.
Good, you guys, good.
Good, good, good.
One second.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
Hey.
- How you holding up?
- Oh, Heather.
I think our students
are taking it better than I am.
They just know there's
nothing to be afraid of.
For them, it's just like a bad field trip.
I'll be fine.
- Just having a hard time breathing.
- It's all right.
Here, take a little water.
Yeah.
Good.
I have to get outside.
Soon.
Soon.
- Is Mr. Rennie okay?
- He's gonna be fine.
We just need to give him
a little bit of room, okay?
Go on back.
I can't do this!
- Got to get outside!
- It's okay.
Deep breath, deep breath.
You doing all right?
Stupid question?
Right.
How do you know the rain's radioactive?
Denver's pretty far away.
Well, we don't know how many bombs
there were, we don't know...
What is it?
Someone's up in the house.
Not more prisoners?
- Stanley!
- Bonnie, thank God.
No! Hey, hey!
No! Uh-uh.
Stanley, don't touch her.
The rain may be radioactive.
April, Stanley seems to be okay.
I'd say he was in it for about 20 minutes.
Yeah, I was out at my cousin's
helping him put the livestock up
and got caught in it.
Is he vomiting?
No, he's not.
Okay, do you have any iodine there?
Bonnie, iodine?
Hey, what's with all the tanks?
What tanks?
On my way home, I passed a line of tanks.
They were hauling ass towards Denver.
Stanley, how many tanks did you see?
- Five, maybe.
- Where?
They were over the ridge.
I couldn't tell you
exactly where they were.
But I was on Pharr's Mill Road near I-70.
April, we have iodine.
He's going to need to take
a couple of tablespoons.
But it tastes vile,
so do you have any bread,
something that he could take with it?
We're in a cellar-- all we've got
is canned peaches and pickles.
Not the pickles.
Maybe the peaches.
Jake, just give me the iodine.
The second that the rain breaks,
rush him to the clinic.
And, Jake...
if he throws up in the next couple of hours
get Bonnie out of that room.
Why?
Because her brother's going to die.
- Just concentrate on breathing, please
- I can't.
Got to get out of here.
- I know. Soon.
- I got to get out of here!
Mr. Rennie, please, just concentrate
on your breathing.
Look at me.
Controlled.
Very...
- I got to get out of here.
- I know, Mr...
I got to get out of here!
I don't want to die down here!
Get me out of here!
- I don't want to be here!
- Look, everybody just calm down.
There's nothing to worry about.
- You're scaring the children, Scott.
- I can't breathe.
- He's claustrophobic.
- We got to get him out of here.
- Look, it's me.
- I'm sorry.
It's Shep. Try to focus, man
- try to focus.
- I got to get out of here!
- We got to get him away from these people.
- I got to get out of here!
I can't breathe!
- I don't want to die down here!
- Please be careful!
Please!
Stay back.
I don't want to die down here!
I don't...
Get me out of here!
- Jake wants to talk to you.
- His cough's getting much worse.
- I want you to make it brief.
- Okay, okay.
Yeah, son, what is it?
Dad, Stanley saw a line of tanks near I-70.
Well, you know,
there's a National Guard unit
to the southwest of there in Goodland.
Maybe they've got a relief effort going.
We need to get out there and see.
That could be a dangerous thing to do, son.
Can't just sit around and wait
to find out what's happening.
I'll go to Goodland.
Someone should check out Topeka.
Okay, son.
I'm going with you.
What?
I have to find Roger,
- and Goodland's on the way to Wichita.
- You're in no condition to...
I'm going.
With you or I'm going by myself.
For the last time,
you can't smoke here.
- waters for everyone.
- Thank you, honey.
- Johnston, I need to take
your temperature again.
- Oh, you just took it five minutes ago.
- Shh...
- Hasn't changed in five minutes.
- The mighty Johnston Green
felled by the flu. - Here it comes.
I don't know if I told you this
but my father is impervious to mere germs.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I believe that was the quote.
- First inauguration-- have it all on video.
- It was a joke.
I was trying to...
April, don't ever make a mistake.
This family will never let you forget it.
Okay, I'll remember that.
- Oh, come on.
- But still...
- Shh, Johnston.
I don't like him.
Me neither.
Here.
They're really stale.
You know, I keep thinking about
when we were kids
and how they used to make us practice
hiding under our desks
in case of an atomic bomb.
Yeah, duck and cover.
That's the first thing I thought of
when I saw that mushroom cloud.
Did they have enough time
to hide under their desks?
That's pretty stupid, huh?
No.
Eric?
I'm just a little confused.
Your wife isn't really acting like someone
- who knows the marriage has
been dead a long time.
- Mary...
Or did I get the wrong impression?
Mary, let's just get through this, okay?
Well, the next thing you're gonna tell me
is that she actually does understand you.
I'm sorry.
Jake, don't let Bonnie see your lips.
Listen, man.
If this thing doesn't turn out so good--
- the thing is,
Bonnie's still just a kid, so... - Stanley.
Don't even, all right?
- You're gonna be fine.
- I don't know.
My head is pounding and I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.
Eric, the rain has stopped.
What's this black stuff?
That used to be Denver.
- Bill, Emily, get Stanley
to the medical clinic now. - Okay.
Find April, she'll know what to do.
- Jimmy, you're coming with me to ne,
all right? - Jake.
- I meant what I said, all right?
- I know.
Look, I know, I know.
I will help you find Roger.
- I promise, okay?
Go, I'll meet you at the medical clinic.
Eric, we're coming to the mine now.
We have to dig those people out.
What was that?!
I think somebody's on the other side.
Get these people out of here.
All right, everyone,
you're gonna be okay.
All right, we have food and water.
And there are vehicles waiting for you guys
to take you to the clinic, all right?
Nice and slow.
File out, these guys'll help you.
Listen, you're okay.
Women and children first.
Please. Watch your step,
everyone, be careful.
It's gonna be okay.
- Are you okay?
- I think so.
Gray, what happened?
He's dead.
What?
Hey.
- Hey, how's Stanley?
- We're still watching him.
Where is he?
- We had to isolate him.
- Where? Where is he?
What the hell?
Do you like it?
It's where they make
the contagious kids wait
so they don't give everybody chicken pox.
- Did you throw up?
- Yeah, a couple times.
Apparently, that's what happens
when you drink a bottle of iodine.
I need to get back to the house.
I need to check on the livestock.
I need to check on the corn.
I need to get out of here.
- There's really nothing you
can do right now. - He's right.
- You need to stay.
- Yeah...
I'm really sick of being poked with
needles every ten minutes.
They'll be sorry when my
spider powers kick in.
Well, you're still an idiot,
so that's a good sign.
Yeah.
How bad is it?
Well, you're sleep deprived
like everyone else.
Bring the bandages to 102.
No, I mean the radiation.
Am I dying?
- Have you vomited?
- No. Should I?
- You just need some rest; go home.
- I'd like to.
When's the next flight to D.C?
Dr. Green?
Oh, there are a lot of people waiting.
- If you could just... - I just want
to know what happened to my friend.
Scott Rennie.
It looks like he had a heart attack.
I'm sorry.
But...
So what if I have three queens,
but I only have two jacks?
- I'm out.
- I so bluffed you.
- Skylar, are you still alive in there?
- Hey, what's up?
Sky, are you home?
- Hello?!
- Hey...
- Hey...
- Dude, I'm starving.
- What's up?
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing here?
This is not how it looks.
It sure looks how it looks.
Skylar, wait.
That guy's a weirdo.
I can't just sit around here all day.
We've got to find the sheriff and his men,
- we've got to get the power back on.
- Okay, now you're going to
stay here as long as it takes.
Now, don't make me take your pants with me.
- I can run this town without my pants.
- It wouldn't be the first time.
- Huh.
- All right.
That's a story I never want to hear.
Sweetheart.
How are you feeling, honey?
My leg's a little sore, but...
how's everything here?
- Your father has the flu.
- It's nothing.
Did you hear Mr. Rennie died?
It's terrible.
I've been thinking,
more than anything,
this town needs information.
We could organize a group of people.
Send them out in every direction.
- I don't think anyone should be
leaving Jericho. - We have to.
We can't just sit here in the dark.
He's right.
Makes us too vulnerable.
Abrams, you and Crossfield are taking
the northern route
up through Nebraska to the state police
barracks in Broken Bow.
Well, I can go east to Topeka
and connect with the state government.
Ridley can head west to Denver.
Well, what's left of it.
You'll probably run into a ring
of FEMA and EMS people
before you even get
within sight of the city.
See what they know.
What about you?
He's going to Wichita with me.
That's right, Emily and I are taking the
southern route to Wichita.
Well, let's try to radio
back as much information
as possible along the way.
That's the plan.
Hitting the major cities in each direction
north, south, east and west.
- The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
- Let's hope not.
Nope, we've still got static.
Try pointing it east.
We've got nothing,
keep moving it.
Nope, just static.
Just keep trying.
Mary.
Excuse me.
Mary.
Man.
Busy place.
Yeah, although the service
isn't what it used to be.
What'll you have?
Oh, my God.
We've got something!
- Where'd it go?
- Come on, bring it back!
We're losing the feed!
- Bring it back!
- Go back. We had something.
Was that Korean?
- Does anybody know?
- I think it was Chinese.
It was Mandarin.
The question is, were they just reporting it
or were they behind it?
Did Stanley say if there were any markings
- on the side of the tank?
- No.
- I mean, maybe we're being invaded.
- Abrams and Crossfield are out.
- They won't drive into a war zone.
- Yeah, well, I don't blame them.
Look, why don't we put this plan
on hold right now?
We saw one image;
we'll probably see another one.
Going out is more important
than ever, all right?
If this country is at war,
we need to know it.
Okay, we have Los Angeles,
Seattle and Philadelphia.
- What else did you see on the TV?
- I think Seattle's wrong.
- Okay. Uh, could it have been Portland?
- I don't think so.
Hey.
- I understand you lost some of your men?
- Yeah.
Need a volunteer, I'm available.
- Thanks, Mister...
- Hawkins.
Mr. Hawkins.
- Do you have a family?
- Two kids.
I think it's best if we stick to people
who don't have families.
Hey. Em?
Um, excuse me? Mr. Cale?
Something's been bothering me.
It's about Mr. Rennie's death.
The mine was full of people from the clinic.
How come nobody called for a doctor?
I don't want to talk about it.
I know you're upset.
But he was my friend, too.
I... I worked with him for three years.
Hey, Shep?
We're heading out for supplies.
Why don't you give us a hand?
You know, this whole thing
has been pretty hard on Shep.
He lost a good friend today.
We all did.
Emily?
Talk to me.
Was it the broadcast?
- Because we don't know
what any of it means.
- They got Wichita.
Roger is dead.
- We don't know that.
- I saw it on the map.
- Your fiancé might have made it.
- How?
What if his flight
got diverted to Des Moines?
Des Moines' gone.
Emily, what if it was Omaha, huh? Or Tulsa.
What if they set down in the middle of
a cornfield in Nebraska?
He could be anywhere.
Plane went down trying
to find a place to land.
- What if it exploded?
- Emily.
- What if he's dead?
- He's gone, and I'm here with you.
- Emily.
You were supposed to be the one
that was dead... not him.
Just leave me alone, Jake.
Go without me.
They took everything.
Oh, Dale.
Thank God.
I looked everywhere for you.
Are you all right?
I was so worried.
- I was safe.
- Good.
Gracie?
Oh, what now?
Gracie?
We're closed, Gail.
- I'm out of everything.
- That's why I'm here.
Some of the folks at the shelter brought
some stuff back,
and I thought you could use it.
It's one box.
I'm out of business.
My train shipment was supposed
to come through on Tuesday.
Without a delivery,
these shelves are gonna stay
as empty as they are right now.
I don't have a freezer anymore.
- Most of this stuff is going
to go bad any minute now.
- I know. Food's going bad all over town.
I need my shipment.
But we don't know if we'll ever
get the power back on.
Maybe we should cook it.
- What?
- Yeah. Everything, all of it.
As long as it's still good enough to eat.
Are you okay?
If you call radiation poisoning okay.
Were you out in the rain, too?
Oh, heavens, no.
I touched a building
when we came out of the shelter.
Oh.
Look, you can stop pretending.
What do you mean?
I audited your farm.
Why do you care?
Maybe I'm a nicer person than you.
Right.
Were you in the rain?
Yeah, for about 20 minutes.
- Well, you look pretty good.
- Thanks.
Try to work out.
Look, um... you know I think
I got the worst of it.
So as long as I'm okay,
you should be fine.
You're really sweet.
- And you still owe the IRS $180,000.
- Yeah, I know.
Every radio needs to be fully charged.
We'll stay in contact as long as we can.
Gray, the long-range ones are all charged.
- They're in the storage unit.
- All right, thanks.
Ridley, why don't you go
pack up the Geiger counters and the flares?
I'll meet you out there.
Gray, I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate what you're doing.
It's a gutsy move, and, uh,
- the whole town thanks you.
- Yeah, thanks.
What the hell happened out there?
I've known Scott Rennie his whole life.
He's strong as an ox.
I just...
I can't believe he's dead.
He was a good man.
- Heart attack at his age.
- Yeah, well, it wasn't a heart
attack that killed him.
- What do you mean?
- It was poor planning.
What are you talking about?
What I'm saying is that none of this
would have happened
if that clinic shelter had been maintained.
- You have a lot of people to answer to.
- All right, that's enough.
No, that's not nearly enough.
I get back here,
there's gonna be an investigation.
Hundreds of people could have died
'cause you dropped the ball.
- Why don't we talk about this in my office?
- You dropped the ball,
and it killed Scott Rennie.
In my office. Now.
Right now these people need our leadership.
I will not have you tearing this town apart.
And when all this is over,
if you and I are still alive,
you investigate your ass off.
In the meantime, if I hear any more
talk like that out of you,
you and I are gonna have a problem.
Do we understand each other?
- Where's Emily?
- She's not going.
Good.
- You're not going alone, are you?
- Yeah.
Don't give me that look.
- What look?
- You know what look. That look.
Hey, I told you 7,500 times
I have watched you drive away
not knowing if you were coming home.
I've earned a look.
I'm coming back.
Let's go!
Ridley?
Come on.
Shep?
Taking Ridley's place.
Going to Denver.
You don't have to do this.
What about your family?
I got to get out of here.
Shep, you'll get past this.
Yeah?
- Hey, Heather.
- Oh.
- Shep left this for you.
- Thanks.
"Dear Heather,
"I want you to know the truth
about Scott Rennie.
"It was my fault.
"Gray wanted me to keep him quiet,
"and his heart went out.
"I should have called
for a doctor, but I was scared.
"I let him die.
"I'll never forgive myself.
"You were a good friend to Scott.
"A better friend than I ever was.
Shep."
Well, they should be about
50 miles out by now.
Jake, are you still reading me? Jake?
I lost him.
Shep, are you there? Shep?
Eric, do me a favor.
I missed that last one, Shep.
Can you say it again?
Tell him I'm sorry.
Tell the family I'm sorry.
You're breaking up, Shep.
Hey, Gray, did you catch that?
No.
No, I didn't.
- I don't know, that would make
about 45 miles. - Right, so,
in about an hour...
- Jake, what are you doing back?
- You should be in Wichita by now.
- Smoky Hill Bridge is blocked.
- What is that?
It's a flight data recorder.
- I thought they were supposed to be black.
- Well, where'd you get it?
A couple of pilots used the highway
as a landing strip with mixed results.
- This is the only one I could get.
- Were there any survivors?
It was a commuter plane that didn't make it,
a 757 that was empty.
Well, where are they?
Where'd they go?
How do we listen to this?
- Do you have that old reel-to-reel
laying around? - Yeah.
Your father needs to hear this.
I'm going to go get him.
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm a little freaked.
Dad's here.
I've gone through most of this recording
from the plane that crashed.
This is the last 30 seconds or so.
A lot of background noise. You can hear...
pilots from planes in the area
talking to each other.
Wait.
The kids.
Oh, yeah. Come on, girls. Let's go.
Is anyone on this frequency?
There's no reply from ATCC!
Please advise. Ray-27 in emergency descend,
need coordinates for approach.
Give me full flaps; it's about to get bumpy.
This is Chinook 116 heavy.
Missed our handoff to Kansas City ATCC.
Does anyone read us? Over.
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6, reading you.
We're bingo fuel,
lost all VFR heading out of Chicago.
Tried all frequencies;
there's no one out there.
What does that mean?
They're out of gas and blind.
Guys, this is Primary 221.
I've got a mushroom cloud 16 kilometers
in height somewhere northwest over Denver.
I've got a visual on two separate plumes--
one over in Kansas City and one
south somewhere in Texas.
- Does anyone read ATC? - Negative.
There is no ATCC anymore, Chinook.
He's saying there's no traffic control.
There's 10,000 planes with no place to land.
That's about a million people in the air.
Whoa! Are those F-16s?
Right. Do you have a visual?
Affirm. Prime Missouri Guard.
131st out of Landburg.
These guys are hauling ass somewhere.
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
We found a stretch of highway long enough.
Follow us in. Setting down
On final approach, stand by.
Here we go.
Flaps, I need more flaps.
Losing it.
I can't hold it.
We're sliding here.
- Pull up! Pull up!
- I can't...!
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
We found a stretch of highway long enough.
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
We found a...
- Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
- Trans Shore...
We found a stretch of highway long...
Emily, come here.
- Roger was on Trans Shore 724, right?
- Yes.
Listen.
- This is primary...
- Jake, what is this?
- Just listen.
My co-pilot's blind. Background chatter.
- Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
- This is Trans Shore 724.
We've set down in a field,
GPS malfunctioned.
I think we're north of Kansas.
Minor injuries.
He's alive. He's alive.
Robert?
There's, uh, music outside.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the party.
Sounded like Sam Cooke from here, but, uh
there's a chance it could be Kenny Rogers.
Oh, Lord.
Robert, the kids would like to go.
- To the party?
- Yes.
We're not ready.
- Robert.
- No.
No.
Well, I'm glad there was
enough food for everyone.
I just wish someone would've said thank you.
Oh, it looks delicious.
Thanks.
She looks so much better.
You really made her happy.
- I owed her.
- Well, I'd say this makes you even.
Not even close.
You haven't said two words all night.
Just taking it all in.
It might be a long time before
we see Jericho like this again.
I got to go.
What time is it?
It's a little past midnight.
Do you really have to go?
Yeah, I should probably go.
Previously on Jericho:
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west
maybe Denver.
Are we under attack?
This could've been a test.
Could've been an accident.
Look, I know you're telling
people it was an accident
but if it was an attack, Sheriff
and there's chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people knowing
that Jericho is still here.
Dale Turner's mother died tonight
in another explosion
--Atlanta.
--Oh, my God.
--Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?
--Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho.
A direct, concentrated hit.
Anyone exposed too long...
How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?
Stanley.
No, hey! No, uh-uh.
Stanley, don't touch her.
How do you know the rain's radioactive?
Denver's pretty far away.
Well, we don't know
how many bombs there were.
Oh, my God.
We got something!
Are they just reporting it
or are they behind it?
Maybe we're being invaded.
If this country is at war,
we need to know it.
More than electricity or food,
this town needs information.
--We can't just sit here in the dark.
--He's right.
Makes us too vulnerable.
We could organize a group of people
send them out in every direction
--The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
--Let's hope not.
I'm telling you, it's the Midwest.
From the skyline, I'm thinking Cincinnati.
I wish we could read the license plates.
Let's make Cincinnati a question mark.
--Jake.
--Hey, Stanley. Hey, Bonnie.
--Anything new?
--No, not since yesterday.
Shep and Gray should have been back by now.
Our radios went silent about 50 miles out.
God, it makes you wonder
what happened to whoever shot this.
I think that might have been
the last thing they ever saw.
The generator's running out of gas.
We're going to lose the TV.
I'll take care of it.
How can you?
Gas pumps don't work at the station
with the power down.
Look, I don't want you to worry.
Sorry, folks.
We're closing early tonight.
Take a flashlight,
it's dark out there.
What? It's only 9:30.
You heard her,
let's move it, folks.
Time to go home.
Let's move it out.
--Hey.
--Hey.
--Is the generator out?
--No, out of booze.
--Any more images?
--No, just the same loop.
Come on, I'll walk you home.
Where do you live?
That way.
So is it weird being home after so long?
A little bit.
I still can't get used to Bailey's
without the mechanical bull.
Stanley must have cried
when they took that out.
He had the record.
When did the Pizza Garden
become the Cyberjolt Cafe?
Oh, when the Health Department
shut down the Pizza Garden.
What?!
--Oh, don't tell me you liked the Pizza Garden.
--I used to work there washing dishes.
Oh, you must not have done a very good job.
That came from the alley.
It's the pharmacy.
Why don't you go get some help?
Help...
H... Help.
Jake.
Who is he?
I don't know. Help me get him out of here.
Not without gloves or a hazmat suit.
We got to get him to a doctor, now.
Is that radiation sickness?
I think it might be.
--Heather, Heather.
Get her out.
--Okay. Let's go.
Come on, Bill, let's go.
--Help us pick him up.
--I'm not touching him.
No way. Not me.
He could be contagious.
He's not contagious, Bill.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
What if it was me lying here, Bill?
Would you walk away then?
We could get sick touching that guy.
It's not like with you, Stanley.
We don't even know who this guy is.
I just stopped by Bailey's
to check on the TV signal.
--Can't you cut your husband some slack?
--And that took three hours?
--I was only there for, like, an hour.
--We're in a state of emergency, Eric.
I'm aware of that, April.
Dr. Peterson's gone to Kansas City
to look for his daughter.
--And Dr. Hoder's worked the last 24 hours.
--Well, I am here now.
--What do you want from me?
--And you... decided to go have a beer.
I've got a baby on a ventilator
and the generator is almost out of gas.
Well, don't you have a hand pump?
Who'd pump it?
Out of the way.
Out of the way.
Out of the way!
--April, he's having trouble breathing.
--Get him in Room Three.
Who is that?
Who's in there?
Hello?
Who is that?
--It's just me, Mrs. Leigh.
--Oh, Dale.
What are you up to?
--You scared me to death.
--It was supposed to be a surprise.
What?
Oh...
Where did you get all this?
The train that never showed up.
It smashed into a car.
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.
It's just about five miles outside of town.
Well, we can't just take it, it's not ours.
Not all of it, anyway.
The town took your food.
Well, it was an emergency.
And so is this.
The hell with them.
Who is this man?
Anyone recognize him?
Not so far.
Those burns...
--Does that mean that he was close to the blast?
--Why'd he come to Jericho?
--It's a hell of a way from Denver.
--Maybe he's related to someone in town.
Then why'd he break into the pharmacy?
--Any I.D.?
--No, just some keys.
He doesn't even have a wallet.
--Is he going to be okay?
--Depends on the dose that he got.
Son, you and Stanley should go wash up.
--Those clothes might still be contaminated.
--There's a shower down the hall.
Dad.
We got another situation.
There's not much more gas
in the generator here.
Bailey's tavern went dark tonight.
That was the only satellite dish
in town getting a signal
our only link to the outside world.
--You okay?
--Yeah.
We're going to have to get people to siphon
gas out of their cars.
What if more come?
There's not enough gas to keep the clinics
going for all of them.
--You saying we ought to turn them away?
--No, I'm saying we have limited resources.
Well, for right now, let's just get
as much as we can.
Some of the nurses are spooked.
They're worried about contamination.
Honey, I'll do anything I can to help you.
If you could, keep an eye on this baby
then I could see to the other patients.
Sure.
I hope to God the power doesn't go.
Look, we'll do everything we can
until we can't.
Dad, it's Sam.
Dad, I'm thirsty, are you in there?
--Any word from Shep or Gray?
--No, Mayor.
Still can't get 'em on the radio.
Maybe they got captured by
those tanks Stanley saw.
Those tanks are probably just National Guard
--okay? So--
--You don't know that.
--They could be--
--Shh.
They could be China,
they could be Iran.
Al Qaeda, North Korea--
anybody who hates us.
They could be coming here and what's
our line of defense?
You're looking at it.
Jake?
Oh.
Had to take a shower.
--Go ahead.
--No, I I did; I just took a shower.
Oh, right.
So what's up?
I...
April said that the medical
center was running low
on gasoline for the generator
and it occurred to me that
if we had a length of hose
and a funnel, we could siphon
gas out of our cars.
Then it occurred to me there's all that gas
in the tanks at Murthy's gas station
and if we could get enough suction we could
get all the gas we wanted...
Would a water pump do it?
Bonnie.
This could be my brother.
--Is this how they die?
--No. Stanley didn't get it this bad.
--He could still got cancer.
--No, we don't know that.
Listen.
Don't worry about me,
I'll be fine.
Take care of him.
I'm going to have to put him on a ventilator
it'll use up power but--
But the baby has the better chance for survival
--save the generator for the baby.
--Hey, hey, hey, what about him?
Give him something for the pain.
--Keep him comfortable.
--Sit back and watch him die.
Well, I don't like it, Jake,
but that's the most rational
option we have right now.
Unless you can think of something better.
--Will your generator last until morning?
--I think so.
All right, give me until then.
Can you tell me your name?
Victor.
Miller.
Victor.
Victor, you're in a medical clinic.
--Okay, we're going to take care of you.
--No, no.
They're coming.
They're coming.
So how long do you think he'll be unconscious?
Could be a long time.
If he ever wakes up again.
Who are "they"?
Who's coming?
Well, maybe he saw passengers
from one of those planes.
He could've meant terrorists.
Unless he wakes up,
we don't know what kind of danger we're in.
For right now,
hire as many deputies as you can
use them to help you get gas.
Clinic's running low.
But it's not my gas,
it belongs to Noraco.
It's no use to anyone, Mr. Murthy.
Without electricity, the pumps don't even work.
--And we'll leave you an I.O.U. for the 500 gallons.
--I could be fired.
With all due respect, who's going to fire you?
It's a different world now, Mr. Murthy.
All right, let's get them open.
Stanley will be here any second.
They're never coming back.
The district manager, any of them.
Are they?
No.
Shortly after my mother died,
my husband was transferred to St. Louis.
It was hard to leave Memphis,
because it was our home.
But eventually we learned to love it.
How did your mother die?
M.S.
Aly,
what area of St. Louis are we from?
--Kirkwood.
--Which is where?
--Near Powder Valley.
Lots of hiking, trails and nature.
We love to hike.
--Sam, where'd you go to school?
--The Crow School.
Crow Island School.
God, we've gone over this so many times.
And we'll go over it again and again
until we get it right.
Mom...
You know what, I can't keep doing this.
Keep Samuel inside.
I've got my story.
Hey.
We lived in a two-bedroom house
we drove a green Volvo,
we had a stay-at-home mom, which is bull
because she worked all the time
because our dad was never around.
Upstairs. Go on.
--You got a minute?
--Of course.
You probably heard the, uh,
Sheriff's been killed, along with
three more of our men.
I heard.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Well, we're down to just me and Bill, and
neither of us is trained for
a national emergency.
I don't think anyone is prepared for this.
We need a few more deputies.
--And I thought since you were a cop in
St. Louis and all...
--No.
It's a very flattering offer, but I'm still
settling my family.
It'd just be for the time being.
Look, Mr. Hawkins, people are on edge.
All right, we've got break-ins
and kids vandalizing.
We just need some more manpower to show people
there's still law and order in this town.
All right.
When do I start?
You're already on the clock.
We're asking everyone in town to donate
five gallons of gas.
Sorry, honey.
I need my car.
But, Gracie, if the clinic
goes down, people could die.
I sympathize, Eric,
but I already gave this town my whole store.
Someone else can donate gas.
Bill.
What's up?
I'm going to head to the clinic
with what I've got.
How are things on your end?
It's not looking good.
We're still 90 gallons short at the clinic.
People are scared, Eric.
They're hoarding.
Maybe we can't afford to be so polite.
I couldn't find an empty pesticide container.
--I thought this water tank might do.
--No, no, we can't use steel.
There's too much risk of static.
One spark, the whole thing could blow sky-high.
We don't have time to look for something else.
Well-well, who's going to fill it?
--Well, what do you want to do, draw straws?
--No, I'll do it, you got Bonnie to take care of.
Don't be a martyr.
I've already been irradiated.
--I'm doomed.
--No, you're going to live to be 100, remember?
--Our pacts never work out.
--Let's just do this before we
think about it too much.
Get off the truck, Stanley.
Get off the truck.
Back up.
Hey, Allison.
This place has been a zoo all day.
--Uh, that's $1.69.
--Okay.
--You got the last bag of corn chips.
--I'll give you 20 bucks for them.
--She picked them up first.
--Fine, I'll give you the 20.
Or how about this?
I'm having a party.
If you give me the chips, then I'll invite you.
--I don't even know you.
--So?
It's not like there's anything else to do.
You're awesome.
Come by anytime, it's the big house
at the top of the Pines.
Okay, well, thanks, I guess.
Hi.
Oh, God...
The generator's down!
Somebody call April. Hurry.
We've lost all his machines.
--He's not breathing.
--Okay, I've got to get to the baby
and I only have one hand pump.
You used to be a nurse, Gail.
You'll do fine.
Let's go.
Keep a steady pace.
Uh, guys, we have a problem.
It's stuck.
No, no... Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!
Don't feel bad.
--I'll loosen it up for you.
--No. The gas has been sloshing around in there
building up fumes.
--If you force the cap, and it sparks...
--What do you want to do, huh?
Look, with all the static electricity built up
we could blow the thing to kingdom come.
That was dumb.
All right, here, get that to him.
Let's go!
I can't get a heartbeat.
Let's go!
All right, got it.
Go, Stanley.
How's he doing?
--He was down for about two minutes.
--I need help with the cardiac feed.
See that black switch?
Can you turn that on?
Oh, right.
I invited you.
--Oh, yeah, but, you know I don't...
I don't have to...
--No, forget it. Come in.
Hey, where's April?
Come on.
Come on.
April...
I got 75 gallons of gas.
For the generator.
Thanks.
We got it covered.
Sky, look who invited himself.
Just put it over there.
Why are you such a jerk when
you're with your friends?
--Did I interrupt a lover's spat?
--Stop it, Lisa.
You know what?
I'm gonna go home.
I only came here 'cause you begged me to.
Just... go home.
Victor!
Victor. It's okay.
April!
April!
Vic...
Victor, you said they're coming.
Who's coming?
They need... help.
Who does?
Who needs help?
20 from... Denver.
Where are they, huh?
Where are they?
Lake... A lake?
--Boat. Boat dock.
--A lake with a boat dock?
A lake with a boat dock.
What road is it on, do you remember?
I...
have my... daughter.
--...coming...
--April!
Can I help you?
Hey, turn that down.
--Yeah, we had a complaint that
you're using too much power.
--And?
--And... the party's over.
--You can't do this.
--This is a private home.
--All right, everybody pack it up.
--How much gas you using to run this place, Skylar?
--None of your business.
It's my generator, it's my gas.
Right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Just go home.
Jimmy. Jimmy!
You got to get over here.
We found Shep's truck.
Bill?
No sign of Shep,
but look what I found inside.
Looks like Victor Miller forgot his wallet.
This is the man you were talking about?
The... The stranger in the hospital?
Yeah. You recognize him?
No.
I just think we should ask him what
he did with your friend Shep.
April, we need to talk to Victor Miller.
--He's unconscious.
--I think you need to wake him up.
No.
Still the same stuff.
Look at all the people running.
What if they come here?
Hey.
You worked a miracle.
Generator's full; we can go three more days.
Great, three days.
Hey.
Everything's going to be all right.
You know, when you say it, I almost believe it.
Eric, you there?
Go, Jimmy.
We found Shep's truck.
Meet us at the clinic.
I'm on my way.
It doesn't matter.
We have got to go look for his family.
Why'd he have Shep's truck?
We need to know what he did with him.
--I know, but we can't just torture a dying man.
--No one is torturing anyone.
We could give him a shot of adrenaline.
--It'll wake him up enough to question him.
--He's dying of third degree burns.
--It'll be like waking him up on fire.
--Uh...
Our people are dying out there.
Shep may already be dead.
--We need to protect ourselves, Jake.
--We need to protect ourselves from this.
Jake, Shep, he's one of us.
--We need to find out what this guy did to him.
--Hey, he is going to die, anyway.
But he could save some people's lives.
Eric.
--I'd like to do this myself.
--No, I'm not leaving him.
Okay.
What's going on in there?
--They're asking him a few questions.
--Like hell they will. That's my patient.
--Let go of me.
--We need information.
You have no right.
--He could be a murderer.
--And that gives you the power
to do anything that you want?
Yes.
Yes.
Victor, it's going to be okay.
We'll make this quick, all right?
Hey.
The car you drove here--
did someone give it to you?
No, no.
It was...
It was... on the side...
of the road.
Okay. It... It was... running.
Okay, okay.
--But was there anybody in it?
--No.
I had... to help them.
Where are they?
--Do you remember anything else about the lake?
--It burns.
--Was it off a dirt road?
--It burns.
--He needs morphine.
--Was your daughter at Bass Lake?
--Y-Yes.
--He needs morphine, Jake.
--Please, please.
Hey. Hey!
We said families only, hmm?
--Why? Why did you go back to Denver?
--I...
--I couldn't let them die.
--It was a mistake, Vic,
--because now we are a man down.
--No. Some... some...
S-Someone... Someone flipped.
A traitor.
There's...a tra... traitor.
Do you know who it was?
Come on, man, tell me.
--Vic, who was it?
--I...
Tell me.
Do you know who it was?
You... know.
He's gone.
We had to do it.
I thought you were going to a party, hon.
You're worth ten of her.
--Ten of who?
--Skylar Stevens.
--She's not a bad person.
--Hmm.
We're not like them.
They can be nice sometimes, but
don't be fooled.
That's what my mom used to say.
Well, she was a smart lady.
You scared?
'Cause I remember when I did something wrong
waiting for my old man to come home.
Baby, what you did today--
that wasn't just you going to a party.
It wasn't.
You put your mother,
your brother,
all of us at risk.
Do you hear?
And if you pull something like this again
girl, you have no idea how scared you'll be.
I need a few volunteers.
There's a group of people just outside of town.
No way, man! It's too dangerous out there!
They're at Bass Lake.
They may have radiation sickness.
We need to bring them here
get them to the clinic
before it's too late.
--Turn it back on!
--We've seen it.
We've seen it 100 times.
A man just died in our clinic. Our clinic!
He was traveling with his daughter
and about 20 other people.
All right, it could have been
Shep or Gray or any of us.
They need our help.
Are we going to help them?
Or are we just going to sit here watching
the same three images over and over?
Jake?
I'll donate gas if you need
to fill your car to get them.
--Thank you, Mary.
--I'll go with you.
Thank you.
Anybody else?
--I'll go with you, Jake. I'll go.
--Let's go.
--Yeah, me, too.
--Thank you.
Earlier today, we buried 20 people--
refugees from Denver.
People we didn't know,
but were prepared to welcome into our town.
Unfortunately, they died of radiation poisoning
before we could reach them.
For those people from Denver,
and for our own people,
for Sheriff Dawes and Deputy Riley
for Deputy Conner and Deputy Salem...
...for people out there
somewhere we know nothing about
who might be suffering and dying right now--
I ask that we take a moment of silence.
If you've lost a loved one,
would you please stand?
If someone you love is missing,
would you join those standing?
We stand because we know
that every life matters.
We have to fight for every life,
even when it seems hopeless,
even when we're afraid,
because the battle ahead
isn't just for our survival
it's for our humanity.
I think I'm going to be okay.
Jake. Hi.
You're a good man for trying
to help someone you didn't even know.
--Hey, you thirsty again?
--No. Couldn't sleep.
--Where did you go to school, Sam?
--Crow Island.
--Who is your dad?
--You.
--Who loves you more than anything in the world?
--You.
And, Sam,
--who is always going to take care of you?
--Mommy.

Previously on jericho all right,it looks
like the explosion came from the west,maybe denver.
Are we under attack ?
This could've been a test.
Could've been an accident.
Look,I know you're telling people it was
an accident,but if it was an attack,sheriff,
and there's chaos out there,you might not want the
wrong people knowing that jericho is still here.
Dale turner's mother died
tonight in another explosion.
Atlanta.
Oh,my god.
Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air ?
Yes,and bring it straight down on jericho.
A direct,concentrated hit.
Anyone exposed too long...
how do you know about radiation,mr. Hawkins ?
Stanley.
No,hey !
Stanley,don't touch her.
How do you know the rain's radioactive ?
Denver's pretty far away.
Well,we don't know how many bombs there were.
oh,my god.
We got something !
Are they just reporting it or are they behind it ?
Maybe we're being invaded.
If this country is at war,we need to know it.
More than electricity or food,
this town needs information.
We can't just sit here in the dark.
He's right.
Makes us too vulnerable.
We could organize a group of people,
send them out in every direction.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
Let's hope not.
4 days after the bombs
1 day after the fallout has cleared
I'm telling you,it's the midwest.
From the skyline,I'm thinking cincinnati.
I wish we could read the license plates.
let's make cincinnati a question mark.
Jake.
Hey,stanley.
Hey,bonnie.
Anything new ?
No,not since yesterday.
Shep and gray should have been back by now.
Our radios went silent about 50 miles out.
God,it makes you wonder what
happened to whoever shot this.
I think that might have been
the last thing they ever saw.
the generator's running out of gas.
We're going to lose the tv.
I'll take care of it.
How can you ?
Gas pumps don't work at the
station with the power down.
Look,I don't want you to worry.
Sorry,folks.
We're closing early tonight.
Take a flashlight,it's dark out there.
What ? It's only 9:30.
You heard her,let's move it,folks.
Time to go home.
Let's move it out.
Is the generator out ?
No,out of booze.
any more images ?
No,just the same loop.
Come on,I'll walk you home.
Where do you live ?
That way.
So is it weird being home after so long ?
A little bit.
I still can't get used to bailey's
without the mechanical bull.
Stanley must have cried when they took that out.
He had the record.
When did the pizza garden
become the cyberjolt cafe ?
Oh,when the health department
shut down the pizza garden.
What ?  !
Oh,don't tell me you liked the pizza garden.
I used to work there washing dishes.
Oh,you must not have done a very good job.
that came from the alley.
It's the pharmacy.
Why don't you go get some help ?
help...
sync:fisherchen, hoodman
YDY proudly presents
Jake.
Who is he ?
I don't know.
Help me get him out of here.
Not without gloves or a hazmat suit.
We got to get him to a doctor,now.
is that radiation sickness ?
I think it might be.
Heather,heather.
Get her out.
Okay.
Let's go.
Come on,bill,let's go.
Help us pick him up.
I'm not touching him.
No way. Not me. He could be contagious.
He's not contagious,bill.
I'm sorry,stanley.
What if it was me lying here,bill ?
Would you walk away then ?
We could get sick touching that guy.
It's not like with you,stanley.
We don't even know who this guy is.
I just stopped by bailey's to check on the tv signal.
Can't you cut your husband some slack ?
And that took three hours ?
I was only there for,like,an hour.
We're in a state of emergency,eric.
I'm aware of that,april.
Dr. Peterson's gone to kansas city
to look for his daughter.
And dr. Hoder's worked the last 24 hours.
Well,I am here now.
What do you want from me ?
And you...decided to go have a beer.
I've got a baby on a ventilator and
the generator is almost out of gas.
Well,don't you have a hand pump ?
Who'd pump it ?
Out of the way.
Out of the way !
April,he's having trouble breathing.
Get him in room three.
who is that ?
Who's in there ?
Hello ?
Who is that ?
it's just me,mrs. Leigh.
Oh,dale.
What are you up to ? You scared me to death.
It was supposed to be a surprise.
What ?
where did you get all this ?
The train that never showed up.
It smashed into a car.
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.
It's just about five miles outside of town.
Well,we can't just take it,it's not ours.
Not all of it,anyway.
The town took your food.
Well,it was an emergency.
And so is this.
The hell with them.
Who is this man ?
Anyone recognize him ?
Not so far.
Those burns...
does that mean that he was close to the blast ?
Why'd he come to jericho ?
It's a hell of a way from denver.
Maybe he's related to someone in town.
Then why'd he break into the pharmacy ?
any I. D.  ?
No,just some keys.
He doesn't even have a wallet.
is he going to be okay ?
Depends on the dose that he got.
son,you and stanley should go wash up.
Those clothes might still be contaminated.
There's a shower down the hall.
dad.
We got another situation.
There's not much more gas in the generator here.
Bailey's tavern went dark tonight.
That was the only satellite dish in town getting
a signal,our only link to the outside world.
you okay ?
Yeah.
We're going to have to get people
to siphon gas out of their cars.
What if more come ?
There's not enough gas to keep the
clinics going for all of them.
You saying we ought to turn them away ?
No,I'm saying we have limited resources.
Well,for right now,let's just
get as much gas as we can.
Some of the nurses are spooked.
They're worried about contamination.
Honey,I'll do anything I can to help you.
If you could,keep an eye on this baby,
then I could see to the other patients.
Sure.
I hope to god the power doesn't go.
Look,we'll do everything we can,until we can't.
menphis
dad,it's sam.
vacations
dad,I'm thirsty,are you in there ?
Any word from shep or gray ?
No,mayor.
Still can't get 'em on the radio.
Maybe they got captured by those tanks stanley saw.
Those tanks are probably just national guard okay ?
So...you don't know that.
They could be...shh.
They could be china,they could be iran.
Al qaeda,north korea...anybody who hates us.
They could be coming here and
what's our line of defense ?
You're looking at it.
Jake ?
Had to take a shower.
Go ahead.
No,i I did; I just took a shower.
Oh,right.
So what's up ?
I...
April said that the medical center was
running low on gasoline for the generator,
and it occurred to me that if we had a length of
hose and a funnel,we could siphon gas out of our cars.
Then it occurred to me there's all that gas
in the tanks at murthy's gas station
and if we could get enough suction
we could get all the gas we wanted...
would a water pump do it ?
Bonnie.
This could be my brother.
Is this how they die ?
No. Stanley didn't get it this bad.
He could still got cancer.
No,we don't know that.
Listen.
Don't worry about me,I'll be fine.
Take care of him.
I'm going to have to put him on a
ventilator,it'll use up power but...
but the baby has the better chance for
survival,save the generator for the baby.
Hey,hey,hey,what about him ?
Give him something for the pain.
Keep him comfortable.
Sit back and watch him die.
Well,I don't like it,jake,but that's the
most rational option we have right now.
Unless you can think of something better.
Will your generator last until morning ?
I think so.
All right,give me until then.
can you tell me your name ?
victor.
Miller.
Victor.
Victor,you're in a medical clinic.
Okay,we're going to take care of you.
No,no.
They're coming.
They're coming.
So how long do you think he'll be unconscious ?
Could be a long time.
If he ever wakes up again.
Who are "they" ?
Who's coming ?
Well,maybe he saw passengers
from one of those planes.
He could've meant terrorists.
Unless he wakes up,we don't know
what kind of danger were in.
For right now,hire as many deputies
as you can,use them to help you get gas.
Clinic's running low.
But it's not my gas,it belongs to noraco.
It's no use to anyone,mr. Murthy.
Without electricity,the pumps don't even work.
And we'll leave you an I. O. U. For the 500 gallons.
I could be fired.
With all due respect,who's going to fire you ?
It's a different world now,mr. Murthy.
All right,let's get them open.
Stanley will be here any second.
They're never coming back.
The district manager,any of them.
Are they ?
No.
Shortly after my mother died,
my husband was transferred to st. Louis.
It was hard to leave memphis,
because it was our home.
But eventually we learned to love it.
How did your mother die ?
M. S.
Aly,what area of st. Louis are we from ?
Kirkwood.
Which is where ?
Near powder valley.
Lots of hiking,trails and nature.
We love to hike.
Sam,where'd you go to school ?
The crow school.
Crow island school.
God,we've gone over this so many times.
And we'll go over it again and again,
until we get it right.
Mom...
you know what,I can't keep doing this.
Keep samuel inside.
I've got my story.
We lived in a two-bedroom house,we drove
a green volvo,we had a stay-at-home mom,
which is bull,because she worked all
the time because our dad was never around.
upstairs. Go on.
You got a minute ?
Of course.
You probably heard the,uh,sheriff's been killed,
along with three more of our men.
I heard.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Well,we're down to just me and bill,and
neither of us is trained for a national emergency.
I don't think anyone is prepared for this.
We need a few more deputies.
And I thought since you were
a cop in st. Louis and all...
no.
It's a very flattering offer,but
I'm still settling my family.
It'd just be for the time being.
Look,mr. Hawkins,people are on edge.
All right,we've got break-ins and kids vandalizing.
We just need some more manpower to show people
there's still law and order in this town.
All right.
When do I start ?
You're already on the clock.
We're asking everyone in town
to donate five gallons of gas.
Sorry,honey.
I need my car.
But,gracie,if the clinic goes down,
people could die.
I sympathize,eric,but I already
gave this town my whole store.
Someone else can donate gas.
Bill.
What's up ?
I'm going to head to the
clinic with what I've got.
How are things on your end ?
It's not looking good.
We're still 90 gallons short at the clinic.
People are scared,eriC.
They're hoarding.
Maybe we can't afford to be so polite.
I couldn't find an empty pesticide container.
I thought this water tank might do.
No,no,we can't use steel.
There's too much risk of static.
One spark,the whole thing could blow sky-high.
We don't have time to look for something else.
Well-well,who's going to fill it ?
Well,what do you want to do,draw straws ?
No,I'll do it,you got bonnie to take care of.
Don't be a martyr.
I've already been irradiated. I'm doomed.
No,you're going to live to be 100,remember ?
Our pacts never work out.
Let's just do this before
we think about it too much.
Get off the truck,stanley. Get off the truck.
Back up.
Dale: Hey,allison.
This place has been a zoo all day.
Uh,that's $1. 69.
Okay.
You got the last bag of corn chips.
I'll give you 20 bucks for them.
She picked them up first.
Fine,I'll give you the 20.
Or how about this ? I'm having a party.
If you give me the chips,then I'll invite you.
I don't even know you.
So ?
It's not like there's anything else to do.
You're awesome.
Come by anytime,it's the big house
at the top of the pines.
Okay,well,thanks,I guess.
Hi.
oh,god...
the generator's down !
Somebody call april.
Hurry.
We've lost all his machines.
He's not breathing.
Okay,I've got to get to the baby
and I only have one hand pumP.
You used to be a nurse,gail.
You'll do fine.
Let's go.
Keep a steady pace.
Uh,guys,we have a problem.
It's stuck.
No,no...
wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait !
Don't feel bad.
I'll loosen it up for you.
No.
The gas has been sloshing around
in there,building up fumes.
If you force the cap,and it sparks...
what do you want to do,huh ?
Look,with all the static electricity built up,
we could blow the thing to kingdom come.
That was dumb.
All right,here,get that to him.
Let's go !
I can't get a heartbeat.
Let's go !
All right,got it. Go,stanley.
how's he doing ?
He was down for about two minutes.
I need help with the cardiac feed.
See that black switch ?
Can you turn that on ?
oh,right.
I invited you.
Oh,yeah,but,you know I don'T...I don't have to...
no,forget it.
Come in.
Hey,where's april ?
Come on.
Come on.
april...
I got 75 gallons of gas.
For the generator.
Thanks.
We got it covered.
sky,look who invited himself.
Just put it over there.
Why are you such a jerk when you're with your friends ?
Did I interrupt a lover's spat ?
Stop it,lisa.
You know what ?
I'm gonna go home.
I only came here 'cause you begged me to.
Just...
go home.
victor !
you're okay.
April !
april !
Vic...
victor,you said they're coming.
Who's coming ?
they need...
help.
Who does ?
Who needs help ?
20 from...denver.
Where are they,huh ?
Where are they ?
Lake...
a lake ?
boat. Boat dock.
A lake with a boat dock ?
A lake with a boat dock.
What road is it on,do you remember ?
I...
have my...daughter.
Coming...
april !
can I help you ?
Hey,turn that down.
Yeah,we had a complaint that you're using too much power.
And ?
And...
the party's over.
You can't do this.
This is a private home.
all right,everybody pack it up.
how much gas you using to run this place,skylar ?
None of your business.
It's my generator,it's my gas.
Right.
What ?  !
Just go home.
Jimmy.
Jimmy !
You got to get over here. We found shep's truck.
Bill ?
No sign of shep,but look what I found inside.
Looks like victor miller forgot his wallet.
This is the man you were talking about ?
The...
The stranger in the hospital ?
You recognize him ?
No.
I just think we should ask him
what he did with your friend shep.
April,we need to talk to victor miller.
He's unconscious.
I think you need to wake him up.
No.
Still the same stuff.
Look at all the people running.
What if they come here ?
You worked a miracle.
Generator's full; we can go three more days.
Great,three days.
Everything's going to be all right.
You know,when you say it,I almost believe it.
Eric,you there ?
Go,jimmy.
We found shep's truck.
Meet us at the clinic.
I'm on my way.
It doesn't matter.
We have got to go look for his family.
Why'd he have shep's truck ?
We need to know what he did with him.
I know,but we can't just torture a dying man.
No one is torturing anyone.
We could give him a shot of adrenaline.
It'll wake him up enough to question him.
He's dying of third degree burns.
It'll be like waking him up on fire.
our people are dying out there.
Shep may already be dead.
We need to protect ourselves,jake.
We need to protect ourselves from this.
Jake,shep,he's one of us.
We need to find out what this guy did to him.
Hey,he is going to die,anyway.
But he could save some people's lives.
Eric.
I'd like to do this myself.
No,I'm not leaving him.
Okay.
What's going on in there ?
They're asking him a few questions.
Like hell they will. That's my patient.
Let go of me.
We need information.
You have no right.
He could be a murderer.
And that gives you the power to do anything that you want ?
Yes.
Yes.
victor,it's going to be okay.
We'll make this quick,all right ?
the car you drove here...did someone give it to you ?
No,no.
It was...
it was...
on the side...of the road.
Okay.
it was...running.
Okay,okay.
But was there anybody in it ?
No.
I had...to help them.
Where are they ?
Do you remember anything else about the lake ?
It burns.
Was it off a dirt road ?
It burns.
He needs morphine.
Was your daughter at bass lake ?
Y-yes.
He needs morphine,jake.
Please,please.
We said families only,hmm ?
Why ?
Why did you go back to denver ?
I couldn't let them die.
It was a mistake,vic,
because now we are a man down.
s-someone...
Someone flipped.
A traitor.
There'S...
a tra...traitoR.
Do you know who it was ?
come on,man,tell me.
vic,who was it ?
Tell me.
Do you know who it was ?
you...know.
lead fail
he's gone.
We had to do it.
I thought you were going to a party,hon.
You're worth ten of her.
Ten of who ?
Skylar stevens.
She's not a bad person.
We're not like them.
They can be nice sometimes,but don't be fooled.
That's what my mom used to say.
Well,she was a smart lady.
you scared ?
'Cause I remember when I did something wrong,
waiting for my old man to come home.
Baby,what you did today--
that wasn't just you going to a party.
It wasn'T. You put your mother,
your brother,all of us at risk.
Do you hear ?
And if you pull something like this again,
girl,you have no idea how scared you'll be.
I need a few volunteers.
There's a group of people just outside of town.
No way,man !
It's too dangerous out there !
They're at bass lake.
They may have radiation sickness.
We need to bring them here get them
to the clinic before it's too late.
Turn it back on !
We've seen it.
We've seen it 100 timeS.
A man just died in our clinic.
Our clinic !
He was traveling with his daughter
and about 20 other people.
All right,it could have been
shep or gray or any of us.
They need our help.
Are we going to help them ?
Or are we just going to sit here watching
the same three images over and over ?
Jake ?
I'll donate gas if you need
to fill your car to get them.
Thank you,mary.
I'll go with you.
Thank you.
Anybody else ?
I'll go with you,jake.
I'll go.
Let's go.
Yeah,me,too.
Thank you.
Earlier today,we buried 20 people...
refugees from denver.
People we didn't know,but were
prepared to welcome into our town.
Unfortunately,they died of radiation
poisoning before we could reach them.
For those people from denver,and for our
own people,for sheriff dawes and deputy riley,
for deputy conner and deputy salem...
for eople out there somewhere we know nothing
about who might be suffering and dying right now...
I ask that we take a moment of silence.
If you've lost a loved one,would you please stand ?
If someone you love is missing,
would you join those standing ?
We stand because we know that every life matters.
We have to fight for every life,
even when it seems hopeless,even when we're afraid,
because the battle ahead isn't just for our survival,
it's for our humanity.
I think I'm going to be okay.
Jake.
Hi.
You're a good man for trying to help
someone you didn't even know.
we have a traitor
we have a traitor,the rally point
is no longer secure
sending...
hey,you thirsty again ?
No.
Couldn't sleep.
Where did you go to school,sam ?
Crow island.
Who is your dad ?
You.
Who loves you more than anything in the world ?
You.
And,sam,who is always going to take care of you ?
Mommy.

Homeland security?
That's what they said.
So they're in charge now?
Well,they're supposed to be in charge in case of a disaster.
So what happens next?
Why are you asking her?She's from the irs.
She's from D.C.
This is what they told us.
First,they restore power,then communication,then transportation.
I am this close to non-fat lattes and shiatsu.
Does anybody have a quarter?
If they can call in,maybe we can call out.
calling roger
hey,did your phone ring?
Yeah,everyone's did.
All the land lines in town.
Why?
Because kansas has a reverse 911 system.
If there's an emergency,it just pulses out a call.
That's what we all heard.
Why can't we call out?
Everybody's trying to use the phone at the same time.
System's overloaded.
You think the power's back for good?
I don't know,I'm not gonna count on it.
Hey,skylar.
Any luck?
No.
I really need to check my e-mail.
I mean,my parents could've tried to contact me from new york.
Well,have you tried typing a straight ip address?
A what?
It's weird.
What?
Well,the internet was built by the military.
It's supposed to survive nuclear war.
So why can't I check my e-mail?
Allison.
Is it working now?
it is,but...
not for us.
We're being blocked out.
Uh,miss?
You can't do thaT.
Yeah,okay,thanks.

Your machine just ate my card.
Doesn't work.
That's what I tried to tell you.
Thank you.
You're just so helpful.
Hey,dad.
It's the same thing on every channel?
So far.
What about the radio?
Same message-- sit and wait.
You look like crap.
I didn't sleep.
Next time put the cards down,go home.
Sooner or later,the phones are gonna free up.
Let's keep calling out until we reach somebody.
Calling who?
Well,that homeland security message came out of topeka; let's start there.
Yeah,but everybody's thinking that.
I say we start with the national guard base in great bend.
That's a good idea,son.
We should get to the gas station,get some gas while...
I already sent jimmy.
He's there now running the pumps.
All right,well,we need to charge our batteries.
All right.
Looks like you got it covered.
Where you going?
Home.
You take a shower?
Nothing gets past you.
Go clean the tub and fill it up.
Why?
The water doesn't get to that shower by magic.
If the power goes out again,so do the pumps that get it there.
So we store what we can.
That is why...
she is your daughter,rob,not your employee.
Well...
she needs to talk less and listen more.
You need to learn to ease up on her.
Darcy...
I don't know how long I'll be here,so whatever i gotta teach her,it needs to happen now.
you know,when we find out what's going on,are you gonna stay or leave?
Don't think about that yet.
Well,I can't help it.
I finally have you back.
you were always good at blocking out the bad.
Dad,not so much.
He's had more to block out.
When you left,you left quite a mess.
You have no idea of the lengths you father went to to square things.
Then why didn't he talk to me?
Because he knew you'd resent it.
And there's a stubborn streak that runs in the family.
Honey...
I think you owe him the truth.
You want me to tell him about my...
about my time away?
This house is too small for big secrets.
what was that?
It's a power spike.
Boys.
wow,looks like business as usual.
How'd you get your kids back so quick?
Always lead with recess.
Emily: Got to get things back to normal.
Whatever that is.
Go!Go!Go!
Hurry,hurry!

Go find your buddy and go sit behind the fence.

Come on,quickly.
Go.
Is she going to wake up?
Yes.
With super powers?
Probably not.
Now,go.Go!
Go,lucas,go!
Come on,emily,come on.
Wake up.
Wonder when they're going to come.
You really can't wait to fly this coop,huh?
Are you still going to file that irs report on my farm?
That's not exactly my first order of business,
but it is the reason I fell into this godforsaken hellhole in the first place.
So is that a yes,no or maybe?
It's an eventually.
Look,if it were up to me,I'd see what I could do.
But that's probably justthe irish coffee talking.
You got a family back home?
I have fish.
I'm sure they really miss you.
I wonder what that's about.
Mary,keep my tab open,will ya?
Your tab,stanley?
Yeah,and keep the irish coffees coming.
Till I get my farm back at least.
You heard the hillbilly.

Electrical fire.
Spray water on electricity everybody it touches gets fried.

The horses are safe.
What about the stables?
There's nothing but dirt around for miles.
They're fine.
You are not going to that fire.
I let chief carrol and half the department go to denver.
We're down to a handful of men.
Who can handle it.
Johnston,if you get any sicker than you already are,you're not going to be any use to anybody.
Dad,dad,are you still there?
Yeah,eric,I'm on my way.
No,no,no,no,go downstairs and turn off the power grid to the library.
Give me five minutes.
Looks like you get your way.
They can use me here.
Good.
The power should be cut in five minutes.
Get your men in position.
Cover one-seven four blocks east of maple.

All right,that's it,power's down.
Okay,open them up.
They're on.
Okay.
What's going on?
We lost pressure.
Oh,my god.
Pumping station must be on the same power grid as us.
When we lost power to one...we cut into both.
Where's the pumping station?
Up the hill at the end of chaparral.
Unhook those hoses.
See if there's a working hydrant around back.
Right,chief.
hey,jake.
Stanley.
Thank god.
Chaparral,pumping station,let's go.

Nah,they said they cleared the building.
Are you sure?
Ventilate that areA.
Eric,what are you doing?
Eric,no!
I wonder what lindsay lohan is doing right now.
Do you think she's still alive?
I'm trying to find my parents,lisa.I could care less.
Great.
My battery's almost dead.
Excuse me,sorry.
Do you guys sell phone chargers?
Um,what kind of phone?
I'll check the back.

Why do you like stupid,bulimic actresses?
Whoa,incoming.

Is anyone hurt?
Probably.

This one says universal,so it should work.
Um,we were going to go check out the fire.
If you want to...
Dale.

I should stay.
But if you want,I could charge it and you could come back.
Okay.

Better do what the angry fireman says.Let's go.
Come on,this way,let's go!

Thanks,stanley how do you even know this is it?
Trust me,it's the manual override.
When the power spiked the solenoid valves shut down in the off position.
What?
Dude,you're freaking me out.How do you even know that?
How do you not?
Looks like nobody's touched it in years.
Nobody has.
The motor opens and closes it when the power's on.
No power,no motor.
Yeah,and no water.
Of course,right now what we really need is leverage.
You know what?
Wait right here.
you can't go in there,ma'am.
My husband's in there!
Stand back,please.
Ashlee,we're going to go out another way.
Are you okay?

Smoke!
We got to stop it.
Okay,okay,uh,can we use this?

It's all going to be okay,ashlee.
It's going to be okay.

This'll protect you and help you breathe.

Somebody has to go in there and help them!
Ma'am,stay back,please.
oh,my god.
Are you hurt?
No,don't worry about me.
The little girl,she got a lot of smoke.
April,can you take her?
All right,yeah.
You're gonna be okay,ashlee.

I want to see if they have water down at the library.
Listen...
this scope was a christmas present,okay?
Relax.
Careful.

They've got water at the library.
What about the south side fire?
Looks like the fire's out down by the trailer park.
There's a lot of smoke.
There's another fire.
It's in the east woods.
What?!
It's right near eric's house.
What the hell?
What is it,jake?What's going on?

Eric,eric,there's another fire.
We'll get to it as soon as we can.
We need help clearing the alley.
Eric.
The fire's spreading.
Eric,it's heading to your house!
What do you want to do?
It's heading to your house.
There's nothing to do.
We're already spread too thin.
If we don't stop the fire,it could take out main street.
April?
he's right.
hardware
What are you planning to do?
Put out a fire.
Do you need a hand?
I'm good.
If I knew anything,I would tell your mayor.
What do you know?
Not much.
I got the same message as everyone else.
Do you want my help?
Get in.
first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to D.C.
Is burn these clothes.
So,what's on your agenda once things settle?
No agenda.
Just looking forward to living my life.
With dudley do wrong?
Never gonna happen.
That's really none of your business.
Besides...
you don't know eric the way I do.
Mercifully.
But I know his kind.
Guys like that don't leave wives for girls like us.
"Girls like us"?
I've been around this particular block before.
Well,I'm sorry to blow your theory,but...
eric is telling his wife about us tonight.
Is he now?
Yes,he is.
Well,never mind,then.
To the happy couple.
get up a littlehigher by that chimney.
Hey,we got it!
We got it!Save your house!
What now?
Water.
Let's use the pool pump.
Filter system.
That's pretty smart,jake.
So where'd you learn to do all this?
I was a pool guy.
turn it on!
Turn it on!
what?
Turn on the pump!
Hawkins!
Hawkins!
Come on.
What the hell are you doing?
Fire knocked out the power...
so I found my own.

That was quick thinking.
Yeah,I was a pool guy,too.
How you doing,ashlee?
I'm okay.
Minor smoke inhalation,but she's gonna be okay.
You saved her life.
Are the other fires still going?
The south side's under control.
The one near your house?
I haven't heard.My wife...
hey,where's april?
You're still here.
Yeah.
Did my parents...
sorry.
It's charged,though.
You going home now?
Are you gonna stay here all night?
Don't have anywhere else to go.
The fire moved through the trailer park.
It's all gone.
Oh,dale,I am so sorry.
It's okay.
No,it's not.
Why are you being so calm about it?
Don't have much of a choice.
How 'bout,scream?
Cry.Hit something.Break something.
Come on.
Where are you going?
We'll start with the mayor.
We'll get him to give you a place to live and some clothes and some money.
I can take care of myself.I'll be okay.
I was just trying to help.
I know.
I know.

Probably seen the light of day maybe half a dozen times since I've had it.

Yeah.
Seemed kind of silly to be staring at a blank screen,waiting for god-knows-who to tell me god-knows-what.

But I want to watch.
Then pay your tab.
Okay,I'm going.
Check it out,check it out.
It's something else every day.
How are we going to handle all this?
Same way we did today.
We lost a few buildings but no lives.
And that is,in no small part,thanks to you.
A lot of folks are saying how lucky jericho is to have you back again.
And what are you telling them?
Well,I've tried to correct them,but nobody listens to me.
you know what the hardest part about growing up your son was?
It's not the politics,or the expectations,it'S...
it's that I always knew you were a good judge of character,and you thought mine was lousy.
When I left town,I was determined to prove you wrong,but...
but instead,everywhere I went,I seemed to prove you right.
Dad...
I wasn't just in san diego.
I don't care.
What?
I don't care.
If you need to tell me,I'll listen,but...
wherever you went,whatever you did,it changed you.
And a stupid little punk may have left home,but a pretty decent fellow came back.
I can live with that.

That's what we all heard.
Why can't we call out ?
Everybody's trying to use the phone at the same time.
System's overloaded.
You think the power's back for good ?
I don't know,I'm not gonna count on it.
Hey,skylar.
Any luck ?
No.
I really need to check my e-mail.
I mean,my parents could've tried
to contact me from new york.
Well,have you tried typing a straight ip address ?
A what ?
It's weird.
What ?
Well,the internet was built by the military.
It's supposed to survive nuclear war.
So why can't I check my e-mail ?
Allison.
Is it working now ?
it is,but.
not for us.
We're being blocked out.
Uh,miss ?
You can't do thaT.
Yeah,okay,thanks.
welcome to kansas liberty bank
card held
Your machine just ate my card.
Doesn't work.
That's what I tried to tell you.
Thank you.
You're just so helpful.
Hey,dad.
It's the same thing on every channel ?
So far.
What about the radio ?
Same message.sit and wait.
You look like crap.
I didn't sleep.
Next time put the cards down,go home.
Sooner or later,the phones are gonna free up.
Let's keep calling out until we reach somebody.
Calling who ?
Well,that homeland security message
came out of topeka; let's start there.
Yeah,but everybody's thinking that.
I say we start with the national
guard base in great bend.
That's a good idea,son.
We should get to the gas station,
get some gas while.
I already sent jimmy.
He's there now running the pumps.
All right,well,we need to charge our batteries.
All right.
Looks like you got it covered.
Where you going ?
Home.
You take a shower ?
Nothing gets past you.
Go clean the tub and fill it up.
Why ?
The water doesn't get to that shower by magic.
If the power goes out again,
so do the pumps that get it there.
So we store what we can.
That is why.
she is your daughter,rob,not your employee.
Well.
she needs to talk less and listen more.
You need to learn to ease up on her.
Darcy.
I don't know how long I'll be here,so whatever
i gotta teach her,it needs to happen now.
you know,when we find out what's going on,
are you gonna stay or leave ?
Don't think about that yet.
Well,I can't help it.
I finally have you back.
you were always good at blocking out the bad.
Dad,not so much.
He's had more to block out.
When you left,you left quite a mess.
You have no idea of the lengths
you father went to to square things.
Then why didn't he talk to me ?
Because he knew you'd resent it.
And there's a stubborn streak
that runs in the family.
Honey.
I think you owe him the truth.
You want me to tell him about my.
about my time away ?
This house is too small for big secrets.
what was that ?
It's a power spike.
Boys.
wow,looks like business as usual.
How'd you get your kids back so quick ?
Always lead with recess.
Emily: Got to get things back to normal.
Whatever that is.
Go ! Go ! Go !
Hurry,hurry !
emily ?
Emily.
emily ?
Emily ?
Oh,my god.
Emily,wake up.
Emily,wake up.
Uh,everybody.
do you remember the emergency
drills we did at school ?
okay.
Go find your buddy and go sit behind the fence.
One,two,three,go !
Come on,quickly.
Go.
Is she going to wake up ?
Yes.
With super powers ?
Probably not.
Now,go. Go !
Go,lucas,go !
Come on,emily,come on.
Wake up.
Wonder when they're going to come.
You really can't wait to fly this coop,huh ?
Are you still going to file that
irs report on my farm ?
That's not exactly my first order of business,
but it is the reason I fell into this godforsaken
hell hole in the first place.
So is that a yes,no or maybe ?
It's an eventually.
Look,if it were up to me,I'd see what I could do.
But that's probably justthe
irish coffee talking.
You got a family back home ?
I have fish.
I'm sure they really miss you.
I wonder what that's about.
Mary,keep my tab open,will ya ?
Your tab,stanley ?
Yeah,and keep the irish coffees coming.
Till I get my farm back at least.
You heard the hillbilly.
Keep 'em coming.
enter id
okay,let's board her. Get an I. V. Started
and get some o2 on her.
Keep an eye on the pulse and let me
know if her bp drops.
We got to keep an eye on her.
Where's ashlee ?
She went to get alice.
Alice ?
Alice in wonderland ?
Inside ?

Ashlee !
Ashlee ?
Honey ?
Ashlee,honey.
Ashlee,it's ms. Lisinski.
Ashlee !
Ashlee !
Chief,we've got another blaze over
on the south side. Over.
Copy that.
We've got a second fire.
It's south side near the trailer park.
But we don't have enough guys to fight this one.
They'll come back as soon as they can.
Take the second truck.
Move !
truck 77,let's get a ladder up there.
what happened ?
Looks like she got hit with a lot of voltage.
Go ahead,lock it in !
How'd it start ?
Power lines.
Power lines ?
Hold the water.
What's wrong ?
Electrical fire.
Spray water on electricity everybody
it touches gets fried.
Johnston.
I thought you were at the ranch.
The horses are safe.
What about the stables ?
There's nothing but dirt around for miles.
They're fine.
You are not going to that fire.
I let chief carrol and half
the department go to denver.
We're down to a handful of men.
Who can handle it.
Johnston,if you get any sicker than you already
are,you're not going to be any use to anybody.
Dad,dad,are you still there ?
Yeah,eric,I'm on my way.
No,no,no,no,go downstairs and turn off
the power grid to the library.
Give me five minutes.
Looks like you get your way.
They can use me here.
Good.
The power should be cut in five minutes.
Get your men in position.
Cover one-seven four blocks east of maple.
Uh,one call. Stand by.
What are you doing ?
Making sure she didn't have a heart attack.
you're in good hands.
Power's down. You're good to go.
Copy.
All right,that's it,power's down.
Okay,open them up.
They're on.
Okay.
What's going on ?
We lost pressure.
Oh,my god.
Pumping station must be on the same power grid as us.
When we lost power to one.we cut into both.
Where's the pumping station ?
Up the hill at the end of chaparral.
Unhook those hoses.
See if there's a working hydrant around back.
Right,chief.
hey,jake.
Stanley.
Thank god.
Chaparral,pumping station,let's go.
Heather.
where's what ?
Heather ? Where's heather ?
Eric.
Yeah ?
I think heather might still be inside.
Nah,they said they cleared the building.
Are you sure ?
Ventilate that areA.
Eric,what are you doing ?
Eric,no !
I wonder what lindsay lohan is doing right now.
Do you think she's still alive ?
I'm trying to find my parents,lisa. I could care less.
Great.
My battery's almost dead.
Excuse me,sorry.
Do you guys sell phone chargers ?
Um,what kind of phone ?
I'll check the back.
Thanks.
Why do you like that freak ?
Why do you like stupid,bulimic actresses ?
Whoa,incoming.
Whoa,sean,no skateboards.
Read the sign.
Hey,you guys got to check it out.
The library's burning,and I didn't even do it.
Is anyone hurt ?
Probably.
Sky,let's go.
Go ahead,I'll catch up.
Come on.
This one says universal,so it should work.
Um,we were going to go check out the fire.
If you want to.
Dale.
Make sure our extinguishers are working,will ya ?
I should stay.
But if you want,I could charge
it and you could come back.
Okay.
Um,if my parents call.
I'll find you.
Thanks.
Come on,if we can open the valve,
we can get water to the fire.
valve shutoff inside
Ashlee ?
hey,ashlee.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go. Come on.
Is anyone here ?
Heather ?
Come oN.
Hey,come on,let's go.
Better do what the angry fireman says.
Let's go.
Come on,this way,let's go !
damn.
it's not going to budge.
Thanks,stanley how do you even know this is it ?
Trust me,it's the manual override.
When the power spiked the solenoid
valves shut down in the off position.
What ?
Dude,you're freaking me out.
How do you even know that ?
How do you not ?
Looks like nobody's touched it in years.
Nobody has.
The motor opens and closes it when the power's on.
No power,no motor.
Yeah,and no water.
Of course,right now what we really need is leverage.
You know what ?
Wait right here.
you can't go in there,ma'am.
My husband's in there !
Stand back,please.
Ashlee,we're going to go out another way.
Are you okay ?
What's wrong ?
nothing,nothing.
We just got to use the other door.
No,no,this way's blocked.
Smoke !
We got to stop it.
Okay,okay,uh,can we use this ?
Yeah.
okay,honey,I need you to get down and
try not to breathe the smoke,all right ?
It's all going to be okay,ashlee.
It's going to be okay.
eric ?
We need another snake.
Ashlee,I need you to crunch down here,
like a game of leap frog,okay ?
Ready ?
this is gonna help protect you.
This'll protect you and help you breathe.
Here.
Here.
Here,breathe using this.
got it !
We got it !
it's running,it's running. We got water.
we're gonna be okay.
Come on,this is our chance. Let's get the hell out of here !
Come on,let's go !
come on.
Somebody has to go in there and help them !
Ma'am,stay back,please.
oh,my god.
Are you hurt ?
No,don't worry about me.
The little girl,she got a lot of smoke.
April,can you take her ?
All right,yeah.
You're gonna be okay,ashlee.
Give me the scope.
I want to see if they have water down at the library.
Listen.
this scope was a christmas present,okay ?
Relax.
Careful.
what do you see ?
It working.
They've got water at the library.
What about the south side fire ?
Looks like the fire's out down by the trailer park.
There's a lot of smoke.
There's another fire.
It's in the east woods.
What ?  !
It's right near eric's house.
What the hell ?
What is it,jake ? What's going on ?
april,april !
Eric,eric,there's another fire.
We'll get to it as soon as we can.
We need help clearing the alley.
Eric.
The fire's spreading.
Eric,it's heading to your house !
What do you want to do ?
It's heading to your house.
There's nothing to do.
We're already spread too thin.
If we don't stop the fire,it could take out main street.
April ?
he's right.
hardware
What are you planning to do ?
Put out a fire.
Do you need a hand ?
I'm good.
If I knew anything,I would tell your mayor.
What do you know ?
Not much.
I got the same message as everyone else.
Do you want my help ?
Get in.
first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to D. C.
Is burn these clothes.
So,what's on your agenda once things settle ?
No agenda.
Just looking forward to living my life.
With dudley do wrong ?
Never gonna happen.
That's really none of your business.
Besides.
you don't know eric the way I do.
Mercifully.
But I know his kind.
Guys like that don't leave wives for girls like us.
"Girls like us" ?
I've been around this particular block before.
Well,I'm sorry to blow your theory,but.
eric is telling his wife about us tonight.
Is he now ?
Yes,he is.
Well,never mind,then.
To the happy couple.
get up a littlehigher by that chimney.
Hey,we got it !
We got it ! Save your house !
What now ?
Water.
Let's use the pool pump.
Filter system.
That's pretty smart,jake.
So where'd you learn to do all this ?
I was a pool guy.
turn it on !
Turn it on !
what ?
Turn on the pump !
Hawkins !
Hawkins !
Come on.
What the hell are you doing ?
Fire knocked out the power.
so I found my own.
got it ?
That was quick thinking.
Yeah,I was a pool guy,too.
How you doing,ashlee ?
I'm okay.
Minor smoke inhalation,but she's gonna be okay.
You saved her life.
Are the other fires still going ?
The south side's under control.
The one near your house ?
I haven't heard. My wife.
hey,where's april ?
You're still here.
Yeah.
Did my parents.
sorry.
It's charged,though.
You going home now ?
Are you gonna stay here all night ?
Don't have anywhere else to go.
The fire moved through the trailer park.
It's all gone.
Oh,dale,I am so sorry.
It's okay.
No,it's not.
Why are you being so calm about it ?
Don't have much of a choice.
How 'bout,scream ?
Cry. Hit something. Break something.
Come on.
Where are you going ?
We'll start with the mayor.
We'll get him to give you a place
to live and some clothes and some money.
I can take care of myself. I'll be okay.
I was just trying to help.
I know.
I know.
here,let me help you with that.
I got it.
No.
I told you.
I'm sorry.
petition for dissolution of marriage
Divorce papers ?
I had them drawn up before the bombs went off.
I didn't want you to see them.
I don'T.
I don't want that anymore.
The divorce,I don't want it.
Well,I can't blame you,april.
Things have been bad between us for a long time.
Not bad.
Just.
not good.
Not now.
Everything's changed,eric.
The world has changed.
Please.
We can think about this.
Just.
not today.
The good silver.
What's the occasion ?
Oh,this set's been passed down for five generations.
Probably seen the light of day maybe
half a dozen times since I've had it.
From now on,every night's a special occasion.
Did you turn off the tv ?
Yeah.
Seemed kind of silly to be staring at a blank screen,
waiting for god-knows-who to tell me god-knows-what.
It did get me thinking,though.
You know that.
that thing you've been running away from ?
It's not out there.
He's upstairs,waiting on dinner.
hi.
I'm glad you're home.
Come on.
Last call,folks !
Closing early tonight !
What are we gonna do about this ?
Watch it at home.
Or at a friend'S.
last.call.
Stanley,go tell everyone.
But I want to watch.
Then pay your tab.
Okay,I'm going.
Check it out,check it out.
It's something else every day.
How are we going to handle all this ?
Same way we did today.
We lost a few buildings but no lives.
And that is,in no small part,thanks to you.
A lot of folks are saying how lucky
jericho is to have you back again.
And what are you telling them ?
Well,I've tried to correct them,but nobody listens to me.
you know what the hardest part
about growing up your son was ?
It's not the politics,or the expectations,it'S.
it's that I always knew you were a good judge
of character,and you thought mine was lousy.
When I left town,I was determined
to prove you wrong,but.
but instead,everywhere I went,
I seemed to prove you right.
Dad.
I wasn't just in san diego.
I don't care.
What ?
I don't care.
If you need to tell me,I'll listen,but.
wherever you went,whatever you did,it changed you.
And a stupid little punk may have left home,
but a pretty decent fellow came back.
I can live with that.

daddy,now that the electricity
is back on,can we go to the movies ?
Of course.
And baseball games,and the aquarium,and.
let's just.
start with a movie,okay ?
Okay.
Why were you working outside today ?
Daddy had to fix something.
What was in that big box ?
That was my tools.
Come on,sam,it's bedtime.
Will you come tuck me in,dad ?
Okay.
Did you fix the problem ?
daddy's working on it.
After all these years,wanting to have the whole family around the table.
careful what you wish for.
it's delicious,gail.
Thanks.
Yeah,who knew instant potatoes could taste like anything ?
Well,things will get better after we get real food.
Filet mignon with bleu cheesE.
Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.
Cheeseburger and french fries.
Corned beef and cabbage with that spicy mustard.
Yeah,I could go for a slice of mom's blueberry pie.
Fried chicken with some fresh corn on the cob.
Chocolate cake.
excuse me.they're getting a feed at bailey'S.
Let's turn on the tv.
No,they're the only ones picking it up.
I think it's a satellite feed from D. C.
You're coming,aren't you ?
Yeah,of course.
keep moving it; we lost the picture.
What's going on ?
All right,everybody calm down,all right ?
We'll have it back in a second.

O: All right,it looks like the explosion came from the west,maybe denver.
If it was an attack and there's chaos out there
you might not want the wrong people knowing that jericho is still here.
Johnston: The unfortunate truth is,there was another explosion in atlanta.
So,do we have a plan?
I will talk to april.
Tonight.
Secrets of a small town.
Divorce papers.
I had them drawn up before the bombs went off.
I don't want it.
The train that never showed up-- smashed into a car.
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.
If I knew anything I would tell your mayor.
hello.
This assistant secretary walsh from the department of homeland security.
Stay where you are.
Do not attempt to leave.
what's going on?
All right,everybody calm down,all right?
We'll have it back in a second.
are those ours or theirs?
They're headed up.
They must be ours.
Nearest missile silo's in wyoming,100 miles away.
So this is it?
We're at war?

Dad?
Hey,I want you to get your mom and samuel down here,and you wait for me until I come out.
What are you...
no,now,baby,now.
Well,if we're sending missiles,they must have figured out who attacked us.
God bless america.
Could have just decided to take out one of the usual suspects.
Which means there could be more missiles headed in our direction.
Well,is this the federal response we've all been waiting for?
end transmission
robert,the circuit breaker wasn't the breaker.
It was an emp.
It's an electromagnetic pulse.
Fries anything with a circuit board.
That means all electronics,appliances,anything with wires.
Does that mean another bomb has gone off somewhere?
What the hell was that?
Jake: It was an emp.
Everything's dead.
Well,is help on its way or not?
I don't think so.

oh,dude!
Slow down.
What's the matter with you,huh?
Dale,hey,whoa,whoa,whoa.
What are you doing?
He broke our window,you saw him.
Dale.
Thanks a lot.
Dale,hold up.
What?
You all right?
They tried to break into the store twice this week.
Oh,that's terrible.
You got a problem?
Not me.
Dale's my buddy.
Right,dale?
You can't go around shoving people in the street,all right?
If you got a problem,you take it up with jimmy or bill.
All they'll do is write a report.
All right,well,then,come to me.
I can take care of myself.
There's got to be an easier way.
Maybe we can rig up the washing machine to work with the hand crank or something?
I'll be back tonight.
Where are you going,dad?
To the station.
So why you heading off to play cop?
Because people are starting to react to the fact that no one is coming to save them.
Okay?No one.
Because the world we knew does not exist anymore.
So if we can't keep order,we will not survivE.
Alison,give me a minute with your father.
Mom,I just...
now.
What the hell are you doing scaring our kids about the end of the world,robert?
Well,they have to understand what's going on.
You haven't been around for four years.
I'm the parent here,okay?
I'll decide what they need.
We cannot have photos up.
They might raise questions about us as a family.
I'm not in this.
Get rid of them,darcy.
People are trespassing on my land.
Well,we don't have the resources to control the whole town,carla.
You have to keep an eye on your own properties.
Our street's got a busted water main.My whole front lawn is flooded.
I'm trying to get some men on that right now.
Where's mayor green?
He is home recuperating from the flu.
Then who's running this town?
The mayor is still in charge,and,you know,these guys are doing the best job they can with a short staff.
Who the hell are you?
He is a volunteer and a deputy.
Now settle down and we'll get to you.
But you have to be patient.
Please.
Mary: How's your brother?
Eric pretty much keeps to himself.
Spends a lot of time at work making sure the town stays on its feet.
Really?
That's odd.
I just figured he'd be spending a little more time with his wife.
You know,now that they've lost the house and all.
They seem pretty happy together.
Man: Mitchell,wait up.
Looking good,mary.
We are not doing this again,mitch.
You're not welcome here.
Oh,come on,with everything that's happened,I'm just looking for a cold beer.
Well,we haven't served cold anything in a long time.
All right,just give me whatever you got.
Or I'll get it myself.
You might want to rethink that.
Everyone thought you went up in the blast.
But I knew you'd find a way to survive.
Oh,come on,let's not do it like this.
Besides,anyone should have a grudge,it's me,right?
I mean,you left me holding the bad when you blew town.
You know what,you're right.
Don't make me kick your ass again.
Robert: HeY.
Is everything all right?
You travel with your own personal bodyguard now?
That's probably not a bad idea.
Robert: What's the trouble here?
Oh,no trouble.
We're just two old friends catching up.
Well,maybe you should do that some other place.
And some other time.
See you soon.
Hey,mom.
Hi.
What are you doing home?
I'm just snagging another citation ledger.
Taken more complaints these last few days than we normally do in a month.
Well,jake and I are going out to the ranch to feed the horses in a little bit.
If you'd like to join us,maybe we could talk.
I'm sorry,I can'T.
With dad down,I'm struggling just to make sure things don't fall apart out there.
How 'bout things closer to home?
What's that supposed to mean?
How are you and april doing?
Why,did she say something?
Eric...
how's johnston?
I wish I had better news.
His fever's getting worse.
I'll try to dig up a stronger course of antibiotics at the med center,but we're running low on supplies.
God,if I could just get him to ear something.
Can you stay?
Don't worry about me,mom.
There's a box protein bars at the station.I'll just grab one of those.
Okay.
If you wait ten minutes,maybe we could walk together?
I got to go.
There's an important meeting.
Then that's where you should be.
We'll talk tonight.
Maybe we can put in a new starter.
No one can find a starter that works.
uncle sam!
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Can you please not call me that?
what did she say?
Oh,she says she likes your shoes.
Thank you.
I have a proposition.
The hotel I was staying in closed,and since you owe the government more than...$180,000...
no one's heard from the government in weeks.
Consider me the government.
Fine,then I still get to call you uncle sam.
Nice watch.
It's a rolex.
You got the time?
It's,um...
it just stopped working after the pulse,just like everyone else'S.
Well,I how about I pay you when it starts up again?
You're being an idiot.
I am trying to give you a chance to protect your interests.
You're too kind.
Hey,here's the deal.
You let me stay here,and I will deduct my room and board from what you owe the irs.
Fine,fine,why not?
I can use an extra field hand,and you can help bonnie with the cooking and the washing.
Okay,maybe you don't understand the nature of a deal.
I don't do housework.
Is that a cockroach?
We don't have cockroaches here.
Well,it landed right on me!
It's probably attracted to all that chicken crap in the yard.
Stanley,what's wrong?
What do you got there?
Rap sheet on mitchell cafferty.
Armed robbery,assault,gun-trafficking.
Yeah.
Mitch isn't one of jericho's finest.
What do you know about him?
Well,he hasn't given us trouble in a while.
He stays on the edge of town in a sort of compound with a bunch of guys.
Like survivalists?
I guess.
Why are you so interested?
Well,he was in bailey's this morning.
Had some words with your brother.
Looked like there was a bit of history there.
What did jake do about it?
Kept his cool,didn't engage.
Well,it's best we leave it alone,then.
Like you said,it's history.
Well,one thing that hasn't changed...
all this.
You remember when you first started riding?
Took to it like a fish to water.
You know,if you'd favored your father a little less and your dinky uncle dennis a little more,you would've been a hell of a jockey.
Talk to me.
I'm tired of hearing my own voice.
You okay?
Yeah,just tired.
I'm gonna get the water.
mom!Stay down!
Who are those guys?
xxxxxxxxx
I'll get you some aspirin for the pain and swelling.
I'm sorry I can't offer anything stronger.
I-it's okay,honey.
I don't need anything else.
Don't argue with her,gail-- doctor's orders.
Damn bastards.
Jake?
Where are you going?
To find mitch.
And then what?
I don't know yet.
Well,hold on,jake,you don't know for sure if he's behind this.
It was him.
You said yourself you didn't get a good look.
Now,look...
you know,I would like nothing better than to string up the guys who did this,but that's not the way we do things.
Last time you got mixed up with mitch cafferty,you left town and a boy was dead.
I'm not that guy anymore.Yeah?
Let's just make sure that it stays that way.
Look,if I don't care of him,he'll come back.
We've got to do this right.
You know that...
if this family starts breaking the law,how are we supposed to enforce it?
Gracie,you still have those crop pesticides?
Everything I got left is right there on that shelf.
Thank god.I'm gonna need everything you got to protect my corn.
Can anyone even eat that corn?
What about that rain we had?
No,it's okay.
The husks kept it safe from the fallout.
It was already mature,so the ears didn't take up any of that moisture.
You sure about that?
Gracie,you think I'd let my sister eat it if I didn't ink it was safe?
You think i would?
After what I've been exposed to?
I'll give you 20 bushels for those pesticides.
Well,I was thinking we'd split the harvest,half and half.
Half?
What are you,crazy?
Well,how you gonna sell your corn?
Give it to me,I'll sell it here,and we'll share the profit.
Mimi: Richmond farm belongs to the U.S.Treasury.
You're lucky we just don't commandeer what we need.
I'd like to see you try.
All right,let's go.
Hey,jimmy.
Eric,what's up?
Hey,mary.
Where the hell have you been?
We think mitch cafferty and his cohorts stole some horses.
I know they were here earlier; I thought maybe you might have heard something.
Anything you might know,mary,would really help.
There was a man here this afternoon.
I heard him say that he bought a horse from some guys out at the airfield.
The airfield.
All right.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Eric.
The last time I saw you,you were gonna tell your wife about us and we were gonna start our life together.
That thought has kept me going.
That was nearly two weeks ago.
I don't know...
what you're thinking,I don't know if you're okay.
I don't know if I'm okay,mary.
I know this is not what I wanted.
Mary,I think about you every minute of every day.
Man,I wake up in the morning,and I want it to be you there so badly.
I know I...
I'm still married,and I have a wife,and I owe her...
something.
I don't know what to say,mary.
I wish I did,but I don'T.
It's like a damn infirmary in here.
Thought it'd be at least 20 years before it came to this.
I'm hot!
I'll bet you didn't expect a house full of kids,either.
I'm worried about jake.
So am I.
I don't think I'll ever forget the night I got that call.
Went out there and saw that mitch cafferty in handcuffs,that other kid all covered in blood,and all I could think is...
one of those boys could've been jake.
oh,hi,stanley.
Hi.
Sorry to bother you,mrs.Green,mayor,but I,uh...
I need to talk to you.
What is it?
I found corn worms in my crop...
and I know this is a long shot,but I was hoping maybe you'd have some pesticides out at your ranch.
None of the other farms can spare 'em.
Sorry,stanley.Have you tried gracie's?
Yeah.She-she won't give 'em up.
You see,I need to kill these bugs,or I'd have to harvest what's good today,or it's-it's all gone.
Does she realize you have the biggest farm in jericho?
I mean,if we lose his crops,we all starve.
We're just gonna have to put together a crew as quick as we can,and we'll have to figure out how to ration it.
Stanley: Hang on a minute.
This is my corn.
Well,of course it is,stanley-- it's just right now we need you to share.
I mean,we're on our own here,and the town's nearly out of food.
Well,now,I'm willing to do my part,mayor,but I'm not giving up my crop.
Stanley,there'll be plenty enough for you and bonnie.
Plenty enough for everyone.
For 5,000 people plus livestock for god knows how many months?
I am not the only farm in this town.Why am I being targeted?
Stanley,nobody's being targeted.
It sure doesn't seem that way,sir-- all of a sudden everybody's laying claim to my crop-- the irs,gracie,and now you.
Stanley,we're just...
all due respect,I'll take care of it myself.
Oh,stanley,come and sit down,honey.
Stanley,come on back here,now.
hey,girl.
Jake.
Dale,what are you doing here?
I'm so sorry.I didn't know.
Didn't know what?
Jake!
jake?
You back away.
Get the hell out of here,dale.
No.
Stick around-- think of this as initiation.
You've crossed the line.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Coming to our family's ranch.
I crossed the line?
I went to jail...
that night that you bailed on us.
My best friend...
had half of his head blown off.
I told you I wasn't gonna rob anybody.
Oh,come on,stop acting like an angel.
You come back to...settle down?
Raise a family,maybe do a little farming?
I never planned on staying.
Of course not.
But where you gonna go?
Cars don't work.
We're fresh out of horses.
Jake: If you...
or anybody ever come near my family again,I will kill you.
Now,that's the jake I know.
All right,now get uP.
I'm taking you to go see john.
stop!Sheriff!
Don't even move.
Where's mitchell?
Don't know.
I know you,sean.You're lying.
Dale?
You're next.
What am I gonna do about this?
Can't charge them with anything and the nearest judge is in the county seat and we don't even know if that exists anymore.
Is this about these kids?
Or mitchell cafferty?
He stole my mother's horses and he could have gotten her killed.
Oh,you had run-ins with this guy long before that,jake.
I've read his file.
He's gonna be a problem,right?
And now with the sheriff and half our deputies dead,mitchell and his kind are gonna prey on this town like locusts.
We need to stop them now.
Well,if it's information you want,first thing we do is separate them.
All right,I'll take sean into the hallway.
No.
I'll do it.
Get up.We're going for a walk.
Screw that,I don't have to...
Walk.
Some pesticides got stolen over at gracie'S.
Do you know anything about it?
No.I mean,I was there earlier trying to buy some,but...
but what?
All right.What's going on?Why are you acting like this?
Gracie came down to the station.
Started raising all kinds of hell.
She says you stole 'em.
She told you I stole them?
You mind if I take a look around?
Yeah,I do,bill.This is nuts!
What's going on?
I don't know.
One of my best friends is accusing me of stealing pesticides.
I'm gonna check the barn.
I didn't say you could go in there.
Watch it.
It's okay.Just let him do what he wants to do.
Fine,check the barn.
Check the whole damn house!
How you got mixed up with mitchell but you need to stay away from him.
I'm serious.You can wind up in jail or a lot worse.
How did you get mixed up with him?
I was stupid.
And bored and looking for trouble.
Are you looking for trouble?
Dale.
Why are they keeping you here?What'd you do?
I'm just talking to him.
You can't without an attorney.
I'm not a cop.
I'm bailing him out anyway.
I know the machines are down,but you have to take it.
Get out of here.
You're letting me go?
Jake: Yeah.
Just trying to talk some sense into you.
Believe me,you don't want to go down this road.
I think I know where mitchell is.
I'll show you.
dad?
Dad?
dad?
Come on,out of here.
Are all those cities gone?
What do you think?
How do you know?
I don't for sure.
Okay.
Those are the cities I heard about through the ham radio,and the satellite feed before the emp.
Home come your laptop wasn't fried like everything else?
It's ruggedized.
It is built to withstand an emp.
The,um...
the government issues them,baby.
So you're some kind of spy?
That's why you moved us here.
You knew this was gonna happen.
Why do you have that gun?What's it for?
Shooting.
And I think it's probably time you learned how.
You see,the way things are going...
you may have to defend yourself one day.
Do you understand?
Hey,what's going on?
We were just catching up.
Right?
You're clear.
Are you sure?
Because we can check the fields.We can go through them row by row.
We got a complaint.
So all you gotta do now is accuse someone?
Stanley.
No.
What about my word,bill?
I'm just doing my job,man.
Mimi: What are you doing?
I'm gonna burn the field.
You've completely lost your mind.What happened to you?
I'm not gonna burn the whole field,just the infested partS.
Oh,my god,stanley.
You don't need to do this.
Look,it's the only thing I can think of.
I got the pesticides.
What are you talking about?
I paid some kids to steal them from gracie's store.
We just have to get into town and pick them up.
You stole the pesticides?
What,am I talking to myself?
I paid someone to steal them.
I gave them my diamond watch.
I can't believe this is what we've come to.
We don't really have a choice,stanley.
It's every man for himself now.
He's finally asleep.
Great.
How are you feeling?
I'm hanging in there.
I'm sorry there isn't more I can do for him.
That's one obstinate guy in there.
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Certainly not as far as jake's concerned.
I don't know as I've ever really thought of eric as being stubborn.
Hard to reach,then?
Well,he's had a lot on his plate.
Since the missiles...
not to mention your new living arrangement.
Yeah.
It started long before all of this.
I've been where you are.
Putting something back together...
isn't ever easy.
But somebody's got to take the first step.
Now,if you want to fight for this thing,start fighting.
You need to be smarter about who you hang out with.
I don't hang out with those guys.
I needed sean and mitch to help me move some stuff,that's all.
I didn't know about the horses.
Well,what did you think,dale?
Hey,you never should have tried to protect them.
I wasn'T.I was trying to protect gracie.
What do you mean?
A train crashed full of food supplies.
It's how I've been keeping gracie stocked.
I didn't want anyone to know about it.
It's all in there.
What?
This place was full.It was stacked to the rafters.
I guess we know who took it.
Gracie.
You get the hell out of my store.I know you stole from me.
No,I didn't,gracie.I swear I didn'T.
Gracie,how long have you known me?
My whole life,right?
We have to trust each other.
Just,just,let me show you.
Follow me.
You see,gracie?It's all here.
Nobody stole anything from anyone,okay?
It was a misunderstanding.
Eric: Do you have any idea where he would have moved it to?
Dale: No,no,I don'T.
You stay here.
Stop right there,mitchell!
Put your gun down.
Put your gun down!
Now put your hands up.
where's the food?
Eric: Jake...
stop.
Stop!
What are you doing?I said,"stop.
" Where's the food?
So what are we doing to do about him?
Eric: We lock him up for now.
Maybe we can send someone to fielding,see if the courthouse is still running.
His friends aren't going to let this go.
I can handle it.
Yeah,you handled it real good back at the barn.
I should have killed him.
Stop it,jake!
You're not that guy anymore.
What about these two?
Eric: Now I can see letting dale go,but sean helped steal the horses.
He's still a boy.
A boy who could have gotten you killed,mom.
Well,it doesn't matter,eric,because I'm not pressing charges.
This cell is too small to hold everybody who ever made a mistake.
What do you suggest?
Rehabilitation.
Okay.
Okay,hold it.
All fingers wrapped.
Okay,relax.
Right.
It's okay.
Breathe.
Nice.Stand with your legs like so.
A little further apart.
Right.
Now bend your knees,take your sight.
Try to keep your eyes open.
Squeeze.
Right.Good job,good job.
All right.
That's a very good job.
You like that?
are you sure this is going to work?
In theorY.
You've never done this before?
Nope.
Well,don't get it on your shoes.
Seriously,get away from me.
Oh,my god,I wish I prayed.
Gail: Stanley.
you said you needed to harvest today.
We're here to help,no strings attached.
thanks.
mom.
Well,hello.
I'm really sorry,mrs.Green.
I'm sorry for everything.
All right,well,go make yourselves useful.
forget it.
Man: Uncle sam.
You ever slept in a barn before?
You know,it's not like it is in the movies.
It can get pretty fragrant in there with all the pigs and goats brushing up against you.
You're bluffing.
Try me,please.
these are for you.
I lost my head,stanley.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
you have any idea what you're doing?
not a clue.
thanks for your help.
this is our home,too.
Right.
is he a good man or a bad man?
baby,there's no such thing.
kind of cool,huh?
Yeah.
Especially if you like corn.
Tough work,huh?
Yeah.
I was thinking maybe when we leave here,we could,uh,I was going to say go for a walk,but we'll be too tired...
april,stop,please.Okay?
What?
This.
What you're doing.
It's making things worse.
I'm just trying to talk to you,get you to look at me,something.
Well,three weeks ago,you were asking about a divorce.
Three weeks ago,we lived on a different planet.
Things have changed.
Never mind.
april,wait.
There's always the walk home.
Why don't we start there,see how we feel.
this town...
jake.
You ready for this?
You know he's going to come for me.
And then,he's going to come looking for you.
There's no running away this time,jake.

O: All right,it looks like the explosion came from the west,maybe denver.
If it was an attack and there's chaos out there
you might not want the wrong people knowing that jericho is still here.
Johnston: The unfortunate truth is,there was another explosion in atlanta.
So,do we have a plan?
I will talk to april.
Tonight.
Secrets of a small town.
Divorce papers.
I had them drawn up before the bombs went off.
I don't want it.
The train that never showed up-- smashed into a car.
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.
If I knew anything I would tell your mayor.
hello.
This assistant secretary walsh from the department of homeland security.
Stay where you are.
Do not attempt to leave.
what's going on?
All right,everybody calm down,all right?
We'll have it back in a second.
are those ours or theirs?
They're headed up.
They must be ours.
Nearest missile silo's in wyoming,100 miles away.
So this is it?
We're at war?
enter psw
what's the target?
ours ot theirs
i'm compromised
Dad?
Hey,I want you to get your mom and samuel down here,and you wait for me until I come out.
What are you...
no,now,baby,now.
Well,if we're sending missiles,they must have figured out who attacked us.
God bless america.
Could have just decided to take out one of the usual suspects.
Which means there could be more missiles headed in our direction.
Well,is this the federal response we've all been waiting for?
end transmission
robert,the circuit breaker wasn't the breaker.
It was an emp.
It's an electromagnetic pulse.
Fries anything with a circuit board.
That means all electronics,appliances,anything with wires.
Does that mean another bomb has gone off somewhere?
What the hell was that?
Jake: It was an emp.
Everything's dead.
Well,is help on its way or not?
I don't think so.

2 weeks later
oh,dude!
Slow down.
What's the matter with you,huh?
Dale,hey,whoa,whoa,whoa.
What are you doing?
He broke our window,you saw him.
Dale.
Thanks a lot.
Dale,hold up.
What?
You all right?
They tried to break into the store twice this week.
Oh,that's terrible.
You got a problem?
Not me.
Dale's my buddy.
Right,dale?
You can't go around shoving people in the street,all right?
If you got a problem,you take it up with jimmy or bill.
All they'll do is write a report.
All right,well,then,come to me.
I can take care of myself.
There's got to be an easier way.
Maybe we can rig up the washing machine to work with the hand crank or something?
I'll be back tonight.
Where are you going,dad?
To the station.
So why you heading off to play cop?
Because people are starting to react to the fact that no one is coming to save them.
Okay?No one.
Because the world we knew does not exist anymore.
So if we can't keep order,we will not survivE.
Alison,give me a minute with your father.
Mom,I just...
now.
What the hell are you doing scaring our kids about the end of the world,robert?
Well,they have to understand what's going on.
You haven't been around for four years.
I'm the parent here,okay?
I'll decide what they need.
We cannot have photos up.
They might raise questions about us as a family.
I'm not in this.
Get rid of them,darcy.
People are trespassing on my land.
Well,we don't have the resources to control the whole town,carla.
You have to keep an eye on your own properties.
Our street's got a busted water main.My whole front lawn is flooded.
I'm trying to get some men on that right now.
Where's mayor green?
He is home recuperating from the flu.
Then who's running this town?
The mayor is still in charge,and,you know,these guys are doing the best job they can with a short staff.
Who the hell are you?
He is a volunteer and a deputy.
Now settle down and we'll get to you.
But you have to be patient.
Please.
Mary: How's your brother?
Eric pretty much keeps to himself.
Spends a lot of time at work making sure the town stays on its feet.
Really?
That's odd.
I just figured he'd be spending a little more time with his wife.
You know,now that they've lost the house and all.
They seem pretty happy together.
Man: Mitchell,wait up.
Looking good,mary.
We are not doing this again,mitch.
You're not welcome here.
Oh,come on,with everything that's happened,I'm just looking for a cold beer.
Well,we haven't served cold anything in a long time.
All right,just give me whatever you got.
Or I'll get it myself.
You might want to rethink that.
Everyone thought you went up in the blast.
But I knew you'd find a way to survive.
Oh,come on,let's not do it like this.
Besides,anyone should have a grudge,it's me,right?
I mean,you left me holding the bad when you blew town.
You know what,you're right.
Don't make me kick your ass again.
Robert: HeY.
Is everything all right?
You travel with your own personal bodyguard now?
That's probably not a bad idea.
Robert: What's the trouble here?
Oh,no trouble.
We're just two old friends catching up.
Well,maybe you should do that some other place.
And some other time.
See you soon.
Hey,mom.
Hi.
What are you doing home?
I'm just snagging another citation ledger.
Taken more complaints these last few days than we normally do in a month.
Well,jake and I are going out to the ranch to feed the horses in a little bit.
If you'd like to join us,maybe we could talk.
I'm sorry,I can'T.
With dad down,I'm struggling just to make sure things don't fall apart out there.
How 'bout things closer to home?
What's that supposed to mean?
How are you and april doing?
Why,did she say something?
Eric...
how's johnston?
I wish I had better news.
His fever's getting worse.
I'll try to dig up a stronger course of antibiotics at the med center,but we're running low on supplies.
God,if I could just get him to ear something.
Can you stay?
Don't worry about me,mom.
There's a box protein bars at the station.I'll just grab one of those.
Okay.
If you wait ten minutes,maybe we could walk together?
I got to go.
There's an important meeting.
Then that's where you should be.
We'll talk tonight.
Maybe we can put in a new starter.
No one can find a starter that works.
uncle sam!
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Can you please not call me that?
what did she say?
Oh,she says she likes your shoes.
Thank you.
I have a proposition.
The hotel I was staying in closed,and since you owe the government more than...$180,000...
no one's heard from the government in weeks.
Consider me the government.
Fine,then I still get to call you uncle sam.
Nice watch.
It's a rolex.
You got the time?
It's,um...
it just stopped working after the pulse,just like everyone else'S.
Well,I how about I pay you when it starts up again?
You're being an idiot.
I am trying to give you a chance to protect your interests.
You're too kind.
Hey,here's the deal.
You let me stay here,and I will deduct my room and board from what you owe the irs.
Fine,fine,why not?
I can use an extra field hand,and you can help bonnie with the cooking and the washing.
Okay,maybe you don't understand the nature of a deal.
I don't do housework.
Is that a cockroach?
We don't have cockroaches here.
Well,it landed right on me!
It's probably attracted to all that chicken crap in the yard.
Stanley,what's wrong?
What do you got there?
Rap sheet on mitchell cafferty.
Armed robbery,assault,gun-trafficking.
Yeah.
Mitch isn't one of jericho's finest.
What do you know about him?
Well,he hasn't given us trouble in a while.
He stays on the edge of town in a sort of compound with a bunch of guys.
Like survivalists?
I guess.
Why are you so interested?
Well,he was in bailey's this morning.
Had some words with your brother.
Looked like there was a bit of history there.
What did jake do about it?
Kept his cool,didn't engage.
Well,it's best we leave it alone,then.
Like you said,it's history.
Well,one thing that hasn't changed...
all this.
You remember when you first started riding?
Took to it like a fish to water.
You know,if you'd favored your father a little less and your dinky uncle dennis a little more,you would've been a hell of a jockey.
Talk to me.
I'm tired of hearing my own voice.
You okay?
Yeah,just tired.
I'm gonna get the water.
mom!Stay down!
Who are those guys?
xxxxxxxxx
I'll get you some aspirin for the pain and swelling.
I'm sorry I can't offer anything stronger.
I-it's okay,honey.
I don't need anything else.
Don't argue with her,gail-- doctor's orders.
Damn bastards.
Jake?
Where are you going?
To find mitch.
And then what?
I don't know yet.
Well,hold on,jake,you don't know for sure if he's behind this.
It was him.
You said yourself you didn't get a good look.
Now,look...
you know,I would like nothing better than to string up the guys who did this,but that's not the way we do things.
Last time you got mixed up with mitch cafferty,you left town and a boy was dead.
I'm not that guy anymore.Yeah?
Let's just make sure that it stays that way.
Look,if I don't care of him,he'll come back.
We've got to do this right.
You know that...
if this family starts breaking the law,how are we supposed to enforce it?
Gracie,you still have those crop pesticides?
Everything I got left is right there on that shelf.
Thank god.I'm gonna need everything you got to protect my corn.
Can anyone even eat that corn?
What about that rain we had?
No,it's okay.
The husks kept it safe from the fallout.
It was already mature,so the ears didn't take up any of that moisture.
You sure about that?
Gracie,you think I'd let my sister eat it if I didn't ink it was safe?
You think i would?
After what I've been exposed to?
I'll give you 20 bushels for those pesticides.
Well,I was thinking we'd split the harvest,half and half.
Half?
What are you,crazy?
Well,how you gonna sell your corn?
Give it to me,I'll sell it here,and we'll share the profit.
Mimi: Richmond farm belongs to the U.S.Treasury.
You're lucky we just don't commandeer what we need.
I'd like to see you try.
All right,let's go.
Hey,jimmy.
Eric,what's up?
Hey,mary.
Where the hell have you been?
We think mitch cafferty and his cohorts stole some horses.
I know they were here earlier; I thought maybe you might have heard something.
Anything you might know,mary,would really help.
There was a man here this afternoon.
I heard him say that he bought a horse from some guys out at the airfield.
The airfield.
All right.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Eric.
The last time I saw you,you were gonna tell your wife about us and we were gonna start our life together.
That thought has kept me going.
That was nearly two weeks ago.
I don't know...
what you're thinking,I don't know if you're okay.
I don't know if I'm okay,mary.
I know this is not what I wanted.
Mary,I think about you every minute of every day.
Man,I wake up in the morning,and I want it to be you there so badly.
I know I...
I'm still married,and I have a wife,and I owe her...
something.
I don't know what to say,mary.
I wish I did,but I don'T.
It's like a damn infirmary in here.
Thought it'd be at least 20 years before it came to this.
I'm hot!
I'll bet you didn't expect a house full of kids,either.
I'm worried about jake.
So am I.
I don't think I'll ever forget the night I got that call.
Went out there and saw that mitch cafferty in handcuffs,that other kid all covered in blood,and all I could think is...
one of those boys could've been jake.
oh,hi,stanley.
Hi.
Sorry to bother you,mrs.Green,mayor,but I,uh...
I need to talk to you.
What is it?
I found corn worms in my crop...
and I know this is a long shot,but I was hoping maybe you'd have some pesticides out at your ranch.
None of the other farms can spare 'em.
Sorry,stanley.Have you tried gracie's?
Yeah.She-she won't give 'em up.
You see,I need to kill these bugs,or I'd have to harvest what's good today,or it's-it's all gone.
Does she realize you have the biggest farm in jericho?
I mean,if we lose his crops,we all starve.
We're just gonna have to put together a crew as quick as we can,and we'll have to figure out how to ration it.
Stanley: Hang on a minute.
This is my corn.
Well,of course it is,stanley-- it's just right now we need you to share.
I mean,we're on our own here,and the town's nearly out of food.
Well,now,I'm willing to do my part,mayor,but I'm not giving up my crop.
Stanley,there'll be plenty enough for you and bonnie.
Plenty enough for everyone.
For 5,000 people plus livestock for god knows how many months?
I am not the only farm in this town.Why am I being targeted?
Stanley,nobody's being targeted.
It sure doesn't seem that way,sir-- all of a sudden everybody's laying claim to my crop-- the irs,gracie,and now you.
Stanley,we're just...
all due respect,I'll take care of it myself.
Oh,stanley,come and sit down,honey.
Stanley,come on back here,now.
hey,girl.
Jake.
Dale,what are you doing here?
I'm so sorry.I didn't know.
Didn't know what?
Jake!
jake?
You back away.
Get the hell out of here,dale.
No.
Stick around-- think of this as initiation.
You've crossed the line.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Coming to our family's ranch.
I crossed the line?
I went to jail...
that night that you bailed on us.
My best friend...
had half of his head blown off.
I told you I wasn't gonna rob anybody.
Oh,come on,stop acting like an angel.
You come back to...settle down?
Raise a family,maybe do a little farming?
I never planned on staying.
Of course not.
But where you gonna go?
Cars don't work.
We're fresh out of horses.
Jake: If you...
or anybody ever come near my family again,I will kill you.
Now,that's the jake I know.
All right,now get uP.
I'm taking you to go see john.
stop!Sheriff!
Don't even move.
Where's mitchell?
Don't know.
I know you,sean.You're lying.
Dale?
You're next.
What am I gonna do about this?
Can't charge them with anything and the nearest judge is in the county seat and we don't even know if that exists anymore.
Is this about these kids?
Or mitchell cafferty?
He stole my mother's horses and he could have gotten her killed.
Oh,you had run-ins with this guy long before that,jake.
I've read his file.
He's gonna be a problem,right?
And now with the sheriff and half our deputies dead,mitchell and his kind are gonna prey on this town like locusts.
We need to stop them now.
Well,if it's information you want,first thing we do is separate them.
All right,I'll take sean into the hallway.
No.
I'll do it.
Get up.We're going for a walk.
Screw that,I don't have to...
Walk.
Some pesticides got stolen over at gracie'S.
Do you know anything about it?
No.I mean,I was there earlier trying to buy some,but...
but what?
All right.What's going on?Why are you acting like this?
Gracie came down to the station.
Started raising all kinds of hell.
She says you stole 'em.
She told you I stole them?
You mind if I take a look around?
Yeah,I do,bill.This is nuts!
What's going on?
I don't know.
One of my best friends is accusing me of stealing pesticides.
I'm gonna check the barn.
I didn't say you could go in there.
Watch it.
It's okay.Just let him do what he wants to do.
Fine,check the barn.
Check the whole damn house!
How you got mixed up with mitchell but you need to stay away from him.
I'm serious.You can wind up in jail or a lot worse.
How did you get mixed up with him?
I was stupid.
And bored and looking for trouble.
Are you looking for trouble?
Dale.
Why are they keeping you here?What'd you do?
I'm just talking to him.
You can't without an attorney.
I'm not a cop.
I'm bailing him out anyway.
I know the machines are down,but you have to take it.
Get out of here.
You're letting me go?
Jake: Yeah.
Just trying to talk some sense into you.
Believe me,you don't want to go down this road.
I think I know where mitchell is.
I'll show you.
dad?
Dad?
dad?
Come on,out of here.
Are all those cities gone?
What do you think?
How do you know?
I don't for sure.
Okay.
Those are the cities I heard about through the ham radio,and the satellite feed before the emp.
Home come your laptop wasn't fried like everything else?
It's ruggedized.
It is built to withstand an emp.
The,um...
the government issues them,baby.
So you're some kind of spy?
That's why you moved us here.
You knew this was gonna happen.
Why do you have that gun?What's it for?
Shooting.
And I think it's probably time you learned how.
You see,the way things are going...
you may have to defend yourself one day.
Do you understand?
Hey,what's going on?
We were just catching up.
Right?
You're clear.
Are you sure?
Because we can check the fields.We can go through them row by row.
We got a complaint.
So all you gotta do now is accuse someone?
Stanley.
No.
What about my word,bill?
I'm just doing my job,man.
Mimi: What are you doing?
I'm gonna burn the field.
You've completely lost your mind.What happened to you?
I'm not gonna burn the whole field,just the infested partS.
Oh,my god,stanley.
You don't need to do this.
Look,it's the only thing I can think of.
I got the pesticides.
What are you talking about?
I paid some kids to steal them from gracie's store.
We just have to get into town and pick them up.
You stole the pesticides?
What,am I talking to myself?
I paid someone to steal them.
I gave them my diamond watch.
I can't believe this is what we've come to.
We don't really have a choice,stanley.
It's every man for himself now.
He's finally asleep.
Great.
How are you feeling?
I'm hanging in there.
I'm sorry there isn't more I can do for him.
That's one obstinate guy in there.
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Certainly not as far as jake's concerned.
I don't know as I've ever really thought of eric as being stubborn.
Hard to reach,then?
Well,he's had a lot on his plate.
Since the missiles...
not to mention your new living arrangement.
Yeah.
It started long before all of this.
I've been where you are.
Putting something back together...
isn't ever easy.
But somebody's got to take the first step.
Now,if you want to fight for this thing,start fighting.
You need to be smarter about who you hang out with.
I don't hang out with those guys.
I needed sean and mitch to help me move some stuff,that's all.
I didn't know about the horses.
Well,what did you think,dale?
Hey,you never should have tried to protect them.
I wasn'T.I was trying to protect gracie.
What do you mean?
A train crashed full of food supplies.
It's how I've been keeping gracie stocked.
I didn't want anyone to know about it.
It's all in there.
What?
This place was full.It was stacked to the rafters.
I guess we know who took it.
Gracie.
You get the hell out of my store.I know you stole from me.
No,I didn't,gracie.I swear I didn'T.
Gracie,how long have you known me?
My whole life,right?
We have to trust each other.
Just,just,let me show you.
Follow me.
You see,gracie?It's all here.
Nobody stole anything from anyone,okay?
It was a misunderstanding.
Eric: Do you have any idea where he would have moved it to?
Dale: No,no,I don'T.
You stay here.
Stop right there,mitchell!
Put your gun down.
Put your gun down!
Now put your hands up.
where's the food?
Eric: Jake...
stop.
What are you doing?I said,"stop.
" Where's the food?
Stop!
So what are we doing to do about him?
Eric: We lock him up for now.
Maybe we can send someone to fielding,see if the courthouse is still running.
His friends aren't going to let this go.
I can handle it.
Yeah,you handled it real good back at the barn.
I should have killed him.
Stop it,jake!
You're not that guy anymore.
What about these two?
Eric: Now I can see letting dale go,but sean helped steal the horses.
He's still a boy.
A boy who could have gotten you killed,mom.
Well,it doesn't matter,eric,because I'm not pressing charges.
This cell is too small to hold everybody who ever made a mistake.
What do you suggest?
Rehabilitation.
Okay.
Okay,hold it.
All fingers wrapped.
Okay,relax.
Right.
It's okay.
Breathe.
Nice.Stand with your legs like so.
A little further apart.
Right.
Now bend your knees,take your sight.
Try to keep your eyes open.
Squeeze.
Right.Good job,good job.
All right.
That's a very good job.
You like that?
are you sure this is going to work?
In theorY.
You've never done this before?
Nope.
Well,don't get it on your shoes.
Seriously,get away from me.
Oh,my god,I wish I prayed.
Gail: Stanley.
you said you needed to harvest today.
We're here to help,no strings attached.
thanks.
mom.
Well,hello.
I'm really sorry,mrs.Green.
I'm sorry for everything.
All right,well,go make yourselves useful.
forget it.
Man: Uncle sam.
You ever slept in a barn before?
You know,it's not like it is in the movies.
It can get pretty fragrant in there with all the pigs and goats brushing up against you.
You're bluffing.
Try me,please.
these are for you.
I lost my head,stanley.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
you have any idea what you're doing?
not a clue.
thanks for your help.
this is our home,too.
Right.
is he a good man or a bad man?
baby,there's no such thing.
kind of cool,huh?
Yeah.
Especially if you like corn.
Tough work,huh?
Yeah.
I was thinking maybe when we leave here,we could,uh,I was going to say go for a walk,but we'll be too tired...
april,stop,please.Okay?
What?
This.
What you're doing.
It's making things worse.
I'm just trying to talk to you,get you to look at me,something.
Well,three weeks ago,you were asking about a divorce.
Three weeks ago,we lived on a different planet.
Things have changed.
Never mind.
april,wait.
There's always the walk home.
Why don't we start there,see how we feel.
this town...
jake.
You ready for this?
You know he's going to come for me.
And then,he's going to come looking for you.
There's no running away this time,jake.

Jonah?
What's the problem, Pete?
Mitchell got arrested.
What for?
Well, we grabbed a couple horses
you know, from one of those ranches
outside of town and Mitchell got caught.
Well... Mitchell is an idiot.
But the thing is...
the ranch that we were at,
it belonged to Johnston Green.
The mayor's wife kind of got
knocked around a little bit.
Not bad, though. Nothing bad.
But... wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Who's idea was it, yours or his?
It was his.
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
I apologize.
Apology accepted.
She'll be coming 'round
the mountain when she comes
She'll be coming 'round
the mountain when she comes
- She'll be coming 'round...
- Knock it off, Mitchell.
Where's Jake?
You better go get him,
'cause when Jonah comes for me,
he's gonna want to have a little
conversation with Jake.
If he has to go looking for him
it's going to make things a whole lot worse.
Whatever.
Just keep it down in here, all right?
Better tell him to get ready.
In fact...
you all better get ready.
Right.
Mallo Cups.
- That's what they were called.
- God, I love those.
- The best.
- I always got so much more
candy than you, remember?
'Cause you cheated.
You'd trick or treat the whole
neighborhood in one costume,
then you'd go do it again in another.
Come on, Eric, everybody did that.
Well, except for you.
Jake and I had Halloween down to a science.
I was always the bag lady so I could stuff
all of his costumes into my garbage bad.
I think we hit the Stevens' house,
like, seven times in one year.
He did always share his haul with me, though.
Just like a little Bonnie and Clyde.
So adorable.
Is it inappropriate that I keep
asking questions about him?
Why would it be inappropriate?
I don't know.
Do you have a thing for Jake?
No...
- Okay, except, maybe, yes,
just a little bit. - A little.
- I'm sorry, this is really weird.
- It's not weird.
Look, it was a long time ago.
Just be careful, okay?
Why?
There's a lot of things about
Jake you don't know, okay?
Is that Jake's car?
- Oh, my God.
- What?
What is it?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Can I help... you?
- I'm here to see about posting
bail for a friend of mine.
Mitchell Cafferty.
Hello, Jonah.
Jake.
Been a long time.
5 years. So...
- I understand Mitchell's been causing some
trouble. - Come on, don't act surprised.
He doesn't get out of bed in the morning
without running it by you first.
I'm not sure that's true,
but I'm here to bail him out.
All right, then let's talk bail.
- First you're going to give back
the food you stole...
- Wait, hold on a second.
I'm not sure you've noticed,
but the world's coming apart at the seams.
What belongs to who is getting
to be a fuzzy science, Jake.
- But I'll see what I can do.
- All right, and then you're
gonna stay away from this place.
- Not just you-- Mitch, Joe Kelly...
- Since when are you in a position
to speak for this town?
- Do we have a deal?
- Shut up, Mitchell!
We have a deal.
Oh, I see you're awake.
Must be noon.
I've been up for a while.
Hey, close the front door.
What, were you born in a barn?
Were you born in a barn?
Almost a week you've been here and that
joke's really not getting any funnier.
Found some stale corn flakes in the pantry.
- Since no one else seemed to be eating
them... - Well, knock yourself out.
Here, you want a little milk with those?
There you go.
Oh...
It's still warm.
Yeah, it was even warmer when it
was in the cow ten minutes ago.
- And that will do it for the corn flakes.
- Mm...
You did that on purpose, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
- By the way, where's the funnel?
- Oh, yeah.
I put it in the random drawer.
I couldn't sleep last night, so I rearranged
some kitchen space
put all the non-essentials
out of the triangle.
- Triangle? - The workspace that
connects the three critical areas--
sink, stove and prep.
I was in the process of
having my condo in D.C.
renovated before I got stranded here.
You know, Mimi,
when I was a young boy growing up,
I always felt like there was something
missing in my life.
Now I know.
It was the triangle.
Sink, stove, prep.
We have sarcasm in D.C., you know.
These'll do, Bob.
Please tell me that's diet Cream soda.
There used to be a whole case of diet here.
Gracie promised she'd hold on to it for me.
Not to worry, dear.
I tucked it away when
we agreed on the price.
Oh, you're right.
- It's lovely.
- It's an antique.
Are you sure about this, sweetheart?
I'm sure.
Dale, there's a case of soda hidden
along the back wall next to your cot.
Would you bring it up, please?
You're still sleeping here?
Be right back.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- You were cooling your thermometer
in that glass of water, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't.
All right, so what if I was?
I'm fine. I'm tired of being babied.
You have a temperature of 350 degrees.
You are going to rest.
You are going to take
the pills that April gave you.
You are going to admire this
ridiculous pumpkin with me
and then we are going to try to eat said
pumpkin together.
Because we use every part
of the buffalo in this house.
- Is that understood?
- Most of it.
But no more meds.
It's been three weeks,
I'm not going to be the reason
this town runs clean out of antibiotics.
All right, now you listen to me.
There may come a day when this
town needs you to be a hero again
but today is not that day.
The world's changing.
Don't I know it.
Not a lot of work for a guy
hauling freight these days.
The old side business has sort of become
a full time gig.
We could use a guy like you out there.
There's a lot of stuff out on the roads
waiting for anybody to take it.
I want your word.
You and your guys are going
to stay away from town.
Already said I would.
Ask again, a guy might think
you were calling him a liar.
- And that's my car.
- Well, you left it out there.
- Yeah, but it was destroyed.
Lovingly restored.
I told you there was a lot of good stuff
out there on the roads.
This one I didn't even have to fight for.
Besides, she was mine first.
Emily...
- Why are you talking to him?
- It's okay, all right?
It didn't have anything to do with you.
He's my father.
It has everything to do with me.
You have no idea how bad
it got after you left.
He was calling.
He was everywhere.
He was coming by the house.
He wanted to talk to me.
He wanted me to forgive him
for what happened with Chris.
I will never forgive him
for what happened to Chris.
- And now you're back and he's back.
- Oh, he's not back.
All right?
After tomorrow, he's done, he's gone.
- When's it supposed to happen?
- Tomorrow morning at 11:00.
- So, we get the food back
and Prowse leaves us alone.
- Well, that's what he said.
- Yeah, we'll see what he does.
- Either way, I think it's
important that we do this.
- Okay. I'll run it by Dad.
- What's going on?
Get in here.
Gray Anderson's back in town.
- Is he okay?
- I can't believe it.
I hitched... Oh, thank you.
I hitched a ride with a...
with a supply truck that was running
bottled water to a FEMA camp
out near Rogue River.
FEMA's running.
Well, that's good, at least.
Well, about ten miles outside of
Topeka, we hit a roadblock.
I mean, nothing official, just a couple
cars rolled out onto the highway.
And as soon as we stopped, it was like...
like a dozen guys just came out of nowhere
and yanked us out of the truck.
I... fought one of them
and took off on foot.
The driver...
they just beat him to
death right on the road.
They killed him for...
just a few cases of water.
You guys have any electricity
yet, any lights or anything?
- There was a heck of a pulse.
- No.
Some simple circuits are still working
like flashlights and
electrical razors, but...
we pretty much lost everything
with a circuit board--
radio, computers,
newer cars.
- What's happening in Topeka?
- It's a mess.
Nobody knows where the hell the governor is.
And the fallout from Lawrence
hit 'em really hard.
Whoa, whoa... They... They hit Lawrence?
- Wh-Why would they hit Lawrence
and not Topeka? - I don't know.
- What about any other major cities?
New York, DC...?
- Oh, they didn't get New York.
What, New York made it?
Yeah, well, after 9/11, they got pretty good
at security and apparently,
NYPD caught three guys
right before they flipped the switch.
They had a rented van,
a 20-kiloton bomb in a steel drum.
And what about DC?
It's gone.
Hey.
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?
Mr. Anderson's back.
He says New York is still there.
New York?
- My parents?
- They might be okay.
My parents.
Hey. Took you long enough.
Your sister went to bed a little while ago.
I'm pretty sure that she still hates me.
Although tonight was the first
time she said "good night"
without the dirty sign mixed in.
I wonder if she knows that I
know what that means.
I have some bad news.
Mimi...
- What?
- Washington DC's gone.
You know, stirring them doesn't
make them taste any better.
So... Cindy Mather is dead?
If she was in DC...
then probably.
It depends how close she was
when the bomb went off.
And Joel Stafford?
He's gonna ask me out.
That's what Cindy said.
Did they feel it when they died?
- Joel... Cindy, the Thompsons
next door... - It, um...
it would've been fast.
- And Doug.
- Who's Doug?
Mom's boyfriend.
I thought you knew.
Are you out of your mind?
You made a deal with Jonah Prowse?
Yeah, Mitch for the food and
Jonah stays out of Jericho. Why?
- Because you can't make deals with
guys like that. - Wait a minute,
we talked about this. We-We agreed.
Look, I know about Prowse.
He hauled materials for Stevens
before I came into the mine.
He was stealing five percent off
the top, intimidating suppliers.
The guy did four years at Lansing for
extortion and assault.
You want to negotiate with that guy?
He's got a good point, Jake.
- What happened to clearing this with Dad?
- Look, no disrespect to your father,
but he hasn't been out there.
I've seen what happens when people
lose their hold on law and order.
You start striking bargains with the
bad guys, it's the beginning of the end.
Just calm down, all right?
We need food more than we need to keep
Mitchell Cafferty.
Now, I'm supposed to make a trade with
Jonah in an hour.
- If I go out there empty-handed, I don't
know what he's gonna do.
- It doesn't matter.
Because he'll know that we won't
roll over for him.
Look, Jake...
we either hold this territory or we don't.
Eric?
Gray's right.
I know this is only half
the soda we swapped for
- but I really need that jewelry box back.
- Oh, sorry, sweetie.
We made a deal.
I just found out my parents could be alive.
- They might be coming home at any time.
- Oh, that's good news.
I'm happy for you.
That jewelry box belonged to my mother.
Her grandmother gave it to her, it's...
it's worth a lot more than some diet soda.
I wish I could help you,
but I already traded it away.
- To who?
- All trades are confidential.
No one wants to buy a jewelry box that comes
with an argument about who it belongs to.
I'm sure that your parents will understand.
These are hard times for all of us.
Okay, fine.
Dale, um, could you lock
this up in the back, please?
- Looks like you forgot someone.
- The town said no to the deal with Mitch.
How can I fix this?
Ooh!
You scared me.
Hey, that's a good ghost.
Oh, that's for you...
No candy in here, guys.
Gray!
Gray!
Jonah's men just took Mitchell.
They're headed out the front.
Hey!
Hey!
Gray, no!
- Instead of what? Starting a
firefight on Main Street?
- I got to go out after them!
- Are you out of your mind?
- This has got to be answered, Jake.
What, are you gonna turn the other cheek?
- How long before you think these guys
are back...? - I can talk to Jonah.
- You can talk to Jonah... Find him!
He lived up to his end of the deal.
- And why the hell are you protecting
this guy? - I'm protecting this town.
- He can get things we're gonna need.
- What can he get?!
- He can get food!
He can get gas, he can get ammo.
Could you get that stuff
if we needed it tomorrow?
Could you?!
Because he can!
We'll do this my way now.
You said you could get me a car.
- Is this thing gonna die on me
halfway out there? - Charlotte?
Not a chance. She's sturdy.
- So, uh, be careful.
- I'm only going ten miles.
I meant with him.
I talked to Emily.
Yeah? What'd she tell you?
Enough.
Hey, Darcy,
Allie and Sam got a grill going outside.
I think we're barbecuing Spam.
They were asking for you.
So, uh...
I know about Doug.
- What do you know?
- I know that he's probably gone.
I know...
- I know that he meant a lot to you.
- Robby, you don't know a damn thing.
So are my kids close to him?
- Why don't you ask the kids?
- I don't want to ask the kids.
I'm ask...
Why did you come for me?
- I told you the kids...
- No, no. In D.C., you could have
just taken the kids.
We sat in traffic for two hours
that afternoon on the Beltway.
- You didn't have to wait
for me. Why'd you do it?
- Why?
- You hated me, Robert.
- I did not...
- You hated me.
You blamed me for breaking up the marriage.
And even though you left me for your work
long before I ever looked at another man.
I'll tell the kids you're
not feeling too well.
Doug and I had been dating
for about three months.
I met him at the gym.
I liked the way he looked at me.
And I liked the way that I felt
about myself when he looked at me.
It was nice.
I was thinking about
introducing him to the kids.
Now I'm, I'm back in the house of secrets
with a man who looks at me like...
like that.
God, Robert,
why on Earth did you come for me?
Quite the runner, Mitch.
Hey, knock it off!
Let him go!
Break it up. Break it up.
All right, it's all right.
To what do I owe this pleasure
A lot of people in town
who aren't going to let this stand.
They're angry.
They're talking about coming out here
to get him by force if necessary.
Did you ever in your life think anyone would
care this much about Mitchell Cafferty?
Look, you don't want it to come to that,
I don't want it to come to that.
I'm here to negotiate.
Last time we negotiated,
it didn't work out so good for me.
Keep Mitch and keep the food.
You can sell the food to the town through
Gracie Lee's market
and take your cut off the top in supplies
that we have and you don't:
fresh water, crops,
salt from the mine.
I'm listening.
In exchange, you'll guarantee that your...
your business stays away from town.
We'll send a trailer to pick up supplies.
You don't come to us.
I'll think about it.
Now let's talk about what I need.
- I want to talk to Emily.
- She doesn't want to see you.
She blames me for Chris's death.
- Things might be different if she knew
whose fault it really was. - I didn't
sent him on that job, all right? You did.
I tried to talk him out of it.
He needed a lookout,
someone to watch his back.
- You left him alone!
- A lookout?
He needed a father.
- All right. Maybe it is time
Emily learns the truth about what you did.
- I told her.
I told her, I told her everything.
- Did she forgive you?
- No.
Neither do I.
Get her to see me,
- or I'll do business wherever
the hell I please. - I can't.
Then I guess we don't have a deal.
Oh, hey, Eric,
can I borrow you for a minute?
Sure. What's up?
Come on in. I, uh...
I am seeing a lot of
unfamiliar faces around here
and I did some asking around,
and apparently, there are eight new families
since I left town and 14 since the attacks.
Yeah, some families had relatives come
from nearby towns.
- A few more people from Colorado. Why?
- Do we know anything about them?
Where they've been, what they know?
I don't think I like where this
conversation's going, Gray.
Well, neither do I,
but I'm also sure that we can't
be too careful or too prepared.
You mean Robert Hawkins?
The man has two kids.
He's been nothing but helpful.
He shows up two days before the end
of the world with enough cash to buy
the old Thompson house.
Look, I'm not suggesting anything.
I'm-I'm just saying that we should
know a little more about who
we're sharing our foxhole with.
It costs us nothing to find out.
Is there something you want to tell me?
What do you mean?
That jewelry box is missing.
Did you steal from me, Dale?
Say something.
Why did you lie to her?
- Why did you tell her you didn't
have the box? - We made a fair trade.
I shouldn't have to explain myself
to some spoiled little girl.
- You don't know her.
- Oh, I know her and everybody like her.
They think the rules don't apply to them.
I could understand others
trying to steal from me
but after everything I have done for you?
- Everything you've done for me?
- I took you in.
- -And what?
You let me sleep here?
I was the one who looked for the train.
I was the one who walked five miles
every day dragging food back here.
You wouldn't have a store
if it wasn't for me.
- Dale, honey...
- You know what?
No, I'm done.
Here's your keys back.
Dale, no!
Hey.
Where's Mary?
Uh, Wednesday, night off.
- What are you drinking there?
- I don't know.
I think it might be kerosene.
I haven't quite figured out the still yet.
So how'd things go with Jonah today?
I think I might have gotten us into a fight
we don't want to be a part of.
Nice.
How about you?
How was your day?
Well, I think I'm becoming
Graynderson's yes man.
The worst part of it is I'm
not sure if that's a bad thing.
Big day for the Green boys, huh?
- Yeah. You avoiding going home telling Dad?
- Hell, yeah. You?
- Same.
Yeah. You remember that time we set
the carpet in Dad's office on fire?
All you had to do was stick to the story,
we would have been fine.
- You wanted me to tell Dad I had a seizure
and knocked over his desk lamp.
- Yeah.
Any other brilliant ideas
to get us out of this one?
Not at the moment.
Well, I say we finish these drinks
go home and try to explain all this to Dad
in a way that won't kill him.
I think you've had enough to drink.
You want to come with me
so we can finish our conversation?
- No, I'm done talking for the day, Rob.
- I'm not kidding, Darcy.
- Let's just go.
- No, all right?
- Not this time.
Why don't you go home?
Hey...
I came back for you
because you are my wife.
Hey, uh, I'm not sure how you feel about
tomato soup
but I don't know.
It usually makes me feel better, so...
How's it coming?
I've been going over
all of my pending audits
and I can only remember half the details
of half my cases.
This one is for "almost there," and
this one is for "not even close."
- You don't need to be doing all this.
- What the hell else am I going to do?
Oh!
Oh!
Get out of my way.
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Well, stop it.
Look, I know what you're going through.
All right? I lost my folks
when I was 18 years old,
and the first few days were, were bad.
Everything and everyone that I ever cared
about was incinerated four weeks ago.
And you mean to tell me
that you know how I feel?
- I'm trying to be nice to you.
- Well, stop being nice to me!
You don't owe me anything.
You don't owe anyone anything anymore.
Em. What are you doing here?
I came here to talk to you,
but when I got here...
- Hurry.
- What?
- Hurry.
He went into shock or something.
And one, and two, three, four. Five...
1,001... 1,002... 1,003...
1,004... 1,005.
- He's not breathing.
- Okay, one more breath.
Let's get him over on his side. Come on.
I've given him three courses of antibiotics.
It must have been too much for his system.
He's become septic.
How do we treat it?
Wait a minute, April.
How do we treat it?
If the Med Center were operational-- maybe.
If we could MEDEVAC him into County Hospital
in Rogue River, maybe.
If we had any heavy-duty meds
left in the pharmacy, maybe.
Without that...
12 hours.
Maybe a day.
I'm so sorry.
What kind of meds?
What?
You said he needed heavy-duty meds.
What, what kind would he need?
Something strong enough to blow out the
infection fast.
Let his body heal itself.
Cipro, probably, but we ran out weeks ago.
- They'd have it in Rogue River, though.
- Jake.
That's 90 miles away.
- I'd better get going, then.
- Wait a minute.
I'm going, too.
Eric. no.
If Gray's right about how dangerous...
Go.
Go now.
You wanted to talk.
Let's talk.
- You want to sit?
- No. I'm not here to catch up.
Jake Green's dad's sick.
- That so?
- Yeah.
I don't care what you think of him, okay?
I'm here to ask for your help.
I'm not a doctor, sweetheart.
No, you're not.
You're a thief.
- He needs meds.
He needs Cipro.
- Don't have it. Sorry.
But I may be able to help.
- Your mother used to make that same face.
- Stop it.
You do not get to talk
about her. Or Chris. Okay?
I heard you're getting married.
What kind of guy is he?
- How many questions do I have to
answer to get your help? - More.
- What's he do? The guy.
- He's an investment banker.
Emily.
I've stuck by our agreement to stay away.
But the past few weeks,
I've seen a lot of bad things.
I just want to know
somebody's looking out for you.
It's just you and me now.
Your mom's gone.
- Chris is gone.
- Is that what this is?
- Hmm?
- What?
You want us to be a family?
Want somebody to invite
you for Thanksgiving dinner?
If you think for one second
that I would do that again, you're crazy.
I think if you want my help
saving Johnston Green's life,
you got a funny way of asking, young lady.
You're gonna get my help.
You're my kid.
But I think you and I need to
start seeing more of each other.
Dale.
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
How did you get this?
Thank you.
My God, this is what the fight was about.
Where are you staying tonight?
Ah... A friend's house.
A friend's house?
Come on.
You can sleep on the couch at my place.
- I don't think this is such a good idea.
- No choice.
Well, then at least let me do
some work on the car.
There's no time.
- I have to go now.
- What? Wait.
- You said it was sturdy.
- Well, sturdy, yeah, but what if
you need to outrun something?
- Why? How fast will it go?
- I don't know.
30, maybe 40 miles an hour, best
case, downhill, and not for very long.
See, this is what I'm saying. Maybe
you should go on horseback.
- A horse is slower than that.
- A horse is less likely to explode.
I'll take my chances.
Okay, well, then, at least open her up easy.
Make sure you have enough car left
in case you need to ask for a lot in a hurry
and remember, the gas tank on this thing
is on the left-hand side
so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you
make sure it's not on that side.
Anything else?
Come back in one piece.
I will, I promise.
I thought you were gonna go.
I'm waiting on Eric.
Oh.
Um...
- Watch out for giant irradiated
hands out there. - Always do.
Okay.
You going somewhere?
Yeah, my father needs
medication, stuff we don't have in town.
Jake and I are going to
Rogue River to find it.
You sure that's a good idea?
Not really.
Listen, you be careful out
there, all right? You don't...
you don't stop for anything,
you don't even slow down.
I mean it.
We'll be back before morning.
Do you mind keeping an eye on things here?
Of course, yeah, don't worry about it.
Aw, what the hell?
This is what we're driving?
Yeah, I mean, it's not actually a...
Yeah.
What in the world?
I thought the deal was we'd go get the food
and he'd stay away.
It was.
Em?
I couldn't get you the meds you needed, so
I got you the second-best thing.
A fast car.
He said it's a gift.
You know there are no gifts with him.
I'm really sorry you got dragged into this.
Nobody dragged me.
Go save your dad.
Eric? Load up.
--Jake...
--I see it.
--Slow down.
Not stopping until we get to Rogue River.
--You can't just leave her on the side of
the road like that.
--See that second set of skid marks back there?
Means someone forced her off the road
and probably robbed her and killed her.
For all we know, they could be waiting out there
to do it again.
I don't like it anymore than you do
but if we don't make it, Dad dies.
This is the world we live in now.
Oh.
Yes, it's ready.
Oh, no, honey, watch out, sweetie.
It's hot.
Wow, I can't believe it worked, Mom.
Yes, your father is a very smart man.
--Should I go get him?
--No, honey. He's working.
Besides, this thing needs time to cool.
Hello.
Mrs. Hawkins, do you mind if we come
in for a few minutes?
Hey, Gray Anderson and Jimmy are here to see you.
--They say about what?
--No.
I mean, I didn't get the feeling it
was just a friendly house call.
Okay.
Okay.
I got a route to the County Hospital in Rogue River.
--Take Cedar Run Road...
--No good.
You don't even know what I was going to say.
--Put the map away, we're taking the back roads.
--Jake, Dad's on borrowed time.
--We need to get the medicine and get back here!
-- I spent most of my teenage years driving these roads.
We'll make up the time.
You always think you know better.
These things loaded?
Yes, it's loaded.
What are we going to have to do, Jake?
I don't know, but when it comes time to do it...
I'll be ready.
You haven't said anything for miles.
Stay sharp.
What happened to you, Jake?
--What do you mean?
--The last five years?
Where were you?
I'm assuming jail.
--Why won't you tell me?
--Why does it matter?
Because, all that time
I stood and I watched Mom and Dad suffer.
Every time the phone rang,
they thought it was you.
I used to hate calling the house
because we sound the same on the phone.
I couldn't listen to them
realizing it was only me.
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry
for what I did to our family
but don't use me as an excuse
for not getting on with your life.
What's that supposed to mean?
You wouldn't be the first guy
to leave his wife, Eric.
Look, I'm not telling you to leave her
--I'm just saying that...
-- You don't know what you're talking about, Jake.
I'm talking about what you're afraid to say.
Life's too short.
Well, don't worry about me.
Just drive.
--Thanks for talking with us, Robert.
--No problem, Gray.
What's this all about?
When I was in Topeka,
people were saying that all of this could
be a first step in a foreign invasion,
except that getting all these bombs
into the country would be pretty difficult...
Without help on the inside.
Exactly.
I understand you and your family
moved to Jericho just before the attacks.
You bought your house in cash on a cop's salary.
--Am I under arrest for not taking on
a 30-year mortgage?
--No, of course not.
Well, if you wouldn't mind
--my family and I were just about
to sit down to dinner.
--Actually, if you wouldn't mind humoring us,
for a couple more minutes.
You know, since all of this happened
we're all, I think, understandably curious
about anybody who's new in Jericho.
Well, why don't you just ask me the question?
You really think I was the mastermind behind the largest
terrorist attack in the history of the world?
Were you?
Sorry... Listen, would you mind
if I just ask your family a few questions?
That's funny.
You know, when I was a cop,
that is just the kind of thing
that I would say during an interrogation.
--Purely informational.
--And I would have said that, too, Gray.
Well, Darcy's been wanting
to get to know the neighbors.
Come on.
How long can he hold on like this?
I can't say for sure.
Maybe 12 hours.
--12 hours?
--I am so sorry.
I... I've been married to that man for a long time.
I refuse to believe this is the way it ends.
--Oh,  hey.
--Hey.
--I brought some food.
--Yeah. Come in.
Gail's upstairs.
I used to have this phobia of dairy products
that didn't need to be refrigerated.
Now I think God for processed cheese food.
I brought soup-- creamy mushroom
--The only stuff I have left is what I had
for the food drive.
--I guess we're not the only ones.
How is he?
He's getting worse.
April doesn't think he has a lot of time.
Oh, hi.
I heard the door.
I thought it was the boys.
Heather brought some food.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
I'm so sorry about your husband, Mrs. Green.
In this day and age,
how can someone die of a fever?
It's the 21st century,
I can't get the right drugs.
Can't even find ice to cool him off.
I can make ice.
I... one of the students had a project
in the science fair last year.
I just need water and...
Do you have fertilizer?
Maybe. In the garage.
Okay. I can do this... I think.
Okay, let's try.
Okay. Grab every large bowl you have.
And can you get some buckets, and get
some fresh water from the well.
It'll be cooler.
I'll get the fertilizer.
Buckets are in the laundry room.
Where is everybody?
Come on.
Let's get to the hospital.
See those markings?
These homes were evacuated 10-25 by FEMA.
10-25-- that means they came through a
month after the bombs.
Well, if FEMA was here, at least there's still
some sort of government.
As  of a week ago.
What  are the other numbers?
The zero is the number they found alive.
And the two?
The number of dead.
We're going to go in, we're going to get the medicine,
and we're going to get out.
Okay.
"Federal Emergency Management Agency
has determined that
radioactive fallout from the blast in Lawrence,
Kansas has contaminated the water table of this region.
"Under no circumstances should water
from any taps or wells be consumed. FEMA."
Well, I guess that explains why
this place is empty.
What the hell?!
Where's that coming from?!
We got to get inside!
Stay close.
Oh, my God.
What happened here?
You okay?
Yeah.
--Where do you think those shots came from?
--Top floor.
Who the hell would be shooting at us?
I don't know; if they have any Cipro,
it's probably upstairs.
.556.
From an automatic weapon.
Maybe they belong to these guys.
--I didn't know Rogue River had a SWAT team.
--They don't.
These guys aren't cops.
They're government contractors.
A private army. A firm called Ravenwood.
What are mercenaries doing in Kansas?
The same thing they've been
doing in Iraq and New Orleans.
The military's been stretched so thin
the past few years, mercenaries became a commodity.
The real question is,
did they kill these people?
--Look, let's just get the drugs and go, okay?
--All right.
--You ready?
--Yeah.
Nice job with the stove.
You burn the wood in the broiler-- right.
Yeah. You know, we're just lucky
we had gas instead of an electric
'cause it's got its own built-in vent.
Where's your brother?
How should I know?
I'm here with you.
Allison... manners.
Let me know when dinner's back on.
Will you, um... just pardon me a moment?
So, Darcy, why did you decide to move to Jericho?
Hey.
I don't like that guy.
I need you to do something for me, okay?
The ammonium nitrate in fertilizer
extracts the heat from the water.
--How long is this supposed to take?
--I think a while.
I'm going to go up and check on him.
God, I hope I'm not screwing this up.
She's been up for 24 hours.
They've been married for 40 years.
Can you imagine?
I'm was supposed to be married tomorrow.
Hey, hey.
Roger's coming back.
So'Jake.
All right, stay close to the wall.
Come on. Come here.
Look, if something happens to me, get
in the car and go.
All right? Find another town.
Search house to house, if you have to.
Jake, nothing is going to happen to you.
Okay? Nothing ever does.
Go! Go! Move!
You went to Crow Island School.
We moved here after our grandfather died.
--Sam, are you listening?
--I'm hungry. I want dinner.
Oh, God...
You know what, Sam?
You should tell that to the guys in there.
Just keep saying it as much
as you can, okay.
--Hey, pal, what you drawing?
--My old house.
Oh, yeah?
Well, where is that?
I'm hungry.
Well, you know what, as soon
as we're finished talking
--maybe your mom will give you some of that pie.
--I want it now.
--Well, in a few...
--Now. I'm hungry.
--He gets a little cranky when he's hungry.
--Yeah, I see that.
--You mind if we get him something to eat?
--No, no, of course not.
I'll take him to the kitchen.
Come on, Sam.
Would you mind hanging out for a couple minutes?
Whatever.
Sam.
See ya, buddy.
You okay?
You say something?
All I hear is ringing.
It'll pass in a minute.
--You down there, freeze! Drop your weapons!
--No.
We're here for medicine.
It's an emergency.
We don't want trouble.
There's no medicine here.
We want to look for ourselves.
We can trade you for food.
We have everything we need.
Go away.
--Jake...
--What?
What, are you crazy?
Didn't you hear him? He's scared.
He threw a grenade. That was a flash-bang,
not a grenade.
It's just loud and bright to scare us.
If he'd wanted to kill us, he would have.
Putting our weapons down and coming up.
You come up and I'll shoot you.
All right, just take it easy.
That's far enough.
Gail...
Oh, it's me, April.
Gail's downstairs.
She'll be up soon.
I wish there was something more I could do.
But there isn't.
Please just hold on a little longer.
Can I tell you a secret?
You are going to be a grandfather.
I haven't told anyone yet.
Not even Eric.
I don't know what he's going to say.
But this child needs a grandpa.
Hold on, okay?
Please.
You're with Ravenwood.
How do you know?
I spent a year and a half in the Green Zone
running a supply rig up and down
Route Irish to BIAP.
You were in Iraq?
--Soldier?
--No, I just drove a truck for another contractor
but I met a lot of Ravenwood guys.
Where were you?
Fallujah.
Man, I thought I had it bad.
I thought it was the worst thing
I'd ever lived through...
till  now.
You mind putting that thing down?
I'm just here for medicine.
We don't have a lot of time.
This is my brother Eric. I'm Jake.
Come on.
Randy Payton.
I'll take you to see the doc.
You're in, uh...
you're in pretty bad shape.
Morphine and instant coffee are the only things
keeping me standing right now.
What are you doing in Kansas?
Not enough National Guard.
Homeland Security hired us.
Brought us in to protect
the governor of Nebraska.
Wait, the governor's alive?
Don't know.
When we landed,
they brought us over here to help FEMA
evacuate Rogue River.
Where to?
FEMA  set up a tent city in a Wal-Mart parking lot.
A few miles north of here.
What happened to these people?
These are the ones that couldn't be moved.
Too old...
too sick.
So you just killed them?
No, not me.
We tried to move them.
But the doctors wouldn't allow it.
There were so many of them.
Crying out, begging.
The guys, they just wanted to come in
and they just wanted to take the medicine
and they wanted to leave
but the doctors started arguing with them
and then, one of our guys, he...
he just snapped.
He started firing.
Before I knew it, they all emptied their weapons.
Why didn't you stop them?
How do you think I got shot?
They left me for dead with everybody else.
There's the doc.
When I came to, he was working on me.
Patched me up as best he could.
Been trying to save everybody else since then.
I need more bloody light.
--Doc?
--Yeah?
This is Jake and Eric.
And they need medicine.
Dr. Kenchy Dhuwalia.
Forgive me if I don't shake your hand.
I need Cipro.
Right.
Morphine's worth a lot more, you know?
Hey, I'm not selling it, all right?
I need it now.
It's for my father.
It's Ravenwood.
They're back.
There are six or eight of them.
They brought a truck.
They're gonna clean out the hospital.
Medicine, supplies, anything that's not nailed down.
And they're gonna kill anybody they find alive.
We know what they did.
We can't let them get inside.
Hey! Hey!
One down.
--What about a back exit?
--It's barricaded.
You want to live, stand up and fight.
Well, that's when my grandma died
and left everything to my parents.
They wanted me out of the school
I was in, so... we moved.
--Was your father away from home
a lot when you were a kid?
--Of course. He's a cop.
Mm. Did he bring friends around, anybody
you thought was kind of strange?
His friends are all cops.
What about money?
--Did your parents ever argue over money?
--Doesn't everyone's?
No, I-I'm thinking...
you know, about the sudden windfall.
--Like my Grandma's inheritance?
--Right.
When was that again?
What-what, are you stupid?
I already told you, six months ago.
Don't be disrespectful, Allison.
Dad, this is bull-- he's in our house
acting like we're criminals or something.
--Are you harassing everyone in
town or just the black people?
-- That's enough
--Why are you letting him do this?
--Look, I apologize, Mr. Anderson.
--You're  apologizing to him?
--Yes, and so will you.
--Oh-ho, forget that. I'm not sorry.
--Apologize.
Dad, he's a racist!
I hate this stupid town--
I wish we never moved!
They're coming in.
Why weren't they shooting?
Ammo's in short supply-- they're
gonna wait to fight in close.
--Take some of these clips.
--They're all empty.
Look, we got to get the medication
and get out of here. Doc!
Where's the Cipro?
--Where's the Cipro!
--On the shelf.
They're gonna come straight for us.
We got to hide, let 'em pass,
then we can slip out.
I couldn't even save one.
Not even one!
Doc, we got to go or we're gonna be dead, too.
--I got it, I got it!
--Come on!
My girl's been through a lot.
--But I raised her better than that.
--I want to assure you, Mr. Hawkins,
that this is not about color.
Black, white or otherwise, my only objective
is to protect the people of Jericho.
I got a boy about the same age.
You should bring yours over sometime-- Samuel
could use a playmate.
Would you mind if Jimmy has a quick look
around the house while we talk?
Excuse me?
Just a question of being thorough.
And is... searching houses standard policy here?
I thought this was... Kansas, not Soviet Russia.
You know, we been pretty easy-going about all this.
And I'm only asking for a little more
patience so I know I can vouch for you.
Unless... you're afraid
there's something we'll find.
You know, if you can overlook the mess...
...we can overlook the violation of our civil rights.
Um...
I'll just take a quick peek around, and...
then we'll be on our way.
Come on, let's go.
What do you say we wait
till they leave the building?
That could take hours--
Dad doesn't have hours.
What's wrong with him?
He's gone into septic shock.
Sepsis? You have to go back.
What are you talking about?
If your father's in septic shock,
that means his organs are shutting down.
That means that by the time
you get to him
his body won't even be able
to process the Cipro.
You need an intravenous drug.
It's called Levaquin.
--It's back in the ICU.
--What's it look like?
It's a clear bottle, purple label.
--You'll need syringes.
--Jake, this is nuts. We can't go back there.
Well, we can't take the chance we have
the wrong medicine.
--What, we gonna shoot our way through?
--Yeah, if I have to.
I'm with you.
Are you with me or not?
Okay.
--But we need a plan.
--All right.
This is definitely taking too long.
Like the water should be freezing by now.
You know, let's just dump these and start over.
--Okay, shouldn't we wait till we figure out
what we've done wrong?
No. This is all we have.
The mayor's running out of time.
We got to cool him down.
Everybody's counting on me,
and it's not working.
Yeah, but we have to give it time to work.
Okay, you're freaking out!
This one's cold.
It's working.
What did you do differently with this one?
The... the bowl-- it's aluminum.
--God, plastic's an insulator-- I'm so stupid.
--So we just need more of these, right?
--Yeah.
--Anything metal-- pie tins, anything.
--All right, I'll get 'em from the kitchen.
--Okay.
We got ice!
Don't shoot.
I'm a doctor. I'm unarmed.
On your knees.
Who are you?
I can help your friend.
What's your name?
What's your name?
--Don't make me ask you again.
--Eric.
Eric Green. I'm a doctor.
The Red Cross brought me here.
To shoot at me?
--That wasn't me.
--Who was it?
The guys in that muscle car?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are they?
Where are they?
They're in the therapy room downstairs.
There's, uh, three or four of them.
Get 'em.
Your man lost a lot of blood.
I can help him.
Get up.
Fire in the hole!
Clear left.
Clear right.
Room's empty. Move out.
All right, we need something to cut his shirt.
Uh, s-something sterile.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm... I'm just getting something for the pain.
He can handle the pain.
Just get to work.
You people drafted my husband
into your police force
and now you're suspecting him
of being a criminal.
We're not suspecting anything.
--We just want to know...
--Yeah.
"Who's in your town."
Yeah, I heard.
This has been unpleasant for all of us.
Some more than others.
I found something.
Darcy.
I'm gonna need a minute alone with Mr. Anderson.
Payton, let's go! Go on! Come on!
Car's out front. Go!
No. This is on me.
--Payton. They'll kill you. Come on.
--I don 't care.
I deserve this.
I emptied my gun up there, too.
Go. Let me do this.
Come on! Go!
--Where's Payton?
--He's not coming.
Why didn't you just tell me
you were a federal agent?
How do you even know that that badge is real?
I guess...
I don't.
The fakes are usually made of aluminum.
It's cheaper. Lighter.
If it's heavy...
...that's how you know.
Don't just assume that because somebody has
one of these that it is real
especially not these days.
--But why didn't you say anything?
--Because I don't know you.
I don't know who I can trust.
You see, the bureau was tracking some
suspicious contacts
between unknown people
in this area of Kansas and...
terrorist groups abroad.
What kind of contacts?
Pay phone calls.
Money transfers.
You know, I was relocated to investigate
undercover, Mr. Anderson.
and as far as I'm concerned
I am still on the job, so...
--I would appreciate your discretion.
--No, of course. Jimmy's the only one who knows.
--I'll make sure it stays that way.
--Good.
The people who did this, they will try
to hit us again.
We can't let that happen.
But from now on, we keep an open line
with one another.
Okay, then.
Man, it's been a long day.
If you don't mind...
I'm just happy to have you on the team, Mr. Hawkins.
I'm very sorry for the intrusion.
You do not have to apologize for anything.
You did good work.
Is he?
Barely. Just hurry.
--Okay, let's go.
--April...
--This is Dr. Kenchy.
--April Green.
Did you get the Cipro?
This is Levaquin.
It will go directly into his system.
--Are we on time?
--Well...
if his body is strong enough,
we will know by morning.
He's strong enough.
You're gonna be all right, Dad.
You're going to be okay, sweetheart.
It's a nice job.
Got the key?
Thank you.
I know you're one of the good guys.
--Thanks for staying with my mom.
--Glad to help.
She's being humble.
She saved your father's life.
Well, you guys get some sleep.
What did you see out there?
Another time.
Good night.
Good night.
--What's all this stuff?
--I don't know.
How you feeling?
Honestly...
Couldn't tell you.
You'll be okay.
All right?
You'll get through this.
You're a much better person than I am, so...
I know you'll be fine.
I don't know if I'm a better person.
I'm in love with Mary Bailey.
You knew that, didn't you?
I'm gonna tell April.
Life's too short, right?
Whatever you do, I'm sure
it'll be the right thing.
Let's get some rest.
Where's my jacket?
I don't know. Did you leave it in the car?
Jake, I left my jacket back there--
the wallet is in the jacket-- the address.
--What if those guys come here?
--Those guys are dead, all right?
Payton took care of it.
Don't worry.
--I'm sorry I screwed up.
--You did great out there today.
Get some sleep, we'll worry about it tomorrow.
--Good night.
--Good night.
Good. See to that.
Mount up, boys! We're moving out!
Jericho.
It's straight up 8:00
on a perfect autumn morning.
So get up, get out of bed...
You heard the man.
Rise and shine, babe.
I thought we were gonna sleep in.
- We did, got up at 6:00.
- Oh, Roger.
Maybe this wedding isn't such a good idea.
Still have a few hours to change your mind.
- If you come back to bed, I won't.
- Oh, Emily, I wish.
Got to meet the folks.
Apparently, they're not all that thrilled
about their accommodations.
'Cause they're only in the best
bed-and-breakfast in town.
Yeah, well, when you're used to staying
at the Pierre overlooking Central Park...
Do you think your parents will
ever get used to a small town girl
stealing away their big city boy?
Sure.
Soon as we move back to civilization.
Right.
Noise and traffic and pollution.
Don't forget about the crime.
I'm not kidding, Roger.
This is it.
When we're married, this is where we live.
Sure that's what you want?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sure it's what you want?
Roger. Roger! Roger! Roger.
We're filling up the hummers now.
- What's that?
- Some one in the window.
There's someone here.
Hey!
What the hell are you guys doing out there?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Sorry, we didn't want to knock at this hour.
- Stanley, what's going on?
- Go back inside and lock the door.
You're on private property.
This isn't a gas station.
I'll see to it you're reimbursed, sir.
- We work for the federal government.
- Yeah, what kind of work?
Just making sure folks have
everything they need--
medical supplies, clean water, food.
A friend of mine told me to look
him up if we came through.
You know Eric Green?
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Thanks for the fill-up.
Hey.
You stay down here all night?
Thought I'd keep an eye out, just in case.
- Listen, Jake, yesterday when
you talked about where you been...
- How'd it go with April?
Did you tell her about you and Mary?
Didn't think it was the right time.
Yeah, it's never gonna be.
Eric...
Hey, come in.
Hey.
Sorry to come by so early.
We were awake.
What's up?
Some guys showed up at the farm last night.
Couple Humvees, guns.
- They knew Eric's name.
- Ravenwood.
Who?
Mercenaries.
We ran across them in Rogue River.
Okay, well, what the hell do they want?
Everything.
- Ravenwood? What the hell is that?
- It's a private security firm.
They hire thugs and army dropouts
They give them big guns and
send them out to play soldier.
- What are they doing in Kansas?
- FEMA hired them to evacuate Rogue River.
But now they're in business for themselves.
They stripped the town of all their supplies
they killed police and civilians.
You've heard of these guys?
- Now they want to hit Jericho.
- I think they were scouts.
- Probably want to know if we're worth a
visit. - We should fortify, just in case.
- Shore up our borders at
the most vulnerable points.
- Already there.
- I ordered armed checked points
on Cherry Valley Road and Route 660.
- Check points?
Yeah, keep track of who's coming into town.
The mayor was sick, you were gone,
I figured it shouldn't wait.
They'll probably come from the east
across the Tacoma Bridge.
I think we should block it.
My farm is on the other side of that bridge.
- And so's 30 other families. - Everyone
on that side will have to come into town.
- It's not safe to stay over there. - Over
there. You want me to abandon my farm?
- Jake, you've got to be kidding.
- Just for now, Stanley.
Bill, get some guys together,
start collecting ammo.
Whatever they're willing to part with.
- We'll stockpile it here.
- I still have some explosives at the mine.
We'll take anything you got.
Morning, April.
I thought I could get
Johnston to eat something.
No, it's better to let him sleep.
Let his body adjust to the meds.
Oh, okay.
- You ready for some more good news?
- Are you kidding?
His blood pressure's stabilizing.
And the fever seems to be resolving.
I think he's going to be okay.
Well, that calls for a real celebration.
Can I offer you some mashed black-eyed peas?
None for me.
It hasn't been a particularly good morning
if you know what I mean.
'Course, it could be the nerves
as much as the pregnancy.
Nerves? You didn't tell Eric yet?
Oh, he was just so exhausted last night.
And then he was up and gone
before I had the chance.
- Any idea where he went?
- No.
He and Jake were both gone
when I came downstairs this morning.
Gail...
do you think he'll...
well, the timing just seems so...
You're talking about my first grandchild.
The timing couldn't be better.
Now tell him.
Get as many guys as you can.
There's a farm up the road
with a couple of dead trucks.
- Bring them back here,
we'll use them as a barricade.
- Got it.
- You think that'll make a difference?
- It's better than nothing.
This isn't your first run-in
with Ravenwood, is it?
Why?
You go off on your road trip
all of a sudden they're headed for Jericho.
Would've thought you'd
be more careful is all.
You think I led them here on purpose?
Hey, I'm just trying to put
the pieces together, Jake.
Well, let me make it easy for you.
- My family lives in Jericho.
- So does mine.
- Everything I do, I do to protect them.
- Same here, man.
Well, then let's stop screwing
around and get it done.
What am I doing?
- Em, you in there?
It's Heather.
- Yeah, just a second.
- Sorry to barge in.
- That's okay.
These are for you.
- Closest thing I could find
to a wedding bouquet. - Thanks.
I'm sorry, is this weird?
You were supposed to get married today.
I figured I should do something special.
You know, to acknowledge the day.
Maid of honor and all.
Just ignore me, okay?
This is really sweet, what you did.
You got any plans for today?
Besides not getting married?
'Cause I kind of planned a whole day
to keep you occupied.
I thought we'd start with a hike.
- Nothing exotic,
just a hike along the river.
- I don't think I'm gonna be great company.
Company's kind of the point.
- Keep moping to a minimum.
- I don't really have a choice, do I?
Not so much.
Good.
Okay, we're gonna need another car.
Put it here.
Let me guess-- this isn't your first run-in
with these guys either, is it?
- You know, there's only one thing I
need to know from you, Jake.
- What?
Would you even know when
you're in over your head?
- Hey, you're back.
- Yeah.
Just for a second.
Got to get this stuff to town hall.
Eric, wait.
I have...
I have something to tell you.
Okay.
Let's talk.
When I, uh... had the divorce papers drafted
I did that because I couldn't see
a future for us.
But now I can.
I can't.
What?
Look, the last thing I want to do
on this Earth is to hurt you, April...
but I'm in love with someone else.
Who?
Mary Bailey.
April...
Look, April...
- April, I'm sorry...
- No, you don't get to do this.
You son of a bitch.
Get the trucks! Let's go!
They're coming!
They're here.
Hey, they're here!
Come on, back.
Just run!
Come on, hustle.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, move. Move.
Everybody keep moving.
Check your positions, check
your clips, safety's off.
Come on, everybody!
- Remember what we talked about!
- Nobody fires until I say so.
And everybody remember all right?
The most important thing to do before
squeezing the trigger is to breathe, okay?
Somebody here want to talk to me?
Whoever's in charge,
this road needs to be cleared.
We're under government
orders to collect supplies.
Breathe.
Cease fire.
Cease fire.
Listen up.
We're here on government
orders to collect supplies.
Your cooperation is mandatory?
Understood?
Mandatory.
When I get back here,
this bridge better be cleared.
Or I'll clear it myself.
You got four hours.
Understood?
Let's roll.
What the hell are we going to do?
There's no way we can hold this bridge.
We're going to have to take it out.
I agree.
What are you saying?
There can't be a bridge.
I struck gold with Mr. Adams.
- He gave up all that ammo without fight?
- Oh, he kept plenty.
Guy's rec room looks like
the basement of the Alamo.
- Where do you want this?
- In the gun locker.
Eric...
Why aren't you at the bridge?
We need to talk.
- No way, we're not doing it.
- Think about it-- with the bridge gone,
we can't be overrun.
Until Ravenwood turns around and
comes at us from another direction.
Not before they pass New Bern
or some other town.
- Better them than us.
- This will buy us time.
Then we focus our manpower and resources
on securing the other roads.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
If we destroy that bridge,
it is gone forever.
Do you think we can do without it?
What about the farms on the other side?
- Access to the food for winter.
- There are farms closer to town.
Okay, what about the homes you'll isolate?
- Jake, that means cutting off Stanley.
- They'll have to come over.
- Look, there has to be a better way.
- Ravenwood is coming back right now.
We've got no time.
What do you suggest?
We can get more men.
- Pull them off the outposts if we have to.
- Send more men out there, you're
going to get more men killed.
Bill...
lock up the explosives.
- Now wait a minute...
- Nothing happens to that bridge.
We can face them with
whatever we can muster.
- How can you...?!
- The answer is no.
Okay, I'm just going to go into Gracie's
and get some trail mix, or, you know,
shoe polish, dental floss, whatever's left.
Oh, and if the engine starts to shake
just slide over and gun the gas.
And keep your eye on the temperature.
If the needle hits the red, cut the gas,
'cause you've got about two seconds before
it's about to explode.
Okay?
- Why-why can't I just go in?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want you to go through the trouble.
Right.
Hey, space cadet, what are you waiting for?
Come on, let's go.
So, this is it.
You ready?
Why, don't I look ready?
Well, you're definitely
dressed for the occasion.
So, yeah, let's roll.
What are you waiting for, Em?
Emily...
Emily...
Emily...
Emily!
Em... Em, Em, turn it off.
- Turn it off.
- I'm sorry.
- There was a truck with
these guys with guns. - Yeah.
Um, we're not hiking today.
Everybody's supposed to stay indoors.
Something's going on outside of town.
- All the roads are blocked.
- Let's go home.
Home? They didn't say "home."
They said "indoors."
Heather, I, uh...
Hey, look, it's not
the end of the world, right?
'Cause that already happened.
What should we do?
We're going to proceed
directly to phase two.
- I found two flare guns.
- Good.
Position a couple of
guys maybe two miles out.
Give them the flare guns.
Tell them to send up a signal
when they have Ravenwood in sight.
Gray, I'm going to round up as
much diesel and fertilizer as I can.
I'll meet you back at the bridge.
He's making explosives?
- So you're blowing it anyway?
- That's right.
Look, Jake, you got loyalty to your brother
and your family, I get that.
So if you want to bow out,
no one will blame you.
But that bridge is coming down.
Where are you going?
Someone's got to tell those people
who live out there to come over.
- So this is phase two?
- Yep.
Hey, you guys here about
that thing at Tacoma Bridge?
Yeah, why do you think we nixed
the healthy portion of today's program?
Keys please.
Uh, I don't know what that plan is
but I don't know if it's such a good idea.
What exactly is the plan?
This may be the last bottle of single
malt Scotch Kansas sees in a long time.
You say the word, we open it.
But if we do, you're not leaving
till it's finished.
So phase two is that we get
completely obliterated?
More or less
Works for me.
He's been here since this morning.
I felt bad for him.
It sounds like he's had
a rough couple of weeks.
Ladies.
So what do you say?
I say what the hell.
That's my girl.
Who's on lookout for the flares?
Stanton Broksmier.
You're blowing up the bridge?
The Millers will be here in an hour.
They got their old Nova working.
You can ride with them.
- Go pack your bag.
- No.
Don't argue with me.
When that car gets here,
you're going to be in it.
Now go.
And what about you?
I'm staying.
Don't be stupid, Stanley.
They're coming back.
Jake, I'll hold them off.
I did it before.
Look, it's going to be a
couple of guys this time.
They left a pile of bodies in Rogue River.
You want to wind up like that?
Stanley, please don't get yourself
killed for a house.
Hey, my grandfather built this house
from the ground up.
And that room you've been sleeping in...
That was my dad's room when he was a kid.
They put that in your audit file?
I'm not about to give it up without a fight.
If we had guardsmen,
people who were trained--
we could take a stand, but we don't.
Once we blow that bridge, everyone who's
on this side of it is on their own.
Okay, so go warn people.
You're wasting time here.
They're here.
Get your stuff.
I'm not leaving.
This is my home, too.
- Bonnie, it is not safe for you here.
- I'm not afraid.
- Bonnie... don't argue with me.
- We'll be okay if we stay together.
Stanley.
- She's not going?
- I can't force her.
You're risking her life-- and yours.
- I don't get it, Stanley.
- Because it's not your family.
Bonnie grew up in this house, we both did.
This house is her only connection to a
mother and father she barely even remembers.
That's funny, I though you were
that connection.
Good luck.
Skoal.
Ah!
Oh...
Whoa.
This is your captain speaking.
- We are experiencing minor turbulence.
- Are you okay?
I am awesome.
Hey.
You there.
Mr. Dark and Intriguing.
Keep my friend company till I get back
and there's a shot in it for you.
Your friend is spicy, huh?
May I?
- So it's your birthday?
- No.
I...
No.
To privacy then.
Pretty bad out there, isn't it?
Oh, poverty, murder, disease.
It's bloody miserable.
Sorry. Sorry.
- I am drunk, and I haven't slept in weeks.
- Me, too.
- Sent everything out, right?
- The last box just went out on the truck.
Bill, what's going on here?
I'm sorry, Eric.
I got this, Bill.
- Where the hell's the dynamite?!
- The decisions been made.
- We're blowing the bridge.
- Who's "we"? - Myself, Robert Hawkins,
the deputies... and your brother.
- Hey.
- I've got to talk to Dad.
- No, you will talk to me right now.
- I don't have time.
April told me.
- Mom, I didn't mean for things to
turn out this way. - Oh, really? How
did you mean for things to turn out?
You're the one who chose not
to work on your marriage.
- You're the one who chose
to cheat on your wife.
- I am trying to do the right thing.
- I know it doesn't seem that way
right now... - What's going on?
- Johnston...
- Dad...
The mercenaries from Rogue River,
they followed us back.
We have a checkpoint at the Tacoma
Bridge and I think we can defend it
but there's this plan to destroy
it and cut off the town.
Gray Anderson?
Yeah, he's out there right now wiring it.
- Where are Jimmy and Bill?
- Out there helping Gray.
- Dad, I'm alone I'm this one.
- Get your brother and stop them.
Jake is with them, too.
Then you stop them.
Whatever it takes, you stop them.
Whatever it takes.
- How's it coming?
- Just a few wires left.
Hurry guys.
All right, everybody, keep it moving!
We got to keep up the pace.
We gotta keep moving.
- We see that flare,
it's going to be too late.
- John, I need to borrow your truck. Please.
We don't have much time, folks.
All right, good.
Hold on to that.
Make sure the lines don't cross.
- Keep the gold away from the blue.
- Jake.
Got it. Yeah, yeah.
Eric...
Here, run this to the trunk.
- Dad wants this stopped. - Well,
Dad doesn't have all the information.
- It's still his call, Jake.
- Well, here's not here to make it.
Eric...
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting an end to this.
We could see that flare any minute.
You'll be cut off.
You can't go out there, all right?
Eric!
Oh, my God.
That's the flare!
- They're coming!
- We got two minutes.
- Ravenwood is coming.
Still have to run the trunk line.
Eric's out there.
There's no time, Jake.
Get everybody off the bridge.
- Get as far away as you can.
- What are you doing?
Go! Go now! Go!
Come on, guys!
Come on! Everybody off the bridge!
Get as far away as you can!
We're gonna do it!
We're gonna blow it!
Come on!
Not bad. Not bad this time.
So I had just... just started my practice.
- Been in the country for about six months.
- Where?
Las Vegas.
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.
It's a wonderful town.
It's really a wonderful place.
It's not quite so wonderful
without water and electricity.
Practically threw myself
at the Red Cross to get out.
A noble gesture, designed to save
my own ass.
You did what you had to do.
So, they sent me to Kansas, and here I am.
I really should be sitting by a pool
surrounded by beautiful women.
Redheads, preferably.
And blondes. Blondes, too.
Yeah, smoking a cigar,
living the American dream.
- I was supposed to be married today.
- Really?
I was going to be right...
right over there.
Feet kicked up, having a drink.
- Emily!
- Yeah?
- What do you want to hear next?
- Same one.
"Polyester Bride" on endless loop?
Are you being ironic on your wedding day,
Emily Sullivan?
If I was being ironic, it would Alanis.
And it's Emily Hammond in, like,
30 minutes.
Hey, hold on there.
We need extra hands, okay?
Heather, there's no way I can
leave with the bar this busy.
- Can you hold the phone up during
the wedding so I can hear?
- Got you programmed.
- Hey, Stanley, when are you
getting dressed? - After the game.
The wedding is in a half an hour.
Oh! Overtime?! Why?!
Before we head over to the church
I'd like to make a toast to the
blushing bride and banker boy.
Banker man.
Well, it's a banker any way you slice it.
Who here would have ever matched Roger
with Emily?
Talk about high-risk investment.
There's nothing risky about him.
Exactly.
To Emily and Roger.
May they live happily together
in eternal blandness.
Never questioning their life
never looking too closely.
Never wondering if they weren't meant
for something else.
Down the hatch, everybody.
To the future.
Rest in peace.
What does he think he's doing?
He's making a stand.
The bridge is wired.
You just parked over a couple
of pounds of dynamite.
Turn your trucks around or I blow it.
We're on government orders to
collect food and medicine for a
refuge camp near the Rogue River.
Same government that ordered you
to kill all those people in the hospital?
It's been a crazy few weeks.
A lot of confusion out there.
Just step aside, we'll take what
we need and be on our way.
Go ahead.
give the order.
If I go, you go.
Is something funny?
Yeah, this whole thing.
You're not going to push that button.
Here's how it's going to go.
You and your farmer buddies,
you stand down, we get back in our vehicles,
we drive into town take what we need
and never come back.
Nobody has to die.
Man down!
Man down!
You're gonna need a lot more snipers, pal.
We got cars coming!
Get in positions, now!
- Is that Jonah Prowse?
- What the hell's he doing here?
What's this town worth to you?
You know, pretty soon, things are going
to start to get back to normal.
The government will put
itself back together.
And they'll be looking to help
all of you get back on your feet.
And you know who they're going to send?
Me.
Let's go!
Next time you want to destroy my
route into town
I'd appreciate a head's up.
You're welcome.
Really.
Don't mention it.
Can I make a suggestion?
Start figuring out how to
fight for yourselves.
If Eric hadn't come to get me, you'd
all be burying Jake in a shoebox tomorrow.
So is this how it's going to be?
Drunken days, lonely nights,
disturbing visions of a dead fiance?
Are you...?
What?
Dead?
Would that make it easier?
No.
I don't know.
I don't even know what your voice
sounds like, it's been so long.
I should have been on the plane with you.
You never would have left this place.
Ever ask yourself why?
Brother, mother gone.
No father to speak of.
What is it that keeps
you so tied to Jericho?
I don't know.
I think you do.
Em?
You okay?
- What happens if they come back?
- Yeah!
- We've got armed sentries posted.
- If it comes to it,
the bridge is still wired.
I still say we take it out now.
Well, you're not calling the shots, Gray.
- I'm glad to see you up on
your feet, Johnston. - Mayor.
Now, maybe one of you would
like to tell me just exactly
who you think is in charge here.
If we're hit from the other side, that
bridge might be our only line of retreat.
Help is on the other side of that bridge.
Our people-- the whole world--
is on the other side of that bridge.
We destroy that bridge, we've already lost.
Everyone here wants this to happen.
Including your son.
No.
Not everyone.
You guys come up with a real plan
to protect this town, you let me know.
- Dad, I think you should...
- You hold your tongue.
I'm the only one here who was elected.
I will not do this.
It is as simple as that.
Maybe it's time we let the people decide if
they still want you making their decisions.
Stanley?
No, she can't. She can't.
You're an idiot.
Yeah. She said it's fine with her.
Right.
I'll be outside.
I kind of put you in a bad
position out there, huh?
Gray used you, son.
I hope you see that.
Dad, you didn't see what those guys
are capable of.
- But I'm not here to fight.
- What are you here for?
We need a security force.
A real one. Trained.
Sanctioned by you.
This belonged to your grandfather.
He had it on him when he landed at D-day.
When he had to take command of his platoon,
that manual and his training got him
from Omaha Beach into Germany.
I remember the story.
Make sure you do it right.
I'm not coming home tonight.
I'll stop by tomorrow and pack some clothes.
- Look, Mom, April... - Will have a
home with us as long as she wants one.
Thanks, Jimmy.
We did good today.
No.
No, we just got lucky.
Emily?
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
I saw Heather.
She's pretty wasted.
I've been a little over-served myself.
I know what today is.
My mom, she still has
the invitation on the fridge.
You know, we never talked about him.
About Roger.
What do you want to know?
How did he propose?
Cristal and caviar.
Beats the hell out of malt liquor
in a video store parking lot.
We were teenagers.
What the hell did we know?
Knew enough not to go through with it.
Why did you come back, Jake?
Hmm?
Why couldn't you have just stayed away?
Are you sure that's what you wanted?
What did you just say?
Are you sure that's what you wanted?
Previously on Jericho:
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west, maybe Denver.
If it was an attack,
and there is chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people
knowing that Jericho is still here.
Oh, my God, we got something.
- Was that Korean?
- I think it was Chinese.
- Mandarin.
Question is: Were they just
reporting it or are they behind it?
The last time I saw you,
you were going to tell your wife about us
and we were going to
start our life together.
I wake up in the morning and I
want it to be you there so badly.
It hasn't been a particularly good morning,
if you know what I mean?
Of course, it could be the nerves
as much as the pregnancy.
You didn't tell Eric about the baby?
Everyone that I ever cared about
was incinerated four weeks ago.
And you're gonna tell me
that you know how I feel?
- I'm trying to be nice to you.
- Well stop being nice to me!
Hello, Jonah.
The guy did four years at Lansing
for extortion and assault,
and you want to negotiate with that guy?
I've seen what happens when people lose
their hold on law and order--
you start striking bargains with the
bad guys, it's the beginning of the end.
Why are you talking to him?
It's okay, all right? It didn't
have anything to do with you.
He's my father--
it has everything to do with me.
We need a security force.
A real one, trained.
Sanctioned, by you.
Make sure you do it right.
Darn it!
I really thought I had that one.
Well, we'll get 'em next time.
Let's get back on patrol.
- He's trying hard.
They all are.
- Trying?
This isn't a drill.
If he can't hit a turkey with
a shotgun, what happens
when his target shoots back?
- They really invited you on a turkey shoot?
- Mmmm.
- What'd you say?
- I declined politely.
I don't care if it is Thanksgiving.
Be nice to have a real turkey.
- Well, you know, if I shot it,
you would have to clean it.
- Yeah, good point.
Hey, what about you guys?
You gonna be crushed not
to have a turkey this year?
I'm a vegetarian.
Right.
- Well, we'll have plenty for you.
- There's not "plenty" of anything.
We'll make do.
- I'm just glad you're gonna be here.
- Hey, me, too.
How come you missed all
the other Thanksgivings?
- Was business trips.
- On Thanksgiving?
Well, you know...
it wasn't a big holiday
where Daddy was working.
Those days are over, son, okay?
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Oh, you sure you want to donate all at?
A lot of folks need it more than I do.
Some of my students are so skinny
I barely recognize them.
- Where'd you find it?
- The garage.
Roger was such a planner,
you'd think we already had five kids.
- You want to have five kids?
- He wanted five kids.
I said I was good for two,
and after that he was on his own.
Emily, I don't quite know what I'm
serving for Thanksgiving this year
but always know that you're
welcome at our table, honey.
Thanks, I usually go to my aunt's.
- Do you guys still have that football
game before dinner?
- Of course.
There are some things the
apocalypse can't change.
- How's your throwing arm?
- Still better than Jake's.
- Oh, Gray's finally getting that
election, huh? - Yeah, next week.
Is the mayor nervous?
Not as nervous as he should be.
- How long do think it'll take us to
train our guys? - Oh, weeks at best.
Look at us-- for every cop and veteran,
we've got an accountant or travel agent,
or a farmer.
Watch it, buddy.
Think Ravenwood will be back?
When they run out of towns, yeah.
Questions is, how long...
Must have scared them off.
Whoa.
What the...?
Those are the first planes
I've seen since the bombs.
But not the last.
- What is that?
- It sounds like bombers.
Darcy, come on. Everybody.
I want everybody into the
basement until they pass.
- And, hey. Listen, I have got to...
- Okay, go. Go.
What the hell's going on?
What are they dropping?
God only knows.
You think it's a bomb?
Why would someone put
a parachute on a bomb?
Good point.
Whoa, whoa.
- You think that's safe?
- You want to do it?
Okay, I'll shut up.
What is that?
I'd tell you if I knew Chinese.
Whoa, folks, hold up.
Let's just wait until we
know what we got here.
It's all from China.
- Are we being invaded?
- I doubt it.
If they wanted to invade,
they'd have sent troops.
- So this is charity.
- We're getting aid from China?
Why isn't our own government helping us?
- The United Nations or the Red Cross?
- Mayor...
Oh, hey, guys. How many chutes
did you say were out there?
Well, I counted 12.
Well, let's get everybody with a working
vehicle out there and round this stuff up.
- Bring them where?
- Well, for now, here.
- And somebody find Eric for me.
- All right.
- Okay.
So... we're down to a few cases
of liquor and three cases of near beer.
And 13 bottles of mustard.
What about booze from the still?
Well, the last batch tasted like paint
thinner and may cause blindness
but everybody drank it, so...
I guess if they're not all
dead, then we can stay open.
Look, we'll figure it out.
Everything's gonna be fine.
That makes no sense at all.
And yet I totally, completely believe you.
What else do we need?
We got each other and mustard.
- Mayor's looking for you.
- What's up?
- Didn't you hear?
- No, I was in the back.
- Oh, right.
- Doing inventory.
- What is it, Jimmy?
- Uh, planes.
- There are parachutes from China
all over town. - I'm right behind you.
I got to get back.
Bonnie and Mimi must be freaking out.
All right, give him a hand.
- Hawkins.
- Hey.
What does it say?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- I doubt that.
Only one of us speaks Chinese.
What are you talking about, Jake?
The broadcast, when it came over the
satellite, you knew it was Mandarin.
Hey, you know, you can know when
somebody's talking German
but that doesn't mean you
can speak German, right?
That's not what I meant at all.
- What I'm saying is...
- Jake!
- You get a good look at those planes?
- Yeah. The jets were mig 19s.
- he bombers, they looked like Antonovs.
- You know your planes.
My grandfather made sure of that.
- So they were Russian?
- Yeah, except the Russians
stopped making them in the '70s.
- Since when do we let foreign jets
fly through our airspace?
- Happened only once.
Italy patrolled the border after 9-11.
- But that was it.
- And Italy is an ally.
Russia? China?
I imagine the last contact we had
with them were those missiles
we saw flying a few weeks back.
We can't give out this food.
- What are you talking about?
- The people are hungry, Jake.
- I don't care.
- We can't have this conversation here.
- Inside.
- Jake, the people need that food.
- We all could use the food.
How do we know it's safe?
- Well, if the Chinese are trying to
hurt us, they sure picked a funny
way to do it. - What if, what if this
is the second wave of the attacks?
They wait until we're hungry,
and then they poison our food supply.
- Who would do that?
- A smart enemy.
If they were to invade, we'd have no one
healthy enough to fight them.
It's like the British did to the Indians.
- Gave them blankets for the winter,
but didn't mention they were
infected with smallpox. - I don't
even want to think about this.
Do you really think the Chinese
are trying to poison us?
I don't know, but whoever it was,
they had no problem blowing us up.
Check with April-- maybe there's
a way we can test the food.
Well, what if there isn't?
In the meantime, we tell everybody who's
handling this stuff to put gloves on first
and we don't hand out to anybody
until we're sure it's safe.
We may not have that choice.
Folks, let's calm down.
Hey! Hey!
Back it up right now!
- Everybody, drop what you have
and take a step back!
- Bill!
Put that damn gun away now!
Get this area cordoned off!
Don't do this, people.
This is Jericho.
This is not some third-world village.
We got no power, no phones, no gas.
We may not be the third world,
but we're getting there.
We need food now.
- Folks, we don't know what is safe
and what is not safe. - The only
people I've seen trying to hurt
us have been out on that road
and they look a lot like you and me.
This looks like help, and I say we take it.
- Are you okay?
- I am great! Come on.
- So you know we're not being attacked?
- Yeah, of course.
I do talk to the neighbors, you know.
Why are you so happy?
Because we have chocolate.
That stuff wasn't half bad,
and I'm still alive.
The only thing that proved
is that you're clinically stupid.
- When are you going to hand out
that food, Johnston?
- We are not having that debate here.
What, should we have
it in your office again?
Maybe this time I sucker punch you.
Listen, if you're still breathing this time
tomorrow, maybe we'll distribute this stuff.
In the meantime, do the town a favor and
forget you want my job for one second.
- Seemed to be in every box.
- Yeah.
Could this mean we're
gonna be conquered?
- It doesn't say that.
- "Do not fight"?
It could be the price we pay for free food.
- That's it. - All I know is that between
the stunt Gray's pulling and these flyers,
we could have a problem keeping order.
Is this all of the pallets?
Almost.
They're numbered one through 12.
One through five is food
and this dried fish stuff.
Six and eight:
we got medical supplies, water.
Ten, 11, 12: grain, blankets, and fuel.
That leaves seven and nine.
They're still missing,
but we got people looking for them.
- We need to get this stuff off the street
before there's nothing left to protect.
- Yeah, you're right.
My customers need that.
You are taking everything.
With those air drops, there's no telling
what's out there to trade.
We got to be ready.
Well, what about me?
We had a deal, Jonah.
You'd bring me things,
and I give you a cut.
Now you just take.
Mitchell Cafferty, that is not yours.
Whoa, whoa, easy, big fella.
Take it easy.
Gracie...
Mitchell and the other guys
don't see our arrangement the way I do.
If it were up to them, they'd just come
in here and snap your neck.
But I don't want to see that happen.
Let's go.
Long time, no see, Johnston.
It was supposed to be longer.
Gracie, we got all this food out here.
We sure could use a place to distribute it.
Only thing is, you'd have to stop
doing business with Jonah.
We have a deal.
Had a deal... the one you broke.
I'm in.
That stays.
And this.
Come on. Come on.
It's good to have you back, Mayor Green.
Well, those prices you've been charging,
those are going to have to stop.
Hey, look,
we just need a place to store the food.
- Well, how am I going to make...? - Hey,
if you don't like it, there's always Jonah.
I like it.
Well, in that case, it's good to
have you back, too, Gracie.
Look.
Isn't it great?
Hey, hey, hey,
you don't know if that's okay.
- Well, it's not Teuscher, but in a pinch...
- I mean, you don't know if it's safe.
Well, if the chocolate didn't impress you,
maybe this will.
- It's a generator. - So we can get
power back and communications.
- Listen, take my truck and go tell Jake.
- But do we have to give up all the food?
It's not our food; it's the town's food.
You mean, the town that was going to
blow that bridge and leave us for dead?
That town?
A: They didn't blow up the bridge,
and B: you were on the
other side of it at the time.
Take the truck and go tell Jake.
We're not sharing the chocolate.
- And we can fit all the food into
Gracie's store. - Good, good.
Regarding the medical supplies,
would you guys mind, um...?
I'll go to the clinic and give them to April.
Thank you.
So, are we going to see
you for Thanksgiving?
I think Mary and I are
going to spend it together.
Well, you're always welcome.
Football starts at 3:00.
Thanks, but I don't want to put you guys
in an awkward position.
You could have thought of that
before you moved in with your
mistress and left your wife with us.
- I'd better get back to Main Street.
- Thanks, son.
Yeah, now it feels like the holidays.
- Why do you keep acting
like it's no big deal? - I don't.
- I'm also trying not to act like a hypocrite.
- Oh...
- This is nothing like what
we went through. - Oh, no?
I seem to recall when my mother thought
your name was "the other woman."
And I ignored her just the way
Eric's ignoring us.
Now, if this is so different,
I'm not seeing it.
It is different, because we were
barely in our 20s
she wasn't your wife...
...and she wasn't pregnant.
April's pregnant.
She's a few months along.
Does Eric know?
April made me promise not to tell him.
So, then, um, you're mad at Eric over
something he doesn't even know about?
That bag of rice could
feed this whole crowd.
They'd like to know when
they're gonna see some of it.
Well, odd as it might seem to you, Gray,
we're trying come up with a plan
to distribute this stuff fairly.
It might have to last
us through the winter.
Through the winter?
- My family's hungry now, not when you
decide it's okay for them to be hungry.
- This might be the last food we get.
- Yeah? Well, we're not getting it, Jake,
you are. - Look, we're hungry, too, Bill!
Bill, nobody here is taking anything.
If you'll just wait, you'll find there's
plenty of this to go around.
It may come as a surprise to
some of you Greens, but many
of us can think for ourselves.
It is like Filene's Basement out here.
- Oh, never mind.
- Where's Stanley?
- He's back at the farm.
- We found two more parachutes.
One of them has a generator.
What are we doing here?
Where is it?
Well, it was right here.
Let's try this way.
Oh, my God.
Stanley.
- Hey, what happened?
- Jonah...
Nobody grabs a gun until we have a plan.
- Jonah could have killed Stanley.
- But he didn't.
And I'm not getting us into a firefight
unless I can get us out--
all of us.
Look, why don't I go down there with
Jimmy and Bill and talk to them.
Uh, all due respect, Eric...
hell no.
Look, Jonah knows he's outnumbered.
If we let him know our intent,
he will listen to reason.
Yeah, let's talk to him, 'cause that's
worked out so well in the past.
- If you'd shut Jonah down when I told
you to, we wouldn't be having this
conversation. - We need that generator.
Without it we're stuck in the 1800s,
and the longer we wait, the longer
Jonah has to hide it or to trade it off.
- It's now or not at all. - Nobody moves
on the compound unless I say so.
Nobody shoots unless I say so.
Are we clear?
Yes, sir.
All right then, let's load up.
- I'll take Jimmy and Bill...
- You sit this one out, Gray.
I have Jonah to worry about.
I don't need somebody
shooting me in the back.
Maybe Dad will be home in time
for our first Christmas together.
- He'll be here.
Won't he, Mom?
- Yes, he will.
You know what I'm most thankful for?
Being reminded of how many
excuses you always made for him.
Doctor said no concussion, so...
That thick skull of yours
finally came in handy.
- Where do you think you're going?
- After Jonah.
- No, you aren't.
Stanley, please don't go.
Stanley, if anything happened to you...
Think of Bonnie.
- Where you going?
- To get the generator.
- From Jonah?
- Yeah.
- Slow down-- we can think
of a better way. - It's too late.
Even if you get the generator, it
won't end there.
If you push my father,
Jake, he'll push back.
What do you want me to do?
I've got Jonah.
What about those pallets?
- I don't see them.
- Maybe they're gone already.
Maybe not.
They're on that flatbed.
Okay.
Jonah.
Johnston.
Give us the generator,
you can keep everything else.
I've got no idea what you're talking about.
Let's take a look around,
I'll show you.
Sorry. Private property still
means something out here.
Now, if I still had a way of making a living
at Gracie's market...
this might be a different conversation.
Open the gate or we're coming through.
Those supplies dropped for everyone,
not just you.
You don't get to decide for the rest of us.
I'm looking out for the whole town,
what about you?
Who the hell do you think saved
Jericho from those mercenaries?
I'm hanging on to the genny.
We'll call it even.
This doesn't end well
for either of us, Jonah.
Let's get ready.
He's taking the genny!
He's taking the truck out!
- Who the hell...?
- Hold it, don't shoot.
What the hell were you thinking?
That you could have gotten killed,
and Jonah wouldn't have hurt me.
What?
- What about Mitchell?
- He almost shot you.
- Hell, we almost shot you.
- But you didn't, Jake.
- God, when we were in high school you
would have been right there with me.
- We're not kids anymore.
Why don't you just say, "good job"?
- What...? No.
- I know it's what you're thinking.
- I'll put these back on my way out.
- Wait up, son.
I got to go--
I told Mary I'd be back an hour ago.
Well, she's waited this long,
she can wait five more minutes.
Grab a chair.
Now, son,
we both know that marriage is hard.
It's a little late for this speech, Dad.
Fine. I'll just fast-forward to the next one.
Fatherhood is harder.
- What are you talking about?
- April's pregnant.
I just found out myself.
And I got to hear this from you?
Well, I shouldn't be the one telling you.
I'll probably be in the doghouse
till next Thanksgiving
but I thought you ought to know.
- Well, I had no idea.
- Now you do.
And now you need to do the right thing.
- I have, Dad. I tried to work
things out with April. - Try harder.
Look, a bad marriage doesn't get
better because you add a kid.
No.
No, it doesn't,
but you are going to have to stop thinking
about yourself first.
You give up that right when you
bring a child into this world.
Son, you and April had the bad luck to
fall out of love at the same time
but you can get that back.
You're not hearing me, Dad.
I don't think I ever loved April.
I love Mary.
And I have to trust that.
My old friend iodine.
Okay, so what do I do here?
Just, um, dab the cotton ball in the iodine.
Put the cotton ball on the cut.
Ow!
- Gently, please.
- I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this.
- You know, I'm going to be okay, so...
- No, the doctor said that we had to
clean the wounds twice a day.
So come on, please, off with the shirt.
What do I got to close my eyes?
Oh, my God.
- You're, uh...
- What?
You're blushing.
It's a reaction to the iodine, okay?
- Ow! - I think it's a reaction to
having your shirt off in front
of me. - Don't flatter yourself.
Come on, come on, I'm not done.
Please, off with the shirt.
You know, I'd guess a lot of things
about you
but being shy in front of
women wasn't one of them.
If, we're... if we're going to do this, can we
at least talk about something else please?
- Like what?
- I don't know...
What do you usually do on Thanksgiving?
My mom and I go to
a resort in Punta Mita.
- That's Mexico.
- Hmm.
Why?
What do you do?
Uh... watch football, eat turkey,
take a nap, like everybody else I guess.
Well, you're missing out.
Lounging by the infinity pool
watching the surfer boys and sipping
what most experts would agree is
the world's finest mango margarita.
Sounds fun.
Un-American, but fun.
It was.
You're all set.
Sorry you had to suffer through that.
What's the plan, Jonah?
The day I have to answer to you, Mitchell,
we're in deeper trouble than I thought.
You don't have to answer to me.
You have to answer to them.
Hey, I always find a way.
Not today you didn't.
- They outplayed us... once.
It happens.
- No, they didn't outplay us...
she outplayed you.
Are you mad that I didn't
let you take the shot?
- That I didn't let you kill my daughter?
- You're getting soft, Jonah.
- And your mistakes are costing us.
- Saving Emily was no mistake.
What about letting Mayor Green kick
you out of town?
I mean, come on, for God...
You were taking orders from
Gracie Leigh this morning.
Hey, all you need to remember is I'm the
guy that keeps saving your ass.
You think you can do
a better job than me?
You going to make your move?
I didn't think so.
Let's go.
You think we should hold
on to these parachutes?
- I mean, they're pretty trashed.
- Why not?
You can make some of those pants
you used to wear in high school.
Hey.
What's that?
It looks like a microchip.
What's it for?
I don't know.
But I know who to ask.
They're called RFIDs--
Radio Frequency Identifiers.
- It's like a bar code, right?
- Yeah.
You know, if we had the right equipment,
we could find out who sent 'em here.
How do you know about this, Mr. Hawkins?
I read a lot, Eric.
Why are they in the chutes?
They're used for tracking
inventory, mostly by big global
companies and by one military.
- China?
- No, the U.S.
These chutes, they're from our air force.
Let me get this straight now--
we're talking about Vietnam-era
planes flying through Kansas
airspace doing a Chinese drop
and they're using U.S. Air
Force equipment to do it.
Sounds about right.
- In what world does that make sense?
- Ours.
Stanley?
- Stanley?
- In the kitchen.
You are not supposed to be up.
- You know what?
- I-I don't have a turkey, but, uh...
I do have tequila.
What about mangoes?
You know, I've never seen a mango.
- But... I have Tang.
- Instant Tang?
So in honor of your, um,
first Thanksgiving here in Jericho
I've made what some critics
believe to be the world's finest...
Tang-o margaritas.
Oh, that's awesome.
- Hey, listen, your father's not a
hundred percent, so no roughing
up the passer. - Are you kidding?
- What?
- All of it-- I mean, the football,
the Thanksgiving dinner, I mean...
- What about it? - Well, we're just
holding on to these... these traditions
like nothing happened out there?
We're holding on to these traditions
because of what happened out there.
Oh, son!
Good to see you made it.
Yeah. I'm not staying.
I was wondering if I could talk to April.
Sure.
So... it's over.
Yeah.
When were you planning on
telling me about the baby?
When I knew it wouldn't
affect your decision.
I didn't want you to stay with
me because of the baby, Eric.
- Well, I think we're the only two
people that agree on that.
- Great.
Why did you come here?
I came here to tell you that I'm sorry
for what I did
but I can't live a lie anymore.
And I'll do whatever it takes
to take care of that baby.
Why should I believe you?
You don't have to believe me.
I'll just be there.
- I think that's it.
- How do we know this thing isn't
some kind of bomb?
Well, Gray's still alive, so let's risk it, huh?
Thanks for your help, Mr. Hawkins.
- Sorry to take you away on Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.
Hey, you know what, Bill?
Could you hold off?
Just give me ten minutes.
No problem.
Thanks.
Guess we have one less dish to wash.
Did you know about all this?
Eric and Mary?
You don't have to answer that.
I knew a little.
Think it'll work out?
He says she makes him happy.
Well, what about when she doesn't make
him happy, he's gonna leave her, too?
- Dad, it's not your problem.
- I know, I know, it's just...
- my one goal when I was raising you boys
was that even when things got tough you
made the right choices. - Hi, Emily. - Hey.
Glad you could make it.
You missed the football.
I didn't want to show Jake up.
- Really.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, Jake, honey, put Emily next to you.
Thank you.
God, I hope April has a girl.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, that might've flown two hours ago.
I know.
I know, but, uh...
Wait.
Look, um, will you come with me?
There's, uh,
something I want to show you.
Please, D.
Hey, Bill.
Thanks. Go ahead.
You believe that?
Wow!
See, uh...
this is what Daddy did at work today.
Bye, Gracie.
usly onJericho:
<i>All right, it looks like</i>
<i>the explosion</i>
came from the west,
maybe Denver.
<i>Maybe one of you</i>
<i>would like to tell me</i>
just exactly who you
think is in charge here.
<i>Gray's finally getting</i>
<i>that election, huh?</i>
Is the mayor nervous?
Not as nervous as he should be.
You're blushing.
It's a reaction
to the iodine, okay?
It's a reaction to having your
shirt off in front of me.
Did you steal
from me, Dale?
After everything
I have done for you?
Everything you've done for me?
You wouldn't have a store
if it wasn't for me.
Where are you going?
To get the
generator.
From Jonah?
Yeah.
Even if you get a generator,
it won't end there.
<i>If you push my father,</i>
<i>Jake,he'll push back.</i>
Mitchell Cafferty,
that is not yours!
Whoa, easy, big fella.
Mitchell and the other guys
don't see our arrangement
the way I do.
<i>Gracie, we've got all</i>
<i>this food out here.</i>
We sure could use
a place to distribute it.
You'd have to stop doing
business with Jonah.
GRACIE:
I'm in.
SAMUEL:
Dad! I need you.
Right now!
Dad!
Hey.
What you got there?
A football.
Yeah, yeah.
I know that.
What's it for?
You have to
teach me to play.
Why?
'Cause I don't know how.
Well, I'm not
sure I know how.
Okay, okay, uh...
I know a little.
Come on.
What, this is something that
has to be done right now?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, what are you doing?
Putting a hand
pump on this well,
so we don't have to waste
generator power for water.
There's really
a well under there?
First well in Jericho,
according to the sign.
I remember another
first that happened right there.
You shouldn't have dared me.
Nobody had to dare you.
Yeah, well, I remember
one of your finer moments.
Right over there,
behind Bailey's.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, let's not
talk about that.
I could get sick right here.
Some people can't hold their
apple wine coolers.
No. No.
You kept singing that
depressing song
by that uh, that bald girl.
Sinead O'Connor,
and that was our song.
Our song?
I never got to vote.
Hey, um, let's-let's talk about
what happened right there.
The day you went to
get medicine for your dad.
Heather kissed you.
She talked to me about it.
Yeah, I-I don't want
her to get hurt.
I have no plans to do that.
Mrs. Leigh?
Mrs. Leigh!
Mrs. Leigh.
Oh, Gracie!
(sobbing):
No!
Dad.
Do we know who did this?
No witnesses.
She was already gone
by the time Dale found her.
Sure Dale didn't kill her?
The blood on the floor
has been drying for a long time.
And that boy is incapable
of doing something like that.
Nobody is incapable
under the right circumstances.
JIMMY:
Mayor Green, Mitchell Cafferty
has something to tell you.
What the hell...
You back off!
Easy.
Jonah said he killed her,
but I didn't believe him.
Jonah Prowse
said he did this?
Jonah showed up at the compound,
and his arm was all torn up.
He said that he killed Gracie
because she wouldn't do
business with him anymore.
He was trying to prove to me
and the rest of the guys
that he was
still in charge.
Where's Jonah now?
I don't know.
He hit me with
a tire iron,
I just saw
him driving off.
You believe this guy, Johnston?
He broke out of our jail.
He's a fugitive.
Listen, I wouldn't blame you
if you locked me up right now.
But if you want any help
tracking down Jonah,
I'm ready.
Eric, why don't you
talk to Mitch here?
See if he can help.
Let's go.
This guy is a
criminal, Johnston.
Yeah, I know what he is.
I'm trying to figure
out what he knows.
We can arrest him anytime.
We just had our first
murder in 30 years.
And I've been mayor of this
town for 25 of those years!
Maybe that's the problem.
You still think Jericho's
the same sweet little town,
it was before the bombs.
We need somebody
who understands...
Save it for
the election, Gray.
This is what the
election is about!
You want to get this civilian
off the crime scene?
Just tell me the
name of the song.
If you don't remember,
I'm not telling you.
I remember it was
sad and depressing.
You must not remember
our relationship.
It's a great house.
Yeah, thanks.
The first one Roger
and I looked at.
We made an offer immediately.
Well, when you know what
you want, why keep looking?
Thanks for walking me home.
Thanks for helping
with the well.
Bye.
Shh!
Shh-shh-shh.
Don't say a word.
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:XXY
Sync:FRM@openext</font>
I just heard.
I'm so sorry, Dale.
The only lead we have
to go on right now
is that Mitchell Cafferty
said Jonah confessed.
Mitch is not much of a witness.
I was there yesterday,
when Gracie stood up to Jonah.
She said she wasn't going to
do business with him anymore.
He couldn't have been
too happy about that.
All right. We need to pull a
couple of guys off of patrol
and go find them.
If Jonah did this,
 he is not going to come in willingly.
I'm coming, too.
No, Dale.
I know how to shoot a gun.
Son, the last thing you need
to be doing right now
is waving a gun around at the
man you think killed Gracie.
He did it.
You said yourself she stood up
to Jonah, and now she's dead.
You're not going, Dale.
There's something that
I have to talk to you about.
Gray's going to use this
for all it's worth, Dad.
A lot of people are starting to listen to him.
Well,you listen to me.
I've known Gracie all my life.
We're going to find
the man who did this.
We're going to bring
him to justice.
And I do not want
to hear another word
about this election.
Yes, sir.
Any news on Jonah?
No, no one in here has seen him.
Jonah better hope that
Gray doesn't find him.
He says he's going to make
an example out of him.
What's he going to do,
string him up?
You can't kill someone in
the middle of Main Street.
Yeah?
Tell that to Gracie Leigh.
Gray came back from
Topeka a changed man.
He's not messing around.
And I, for one, think
he's got the right idea.
W-wait a minute.
You're not voting
for Gray Anderson?
I'm not going to answer that.
This is still America.
Yeah, just barely.
MIMI:
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Okay, that was good.
Um... let's try again.
What was good
about that?
I don't know.
Just pick up
the ball.
Why can't you throw it
to somebody else
when they're chasing you?
I don't know what you mean.
When they're chasing you.
When who is
chasing who, son?
The guys
that want the ball.
God, why do you suck at this?
Hey, you got
to watch your mouth.
Hey, it's too cold for you to be
out here playing
without jackets.
How's it going?
Not so well.
I need to get back to work.
Son, the trick is
the grip,
all right?
Put your little finger
and your ring finger...
no, this one.
Yeah, it should go
on the white stripe.
Thumb goes
underneath it.
Okay? And just go...
just-just throw
it to me.
Okay?
All right.
There's nothing
wrong with that.
Hey, I thought basketball
was your game.
They're kind of all my games.
Hey, Jake.
Need your help.
I'll be right there.
So, where we going?
Jonah's compound.
My dad and Eric
are meeting us there.
You think he's still out there.
I think he doesn't have
a lot of places to hide
or a lot of people
to turn to.
Well, he must have some other
friends in town or maybe family.
Hold on.
What if they can't find him?
He can't just get away
with this.
They'll find him.
What am I supposed to do?
Sit down, Dale.
There's some things
you need to know.
Come on.
After the bombs
went off and
your mother died,
Gracie changed her will.
She left her store to you.
I was the witness.
The papers are in a locked box
at the bank along with the keys.
Nobody expects a 16-year-old boy
to run that business.
You need to take
some time
and think about what
you're going to do
with all this.
I'll be there if you need me.
I can't take her store.
I quit.
I called her a liar.
I said the worst things...
That happens in families.
People get mad,
say things.
But that doesn't erase
everything that came before.
Gracie loved you.
And she wanted you
to have her store.
Come on, guys,
check around back.
Whoa, whoa, what
are you doing, Gray?
Manhunt, same as you.
Got to thinking that
Jonah might be coming
to Emily for sympathy.
We can handle this.
Yeah? Who's that?
Those of us who have been
training to protect this town.
You're doing a hell
of a job.
This is dangerous, Gray.
We can't just have a bunch of
vigilantes running around town.
It's a little late for that.
I've seen two other
truckloads of guys
running around
this neighborhood.
The town is heading
towards chaos.
It's not going to calm down till
somebody finds Jonah Prowse.
What's going on?
We're looking for Jonah Prowse.
He killed Gracie Leigh.
Since he's your father...
Not in any way that matters.
Well, we'd like to look
around a little bit.
No.
She wouldn't hide him, Gray.
We're going to look around
a little bit
and then we'll be gone.
Hey.
There's no sign of him
in the backyard.
That's good news.
Come on, I'll patrol
with you for a while.
Let's go, Gray.
Watch this house.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Where is he?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You didn't even blink when
you heard about Gracie.
Where is he?
Jake...
I didn't kill Gracie Leigh.
Then why are you holding
us at gunpoint?
'Cause maybe
you won't believe me.
Maybe you'll try
and be some kind of hero
and take me in.
He's bleeding.
He needs a doctor, Jake.
JONAH:
I'm not going
into town.
Jake, you're going to help
me get out of here.
I'm not helping you
do anything.
For all I know,
you're a murderer.
I didn't do it!
I walked out this morning--
found myself surrounded
by my own men.
Mitchell Cafferty's there.
He tells me Gracie Leigh's
been murdered.
When I asked him who did it,
Mitchell says to me, "You did.
And I saw the whole thing."
Before
I knew it,
he's got a knife on me.
And he sliced my arm open.
But I took a crowbar to him
before he could finish the job.
Your guys sided
with Mitch?
It didn't sit too well with them
that my little girl
stole our haul
from the food drop
and I stopped Mitchell Cafferty
from putting a bullet
in her brain.
So they did this to you
because you wouldn't kill me?
Okay, okay, okay.
Get him up.
(groans)
We got to take him in.
But we got to be careful.
There are a lot
of people out there
who would rather shoot first
and ask questions later.
Mitchell will keep coming
until he kills me.
We'll take him
to Town Hall.
You'll be safe there.
Those guys will walk
right in that jail...
and kill me and anyone else
who gets in their...
What'd you come here for, huh?
You put your own
daughter at risk...
Shut up!
Just get him... just get him
a doctor.
Okay, okay
Dale.
Hey.
What happened?
She was murdered... stabbed.
Dale...
Dale!
I just heard.
SEAN:
You the one
who found her?
Yeah.
Open the place up.
Let's have some fun.
Back off, Sean.
What do you care?
It's not your store.
Yeah, it is.
All of it.
What are you talking about?
Gracie gave it to me.
Worked out for you
then, huh?
Dale...
Stop it.
You're lucky I don't
take you out right here.
SKYLAR:
Get out of here, Sean.
Sean, you all right?
Come on, get out.
See you around?
Hey.
Did you find
the guy?
No, no, not yet.
Um, look, I got
to check on something
in the basement,
and then I'm going back
out there with Gray
and his men...
Between that basement
and all the men with guns...
Hey.
What's wrong?
Robert, is this what we have
to look forward to?
People showing up,
you grabbing that damn gun
and running off?
It's not all that different
than before.
Yeah, that worked out so well
for us, didn't it?
So when are we going
to lose you?
Lose me?
I don't know that you are.
The kids are getting used
to having you here.
Yeah?
What about you, D?
Me, too.
I don't want to go anywhere.
I like being here.
You lock the basement--
or you tell those
men to fight their own
battles and stay home.
The damn world ended.
Can't you just be with us?
Kenchy, I need you
to come with me.
Where?
I'll tell you on the
way to the medical
center, all right?
Look, we need some supplies.
Oh... you want me
to kill someone?
You need a real doctor,
my friend.
A real doctor wouldn't do
what I need done.
Come on.
Let's go.
How bad is it?
Well, whoever did this
used a serrated edge.
We could have done
without that.
Did you stop the bleeding?
Mostly.
I gave him a shot
for the pain.
Probably fall asleep now.
Is this the guy?
The murderer everybody's
talking about?
He says no.
Oh, no one's going
to believe him.
They're
out for blood.
He's not going to get
a fair shake.
Yes, he will.
I'll go get my dad.
He can bring him in, make sure
things are done the right way.
It's Jonah's only chance.
Okay.
All right.
Lock the door.
Mind if I wash
my hands?
We're not safe.
Gracie's death makes
that all too clear.
I tell you what, Mary.
The chaos I saw when I was
fighting my way back home
to Jericho, well now,
it's right here
on our Main Street.
Criminals like Jonah Prowse
think we're easy targets now.
Well, I'll tell
you what, Neil.
I think we should go
find Jonah Prowse
and make an example of him.
And he shouldn't get
to sit around for 15 years
before he gets
what's coming to him.
We got to send
a message.
(murmured assent)
Crime will
not be tolerated.
We are willing
to do whatever it takes
to keep Jericho safe.
So please remember
at the polls tomorrow...
Dad, I need your help.
...to vote Gray Anderson
for a new Jericho.
Watch it.
Sorry about that, Ma.
Oh, no, no.
We are not doing that.
Come on, now.
You can call me Pa.
Seriously, that
really creeps me out.
Good creepy
or bad creepy?
What?
Look.
What we did...
it's not what you think.
I had a weak moment.
It was a mistake.
Well, I'm really good
at making mistakes.
Yes, you are.
Believe me, it was
a pleasant surprise,
but we can't
do this anymore.
Because of Bonnie?
Yeah, I'll talk to her.
She'll be fine.
Do you know how many
second dates I've had
in the last
five years?
I'm guessing not many.
And do you know why?
Yeah, because you're obnoxious
and demanding and
totally self-absorbed.
Yeah.
And you are sweet, simple
and bull-headed.
You can't handle
someone like me.
This will never work.
Ah, that's what they said
about Brangelina.
Are you seriously quoting
<i>Us</i> magazine right now?
Yeah, what do you think
they'd call us?
Stimiley?
Mimiley?
St...
Stimi.
You are such an idiot.
You're harboring
a criminal, Jake.
He's hurt.
And he needed a doctor,
so I got one,
and then I came to you.
Well, we have got us one
hell of a problem, Jake,
because if anyone knows
that you've been hiding
Jonah Prowse
while the whole town
has been out looking for him,
they'll throw us all in jail.
Jonah says Mitchell
killed Gracie
and then he
set him up.
What do you think?
He might be telling the truth.
You're not a judge or a jury.
Now, we're gonna go get him,
we're gonna bring him in...
Good, that's what
I came here for!
Well, you better hope...
He's gone.
Let's get him!
Come on!
That's him!
Let's get him!
Well, well...
Jonah Prowse.
Can't get away
from us, huh?
Pick him up!
Get him up, guys.
All right, let's go.
Get out of the truck.
Do you solemnly swear
to uphold the laws
of the State of Kansas
and faithfully discharge
the duties of Mayor?
I do.
Congratulations.
Friends, thank you for
placing your trust in me
to lead Jericho
through this difficult time.
This town belongs
to all of us
and we must work
together to survive.
The resources of this town
also belong to all of us,
and therefore, as my first
official act as Mayor,
I am ordering the food
from the food drop
to be distributed immediately.
And now,
to the subject of security.
One of our citizens
was brutally murdered.
But her murderer will be
held to account.
Justice will be swift and sure,
you have my word.
Don't take that too serious.
They're not calling for
your head on a platter.
Why'd you run?
My father was going
to bring you in...
Your father just got
shown the door, Jake.
I didn't want this
to happen.
Jonah made his own bed.
I'm sorry your dad
lost the election.
I feel if I hadn't
gotten you involved...
No.
The people spoke, and they got
exactly what they wanted.
What do you want,
Mitchell?
Just visiting.
Hey, sweetie?
Do you mind giving me
and my man here
a little privacy?
It's okay.
I'll be back in a second.
So I hear you and I are
going to be partners now.
Where'd you get that?
Well, you're running the store,
you're gonna need protection.
From who?
Jonah's in jail.
This has nothing
to do with Jonah.
Don't make the same
mistake that Gracie made.
I get half the cut.
Or those people out there
are going to be putting
flowers and candles on
the sidewalk for you.
Okay?
See you tomorrow...
and the next day.
And the next day.
Are you knitting?
Yeah, it's one of the few things
that ever just zoned me out.
I learned in
the dorm at Vassar.
Not so hot for me now, are you?
No, it's just, um...
Actually, I think that
belonged to my mother.
Oh, my God.
I am... so sorry.
I found it half finished
in a trunk upstairs.
It's okay.
No, no, no.
I'll-I'll put it back.
No, no, no.
I think...
I think you should finish it.
No, I couldn't.
Look, it's okay.
I actually think my mother
would have liked you.
Really?
No, not at all.
Manley.
Our tabloid name.
Mimi and Stanley. Manley.
Is that <i>really</i> the message you
want to be putting out there?
You're right.
Good point.
Stimi's better.
Dad...
We're going
to have to...
take down all
these posters.
Get this place
back to normal.
I don't think normal's
where we're headed.
(chuckles):
Yeah.
I, uh...
I'm sorry.
So am I.
DALE:
Mayor!
Mitchell Cafferty did it.
What?
He killed Gracie.
What are you
talking about, Dale?
He said if I
refuse to give him a cut of the
store, he'd do to me
what he did to Gracie.
Let's find Gray.
All right, Jonah.
Get up. Let's go.
Let's go.
Where you taking me?
You'll find out
when we get there.
JOHNSTON:
Gray, what
are you doing?
We're moving him to
a more secure location.
There's a lot of folks
who want to rip him
apart after what he did.
We don't know what he did.
He hasn't had a trial yet.
Well, these are special
circumstances, Johnston.
We don't have a judge.
As mayor, I formed
a tribunal, and
he was found guilty.
You did what?
Mitch just told Dale that
he would do to him
what he did to Gracie
if he didn't go along with him.
Well, did anyone else
hear him say that?
No.
That's hardly proof.
What? You think I'm
lying? I'm not lying.
GRAY: He was trying
to intimidate you.
It doesn't mean
he actually did it.
JAKE:
This is unbelievable.
You don't even care
who killed her.
You just want Jonah.
I've got Jonah!
He's innocent.
He's far
from innocent!
He's been preying on
this town for years!
From now on,
guys like him
go away! We don't coddle them,
we don't make deals with them.
JAKE:
What are you planning
on doing, Gray?
You going to kl him
in cold blood?
Say he tried to escape
while moving him to
a secure location?
Who's going to do it?
Bill?
You gonna
put a bullet
in Jonah's head when Gray
tells you to?
I'm not shooting anybody.
It's up to you, Gray.
Go on.
No?
This is what you want,right?
You make the rules?
Decide who lives and dies?
Go ahead
and do it.
But you do it here,
in front of me and Dale.
In front of everyone.
Not... not in some
back room with your buddies.
Don't let someone else do
the dirty work for you, Mayor.
You want him dead?
You take this gun
and blow his
brains out.
Gray, no.
You better
be damn sure he's guilty.
Because if he's not,
you're a murderer,
and justice
will be swift.
HNSTON:
<i>Jonah agrees to leave town</i>
and not come back.
Exile.
Worked for the Greeks.
The town gets
rid of Jonah Prowse,
and you get to save face.
All right.
Now, what about Mitchell
Cafferty?
Why don't you
let me handle that?
Look, um... Johnston,
I love this town.
I just want to keep it safe.
Like it always was.
What it always was
is a democracy.
That's easy when things
are going all right.
But when you're scared or mad,
it gets to be a lot harder.
I'll try to watch
out for that.
Oh, I think
we'll all be watching.
You know, my father--
your grandfather--
he was a... he was
an excellent athlete.
You know?
I mean, all sports, Sam.
He won lots of awards
when he was in school.
But the thing is,
when I was
your age,
he was in the Air Force,
and he was gone a lot,
and he didn't have time
to teach me much, so...
Sam, that's why
I suck at football.
Me, too.
I'm sorry about that, son.
Yeah.
Oh, here she comes.
Come on. Okay?
Come on.
Ready?
Hut!
You practice hard.
There you go, Coach.
Hey, hey.
I'm here.
Okay? Right here.
Robert!
Hey, isn't that what
football players do
to each other?
This will keep you warm.
Emily, when
Chris was born...
Don't.
When Chris was born,
you were four years old.
Your mother said she
wanted a clean break.
I was into
some bad stuff,
and she didn't
want you and Chris
growing up in it,
so I let her go.
But I didn't want to.
She never got over you.
We loved each other.
It was like...
Like you and Jake.
Don't blame Jake for
your brother's death.
That's on me.
I pushed Chris
to do that job.
He wasn't ready. He wasn't
cut out for that kind of life.
Jake wanted out.
I didn't understand
that then,
but I sure do now.
That boy still loves you.
Don't you have a
curfew or something?
No.
Cool.
So this is what
you've been saving
your generator
rations for.
Nice music, Mary.
I'll have cold coffee
and candles the rest of my life
if I can just have
music now and then.
You know
I love you, right?
Yes.
Hey.
Hey.
How did it go?
He's gone.
It's the best thing for now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You don't suppose they have any
of those apple wine coolers
back there, do you?
Feel like talking, huh?
No. Just the opposite.
Hey, Mary,
can we get
two more of whatever
it is you're pouring?
It almost looks
normal in here.
Like the bombs
never even happened.
Let's stay in here
as long as we can, huh?
* It's been seven hours
and 15 days... *
Finally remembered
the name of that song.
Mary had it
on the jukebox.
* Since you been gone *
Come on.
Come on!
* I can do whatever I want *
* I can see whoever I choose *
* I can eat my dinner
in a fancy restaurant *
* But nothing *
* I said, nothing
can take away these blues *
* 'Cause nothing compares *
* Nothing compares to you... *
What about Heather?
What about Roger?
You know how this goes.
We should be grown-ups,
and walk away right now.
You're right.
We should.
* Like a bird without a song *
* I know that living with you,
baby, was sometimes hard *
* But I'm willing
to give it another try... *
ERIC:
Jake!
Jake, we got
to go outside. Now!
Let's go.
* Nothing compares... *
They need help.
Take them inside.
Jake!
Some of them were
on planes that landed
in the middle
of nowhere.
They've been
walking for weeks.
They must have
gone through hell.
Oh, my God!
Roger.
Who the hell is that?
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to www.1000fr.com</font>
Nice planes.
Yeah, every aircraft
we operate is augmented
with custom security
and design features
you won't find
in any other fleet.
I see that you're
an Embry-Riddle grad.
ATP-certified,
1,600 verified FAA hours.
Clearly well qualified,
Mr. Green.
Flying's in my blood.
I started working on my Grandpa's
crop duster when I was 10.
Now you understand
that we charter
exclusively
to top executives
and celebrity clients,
so absolute discretion
is a must for our flight crew.
Hey, anything past
getting the plane
safely from "A to "B"
is none of my business.
Good, of course, finding
out everything we can
about the people who are piloting
our planes is our business.
And according
to your visa records,
you spent a little time in the
Middle East over the last few years.
14 months in Afghanistan, 6 in Iraq.
But you were never military?
I worked for an
independent contractor.
Left that off the resum.
I didn't think
it was relevant.
State Department has you
flagged as a person of interest.
I'm an interesting guy.
There was an incident.
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
Which contractor
were you working with
when this
incident occurred?
One of the big ones.
- Halliburton, Blackwater?
- You said discretion was a must.
Look, I'm going to be straight with you.
I think there's room in our operation
for someone like you,
but there is no way
that I can hire you if you
are unable to clear this up.
Do you understand that?
Thank you for your time.
<i>The president is scheduled

This is good news.
We talking locally

It was your idea.
I have to say that...

I thought I was prepared

But nothing like this.
Well, that's because

This is it.
Yes.

Season 1 Episode 12
"The Day Before"
Transcript: swsub.com
Synchro: Loky
[ www.seriessub.com ]
- Hey, Dad, you got a second?
- Nope.
USA Today's having a contest
to find the top five
towns under 5,000.
I was thinking we
should submit Jericho.
Why, so some big
developer can come in
and start buying
the town up,
maybe turn Main Street
into a strip mall
with a half a dozen
coffee shops or so?
Dad, there are worse things in the world
- than vente frappuccinos.
- Speak English.
This could be a good thing.
The kind of headlines
that will bring out voters next month.
Son, I am not worried
about beating Gray Anderson.
The people of this town
have kept me in office
for over 20 years.
I will earn their votes
by doing the job
they hired me to do.
What are you guys doing here?
Your father missed
his checkup this morning
and April was nice enough
to take off
her lunch hour
to make a house call.
Well, sorry, Doc, but we're
gonna have to reschedule
- for sometime after the election.
- Johnston.
You're gonna do this
whether you like it or not.
I've had this terrible cold
and you've not been feeling
well for almost a week.
It's a bad one.
Half my staff
has come down with it.
Do you want to strip here
or would you like to go
somewhere a little less public?
My office.
That's my guy.
Yo, yo, how'd it go?
Well, Freddy...
so much for your lucky tie.
"Driver wanted.
Military experience.
Plus, travel opportunities."
Something tells me they're not
talking about the Bahamas.
I need a job.
You're no driver, man.
You're a pilot,
a freakin' good one.
Right now, all I am is broke.
Unless you want
to pay my rent for me.
Sorry?!
Tell you what I can do, though.
Set you up with a drink.
Oye! Mira!
Hit us up with a couple
of cervezas.
What's up with you
and the manners?
I know you didn't just whistle
for me like some dog.
- Oh, baby...
- Don't you "baby" me, baby.
You're the worst
tipper in here.
What, that ring on your finger,
that don't count?
Finally pulled
the trigger, Freddy?
- All right.
- You know it, baby.
Hey, she's got some
good-looking sisters.
Unless you're still all hung up
on that farm girl back in Iowa.
- Kansas.
- Same thing.
No, not the same thing.
Yeah. Hold on a second.
Don't go anywhere,
all right?
Where am I gonna go?
<i>Sarah, the schedule's changed.</i>
It's happening tomorrow
during the President's address.
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can,</i>
but there's something
I need to take care of.
You get everything together
and I'll meet you back as soon as I can.
Where are you going?
<i>To get my kids.</i>
<i>Robert, there isn't enough time.</i>
Robert!
Anna.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
He's a good man.
I don't know
how good he his, but...
he promised to take care of me.
- Call me crazy, I believe him.
- What's this?
My best man hitting
on my fiance?
Best man?
You gonna make me ask?
You're more a brother to me
than the one I grew up with.
Back at ya.
I'm happy to do it.
Got some more good news, too.
Uh, sweetie, will you...
will you give us
a moment to talk?
What if I told you
I got a gig lined up?
Eight weeks,
a hundred G's, all cash.
What kind of gig?
The kind we're good at.
Cargo run.
Quick in, quick out.
$30,000 up front,
$70,000 when it's done.
Where?
Afghanistan.
- No.
- Come on.
You've been looking
for work for what, six months?
We do this one gig
and we are set.
You could open that flight school.
Maybe go home, snag back that girl.
Why are you doing this to me?
I can't believe you'd even ask
after what we saw over there,
what we did.
All we did was
not get killed, J.
Innocent people died, Freddy.
Innocent people.
I see it every time
I close my eyes.
Which isn't too damn often
these days.
Well, we'll be smarter
this time, man.
You know that I got
your back, man.
I'm sorry.
You're on your own this time.
I can't go back there.
I'll tell you what, Jerry,
you agree
to sit down face to face,
I'll flip you a pair of
open day boxes at Wrigley.
No strings.
I swear on a stack
of cheddar dogs.
Great.
6:00 at The Pump Room.
See you there.
Chicago again?
Hey, teach, half day?
Feel like helping me
prepare a syllabus or...
grading 30 essays on
Orwell's Animal Farm?
No, I have a better idea.
Have a sub do that and come
to Chicago with me tonight.
That would send
a great message to my students.
I'll write a letter for you.
"Dear kids, sorry I can't teach
you ungrateful brats today.
"I'm with my fiance getting drunk
on draft beer and having
tons of Chicago-style sex."
I think it's Chicago-style pizza.
That, too.
One night.
Your students will catch up.
Book it.
Seriously?
You're not going to try
to talk me out of it now, are you?
No. I'm done talking.
<i>46 tackles, three sacks</i>
<i>and a couple of interceptions...</i>
You all right?
I'm worried
about Freddy.
You want a beer?
No.
I think he's in over
his head with something.
What are you talking about?
These guys started
coming around.
Like...
soldiers but not.
They, they came by
again after you left.
Well, he's a big boy.
He can hang out
with whoever he chooses.
It's not like that.
When he came back,
Freddy had a black eye, saying
he's going away for two months
and not to try to find him.
Tell him you don't want him to go.
You don't think I did that?
He says he doesn't
have a choice,
that he's doing it for me.
What do you want me to do?
Help him.
Go with him if you have to.
I know what he did for you
in Iraq.
I know you owe him your life.
Yeah.
That doesn't appear to be
worth very much, right now.
I'm pregnant, Jake.
I just...
I have a bad feeling
about all this.
- Robert, what...
- Don't make a scene.
What are you doing here?
You need to come with me.
Look, don't tell me
what to do.
You are not allowed
within 500 feet of this family.
Circumstances have changed, Darcy.
Mom!
Mom.
Oh, my God. The kids.
Unlock the door from the inside.
Alison, it's, it's okay.
It's okay.
You let them out of there right now,
or so help me,
I'll start screaming.
No, you listen to me
very carefully.
In five seconds,
I'm getting on this truck
and I am leaving
Washington for good.
And I did not come here
to discuss this with you.
Now you can
either trust me,
and come with us
or you can stay here.
But you will never ever
see your children again.
Hey, buddy, you in?
I'm in.
Glad you changed your mind.
I'm telling you,
this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Then how come this isn't the first time
I've heard you say that?
Do me a favor.
Skip ahead in your mind
a couple of months.
Visualize yourself on a...
Mexican beach,
knee deep in bikinis
and Benjamins.
I try not to think
that far ahead.
Keeps me from being disappointed
when things go to hell.
My pop once told me
if you don't keep an eye
towards where you're going,
you'll never get there.
Speaking of eyes...
You should see the other guy.
Fine, introduce us.
Who's the job for, Freddy?
Don't matter who.
They know you, and
your reputation.
I'm not going anywhere
until I know.
It's an offshoot of Ravenwood.
You'll meet 'em, tomorrow
right before we get on a plane.
In the meantime,
all you gotta worry about...
is this.
There's three times that
waiting for you
when this is over.
All we gotta do is
run a convoy through enemy territory
without getting killed.
How many times I gotta get your back
before you start believing it, huh?
Seat's all yours.
Thank you.
Yeah, I hate, I hate sitting when
I got money on a game.
<i>Swung on, it's a high
blast out toward left field.</i>
<i>It's way back, and it is gone!</i>
Mary Bailey, you owe me five bucks.
Pay up!
Better yet, better yet.
Buy my, uh,
good luck charm here,
a drink on me.
Don't waste your money,
I have an expense account.
What is your best wine?
Beer.
Vodka, rocks.
Did you know that it
is a three-hour cab ride
from the airport to
this godforsaken town?
Scenic, though, ain't it?
If you like corn.
Well, now,
who doesn't like corn?
I mean, you got
corn on the cob,
cornflakes, corn nuts,
corn dogs, cornsicles.
Cornsicles?
It's a joke, lady.
Can you not talk
to me, please?
Thank you.
- Corn, corn chips?
- Seriously.
Don't talk to me.
Bailey's.
<i>Hey, there.</i>
Hi.
Am I going to see you this week?
<i>Well, you can see me right now.</i>
<i>Just turn around.</i>
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
You have no idea
<i>how badly I want
to kiss you right now.</i>
Well.
<i>Why don't you step
into my office?</i>
What in the...
heck do we have here?
It's time for some changes, Johnston.
Starting with your diet.
A man can't live on that.
Can if he wants to
stay married to me.
Your blood pressure was ten
points over your last checkup.
Well, that's just the stress.
It's always up at election time.
Then drop out of the race.
What has gotten into you?
Something happened watching April
listen to your heartbeat.
I began to wonder.
How many good years do
we have left together?
Did you hear something I didn't?
'Cause all she told me was
I might be getting a cold.
This isn't,
this isn't just about health,
yours or mine.
When you first took office
you made two oaths.
One to the people
of this town,
and the other one to me.
Do you rember
what you said?
Yeah.
That I would never let the job
come before you and the kids.
I'm just asking
for equal time.
I hear you, honey.
You all stay put.
Mom, do something.
Robert, let us go.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'll be back
in five minutes.
- And then what?
- And then...
we leave town.
Oh, you're crazy,
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Dad, stop. Dad!
Let go of her,
Robert!
Listen to me, okay.
I would never do
anything to hurt you,
your mother, or your brother.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
I barely know you.
Listen, Robert,
you are scaring Samuel.
Unscare him, Darcy.
Do you have your cell phone?
No, he took it when
he picked me up.
Not mine.
Really?
Where is it, honey?
In my backpack.
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>
The door was unlocked.
I love what you've done
with the place.
What do you want, Agent Hicks?
Guess whose name
just popped up
on an international
passenger manifest?
You got me on
a no-fly list now?
No, not yet, but...
I thought maybe...
we could work out a deal.
You're about to get into bed
with some very bad people, Jake.
Lucky for you,
your timing is perfect.
We're looking to nail Ravenwood.
They did that?
They've been running weapons
since the start of the war.
They'll sell arms to anybody,
even our enemies.
We need someone working for us
that they'll
consider credible.
And why would I
say yes to you?
Because...
...you know firsthand
what they're capable of.
Sarah, come on, we don't have...
Sarah?
Hold it right there.
Drop the case.
Walk towards me slowly.
Put your hands in the air... now!
This your truck?
It's a rental.
Moving day, you know?
What seems to
be the problem?
Open the back.
Okay.
What the hell?
Cuff him.
Hands behind your back.
Help! Help!
Unlock the door.
- Please.
- It's okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.
- Can you open this door?
- We can't.
Can you unlock the door.
Watch out!
- Here, Mayor Green.
- Thank you, Mary.
Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Eric.
- Mary.
Oh, darlin', would you get him
a beer, too?
Sure thing.
Thanks.
So, um...
Why did I ask you here?
Yeah. Is everything okay?
Uh, your mother and I have been...
talking about the next
chapter in our lives.
Be more accurate, she's...
pointing out how I seem to be
unwilling to turn the page.
Sounds like Mom.
When I first took office,
you were in... what? Third grade?
Second.
My team won the pee-wee
football trophy that year.
I scored two touchdowns
in the championship game.
Hard to remember
back that far.
Maybe because
you didn't make the game, Dad.
Right.
Well,
your mother is afraid that if I keep
going the way I'm going,
we're gonna wind up
missing more than
pee-wee football.
And I've been
thinking about it,
and I want to ask
you a question.
If I decided to drop
out of the race,
would you consider
running in my place?
What?
You'd make a good candidate, son.
You've been here
your whole life, you live clean,
unlike your brother Jake.
Plus, selfishly, I'd get to...
step down and still have some influence
over how things were run.
Oh, y-you're serious?
Well, you...
You're smart, you're decisive.
Even got yourself a law degree.
Which I plan on using some day.
Plan on doing a lot
of things some day.
Nothing you've
been sharing with me.
Let me know if you
need anything else.
So, you take the night
and think about it.
Talk to April about it.
It's gonna effect her, too.
Yeah.
Hey.
- What's up?
- We need to talk.
What's up?
Cargo, we're transporting
for Ravenwood,
you have any idea what it is?
I don't ask those kind
of questions, man.
Stinger Missiles. RPGs.
It's not like this was ever some
kind of humanitarian mission.
They've been selling them
to the insurgents, Freddie
They'll be used to kill our own guys!
The Feds are on
to the whole thing.
They want us to help
take down Ravenwood.
Whoa. Are you crazy?
We don't have a choice.
They're watching us.
So is Ravenwood, man.
I'm more worried about them
than the government.
If we don't work with the Feds,
they'll make sure
Ravenwood believes you are.
- You got your money with you?
- What?
- Your money.
- Yeah, I can get it.
Get Anna, grab whatever you can,
we'll meet in an hour.
- Then what?
- We'll take off tonight.
If they come after us, at least
we'll have a head start.
All right?
Nobody from school
better see us.
Gonna make it pretty hard for me
to get on that plane tonight
and call in sick tomorrow.
You know, if this was Chicago,
you could walk for miles
without ever running
into anyone you know.
Really? Chicago again?
Plus, there's the pizza,
the Cubs, the culture...
What are you getting at, huh?
Okay, I have a confession.
The meeting tomorrow
isn't just a meeting.
It's an interview for a startup
venture capital firm.
Final interview,
actually.
Are you serious?
Well, I thought maybe you could
get to know the city a little.
You might fall in love with it.
You're a jerk.
Emily, we have to at
least talk about it.
We have talked about this.
This is not the kind of opportunity
you can just say no to.
Really?
No.
There. How hard is that?
I cannot believe you.
We're supposed to be married
in a few months.
Why do you think I'm doing this?
Because you're selfish,
and you don't listen.
I told you when you proposed to me
I didn't want to move.
Now you go behind my back like this?
Yeah, well, screw me for thinking
you might be open
to changing your mind.
I mean, what is it about
this town that's got you so...
addicted to it?
This town is my history.
It is everything
that I know and love.
It's where I want
my kids to grow up.
If you don't understand that,
then maybe...
Maybe what?
I'm not getting on that plane
with you tonight.
If you decide to take that job tomorrow,
then don't bother coming back.
I'm tired.
Allison,
there are two bedrooms
upstairs.
Take your brother up to the one
on the right. That's where you'll sleep.
Who's stuff is all this?
Who lives here?
We do.
Go on upstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.
Come on, Sammy.
I'll read to you.
I don't know what's going on, Robert,
and right now, I'm...
I'm too exhausted to fight,
but I promise you one thing.
Come tomorrow,
one way or another,
I will have you arrested.
But you know, come tomorrow,
a whole lot of things
will be different.
Freddie, come here.
- All right. What happened?!
- Ravenwood.
Those sons a bitches shot me!
Oh, God!
Take it easy,
take it easy.
Find Anna.
Make sure she's all right.
First, we got to get
you to the hospital.
All I care about
is Anna and my kid.
Get them on that bus.
Then you get the hell
out of here, too!
They're gonna come after you.
Oh, they're coming after you.
Try to stay with me.
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>
I need an ambulance right away.
My friend's been shot,
he's lost a lot of blood.
<i>Is he breathing?</i>
Stay with me, Freddie!
<i>Sir, is he breathing?</i>
Stay with me, man.
Come on, man, stay with me.
You're all right.
You're all right.
Stay with me.
I can't believe he's gone.
I'm really sorry.
It's not your fault. You did...
You did everything that you could.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
It belonged to Freddie.
Use it for the baby.
My family will help me.
You keep it.
No.
I promised him.
Just put it away.
<i>Platform for Houston.
Platform six.</i>
You better go.
Come with me.
Come on,
you can start over, too.
No, I can't. Not yet.
Then where will you go?
You were up early.
Oh, I've been coughing all night.
I didn't want to wake you.
Paris.
I hate France.
I'm sure they'd be
devastated to hear it.
Studied French and Italian
for four years.
After all those years,
all I can remember is my name,
how to count to ten and,
"Would you please pass
that packet of sugar?"
Book the trip.
I don't think they take reservations
six years in advance.
I was thinking
more like Christmas.
What the hell.
Book one for Italy, too.
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Is anybody there?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
Jake.
<i>One new message.</i>
Hey, Emily, it's Roger.
Just tried your cell,
but I couldn't reach you.
Hopefully, you haven't run off
with the milkman yet.
Last night was terrible.
I kept wanting to...
get up and tell the captain
I'd made a horrible mistake,
and to turn the plane around.
My home is where you are, babe.
And if that means Jericho, Kansas
for the rest of my life,
it'll be a happy one.
I'm flying back tonight.
I get into Wichita at 10:30.
I can't think of anything
I'd rather see
than your beautiful face
when I get home.
And in case you're wondering, I...
I didn't go on that interview.
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, it's you.
Yeah, sorry, not ringing a bell.
Look, I have been standing out
here forever waiting for a cab.
Yeah, I suggest you nicely
ask someone for a ride.
Do you know where
the Richmond Farm is?
Well, yeah, I ought to.
I'm Stanley Richmond.
- You got to be kidding.
- No.
You see, now is the part
where you tell me your name.
Mimi Clark.
Really? Well, it's...
nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.
Do you not read your mail?
Nope. Nothing but bills
and bad news. Why?
Well, this would be a little of both.
I work for the IRS.
And according to our records,
you owe more than $180,000
in back taxes.
It's nice to meet you.
<i>Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.</i>
<i>We all know that
these divisions pale in comparison</i>
<i>to the fundamental dangers posed
by the thrt of terrorism.</i>
<i>We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world</i>
<i>a better place for our children
and grandchildren.</i>
<i>This has always been our promise.</i>
Not another step.
Where are my kids?
Give me the keys.
Darcy, put that gun down,
'cause you don't even
know how to use it.
I don't want to shoot you, Robert,
but so help me, I'm prepared to!
Now, give me the keys!
<i>Mom! Mom, come quick!</i>
Baby, stay outside!
<i>Mom! Mom!
Something's happening!</i>
<i>Woody, what are you looking at?</i>
Jake!
Jake, we got
to go outside!
Now!
<i>Help them.
Help them.</i>
Bring them inside.
Some of them were on planes.
Landed in the middle of nowhere.
Been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
<i>Can you give me
a hand with this?</i>
Oh, my God.
Roger.
Is it really you?
I thought you were dead.
Come on. Come with me.
We only have another half hour
before the generators shut down.
Well, I'm sure they'll
make an exception.
Do we have any extra blankets?
I already brought everything
down I could find. Listen, Eric,
these people need medical attention.
You have to find a doctor.
I'm okay.
Are there any more people out there?
We could send a search party.
21 men
and 32 women.
I'll do a head count.
What happened to you out there?
We waited in that field
for two days
after our plane went down.
No one came.
Eventually, I...
went for help.
I walked for...
I don't how long.
Wound up in this...
refugee camp.
Nebraska.
Most of us are from there.
I can't imagine
what you've seen out there.
Roger?
I said, I can't imagine
what you've seen.
Couldn't have
imagined it either.
Hey, wash up.
Dinner's almost ready.
Robert?
Darcy,
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while
until I can sort something out.
What does that mean?
It means you stay inside,
and you don't answer the door.
Here.
We're playing football.
Man, Sam,
that is really cool.
Daddy's gonna put that
on the fridge.
Sam, I want you to go upstairs,
tell your sister dinner's ready.
Okay? Right now.
<i>Allison!</i>
Are we in danger, Robert?
I've asked you that question
a thousand times,
you've always said no.
I don't...
mean to scare you, D.
All right, we'll do
whatever you say.
I trust you.
My God. Where did
they all come from?
I'm gonna need warm water,
as much as you can make.
I've made a list of the injured.
How's he doing?
I think he might be in shock.
He doesn't want to be treated
until everybody else
has been seen.
- Jake, I, um...
- Go.
He's gonna need you.
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>
<i>You need to keep them
clean and warm.</i>
Do you have a place to stay?
Do you know anyone
in Jericho?
Actually...
I do.
Nice planes.
Yeah, every aircraft
we operate is augmented
with custom security
and design features
you won't find
in any other fleet.
I see that you're
an Embry-Riddle grad.
ATP-certified,
1,600 verified FAA hours.
Clearly well qualified,
Mr. Green.
Flying's in my blood.
I started working on my Grandpa's
crop duster when I was 10.
Now you understand
that we charter
exclusively
to top executives
and celebrity clients,
so absolute discretion
is a must for our flight crew.
Hey, anything past
getting the plane
safely from "A to "B"
is none of my business.
Good, of course, finding
out everything we can
about the people who are piloting
our planes is our business.
And according
to your visa records,
you spent a little time in the
Middle East over the last few years.
14 months in Afghanistan, 6 in Iraq.
But you were never military?
I worked for an
independent contractor.
Left that off the resum.
I didn't think
it was relevant.
State Department has you
flagged as a person of interest.
I'm an interesting guy.
There was an incident.
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
Which contractor
were you working with
when this
incident occurred?
One of the big ones.
- Halliburton, Blackwater?
- You said discretion was a must.
Look, I'm going to be straight with you.
I think there's room in our operation
for someone like you,
but there is no way
that I can hire you if you
are unable to clear this up.
Do you understand that?
Thank you for your time.
<i>The president is scheduled
to address the nation tomorrow</i>
<i>amid growing disapproval.</i>
<i>Recent polls show his rating
plunging double digits</i>
<i>into the 20s,
even amongst partisan voters.</i>
<i>With midterm elections
on the horizon,</i>
<i>this is not a good sign
for the administration.</i>
I've already been
summoned, Sarah.
They want me in position.
This is good news.
We talking locally
or back to the farmland?
I'm waiting to hear.
Congratulations.
It was your idea.
I have to say that...
when they recruited me,
I thought I was prepared
for just about anything.
But nothing like this.
Well, that's because
nothing like this...
has ever happened before.
This is it.
Yes.
This is the moment
we've prepared for.
All the devices
have been secured.
The other cells are receiving
their instructions as we speak.
The target cities
have been confirmed.
Your routes have been scouted
and cleared.
We're ready.
The strike will go off tomorrow
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.
Take a look around you,
gentlemen.
These are the faces of the men
who will change the world.
Season 1 Episode 12
"The Day Before"
Transcript: swsub.com
Synchro: Loky
[ www.seriessub.com ]
- Hey, Dad, you got a second?
- Nope.
USA Today's having a contest
to find the top five
towns under 5,000.
I was thinking we
should submit Jericho.
Why, so some big
developer can come in
and start buying
the town up,
maybe turn Main Street
into a strip mall
with a half a dozen
coffee shops or so?
Dad, there are worse things in the world
- than vente frappuccinos.
- Speak English.
This could be a good thing.
The kind of headlines
that will bring out voters next month.
Son, I am not worried
about beating Gray Anderson.
The people of this town
have kept me in office
for over 20 years.
I will earn their votes
by doing the job
they hired me to do.
What are you guys doing here?
Your father missed
his checkup this morning
and April was nice enough
to take off
her lunch hour
to make a house call.
Well, sorry, Doc, but we're
gonna have to reschedule
- for sometime after the election.
- Johnston.
You're gonna do this
whether you like it or not.
I've had this terrible cold
and you've not been feeling
well for almost a week.
It's a bad one.
Half my staff
has come down with it.
Do you want to strip here
or would you like to go
somewhere a little less public?
My office.
That's my guy.
Yo, yo, how'd it go?
Well, Freddy...
so much for your lucky tie.
"Driver wanted.
Military experience.
Plus, travel opportunities."
Something tells me they're not
talking about the Bahamas.
I need a job.
You're no driver, man.
You're a pilot,
a freakin' good one.
Right now, all I am is broke.
Unless you want
to pay my rent for me.
Sorry?!
Tell you what I can do, though.
Set you up with a drink.
Oye! Mira!
Hit us up with a couple
of cervezas.
What's up with you
and the manners?
I know you didn't just whistle
for me like some dog.
- Oh, baby...
- Don't you "baby" me, baby.
You're the worst
tipper in here.
What, that ring on your finger,
that don't count?
Finally pulled
the trigger, Freddy?
- All right.
- You know it, baby.
Hey, she's got some
good-looking sisters.
Unless you're still all hung up
on that farm girl back in Iowa.
- Kansas.
- Same thing.
No, not the same thing.
Yeah. Hold on a second.
Don't go anywhere,
all right?
Where am I gonna go?
<i>Sarah, the schedule's changed.</i>
It's happening tomorrow
during the President's address.
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can,</i>
but there's something
I need to take care of.
You get everything together
and I'll meet you back as soon as I can.
Where are you going?
<i>To get my kids.</i>
<i>Robert, there isn't enough time.</i>
Robert!
Anna.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
He's a good man.
I don't know
how good he his, but...
he promised to take care of me.
- Call me crazy, I believe him.
- What's this?
My best man hitting
on my fiance?
Best man?
You gonna make me ask?
You're more a brother to me
than the one I grew up with.
Back at ya.
I'm happy to do it.
Got some more good news, too.
Uh, sweetie, will you...
will you give us
a moment to talk?
What if I told you
I got a gig lined up?
Eight weeks,
a hundred G's, all cash.
What kind of gig?
The kind we're good at.
Cargo run.
Quick in, quick out.
$30,000 up front,
$70,000 when it's done.
Where?
Afghanistan.
- No.
- Come on.
You've been looking
for work for what, six months?
We do this one gig
and we are set.
You could open that flight school.
Maybe go home, snag back that girl.
Why are you doing this to me?
I can't believe you'd even ask
after what we saw over there,
what we did.
All we did was
not get killed, J.
Innocent people died, Freddy.
Innocent people.
I see it every time
I close my eyes.
Which isn't too damn often
these days.
Well, we'll be smarter
this time, man.
You know that I got
your back, man.
I'm sorry.
You're on your own this time.
I can't go back there.
I'll tell you what, Jerry,
you agree
to sit down face to face,
I'll flip you a pair of
open day boxes at Wrigley.
No strings.
I swear on a stack
of cheddar dogs.
Great.
6:00 at The Pump Room.
See you there.
Chicago again?
Hey, teach, half day?
Feel like helping me
prepare a syllabus or...
grading 30 essays on
Orwell's Animal Farm?
No, I have a better idea.
Have a sub do that and come
to Chicago with me tonight.
That would send
a great message to my students.
I'll write a letter for you.
"Dear kids, sorry I can't teach
you ungrateful brats today.
"I'm with my fiance getting drunk
on draft beer and having
tons of Chicago-style sex."
I think it's Chicago-style pizza.
That, too.
One night.
Your students will catch up.
Book it.
Seriously?
You're not going to try
to talk me out of it now, are you?
No. I'm done talking.
<i>46 tackles, three sacks</i>
<i>and a couple of interceptions...</i>
You all right?
I'm worried
about Freddy.
You want a beer?
No.
I think he's in over
his head with something.
What are you talking about?
These guys started
coming around.
Like...
soldiers but not.
They, they came by
again after you left.
Well, he's a big boy.
He can hang out
with whoever he chooses.
It's not like that.
When he came back,
Freddy had a black eye, saying
he's going away for two months
and not to try to find him.
Tell him you don't want him to go.
You don't think I did that?
He says he doesn't
have a choice,
that he's doing it for me.
What do you want me to do?
Help him.
Go with him if you have to.
I know what he did for you
in Iraq.
I know you owe him your life.
Yeah.
That doesn't appear to be
worth very much, right now.
I'm pregnant, Jake.
I just...
I have a bad feeling
about all this.
- Robert, what...
- Don't make a scene.
What are you doing here?
You need to come with me.
Look, don't tell me
what to do.
You are not allowed
within 500 feet of this family.
Circumstances have changed, Darcy.
Mom!
Mom.
Oh, my God. The kids.
Unlock the door from the inside.
Alison, it's, it's okay.
It's okay.
You let them out of there right now,
or so help me,
I'll start screaming.
No, you listen to me
very carefully.
In five seconds,
I'm getting on this truck
and I am leaving
Washington for good.
And I did not come here
to discuss this with you.
Now you can
either trust me,
and come with us
or you can stay here.
But you will never ever
see your children again.
Hey, buddy, you in?
I'm in.
Glad you changed your mind.
I'm telling you,
this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Then how come this isn't the first time
I've heard you say that?
Do me a favor.
Skip ahead in your mind
a couple of months.
Visualize yourself on a...
Mexican beach,
knee deep in bikinis
and Benjamins.
I try not to think
that far ahead.
Keeps me from being disappointed
when things go to hell.
My pop once told me
if you don't keep an eye
towards where you're going,
you'll never get there.
Speaking of eyes...
You should see the other guy.
Fine, introduce us.
Who's the job for, Freddy?
Don't matter who.
They know you, and
your reputation.
I'm not going anywhere
until I know.
It's an offshoot of Ravenwood.
You'll meet 'em, tomorrow
right before we get on a plane.
In the meantime,
all you gotta worry about...
is this.
There's three times that
waiting for you
when this is over.
All we gotta do is
run a convoy through enemy territory
without getting killed.
How many times I gotta get your back
before you start believing it, huh?
Seat's all yours.
Thank you.
Yeah, I hate, I hate sitting when
I got money on a game.
<i>Swung on, it's a high
blast out toward left field.</i>
<i>It's way back, and it is gone!</i>
Mary Bailey, you owe me five bucks.
Pay up!
Better yet, better yet.
Buy my, uh,
good luck charm here,
a drink on me.
Don't waste your money,
I have an expense account.
What is your best wine?
Beer.
Vodka, rocks.
Did you know that it
is a three-hour cab ride
from the airport to
this godforsaken town?
Scenic, though, ain't it?
If you like corn.
Well, now,
who doesn't like corn?
I mean, you got
corn on the cob,
cornflakes, corn nuts,
corn dogs, cornsicles.
Cornsicles?
It's a joke, lady.
Can you not talk
to me, please?
Thank you.
- Corn, corn chips?
- Seriously.
Don't talk to me.
Bailey's.
<i>Hey, there.</i>
Hi.
Am I going to see you this week?
<i>Well, you can see me right now.</i>
<i>Just turn around.</i>
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
You have no idea
<i>how badly I want
to kiss you right now.</i>
Well.
<i>Why don't you step
into my office?</i>
What in the...
heck do we have here?
It's time for some changes, Johnston.
Starting with your diet.
A man can't live on that.
Can if he wants to
stay married to me.
Your blood pressure was ten
points over your last checkup.
Well, that's just the stress.
It's always up at election time.
Then drop out of the race.
What has gotten into you?
Something happened watching April
listen to your heartbeat.
I began to wonder.
How many good years do
we have left together?
Did you hear something I didn't?
'Cause all she told me was
I might be getting a cold.
This isn't,
this isn't just about health,
yours or mine.
When you first took office
you made two oaths.
One to the people
of this town,
and the other one to me.
Do you rember
what you said?
Yeah.
That I would never let the job
come before you and the kids.
I'm just asking
for equal time.
I hear you, honey.
You all stay put.
Mom, do something.
Robert, let us go.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'll be back
in five minutes.
- And then what?
- And then...
we leave town.
Oh, you're crazy,
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Dad, stop. Dad!
Let go of her,
Robert!
Listen to me, okay.
I would never do
anything to hurt you,
your mother, or your brother.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
I barely know you.
Listen, Robert,
you are scaring Samuel.
Unscare him, Darcy.
Do you have your cell phone?
No, he took it when
he picked me up.
Not mine.
Really?
Where is it, honey?
In my backpack.
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>
The door was unlocked.
I love what you've done
with the place.
What do you want, Agent Hicks?
Guess whose name
just popped up
on an international
passenger manifest?
You got me on
a no-fly list now?
No, not yet, but...
I thought maybe...
we could work out a deal.
You're about to get into bed
with some very bad people, Jake.
Lucky for you,
your timing is perfect.
We're looking to nail Ravenwood.
They did that?
They've been running weapons
since the start of the war.
They'll sell arms to anybody,
even our enemies.
We need someone working for us
that they'll
consider credible.
And why would I
say yes to you?
Because...
...you know firsthand
what they're capable of.
Sarah, come on, we don't have...
Sarah?
Hold it right there.
Drop the case.
Walk towards me slowly.
Put your hands in the air... now!
This your truck?
It's a rental.
Moving day, you know?
What seems to
be the problem?
Open the back.
Okay.
What the hell?
Cuff him.
Hands behind your back.
Help! Help!
Unlock the door.
- Please.
- It's okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.
- Can you open this door?
- We can't.
Can you unlock the door.
Watch out!
Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Eric.
- Mary.
Oh, darlin', would you get him
a beer, too?
Sure thing.
Thanks.
So, um...
Why did I ask you here?
Yeah. Is everything okay?
Uh, your mother and I have been...
talking about the next
chapter in our lives.
Be more accurate, she's...
pointing out how I seem to be
unwilling to turn the page.
Sounds like Mom.
When I first took office,
you were in... what? Third grade?
Second.
My team won the pee-wee
football trophy that year.
I scored two touchdowns
in the championship game.
Hard to remember
back that far.
Maybe because
you didn't make the game, Dad.
Right.
Well,
your mother is afraid that if I keep
going the way I'm going,
we're gonna wind up
missing more than
pee-wee football.
And I've been
thinking about it,
and I want to ask
you a question.
If I decided to drop
out of the race,
would you consider
running in my place?
What?
You'd make a good candidate, son.
You've been here
your whole life, you live clean,
unlike your brother Jake.
Plus, selfishly, I'd get to...
step down and still have some influence
over how things were run.
Oh, y-you're serious?
Well, you...
You're smart, you're decisive.
Even got yourself a law degree.
Which I plan on using some day.
Plan on doing a lot
of things some day.
Nothing you've
been sharing with me.
Let me know if you
need anything else.
So, you take the night
and think about it.
Talk to April about it.
It's gonna effect her, too.
Yeah.
Hey.
- What's up?
- We need to talk.
What's up?
Cargo, we're transporting
for Ravenwood,
you have any idea what it is?
I don't ask those kind
of questions, man.
Stinger Missiles. RPGs.
It's not like this was ever some
kind of humanitarian mission.
They've been selling them
to the insurgents, Freddie
They'll be used to kill our own guys!
The Feds are on
to the whole thing.
They want us to help
take down Ravenwood.
Whoa. Are you crazy?
We don't have a choice.
They're watching us.
So is Ravenwood, man.
I'm more worried about them
than the government.
If we don't work with the Feds,
they'll make sure
Ravenwood believes you are.
- You got your money with you?
- What?
- Your money.
- Yeah, I can get it.
Get Anna, grab whatever you can,
we'll meet in an hour.
- Then what?
- We'll take off tonight.
If they come after us, at least
we'll have a head start.
All right?
Nobody from school
better see us.
Gonna make it pretty hard for me
to get on that plane tonight
and call in sick tomorrow.
You know, if this was Chicago,
you could walk for miles
without ever running
into anyone you know.
Really? Chicago again?
Plus, there's the pizza,
the Cubs, the culture...
What are you getting at, huh?
Okay, I have a confession.
The meeting tomorrow
isn't just a meeting.
It's an interview for a startup
venture capital firm.
Final interview,
actually.
Are you serious?
Well, I thought maybe you could
get to know the city a little.
You might fall in love with it.
You're a jerk.
Emily, we have to at
least talk about it.
We have talked about this.
This is not the kind of opportunity
you can just say no to.
Really?
No.
There. How hard is that?
I cannot believe you.
We're supposed to be married
in a few months.
Why do you think I'm doing this?
Because you're selfish,
and you don't listen.
I told you when you proposed to me
I didn't want to move.
Now you go behind my back like this?
Yeah, well, screw me for thinking
you might be open
to changing your mind.
I mean, what is it about
this town that's got you so...
addicted to it?
This town is my history.
It is everything
that I know and love.
It's where I want
my kids to grow up.
If you don't understand that,
then maybe...
Maybe what?
I'm not getting on that plane
with you tonight.
If you decide to take that job tomorrow,
then don't bother coming back.
I'm tired.
Allison,
there are two bedrooms
upstairs.
Take your brother up to the one
on the right. That's where you'll sleep.
Who's stuff is all this?
Who lives here?
We do.
Go on upstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.
Come on, Sammy.
I'll read to you.
I don't know what's going on, Robert,
and right now, I'm...
I'm too exhausted to fight,
but I promise you one thing.
Come tomorrow,
one way or another,
I will have you arrested.
But you know, come tomorrow,
a whole lot of things
will be different.
Freddie, come here.
- All right. What happened?!
- Ravenwood.
Those sons a bitches shot me!
Oh, God!
Take it easy,
take it easy.
Find Anna.
Make sure she's all right.
First, we got to get
you to the hospital.
All I care about
is Anna and my kid.
Get them on that bus.
Then you get the hell
out of here, too!
They're gonna come after you.
Oh, they're coming after you.
Try to stay with me.
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>
I need an ambulance right away.
My friend's been shot,
he's lost a lot of blood.
<i>Is he breathing?</i>
Stay with me, Freddie!
<i>Sir, is he breathing?</i>
Stay with me, man.
Come on, man, stay with me.
You're all right.
You're all right.
Stay with me.
I can't believe he's gone.
I'm really sorry.
It's not your fault. You did...
You did everything that you could.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
It belonged to Freddie.
Use it for the baby.
My family will help me.
You keep it.
No.
I promised him.
Just put it away.
<i>Platform for Houston.
Platform six.</i>
You better go.
Come with me.
Come on,
you can start over, too.
No, I can't. Not yet.
Then where will you go?
You were up early.
Oh, I've been coughing all night.
I didn't want to wake you.
Paris.
I hate France.
I'm sure they'd be
devastated to hear it.
Studied French and Italian
for four years.
After all those years,
all I can remember is my name,
how to count to ten and,
"Would you please pass
that packet of sugar?"
Book the trip.
I don't think they take reservations
six years in advance.
I was thinking
more like Christmas.
What the hell.
Book one for Italy, too.
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Is anybody there?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
Jake.
<i>One new message.</i>
Hey, Emily, it's Roger.
Just tried your cell,
but I couldn't reach you.
Hopefully, you haven't run off
with the milkman yet.
Last night was terrible.
I kept wanting to...
get up and tell the captain
I'd made a horrible mistake,
and to turn the plane around.
My home is where you are, babe.
And if that means Jericho, Kansas
for the rest of my life,
it'll be a happy one.
I'm flying back tonight.
I get into Wichita at 10:30.
I can't think of anything
I'd rather see
than your beautiful face
when I get home.
And in case you're wondering, I...
I didn't go on that interview.
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, it's you.
Yeah, sorry, not ringing a bell.
Look, I have been standing out
here forever waiting for a cab.
Yeah, I suggest you nicely
ask someone for a ride.
Do you know where
the Richmond Farm is?
Well, yeah, I ought to.
I'm Stanley Richmond.
- You got to be kidding.
- No.
You see, now is the part
where you tell me your name.
Mimi Clark.
Really? Well, it's...
nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.
Do you not read your mail?
Nope. Nothing but bills
and bad news. Why?
Well, this would be a little of both.
I work for the IRS.
And according to our records,
you owe more than $180,000
in back taxes.
It's nice to meet you.
<i>Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.</i>
<i>We all know that
these divisions pale in comparison</i>
<i>to the fundamental dangers posed
by the thrt of terrorism.</i>
<i>We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world</i>
<i>a better place for our children
and grandchildren.</i>
<i>This has always been our promise.</i>
Not another step.
Where are my kids?
Give me the keys.
Darcy, put that gun down,
'cause you don't even
know how to use it.
I don't want to shoot you, Robert,
but so help me, I'm prepared to!
Now, give me the keys!
<i>Mom! Mom, come quick!</i>
Baby, stay outside!
<i>Mom! Mom!
Something's happening!</i>
<i>Woody, what are you looking at?</i>
Jake!
Jake, we got
to go outside!
Now!
<i>Help them.
Help them.</i>
Bring them inside.
Some of them were on planes.
Landed in the middle of nowhere.
Been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
<i>Can you give me
a hand with this?</i>
Oh, my God.
Roger.
Is it really you?
I thought you were dead.
Come on. Come with me.
We only have another half hour
before the generators shut down.
Well, I'm sure they'll
make an exception.
Do we have any extra blankets?
I already brought everything
down I could find. Listen, Eric,
these people need medical attention.
You have to find a doctor.
I'm okay.
Are there any more people out there?
We could send a search party.
21 men
and 32 women.
I'll do a head count.
What happened to you out there?
We waited in that field
for two days
after our plane went down.
No one came.
Eventually, I...
went for help.
I walked for...
I don't how long.
Wound up in this...
refugee camp.
Nebraska.
Most of us are from there.
I can't imagine
what you've seen out there.
Roger?
I said, I can't imagine
what you've seen.
Couldn't have
imagined it either.
Hey, wash up.
Dinner's almost ready.
Robert?
Darcy,
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while
until I can sort something out.
What does that mean?
It means you stay inside,
and you don't answer the door.
Here.
We're playing football.
Man, Sam,
that is really cool.
Daddy's gonna put that
on the fridge.
Sam, I want you to go upstairs,
tell your sister dinner's ready.
Okay? Right now.
<i>Allison!</i>
Are we in danger, Robert?
I've asked you that question
a thousand times,
you've always said no.
I don't...
mean to scare you, D.
All right, we'll do
whatever you say.
I trust you.
My God. Where did
they all come from?
I'm gonna need warm water,
as much as you can make.
I've made a list of the injured.
How's he doing?
I think he might be in shock.
He doesn't want to be treated
until everybody else
has been seen.
- Jake, I, um...
- Go.
He's gonna need you.
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>
<i>You need to keep them
clean and warm.</i>
Do you have a place to stay?
Do you know anyone
in Jericho?
Actually...
I do.
Nice planes.
Yeah, every aircraft
we operate is augmented
with custom security
and design features
you won't find
in any other fleet.
I see that you're
an Embry-Riddle grad.
ATP-certified,
1,600 verified FAA hours.
Clearly well qualified,
Mr. Green.
Flying's in my blood.
I started working on my Grandpa's
crop duster when I was 10.
Now you understand
that we charter
exclusively
to top executives
and celebrity clients,
so absolute discretion
is a must for our flight crew.
Hey, anything past
getting the plane
safely from "A to "B"
is none of my business.
Good, of course, finding
out everything we can
about the people who are piloting
our planes is our business.
And according
to your visa records,
you spent a little time in the
Middle East over the last few years.
14 months in Afghanistan, 6 in Iraq.
But you were never military?
I worked for an
independent contractor.
Left that off the resum.
I didn't think
it was relevant.
State Department has you
flagged as a person of interest.
I'm an interesting guy.
There was an incident.
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
Which contractor
were you working with
when this
incident occurred?
One of the big ones.
- Halliburton, Blackwater?
- You said discretion was a must.
Look, I'm going to be straight with you.
I think there's room in our operation
for someone like you,
but there is no way
that I can hire you if you
are unable to clear this up.
Do you understand that?
Thank you for your time.
<i>The president is scheduled
to address the nation tomorrow
<i>amid growing disapproval.
<i>Recent polls show his rating
plunging double digits
<i>into the 20s,
even amongst partisan voters.
<i>With midterm elections
on the horizon,
<i>this is not a good sign
for the administration.
I've already been
summoned, Sarah.
They want me in position.
This is good news.
We talking locally
or back to the farmland?
I'm waiting to hear.
Congratulations.
It was your idea.
I have to say that...
when they recruited me,
I thought I was prepared
for just about anything.
But nothing like this.
Well, that's because
nothing like this...
has ever happened before.
This is it.
Yes.
This is the moment
we've prepared for.
All the devices
have been secured.
The other cells are receiving
their instructions as we speak.
The target cities
have been confirmed.
Your routes have been scouted
and cleared.
We're ready.
The strike will go off tomorrow
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.
Take a look around you,
gentlemen.
These are the faces of the men
who will change the world.
Season 1 Episode 12
"The Day Before"
Transcript: swsub.com
Synchro: Loky
[ www.seriessub.com ]
- Hey, Dad, you got a second?
- Nope.
USAToday'shaving a contest
to find the top five
towns under 5,000.
I was thinking we
should submit Jericho.
Why, so some big
developer can come in
and start buying
the town up,
maybe turn Main Street
into a strip mall
with a half a dozen
coffee shops or so?
Dad, there are worse things in the world
- than vente frappuccinos.
- Speak English.
This could be a good thing.
The kind of headlines
that will bring out voters next month.
Son, I am not worried
about beating Gray Anderson.
The people of this town
have kept me in office
for over 20 years.
I will earn their votes
by doing the job
they hired me to do.
What are you guys doing here?
Your father missed
his checkup this morning
and April was nice enough
to take off
her lunch hour
to make a house call.
Well, sorry, Doc, but we're
gonna have to reschedule
- for sometime after the election.
- Johnston.
You're gonna do this
whether you like it or not.
I've had this terrible cold
and you've not been feeling
well for almost a week.
It's a bad one.
Half my staff
has come down with it.
Do you want to strip here
or would you like to go
somewhere a little less public?
My office.
That's my guy.
Yo, yo, how'd it go?
Well, Freddy...
so much for your lucky tie.
"Driver wanted.
Military experience.
Plus, travel opportunities."
Something tells me they're not
talking about the Bahamas.
I need a job.
You're no driver, man.
You're a pilot,
a freakin' good one.
Right now, all I am is broke.
Unless you want
to pay my rent for me.
Sorry?!
Tell you what I can do, though.
Set you up with a drink.
Oye! Mira!
Hit us up with a couple
of cervezas.
What's up with you
and the manners?
I know you didn't just whistle
for me like some dog.
- Oh, baby...
- Don't you "baby" me, baby.
You're the worst
tipper in here.
What, that ring on your finger,
that don't count?
Finally pulled
the trigger, Freddy?
- All right.
- You know it, baby.
Hey, she's got some
good-looking sisters.
Unless you're still all hung up
on that farm girl back in Iowa.
- Kansas.
- Same thing.
No, not the same thing.
Yeah. Hold on a second.
Don't go anywhere,
all right?
Where am I gonna go?
<i>Sarah, the schedule's changed.
It's happening tomorrow
during the President's address.
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can,
but there's something
I need to take care of.
You get everything together
and I'll meet you back as soon as I can.
Where are you going?
<i>To get my kids.
<i>Robert, there isn't enough time.
Robert!
Anna.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
He's a good man.
I don't know
how good he his, but...
he promised to take care of me.
- Call me crazy, I believe him.
- What's this?
My best man hitting
on my fiance?
Best man?
You gonna make me ask?
You're more a brother to me
than the one I grew up with.
Back at ya.
I'm happy to do it.
Got some more good news, too.
Uh, sweetie, will you...
will you give us
a moment to talk?
What if I told you
I got a gig lined up?
Eight weeks,
a hundred G's, all cash.
What kind of gig?
The kind we're good at.
Cargo run.
Quick in, quick out.
$30,000 up front,
$70,000 when it's done.
Where?
Afghanistan.
- No.
- Come on.
You've been looking
for work for what, six months?
We do this one gig
and we are set.
You could open that flight school.
Maybe go home, snag back that girl.
Why are you doing this to me?
I can't believe you'd even ask
after what we saw over there,
what we did.
All we did was
not get killed, J.
Innocent people died, Freddy.
Innocent people.
I see it every time
I close my eyes.
Which isn't too damn often
these days.
Well, we'll be smarter
this time, man.
You know that I got
your back, man.
I'm sorry.
You're on your own this time.
I can't go back there.
I'll tell you what, Jerry,
you agree
to sit down face to face,
I'll flip you a pair of
open day boxes at Wrigley.
No strings.
I swear on a stack
of cheddar dogs.
Great.
6:00 at The Pump Room.
See you there.
Chicago again?
Hey, teach, half day?
Feel like helping me
prepare a syllabus or...
grading 30 essays on
Orwell's Animal Farm?
No, I have a better idea.
Have a sub do that and come
to Chicago with me tonight.
That would send
a great message to my students.
I'll write a letter for you.
"Dear kids, sorry I can't teach
you ungrateful brats today.
"I'm with my fiance getting drunk
on draft beer and having
tons of Chicago-style sex."
I think it's Chicago-style pizza.
That, too.
One night.
Your students will catch up.
Book it.
Seriously?
You're not going to try
to talk me out of it now, are you?
No. I'm done talking.
<i>46 tackles, three sacks
<i>and a couple of interceptions...
You all right?
I'm worried
about Freddy.
You want a beer?
No.
I think he's in over
his head with something.
What are you talking about?
These guys started
coming around.
Like...
soldiers but not.
They, they came by
again after you left.
Well, he's a big boy.
He can hang out
with whoever he chooses.
It's not like that.
When he came back,
Freddy had a black eye, saying
he's going away for two months
and not to try to find him.
Tell him you don't want him to go.
You don't think I did that?
He says he doesn't
have a choice,
that he's doing it for me.
What do you want me to do?
Help him.
Go with him if you have to.
I know what he did for you
in Iraq.
I know you owe him your life.
Yeah.
That doesn't appear to be
worth very much, right now.
I'm pregnant, Jake.
I just...
I have a bad feeling
about all this.
- Robert, what...
- Don't make a scene.
What are you doing here?
You need to come with me.
Look, don't tell me
what to do.
You are not allowed
within 500 feet of this family.
Circumstances have changed, Darcy.
Mom!
Mom.
Oh, my God. The kids.
Unlock the door from the inside.
Alison, it's, it's okay.
It's okay.
You let them out of there right now,
or so help me,
I'll start screaming.
No, you listen to me
very carefully.
In five seconds,
I'm getting on this truck
and I am leaving
Washington for good.
And I did not come here
to discuss this with you.
Now you can
either trust me,
and come with us
or you can stay here.
But you will never ever
see your children again.
Hey, buddy, you in?
I'm in.
Glad you changed your mind.
I'm telling you,
this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Then how come this isn't the first time
I've heard you say that?
Do me a favor.
Skip ahead in your mind
a couple of months.
Visualize yourself on a...
Mexican beach,
knee deep in bikinis
and Benjamins.
I try not to think
that far ahead.
Keeps me from being disappointed
when things go to hell.
My pop once told me
if you don't keep an eye
towards where you're going,
you'll never get there.
Speaking of eyes...
You should see the other guy.
Fine, introduce us.
Who's the job for, Freddy?
Don't matter who.
They know you, and
your reputation.
I'm not going anywhere
until I know.
It's an offshoot of Ravenwood.
You'll meet 'em, tomorrow
right before we get on a plane.
In the meantime,
all you gotta worry about...
is this.
There's three times that
waiting for you
when this is over.
All we gotta do is
run a convoy through enemy territory
without getting killed.
How many times I gotta get your back
before you start believing it, huh?
Seat's all yours.
Thank you.
Yeah, I hate, I hate sitting when
I got money on a game.
<i>Swung on, it's a high
blast out toward left field.
<i>It's way back, and it is gone!
Mary Bailey, you owe me five bucks.
Pay up!
Better yet, better yet.
Buy my, uh,
good luck charm here,
a drink on me.
Don't waste your money,
I have an expense account.
What is your best wine?
Beer.
Vodka, rocks.
Did you know that it
is a three-hour cab ride
from the airport to
this godforsaken town?
Scenic, though, ain't it?
If you like corn.
Well, now,
who doesn't like corn?
I mean, you got
corn on the cob,
cornflakes, corn nuts,
corn dogs, cornsicles.
Cornsicles?
It's a joke, lady.
Can you not talk
to me, please?
Thank you.
- Corn, corn chips?
- Seriously.
Don't talk to me.
Bailey's.
<i>Hey, there.
Hi.
Am I going to see you this week?
<i>Well, you can see me right now.
<i>Just turn around.
<i>What are you doing here?
You have no idea
<i>how badly I want
to kiss you right now.
Well.
<i>Why don't you step
into my office?
What in the...
heck do we have here?
It's time for some changes, Johnston.
Starting with your diet.
A man can't live on that.
Can if he wants to
stay married to me.
Your blood pressure was ten
points over your last checkup.
Well, that's just the stress.
It's always up at election time.
Then drop out of the race.
What has gotten into you?
Something happened watching April
listen to your heartbeat.
I began to wonder.
How many good years do
we have left together?
Did you hear something I didn't?
'Cause all she told me was
I might be getting a cold.
This isn't,
this isn't just about health,
yours or mine.
When you first took office
you made two oaths.
One to the people
of this town,
and the other one to me.
Do you rember
what you said?
Yeah.
That I would never let the job
come before you and the kids.
I'm just asking
for equal time.
I hear you, honey.
You all stay put.
Mom, do something.
Robert, let us go.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'll be back
in five minutes.
- And then what?
- And then...
we leave town.
Oh, you're crazy,
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Dad, stop. Dad!
Let go of her,
Robert!
Listen to me, okay.
I would never do
anything to hurt you,
your mother, or your brother.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
I barely know you.
Listen, Robert,
you are scaring Samuel.
Unscare him, Darcy.
Do you have your cell phone?
No, he took it when
he picked me up.
Not mine.
Really?
Where is it, honey?
In my backpack.
<i>911. What is your emergency?
The door was unlocked.
I love what you've done
with the place.
What do you want, Agent Hicks?
Guess whose name
just popped up
on an international
passenger manifest?
You got me on
a no-fly list now?
No, not yet, but...
I thought maybe...
we could work out a deal.
You're about to get into bed
with some very bad people, Jake.
Lucky for you,
your timing is perfect.
We're looking to nail Ravenwood.
They did that?
They've been running weapons
since the start of the war.
They'll sell arms to anybody,
even our enemies.
We need someone working for us
that they'll
consider credible.
And why would I
say yes to you?
Because...
...you know firsthand
what they're capable of.
Sarah, come on, we don't have...
Sarah?
Hold it right there.
Drop the case.
Walk towards me slowly.
Put your hands in the air... now!
This your truck?
It's a rental.
Moving day, you know?
What seems to
be the problem?
Open the back.
Okay.
What the hell?
Cuff him.
Hands behind your back.
Help! Help!
Unlock the door.
- Please.
- It's okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.
- Can you open this door?
- We can't.
Can you unlock the door.
Watch out!
Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Eric.
- Mary.
Oh, darlin', would you get him
a beer, too?
Sure thing.
Thanks.
So, um...
Why did I ask you here?
Yeah. Is everything okay?
Uh, your mother and I have been...
talking about the next
chapter in our lives.
Be more accurate, she's...
pointing out how I seem to be
unwilling to turn the page.
Sounds like Mom.
When I first took office,
you were in... what? Third grade?
Second.
My team won the pee-wee
football trophy that year.
I scored two touchdowns
in the championship game.
Hard to remember
back that far.
Maybe because
you didn't make the game, Dad.
Right.
Well,
your mother is afraid that if I keep
going the way I'm going,
we're gonna wind up
missing more than
pee-wee football.
And I've been
thinking about it,
and I want to ask
you a question.
If I decided to drop
out of the race,
would you consider
running in my place?
What?
You'd make a good candidate, son.
You've been here
your whole life, you live clean,
unlike your brother Jake.
Plus, selfishly, I'd get to...
step down and still have some influence
over how things were run.
Oh, y-you're serious?
Well, you...
You're smart, you're decisive.
Even got yourself a law degree.
Which I plan on using some day.
Plan on doing a lot
of things some day.
Nothing you've
been sharing with me.
Let me know if you
need anything else.
So, you take the night
and think about it.
Talk to April about it.
It's gonna effect her, too.
Yeah.
Hey.
- What's up?
- We need to talk.
What's up?
Cargo, we're transporting
for Ravenwood,
you have any idea what it is?
- I don't ask those kind of questions, man.
- Stinger Missiles. RPGs.
It's not like this was ever some
kind of humanitarian mission.
They've been selling them
to the insurgents, Freddie
They'll be used to kill our own guys!
The Feds are on
to the whole thing.
They want us to help
take down Ravenwood.
Are you crazy?
We don't have a choice.
They're watching us.
So is Ravenwood, man.
I'm more worried about them
than the government.
If we don't work with the Feds,
they'll make sure
Ravenwood believes you are.
- You got your money with you?
- What?
- Your money.
- Yeah, I can get it.
Get Anna, grab whatever you can,
we'll meet in an hour.
- Then what?
- We'll take off tonight.
If they come after us, at least
we'll have a head start.
All right?
Nobody from school
better see us.
Gonna make it pretty hard for me
to get on that plane tonight
and call in sick tomorrow.
You know, if this was Chicago,
you could walk for miles
without ever running
into anyone you know.
Really? Chicago again?
Plus, there's the pizza,
the Cubs, the culture...
What are you getting at, huh?
Okay, I have a confession.
The meeting tomorrow
isn't just a meeting.
It's an interview for a startup
venture capital firm.
Final interview,
actually.
Are you serious?
Well, I thought maybe you could
get to know the city a little.
You might fall in love with it.
You're a jerk.
Emily, we have to at
least talk about it.
We have talked about this.
This is not the kind of opportunity
you can just say no to.
Really?
No.
There. How hard is that?
I cannot believe you.
We're supposed to be married
in a few months.
Why do you think I'm doing this?
Because you're selfish,
and you don't listen.
I told you when you proposed to me
I didn't want to move.
Now you go behind my back like this?
Yeah, well, screw me for thinking
you might be open
to changing your mind.
I mean, what is it about
this town that's got you so...
addicted to it?
This town is my history.
It is everything
that I know and love.
It's where I want
my kids to grow up.
If you don't understand that,
then maybe...
Maybe what?
I'm not getting on that plane
with you tonight.
If you decide to take that job tomorrow,
then don't bother coming back.
I'm tired.
Allison,
there are two bedrooms
upstairs.
Take your brother up to the one
on the right. That's where you'll sleep.
Who's stuff is all this?
Who lives here?
We do.
Go on upstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.
Come on, Sammy.
I'll read to you.
I don't know what's going on, Robert,
and right now, I'm...
I'm too exhausted to fight,
but I promise you one thing.
Come tomorrow,
one way or another,
I will have you arrested.
But you know, come tomorrow,
a whole lot of things
will be different.
Freddie, come here.
- All right. What happened?!
- Ravenwood.
Those sons a bitches shot me!
Oh, God!
Take it easy,
take it easy.
Find Anna.
Make sure she's all right.
First, we got to get
you to the hospital.
All I care about
is Anna and my kid.
Get them on that bus.
Then you get the hell
out of here, too!
They're gonna come after you.
Oh, they're coming after you.
Try to stay with me.
<i>911. What is your emergency?
I need an ambulance right away.
My friend's been shot,
he's lost a lot of blood.
<i>Is he breathing?
Stay with me, Freddie!
<i>Sir, is he breathing?
Stay with me, man.
Come on, man, stay with me.
You're all right.
You're all right.
Stay with me.
I can't believe he's gone.
I'm really sorry.
It's not your fault. You did...
You did everything that you could.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
It belonged to Freddie.
Use it for the baby.
My family will help me.
You keep it.
No.
I promised him.
Just put it away.
<i>Platform for Houston.
Platform six.
You better go.
Come with me.
Come on,
you can start over, too.
No, I can't. Not yet.
Then where will you go?
You were up early.
Oh, I've been coughing all night.
I didn't want to wake you.
Paris.
I hate France.
I'm sure they'd be
devastated to hear it.
Studied French and Italian
for four years.
After all those years,
all I can remember is my name,
how to count to ten and,
"Would you please pass
that packet of sugar?"
Book the trip.
I don't think they take reservations
six years in advance.
I was thinking
more like Christmas.
What the hell.
Book one for Italy, too.
<i>Hello.
<i>Hello?
<i>Is anybody there?
<i>Hello?
Jake.
<i>One new message.
Hey, Emily, it's Roger.
Just tried your cell,
but I couldn't reach you.
Hopefully, you haven't run off
with the milkman yet.
Last night was terrible.
I kept wanting to...
get up and tell the captain
I'd made a horrible mistake,
and to turn the plane around.
My home is where you are, babe.
And if that means Jericho, Kansas
for the rest of my life,
it'll be a happy one.
I'm flying back tonight.
I get into Wichita at 10:30.
I can't think of anything
I'd rather see
than your beautiful face
when I get home.
And in case you're wondering, I...
I didn't go on that interview.
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, it's you.
Yeah, sorry, not ringing a bell.
Look, I have been standing out
here forever waiting for a cab.
Yeah, I suggest you nicely
ask someone for a ride.
Do you know where
the Richmond Farm is?
Well, yeah, I ought to.
I'm Stanley Richmond.
- You got to be kidding.
- No.
You see, now is the part
where you tell me your name.
Mimi Clark.
Really? Well, it's...
nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.
Do you not read your mail?
Nope. Nothing but bills
and bad news. Why?
Well, this would be a little of both.
I work for the IRS.
And according to our records,
you owe more than $180,000
in back taxes.
It's nice to meet you.
<i>Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.
<i>We all know that
these divisions pale in comparison
<i>to the fundamental dangers posed
by the threat of terrorism.
<i>We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world
<i>a better place for our children
and grandchildren.
<i>This has always been our promise.
Not another step.
Where are my kids?
Give me the keys.
Darcy, put that gun down,
'cause you don't even
know how to use it.
I don't want to shoot you, Robert,
but so help me, I'm prepared to!
Now, give me the keys!
<i>Mom! Mom, come quick!
Baby, stay outside!
<i>Mom! Mom!
Something's happening!
<i>Woody, what are you looking at?
Jake!
Jake, we got
to go outside!
Now!
<i>Help them.
Help them.
Bring them inside.
Some of them were on planes.
Landed in the middle of nowhere.
Been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
<i>Can you give me
a hand with this?
Oh, my God.
Roger.
Is it really you?
I thought you were dead.
Come on. Come with me.
We only have another half hour
before the generators shut down.
Well, I'm sure they'll
make an exception.
Do we have any extra blankets?
I already brought everything
down I could find. Listen, Eric,
these people need medical attention.
You have to find a doctor.
I'm okay.
Are there any more people out there?
We could send a search party.
21 men
and 32 women.
I'll do a head count.
What happened to you out there?
We waited in that field
for two days
after our plane went down.
No one came.
Eventually, I...
went for help.
I walked for...
I don't how long.
Wound up in this...
refugee camp.
Nebraska.
Most of us are from there.
I can't imagine
what you've seen out there.
Roger?
I said, I can't imagine
what you've seen.
Couldn't have
imagined it either.
Hey, wash up.
Dinner's almost ready.
Robert?
Darcy,
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while
until I can sort something out.
What does that mean?
It means you stay inside,
and you don't answer the door.
Here.
We're playing football.
Man, Sam,
that is really cool.
Daddy's gonna put that
on the fridge.
Sam, I want you to go upstairs,
tell your sister dinner's ready.
Okay? Right now.
<i>Allison!
Are we in danger, Robert?
I've asked you that question
a thousand times,
you've always said no.
I don't...
mean to scare you, D.
All right, we'll do
whatever you say.
I trust you.
My God. Where did
they all come from?
I'm gonna need warm water,
as much as you can make.
I've made a list of the injured.
How's he doing?
I think he might be in shock.
He doesn't want to be treated
until everybody else
has been seen.
- Jake, I, um...
- Go.
He's gonna need you.
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.
<i>You need to keep them
clean and warm.
Do you have a place to stay?
Do you know anyone
in Jericho?
Actually...
I do.
<i>Previously on Jericho.</i>
So I hear you and I
are going to be partners now.
Where'd you get that?
You're running the store,
you're going to need protection.
Don't make the same mistake
that Gracie made.
Or those people out there
are going to be putting
flowers and candles
on the sidewalk for you.
Who the hell is that?
Remember,
the gas tank on this thing
is on the left-hand side,
so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you,
make sure it's not on that side.
Okay. Anything else?
So, are we going to see you
for Thanksgiving?
Well, I think Mary and I
are going to spend it together.
Well, you're always welcome.
Thanks, but I don't want to put
you guys in an awkward position.
You could have thought of that before
you moved in with your mistress
and left your wife with us.
Some of them were on planes
that landed in the middle of nowhere.
They've been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
Oh, my God.
Is it really you?
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while
until I can sort something out.
Are we in danger, Robert?
You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.
You need to keep them
clean and warm.
Do you have a place to stay?
Do you know anyone in Jericho?
Actually,
I do.
It's freezing in here, too.
Mr. Bintner?
Mr. Bintner?
Joe?
The temperature dropped so fast.
It's going to be a long winter.
All right, everyone!
Everyone, please!
Please!
Right now,
we're using the generator
to power the town hall
for three hours a day,
and the Med Center for six.
And this is how much fuel we have,
and this is how much we need
to get us through the winter.
At current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel
in two weeks.
I wonder when the dancing girls show up.
Stop.
There's a way of doing this without
scaring the crap out of everybody.
He was elected.
Guess he's going to do it his way.
I'm going to need a hobby.
So here's what we're working on.
All right, we got
organized firewood crews...
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Yeah.
There's a woman
in that group of refugees
that Bill is processing,
I think you should talk to her.
Why?
She said she used to be
a cop in Saint Louis.
Especially with 53
new people among us,
we have got to start rethinking things,
fast,
or the people we lost last night
won't be the only casualties
of this coming winter.
What about the windmills?
She's right.
Wind power.
We should be building windmills.
Harry?
I think you all know Harry Carmichael,
our chief engineer
down at the mine.
We've been looking into wind turbines
for weeks now with Mayor Green.
But in order to build anything
that can be connected to the grid,
it's going to take time.
Time I'm not sure we can afford.
- She's in here.
- Thanks, Jimmy.
Hello, Rob.
Any parts we don't have...
we simply don't have
the maching capabilities.
What kind of parts?
Mechanical governors to regulate output.
With the EMP damage, we're figuring
out a lot of this from scratch.
- It's still a long way off.
- Black Jack Fairgrounds.
We walked through it
on our way back here.
It's become a trading post.
People from all over
the region are trading...
food, information,
machine parts.
They may have what we need.
That's got to be a 200-mile drive.
That's a lot of gas for a "maybe."
If we can get one windmill working,
we'd save that much gas in a month.
If we get enough of them,
we could be off gas for good.
It might not be a bad idea
to put a small party together
and go check it out.
Is anyone interested
in volunteering?

I know it was you.
- What?
- Those men that grabbed me.
They said that someone
on my team sold us all out.
They said it was you.
And you believe them?
Tell me why I shouldn't.
Come on!
You're smart enough to know
that they will say anything
to get you to talk.
Because you know
I owe you my life
as much as you owe me yours
and because you just...
You just punched me in the face,
and I didn't hit you back.
- Who else is here?
- No one.
Victor showed up
just after D-day.
But he only made it
for a couple of hours.
Did you kill him?
It was the radiation...
from Denver.
No one else made it back here
to the rally point?
You going to tell me
how you got out of that room?
Three armed guys, cuffs.
Three guys and cuffs
keep you in that room?
One of them got too close.
Then there was only two.
Two was easy.
From there,
I drove as fast as I could.
Saw the clouds
from D. C. and Baltimore.
Ran out of gas in West Virginia.
Went from refugee camp
to refugee camp
however I could.
I'm glad you made it.
You left me.
I know.
So what now?
We caught wind of some raiding parties
at interchanges here and here.
But if you're careful,
you should be safe
the rest of the way.
Once you're at Black Jack,
watch your back.
Thieves?
It's not the thieves you got
to worry about, it's the guards.
They've got a reputation
of being really ruthless.
Without the cops
or the National Guard,
it's the only way they
guaranteed it's safe enough
to keep commerce going there.
You'd better take two or three
of the border patrol guys with you.
Just in case you run
into any surprises.
I'm coming, too.
Not a chance in hell.
Would you know
a working mechanical governor
for a wind turbine
if you saw one?
I'm not taking
passengers out there.
Jake, Mr. Carmichael has a family.
I can help.
You need me.
Mrs. Green?
What?
Eric told me that
April's pregnant.
I just...
- If there's anything that I can do...
- Mary...
I think you've done quite enough.
Always got to be the first one
to jump in the fire, don't you?
Somebody's got to go.
Yeah, well, just seems
that someone is always you.
Gray's having a few bags of salt
packed up for us to trade.
Smart.
Who else is going?
Apparently Heather.
Gray thinks I should take
a couple of guys from border patrol.
That's it?
I'm not so sure
pulling them off patrol
just to watch my back
is such a good idea.
Besides, only a handful of them
even know what they're doing.
You don't think
I can watch your back?
Why? You want to go?
Look, you've already seen
what it's like out there. I just...
need to see it for myself.
Besides, I'm unemployed.
I'm not obsolete.
Did you ask Mom?
Son, I am 59 years old.
I was mayor of this town
since the Carter administration.
I'm a retired U. S. Army Ranger
and a combat veteran.
Of course I asked your mother.
I could go downstairs and...
warm some water
for a bath for you.
I didn't think I was ever
going to finish this.
Hey, uh...
we have a guest.
This is Sarah.
Hey, Dale?
Hey. What are you
doing back there?
Uh, inventory.
Is it that bad?
Well, Mr. Houghton just showed up
with Mrs. Leigh's cut of the produce.
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, exactly.
Well, did you point out
that it's rotten?
They're all screwing me.
Hardly anyone's honoring their deals.
My dad used to have to deal with stuff
like this all the time
down at the salt mine.
- Well, how did he do it?
- He just...
did whatever it took
to keep things running.
I'm not shutting this place down.
Actually,
I may have
good news about that.
But you might have
to take a little trip.
I need to talk to you.
All right.
I shouldn't have sprung this on you.
This is too weird...
What? What's weird?
I kissed you.
A month ago.
And we haven't spoken since.
Generally, people speak
after something like that.
I'm just going to...
You know...
I know, I'm, uh...
- I'm sorry, really...
- You don't have to apologize.
I'm not upset.
I understand
why it happened.
Look, I want to go
because I think I can help get
this place back up on its feet.
That's it.
It's not a date.
Mr. Mayor?
I'm not the mayor anymore, Dale.
What is it?
I need to come with you.
I want to take it all.
Trade it for something
I can actually use
to build this store up again.
Whatever I don't use,
I'll put towards
supplies the town needs.
You're just going to give it
away to the town for nothing?
It's the right thing to do, isn't it?
I just want to help.
Well,
this is one hell of a crew
we're putting together here.
All right.
Yeah, we'll leave
first thing in the morning.
You just happen to know
someone who just...
happened to wander into town?
Look at me.
I'm not going to lie to you.
But I can't...
I can't tell you any more
than I already have.
So she's a friend, okay?
The last time you let someone
from that part of your life
- into our home, it was 4 years ago.
- This is different.
Well, you couldn't tell me
who he was.
But you told me not to worry.
Two weeks later, you left.
I didn't see you again
until two months ago.
This is different.
Sam cried for weeks.
I mean, he was four-years-old.
He didn't understand why
you'd want to leave him.
I just...
I don't know if I can watch him
go through that again.
What is going on here?
Come here.
What is this?
So I'm being watched.
By who?
My guess...
The Old Man.
Why...?
You still have the package, don't you?
He's been coordinating
this thing from the beginning,
feeding us information.
Why would he turn on us now?
I don't know.
You still have
a way to reach him?
And have you...
told him that you
made contact with me yet?
- Not yet.
- Then do it.
You do it...
and you see what he says.
"Thieves will be strung up."
We need your guns.
Pick them up on the way out.
Go ahead.
They're kidding about
the "strung up" thing, right?
They don't mean that literally.
Looks like everyone
checks in here at the main tent.
They try and match
buyers and sellers.
They gave me three
possibilities of sellers
that might have the part
for the windmill.
It's like eBay.
Not like eBay.
All right, look, um...
see if you can find the governor,
I'm going to stick with Dale.
See what he can trade for.
Let's do this thing quick
then we're out of here.
Morning.
Good morning.
Last night,
you fell asleep mid-sentence.
- I did?
- Yes, you did.
Standing up right there
at the sink, shaving.
You were going to tell me
what you've seen out there and...
Roger, I...
I don't want to push.
I can't even imagine how awful
it was for you out there. I just...
A lot of it was.
Listen.
If I tell you something,
will you promise not to think...
I've lost it?
Of course.
Out there...
I saw... something.
I haven't told
anybody about it. I...
can't explain it.
The thing is...
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
From there I ended up
in a tent city outside of Lexington.
So, what are they like?
The camps?
Each is, uh... different.
Some are overcrowded, dangerous.
Some are better run.
Did you see people
with radiation poisoning?
Some, yes.
What do they look like?
Lots of burns,
tissue loss, some vomiting.
Allie, Sam.
Upstairs.
How do you know my dad?
We worked together.
Do you know how
to play football?
Of course, I do.
Doesn't everybody?
Not everybody.
Hey, Samuel, now.
Come on.
You know, these kids
have been through enough.
I... I'm sorry.
Look, I don't know you.
I really don't want to.
I know the kind of people
my husband works with.
No matter how close
the two of you are,
I don't need my kids
exposed to that world.
I've been married to
this man a long time.
I got pretty good at reading
between the lines.
Thanks, Mary.
Why don't you and I sit down
together and have a drink?
Hey, how much?
- Beg pardon?
- How much?
How much for what?
I don't know.
An hour?
An hour of what?
Wait, what?! No!
- How about a half hour?
- Is everything all right?
- I'm not a hooker, pal!
- Then what are you doing here?
All right, that's enough.
That's enough, man.
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey, no. No.
No problem. Everything's fine.
No kidding, buddy.
You don't want to mess with
the guards here, it gets ugly, fast.
Thanks for the help.
Heather.
Oh, my God, Ted.
I can't believe you're here.
Jake, this is Ted Lewis.
We grew up together
over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
I was so worried about you.
We were going to send a party
to make contact with you guys,
but the roads were
just so dangerous.
What are you guys doing here?
We're looking for parts
for a windmill generator.
Unsuccessfully.
Hey, there's a guy
we deal with here...
who doesn't always
report to the main tent,
but sometimes he's got
those specialty items
nobody else has.
You want to see him?
- Yeah, let's check it out.
- All right.
Get this stuff out of here
before somebody sees it.
Why, what's wrong with it?
Nickel...
the silver stuff
is all alloyed with it.
So?
So nickel absorbs radioactivity.
Stuff that's been looted
from hot zones
is making a lot of people sick.
No one wants it.
This stuff was nowhere
near the fallout.
Look, kid,
if I can't sell it, I can't sell it.
What do you want me to tell you?
What else do you got?
So what does have value here?
Not much of what you got.
Check the board over there.
Why salt?
It's a preservative.
An antibiotic.
You need 1,500 milligrams
of it a day to survive.
The Romans actually
used it as currency.
Whole African empires
were based on the control
and supply of it.
Wars have been fought over salt.
Food, medical supplies,
a generator, all air-dropped,
all from China.
What?
Yeah, we got an airdrop, too.
The thing is...
it was from Germany.
It's aid. It must be coming
from all over the world.
Well, if aid's coming
from all over the world then...
who did this to us?
A group of thugs a few weeks back,
guys claiming to be
government contractors.
So the mayor thought
we should make security a priority.
He resigned his office and...
appointed Sheriff Constantino
acting city manager.
The contractors,
who were they?
A security detail from a...
company called Ravenwood.
They came in looking for supplies.
A few of the shop owners resisted
and they got violent.
They killed three,
they injured eight.
They drove off with
a truckload of our diesel.
But since then,
the sheriff's managed to
keep control of things.
Crime really isn't a
problem for us anymore.
How'd he manage that?
- What is this?
- The news.
Where does all this come from?
People pass through here
from all over.
Everyone brings
a little piece of the puzzle.
Do you have
something to write on?
You guys don't
get out much, do you?
It gets better.
What are the stars for?
Capitals.
Of what?
The federal government.
Federal government? But...
There are six stars up there.
Where's the president?
Which one?
Six presidents, I...
I don't understand.
Who's in charge of the military?
You're assuming
there's only one of those, too.
All right, come on, let's go.
Isn't there a line of succession,
so there's only one successor?
The word is HHS.
Secretary Charles is supposed
to be next in line,
but there are five other guys
who seem to think
the attacks changed the rules.
Senator Morrisette in Oregon,
Senator Tomarchio in Wyoming...
They're all staking a claim,
gathering support.
Then what happens?
How do they figure out who's in charge?
Either they start making deals,
- compromise...
- Or?
Or they fight.
Six bags of soybean seed,
and still it's...
It's not enough.
Maybe this whole thing
was a bad idea.
It's a start.
Dale, wait up.
It'd be a lot easier for you
to close the store, wouldn't it?
But instead, you're out here
trying to keep it going.
I think Gracie
would be proud of you.
I think your mom would
be proud of you, too.
When my mom died,
there was nothing I could do about it.
But then after Mrs. Leigh...
Mitchell Cafferty
is going to get his due
whether Gray finds him or not.
Sooner or later, he's going
to cross the wrong person.
One of these days,
it's going to catch up with him.
I don't like to drink
while I'm working.
To be honest, I have
difficulty understanding
how many ways I dislike you.
You made a list?
Mrs. Green, I don't think I...
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there
and listen to what
I have to say.
What you and Eric
did to April was awful.
But she's going
to get through this
because she is
one strong woman.
But there's a baby on the way,
and it happens
to be my grandchild.
And I intend to do
everything I can
to protect it from this world.
But what you've done,
I can't protect it from.
You've divided the family.
And as hard as that child's
life was going to be,
you have made it
so much more difficult.
I don't think that's something
I'll ever be able to forgive.
When I was a kid,
my mom split on my dad and I.
She left with the guy
she met in Denver...
This isn't about you.
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there
and listen to what I have to say.
I lay awake at night
terrified that I have
put April in the same
position my dad was in...
Terrified that I have put this child
in the same position that I was in.
My mistake was falling
in love with your son,
I never should have let
it happen, but I did.
I know the cost.
I know how wrong it is.
But the problem is,
he loves me, too.
And I don't know
how you undo that.
So if you want
to go on hating me,
if you never accept me...
I can't say as I blame you.
So I went to find help.
I was more messed up
than I thought.
I wandered for days.
Eventually...
passed out in this... field.
So there I was,
the middle of Nebraska
feeling like that was the place
I was going to die.
And then,
the strangest thing happened.
There was a...
light in the sky.
A bright light with a...
ring around it.
I...
went... towards it.
Two miles later...
I stumbled into
the refugee camp.
That light...
saved my life.
Been looking all over for you.
Did you find the part?
I think so.
Did you see the news?
You looking to trade
for a mechanical governor?
Okay, let's talk trade.
Eight bags of salt
at 35 pound per.
Russell, what did they think?
That they're the first ones
to think of this?
These parts are in high demand.
I'm not giving it away.
- What more is it going to take?
- What more?
I turned away a guy
just this morning,
and he offered 80 gallons
of diesel for the thing.
Listen...
We have more salt
than you can imagine.
We have the largest
salt mine for 400 miles
and we've got men to mine it.
But if you ever want
to see any of it,
we need to make
this deal right now, today.
You understand?
Okay, listen,
I'll vouch for him.
All right?
All right.
We got a deal.
Wait here. I'll go get it.
These things aren't
easy to make, you know.
Not the good ones anyway.
Dad, this is Russell.
Hi. Good to meet you.
Mr. Mayor?
No kidding, Dale,
I am not the mayor anymore.
There's blood on them.
- You need some help there?
- What the hell is this?
Are you conducting an inspection
or are we doing a deal?
No, we're not supporting that.
We'll find another solution.
Well, then we're all done here,
aren't we?
Why don't you get out?
Get out of here.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
You, too!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Guys, I'm so sorry.
We had no idea.
We need that part.
- And we're going to have to figure out
a way... - Where's Dale?
Dale, where'd you get off to?
Don't just wander off like that.
Did you steal that?
He's a bad guy.
He can't get away with that.
We got to get that back before
they realize it's missing.
It's okay I went out
the back. No one saw me.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hand him over.
He made a mistake, all right?
He'll give back what he took.
It's no harm done, all right?
Excuse me. You know,
he really is sorry and
the property is back
where it belongs.
He can explain it to management.
I'm just asking you,
use a little discretion,
that's all, please.
Excuse me, but could I talk
to whoever's in charge here?
Look, old man, I told you...
That's enough!
How long have you been
with the FBI?
14 years.
Started right out of college.
It's dangerous out there, isn't it?
I don't think your mom wants me
talking to you about that.
I'm not a kid.
It's pretty bad.
My dad's been teaching me
how to shoot.
I wonder if that's why.
He's been teaching you
how to shoot?
A little.
I'm not sure if I like it.
It's a weird feeling, but...
it's the first time I can remember
the two of us actually doing
something together.
Where's your father?
It's the old man.
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.
He knows where you are.
We need to go.
We need to move now.
No, I don't know.
You don't know?
This country is going
to be what we make of it.
There are only a
handful of other people
that know what we know.
We have to keep fighting.
We have to stay alive.
We go see him, and if,
if he is behind this,
we take him out.
Take him out?
Yeah, I mean,
how long can we run?
How long can my family run?
We pay him a visit,
we eliminate the threat.
We go straight at him, there is
a chance we don't come back.
You're leaving.
She walked in that door,
I knew right away you'd be leaving.
You have nothing to worry about.
It's not me that
I'm worried about.
Our children need a father.
Whatever you're going to do,
it can't be more important than that.
Do you trust her?
I have to.
If she's a threat to this
family's safety,
if she's a threat to you...
you kill her.
You understand?
Get in!
Hurry!
Stop the car.
Jake, this car will not fit
through that barricade.
Stop the car now!
Thanks. I, uh,
I don't know how this would have
turned out if it weren't for you guys.
- Well, you'll make it up to us someday.
- However we can help.
Those windmills you're looking
to build... I was thinking.
Guys down at the
old brake assembly,
maybe they can convert
part of their plant,
help build what you need.
I know the town could use
a good source of salt.
Looks like we're going
to be seeing a lot of each other.
- Thanks again, guys. Take care.
- Thank you so much.
What?
Jake, I saw the governor.
I saw how it's put together.
I was talking to Ted,
and I think between the two of us,
we can help to make more of them,
but I have to go with him.
- Go with them? Wait a minute.
- No, think about it.
We don't have the resources
to do this the right way.
They've got the machines
and the guys who
know how to use them.
With a dozen full-sized windmills,
you could power the whole town,
run the med center,
forget about gas.
You're just going to leave?
Right now?
It won't be for very long.
Just a few days.
But I know I can help.
I think I need to do this.
You think this is a good idea?
You know why things
didn't work out between us?
I'm not dangerous.
I'm crossword puzzles
and flannel pajamas and
the occasional lite beer.
I was never going to be
hazardous to you.
- That's how you tick.
- No, it isn't.
Of course it is.
But it's okay.
If it wasn't, your dad would
probably be dead right now,
you and I would have
never met on that bus.
So I'm taking a page out of your book.
I'm throwing caution to the wind.
I'm gonna help turn the lights
on for everyone back home.
Just for a few days.
You worried about me?
Come back in one piece.
Dad?
We're out of the good toothpaste.
Oh, well, here's the...
The new stuff that Mr. Daley made.
- This isn't toothpaste.
- Yeah, it is.
Are you playing a joke on me?
Hey, you know, uh,
when you were teething,
you never cried.
See, 'cause most babies,
they cry, but not you.
And your...
mom was worried and the...
doctors were worried,
but not me.
Because I knew you weren't sick,
you weren't hurt,
you were just brave.
'Cause you're
the bravest person I know.
You always have been.
Dad?
What are you talking about?
Sam,
I have to go to work tomorrow.
It's a very important meeting,
but it's quite far away,
so I might not be back
for a day or two,
and I just wanted you to know that.
Are you mad at me?
What?
You're leaving.
You listen to me.
There is nothing that
you, your sister or your mother
could ever do that would
make me want to leave you.
I, uh...
I, I love you.
You understand that, right?
Hey, welcome home.
Success?
- You get the part?
- We had it...
and we lost it.
Uh, where's Heather?
Getting the lights back on.
You do realize that
what happened today
was unnecessary?
And stupid?
You got a lot
of responsibility now.
You're going to have to learn
how to be smart.
I understand.
And you,
you knew that this car
was not going to fit
through that gate?
I know.
I heard you talking to me,
and I knew you were right.
Why didn't you stop the car?
I don't know.
What'd you get?
Look at all this stuff.
Oh, you did great.
This is nothing.
Skylar, how much of the salt mine
does your family own?
I don't know. Why?
'Cause I think we may be rich.
You okay?
Look, uh...
I am glad you made it.
We leave first thing
in the morning.

<i>Bring them inside.</i>
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>

the middle of nowhere.</i>
<i>They've been walking
for weeks.</i>
<i>They must have gone
through hell.</i>
<i>Oh, my God... Roger.</i>
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>
<i>You need to keep
them clean and warm.</i>
<i>Do you know anyone
in Jericho?</i>
<i>Actually... I do.</i>
<i>Hello, Rob.</i>
<i>We're using the generator
to power the town hall</i>
<i>for three hours a day,
the Med Center for six.</i>
<i>With 53 new people, at current
levels of consumption...</i>
<i>we will be completely out
of gas and diesel in two weeks.</i>
<i>- Mrs. Green?
- What?</i>
<i>Eric told me that
April's pregnant.</i>
<i>It's the Old Man.</i>
<i>He's coming for us
using us against each other.</i>
<i>We go see him and if,
if he is behind this,</i>
<i>We take him out.</i>
<i>We leave first thing
in the morning.</i>
<i>Any luck out there?</i>
Sorry, ma'am.
Nothing?
Not even rabbits?
Never seen anything
like it before.
Nothing moving out there.
Think it was the fallout? Maybe it was
the radiation that killed the deer.
There'd still be dead animals,
carcasses, something.
I mean, it was weird.
Like all the game had vanished.
How far out
did you go?
15 miles out by Mill Pond
along the creek there.
Guess we're going to have
to drive, huh, Jake?
Yeah, but we have to be careful
about burning the gas rations
in the middle of winter.
We need everything we can
to run the generator.
We can live without
power for now.
Make fires to stay warm.
But we won't see Spring
if we don't eat.
Stanley and I will have to use
whatever gas we can spare.
and go out west,
Go out as far as it takes.
The rest of the hunting parties
will have to scrounge around locally.
Yeah, and Mimi's coming
with us.
What?
Well, in case something happens to me,
I want to make sure she knows...
how to trap and shoot, okay?
Look, the further you get
the hairier the roads are.
With food being
as scarce as it is,
there's bound to be
some trouble out there.
That sleeping bag's
rated to 40 below
and here's a wind-proof lighter for you.
You're going to need them both.
Good hunting.
I'm guessing the good folks
of Jericho don't know
about all this stuff down here.
- They don't know about a lot of things.
That'll be enough to get us
to the Old Man's place?
He is only about
two hours away.
I didn't realize
he was so close.
He chose the rally point.
Wanted it in his backyard.
How long as he been
watching you?
My guess...
since I stopped communications
a few days ago.
You worried about what we're
going to find out there?
- You're not.
- We can handle him.
It's you and me.
Let's get to work.
My grandmother
went fast than this
and she didn't
even have a car.
We have to take it easy,
we only have half a tank.
Well, hopefully we'll make it
to Flint Springs. It's got...
Hopefully? What do you
mean "hopefully"?
It's got a river.
It's prime white-tailed terrain.
I know, but...
This is crazy.
I told you that
I can't hunt.
Now you want me to kill Bambi.
You're gonna have to
learn, all right?
Everyone's doing their part.
Bonnie's been out twice.
Well, good for
frickin' Bonnie.
Bonnie grew up on farm.
The closest I ever got
to the outdoors
was the is the Ralph Lauren
section of Neiman Marcus.
There you go,
bargain hunting.
Same thing, but with a gun.
Bargains? At Neimans?
Sometimes I forget
that the biggest designer
in your closet is Wrangler.
What are you
laughing at?
I've never seen you in a
domestic squabble before.
Knock it off.
This isn't squabbling.
Oh, my God.
These dogs have tags.
Look at all this.
Wall Drugs.
Wall, South Dakota.
Do you think that's where all
these people were coming from?
Think about it.
South Dakota without heat,
electricity, or...
food being trucked in.
It's got to be even worse
in North Dakota,
Montana.
Oh, my God.
I read about this
at Blackjack.
Mass migration, hundreds...
maybe thousands of people
heading south.
Trying to outrun winter.
Should we be doing
that, too?

How far is it?
...60.
It's about 60 yards.
So 60 yard with almost
1.5 people per yard.
That's 90.
That's almost 100 people
just across.
The way the ground
is trampled,
you got to figure five
or tens times that amount
of people came through here.
Almost a thousand people?
Where are they going?
South Texas, Mexico.
Anyplace warmer.
It'd take weeks
to get there by foot.
God know how many thousand
people have the same idea.
Mexico's borders
could be closed.
We don't even know if
there still is a Mexico.
Maybe we should try
to catch on with them.
We can barely feed ourselves,
let alone... hundreds more.
We got to keep going.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Hey. Glad you came down.
Thank you.
- What time did you, uh...
- Early...
late, I guess.
I didn't want to wake you,
you looked so peaceful.
Peaceful? Really?
Did you have another one of those
bad dreams? Keep on there.
I guess neither one of
us got much sleep.
All I could do was think about
all these people down here, you know.
And then I remembered about the
clothes we had in the attic.
I thought that sweater
looked familiar.
Yeah, that woman was on
layover in Kansas City
when the bombs went off,
Her husband and two kids
were waiting for her at home.
Where?
Denver.
I lead these people here.
For better or worse
this is their home now.
It's on me to make sure
they're taken care of.
Yeah, of course.
What can I do to help, huh?
Talk to them,
follow your instincts.
The truth is...
I'm winging this myself.
I'll be outside.
Here.
Should be back
before dark.
And if you're not?
Just tell me when I
should start to worry.
This is the last time,
okay?
After today
I'm here...
for good, huh?
Okay.
I'll hold you to that.
Hi, honey.
How'd it go this morning?
The whole thing
was a bust.
I'm sorry, hon.
Jake's out there now.
Hopefully he and Stanley
will have better luck
than I did.
Is April here?
No, she's at
the clinic.
She promised me
she'd take a nap.
I hope it is warmer in that
clinic than it is in this house.
I think this house has
dropped ten degrees
in the last hour.
Feels like a storm's
coming in.
We'd better seal up these
windows the best was we can.
Been going around collecting
old sheets and linens.
We'll shove them
underneath the doors.
Look what I found...
hidden in Jake's closet.
Lord knows how long
that's been there.
Well, at least he was
drinking the good stuff.
I used to hide the most awful
rotgut in the world
behind my mother's
china cabinet.
What do you think?
On an empty stomach?
I'll get the glasses.
Why would anyone destroy all this.
If they'd wanted it out of commission,
they could have just taken it.
Be worth a fortune after the E.M.P.
Maybe there wasn't time,
or maybe they didn't
care about this stuff.
- How long?
- A couple of days...
Give or take.
But we just heard
from him yesterday.
We heard from someone.
Remote uplink.
Somebody else using
his access codes.
Who could have done this?
Wager for the first kill.
I'm in for a dozen eggs.
Two hours chopping wood.
Tax return consultation.
Oh, how about
foot massages for a week?
For me, not for him.
We'll talk.
Stanley, stop.
- What are they doing?
- They're blocking the whole road.
More like staking it out.
All right, turn around.
And... and go where?
I don't know. Just do it, all right?
Turn around. We'll find another road.
I see it. Damn it.
Why are they following us?
Stanley, gun it!
This should get us
back to the highway.
Then what?
We try to make it back home,
find the patrol.
Maybe they'll give up by then
or run out of gas.
Yeah, if we don't first.
Stanley...
Stanley, hold on!
Doesn't look like
he put up much of a fight.
He was probably out
before he knew what hit him.
He must have trusted whoever did it.
The thing is, whoever it was,
they knew what
they were doing there,
not over here.
I mean, look at this.
It's a mess.
But the drives...
They look like they're still intact.
The old man had information
on the entire team...
Contact information,
backgrounds...
Last known whereabouts.
Let's find out where everybody is.
We can't outrun them.
- How far till Jericho?
- Too far.
Oh, God!
Stay down.
Stay down.
Give me that drive you got there.
Must feel good to be back
in the saddle, huh?
I wish we didn't have
to come out here in the first place.
What, are you getting soft on me?
Too much domestic bliss?
Not quite bliss.
There.
There it is. We're in.
Thank you.
Karaoke bullfighter, right?
Excuse me?
At that bar in Barcelona.
You decked a bullfighter who tried
to get you to stop singing that song...
"Stairway to Heaven"?
Did Roger tell you that?
He also mentioned you like Oreo,
ice cream and white daisies.
Don't be mad at him.
He was trying to keep us entertained.
He kept talking and,
somehow, we kept moving.
Hey. How you doing?
I'm a little tired.
I'm going to head home
and get cleaned up.
Think I'll stay here for a
little longer if you don't mind.
Yeah. Of course.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Looks like you owe
these folks a rematch.
So, um...
I will see you when I see you.
- To Jake.
- To Jake.
Who would have thought,
six months ago, you'd be toasting him?
Well, God knows Eric wouldn't
have hidden the bottle.
You and Jake have always
had much more in common
than you wanted to admit.
You going hunting
all those weekends...
Why that kid got sit
in a deer stand for hours?
We wouldn't say a word
to each other. Just...
be in the woods together.
I was always afraid that Jake
would forget about that.
You know, that he'd grow up only
remembering the bad times. That we were
That he wouldn't remember
that we had been close.
That we were... buddies once.
He remembers...
deep down.
That's why you mean
so much to him.
Boy, that wind sounds awful.
I hope Stanley and Jake
are okay out there.
What happened?
Jake, Stanley's not moving.
- What?
- Stanley's not moving.
Oh, my God. Go hide.
- Go hide.
- No
- Go on.
- No, No. Stanley...
You'll be fine.
Go! Go hide!
Come on.
Help me with Stanley.
I can't move.
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.
That's half the team.
We're being hunted.
It's worse than that.
It's Woodworth and his wife.
They were in Richmond.
That's his daughter.
Anyone close to us
is in danger, too.
No loose ends.
Don't worry about your family.
We're not going to let
anything happen to them.
It's just us, Chavez
and Cheung left.
We'll get back out on the field,
stay in the weeds
until we can connect
with the chief.
Here. Look at this.
What is that?
If we are being hunted,
there... is the hunter.
Stanley, are you okay?
Can you get up?
Your leg?
I think I busted my ankle.
I'm okay.
I'm just stuck.
- Let me try to get this off.
- Stanley, don't.
We can't do this ourselves.
You might make it worse.
Maybe you could dig me out.
All right.
Help me get the shovels. They're in
the bed of the truck.
It's gone.
All right, get the jack.
The jack's back there.
They took everything.
How was your bath?
Lukewarm, then luke-cold,
then pretty much icy.
- Look. Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.
Times Square,
New Year's Eve, 2005.
Wasted.
That hangover was epic.
Do you remember the last thing I said to
you the night before you left Jericho ?
That I was selfish
and I didn't listen?
Something like that?
You have no idea how that ate
at me while you were gone.
- I just kept thinking that was
the last  - You were right.
You know, today,
seeing you with those people...
It was like you had found yourself.
I'm still just trying to figure
it out, you know?
We're not these people anymore.
But I'll tell you the one thing
that hasn't changed.
The one constant.
I love you.
And it's going
to take a whole lot more
than the end of the world
to change that.
- How are your legs?
- I don't know I can't feel anything.
The ground's
frozen solid.
It's sucking the heat
right out of you.
Why can't we build a fire?
You smell the fumes?
You have to get back to town.
All right. I'm going
to try and go.
No. You can't on that ankle.
- I'll go.
- No. Those guys are still out there.
They went the other way.
Jericho has a patrol
five miles out of town.
We can't have come
more than ten.
Jake, it's too dangerous.
What are our options?
With no bags, no fire?
All right, one of you goes
or we all die here.
All right, fine, fine.
I threw a flashlight over there
somewhere. You might need it.
Listen...
stay on the shoulder
the whole time, okay?
If you see any headlights
or you hear any engines,
get low and hide,
all right?
Now, you're gonna
want to head
southeast.
Stanley, that doesn't mean
anything to me.
Stay on this road.
Stay on this road
and then you make...
make your first left
Okay?
And you're gonna go about a mile
and then you're gonna make
your second right,
and you're gonna make another right
and then another left.
And then once you get to the crossroads
of the highway, you're home free...
You'll see a big sign pointing
to the way to Jericho, okay?
Got it?
Left, second right.
Right, left,
Right.
Mimi, I...
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.
<i>Here's what we're gonna do:</i>
I know a place that's safe.
We take Darcy and the kids
out of Jericho
and stash them before you and I
get back on the move.
I am not leaving them alone.
- I don't think you have a choice.
- No...
See, because I've got leverage.
If they kill me, they will
never find the package.
It's not you
they're gonna kill.
It'll be Sam
or Darcy or me;
anything they can use
to get to you.
Anything they can
use to get to me.
The body.
These... These, uh...
...these half-smashed drives,
<i>...this whole...</i>
this whole setup--
If someone had wanted
to destroy all this,
why leave the house
standing, huh?
Why not just burn it all down?
Someone wanted us
to see all this.
We're being played.
Why would anyone go through
all that trouble?
I don't know,
but this is all too big now.
There's too many angles
to cover.
Too many unknowns.
I need to get home.
- Robert, wait.
- What?
Let's think about this.
What's the plan?
What are you going to do?
You know, maybe the plan all
along was to get us out here.
I gotta protect
my family, Sarah.
And what about the package?
It'll need to be moved.
This isn't so bad, right?
Hey, we've been
through worse.
Remember the time we got stuck on
the roof of the...
town hall in the middle
of a lightning storm, huh?
We were so afraid the lightning
was going to...
blow up the fireworks.
You squealed like a little girl
wanting to jump off that roof.
That was you.
Your voice hadn't changed yet.
Please, I had you beat by,
like, six months.
Drink some water.
It's frozen right through.
What?
I saw an abandoned cabin about
a quarter mile up the road.
You need to get inside.
It'll hurt, but you can make it.
- Jake, I'm staying.
- Listen to me!
There's no point in both of us
freezing to death out there.
- She's coming back.
- When?
She's been gone for, like,
an hour.
It'll take her a little while to
reach the patrol,
but when she does,
she'll find someone.
I know she'll find someone.
Unless somebody finds her first.
Look,
it's gonna get dark soon,
you need to go.
You wouldn't leave me
any more than I'm leaving you.
Mimi's strong.
She'll find her way.
Wait...
he said keep going east.
No... southeast.
And... look for a sign.
Oh, God, I hate this place!
Come on, man.
You can't fall asleep.
You got to stay up;
come on.
You stopped shivering.
Come on.
You got to talk to me--
come on, come on, buddy.
You gotta talk to me.
Talk to me, buddy.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
About what?
Five years ago.
Sorry I left the way I did.
Iit's okay. It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
I was gonna call.
I was gonna call.
I know. Listen, I want you
to forget about it, okay?
We never got to go backpacking
in Costa Rica.
You know what?
We're still gonna get to go
backpacking in Costa Rica, okay?
We're gonna...
we're gonna learn how to surf.
We're gonna sleep
on the beach.
As soon as the planes
are up and running again,
it's gonna be you and me.
Hell, you can fly us
there yourself, huh?
Come on. Come on.
Tell me something good, man.
I haven't talked to you in five years.
You've been gone for five years.
Tell me... Hey, tell me
about San Diego.
How was it?
- Warm.
- Warm, right.
Beaches, blondes, huh?
What were you doing there?
Flying, flying planes.
Really?
That's cool, man.
Your grandfather
would've been psyched, huh?
Did you have a girl there?
I know you had a girl.
She's dead.
What do you mean?
You don't know that.
I mean, it all depends on where she was
when the bombs went off, right?
I mean, she could
have made it, right?
- Tell me what her name was.
- She's dead....
It was my fault.
- It's not your fault.
- Let me lay down.
- Jake, no.
- Let me lay down.
It wasn't your fault.
Come on... Come on...
Come on, stay with me.
You gotta stay with me.
Come on, Jake.
Stay with me, Jake.
Come on, man.
Stay with me.
Come on!
Okay, gotta keep moving.
Gotta keep moving.
Please don't hurt me...
please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me!
Please don't hurt me...
Mimi?
- It's Gail and Johnston Green, honey.
You're safe.  - Oh, thanks God!
Come on, baby,
let's get out of here.
Come on.
Those are hideous.
Are those the sheets
from your old apartment?
Because you can't expect
anyone to sleep on those.
If anyone asks, we'll pretend
someone else donated them.
Your dress.
Guess I shouldn't be seeing this, huh?
The day's sort of come and gone, so...
It'll come again.
You think?
I do.
I tell you what, I've got
a pack of Ramen noodles
with your name on it,
what do you say?
Great. I'll deliver this to the shelter
and come back and wash up.
Roger, wait.
I'll come with you.
It's Mom and Dad, honey!
Stanley, you all right, sweetheart?
You need to go get in the truck
and get warm, pal.
- Where's Mimi?
- I'm right here.
Stanley, I'm right here.
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up, Jake.
Wake up.
Wake up. Oh, thank God.
We're gonna help you, honey.
We saw the storm coming
and we started to worry
when you hadn't come back.
Sweetheart...
Honey,
we're not gonna be able
to get this truck off of him.
I need you to take
these guys back to town
and get me some help out here.
You signal when you're coming back
so I know it's you, all right?
- I'll flash the lights.
- All right, go, go, go!
Jake, look at me, son.
Lookie here.
You're gonna make it, son...
I know you.
I know what you're made of.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna make it.
Stay with me now.
Robert, please,
the kids are sleeping.
- I'm sorry.
- What on earth are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jake, you'll be home real soon,
but you got to stay
with me now. Come on.
Leave me here.
Leave me alone.
Now, I'm not going anywhere.
But you got to hang on.
Now, they'll be here soon, son.
Dad...
I'm sorry.
Oh, son, you got nothing
to be sorry about.
Open your eyes, Jake.
Come on, now.
Look at me.
Look at me, Jake.
I can see her.
See who?
The girl.
What... girl?
Jake, I think you're hallucinating, son.
No, listen to me.
When I was in Iraq...
... there was a girl.
She couldn't have been more than...
10 or 12...
Don't talk now, son.
You save your energy.
We'll talk when we get... home.
I killed her, Dad.
I killed a little girl.
Hurry up!
Open your eyes, Jake.
Open your eyes.
All right, everyone on three...
One,
two, three!
All right, he's free.
Let's get the board in here.
One, two, three.
You were right.
I need to get my family
as far away from me as possible.
I've been thinking, and...
There's no other choice.
You're doing the right thing.
Listen.
After they're safe,
you and me need
to get back in the field.
That's half our team gone, Sarah,
and whoever did that
did it for a reason.
How are you gonna tell Darcy?
I'll tell her after I've moved them.
She'll never agree if she knows
I won't be staying with them.
He's better off here
than the med center.
We're still on emergency power,
and it's... it's warmer here.
Here, honey.
What about his injuries?
Well, the cut on his head
isn't very deep,
and neither one
of his legs are broken.
He's very lucky.
I'm freezing.
I'm gonna go get you
some more blankets.
You're still hypothermic.
It's just gonna take a few hours
for your body to stabilize.
- Can we have a minute?
- Oh, sure.
Dad...
What I told you out there...
please forget it.
Please.
Afraid I can't do that.
I've seen a lot of things
in my time, Jake.
I've been to war.
I know what war can do.
I know what men can do... Terrible...
... terrible things.
I know what I did.
You can talk to me.
When you're ready, son.
When you're ready.
You okay?
How's the sprain?
I think it'd be better with painkillers,
but I'm not gonna complain.
You know, for a while there, I didn't
think I'd ever feel anything again.
When I was out there,
just for a moment,
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.
And I stopped... to rest.
And then I just didn't
even want to move.
But you did.
You did make it.
And I knew you would.
Your lips are still cold.
Maybe you can warm them.
That's the worst line
I've ever heard.
I know. I've got others.
- Shut up.
- Okay.
Tomorrow morning...
we're leaving.
We're leaving?
For... for where?
I don't know yet.
You don't know?
Darcy, when I came
to get you in DC...
I told you it wasn't safe,
but I couldn't tell you why.
I'm going for a walk.
I have something
in my possession.
And there's people
out there that want it,
that will stop at nothing to get it.
And that puts you,
me and the kids
in danger here.
Okay, so th... then we go.
<i>I trust you.</i>
<i>Robert, do y...</i>
Do you trust me?
- You're late.
- You're impatient.
Then listen to me.
Okay, Sarah is not on our side.
Now... whatever's...
gone on between the two of you,
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.
Have you located the package?
Soon.
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
We've already eliminated the other
three targets without incident.
Why are you stalling on this one?
Because this one is different.

Previously on Jericho
<i>Bring them inside.</i>
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>
<i>that landed in
the middle of nowhere.</i>
<i>They've been walking
for weeks.</i>
<i>They must have gone
through hell.</i>
<i>Oh, my God... Roger.</i>
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>
<i>You need to keep
them clean and warm.</i>
<i>Do you know anyone
in Jericho?</i>
<i>Actually... I do.</i>
<i>Hello, Rob.</i>
<i>We're using the generator
to power the town hall</i>
<i>for three hours a day,
the Med Center for six.</i>
<i>With 53 new people, at current
levels of consumption...</i>
<i>we will be completely out
of gas and diesel in two weeks.</i>
<i>- Mrs. Green?
- What?</i>
<i>Eric told me that
April's pregnant.</i>
<i>It's the Old Man.</i>
<i>He's coming for us
using us against each other.</i>
<i>We go see him and if,
if he is behind this,</i>
<i>We take him out.</i>
<i>We leave first thing
in the morning.</i>
<i>Any luck out there?</i>
Sorry, ma'am.
Nothing?
Not even rabbits?
Never seen anything
like it before.
Nothing moving out there.
Think it was the fallout? Maybe it was
the radiation that killed the deer.
There'd still be dead animals,
carcasses, something.
I mean, it was weird.
Like all the game had vanished.
How far out
did you go?
15 miles out by Mill Pond
along the creek there.
Guess we're going to have
to drive, huh, Jake?
Yeah, but we have to be careful
about burning the gas rations
in the middle of winter.
We need everything we can
to run the generator.
We can live without
power for now.
Make fires to stay warm.
But we won't see Spring
if we don't eat.
Stanley and I will have to use
whatever gas we can spare.
and go out west,
Go out as far as it takes.
The rest of the hunting parties
will have to scrounge around locally.
Yeah, and Mimi's coming
with us.
What?
Well, in case something happens to me,
I want to make sure she knows...
how to trap and shoot, okay?
Look, the further you get
the hairier the roads are.
With food being
as scarce as it is,
there's bound to be
some trouble out there.
That sleeping bag's
rated to 40 below
and here's a wind-proof lighter for you.
You're going to need them both.
Good hunting.
I'm guessing the good folks
of Jericho don't know
about all this stuff down here.
- They don't know about a lot of things.
That'll be enough to get us
to the Old Man's place?
He is only about
two hours away.
I didn't realize
he was so close.
He chose the rally point.
Wanted it in his backyard.
How long as he been
watching you?
My guess...
since I stopped communications
a few days ago.
You worried about what we're
going to find out there?
- You're not.
- We can handle him.
It's you and me.
Let's get to work.
My grandmother
went fast than this
and she didn't
even have a car.
We have to take it easy,
we only have half a tank.
Well, hopefully we'll make it
to Flint Springs. It's got...
Hopefully? What do you
mean "hopefully"?
It's got a river.
It's prime white-tailed terrain.
I know, but...
This is crazy.
I told you that
I can't hunt.
Now you want me to kill Bambi.
You're gonna have to
learn, all right?
Everyone's doing their part.
Bonnie's been out twice.
Well, good for
frickin' Bonnie.
Bonnie grew up on farm.
The closest I ever got
to the outdoors
was the is the Ralph Lauren
section of Neiman Marcus.
There you go,
bargain hunting.
Same thing, but with a gun.
Bargains? At Neimans?
Sometimes I forget
that the biggest designer
in your closet is Wrangler.
What are you
laughing at?
I've never seen you in a
domestic squabble before.
Knock it off.
This isn't squabbling.
Oh, my God.
These dogs have tags.
Look at all this.
Wall Drugs.
Wall, South Dakota.
Do you think that's where all
these people were coming from?
Think about it.
South Dakota without heat,
electricity, or...
food being trucked in.
It's got to be even worse
in North Dakota,
Montana.
Oh, my God.
I read about this
at Blackjack.
Mass migration, hundreds...
maybe thousands of people
heading south.
Trying to outrun winter.
Should we be doing
that, too?

How far is it?
...60.
It's about 60 yards.
So 60 yard with almost
1.5 people per yard.
That's 90.
That's almost 100 people
just across.
The way the ground
is trampled,
you got to figure five
or tens times that amount
of people came through here.
Almost a thousand people?
Where are they going?
South Texas, Mexico.
Anyplace warmer.
It'd take weeks
to get there by foot.
God know how many thousand
people have the same idea.
Mexico's borders
could be closed.
We don't even know if
there still is a Mexico.
Maybe we should try
to catch on with them.
We can barely feed ourselves,
let alone... hundreds more.
We got to keep going.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Hey. Glad you came down.
Thank you.
- What time did you, uh...
- Early...
late, I guess.
I didn't want to wake you,
you looked so peaceful.
Peaceful? Really?
Did you have another one of those
bad dreams? Keep on there.
I guess neither one of
us got much sleep.
All I could do was think about
all these people down here, you know.
And then I remembered about the
clothes we had in the attic.
I thought that sweater
looked familiar.
Yeah, that woman was on
layover in Kansas City
when the bombs went off,
Her husband and two kids
were waiting for her at home.
Where?
Denver.
I lead these people here.
For better or worse
this is their home now.
It's on me to make sure
they're taken care of.
Yeah, of course.
What can I do to help, huh?
Talk to them,
follow your instincts.
The truth is...
I'm winging this myself.
I'll be outside.
Here.
Should be back
before dark.
And if you're not?
Just tell me when I
should start to worry.
This is the last time,
okay?
After today
I'm here...
for good, huh?
Okay.
I'll hold you to that.
Hi, honey.
How'd it go this morning?
The whole thing
was a bust.
I'm sorry, hon.
Jake's out there now.
Hopefully he and Stanley
will have better luck
than I did.
Is April here?
No, she's at
the clinic.
She promised me
she'd take a nap.
I hope it is warmer in that
clinic than it is in this house.
I think this house has
dropped ten degrees
in the last hour.
Feels like a storm's
coming in.
We'd better seal up these
windows the best was we can.
Been going around collecting
old sheets and linens.
We'll shove them
underneath the doors.
Look what I found...
hidden in Jake's closet.
Lord knows how long
that's been there.
Well, at least he was
drinking the good stuff.
I used to hide the most awful
rotgut in the world
behind my mother's
china cabinet.
What do you think?
On an empty stomach?
I'll get the glasses.
Why would anyone destroy all this.
If they'd wanted it out of commission,
they could have just taken it.
Be worth a fortune after the E.M.P.
Maybe there wasn't time,
or maybe they didn't
care about this stuff.
- How long?
- A couple of days...
Give or take.
But we just heard
from him yesterday.
We heard from someone.
Remote uplink.
Somebody else using
his access codes.
Who could have done this?
Wager for the first kill.
I'm in for a dozen eggs.
Two hours chopping wood.
Tax return consultation.
Oh, how about
foot massages for a week?
For me, not for him.
We'll talk.
Stanley, stop.
- What are they doing?
- They're blocking the whole road.
More like staking it out.
All right, turn around.
And... and go where?
I don't know. Just do it, all right?
Turn around. We'll find another road.
I see it. Damn it.
Why are they following us?
Stanley, gun it!
This should get us
back to the highway.
Then what?
We try to make it back home,
find the patrol.
Maybe they'll give up by then
or run out of gas.
Yeah, if we don't first.
Stanley...
Stanley, hold on!
Doesn't look like
he put up much of a fight.
He was probably out
before he knew what hit him.
He must have trusted whoever did it.
The thing is, whoever it was,
they knew what
they were doing there,
not over here.
I mean, look at this.
It's a mess.
But the drives...
They look like they're still intact.
The old man had information
on the entire team...
Contact information,
backgrounds...
Last known whereabouts.
Let's find out where everybody is.
We can't outrun them.
- How far till Jericho?
- Too far.
Oh, God!
Stay down.
Stay down.
Give me that drive you got there.
Must feel good to be back
in the saddle, huh?
I wish we didn't have
to come out here in the first place.
What, are you getting soft on me?
Too much domestic bliss?
Not quite bliss.
There.
There it is. We're in.
Thank you.
Karaoke bullfighter, right?
Excuse me?
At that bar in Barcelona.
You decked a bullfighter who tried
to get you to stop singing that song...
"Stairway to Heaven"?
Did Roger tell you that?
He also mentioned you like Oreo,
ice cream and white daisies.
Don't be mad at him.
He was trying to keep us entertained.
He kept talking and,
somehow, we kept moving.
Hey. How you doing?
I'm a little tired.
I'm going to head home
and get cleaned up.
Think I'll stay here for a
little longer if you don't mind.
Yeah. Of course.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Looks like you owe
these folks a rematch.
So, um...
I will see you when I see you.
- To Jake.
- To Jake.
Who would have thought,
six months ago, you'd be toasting him?
Well, God knows Eric wouldn't
have hidden the bottle.
You and Jake have always
had much more in common
than you wanted to admit.
You going hunting
all those weekends...
Why that kid got sit
in a deer stand for hours?
We wouldn't say a word
to each other. Just...
be in the woods together.
I was always afraid that Jake
would forget about that.
You know, that he'd grow up only
remembering the bad times. That we were
That he wouldn't remember
that we had been close.
That we were... buddies once.
He remembers...
deep down.
That's why you mean
so much to him.
Boy, that wind sounds awful.
I hope Stanley and Jake
are okay out there.
What happened?
Jake, Stanley's not moving.
- What?
- Stanley's not moving.
Oh, my God. Go hide.
- Go hide.
- No
- Go on.
- No, No. Stanley...
You'll be fine.
Go! Go hide!
Come on.
Help me with Stanley.
I can't move.
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.
That's half the team.
We're being hunted.
It's worse than that.
It's Woodworth and his wife.
They were in Richmond.
That's his daughter.
Anyone close to us
is in danger, too.
No loose ends.
Don't worry about your family.
We're not going to let
anything happen to them.
It's just us, Chavez
and Cheung left.
We'll get back out on the field,
stay in the weeds
until we can connect
with the chief.
Here. Look at this.
What is that?
If we are being hunted,
there... is the hunter.
Stanley, are you okay?
Can you get up?
Your leg?
I think I busted my ankle.
I'm okay.
I'm just stuck.
- Let me try to get this off.
- Stanley, don't.
We can't do this ourselves.
You might make it worse.
Maybe you could dig me out.
All right.
Help me get the shovels. They're in
the bed of the truck.
It's gone.
All right, get the jack.
The jack's back there.
They took everything.
How was your bath?
Lukewarm, then luke-cold,
then pretty much icy.
- Look. Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.
Times Square,
New Year's Eve, 2005.
Wasted.
That hangover was epic.
Do you remember the last thing I said to
you the night before you left Jericho ?
That I was selfish
and I didn't listen?
Something like that?
You have no idea how that ate
at me while you were gone.
- I just kept thinking that was
the last  - You were right.
You know, today,
seeing you with those people...
It was like you had found yourself.
I'm still just trying to figure
it out, you know?
We're not these people anymore.
But I'll tell you the one thing
that hasn't changed.
The one constant.
I love you.
And it's going
to take a whole lot more
than the end of the world
to change that.
- How are your legs?
- I don't know I can't feel anything.
The ground's
frozen solid.
It's sucking the heat
right out of you.
Why can't we build a fire?
You smell the fumes?
You have to get back to town.
All right. I'm going
to try and go.
No. You can't on that ankle.
- I'll go.
- No. Those guys are still out there.
They went the other way.
Jericho has a patrol
five miles out of town.
We can't have come
more than ten.
Jake, it's too dangerous.
What are our options?
With no bags, no fire?
All right, one of you goes
or we all die here.
All right, fine, fine.
I threw a flashlight over there
somewhere. You might need it.
Listen...
stay on the shoulder
the whole time, okay?
If you see any headlights
or you hear any engines,
get low and hide,
all right?
Now, you're gonna
want to head
southeast.
Stanley, that doesn't mean
anything to me.
Stay on this road.
Stay on this road
and then you make...
make your first left
Okay?
And you're gonna go about a mile
and then you're gonna make
your second right,
and you're gonna make another right
and then another left.
And then once you get to the crossroads
of the highway, you're home free...
You'll see a big sign pointing
to the way to Jericho, okay?
Got it?
Left, second right.
Right, left,
Right.
Mimi, I...
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.
<i>Here's what we're gonna do:</i>
I know a place that's safe.
We take Darcy and the kids
out of Jericho
and stash them before you and I
get back on the move.
I am not leaving them alone.
- I don't think you have a choice.
- No...
See, because I've got leverage.
If they kill me, they will
never find the package.
It's not you
they're gonna kill.
It'll be Sam
or Darcy or me;
anything they can use
to get to you.
Anything they can
use to get to me.
The body.
These... These, uh...
...these half-smashed drives,
<i>...this whole...</i>
this whole setup--
If someone had wanted
to destroy all this,
why leave the house
standing, huh?
Why not just burn it all down?
Someone wanted us
to see all this.
We're being played.
Why would anyone go through
all that trouble?
I don't know,
but this is all too big now.
There's too many angles
to cover.
Too many unknowns.
I need to get home.
- Robert, wait.
- What?
Let's think about this.
What's the plan?
What are you going to do?
You know, maybe the plan all
along was to get us out here.
I gotta protect
my family, Sarah.
And what about the package?
It'll need to be moved.
This isn't so bad, right?
Hey, we've been
through worse.
Remember the time we got stuck on
the roof of the...
town hall in the middle
of a lightning storm, huh?
We were so afraid the lightning
was going to...
blow up the fireworks.
You squealed like a little girl
wanting to jump off that roof.
That was you.
Your voice hadn't changed yet.
Please, I had you beat by,
like, six months.
Drink some water.
It's frozen right through.
What?
I saw an abandoned cabin about
a quarter mile up the road.
You need to get inside.
It'll hurt, but you can make it.
- Jake, I'm staying.
- Listen to me!
There's no point in both of us
freezing to death out there.
- She's coming back.
- When?
She's been gone for, like,
an hour.
It'll take her a little while to
reach the patrol,
but when she does,
she'll find someone.
I know she'll find someone.
Unless somebody finds her first.
Look,
it's gonna get dark soon,
you need to go.
You wouldn't leave me
any more than I'm leaving you.
Mimi's strong.
She'll find her way.
Wait...
he said keep going east.
No... southeast.
And... look for a sign.
Oh, God, I hate this place!
Come on, man.
You can't fall asleep.
You got to stay up;
come on.
You stopped shivering.
Come on.
You got to talk to me--
come on, come on, buddy.
You gotta talk to me.
Talk to me, buddy.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
About what?
Five years ago.
Sorry I left the way I did.
Iit's okay. It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
I was gonna call.
I was gonna call.
I know. Listen, I want you
to forget about it, okay?
We never got to go backpacking
in Costa Rica.
You know what?
We're still gonna get to go
backpacking in Costa Rica, okay?
We're gonna...
we're gonna learn how to surf.
We're gonna sleep
on the beach.
As soon as the planes
are up and running again,
it's gonna be you and me.
Hell, you can fly us
there yourself, huh?
Come on. Come on.
Tell me something good, man.
I haven't talked to you in five years.
You've been gone for five years.
Tell me... Hey, tell me
about San Diego.
How was it?
- Warm.
- Warm, right.
Beaches, blondes, huh?
What were you doing there?
Flying, flying planes.
Really?
That's cool, man.
Your grandfather
would've been psyched, huh?
Did you have a girl there?
I know you had a girl.
She's dead.
What do you mean?
You don't know that.
I mean, it all depends on where she was
when the bombs went off, right?
I mean, she could
have made it, right?
- Tell me what her name was.
- She's dead....
It was my fault.
- It's not your fault.
- Let me lay down.
- Jake, no.
- Let me lay down.
It wasn't your fault.
Come on... Come on...
Come on, stay with me.
You gotta stay with me.
Come on, Jake.
Stay with me, Jake.
Come on, man.
Stay with me.
Come on!
Okay, gotta keep moving.
Gotta keep moving.
Please don't hurt me...
please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me!
Please don't hurt me...
Mimi?
- It's Gail and Johnston Green, honey.
You're safe.  - Oh, thanks God!
Come on, baby,
let's get out of here.
Come on.
Those are hideous.
Are those the sheets
from your old apartment?
Because you can't expect
anyone to sleep on those.
If anyone asks, we'll pretend
someone else donated them.
Your dress.
Guess I shouldn't be seeing this, huh?
The day's sort of come and gone, so...
It'll come again.
You think?
I do.
I tell you what, I've got
a pack of Ramen noodles
with your name on it,
what do you say?
Great. I'll deliver this to the shelter
and come back and wash up.
Roger, wait.
I'll come with you.
It's Mom and Dad, honey!
Stanley, you all right, sweetheart?
You need to go get in the truck
and get warm, pal.
- Where's Mimi?
- I'm right here.
Stanley, I'm right here.
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up, Jake.
Wake up.
Wake up. Oh, thank God.
We're gonna help you, honey.
We saw the storm coming
and we started to worry
when you hadn't come back.
Sweetheart...
Honey,
we're not gonna be able
to get this truck off of him.
I need you to take
these guys back to town
and get me some help out here.
You signal when you're coming back
so I know it's you, all right?
- I'll flash the lights.
- All right, go, go, go!
Jake, look at me, son.
Lookie here.
You're gonna make it, son...
I know you.
I know what you're made of.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna make it.
Stay with me now.
Robert, please,
the kids are sleeping.
- I'm sorry.
- What on earth are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jake, you'll be home real soon,
but you got to stay
with me now. Come on.
Leave me here.
Leave me alone.
Now, I'm not going anywhere.
But you got to hang on.
Now, they'll be here soon, son.
Dad...
I'm sorry.
Oh, son, you got nothing
to be sorry about.
Open your eyes, Jake.
Come on, now.
Look at me.
Look at me, Jake.
I can see her.
See who?
The girl.
What... girl?
Jake, I think you're hallucinating, son.
No, listen to me.
When I was in Iraq...
... there was a girl.
She couldn't have been more than...
10 or 12...
Don't talk now, son.
You save your energy.
We'll talk when we get... home.
I killed her, Dad.
I killed a little girl.
Hurry up!
Open your eyes, Jake.
Open your eyes.
All right, everyone on three...
One,
two, three!
All right, he's free.
Let's get the board in here.
One, two, three.
You were right.
I need to get my family
as far away from me as possible.
I've been thinking, and...
There's no other choice.
You're doing the right thing.
Listen.
After they're safe,
you and me need
to get back in the field.
That's half our team gone, Sarah,
and whoever did that
did it for a reason.
How are you gonna tell Darcy?
I'll tell her after I've moved them.
She'll never agree if she knows
I won't be staying with them.
He's better off here
than the med center.
We're still on emergency power,
and it's... it's warmer here.
Here, honey.
What about his injuries?
Well, the cut on his head
isn't very deep,
and neither one
of his legs are broken.
He's very lucky.
I'm freezing.
I'm gonna go get you
some more blankets.
You're still hypothermic.
It's just gonna take a few hours
for your body to stabilize.
- Can we have a minute?
- Oh, sure.
Dad...
What I told you out there...
please forget it.
Please.
Afraid I can't do that.
I've seen a lot of things
in my time, Jake.
I've been to war.
I know what war can do.
I know what men can do... Terrible...
... terrible things.
I know what I did.
You can talk to me.
When you're ready, son.
When you're ready.
You okay?
How's the sprain?
I think it'd be better with painkillers,
but I'm not gonna complain.
You know, for a while there, I didn't
think I'd ever feel anything again.
When I was out there,
just for a moment,
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.
And I stopped... to rest.
And then I just didn't
even want to move.
But you did.
You did make it.
And I knew you would.
Your lips are still cold.
Maybe you can warm them.
That's the worst line
I've ever heard.
I know. I've got others.
- Shut up.
- Okay.
Tomorrow morning...
we're leaving.
We're leaving?
For... for where?
I don't know yet.
You don't know?
Darcy, when I came
to get you in DC...
I told you it wasn't safe,
but I couldn't tell you why.
I'm going for a walk.
I have something
in my possession.
And there's people
out there that want it,
that will stop at nothing to get it.
And that puts you,
me and the kids
in danger here.
Okay, so th... then we go.
<i>I trust you.</i>
<i>Robert, do y...</i>
Do you trust me?
- You're late.
- You're impatient.
Then listen to me.
Okay, Sarah is not on our side.
Now... whatever's...
gone on between the two of you,
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.
Have you located the package?
Soon.
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
We've already eliminated the other
three targets without incident.
Why are you stalling on this one?
Because this one is different.

Previously on Jericho
<i>Bring them inside.</i>
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>
<i>that landed in
the middle of nowhere.</i>
<i>They've been walking
for weeks.</i>
<i>They must have gone
through hell.</i>
<i>Oh, my God... Roger.</i>
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>
<i>You need to keep
them clean and warm.</i>
<i>Do you know anyone
in Jericho?</i>
<i>Actually... I do.</i>
<i>Hello, Rob.</i>
<i>We're using the generator
to power the town hall</i>
<i>for three hours a day,
the Med Center for six.</i>
<i>With 53 new people, at current
levels of consumption...</i>
<i>we will be completely out
of gas and diesel in two weeks.</i>
<i>- Mrs. Green?
- What?</i>
<i>Eric told me that
April's pregnant.</i>
<i>It's the Old Man.</i>
<i>He's coming for us
using us against each other.</i>
<i>We go see him and if,
if he is behind this,</i>
<i>We take him out.</i>
<i>We leave first thing
in the morning.</i>
<i>Any luck out there?</i>
Sorry, ma'am.
Nothing?
Not even rabbits?
Never seen anything
like it before.
Nothing moving out there.
Think it was the fallout? Maybe it was
the radiation that killed the deer.
There'd still be dead animals,
carcasses, something.
I mean, it was weird.
Like all the game had vanished.
How far out
did you go?
15 miles out by Mill Pond
along the creek there.
Guess we're going to have
to drive, huh, Jake?
Yeah, but we have to be careful
about burning the gas rations
in the middle of winter.
We need everything we can
to run the generator.
We can live without
power for now.
Make fires to stay warm.
But we won't see Spring
if we don't eat.
Stanley and I will have to use
whatever gas we can spare.
and go out west,
Go out as far as it takes.
The rest of the hunting parties
will have to scrounge around locally.
Yeah, and Mimi's coming
with us.
What?
Well, in case something happens to me,
I want to make sure she knows...
how to trap and shoot, okay?
Look, the further you get
the hairier the roads are.
With food being
as scarce as it is,
there's bound to be
some trouble out there.
That sleeping bag's
rated to 40 below
and here's a wind-proof lighter for you.
You're going to need them both.
Good hunting.
I'm guessing the good folks
of Jericho don't know
about all this stuff down here.
- They don't know about a lot of things.
That'll be enough to get us
to the Old Man's place?
He is only about
two hours away.
I didn't realize
he was so close.
He chose the rally point.
Wanted it in his backyard.
How long as he been
watching you?
My guess...
since I stopped communications
a few days ago.
You worried about what we're
going to find out there?
- You're not.
- We can handle him.
It's you and me.
Let's get to work.
My grandmother
went fast than this
and she didn't
even have a car.
We have to take it easy,
we only have half a tank.
Well, hopefully we'll make it
to Flint Springs. It's got...
Hopefully? What do you
mean "hopefully"?
It's got a river.
It's prime white-tailed terrain.
I know, but...
This is crazy.
I told you that
I can't hunt.
Now you want me to kill Bambi.
You're gonna have to
learn, all right?
Everyone's doing their part.
Bonnie's been out twice.
Well, good for
frickin' Bonnie.
Bonnie grew up on farm.
The closest I ever got
to the outdoors
was the is the Ralph Lauren
section of Neiman Marcus.
There you go,
bargain hunting.
Same thing, but with a gun.
Bargains? At Neimans?
Sometimes I forget
that the biggest designer
in your closet is Wrangler.
What are you
laughing at?
I've never seen you in a
domestic squabble before.
Knock it off.
This isn't squabbling.
Oh, my God.
These dogs have tags.
Look at all this.
Wall Drugs.
Wall, South Dakota.
Do you think that's where all
these people were coming from?
Think about it.
South Dakota without heat,
electricity, or...
food being trucked in.
It's got to be even worse
in North Dakota,
Montana.
Oh, my God.
I read about this
at Blackjack.
Mass migration, hundreds...
maybe thousands of people
heading south.
Trying to outrun winter.
Should we be doing
that, too?

How far is it?
...60.
It's about 60 yards.
So 60 yard with almost
1.5 people per yard.
That's 90.
That's almost 100 people
just across.
The way the ground
is trampled,
you got to figure five
or tens times that amount
of people came through here.
Almost a thousand people?
Where are they going?
South Texas, Mexico.
Anyplace warmer.
It'd take weeks
to get there by foot.
God know how many thousand
people have the same idea.
Mexico's borders
could be closed.
We don't even know if
there still is a Mexico.
Maybe we should try
to catch on with them.
We can barely feed ourselves,
let alone... hundreds more.
We got to keep going.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Hey. Glad you came down.
Thank you.
- What time did you, uh...
- Early...
late, I guess.
I didn't want to wake you,
you looked so peaceful.
Peaceful? Really?
Did you have another one of those
bad dreams? Keep on there.
I guess neither one of
us got much sleep.
All I could do was think about
all these people down here, you know.
And then I remembered about the
clothes we had in the attic.
I thought that sweater
looked familiar.
Yeah, that woman was on
layover in Kansas City
when the bombs went off,
Her husband and two kids
were waiting for her at home.
Where?
Denver.
I lead these people here.
For better or worse
this is their home now.
It's on me to make sure
they're taken care of.
Yeah, of course.
What can I do to help, huh?
Talk to them,
follow your instincts.
The truth is...
I'm winging this myself.
I'll be outside.
Here.
Should be back
before dark.
And if you're not?
Just tell me when I
should start to worry.
This is the last time,
okay?
After today
I'm here...
for good, huh?
Okay.
I'll hold you to that.
Hi, honey.
How'd it go this morning?
The whole thing
was a bust.
I'm sorry, hon.
Jake's out there now.
Hopefully he and Stanley
will have better luck
than I did.
Is April here?
No, she's at
the clinic.
She promised me
she'd take a nap.
I hope it is warmer in that
clinic than it is in this house.
I think this house has
dropped ten degrees
in the last hour.
Feels like a storm's
coming in.
We'd better seal up these
windows the best was we can.
Been going around collecting
old sheets and linens.
We'll shove them
underneath the doors.
Look what I found...
hidden in Jake's closet.
Lord knows how long
that's been there.
Well, at least he was
drinking the good stuff.
I used to hide the most awful
rotgut in the world
behind my mother's
china cabinet.
What do you think?
On an empty stomach?
I'll get the glasses.
Why would anyone destroy all this.
If they'd wanted it out of commission,
they could have just taken it.
Be worth a fortune after the E.M.P.
Maybe there wasn't time,
or maybe they didn't
care about this stuff.
- How long?
- A couple of days...
Give or take.
But we just heard
from him yesterday.
We heard from someone.
Remote uplink.
Somebody else using
his access codes.
Who could have done this?
Wager for the first kill.
I'm in for a dozen eggs.
Two hours chopping wood.
Tax return consultation.
Oh, how about
foot massages for a week?
For me, not for him.
We'll talk.
Stanley, stop.
- What are they doing?
- They're blocking the whole road.
More like staking it out.
All right, turn around.
And... and go where?
I don't know. Just do it, all right?
Turn around. We'll find another road.
I see it. Damn it.
Why are they following us?
Stanley, gun it!
This should get us
back to the highway.
Then what?
We try to make it back home,
find the patrol.
Maybe they'll give up by then
or run out of gas.
Yeah, if we don't first.
Stanley...
Stanley, hold on!
Doesn't look like
he put up much of a fight.
He was probably out
before he knew what hit him.
He must have trusted whoever did it.
The thing is, whoever it was,
they knew what
they were doing there,
not over here.
I mean, look at this.
It's a mess.
But the drives...
They look like they're still intact.
The old man had information
on the entire team...
Contact information,
backgrounds...
Last known whereabouts.
Let's find out where everybody is.
We can't outrun them.
- How far till Jericho?
- Too far.
Oh, God!
Stay down.
Stay down.
Give me that drive you got there.
Must feel good to be back
in the saddle, huh?
I wish we didn't have
to come out here in the first place.
What, are you getting soft on me?
Too much domestic bliss?
Not quite bliss.
There.
There it is. We're in.
Thank you.
Karaoke bullfighter, right?
Excuse me?
At that bar in Barcelona.
You decked a bullfighter who tried
to get you to stop singing that song...
"Stairway to Heaven"?
Did Roger tell you that?
He also mentioned you like Oreo,
ice cream and white daisies.
Don't be mad at him.
He was trying to keep us entertained.
He kept talking and,
somehow, we kept moving.
Hey. How you doing?
I'm a little tired.
I'm going to head home
and get cleaned up.
Think I'll stay here for a
little longer if you don't mind.
Yeah. Of course.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Looks like you owe
these folks a rematch.
So, um...
I will see you when I see you.
- To Jake.
- To Jake.
Who would have thought,
six months ago, you'd be toasting him?
Well, God knows Eric wouldn't
have hidden the bottle.
You and Jake have always
had much more in common
than you wanted to admit.
You going hunting
all those weekends...
Why that kid got sit
in a deer stand for hours?
We wouldn't say a word
to each other. Just...
be in the woods together.
I was always afraid that Jake
would forget about that.
You know, that he'd grow up only
remembering the bad times. That we were
That he wouldn't remember
that we had been close.
That we were... buddies once.
He remembers...
deep down.
That's why you mean
so much to him.
Boy, that wind sounds awful.
I hope Stanley and Jake
are okay out there.
What happened?
Jake, Stanley's not moving.
- What?
- Stanley's not moving.
Oh, my God. Go hide.
- Go hide.
- No
- Go on.
- No, No. Stanley...
You'll be fine.
Go! Go hide!
Come on.
Help me with Stanley.
I can't move.
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.
That's half the team.
We're being hunted.
It's worse than that.
It's Woodworth and his wife.
They were in Richmond.
That's his daughter.
Anyone close to us
is in danger, too.
No loose ends.
Don't worry about your family.
We're not going to let
anything happen to them.
It's just us, Chavez
and Cheung left.
We'll get back out on the field,
stay in the weeds
until we can connect
with the chief.
Here. Look at this.
What is that?
If we are being hunted,
there... is the hunter.
Stanley, are you okay?
Can you get up?
Your leg?
I think I busted my ankle.
I'm okay.
I'm just stuck.
- Let me try to get this off.
- Stanley, don't.
We can't do this ourselves.
You might make it worse.
Maybe you could dig me out.
All right.
Help me get the shovels. They're in
the bed of the truck.
It's gone.
All right, get the jack.
The jack's back there.
They took everything.
How was your bath?
Lukewarm, then luke-cold,
then pretty much icy.
- Look. Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.
Times Square,
New Year's Eve, 2005.
Wasted.
That hangover was epic.
Do you remember the last thing I said to
you the night before you left Jericho ?
That I was selfish
and I didn't listen?
Something like that?
You have no idea how that ate
at me while you were gone.
- I just kept thinking that was
the last  - You were right.
You know, today,
seeing you with those people...
It was like you had found yourself.
I'm still just trying to figure
it out, you know?
We're not these people anymore.
But I'll tell you the one thing
that hasn't changed.
The one constant.
I love you.
And it's going
to take a whole lot more
than the end of the world
to change that.
- How are your legs?
- I don't know I can't feel anything.
The ground's
frozen solid.
It's sucking the heat
right out of you.
Why can't we build a fire?
You smell the fumes?
You have to get back to town.
All right. I'm going
to try and go.
No. You can't on that ankle.
- I'll go.
- No. Those guys are still out there.
They went the other way.
Jericho has a patrol
five miles out of town.
We can't have come
more than ten.
Jake, it's too dangerous.
What are our options?
With no bags, no fire?
All right, one of you goes
or we all die here.
All right, fine, fine.
I threw a flashlight over there
somewhere. You might need it.
Listen...
stay on the shoulder
the whole time, okay?
If you see any headlights
or you hear any engines,
get low and hide,
all right?
Now, you're gonna
want to head
southeast.
Stanley, that doesn't mean
anything to me.
Stay on this road.
Stay on this road
and then you make...
make your first left
Okay?
And you're gonna go about a mile
and then you're gonna make
your second right,
and you're gonna make another right
and then another left.
And then once you get to the crossroads
of the highway, you're home free...
You'll see a big sign pointing
to the way to Jericho, okay?
Got it?
Left, second right.
Right, left,
Right.
Mimi, I...
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.
<i>Here's what we're gonna do:</i>
I know a place that's safe.
We take Darcy and the kids
out of Jericho
and stash them before you and I
get back on the move.
I am not leaving them alone.
- I don't think you have a choice.
- No...
See, because I've got leverage.
If they kill me, they will
never find the package.
It's not you
they're gonna kill.
It'll be Sam
or Darcy or me;
anything they can use
to get to you.
Anything they can
use to get to me.
The body.
These... These, uh...
...these half-smashed drives,
<i>...this whole...</i>
this whole setup--
If someone had wanted
to destroy all this,
why leave the house
standing, huh?
Why not just burn it all down?
Someone wanted us
to see all this.
We're being played.
Why would anyone go through
all that trouble?
I don't know,
but this is all too big now.
There's too many angles
to cover.
Too many unknowns.
I need to get home.
- Robert, wait.
- What?
Let's think about this.
What's the plan?
What are you going to do?
You know, maybe the plan all
along was to get us out here.
I gotta protect
my family, Sarah.
And what about the package?
It'll need to be moved.
This isn't so bad, right?
Hey, we've been
through worse.
Remember the time we got stuck on
the roof of the...
town hall in the middle
of a lightning storm, huh?
We were so afraid the lightning
was going to...
blow up the fireworks.
You squealed like a little girl
wanting to jump off that roof.
That was you.
Your voice hadn't changed yet.
Please, I had you beat by,
like, six months.
Drink some water.
It's frozen right through.
What?
I saw an abandoned cabin about
a quarter mile up the road.
You need to get inside.
It'll hurt, but you can make it.
- Jake, I'm staying.
- Listen to me!
There's no point in both of us
freezing to death out there.
- She's coming back.
- When?
She's been gone for, like,
an hour.
It'll take her a little while to
reach the patrol,
but when she does,
she'll find someone.
I know she'll find someone.
Unless somebody finds her first.
Look,
it's gonna get dark soon,
you need to go.
You wouldn't leave me
any more than I'm leaving you.
Mimi's strong.
She'll find her way.
Wait...
he said keep going east.
No... southeast.
And... look for a sign.
Oh, God, I hate this place!
Come on, man.
You can't fall asleep.
You got to stay up;
come on.
You stopped shivering.
Come on.
You got to talk to me--
come on, come on, buddy.
You gotta talk to me.
Talk to me, buddy.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
About what?
Five years ago.
Sorry I left the way I did.
Iit's okay. It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
I was gonna call.
I was gonna call.
I know. Listen, I want you
to forget about it, okay?
We never got to go backpacking
in Costa Rica.
You know what?
We're still gonna get to go
backpacking in Costa Rica, okay?
We're gonna...
we're gonna learn how to surf.
We're gonna sleep
on the beach.
As soon as the planes
are up and running again,
it's gonna be you and me.
Hell, you can fly us
there yourself, huh?
Come on. Come on.
Tell me something good, man.
I haven't talked to you in five years.
You've been gone for five years.
Tell me... Hey, tell me
about San Diego.
How was it?
- Warm.
- Warm, right.
Beaches, blondes, huh?
What were you doing there?
Flying, flying planes.
Really?
That's cool, man.
Your grandfather
would've been psyched, huh?
Did you have a girl there?
I know you had a girl.
She's dead.
What do you mean?
You don't know that.
I mean, it all depends on where she was
when the bombs went off, right?
I mean, she could
have made it, right?
- Tell me what her name was.
- She's dead....
It was my fault.
- It's not your fault.
- Let me lay down.
- Jake, no.
- Let me lay down.
It wasn't your fault.
Come on... Come on...
Come on, stay with me.
You gotta stay with me.
Come on, Jake.
Stay with me, Jake.
Come on, man.
Stay with me.
Come on!
Okay, gotta keep moving.
Gotta keep moving.
Please don't hurt me...
please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me!
Please don't hurt me...
Mimi?
- It's Gail and Johnston Green, honey.
You're safe.  - Oh, thanks God!
Come on, baby,
let's get out of here.
Come on.
Those are hideous.
Are those the sheets
from your old apartment?
Because you can't expect
anyone to sleep on those.
If anyone asks, we'll pretend
someone else donated them.
Your dress.
Guess I shouldn't be seeing this, huh?
The day's sort of come and gone, so...
It'll come again.
You think?
I do.
I tell you what, I've got
a pack of Ramen noodles
with your name on it,
what do you say?
Great. I'll deliver this to the shelter
and come back and wash up.
Roger, wait.
I'll come with you.
It's Mom and Dad, honey!
Stanley, you all right, sweetheart?
You need to go get in the truck
and get warm, pal.
- Where's Mimi?
- I'm right here.
Stanley, I'm right here.
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up, Jake.
Wake up.
Wake up. Oh, thank God.
We're gonna help you, honey.
We saw the storm coming
and we started to worry
when you hadn't come back.
Sweetheart...
Honey,
we're not gonna be able
to get this truck off of him.
I need you to take
these guys back to town
and get me some help out here.
You signal when you're coming back
so I know it's you, all right?
- I'll flash the lights.
- All right, go, go, go!
Jake, look at me, son.
Lookie here.
You're gonna make it, son...
I know you.
I know what you're made of.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna make it.
Stay with me now.
Robert, please,
the kids are sleeping.
- I'm sorry.
- What on earth are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jake, you'll be home real soon,
but you got to stay
with me now. Come on.
Leave me here.
Leave me alone.
Now, I'm not going anywhere.
But you got to hang on.
Now, they'll be here soon, son.
Dad...
I'm sorry.
Oh, son, you got nothing
to be sorry about.
Open your eyes, Jake.
Come on, now.
Look at me.
Look at me, Jake.
I can see her.
See who?
The girl.
What... girl?
Jake, I think you're hallucinating, son.
No, listen to me.
When I was in Iraq...
... there was a girl.
She couldn't have been more than...
10 or 12...
Don't talk now, son.
You save your energy.
We'll talk when we get... home.
I killed her, Dad.
I killed a little girl.
Hurry up!
Open your eyes, Jake.
Open your eyes.
All right, everyone on three...
One,
two, three!
All right, he's free.
Let's get the board in here.
One, two, three.
You were right.
I need to get my family
as far away from me as possible.
I've been thinking, and...
There's no other choice.
You're doing the right thing.
Listen.
After they're safe,
you and me need
to get back in the field.
That's half our team gone, Sarah,
and whoever did that
did it for a reason.
How are you gonna tell Darcy?
I'll tell her after I've moved them.
She'll never agree if she knows
I won't be staying with them.
He's better off here
than the med center.
We're still on emergency power,
and it's... it's warmer here.
Here, honey.
What about his injuries?
Well, the cut on his head
isn't very deep,
and neither one
of his legs are broken.
He's very lucky.
I'm freezing.
I'm gonna go get you
some more blankets.
You're still hypothermic.
It's just gonna take a few hours
for your body to stabilize.
- Can we have a minute?
- Oh, sure.
Dad...
What I told you out there...
please forget it.
Please.
Afraid I can't do that.
I've seen a lot of things
in my time, Jake.
I've been to war.
I know what war can do.
I know what men can do... Terrible...
... terrible things.
I know what I did.
You can talk to me.
When you're ready, son.
When you're ready.
You okay?
How's the sprain?
I think it'd be better with painkillers,
but I'm not gonna complain.
You know, for a while there, I didn't
think I'd ever feel anything again.
When I was out there,
just for a moment,
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.
And I stopped... to rest.
And then I just didn't
even want to move.
But you did.
You did make it.
And I knew you would.
Your lips are still cold.
Maybe you can warm them.
That's the worst line
I've ever heard.
I know. I've got others.
- Shut up.
- Okay.
Tomorrow morning...
we're leaving.
We're leaving?
For... for where?
I don't know yet.
You don't know?
Darcy, when I came
to get you in DC...
I told you it wasn't safe,
but I couldn't tell you why.
I'm going for a walk.
I have something
in my possession.
And there's people
out there that want it,
that will stop at nothing to get it.
And that puts you,
me and the kids
in danger here.
Okay, so th... then we go.
<i>I trust you.</i>
<i>Robert, do y...</i>
Do you trust me?
- You're late.
- You're impatient.
Then listen to me.
Okay, Sarah is not on our side.
Now... whatever's...
gone on between the two of you,
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.
Have you located the package?
Soon.
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
We've already eliminated the other
three targets without incident.
Why are you stalling on this one?
Because this one is different.

Previously on Jericho
<i>Bring them inside.</i>
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>
<i>that landed in
the middle of nowhere.</i>
<i>They've been walking
for weeks.</i>
<i>They must have gone
through hell.</i>
<i>Oh, my God... Roger.</i>
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>
<i>You need to keep
them clean and warm.</i>
<i>Do you know anyone
in Jericho?</i>
<i>Actually... I do.</i>
<i>Hello, Rob.</i>
<i>We're using the generator
to power the town hall</i>
<i>for three hours a day,
the Med Center for six.</i>
<i>With 53 new people, at current
levels of consumption...</i>
<i>we will be completely out
of gas and diesel in two weeks.</i>
<i>- Mrs. Green?
- What?</i>
<i>Eric told me that
April's pregnant.</i>
<i>It's the Old Man.</i>
<i>He's coming for us
using us against each other.</i>
<i>We go see him and if,
if he is behind this,</i>
<i>We take him out.</i>
<i>We leave first thing
in the morning.</i>
<i>Any luck out there?</i>
Sorry, ma'am.
Nothing?
Not even rabbits?
Never seen anything
like it before.
Nothing moving out there.
Think it was the fallout? Maybe it was
the radiation that killed the deer.
There'd still be dead animals,
carcasses, something.
I mean, it was weird.
Like all the game had vanished.
How far out
did you go?
15 miles out by Mill Pond
along the creek there.
Guess we're going to have
to drive, huh, Jake?
Yeah, but we have to be careful
about burning the gas rations
in the middle of winter.
We need everything we can
to run the generator.
We can live without
power for now.
Make fires to stay warm.
But we won't see Spring
if we don't eat.
Stanley and I will have to use
whatever gas we can spare.
and go out west,
Go out as far as it takes.
The rest of the hunting parties
will have to scrounge around locally.
Yeah, and Mimi's coming
with us.
What?
Well, in case something happens to me,
I want to make sure she knows...
how to trap and shoot, okay?
Look, the further you get
the hairier the roads are.
With food being
as scarce as it is,
there's bound to be
some trouble out there.
That sleeping bag's
rated to 40 below
and here's a wind-proof lighter for you.
You're going to need them both.
Good hunting.
I'm guessing the good folks
of Jericho don't know
about all this stuff down here.
- They don't know about a lot of things.
That'll be enough to get us
to the Old Man's place?
He is only about
two hours away.
I didn't realize
he was so close.
He chose the rally point.
Wanted it in his backyard.
How long as he been
watching you?
My guess...
since I stopped communications
a few days ago.
You worried about what we're
going to find out there?
- You're not.
- We can handle him.
It's you and me.
Let's get to work.
My grandmother
went fast than this
and she didn't
even have a car.
We have to take it easy,
we only have half a tank.
Well, hopefully we'll make it
to Flint Springs. It's got...
Hopefully? What do you
mean "hopefully"?
It's got a river.
It's prime white-tailed terrain.
I know, but...
This is crazy.
I told you that
I can't hunt.
Now you want me to kill Bambi.
You're gonna have to
learn, all right?
Everyone's doing their part.
Bonnie's been out twice.
Well, good for
frickin' Bonnie.
Bonnie grew up on farm.
The closest I ever got
to the outdoors
was the is the Ralph Lauren
section of Neiman Marcus.
There you go,
bargain hunting.
Same thing, but with a gun.
Bargains? At Neimans?
Sometimes I forget
that the biggest designer
in your closet is Wrangler.
What are you
laughing at?
I've never seen you in a
domestic squabble before.
Knock it off.
This isn't squabbling.
Oh, my God.
These dogs have tags.
Look at all this.
Wall Drugs.
Wall, South Dakota.
Do you think that's where all
these people were coming from?
Think about it.
South Dakota without heat,
electricity, or...
food being trucked in.
It's got to be even worse
in North Dakota,
Montana.
Oh, my God.
I read about this
at Blackjack.
Mass migration, hundreds...
maybe thousands of people
heading south.
Trying to outrun winter.
Should we be doing
that, too?

How far is it?
...60.
It's about 60 yards.
So 60 yard with almost
1.5 people per yard.
That's 90.
That's almost 100 people
just across.
The way the ground
is trampled,
you got to figure five
or tens times that amount
of people came through here.
Almost a thousand people?
Where are they going?
South Texas, Mexico.
Anyplace warmer.
It'd take weeks
to get there by foot.
God know how many thousand
people have the same idea.
Mexico's borders
could be closed.
We don't even know if
there still is a Mexico.
Maybe we should try
to catch on with them.
We can barely feed ourselves,
let alone... hundreds more.
We got to keep going.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Hey. Glad you came down.
Thank you.
- What time did you, uh...
- Early...
late, I guess.
I didn't want to wake you,
you looked so peaceful.
Peaceful? Really?
Did you have another one of those
bad dreams? Keep on there.
I guess neither one of
us got much sleep.
All I could do was think about
all these people down here, you know.
And then I remembered about the
clothes we had in the attic.
I thought that sweater
looked familiar.
Yeah, that woman was on
layover in Kansas City
when the bombs went off,
Her husband and two kids
were waiting for her at home.
Where?
Denver.
I lead these people here.
For better or worse
this is their home now.
It's on me to make sure
they're taken care of.
Yeah, of course.
What can I do to help, huh?
Talk to them,
follow your instincts.
The truth is...
I'm winging this myself.
I'll be outside.
Here.
Should be back
before dark.
And if you're not?
Just tell me when I
should start to worry.
This is the last time,
okay?
After today
I'm here...
for good, huh?
Okay.
I'll hold you to that.
Hi, honey.
How'd it go this morning?
The whole thing
was a bust.
I'm sorry, hon.
Jake's out there now.
Hopefully he and Stanley
will have better luck
than I did.
Is April here?
No, she's at
the clinic.
She promised me
she'd take a nap.
I hope it is warmer in that
clinic than it is in this house.
I think this house has
dropped ten degrees
in the last hour.
Feels like a storm's
coming in.
We'd better seal up these
windows the best was we can.
Been going around collecting
old sheets and linens.
We'll shove them
underneath the doors.
Look what I found...
hidden in Jake's closet.
Lord knows how long
that's been there.
Well, at least he was
drinking the good stuff.
I used to hide the most awful
rotgut in the world
behind my mother's
china cabinet.
What do you think?
On an empty stomach?
I'll get the glasses.
Why would anyone destroy all this.
If they'd wanted it out of commission,
they could have just taken it.
Be worth a fortune after the E.M.P.
Maybe there wasn't time,
or maybe they didn't
care about this stuff.
- How long?
- A couple of days...
Give or take.
But we just heard
from him yesterday.
We heard from someone.
Remote uplink.
Somebody else using
his access codes.
Who could have done this?
Wager for the first kill.
I'm in for a dozen eggs.
Two hours chopping wood.
Tax return consultation.
Oh, how about
foot massages for a week?
For me, not for him.
We'll talk.
Stanley, stop.
- What are they doing?
- They're blocking the whole road.
More like staking it out.
All right, turn around.
And... and go where?
I don't know. Just do it, all right?
Turn around. We'll find another road.
I see it. Damn it.
Why are they following us?
Stanley, gun it!
This should get us
back to the highway.
Then what?
We try to make it back home,
find the patrol.
Maybe they'll give up by then
or run out of gas.
Yeah, if we don't first.
Stanley...
Stanley, hold on!
Doesn't look like
he put up much of a fight.
He was probably out
before he knew what hit him.
He must have trusted whoever did it.
The thing is, whoever it was,
they knew what
they were doing there,
not over here.
I mean, look at this.
It's a mess.
But the drives...
They look like they're still intact.
The old man had information
on the entire team...
Contact information,
backgrounds...
Last known whereabouts.
Let's find out where everybody is.
We can't outrun them.
- How far till Jericho?
- Too far.
Oh, God!
Stay down.
Stay down.
Give me that drive you got there.
Must feel good to be back
in the saddle, huh?
I wish we didn't have
to come out here in the first place.
What, are you getting soft on me?
Too much domestic bliss?
Not quite bliss.
There.
There it is. We're in.
Thank you.
Karaoke bullfighter, right?
Excuse me?
At that bar in Barcelona.
You decked a bullfighter who tried
to get you to stop singing that song...
"Stairway to Heaven"?
Did Roger tell you that?
He also mentioned you like Oreo,
ice cream and white daisies.
Don't be mad at him.
He was trying to keep us entertained.
He kept talking and,
somehow, we kept moving.
Hey. How you doing?
I'm a little tired.
I'm going to head home
and get cleaned up.
Think I'll stay here for a
little longer if you don't mind.
Yeah. Of course.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Looks like you owe
these folks a rematch.
So, um...
I will see you when I see you.
- To Jake.
- To Jake.
Who would have thought,
six months ago, you'd be toasting him?
Well, God knows Eric wouldn't
have hidden the bottle.
You and Jake have always
had much more in common
than you wanted to admit.
You going hunting
all those weekends...
Why that kid got sit
in a deer stand for hours?
We wouldn't say a word
to each other. Just...
be in the woods together.
I was always afraid that Jake
would forget about that.
You know, that he'd grow up only
remembering the bad times. That we were
That he wouldn't remember
that we had been close.
That we were... buddies once.
He remembers...
deep down.
That's why you mean
so much to him.
Boy, that wind sounds awful.
I hope Stanley and Jake
are okay out there.
What happened?
Jake, Stanley's not moving.
- What?
- Stanley's not moving.
Oh, my God. Go hide.
- Go hide.
- No
- Go on.
- No, No. Stanley...
You'll be fine.
Go! Go hide!
Come on.
Help me with Stanley.
I can't move.
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.
That's half the team.
We're being hunted.
It's worse than that.
It's Woodworth and his wife.
They were in Richmond.
That's his daughter.
Anyone close to us
is in danger, too.
No loose ends.
Don't worry about your family.
We're not going to let
anything happen to them.
It's just us, Chavez
and Cheung left.
We'll get back out on the field,
stay in the weeds
until we can connect
with the chief.
Here. Look at this.
What is that?
If we are being hunted,
there... is the hunter.
Stanley, are you okay?
Can you get up?
Your leg?
I think I busted my ankle.
I'm okay.
I'm just stuck.
- Let me try to get this off.
- Stanley, don't.
We can't do this ourselves.
You might make it worse.
Maybe you could dig me out.
All right.
Help me get the shovels. They're in
the bed of the truck.
It's gone.
All right, get the jack.
The jack's back there.
They took everything.
How was your bath?
Lukewarm, then luke-cold,
then pretty much icy.
- Look. Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.
Times Square,
New Year's Eve, 2005.
Wasted.
That hangover was epic.
Do you remember the last thing I said to
you the night before you left Jericho ?
That I was selfish
and I didn't listen?
Something like that?
You have no idea how that ate
at me while you were gone.
- I just kept thinking that was
the last  - You were right.
You know, today,
seeing you with those people...
It was like you had found yourself.
I'm still just trying to figure
it out, you know?
We're not these people anymore.
But I'll tell you the one thing
that hasn't changed.
The one constant.
I love you.
And it's going
to take a whole lot more
than the end of the world
to change that.
- How are your legs?
- I don't know I can't feel anything.
The ground's
frozen solid.
It's sucking the heat
right out of you.
Why can't we build a fire?
You smell the fumes?
You have to get back to town.
All right. I'm going
to try and go.
No. You can't on that ankle.
- I'll go.
- No. Those guys are still out there.
They went the other way.
Jericho has a patrol
five miles out of town.
We can't have come
more than ten.
Jake, it's too dangerous.
What are our options?
With no bags, no fire?
All right, one of you goes
or we all die here.
All right, fine, fine.
I threw a flashlight over there
somewhere. You might need it.
Listen...
stay on the shoulder
the whole time, okay?
If you see any headlights
or you hear any engines,
get low and hide,
all right?
Now, you're gonna
want to head
southeast.
Stanley, that doesn't mean
anything to me.
Stay on this road.
Stay on this road
and then you make...
make your first left
Okay?
And you're gonna go about a mile
and then you're gonna make
your second right,
and you're gonna make another right
and then another left.
And then once you get to the crossroads
of the highway, you're home free...
You'll see a big sign pointing
to the way to Jericho, okay?
Got it?
Left, second right.
Right, left,
Right.
Mimi, I...
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.
<i>Here's what we're gonna do:</i>
I know a place that's safe.
We take Darcy and the kids
out of Jericho
and stash them before you and I
get back on the move.
I am not leaving them alone.
- I don't think you have a choice.
- No...
See, because I've got leverage.
If they kill me, they will
never find the package.
It's not you
they're gonna kill.
It'll be Sam
or Darcy or me;
anything they can use
to get to you.
Anything they can
use to get to me.
The body.
These... These, uh...
...these half-smashed drives,
<i>...this whole...</i>
this whole setup--
If someone had wanted
to destroy all this,
why leave the house
standing, huh?
Why not just burn it all down?
Someone wanted us
to see all this.
We're being played.
Why would anyone go through
all that trouble?
I don't know,
but this is all too big now.
There's too many angles
to cover.
Too many unknowns.
I need to get home.
- Robert, wait.
- What?
Let's think about this.
What's the plan?
What are you going to do?
You know, maybe the plan all
along was to get us out here.
I gotta protect
my family, Sarah.
And what about the package?
It'll need to be moved.
This isn't so bad, right?
Hey, we've been
through worse.
Remember the time we got stuck on
the roof of the...
town hall in the middle
of a lightning storm, huh?
We were so afraid the lightning
was going to...
blow up the fireworks.
You squealed like a little girl
wanting to jump off that roof.
That was you.
Your voice hadn't changed yet.
Please, I had you beat by,
like, six months.
Drink some water.
It's frozen right through.
What?
I saw an abandoned cabin about
a quarter mile up the road.
You need to get inside.
It'll hurt, but you can make it.
- Jake, I'm staying.
- Listen to me!
There's no point in both of us
freezing to death out there.
- She's coming back.
- When?
She's been gone for, like,
an hour.
It'll take her a little while to
reach the patrol,
but when she does,
she'll find someone.
I know she'll find someone.
Unless somebody finds her first.
Look,
it's gonna get dark soon,
you need to go.
You wouldn't leave me
any more than I'm leaving you.
Mimi's strong.
She'll find her way.
Wait...
he said keep going east.
No... southeast.
And... look for a sign.
Oh, God, I hate this place!
Come on, man.
You can't fall asleep.
You got to stay up;
come on.
You stopped shivering.
Come on.
You got to talk to me--
come on, come on, buddy.
You gotta talk to me.
Talk to me, buddy.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
About what?
Five years ago.
Sorry I left the way I did.
Iit's okay. It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
I was gonna call.
I was gonna call.
I know. Listen, I want you
to forget about it, okay?
We never got to go backpacking
in Costa Rica.
You know what?
We're still gonna get to go
backpacking in Costa Rica, okay?
We're gonna...
we're gonna learn how to surf.
We're gonna sleep
on the beach.
As soon as the planes
are up and running again,
it's gonna be you and me.
Hell, you can fly us
there yourself, huh?
Come on. Come on.
Tell me something good, man.
I haven't talked to you in five years.
You've been gone for five years.
Tell me... Hey, tell me
about San Diego.
How was it?
- Warm.
- Warm, right.
Beaches, blondes, huh?
What were you doing there?
Flying, flying planes.
Really?
That's cool, man.
Your grandfather
would've been psyched, huh?
Did you have a girl there?
I know you had a girl.
She's dead.
What do you mean?
You don't know that.
I mean, it all depends on where she was
when the bombs went off, right?
I mean, she could
have made it, right?
- Tell me what her name was.
- She's dead....
It was my fault.
- It's not your fault.
- Let me lay down.
- Jake, no.
- Let me lay down.
It wasn't your fault.
Come on... Come on...
Come on, stay with me.
You gotta stay with me.
Come on, Jake.
Stay with me, Jake.
Come on, man.
Stay with me.
Come on!
Okay, gotta keep moving.
Gotta keep moving.
Please don't hurt me...
please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me!
Please don't hurt me...
Mimi?
- It's Gail and Johnston Green, honey.
You're safe.  - Oh, thanks God!
Come on, baby,
let's get out of here.
Come on.
Those are hideous.
Are those the sheets
from your old apartment?
Because you can't expect
anyone to sleep on those.
If anyone asks, we'll pretend
someone else donated them.
Your dress.
Guess I shouldn't be seeing this, huh?
The day's sort of come and gone, so...
It'll come again.
You think?
I do.
I tell you what, I've got
a pack of Ramen noodles
with your name on it,
what do you say?
Great. I'll deliver this to the shelter
and come back and wash up.
Roger, wait.
I'll come with you.
It's Mom and Dad, honey!
Stanley, you all right, sweetheart?
You need to go get in the truck
and get warm, pal.
- Where's Mimi?
- I'm right here.
Stanley, I'm right here.
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up, Jake.
Wake up.
Wake up. Oh, thank God.
We're gonna help you, honey.
We saw the storm coming
and we started to worry
when you hadn't come back.
Sweetheart...
Honey,
we're not gonna be able
to get this truck off of him.
I need you to take
these guys back to town
and get me some help out here.
You signal when you're coming back
so I know it's you, all right?
- I'll flash the lights.
- All right, go, go, go!
Jake, look at me, son.
Lookie here.
You're gonna make it, son...
I know you.
I know what you're made of.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna make it.
Stay with me now.
Robert, please,
the kids are sleeping.
- I'm sorry.
- What on earth are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jake, you'll be home real soon,
but you got to stay
with me now. Come on.
Leave me here.
Leave me alone.
Now, I'm not going anywhere.
But you got to hang on.
Now, they'll be here soon, son.
Dad...
I'm sorry.
Oh, son, you got nothing
to be sorry about.
Open your eyes, Jake.
Come on, now.
Look at me.
Look at me, Jake.
I can see her.
See who?
The girl.
What... girl?
Jake, I think you're hallucinating, son.
No, listen to me.
When I was in Iraq...
... there was a girl.
She couldn't have been more than...
10 or 12...
Don't talk now, son.
You save your energy.
We'll talk when we get... home.
I killed her, Dad.
I killed a little girl.
Hurry up!
Open your eyes, Jake.
Open your eyes.
All right, everyone on three...
One,
two, three!
All right, he's free.
Let's get the board in here.
One, two, three.
You were right.
I need to get my family
as far away from me as possible.
I've been thinking, and...
There's no other choice.
You're doing the right thing.
Listen.
After they're safe,
you and me need
to get back in the field.
That's half our team gone, Sarah,
and whoever did that
did it for a reason.
How are you gonna tell Darcy?
I'll tell her after I've moved them.
She'll never agree if she knows
I won't be staying with them.
He's better off here
than the med center.
We're still on emergency power,
and it's... it's warmer here.
Here, honey.
What about his injuries?
Well, the cut on his head
isn't very deep,
and neither one
of his legs are broken.
He's very lucky.
I'm freezing.
I'm gonna go get you
some more blankets.
You're still hypothermic.
It's just gonna take a few hours
for your body to stabilize.
- Can we have a minute?
- Oh, sure.
Dad...
What I told you out there...
please forget it.
Please.
Afraid I can't do that.
I've seen a lot of things
in my time, Jake.
I've been to war.
I know what war can do.
I know what men can do... Terrible...
... terrible things.
I know what I did.
You can talk to me.
When you're ready, son.
When you're ready.
You okay?
How's the sprain?
I think it'd be better with painkillers,
but I'm not gonna complain.
You know, for a while there, I didn't
think I'd ever feel anything again.
When I was out there,
just for a moment,
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.
And I stopped... to rest.
And then I just didn't
even want to move.
But you did.
You did make it.
And I knew you would.
Your lips are still cold.
Maybe you can warm them.
That's the worst line
I've ever heard.
I know. I've got others.
- Shut up.
- Okay.
Tomorrow morning...
we're leaving.
We're leaving?
For... for where?
I don't know yet.
You don't know?
Darcy, when I came
to get you in DC...
I told you it wasn't safe,
but I couldn't tell you why.
I'm going for a walk.
I have something
in my possession.
And there's people
out there that want it,
that will stop at nothing to get it.
And that puts you,
me and the kids
in danger here.
Okay, so th... then we go.
<i>I trust you.</i>
<i>Robert, do y...</i>
Do you trust me?
- You're late.
- You're impatient.
Then listen to me.
Okay, Sarah is not on our side.
Now... whatever's...
gone on between the two of you,
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.
Have you located the package?
Soon.
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
We've already eliminated the other
three targets without incident.
Why are you stalling on this one?
Because this one is different.

<i>Previously on Jericho</i>
Some of them were on planes
that landed in
the middle of nowhere.
They've been walking for weeks.
They must have gone
through hell.
Oh, my God.
Roger.
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that
Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team
sold us all out.
You're smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.
At current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.
We can live without
power for now,
but we won't see spring
if we don't eat.
All right, look,
the further out you get,
the hairier the roads are,
and food being
as scarce as it is,
there's bound to be
trouble out there.
Why are they following us?
Stanley, hold on!
Jake!
It's Mom and Dad, honey!
You're going to be all right.
So, I'm being watched?
It's the Old Man.
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.
If they kill me,
they will never find the package.
I have something
in my possession,
and there's people
out there that want it.
And that puts you, me
and the kids in danger here.
Then listen to me...
Sarah is not on our side.
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.
He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
- Why are you stalling on this one?
Because this one is different.
You won't make it out of Kansas
with the fuel you've got,
and you're not going to find
another drop out there.
The folks who left last week
are probably in Arizona by now.
If they weren't
murdered on the highway.
It is suicide to leave, Ridley.
There's no food, no heat.
It's suicide if we stay.
This... this is everything.
I mean, it's every farm.
At least until the spring crops come in,
and that could take months.
And what if we don't
factor in the refugees?
They're a part of this town now.
A lot of extra mouths to feed.
They've done their part, Gray.
They've helped hunt,
cut firewood...
Resources they use up five times
faster than they supply them.
When the windmills come in
from New Bern,
most of our fuel issues
will be solved.
What about every day until then?
Ridley and his group
are about to leave.
If people want to try and make it
on their own, that's their right.
You know as well as I do that
come springtime,
we'll find their bodies out there.
Well, what do you want me to do,
Johnston?
Wh-What am I missing
that's not on that board?
You find it for me,
'cause I don't see it.
Without some "X" factor,
we're not going to make it
through the winter.
Not all of us.
We have to make
some hard decisions.
And I think the last ones in
should be the first ones to go.
Clear the streets!
We need to clear the streets!
Who's in charge here?
I'm Gray Anderson.
I'm the mayor of Jericho.
Glad to meet you,
Mayor Anderson.
I'm Gunnery Sergeant Hill.
Fourth MAR-DIV,
Fourth Tank Battalion,
Charlie Company.
So you're...?
Sir,
we're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.

They sent the marines?
We were deployed to Western Kansas
to set up a firm base
and prep the outlying towns for the
arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Now that we've won the war,
it's time to start rebuilding.
War? What war?
- You didn't hear?
- No.
We lost all communications
after the EMP.
Well, we nuked the hell
out of North Korea and Iran.
So they were behind it?
From what I hear, which isn't much,
Iran financed it,
North Korea supplied the bombs.
We've got troops all over the world
going after the...
terrorists who snuck them in,
but at least we took
out the big dogs.
What happens now?
Largest reconstruction effort
in the history of the country.
So there's somebody
finally in charge?
The former secretary of HHS
is now the president.
We heard there
were six guys
from six different capitals
claiming to be president.
Resolved.
The federal government
is reunifying in Columbus, Ohio.
How did they
decide on Columbus?
All I know is, my orders are coming
from the commanding officer
of the Fourth Battalion,
and
those are to restore lights,
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.
W- Wait, wait.
When is that going to happen?
Should have your shelves full of Oreos
and Hot Pockets by the end of the year.
Welcome back to the grid, Jericho.
Thank God for
the US Marines.
Hey! Hey! It's over.
There are kids out here.
Get a room.
Come on. We should have been
on the road yesterday.
Well, I'm packed.
Hi. We're all fueled up.
How are we doing?
We'll be ready when we're ready.
I'll get the rest of my things
from downstairs.
How many more times
are we going to have to move?
- This should do it.
- Really?
You're going to stay in
one place from now on?
Sergeant Green. Marine Corps?
Ah, hell, no.
Army Rangers.
Well, I'll try not to hold it
against you.
Listen, Gunny, how long
before the engineers get here?
Could be two days,
could be two weeks.
In the meantime, why don't you get
a wish list of what you need,
and I'll forward that on to Battalion
Headquarters in Dodge City,
and we'll start to get y'all back on
your feet.  - Roger that.
Just tell me how
I can be of service.
Going to need
a command post.
- Use the sheriff's office.
- Great.
Excuse me.
If you guys are going
to be here for a while,
why don't I take your men
over to my tavern.
Thanks, ma'am,
my troops could use it.
Wymore!
Front and center!
Move it, move it!
Muster up and follow
this young lady here.
The liberty call is
sounded, but remember...
conduct yourselves like marines.
- Aye Sir.
Don't you "sir" me, PFC.
I work for a living.
Dismissed!
Aye, aye, Gunnery Sergeant.
Couple of months ago, I would have had
that kid doing push-ups till he puked,
but, uh, they've
been through a lot.
I understand.
Anything else we can do?
Well, Sergeant, uh...
one other thing.
Corporal Mullin!
Hi. Uh, I'm looking to scavenge
some replacement parts.
Our radio, well, it took
a couple of pretty good hits.
Do you have any idea
where I could start?
Maybe I could help.
Oh, Lance Corporal Mullin.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
So you're the town's
electronics expert?
No, I'm not an expert
at anything.
- But I can improvise.
- I'll take that.
We'll see what
we can find.
So, uh...
I've been thinking...
Maybe leaving my family...
isn't such a good idea.
What?
Why?
We've been over this.
They-they're not safe
here with you.
I know.
There are people out there
who would...
hurt them in order to get to me.
But at least I understand
the dangers.
I can protect them.
You're not thinking straight.
This is my family, Sarah.
It never mattered before.
Now it does.
What's it going to take...
someone slitting your wife's throat
before you get it ?
You're right.
We will drop them
at the safe house,
and then we'll keep moving.
It's the right thing for them.
I just realized...
Hmm?
If the government
is up and running,
you know what that means, right?
- No
Paperwork.
They'll need
accountants again.
Does that mean I'm back in debt?
Don't be so negative.
New York made it.
Come next summer,
I'll be taking walks
though Central Park.
What?
Dude!
This is awesome!
I could totally
be a marine.
I could totally see that happening...
Except for everything about you.
God, I...
Don't worry about her.
It's a phase, trust me.
The minute everything
calms down,
he's as good as gone.
Yeah, yeah, maybe
you can give him a ride
out of town
on the way to New York.
Thinking about leaving
this town is not
the same thing as thinking
about leaving you.
No?
Well, it adds up to
the same thing, Mimi.
Maybe you could
come with me.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.
That's not my life.
Well, this isn't mine.
I've missed you.
Me, too.
We should get going.
Start loading up
the truck, huh?
Go on, get out of here.
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm better than the truck.
Be able to quit worrying about you
one of these days, right?
Hey, Jake.
Amazing, huh?
Yeah, it's great news.
I'll see you later.
How are most of
the towns out there?
Let's just say
I haven't seen
anything like this
since we entered the CZ.
"CZ"?
Contamination Zone.
You're in CZ-12,
and you're better
off than most.
That's hard to imagine.
Try taking a walk through what's
left of Lawrence, Kansas.
What's it like?
Buildings
are all gone.
People who are left are
fighting their neighbors
for food and water.
Makes you wonder if the
survivors are the lucky ones.
We need a transistor
for their radio.
Can we take
apart the jukebox?
Oh, you're going to take
my music?
Isn't there anything else
you can take apart?
You've got three
Spin Doctors albums on here.
Trust me, it's a public service.
Don't worry, there's an old
ham radio in City Hall.
Maybe we can take that apart.
- Thanks anyway.
- Bye.
Oh, hey, big guy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I think you have something
of mine.
Sweetie,
let's sit down on the couch.
Your dad and I have
some talking to do.
You go ahead, Sam.
Just play with
your coloring books.
This is what you want, right?
Among other things.
You been lying to me, Robert.
When did you fall back
in love with your wife?
It's okay.
You go back to your book.
Go ahead.
We tried to institute
rationing early on,
but it took some time
for people to accept
that we were really
on our own.
Looks like you did a better job
than most towns I've seen.
Town's lucky to have
a military man in charge.
Well, I guess we
made out all right.
With salt from my mine,
we've been able to do
some trading with nearby towns.
Your town seems
to have been blessed.
That said, uh...
I can't say you'll be
a priority on the list.
Um, uh...
Wait a minute... what list?
We got detachments all over Kansas
assessing each town's needs.
Relief is given
on an as needed basis.
Wait a second.
You're saying that because
we planned better than others
it will come against us?
We can make out for
a while longer if we have to.
That's easy for you to say.
You're not being held accountable.
Why don't you give me
that want list and, uh,
I'll see what I can do.
Try that one.
Perfect.
So you're really not going
to tell me what happened?
Doc says frostbite.
Doctor also say
who kicked your ass?
Someone ran us off the road.
Most of it's a blur.
Just, uh,
tried to stay alive, you know?
I do.
- So, the marines, huh?
- Yeah.
Is it everything you hoped for?
There are moments.
But when I signed up, I never
thought I'd be fighting Americans.
Good people forced
to do bad things.
That's got to be rough.
I'm sorry.
It's not your problem.
What?
Just, uh,
wondering why someone like you
would join the marines.
Someone like me?
I had an office job
until a few years ago,
but I got bored.
I wanted to see the world.
- Have you?
- I've seen Omaha.
- You?
- What, seen the world? Yeah.
Yeah, I just saw
all the wrong places.
Man,
you have this brooding,
bad-boy thing down to an art.
The video I was sent
before the attacks,
those people were not
holding you captive.
You were just...
what, you were playing me?
Me playing you?
We were living together.
I showed up here
and you have a family again.
It's okay.
It's just a...
a story, you know?
It's just a story we're telling.
Go back to your book.
You made me promises, Robert.
Who were the people in that video?
Is that who you're working for?
I was. Now,
I'm working for myself.
So why don't you
give me what I want,
and then this story
can have a happy ending.
What are you gonna do
in the Marines finally...
- cut you loose?
- I try not to think about it.
That means you have.
After everything I've seen...
I'd like to find a nice little town
and just settle in
for the duration.
I don't think those
exist anymore.
I just found out they do.
What about you?
You ever thought
about flying again?
Maybe for the military?
Sure. Safer than being
on the ground, right?
Not if you're a radio operator.
I'm the safest of all.
I get to ride in the tank.
But if you ride in the tank,
how'd the radio get shot?
What, you think a girl can't...
get out and kick some ass
every once in a while?
Who you trying to call
on that thing anyway?
Uh, division headquarters
in Dodge City.
That's about 200 miles away.
This thing's made it farther.
Of course, that was
before it took some rounds.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV,
this is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
This is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>
<I>We've been trying to raise you
on this frequency for days.
<I>Division needs the entire
fourth tank battalion RTB ASAP.
<I>Do you copy?
Aye, aye, sir.
<I>Make that most tricky-tick, Corporal.
Roger that,
Charlie Company Actual, out.
What's going on?
We just got ordered
back to Dodge City.
What are you going to do
with the package, Sarah?
Sell it.
And get as far away
from here as possible.
What happened to you?
The last few months,
I've learned two things.
Everybody has a price.
And everybody lies.
Sit still, Sam.
- Take your...
- Stay there
I was just having a conversation
with your husband...
about what's more
important to him...
His job...
or his family.
Why are you leaving ?
Because we were
ordered to.
Sorry, but I can't reveal
operational orders.
Army Corps of Engineers
will be through eventually.
Eventually?
How long?
Sir, listen, I'm sorry,
but I just don't know.
You ready to roll?
Good to go, Gunny.
But I don't know
about the tank.
Don't know if we have enough fuel
to make it back to Dodge City.
Leave it behind
if we have to.
We'll post Sigloch and Kent here
till we can make it back.
Sergeant, without armor we're
sitting ducks for those highwaymen.
We're marines. We'll make do.
I can get you fuel.
Not much, but enough
to get you back to Dodge.
Just give me an hour.
I'm listening.
Plus... whatever
supplies you need.
But I just need assurances that
Jericho will be taken care of.
There's three C-130s
full of Red Cross supplies
that are supposed to arrive
in Kansas in 12 days.
I guarantee you'll be
at the top of their list.
That's all I ask.
All right, people,
listen up!
We're going to stand
down for one hour.
When the relief effort comes,
are you guys coming with it?
No.
You're going have to flirt with
a whole new batch of grunts.
And the Corps of Engineers
are nowhere near
as cute as I am.
You should think about...
coming back when you get out.
What would I do here?
That's a question we're all
asking ourselves, but...
you're a good fit.
You know,
before all this started,
I might have agreed with you.
But, uh...
I won't make it back here.
Corporal Mullin!
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant.
Why is your gear
not loaded up?
- Uh...
- Don't answer that.
We're headed over
to the town hall.
The mayor wants
to express his appreciation.
Somebody needs to stay here.
You...
Youjust drew
the short straw.
Aye, Gunny.
I'm going to go get
the last of the supplies
from the sheriff's office.
Get the package.
You know I can't do that.
You think I'm going
to believe a word you say?
Come on. We can work this out.
You had your chance
to go with me.
Please!
Shut up!
You're losing something tonight.
I promise you that.
Only question is,
is it going to be something
with a heartbeat?
I'll get the package.
Please put that gun down.
Why don't you get
Allison down here, too?
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>
Do you copy?
Lima Charlie,
it's cold as hell out here.
Hello?
This is Jake Green.
Jake Green, this is an official
Marine channel.
Get off this...
Hello?
Hello. Are you taking fire?
Hey, Gunny!
It's just a little something
to remember us by.
This is too kind, Mr. Mayor,
but, uh, we really
should press on.
No, you can't take off
on an empty stomach.
Come on in, I got
a little surprise for you.
Just something to show our
gratitude. Come on.
I need you to grab some of
our guys from patrol
and do a sweep of the
area, all right? Take guns.
Are you kidding?
I mean, we got
the US Marines Corps here.
Something's wrong about all this.
Trust me.
Okay, okay. Well...
what am I looking for?
A guy with a radio for starters.
Check anywhere within
earshot of the fireworks.
All right, maybe it's
nothing. Just check.
- All right? Go!
- Okay.
I can't talk.
What?
It's good talking to you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Honored guests.
I was very hopeful
that former Sergeant Green
might like to
say a few words.
Ladies and gentlemen, um...
Marine Corps has a motto
"Semper fidelis"
Always faithful.
And I think it's very fitting
that in our darkest hour,
it was marines who came
to our rescue.
Never before
in our nation's history
has a motto been so tried...
...and so necessary.
Gunny, Marines,
semper fi.
So, Gunny,
the Fighting Fourth.
Seen more than
your share of action.
From Iwo to Iraq, if there's a war,
there's the fourth.
Semper fi.
Excuse us a second.
What is the matter?
What's going on?
Downstairs.
I just, uh...
I heard the fireworks
over the marines' radio,
and Dodge City
is 200 miles away.
- What?  - They've got somebody
on the edge of town
pretending
to be their headquarters.
I sent Stanley and a couple of
the guys to check it out.
Tell me I'm crazy.
If you are, so am I.
Nobody calls an NCO "sir,"
and a marine
would never say, "Hoo-ah."
That's an Army thing.
These guys
did both.
Marines are all
about detail.
Well, if they're not marines,
who are they?
People with enough firepower
to wipe us out.
And we gave them half
the town's supplies.
What do we do?
Well, we've got to tell Gray.
How do we get Gray alone?
He's right next to them.
We got to do something
about that tank.
That thing gets turned lose
on Main Street,
it'll be a
bloodbath.
Even if you get that tank, they'll still
have a room full of hostages.
She's right.
We better get back before
they start to wonder.
Try to get a message to Gray,
and I'll wait for Stanley.
I'll see what I can do
about the tank.
Hey.
How was Dodge City picking up
our fireworks?
We pick up pops and pings
all the time...
Don't lie to me!
<i>Hello? Anyone out there?</i>
Stanley, is that you?
Jake, we found this guy
camping out here
with this radio.
Says he's with the marines.
I'm going to bring him back.
Is any of this real?
The gun's real.
I'm sorry.
You con people out
of stale food
and enough fuel to get
to the next town?
You don't know how bad
it is out there.
Yeah, I do.
Where'd you get all this?
There was a food riot
in our refugee camp.
A dozen marines
never had a chance
against 10,000 starving people.
So you killed them?
They retreated
and we took what they left.
Tried to get some food
in the next town.
It worked so well,
we kept doing it.
Don't.
You're not leaving town
with those supplies.
Don't get yourself killed
doing something stupid, Jake.
I don't want that
on my conscience.
You don't have it in you.
Open it.
Step... back.
My God.
- This has been here the whole time?
- It is not armed,
and the lead blocks
all the radiation...
- You brought that into our house?!
- D...
We were almost out of here,
and you told him, Maggie?
He figured it out.
He heard the fireworks
on the radio.
- So what do we do with him now?
- What do you mean?
Let's just leave.
And what...
wait for him to tell the whole town
when we're half a mile out?
It'll be Greenville
all over again.
We're not killers.
I was a P. E. teacher
who saw too many movies.
Now I'm a marine.
I'm adapting.
- No.
- It's him or us.
I vote for you.
You know, ammunition
being in such short supply,
I doubt those weapons
are even loaded.
You want to take that chance?
I know damn well this one is.
Son of a... bitch!
Get your hands up!
Get them up!
Get up.
How dare you wear
that uniform!
It's not a uniform...
it's a costume.
Half the towns we go through
don't even fly the flag.
Wait. Everything you said
about the war, North Korea,
it was all a lie?
Some of it we heard,
some we made up.
It's anybody's guess what's really
going on out there.
Well, we still have laws
in Jericho,
and tomorrow I'm going to let the town
decide what to do with you.
We can't do that, Gray.
The hell we can't!
People need to know
what we're up against.
Not like this.
Well, they're going to find out
eventually.
Yeah, they will.
And by then, the worst
of it will be over.
But food's not enough.
You said it yourself.
Without some "X" factor,
we don't make it through the winter.
Well, this is it.
People need faith
just as much as they need food.
And what the hell
do we do with them?
Then we give a hero's exit.
Ooh-rah.
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?
I won't follow you.
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.
My God.
I'll leave him
just outside of town.
No!
- Dad!
- Allie, get them out of here!
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.
- I'm sorry.
- Dad...
I'm fine.
Let me take this.
You are not fine.
Robert, we are not fine!
How long till-till
more people come after you?
Huh, after us?
- Come on, D, we're safe here.
- Don't...!
We'll never be safe with you.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, baby girl.
Move out! Let's go!
Our own personal escort
out of town?
Look, you're a smart girl,
you need to get out
before these guys get you killed.
And go where?
Towns aren't taking refugees,
and there's only one thing
they want women for.
Stay here... all right,
you'll be safe.
It's not going to work.
Not after the story we told.
Not now, Mimi.
Like hell not now, Cornhusker.
Cornhuskers are from Nebraska.
I'm a Jayhawk.
What? What?
You drive me so crazy,
and you know that
I can't stay here forever, but...
the truth is...
I can't live without you, either.
Really?
Yes, really.
We got enough food to get all of you
a few days down the road.
Hey, how about some water, man?
Make do.
You'll leave your weapons
on the tank,
and you will move out.
Do it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Be careful.
What do we do?
We soldier on.
What do we do with that?
Got room in your barn?
Seriously?
Why not.
Never know when
you might need a tank.

as scarce as it is,
there's bound to be
trouble out there.
Why are they following us?
Stanley, hold on!
Jake!
It's Mom and Dad, honey!
You're going to be all right.
So, I'm being watched?
It's the Old Man.
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.
If they kill me,
they will never find the package.
I have something
in my possession,
and there's people
out there that want it.
And that puts you, me
and the kids in danger here.
Then listen to me...
Sarah is not on our side.
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.
He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
- Why are you stalling on this one?
Because this one is different.
You won't make it out of Kansas
with the fuel you've got,
and you're not going to find
another drop out there.
The folks who left last week
are probably in Arizona by now.
If they weren't
murdered on the highway.
It is suicide to leave, Ridley.
There's no food, no heat.
It's suicide if we stay.
This... this is everything.
I mean, it's every farm.
At least until the spring crops come in,
and that could take months.
And what if we don't
factor in the refugees?
They're a part of this town now.
A lot of extra mouths to feed.
They've done their part, Gray.
They've helped hunt,
cut firewood...
Resources they use up five times
faster than they supply them.
When the windmills come in
from New Bern,
most of our fuel issues
will be solved.
What about every day until then?
Ridley and his group
are about to leave.
If people want to try and make it
on their own, that's their right.
You know as well as I do that
come springtime,
we'll find their bodies out there.
Well, what do you want me to do,
Johnston?
Wh-What am I missing
that's not on that board?
You find it for me,
'cause I don't see it.
Without some "X" factor,
we're not going to make it
through the winter.
Not all of us.
We have to make
some hard decisions.
And I think the last ones in
should be the first ones to go.
Clear the streets!
We need to clear the streets!
Who's in charge here?
I'm Gray Anderson.
I'm the mayor of Jericho.
Glad to meet you,
Mayor Anderson.
I'm Gunnery Sergeant Hill.
Fourth MAR-DIV,
Fourth Tank Battalion,
Charlie Company.
So you're...?
Sir,
we're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.

They sent the marines?
We were deployed to Western Kansas
to set up a firm base
and prep the outlying towns for the
arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Now that we've won the war,
it's time to start rebuilding.
War? What war?
- You didn't hear?
- No.
We lost all communications
after the EMP.
Well, we nuked the hell
out of North Korea and Iran.
So they were behind it?
From what I hear, which isn't much,
Iran financed it,
North Korea supplied the bombs.
We've got troops all over the world
going after the...
terrorists who snuck them in,
but at least we took
out the big dogs.
What happens now?
Largest reconstruction effort
in the history of the country.
So there's somebody
finally in charge?
The former secretary of HHS
is now the president.
We heard there
were six guys
from six different capitals
claiming to be president.
Resolved.
The federal government
is reunifying in Columbus, Ohio.
How did they
decide on Columbus?
All I know is, my orders are coming
from the commanding officer
of the Fourth Battalion,
and
those are to restore lights,
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.
W- Wait, wait.
When is that going to happen?
Should have your shelves full of Oreos
and Hot Pockets by the end of the year.
Welcome back to the grid, Jericho.
Thank God for
the US Marines.
Hey! Hey! It's over.
There are kids out here.
Get a room.
Come on. We should have been
on the road yesterday.
Well, I'm packed.
Hi. We're all fueled up.
How are we doing?
We'll be ready when we're ready.
I'll get the rest of my things
from downstairs.
How many more times
are we going to have to move?
- This should do it.
- Really?
You're going to stay in
one place from now on?
Sergeant Green. Marine Corps?
Ah, hell, no.
Army Rangers.
Well, I'll try not to hold it
against you.
Listen, Gunny, how long
before the engineers get here?
Could be two days,
could be two weeks.
In the meantime, why don't you get
a wish list of what you need,
and I'll forward that on to Battalion
Headquarters in Dodge City,
and we'll start to get y'all back on
your feet.  - Roger that.
Just tell me how
I can be of service.
Going to need
a command post.
- Use the sheriff's office.
- Great.
Excuse me.
If you guys are going
to be here for a while,
why don't I take your men
over to my tavern.
Thanks, ma'am,
my troops could use it.
Wymore!
Front and center!
Move it, move it!
Muster up and follow
this young lady here.
The liberty call is
sounded, but remember...
conduct yourselves like marines.
- Aye Sir.
Don't you "sir" me, PFC.
I work for a living.
Dismissed!
Aye, aye, Gunnery Sergeant.
Couple of months ago, I would have had
that kid doing push-ups till he puked,
but, uh, they've
been through a lot.
I understand.
Anything else we can do?
Well, Sergeant, uh...
one other thing.
Corporal Mullin!
Hi. Uh, I'm looking to scavenge
some replacement parts.
Our radio, well, it took
a couple of pretty good hits.
Do you have any idea
where I could start?
Maybe I could help.
Oh, Lance Corporal Mullin.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
So you're the town's
electronics expert?
No, I'm not an expert
at anything.
- But I can improvise.
- I'll take that.
We'll see what
we can find.
So, uh...
I've been thinking...
Maybe leaving my family...
isn't such a good idea.
What?
Why?
We've been over this.
They-they're not safe
here with you.
I know.
There are people out there
who would...
hurt them in order to get to me.
But at least I understand
the dangers.
I can protect them.
You're not thinking straight.
This is my family, Sarah.
It never mattered before.
Now it does.
What's it going to take...
someone slitting your wife's throat
before you get it ?
You're right.
We will drop them
at the safe house,
and then we'll keep moving.
It's the right thing for them.
I just realized...
Hmm?
If the government
is up and running,
you know what that means, right?
- No
Paperwork.
They'll need
accountants again.
Does that mean I'm back in debt?
Don't be so negative.
New York made it.
Come next summer,
I'll be taking walks
though Central Park.
What?
Dude!
This is awesome!
I could totally
be a marine.
I could totally see that happening...
Except for everything about you.
God, I...
Don't worry about her.
It's a phase, trust me.
The minute everything
calms down,
he's as good as gone.
Yeah, yeah, maybe
you can give him a ride
out of town
on the way to New York.
Thinking about leaving
this town is not
the same thing as thinking
about leaving you.
No?
Well, it adds up to
the same thing, Mimi.
Maybe you could
come with me.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.
That's not my life.
Well, this isn't mine.
I've missed you.
Me, too.
We should get going.
Start loading up
the truck, huh?
Go on, get out of here.
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm better than the truck.
Be able to quit worrying about you
one of these days, right?
Hey, Jake.
Amazing, huh?
Yeah, it's great news.
I'll see you later.
How are most of
the towns out there?
Let's just say
I haven't seen
anything like this
since we entered the CZ.
"CZ"?
Contamination Zone.
You're in CZ-12,
and you're better
off than most.
That's hard to imagine.
Try taking a walk through what's
left of Lawrence, Kansas.
What's it like?
Buildings
are all gone.
People who are left are
fighting their neighbors
for food and water.
Makes you wonder if the
survivors are the lucky ones.
We need a transistor
for their radio.
Can we take
apart the jukebox?
Oh, you're going to take
my music?
Isn't there anything else
you can take apart?
You've got three
Spin Doctors albums on here.
Trust me, it's a public service.
Don't worry, there's an old
ham radio in City Hall.
Maybe we can take that apart.
- Thanks anyway.
- Bye.
Oh, hey, big guy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I think you have something
of mine.
Sweetie,
let's sit down on the couch.
Your dad and I have
some talking to do.
You go ahead, Sam.
Just play with
your coloring books.
This is what you want, right?
Among other things.
You been lying to me, Robert.
When did you fall back
in love with your wife?
It's okay.
You go back to your book.
Go ahead.
We tried to institute
rationing early on,
but it took some time
for people to accept
that we were really
on our own.
Looks like you did a better job
than most towns I've seen.
Town's lucky to have
a military man in charge.
Well, I guess we
made out all right.
With salt from my mine,
we've been able to do
some trading with nearby towns.
Your town seems
to have been blessed.
That said, uh...
I can't say you'll be
a priority on the list.
Um, uh...
Wait a minute... what list?
We got detachments all over Kansas
assessing each town's needs.
Relief is given
on an as needed basis.
Wait a second.
You're saying that because
we planned better than others
it will come against us?
We can make out for
a while longer if we have to.
That's easy for you to say.
You're not being held accountable.
Why don't you give me
that want list and, uh,
I'll see what I can do.
Try that one.
Perfect.
So you're really not going
to tell me what happened?
Doc says frostbite.
Doctor also say
who kicked your ass?
Someone ran us off the road.
Most of it's a blur.
Just, uh,
tried to stay alive, you know?
I do.
- So, the marines, huh?
- Yeah.
Is it everything you hoped for?
There are moments.
But when I signed up, I never
thought I'd be fighting Americans.
Good people forced
to do bad things.
That's got to be rough.
I'm sorry.
It's not your problem.
What?
Just, uh,
wondering why someone like you
would join the marines.
Someone like me?
I had an office job
until a few years ago,
but I got bored.
I wanted to see the world.
- Have you?
- I've seen Omaha.
- You?
- What, seen the world? Yeah.
Yeah, I just saw
all the wrong places.
Man,
you have this brooding,
bad-boy thing down to an art.
The video I was sent
before the attacks,
those people were not
holding you captive.
You were just...
what, you were playing me?
Me playing you?
We were living together.
I showed up here
and you have a family again.
It's okay.
It's just a...
a story, you know?
It's just a story we're telling.
Go back to your book.
You made me promises, Robert.
Who were the people in that video?
Is that who you're working for?
I was. Now,
I'm working for myself.
So why don't you
give me what I want,
and then this story
can have a happy ending.
What are you gonna do
in the Marines finally...
- cut you loose?
- I try not to think about it.
That means you have.
After everything I've seen...
I'd like to find a nice little town
and just settle in
for the duration.
I don't think those
exist anymore.
I just found out they do.
What about you?
You ever thought
about flying again?
Maybe for the military?
Sure. Safer than being
on the ground, right?
Not if you're a radio operator.
I'm the safest of all.
I get to ride in the tank.
But if you ride in the tank,
how'd the radio get shot?
What, you think a girl can't...
get out and kick some ass
every once in a while?
Who you trying to call
on that thing anyway?
Uh, division headquarters
in Dodge City.
That's about 200 miles away.
This thing's made it farther.
Of course, that was
before it took some rounds.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV,
this is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
This is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>
<I>We've been trying to raise you
on this frequency for days.
<I>Division needs the entire
fourth tank battalion RTB ASAP.
<I>Do you copy?
Aye, aye, sir.
<I>Make that most tricky-tick, Corporal.
Roger that,
Charlie Company Actual, out.
What's going on?
We just got ordered
back to Dodge City.
What are you going to do
with the package, Sarah?
Sell it.
And get as far away
from here as possible.
What happened to you?
The last few months,
I've learned two things.
Everybody has a price.
And everybody lies.
Sit still, Sam.
- Take your...
- Stay there
I was just having a conversation
with your husband...
about what's more
important to him...
His job...
or his family.
Why are you leaving ?
Because we were
ordered to.
Sorry, but I can't reveal
operational orders.
Army Corps of Engineers
will be through eventually.
Eventually?
How long?
Sir, listen, I'm sorry,
but I just don't know.
You ready to roll?
Good to go, Gunny.
But I don't know
about the tank.
Don't know if we have enough fuel
to make it back to Dodge City.
Leave it behind
if we have to.
We'll post Sigloch and Kent here
till we can make it back.
Sergeant, without armor we're
sitting ducks for those highwaymen.
We're marines. We'll make do.
I can get you fuel.
Not much, but enough
to get you back to Dodge.
Just give me an hour.
I'm listening.
Plus... whatever
supplies you need.
But I just need assurances that
Jericho will be taken care of.
There's three C-130s
full of Red Cross supplies
that are supposed to arrive
in Kansas in 12 days.
I guarantee you'll be
at the top of their list.
That's all I ask.
All right, people,
listen up!
We're going to stand
down for one hour.
When the relief effort comes,
are you guys coming with it?
No.
You're going have to flirt with
a whole new batch of grunts.
And the Corps of Engineers
are nowhere near
as cute as I am.
You should think about...
coming back when you get out.
What would I do here?
That's a question we're all
asking ourselves, but...
you're a good fit.
You know,
before all this started,
I might have agreed with you.
But, uh...
I won't make it back here.
Corporal Mullin!
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant.
Why is your gear
not loaded up?
- Uh...
- Don't answer that.
We're headed over
to the town hall.
The mayor wants
to express his appreciation.
Somebody needs to stay here.
You...
Youjust drew
the short straw.
Aye, Gunny.
I'm going to go get
the last of the supplies
from the sheriff's office.
Get the package.
You know I can't do that.
You think I'm going
to believe a word you say?
Come on. We can work this out.
You had your chance
to go with me.
Please!
Shut up!
You're losing something tonight.
I promise you that.
Only question is,
is it going to be something
with a heartbeat?
I'll get the package.
Please put that gun down.
Why don't you get
Allison down here, too?
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>
Do you copy?
Lima Charlie,
it's cold as hell out here.
Hello?
This is Jake Green.
Jake Green, this is an official
Marine channel.
Get off this...
Hello?
Hello. Are you taking fire?
Hey, Gunny!
It's just a little something
to remember us by.
This is too kind, Mr. Mayor,
but, uh, we really
should press on.
No, you can't take off
on an empty stomach.
Come on in, I got
a little surprise for you.
Just something to show our
gratitude. Come on.
I need you to grab some of
our guys from patrol
and do a sweep of the
area, all right? Take guns.
Are you kidding?
I mean, we got
the US Marines Corps here.
Something's wrong about all this.
Trust me.
Okay, okay. Well...
what am I looking for?
A guy with a radio for starters.
Check anywhere within
earshot of the fireworks.
All right, maybe it's
nothing. Just check.
- All right? Go!
- Okay.
I can't talk.
What?
It's good talking to you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Honored guests.
I was very hopeful
that former Sergeant Green
might like to
say a few words.
Ladies and gentlemen, um...
Marine Corps has a motto
"Semper fidelis"
Always faithful.
And I think it's very fitting
that in our darkest hour,
it was marines who came
to our rescue.
Never before
in our nation's history
has a motto been so tried...
...and so necessary.
Gunny, Marines,
semper fi.
So, Gunny,
the Fighting Fourth.
Seen more than
your share of action.
From Iwo to Iraq, if there's a war,
there's the fourth.
Semper fi.
Excuse us a second.
What is the matter?
What's going on?
Downstairs.
I just, uh...
I heard the fireworks
over the marines' radio,
and Dodge City
is 200 miles away.
- What?  - They've got somebody
on the edge of town
pretending
to be their headquarters.
I sent Stanley and a couple of
the guys to check it out.
Tell me I'm crazy.
If you are, so am I.
Nobody calls an NCO "sir,"
and a marine
would never say, "Hoo-ah."
That's an Army thing.
These guys
did both.
Marines are all
about detail.
Well, if they're not marines,
who are they?
People with enough firepower
to wipe us out.
And we gave them half
the town's supplies.
What do we do?
Well, we've got to tell Gray.
How do we get Gray alone?
He's right next to them.
We got to do something
about that tank.
That thing gets turned lose
on Main Street,
it'll be a
bloodbath.
Even if you get that tank, they'll still
have a room full of hostages.
She's right.
We better get back before
they start to wonder.
Try to get a message to Gray,
and I'll wait for Stanley.
I'll see what I can do
about the tank.
Hey.
How was Dodge City picking up
our fireworks?
We pick up pops and pings
all the time...
Don't lie to me!
<i>Hello? Anyone out there?</i>
Stanley, is that you?
Jake, we found this guy
camping out here
with this radio.
Says he's with the marines.
I'm going to bring him back.
Is any of this real?
The gun's real.
I'm sorry.
You con people out
of stale food
and enough fuel to get
to the next town?
You don't know how bad
it is out there.
Yeah, I do.
Where'd you get all this?
There was a food riot
in our refugee camp.
A dozen marines
never had a chance
against 10,000 starving people.
So you killed them?
They retreated
and we took what they left.
Tried to get some food
in the next town.
It worked so well,
we kept doing it.
Don't.
You're not leaving town
with those supplies.
Don't get yourself killed
doing something stupid, Jake.
I don't want that
on my conscience.
You don't have it in you.
Open it.
Step... back.
My God.
- This has been here the whole time?
- It is not armed,
and the lead blocks
all the radiation...
- You brought that into our house?!
- D...
We were almost out of here,
and you told him, Maggie?
He figured it out.
He heard the fireworks
on the radio.
- So what do we do with him now?
- What do you mean?
Let's just leave.
And what...
wait for him to tell the whole town
when we're half a mile out?
It'll be Greenville
all over again.
We're not killers.
I was a P. E. teacher
who saw too many movies.
Now I'm a marine.
I'm adapting.
- No.
- It's him or us.
I vote for you.
You know, ammunition
being in such short supply,
I doubt those weapons
are even loaded.
You want to take that chance?
I know damn well this one is.
Son of a... bitch!
Get your hands up!
Get them up!
Get up.
How dare you wear
that uniform!
It's not a uniform...
it's a costume.
Half the towns we go through
don't even fly the flag.
Wait. Everything you said
about the war, North Korea,
it was all a lie?
Some of it we heard,
some we made up.
It's anybody's guess what's really
going on out there.
Well, we still have laws
in Jericho,
and tomorrow I'm going to let the town
decide what to do with you.
We can't do that, Gray.
The hell we can't!
People need to know
what we're up against.
Not like this.
Well, they're going to find out
eventually.
Yeah, they will.
And by then, the worst
of it will be over.
But food's not enough.
You said it yourself.
Without some "X" factor,
we don't make it through the winter.
Well, this is it.
People need faith
just as much as they need food.
And what the hell
do we do with them?
Then we give a hero's exit.
Ooh-rah.
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?
I won't follow you.
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.
My God.
I'll leave him
just outside of town.
No!
- Dad!
- Allie, get them out of here!
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.
- I'm sorry.
- Dad...
I'm fine.
Let me take this.
You are not fine.
Robert, we are not fine!
How long till-till
more people come after you?
Huh, after us?
- Come on, D, we're safe here.
- Don't...!
We'll never be safe with you.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, baby girl.
Move out! Let's go!
Our own personal escort
out of town?
Look, you're a smart girl,
you need to get out
before these guys get you killed.
And go where?
Towns aren't taking refugees,
and there's only one thing
they want women for.
Stay here... all right,
you'll be safe.
It's not going to work.
Not after the story we told.
Not now, Mimi.
Like hell not now, Cornhusker.
Cornhuskers are from Nebraska.
I'm a Jayhawk.
What? What?
You drive me so crazy,
and you know that
I can't stay here forever, but...
the truth is...
I can't live without you, either.
Really?
Yes, really.
We got enough food to get all of you
a few days down the road.
Hey, how about some water, man?
Make do.
You'll leave your weapons
on the tank,
and you will move out.
Do it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Be careful.
What do we do?
We soldier on.
What do we do with that?
Got room in your barn?
Seriously?
Why not.
Never know when
you might need a tank.

<i>Previously on Jericho</i>
Some of them were on planes
that landed in
the middle of nowhere.
They've been walking for weeks.
They must have gone
through hell.
Oh, my God.
Roger.
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that
Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team
sold us all out.
You're smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.
At current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.
We can live without
power for now,
but we won't see spring
if we don't eat.
All right, look,
the further out you get,
the hairier the roads are,
and food being
as scarce as it is,
there's bound to be
trouble out there.
Why are they following us?
Stanley, hold on!
Jake!
It's Mom and Dad, honey!
You're going to be all right.
So, I'm being watched?
It's the Old Man.
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.
If they kill me,
they will never find the package.
I have something
in my possession,
and there's people
out there that want it.
And that puts you, me
and the kids in danger here.
Then listen to me...
Sarah is not on our side.
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.
He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
- Why are you stalling on this one?
Because this one is different.
You won't make it out of Kansas
with the fuel you've got,
and you're not going to find
another drop out there.
The folks who left last week
are probably in Arizona by now.
If they weren't
murdered on the highway.
It is suicide to leave, Ridley.
There's no food, no heat.
It's suicide if we stay.
This... this is everything.
I mean, it's every farm.
At least until the spring crops come in,
and that could take months.
And what if we don't
factor in the refugees?
They're a part of this town now.
A lot of extra mouths to feed.
They've done their part, Gray.
They've helped hunt,
cut firewood...
Resources they use up five times
faster than they supply them.
When the windmills come in
from New Bern,
most of our fuel issues
will be solved.
What about every day until then?
Ridley and his group
are about to leave.
If people want to try and make it
on their own, that's their right.
You know as well as I do that
come springtime,
we'll find their bodies out there.
Well, what do you want me to do,
Johnston?
Wh-What am I missing
that's not on that board?
You find it for me,
'cause I don't see it.
Without some "X" factor,
we're not going to make it
through the winter.
Not all of us.
We have to make
some hard decisions.
And I think the last ones in
should be the first ones to go.
Clear the streets!
We need to clear the streets!
Who's in charge here?
I'm Gray Anderson.
I'm the mayor of Jericho.
Glad to meet you,
Mayor Anderson.
I'm Gunnery Sergeant Hill.
Fourth MAR-DIV,
Fourth Tank Battalion,
Charlie Company.
So you're...?
Sir,
we're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.

They sent the marines?
We were deployed to Western Kansas
to set up a firm base
and prep the outlying towns for the
arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Now that we've won the war,
it's time to start rebuilding.
War? What war?
- You didn't hear?
- No.
We lost all communications
after the EMP.
Well, we nuked the hell
out of North Korea and Iran.
So they were behind it?
From what I hear, which isn't much,
Iran financed it,
North Korea supplied the bombs.
We've got troops all over the world
going after the...
terrorists who snuck them in,
but at least we took
out the big dogs.
What happens now?
Largest reconstruction effort
in the history of the country.
So there's somebody
finally in charge?
The former secretary of HHS
is now the president.
We heard there
were six guys
from six different capitals
claiming to be president.
Resolved.
The federal government
is reunifying in Columbus, Ohio.
How did they
decide on Columbus?
All I know is, my orders are coming
from the commanding officer
of the Fourth Battalion,
and
those are to restore lights,
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.
W- Wait, wait.
When is that going to happen?
Should have your shelves full of Oreos
and Hot Pockets by the end of the year.
Welcome back to the grid, Jericho.
Thank God for
the US Marines.
Hey! Hey! It's over.
There are kids out here.
Get a room.
Come on. We should have been
on the road yesterday.
Well, I'm packed.
Hi. We're all fueled up.
How are we doing?
We'll be ready when we're ready.
I'll get the rest of my things
from downstairs.
How many more times
are we going to have to move?
- This should do it.
- Really?
You're going to stay in
one place from now on?
Sergeant Green. Marine Corps?
Ah, hell, no.
Army Rangers.
Well, I'll try not to hold it
against you.
Listen, Gunny, how long
before the engineers get here?
Could be two days,
could be two weeks.
In the meantime, why don't you get
a wish list of what you need,
and I'll forward that on to Battalion
Headquarters in Dodge City,
and we'll start to get y'all back on
your feet.  - Roger that.
Just tell me how
I can be of service.
Going to need
a command post.
- Use the sheriff's office.
- Great.
Excuse me.
If you guys are going
to be here for a while,
why don't I take your men
over to my tavern.
Thanks, ma'am,
my troops could use it.
Wymore!
Front and center!
Move it, move it!
Muster up and follow
this young lady here.
The liberty call is
sounded, but remember...
conduct yourselves like marines.
- Aye Sir.
Don't you "sir" me, PFC.
I work for a living.
Dismissed!
Aye, aye, Gunnery Sergeant.
Couple of months ago, I would have had
that kid doing push-ups till he puked,
but, uh, they've
been through a lot.
I understand.
Anything else we can do?
Well, Sergeant, uh...
one other thing.
Corporal Mullin!
Hi. Uh, I'm looking to scavenge
some replacement parts.
Our radio, well, it took
a couple of pretty good hits.
Do you have any idea
where I could start?
Maybe I could help.
Oh, Lance Corporal Mullin.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
So you're the town's
electronics expert?
No, I'm not an expert
at anything.
- But I can improvise.
- I'll take that.
We'll see what
we can find.
So, uh...
I've been thinking...
Maybe leaving my family...
isn't such a good idea.
What?
Why?
We've been over this.
They-they're not safe
here with you.
I know.
There are people out there
who would...
hurt them in order to get to me.
But at least I understand
the dangers.
I can protect them.
You're not thinking straight.
This is my family, Sarah.
It never mattered before.
Now it does.
What's it going to take...
someone slitting your wife's throat
before you get it ?
You're right.
We will drop them
at the safe house,
and then we'll keep moving.
It's the right thing for them.
I just realized...
Hmm?
If the government
is up and running,
you know what that means, right?
- No
Paperwork.
They'll need
accountants again.
Does that mean I'm back in debt?
Don't be so negative.
New York made it.
Come next summer,
I'll be taking walks
though Central Park.
What?
Dude!
This is awesome!
I could totally
be a marine.
I could totally see that happening...
Except for everything about you.
God, I...
Don't worry about her.
It's a phase, trust me.
The minute everything
calms down,
he's as good as gone.
Yeah, yeah, maybe
you can give him a ride
out of town
on the way to New York.
Thinking about leaving
this town is not
the same thing as thinking
about leaving you.
No?
Well, it adds up to
the same thing, Mimi.
Maybe you could
come with me.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.
That's not my life.
Well, this isn't mine.
I've missed you.
Me, too.
We should get going.
Start loading up
the truck, huh?
Go on, get out of here.
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm better than the truck.
Be able to quit worrying about you
one of these days, right?
Hey, Jake.
Amazing, huh?
Yeah, it's great news.
I'll see you later.
How are most of
the towns out there?
Let's just say
I haven't seen
anything like this
since we entered the CZ.
"CZ"?
Contamination Zone.
You're in CZ-12,
and you're better
off than most.
That's hard to imagine.
Try taking a walk through what's
left of Lawrence, Kansas.
What's it like?
Buildings
are all gone.
People who are left are
fighting their neighbors
for food and water.
Makes you wonder if the
survivors are the lucky ones.
We need a transistor
for their radio.
Can we take
apart the jukebox?
Oh, you're going to take
my music?
Isn't there anything else
you can take apart?
You've got three
Spin Doctors albums on here.
Trust me, it's a public service.
Don't worry, there's an old
ham radio in City Hall.
Maybe we can take that apart.
- Thanks anyway.
- Bye.
Oh, hey, big guy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I think you have something
of mine.
Sweetie,
let's sit down on the couch.
Your dad and I have
some talking to do.
You go ahead, Sam.
Just play with
your coloring books.
This is what you want, right?
Among other things.
You been lying to me, Robert.
When did you fall back
in love with your wife?
It's okay.
You go back to your book.
Go ahead.
We tried to institute
rationing early on,
but it took some time
for people to accept
that we were really
on our own.
Looks like you did a better job
than most towns I've seen.
Town's lucky to have
a military man in charge.
Well, I guess we
made out all right.
With salt from my mine,
we've been able to do
some trading with nearby towns.
Your town seems
to have been blessed.
That said, uh...
I can't say you'll be
a priority on the list.
Um, uh...
Wait a minute... what list?
We got detachments all over Kansas
assessing each town's needs.
Relief is given
on an as needed basis.
Wait a second.
You're saying that because
we planned better than others
it will come against us?
We can make out for
a while longer if we have to.
That's easy for you to say.
You're not being held accountable.
Why don't you give me
that want list and, uh,
I'll see what I can do.
Try that one.
Perfect.
So you're really not going
to tell me what happened?
Doc says frostbite.
Doctor also say
who kicked your ass?
Someone ran us off the road.
Most of it's a blur.
Just, uh,
tried to stay alive, you know?
I do.
- So, the marines, huh?
- Yeah.
Is it everything you hoped for?
There are moments.
But when I signed up, I never
thought I'd be fighting Americans.
Good people forced
to do bad things.
That's got to be rough.
I'm sorry.
It's not your problem.
What?
Just, uh,
wondering why someone like you
would join the marines.
Someone like me?
I had an office job
until a few years ago,
but I got bored.
I wanted to see the world.
- Have you?
- I've seen Omaha.
- You?
- What, seen the world? Yeah.
Yeah, I just saw
all the wrong places.
Man,
you have this brooding,
bad-boy thing down to an art.
The video I was sent
before the attacks,
those people were not
holding you captive.
You were just...
what, you were playing me?
Me playing you?
We were living together.
I showed up here
and you have a family again.
It's okay.
It's just a...
a story, you know?
It's just a story we're telling.
Go back to your book.
You made me promises, Robert.
Who were the people in that video?
Is that who you're working for?
I was. Now,
I'm working for myself.
So why don't you
give me what I want,
and then this story
can have a happy ending.
What are you gonna do
in the Marines finally...
- cut you loose?
- I try not to think about it.
That means you have.
After everything I've seen...
I'd like to find a nice little town
and just settle in
for the duration.
I don't think those
exist anymore.
I just found out they do.
What about you?
You ever thought
about flying again?
Maybe for the military?
Sure. Safer than being
on the ground, right?
Not if you're a radio operator.
I'm the safest of all.
I get to ride in the tank.
But if you ride in the tank,
how'd the radio get shot?
What, you think a girl can't...
get out and kick some ass
every once in a while?
Who you trying to call
on that thing anyway?
Uh, division headquarters
in Dodge City.
That's about 200 miles away.
This thing's made it farther.
Of course, that was
before it took some rounds.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV,
this is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
This is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>
<I>We've been trying to raise you
on this frequency for days.
<I>Division needs the entire
fourth tank battalion RTB ASAP.
<I>Do you copy?
Aye, aye, sir.
<I>Make that most tricky-tick, Corporal.
Roger that,
Charlie Company Actual, out.
What's going on?
We just got ordered
back to Dodge City.
What are you going to do
with the package, Sarah?
Sell it.
And get as far away
from here as possible.
What happened to you?
The last few months,
I've learned two things.
Everybody has a price.
And everybody lies.
Sit still, Sam.
- Take your...
- Stay there
I was just having a conversation
with your husband...
about what's more
important to him...
His job...
or his family.
Why are you leaving ?
Because we were
ordered to.
Sorry, but I can't reveal
operational orders.
Army Corps of Engineers
will be through eventually.
Eventually?
How long?
Sir, listen, I'm sorry,
but I just don't know.
You ready to roll?
Good to go, Gunny.
But I don't know
about the tank.
Don't know if we have enough fuel
to make it back to Dodge City.
Leave it behind
if we have to.
We'll post Sigloch and Kent here
till we can make it back.
Sergeant, without armor we're
sitting ducks for those highwaymen.
We're marines. We'll make do.
I can get you fuel.
Not much, but enough
to get you back to Dodge.
Just give me an hour.
I'm listening.
Plus... whatever
supplies you need.
But I just need assurances that
Jericho will be taken care of.
There's three C-130s
full of Red Cross supplies
that are supposed to arrive
in Kansas in 12 days.
I guarantee you'll be
at the top of their list.
That's all I ask.
All right, people,
listen up!
We're going to stand
down for one hour.
When the relief effort comes,
are you guys coming with it?
No.
You're going have to flirt with
a whole new batch of grunts.
And the Corps of Engineers
are nowhere near
as cute as I am.
You should think about...
coming back when you get out.
What would I do here?
That's a question we're all
asking ourselves, but...
you're a good fit.
You know,
before all this started,
I might have agreed with you.
But, uh...
I won't make it back here.
Corporal Mullin!
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant.
Why is your gear
not loaded up?
- Uh...
- Don't answer that.
We're headed over
to the town hall.
The mayor wants
to express his appreciation.
Somebody needs to stay here.
You...
Youjust drew
the short straw.
Aye, Gunny.
I'm going to go get
the last of the supplies
from the sheriff's office.
Get the package.
You know I can't do that.
You think I'm going
to believe a word you say?
Come on. We can work this out.
You had your chance
to go with me.
Please!
Shut up!
You're losing something tonight.
I promise you that.
Only question is,
is it going to be something
with a heartbeat?
I'll get the package.
Please put that gun down.
Why don't you get
Allison down here, too?
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>
Do you copy?
Lima Charlie,
it's cold as hell out here.
Hello?
This is Jake Green.
Jake Green, this is an official
Marine channel.
Get off this...
Hello?
Hello. Are you taking fire?
Hey, Gunny!
It's just a little something
to remember us by.
This is too kind, Mr. Mayor,
but, uh, we really
should press on.
No, you can't take off
on an empty stomach.
Come on in, I got
a little surprise for you.
Just something to show our
gratitude. Come on.
I need you to grab some of
our guys from patrol
and do a sweep of the
area, all right? Take guns.
Are you kidding?
I mean, we got
the US Marines Corps here.
Something's wrong about all this.
Trust me.
Okay, okay. Well...
what am I looking for?
A guy with a radio for starters.
Check anywhere within
earshot of the fireworks.
All right, maybe it's
nothing. Just check.
- All right? Go!
- Okay.
I can't talk.
What?
It's good talking to you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Honored guests.
I was very hopeful
that former Sergeant Green
might like to
say a few words.
Ladies and gentlemen, um...
Marine Corps has a motto
"Semper fidelis"
Always faithful.
And I think it's very fitting
that in our darkest hour,
it was marines who came
to our rescue.
Never before
in our nation's history
has a motto been so tried...
...and so necessary.
Gunny, Marines,
semper fi.
So, Gunny,
the Fighting Fourth.
Seen more than
your share of action.
From Iwo to Iraq, if there's a war,
there's the fourth.
Semper fi.
Excuse us a second.
What is the matter?
What's going on?
Downstairs.
I just, uh...
I heard the fireworks
over the marines' radio,
and Dodge City
is 200 miles away.
- What?  - They've got somebody
on the edge of town
pretending
to be their headquarters.
I sent Stanley and a couple of
the guys to check it out.
Tell me I'm crazy.
If you are, so am I.
Nobody calls an NCO "sir,"
and a marine
would never say, "Hoo-ah."
That's an Army thing.
These guys
did both.
Marines are all
about detail.
Well, if they're not marines,
who are they?
People with enough firepower
to wipe us out.
And we gave them half
the town's supplies.
What do we do?
Well, we've got to tell Gray.
How do we get Gray alone?
He's right next to them.
We got to do something
about that tank.
That thing gets turned lose
on Main Street,
it'll be a
bloodbath.
Even if you get that tank, they'll still
have a room full of hostages.
She's right.
We better get back before
they start to wonder.
Try to get a message to Gray,
and I'll wait for Stanley.
I'll see what I can do
about the tank.
Hey.
How was Dodge City picking up
our fireworks?
We pick up pops and pings
all the time...
Don't lie to me!
<i>Hello? Anyone out there?</i>
Stanley, is that you?
Jake, we found this guy
camping out here
with this radio.
Says he's with the marines.
I'm going to bring him back.
Is any of this real?
The gun's real.
I'm sorry.
You con people out
of stale food
and enough fuel to get
to the next town?
You don't know how bad
it is out there.
Yeah, I do.
Where'd you get all this?
There was a food riot
in our refugee camp.
A dozen marines
never had a chance
against 10,000 starving people.
So you killed them?
They retreated
and we took what they left.
Tried to get some food
in the next town.
It worked so well,
we kept doing it.
Don't.
You're not leaving town
with those supplies.
Don't get yourself killed
doing something stupid, Jake.
I don't want that
on my conscience.
You don't have it in you.
Open it.
Step... back.
My God.
- This has been here the whole time?
- It is not armed,
and the lead blocks
all the radiation...
- You brought that into our house?!
- D...
We were almost out of here,
and you told him, Maggie?
He figured it out.
He heard the fireworks
on the radio.
- So what do we do with him now?
- What do you mean?
Let's just leave.
And what...
wait for him to tell the whole town
when we're half a mile out?
It'll be Greenville
all over again.
We're not killers.
I was a P. E. teacher
who saw too many movies.
Now I'm a marine.
I'm adapting.
- No.
- It's him or us.
I vote for you.
You know, ammunition
being in such short supply,
I doubt those weapons
are even loaded.
You want to take that chance?
I know damn well this one is.
Son of a... bitch!
Get your hands up!
Get them up!
Get up.
How dare you wear
that uniform!
It's not a uniform...
it's a costume.
Half the towns we go through
don't even fly the flag.
Wait. Everything you said
about the war, North Korea,
it was all a lie?
Some of it we heard,
some we made up.
It's anybody's guess what's really
going on out there.
Well, we still have laws
in Jericho,
and tomorrow I'm going to let the town
decide what to do with you.
We can't do that, Gray.
The hell we can't!
People need to know
what we're up against.
Not like this.
Well, they're going to find out
eventually.
Yeah, they will.
And by then, the worst
of it will be over.
But food's not enough.
You said it yourself.
Without some "X" factor,
we don't make it through the winter.
Well, this is it.
People need faith
just as much as they need food.
And what the hell
do we do with them?
Then we give a hero's exit.
Ooh-rah.
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?
I won't follow you.
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.
My God.
I'll leave him
just outside of town.
No!
- Dad!
- Allie, get them out of here!
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.
- I'm sorry.
- Dad...
I'm fine.
Let me take this.
You are not fine.
Robert, we are not fine!
How long till-till
more people come after you?
Huh, after us?
- Come on, D, we're safe here.
- Don't...!
We'll never be safe with you.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, baby girl.
Move out! Let's go!
Our own personal escort
out of town?
Look, you're a smart girl,
you need to get out
before these guys get you killed.
And go where?
Towns aren't taking refugees,
and there's only one thing
they want women for.
Stay here... all right,
you'll be safe.
It's not going to work.
Not after the story we told.
Not now, Mimi.
Like hell not now, Cornhusker.
Cornhuskers are from Nebraska.
I'm a Jayhawk.
What? What?
You drive me so crazy,
and you know that
I can't stay here forever, but...
the truth is...
I can't live without you, either.
Really?
Yes, really.
We got enough food to get all of you
a few days down the road.
Hey, how about some water, man?
Make do.
You'll leave your weapons
on the tank,
and you will move out.
Do it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Be careful.
What do we do?
We soldier on.
What do we do with that?
Got room in your barn?
Seriously?
Why not.
Never know when
you might need a tank.

<i>Previously on </i>Jericho
When were you planning
on telling me about the baby?
A bad marriage doesn't get better
because you add a kid.
I didn't want you to stay with me
because of the baby, Eric.
Heather!
My God.
Uh... Jake, this is Ted Lewis.
We grew up together
over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.
I'm going to help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.
- Just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.
I have something
in my possession
and it puts you, me and the kids
in danger here.
Sarah is not on our side.
She's not here to help us.
Hawkins is starting
to put the pieces together.
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
Why are you stalling on this one?
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?
I won't follow you.
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.
Honey, you look tired.
You getting enough sleep?
Almost seven hours.
- Where?
- In my office.
Sleeping in your office
doesn't count.
You're going to give
the baby a crick in its neck.
You're going to make
a terrific grandmother.
- I know.
- You're Dr. Green? - Yes.
Jessica Williams.
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Ostrowski says
he's having chest pains.
He doesn't want anybody
to look at him but you.
Are you the doctor
who came in with the refugees?
Close. Third-year med student,
University of Chicago.
And I prefer
"visitor" to "refugee."
I'm sorry.
Thanks for the help.
Don't thank me.
I'm just working here
'cause I get to sleep in a bed
instead of the church basement.
Where do I start?
Pneumonia,
malnutrition, hypothermia.
Just grab a chart
and pick a patient.
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Hey, Jim.
Hope I didn't wake the kids.
No, you're okay.
Mine are the same way.
Up at all hours.
Worse when we had TV.
Is there something
I can do for you, Jim?
Sorry. Um...
Mayor Anderson wants me
to keep track of the refugees.
You know,
find out where they end up.
See what kind of work
they're doing to help the town.
Sarah Mason.
She's been...
staying with you, right?
Mr. Hawkins...
It's freezing out here. Uh...
Is she around?
- Oh, the generator's back on.
- Thank God.
Well, that's it.
We're on our last tank of diesel.
Power's out to everything
but the medical center.
Our last tank?
How long will we have power?
Ten, maybe 12 hours,
so turn off anything
you're not using.
What about the biodiesel?
We burned through it.
We're not going
to have any more for days.
We need to come up
with another plan.
We're getting more and
more people in here every...
Oh, God!
April, can you hear me?
Is she breathing?
April, wake up!
Get over here!

It's colder than a witch's patootie.
Using candles.
I saw you had some electric lights on
when I was walking up.
I got a geni
in the basement, but, uh...
I just used the last of my gas.
What were you doing?
I'm putting some stuff
in storage, but, uh...
I was just cleaning up.
Using the last of your fuel
on housework, huh?
Darcy's trained you well.
Listen, Jimmy, um...
I was just about to turn in, so...
Right. Sorry.
Uh, well, like I said,
Mayor Anderson's got me keeping
tabs on the refugees, you know.
Crime's up.
So, Sarah Mason.
Is she here?
Can I ask her some questions?
You know, um...
Sarah left yesterday.
Something about, uh...
family in New Orleans.
Wow. In this weather?
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.
Hey, don't worry about it.
You know, that's a...
nasty- looking cut
you got there.
Uh, yeah, it was, uh...
tree branch when
I was cutting wood.
- Must have been a real bleeder.
- Hey, it's not too deep.
Well, you be careful.
It's dangerous out there.
Again, sorry to bother you.
Yes.
I don't feel good.
I'm so tired all of a sudden.
I know.
I told you you need
to get some rest.
Here's your big chance.
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you, honey.
I'm trying to keep her calm,
but my gut tells me
the baby's having a problem,
and if I know it, she knows it.
- What are we going to do?
- Get Kenchy?
There's another doctor in town?
The man can barely
sit up on his bar stool.
Look, what I really need is
an ultrasound machine.
Without it, there's no real way
to know what's going on.
Well, maybe we have one that
survived the EMP in the basement.
- I'll go look.
- Good.
You go get your father
and tell him to find Eric.
He's the one who should be here.
It's the guys from New Bern.
They actually built the thing.
I can't believe it.
Hey, Russell.
- Hey. Sheriff, good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Johnston, you SOB.
- How the hell did you lose an election?
- No, the question is,
how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Well, this is our new mayor.
This is Gray Anderson.
- Mayor Anderson.
- Nice to meet you.
Congratulations.
Thank you. Thank you.
So, this is the windmill, huh?
It's a power-generating wind turbine.
We get about 1,500 watts an hour
out of one of these.
- Have you seen Eric?
- No, did you try Mary's?
Yeah. I tried there.
I tried at Bailey's.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably some time tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
I think we're going to need it
at the medical center.
- You got it.
- There's something wrong with April.
What? What is it?
She passed out. They think
there's a problem with the baby.
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
I'll walk.
Stanley thinks that you're using
this whole volunteering thing
as an excuse
to see Sean Henthorn.
I'm just following orders
to keep an eye on you.
Personally, I don't give
a damn who you date.
I've been volunteering here
since I was 16.
It's not about Sean.
You volunteer for anything? Ever?
Mr. Fredrickson.
Come on, stop.
Gracie gave you beet seed
in exchange for 3% of your farm crop.
That 3% is mine now.
The store was left to me.
I can't do that, Dale.
Things have gotten worse now.
I need it for my family,
to feed the last of my livestock.
I'm sorry.
It's the law, Mr. Fredrickson.
It's rightfully mine.
There are no more laws, son.
No.
I volunteered.
So. What do I do?
Empty. Clean. Repeat.
Where the hell is Eric?
Nobody knows.
Dad's getting Bill on it.
Her blood pressure's dropping.
- I'm feeling contractions.
- I think she's going into labor.
No, no, I can't.
The baby's only 16 weeks.
I need, I need ritodrine
to stop the labor.
I already checked.
We don't have any more.
I'll try to find some nifedipine.
All right, now what are you feeling?
If I lose consciousness,
and you can't find any medicine,
use alcohol.
What do you mean?
What kind of alcohol?
Anything coming out of the still.
Give me a 10% drip.
It'll stop the contractions.
Oh, God, she's bleeding.
Get Kenchy. Now!
I'm so cold my mouth is numb.
We need the logs or we're
going to freeze to death.
Isn't that what we're doing now?
All right. Let's get in the car.
Blanket.
Let's turn on the heat.
We can't. I'm sorry.
We won't have enough gas to get home.
You know, we could make our own heat.
Don't get any ideas...
I'm not taking my clothes off.
You know how happy you make me.
I'm still not taking my clothes off.
Come on!
What's her pressure?
- You smell like a wino.
- Nice to meet you too.
- What's her pressure, please ?
- 80/44 and dropping.
- Is she dilated?
- Two centimeters.
Her contractions are six minutes apart.
I need an ultrasound.
I brought some old ones
up from the basement.
I'll go check on them now.
- Do we have fresh plasma?
- No.
I need you to find somebody...
- With O-negative blood.
- Yes.
And we need
a fetal heart monitor.
Do we have that?
No?
I need you to put these on
and monitor the baby's heart rate.
Here, put these in your ear.
I'll show you how to listen.
I'm deaf.
Madam?
I need you to put these in ears.
I need you to monitor
the baby's heart rate.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I will show you how.
Come on, let's go! Please!
Here we go. Put these on.
Listen right here.
Now, the higher one,
the fast one.
You hear that?
That's the baby's heart rate.
You count 15 seconds,
and then you multiply
that by four.
- To get the beats per minute.
- Perfect
now I will show you
how to take blood pressure
and pulse rate.
All right, let's get ready to lift it.
You want me to settle
a contract dispute?!
Mr. Fredrickson isn't giving
Dale his share.
You're kidding me, right?
I'm trying to get power restored.
I got home robberies all over town.
The refugees are threatening
to break into the food lockup.
Okay, we're going to go on three.
One...
two...
three.
There we go.
A little higher, a little higher.
Okay, easy
Got it.
Watch the rope.
There you go.
Keep it going.
Almost there.
You got enough on your side?
Keep it taut.
Good job, fellas.
How's the baby?
I don't know.
How close is this?
I don't know, hours, at least.
Did you find Eric?
No. Bill and the rangers
are out looking for him.
Can we buy some more of these things?
Yeah. Let's talk about it.
<i>Mr. Hawkins!</i>
<i>I'm back!</i>
<i>Mr. Hawkins, you around?</i>
Just a second!
You weren't answering
your front door, so I just...
You doing some yard work?
You need a hand?
No. No, thank you.
I was going to turn some compost.
Getting ready to plant
food for the spring.
That's a good idea.
Margaret's planting carrots inside.
They're a super-food,
you know...
like broccoli.
You need something, Jimmy?
Gray wants me to find out
what kind of resources
Sarah might've taken with her, you know?
Fuel, food. Did she...
drive out of town?
- She didn't drive.
Took a backpack.
Some food...
a tent.
Then just walked out into the cold, huh?
That's crazy.
Maybe Darcy knows something more.
No, I don't think so.
I just figured,
you know, women talk, and who knows
what the hell they say, right?
Is Darcy around?
Can I...
can I speak with her?
Darcy and I are having problems.
She's moved out.
Boy, that's tough.
A lot of people leaving you lately, huh?
I'm-I'm sorry.
That's insensitive. I...
I will get my coat.
I'll take you to her, Jimmy.
Really?
<i>Hey, how are your, uh,
communication skills?</i>
You know, 'cause that's really
what marriage is all about.
<i>Honesty, love.</i>
<i>I'd say it's 50-50.</i>
<i>Sort of like half and half, you know?</i>
Well, actually, more like thirds,
if you throw respect in there.
<i>But not equal thirds, 'cause honesty...</i>
<i>is more important than
the love and the respect.</i>
<i>I think.</i>
You got one of the only
salt mines around for 400 miles.
A year without salt, and New Bern
will be a ghost town.
What are we talking about,
a couple hundred pounds?
No, we need a lot more than that.
- We're going to need food.
- No food to spare.
Won't see another crop till spring.
Spring crop's what I'm talking about.
Ten wind turbines for,
let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.
Spring crop might not even
get us to next year.
If we lose ten percent, we'll just be
in the same position we are now.
Worse.
Look, all we're asking you
to do is be reasonable.
Well, we're just trying to survive.
Starve next fall or freeze
this winter...
take your pick.
Vancomycin... good.
Start a drip: 250 milligrams IV.
I'll do it.
We found four people who are O-negative.
- Fetal heart rate is 169.
- I'll get it off the ultrasound.
Her blood pressure is 130/70.
Her respiratory rate is 18,
and her pulse is 88, it's going up.
She's losing blood.
Her heart's compensating
by pumping harder.
Start an IV for the blood.
What do you see?
- Placenta previa.
- What's that?
The placenta is covering
the entire cervix.
There's no way for me to find out
where the bleed is coming from
unless we operate.
Well, what are we going to do?
Under the best of circumstances,
this is not an operating facility.
- Then we don't have a choice.
- Cannot operate here.
Why?
I have been through this more times
than you could possibly imagine.
We've all been through a lot, all right?
Just tell us...
I have seen
hundreds of people die
because of dirty facilities
and infection
and because I didn't have
the proper medicine
or the equipment
that I needed.
I am not doing it again.
We are not losing this baby.
You can find yourself another butcher.
There's got to be a way.
Kenchy. Listen,
we need a sterile operating room,
sterile instruments,
anesthesia, spinal block tray,
caesarian tray.
Have you ever even seen a surgery
performed without
an electrocautery machine?
No, you haven't. Because
this doesn't even taught anymore.
Can't we just use laparotomy
sponges to stop the bleeding?
God, my head is killing me.
We've got several spinal block trays,
and we've got anesthesia.
And we can boil
the sheets and the tools.
Is it possible?
- Remotely.
- Then start.
- We need bleach.
- What?
Bleach.
You know? Bleach.
Bonnie, look at my lips.
Bleach !
Learn.
- Is that the word for "bleach"?
- No.
"Bitch."
And... "please."
And "sorry."
I'm heading out.
If I'm not back, lock up at dark
and don't let anyone in.
Also, if I'm not around ever
and you need anything,
just talk to Gail Green or Johnston.
You can trust them.
I'm going to come with you.
Why?
Two against one.
Hey, Bill.
What's wrong?
I just jumped in.
It was...
It was just in the moment.
You volunteered at the medical center
long before I ever get here.
It's fine.
Kenchy just doesn't know you.
Everybody else respects you.
They speak your language.
- Hey, we got a problem.
- What's that?
Eddie and Frank are asking
how come you're not making the deal.
Words are gonna start to spread.
As far as they know,
the marines said that
the army corp of engineers would
be here within the month.
What difference does it make if we give
New Bern a part of next year's profit?
They think there's going
to be food by then.
You didn't want to tell them it was
a bunch of crap, so now what do we do?
All right,
maybe we should tell the town
that help's not coming.
We just told them that to give 'em
something to get through winter.
Town's already on the edge,
you'll have anarchy.
And I'm not leverage
next winter's food,
that'd be suicide.
What if we tell New Bern that
we'll give them
10% of next year's crop.
We get power now.
If next year we don't have
the food to give, we don't give it up.
That's how wars get started.
I can't believe Darcy is staying
at the refugee shelter.
Hey, Jim,
let me talk to her a second.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I asked you to stay away.
Jimmy wanted to ask you
some questions...
about Sarah.
Where are the kids?
They're in the gym, playing.
We need a consistent cover story.
What'd you do with her body?
I buried her.
So I can tell them that right now,
and never see you again.
I could tell him about...
- What did you call it... "the package"?
- Stop it!
You understand the story?
Family? New Orleans?
And you don't know
anything else about her.
This'll just take a sec.
Yeah, well, I don't want
to talk to you in front of him.
Why don't you give us
a minute, Mr. Hawkins?
I'll be out front...
let you two talk.
You're going to be okay, angel.
Did you ever do
a surgical rotation?
Only in school.
Most of my career was in post-op.
I feel obligated to ask you
if you're sober enough to do this.
You can talk me through it.
You will refer to me
as Dr. Dhuwalia, Nurse.
And my sobriety is not the issue.
The people I call "doctor"
don't smell like a brewery.
Respirations are 16.
Pulse rate is 82.
Her blood pressure's down to 100/62.
God help us.
- Is the baby okay?
- I don't know.
Mom said there's a problem.
We were just
collecting firewood.
You don't have
to explain it to me.
What about Mom?
Don't worry about that.
Shut the door.
We're losing too much blood.
Clamp it off.
Get away from the incision!
I need to hear
if the baby's in distress.
Get away from the incision.
You haven't let me get
a pulse from this baby in an hour.
Respirations are 16, pulse is 84.
Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.
You're not close enough to the fetus.
It's not an accurate measurement.
The placenta's grown into
the uterus wall. It's ripping away.
- That's what's causing the bleeding.
- Now I've lost it.
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?
The baby's heart beat has stopped.
- What do you mean, it's stopped?
- Do something.
That must be
the last of the diesel.
Open the door.
Open the blinds.
I need light.
Why aren't you doing
something about the baby?
This hasn't been about
the baby for several hours.
The baby never really had a chance.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you saying?
I am trying to save April.
- What do you want?
- Same thing as before.
- My share of the crop.
- I told you I can't do that. Go home.
I'm only asking for what's mine.
You said there's no law, right?
I'm not trying to cheat anybody.
I don't have that much left.
Then give my share
of whatever you got.
Right now.
- What's going on?
- I... I just...
need some space right now.
We lost the baby.
Oh, sweetie...
I need to be
with April right now.
What took you so long?
Well after...
talking with Darcy, uh...
a lot of things are starting
to make sense now.
You all right, Mr. Hawkins?
I'm fine.
Well, Darcy said...
that Sarah left for New Orleans,
just like you told me.
What? You think I was lying?
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.
She doesn't need
to be staying in the shelter.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
We found a body, Robert.
Out in the woods.
Near Mill Creek.
Broken neck.
Animals got to it.
Michael Connor was on patrol,
said he saw
an African-American woman
driving out that way
a couple nights ago.
Perfect description of Sarah Mason.
Really?
Think she could do
something like that?
I don't know.
You know,
I'm learning that, uh...
it's hard to figure what
people are capable of, Jimmy.
Well, our John Doe was bald.
Know anyone looks like that?
If Sarah comes back...
we'd really, really
like to talk to her.
My guess is...
she's not coming back.
That'd be my guess, too.
New Bern's all made of clay,
can't grow nothing.
We need 10% of your spring crop,
and 700 pounds refined salt.
Well, y-you said 500 earlier.
- Price went up.
- Why?
Because that's what
power costs in this world.
Oh, now, come on...
We got people freezing
to death in their homes.
Give us a break.
You were at my son's wedding.
I'm sorry for your troubles.
But we got our own.
We'll give you the food.
We'll give you the salt.
Everything.
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.
What guarantee do we have
you'll give us our share of the crop?
You have our word.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
We can take them
back with us now.
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?
Human beings as collateral?
I would never do that.
But I am not going
to build these things on credit.
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.
Just hold the pressure.
Put pressure right there.
Right there.
Press, harder!
Damn it! I can't see!
I- I'll get another lantern.
You can bring ten lanterns.
Doesn't make any difference.
It's not going to be enough.
I need real light!
Blood pressure is down to 66/30.
This is crazy.
This is crazy. Close her up.
But we haven't stopped
the bleeding.
- What are you doing?
- Give her some peace.
Give her some dignity.
You are not giving up on her.
I'm sorry.
Close this up.
Where do you think you're going?
You get back inside, right now!
- Come on!
- Take it easy.
Take it easy, all right?
Just let me handle this.
Let me handle it.
What are you doing?
You want me to say it
in front of him?
Go back inside, all right?
April needs you.
To go on operating
is cruel and pointless.
Don't even ask me, Jake.
I'm done with this.
I became a plastic surgeon
so I could have the simple, easy life
that other man face.
- Not in this town.
- I don't care.
I'm not going through this anymore.
It is madness.
And everyone here
can just go to hell?
If you stop trying, and I stop,
then they see that.
And this whole thing falls apart.
We're all leaning on each other here,
whether you like it or not.
Promise me
you are not saying
that we're all connected.
This is not some existential,
web-of-life BS.
That is not what I'm hearing,
is it, Jake?
Then tell me
what you want to hear.
'Cause I'll say anything,
if you'll just go back in there
and keep trying.
She's going to die.
I know.
Okay. New gloves.
Let's get this bleeding
stopped, shall we?
- Well, we've got more sponges.
- Excellent!
Pack them in others vascular bleeding.
Just give me time to suture.
He's going to need you.
Now.
Hold my hand.
I'm right here.
I'm right next to you.
I like the name Tracy.
Tracy's a beautiful name.
Thank you for not saying anything.
I didn't do it for you,
I did it for Allison.
I need my family to come home.
I, uh...
I need you.
You know, in the last
three months,
I remembered all the reasons
why I need you in my life.
So have I.
I've also remembered
why it can never work.
I need truth, Robert, and that's
something you've never given me.
- Everything I do, I do for us.
- Listen.
When you hide a part of yourself,
I don't care what the reason is...
it puts something between us.
Please.
My daughter just killed a woman.
I don't have any more trust to give you.
So, I got the kids with
Margaret back at the house.
What can I carry?
This.
Hang in there.
I got faith in you guys.
Sorry?
The wind turbine's working.
Mrs. Hodges, how are you doing?
- Not so hot.
- Let's get you checked out again.
Dr. Dhuwalia.
Mrs. Hodges' cough is worse.
Her temperature is 102.
- Hello, Mrs. Hodges.
- I'm Dr. Dhuwalia.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Why don't you go outside
and get a pan of boiling hot water
build a tent with a sheet. We need to
get this lady breathing some moist air.
Take a deep breath.
There we go.
That was incredible!
Did you see the look on his face?
I know, I thought he
was going to have a heart attack,
and we were going to have
to drive him to the medical center.
I think we're going to be okay.
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to be there...
with you.
<i>You men are the only ones
who really know what's going on here.</i>
When New Bern gets
their share of the spring crop,
you'll be allowed to return.
I know that sounds like a long time,
but what you are about to do
means this town's survival.
Now you've...
I know your families want some time
to say good-bye. So let's get going.
Promise me something...
Promise you won't kill
Mimi while I'm gone.
And you'll give her food.
Why do you have to go?
People are going to die if we
don't get these wind turbines...
You're all have.
I'll be back.
Take care of Bonnie, okay?
Look, I just want to tell you something.
- And don't freak out, okay?
- I won't.
In this...
crazy world we don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow and...
I don't wanna leave
anything unsaid, so...
I'm just going to say it, okay?
So here I go...
I've loved you since the
first day I saw you at Bailey's.
You said it... you said it first.
No one's ever said
it first to me before.
I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow, and...
Plus,
I can hold it over you
for the rest of our lives.
I love you, Stanley Richmond.
But I said it first.
It wasn't your fault, Eric.
You don't have to do this.
I can't be here right now.
I can't.
Take care, son.
Be strong.
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mom.
We'll take care of Mary.
All right, let's move out.
My dad told me what's happening.
First you're helping us, and now this...
What the hell's going on?
They're going to be fine.
I'm going to look after them.
- You have to trust me on this.
- Trust?
This isn't me.
Where's Heather?
She's fine. I told her we were making
the trip. She didn't want to come.
Truth.
If anything happens to any of them,
you're the first one I come for.
I know.
[ www.seriessub.com ]
<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Some of them were on planes
that landed in the middle of nowhere.
They've been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
Oh, my God.
At the current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that
Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team sold us all out.
You're smart enough to know
that they would say anything
to get you to talk, Sarah.
Get the package.
We're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.
... and those are to restore lights,
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.
Something's wrong about all this,
all right? Trust me.
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.
Is any of this real?
- The gun's real.
- Hands up. Get them up!
What the hell do we do with them?
You will leave your weapons on the tank,
and you will move out!
- What do we do with that?
- Stanley,
got room in your barn?
- Seriously?
- Why not?
Never know when you might need a tank.
You're making too much noise.
Sorry.
Where did it go?
There it is.
- It's locked.
- We shouldn't go in.
Go in here.
- Why do I have to?
- So we can eat.
You see it?
Katie?
<i>Come on, Jake,
there's a line here.
<i>Did you hear about the tank?
<i>Those Marines coming or what?
<i>Everybody, just calm down!
You'll get your share.
<i>You'll get your rations!
<i>People, please, back up!
How is Gray handling this?
You better get in there.
I think we really screwed
ourselves this time.
You said everyone in the shelter gets
half-rations until the Marines come.
Well, the Marines aren't coming,
and you've known all along.
We did the best that we could.
People had to believe
that help was on the way.
And you know what?
Half-rations is a lot more than
those refugees had before they got here.
Did you know about this?
The Marines...
That they were con artists?
Yeah, but we didn't give them
any of our supplies.
And Gray is right. The last thing
this town needs is to lose hope.
Hope won't keep
my friends from starving.
I've got one woman too weak to walk.
It's a mathematical problem.
We've got your friends,
plus another 50 who migrated here.
That's too many people,
and not enough food.
We'll just have to figure out
how to make what we have last.
I say the first thing we do,
is stop giving it away to strangers.
What if we cut
the food rations in half,
again?
It's more than the food.
What about medicine?
Those refugees came here sick.
They've been burning through
our meds for a month.
Can we make it to spring, Harry?
Some of us can. Not all.
Crime's been going up
since they got here.
Crime's been going up
since the bombs.
It's got to be done.
The numbers speak for themselves.
Just look at 'em.
I don't need to look at 'em.
I see them in my sleep.
What are you going to do?
Folks?
Folks, listen up!
I am sorry to say that
the town no longer has the resources
to take care of you.
<i>What?
Where are we supposed to go?
So if you could please
gather up your belongings,
you will be escorted
to a FEMA camp out
- near I-70.
- We've been to those FEMA camps.
We barely made it out
alive the first time.
FEMA has medicine and supplies,
and we don't.
You heard the mayor.
You need to start packing up.
What are you going to do,
put us in jail?
Great.
If I didn't have to do this,
- I wouldn't.
- We've been working!
Okay? We've been chopping wood!
Jessica's been helping you
with your medical center.
I'm sorry.
But if you put us out on the...
This isn't a debate.
You're right.
'Cause we're staying.

Anything?
Static.
No news.
I guess now the secret
about the tank is out,
there's no need to hide the radio.
Yeah. I'll take it down
to Bailey's later.
We can all be annoyed together.
Emily.
Gray's trying to kick out the refugees.
They barricaded themselves
inside the church.
Was anybody hurt?
Is there another door?
No. They blocked that one, too.
Look, Roger, I'm sorry, but...
You lie about the Marines,
you get caught, you need someone
to blame, so you pick them.
We have taken in almost
a hundred people since the bombs.
Roger, you brought over 50 yourself.
We've done our part.
It's time for somebody else
to share the burden.
- Now, these FEMA camps...
- Those FEMA camps are jungles.
Putting anybody out on those streets
is a death sentence.
You've been out there.
You know that.
Look, it comes down to ressources.
All right? And people of Jericho
have to come first.
It's 100 of them or 100 of us.
Let me work on Gray.
You and Emily try and talk
some sense into the refugees.
Don't give Gray
a reason to make this worse.
All right? Gray can't send
these people away like this.
It's his call.
Well, isn't there
something we can do?
Give them warm clothing for the trip.
We've given away
everything we can spare.
Well, there's...
What?
April's things?
Kyle, what are you doing?
We're not leaving here without a fight.
- This is a bad idea.
- What should we do?
We take down the barricade.
We go out unarmed.
We look them in the eye,
and we ask them to stay
till the end of winter.
Look them in the eye.
That's your plan?
- You don't know this town.
- Apparently, that makes two of us.
Where did you get the food from?
You stole it.
You broke into people's houses?
It's not like you didn't do the same
thing when we were out there.
Yeah, well, this is different.
This town took care of us!
We took care of us!
Because we knew,
one day, this town wouldn't.
What do you see?
Looks like Simmons has got
his nephew guarding the shed.
I don't think I can get in.
You have to.
You traded them for that gas,
and they're holding out on you.
You can't let these farmers
get away with it anymore.
It's easy for you to say.
I'll go this time.
Very funny.
What? You think you're
the only badass here?
- Uh... yeah.
- You want to bet?
Forget it, Skylar. Simmons is not
a pushover like Frederickson.
Neither am I.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You could get hurt.
You're worried about me?
That's so sweet.
Now, watch and learn.
Found them!
Tear gas?
Gray, those things been
sitting around for years.
You can't do this, Gray.
I've given these people sanctuary.
Reverend, this is a police matter now.
You have no right
to assault these people.
They've committed no crimes.
- They'll be my responsibility.
- What, are you going to feed them?
What, you got a little hospital
down there, Reverend?
No, I didn't think so.
What's that sound?
They're boarding up the windows.
There were half a dozen other places
we could have stopped,
but you kept talking like Jericho
was the end of the freakin' rainbow.
So we kept walking...
losing people... for this.
Out of my way, Johnston!
I know what I'm doing.
You know why we never used those?
A little thing called Waco happened.
The FBI used tear gas,
and they swear it didn't start
that fire, but it could have.
- You ready to live with that?
- Dad!
We can't hold off a town.
- It's too big a gamble.
- It's not a gamble for you!
You get to go home
to a warm bed every night.
I told you... I'm with you.
What happens when
we get kicked out of this town?
<i>Come on!
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!
<i>She's got no pulse.
Hank! Hank!
- Skylar!
- Thank God. There are men on the road!
- Men? What men?
- They're with Ravenwood.
Is your uncle here?
- No, it's just me.
- We have to hide!
Okay, yeah. Come on!
How many were there?
I don't know. Five, maybe six.
I can't see them.
You know what?
I bet you have
a better view from the hayloft.
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.
Skylar!
Stop!
It's okay. I'll wait.
One of the refugees is still out there.
You have the rangers search the barns.
Use dogs if it'll help.
And the rest of them?
Take them to the med center,
get them fixed up, Harry.
Then send them away.
What about the extra food
you promised them?
Give it to them.
- After what they did to us?
- Will you just do it,
before somebody else gets hurt?!
It's not too late.
Just let them stay until spring.
You think I haven't tried
to make that work?
The numbers don't add up.
- They're good people, Gray. Just...
- And?!
Good people are dying every day!
Someone finally has to tell the truth.
It's musical chairs out there.
The music has stopped!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, get away from me!
Get away from me!
A hundred counts of murder, Gray.
That's what they should charge you with
if you send them away.
We have been feeding them
and we have been heating the shelter.
We've been taking
from my friends
to give to strangers,
so don't you dare lecture me!
Whatever happens to them is on you!
Let me go, please!
- I don't want to hurt you!
- Just let me go, please!
You're not leaving
until this is resolved!
This is resolved!
Get out of my way!
- They're not going anywhere.
- You want to bet?
Just take whatever you want!
Just get out!
And go where?!
I got the entire police force
guarding the refugees,
and one way or another,
they're going.
Hey, stop it!
All right, stop it!
What's going on?
What happened?
Gray pulled a gun.
It was an accident.
Like hell! He shot me!
There's so much blood.
He needs a doctor.
- Get-get Kenchy.
- No, get Jessica.
Shut up!
You're not running things!
Get Jessica, please, all right?
I trust her.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
What are you looking for?
Superglue.
The sole on my boot came apart
after a couple hundred miles.
My son's shoes might fit you.
I'd rather fix these.
Why?
They're all I have left that are mine.
Where are you going to go?
I don't know really.
My family was in Chicago.
I wish there was more
that we could do.
Ma'am,
there are empty houses
all over Jericho,
and we sleep in a shelter.
Those are our neighbors' homes.
They were gone
when the bombs went off.
They're coming back.
Well, wherever your neighbors are,
I hope nobody's kicking them
out of town in the middle of winter.
What the hell happened in there?
- Gray's bleeding badly.
- I'm busy.
- I need your help!
- Get Kenchy.
Look, you're the only
one Roger trusts.
You want me to save
Gray Anderson?
If Gray dies, so does Roger.
People aren't just going
to let it go. Please?
We can all get out of this.
I was just trying to help them.
Now... there's no way the
town lets them stay.
It was an accident.
I saw it.
Gray...
just until spring.
That's all I ask.
Come on!
You were right.
This is on me.
I brought them here.
I did it...
I did it for my own reasons.
But don't punish them,
I'm begging you.
Just till spring.
Go to hell.
I've got Jessica. Let us in.
You need to let me look at him.
You give them a chance...
...I'll give you a chance.
I was going to give you
food, an escort.
We wouldn't survive out there...
you know that.
We have to stay here.
Why would you die over this?!
He's our only leverage.
Roger, this isn't you.
I survived out there
for three months.
You have no idea what
I can do if I have to.
- Any sign of her?
- No.
Check the buildings.
She's got to be around
here somewhere.
Hold up.
She changed the location again.
Meet you back at the road.
Bill, don't!
You think I want to?
Roger's a friend of mine, but I can't
let the mayor bleed to death.
What if you miss?
What if you hit Emily?
Get off me.
If I get the shot, Jake...
I'm taking it.
Damn it.
We have to get him help.
He didn't want to do this.
It doesn't matter what
we want, does it?
It matters what we do.
I tried to get us all back here.
I promised them if we
just stuck together.
- And you did.
- Yeah.
Emily, most of us made it back.
19 of us didn't.
What's going on?
And I remember...
every one of their faces.
- Get away from the window!
- Jake, what are you doing?!
- I told you to stay out!
- Get away from the window!
Get away from the window!
Roger, get away from
the window!
Roger, get away from
the window!
If you want your friends to live...
you better back the hell off
right now and listen to me!
Roger, he's here to help.
I'm listening.
What if we give you
transportation?
And food and fuel?
So we can die out there?
- Guy is that what you think about?
- No!
You can make it to
the migration trail.
Head south and beat the winter.
It's not your decision to make.
Won't be yours either if you're dead.
You can't keep us in here forever.
This will end.
And when it does,
you can forget about staying.
They will kick you out
with nothing.
I'm going to need guns.
I can't give you guns.
I can't protect a hundred
people with what I have.
But you let Jessica take Gray
to the medical center.
He's not leaving.
Roger, if that bullet is still in him,
I'm going to have to open him up.
Is it a deal?
You make sure everything's ready.
I'll let him go.
Hey, Allie.
Dad, you can't be around here.
Mom will freak out.
I won't stay long.
Come on.
So...
I just wanted to know
how you were doing.
Settling in okay at
Jimmy's place?
- Yeah, he just never stops talking.
- No...
He doesn't.
ow's Sam?
You know, he gets scared.
And you?
I'm fine.
Look...
that thing you had
to do to Sarah...
I know how that can
change people.
Dad...
don't worry about me.
I'm not Sam, and
I'm not Mom.
So...
you're not going to live with
us anymore... are you ?
I don't think it's a good
idea right now.
Then don't worry.
I'll take care of them.
Come here.
You are not me.
Thank you for helping me.
Just try to keep still.
It's my job, you know.
I didn't want to do it.
I had to.
We all have our jobs to do,
whether we want to do them or not.
Just hang on.
The bus is here.
When do you think you'll come back?
After this...
he's never going to
let me come back.
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought them here.
There were other places...
camps...
towns we heard about.
But I had to see you.
A refugee broke into the house.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'll get the guys.
Listen to me.
We can't let this happen.
We're ready.
Get up.
Wait, you can't take him.
Once my friends and I...
are safely out of town...
I'll let him go.
He'll be dead by then.
You can't let them go out there.
A woman died on Main Street today.
I didn't even know her name.
Did you?
If you need a hostage,
take me.
Think of our neighbors who
haven't made it back yet.
That's who they are.
Now my family can feed two people.
Now my family can feed two people.
Who else here is willing
to share their rations?
They're coming out!
All right, move back!
Move back!
Come on, people, we can do this.
I know we can, please.
Thank you, Bob. Yeah.
Right. Good.
Who else?
Come on, who else? Please.
Please.
Everybody, get back!
Get back!
Keep your guns down.
Keep them down.
Move back!
Move back!
- Move back!
- My God.
Roger...
it's over.
They can stay.
We found them homes.
Just put the gun down, Roger.
You won.
Come on, put it down.
How's the mayor?
Jessica did a great job.
He's, um...
he's lost a lot of blood,
but he's stable.
We talked him into letting
the others stay.
But, um...
Not me.
Well...
I'd say I'd call you, but...
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Roger, I-I am, so...
I did this
so the people I love
can be safe here.
I'm not taking the person I love
the most out on those roads.
I can handle it.
I can't.
So... what do you think?
Well, it's no Saks Fifth Avenue,
but...
it's pretty great.
Thanks to all the deals we made,
we have a real trading post now.
Hi, Mr. Simmons.
Hank.
- What?!
You think this is a joke?
I could've shot you.
Talk to your uncle, Hank.
He's the one that broke the deal.
You're just a real big man,
aren't you?
Just give me my horse
and the gas, and I'll be on my way.
The horse is tied up in the alley,
but the gas is mine.
I'm through playing
games with you.
Hank, get the gas.
Meet my new employees.
This is, um,
Jim and Judy Moore's house.
They were visiting their grandchildren
just outside of Philadelphia.
Rations are on Tuesday.
We'll be by to share them with you.
Mrs. Green.
Thank you.
We got together
some canned food and water.
I wish I had more.
Nothing I say is going to...
is going to sound right, so...
Are you really sad to see me go?
It's not about that.
Here.
Take Cedar Run first, it's clear,
and then head to New Bern.
Heather, Stanley, my brother,
they can help you
once you're there.
I know my way around.

Previously on <i>Jericho
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team
sold us all out.
You’re smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.
Get the package.
In the last three months,
I remembered
all the reasons...
why I needed you in my life.
So have I.
I've also remembered
why it can never work.
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
<i>We have also received reports
<i>that the bombers gained
the trust of local officials
<i>which allowed the terrorists
access to secure locations.
I’ve heard that voice before.
- That's the guy that does the
farm report.  - It’s real news.
<i>In New York, the terrorists
who were apprehended,
<i>were all carrying nearly perfect
fake FBI badges.
<i>- You're drunk.
- Yes, I am, Darcy.
<i>Yes, I am.
<i>What ?
What is it, Rob ?
Is all that really
worth it for 6 kids ?
Six kids in a conference room
is not Harvard, but it's a start.
I meant for you.
I think it's time we start trying
to get things back to normal.
To be honest with you,
if I'm a kid...
going to school isn't exactly high
on my list of priorities these days.
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, can I... borrow you for a few
minutes, I need your help.
I'm going to get you
a bat signal or something.
What's wrong ?
You remember, last week on the
radio broadcast, they said that
terrorists used fake FBI badges
to move through security ?
I've seen one of those badges.
Where ?
I never went to Law school,
but I'm going to go ahead and guess.
- This is breaking and entering.
- It's called probable cause.
It's called paranoďd
abuse of authority.
Come on, let's go... before he
comes home and catches you...
prying up his floorboards.
The terrorists had FBI badges...
Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge.
You think that's just coďncidence ?
Maybe he's FBI !
Please, tell me you thought of that.
I did...
and I asked his family.
And they all say he's FBI.
But... when they said it they all
had this look on their face like...
there was something that
they weren't saying.
Sort of like the look I've got
on my face right now.
Look, I had a hunch,
and I was right.
Now, he's out on patrol...
he's not going to be back
for a while, so...
Come on !
Did you bust this lock open ?
You know, this is kinda
weird, but...
if he's FBI, isn't this what
his basement would look like ?
That's... that's what I said...
until I saw this.
- Does Gray know about this ?
- No.
I wanted to get a second opinion
before I told anyone.
What do you want to do ?
Don't.
Who are you ?

Hand it over.
Nice and slow.
Slide it over.
What the hell are
you doing here ?
Did you wipe out 23
American cities ?
- Get out of my house.
- Answer the question !
- Why would you even think that ?
- You've got a working generator...
and a food supply.
So like you knew the
attacks were coming.
- I'm gonna give you 10 seconds...
- Back up !
Jimmy knows I'm here.
If I don't call him off
when he gets back...
you're gonna have a lot more
people than me to deal with.
I'm an FBI agent, Jake.
That's what I heard.
Problem is the radio was reporting
the terrorists used
forged FBI badges to get
their bombs into position.
What is that room ?
How were you involved
in all of this ?
I need to know.
5 months ago, this was
a map of our country.
Now, it's an antique.
It's a picture of the way
things used to be.
Right now...
all we're sure of is this.
But this is where we
start to rebuild.
So how do we do it ?
How ?
We look to our history.
We study the people
that came before us.
- Are you going to take attendance ?
- No.
Where are you going ?
My mom's at home right now...
trying to grow beets out of our
bathtub so we can eat newt month.
This stuff...
isn't important.
I guess school's out
early today.
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.
I don't think I should be hanging
around at home right now.
So, I guess I'm stuck here.
<i>So it's come to this...
I want you to know this has nothing
to do with you personnally, I'm...
sure you're...
wonderfull.
But let's be honest here, you're
the one that lays the fewest eggs
and I distinctly told all of you
that this was going to happen.
I believe I made myself perfectly
clear in that regard.
All right.
The thing is...
If you knew me at all,
you would...
see how really funny this is,
because this is so not my thing.
No... this is Stanley's thing.
It's just... I'm awfully hungry.
And... I don't want to get into the
whole circle of life business, but...
I just cannot eat anymore sprouts.
OK ? Enough stalling...
Here we go...
Here's my concern...
I've heard stories about how you're
gonna react to this, and
if I see half of you running around,
well I just know I'm gonna freak out.
So if you could do your best
to minimize that part of it...
I'd just really appreciate it.
Sprouts it is.
You really out here
looking for deer?
Thought they were all gone.
What do you want Harry ?
Do you think you could come
into city hall today ?
Gray’s still out, and
it’d be nice to have...
somebody around who knows
what they're doing.
Not my job anymore, and get lost,
I'm trying to shoot some deer.
Just be for a day or two.
You're starting to look an
awful lot like a deer, Harry.
I've been in the FBI
for 15 years.
I worked law enforcement after college,
and then I joined the bureau.
Where did you go to school ?
Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ?
The FBI, what were
you working on ?
I was sent here to monitor
the phone calls
made in the area to a...
suspected terrorist cell.
- And what did you find out ?
- Nothing.
Trail went dead.
We about done here ?
Not even close.
Tell me about her...
Sarah Mason.
She's gone.
You're pretty thorough.
Also took care of the one
in the cabinet
and the one behind
the water heater.
There's only one loaded
gun in this house...
and it's mine.
Sit down.
Arms behind you.
Tell me about Sarah.
Jimmy said she was also
a cop in St Louis.
She's working with you ?
Against you ?
Who are these people ?
You are making a serious mistake.
- I am a Federal Officer.
- Really ?
Really sure you're not.
Robert Willer...
State Department.
How about Robert Snyder...
Colombus PD ?
Commander Robert Richmond...
Naval Intelligence.
None of those are real...
and neither is that badge.
Who the hell are you ?
Who do you you work for ?
You do not wanna know
what I know.
- I think I can handle it.
- Really ?
Cause I can barely handle it,
and I was trained for this.
You want to tell me...
or you tell the whole town.
All right.
But once you hear this...
You are a part of it, Jake,
and there is no going back.
Who do you work for ?
CIA.
Sarah Mason and I were part of
an off-the-books team.
We were tracking the bombs
used in the attack.
Where did they come from...
the bombs ?
The US government
brought them in.
See, after the Soviet Union fell...
neglected military in the
satellite republics started
selling their nuclear stockpiles
on the black market.
So the CIA started
an operation...
get that material by any
and all means necessary.
But a few years ago, a shipment
disappeared on its way
to the DOE storage complex
in Oak Ridge.
And that is where my
CIA team came in.
Why you ?
I'm the best at what I do.
And what is that ?
Satellite installation.
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
with Mr. Higgins.
I've been inside all day.
How's the weather out there ?
You know, it looks like rain.
Thank you.
- Hello Victor.
- Hawkins.
I believe you know
everyone here...
except this young lady.
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.
All right, let's get down to it.
We have a lot of
ground to cover.
As most of you know...
a shipment of nukes from
project Red Bell is missing.
What you don't know...
is that we have quality intel
that those warheads...
have been converted
into 25 small...
high yield devices.
These bombs have been
dissiminated to extremists cells
active within the United States.
So, is this Al Qaeda ?
I wish it were that simple.
It's much larger than that.
It's a cross section of
domestic militias...
anarchists,
and religious fanatics.
As you can see,
these are terrorists...
that would never collaborate,
ideologically or politically.
The only thing that links
them, is the desire
to take down the
federal government.
Our job, is to get undercover
in these cells...
and find these bombs.
So who do we think
is orchestrating this ?
The agency's been at this
from every angle...
and all we know is that
he's got deep ressources,
an ability to coordinate
diverse groups,
and by all indications...
he's an American.
We were broken up
into groups of two.
Each unit was...
assigned a terrorist cell.
One agent went undercover,
one acted as a handler.
You can't expect me to believe
you were sent here...
undercover.
What's so special
about this place ?
You know, I would
show you, but...
that's clever.
It's over there...
behind the map.
Where did you get this ?
Those are defense department projections
they've been doing since the 50s.
The fallout scenarios in the event of
a nuclear attack on 20 US cities.
And you see Jericho ?
It's outside the fallout zones, Jake.
It's got a salt mine,
plenty of farm land,
and access to an untainted
water table.
So you weren't here to
monitor phone calls ?
Jericho was a rally-point in case
we failed in our mission.
Failed ?
Or succeeded ?
And Johnston, was...
He wanted to come,
I know he did.
He's just having a hard time
dealing with things lately.
He always gets quiet...
when he's going through
something, but...
just wish I could think
of something
to help him get through this.
We miss you, sweetheart.
There's no more sprouts.
You finished them ?
I was hungry.
What are you doing here, Sean.
It's like 9:30 in the morning...
Oh, my...
You slept here ?
Well, actually... there was not a
lot of sleeping going on.
Get out of the house !
What are you doing ?
- You let him spend a night ?
- Yes.
Well that doesn't seem like something
Stanley would approve of, does it ?
Stanley's not here.
Just like that. You infiltrated a
terror cell planning a nuclear attack ?
Yeah...
just like that.
It took me 2 years.
8 months of it in prison...
developing contacts,
getting into the network.
The only outside person I
communicated with was my handler.
After prison,
I spent another year
trying to gain their trust
on the outside.
And even then, I was only
scratching the surface.
But you got in.
How ?
They were looking for
high grade government IDs.
You gave them their badges !
I had to proove that I was loyal
and valuable to the cell, Jake.
- I think I've heard enough.
- No !
You barely scratched
the surface.
You're the one who
wanted to hear this,
so why don't you hear it all ?
The cell was looking for IDs.
And I needed to get higher up
in their organisation.
So I let it be known
that I had a source.
See, the badges...
were going to be tagged so that
my team could track them.
They sent me to make the buy
with another cell member.
It was a kid named Daryl.
How do we know
these are real ?
They're real enough.
Where did you get them from ?
How and where I got these
badges... is my business.
What you do with them...
is yours.
- Nice doing business with you.
- You too.
We should celebrate, man.
Go out, get some girls.
Except you don't really seem
like the type. All serious.
Are you married ?
I was.
Really ?
What happened ?
What the hell is going on ?
Hold it right there !
I'm sorry man.
You gotta be kidding me.
FBI !
Hands in the air !
Back against the car.
<i>It turns out Daryl was
an FBI informant.
But my handler got me out,
and we kept my cover intact.
So the FBI have an informant
in my target cell.
And they can't tell us
anything about that ?
You know, I'm damn lucky
that my cover wasn't blown.
- Your cover's intact, yes ?
- Yeah, we believe so.
Then let's move on.
Have you been able to make contact
with those coordinating the attack ?
No... but at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells
that we've already inflitrated.
You know, at the very least that
would disrupt the overall plan...
maybe delay it for...
- How many of the bombs can you get ?
A third, for sure...
half if we're lucky.
Look... I know...
it's not ideal, but at this stage,
it is the safest move.
That's still a dozen
bombs in play.
- What are you doing ?
- I just think there's a way to...
speed this up and get
all the bombs at once.
- Yeah, and we agreed that...
- Do you mind ?
I think there may be a way
to get us further inside.
My partner tells the cell leader
that Daryl is the FBI informant.
That gives him the credibility
that he needs to move up faster.
Then let us handle the FBI...
and do whatever is necessary
to save the operation.
- It's all gonna take some time,
but we're close  - OK.
We're counting on you,
and you know the risks.
You'd better be right about this.
This is the right way to go.
Trust me.
What would you have done ?
Stayed in,
or pulled the plug ?
It seems like the wrong
question to me.
I'd ask myself how much
I trusted my partner.
Well, if I can sneak up here without
you so much as turning around...
how are you gonna
hear any game ?
I heard you half a mile
back in those shoes.
You said you'd come with me
to see April today.
Fine.
You coming home for dinner ?
There are no deer in these woods,
they've all been picked clean.
Then, I guess I'll
be here a while.
I never wanted to be a mom'.
I didn't sign up for this.
You know what, you're right.
I owe it to Stanley.
So I'm just gonna have
to jump in...
with both feet, whether she wants
to hear from me or not.
Listen to me going on
about my own problems.
You must be ady to take this hatchet
and do the damn job yourself.
I didn't know that he
knew how to sign.
What did he say to you ?
Never mind, look...
That boy's bad news.
Now, I can't stop you
from seeing him...
but he is no longer welcome in this
house, do you understand me ?
Allison...
so why do you feel like you
can't hang out at home ?
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.
It's not that I don't wanna
talk about it.
It's just...
my family's pretty weird.
My family was pretty weird too.
In fact, when I was your age, I didn't
want to hang out with them either.
What about now ?
They're gone.
There's this thing that went
down at my house...
a couple weeks ago.
I did something.
OK. What did you do ?
I did something that...
can't be forgiven.
Now my mom just keeps...
looking at me.
Like I've changed into some kind
of monster, or something.
You know you haven't, right ?
So... even though you
weren't sure about the plan,
you outed the informant
to the cell leader.
Once we decided to leave
the bombs in play,
it was the only way for me to
get deep enough into the cell
and gain their trust.
I told the cell leader that
Daryl was the informant,
but I wanted to get him out of there
before they killed him.
Come on, grab what you
need and let's go.
They're gonna hunt me down,
and they're gonna kill me.
It's your lucky day, Daryl.
They're gonna get you into witness
protection, so don't worry.
We're gonna get
you out of here.
Stay there.
- Damn it !
- What is it ?
<i>Daryl, we just wanna talk.
The cell leader.
You gotta get me
out of this place.
Run !
I'll tell them that
you got away.
I think my leg is broken.
Please, help me !
Or I'm gonna tell them
who you really are.
I'm sorry.
<i>So, I finally gain their trust.
<i>I was in.
You killed him.
It was either killed him...
or possibly let millions
of people die.
They died anyway.
<i>Jake ?
<i>You're still down there ?
Call him off.
You're not helping your cause by
keeping that gun in my face.
<i>Hey, Jake ?
Do not make me kill him Jake.
All right.
- All right !
<i>- Jake ?
What's going on, Jake ?
We need a little more
time, that's all.
- You're sure ?
- Yeah, we're all right.
- I... I'm out front.
- OK.
Turn around, Jake.
It is not about this anymore.
We're past this.
Starting now,
we trust each other.
You need to tell me everything.
Done telling.
Now, I gotta show you.
What are you doing here ?
It's your first day
at a new school.
You know, the last time you had one
of those, Sam was in diapers.
Doesn'’t look like you
had a big turnout.
No, most people left early.
I guess you knew better.
I figured you didn't really want
me around the house anyway.
Why would you say that ?
You know...
because of what I did.
Allison, I love you.
OK ? Nothing will
change that.
Hear me baby ?
Nothing will change that.
My little girl.
Mom, please
don't be mad at me.
I'm so sorry, mom'.
- Here's the part I don't get.
- What ?
If you're telling the truth...
you made it.
You made it deep inside the cell,
you gained their trust.
Right.
Then, what happened ?
Somebody tipped off the
terrorists, Jake.
Before we could find out who...
<i>the terrorists moved up
their plan.
Victor ?
We made a mistake,
<i>a very big mistake.</i>
This is the moment we prepared for.
Strike will go off tomorrow,
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.
OK. No... listen !
The trucks...
they're white.
License plate
Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...
<i>I tried to warn the agency...
<i>but we were too late.
Some of the bombs were meant
for New York.
We managed to head them off.
Even after 4 years of work...
I couldn't stop all of them.
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.
Since when have
you been funny ?
I have always been funny.
Yeah, not for a long time.
What is it Rob ?
- Rob ?
- I won't be long.
Not interrupting, am I ?
You know you are.
You're not exactly
returning our calls.
I told my wife I was done.
I promised her, Victor.
- We need you back.
- Why me ?
Because you're the best
at what you do.
Which is what ?
Your family will be there,
when you get back.
Team is meeting tomorrow.
Come listen to what this
is all about.
If you wanna walk
away after that...
you walk away.
2 o'clock...
tomorrow.
Tell the desk jockey you have an
appointment with Mr. Higgins.
If they ask about the weather...
tell hem it's gonna rain.
Who was that ?
I might need to go
to a meeting tomorow.
I can't keep doing this,
I can't.
We'll be fine, D.
What is that ?
It's the end of the
rabbit hole, Jake.
Gimme a hand with this.
So you believe me now ?
Is that what I think it is ?
It was meant for Columbus, Ohio.
You brought a nuclear bomb...
here.
What would you have
done with it ?
What do you gonna do with it ?
I'm gonna keep it safe.
I'm gonna keep it secret,
you know. Because...
it gives the town some power, Jake,
but it also makes them a target.
Look...
I know what you're thinking...
You're wishing you'd walked away
when I gave you the chance, right ?
Why didn’t you show me thing
when I walked in the door today.
You didn't walk in.
<i>Jake ?
<i>Hey, Jake ?
I've been watching you, Jake...
and you can handle yourself.
And I've seen what a help
you have been to this stown.
But I needed to know
that I can trust you.
That you could handle it
if I told you everything.
<i>Jake ?
This bomb...
it's our burden, now.
Whatever happens next...
that is gonna be
up to you. OK ?
He's FBI.
Just like he said.
But...
We're in good hands.
That's good to hear.
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Hawkins.
We do that, outside.
I didn't know that.
There’s something
I want to say to you.
I'm still learning...
so just, please bear with me.
Stanley...
is...
important...
to me.
You... are...
important... to me.
I... want... you...
to be safe.
So please... be patient...
with me.
I'm trying...
I'll try too.
So...
hug ?
Right.
I brought you some dinner.
Thank you.
<i>You know what, I am damn lucky
that my cover wasn’t blown.
<i>- Your cover's intact ?
- Yeah, we believe so.
<i>Then let's move on.
<i>But at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells
<i>that we've already
infiltrated...
<i>How many of the bombs
can you get ?
How many of the bombs
can you get ?

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Oh, my God, Ted.
- Jake, this is... Ted Lewis.
- Hey, how you doing?
We grew up together over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.
I'm gonna help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.
- You're just going to leave?
- Won't be for very long.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No, the question is: how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
- They get tired of you being sheriff?
- No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
Can we buy some more of these things?
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.
- We're going to need food.
- Won't see another crop till spring.
Spring crop is what I'm talking about.
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.
Starve next fall or freeze this winter.
Okay, look,
we'll give you the food.
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.
We're going to need ten Jericho
men to help us build them.
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?
I am not going to build
these things on credit.
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.
What you are about to do...
means this town's survival.
All right, let's move out.
If anything happens
to any of them...
you're the first one I come for.
I know.
<i>Hey, Jeff, they're back.
I didn't expect to see
you till spring, Russell.
I thought you might
be needing these.
Your windmills.
It's good to see our guys back, but...
it's going to take some time for me
to find the guys to replace them.
You don't need to replace them.
Well, now, wait...
our agreement was that
we got ten windmills
for ten percent of the crops.
You'll get your windmills,
but we don't need your men.
Constantino called it
an act of good faith.
I didn't think Constantino
knew that term.
But...
I'll take it.
Stanley!
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Where's Eric?
He didn't come back, Mary.
He said he wasn't ready.
But...
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Okay.
Thanks.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
- None of us did.
- How are you? You okay?
Where's Eric?
Come here.
He didn't come back with us.
Why not?
When I talked to him, he was still
pretty messed up about April's death.
He said he was thinking about
staying in New Bern for a while
to get his head together.
- When was this?
Three days ago.
Then, he didn't show up for work,
and I haven't seen him since.
I don't know what's
going on in New Bern.
When I asked about Eric,
they couldn't tell me anything.
Then, the cops started escorting
us wherever we went.
Then today, out of nowhere,
Russell says,
"Pack it up, we're going home",
like...
like it wasn't safe for us
there anymore.
Where's my brother?
- I don't know.
- What?
I know he hasn't been
seen for a few days.
Did you even try to find him?
- I asked Constantino.
- And?
And he told me that
they were looking for him.
And then this morning, he told me
to bring the rest of your guys home.
What the hell's going on
over there, Russell?
Should I be worried about him?
Answer me.
Should I be worried?
I would be.
- I'm going with you.
- No...
you've been gone for weeks.
Go home.
You need someone who knows
their way around New Bern.
I'll try to find Heather
as soon as I get there.
She knows it better than any of us.
Look, it's not safe out there.
You can't go by yourself.
I'm not.
I need your help.

You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china, Jake.
I got to try and find him.
I can't just...
There's something going on in that town.
I can feel it.
Stanley starts asking questions,
and they just send them home?
Okay, but you understand why
I can't just up and leave, right?
- He's my brother.
- And you said he was upset,
so maybe he just...
- If you're saying no, just say no.
Come on, Jake, I'm not saying no.
I'm saying we got to
understand the situation.
The situation is...
he's been missing for three days,
and I came to you...
for help.
Okay.
But if we do this,
we do it my way.
Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you're home.
I missed you guys so much.
You're totally back.
<i>Mrs. Green.
I'm really sorry to bother
you like this, but...
I thought you should know.
Know what?
The men came back from New Bern,
and Eric wasn't with them.
Why not?
He decided to stay a little longer.
Decided to or Constantino insisted?
Stanley talked to him.
He said...
he said he wasn't ready
to come home.
- How'd you hurt your hand?
- Oh, I just...
was trying to fix the copper
tubing on my still.
It just popped off and cut me.
Is alcohol really a priority right now?
Actually, it's not to drink.
I was trying to make antiseptic
for the med center.
I should go.
- You got any sand over there
at the bar?  - Sand?
Yeah, I think I can show you a way
around that copper tubing.
I'll just give you a hand.
See you in a bit.
Guys... yo, listen.
Stop unloading that.
Put that back.
What the hell is this?
- Salt.  - Who gave you permission
to take it from the mine?
51% of the mine belongs to me.
I just took it from my half.
You don't have a half...
of anything. Your parents do.
Look, I know you still think
of me as a child...
and I can't help it if that's
where you're stuck,
but the fact is I have
a right to what I own.
You are a minor and
you don't own anything
as long as your parents
are still alive.
Or do you have some information
that I don't have?
Look, just... just take
the salt back to the mine
and don't make me have to
send my guys to do it.
Proof of residence?
We're not from here.
Sorry, you're going to need
to turn this car around
and proceed back
the way you came.
I'm here to see my brother.
His name is Eric Green.
You're not hearing me, sir.
No one's allowed...
No, you're not hearing me.
I have to see him.
He came here as part of the deal
you made with Jericho. Now...
Hey, Jake...
I want to talk to Phil Constantino.
- Get out of the car.
- Hell, no.
Put your hands on the dashboard.
I want to see your hands.
That's Johnston Green's son.
Let him through.
I'll escort him in
to see Sheriff Constantino.
Go ahead, let him through.
<i>Mister, Mister.
Do you have any food?
I'm sorry, I don't...
I'm sorry, I don't have any.
All right, ma'am, come on.
Get those kids out of there.
Hey, come on.
<i>Come on, please.
I thought we had it bad.
What the hell happened here?
Ravenwood.
My brother is missing.
I know. I've got patrols
out looking for him.
- And no leads?
- No.
Sorry, I wish there's
more I could do.
You're the sheriff and the mayor.
You can do more.
I'm trying, Jake.
You sure Eric even
wants to be found?
What's that supposed to mean?
We all knew April.
We know what happened.
Last I heard that Eric was
having a tough time.
He'll be fine as soon as
we get him home.
You know what?
Let's face the facts.
He might have been attacked.
Could be lying in a
ditch somewhere.
- Why would you say...
- Take it easy!
The fact is some folks around here
aren't too fond of Jericho these days.
That's why I sent the workers home
today. When your brother went missing,
I got worried for their safety.
Why?
There's been a lot of rumors
flying around about your town.
What are people saying?
They're mad that Jericho didn't
warn us about Ravenwood.
They think you're going to renege
on your part of the food deal.
We've had it rough here, okay?
They're just looking for
somebody to blame.
- Where was Eric last seen?
- The factory.
End of his shift.
Look, we're just trying to help.
What is it that you want
that we're not giving?
I want to talk to Heather Lisinski.
<i>Take care of each other, Kansas.
Anything new from Mr. Hewitt?
No, it's just the same bulletin about
the riots in Chicago Camp West.
Hey, thanks for taking on a shift.
Jimmy, it's the least I can do
to make myself useful.
I feel like such a freeloader
sitting around your house all day.
You kidding me?
You're like the best houseguest ever.
You cook, you do the dishes, you
never get bored playing Boggle.
And we're dreading the day you
and your husband work things out.
That sounded a lot less
insensitive in my head.
- I'm sorry.
- No, I understand, thank you.
Listen...
can I talk you about something?
Yeah, what is it?
Last night Sam and Woody were
drawing pictures.
That's one of Sam's.
I didn't want to bring it up at
the house with everyone around,
I thought it might be upsetting.
No, I'm glad you showed
this to me.
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but that really looks like a kid
dealing with some kind of trauma.
I'm-I'm not surprised.
I mean....
30 million people died a few months ago.
I'll bet there's kids all over the
country still trying to process that.
Maybe, but it's so specific.
The bodies, the house.
He's coming by after school.
I'll talk to him then.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Sand keeps the copper from buckling.
How'd you learn this?
Well...
like... most things that
are fun and illegal...
from my dad.
So the stories Eric tells are true.
Afraid so.
You remember that book...
something about...
women are from Venus,
and men are wrong.
Not that I read the book, mind you,
but I did,  you know...
flip through Gail's copy of it.
Lot of stuff in there about
men needing to...
go off and hold up in
a cave sometime.
Now, I don't know if this was
actually in the book, but...
if men can't find a cave,
they'll make one.
Out of...
whatever circumstances happen
to be lying around.
Yeah, you're probably right.
I'm sure that's all it is.
This isn't your fault, Mary.
It wasn't anybody's fault.
I think Eric's figuring that out.
This place is the only reason New Bern
made it through the Depression.
The factory whistle's like
a heartbeat to this town.
Put the wind turbines binds
together just down here.
Sheriff!
Who's that?
It's a friend of Heather's.
We met him at Black Jack.
Good news.
- This guy knows where your brother is.
- Really? Where?
Eric went home.
He and Heather both.
They... left this morning.
- Home? To Jericho?
- Why would they do that?
Why didn't they go
with the convoy?
Well, Heather had to talk
him into going. So...
by then, the other guys had left.
So, I lent them my car
and my rifle.
They didn't seem worried at all.
Probably back in Jericho by now.
Right.
- Hope they're okay.
- Thank you.
- We got to clear the building.
- All right.
What happened?
We had to retrofit all the
machines after the EMP,
and one of them overheated.
Caught part of the building on fire.
You got what you need?
Yeah, mystery solved, I guess.
Good. Glad to hear it.
If there's nothing else, Deputy Perkins
will escort you out of town.
No. We don't need
to be escorted.
It's policy.
You're big on policy.
We almost lost everything when
Ravenwood came through here.
I'm big on anything that
keeps us alive.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Move the truck.
Let them through.
- You buying any of that story?
- Nope.
Neither was Ted.
Slipped me this when
he shook my hand.
- It's an address and...
- "Come Alone"
So, we done here?
<i>Back it up.
<i>Let them through.
How long have I been gone?
No, before you answer that,
how long has he been here?
- It's very recent really.
He hasn't been here that long.
I asked you to do one
thing for me, Mimi.
One thing!
You know, you listen
to me, Stanley.
Your sister is not a child anymore.
You can't just throw this fit
and kick Sean's ass
and think that's going
to be the end of it
I hope you're going to
explain why I can't.
Because if you do,
she's just going to latch
on that much tighter.
Unless they really get angry,
in which case, the age-old teenage
remedy is to run away,
which used to mean that they'd
hear from them in a couple of days
when they ran out of bus money.
Nowadays, chances are much better
that you'll find their bodies
on the side of a road.
Look...
right now it is under our roof.
And it's a pain in the ass, I know,
but it's a safe and manageable
pain in the ass,
and I suggest you let it stay here
before it turns into anything
more than that.
That's Perkins' truck.
What's he doing staking
out Ted's trailer?
Let's ask him.
Hand your gun to my friend,
and let's pay Ted a little visit.
Come on.
Where's my brother?
I don't know, ask him.
He threatened to throw me in jail this
morning if I didn't feed you that lie.
- So you haven't seen Eric?
- No. Not for days.
- What about Heather?
- She left for work this morning.
Next thing I know, they tell
me she's gone missing, too.
Two people disappear,
nobody knows anything?
Oh, somebody does.
Right?
Where is he?
Screw you.
Hey, come on, Jake,
we got to be smarter than that.
We need answers.
Getting answers...
is easy.
It's getting the truth...
that takes work.
When did you last see Eric Green?
Look...
this is not my thing.
I didn't ask you that, did I?
Why do you act like
we did something wrong?
We were attacked.
How do you figure that?
The those machines didn't overheat
this morning at the factory.
It was his brother...
and that girl.
They sabotaged it.
They would never do that?
We need that factory
just as much as you do.
- I saw them.
- If you saw them, then where are they?
They ran away.
Hold his knees, please.
Look,
why would I be staking out
a trailer park if we had them? Huh?
Constantino put us on alert.
He gave a SOS.
- SOS?
- Shoot on sight.
Look at me.
What is in that factory?
I don't know.
No, I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
Ask Constantino.
Ask Constantino.
He knows?
Look at me.
- We go to the factory.
- But Eric...
I don't know about Eric.
But we cannot search this whole town.
So we should go and see what it was
that he was risking his life for.
All right.
You got some place safe you can go?
Yeah, my grandfather has
an old hunting cabin.
You take what's important because
you are not coming back here.
Get up.
On your knees.
What is he doing?
- Down on your knees.
- What?
What are you doing?
Hawkins!
Is that doing it your way?
You asked me to come along.
- What were you going to do?
- You want the truth?
Less than you would have.
You see, I've done...
I've done enough, Jake,
to know better.
It's the fear of torture
that gets results.
Actual torture only works
in the movies.
And this one guy, he was
so skinny, you could
count his ribs through his shirt.
I tried to give him food when I could,
but none of us had much so...
And then one day, I could just...
see it in his eyes.
He'd, uh...
he'd given up.
I never thought I'd be so
thankful to live on a farm.
From now on, I promise
I'll only complain intermittently.
Well, we don't have much, but, uh...
we'll always have enough, so...
Dude, all they need to do
is get the Internet back up.
After that, it's a piece of cake.
Why is that?
Well, you could do anything.
I mean, you could run for president.
Make a virtual White House.
Fly a plane into that.
I mean, virtual cities and towns...
nothing to nuke.
- Yeah, but...
where would we get...
stuff?
What stuff?
I don't know.
Food, clothes, blankets, fuel.
Not a problem.
After the Internet is back up,
you just order all that stuff.
You know, Stanley,
you would not believe
how helpful Sean has been
around here with the livestock,
and the house,
and... just everything.
It's true.
Yeah, it's weird, Stanley, 'cause
I am much more of a vibe guy.
What the hell is a vibe guy?
You know...
I mean, I've never been into, like,
physical labor.
I'm more the guy that people
have around for my vibe.
My house, my rules, my vibe.
And you sleep there.
So anyhow, it's, like, 3:00 a. m.,
I've got this flashlight in my face.
Gail's over on her side of
the bed trying to find the phone
to call the cops and finally,
I located the light switch.
It's Eric,
who's standing there and he says,
"I can't go to sleep until
I confess I'm drunk. "
I said, "You're what?"
He said, "I'm drunk."
"It won't ever happen again.
I don't know what I was thinking."
Well, meantime,
he looks perfectly normal,
his speech isn't slurred or anything.
Gail starts grilling him. Turns out
he has had a beer and a half.
I said to him,
"Son, do you have any idea
how much beer it takes to get drunk?"
He said, "No, I don't. "
I said, "Well, get out of here and
don't wake me up again until you do."
He left, Gail and
I just could not stop laughing.
She doesn't laugh too much anymore.
Here I am rambling on. We probably ought
to go take a look at that still.
Good idea.
Hey, buddy.
Your mom just ran to the little
girls' room. Why don't you grab a seat?
Could you give us a minute?
Sure.
Say, you know what?
Why don't we go sit in my office,
maybe we can talk.
About what?
About your artwork.
This is Russell.
He saved our butts out
at the Black Jack.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm Skylar.
Stevens, right?
Something we can help you with?
Well, I was thinking
we could help each other.
You've got a salt mine
with no real distributor.
I've got men, trucks, guns,
but no supplies.
- If we become partners...
- Partners?
I'm asking for half
your share of the mine.
We're doing okay now.
Okay, but the people in Jericho,
they only need so much salt.
I've been out there.
I know the trade routes,
where to find the highest bidders
and how to make it
back here in one piece.
What's in it for us?
Bigger profits.
Where I'm going, I can get you
five times what you can make here.
And...
I'll deal with Gray Anderson for you.
When do you need an answer?
Before I leave in the morning.
Believe me,
this is good for everyone.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
It's our mine.
And our town.
They sliced it up like they own it.
What do they know that we don't?
Come on.
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?
We were talking about my drawings.
Look, do you mind waiting
in the lobby a minute?
I just need to talk to
Mr. Taylor alone. Okay?
What are you doing?
Darcy, something going on,
and it's not just about the bombs.
My son has enough to deal with,
you know, without
being poked and prodded.
If there's a problem with him,
I'll take care of it myself.
Right.
Thank you.
For what?
Letting Sean stay.
You're welcome.
And for not calling him an idiot
even when he is done.
Okay, if you know that...
Sorry. Just a little frog
in my throat.
Don't let me interrupt your nice
sibling-bonding moment.
That's what it is, right?
Sean can be an idiot,
but he can also be really great.
All guys are like that,
you have to put up with the
"idiot" stuff...
to get to the "great" stuff.
Yeah? And where did you come
by that litlle pearl of wisdom?
What did she say about me?
When did he learn how to sign?
He's sleeping with a deaf girl.
That's my sister.
I guess if Sean Henthorn is
my biggest problem, then
I'm a pretty lucky guy.
Want to get luckier?
What are you doing?
It's binding.
The lawyer said it makes me
an emancipated minor.
By declaring your parents dead?
This is wrong
in every way that
something can be wrong.
- Let's just forget about this.
- You can't do that.
- It's legal.
- So,
what, are you gonna pedal your little
bike to Topeka and file this, Dale?
Forget that I'm the mayor.
Okay, I'm speaking to you as
your parents' friend.
My parents would want me to have
my share of the salt mine
Your parents are coming back.
And if it turns out that
that is not true,
then I will help you learn the business.
And who decides when that happens?
You?
I mean my decision, are you saying
laws don't apply any more?
You didn't make a decision.
You signed a piece of paper.
Do you really want your parents
to be dead that badly?
- Okay, stop it.
- No.
You're advising her, Dale.
Did you also tell her
how her parents died?
Because New York survived,
so I guess you probably had
to get pretty creative, right?
Were they killed there?
Or were they murdered
on their way back
to the child who meant
everything to them?
It's just a piece of paper.
Come on.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're running a munitions factory.
Hurry up.
Constantino wants those tonight.
We'll have them ready.
They're getting ready for war.
We need to get back to town.
No, we need to try and stop them.
Cover me.
Hey, there he goes.
Down there.
Hold it!
Hand it over.
Sorry. I guess I'm late for dinner.
Or lunch.
Take your pick.
I was helping Mary.
It took longer than I expected.
You told Eric we'd take care of her.
What I meant was that
we'd help keep her alive.
What I didn't mean was that
we'd run over there
and spend the entire day
every time she needed
somebody to do
a little heavy lifting.
Wait.
You don't think
I'm the reason Eric left?
Do you?
Is that what you think?
I think Eric left for
a lot of reasons...
...but Mary may be why he comes back.
I don't want to have to come back
to this house again.
Did you get all the toys you want?
So,
what did you and Mr. Taylor
talk about today?
Nothing.
Now, Sam, you know we don't keep
secrets in this family.
Yeah, I know, baby.
What's he doing here?
I think we should talk.
Hey, Sam, honey,
why don't you go upstairs
to your room and
get that last box, okay?
Hey, buddy.
Look, I-I understand, you know,
you being curious about my family.
We haven't made a lot of friends here.
We just kind of keep to ourselves, but
if you want to ask any questions,
just talk to me, okay?
Leave my children out of it.
But I think Sam's trying to say
something with that drawing.
Something he can't put into words.
What do you mean?
He's drawing a little boy
that's afraid...
...because his dad's not
around to protect him
or his family.
I told him he's not alone.
I know what it's like to have
parents who have split up.
I told him
I'd been through it, and...
I think I turned out okay, so...
I think you turned out better
than okay, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
So, I guess I'll head back
to the house then.
See you there.
Thank you, Jimmy.
Sure.
- How did it go?
- Good.
Turbines all went up without a hitch.
Thank...
Thank you.
You were as good as your word.
Even better.
I'm glad you see it that way,
because I have another
proposition for you.
We need salt.
Well, it's no problem.
I'll have my guys load up your truck.
Well, actually,
I mean to help you sell it.
We were thinking
a quarter stake in the mine.
Would we be Constantino?
Is that what all of
this good will was about?
No. Hear me out.
This will work for both of us.
For both of our towns.
If you agree to let me sell salt
from the mine.
I'm sorry.
I guess you and the, uh, Olsen twins
think this is kind of cute.
Well, for whatever it's worth,
we did conduct a legal transaction.
- Not for sale.
- Your people on New Bern
who think it should be.
- I don't care what they think.
You need to.
When I saw that
map of Jericho,
I asked Heather about it.
She didn't think
New Bern could do that to us.
Then she snuck in, and, uh...
she saw the mortars and...
their plans.
Look, you're going back to whatever
rock you crawled out from under.
Dan, get in here!
Mr. Mayor, there's a lot more
going on here than you realize.
- Is that so?
- I'm trying to help you.
Look, New Bern barely
survived the winter.
And the people there, they know
the food is coming from you.
And they also know that it's not going
to be enough to feed everyone,
and so, some of them, they're thinking,
what can we do about that
right now?
I want you to find every deputy you can
and get them up to the salt mine.
I want it under heavy guard
until further notice.
Gray, I've already got men up there.
Gray, listen to me.
This deal is a good thing.
I know you don't see it that way
right now, but please,
you do not want the alternative.
These rumors about Jericho,
about the food hoarding,
about how they sicced Ravenwood on us...
maybe they're not just rumors.
We restored their power supply,
and now that Jericho has what it needs,
it has no intention of making good
on its half of the deal.
Why didn't you just leave town?
'Cause we wanted to break the machine,
stop the factory.
Then they caught us.
They brought me here.
So, where is she?
Where is Heather?
She's dead, Jake.
But it's not enough for them
to keep their food
and leave us to starve.
You, up. You, too.
They want to see us destroyed.
I looked their mayor in the eye,
I told him how desperate
our situation was.
But on the day
that we made good
on our end of the deal,
what did they do?
They tried to destroy the factory
that keeps this town alive.
Here's your proof.
These are the sons of Johnston Green,
sent from Jericho to wreak
havoc on this town.
Now we know,
if these people had their way,
New Bern would cease to exist.
With your help
and sacrifice,
I will make sure that
that never happens.

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Hello, Jonah.
Guy did four years at Lansing
for extortion and assault.
Why are you talking to him?
It's okay, all right?
It didn't have anything to do with you.
He's my father...
it has everything to do with me.
Jonah agrees to leave town
and not come back.
Exile.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No, the question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?
No, I m still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
All right, let's get it up
as fast as we can.
Can we bust some more
of these things?
You got one of the only salt mines
around for 400 miles.
We're going to need food.
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, look, we'll give you the food.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.
You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliced it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
There was going to be
an explosion in town.
Hopefully, we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.
Everybody, go!
All right, keep alert.
Jake said the New Bern guys
might be coming right behind them.
Maybe they're already here.
What is that?
What happened?
We got a major problem, Gray.
Where's Eric?
He's fine.
He's at the med center.
Well, is it about the mine?
It's a lot worse than that.
Who are you?
Stop moving.
You hear me?
I'm talking to you.
Freeze!
Who are you?
I think we killed...
six in New Bern.
I counted eight.
Who's this?
Says he's from New Bern.
Wanted to talk to you.
What is this about?
<i>Am I speaking to Gray Anderson?
<i>This is Phil Constantino.
<i>Henry, you can
come home now, son.
<i>We're still cleaning the blood
of eight deputies
<i>off the sidewalks of New Bern,
<i>so you need to understand
our position.
<i>We need seven farms,
<i>including the Jackson farm,
<i>the Herbert farm,
<i>and the Richmond farm.
And we need half the salt mine.
You have four hours to respond.
I don't understand.
What are you asking us to do?
Jericho is about to be invaded.
For the sake of your people,
I'm asking you...
to surrender.

We have border patrol on duty
at all the checkpoints
and all the new roadblocks,
but we're scrambling
to cover everywhere else.
- Did you see anything out there?
- No, nothing.
What is he actually going to do?
Just march in here and
start shooting us?
We were high school football rivals
five months ago.
They tortured my brother to find out
how many troops we have, what weapons.
They have made hundreds of mortars.
My guess says they can hit
from as far as...
two miles out.
Having them and using them on people
are two different things.
That's what they said
about nuclear bombs.
How much time left?
50 minutes.
<i>Haven't been able to get a pulse
from this baby for an hour.
<i>Respiration is 16, pulse is 84.
<i>Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.
Just hold the pressure.
Put pressure right there,
right there.
Press.
Harder. Damn it!
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?
- I am trying to save April.
-<i> The baby's heart has stopped.
- What do you mean it's stopped?
- Do something.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's get you fixed up, okay?
Come on, sweetheart.
We're not going to give anything
to these people.
Mrs. Herbert?
I just wanted to offer the town
a solution.
You cannot give away that farm.
Gray said it's too far out of town
for the rangers to help.
I can't stand out there with a rifle.
- Then I'll defend it.
- Really?
Are you abandoning it?
The bank owns half of that farm anyway.
You just...
do whatever you want, Dale.
Wait, let's be clear.
If I defend it, then it's all mine.
If you can defend it.
Dale, how are we going
to defend that farm?
Get me every refugee you can find.
All right.
Careful.
I was so scared.
When you didn't come back, I thought...
I'm back.
Oh, God!
I'm sorry.
I don't want to hurt you.
I'm okay.
Listen up! Guys!
They said you had some food here.
Yeah... I do have food.
As of this morning, I own
the second biggest farm in Jericho.
Now...
I'm going to need men to defend it
if we're invaded.
What do we get?
The promise of three meals a day.
You want us to risk our lives
for a promise?
No way.
Guys, listen, listen!
Since you've been here, you've been
asking for a place to live, food.
You came here as refugees,
and you're still being treated
like second-class citizens.
That's no way to live.
If you fight for my farm and we win,
then everybody gets an equal split
It'll be your farm.
You'll have a stake in this town
that nobody can take away from you.
You'll never have to ask anyone
for anything ever again.
So...
who wants a future?
Constantin said four hours.
It's already been four hours.
You okay?
Come here.
What do we hear from the rangers?
Runners came in.
They haven't seen anything.
Should we call Constantino?
I don't have anything to tell him.
And I'm not just going
to give the town away.
There's something I need to tell you.
It's crazy. Everybody's saying
that New Bern's going to attack us.
We don't know. Look...
Something happened to Heather.
She found out New Bern
was building mortars.
She tried to stop them and they...
they caught her.
Nobody's seen her since.
- What did they do to her?
- I don't know.
Is she dead?
Jake, is she dead?
Get away from the windows!
Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?
- I'm good. I'm good.
Wait here.
Are you okay?
Somebody help!
Mom.
Mom!
Cover your eyes!
Jake, you okay?
Honey?
- Mom.
- Sweetheart, look at me.
- Look at me.
- I can't hear.
I know, sweetie.
That'll come back.
- We're right here, Mom.
- What's happening?
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be fine.
Let's get you to the med center,
honey.
Come on.
Get everybody off the street.
There might be more coming.
We got to open the shelters
and the town hall
and the medical center...
Move!
Constantino.
He's on the radio.
Constantino, you son of a bitch,
what the hell are you doing?
<i>I'm sorry for your troubles.
We got a dozen injured people
on the street here.
<i>I warned you what would happen
if you didn't meet our demands.
Demands?
I will make it my,
my purpose in life
to see that you are held accountable
for what you've just done.
<i>Take another hour...
Do not fire any more
of those things in here!
<i>One hour, Gray.
<i>We need seven farms.
<i>It was just two mortars this time.
<i>Next time there'll be three.
Try to retaliate,
or refuse our demands,
we'll send more.
We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.
The patrols said that it looked like
they were fired from the west.
Get as many rangers as you can,
all right, go out there,
find those mortars.
And we are gonna take them out!
Move!
Come on.
- Darcy, are you okay ?
- Yeah, but what happened ?
It's New Bern.
They're firing mortars at us.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!
Look, we've got to get the kids
and you got to get out of here.
Where are we going to go?
There's a safe house I know of.
If we could just get there.
It's in Montana.
Go to Montana on these roads?
What are our chances
of getting there?
I don't know.
- You heard from Constantino?
- No, no, but I...
sent out a squad of rangers
to try to take out the mortars.
I should have been with them.
You weren't here,
and I couldn't wait.
What should we do?
I don't know.
We've got to get underground, now.
Everybody!
You have got to get underground.
You, get everybody underground.
Let's go home.
Let's go home.
Okay.
I have to get back to town.
Sam, get away fromhere.
Dad, there's more water in the garage.
You want me to get it?
That is the safest room
in the house.
It's concrete, rebar, reinforced.
That's where we should be, D.
Come on.
Come on in.
This is cool!
Sam, Allison, go in the other room.
- Why can't...
- Come on, Sam. Let's go.
But this room's boring.
No more secrets.
Those mortars didn't come
from very far off.
- How much time do we have?
- About four minutes left.
<i>This is Stanley Richmond.
Mayor Anderson, can you hear me?
- We hear you.
- <i>Okay,
<i>we're about 100 yards away
from the mortar cannons.
<i>There's two of them,
sitting on the back of a flatbed truck.
Where are you, Stanley?
<i>We're in the woods
by the old </i>Shaw Creek Bridge,
<i>about two miles west of town.
<i>There's out ten men
guarding the truck.
- <i>They're arked in a clearing.</i>
- Can you get to them?
<i>Yeah, I think so. There's a path
leading into the clearing.
Tell him he's got to send scouts out
on both flanks.
There's no time to reposition.
They have to know
what they're going into.
I'm not gonna give them
another chance to drop bombs on us.
Gray, these men are not soldiers...
Johnston, you can stay or you can go,
but how this happens is my call.
- Stanley, get out of there. Don't do!
- Let go!
<i>What should we do?
Take 'em out.
<i>Got it.
So why now?
You know I always thought
that I could keep you safe.
But now, uh, today...
I'm just not so sure.
Nothing is safe.
Not anymore.
But, you know, in...
in the middle of all of this...
in this madness...
the only thing that make sense to me,
I mean really, the...
only thing...
is you and the kids.
It took me a while to realize
that and I'm...
sorry.
I am...
so sorry.
I missed you.
I missed you.
How do we know if it worked?
Come on.
Is he shot?
Sit down. Sit down.
Get him to the med center.
Is he all right?
Are you shot?
Where's everybody else?
Stanley, what happened out there?
I don't know.
We were moving
towards the mortar truck
and they were waiting,
they were waiting
on both sides of it for us.
They wouldn't...
they wouldn't stop firing.
Stanley, where's everybody else?
Where are they, son?
They're...
they're all dead.
They're all dead.
This is insane.
This is insane!
You son of a bitch!
Back off. Hold on.
Hold on.
Bailey's... now.
Stanley said the mortars were
on trucks here,
right here, just east
of Shaw Creek Bridge.
They're going to fire and move.
Check the tracks, see which
direction they were headed.
And Jake, just scout them.
We're not not going to do
anything else half-cocked.
First, we find 'em, then
we'll formulate a plan of attack.
Got it.
Just scout 'em.
I'm coming with you.
It was not a request.
All right.
From the tracks, I'd say three,
maybe four trucks
headed down that fire road.
They could hit the town from anywhere
once they get to Route 6.
Hawkins spotted a five-ton truck
coming this way from New Bern
about three miles back
Could be a supply truck
heading to the next mortar site.
We can get it.
All right. Let's go.
Stop the truck now!
Stop it!
They're all right.
Let 'em go.
You two finally turned to
a life of crime.
We're going to need
your men, Dale.
My men don't fight for
Gray Anderson.
We're asking you
to help defend the town.
We lose, you don't have anything.
If we fight with you,
we keep Mrs. Herbert's farm.
And we get the abandoned
Surrey farm also.
You already own half a salt mine,
and a percentage of every farm
in the county. Now you want more?
- It's just business.
- This isn't about business.
I'm asking you to do this for me.
We need your help.
Let's get ready to move.
They'll be looking for this truck.
Last time I was in town,
those people were trying to lynch me.
They can all go to hell.
Just listen to me.
No, you listen to me.
I've been watching New Bern
moving weapons
and supplies around here
for the last three days.
This is going to be a bloodbath.
The best thing you can do
is come with me.
Jericho's my home.
And I'm your father.
It's survival of the fastest
and strongest out here.
You think I'm safer with you,
robbing trucks?
I haven't lost a man yet.
And if New Bern doesn't get Jericho,
somebody else will.
Come with me.
Give us the maps,
help us take out the mortars,
help us fight.
We'll give you half.
Half of all weapons,
food and fuel that we take.
And if New Bern's army's as
big as you say it is,
you'll do whole lot better than
hitting one truck at a time out here.
You got more of me in you
than you're ever going to admit.
Change of plans!
When the federal government
comes back, we have our deeds.
We get our farms back then.
What if the government
doesn't come back?
What if this is the way it stays?
But they are coming here
intent on killing us.
Gray says we're only
three farms away from a deal.
And besides,
we're not prepared to fight.
I will get us prepared.
You talk to those farmers,
you don't let them give in.
Who else you got willing
to fight, Johnston?
The cops?
The rangers?
Dad?
There are 11 potential mortar sites.
Question is, which one is next?
Driver said... this one.
If we can trust him.
How were the trucks guarded?
- They have men hidden in the brush.
- I'm not sure I'm taking your deal.
They have nearly 30 guys guarding
that mortar truck.
I see nine here.
Gray's got the seven farmers he needs.
He's going to call New Bern
and give them up.
Surrenders those farms,
New Bern will occupy them in 30 minutes.
We'll never get rid of them.
So, what do we do?
I guess I'm about to make
a deal with the devil.
You flatter me.
get back over to town hall,
do whatever it takes,
but don't let Gray make that call.
What do you mean, do whatever
it takes? What are you saying?
I'm saying it's time to pick a side.
Why'd you bring Grey in here?
They just want to talk
to you for a second.
Don't make that deal
with Constantino.
It's not a debate.
If you make this deal, they're not
going to stop with seven farms.
People are going to starve
to death, Gray.
And that's if they don't kill us
outright when the food gets scarce.
I need you to leave.
- Now!
- Come on, Gray.
Why are you so ready to give up?
I almost gave my life
for this town, Gray.
You better listen to me,
you understand?
- It wasn't your fault those men died.
- Get 'em out of here!
Get them out of here!
You're going to listen
to what I have to say.
It's not your fault.
Calm down!
Put 'em down!
Put 'em down!
We have men out there, Gray.
What?
We have men out there.
Put 'em down!
- Brooks, put 'em down!
- You, too. Put 'em down..
Who is out there ?
Who is out there and
what are they doing?
Jake, Hawkins, my dad.
And they're going to try
and take out the mortars.
The three of them?
What do they think they're going to do?
You cannot give up those farms.
- Do you understand?
- We can't fight!
We can't fight.
You saw what happened this morning.
We're not ready for this.
I have been talking to Constantino,
and I promised him that
we will not retaliate
if he just gives us time
to put this deal together.
We've got maps of all
of New Bern's positions.
- Supply line, everything.
- Where did you get this stuff?
We've got trucks. We've got fuel.
We've got guns.
What are you talking about?
Where did you get all this?
Jonah Prowse is fighting with us.
He's got about 30 men
fighting with him. 30 men!
Well, they can get us all killed.
<i>This is New Bern. Over.
Don't go near that radio, Gray.
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?
Johnston Green, right?
Two years ago,  you came over
to New Bern and finished fourth
in a bass fishing contest
up at Big Hill Lake.
I finished second.
Let's go.
<i>Mayor Anderson,
your time is running out.
She tried to tell Constantino
that I did not send them out there.
Gray, don't make that deal.
Buy some time to take out those mortars.
Negotiate with Constantino.
So, we pop out of here,
it gets bad, Jonah going
will have our backs, right?
You are filling me
with confidence, Jake.
Emily's with him.
He'll be there.
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here, Phil.
<i>What's your decision?
You're a good businessman, Gray.
You know how to do it.
Well, we don't want to fight.
So,
what about the... Levine
and Hides Dairy farms,
in-instead of the Richmond farm?
<i>That's less acreage.
Yeah, I know, but...
then you would have a dairy
and a soybean farm,
and also Hides has 50 acres of corn,
and I got to tell you, that deal would
be a lot easier to sell to my people.
Where you been?
Supposed to be here three hours ago.
I got sniped at by
a gang over near Calvert.
Had to come all the way back around
through... back through Van Ness.
Got a half a barbecued venison in back.
You're kidding?
God, we need it.
We got chow!
We'll eat in shifts.
Don't pull everybody off
the perimeter at the same time.
Don't move.
And drop your weapons.
Get in the truck.
Move!
<i>My people are telling me
that all the cattle out
<i>at Hides farm have been
slaughtered for food.
Really?
I don't think so, but
I can find out for you.
Let's talk about the salt mine now.
You've already got 25% of the mine.
Can't we just leave it at that?
<i>What are you doing, Gray?
What are you talking about?
<i>This negotiation is over.
No, Phil, come on.
<i>30 seconds, Gray,
or I send more mortars.
We almost have a deal here, Phil.
Come on!
They're here!
They're in the camp!
I'm closing the camp!
Come on. Get up there!
Where the hell is Jonah?
He doesn't want to get hit
in our crossfire.
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Stop!
This one's yours.
Meet you back at the camp.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
Deal's changed.
The hell it has.
It's a new split:
I get all the weapons, the food,
the fuel, the guns, everything.
- Deal's 50-50.
- And what do we get?
You get to have bombs
not falling on your head.
Listen here, Jonah...
This is about to get a lot worse.
We need those guns!
Why are you doing this?
You owe me a lot more than that!
I am a thief, not a soldier.
You promised you'd help us.
Look, you shouldn't be near me.
You're a schoolteacher, kid.
A schoolteacher.
Go on.
We're just gonna let him go?
We need those guns.
Guns.
Guns are easy.
You had this the whole time
and you didn't say anything?
I never thought I was gonna call
this town my home.
Let's get them loaded up.
What's he doing?
Why hasn't he fired the mortars?
Did we take them out?
He would have come back
on the radio.
We took out the mortars.
Hell, yeah.
<i>Are you there?
<i>Now, you've brought this on yourself.
<i>There's no deals, no mercy.
<i>We're coming.
<i>This means war.
<i>Do you hear me, Gray?
I need your help.
Stanley, get me every
runner you can find.
I want to get orders out
to all the patrols.
Most of you have no idea what to do
or what's coming.
Some of you do.
This isn't a fight about land
or about this town.
This is a fight for our very existence.
Pray for each other.
While you're at it, pray for the men
and women of New Bern.
Pray that God forgives us.
Every able-bodied person...
who needs a gun...
16 years of age or older...
line up.

<i>Previously on </i>Jericho
Oh, my God... Ted !
We grew up together over in New Bern.
- You just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No. The question is, how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
They get tired of you being sheriff?
<i>Can we buy some more of these things?
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, we'll give you the food.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They slid it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.
Where's Heather?
She's dead, Jake.
Everybody go!
<i>Jericho is about to be invaded.
<i>We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.
Most of you have no idea of
what's coming.
This isn't a fight about land.
This is a fight for our very existence.
I know this has great artistic merit,
but...
i'm taking these shoes off
in ten minutes.
So, if you don't want
to have to hide my toes...
Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable.
We can't really do this
without the best man anyway.
Where is Jake?
I don't see him.
Grandpa seems to be missing, too.
Take a wild guess where they are.
Right.
Oh, Beth.
It's so nice to see you, dear.
I need your help.
We need to go over
to the medical center.
- Is everyone in there?
- Yeah. We're just waiting for you.
How is it going out there?
They took Talbot's farm.
How many men?
I'd say 60... 70.
That's probably just
an advance team.
I would imagine they got more than that
up the road in reserve.
Constantino has us outnumbered
and outgunned.
If we split our force, and try
to defend each one of these farms,
he's goino toverwhelm us.
So what are you saying?
I'm saying we don't split up.
We choose a place to stand together,
deliver a good, hard counterpunch.
Let them know that,
if they intend to take from us,
it's going to cost them dearly.
How?
Well, right here.
Stanley Richmond's farm.
It's the last place
before this road divides,
and they start taking ground
faster than we can keep up.
Plus which it's the highest point
in the whole area.
There's where we make our stand.
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.
He told the farm is secured.
Let's go get the rest of them.
Let's go!
This one's alive.

<i>6 YEARS AGO
- Grandpa, you're drunk.
- Yeah!
Thank you, darling
Keep 'em coming.
Gail's going to get so mad at you
for getting her boy drunk.
I've got Gail wrapped
around my little finger.
Says the guy who taught me
to fly his crop duster when I was 13,
then told Mom I was lying
when I mentioned it.
I was so jealous.
My mom knew that you let him fly,
and she wouldn't let me go
anywhere near you.
You see, Jake would...
Jake would come over and tell me
all the stories you told him.
I loved...
I loved the one about the peanuts.
What the hell are you talking about?
The peanuts in World War II.
He means the "Nuts" story, Grandpa.
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.
So what's the story?
Tell me the story, somebody.
What? It's his story.
All right.
World War II.
The winter of 1944.
The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines,
and surrounded...
a division of Americans
in a little town called Bastogne,
freezing, starving and running out
of ammunition, but they knew...
that they had to hold that ground.
Just before Christmas,
the Nazis sent a note
to the American commander
telling him that he could
surrender and save the rt of his men,
or they could stay and fight.
The American commander
sent a one-word reply
to the Wehrmacht commander,
and it said...
- ... "Nuts."
Why did he say, "Nuts"?
It means, "Go to hell!"
Why didn't he just say, "Go to hell"?
Because he said, "Nuts. "
Gail, my sweetheart,
you look beautiful.
Save it, Dal.
Was it your idea
to get my son drunk tonight?
Right. Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.
- Come on.
- But I'm hammered.
And I want to talk to you.
Have a cup of coffee, Stanley.
Here.
Well, what's this?
As your brother's best man,
you are required to give a toast,
so I wrote down a few thoughts,
some things that
you might want to say.
You think I was going to wing it?
Let's go take some pictures, okay?
What's going on?
Mr. Green, I have access
to a keyhole military satellite
that I can use to track New Bern's
movements in the field today.
- Beg pardon?
- It's real.
The one restriction...
is that no one can know
where you're getting this information.
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field,
tell them what you want...
but the satellite must remain a secret.
Sounds good.
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?
I get it. Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.
- But...
- I am about to go to war,
with New Bern, Kansas,
the home of the nearest Costco.
Today is already just about
as weird as I can handle.
I'm not asking any more questions.
Mom, Dad,
there's a chance we may have
to leave here today,
and we might not be able
to make it back, so...
I just wanted to...
We just...
wanted to pay our respects.
Remember I told you about that witch,
from the IRS?
The one that wanted
to take everything
you've ever worked for?
Mom, Dad...
this is Mimi.
Hello.
It's nice to finally meet you.
I really love your son.
And, of course,
Bonnie is...
she's just wonderful.
And I've really enjoyed
living with them and...
- Oh, great.
- What?
I didn't say we were living together.
We're not married.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly... I...
Is everything a joke to you?
I figure one day we're going
to be buried here ourselves,
and I...
think it would be nice if...
our kids came and,
and joked around with us.
I hope that's not
for a really long time.
How we doing?
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.
We got more coming, right?
They're trickling in. It's taking
a lot longer than we thought.
Saying good-bye to their families.
Get on down to the pass.
Get everybody organized.
We don't have a whole lot of time
before their advance unit hits.
- Not you.
- Why not?
Because these people
elected you their leader.
We protect you at all costs.
And, besides, in a few minutes,
I'm going to need your help.
Help with what?
Arming our tank.
Our daughter is out there carrying
a rifle and... I'm in here.
Sam needs you here.
You know, Allie's safe.
She's been assigned to Town Hall,
and the fighting is miles from there.
Right now, there really isn't
anything else you can be doing.
Here we go.
<i>Jake, you are about
to have company.
Already?
<i>New Bern is on its way.
There are...
<i>70, maybe... 80 men.
Is that tank there yet?
They're trying to load it
with that mortar round right now.
I think you're gonna need it.
All right, let's get ready!
They're coming!
Get some ammo down here!
What is it?
I'm being tracked.
Tracked?
What do you mean?
Someone is trying to trace my location
through the satellite.
- Well, can they?
- If they have time, yes.
Do you know who it is?
My guess is, it's... Valente.
What him?
From... Homeland Security?
I don't know who he's working for now,
but he told Sarah
to get the bomb any way she could
and to eliminate all witnesses.
All the witnesses.
- Shut it down.
- No, I can't.
We just have to make sure we disconnect
the feed before he finishes the trace.
I don't get it.
- Why are they just standing there?
- I don't know.
Do we fire the first shot?
New Bern's here.
Get into position.
We're gonna need that tank.
Having a good time?
By the way, I think I saw April
making out with Shep Cale.
All right, all right.
You need to stop drinking.
Listen.
Read this.
It's a speech.
Figure you should have something ready,
so you don't embarrass yourself.
You mean so I don't embarrass you,
because you don't have to worry.
Is that how you spell
"venereal disease"?
This day is important to me, okay?
Just because your life's a big joke
doesn't mean you have
to treat mine that way.
Why is my life a joke?
- Just read the speech.
- No, seriously, Eric,
why is my life a joke?
- I'm not getting into this right now.
All right.
You think people don't wonder
what you've been doing?
You spend all that time
in flight school getting your license.
Instead of using it,
you come back here,
hanging out like it's the summer
after high school.
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.
If I'm such a joke,
then why'd you want me as your best man?
You didn't want me, did you?
No, not really.
Where's that tank?
We're not going to last long
against those trucks.
We have to hold out.
Damn it!
- Got to keep drawing their fire,
all right?  - Got It.
Give me another mag.
Where are you going?
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill...
and shot on the gunner.
- I got your back.
- All right.
Cover him!
Why eliminate witnesses?
I mean, whoever's tracking you,
they either...
want to use the bomb
for themselves or...
they want to keep you
from using it, but...
either way,
what difference do witnesses make?
The bombs have fingerprints,
don't they? Something that...
make them traceable.
I remember reading that.
It's the uranium.
It has...
It has a specific signature.
It places the origin of the device
where it was made.
So there were dozens of these things
used in the attacks, right?
And now you have the last one.
I don't think these people are looking
at this thing as a weapon.
It's more than that.
It's...
Evidence.
It's the smoking gun
behind the greatest crime
in the history of the world.
The bomb...
it could expose the people...
who were responsible for the attacks.
That's why they need it back.
Did u see what I just did?
Holy crap.
That was...
<i>Holy crap!
All right, that bought us some time.
But they'll be back,
and there'll be more of them.
And it won't be near as easy
next time.
Easy?
You thought that was easy?
Dad?
What's wrong?
Clear the table!
Clear it!
- Clear it!
- I'm gonna go get Kenchy.
- Get my mom!
- We'll need towels.
And some antiseptic,
and some alcohol.
- We need alcohol.
- Get a towel!
Get me some alcohol!
Here we go.
Give me that, come on!
Okay, all right.
Keep the pressure on.
What?
Keep it on! Keep the pressure.
<i>Jake, come in.
Nice work out there.
<i>Tell your father that
they're coming back around.
He's been shot.
I'm sorry.
You know what to do, right?
<i>Keep pressure on the wound,
<i>and there should be some morphine
syrettes in the... supplies I gave you.
Yeah, we've got it.
Listen, Jake.
<i>People are gonna be
looking to you now.
<i>You know what I mean?
Okay, the guys will be back.
They retreated to Talbot's farm.
<i>My guess is,
they're waiting for reinforcements,
<i>so you should have a little time
to regroup out there.
<i>Just keep the radio close,
and I'll update you.
Out.
Out.
Please, I need to talk
whoever's in charge.
Right over there.
Excuse me, sir?
Colonel Hoffman.
You don't have to call me sir,
unless you plan to enlist.
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.
It's planning to overrun the town
of Jericho. People are gonna get killed.
They tried to kill me,
but I got away.
- You've got to help these people.
- Where is this?
Kansas, not far from
the Colorado border.
I wish I could help. My orders are
to secure the roads in this area.
- But, sir...
- I don't get to make these decisions.
I'm just a government employee.
Which government?
United States.
Are you all right, ma'am?
We heard there were six different people
claiming the presidency.
There were. In fact, there are still
a couple of holdouts...
Texas, a bloc in the East.
The new federal government's
been restored in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Colonel, this is an emergency.
You have to go to Jericho. The fighting
could be happening right now.
I am very sorry, ma'am.
Casper, you see she gets back
to the medical unit.
Come on, ma'am.
Get 'em out.
Get 'em out.
Clear everyone out.
You listen...
This place,
is where you survive.
You make a stand here,
you hear?
We will.
I'm sorry you have to see this.
You've been through enough.
Dad...
Dad, stop.
You're stronger than you think
you are, though.
Always have been.
I love you, son.
I guess I zigged when I should've
zagged out there, huh?
I sure wish your mother was here.
She's coming.
She'll be here.
Tell your mother I love her.
I was... hard on you.
I pushed you... away.
I'm glad you... came... home.
I'm proud of you.
The big toast.
Before I start,
is there anyone who...
hasn't written me a speech?
It really makes me wonder
how screwed up you think I am
that I can't be trusted
to say a few things...
about my brother.
The thing is...
these are all pretty lame.
Not one of them mentions
my brother's musical theater phase
when we all thought he was gay.
Seriously.
You have not heard disturbing
until you've heard him singing
"One Hand, One Heart"
in the shower every morning.
I tease my brother a lot,
but...
the truth is...
the truth is I'm very proud of him.
I'm...
I'm proud of how kind he is...
I'm proud of how giving he is,
and...
he's a very lucky man.
Really.
My father's dead.
We'll get through.
Get Gray back to town.
What?
Wait a minute...
Come tomorrow,
what's left of us will need a leader.
I think we've lost enough
in that department for one day.
We're gonna need
every set of hands we can get.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're too important now, Gray.
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.
And start getting everyone
into position.
Who knows when
they're gonna come back again?
Go ahead.
<i>So they got their reinforcements.
<i>It's a couple hundred men.
<i>And another six of those
deuce and a halfs.
<i>They're mobilizing now,
so I say you got about 15,
<i>maybe 20 minutes
before they're on you.
You get back here as soon as you can.
All right?
Say, what do you know about
a set of train tracks
running alongside the river?
Why?
What do you see?
<i>Hawkins, what's on the tracks?
I don't know. I can't see.
- Hang on.
- Robert, disconnect it.
Jake, you got a very large train
coming from New Bern,
<i>and they've got three cargo cars.
<i>What's in them?
I think it's men,
and there's hundreds of them.
It's a whole set of reinforcement...
Hawkins, what's going on?
Talk to me.
<i>I'm on my way.
I've got to go.
Wait.
Look, they only had a few seconds.
It wasn't enough time
to get an exact location.
- We're fine for a little while.
- Where are you going?
I have to stop a train.
I-80 is secured
from Cheyenne to Grand Island.
We now control the area
between Kearney and Hastings.
I-70 is turning out to be a challenge.
There are organized road gangs
controlling much of the interstate.
I've also been told by a patient
in our medical unit
to expect a significant skirmish
between two towns
in northwest Kansas:
New Bern and Jericho.
<i>What is the location of those towns?
CZ-12, Quadrant Four.
<i>We've tracked the terror suspect
to within 200 miles of that area.
<i>Capture of this suspect
is a top priority
<i>for President Tomarchio
and the administration.
<i>Do you understand?
- Should I re-prioritize, sir?
- <i>Immediately.
Go to Jericho and crush the skirmish.
Once the area's clear,
we will begin our search
for the terrorist.
I'm gonna ask Mimi to marry me.
Yeah?
Yeah. She can't cook,
she's never seen nine innings
of baseball in her life,
she hates my clothes...
but I love her.
And I'm happy.
Jake, I don't want to die today.
You're gonna make it out of here.
That I promise.
Constantino and those trucks
are right on your doorstep.
You don't have much time.
What about that train?
20 minutes, give or take.
Tell me you have a plan,
a really good one.
I need to borrow your tank.
It won't fire.
I told you that, right?
There's not a single
round of ammo in it.
I'm not planning on shooting anything.
The throttle's there on your left.
And to steer, you're just gonna...
Hey. This is not my first time.
Good luck out there.
You, too.
Any minute now, huh?
I'm...
You know, he's here...
watching.
You know that, right?
They still doing
the bunny hop in there?
I think it's the Macarena.
The what?
Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop.
Quite a speech you made in there.
I had no idea you were
such a sentimental fool.
Mom wrote it.
You think?
Listen, I know that you and Eric
aren't close and...
maybe you didn't feel like standing up
in front of a bunch of people and...
acting like you were.
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing
and doing what needs to be done
are two different things.
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.
I'm fine.
I somehow get the feeling
my worrying days are far from over.
But they will be one day.
One day, I know you're gonna become
the man I know you can be,
the man you were born to be.
My God, that day's gonna be
something to see.
Come on, Johnston.
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.
Me and the old man are gonna
head down to the lake
and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?
Yeah. I'm just gonna...
wait for Emily, say good night.
I'll...
meet you there.
I'll save you a place.
- Where's he going?
- Waiting for Emily, say good night.
That's the last we'll see
of him tonight.
Dad...
If I had a girl that looked like that,
I wouldn't keep her waiting.
You hear that, boy?
I'm gonna take that girl
away from you.
You talk a good game.
You better watch out
for yourself, too.
Your wife is crazy about me.
Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory
switch to you three times a day.
It's Constantino.
I'm here.
<i>My scouts just informed me.
<i>I am sorry about your father.
You're outmanned,
and you're outgunned.
There's too many of us and
we are too desperate to give up.
You cannot win this.
I'm giving you one last chance.
<i>Walk away,
put your guns down...
Walk away,
put your guns down...
and return to town,
and no one else will be harmed.
Jake, I need an answer.
What's it gonna be?
Nuts.
Sorry, I didn't get that.
You can go straight to hell.
About my father...
you're the one I'm coming for.
I want to go home.
Our orders are to take people
out of the conflict zone.
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.
Colonel Hoffman?
What is all this?
- Sir, wheels up in five minutes.
- Roger that.
- Jericho's been moved up to priority #1
on the list.  - Thank you.
Oh, God, thank you.
This is all thanks to you.
Don't worry. We're gonna get things
back to normal again.
All right, saddle up.
My father expected us
to make a stand here.
To defend our home.
That's what we're gonna do.
Smoke bombs!
Get in position!
Don't waste your rounds!
Wait for a clean shot!
Wait...
Wait...
Wait...
Now!

Previously on Jericho.
<i>So I hear you and I
are going to be partners now.</i>
<i>Where'd you get that?</i>
<i>You're running the store,
you're going to need protection.</i>
<i>Don't make the same mistake
that Gracie made.</i>
<i>Or those people out there
are going to be putting</i>
<i>flowers and candles
on the sidewalk for you.</i>
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>
<i>Remember,
the gas tank on this thing</i>
<i>is on the left-hand side,</i>
<i>so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you,</i>
<i>make sure it's not on that side.</i>
<i>Okay. Anything else?</i>
<i>So, are we going to see you
for Thanksgiving?</i>
<i>Well, I think Mary and I
are going to spend it together.</i>
<i>Well, you're always welcome.</i>
<i>Thanks, but I don't want to put
you guys in an awkward position.</i>
<i>You could have thought of that before
you moved in with your mistress</i>
<i>and left your wife with us.</i>
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>
<i>that landed in the middle of nowhere.</i>
<i>They've been walking for weeks.</i>
<i>They must have gone through hell.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Is it really you?</i>
<i>I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while</i>
<i>until I can sort something out.</i>
<i>Are we in danger, Robert?</i>
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>
<i>You need to keep them
clean and warm.</i>
<i>Do you have a place to stay?</i>
<i>Do you know anyone in Jericho?</i>
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>I do.</i>
It's freezing in here, too.
Mr. Bintner?
Mr. Bintner?
Joe?
The temperature dropped so fast.
It's going to be a long winter.
All right, everyone!
Everyone, please!
Please!
Right now,
we're using the generator
to power the town hall
for three hours a day,
and the Med Center for six.
And this is how much fuel we have,
and this is how much we need
to get us through the winter.
At current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel
in two weeks.
I wonder when the dancing girls show up.
Stop.
There's a way of doing this without
scaring the crap out of everybody.
He was elected.
Guess he's going to do it his way.
I'm going to need a hobby.
So here's what we're working on.
All right, we got
organized firewood crews...
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Yeah.
There's a woman
in that group of refugees
that Bill is processing,
I think you should talk to her.
Why?
She said she used to be
a cop in Saint Louis.
Especially with 53
new people among us,
we have got to start rethinking things,
fast,
or the people we lost last night
won't be the only casualties
of this coming winter.
What about the windmills?
She's right.
Wind power.
We should be building windmills.
Harry?
I think you all know Harry Carmichael,
our chief engineer
down at the mine.
We've been looking into wind turbines
for weeks now with Mayor Green.
But in order to build anything
that can be connected to the grid,
it's going to take time.
Time I'm not sure we can afford.
- She's in here.
- Thanks, Jimmy.
Hello, Rob.
Any parts we don't have...
we simply don't have
the maching capabilities.
What kind of parts?
Mechanical governors to regulate output.
With the EMP damage, we're figuring
out a lot of this from scratch.
- It's still a long way off.
- Black Jack Fairgrounds.
We walked through it
on our way back here.
It's become a trading post.
People from all over
the region are trading...
food, information,
machine parts.
They may have what we need.
That's got to be a 200-mile drive.
That's a lot of gas for a "maybe."
If we can get one windmill working,
we'd save that much gas in a month.
If we get enough of them,
we could be off gas for good.
It might not be a bad idea
to put a small party together
and go check it out.
Is anyone interested
in volunteering?
Season 1 - Episode 13
" Black Jack "
Transcript : swsub.com

[ www. seriessub.com ]
I know it was you.
- What?
- Those men that grabbed me.
They said that someone
on my team sold us all out.
They said it was you.
And you believe them?
Tell me why I shouldn't.
Come on!
You're smart enough to know
that they will say anything
to get you to talk.
Because you know
I owe you my life
as much as you owe me yours
and because you just...
You just punched me in the face,
and I didn't hit you back.
- Who else is here?
- No one.
Victor showed up
just after D-day.
But he only made it
for a couple of hours.
Did you kill him?
It was the radiation...
from Denver.
No one else made it back here
to the rally point?
You going to tell me
how you got out of that room?
Three armed guys, cuffs.
Three guys and cuffs
keep you in that room?
One of them got too close.
Then there was only two.
Two was easy.
From there,
I drove as fast as I could.
Saw the clouds
from D. C. and Baltimore.
Ran out of gas in West Virginia.
Went from refugee camp
to refugee camp
however I could.
I'm glad you made it.
You left me.
I know.
So what now?
We caught wind of some raiding parties
at interchanges here and here.
But if you're careful,
you should be safe
the rest of the way.
Once you're at Black Jack,
watch your back.
Thieves?
It's not the thieves you got
to worry about, it's the guards.
They've got a reputation
of being really ruthless.
Without the cops
or the National Guard,
it's the only way they
guaranteed it's safe enough
to keep commerce going there.
You'd better take two or three
of the border patrol guys with you.
Just in case you run
into any surprises.
I'm coming, too.
Not a chance in hell.
Would you know
a working mechanical governor
for a wind turbine
if you saw one?
I'm not taking
passengers out there.
Jake, Mr. Carmichael has a family.
I can help.
You need me.
Mrs. Green?
What?
Eric told me that
April's pregnant.
I just...
- If there's anything that I can do...
- Mary...
I think you've done quite enough.
Always got to be the first one
to jump in the fire, don't you?
Somebody's got to go.
Yeah, well, just seems
that someone is always you.
Gray's having a few bags of salt
packed up for us to trade.
Smart.
Who else is going?
Apparently Heather.
Gray thinks I should take
a couple of guys from border patrol.
That's it?
I'm not so sure
pulling them off patrol
just to watch my back
is such a good idea.
Besides, only a handful of them
even know what they're doing.
You don't think
I can watch your back?
Why? You want to go?
Look, you've already seen
what it's like out there. I just...
need to see it for myself.
Besides, I'm unemployed.
I'm not obsolete.
Did you ask Mom?
Son, I am 59 years old.
I was mayor of this town
since the Carter administration.
I'm a retired U. S. Army Ranger
and a combat veteran.
Of course I asked your mother.
I could go downstairs and...
warm some water
for a bath for you.
I didn't think I was ever
going to finish this.
Hey, uh...
we have a guest.
This is Sarah.
Hey, Dale?
Hey. What are you
doing back there?
Uh, inventory.
Is it that bad?
Well, Mr. Houghton just showed up
with Mrs. Leigh's cut of the produce.
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, exactly.
Well, did you point out
that it's rotten?
They're all screwing me.
Hardly anyone's honoring their deals.
My dad used to have to deal with stuff
like this all the time
down at the salt mine.
- Well, how did he do it?
- He just...
did whatever it took
to keep things running.
I'm not shutting this place down.
Actually,
I may have
good news about that.
But you might have
to take a little trip.
I need to talk to you.
All right.
I shouldn't have sprung this on you.
This is too weird...
What? What's weird?
I kissed you.
A month ago.
And we haven't spoken since.
Generally, people speak
after something like that.
I'm just going to...
You know...
I know, I'm, uh...
- I'm sorry, really...
- You don't have to apologize.
I'm not upset.
I understand
why it happened.
Look, I want to go
because I think I can help get
this place back up on its feet.
That's it.
It's not a date.
Mr. Mayor?
I'm not the mayor anymore, Dale.
What is it?
I need to come with you.
I want to take it all.
Trade it for something
I can actually use
to build this store up again.
Whatever I don't use,
I'll put towards
supplies the town needs.
You're just going to give it
away to the town for nothing?
It's the right thing to do, isn't it?
I just want to help.
Well,
this is one hell of a crew
we're putting together here.
All right.
Yeah, we'll leave
first thing in the morning.
You just happen to know
someone who just...
happened to wander into town?
Look at me.
I'm not going to lie to you.
But I can't...
I can't tell you any more
than I already have.
So she's a friend, okay?
The last time you let someone
from that part of your life
- into our home, it was 4 years ago.
- This is different.
Well, you couldn't tell me
who he was.
But you told me not to worry.
Two weeks later, you left.
I didn't see you again
until two months ago.
This is different.
Sam cried for weeks.
I mean, he was four-years-old.
He didn't understand why
you'd want to leave him.
I just...
I don't know if I can watch him
go through that again.
What is going on here?
Come here.
What is this?
So I'm being watched.
By who?
My guess...
The Old Man.
Why...?
You still have the package, don't you?
He's been coordinating
this thing from the beginning,
feeding us information.
Why would he turn on us now?
I don't know.
You still have
a way to reach him?
And have you...
told him that you
made contact with me yet?
- Not yet.
- Then do it.
You do it...
and you see what he says.
"Thieves will be strung up."
We need your guns.
Pick them up on the way out.
Go ahead.
They're kidding about
the "strung up" thing, right?
They don't mean that literally.
Looks like everyone
checks in here at the main tent.
They try and match
buyers and sellers.
They gave me three
possibilities of sellers
that might have the part
for the windmill.
It's like eBay.
Not like eBay.
All right, look, um...
see if you can find the governor,
I'm going to stick with Dale.
See what he can trade for.
Let's do this thing quick
then we're out of here.
Morning.
Good morning.
Last night,
you fell asleep mid-sentence.
- I did?
- Yes, you did.
Standing up right there
at the sink, shaving.
You were going to tell me
what you've seen out there and...
Roger, I...
I don't want to push.
I can't even imagine how awful
it was for you out there. I just...
A lot of it was.
Listen.
If I tell you something,
will you promise not to think...
I've lost it?
Of course.
Out there...
I saw... something.
I haven't told
anybody about it. I...
can't explain it.
The thing is...
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
From there I ended up
in a tent city outside of Lexington.
So, what are they like?
The camps?
Each is, uh... different.
Some are overcrowded, dangerous.
Some are better run.
Did you see people
with radiation poisoning?
Some, yes.
What do they look like?
Lots of burns,
tissue loss, some vomiting.
Allie, Sam.
Upstairs.
How do you know my dad?
We worked together.
Do you know how
to play football?
Of course, I do.
Doesn't everybody?
Not everybody.
Hey, Samuel, now.
Come on.
You know, these kids
have been through enough.
I... I'm sorry.
Look, I don't know you.
I really don't want to.
I know the kind of people
my husband works with.
No matter how close
the two of you are,
I don't need my kids
exposed to that world.
I've been married to
this man a long time.
I got pretty good at reading
between the lines.
Thanks, Mary.
Why don't you and I sit down
together and have a drink?
Hey, how much?
- Beg pardon?
- How much?
How much for what?
I don't know.
An hour?
An hour of what?
Wait, what?! No!
- How about a half hour?
- Is everything all right?
- I'm not a hooker, pal!
- Then what are you doing here?
All right, that's enough.
That's enough, man.
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey, no. No.
No problem. Everything's fine.
No kidding, buddy.
You don't want to mess with
the guards here, it gets ugly, fast.
Thanks for the help.
Heather.
Oh, my God, Ted.
I can't believe you're here.
Jake, this is Ted Lewis.
We grew up together
over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
I was so worried about you.
We were going to send a party
to make contact with you guys,
but the roads were
just so dangerous.
What are you guys doing here?
We're looking for parts
for a windmill generator.
Unsuccessfully.
Hey, there's a guy
we deal with here...
who doesn't always
report to the main tent,
but sometimes he's got
those specialty items
nobody else has.
You want to see him?
- Yeah, let's check it out.
- All right.
Get this stuff out of here
before somebody sees it.
Why, what's wrong with it?
Nickel...
the silver stuff
is all alloyed with it.
So?
So nickel absorbs radioactivity.
Stuff that's been looted
from hot zones
is making a lot of people sick.
No one wants it.
This stuff was nowhere
near the fallout.
Look, kid,
if I can't sell it, I can't sell it.
What do you want me to tell you?
What else do you got?
So what does have value here?
Not much of what you got.
Check the board over there.
Why salt?
It's a preservative.
An antibiotic.
You need 1,500 milligrams
of it a day to survive.
The Romans actually
used it as currency.
Whole African empires
were based on the control
and supply of it.
Wars have been fought over salt.
Food, medical supplies,
a generator, all air-dropped,
all from China.
What?
Yeah, we got an airdrop, too.
The thing is...
it was from Germany.
It's aid. It must be coming
from all over the world.
Well, if aid's coming
from all over the world then...
who did this to us?
A group of thugs a few weeks back,
guys claiming to be
government contractors.
So the mayor thought
we should make security a priority.
He resigned his office and...
appointed Sheriff Constantino
acting city manager.
The contractors,
who were they?
A security detail from a...
company called Ravenwood.
They came in looking for supplies.
A few of the shop owners resisted
and they got violent.
They killed three,
they injured eight.
They drove off with
a truckload of our diesel.
But since then,
the sheriff's managed to
keep control of things.
Crime really isn't a
problem for us anymore.
How'd he manage that?
- What is this?
- The news.
Where does all this come from?
People pass through here
from all over.
Everyone brings
a little piece of the puzzle.
Do you have
something to write on?
You guys don't
get out much, do you?
It gets better.
What are the stars for?
Capitals.
Of what?
The federal government.
Federal government? But...
There are six stars up there.
Where's the president?
Which one?
Six presidents, I...
I don't understand.
Who's in charge of the military?
You're assuming
there's only one of those, too.
All right, come on, let's go.
Isn't there a line of succession,
so there's only one successor?
The word is HHS.
Secretary Charles is supposed
to be next in line,
but there are five other guys
who seem to think
the attacks changed the rules.
Senator Morrisette in Oregon,
Senator Tomarchio in Wyoming...
They're all staking a claim,
gathering support.
Then what happens?
How do they figure out who's in charge?
Either they start making deals,
- compromise...
- Or?
Or they fight.
Six bags of soybean seed,
and still it's...
It's not enough.
Maybe this whole thing
was a bad idea.
It's a start.
Dale, wait up.
It'd be a lot easier for you
to close the store, wouldn't it?
But instead, you're out here
trying to keep it going.
I think Gracie
would be proud of you.
I think your mom would
be proud of you, too.
When my mom died,
there was nothing I could do about it.
But then after Mrs. Leigh...
Mitchell Cafferty
is going to get his due
whether Gray finds him or not.
Sooner or later, he's going
to cross the wrong person.
One of these days,
it's going to catch up with him.
I don't like to drink
while I'm working.
To be honest, I have
difficulty understanding
how many ways I dislike you.
You made a list?
Mrs. Green, I don't think I...
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there
and listen to what
I have to say.
What you and Eric
did to April was awful.
But she's going
to get through this
because she is
one strong woman.
But there's a baby on the way,
and it happens
to be my grandchild.
And I intend to do
everything I can
to protect it from this world.
But what you've done,
I can't protect it from.
You've divided the family.
And as hard as that child's
life was going to be,
you have made it
so much more difficult.
I don't think that's something
I'll ever be able to forgive.
When I was a kid,
my mom split on my dad and I.
She left with the guy
she met in Denver...
This isn't about you.
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there
and listen to what I have to say.
I lay awake at night
terrified that I have
put April in the same
position my dad was in...
Terrified that I have put this child
in the same position that I was in.
My mistake was falling
in love with your son,
I never should have let
it happen, but I did.
I know the cost.
I know how wrong it is.
But the problem is,
he loves me, too.
And I don't know
how you undo that.
So if you want
to go on hating me,
if you never accept me...
I can't say as I blame you.
So I went to find help.
I was more messed up
than I thought.
I wandered for days.
Eventually...
passed out in this... field.
So there I was,
the middle of Nebraska
feeling like that was the place
I was going to die.
And then,
the strangest thing happened.
There was a...
light in the sky.
A bright light with a...
ring around it.
I...
went... towards it.
Two miles later...
I stumbled into
the refugee camp.
That light...
saved my life.
Been looking all over for you.
Did you find the part?
I think so.
Did you see the news?
You looking to trade
for a mechanical governor?
Okay, let's talk trade.
Eight bags of salt
at 35 pound per.
Russell, what did they think?
That they're the first ones
to think of this?
These parts are in high demand.
I'm not giving it away.
- What more is it going to take?
- What more?
I turned away a guy
just this morning,
and he offered 80 gallons
of diesel for the thing.
Listen...
We have more salt
than you can imagine.
We have the largest
salt mine for 400 miles
and we've got men to mine it.
But if you ever want
to see any of it,
we need to make
this deal right now, today.
You understand?
Okay, listen,
I'll vouch for him.
All right?
All right.
We got a deal.
Wait here. I'll go get it.
These things aren't
easy to make, you know.
Not the good ones anyway.
Dad, this is Russell.
Hi. Good to meet you.
Mr. Mayor?
No kidding, Dale,
I am not the mayor anymore.
There's blood on them.
- You need some help there?
- What the hell is this?
Are you conducting an inspection
or are we doing a deal?
No, we're not supporting that.
We'll find another solution.
Well, then we're all done here,
aren't we?
Why don't you get out?
Get out of here.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
You, too!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Guys, I'm so sorry.
We had no idea.
We need that part.
- And we're going to have to figure out
a way... - Where's Dale?
Dale, where'd you get off to?
Don't just wander off like that.
Did you steal that?
He's a bad guy.
He can't get away with that.
We got to get that back before
they realize it's missing.
It's okay I went out
the back. No one saw me.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hand him over.
He made a mistake, all right?
He'll give back what he took.
It's no harm done, all right?
Excuse me. You know,
he really is sorry and
the property is back
where it belongs.
He can explain it to management.
I'm just asking you,
use a little discretion,
that's all, please.
Excuse me, but could I talk
to whoever's in charge here?
Look, old man, I told you...
That's enough!
How long have you been
with the FBI?
14 years.
Started right out of college.
It's dangerous out there, isn't it?
I don't think your mom wants me
talking to you about that.
I'm not a kid.
It's pretty bad.
My dad's been teaching me
how to shoot.
I wonder if that's why.
He's been teaching you
how to shoot?
A little.
I'm not sure if I like it.
It's a weird feeling, but...
it's the first time I can remember
the two of us actually doing
something together.
Where's your father?
It's the old man.
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.
He knows where you are.
We need to go.
We need to move now.
No, I don't know.
You don't know?
This country is going
to be what we make of it.
There are only a
handful of other people
that know what we know.
We have to keep fighting.
We have to stay alive.
We go see him, and if,
if he is behind this,
we take him out.
Take him out?
Yeah, I mean,
how long can we run?
How long can my family run?
We pay him a visit,
we eliminate the threat.
We go straight at him, there is
a chance we don't come back.
You're leaving.
She walked in that door,
I knew right away you'd be leaving.
You have nothing to worry about.
It's not me that
I'm worried about.
Our children need a father.
Whatever you're going to do,
it can't be more important than that.
Do you trust her?
I have to.
If she's a threat to this
family's safety,
if she's a threat to you...
you kill her.
You understand?
Get in!
Hurry!
Stop the car.
Jake, this car will not fit
through that barricade.
Stop the car now!
Thanks. I, uh,
I don't know how this would have
turned out if it weren't for you guys.
- Well, you'll make it up to us someday.
- However we can help.
Those windmills you're looking
to build... I was thinking.
Guys down at the
old brake assembly,
maybe they can convert
part of their plant,
help build what you need.
I know the town could use
a good source of salt.
Looks like we're going
to be seeing a lot of each other.
- Thanks again, guys. Take care.
- Thank you so much.
What?
Jake, I saw the governor.
I saw how it's put together.
I was talking to Ted,
and I think between the two of us,
we can help to make more of them,
but I have to go with him.
- Go with them? Wait a minute.
- No, think about it.
We don't have the resources
to do this the right way.
They've got the machines
and the guys who
know how to use them.
With a dozen full-sized windmills,
you could power the whole town,
run the med center,
forget about gas.
You're just going to leave?
Right now?
It won't be for very long.
Just a few days.
But I know I can help.
I think I need to do this.
You think this is a good idea?
You know why things
didn't work out between us?
I'm not dangerous.
I'm crossword puzzles
and flannel pajamas and
the occasional lite beer.
I was never going to be
hazardous to you.
- That's how you tick.
- No, it isn't.
Of course it is.
But it's okay.
If it wasn't, your dad would
probably be dead right now,
you and I would have
never met on that bus.
So I'm taking a page out of your book.
I'm throwing caution to the wind.
I'm gonna help turn the lights
on for everyone back home.
Just for a few days.
You worried about me?
Come back in one piece.
Dad?
We're out of the good toothpaste.
Oh, well, here's the...
The new stuff that Mr. Daley made.
- This isn't toothpaste.
- Yeah, it is.
Are you playing a joke on me?
Hey, you know, uh,
when you were teething,
you never cried.
See, 'cause most babies,
they cry, but not you.
And your...
mom was worried and the...
doctors were worried,
but not me.
Because I knew you weren't sick,
you weren't hurt,
you were just brave.
'Cause you're
the bravest person I know.
You always have been.
Dad?
What are you talking about?
Sam,
I have to go to work tomorrow.
It's a very important meeting,
but it's quite far away,
so I might not be back
for a day or two,
and I just wanted you to know that.
Are you mad at me?
What?
You're leaving.
You listen to me.
There is nothing that
you, your sister or your mother
could ever do that would
make me want to leave you.
I, uh...
I, I love you.
You understand that, right?
Hey, welcome home.
Success?
- You get the part?
- We had it...
and we lost it.
Uh, where's Heather?
Getting the lights back on.
You do realize that
what happened today
was unnecessary?
And stupid?
You got a lot
of responsibility now.
You're going to have to learn
how to be smart.
I understand.
And you,
you knew that this car
was not going to fit
through that gate?
I know.
I heard you talking to me,
and I knew you were right.
Why didn't you stop the car?
I don't know.
What'd you get?
Look at all this stuff.
Oh, you did great.
This is nothing.
Skylar, how much of the salt mine
does your family own?
I don't know. Why?
'Cause I think we may be rich.
You okay?
Look, uh...
I am glad you made it.
We leave first thing
in the morning.

<i>Previously on Jericho.</i>
So I hear you and I
are going to be partners now.
Where'd you get that?
You're running the store,
you're going to need protection.
Don't make the same mistake
that Gracie made.
Or those people out there
are going to be putting
flowers and candles
on the sidewalk for you.
Who the hell is that?
Remember,
the gas tank on this thing
is on the left-hand side,
so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you,
make sure it's not on that side.
Okay. Anything else?
So, are we going to see you
for Thanksgiving?
Well, I think Mary and I
are going to spend it together.
Well, you're always welcome.
Thanks, but I don't want to put
you guys in an awkward position.
You could have thought of that before
you moved in with your mistress
and left your wife with us.
Some of them were on planes
that landed in the middle of nowhere.
They've been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
Oh, my God.
Is it really you?
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while
until I can sort something out.
Are we in danger, Robert?
You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.
You need to keep them
clean and warm.
Do you have a place to stay?
Do you know anyone in Jericho?
Actually,
I do.
It's freezing in here, too.
Mr. Bintner?
Mr. Bintner?
Joe?
The temperature dropped so fast.
It's going to be a long winter.
All right, everyone!
Everyone, please!
Please!
Right now,
we're using the generator
to power the town hall
for three hours a day,
and the Med Center for six.
And this is how much fuel we have,
and this is how much we need
to get us through the winter.
At current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel
in two weeks.
I wonder when the dancing girls show up.
Stop.
There's a way of doing this without
scaring the crap out of everybody.
He was elected.
Guess he's going to do it his way.
I'm going to need a hobby.
So here's what we're working on.
All right, we got
organized firewood crews...
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Yeah.
There's a woman
in that group of refugees
that Bill is processing,
I think you should talk to her.
Why?
She said she used to be
a cop in Saint Louis.
Especially with 53
new people among us,
we have got to start rethinking things,
fast,
or the people we lost last night
won't be the only casualties
of this coming winter.
What about the windmills?
She's right.
Wind power.
We should be building windmills.
Harry?
I think you all know Harry Carmichael,
our chief engineer
down at the mine.
We've been looking into wind turbines
for weeks now with Mayor Green.
But in order to build anything
that can be connected to the grid,
it's going to take time.
Time I'm not sure we can afford.
- She's in here.
- Thanks, Jimmy.
Hello, Rob.
Any parts we don't have...
we simply don't have
the maching capabilities.
What kind of parts?
Mechanical governors to regulate output.
With the EMP damage, we're figuring
out a lot of this from scratch.
- It's still a long way off.
- Black Jack Fairgrounds.
We walked through it
on our way back here.
It's become a trading post.
People from all over
the region are trading...
food, information,
machine parts.
They may have what we need.
That's got to be a 200-mile drive.
That's a lot of gas for a "maybe."
If we can get one windmill working,
we'd save that much gas in a month.
If we get enough of them,
we could be off gas for good.
It might not be a bad idea
to put a small party together
and go check it out.
Is anyone interested
in volunteering?
Season 1 - Episode 13
" Black Jack "
Transcript: swsub.com
Synchro: Loky
[ www. seriessub.com ]
I know it was you.
- What?
- Those men that grabbed me.
They said that someone
on my team sold us all out.
They said it was you.
And you believe them?
Tell me why I shouldn't.
Come on!
You're smart enough to know
that they will say anything
to get you to talk.
Because you know
I owe you my life
as much as you owe me yours
and because you just...
You just punched me in the face,
and I didn't hit you back.
- Who else is here?
- No one.
Victor showed up
just after D-day.
But he only made it
for a couple of hours.
Did you kill him?
It was the radiation...
from Denver.
No one else made it back here
to the rally point?
You going to tell me
how you got out of that room?
Three armed guys, cuffs.
Three guys and cuffs
keep you in that room?
One of them got too close.
Then there was only two.
Two was easy.
From there,
I drove as fast as I could.
Saw the clouds
from D. C. and Baltimore.
Ran out of gas in West Virginia.
Went from refugee camp
to refugee camp
however I could.
I'm glad you made it.
You left me.
I know.
So what now?
We caught wind of some raiding parties
at interchanges here and here.
But if you're careful,
you should be safe
the rest of the way.
Once you're at Black Jack,
watch your back.
Thieves?
It's not the thieves you got
to worry about, it's the guards.
They've got a reputation
of being really ruthless.
Without the cops
or the National Guard,
it's the only way they
guaranteed it's safe enough
to keep commerce going there.
You'd better take two or three
of the border patrol guys with you.
Just in case you run
into any surprises.
I'm coming, too.
Not a chance in hell.
Would you know
a working mechanical governor
for a wind turbine
if you saw one?
I'm not taking
passengers out there.
Jake, Mr. Carmichael has a family.
I can help.
You need me.
Mrs. Green?
What?
Eric told me that
April's pregnant.
I just...
- If there's anything that I can do...
- Mary...
I think you've done quite enough.
Always got to be the first one
to jump in the fire, don't you?
Somebody's got to go.
Yeah, well, just seems
that someone is always you.
Gray's having a few bags of salt
packed up for us to trade.
Smart.
Who else is going?
Apparently Heather.
Gray thinks I should take
a couple of guys from border patrol.
That's it?
I'm not so sure
pulling them off patrol
just to watch my back
is such a good idea.
Besides, only a handful of them
even know what they're doing.
You don't think
I can watch your back?
Why? You want to go?
Look, you've already seen
what it's like out there. I just...
need to see it for myself.
Besides, I'm unemployed.
I'm not obsolete.
Did you ask Mom?
Son, I am 59 years old.
I was mayor of this town
since the Carter administration.
I'm a retired U. S. Army Ranger
and a combat veteran.
Of course I asked your mother.
I could go downstairs and...
warm some water
for a bath for you.
I didn't think I was ever
going to finish this.
Hey, uh...
we have a guest.
This is Sarah.
Hey, Dale?
Hey. What are you
doing back there?
Uh, inventory.
Is it that bad?
Well, Mr. Houghton just showed up
with Mrs. Leigh's cut of the produce.
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, exactly.
Well, did you point out
that it's rotten?
They're all screwing me.
Hardly anyone's honoring their deals.
My dad used to have to deal with stuff
like this all the time
down at the salt mine.
- Well, how did he do it?
- He just...
did whatever it took
to keep things running.
I'm not shutting this place down.
Actually,
I may have
good news about that.
But you might have
to take a little trip.
I need to talk to you.
All right.
I shouldn't have sprung this on you.
This is too weird...
What? What's weird?
I kissed you.
A month ago.
And we haven't spoken since.
Generally, people speak
after something like that.
I'm just going to...
You know...
I know, I'm, uh...
- I'm sorry, really...
- You don't have to apologize.
I'm not upset.
I understand
why it happened.
Look, I want to go
because I think I can help get
this place back up on its feet.
That's it.
It's not a date.
Mr. Mayor?
I'm not the mayor anymore, Dale.
What is it?
I need to come with you.
I want to take it all.
Trade it for something
I can actually use
to build this store up again.
Whatever I don't use,
I'll put towards
supplies the town needs.
You're just going to give it
away to the town for nothing?
It's the right thing to do, isn't it?
I just want to help.
Well,
this is one hell of a crew
we're putting together here.
All right.
Yeah, we'll leave
first thing in the morning.
You just happen to know
someone who just...
happened to wander into town?
Look at me.
I'm not going to lie to you.
But I can't...
I can't tell you any more
than I already have.
So she's a friend, okay?
The last time you let someone
from that part of your life
- into our home, it was 4 years ago.
- This is different.
Well, you couldn't tell me
who he was.
But you told me not to worry.
Two weeks later, you left.
I didn't see you again
until two months ago.
This is different.
Sam cried for weeks.
I mean, he was four-years-old.
He didn't understand why
you'd want to leave him.
I just...
I don't know if I can watch him
go through that again.
What is going on here?
Come here.
What is this?
So I'm being watched.
By who?
My guess...
The Old Man.
Why...?
You still have the package, don't you?
He's been coordinating
this thing from the beginning,
feeding us information.
Why would he turn on us now?
I don't know.
You still have
a way to reach him?
And have you...
told him that you
made contact with me yet?
- Not yet.
- Then do it.
You do it...
and you see what he says.
"Thieves will be strung up."
We need your guns.
Pick them up on the way out.
Go ahead.
They're kidding about
the "strung up" thing, right?
They don't mean that literally.
Looks like everyone
checks in here at the main tent.
They try and match
buyers and sellers.
They gave me three
possibilities of sellers
that might have the part
for the windmill.
It's like eBay.
Not like eBay.
All right, look, um...
see if you can find the governor,
I'm going to stick with Dale.
See what he can trade for.
Let's do this thing quick
then we're out of here.
Morning.
Good morning.
Last night,
you fell asleep mid-sentence.
- I did?
- Yes, you did.
Standing up right there
at the sink, shaving.
You were going to tell me
what you've seen out there and...
Roger, I...
I don't want to push.
I can't even imagine how awful
it was for you out there. I just...
A lot of it was.
Listen.
If I tell you something,
will you promise not to think...
I've lost it?
Of course.
Out there...
I saw... something.
I haven't told
anybody about it. I...
can't explain it.
The thing is...
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
From there I ended up
in a tent city outside of Lexington.
So, what are they like?
The camps?
Each is, uh... different.
Some are overcrowded, dangerous.
Some are better run.
Did you see people
with radiation poisoning?
Some, yes.
What do they look like?
Lots of burns,
tissue loss, some vomiting.
Allie, Sam.
Upstairs.
How do you know my dad?
We worked together.
Do you know how
to play football?
Of course, I do.
Doesn't everybody?
Not everybody.
Hey, Samuel, now.
Come on.
You know, these kids
have been through enough.
I... I'm sorry.
Look, I don't know you.
I really don't want to.
I know the kind of people
my husband works with.
No matter how close
the two of you are,
I don't need my kids
exposed to that world.
I've been married to
this man a long time.
I got pretty good at reading
between the lines.
Thanks, Mary.
Why don't you and I sit down
together and have a drink?
Hey, how much?
- Beg pardon?
- How much?
How much for what?
I don't know.
An hour?
An hour of what?
Wait, what?! No!
- How about a half hour?
- Is everything all right?
- I'm not a hooker, pal!
- Then what are you doing here?
All right, that's enough.
That's enough, man.
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey, no. No.
No problem. Everything's fine.
No kidding, buddy.
You don't want to mess with
the guards here, it gets ugly, fast.
Thanks for the help.
Heather.
Oh, my God, Ted.
I can't believe you're here.
Jake, this is Ted Lewis.
We grew up together
over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
I was so worried about you.
We were going to send a party
to make contact with you guys,
but the roads were
just so dangerous.
What are you guys doing here?
We're looking for parts
for a windmill generator.
Unsuccessfully.
Hey, there's a guy
we deal with here...
who doesn't always
report to the main tent,
but sometimes he's got
those specialty items
nobody else has.
You want to see him?
- Yeah, let's check it out.
- All right.
Get this stuff out of here
before somebody sees it.
Why, what's wrong with it?
Nickel...
the silver stuff
is all alloyed with it.
So?
So nickel absorbs radioactivity.
Stuff that's been looted
from hot zones
is making a lot of people sick.
No one wants it.
This stuff was nowhere
near the fallout.
Look, kid,
if I can't sell it, I can't sell it.
What do you want me to tell you?
What else do you got?
So what does have value here?
Not much of what you got.
Check the board over there.
Why salt?
It's a preservative.
An antibiotic.
You need 1,500 milligrams
of it a day to survive.
The Romans actually
used it as currency.
Whole African empires
were based on the control
and supply of it.
Wars have been fought over salt.
Food, medical supplies,
a generator, all air-dropped,
all from China.
What?
Yeah, we got an airdrop, too.
The thing is...
it was from Germany.
It's aid. It must be coming
from all over the world.
Well, if aid's coming
from all over the world then...
who did this to us?
A group of thugs a few weeks back,
guys claiming to be
government contractors.
So the mayor thought
we should make security a priority.
He resigned his office and...
appointed Sheriff Constantino
acting city manager.
The contractors,
who were they?
A security detail from a...
company called Ravenwood.
They came in looking for supplies.
A few of the shop owners resisted
and they got violent.
They killed three,
they injured eight.
They drove off with
a truckload of our diesel.
But since then,
the sheriff's managed to
keep control of things.
Crime really isn't a
problem for us anymore.
How'd he manage that?
- What is this?
- The news.
Where does all this come from?
People pass through here
from all over.
Everyone brings
a little piece of the puzzle.
Do you have
something to write on?
You guys don't
get out much, do you?
It gets better.
What are the stars for?
Capitals.
Of what?
The federal government.
Federal government? But...
There are six stars up there.
Where's the president?
Which one?
Six presidents, I...
I don't understand.
Who's in charge of the military?
You're assuming
there's only one of those, too.
All right, come on, let's go.
Isn't there a line of succession,
so there's only one successor?
The word is HHS.
Secretary Charles is supposed
to be next in line,
but there are five other guys
who seem to think
the attacks changed the rules.
Senator Morrisette in Oregon,
Senator Tomarchio in Wyoming...
They're all staking a claim,
gathering support.
Then what happens?
How do they figure out who's in charge?
Either they start making deals,
- compromise...
- Or?
Or they fight.
Six bags of soybean seed,
and still it's...
It's not enough.
Maybe this whole thing
was a bad idea.
It's a start.
Dale, wait up.
It'd be a lot easier for you
to close the store, wouldn't it?
But instead, you're out here
trying to keep it going.
I think Gracie
would be proud of you.
I think your mom would
be proud of you, too.
When my mom died,
there was nothing I could do about it.
But then after Mrs. Leigh...
Mitchell Cafferty
is going to get his due
whether Gray finds him or not.
Sooner or later, he's going
to cross the wrong person.
One of these days,
it's going to catch up with him.
I don't like to drink
while I'm working.
To be honest, I have
difficulty understanding
how many ways I dislike you.
You made a list?
Mrs. Green, I don't think I...
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there
and listen to what
I have to say.
What you and Eric
did to April was awful.
But she's going
to get through this
because she is
one strong woman.
But there's a baby on the way,
and it happens
to be my grandchild.
And I intend to do
everything I can
to protect it from this world.
But what you've done,
I can't protect it from.
You've divided the family.
And as hard as that child's
life was going to be,
you have made it
so much more difficult.
I don't think that's something
I'll ever be able to forgive.
When I was a kid,
my mom split on my dad and I.
She left with the guy
she met in Denver...
This isn't about you.
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there
and listen to what I have to say.
I lay awake at night
terrified that I have
put April in the same
position my dad was in...
Terrified that I have put this child
in the same position that I was in.
My mistake was falling
in love with your son,
I never should have let
it happen, but I did.
I know the cost.
I know how wrong it is.
But the problem is,
he loves me, too.
And I don't know
how you undo that.
So if you want
to go on hating me,
if you never accept me...
I can't say as I blame you.
So I went to find help.
I was more messed up
than I thought.
I wandered for days.
Eventually...
passed out in this... field.
So there I was,
the middle of Nebraska
feeling like that was the place
I was going to die.
And then,
the strangest thing happened.
There was a...
light in the sky.
A bright light with a...
ring around it.
I...
went... towards it.
Two miles later...
I stumbled into
the refugee camp.
That light...
saved my life.
Been looking all over for you.
Did you find the part?
I think so.
Did you see the news?
You looking to trade
for a mechanical governor?
Okay, let's talk trade.
Eight bags of salt
at 35 pound per.
Russell, what did they think?
That they're the first ones
to think of this?
These parts are in high demand.
I'm not giving it away.
- What more is it going to take?
- What more?
I turned away a guy
just this morning,
and he offered 80 gallons
of diesel for the thing.
Listen...
We have more salt
than you can imagine.
We have the largest
salt mine for 400 miles
and we've got men to mine it.
But if you ever want
to see any of it,
we need to make
this deal right now, today.
You understand?
Okay, listen,
I'll vouch for him.
All right?
All right.
We got a deal.
Wait here. I'll go get it.
These things aren't
easy to make, you know.
Not the good ones anyway.
Dad, this is Russell.
Hi. Good to meet you.
Mr. Mayor?
No kidding, Dale,
I am not the mayor anymore.
There's blood on them.
- You need some help there?
- What the hell is this?
Are you conducting an inspection
or are we doing a deal?
No, we're not supporting that.
We'll find another solution.
Well, then we're all done here,
aren't we?
Why don't you get out?
Get out of here.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
You, too!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Guys, I'm so sorry.
We had no idea.
We need that part.
- And we're going to have to figure out
a way... - Where's Dale?
Dale, where'd you get off to?
Don't just wander off like that.
Did you steal that?
He's a bad guy.
He can't get away with that.
We got to get that back before
they realize it's missing.
It's okay I went out
the back. No one saw me.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hand him over.
He made a mistake, all right?
He'll give back what he took.
It's no harm done, all right?
Excuse me. You know,
he really is sorry and
the property is back
where it belongs.
He can explain it to management.
I'm just asking you,
use a little discretion,
that's all, please.
Excuse me, but could I talk
to whoever's in charge here?
Look, old man, I told you...
That's enough!
How long have you been
with the FBI?
14 years.
Started right out of college.
It's dangerous out there, isn't it?
I don't think your mom wants me
talking to you about that.
I'm not a kid.
It's pretty bad.
My dad's been teaching me
how to shoot.
I wonder if that's why.
He's been teaching you
how to shoot?
A little.
I'm not sure if I like it.
It's a weird feeling, but...
it's the first time I can remember
the two of us actually doing
something together.
Where's your father?
It's the old man.
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.
He knows where you are.
We need to go.
We need to move now.
No, I don't know.
You don't know?
This country is going
to be what we make of it.
There are only a
handful of other people
that know what we know.
We have to keep fighting.
We have to stay alive.
We go see him, and if,
if he is behind this,
we take him out.
Take him out?
Yeah, I mean,
how long can we run?
How long can my family run?
We pay him a visit,
we eliminate the threat.
We go straight at him, there is
a chance we don't come back.
You're leaving.
She walked in that door,
I knew right away you'd be leaving.
You have nothing to worry about.
It's not me that
I'm worried about.
Our children need a father.
Whatever you're going to do,
it can't be more important than that.
Do you trust her?
I have to.
If she's a threat to this
family's safety,
if she's a threat to you...
you kill her.
You understand?
Get in!
Hurry!
Stop the car.
Jake, this car will not fit
through that barricade.
Stop the car now!
Thanks. I, uh,
I don't know how this would have
turned out if it weren't for you guys.
- Well, you'll make it up to us someday.
- However we can help.
Those windmills you're looking
to build... I was thinking.
Guys down at the
old brake assembly,
maybe they can convert
part of their plant,
help build what you need.
I know the town could use
a good source of salt.
Looks like we're going
to be seeing a lot of each other.
- Thanks again, guys. Take care.
- Thank you so much.
What?
Jake, I saw the governor.
I saw how it's put together.
I was talking to Ted,
and I think between the two of us,
we can help to make more of them,
but I have to go with him.
- Go with them? Wait a minute.
- No, think about it.
We don't have the resources
to do this the right way.
They've got the machines
and the guys who
know how to use them.
With a dozen full-sized windmills,
you could power the whole town,
run the med center,
forget about gas.
You're just going to leave?
Right now?
It won't be for very long.
Just a few days.
But I know I can help.
I think I need to do this.
You think this is a good idea?
You know why things
didn't work out between us?
I'm not dangerous.
I'm crossword puzzles
and flannel pajamas and
the occasional lite beer.
I was never going to be
hazardous to you.
- That's how you tick.
- No, it isn't.
Of course it is.
But it's okay.
If it wasn't, your dad would
probably be dead right now,
you and I would have
never met on that bus.
So I'm taking a page out of your book.
I'm throwing caution to the wind.
I'm gonna help turn the lights
on for everyone back home.
Just for a few days.
You worried about me?
Come back in one piece.
Dad?
We're out of the good toothpaste.
Oh, well, here's the...
The new stuff that Mr. Daley made.
- This isn't toothpaste.
- Yeah, it is.
Are you playing a joke on me?
Hey, you know, uh,
when you were teething,
you never cried.
See, 'cause most babies,
they cry, but not you.
And your...
mom was worried and the...
doctors were worried,
but not me.
Because I knew you weren't sick,
you weren't hurt,
you were just brave.
'Cause you're
the bravest person I know.
You always have been.
Dad?
What are you talking about?
Sam,
I have to go to work tomorrow.
It's a very important meeting,
but it's quite far away,
so I might not be back
for a day or two,
and I just wanted you to know that.
Are you mad at me?
What?
You're leaving.
You listen to me.
There is nothing that
you, your sister or your mother
could ever do that would
make me want to leave you.
I, uh...
I, I love you.
You understand that, right?
Hey, welcome home.
Success?
- You get the part?
- We had it...
and we lost it.
Uh, where's Heather?
Getting the lights back on.
You do realize that
what happened today
was unnecessary?
And stupid?
You got a lot
of responsibility now.
You're going to have to learn
how to be smart.
I understand.
And you,
you knew that this car
was not going to fit
through that gate?
I know.
I heard you talking to me,
and I knew you were right.
Why didn't you stop the car?
I don't know.
What'd you get?
Look at all this stuff.
Oh, you did great.
This is nothing.
Skylar, how much of the salt mine
does your family own?
I don't know. Why?
'Cause I think we may be rich.
You okay?
Look, uh...
I am glad you made it.
We leave first thing
in the morning.

<i>Previously on </i>Jericho
When were you planning
on telling me about the baby?
A bad marriage doesn't get better
because you add a kid.
I didn't want you to stay with me
because of the baby, Eric.
Heather!
My God.
Uh... Jake, this is Ted Lewis.
We grew up together
over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.
I'm going to help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.
- Just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.
I have something
in my possession
and it puts you, me and the kids
in danger here.
Sarah is not on our side.
She's not here to help us.
Hawkins is starting
to put the pieces together.
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
Why are you stalling on this one?
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?
I won't follow you.
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.
Honey, you look tired.
You getting enough sleep?
Almost seven hours.
- Where?
- In my office.
Sleeping in your office
doesn't count.
You're going to give
the baby a crick in its neck.
You're going to make
a terrific grandmother.
- I know.
- You're Dr. Green? - Yes.
Jessica Williams.
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Ostrowski says
he's having chest pains.
He doesn't want anybody
to look at him but you.
Are you the doctor
who came in with the refugees?
Close. Third-year med student,
University of Chicago.
And I prefer
"visitor" to "refugee."
I'm sorry.
Thanks for the help.
Don't thank me.
I'm just working here
'cause I get to sleep in a bed
instead of the church basement.
Where do I start?
Pneumonia,
malnutrition, hypothermia.
Just grab a chart
and pick a patient.
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Hey, Jim.
Hope I didn't wake the kids.
No, you're okay.
Mine are the same way.
Up at all hours.
Worse when we had TV.
Is there something
I can do for you, Jim?
Sorry. Um...
Mayor Anderson wants me
to keep track of the refugees.
You know,
find out where they end up.
See what kind of work
they're doing to help the town.
Sarah Mason.
She's been...
staying with you, right?
Mr. Hawkins...
It's freezing out here. Uh...
Is she around?
- Oh, the generator's back on.
- Thank God.
Well, that's it.
We're on our last tank of diesel.
Power's out to everything
but the medical center.
Our last tank?
How long will we have power?
Ten, maybe 12 hours,
so turn off anything
you're not using.
What about the biodiesel?
We burned through it.
We're not going
to have any more for days.
We need to come up
with another plan.
We're getting more and
more people in here every...
Oh, God!
April, can you hear me?
Is she breathing?
April, wake up!
Get over here!

It's colder than a witch's patootie.
Using candles.
I saw you had some electric lights on
when I was walking up.
I got a geni
in the basement, but, uh...
I just used the last of my gas.
What were you doing?
I'm putting some stuff
in storage, but, uh...
I was just cleaning up.
Using the last of your fuel
on housework, huh?
Darcy's trained you well.
Listen, Jimmy, um...
I was just about to turn in, so...
Right. Sorry.
Uh, well, like I said,
Mayor Anderson's got me keeping
tabs on the refugees, you know.
Crime's up.
So, Sarah Mason.
Is she here?
Can I ask her some questions?
You know, um...
Sarah left yesterday.
Something about, uh...
family in New Orleans.
Wow. In this weather?
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.
Hey, don't worry about it.
You know, that's a...
nasty- looking cut
you got there.
Uh, yeah, it was, uh...
tree branch when
I was cutting wood.
- Must have been a real bleeder.
- Hey, it's not too deep.
Well, you be careful.
It's dangerous out there.
Again, sorry to bother you.
Yes.
I don't feel good.
I'm so tired all of a sudden.
I know.
I told you you need
to get some rest.
Here's your big chance.
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you, honey.
I'm trying to keep her calm,
but my gut tells me
the baby's having a problem,
and if I know it, she knows it.
- What are we going to do?
- Get Kenchy?
There's another doctor in town?
The man can barely
sit up on his bar stool.
Look, what I really need is
an ultrasound machine.
Without it, there's no real way
to know what's going on.
Well, maybe we have one that
survived the EMP in the basement.
- I'll go look.
- Good.
You go get your father
and tell him to find Eric.
He's the one who should be here.
It's the guys from New Bern.
They actually built the thing.
I can't believe it.
Hey, Russell.
- Hey. Sheriff, good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Johnston, you SOB.
- How the hell did you lose an election?
- No, the question is,
how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Well, this is our new mayor.
This is Gray Anderson.
- Mayor Anderson.
- Nice to meet you.
Congratulations.
Thank you. Thank you.
So, this is the windmill, huh?
It's a power-generating wind turbine.
We get about 1,500 watts an hour
out of one of these.
- Have you seen Eric?
- No, did you try Mary's?
Yeah. I tried there.
I tried at Bailey's.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably some time tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
I think we're going to need it
at the medical center.
- You got it.
- There's something wrong with April.
What? What is it?
She passed out. They think
there's a problem with the baby.
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
I'll walk.
Stanley thinks that you're using
this whole volunteering thing
as an excuse
to see Sean Henthorn.
I'm just following orders
to keep an eye on you.
Personally, I don't give
a damn who you date.
I've been volunteering here
since I was 16.
It's not about Sean.
You volunteer for anything? Ever?
Mr. Fredrickson.
Come on, stop.
Gracie gave you beet seed
in exchange for 3% of your farm crop.
That 3% is mine now.
The store was left to me.
I can't do that, Dale.
Things have gotten worse now.
I need it for my family,
to feed the last of my livestock.
I'm sorry.
It's the law, Mr. Fredrickson.
It's rightfully mine.
There are no more laws, son.
No.
I volunteered.
So. What do I do?
Empty. Clean. Repeat.
Where the hell is Eric?
Nobody knows.
Dad's getting Bill on it.
Her blood pressure's dropping.
- I'm feeling contractions.
- I think she's going into labor.
No, no, I can't.
The baby's only 16 weeks.
I need, I need ritodrine
to stop the labor.
I already checked.
We don't have any more.
I'll try to find some nifedipine.
All right, now what are you feeling?
If I lose consciousness,
and you can't find any medicine,
use alcohol.
What do you mean?
What kind of alcohol?
Anything coming out of the still.
Give me a 10% drip.
It'll stop the contractions.
Oh, God, she's bleeding.
Get Kenchy. Now!
I'm so cold my mouth is numb.
We need the logs or we're
going to freeze to death.
Isn't that what we're doing now?
All right. Let's get in the car.
Blanket.
Let's turn on the heat.
We can't. I'm sorry.
We won't have enough gas to get home.
You know, we could make our own heat.
Don't get any ideas...
I'm not taking my clothes off.
You know how happy you make me.
I'm still not taking my clothes off.
Come on!
What's her pressure?
- You smell like a wino.
- Nice to meet you too.
- What's her pressure, please ?
- 80/44 and dropping.
- Is she dilated?
- Two centimeters.
Her contractions are six minutes apart.
I need an ultrasound.
I brought some old ones
up from the basement.
I'll go check on them now.
- Do we have fresh plasma?
- No.
I need you to find somebody...
- With O-negative blood.
- Yes.
And we need
a fetal heart monitor.
Do we have that?
No?
I need you to put these on
and monitor the baby's heart rate.
Here, put these in your ear.
I'll show you how to listen.
I'm deaf.
Madam?
I need you to put these in ears.
I need you to monitor
the baby's heart rate.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I will show you how.
Come on, let's go! Please!
Here we go. Put these on.
Listen right here.
Now, the higher one,
the fast one.
You hear that?
That's the baby's heart rate.
You count 15 seconds,
and then you multiply
that by four.
- To get the beats per minute.
- Perfect
now I will show you
how to take blood pressure
and pulse rate.
All right, let's get ready to lift it.
You want me to settle
a contract dispute?!
Mr. Fredrickson isn't giving
Dale his share.
You're kidding me, right?
I'm trying to get power restored.
I got home robberies all over town.
The refugees are threatening
to break into the food lockup.
Okay, we're going to go on three.
One...
two...
three.
There we go.
A little higher, a little higher.
Okay, easy
Got it.
Watch the rope.
There you go.
Keep it going.
Almost there.
You got enough on your side?
Keep it taut.
Good job, fellas.
How's the baby?
I don't know.
How close is this?
I don't know, hours, at least.
Did you find Eric?
No. Bill and the rangers
are out looking for him.
Can we buy some more of these things?
Yeah. Let's talk about it.
<i>Mr. Hawkins!</i>
<i>I'm back!</i>
<i>Mr. Hawkins, you around?</i>
Just a second!
You weren't answering
your front door, so I just...
You doing some yard work?
You need a hand?
No. No, thank you.
I was going to turn some compost.
Getting ready to plant
food for the spring.
That's a good idea.
Margaret's planting carrots inside.
They're a super-food,
you know...
like broccoli.
You need something, Jimmy?
Gray wants me to find out
what kind of resources
Sarah might've taken with her, you know?
Fuel, food. Did she...
drive out of town?
- She didn't drive.
Took a backpack.
Some food...
a tent.
Then just walked out into the cold, huh?
That's crazy.
Maybe Darcy knows something more.
No, I don't think so.
I just figured,
you know, women talk, and who knows
what the hell they say, right?
Is Darcy around?
Can I...
can I speak with her?
Darcy and I are having problems.
She's moved out.
Boy, that's tough.
A lot of people leaving you lately, huh?
I'm-I'm sorry.
That's insensitive. I...
I will get my coat.
I'll take you to her, Jimmy.
Really?
<i>Hey, how are your, uh,
communication skills?</i>
You know, 'cause that's really
what marriage is all about.
<i>Honesty, love.</i>
<i>I'd say it's 50-50.</i>
<i>Sort of like half and half, you know?</i>
Well, actually, more like thirds,
if you throw respect in there.
<i>But not equal thirds, 'cause honesty...</i>
<i>is more important than
the love and the respect.</i>
<i>I think.</i>
You got one of the only
salt mines around for 400 miles.
A year without salt, and New Bern
will be a ghost town.
What are we talking about,
a couple hundred pounds?
No, we need a lot more than that.
- We're going to need food.
- No food to spare.
Won't see another crop till spring.
Spring crop's what I'm talking about.
Ten wind turbines for,
let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.
Spring crop might not even
get us to next year.
If we lose ten percent, we'll just be
in the same position we are now.
Worse.
Look, all we're asking you
to do is be reasonable.
Well, we're just trying to survive.
Starve next fall or freeze
this winter...
take your pick.
Vancomycin... good.
Start a drip: 250 milligrams IV.
I'll do it.
We found four people who are O-negative.
- Fetal heart rate is 169.
- I'll get it off the ultrasound.
Her blood pressure is 130/70.
Her respiratory rate is 18,
and her pulse is 88, it's going up.
She's losing blood.
Her heart's compensating
by pumping harder.
Start an IV for the blood.
What do you see?
- Placenta previa.
- What's that?
The placenta is covering
the entire cervix.
There's no way for me to find out
where the bleed is coming from
unless we operate.
Well, what are we going to do?
Under the best of circumstances,
this is not an operating facility.
- Then we don't have a choice.
- Cannot operate here.
Why?
I have been through this more times
than you could possibly imagine.
We've all been through a lot, all right?
Just tell us...
I have seen
hundreds of people die
because of dirty facilities
and infection
and because I didn't have
the proper medicine
or the equipment
that I needed.
I am not doing it again.
We are not losing this baby.
You can find yourself another butcher.
There's got to be a way.
Kenchy. Listen,
we need a sterile operating room,
sterile instruments,
anesthesia, spinal block tray,
caesarian tray.
Have you ever even seen a surgery
performed without
an electrocautery machine?
No, you haven't. Because
this doesn't even taught anymore.
Can't we just use laparotomy
sponges to stop the bleeding?
God, my head is killing me.
We've got several spinal block trays,
and we've got anesthesia.
And we can boil
the sheets and the tools.
Is it possible?
- Remotely.
- Then start.
- We need bleach.
- What?
Bleach.
You know? Bleach.
Bonnie, look at my lips.
Bleach !
Learn.
- Is that the word for "bleach"?
- No.
"Bitch."
And... "please."
And "sorry."
I'm heading out.
If I'm not back, lock up at dark
and don't let anyone in.
Also, if I'm not around ever
and you need anything,
just talk to Gail Green or Johnston.
You can trust them.
I'm going to come with you.
Why?
Two against one.
Hey, Bill.
What's wrong?
I just jumped in.
It was...
It was just in the moment.
You volunteered at the medical center
long before I ever get here.
It's fine.
Kenchy just doesn't know you.
Everybody else respects you.
They speak your language.
- Hey, we got a problem.
- What's that?
Eddie and Frank are asking
how come you're not making the deal.
Words are gonna start to spread.
As far as they know,
the marines said that
the army corp of engineers would
be here within the month.
What difference does it make if we give
New Bern a part of next year's profit?
They think there's going
to be food by then.
You didn't want to tell them it was
a bunch of crap, so now what do we do?
All right,
maybe we should tell the town
that help's not coming.
We just told them that to give 'em
something to get through winter.
Town's already on the edge,
you'll have anarchy.
And I'm not leverage
next winter's food,
that'd be suicide.
What if we tell New Bern that
we'll give them
10% of next year's crop.
We get power now.
If next year we don't have
the food to give, we don't give it up.
That's how wars get started.
I can't believe Darcy is staying
at the refugee shelter.
Hey, Jim,
let me talk to her a second.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I asked you to stay away.
Jimmy wanted to ask you
some questions...
about Sarah.
Where are the kids?
They're in the gym, playing.
We need a consistent cover story.
What'd you do with her body?
I buried her.
So I can tell them that right now,
and never see you again.
I could tell him about...
- What did you call it... "the package"?
- Stop it!
You understand the story?
Family? New Orleans?
And you don't know
anything else about her.
This'll just take a sec.
Yeah, well, I don't want
to talk to you in front of him.
Why don't you give us
a minute, Mr. Hawkins?
I'll be out front...
let you two talk.
You're going to be okay, angel.
Did you ever do
a surgical rotation?
Only in school.
Most of my career was in post-op.
I feel obligated to ask you
if you're sober enough to do this.
You can talk me through it.
You will refer to me
as Dr. Dhuwalia, Nurse.
And my sobriety is not the issue.
The people I call "doctor"
don't smell like a brewery.
Respirations are 16.
Pulse rate is 82.
Her blood pressure's down to 100/62.
God help us.
- Is the baby okay?
- I don't know.
Mom said there's a problem.
We were just
collecting firewood.
You don't have
to explain it to me.
What about Mom?
Don't worry about that.
Shut the door.
We're losing too much blood.
Clamp it off.
Get away from the incision!
I need to hear
if the baby's in distress.
Get away from the incision.
You haven't let me get
a pulse from this baby in an hour.
Respirations are 16, pulse is 84.
Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.
You're not close enough to the fetus.
It's not an accurate measurement.
The placenta's grown into
the uterus wall. It's ripping away.
- That's what's causing the bleeding.
- Now I've lost it.
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?
The baby's heart beat has stopped.
- What do you mean, it's stopped?
- Do something.
That must be
the last of the diesel.
Open the door.
Open the blinds.
I need light.
Why aren't you doing
something about the baby?
This hasn't been about
the baby for several hours.
The baby never really had a chance.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you saying?
I am trying to save April.
- What do you want?
- Same thing as before.
- My share of the crop.
- I told you I can't do that. Go home.
I'm only asking for what's mine.
You said there's no law, right?
I'm not trying to cheat anybody.
I don't have that much left.
Then give my share
of whatever you got.
Right now.
- What's going on?
- I... I just...
need some space right now.
We lost the baby.
Oh, sweetie...
I need to be
with April right now.
What took you so long?
Well after...
talking with Darcy, uh...
a lot of things are starting
to make sense now.
You all right, Mr. Hawkins?
I'm fine.
Well, Darcy said...
that Sarah left for New Orleans,
just like you told me.
What? You think I was lying?
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.
She doesn't need
to be staying in the shelter.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
We found a body, Robert.
Out in the woods.
Near Mill Creek.
Broken neck.
Animals got to it.
Michael Connor was on patrol,
said he saw
an African-American woman
driving out that way
a couple nights ago.
Perfect description of Sarah Mason.
Really?
Think she could do
something like that?
I don't know.
You know,
I'm learning that, uh...
it's hard to figure what
people are capable of, Jimmy.
Well, our John Doe was bald.
Know anyone looks like that?
If Sarah comes back...
we'd really, really
like to talk to her.
My guess is...
she's not coming back.
That'd be my guess, too.
New Bern's all made of clay,
can't grow nothing.
We need 10% of your spring crop,
and 700 pounds refined salt.
Well, y-you said 500 earlier.
- Price went up.
- Why?
Because that's what
power costs in this world.
Oh, now, come on...
We got people freezing
to death in their homes.
Give us a break.
You were at my son's wedding.
I'm sorry for your troubles.
But we got our own.
We'll give you the food.
We'll give you the salt.
Everything.
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.
What guarantee do we have
you'll give us our share of the crop?
You have our word.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
We can take them
back with us now.
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?
Human beings as collateral?
I would never do that.
But I am not going
to build these things on credit.
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.
Just hold the pressure.
Put pressure right there.
Right there.
Press, harder!
Damn it! I can't see!
I- I'll get another lantern.
You can bring ten lanterns.
Doesn't make any difference.
It's not going to be enough.
I need real light!
Blood pressure is down to 66/30.
This is crazy.
This is crazy. Close her up.
But we haven't stopped
the bleeding.
- What are you doing?
- Give her some peace.
Give her some dignity.
You are not giving up on her.
I'm sorry.
Close this up.
Where do you think you're going?
You get back inside, right now!
- Come on!
- Take it easy.
Take it easy, all right?
Just let me handle this.
Let me handle it.
What are you doing?
You want me to say it
in front of him?
Go back inside, all right?
April needs you.
To go on operating
is cruel and pointless.
Don't even ask me, Jake.
I'm done with this.
I became a plastic surgeon
so I could have the simple, easy life
that other man face.
- Not in this town.
- I don't care.
I'm not going through this anymore.
It is madness.
And everyone here
can just go to hell?
If you stop trying, and I stop,
then they see that.
And this whole thing falls apart.
We're all leaning on each other here,
whether you like it or not.
Promise me
you are not saying
that we're all connected.
This is not some existential,
web-of-life BS.
That is not what I'm hearing,
is it, Jake?
Then tell me
what you want to hear.
'Cause I'll say anything,
if you'll just go back in there
and keep trying.
She's going to die.
I know.
Okay. New gloves.
Let's get this bleeding
stopped, shall we?
- Well, we've got more sponges.
- Excellent!
Pack them in others vascular bleeding.
Just give me time to suture.
He's going to need you.
Now.
Hold my hand.
I'm right here.
I'm right next to you.
I like the name Tracy.
Tracy's a beautiful name.
Thank you for not saying anything.
I didn't do it for you,
I did it for Allison.
I need my family to come home.
I, uh...
I need you.
You know, in the last
three months,
I remembered all the reasons
why I need you in my life.
So have I.
I've also remembered
why it can never work.
I need truth, Robert, and that's
something you've never given me.
- Everything I do, I do for us.
- Listen.
When you hide a part of yourself,
I don't care what the reason is...
it puts something between us.
Please.
My daughter just killed a woman.
I don't have any more trust to give you.
So, I got the kids with
Margaret back at the house.
What can I carry?
This.
Hang in there.
I got faith in you guys.
Sorry?
The wind turbine's working.
Mrs. Hodges, how are you doing?
- Not so hot.
- Let's get you checked out again.
Dr. Dhuwalia.
Mrs. Hodges' cough is worse.
Her temperature is 102.
- Hello, Mrs. Hodges.
- I'm Dr. Dhuwalia.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Why don't you go outside
and get a pan of boiling hot water
build a tent with a sheet. We need to
get this lady breathing some moist air.
Take a deep breath.
There we go.
That was incredible!
Did you see the look on his face?
I know, I thought he
was going to have a heart attack,
and we were going to have
to drive him to the medical center.
I think we're going to be okay.
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to be there...
with you.
<i>You men are the only ones
who really know what's going on here.</i>
When New Bern gets
their share of the spring crop,
you'll be allowed to return.
I know that sounds like a long time,
but what you are about to do
means this town's survival.
Now you've...
I know your families want some time
to say good-bye. So let's get going.
Promise me something...
Promise you won't kill
Mimi while I'm gone.
And you'll give her food.
Why do you have to go?
People are going to die if we
don't get these wind turbines...
You're all have.
I'll be back.
Take care of Bonnie, okay?
Look, I just want to tell you something.
- And don't freak out, okay?
- I won't.
In this...
crazy world we don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow and...
I don't wanna leave
anything unsaid, so...
I'm just going to say it, okay?
So here I go...
I've loved you since the
first day I saw you at Bailey's.
You said it... you said it first.
No one's ever said
it first to me before.
I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow, and...
Plus,
I can hold it over you
for the rest of our lives.
I love you, Stanley Richmond.
But I said it first.
It wasn't your fault, Eric.
You don't have to do this.
I can't be here right now.
I can't.
Take care, son.
Be strong.
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mom.
We'll take care of Mary.
All right, let's move out.
My dad told me what's happening.
First you're helping us, and now this...
What the hell's going on?
They're going to be fine.
I'm going to look after them.
- You have to trust me on this.
- Trust?
This isn't me.
Where's Heather?
She's fine. I told her we were making
the trip. She didn't want to come.
Truth.
If anything happens to any of them,
you're the first one I come for.
I know.

<i>Previously on </i>Jericho
When were you planning
on telling me about the baby?
A bad marriage doesn't get better
because you add a kid.
I didn't want you to stay with me
because of the baby, Eric.
Heather!
My God.
Uh... Jake, this is Ted Lewis.
We grew up together
over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.
I'm going to help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.
- Just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.
I have something
in my possession
and it puts you, me and the kids
in danger here.
Sarah is not on our side.
She's not here to help us.
Hawkins is starting
to put the pieces together.
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
Why are you stalling on this one?
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?
I won't follow you.
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.
Honey, you look tired.
You getting enough sleep?
Almost seven hours.
- Where?
- In my office.
Sleeping in your office
doesn't count.
You're going to give
the baby a crick in its neck.
You're going to make
a terrific grandmother.
- I know.
- You're Dr. Green? - Yes.
Jessica Williams.
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Ostrowski says
he's having chest pains.
He doesn't want anybody
to look at him but you.
Are you the doctor
who came in with the refugees?
Close. Third-year med student,
University of Chicago.
And I prefer
"visitor" to "refugee."
I'm sorry.
Thanks for the help.
Don't thank me.
I'm just working here
'cause I get to sleep in a bed
instead of the church basement.
Where do I start?
Pneumonia,
malnutrition, hypothermia.
Just grab a chart
and pick a patient.
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Hey, Jim.
Hope I didn't wake the kids.
No, you're okay.
Mine are the same way.
Up at all hours.
Worse when we had TV.
Is there something
I can do for you, Jim?
Sorry. Um...
Mayor Anderson wants me
to keep track of the refugees.
You know,
find out where they end up.
See what kind of work
they're doing to help the town.
Sarah Mason.
She's been...
staying with you, right?
Mr. Hawkins...
It's freezing out here. Uh...
Is she around?
- Oh, the generator's back on.
- Thank God.
Well, that's it.
We're on our last tank of diesel.
Power's out to everything
but the medical center.
Our last tank?
How long will we have power?
Ten, maybe 12 hours,
so turn off anything
you're not using.
What about the biodiesel?
We burned through it.
We're not going
to have any more for days.
We need to come up
with another plan.
We're getting more and
more people in here every...
Oh, God!
April, can you hear me?
Is she breathing?
April, wake up!
Get over here!

It's colder than a witch's patootie.
Using candles.
I saw you had some electric lights on
when I was walking up.
I got a geni
in the basement, but, uh...
I just used the last of my gas.
What were you doing?
I'm putting some stuff
in storage, but, uh...
I was just cleaning up.
Using the last of your fuel
on housework, huh?
Darcy's trained you well.
Listen, Jimmy, um...
I was just about to turn in, so...
Right. Sorry.
Uh, well, like I said,
Mayor Anderson's got me keeping
tabs on the refugees, you know.
Crime's up.
So, Sarah Mason.
Is she here?
Can I ask her some questions?
You know, um...
Sarah left yesterday.
Something about, uh...
family in New Orleans.
Wow. In this weather?
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.
Hey, don't worry about it.
You know, that's a...
nasty- looking cut
you got there.
Uh, yeah, it was, uh...
tree branch when
I was cutting wood.
- Must have been a real bleeder.
- Hey, it's not too deep.
Well, you be careful.
It's dangerous out there.
Again, sorry to bother you.
Yes.
I don't feel good.
I'm so tired all of a sudden.
I know.
I told you you need
to get some rest.
Here's your big chance.
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you, honey.
I'm trying to keep her calm,
but my gut tells me
the baby's having a problem,
and if I know it, she knows it.
- What are we going to do?
- Get Kenchy?
There's another doctor in town?
The man can barely
sit up on his bar stool.
Look, what I really need is
an ultrasound machine.
Without it, there's no real way
to know what's going on.
Well, maybe we have one that
survived the EMP in the basement.
- I'll go look.
- Good.
You go get your father
and tell him to find Eric.
He's the one who should be here.
It's the guys from New Bern.
They actually built the thing.
I can't believe it.
Hey, Russell.
- Hey. Sheriff, good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Johnston, you SOB.
- How the hell did you lose an election?
- No, the question is,
how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Well, this is our new mayor.
This is Gray Anderson.
- Mayor Anderson.
- Nice to meet you.
Congratulations.
Thank you. Thank you.
So, this is the windmill, huh?
It's a power-generating wind turbine.
We get about 1,500 watts an hour
out of one of these.
- Have you seen Eric?
- No, did you try Mary's?
Yeah. I tried there.
I tried at Bailey's.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably some time tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
I think we're going to need it
at the medical center.
- You got it.
- There's something wrong with April.
What? What is it?
She passed out. They think
there's a problem with the baby.
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
I'll walk.
Stanley thinks that you're using
this whole volunteering thing
as an excuse
to see Sean Henthorn.
I'm just following orders
to keep an eye on you.
Personally, I don't give
a damn who you date.
I've been volunteering here
since I was 16.
It's not about Sean.
You volunteer for anything? Ever?
Mr. Fredrickson.
Come on, stop.
Gracie gave you beet seed
in exchange for 3% of your farm crop.
That 3% is mine now.
The store was left to me.
I can't do that, Dale.
Things have gotten worse now.
I need it for my family,
to feed the last of my livestock.
I'm sorry.
It's the law, Mr. Fredrickson.
It's rightfully mine.
There are no more laws, son.
No.
I volunteered.
So. What do I do?
Empty. Clean. Repeat.
Where the hell is Eric?
Nobody knows.
Dad's getting Bill on it.
Her blood pressure's dropping.
- I'm feeling contractions.
- I think she's going into labor.
No, no, I can't.
The baby's only 16 weeks.
I need, I need ritodrine
to stop the labor.
I already checked.
We don't have any more.
I'll try to find some nifedipine.
All right, now what are you feeling?
If I lose consciousness,
and you can't find any medicine,
use alcohol.
What do you mean?
What kind of alcohol?
Anything coming out of the still.
Give me a 10% drip.
It'll stop the contractions.
Oh, God, she's bleeding.
Get Kenchy. Now!
I'm so cold my mouth is numb.
We need the logs or we're
going to freeze to death.
Isn't that what we're doing now?
All right. Let's get in the car.
Blanket.
Let's turn on the heat.
We can't. I'm sorry.
We won't have enough gas to get home.
You know, we could make our own heat.
Don't get any ideas...
I'm not taking my clothes off.
You know how happy you make me.
I'm still not taking my clothes off.
Come on!
What's her pressure?
- You smell like a wino.
- Nice to meet you too.
- What's her pressure, please ?
- 80/44 and dropping.
- Is she dilated?
- Two centimeters.
Her contractions are six minutes apart.
I need an ultrasound.
I brought some old ones
up from the basement.
I'll go check on them now.
- Do we have fresh plasma?
- No.
I need you to find somebody...
- With O-negative blood.
- Yes.
And we need
a fetal heart monitor.
Do we have that?
No?
I need you to put these on
and monitor the baby's heart rate.
Here, put these in your ear.
I'll show you how to listen.
I'm deaf.
Madam?
I need you to put these in ears.
I need you to monitor
the baby's heart rate.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I will show you how.
Come on, let's go! Please!
Here we go. Put these on.
Listen right here.
Now, the higher one,
the fast one.
You hear that?
That's the baby's heart rate.
You count 15 seconds,
and then you multiply
that by four.
- To get the beats per minute.
- Perfect
now I will show you
how to take blood pressure
and pulse rate.
All right, let's get ready to lift it.
You want me to settle
a contract dispute?!
Mr. Fredrickson isn't giving
Dale his share.
You're kidding me, right?
I'm trying to get power restored.
I got home robberies all over town.
The refugees are threatening
to break into the food lockup.
Okay, we're going to go on three.
One...
two...
three.
There we go.
A little higher, a little higher.
Okay, easy
Got it.
Watch the rope.
There you go.
Keep it going.
Almost there.
You got enough on your side?
Keep it taut.
Good job, fellas.
How's the baby?
I don't know.
How close is this?
I don't know, hours, at least.
Did you find Eric?
No. Bill and the rangers
are out looking for him.
Can we buy some more of these things?
Yeah. Let's talk about it.
<i>Mr. Hawkins!</i>
<i>I'm back!</i>
<i>Mr. Hawkins, you around?</i>
Just a second!
You weren't answering
your front door, so I just...
You doing some yard work?
You need a hand?
No. No, thank you.
I was going to turn some compost.
Getting ready to plant
food for the spring.
That's a good idea.
Margaret's planting carrots inside.
They're a super-food,
you know...
like broccoli.
You need something, Jimmy?
Gray wants me to find out
what kind of resources
Sarah might've taken with her, you know?
Fuel, food. Did she...
drive out of town?
- She didn't drive.
Took a backpack.
Some food...
a tent.
Then just walked out into the cold, huh?
That's crazy.
Maybe Darcy knows something more.
No, I don't think so.
I just figured,
you know, women talk, and who knows
what the hell they say, right?
Is Darcy around?
Can I...
can I speak with her?
Darcy and I are having problems.
She's moved out.
Boy, that's tough.
A lot of people leaving you lately, huh?
I'm-I'm sorry.
That's insensitive. I...
I will get my coat.
I'll take you to her, Jimmy.
Really?
<i>Hey, how are your, uh,
communication skills?</i>
You know, 'cause that's really
what marriage is all about.
<i>Honesty, love.</i>
<i>I'd say it's 50-50.</i>
<i>Sort of like half and half, you know?</i>
Well, actually, more like thirds,
if you throw respect in there.
<i>But not equal thirds, 'cause honesty...</i>
<i>is more important than
the love and the respect.</i>
<i>I think.</i>
You got one of the only
salt mines around for 400 miles.
A year without salt, and New Bern
will be a ghost town.
What are we talking about,
a couple hundred pounds?
No, we need a lot more than that.
- We're going to need food.
- No food to spare.
Won't see another crop till spring.
Spring crop's what I'm talking about.
Ten wind turbines for,
let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.
Spring crop might not even
get us to next year.
If we lose ten percent, we'll just be
in the same position we are now.
Worse.
Look, all we're asking you
to do is be reasonable.
Well, we're just trying to survive.
Starve next fall or freeze
this winter...
take your pick.
Vancomycin... good.
Start a drip: 250 milligrams IV.
I'll do it.
We found four people who are O-negative.
- Fetal heart rate is 169.
- I'll get it off the ultrasound.
Her blood pressure is 130/70.
Her respiratory rate is 18,
and her pulse is 88, it's going up.
She's losing blood.
Her heart's compensating
by pumping harder.
Start an IV for the blood.
What do you see?
- Placenta previa.
- What's that?
The placenta is covering
the entire cervix.
There's no way for me to find out
where the bleed is coming from
unless we operate.
Well, what are we going to do?
Under the best of circumstances,
this is not an operating facility.
- Then we don't have a choice.
- Cannot operate here.
Why?
I have been through this more times
than you could possibly imagine.
We've all been through a lot, all right?
Just tell us...
I have seen
hundreds of people die
because of dirty facilities
and infection
and because I didn't have
the proper medicine
or the equipment
that I needed.
I am not doing it again.
We are not losing this baby.
You can find yourself another butcher.
There's got to be a way.
Kenchy. Listen,
we need a sterile operating room,
sterile instruments,
anesthesia, spinal block tray,
caesarian tray.
Have you ever even seen a surgery
performed without
an electrocautery machine?
No, you haven't. Because
this doesn't even taught anymore.
Can't we just use laparotomy
sponges to stop the bleeding?
God, my head is killing me.
We've got several spinal block trays,
and we've got anesthesia.
And we can boil
the sheets and the tools.
Is it possible?
- Remotely.
- Then start.
- We need bleach.
- What?
Bleach.
You know? Bleach.
Bonnie, look at my lips.
Bleach !
Learn.
Is that the word for "bleach"?
No.
"Bitch."
And... "please."
And "sorry."
I'm heading out.
If I'm not back, lock up at dark
and don't let anyone in.
Also, if I'm not around ever
and you need anything,
just talk to Gail Green or Johnston.
You can trust them.
I'm going to come with you.
Why?
Two against one.
Hey, Bill.
What's wrong?
I just jumped in.
It was...
It was just in the moment.
You volunteered at the medical center
long before I ever get here.
It's fine.
Kenchy just doesn't know you.
Everybody else respects you.
They speak your language.
- Hey, we got a problem.
- What's that?
Eddie and Frank are asking
how come you're not making the deal.
Words are gonna start to spread.
As far as they know,
the marines said that
the army corp of engineers would
be here within the month.
What difference does it make if we give
New Bern a part of next year's profit?
They think there's going
to be food by then.
You didn't want to tell them it was
a bunch of crap, so now what do we do?
All right,
maybe we should tell the town
that help's not coming.
We just told them that to give 'em
something to get through winter.
Town's already on the edge,
you'll have anarchy.
And I'm not leverage
next winter's food,
that'd be suicide.
What if we tell New Bern that
we'll give them
10% of next year's crop.
We get power now.
If next year we don't have
the food to give, we don't give it up.
That's how wars get started.
I can't believe Darcy is staying
at the refugee shelter.
Hey, Jim,
let me talk to her a second.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I asked you to stay away.
Jimmy wanted to ask you
some questions...
about Sarah.
Where are the kids?
They're in the gym, playing.
We need a consistent cover story.
What'd you do with her body?
I buried her.
So I can tell them that right now,
and never see you again.
I could tell him about...
- What did you call it... "the package"?
- Stop it!
You understand the story?
Family? New Orleans?
And you don't know
anything else about her.
This'll just take a sec.
Yeah, well, I don't want
to talk to you in front of him.
Why don't you give us
a minute, Mr. Hawkins?
I'll be out front...
let you two talk.
You're going to be okay, angel.
Did you ever do
a surgical rotation?
Only in school.
Most of my career was in post-op.
I feel obligated to ask you
if you're sober enough to do this.
You can talk me through it.
You will refer to me
as Dr. Dhuwalia, Nurse.
And my sobriety is not the issue.
The people I call "doctor"
don't smell like a brewery.
Respirations are 16.
Pulse rate is 82.
Her blood pressure's down to 100/62.
God help us.
- Is the baby okay?
- I don't know.
Mom said there's a problem.
We were just
collecting firewood.
You don't have
to explain it to me.
What about Mom?
Don't worry about that.
Shut the door.
We're losing too much blood.
Clamp it off.
Get away from the incision!
I need to hear
if the baby's in distress.
Get away from the incision.
You haven't let me get
a pulse from this baby in an hour.
Respirations are 16, pulse is 84.
Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.
You're not close enough to the fetus.
It's not an accurate measurement.
The placenta's grown into
the uterus wall. It's ripping away.
- That's what's causing the bleeding.
- Now I've lost it.
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?
The baby's heart beat has stopped.
- What do you mean, it's stopped?
- Do something.
That must be
the last of the diesel.
Open the door.
Open the blinds.
I need light.
Why aren't you doing
something about the baby?
This hasn't been about
the baby for several hours.
The baby never really had a chance.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you saying?
I am trying to save April.
- What do you want?
- Same thing as before.
- My share of the crop.
- I told you I can't do that. Go home.
I'm only asking for what's mine.
You said there's no law, right?
I'm not trying to cheat anybody.
I don't have that much left.
Then give my share
of whatever you got.
Right now.
- What's going on?
- I... I just...
need some space right now.
We lost the baby.
Oh, sweetie...
I need to be
with April right now.
What took you so long?
Well after...
talking with Darcy, uh...
a lot of things are starting
to make sense now.
You all right, Mr. Hawkins?
I'm fine.
Well, Darcy said...
that Sarah left for New Orleans,
just like you told me.
What? You think I was lying?
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.
She doesn't need
to be staying in the shelter.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
We found a body, Robert.
Out in the woods.
Near Mill Creek.
Broken neck.
Animals got to it.
Michael Connor was on patrol,
said he saw
an African-American woman
driving out that way
a couple nights ago.
Perfect description of Sarah Mason.
Really?
Think she could do
something like that?
I don't know.
You know,
I'm learning that, uh...
it's hard to figure what
people are capable of, Jimmy.
Well, our John Doe was bald.
Know anyone looks like that?
If Sarah comes back...
we'd really, really
like to talk to her.
My guess is...
she's not coming back.
That'd be my guess, too.
New Bern's all made of clay,
can't grow nothing.
We need 10% of your spring crop,
and 700 pounds refined salt.
Well, y-you said 500 earlier.
- Price went up.
- Why?
Because that's what
power costs in this world.
Oh, now, come on...
We got people freezing
to death in their homes.
Give us a break.
You were at my son's wedding.
I'm sorry for your troubles.
But we got our own.
We'll give you the food.
We'll give you the salt.
Everything.
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.
What guarantee do we have
you'll give us our share of the crop?
You have our word.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
We can take them
back with us now.
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?
Human beings as collateral?
I would never do that.
But I am not going
to build these things on credit.
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.
Just hold the pressure.
Put pressure right there.
Right there.
Press, harder!
Damn it! I can't see!
I- I'll get another lantern.
You can bring ten lanterns.
Doesn't make any difference.
It's not going to be enough.
I need real light!
Blood pressure is down to 66/30.
This is crazy.
This is crazy. Close her up.
But we haven't stopped
the bleeding.
- What are you doing?
- Give her some peace.
Give her some dignity.
You are not giving up on her.
I'm sorry.
Close this up.
Where do you think you're going?
You get back inside, right now!
- Come on!
- Take it easy.
Take it easy, all right?
Just let me handle this.
Let me handle it.
What are you doing?
You want me to say it
in front of him?
Go back inside, all right?
April needs you.
To go on operating
is cruel and pointless.
Don't even ask me, Jake.
I'm done with this.
I became a plastic surgeon
so I could have the simple, easy life
that other man face.
- Not in this town.
- I don't care.
I'm not going through this anymore.
It is madness.
And everyone here
can just go to hell?
If you stop trying, and I stop,
then they see that.
And this whole thing falls apart.
We're all leaning on each other here,
whether you like it or not.
Promise me
you are not saying
that we're all connected.
This is not some existential,
web-of-life BS.
That is not what I'm hearing,
is it, Jake?
Then tell me
what you want to hear.
'Cause I'll say anything,
if you'll just go back in there
and keep trying.
She's going to die.
I know.
Okay. New gloves.
Let's get this bleeding
stopped, shall we?
- Well, we've got more sponges.
- Excellent!
Pack them in others vascular bleeding.
Just give me time to suture.
He's going to need you.
Now.
Hold my hand.
I'm right here.
I'm right next to you.
I like the name Tracy.
Tracy's a beautiful name.
Thank you for not saying anything.
I didn't do it for you,
I did it for Allison.
I need my family to come home.
I, uh...
I need you.
You know, in the last
three months,
I remembered all the reasons
why I need you in my life.
So have I.
I've also remembered
why it can never work.
I need truth, Robert, and that's
something you've never given me.
- Everything I do, I do for us.
- Listen.
When you hide a part of yourself,
I don't care what the reason is...
it puts something between us.
Please.
My daughter just killed a woman.
I don't have any more trust to give you.
So, I got the kids with
Margaret back at the house.
What can I carry?
This.
Hang in there.
I got faith in you guys.
Sorry?
The wind turbine's working.
Mrs. Hodges, how are you doing?
- Not so hot.
- Let's get you checked out again.
Dr. Dhuwalia.
Mrs. Hodges' cough is worse.
Her temperature is 102.
- Hello, Mrs. Hodges.
- I'm Dr. Dhuwalia.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Why don't you go outside
and get a pan of boiling hot water
build a tent with a sheet. We need to
get this lady breathing some moist air.
Take a deep breath.
There we go.
That was incredible!
Did you see the look on his face?
I know, I thought he
was going to have a heart attack,
and we were going to have
to drive him to the medical center.
I think we're going to be okay.
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to be there...
with you.
<i>You men are the only ones
who really know what's going on here.</i>
When New Bern gets
their share of the spring crop,
you'll be allowed to return.
I know that sounds like a long time,
but what you are about to do
means this town's survival.
Now you've...
I know your families want some time
to say good-bye. So let's get going.
Promise me something...
Promise you won't kill
Mimi while I'm gone.
And you'll give her food.
Why do you have to go?
People are going to die if we
don't get these wind turbines...
You're all have.
I'll be back.
Take care of Bonnie, okay?
Look, I just want to tell you something.
- And don't freak out, okay?
- I won't.
In this...
crazy world we don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow and...
I don't wanna leave
anything unsaid, so...
I'm just going to say it, okay?
So here I go...
I've loved you since the
first day I saw you at Bailey's.
You said it... you said it first.
No one's ever said
it first to me before.
I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow, and...
Plus,
I can hold it over you
for the rest of our lives.
I love you, Stanley Richmond.
But I said it first.
It wasn't your fault, Eric.
You don't have to do this.
I can't be here right now.
I can't.
Take care, son.
Be strong.
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mom.
We'll take care of Mary.
All right, let's move out.
My dad told me what's happening.
First you're helping us, and now this...
What the hell's going on?
They're going to be fine.
I'm going to look after them.
- You have to trust me on this.
- Trust?
This isn't me.
Where's Heather?
She's fine. I told her we were making
the trip. She didn't want to come.
Truth.
If anything happens to any of them,
you're the first one I come for.
I know.

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Some of them were on planes
that landed in the middle of nowhere.
They've been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
Oh, my God.
At the current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that
Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team sold us all out.
You're smart enough to know
that they would say anything
to get you to talk, Sarah.
Get the package.
We're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.
... and those are to restore lights,
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.
Something's wrong about all this,
all right? Trust me.
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.
Is any of this real?
- The gun's real.
- Hands up. Get them up!
What the hell do we do with them?
You will leave your weapons on the tank,
and you will move out!
- What do we do with that?
- Stanley,
got room in your barn?
- Seriously?
- Why not?
Never know when you might need a tank.
You're making too much noise.
Sorry.
Where did it go?
There it is.
- It's locked.
- We shouldn't go in.
Go in here.
- Why do I have to?
- So we can eat.
You see it?
Katie?
<i>Come on, Jake,
there's a line here.
<i>Did you hear about the tank?
<i>Those Marines coming or what?
<i>Everybody, just calm down!
You'll get your share.
<i>You'll get your rations!
<i>People, please, back up!
How is Gray handling this?
You better get in there.
I think we really screwed
ourselves this time.
You said everyone in the shelter gets
half-rations until the Marines come.
Well, the Marines aren't coming,
and you've known all along.
We did the best that we could.
People had to believe
that help was on the way.
And you know what?
Half-rations is a lot more than
those refugees had before they got here.
Did you know about this?
The Marines...
That they were con artists?
Yeah, but we didn't give them
any of our supplies.
And Gray is right. The last thing
this town needs is to lose hope.
Hope won't keep
my friends from starving.
I've got one woman too weak to walk.
It's a mathematical problem.
We've got your friends,
plus another 50 who migrated here.
That's too many people,
and not enough food.
We'll just have to figure out
how to make what we have last.
I say the first thing we do,
is stop giving it away to strangers.
What if we cut
the food rations in half,
again?
It's more than the food.
What about medicine?
Those refugees came here sick.
They've been burning through
our meds for a month.
Can we make it to spring, Harry?
Some of us can. Not all.
Crime's been going up
since they got here.
Crime's been going up
since the bombs.
It's got to be done.
The numbers speak for themselves.
Just look at 'em.
I don't need to look at 'em.
I see them in my sleep.
What are you going to do?
Folks?
Folks, listen up!
I am sorry to say that
the town no longer has the resources
to take care of you.
<i>What?
Where are we supposed to go?
So if you could please
gather up your belongings,
you will be escorted
to a FEMA camp out
- near I-70.
- We've been to those FEMA camps.
We barely made it out
alive the first time.
FEMA has medicine and supplies,
and we don't.
You heard the mayor.
You need to start packing up.
What are you going to do,
put us in jail?
Great.
If I didn't have to do this,
- I wouldn't.
- We've been working!
Okay? We've been chopping wood!
Jessica's been helping you
with your medical center.
I'm sorry.
But if you put us out on the...
This isn't a debate.
You're right.
'Cause we're staying.

Anything?
Static.
No news.
I guess now the secret
about the tank is out,
there's no need to hide the radio.
Yeah. I'll take it down
to Bailey's later.
We can all be annoyed together.
Emily.
Gray's trying to kick out the refugees.
They barricaded themselves
inside the church.
Was anybody hurt?
Is there another door?
No. They blocked that one, too.
Look, Roger, I'm sorry, but...
You lie about the Marines,
you get caught, you need someone
to blame, so you pick them.
We have taken in almost
a hundred people since the bombs.
Roger, you brought over 50 yourself.
We've done our part.
It's time for somebody else
to share the burden.
- Now, these FEMA camps...
- Those FEMA camps are jungles.
Putting anybody out on those streets
is a death sentence.
You've been out there.
You know that.
Look, it comes down to ressources.
All right? And people of Jericho
have to come first.
It's 100 of them or 100 of us.
Let me work on Gray.
You and Emily try and talk
some sense into the refugees.
Don't give Gray
a reason to make this worse.
All right? Gray can't send
these people away like this.
It's his call.
Well, isn't there
something we can do?
Give them warm clothing for the trip.
We've given away
everything we can spare.
Well, there's...
What?
April's things?
Kyle, what are you doing?
We're not leaving here without a fight.
- This is a bad idea.
- What should we do?
We take down the barricade.
We go out unarmed.
We look them in the eye,
and we ask them to stay
till the end of winter.
Look them in the eye.
That's your plan?
- You don't know this town.
- Apparently, that makes two of us.
Where did you get the food from?
You stole it.
You broke into people's houses?
It's not like you didn't do the same
thing when we were out there.
Yeah, well, this is different.
This town took care of us!
We took care of us!
Because we knew,
one day, this town wouldn't.
What do you see?
Looks like Simmons has got
his nephew guarding the shed.
I don't think I can get in.
You have to.
You traded them for that gas,
and they're holding out on you.
You can't let these farmers
get away with it anymore.
It's easy for you to say.
I'll go this time.
Very funny.
What? You think you're
the only badass here?
- Uh... yeah.
- You want to bet?
Forget it, Skylar. Simmons is not
a pushover like Frederickson.
Neither am I.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You could get hurt.
You're worried about me?
That's so sweet.
Now, watch and learn.
Found them!
Tear gas?
Gray, those things been
sitting around for years.
You can't do this, Gray.
I've given these people sanctuary.
Reverend, this is a police matter now.
You have no right
to assault these people.
They've committed no crimes.
- They'll be my responsibility.
- What, are you going to feed them?
What, you got a little hospital
down there, Reverend?
No, I didn't think so.
What's that sound?
They're boarding up the windows.
There were half a dozen other places
we could have stopped,
but you kept talking like Jericho
was the end of the freakin' rainbow.
So we kept walking...
losing people... for this.
Out of my way, Johnston!
I know what I'm doing.
You know why we never used those?
A little thing called Waco happened.
The FBI used tear gas,
and they swear it didn't start
that fire, but it could have.
- You ready to live with that?
- Dad!
We can't hold off a town.
- It's too big a gamble.
- It's not a gamble for you!
You get to go home
to a warm bed every night.
I told you... I'm with you.
What happens when
we get kicked out of this town?
<i>Come on!
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!
<i>She's got no pulse.
Hank! Hank!
- Skylar!
- Thank God. There are men on the road!
- Men? What men?
- They're with Ravenwood.
Is your uncle here?
- No, it's just me.
- We have to hide!
Okay, yeah. Come on!
How many were there?
I don't know. Five, maybe six.
I can't see them.
You know what?
I bet you have
a better view from the hayloft.
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.
Skylar!
Stop!
It's okay. I'll wait.
One of the refugees is still out there.
You have the rangers search the barns.
Use dogs if it'll help.
And the rest of them?
Take them to the med center,
get them fixed up, Harry.
Then send them away.
What about the extra food
you promised them?
Give it to them.
- After what they did to us?
- Will you just do it,
before somebody else gets hurt?!
It's not too late.
Just let them stay until spring.
You think I haven't tried
to make that work?
The numbers don't add up.
- They're good people, Gray. Just...
- And?!
Good people are dying every day!
Someone finally has to tell the truth.
It's musical chairs out there.
The music has stopped!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, get away from me!
Get away from me!
A hundred counts of murder, Gray.
That's what they should charge you with
if you send them away.
We have been feeding them
and we have been heating the shelter.
We've been taking
from my friends
to give to strangers,
so don't you dare lecture me!
Whatever happens to them is on you!
Let me go, please!
- I don't want to hurt you!
- Just let me go, please!
You're not leaving
until this is resolved!
This is resolved!
Get out of my way!
- They're not going anywhere.
- You want to bet?
Just take whatever you want!
Just get out!
And go where?!
I got the entire police force
guarding the refugees,
and one way or another,
they're going.
Hey, stop it!
All right, stop it!
What's going on?
What happened?
Gray pulled a gun.
It was an accident.
Like hell! He shot me!
There's so much blood.
He needs a doctor.
- Get-get Kenchy.
- No, get Jessica.
Shut up!
You're not running things!
Get Jessica, please, all right?
I trust her.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
What are you looking for?
Superglue.
The sole on my boot came apart
after a couple hundred miles.
My son's shoes might fit you.
I'd rather fix these.
Why?
They're all I have left that are mine.
Where are you going to go?
I don't know really.
My family was in Chicago.
I wish there was more
that we could do.
Ma'am,
there are empty houses
all over Jericho,
and we sleep in a shelter.
Those are our neighbors' homes.
They were gone
when the bombs went off.
They're coming back.
Well, wherever your neighbors are,
I hope nobody's kicking them
out of town in the middle of winter.
What the hell happened in there?
- Gray's bleeding badly.
- I'm busy.
- I need your help!
- Get Kenchy.
Look, you're the only
one Roger trusts.
You want me to save
Gray Anderson?
If Gray dies, so does Roger.
People aren't just going
to let it go. Please?
We can all get out of this.
I was just trying to help them.
Now... there's no way the
town lets them stay.
It was an accident.
I saw it.
Gray...
just until spring.
That's all I ask.
Come on!
You were right.
This is on me.
I brought them here.
I did it...
I did it for my own reasons.
But don't punish them,
I'm begging you.
Just till spring.
Go to hell.
I've got Jessica. Let us in.
You need to let me look at him.
You give them a chance...
...I'll give you a chance.
I was going to give you
food, an escort.
We wouldn't survive out there...
you know that.
We have to stay here.
Why would you die over this?!
He's our only leverage.
Roger, this isn't you.
I survived out there
for three months.
You have no idea what
I can do if I have to.
- Any sign of her?
- No.
Check the buildings.
She's got to be around
here somewhere.
Hold up.
She changed the location again.
Meet you back at the road.
Bill, don't!
You think I want to?
Roger's a friend of mine, but I can't
let the mayor bleed to death.
What if you miss?
What if you hit Emily?
Get off me.
If I get the shot, Jake...
I'm taking it.
Damn it.
We have to get him help.
He didn't want to do this.
It doesn't matter what
we want, does it?
It matters what we do.
I tried to get us all back here.
I promised them if we
just stuck together.
- And you did.
- Yeah.
Emily, most of us made it back.
19 of us didn't.
What's going on?
And I remember...
every one of their faces.
- Get away from the window!
- Jake, what are you doing?!
- I told you to stay out!
- Get away from the window!
Get away from the window!
Roger, get away from
the window!
Roger, get away from
the window!
If you want your friends to live...
you better back the hell off
right now and listen to me!
Roger, he's here to help.
I'm listening.
What if we give you
transportation?
And food and fuel?
So we can die out there?
- Guy is that what you think about?
- No!
You can make it to
the migration trail.
Head south and beat the winter.
It's not your decision to make.
Won't be yours either if you're dead.
You can't keep us in here forever.
This will end.
And when it does,
you can forget about staying.
They will kick you out
with nothing.
I'm going to need guns.
I can't give you guns.
I can't protect a hundred
people with what I have.
But you let Jessica take Gray
to the medical center.
He's not leaving.
Roger, if that bullet is still in him,
I'm going to have to open him up.
Is it a deal?
You make sure everything's ready.
I'll let him go.
Hey, Allie.
Dad, you can't be around here.
Mom will freak out.
I won't stay long.
Come on.
So...
I just wanted to know
how you were doing.
Settling in okay at
Jimmy's place?
- Yeah, he just never stops talking.
- No...
He doesn't.
ow's Sam?
You know, he gets scared.
And you?
I'm fine.
Look...
that thing you had
to do to Sarah...
I know how that can
change people.
Dad...
don't worry about me.
I'm not Sam, and
I'm not Mom.
So...
you're not going to live with
us anymore... are you ?
I don't think it's a good
idea right now.
Then don't worry.
I'll take care of them.
Come here.
You are not me.
Thank you for helping me.
Just try to keep still.
It's my job, you know.
I didn't want to do it.
I had to.
We all have our jobs to do,
whether we want to do them or not.
Just hang on.
The bus is here.
When do you think you'll come back?
After this...
he's never going to
let me come back.
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought them here.
There were other places...
camps...
towns we heard about.
But I had to see you.
A refugee broke into the house.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'll get the guys.
Listen to me.
We can't let this happen.
We're ready.
Get up.
Wait, you can't take him.
Once my friends and I...
are safely out of town...
I'll let him go.
He'll be dead by then.
You can't let them go out there.
A woman died on Main Street today.
I didn't even know her name.
Did you?
If you need a hostage,
take me.
Think of our neighbors who
haven't made it back yet.
That's who they are.
Now my family can feed two people.
Now my family can feed two people.
Who else here is willing
to share their rations?
They're coming out!
All right, move back!
Move back!
Come on, people, we can do this.
I know we can, please.
Thank you, Bob. Yeah.
Right. Good.
Who else?
Come on, who else? Please.
Please.
Everybody, get back!
Get back!
Keep your guns down.
Keep them down.
Move back!
Move back!
- Move back!
- My God.
Roger...
it's over.
They can stay.
We found them homes.
Just put the gun down, Roger.
You won.
Come on, put it down.
How's the mayor?
Jessica did a great job.
He's, um...
he's lost a lot of blood,
but he's stable.
We talked him into letting
the others stay.
But, um...
Not me.
Well...
I'd say I'd call you, but...
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Roger, I-I am, so...
I did this
so the people I love
can be safe here.
I'm not taking the person I love
the most out on those roads.
I can handle it.
I can't.
So... what do you think?
Well, it's no Saks Fifth Avenue,
but...
it's pretty great.
Thanks to all the deals we made,
we have a real trading post now.
Hi, Mr. Simmons.
Hank.
- What?!
You think this is a joke?
I could've shot you.
Talk to your uncle, Hank.
He's the one that broke the deal.
You're just a real big man,
aren't you?
Just give me my horse
and the gas, and I'll be on my way.
The horse is tied up in the alley,
but the gas is mine.
I'm through playing
games with you.
Hank, get the gas.
Meet my new employees.
This is, um,
Jim and Judy Moore's house.
They were visiting their grandchildren
just outside of Philadelphia.
Rations are on Tuesday.
We'll be by to share them with you.
Mrs. Green.
Thank you.
We got together
some canned food and water.
I wish I had more.
Nothing I say is going to...
is going to sound right, so...
Are you really sad to see me go?
It's not about that.
Here.
Take Cedar Run first, it's clear,
and then head to New Bern.
Heather, Stanley, my brother,
they can help you
once you're there.
I know my way around.

- So we can eat.
You see it?
Katie?
<i>Come on, Jake,
there's a line here.
<i>Did you hear about the tank?
<i>Those Marines coming or what?
<i>Everybody, just calm down!
You'll get your share.
<i>You'll get your rations!
<i>People, please, back up!
How is Gray handling this?
You better get in there.
I think we really screwed
ourselves this time.
You said everyone in the shelter gets
half-rations until the Marines come.
Well, the Marines aren't coming,
and you've known all along.
We did the best that we could.
People had to believe
that help was on the way.
And you know what?
Half-rations is a lot more than
those refugees had before they got here.
Did you know about this?
The Marines...
That they were con artists?
Yeah, but we didn't give them
any of our supplies.
And Gray is right. The last thing
this town needs is to lose hope.
Hope won't keep
my friends from starving.
I've got one woman too weak to walk.
It's a mathematical problem.
We've got your friends,
plus another 50 who migrated here.
That's too many people,
and not enough food.
We'll just have to figure out
how to make what we have last.
I say the first thing we do,
is stop giving it away to strangers.
What if we cut
the food rations in half,
again?
It's more than the food.
What about medicine?
Those refugees came here sick.
They've been burning through
our meds for a month.
Can we make it to spring, Harry?
Some of us can. Not all.
Crime's been going up
since they got here.
Crime's been going up
since the bombs.
It's got to be done.
The numbers speak for themselves.
Just look at 'em.
I don't need to look at 'em.
I see them in my sleep.
What are you going to do?
Folks?
Folks, listen up!
I am sorry to say that
the town no longer has the resources
to take care of you.
<i>What?
Where are we supposed to go?
So if you could please
gather up your belongings,
you will be escorted
to a FEMA camp out
- near I-70.
- We've been to those FEMA camps.
We barely made it out
alive the first time.
FEMA has medicine and supplies,
and we don't.
You heard the mayor.
You need to start packing up.
What are you going to do,
put us in jail?
Great.
If I didn't have to do this,
- I wouldn't.
- We've been working!
Okay? We've been chopping wood!
Jessica's been helping you
with your medical center.
I'm sorry.
But if you put us out on the...
This isn't a debate.
You're right.
'Cause we're staying.

Anything?
Static.
No news.
I guess now the secret
about the tank is out,
there's no need to hide the radio.
Yeah. I'll take it down
to Bailey's later.
We can all be annoyed together.
Emily.
Gray's trying to kick out the refugees.
They barricaded themselves
inside the church.
Was anybody hurt?
Is there another door?
No. They blocked that one, too.
Look, Roger, I'm sorry, but...
You lie about the Marines,
you get caught, you need someone
to blame, so you pick them.
We have taken in almost
a hundred people since the bombs.
Roger, you brought over 50 yourself.
We've done our part.
It's time for somebody else
to share the burden.
- Now, these FEMA camps...
- Those FEMA camps are jungles.
Putting anybody out on those streets
is a death sentence.
You've been out there.
You know that.
Look, it comes down to ressources.
All right? And people of Jericho
have to come first.
It's 100 of them or 100 of us.
Let me work on Gray.
You and Emily try and talk
some sense into the refugees.
Don't give Gray
a reason to make this worse.
All right? Gray can't send
these people away like this.
It's his call.
Well, isn't there
something we can do?
Give them warm clothing for the trip.
We've given away
everything we can spare.
Well, there's...
What?
April's things?
Kyle, what are you doing?
We're not leaving here without a fight.
- This is a bad idea.
- What should we do?
We take down the barricade.
We go out unarmed.
We look them in the eye,
and we ask them to stay
till the end of winter.
Look them in the eye.
That's your plan?
- You don't know this town.
- Apparently, that makes two of us.
Where did you get the food from?
You stole it.
You broke into people's houses?
It's not like you didn't do the same
thing when we were out there.
Yeah, well, this is different.
This town took care of us!
We took care of us!
Because we knew,
one day, this town wouldn't.
What do you see?
Looks like Simmons has got
his nephew guarding the shed.
I don't think I can get in.
You have to.
You traded them for that gas,
and they're holding out on you.
You can't let these farmers
get away with it anymore.
It's easy for you to say.
I'll go this time.
Very funny.
What? You think you're
the only badass here?
- Uh... yeah.
- You want to bet?
Forget it, Skylar. Simmons is not
a pushover like Frederickson.
Neither am I.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You could get hurt.
You're worried about me?
That's so sweet.
Now, watch and learn.
Found them!
Tear gas?
Gray, those things been
sitting around for years.
You can't do this, Gray.
I've given these people sanctuary.
Reverend, this is a police matter now.
You have no right
to assault these people.
They've committed no crimes.
- They'll be my responsibility.
- What, are you going to feed them?
What, you got a little hospital
down there, Reverend?
No, I didn't think so.
What's that sound?
They're boarding up the windows.
There were half a dozen other places
we could have stopped,
but you kept talking like Jericho
was the end of the freakin' rainbow.
So we kept walking...
losing people... for this.
Out of my way, Johnston!
I know what I'm doing.
You know why we never used those?
A little thing called Waco happened.
The FBI used tear gas,
and they swear it didn't start
that fire, but it could have.
- You ready to live with that?
- Dad!
We can't hold off a town.
- It's too big a gamble.
- It's not a gamble for you!
You get to go home
to a warm bed every night.
I told you... I'm with you.
What happens when
we get kicked out of this town?
<i>Come on!
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!
<i>She's got no pulse.
Hank! Hank!
- Skylar!
- Thank God. There are men on the road!
- Men? What men?
- They're with Ravenwood.
Is your uncle here?
- No, it's just me.
- We have to hide!
Okay, yeah. Come on!
How many were there?
I don't know. Five, maybe six.
I can't see them.
You know what?
I bet you have
a better view from the hayloft.
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.
Skylar!
Stop!
It's okay. I'll wait.
One of the refugees is still out there.
You have the rangers search the barns.
Use dogs if it'll help.
And the rest of them?
Take them to the med center,
get them fixed up, Harry.
Then send them away.
What about the extra food
you promised them?
Give it to them.
- After what they did to us?
- Will you just do it,
before somebody else gets hurt?!
It's not too late.
Just let them stay until spring.
You think I haven't tried
to make that work?
The numbers don't add up.
- They're good people, Gray. Just...
- And?!
Good people are dying every day!
Someone finally has to tell the truth.
It's musical chairs out there.
The music has stopped!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, get away from me!
Get away from me!
A hundred counts of murder, Gray.
That's what they should charge you with
if you send them away.
We have been feeding them
and we have been heating the shelter.
We've been taking
from my friends
to give to strangers,
so don't you dare lecture me!
Whatever happens to them is on you!
Let me go, please!
- I don't want to hurt you!
- Just let me go, please!
You're not leaving
until this is resolved!
This is resolved!
Get out of my way!
- They're not going anywhere.
- You want to bet?
Just take whatever you want!
Just get out!
And go where?!
I got the entire police force
guarding the refugees,
and one way or another,
they're going.
Hey, stop it!
All right, stop it!
What's going on?
What happened?
Gray pulled a gun.
It was an accident.
Like hell! He shot me!
There's so much blood.
He needs a doctor.
- Get-get Kenchy.
- No, get Jessica.
Shut up!
You're not running things!
Get Jessica, please, all right?
I trust her.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
What are you looking for?
Superglue.
The sole on my boot came apart
after a couple hundred miles.
My son's shoes might fit you.
I'd rather fix these.
Why?
They're all I have left that are mine.
Where are you going to go?
I don't know really.
My family was in Chicago.
I wish there was more
that we could do.
Ma'am,
there are empty houses
all over Jericho,
and we sleep in a shelter.
Those are our neighbors' homes.
They were gone
when the bombs went off.
They're coming back.
Well, wherever your neighbors are,
I hope nobody's kicking them
out of town in the middle of winter.
What the hell happened in there?
- Gray's bleeding badly.
- I'm busy.
- I need your help!
- Get Kenchy.
Look, you're the only
one Roger trusts.
You want me to save
Gray Anderson?
If Gray dies, so does Roger.
People aren't just going
to let it go. Please?
We can all get out of this.
I was just trying to help them.
Now... there's no way the
town lets them stay.
It was an accident.
I saw it.
Gray...
just until spring.
That's all I ask.
Come on!
You were right.
This is on me.
I brought them here.
I did it...
I did it for my own reasons.
But don't punish them,
I'm begging you.
Just till spring.
Go to hell.
I've got Jessica. Let us in.
You need to let me look at him.
You give them a chance...
...I'll give you a chance.
I was going to give you
food, an escort.
We wouldn't survive out there...
you know that.
We have to stay here.
Why would you die over this?!
He's our only leverage.
Roger, this isn't you.
I survived out there
for three months.
You have no idea what
I can do if I have to.
- Any sign of her?
- No.
Check the buildings.
She's got to be around
here somewhere.
Hold up.
She changed the location again.
Meet you back at the road.
Bill, don't!
You think I want to?
Roger's a friend of mine, but I can't
let the mayor bleed to death.
What if you miss?
What if you hit Emily?
Get off me.
If I get the shot, Jake...
I'm taking it.
Damn it.
We have to get him help.
He didn't want to do this.
It doesn't matter what
we want, does it?
It matters what we do.
I tried to get us all back here.
I promised them if we
just stuck together.
- And you did.
- Yeah.
Emily, most of us made it back.
19 of us didn't.
What's going on?
And I remember...
every one of their faces.
- Get away from the window!
- Jake, what are you doing?!
- I told you to stay out!
- Get away from the window!
Get away from the window!
Roger, get away from
the window!
Roger, get away from
the window!
If you want your friends to live...
you better back the hell off
right now and listen to me!
Roger, he's here to help.
I'm listening.
What if we give you
transportation?
And food and fuel?
So we can die out there?
- Guy is that what you think about?
- No!
You can make it to
the migration trail.
Head south and beat the winter.
It's not your decision to make.
Won't be yours either if you're dead.
You can't keep us in here forever.
This will end.
And when it does,
you can forget about staying.
They will kick you out
with nothing.
I'm going to need guns.
I can't give you guns.
I can't protect a hundred
people with what I have.
But you let Jessica take Gray
to the medical center.
He's not leaving.
Roger, if that bullet is still in him,
I'm going to have to open him up.
Is it a deal?
You make sure everything's ready.
I'll let him go.
Hey, Allie.
Dad, you can't be around here.
Mom will freak out.
I won't stay long.
Come on.
So...
I just wanted to know
how you were doing.
Settling in okay at
Jimmy's place?
- Yeah, he just never stops talking.
- No...
He doesn't.
ow's Sam?
You know, he gets scared.
And you?
I'm fine.
Look...
that thing you had
to do to Sarah...
I know how that can
change people.
Dad...
don't worry about me.
I'm not Sam, and
I'm not Mom.
So...
you're not going to live with
us anymore... are you ?
I don't think it's a good
idea right now.
Then don't worry.
I'll take care of them.
Come here.
You are not me.
Thank you for helping me.
Just try to keep still.
It's my job, you know.
I didn't want to do it.
I had to.
We all have our jobs to do,
whether we want to do them or not.
Just hang on.
The bus is here.
When do you think you'll come back?
After this...
he's never going to
let me come back.
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought them here.
There were other places...
camps...
towns we heard about.
But I had to see you.
A refugee broke into the house.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'll get the guys.
Listen to me.
We can't let this happen.
We're ready.
Get up.
Wait, you can't take him.
Once my friends and I...
are safely out of town...
I'll let him go.
He'll be dead by then.
You can't let them go out there.
A woman died on Main Street today.
I didn't even know her name.
Did you?
If you need a hostage,
take me.
Think of our neighbors who
haven't made it back yet.
That's who they are.
Now my family can feed two people.
Now my family can feed two people.
Who else here is willing
to share their rations?
They're coming out!
All right, move back!
Move back!
Come on, people, we can do this.
I know we can, please.
Thank you, Bob. Yeah.
Right. Good.
Who else?
Come on, who else? Please.
Please.
Everybody, get back!
Get back!
Keep your guns down.
Keep them down.
Move back!
Move back!
- Move back!
- My God.
Roger...
it's over.
They can stay.
We found them homes.
Just put the gun down, Roger.
You won.
Come on, put it down.
How's the mayor?
Jessica did a great job.
He's, um...
he's lost a lot of blood,
but he's stable.
We talked him into letting
the others stay.
But, um...
Not me.
Well...
I'd say I'd call you, but...
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Roger, I-I am, so...
I did this
so the people I love
can be safe here.
I'm not taking the person I love
the most out on those roads.
I can handle it.
I can't.
So... what do you think?
Well, it's no Saks Fifth Avenue,
but...
it's pretty great.
Thanks to all the deals we made,
we have a real trading post now.
Hi, Mr. Simmons.
Hank.
- What?!
You think this is a joke?
I could've shot you.
Talk to your uncle, Hank.
He's the one that broke the deal.
You're just a real big man,
aren't you?
Just give me my horse
and the gas, and I'll be on my way.
The horse is tied up in the alley,
but the gas is mine.
I'm through playing
games with you.
Hank, get the gas.
Meet my new employees.
This is, um,
Jim and Judy Moore's house.
They were visiting their grandchildren
just outside of Philadelphia.
Rations are on Tuesday.
We'll be by to share them with you.
Mrs. Green.
Thank you.
We got together
some canned food and water.
I wish I had more.
Nothing I say is going to...
is going to sound right, so...
Are you really sad to see me go?
It's not about that.
Here.
Take Cedar Run first, it's clear,
and then head to New Bern.
Heather, Stanley, my brother,
they can help you
once you're there.
I know my way around.

Previously on <i>Jericho
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team
sold us all out.
You’re smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.
Get the package.
In the last three months,
I remembered
all the reasons...
why I needed you in my life.
So have I.
I've also remembered
why it can never work.
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
<i>We have also received reports
<i>that the bombers gained
the trust of local officials
<i>which allowed the terrorists
access to secure locations.
I’ve heard that voice before.
- That's the guy that does the
farm report.  - It’s real news.
<i>In New York, the terrorists
who were apprehended,
<i>were all carrying nearly perfect
fake FBI badges.
<i>- You're drunk.
- Yes, I am, Darcy.
<i>Yes, I am.
<i>What ?
What is it, Rob ?
Is all that really
worth it for 6 kids ?
Six kids in a conference room
is not Harvard, but it's a start.
I meant for you.
I think it's time we start trying
to get things back to normal.
To be honest with you,
if I'm a kid...
going to school isn't exactly high
on my list of priorities these days.
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, can I... borrow you for a few
minutes, I need your help.
I'm going to get you
a bat signal or something.
What's wrong ?
You remember, last week on the
radio broadcast, they said that
terrorists used fake FBI badges
to move through security ?
I've seen one of those badges.
Where ?
I never went to Law school,
but I'm going to go ahead and guess.
- This is breaking and entering.
- It's called probable cause.
It's called paranoďd
abuse of authority.
Come on, let's go... before he
comes home and catches you...
prying up his floorboards.
The terrorists had FBI badges...
Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge.
You think that's just coďncidence ?
Maybe he's FBI !
Please, tell me you thought of that.
I did...
and I asked his family.
And they all say he's FBI.
But... when they said it they all
had this look on their face like...
there was something that
they weren't saying.
Sort of like the look I've got
on my face right now.
Look, I had a hunch,
and I was right.
Now, he's out on patrol...
he's not going to be back
for a while, so...
Come on !
Did you bust this lock open ?
You know, this is kinda
weird, but...
if he's FBI, isn't this what
his basement would look like ?
That's... that's what I said...
until I saw this.
- Does Gray know about this ?
- No.
I wanted to get a second opinion
before I told anyone.
What do you want to do ?
Don't.
Who are you ?

Hand it over.
Nice and slow.
Slide it over.
What the hell are
you doing here ?
Did you wipe out 23
American cities ?
- Get out of my house.
- Answer the question !
- Why would you even think that ?
- You've got a working generator...
and a food supply.
So like you knew the
attacks were coming.
- I'm gonna give you 10 seconds...
- Back up !
Jimmy knows I'm here.
If I don't call him off
when he gets back...
you're gonna have a lot more
people than me to deal with.
I'm an FBI agent, Jake.
That's what I heard.
Problem is the radio was reporting
the terrorists used
forged FBI badges to get
their bombs into position.
What is that room ?
How were you involved
in all of this ?
I need to know.
5 months ago, this was
a map of our country.
Now, it's an antique.
It's a picture of the way
things used to be.
Right now...
all we're sure of is this.
But this is where we
start to rebuild.
So how do we do it ?
How ?
We look to our history.
We study the people
that came before us.
- Are you going to take attendance ?
- No.
Where are you going ?
My mom's at home right now...
trying to grow beets out of our
bathtub so we can eat newt month.
This stuff...
isn't important.
I guess school's out
early today.
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.
I don't think I should be hanging
around at home right now.
So, I guess I'm stuck here.
<i>So it's come to this...
I want you to know this has nothing
to do with you personnally, I'm...
sure you're...
wonderfull.
But let's be honest here, you're
the one that lays the fewest eggs
and I distinctly told all of you
that this was going to happen.
I believe I made myself perfectly
clear in that regard.
All right.
The thing is...
If you knew me at all,
you would...
see how really funny this is,
because this is so not my thing.
No... this is Stanley's thing.
It's just... I'm awfully hungry.
And... I don't want to get into the
whole circle of life business, but...
I just cannot eat anymore sprouts.
OK ? Enough stalling...
Here we go...
Here's my concern...
I've heard stories about how you're
gonna react to this, and
if I see half of you running around,
well I just know I'm gonna freak out.
So if you could do your best
to minimize that part of it...
I'd just really appreciate it.
Sprouts it is.
You really out here
looking for deer?
Thought they were all gone.
What do you want Harry ?
Do you think you could come
into city hall today ?
Gray’s still out, and
it’d be nice to have...
somebody around who knows
what they're doing.
Not my job anymore, and get lost,
I'm trying to shoot some deer.
Just be for a day or two.
You're starting to look an
awful lot like a deer, Harry.
I've been in the FBI
for 15 years.
I worked law enforcement after college,
and then I joined the bureau.
Where did you go to school ?
Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ?
The FBI, what were
you working on ?
I was sent here to monitor
the phone calls
made in the area to a...
suspected terrorist cell.
- And what did you find out ?
- Nothing.
Trail went dead.
We about done here ?
Not even close.
Tell me about her...
Sarah Mason.
She's gone.
You're pretty thorough.
Also took care of the one
in the cabinet
and the one behind
the water heater.
There's only one loaded
gun in this house...
and it's mine.
Sit down.
Arms behind you.
Tell me about Sarah.
Jimmy said she was also
a cop in St Louis.
She's working with you ?
Against you ?
Who are these people ?
You are making a serious mistake.
- I am a Federal Officer.
- Really ?
Really sure you're not.
Robert Willer...
State Department.
How about Robert Snyder...
Colombus PD ?
Commander Robert Richmond...
Naval Intelligence.
None of those are real...
and neither is that badge.
Who the hell are you ?
Who do you you work for ?
You do not wanna know
what I know.
- I think I can handle it.
- Really ?
Cause I can barely handle it,
and I was trained for this.
You want to tell me...
or you tell the whole town.
All right.
But once you hear this...
You are a part of it, Jake,
and there is no going back.
Who do you work for ?
CIA.
Sarah Mason and I were part of
an off-the-books team.
We were tracking the bombs
used in the attack.
Where did they come from...
the bombs ?
The US government
brought them in.
See, after the Soviet Union fell...
neglected military in the
satellite republics started
selling their nuclear stockpiles
on the black market.
So the CIA started
an operation...
get that material by any
and all means necessary.
But a few years ago, a shipment
disappeared on its way
to the DOE storage complex
in Oak Ridge.
And that is where my
CIA team came in.
Why you ?
I'm the best at what I do.
And what is that ?
Satellite installation.
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
with Mr. Higgins.
I've been inside all day.
How's the weather out there ?
You know, it looks like rain.
Thank you.
- Hello Victor.
- Hawkins.
I believe you know
everyone here...
except this young lady.
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.
All right, let's get down to it.
We have a lot of
ground to cover.
As most of you know...
a shipment of nukes from
project Red Bell is missing.
What you don't know...
is that we have quality intel
that those warheads...
have been converted
into 25 small...
high yield devices.
These bombs have been
dissiminated to extremists cells
active within the United States.
So, is this Al Qaeda ?
I wish it were that simple.
It's much larger than that.
It's a cross section of
domestic militias...
anarchists,
and religious fanatics.
As you can see,
these are terrorists...
that would never collaborate,
ideologically or politically.
The only thing that links
them, is the desire
to take down the
federal government.
Our job, is to get undercover
in these cells...
and find these bombs.
So who do we think
is orchestrating this ?
The agency's been at this
from every angle...
and all we know is that
he's got deep ressources,
an ability to coordinate
diverse groups,
and by all indications...
he's an American.
We were broken up
into groups of two.
Each unit was...
assigned a terrorist cell.
One agent went undercover,
one acted as a handler.
You can't expect me to believe
you were sent here...
undercover.
What's so special
about this place ?
You know, I would
show you, but...
That's clever.
It's over there...
behind the map.
Where did you get this ?
Those are defense department projections
they've been doing since the 50s.
The fallout scenarios in the event of
a nuclear attack on 20 US cities.
And you see Jericho ?
It's outside the fallout zones, Jake.
It's got a salt mine,
plenty of farm land,
and access to an untainted
water table.
So you weren't here to
monitor phone calls ?
Jericho was a rally-point in case
we failed in our mission.
Failed ?
Or succeeded ?
And Johnston, was...
He wanted to come,
I know he did.
He's just having a hard time
dealing with things lately.
He always gets quiet...
when he's going through
something, but...
just wish I could think
of something
to help him get through this.
We miss you, sweetheart.
There's no more sprouts.
You finished them ?
I was hungry.
What are you doing here, Sean.
It's like 9:30 in the morning...
Oh, my...
You slept here ?
Well, actually... there was not a
lot of sleeping going on.
Get out of the house !
What are you doing ?
- You let him spend a night ?
- Yes.
Well that doesn't seem like something
Stanley would approve of, does it ?
Stanley's not here.
Just like that. You infiltrated a
terror cell planning a nuclear attack ?
Yeah...
just like that.
It took me 2 years.
8 months of it in prison...
developing contacts,
getting into the network.
The only outside person I
communicated with was my handler.
After prison,
I spent another year
trying to gain their trust
on the outside.
And even then, I was only
scratching the surface.
But you got in.
How ?
They were looking for
high grade government IDs.
You gave them their badges !
I had to proove that I was loyal
and valuable to the cell, Jake.
- I think I've heard enough.
- No !
You barely scratched
the surface.
You're the one who
wanted to hear this,
so why don't you hear it all ?
The cell was looking for IDs.
And I needed to get higher up
in their organisation.
So I let it be known
that I had a source.
See, the badges...
were going to be tagged so that
my team could track them.
They sent me to make the buy
with another cell member.
It was a kid named Daryl.
How do we know
these are real ?
They're real enough.
Where did you get them from ?
How and where I got these
badges... is my business.
What you do with them...
is yours.
- Nice doing business with you.
- You too.
We should celebrate, man.
Go out, get some girls.
Except you don't really seem
like the type. All serious.
Are you married ?
I was.
Really ?
What happened ?
What the hell is going on ?
Hold it right there !
I'm sorry man.
You gotta be kidding me.
FBI !
Hands in the air !
Back against the car.
<i>It turns out Daryl was
an FBI informant.
But my handler got me out,
and we kept my cover intact.
So the FBI have an informant
in my target cell.
And they can't tell us
anything about that ?
You know, I'm damn lucky
that my cover wasn't blown.
- Your cover's intact, yes ?
- Yeah, we believe so.
Then let's move on.
Have you been able to make contact
with those coordinating the attack ?
No... but at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells
that we've already inflitrated.
You know, at the very least that
would disrupt the overall plan...
maybe delay it for...
- How many of the bombs can you get ?
A third, for sure...
half if we're lucky.
Look... I know...
it's not ideal, but at this stage,
it is the safest move.
That's still a dozen
bombs in play.
- What are you doing ?
- I just think there's a way to...
speed this up and get
all the bombs at once.
- Yeah, and we agreed that...
- Do you mind ?
I think there may be a way
to get us further inside.
My partner tells the cell leader
that Daryl is the FBI informant.
That gives him the credibility
that he needs to move up faster.
Then let us handle the FBI...
and do whatever is necessary
to save the operation.
- It's all gonna take some time,
but we're close  - OK.
We're counting on you,
and you know the risks.
You'd better be right about this.
This is the right way to go.
Trust me.
What would you have done ?
Stayed in,
or pulled the plug ?
It seems like the wrong
question to me.
I'd ask myself how much
I trusted my partner.
Well, if I can sneak up here without
you so much as turning around...
how are you gonna
hear any game ?
I heard you half a mile
back in those shoes.
You said you'd come with me
to see April today.
Fine.
You coming home for dinner ?
There are no deer in these woods,
they've all been picked clean.
Then, I guess I'll
be here a while.
I never wanted to be a mom'.
I didn't sign up for this.
You know what, you're right.
I owe it to Stanley.
So I'm just gonna have
to jump in...
with both feet, whether she wants
to hear from me or not.
Listen to me going on
about my own problems.
You must be ady to take this hatchet
and do the damn job yourself.
I didn't know that he
knew how to sign.
What did he say to you ?
Never mind, look...
That boy's bad news.
Now, I can't stop you
from seeing him...
but he is no longer welcome in this
house, do you understand me ?
Allison...
so why do you feel like you
can't hang out at home ?
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.
It's not that I don't wanna
talk about it.
It's just...
my family's pretty weird.
My family was pretty weird too.
In fact, when I was your age, I didn't
want to hang out with them either.
What about now ?
They're gone.
There's this thing that went
down at my house...
a couple weeks ago.
I did something.
OK. What did you do ?
I did something that...
can't be forgiven.
Now my mom just keeps...
looking at me.
Like I've changed into some kind
of monster, or something.
You know you haven't, right ?
So... even though you
weren't sure about the plan,
you outed the informant
to the cell leader.
Once we decided to leave
the bombs in play,
it was the only way for me to
get deep enough into the cell
and gain their trust.
I told the cell leader that
Daryl was the informant,
but I wanted to get him out of there
before they killed him.
Come on, grab what you
need and let's go.
They're gonna hunt me down,
and they're gonna kill me.
It's your lucky day, Daryl.
They're gonna get you into witness
protection, so don't worry.
We're gonna get
you out of here.
Stay there.
- Damn it !
- What is it ?
<i>Daryl, we just wanna talk.
The cell leader.
You gotta get me
out of this place.
Run !
I'll tell them that
you got away.
I think my leg is broken.
Please, help me !
Or I'm gonna tell them
who you really are.
I'm sorry.
<i>So, I finally gain their trust.
<i>I was in.
You killed him.
It was either killed him...
or possibly let millions
of people die.
They died anyway.
<i>Jake ?
<i>You're still down there ?
Call him off.
You're not helping your cause by
keeping that gun in my face.
<i>Hey, Jake ?
Do not make me kill him Jake.
All right.
- All right !
<i>- Jake ?
What's going on, Jake ?
We need a little more
time, that's all.
- You're sure ?
- Yeah, we're all right.
- I... I'm out front.
- OK.
Turn around, Jake.
It is not about this anymore.
We're past this.
Starting now,
we trust each other.
You need to tell me everything.
Done telling.
Now, I gotta show you.
What are you doing here ?
It's your first day
at a new school.
You know, the last time you had one
of those, Sam was in diapers.
Doesn'’t look like you
had a big turnout.
No, most people left early.
I guess you knew better.
I figured you didn't really want
me around the house anyway.
Why would you say that ?
You know...
because of what I did.
Allison, I love you.
OK ? Nothing will
change that.
Hear me baby ?
Nothing will change that.
My little girl.
Mom, please
don't be mad at me.
I'm so sorry, mom'.
- Here's the part I don't get.
- What ?
If you're telling the truth...
you made it.
You made it deep inside the cell,
you gained their trust.
Right.
Then, what happened ?
Somebody tipped off the
terrorists, Jake.
Before we could find out who...
<i>the terrorists moved up
their plan.
Victor ?
We made a mistake,
<i>a very big mistake.</i>
This is the moment we prepared for.
Strike will go off tomorrow,
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.
OK. No... listen !
The trucks...
they're white.
License plate
Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...
<i>I tried to warn the agency...
<i>but we were too late.
Some of the bombs were meant
for New York.
We managed to head them off.
Even after 4 years of work...
I couldn't stop all of them.
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.
Since when have
you been funny ?
I have always been funny.
Yeah, not for a long time.
What is it Rob ?
- Rob ?
- I won't be long.
Not interrupting, am I ?
You know you are.
You're not exactly
returning our calls.
I told my wife I was done.
I promised her, Victor.
- We need you back.
- Why me ?
Because you're the best
at what you do.
Which is what ?
Your family will be there,
when you get back.
Team is meeting tomorrow.
Come listen to what this
is all about.
If you wanna walk
away after that...
you walk away.
2 o'clock...
tomorrow.
Tell the desk jockey you have an
appointment with Mr. Higgins.
If they ask about the weather...
tell hem it's gonna rain.
Who was that ?
I might need to go
to a meeting tomorow.
I can't keep doing this,
I can't.
We'll be fine, D.
What is that ?
It's the end of the
rabbit hole, Jake.
Gimme a hand with this.
So you believe me now ?
Is that what I think it is ?
It was meant for Columbus, Ohio.
You brought a nuclear bomb...
here.
What would you have
done with it ?
What do you gonna do with it ?
I'm gonna keep it safe.
I'm gonna keep it secret,
you know. Because...
it gives the town some power, Jake,
but it also makes them a target.
Look...
I know what you're thinking...
You're wishing you'd walked away
when I gave you the chance, right ?
Why didn’t you show me thing
when I walked in the door today.
You didn't walk in.
<i>Jake ?
<i>Hey, Jake ?
I've been watching you, Jake...
and you can handle yourself.
And I've seen what a help
you have been to this stown.
But I needed to know
that I can trust you.
That you could handle it
if I told you everything.
<i>Jake ?
This bomb...
it's our burden, now.
Whatever happens next...
that is gonna be
up to you. OK ?
He's FBI.
Just like he said.
But...
We're in good hands.
That's good to hear.
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Hawkins.
We do that, outside.
I didn't know that.
There’s something
I want to say to you.
I'm still learning...
so just, please bear with me.
Stanley...
is...
important...
to me.
You... are...
important... to me.
I... want... you...
to be safe.
So please... be patient...
with me.
I'm trying...
I'll try too.
So...
hug ?
Right.
I brought you some dinner.
Thank you.
<i>You know what, I am damn lucky
that my cover wasn’t blown.
<i>- Your cover's intact ?
- Yeah, we believe so.
<i>Then let's move on.
<i>But at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

infiltrated...

can you get ?

Previously on <i>Jericho
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team
sold us all out.
You’re smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.
Get the package.
In the last three months,
I remembered
all the reasons...
why I needed you in my life.
So have I.
I've also remembered
why it can never work.
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
<i>We have also received reports
<i>that the bombers gained
the trust of local officials
<i>which allowed the terrorists
access to secure locations.
I’ve heard that voice before.
- That's the guy that does the
farm report.  - It’s real news.
<i>In New York, the terrorists
who were apprehended,
<i>were all carrying nearly perfect
fake FBI badges.
<i>- You're drunk.
- Yes, I am, Darcy.
<i>Yes, I am.
<i>What ?
What is it, Rob ?
Is all that really
worth it for 6 kids ?
Six kids in a conference room
is not Harvard, but it's a start.
I meant for you.
I think it's time we start trying
to get things back to normal.
To be honest with you,
if I'm a kid...
going to school isn't exactly high
on my list of priorities these days.
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, can I... borrow you for a few
minutes, I need your help.
I'm going to get you
a bat signal or something.
What's wrong ?
You remember, last week on the
radio broadcast, they said that
terrorists used fake FBI badges
to move through security ?
I've seen one of those badges.
Where ?
I never went to Law school,
but I'm going to go ahead and guess.
- This is breaking and entering.
- It's called probable cause.
It's called paranoďd
abuse of authority.
Come on, let's go... before he
comes home and catches you...
prying up his floorboards.
The terrorists had FBI badges...
Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge.
You think that's just coďncidence ?
Maybe he's FBI !
Please, tell me you thought of that.
I did...
and I asked his family.
And they all say he's FBI.
But... when they said it they all
had this look on their face like...
there was something that
they weren't saying.
Sort of like the look I've got
on my face right now.
Look, I had a hunch,
and I was right.
Now, he's out on patrol...
he's not going to be back
for a while, so...
Come on !
Did you bust this lock open ?
You know, this is kinda
weird, but...
if he's FBI, isn't this what
his basement would look like ?
That's... that's what I said...
until I saw this.
- Does Gray know about this ?
- No.
I wanted to get a second opinion
before I told anyone.
What do you want to do ?
Don't.
Who are you ?

Hand it over.
Nice and slow.
Slide it over.
What the hell are
you doing here ?
Did you wipe out 23
American cities ?
- Get out of my house.
- Answer the question !
- Why would you even think that ?
- You've got a working generator...
and a food supply.
So like you knew the
attacks were coming.
- I'm gonna give you 10 seconds...
- Back up !
Jimmy knows I'm here.
If I don't call him off
when he gets back...
you're gonna have a lot more
people than me to deal with.
I'm an FBI agent, Jake.
That's what I heard.
Problem is the radio was reporting
the terrorists used
forged FBI badges to get
their bombs into position.
What is that room ?
How were you involved
in all of this ?
I need to know.
5 months ago, this was
a map of our country.
Now, it's an antique.
It's a picture of the way
things used to be.
Right now...
all we're sure of is this.
But this is where we
start to rebuild.
So how do we do it ?
How ?
We look to our history.
We study the people
that came before us.
- Are you going to take attendance ?
- No.
Where are you going ?
My mom's at home right now...
trying to grow beets out of our
bathtub so we can eat newt month.
This stuff...
isn't important.
I guess school's out
early today.
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.
I don't think I should be hanging
around at home right now.
So, I guess I'm stuck here.
<i>So it's come to this...
I want you to know this has nothing
to do with you personnally, I'm...
sure you're...
wonderfull.
But let's be honest here, you're
the one that lays the fewest eggs
and I distinctly told all of you
that this was going to happen.
I believe I made myself perfectly
clear in that regard.
All right.
The thing is...
If you knew me at all,
you would...
see how really funny this is,
because this is so not my thing.
No... this is Stanley's thing.
It's just... I'm awfully hungry.
And... I don't want to get into the
whole circle of life business, but...
I just cannot eat anymore sprouts.
OK ? Enough stalling...
Here we go...
Here's my concern...
I've heard stories about how you're
gonna react to this, and
if I see half of you running around,
well I just know I'm gonna freak out.
So if you could do your best
to minimize that part of it...
I'd just really appreciate it.
Sprouts it is.
You really out here
looking for deer?
Thought they were all gone.
What do you want Harry ?
Do you think you could come
into city hall today ?
Gray’s still out, and
it’d be nice to have...
somebody around who knows
what they're doing.
Not my job anymore, and get lost,
I'm trying to shoot some deer.
Just be for a day or two.
You're starting to look an
awful lot like a deer, Harry.
I've been in the FBI
for 15 years.
I worked law enforcement after college,
and then I joined the bureau.
Where did you go to school ?
Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ?
The FBI, what were
you working on ?
I was sent here to monitor
the phone calls
made in the area to a...
suspected terrorist cell.
- And what did you find out ?
- Nothing.
Trail went dead.
We about done here ?
Not even close.
Tell me about her...
Sarah Mason.
She's gone.
You're pretty thorough.
Also took care of the one
in the cabinet
and the one behind
the water heater.
There's only one loaded
gun in this house...
and it's mine.
Sit down.
Arms behind you.
Tell me about Sarah.
Jimmy said she was also
a cop in St Louis.
She's working with you ?
Against you ?
Who are these people ?
You are making a serious mistake.
- I am a Federal Officer.
- Really ?
Really sure you're not.
Robert Willer...
State Department.
How about Robert Snyder...
Colombus PD ?
Commander Robert Richmond...
Naval Intelligence.
None of those are real...
and neither is that badge.
Who the hell are you ?
Who do you you work for ?
You do not wanna know
what I know.
- I think I can handle it.
- Really ?
Cause I can barely handle it,
and I was trained for this.
You want to tell me...
or you tell the whole town.
All right.
But once you hear this...
You are a part of it, Jake,
and there is no going back.
Who do you work for ?
CIA.
Sarah Mason and I were part of
an off-the-books team.
We were tracking the bombs
used in the attack.
Where did they come from...
the bombs ?
The US government
brought them in.
See, after the Soviet Union fell...
neglected military in the
satellite republics started
selling their nuclear stockpiles
on the black market.
So the CIA started
an operation...
get that material by any
and all means necessary.
But a few years ago, a shipment
disappeared on its way
to the DOE storage complex
in Oak Ridge.
And that is where my
CIA team came in.
Why you ?
I'm the best at what I do.
And what is that ?
Satellite installation.
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
with Mr. Higgins.
I've been inside all day.
How's the weather out there ?
You know, it looks like rain.
Thank you.
- Hello Victor.
- Hawkins.
I believe you know
everyone here...
except this young lady.
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.
All right, let's get down to it.
We have a lot of
ground to cover.
As most of you know...
a shipment of nukes from
project Red Bell is missing.
What you don't know...
is that we have quality intel
that those warheads...
have been converted
into 25 small...
high yield devices.
These bombs have been
dissiminated to extremists cells
active within the United States.
So, is this Al Qaeda ?
I wish it were that simple.
It's much larger than that.
It's a cross section of
domestic militias...
anarchists,
and religious fanatics.
As you can see,
these are terrorists...
that would never collaborate,
ideologically or politically.
The only thing that links
them, is the desire
to take down the
federal government.
Our job, is to get undercover
in these cells...
and find these bombs.
So who do we think
is orchestrating this ?
The agency's been at this
from every angle...
and all we know is that
he's got deep ressources,
an ability to coordinate
diverse groups,
and by all indications...
he's an American.
We were broken up
into groups of two.
Each unit was...
assigned a terrorist cell.
One agent went undercover,
one acted as a handler.
You can't expect me to believe
you were sent here...
undercover.
What's so special
about this place ?
You know, I would
show you, but...
That's clever.
It's over there...
behind the map.
Where did you get this ?
Those are defense department projections
they've been doing since the 50s.
The fallout scenarios in the event of
a nuclear attack on 20 US cities.
And you see Jericho ?
It's outside the fallout zones, Jake.
It's got a salt mine,
plenty of farm land,
and access to an untainted
water table.
So you weren't here to
monitor phone calls ?
Jericho was a rally-point in case
we failed in our mission.
Failed ?
Or succeeded ?
And Johnston, was...
He wanted to come,
I know he did.
He's just having a hard time
dealing with things lately.
He always gets quiet...
when he's going through
something, but...
just wish I could think
of something
to help him get through this.
We miss you, sweetheart.
There's no more sprouts.
You finished them ?
I was hungry.
What are you doing here, Sean.
It's like 9:30 in the morning...
Oh, my...
You slept here ?
Well, actually... there was not a
lot of sleeping going on.
Get out of the house !
What are you doing ?
- You let him spend a night ?
- Yes.
Well that doesn't seem like something
Stanley would approve of, does it ?
Stanley's not here.
Just like that. You infiltrated a
terror cell planning a nuclear attack ?
Yeah...
just like that.

How and where I got these

What you do with them...
is yours.
- Nice doing business with you.
- You too.
We should celebrate, man.
Go out, get some girls.
Except you don't really seem
like the type. All serious.
Are you married ?
I was.
Really ?
What happened ?
What the hell is going on ?

You gotta be kidding me.

<i>It turns out Daryl was

A third, for sure...
half if we're lucky.
Look... I know...
it's not ideal, but at this stage,
it is the safest move.
That's still a dozen
bombs in play.
- What are you doing ?
- I just think there's a way to...
speed this up and get
all the bombs at once.
- Yeah, and we agreed that...
- Do you mind ?
I think there may be a way
to get us further inside.
My partner tells the cell leader
that Daryl is the FBI informant.
That gives him the credibility
that he needs to move up faster.
Then let us handle the FBI...
and do whatever is necessary
to save the operation.
- It's all gonna take some time,
but we're close  - OK.
We're counting on you,
and you know the risks.
You'd better be right about this.
This is the right way to go.
Trust me.
What would you have done ?
Stayed in,
or pulled the plug ?
It seems like the wrong
question to me.
I'd ask myself how much
I trusted my partner.
Well, if I can sneak up here without
you so much as turning around...
how are you gonna
hear any game ?
I heard you half a mile
back in those shoes.
You said you'd come with me
to see April today.
Fine.
You coming home for dinner ?
There are no deer in these woods,
they've all been picked clean.
Then, I guess I'll
be here a while.
I never wanted to be a mom'.
I didn't sign up for this.
You know what, you're right.
I owe it to Stanley.
So I'm just gonna have
to jump in...
with both feet, whether she wants
to hear from me or not.
Listen to me going on
about my own problems.
You must be ady to take this hatchet
and do the damn job yourself.
I didn't know that he
knew how to sign.
What did he say to you ?
Never mind, look...
That boy's bad news.
Now, I can't stop you
from seeing him...
but he is no longer welcome in this
house, do you understand me ?
Allison...
so why do you feel like you
can't hang out at home ?
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.
It's not that I don't wanna
talk about it.
It's just...
my family's pretty weird.
My family was pretty weird too.
In fact, when I was your age, I didn't
want to hang out with them either.
What about now ?
They're gone.
There's this thing that went
down at my house...
a couple weeks ago.
I did something.
OK. What did you do ?
I did something that...
can't be forgiven.
Now my mom just keeps...
looking at me.
Like I've changed into some kind
of monster, or something.
You know you haven't, right ?
So... even though you
weren't sure about the plan,
you outed the informant
to the cell leader.
Once we decided to leave
the bombs in play,
it was the only way for me to
get deep enough into the cell
and gain their trust.
I told the cell leader that
Daryl was the informant,
but I wanted to get him out of there
before they killed him.
Come on, grab what you
need and let's go.
They're gonna hunt me down,
and they're gonna kill me.
It's your lucky day, Daryl.
They're gonna get you into witness
protection, so don't worry.
We're gonna get
you out of here.
Stay there.
- Damn it !
- What is it ?
<i>Daryl, we just wanna talk.
The cell leader.
You gotta get me
out of this place.
Run !
I'll tell them that
you got away.
I think my leg is broken.
Please, help me !
Or I'm gonna tell them
who you really are.
I'm sorry.
<i>So, I finally gain their trust.
<i>I was in.
You killed him.
It was either killed him...
or possibly let millions
of people die.
They died anyway.
<i>Jake ?
<i>You're still down there ?
Call him off.
You're not helping your cause by
keeping that gun in my face.
<i>Hey, Jake ?
Do not make me kill him Jake.
All right.
- All right !
<i>- Jake ?
What's going on, Jake ?
We need a little more
time, that's all.
- You're sure ?
- Yeah, we're all right.
- I... I'm out front.
- OK.
Turn around, Jake.
It is not about this anymore.
We're past this.
Starting now,
we trust each other.
You need to tell me everything.
Done telling.
Now, I gotta show you.
What are you doing here ?
It's your first day
at a new school.
You know, the last time you had one
of those, Sam was in diapers.
Doesn'’t look like you
had a big turnout.
No, most people left early.
I guess you knew better.
I figured you didn't really want
me around the house anyway.
Why would you say that ?
You know...
because of what I did.
Allison, I love you.
OK ? Nothing will
change that.
Hear me baby ?
Nothing will change that.
My little girl.
Mom, please
don't be mad at me.
I'm so sorry, mom'.
- Here's the part I don't get.
- What ?
If you're telling the truth...
you made it.
You made it deep inside the cell,
you gained their trust.
Right.
Then, what happened ?
Somebody tipped off the
terrorists, Jake.
Before we could find out who...
<i>the terrorists moved up
their plan.
Victor ?
We made a mistake,
<i>a very big mistake.</i>
This is the moment we prepared for.
Strike will go off tomorrow,
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.
OK. No... listen !
The trucks...
they're white.
License plate
Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...
<i>I tried to warn the agency...
<i>but we were too late.
Some of the bombs were meant
for New York.
We managed to head them off.
Even after 4 years of work...
I couldn't stop all of them.
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.
Since when have
you been funny ?
I have always been funny.
Yeah, not for a long time.
What is it Rob ?
- Rob ?
- I won't be long.
Not interrupting, am I ?
You know you are.
You're not exactly
returning our calls.
I told my wife I was done.
I promised her, Victor.
- We need you back.
- Why me ?
Because you're the best
at what you do.
Which is what ?
Your family will be there,
when you get back.
Team is meeting tomorrow.
Come listen to what this
is all about.
If you wanna walk
away after that...
you walk away.
2 o'clock...
tomorrow.
Tell the desk jockey you have an
appointment with Mr. Higgins.
If they ask about the weather...
tell hem it's gonna rain.
Who was that ?
I might need to go
to a meeting tomorow.
I can't keep doing this,
I can't.
We'll be fine, D.
What is that ?
It's the end of the
rabbit hole, Jake.
Gimme a hand with this.
So you believe me now ?
Is that what I think it is ?
It was meant for Columbus, Ohio.
You brought a nuclear bomb...
here.
What would you have
done with it ?
What do you gonna do with it ?
I'm gonna keep it safe.
I'm gonna keep it secret,
you know. Because...
it gives the town some power, Jake,
but it also makes them a target.
Look...
I know what you're thinking...
You're wishing you'd walked away
when I gave you the chance, right ?
Why didn’t you show me thing
when I walked in the door today.
You didn't walk in.
<i>Jake ?
<i>Hey, Jake ?
I've been watching you, Jake...
and you can handle yourself.
And I've seen what a help
you have been to this stown.
But I needed to know
that I can trust you.
That you could handle it
if I told you everything.
<i>Jake ?
This bomb...
it's our burden, now.
Whatever happens next...
that is gonna be
up to you. OK ?
He's FBI.
Just like he said.
But...
We're in good hands.
That's good to hear.
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Hawkins.
We do that, outside.
I didn't know that.
There’s something
I want to say to you.
I'm still learning...
so just, please bear with me.
Stanley...
is...
important...
to me.
You... are...
important... to me.
I... want... you...
to be safe.
So please... be patient...
with me.
I'm trying...
I'll try too.
So...
hug ?
Right.
I brought you some dinner.
Thank you.
<i>You know what, I am damn lucky
that my cover wasn’t blown.
<i>- Your cover's intact ?
- Yeah, we believe so.
<i>Then let's move on.
<i>But at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells
<i>that we've already
infiltrated...
<i>How many of the bombs
can you get ?
How many of the bombs
can you get ?

Previously on <i>Jericho
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team
sold us all out.
You’re smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.
Get the package.
In the last three months,
I remembered
all the reasons...
why I needed you in my life.
So have I.
I've also remembered
why it can never work.
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
<i>We have also received reports
<i>that the bombers gained
the trust of local officials
<i>which allowed the terrorists
access to secure locations.
I’ve heard that voice before.
- That's the guy that does the
farm report.  - It’s real news.
<i>In New York, the terrorists
who were apprehended,
<i>were all carrying nearly perfect
fake FBI badges.
<i>- You're drunk.
- Yes, I am, Darcy.
<i>Yes, I am.
<i>What ?
What is it, Rob ?
Is all that really
worth it for 6 kids ?
Six kids in a conference room
is not Harvard, but it's a start.
I meant for you.
I think it's time we start trying
to get things back to normal.
To be honest with you,
if I'm a kid...
going to school isn't exactly high
on my list of priorities these days.
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, can I... borrow you for a few
minutes, I need your help.
I'm going to get you
a bat signal or something.
What's wrong ?
You remember, last week on the
radio broadcast, they said that
terrorists used fake FBI badges
to move through security ?
I've seen one of those badges.
Where ?
I never went to Law school,
but I'm going to go ahead and guess.
- This is breaking and entering.
- It's called probable cause.
It's called paranoďd
abuse of authority.
Come on, let's go... before he
comes home and catches you...
prying up his floorboards.
The terrorists had FBI badges...
Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge.
You think that's just coďncidence ?
Maybe he's FBI !
Please, tell me you thought of that.
I did...
and I asked his family.
And they all say he's FBI.
But... when they said it they all
had this look on their face like...
there was something that
they weren't saying.
Sort of like the look I've got
on my face right now.
Look, I had a hunch,
and I was right.
Now, he's out on patrol...
he's not going to be back
for a while, so...
Come on !
Did you bust this lock open ?
You know, this is kinda
weird, but...
if he's FBI, isn't this what
his basement would look like ?
That's... that's what I said...
until I saw this.
- Does Gray know about this ?
- No.
I wanted to get a second opinion
before I told anyone.
What do you want to do ?
Don't.
Who are you ?

Hand it over.
Nice and slow.
Slide it over.
What the hell are
you doing here ?
Did you wipe out 23
American cities ?
- Get out of my house.
- Answer the question !
- Why would you even think that ?
- You've got a working generator...
and a food supply.
So like you knew the
attacks were coming.
- I'm gonna give you 10 seconds...
- Back up !
Jimmy knows I'm here.
If I don't call him off
when he gets back...
you're gonna have a lot more
people than me to deal with.
I'm an FBI agent, Jake.
That's what I heard.
Problem is the radio was reporting
the terrorists used
forged FBI badges to get
their bombs into position.
What is that room ?
How were you involved
in all of this ?
I need to know.
5 months ago, this was
a map of our country.
Now, it's an antique.
It's a picture of the way
things used to be.
Right now...
all we're sure of is this.
But this is where we
start to rebuild.
So how do we do it ?
How ?
We look to our history.
We study the people
that came before us.
- Are you going to take attendance ?
- No.
Where are you going ?
My mom's at home right now...
trying to grow beets out of our
bathtub so we can eat newt month.
This stuff...
isn't important.
I guess school's out
early today.
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.
I don't think I should be hanging
around at home right now.
So, I guess I'm stuck here.
<i>So it's come to this...
I want you to know this has nothing
to do with you personnally, I'm...
sure you're...
wonderfull.
But let's be honest here, you're
the one that lays the fewest eggs
and I distinctly told all of you
that this was going to happen.
I believe I made myself perfectly
clear in that regard.
All right.
The thing is...
If you knew me at all,
you would...
see how really funny this is,
because this is so not my thing.
No... this is Stanley's thing.
It's just... I'm awfully hungry.
And... I don't want to get into the
whole circle of life business, but...
I just cannot eat anymore sprouts.
OK ? Enough stalling...
Here we go...
Here's my concern...
I've heard stories about how you're
gonna react to this, and
if I see half of you running around,
well I just know I'm gonna freak out.
So if you could do your best
to minimize that part of it...
I'd just really appreciate it.
Sprouts it is.
You really out here
looking for deer?
Thought they were all gone.
What do you want Harry ?
Do you think you could come
into city hall today ?
Gray’s still out, and
it’d be nice to have...
somebody around who knows
what they're doing.
Not my job anymore, and get lost,
I'm trying to shoot some deer.
Just be for a day or two.
You're starting to look an
awful lot like a deer, Harry.
I've been in the FBI
for 15 years.
I worked law enforcement after college,
and then I joined the bureau.
Where did you go to school ?
Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ?
The FBI, what were
you working on ?
I was sent here to monitor
the phone calls
made in the area to a...
suspected terrorist cell.
- And what did you find out ?
- Nothing.
Trail went dead.
We about done here ?
Not even close.
Tell me about her...
Sarah Mason.
She's gone.
You're pretty thorough.
Also took care of the one
in the cabinet
and the one behind
the water heater.
There's only one loaded
gun in this house...
and it's mine.
Sit down.
Arms behind you.
Tell me about Sarah.
Jimmy said she was also
a cop in St Louis.
She's working with you ?
Against you ?
Who are these people ?
You are making a serious mistake.
- I am a Federal Officer.
- Really ?
Really sure you're not.
Robert Willer...
State Department.
How about Robert Snyder...
Colombus PD ?
Commander Robert Richmond...
Naval Intelligence.
None of those are real...
and neither is that badge.
Who the hell are you ?
Who do you you work for ?
You do not wanna know
what I know.
- I think I can handle it.
- Really ?
Cause I can barely handle it,
and I was trained for this.
You want to tell me...
or you tell the whole town.
All right.
But once you hear this...
You are a part of it, Jake,
and there is no going back.
Who do you work for ?
CIA.
Sarah Mason and I were part of
an off-the-books team.
We were tracking the bombs
used in the attack.
Where did they come from...
the bombs ?
The US government
brought them in.
See, after the Soviet Union fell...
neglected military in the
satellite republics started
selling their nuclear stockpiles
on the black market.
So the CIA started
an operation...
get that material by any
and all means necessary.
But a few years ago, a shipment
disappeared on its way
to the DOE storage complex
in Oak Ridge.
And that is where my
CIA team came in.
Why you ?
I'm the best at what I do.
And what is that ?
Satellite installation.
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
with Mr. Higgins.
I've been inside all day.
How's the weather out there ?
You know, it looks like rain.
Thank you.
- Hello Victor.
- Hawkins.
I believe you know
everyone here...
except this young lady.
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.
All right, let's get down to it.
We have a lot of
ground to cover.
As most of you know...
a shipment of nukes from
project Red Bell is missing.
What you don't know...
is that we have quality intel
that those warheads...
have been converted
into 25 small...
high yield devices.
These bombs have been
dissiminated to extremists cells
active within the United States.
So, is this Al Qaeda ?
I wish it were that simple.
It's much larger than that.
It's a cross section of
domestic militias...
anarchists,
and religious fanatics.
As you can see,
these are terrorists...
that would never collaborate,
ideologically or politically.
The only thing that links
them, is the desire
to take down the
federal government.
Our job, is to get undercover
in these cells...
and find these bombs.
So who do we think
is orchestrating this ?
The agency's been at this
from every angle...
and all we know is that
he's got deep ressources,
an ability to coordinate
diverse groups,
and by all indications...
he's an American.
We were broken up
into groups of two.
Each unit was...
assigned a terrorist cell.
One agent went undercover,
one acted as a handler.
You can't expect me to believe
you were sent here...
undercover.
What's so special
about this place ?
You know, I would
show you, but...
That's clever.
It's over there...
behind the map.
Where did you get this ?
Those are defense department projections
they've been doing since the 50s.
The fallout scenarios in the event of
a nuclear attack on 20 US cities.
And you see Jericho ?
It's outside the fallout zones, Jake.
It's got a salt mine,
plenty of farm land,
and access to an untainted
water table.
So you weren't here to
monitor phone calls ?
Jericho was a rally-point in case
we failed in our mission.
Failed ?
Or succeeded ?
And Johnston, was...
He wanted to come,
I know he did.
He's just having a hard time
dealing with things lately.
He always gets quiet...
when he's going through
something, but...
just wish I could think
of something
to help him get through this.
We miss you, sweetheart.
There's no more sprouts.
You finished them ?
I was hungry.
What are you doing here, Sean.
It's like 9:30 in the morning...
Oh, my...
You slept here ?
Well, actually... there was not a
lot of sleeping going on.
Get out of the house !
What are you doing ?
- You let him spend a night ?
- Yes.
Well that doesn't seem like something
Stanley would approve of, does it ?
Stanley's not here.
Just like that. You infiltrated a
terror cell planning a nuclear attack ?
Yeah...
just like that.
It took me 2 years.
8 months of it in prison...
developing contacts,
getting into the network.
The only outside person I
communicated with was my handler.
After prison,
I spent another year
trying to gain their trust
on the outside.
And even then, I was only
scratching the surface.
But you got in.
How ?
They were looking for
high grade government IDs.
You gave them their badges !
I had to proove that I was loyal
and valuable to the cell, Jake.
- I think I've heard enough.
- No !
You barely scratched
the surface.
You're the one who
wanted to hear this,
so why don't you hear it all ?
The cell was looking for IDs.
And I needed to get higher up
in their organisation.
So I let it be known
that I had a source.
See, the badges...
were going to be tagged so that
my team could track them.
They sent me to make the buy
with another cell member.
It was a kid named Daryl.
How do we know
these are real ?
They're real enough.
Where did you get them from ?
How and where I got these
badges... is my business.
What you do with them...
is yours.
- Nice doing business with you.
- You too.
We should celebrate, man.
Go out, get some girls.
Except you don't really seem
like the type. All serious.
Are you married ?
I was.
Really ?
What happened ?
What the hell is going on ?
Hold it right there !
I'm sorry man.
You gotta be kidding me.
FBI !
Hands in the air !
Back against the car.
<i>It turns out Daryl was
an FBI informant.
But my handler got me out,
and we kept my cover intact.
So the FBI have an informant
in my target cell.
And they can't tell us
anything about that ?
You know, I'm damn lucky
that my cover wasn't blown.
- Your cover's intact, yes ?
- Yeah, we believe so.
Then let's move on.
Have you been able to make contact
with those coordinating the attack ?
No... but at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells
that we've already inflitrated.
You know, at the very least that
would disrupt the overall plan...
maybe delay it for...
- How many of the bombs can you get ?
A third, for sure...
half if we're lucky.
Look... I know...
it's not ideal, but at this stage,
it is the safest move.
That's still a dozen
bombs in play.
- What are you doing ?
- I just think there's a way to...
speed this up and get
all the bombs at once.
- Yeah, and we agreed that...
- Do you mind ?
I think there may be a way
to get us further inside.
My partner tells the cell leader
that Daryl is the FBI informant.
That gives him the credibility
that he needs to move up faster.
Then let us handle the FBI...
and do whatever is necessary
to save the operation.
- It's all gonna take some time,
but we're close  - OK.
We're counting on you,
and you know the risks.
You'd better be right about this.
This is the right way to go.
Trust me.
What would you have done ?
Stayed in,
or pulled the plug ?
It seems like the wrong
question to me.
I'd ask myself how much
I trusted my partner.
Well, if I can sneak up here without
you so much as turning around...
how are you gonna
hear any game ?
I heard you half a mile
back in those shoes.
You said you'd come with me
to see April today.
Fine.
You coming home for dinner ?
There are no deer in these woods,
they've all been picked clean.
Then, I guess I'll
be here a while.
I never wanted to be a mom'.
I didn't sign up for this.
You know what, you're right.
I owe it to Stanley.
So I'm just gonna have
to jump in...
with both feet, whether she wants
to hear from me or not.
Listen to me going on
about my own problems.
You must be ady to take this hatchet
and do the damn job yourself.
I didn't know that he
knew how to sign.
What did he say to you ?
Never mind, look...
That boy's bad news.
Now, I can't stop you
from seeing him...
but he is no longer welcome in this
house, do you understand me ?
Allison...
so why do you feel like you
can't hang out at home ?
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.
It's not that I don't wanna
talk about it.
It's just...
my family's pretty weird.
My family was pretty weird too.
In fact, when I was your age, I didn't
want to hang out with them either.
What about now ?
They're gone.
There's this thing that went
down at my house...
a couple weeks ago.
I did something.
OK. What did you do ?
I did something that...
can't be forgiven.
Now my mom just keeps...
looking at me.
Like I've changed into some kind
of monster, or something.
You know you haven't, right ?
So... even though you
weren't sure about the plan,
you outed the informant
to the cell leader.
Once we decided to leave
the bombs in play,
it was the only way for me to
get deep enough into the cell
and gain their trust.
I told the cell leader that
Daryl was the informant,
but I wanted to get him out of there
before they killed him.
Come on, grab what you
need and let's go.
They're gonna hunt me down,
and they're gonna kill me.
It's your lucky day, Daryl.
They're gonna get you into witness
protection, so don't worry.
We're gonna get
you out of here.
Stay there.
- Damn it !
- What is it ?
<i>Daryl, we just wanna talk.
The cell leader.
You gotta get me
out of this place.
Run !
I'll tell them that
you got away.
I think my leg is broken.
Please, help me !
Or I'm gonna tell them
who you really are.
I'm sorry.
<i>So, I finally gain their trust.
<i>I was in.
You killed him.
It was either killed him...
or possibly let millions
of people die.
They died anyway.
<i>Jake ?
<i>You're still down there ?
Call him off.
You're not helping your cause by
keeping that gun in my face.
<i>Hey, Jake ?
Do not make me kill him Jake.
All right.
- All right !
<i>- Jake ?
What's going on, Jake ?
We need a little more
time, that's all.
- You're sure ?
- Yeah, we're all right.
- I... I'm out front.
- OK.
Turn around, Jake.
It is not about this anymore.
We're past this.
Starting now,
we trust each other.
You need to tell me everything.
Done telling.
Now, I gotta show you.
What are you doing here ?
It's your first day
at a new school.
You know, the last time you had one
of those, Sam was in diapers.
Doesn'’t look like you
had a big turnout.
No, most people left early.
I guess you knew better.
I figured you didn't really want
me around the house anyway.
Why would you say that ?
You know...
because of what I did.
Allison, I love you.
OK ? Nothing will
change that.
Hear me baby ?
Nothing will change that.
My little girl.
Mom, please
don't be mad at me.
I'm so sorry, mom'.
- Here's the part I don't get.
- What ?
If you're telling the truth...
you made it.
You made it deep inside the cell,
you gained their trust.
Right.
Then, what happened ?
Somebody tipped off the
terrorists, Jake.
Before we could find out who...
<i>the terrorists moved up
their plan.
Victor ?
We made a mistake,
<i>a very big mistake.</i>
This is the moment we prepared for.
Strike will go off tomorrow,
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.
OK. No... listen !
The trucks...
they're white.
License plate
Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...
<i>I tried to warn the agency...
<i>but we were too late.
Some of the bombs were meant
for New York.
We managed to head them off.
Even after 4 years of work...
I couldn't stop all of them.
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.
Since when have
you been funny ?
I have always been funny.
Yeah, not for a long time.
What is it Rob ?
- Rob ?
- I won't be long.
Not interrupting, am I ?
You know you are.
You're not exactly
returning our calls.
I told my wife I was done.
I promised her, Victor.
- We need you back.
- Why me ?
Because you're the best
at what you do.
Which is what ?
Your family will be there,
when you get back.
Team is meeting tomorrow.
Come listen to what this
is all about.
If you wanna walk
away after that...
you walk away.
2 o'clock...
tomorrow.
Tell the desk jockey you have an
appointment with Mr. Higgins.
If they ask about the weather...
tell hem it's gonna rain.
Who was that ?
I might need to go
to a meeting tomorow.
I can't keep doing this,
I can't.
We'll be fine, D.
What is that ?
It's the end of the
rabbit hole, Jake.
Gimme a hand with this.
So you believe me now ?
Is that what I think it is ?
It was meant for Columbus, Ohio.
You brought a nuclear bomb...
here.
What would you have
done with it ?
What do you gonna do with it ?
I'm gonna keep it safe.
I'm gonna keep it secret,
you know. Because...
it gives the town some power, Jake,
but it also makes them a target.
Look...
I know what you're thinking...
You're wishing you'd walked away
when I gave you the chance, right ?
Why didn’t you show me thing
when I walked in the door today.
You didn't walk in.
<i>Jake ?
<i>Hey, Jake ?
I've been watching you, Jake...
and you can handle yourself.
And I've seen what a help
you have been to this stown.
But I needed to know
that I can trust you.
That you could handle it
if I told you everything.
<i>Jake ?
This bomb...
it's our burden, now.
Whatever happens next...
that is gonna be
up to you. OK ?
He's FBI.
Just like he said.
But...
We're in good hands.
That's good to hear.
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Hawkins.
We do that, outside.
I didn't know that.
There’s something
I want to say to you.
I'm still learning...
so just, please bear with me.
Stanley...
is...
important...
to me.
You... are...
important... to me.
I... want... you...
to be safe.
So please... be patient...
with me.
I'm trying...
I'll try too.
So...
hug ?
Right.
I brought you some dinner.
Thank you.
<i>You know what, I am damn lucky
that my cover wasn’t blown.
<i>- Your cover's intact ?
- Yeah, we believe so.
<i>Then let's move on.
<i>But at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells
<i>that we've already
infiltrated...
<i>How many of the bombs
can you get ?
How many of the bombs
can you get ?

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Oh, my God, Ted.
- Jake, this is... Ted Lewis.
- Hey, how you doing?
We grew up together over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.
I'm gonna help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.
- You're just going to leave?
- Won't be for very long.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No, the question is: how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
- They get tired of you being sheriff?
- No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
Can we buy some more of these things?
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.
- We're going to need food.
- Won't see another crop till spring.
Spring crop is what I'm talking about.
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.
Starve next fall or freeze this winter.
Okay, look,
we'll give you the food.
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.
We're going to need ten Jericho
men to help us build them.
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?
I am not going to build
these things on credit.
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.
What you are about to do...
means this town's survival.
All right, let's move out.
If anything happens
to any of them...
you're the first one I come for.
I know.
<i>Hey, Jeff, they're back.
I didn't expect to see
you till spring, Russell.
I thought you might
be needing these.
Your windmills.
It's good to see our guys back, but...
it's going to take some time for me
to find the guys to replace them.
You don't need to replace them.
Well, now, wait...
our agreement was that
we got ten windmills
for ten percent of the crops.
You'll get your windmills,
but we don't need your men.
Constantino called it
an act of good faith.
I didn't think Constantino
knew that term.
But...
I'll take it.
Stanley!
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Where's Eric?
He didn't come back, Mary.
He said he wasn't ready.
But...
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Okay.
Thanks.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
- None of us did.
- How are you? You okay?
Where's Eric?
Come here.
He didn't come back with us.
Why not?
When I talked to him, he was still
pretty messed up about April's death.
He said he was thinking about
staying in New Bern for a while
to get his head together.
- When was this?
Three days ago.
Then, he didn't show up for work,
and I haven't seen him since.
I don't know what's
going on in New Bern.
When I asked about Eric,
they couldn't tell me anything.
Then, the cops started escorting
us wherever we went.
Then today, out of nowhere,
Russell says,
"Pack it up, we're going home",
like...
like it wasn't safe for us
there anymore.
Where's my brother?
- I don't know.
- What?
I know he hasn't been
seen for a few days.
Did you even try to find him?
- I asked Constantino.
- And?
And he told me that
they were looking for him.
And then this morning, he told me
to bring the rest of your guys home.
What the hell's going on
over there, Russell?
Should I be worried about him?
Answer me.
Should I be worried?
I would be.
- I'm going with you.
- No...
you've been gone for weeks.
Go home.
You need someone who knows
their way around New Bern.
I'll try to find Heather
as soon as I get there.
She knows it better than any of us.
Look, it's not safe out there.
You can't go by yourself.
I'm not.
I need your help.

You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china, Jake.
I got to try and find him.
I can't just...
There's something going on in that town.
I can feel it.
Stanley starts asking questions,
and they just send them home?
Okay, but you understand why
I can't just up and leave, right?
- He's my brother.
- And you said he was upset,
so maybe he just...
- If you're saying no, just say no.
Come on, Jake, I'm not saying no.
I'm saying we got to
understand the situation.
The situation is...
he's been missing for three days,
and I came to you...
for help.
Okay.
But if we do this,
we do it my way.
Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you're home.
I missed you guys so much.
You're totally back.
<i>Mrs. Green.
I'm really sorry to bother
you like this, but...
I thought you should know.
Know what?
The men came back from New Bern,
and Eric wasn't with them.
Why not?
He decided to stay a little longer.
Decided to or Constantino insisted?
Stanley talked to him.
He said...
he said he wasn't ready
to come home.
- How'd you hurt your hand?
- Oh, I just...
was trying to fix the copper
tubing on my still.
It just popped off and cut me.
Is alcohol really a priority right now?
Actually, it's not to drink.
I was trying to make antiseptic
for the med center.
I should go.
- You got any sand over there
at the bar?  - Sand?
Yeah, I think I can show you a way
around that copper tubing.
I'll just give you a hand.
See you in a bit.
Guys... yo, listen.
Stop unloading that.
Put that back.
What the hell is this?
- Salt.  - Who gave you permission
to take it from the mine?
51% of the mine belongs to me.
I just took it from my half.
You don't have a half...
of anything. Your parents do.
Look, I know you still think
of me as a child...
and I can't help it if that's
where you're stuck,
but the fact is I have
a right to what I own.
You are a minor and
you don't own anything
as long as your parents
are still alive.
Or do you have some information
that I don't have?
Look, just... just take
the salt back to the mine
and don't make me have to
send my guys to do it.
Proof of residence?
We're not from here.
Sorry, you're going to need
to turn this car around
and proceed back
the way you came.
I'm here to see my brother.
His name is Eric Green.
You're not hearing me, sir.
No one's allowed...
No, you're not hearing me.
I have to see him.
He came here as part of the deal
you made with Jericho. Now...
Hey, Jake...
I want to talk to Phil Constantino.
- Get out of the car.
- Hell, no.
Put your hands on the dashboard.
I want to see your hands.
That's Johnston Green's son.
Let him through.
I'll escort him in
to see Sheriff Constantino.
Go ahead, let him through.
<i>Mister, Mister.
Do you have any food?
I'm sorry, I don't...
I'm sorry, I don't have any.
All right, ma'am, come on.
Get those kids out of there.
Hey, come on.
<i>Come on, please.
I thought we had it bad.
What the hell happened here?
Ravenwood.
My brother is missing.
I know. I've got patrols
out looking for him.
- And no leads?
- No.
Sorry, I wish there's
more I could do.
You're the sheriff and the mayor.
You can do more.
I'm trying, Jake.
You sure Eric even
wants to be found?
What's that supposed to mean?
We all knew April.
We know what happened.
Last I heard that Eric was
having a tough time.
He'll be fine as soon as
we get him home.
You know what?
Let's face the facts.
He might have been attacked.
Could be lying in a
ditch somewhere.
- Why would you say...
- Take it easy!
The fact is some folks around here
aren't too fond of Jericho these days.
That's why I sent the workers home
today. When your brother went missing,
I got worried for their safety.
Why?
There's been a lot of rumors
flying around about your town.
What are people saying?
They're mad that Jericho didn't
warn us about Ravenwood.
They think you're going to renege
on your part of the food deal.
We've had it rough here, okay?
They're just looking for
somebody to blame.
- Where was Eric last seen?
- The factory.
End of his shift.
Look, we're just trying to help.
What is it that you want
that we're not giving?
I want to talk to Heather Lisinski.
<i>Take care of each other, Kansas.
Anything new from Mr. Hewitt?
No, it's just the same bulletin about
the riots in Chicago Camp West.
Hey, thanks for taking on a shift.
Jimmy, it's the least I can do
to make myself useful.
I feel like such a freeloader
sitting around your house all day.
You kidding me?
You're like the best houseguest ever.
You cook, you do the dishes, you
never get bored playing Boggle.
And we're dreading the day you
and your husband work things out.
That sounded a lot less
insensitive in my head.
- I'm sorry.
- No, I understand, thank you.
Listen...
can I talk you about something?
Yeah, what is it?
Last night Sam and Woody were
drawing pictures.
That's one of Sam's.
I didn't want to bring it up at
the house with everyone around,
I thought it might be upsetting.
No, I'm glad you showed
this to me.
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but that really looks like a kid
dealing with some kind of trauma.
I'm-I'm not surprised.
I mean....
30 million people died a few months ago.
I'll bet there's kids all over the
country still trying to process that.
Maybe, but it's so specific.
The bodies, the house.
He's coming by after school.
I'll talk to him then.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Sand keeps the copper from buckling.
How'd you learn this?
Well...
like... most things that
are fun and illegal...
from my dad.
So the stories Eric tells are true.
Afraid so.
You remember that book...
something about...
women are from Venus,
and men are wrong.
Not that I read the book, mind you,
but I did,  you know...
flip through Gail's copy of it.
Lot of stuff in there about
men needing to...
go off and hold up in
a cave sometime.
Now, I don't know if this was
actually in the book, but...
if men can't find a cave,
they'll make one.
Out of...
whatever circumstances happen
to be lying around.
Yeah, you're probably right.
I'm sure that's all it is.
This isn't your fault, Mary.
It wasn't anybody's fault.
I think Eric's figuring that out.
This place is the only reason New Bern
made it through the Depression.
The factory whistle's like
a heartbeat to this town.
Put the wind turbines binds
together just down here.
Sheriff!
Who's that?
It's a friend of Heather's.
We met him at Black Jack.
Good news.
- This guy knows where your brother is.
- Really? Where?
Eric went home.
He and Heather both.
They... left this morning.
- Home? To Jericho?
- Why would they do that?
Why didn't they go
with the convoy?
Well, Heather had to talk
him into going. So...
by then, the other guys had left.
So, I lent them my car
and my rifle.
They didn't seem worried at all.
Probably back in Jericho by now.
Right.
- Hope they're okay.
- Thank you.
- We got to clear the building.
- All right.
What happened?
We had to retrofit all the
machines after the EMP,
and one of them overheated.
Caught part of the building on fire.
You got what you need?
Yeah, mystery solved, I guess.
Good. Glad to hear it.
If there's nothing else, Deputy Perkins
will escort you out of town.
No. We don't need
to be escorted.
It's policy.
You're big on policy.
We almost lost everything when
Ravenwood came through here.
I'm big on anything that
keeps us alive.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Move the truck.
Let them through.
- You buying any of that story?
- Nope.
Neither was Ted.
Slipped me this when
he shook my hand.
- It's an address and...
- "Come Alone"
So, we done here?
<i>Back it up.
<i>Let them through.
How long have I been gone?
No, before you answer that,
how long has he been here?
- It's very recent really.
He hasn't been here that long.
I asked you to do one
thing for me, Mimi.
One thing!
You know, you listen
to me, Stanley.
Your sister is not a child anymore.
You can't just throw this fit
and kick Sean's ass
and think that's going
to be the end of it
I hope you're going to
explain why I can't.
Because if you do,
she's just going to latch
on that much tighter.
Unless they really get angry,
in which case, the age-old teenage
remedy is to run away,
which used to mean that they'd
hear from them in a couple of days
when they ran out of bus money.
Nowadays, chances are much better
that you'll find their bodies
on the side of a road.
Look...
right now it is under our roof.
And it's a pain in the ass, I know,
but it's a safe and manageable
pain in the ass,
and I suggest you let it stay here
before it turns into anything
more than that.
That's Perkins' truck.
What's he doing staking
out Ted's trailer?
Let's ask him.
Hand your gun to my friend,
and let's pay Ted a little visit.
Come on.
Where's my brother?
I don't know, ask him.
He threatened to throw me in jail this
morning if I didn't feed you that lie.
- So you haven't seen Eric?
- No. Not for days.
- What about Heather?
- She left for work this morning.
Next thing I know, they tell
me she's gone missing, too.
Two people disappear,
nobody knows anything?
Oh, somebody does.
Right?
Where is he?
Screw you.
Hey, come on, Jake,
we got to be smarter than that.
We need answers.
Getting answers...
is easy.
It's getting the truth...
that takes work.
When did you last see Eric Green?
Look...
this is not my thing.
I didn't ask you that, did I?
Why do you act like
we did something wrong?
We were attacked.
How do you figure that?
The those machines didn't overheat
this morning at the factory.
It was his brother...
and that girl.
They sabotaged it.
They would never do that?
We need that factory
just as much as you do.
- I saw them.
- If you saw them, then where are they?
They ran away.
Hold his knees, please.
Look,
why would I be staking out
a trailer park if we had them? Huh?
Constantino put us on alert.
He gave a SOS.
- SOS?
- Shoot on sight.
Look at me.
What is in that factory?
I don't know.
No, I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
Ask Constantino.
Ask Constantino.
He knows?
Look at me.
- We go to the factory.
- But Eric...
I don't know about Eric.
But we cannot search this whole town.
So we should go and see what it was
that he was risking his life for.
All right.
You got some place safe you can go?
Yeah, my grandfather has
an old hunting cabin.
You take what's important because
you are not coming back here.
Get up.
On your knees.
What is he doing?
- Down on your knees.
- What?
What are you doing?
Hawkins!
Is that doing it your way?
You asked me to come along.
- What were you going to do?
- You want the truth?
Less than you would have.
You see, I've done...
I've done enough, Jake,
to know better.
It's the fear of torture
that gets results.
Actual torture only works
in the movies.
And this one guy, he was
so skinny, you could
count his ribs through his shirt.
I tried to give him food when I could,
but none of us had much so...
And then one day, I could just...
see it in his eyes.
He'd, uh...
he'd given up.
I never thought I'd be so
thankful to live on a farm.
From now on, I promise
I'll only complain intermittently.
Well, we don't have much, but, uh...
we'll always have enough, so...
Dude, all they need to do
is get the Internet back up.
After that, it's a piece of cake.
Why is that?
Well, you could do anything.
I mean, you could run for president.
Make a virtual White House.
Fly a plane into that.
I mean, virtual cities and towns...
nothing to nuke.
- Yeah, but...
where would we get...
stuff?
What stuff?
I don't know.
Food, clothes, blankets, fuel.
Not a problem.
After the Internet is back up,
you just order all that stuff.
You know, Stanley,
you would not believe
how helpful Sean has been
around here with the livestock,
and the house,
and... just everything.
It's true.
Yeah, it's weird, Stanley, 'cause
I am much more of a vibe guy.
What the hell is a vibe guy?
You know...
I mean, I've never been into, like,
physical labor.
I'm more the guy that people
have around for my vibe.
My house, my rules, my vibe.
And you sleep there.
So anyhow, it's, like, 3:00 a. m.,
I've got this flashlight in my face.
Gail's over on her side of
the bed trying to find the phone
to call the cops and finally,
I located the light switch.
It's Eric,
who's standing there and he says,
"I can't go to sleep until
I confess I'm drunk. "
I said, "You're what?"
He said, "I'm drunk."
"It won't ever happen again.
I don't know what I was thinking."
Well, meantime,
he looks perfectly normal,
his speech isn't slurred or anything.
Gail starts grilling him. Turns out
he has had a beer and a half.
I said to him,
"Son, do you have any idea
how much beer it takes to get drunk?"
He said, "No, I don't. "
I said, "Well, get out of here and
don't wake me up again until you do."
He left, Gail and
I just could not stop laughing.
She doesn't laugh too much anymore.
Here I am rambling on. We probably ought
to go take a look at that still.
Good idea.
Hey, buddy.
Your mom just ran to the little
girls' room. Why don't you grab a seat?
Could you give us a minute?
Sure.
Say, you know what?
Why don't we go sit in my office,
maybe we can talk.
About what?
About your artwork.
This is Russell.
He saved our butts out
at the Black Jack.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm Skylar.
Stevens, right?
Something we can help you with?
Well, I was thinking
we could help each other.
You've got a salt mine
with no real distributor.
I've got men, trucks, guns,
but no supplies.
- If we become partners...
- Partners?
I'm asking for half
your share of the mine.
We're doing okay now.
Okay, but the people in Jericho,
they only need so much salt.
I've been out there.
I know the trade routes,
where to find the highest bidders
and how to make it
back here in one piece.
What's in it for us?
Bigger profits.
Where I'm going, I can get you
five times what you can make here.
And...
I'll deal with Gray Anderson for you.
When do you need an answer?
Before I leave in the morning.
Believe me,
this is good for everyone.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
It's our mine.
And our town.
They sliced it up like they own it.
What do they know that we don't?
Come on.
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?
We were talking about my drawings.
Look, do you mind waiting
in the lobby a minute?
I just need to talk to
Mr. Taylor alone. Okay?
What are you doing?
Darcy, something going on,
and it's not just about the bombs.
My son has enough to deal with,
you know, without
being poked and prodded.
If there's a problem with him,
I'll take care of it myself.
Right.
Thank you.
For what?
Letting Sean stay.
You're welcome.
And for not calling him an idiot
even when he is done.
Okay, if you know that...
Sorry. Just a little frog
in my throat.
Don't let me interrupt your nice
sibling-bonding moment.
That's what it is, right?
Sean can be an idiot,
but he can also be really great.
All guys are like that,
you have to put up with the
"idiot" stuff...
to get to the "great" stuff.
Yeah? And where did you come
by that litlle pearl of wisdom?
What did she say about me?
When did he learn how to sign?
He's sleeping with a deaf girl.
That's my sister.
I guess if Sean Henthorn is
my biggest problem, then
I'm a pretty lucky guy.
Want to get luckier?
What are you doing?
It's binding.
The lawyer said it makes me
an emancipated minor.
By declaring your parents dead?
This is wrong
in every way that
something can be wrong.
- Let's just forget about this.
- You can't do that.
- It's legal.
- So,
what, are you gonna pedal your little
bike to Topeka and file this, Dale?
Forget that I'm the mayor.
Okay, I'm speaking to you as
your parents' friend.
My parents would want me to have
my share of the salt mine
Your parents are coming back.
And if it turns out that
that is not true,
then I will help you learn the business.
And who decides when that happens?
You?
I mean my decision, are you saying
laws don't apply any more?
You didn't make a decision.
You signed a piece of paper.
Do you really want your parents
to be dead that badly?
- Okay, stop it.
- No.
You're advising her, Dale.
Did you also tell her
how her parents died?
Because New York survived,
so I guess you probably had
to get pretty creative, right?
Were they killed there?
Or were they murdered
on their way back
to the child who meant
everything to them?
It's just a piece of paper.
Come on.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're running a munitions factory.
Hurry up.
Constantino wants those tonight.
We'll have them ready.
They're getting ready for war.
We need to get back to town.
No, we need to try and stop them.
Cover me.
Hey, there he goes.
Down there.
Hold it!
Hand it over.
Sorry. I guess I'm late for dinner.
Or lunch.
Take your pick.
I was helping Mary.
It took longer than I expected.
You told Eric we'd take care of her.
What I meant was that
we'd help keep her alive.
What I didn't mean was that
we'd run over there
and spend the entire day
every time she needed
somebody to do
a little heavy lifting.
Wait.
You don't think
I'm the reason Eric left?
Do you?
Is that what you think?
I think Eric left for
a lot of reasons...
...but Mary may be why he comes back.
I don't want to have to come back
to this house again.
Did you get all the toys you want?
So,
what did you and Mr. Taylor
talk about today?
Nothing.
Now, Sam, you know we don't keep
secrets in this family.
Yeah, I know, baby.
What's he doing here?
I think we should talk.
Hey, Sam, honey,
why don't you go upstairs
to your room and
get that last box, okay?
Hey, buddy.
Look, I-I understand, you know,
you being curious about my family.
We haven't made a lot of friends here.
We just kind of keep to ourselves, but
if you want to ask any questions,
just talk to me, okay?
Leave my children out of it.
But I think Sam's trying to say
something with that drawing.
Something he can't put into words.
What do you mean?
He's drawing a little boy
that's afraid...
...because his dad's not
around to protect him
or his family.
I told him he's not alone.
I know what it's like to have
parents who have split up.
I told him
I'd been through it, and...
I think I turned out okay, so...
I think you turned out better
than okay, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
So, I guess I'll head back
to the house then.
See you there.
Thank you, Jimmy.
Sure.
- How did it go?
- Good.
Turbines all went up without a hitch.
Thank...
Thank you.
You were as good as your word.
Even better.
I'm glad you see it that way,
because I have another
proposition for you.
We need salt.
Well, it's no problem.
I'll have my guys load up your truck.
Well, actually,
I mean to help you sell it.
We were thinking
a quarter stake in the mine.
Would we be Constantino?
Is that what all of
this good will was about?
No. Hear me out.
This will work for both of us.
For both of our towns.
If you agree to let me sell salt
from the mine.
I'm sorry.
I guess you and the, uh, Olsen twins
think this is kind of cute.
Well, for whatever it's worth,
we did conduct a legal transaction.
- Not for sale.
- Your people on New Bern
who think it should be.
- I don't care what they think.
You need to.
When I saw that
map of Jericho,
I asked Heather about it.
She didn't think
New Bern could do that to us.
Then she snuck in, and, uh...
she saw the mortars and...
their plans.
Look, you're going back to whatever
rock you crawled out from under.
Dan, get in here!
Mr. Mayor, there's a lot more
going on here than you realize.
- Is that so?
- I'm trying to help you.
Look, New Bern barely
survived the winter.
And the people there, they know
the food is coming from you.
And they also know that it's not going
to be enough to feed everyone,
and so, some of them, they're thinking,
what can we do about that
right now?
I want you to find every deputy you can
and get them up to the salt mine.
I want it under heavy guard
until further notice.
Gray, I've already got men up there.
Gray, listen to me.
This deal is a good thing.
I know you don't see it that way
right now, but please,
you do not want the alternative.
These rumors about Jericho,
about the food hoarding,
about how they sicced Ravenwood on us...
maybe they're not just rumors.
We restored their power supply,
and now that Jericho has what it needs,
it has no intention of making good
on its half of the deal.
Why didn't you just leave town?
'Cause we wanted to break the machine,
stop the factory.
Then they caught us.
They brought me here.
So, where is she?
Where is Heather?
She's dead, Jake.
But it's not enough for them
to keep their food
and leave us to starve.
You, up. You, too.
They want to see us destroyed.
I looked their mayor in the eye,
I told him how desperate
our situation was.
But on the day
that we made good
on our end of the deal,
what did they do?
They tried to destroy the factory
that keeps this town alive.
Here's your proof.
These are the sons of Johnston Green,
sent from Jericho to wreak
havoc on this town.
Now we know,
if these people had their way,
New Bern would cease to exist.
With your help
and sacrifice,
I will make sure that
that never happens.

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Oh, my God, Ted.
- Jake, this is... Ted Lewis.
- Hey, how you doing?
We grew up together over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.
I'm gonna help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.
- You're just going to leave?
- Won't be for very long.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No, the question is: how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
- They get tired of you being sheriff?
- No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
Can we buy some more of these things?
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.
- We're going to need food.
- Won't see another crop till spring.
Spring crop is what I'm talking about.
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.
Starve next fall or freeze this winter.
Okay, look,
we'll give you the food.
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.
We're going to need ten Jericho
men to help us build them.
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?
I am not going to build
these things on credit.
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.
What you are about to do...
means this town's survival.
All right, let's move out.
If anything happens
to any of them...
you're the first one I come for.
I know.
<i>Hey, Jeff, they're back.
I didn't expect to see
you till spring, Russell.
I thought you might
be needing these.
Your windmills.
It's good to see our guys back, but...
it's going to take some time for me
to find the guys to replace them.
You don't need to replace them.
Well, now, wait...
our agreement was that
we got ten windmills
for ten percent of the crops.
You'll get your windmills,
but we don't need your men.
Constantino called it
an act of good faith.
I didn't think Constantino
knew that term.
But...
I'll take it.
Stanley!
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Where's Eric?
He didn't come back, Mary.
He said he wasn't ready.
But...
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Okay.
Thanks.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
- None of us did.
- How are you? You okay?
Where's Eric?
Come here.
He didn't come back with us.
Why not?
When I talked to him, he was still
pretty messed up about April's death.
He said he was thinking about
staying in New Bern for a while
to get his head together.
- When was this?
Three days ago.
Then, he didn't show up for work,
and I haven't seen him since.
I don't know what's
going on in New Bern.
When I asked about Eric,
they couldn't tell me anything.
Then, the cops started escorting
us wherever we went.
Then today, out of nowhere,
Russell says,
"Pack it up, we're going home",
like...
like it wasn't safe for us
there anymore.
Where's my brother?
- I don't know.
- What?
I know he hasn't been
seen for a few days.
Did you even try to find him?
- I asked Constantino.
- And?
And he told me that
they were looking for him.
And then this morning, he told me
to bring the rest of your guys home.
What the hell's going on
over there, Russell?
Should I be worried about him?
Answer me.
Should I be worried?
I would be.
- I'm going with you.
- No...
you've been gone for weeks.
Go home.
You need someone who knows
their way around New Bern.
I'll try to find Heather
as soon as I get there.
She knows it better than any of us.
Look, it's not safe out there.
You can't go by yourself.
I'm not.
I need your help.

You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china, Jake.
I got to try and find him.
I can't just...
There's something going on in that town.
I can feel it.
Stanley starts asking questions,
and they just send them home?
Okay, but you understand why
I can't just up and leave, right?
- He's my brother.
- And you said he was upset,
so maybe he just...
- If you're saying no, just say no.
Come on, Jake, I'm not saying no.
I'm saying we got to
understand the situation.
The situation is...
he's been missing for three days,
and I came to you...
for help.
Okay.
But if we do this,
we do it my way.
Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you're home.
I missed you guys so much.
You're totally back.
<i>Mrs. Green.
I'm really sorry to bother
you like this, but...
I thought you should know.
Know what?
The men came back from New Bern,
and Eric wasn't with them.
Why not?
He decided to stay a little longer.
Decided to or Constantino insisted?
Stanley talked to him.
He said...
he said he wasn't ready
to come home.
- How'd you hurt your hand?
- Oh, I just...
was trying to fix the copper
tubing on my still.
It just popped off and cut me.
Is alcohol really a priority right now?
Actually, it's not to drink.
I was trying to make antiseptic
for the med center.
I should go.
- You got any sand over there
at the bar?  - Sand?
Yeah, I think I can show you a way
around that copper tubing.
I'll just give you a hand.
See you in a bit.
Guys... yo, listen.
Stop unloading that.
Put that back.
What the hell is this?
- Salt.  - Who gave you permission
to take it from the mine?
51% of the mine belongs to me.
I just took it from my half.
You don't have a half...
of anything. Your parents do.
Look, I know you still think
of me as a child...
and I can't help it if that's
where you're stuck,
but the fact is I have
a right to what I own.
You are a minor and
you don't own anything
as long as your parents
are still alive.
Or do you have some information
that I don't have?
Look, just... just take
the salt back to the mine
and don't make me have to
send my guys to do it.
Proof of residence?
We're not from here.
Sorry, you're going to need
to turn this car around
and proceed back
the way you came.
I'm here to see my brother.
His name is Eric Green.
You're not hearing me, sir.
No one's allowed...
No, you're not hearing me.
I have to see him.
He came here as part of the deal
you made with Jericho. Now...
Hey, Jake...
I want to talk to Phil Constantino.
- Get out of the car.
- Hell, no.
Put your hands on the dashboard.
I want to see your hands.
That's Johnston Green's son.
Let him through.
I'll escort him in
to see Sheriff Constantino.
Go ahead, let him through.
<i>Mister, Mister.
Do you have any food?
I'm sorry, I don't...
I'm sorry, I don't have any.
All right, ma'am, come on.
Get those kids out of there.
Hey, come on.
<i>Come on, please.
I thought we had it bad.
What the hell happened here?
Ravenwood.
My brother is missing.
I know. I've got patrols
out looking for him.
- And no leads?
- No.
Sorry, I wish there's
more I could do.
You're the sheriff and the mayor.
You can do more.
I'm trying, Jake.
You sure Eric even
wants to be found?
What's that supposed to mean?
We all knew April.
We know what happened.
Last I heard that Eric was
having a tough time.
He'll be fine as soon as
we get him home.
You know what?
Let's face the facts.
He might have been attacked.
Could be lying in a
ditch somewhere.
- Why would you say...
- Take it easy!
The fact is some folks around here
aren't too fond of Jericho these days.
That's why I sent the workers home
today. When your brother went missing,
I got worried for their safety.
Why?
There's been a lot of rumors
flying around about your town.
What are people saying?
They're mad that Jericho didn't
warn us about Ravenwood.
They think you're going to renege
on your part of the food deal.
We've had it rough here, okay?
They're just looking for
somebody to blame.
- Where was Eric last seen?
- The factory.
End of his shift.
Look, we're just trying to help.
What is it that you want
that we're not giving?
I want to talk to Heather Lisinski.
<i>Take care of each other, Kansas.
Anything new from Mr. Hewitt?
No, it's just the same bulletin about
the riots in Chicago Camp West.
Hey, thanks for taking on a shift.
Jimmy, it's the least I can do
to make myself useful.
I feel like such a freeloader
sitting around your house all day.
You kidding me?
You're like the best houseguest ever.
You cook, you do the dishes, you
never get bored playing Boggle.
And we're dreading the day you
and your husband work things out.
That sounded a lot less
insensitive in my head.
- I'm sorry.
- No, I understand, thank you.
Listen...
can I talk you about something?
Yeah, what is it?
Last night Sam and Woody were
drawing pictures.
That's one of Sam's.
I didn't want to bring it up at
the house with everyone around,
I thought it might be upsetting.
No, I'm glad you showed
this to me.
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but that really looks like a kid
dealing with some kind of trauma.
I'm-I'm not surprised.
I mean....
30 million people died a few months ago.
I'll bet there's kids all over the
country still trying to process that.
Maybe, but it's so specific.
The bodies, the house.
He's coming by after school.
I'll talk to him then.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Sand keeps the copper from buckling.
How'd you learn this?
Well...
like... most things that
are fun and illegal...
from my dad.
So the stories Eric tells are true.
Afraid so.
You remember that book...
something about...
women are from Venus,
and men are wrong.
Not that I read the book, mind you,
but I did,  you know...
flip through Gail's copy of it.
Lot of stuff in there about
men needing to...
go off and hold up in
a cave sometime.
Now, I don't know if this was
actually in the book, but...
if men can't find a cave,
they'll make one.
Out of...
whatever circumstances happen
to be lying around.
Yeah, you're probably right.
I'm sure that's all it is.
This isn't your fault, Mary.
It wasn't anybody's fault.
I think Eric's figuring that out.
This place is the only reason New Bern
made it through the Depression.
The factory whistle's like
a heartbeat to this town.
Put the wind turbines binds
together just down here.
Sheriff!
Who's that?
It's a friend of Heather's.
We met him at Black Jack.
Good news.
- This guy knows where your brother is.
- Really? Where?
Eric went home.
He and Heather both.
They... left this morning.
- Home? To Jericho?
- Why would they do that?
Why didn't they go
with the convoy?
Well, Heather had to talk
him into going. So...
by then, the other guys had left.
So, I lent them my car
and my rifle.
They didn't seem worried at all.
Probably back in Jericho by now.
Right.
- Hope they're okay.
- Thank you.
- We got to clear the building.
- All right.
What happened?
We had to retrofit all the
machines after the EMP,
and one of them overheated.
Caught part of the building on fire.
You got what you need?
Yeah, mystery solved, I guess.
Good. Glad to hear it.
If there's nothing else, Deputy Perkins
will escort you out of town.
No. We don't need
to be escorted.
It's policy.
You're big on policy.
We almost lost everything when
Ravenwood came through here.
I'm big on anything that
keeps us alive.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Move the truck.
Let them through.
- You buying any of that story?
- Nope.
Neither was Ted.
Slipped me this when
he shook my hand.
- It's an address and...
- "Come Alone"
So, we done here?
<i>Back it up.
<i>Let them through.
How long have I been gone?
No, before you answer that,
how long has he been here?
- It's very recent really.
He hasn't been here that long.
I asked you to do one
thing for me, Mimi.
One thing!
You know, you listen
to me, Stanley.
Your sister is not a child anymore.
You can't just throw this fit
and kick Sean's ass
and think that's going
to be the end of it
I hope you're going to
explain why I can't.
Because if you do,
she's just going to latch
on that much tighter.
Unless they really get angry,
in which case, the age-old teenage
remedy is to run away,
which used to mean that they'd
hear from them in a couple of days
when they ran out of bus money.
Nowadays, chances are much better
that you'll find their bodies
on the side of a road.
Look...
right now it is under our roof.
And it's a pain in the ass, I know,
but it's a safe and manageable
pain in the ass,
and I suggest you let it stay here
before it turns into anything
more than that.
That's Perkins' truck.
What's he doing staking
out Ted's trailer?
Let's ask him.
Hand your gun to my friend,
and let's pay Ted a little visit.
Come on.
Where's my brother?
I don't know, ask him.
He threatened to throw me in jail this
morning if I didn't feed you that lie.
- So you haven't seen Eric?
- No. Not for days.
- What about Heather?
- She left for work this morning.
Next thing I know, they tell
me she's gone missing, too.
Two people disappear,
nobody knows anything?
Oh, somebody does.
Right?
Where is he?
Screw you.
Hey, come on, Jake,
we got to be smarter than that.
We need answers.
Getting answers...
is easy.
It's getting the truth...
that takes work.
When did you last see Eric Green?
Look...
this is not my thing.
I didn't ask you that, did I?
Why do you act like
we did something wrong?
We were attacked.
How do you figure that?
The those machines didn't overheat
this morning at the factory.
It was his brother...
and that girl.
They sabotaged it.
They would never do that?
We need that factory
just as much as you do.
- I saw them.
- If you saw them, then where are they?
They ran away.
Hold his knees, please.
Look,
why would I be staking out
a trailer park if we had them? Huh?
Constantino put us on alert.
He gave a SOS.
- SOS?
- Shoot on sight.
Look at me.
What is in that factory?
I don't know.
No, I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
Ask Constantino.
Ask Constantino.
He knows?
Look at me.
- We go to the factory.
- But Eric...
I don't know about Eric.
But we cannot search this whole town.
So we should go and see what it was
that he was risking his life for.
All right.
You got some place safe you can go?
Yeah, my grandfather has
an old hunting cabin.
You take what's important because
you are not coming back here.
Get up.
On your knees.
What is he doing?
- Down on your knees.
- What?
What are you doing?
Hawkins!
Is that doing it your way?
You asked me to come along.
- What were you going to do?
- You want the truth?
Less than you would have.
You see, I've done...
I've done enough, Jake,
to know better.
It's the fear of torture
that gets results.
Actual torture only works
in the movies.
And this one guy, he was
so skinny, you could
count his ribs through his shirt.
I tried to give him food when I could,
but none of us had much so...
And then one day, I could just...
see it in his eyes.
He'd, uh...
he'd given up.
I never thought I'd be so
thankful to live on a farm.
From now on, I promise
I'll only complain intermittently.
Well, we don't have much, but, uh...
we'll always have enough, so...
Dude, all they need to do
is get the Internet back up.
After that, it's a piece of cake.
Why is that?
Well, you could do anything.
I mean, you could run for president.
Make a virtual White House.
Fly a plane into that.
I mean, virtual cities and towns...
nothing to nuke.
- Yeah, but...
where would we get...
stuff?
What stuff?
I don't know.
Food, clothes, blankets, fuel.
Not a problem.
After the Internet is back up,
you just order all that stuff.
You know, Stanley,
you would not believe
how helpful Sean has been
around here with the livestock,
and the house,
and... just everything.
It's true.
Yeah, it's weird, Stanley, 'cause
I am much more of a vibe guy.
What the hell is a vibe guy?
You know...
I mean, I've never been into, like,
physical labor.
I'm more the guy that people
have around for my vibe.
My house, my rules, my vibe.
And you sleep there.
So anyhow, it's, like, 3:00 a. m.,
I've got this flashlight in my face.
Gail's over on her side of
the bed trying to find the phone
to call the cops and finally,
I located the light switch.
It's Eric,
who's standing there and he says,
"I can't go to sleep until
I confess I'm drunk. "
I said, "You're what?"
He said, "I'm drunk."
"It won't ever happen again.
I don't know what I was thinking."
Well, meantime,
he looks perfectly normal,
his speech isn't slurred or anything.
Gail starts grilling him. Turns out
he has had a beer and a half.
I said to him,
"Son, do you have any idea
how much beer it takes to get drunk?"
He said, "No, I don't. "
I said, "Well, get out of here and
don't wake me up again until you do."
He left, Gail and
I just could not stop laughing.
She doesn't laugh too much anymore.
Here I am rambling on. We probably ought
to go take a look at that still.
Good idea.
Hey, buddy.
Your mom just ran to the little
girls' room. Why don't you grab a seat?
Could you give us a minute?
Sure.
Say, you know what?
Why don't we go sit in my office,
maybe we can talk.
About what?
About your artwork.
This is Russell.
He saved our butts out
at the Black Jack.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm Skylar.
Stevens, right?
Something we can help you with?
Well, I was thinking
we could help each other.
You've got a salt mine
with no real distributor.
I've got men, trucks, guns,
but no supplies.
- If we become partners...
- Partners?
I'm asking for half
your share of the mine.
We're doing okay now.
Okay, but the people in Jericho,
they only need so much salt.
I've been out there.
I know the trade routes,
where to find the highest bidders
and how to make it
back here in one piece.
What's in it for us?
Bigger profits.
Where I'm going, I can get you
five times what you can make here.
And...
I'll deal with Gray Anderson for you.
When do you need an answer?
Before I leave in the morning.
Believe me,
this is good for everyone.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
It's our mine.
And our town.
They sliced it up like they own it.
What do they know that we don't?
Come on.
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?
We were talking about my drawings.
Look, do you mind waiting
in the lobby a minute?
I just need to talk to
Mr. Taylor alone. Okay?
What are you doing?
Darcy, something going on,
and it's not just about the bombs.
My son has enough to deal with,
you know, without
being poked and prodded.
If there's a problem with him,
I'll take care of it myself.
Right.
Thank you.
For what?
Letting Sean stay.
You're welcome.
And for not calling him an idiot
even when he is done.
Okay, if you know that...
Sorry. Just a little frog
in my throat.
Don't let me interrupt your nice
sibling-bonding moment.
That's what it is, right?
Sean can be an idiot,
but he can also be really great.
All guys are like that,
you have to put up with the
"idiot" stuff...
to get to the "great" stuff.
Yeah? And where did you come
by that litlle pearl of wisdom?
What did she say about me?
When did he learn how to sign?
He's sleeping with a deaf girl.
That's my sister.
I guess if Sean Henthorn is
my biggest problem, then
I'm a pretty lucky guy.
Want to get luckier?
What are you doing?
It's binding.
The lawyer said it makes me
an emancipated minor.
By declaring your parents dead?
This is wrong
in every way that
something can be wrong.
- Let's just forget about this.
- You can't do that.
- It's legal.
- So,
what, are you gonna pedal your little
bike to Topeka and file this, Dale?
Forget that I'm the mayor.
Okay, I'm speaking to you as
your parents' friend.
My parents would want me to have
my share of the salt mine
Your parents are coming back.
And if it turns out that
that is not true,
then I will help you learn the business.
And who decides when that happens?
You?
I mean my decision, are you saying
laws don't apply any more?
You didn't make a decision.
You signed a piece of paper.
Do you really want your parents
to be dead that badly?
- Okay, stop it.
- No.
You're advising her, Dale.
Did you also tell her
how her parents died?
Because New York survived,
so I guess you probably had
to get pretty creative, right?
Were they killed there?
Or were they murdered
on their way back
to the child who meant
everything to them?
It's just a piece of paper.
Come on.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're running a munitions factory.
Hurry up.
Constantino wants those tonight.
We'll have them ready.
They're getting ready for war.
We need to get back to town.
No, we need to try and stop them.
Cover me.
Hey, there he goes.
Down there.
Hold it!
Hand it over.
Sorry. I guess I'm late for dinner.
Or lunch.
Take your pick.
I was helping Mary.
It took longer than I expected.
You told Eric we'd take care of her.
What I meant was that
we'd help keep her alive.
What I didn't mean was that
we'd run over there
and spend the entire day
every time she needed
somebody to do
a little heavy lifting.
Wait.
You don't think
I'm the reason Eric left?
Do you?
Is that what you think?
I think Eric left for
a lot of reasons...
...but Mary may be why he comes back.
I don't want to have to come back
to this house again.
Did you get all the toys you want?
So,
what did you and Mr. Taylor
talk about today?
Nothing.
Now, Sam, you know we don't keep
secrets in this family.
Yeah, I know, baby.
What's he doing here?
I think we should talk.
Hey, Sam, honey,
why don't you go upstairs
to your room and
get that last box, okay?
Hey, buddy.
Look, I-I understand, you know,
you being curious about my family.
We haven't made a lot of friends here.
We just kind of keep to ourselves, but
if you want to ask any questions,
just talk to me, okay?
Leave my children out of it.
But I think Sam's trying to say
something with that drawing.
Something he can't put into words.
What do you mean?
He's drawing a little boy
that's afraid...
...because his dad's not
around to protect him
or his family.
I told him he's not alone.
I know what it's like to have
parents who have split up.
I told him
I'd been through it, and...
I think I turned out okay, so...
I think you turned out better
than okay, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
So, I guess I'll head back
to the house then.
See you there.
Thank you, Jimmy.
Sure.
- How did it go?
- Good.
Turbines all went up without a hitch.
Thank...
Thank you.
You were as good as your word.
Even better.
I'm glad you see it that way,
because I have another
proposition for you.
We need salt.
Well, it's no problem.
I'll have my guys load up your truck.
Well, actually,
I mean to help you sell it.
We were thinking
a quarter stake in the mine.
Would we be Constantino?
Is that what all of
this good will was about?
No. Hear me out.
This will work for both of us.
For both of our towns.
If you agree to let me sell salt
from the mine.
I'm sorry.
I guess you and the, uh, Olsen twins
think this is kind of cute.
Well, for whatever it's worth,
we did conduct a legal transaction.
- Not for sale.
- Your people on New Bern
who think it should be.
- I don't care what they think.
You need to.
When I saw that
map of Jericho,
I asked Heather about it.
She didn't think
New Bern could do that to us.
Then she snuck in, and, uh...
she saw the mortars and...
their plans.
Look, you're going back to whatever
rock you crawled out from under.
Dan, get in here!
Mr. Mayor, there's a lot more
going on here than you realize.
- Is that so?
- I'm trying to help you.
Look, New Bern barely
survived the winter.
And the people there, they know
the food is coming from you.
And they also know that it's not going
to be enough to feed everyone,
and so, some of them, they're thinking,
what can we do about that
right now?
I want you to find every deputy you can
and get them up to the salt mine.
I want it under heavy guard
until further notice.
Gray, I've already got men up there.
Gray, listen to me.
This deal is a good thing.
I know you don't see it that way
right now, but please,
you do not want the alternative.
These rumors about Jericho,
about the food hoarding,
about how they sicced Ravenwood on us...
maybe they're not just rumors.
We restored their power supply,
and now that Jericho has what it needs,
it has no intention of making good
on its half of the deal.
Why didn't you just leave town?
'Cause we wanted to break the machine,
stop the factory.
Then they caught us.
They brought me here.
So, where is she?
Where is Heather?
She's dead, Jake.
But it's not enough for them
to keep their food
and leave us to starve.
You, up. You, too.
They want to see us destroyed.
I looked their mayor in the eye,
I told him how desperate
our situation was.
But on the day
that we made good
on our end of the deal,
what did they do?
They tried to destroy the factory
that keeps this town alive.
Here's your proof.
These are the sons of Johnston Green,
sent from Jericho to wreak
havoc on this town.
Now we know,
if these people had their way,
New Bern would cease to exist.
With your help
and sacrifice,
I will make sure that
that never happens.

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
We're the United States Marines
and we're here to help.
- Lance Corporal Mullen.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.
- Is any of this real?
- The gun's real.
Hands up!
Get 'em up!
You're a smart girl.
You need to get out before
these guys get you killed.
And go where?
Justin, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
The question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?
They get tired of you being sheriff?
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
This thing work?
We get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
Can we buy some more
of these things?
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.
We're gonna need food.
Ten wind turbines
for let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, we'll give you the food.
We're gonna need ten Jericho men
to help us build it.
What you are about to do
means this town's survival.
All right, let's move out.
Anything happens to any of them...
you're the first one I come for.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliceit up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
Come on.
This doesn't look good.
It could turn into a
full-blown riot.
As our guys show up,
you keep them back out of sight.
I don't want those New Bern
guys getting trigger-happy.
This salt mine is
private property!
You have 30 seconds to
get the hell out of here!
What did I tell you, Ted?
Sorry.
I knew it was you.
Yeah, but if it wasn't me...
you just gave up my name.
I want you to tell me
who your friend is
and where I can find him.
Things are gonna get
very bad for you
and your brother,
vxyou don't help us, Jake.
Why would I want to help you?
This is what I know...
is that you, your friend
and your brother
were caught attempting to sabotage
this town's sole means of manufacture.
Manufacturing weapons. You were man...
So I'm gonna
repeat the question:
Where is your friend?
Why don't you tell me what
vvhappened to Heather Lisinski?
Take him back.
Let's go, boy.
Word's gonna get back.
It's gonna get back to Jericho
about what you're doing,
and there's nothing you
can do to stop it!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Looks like they went easy on you.
- Yeah, for now.
They haven't found Hawkins yet.
We're gonna get out of here.
How many people have to die
before you don't care anymore?
April's death was not your fault.
I can't even be sure Heather's dead
with the lies they're spreading.
I've seen, Jake.
I don't think I can go back.
Staying here and getting
yourself killed
isn't going to make you
feel any better, trust me.
Remember the time
I was supposed to...
wake you up for that meteor shower?
Yeah, it was supposed
to be this...
once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Anyway...
you were so pissed at me,
so I finally gave up
and let you sleep.
I'm not giving up this time.
I should arrest you right here!
It's not his fault. We had to deal
with him in New Bern.
Gray, what the hell is this?
There's no deal!
I'm not giving away anything!
Listen, we'll think of something.
Right now we need to stand down.
No, we're not leaving
without our salt.
- It's not worth people getting hurt.
- She's right.
- All right, everybody...
- What are you doing?
Dale, I'm not going to
let people get killed.
- This was your idea.
- This is over!
Get your guys out of here!
Hey! Gray, come on!

How many more are there?
I'm not sure.
Six, maybe seven.
We need gurneys.
What happened?
Some guys from New Bern showed up
trying to steal our salt.
There was a shootout.
Oh, my God!
Okay, Harry...
Harry, we're gonna get you
cleaned up, buddy, okay?
All right, you need me
to look at your arm?
No, it's okay. I can wait.
We shouldn't be patching
those guys up.
We should be arresting them.
They opened fire on us!
We don't know who shot first, all right?
I'll get to an investigation.
Right now we need to make
sure people don't die.
Oh, my God.
Get him to Kenchy... now.
Could we get some ice, please?
She twisted her ankle.
I'm fine.
Hang on.
Hold on, Harry.
Hey, Mrs. Carmichael.
Is he gonna be all right?
No, he's not gonna be all right!
I didn't want this to happen.
Why should we expect
anything different?
As long as you and your boyfriend are
all set, the rest of us can go to hell!
Wouldn't your father be proud?
What is that supposed to mean?
Okay, come on.
She's just nervous.
Caroline, take a look at
her ankle, will ya?
Don't worry about it.
Gail, we heard about the shooting.
I brought the antiseptic
I've been working on.
What can we do to help?
Look, I need charts on
everybody who's checked in.
Annie, show her how to
fill one out, will ya?
- What's all this gonna mean for Eric?
- I don't know.
But haven't we heard anything?
I told you I don't know.
Johnston's working on it.
Now what I could use is a roll
of gauze and some bandages.
They're on the cart
next to the ultrasound.
I just don't know
what that looks like.
Never mind. I'll do it myself.
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?!
You didn't have to bring
rangers in there.
I was protec...
What?!
I'm afraid we've had
our first fatality.
One of your guys
from New Bern...
Dawson.
I didn't get the first name.
Jim Dawson.
You have got to let me
go back to New Bern
and tell them that you support
this salt mine deal.
No, that's not happening.
If they so much as think that
you fired the first shot...
- The who fi... What?
- Come on, Gray.
We need to work together
while we still can.
Things are bad in New Bern.
And when they find out
that six of us came here
and only five are coming back...
What are you saying, Russell?
You got people there.
You should bring 'em home.
Eric's still there.
Johnston, you need
to know something.
vEric hasn't been seen
for a few days.
And yesterday, Jake went
back there to try and find him.
You're telling me this now?
All right, come on. We leave now,
we can get there before dawn.
- No, no, no. I'm not authori...
- Did you hear him?
Constantino wants a bigger fight.
He's not gonna have
my sons as human shields.
Let's go!
Maggie?
Of all the jail cells, right?
Hardly recognize you
without your wardrobe.
What happened?
You guys get caught?
Kind of hard to pull that
voff without the tank.
We...
pretty much split up after Jericho.
I came to New Bern with
a couple of the guys,
but we got turned away at the border
a few weeks ago.
I was dumb enough to try
and sneak back in.
Why? This place is hell.
- It's worse out there.
- Really? That's hard to imagine.
I heard you two got dragged
in front of the Town Hall.
I don't want to scare you, Jake,
but you gotta get out of here.
It isn't exactly easy.
You could do it if you
got someone outside.
Why?
Do you?
Know someone outside?
No.
I'm just trying to help.
Last time you tried to help,
you nearly wiped out
my town's supplies.
- I was trying to survive.
- Yeah, so were we.
Look, I'm not saying it was right.
We had something people
wanted and we used it.
That's how it works.
You think you're helpless in here?
You're not.
Not if you have something they want.
What makes you think
I have something they want?
I don't think they're beating
the two of you up for fun.
Even if I did have something,
I wouldn't give it to them.
You're right. You shouldn't.
But I could.
Yeah, right.
No, thanks.
Listen, if you talk... they're going
to throw you back in your cell.
There's no way they're letting
either of you out of here.
But if I had the information,
I could trade it for my freedom.
And I can go get help.
What... give myself up
to get you out?
So I can get all three of us out.
And you can take me
back to Jericho.
I can't go anywhere without you.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Get up!
Hey, where are you taking him?
He's already told you
everything he knows!
How are things here?
Harry's going to be okay, but...
I'm worried about the staff.
Everybody's exhausted.
You sure you're okay to drive?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Better hit the road.
Be careful.
If I lose all three of you...
I swear to God...
I'm going to bring them home.
You get some sleep.
Got to go.
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?
Jake, just give me a chance, please.
We can end this.
His name is Robert Hawkins.
He said he's probably in a hunting cabin
owned by a guy named Ted Lewis.
He works at the factory.
Find out where it is.
Get over there.
You're supposed to
take me with you.
What?
That's... the deal I made
with Constantino.
I go with you, and as soon as
you see the guy's there,
you drop me off at the checkpoint.
Just talk to Constantino.
This is... he was supposed
to be here!
Take her with you.
If he's not there, kill her.
This is Johnston Green
from Jericho.
- We need talk to the sheriff.
- He's up at the cabin.
We have orders
he's not to be interrupted.
He'll want to be
interrupted for this.
It's not exactly Mayberry, is it?
Not since Ravenwood.
How are you with a rifle?
I hunted jackrabbits before.
Well, I've never shot a person,
if that's what you're asking.
We need to go back to the factory.
We need mortars.
Well, for what?
We can't launch them
over that fence.
We're not going
to launch them from here.
Phil.
Nice spread you got here.
I always wanted you
to see this place.
Well, I just...
wish it were under
better circumstances.
I just found out Eric's been
missing a couple of days.
I'd like a little update on that.
And there was an incident
at the salt mine.
Some of our people got hurt.
Let's take a walk.
<i>I'll go around back.</i>
<i>I got the front.
You watch her.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
You better hope he's home.
This mine deal,
this is your idea?
I thought it could help the town,
create a partnership.
- That didn't quite work out, did it?
- It was...
mishandled all the way around.
We were hoping we could
reach some agreement.
It's a little late for that.
You opened fire on our citizens.
- We don't know who shot first.
- Come on, Phil.
A bunch of guys shows up with guns
in the middle of the night
trying to take our salt.
What would you have done?
Jericho's continuous acts of
aggression against this town
are unjustifiable.
- What "continuous acts"?
We're neighbors, for God's sake.
I didn't hear much talk of neighbors
when you sent Ravenwood
straight to our door.
We almost blew everything
to hell and gone
trying to defend ourselves
against those mercenaries.
We had no idea where
they were headed next.
You couldn't try and warn us?
You couldn't help us when they were
raiding what little we had left,
shooting whoever got in their way?
My deputies, my friends?
Then I find both of your sons.
Both of them in my factory
trying to destroy the last form
of capital this town's got.
Slow down.
Jake was apprehended yesterday,
attempting to sabotage my factory.
That makes no sense.
The factory's producing wind turbines.
Your sons are pretty
bent on the idea.
I caught Eric the day before
trying to do the same thing.
We're holding both of them.
Now, you listen to me.
I don't care what you think
we've done to you,
but if any harm comes
to either of those boys,
this is not going to end well.
There's been little chance
of this ending well for some time.
I want to see my boys. Now.
What the hell's
taking them so long?
Who are you?
- Don't shoot!
- Who are you?
I'm with Jake.
I'm with Jake.
- Columbus! Columbus!
- What you say?
Jake said if I said Columbus
you'd know he sent me. I was...
I was with him in prison.
He sent me to help you.
He sent me to help you!
Columbus, Columbus.
I got it.
How is Jake doing?
He's okay.
Yeah?
That's Ted.
He's with me.
I'm Maggie.
Jake sent me.
Where are the cops?
They've been dealt with.
You don't want to go in there.
Here, this is everything.
So, what's the plan?
Plan?
There's going to be
an explosion in town.
Hopefully, it'll cause enough chaos
that we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.
I think I can help you do that.
I have an in with Constantino.
Come on. Get up.
What the hell happened?
I didn't tell them anything.
But I already gave them Hawkins.
It's not about Hawkins.
They want to know about Jericho.
What our defenses are like.
Do we have any troops?
Where are they posted?
Do we have a stockpile of weapons?
We have to get back.
We have to warn them.
We will.
We're not going to die in here.
Hey. I'm taking off.
Thanks for all your help.
Yeah. No problem.
You need to get some rest.
I will.
Listen.
I am sorry if I was abrupt earlier.
We're all under a lot of pressure.
Mary's really trying.
Maybe... maybe
you could give her a chance.
Yeah, I know.
It's... it's just being here.
This was April's whole world.
I miss her so much.
I know. It's not fair.
For what it's worth,
you and Mary have a lot in common.
What? We both love Eric?
No. I was actually going to say
you're both pretty tough broads.
You're both... a little hardheaded.
In a bar fight...
even money.
- Everything okay back here?
- Fine.
Thought you were supposed
to stay off your ankle.
Whatever. It's not like I got shot.
I told you, Skylar. It wasn't our fault.
I know. I just
don't understand why now it's okay
for all this random criticism about
my dad to come flying out at me.
What is that?
Especially coming from people
who were supposedly his friends.
I guess they're not his friends.
The Carmichaels used
to come over, like,
every other week for dinner.
We used to go on vacations together.
Why would they do
that if they hated him?
They don't hate him.
They're just scared of him.
My dad was a good person.
He gave them the money
for the clock on Main Street.
He... he did lots of good things.
Maybe he did,
but that's not why
they were nice to him.
They were nice to him because
he had a lot of power.
That's how it works.
We made it to the factory.
You both ready?
We're going to need someone to cover
those guards over there.
Ted, be ready to take them out.
I thought I was driving.
Someone's got to be on those guards
while I get Jake and Eric out.
Cover them until I get back,
and if need be,
take out the sniper first.
5 months ago,
you know what I was doing?
Customizing my truck.
I was getting ready to defend
my dissertation.
Russian lit.
How about you? What were you doing
last time things were normal?
I can't remember back that far.
Is everybody ready?
How will we know when
you're finished over there?
You'll know.
I'll wait here.
Russell, these are not your sons.
You can go on home.
We can fix this.
It doesn't have to end this way.
I get the feeling
it's just getting started.
You can come to Jericho if
you want to. You know that.
I've got family here,
a little girl.
This is our home.
And I keep thinking if I stay here,
maybe we can stop this.
You get in a bad situation, go to
the railroad tracks and go east.
It'll take you to Route 70 and
you can skip the checkpoint.
Thank you, Russell.
Good luck.
We're going to have
to do this another time.
- What?
- My deputy says it isn't a good day.
You can come back tomorrow.
I'm not leaving until
I see my sons, Phil.
I'll tell you what.
You bring back all of my citizens
who were shot in Jericho last night
and I'll give you 15 minutes
with your sons.
You don't want to do this.
Let's go, Mr. Green.
What's this?
We're going to escort you
back to the checkpoint.
Get in the car, please, Mr. Green.
Mortars are good to go.
Get up.
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot!
I'm the one they sent to get
the guy from Jericho!
He tried to kill me.
Please, I need to talk to Constantino
right away, please.
<i>Constantino, I'm just telling you
what he told me.
<i>He's going right now to the factory
to blow it up, and
<i>then he's gonna... he's gonna
blow up the town hall
<i>so that he can get Jake and Eric out.
- You expect me to believe
he wired a government building
under 24-hour armed surveillance?
I'm just telling you what he told me.
I'm trying to help you,
so you'll let me stay as a citizen.
- Please don't lock me in here!
- Do you think I've forgotten
how quickly you turned
on your own friends
when we first brought you in here?
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.
Get him out of here.
What is this?
Come on.
You already know everything.
What do you want from us?
- I already told you everything I know.
- Maybe so,
but maybe your brother'll
be a little more...
more forthcoming
if he thinks it'll save your life.
Let him go!
Let him go!
Move that barricade
and let him through.
- Let him go.
- Tell me.
Let him go!
How many of the roads
out of Jericho are wired?!
- I don't know!
- What you know!
How do you defeat Ravenwood?!
Tell me!
- Tell me right now!
- Eric, look at me!
- Don't tell him anything!
- How many spies have you sent here?!
Tell us what you know
or we slice his throat.
Leave him alone, Perkins!
What was that?
Come on!
There was an explosion at the factory.
- Move them to the warehouse.
- What about the other prisoners?
Just them, now!
Uncuff them.
Come on. Let's go.
Un-handcuff them!
Let's go!
Come on. Move!
Jeez.
Where you going?
To get the... to get the truck.
You were told to wait here
till I got back.
I know.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Everything's going fine.
I can't do this.
I'm sorry, no.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Get up!
- You okay?
- I'm good.
Jake, look out!
Over here!
Everybody go!
Go! Get up!
Come on!
<i>New Arrivals. Potatoes meat
inquire inside for trade.
Thanks, Wayne.
Uh, with the rest in aisle 4.
Can I help you, Mrs. Carmichael?
I heard you've got some meat.
One of Mr. Henderson's
mares broke her leg,
but she was healthy.
I'll take a quarter pound.
This is a pound of grain.
That's not gonna be enough.
But that's what it says.
It says 4 pounds of grain
for a pound of meat.
The price went up.
Sorry.
Please.
It's for Harry.
The doctor said he needs protein.
It's up to you.
My father was a good man,
Mrs. Carmichael.
Yes, he was.
There's a quarter pound.
Thank you.
We're closed!
I just wanted to return this.
- The antiseptic really helped.
- Thank you.
I have a fresh batch.
We'll take it.
So there's no one in town who
wants to have a drink tonight?
You'd think the big draw
would be the atmosphere
and the gracious hospitality,
but turns out,
it's the booze.
They'll be back when
I make more vodka.
Thank you.
How's everything going
down at the center?
Well...
it's calmed down.
We had to break up a lot of fights.
This whole New Bern thing
is making everybody really jumpy.
Talked to Gray.
Said if they're not back by dawn,
then he'd go up there himself.
Then it's gonna be a long night.
You're welcome to stay,
listen to music or...
I think I'll go home and wait there.
If I hear anything...
I'll let you know.
Same here.
Night, Mary.
I didn't think we'd make it this far
with the gas in that tank.
We, uh, we got about 12 miles
to cover, and,
I don't think she's gonna make it.
We have to try.
She didn't leave us.
We're not leaving her.
Here's your knife.
- How's your shoulder?
- Yeah.
Hurts like hell.
It's good.
How you holding up?
I'm still walking.
Yes, you are.
This is real whiskey.
This is actual whiskey.
- I kept a stash just for emergencies.
- I bet you did.
What do you think?
It's no meteor shower, but...
Thanks for coming to get me.
Smell that?
First wheat's going in.
Used to be my favorite time of year.
Listen to that wind.
Still moving, even
after everything we did.
With everything that's coming.
We should go.

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
We're the United States Marines
and we're here to help.
- Lance Corporal Mullen.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.
- Is any of this real?
- The gun's real.
Hands up!
Get 'em up!
You're a smart girl.
You need to get out before
these guys get you killed.
And go where?
Justin, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
The question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?
They get tired of you being sheriff?
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
This thing work?
We get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
Can we buy some more
of these things?
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.
We're gonna need food.
Ten wind turbines
for let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, we'll give you the food.
We're gonna need ten Jericho men
to help us build it.
What you are about to do
means this town's survival.
All right, let's move out.
Anything happens to any of them...
you're the first one I come for.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliceit up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
Come on.
This doesn't look good.
It could turn into a
full-blown riot.
As our guys show up,
you keep them back out of sight.
I don't want those New Bern
guys getting trigger-happy.
This salt mine is
private property!
You have 30 seconds to
get the hell out of here!
What did I tell you, Ted?
Sorry.
I knew it was you.
Yeah, but if it wasn't me...
you just gave up my name.
I want you to tell me
who your friend is
and where I can find him.
Things are gonna get
very bad for you
and your brother,
vxyou don't help us, Jake.
Why would I want to help you?
This is what I know...
is that you, your friend
and your brother
were caught attempting to sabotage
this town's sole means of manufacture.
Manufacturing weapons. You were man...
So I'm gonna
repeat the question:
Where is your friend?
Why don't you tell me what
vvhappened to Heather Lisinski?
Take him back.
Let's go, boy.
Word's gonna get back.
It's gonna get back to Jericho
about what you're doing,
and there's nothing you
can do to stop it!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Looks like they went easy on you.
- Yeah, for now.
They haven't found Hawkins yet.
We're gonna get out of here.
How many people have to die
before you don't care anymore?
April's death was not your fault.
I can't even be sure Heather's dead
with the lies they're spreading.
I've seen, Jake.
I don't think I can go back.
Staying here and getting
yourself killed
isn't going to make you
feel any better, trust me.
Remember the time
I was supposed to...
wake you up for that meteor shower?
Yeah, it was supposed
to be this...
once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Anyway...
you were so pissed at me,
so I finally gave up
and let you sleep.
I'm not giving up this time.
I should arrest you right here!
It's not his fault. We had to deal
with him in New Bern.
Gray, what the hell is this?
There's no deal!
I'm not giving away anything!
Listen, we'll think of something.
Right now we need to stand down.
No, we're not leaving
without our salt.
- It's not worth people getting hurt.
- She's right.
- All right, everybody...
- What are you doing?
Dale, I'm not going to
let people get killed.
- This was your idea.
- This is over!
Get your guys out of here!
Hey! Gray, come on!

How many more are there?
I'm not sure.
Six, maybe seven.
We need gurneys.
What happened?
Some guys from New Bern showed up
trying to steal our salt.
There was a shootout.
Oh, my God!
Okay, Harry...
Harry, we're gonna get you
cleaned up, buddy, okay?
All right, you need me
to look at your arm?
No, it's okay. I can wait.
We shouldn't be patching
those guys up.
We should be arresting them.
They opened fire on us!
We don't know who shot first, all right?
I'll get to an investigation.
Right now we need to make
sure people don't die.
Oh, my God.
Get him to Kenchy... now.
Could we get some ice, please?
She twisted her ankle.
I'm fine.
Hang on.
Hold on, Harry.
Hey, Mrs. Carmichael.
Is he gonna be all right?
No, he's not gonna be all right!
I didn't want this to happen.
Why should we expect
anything different?
As long as you and your boyfriend are
all set, the rest of us can go to hell!
Wouldn't your father be proud?
What is that supposed to mean?
Okay, come on.
She's just nervous.
Caroline, take a look at
her ankle, will ya?
Don't worry about it.
Gail, we heard about the shooting.
I brought the antiseptic
I've been working on.
What can we do to help?
Look, I need charts on
everybody who's checked in.
Annie, show her how to
fill one out, will ya?
- What's all this gonna mean for Eric?
- I don't know.
But haven't we heard anything?
I told you I don't know.
Johnston's working on it.
Now what I could use is a roll
of gauze and some bandages.
They're on the cart
next to the ultrasound.
I just don't know
what that looks like.
Never mind. I'll do it myself.
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?!
You didn't have to bring
rangers in there.
I was protec...
What?!
I'm afraid we've had
our first fatality.
One of your guys
from New Bern...
Dawson.
I didn't get the first name.
Jim Dawson.
You have got to let me
go back to New Bern
and tell them that you support
this salt mine deal.
No, that's not happening.
If they so much as think that
you fired the first shot...
- The who fi... What?
- Come on, Gray.
We need to work together
while we still can.
Things are bad in New Bern.
And when they find out
that six of us came here
and only five are coming back...
What are you saying, Russell?
You got people there.
You should bring 'em home.
Eric's still there.
Johnston, you need
to know something.
vEric hasn't been seen
for a few days.
And yesterday, Jake went
back there to try and find him.
You're telling me this now?
All right, come on. We leave now,
we can get there before dawn.
- No, no, no. I'm not authori...
- Did you hear him?
Constantino wants a bigger fight.
He's not gonna have
my sons as human shields.
Let's go!
Maggie?
Of all the jail cells, right?
Hardly recognize you
without your wardrobe.
What happened?
You guys get caught?
Kind of hard to pull that
voff without the tank.
We...
pretty much split up after Jericho.
I came to New Bern with
a couple of the guys,
but we got turned away at the border
a few weeks ago.
I was dumb enough to try
and sneak back in.
Why? This place is hell.
- It's worse out there.
- Really? That's hard to imagine.
I heard you two got dragged
in front of the Town Hall.
I don't want to scare you, Jake,
but you gotta get out of here.
It isn't exactly easy.
You could do it if you
got someone outside.
Why?
Do you?
Know someone outside?
No.
I'm just trying to help.
Last time you tried to help,
you nearly wiped out
my town's supplies.
- I was trying to survive.
- Yeah, so were we.
Look, I'm not saying it was right.
We had something people
wanted and we used it.
That's how it works.
You think you're helpless in here?
You're not.
Not if you have something they want.
What makes you think
I have something they want?
I don't think they're beating
the two of you up for fun.
Even if I did have something,
I wouldn't give it to them.
You're right. You shouldn't.
But I could.
Yeah, right.
No, thanks.
Listen, if you talk... they're going
to throw you back in your cell.
There's no way they're letting
either of you out of here.
But if I had the information,
I could trade it for my freedom.
And I can go get help.
What... give myself up
to get you out?
So I can get all three of us out.
And you can take me
back to Jericho.
I can't go anywhere without you.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Get up!
Hey, where are you taking him?
He's already told you
everything he knows!
How are things here?
Harry's going to be okay, but...
I'm worried about the staff.
Everybody's exhausted.
You sure you're okay to drive?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Better hit the road.
Be careful.
If I lose all three of you...
I swear to God...
I'm going to bring them home.
You get some sleep.
Got to go.
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?
Jake, just give me a chance, please.
We can end this.
His name is Robert Hawkins.
He said he's probably in a hunting cabin
owned by a guy named Ted Lewis.
He works at the factory.
Find out where it is.
Get over there.
You're supposed to
take me with you.
What?
That's... the deal I made
with Constantino.
I go with you, and as soon as
you see the guy's there,
you drop me off at the checkpoint.
Just talk to Constantino.
This is... he was supposed
to be here!
Take her with you.
If he's not there, kill her.
This is Johnston Green
from Jericho.
- We need talk to the sheriff.
- He's up at the cabin.
We have orders
he's not to be interrupted.
He'll want to be
interrupted for this.
It's not exactly Mayberry, is it?
Not since Ravenwood.
How are you with a rifle?
I hunted jackrabbits before.
Well, I've never shot a person,
if that's what you're asking.
We need to go back to the factory.
We need mortars.
Well, for what?
We can't launch them
over that fence.
We're not going
to launch them from here.
Phil.
Nice spread you got here.
I always wanted you
to see this place.
Well, I just...
wish it were under
better circumstances.
I just found out Eric's been
missing a couple of days.
I'd like a little update on that.
And there was an incident
at the salt mine.
Some of our people got hurt.
Let's take a walk.
<i>I'll go around back.</i>
<i>I got the front.
You watch her.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
You better hope he's home.
This mine deal,
this is your idea?
I thought it could help the town,
create a partnership.
- That didn't quite work out, did it?
- It was...
mishandled all the way around.
We were hoping we could
reach some agreement.
It's a little late for that.
You opened fire on our citizens.
- We don't know who shot first.
- Come on, Phil.
A bunch of guys shows up with guns
in the middle of the night
trying to take our salt.
What would you have done?
Jericho's continuous acts of
aggression against this town
are unjustifiable.
- What "continuous acts"?
We're neighbors, for God's sake.
I didn't hear much talk of neighbors
when you sent Ravenwood
straight to our door.
We almost blew everything
to hell and gone
trying to defend ourselves
against those mercenaries.
We had no idea where
they were headed next.
You couldn't try and warn us?
You couldn't help us when they were
raiding what little we had left,
shooting whoever got in their way?
My deputies, my friends?
Then I find both of your sons.
Both of them in my factory
trying to destroy the last form
of capital this town's got.
Slow down.
Jake was apprehended yesterday,
attempting to sabotage my factory.
That makes no sense.
The factory's producing wind turbines.
Your sons are pretty
bent on the idea.
I caught Eric the day before
trying to do the same thing.
We're holding both of them.
Now, you listen to me.
I don't care what you think
we've done to you,
but if any harm comes
to either of those boys,
this is not going to end well.
There's been little chance
of this ending well for some time.
I want to see my boys. Now.
What the hell's
taking them so long?
Who are you?
- Don't shoot!
- Who are you?
I'm with Jake.
I'm with Jake.
- Columbus! Columbus!
- What you say?
Jake said if I said Columbus
you'd know he sent me. I was...
I was with him in prison.
He sent me to help you.
He sent me to help you!
Columbus, Columbus.
I got it.
How is Jake doing?
He's okay.
Yeah?
That's Ted.
He's with me.
I'm Maggie.
Jake sent me.
Where are the cops?
They've been dealt with.
You don't want to go in there.
Here, this is everything.
So, what's the plan?
Plan?
There's going to be
an explosion in town.
Hopefully, it'll cause enough chaos
that we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.
I think I can help you do that.
I have an in with Constantino.
Come on. Get up.
What the hell happened?
I didn't tell them anything.
But I already gave them Hawkins.
It's not about Hawkins.
They want to know about Jericho.
What our defenses are like.
Do we have any troops?
Where are they posted?
Do we have a stockpile of weapons?
We have to get back.
We have to warn them.
We will.
We're not going to die in here.
Hey. I'm taking off.
Thanks for all your help.
Yeah. No problem.
You need to get some rest.
I will.
Listen.
I am sorry if I was abrupt earlier.
We're all under a lot of pressure.
Mary's really trying.
Maybe... maybe
you could give her a chance.
Yeah, I know.
It's... it's just being here.
This was April's whole world.
I miss her so much.
I know. It's not fair.
For what it's worth,
you and Mary have a lot in common.
What? We both love Eric?
No. I was actually going to say
you're both pretty tough broads.
You're both... a little hardheaded.
In a bar fight...
even money.
- Everything okay back here?
- Fine.
Thought you were supposed
to stay off your ankle.
Whatever. It's not like I got shot.
I told you, Skylar. It wasn't our fault.
I know. I just
don't understand why now it's okay
for all this random criticism about
my dad to come flying out at me.
What is that?
Especially coming from people
who were supposedly his friends.
I guess they're not his friends.
The Carmichaels used
to come over, like,
every other week for dinner.
We used to go on vacations together.
Why would they do
that if they hated him?
They don't hate him.
They're just scared of him.
My dad was a good person.
He gave them the money
for the clock on Main Street.
He... he did lots of good things.
Maybe he did,
but that's not why
they were nice to him.
They were nice to him because
he had a lot of power.
That's how it works.
We made it to the factory.
You both ready?
We're going to need someone to cover
those guards over there.
Ted, be ready to take them out.
I thought I was driving.
Someone's got to be on those guards
while I get Jake and Eric out.
Cover them until I get back,
and if need be,
take out the sniper first.
5 months ago,
you know what I was doing?
Customizing my truck.
I was getting ready to defend
my dissertation.
Russian lit.
How about you? What were you doing
last time things were normal?
I can't remember back that far.
Is everybody ready?
How will we know when
you're finished over there?
You'll know.
I'll wait here.
Russell, these are not your sons.
You can go on home.
We can fix this.
It doesn't have to end this way.
I get the feeling
it's just getting started.
You can come to Jericho if
you want to. You know that.
I've got family here,
a little girl.
This is our home.
And I keep thinking if I stay here,
maybe we can stop this.
You get in a bad situation, go to
the railroad tracks and go east.
It'll take you to Route 70 and
you can skip the checkpoint.
Thank you, Russell.
Good luck.
We're going to have
to do this another time.
- What?
- My deputy says it isn't a good day.
You can come back tomorrow.
I'm not leaving until
I see my sons, Phil.
I'll tell you what.
You bring back all of my citizens
who were shot in Jericho last night
and I'll give you 15 minutes
with your sons.
You don't want to do this.
Let's go, Mr. Green.
What's this?
We're going to escort you
back to the checkpoint.
Get in the car, please, Mr. Green.
Mortars are good to go.
Get up.
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot!
I'm the one they sent to get
the guy from Jericho!
He tried to kill me.
Please, I need to talk to Constantino
right away, please.
<i>Constantino, I'm just telling you
what he told me.
<i>He's going right now to the factory
to blow it up, and
<i>then he's gonna... he's gonna
blow up the town hall
<i>so that he can get Jake and Eric out.
- You expect me to believe
he wired a government building
under 24-hour armed surveillance?
I'm just telling you what he told me.
I'm trying to help you,
so you'll let me stay as a citizen.
- Please don't lock me in here!
- Do you think I've forgotten
how quickly you turned
on your own friends
when we first brought you in here?
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.
Get him out of here.
What is this?
Come on.
You already know everything.
What do you want from us?
- I already told you everything I know.
- Maybe so,
but maybe your brother'll
be a little more...
more forthcoming
if he thinks it'll save your life.
Let him go!
Let him go!
Move that barricade
and let him through.
- Let him go.
- Tell me.
Let him go!
How many of the roads
out of Jericho are wired?!
- I don't know!
- What you know!
How do you defeat Ravenwood?!
Tell me!
- Tell me right now!
- Eric, look at me!
- Don't tell him anything!
- How many spies have you sent here?!
Tell us what you know
or we slice his throat.
Leave him alone, Perkins!
What was that?
Come on!
There was an explosion at the factory.
- Move them to the warehouse.
- What about the other prisoners?
Just them, now!
Uncuff them.
Come on. Let's go.
Un-handcuff them!
Let's go!
Come on. Move!
Jeez.
Where you going?
To get the... to get the truck.
You were told to wait here
till I got back.
I know.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Everything's going fine.
I can't do this.
I'm sorry, no.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Get up!
- You okay?
- I'm good.
Jake, look out!
Over here!
Everybody go!
Go! Get up!
Come on!
<i>New Arrivals. Potatoes meat
inquire inside for trade.
Thanks, Wayne.
Uh, with the rest in aisle 4.
Can I help you, Mrs. Carmichael?
I heard you've got some meat.
One of Mr. Henderson's
mares broke her leg,
but she was healthy.
I'll take a quarter pound.
This is a pound of grain.
That's not gonna be enough.
But that's what it says.
It says 4 pounds of grain
for a pound of meat.
The price went up.
Sorry.
Please.
It's for Harry.
The doctor said he needs protein.
It's up to you.
My father was a good man,
Mrs. Carmichael.
Yes, he was.
There's a quarter pound.
Thank you.
We're closed!
I just wanted to return this.
- The antiseptic really helped.
- Thank you.
I have a fresh batch.
We'll take it.
So there's no one in town who
wants to have a drink tonight?
You'd think the big draw

- Yeah.
Hurts like hell.
It's good.
How you holding up?
I'm still walking.
Yes, you are.

and your brother,
vxyou don't help us, Jake.
Why would I want to help you?
This is what I know...
is that you, your friend
and your brother
were caught attempting to sabotage
this town's sole means of manufacture.
Manufacturing weapons. You were man...
So I'm gonna
repeat the question:
Where is your friend?
Why don't you tell me what
vvhappened to Heather Lisinski?
Take him back.
Let's go, boy.
Word's gonna get back.
It's gonna get back to Jericho
about what you're doing,
and there's nothing you
can do to stop it!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Looks like they went easy on you.
- Yeah, for now.
They haven't found Hawkins yet.
We're gonna get out of here.
How many people have to die
before you don't care anymore?
April's death was not your fault.
I can't even be sure Heather's dead
with the lies they're spreading.
I've seen, Jake.
I don't think I can go back.
Staying here and getting
yourself killed
isn't going to make you
feel any better, trust me.
Remember the time
I was supposed to...
wake you up for that meteor shower?
Yeah, it was supposed
to be this...
once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Anyway...
you were so pissed at me,
so I finally gave up
and let you sleep.
I'm not giving up this time.
I should arrest you right here!
It's not his fault. We had to deal
with him in New Bern.
Gray, what the hell is this?
There's no deal!
I'm not giving away anything!
Listen, we'll think of something.
Right now we need to stand down.
No, we're not leaving
without our salt.
- It's not worth people getting hurt.
- She's right.
- All right, everybody...
- What are you doing?
Dale, I'm not going to
let people get killed.
- This was your idea.
- This is over!
Get your guys out of here!
Hey! Gray, come on!

How many more are there?
I'm not sure.
Six, maybe seven.
We need gurneys.
What happened?
Some guys from New Bern showed up
trying to steal our salt.
There was a shootout.
Oh, my God!
Okay, Harry...
Harry, we're gonna get you
cleaned up, buddy, okay?
All right, you need me
to look at your arm?
No, it's okay. I can wait.
We shouldn't be patching
those guys up.
We should be arresting them.
They opened fire on us!
We don't know who shot first, all right?
I'll get to an investigation.
Right now we need to make
sure people don't die.
Oh, my God.
Get him to Kenchy... now.
Could we get some ice, please?
She twisted her ankle.
I'm fine.
Hang on.
Hold on, Harry.
Hey, Mrs. Carmichael.
Is he gonna be all right?
No, he's not gonna be all right!
I didn't want this to happen.
Why should we expect
anything different?
As long as you and your boyfriend are
all set, the rest of us can go to hell!
Wouldn't your father be proud?
What is that supposed to mean?
Okay, come on.
She's just nervous.
Caroline, take a look at
her ankle, will ya?
Don't worry about it.
Gail, we heard about the shooting.
I brought the antiseptic
I've been working on.
What can we do to help?
Look, I need charts on
everybody who's checked in.
Annie, show her how to
fill one out, will ya?
- What's all this gonna mean for Eric?
- I don't know.
But haven't we heard anything?
I told you I don't know.
Johnston's working on it.
Now what I could use is a roll
of gauze and some bandages.
They're on the cart
next to the ultrasound.
I just don't know
what that looks like.
Never mind. I'll do it myself.
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?!
You didn't have to bring
rangers in there.
I was protec...
What?!
I'm afraid we've had
our first fatality.
One of your guys
from New Bern...
Dawson.
I didn't get the first name.
Jim Dawson.
You have got to let me
go back to New Bern
and tell them that you support
this salt mine deal.
No, that's not happening.
If they so much as think that
you fired the first shot...
- The who fi... What?
- Come on, Gray.
We need to work together
while we still can.
Things are bad in New Bern.
And when they find out
that six of us came here
and only five are coming back...
What are you saying, Russell?
You got people there.
You should bring 'em home.
Eric's still there.
Johnston, you need
to know something.
vEric hasn't been seen
for a few days.
And yesterday, Jake went
back there to try and find him.
You're telling me this now?
All right, come on. We leave now,
we can get there before dawn.
- No, no, no. I'm not authori...
- Did you hear him?
Constantino wants a bigger fight.
He's not gonna have
my sons as human shields.
Let's go!
Maggie?
Of all the jail cells, right?
Hardly recognize you
without your wardrobe.
What happened?
You guys get caught?
Kind of hard to pull that
voff without the tank.
We...
pretty much split up after Jericho.
I came to New Bern with
a couple of the guys,
but we got turned away at the border
a few weeks ago.
I was dumb enough to try
and sneak back in.
Why? This place is hell.
- It's worse out there.
- Really? That's hard to imagine.
I heard you two got dragged
in front of the Town Hall.
I don't want to scare you, Jake,
but you gotta get out of here.
It isn't exactly easy.
You could do it if you
got someone outside.
Why?
Do you?
Know someone outside?
No.
I'm just trying to help.
Last time you tried to help,
you nearly wiped out
my town's supplies.
- I was trying to survive.
- Yeah, so were we.
Look, I'm not saying it was right.
We had something people
wanted and we used it.
That's how it works.
You think you're helpless in here?
You're not.
Not if you have something they want.
What makes you think
I have something they want?
I don't think they're beating
the two of you up for fun.
Even if I did have something,
I wouldn't give it to them.
You're right. You shouldn't.
But I could.
Yeah, right.
No, thanks.
Listen, if you talk... they're going
to throw you back in your cell.
There's no way they're letting
either of you out of here.
But if I had the information,
I could trade it for my freedom.
And I can go get help.
What... give myself up
to get you out?
So I can get all three of us out.
And you can take me
back to Jericho.
I can't go anywhere without you.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Get up!
Hey, where are you taking him?
He's already told you
everything he knows!
How are things here?
Harry's going to be okay, but...
I'm worried about the staff.
Everybody's exhausted.
You sure you're okay to drive?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Better hit the road.
Be careful.
If I lose all three of you...
I swear to God...
I'm going to bring them home.
You get some sleep.
Got to go.
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?
Jake, just give me a chance, please.
We can end this.
His name is Robert Hawkins.
He said he's probably in a hunting cabin
owned by a guy named Ted Lewis.
He works at the factory.
Find out where it is.
Get over there.
You're supposed to
take me with you.
What?
That's... the deal I made
with Constantino.
I go with you, and as soon as
you see the guy's there,
you drop me off at the checkpoint.
Just talk to Constantino.
This is... he was supposed
to be here!
Take her with you.
If he's not there, kill her.
This is Johnston Green
from Jericho.
- We need talk to the sheriff.
- He's up at the cabin.
We have orders
he's not to be interrupted.
He'll want to be
interrupted for this.
It's not exactly Mayberry, is it?
Not since Ravenwood.
How are you with a rifle?
I hunted jackrabbits before.
Well, I've never shot a person,
if that's what you're asking.
We need to go back to the factory.
We need mortars.
Well, for what?
We can't launch them
over that fence.
We're not going
to launch them from here.
Phil.
Nice spread you got here.
I always wanted you
to see this place.
Well, I just...
wish it were under
better circumstances.
I just found out Eric's been
missing a couple of days.
I'd like a little update on that.
And there was an incident
at the salt mine.
Some of our people got hurt.
Let's take a walk.
<i>I'll go around back.</i>
<i>I got the front.
You watch her.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
You better hope he's home.
This mine deal,
this is your idea?
I thought it could help the town,
create a partnership.
- That didn't quite work out, did it?
- It was...
mishandled all the way around.
We were hoping we could
reach some agreement.
It's a little late for that.
You opened fire on our citizens.
- We don't know who shot first.
- Come on, Phil.
A bunch of guys shows up with guns
in the middle of the night
trying to take our salt.
What would you have done?
Jericho's continuous acts of
aggression against this town
are unjustifiable.
- What "continuous acts"?
We're neighbors, for God's sake.
I didn't hear much talk of neighbors
when you sent Ravenwood
straight to our door.
We almost blew everything
to hell and gone
trying to defend ourselves
against those mercenaries.
We had no idea where
they were headed next.
You couldn't try and warn us?
You couldn't help us when they were
raiding what little we had left,
shooting whoever got in their way?
My deputies, my friends?
Then I find both of your sons.
Both of them in my factory
trying to destroy the last form
of capital this town's got.
Slow down.
Jake was apprehended yesterday,
attempting to sabotage my factory.
That makes no sense.
The factory's producing wind turbines.
Your sons are pretty
bent on the idea.
I caught Eric the day before
trying to do the same thing.
We're holding both of them.
Now, you listen to me.
I don't care what you think
we've done to you,
but if any harm comes
to either of those boys,
this is not going to end well.
There's been little chance
of this ending well for some time.
I want to see my boys. Now.
What the hell's
taking them so long?
Who are you?
- Don't shoot!
- Who are you?
I'm with Jake.
I'm with Jake.
- Columbus! Columbus!
- What you say?
Jake said if I said Columbus
you'd know he sent me. I was...
I was with him in prison.
He sent me to help you.
He sent me to help you!
Columbus, Columbus.
I got it.
How is Jake doing?
He's okay.
Yeah?
That's Ted.
He's with me.
I'm Maggie.
Jake sent me.
Where are the cops?
They've been dealt with.
You don't want to go in there.
Here, this is everything.
So, what's the plan?
Plan?
There's going to be
an explosion in town.
Hopefully, it'll cause enough chaos
that we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.
I think I can help you do that.
I have an in with Constantino.
Come on. Get up.
What the hell happened?
I didn't tell them anything.
But I already gave them Hawkins.
It's not about Hawkins.
They want to know about Jericho.
What our defenses are like.
Do we have any troops?
Where are they posted?
Do we have a stockpile of weapons?
We have to get back.
We have to warn them.
We will.
We're not going to die in here.
Hey. I'm taking off.
Thanks for all your help.
Yeah. No problem.
You need to get some rest.
I will.
Listen.
I am sorry if I was abrupt earlier.
We're all under a lot of pressure.
Mary's really trying.
Maybe... maybe
you could give her a chance.
Yeah, I know.
It's... it's just being here.
This was April's whole world.
I miss her so much.
I know. It's not fair.
For what it's worth,
you and Mary have a lot in common.
What? We both love Eric?
No. I was actually going to say
you're both pretty tough broads.
You're both... a little hardheaded.
In a bar fight...
even money.
- Everything okay back here?
- Fine.
Thought you were supposed
to stay off your ankle.
Whatever. It's not like I got shot.
I told you, Skylar. It wasn't our fault.
I know. I just
don't understand why now it's okay
for all this random criticism about
my dad to come flying out at me.
What is that?
Especially coming from people
who were supposedly his friends.
I guess they're not his friends.
The Carmichaels used
to come over, like,
every other week for dinner.
We used to go on vacations together.
Why would they do
that if they hated him?
They don't hate him.
They're just scared of him.
My dad was a good person.
He gave them the money
for the clock on Main Street.
He... he did lots of good things.
Maybe he did,
but that's not why
they were nice to him.
They were nice to him because
he had a lot of power.
That's how it works.
We made it to the factory.
You both ready?
We're going to need someone to cover
those guards over there.
Ted, be ready to take them out.
I thought I was driving.
Someone's got to be on those guards
while I get Jake and Eric out.
Cover them until I get back,
and if need be,
take out the sniper first.
5 months ago,
you know what I was doing?
Customizing my truck.
I was getting ready to defend
my dissertation.
Russian lit.
How about you? What were you doing
last time things were normal?
I can't remember back that far.
Is everybody ready?
How will we know when
you're finished over there?
You'll know.
I'll wait here.
Russell, these are not your sons.
You can go on home.
We can fix this.
It doesn't have to end this way.
I get the feeling
it's just getting started.
You can come to Jericho if
you want to. You know that.
I've got family here,
a little girl.
This is our home.
And I keep thinking if I stay here,
maybe we can stop this.
You get in a bad situation, go to
the railroad tracks and go east.
It'll take you to Route 70 and
you can skip the checkpoint.
Thank you, Russell.
Good luck.
We're going to have
to do this another time.
- What?
- My deputy says it isn't a good day.
You can come back tomorrow.
I'm not leaving until
I see my sons, Phil.
I'll tell you what.
You bring back all of my citizens
who were shot in Jericho last night
and I'll give you 15 minutes
with your sons.
You don't want to do this.
Let's go, Mr. Green.
What's this?
We're going to escort you
back to the checkpoint.
Get in the car, please, Mr. Green.
Mortars are good to go.
Get up.
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot!
I'm the one they sent to get
the guy from Jericho!
He tried to kill me.
Please, I need to talk to Constantino
right away, please.
<i>Constantino, I'm just telling you
what he told me.
<i>He's going right now to the factory
to blow it up, and
<i>then he's gonna... he's gonna
blow up the town hall
<i>so that he can get Jake and Eric out.
- You expect me to believe
he wired a government building
under 24-hour armed surveillance?
I'm just telling you what he told me.
I'm trying to help you,
so you'll let me stay as a citizen.
- Please don't lock me in here!
- Do you think I've forgotten
how quickly you turned
on your own friends
when we first brought you in here?
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.
Get him out of here.
What is this?
Come on.
You already know everything.
What do you want from us?
- I already told you everything I know.
- Maybe so,
but maybe your brother'll
be a little more...
more forthcoming
if he thinks it'll save your life.
Let him go!
Let him go!
Move that barricade
and let him through.
- Let him go.
- Tell me.
Let him go!
How many of the roads
out of Jericho are wired?!
- I don't know!
- What you know!
How do you defeat Ravenwood?!
Tell me!
- Tell me right now!
- Eric, look at me!
- Don't tell him anything!
- How many spies have you sent here?!
Tell us what you know
or we slice his throat.
Leave him alone, Perkins!
What was that?
Come on!
There was an explosion at the factory.
- Move them to the warehouse.
- What about the other prisoners?
Just them, now!
Uncuff them.
Come on. Let's go.
Un-handcuff them!
Let's go!
Come on. Move!
Jeez.
Where you going?
To get the... to get the truck.
You were told to wait here
till I got back.
I know.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Everything's going fine.
I can't do this.
I'm sorry, no.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Get up!
- You okay?
- I'm good.
Jake, look out!
Over here!
Everybody go!
Go! Get up!
Come on!
<i>New Arrivals. Potatoes meat
inquire inside for trade.
Thanks, Wayne.
Uh, with the rest in aisle 4.
Can I help you, Mrs. Carmichael?
I heard you've got some meat.
One of Mr. Henderson's
mares broke her leg,
but she was healthy.
I'll take a quarter pound.
This is a pound of grain.
That's not gonna be enough.
But that's what it says.
It says 4 pounds of grain
for a pound of meat.
The price went up.
Sorry.
Please.
It's for Harry.
The doctor said he needs protein.
It's up to you.
My father was a good man,
Mrs. Carmichael.
Yes, he was.
There's a quarter pound.
Thank you.
We're closed!
I just wanted to return this.
- The antiseptic really helped.
- Thank you.
I have a fresh batch.
We'll take it.
So there's no one in town who
wants to have a drink tonight?
You'd think the big draw
would be the atmosphere
and the gracious hospitality,
but turns out,
it's the booze.
They'll be back when
I make more vodka.
Thank you.
How's everything going
down at the center?
Well...
it's calmed down.
We had to break up a lot of fights.
This whole New Bern thing
is making everybody really jumpy.
Talked to Gray.
Said if they're not back by dawn,
then he'd go up there himself.
Then it's gonna be a long night.
You're welcome to stay,
listen to music or...
I think I'll go home and wait there.
If I hear anything...
I'll let you know.
Same here.
Night, Mary.
I didn't think we'd make it this far
with the gas in that tank.
We, uh, we got about 12 miles
to cover, and,
I don't think she's gonna make it.
We have to try.
She didn't leave us.
We're not leaving her.
Here's your knife.
- How's your shoulder?
- Yeah.
Hurts like hell.
It's good.
How you holding up?
I'm still walking.
Yes, you are.
This is real whiskey.
This is actual whiskey.
- I kept a stash just for emergencies.
- I bet you did.
What do you think?
It's no meteor shower, but...
Thanks for coming to get me.
Smell that?
First wheat's going in.
Used to be my favorite time of year.
Listen to that wind.
Still moving, even
after everything we did.
With everything that's coming.
We should go.

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Hello, Jonah.
Guy did four years at Lansing
for extortion and assault.
Why are you talking to him?
It's okay, all right?
It didn't have anything to do with you.
He's my father...
it has everything to do with me.
Jonah agrees to leave town
and not come back.
Exile.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No, the question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?
No, I m still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
All right, let's get it up
as fast as we can.
Can we bust some more
of these things?
You got one of the only salt mines
around for 400 miles.
We're going to need food.
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, look, we'll give you the food.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.
You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliced it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
There was going to be
an explosion in town.
Hopefully, we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.
Everybody, go!
All right, keep alert.
Jake said the New Bern guys
might be coming right behind them.
Maybe they're already here.
What is that?
What happened?
We got a major problem, Gray.
Where's Eric?
He's fine.
He's at the med center.
Well, is it about the mine?
It's a lot worse than that.
Who are you?
Stop moving.
You hear me?
I'm talking to you.
Freeze!
Who are you?
I think we killed...
six in New Bern.
I counted eight.
Who's this?
Says he's from New Bern.
Wanted to talk to you.
What is this about?
<i>Am I speaking to Gray Anderson?
<i>This is Phil Constantino.
<i>Henry, you can
come home now, son.
<i>We're still cleaning the blood
of eight deputies
<i>off the sidewalks of New Bern,
<i>so you need to understand
our position.
<i>We need seven farms,
<i>including the Jackson farm,
<i>the Herbert farm,
<i>and the Richmond farm.
And we need half the salt mine.
You have four hours to respond.
I don't understand.
What are you asking us to do?
Jericho is about to be invaded.
For the sake of your people,
I'm asking you...
to surrender.

We have border patrol on duty
at all the checkpoints
and all the new roadblocks,
but we're scrambling
to cover everywhere else.
- Did you see anything out there?
- No, nothing.
What is he actually going to do?
Just march in here and
start shooting us?
We were high school football rivals
five months ago.
They tortured my brother to find out
how many troops we have, what weapons.
They have made hundreds of mortars.
My guess says they can hit
from as far as...
two miles out.
Having them and using them on people
are two different things.
That's what they said
about nuclear bombs.
How much time left?
50 minutes.
<i>Haven't been able to get a pulse
from this baby for an hour.
<i>Respiration is 16, pulse is 84.
<i>Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.
Just hold the pressure.
Put pressure right there,
right there.
Press.
Harder. Damn it!
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?
- I am trying to save April.
-<i> The baby's heart has stopped.
- What do you mean it's stopped?
- Do something.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's get you fixed up, okay?
Come on, sweetheart.
We're not going to give anything
to these people.
Mrs. Herbert?
I just wanted to offer the town
a solution.
You cannot give away that farm.
Gray said it's too far out of town
for the rangers to help.
I can't stand out there with a rifle.
- Then I'll defend it.
- Really?
Are you abandoning it?
The bank owns half of that farm anyway.
You just...
do whatever you want, Dale.
Wait, let's be clear.
If I defend it, then it's all mine.
If you can defend it.
Dale, how are we going
to defend that farm?
Get me every refugee you can find.
All right.
Careful.
I was so scared.
When you didn't come back, I thought...
I'm back.
Oh, God!
I'm sorry.
I don't want to hurt you.
I'm okay.
Listen up! Guys!
They said you had some food here.
Yeah... I do have food.
As of this morning, I own
the second biggest farm in Jericho.
Now...
I'm going to need men to defend it
if we're invaded.
What do we get?
The promise of three meals a day.
You want us to risk our lives
for a promise?
No way.
Guys, listen, listen!
Since you've been here, you've been
asking for a place to live, food.
You came here as refugees,
and you're still being treated
like second-class citizens.
That's no way to live.
If you fight for my farm and we win,
then everybody gets an equal split
It'll be your farm.
You'll have a stake in this town
that nobody can take away from you.
You'll never have to ask anyone
for anything ever again.
So...
who wants a future?
Constantin said four hours.
It's already been four hours.
You okay?
Come here.
What do we hear from the rangers?
Runners came in.
They haven't seen anything.
Should we call Constantino?
I don't have anything to tell him.
And I'm not just going
to give the town away.
There's something I need to tell you.
It's crazy. Everybody's saying
that New Bern's going to attack us.
We don't know. Look...
Something happened to Heather.
She found out New Bern
was building mortars.
She tried to stop them and they...
they caught her.
Nobody's seen her since.
- What did they do to her?
- I don't know.
Is she dead?
Jake, is she dead?
Get away from the windows!
Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?
- I'm good. I'm good.
Wait here.
Are you okay?
Somebody help!
Mom.
Mom!
Cover your eyes!
Jake, you okay?
Honey?
- Mom.
- Sweetheart, look at me.
- Look at me.
- I can't hear.
I know, sweetie.
That'll come back.
- We're right here, Mom.
- What's happening?
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be fine.
Let's get you to the med center,
honey.
Come on.
Get everybody off the street.
There might be more coming.
We got to open the shelters
and the town hall
and the medical center...
Move!
Constantino.
He's on the radio.
Constantino, you son of a bitch,
what the hell are you doing?
<i>I'm sorry for your troubles.
We got a dozen injured people
on the street here.
<i>I warned you what would happen
if you didn't meet our demands.
Demands?
I will make it my,
my purpose in life
to see that you are held accountable
for what you've just done.
<i>Take another hour...
Do not fire any more
of those things in here!
<i>One hour, Gray.
<i>We need seven farms.
<i>It was just two mortars this time.
<i>Next time there'll be three.
Try to retaliate,
or refuse our demands,
we'll send more.
We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.
The patrols said that it looked like
they were fired from the west.
Get as many rangers as you can,
all right, go out there,
find those mortars.
And we are gonna take them out!
Move!
Come on.
- Darcy, are you okay ?
- Yeah, but what happened ?
It's New Bern.
They're firing mortars at us.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!
Look, we've got to get the kids
and you got to get out of here.
Where are we going to go?
There's a safe house I know of.
If we could just get there.
It's in Montana.
Go to Montana on these roads?
What are our chances
of getting there?
I don't know.
- You heard from Constantino?
- No, no, but I...
sent out a squad of rangers
to try to take out the mortars.
I should have been with them.
You weren't here,
and I couldn't wait.
What should we do?
I don't know.
We've got to get underground, now.
Everybody!
You have got to get underground.
You, get everybody underground.
Let's go home.
Let's go home.
Okay.
I have to get back to town.
Sam, get away fromhere.
Dad, there's more water in the garage.
You want me to get it?
That is the safest room
in the house.
It's concrete, rebar, reinforced.
That's where we should be, D.
Come on.
Come on in.
This is cool!
Sam, Allison, go in the other room.
- Why can't...
- Come on, Sam. Let's go.
But this room's boring.
No more secrets.
Those mortars didn't come
from very far off.
- How much time do we have?
- About four minutes left.
<i>This is Stanley Richmond.
Mayor Anderson, can you hear me?
- We hear you.
- <i>Okay,
<i>we're about 100 yards away
from the mortar cannons.
<i>There's two of them,
sitting on the back of a flatbed truck.
Where are you, Stanley?
<i>We're in the woods
by the old </i>Shaw Creek Bridge,
<i>about two miles west of town.
<i>There's out ten men
guarding the truck.
- <i>They're arked in a clearing.</i>
- Can you get to them?
<i>Yeah, I think so. There's a path
leading into the clearing.
Tell him he's got to send scouts out
on both flanks.
There's no time to reposition.
They have to know
what they're going into.
I'm not gonna give them
another chance to drop bombs on us.
Gray, these men are not soldiers...
Johnston, you can stay or you can go,
but how this happens is my call.
- Stanley, get out of there. Don't do!
- Let go!
<i>What should we do?
Take 'em out.
<i>Got it.
So why now?
You know I always thought
that I could keep you safe.
But now, uh, today...
I'm just not so sure.
Nothing is safe.
Not anymore.
But, you know, in...
in the middle of all of this...
in this madness...
the only thing that make sense to me,
I mean really, the...
only thing...
is you and the kids.
It took me a while to realize
that and I'm...
sorry.
I am...
so sorry.
I missed you.
I missed you.
How do we know if it worked?
Come on.
Is he shot?
Sit down. Sit down.
Get him to the med center.
Is he all right?
Are you shot?
Where's everybody else?
Stanley, what happened out there?
I don't know.
We were moving
towards the mortar truck
and they were waiting,
they were waiting
on both sides of it for us.
They wouldn't...
they wouldn't stop firing.
Stanley, where's everybody else?
Where are they, son?
They're...
they're all dead.
They're all dead.
This is insane.
This is insane!
You son of a bitch!
Back off. Hold on.
Hold on.
Bailey's... now.
Stanley said the mortars were
on trucks here,
right here, just east
of Shaw Creek Bridge.
They're going to fire and move.
Check the tracks, see which
direction they were headed.
And Jake, just scout them.
We're not not going to do
anything else half-cocked.
First, we find 'em, then
we'll formulate a plan of attack.
Got it.
Just scout 'em.
I'm coming with you.
It was not a request.
All right.
From the tracks, I'd say three,
maybe four trucks
headed down that fire road.
They could hit the town from anywhere
once they get to Route 6.
Hawkins spotted a five-ton truck
coming this way from New Bern
about three miles back
Could be a supply truck
heading to the next mortar site.
We can get it.
All right. Let's go.
Stop the truck now!
Stop it!
They're all right.
Let 'em go.
You two finally turned to
a life of crime.
We're going to need
your men, Dale.
My men don't fight for
Gray Anderson.
We're asking you
to help defend the town.
We lose, you don't have anything.
If we fight with you,
we keep Mrs. Herbert's farm.
And we get the abandoned
Surrey farm also.
You already own half a salt mine,
and a percentage of every farm
in the county. Now you want more?
- It's just business.
- This isn't about business.
I'm asking you to do this for me.
We need your help.
Let's get ready to move.
They'll be looking for this truck.
Last time I was in town,
those people were trying to lynch me.
They can all go to hell.
Just listen to me.
No, you listen to me.
I've been watching New Bern
moving weapons
and supplies around here
for the last three days.
This is going to be a bloodbath.
The best thing you can do
is come with me.
Jericho's my home.
And I'm your father.
It's survival of the fastest
and strongest out here.
You think I'm safer with you,
robbing trucks?
I haven't lost a man yet.
And if New Bern doesn't get Jericho,
somebody else will.
Come with me.
Give us the maps,
help us take out the mortars,
help us fight.
We'll give you half.
Half of all weapons,
food and fuel that we take.
And if New Bern's army's as
big as you say it is,
you'll do whole lot better than
hitting one truck at a time out here.
You got more of me in you
than you're ever going to admit.
Change of plans!
When the federal government
comes back, we have our deeds.
We get our farms back then.
What if the government
doesn't come back?
What if this is the way it stays?
But they are coming here
intent on killing us.
Gray says we're only
three farms away from a deal.
And besides,
we're not prepared to fight.
I will get us prepared.
You talk to those farmers,
you don't let them give in.
Who else you got willing
to fight, Johnston?
The cops?
The rangers?
Dad?
There are 11 potential mortar sites.
Question is, which one is next?
Driver said... this one.
If we can trust him.
How were the trucks guarded?
- They have men hidden in the brush.
- I'm not sure I'm taking your deal.
They have nearly 30 guys guarding
that mortar truck.
I see nine here.
Gray's got the seven farmers he needs.
He's going to call New Bern
and give them up.
Surrenders those farms,
New Bern will occupy them in 30 minutes.
We'll never get rid of them.
So, what do we do?
I guess I'm about to make
a deal with the devil.
You flatter me.
get back over to town hall,
do whatever it takes,
but don't let Gray make that call.
What do you mean, do whatever
it takes? What are you saying?
I'm saying it's time to pick a side.
Why'd you bring Grey in here?
They just want to talk
to you for a second.
Don't make that deal
with Constantino.
It's not a debate.
If you make this deal, they're not
going to stop with seven farms.
People are going to starve
to death, Gray.
And that's if they don't kill us
outright when the food gets scarce.
I need you to leave.
- Now!
- Come on, Gray.
Why are you so ready to give up?
I almost gave my life
for this town, Gray.
You better listen to me,
you understand?
- It wasn't your fault those men died.
- Get 'em out of here!
Get them out of here!
You're going to listen
to what I have to say.
It's not your fault.
Calm down!
Put 'em down!
Put 'em down!
We have men out there, Gray.
What?
We have men out there.
Put 'em down!
- Brooks, put 'em down!
- You, too. Put 'em down..
Who is out there ?
Who is out there and
what are they doing?
Jake, Hawkins, my dad.
And they're going to try
and take out the mortars.
The three of them?
What do they think they're going to do?
You cannot give up those farms.
- Do you understand?
- We can't fight!
We can't fight.
You saw what happened this morning.
We're not ready for this.
I have been talking to Constantino,
and I promised him that
we will not retaliate
if he just gives us time
to put this deal together.
We've got maps of all
of New Bern's positions.
- Supply line, everything.
- Where did you get this stuff?
We've got trucks. We've got fuel.
We've got guns.
What are you talking about?
Where did you get all this?
Jonah Prowse is fighting with us.
He's got about 30 men
fighting with him. 30 men!
Well, they can get us all killed.
<i>This is New Bern. Over.
Don't go near that radio, Gray.
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?
Johnston Green, right?
Two years ago,  you came over
to New Bern and finished fourth
in a bass fishing contest
up at Big Hill Lake.
I finished second.
Let's go.
<i>Mayor Anderson,
your time is running out.
She tried to tell Constantino
that I did not send them out there.
Gray, don't make that deal.
Buy some time to take out those mortars.
Negotiate with Constantino.
So, we pop out of here,
it gets bad, Jonah going
will have our backs, right?
You are filling me
with confidence, Jake.
Emily's with him.
He'll be there.
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here, Phil.
<i>What's your decision?
You're a good businessman, Gray.
You know how to do it.
Well, we don't want to fight.
So,
what about the... Levine
and Hides Dairy farms,
in-instead of the Richmond farm?
<i>That's less acreage.
Yeah, I know, but...
then you would have a dairy
and a soybean farm,
and also Hides has 50 acres of corn,
and I got to tell you, that deal would
be a lot easier to sell to my people.
Where you been?
Supposed to be here three hours ago.
I got sniped at by
a gang over near Calvert.
Had to come all the way back around
through... back through Van Ness.
Got a half a barbecued venison in back.
You're kidding?
God, we need it.
We got chow!
We'll eat in shifts.
Don't pull everybody off
the perimeter at the same time.
Don't move.
And drop your weapons.
Get in the truck.
Move!
<i>My people are telling me
that all the cattle out
<i>at Hides farm have been
slaughtered for food.
Really?
I don't think so, but
I can find out for you.
Let's talk about the salt mine now.
You've already got 25% of the mine.
Can't we just leave it at that?
<i>What are you doing, Gray?
What are you talking about?
<i>This negotiation is over.
No, Phil, come on.
<i>30 seconds, Gray,
or I send more mortars.
We almost have a deal here, Phil.
Come on!
They're here!
They're in the camp!
I'm closing the camp!
Come on. Get up there!
Where the hell is Jonah?
He doesn't want to get hit
in our crossfire.
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Stop!
This one's yours.
Meet you back at the camp.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
Deal's changed.
The hell it has.
It's a new split:
I get all the weapons, the food,
the fuel, the guns, everything.
- Deal's 50-50.
- And what do we get?
You get to have bombs
not falling on your head.
Listen here, Jonah...
This is about to get a lot worse.
We need those guns!
Why are you doing this?
You owe me a lot more than that!
I am a thief, not a soldier.
You promised you'd help us.
Look, you shouldn't be near me.
You're a schoolteacher, kid.
A schoolteacher.
Go on.
We're just gonna let him go?
We need those guns.
Guns.
Guns are easy.
You had this the whole time
and you didn't say anything?
I never thought I was gonna call
this town my home.
Let's get them loaded up.
What's he doing?
Why hasn't he fired the mortars?
Did we take them out?
He would have come back
on the radio.
We took out the mortars.
Hell, yeah.
<i>Are you there?
<i>Now, you've brought this on yourself.
<i>There's no deals, no mercy.
<i>We're coming.
<i>This means war.
<i>Do you hear me, Gray?
I need your help.
Stanley, get me every
runner you can find.
I want to get orders out
to all the patrols.
Most of you have no idea what to do
or what's coming.
Some of you do.
This isn't a fight about land
or about this town.
This is a fight for our very existence.
Pray for each other.
While you're at it, pray for the men
and women of New Bern.
Pray that God forgives us.
Every able-bodied person...
who needs a gun...
16 years of age or older...
line up.

<i>Previously on </i>Jericho
Oh, my God... Ted !
We grew up together over in New Bern.
- You just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No. The question is, how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
They get tired of you being sheriff?
<i>Can we buy some more of these things?
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, we'll give you the food.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They slid it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.
Where's Heather?
She's dead, Jake.
Everybody go!
<i>Jericho is about to be invaded.
<i>We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.
Most of you have no idea of
what's coming.
This isn't a fight about land.
This is a fight for our very existence.
I know this has great artistic merit,
but...
i'm taking these shoes off
in ten minutes.
So, if you don't want
to have to hide my toes...
Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable.
We can't really do this
without the best man anyway.
Where is Jake?
I don't see him.
Grandpa seems to be missing, too.
Take a wild guess where they are.
Right.
Oh, Beth.
It's so nice to see you, dear.
I need your help.
We need to go over
to the medical center.
- Is everyone in there?
- Yeah. We're just waiting for you.
How is it going out there?
They took Talbot's farm.
How many men?
I'd say 60... 70.
That's probably just
an advance team.
I would imagine they got more than that
up the road in reserve.
Constantino has us outnumbered
and outgunned.
If we split our force, and try
to defend each one of these farms,
he's goino toverwhelm us.
So what are you saying?
I'm saying we don't split up.
We choose a place to stand together,
deliver a good, hard counterpunch.
Let them know that,
if they intend to take from us,
it's going to cost them dearly.
How?
Well, right here.
Stanley Richmond's farm.
It's the last place
before this road divides,
and they start taking ground
faster than we can keep up.
Plus which it's the highest point
in the whole area.
There's where we make our stand.
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.
He told the farm is secured.
Let's go get the rest of them.
Let's go!
This one's alive.

<i>6 YEARS AGO
- Grandpa, you're drunk.
- Yeah!
Thank you, darling
Keep 'em coming.
Gail's going to get so mad at you
for getting her boy drunk.
I've got Gail wrapped
around my little finger.
Says the guy who taught me
to fly his crop duster when I was 13,
then told Mom I was lying
when I mentioned it.
I was so jealous.
My mom knew that you let him fly,
and she wouldn't let me go
anywhere near you.
You see, Jake would...
Jake would come over and tell me
all the stories you told him.
I loved...
I loved the one about the peanuts.
What the hell are you talking about?
The peanuts in World War II.
He means the "Nuts" story, Grandpa.
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.
So what's the story?
Tell me the story, somebody.
What? It's his story.
All right.
World War II.
The winter of 1944.
The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines,
and surrounded...
a division of Americans
in a little town called Bastogne,
freezing, starving and running out
of ammunition, but they knew...
that they had to hold that ground.
Just before Christmas,
the Nazis sent a note
to the American commander
telling him that he could
surrender and save the rt of his men,
or they could stay and fight.
The American commander
sent a one-word reply
to the Wehrmacht commander,
and it said...
- ... "Nuts."
Why did he say, "Nuts"?
It means, "Go to hell!"
Why didn't he just say, "Go to hell"?
Because he said, "Nuts. "
Gail, my sweetheart,
you look beautiful.
Save it, Dal.
Was it your idea
to get my son drunk tonight?
Right. Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.
- Come on.
- But I'm hammered.
And I want to talk to you.
Have a cup of coffee, Stanley.
Here.
Well, what's this?
As your brother's best man,
you are required to give a toast,
so I wrote down a few thoughts,
some things that
you might want to say.
You think I was going to wing it?
Let's go take some pictures, okay?
What's going on?
Mr. Green, I have access
to a keyhole military satellite
that I can use to track New Bern's
movements in the field today.
- Beg pardon?
- It's real.
The one restriction...
is that no one can know
where you're getting this information.
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field,
tell them what you want...
but the satellite must remain a secret.
Sounds good.
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?
I get it. Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.
- But...
- I am about to go to war,
with New Bern, Kansas,
the home of the nearest Costco.
Today is already just about
as weird as I can handle.
I'm not asking any more questions.
Mom, Dad,
there's a chance we may have
to leave here today,
and we might not be able
to make it back, so...
I just wanted to...
We just...
wanted to pay our respects.
Remember I told you about that witch,
from the IRS?
The one that wanted
to take everything
you've ever worked for?
Mom, Dad...
this is Mimi.
Hello.
It's nice to finally meet you.
I really love your son.
And, of course,
Bonnie is...
she's just wonderful.
And I've really enjoyed
living with them and...
- Oh, great.
- What?
I didn't say we were living together.
We're not married.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly... I...
Is everything a joke to you?
I figure one day we're going
to be buried here ourselves,
and I...
think it would be nice if...
our kids came and,
and joked around with us.
I hope that's not
for a really long time.
How we doing?
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.
We got more coming, right?
They're trickling in. It's taking
a lot longer than we thought.
Saying good-bye to their families.
Get on down to the pass.
Get everybody organized.
We don't have a whole lot of time
before their advance unit hits.
- Not you.
- Why not?
Because these people
elected you their leader.
We protect you at all costs.
And, besides, in a few minutes,
I'm going to need your help.
Help with what?
Arming our tank.
Our daughter is out there carrying
a rifle and... I'm in here.
Sam needs you here.
You know, Allie's safe.
She's been assigned to Town Hall,
and the fighting is miles from there.
Right now, there really isn't
anything else you can be doing.
Here we go.
<i>Jake, you are about
to have company.
Already?
<i>New Bern is on its way.
There are...
<i>70, maybe... 80 men.
Is that tank there yet?
They're trying to load it
with that mortar round right now.
I think you're gonna need it.
All right, let's get ready!
They're coming!
Get some ammo down here!
What is it?
I'm being tracked.
Tracked?
What do you mean?
Someone is trying to trace my location
through the satellite.
- Well, can they?
- If they have time, yes.
Do you know who it is?
My guess is, it's... Valente.
What him?
From... Homeland Security?
I don't know who he's working for now,
but he told Sarah
to get the bomb any way she could
and to eliminate all witnesses.
All the witnesses.
- Shut it down.
- No, I can't.
We just have to make sure we disconnect
the feed before he finishes the trace.
I don't get it.
- Why are they just standing there?
- I don't know.
Do we fire the first shot?
New Bern's here.
Get into position.
We're gonna need that tank.
Having a good time?
By the way, I think I saw April
making out with Shep Cale.
All right, all right.
You need to stop drinking.
Listen.
Read this.
It's a speech.
Figure you should have something ready,
so you don't embarrass yourself.
You mean so I don't embarrass you,
because you don't have to worry.
Is that how you spell
"venereal disease"?
This day is important to me, okay?
Just because your life's a big joke
doesn't mean you have
to treat mine that way.
Why is my life a joke?
- Just read the speech.
- No, seriously, Eric,
why is my life a joke?
- I'm not getting into this right now.
All right.
You think people don't wonder
what you've been doing?
You spend all that time
in flight school getting your license.
Instead of using it,
you come back here,
hanging out like it's the summer
after high school.
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.
If I'm such a joke,
then why'd you want me as your best man?
You didn't want me, did you?
No, not really.
Where's that tank?
We're not going to last long
against those trucks.
We have to hold out.
Damn it!
- Got to keep drawing their fire,
all right?  - Got It.
Give me another mag.
Where are you going?
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill...
and shot on the gunner.
- I got your back.
- All right.
Cover him!
Why eliminate witnesses?
I mean, whoever's tracking you,
they either...
want to use the bomb
for themselves or...
they want to keep you
from using it, but...
either way,
what difference do witnesses make?
The bombs have fingerprints,
don't they? Something that...
make them traceable.
I remember reading that.
It's the uranium.
It has...
It has a specific signature.
It places the origin of the device
where it was made.
So there were dozens of these things
used in the attacks, right?
And now you have the last one.
I don't think these people are looking
at this thing as a weapon.
It's more than that.
It's...
Evidence.
It's the smoking gun
behind the greatest crime
in the history of the world.
The bomb...
it could expose the people...
who were responsible for the attacks.
That's why they need it back.
Did u see what I just did?
Holy crap.
That was...
<i>Holy crap!
All right, that bought us some time.
But they'll be back,
and there'll be more of them.
And it won't be near as easy
next time.
Easy?
You thought that was easy?
Dad?
What's wrong?
Clear the table!
Clear it!
- Clear it!
- I'm gonna go get Kenchy.
- Get my mom!
- We'll need towels.
And some antiseptic,
and some alcohol.
- We need alcohol.
- Get a towel!
Get me some alcohol!
Here we go.
Give me that, come on!
Okay, all right.
Keep the pressure on.
What?
Keep it on! Keep the pressure.
<i>Jake, come in.
Nice work out there.
<i>Tell your father that
they're coming back around.
He's been shot.
I'm sorry.
You know what to do, right?
<i>Keep pressure on the wound,
<i>and there should be some morphine
syrettes in the... supplies I gave you.
Yeah, we've got it.
Listen, Jake.
<i>People are gonna be
looking to you now.
<i>You know what I mean?
Okay, the guys will be back.
They retreated to Talbot's farm.
<i>My guess is,
they're waiting for reinforcements,
<i>so you should have a little time
to regroup out there.
<i>Just keep the radio close,
and I'll update you.
Out.
Out.
Please, I need to talk
whoever's in charge.
Right over there.
Excuse me, sir?
Colonel Hoffman.
You don't have to call me sir,
unless you plan to enlist.
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.
It's planning to overrun the town
of Jericho. People are gonna get killed.
They tried to kill me,
but I got away.
- You've got to help these people.
- Where is this?
Kansas, not far from
the Colorado border.
I wish I could help. My orders are
to secure the roads in this area.
- But, sir...
- I don't get to make these decisions.
I'm just a government employee.
Which government?
United States.
Are you all right, ma'am?
We heard there were six different people
claiming the presidency.
There were. In fact, there are still
a couple of holdouts...
Texas, a bloc in the East.
The new federal government's
been restored in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Colonel, this is an emergency.
You have to go to Jericho. The fighting
could be happening right now.
I am very sorry, ma'am.
Casper, you see she gets back
to the medical unit.
Come on, ma'am.
Get 'em out.
Get 'em out.
Clear everyone out.
You listen...
This place,
is where you survive.
You make a stand here,
you hear?
We will.
I'm sorry you have to see this.
You've been through enough.
Dad...
Dad, stop.
You're stronger than you think
you are, though.
Always have been.
I love you, son.
I guess I zigged when I should've
zagged out there, huh?
I sure wish your mother was here.
She's coming.
She'll be here.
Tell your mother I love her.
I was... hard on you.
I pushed you... away.
I'm glad you... came... home.
I'm proud of you.
The big toast.
Before I start,
is there anyone who...
hasn't written me a speech?
It really makes me wonder
how screwed up you think I am
that I can't be trusted
to say a few things...
about my brother.
The thing is...
these are all pretty lame.
Not one of them mentions
my brother's musical theater phase
when we all thought he was gay.
Seriously.
You have not heard disturbing
until you've heard him singing
"One Hand, One Heart"
in the shower every morning.
I tease my brother a lot,
but...
the truth is...
the truth is I'm very proud of him.
I'm...
I'm proud of how kind he is...
I'm proud of how giving he is,
and...
he's a very lucky man.
Really.
My father's dead.
We'll get through.
Get Gray back to town.
What?
Wait a minute...
Come tomorrow,
what's left of us will need a leader.
I think we've lost enough
in that department for one day.
We're gonna need
every set of hands we can get.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're too important now, Gray.
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.
And start getting everyone
into position.
Who knows when
they're gonna come back again?
Go ahead.
<i>So they got their reinforcements.
<i>It's a couple hundred men.
<i>And another six of those
deuce and a halfs.
<i>They're mobilizing now,
so I say you got about 15,
<i>maybe 20 minutes
before they're on you.
You get back here as soon as you can.
All right?
Say, what do you know about
a set of train tracks
running alongside the river?
Why?
What do you see?
<i>Hawkins, what's on the tracks?
I don't know. I can't see.
- Hang on.
- Robert, disconnect it.
Jake, you got a very large train
coming from New Bern,
<i>and they've got three cargo cars.
<i>What's in them?
I think it's men,
and there's hundreds of them.
It's a whole set of reinforcement...
Hawkins, what's going on?
Talk to me.
<i>I'm on my way.
I've got to go.
Wait.
Look, they only had a few seconds.
It wasn't enough time
to get an exact location.
- We're fine for a little while.
- Where are you going?
I have to stop a train.
I-80 is secured
from Cheyenne to Grand Island.
We now control the area
between Kearney and Hastings.
I-70 is turning out to be a challenge.
There are organized road gangs
controlling much of the interstate.
I've also been told by a patient
in our medical unit
to expect a significant skirmish
between two towns
in northwest Kansas:
New Bern and Jericho.
<i>What is the location of those towns?
CZ-12, Quadrant Four.
<i>We've tracked the terror suspect
to within 200 miles of that area.
<i>Capture of this suspect
is a top priority
<i>for President Tomarchio
and the administration.
<i>Do you understand?
- Should I re-prioritize, sir?
- <i>Immediately.
Go to Jericho and crush the skirmish.
Once the area's clear,
we will begin our search
for the terrorist.
I'm gonna ask Mimi to marry me.
Yeah?
Yeah. She can't cook,
she's never seen nine innings
of baseball in her life,
she hates my clothes...
but I love her.
And I'm happy.
Jake, I don't want to die today.
You're gonna make it out of here.
That I promise.
Constantino and those trucks
are right on your doorstep.
You don't have much time.
What about that train?
20 minutes, give or take.
Tell me you have a plan,
a really good one.
I need to borrow your tank.
It won't fire.
I told you that, right?
There's not a single
round of ammo in it.
I'm not planning on shooting anything.
The throttle's there on your left.
And to steer, you're just gonna...
Hey. This is not my first time.
Good luck out there.
You, too.
Any minute now, huh?
I'm...
You know, he's here...
watching.
You know that, right?
They still doing
the bunny hop in there?
I think it's the Macarena.
The what?
Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop.
Quite a speech you made in there.
I had no idea you were
such a sentimental fool.
Mom wrote it.
You think?
Listen, I know that you and Eric
aren't close and...
maybe you didn't feel like standing up
in front of a bunch of people and...
acting like you were.
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing
and doing what needs to be done
are two different things.
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.
I'm fine.
I somehow get the feeling
my worrying days are far from over.
But they will be one day.
One day, I know you're gonna become
the man I know you can be,
the man you were born to be.
My God, that day's gonna be
something to see.
Come on, Johnston.
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.
Me and the old man are gonna
head down to the lake
and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?
Yeah. I'm just gonna...
wait for Emily, say good night.
I'll...
meet you there.
I'll save you a place.
- Where's he going?
- Waiting for Emily, say good night.
That's the last we'll see
of him tonight.
Dad...
If I had a girl that looked like that,
I wouldn't keep her waiting.
You hear that, boy?
I'm gonna take that girl
away from you.
You talk a good game.
You better watch out
for yourself, too.
Your wife is crazy about me.
Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory
switch to you three times a day.
It's Constantino.
I'm here.
<i>My scouts just informed me.
<i>I am sorry about your father.
You're outmanned,
and you're outgunned.
There's too many of us and
we are too desperate to give up.
You cannot win this.
I'm giving you one last chance.
<i>Walk away,
put your guns down...
Walk away,
put your guns down...
and return to town,
and no one else will be harmed.
Jake, I need an answer.
What's it gonna be?
Nuts.
Sorry, I didn't get that.
You can go straight to hell.
About my father...
you're the one I'm coming for.
I want to go home.
Our orders are to take people
out of the conflict zone.
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.
Colonel Hoffman?
What is all this?
- Sir, wheels up in five minutes.
- Roger that.
- Jericho's been moved up to priority #1
on the list.  - Thank you.
Oh, God, thank you.
This is all thanks to you.
Don't worry. We're gonna get things
back to normal again.
All right, saddle up.
My father expected us
to make a stand here.
To defend our home.
That's what we're gonna do.
Smoke bombs!
Get in position!
Don't waste your rounds!
Wait for a clean shot!
Wait...
Wait...
Wait...
Now!

<i>Previously on </i>Jericho
Oh, my God... Ted !
We grew up together over in New Bern.
- You just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No. The question is, how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
They get tired of you being sheriff?
<i>Can we buy some more of these things?
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, we'll give you the food.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They slid it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.
Where's Heather?
She's dead, Jake.
Everybody go!
<i>Jericho is about to be invaded.
<i>We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.
Most of you have no idea of
what's coming.
This isn't a fight about land.
This is a fight for our very existence.
I know this has great artistic merit,
but...
i'm taking these shoes off
in ten minutes.
So, if you don't want
to have to hide my toes...
Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable.
We can't really do this
without the best man anyway.
Where is Jake?
I don't see him.
Grandpa seems to be missing, too.
Take a wild guess where they are.
Right.
Oh, Beth.
It's so nice to see you, dear.
I need your help.
We need to go over
to the medical center.
- Is everyone in there?
- Yeah. We're just waiting for you.
How is it going out there?
They took Talbot's farm.
How many men?
I'd say 60... 70.
That's probably just
an advance team.
I would imagine they got more than that
up the road in reserve.
Constantino has us outnumbered
and outgunned.
If we split our force, and try
to defend each one of these farms,
he's goino toverwhelm us.
So what are you saying?
I'm saying we don't split up.
We choose a place to stand together,
deliver a good, hard counterpunch.
Let them know that,
if they intend to take from us,
it's going to cost them dearly.
How?
Well, right here.
Stanley Richmond's farm.
It's the last place
before this road divides,
and they start taking ground
faster than we can keep up.
Plus which it's the highest point
in the whole area.
There's where we make our stand.
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.
He told the farm is secured.
Let's go get the rest of them.
Let's go!
This one's alive.

<i>6 YEARS AGO
- Grandpa, you're drunk.
- Yeah!
Thank you, darling
Keep 'em coming.
Gail's going to get so mad at you
for getting her boy drunk.
I've got Gail wrapped
around my little finger.
Says the guy who taught me
to fly his crop duster when I was 13,
then told Mom I was lying
when I mentioned it.
I was so jealous.
My mom knew that you let him fly,
and she wouldn't let me go
anywhere near you.
You see, Jake would...
Jake would come over and tell me
all the stories you told him.
I loved...
I loved the one about the peanuts.
What the hell are you talking about?
The peanuts in World War II.
He means the "Nuts" story, Grandpa.
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.
So what's the story?
Tell me the story, somebody.
What? It's his story.
All right.
World War II.
The winter of 1944.
The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines,
and surrounded...
a division of Americans
in a little town called Bastogne,
freezing, starving and running out
of ammunition, but they knew...
that they had to hold that ground.
Just before Christmas,
the Nazis sent a note
to the American commander
telling him that he could
surrender and save the rt of his men,
or they could stay and fight.
The American commander
sent a one-word reply
to the Wehrmacht commander,
and it said...
- ... "Nuts."
Why did he say, "Nuts"?
It means, "Go to hell!"
Why didn't he just say, "Go to hell"?
Because he said, "Nuts. "
Gail, my sweetheart,
you look beautiful.
Save it, Dal.
Was it your idea
to get my son drunk tonight?
Right. Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.
- Come on.
- But I'm hammered.
And I want to talk to you.
Have a cup of coffee, Stanley.
Here.
Well, what's this?
As your brother's best man,
you are required to give a toast,
so I wrote down a few thoughts,
some things that
you might want to say.
You think I was going to wing it?
Let's go take some pictures, okay?
What's going on?
Mr. Green, I have access
to a keyhole military satellite
that I can use to track New Bern's
movements in the field today.
- Beg pardon?
- It's real.
The one restriction...
is that no one can know
where you're getting this information.
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field,
tell them what you want...
but the satellite must remain a secret.
Sounds good.
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?
I get it. Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.
- But...
- I am about to go to war,
with New Bern, Kansas,
the home of the nearest Costco.
Today is already just about
as weird as I can handle.
I'm not asking any more questions.
Mom, Dad,
there's a chance we may have
to leave here today,
and we might not be able
to make it back, so...
I just wanted to...
We just...
wanted to pay our respects.
Remember I told you about that witch,
from the IRS?
The one that wanted
to take everything
you've ever worked for?
Mom, Dad...
this is Mimi.
Hello.
It's nice to finally meet you.
I really love your son.
And, of course,
Bonnie is...
she's just wonderful.
And I've really enjoyed
living with them and...
- Oh, great.
- What?
I didn't say we were living together.
We're not married.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly... I...
Is everything a joke to you?
I figure one day we're going
to be buried here ourselves,
and I...
think it would be nice if...
our kids came and,
and joked around with us.
I hope that's not
for a really long time.
How we doing?
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.
We got more coming, right?
They're trickling in. It's taking
a lot longer than we thought.
Saying good-bye to their families.
Get on down to the pass.
Get everybody organized.
We don't have a whole lot of time
before their advance unit hits.
- Not you.
- Why not?
Because these people
elected you their leader.
We protect you at all costs.
And, besides, in a few minutes,
I'm going to need your help.
Help with what?
Arming our tank.
Our daughter is out there carrying
a rifle and... I'm in here.
Sam needs you here.
You know, Allie's safe.
She's been assigned to Town Hall,
and the fighting is miles from there.
Right now, there really isn't
anything else you can be doing.
Here we go.
<i>Jake, you are about
to have company.
Already?
<i>New Bern is on its way.
There are...
<i>70, maybe... 80 men.
Is that tank there yet?
They're trying to load it
with that mortar round right now.
I think you're gonna need it.
All right, let's get ready!
They're coming!
Get some ammo down here!
What is it?
I'm being tracked.
Tracked?
What do you mean?
Someone is trying to trace my location
through the satellite.
- Well, can they?
- If they have time, yes.
Do you know who it is?
My guess is, it's... Valente.
What him?
From... Homeland Security?
I don't know who he's working for now,
but he told Sarah
to get the bomb any way she could
and to eliminate all witnesses.
All the witnesses.
- Shut it down.
- No, I can't.
We just have to make sure we disconnect
the feed before he finishes the trace.
I don't get it.
- Why are they just standing there?
- I don't know.
Do we fire the first shot?
New Bern's here.
Get into position.
We're gonna need that tank.
Having a good time?
By the way, I think I saw April
making out with Shep Cale.
All right, all right.
You need to stop drinking.
Listen.
Read this.
It's a speech.
Figure you should have something ready,
so you don't embarrass yourself.
You mean so I don't embarrass you,
because you don't have to worry.
Is that how you spell
"venereal disease"?
This day is important to me, okay?
Just because your life's a big joke
doesn't mean you have
to treat mine that way.
Why is my life a joke?
- Just read the speech.
- No, seriously, Eric,
why is my life a joke?
- I'm not getting into this right now.
All right.
You think people don't wonder
what you've been doing?
You spend all that time
in flight school getting your license.
Instead of using it,
you come back here,
hanging out like it's the summer
after high school.
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.
If I'm such a joke,
then why'd you want me as your best man?
You didn't want me, did you?
No, not really.
Where's that tank?
We're not going to last long
against those trucks.
We have to hold out.
Damn it!
- Got to keep drawing their fire,
all right?  - Got It.
Give me another mag.
Where are you going?
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill...
and shot on the gunner.
- I got your back.
- All right.
Cover him!
Why eliminate witnesses?
I mean, whoever's tracking you,
they either...
want to use the bomb
for themselves or...
they want to keep you
from using it, but...
either way,
what difference do witnesses make?
The bombs have fingerprints,
don't they? Something that...
make them traceable.
I remember reading that.
It's the uranium.
It has...
It has a specific signature.
It places the origin of the device
where it was made.
So there were dozens of these things
used in the attacks, right?
And now you have the last one.
I don't think these people are looking
at this thing as a weapon.
It's more than that.
It's...
Evidence.
It's the smoking gun
behind the greatest crime
in the history of the world.
The bomb...
it could expose the people...
who were responsible for the attacks.
That's why they need it back.
Did u see what I just did?
Holy crap.
That was...
<i>Holy crap!
All right, that bought us some time.
But they'll be back,
and there'll be more of them.
And it won't be near as easy
next time.
Easy?
You thought that was easy?
Dad?
What's wrong?
Clear the table!
Clear it!
- Clear it!
- I'm gonna go get Kenchy.
- Get my mom!
- We'll need towels.
And some antiseptic,
and some alcohol.
- We need alcohol.
- Get a towel!
Get me some alcohol!
Here we go.
Give me that, come on!
Okay, all right.
Keep the pressure on.
What?
Keep it on! Keep the pressure.
<i>Jake, come in.
Nice work out there.
<i>Tell your father that
they're coming back around.
He's been shot.
I'm sorry.
You know what to do, right?
<i>Keep pressure on the wound,
<i>and there should be some morphine
syrettes in the... supplies I gave you.
Yeah, we've got it.
Listen, Jake.
<i>People are gonna be
looking to you now.
<i>You know what I mean?
Okay, the guys will be back.
They retreated to Talbot's farm.
<i>My guess is,
they're waiting for reinforcements,
<i>so you should have a little time

What about that train?
20 minutes, give or take.
Tell me you have a plan,
a really good one.
I need to borrow your tank.
It won't fire.
I told you that, right?
There's not a single
round of ammo in it.
I'm not planning on shooting anything.
The throttle's there on your left.
And to steer, you're just gonna...
Hey. This is not my first time.
Good luck out there.
You, too.
Any minute now, huh?
I'm...
You know, he's here...
watching.
You know that, right?
They still doing
the bunny hop in there?
I think it's the Macarena.
The what?
Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop.
Quite a speech you made in there.
I had no idea you were
such a sentimental fool.
Mom wrote it.
You think?
Listen, I know that you and Eric
aren't close and...
maybe you didn't feel like standing up
in front of a bunch of people and...
acting like you were.
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing
and doing what needs to be done
are two different things.
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.
I'm fine.
I somehow get the feeling
my worrying days are far from over.
But they will be one day.
One day, I know you're gonna become
the man I know you can be,
the man you were born to be.
My God, that day's gonna be
something to see.
Come on, Johnston.
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.
Me and the old man are gonna
head down to the lake
and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?
Yeah. I'm just gonna...
wait for Emily, say good night.
I'll...
meet you there.
I'll save you a place.
- Where's he going?
- Waiting for Emily, say good night.
That's the last we'll see
of him tonight.
Dad...
If I had a girl that looked like that,
I wouldn't keep her waiting.
You hear that, boy?
I'm gonna take that girl
away from you.
You talk a good game.
You better watch out
for yourself, too.
Your wife is crazy about me.
Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory
switch to you three times a day.
It's Constantino.
I'm here.
<i>My scouts just informed me.
<i>I am sorry about your father.
You're outmanned,
and you're outgunned.
There's too many of us and
we are too desperate to give up.
You cannot win this.
I'm giving you one last chance.
<i>Walk away,
put your guns down...
Walk away,
put your guns down...
and return to town,
and no one else will be harmed.
Jake, I need an answer.
What's it gonna be?
Nuts.
Sorry, I didn't get that.
You can go straight to hell.
About my father...
you're the one I'm coming for.
I want to go home.
Our orders are to take people
out of the conflict zone.
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.
Colonel Hoffman?
What is all this?
- Sir, wheels up in five minutes.
- Roger that.
- Jericho's been moved up to priority #1
on the list.  - Thank you.
Oh, God, thank you.
This is all thanks to you.
Don't worry. We're gonna get things
back to normal again.
All right, saddle up.
My father expected us
to make a stand here.
To defend our home.
That's what we're gonna do.
Smoke bombs!
Get in position!
Don't waste your rounds!
Wait for a clean shot!
Wait...
Wait...
Wait...
Now!

...est palpable ŕ Capital Hill,
puisqu'une séance d'urgence du congrčs
s'appręte ŕ entendre le président
sur le sujet de la violence.
Les attaques récentes ont poussées cette administration
ŕ prendre des décisions extręmes
encourageant la peur plutôt qu'ŕ l'apaiser.
Avec cette tension grandissante,
le Président prend un risque considérable
En confrontant ce que certains observateurs politiques...
Oh, je n’en crois pas mes yeux!
Jake Green!
Comment vas-tu?
--Depuis quand t'es de retour en ville?
--Je viens d'arriver.
C'est Bonnie?
Tu as grandis!
Attends, mais ou étais-tu bon sang?
Tu sais, pas loin.
--Jake, personne n'est "pas loin" pendant 5 ans.
--Dans l'armée.
--J'étais dans l'armée.
--Tant mieux pour toi.
--Qui est-ce?
--Elle fait partie de l'IRS
--IRS? l'audit IRS?
--Oui.
--Ca ne va pas?
--Non.Laisse tomber.
Que dirais-tu de sortir avec moi ce soir,
et rattraper le temps perdu?
J'aurais adoré mais je viens juste
pour voir mon grand pčre, ensuite
--il faut que j'y retourne...
--Ok.
Bonnie!
Bonnie, on a besoin d'une tarte.
Une fraise-rhubarbe.
Bienvenue ŕ Jericho, Jake!
Sa femme est adorable,
mais lui je ne sais pas.
Mme Olsen m'a fait promettre de ne rien dire,
mais elle a entendu qu'il a payé cash
la propriété du vieux Thompson.
Cash...
--Cette couleur te va vraiment bien.
--Je sais.
--Pourquoi ta mčre ne t'as pas pris ŕ New York avec elle?
--Parcequ'elle me desteste.
Qu'est ce que tu regardes, abruti?
Je pourrais ętre en train de faire du shopping
ŕ Soho au lieu du "Magasin de Gracie"
-Je sais. Regarde ce truc--
--tellement dégueulasse.
--Vous promettez de ne rien dire?
--Promis, Mme Leigh.
Quoi de neuf chez vous Jake?
Oů étiez-vous caché?
J'ai joué en championnat de baseball.
Oh! Vraiment?
Et bien...
Quand comptes-tu rentrer de Chicago?
D’accord.
Bien. Je viendrais te chercher.
Moi aussi je t'aime.
--Hey!
--Désolée, salut. euh...
Que fais-tu ici?
Je suis juste revenu une journée
pour voir mon grand-pčre,
--voir ma famille.
--Oui, bien entendu.
--C'est juste que j'étais pas au courant.
--Bref, comment tu vas?
Maman m'a dit
que tu enseignes au lycée maintenant.
--Ouais, c'est bizarre, hein?
--Ouais.
J'adore ça.
Je viens d'acheter une maison dans les pins.
Côte Est avec un salaire d'enseignant?
Heu, m-mon fiancé,
il est banquier, donc...
--Oh, Ca aide.
--Ouais, Roger adore cet endroit.
Bien, je suis content pour toi Emily.
--Et toi? tu as quelqu'un?
--Non.
--Je suis désolée, je n'aurais pas dű...
--Non, tu ne l'es pas, tu adores ça.
--Oů étais-tu?
--Dans la Navy.
Oh, pourquoi je m'embęte?
Sérieusement...
Oů étais-tu?
(And you ask me what I want this year)
(And I try to make this kind and clear)
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days )
('Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings)
(And desire and love and empty things)
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days)
(So take these words..)
Oh, Jake!
Oh, mon chéri!
--Oh, tu es rentré!
--Tu m'étrangles Maman.
J'ai cru entendre une voix agacante.
--Hey, frčro.
--Content de te revoir.
('Cause tonight's the night the world begins again.)
Je ne suis pas lŕ pour faire de l'ombre ŕ ta campagne, Papa.
J'ai juste besoin de ta signature,
ensuite je vais voir Papi...
Aprčs 5 ans Jake,
C'est tout ce que tu as ŕ dire ŕ ton pčre?
--Ce n'est pas tes affaires Eric.
--C'est son problčme, c'est notre problčme ŕ tous.
--Ce que tu as fait endurer ŕ ta famille...
--Johnston. Pour l'amour de Dieu.
--Maintenant, il pourrait ętre...
--On pourrait passer une semaine ŕ parler
de ce que j'aurais pu devenir, ok?
J'ai présenté mes excuses.
J'ai changé.
C'est moi lŕ.
--J'ai un plan mais j'ai besoin de mon argent
pour prendre un nouveau départ.
--Ce n'est pas ton argent,
--C'est l'argent de ton grand pčre.
--Je sais, mais il ne me l'a pas donné sans raison.
Et ce n’est pas pour rien qu'il m'a donné procuration.
--Tu me convaincs que tu as une vie
plus stable et ensuite...
--C'est comme ça Jake.
Je te connais depuis tout petit,
arrętes de te croire supérieur ŕ moi!
--Quand allez-vous réaliser que j'ai 32 ans?
--Quand toi tu le réalisera.
Je peux parler au maire alors, hein?
Allons voir ton grand pčre.
--Je veux juste...
--Arręte, Jake.
--La seule chose que je ne peux pas...
--Je sais que tu serais venu si tu avais pu.
J'ai apporté de l'argent.
--Tiens
--Je ne peux pas, maman.
--Je vais parler ŕ ton pčre.
--Il ne comprend pas.
--Parce que tu ne lui diras pas
pourquoi tu as besoin de cet argent.
--Maman.
tu ne lui fais pas assez confiance.
--Ton pčre a aussi eu des coups durs tu sais.
--Il ne doit pas savoir.
Juste..
--Reste un jour de plus.
--Je dois retourner ŕ San Diego demain.
--Maman, encore une chose.
--Oui?
Tu es maladroite.
Je t'aime.
Sois prudent, D'accord?
Messieurs, Le President des Etats-Unis.
On est obligé de regarder ça ?
(Old McDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O)
On a finalement trouvé un garage pour la réparer.
On a du faire un détour.
...océan de haine...
Je me sens comme si j'étais
de retour ŕ Washington.
...dans notre grand pays, et dčjŕ,
Nous savons tous que ces divisions
ne sont rien en comparaison
des dangers posés par la menace de la terreur.
Notre responsabilité éternelle
est de laisser un monde meilleur
ŕ nos enfants et ŕ nos petits enfants.
Ceci a toujours été notre promesse
et le sera toujours...
5... 4... 3... 2... 1!
Nous serons de retour d'ici une heure M. McVey.
M. McVey? Allo?
...transporté sur...
Nous avons...
Ce n'est pas marrant, Woody!
Tu dois mieux te cacher!
Woody?
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes?
Regardez! Regardez ça!
Dépčches-toi, tout de suite.
Oui, vous devriez vous dépčcher
et rentrer chez vous alors.
Oů est Cody?
Quelqun a vu Cody?
On a pas de temps ŕ perdre.
Chut.
Gail? Que ce passe t’il?
Oh, Johnston.
Rien.
Ok, l'explosion semble provenir de l'Ouest,
peut-ętre Denver.
Jimmy, prends la radio,
je veux tout le monde au bureau du Shérif.
--Je vais prendre Eric. En avant!
--D'accord.
Papa, n'y va pas!
Viens ici.
Je serais bientôt de retour, d'accord?
Johnston!
Jake!
Nous allons le trouver.
On est en train de les sortir de la mine,
cinq ŕ la fois comme toujours.
Pas besoin de déclencher une émeute.
--Vous essayez juste de reduire le temps de travail
de mes hommes!
--Arrétez tout les deux.
Norman, fais sortir tout le monde
de la mine immédiatement.
Et Shep, aide-le pour changer.
- Shérif, Chef.
- Oui.
--Des dommages, Incendies, Des bâtiments?
--Rien du tout M. le Maire.
--Ta ville se porte bien.
--Bien, esperons que vous ayez raison.
Ca veut dire quoi?
Est-ce qu'on a des compteurs Geiger?
Pardon!
Uh, pardon.
Il s'est passé quelque chose?
Bon, que dit le plan d'urgence?
Contacter le gouverneur, la garde nationale et les militaires.
--On est attaqué?
--Fils, je ne veux plus jamais entendre ce mot!
Maintenant ecoutez, ça pourrait ętre un test.
Comme ça pourrait ętre un accident.
Il y a des bases militaires prčs de Denver.
Une explosion ne veut pas forcément dire attentat.
Si nous restons calmes,
la ville reste calme, ok?
Oh.
--J'ai trouvé les compteurs Geiger.
--Merci
Oh, Gray. Content de vous voir.
--Toute aide est la bienvenue.
--Bien, merci, Johnston, Eric.
--Que puis-je faire pour vous aider?
--Nous vous le dirons.
Ca marche, Papa?
Ça a l'air oui.
M. le Maire.
--Shérif-- La bombe?
--Oui, Mme, pour l'instant
aucun signe de radiation.
--On va continuer ŕ vérifier
les alentours de la ville.
--Non. non, monsieur.
Le bus scolaire de ma fille
n'est pas rentré de leur expédition.
--Faites quelque chose!
--J'ai compris.
--Vous-vous devriez ętre en train
de chercher Stacy en ce moment.
--Oui, Mme. Mme, Teresa,
On viens juste de l'apprendre,
mais nous allons nous en occuper, d'accord?
--Ne vous inquiétez pas s'il-vous-plait.
--C'est facile ŕ dire pour vous.
Vous n'avez pas d'enfant lŕ-bas.
Bon, le bus scolaire était lŕ aux grottes.
Qui peut me dire oů ils ont pu le faire réparer?
--Il y a le garage de Wilson sur la 160.
--Ou sur Cedar Run.
Le principal Movey dit
qu'ils ont pris une déviation
avant que le telephone ne se coupe.
Je propose de faire 2 équipes.
Il y a tellement d'endroits oů ils peuvent ętre.
--Et pourquoi pas les parents?
--C'est vrai, c'est vrai.
S'il-vous-plait. S'il-vous-plait! Tout le monde.
Ecoutez, je sais que vous voulez tous y aller.
Je ne vous en veux pas.
Mais en tant qu'ami, je vous demande d'y réflčchir.
Vous ętes en sécurité ici.
Que se passerait-il, Dieu nous protčge,
vous allez lŕ-bas, vous disparaissiez,
et vos enfants deviennent orphelins.
Vous connaissez le shérif et ses hommes.
Vous savez qu'ils vont les retrouver,
alors s'il-vous-plait.
A l'aide!
Monsieur!
Monsieur, S'il vous plait!
Monsieur!
Quoi? Que se passe t'il?
Monsieur, aidez-moi!
--Monsieur, s'il-vous-plait!
--Je crois qu'ils...
Je crois qu'ils sont entrain de mourir!
Jimmy, vient par ici et calme ces gens.
Nous sommes sur la bonne fréquence monsieur,
mais c'est comme si il n'y avait personne ŕ l'extčrieur.
Bon, um...
Et avec une radio analogique?
On pourrait contacter le gouverneur avec cette radio, non?
Cela pourrait fonctionner mais ŕ ce que
je sache il n'y en a qu'une seule en ville.
J'avais peur que vous me disiez ça.
Excusez-moi Shérif?.
Robert Hawkins.
Content de vous rencontrer M. Hawkins,
mais comme vous pouvez le voir,
nous sommes trčs occupés.
Avez-vous besoin d'un coup de main?
Pas de civil. Ordre du Maire.
A l'époque j'étais un flic. Saint Louis.
--Vous connaissez les routes du coin?
--Non, je viens juste de m'installer.
Je suis désolé alors,
mais vous ne feriez que nous ralentir.
Vous pourriez avoir besoin de peinture noire?
Vous savez, pour cacher ça.
Ecoutez, je sais que vous dites aux gens que c'était un accident.
Et j'espčre que c'est ça.
Mais si c'était une attaque, Shérif,
Et que c'est le chaos lŕ-bas,
vous ne voudriez pas qu'ils sachent
que Jericho est toujours lŕ.
Avec tout mon respect, Mr. Hawkins,
Nous ne sommes pas ŕ Saint-Louis.
--Papa, tout va bien?
--Oui, je vais bien.
Ne t'inquičtes pas pour moi.
Oh, Oliver! Veux-tu arręter ça?
Désolé, Johnston.
J'ai cru que vous étiez des extra-terrestres.
Nous subissons une attaque alien, vous savez?
Si. C'est la raison pour laquelle nous sommes lŕ.
--Est-ce que tu as toujours ta radio?
--Ouais.
--Pour toi ... 50 cents.
--Oliver
J'ai besoin de ces 50 cents!
Ok.
Je vais chercher la monnaie.
Salut Dale, désolé je n'ai pas pu appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé de rester en ville
quelques jours de plus.
--Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
--Chéri, arrętes. C'est mon gamin.
--Bébé, Qu'est ce que tu regardes par la fenętre?
--Viens ici et regardes ça!
C'est quoi?
Oh mon Dieu, oh mon Dieu...
Salut Dale, désolé je n'ai pas pu appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé de rester en ville
quelques jours de plus.
--Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
--Chéri...
...mais nous avons décidé de rester
en ville quelques jours de plus.
Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
Ché... Salut Dale, désolé je n'ai pas pu
appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé...
Salut Dale, désolé je n'ai pas pu appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé de rester en ville
quelques jours de plus.
--Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
--Chéri, arrętes. C'est mon gamin.Bébé...
--Comment se fait-il que l'électricité ait été coupée?
--Je ne sais pas.
La bombe a peut-ętre grillé les relais.
--C'est possible?
--Je sais pas.
Ils ont peut-ętre fait exploser toute
la centrale électrique qu'est-ce qu'on en sait!
Hé Les gars, c'est probablement juste une fuite
sur le systčme venant de Denver.
Est-ce vous professeur de sciences?
--Robert Hawkins.
--Chef Carol.
--Hey.
--Hey.
Jimmy, Ou ętes-vous?
Willow Creek, shérif.
Il n'y a rien ici.
Le cerf est devenu fou et a commencé
ŕ courir au milieu de la route.
Ok, ne le regarde pas.
Il est vivant?
Oui.
--Ca va?
--Oui.
Je crois que ma jambe est cassée.
--Pouvez-vous sentir vos orteils?
--Oui.
Ne vous inquiétez pas pour moi.
Inquiétez-vous plutôt pour eux.
Quelqu'un est-il blessé?
Quelqu’un?
Stacy est malade.
Elle ne peut pas respirer.
Pourquoi?
Que s'est-il passé?
Quand le bus s'est arręté,
Elle était comme ça.
Tout va bien Stacy, laisse moi jeter un oeil.
Tu me laisse regarder?
Je peux voir?
Laisse moi jeter un oeil Stacy.
Tout va bien. Tout va bien.
Vous avez de la glace?
Nous devons arręter le gonflement maintenant.
Lucas, le kit de premiers soins est sous le sičge.
Tu vas bien.
Aller, tout va bien.
Contentes-toi de respirer.
Respire normalement, ok?
Ca va. Ca va. Tu vas bien.
Continue ŕ respirer normalement.
Ok. Tu vas bien.
Tu vas bien.
S'il te plait...
Calme-toi. Calme-toi.
Hey, Stacy!
Non, non, non!
Réfléchis! Réfléchis!
Réfléchis!
Ok.
Ecoutez, j'ai besoin de l'aide de tout le monde ici.
Quelqu'un a un stylo?
Qui?
Quelqu'un a t’il un stylo?
j'ai besoin d'un stylo.
--Nous avons des feutres.
--Non, j'ai besoin d'un tube.
Quelque chose de creux, hum..
Une paille.
--J'ai une paille.
--Ok, laisse-moi voir.
Aller, fais-moi voir!
Non, c'est trop fin.
Quelqu'un d'autre a un jus de fruit?
--Moi.
--Ok, sortez-les tous.
Sors-moi le sparadrap.
--Comment tu t'appelles?
--Julie.
Ok, donnez tous vos pailles ŕ Julie.
Vite, dépęchez-vous!
Faites un rond avec!
Ok, c'est bon?
On y est, accroche-les ensemble avec le sparadrap.
Aller Stacy! Aller!
Qui est le plus fort ici?
Toi. J'ai besoin que tu maintiennes ses épaules,
au cas oů elle se réveille, d'accord?
Ne regarde pas.
Oů sont mes pailles, Julie?
Aller! Aller!
Respire pour moi, okai? S'il te plait.
Aller, Aller.
Attends! Je vois quelque chose.
--Okay. Okay, On voit le bus.
--Super.
--Vous avez besoin de nous?
--Non, continuez de chercher Jake.
Allons-y les gars.
Comment avez-vous appris ŕ faire ça?
Ecole Militaire.
Vous étiez un soldat?
Non, j'ai raté.
Shérif!
Shérif, Regardez ça!
Ce n'est pas le bon bus!
Riley? Riley, viens par ici!
Riley!
Génial!
Oů est cette putain d'équipe de sauvetage?
Oh, bonsoir Dale.
Aller viens, Rentre chéri.
Viens, on essaie de tous de surmonter
cette épreuve ensemble.
Salut, Dale.
Tout va bien Chéri?
C'est quoi ça?
C'est ma mčre.
Salut Dale, désolée je n'ai pas pu appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé de rester en ville quelques jours de plus.
--Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
--Chéri, arrętes. C'est mon gamin.
Bébé, qu'est ce que tu regardes par la fenętre?
Viens ici et regarde ça!
C'est quoi?
Oh mon Dieu, oh mon Dieu...
Oh, Dale. Je suis tellement désolée.
Je ne savais pas que ta mčre était ŕ Denver.
Elle n'était pas ŕ Denver.
Elle était ŕ Atlanta.
Oh mon Dieu!
Je suis sűre qu'ils auront des réponses.
Oh mon Dieu!
Comment va t'elle?
Nous devons la ramener.
Ici, Ici.
Melle Lisinski. Est-ce qu'on aura école demain?
On verra ma puce.
Je vote non.
Dale. Dale, qu'est-ce que tu fais chéri?
S'il te plait. Ne prends rien!
Dale!
--Pręt?
--Oui, Oui.
Hey, Il y en a encore lŕ-bas?
Premier arrivé, premier servis.
Tu as déjŕ remplis ton camion,
tu vas tondre ta pelouse aussi?
--J'ai une famille tu sais.
--On a tous une famille.
S'il-te-plait.
Enlčve tes mains de ce bidon!
Aller!
Oů tu crois lŕ, hein?
--Qu'est-ce que vous faites?
--Quel est le problčme?
D'accord, tout le monde s'assoit.
Vite.
La nourriture ne va pas pourrir
tant que le temps restera frais.
En espérant que le courant soit rétabli d'ici lŕ.
Merci pour tout, Dale.
Pas de problčme, m'dame.
--Eloignes-toi de la voiture!
--Sors de la voiture.
--Hey! Hey! Arrętez!
--Séparez-vous!
Dégage.
Vous avez besoin de mettre un peu de lumiere.
Avant que vous ne commenciez ŕ perdre des personnes.
Tout ce que nous avons ce sont des lanternes
et des lampes de poche.
Ca ne suffira pas ŕ éclairer la rue.
Mais votre ville répare les routes la nuit non?
Excuse-moi!
--Votre machine ne fonctionne pas.
--Tu vas devoir payer en cash.
Vous ętes sűr que vous n'ętes pas professeur de sciences?
Chef, on a un petit problčme ici ŕ la station d'essence.
On a besoin de votre aide tout de suite.
--J'arrive.
--Je m'en occupe.
--Je viens avec vous.
--Ok, merci.
Monsieur...
Nous avons un problčme ŕ la station d'essence.
Grande foule.
On dirait qu'il y a des problčmes.
Nous avons besoin de votre aide ici.
--Papa!
--J'ai entendu.
En avant!
--Sara?
--Tout va bien.
Chéri?
Je n'ai pas le temps maintenant.
--Des idiots ont...
--Johnston.
--Quoi?
--Ecoute moi.
La mčre de Dale Turner est morte ce soir
dans une autre explosion.
Atlanta.
Oh mon Dieu.
Shérif?
Il n'y a aucun signe de Jake ici.
En fait il n'y a aucun signe de qui que ce soit.
Nous allons...
Nous allons rentrer.
Tenez-moi au courant si les enfants
ont besoin de quelque chose.
Shérif, vous ętes lŕ?
Reste éveillé,
reste éveillé, ne...
Est-ce que ce bus a un bidon d'essence?
Si le bus...
s'arręte...
Okay.
Les enfants, écoutez-moi.
Si le bus s'arręte encore,
Vous devrez marcher jusqu'ŕ la ville.
et ramener de l'aide, okay?
Je ne sais pas oů nous sommes.
Quand vous arriverez au panneau STOP,
tournez ŕ gauche, Ok?
Prenez ŕ gauche.
C'est oů la gauche?
Mettez vos mains en l'air...
Et dépliez vos pouces.
Celle qui forme un "L"
Voilŕ votre gauche.
Dégages tes mains de moi!
Fais quelque chose, veux-tu?
County Edwards! Carl! Carl!
Arrętez immédiatement!
Oui Morty c'est ŕ toi que je parles!
Michael Stevenson.
Carl Meeks... Carl!
Pourquoi vous disputez-vous?
Vous vous volez entre voisins?
Vous vous battez contre les mauvaises personnes.
Nous sommes complčtement dans le noir.
Tout ce que je dis c'est que je pense
qu'il faut qu'on s'organise.
Je...
Je ne sais pas oů est le Maire,
Mais peut-ętre il serait peut-ętre temps
qu'on élabore un plan nous-męmes.
Que ce passe t’il Gray?
On fait des discours maintenant?
Avec tout votre respect monsieur le Maire,
Nous avons un bus manquant,
pas de police
et des pompiers faisant le travail des flics.
--Comment osez-vous faire de la politique maintenant?
--Eric. Eric.
Je ne parle pas ŕ mon adversaire,
mais au Maire.
Je me fous des élections,
je cherche ŕ survivre.
Il se peut que nous soyons les seuls survivants,
Et j'ai besoin de savoir ce que mon Maire compte faire.
Ecoutez, je sais qu'on a dű endurer beaucoup ce soir.
Mais je vais vous dire quelque chose.
J'ai été dans des grandes villes.
J'ai été dans des pays étrangers,
mais ŕ choisir, je choisirais les gens...
...les gens de Jericho, entre toute autre ville.
Nous sommes au courant Mr le Maire,
nous avons déjŕ entendu votre discours.
Bien, Shep, j'espčre que vous ne pensez pas
que je m'étais assoupi au pupitre.
Nous avons tous espéré que ce soit un accident.
Mais la triste vérité est
qu'une autre explosion a eu lieu ŕ Atlanta.
--Comment?
--Oh mon Dieu.
--J'ai essayé de contacter le gouverneur.
--Oui? Bien, mais si le gouverneur était mort?
Il n'y a aucun rapport sur le fait
qu'il ce soit passé quelque chose ŕ Topeka.
--Comment allons nous avoir des rapport sans télévision?
--Ou de téléphones?
Et New York?
--Nous ne savons rien ŕ propos de New York.
--Quand est-ce que le courant va ętre rétabli?
--Est-ce que l'eau est potable?
--Une ŕ la fois, s'il-vous-plait.
--Calmez-vous.
--Se calmer? Mon garçon est toujours lŕ-bas.
Le Shérif est actuellement lŕ-bas
ŕ la recherche de votre fils et de mon fils.
Et si on avait plus d'officiers de police lŕ-bas?
--Nous devons savoir ce que vous avez prévu de faire.
--Personne ne peut répondre ŕ ça.
Aidez-les! Aidez-les!
C'est Stacy.
Hey, toi, petite.
--Tu vas bien?
--Je m'occupe de toi.
Comment vous appelez vous?
--Heather.
--Jake
--Heureuse de vous rencontrer Jake.
--Moi aussi.
Maman!
--Tu m'as tellement manqué.
--Je t'aime.
Hey, mon chéri!
Papa, il y avait ce cerf...
Maman est juste lŕ.
Je suis lŕ ma chérie.
Tout va bien se passer.
--Jake.
--M'man
--Ton visage!
--Ca va aller.
--Oh, Chéri.
--Ca va?
Oui, bien sur.
Eric, Aide ton frčre.
--Passes ton bras autour de moi.
- Fait attention! Fait attention!
Doucement. Doucement.
Ok.
--Eric, Prends April. On se voit au centre médical.
--Ok.
Hey, Hey , il y a un bus de prisonnier vide lŕ-bas.
--Vers oů?
--Cedar Run.
D'accord, détends-toi.
Je m'en occupe.
--Dieu! Regardes-toi, tu es amoché.
--Ca va.
--Arręte de t'inqičter pour moi.
--Et bien, compte pas dessus.
Hey, Shep!
Vous avez dit avant que vous aviez déjŕ entendu mon discours.
Vous vous ętes déjŕ demandé pourquoi je l'ai dit?
Car j'ai confiance en vous!
Car j'aime ma ville.
Aujourd'hui quelque chose s'est passé ŕ Denver et Atlanta
et il est possible que l'on se réveille
et qu'on découvre que ça s'arręte lŕ.
Mais jusqu'ŕ ce que nous soyons sűrs,
Allons-nous utiliser notre imagination
pour résoudre les problčmes
ou pour les creer?
Quand on aura rétabli le courant
on pourra découvrir l'étendue de cette chose.
S'il le faut, nous pouvons combattre.
Nous pouvons combattre n'importe qui.
Nous pouvons battres tous nos ennemis.
La seule façon pour que ça marche
c'est si nous travaillons ensemble.
Maintenant, rentrez chez vous.
On se voit demain ŕ la Mairie.
Et s'il-vous-plait...
ne me faites plus jamais ça.
Chef, que tous vos hommes gardent
leurs positions jusqu'au retour du Shérif.
Hey... Shep.
J'ai eu peur de ne plus jamais te revoir.
Aller. Tu crois que j'aurais laissé
papa avoir le dernier mot?
Hey.
Assez parlé de moi.
Tu as fait quelque chose de grand ce soir.
Merci.
Ton grand-pčre aurait été fier.
Je vais voir ce qu'il leur prend autant de temps.
Tu sais , je pars pendant quelques années
et la ville tombe en enfer.
Je suis content que tu sois rentré.
Ouais, on verra.
A quoi vous pensez?
Je me demandais juste ŕ quoi tout ça
va ressembler demain matin.
(I'll sing it one last time for you)
(Then we really have to go)
(You've been the only thing that's right)
(In all I've done...)
Qu'est-ce qui ce passe?
(Light up, light up)
(As if you have a choice)
(even if you cannot hear... )

...est palpable ŕ Capital Hill,
puisqu'une séance d'urgence du congrčs
s'appręte ŕ entendre le président
sur le sujet de la violence.
Les attaques récentes ont poussées cette administration
ŕ prendre des décisions extręmes
encourageant la peur plutôt qu'ŕ l'apaiser.
Avec cette tension grandissante,
le Président prend un risque considérable
En confrontant ce que certains observateurs politiques...
Oh, je n’en crois pas mes yeux!
Jake Green!
Comment vas-tu?
--Depuis quand t'es de retour en ville?
--Je viens d'arriver.
C'est Bonnie?
Tu as grandis!
Attends, mais ou étais-tu bon sang?
Tu sais, pas loin.
--Jake, personne n'est "pas loin" pendant 5 ans.
--Dans l'armée.
--J'étais dans l'armée.
--Tant mieux pour toi.
--Qui est-ce?
--Elle fait partie de l'IRS
--IRS? l'audit IRS?
--Oui.
--Ca ne va pas?
--Non.Laisse tomber.
Que dirais-tu de sortir avec moi ce soir,
et rattraper le temps perdu?
J'aurais adoré mais je viens juste
pour voir mon grand pčre, ensuite
--il faut que j'y retourne...
--Ok.
Bonnie!
Bonnie, on a besoin d'une tarte.
Une fraise-rhubarbe.
Bienvenue ŕ Jericho, Jake!
Sa femme est adorable,
mais lui je ne sais pas.
Mme Olsen m'a fait promettre de ne rien dire,
mais elle a entendu qu'il a payé cash
la propriété du vieux Thompson.
Cash...
--Cette couleur te va vraiment bien.
--Je sais.
--Pourquoi ta mčre ne t'as pas pris ŕ New York avec elle?
--Parcequ'elle me desteste.
Qu'est ce que tu regardes, abruti?
Je pourrais ętre en train de faire du shopping
ŕ Soho au lieu du "Magasin de Gracie"
-Je sais. Regarde ce truc--
--tellement dégueulasse.
--Vous promettez de ne rien dire?
--Promis, Mme Leigh.
Quoi de neuf chez vous Jake?
Oů étiez-vous caché?
J'ai joué en championnat de baseball.
Oh! Vraiment?
Et bien...
Quand comptes-tu rentrer de Chicago?
D’accord.
Bien. Je viendrais te chercher.
Moi aussi je t'aime.
--Hey!
--Désolée, salut. euh...
Que fais-tu ici?
Je suis juste revenu une journée
pour voir mon grand-pčre,
--voir ma famille.
--Oui, bien entendu.
--C'est juste que j'étais pas au courant.
--Bref, comment tu vas?
Maman m'a dit
que tu enseignes au lycée maintenant.
--Ouais, c'est bizarre, hein?
--Ouais.
J'adore ça.
Je viens d'acheter une maison dans les pins.
Côte Est avec un salaire d'enseignant?
Heu, m-mon fiancé,
il est banquier, donc...
--Oh, Ca aide.
--Ouais, Roger adore cet endroit.
Bien, je suis content pour toi Emily.
--Et toi? tu as quelqu'un?
--Non.
--Je suis désolée, je n'aurais pas dű...
--Non, tu ne l'es pas, tu adores ça.
--Oů étais-tu?
--Dans la Navy.
Oh, pourquoi je m'embęte?
Sérieusement...
Oů étais-tu?
(And you ask me what I want this year)
(And I try to make this kind and clear)
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days )
('Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings)
(And desire and love and empty things)
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days)
(So take these words..)
Oh, Jake!
Oh, mon chéri!
--Oh, tu es rentré!
--Tu m'étrangles Maman.
J'ai cru entendre une voix agacante.
--Hey, frčro.
--Content de te revoir.
('Cause tonight's the night the world begins again.)
Je ne suis pas lŕ pour faire de l'ombre ŕ ta campagne, Papa.
J'ai juste besoin de ta signature,
ensuite je vais voir Papi...
Aprčs 5 ans Jake,
C'est tout ce que tu as ŕ dire ŕ ton pčre?
--Ce n'est pas tes affaires Eric.
--C'est son problčme, c'est notre problčme ŕ tous.
--Ce que tu as fait endurer ŕ ta famille...
--Johnston. Pour l'amour de Dieu.
--Maintenant, il pourrait ętre...
--On pourrait passer une semaine ŕ parler
de ce que j'aurais pu devenir, ok?
J'ai présenté mes excuses.
J'ai changé.
C'est moi lŕ.
--J'ai un plan mais j'ai besoin de mon argent
pour prendre un nouveau départ.
--Ce n'est pas ton argent,
--C'est l'argent de ton grand pčre.
--Je sais, mais il ne me l'a pas donné sans raison.
Et ce n’est pas pour rien qu'il m'a donné procuration.
--Tu me convaincs que tu as une vie
plus stable et ensuite...
--C'est comme ça Jake.
Je te connais depuis tout petit,
arrętes de te croire supérieur ŕ moi!
--Quand allez-vous réaliser que j'ai 32 ans?
--Quand toi tu le réalisera.
Je peux parler au maire alors, hein?
Allons voir ton grand pčre.
--Je veux juste...
--Arręte, Jake.
--La seule chose que je ne peux pas...
--Je sais que tu serais venu si tu avais pu.
J'ai apporté de l'argent.
--Tiens
--Je ne peux pas, maman.
--Je vais parler ŕ ton pčre.
--Il ne comprend pas.
--Parce que tu ne lui diras pas
pourquoi tu as besoin de cet argent.
--Maman.
tu ne lui fais pas assez confiance.
--Ton pčre a aussi eu des coups durs tu sais.
--Il ne doit pas savoir.
Juste..
--Reste un jour de plus.
--Je dois retourner ŕ San Diego demain.
--Maman, encore une chose.
--Oui?
Tu es maladroite.
Je t'aime.
Sois prudent, D'accord?
Messieurs, Le President des Etats-Unis.
On est obligé de regarder ça ?
(Old McDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O)
On a finalement trouvé un garage pour la réparer.
On a du faire un détour.
...océan de haine...
Je me sens comme si j'étais
de retour ŕ Washington.
...dans notre grand pays, et dčjŕ,
Nous savons tous que ces divisions
ne sont rien en comparaison
des dangers posés par la menace de la terreur.
Notre responsabilité éternelle
est de laisser un monde meilleur
ŕ nos enfants et ŕ nos petits enfants.
Ceci a toujours été notre promesse
et le sera toujours...
5... 4... 3... 2... 1!
Nous serons de retour d'ici une heure M. McVey.
M. McVey? Allo?
...transporté sur...
Nous avons...
Ce n'est pas marrant, Woody!
Tu dois mieux te cacher!
Woody?
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes?
Regardez! Regardez ça!
Dépčches-toi, tout de suite.
Oui, vous devriez vous dépčcher
et rentrer chez vous alors.
Oů est Cody?
Quelqun a vu Cody?
On a pas de temps ŕ perdre.
Chut.
Gail? Que ce passe t’il?
Oh, Johnston.
Rien.
Ok, l'explosion semble provenir de l'Ouest,
peut-ętre Denver.
Jimmy, prends la radio,
je veux tout le monde au bureau du Shérif.
--Je vais prendre Eric. En avant!
--D'accord.
Papa, n'y va pas!
Viens ici.
Je serais bientôt de retour, d'accord?
Johnston!
Jake!
Nous allons le trouver.
On est en train de les sortir de la mine,
cinq ŕ la fois comme toujours.
Pas besoin de déclencher une émeute.
--Vous essayez juste de reduire le temps de travail
de mes hommes!
--Arrétez tout les deux.
Norman, fais sortir tout le monde
de la mine immédiatement.
Et Shep, aide-le pour changer.
- Shérif, Chef.
- Oui.
--Des dommages, Incendies, Des bâtiments?
--Rien du tout M. le Maire.
--Ta ville se porte bien.
--Bien, esperons que vous ayez raison.
Ca veut dire quoi?
Est-ce qu'on a des compteurs Geiger?
Pardon!
Uh, pardon.
Il s'est passé quelque chose?
Bon, que dit le plan d'urgence?
Contacter le gouverneur, la garde nationale et les militaires.
--On est attaqué?
--Fils, je ne veux plus jamais entendre ce mot!
Maintenant ecoutez, ça pourrait ętre un test.
Comme ça pourrait ętre un accident.
Il y a des bases militaires prčs de Denver.
Une explosion ne veut pas forcément dire attentat.
Si nous restons calmes,
la ville reste calme, ok?
Oh.
--J'ai trouvé les compteurs Geiger.
--Merci
Oh, Gray. Content de vous voir.
--Toute aide est la bienvenue.
--Bien, merci, Johnston, Eric.
--Que puis-je faire pour vous aider?
--Nous vous le dirons.
Ca marche, Papa?
Ça a l'air oui.
M. le Maire.
--Shérif-- La bombe?
--Oui, Mme, pour l'instant
aucun signe de radiation.
--On va continuer ŕ vérifier
les alentours de la ville.
--Non. non, monsieur.
Le bus scolaire de ma fille
n'est pas rentré de leur expédition.
--Faites quelque chose!
--J'ai compris.
--Vous-vous devriez ętre en train
de chercher Stacy en ce moment.
--Oui, Mme. Mme, Teresa,
On viens juste de l'apprendre,
mais nous allons nous en occuper, d'accord?
--Ne vous inquiétez pas s'il-vous-plait.
--C'est facile ŕ dire pour vous.
Vous n'avez pas d'enfant lŕ-bas.
Bon, le bus scolaire était lŕ aux grottes.
Qui peut me dire oů ils ont pu le faire réparer?
--Il y a le garage de Wilson sur la 160.
--Ou sur Cedar Run.
Le principal Movey dit
qu'ils ont pris une déviation
avant que le telephone ne se coupe.
Je propose de faire 2 équipes.
Il y a tellement d'endroits oů ils peuvent ętre.
--Et pourquoi pas les parents?
--C'est vrai, c'est vrai.
S'il-vous-plait. S'il-vous-plait! Tout le monde.
Ecoutez, je sais que vous voulez tous y aller.
Je ne vous en veux pas.
Mais en tant qu'ami, je vous demande d'y réflčchir.
Vous ętes en sécurité ici.
Que se passerait-il, Dieu nous protčge,
vous allez lŕ-bas, vous disparaissiez,
et vos enfants deviennent orphelins.
Vous connaissez le shérif et ses hommes.
Vous savez qu'ils vont les retrouver,
alors s'il-vous-plait.
A l'aide!
Monsieur!
Monsieur, S'il vous plait!
Monsieur!
Quoi? Que se passe t'il?
Monsieur, aidez-moi!
--Monsieur, s'il-vous-plait!
--Je crois qu'ils...
Je crois qu'ils sont entrain de mourir!
Jimmy, vient par ici et calme ces gens.
Nous sommes sur la bonne fréquence monsieur,
mais c'est comme si il n'y avait personne ŕ l'extčrieur.
Bon, um...
Et avec une radio analogique?
On pourrait contacter le gouverneur avec cette radio, non?
Cela pourrait fonctionner mais ŕ ce que
je sache il n'y en a qu'une seule en ville.
J'avais peur que vous me disiez ça.
Excusez-moi Shérif?.
Robert Hawkins.
Content de vous rencontrer M. Hawkins,
mais comme vous pouvez le voir,
nous sommes trčs occupés.
Avez-vous besoin d'un coup de main?
Pas de civil. Ordre du Maire.
A l'époque j'étais un flic. Saint Louis.
--Vous connaissez les routes du coin?
--Non, je viens juste de m'installer.
Je suis désolé alors,
mais vous ne feriez que nous ralentir.
Vous pourriez avoir besoin de peinture noire?
Vous savez, pour cacher ça.
Ecoutez, je sais que vous dites aux gens que c'était un accident.
Et j'espčre que c'est ça.
Mais si c'était une attaque, Shérif,
Et que c'est le chaos lŕ-bas,
vous ne voudriez pas qu'ils sachent
que Jericho est toujours lŕ.
Avec tout mon respect, Mr. Hawkins,
Nous ne sommes pas ŕ Saint-Louis.
--Papa, tout va bien?
--Oui, je vais bien.
Ne t'inquičtes pas pour moi.
Oh, Oliver! Veux-tu arręter ça?
Désolé, Johnston.
J'ai cru que vous étiez des extra-terrestres.
Nous subissons une attaque alien, vous savez?
Si. C'est la raison pour laquelle nous sommes lŕ.
--Est-ce que tu as toujours ta radio?
--Ouais.
--Pour toi ... 50 cents.
--Oliver
J'ai besoin de ces 50 cents!
Ok.
Je vais chercher la monnaie.
Salut Dale, désolé je n'ai pas pu appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé de rester en ville
quelques jours de plus.
--Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
--Chéri, arrętes. C'est mon gamin.
--Bébé, Qu'est ce que tu regardes par la fenętre?
--Viens ici et regardes ça!
C'est quoi?
Oh mon Dieu, oh mon Dieu...
Salut Dale, désolé je n'ai pas pu appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé de rester en ville
quelques jours de plus.
--Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
--Chéri...
...mais nous avons décidé de rester
en ville quelques jours de plus.
Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
Ché... Salut Dale, désolé je n'ai pas pu
appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé...
Salut Dale, désolé je n'ai pas pu appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé de rester en ville
quelques jours de plus.
--Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
--Chéri, arrętes. C'est mon gamin.Bébé...
--Comment se fait-il que l'électricité ait été coupée?
--Je ne sais pas.
La bombe a peut-ętre grillé les relais.
--C'est possible?
--Je sais pas.
Ils ont peut-ętre fait exploser toute
la centrale électrique qu'est-ce qu'on en sait!
Hé Les gars, c'est probablement juste une fuite
sur le systčme venant de Denver.
Est-ce vous professeur de sciences?
--Robert Hawkins.
--Chef Carol.
--Hey.
--Hey.
Jimmy, Ou ętes-vous?
Willow Creek, shérif.
Il n'y a rien ici.
Le cerf est devenu fou et a commencé
ŕ courir au milieu de la route.
Ok, ne le regarde pas.
Il est vivant?
Oui.
--Ca va?
--Oui.
Je crois que ma jambe est cassée.
--Pouvez-vous sentir vos orteils?
--Oui.
Ne vous inquiétez pas pour moi.
Inquiétez-vous plutôt pour eux.
Quelqu'un est-il blessé?
Quelqu’un?
Stacy est malade.
Elle ne peut pas respirer.
Pourquoi?
Que s'est-il passé?
Quand le bus s'est arręté,
Elle était comme ça.
Tout va bien Stacy, laisse moi jeter un oeil.
Tu me laisse regarder?
Je peux voir?
Laisse moi jeter un oeil Stacy.
Tout va bien. Tout va bien.
Vous avez de la glace?
Nous devons arręter le gonflement maintenant.
Lucas, le kit de premiers soins est sous le sičge.
Tu vas bien.
Aller, tout va bien.
Contentes-toi de respirer.
Respire normalement, ok?
Ca va. Ca va. Tu vas bien.
Continue ŕ respirer normalement.
Ok. Tu vas bien.
Tu vas bien.
S'il te plait...
Calme-toi. Calme-toi.
Hey, Stacy!
Non, non, non!
Réfléchis! Réfléchis!
Réfléchis!
Ok.
Ecoutez, j'ai besoin de l'aide de tout le monde ici.
Quelqu'un a un stylo?
Qui?
Quelqu'un a t’il un stylo?
j'ai besoin d'un stylo.
--Nous avons des feutres.
--Non, j'ai besoin d'un tube.
Quelque chose de creux, hum..
Une paille.
--J'ai une paille.
--Ok, laisse-moi voir.
Aller, fais-moi voir!
Non, c'est trop fin.
Quelqu'un d'autre a un jus de fruit?
--Moi.
--Ok, sortez-les tous.
Sors-moi le sparadrap.
--Comment tu t'appelles?
--Julie.
Ok, donnez tous vos pailles ŕ Julie.
Vite, dépęchez-vous!
Faites un rond avec!
Ok, c'est bon?
On y est, accroche-les ensemble avec le sparadrap.
Aller Stacy! Aller!
Qui est le plus fort ici?
Toi. J'ai besoin que tu maintiennes ses épaules,
au cas oů elle se réveille, d'accord?
Ne regarde pas.
Oů sont mes pailles, Julie?
Aller! Aller!
Respire pour moi, okai? S'il te plait.
Aller, Aller.
Attends! Je vois quelque chose.
--Okay. Okay, On voit le bus.
--Super.
--Vous avez besoin de nous?
--Non, continuez de chercher Jake.
Allons-y les gars.
Comment avez-vous appris ŕ faire ça?
Ecole Militaire.
Vous étiez un soldat?
Non, j'ai raté.
Shérif!
Shérif, Regardez ça!
Ce n'est pas le bon bus!
Riley? Riley, viens par ici!
Riley!
Génial!
Oů est cette putain d'équipe de sauvetage?
Oh, bonsoir Dale.
Aller viens, Rentre chéri.
Viens, on essaie de tous de surmonter
cette épreuve ensemble.
Salut, Dale.
Tout va bien Chéri?
C'est quoi ça?
C'est ma mčre.
Salut Dale, désolée je n'ai pas pu appeler plutôt mon ange,
mais nous avons décidé de rester en ville quelques jours de plus.
--Pose ce téléphone et vient au lit.
--Chéri, arrętes. C'est mon gamin.
Bébé, qu'est ce que tu regardes par la fenętre?
Viens ici et regarde ça!
C'est quoi?
Oh mon Dieu, oh mon Dieu...
Oh, Dale. Je suis tellement désolée.
Je ne savais pas que ta mčre était ŕ Denver.
Elle n'était pas ŕ Denver.
Elle était ŕ Atlanta.
Oh mon Dieu!
Je suis sűre qu'ils auront des réponses.
Oh mon Dieu!
Comment va t'elle?
Nous devons la ramener.
Ici, Ici.
Melle Lisinski. Est-ce qu'on aura école demain?
On verra ma puce.
Je vote non.
Dale. Dale, qu'est-ce que tu fais chéri?
S'il te plait. Ne prends rien!
Dale!
--Pręt?
--Oui, Oui.
Hey, Il y en a encore lŕ-bas?
Premier arrivé, premier servis.
Tu as déjŕ remplis ton camion,
tu vas tondre ta pelouse aussi?
--J'ai une famille tu sais.
--On a tous une famille.
S'il-te-plait.
Enlčve tes mains de ce bidon!
Aller!
Oů tu crois lŕ, hein?
--Qu'est-ce que vous faites?
--Quel est le problčme?
D'accord, tout le monde s'assoit.
Vite.
La nourriture ne va pas pourrir
tant que le temps restera frais.
En espérant que le courant soit rétabli d'ici lŕ.
Merci pour tout, Dale.
Pas de problčme, m'dame.
--Eloignes-toi de la voiture!
--Sors de la voiture.
--Hey! Hey! Arrętez!
--Séparez-vous!
Dégage.
Vous avez besoin de mettre un peu de lumiere.
Avant que vous ne commenciez ŕ perdre des personnes.
Tout ce que nous avons ce sont des lanternes
et des lampes de poche.
Ca ne suffira pas ŕ éclairer la rue.
Mais votre ville répare les routes la nuit non?
Excuse-moi!
--Votre machine ne fonctionne pas.
--Tu vas devoir payer en cash.
Vous ętes sűr que vous n'ętes pas professeur de sciences?
Chef, on a un petit problčme ici ŕ la station d'essence.
On a besoin de votre aide tout de suite.
--J'arrive.
--Je m'en occupe.
--Je viens avec vous.
--Ok, merci.
Monsieur...
Nous avons un problčme ŕ la station d'essence.
Grande foule.
On dirait qu'il y a des problčmes.
Nous avons besoin de votre aide ici.
--Papa!
--J'ai entendu.
En avant!
--Sara?
--Tout va bien.
Chéri?
Je n'ai pas le temps maintenant.
--Des idiots ont...
--Johnston.
--Quoi?
--Ecoute moi.
La mčre de Dale Turner est morte ce soir
dans une autre explosion.
Atlanta.
Oh mon Dieu.
Shérif?
Il n'y a aucun signe de Jake ici.
En fait il n'y a aucun signe de qui que ce soit.
Nous allons...
Nous allons rentrer.
Tenez-moi au courant si les enfants
ont besoin de quelque chose.
Shérif, vous ętes lŕ?
Reste éveillé,
reste éveillé, ne...
Est-ce que ce bus a un bidon d'essence?
Si le bus...
s'arręte...
Okay.
Les enfants, écoutez-moi.
Si le bus s'arręte encore,
Vous devrez marcher jusqu'ŕ la ville.
et ramener de l'aide, okay?
Je ne sais pas oů nous sommes.
Quand vous arriverez au panneau STOP,
tournez ŕ gauche, Ok?
Prenez ŕ gauche.
C'est oů la gauche?
Mettez vos mains en l'air...
Et dépliez vos pouces.
Celle qui forme un "L"
Voilŕ votre gauche.
Dégages tes mains de moi!
Fais quelque chose, veux-tu?
County Edwards! Carl! Carl!
Arrętez immédiatement!
Oui Morty c'est ŕ toi que je parles!
Michael Stevenson.
Carl Meeks... Carl!
Pourquoi vous disputez-vous?
Vous vous volez entre voisins?
Vous vous battez contre les mauvaises personnes.
Nous sommes complčtement dans le noir.
Tout ce que je dis c'est que je pense
qu'il faut qu'on s'organise.
Je...
Je ne sais pas oů est le Maire,
Mais peut-ętre il serait peut-ętre temps
qu'on élabore un plan nous-męmes.
Que ce passe t’il Gray?
On fait des discours maintenant?
Avec tout votre respect monsieur le Maire,
Nous avons un bus manquant,
pas de police
et des pompiers faisant le travail des flics.
--Comment osez-vous faire de la politique maintenant?
--Eric. Eric.
Je ne parle pas ŕ mon adversaire,
mais au Maire.
Je me fous des élections,
je cherche ŕ survivre.
Il se peut que nous soyons les seuls survivants,
Et j'ai besoin de savoir ce que mon Maire compte faire.
Ecoutez, je sais qu'on a dű endurer beaucoup ce soir.
Mais je vais vous dire quelque chose.
J'ai été dans des grandes villes.
J'ai été dans des pays étrangers,
mais ŕ choisir, je choisirais les gens...
...les gens de Jericho, entre toute autre ville.
Nous sommes au courant Mr le Maire,
nous avons déjŕ entendu votre discours.
Bien, Shep, j'espčre que vous ne pensez pas
que je m'étais assoupi au pupitre.
Nous avons tous espéré que ce soit un accident.
Mais la triste vérité est
qu'une autre explosion a eu lieu ŕ Atlanta.
--Comment?
--Oh mon Dieu.
--J'ai essayé de contacter le gouverneur.
--Oui? Bien, mais si le gouverneur était mort?
Il n'y a aucun rapport sur le fait
qu'il ce soit passé quelque chose ŕ Topeka.
--Comment allons nous avoir des rapport sans télévision?
--Ou de téléphones?
Et New York?
--Nous ne savons rien ŕ propos de New York.
--Quand est-ce que le courant va ętre rétabli?
--Est-ce que l'eau est potable?
--Une ŕ la fois, s'il-vous-plait.
--Calmez-vous.
--Se calmer? Mon garçon est toujours lŕ-bas.
Le Shérif est actuellement lŕ-bas
ŕ la recherche de votre fils et de mon fils.
Et si on avait plus d'officiers de police lŕ-bas?
--Nous devons savoir ce que vous avez prévu de faire.
--Personne ne peut répondre ŕ ça.
Aidez-les! Aidez-les!
C'est Stacy.
Hey, toi, petite.
--Tu vas bien?
--Je m'occupe de toi.
Comment vous appelez vous?
--Heather.
--Jake
--Heureuse de vous rencontrer Jake.
--Moi aussi.
Maman!
--Tu m'as tellement manqué.
--Je t'aime.
Hey, mon chéri!
Papa, il y avait ce cerf...
Maman est juste lŕ.
Je suis lŕ ma chérie.
Tout va bien se passer.
--Jake.
--M'man
--Ton visage!
--Ca va aller.
--Oh, Chéri.
--Ca va?
Oui, bien sur.
Eric, Aide ton frčre.
--Passes ton bras autour de moi.
- Fait attention! Fait attention!
Doucement. Doucement.
Ok.
--Eric, Prends April. On se voit au centre médical.
--Ok.
Hey, Hey , il y a un bus de prisonnier vide lŕ-bas.
--Vers oů?
--Cedar Run.
D'accord, détends-toi.
Je m'en occupe.
--Dieu! Regardes-toi, tu es amoché.
--Ca va.
--Arręte de t'inqičter pour moi.
--Et bien, compte pas dessus.
Hey, Shep!
Vous avez dit avant que vous aviez déjŕ entendu mon discours.
Vous vous ętes déjŕ demandé pourquoi je l'ai dit?
Car j'ai confiance en vous!
Car j'aime ma ville.
Aujourd'hui quelque chose s'est passé ŕ Denver et Atlanta
et il est possible que l'on se réveille
et qu'on découvre que ça s'arręte lŕ.
Mais jusqu'ŕ ce que nous soyons sűrs,
Allons-nous utiliser notre imagination
pour résoudre les problčmes
ou pour les creer?
Quand on aura rétabli le courant
on pourra découvrir l'étendue de cette chose.
S'il le faut, nous pouvons combattre.
Nous pouvons combattre n'importe qui.
Nous pouvons battres tous nos ennemis.
La seule façon pour que ça marche
c'est si nous travaillons ensemble.
Maintenant, rentrez chez vous.
On se voit demain ŕ la Mairie.
Et s'il-vous-plait...
ne me faites plus jamais ça.
Chef, que tous vos hommes gardent
leurs positions jusqu'au retour du Shérif.
Hey... Shep.
J'ai eu peur de ne plus jamais te revoir.
Aller. Tu crois que j'aurais laissé
papa avoir le dernier mot?
Hey.
Assez parlé de moi.
Tu as fait quelque chose de grand ce soir.
Merci.
Ton grand-pčre aurait été fier.
Je vais voir ce qu'il leur prend autant de temps.
Tu sais , je pars pendant quelques années
et la ville tombe en enfer.
Je suis content que tu sois rentré.
Ouais, on verra.
A quoi vous pensez?
Je me demandais juste ŕ quoi tout ça
va ressembler demain matin.
(I'll sing it one last time for you)
(Then we really have to go)
(You've been the only thing that's right)
(In all I've done...)
Qu'est-ce qui ce passe?
(Light up, light up)
(As if you have a choice)
(even if you cannot hear... )

(Is there room for one more son?)
(One more son)
(If you can hold on)
(If you can hold on...)
(hold on)
(I wanna stand up,)
(I wanna let go)

...is high on Capital Hill
as an emergency session of Congress
prepares to hear the President address the issue
of global violence.
Recent attacks have pushed this administration
to take extreme action
raising more fears than it's alleviated.
With global tension rising,
the President is taking a risky step
by confronting what some political observers...
Oh, I can't believe it.
Jake Green.
How you doing, man?
--When did you get back to town?
--Just now.
Is that Bonnie?
You grew up.
Wait a minute, where the hell you been?
You know, around.
--Jake, no one's been around for five years.
--The Army.
--I've been in the Army.
--Good for you.
--Who's that?
--She's from the IRS.
--IRS? Audit IRS?
--Yeah.
--Not going well?
--No. Forget it.
How about you and I, we go out
tonight and we catch up?
I'd love to, but I just came in
to see my grandfather, and
--I've got to get back, so...
--Okay.
Bonnie.
Bonnie, we need a pie.
One strawberry rhubarb.
Welcome back to Jericho, Jake.
His wife is lovely,
but I don't know about him.
Mrs. Olsen made me promise not to tell,
but she heard that he bought the old Thompson
place in cash.
Cash.
--That color looks really good on you.
--I know.
--Why didn't your mom take you to New York?
--'Cause she hates me.
What are you looking at, loser?
I could be shopping in SoHo right now
instead of Gracie's Market.
--I know. Look at this thing--
--so ugly.
--Promise not to tell?
--Promise, Mrs. Leigh.
What about you, Jake?
Where have you been keeping yourself?
I've been playing minor league baseball.
Oh, is that a fact?
Well...
when do you get in from Chicago?
All right.
Good. I'll pick you up.
I love you, too.
--Hey.
--Sorry, hi. Um...
What are you doing here?
I just came in for the day to visit my grandfather,
--see the family.
--Yeah, of course, sure.
--I just didn't hear.
--Anyway, how you been?
Mom tells me you're teaching at the high school now.
--Yeah, it's weird, huh?
--Yeah.
I love it.
I just bought a house in the Pines.
The East Side on a teacher's salary?
Uh, my-my fianc?
he's in banking, so...
--Oh, that helps.
--Yeah, Roger really loves it here.
Well, I'm happy for you, Emily.
--How about you, you got somebody?
--No.
--I'm sorry, I shouldn't...
--No, you're not, you love it.
--Where have you been?
--The Navy.
Oh, why do I even bother?
Seriously...
where have you been?
(And you ask me what I want this year)
(And I try to make this kind and clear)
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days )
('Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings)
(And desire and love and empty things)
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days)
(So take these words..)
Oh, Jake!
Oh, honey!
--Oh, you're home!
--You're choking me, Mom.
I thought I heard an annoying voice.
--Hey, brother.
--Good to see you.
('Cause tonight's the night the world begins again.)
I'm not here to interfere with your campaign, Dad.
All  I want is your signature,
then I'll visit Grandpa...
After five years, Jake,
that's all you have to say to Dad?
--It's none of your business, Eric.
--It is his business, it is all our business.
--What you put this family through...
--Johnston. For god's sake.
--Now, he could've been...
--We could spend a week talking about what
I could've been, all right?
I've  apologized.
I've made amends.
This is me now.
--I have a plan, but I need my money to make a clean start.
--It's not your money,
--it's your grandfather's money.
--I know, but he gave it to me for a reason.
And he gave me authority over it for a reason.
--You convince me you're leading a more
productive life and then...
--That's right, Jake.
We  were both born on third base.
Quit pretending you hit a triple.
--Now, when are you going to realize
I'm 32-years-old.
--When you do.
Can I talk to my mayor then, huh?
Let's go see your grandfather.
--I just...
--Stop it, Jake.
--The one thing I can't...
--You would have been here if you could.
I brought money.
--Here.
--I can't, Mom.
--I'll talk to your father.
--He doesn't get it.
--Because you won't tell him
why you really need the money.
--Mom.
You don't give him enough credit.
--Your dad's had a few trials of his own, you know?
--He can never know.
Just...
--Stay one more day.
--I got to get back to San Diego by tomorrow.
--Mom, one more thing.
--Hmm?
You have clumsy hands.
I love you.
Be careful now, okay?
Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.
Do I have to watch this?
(Old McDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O)
Yeah, well, we finally found
a garage where we can fix it.
We had to take a detour.
...ocean of hatred...
Feel like I'm back in D.C.
...in our great nation, and yet,
we all know that these divisions
pale in comparison
to the fundamental dangers
posed by the threat of terror.
We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world
a better place for our children and grandchildren.
This has always been our promise and this
will always...
Five, four, three, two, one.
We'll be back in an hour, Mr. McVey.
Mr. McVey? Hello?
...carried on...
We have...
No fun, Woody.
You have to hide better!
Woody?
What are you looking at?
Look! Look it!
Hurry on there right now.
Yeah, you better hurry up and get on home then.
Where's Cody?!
Has anyone seen Cody?
We haven't got time.
Shh.
Gail, what's going on?
Oh, Johnston.
Nothing.
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west,
maybe Denver.
Jimmy, get on the radio.
I want everybody at the sheriff's station.
--I'll pick up Eric. Let's move.
--All right.
Dad, don't leave.
Come here.
I'll be back real soon, all right?
Johnston.
Jake.
We'll find him.
We're bringing them out of the mine,
five at a time like always.
No need to start a panic.
--You're just trying to get another
hour's work out of my men!
--Stop it, the both of you.
Norman, get everybody out of the mine immediately.
And Shep, help him for a change.
--Sheriff? Chief?
--Yeah?
--Damage, fires, buildings?
--Nothing, Mr. Mayor.
--The town's fine.
--Well, let's hope you're right.
What does that mean?
Do we have any Geiger counters?
Excuse me?
Uh, excuse me.
Did something happen?
So, what does the emergency plan say?
Contact the governor, National Guard
and state troopers.
--Are we under attack?
--Son, I don't want to hear that word again.
Now look, this could have been a test.
It could have been an accident.
There's, uh, military bases near Denver.
One explosion does not make an attack.
If we stay calm,
the town stays calm, okay?
Oh.
--I found the Geiger counters.
--Thanks.
Oh, Grey, good to see you.
--We can use the extra help.
--Well, thank you, Johnston, Eric.
--Well, what can I do to help?
--We'll let you know.
Does it work, Dad?
Looks okay.
Mr. Mayor.
--Sheriff-- the bomb?
--Yes, ma'am, so far there's no sign
of any radiation.
--We'll keep checking around town.
--No. No, sir.
The school bus isn't back from
the field trip with my daughter.
--Well, do something!
--I got it.
--You-You should be out there looking for Stacy.
--Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, Teresa,
this is the first we've heard of it,
but we will deal with it, all right?
--Just please don't worry.
--That's easy for you to say.
You don't have a child out there.
So the school bus was here at the caves.
Now, who can tell me where they might have
gone for repairs?
--Well, there's Wilson's garage off 160.
--Or Cedar Run Road.
Principal Movey said they took a detour
before the phone cut out.
Well, I figure two teams.
There's only so many places they could be.
--Now, what about the parents?
--Right, right.
Folks. Folks! Folks.
Now,  look, I know that every part of you
wantsto just rush out there.
I don't blame you.
But as your friend, I'm asking you to
think about that.
You're safe here.
Now, what if, God forbid,
you go out there, and you get stranded,
and your child comes back an orphan?
You know the sheriff and his men.
You know they'll find your kids, so please.
Help!
Mister!
Mister, please!
Mister!
What? What is it?
Mister, help!
--Mister, please!
--I think they're...
I think they're dying!
That's fine.
Let's go find out.
Jimmy, get over there and calm those folks down.
Hey, Pete, come on!
We have our frequencies, sir,
but outside, it's like there's no one there.
All right, um...
what about analog?
We could contact the governor
with a Ham radio, couldn't we?
That could work, but there's only one in town
that I know of.
I was afraid you were going to say that.
Excuse me, Sheriff?
Robert Hawkins.
Well, it's good to meet you, Mr. Hawkins,
but as you can see, we've got our hands full.
Could you use an extra man?
No civilians, mayor's orders.
But I used to be a cop-- St. Louis.
--Do you know the roads around here?
--No, just moved to town.
Then I'm afraid you'd just slow us down,
I'm sorry.
You might want to get some black spray paint.
You know, cover that?
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident,
and I hope it was,
but if it was an attack, Sheriff,
and there's chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people knowing
that Jericho is still here.
With all due respect, Mr. Hawkins,
this is not St. Louis.
--Dad, are you okay?
--Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.
Oh, Oliver, would you stop that?
Sorry, Johnston.
Thought you were aliens.
Well, we're under attack by aliens, don't you know?
Yes, we do. That's why we're here.
--Do you have your Ham radio?
--Yeah.
--For you, 50 cents.
--Oliver.
--Well, I need my 50 cents.
--Okay.
Let me get you change.
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel
but we decided to stay in the city
an extra couple of days.
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that. It's my kid.
--Baby, what are you staring at out the window?
--Get over here and look at this!
What-What is that?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel,
but we decided to stay in the city
an extra couple of days.
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey...
...but we decided to stay in
the city an extra couple days.
Put down the phone and come to bed.
Hon... Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel
but we decided...
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel
but  we decided to stay in
the city an extra couple days.
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that. It's my kid. Baby...
--How could we lose power?
--I don't know.
Bomb could have fried the relays.
--That's possible.
--Maybe.
They could've blown up the power station for all we know.
Guys, it was probably just a drain on
the system from Denver.
You a science teacher?
--Robert Hawkins.
--Chief Carroll.
--Hey.
--Hey.
Jimmy, what's your 20?
Willow Creek, Sheriff.
There is nothing in sight.
The deer went crazy and started running
all over the road.
All right, just don't look at it.
Is he alive?
Yeah.
--Are you okay?
--Yeah.
I think my leg is broken.
--Can you feel your toes?
--Yeah.
Don't worry about me.
Worry about them.
Is anybody hurt?
Huh? Anybody?
Stacy's sick.
She can't breathe.
What's wrong?
What happened?
When the bus stopped,
she was like this.
It's okay, Stacy, let me see.
Let me see it?
Can I see?
Let me just see, Stacy.
It's okay. It's okay.
Do you have an ice pack?
We've got to stop the swelling now.
Lucas, the first aid kit is under the seat.
You're okay.
Come on, it's all right.
Just keep breathing.
Breathe normally, all right?
It's okay. It's okay, you're fine.
Just keep breathing normally.
Okay, you're okay.
You're okay.
Please.
Calm down, calm down.
Hey? Hey, Stacy?
No, no, no. No.
Think. Think.
Think.
All right.
Look, I need everyone's help right now.
Who has a pen?
Does anyone?
Does anybody have a pen?
All right, I need a pen.
--We have pencils.
--No, I need a tube.
Something hollow, um...
A straw.
--I have a straw.
--Here, let me see it.
Let me see it, come on.
That's too thin.
Does anyone else have a juice box?
--I do!
--All right, get them out, get them out.
Get some Band-Aids out.
--What's your name?
--Julie.
All right, everybody give your straws to Julie.
Okay? Hurry, quick.
Make them into a circle.
All right, you got that?
There you go, now tape them
together with those Band-Aids.
Come on, Stacy.
All right, who's the strongest kid?
You. I need you to hold her shoulders down,
in case she wakes up. All right?
Don't look.
Where's my straws?
Come on, come on.
Breathe for me, okay? Please?
Come on. Come on.
Wait,  I see something.
--Okay, okay, we see the bus.
--Uh, good.
--You want us?
--No, no, you keep looking for Jake.
Let's get down there, boys.
How'd you learn how to do that?
Uh, military school.
Were you a soldier?
No, a screw up.
Sheriff.
Sheriff, look at this.
It's the wrong bus!
Riley, Riley get over here!
Riley!
Oh, great.
Where's the damn rescue party?
Oh, hi, Dale.
Come on in, honey.
Come on, we're all trying
to get through this together.
Hi, Dale.
You okay, honey?
What you got there?
It's my mom.
Hi, Dale, sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel
but we decided to stay in the
city an extra couple days.
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that, it's my kid.
Baby, what are you staring at out the window?
Get over here and look at this!
What, what is that?
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, Dale, I am so sorry.
I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
She wasn't in Denver.
She was in Atlanta.
Oh, my God.
I'm sure that they'll have some answers.
Oh, my God.
How is she?
We have to get her back.
Right here. Right here.
Miss Lisinski, are we going to
have school tomorrow?
We'll figure it out, honey.
I vote no.
Dale, Dale, what are you doing, honey?
Please, please don't steal from me.
Dale!
--Ready?
--Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you got extra there?
First come, first serve.
You filled up your truck, you
going to mow your lawn, too?
--I've got a family, you know?
--We've all got families.
Come on.
Get your hand off the can.
Come on.
What do you think you're doing, hmm?
--What are you doing?
--What's your problem?
All right, everybody sit down.
Hurry.
Food won't go rotten as long
as the weather stays cool.
Hopefully the power will be fixed by then.
Thank you for this, Dale.
Anything for you, ma'am.
--Step away from the car.
--Get out of the car.
--Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on,
--break it up.
Get off.
You need to get some lights on
before people start losing it.
All we have is lanterns and flashlights.
That's not enough to light up
the street though.
But your town does roadwork at night, right?
Excuse me.
--The machine doesn't work.
--Well, you guys have to pay cash or something!
You sure you're not the science teacher?
Chief, we got a little problem
down here at the gas station.
We need your help right away.
--I'm on my way.
--I got this.
--I'll come with you.
--All right, thanks.
Sir.
Something's going on at the gas station.
Big crowd.
Looks like trouble.
Gonna need help down here.
--Dad.
--I heard.
Go, go.
--Sara?
--It's okay.
Honey?
I don't have time right now.
--Some damn fool...
--Johnston.
--What?
--Listen to me.
Dale Turner's mother died
tonight in another explosion.
Atlanta.
Oh, my God.
Sheriff?
Yeah, there's no sign of Jake out here
in fact, there's, uh, no sign of anybody.
We're going to,
we're going to head back.
Let me know if the kids need anything
Sheriff, you there?
Stay awake.
Stay awake, don't--
Does this bus have a gas can?
If the bus...
If it stops...
Okay.
Kids, listen to me.
If the bus stops again,
we're going to need you to walk back to town
and get help, okay?
I don't know where we are.
When we get to the stop sign,
turn left, all right?
Take a left.
Which way is left?
Hold up your hands...
stick out your thumbs.
The one that makes the L,
that's your left.
Get your hands off me!
Do something, will you?
County Edwards! Carl! Carl!
Stop it right now!
Yeah, Morty, I'm talking to you!
Michael Stevenson.
Carl Meeks... Carl!
Why are you turning on each other?
Stealing from your neighbors?
You are fighting the wrong people!
We are literally in the dark.
All I'm saying is that I-I think
we need to get organized.
I...
I don't know where the mayor is,
but maybe it's time we came up
with a plan ourselves.
What's going on, Gray?
We making speeches?
With all due respect, Mr. Mayor
we have a missing bus,
no police,
firemen doing policemen's job.
--How dare you politicize it!
--Eric. Eric.
I'm not talking to my opponent
I'm talking to my mayor.
Now, I don't care about the election
I care about survival.
We just might be on our own here,
and I need to know what my mayor intends to do!
Folks, I know we've been through a lot tonight.
I want to tell you something.
I've been to big cities and
I've been to foreign countries,
--but I will take the good people of--
--The good people of Jericho
over any other city
we know, Mr. Mayor, we've heard the speech.
Well, Shep, I hope you don't think
I've been asleep at the switch.
We had all hoped this was an accident
but the unfortunate truth is
there was another explosion in Atlanta.
--What?
--Oh, my God.
--I been busy trying to contact the governor.
--Yeah? Well, what if the governor's dead?
There is no report of anything happening in Topeka.
--How are we going to get reports
without television?
--Or no phones?
What about New York?
--We don't know anything about New York.
--When are we going to get the power back on?
--Is the drinking water okay?
--One at a time, please.
--Calm down.
--Calm down? My boy is still out there.
The sheriff is out there right now
looking for your boy and my boy.
What if we had more police officers out there?
--We need to know what you're going to do now.
--No one can answer that.
Help them! Help them!
It's Stacy.
Hey, there, little one.
--You're okay.
--I got you.
What's your name?
--Heather.
--Jake.
--Nice to meet you, Jake.
--You, too.
Mommy!
--I missed you so much.
--I love you.
Hey, Buddy.
Dad, there was this deer...
Mommy's right here.
I'm right here, honey.
Everything's going to be okay.
--Jake.
--Mom.
--Oh, your face.
--I'll be all right.
--Oh, honey.
--You okay?
Of course.
Eric, help your brother.
--Put your arm around me.
--Careful. Careful.
Easy. Easy.
Okay.
--Eric, get April.
We'll meet you the medical center.
--Okay.
Hey, hey, there's an empty
prison bus out there.
--Whereabouts?
--Cedar Run.
All right, just relax.
I'll take care of it.
--God! Look at you. You're a mess.
--It's fine.
--Stop worrying about me.
--Well, good luck with that.
Hey, Shep?
You said earlier that you had
heard that speech before.
Ever ask yourself why I say it?
'Cause I happen to trust you people.
'Cause I love my town.
Now, something happened in Denver, in Atlanta,
and it could be that we wake up
and we find out that's where it stopped.
But, until we know,
are we going to use our imaginations
to solve problems
or to cause them?
We can find out how big this thing is.
If we have to, we can fight.
We can fight anybody.
We can fight all enemies.
The only way that's going to happen
is if we work together.
Now, go on home.
We'll meet tomorrow at the town hall.
And, folks,
don't you break my heart again.
Chief, keep all the men at their posts
until the sheriff gets back.
Hey, Shep.
I was afraid I was never going
to see you again.
Come on. You think I'd
let Dad have the last word?
Hey.
Quit talking about me.
You did a great thing out there tonight.
Thanks.
Your grandfather would have been proud.
I'm going to go see what's
taking these guys so long.
You know, I go away for a few years
and the town goes to hell.
I'm glad you're home.
Yeah, we'll see.
What are you thinking?
I was just wondering what it was all going
to look like in the morning.
(I'll sing it one last time for you)
(Then we really have to go)
(You've been the only thing that's right)
(In all I've done...)
What's happening?
(Light up, light up)
(As if you have a choice)
(even if you cannot hear... )

Précédemment dans Jéricho...
Jake Green !
Comment vas-tu mec ?
Attends un peu...
- Mais où étais-tu passé ?
- Dans les parages...
Jake, personne ne reste
"dans les parages" pendant 5 ans !
Sérieusement,
où étais-tu passé ?
Hé, mon frère !
Par ce que tu as
mis cette famille...
- Johnston, pour l'amour de Dieu !
- Maintenant, il pourrait avoir été...
Nous pourrions passer une semaine à
parler de ce que j'aurais pu être, d'accord ?
Je me suis excusé, mais j'ai besoin
de mon argent pour tout recommencer...
Ce n'est pas ton argent !
C'est l'argent de ton grand-père
Reste un jour de plus !
Je dois rentrer à San
Diego avant demain
Ok, il semblerait que l'explosion
vienne de l'ouest, peut-être Denver
Est-ce que quelque
chose est arrivé ?
Sommes-nous attaqués ?
Bonjour Dale.  Pardon de ne pas t'avoir
appelée plus tôt mon ange, mais nous...
Oh mon Dieu !
Oh mon Dieu !!
Shérif ?
Robert Hawkins
Je suis vraiment navrée !
Je ne savais pas que
ta mère était à Denver...
Elle n'était pas à Denver...
Elle était à Atlanta !
Oh mon Dieu !
Ecoutez, je sais que vous dites
aux gens que c'était un accident
Mais si c'était une
attaque, shérif !
Et c'est le
chaos là-dehors
Vous ne voulez peut-être
pas que les gens sachent
Que Jéricho
est toujours là !
C'est le mauvais bus !
Riley !!
Contacte April...
Il y a un bus carcéral
vide là-dehors
Comment vous
appelez-vous ?
Heather
Ravi de vous
connaître, Jack !
C'est super ce que
tu as fais là ce soir !
Merci !
Quelque chose s'est
produit à Denver, Atlanta...
Et il se pourrait que
nous nous réveillions
Et nous découvrions
où cela s'est arrêté
Mais, jusqu'à ce
que nous sachions...
Allons-nous utiliser nos imaginations
pour résoudre les problèmes
Ou pour les causer ?

JERICHO
Saison 1 - Episode 02
" Fallout "
Y a t il un signe quelconque
du shérif, M. Hawkins ?
Non, monsieur !
J'ai besoin de parler à votre Maire.
Nous avons des ennuis qui arrivent !
Oh, mon Dieu !
Maman, où se trouve April ?
- Jake, où étais-tu passé ?
- Où est-elle ?
Elle est au bout du couloir.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Contacte papa avec la radio
Vous serez plus mobile avec ça.
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
Je me sens comme une empotée !
April, la clinique a-t-elle un abri anti-atomique ?
Oui, que se passe-t-il ?
C'est mauvais, viens !
Jéricho possède deux abris anti-atomiques.
L'un juste ici, sous la Mairie,
L'autre, sous le centre médical.
Qu'en est il des sous-sols et des caves anti-tempête ?
Ils sont mieux que rien !
Mais vous devez isoler le reste de la maison.
Avec euh... du scotch, des bâches en plastique...
Tout ce sur quoi vous pourrez mettre la main !
Comment savez-vous tout ça sur les radiations, M. Hawkins ?
Parce que j'étais policier à Saint Louis.
Et depuis le 11 septembre, nous avons du monter en régime !
Notre plus grand problème pourrait être la pluie.
La pluie ne dégagera-t-elle pas les radiations de l'air ?
Oui, et l'apportera directement sur Jéricho.
Une salve directe et concentrée.
N'importe qui exposé trop longtemps...
M. le Maire ?
Monsieur ?
Ok, écoutez !  Nous allons
diviser la ville en deux secteurs.
Chacun ici peut aller à l'abri de la Mairie.
Tout ceux du côté du nord iront à la clinique.
Nous allons faire passer le message, papa !
Combien de temps avant que les radiations n'arrivent ici ?
Oh, je ne suis pas d'ici !
C'est votre ville !
Combien de temps met normalement
une tempête pour arriver depuis Denver ?
- Moins de deux heures...
- C'est juste !
Deux heures ?
Nous ne pouvons pas faire cela
en deux heures !  Pas assez de temps !
Nous avons du pain sur la planche les gars !
Jake et moi jouions ici quand nous étions gosses.
Je ne pense pas que, qui que
ce soit, soit descendu ici en dix ans.
Combien de personnes peuvent tenir ici ?
Trois cents.
Vous savez qu'il y a presque
cinq milles personnes dans cette ville.
- Eric ?
- Oui ?
Assure-toi que toutes les personnes qui ont
des sous-sols les utilisent !
Nous ne sortirons pas aujourd'hui, compris ?
Compris, papa !
Jimmy !
C'était quand la dernière fois...
Que quelqu'un est venu ici ?
C'est une plaisanterie !
Je ne peux pas mettre de gens là-dedans !
Il n'y a pas d'air...
Il n'y a pas d'air là-dedans !
J'espère que la ventilation fonctionne.
Nous avons beaucoup de boulot.
Attendez, attendez !!
Hé, hé !
Oh, merci mon Dieu !
Je n'ai vu personne depuis des heures !
Je suis tombé en panne d'essence !
Il y a des oiseaux morts tout au long de la route...
Ouais, nous les avons vus aussi,
Ils ont du volé à travers les radiations.
Quelles radiations ?
Il y avait un nuage en forme de champignon !
Quelqu'un nous a atomisé !
Oh, mon Dieu !
Ecoutez mademoiselle, nous sommes à court d'essence,
savez-vous s'il y a une station par ici ?
Vous pensez que c'est quoi .... ?
que c'est un accident ou... ?
M'dame, nous ne le savons pas encore !
Ok...
Cela venait-il de Wichita ?
- Parce que mon fiancé, il vole depuis...
- Non non, mauvaise direction, cela venait plus de Denver.
Oh mon Dieu...
Ecoutez, nous avons besoin d'essence.
Savez-vous s'il y a une station prêt d'ici  ?
Ouais, non !
Non, les pompes sont...
Elles ne fonctionnent pas !
Elles ont toutes été abandonnées...
Non, nous... nous pourrions essayer le Ranch Richmond.
Ils devraient avoir de l'essence là-bas !
Montez alors, nous vous y emmenons.
Mademoiselle !
C'est bon !
Montez !
Dale ?
Réveille-toi.
Réveille-toi, mon ange.
Maman ?
Tu ne te rappelle pas, ce qui s'est passé la nuit dernière ?
Ta mère est partie.
Gracie ?
Allez Gracie ! Ouvre !
Gracie, nous devons stocker de la nourriture dans les abris !
<i>Attention ! Attention  !</i>
<i>Il y a des retombées radioactives provenant du souffle nucléaire.</i>
<i>Vous avez moins de 90 minutes pour rentrer à l'intérieur !</i>
<i>Je répète, vous avez moins de
90 minutes pour rentrer à l'intérieur.</i>
<i>Utilisez vos sous-sols.</i>
<i>Utilisez du scotch ou toute adhésif
pour cloisonner votre maison.</i>
<i>Vous avez moins de 90 minutes !</i>
<i>Vous pouvez aller à l'abri de la Mairie.</i>
<i>Ou à l'abri du centre médical.</i>
<i>Il y a des retombées radioactives qui arrivent.</i>
<i>Vous avez 90 minutes pour vous mettre à l'abris.</i>
Nous sommes à l'intérieur !
Tu n'es pas du coin, n'est-ce pas ?
Je suis venu de Washington pour
diriger un petit audit sur une ferme.
Dieu me punit-il ?
Ecoutez, vous devriez vraiment
aller au sous-sol de la Mairie.
Tu le pense ?
Jake, je ne vais nulle part !
Maman... maman !
Maman, je ne veux pas discuter avec toi.
- Vas à l'autre abris
- Je reste !
Maman !  Je ne sais même pas si nous pouvons le réparer,
Et j'arrive pas à me concentrer, sachant que tu es là.
S'il te plait, ça ira bien !
Ca ira bien.
Promets-moi que tu viendras à l'abri,
une fois que ce sera réparé !
Promets-le moi !
Je te le promets, maman.
Je veux mon fils avec moi.
D'accord, vas-y.
S'il te plait.
Frank !, Arrête de jouer avec la télé !
Je ne veux pas griller l'écran à cause de l'électricité statique.
Mary.
- Que font ces gens encore ici ?
- Ils ne partiront pas !
Et je ne peux pas laisser ces clowns dans mon bar.
D'accord, écoutez bien !
Les radiations sont en chemin depuis Denver.
Si vous n'avez pas de sous-sol,
Vous devez rejoindre la Mairie.
Il y a un abri là-bas !
Je ne vais pas à la Mairie.
Bien, vous n'avez pas le choix, messieurs.
Vous êtes évacués.
Et qui es-tu ?
Je suis l'adjoint au Maire.
Quoi, ton papa a fait de toi un adjoint ?
Oublie ça, Eric.
Tu as prévenu tout le monde.
Vous réalisez qu'une bombe nucléaire a explosé hier ?
Donc... ?
Si je dois mourir dans un souffle nucléaire, que ce soit ainsi.
Je serai juste ici,
jouant au billard avec mes potes.
Mais tu ne vas pas mourir dans ce souffle.
Tu vas être empoisonné par les radiations.
Durant les deux premières heures..
Tu vas vomir, et avoir une diarrhée d'enfer.
Tes cheveux vont tomber par grosses touffes.
Ta peau...
Va se boursoufler.
Tes organes internes vont commencer à s'arrêter.
Parce que, et bien, franchement...
Ils seront cuits de l'intérieur.
Tu vas tomber de plus en plus malade...
Jusqu'à ce que tu ne puisses plus bouger.
Et alors tu mourras...
Là-bas sur le plancher à côté de la table de billard...
Avec tes potes !
Oups.
Faites pas attention.
Restez là...
Nous revenons de suite.
<i>Shérif, à vous..</i>
<i>A vous, shérif, terminé</i>
<i>Randall, personne n'a eu de nouvelles du shérif depuis la nuit dernière.</i>
<i>Il y avait un bus carcéral là dehors.</i>
<i>Je pense que nous ferions mieux de nous préparer au pire.</i>
<i>Vous êtes seul.</i>
<i>Qu'en est-il de Jimmy ou Bill ?</i>
<i>Les adjoints sont manquant, aussi...
<i>Vous allez devoir gérer ça vous-même.</i>
Vous ne pensiez pas qu'on vous avait oublié ?
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Non, rien !
- Je crois pas qu'il y ai encore quelqu'un ici.
- Ouais, et bien, la pompe est fermée, alors...
Vous savez, il y a d'autre endroit ou aller.
Ecoutez, on ne peut plus se le permettre....
Un seul bruit, et vous êtes morts.
Je suis désolée, monsieur, je pense pas qu'il y ai quelqu'un...
Melle Sullivan...
- Quelle surprise !
- Salut, Bonnie !
Bouteilles d'oxygène, intraveineuses...
Toutes les fournitures médicales non électriques.
- Ca a été écrit quand ?
- En 1957
La population de Jéricho était de mille personnes.
On se met tous en action.
Je vais réparer le système de ventilation.
Bon sang, ils ont tout bousillé.
Ca te dérange si je m'y attaque.
Vous savez dénuder des fils ?
Depuis le collège...
Ouais, j'étais ce genre de fille...
D'accord, génial !
Vérifie la courroie du ventilateur, Je pense qu'elle s'est effilochée.
Bien, alors vous pourriez en avoir besoin d'une autre.
N'importe quelle voiture américaine de
la moitié du siècle pourrait correspondre.
Et vérifié les brosses, nous ne voulons pas que le moteur les arrache...
Ok, d'accord !
Tu prends la relève.
Je chercherai une courroie de ventilateur.
Excusez-moi ?
Monsieur ?
Vous ne faites pas cela comme il faut !
April !
Elle pense qu'on ne devrait pas déplacer le bébé...
M'dame.
Votre bébé est bien protégé dans sa petite bulle.
Elle a de l'air propre et de la nourriture.
A cet instant, c'est la personne la plus
en sécurité de Jéricho. Mais pas vous...
On doit s'assurer qu'elle aura une mère pour
s'occuper d'elle quand tout ça sera terminé.
D'accord ?
S'il vous plait !
S'il vous plait, vous devez descendre
toutes les deux dans l'abri ?
D'accord ?
Hum hum.
Bien...
- Bobby !
- Jake Green ?
Deux secondes, m'dame !
- Bobby, il y en a deux dans la nurse...
- Je suis la tante d'Emily Sullivan !
Mme Dawson, bonjour !
- Avez-vous vue Emily ?
- Non, pas depuis hier.
Peut-être qu'elle se trouve dans l'autre abri...
Personne là-bas ne l'a vue...
Et elle n'est pas chez elle.
J'ai entendu que vous étiez de retour en ville.
Et j'ai pensée que la personne qui saurait...
Je suis désolé...Je dois y aller.
Si je la vois, je lui dirais que vous la cherchait.
Mais je suis sûr qu'elle va bien.
Donc, on va juste, hum...
Utiliser votre pompe et continuer notre route...
C'est Stanley qui a la clé !
Que vient-elle de dire ?
Ho... son frère, Stanley
Il a la clé de la pompe.
Attendez !
Elle est sourde ?
Oui !
Je lis sur les lèvres.
Quand pense-tu que Stanley va revenir ?
Dans une heure, il...
- Wo wo wo....
- Que vient-elle te dire ?
Qu'il fallait compter une heure.
Ho...
On peut attendre une heure, n'est ce pas ?
Melle Sullivan...
Tout va bien ?
Oui, bien
J'ai juste faim...
Yeah, hum...
Pourquoi ne faisons-nous pas à manger pour les officiers ?
Oh, je veux des oeufs !
C'est une ferme, vous avez des oeufs, pas vrai ?
Ouais, pourquoi nous ne, hum...
Pourquoi n'allons-nous pas tous préparer à manger ?
Bien sûr !
<i>Les habitants du sud de la ville viennent à la Mairie ?</i>
Ouais, c'est ça !
Tout ceux au nord de la rue
principale vont au centre médical.
Johnston !
Bien, ok, je sais, tu veux que je me calme..
Je vais juste aller aider Eric à
récupérer la nourriture chez Gracie...
J'ai déjà envoyé des personnes pour faire cela !
Gail, qui est responsable ici, toi ou moi ?
Tu ne veux quand même pas jouer à ça !
Voici tous les livres que nous avons à la
bibliothèque traitants des radiations nucléaires.
"Notre Ami l'Atome" ?
Drôle d'ami...
Y a t il quelque chose pour des adultes ?
Je voudrais savoir ce que nous sommes censés faire,
si cette ville y a droit.
Aucun des livres n'est spécialisé...
Il n'existe que deux cas dans l'histoire,
ou des bombes atomiques ont ravagé des villes.
Et Denver a été probablement frappé par
une bombe à l'hydrogène, de toute façon.
Quelle est la différence ?
Les bombes à l'hydrogène...
Elles éclatent littéralement l'air.
Donc, ce que vous nous
dites, c'est que personne ne sait...
..Ce qui arrive vraiment ?
Alors nous sélectionnons le pire scénario.
Que doit on faire ?
Une seconde monsieur, j'ai lu ça...
Laissez-moi juste...
Tout ce qui sera laissé dehors devra être nettoyé.
Et s'il pleut, les cinquante premiers centimètres du sol,
Devront être enlevés avant de pouvoir replanter.
Et dites à tout le monde de couvrir tous les puits d'eau.
C'est bien de ça qu'ils parlent, exact ?
Oui, oui, c'est exact.
Bien, vous l'avez entendu.
Jeff, assure-toi que tous les propriétaires de ranch mettent le bétail à l'intérieur.
Je vais travailler sur la radio.
Ca pourrait être notre dernière chance de
contacter quelqu'un avant un bon moment.
Il y a un groupe d'habitants dans l'église,
ils sont restés là-bas toute la nuit,
Je vais m'assurer qu'ils viennent dans l'abri.
- Reviens vite !
- Oui m'dame
Je vous dis qu'elles doivent être remplacées.
- Ecoute, fillette, ne me dis pas...
- S'il vous plaît, ne discutez pas...
Les brosses sont mortes !
Ca tourne trop vite, c'est...
Coupe !
Jake, tout le monde est prêt.
- Que faisons-nous maintenant ?
- Ne les laisse pas entrer dedans !
La pluie sera bientôt là.
Les gens ont peur.
Nous avons la ventilation, ou pas ?
Si vous les enfermez ici, ils vont mourir...
Allo papa ?
Papa, tu m'entends ?
Papa est parti vérifier l'église, Jake.
De quoi as-tu besoin ?
Notre abri n'est pas opérationnel.
J'amène ces gens à la Mairie.
Whoa, whoa, attends !
Jake, je ne sais pas combien de
personnes en plus peuvent y tenir.
- Qu'en est-il des sous-sol ?
- Ils n'ont pas de sous-sols, Eric.
C'est pourquoi ils sont venus ici.
Eric, nous avons 200 personnes ici !
Certains d'entre eux ont besoin d'une assistance médicale.
Gère ça.
Ecoute, je serais bientôt à la Mairie.
Je vois combien d'espaces ils nous reste,
et je te rappelle.
On n'a pas de temps, on arrive.
Désolée, mon mari a besoin d'un bon coup de pied parfois.
Tu n'as pas à me faire d'excuses.
J'ai dois aller à l'abri.
Apportez toute la nourriture que vous pouvez.
Combien vous en faut-il encore ?
Assez pour nourrir la moitié de la ville, Gracie !
La moitié de la ville ?
Attendez !
- Skylar, tu dois venir à l'abri...
- Je ne vais aller dans cet abri stupide !
Je vais chez moi attendre mes parents.
- Ne sois pas folle...
- Je ne suis pas folle !
- Je rentre chez moi !
- Bien...
Excusez-moi, jeunes filles ?
Allez-vous payer ça ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Tout le monde est entrain de se servir.
C'est toujours mon magasin !
Est-ce que c'est pour une urgence ?
D'accord, vous savez quoi ?
Bien, gardez-les !
Ses parents sont à New York, ok ?
Qui sait s'ils vont rentrer un jour...
- C'était juste deux cannetes de soda.
- Ce sont mes sodas.
Je dis, allons vers l'est.
Elle se dirigeait vers l'est, non ?
Hé ?
A quelle distance d'ici diriez-vous
que ces corbeaux étaient ?
A environ trois kilomètres
à l'ouest d'où vous m'avez pris.
Bon sang, alors nous irons au nord.
Hé !
Vous pouvez m'aider pour le café ?
Ouais, je vais vous montrer où il est...
Vous feriez mieux de descendre dans cet abri.
Le vent se déplace plus rapidement que nous le pensions.
Je surveille.
Emmenez tout le monde sous terre.
Vous savez, si vous arrivez à faire fonctionner ce truc,
Faites-moi juste une faveur, et découvrez qui nous a fait ça ?
<i>- Eric, à toi.
<i>- C'est Eric, j'écoute.</i>
<i>Deux bus arrivent à la Mairie.</i>
Wo, wo, wo !
S'il vous plaît, ne descendez pas du bus !
on n'a plus de place.
Eric, qu'es-tu entrain de faire, bordel ?
Ils ne peuvent pas entrer ici, Jake !
- Que veux-tu dire par ....
- Nous sommes plein !!
J'ai un bus plein de gens ici qui ont besoin d'un abri !
Tu vas vraiment renvoyer toutes ces personnes, Eric ?
Tu vas renvoyer ta femme ?
Nous ne laissons pas tout le monde rentrer...
Nous allons tous suffoquer !
Eric, il y a des personnes vraiment malades ici.
Et la tempête arrive !
D'accord, nous pouvons en prendre dix...
Et j'ai gardé une place pour toi.
Très bien, les dix plus critiques, rapidement !
Gray, la mine de sel, combien de personnes contiendrait-elle ?
Autant que tu le veux, mais je ne pense pas que...
Elle a un système de ventilation, exact ?
Ouais, et l'eau...
Très bien, c'est la meilleure option
que nous ayons maintenant, d'accord ?
Maman ?
As-tu vu ton père ?
Il m'a dit qu'il allait à l'église...
Bien, Gail, les gens de cette église sont revenus il y a vingt minutes...
Eric ?
Maman, nous allons trouver papa !
Jake, amène tes passagers à la mine.
- Laisse-nous en dix...
- J'irai avec vous, Jake !
Après 27 ans, personne ne
connaît mieux la mine que moi.
Je suppose que tu peux en prendre onze maintenant ?
Ca sera douze !
C'est mon environnement...
Je dois y être...
Ouais, c'est parti !
Hé !
Tout ira bien.
Accrochez-vous !
Ca sent bon.
Oh, non, non, je m'en occupe.
Aie !
- Je suis vraiment navré...
- Mince !
Oh, ça semble mauvais, allez de suite dans la cuisine,
et faites couler de l'eau froide dessus, ça s'arrêtera avant de cloquer.
Je nettoierai ce désordre...
- Que s'est-il passé ?
- Elle...
Je me suis brûlé la main...
Tu l'as laissé seule ?
Elle est réglo.
Il va bien.
Il survivra.
Je peux seulement descendre douze
personnes à la fois avec l'ascenseur !
C'est le mieux que je puisse faire.
Shep, nous devons cloisonner l'entrée.
Il n'y a pas de porte, Jake.
La pluie ne doit pas aller dans le conduit,
Ces gens ne seraient pas en sécurité !
Nous ne serions pas en sécurité !
Et bien, comment le cloisonne-t-on ?
Je ne sais pas, mais c'est une mine !
Vous avez de la dynamite, pas vrai ?
Wo ?..Wo, wo... non !
Nous mettrons des charges là... là, là...
T'es malade ? qu'elle garantie on a,
que tous ne vas pas s'effondrer sur nous ?
Aucune...
Je vais dans la chambre de la petite fille.
Hé, et c'est où ?
Juste en haut !
- Juste là, tu vois?
- Bon à savoir...
Reculez !
- Eric, des nouvelles de papa ?
- Non, pas encore.
Nous avons vérifié l'église, la rue principale,
On vérifie chaque endroit de la ville en ce moment.
Ecoute, Eric...
Je vais avoir besoin d'une équipe par ici,
Pour déblayer, quand ce sera terminé.
Quoi ? Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
- On est prêt, Jake !
- Vous êtes dingues ?
Envoie une équipe ! Et trouve papa, okay ?
Allons-y !
Mr. Hawkins, mon père est passé par ici ?
Non, je ne l'ai pas vue.
Maman.
Vérifie le bureau encore une fois,
peut être qu'on a manqué quelque chose.
Je vais sortir vérifier le parking...
Ecoute, on va le retrouver, d'accord ?
D'accord !  Sois prudent, sois prudent !
Auriez-vous besoin d'aide m'dame ?
Non, on a besoin de vous à la radio.
Vous savez, je ne peux pas faire marcher cette vielle chose...
- D'accord, venez !
- Bien
S'il vous plait
Tu n'es pas chez moi.
Sors de ma propriété, immédiatement !
Et ma propriété s'étend d'ici jusqu'aux collines...
Tu dois retourner en ville !
Des radiations arrivent de Denver...
Je ne pars pas d'ici !
Mes parents sont sur le chemin du retour !
Tu leur a parlé ?
Non, taré, les téléphones sont mort.
Mais, je ne pars pas d'ici sans eux.
Très bien...
Reste à l'intérieur, scotch les fenêtres,
Et n'utilise pas l'eau.
Ne me dit pas ce que j'ai à faire.
Je suis sérieux, Skylar, reste à l'intérieur !
Dale ?
Dale, attend !
S'il te plait !
Reste ici.
C'est dangereux dehors.
S'il te plait, reste ici.
Jody, où es-tu ?
D'accord, tout le monde...
Hé, ho, ho, ho !
Retire ça de là, d'accord ?
Faut sceller l'entrée et non pas provoquer un effondrement.
Salut !
Où as-tu appris à faire ça ?
Un type que j'ai connu...
Tu l'as fais sauter ?
Allo ? Il y a quelqu'un ?
- Alors ça ressemble à quoi ?
- C'est bon, ça le fait.
- On en est où Gray?
- C'est le dernier.
- J'ai presque fini ici.
- Pareil ici.
Ici, Emily Sullivan, nous sommes au
Ranch Richmond avec Bonnie.
S'il vous plait, aidez-nous !
Vous m'entendez ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un ?
C'était quoi ça ?
Vous avez entendu ça ?
- C'est quelqu'un sur la radio !
- C'est Emily Sullivan
- Je suis au Ranch Richmond...
- Que tout le monde se taise !
Il y a des hommes ici avec des armes,
Je crois qu'ils ont tué le shérif...  Allo ?
Vous m'entendez ?
Emily !
Emily !
Emily, tu m'entends ?
Emily !
Répondez, répondez !
Allez, vous m'entendez ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un en ligne ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un sur cette fréquence ?
Est-ce que quelqu'un m'entend ?
Shep, donne-moi tes clés !
Jake, il va commencer à
pleuvoir d'une minute à l'autre !
Donne-moi tes clés, j'ai encore le temps !
- D'accord
- Jake, t'es cinglé
Gray... rentre tout le monde
à l'intérieur, d'accord ?
- Hé, Jake !
- Quoi ?
Quand tout le monde sera dedans..
Dis : "la voie est libre"
"La voie est libre", ok ?
<i>Presque paré, Jake, tiens toi prêt...</i>
Aller, aller !
<i>Jake ?</i>
<i>"La voie est libre " !</i>
Johnston?  Johnston?
Gail...
Oh, mon Dieu
M. Hawkins !
M. Hawkins !
M. Hawkins !!
Où est le frère ?
Où diable est la fille ?
Je crois qu'ils l'ont tué...
Je crois qu'ils ont tué le shérif.
S'il vous plait, aidez-nous !
Allo ? Je suis Emily Sullivan...
Je cherche à joindre le Département de Police de Jéricho
Est-ce que vous m'entendez ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un en ligne ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un sur cette fréquence ?
<i>Il y a des hommes ici avec des armes,
Je crois qu'ils ont tué le shérif !</i>
S'il vous plait, aidez-nous.
Cours, Emily !
Cours !
Hé !  Hé !
Stop !
Stop !
- Réfléchis-y à deux fois !
- Laissez-la partir !
Non...
On veut juste de l'essence.
Du ravitaillement, il ne s'agit que de ça.
Il n'est question que de carburant...
Laissez-la partir !
Regarde !
S'il vous plait,
s'il vous plait, lâchez-la !
Non...
C'est vraiment ce que tu veux voir ?
Alors vous êtes prête à discuter mam'zelle ?
S'il vous plait, laissez la partir !
April...
April, viens là !
Hé papa, tu peux me dire ce qu'il s'est passé ?
Assis-toi. Voilà, assis-toi là...
Je l'ai trouvé par terre dans son bureau.
Tu t'ai cogné la tête ?
Très bien !
Bonnie, emmène-les à l'abri dans le bunker maintenant !
Allez les gars, allez-y !
Emily, on doit aller à l'intérieur !
Emily ?  Emily, hé ?
Tout va bien se passer !
D'accord ? Je te le promets !
Tout va bien se passer, d'accord ?
On doit y aller maintenant, bébé !
Bébé !
On doit aller à l'intérieur avant qu'il pleuve, okay ?
Viens avec moi !
Viens là !
Cours !
Cours !
Va à l'intérieur !
- Salut papa !
- Salut !
Comment tu vas ?
T'es bien installé ?
C'est comme le camping.
Tu détestes le camping !
Ouais !
Où est Allison ?
- Elle est en haut dans sa chambre...
- Samuel, va chercher Ali.
Ouais m'sieur !
- Dis lui que je suis là.
- Oui m'sieur !
Robert ?  Robert ?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe là-dehors ?
- Je ne sais pas !
Si tu sais...
- Tu sais toujours tout...
- Hé, hé !
Tu es en vie, Darcy.
D'accord ?
Et les enfants sont en sécurité.
Alors tu sais, ne me pose pas de questions...
Je crois que ma mère est morte hier...
Je crois que ma mère est morte hier, aussi...
Je croyais que t'étais parti ?
- Emily...
- Pourquoi t'es là ?
J'essaye de te protéger.
C'est pas évident à tes côtés...

Précédemment dans Jéricho...
Jake Green !
Comment vas-tu mec ?
Attends un peu...
- Mais où étais-tu passé ?
- Dans les parages...
Jake, personne ne reste
"dans les parages" pendant 5 ans !
Sérieusement,
où étais-tu passé ?
Hé, mon frère !
Par ce que tu as
mis cette famille...
- Johnston, pour l'amour de Dieu !
- Maintenant, il pourrait avoir été...
Nous pourrions passer une semaine à
parler de ce que j'aurais pu être, d'accord ?
Je me suis excusé, mais j'ai besoin
de mon argent pour tout recommencer...
Ce n'est pas ton argent !
C'est l'argent de ton grand-père
Reste un jour de plus !
Je dois rentrer à San
Diego avant demain
Ok, il semblerait que l'explosion
vienne de l'ouest, peut-être Denver
Est-ce que quelque
chose est arrivé ?
Sommes-nous attaqués ?
Bonjour Dale.  Pardon de ne pas t'avoir
appelée plus tôt mon ange, mais nous...
Oh mon Dieu !
Oh mon Dieu !!
Shérif ?
Robert Hawkins
Je suis vraiment navrée !
Je ne savais pas que
ta mère était à Denver...
Elle n'était pas à Denver...
Elle était à Atlanta !
Oh mon Dieu !
Ecoutez, je sais que vous dites
aux gens que c'était un accident
Mais si c'était une
attaque, shérif !
Et c'est le
chaos là-dehors
Vous ne voulez peut-être
pas que les gens sachent
Que Jéricho
est toujours là !
C'est le mauvais bus !
Riley !!
Contacte April...
Il y a un bus carcéral
vide là-dehors
Comment vous
appelez-vous ?
Heather
Ravi de vous
connaître, Jack !
C'est super ce que
tu as fais là ce soir !
Merci !
Quelque chose s'est
produit à Denver, Atlanta...
Et il se pourrait que
nous nous réveillions
Et nous découvrions
où cela s'est arrêté
Mais, jusqu'à ce
que nous sachions...
Allons-nous utiliser nos imaginations
pour résoudre les problèmes
Ou pour les causer ?

JERICHO
Saison 1 - Episode 02
" Fallout "
Y a t il un signe quelconque
du shérif, M. Hawkins ?
Non, monsieur !
J'ai besoin de parler à votre Maire.
Nous avons des ennuis qui arrivent !
Oh, mon Dieu !
Maman, où se trouve April ?
- Jake, où étais-tu passé ?
- Où est-elle ?
Elle est au bout du couloir.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Contacte papa avec la radio
Vous serez plus mobile avec ça.
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
Je me sens comme une empotée !
April, la clinique a-t-elle un abri anti-atomique ?
Oui, que se passe-t-il ?
C'est mauvais, viens !
Jéricho possède deux abris anti-atomiques.
L'un juste ici, sous la Mairie,
L'autre, sous le centre médical.
Qu'en est il des sous-sols et des caves anti-tempête ?
Ils sont mieux que rien !
Mais vous devez isoler le reste de la maison.
Avec euh... du scotch, des bâches en plastique...
Tout ce sur quoi vous pourrez mettre la main !
Comment savez-vous tout ça sur les radiations, M. Hawkins ?
Parce que j'étais policier à Saint Louis.
Et depuis le 11 septembre, nous avons du monter en régime !
Notre plus grand problème pourrait être la pluie.
La pluie ne dégagera-t-elle pas les radiations de l'air ?
Oui, et l'apportera directement sur Jéricho.
Une salve directe et concentrée.
N'importe qui exposé trop longtemps...
M. le Maire ?
Monsieur ?
Ok, écoutez !  Nous allons
diviser la ville en deux secteurs.
Chacun ici peut aller à l'abri de la Mairie.
Tout ceux du côté du nord iront à la clinique.
Nous allons faire passer le message, papa !
Combien de temps avant que les radiations n'arrivent ici ?
Oh, je ne suis pas d'ici !
C'est votre ville !
Combien de temps met normalement
une tempête pour arriver depuis Denver ?
- Moins de deux heures...
- C'est juste !
Deux heures ?
Nous ne pouvons pas faire cela
en deux heures !  Pas assez de temps !
Nous avons du pain sur la planche les gars !
Jake et moi jouions ici quand nous étions gosses.
Je ne pense pas que, qui que
ce soit, soit descendu ici en dix ans.
Combien de personnes peuvent tenir ici ?
Trois cents.
Vous savez qu'il y a presque
cinq milles personnes dans cette ville.
- Eric ?
- Oui ?
Assure-toi que toutes les personnes qui ont
des sous-sols les utilisent !
Nous ne sortirons pas aujourd'hui, compris ?
Compris, papa !
Jimmy !
C'était quand la dernière fois...
Que quelqu'un est venu ici ?
C'est une plaisanterie !
Je ne peux pas mettre de gens là-dedans !
Il n'y a pas d'air...
Il n'y a pas d'air là-dedans !
J'espère que la ventilation fonctionne.
Nous avons beaucoup de boulot.
Attendez, attendez !!
Hé, hé !
Oh, merci mon Dieu !
Je n'ai vu personne depuis des heures !
Je suis tombé en panne d'essence !
Il y a des oiseaux morts tout au long de la route...
Ouais, nous les avons vus aussi,
Ils ont du volé à travers les radiations.
Quelles radiations ?
Il y avait un nuage en forme de champignon !
Quelqu'un nous a atomisé !
Oh, mon Dieu !
Ecoutez mademoiselle, nous sommes à court d'essence,
savez-vous s'il y a une station par ici ?
Vous pensez que c'est quoi .... ?
que c'est un accident ou... ?
M'dame, nous ne le savons pas encore !
Ok...
Cela venait-il de Wichita ?
- Parce que mon fiancé, il vole depuis...
- Non non, mauvaise direction, cela venait plus de Denver.
Oh mon Dieu...
Ecoutez, nous avons besoin d'essence.
Savez-vous s'il y a une station prêt d'ici  ?
Ouais, non !
Non, les pompes sont...
Elles ne fonctionnent pas !
Elles ont toutes été abandonnées...
Non, nous... nous pourrions essayer le Ranch Richmond.
Ils devraient avoir de l'essence là-bas !
Montez alors, nous vous y emmenons.
Mademoiselle !
C'est bon !
Montez !
Dale ?
Réveille-toi.
Réveille-toi, mon ange.
Maman ?
Tu ne te rappelle pas, ce qui s'est passé la nuit dernière ?
Ta mère est partie.
Gracie ?
Allez Gracie ! Ouvre !
Gracie, nous devons stocker de la nourriture dans les abris !
<i>Attention ! Attention  !</i>
<i>Il y a des retombées radioactives provenant du souffle nucléaire.</i>
<i>Vous avez moins de 90 minutes pour rentrer à l'intérieur !</i>
<i>Je répète, vous avez moins de
90 minutes pour rentrer à l'intérieur.</i>
<i>Utilisez vos sous-sols.</i>
<i>Utilisez du scotch ou toute adhésif
pour cloisonner votre maison.</i>
<i>Vous avez moins de 90 minutes !</i>
<i>Vous pouvez aller à l'abri de la Mairie.</i>
<i>Ou à l'abri du centre médical.</i>
<i>Il y a des retombées radioactives qui arrivent.</i>
<i>Vous avez 90 minutes pour vous mettre à l'abris.</i>
Nous sommes à l'intérieur !
Tu n'es pas du coin, n'est-ce pas ?
Je suis venu de Washington pour
diriger un petit audit sur une ferme.
Dieu me punit-il ?
Ecoutez, vous devriez vraiment
aller au sous-sol de la Mairie.
Tu le pense ?
Jake, je ne vais nulle part !
Maman... maman !
Maman, je ne veux pas discuter avec toi.
- Vas à l'autre abris
- Je reste !
Maman !  Je ne sais même pas si nous pouvons le réparer,
Et j'arrive pas à me concentrer, sachant que tu es là.
S'il te plait, ça ira bien !
Ca ira bien.
Promets-moi que tu viendras à l'abri,
une fois que ce sera réparé !
Promets-le moi !
Je te le promets, maman.
Je veux mon fils avec moi.
D'accord, vas-y.
S'il te plait.
Frank !, Arrête de jouer avec la télé !
Je ne veux pas griller l'écran à cause de l'électricité statique.
Mary.
- Que font ces gens encore ici ?
- Ils ne partiront pas !
Et je ne peux pas laisser ces clowns dans mon bar.
D'accord, écoutez bien !
Les radiations sont en chemin depuis Denver.
Si vous n'avez pas de sous-sol,
Vous devez rejoindre la Mairie.
Il y a un abri là-bas !
Je ne vais pas à la Mairie.
Bien, vous n'avez pas le choix, messieurs.
Vous êtes évacués.
Et qui es-tu ?
Je suis l'adjoint au Maire.
Quoi, ton papa a fait de toi un adjoint ?
Oublie ça, Eric.
Tu as prévenu tout le monde.
Vous réalisez qu'une bombe nucléaire a explosé hier ?
Donc... ?
Si je dois mourir dans un souffle nucléaire, que ce soit ainsi.
Je serai juste ici,
jouant au billard avec mes potes.
Mais tu ne vas pas mourir dans ce souffle.
Tu vas être empoisonné par les radiations.
Durant les deux premières heures..
Tu vas vomir, et avoir une diarrhée d'enfer.
Tes cheveux vont tomber par grosses touffes.
Ta peau...
Va se boursoufler.
Tes organes internes vont commencer à s'arrêter.
Parce que, et bien, franchement...
Ils seront cuits de l'intérieur.
Tu vas tomber de plus en plus malade...
Jusqu'à ce que tu ne puisses plus bouger.
Et alors tu mourras...
Là-bas sur le plancher à côté de la table de billard...
Avec tes potes !
Oups.
Faites pas attention.
Restez là...
Nous revenons de suite.
<i>Shérif, à vous..</i>
<i>A vous, shérif, terminé</i>
<i>Randall, personne n'a eu de nouvelles du shérif depuis la nuit dernière.</i>
<i>Il y avait un bus carcéral là dehors.</i>
<i>Je pense que nous ferions mieux de nous préparer au pire.</i>
<i>Vous êtes seul.</i>
<i>Qu'en est-il de Jimmy ou Bill ?</i>
<i>Les adjoints sont manquant, aussi...
<i>Vous allez devoir gérer ça vous-même.</i>
Vous ne pensiez pas qu'on vous avait oublié ?
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Non, rien !
- Je crois pas qu'il y ai encore quelqu'un ici.
- Ouais, et bien, la pompe est fermée, alors...
Vous savez, il y a d'autre endroit ou aller.
Ecoutez, on ne peut plus se le permettre....
Un seul bruit, et vous êtes morts.
Je suis désolée, monsieur, je pense pas qu'il y ai quelqu'un...
Melle Sullivan...
- Quelle surprise !
- Salut, Bonnie !
Bouteilles d'oxygène, intraveineuses...
Toutes les fournitures médicales non électriques.
- Ca a été écrit quand ?
- En 1957
La population de Jéricho était de mille personnes.
On se met tous en action.
Je vais réparer le système de ventilation.
Bon sang, ils ont tout bousillé.
Ca te dérange si je m'y attaque.
Vous savez dénuder des fils ?
Depuis le collège...
Ouais, j'étais ce genre de fille...
D'accord, génial !
Vérifie la courroie du ventilateur, Je pense qu'elle s'est effilochée.
Bien, alors vous pourriez en avoir besoin d'une autre.
N'importe quelle voiture américaine de
la moitié du siècle pourrait correspondre.
Et vérifié les brosses, nous ne voulons pas que le moteur les arrache...
Ok, d'accord !
Tu prends la relève.
Je chercherai une courroie de ventilateur.
Excusez-moi ?
Monsieur ?
Vous ne faites pas cela comme il faut !
April !
Elle pense qu'on ne devrait pas déplacer le bébé...
M'dame.
Votre bébé est bien protégé dans sa petite bulle.
Elle a de l'air propre et de la nourriture.
A cet instant, c'est la personne la plus
en sécurité de Jéricho. Mais pas vous...
On doit s'assurer qu'elle aura une mère pour
s'occuper d'elle quand tout ça sera terminé.
D'accord ?
S'il vous plait !
S'il vous plait, vous devez descendre
toutes les deux dans l'abri ?
D'accord ?
Hum hum.
Bien...
- Bobby !
- Jake Green ?
Deux secondes, m'dame !
- Bobby, il y en a deux dans la nurse...
- Je suis la tante d'Emily Sullivan !
Mme Dawson, bonjour !
- Avez-vous vue Emily ?
- Non, pas depuis hier.
Peut-être qu'elle se trouve dans l'autre abri...
Personne là-bas ne l'a vue...
Et elle n'est pas chez elle.
J'ai entendu que vous étiez de retour en ville.
Et j'ai pensée que la personne qui saurait...
Je suis désolé...Je dois y aller.
Si je la vois, je lui dirais que vous la cherchait.
Mais je suis sûr qu'elle va bien.
Donc, on va juste, hum...
Utiliser votre pompe et continuer notre route...
C'est Stanley qui a la clé !
Que vient-elle de dire ?
Ho... son frère, Stanley
Il a la clé de la pompe.
Attendez !
Elle est sourde ?
Oui !
Je lis sur les lèvres.
Quand pense-tu que Stanley va revenir ?
Dans une heure, il...
- Wo wo wo....
- Que vient-elle te dire ?
Qu'il fallait compter une heure.
Ho...
On peut attendre une heure, n'est ce pas ?
Melle Sullivan...
Tout va bien ?
Oui, bien
J'ai juste faim...
Yeah, hum...
Pourquoi ne faisons-nous pas à manger pour les officiers ?
Oh, je veux des oeufs !
C'est une ferme, vous avez des oeufs, pas vrai ?
Ouais, pourquoi nous ne, hum...
Pourquoi n'allons-nous pas tous préparer à manger ?
Bien sûr !
<i>Les habitants du sud de la ville viennent à la Mairie ?</i>
Ouais, c'est ça !
Tout ceux au nord de la rue
principale vont au centre médical.
Johnston !
Bien, ok, je sais, tu veux que je me calme..
Je vais juste aller aider Eric à
récupérer la nourriture chez Gracie...
J'ai déjà envoyé des personnes pour faire cela !
Gail, qui est responsable ici, toi ou moi ?
Tu ne veux quand même pas jouer à ça !
Voici tous les livres que nous avons à la
bibliothèque traitants des radiations nucléaires.
"Notre Ami l'Atome" ?
Drôle d'ami...
Y a t il quelque chose pour des adultes ?
Je voudrais savoir ce que nous sommes censés faire,
si cette ville y a droit.
Aucun des livres n'est spécialisé...
Il n'existe que deux cas dans l'histoire,
ou des bombes atomiques ont ravagé des villes.
Et Denver a été probablement frappé par
une bombe à l'hydrogène, de toute façon.
Quelle est la différence ?
Les bombes à l'hydrogène...
Elles éclatent littéralement l'air.
Donc, ce que vous nous
dites, c'est que personne ne sait...
..Ce qui arrive vraiment ?
Alors nous sélectionnons le pire scénario.
Que doit on faire ?
Une seconde monsieur, j'ai lu ça...
Laissez-moi juste...
Tout ce qui sera laissé dehors devra être nettoyé.
Et s'il pleut, les cinquante premiers centimètres du sol,
Devront être enlevés avant de pouvoir replanter.
Et dites à tout le monde de couvrir tous les puits d'eau.
C'est bien de ça qu'ils parlent, exact ?
Oui, oui, c'est exact.
Bien, vous l'avez entendu.
Jeff, assure-toi que tous les propriétaires de ranch mettent le bétail à l'intérieur.
Je vais travailler sur la radio.
Ca pourrait être notre dernière chance de
contacter quelqu'un avant un bon moment.
Il y a un groupe d'habitants dans l'église,
ils sont restés là-bas toute la nuit,
Je vais m'assurer qu'ils viennent dans l'abri.
- Reviens vite !
- Oui m'dame
Je vous dis qu'elles doivent être remplacées.
- Ecoute, fillette, ne me dis pas...
- S'il vous plaît, ne discutez pas...
Les brosses sont mortes !
Ca tourne trop vite, c'est...
Coupe !
Jake, tout le monde est prêt.
- Que faisons-nous maintenant ?
- Ne les laisse pas entrer dedans !
La pluie sera bientôt là.
Les gens ont peur.
Nous avons la ventilation, ou pas ?
Si vous les enfermez ici, ils vont mourir...
Allo papa ?
Papa, tu m'entends ?
Papa est parti vérifier l'église, Jake.
De quoi as-tu besoin ?
Notre abri n'est pas opérationnel.
J'amène ces gens à la Mairie.
Whoa, whoa, attends !
Jake, je ne sais pas combien de
personnes en plus peuvent y tenir.
- Qu'en est-il des sous-sol ?
- Ils n'ont pas de sous-sols, Eric.
C'est pourquoi ils sont venus ici.
Eric, nous avons 200 personnes ici !
Certains d'entre eux ont besoin d'une assistance médicale.
Gère ça.
Ecoute, je serais bientôt à la Mairie.
Je vois combien d'espaces ils nous reste,
et je te rappelle.
On n'a pas de temps, on arrive.
Désolée, mon mari a besoin d'un bon coup de pied parfois.
Tu n'as pas à me faire d'excuses.
J'ai dois aller à l'abri.
Apportez toute la nourriture que vous pouvez.
Combien vous en faut-il encore ?
Assez pour nourrir la moitié de la ville, Gracie !
La moitié de la ville ?
Attendez !
- Skylar, tu dois venir à l'abri...
- Je ne vais aller dans cet abri stupide !
Je vais chez moi attendre mes parents.
- Ne sois pas folle...
- Je ne suis pas folle !
- Je rentre chez moi !
- Bien...
Excusez-moi, jeunes filles ?
Allez-vous payer ça ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Tout le monde est entrain de se servir.
C'est toujours mon magasin !
Est-ce que c'est pour une urgence ?
D'accord, vous savez quoi ?
Bien, gardez-les !
Ses parents sont à New York, ok ?
Qui sait s'ils vont rentrer un jour...
- C'était juste deux cannetes de soda.
- Ce sont mes sodas.
Je dis, allons vers l'est.
Elle se dirigeait vers l'est, non ?
Hé ?
A quelle distance d'ici diriez-vous
que ces corbeaux étaient ?
A environ trois kilomètres
à l'ouest d'où vous m'avez pris.
Bon sang, alors nous irons au nord.
Hé !
Vous pouvez m'aider pour le café ?
Ouais, je vais vous montrer où il est...
Vous feriez mieux de descendre dans cet abri.
Le vent se déplace plus rapidement que nous le pensions.
Je surveille.
Emmenez tout le monde sous terre.
Vous savez, si vous arrivez à faire fonctionner ce truc,
Faites-moi juste une faveur, et découvrez qui nous a fait ça ?
<i>- Eric, à toi.
<i>- C'est Eric, j'écoute.</i>
<i>Deux bus arrivent à la Mairie.</i>
Wo, wo, wo !
S'il vous plaît, ne descendez pas du bus !
on n'a plus de place.
Eric, qu'es-tu entrain de faire, bordel ?
Ils ne peuvent pas entrer ici, Jake !
- Que veux-tu dire par ....
- Nous sommes plein !!
J'ai un bus plein de gens ici qui ont besoin d'un abri !
Tu vas vraiment renvoyer toutes ces personnes, Eric ?
Tu vas renvoyer ta femme ?
Nous ne laissons pas tout le monde rentrer...
Nous allons tous suffoquer !
Eric, il y a des personnes vraiment malades ici.
Et la tempête arrive !
D'accord, nous pouvons en prendre dix...
Et j'ai gardé une place pour toi.
Très bien, les dix plus critiques, rapidement !
Gray, la mine de sel, combien de personnes contiendrait-elle ?
Autant que tu le veux, mais je ne pense pas que...
Elle a un système de ventilation, exact ?
Ouais, et l'eau...
Très bien, c'est la meilleure option
que nous ayons maintenant, d'accord ?
Maman ?
As-tu vu ton père ?
Il m'a dit qu'il allait à l'église...
Bien, Gail, les gens de cette église sont revenus il y a vingt minutes...
Eric ?
Maman, nous allons trouver papa !
Jake, amène tes passagers à la mine.
- Laisse-nous en dix...
- J'irai avec vous, Jake !
Après 27 ans, personne ne
connaît mieux la mine que moi.
Je suppose que tu peux en prendre onze maintenant ?
Ca sera douze !
C'est mon environnement...
Je dois y être...
Ouais, c'est parti !
Hé !
Tout ira bien.
Accrochez-vous !
Ca sent bon.
Oh, non, non, je m'en occupe.
Aie !
- Je suis vraiment navré...
- Mince !
Oh, ça semble mauvais, allez de suite dans la cuisine,
et faites couler de l'eau froide dessus, ça s'arrêtera avant de cloquer.
Je nettoierai ce désordre...
- Que s'est-il passé ?
- Elle...
Je me suis brûlé la main...
Tu l'as laissé seule ?
Elle est réglo.
Il va bien.
Il survivra.
Je peux seulement descendre douze
personnes à la fois avec l'ascenseur !
C'est le mieux que je puisse faire.
Shep, nous devons cloisonner l'entrée.
Il n'y a pas de porte, Jake.
La pluie ne doit pas aller dans le conduit,
Ces gens ne seraient pas en sécurité !
Nous ne serions pas en sécurité !
Et bien, comment le cloisonne-t-on ?
Je ne sais pas, mais c'est une mine !
Vous avez de la dynamite, pas vrai ?
Wo ?..Wo, wo... non !
Nous mettrons des charges là... là, là...
T'es malade ? qu'elle garantie on a,
que tous ne vas pas s'effondrer sur nous ?
Aucune...
Je vais dans la chambre de la petite fille.
Hé, et c'est où ?
Juste en haut !
- Juste là, tu vois?
- Bon à savoir...
Reculez !
- Eric, des nouvelles de papa ?
- Non, pas encore.
Nous avons vérifié l'église, la rue principale,
On vérifie chaque endroit de la ville en ce moment.
Ecoute, Eric...
Je vais avoir besoin d'une équipe par ici,
Pour déblayer, quand ce sera terminé.
Quoi ? Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
- On est prêt, Jake !
- Vous êtes dingues ?
Envoie une équipe ! Et trouve papa, okay ?
Allons-y !
Mr. Hawkins, mon père est passé par ici ?
Non, je ne l'ai pas vue.
Maman.
Vérifie le bureau encore une fois,
peut être qu'on a manqué quelque chose.
Je vais sortir vérifier le parking...
Ecoute, on va le retrouver, d'accord ?
D'accord !  Sois prudent, sois prudent !
Auriez-vous besoin d'aide m'dame ?
Non, on a besoin de vous à la radio.
Vous savez, je ne peux pas faire marcher cette vielle chose...
- D'accord, venez !
- Bien
S'il vous plait
Tu n'es pas chez moi.
Sors de ma propriété, immédiatement !
Et ma propriété s'étend d'ici jusqu'aux collines...
Tu dois retourner en ville !
Des radiations arrivent de Denver...
Je ne pars pas d'ici !
Mes parents sont sur le chemin du retour !
Tu leur a parlé ?
Non, taré, les téléphones sont mort.
Mais, je ne pars pas d'ici sans eux.
Très bien...
Reste à l'intérieur, scotch les fenêtres,
Et n'utilise pas l'eau.
Ne me dit pas ce que j'ai à faire.
Je suis sérieux, Skylar, reste à l'intérieur !
Dale ?
Dale, attend !
S'il te plait !
Reste ici.
C'est dangereux dehors.
S'il te plait, reste ici.
Jody, où es-tu ?
D'accord, tout le monde...
Hé, ho, ho, ho !
Retire ça de là, d'accord ?
Faut sceller l'entrée et non pas provoquer un effondrement.
Salut !
Où as-tu appris à faire ça ?
Un type que j'ai connu...
Tu l'as fais sauter ?
Allo ? Il y a quelqu'un ?
- Alors ça ressemble à quoi ?
- C'est bon, ça le fait.
- On en est où Gray?
- C'est le dernier.
- J'ai presque fini ici.
- Pareil ici.
Ici, Emily Sullivan, nous sommes au
Ranch Richmond avec Bonnie.
S'il vous plait, aidez-nous !
Vous m'entendez ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un ?
C'était quoi ça ?
Vous avez entendu ça ?
- C'est quelqu'un sur la radio !
- C'est Emily Sullivan
- Je suis au Ranch Richmond...
- Que tout le monde se taise !
Il y a des hommes ici avec des armes,
Je crois qu'ils ont tué le shérif...  Allo ?
Vous m'entendez ?
Emily !
Emily !
Emily, tu m'entends ?
Emily !
Répondez, répondez !
Allez, vous m'entendez ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un en ligne ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un sur cette fréquence ?
Est-ce que quelqu'un m'entend ?
Shep, donne-moi tes clés !
Jake, il va commencer à
pleuvoir d'une minute à l'autre !
Donne-moi tes clés, j'ai encore le temps !
- D'accord
- Jake, t'es cinglé
Gray... rentre tout le monde
à l'intérieur, d'accord ?
- Hé, Jake !
- Quoi ?
Quand tout le monde sera dedans..
Dis : "la voie est libre"
"La voie est libre", ok ?
<i>Presque paré, Jake, tiens toi prêt...</i>
Aller, aller !
<i>Jake ?</i>
<i>"La voie est libre " !</i>
Johnston?  Johnston?
Gail...
Oh, mon Dieu
M. Hawkins !
M. Hawkins !
M. Hawkins !!
Où est le frère ?
Où diable est la fille ?
Je crois qu'ils l'ont tué...
Je crois qu'ils ont tué le shérif.
S'il vous plait, aidez-nous !
Allo ? Je suis Emily Sullivan...
Je cherche à joindre le Département de Police de Jéricho
Est-ce que vous m'entendez ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un en ligne ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un sur cette fréquence ?
<i>Il y a des hommes ici avec des armes,
Je crois qu'ils ont tué le shérif !</i>
S'il vous plait, aidez-nous.
Cours, Emily !
Cours !
Hé !  Hé !
Stop !
Stop !
- Réfléchis-y à deux fois !
- Laissez-la partir !
Non...
On veut juste de l'essence.
Du ravitaillement, il ne s'agit que de ça.
Il n'est question que de carburant...
Laissez-la partir !
Regarde !
S'il vous plait,
s'il vous plait, lâchez-la !
Non...
C'est vraiment ce que tu veux voir ?
Alors vous êtes prête à discuter mam'zelle ?
S'il vous plait, laissez la partir !
April...
April, viens là !
Hé papa, tu peux me dire ce qu'il s'est passé ?
Assis-toi. Voilà, assis-toi là...
Je l'ai trouvé par terre dans son bureau.
Tu t'ai cogné la tête ?
Très bien !
Bonnie, emmène-les à l'abri dans le bunker maintenant !
Allez les gars, allez-y !
Emily, on doit aller à l'intérieur !
Emily ?  Emily, hé ?
Tout va bien se passer !
D'accord ? Je te le promets !
Tout va bien se passer, d'accord ?
On doit y aller maintenant, bébé !
Bébé !
On doit aller à l'intérieur avant qu'il pleuve, okay ?
Viens avec moi !
Viens là !
Cours !
Cours !
Va à l'intérieur !
- Salut papa !
- Salut !
Comment tu vas ?
T'es bien installé ?
C'est comme le camping.
Tu détestes le camping !
Ouais !
Où est Allison ?
- Elle est en haut dans sa chambre...
- Samuel, va chercher Ali.
Ouais m'sieur !
- Dis lui que je suis là.
- Oui m'sieur !
Robert ?  Robert ?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe là-dehors ?
- Je ne sais pas !
Si tu sais...
- Tu sais toujours tout...
- Hé, hé !
Tu es en vie, Darcy.
D'accord ?
Et les enfants sont en sécurité.
Alors tu sais, ne me pose pas de questions...
Je crois que ma mère est morte hier...
Je crois que ma mère est morte hier, aussi...
Je croyais que t'étais parti ?
- Emily...
- Pourquoi t'es là ?
J'essaye de te protéger.
C'est pas évident à tes côtés...

Previously on Jericho...
Jake Green!
How you doing, man?
Wait a minute.
--Where the hell you been?
--Around.
Jake, no one's been around for five years.
Seriously, where have you been?
Hey, brother.
What you put this family through...
--Johnston, for God's sake.
--Now, he could have been...
We could spend a week talking
about what I could have been, all right?
--I've apologized, but I need my
money to make a clean start.
--It's not your money.
It's your grandfather's money.
--Stay one more day.
--I've got to get back to San Diego by tomorrow.
All right, it looks like the explosion came
from the west, maybe Denver.
Did something happen?
Are we under attack?
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call
sooner, angel, but we...
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Sheriff? Robert Hawkins.
I am so sorry.
--I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
--She wasn't in Denver.
She was in Atlanta.
Oh, my God!
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident
but if it was an attack, Sheriff
and there's chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people knowing
that Jericho is still here.
It's the wrong bus!
Riley!
Get April.
We'll meet you at the medical center.
There's an empty prison bus out there.
--What's your name?
--Heather.
Nice to meet you, Jake.
--It's a great thing you did t there tonight.
--Thanks.
Something happened in Denver, Atlanta,
and it could be that we wake up
and we find out that's where it stopped.
But, until we know,
are we going to use our imaginations
to solve problems
or to cause them?
--Is there any sign of the sheriff, Mr. Hawkins?
--No, sir.
I need to speak to your mayor.
We got trouble coming.
Oh, my God.
Mom, where's April?
--Jake, where have you been?
--Where is she?
She's down the hall.
--What's going on?
--Get Dad on the radio.
You'll be fairly mobile on it.
How do you feel?
I feel like a badass.
--April, does the clinic have a fallout shelter?
--Yes. What's going on?
It's bad. Come on.
Jericho has two underground shelters,
one right here under the Town Hall
the other under the medical clinic
What about basements and storm cellars?
They're better than nothing
but you've got to seal off
the rest of the house
with, uh... duct tape, plastic sheeting,
anything you can get your hands on.
How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?
Because I was a cop in Saint Louis
and, after 9-11, we got up to speed.
So our biggest problem could be the rain.
Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?
Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho--
a direct, concentrated hit.
Anyone exposed too long...
Mr. Mayor? Sir?
All right, look.
We're gonna divide the town in two.
Everyone over here can go
to the Town Hall shelter
all those on the north side will
go to the clinic
We'll get the word out, Dad.
--How long before the radiation gets here?
--Oh, I'm new here.
This is your town.
How long does it normally take
a storm to get here from Denver?
--Less than two hours.
--Sounds right.
Two hours?
--We can't do that in two hours.
--Not enough time.
We've got work to do, guys.
Jake and I used to play down
here when we were kids.
I don't think anyone's
been down here in ten years.
--How many people can we fit in here?
--300.
You do know that there's almost
5,000 people in this town.
- -Eric?
--Yeah?
Make sure all the people
that have basements use them.
--We are not running out of room
here today. You understand?
--Got it, Dad.
Jimmy!
When was the last time someone was in here?
You're kidding me.
I can't put people in here.
There's no air.
There's no air in here.
I hope the fan works.
We got a lot of work to do.
Wait, wait! Hey, hey!
Oh, thank God. I haven't seen anybody for hours.
I ran out of gas.
--There's dead birds all over the road.
--Yeah, we saw them, too.
They must have flown through the radiation.
What radiation?
There was a mushroom cloud.
Somebody nuked us.
Oh, my God.
Look,  Miss, we're running low on gas.
Do you know if there's
a gas station nearby?
Well, what do you think it is?
--Do you think it's an accident or...?
--Ma'am, we don't know yet.
Okay.
Did it come from Wichita,
--because my fiance, he's flying in from...
--No, no. Wrong direction.
It looked more like Denver.
Look, we need gas.
--Do you know if there is a gas station nearby?
--Uh... yeah. No.
No, the pumps are...
They don't work.
They've all been abandoned.
No,  we could... We could try
the Richmond Ranch.
--I think they might have gas there.
--Then get in.
We'll take you there.
Miss?
It's okay. Get in.
Dale?
Wake up.
Wake up, angel.
Mom?
Don't you remember what happened last night?
Your mom's gone.
Gracie? Come on, Gracie!
Open up!
Gracie, we need to stock the shelters with food!
Attention! Attention!
There is radioactive fallout
coming from the nuclear blast.
You have less than 90 minutes to get indoors
I repeat, you have less than 90 minutes to get indoors.
Use your basements.
Use duct tape or other tape to seal your home.
You have less than 90 minutes.
You can go to the shelter at Town Hall
or the shelter at the medical center.
There is radioactive fallout coming.
You have 90 minutes to get yourselves indoors.
We are indoors!
You're not from around here, are you?
I came from D.C. to supervise
a little audit on a farm.
Is God punishing me?
Look, you really should get
to the basement at Town Hall.
You think?
--Jake, I'm not going anywhere.
--Mom...
Mom, I'm not going to argue with you.
--Go to the other shelter.
--I'm staying.
Mom, I don't even know if we can fix it
and I can't concentrate knowing you're here.
Please, I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
Promise me you'll come to the shelter
after it's fixed.
Promise me.
I promise, Mom.
I want my boys with me.
Okay, go.
Please.
Frank! Quit messing with the TV.
I don't want to waste my generator on static.
--Mary, what are these people still doing here?
--They won't go.
I can't leave these clowns in my bar.
All right, listen up.
Radiation's on its way from Denver.
If you don't have a basement,
you need to get to Town Hall.
There's a shelter there.
I'm not going to Town Hall.
Well, you don't have a choice, people.
You're being evacuated.
And who are you?
I'm the deputy mayor.
What, did your daddy make you a deputy?
Just forget it, Eric,
you've told everybody.
--Do you realize a nuclear bomb went off yesterday?
--So?
If I'm going to die in a nuclear blast, so be it.
I'm going to be right here
playing pool with my buddies.
But you're not going to die in a blast.
You're going to get radiation poisoning.
Within the first couple of hours
you're going to be vomiting
and have crippling diarrhea.
Your hair is going to fall out in chunks.
Your skin,
it's going to blister.
Your internal organs are going to start to shut down.
Because, well, frankly...
...they're being cooked from the inside.
You're going to get sicker and sicker
until you can't move.
And then you will die.
Over there on the floor by the pool table...
with your buddies.
Ooh.
Don't mind me.
Sit tight.
We'll be right back.
Sheriff, come in.
Come in, Sheriff, over.
Randall, no one's heard from the sheriff
since last night
There  was a prison bus out there.
I think we better assume the worst.
You're on your own.
What about Jimmy or Bill?
Deputies are missing, too.
You're just going to have
to handle this yourself.
Don't think we forgot you, did you?
--Anything wrong, Miss?
--No, nothing.
Doesn't look like anybody's here.
Yeah, well, the pump's locked, so...
You know, there is this other place
that I can take you to.
Look, we're running on fumes as it is.
Make a sound, you die.
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't think anybody's home.
Ms. Sullivan...
--What a surprise.
--Hey, Bonnie.
Oxygen tanks, IVs,
all non-electrical medical supplies.
--When was that written?
--1957.
The population of Jericho was 1,000 people.
I'll start moving everyone.
I'll get the ventilation system fixed.
God, they chewed through everything.
Mind if I pitch in?
You know how to strip wires?
Ever since junior high.
Yeah, I was that popular.
All right, great.
Check the fan belt,
I think it's frayed.
Well, then you might want to get another one.
Any mid-century American car would
be a good match.
And check the brushers.
--We don't want the motor to seize up.
--Okay.
All right.
You take over.
I'll look for a fan belt.
Excuse me, sir.
You're doing that wrong.
April.
She thinks we shouldn't move the baby.
Ma'am, your baby's protected
in this little bubble.
She's got fresh air and food.
Right now, she's the safest
person in Jericho
but you're not.
We need to make sure she has
a mother to take care of her
when this thing is over, okay?
Please.
--Please, let us take you both
down to the shelter, okay?
--Mm-hmm.
Okay.
--Bobby.
--Jake Green?
Just a second, ma'am.
--obby, there's two in the nursery.
--I'm Emily Sullivan's aunt.
...taken to the shelter in our basement.
Mrs. Dawson, hi.
--Have you seen Emily?
--No, not since yesterday.
Maybe she's at the other shelter.
No one over there has seen her
and she's not at her house.
I heard you were back in town
--and I figured the one person who would know...
--I'm sorry.
I have to go.
If I see her, I'll tell her
you're looking for her
but I'm sure she's fine.
So we'll just, uh,
use your pump and be on our way.
Stanley has the key.
What did she just say?
Oh... her brother, Stanley,
he's got the key to the pump.
Wait a minute,
--she's deaf?
--Yes.
I read lips.
--When do you think Stanley gets back?
--Another hour.
--Whoa, whoa, whoa.
--What did she just say?
It's going to be about an hour.
Oh, we can wait an hour, can't we?
Ms. Sullivan, you all right?
Yeah, fine.
I'm just hungry.
Yeah, uh...
Why don't we make some food for the officers?
Oh,  I want eggs.
It's a farmhouse,
you've got eggs, right?
Yeah, why don't we, uh...
Why don't we all go make something to eat?
Sure.
People south of Main
go to you at Town Hall?
Yeah, that's right,
all those to the north of Main Street
go to the medical center.
--Johnston.
--Right, yeah, I know, you want me
to take it easy.
--I'm just going to go help Eric
get the supplies from Gracie.
--I've already sent people to do that.
Gail, who is in charge here, you or me?
You do not want to play that game.
Here's every book we have in the library
about nuclear radiation.
--Our Friend The Atom.
--Some friend.
Anything in here for grownups?
I'd like to know what we're supposed to do
if this town gets hit.
None of the books are specific.
Atom bombs have only gone off in
populated cities twice in history.
And Denver was probably hit
by a hydrogen bomb, anyway.
What's the difference?
Hydrogen bombs, they literally
explode the air.
So, what you're saying
is that nobody knows
what's really coming?
Then we pick worst case scenario.
--What needs to be done?
--One second, sir, I have that.
Let me just...
Anything left outside
will have to be scrubbed down.
And if it rains, the top
18 inches or so of soil
will have to be removed before planting again.
And tell everybody to cover
all the water wells.
That's about what it says, right?
Yes. Yes, that's right.
Well, you heard the man.
Jeff, let's make sure all the ranchers
get the livestock inside.
I'm going to work on the radio.
This may be our last chance
to make contact for a while.
There's a bunch of people in the church.
They held a vigil there all night.
I'm going to make sure they get into shelter.
--Hurry back.
--Yes, ma'am.
--I'm telling you they need to be replaced.
--Listen, girlie...
Please, don't argue with me.
don't tell me...
The brushers are shot,
it's revving too high. It's...
Turn them off!
Jake, everyone's ready.
--What do we do now?
--Don't let them in here!
The rain's going to be here soon.
People are getting scared.
Do we have air or not?
You seal them up in here
they're going to die.
Hello,Dad
Dad, can you hear me?
Dad's checking on the church, Jake
What do you need?
Our shelter's no good.
I'm bringing these people to Town Hall.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
Jake, I don't know how many more
people we can hold.
--What about the basement?
--They don't have basements, Eric.
That's why they came here.
Eric, we've got 200 people here.
Some of them need medical attention.
Handle it.
Look, I will be at Town Hall soon.
I'll check to see how much room we have.
--And I will call you back.
--I don't have time. We're coming.
--Sorry, my husband needs a kick sometimes.
--You don't have to apologize to me.
I've got to go to the shelter.
Bring everything you can.
H-How much more do you need?
--Enough to feed half the town, Gracie.
--Half the town?
Wait--
--Skylar, you have to come to the shelter.
--I'm not going to some stupid shelter.
I'm going home to wait for my parents.
--Don't be crazy.
--I'm not crazy!
--I'm going home.
--Fine.
Excuse me, ladie
Are you going to pay for those?
What are you talking about?
Everybody is just taking stuff.
This is still my store.
Is that for an emergency?
All right, you know what?
Fine, keep it.
Her parents are in New York, okay?
Who knows if they're even going to come back.
--It was just a couple cans of soda.
--They're my soda.
I say we head east.
She was headed east, wasn't she?
Hey, how far from here
would you say those crows were?
About five miles west
from where you picked me up.
Hell, then we'll go north.
Hey.
You want to help me out with the coffee?
Yeah, I'll show you where it is.
You better get down to that shelter.
--The  wind is moving faster than we thought
--I'm watching it.
Just get everybody underground.
You know, if you get that thing to work,
just do me a favor, and find
out who did this to us.
--Eric, come in.
--This is Eric, go ahead.
A couple of busloads coming to Town Hall.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
People, please!
Don't get off the bus.
--We can't take any more.
--Eric, what the hell are you doing?
They can't come in here, Jake.
--What do you mean they can't come in here?
--We're packed!
What? I got a whole bus full of
people here that need shelter.
You're really gonna turn away
all these people, Eric?
You're going to turn away your wife?
We let everybody in,
we'll all suffocate.
Eric, there are really sick people here
and the storm is coming!
Okay, we can take ten.
And I saved a spot for you.
All right, the ten most critical, fast.
Gray, the salt mine,
how many people will it hold?
As many as you want,
--but I don't think...
--It has a ventilation system, right?
--Yeah, and water.
--All right, it's the best option
we have right now, all right?
Mom?
Have you seen your father?
He told me he was going to the church.
Well, Gail, people from that church got
back 20 minutes ago.
Eric?
Mom, we'll find Dad.
--Jake, take your people to the mine.
Leave us 10.
--I'll go with you, Jake.
After 27 years, nobody knows
that mine the way I do.
I guess you can fit 11 people now.
Yeah, make it 12.
It's my place--
I should be there.
Yeah, let's go.
Hey.
We're going to be okay.
Hang on.
--That smells good.
--Oh, no, no, I'll get it.
Oh!
--I am so sorry.
--Damn it.
Oh, that looks bad.
Look, go in the kitchen right now
and run cold water over it.
It'll stop it before the blisters.
I'll clean up this mess.
--What happened?
--She...
I burnt my hand.
You left her alone?
She's fine.
Is he okay?
He'll live.
I can only get 12 down
on the elevator at a time!
That's the best I can do!
Shep, we have to seal the entrance.
There's no door, Jake.
Well, we can't just let the rain
pour down the shaft.
These people won't be safe.
--We won't be safe.
--Well, how do we seal it?
I don't know, but it's a mine.
--You got dynamite, right?
--Whoa, whoa...
--We put charges here, here, here...
--Are you crazy?
How do we know we won't bring
the whole thing down on top of us?
We don't.
I am going to the little girls' room.
--Hey, where is that?
--Right up the stairs.
--Right there, see?
--Good to know.
Straight back!
--Eric, any sign of Dad?
--No, not yet.
Checked the church, Main Street.
We're going through every inch
of Town Hall right now.
Listen, Eric,
I'm going to need you
to bring a crew over here
and dig us out when this thing's over.
What? What? Why?
--We're ready, Jake!
--Are you crazy?
Just dig us out-- and find Dad, okay?
Let's go.
Mr. Hawkins, did my father come through here?
No, I haven't seen him.
--Mom, check the offices again.
--Maybe we missed something.
I'll go check out the parking lot.
--Look, we'll find him, okay?
--Okay. Be careful. Be careful.
Could you use some help, ma'am?
No, we need you on the radio.
You know, I can't get this old thing to work.
--Okay, come.
--Fine.
Please.
You are not in my house.
Get off my property, right now.
And my property goes all the way down the hill.
You need to get back to town.
The radiation's coming from Denver.
I'm not leaving here.
My parents are on their way back.
--You talked to them?
--No, freak, the phones are dead.
But I'm not leaving here without them.
All right, stay inside,
tape up the windows,
and don't use the water.
--Don't tell me what to do.
--I'm serious, Skylar.
Stay inside.
Dale?
Dale, stop!
Please.
Stay here.
It's not safe out there.
Please stay here.
Jody, where you at?
All right, everybody...
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take some of that out, all right?
Seal the entrance, not cause a cave-in.
Hey.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I knew a guy once.
Did you blow him up?
Hello? Is anyone here?
--How does that look?
--It's good, that'll do.
--How we coming, Gray?
--This is the last of 'em.
--I'm almost done here.
--Same here.
This is Emily Sullivan.
We're at the Richmond Ranch with Bonnie.
Please, help us.
Can you hear me?
Is there anybody there?
What was that?
Did you hear that?
--Somebody's on the radio.
--This is Emily Sullivan.
--I'm at the Richmond Ranch.
--Everybody be quiet!
There are men here with guns.
I think they might have
killed the sheriff. Hello?
Can you hear me?
Emily! Emily!
Emily, can you hear me?
Emily.
Come in, come in.
Come in, can you hear me?
Is there anyone out there?
Is there anyone on this channel?
Can anyone here me?
Shep, give me your keys.
--Jake, it's gonna start raining any minute now.
--Give me your keys, I can make it.
--All right.
--Jake, you're out of your mind.
Gray, get everybody down there, all right?
--Hey, Jake?
--What?
When everybody's down,
say "all clear."
"All clear," okay?
Almost ready, Jake, stand by.
Come on, come on.
Jake?
We're all clear.
Johnston? Johnston?
Gail...
Oh, my God.
Mr. Hawkins!
Mr. Hawkins!
Mr. Hawkins!
Where's the brother?
Where the hell's the girl?
I think they might have killed...
I think they might have killed the sheriffs.
Please, help us.
Hello. This is Emily Sullivan.
I'm looking for the Jericho Police Department.
Can you hear me?
Is there anyone out there?
Is there anybody on this channel?
There are men here with guns.
I think they might have killed the sheriff.
Please, somebody help us.
Run, Emily,
run.
Hey! Hey!
Stop!
Stop!
Think this through! Let her go!
No.
We just want gas.
Supplies, that's all this is about.
It's just about fuel.
Let her go.
Look.
Please, please, let her go.
No.
Is this what you want to see?
Are you ready to talk now, Miss?
Please, let her go.
April...
April, come here.
Hey, Dad, can you tell me what happened?
Sit down.
Here, sit him down.
I just found him on the floor in his office.
Did you hit your head?
All right.
Bonnie, take him to the storm cellar now!
Go, guys, go!
Emily, we've got to get inside.
Emily? Emily, hey.
It's going to be okay
All right? I promise.
Everything is going to be okay, all right?
We've got to gin now, babe.
Babe?
We've got to get inside
before the rain, okay?
Come with me.
Come on.
Run. Run.
Get inside!
--Hey, Dad.
--Hey. How you doing?
You comfortable?
Just like camping.
You hate camping.
Yep.
Where's Allison?
--She's up in her room.
--Samuel, go get Ali.
Yes, sir.
--Tell her I'm home.
--Yes, sir.
Robert. Robert.
--What's happening out there?
--I don't know.
You know.
--You always know something.
--Hey, hey...
You are alive, Darcy,
okay?
And the kids are safe.
You know, don't ask me questions.
I think my mom died yesterday.
I think my mom died yesterday, too.
I thought you were gone.
--Emily...
--Why are you here?
Trying to keep you safe.
It's never safe around you.

Précédemment dans Jéricho...
Jake Green !
Comment vas-tu mec ?
- Mais t'étais passé où ?
- Dans les parages...
Jake, personne ne reste
"dans les parages" pendant 5 ans !
Sérieusement...
Où t'étais passé ?
Hé, mon frère !
- Ce que tu as fait subir à cette famille...
- Johnston, pour l'amour de Dieu !
- Il aurait pu être...  - On pourrait passer une semaine à
parler de ce que j'aurais pu être, d'accord ?
- Reste un jour de plus !
- Je dois rentrer à San Diego d'ici demain.
Ok, il semblerait que l'explosion
vienne de l'ouest, peut-être de Denver.
- On est attaqués ?
- Ça pourrait être un essai, ou un accident.
Bonjour Dale.
Désolé de ne pas t'avoir appelé plus tôt mon ange,
mais on...
Oh mon Dieu !
Oh mon Dieu !!
Je suis vraiment navrée !
- Je ne savais pas que ta mère était à Denver...
- Elle était à Atlanta !
Oh mon Dieu !
- Ma mère est morte hier.
- Je crois que ma mère est morte hier, aussi.
Contacte April, on se retrouve au centre médical.
Il y a un bus carcéral vide là-dehors.
Ecoutez, je sais que vous dites aux gens que c'était un accident.
Mais si c'était une attaque, shérif !
C'est le chaos là-dehors.
Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises personnes sachent
que Jéricho est toujours là !
Riley !
Y a-t-il quelqu'un sur cette fréquence ?
Il y a des hommes ici avec des armes.
Je crois qu'ils ont tué le Shérif...
La pluie ne fera pas partir les radiations de l'air ?
- Oui, et l'apportera directement sur Jéricho
- Comment savez-vous pour les radiations, M. Hawkins ?
Parce que j'étais policier à Saint Louis.
Et après le 11 septembre,
nous avons dû monter en régime !
Combien de temps avant que les radiations arrivent ici ?
Combien de temps met normalement
une tempête pour arriver de Denver ?
Moins de deux heures.
Chacun ici peut aller à l'abri de la Mairie.
Tout ceux plus au nord iront à la clinique.
Notre abri n'est pas valable.
J'amène tout ces gens à la Mairie.
Ils ne peuvent pas entrer ici, Jake !
- Que veux-tu dire par "ils ne peuvent pas entrer ici" ?
- Nous sommes plein !!
La mine de sel, combien de personnes contiendrait-elle ?
Nous devons sceller l'entrée.
Il n'y a pas de porte, Jake.
Bien, nous ne debons pas laisser la pluie se déverser dans le conduit.
Ces gens ne seraient pas en sécurité.
La voie est libre !
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe là-dehors ?
- Je ne sais pas !
Tu sais toujours quelque chose...
Ecoute, ne me pose pas de questions.

JERICHO
Saison 1 - Episode 03
" Four Horsemen "
<i><b>18 HEURES APRES LES BOMBES </b></i>
Elle ne parle toujours pas.
Je vois ça.
Je veux dire, je suis flic.
Je n'ai jamais tué personne.
Elle est institutrice.
Où est Stanley ?
Jake, mon frère n'est pas au courant pour les radiations.
Quand la pluie s'arrêtera,
il reviendra, ne t'inquiète pas.
Bonnie, je connais Stanley, ça va aller.
Jake, j'ai ton frère en ligne.
- Il est avec ton père
- Enfin.
- Eric, comment va papa ?
- Il va bien.
L'abri de la Mairie est opérationnel.
<i>Ecoute, Jake, où es-tu ?</i>
<i>Je suis chez les Richmond.</i>
Dès que la pluie s'arrêtera,
prenez tous les outils que vous trouvererez
pour creuser, et allez à la mine.
<i>J'ai dû faire sauter l'entrée
pour empêcher la pluie d'entrer.</i>
<i>Ces gens ne doivent pas rester enfermés trop longtemps.</i>
Ce qui m'inquiéte le plus c'est que l'explosion pourrait
avoir envoyé quelques débris dans le ventilateur.
<i>Assez pour le ralentir ?</i>
<i>Assez pour le bloquer.</i>
<i>Nous devons les faire sortir !</i>
<i>Nous ne pouvons envoyer personne à la mine.
Nous n'avons aucun contact radio eux.</i>
Tiens chérie, prends une petite gorgée.
Voila, juste un peu, fais passer.
Bien, les enfants, bien !
Bien, bien, bien...
Une seconde !
Je reviens de suite !
Excusez-moi !
Hé !
- Comment vous sentez-vous ?
- Ho, Heather.
Je pense que nos élèves supporte ça mieux que moi.
Ils savent qu'il n'y a pas de quoi avoir peur.
Pour eux, c'est comme une mauvaise excursion.
Ça va aller.
- J'ai du mal à respirer.
- Ça va.
Tenez, prenez un peu d'eau !
Voilà.
Bien.
Il faut que je sorte.
Bientôt...
Bientôt...
- Est-ce que M. Rennie va bien ?
- Il va bien.
On doit juste lui laisser un peu plus d'espace, ok ?
Retourne là-bas.
Je ne peux pas !
- Je dois sortir !
- C'est bon.
Respirez profondément, respirez...
Tu vas bien ?
Question idiote ?
Bien.
Comment sais-tu que la pluie est radioactive ?
Denver, c'est pas la porte à coté.
Et bien, on ne sait combien de bombes ont explosé,
on ne sait pas...
C'etait quoi ?
Quelqu'un marche dans la maison..
Un autre prisonnier ?
- Stanley !
- Bonnie, merci mon Dieu !
Non !  Hey, hey !
Non !  Hé-Hé...
Stanley, ne la touche pas !
La pluie est peut-être radioactive.
<i>April, apparemment Stanley va bien.</i>
Il dit qu'il est resté sous la pluie environ 20 minutes.
Ouais , j'étais parti chez mon cousin,
pour l'aider à rentrer le bétail.
A-t-il des vomissements ?
<i>Non, rien.</i>
D'accord, avez-vous de l'iode ?
Bonnie, de l'iode ?
Et pour les blindés ?
Quels blindés ?
En revenant, j'ai doublé une file de blindés,
ils venaient de Denver.
Stanley, combien de tanks tu as vu ?
- Cinq, peut-être
- Où ?
Ils étaient après la crête, je peux pas te dire où exactement.
Mais j'étais sur la route de Pharr's Mill près de l'I-70.
April, nous avons de l'iode.
Il va devoir en prendre deux cuillères à soupe.
Mais ça a un goût infect, donc est-ce que tu as du pain,
ou quelque chose qu'il pourrait manger avec ?
On est dans une cave, tout ce qu'on a c'est des pêches
au sirop et des légumes au vinaigre...
Pas les légumes !
Peut-être les pêches.
Jake, donne-moi juste l'iode.
A la seconde même ou la pluie s'arrête,
envoyez-le directement à la clinique.
<i>Et, Jake...</i>
S'il vomit dans les deux prochains heures,
éloigne Bonnie de cette pièce.
Pourquoi ?
<i>Parce que... son frère sera en-train de mourrir.</i>
- Concentre-toi sur ta respiration, s'il te plaît !
- J'peux pas !
Je dois sortir d'ici !
- Je sais, bientôt !
- Je dois sortir d'ici !
M. Rennie, s'il vous plaît,
concentrez-vous sur votre respiration.
Regardez-moi !
Calmez-vous !
Très bien...
- Je dois sortir d'ici !
- Je sais, monsieur...
Je dois sortir d'ici !
Je ne veux pas mourrir là-dessous !
Sortez-moi de là !!
- Je ne veux pas être ici !
- Ecoutez, tout le monde se calme, ne vous faites pas de soucis !
- Vous effrayez les enfants, Scott
- Je ne peux plus respirer !
- Il est claustrophobe.
- Nous devons le sortir d'ici.
- Regarde, c'est moi !
- Je suis désolé.
C'est Shep,  essaye de te concentrer, mec !
- Essaye de te concentrer.
- Je dois sortir d'ici !
- Nous devons l'éloigner de ces gens
- Je dois sortir d'ici !
Je ne peux pas respirer !
- Je ne veux pas mourrir là-dessous !
- Faites attention svp !
S'il vous plaît !
Restez en arrière !
Je ne veux pas mourrir là-dessous !
Je ne veux pas...
Sortez moi d'ici !
- Jake veut vous parler.
- Sa toux empire.
- Je veux que vous fassiez court.
- Ok, ok...
Ouais, fils, qu'y a-t-il ?
Dad, Stanley a vu une ligne de blindés près de l'I-70
Bien, tu sais, il y a une unité de la Garde Nationale,
au sud-ouest, à Goodland.
Peut-être qu'ils étaient en entraînement ?
Il faut qu'on sorte et qu'on aille voir.
Ce pourrait être dangereux, fiston !
Je ne peux simplement pas rester assis
et attendre de découvrir ce qu'il se passe.
J'irai à Goodland, quelqu'un devrait vérifier Topeka.
D'accord, fils.
Je viens avec toi.
Quoi ?
Je dois trouver Roger,
et Goodland est sur la route de Wichita.
- Tu n'es pas en état pour...
J'y vais !
Seule, ou avec toi...
Pour la dernière fois...
On ne peux pas fumer ici.
- Eau pour tout le monde
- Merci, chéri !
- Johnston, j'ai besoin de prendre encore votre température.
- Oh, tu l'as prise y a cinq minutes à peine.
Elle n'a pas changé en cinq minutes.
- Le puissant Johnston Green terrassé par la grippe.
- Lui même !
Je ne sais pas si je te l'ai dis,
mais mon père est imperméable aux simples germes.
- Oh, vraiment ?
- Ouais, je crois que c'est ce que j'ai dit.
- La première inauguration, j'ai tout sur vidéo !
- C'était de l'humour...
J'essayais de...
April, ne fait jamais d'erreur,
cette famille ne te le pardonnerait jamais.
Okay, je m'en souviendrai.
<i>- Allez. - Mais... - Shh, Johnston.</i>
Je ne l'aime pas.
Moi non plus.
Tiens.
Ils sont un peu rassis.
Tu sais, je n'arrête pas de penser,
quand on était encore enfants,
comment ils nous entraînaient
a nous cacher sous nos bureau,
en cas d'attaque atomique.
Ouais, s'accroupir et se couvrir.
C'est la premiere chose à laquelle j'ai pensé,
quand j'ai vu le champignon atomique.
Ont-ils eu assez de temps pour se cacher sous leurs bureaux ?
C'est un peu stupide, hein ?
Non.
Eric ?
Je suis juste un peu confuse.
Ta femme n'agit vraiment pas comme quelqu'un,
qui sait que ce marriage est mort depuis longtemps.
- Mary...
- Ou, est-ce que je me tromperais ?
Mary, essayons juste de nous sortir de là, d'accord ?
Bon, la prochaine chose que tu vas me dire,
c'est qu'en fait elle te comprend.
Excuse-moi.
Jake, ne laisse pas Bonnie voir tes lèvres.
Ecoute, mec.
Si tout ça tourne mal...
le truc c'est que Bonnie est encore une enfant, alors...
- Stanley.
Ne dis pas ça, d'accord, Tout va bien se passer.
J'en suis pas sur.
J'ai la tête en vrac,
et je me sens comme si j'allais tout dégueuler.
Eric, la pluie s'est arrêtée.
C'est quoi ce truc noir ?
C'est tout ce qu'il reste de Denver.
- Bill, Emily, amenez Stanley à la clinique, tout de suite.
- D'accord.
Trouvez April, elle saura quoi faire.
- Jimmy, tu viens avec moi à la mine, d'accord ?
- Jake.
- Je pensais tout ce que je t'ai dit, d'accord ?
- Je sais.
Ecoute, je sais, je sais.
Je t'aiderai à trouver Roger.
Je te le promet, d'accord ?
Va, je te retrouve à la clinique.
Eric, on va à la mine maintenant.
On doit creuser et faire sortir ces gens.
C'était quoi ça ?
Je crois qu'il y a quelqu'un de l'autre côté.
Sortez ces gens de là.
Bon, tout le monde,
tout va bien se passer.
Bon, on a de la nouriture et de l'eau,
et il y a des bus qui vous attendent,
pour vous ammener à la clinique, d'accord ?
Doucement, et dans le calme.
Sortez en file indienne, ces gars vous aideront.
Ecoutez, vous êtes sauvés.
Les femmes et les enfants d'abord.
S'il vous plait ... faites attention
tout le monde, pas de bousculade.
<i>Ça va aller.</i>
- Tout va bien ?
- Je crois, oui.
Gray, que s'est-il passé ?
Il est mort.
Quoi ?
Hé.
- Hé, coment va Stanley?
- On est encore en train de l'ausculter.
Où est-il ?
- On a dû l'isoler.
- Où ? Où est-il ?
Mais qu'est-ce que ... ?
T'aime ça ?
C'est là qu'ils mettent les gamins contagieux en attente,
pour qu'ils ne refilent pas la vérole a tout le monde.
- Tu as vomis ?
- Oui, deux fois.
Apparement c'est ce qui arrive quand tu bois
une bouteille entière de teinture d'iode.
Je dois retourner à la maison.
Il faut que je vérifie le bétail.
Il faut que je vérifie le maïs.
Je dois sortir d'ici.
- Il n'y a rien que tu puisse faire, là tout de suite.
- Il a raison.
- Tu dois rester ici.
J'en ai ras le bol de me faire piquer toutes les dix minutes.
Ils vont le regretter, quand je vais leur botter le cul
avec mes pouvoirs à la spiderman.
Bon, t'es toujours un crétin, c'est plutôt bon signe.
Oui.
C'est mauvais à quel point ?
Et bien, vous êtes en manque de sommeil,
comme tout le monde.
Apportez des bandages à la 102.
Non, je veux dire les radiations.
Je suis en train de mourir ?
- Avez vous vomi ?
- Non. Je devrais ?
- Vous avez juste besoin de repos, rentrez chez vous.
- J'aimerais bien.
C'est quand le prochain vol pour Washington ?
Docteur Green ?
Bon, il y a beaucoups de gens qui attendent,
- Si vous pouviez....
- Je veux juste savoir ce qui est arrivé à mon ami.
Scott Rennie.
Une crise cardiaque, il semblerait.
Je suis désolée.
Mais...
Alors, ça veut dire quoi si j'ai trois reines,
mais que je n'ai que deux valets ?
- Je passe.
- Je t'ai bien bluffé.
- Skylar, tu es toujours vivante ?
<i>Sky, tu es là ?</i>
<i>Salut ?!</i>
<i>Hé mec, je crève de faim.</i>
- Ho, mon dieu.
- Qu'est ce qu'il fout là ?
Ce n'est pas ce que tu pense.
Je suis sure que si.
Skylar, attend.
Ce mec est cinglé.
Je peux pas rester ici à rien faire toute la journée.
On doit retrouver le Shérif et ses hommes,
- On doit remettre le courant.
- D'accord, mais tu vas rester ici, le temps que ça prendra.
Ne m'oblige pas à partir avec ton pantalon.
- Je peux me ballader dans cette ville sans mon pantalon.
- Ça ne sera pas la première fois.
- Hmm.
- D'accord.
Je ne veux pas en entendre plus sur cette histoire.
Mon coeur.
Comment vas tu, chéri ?
Un peu mal aux jambes, mais...
Comment vont les choses ici ?
- Ton père a la grippe.
- C'est rien.
Vous savez que M. Rennie est mort ?
C'est terrible.
J'étais en train de penser...
...que plus que tout,
cette ville a besoin d'informations.
On pourrait organiser des groupes de gens,
et les envoyer dans toutes les directions.
- Je pense pas que quiconque devrait quitter Jericho.
- Il le faut.
On ne peut pas rester ici dans l'ignorance.
Il a raison.
Cela nous rend trop vulnérable.
Abrams, toi et Crossfield vous allez prendre la route du nord,
jusqu'au Nebraska à la caserne de la police
d'état à Broken Bow.
Bon, moi je peux aller à l'est vers Topeka
et contacter le gouvernement d'état.
Ridley, tu peux aller vers l'ouest vers Denver.
Enfin... ce qu'il en reste.
Tu seras surement bloqué par les gens de la FEMA ou l'EMS,
avant même d'apercevoir la ville.
Demande-leur ce qu'ils savent.
Et toi ?
Il va à Wichita avec moi.
C'est ça, Emily et moi on va prendre la
route du Sud pour Wichita.
Bon, on essaye de s'échanger par radio,
autant d'information que possible le long de la route.
C'est ça le plan.
Atteindre les principales villes dans chaque direction,
au nord, au sud, à l'est, et à l'ouest.
- Les 4 cavaliers de l'apocalypse.
- Espérons que non.
Non, on a que du brouillard.
Essayez de l'orienter vers l'est.
On a rien,
continuez à la bouger.
Non, que du brouillard.
Continuez.
Mary.
S'il te plaît.
Mary.
Hé mec,
c'est la foule ici.
Ouais, même si le service n'est plus ce qu'il était.
Ce sera quoi ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
On a quelque chose !
<i>C'est parti ?
Allez, remettez-le !</i>
On perd le signal !
- Remettez-le !
- Revenez en arrière. On avait quelque chose.
C'était du Coréen ?
- Quelqu'un sait ?
- Je pense que c'était du Chinois.
C'était du Mandarin.
Ce qu'on sait pas, c'est si ils commentent seulement,
ou si ils sont derrière tout ça ?
- Est-ce que Stanley t'as dit s'il y avait des marques
sur les tanks ? - Non.
- Je veux dire que c'est peut-être une invasion.
- Abrams et Crossfield ont renoncé.
- Ils ne veulent pas rouler dans une zone de guerre.
- Ouais, ben, on peut pas leur en vouloir.
Ecoute, pourquoi on ne suspendrait pas ce plan pour l'instant ?
On a vu une image, on va surement en voir d'autres.
Aller voir ce qui se passe est plus important
que jamais, d'accord ?
Si ce pays est en guerre, on doit le savoir.
Bon, on a Los Angeles, Seattle et Philadephia.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as vu d'autre à la télé ?
- Je crois pas que c'était Seattle.
- Bien. Euh, ça pourrait être Portland ?
- Je pense pas.
Hé.
- Si j'ai bien compris, vous avez perdu des hommes ?
- Ouais.
Si vous avez besoin de volontaires, je suis partant.
- Merci, Monsieur...
- Hawkins.
M. Hawkins.
- Vous avez une famille ?
- Deux enfants.
Je pense qu'il vaut mieux qu'on s'organise,
avec ceux qui n'ont pas de familles.
Hé, Em ?
Excusez-moi.
M. Cale ?
Quelque chose me dérange.
A propos de la mort de M. Rennie.
Il y avait plein de gens de la clinique dans cette mine.
Pourquoi personne n'a appelé de docteur ?
Je ne veux pas en parler.
Je sais que cela vous travaille.
Vous étiez proche.
Mais c'était mon ami aussi. Je...
J'ai travaillé avec lui pendant 3 ans.
Hé, Shep ?
On va chercher du ravitaillement.
Tu peux nous donner un coup de main ?
Vous savez, tout ceci est vraiment très difficile pour Shep.
Il a perdu un ami aujourd'hui.
Comme nous tous.
Emily ?
Parle-moi.
C'est à cause de l'émission ?
Parce qu'on ne sait pas ce que ça signifie.
Ils ont eu Wichita.
Roger est mort.
- Ça, on ne sait pas.
- Je l'ai vu sur la carte.
- Ton fiancé à pu s'en sortir.
- Comment ?
Et si son vol avait pu être dérouté sur Des Moines ?
Des Moines a disparu aussi.
Emily, et si c'était Omaha, hein ?
Ou Tulsa ?
Et s'ils avaient pu se poser dans un
champ de blé dans le Nebraska?
Il peut-être n'importe où.
L'avion s'est écrasé en cherchant un endroit pour atterrir.
- Et s'il avait explosé ?
- Emily. - Et s'il était mort ?
- Il est parti, et je suis ici avec toi.
- Emily.
C'était toi qui était censé être mort ... pas lui.
Laisse moi seule, Jake.
Vas-y sans moi.
Ils ont tout pris.
Oh, Dale.
Dieu merci.
Je t'ai cherché partout.
Tu vas bien ?
Je me suis fait tant de soucis.
- J'étais à l'abri.
- Bien.
Gracie ?
Oh, qu'est-ce que c'est encore ?
Gracie ?
On est fermé, Gail.
- Je n'ai plus rien.
- C'est pour ça que je suis ici.
Des gars ont ramené des provisions de l'abri,
et j'ai pensé que ça te serait utile.
Ce n'est qu'une boîte.
Je n'ai plus rien à vendre.
J'attendais une livraison par le train de mardi.
Sans cette livraison, ces étagères vont rester
aussi vides qu'elles le sont maintenant.
Je n'ai même plus de congélateur.
- Toute cette nourriture va s'abimer très vite.
- Je sais, c'est pareil dans toute la ville.
J'ai besoin de cette livraison.
Mais on ne sait même pas si le courant va revenir.
Peut-être qu'on devrait la cuire.
- Quoi ?
- Oui, tout, il faut tout cuire.
Pendant que c'est encore bon à manger.
Vous allez bien ?
A part une exposition aux radiations, oui.
Vous vous êtes retrouvée sous la pluie aussi ?
Oh, mon Dieu, non.
J'ai... juste touché un bâtiment
quand nous sommes sortis de l'abri.
Oh.
Ecoutez, arrêtez de faire semblant.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
J'ai déjà fait l'audit dans votre ferme.
Pourquoi vous préocuper de moi ?
Peut-être que je suis plus sympa que vous.
D'accord.
Vous étiez sous la pluie ?
Ouais, à peu près 20 minutes.
- Et bien, vous avez l'air plutôt bien.
- Merci.
Je m'entraîne.
Ecoutez, euh...
vous savez, je pense que j'ai vécu le pire.
Donc tant que je vais bien,
vous n'avez pas à vous en faire.
Vous êtes très gentil.
- Mais vous devez toujours 180 000$ au fisc.
- Ouais, je sais.
Toutes les radios doivent être chargées à bloc.
On restera en contact autant qu'on pourra.
Gray, les longue-distance sont toutes
chargées, elles sont dans la réserve.
- Très bien, merci.
Ridley, tu peux aller...
..rassembler les compteurs Geiger et les torches ?
On se retrouve dehors.
Gray, je voulais juste vous dire,
à quel point j'apprécie tout ce que vous faites.
C'est vraiment courageux, et, euh...
toute la ville vous en remercie.
- Ouais, merci.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé là-bas ?
Je connais Scott Rennie depuis toujours.
Il est fort comme un boeuf.
Je peux...
Je peux pas croire qu'il soit mort.
C'était un homme bon.
- Une crise cardiaque à son âge.
- Ouais, et bien, ce n'est pas une attaque cardiaque qui l'a tué.
- Que voulez-vous dire ?
- Mauvaise organisation.
De quoi vous parlez ?
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est que rien de tout cela ne serait arrivé
si l'abri de la clinique avait été opérationnel.
- Vous allez devoir des explications à pas mal de gens.
- Bon, ça suffit.
Non, ce n'est vraiment pas fini.
Quand je reviendrai ici, il y aura une enquête.
Des centaines de gens auraient pu mourrir,
juste parce que vous n'avez pas été à la hauteur.
- Et si on parlait de tout ça dans mon bureau ?
- Vous n'avez pas été à la hauteur, et ça a tué Scott Rennie.
Dans mon bureau.
Maintenant.
Pour l'instant, tous ces gens ont besoin qu'on les dirige.
Je ne vous laisserai pas les diviser.
Et quand tout sera fini,
et si on est encore en vie,
vous pourrez toujours mener votre enquête à la con.
En attendant, si jamais je vous entend encore aborder ce sujet,
vous et moi, on aura un problème.
On s'est bien compris ?
- Où est Emily ?
- Elle ne vient pas.
Bien.
- Tu n'y vas pas seul, quand même ?
- Si.
Ne me jette pas ce regard.
- Quel regard ?
- Tu sais bien quel regard. Ce regard là.
Hé, je t'ai déjà vu partir 36 000 fois,
sans savoir si tu allais revenir.
J'ai mérité le droit de te jeter ce regard.
Je reviens.
Allons-y !
Ridley ?
Allez.
Shep ?
Il remplace Ridley.
Il va à Denver.
Tu n'as pas besoin de faire ça.
Et ta famille ?
Il faut que je sorte d'ici.
Shep, ça va passer.
Ha oui ?
Hé, Heather.
- Shep a laissé ça pour toi.
- Merci.
<i>"Chère Heather,</i>
<i>je veux que tu saches la vérité à propos de Scott Rennie.</i>
<i>C'était ma faute.</i>
<i>Gray voulait que je le fasse taire,</i>
<i>et son coeur a lâché.</i>
<i>J'aurais dû appeler un médecin,
mais j'avais trop peur.</i>
<i>Je l'ai laissé mourir.</i>
<i>Je ne me le pardonnerai jamais.</i>
<i>Tu étais une bonne amie de Scott.</i>
<i>Bien meilleure que moi.</i>
<i>Shep."</i>
Ils devraient avoir fait environ 75 kilomètres, maintenant.
Jake, tu m'entends toujours ?
Jake ?
Je l'ai perdu.
Shep, tu es là ? Shep ?
<i>Eric, fais moi une faveur.</i>
J'ai pas tout compris, Shep.
Tu peux répéter ?
<i>Dis lui que je suis désolé.</i>
<i>Dis à la famille que je suis désolé.</i>
Je te perds, Shep.
Hé, Gray, tu as entendu ça ?
Non.
Non, je n'ai rien entendu.
Je ne sais pas, ça...  ça doit faire 70 kilomètres.
D'accord, donc à peu près une heure...
Jake, que fais tu encore ici ?
Tu devrais déjà être à Wichita.
La route etait bloquée.
C'est quoi ça ?
C'est un enregistreur de vol.
- Je croyais qu'elles étaient censées être noires.
- Et bien, tu l'as eu où ?
Des pilotes ont essayé d'utiliser l'autoroute comme terrain
d'atterissage, mais les résultats sont pas terribles.
- C'est la seule que j'ai pu obtenir.
- Y avait-il des survivants ?
C'était un vol régulier qui s'est écrasé.
Et il y avait un 757, vide.
Et bien, où sont-ils ?
Où sont ils partis ?
Comment ça s'écoute ?
- T'as encore un vieux magnéto à bandes qui traîne ?
- Oui.
Il faut que ton père entende ça.
Je vais le chercher.
- Ça va ?
- Oui. Je suis un peu sur les nerfs.
Papa est là.
J'ai écouté presque tout l'enregistrement
de l'avion qui s'est écrasé.
Ce sont les 30 dernières secondes.
Il y a beaucoup de bruit de fond.
Tu peux entendre...
les conversations des pilotes des avions
qui se trouvaient dans cette zone.
Attends.
Les gamins.
Ah oui.
<i>Il y a quelqu'un sur cette fréquence ?
Aucune réponse du Contrôle Aérien !</i>
<i>J'attends vos instructions. Ray-27 en atterrissage d'urgence,
attendons instructions pour atterrir.</i>
<i>Volets à fond, ça va secouer.</i>
<i>Ici Chinook 116 heavy.
On a loupé notre atterrissage pour Kansas City, Contrôle.</i>
<i>Quelqu'un nous entend ?
Terminé.</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6, je vous écoute.</i>
<i>Bingo Fuel,</i>
<i>on a perdu tout les vols partant de Chicago.</i>
<i>J'ai essayé toutes les fréquences,
il n'y a personne là-bas...</i>
Ca veut dire quoi ?
Ils n'ont plus de kérosène et ne voient plus rien.
<i>Les gars, ici Primary 221.</i>
<i>J'ai un nuage en forme de champignon à 16 km
d'altitude quelque part au nord-ouest de Denver.</i>
<i>J'en vois deux ...</i>
<i>Un au dessus de Kansas City,
et un autre au sud quelque part au Texas.</i>
<i>- Quelqu'un a des nouvelles de la tour de contrôle ?
- Négatif. il n'y a plus de tour de contrôle, Chinook.</i>
Il dit qu'il n'y a plus d'aiguillage dans le ciel.
Il y a 10 000 avions qui ne peuvent pas atterrir.
Ca fait à peu près 1 million de personnes dans les airs.
<i>- Wow ! Ce sont des F-16, ça ?</i>
<i>Tout à fait. Vous avez un visuel ?</i>
<i>Affirmatif. Prime Missouri Guard.
131ème de Landburg.</i>
<i>Ces gars se barrent quelque part.</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.</i>
<i>On a trouvé une portion d'autoroute suffisament longue.</i>
<i>Suivez-nous. En attente.</i>
<i>Approche finale, attendez.
On y va.</i>
<i>Les volets, il en faut plus ...</i>
<i>Je perds le contrôle.</i>
<i>Je n'arrive pas à le tenir.</i>
<i>On tombe.</i>
<i>Tire ! Tire !
Je n'y arrive pas...</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.</i>
<i>On a trouvé une portion d'autoroute suffisament longue.</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.</i>
<i>Nous avons trouvé un...</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.
Trans Shore...</i>
<i>Nous avons trouvé une portion d'autoroute suffisamment...</i>
Emily, viens ici.
Roger était bien sur le vol Trans Shore 724, non ?
Oui.
Ecoute.
- "C'est une priorité..."
- Jake, c'est quoi ça ? - Ecoute.
<i>- "Mon co-pilote est aveugle..."
- Le Bruit de fond.</i>
<i>- Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.
- Ici Trans Shore 724.</i>
<i>Nous avons atterri dans un champ.
Le GPS n'a pas fonctionné.</i>
<i>Je pense que nous sommes au nord du Kansas.
Pas de blessures graves.</i>
Il est vivant. Il est vivant.
Robert ?
Il y a, euh, de la musique dehors.
- Oui.
- Oui, la fête.
Depuis ici, on aurait dit du Sam Cooke, mais euh,
ça pourrait très bien être Kenny Rogers.
Ho, Seigneur.
Robert, les enfants aimeraient y aller.
- A la fête ?
- Oui.
Nous ne sommes pas prêts.
- Robert.
- Non.
Non.
Et bien, je suis contente qu'il y ait eu assez à manger pour
tout le monde. Je regrette juste que personne n'ait dit merci.
Oh, ça semble délicieux.
Merci.
Elle semble vraiment aller mieux.
Tu l'as vraiment rendue heureuse.
Je lui devais bien ça.
Et bien, disons que nous sommes quittes.
Loin de là.
Tu n'as pas dit deux mots de la soirée.
Je suis à l'écoute.
On ne reverra sûrement pas Jericho
comme ça avant longtemps.
Il faut que j'y aille.
Quelle heure est-il ?
Un peu plus de minuit.
Tu dois vraiment partir ?
Oui, je ferais mieux d'y aller.

Précédemment dans Jéricho...
Jake Green !
Comment vas-tu mec ?
- Mais t'étais passé où ?
- Dans les parages...
Jake, personne ne reste
"dans les parages" pendant 5 ans !
Sérieusement...
Où t'étais passé ?
Hé, mon frère !
- Ce que tu as fait subir à cette famille...
- Johnston, pour l'amour de Dieu !
- Il aurait pu être...  - On pourrait passer une semaine à
parler de ce que j'aurais pu être, d'accord ?
- Reste un jour de plus !
- Je dois rentrer à San Diego d'ici demain.
Ok, il semblerait que l'explosion
vienne de l'ouest, peut-être de Denver.
- On est attaqués ?
- Ça pourrait être un essai, ou un accident.
Bonjour Dale.
Désolé de ne pas t'avoir appelé plus tôt mon ange,
mais on...
Oh mon Dieu !
Oh mon Dieu !!
Je suis vraiment navrée !
- Je ne savais pas que ta mère était à Denver...
- Elle était à Atlanta !
Oh mon Dieu !
- Ma mère est morte hier.
- Je crois que ma mère est morte hier, aussi.
Contacte April, on se retrouve au centre médical.
Il y a un bus carcéral vide là-dehors.
Ecoutez, je sais que vous dites aux gens que c'était un accident.
Mais si c'était une attaque, shérif !
C'est le chaos là-dehors.
Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises personnes sachent
que Jéricho est toujours là !
Riley !
Y a-t-il quelqu'un sur cette fréquence ?
Il y a des hommes ici avec des armes.
Je crois qu'ils ont tué le Shérif...
La pluie ne fera pas partir les radiations de l'air ?
- Oui, et l'apportera directement sur Jéricho
- Comment savez-vous pour les radiations, M. Hawkins ?
Parce que j'étais policier à Saint Louis.
Et après le 11 septembre,
nous avons dû monter en régime !
Combien de temps avant que les radiations arrivent ici ?
Combien de temps met normalement
une tempête pour arriver de Denver ?
Moins de deux heures.
Chacun ici peut aller à l'abri de la Mairie.
Tout ceux plus au nord iront à la clinique.
Notre abri n'est pas valable.
J'amène tout ces gens à la Mairie.
Ils ne peuvent pas entrer ici, Jake !
- Que veux-tu dire par "ils ne peuvent pas entrer ici" ?
- Nous sommes plein !!
La mine de sel, combien de personnes contiendrait-elle ?
Nous devons sceller l'entrée.
Il n'y a pas de porte, Jake.
Bien, nous ne debons pas laisser la pluie se déverser dans le conduit.
Ces gens ne seraient pas en sécurité.
La voie est libre !
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe là-dehors ?
- Je ne sais pas !
Tu sais toujours quelque chose...
Ecoute, ne me pose pas de questions.

" Four Horsemen "
<i><b>18 HEURES APRES LES BOMBES </b></i>
Elle ne parle toujours pas.
Je vois ça.
Je veux dire, je suis flic.
Je n'ai jamais tué personne.
Elle est institutrice.
Où est Stanley ?
Jake, mon frère n'est pas au courant pour les radiations.
Quand la pluie s'arrêtera,
il reviendra, ne t'inquiète pas.
Bonnie, je connais Stanley, ça va aller.
Jake, j'ai ton frère en ligne.
- Il est avec ton père
- Enfin.
- Eric, comment va papa ?
- Il va bien.
L'abri de la Mairie est opérationnel.
<i>Ecoute, Jake, où es-tu ?</i>
<i>Je suis chez les Richmond.</i>
Dès que la pluie s'arrêtera,
prenez tous les outils que vous trouvererez
pour creuser, et allez à la mine.
<i>J'ai dû faire sauter l'entrée
pour empêcher la pluie d'entrer.</i>
<i>Ces gens ne doivent pas rester enfermés trop longtemps.</i>
Ce qui m'inquiéte le plus c'est que l'explosion pourrait
avoir envoyé quelques débris dans le ventilateur.
<i>Assez pour le ralentir ?</i>
<i>Assez pour le bloquer.</i>
<i>Nous devons les faire sortir !</i>
<i>Nous ne pouvons envoyer personne à la mine.
Nous n'avons aucun contact radio eux.</i>
Tiens chérie, prends une petite gorgée.
Voila, juste un peu, fais passer.
Bien, les enfants, bien !
Bien, bien, bien...
Une seconde !
Je reviens de suite !
Excusez-moi !
Hé !
- Comment vous sentez-vous ?
- Ho, Heather.
Je pense que nos élèves supporte ça mieux que moi.
Ils savent qu'il n'y a pas de quoi avoir peur.
Pour eux, c'est comme une mauvaise excursion.
Ça va aller.
- J'ai du mal à respirer.
- Ça va.
Tenez, prenez un peu d'eau !
Voilà.
Bien.
Il faut que je sorte.
Bientôt...
Bientôt...
- Est-ce que M. Rennie va bien ?
- Il va bien.
On doit juste lui laisser un peu plus d'espace, ok ?
Retourne là-bas.
Je ne peux pas !
- Je dois sortir !
- C'est bon.
Respirez profondément, respirez...
Tu vas bien ?
Question idiote ?
Bien.
Comment sais-tu que la pluie est radioactive ?
Denver, c'est pas la porte à coté.
Et bien, on ne sait combien de bombes ont explosé,
on ne sait pas...
C'etait quoi ?
Quelqu'un marche dans la maison..
Un autre prisonnier ?
- Stanley !
- Bonnie, merci mon Dieu !
Non !  Hey, hey !
Non !  Hé-Hé...
Stanley, ne la touche pas !
La pluie est peut-être radioactive.
<i>April, apparemment Stanley va bien.</i>
Il dit qu'il est resté sous la pluie environ 20 minutes.
Ouais , j'étais parti chez mon cousin,
pour l'aider à rentrer le bétail.
A-t-il des vomissements ?
<i>Non, rien.</i>
D'accord, avez-vous de l'iode ?
Bonnie, de l'iode ?
Et pour les blindés ?
Quels blindés ?
En revenant, j'ai doublé une file de blindés,
ils venaient de Denver.
Stanley, combien de tanks tu as vu ?
- Cinq, peut-être
- Où ?
Ils étaient après la crête, je peux pas te dire où exactement.
Mais j'étais sur la route de Pharr's Mill près de l'I-70.
April, nous avons de l'iode.
Il va devoir en prendre deux cuillères à soupe.
Mais ça a un goût infect, donc est-ce que tu as du pain,
ou quelque chose qu'il pourrait manger avec ?
On est dans une cave, tout ce qu'on a c'est des pêches
au sirop et des légumes au vinaigre...
Pas les légumes !
Peut-être les pêches.
Jake, donne-moi juste l'iode.
A la seconde même ou la pluie s'arrête,
envoyez-le directement à la clinique.
<i>Et, Jake...</i>
S'il vomit dans les deux prochains heures,
éloigne Bonnie de cette pièce.
Pourquoi ?
<i>Parce que... son frère sera en-train de mourrir.</i>
- Concentre-toi sur ta respiration, s'il te plaît !
- J'peux pas !
Je dois sortir d'ici !
- Je sais, bientôt !
- Je dois sortir d'ici !
M. Rennie, s'il vous plaît,
concentrez-vous sur votre respiration.
Regardez-moi !
Calmez-vous !
Très bien...
- Je dois sortir d'ici !
- Je sais, monsieur...
Je dois sortir d'ici !
Je ne veux pas mourrir là-dessous !
Sortez-moi de là !!
- Je ne veux pas être ici !
- Ecoutez, tout le monde se calme, ne vous faites pas de soucis !
- Vous effrayez les enfants, Scott
- Je ne peux plus respirer !
- Il est claustrophobe.
- Nous devons le sortir d'ici.
- Regarde, c'est moi !
- Je suis désolé.
C'est Shep,  essaye de te concentrer, mec !
- Essaye de te concentrer.
- Je dois sortir d'ici !
- Nous devons l'éloigner de ces gens
- Je dois sortir d'ici !
Je ne peux pas respirer !
- Je ne veux pas mourrir là-dessous !
- Faites attention svp !
S'il vous plaît !
Restez en arrière !
Je ne veux pas mourrir là-dessous !
Je ne veux pas...
Sortez moi d'ici !
- Jake veut vous parler.
- Sa toux empire.
- Je veux que vous fassiez court.
- Ok, ok...
Ouais, fils, qu'y a-t-il ?
Dad, Stanley a vu une ligne de blindés près de l'I-70
Bien, tu sais, il y a une unité de la Garde Nationale,
au sud-ouest, à Goodland.
Peut-être qu'ils étaient en entraînement ?
Il faut qu'on sorte et qu'on aille voir.
Ce pourrait être dangereux, fiston !
Je ne peux simplement pas rester assis
et attendre de découvrir ce qu'il se passe.
J'irai à Goodland, quelqu'un devrait vérifier Topeka.
D'accord, fils.
Je viens avec toi.
Quoi ?
Je dois trouver Roger,
et Goodland est sur la route de Wichita.
- Tu n'es pas en état pour...
J'y vais !
Seule, ou avec toi...
Pour la dernière fois...
On ne peux pas fumer ici.
- Eau pour tout le monde
- Merci, chéri !
- Johnston, j'ai besoin de prendre encore votre température.
- Oh, tu l'as prise y a cinq minutes à peine.
Elle n'a pas changé en cinq minutes.
- Le puissant Johnston Green terrassé par la grippe.
- Lui même !
Je ne sais pas si je te l'ai dis,
mais mon père est imperméable aux simples germes.
- Oh, vraiment ?
- Ouais, je crois que c'est ce que j'ai dit.
- La première inauguration, j'ai tout sur vidéo !
- C'était de l'humour...
J'essayais de...
April, ne fait jamais d'erreur,
cette famille ne te le pardonnerait jamais.
Okay, je m'en souviendrai.
<i>- Allez. - Mais... - Shh, Johnston.</i>
Je ne l'aime pas.
Moi non plus.
Tiens.
Ils sont un peu rassis.
Tu sais, je n'arrête pas de penser,
quand on était encore enfants,
comment ils nous entraînaient
a nous cacher sous nos bureau,
en cas d'attaque atomique.
Ouais, s'accroupir et se couvrir.
C'est la premiere chose à laquelle j'ai pensé,
quand j'ai vu le champignon atomique.
Ont-ils eu assez de temps pour se cacher sous leurs bureaux ?
C'est un peu stupide, hein ?
Non.
Eric ?
Je suis juste un peu confuse.
Ta femme n'agit vraiment pas comme quelqu'un,
qui sait que ce marriage est mort depuis longtemps.
- Mary...
- Ou, est-ce que je me tromperais ?
Mary, essayons juste de nous sortir de là, d'accord ?
Bon, la prochaine chose que tu vas me dire,
c'est qu'en fait elle te comprend.
Excuse-moi.
Jake, ne laisse pas Bonnie voir tes lèvres.
Ecoute, mec.
Si tout ça tourne mal...
le truc c'est que Bonnie est encore une enfant, alors...
- Stanley.
Ne dis pas ça, d'accord, Tout va bien se passer.
J'en suis pas sur.
J'ai la tête en vrac,
et je me sens comme si j'allais tout dégueuler.
Eric, la pluie s'est arrêtée.
C'est quoi ce truc noir ?
C'est tout ce qu'il reste de Denver.
- Bill, Emily, amenez Stanley à la clinique, tout de suite.
- D'accord.
Trouvez April, elle saura quoi faire.
- Jimmy, tu viens avec moi à la mine, d'accord ?
- Jake.
- Je pensais tout ce que je t'ai dit, d'accord ?
- Je sais.
Ecoute, je sais, je sais.
Je t'aiderai à trouver Roger.
Je te le promet, d'accord ?
Va, je te retrouve à la clinique.
Eric, on va à la mine maintenant.
On doit creuser et faire sortir ces gens.
C'était quoi ça ?
Je crois qu'il y a quelqu'un de l'autre côté.
Sortez ces gens de là.
Bon, tout le monde,
tout va bien se passer.
Bon, on a de la nouriture et de l'eau,
et il y a des bus qui vous attendent,
pour vous ammener à la clinique, d'accord ?
Doucement, et dans le calme.
Sortez en file indienne, ces gars vous aideront.
Ecoutez, vous êtes sauvés.
Les femmes et les enfants d'abord.
S'il vous plait ... faites attention
tout le monde, pas de bousculade.
<i>Ça va aller.</i>
- Tout va bien ?
- Je crois, oui.
Gray, que s'est-il passé ?
Il est mort.
Quoi ?
Hé.
- Hé, coment va Stanley?
- On est encore en train de l'ausculter.
Où est-il ?
- On a dû l'isoler.
- Où ? Où est-il ?
Mais qu'est-ce que ... ?
T'aime ça ?
C'est là qu'ils mettent les gamins contagieux en attente,
pour qu'ils ne refilent pas la vérole a tout le monde.
- Tu as vomis ?
- Oui, deux fois.
Apparement c'est ce qui arrive quand tu bois
une bouteille entière de teinture d'iode.
Je dois retourner à la maison.
Il faut que je vérifie le bétail.
Il faut que je vérifie le maïs.
Je dois sortir d'ici.
- Il n'y a rien que tu puisse faire, là tout de suite.
- Il a raison.
- Tu dois rester ici.
J'en ai ras le bol de me faire piquer toutes les dix minutes.
Ils vont le regretter, quand je vais leur botter le cul
avec mes pouvoirs à la spiderman.
Bon, t'es toujours un crétin, c'est plutôt bon signe.
Oui.
C'est mauvais à quel point ?
Et bien, vous êtes en manque de sommeil,
comme tout le monde.
Apportez des bandages à la 102.
Non, je veux dire les radiations.
Je suis en train de mourir ?
- Avez vous vomi ?
- Non. Je devrais ?
- Vous avez juste besoin de repos, rentrez chez vous.
- J'aimerais bien.
C'est quand le prochain vol pour Washington ?
Docteur Green ?
Bon, il y a beaucoups de gens qui attendent,
- Si vous pouviez....
- Je veux juste savoir ce qui est arrivé à mon ami.
Scott Rennie.
Une crise cardiaque, il semblerait.
Je suis désolée.
Mais...
Alors, ça veut dire quoi si j'ai trois reines,
mais que je n'ai que deux valets ?
- Je passe.
- Je t'ai bien bluffé.
- Skylar, tu es toujours vivante ?
<i>Sky, tu es là ?</i>
<i>Salut ?!</i>
<i>Hé mec, je crève de faim.</i>
- Ho, mon dieu.
- Qu'est ce qu'il fout là ?
Ce n'est pas ce que tu pense.
Je suis sure que si.
Skylar, attend.
Ce mec est cinglé.
Je peux pas rester ici à rien faire toute la journée.
On doit retrouver le Shérif et ses hommes,
- On doit remettre le courant.
- D'accord, mais tu vas rester ici, le temps que ça prendra.
Ne m'oblige pas à partir avec ton pantalon.
- Je peux me ballader dans cette ville sans mon pantalon.
- Ça ne sera pas la première fois.
- Hmm.
- D'accord.
Je ne veux pas en entendre plus sur cette histoire.
Mon coeur.
Comment vas tu, chéri ?
Un peu mal aux jambes, mais...
Comment vont les choses ici ?
- Ton père a la grippe.
- C'est rien.
Vous savez que M. Rennie est mort ?
C'est terrible.
J'étais en train de penser...
...que plus que tout,
cette ville a besoin d'informations.
On pourrait organiser des groupes de gens,
et les envoyer dans toutes les directions.
- Je pense pas que quiconque devrait quitter Jericho.
- Il le faut.
On ne peut pas rester ici dans l'ignorance.
Il a raison.
Cela nous rend trop vulnérable.
Abrams, toi et Crossfield vous allez prendre la route du nord,
jusqu'au Nebraska à la caserne de la police
d'état à Broken Bow.
Bon, moi je peux aller à l'est vers Topeka
et contacter le gouvernement d'état.
Ridley, tu peux aller vers l'ouest vers Denver.
Enfin... ce qu'il en reste.
Tu seras surement bloqué par les gens de la FEMA ou l'EMS,
avant même d'apercevoir la ville.
Demande-leur ce qu'ils savent.
Et toi ?
Il va à Wichita avec moi.
C'est ça, Emily et moi on va prendre la
route du Sud pour Wichita.
Bon, on essaye de s'échanger par radio,
autant d'information que possible le long de la route.
C'est ça le plan.
Atteindre les principales villes dans chaque direction,
au nord, au sud, à l'est, et à l'ouest.
- Les 4 cavaliers de l'apocalypse.
- Espérons que non.
Non, on a que du brouillard.
Essayez de l'orienter vers l'est.
On a rien,
continuez à la bouger.
Non, que du brouillard.
Continuez.
Mary.
S'il te plaît.
Mary.
Hé mec,
c'est la foule ici.
Ouais, même si le service n'est plus ce qu'il était.
Ce sera quoi ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
On a quelque chose !
<i>C'est parti ?
Allez, remettez-le !</i>
On perd le signal !
- Remettez-le !
- Revenez en arrière. On avait quelque chose.
C'était du Coréen ?
- Quelqu'un sait ?
- Je pense que c'était du Chinois.
C'était du Mandarin.
Ce qu'on sait pas, c'est si ils commentent seulement,
ou si ils sont derrière tout ça ?
- Est-ce que Stanley t'as dit s'il y avait des marques
sur les tanks ? - Non.
- Je veux dire que c'est peut-être une invasion.
- Abrams et Crossfield ont renoncé.
- Ils ne veulent pas rouler dans une zone de guerre.
- Ouais, ben, on peut pas leur en vouloir.
Ecoute, pourquoi on ne suspendrait pas ce plan pour l'instant ?
On a vu une image, on va surement en voir d'autres.
Aller voir ce qui se passe est plus important
que jamais, d'accord ?
Si ce pays est en guerre, on doit le savoir.
Bon, on a Los Angeles, Seattle et Philadephia.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as vu d'autre à la télé ?
- Je crois pas que c'était Seattle.
- Bien. Euh, ça pourrait être Portland ?
- Je pense pas.
Hé.
- Si j'ai bien compris, vous avez perdu des hommes ?
- Ouais.
Si vous avez besoin de volontaires, je suis partant.
- Merci, Monsieur...
- Hawkins.
M. Hawkins.
- Vous avez une famille ?
- Deux enfants.
Je pense qu'il vaut mieux qu'on s'organise,
avec ceux qui n'ont pas de familles.
Hé, Em ?
Excusez-moi.
M. Cale ?
Quelque chose me dérange.
A propos de la mort de M. Rennie.
Il y avait plein de gens de la clinique dans cette mine.
Pourquoi personne n'a appelé de docteur ?
Je ne veux pas en parler.
Je sais que cela vous travaille.
Vous étiez proche.
Mais c'était mon ami aussi. Je...
J'ai travaillé avec lui pendant 3 ans.
Hé, Shep ?
On va chercher du ravitaillement.
Tu peux nous donner un coup de main ?
Vous savez, tout ceci est vraiment très difficile pour Shep.
Il a perdu un ami aujourd'hui.
Comme nous tous.
Emily ?
Parle-moi.
C'est à cause de l'émission ?
Parce qu'on ne sait pas ce que ça signifie.
Ils ont eu Wichita.
Roger est mort.
- Ça, on ne sait pas.
- Je l'ai vu sur la carte.
- Ton fiancé à pu s'en sortir.
- Comment ?
Et si son vol avait pu être dérouté sur Des Moines ?
Des Moines a disparu aussi.
Emily, et si c'était Omaha, hein ?
Ou Tulsa ?
Et s'ils avaient pu se poser dans un
champ de blé dans le Nebraska?
Il peut-être n'importe où.
L'avion s'est écrasé en cherchant un endroit pour atterrir.
- Et s'il avait explosé ?
- Emily. - Et s'il était mort ?
- Il est parti, et je suis ici avec toi.
- Emily.
C'était toi qui était censé être mort ... pas lui.
Laisse moi seule, Jake.
Vas-y sans moi.
Ils ont tout pris.
Oh, Dale.
Dieu merci.
Je t'ai cherché partout.
Tu vas bien ?
Je me suis fait tant de soucis.
- J'étais à l'abri.
- Bien.
Gracie ?
Oh, qu'est-ce que c'est encore ?
Gracie ?
On est fermé, Gail.
- Je n'ai plus rien.
- C'est pour ça que je suis ici.
Des gars ont ramené des provisions de l'abri,
et j'ai pensé que ça te serait utile.
Ce n'est qu'une boîte.
Je n'ai plus rien à vendre.
J'attendais une livraison par le train de mardi.
Sans cette livraison, ces étagères vont rester
aussi vides qu'elles le sont maintenant.
Je n'ai même plus de congélateur.
- Toute cette nourriture va s'abimer très vite.
- Je sais, c'est pareil dans toute la ville.
J'ai besoin de cette livraison.
Mais on ne sait même pas si le courant va revenir.
Peut-être qu'on devrait la cuire.
- Quoi ?
- Oui, tout, il faut tout cuire.
Pendant que c'est encore bon à manger.
Vous allez bien ?
A part une exposition aux radiations, oui.
Vous vous êtes retrouvée sous la pluie aussi ?
Oh, mon Dieu, non.
J'ai... juste touché un bâtiment
quand nous sommes sortis de l'abri.
Oh.
Ecoutez, arrêtez de faire semblant.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
J'ai déjà fait l'audit dans votre ferme.
Pourquoi vous préocuper de moi ?
Peut-être que je suis plus sympa que vous.
D'accord.
Vous étiez sous la pluie ?
Ouais, à peu près 20 minutes.
- Et bien, vous avez l'air plutôt bien.
- Merci.
Je m'entraîne.
Ecoutez, euh...
vous savez, je pense que j'ai vécu le pire.
Donc tant que je vais bien,
vous n'avez pas à vous en faire.
Vous êtes très gentil.
- Mais vous devez toujours 180 000$ au fisc.
- Ouais, je sais.
Toutes les radios doivent être chargées à bloc.
On restera en contact autant qu'on pourra.
Gray, les longue-distance sont toutes
chargées, elles sont dans la réserve.
- Très bien, merci.
Ridley, tu peux aller...
..rassembler les compteurs Geiger et les torches ?
On se retrouve dehors.
Gray, je voulais juste vous dire,
à quel point j'apprécie tout ce que vous faites.
C'est vraiment courageux, et, euh...
toute la ville vous en remercie.
- Ouais, merci.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé là-bas ?
Je connais Scott Rennie depuis toujours.
Il est fort comme un boeuf.
Je peux...
Je peux pas croire qu'il soit mort.
C'était un homme bon.
- Une crise cardiaque à son âge.
- Ouais, et bien, ce n'est pas une attaque cardiaque qui l'a tué.
- Que voulez-vous dire ?
- Mauvaise organisation.
De quoi vous parlez ?
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est que rien de tout cela ne serait arrivé
si l'abri de la clinique avait été opérationnel.
- Vous allez devoir des explications à pas mal de gens.
- Bon, ça suffit.
Non, ce n'est vraiment pas fini.
Quand je reviendrai ici, il y aura une enquête.
Des centaines de gens auraient pu mourrir,
juste parce que vous n'avez pas été à la hauteur.
- Et si on parlait de tout ça dans mon bureau ?
- Vous n'avez pas été à la hauteur, et ça a tué Scott Rennie.
Dans mon bureau.
Maintenant.
Pour l'instant, tous ces gens ont besoin qu'on les dirige.
Je ne vous laisserai pas les diviser.
Et quand tout sera fini,
et si on est encore en vie,
vous pourrez toujours mener votre enquête à la con.
En attendant, si jamais je vous entend encore aborder ce sujet,
vous et moi, on aura un problème.
On s'est bien compris ?
- Où est Emily ?
- Elle ne vient pas.
Bien.
- Tu n'y vas pas seul, quand même ?
- Si.
Ne me jette pas ce regard.
- Quel regard ?
- Tu sais bien quel regard. Ce regard là.
Hé, je t'ai déjà vu partir 36 000 fois,
sans savoir si tu allais revenir.
J'ai mérité le droit de te jeter ce regard.
Je reviens.
Allons-y !
Ridley ?
Allez.
Shep ?
Il remplace Ridley.
Il va à Denver.
Tu n'as pas besoin de faire ça.
Et ta famille ?
Il faut que je sorte d'ici.
Shep, ça va passer.
Ha oui ?
Hé, Heather.
- Shep a laissé ça pour toi.
- Merci.
<i>"Chère Heather,</i>
<i>je veux que tu saches la vérité à propos de Scott Rennie.</i>
<i>C'était ma faute.</i>
<i>Gray voulait que je le fasse taire,</i>
<i>et son coeur a lâché.</i>
<i>J'aurais dû appeler un médecin,
mais j'avais trop peur.</i>
<i>Je l'ai laissé mourir.</i>
<i>Je ne me le pardonnerai jamais.</i>
<i>Tu étais une bonne amie de Scott.</i>
<i>Bien meilleure que moi.</i>
<i>Shep."</i>
Ils devraient avoir fait environ 75 kilomètres, maintenant.
Jake, tu m'entends toujours ?
Jake ?
Je l'ai perdu.
Shep, tu es là ? Shep ?
<i>Eric, fais moi une faveur.</i>
J'ai pas tout compris, Shep.
Tu peux répéter ?
<i>Dis lui que je suis désolé.</i>
<i>Dis à la famille que je suis désolé.</i>
Je te perds, Shep.
Hé, Gray, tu as entendu ça ?
Non.
Non, je n'ai rien entendu.
Je ne sais pas, ça...  ça doit faire 70 kilomètres.
D'accord, donc à peu près une heure...
Jake, que fais tu encore ici ?
Tu devrais déjà être à Wichita.
La route etait bloquée.
C'est quoi ça ?
C'est un enregistreur de vol.
- Je croyais qu'elles étaient censées être noires.
- Et bien, tu l'as eu où ?
Des pilotes ont essayé d'utiliser l'autoroute comme terrain
d'atterissage, mais les résultats sont pas terribles.
- C'est la seule que j'ai pu obtenir.
- Y avait-il des survivants ?
C'était un vol régulier qui s'est écrasé.
Et il y avait un 757, vide.
Et bien, où sont-ils ?
Où sont ils partis ?
Comment ça s'écoute ?
- T'as encore un vieux magnéto à bandes qui traîne ?
- Oui.
Il faut que ton père entende ça.
Je vais le chercher.
- Ça va ?
- Oui. Je suis un peu sur les nerfs.
Papa est là.
J'ai écouté presque tout l'enregistrement
de l'avion qui s'est écrasé.
Ce sont les 30 dernières secondes.
Il y a beaucoup de bruit de fond.
Tu peux entendre...
les conversations des pilotes des avions
qui se trouvaient dans cette zone.
Attends.
Les gamins.
Ah oui.
<i>Il y a quelqu'un sur cette fréquence ?
Aucune réponse du Contrôle Aérien !</i>
<i>J'attends vos instructions. Ray-27 en atterrissage d'urgence,
attendons instructions pour atterrir.</i>
<i>Volets à fond, ça va secouer.</i>
<i>Ici Chinook 116 heavy.
On a loupé notre atterrissage pour Kansas City, Contrôle.</i>
<i>Quelqu'un nous entend ?
Terminé.</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6, je vous écoute.</i>
<i>Bingo Fuel,</i>
<i>on a perdu tout les vols partant de Chicago.</i>
<i>J'ai essayé toutes les fréquences,
il n'y a personne là-bas...</i>
Ca veut dire quoi ?
Ils n'ont plus de kérosène et ne voient plus rien.
<i>Les gars, ici Primary 221.</i>
<i>J'ai un nuage en forme de champignon à 16 km
d'altitude quelque part au nord-ouest de Denver.</i>
<i>J'en vois deux ...</i>
<i>Un au dessus de Kansas City,
et un autre au sud quelque part au Texas.</i>
<i>- Quelqu'un a des nouvelles de la tour de contrôle ?
- Négatif. il n'y a plus de tour de contrôle, Chinook.</i>
Il dit qu'il n'y a plus d'aiguillage dans le ciel.
Il y a 10 000 avions qui ne peuvent pas atterrir.
Ca fait à peu près 1 million de personnes dans les airs.
<i>- Wow ! Ce sont des F-16, ça ?</i>
<i>Tout à fait. Vous avez un visuel ?</i>
<i>Affirmatif. Prime Missouri Guard.
131ème de Landburg.</i>
<i>Ces gars se barrent quelque part.</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.</i>
<i>On a trouvé une portion d'autoroute suffisament longue.</i>
<i>Suivez-nous. En attente.</i>
<i>Approche finale, attendez.
On y va.</i>
<i>Les volets, il en faut plus ...</i>
<i>Je perds le contrôle.</i>
<i>Je n'arrive pas à le tenir.</i>
<i>On tombe.</i>
<i>Tire ! Tire !
Je n'y arrive pas...</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.</i>
<i>On a trouvé une portion d'autoroute suffisament longue.</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.</i>
<i>Nous avons trouvé un...</i>
<i>Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.
Trans Shore...</i>
<i>Nous avons trouvé une portion d'autoroute suffisamment...</i>
Emily, viens ici.
Roger était bien sur le vol Trans Shore 724, non ?
Oui.
Ecoute.
- "C'est une priorité..."
- Jake, c'est quoi ça ? - Ecoute.
<i>- "Mon co-pilote est aveugle..."
- Le Bruit de fond.</i>
<i>- Chinook 116, ici Glen 5-6.
- Ici Trans Shore 724.</i>
<i>Nous avons atterri dans un champ.
Le GPS n'a pas fonctionné.</i>
<i>Je pense que nous sommes au nord du Kansas.
Pas de blessures graves.</i>
Il est vivant. Il est vivant.
Robert ?
Il y a, euh, de la musique dehors.
- Oui.
- Oui, la fête.
Depuis ici, on aurait dit du Sam Cooke, mais euh,
ça pourrait très bien être Kenny Rogers.
Ho, Seigneur.
Robert, les enfants aimeraient y aller.
- A la fête ?
- Oui.
Nous ne sommes pas prêts.
- Robert.
- Non.
Non.
Et bien, je suis contente qu'il y ait eu assez à manger pour
tout le monde. Je regrette juste que personne n'ait dit merci.
Oh, ça semble délicieux.
Merci.
Elle semble vraiment aller mieux.
Tu l'as vraiment rendue heureuse.
Je lui devais bien ça.
Et bien, disons que nous sommes quittes.
Loin de là.
Tu n'as pas dit deux mots de la soirée.
Je suis à l'écoute.
On ne reverra sûrement pas Jericho
comme ça avant longtemps.
Il faut que j'y aille.
Quelle heure est-il ?
Un peu plus de minuit.
Tu dois vraiment partir ?
Oui, je ferais mieux d'y aller.

Previously on Jericho...
Jake Green.
How you doing, man?
- Wait a minute, where the hell you been?
- Around.
Jake, no one's been around for five years.
Seriously...
where have you been?
Hey, brother.
- What you put this family through...
- Johnston, for God's sake...
- Now, he could've been...
- You could spend a week talking
about what I could've been, all right?
- Stay one more day.
- I gotta get back to San Diego by tomorrow.
All right, looks like the explosion
came from the west, maybe Denver.
- Are we under attack?
- This could've be a test,
could've been an accident.
Hi, Dale.
Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel, but we...
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I am so sorry.
- I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
- She was in Atlanta.
Oh, my God!
- My mom died yesterday.
- I think my mom died yesterday, too.
Get April.
We'll meet you at the medical center.
There's an empty prison bus out there.
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident,
but if it was an attack, Sheriff...
...there's chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people knowing
that Jericho was still here.
Riley!
Is there anybody on this channel?
There are men here with guns.
I think they might have killed the sheriff.
Won't the rain clear
the radiation out of the air?
- Yes, and bring it straight down
on Jericho. - How do you know
about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?
Because I was a cop in St. Louis
and after 9-11, we got up to speed.
How long before the radiation gets here?
How long does it normally take a storm to
get here from Denver?
Less than two hours.
Everyone over here can go
to the town hall shelter.
All those on the north side
will go to the clinic.
Our shelter's no good.
I'm bringing these people to town hall.
They can't come in here, Jake.
- What do you mean they can't come in here?
- We're packed.
The salt mine, how many people will it hold?
We have to seal the entrance.
There's no door, Jake.
Well, we can't just let the rain
pour down the shaft.
These people won't be safe.
We're all clear.
- What's happening out there?
- I don't know.
You always know something.
You know, don't ask me questions.
She's still not talking.
I get that.
I mean, I'm a cop.
I've never killed anybody.
She'a schoolteacher.
Where's Stanley?
Jake, my brother doesn't know
about the radiation.
When the rain stops,
he'll be back, don't worry.
Bonnie, I know Stanley.
He'll be fine.
Jake, I got your brother.
- He's with your dad.
- Finally.
- Eric, how's Dad?
- He's good.
The town hall shelter is secure.
Listen, Jake, where are you?
I'm at the Richmond's.
As soon as the rain stops,
get every digging tool you can
find and get to the mine
I had to blow the entrance
to keep the rain out.
These people have been sealed
up way too long.
And I'm more worried the explosion
might have put some debris
into the ventilator.
Enough to slow it down?
Enough to shut it down.
We got to get them out.
We can't reach anyone at the mine.
We have no radio contact with anyone there.
Here, honey, take a little sip.
Okay, just a little. Pass it on.
Good, you guys, good.
Good, good, good.
One second.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
Hey.
- How you holding up?
- Oh, Heather.
I think our students
are taking it better than I am.
They just know there's
nothing to be afraid of.
For them, it's just like a bad field trip.
I'll be fine.
- Just having a hard time breathing.
- It's all right.
Here, take a little water.
Yeah.
Good.
I have to get outside.
Soon.
Soon.
- Is Mr. Rennie okay?
- He's gonna be fine.
We just need to give him
a little bit of room, okay?
Go on back.
I can't do this!
- Got to get outside!
- It's okay.
Deep breath, deep breath.
You doing all right?
Stupid question?
Right.
How do you know the rain's radioactive?
Denver's pretty far away.
Well, we don't know how many bombs
there were, we don't know...
What is it?
Someone's up in the house.
Not more prisoners?
- Stanley!
- Bonnie, thank God.
No! Hey, hey!
No! Uh-uh.
Stanley, don't touch her.
The rain may be radioactive.
April, Stanley seems to be okay.
I'd say he was in it for about 20 minutes.
Yeah, I was out at my cousin's
helping him put the livestock up
and got caught in it.
Is he vomiting?
No, he's not.
Okay, do you have any iodine there?
Bonnie, iodine?
Hey, what's with all the tanks?
What tanks?
On my way home, I passed a line of tanks.
They were hauling ass towards Denver.
Stanley, how many tanks did you see?
- Five, maybe.
- Where?
They were over the ridge.
I couldn't tell you
exactly where they were.
But I was on Pharr's Mill Road near I-70.
April, we have iodine.
He's going to need to take
a couple of tablespoons.
But it tastes vile,
so do you have any bread,
something that he could take with it?
We're in a cellar-- all we've got
is canned peaches and pickles.
Not the pickles.
Maybe the peaches.
Jake, just give me the iodine.
The second that the rain breaks,
rush him to the clinic.
And, Jake...
if he throws up in the next couple of hours
get Bonnie out of that room.
Why?
Because her brother's going to die.
- Just concentrate on breathing, please
- I can't.
Got to get out of here.
- I know. Soon.
- I got to get out of here!
Mr. Rennie, please, just concentrate
on your breathing.
Look at me.
Controlled.
Very...
- I got to get out of here.
- I know, Mr...
I got to get out of here!
I don't want to die down here!
Get me out of here!
- I don't want to be here!
- Look, everybody just calm down.
There's nothing to worry about.
- You're scaring the children, Scott.
- I can't breathe.
- He's claustrophobic.
- We got to get him out of here.
- Look, it's me.
- I'm sorry.
It's Shep. Try to focus, man
- try to focus.
- I got to get out of here!
- We got to get him away from these people.
- I got to get out of here!
I can't breathe!
- I don't want to die down here!
- Please be careful!
Please!
Stay back.
I don't want to die down here!
I don't...
Get me out of here!
- Jake wants to talk to you.
- His cough's getting much worse.
- I want you to make it brief.
- Okay, okay.
Yeah, son, what is it?
Dad, Stanley saw a line of tanks near I-70.
Well, you know,
there's a National Guard unit
to the southwest of there in Goodland.
Maybe they've got a relief effort going.
We need to get out there and see.
That could be a dangerous thing to do, son.
Can't just sit around and wait
to find out what's happening.
I'll go to Goodland.
Someone should check out Topeka.
Okay, son.
I'm going with you.
What?
I have to find Roger,
- and Goodland's on the way to Wichita.
- You're in no condition to...
I'm going.
With you or I'm going by myself.
For the last time,
you can't smoke here.
- waters for everyone.
- Thank you, honey.
- Johnston, I need to take
your temperature again.
- Oh, you just took it five minutes ago.
- Shh...
- Hasn't changed in five minutes.
- The mighty Johnston Green
felled by the flu. - Here it comes.
I don't know if I told you this
but my father is impervious to mere germs.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I believe that was the quote.
- First inauguration-- have it all on video.
- It was a joke.
I was trying to...
April, don't ever make a mistake.
This family will never let you forget it.
Okay, I'll remember that.
- Oh, come on.
- But still...
- Shh, Johnston.
I don't like him.
Me neither.
Here.
They're really stale.
You know, I keep thinking about
when we were kids
and how they used to make us practice
hiding under our desks
in case of an atomic bomb.
Yeah, duck and cover.
That's the first thing I thought of
when I saw that mushroom cloud.
Did they have enough time
to hide under their desks?
That's pretty stupid, huh?
No.
Eric?
I'm just a little confused.
Your wife isn't really acting like someone
- who knows the marriage has
been dead a long time.
- Mary...
Or did I get the wrong impression?
Mary, let's just get through this, okay?
Well, the next thing you're gonna tell me
is that she actually does understand you.
I'm sorry.
Jake, don't let Bonnie see your lips.
Listen, man.
If this thing doesn't turn out so good--
- the thing is,
Bonnie's still just a kid, so... - Stanley.
Don't even, all right?
- You're gonna be fine.
- I don't know.
My head is pounding and I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.
Eric, the rain has stopped.
What's this black stuff?
That used to be Denver.
- Bill, Emily, get Stanley
to the medical clinic now. - Okay.
Find April, she'll know what to do.
- Jimmy, you're coming with me to ne,
all right? - Jake.
- I meant what I said, all right?
- I know.
Look, I know, I know.
I will help you find Roger.
- I promise, okay?
Go, I'll meet you at the medical clinic.
Eric, we're coming to the mine now.
We have to dig those people out.
What was that?!
I think somebody's on the other side.
Get these people out of here.
All right, everyone,
you're gonna be okay.
All right, we have food and water.
And there are vehicles waiting for you guys
to take you to the clinic, all right?
Nice and slow.
File out, these guys'll help you.
Listen, you're okay.
Women and children first.
Please. Watch your step,
everyone, be careful.
It's gonna be okay.
- Are you okay?
- I think so.
Gray, what happened?
He's dead.
What?
Hey.
- Hey, how's Stanley?
- We're still watching him.
Where is he?
- We had to isolate him.
- Where? Where is he?
What the hell?
Do you like it?
It's where they make
the contagious kids wait
so they don't give everybody chicken pox.
- Did you throw up?
- Yeah, a couple times.
Apparently, that's what happens
when you drink a bottle of iodine.
I need to get back to the house.
I need to check on the livestock.
I need to check on the corn.
I need to get out of here.
- There's really nothing you
can do right now. - He's right.
- You need to stay.
- Yeah...
I'm really sick of being poked with
needles every ten minutes.
They'll be sorry when my
spider powers kick in.
Well, you're still an idiot,
so that's a good sign.
Yeah.
How bad is it?
Well, you're sleep deprived
like everyone else.
Bring the bandages to 102.
No, I mean the radiation.
Am I dying?
- Have you vomited?
- No. Should I?
- You just need some rest; go home.
- I'd like to.
When's the next flight to D.C?
Dr. Green?
Oh, there are a lot of people waiting.
- If you could just... - I just want
to know what happened to my friend.
Scott Rennie.
It looks like he had a heart attack.
I'm sorry.
But...
So what if I have three queens,
but I only have two jacks?
- I'm out.
- I so bluffed you.
- Skylar, are you still alive in there?
- Hey, what's up?
Sky, are you home?
- Hello?!
- Hey...
- Hey...
- Dude, I'm starving.
- What's up?
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing here?
This is not how it looks.
It sure looks how it looks.
Skylar, wait.
That guy's a weirdo.
I can't just sit around here all day.
We've got to find the sheriff and his men,
- we've got to get the power back on.
- Okay, now you're going to
stay here as long as it takes.
Now, don't make me take your pants with me.
- I can run this town without my pants.
- It wouldn't be the first time.
- Huh.
- All right.
That's a story I never want to hear.
Sweetheart.
How are you feeling, honey?
My leg's a little sore, but...
how's everything here?
- Your father has the flu.
- It's nothing.
Did you hear Mr. Rennie died?
It's terrible.
I've been thinking,
more than anything,
this town needs information.
We could organize a group of people.
Send them out in every direction.
- I don't think anyone should be
leaving Jericho. - We have to.
We can't just sit here in the dark.
He's right.
Makes us too vulnerable.
Abrams, you and Crossfield are taking
the northern route
up through Nebraska to the state police
barracks in Broken Bow.
Well, I can go east to Topeka
and connect with the state government.
Ridley can head west to Denver.
Well, what's left of it.
You'll probably run into a ring
of FEMA and EMS people
before you even get
within sight of the city.
See what they know.
What about you?
He's going to Wichita with me.
That's right, Emily and I are taking the
southern route to Wichita.
Well, let's try to radio
back as much information
as possible along the way.
That's the plan.
Hitting the major cities in each direction
north, south, east and west.
- The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
- Let's hope not.
Nope, we've still got static.
Try pointing it east.
We've got nothing,
keep moving it.
Nope, just static.
Just keep trying.
Mary.
Excuse me.
Mary.
Man.
Busy place.
Yeah, although the service
isn't what it used to be.
What'll you have?
Oh, my God.
We've got something!
- Where'd it go?
- Come on, bring it back!
We're losing the feed!
- Bring it back!
- Go back. We had something.
Was that Korean?
- Does anybody know?
- I think it was Chinese.
It was Mandarin.
The question is, were they just reporting it
or were they behind it?
Did Stanley say if there were any markings
- on the side of the tank?
- No.
- I mean, maybe we're being invaded.
- Abrams and Crossfield are out.
- They won't drive into a war zone.
- Yeah, well, I don't blame them.
Look, why don't we put this plan
on hold right now?
We saw one image;
we'll probably see another one.
Going out is more important
than ever, all right?
If this country is at war,
we need to know it.
Okay, we have Los Angeles,
Seattle and Philadelphia.
- What else did you see on the TV?
- I think Seattle's wrong.
- Okay. Uh, could it have been Portland?
- I don't think so.
Hey.
- I understand you lost some of your men?
- Yeah.
Need a volunteer, I'm available.
- Thanks, Mister...
- Hawkins.
Mr. Hawkins.
- Do you have a family?
- Two kids.
I think it's best if we stick to people
who don't have families.
Hey. Em?
Um, excuse me? Mr. Cale?
Something's been bothering me.
It's about Mr. Rennie's death.
The mine was full of people from the clinic.
How come nobody called for a doctor?
I don't want to talk about it.
I know you're upset.
But he was my friend, too.
I... I worked with him for three years.
Hey, Shep?
We're heading out for supplies.
Why don't you give us a hand?
You know, this whole thing
has been pretty hard on Shep.
He lost a good friend today.
We all did.
Emily?
Talk to me.
Was it the broadcast?
- Because we don't know
what any of it means.
- They got Wichita.
Roger is dead.
- We don't know that.
- I saw it on the map.
- Your fiancé might have made it.
- How?
What if his flight
got diverted to Des Moines?
Des Moines' gone.
Emily, what if it was Omaha, huh? Or Tulsa.
What if they set down in the middle of
a cornfield in Nebraska?
He could be anywhere.
Plane went down trying
to find a place to land.
- What if it exploded?
- Emily.
- What if he's dead?
- He's gone, and I'm here with you.
- Emily.
You were supposed to be the one
that was dead... not him.
Just leave me alone, Jake.
Go without me.
They took everything.
Oh, Dale.
Thank God.
I looked everywhere for you.
Are you all right?
I was so worried.
- I was safe.
- Good.
Gracie?
Oh, what now?
Gracie?
We're closed, Gail.
- I'm out of everything.
- That's why I'm here.
Some of the folks at the shelter brought
some stuff back,
and I thought you could use it.
It's one box.
I'm out of business.
My train shipment was supposed
to come through on Tuesday.
Without a delivery,
these shelves are gonna stay
as empty as they are right now.
I don't have a freezer anymore.
- Most of this stuff is going
to go bad any minute now.
- I know. Food's going bad all over town.
I need my shipment.
But we don't know if we'll ever
get the power back on.
Maybe we should cook it.
- What?
- Yeah. Everything, all of it.
As long as it's still good enough to eat.
Are you okay?
If you call radiation poisoning okay.
Were you out in the rain, too?
Oh, heavens, no.
I touched a building
when we came out of the shelter.
Oh.
Look, you can stop pretending.
What do you mean?
I audited your farm.
Why do you care?
Maybe I'm a nicer person than you.
Right.
Were you in the rain?
Yeah, for about 20 minutes.
- Well, you look pretty good.
- Thanks.
Try to work out.
Look, um... you know I think
I got the worst of it.
So as long as I'm okay,
you should be fine.
You're really sweet.
- And you still owe the IRS $180,000.
- Yeah, I know.
Every radio needs to be fully charged.
We'll stay in contact as long as we can.
Gray, the long-range ones are all charged.
- They're in the storage unit.
- All right, thanks.
Ridley, why don't you go
pack up the Geiger counters and the flares?
I'll meet you out there.
Gray, I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate what you're doing.
It's a gutsy move, and, uh,
- the whole town thanks you.
- Yeah, thanks.
What the hell happened out there?
I've known Scott Rennie his whole life.
He's strong as an ox.
I just...
I can't believe he's dead.
He was a good man.
- Heart attack at his age.
- Yeah, well, it wasn't a heart
attack that killed him.
- What do you mean?
- It was poor planning.
What are you talking about?
What I'm saying is that none of this
would have happened
if that clinic shelter had been maintained.
- You have a lot of people to answer to.
- All right, that's enough.
No, that's not nearly enough.
I get back here,
there's gonna be an investigation.
Hundreds of people could have died
'cause you dropped the ball.
- Why don't we talk about this in my office?
- You dropped the ball,
and it killed Scott Rennie.
In my office. Now.
Right now these people need our leadership.
I will not have you tearing this town apart.
And when all this is over,
if you and I are still alive,
you investigate your ass off.
In the meantime, if I hear any more
talk like that out of you,
you and I are gonna have a problem.
Do we understand each other?
- Where's Emily?
- She's not going.
Good.
- You're not going alone, are you?
- Yeah.
Don't give me that look.
- What look?
- You know what look. That look.
Hey, I told you 7,500 times
I have watched you drive away
not knowing if you were coming home.
I've earned a look.
I'm coming back.
Let's go!
Ridley?
Come on.
Shep?
Taking Ridley's place.
Going to Denver.
You don't have to do this.
What about your family?
I got to get out of here.
Shep, you'll get past this.
Yeah?
- Hey, Heather.
- Oh.
- Shep left this for you.
- Thanks.
"Dear Heather,
"I want you to know the truth
about Scott Rennie.
"It was my fault.
"Gray wanted me to keep him quiet,
"and his heart went out.
"I should have called
for a doctor, but I was scared.
"I let him die.
"I'll never forgive myself.
"You were a good friend to Scott.
"A better friend than I ever was.
Shep."
Well, they should be about
50 miles out by now.
Jake, are you still reading me? Jake?
I lost him.
Shep, are you there? Shep?
Eric, do me a favor.
I missed that last one, Shep.
Can you say it again?
Tell him I'm sorry.
Tell the family I'm sorry.
You're breaking up, Shep.
Hey, Gray, did you catch that?
No.
No, I didn't.
- I don't know, that would make
about 45 miles. - Right, so,
in about an hour...
- Jake, what are you doing back?
- You should be in Wichita by now.
- Smoky Hill Bridge is blocked.
- What is that?
It's a flight data recorder.
- I thought they were supposed to be black.
- Well, where'd you get it?
A couple of pilots used the highway
as a landing strip with mixed results.
- This is the only one I could get.
- Were there any survivors?
It was a commuter plane that didn't make it,
a 757 that was empty.
Well, where are they?
Where'd they go?
How do we listen to this?
- Do you have that old reel-to-reel
laying around? - Yeah.
Your father needs to hear this.
I'm going to go get him.
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm a little freaked.
Dad's here.
I've gone through most of this recording
from the plane that crashed.
This is the last 30 seconds or so.
A lot of background noise. You can hear...
pilots from planes in the area
talking to each other.
Wait.
The kids.
Oh, yeah. Come on, girls. Let's go.
Is anyone on this frequency?
There's no reply from ATCC!
Please advise. Ray-27 in emergency descend,
need coordinates for approach.
Give me full flaps; it's about to get bumpy.
This is Chinook 116 heavy.
Missed our handoff to Kansas City ATCC.
Does anyone read us? Over.
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6, reading you.
We're bingo fuel,
lost all VFR heading out of Chicago.
Tried all frequencies;
there's no one out there.
What does that mean?
They're out of gas and blind.
Guys, this is Primary 221.
I've got a mushroom cloud 16 kilometers
in height somewhere northwest over Denver.
I've got a visual on two separate plumes--
one over in Kansas City and one
south somewhere in Texas.
- Does anyone read ATC? - Negative.
There is no ATCC anymore, Chinook.
He's saying there's no traffic control.
There's 10,000 planes with no place to land.
That's about a million people in the air.
Whoa! Are those F-16s?
Right. Do you have a visual?
Affirm. Prime Missouri Guard.
131st out of Landburg.
These guys are hauling ass somewhere.
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
We found a stretch of highway long enough.
Follow us in. Setting down
On final approach, stand by.
Here we go.
Flaps, I need more flaps.
Losing it.
I can't hold it.
We're sliding here.
- Pull up! Pull up!
- I can't...!
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
We found a stretch of highway long enough.
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
We found a...
- Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
- Trans Shore...
We found a stretch of highway long...
Emily, come here.
- Roger was on Trans Shore 724, right?
- Yes.
Listen.
- This is primary...
- Jake, what is this?
- Just listen.
My co-pilot's blind. Background chatter.
- Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
- This is Trans Shore 724.
We've set down in a field,
GPS malfunctioned.
I think we're north of Kansas.
Minor injuries.
He's alive. He's alive.
Robert?
There's, uh, music outside.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the party.
Sounded like Sam Cooke from here, but, uh
there's a chance it could be Kenny Rogers.
Oh, Lord.
Robert, the kids would like to go.
- To the party?
- Yes.
We're not ready.
- Robert.
- No.
No.
Well, I'm glad there was
enough food for everyone.
I just wish someone would've said thank you.
Oh, it looks delicious.
Thanks.
She looks so much better.
You really made her happy.
- I owed her.
- Well, I'd say this makes you even.
Not even close.
You haven't said two words all night.
Just taking it all in.
It might be a long time before
we see Jericho like this again.
I got to go.
What time is it?
It's a little past midnight.
Do you really have to go?
Yeah, I should probably go.
Précédemment dans Jéricho...
Ok, il semblerait que l'explosion vienne de l'ouest
Peut-être de Denver.
On est attaqué ?
Ça pourrait être un essai.
Ça pourrait être un accident.
Ecoutez, je sais que vous dites aux gens que c'était un accident.
Mais si c'était une attaque, shérif !
Et c'est le chaos là-dehors.
Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises personnes sachent
que Jéricho est toujours là !
La mère de Dale Turner est morte ce soir, dans une autre explosion.
- Atlanta.
- Oh mon Dieu !
- La pluie ne fera pas partir les radiations de l'air ?
- Oui, et l'apportera directement sur Jéricho.
Une salve directe et concentrée.
N'importe qui exposé trop longtemps...
Comment savez-vous pour les radiations, M. Hawkins ?
Stanley.
Non, hey !  Non, uh-uh.
Stanley, ne la touche pas !
Comment sais-tu que la pluie est radioactive ?
Denver est plutôt loin...
Et bien, nous ne savons pas combien de bombes il y a eu.
Oh mon Dieu !
On a quelque chose !
Ils commentent seulement,
ou ils sont derrière tout ça ?
Peut-être une invasion.
Si ce pays est en guerre.
On a besoin de le savoir.
Plus que d'électricité ou de nourriture.
Cette ville a besoin d'informations.
- On ne peut pas rester ici dans l'ignorance.
- Il a raison.
Cela nous rend trop vulnérable.
On pourrait organiser des groupes de personnes.
Les envoyer dans toutes les directions.
- Les 4 cavaliers de l'apocalypse.
- Espérons que non.
Quatre jours après les bombes.
Je vous le dis, c'est le Midwest.
Depuis la ligne d'horizon, je pense à Cincinnati.
J'espérais que nous pourrions lire les plaques d'immatriculation.
Mettons sur Cincinnati un point d’interrogation.
- Jake.
- Salut, Stanley. Salut, Bonnie.
- Du nouveau ?
- Non, rien depuis hier.
Shep et Gray devraient déjà être de retour.
Nos radios sont devenues muettes à environ 80 kilomètres.
Mon Dieu, Je me demande bien ce qui
est arrivé à celui qui a filmé ça.
Je crois bien, que c'est la dernière chose qu'ils ont vue.
Le groupe électrogène commence à manquer de carburant.
Nous allons perdre la télé.
Je m'en occupe.
Comment tu feras ?
Les pompes de la station ne marchent plus.
Il n'y a plus de courant.
Je veux pas que tu t'inquiètes.
Désolée, messieurs dames !
Nous fermons de bonne heure ce soir !
Prenez des lampes de poche, il fait noir dehors.
Quoi ?  Il est à peine 9h30 !
Vous l'avez entendu, il faut partir.
C'est l'heure de rentrer.
Sortez.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Le générateur est HS ?
- Non, j'avais le blues.
- De nouvelles images ?
- Non, juste la même chose.
Viens, je te raccompagne.
Où habites-tu ?
Par là.
Alors, c'est pas trop bizarre d'être
à la maison après si longtemps ?
Un petit peu.
Je n'arrive toujours pas à me faire à l'idée
qu'il n'y ait plus de taureau mécanique au Bailey.
Stanley a dû pleurer quand on l'a enlevé.
il détient toujours le record.
Quand est-ce que le Pizza Garden est devenu un cyber café ?
Quand l'Hygiène a fermé le Pizza Garden.
Quoi ?!
Oh ne me dis pas que tu aimais le Pizza Garden ?
- J'y bossais, je faisais la plonge !
Oh, t'as pas dû y faire du très bon boulot.
Ca venait de la ruelle.
C'est la pharmacie.
Va chercher de l'aide.
Au secours...
Se... cours.
JERICHO
Saison 1 - Episode 4
" Walls of Jéricho "
By TJT
TED10 VOSTFR / mOOchie / shinjin / aSpro500
Jake.
C'est qui ?
Je ne sais pas.
Aide-moi à le sortir d'ici.
- Pas sans gants ou vêtement de protection.
- Nous devons l'amener voir un docteur, immédiatement !
Est-ce qu'il a été irradié ?
Je pense que ça se pourrait bien.
- Heather, Heather, fais la sortir !
- Okay, allez !
Allez Bill, on y va !
- Aide-nous à le porter !
- Je ne le touche pas. Pas moyen, pas moi.
Il pourrait être contagieux.
Il n'est pas contagieux, Bill.
Je suis désolé, Stanley.
Et si c'était moi étendu ici, Bill ?
Tu ferais pareil ?
Nous pourrions tomber malade en touchant ce type !
Ce n'est pas comme avec toi, Stanley.
Nous ne savons même pas qui est ce type !
Je me suis juste arrêté au Bailey's
pour vérifier le signal de la télé.
- Tu peux pas être un peu plus cool avec ton mari ?
- Et ça t'a pris trois heures ?
- J'ai dû y rester à peine une heure !
- Nous sommes en état d'urgence, Eric.
Je suis au courant, April.
Le Dr Peterson est allé à Kansas City pour voir sa fille.
- Et le Dr Hoder a travaillé ces dernières 24 heures.
- Bien, je suis ici maintenant !
- Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
- Et toi... tu décides de boire une bière !
J'ai un bébé sous ventilateur.
Et le groupe électrogène est quasiment en panne sèche.
Tu n'as pas une pompe à main ?
Et qui va pomper ?
Poussez-vous !
Poussez-vous !
Poussez-vous !
- April, il a des problèmes de respiration.
- Mets-le en Salle 3
Qui est-ce ?
Qui est là ?
Hé ho ?
Qui est là ?
- C'est juste moi, Mme Leigh.
- Oh, Dale.
Mais que....
- Tu m'as flanqué une frousse bleue !
- C'était censé être une surprise.
Quoi ?
Oh...
Où as-tu trouvé tout ça ?
Le train qui n'ai jamais arrivé.
Il s'est écrasé contre une voiture.
Il y a une tonne de nourriture à l'intérieur.
C'est juste à environ 8 Kms à l'extérieur de la ville.
Et bien, nous ne pouvons pas simplement nous servir,
ça ne nous appartient pas. Pas tout, en tout cas.
Toute la ville a pris votre nourriture.
Et bien, c'était une urgence.
Et ça aussi !
On s'en fout.
Qui est cet homme ?
Quelqu'un l'a reconnu ?
Pas encore.
Ces brûlures...
- Cela signifie-t-il qu'il était proche de l'explosion ?
- Pourquoi est-il venu à Jéricho ?
- Ca fait une sacrée route depuis Denver.
- Peut-être qu'il connaît quelqu'un en ville .
Alors pourquoi cambriolait-il une pharmacie ?
- Une pièce d'identité ?
- Non, juste des clés. Il n'a même pas de portefeuille.
- Il va s'en sortir ?
- Ca dépend de la dose qu'il a reçue.
Fils, toi et Stanley devriez aller vous laver.
Ces vêtements pourraient encore être contaminés.
Il y a une douche au bout du couloir.
Papa.
Nous avons un autre problème.
Il n'y a plus beaucoup de carburant dans le groupe.
Le Bailey était dans le noir ce soir.
C'était la seule parabole en ville
qui capté quelque chose.
Notre seul lien avec le monde extérieur.
- Ca va ?
- Ouais.
Nous allons demander aux gens de
siphonner le carburant de leurs voitures.
Et s'il nous en faut davantage ?
Il n'y a pas assez de carburant pour la clinique.
- Tu me dis que nous devons en renvoyer ?
- Non, je dis que nous avons des ressources limitées.
Et bien, pour le moment, trouvons
autant de carburant que nous le pouvons.
Certaines infirmières sont anxieuses.
Elles sont inquiètes à cause des contaminations.
Chéri, je ferai tout ce que je pourrai pour t'aider.
Si tu pouvais garder un oeil sur ce bébé.
Alors je pourrai voir les autres patients.
Bien sûr.
Je prie dieu pour que le courant reste.
On va faire tout ce que l'on peut, jusqu'au bout.
Papa, c'est Sam.
Papa, j'ai soif, tu es là ?
- Des messages de Shep ou de Gray?
- Non, Monsieur le Maire.
On ne peut toujours pas les joindre à la radio.
Peut-être qu'ils ont été capturés pas
les types des chars que Stanley a vus.
Ces chars sont probablement ceux de la garde nationale.
- D'accord, alors...
- Tu n'en sais rien.
- Ils peuvent être...
- Chut.
C'est peut-être les Chinois,
C'est peut-être les Iraniens.
Al-Qaida, les Nord-Coréens.
N'importe qui, détestant les USA.
Ils viennent peut-être par ici,
et c'est quoi notre ligne de défense ?
Il faut y réfléchir.
Jake ?
Ho.
Je devais prendre une douche.
- Vas y.
- Non, ça y est... je me suis juste rincé.
Ho, d'accord.
Alors quoi de neuf ?
Je...
April a dit que le groupe de la clinique allait être à court de carburant,
Et elle m'a envoyé voir si on pouvait siphonner le carburant de nos véhicules.
Et alors, j'ai pensé à tout ce carburant
dans le réservoir de la station de Murphy,
et si nous pouvions trouver un moyen de le pomper,
on pourrait avoir tout le carburant dont on a besoin.
Une pompe à eau pourrait elle faire l'affaire ?
Bonnie.
Ca pourrait être mon frère.
- C'est comme ça qu'il va mourir ?
- Non. Stanley ne vas pas aussi mal.
- Il pourrait avoir un cancer.
- Non, on n'en sait rien.
Ecoute.
Ne t'inquiète pas pour moi, ça va aller.
Prenez soin de lui.
Je vais devoir le mettre sous respirateur,
ça pompe du jus, mais..
Mais le bébé a de meilleurs chances
de survie, garde ça pour lui.
Hey, hey, hey, et lui ?
- On lui donne quelque chose pour la douleur, pour qu'il ne souffre pas.
- On reste là à le regarder mourir ?
J'aime pas ça non plus, Jake, mais c'est
la meilleure solution que l'on a pour le moment.
A moins que tu ne trouves mieux.
- Le générateur va tenir jusqu'à demain matin ?
- Je pense que oui.
D'accord, donnez-moi jusque là.
Vous pouvez me dire votre nom ?
Victor.
Miller.
Victor.
Victor, Vous êtes dans une clinique.
- D'accord, on va prendre soin de vous.
- Non, non.
Ils arrivent.
Ils arrivent.
- www.seriessub.com -
Il va rester inconscient combien de temps, selon toi ?
Ca pourrait être long.
Si il se réveille un jour.
C'est qui "Ils" ?
Qui arrive ?
Ben, peut être qu'il a vu les passagers d'un de ces avions.
Il aurait pu mentionner des terroristes.
Tant qu'il ne se réveille pas,
on ne peut pas savoir quels dangers se préparent.
Pour le moment, enrôlez autant de suppléants que vous le pourrez
pour qu'ils vous aident à trouver de l'essence.
La clinique va être a court.
Ce n'est pas mon carburant, il appartient à Noraco.
Il ne sert à personne, M. Murthy. Et sans électricité,
les pompes ne peuvent même pas marcher.
- Et on vous donnera un reçu pour les deux milles litres.
- Je pourrais être viré.
Avec tout les respect que je vous dois,
qui va pouvoir vous virer ?
C'est un monde différent maintenant, M. Murthy.
D'accord, allons l'ouvrir.
Stanley sera là d'ici une minute.
Ils ne vont jamais revenir.
Les chefs de secteur, aucun d'entre eux.
Pas vrai ?
Non.
Quelques temps après la mort de ma mère,
mon mari a été transféré vers St louis.
Ce fut dur de quitter Memphis, parce que c'était notre maison.
Mais avec le temps, on s'y est fait.
Comment ta mère est morte ?
M.S.
Aly,
De quel endroit de St Louis on vient ?
- Kirkwood.
- qui se trouve ?
Près de Powder Valley.
Plein de balades dans la nature.
Nous adorons les balades.
- Sam, ou allais tu à l'école ?
- A l'école "Crow".
L'école "Crow Island".
Mon dieu, on revu ça tellement de fois.
Et on le refera, encore et encore, tant que ce ne sera pas parfait.
Mam'...
Tu sais quoi, je ne peux plus continuer comme ça.
tu peux garder Samuel ici, j'ai mon histoire à moi.
On vivait dans un deux pièces, on avait une Volvo verte,
on devait rester à la maison parce que maman travaillait tout
le temps, et que notre père n'était jamais là.
Monte. Vas y.
- Vous avez une minute ?
- Bien sûr.
Vous devez sûrement savoir que notre
shérif a été tué, avec trois autres de nos hommes.
Je l'ai appris.
Je suis désolé pour vos morts.
Merci.
Il ne reste plus que Bill et moi, et aucun de nous
deux n'a été entraîné pour des alertes nationales.
Je crois que personne n'y est préparé.
On a besoin de quelques adjoints de plus.
- Et j'ai pensé que comme vous avez
été flic à St. Louis et tout ça...
- Non.
C'est une offre flatteuse mais je veux
rester près de ma famille.
C'est juste le temps que...
Ecoutez, M. Hawkins, les gens deviennent fous.
D'accord, on a des vitrines brisées,
et les gamins se servent.
On a besoin d'hommes forts pour montrer à la population,
que la loi est toujours présente dans cette ville.
D'accord.
Je commence quand ?
Vous avez déjà commencé.
On demande à tout le monde en ville,
de nous donner 10 litres d'essence.
Désolé, mon chou.
J'ai besoin de ma voiture.
Mais, Gracie, si la clinique n'a plus de carburant,
des gens peuvent mourir.
Je compatis, Eric, mais j'ai déjà donné à
cette ville tout le stock de mon magasin.
Trouve quelqu'un d'autre.
Bill.
<i>Du nouveau ?</i>
Je retourne à la clinique, avec ce que j'ai.
Comment ça se passe de ton côté ?
<i>Ca se présente pas bien.
Il manque toujours 500 litres pour la clinique.</i>
<i>Les gens ont peur, Eric.
Ils font des stocks.</i>
Peut être qu'on devrait pas être si patient.
J'ai pas trouvé de cuve à pesticides vides.
Je pense que cette citerne d'eau fera l'affaire.
Non, non, on nr peut pas utiliser d'acier,
il y a trop de risques d'énergie statique.
Une seule étincelle, et tous s'embrase !
On n'a pas le temps de trouver autre chose.
Bon..bon, Qui va le faire ?
- Quoi, que veux-tu faire ?
- Non, je le fais, et toi tu t'occupes de Bonnie.
Joue pas les héros.
J'ai déjà été irradié, moi.
- Je suis déjà condamné.
- Non, rappelle toi, tu vas vivre 100 ans.
- Notre pacte est rompu.
- Arrêtez de discuter, et faites le.
Descends du camion, Stanley.
Descends de là.
Recule.
Salut, Allison.
On dirait un zoo aujourd'hui.
- Heu, ça fait 2 dollars.
- Voilà.
- T'as eu le dernier paquet de chips.
- Je t'en donne 20 dollars.
- Elle l'a pris en premier.
- Bon, je te donne les 20 €, à toi.
Ou plutôt, j'organise une fête.
Si tu me donne les chips, je t'invite.
- Je te connais même pas.
- Et alors ?
C'est pas comme si il y avait des
tas d'autres trucs à faire.
T'es un ange, tu viens quand tu veux.
C'est la grande maison, au dessus des pins.
D'accord, Bon ben, merci je suppose.
Bonjour.
Oh, mon Dieu...
Le générateur s'est arrêté !
Que quelqu'un appelle April... vite.
Tout s'est arrêté.
- Il ne respire plus.
- Bon, il faut que j'aille voir le bébé,
et je n'ai qu'une seule pompe à main.
Tu as été infirmière, Gail.
Tu t'en sortiras.
Allons-y.
Gardez un rythme régulier.
Euh, les mecs, on a un problème.
C'est coincé.
Non, non...
Attends, Attends, Attends.
Attends, attends, attends, attends !
Calme-toi.
- Je vais le desserrer.
- Non. L'essence a été secouée là-dedans,
doit y avoir plein de vapeur.
- Si tu forces sur le bouchon et qu'il y a une étincelle...
- Tu veux faire quoi, hein ?
Ecoute, avec toute l'électricité statique emmagasinée,
ça pourrait tout faire péter.
C'était très con.
Bon, tiens, donne-lui ça.
Allez !
Toujours pas de pouls.
Allez !
C'est bon, ça arrive.
Vas-y, Stanley.
Comment va-t-il?
- Son coeur s'est arrêté pendant 2 minutes.
- Aidez-moi pour le moniteur.
Tu vois l'interrupteur noir ?
Tu peux l'allumer ?
Oh, c'est vrai.
Je t'ai invitée.
- Oh, ouais, mais, tu sais je ne... j'ai pas...
- Non, t'inquiète. Entre.
Salut, où est April ?
Allez.
Allez.
April...
J'ai pu récupérer 300 litres d'essence.
Pour le générateur.
Merci.
On s'est débrouillé.
Sky, regarde qui s'incruste.
Pose juste ça par là.
Pourquoi t'es aussi débile quand t'es avec tes amis ?
- J'interromps une querelle d'amoureux ?
- Arrête, Lisa.
Tu sais quoi ?
J'vais rentrer chez moi.
Je suis juste venue parce que tu m'as supplié.
Rentre... chez toi.
Victor !
Victor. Tout va bien.
April !
April !
Vic...
Victor, vous disiez qu'ils venaient.
Qui vient ?
Ils ont besoin... d'aide.
Mais qui ?
Qui a besoin d'aide ?
20 personnes... de Denver.
Où sont-ils, hein ?
Où sont-ils ?
- Le lac...
- Un lac ?
- Bateau. Ponton.
- Un lac avec un ponton ?
Un lac avec un ponton.
Sur quelle route, vous vous souvenez ?
Je...
avec ma... fille.
- ...viennent...
- April !
Je peux vous aider ?
Hé, baissez un peu.
- Ouais, on a reçu une plainte, vous utilisez trop d'énergie.
- Et ?
- Et... la fête est finie.
- Vous n'avez pas le droit.
- C'est une propriété privée.
- C'est vrai. Tout le monde s'en va.
- Combien d'essence vous utilisez pour faire tourner tout ça, Skylar ?
- Ça ne vous regarde pas.
C'est mon générateur, et c'est mon essence.
Très bien.
Hé, hé, hé, hé.
Rentre à la maison.
<i>Jimmy. Jimmy !</i>
<i>Tu devrais venir voir ici.
On a trouvé le camion de Shep.</i>
Bill ?
Aucune trace de Shep,
mais regardez ce que j'ai trouvé à l'intérieur.
On dirait que Victor Miller a perdu son portefeuille.
C'est l'homme dont vous me parliez ?
Le... L'étranger, à l'hôpital ?
Ouais. Vous le reconnaissez ?
Non.
Je pense qu'on pourrait lui demander ce qu'il
fabriquait avec votre ami Shep.
April, il faut qu'on parle à Victor Miller.
- Il est inconscient.
- Je pense qu'il faut que tu le réveilles.
Non.
Toujours la même chose.
Regarde ces gens courir.
Et s'ils venaient ici ?
Salut.
Tu as fait un miracle.
Le générateur est rempli, on peut tenir encore 3 jours.
Super, 3 jours.
Hé.
Tout va bien se passer.
Tu sais, quand tu dis ça, je te croirais presque.
<i>Eric, t'es là ?</i>
Vas-y, Jimmy.
<i>On a trouvé le camion de Shep.</i>
<i>Rejoins-nous à la clinique.</i>
J'arrive.
Peu importe.
On doit rechercher sa famille.
Pourquoi il était dans le camion de Shep ?
On doit savoir ce qu'il faisait avec lui.
- Je sais, mais on peut pas torturer un mourant.
- Personne ne torture quiconque.
On pourrait lui donner une dose d'adrénaline.
- Ça le réveillera suffisamment pour qu'on l'interroge.
- Il souffre de brûlures au 3ème degré.
Ça serait comme le réveiller sur un brasier.
Euh...
Pleins de gens meurent dehors.
Shep est peut-être déjà mort.
- On doit veiller à notre protection, Jake.
- On doit se protéger de ça.
Jake, Shep, c'est l'un des nôtres.
- On doit découvrir ce que ce gars lui a fait.
- Hé, il va mourir de toute façon.
Mais il peut encore sauver quelques vies.
Eric.
- Je voudrais le faire moi-même.
- Non, je le quitterai pas.
D'accord.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il se passe là-dedans ?
- Ils lui posent quelques questions.
- C'est hors de question. C'est mon patient.
- Laissez-moi passer.
- On a besoin de renseignements.
Vous n'avez pas le droit.
- C'est peut-être un meurtrier.
- Et ça vous donne le droit de faire tout ce que vous voulez ?
Oui.
Oui.
Victor, Tout va bien se passer.
On va faire vite, d'accord ?
Hé.
La voiture que vous conduisiez...
quelqu'un vous l'a prêtée ?
Non, non.
Elle était...
Elle était... sur le bord...
de la route.
- D'accord.
- Elle... Elle... était en route.
D'accord, très bien.
- Il y avait quelqu'un dedans ?
- Non.
J'ai dû... les aider.
Où sont-ils ?
- Vous vous souvenez de quelque chose à propos de ce lac ?
- Il est en flammes.
- C'était près d'un chemin en terre ?
- Il brûle.
- Il a besoin de morphine.
- Votre fille, elle était à Bass Lake ?
- Ou... Oui. - Il a besoin de morphine, Jake.
- S'il vous plaît, s'il vous plaît.
On n'avait pas dit seulement les familles, mmm ?
- Pourquoi... Pourquoi es-tu retourné à Denver ?
- Je...
- Je ne pouvais pas les laisser mourir.
- C'était une erreur, Vic.
- Maintenant on a des hommes à terre.
- Non. Quelqu'un... Quelqu'...
Qu... quelqu'un... quelqu'un a pêté un plomb.
Un traître.
Il y a... un trai... traître parmi nous.
Sais-tu de qui il s'agit ?
Allez, mec, dis le moi.
- Vic, C'était qui ?
- Je...
Dis-le moi.
Sais-tu qui c'est ?
Tu... sais.
Il est parti.
Il fallait le faire.
Je pensais que tu allais à une fête, chérie.
Tu en vaut dix comme elle.
- Dix comme qui ?
- Skylar Stevens.
- Elle n'est pas si mauvaise.
- Mmm.
Nous ne sommes pas comme eux.
Ils peuvent être gentils parfois, mais...
...il ne faut pas se laisser avoir.
C'est ce que maman disait toujours.
Et bien, c'était une dame futée.
Tu as peur ?
Ça me rappelle, quand j'avais fait quelque chose de mal,
et que j'attendais que mon père rentre à la maison.
Mon bébé, ce que tu as fait aujourd'hui...
ce n'était pas qu'aller à une fête.
Parce que, tu as mis ta mère,
ton frère,
et nous tous en danger.
Tu m'entends ?
Et si jamais tu recommences, ma fille,
tu n'as pas idée de la peur que tu ressentiras.
J'ai besoin de quelques volontaires.
Il y a un groupe de personnes
juste en dehors de la ville.
Pas question, mec ! C'est trop dangereux là dehors !
Ils sont à Bass Lake.
Ils ont peut-être été irradiés. Il faut que nous les ramenions ici,
pour les faire examiner à la clinique avant qu'il ne soir trop tard.
- Rallume !
- On l'a assez vu.
On l'a vu plus de 100 fois.
Un homme vient de mourir dans notre clinique.
Notre clinique !
Il voyageait avec sa fille
et une vingtaine d'autres personnes.
Ca aurait très bien pu être Shep...
ou Gray.... ou l'un de nous.
Ils ont besoin de notre aide.
Allons-nous les aider ?
Ou allons-nous rester là à regarder en boucle
ces trois images, encore et encore.
Jake ?
Je peux vous fournir de l'essence si vous avez besoin
de votre voiture pour aller les chercher.
- Merci, Mary.
- Je vous accompagne.
Merci.
Personne d'autre ?
- Je t'accompagne aussi, Jake. Je viens.
-Allons-y.
- Oui, moi aussi.
- Merci.
Tôt ce matin, nous avons enterré 20 personnes...
Des réfugiés de Denver.
Des gens que nous ne connaissions pas...
Mais que nous étions prêts à accueillir
dans notre ville.
Malheureusement ils sont morts suite aux radiations,
avant que nous ne puissions les rejoindre.
Pour ces gens de Denver,
et pour notre propre groupe,
pour le Shérif Dawes et l'Adjoint Riley...
pour l'adjoint Conner et l'adjoint Salem...
...pour des gens d'un peu partout
que nous ne connaissons pas,
qui sont peut-être en train de souffrir
et de mourir en ce moment même...
Je demande une minute de silence.
Si vous avez perdu un proche,
levez-vous, s'il vous plaît.
Si quelqu'un que vous aimez a disparu,
voulez-vous bien rejoindre ceux qui sont debout ?
Nous sommes debout car nous savons
que chaque vie compte.
Il faut se battre pour chaque vie,
même si ça semble désespéré,
même si nous avons peur,
car la bataille qui nous attend n'est pas seulement
pour notre propre survie,
mais pour celle de toute l'humanité.
Je pense que ça va aller.
Jake. Salut.
Tu es un homme bien pour essayer d'aider
quelqu'un que tu ne connais même pas.
- Hé, tu as encore soif ?
- Non. Je n'arrive pas à dormir.
- Où as-tu été à l'école, Sam?
- Crow Island.
- Qui est ton père ?
- Toi.
- Qui t'aime plus que tout au monde ?
- Toi.
Et, Sam,
- Qui va toujours prendre soin de toi ?
- Maman.
- www.seriessub.com -
Précédemment dans Jéricho...
Ok, il semblerait que l'explosion vienne de l'ouest
Peut-être de Denver.
On est attaqué ?
Ça pourrait être un essai.
Ça pourrait être un accident.
Ecoutez, je sais que vous dites aux gens que c'était un accident.
Mais si c'était une attaque, shérif !
Et c'est le chaos là-dehors.
Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises personnes sachent
que Jéricho est toujours là !
La mère de Dale Turner est morte ce soir, dans une autre explosion.
- Atlanta.
- Oh mon Dieu !
- La pluie ne fera pas partir les radiations de l'air ?
- Oui, et l'apportera directement sur Jéricho.
Une salve directe et concentrée.
N'importe qui exposé trop longtemps...
Comment savez-vous pour les radiations, M. Hawkins ?
Stanley.
Non, hey !  Non, uh-uh.
Stanley, ne la touche pas !
Comment sais-tu que la pluie est radioactive ?
Denver est plutôt loin...
Et bien, nous ne savons pas combien de bombes il y a eu.
Oh mon Dieu !
On a quelque chose !
Ils commentent seulement,
ou ils sont derrière tout ça ?
Peut-être une invasion.
Si ce pays est en guerre.
On a besoin de le savoir.
Plus que d'électricité ou de nourriture.
Cette ville a besoin d'informations.
- On ne peut pas rester ici dans l'ignorance.
- Il a raison.
Cela nous rend trop vulnérable.
On pourrait organiser des groupes de personnes.
Les envoyer dans toutes les directions.
- Les 4 cavaliers de l'apocalypse.
- Espérons que non.
Quatre jours après les bombes.
Je vous le dis, c'est le Midwest.
Depuis la ligne d'horizon, je pense à Cincinnati.
J'espérais que nous pourrions lire les plaques d'immatriculation.
Mettons sur Cincinnati un point d’interrogation.
- Jake.
- Salut, Stanley. Salut, Bonnie.
- Du nouveau ?
- Non, rien depuis hier.
Shep et Gray devraient déjà être de retour.
Nos radios sont devenues muettes à environ 80 kilomètres.
Mon Dieu, Je me demande bien ce qui
est arrivé à celui qui a filmé ça.
Je crois bien, que c'est la dernière chose qu'ils ont vue.
Le groupe électrogène commence à manquer de carburant.
Nous allons perdre la télé.
Je m'en occupe.
Comment tu feras ?
Les pompes de la station ne marchent plus.
Il n'y a plus de courant.
Je veux pas que tu t'inquiètes.
Désolée, messieurs dames !
Nous fermons de bonne heure ce soir !
Prenez des lampes de poche, il fait noir dehors.
Quoi ?  Il est à peine 9h30 !
Vous l'avez entendu, il faut partir.
C'est l'heure de rentrer.
Sortez.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Le générateur est HS ?
- Non, j'avais le blues.
- De nouvelles images ?
- Non, juste la même chose.
Viens, je te raccompagne.
Où habites-tu ?
Par là.
Alors, c'est pas trop bizarre d'être
à la maison après si longtemps ?
Un petit peu.
Je n'arrive toujours pas à me faire à l'idée
qu'il n'y ait plus de taureau mécanique au Bailey.
Stanley a dû pleurer quand on l'a enlevé.
il détient toujours le record.
Quand est-ce que le Pizza Garden est devenu un cyber café ?
Quand l'Hygiène a fermé le Pizza Garden.
Quoi ?!
Oh ne me dis pas que tu aimais le Pizza Garden ?
- J'y bossais, je faisais la plonge !
Oh, t'as pas dû y faire du très bon boulot.
Ca venait de la ruelle.
C'est la pharmacie.
Va chercher de l'aide.
Au secours...
Se... cours.

Saison 1 - Episode 4
" Walls of Jéricho "
By TJT
TED10 VOSTFR / mOOchie / shinjin / aSpro500
Jake.
C'est qui ?
Je ne sais pas.
Aide-moi à le sortir d'ici.
- Pas sans gants ou vêtement de protection.
- Nous devons l'amener voir un docteur, immédiatement !
Est-ce qu'il a été irradié ?
Je pense que ça se pourrait bien.
- Heather, Heather, fais la sortir !
- Okay, allez !
Allez Bill, on y va !
- Aide-nous à le porter !
- Je ne le touche pas. Pas moyen, pas moi.
Il pourrait être contagieux.
Il n'est pas contagieux, Bill.
Je suis désolé, Stanley.
Et si c'était moi étendu ici, Bill ?
Tu ferais pareil ?
Nous pourrions tomber malade en touchant ce type !
Ce n'est pas comme avec toi, Stanley.
Nous ne savons même pas qui est ce type !
Je me suis juste arrêté au Bailey's
pour vérifier le signal de la télé.
- Tu peux pas être un peu plus cool avec ton mari ?
- Et ça t'a pris trois heures ?
- J'ai dû y rester à peine une heure !
- Nous sommes en état d'urgence, Eric.
Je suis au courant, April.
Le Dr Peterson est allé à Kansas City pour voir sa fille.
- Et le Dr Hoder a travaillé ces dernières 24 heures.
- Bien, je suis ici maintenant !
- Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
- Et toi... tu décides de boire une bière !
J'ai un bébé sous ventilateur.
Et le groupe électrogène est quasiment en panne sèche.
Tu n'as pas une pompe à main ?
Et qui va pomper ?
Poussez-vous !
Poussez-vous !
Poussez-vous !
- April, il a des problèmes de respiration.
- Mets-le en Salle 3
Qui est-ce ?
Qui est là ?
Hé ho ?
Qui est là ?
- C'est juste moi, Mme Leigh.
- Oh, Dale.
Mais que....
- Tu m'as flanqué une frousse bleue !
- C'était censé être une surprise.
Quoi ?
Oh...
Où as-tu trouvé tout ça ?
Le train qui n'ai jamais arrivé.
Il s'est écrasé contre une voiture.
Il y a une tonne de nourriture à l'intérieur.
C'est juste à environ 8 Kms à l'extérieur de la ville.
Et bien, nous ne pouvons pas simplement nous servir,
ça ne nous appartient pas. Pas tout, en tout cas.
Toute la ville a pris votre nourriture.
Et bien, c'était une urgence.
Et ça aussi !
On s'en fout.
Qui est cet homme ?
Quelqu'un l'a reconnu ?
Pas encore.
Ces brûlures...
- Cela signifie-t-il qu'il était proche de l'explosion ?
- Pourquoi est-il venu à Jéricho ?
- Ca fait une sacrée route depuis Denver.
- Peut-être qu'il connaît quelqu'un en ville .
Alors pourquoi cambriolait-il une pharmacie ?
- Une pièce d'identité ?
- Non, juste des clés. Il n'a même pas de portefeuille.
- Il va s'en sortir ?
- Ca dépend de la dose qu'il a reçue.
Fils, toi et Stanley devriez aller vous laver.
Ces vêtements pourraient encore être contaminés.
Il y a une douche au bout du couloir.
Papa.
Nous avons un autre problème.
Il n'y a plus beaucoup de carburant dans le groupe.
Le Bailey était dans le noir ce soir.
C'était la seule parabole en ville
qui capté quelque chose.
Notre seul lien avec le monde extérieur.
- Ca va ?
- Ouais.
Nous allons demander aux gens de
siphonner le carburant de leurs voitures.
Et s'il nous en faut davantage ?
Il n'y a pas assez de carburant pour la clinique.
- Tu me dis que nous devons en renvoyer ?
- Non, je dis que nous avons des ressources limitées.
Et bien, pour le moment, trouvons
autant de carburant que nous le pouvons.
Certaines infirmières sont anxieuses.
Elles sont inquiètes à cause des contaminations.
Chéri, je ferai tout ce que je pourrai pour t'aider.
Si tu pouvais garder un oeil sur ce bébé.
Alors je pourrai voir les autres patients.
Bien sûr.
Je prie dieu pour que le courant reste.
On va faire tout ce que l'on peut, jusqu'au bout.
Papa, c'est Sam.
Papa, j'ai soif, tu es là ?
- Des messages de Shep ou de Gray?
- Non, Monsieur le Maire.
On ne peut toujours pas les joindre à la radio.
Peut-être qu'ils ont été capturés pas
les types des chars que Stanley a vus.
Ces chars sont probablement ceux de la garde nationale.
- D'accord, alors...
- Tu n'en sais rien.
- Ils peuvent être...
- Chut.
C'est peut-être les Chinois,
C'est peut-être les Iraniens.
Al-Qaida, les Nord-Coréens.
N'importe qui, détestant les USA.
Ils viennent peut-être par ici,
et c'est quoi notre ligne de défense ?
Il faut y réfléchir.
Jake ?
Ho.
Je devais prendre une douche.
- Vas y.
- Non, ça y est... je me suis juste rincé.
Ho, d'accord.
Alors quoi de neuf ?
Je...
April a dit que le groupe de la clinique allait être à court de carburant,
Et elle m'a envoyé voir si on pouvait siphonner le carburant de nos véhicules.
Et alors, j'ai pensé à tout ce carburant
dans le réservoir de la station de Murphy,
et si nous pouvions trouver un moyen de le pomper,
on pourrait avoir tout le carburant dont on a besoin.
Une pompe à eau pourrait elle faire l'affaire ?
Bonnie.
Ca pourrait être mon frère.
- C'est comme ça qu'il va mourir ?
- Non. Stanley ne vas pas aussi mal.
- Il pourrait avoir un cancer.
- Non, on n'en sait rien.
Ecoute.
Ne t'inquiète pas pour moi, ça va aller.
Prenez soin de lui.
Je vais devoir le mettre sous respirateur,
ça pompe du jus, mais..
Mais le bébé a de meilleurs chances
de survie, garde ça pour lui.
Hey, hey, hey, et lui ?
- On lui donne quelque chose pour la douleur, pour qu'il ne souffre pas.
- On reste là à le regarder mourir ?
J'aime pas ça non plus, Jake, mais c'est
la meilleure solution que l'on a pour le moment.
A moins que tu ne trouves mieux.
- Le générateur va tenir jusqu'à demain matin ?
- Je pense que oui.
D'accord, donnez-moi jusque là.
Vous pouvez me dire votre nom ?
Victor.
Miller.
Victor.
Victor, Vous êtes dans une clinique.
- D'accord, on va prendre soin de vous.
- Non, non.
Ils arrivent.
Ils arrivent.
- www.seriessub.com -
Il va rester inconscient combien de temps, selon toi ?
Ca pourrait être long.
Si il se réveille un jour.
C'est qui "Ils" ?
Qui arrive ?
Ben, peut être qu'il a vu les passagers d'un de ces avions.
Il aurait pu mentionner des terroristes.
Tant qu'il ne se réveille pas,
on ne peut pas savoir quels dangers se préparent.
Pour le moment, enrôlez autant de suppléants que vous le pourrez
pour qu'ils vous aident à trouver de l'essence.
La clinique va être a court.
Ce n'est pas mon carburant, il appartient à Noraco.
Il ne sert à personne, M. Murthy. Et sans électricité,
les pompes ne peuvent même pas marcher.
- Et on vous donnera un reçu pour les deux milles litres.
- Je pourrais être viré.
Avec tout les respect que je vous dois,
qui va pouvoir vous virer ?
C'est un monde différent maintenant, M. Murthy.
D'accord, allons l'ouvrir.
Stanley sera là d'ici une minute.
Ils ne vont jamais revenir.
Les chefs de secteur, aucun d'entre eux.
Pas vrai ?
Non.
Quelques temps après la mort de ma mère,
mon mari a été transféré vers St louis.
Ce fut dur de quitter Memphis, parce que c'était notre maison.
Mais avec le temps, on s'y est fait.
Comment ta mère est morte ?
M.S.
Aly,
De quel endroit de St Louis on vient ?
- Kirkwood.
- qui se trouve ?
Près de Powder Valley.
Plein de balades dans la nature.
Nous adorons les balades.
- Sam, ou allais tu à l'école ?
- A l'école "Crow".
L'école "Crow Island".
Mon dieu, on revu ça tellement de fois.
Et on le refera, encore et encore, tant que ce ne sera pas parfait.
Mam'...
Tu sais quoi, je ne peux plus continuer comme ça.
tu peux garder Samuel ici, j'ai mon histoire à moi.
On vivait dans un deux pièces, on avait une Volvo verte,
on devait rester à la maison parce que maman travaillait tout
le temps, et que notre père n'était jamais là.
Monte. Vas y.
- Vous avez une minute ?
- Bien sûr.
Vous devez sûrement savoir que notre
shérif a été tué, avec trois autres de nos hommes.
Je l'ai appris.
Je suis désolé pour vos morts.
Merci.
Il ne reste plus que Bill et moi, et aucun de nous
deux n'a été entraîné pour des alertes nationales.
Je crois que personne n'y est préparé.
On a besoin de quelques adjoints de plus.
- Et j'ai pensé que comme vous avez
été flic à St. Louis et tout ça...
- Non.
C'est une offre flatteuse mais je veux
rester près de ma famille.
C'est juste le temps que...
Ecoutez, M. Hawkins, les gens deviennent fous.
D'accord, on a des vitrines brisées,
et les gamins se servent.
On a besoin d'hommes forts pour montrer à la population,
que la loi est toujours présente dans cette ville.
D'accord.
Je commence quand ?
Vous avez déjà commencé.
On demande à tout le monde en ville,
de nous donner 10 litres d'essence.
Désolé, mon chou.
J'ai besoin de ma voiture.
Mais, Gracie, si la clinique n'a plus de carburant,
des gens peuvent mourir.
Je compatis, Eric, mais j'ai déjà donné à
cette ville tout le stock de mon magasin.
Trouve quelqu'un d'autre.
Bill.
<i>Du nouveau ?</i>
Je retourne à la clinique, avec ce que j'ai.
Comment ça se passe de ton côté ?
<i>Ca se présente pas bien.
Il manque toujours 500 litres pour la clinique.</i>
<i>Les gens ont peur, Eric.
Ils font des stocks.</i>
Peut être qu'on devrait pas être si patient.
J'ai pas trouvé de cuve à pesticides vides.
Je pense que cette citerne d'eau fera l'affaire.
Non, non, on nr peut pas utiliser d'acier,
il y a trop de risques d'énergie statique.
Une seule étincelle, et tous s'embrase !
On n'a pas le temps de trouver autre chose.
Bon..bon, Qui va le faire ?
- Quoi, que veux-tu faire ?
- Non, je le fais, et toi tu t'occupes de Bonnie.
Joue pas les héros.
J'ai déjà été irradié, moi.
- Je suis déjà condamné.
- Non, rappelle toi, tu vas vivre 100 ans.
- Notre pacte est rompu.
- Arrêtez de discuter, et faites le.
Descends du camion, Stanley.
Descends de là.
Recule.
Salut, Allison.
On dirait un zoo aujourd'hui.
- Heu, ça fait 2 dollars.
- Voilà.
- T'as eu le dernier paquet de chips.
- Je t'en donne 20 dollars.
- Elle l'a pris en premier.
- Bon, je te donne les 20 €, à toi.
Ou plutôt, j'organise une fête.
Si tu me donne les chips, je t'invite.
- Je te connais même pas.
- Et alors ?
C'est pas comme si il y avait des
tas d'autres trucs à faire.
T'es un ange, tu viens quand tu veux.
C'est la grande maison, au dessus des pins.
D'accord, Bon ben, merci je suppose.
Bonjour.
Oh, mon Dieu...
Le générateur s'est arrêté !
Que quelqu'un appelle April... vite.
Tout s'est arrêté.
- Il ne respire plus.
- Bon, il faut que j'aille voir le bébé,
et je n'ai qu'une seule pompe à main.
Tu as été infirmière, Gail.
Tu t'en sortiras.
Allons-y.
Gardez un rythme régulier.
Euh, les mecs, on a un problème.
C'est coincé.
Non, non...
Attends, Attends, Attends.
Attends, attends, attends, attends !
Calme-toi.
- Je vais le desserrer.
- Non. L'essence a été secouée là-dedans,
doit y avoir plein de vapeur.
- Si tu forces sur le bouchon et qu'il y a une étincelle...
- Tu veux faire quoi, hein ?
Ecoute, avec toute l'électricité statique emmagasinée,
ça pourrait tout faire péter.
C'était très con.
Bon, tiens, donne-lui ça.
Allez !
Toujours pas de pouls.
Allez !
C'est bon, ça arrive.
Vas-y, Stanley.
Comment va-t-il?
- Son coeur s'est arrêté pendant 2 minutes.
- Aidez-moi pour le moniteur.
Tu vois l'interrupteur noir ?
Tu peux l'allumer ?
Oh, c'est vrai.
Je t'ai invitée.
- Oh, ouais, mais, tu sais je ne... j'ai pas...
- Non, t'inquiète. Entre.
Salut, où est April ?
Allez.
Allez.
April...
J'ai pu récupérer 300 litres d'essence.
Pour le générateur.
Merci.
On s'est débrouillé.
Sky, regarde qui s'incruste.
Pose juste ça par là.
Pourquoi t'es aussi débile quand t'es avec tes amis ?
- J'interromps une querelle d'amoureux ?
- Arrête, Lisa.
Tu sais quoi ?
J'vais rentrer chez moi.
Je suis juste venue parce que tu m'as supplié.
Rentre... chez toi.
Victor !
Victor. Tout va bien.
April !
April !
Vic...
Victor, vous disiez qu'ils venaient.
Qui vient ?
Ils ont besoin... d'aide.
Mais qui ?
Qui a besoin d'aide ?
20 personnes... de Denver.
Où sont-ils, hein ?
Où sont-ils ?
- Le lac...
- Un lac ?
- Bateau. Ponton.
- Un lac avec un ponton ?
Un lac avec un ponton.
Sur quelle route, vous vous souvenez ?
Je...
avec ma... fille.
- ...viennent...
- April !
Je peux vous aider ?
Hé, baissez un peu.
- Ouais, on a reçu une plainte, vous utilisez trop d'énergie.
- Et ?
- Et... la fête est finie.
- Vous n'avez pas le droit.
- C'est une propriété privée.
- C'est vrai. Tout le monde s'en va.
- Combien d'essence vous utilisez pour faire tourner tout ça, Skylar ?
- Ça ne vous regarde pas.
C'est mon générateur, et c'est mon essence.
Très bien.
Hé, hé, hé, hé.
Rentre à la maison.
<i>Jimmy. Jimmy !</i>
<i>Tu devrais venir voir ici.
On a trouvé le camion de Shep.</i>
Bill ?
Aucune trace de Shep,
mais regardez ce que j'ai trouvé à l'intérieur.
On dirait que Victor Miller a perdu son portefeuille.
C'est l'homme dont vous me parliez ?
Le... L'étranger, à l'hôpital ?
Ouais. Vous le reconnaissez ?
Non.
Je pense qu'on pourrait lui demander ce qu'il
fabriquait avec votre ami Shep.
April, il faut qu'on parle à Victor Miller.
- Il est inconscient.
- Je pense qu'il faut que tu le réveilles.
Non.
Toujours la même chose.
Regarde ces gens courir.
Et s'ils venaient ici ?
Salut.
Tu as fait un miracle.
Le générateur est rempli, on peut tenir encore 3 jours.
Super, 3 jours.
Hé.
Tout va bien se passer.
Tu sais, quand tu dis ça, je te croirais presque.
<i>Eric, t'es là ?</i>
Vas-y, Jimmy.
<i>On a trouvé le camion de Shep.</i>
<i>Rejoins-nous à la clinique.</i>
J'arrive.
Peu importe.
On doit rechercher sa famille.
Pourquoi il était dans le camion de Shep ?
On doit savoir ce qu'il faisait avec lui.
- Je sais, mais on peut pas torturer un mourant.
- Personne ne torture quiconque.
On pourrait lui donner une dose d'adrénaline.
- Ça le réveillera suffisamment pour qu'on l'interroge.
- Il souffre de brûlures au 3ème degré.
Ça serait comme le réveiller sur un brasier.
Euh...
Pleins de gens meurent dehors.
Shep est peut-être déjà mort.
- On doit veiller à notre protection, Jake.
- On doit se protéger de ça.
Jake, Shep, c'est l'un des nôtres.
- On doit découvrir ce que ce gars lui a fait.
- Hé, il va mourir de toute façon.
Mais il peut encore sauver quelques vies.
Eric.
- Je voudrais le faire moi-même.
- Non, je le quitterai pas.
D'accord.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il se passe là-dedans ?
- Ils lui posent quelques questions.
- C'est hors de question. C'est mon patient.
- Laissez-moi passer.
- On a besoin de renseignements.
Vous n'avez pas le droit.
- C'est peut-être un meurtrier.
- Et ça vous donne le droit de faire tout ce que vous voulez ?
Oui.
Oui.
Victor, Tout va bien se passer.
On va faire vite, d'accord ?
Hé.
La voiture que vous conduisiez...
quelqu'un vous l'a prêtée ?
Non, non.
Elle était...
Elle était... sur le bord...
de la route.
- D'accord.
- Elle... Elle... était en route.
D'accord, très bien.
- Il y avait quelqu'un dedans ?
- Non.
J'ai dû... les aider.
Où sont-ils ?
- Vous vous souvenez de quelque chose à propos de ce lac ?
- Il est en flammes.
- C'était près d'un chemin en terre ?
- Il brûle.
- Il a besoin de morphine.
- Votre fille, elle était à Bass Lake ?
- Ou... Oui. - Il a besoin de morphine, Jake.
- S'il vous plaît, s'il vous plaît.
On n'avait pas dit seulement les familles, mmm ?
- Pourquoi... Pourquoi es-tu retourné à Denver ?
- Je...
- Je ne pouvais pas les laisser mourir.
- C'était une erreur, Vic.
- Maintenant on a des hommes à terre.
- Non. Quelqu'un... Quelqu'...
Qu... quelqu'un... quelqu'un a pêté un plomb.
Un traître.
Il y a... un trai... traître parmi nous.
Sais-tu de qui il s'agit ?
Allez, mec, dis le moi.
- Vic, C'était qui ?
- Je...
Dis-le moi.
Sais-tu qui c'est ?
Tu... sais.
Il est parti.
Il fallait le faire.
Je pensais que tu allais à une fête, chérie.
Tu en vaut dix comme elle.
- Dix comme qui ?
- Skylar Stevens.
- Elle n'est pas si mauvaise.
- Mmm.
Nous ne sommes pas comme eux.
Ils peuvent être gentils parfois, mais...
...il ne faut pas se laisser avoir.
C'est ce que maman disait toujours.
Et bien, c'était une dame futée.
Tu as peur ?
Ça me rappelle, quand j'avais fait quelque chose de mal,
et que j'attendais que mon père rentre à la maison.
Mon bébé, ce que tu as fait aujourd'hui...
ce n'était pas qu'aller à une fête.
Parce que, tu as mis ta mère,
ton frère,
et nous tous en danger.
Tu m'entends ?
Et si jamais tu recommences, ma fille,
tu n'as pas idée de la peur que tu ressentiras.
J'ai besoin de quelques volontaires.
Il y a un groupe de personnes
juste en dehors de la ville.
Pas question, mec ! C'est trop dangereux là dehors !
Ils sont à Bass Lake.
Ils ont peut-être été irradiés. Il faut que nous les ramenions ici,
pour les faire examiner à la clinique avant qu'il ne soir trop tard.
- Rallume !
- On l'a assez vu.
On l'a vu plus de 100 fois.
Un homme vient de mourir dans notre clinique.
Notre clinique !
Il voyageait avec sa fille
et une vingtaine d'autres personnes.
Ca aurait très bien pu être Shep...
ou Gray.... ou l'un de nous.
Ils ont besoin de notre aide.
Allons-nous les aider ?
Ou allons-nous rester là à regarder en boucle
ces trois images, encore et encore.
Jake ?
Je peux vous fournir de l'essence si vous avez besoin
de votre voiture pour aller les chercher.
- Merci, Mary.
- Je vous accompagne.
Merci.
Personne d'autre ?
- Je t'accompagne aussi, Jake. Je viens.
-Allons-y.
- Oui, moi aussi.
- Merci.
Tôt ce matin, nous avons enterré 20 personnes...
Des réfugiés de Denver.
Des gens que nous ne connaissions pas...
Mais que nous étions prêts à accueillir
dans notre ville.
Malheureusement ils sont morts suite aux radiations,
avant que nous ne puissions les rejoindre.
Pour ces gens de Denver,
et pour notre propre groupe,
pour le Shérif Dawes et l'Adjoint Riley...
pour l'adjoint Conner et l'adjoint Salem...
...pour des gens d'un peu partout
que nous ne connaissons pas,
qui sont peut-être en train de souffrir
et de mourir en ce moment même...
Je demande une minute de silence.
Si vous avez perdu un proche,
levez-vous, s'il vous plaît.
Si quelqu'un que vous aimez a disparu,
voulez-vous bien rejoindre ceux qui sont debout ?
Nous sommes debout car nous savons
que chaque vie compte.
Il faut se battre pour chaque vie,
même si ça semble désespéré,
même si nous avons peur,
car la bataille qui nous attend n'est pas seulement
pour notre propre survie,
mais pour celle de toute l'humanité.
Je pense que ça va aller.
Jake. Salut.
Tu es un homme bien pour essayer d'aider
quelqu'un que tu ne connais même pas.
- Hé, tu as encore soif ?
- Non. Je n'arrive pas à dormir.
- Où as-tu été à l'école, Sam?
- Crow Island.
- Qui est ton père ?
- Toi.
- Qui t'aime plus que tout au monde ?
- Toi.
Et, Sam,
- Qui va toujours prendre soin de toi ?
- Maman.

Previously on Jericho:
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west
maybe Denver.
Are we under attack?
This could've been a test.
Could've been an accident.
Look, I know you're telling
people it was an accident
but if it was an attack, Sheriff
and there's chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people knowing
that Jericho is still here.
Dale Turner's mother died tonight
in another explosion
--Atlanta.
--Oh, my God.
--Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?
--Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho.
A direct, concentrated hit.
Anyone exposed too long...
How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?
Stanley.
No, hey! No, uh-uh.
Stanley, don't touch her.
How do you know the rain's radioactive?
Denver's pretty far away.
Well, we don't know
how many bombs there were.
Oh, my God.
We got something!
Are they just reporting it
or are they behind it?
Maybe we're being invaded.
If this country is at war,
we need to know it.
More than electricity or food,
this town needs information.
--We can't just sit here in the dark.
--He's right.
Makes us too vulnerable.
We could organize a group of people
send them out in every direction
--The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
--Let's hope not.
I'm telling you, it's the Midwest.
From the skyline, I'm thinking Cincinnati.
I wish we could read the license plates.
Let's make Cincinnati a question mark.
--Jake.
--Hey, Stanley. Hey, Bonnie.
--Anything new?
--No, not since yesterday.
Shep and Gray should have been back by now.
Our radios went silent about 50 miles out.
God, it makes you wonder
what happened to whoever shot this.
I think that might have been
the last thing they ever saw.
The generator's running out of gas.
We're going to lose the TV.
I'll take care of it.
How can you?
Gas pumps don't work at the station
with the power down.
Look, I don't want you to worry.
Sorry, folks.
We're closing early tonight.
Take a flashlight,
it's dark out there.
What? It's only 9:30.
You heard her,
let's move it, folks.
Time to go home.
Let's move it out.
--Hey.
--Hey.
--Is the generator out?
--No, out of booze.
--Any more images?
--No, just the same loop.
Come on, I'll walk you home.
Where do you live?
That way.
So is it weird being home after so long?
A little bit.
I still can't get used to Bailey's
without the mechanical bull.
Stanley must have cried
when they took that out.
He had the record.
When did the Pizza Garden
become the Cyberjolt Cafe?
Oh, when the Health Department
shut down the Pizza Garden.
What?!
--Oh, don't tell me you liked the Pizza Garden.
--I used to work there washing dishes.
Oh, you must not have done a very good job.
That came from the alley.
It's the pharmacy.
Why don't you go get some help?
Help...
H... Help.
Jake.
Who is he?
I don't know. Help me get him out of here.
Not without gloves or a hazmat suit.
We got to get him to a doctor, now.
Is that radiation sickness?
I think it might be.
--Heather, Heather.
Get her out.
--Okay. Let's go.
Come on, Bill, let's go.
--Help us pick him up.
--I'm not touching him.
No way. Not me.
He could be contagious.
He's not contagious, Bill.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
What if it was me lying here, Bill?
Would you walk away then?
We could get sick touching that guy.
It's not like with you, Stanley.
We don't even know who this guy is.
I just stopped by Bailey's
to check on the TV signal.
--Can't you cut your husband some slack?
--And that took three hours?
--I was only there for, like, an hour.
--We're in a state of emergency, Eric.
I'm aware of that, April.
Dr. Peterson's gone to Kansas City
to look for his daughter.
--And Dr. Hoder's worked the last 24 hours.
--Well, I am here now.
--What do you want from me?
--And you... decided to go have a beer.
I've got a baby on a ventilator
and the generator is almost out of gas.
Well, don't you have a hand pump?
Who'd pump it?
Out of the way.
Out of the way.
Out of the way!
--April, he's having trouble breathing.
--Get him in Room Three.
Who is that?
Who's in there?
Hello?
Who is that?
--It's just me, Mrs. Leigh.
--Oh, Dale.
What are you up to?
--You scared me to death.
--It was supposed to be a surprise.
What?
Oh...
Where did you get all this?
The train that never showed up.
It smashed into a car.
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.
It's just about five miles outside of town.
Well, we can't just take it, it's not ours.
Not all of it, anyway.
The town took your food.
Well, it was an emergency.
And so is this.
The hell with them.
Who is this man?
Anyone recognize him?
Not so far.
Those burns...
--Does that mean that he was close to the blast?
--Why'd he come to Jericho?
--It's a hell of a way from Denver.
--Maybe he's related to someone in town.
Then why'd he break into the pharmacy?
--Any I.D.?
--No, just some keys.
He doesn't even have a wallet.
--Is he going to be okay?
--Depends on the dose that he got.
Son, you and Stanley should go wash up.
--Those clothes might still be contaminated.
--There's a shower down the hall.
Dad.
We got another situation.
There's not much more gas
in the generator here.
Bailey's tavern went dark tonight.
That was the only satellite dish
in town getting a signal
our only link to the outside world.
--You okay?
--Yeah.
We're going to have to get people to siphon
gas out of their cars.
What if more come?
There's not enough gas to keep the clinics
going for all of them.
--You saying we ought to turn them away?
--No, I'm saying we have limited resources.
Well, for right now, let's just get
as much as we can.
Some of the nurses are spooked.
They're worried about contamination.
Honey, I'll do anything I can to help you.
If you could, keep an eye on this baby
then I could see to the other patients.
Sure.
I hope to God the power doesn't go.
Look, we'll do everything we can
until we can't.
Dad, it's Sam.
Dad, I'm thirsty, are you in there?
--Any word from Shep or Gray?
--No, Mayor.
Still can't get 'em on the radio.
Maybe they got captured by
those tanks Stanley saw.
Those tanks are probably just National Guard
--okay? So--
--You don't know that.
--They could be--
--Shh.
They could be China,
they could be Iran.
Al Qaeda, North Korea--
anybody who hates us.
They could be coming here and what's
our line of defense?
You're looking at it.
Jake?
Oh.
Had to take a shower.
--Go ahead.
--No, I I did; I just took a shower.
Oh, right.
So what's up?
I...
April said that the medical
center was running low
on gasoline for the generator
and it occurred to me that
if we had a length of hose
and a funnel, we could siphon
gas out of our cars.
Then it occurred to me there's all that gas
in the tanks at Murthy's gas station
and if we could get enough suction we could
get all the gas we wanted...
Would a water pump do it?
Bonnie.
This could be my brother.
--Is this how they die?
--No. Stanley didn't get it this bad.
--He could still got cancer.
--No, we don't know that.
Listen.
Don't worry about me,
I'll be fine.
Take care of him.
I'm going to have to put him on a ventilator
it'll use up power but--
But the baby has the better chance for survival
--save the generator for the baby.
--Hey, hey, hey, what about him?
Give him something for the pain.
--Keep him comfortable.
--Sit back and watch him die.
Well, I don't like it, Jake,
but that's the most rational
option we have right now.
Unless you can think of something better.
--Will your generator last until morning?
--I think so.
All right, give me until then.
Can you tell me your name?
Victor.
Miller.
Victor.
Victor, you're in a medical clinic.
--Okay, we're going to take care of you.
--No, no.
They're coming.
They're coming.
So how long do you think he'll be unconscious?
Could be a long time.
If he ever wakes up again.
Who are "they"?
Who's coming?
Well, maybe he saw passengers
from one of those planes.
He could've meant terrorists.
Unless he wakes up,
we don't know what kind of danger we're in.
For right now,
hire as many deputies as you can
use them to help you get gas.
Clinic's running low.
But it's not my gas,
it belongs to Noraco.
It's no use to anyone, Mr. Murthy.
Without electricity, the pumps don't even work.
--And we'll leave you an I.O.U. for the 500 gallons.
--I could be fired.
With all due respect, who's going to fire you?
It's a different world now, Mr. Murthy.
All right, let's get them open.
Stanley will be here any second.
They're never coming back.
The district manager, any of them.
Are they?
No.
Shortly after my mother died,
my husband was transferred to St. Louis.
It was hard to leave Memphis,
because it was our home.
But eventually we learned to love it.
How did your mother die?
M.S.
Aly,
what area of St. Louis are we from?
--Kirkwood.
--Which is where?
--Near Powder Valley.
Lots of hiking, trails and nature.
We love to hike.
--Sam, where'd you go to school?
--The Crow School.
Crow Island School.
God, we've gone over this so many times.
And we'll go over it again and again
until we get it right.
Mom...
You know what, I can't keep doing this.
Keep Samuel inside.
I've got my story.
Hey.
We lived in a two-bedroom house
we drove a green Volvo,
we had a stay-at-home mom, which is bull
because she worked all the time
because our dad was never around.
Upstairs. Go on.
--You got a minute?
--Of course.
You probably heard the, uh,
Sheriff's been killed, along with
three more of our men.
I heard.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Well, we're down to just me and Bill, and
neither of us is trained for
a national emergency.
I don't think anyone is prepared for this.
We need a few more deputies.
--And I thought since you were a cop in
St. Louis and all...
--No.
It's a very flattering offer, but I'm still
settling my family.
It'd just be for the time being.
Look, Mr. Hawkins, people are on edge.
All right, we've got break-ins
and kids vandalizing.
We just need some more manpower to show people
there's still law and order in this town.
All right.
When do I start?
You're already on the clock.
We're asking everyone in town to donate
five gallons of gas.
Sorry, honey.
I need my car.
But, Gracie, if the clinic
goes down, people could die.
I sympathize, Eric,
but I already gave this town my whole store.
Someone else can donate gas.
Bill.
What's up?
I'm going to head to the clinic
with what I've got.
How are things on your end?
It's not looking good.
We're still 90 gallons short at the clinic.
People are scared, Eric.
They're hoarding.
Maybe we can't afford to be so polite.
I couldn't find an empty pesticide container.
--I thought this water tank might do.
--No, no, we can't use steel.
There's too much risk of static.
One spark, the whole thing could blow sky-high.
We don't have time to look for something else.
Well-well, who's going to fill it?
--Well, what do you want to do, draw straws?
--No, I'll do it, you got Bonnie to take care of.
Don't be a martyr.
I've already been irradiated.
--I'm doomed.
--No, you're going to live to be 100, remember?
--Our pacts never work out.
--Let's just do this before we
think about it too much.
Get off the truck, Stanley.
Get off the truck.
Back up.
Hey, Allison.
This place has been a zoo all day.
--Uh, that's $1.69.
--Okay.
--You got the last bag of corn chips.
--I'll give you 20 bucks for them.
--She picked them up first.
--Fine, I'll give you the 20.
Or how about this?
I'm having a party.
If you give me the chips, then I'll invite you.
--I don't even know you.
--So?
It's not like there's anything else to do.
You're awesome.
Come by anytime, it's the big house
at the top of the Pines.
Okay, well, thanks, I guess.
Hi.
Oh, God...
The generator's down!
Somebody call April. Hurry.
We've lost all his machines.
--He's not breathing.
--Okay, I've got to get to the baby
and I only have one hand pump.
You used to be a nurse, Gail.
You'll do fine.
Let's go.
Keep a steady pace.
Uh, guys, we have a problem.
It's stuck.
No, no... Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!
Don't feel bad.
--I'll loosen it up for you.
--No. The gas has been sloshing around in there
building up fumes.
--If you force the cap, and it sparks...
--What do you want to do, huh?
Look, with all the static electricity built up
we could blow the thing to kingdom come.
That was dumb.
All right, here, get that to him.
Let's go!
I can't get a heartbeat.
Let's go!
All right, got it.
Go, Stanley.
How's he doing?
--He was down for about two minutes.
--I need help with the cardiac feed.
See that black switch?
Can you turn that on?
Oh, right.
I invited you.
--Oh, yeah, but, you know I don't...
I don't have to...
--No, forget it. Come in.
Hey, where's April?
Come on.
Come on.
April...
I got 75 gallons of gas.
For the generator.
Thanks.
We got it covered.
Sky, look who invited himself.
Just put it over there.
Why are you such a jerk when
you're with your friends?
--Did I interrupt a lover's spat?
--Stop it, Lisa.
You know what?
I'm gonna go home.
I only came here 'cause you begged me to.
Just... go home.
Victor!
Victor. It's okay.
April!
April!
Vic...
Victor, you said they're coming.
Who's coming?
They need... help.
Who does?
Who needs help?
20 from... Denver.
Where are they, huh?
Where are they?
Lake... A lake?
--Boat. Boat dock.
--A lake with a boat dock?
A lake with a boat dock.
What road is it on, do you remember?
I...
have my... daughter.
--...coming...
--April!
Can I help you?
Hey, turn that down.
--Yeah, we had a complaint that
you're using too much power.
--And?
--And... the party's over.
--You can't do this.
--This is a private home.
--All right, everybody pack it up.
--How much gas you using to run this place, Skylar?
--None of your business.
It's my generator, it's my gas.
Right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Just go home.
Jimmy. Jimmy!
You got to get over here.
We found Shep's truck.
Bill?
No sign of Shep,
but look what I found inside.
Looks like Victor Miller forgot his wallet.
This is the man you were talking about?
The... The stranger in the hospital?
Yeah. You recognize him?
No.
I just think we should ask him what
he did with your friend Shep.
April, we need to talk to Victor Miller.
--He's unconscious.
--I think you need to wake him up.
No.
Still the same stuff.
Look at all the people running.
What if they come here?
Hey.
You worked a miracle.
Generator's full; we can go three more days.
Great, three days.
Hey.
Everything's going to be all right.
You know, when you say it, I almost believe it.
Eric, you there?
Go, Jimmy.
We found Shep's truck.
Meet us at the clinic.
I'm on my way.
It doesn't matter.
We have got to go look for his family.
Why'd he have Shep's truck?
We need to know what he did with him.
--I know, but we can't just torture a dying man.
--No one is torturing anyone.
We could give him a shot of adrenaline.
--It'll wake him up enough to question him.
--He's dying of third degree burns.
--It'll be like waking him up on fire.
--Uh...
Our people are dying out there.
Shep may already be dead.
--We need to protect ourselves, Jake.
--We need to protect ourselves from this.
Jake, Shep, he's one of us.
--We need to find out what this guy did to him.
--Hey, he is going to die, anyway.
But he could save some people's lives.
Eric.
--I'd like to do this myself.
--No, I'm not leaving him.
Okay.
What's going on in there?
--They're asking him a few questions.
--Like hell they will. That's my patient.
--Let go of me.
--We need information.
You have no right.
--He could be a murderer.
--And that gives you the power
to do anything that you want?
Yes.
Yes.
Victor, it's going to be okay.
We'll make this quick, all right?
Hey.
The car you drove here--
did someone give it to you?
No, no.
It was...
It was... on the side...
of the road.
Okay. It... It was... running.
Okay, okay.
--But was there anybody in it?
--No.
I had... to help them.
Where are they?
--Do you remember anything else about the lake?
--It burns.
--Was it off a dirt road?
--It burns.
--He needs morphine.
--Was your daughter at Bass Lake?
--Y-Yes.
--He needs morphine, Jake.
--Please, please.
Hey. Hey!
We said families only, hmm?
--Why? Why did you go back to Denver?
--I...
--I couldn't let them die.
--It was a mistake, Vic,
--because now we are a man down.
--No. Some... some...
S-Someone... Someone flipped.
A traitor.
There's...a tra... traitor.
Do you know who it was?
Come on, man, tell me.
--Vic, who was it?
--I...
Tell me.
Do you know who it was?
You... know.
He's gone.
We had to do it.
I thought you were going to a party, hon.
You're worth ten of her.
--Ten of who?
--Skylar Stevens.
--She's not a bad person.
--Hmm.
We're not like them.
They can be nice sometimes, but
don't be fooled.
That's what my mom used to say.
Well, she was a smart lady.
You scared?
'Cause I remember when I did something wrong
waiting for my old man to come home.
Baby, what you did today--
that wasn't just you going to a party.
It wasn't.
You put your mother,
your brother,
all of us at risk.
Do you hear?
And if you pull something like this again
girl, you have no idea how scared you'll be.
I need a few volunteers.
There's a group of people just outside of town.
No way, man! It's too dangerous out there!
They're at Bass Lake.
They may have radiation sickness.
We need to bring them here
get them to the clinic
before it's too late.
--Turn it back on!
--We've seen it.
We've seen it 100 times.
A man just died in our clinic. Our clinic!
He was traveling with his daughter
and about 20 other people.
All right, it could have been
Shep or Gray or any of us.
They need our help.
Are we going to help them?
Or are we just going to sit here watching
the same three images over and over?
Jake?
I'll donate gas if you need
to fill your car to get them.
--Thank you, Mary.
--I'll go with you.
Thank you.
Anybody else?
--I'll go with you, Jake. I'll go.
--Let's go.
--Yeah, me, too.
--Thank you.
Earlier today, we buried 20 people--
refugees from Denver.
People we didn't know,
but were prepared to welcome into our town.
Unfortunately, they died of radiation poisoning
before we could reach them.
For those people from Denver,
and for our own people,
for Sheriff Dawes and Deputy Riley
for Deputy Conner and Deputy Salem...
...for people out there
somewhere we know nothing about
who might be suffering and dying right now--
I ask that we take a moment of silence.
If you've lost a loved one,
would you please stand?
If someone you love is missing,
would you join those standing?
We stand because we know
that every life matters.
We have to fight for every life,
even when it seems hopeless,
even when we're afraid,
because the battle ahead
isn't just for our survival
it's for our humanity.
I think I'm going to be okay.
Jake. Hi.
You're a good man for trying
to help someone you didn't even know.
--Hey, you thirsty again?
--No. Couldn't sleep.
--Where did you go to school, Sam?
--Crow Island.
--Who is your dad?
--You.
--Who loves you more than anything in the world?
--You.
And, Sam,
--who is always going to take care of you?
--Mommy.

Précédemment dans Jericho...
<i>On dirait que l'explosion venait de l'ouest,
peut-être de Denver.</i>
<i>Ça pouvait être un essai, ou un accident.</i>
<i>Mais si c'était une attaque, c'est le chaos dehors,</i>
<i>Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises
personnes sachent que Jericho est toujours là !</i>
<i>La mauvaise nouvelle, c'est qu'il y a eu
une autre explosion à Atlanta.</i>
<i>Ho, mon Dieu, on a quelque chose !</i>
<i>Ils rapportent la nouvelle, ou ils ont derrière tout ça ?</i>
<i>Recrute autant d'adjoints que tu peux.</i>
<i>Aide-les à trouver de l'essence.</i>
<i>La clinique va bientôt être à court.</i>
<i>J'ai pas pu trouver de container à pesticide vide.</i>
<i>Je pense que ce réservoir d'eau fera l'affaire.</i>
<i>Non, non, non, il faut pas d'acier.</i>
<i>Trop de risque d'électricité statique.</i>
<i>L'essence a été secouée là-dedans.</i>
<i>Un étincelle, et tout va nous péter à la figure.</i>
<i>On n'a pas le temps de chercher autre chose.</i>
<i>Aidez-moi.</i>
<i>C'est un réfugié de Denver.</i>
<i>Vous le reconnaissez ?</i>
<i>Non.</i>
<i>On a besoin de renseignements.</i>
<i>Où sont-ils ?</i>
<i>Un lac en flamme.</i>
<i>Il lui faut de la morphine.</i>
<i>Pourquoi êtes-vous retourné à Denver ?</i>
<i>Je ne pouvais pas les laisser mourir.</i>
<i>C'était une erreur, Vic,</i>
<i>maintenant, il nous manque un homme.</i>
<i>Il est mort.</i>
J'en ai marre de la guerre.
Personne ne gagne réellement.
Moi aussi.
Je pense qu'on peut jouer au 8 Américain en attendant.
Ou à la Dame de Pique ?
J'arrête pour cette nuit.
Comme tu veux,
mais ça fait des heures qu'il ne fait plus nuit.
Vous voulez tous du café ?
Un Irish pour moi.
Alors, Mimi, qu'est-ce que tu ferais
si tu retournais à Washington ?
Dormir.
Vous savez ce qu'il y a de pire ici pour dormir ?
- Quoi ?
- Le Calme.
Je ne sais pas comment vous supportez ça.
C'est comme si j'avais une chambre d'écho dans ma tête.
Et bien, pourquoi pensez-vous que je sois parti ?
Je pourrais lui dire.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi Jake a quitté la ville.
Hé, fais gaffe, Jimmy.
Laissez-moi deviner.
Trop de pression ?
Je lis dans les esprits.
Je parie que vous étiez capitaine d'une équipe de foot,
premier de votre promo,
tout pour réussir.
Je me trompe ?
Ne changez pas de boulot.
Pourquoi ?
J'ai raté quelque chose ?
En fait il a même frappé le premier de promo.
Et ouais, c'est vrai.
Eric, tu dois avoir au moins un million d'histoires
sur les délires de ton frangin, non ?
Ouais, au moins tout ça.
On peut avoir 2 cafés à emporter, Mary ?
Ça vient.
Alors,
on a un plan ?
Essayer d'avoir des infos, des contacts.
On n'a pas eu de nouvelles de Gray depuis 2 jours, alors...
Non, Eric.
Est-ce qu'ON a un plan ?
Je parlerai à April ce soir.
Et ?
Et je n'aurai plus besoin de ces cafés comme
excuse pour venir te voir.
Les secrets d'une petit ville.
Allo.
<i>Bonjour, ici le Secrétaire Adjoint Walsh
du département de la Sécurité Intérieure.</i>
<i>N'ayez pas peur.</i>
<i>Si vous êtes en sécurité, restez où vous êtes.</i>
<i>N'essayez pas de partir.</i>
- C'est qui, Rob ?
<i>Nous reprendrons contact prochainement.</i>
<i>D'ici là, sachez que les secours sont en route.</i>
<i>Bonjour, ici le Secrétaire Adjoint Walsh

A la Mairie, ça te va ?
Ouais.
La Sécurité Intérieure ?
C'est ce qu'ils ont dit.
Alors ils s'occupent de tout ?
Et bien, ils sont censés prendre la situation en main
en cas de désastre.
Et maintenant ?
Pourquoi tu lui demande ça à elle ?
Elle est du Fisc.
Elle est de Washington.
Voilà ce qu'ils nous ont dit :
D'abord, ils rétablissent l'électricité, puis les
communications et après les transports.
Je suis à ça de boire des café au lait écrémé
et de faire du shiatsu.
Quelqu'un aurait 25 cents ?
S'ils peuvent nous appeler, peut-être qu'on peut aussi.
"Appel en cours"
"Roger"
Hé, est-ce que votre téléphone a sonné ?
Ouais, comme tout le monde.
Comme toutes les lignes de la ville.
- Pourquoi ?
Il y a un système de rappel de secours au Kansas.
En cas d'urgence, ça envoie juste un message.
C'est ce qu'on a tous entendu.
Pourquoi on ne peut pas appeler ?
Tout le monde essaye en même temps.
Les relais sont saturés.
Vous pensez que le courant est revenu pour de bon ?
Je ne sais pas, je ne compte pas trop dessus.
Hé, Skylar.
Ça marche ?
Non.
Il faut vraiment que je regarde mes mails.
Je veux dire, mes parents ont peut-être essayé
de me joindre depuis New York.
Euh, t'as essayé en tapant directement une adresse IP ?
Une quoi ?
C'est bizarre.
Quoi ?
Et ben, Internet a été créé par les militaires.
C'est supposé résister à une guerre nucléaire.
Alors pourquoi je peux pas vérifier mes mails ?
Allison.
Ça marche maintenant ?
Oui, mais...
pas pour nous.
L'accès est restreint.
Euh, Mademoiselle ?
- N'essayez pas.
- Oui, d'accord, merci..
"Bienvenue à la Kansas Liberty Bank"
"Carte retenue"
Votre machine a avalé ma carte.
Ça ne marche pas.
C'est ce que j'ai essayé de vous dire.
Merci.
Vous m'avez été d'une grande aide.
Salut Papa.
C'est la même chose sur toutes les chaînes ?
Pour l'instant.
Et la radio ?
Même message.
"Asseyez-vous et attendez."
T'as une sale tête.
J'ai pas dormi.
La prochaine fois, oublie les cartes, et rentre chez toi.
Tôt ou tard, les lignes vont se libérer.
Continuons d'appeler jusqu'a ce qu'on ait quelqu'un.
Appeler qui ?
Ben, cet appel de la Sécurité Intérieure vient de Topeka.
Commençons par là.
Ouais, mais tout le monde va penser à la même chose.
Il vaudrait mieux commencer par la Garde Nationale à Great Bend.
C'est une bonne idée, fiston.
On pourrait aller à la station, prendre de l'essence.
J'y ai déjà envoyé Jimmy.
Il est là-bas pour mettre en route les pompes.
D'accord, bon, il faut qu'on charge toutes les batteries.
D'accord.
On dirait que c'est déjà fait.
Où vas-tu ?
Chez moi.
Tu prends une douche ?
Rien ne t'échappe.
Va nettoyer la baignoire et remplis-la d'eau.
Pourquoi ?
L'eau n'arrive pas jusqu'à la douche par magie.
Si l'électricité disparaît à nouveau,
les pompes s'arrêteront aussi.
Donc on stocke tout ce qu'on peut.
Voilà pourquoi.
C'est ta fille, Rob, pas ton employée.
Et bien,
elle devrait moins parler, et plus écouter.
Tu devrais apprendre à la ménager.
Darcy.
Je ne sais pas combien de temps je serai là, donc quoi que
je doive lui apprendre, c'est maintenant que je dois le faire.
Dis moi, quand on saura ce qui se passe,
tu vas rester ou partir ?
Ne pense pas déjà à ce genre de choses.
Et bien, je ne peux pas m'en empêcher.
Te voilà finalement de retour.
Tu as toujours été douée pour repousser les pensées négatives.
Papa beaucoup moins.
Il en avait plus à repousser.
Quand tu es parti, tu as laissé un sacré bordel derrière toi.
Tu n'as pas idée du temps que ça a pris à ton père
pour arranger les choses.
Alors pourquoi ne m'a-t-il pas parlé ?
Parce qu'il savait que tu le prendrais mal.
Et notre famille est connue pour être têtue.
Chéri.
Je pense que tu dois lui dire la vérité.
Tu veux que je lui raconte ce que...
ce que j'ai fait pendant mon absence ?
Cette maison est trop petite pour contenir de grands secrets.
C'était quoi ça ?
Une surtension.
Les garçons...
Ouah, on dirait que rien n'a changé ici.
Comment as-tu fait pour récupérer si vite les enfants ?
Ce ne sont pas les derniers pour aller en récréation.
<i>Il faut que les choses reviennent à la normale.</i>
Quoi que ce puisse être.
Allez ! Allez ! Allez !
Dépêchez-vous, dépêchez-vous !
Emily ?
Emily.
Emily ?
Emily ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
Emily, réveille-toi.
Emily, réveille-toi.
Hé, les enfants.
Vous vous souvenez de cette alerte que nous avons simulée à l'école ?
Très bien.
Allez chercher vos copains et allez vous asseoir derrière la clôture.
Un, deux, trois, c'est parti !
Allez, vite !
Courez !
Elle va se réveiller ?
Oui.
Avec des superpouvoirs ?
Je ne pense pas.
Vas-y maintenant. Cours !
Cours, Lucas, cours !
Allez, Emily, allez.
Réveille-toi.
Je me demande quand ils vont arriver.
Tu as vraiment hâte de pouvoir filer, hein ?
Tu comptes toujours enregistrer ce rapport fiscal sur ma ferme ?
Ce n'est pas vraiment ma priorité,
mais c'est la raison qui m'a fait venir dans ce trou perdu.
Alors c'est un oui, un non ou un peut-être ?
C'est un éventuellement.
Ecoute, si ça ne tenait qu'à moi,
je verrais ce que je pourrais faire.
Mais c'est probablement mon Irish Coffee
qui me fait dire des trucs comme ça.
Tu as de la famille qui t'attend chez toi ?
J'ai des poissons rouges.
Je suis sûre que tu leur manques vraiment.
Je me demande ce qu'il se passe.
Mary, tu gardes ma note ouverte s'il te plaît ?
Ta note, Stanley ?
Oui, et continue à apporter des Irish Coffees...
jusqu'à ce que je récupère enfin ma ferme.
Vous avez entendu ce péquenaud ?
Rapportez-en.
"Identification :"
Allez on l'emmène. Faites lui une intraveineuse
et mettez lui un masque à oxygène.
Gardez un oeil sur son pouls
et prévenez moi si sa tension chute.
Nous devons la surveiller.
Où est Ashlee ?
Elle est allée chercher Alice.
Alice ?
Alice au pays des merveilles ?
A l'intérieur ?
Ashlee ?
Ashlee !
Ashlee ?
Chérie ?
Ashlee, chérie.
Ashlee, c'est Mlle Lisinski.
Ashlee !
Ashlee !
<i>Chef, on a un nouveau foyer. Terminé.
Dans la partie sud. Terminé.</i>
Compris.
On a un deuxième feu.
C'est au sud près du camping.
Mais on n'a pas assez de gars pour combattre celui-là.
Ils reviendront dès que possible.
Prenez le deuxième camion.
Bougez !
Camion 77, sortez une échelle là haut.
Que s'est-il passé ?
On dirait qu'elle a reçu une très forte décharge.
<i>Allez-y, verrouillez !</i>
Comment le feu a-t-il pris ?
Les lignes électriques.
Les lignes électriques ?
N'ouvrez pas les vannes d'eau.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
C'est un feu d'origine électrique.
Si on projette l'eau sur les câbles,
tout le monde va griller.
Johnston.
Je pensais que tu étais au ranch.
Les chevaux sont à l'abri.
Et les écuries ?
Il n'y a rien d'autre que de la crasse sur des kilomètres.
Elles ne risquent rien.
Tu ne vas pas aller voir ce feu.
J'ai laissé le Chef Carol et la moitié
du département aller à Denver.
Nous ne sommes plus qu'une poignée d'hommes.
Qui d'autre peut s'en charger ?
Johnston, si tu deviens encore plus malade que tu ne l'es déjà,
tu ne pourras plus aider personne.
<i>Papa, papa, tu es toujours là ?</i>
Oui Eric, j'arrive.
Non, non, non, non, descends et coupe
le réseau électrique de la bibliothèque.
Donne-moi cinq minutes.
On dirait que tu as eu gain de cause.
Ils ont besoin de moi ici.
Bien.
Le courant devrait être coupé d'ici cinq minutes.
Mettez vos hommes en position.
<i>On a couvert 4 blocs, à l'est de Maple.</i>
<i>J'ai un appel. Standby.</i>
Que faites-vous ?
Je m'assure qu'elle n'a pas fait une crise cardiaque.
Vous êtes en de bonnes mains.
<i>Le courant est coupé. Vous pouvez y aller.</i>
Compris.
C'est bon, ça y est, le courant est coupé.
Très bien, ouvrez les vannes.
C'est parti.
D'accord.
Qu'est ce qu'il y a ?
On n'a plus de pression.
Oh mon Dieu.
La station de pompage doit dépendre du même réseau.
En coupant le courant ici, on a coupé la station aussi.
Où est la station de pompage ?
En haut de la colline.
Détachez ces lances,
et essayez de trouver une bouche d'incendie dans le coin.
Oui, Chef.
Hé, Jake.
Stanley.
Dieu merci.
A la station de pompage, allez.
Heather.
Où est quoi ?
Heather ? Où est Heather ?
Eric.
Oui ?
J'ai peur que Heather soit toujours à l'intérieur.
Nan, ils ont dit qu'ils avaient évacué le bâtiment.
Tu en es sûr ?
<i>Ventilez cette zone.</i>
<i>Eric, qu'est ce que tu fais ?</i>
<i>Eric, non !</i>
Je me demande ce que Lindsay Lohan peut bien faire en ce moment.
Tu penses qu'elle est toujours vivante ?
J'essaye de retrouver mes parents, Lisa.
Je m'en fiche un peu.
Super.
Ma batterie est presque morte.
Excusez-moi, je suis désolé.
Vous vendez des chargeurs de téléphone ?
Mmm, quel type de téléphone ?
Je vérifie.
Merci.
Pourquoi tu aimes ce débile ?
Pourquoi tu aimes les actrices boulimiques stupides ?
Ouah.. on arrive.
Hé, Sean, pas de skateboard ici.
Lis la pancarte.
Hé, faut que vous alliez voir ça.
La bibliothèque est en feu et c'est même pas ma faute !
Des blessés ?
Sûrement.
Sky, allons-y.
Vas-y, je te rejoins.
Allons-y.
Celui-ci est universel, donc ça devrait marcher.
Mmm, on voulait allez voir le feu...
si tu veux venir.
Dale.
Vérifie que les extincteurs sont en état de marche,
tu veux bien ?
Je ferais mieux de rester.
Mais si tu veux je peux le charger,
 et tu peux revenir le chercher.
D'accord.
Mmm, si mes parents appellent...
J'irai te chercher.
Merci.
Allez, si on arrive à ouvrir la valve, on peut arroser le feu.
Dispositif d'arrêt automatique de la valve à l'intérieur.
Ashlee ?
Hé, Ashlee.
Sortons d'ici.
Allons-y. Viens...
Y'a quelqu'un par ici ?
Heather ?
Viens...
Hé, allez, sortez d'ici.
Mieux vaut écouter ce pompier, il à l'air en colère.
Viens avec moi.
Allez, par ici... venez !
Merde !
Ça veut pas se décoincer.
Merci, Stanley... tu es sûr que c'est celle-là ?
Fais-moi confiance, c'est bien la commande de secours.
La surtension a dû bloquer le relais de commande
de la valve en position d'arrêt.
Quoi ?
Et mec, tu me fait peur là.
Comment tu peux savoir ça ?
Comment tu peux ne pas le savoir ?
On dirait que personne n'y a touché depuis des années.
Personne n'y a touché.
C'est le moteur qui la déplace quand il y a du courant.
Pas de courant... pas de moteur.
Ouais... et pas d'eau.
Bon, ce qu'il nous faut, c'est un levier.
Tu sais quoi ?
Attends-moi ici.
Rentrez pas là-dedans, M'dame.
Mon mari est à l'intérieur !
Reculez, s'il vous plaît.
Ashlee, on va sortir par un autre moyen.
- Ça va ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Rien, c'est bon.
On doit passer par l'autre porte.
Non, non, c'est bloqué de ce côté.
De la fumée !
On doit la bloquer.
D'accord, d'accord, euh...
On peut utiliser ça ?
Ouais.
Bon, chérie, je veux que tu te mettes par terre,
et que tu essayes de pas respirer la fumée, d'accord ?
Tout va bien se passer, Ashlee.
Tout va bien se passer.
Eric ?
Il nous faut un autre serpent.
Ashlee, il faut que tu restes accroupie, comme si
tu allais sauter comme une grenouille, d'accord ?
Prêt ?
Ça va te protéger.
Ça va te protéger et t'aider à respirer.
Tiens.
Tiens.
<i>Tiens, respire avec ça.</i>
On l'a !
On l'a eu !
Ça marche, ça marche. On a de l'eau.
On va s'en sortir.
Allez, c'est le moment. Foutons le camp d'ici !
Allez, on y va !
On y va.
Quelqu'un doit aller les aider là-dedans !
Madame, reculez s'il vous plaît.
Ho, mon Dieu.
Tu es blessé ?
Non, ne t'inquiète pas pour moi.
La petite fille, elle a respiré pas mal de fumée.
April, tu peux la prendre ?
Ok, d'accord.
Tu vas t'en sortir, Ashlee.
Donne-moi la lunette.
Je vais voir s'ils ont de l'eau à la bibliothèque.
Ecoute...
c'est un cadeau de Noël, d'accord ?
Du calme.
Fais gaffe.
Tu vois quoi ?
Ça marche.
Ils ont de l'eau à la bibliothèque.
Et le feu du côté sud, il en est où ?
On dirait qu'il s'est arrêté vers le camping.
Il y a beaucoup de fumée.
Il y a un autre foyer.
Dans les bois, à l'est.
Quoi ?
Il est juste à côté de la maison d'Eric.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il fout ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Jack ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
April, April !
Eric, Eric, il y a un autre foyer.
On s'en occupera dès qu'on peut.
On a besoin d'aide pour dégager l'allée.
Eric. Le feu se répand.
Eric, il se dirige droit vers votre maison !
Tu comptes faire quoi ?
Il va droit vers ta maison.
Il n'y a rien à faire.
On est déjà pas assez nombreux.
Si on arrête pas le feu ici, il va atteindre la rue principale.
April ?
Il a raison.
"Quincaillerie"
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Eteindre un feu.
Besoin d'un coup de main ?
C'est bon.
Si je savais quoi que ce soit, je le dirais au Maire.
Et tu sais quoi ?
Pas grand chose.
J'ai eu le même message que tout le monde.
Tu veux de l'aide ?
Monte.
La première chose que je ferai en rentrant à Washington,
c'est brûler ces fringues.
Et vous, vous comptez faire quoi quand tout sera fini ?
J'ai rien de prévu.
Je compte juste vivre ma vie.
Avec Dudley, non ?
Ça n'arrivera pas.
Mais ça ne vous regarde vraiment pas.
En plus,
vous connaissez pas Eric autant que moi.
Heureusement.
Mais je connais ce genre d'hommes.
Ils ne quittent pas leurs femmes pour des filles comme nous.
"Des filles comme nous" ?
J'ai déjà connu ça.
Et bien, désolé de ruiner votre théorie, mais...
Eric doit parler de nous à sa femme ce soir.
Vraiment ?
Oui, tout à fait.
Bien, je n'ai rien dit alors.
A un couple heureux.
<i>Visez un peu plus haut vers la cheminée.</i>
Hé, on s'en occupe !
On s'en occupe !
Sauvez votre maison !
Et maintenant ?
De l'eau.
On va utiliser la pompe de la piscine.
Le système de filtration.
C'est vachement intelligent, Jake.
Mais où tu as appris tout ça ?
Je m'occupais d'une piscine.
Vas-y !
Ouvre !
Quoi ?
Ouvre la vanne !
Hawkins !
Hawkins !
Et merde !
Mais qu'est-ce que tu foutais ?
Le feu a coupé le courant.
Alors j'utilise le mien.
C'est bon ?
C'était bien pensé.
Ouais, je me suis occupé d'une piscine aussi.
Comment ça va, Ashlee ?
Ca va.
Elle a respiré un peu de fumée, mais ça ira.
Tu lui as sauvé la vie.
Des nouvelles des autres foyers ?
On maîtrise la partie au sud.
Et près de chez toi ?
Je ne sais pas. Ma femme...
Hé, où est April ?
Tu es toujours là.
Oui.
Mes parents... ?
Désolé.
Tiens, il est chargé.
Tu rentres chez toi maintenant ?
Tu vas rester là toute la nuit ?
J'ai pas d'autre endroit où aller.
Le feu a attaqué le terrain de camping.
Il est parti en fumée.
Oh Dale, je suis vraiment désolée.
Ça va.
Non, pas du tout.
Comment fais-tu pour être aussi calme ?
J'ai pas vraiment le choix.
Tu pourrais crier,
pleurer, frapper quelqu'un, briser quelque chose...
Viens.
Où vas-tu ?
On va commencer par le Maire.
Il nous aidera à te trouver un endroit pour dormir,
des habits et de l'argent.
Je peux m'occuper de moi tout seul. Ça ira.
J'essayais juste de t'aider.
Je sais.
Je sais.
Allez, laisse-moi te donner un coup de main.
Je l'ai.
Non.
Je te l'avais dit.
Désolé.
"Demande de dissolution de mariage"
Une demande de divorce ?
Je les avais demandés avant les bombes.
Je ne voulais pas que tu les voies.
Je ne le veux pas.
Ce n'est plus ce que je veux.
Je ne veux pas divorcer.
Et bien, je ne peux rien te reprocher April.
Ca fait un moment que ça va mal entre nous.
Je ne dirais pas mal.
Seulement...
pas très bien.
Pas maintenant.
Tout a changé, Eric.
Le monde a changé.
S'il te plaît.
Nous pouvons y réfléchir.
Seulement...
pas aujourd'hui.
Les couverts en argent,
pour quelle occasion ?
Oh, on se passe ce service depuis cinq générations.
Il n'a pas dû voir la lumière du jour
plus d'une demie douzaine de fois depuis que je l'ai.
A partir de maintenant, chaque soir est une occasion spéciale.
Tu as éteint la télé ?
Oui.
Ça me paraissait idiot de rester devant un écran vide
à attendre je sais pas qui me dire je sais pas quoi.
Ça m'a donné à réfléchir, pourtant.
Tu sais, cette...
cette chose que tu fuis ?
Elle n'est pas là-dehors.
Il est en haut, il attend le dîner.
Salut.
Je suis contente que vous soyez là.
Allez.
Dernier rappel tout le monde !
On ferme tôt ce soir !
Comment on va faire ?
Regardez le à la maison...
ou chez des amis.
Dernier...
Stanley, préviens tout le monde.
Mais je veux regarder.
Alors paye ta note.
C'est bon, j'y vais.
Regardez, regardez.
Tous les jours il y a quelque chose d'autre.
Comment allons nous gérer ça ?
De la même manière qu'aujourd'hui.
Nous avons perdus quelques maisons mais aucune vie.
Et cela, et pas un peu, grâce à toi.
Beaucoup de personnes disent que Jericho
a de la chance que tu sois revenu.
Et toi, tu leur dis quoi ?
Et bien j'ai essayé de les corriger,
mais personne ne m'écoute.
Tu sais ce qui a été le plus dur pour moi
de grandir comme ton fils ?
Ce n'est pas la politique, ou les attentes, c'est...
c'est que je t'ai toujours considéré bon pour juger les caractères,
et tu pensais que j'étais un crétin.
Quand j'ai quitté la ville, j'étais déterminé à te prouver
que tu avais tort, mais...
mais au lieu de ça, partout où j'allais,
il semblait que tu avais raison.
Papa.
Je n'étais pas seulement à San Diego.
Je m'en fous.
Quoi ?
Je m'en fous.
Si tu as besoin de me le dire, alors vas-y, mais...
où que tu sois allé, quoi que tu aies fait, ça t'a changé.
Tu étais peut-être un petit con quand tu as quitté cette maison,
mais c'est un gars formidable qui est revenu.
Je peux m'en accommoder.
"Passeports fichés"
"Passeport fiché"
Papa, maintenant que l'électricité est revenue,
on peut aller au cinéma ?
Bien sûr.
Et à des matchs de base-ball, et à l'aquarium, et...
On va déjà...
commencer avec un film, d'accord ?
D'accord.
Pourquoi as-tu travaillé dehors aujourd'hui ?
Papa devait réparer quelque chose.
Il y avait quoi dans cette grande boîte ?
Mes outils.
Allez Sam, c'est l'heure d'aller te coucher.
Tu vas venir me border, papa ?
D'accord.
Tu as réglé le problème ?
Papa y travaille.
Après toutes ces années où j'ai espéré voir toute la famille
réunie autour d'une table...
Fais attention à ce que tu souhaites.
C'est délicieux, Gail.
Merci.
Oui, qui aurait cru que de la purée instantanée
pouvait avoir si bon goût !
Et bien, ça ira mieux quand nous aurons de la vraie nourriture.
Du filet mignon au Roquefort.
Ne faites pas semblant de ne pas y avoir pensé !
Un cheeseburger avec des frites.
Du boeuf en conserve et du chou avec cette moutarde bien forte.
Ouais, je dirais pas non à une part de tarte aux myrtilles de maman.
Du poulet frit avec un épi de maïs frais.
Du gâteau au chocolat.
Excusez-moi, ils captent quelque chose au Bailey.
Allumons la télé.
Non ce sont les seuls à le recevoir.
On dirait qu'ils captent ça depuis Washington.
Tu viens, non ?
Oui, bien sûr.
Continue de la bouger, on n'a plus d'image.
Qu'est ce qu'il se passe ?
Que tout le monde se calme, OK ?
Ca remarchera dans 2 secondes.

Précédemment dans Jericho...
<i>On dirait que l'explosion venait de l'ouest,
peut-être de Denver.</i>
<i>Ça pouvait être un essai, ou un accident.</i>
<i>Mais si c'était une attaque, c'est le chaos dehors,</i>
<i>Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises
personnes sachent que Jericho est toujours là !</i>
<i>La mauvaise nouvelle, c'est qu'il y a eu
une autre explosion à Atlanta.</i>
<i>Ho, mon Dieu, on a quelque chose !</i>
<i>Ils rapportent la nouvelle, ou ils ont derrière tout ça ?</i>
<i>Recrute autant d'adjoints que tu peux.</i>
<i>Aide-les à trouver de l'essence.</i>
<i>La clinique va bientôt être à court.</i>
<i>J'ai pas pu trouver de container à pesticide vide.</i>
<i>Je pense que ce réservoir d'eau fera l'affaire.</i>
<i>Non, non, non, il faut pas d'acier.</i>
<i>Trop de risque d'électricité statique.</i>
<i>L'essence a été secouée là-dedans.</i>
<i>Un étincelle, et tout va nous péter à la figure.</i>
<i>On n'a pas le temps de chercher autre chose.</i>
<i>Aidez-moi.</i>
<i>C'est un réfugié de Denver.</i>
<i>Vous le reconnaissez ?</i>
<i>Non.</i>
<i>On a besoin de renseignements.</i>
<i>Où sont-ils ?</i>
<i>Un lac en flamme.</i>
<i>Il lui faut de la morphine.</i>
<i>Pourquoi êtes-vous retourné à Denver ?</i>
<i>Je ne pouvais pas les laisser mourir.</i>
<i>C'était une erreur, Vic,</i>
<i>maintenant, il nous manque un homme.</i>
<i>Il est mort.</i>
J'en ai marre de la guerre.
Personne ne gagne réellement.
Moi aussi.
Je pense qu'on peut jouer au 8 Américain en attendant.
Ou à la Dame de Pique ?
J'arrête pour cette nuit.
Comme tu veux,
mais ça fait des heures qu'il ne fait plus nuit.
Vous voulez tous du café ?
Un Irish pour moi.
Alors, Mimi, qu'est-ce que tu ferais
si tu retournais à Washington ?
Dormir.
Vous savez ce qu'il y a de pire ici pour dormir ?
- Quoi ?
- Le Calme.
Je ne sais pas comment vous supportez ça.
C'est comme si j'avais une chambre d'écho dans ma tête.
Et bien, pourquoi pensez-vous que je sois parti ?
Je pourrais lui dire.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi Jake a quitté la ville.
Hé, fais gaffe, Jimmy.
Laissez-moi deviner.
Trop de pression ?
Je lis dans les esprits.
Je parie que vous étiez capitaine d'une équipe de foot,
premier de votre promo,
tout pour réussir.
Je me trompe ?
Ne changez pas de boulot.
Pourquoi ?
J'ai raté quelque chose ?
En fait il a même frappé le premier de promo.
Et ouais, c'est vrai.
Eric, tu dois avoir au moins un million d'histoires
sur les délires de ton frangin, non ?
Ouais, au moins tout ça.
On peut avoir 2 cafés à emporter, Mary ?
Ça vient.
Alors,
on a un plan ?
Essayer d'avoir des infos, des contacts.
On n'a pas eu de nouvelles de Gray depuis 2 jours, alors...
Non, Eric.
Est-ce qu'ON a un plan ?
Je parlerai à April ce soir.
Et ?
Et je n'aurai plus besoin de ces cafés comme
excuse pour venir te voir.
Les secrets d'une petit ville.
Allo.
<i>Bonjour, ici le Secrétaire Adjoint Walsh
du département de la Sécurité Intérieure.</i>
<i>N'ayez pas peur.</i>
<i>Si vous êtes en sécurité, restez où vous êtes.</i>
<i>N'essayez pas de partir.</i>
- C'est qui, Rob ?
<i>Nous reprendrons contact prochainement.</i>
<i>D'ici là, sachez que les secours sont en route.</i>

A la Mairie, ça te va ?
Ouais.
La Sécurité Intérieure ?
C'est ce qu'ils ont dit.
Alors ils s'occupent de tout ?
Et bien, ils sont censés prendre la situation en main
en cas de désastre.
Et maintenant ?
Pourquoi tu lui demande ça à elle ?
Elle est du Fisc.
Elle est de Washington.
Voilà ce qu'ils nous ont dit :
D'abord, ils rétablissent l'électricité, puis les
communications et après les transports.
Je suis à ça de boire des café au lait écrémé
et de faire du shiatsu.
Quelqu'un aurait 25 cents ?
S'ils peuvent nous appeler, peut-être qu'on peut aussi.
"Appel en cours"
"Roger"
Hé, est-ce que votre téléphone a sonné ?
Ouais, comme tout le monde.
Comme toutes les lignes de la ville.
- Pourquoi ?
Il y a un système de rappel de secours au Kansas.
En cas d'urgence, ça envoie juste un message.
C'est ce qu'on a tous entendu.
Pourquoi on ne peut pas appeler ?
Tout le monde essaye en même temps.
Les relais sont saturés.
Vous pensez que le courant est revenu pour de bon ?
Je ne sais pas, je ne compte pas trop dessus.
Hé, Skylar.
Ça marche ?
Non.
Il faut vraiment que je regarde mes mails.
Je veux dire, mes parents ont peut-être essayé
de me joindre depuis New York.
Euh, t'as essayé en tapant directement une adresse IP ?
Une quoi ?
C'est bizarre.
Quoi ?
Et ben, Internet a été créé par les militaires.
C'est supposé résister à une guerre nucléaire.
Alors pourquoi je peux pas vérifier mes mails ?
Allison.
Ça marche maintenant ?
Oui, mais...
pas pour nous.
L'accès est restreint.
Euh, Mademoiselle ?
- N'essayez pas.
- Oui, d'accord, merci..
"Bienvenue à la Kansas Liberty Bank"
"Carte retenue"
Votre machine a avalé ma carte.
Ça ne marche pas.
C'est ce que j'ai essayé de vous dire.
Merci.
Vous m'avez été d'une grande aide.
Salut Papa.
C'est la même chose sur toutes les chaînes ?
Pour l'instant.
Et la radio ?
Même message.
"Asseyez-vous et attendez."
T'as une sale tête.
J'ai pas dormi.
La prochaine fois, oublie les cartes, et rentre chez toi.
Tôt ou tard, les lignes vont se libérer.
Continuons d'appeler jusqu'a ce qu'on ait quelqu'un.
Appeler qui ?
Ben, cet appel de la Sécurité Intérieure vient de Topeka.
Commençons par là.
Ouais, mais tout le monde va penser à la même chose.
Il vaudrait mieux commencer par la Garde Nationale à Great Bend.
C'est une bonne idée, fiston.
On pourrait aller à la station, prendre de l'essence.
J'y ai déjà envoyé Jimmy.
Il est là-bas pour mettre en route les pompes.
D'accord, bon, il faut qu'on charge toutes les batteries.
D'accord.
On dirait que c'est déjà fait.
Où vas-tu ?
Chez moi.
Tu prends une douche ?
Rien ne t'échappe.
Va nettoyer la baignoire et remplis-la d'eau.
Pourquoi ?
L'eau n'arrive pas jusqu'à la douche par magie.
Si l'électricité disparaît à nouveau,
les pompes s'arrêteront aussi.
Donc on stocke tout ce qu'on peut.
Voilà pourquoi.
C'est ta fille, Rob, pas ton employée.
Et bien,
elle devrait moins parler, et plus écouter.
Tu devrais apprendre à la ménager.
Darcy.
Je ne sais pas combien de temps je serai là, donc quoi que
je doive lui apprendre, c'est maintenant que je dois le faire.
Dis moi, quand on saura ce qui se passe,
tu vas rester ou partir ?
Ne pense pas déjà à ce genre de choses.
Et bien, je ne peux pas m'en empêcher.
Te voilà finalement de retour.
Tu as toujours été douée pour repousser les pensées négatives.
Papa beaucoup moins.
Il en avait plus à repousser.
Quand tu es parti, tu as laissé un sacré bordel derrière toi.
Tu n'as pas idée du temps que ça a pris à ton père
pour arranger les choses.
Alors pourquoi ne m'a-t-il pas parlé ?
Parce qu'il savait que tu le prendrais mal.
Et notre famille est connue pour être têtue.
Chéri.
Je pense que tu dois lui dire la vérité.
Tu veux que je lui raconte ce que...
ce que j'ai fait pendant mon absence ?
Cette maison est trop petite pour contenir de grands secrets.
C'était quoi ça ?
Une surtension.
Les garçons...
Ouah, on dirait que rien n'a changé ici.
Comment as-tu fait pour récupérer si vite les enfants ?
Ce ne sont pas les derniers pour aller en récréation.
<i>Il faut que les choses reviennent à la normale.</i>
Quoi que ce puisse être.
Allez ! Allez ! Allez !
Dépêchez-vous, dépêchez-vous !
Emily ?
Emily.
Emily ?
Emily ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
Emily, réveille-toi.
Emily, réveille-toi.
Hé, les enfants.
Vous vous souvenez de cette alerte que nous avons simulée à l'école ?
Très bien.
Allez chercher vos copains et allez vous asseoir derrière la clôture.
Un, deux, trois, c'est parti !
Allez, vite !
Courez !
Elle va se réveiller ?
Oui.
Avec des superpouvoirs ?
Je ne pense pas.
Vas-y maintenant. Cours !
Cours, Lucas, cours !
Allez, Emily, allez.
Réveille-toi.
Je me demande quand ils vont arriver.
Tu as vraiment hâte de pouvoir filer, hein ?
Tu comptes toujours enregistrer ce rapport fiscal sur ma ferme ?
Ce n'est pas vraiment ma priorité,
mais c'est la raison qui m'a fait venir dans ce trou perdu.
Alors c'est un oui, un non ou un peut-être ?
C'est un éventuellement.
Ecoute, si ça ne tenait qu'à moi,
je verrais ce que je pourrais faire.
Mais c'est probablement mon Irish Coffee
qui me fait dire des trucs comme ça.
Tu as de la famille qui t'attend chez toi ?
J'ai des poissons rouges.
Je suis sûre que tu leur manques vraiment.
Je me demande ce qu'il se passe.
Mary, tu gardes ma note ouverte s'il te plaît ?
Ta note, Stanley ?
Oui, et continue à apporter des Irish Coffees...
jusqu'à ce que je récupère enfin ma ferme.
Vous avez entendu ce péquenaud ?
Rapportez-en.
"Identification :"
Allez on l'emmène. Faites lui une intraveineuse
et mettez lui un masque à oxygène.
Gardez un oeil sur son pouls
et prévenez moi si sa tension chute.
Nous devons la surveiller.
Où est Ashlee ?
Elle est allée chercher Alice.
Alice ?
Alice au pays des merveilles ?
A l'intérieur ?
Ashlee ?
Ashlee !
Ashlee ?
Chérie ?
Ashlee, chérie.
Ashlee, c'est Mlle Lisinski.
Ashlee !
Ashlee !
<i>Chef, on a un nouveau foyer. Terminé.
Dans la partie sud. Terminé.</i>
Compris.
On a un deuxième feu.
C'est au sud près du camping.
Mais on n'a pas assez de gars pour combattre celui-là.
Ils reviendront dès que possible.
Prenez le deuxième camion.
Bougez !
Camion 77, sortez une échelle là haut.
Que s'est-il passé ?
On dirait qu'elle a reçu une très forte décharge.
<i>Allez-y, verrouillez !</i>
Comment le feu a-t-il pris ?
Les lignes électriques.
Les lignes électriques ?
N'ouvrez pas les vannes d'eau.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
C'est un feu d'origine électrique.
Si on projette l'eau sur les câbles,
tout le monde va griller.
Johnston.
Je pensais que tu étais au ranch.
Les chevaux sont à l'abri.
Et les écuries ?
Il n'y a rien d'autre que de la crasse sur des kilomètres.
Elles ne risquent rien.
Tu ne vas pas aller voir ce feu.
J'ai laissé le Chef Carol et la moitié
du département aller à Denver.
Nous ne sommes plus qu'une poignée d'hommes.
Qui d'autre peut s'en charger ?
Johnston, si tu deviens encore plus malade que tu ne l'es déjà,
tu ne pourras plus aider personne.
<i>Papa, papa, tu es toujours là ?</i>
Oui Eric, j'arrive.
Non, non, non, non, descends et coupe
le réseau électrique de la bibliothèque.
Donne-moi cinq minutes.
On dirait que tu as eu gain de cause.
Ils ont besoin de moi ici.
Bien.
Le courant devrait être coupé d'ici cinq minutes.
Mettez vos hommes en position.
<i>On a couvert 4 blocs, à l'est de Maple.</i>
<i>J'ai un appel. Standby.</i>
Que faites-vous ?
Je m'assure qu'elle n'a pas fait une crise cardiaque.
Vous êtes en de bonnes mains.
<i>Le courant est coupé. Vous pouvez y aller.</i>
Compris.
C'est bon, ça y est, le courant est coupé.
Très bien, ouvrez les vannes.
C'est parti.
D'accord.
Qu'est ce qu'il y a ?
On n'a plus de pression.
Oh mon Dieu.
La station de pompage doit dépendre du même réseau.
En coupant le courant ici, on a coupé la station aussi.
Où est la station de pompage ?
En haut de la colline.
Détachez ces lances,
et essayez de trouver une bouche d'incendie dans le coin.
Oui, Chef.
Hé, Jake.
Stanley.
Dieu merci.
A la station de pompage, allez.
Heather.
Où est quoi ?
Heather ? Où est Heather ?
Eric.
Oui ?
J'ai peur que Heather soit toujours à l'intérieur.
Nan, ils ont dit qu'ils avaient évacué le bâtiment.
Tu en es sûr ?
<i>Ventilez cette zone.</i>
<i>Eric, qu'est ce que tu fais ?</i>
<i>Eric, non !</i>
Je me demande ce que Lindsay Lohan peut bien faire en ce moment.
Tu penses qu'elle est toujours vivante ?
J'essaye de retrouver mes parents, Lisa.
Je m'en fiche un peu.
Super.
Ma batterie est presque morte.
Excusez-moi, je suis désolé.
Vous vendez des chargeurs de téléphone ?
Mmm, quel type de téléphone ?
Je vérifie.
Merci.
Pourquoi tu aimes ce débile ?
Pourquoi tu aimes les actrices boulimiques stupides ?
Ouah.. on arrive.
Hé, Sean, pas de skateboard ici.
Lis la pancarte.
Hé, faut que vous alliez voir ça.
La bibliothèque est en feu et c'est même pas ma faute !
Des blessés ?
Sûrement.
Sky, allons-y.
Vas-y, je te rejoins.
Allons-y.
Celui-ci est universel, donc ça devrait marcher.
Mmm, on voulait allez voir le feu...
si tu veux venir.
Dale.
Vérifie que les extincteurs sont en état de marche,
tu veux bien ?
Je ferais mieux de rester.
Mais si tu veux je peux le charger,
 et tu peux revenir le chercher.
D'accord.
Mmm, si mes parents appellent...
J'irai te chercher.
Merci.
Allez, si on arrive à ouvrir la valve, on peut arroser le feu.
Dispositif d'arrêt automatique de la valve à l'intérieur.
Ashlee ?
Hé, Ashlee.
Sortons d'ici.
Allons-y. Viens...
Y'a quelqu'un par ici ?
Heather ?
Viens...
Hé, allez, sortez d'ici.
Mieux vaut écouter ce pompier, il à l'air en colère.
Viens avec moi.
Allez, par ici... venez !
Merde !
Ça veut pas se décoincer.
Merci, Stanley... tu es sûr que c'est celle-là ?
Fais-moi confiance, c'est bien la commande de secours.
La surtension a dû bloquer le relais de commande
de la valve en position d'arrêt.
Quoi ?
Et mec, tu me fait peur là.
Comment tu peux savoir ça ?
Comment tu peux ne pas le savoir ?
On dirait que personne n'y a touché depuis des années.
Personne n'y a touché.
C'est le moteur qui la déplace quand il y a du courant.
Pas de courant... pas de moteur.
Ouais... et pas d'eau.
Bon, ce qu'il nous faut, c'est un levier.
Tu sais quoi ?
Attends-moi ici.
Rentrez pas là-dedans, M'dame.
Mon mari est à l'intérieur !
Reculez, s'il vous plaît.
Ashlee, on va sortir par un autre moyen.
- Ça va ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Rien, c'est bon.
On doit passer par l'autre porte.
Non, non, c'est bloqué de ce côté.
De la fumée !
On doit la bloquer.
D'accord, d'accord, euh...
On peut utiliser ça ?
Ouais.
Bon, chérie, je veux que tu te mettes par terre,
et que tu essayes de pas respirer la fumée, d'accord ?
Tout va bien se passer, Ashlee.
Tout va bien se passer.
Eric ?
Il nous faut un autre serpent.
Ashlee, il faut que tu restes accroupie, comme si
tu allais sauter comme une grenouille, d'accord ?
Prêt ?
Ça va te protéger.
Ça va te protéger et t'aider à respirer.
Tiens.
Tiens.
<i>Tiens, respire avec ça.</i>
On l'a !
On l'a eu !
Ça marche, ça marche. On a de l'eau.
On va s'en sortir.
Allez, c'est le moment. Foutons le camp d'ici !
Allez, on y va !
On y va.
Quelqu'un doit aller les aider là-dedans !
Madame, reculez s'il vous plaît.
Ho, mon Dieu.
Tu es blessé ?
Non, ne t'inquiète pas pour moi.
La petite fille, elle a respiré pas mal de fumée.
April, tu peux la prendre ?
Ok, d'accord.
Tu vas t'en sortir, Ashlee.
Donne-moi la lunette.
Je vais voir s'ils ont de l'eau à la bibliothèque.
Ecoute...
c'est un cadeau de Noël, d'accord ?
Du calme.
Fais gaffe.
Tu vois quoi ?
Ça marche.
Ils ont de l'eau à la bibliothèque.
Et le feu du côté sud, il en est où ?
On dirait qu'il s'est arrêté vers le camping.
Il y a beaucoup de fumée.
Il y a un autre foyer.
Dans les bois, à l'est.
Quoi ?
Il est juste à côté de la maison d'Eric.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il fout ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Jack ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
April, April !
Eric, Eric, il y a un autre foyer.
On s'en occupera dès qu'on peut.
On a besoin d'aide pour dégager l'allée.
Eric. Le feu se répand.
Eric, il se dirige droit vers votre maison !
Tu comptes faire quoi ?
Il va droit vers ta maison.
Il n'y a rien à faire.
On est déjà pas assez nombreux.
Si on arrête pas le feu ici, il va atteindre la rue principale.
April ?
Il a raison.
"Quincaillerie"
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Eteindre un feu.
Besoin d'un coup de main ?
C'est bon.
Si je savais quoi que ce soit, je le dirais au Maire.
Et tu sais quoi ?
Pas grand chose.
J'ai eu le même message que tout le monde.
Tu veux de l'aide ?
Monte.
La première chose que je ferai en rentrant à Washington,
c'est brûler ces fringues.
Et vous, vous comptez faire quoi quand tout sera fini ?
J'ai rien de prévu.
Je compte juste vivre ma vie.
Avec Dudley, non ?
Ça n'arrivera pas.
Mais ça ne vous regarde vraiment pas.
En plus,
vous connaissez pas Eric autant que moi.
Heureusement.
Mais je connais ce genre d'hommes.
Ils ne quittent pas leurs femmes pour des filles comme nous.
"Des filles comme nous" ?
J'ai déjà connu ça.
Et bien, désolé de ruiner votre théorie, mais...
Eric doit parler de nous à sa femme ce soir.
Vraiment ?
Oui, tout à fait.
Bien, je n'ai rien dit alors.
A un couple heureux.
<i>Visez un peu plus haut vers la cheminée.</i>
Hé, on s'en occupe !
On s'en occupe !
Sauvez votre maison !
Et maintenant ?
De l'eau.
On va utiliser la pompe de la piscine.
Le système de filtration.
C'est vachement intelligent, Jake.
Mais où tu as appris tout ça ?
Je m'occupais d'une piscine.
Vas-y !
Ouvre !
Quoi ?
Ouvre la vanne !
Hawkins !
Hawkins !
Et merde !
Mais qu'est-ce que tu foutais ?
Le feu a coupé le courant.
Alors j'utilise le mien.
C'est bon ?
C'était bien pensé.
Ouais, je me suis occupé d'une piscine aussi.
Comment ça va, Ashlee ?
Ca va.
Elle a respiré un peu de fumée, mais ça ira.
Tu lui as sauvé la vie.
Des nouvelles des autres foyers ?
On maîtrise la partie au sud.
Et près de chez toi ?
Je ne sais pas. Ma femme...
Hé, où est April ?
Tu es toujours là.
Oui.
Mes parents... ?
Désolé.
Tiens, il est chargé.
Tu rentres chez toi maintenant ?
Tu vas rester là toute la nuit ?
J'ai pas d'autre endroit où aller.
Le feu a attaqué le terrain de camping.
Il est parti en fumée.
Oh Dale, je suis vraiment désolée.
Ça va.
Non, pas du tout.
Comment fais-tu pour être aussi calme ?
J'ai pas vraiment le choix.
Tu pourrais crier,
pleurer, frapper quelqu'un, briser quelque chose...
Viens.
Où vas-tu ?
On va commencer par le Maire.
Il nous aidera à te trouver un endroit pour dormir,
des habits et de l'argent.
Je peux m'occuper de moi tout seul. Ça ira.
J'essayais juste de t'aider.
Je sais.
Je sais.
Allez, laisse-moi te donner un coup de main.
Je l'ai.
Non.
Je te l'avais dit.
Désolé.
"Demande de dissolution de mariage"
Une demande de divorce ?
Je les avais demandés avant les bombes.
Je ne voulais pas que tu les voies.
Je ne le veux pas.
Ce n'est plus ce que je veux.
Je ne veux pas divorcer.
Et bien, je ne peux rien te reprocher April.
Ca fait un moment que ça va mal entre nous.
Je ne dirais pas mal.
Seulement...
pas très bien.
Pas maintenant.
Tout a changé, Eric.
Le monde a changé.
S'il te plaît.
Nous pouvons y réfléchir.
Seulement...
pas aujourd'hui.
Les couverts en argent,
pour quelle occasion ?
Oh, on se passe ce service depuis cinq générations.
Il n'a pas dû voir la lumière du jour
plus d'une demie douzaine de fois depuis que je l'ai.
A partir de maintenant, chaque soir est une occasion spéciale.
Tu as éteint la télé ?
Oui.
Ça me paraissait idiot de rester devant un écran vide
à attendre je sais pas qui me dire je sais pas quoi.
Ça m'a donné à réfléchir, pourtant.
Tu sais, cette...
cette chose que tu fuis ?
Elle n'est pas là-dehors.
Il est en haut, il attend le dîner.
Salut.
Je suis contente que vous soyez là.
Allez.
Dernier rappel tout le monde !
On ferme tôt ce soir !
Comment on va faire ?
Regardez le à la maison...
ou chez des amis.
Dernier...
Stanley, préviens tout le monde.
Mais je veux regarder.
Alors paye ta note.
C'est bon, j'y vais.
Regardez, regardez.
Tous les jours il y a quelque chose d'autre.
Comment allons nous gérer ça ?
De la même manière qu'aujourd'hui.
Nous avons perdus quelques maisons mais aucune vie.
Et cela, et pas un peu, grâce à toi.
Beaucoup de personnes disent que Jericho
a de la chance que tu sois revenu.
Et toi, tu leur dis quoi ?
Et bien j'ai essayé de les corriger,
mais personne ne m'écoute.
Tu sais ce qui a été le plus dur pour moi
de grandir comme ton fils ?
Ce n'est pas la politique, ou les attentes, c'est...
c'est que je t'ai toujours considéré bon pour juger les caractères,
et tu pensais que j'étais un crétin.
Quand j'ai quitté la ville, j'étais déterminé à te prouver
que tu avais tort, mais...
mais au lieu de ça, partout où j'allais,
il semblait que tu avais raison.
Papa.
Je n'étais pas seulement à San Diego.
Je m'en fous.
Quoi ?
Je m'en fous.
Si tu as besoin de me le dire, alors vas-y, mais...
où que tu sois allé, quoi que tu aies fait, ça t'a changé.
Tu étais peut-être un petit con quand tu as quitté cette maison,
mais c'est un gars formidable qui est revenu.
Je peux m'en accommoder.
"Passeports fichés"
"Passeport fiché"
Papa, maintenant que l'électricité est revenue,
on peut aller au cinéma ?
Bien sûr.
Et à des matchs de base-ball, et à l'aquarium, et...
On va déjà...
commencer avec un film, d'accord ?
D'accord.
Pourquoi as-tu travaillé dehors aujourd'hui ?
Papa devait réparer quelque chose.
Il y avait quoi dans cette grande boîte ?
Mes outils.
Allez Sam, c'est l'heure d'aller te coucher.
Tu vas venir me border, papa ?
D'accord.
Tu as réglé le problème ?
Papa y travaille.
Après toutes ces années où j'ai espéré voir toute la famille
réunie autour d'une table...
Fais attention à ce que tu souhaites.
C'est délicieux, Gail.
Merci.
Oui, qui aurait cru que de la purée instantanée
pouvait avoir si bon goût !
Et bien, ça ira mieux quand nous aurons de la vraie nourriture.
Du filet mignon au Roquefort.
Ne faites pas semblant de ne pas y avoir pensé !
Un cheeseburger avec des frites.
Du boeuf en conserve et du chou avec cette moutarde bien forte.
Ouais, je dirais pas non à une part de tarte aux myrtilles de maman.
Du poulet frit avec un épi de maïs frais.
Du gâteau au chocolat.
Excusez-moi, ils captent quelque chose au Bailey.
Allumons la télé.
Non ce sont les seuls à le recevoir.
On dirait qu'ils captent ça depuis Washington.
Tu viens, non ?
Oui, bien sûr.
Continue de la bouger, on n'a plus d'image.
Qu'est ce qu'il se passe ?
Que tout le monde se calme, OK ?
Ca remarchera dans 2 secondes.

" All right,it looks like the explosion
came from the west,maybe denver.
This could've been a test,
could've been an accident.
But if it was an attack
and there's chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people
knowing that jericho is still here.
The unfortunate truth is there
was another explosion in atlanta.
Oh,my god,we got something !
Were they just reporting it or
are they behind it ?
Hire as many deputies as you can.
Use them to help you get gas.
Clinic's running low.
Couldn't find an empty pesticide container.
I thought this water tank might do.
No,no,no,we can't use steel.
There's too much risk of static.
The gas has been sloshing around in there.
One spark,the whole thing could blow sky high.
We don't have time to look for something else.
help.
He's a refugee from denver.
You recognize him ?
No.
We need information.
Where are they ?
It burns.
He needs morphine.
why did you go back to denver ?
I couldn't let them die.
Well,it was a mistake,vic.
because now we are a man down.
he's gone.
I'm tired of war.
No one ever really wins.
Stanley: Me,too.
Guess we can play crazy eights instead.
Or hearts ?
I'm calling it a night.
You can call it whatever you want,
but it stopped being night hours ago.
Y'all want coffee ?
Make mine an irish.
So,mimi,what would you be doing
if you were back home in D. C.  ?
Sleeping.
You know the hardest thing out
sleeping in this dump ?
What ?
The quiet.
I don't know how you stand it.
It's like my brain is an echo chamber.
Well,why do you think I left town ?
I could tell her.
What ?
Why jake left town.
Hey,watch it,jimmy.
Let me guess.
The pressure got to be too much.
I'm a people reader.
I'm betting captain of the football team,
prom king.
most likely to succeed.
Am I right ?
Don't quit your day joB.
why ?
What am i missing here ?
I think he beat up the prom king.
Oh,yeah,I did.
Eric,you must have a million stories
about your brother screwing up,right ?
Yeah,at least that many.
Could we get a couple coffees to go,mary ?
Coming up.
So.
do we have a plan ?
just try to get news,make contact.
We haven't heard from gray in a couple days,so.
no,eric.
do we have a plan ?
I will talk to april tonight.
Then ?
And then I won't need coffee
as an excuse to come see you.

To town hall,you good ?
Yeah.
Homeland security ?
That's what they said.
So they're in charge now ?
Well,they're supposed to be in charge
in case of a disaster.
So what happens next ?
Why are you asking her ? She's from the irs.
She's from D. C.
This is what they told us.
First,they restore power,then
communication,then transportation.
I am this close to non-fat lattes and shiatsu.
Does anybody have a quarter ?
If they can call in,maybe we can call out.
calling roger
hey,did your phone ring ?
Yeah,everyone's did.
All the land lines in town.
Why ?
Because kansas has a reverse 911 system.
If there's an emergency,it just pulses out a call.
That's what we all heard.
Why can't we call out ?
Everybody's trying to use the phone at the same time.
System's overloaded.
You think the power's back for good ?
I don't know,I'm not gonna count on it.
Hey,skylar.
Any luck ?
No.
I really need to check my e-mail.
I mean,my parents could've tried
to contact me from new york.
Well,have you tried typing a straight ip address ?
A what ?
It's weird.
What ?
Well,the internet was built by the military.
It's supposed to survive nuclear war.
So why can't I check my e-mail ?
Allison.
Is it working now ?
it is,but.
not for us.
We're being blocked out.
Uh,miss ?
You can't do thaT.
Yeah,okay,thanks.
welcome to kansas liberty bank
card held
Your machine just ate my card.
Doesn't work.
That's what I tried to tell you.
Thank you.
You're just so helpful.
Hey,dad.
It's the same thing on every channel ?
So far.
What about the radio ?
Same message.sit and wait.
You look like crap.
I didn't sleep.
Next time put the cards down,go home.
Sooner or later,the phones are gonna free up.
Let's keep calling out until we reach somebody.
Calling who ?
Well,that homeland security message
came out of topeka; let's start there.
Yeah,but everybody's thinking that.
I say we start with the national
guard base in great bend.
That's a good idea,son.
We should get to the gas station,
get some gas while.
I already sent jimmy.
He's there now running the pumps.
All right,well,we need to charge our batteries.
All right.
Looks like you got it covered.
Where you going ?
Home.
You take a shower ?
Nothing gets past you.
Go clean the tub and fill it up.
Why ?
The water doesn't get to that shower by magic.
If the power goes out again,
so do the pumps that get it there.
So we store what we can.
That is why.
she is your daughter,rob,not your employee.
Well.
she needs to talk less and listen more.
You need to learn to ease up on her.
Darcy.
I don't know how long I'll be here,so whatever
i gotta teach her,it needs to happen now.
you know,when we find out what's going on,
are you gonna stay or leave ?
Don't think about that yet.
Well,I can't help it.
I finally have you back.
you were always good at blocking out the bad.
Dad,not so much.
He's had more to block out.
When you left,you left quite a mess.
You have no idea of the lengths
you father went to to square things.
Then why didn't he talk to me ?
Because he knew you'd resent it.
And there's a stubborn streak
that runs in the family.
Honey.
I think you owe him the truth.
You want me to tell him about my.
about my time away ?
This house is too small for big secrets.
what was that ?
It's a power spike.
Boys.
wow,looks like business as usual.
How'd you get your kids back so quick ?
Always lead with recess.
Emily: Got to get things back to normal.
Whatever that is.
Go ! Go ! Go !
Hurry,hurry !
emily ?
Emily.
emily ?
Emily ?
Oh,my god.
Emily,wake up.
Emily,wake up.
Uh,everybody.
do you remember the emergency
drills we did at school ?
okay.
Go find your buddy and go sit behind the fence.
One,two,three,go !
Come on,quickly.
Go.
Is she going to wake up ?
Yes.
With super powers ?
Probably not.
Now,go. Go !
Go,lucas,go !
Come on,emily,come on.
Wake up.
Wonder when they're going to come.
You really can't wait to fly this coop,huh ?
Are you still going to file that
irs report on my farm ?
That's not exactly my first order of business,
but it is the reason I fell into this godforsaken
hell hole in the first place.
So is that a yes,no or maybe ?
It's an eventually.
Look,if it were up to me,I'd see what I could do.
But that's probably justthe
irish coffee talking.
You got a family back home ?
I have fish.
I'm sure they really miss you.
I wonder what that's about.
Mary,keep my tab open,will ya ?
Your tab,stanley ?
Yeah,and keep the irish coffees coming.
Till I get my farm back at least.
You heard the hillbilly.
Keep 'em coming.
enter id
okay,let's board her. Get an I. V. Started

Keep an eye on the pulse and let me

Ashlee,honey.
Ashlee,it's ms. Lisinski.

Chief,we've got another blaze over
on the south side. Over.
Copy that.
We've got a second fire.
It's south side near the trailer park.
But we don't have enough guys to fight this one.
They'll come back as soon as they can.
Take the second truck.
Move !
truck 77,let's get a ladder up there.
what happened ?
Looks like she got hit with a lot of voltage.
Go ahead,lock it in !
How'd it start ?
Power lines.
Power lines ?
Hold the water.
What's wrong ?
Electrical fire.
Spray water on electricity everybody
it touches gets fried.
Johnston.
I thought you were at the ranch.
The horses are safe.
What about the stables ?
There's nothing but dirt around for miles.
They're fine.
You are not going to that fire.
I let chief carrol and half
the department go to denver.
We're down to a handful of men.
Who can handle it.
Johnston,if you get any sicker than you already
are,you're not going to be any use to anybody.
Dad,dad,are you still there ?
Yeah,eric,I'm on my way.
No,no,no,no,go downstairs and turn off
the power grid to the library.
Give me five minutes.
Looks like you get your way.
They can use me here.
Good.
The power should be cut in five minutes.
Get your men in position.
Cover one-seven four blocks east of maple.
Uh,one call. Stand by.
What are you doing ?
Making sure she didn't have a heart attack.
you're in good hands.
Power's down. You're good to go.
Copy.
All right,that's it,power's down.
Okay,open them up.
They're on.
Okay.
What's going on ?
We lost pressure.
Oh,my god.
Pumping station must be on the same power grid as us.
When we lost power to one.we cut into both.
Where's the pumping station ?
Up the hill at the end of chaparral.
Unhook those hoses.
See if there's a working hydrant around back.
Right,chief.
hey,jake.
Stanley.
Thank god.
Chaparral,pumping station,let's go.
Heather.
where's what ?
Heather ? Where's heather ?
Eric.
Yeah ?
I think heather might still be inside.
Nah,they said they cleared the building.
Are you sure ?
Ventilate that areA.
Eric,what are you doing ?
Eric,no !
I wonder what lindsay lohan is doing right now.
Do you think she's still alive ?
I'm trying to find my parents,lisa. I could care less.
Great.
My battery's almost dead.
Excuse me,sorry.
Do you guys sell phone chargers ?
Um,what kind of phone ?
I'll check the back.
Thanks.
Why do you like that freak ?
Why do you like stupid,bulimic actresses ?
Whoa,incoming.
Whoa,sean,no skateboards.
Read the sign.
Hey,you guys got to check it out.
The library's burning,and I didn't even do it.
Is anyone hurt ?
Probably.
Sky,let's go.
Go ahead,I'll catch up.
Come on.
This one says universal,so it should work.
Um,we were going to go check out the fire.
If you want to.
Dale.
Make sure our extinguishers are working,will ya ?
I should stay.
But if you want,I could charge
it and you could come back.
Okay.
Um,if my parents call.
I'll find you.
Thanks.
Come on,if we can open the valve,
we can get water to the fire.
valve shutoff inside
Ashlee ?
hey,ashlee.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go. Come on.
Is anyone here ?
Heather ?
Come oN.
Hey,come on,let's go.
Better do what the angry fireman says.
Let's go.
Come on,this way,let's go !
damn.
it's not going to budge.
Thanks,stanley how do you even know this is it ?
Trust me,it's the manual override.
When the power spiked the solenoid
valves shut down in the off position.
What ?
Dude,you're freaking me out.
How do you even know that ?
How do you not ?
Looks like nobody's touched it in years.
Nobody has.
The motor opens and closes it when the power's on.
No power,no motor.
Yeah,and no water.
Of course,right now what we really need is leverage.
You know what ?
Wait right here.
you can't go in there,ma'am.
My husband's in there !
Stand back,please.
Ashlee,we're going to go out another way.
Are you okay ?
What's wrong ?
nothing,nothing.
We just got to use the other door.
No,no,this way's blocked.
Smoke !
We got to stop it.
Okay,okay,uh,can we use this ?
Yeah.
okay,honey,I need you to get down and
try not to breathe the smoke,all right ?
It's all going to be okay,ashlee.
It's going to be okay.
eric ?
We need another snake.
Ashlee,I need you to crunch down here,
like a game of leap frog,okay ?
Ready ?
this is gonna help protect you.
This'll protect you and help you breathe.
Here.
Here.
Here,breathe using this.
got it !
We got it !
it's running,it's running. We got water.
we're gonna be okay.
Come on,this is our chance. Let's get the hell out of here !
Come on,let's go !
come on.
Somebody has to go in there and help them !
Ma'am,stay back,please.
oh,my god.
Are you hurt ?
No,don't worry about me.
The little girl,she got a lot of smoke.
April,can you take her ?
All right,yeah.
You're gonna be okay,ashlee.
Give me the scope.
I want to see if they have water down at the library.
Listen.
this scope was a christmas present,okay ?
Relax.
Careful.
what do you see ?
It working.
They've got water at the library.
What about the south side fire ?
Looks like the fire's out down by the trailer park.
There's a lot of smoke.
There's another fire.
It's in the east woods.
What ?  !
It's right near eric's house.
What the hell ?
What is it,jake ? What's going on ?
april,april !
Eric,eric,there's another fire.
We'll get to it as soon as we can.
We need help clearing the alley.
Eric.
The fire's spreading.
Eric,it's heading to your house !
What do you want to do ?
It's heading to your house.
There's nothing to do.
We're already spread too thin.
If we don't stop the fire,it could take out main street.
April ?
he's right.
hardware
What are you planning to do ?
Put out a fire.
Do you need a hand ?
I'm good.
If I knew anything,I would tell your mayor.
What do you know ?
Not much.
I got the same message as everyone else.
Do you want my help ?
Get in.
first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to D. C.
Is burn these clothes.
So,what's on your agenda once things settle ?
No agenda.
Just looking forward to living my life.
With dudley do wrong ?
Never gonna happen.
That's really none of your business.
Besides.
you don't know eric the way I do.
Mercifully.
But I know his kind.
Guys like that don't leave wives for girls like us.
"Girls like us" ?
I've been around this particular block before.
Well,I'm sorry to blow your theory,but.
eric is telling his wife about us tonight.
Is he now ?
Yes,he is.
Well,never mind,then.
To the happy couple.
get up a littlehigher by that chimney.
Hey,we got it !
We got it ! Save your house !
What now ?
Water.
Let's use the pool pump.
Filter system.
That's pretty smart,jake.
So where'd you learn to do all this ?
I was a pool guy.
turn it on !
Turn it on !
what ?
Turn on the pump !
Hawkins !
Hawkins !
Come on.
What the hell are you doing ?
Fire knocked out the power.
so I found my own.
got it ?
That was quick thinking.
Yeah,I was a pool guy,too.
How you doing,ashlee ?
I'm okay.
Minor smoke inhalation,but she's gonna be okay.
You saved her life.
Are the other fires still going ?
The south side's under control.
The one near your house ?
I haven't heard. My wife.
hey,where's april ?
You're still here.
Yeah.
Did my parents.
sorry.
It's charged,though.
You going home now ?
Are you gonna stay here all night ?
Don't have anywhere else to go.
The fire moved through the trailer park.
It's all gone.
Oh,dale,I am so sorry.
It's okay.
No,it's not.
Why are you being so calm about it ?
Don't have much of a choice.
How 'bout,scream ?
Cry. Hit something. Break something.
Come on.
Where are you going ?
We'll start with the mayor.
We'll get him to give you a place
to live and some clothes and some money.
I can take care of myself. I'll be okay.
I was just trying to help.
I know.
I know.
here,let me help you with that.
I got it.
No.
I told you.
I'm sorry.
petition for dissolution of marriage
Divorce papers ?
I had them drawn up before the bombs went off.
I didn't want you to see them.
I don'T.
I don't want that anymore.
The divorce,I don't want it.
Well,I can't blame you,april.
Things have been bad between us for a long time.
Not bad.
Just.
not good.
Not now.
Everything's changed,eric.
The world has changed.
Please.
We can think about this.
Just.
not today.
The good silver.
What's the occasion ?
Oh,this set's been passed down for five generations.
Probably seen the light of day maybe
half a dozen times since I've had it.
From now on,every night's a special occasion.
Did you turn off the tv ?
Yeah.
Seemed kind of silly to be staring at a blank screen,
waiting for god-knows-who to tell me god-knows-what.
It did get me thinking,though.
You know that.
that thing you've been running away from ?
It's not out there.
He's upstairs,waiting on dinner.
hi.
I'm glad you're home.
Come on.
Last call,folks !
Closing early tonight !
What are we gonna do about this ?
Watch it at home.
Or at a friend'S.
last.call.
Stanley,go tell everyone.
But I want to watch.
Then pay your tab.
Okay,I'm going.
Check it out,check it out.
It's something else every day.
How are we going to handle all this ?
Same way we did today.
We lost a few buildings but no lives.
And that is,in no small part,thanks to you.
A lot of folks are saying how lucky
jericho is to have you back again.
And what are you telling them ?
Well,I've tried to correct them,but nobody listens to me.
you know what the hardest part
about growing up your son was ?
It's not the politics,or the expectations,it'S.
it's that I always knew you were a good judge
of character,and you thought mine was lousy.
When I left town,I was determined
to prove you wrong,but.
but instead,everywhere I went,
I seemed to prove you right.
Dad.
I wasn't just in san diego.
I don't care.
What ?
I don't care.
If you need to tell me,I'll listen,but.
wherever you went,whatever you did,it changed you.
And a stupid little punk may have left home,
but a pretty decent fellow came back.
I can live with that.
flagged passparts
passparts flagged
daddy,now that the electricity
is back on,can we go to the movies ?
Of course.
And baseball games,and the aquarium,and.
let's just.
start with a movie,okay ?
Okay.
Why were you working outside today ?
Daddy had to fix something.
What was in that big box ?
That was my tools.
Come on,sam,it's bedtime.
Will you come tuck me in,dad ?
Okay.
Did you fix the problem ?
daddy's working on it.
After all these years,wanting to have the whole family around the table.
careful what you wish for.
it's delicious,gail.
Thanks.
Yeah,who knew instant potatoes could taste like anything ?
Well,things will get better after we get real food.
Filet mignon with bleu cheesE.
Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.
Cheeseburger and french fries.
Corned beef and cabbage with that spicy mustard.
Yeah,I could go for a slice of mom's blueberry pie.
Fried chicken with some fresh corn on the cob.
Chocolate cake.
excuse me.they're getting a feed at bailey'S.
Let's turn on the tv.
No,they're the only ones picking it up.
I think it's a satellite feed from D. C.
You're coming,aren't you ?
Yeah,of course.
keep moving it; we lost the picture.
What's going on ?
All right,everybody calm down,all right ?
We'll have it back in a second.

Précédemment dans Jericho
<i>On dirait que l'explosion venait de l'ouest,
peut-être de Denver.</i>
<i>Mais si c'était une attaque, que c'est le chaos dehors.</i>
<i>Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises
personnes sachent que Jericho est toujours là !</i>
<i>La mauvaise nouvelle, c'est qu'il y a eu
une autre explosion à Atlanta.</i>
<i>Alors, on a un plan ?</i>
<i>Je vais parler à April.</i>
<i>Ce soir.</i>
<i>Les secrets d'une petite ville.</i>
<i>Les papiers du divorce.</i>
<i>Je les avais démandés avant que les bombes n'explosent.</i>
<i>Je ne le souhaite plus.</i>
<i>Le train qui n'est jamais arrivé,
il a percuté une voiture.</i>
<i>Il y a une tonne de nourriture
qui attend à l'intérieur.</i>
<i>Si je savais quelque chose je le dirais au Maire.</i>
<i>Allo ?</i>
<i>Bonjour, ici le Secrétaire Adjoint Walsh
du département de la Sécurité Intérieure.</i>
<i>Restez où vous êtes.</i>
<i>N'essayez pas de partir.</i>
<i>Que se passe-t-il ?</i>
<i>Que tout le monde se calme, OK ?</i>
<i>Ça va revenir dans une seconde.</i>
Ce sont les notres ou les leurs ?
Ils sont dirigés vers le haut.
Ça doit être les notres.
Le silo de missile le plus proche est au Wyoming,
à 70 kilomètres d'ici.
Alors c'est ça ?
On est en guerre ?
"Entrez mot de passe"
"Quelle est la cible ?"
"Nous ou eux ?"
"Je suis compromis."
Papa ?
Fais descendre ta mère et Samuel à côté,
et attendez que je sorte.
- Qu'es-tu en-train de...
- Non, chérie, tout de suite !
Si nous envoyons des missiles,
ils ont dû découvrir qui nous attaquait.
Que Dieu bênisse l'Amérique.
Ou ils ont décidé d'attaquer un de nos ennemis habituels.
Ce qui signifie qu'il pourrait y avoir plus de missiles
se dirigeant dans notre direction.
Alors c'est ça la réponse officielle
que nous attendions tous ?
"Fin de transmission."
- Robert, le disjoncteur !
- Ce n'était pas le disjoncteur.
C'était une EMP.
Une charge électromagnétique.
Ça grille tout ce qui contient un circuit électrique.
Tout ce qui contient de l'électronique,
et tous les appareils électriques.
Ça veut dire qu'une autre bombe a explosé ailleurs ?
Mais c'était quoi, bordel ?
Une EMP.
Tout a grillé.
Et les secours arrivent, ou pas ?
Je ne pense pas...

2 SEMAINES PLUS TARD
Oh, mec !
Attends !
C'est quoi ton problème, hein ?
Dale, attends.
Tu fais quoi ?
Il a cassé notre vitrine,
tu l'as vu !
Dale !
Merci beaucoup !
Dale, attends !
Quoi ?
Tu vas bien ?
Ils ont essayé de pénétrer deux fois
dans le magasin cette semaine.
Oh, c'est horrible...
- Tu as un problème ?
- Pas moi !
Dale est mon pote.
N'est-ce pas, Dale ?
Tu ne peux pas bousculer les gens dans la rue
comme ça, compris ?
Si t'as un problème, tu en parles à Jimmy ou Bill.
Tout ce qu'ils feront c'est enregistrer une plainte.
Très bien, alors, viens me voir !
J'ai pas besoin d'aide.
Il doit y avoir un moyen plus simple.
On peut peut-être faire marcher la machine à laver
avec une manivelle ou je ne sais quoi ?
Je reviendrai ce soir.
Où vas-tu, papa ?
Au Poste.
Pourquoi tu tiens tant à jouer au flic ?
Parce que les gens commencent à se plaindre
que personne ne vient les aider.
Vous comprenez ?
Personne.
Parce que le monde que nous connaissions,
n'existe plus désormais.
Donc si nous ne pouvons pas maintenir l'ordre,
nous ne survivrons pas.
Alison, laisse-moi une minute avec ton père.
- Maman, je v...
- De suite !
Mais qu'est-ce que tu cherches à faire, Robert ?
Effrayer nos enfants en parlant de la fin du monde ?
Ils doivent comprendre ce qu'il se passe.
Tu n'étais pas là pendant quatre ans !
C'est moi leur parent ici, d'accord ?
Je déciderai de ce qu'ils ont besoin.
Nous ne pouvons pas montrer ces photos.
Elles pourraient soulever des questions
au sujet de notre famille.
Je ne suis même pas dessus.
Débarasses-t-en, Darcy !
Des gens empiêtent sur mes terres.
Nous n'avons pas les ressources pour contrôler
la ville entière, Carla.
Vous devez surveiller votre propriété vous-même.
Une conduite d'eau a éclaté dans notre rue.
Toute ma pelouse est inondée.
- J'essaie de mettre des hommes là-dessus de suite.
- Où est le Maire Green ?
Il est chez lui, il se remet de sa grippe.
Alors qui gère cette ville ?
Le Maire est toujours en poste, et ces gars font
du mieux qu'ils peuvent, avec un personnel limité.
Qui donc êtes-vous ?
C'est un volontaire et un adjoint.
Maintenant calmez-vous, et on s'occupera de vous.
Mais vous devez être patients.
S'il vous plaît.
Comment va ton frère ?
Eric ne s'exprime pas beaucoup.
Il passe beaucoup de temps au boulot,
pour s'assurer que la ville reste en état.
Vraiment ?
C'est curieux...
Je pensais qu'il passait un peu plus de temps
avec sa femme.
Maintenant qu'ils ont perdu leur maison et tout le reste.
Ils ont l'air plutôt heureux ensemble.
Mitchell, attends !
Tu es ravissante, Mary.
Tu ne vas pas encore remettre ça, Mitch.
Tu n'es pas le bienvenu ici.
Allez, avec tout ce qu'il s'est passé,
je cherche juste une bière fraîche.
Nous n'avons rien servi de frais depuis longtemps.
Très bien, donne moi de ce que tu as.
Ou je me sers moi-même.
Fais attention à ce que tu dis.
Tout le monde pensait que tu y étais resté.
Mais je savais que tu trouverais un moyen d'en réchapper.
Allez, ne réagis pas comme ça.
Si quelqu'un devait être rancunier,
ce serait moi, n'est-ce pas ?
Je veux dire, tu m'as laissé régler les problèmes
alors que tu quittais la ville.
Tu sais quoi, tu as raison.
Ne me force pas à te botter le cul à nouveau.
Hé !
Tout va bien ?
Tu voyages avec ton propre garde du corps maintenant ?
Ce n'est sans doute pas une mauvaise idée.
- Quel est le problème ici ?
- Oh, pas de problème.
Juste deux vieux amis qui se retrouvent.
Peut-être que vous devriez le faire ailleurs.
Et à un autre moment.
On se voit bientôt.
- Salut, maman.
- Bonjour !
Que fais-tu à la maison ?
J'ai juste besoin d'un autre carnet d'enregistrement.
Nous avons reçu plus de plaintes ces derniers jours,
que nous en avons normalement en un mois.
Jake et moi allons aller au ranch nourrir les chevaux
dans pas longtemps.
Si tu veux te joindre à nous,
peut-être que nous pourrions parler.
Je suis désolé, je ne peux pas.
Avec papa au lit, je fais mon possible pour
que les choses n'empirent pas.
Et en ce qui concerne notre famille ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est censé vouloir dire ?
Comment allez-vous, toi et April ?
Pourquoi, a-t-elle dit quelque chose ?
Eric...
Comment va Johnston ?
J'aimerais avoir de meilleures nouvelles.
Sa fièvre empire.
J'essaierai de trouver des antibiotiques plus forts
au Centre Médical, mais nous allons bientôt en manquer.
Mon Dieu, si je pouvais juste lui faire entendre raison.
- Tu restes ?
- Ne t'occupe pas de moi, m'man !
Il y a une boîte de barres protéinées à la station.
J'en prendrai quelques unes.
D'accord.
Si tu attends dix minutes, peut-être qu'on
pourrait y aller ensemble ?
Je dois y aller.
Il y a une importante réunion.
Ta place est là-bas.
On parlera ce soir.
Peut-être qu'on devrait installer
un nouveau démarreur.
Personne ne peut trouver un démarreur
qui fonctionne.
Oncle Sam !
Qu'est-ce qui nous vaut ce plaisir ?
Pourriez-vous éviter de m'appeler comme ça ?
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a dit ?
Elle a dit qu'elle aimait
vos chaussures.
Merci.
J'ai une proposition...
L'hôtel que j'occupais est fermé, et puisque vous
devez au gouvernement plus de 180.000 $...
- Personne n'a entendu parler du
gouvernement depuis des semaines.
- Considérez que je représente le gouvernement.
- Très bien, alors je vais continuer
à vous appeler Oncle Sam.
Jolie montre.
C'est une Rolex.
Vous avez l'heure?
Il est...
Elle s'est arrêtée apres l'impulsion
comme toutes les autres.
Et bien je paierai quand
elle refonctionnera.
Vous êtes un idiot !
J'essaie de vous donner une chance
de protéger vos intérêts.
Vous êtes trop aimable.
Vous me laissez rester ici, et je déduis ma chambre
et ma pension de ce que vous devez.
Très bien, très bien, pourquoi pas.
J'ai besoin d'aide aux champs, et vous aiderez
Bonnie pour la cuisine et le ménage.
Ok, peut-etre n'avez-vous pas
compris la nature de ce contrat,
je ne m'occupe pas des tâches ménagères.
Des cafards ?
- Il n'y a pas de cafard ici.
- Il vient de se poser sur moi !
Ils sont probablement attirés par
toutes ces merdes de poulets !
Stanley, qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
C'est quoi ça ?
Le casier de Mitchell Cafferty.
Cambriolages, agressions,
trafic d'armes...
Ouais.
Mitch n'est pas la personne la plus
fréquentable de Jericho.
Qu'est-ce que vous savez sur lui ?
Il s'est fait oublié depuis un moment.
Il vis aux abords de la ville,
dans une sorte de camp avec d'autres gars.
- Comme un camp de survie ?
- Je suppose.
Pourquoi êtes-vous tant intéressé ?
Il était au Bailey ce matin,
il a eu des mots avec votre frère,
on dirait qu'il y une longue histoire
derrière tout ça.
Qu'est-ce que Jake a fait ?
Il a gardé son calme, il n'a pas répondu.
Le mieux à faire est de
le laisser tranquille,
comme vous avez dit,
c'est une longue histoire.
Il y a une chose qui n'a pas changé...
Tout ça.
Tu te souviens quand tu es
monté à cheval pour la première fois ?
On aurait dit un poisson dans l'eau.
Si tu avais passé plus de temps avec ton oncle Dennis et
un peu moins avec ton père, tu aurais été un sacré cavalier.
Parle-moi,
j'en ai marre d'entendre ma voix.
Tu vas bien ?
Oui, juste fatigué.
Je vais chercher de l'eau.
Maman !
Reste à terre !
Qui sont ces types ?
Je n'arrive pas à croire
que rien ne soit cassé.
Je vais vous chercher de l'aspirine,
pour la douleur et éviter que ça enfle.
Je suis désolée de ne pouvoir vous
offrir quelque chose de plus fort.
C'est bon chérie,
je n'ai besoin de rien d'autre.
Ne discute pas avec elle, Gail,
ordres du médecin !
Bande d'enfoirés.
Jake ?
Où vas tu ?
- Trouver Mitch.
- Et après?
Je ne sais pas encore.
Attends Jake, tu n'es pas sûr
qu'il soit derrière...
- C'était lui !
Tu as dis toi-même que tu n'as pas
très bien vu !
Ecoute...
Il n'y a rien que j'aimerais plus que de mettre la main
sur ceux qui ont fait ça, mais c'est pas comme ça qu'on agit !
La dernière fois que tu t'es battu avec Mitch Cafferty,
tu as quitté la ville et un homme est mort.
- Je ne suis plus le même homme.
- Ah ouais ?
Je préfère être sûr que tu
vas rester comme ça.
- Ecoute, si je ne m'en occupe pas, il reviendra.
On doit le faire, tu le sais.
Si cette famille commence à enfreindre la loi,
qui va la faire respecter ?
Gracy, il te reste des pesticides ?
Tout ce qu'il me reste est juste là,
sur cette étagère.
Merci mon Dieu, je vais avoir besoin de tout
ce que tu as pour traiter mon maïs.
Est-ce que quelqu'un peut
encore manger ce maïs?
Avec cette pluie qui est tombée?
Non, c'est bon, leurs enveloppes
les ont protégés de la pluie.
Il était déjà mûr,
les épis ne peuvent pas être atteints.
Tu es sûr de ça ?
Gracie, tu penses que je laisserais ma soeur
en manger si il y avait le moindre danger ?
Tu penses que je le ferais ?
Après ce que j'ai subi ?
Je t'en donnerai 20 bottes
contre ces pesticides.
Et bien, je pensais qu'on pourrait
partager la récolte, moitié-moitié.
La moitié ?
T'es folle ?
Comment vas-tu vendre ton maïs ?
Donne-le moi, je le vendrai ici,
et on partage les bénéfices.
Les fermes de Richmond appartiennent
au ministère de l'économie,
estimez-vous heureuse qu'on ne
prenne pas ce dont on a besoin.
J'aimerais bien voir ça.
C'est bon, allons-y.
<i>Salut Jimmy.</i>
<i>Eric, quoi de neuf ?</i>
Salut Mary.
Où étais-tu passé ?
On pense que Mitch Cafferty et sa bande
ont volé des chevaux.
Je sais qu'ils sont passés ici, j'ai pensé que peut-être
tu aurais entendu quelque chose.
Quoique vous sachiez Mary,
ça peut nous aider.
Il y avait un homme ici, cet après midi,
je l'ai entendu dire qu'il avait acheté un cheval
à des hommes près du terrain d'aviation.
Le terrain d'aviation ?
D'accord.
Merci.
Merci.
Eric.
La dernière fois que je t'ai vu,
tu étais sur le point de tout dire à ta femme.
Cette pensée me faisait tenir le coup.
Ça fait deux semaines maintenant.
Je ne sais pas...
à quoi tu penses, si tu vas bien ?
Je ne sais pas si je vais bien, Mary.
Je sais que ce n'est pas ce que je voulais.
Mary, je pense à toi chaque minute
de chaque jour,
Mary, je me réveille le matin
et j'aimerais tant que tu sois là.
Je sais que...
Je sais que je suis toujours marié et que j'ai une femme
et que je lui dois...
quelque chose.
Je ne sais pas quoi dire Mary,
j'aurais aimé le faire
mais je ne l'ai pas fait.
Ça ressemble à un hôpital ici.
Je pensais en avoir encore pour 20 ans
avant d'en arriver là !
J'ai chaud !
Je parie que tu ne pensais pas voir la maison
remplie d'enfants non plus.
Je m'inquiète pour Jake.
Moi aussi.
Je ne pense pas que j'oublierai
la nuit où j'ai reçu cet appel...
J'y suis allé, Mitch Cafferty était menotté,
l'autre gamin couvert de sang, et j'ai pensé que...
qu'un de ces types aurait pu être Jake.
- Bonjour Stanley.
- Bonjour.
Désolé de vous déranger Mme Greene,
M. le Maire, mais...
je dois vous parler.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Mes maïs sont infestés de vers,
et, je sais que c'est beaucoup demander, mais j'espérais
que vous auriez des pesticides dans votre ranch,
aucun autre fermier ne veut s'en séparer.
Je suis désolé Stanley,
as-tu essayé auprès de Gracie?
Ouais... elle ne m'en donnera pas.
Ecoutez, j'ai besoin de tuer ces insectes, sinon je vais
devoir récolter trop tôt, ou tout sera détruit.
Est-ce qu'elle réalise que vous avez
la plus grosse ferme de Jericho ?
Je veux dire, si on perd ces récoltes,
on va tous mourir de faim !
Nous devons nous réunir au plus vite,
et nous déciderons comment rationner tout ça.
Attendez une minute.
C'est mon maïs.
Bien sûr Stanley,
c'est juste qu'on a besoin que tu le partages,
nous sommes livrés à nous-même,
et la ville n'a presque plus de nourriture.
Je veux bien faire mon boulot, M. le Maire,
mais je ne vais pas donner ma récolte.
Stanley, il y en aura suffisamment
pour vous et Bonnie,
suffisamment pour tout le monde.
Pour 5.000 personnes plus le bétail
pendant Dieu sait combien de temps?
Je ne suis pas le seul fermier de cette ville,
pourquoi suis-je le seul visé ?
Stanley, personne n'a été visé.
On dirait pas, Monsieur. Tout le monde veut ma récolte,
le gouvernement, Gracie et maintenant vous !
Stanley, nous essayons juste de...
Avec tout mon respect,
je vais m'en occuper moi-même.
Stanley, reviens et assieds-toi chéri.
Stanley, reviens ici maintenant !
Salut, toi.
Jake.
Dale, qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je suis désolé.
Je savais pas.
- Tu savais pas quoi ?
- Jake !
Jake ?
Toi, tu recules.
Fous le camp d'ici, Dale.
Non.
Reste ici, prends ça pour un apprentissage.
Tu as dépassé les bornes.
Pardon ?
Tu m'as bien entendu.
En venant dans notre ferme.
J'ai dépassé les bornes ?
On m'a mis en tôle...
le soir ou tu as été libéré sous caution.
Mon meilleur pote...
s'est à moitié fait exploser la tête.
Je t'avais prévenu que je ne voulais voler personne.
Allez, arrête de faire le saint.
Tu es revenu pour... te poser ?
Fonder une famille, faire le paysan ?
J'avais pas prévu de rester.
Bien sûr.
Mais tu veux aller où ?
Les bagnoles marchent plus.
On n'a bientôt plus de chevaux.
Si toi...
ou n'importe qui d'autre s'approche
à nouveau de ma famille, je te tuerai.
Voilà, ça c'est le Jake que je connais.
Bon, maintenant lève-toi.
Je t'emmène voir John.
Arrêtez !
Shérif !
Pas un geste.
Où est Mitchell ?
Je sais pas.
Je te connais Sean... tu mens.
Dale?
Ça va être ton tour.
Comment on peut gérer ça ?
On a rien contre eux, le juge le plus proche est au tribunal
du Comté, en admettant qu'il y en ait encore un.
Le problème, ce sont ces gamins ?
Ou Mitchell Cafferty ?
Il a volé les chevaux de ma mère,
et il aurait pu la faire tuer.
Il y avait des histoires entre vous déjà bien avant, Jake.
J'ai lu son dossier.
Il va nous poser des problèmes, non ?
Maintenant qu'on a perdu le Shérif et la moitié de ses Adjoints,
Mitchell et ses gars vont pouvoir s'attaquer à la ville.
On doit les arrêter maintenant.
Bon, si on veut des renseignements,
on doit les séparer.
D'accord, j'emmène Sean dans le couloir.
Non.
Lui, je m'en occupe.
Debout, on va faire un tour.
Va te faire foutre, j'ai pas à...
En avant.
<i>On a volé des pesticides chez Gracie.</i>
Tu sais quelque chose ?
Non. En fait, j'y suis allé pour en acheter, mais...
Mais quoi ?
D'accord, c'est quoi le problème ?
A quoi tu joues ?
Gracie est venue au poste.
Elle jurait par tous les Dieux.
Elle t'accuse de les avoir volés.
Elle m'accuse de les avoir volés ?
Ça te dérange si je jette un coup d'oeil ?
Oui, ça me dérange, Bill.
C'est complètement dingue !
Que se passe-t-il ?
J'en sais rien.
Une de mes meilleurs amis m'accuse
d'avoir volé des pesticides.
Je vais voir dans la grange.
Je t'ai pas dit que tu pouvais y aller.
Fais gaffe.
C'est bon. Laisse-le faire ce qu'il veut.
Très bien, fouille la grange.
Fouille toute la baraque si tu veux !
Je sais pas comment tu t'es retrouvé avec Mitchell,
mais tu dois rester loin de lui.
Je suis sérieux.
Tu risques de finir en tôle, ou bien pire.
Comment tu t'es retrouvé avec lui ?
J'étais stupide...
et je recherchais les ennuis.
Tu recherches les ennuis ?
Dale.
Pourquoi ils te gardent ici ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
On faisait que parler.
Sans avocat, tu n'as pas le droit.
- Je suis pas flic.
- De toute façon, je viens payer sa caution.
Je sais que plus rien ne marche,
mais tu dois la prendre.
Va t'en.
Tu me laisses partir ?
Ouais.
J'essayais juste de te raisonner un peu.
Crois-moi, tu n'as pas intérêt à suivre cette voie.
Je pense savoir où est Mitchell.
Je vous y amènerai.
Papa ?
Papa ?
Papa ?
Allez, sors d'ici.
Toutes ces villes ont disparu ?
A ton avis ?
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Je n'en suis pas sûr.
D'accord.
Ce sont toutes les villes dont j'ai entendu parler
grâce à la radio, ou par le satellite, avant l'EMP.
Pourquoi ton portable n'a pas grillé
comme tout le reste ?
Il est protégé.
Il est conçu pour résister à une EMP.
C'est...
C'est du matériel fourni par le Gouvernement, chérie.
T'es une sorte d'espion ?
C'est pour ça qu'on est venu ici.
Tu savais que ça allait arriver.
Et pourquoi tu as un flingue ?
A quoi il sert ?
A tirer.
Et je pense qu'il serait temps que tu apprennes.
Tu vois, au train où vont les choses...
tu devras peut-être te défendre un jour.
Tu comprends ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
On s'expliquait.
D'accord ?
C'est bon.
T'es sûr ?
Parce qu'on pourrait vérifier les champs aussi,
rangée par rangée.
On a eu une plainte.
Et tout ce que tu trouves à faire maintenant,
c'est accuser quelqu'un ?
- Stanley.
- Non.
Que fais-tu de ma parole, Bill ?
Je fais juste mon boulot, mec.
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?</i>
Je vais brûler les champs.
T'as complètement perdu la tête.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
Je vais bruler les champs,
juste les parties infestées.
Mon Dieu, Stanley.
Tu n'as pas besoin de faire ça.
Ecoute, je vois pas ce que je peux faire d'autre.
C'est moi qui ai les pesticides.
De quoi tu parles ?
J'ai payé des gamins pour les voler chez Gracie.
On a juste à retourner en ville et à les récupérer.
Tu as volé les pesticides ?
Quoi, tu ne m'as pas écouté ?
J'ai payé quelqu'un pour les voler.
Je leur ai donné ma montre en diamant.
J'arrive pas à croire qu'on en soit arrivé là.
On n'a pas vraiment le choix, Stanley.
C'est chacun pour soi maintenant.
- Il dort enfin.
- Super.
Comment tu te sens ?
Je m'accroche.
Je regrette de ne pas pouvoir faire plus pour lui.
C'est un homme têtu.
La pomme ne tombe jamais très loin de l'arbre.
Ce n'est certainement pas le cas pour Jake.
Je ne sais pas, vu que j'ai toujours
considéré qu'Eric était entêté.
Il est difficile à atteindre, alors ?
Et bien, il a dû faire face à beaucoup de choses.
Depuis que les missiles...
sans parler de nos nouvelles conditions de vie.
Oui.
Ça a commencé bien avant tout ça.
J'ai aussi vécu ça.
Essayer de recoller les morceaux...
n'est jamais facile.
Mais quelqu'un doit faire le premier pas.
Alors si tu veux te battre pour y arriver,
commence à te battre.
Tu dois mieux choisir les personnes avec qui tu traînes.
Je ne traîne pas avec ces gars.
J'avais juste besoin que Sean et Mitch m'aident
à déplacer certains trucs, c'est tout.
Je n'étais pas au courant pour les chevaux.
Et tu étais au courant de quoi alors, Dale ?
Hé, tu n'aurais jamais dû essayer de les protéger.
Ce n'est pas ce que j'ai fait.
J'essayais de protéger Gracie.
Comment ça ?
Un train plein de nourriture a déraillé.
C'est comme ça que Gracie s'approvisionnait.
Je voulais que personne ne le sache.
Tout est là-dedans.
Quoi ?
Cet endroit était plein à craquer, jusqu'au plafond.
C'est pas bien difficile de savoir qui a tout pris.
Gracie.
Dégage de mon magasin.
Je sais que tu m'as volé.
Non, ce n'était pas moi, Gracie.
Je te jure que ce n'était pas moi.
Gracie, on se connaît depuis combien de temps ?
Depuis toujours, non ?
On doit avoir confiance l'un dans l'autre.
Bon, laisse-moi te montrer.
Suis-moi.
Tu vois, Gracie, tout est là.
Personne n'a rien volé à personne, d'accord ?
C'était juste un malentendu.
Tu as une idée où il aurait pu aller ?
Non, aucune.
Reste ici.
Arrête-toi immédiatement, Mitchell !
Pose ton arme.
Pose ton arme !
Et maintenant les mains sur la tête.
Où est la nourriture ?
<i>Jake !</i>
<i>Arrête-toi.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Arrête-toi !</i>
Où est la nourriture ?
Arrête !
Qu'est ce qu'on fait de lui ?
Pour l'instant on l'enferme.
On peut peut-être envoyer quelqu'un à Fielding
pour voir si le tribunal fonctionne toujours.
Ses amis ne vont pas en rester là.
Je peux gérer ça.
Oui, comme tu as bien géré
la situation à la grange.
- J'aurais dû le tuer.
- Arrête, Jake.
Tu n'es plus le même homme maintenant.
Et ces deux là ?
Je pense qu'on pourrait laisser partir Dale,
mais Sean a aidé à voler les chevaux.
Ce n'est encore qu'un enfant.
Un enfant qui aurait pû te faire tuer, maman.
Et bien, ça ne change rien, Eric,
car je ne porterai pas plainte.
Cette cellule est bien trop petite pour pouvoir y mettre
toutes les personnes qui ont déjà commis une erreur.
Tu proposes quoi ?
La réhabilitation.
Bon.
Tiens-le bien.
Tous les doigts pliés.
Détends-toi.
Très bien.
C'est bien.
Respire.
Garde tes jambes comme ça.
Ecarte les un peu plus.
Très bien.
Maintenant, replie les genoux, vise.
Essaie de garder les yeux ouverts.
Appuie.
Très bien. Bon boulot. Bon boulot.
Très bien.
C'est du très bon boulot.
Tu aimes ça ?
Tu es sûr que ça va marcher ?
En théorie, oui.
Tu n'as jamais fait ça auparavant ?
Nan.
Et bien, ne t'en mets pas sur les chaussures.
Sérieusement, éloigne toi de moi.
Oh mon Dieu,
si seulement j'étais croyante.
Stanley.
Tu as dit que tu devais récolter aujourd'hui.
On est venu te donner un coup de main,
si tu veux bien.
Merci.
Maman.
Et bien, bonjour.
Je suis vraiment désolé, Mme Green.
Je suis désolé pour tout.
D'accord, et bien rendez-vous utile.
Pas la peine d'y penser.
Oncle Sam.
Vous avez déjà dormi dans une grange ?
Vous savez, c'est pas comme dans les films.
L'odeur peut devenir très forte là-dedans, avec les
cochons et les chèvres qui se frottent contre vous.
Vous me faites marcher.
Croyez-moi.
Tiens, c'est pour toi.
J'ai perdu la tête, Stanley.
Je suis désolé.
Merci.
Tu sais ce que tu fais ?
Pas la moindre idée.
Merci pour ton aide.
C'est aussi ta maison.
C'est vrai.
C'est un homme bon ou mauvais ?
Chérie, ça marche pas comme ça.
C'est plutôt cool, hein ?
Oui.
Surtout si on aime le maïs.
Dur travail, hein ?
Oui.
Je me disais qu'en partant d'ici, on pourrait peut-être...
J'allais dire faire une balade, mais on sera trop crevé...
April, arrête s'il te plaît, d'accord ?
Quoi ?
Ça.
Ce que tu es en train de faire.
Ca n'arrange rien.
J'essaie simplement de te parler, d'attirer
ton regard, quelque chose quoi.
Il y a trois semaines tu demandais le divorce.
Il y a trois semaines on ne vivait pas sur la même planète.
Les choses ont changé.
Laisse tomber.
April, attends.
Le trajet jusqu'à la maison...
On pourrait commencer par ça,
pour voir comment on se sent.
"J'emmerde cette ville"
"Jake Green 92"
Jake.
Tu es prêt pour ça ?
Tu sais qu'il va venir me chercher.
Et ensuite il en aura après toi.
Cette fois, pas moyen de s'échapper, Jake.

Précédemment dans Jericho
<i>On dirait que l'explosion venait de l'ouest,
peut-être de Denver.</i>
<i>Mais si c'était une attaque, que c'est le chaos dehors.</i>
<i>Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises
personnes sachent que Jericho est toujours là !</i>
<i>La mauvaise nouvelle, c'est qu'il y a eu
une autre explosion à Atlanta.</i>
<i>Alors, on a un plan ?</i>
<i>Je vais parler à April.</i>
<i>Ce soir.</i>
<i>Les secrets d'une petite ville.</i>
<i>Les papiers du divorce.</i>
<i>Je les avais démandés avant que les bombes n'explosent.</i>
<i>Je ne le souhaite plus.</i>
<i>Le train qui n'est jamais arrivé,
il a percuté une voiture.</i>
<i>Il y a une tonne de nourriture
qui attend à l'intérieur.</i>
<i>Si je savais quelque chose je le dirais au Maire.</i>
<i>Allo ?</i>
<i>Bonjour, ici le Secrétaire Adjoint Walsh
du département de la Sécurité Intérieure.</i>
<i>Restez où vous êtes.</i>
<i>N'essayez pas de partir.</i>
<i>Que se passe-t-il ?</i>
<i>Que tout le monde se calme, OK ?</i>
<i>Ça va revenir dans une seconde.</i>
Ce sont les notres ou les leurs ?
Ils sont dirigés vers le haut.
Ça doit être les notres.
Le silo de missile le plus proche est au Wyoming,
à 70 kilomètres d'ici.
Alors c'est ça ?
On est en guerre ?
"Entrez mot de passe"
"Quelle est la cible ?"
"Nous ou eux ?"
"Je suis compromis."
Papa ?
Fais descendre ta mère et Samuel à côté,
et attendez que je sorte.
- Qu'es-tu en-train de...
- Non, chérie, tout de suite !
Si nous envoyons des missiles,
ils ont dû découvrir qui nous attaquait.
Que Dieu bênisse l'Amérique.
Ou ils ont décidé d'attaquer un de nos ennemis habituels.
Ce qui signifie qu'il pourrait y avoir plus de missiles
se dirigeant dans notre direction.
Alors c'est ça la réponse officielle
que nous attendions tous ?
"Fin de transmission."
- Robert, le disjoncteur !
- Ce n'était pas le disjoncteur.
C'était une EMP.
Une charge électromagnétique.
Ça grille tout ce qui contient un circuit électrique.
Tout ce qui contient de l'électronique,
et tous les appareils électriques.
Ça veut dire qu'une autre bombe a explosé ailleurs ?
Mais c'était quoi, bordel ?
Une EMP.
Tout a grillé.
Et les secours arrivent, ou pas ?
Je ne pense pas...

2 SEMAINES PLUS TARD
Oh, mec !
Attends !
C'est quoi ton problème, hein ?
Dale, attends.
Tu fais quoi ?
Il a cassé notre vitrine,
tu l'as vu !
Dale !
Merci beaucoup !
Dale, attends !
Quoi ?
Tu vas bien ?
Ils ont essayé de pénétrer deux fois
dans le magasin cette semaine.
Oh, c'est horrible...
- Tu as un problème ?
- Pas moi !
Dale est mon pote.
N'est-ce pas, Dale ?
Tu ne peux pas bousculer les gens dans la rue
comme ça, compris ?
Si t'as un problème, tu en parles à Jimmy ou Bill.
Tout ce qu'ils feront c'est enregistrer une plainte.
Très bien, alors, viens me voir !
J'ai pas besoin d'aide.
Il doit y avoir un moyen plus simple.
On peut peut-être faire marcher la machine à laver
avec une manivelle ou je ne sais quoi ?
Je reviendrai ce soir.
Où vas-tu, papa ?
Au Poste.
Pourquoi tu tiens tant à jouer au flic ?
Parce que les gens commencent à se plaindre
que personne ne vient les aider.
Vous comprenez ?
Personne.
Parce que le monde que nous connaissions,
n'existe plus désormais.
Donc si nous ne pouvons pas maintenir l'ordre,
nous ne survivrons pas.
Alison, laisse-moi une minute avec ton père.
- Maman, je v...
- De suite !
Mais qu'est-ce que tu cherches à faire, Robert ?
Effrayer nos enfants en parlant de la fin du monde ?
Ils doivent comprendre ce qu'il se passe.
Tu n'étais pas là pendant quatre ans !
C'est moi leur parent ici, d'accord ?
Je déciderai de ce qu'ils ont besoin.
Nous ne pouvons pas montrer ces photos.
Elles pourraient soulever des questions
au sujet de notre famille.
Je ne suis même pas dessus.
Débarasses-t-en, Darcy !
Des gens empiêtent sur mes terres.
Nous n'avons pas les ressources pour contrôler
la ville entière, Carla.
Vous devez surveiller votre propriété vous-même.
Une conduite d'eau a éclaté dans notre rue.
Toute ma pelouse est inondée.
- J'essaie de mettre des hommes là-dessus de suite.
- Où est le Maire Green ?
Il est chez lui, il se remet de sa grippe.
Alors qui gère cette ville ?
Le Maire est toujours en poste, et ces gars font
du mieux qu'ils peuvent, avec un personnel limité.
Qui donc êtes-vous ?
C'est un volontaire et un adjoint.
Maintenant calmez-vous, et on s'occupera de vous.
Mais vous devez être patients.
S'il vous plaît.
Comment va ton frère ?
Eric ne s'exprime pas beaucoup.
Il passe beaucoup de temps au boulot,
pour s'assurer que la ville reste en état.
Vraiment ?
C'est curieux...
Je pensais qu'il passait un peu plus de temps
avec sa femme.
Maintenant qu'ils ont perdu leur maison et tout le reste.
Ils ont l'air plutôt heureux ensemble.
Mitchell, attends !
Tu es ravissante, Mary.
Tu ne vas pas encore remettre ça, Mitch.
Tu n'es pas le bienvenu ici.
Allez, avec tout ce qu'il s'est passé,
je cherche juste une bière fraîche.
Nous n'avons rien servi de frais depuis longtemps.
Très bien, donne moi de ce que tu as.
Ou je me sers moi-même.
Fais attention à ce que tu dis.
Tout le monde pensait que tu y étais resté.
Mais je savais que tu trouverais un moyen d'en réchapper.
Allez, ne réagis pas comme ça.
Si quelqu'un devait être rancunier,
ce serait moi, n'est-ce pas ?
Je veux dire, tu m'as laissé régler les problèmes
alors que tu quittais la ville.
Tu sais quoi, tu as raison.
Ne me force pas à te botter le cul à nouveau.
Hé !
Tout va bien ?
Tu voyages avec ton propre garde du corps maintenant ?
Ce n'est sans doute pas une mauvaise idée.
- Quel est le problème ici ?
- Oh, pas de problème.
Juste deux vieux amis qui se retrouvent.
Peut-être que vous devriez le faire ailleurs.
Et à un autre moment.
On se voit bientôt.
- Salut, maman.
- Bonjour !
Que fais-tu à la maison ?
J'ai juste besoin d'un autre carnet d'enregistrement.
Nous avons reçu plus de plaintes ces derniers jours,
que nous en avons normalement en un mois.
Jake et moi allons aller au ranch nourrir les chevaux
dans pas longtemps.
Si tu veux te joindre à nous,
peut-être que nous pourrions parler.
Je suis désolé, je ne peux pas.
Avec papa au lit, je fais mon possible pour
que les choses n'empirent pas.
Et en ce qui concerne notre famille ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est censé vouloir dire ?
Comment allez-vous, toi et April ?
Pourquoi, a-t-elle dit quelque chose ?
Eric...
Comment va Johnston ?
J'aimerais avoir de meilleures nouvelles.
Sa fièvre empire.
J'essaierai de trouver des antibiotiques plus forts
au Centre Médical, mais nous allons bientôt en manquer.
Mon Dieu, si je pouvais juste lui faire entendre raison.
- Tu restes ?
- Ne t'occupe pas de moi, m'man !
Il y a une boîte de barres protéinées à la station.
J'en prendrai quelques unes.
D'accord.
Si tu attends dix minutes, peut-être qu'on
pourrait y aller ensemble ?
Je dois y aller.
Il y a une importante réunion.
Ta place est là-bas.
On parlera ce soir.
Peut-être qu'on devrait installer
un nouveau démarreur.
Personne ne peut trouver un démarreur
qui fonctionne.
Oncle Sam !
Qu'est-ce qui nous vaut ce plaisir ?
Pourriez-vous éviter de m'appeler comme ça ?
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a dit ?
Elle a dit qu'elle aimait
vos chaussures.
Merci.
J'ai une proposition...
L'hôtel que j'occupais est fermé, et puisque vous
devez au gouvernement plus de 180.000 $...
- Personne n'a entendu parler du
gouvernement depuis des semaines.
- Considérez que je représente le gouvernement.
- Très bien, alors je vais continuer
à vous appeler Oncle Sam.
Jolie montre.
C'est une Rolex.
Vous avez l'heure?
Il est...
Elle s'est arrêtée apres l'impulsion
comme toutes les autres.
Et bien je paierai quand
elle refonctionnera.
Vous êtes un idiot !
J'essaie de vous donner une chance
de protéger vos intérêts.
Vous êtes trop aimable.
Vous me laissez rester ici, et je déduis ma chambre
et ma pension de ce que vous devez.
Très bien, très bien, pourquoi pas.
J'ai besoin d'aide aux champs, et vous aiderez
Bonnie pour la cuisine et le ménage.
Ok, peut-etre n'avez-vous pas
compris la nature de ce contrat,
je ne m'occupe pas des tâches ménagères.
Des cafards ?
- Il n'y a pas de cafard ici.
- Il vient de se poser sur moi !
Ils sont probablement attirés par
toutes ces merdes de poulets !
Stanley, qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
C'est quoi ça ?
Le casier de Mitchell Cafferty.
Cambriolages, agressions,
trafic d'armes...
Ouais.
Mitch n'est pas la personne la plus
fréquentable de Jericho.
Qu'est-ce que vous savez sur lui ?
Il s'est fait oublié depuis un moment.
Il vis aux abords de la ville,
dans une sorte de camp avec d'autres gars.
- Comme un camp de survie ?
- Je suppose.
Pourquoi êtes-vous tant intéressé ?
Il était au Bailey ce matin,
il a eu des mots avec votre frère,
on dirait qu'il y une longue histoire
derrière tout ça.
Qu'est-ce que Jake a fait ?
Il a gardé son calme, il n'a pas répondu.
Le mieux à faire est de
le laisser tranquille,
comme vous avez dit,
c'est une longue histoire.
Il y a une chose qui n'a pas changé...
Tout ça.
Tu te souviens quand tu es
monté à cheval pour la première fois ?
On aurait dit un poisson dans l'eau.
Si tu avais passé plus de temps avec ton oncle Dennis et
un peu moins avec ton père, tu aurais été un sacré cavalier.
Parle-moi,
j'en ai marre d'entendre ma voix.
Tu vas bien ?
Oui, juste fatigué.
Je vais chercher de l'eau.
Maman !
Reste à terre !
Qui sont ces types ?
Je n'arrive pas à croire
que rien ne soit cassé.
Je vais vous chercher de l'aspirine,
pour la douleur et éviter que ça enfle.
Je suis désolée de ne pouvoir vous
offrir quelque chose de plus fort.
C'est bon chérie,
je n'ai besoin de rien d'autre.
Ne discute pas avec elle, Gail,
ordres du médecin !
Bande d'enfoirés.
Jake ?
Où vas tu ?
- Trouver Mitch.
- Et après?
Je ne sais pas encore.
Attends Jake, tu n'es pas sûr
qu'il soit derrière...
- C'était lui !
Tu as dis toi-même que tu n'as pas
très bien vu !
Ecoute...
Il n'y a rien que j'aimerais plus que de mettre la main
sur ceux qui ont fait ça, mais c'est pas comme ça qu'on agit !
La dernière fois que tu t'es battu avec Mitch Cafferty,
tu as quitté la ville et un homme est mort.
- Je ne suis plus le même homme.
- Ah ouais ?
Je préfère être sûr que tu
vas rester comme ça.
- Ecoute, si je ne m'en occupe pas, il reviendra.
On doit le faire, tu le sais.
Si cette famille commence à enfreindre la loi,
qui va la faire respecter ?
Gracy, il te reste des pesticides ?
Tout ce qu'il me reste est juste là,
sur cette étagère.
Merci mon Dieu, je vais avoir besoin de tout
ce que tu as pour traiter mon maïs.
Est-ce que quelqu'un peut
encore manger ce maïs?
Avec cette pluie qui est tombée?
Non, c'est bon, leurs enveloppes
les ont protégés de la pluie.
Il était déjà mûr,
les épis ne peuvent pas être atteints.
Tu es sûr de ça ?
Gracie, tu penses que je laisserais ma soeur
en manger si il y avait le moindre danger ?
Tu penses que je le ferais ?
Après ce que j'ai subi ?
Je t'en donnerai 20 bottes
contre ces pesticides.
Et bien, je pensais qu'on pourrait
partager la récolte, moitié-moitié.
La moitié ?
T'es folle ?
Comment vas-tu vendre ton maïs ?
Donne-le moi, je le vendrai ici,
et on partage les bénéfices.
Les fermes de Richmond appartiennent
au ministère de l'économie,
estimez-vous heureuse qu'on ne
prenne pas ce dont on a besoin.
J'aimerais bien voir ça.
C'est bon, allons-y.
<i>Salut Jimmy.</i>
<i>Eric, quoi de neuf ?</i>
Salut Mary.
Où étais-tu passé ?
On pense que Mitch Cafferty et sa bande
ont volé des chevaux.
Je sais qu'ils sont passés ici, j'ai pensé que peut-être
tu aurais entendu quelque chose.
Quoique vous sachiez Mary,
ça peut nous aider.
Il y avait un homme ici, cet après midi,
je l'ai entendu dire qu'il avait acheté un cheval
à des hommes près du terrain d'aviation.
Le terrain d'aviation ?
D'accord.
Merci.
Merci.
Eric.
La dernière fois que je t'ai vu,
tu étais sur le point de tout dire à ta femme.
Cette pensée me faisait tenir le coup.
Ça fait deux semaines maintenant.
Je ne sais pas...
à quoi tu penses, si tu vas bien ?
Je ne sais pas si je vais bien, Mary.
Je sais que ce n'est pas ce que je voulais.
Mary, je pense à toi chaque minute
de chaque jour,
Mary, je me réveille le matin
et j'aimerais tant que tu sois là.
Je sais que...
Je sais que je suis toujours marié et que j'ai une femme
et que je lui dois...
quelque chose.
Je ne sais pas quoi dire Mary,
j'aurais aimé le faire
mais je ne l'ai pas fait.
Ça ressemble à un hôpital ici.
Je pensais en avoir encore pour 20 ans
avant d'en arriver là !
J'ai chaud !
Je parie que tu ne pensais pas voir la maison
remplie d'enfants non plus.
Je m'inquiète pour Jake.
Moi aussi.
Je ne pense pas que j'oublierai
la nuit où j'ai reçu cet appel...
J'y suis allé, Mitch Cafferty était menotté,
l'autre gamin couvert de sang, et j'ai pensé que...
qu'un de ces types aurait pu être Jake.
- Bonjour Stanley.
- Bonjour.
Désolé de vous déranger Mme Greene,
M. le Maire, mais...
je dois vous parler.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Mes maïs sont infestés de vers,
et, je sais que c'est beaucoup demander, mais j'espérais
que vous auriez des pesticides dans votre ranch,
aucun autre fermier ne veut s'en séparer.
Je suis désolé Stanley,
as-tu essayé auprès de Gracie?
Ouais... elle ne m'en donnera pas.
Ecoutez, j'ai besoin de tuer ces insectes, sinon je vais
devoir récolter trop tôt, ou tout sera détruit.
Est-ce qu'elle réalise que vous avez
la plus grosse ferme de Jericho ?
Je veux dire, si on perd ces récoltes,
on va tous mourir de faim !
Nous devons nous réunir au plus vite,
et nous déciderons comment rationner tout ça.
Attendez une minute.
C'est mon maïs.
Bien sûr Stanley,
c'est juste qu'on a besoin que tu le partages,
nous sommes livrés à nous-même,
et la ville n'a presque plus de nourriture.
Je veux bien faire mon boulot, M. le Maire,
mais je ne vais pas donner ma récolte.
Stanley, il y en aura suffisamment
pour vous et Bonnie,
suffisamment pour tout le monde.
Pour 5.000 personnes plus le bétail
pendant Dieu sait combien de temps?
Je ne suis pas le seul fermier de cette ville,
pourquoi suis-je le seul visé ?
Stanley, personne n'a été visé.
On dirait pas, Monsieur. Tout le monde veut ma récolte,
le gouvernement, Gracie et maintenant vous !
Stanley, nous essayons juste de...
Avec tout mon respect,
je vais m'en occuper moi-même.
Stanley, reviens et assieds-toi chéri.
Stanley, reviens ici maintenant !
Salut, toi.
Jake.
Dale, qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je suis désolé.
Je savais pas.
- Tu savais pas quoi ?
- Jake !
Jake ?
Toi, tu recules.
Fous le camp d'ici, Dale.
Non.
Reste ici, prends ça pour un apprentissage.
Tu as dépassé les bornes.
Pardon ?
Tu m'as bien entendu.
En venant dans notre ferme.
J'ai dépassé les bornes ?
On m'a mis en tôle...
le soir ou tu as été libéré sous caution.
Mon meilleur pote...
s'est à moitié fait exploser la tête.
Je t'avais prévenu que je ne voulais voler personne.
Allez, arrête de faire le saint.
Tu es revenu pour... te poser ?
Fonder une famille, faire le paysan ?
J'avais pas prévu de rester.
Bien sûr.
Mais tu veux aller où ?
Les bagnoles marchent plus.
On n'a bientôt plus de chevaux.
Si toi...
ou n'importe qui d'autre s'approche
à nouveau de ma famille, je te tuerai.
Voilà, ça c'est le Jake que je connais.
Bon, maintenant lève-toi.
Je t'emmène voir John.
Arrêtez !
Shérif !
Pas un geste.
Où est Mitchell ?
Je sais pas.
Je te connais Sean... tu mens.
Dale?
Ça va être ton tour.
Comment on peut gérer ça ?
On a rien contre eux, le juge le plus proche est au tribunal
du Comté, en admettant qu'il y en ait encore un.
Le problème, ce sont ces gamins ?
Ou Mitchell Cafferty ?
Il a volé les chevaux de ma mère,
et il aurait pu la faire tuer.
Il y avait des histoires entre vous déjà bien avant, Jake.
J'ai lu son dossier.
Il va nous poser des problèmes, non ?
Maintenant qu'on a perdu le Shérif et la moitié de ses Adjoints,
Mitchell et ses gars vont pouvoir s'attaquer à la ville.
On doit les arrêter maintenant.
Bon, si on veut des renseignements,
on doit les séparer.
D'accord, j'emmène Sean dans le couloir.
Non.
Lui, je m'en occupe.
Debout, on va faire un tour.
Va te faire foutre, j'ai pas à...
En avant.
<i>On a volé des pesticides chez Gracie.</i>
Tu sais quelque chose ?
Non. En fait, j'y suis allé pour en acheter, mais...
Mais quoi ?
D'accord, c'est quoi le problème ?
A quoi tu joues ?
Gracie est venue au poste.
Elle jurait par tous les Dieux.
Elle t'accuse de les avoir volés.
Elle m'accuse de les avoir volés ?
Ça te dérange si je jette un coup d'oeil ?
Oui, ça me dérange, Bill.
C'est complètement dingue !
Que se passe-t-il ?
J'en sais rien.
Une de mes meilleurs amis m'accuse
d'avoir volé des pesticides.
Je vais voir dans la grange.
Je t'ai pas dit que tu pouvais y aller.
Fais gaffe.
C'est bon. Laisse-le faire ce qu'il veut.
Très bien, fouille la grange.
Fouille toute la baraque si tu veux !
Je sais pas comment tu t'es retrouvé avec Mitchell,
mais tu dois rester loin de lui.
Je suis sérieux.
Tu risques de finir en tôle, ou bien pire.
Comment tu t'es retrouvé avec lui ?
J'étais stupide...
et je recherchais les ennuis.
Tu recherches les ennuis ?
Dale.
Pourquoi ils te gardent ici ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
On faisait que parler.
Sans avocat, tu n'as pas le droit.
- Je suis pas flic.
- De toute façon, je viens payer sa caution.
Je sais que plus rien ne marche,
mais tu dois la prendre.
Va t'en.
Tu me laisses partir ?
Ouais.
J'essayais juste de te raisonner un peu.
Crois-moi, tu n'as pas intérêt à suivre cette voie.
Je pense savoir où est Mitchell.
Je vous y amènerai.
Papa ?
Papa ?
Papa ?
Allez, sors d'ici.
Toutes ces villes ont disparu ?
A ton avis ?
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Je n'en suis pas sûr.
D'accord.
Ce sont toutes les villes dont j'ai entendu parler
grâce à la radio, ou par le satellite, avant l'EMP.
Pourquoi ton portable n'a pas grillé
comme tout le reste ?
Il est protégé.
Il est conçu pour résister à une EMP.
C'est...
C'est du matériel fourni par le Gouvernement, chérie.
T'es une sorte d'espion ?
C'est pour ça qu'on est venu ici.
Tu savais que ça allait arriver.
Et pourquoi tu as un flingue ?
A quoi il sert ?
A tirer.
Et je pense qu'il serait temps que tu apprennes.
Tu vois, au train où vont les choses...
tu devras peut-être te défendre un jour.
Tu comprends ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
On s'expliquait.
D'accord ?
C'est bon.
T'es sûr ?
Parce qu'on pourrait vérifier les champs aussi,
rangée par rangée.
On a eu une plainte.
Et tout ce que tu trouves à faire maintenant,
c'est accuser quelqu'un ?
- Stanley.
- Non.
Que fais-tu de ma parole, Bill ?
Je fais juste mon boulot, mec.
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?</i>
Je vais brûler les champs.
T'as complètement perdu la tête.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
Je vais bruler les champs,
juste les parties infestées.
Mon Dieu, Stanley.
Tu n'as pas besoin de faire ça.
Ecoute, je vois pas ce que je peux faire d'autre.
C'est moi qui ai les pesticides.
De quoi tu parles ?
J'ai payé des gamins pour les voler chez Gracie.
On a juste à retourner en ville et à les récupérer.
Tu as volé les pesticides ?
Quoi, tu ne m'as pas écouté ?
J'ai payé quelqu'un pour les voler.
Je leur ai donné ma montre en diamant.
J'arrive pas à croire qu'on en soit arrivé là.
On n'a pas vraiment le choix, Stanley.
C'est chacun pour soi maintenant.
- Il dort enfin.
- Super.
Comment tu te sens ?
Je m'accroche.
Je regrette de ne pas pouvoir faire plus pour lui.
C'est un homme têtu.
La pomme ne tombe jamais très loin de l'arbre.
Ce n'est certainement pas le cas pour Jake.
Je ne sais pas, vu que j'ai toujours
considéré qu'Eric était entêté.
Il est difficile à atteindre, alors ?
Et bien, il a dû faire face à beaucoup de choses.
Depuis que les missiles...
sans parler de nos nouvelles conditions de vie.
Oui.
Ça a commencé bien avant tout ça.
J'ai aussi vécu ça.
Essayer de recoller les morceaux...
n'est jamais facile.
Mais quelqu'un doit faire le premier pas.
Alors si tu veux te battre pour y arriver,
commence à te battre.
Tu dois mieux choisir les personnes avec qui tu traînes.
Je ne traîne pas avec ces gars.
J'avais juste besoin que Sean et Mitch m'aident
à déplacer certains trucs, c'est tout.
Je n'étais pas au courant pour les chevaux.
Et tu étais au courant de quoi alors, Dale ?
Hé, tu n'aurais jamais dû essayer de les protéger.
Ce n'est pas ce que j'ai fait.
J'essayais de protéger Gracie.
Comment ça ?
Un train plein de nourriture a déraillé.
C'est comme ça que Gracie s'approvisionnait.
Je voulais que personne ne le sache.
Tout est là-dedans.
Quoi ?
Cet endroit était plein à craquer, jusqu'au plafond.
C'est pas bien difficile de savoir qui a tout pris.
Gracie.
Dégage de mon magasin.
Je sais que tu m'as volé.
Non, ce n'était pas moi, Gracie.
Je te jure que ce n'était pas moi.
Gracie, on se connaît depuis combien de temps ?
Depuis toujours, non ?
On doit avoir confiance l'un dans l'autre.
Bon, laisse-moi te montrer.
Suis-moi.
Tu vois, Gracie, tout est là.
Personne n'a rien volé à personne, d'accord ?
C'était juste un malentendu.
Tu as une idée où il aurait pu aller ?
Non, aucune.
Reste ici.
Arrête-toi immédiatement, Mitchell !
Pose ton arme.
Pose ton arme !
Et maintenant les mains sur la tête.
Où est la nourriture ?
<i>Jake !</i>
<i>Arrête-toi.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Arrête-toi !</i>
Où est la nourriture ?
Arrête !
Qu'est ce qu'on fait de lui ?
Pour l'instant on l'enferme.
On peut peut-être envoyer quelqu'un à Fielding
pour voir si le tribunal fonctionne toujours.
Ses amis ne vont pas en rester là.
Je peux gérer ça.
Oui, comme tu as bien géré
la situation à la grange.
- J'aurais dû le tuer.
- Arrête, Jake.
Tu n'es plus le même homme maintenant.
Et ces deux là ?
Je pense qu'on pourrait laisser partir Dale,
mais Sean a aidé à voler les chevaux.
Ce n'est encore qu'un enfant.
Un enfant qui aurait pû te faire tuer, maman.
Et bien, ça ne change rien, Eric,
car je ne porterai pas plainte.
Cette cellule est bien trop petite pour pouvoir y mettre
toutes les personnes qui ont déjà commis une erreur.
Tu proposes quoi ?
La réhabilitation.
Bon.
Tiens-le bien.
Tous les doigts pliés.
Détends-toi.
Très bien.
C'est bien.
Respire.
Garde tes jambes comme ça.
Ecarte les un peu plus.
Très bien.
Maintenant, replie les genoux, vise.
Essaie de garder les yeux ouverts.
Appuie.
Très bien. Bon boulot. Bon boulot.
Très bien.
C'est du très bon boulot.
Tu aimes ça ?
Tu es sûr que ça va marcher ?
En théorie, oui.
Tu n'as jamais fait ça auparavant ?
Nan.
Et bien, ne t'en mets pas sur les chaussures.
Sérieusement, éloigne toi de moi.
Oh mon Dieu,
si seulement j'étais croyante.
Stanley.
Tu as dit que tu devais récolter aujourd'hui.
On est venu te donner un coup de main,
si tu veux bien.
Merci.
Maman.
Et bien, bonjour.
Je suis vraiment désolé, Mme Green.
Je suis désolé pour tout.
D'accord, et bien rendez-vous utile.
Pas la peine d'y penser.
Oncle Sam.
Vous avez déjà dormi dans une grange ?
Vous savez, c'est pas comme dans les films.
L'odeur peut devenir très forte là-dedans, avec les
cochons et les chèvres qui se frottent contre vous.
Vous me faites marcher.
Croyez-moi.
Tiens, c'est pour toi.
J'ai perdu la tête, Stanley.
Je suis désolé.
Merci.
Tu sais ce que tu fais ?
Pas la moindre idée.
Merci pour ton aide.
C'est aussi ta maison.
C'est vrai.
C'est un homme bon ou mauvais ?
Chérie, ça marche pas comme ça.
C'est plutôt cool, hein ?
Oui.
Surtout si on aime le maïs.
Dur travail, hein ?
Oui.
Je me disais qu'en partant d'ici, on pourrait peut-être...
J'allais dire faire une balade, mais on sera trop crevé...
April, arrête s'il te plaît, d'accord ?
Quoi ?
Ça.
Ce que tu es en train de faire.
Ca n'arrange rien.
J'essaie simplement de te parler, d'attirer
ton regard, quelque chose quoi.
Il y a trois semaines tu demandais le divorce.
Il y a trois semaines on ne vivait pas sur la même planète.
Les choses ont changé.
Laisse tomber.
April, attends.
Le trajet jusqu'à la maison...
On pourrait commencer par ça,
pour voir comment on se sent.
"J'emmerde cette ville"
"Jake Green 92"
Jake.
Tu es prêt pour ça ?
Tu sais qu'il va venir me chercher.
Et ensuite il en aura après toi.
Cette fois, pas moyen de s'échapper, Jake.

previously on jericho
O: All right,it looks like the explosion came from the west,maybe denver.
If it was an attack and there's chaos out there
you might not want the wrong people knowing that jericho is still here.
Johnston: The unfortunate truth is,there was another explosion in atlanta.
So,do we have a plan?
I will talk to april.
Tonight.
Secrets of a small town.
Divorce papers.
I had them drawn up before the bombs went off.
I don't want it.
The train that never showed up-- smashed into a car.
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.
If I knew anything I would tell your mayor.
hello.
This assistant secretary walsh from the department of homeland security.
Stay where you are.
Do not attempt to leave.
what's going on?
All right,everybody calm down,all right?
We'll have it back in a second.
are those ours or theirs?
They're headed up.
They must be ours.
Nearest missile silo's in wyoming,100 miles away.
So this is it?
We're at war?
enter psw
what's the target?
ours ot theirs
i'm compromised
Dad?
Hey,I want you to get your mom and samuel down here,and you wait for me until I come out.
What are you...
no,now,baby,now.
Well,if we're sending missiles,they must have figured out who attacked us.
God bless america.
Could have just decided to take out one of the usual suspects.
Which means there could be more missiles headed in our direction.
Well,is this the federal response we've all been waiting for?
end transmission
robert,the circuit breaker wasn't the breaker.
It was an emp.
It's an electromagnetic pulse.
Fries anything with a circuit board.
That means all electronics,appliances,anything with wires.
Does that mean another bomb has gone off somewhere?
What the hell was that?
Jake: It was an emp.
Everything's dead.
Well,is help on its way or not?
I don't think so.

2 weeks later
oh,dude!
Slow down.
What's the matter with you,huh?
Dale,hey,whoa,whoa,whoa.
What are you doing?
He broke our window,you saw him.
Dale.
Thanks a lot.
Dale,hold up.
What?
You all right?
They tried to break into the store twice this week.
Oh,that's terrible.
You got a problem?
Not me.
Dale's my buddy.
Right,dale?
You can't go around shoving people in the street,all right?
If you got a problem,you take it up with jimmy or bill.
All they'll do is write a report.
All right,well,then,come to me.
I can take care of myself.
There's got to be an easier way.
Maybe we can rig up the washing machine to work with the hand crank or something?
I'll be back tonight.
Where are you going,dad?
To the station.
So why you heading off to play cop?
Because people are starting to react to the fact that no one is coming to save them.
Okay?No one.
Because the world we knew does not exist anymore.
So if we can't keep order,we will not survivE.
Alison,give me a minute with your father.
Mom,I just...
now.
What the hell are you doing scaring our kids about the end of the world,robert?
Well,they have to understand what's going on.
You haven't been around for four years.
I'm the parent here,okay?
I'll decide what they need.
We cannot have photos up.
They might raise questions about us as a family.
I'm not in this.
Get rid of them,darcy.
People are trespassing on my land.
Well,we don't have the resources to control the whole town,carla.
You have to keep an eye on your own properties.
Our street's got a busted water main.My whole front lawn is flooded.
I'm trying to get some men on that right now.
Where's mayor green?
He is home recuperating from the flu.
Then who's running this town?
The mayor is still in charge,and,you know,these guys are doing the best job they can with a short staff.
Who the hell are you?
He is a volunteer and a deputy.
Now settle down and we'll get to you.
But you have to be patient.
Please.
Mary: How's your brother?
Eric pretty much keeps to himself.
Spends a lot of time at work making sure the town stays on its feet.
Really?
That's odd.
I just figured he'd be spending a little more time with his wife.
You know,now that they've lost the house and all.
They seem pretty happy together.
Man: Mitchell,wait up.
Looking good,mary.
We are not doing this again,mitch.
You're not welcome here.
Oh,come on,with everything that's happened,I'm just looking for a cold beer.
Well,we haven't served cold anything in a long time.
All right,just give me whatever you got.
Or I'll get it myself.
You might want to rethink that.
Everyone thought you went up in the blast.
But I knew you'd find a way to survive.
Oh,come on,let's not do it like this.
Besides,anyone should have a grudge,it's me,right?
I mean,you left me holding the bad when you blew town.
You know what,you're right.
Don't make me kick your ass again.
Robert: HeY.
Is everything all right?
You travel with your own personal bodyguard now?
That's probably not a bad idea.
Robert: What's the trouble here?
Oh,no trouble.
We're just two old friends catching up.
Well,maybe you should do that some other place.
And some other time.
See you soon.
Hey,mom.
Hi.
What are you doing home?
I'm just snagging another citation ledger.
Taken more complaints these last few days than we normally do in a month.
Well,jake and I are going out to the ranch to feed the horses in a little bit.
If you'd like to join us,maybe we could talk.
I'm sorry,I can'T.
With dad down,I'm struggling just to make sure things don't fall apart out there.
How 'bout things closer to home?
What's that supposed to mean?
How are you and april doing?
Why,did she say something?
Eric...
how's johnston?
I wish I had better news.
His fever's getting worse.
I'll try to dig up a stronger course of antibiotics at the med center,but we're running low on supplies.
God,if I could just get him to ear something.
Can you stay?
Don't worry about me,mom.
There's a box protein bars at the station.I'll just grab one of those.
Okay.
If you wait ten minutes,maybe we could walk together?
I got to go.
There's an important meeting.
Then that's where you should be.
We'll talk tonight.
Maybe we can put in a new starter.
No one can find a starter that works.
uncle sam!
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Can you please not call me that?
what did she say?
Oh,she says she likes your shoes.
Thank you.
I have a proposition.
The hotel I was staying in closed,and since you owe the government more than...$180,000...
no one's heard from the government in weeks.
Consider me the government.
Fine,then I still get to call you uncle sam.
Nice watch.
It's a rolex.
You got the time?
It's,um...
it just stopped working after the pulse,just like everyone else'S.
Well,I how about I pay you when it starts up again?
You're being an idiot.
I am trying to give you a chance to protect your interests.
You're too kind.
Hey,here's the deal.
You let me stay here,and I will deduct my room and board from what you owe the irs.
Fine,fine,why not?
I can use an extra field hand,and you can help bonnie with the cooking and the washing.
Okay,maybe you don't understand the nature of a deal.
I don't do housework.
Is that a cockroach?
We don't have cockroaches here.
Well,it landed right on me!
It's probably attracted to all that chicken crap in the yard.
Stanley,what's wrong?
What do you got there?
Rap sheet on mitchell cafferty.
Armed robbery,assault,gun-trafficking.
Yeah.
Mitch isn't one of jericho's finest.
What do you know about him?
Well,he hasn't given us trouble in a while.
He stays on the edge of town in a sort of compound with a bunch of guys.
Like survivalists?
I guess.
Why are you so interested?
Well,he was in bailey's this morning.
Had some words with your brother.
Looked like there was a bit of history there.
What did jake do about it?
Kept his cool,didn't engage.
Well,it's best we leave it alone,then.
Like you said,it's history.
Well,one thing that hasn't changed...
all this.
You remember when you first started riding?
Took to it like a fish to water.
You know,if you'd favored your father a little less and your dinky uncle dennis a little more,you would've been a hell of a jockey.
Talk to me.
I'm tired of hearing my own voice.
You okay?
Yeah,just tired.
I'm gonna get the water.
mom!Stay down!
Who are those guys?
xxxxxxxxx
I'll get you some aspirin for the pain and swelling.
I'm sorry I can't offer anything stronger.
I-it's okay,honey.
I don't need anything else.
Don't argue with her,gail-- doctor's orders.
Damn bastards.
Jake?
Where are you going?
To find mitch.
And then what?
I don't know yet.
Well,hold on,jake,you don't know for sure if he's behind this.
It was him.
You said yourself you didn't get a good look.
Now,look...
you know,I would like nothing better than to string up the guys who did this,but that's not the way we do things.
Last time you got mixed up with mitch cafferty,you left town and a boy was dead.
I'm not that guy anymore.Yeah?
Let's just make sure that it stays that way.
Look,if I don't care of him,he'll come back.
We've got to do this right.
You know that...
if this family starts breaking the law,how are we supposed to enforce it?
Gracie,you still have those crop pesticides?
Everything I got left is right there on that shelf.
Thank god.I'm gonna need everything you got to protect my corn.
Can anyone even eat that corn?
What about that rain we had?
No,it's okay.
The husks kept it safe from the fallout.
It was already mature,so the ears didn't take up any of that moisture.
You sure about that?
Gracie,you think I'd let my sister eat it if I didn't ink it was safe?
You think i would?
After what I've been exposed to?
I'll give you 20 bushels for those pesticides.
Well,I was thinking we'd split the harvest,half and half.
Half?
What are you,crazy?
Well,how you gonna sell your corn?
Give it to me,I'll sell it here,and we'll share the profit.
Mimi: Richmond farm belongs to the U.S.Treasury.
You're lucky we just don't commandeer what we need.
I'd like to see you try.
All right,let's go.
Hey,jimmy.
Eric,what's up?
Hey,mary.
Where the hell have you been?
We think mitch cafferty and his cohorts stole some horses.
I know they were here earlier; I thought maybe you might have heard something.
Anything you might know,mary,would really help.
There was a man here this afternoon.
I heard him say that he bought a horse from some guys out at the airfield.
The airfield.
All right.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Eric.
The last time I saw you,you were gonna tell your wife about us and we were gonna start our life together.
That thought has kept me going.
That was nearly two weeks ago.
I don't know...
what you're thinking,I don't know if you're okay.
I don't know if I'm okay,mary.
I know this is not what I wanted.
Mary,I think about you every minute of every day.
Man,I wake up in the morning,and I want it to be you there so badly.
I know I...
I'm still married,and I have a wife,and I owe her...
something.
I don't know what to say,mary.
I wish I did,but I don'T.
It's like a damn infirmary in here.
Thought it'd be at least 20 years before it came to this.
I'm hot!
I'll bet you didn't expect a house full of kids,either.
I'm worried about jake.
So am I.
I don't think I'll ever forget the night I got that call.
Went out there and saw that mitch cafferty in handcuffs,that other kid all covered in blood,and all I could think is...
one of those boys could've been jake.
oh,hi,stanley.
Hi.
Sorry to bother you,mrs.Green,mayor,but I,uh...
I need to talk to you.
What is it?
I found corn worms in my crop...
and I know this is a long shot,but I was hoping maybe you'd have some pesticides out at your ranch.
None of the other farms can spare 'em.
Sorry,stanley.Have you tried gracie's?
Yeah.She-she won't give 'em up.
You see,I need to kill these bugs,or I'd have to harvest what's good today,or it's-it's all gone.
Does she realize you have the biggest farm in jericho?
I mean,if we lose his crops,we all starve.
We're just gonna have to put together a crew as quick as we can,and we'll have to figure out how to ration it.
Stanley: Hang on a minute.
This is my corn.
Well,of course it is,stanley-- it's just right now we need you to share.
I mean,we're on our own here,and the town's nearly out of food.
Well,now,I'm willing to do my part,mayor,but I'm not giving up my crop.
Stanley,there'll be plenty enough for you and bonnie.
Plenty enough for everyone.
For 5,000 people plus livestock for god knows how many months?
I am not the only farm in this town.Why am I being targeted?
Stanley,nobody's being targeted.
It sure doesn't seem that way,sir-- all of a sudden everybody's laying claim to my crop-- the irs,gracie,and now you.
Stanley,we're just...
all due respect,I'll take care of it myself.
Oh,stanley,come and sit down,honey.
Stanley,come on back here,now.
hey,girl.
Jake.
Dale,what are you doing here?
I'm so sorry.I didn't know.
Didn't know what?
Jake!
jake?
You back away.
Get the hell out of here,dale.
No.
Stick around-- think of this as initiation.
You've crossed the line.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Coming to our family's ranch.
I crossed the line?
I went to jail...
that night that you bailed on us.
My best friend...
had half of his head blown off.
I told you I wasn't gonna rob anybody.
Oh,come on,stop acting like an angel.
You come back to...settle down?
Raise a family,maybe do a little farming?
I never planned on staying.
Of course not.
But where you gonna go?
Cars don't work.
We're fresh out of horses.
Jake: If you...
or anybody ever come near my family again,I will kill you.
Now,that's the jake I know.
All right,now get uP.
I'm taking you to go see john.
stop!Sheriff!
Don't even move.
Where's mitchell?
Don't know.
I know you,sean.You're lying.
Dale?
You're next.
What am I gonna do about this?
Can't charge them with anything and the nearest judge is in the county seat and we don't even know if that exists anymore.
Is this about these kids?
Or mitchell cafferty?
He stole my mother's horses and he could have gotten her killed.
Oh,you had run-ins with this guy long before that,jake.
I've read his file.
He's gonna be a problem,right?
And now with the sheriff and half our deputies dead,mitchell and his kind are gonna prey on this town like locusts.
We need to stop them now.
Well,if it's information you want,first thing we do is separate them.
All right,I'll take sean into the hallway.
No.
I'll do it.
Get up.We're going for a walk.
Screw that,I don't have to...
Walk.
Some pesticides got stolen over at gracie'S.
Do you know anything about it?
No.I mean,I was there earlier trying to buy some,but...
but what?
All right.What's going on?Why are you acting like this?
Gracie came down to the station.
Started raising all kinds of hell.
She says you stole 'em.
She told you I stole them?
You mind if I take a look around?
Yeah,I do,bill.This is nuts!
What's going on?
I don't know.
One of my best friends is accusing me of stealing pesticides.
I'm gonna check the barn.
I didn't say you could go in there.
Watch it.
It's okay.Just let him do what he wants to do.
Fine,check the barn.
Check the whole damn house!
How you got mixed up with mitchell but you need to stay away from him.
I'm serious.You can wind up in jail or a lot worse.
How did you get mixed up with him?
I was stupid.
And bored and looking for trouble.
Are you looking for trouble?
Dale.
Why are they keeping you here?What'd you do?
I'm just talking to him.
You can't without an attorney.
I'm not a cop.
I'm bailing him out anyway.
I know the machines are down,but you have to take it.
Get out of here.
You're letting me go?
Jake: Yeah.
Just trying to talk some sense into you.
Believe me,you don't want to go down this road.
I think I know where mitchell is.
I'll show you.
dad?
Dad?
dad?
Come on,out of here.
Are all those cities gone?
What do you think?
How do you know?
I don't for sure.
Okay.
Those are the cities I heard about through the ham radio,and the satellite feed before the emp.
Home come your laptop wasn't fried like everything else?
It's ruggedized.
It is built to withstand an emp.
The,um...
the government issues them,baby.
So you're some kind of spy?
That's why you moved us here.
You knew this was gonna happen.
Why do you have that gun?What's it for?
Shooting.
And I think it's probably time you learned how.
You see,the way things are going...
you may have to defend yourself one day.
Do you understand?
Hey,what's going on?
We were just catching up.
Right?
You're clear.
Are you sure?
Because we can check the fields.We can go through them row by row.
We got a complaint.
So all you gotta do now is accuse someone?
Stanley.
No.
What about my word,bill?
I'm just doing my job,man.
Mimi: What are you doing?
I'm gonna burn the field.
You've completely lost your mind.What happened to you?
I'm not gonna burn the whole field,just the infested partS.
Oh,my god,stanley.
You don't need to do this.
Look,it's the only thing I can think of.
I got the pesticides.
What are you talking about?
I paid some kids to steal them from gracie's store.
We just have to get into town and pick them up.
You stole the pesticides?
What,am I talking to myself?
I paid someone to steal them.
I gave them my diamond watch.
I can't believe this is what we've come to.
We don't really have a choice,stanley.
It's every man for himself now.
He's finally asleep.
Great.
How are you feeling?
I'm hanging in there.
I'm sorry there isn't more I can do for him.
That's one obstinate guy in there.
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Certainly not as far as jake's concerned.
I don't know as I've ever really thought of eric as being stubborn.
Hard to reach,then?
Well,he's had a lot on his plate.
Since the missiles...
not to mention your new living arrangement.
Yeah.
It started long before all of this.
I've been where you are.
Putting something back together...
isn't ever easy.
But somebody's got to take the first step.
Now,if you want to fight for this thing,start fighting.
You need to be smarter about who you hang out with.
I don't hang out with those guys.
I needed sean and mitch to help me move some stuff,that's all.
I didn't know about the horses.
Well,what did you think,dale?
Hey,you never should have tried to protect them.
I wasn'T.I was trying to protect gracie.
What do you mean?
A train crashed full of food supplies.
It's how I've been keeping gracie stocked.
I didn't want anyone to know about it.
It's all in there.
What?
This place was full.It was stacked to the rafters.
I guess we know who took it.
Gracie.
You get the hell out of my store.I know you stole from me.
No,I didn't,gracie.I swear I didn'T.
Gracie,how long have you known me?
My whole life,right?
We have to trust each other.
Just,just,let me show you.
Follow me.
You see,gracie?It's all here.
Nobody stole anything from anyone,okay?
It was a misunderstanding.
Eric: Do you have any idea where he would have moved it to?
Dale: No,no,I don'T.
You stay here.
Stop right there,mitchell!
Put your gun down.
Put your gun down!
Now put your hands up.
where's the food?
Eric: Jake...
stop.
What are you doing?I said,"stop.
" Where's the food?
Stop!
So what are we doing to do about him?
Eric: We lock him up for now.
Maybe we can send someone to fielding,see if the courthouse is still running.
His friends aren't going to let this go.
I can handle it.
Yeah,you handled it real good back at the barn.
I should have killed him.
Stop it,jake!
You're not that guy anymore.
What about these two?
Eric: Now I can see letting dale go,but sean helped steal the horses.
He's still a boy.
A boy who could have gotten you killed,mom.
Well,it doesn't matter,eric,because I'm not pressing charges.
This cell is too small to hold everybody who ever made a mistake.
What do you suggest?
Rehabilitation.
Okay.
Okay,hold it.
All fingers wrapped.
Okay,relax.
Right.
It's okay.
Breathe.
Nice.Stand with your legs like so.
A little further apart.
Right.
Now bend your knees,take your sight.
Try to keep your eyes open.
Squeeze.
Right.Good job,good job.
All right.
That's a very good job.
You like that?
are you sure this is going to work?
In theorY.
You've never done this before?
Nope.
Well,don't get it on your shoes.
Seriously,get away from me.
Oh,my god,I wish I prayed.
Gail: Stanley.
you said you needed to harvest today.
We're here to help,no strings attached.
thanks.
mom.
Well,hello.
I'm really sorry,mrs.Green.
I'm sorry for everything.
All right,well,go make yourselves useful.
forget it.
Man: Uncle sam.
You ever slept in a barn before?
You know,it's not like it is in the movies.
It can get pretty fragrant in there with all the pigs and goats brushing up against you.
You're bluffing.
Try me,please.
these are for you.
I lost my head,stanley.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
you have any idea what you're doing?
not a clue.
thanks for your help.
this is our home,too.
Right.
is he a good man or a bad man?
baby,there's no such thing.
kind of cool,huh?
Yeah.

Précédemment dans Jericho ...
<i>On dirait que l'explosion venait de l'ouest,
peut-être de Denver.</i>
<i>Mais si c'était une attaque, que c'est le chaos dehors.</i>
<i>Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises
personnes sachent que Jericho est toujours là !</i>
<i>La mauvaise nouvelle, c'est qu'il y a eu
une autre explosion à Atlanta.</i>
<i>Plus que d'électricité ou de nourriture,
cette ville a besoin d'information.</i>
<i>On organise plusieurs groupes,
et on les envoie dans toutes les directions.</i>
<i>Shep et Gray devraient être revenu.</i>
<i>- C'est plutot cool, hein ?
- Ouais, surtout si on aime le maïs.</i>
<i>Viens, je te racompagne.</i>
<i>C'est pas trop bizarre de revenir chez toi
après si longtemps ?</i>
<i>Un peu.</i>
<i>Le grand Johnston Green terrassé par une grippe.</i>
<i>J'aimerai pouvoir faire plus pour lui.</i>
<i>Le train qui n'est jamais arrivé,</i>
<i>il a percuté une voiture,
et il y des tonnes de nourriture à l'intérieur.</i>
<i>Cet endroit était plein a craquer, jusqu'au plafond</i>
<i>- C'est pas bien difficile de savoir qui a tout pris.
- Arrête-toi tout de suite Mitchell !</i>
<i>Arrêtez, Shérif !</i>
<i>Tu sais qu'il va venir me chercher.
Et ensuite il en aura après toi.</i>
Où il est ?
Jonah ?
Que se passe-t-il, Pete ?
Mitchell s'est fait arréter.
Pour quelle raison ?
On a pris quelques chevaux,
tu sais, dans un des ranchs hors de la ville,
et Mitchell s'est fait prendre.
Et bien... Mitchell est un idiot.
Mais le truc c'est que...
le ranch où on était...
appartient à Johnston Green.
La femme du Maire a été un peu secouée.
Mais rien de bien méchant.
Mais... attends.
Attends un peu.
C'était l'idée de qui, la tienne ou la sienne ?
C'était la sienne.
Je suis désolé.
Je m'excuse.
Je m'excuse.
Excuses acceptées.
<i>Elle descend de la montagne, à cheval...</i>
<i>Elle descend de la montagne, à cheval...</i>
- Elle descend...
- Ca suffit, Mitchell.
Où est Jake ?
Tu ferais mieux d'aller le chercher,
parce que quand Jonah viendra pour moi,
il voudra avoir une petite
discussion avec Jake.
S'il doit aller le chercher
ça rendra les choses bien plus compliquées.
Peu importe.
Gardez-le simplement ici, d'accord ?
C'est mieux de lui dire de se tenir prêt.
En fait...
vous devriez tous vous tenir prêts.
Très bien.
Mallo Cups.
- C'est comme ça que ça s'appelait.
- Mon Dieu, comme j'adore ça.
- Les meilleurs.
- J'ai toujours eu plus de bonbons que toi, tu te souviens ?
Parce que tu trichais.
Pour Halloween, tu allais réclamer des bonbons
dans tout le quartier avec un déguisement,
puis tu recommençais avec un autre déguisement.
Allez, Eric, tout le monde le faisait.
Exact, sauf toi.
Pour Jake et moi, Halloween était tout un art.
C'était toujours moi qui faisais la clocharde, comme ça
je pouvais fourrer tous ses costumes dans mon sac poubelle.
Je pense que nous avons frappé à la porte des Stevens,
quelque chose comme sept fois la même année.
Il partageait toujours son butin avec moi, pourtant.
On était des petits Bonnie and Clyde.
C'était tellement adorable.
Ca te gêne si je continue
à te poser des questions à son sujet ?
Pourquoi ça me gênerait ?
Je ne sais pas.
As-tu le béguin pour Jake ?
Non...
- Ok, sauf, peut-être, oui, juste un petit peu.
- Un petit peu.
- Je suis désolée, c'est vraiment bizarre.
- Ce n'est pas bizarre.
Ecoute, ça fait longtemps.
Fais juste attention, ok ?
Pourquoi ?
Il y a beaucoup de choses que
tu ne sais pas à propos de Jake, ok ?
C'est la voiture de Jake ?
- Oh mon Dieu.
- Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- Je peux vous ai... der ?
- Je suis ici pour payer la caution d'un de mes amis.
Mitchell Cafferty.
Bonjour, Jonah.
Jake.
Ca faisait longtemps.

Cinq ans. Alors...
- Je crois comprendre que Mitchell a causé quelques problèmes.
- Allez, ne fais pas semblant d'être surpris.
Il n'y a pas un matin où il se lève sans parler de toi.
Je ne suis pas sûr que ce soit vrai...
Mais je suis ici pour payer sa caution.
Très bien, donc parlons caution.
- Premièrement, tu vas rendre tout ce que tu as volé...
- Attends un peu.
Je ne suis pas sûr que tu aies remarqué,
mais le monde est en train de s'écrouler.
Qui possède quoi devient très subjectif, Jake.
- Mais je verrai ce que je peux faire.
- Très bien, et ensuite tu resteras loin d'ici.
- Et pas que toi... Mitch, Joe Kelly...
- Depuis quand parles-tu au nom de la ville ?
- Marché conclu ?
- Tais-toi, Mitchell !
Marché conclu.
Oh, je vois que tu es réveillé.
It doit être midi.
Je suis debout depuis un moment.
Hey, ferme la porte de devant.
Quoi ? Tu es né dans une grange ?
Tu es né dans une grange ?
Ca fait presqu'une semaine que tu es ici et cette
blague n'en devient pas plus drôle.
J'ai trouvé des cornflakes rassis dans le garde-manger.
- Comme personne d'autre ne semble en manger...
- Et bien, lâche toi.
Voilà, tu veux y ajouter un peu de lait ?
Et voilà.
Oh...
C'est encore chaud.
Ouais, et c'était encore plus chaud quand
c'était dans la vache il y a dix minutes.
- J'en ai fini avec mes cornflakes.
- Hummm...
Tu as fait ça exprès, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
- Au fait, où est l'entonnoir ?
- Ah, oui.
Je l'ai mis dans le tiroir à bazar.
Je n'arrivais pas à dormir la nuit dernière,
donc j'ai réorganisé la cuisine.
J'ai mis tout les objets non essentiels hors du triangle.
- Le triangle ?
- L'espace de travail qui relie les trois endroits critiques...
évier, cuisinière et plan de travail.
J'étais en train de rénover mon appart à Washington
avant d'échouer ici.
Tu sais, Mimi,
quand j'étais un jeune garçon en pleine croissance,
j'avais toujours l'impression que
quelque chose manquait dans ma vie.
Maintenant je sais.
C'était le triangle.
Evier, cuisinière, plan de travail.
On sait aussi utiliser le sarcasme à Washington, tu sais.
Ça fera l'affaire, Bob.
- S'il te plait, dis-moi que c'est du soda light.
- Non, c'est du normal.
Il y avait toujours une caisse pleine de soda light ici.
Gracie m'avait promis de la garder pour moi.
Y'a pas de quoi t'inquiéter, chérie.
Je l'ai rangée une fois qu'on s'était mises d'accord sur le prix.
Oh, tu as raison.
- C'est adorable.
- C'est une antiquité.
Es-tu sûre de vouloir faire ça, mon coeur ?
J'en suis sûre.
Dale, il y a une caisse de soda cachée
le long du mur du fond, à côté de ton lit.
Tu veux bien aller la chercher, s'il te plaît ?
Tu dors toujours ici ?
Je reviens.
- Que fais-tu ?
- Quoi ?
- Tu étais en train de faire refroidir ton thermomètre
dans ce verre d'eau, non ?  - Pas du tout.
Très bien, et si c'était le cas ?
Je vais bien.
J'en ai assez d'être materné.
Tu as 150° de température.
Repose-toi.
Tu vas prendre les médicaments qu'April t'a donnés.
Tu vas admirer cette
citrouille ridicule avec moi
et ensuite nous allons essayer de
manger cette... citrouille ensemble.
Parce que dans cette maison on ne jette rien.
- C'est bien compris ?
- En gros, oui.
Mais plus de médicaments.
Ca fait trois semaines que j'en prends,
et je ne veux pas que cette ville
manque d'antibiotiques par ma faute.
Très bien, maintenant tu m'écoutes.
Il se pourrait qu'arrive un jour où cette
ville ait à nouveau besoin que tu sois son héros.
Mais ce ne sera pas aujoud'hui.
Le monde change.
Tu crois que je ne le sais pas ?
Il n'y a pas beaucoup de boulot pour un type qui
transporte des marchandises en camion en ce moment.
Ce qui n'était qu'un à côté
devient une sorte de boulot à plein-temps.
Nous pourrions avoir besoin d'un gars comme toi là-bas.
Il y a beaucoup de trucs qui traînent sur les routes
et qui n'attendent que d'être ramassées.
Je veux ta parole.
Toi et tes copains allaient rester
loin de cette ville.
J'ai déjà dit que je le ferai.
En demandant encore une fois, on pourrait penser
que tu me prends pour un menteur.
- Et voilà ma voiture.
- Et bien, tu l'avais laissée là-bas.
- Ouais mais elle a été détruite.
Elle a été restaurée avec amour.
Je t'ai dit qu'il y avait beaucoup de
bons trucs à ramasser là-bas sur les routes.
Pour celle-ci je n'ai même pas eu à me battre.
En plus, elle était à moi en premier.
Emily...
- Pourquoi tu lui parlais ?
- C'est bon, ok?
Ca n'avait rien à voir avec toi.
C'est mon père. Ca a tout à voir avec moi.
T'imagines pas comme j'étais mal
quand tu es parti.
Il appelait,
il était partout,
il venait à la maison,
il voulait me parler,
il voulait que je le pardonne pour
ce qui est arrivé à Chris.
Je ne lui pardonnerai jamais.
- Et maintenant, t'es de retour, lui aussi.
- Il n'est pas de retour.
D'accord ?
Après demain, il aura fini, il sera parti.
- Quand c'est supposé se passer ?
- Demain matin, à 11h00.
- Donc, on reprend la nourriture
et Prowse nous laisse tranquille ?
- C'est ce qu'il a dit.
- Ouais, on verra ce qu'il fera.
- De toute façon, je pense que
c'est important qu'on le fasse.
- Ok, je vais en parler à Papa.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Viens par là.
Gray Anderson est de retour.
<i>- Est-ce qu'il va bien ?
- J'arrive pas à y croire.</i>
Je suis... Merci.
Je suis monté dans un...
un camion de ravitaillement
de bouteilles d'eau
qui allait à un campement de la FEMA
près de Rogue River.
<i>La FEMA* s'organise ?
*FEMA: Federal Emergency Management Agency</i>
C'est déjà pas mal.
A 18 kms de Topeka,
on a rencontré un barrage routier.
Je veux dire, rien d'officiel,
juste deux voitures bloquant la route.
Et dès qu'on s'est arrêtés, il y a eu...
une douzaine de gars sortis de nulle part
qui nous ont arrachés du camion.
J'ai... assomé l'un d'eux et je suis barré en courant.
Le chauffeur...
ils l'ont frappé à mort et l'ont laissé par terre.
Ils l'ont tué juste pour...
quelques bouteilles d'eau.
Et vous, vous avez encore de l'électricité,
des lampes ou quelque chose ?
- Il y a eu une sacrée impulsion.
- Non.
Quelques circuits simples fonctionnent encore
comme les lampes de poches et
les rasoirs électriques, mais...
on a perdu pratiquement tout ce qui contient
un circuit électrique,
radio, ordinateurs,
les voitures récentes.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé à Topeka ?
- C'est le bordel.
Personne ne sait où est le gouverneur.
Et les retombées venant de Lawrence
les ont gravement touchés.
Hé, hé... Ils... Ils ont bombardé Lawrence ?
- Pourquoi Lawrence et pas Topeka ?
- J'en sais rien.
- Et les autres grandes villes ? New York, DC ?
- Oh, ils ont pas eu New York.
Quoi, New York s'en est sorti ?
Ouais, après le 11 septembre, ils ont
amélioré leur sécurité et apparemment,
la police de NY a attrapé trois gars
juste avant qu'ils pressent l'interrupteur.
Ils avaient un van de location,
une bombe de 20.000 tonnes
dans une caisse en acier.
Et Washington ?
En fumée.
Hé.
- T'as entendu ?
- Entendu quoi ?
M. Anderson est de retour.
Il dit que New York existe toujours.
New York ?
- Mes parents ?
- Peut-être qu'ils vont bien.
Mes parents.
Hé. T'en as mis du temps.
Ta soeur est allée se coucher
il y a un petit bout de temps.
Je suis quasiment sûre qu'elle
me déteste toujours autant.
Bien qu'elle m'ait enfin dit "Bonne nuit"
sans me faire ce signe.
Je me demande si elle sait
que je sais ce que ça veut dire.
J'ai des mauvaises nouvelles.
Mimi...
- Quoi ?
- Washington DC n'existe plus.
Tu sais, les remuer ne les rend pas meilleures.
Alors... Cindy Mather est morte ?
Si elle était à Washington...
alors probablement.
Ca dépend où elle était
quand la bombe a explosé.
Et Joel Stafford ?
Il voulait sortir avec moi.
C'est ce que disait Cindy.
Est-ce qu'ils ont senti quelque chose
quand ils sont morts ?
- Joel... Cindy, les Thompson d'à côté
- Ca, euh...
ça a été rapide.
- Et Doug.
- Qui est Doug ?
Le petit ami de maman.
Je pensais que tu le savais.
T'es devenu fou ?
T'as passé un marché avec Jonah Prowse ?
Ouais, Mitch contre la nourriture et
Jonah reste en dehors de Jericho. Pourquoi ?
- Parce que tu ne peux passer de marchés
avec des gars comme ça.
- Attends un peu, on en a parlé, on était d'accord.
Ecoute, je suis au courant pour Prowse.
Il transportait du matériel pour Stevens
avant que j'arrive à la mine.
Il piquait 5% de la marchandise,
en intimidant les fournisseurs.
Ce mec a fait 4 ans à Lansing pour
extorsion et agression.
Tu veux négocier avec ce type ?
Il marque un point, Jake.
- Et si on en parlait avec papa ?
- Ecoute, sans manquer de respect à ton père,
il était pas là dehors.
J'ai vu ce qu'il arrivait quand les gens
perdent tout ce qu'ils ont.
Tu commences par conclure un marché
avec les mauvais types, c'est le début de la fin.
Calme toi, d'accord ?
On a plus besoin de nourriture
que de garder Mitchell Cafferty.
Je suis supposé faire l'échange avec Jonah
dans une heure.
- Si j'y vais les mains vides,
je sais pas ce qu'il va faire.
- Ca n'a pas d'importance.
Parce qu'il saura qu'on retournera
pas le chercher.
Ecoute, Jake...
ce territoire nous appartient toujours ou non ?
Eric ?
Gray a raison.
Je sais que c'est seulement la moitié
des sodas que l'on a échangés
mais je dois vraiment récupérer cette boîte.
- Oh, désolée chérie.
On a fait un marché.
Je viens de découvrir que mes parents
sont peut-être en vie.
- Ils peuvent revenir n'importe quand.
- Oh, c'est une bonne nouvelle.
Je suis contente pour toi.
Cette boîte à bijoux appartenait à ma mère.
Sa grand-mère lui avait donné, c'est...
ça vaut beaucoup plus que quelques sodas light.
J'aurais aimé t'aider,
mais je l'ai déjà échangée.
- Avec qui ?
- Tous les échanges sont confidentiels.
Personne n'achète de boîte à bijoux
en demandant à qui elle appartenait.
Je suis sûre que tes parents comprendront.
Les temps sont durs pour nous tous.
Ok, très bien.
Dale, euh, est-ce que tu peux
enfermer ça à l'arrière, s'il te plait ?
- On dirait que t'as oublié quelqu'un.
- La ville a refusé l'échange avec Mitch.
Comment je peux arranger ça ?
Ooh !
Tu m'as fait peur.
Hey, c'est un gentil fantôme.
<i>Oh, c'est pour toi...</i>
Pas de bonbons ici les enfants.
Gray !
Gray !
Les hommes de Jonah viennent de libérer Mitchell.
Ils sont partis par devant.
Hey !
Hey !
Gray, non !
- Jake, on peut pas les laisser partir !
- Sinon quoi ? Tu préfères déclencher une fusillade en pleine rue ?
- Je dois les rattraper !
- T'as perdu la tête ?
- On doit réagir, Jake.
Quoi, tu penses qu'ils vont se calmer ?
- Je donne pas longtemps avant qu'ils reviennent.
- Je vais parler à Jonah.
- Tu veux parler à Jonah ? Vas le voir !
Il a respecté sa part du marché.
- Mais pourquoi tu défends ce type ?
- Je protège la ville.
- Il peut nous fournir ce qui nous manque.
- Quoi ?  - De la nouriture...
De l'essence, des munitions.
Si on en a besoin demain, tu peux en avoir ?
Tu peux ?
Lui, oui !
On va faire ça à ma façon maintenant.
Tu m'avais dit que tu pouvais m'avoir une voiture.
- Cette chose va me lacher à mi-chemin.
- Charlotte ? Non, elle est solide.
- Sois prudent.
- C'est à 15 kms seulement.
Avec lui, je voulais dire.
J'ai parlé à Emily.
Ah ouais ?
Qu'est-ce qu'elle t'a dit ?
Suffisamment.
Darcy, Allie et Sam font un barbecue dehors.
Ils font griller Spam, je pense.
Ils t'attendent.
Et...
Je sais pour Doug.
- Tu sais quoi ?
- Je pense qu'il a sûrement disparu.
Je sais...
- Je sais qu'il représentait beaucoup pour toi.
- Robby, tu ne sais rien du tout.
Est-ce que mes enfants le connaissent ?
- Pourquoi tu ne leur demandes pas ?
- Je ne veux pas leur demander, je...
Pourquoi es-tu venu ?
- Je t'ai dit que les enfants...
- Non, non. A Washington, tu aurais pu juste emmener les enfants.
On est restés bloqués 2 heures dans les
embouteillages ce jour là.
Tu n'avais pas besoin de m'attendre.
Pourquoi tu l'as fait ?
- Tu me détestais, Robbert.
- Non, je ne...  - Tu me détestais.
Tu m'en as voulu d'avoir annulé le mariage.
Et même après, tu as privilégié ton boulot
bien avant que je regarde un autre homme.
Je vais dire aux enfants que tu ne te sens pas très bien.
Je sors avec Doug depuis 3 mois.
Je l'ai rencontré à la gym.
J'ai aimé sa façon de me regarder.
Et j'ai aimé les sentiments que cela me procurait.
C'était agréable.
Je pensais le présenter aux enfants.
Et maintenant, je... je me retrouve ici avec
mes secrets et un homme qui me regarde...
comme ça.
Mon Dieu, Robert, pourquoi tu es revenu me chercher ?
Tu cours vite, Mitch.
Hé, arrêtez !
Laissez-le !
Arrêtez ça.
C'est bon, ça va.
Que me vaut le plaisir ?
A plusieurs personnes en ville qui ne
veulent pas en rester là.
Ils sont furieux.
Ils veulent venir ici et le récupérer,
par la force si besoin.
Qui aurait pu penser que quelqu'un
tienne autant à Mitchell Caferty ?
Ecoute, tu ne veux pas qu'on en arrive là,
et je ne veux pas qu'on en arrive là.
Je viens pour négocier.
La dernière fois qu'on a négocié,
ça ne m'a pas réussi.
Garde Mitch et la nourriture.
Tu peux vendre la nourriture à l'épicerie de Gracie Lee,
et pour ce dont tu as besoin, tu pourras prendre ta part.
eau, récolte,
le sel de la mine.
Continue.
En échange, tu garantis que tu mèneras tes...
affaires, loin de la ville.
On enverra un camion prendre la marchandise.
Ne viens pas en ville.
Je vais y réfléchir.
Maintenant parlons de ce dont j'ai besoin.
- Je veux parler à Emily.
- Elle ne veut pas te voir.
Elle m'en veut pour la mort de Chris.
- Tout pourrait être différent si elle savait qui est vraiment le coupable.
- Ce n'est pas moi qui l'ai envoyé faire ce boulot.
- J'ai essayé de l'en dissuader.
- Il lui fallait juste un soutien,
quelqu'un pour veiller sur ses arrières.
- Tu l'as laissé seul !
- Un soutien ?
Il avait besoin d'un père.
- Bon, il est peut-être temps qu'Emily apprenne la vérité.
- Je lui ai dit.
Je lui ai tout raconté.
- Elle t'a pardonné ?
- Non.
Moi non plus.
Dis-lui de venir me voir,
ou je mènerai mes affaires comme bon me semble.
- Je ne peux pas.
Alors considère qu'il n'y a pas de marché.
Ah, Eric, je peux te voir un instant ?
Bien sur. Qu'y a-t-il ?
Viens, rentre.
J'ai vu pas mal de visages inconnus par ici,
et je me suis un peu renseigné,
apparemment, il y a 8 nouvelles familles installées
depuis que j'ai quitté la ville, et 14 depuis les attaques.
Ouais, plusieurs familles ont hébergé des amis
venant des villes voisines.
- Beaucoup de gens du Colorado. Pourquoi ?
- On sait quelque chose sur eux ?
Ce qu'ils on fait, ce qu'ils savent ?
J'aime pas trop la tournure de cette discussion, Gray.
Et bien, moi non plus,
mais je suis sûr qu'on ne sera jamais trop prudent.
Tu veux parler de Robert Hawkins ?
Il a deux enfants.
Et il nous a beaucoup aidés.
Il est arrivé 2 jours après la catastrophe, avec assez
d'argent pour acheter la maison des Thompson.
Ecoute, je n'affirme rien.
Je... Je pense juste qu'on devrait en savoir un peu plus
sur les gens avec qui on partage ce trou à rat.
Ça nous coûte rien de demander.
Tu ne voudrais pas me parler de quelque chose ?
Que voulez-vous dire ?
La boîte à bijoux a disparu.
Est-ce que tu l'as volée, Dale ?
Dis quelque chose.
Pourquoi lui avez-vous menti ?
- Pourquoi vous lui avez dit que vous n'aviez plus la boîte ?
- On avait fait un échange honnête.
Je n'ai pas besoin de m'expliquer avec cette garce.
- Vous ne la connaissez pas.
- Je connais bien les gens de son espèce.
Ils pensent que les règles ne les concernent pas.
Je pourrais comprendre que les
autres essayent de me voler,
mais après tout ce que j'ai fait pour toi ?
- Tout ce que vous avez fait pour moi ?
- Je t'ai engagé.  - Et après ?
Vous me laissez dormir ici ?
C'est moi qui ai trouvé le train.
C'est moi qui me suis tapé 8 kms tous les jours
pour rapporter la nourriture.
Vous n'auriez plus de magasin si je n'étais pas là.
- Dale, chéri...
- Vous savez quoi ? C'est fini.
Voilà vos clés.
Dale, non !
Salut.
Où est Mary ?
On est mercredi, c'est son jour de congé.
- Qu'est ce que tu bois là ?
- Je sais pas.
Ca pourrait bien être du kérosène.
J'ai pas encore trouvé ce que c'était.
Comment ça s'est passé avec Jonah aujourd'hui ?
Je crois qu'on est parti dans un affrontement
qu'on aurait bien aimé éviter.
Super.
Et toi ? Ta journée ?
Et bien, je crois que je suis en train de devenir
le gentil toutou de Gray Anderson.
Le pire c'est que je suis même pas sûr
que ce soit une mauvaise chose.
Super journée pour les frères Green, hein ?
- Ouais. Tu évites de rentrer à la maison à cause de papa ?
- Putain ouais. Et toi ?  - Pareil.
Ouais. Tu te rappelles du jour où on a
mis le feu au tapis de son bureau ?
Tout ce que tu avais à faire c'était de suivre notre plan,
et on s'en serait tirés.
- Tu voulais que je dise à papa que j'avais eu une crise,
et que j'avais renversé sa lampe de bureau.  - Ouais.
T'as pas une autre idée brillante pour nous
tirer de ce mauvais pas là ?
Pas pour le moment.
Et bien, je suggère qu'on finisse nos verres,
qu'on rentre à la maison et qu'on essaye d'expliquer
tout ça à papa, sans que ça le tue.
Je pense que tu as assez bu.
Tu veux m'accompagner...
pour qu'on puisse finir notre conversation ?
- Non, j'ai suffisamment parlé aujourd'hui, Rob.
- Je ne plaisante pas, Darcy.
- Allons-y.
- Je t'ai dit non... pas cette fois.
Pourquoi tu rentres pas ?
Hé...
Je suis revenu te chercher parce que tu es ma femme.
Je ne sais pas si tu aimes la soupe de tomate.
Je ne sais pas pour toi,
mais moi en général ça me fait du bien, alors...
Ca donne quoi ?
Je viens de consulter tous mes dossiers en attente
et je n'arrive pas à me souvenir de la moitié des cas.
Cette pile c'est "presque clos" et celle-là,
c'est "pas prêts d'être finis".
- Tu n'as pas à faire tout ça.
- Qu'est-ce que je pourrais bien faire d'autre ?
Oh !
Oh !
Laisse-moi.
- J'essaye seulement de t'aider.
- Et bien, arrête.
Ecoute, je sais ce que tu traverses.
Tu m'entends ?
J'ai perdu mes parents quand j'avais 18 ans,
et les premiers jours étaient vraiment durs.
Tout ce que j'aimais est parti en fumée il y a un mois.
Et tu te permets de me dire que tu sais ce que je ressens ?
- J'essaye d'être gentil avec toi.
- Et bien, cesse d'être gentil avec moi !
Tu ne me dois rien.
Tu ne dois plus rien à personne.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je suis venue pour te parler,
mais quand je suis arrivée...
- Dépêchez-vous.
- Quoi.  - Allez dépêchez vous.
Il est en état de choc ou je sais pas quoi.
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq...
1001... 1002... 1003... 1004... 1005.
- Il ne respire plus.
- Allez, encore une fois.
Mettons-le sur le côté. Allez.
Je lui ai donné trois séries d'antibiotique.
Son corps n'a pas dû le supporter.
Il risque l'infection.
Comment ça se soigne ?
Un instant, April. Comment ça se soigne ?
Si le centre médical était opérationnel, peut-être.
Si on pouvait l'évacuer vers l'hôpital du Comté
à Rogue River, peut-être.
S'il nous restait des médicaments plus
puissants à la pharmacie, peut-être.
Sans ça...
12 heures.
Peut-être une journée.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Quelle sorte de médicaments ?
Quoi ?
Tu a dit qu'il avait besoin de médicaments puissants.
De quoi... de quoi a-t-il besoin ?
Quelque chose capable de combattre rapidement l'infection.
Que son corps combatte de lui-même.
Du Cipro sans doute, mais ça fait des semaines qu'on n'en a plus.
- Ils en ont à Rogue City, pourtant.
- Jake.
C'est à 150 kms d'ici !
- Je ferais mieux de partir tout de suite, alors.
- Attends.
Je viens aussi.
Eric, non.
Si Gray a raison à propos des dangers...
Vas-y.
Vas-y tout de suite.
Tu voulais parler.
Alors parlons.
- Tu veux t'asseoir ?
- Non, je ne suis pas là pour rattraper le temps perdu.
Le père de Jake Green est malade.
- Ah bon ?
- Oui.
Je me contrefous de ce que tu
penses de lui, d'accord ?
Je suis là pour te demander de m'aider.
Je ne suis pas médecin, chérie.
Non, en effet.
Tu es un voleur.
- Il a besoin de médicaments, du Cipro.
- J'en ai pas. Désolé.
Mais je peux peut-être t'aider.
- Tu as la même expression que ta mère.
- Arrête.
Ne me parle pas d'elle, ni de Chris. D'accord ?
Il paraît que tu vas te marier ?
C'est quel genre de type ?
- A combien de questions je vais devoir répondre
pour que tu m'aides ?  - Plus que ça.
- Il fait quoi, ton type ?
- Il est conseiller financier.
Emily.
J'ai respecté notre accord, je suis resté loin de toi.
Mais ces dernières semaines,
j'ai vu pas mal de sales choses.
Je veux juste m'assurer que quelqu'un veille sur toi.
Il ne reste plus que toi et moi maintenant.
Ta mère n'est plus là.
- Chris n'est plus là.
- On en est arrivés là ?
- Hein ?
- Quoi ?
Tu veux qu'on soit de nouveau une famille ?
Tu veux que quelqu'un t'invite pour Thanksgiving ?
Si tu penses une seule seconde
que c'est ce que je souhaite, tu rêves.
Je pense que pour quelqu'un qui me demande de l'aide,
tu as une drôle de manière de le faire, jeune fille.
Je vais t'aider.
Tu es ma fille.
Mais je pense que tous les deux,
on devrait plus se voir.
Dale.
- Où étais-tu ?
- Je t'ai cherché partout.
Comment as-tu eu ça ?
Merci.
Mon dieu, c'est pour ça que vous vous êtes disputés ?
Tu dors où ce soir ?
Chez un copain.
Chez un copain ?
Viens.
Tu peux dormir chez moi, sur le canapé.
- Je ne pense pas que ce soit une bonne idée.
- Je n'ai pas le choix.
Alors laisse-moi au moins réparer quelques trucs.
On n'a pas le temps.
- Faut que j'y aille maintenant.
- Quoi ? Attends ?
- Tu as dit qu'elle était solide.
- Solide, oui, si tu dois semer quelqu'un ?
- Pourquoi ? Elle monte à combien ?
- J'en sais rien.
50, peut-être 60 km/h, au mieux,
en descente, et pas pour très longtemps.
Ecoute, à mon avis, peut-être que tu devrais y aller à cheval.
- Un cheval est plus lent que ça.
- Un cheval risque moins d'exploser.
Je prends le risque.
Très bien, alors au moins ménage-la.
Garde un peu de puissance en réserve
au cas où tu en aurais besoin subitement.
et souviens-toi que le réservoir est sur la gauche.
donc si quelqu'un décide de te tirer dessus,
essaye de choisir le bon côté !
Rien d'autre ?
Reviens en un seul morceau.
Je le ferai, promis.
Je pensais que tu y allais.
J'attends Eric.
Oh.
Mmm...
- Fais gaffe aux géants irradiés là-bas!
- Comme toujours.
D'accord.
Tu vas quelque part ?
Oui, mon père a besoin de médicaments,
des trucs qu'on n'a pas ici.
Jake et moi on va à Rogue River
pour essayer d'en trouver.
Tu es sûr que c'est une bonne idée ?
Pas vraiment.
Ecoute, soyez prudent là-bas, d'accord ?
Vous ne...
Vous ne vous arrêtez pour rien au monde,
vous ne ralentissez même pas.
Je suis sérieux.
On sera de retour d'ici demain matin.
Tu pourrais garder un oeil sur ce qui se passe ici ?
Oui bien sûr, t'inquiète pas.
Ho, c'est quoi ce bordel ?
On doit rouler avec ça ?
Oui, je veux dire, ce n'est pas vraiment...
Ouais.
C'est quoi ça ?
Je pensais que le marché c'était qu'on
récupère la nourriture et que lui reste loin d'ici.
C'était bien ça.
Em ?
Je n'ai pas pu trouver les médicaments,
alors j'ai pris ce qu'il y avait de mieux.
Une voiture rapide.
Il m'a dit que c'était un cadeau.
Tu sais qu'avec lui, il n'y a jamais de cadeaux.
Je suis vraiment désolé que tu sois mêlée à tout ça.
Personne ne m'a forcé.
Va sauver ton père.
Eric ? On charge.

Précédemment dans Jericho ...
<i>On dirait que l'explosion venait de l'ouest,
peut-être de Denver.</i>
<i>Mais si c'était une attaque, que c'est le chaos dehors.</i>
<i>Vous ne voulez peut-être pas que les mauvaises
personnes sachent que Jericho est toujours là !</i>
<i>La mauvaise nouvelle, c'est qu'il y a eu
une autre explosion à Atlanta.</i>
<i>Plus que d'électricité ou de nourriture,
cette ville a besoin d'information.</i>
<i>On organise plusieurs groupes,
et on les envoie dans toutes les directions.</i>
<i>Shep et Gray devraient être revenu.</i>
<i>- C'est plutot cool, hein ?
- Ouais, surtout si on aime le maïs.</i>
<i>Viens, je te racompagne.</i>
<i>C'est pas trop bizarre de revenir chez toi
après si longtemps ?</i>
<i>Un peu.</i>
<i>Le grand Johnston Green terrassé par une grippe.</i>
<i>J'aimerai pouvoir faire plus pour lui.</i>
<i>Le train qui n'est jamais arrivé,</i>
<i>il a percuté une voiture,
et il y des tonnes de nourriture à l'intérieur.</i>
<i>Cet endroit était plein a craquer, jusqu'au plafond</i>
<i>- C'est pas bien difficile de savoir qui a tout pris.
- Arrête-toi tout de suite Mitchell !</i>
<i>Arrêtez, Shérif !</i>
<i>Tu sais qu'il va venir me chercher.
Et ensuite il en aura après toi.</i>
Où il est ?
Jonah ?
Que se passe-t-il, Pete ?
Mitchell s'est fait arréter.
Pour quelle raison ?
On a pris quelques chevaux,
tu sais, dans un des ranchs hors de la ville,
et Mitchell s'est fait prendre.
Et bien... Mitchell est un idiot.
Mais le truc c'est que...
le ranch où on était...
appartient à Johnston Green.
La femme du Maire a été un peu secouée.
Mais rien de bien méchant.
Mais... attends.
Attends un peu.
C'était l'idée de qui, la tienne ou la sienne ?
C'était la sienne.
Je suis désolé.
Je m'excuse.
Je m'excuse.
Excuses acceptées.
<i>Elle descend de la montagne, à cheval...</i>
<i>Elle descend de la montagne, à cheval...</i>
- Elle descend...
- Ca suffit, Mitchell.
Où est Jake ?
Tu ferais mieux d'aller le chercher,
parce que quand Jonah viendra pour moi,
il voudra avoir une petite
discussion avec Jake.
S'il doit aller le chercher
ça rendra les choses bien plus compliquées.
Peu importe.
Gardez-le simplement ici, d'accord ?
C'est mieux de lui dire de se tenir prêt.
En fait...
vous devriez tous vous tenir prêts.
Très bien.
Mallo Cups.
- C'est comme ça que ça s'appelait.
- Mon Dieu, comme j'adore ça.
- Les meilleurs.
- J'ai toujours eu plus de bonbons que toi, tu te souviens ?
Parce que tu trichais.
Pour Halloween, tu allais réclamer des bonbons
dans tout le quartier avec un déguisement,
puis tu recommençais avec un autre déguisement.
Allez, Eric, tout le monde le faisait.
Exact, sauf toi.
Pour Jake et moi, Halloween était tout un art.
C'était toujours moi qui faisais la clocharde, comme ça
je pouvais fourrer tous ses costumes dans mon sac poubelle.
Je pense que nous avons frappé à la porte des Stevens,
quelque chose comme sept fois la même année.
Il partageait toujours son butin avec moi, pourtant.
On était des petits Bonnie and Clyde.
C'était tellement adorable.
Ca te gêne si je continue
à te poser des questions à son sujet ?
Pourquoi ça me gênerait ?
Je ne sais pas.
As-tu le béguin pour Jake ?
Non...
- Ok, sauf, peut-être, oui, juste un petit peu.
- Un petit peu.
- Je suis désolée, c'est vraiment bizarre.
- Ce n'est pas bizarre.
Ecoute, ça fait longtemps.
Fais juste attention, ok ?
Pourquoi ?
Il y a beaucoup de choses que
tu ne sais pas à propos de Jake, ok ?
C'est la voiture de Jake ?
- Oh mon Dieu.
- Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- Je peux vous ai... der ?
- Je suis ici pour payer la caution d'un de mes amis.
Mitchell Cafferty.
Bonjour, Jonah.
Jake.
Ca faisait longtemps.

Cinq ans. Alors...
- Je crois comprendre que Mitchell a causé quelques problèmes.
- Allez, ne fais pas semblant d'être surpris.
Il n'y a pas un matin où il se lève sans parler de toi.
Je ne suis pas sûr que ce soit vrai...
Mais je suis ici pour payer sa caution.
Très bien, donc parlons caution.
- Premièrement, tu vas rendre tout ce que tu as volé...
- Attends un peu.
Je ne suis pas sûr que tu aies remarqué,
mais le monde est en train de s'écrouler.
Qui possède quoi devient très subjectif, Jake.
- Mais je verrai ce que je peux faire.
- Très bien, et ensuite tu resteras loin d'ici.
- Et pas que toi... Mitch, Joe Kelly...
- Depuis quand parles-tu au nom de la ville ?
- Marché conclu ?
- Tais-toi, Mitchell !
Marché conclu.
Oh, je vois que tu es réveillé.
It doit être midi.
Je suis debout depuis un moment.
Hey, ferme la porte de devant.
Quoi ? Tu es né dans une grange ?
Tu es né dans une grange ?
Ca fait presqu'une semaine que tu es ici et cette
blague n'en devient pas plus drôle.
J'ai trouvé des cornflakes rassis dans le garde-manger.
- Comme personne d'autre ne semble en manger...
- Et bien, lâche toi.
Voilà, tu veux y ajouter un peu de lait ?
Et voilà.
Oh...
C'est encore chaud.
Ouais, et c'était encore plus chaud quand
c'était dans la vache il y a dix minutes.
- J'en ai fini avec mes cornflakes.
- Hummm...
Tu as fait ça exprès, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
- Au fait, où est l'entonnoir ?
- Ah, oui.
Je l'ai mis dans le tiroir à bazar.
Je n'arrivais pas à dormir la nuit dernière,
donc j'ai réorganisé la cuisine.
J'ai mis tout les objets non essentiels hors du triangle.
- Le triangle ?
- L'espace de travail qui relie les trois endroits critiques...
évier, cuisinière et plan de travail.
J'étais en train de rénover mon appart à Washington
avant d'échouer ici.
Tu sais, Mimi,
quand j'étais un jeune garçon en pleine croissance,
j'avais toujours l'impression que
quelque chose manquait dans ma vie.
Maintenant je sais.
C'était le triangle.
Evier, cuisinière, plan de travail.
On sait aussi utiliser le sarcasme à Washington, tu sais.
Ça fera l'affaire, Bob.
- S'il te plait, dis-moi que c'est du soda light.
- Non, c'est du normal.
Il y avait toujours une caisse pleine de soda light ici.
Gracie m'avait promis de la garder pour moi.
Y'a pas de quoi t'inquiéter, chérie.
Je l'ai rangée une fois qu'on s'était mises d'accord sur le prix.
Oh, tu as raison.
- C'est adorable.
- C'est une antiquité.
Es-tu sûre de vouloir faire ça, mon coeur ?
J'en suis sûre.
Dale, il y a une caisse de soda cachée
le long du mur du fond, à côté de ton lit.
Tu veux bien aller la chercher, s'il te plaît ?
Tu dors toujours ici ?
Je reviens.
- Que fais-tu ?
- Quoi ?
- Tu étais en train de faire refroidir ton thermomètre
dans ce verre d'eau, non ?  - Pas du tout.
Très bien, et si c'était le cas ?
Je vais bien.
J'en ai assez d'être materné.
Tu as 150° de température.
Repose-toi.
Tu vas prendre les médicaments qu'April t'a donnés.
Tu vas admirer cette
citrouille ridicule avec moi
et ensuite nous allons essayer de
manger cette... citrouille ensemble.
Parce que dans cette maison on ne jette rien.
- C'est bien compris ?
- En gros, oui.
Mais plus de médicaments.
Ca fait trois semaines que j'en prends,
et je ne veux pas que cette ville
manque d'antibiotiques par ma faute.
Très bien, maintenant tu m'écoutes.
Il se pourrait qu'arrive un jour où cette
ville ait à nouveau besoin que tu sois son héros.
Mais ce ne sera pas aujoud'hui.
Le monde change.
Tu crois que je ne le sais pas ?
Il n'y a pas beaucoup de boulot pour un type qui
transporte des marchandises en camion en ce moment.
Ce qui n'était qu'un à côté
devient une sorte de boulot à plein-temps.
Nous pourrions avoir besoin d'un gars comme toi là-bas.
Il y a beaucoup de trucs qui traînent sur les routes
et qui n'attendent que d'être ramassées.
Je veux ta parole.
Toi et tes copains allaient rester
loin de cette ville.
J'ai déjà dit que je le ferai.
En demandant encore une fois, on pourrait penser
que tu me prends pour un menteur.
- Et voilà ma voiture.
- Et bien, tu l'avais laissée là-bas.
- Ouais mais elle a été détruite.
Elle a été restaurée avec amour.
Je t'ai dit qu'il y avait beaucoup de
bons trucs à ramasser là-bas sur les routes.
Pour celle-ci je n'ai même pas eu à me battre.
En plus, elle était à moi en premier.
Emily...
- Pourquoi tu lui parlais ?
- C'est bon, ok?
Ca n'avait rien à voir avec toi.
C'est mon père. Ca a tout à voir avec moi.
T'imagines pas comme j'étais mal
quand tu es parti.
Il appelait,
il était partout,
il venait à la maison,
il voulait me parler,
il voulait que je le pardonne pour
ce qui est arrivé à Chris.
Je ne lui pardonnerai jamais.
- Et maintenant, t'es de retour, lui aussi.
- Il n'est pas de retour.
D'accord ?
Après demain, il aura fini, il sera parti.
- Quand c'est supposé se passer ?
- Demain matin, à 11h00.
- Donc, on reprend la nourriture
et Prowse nous laisse tranquille ?
- C'est ce qu'il a dit.
- Ouais, on verra ce qu'il fera.
- De toute façon, je pense que
c'est important qu'on le fasse.
- Ok, je vais en parler à Papa.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Viens par là.
Gray Anderson est de retour.
<i>- Est-ce qu'il va bien ?
- J'arrive pas à y croire.</i>
Je suis... Merci.
Je suis monté dans un...
un camion de ravitaillement
de bouteilles d'eau
qui allait à un campement de la FEMA
près de Rogue River.
<i>La FEMA* s'organise ?
*FEMA: Federal Emergency Management Agency</i>
C'est déjà pas mal.
A 18 kms de Topeka,
on a rencontré un barrage routier.
Je veux dire, rien d'officiel,
juste deux voitures bloquant la route.
Et dès qu'on s'est arrêtés, il y a eu...
une douzaine de gars sortis de nulle part
qui nous ont arrachés du camion.
J'ai... assomé l'un d'eux et je suis barré en courant.
Le chauffeur...
ils l'ont frappé à mort et l'ont laissé par terre.
Ils l'ont tué juste pour...
quelques bouteilles d'eau.
Et vous, vous avez encore de l'électricité,
des lampes ou quelque chose ?
- Il y a eu une sacrée impulsion.
- Non.
Quelques circuits simples fonctionnent encore
comme les lampes de poches et
les rasoirs électriques, mais...
on a perdu pratiquement tout ce qui contient
un circuit électrique,
radio, ordinateurs,
les voitures récentes.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé à Topeka ?
- C'est le bordel.
Personne ne sait où est le gouverneur.
Et les retombées venant de Lawrence
les ont gravement touchés.
Hé, hé... Ils... Ils ont bombardé Lawrence ?
- Pourquoi Lawrence et pas Topeka ?
- J'en sais rien.
- Et les autres grandes villes ? New York, DC ?
- Oh, ils ont pas eu New York.
Quoi, New York s'en est sorti ?
Ouais, après le 11 septembre, ils ont
amélioré leur sécurité et apparemment,
la police de NY a attrapé trois gars
juste avant qu'ils pressent l'interrupteur.
Ils avaient un van de location,
une bombe de 20.000 tonnes
dans une caisse en acier.
Et Washington ?
En fumée.
Hé.
- T'as entendu ?
- Entendu quoi ?
M. Anderson est de retour.
Il dit que New York existe toujours.
New York ?
- Mes parents ?
- Peut-être qu'ils vont bien.
Mes parents.
Hé. T'en as mis du temps.
Ta soeur est allée se coucher
il y a un petit bout de temps.
Je suis quasiment sûre qu'elle
me déteste toujours autant.
Bien qu'elle m'ait enfin dit "Bonne nuit"
sans me faire ce signe.
Je me demande si elle sait
que je sais ce que ça veut dire.
J'ai des mauvaises nouvelles.
Mimi...
- Quoi ?
- Washington DC n'existe plus.
Tu sais, les remuer ne les rend pas meilleures.
Alors... Cindy Mather est morte ?
Si elle était à Washington...
alors probablement.
Ca dépend où elle était
quand la bombe a explosé.
Et Joel Stafford ?
Il voulait sortir avec moi.
C'est ce que disait Cindy.
Est-ce qu'ils ont senti quelque chose
quand ils sont morts ?
- Joel... Cindy, les Thompson d'à côté
- Ca, euh...
ça a été rapide.
- Et Doug.
- Qui est Doug ?
Le petit ami de maman.
Je pensais que tu le savais.
T'es devenu fou ?
T'as passé un marché avec Jonah Prowse ?
Ouais, Mitch contre la nourriture et
Jonah reste en dehors de Jericho. Pourquoi ?
- Parce que tu ne peux passer de marchés
avec des gars comme ça.
- Attends un peu, on en a parlé, on était d'accord.
Ecoute, je suis au courant pour Prowse.
Il transportait du matériel pour Stevens
avant que j'arrive à la mine.
Il piquait 5% de la marchandise,
en intimidant les fournisseurs.
Ce mec a fait 4 ans à Lansing pour
extorsion et agression.
Tu veux négocier avec ce type ?
Il marque un point, Jake.
- Et si on en parlait avec papa ?
- Ecoute, sans manquer de respect à ton père,
il était pas là dehors.
J'ai vu ce qu'il arrivait quand les gens
perdent tout ce qu'ils ont.
Tu commences par conclure un marché
avec les mauvais types, c'est le début de la fin.
Calme toi, d'accord ?
On a plus besoin de nourriture
que de garder Mitchell Cafferty.
Je suis supposé faire l'échange avec Jonah
dans une heure.
- Si j'y vais les mains vides,
je sais pas ce qu'il va faire.
- Ca n'a pas d'importance.
Parce qu'il saura qu'on retournera
pas le chercher.
Ecoute, Jake...
ce territoire nous appartient toujours ou non ?
Eric ?
Gray a raison.
Je sais que c'est seulement la moitié
des sodas que l'on a échangés
mais je dois vraiment récupérer cette boîte.
- Oh, désolée chérie.
On a fait un marché.
Je viens de découvrir que mes parents
sont peut-être en vie.
- Ils peuvent revenir n'importe quand.
- Oh, c'est une bonne nouvelle.
Je suis contente pour toi.
Cette boîte à bijoux appartenait à ma mère.
Sa grand-mère lui avait donné, c'est...
ça vaut beaucoup plus que quelques sodas light.
J'aurais aimé t'aider,
mais je l'ai déjà échangée.
- Avec qui ?
- Tous les échanges sont confidentiels.
Personne n'achète de boîte à bijoux
en demandant à qui elle appartenait.
Je suis sûre que tes parents comprendront.
Les temps sont durs pour nous tous.
Ok, très bien.
Dale, euh, est-ce que tu peux
enfermer ça à l'arrière, s'il te plait ?
- On dirait que t'as oublié quelqu'un.
- La ville a refusé l'échange avec Mitch.
Comment je peux arranger ça ?
Ooh !
Tu m'as fait peur.
Hey, c'est un gentil fantôme.
<i>Oh, c'est pour toi...</i>
Pas de bonbons ici les enfants.
Gray !
Gray !
Les hommes de Jonah viennent de libérer Mitchell.
Ils sont partis par devant.
Hey !
Hey !
Gray, non !
- Jake, on peut pas les laisser partir !
- Sinon quoi ? Tu préfères déclencher une fusillade en pleine rue ?
- Je dois les rattraper !
- T'as perdu la tête ?
- On doit réagir, Jake.
Quoi, tu penses qu'ils vont se calmer ?
- Je donne pas longtemps avant qu'ils reviennent.
- Je vais parler à Jonah.
- Tu veux parler à Jonah ? Vas le voir !
Il a respecté sa part du marché.
- Mais pourquoi tu défends ce type ?
- Je protège la ville.
- Il peut nous fournir ce qui nous manque.
- Quoi ?  - De la nouriture...
De l'essence, des munitions.
Si on en a besoin demain, tu peux en avoir ?
Tu peux ?
Lui, oui !
On va faire ça à ma façon maintenant.
Tu m'avais dit que tu pouvais m'avoir une voiture.
- Cette chose va me lacher à mi-chemin.
- Charlotte ? Non, elle est solide.
- Sois prudent.
- C'est à 15 kms seulement.
Avec lui, je voulais dire.
J'ai parlé à Emily.
Ah ouais ?
Qu'est-ce qu'elle t'a dit ?
Suffisamment.
Darcy, Allie et Sam font un barbecue dehors.
Ils font griller Spam, je pense.
Ils t'attendent.
Et...
Je sais pour Doug.
- Tu sais quoi ?
- Je pense qu'il a sûrement disparu.
Je sais...
- Je sais qu'il représentait beaucoup pour toi.
- Robby, tu ne sais rien du tout.
Est-ce que mes enfants le connaissent ?
- Pourquoi tu ne leur demandes pas ?
- Je ne veux pas leur demander, je...
Pourquoi es-tu venu ?
- Je t'ai dit que les enfants...
- Non, non. A Washington, tu aurais pu juste emmener les enfants.
On est restés bloqués 2 heures dans les
embouteillages ce jour là.
Tu n'avais pas besoin de m'attendre.
Pourquoi tu l'as fait ?
- Tu me détestais, Robbert.
- Non, je ne...  - Tu me détestais.
Tu m'en as voulu d'avoir annulé le mariage.
Et même après, tu as privilégié ton boulot
bien avant que je regarde un autre homme.
Je vais dire aux enfants que tu ne te sens pas très bien.
Je sors avec Doug depuis 3 mois.
Je l'ai rencontré à la gym.
J'ai aimé sa façon de me regarder.
Et j'ai aimé les sentiments que cela me procurait.
C'était agréable.
Je pensais le présenter aux enfants.
Et maintenant, je... je me retrouve ici avec
mes secrets et un homme qui me regarde...
comme ça.
Mon Dieu, Robert, pourquoi tu es revenu me chercher ?
Tu cours vite, Mitch.
Hé, arrêtez !
Laissez-le !
Arrêtez ça.
C'est bon, ça va.
Que me vaut le plaisir ?
A plusieurs personnes en ville qui ne
veulent pas en rester là.
Ils sont furieux.
Ils veulent venir ici et le récupérer,
par la force si besoin.
Qui aurait pu penser que quelqu'un
tienne autant à Mitchell Caferty ?
Ecoute, tu ne veux pas qu'on en arrive là,
et je ne veux pas qu'on en arrive là.
Je viens pour négocier.
La dernière fois qu'on a négocié,
ça ne m'a pas réussi.
Garde Mitch et la nourriture.
Tu peux vendre la nourriture à l'épicerie de Gracie Lee,
et pour ce dont tu as besoin, tu pourras prendre ta part.
eau, récolte,
le sel de la mine.
Continue.
En échange, tu garantis que tu mèneras tes...
affaires, loin de la ville.
On enverra un camion prendre la marchandise.
Ne viens pas en ville.
Je vais y réfléchir.
Maintenant parlons de ce dont j'ai besoin.
- Je veux parler à Emily.
- Elle ne veut pas te voir.
Elle m'en veut pour la mort de Chris.
- Tout pourrait être différent si elle savait qui est vraiment le coupable.
- Ce n'est pas moi qui l'ai envoyé faire ce boulot.
- J'ai essayé de l'en dissuader.
- Il lui fallait juste un soutien,
quelqu'un pour veiller sur ses arrières.
- Tu l'as laissé seul !
- Un soutien ?
Il avait besoin d'un père.
- Bon, il est peut-être temps qu'Emily apprenne la vérité.
- Je lui ai dit.
Je lui ai tout raconté.
- Elle t'a pardonné ?
- Non.
Moi non plus.
Dis-lui de venir me voir,
ou je mènerai mes affaires comme bon me semble.
- Je ne peux pas.
Alors considère qu'il n'y a pas de marché.
Ah, Eric, je peux te voir un instant ?
Bien sur. Qu'y a-t-il ?
Viens, rentre.
J'ai vu pas mal de visages inconnus par ici,
et je me suis un peu renseigné,
apparemment, il y a 8 nouvelles familles installées
depuis que j'ai quitté la ville, et 14 depuis les attaques.
Ouais, plusieurs familles ont hébergé des amis
venant des villes voisines.
- Beaucoup de gens du Colorado. Pourquoi ?
- On sait quelque chose sur eux ?
Ce qu'ils on fait, ce qu'ils savent ?
J'aime pas trop la tournure de cette discussion, Gray.
Et bien, moi non plus,
mais je suis sûr qu'on ne sera jamais trop prudent.
Tu veux parler de Robert Hawkins ?
Il a deux enfants.
Et il nous a beaucoup aidés.
Il est arrivé 2 jours après la catastrophe, avec assez
d'argent pour acheter la maison des Thompson.
Ecoute, je n'affirme rien.
Je... Je pense juste qu'on devrait en savoir un peu plus
sur les gens avec qui on partage ce trou à rat.
Ça nous coûte rien de demander.
Tu ne voudrais pas me parler de quelque chose ?
Que voulez-vous dire ?
La boîte à bijoux a disparu.
Est-ce que tu l'as volée, Dale ?
Dis quelque chose.
Pourquoi lui avez-vous menti ?
- Pourquoi vous lui avez dit que vous n'aviez plus la boîte ?
- On avait fait un échange honnête.
Je n'ai pas besoin de m'expliquer avec cette garce.
- Vous ne la connaissez pas.
- Je connais bien les gens de son espèce.
Ils pensent que les règles ne les concernent pas.
Je pourrais comprendre que les
autres essayent de me voler,
mais après tout ce que j'ai fait pour toi ?
- Tout ce que vous avez fait pour moi ?
- Je t'ai engagé.  - Et après ?
Vous me laissez dormir ici ?
C'est moi qui ai trouvé le train.
C'est moi qui me suis tapé 8 kms tous les jours
pour rapporter la nourriture.
Vous n'auriez plus de magasin si je n'étais pas là.
- Dale, chéri...
- Vous savez quoi ? C'est fini.
Voilà vos clés.
Dale, non !
Salut.
Où est Mary ?
On est mercredi, c'est son jour de congé.
- Qu'est ce que tu bois là ?
- Je sais pas.
Ca pourrait bien être du kérosène.
J'ai pas encore trouvé ce que c'était.
Comment ça s'est passé avec Jonah aujourd'hui ?
Je crois qu'on est parti dans un affrontement
qu'on aurait bien aimé éviter.
Super.
Et toi ? Ta journée ?
Et bien, je crois que je suis en train de devenir
le gentil toutou de Gray Anderson.
Le pire c'est que je suis même pas sûr
que ce soit une mauvaise chose.
Super journée pour les frères Green, hein ?
- Ouais. Tu évites de rentrer à la maison à cause de papa ?
- Putain ouais. Et toi ?  - Pareil.
Ouais. Tu te rappelles du jour où on a
mis le feu au tapis de son bureau ?
Tout ce que tu avais à faire c'était de suivre notre plan,
et on s'en serait tirés.
- Tu voulais que je dise à papa que j'avais eu une crise,
et que j'avais renversé sa lampe de bureau.  - Ouais.
T'as pas une autre idée brillante pour nous
tirer de ce mauvais pas là ?
Pas pour le moment.
Et bien, je suggère qu'on finisse nos verres,
qu'on rentre à la maison et qu'on essaye d'expliquer
tout ça à papa, sans que ça le tue.
Je pense que tu as assez bu.
Tu veux m'accompagner...
pour qu'on puisse finir notre conversation ?
- Non, j'ai suffisamment parlé aujourd'hui, Rob.
- Je ne plaisante pas, Darcy.
- Allons-y.
- Je t'ai dit non... pas cette fois.
Pourquoi tu rentres pas ?
Hé...
Je suis revenu te chercher parce que tu es ma femme.
Je ne sais pas si tu aimes la soupe de tomate.
Je ne sais pas pour toi,
mais moi en général ça me fait du bien, alors...
Ca donne quoi ?
Je viens de consulter tous mes dossiers en attente
et je n'arrive pas à me souvenir de la moitié des cas.
Cette pile c'est "presque clos" et celle-là,
c'est "pas prêts d'être finis".
- Tu n'as pas à faire tout ça.
- Qu'est-ce que je pourrais bien faire d'autre ?
Oh !
Oh !
Laisse-moi.
- J'essaye seulement de t'aider.
- Et bien, arrête.
Ecoute, je sais ce que tu traverses.
Tu m'entends ?
J'ai perdu mes parents quand j'avais 18 ans,
et les premiers jours étaient vraiment durs.
Tout ce que j'aimais est parti en fumée il y a un mois.
Et tu te permets de me dire que tu sais ce que je ressens ?
- J'essaye d'être gentil avec toi.
- Et bien, cesse d'être gentil avec moi !
Tu ne me dois rien.
Tu ne dois plus rien à personne.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je suis venue pour te parler,
mais quand je suis arrivée...
- Dépêchez-vous.
- Quoi.  - Allez dépêchez vous.
Il est en état de choc ou je sais pas quoi.
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq...
1001... 1002... 1003... 1004... 1005.
- Il ne respire plus.
- Allez, encore une fois.
Mettons-le sur le côté. Allez.
Je lui ai donné trois séries d'antibiotique.
Son corps n'a pas dû le supporter.
Il risque l'infection.
Comment ça se soigne ?
Un instant, April. Comment ça se soigne ?
Si le centre médical était opérationnel, peut-être.
Si on pouvait l'évacuer vers l'hôpital du Comté
à Rogue River, peut-être.
S'il nous restait des médicaments plus
puissants à la pharmacie, peut-être.
Sans ça...
12 heures.
Peut-être une journée.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Quelle sorte de médicaments ?
Quoi ?
Tu a dit qu'il avait besoin de médicaments puissants.
De quoi... de quoi a-t-il besoin ?
Quelque chose capable de combattre rapidement l'infection.
Que son corps combatte de lui-même.
Du Cipro sans doute, mais ça fait des semaines qu'on n'en a plus.
- Ils en ont à Rogue City, pourtant.
- Jake.
C'est à 150 kms d'ici !
- Je ferais mieux de partir tout de suite, alors.
- Attends.
Je viens aussi.
Eric, non.
Si Gray a raison à propos des dangers...
Vas-y.
Vas-y tout de suite.
Tu voulais parler.
Alors parlons.
- Tu veux t'asseoir ?
- Non, je ne suis pas là pour rattraper le temps perdu.
Le père de Jake Green est malade.
- Ah bon ?
- Oui.
Je me contrefous de ce que tu
penses de lui, d'accord ?
Je suis là pour te demander de m'aider.
Je ne suis pas médecin, chérie.
Non, en effet.
Tu es un voleur.
- Il a besoin de médicaments, du Cipro.
- J'en ai pas. Désolé.
Mais je peux peut-être t'aider.
- Tu as la même expression que ta mère.
- Arrête.
Ne me parle pas d'elle, ni de Chris. D'accord ?
Il paraît que tu vas te marier ?
C'est quel genre de type ?
- A combien de questions je vais devoir répondre
pour que tu m'aides ?  - Plus que ça.
- Il fait quoi, ton type ?
- Il est conseiller financier.
Emily.
J'ai respecté notre accord, je suis resté loin de toi.
Mais ces dernières semaines,
j'ai vu pas mal de sales choses.
Je veux juste m'assurer que quelqu'un veille sur toi.
Il ne reste plus que toi et moi maintenant.
Ta mère n'est plus là.
- Chris n'est plus là.
- On en est arrivés là ?
- Hein ?
- Quoi ?
Tu veux qu'on soit de nouveau une famille ?
Tu veux que quelqu'un t'invite pour Thanksgiving ?
Si tu penses une seule seconde
que c'est ce que je souhaite, tu rêves.
Je pense que pour quelqu'un qui me demande de l'aide,
tu as une drôle de manière de le faire, jeune fille.
Je vais t'aider.
Tu es ma fille.
Mais je pense que tous les deux,
on devrait plus se voir.
Dale.
- Où étais-tu ?
- Je t'ai cherché partout.
Comment as-tu eu ça ?
Merci.
Mon dieu, c'est pour ça que vous vous êtes disputés ?
Tu dors où ce soir ?
Chez un copain.
Chez un copain ?
Viens.
Tu peux dormir chez moi, sur le canapé.
- Je ne pense pas que ce soit une bonne idée.
- Je n'ai pas le choix.
Alors laisse-moi au moins réparer quelques trucs.
On n'a pas le temps.
- Faut que j'y aille maintenant.
- Quoi ? Attends ?
- Tu as dit qu'elle était solide.
- Solide, oui, si tu dois semer quelqu'un ?
- Pourquoi ? Elle monte à combien ?
- J'en sais rien.
50, peut-être 60 km/h, au mieux,
en descente, et pas pour très longtemps.
Ecoute, à mon avis, peut-être que tu devrais y aller à cheval.
- Un cheval est plus lent que ça.
- Un cheval risque moins d'exploser.
Je prends le risque.
Très bien, alors au moins ménage-la.
Garde un peu de puissance en réserve
au cas où tu en aurais besoin subitement.
et souviens-toi que le réservoir est sur la gauche.
donc si quelqu'un décide de te tirer dessus,
essaye de choisir le bon côté !
Rien d'autre ?
Reviens en un seul morceau.
Je le ferai, promis.
Je pensais que tu y allais.
J'attends Eric.
Oh.
Mmm...
- Fais gaffe aux géants irradiés là-bas!
- Comme toujours.
D'accord.
Tu vas quelque part ?
Oui, mon père a besoin de médicaments,
des trucs qu'on n'a pas ici.
Jake et moi on va à Rogue River
pour essayer d'en trouver.
Tu es sûr que c'est une bonne idée ?
Pas vraiment.
Ecoute, soyez prudent là-bas, d'accord ?
Vous ne...
Vous ne vous arrêtez pour rien au monde,
vous ne ralentissez même pas.
Je suis sérieux.
On sera de retour d'ici demain matin.
Tu pourrais garder un oeil sur ce qui se passe ici ?
Oui bien sûr, t'inquiète pas.
Ho, c'est quoi ce bordel ?
On doit rouler avec ça ?
Oui, je veux dire, ce n'est pas vraiment...
Ouais.
C'est quoi ça ?
Je pensais que le marché c'était qu'on
récupère la nourriture et que lui reste loin d'ici.
C'était bien ça.
Em ?
Je n'ai pas pu trouver les médicaments,
alors j'ai pris ce qu'il y avait de mieux.
Une voiture rapide.
Il m'a dit que c'était un cadeau.
Tu sais qu'avec lui, il n'y a jamais de cadeaux.
Je suis vraiment désolé que tu sois mêlée à tout ça.
Personne ne m'a forcé.
Va sauver ton père.
Eric ? On charge.

Jonah?
What's the problem, Pete?
Mitchell got arrested.
What for?
Well, we grabbed a couple horses
you know, from one of those ranches
outside of town and Mitchell got caught.
Well... Mitchell is an idiot.
But the thing is...
the ranch that we were at,
it belonged to Johnston Green.
The mayor's wife kind of got
knocked around a little bit.
Not bad, though. Nothing bad.
But... wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Who's idea was it, yours or his?
It was his.
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
I apologize.
Apology accepted.
She'll be coming 'round
the mountain when she comes
She'll be coming 'round
the mountain when she comes
- She'll be coming 'round...
- Knock it off, Mitchell.
Where's Jake?
You better go get him,
'cause when Jonah comes for me,
he's gonna want to have a little
conversation with Jake.
If he has to go looking for him
it's going to make things a whole lot worse.
Whatever.
Just keep it down in here, all right?
Better tell him to get ready.
In fact...
you all better get ready.
Right.
Mallo Cups.
- That's what they were called.
- God, I love those.
- The best.
- I always got so much more
candy than you, remember?
'Cause you cheated.
You'd trick or treat the whole
neighborhood in one costume,
then you'd go do it again in another.
Come on, Eric, everybody did that.
Well, except for you.
Jake and I had Halloween down to a science.
I was always the bag lady so I could stuff
all of his costumes into my garbage bad.
I think we hit the Stevens' house,
like, seven times in one year.
He did always share his haul with me, though.
Just like a little Bonnie and Clyde.
So adorable.
Is it inappropriate that I keep
asking questions about him?
Why would it be inappropriate?
I don't know.
Do you have a thing for Jake?
No...
- Okay, except, maybe, yes,
just a little bit. - A little.
- I'm sorry, this is really weird.
- It's not weird.
Look, it was a long time ago.
Just be careful, okay?
Why?
There's a lot of things about
Jake you don't know, okay?
Is that Jake's car?
- Oh, my God.
- What?
What is it?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Can I help... you?
- I'm here to see about posting
bail for a friend of mine.
Mitchell Cafferty.
Hello, Jonah.
Jake.
Been a long time.
5 years. So...
- I understand Mitchell's been causing some
trouble. - Come on, don't act surprised.
He doesn't get out of bed in the morning
without running it by you first.
I'm not sure that's true,
but I'm here to bail him out.
All right, then let's talk bail.
- First you're going to give back
the food you stole...
- Wait, hold on a second.
I'm not sure you've noticed,
but the world's coming apart at the seams.
What belongs to who is getting
to be a fuzzy science, Jake.
- But I'll see what I can do.
- All right, and then you're
gonna stay away from this place.
- Not just you-- Mitch, Joe Kelly...
- Since when are you in a position
to speak for this town?
- Do we have a deal?
- Shut up, Mitchell!
We have a deal.
Oh, I see you're awake.
Must be noon.
I've been up for a while.
Hey, close the front door.
What, were you born in a barn?
Were you born in a barn?
Almost a week you've been here and that
joke's really not getting any funnier.
Found some stale corn flakes in the pantry.
- Since no one else seemed to be eating
them... - Well, knock yourself out.
Here, you want a little milk with those?
There you go.
Oh...
It's still warm.
Yeah, it was even warmer when it
was in the cow ten minutes ago.
- And that will do it for the corn flakes.
- Mm...
You did that on purpose, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
- By the way, where's the funnel?
- Oh, yeah.
I put it in the random drawer.
I couldn't sleep last night, so I rearranged
some kitchen space
put all the non-essentials
out of the triangle.
- Triangle? - The workspace that
connects the three critical areas--
sink, stove and prep.
I was in the process of
having my condo in D.C.
renovated before I got stranded here.
You know, Mimi,
when I was a young boy growing up,
I always felt like there was something
missing in my life.
Now I know.
It was the triangle.
Sink, stove, prep.
We have sarcasm in D.C., you know.
These'll do, Bob.
Please tell me that's diet Cream soda.
There used to be a whole case of diet here.
Gracie promised she'd hold on to it for me.
Not to worry, dear.
I tucked it away when
we agreed on the price.
Oh, you're right.
- It's lovely.
- It's an antique.
Are you sure about this, sweetheart?
I'm sure.
Dale, there's a case of soda hidden
along the back wall next to your cot.
Would you bring it up, please?
You're still sleeping here?
Be right back.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- You were cooling your thermometer
in that glass of water, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't.
All right, so what if I was?
I'm fine. I'm tired of being babied.
You have a temperature of 350 degrees.
You are going to rest.
You are going to take
the pills that April gave you.
You are going to admire this
ridiculous pumpkin with me
and then we are going to try to eat said
pumpkin together.
Because we use every part
of the buffalo in this house.
- Is that understood?
- Most of it.
But no more meds.
It's been three weeks,
I'm not going to be the reason
this town runs clean out of antibiotics.
All right, now you listen to me.
There may come a day when this
town needs you to be a hero again
but today is not that day.
The world's changing.
Don't I know it.
Not a lot of work for a guy
hauling freight these days.
The old side business has sort of become
a full time gig.
We could use a guy like you out there.
There's a lot of stuff out on the roads
waiting for anybody to take it.
I want your word.
You and your guys are going
to stay away from town.
Already said I would.
Ask again, a guy might think
you were calling him a liar.
- And that's my car.
- Well, you left it out there.
- Yeah, but it was destroyed.
Lovingly restored.
I told you there was a lot of good stuff
out there on the roads.
This one I didn't even have to fight for.
Besides, she was mine first.
Emily...
- Why are you talking to him?
- It's okay, all right?
It didn't have anything to do with you.
He's my father.
It has everything to do with me.
You have no idea how bad
it got after you left.
He was calling.
He was everywhere.
He was coming by the house.
He wanted to talk to me.
He wanted me to forgive him
for what happened with Chris.
I will never forgive him
for what happened to Chris.
- And now you're back and he's back.
- Oh, he's not back.
All right?
After tomorrow, he's done, he's gone.
- When's it supposed to happen?
- Tomorrow morning at 11:00.
- So, we get the food back
and Prowse leaves us alone.
- Well, that's what he said.
- Yeah, we'll see what he does.
- Either way, I think it's
important that we do this.
- Okay. I'll run it by Dad.
- What's going on?
Get in here.
Gray Anderson's back in town.
- Is he okay?
- I can't believe it.
I hitched... Oh, thank you.
I hitched a ride with a...
with a supply truck that was running
bottled water to a FEMA camp
out near Rogue River.
FEMA's running.
Well, that's good, at least.
Well, about ten miles outside of
Topeka, we hit a roadblock.
I mean, nothing official, just a couple
cars rolled out onto the highway.
And as soon as we stopped, it was like...
like a dozen guys just came out of nowhere
and yanked us out of the truck.
I... fought one of them
and took off on foot.
The driver...
they just beat him to
death right on the road.
They killed him for...
just a few cases of water.
You guys have any electricity
yet, any lights or anything?
- There was a heck of a pulse.
- No.
Some simple circuits are still working
like flashlights and
electrical razors, but...
we pretty much lost everything
with a circuit board--
radio, computers,
newer cars.
- What's happening in Topeka?
- It's a mess.
Nobody knows where the hell the governor is.
And the fallout from Lawrence
hit 'em really hard.
Whoa, whoa... They... They hit Lawrence?
- Wh-Why would they hit Lawrence
and not Topeka? - I don't know.
- What about any other major cities?
New York, DC...?
- Oh, they didn't get New York.
What, New York made it?
Yeah, well, after 9/11, they got pretty good
at security and apparently,
NYPD caught three guys
right before they flipped the switch.
They had a rented van,
a 20-kiloton bomb in a steel drum.
And what about DC?
It's gone.
Hey.
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?
Mr. Anderson's back.
He says New York is still there.
New York?
- My parents?
- They might be okay.
My parents.
Hey. Took you long enough.
Your sister went to bed a little while ago.
I'm pretty sure that she still hates me.
Although tonight was the first
time she said "good night"
without the dirty sign mixed in.
I wonder if she knows that I
know what that means.
I have some bad news.
Mimi...
- What?
- Washington DC's gone.
You know, stirring them doesn't
make them taste any better.
So... Cindy Mather is dead?
If she was in DC...
then probably.
It depends how close she was
when the bomb went off.
And Joel Stafford?
He's gonna ask me out.
That's what Cindy said.
Did they feel it when they died?
- Joel... Cindy, the Thompsons
next door... - It, um...
it would've been fast.
- And Doug.
- Who's Doug?
Mom's boyfriend.
I thought you knew.
Are you out of your mind?
You made a deal with Jonah Prowse?
Yeah, Mitch for the food and
Jonah stays out of Jericho. Why?
- Because you can't make deals with
guys like that. - Wait a minute,
we talked about this. We-We agreed.
Look, I know about Prowse.
He hauled materials for Stevens
before I came into the mine.
He was stealing five percent off
the top, intimidating suppliers.
The guy did four years at Lansing for
extortion and assault.
You want to negotiate with that guy?
He's got a good point, Jake.
- What happened to clearing this with Dad?
- Look, no disrespect to your father,
but he hasn't been out there.
I've seen what happens when people
lose their hold on law and order.
You start striking bargains with the
bad guys, it's the beginning of the end.
Just calm down, all right?
We need food more than we need to keep
Mitchell Cafferty.
Now, I'm supposed to make a trade with
Jonah in an hour.
- If I go out there empty-handed, I don't
know what he's gonna do.
- It doesn't matter.
Because he'll know that we won't
roll over for him.
Look, Jake...
we either hold this territory or we don't.
Eric?
Gray's right.
I know this is only half
the soda we swapped for
- but I really need that jewelry box back.
- Oh, sorry, sweetie.
We made a deal.
I just found out my parents could be alive.
- They might be coming home at any time.
- Oh, that's good news.
I'm happy for you.
That jewelry box belonged to my mother.
Her grandmother gave it to her, it's...
it's worth a lot more than some diet soda.
I wish I could help you,
but I already traded it away.
- To who?
- All trades are confidential.
No one wants to buy a jewelry box that comes
with an argument about who it belongs to.
I'm sure that your parents will understand.
These are hard times for all of us.
Okay, fine.
Dale, um, could you lock
this up in the back, please?
- Looks like you forgot someone.
- The town said no to the deal with Mitch.
How can I fix this?
Ooh!
You scared me.
Hey, that's a good ghost.
Oh, that's for you...
No candy in here, guys.
Gray!
Gray!
Jonah's men just took Mitchell.
They're headed out the front.
Hey!
Hey!
Gray, no!
- Instead of what? Starting a
firefight on Main Street?
- I got to go out after them!
- Are you out of your mind?
- This has got to be answered, Jake.
What, are you gonna turn the other cheek?
- How long before you think these guys
are back...? - I can talk to Jonah.
- You can talk to Jonah... Find him!
He lived up to his end of the deal.
- And why the hell are you protecting
this guy? - I'm protecting this town.
- He can get things we're gonna need.
- What can he get?!
- He can get food!
He can get gas, he can get ammo.
Could you get that stuff
if we needed it tomorrow?
Could you?!
Because he can!
We'll do this my way now.
You said you could get me a car.
- Is this thing gonna die on me
halfway out there? - Charlotte?
Not a chance. She's sturdy.
- So, uh, be careful.
- I'm only going ten miles.
I meant with him.
I talked to Emily.
Yeah? What'd she tell you?
Enough.
Hey, Darcy,
Allie and Sam got a grill going outside.
I think we're barbecuing Spam.
They were asking for you.
So, uh...
I know about Doug.
- What do you know?
- I know that he's probably gone.
I know...
- I know that he meant a lot to you.
- Robby, you don't know a damn thing.
So are my kids close to him?
- Why don't you ask the kids?
- I don't want to ask the kids.
I'm ask...
Why did you come for me?
- I told you the kids...
- No, no. In D.C., you could have
just taken the kids.
We sat in traffic for two hours
that afternoon on the Beltway.
- You didn't have to wait
for me. Why'd you do it?
- Why?
- You hated me, Robert.
- I did not...
- You hated me.
You blamed me for breaking up the marriage.
And even though you left me for your work
long before I ever looked at another man.
I'll tell the kids you're
not feeling too well.
Doug and I had been dating
for about three months.
I met him at the gym.
I liked the way he looked at me.
And I liked the way that I felt
about myself when he looked at me.
It was nice.
I was thinking about
introducing him to the kids.
Now I'm, I'm back in the house of secrets
with a man who looks at me like...
like that.
God, Robert,
why on Earth did you come for me?
Quite the runner, Mitch.
Hey, knock it off!
Let him go!
Break it up. Break it up.
All right, it's all right.
To what do I owe this pleasure
A lot of people in town
who aren't going to let this stand.
They're angry.
They're talking about coming out here
to get him by force if necessary.
Did you ever in your life think anyone would
care this much about Mitchell Cafferty?
Look, you don't want it to come to that,
I don't want it to come to that.
I'm here to negotiate.
Last time we negotiated,
it didn't work out so good for me.
Keep Mitch and keep the food.
You can sell the food to the town through
Gracie Lee's market
and take your cut off the top in supplies
that we have and you don't:
fresh water, crops,
salt from the mine.
I'm listening.
In exchange, you'll guarantee that your...
your business stays away from town.
We'll send a trailer to pick up supplies.
You don't come to us.
I'll think about it.
Now let's talk about what I need.
- I want to talk to Emily.
- She doesn't want to see you.
She blames me for Chris's death.
- Things might be different if she knew
whose fault it really was. - I didn't
sent him on that job, all right? You did.
I tried to talk him out of it.
He needed a lookout,
someone to watch his back.
- You left him alone!
- A lookout?
He needed a father.
- All right. Maybe it is time
Emily learns the truth about what you did.
- I told her.
I told her, I told her everything.
- Did she forgive you?
- No.
Neither do I.
Get her to see me,
- or I'll do business wherever
the hell I please. - I can't.
Then I guess we don't have a deal.
Oh, hey, Eric,
can I borrow you for a minute?
Sure. What's up?
Come on in. I, uh...
I am seeing a lot of
unfamiliar faces around here
and I did some asking around,
and apparently, there are eight new families
since I left town and 14 since the attacks.
Yeah, some families had relatives come
from nearby towns.
- A few more people from Colorado. Why?
- Do we know anything about them?
Where they've been, what they know?
I don't think I like where this
conversation's going, Gray.
Well, neither do I,
but I'm also sure that we can't
be too careful or too prepared.
You mean Robert Hawkins?
The man has two kids.
He's been nothing but helpful.
He shows up two days before the end
of the world with enough cash to buy
the old Thompson house.
Look, I'm not suggesting anything.
I'm-I'm just saying that we should
know a little more about who
we're sharing our foxhole with.
It costs us nothing to find out.
Is there something you want to tell me?
What do you mean?
That jewelry box is missing.
Did you steal from me, Dale?
Say something.
Why did you lie to her?
- Why did you tell her you didn't
have the box? - We made a fair trade.
I shouldn't have to explain myself
to some spoiled little girl.
- You don't know her.
- Oh, I know her and everybody like her.
They think the rules don't apply to them.
I could understand others
trying to steal from me
but after everything I have done for you?
- Everything you've done for me?
- I took you in.
- -And what?
You let me sleep here?
I was the one who looked for the train.
I was the one who walked five miles
every day dragging food back here.
You wouldn't have a store
if it wasn't for me.
- Dale, honey...
- You know what?
No, I'm done.
Here's your keys back.
Dale, no!
Hey.
Where's Mary?
Uh, Wednesday, night off.
- What are you drinking there?
- I don't know.
I think it might be kerosene.
I haven't quite figured out the still yet.
So how'd things go with Jonah today?
I think I might have gotten us into a fight
we don't want to be a part of.
Nice.
How about you?
How was your day?
Well, I think I'm becoming
Graynderson's yes man.
The worst part of it is I'm
not sure if that's a bad thing.
Big day for the Green boys, huh?
- Yeah. You avoiding going home telling Dad?
- Hell, yeah. You?
- Same.
Yeah. You remember that time we set
the carpet in Dad's office on fire?
All you had to do was stick to the story,
we would have been fine.
- You wanted me to tell Dad I had a seizure
and knocked over his desk lamp.
- Yeah.
Any other brilliant ideas
to get us out of this one?
Not at the moment.
Well, I say we finish these drinks
go home and try to explain all this to Dad
in a way that won't kill him.
I think you've had enough to drink.
You want to come with me
so we can finish our conversation?
- No, I'm done talking for the day, Rob.
- I'm not kidding, Darcy.
- Let's just go.
- No, all right?
- Not this time.
Why don't you go home?
Hey...
I came back for you
because you are my wife.
Hey, uh, I'm not sure how you feel about
tomato soup
but I don't know.
It usually makes me feel better, so...
How's it coming?
I've been going over
all of my pending audits
and I can only remember half the details
of half my cases.
This one is for "almost there," and
this one is for "not even close."
- You don't need to be doing all this.
- What the hell else am I going to do?
Oh!
Oh!
Get out of my way.
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Well, stop it.
Look, I know what you're going through.
All right? I lost my folks
when I was 18 years old,
and the first few days were, were bad.
Everything and everyone that I ever cared
about was incinerated four weeks ago.
And you mean to tell me
that you know how I feel?
- I'm trying to be nice to you.
- Well, stop being nice to me!
You don't owe me anything.
You don't owe anyone anything anymore.
Em. What are you doing here?
I came here to talk to you,
but when I got here...
- Hurry.
- What?
- Hurry.
He went into shock or something.
And one, and two, three, four. Five...
1,001... 1,002... 1,003...
1,004... 1,005.
- He's not breathing.
- Okay, one more breath.
Let's get him over on his side. Come on.
I've given him three courses of antibiotics.
It must have been too much for his system.
He's become septic.
How do we treat it?
Wait a minute, April.
How do we treat it?
If the Med Center were operational-- maybe.
If we could MEDEVAC him into County Hospital
in Rogue River, maybe.
If we had any heavy-duty meds
left in the pharmacy, maybe.
Without that...
12 hours.
Maybe a day.
I'm so sorry.
What kind of meds?
What?
You said he needed heavy-duty meds.
What, what kind would he need?
Something strong enough to blow out the
infection fast.
Let his body heal itself.
Cipro, probably, but we ran out weeks ago.
- They'd have it in Rogue River, though.
- Jake.
That's 90 miles away.
- I'd better get going, then.
- Wait a minute.
I'm going, too.
Eric. no.
If Gray's right about how dangerous...
Go.
Go now.
You wanted to talk.
Let's talk.
- You want to sit?
- No. I'm not here to catch up.
Jake Green's dad's sick.
- That so?
- Yeah.
I don't care what you think of him, okay?
I'm here to ask for your help.
I'm not a doctor, sweetheart.
No, you're not.
You're a thief.
- He needs meds.
He needs Cipro.
- Don't have it. Sorry.
But I may be able to help.
- Your mother used to make that same face.
- Stop it.
You do not get to talk
about her. Or Chris. Okay?
I heard you're getting married.
What kind of guy is he?
- How many questions do I have to
answer to get your help? - More.
- What's he do? The guy.
- He's an investment banker.
Emily.
I've stuck by our agreement to stay away.
But the past few weeks,
I've seen a lot of bad things.
I just want to know
somebody's looking out for you.
It's just you and me now.
Your mom's gone.
- Chris is gone.
- Is that what this is?
- Hmm?
- What?
You want us to be a family?
Want somebody to invite
you for Thanksgiving dinner?
If you think for one second
that I would do that again, you're crazy.
I think if you want my help
saving Johnston Green's life,
you got a funny way of asking, young lady.
You're gonna get my help.
You're my kid.
But I think you and I need to
start seeing more of each other.
Dale.
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
How did you get this?
Thank you.
My God, this is what the fight was about.
Where are you staying tonight?
Ah... A friend's house.
A friend's house?
Come on.
You can sleep on the couch at my place.
- I don't think this is such a good idea.
- No choice.
Well, then at least let me do
some work on the car.
There's no time.
- I have to go now.
- What? Wait.
- You said it was sturdy.
- Well, sturdy, yeah, but what if
you need to outrun something?
- Why? How fast will it go?
- I don't know.
30, maybe 40 miles an hour, best
case, downhill, and not for very long.
See, this is what I'm saying. Maybe
you should go on horseback.
- A horse is slower than that.
- A horse is less likely to explode.
I'll take my chances.
Okay, well, then, at least open her up easy.
Make sure you have enough car left
in case you need to ask for a lot in a hurry
and remember, the gas tank on this thing
is on the left-hand side
so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you
make sure it's not on that side.
Anything else?
Come back in one piece.
I will, I promise.
I thought you were gonna go.
I'm waiting on Eric.
Oh.
Um...
- Watch out for giant irradiated
hands out there. - Always do.
Okay.
You going somewhere?
Yeah, my father needs
medication, stuff we don't have in town.
Jake and I are going to
Rogue River to find it.
You sure that's a good idea?
Not really.
Listen, you be careful out
there, all right? You don't...
you don't stop for anything,
you don't even slow down.
I mean it.
We'll be back before morning.
Do you mind keeping an eye on things here?
Of course, yeah, don't worry about it.
Aw, what the hell?
This is what we're driving?
Yeah, I mean, it's not actually a...
Yeah.
What in the world?
I thought the deal was we'd go get the food
and he'd stay away.
It was.
Em?
I couldn't get you the meds you needed, so
I got you the second-best thing.
A fast car.
He said it's a gift.
You know there are no gifts with him.
I'm really sorry you got dragged into this.
Nobody dragged me.
Go save your dad.
Eric? Load up.
1 MOIS APRČS LES BOMBES
Jake...
J'ai vu.
Ralentis !
On ne s'arręte pas tant qu'on
n'a pas atteint Rogue River.
Tu peux pas la laisser au bord
de la route comme įa !
Tu vois les autres
traces de freinage derričre ?
On l'a forcé ā sortir de la route,
probablement pour la voler et la tuer.
Ils pourraient ętre en train d'attendre
pour recommencer.
Je n'aime pas įa plus que toi, mais
si nous n'y arrivons pas, papa mourra.
C'est le monde dans lequel
on vit maintenant.
Oui, c'est pręt...
Oh, non, chéri, attention,
mon coeur, c'est chaud !
Waouh, je n'arrive pas ā croire
que įa ait marché, m'man !
Oui, votre pčre est un
homme vraiment intelligent.
Je vais le chercher ?
Non, chérie, il travaille...
En plus, il faut que įa refroidisse.
<i>Bonjour !</i>
<i>Mme Hawkins, cela vous dérange-t-il
si nous entrons quelques minutes ?</i>
Gray Anderson et Jimmy veulent te voir.
Ils ont dit ā quel sujet ?
Non.
Mais je n'ai pas l'impression que ce soit
une simple visite de courtoisie.
D'accord.
Bon, j'ai trouvé la route pour aller ā
l'Hôpital du Comté de Rogue River.
- Prends "Cedar Run Road"...
- Non, pas įa.
Tu ne sais męme pas
ce que j'allais dire !
Oublie la carte, on prend
les routes secondaires.
Jake, papa n'attendra pas...
On doit prendre les médicaments et...
J'ai passé toute mon adolescence
sur ces routes.
On ne perdra pas de temps.
Tu penses toujours avoir raison.
Ces trucs sont chargés ?
Oui, ils sont chargés !
Qu'allons-nous devoir faire, Jake ?
Je ne sais pas, mais quand
viendra le moment de le faire...
Je serai pręt.

T'as rien dit depuis des
kilomčtres, reste vigilant.
Que t'est-il arrivé,  Jake ?
- Que veux-tu dire ?
- Ces cinq derničres années ?
Oų étais-tu ?
En prison, je suppose...
- Pourquoi tu ne veux rien dire ?
- Qu'est-ce que įa peut faire ?
Parce que durant tout ce temps,
j'étais lā ā regarder maman et papa souffrir.
Chaque fois que le téléphone
sonnait, ils pensaient que c'était toi !
Je détestais téléphoner chez eux,
parce qu'on a la męme voix au téléphone.
Je ne pouvais plus les écouter,
réalisant que ce n'était que moi !
Je suis désolé, d'accord ?
Je suis désolé...
pour ce que j'ai fait ā notre famille...
mais ne me prends pas comme excuse
pour tous tes problčmes !
Qu'est-ce que c'est censé vouloir dire ?
Tu ne serais pas le premier
gars ā quitter sa femme, Éric !
Écoute, je ne te dis pas de
la quitter, je dis juste que...
Tu ne sais pas de
quoi tu parles, Jake.
Je parle de ce que
tu as peur de dire.
La vie est trop courte.
Bien, ne t'inquičte pas pour moi.
Conduis.
Merci de bien vouloir
parler avec nous, Robert.
Pas de problčme, Gray.
De quoi s'agit-il ?
Quand j'étais ā Topeka,
les gens disaient que tout ceci pourrait ętre la
premičre étape d'une invasion par un pays étranger,
sauf que faire entrer toutes ces bombes
dans le pays serait assez difficile...
Sans aide de l'intérieur ?
Exactement.
Je sais que vous et votre famille avez
déménagé juste avant les attaques.
Vous avez acheté votre maison en liquide...
avec un salaire de policier.
Vous voulez m'arręter pour ne
pas avoir pris un crédit sur trente ans ?
Non, bien sûr que non...
Bien, si cela ne vous dérange pas,
ma famille et moi allions nous mettre ā table...
En fait, si cela ne vous dérangeait pas de
nous tenir compagnie, deux minutes de plus.
Vous savez, depuis que tout ceci est arrivé, nous sommes
curieux au sujet des nouveaux venus ā Jericho.
Bien, pourquoi ne me posez-vous
pas simplement la question ?
Vous pensez vraiment que j'étais le génie derričre la
plus grande attaque terroriste de l'histoire du monde ?
L'ętes-vous ?
Écoutez, cela vous dérangerait-il si je posai
quelques questions ā votre famille ?
C'est marrant...
Quand j'étais policier, c'est exactement le genre de choses
que j'aurais dites... durant un interrogatoire.
Ā titre informatif.
Et j'aurais dit įa aussi, Gray !
Bien, Darcy voulait faire
la connaissance des voisins.
Venez !
Combien de temps
peut-il tenir comme įa ?
Je ne peux pas dire exactement...
Peut-ętre douze heures.
Douze heures ?
- Je suis vraiment désolée.
- Je...
Je suis marié ā cet
homme... depuis longtemps.
Je ne peux pas croire que
cela finisse de cette faįon.
J'ai apporté ā manger.
Ouais, rentre.
Gail est en haut.
J'avais cette phobie des produits laitiers
qui n'avaient pas besoin d'ętre réfrigérés.
Maintenant, je remercie Dieu pour
la nourriture au fromage fondu.
J'ai apporté de la soupe...
champignons crémeux.
J'ai tout pris, sauf les sandwiches.
Je pense que nous ne sommes pas seuls.
Comment va-t-il ?
Son état empire.
April ne pense pas qu'il
ait beaucoup de temps.
Oh, bonjour !
J'ai entendu la porte, je
pensais que c'était les garįons.
Heather a apporté ā manger.
Oh, merci, mon coeur.
Je suis vraiment désolée
pour votre mari, Mme Green.
De nos jours, ā notre époque, comment
quelqu'un peut-il mourir d'une fičvre ?
Nous sommes au 21čme sičcle, je ne
peux pas avoir les bons médicaments.
Je ne peux męme pas trouver
de la glace pour le refroidir !
Je peux fabriquer de la glace !
Je...
Un de nos étudiants avait un
projet en sciences l'an dernier.
J'ai juste besoin d'eau et...
Avez-vous de l'engrais ?
Peut-ętre, dans le garage.
OK.
Je peux le faire...
Je pense.
Bon, essayons !
D'accord.
Prenez tous les saladiers que vous avez.
Et prends plusieurs seaux, avec de l'eau du puits,
elle sera plus fraîche !
Je m'occupe de l'engrais.
Les seaux sont dans la buanderie.
Oų est passé tout le monde ?
Allez, on va ā l'hôpital.
Tu vois ces marques ?
Ces maisons ont été évacuées le 25 octobre par la FEMA.
[Federal Emergency Management Agency]
Le 25 octobre... Įa signifie qu'ils ont
survécu un mois aprčs les bombes.
Bon, si la FEMA était ici, au moins il y
a toujours une sorte de gouvernement.
Jusqu'ā la semaine derničre au moins.
Et les autres nombres ?
Le zéro, c'est le nombre
de vivants qu'ils ont trouvé.
Et le deux ?
Le nombre de morts.
On entre, on prend les médicaments,
et on ressort.
D'accord.
"L'Agence Fédérale de Gestion d'Urgences a déterminé"
"que les retombées radioactives de l'explosion ā Lawrence,
Kansas, ont contaminé la nappe phréatique de cette région."
"En aucun cas, l'eau provenant des puits et des cuves
ne devra ętre consommée. FEMA."
Bon, įa explique pourquoi
cet endroit est désert.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
D'oų įa vient ?
On doit aller ā l'intérieur !
T'éloigne pas.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ici ?
Tu vas bien ?
Ouais.
Les tirs venaient d'oų ?
D'en haut.
Qui nous a tirés dessus ?
J'en sais rien.
S'ils ont du Cipro, įa doit ętre ā l'étage supérieur.
Calibre 556.
Une arme automatique.
Peut-ętre qu'elles appartenaient ā ces mecs.
Je savais pas que Rogue River avait
une équipe d'intervention spéciale.
Ils n'en ont pas.
Ces gars sont pas des flics.
Ils sont employés par le gouvernement.
Une armée privée.
Une firme appelée Ravenwood.
Qu'est-ce que des mercenaires font au Kansas ?
La męme chose qu'ils ont faite
en Irak et ā la Nouvelle-Orléans.
Le nombre de militaires s'est tellement réduit ces
derničres années, ils deviennent incontournables.
La vraie question est :
est-ce qu'ils ont tué ces gens ?
Écoute, on prend les médicaments
et on s'en va, OK ?
D'accord.
T'es pręt ?
Bon boulot avec le fourneau.
Vous brûlez le bois dans le grill, c'est įa ?
Ouais.
On a de la chance que ce soit au gaz, et pas électrique,
il a son propre systčme d'aération.
Oų est ton frčre ?
Comment je peux le savoir ?
Je suis ici avec vous.
Allison...
Les bonnes maničres...
Prévenez-moi quand le dîner est pręt.
Vous voulez bien...
m'excuser un moment ?
Alors, Darcy, pourquoi avez-vous décidé
d'emménager ā Jericho ?
J'aime pas ce type.
J'ai besoin que tu fasses quelque chose pour moi, OK ?
Le nitrate d'ammonium contenu dans l'engrais
extrait la chaleur de l'eau.
Combien de temps įa prend ?
Un moment, je pense.
Je remonte et je vais le surveiller.
Bon sang, j'espčre ne pas faire de connerie.
Elle est éveillée depuis 24 heures.
Ils sont mariés depuis 40 ans.
Tu imagines ?
Je devais me marier demain.
Roger va revenir.
Tout comme Jake.
Reste prčs du mur.
Viens... Viens lā.
Écoute, s'il m'arrive quelque chose,
va ā la voiture et part.
D'accord ? Trouve une autre ville.
Cherche dans chaque maison, s'il le faut.
Jake, il ne va rien t'arriver.
OK ?
Comme toujours.
Foutons le camp !
Tu es allé ā l'école de Crow Island.
On a emménagé ici aprčs que notre
grand-pčre décčde.
Sam, est-ce que tu m'écoutes ?
J'ai faim. Je veux manger.
Oh, bon sang...
Tu sais quoi, Sam ?
Tu devrais le dire ā ces hommes en bas.
Continue de le dire autant que tu le peux, OK ?
Alors mon gars, qu'est-ce que tu dessines ?
Mon ancienne maison.
Ah ouais ?
Oų est-ce que c'est ?
J'ai faim.
Bon, tu sais quoi, dčs que l'on a fini de discuter,
ta maman te donnera un morceau de cette tarte.
Je la veux maintenant.
- Et bien, dans quelques...
- Maintenant, j'ai faim !
Il devient un peu aigri quand il a faim.
Ouais, je vois įa.
Įa vous dérange si on lui donne
quelque chose ā manger ?
Non, non, bien sûr que non.
Je l'emmčne ā la cuisine.
Viens Sam.
Įa te dérangerait de rester ici quelques minutes ?
Comme vous voulez.
Sam.
A plus tard, mon pote.
Įa va ?
Tu dis quelque chose ?
Tout ce que j'entends raisonne.
Įa va passer dans une minute.
Vous en bas, bougez plus !
Jetez vos armes !
Non.
Nous sommes ici pour des médicaments.
C'est urgent. On veut pas d'histoire.
Y'a pas de médicaments ici.
On veut regarder par nous-męmes.
On peut vous l'échanger contre de la nourriture.
On a tout ce dont on a besoin. Dégagez !
Jake...
- Quoi ?
- Quoi, t'es malade ?
Tu l'as entendu ?
Il est effrayé.
Il a jeté une grenade.
C'était une flash-bang, pas une grenade.
Įa brille et fait du bruit pour nous faire peur.
S'il avait voulu nous tuer, il l'aurait fait.
On pose nos armes et on monte.
Vous montez et je tire.
OK, on se calme...
N'avancez plus !
Gail...
C'est moi, April.
Gail est en bas.
Elle remontera bientôt.
J'aimerai pouvoir faire plus,
mais je ne peux pas.
S'il vous plait, tenez le coup encore un peu.
Je peux vous dire un secret ?
Vous allez ętre grand-pčre.
Je ne l'ai encore dit ā personne.
Męme pas ā Éric.
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il va dire.
Mais cet enfant a besoin d'un grand-pčre.
Tenez bon, OK ?
S'il vous plait.
Vous faites partie de Ravenwood.
Comment vous le savez ?
J'ai passé un an et demi ā organiser le ravitaillement
autour de l'aéroport de Bagdad.
Vous étiez en Irak ?
Soldat ?
Non,j'étais chauffeur pour un autre employeur,
mais j'ai rencontré beaucoup de gars de Ravenwood.
Oų étiez-vous ?
Fallujah.
Oh, et moi qui trouvais mon job risqué !
Je pensais que c'était la pire chose
que j'avais vécue...
Jusqu'ā aujourd'hui.
Įa vous dérange de baisser įa ?
Je suis lā uniquement pour les médicaments.
On n'a pas beaucoup de temps.
C'est mon frčre, Éric.
Moi, c'est Jake.
Allez.
Randy Payton.
Je vous emmčne voir le Docteur.
Vous ętes, euh...
Vous avez l'air plutôt mal en point.
Je tiens debout grâce ā la morphine et au café.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites au Kansas ?
Pas assez de gardes nationaux.
La sécurité territoriale est venue nous chercher.
On devait protéger le gouverneur du Nebraska.
Attendez, le gouverneur est en vie ?
J'en sais rien.
Quand on a atterri, ils nous ont envoyés ici
pour aider la FEMA ā évacuer Rogue River.
Vers oų ?
La FEMA a mis en place un camp dans
le parking d'un centre commercial.
Quelques kilomčtres au nord d'ici.
Qu'est-il arrivé ā tous ces gens ?
Ce sont ceux qu'on ne pouvait pas transporter.
Trop vieux...
Trop malade...
Alors, vous les avez tués ?
Non, pas moi.
On voulait les emmener,
mais le médecin a refusé.
Ils étaient si nombreux...
ā hurler, ā nous supplier.
Tous ces gens, ils voulaient juste rentrer,
prendre des médicaments et repartir.
Mais les médecins ont commencé a discuter avec eux,
et alors... un de nos hommes, il...
il a craqué.
Il a ouvert le feu.
Avant que je réalise, ils avaient déjā
tous vidé leurs chargeurs.
Pourquoi ne les avez-vous pas arrętés ?
Comment pensez-vous que
je me sois fait tirer dessus ?
Ils m'ont laissé pour mort avec les tous les autres.
Voilā le Docteur.
Quand je suis arrivé,
il m'a soigné...
du mieux qu'il a pu.
Depuis il essaye de sauver les autres.
Il me faut plus de lumičre.
Doc ?
Ouais ?
Voilā Jake et Éric.
Ils ont besoin de médicaments.
Dr. Kenchy Dhuwalia.
Excusez-moi de ne pas vous serrer la main.
J'ai besoin de Cipro.
D'accord.
La Morphine vaut plus le coup, vous savez ?
Ce n'est pas pour revendre, d'accord ?
J'en ai besoin tout de suite.
C'est pour mon pčre.
C'est Ravenwood.
Ils sont de retour.
Ils sont 6 ou 8.
Ils ont un camion.
Ils vont nettoyer l'hôpital.
Médicaments, ravitaillement,
tout ce qui est encore utilisable.
Ils tueront tous ceux qu'ils trouveront.
On sait de quoi ils sont capables.
Il faut les empęcher d'entrer.
Un de moins.
Il y a une sortie derričre ?
Elle est condamnée.
Vous voulez vivre ?
Debout, et battez-vous.
C'était aprčs la mort de ma Grand-Mčre,
elle a tout laissé ā mes parents.
Ils voulaient que je change d'école, alors...
on a déménagé.
Ton pčre était souvent absent
quand tu étais enfant ?
Bien sur.
C'est un flic.
Est-ce qu'il avait des amis,
ou n'importe qui que tu trouvais étrange ?
Tous ses amis sont des flics.
Et pour l'argent ?
Tes parents discutaient souvent d'argent ?
Comme tout le monde, non ?
Non, je.. Je pensais ā...
Tu sais, une soudaine rentrée d'argent.
- Comme l'héritage de ma Grand-Mčre ?
- Voilā.
C'était quand déjā ?
Quoi... mais vous ętes bouché ?
Je vous l'ai déjā dit, il y a 6 mois.
Ne lui manque pas de respect, Allison.
Papa, c'est des conneries... il est chez nous,
et il se comporte comme si on était des criminels.
Vous harcelez tout le monde dans
cette ville, ou juste les noirs ?
Įa suffit.
Pourquoi tu le laisses faire ?
Excusez-nous, M. Anderson.
Tu demandes des excuses ?
Oui, et toi aussi.
N'y pense męme pas.
- Je ne regrette rien.
- Excuse-toi.
Papa, ce n'est qu'un raciste !
Je hais cette ville stupide,
j'aurai préféré qu'on ne déménage pas !
Ils arrivent.
Pourquoi ils ne tirent pas ?
Il y a peu de munitions,
ils attendent un combat rapproché.
Prenez des chargeurs.
Ils sont tous vides.
Écoute, on prend les médicaments,
et on s'en va d'ici.
Doc !
Oų est le Cipro ?
Oų est le Cipro ?
Sur l'étagčre.
Ils viennent droit sur nous.
On doit se planquer, les laisser passer,
et foutre le camp.
Je n'ai męme pas pu en sauver un seul.
Pas un seul !
Doc, on doit y aller, sinon on va mourir aussi.
C'est bon... Je l'ai !
Venez !
Ma fille a traversé des périodes difficiles.
Mais je l'ai élevé mieux que įa.
Je vous assure, M. Hawkins,
que tout ceci n'a rien ā voir avec votre couleur.
Noir, blanc, ou autre, mon seul objectif
est de protéger les habitants de Jericho.
J'ai un garįon du męme âge.
Vous devriez l'amener parfois,
Samuel pourrait jouer avec lui.
Vous permettez que Jimmy jette un coup d'oeil
dans la maison pendant que l'on parle ?
Pardon ?
Histoire de ne rien laisser au hasard.
Est-ce que...
fouiller les maisons est une pratique courante ici ?
Je pensais qu'on était...
dans le Kansas, pas en Russie.
Vous savez, on a été assez conciliant jusque-lā.
Et je vous demande juste d'ętre encore un peu patient,
et je saurai que je peux me porter garant pour vous.
Ā moins que...
vous ayiez peur de ce que l'on pourrait découvrir.
Si vous vous accommodez du désordre...
on pourra accepter cette violation de nos droits.
Je jette juste un oeil, et...
aprčs nous partirons.
Allez, on y va.
On n'attend pas qu'ils quittent le bâtiment ?
Įa pourrait prendre des heures,
et Papa ne peut pas attendre.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Il est en état de choc septique.
Sepsis ?
Vous devez y retourner alors.
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Si votre Pčre est en choc septique,
le fonctionnement de ses organes va réduire.
Įa veut dire que le temps que vous reveniez,
son corps ne pourra plus traiter le Cipro.
Il vous faut un médicament intraveineux.
Du Levaquin.
Il y en a dans la salle d'opération.
A quoi įa ressemble ?
Une bouteille transparente,
avec une étiquette violette.
Il vous faut des seringues aussi.
Jake, c'est de la folie.
On ne peut pas y retourner.
On ne peut pas prendre le risque
d'avoir le mauvais médicament.
On y retourne en tirant dans le tas ?
Ouais, s'il faut.
Je suis avec vous.
Tu viens, ou pas ?
D'accord.
Mais il nous faut un plan.
T'as raison.
Įa prend trop de temps.
L'eau devrait commencer ā geler.
On va les vider et recommencer.
Il faut comprendre ce qui ne va pas.
Non. C'est tout ce qu'on a.
Le Maire n'en a plus pour longtemps.
Il faut le refroidir.
Tout le monde compte sur moi,
et įa ne marche pas.
Il faut attendre que įa agisse.
T'es en train de paniquer !
Celui-ci est froid.
Įa marche.
Il a quoi de différent celui-lā ?
Le...
Le bol, il est en aluminium.
Mon Dieu, le plastique neutralise la réaction...
je suis stupide.
Donc il nous en faut plus comme celui-lā ?
Ouais.
Tout ce qui est en métal,
des plats ā tarte... n'importe quoi.
- Je vais dans la cuisine.
- D'accord.
On a de la glace !
Ne tirez pas.
Je suis Docteur.
Je ne suis pas armé.
Ā genoux !
Qui ętes-vous ?
Je peux aider votre ami.
Vous vous appelez comment ?
Vous vous appelez comment ?
Ne m'obligez pas ā vous le redemander.
Éric.
Éric Green.
Je suis Docteur.
Je suis venu avec la Croix rouge.
Pour me tirer dessus ?
Ce n'était pas moi.
C'était qui ?
Les gars de la voiture, dehors ?
Je ne sais pas de qui vous parlez.
Qui sont-ils ?
Oų sont-ils ?
Dans la salle d'examen, en bas.
Ils sont... trois, ou quatre.
Allez les chercher.
Cet homme a perdu beaucoup de sang.
Je peux l'aider.
Debout.
Grenade !
Rien ā gauche.
Rien ā droite.
C'est vide.
On sort.
Trčs bien, il faut quelque chose
pour couper sa chemise.
Euh, quelque chose de stérile.
Hé, tu fais quoi ?
Je...
Je cherche quelque chose contre la douleur.
Il peut supporter la douleur.
Mets-toi au travail.
"Levaquin"
Vous avez enrôlé mon mari dans votre équipe,
et maintenant vous l'accusez d'ętre un criminel.
On ne l'accuse de rien.
- On veut juste savoir...
- Oui... Qui habite votre ville.
Oui, j'ai compris.
Įa n'a été agréable pour personne.
Pour certains encore moins que d'autres.
J'ai trouvé quelque chose.
"Federal Bureau of Investigation"
"Bureau du Directeur"
Darcy.
Laisse-moi seul un instant avec M. Anderson.
Payton, on y va.
- Allez-y !
- Venez !
La voiture est devant.
Venez !
Non. Je m'occupe d'eux.
Payton.
Ils vont vous tuer. Allez.
Je m'en fous.
Je le mérite.
J'ai participé au carnage aussi.
Allez-y.
Laissez-moi faire.
Allez !
Viens !
Oų est Payton ?
Il ne vient pas.
Pourquoi vous ne m'avez pas dit tout de suite
que vous étiez un agent fédéral ?
Comment pouvez-vous savoir
que ce badge n'est pas faux ?
Je pense...
je ne sais pas.
Les faux sont en général en aluminium.
Ils sont moins chers.
Plus légers.
Si c'est lourd...
c'est la preuve.
Ne pensez pas que si quelqu'un en a un alors c'est un vrai,
surtout pas en ce moment.
- Mais pourquoi ne m'avez-vous rien dit ?
- Parce que je ne vous connais pas.
Je ne sais pas ā qui je peux faire confiance.
Le Bureau surveillait des échanges suspects
entre des inconnus dans cette partie du Kansas et...
des groupes terroristes ā l'étranger.
Quel genre d'échanges ?
Des appels ā partir de cabines téléphoniques.
Des virements bancaires.
M. Anderson, on m'a envoyé ici
pour enquęter sous couverture.
Et en ce qui me concerne,
je suis toujours sur l'affaire, donc...
Votre discrétion serait fort appréciée.
Oui, bien sûr.
Jimmy est le seul ā ętre au courant.
Je vais m'assurer que įa n'ira pas plus loin.
Bien.
Les gens qui ont fait įa...
Ils vont essayer de nous attaquer ā nouveau.
On ne peut pas les laisser faire.
Mais ā partir de maintenant,
plus de secrets entre nous.
D'accord.
Įa a été une longue journée.
Si įa ne vous dérange pas...
Je suis heureux de vous avoir dans l'équipe,
M. Hawkins.
Je suis vraiment désolé pour cette intrusion.
Pas la peine de vous excuser de quoi que ce soit.
Vous avez fait du bon boulot.
Il vit encore ?
Ā peine.
Dépęchez-vous.
D'accord. Allons-y.
April...
Voici le Dr. Kenchy.
April Green.
Avez-vous pu avoir du Cipro ?
C'est du Levaquin.
Įa va entrer directement dans son organisme.
On est dans les temps ?
Et bien...
On saura demain matin si son corps le supporte.
Il le supportera.
Tu vas bientôt guérir, Papa.
Tu vas te rétablir, chéri.
Beau boulot.
Tu as la clé ?
Merci.
Je sais que tu es du côté des gentils.
Merci d'ętre restée avec ma mčre.
Įa m'a fait plaisir de t'aider.
Elle est trop modeste.
Elle a sauvé la vie de ton pčre.
Allez dormir maintenant.
Qu'avez-vous vu lā-bas ?
On en parlera ā un autre moment.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit.
C'est quoi tout įa ?
Je ne sais pas.
Comment tu te sens ?
Franchement...
J'en sais rien.
Tout ira bien.
D'accord ?
Tu t'en sortiras.
Tu es une bien meilleure personne que moi, donc...
Je sais que tout ira bien.
Je ne sais pas si je suis une meilleure personne.
Je suis amoureux de Mary Bailey.
Tu le savais, non ?
Je vais le dire ā April.
La vie est trop courte, hein ?
Quoi que tu fasses, je suis sûr
que tu prendras la bonne décision.
Allons nous reposer.
Oų est ma veste ?
Je ne sais pas. Tu ne l'as pas laissée
dans la voiture ?
Jake, j'ai laissé ma veste lā-bas.
Mon porte-monnaie est dedans... avec l'adresse.
Que se passera'-il si ces gars viennent ici ?
Ces gars sont morts, tu m'entends ?
Payton s'en est chargé.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Je suis désolé, j'ai merdé.
Tu as fait du bon boulot aujourd'hui.
Va dormir, on verra įa demain.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit.
Regarde įa.
Bougez-vous les mecs !
On déménage !
Jericho.

1 MOIS APRČS LES BOMBES
Jake...
J'ai vu.
Ralentis !
On ne s'arręte pas tant qu'on
n'a pas atteint Rogue River.
Tu peux pas la laisser au bord
de la route comme įa !
Tu vois les autres
traces de freinage derričre ?
On l'a forcé ā sortir de la route,
probablement pour la voler et la tuer.
Ils pourraient ętre en train d'attendre
pour recommencer.
Je n'aime pas įa plus que toi, mais
si nous n'y arrivons pas, papa mourra.
C'est le monde dans lequel
on vit maintenant.
Oui, c'est pręt...
Oh, non, chéri, attention,
mon coeur, c'est chaud !
Waouh, je n'arrive pas ā croire
que įa ait marché, m'man !
Oui, votre pčre est un
homme vraiment intelligent.
Je vais le chercher ?
Non, chérie, il travaille...
En plus, il faut que įa refroidisse.
<i>Bonjour !</i>
<i>Mme Hawkins, cela vous dérange-t-il
si nous entrons quelques minutes ?</i>
Gray Anderson et Jimmy veulent te voir.
Ils ont dit ā quel sujet ?
Non.
Mais je n'ai pas l'impression que ce soit
une simple visite de courtoisie.
D'accord.
Bon, j'ai trouvé la route pour aller ā
l'Hôpital du Comté de Rogue River.
- Prends "Cedar Run Road"...
- Non, pas įa.
Tu ne sais męme pas
ce que j'allais dire !
Oublie la carte, on prend
les routes secondaires.
Jake, papa n'attendra pas...
On doit prendre les médicaments et...
J'ai passé toute mon adolescence
sur ces routes.
On ne perdra pas de temps.
Tu penses toujours avoir raison.
Ces trucs sont chargés ?
Oui, ils sont chargés !
Qu'allons-nous devoir faire, Jake ?
Je ne sais pas, mais quand
viendra le moment de le faire...
Je serai pręt.

T'as rien dit depuis des
kilomčtres, reste vigilant.
Que t'est-il arrivé,  Jake ?
- Que veux-tu dire ?
- Ces cinq derničres années ?
Oų étais-tu ?
En prison, je suppose...
- Pourquoi tu ne veux rien dire ?
- Qu'est-ce que įa peut faire ?
Parce que durant tout ce temps,
j'étais lā ā regarder maman et papa souffrir.
Chaque fois que le téléphone
sonnait, ils pensaient que c'était toi !
Je détestais téléphoner chez eux,
parce qu'on a la męme voix au téléphone.
Je ne pouvais plus les écouter,
réalisant que ce n'était que moi !
Je suis désolé, d'accord ?
Je suis désolé...
pour ce que j'ai fait ā notre famille...
mais ne me prends pas comme excuse
pour tous tes problčmes !
Qu'est-ce que c'est censé vouloir dire ?
Tu ne serais pas le premier
gars ā quitter sa femme, Éric !
Écoute, je ne te dis pas de
la quitter, je dis juste que...
Tu ne sais pas de
quoi tu parles, Jake.
Je parle de ce que
tu as peur de dire.
La vie est trop courte.
Bien, ne t'inquičte pas pour moi.
Conduis.
Merci de bien vouloir
parler avec nous, Robert.
Pas de problčme, Gray.
De quoi s'agit-il ?
Quand j'étais ā Topeka,
les gens disaient que tout ceci pourrait ętre la
premičre étape d'une invasion par un pays étranger,
sauf que faire entrer toutes ces bombes
dans le pays serait assez difficile...
Sans aide de l'intérieur ?
Exactement.
Je sais que vous et votre famille avez
déménagé juste avant les attaques.
Vous avez acheté votre maison en liquide...
avec un salaire de policier.
Vous voulez m'arręter pour ne
pas avoir pris un crédit sur trente ans ?
Non, bien sûr que non...
Bien, si cela ne vous dérange pas,
ma famille et moi allions nous mettre ā table...
En fait, si cela ne vous dérangeait pas de
nous tenir compagnie, deux minutes de plus.
Vous savez, depuis que tout ceci est arrivé, nous sommes
curieux au sujet des nouveaux venus ā Jericho.
Bien, pourquoi ne me posez-vous
pas simplement la question ?
Vous pensez vraiment que j'étais le génie derričre la
plus grande attaque terroriste de l'histoire du monde ?
L'ętes-vous ?
Écoutez, cela vous dérangerait-il si je posai
quelques questions ā votre famille ?
C'est marrant...
Quand j'étais policier, c'est exactement le genre de choses
que j'aurais dites... durant un interrogatoire.
Ā titre informatif.
Et j'aurais dit įa aussi, Gray !
Bien, Darcy voulait faire
la connaissance des voisins.
Venez !
Combien de temps
peut-il tenir comme įa ?
Je ne peux pas dire exactement...
Peut-ętre douze heures.
Douze heures ?
- Je suis vraiment désolée.
- Je...
Je suis marié ā cet
homme... depuis longtemps.
Je ne peux pas croire que
cela finisse de cette faįon.
J'ai apporté ā manger.
Ouais, rentre.
Gail est en haut.
J'avais cette phobie des produits laitiers
qui n'avaient pas besoin d'ętre réfrigérés.
Maintenant, je remercie Dieu pour
la nourriture au fromage fondu.
J'ai apporté de la soupe...
champignons crémeux.
J'ai tout pris, sauf les sandwiches.
Je pense que nous ne sommes pas seuls.
Comment va-t-il ?
Son état empire.
April ne pense pas qu'il
ait beaucoup de temps.
Oh, bonjour !
J'ai entendu la porte, je
pensais que c'était les garįons.
Heather a apporté ā manger.
Oh, merci, mon coeur.
Je suis vraiment désolée
pour votre mari, Mme Green.
De nos jours, ā notre époque, comment
quelqu'un peut-il mourir d'une fičvre ?
Nous sommes au 21čme sičcle, je ne
peux pas avoir les bons médicaments.
Je ne peux męme pas trouver
de la glace pour le refroidir !
Je peux fabriquer de la glace !
Je...
Un de nos étudiants avait un
projet en sciences l'an dernier.
J'ai juste besoin d'eau et...
Avez-vous de l'engrais ?
Peut-ętre, dans le garage.
OK.
Je peux le faire...
Je pense.
Bon, essayons !
D'accord.
Prenez tous les saladiers que vous avez.
Et prends plusieurs seaux, avec de l'eau du puits,
elle sera plus fraîche !
Je m'occupe de l'engrais.
Les seaux sont dans la buanderie.
Oų est passé tout le monde ?
Allez, on va ā l'hôpital.
Tu vois ces marques ?
Ces maisons ont été évacuées le 25 octobre par la FEMA.
[Federal Emergency Management Agency]
Le 25 octobre... Įa signifie qu'ils ont
survécu un mois aprčs les bombes.
Bon, si la FEMA était ici, au moins il y
a toujours une sorte de gouvernement.
Jusqu'ā la semaine derničre au moins.
Et les autres nombres ?
Le zéro, c'est le nombre
de vivants qu'ils ont trouvé.
Et le deux ?
Le nombre de morts.
On entre, on prend les médicaments,
et on ressort.
D'accord.
"L'Agence Fédérale de Gestion d'Urgences a déterminé"
"que les retombées radioactives de l'explosion ā Lawrence,
Kansas, ont contaminé la nappe phréatique de cette région."
"En aucun cas, l'eau provenant des puits et des cuves
ne devra ętre consommée. FEMA."
Bon, įa explique pourquoi
cet endroit est désert.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
D'oų įa vient ?
On doit aller ā l'intérieur !
T'éloigne pas.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ici ?
Tu vas bien ?
Ouais.
Les tirs venaient d'oų ?
D'en haut.
Qui nous a tirés dessus ?
J'en sais rien.
S'ils ont du Cipro, įa doit ętre ā l'étage supérieur.
Calibre 556.
Une arme automatique.
Peut-ętre qu'elles appartenaient ā ces mecs.
Je savais pas que Rogue River avait
une équipe d'intervention spéciale.
Ils n'en ont pas.
Ces gars sont pas des flics.
Ils sont employés par le gouvernement.
Une armée privée.
Une firme appelée Ravenwood.
Qu'est-ce que des mercenaires font au Kansas ?
La męme chose qu'ils ont faite
en Irak et ā la Nouvelle-Orléans.
Le nombre de militaires s'est tellement réduit ces
derničres années, ils deviennent incontournables.
La vraie question est :
est-ce qu'ils ont tué ces gens ?
Écoute, on prend les médicaments
et on s'en va, OK ?
D'accord.
T'es pręt ?
Bon boulot avec le fourneau.
Vous brûlez le bois dans le grill, c'est įa ?
Ouais.
On a de la chance que ce soit au gaz, et pas électrique,
il a son propre systčme d'aération.
Oų est ton frčre ?
Comment je peux le savoir ?
Je suis ici avec vous.
Allison...
Les bonnes maničres...
Prévenez-moi quand le dîner est pręt.
Vous voulez bien...
m'excuser un moment ?
Alors, Darcy, pourquoi avez-vous décidé
d'emménager ā Jericho ?
J'aime pas ce type.
J'ai besoin que tu fasses quelque chose pour moi, OK ?
Le nitrate d'ammonium contenu dans l'engrais
extrait la chaleur de l'eau.
Combien de temps įa prend ?
Un moment, je pense.
Je remonte et je vais le surveiller.
Bon sang, j'espčre ne pas faire de connerie.
Elle est éveillée depuis 24 heures.
Ils sont mariés depuis 40 ans.
Tu imagines ?
Je devais me marier demain.
Roger va revenir.
Tout comme Jake.
Reste prčs du mur.
Viens... Viens lā.
Écoute, s'il m'arrive quelque chose,
va ā la voiture et part.
D'accord ? Trouve une autre ville.
Cherche dans chaque maison, s'il le faut.
Jake, il ne va rien t'arriver.
OK ?
Comme toujours.
Foutons le camp !
Tu es allé ā l'école de Crow Island.
On a emménagé ici aprčs que notre
grand-pčre décčde.
Sam, est-ce que tu m'écoutes ?
J'ai faim. Je veux manger.
Oh, bon sang...
Tu sais quoi, Sam ?
Tu devrais le dire ā ces hommes en bas.
Continue de le dire autant que tu le peux, OK ?
Alors mon gars, qu'est-ce que tu dessines ?
Mon ancienne maison.
Ah ouais ?
Oų est-ce que c'est ?
J'ai faim.
Bon, tu sais quoi, dčs que l'on a fini de discuter,
ta maman te donnera un morceau de cette tarte.
Je la veux maintenant.
- Et bien, dans quelques...
- Maintenant, j'ai faim !
Il devient un peu aigri quand il a faim.
Ouais, je vois įa.
Įa vous dérange si on lui donne
quelque chose ā manger ?
Non, non, bien sûr que non.
Je l'emmčne ā la cuisine.
Viens Sam.
Įa te dérangerait de rester ici quelques minutes ?
Comme vous voulez.
Sam.
A plus tard, mon pote.
Įa va ?
Tu dis quelque chose ?
Tout ce que j'entends raisonne.
Įa va passer dans une minute.
Vous en bas, bougez plus !
Jetez vos armes !
Non.
Nous sommes ici pour des médicaments.
C'est urgent. On veut pas d'histoire.
Y'a pas de médicaments ici.
On veut regarder par nous-męmes.
On peut vous l'échanger contre de la nourriture.
On a tout ce dont on a besoin. Dégagez !
Jake...
- Quoi ?
- Quoi, t'es malade ?
Tu l'as entendu ?
Il est effrayé.
Il a jeté une grenade.
C'était une flash-bang, pas une grenade.
Įa brille et fait du bruit pour nous faire peur.
S'il avait voulu nous tuer, il l'aurait fait.
On pose nos armes et on monte.
Vous montez et je tire.
OK, on se calme...
N'avancez plus !
Gail...
C'est moi, April.
Gail est en bas.
Elle remontera bientôt.
J'aimerai pouvoir faire plus,
mais je ne peux pas.
S'il vous plait, tenez le coup encore un peu.
Je peux vous dire un secret ?
Vous allez ętre grand-pčre.
Je ne l'ai encore dit ā personne.
Męme pas ā Éric.
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il va dire.
Mais cet enfant a besoin d'un grand-pčre.
Tenez bon, OK ?
S'il vous plait.
Vous faites partie de Ravenwood.
Comment vous le savez ?
J'ai passé un an et demi ā organiser le ravitaillement
autour de l'aéroport de Bagdad.
Vous étiez en Irak ?
Soldat ?
Non,j'étais chauffeur pour un autre employeur,
mais j'ai rencontré beaucoup de gars de Ravenwood.
Oų étiez-vous ?
Fallujah.
Oh, et moi qui trouvais mon job risqué !
Je pensais que c'était la pire chose
que j'avais vécue...
Jusqu'ā aujourd'hui.
Įa vous dérange de baisser įa ?
Je suis lā uniquement pour les médicaments.
On n'a pas beaucoup de temps.
C'est mon frčre, Éric.
Moi, c'est Jake.
Allez.
Randy Payton.
Je vous emmčne voir le Docteur.
Vous ętes, euh...
Vous avez l'air plutôt mal en point.
Je tiens debout grâce ā la morphine et au café.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites au Kansas ?
Pas assez de gardes nationaux.
La sécurité territoriale est venue nous chercher.
On devait protéger le gouverneur du Nebraska.
Attendez, le gouverneur est en vie ?
J'en sais rien.
Quand on a atterri, ils nous ont envoyés ici
pour aider la FEMA ā évacuer Rogue River.
Vers oų ?
La FEMA a mis en place un camp dans
le parking d'un centre commercial.
Quelques kilomčtres au nord d'ici.
Qu'est-il arrivé ā tous ces gens ?
Ce sont ceux qu'on ne pouvait pas transporter.
Trop vieux...
Trop malade...
Alors, vous les avez tués ?
Non, pas moi.
On voulait les emmener,
mais le médecin a refusé.
Ils étaient si nombreux...
ā hurler, ā nous supplier.
Tous ces gens, ils voulaient juste rentrer,
prendre des médicaments et repartir.
Mais les médecins ont commencé a discuter avec eux,
et alors... un de nos hommes, il...
il a craqué.
Il a ouvert le feu.
Avant que je réalise, ils avaient déjā
tous vidé leurs chargeurs.
Pourquoi ne les avez-vous pas arrętés ?
Comment pensez-vous que
je me sois fait tirer dessus ?
Ils m'ont laissé pour mort avec les tous les autres.
Voilā le Docteur.
Quand je suis arrivé,
il m'a soigné...
du mieux qu'il a pu.
Depuis il essaye de sauver les autres.
Il me faut plus de lumičre.
Doc ?
Ouais ?
Voilā Jake et Éric.
Ils ont besoin de médicaments.
Dr. Kenchy Dhuwalia.
Excusez-moi de ne pas vous serrer la main.
J'ai besoin de Cipro.
D'accord.
La Morphine vaut plus le coup, vous savez ?
Ce n'est pas pour revendre, d'accord ?
J'en ai besoin tout de suite.
C'est pour mon pčre.
C'est Ravenwood.
Ils sont de retour.
Ils sont 6 ou 8.
Ils ont un camion.
Ils vont nettoyer l'hôpital.
Médicaments, ravitaillement,
tout ce qui est encore utilisable.
Ils tueront tous ceux qu'ils trouveront.
On sait de quoi ils sont capables.
Il faut les empęcher d'entrer.
Un de moins.
Il y a une sortie derričre ?
Elle est condamnée.
Vous voulez vivre ?
Debout, et battez-vous.
C'était aprčs la mort de ma Grand-Mčre,
elle a tout laissé ā mes parents.
Ils voulaient que je change d'école, alors...
on a déménagé.
Ton pčre était souvent absent
quand tu étais enfant ?
Bien sur.
C'est un flic.
Est-ce qu'il avait des amis,
ou n'importe qui que tu trouvais étrange ?
Tous ses amis sont des flics.
Et pour l'argent ?
Tes parents discutaient souvent d'argent ?
Comme tout le monde, non ?
Non, je.. Je pensais ā...
Tu sais, une soudaine rentrée d'argent.
- Comme l'héritage de ma Grand-Mčre ?
- Voilā.
C'était quand déjā ?
Quoi... mais vous ętes bouché ?
Je vous l'ai déjā dit, il y a 6 mois.
Ne lui manque pas de respect, Allison.
Papa, c'est des conneries... il est chez nous,
et il se comporte comme si on était des criminels.
Vous harcelez tout le monde dans
cette ville, ou juste les noirs ?
Įa suffit.
Pourquoi tu le laisses faire ?
Excusez-nous, M. Anderson.
Tu demandes des excuses ?
Oui, et toi aussi.
N'y pense męme pas.
- Je ne regrette rien.
- Excuse-toi.
Papa, ce n'est qu'un raciste !
Je hais cette ville stupide,
j'aurai préféré qu'on ne déménage pas !
Ils arrivent.
Pourquoi ils ne tirent pas ?
Il y a peu de munitions,
ils attendent un combat rapproché.
Prenez des chargeurs.
Ils sont tous vides.
Écoute, on prend les médicaments,
et on s'en va d'ici.
Doc !
Oų est le Cipro ?
Oų est le Cipro ?
Sur l'étagčre.
Ils viennent droit sur nous.
On doit se planquer, les laisser passer,
et foutre le camp.
Je n'ai męme pas pu en sauver un seul.
Pas un seul !
Doc, on doit y aller, sinon on va mourir aussi.
C'est bon... Je l'ai !
Venez !
Ma fille a traversé des périodes difficiles.
Mais je l'ai élevé mieux que įa.
Je vous assure, M. Hawkins,
que tout ceci n'a rien ā voir avec votre couleur.
Noir, blanc, ou autre, mon seul objectif
est de protéger les habitants de Jericho.
J'ai un garįon du męme âge.
Vous devriez l'amener parfois,
Samuel pourrait jouer avec lui.
Vous permettez que Jimmy jette un coup d'oeil
dans la maison pendant que l'on parle ?
Pardon ?
Histoire de ne rien laisser au hasard.
Est-ce que...
fouiller les maisons est une pratique courante ici ?
Je pensais qu'on était...
dans le Kansas, pas en Russie.
Vous savez, on a été assez conciliant jusque-lā.
Et je vous demande juste d'ętre encore un peu patient,
et je saurai que je peux me porter garant pour vous.
Ā moins que...
vous ayiez peur de ce que l'on pourrait découvrir.
Si vous vous accommodez du désordre...
on pourra accepter cette violation de nos droits.
Je jette juste un oeil, et...
aprčs nous partirons.
Allez, on y va.
On n'attend pas qu'ils quittent le bâtiment ?
Įa pourrait prendre des heures,
et Papa ne peut pas attendre.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Il est en état de choc septique.
Sepsis ?
Vous devez y retourner alors.
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Si votre Pčre est en choc septique,
le fonctionnement de ses organes va réduire.
Įa veut dire que le temps que vous reveniez,
son corps ne pourra plus traiter le Cipro.
Il vous faut un médicament intraveineux.
Du Levaquin.
Il y en a dans la salle d'opération.
A quoi įa ressemble ?
Une bouteille transparente,
avec une étiquette violette.
Il vous faut des seringues aussi.
Jake, c'est de la folie.
On ne peut pas y retourner.
On ne peut pas prendre le risque
d'avoir le mauvais médicament.
On y retourne en tirant dans le tas ?
Ouais, s'il faut.
Je suis avec vous.
Tu viens, ou pas ?
D'accord.
Mais il nous faut un plan.
T'as raison.
Įa prend trop de temps.
L'eau devrait commencer ā geler.
On va les vider et recommencer.
Il faut comprendre ce qui ne va pas.
Non. C'est tout ce qu'on a.
Le Maire n'en a plus pour longtemps.
Il faut le refroidir.
Tout le monde compte sur moi,
et įa ne marche pas.
Il faut attendre que įa agisse.
T'es en train de paniquer !
Celui-ci est froid.
Įa marche.
Il a quoi de différent celui-lā ?
Le...
Le bol, il est en aluminium.
Mon Dieu, le plastique neutralise la réaction...
je suis stupide.
Donc il nous en faut plus comme celui-lā ?
Ouais.
Tout ce qui est en métal,
des plats ā tarte... n'importe quoi.
- Je vais dans la cuisine.
- D'accord.
On a de la glace !
Ne tirez pas.
Je suis Docteur.
Je ne suis pas armé.
Ā genoux !
Qui ętes-vous ?
Je peux aider votre ami.
Vous vous appelez comment ?
Vous vous appelez comment ?
Ne m'obligez pas ā vous le redemander.
Éric.
Éric Green.
Je suis Docteur.
Je suis venu avec la Croix rouge.
Pour me tirer dessus ?
Ce n'était pas moi.
C'était qui ?
Les gars de la voiture, dehors ?
Je ne sais pas de qui vous parlez.
Qui sont-ils ?
Oų sont-ils ?
Dans la salle d'examen, en bas.
Ils sont... trois, ou quatre.
Allez les chercher.
Cet homme a perdu beaucoup de sang.
Je peux l'aider.
Debout.
Grenade !
Rien ā gauche.
Rien ā droite.
C'est vide.
On sort.
Trčs bien, il faut quelque chose
pour couper sa chemise.
Euh, quelque chose de stérile.
Hé, tu fais quoi ?
Je...
Je cherche quelque chose contre la douleur.
Il peut supporter la douleur.
Mets-toi au travail.
"Levaquin"
Vous avez enrôlé mon mari dans votre équipe,
et maintenant vous l'accusez d'ętre un criminel.
On ne l'accuse de rien.
- On veut juste savoir...
- Oui... Qui habite votre ville.
Oui, j'ai compris.
Įa n'a été agréable pour personne.
Pour certains encore moins que d'autres.
J'ai trouvé quelque chose.
"Federal Bureau of Investigation"
"Bureau du Directeur"
Darcy.
Laisse-moi seul un instant avec M. Anderson.
Payton, on y va.
- Allez-y !
- Venez !
La voiture est devant.
Venez !
Non. Je m'occupe d'eux.
Payton.
Ils vont vous tuer. Allez.
Je m'en fous.
Je le mérite.
J'ai participé au carnage aussi.
Allez-y.
Laissez-moi faire.
Allez !
Viens !
Oų est Payton ?
Il ne vient pas.
Pourquoi vous ne m'avez pas dit tout de suite
que vous étiez un agent fédéral ?
Comment pouvez-vous savoir
que ce badge n'est pas faux ?
Je pense...
je ne sais pas.
Les faux sont en général en aluminium.
Ils sont moins chers.
Plus légers.
Si c'est lourd...
c'est la preuve.
Ne pensez pas que si quelqu'un en a un alors c'est un vrai,
surtout pas en ce moment.
- Mais pourquoi ne m'avez-vous rien dit ?
- Parce que je ne vous connais pas.
Je ne sais pas ā qui je peux faire confiance.
Le Bureau surveillait des échanges suspects
entre des inconnus dans cette partie du Kansas et...
des groupes terroristes ā l'étranger.
Quel genre d'échanges ?
Des appels ā partir de cabines téléphoniques.
Des virements bancaires.
M. Anderson, on m'a envoyé ici
pour enquęter sous couverture.
Et en ce qui me concerne,
je suis toujours sur l'affaire, donc...
Votre discrétion serait fort appréciée.
Oui, bien sûr.
Jimmy est le seul ā ętre au courant.
Je vais m'assurer que įa n'ira pas plus loin.
Bien.
Les gens qui ont fait įa...
Ils vont essayer de nous attaquer ā nouveau.
On ne peut pas les laisser faire.
Mais ā partir de maintenant,
plus de secrets entre nous.
D'accord.
Įa a été une longue journée.
Si įa ne vous dérange pas...
Je suis heureux de vous avoir dans l'équipe,
M. Hawkins.
Je suis vraiment désolé pour cette intrusion.
Pas la peine de vous excuser de quoi que ce soit.
Vous avez fait du bon boulot.
Il vit encore ?
Ā peine.
Dépęchez-vous.
D'accord. Allons-y.
April...
Voici le Dr. Kenchy.
April Green.
Avez-vous pu avoir du Cipro ?
C'est du Levaquin.
Įa va entrer directement dans son organisme.
On est dans les temps ?
Et bien...
On saura demain matin si son corps le supporte.
Il le supportera.
Tu vas bientôt guérir, Papa.
Tu vas te rétablir, chéri.
Beau boulot.
Tu as la clé ?
Merci.
Je sais que tu es du côté des gentils.
Merci d'ętre restée avec ma mčre.
Įa m'a fait plaisir de t'aider.
Elle est trop modeste.
Elle a sauvé la vie de ton pčre.
Allez dormir maintenant.
Qu'avez-vous vu lā-bas ?
On en parlera ā un autre moment.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit.
C'est quoi tout įa ?
Je ne sais pas.
Comment tu te sens ?
Franchement...
J'en sais rien.
Tout ira bien.
D'accord ?
Tu t'en sortiras.
Tu es une bien meilleure personne que moi, donc...
Je sais que tout ira bien.
Je ne sais pas si je suis une meilleure personne.
Je suis amoureux de Mary Bailey.
Tu le savais, non ?
Je vais le dire ā April.
La vie est trop courte, hein ?
Quoi que tu fasses, je suis sûr
que tu prendras la bonne décision.
Allons nous reposer.
Oų est ma veste ?
Je ne sais pas. Tu ne l'as pas laissée
dans la voiture ?
Jake, j'ai laissé ma veste lā-bas.
Mon porte-monnaie est dedans... avec l'adresse.
Que se passera'-il si ces gars viennent ici ?
Ces gars sont morts, tu m'entends ?
Payton s'en est chargé.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Je suis désolé, j'ai merdé.
Tu as fait du bon boulot aujourd'hui.
Va dormir, on verra įa demain.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit.
Regarde įa.
Bougez-vous les mecs !
On déménage !
Jericho.

--Jake...
--I see it.
--Slow down.
Not stopping until we get to Rogue River.
--You can't just leave her on the side of
the road like that.
--See that second set of skid marks back there?
Means someone forced her off the road
and probably robbed her and killed her.
For all we know, they could be waiting out there
to do it again.
I don't like it anymore than you do
but if we don't make it, Dad dies.
This is the world we live in now.
Oh.
Yes, it's ready.
Oh, no, honey, watch out, sweetie.
It's hot.
Wow, I can't believe it worked, Mom.
Yes, your father is a very smart man.
--Should I go get him?
--No, honey. He's working.
Besides, this thing needs time to cool.
Hello.
Mrs. Hawkins, do you mind if we come
in for a few minutes?
Hey, Gray Anderson and Jimmy are here to see you.
--They say about what?
--No.
I mean, I didn't get the feeling it
was just a friendly house call.
Okay.
Okay.
I got a route to the County Hospital in Rogue River.
--Take Cedar Run Road...
--No good.
You don't even know what I was going to say.
--Put the map away, we're taking the back roads.
--Jake, Dad's on borrowed time.
--We need to get the medicine and get back here!
-- I spent most of my teenage years driving these roads.
We'll make up the time.
You always think you know better.
These things loaded?
Yes, it's loaded.
What are we going to have to do, Jake?
I don't know, but when it comes time to do it...
I'll be ready.
You haven't said anything for miles.
Stay sharp.
What happened to you, Jake?
--What do you mean?
--The last five years?
Where were you?
I'm assuming jail.
--Why won't you tell me?
--Why does it matter?
Because, all that time
I stood and I watched Mom and Dad suffer.
Every time the phone rang,
they thought it was you.
I used to hate calling the house
because we sound the same on the phone.
I couldn't listen to them
realizing it was only me.
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry
for what I did to our family
but don't use me as an excuse
for not getting on with your life.
What's that supposed to mean?
You wouldn't be the first guy
to leave his wife, Eric.
Look, I'm not telling you to leave her
--I'm just saying that...
-- You don't know what you're talking about, Jake.
I'm talking about what you're afraid to say.
Life's too short.
Well, don't worry about me.
Just drive.
--Thanks for talking with us, Robert.
--No problem, Gray.
What's this all about?
When I was in Topeka,
people were saying that all of this could
be a first step in a foreign invasion,
except that getting all these bombs
into the country would be pretty difficult...
Without help on the inside.
Exactly.
I understand you and your family
moved to Jericho just before the attacks.
You bought your house in cash on a cop's salary.
--Am I under arrest for not taking on
a 30-year mortgage?
--No, of course not.
Well, if you wouldn't mind
--my family and I were just about
to sit down to dinner.
--Actually, if you wouldn't mind humoring us,
for a couple more minutes.
You know, since all of this happened
we're all, I think, understandably curious
about anybody who's new in Jericho.
Well, why don't you just ask me the question?
You really think I was the mastermind behind the largest
terrorist attack in the history of the world?
Were you?
Sorry... Listen, would you mind
if I just ask your family a few questions?
That's funny.
You know, when I was a cop,
that is just the kind of thing
that I would say during an interrogation.
--Purely informational.
--And I would have said that, too, Gray.
Well, Darcy's been wanting
to get to know the neighbors.
Come on.
How long can he hold on like this?
I can't say for sure.
Maybe 12 hours.
--12 hours?
--I am so sorry.
I... I've been married to that man for a long time.
I refuse to believe this is the way it ends.
--Oh,  hey.
--Hey.
--I brought some food.
--Yeah. Come in.
Gail's upstairs.
I used to have this phobia of dairy products
that didn't need to be refrigerated.
Now I think God for processed cheese food.
I brought soup-- creamy mushroom
--The only stuff I have left is what I had
for the food drive.
--I guess we're not the only ones.
How is he?
He's getting worse.
April doesn't think he has a lot of time.
Oh, hi.
I heard the door.
I thought it was the boys.
Heather brought some food.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
I'm so sorry about your husband, Mrs. Green.
In this day and age,
how can someone die of a fever?
It's the 21st century,
I can't get the right drugs.
Can't even find ice to cool him off.
I can make ice.
I... one of the students had a project
in the science fair last year.
I just need water and...
Do you have fertilizer?
Maybe. In the garage.
Okay. I can do this... I think.
Okay, let's try.
Okay. Grab every large bowl you have.
And can you get some buckets, and get
some fresh water from the well.
It'll be cooler.
I'll get the fertilizer.
Buckets are in the laundry room.
Where is everybody?
Come on.
Let's get to the hospital.
See those markings?
These homes were evacuated 10-25 by FEMA.
10-25-- that means they came through a
month after the bombs.
Well, if FEMA was here, at least there's still
some sort of government.
As  of a week ago.
What  are the other numbers?
The zero is the number they found alive.
And the two?
The number of dead.
We're going to go in, we're going to get the medicine,
and we're going to get out.
Okay.
"Federal Emergency Management Agency
has determined that
radioactive fallout from the blast in Lawrence,
Kansas has contaminated the water table of this region.
"Under no circumstances should water
from any taps or wells be consumed. FEMA."
Well, I guess that explains why
this place is empty.
What the hell?!
Where's that coming from?!
We got to get inside!
Stay close.
Oh, my God.
What happened here?
You okay?
Yeah.
--Where do you think those shots came from?
--Top floor.
Who the hell would be shooting at us?
I don't know; if they have any Cipro,
it's probably upstairs.
.556.
From an automatic weapon.
Maybe they belong to these guys.
--I didn't know Rogue River had a SWAT team.
--They don't.
These guys aren't cops.
They're government contractors.
A private army. A firm called Ravenwood.
What are mercenaries doing in Kansas?
The same thing they've been
doing in Iraq and New Orleans.
The military's been stretched so thin
the past few years, mercenaries became a commodity.
The real question is,
did they kill these people?
--Look, let's just get the drugs and go, okay?
--All right.
--You ready?
--Yeah.
Nice job with the stove.
You burn the wood in the broiler-- right.
Yeah. You know, we're just lucky
we had gas instead of an electric
'cause it's got its own built-in vent.
Where's your brother?
How should I know?
I'm here with you.
Allison... manners.
Let me know when dinner's back on.
Will you, um... just pardon me a moment?
So, Darcy, why did you decide to move to Jericho?
Hey.
I don't like that guy.
I need you to do something for me, okay?
The ammonium nitrate in fertilizer
extracts the heat from the water.
--How long is this supposed to take?
--I think a while.
I'm going to go up and check on him.
God, I hope I'm not screwing this up.
She's been up for 24 hours.
They've been married for 40 years.
Can you imagine?
I'm was supposed to be married tomorrow.
Hey, hey.
Roger's coming back.
So'Jake.
All right, stay close to the wall.
Come on. Come here.
Look, if something happens to me, get
in the car and go.
All right? Find another town.
Search house to house, if you have to.
Jake, nothing is going to happen to you.
Okay? Nothing ever does.
Go! Go! Move!
You went to Crow Island School.
We moved here after our grandfather died.
--Sam, are you listening?
--I'm hungry. I want dinner.
Oh, God...
You know what, Sam?
You should tell that to the guys in there.
Just keep saying it as much
as you can, okay.
--Hey, pal, what you drawing?
--My old house.
Oh, yeah?
Well, where is that?
I'm hungry.
Well, you know what, as soon
as we're finished talking
--maybe your mom will give you some of that pie.
--I want it now.
--Well, in a few...
--Now. I'm hungry.
--He gets a little cranky when he's hungry.
--Yeah, I see that.
--You mind if we get him something to eat?
--No, no, of course not.
I'll take him to the kitchen.
Come on, Sam.
Would you mind hanging out for a couple minutes?
Whatever.
Sam.
See ya, buddy.
You okay?
You say something?
All I hear is ringing.
It'll pass in a minute.
--You down there, freeze! Drop your weapons!
--No.
We're here for medicine.
It's an emergency.
We don't want trouble.
There's no medicine here.
We want to look for ourselves.
We can trade you for food.
We have everything we need.
Go away.
--Jake...
--What?
What, are you crazy?
Didn't you hear him? He's scared.
He threw a grenade. That was a flash-bang,
not a grenade.
It's just loud and bright to scare us.
If he'd wanted to kill us, he would have.
Putting our weapons down and coming up.
You come up and I'll shoot you.
All right, just take it easy.
That's far enough.
Gail...
Oh, it's me, April.
Gail's downstairs.
She'll be up soon.
I wish there was something more I could do.
But there isn't.
Please just hold on a little longer.
Can I tell you a secret?
You are going to be a grandfather.
I haven't told anyone yet.
Not even Eric.
I don't know what he's going to say.
But this child needs a grandpa.
Hold on, okay?
Please.
You're with Ravenwood.
How do you know?
I spent a year and a half in the Green Zone
running a supply rig up and down
Route Irish to BIAP.
You were in Iraq?
--Soldier?
--No, I just drove a truck for another contractor
but I met a lot of Ravenwood guys.
Where were you?
Fallujah.
Man, I thought I had it bad.
I thought it was the worst thing
I'd ever lived through...
till  now.
You mind putting that thing down?
I'm just here for medicine.
We don't have a lot of time.
This is my brother Eric. I'm Jake.
Come on.
Randy Payton.
I'll take you to see the doc.
You're in, uh...
you're in pretty bad shape.
Morphine and instant coffee are the only things
keeping me standing right now.
What are you doing in Kansas?
Not enough National Guard.
Homeland Security hired us.
Brought us in to protect
the governor of Nebraska.
Wait, the governor's alive?
Don't know.
When we landed,
they brought us over here to help FEMA
evacuate Rogue River.
Where to?
FEMA  set up a tent city in a Wal-Mart parking lot.
A few miles north of here.
What happened to these people?
These are the ones that couldn't be moved.
Too old...
too sick.
So you just killed them?
No, not me.
We tried to move them.
But the doctors wouldn't allow it.
There were so many of them.
Crying out, begging.
The guys, they just wanted to come in
and they just wanted to take the medicine
and they wanted to leave
but the doctors started arguing with them
and then, one of our guys, he...
he just snapped.
He started firing.
Before I knew it, they all emptied their weapons.
Why didn't you stop them?
How do you think I got shot?
They left me for dead with everybody else.
There's the doc.
When I came to, he was working on me.
Patched me up as best he could.
Been trying to save everybody else since then.
I need more bloody light.
--Doc?
--Yeah?
This is Jake and Eric.
And they need medicine.
Dr. Kenchy Dhuwalia.
Forgive me if I don't shake your hand.
I need Cipro.
Right.
Morphine's worth a lot more, you know?
Hey, I'm not selling it, all right?
I need it now.
It's for my father.
It's Ravenwood.
They're back.
There are six or eight of them.
They brought a truck.
They're gonna clean out the hospital.
Medicine, supplies, anything that's not nailed down.
And they're gonna kill anybody they find alive.
We know what they did.
We can't let them get inside.
Hey! Hey!
One down.
--What about a back exit?
--It's barricaded.
You want to live, stand up and fight.
Well, that's when my grandma died
and left everything to my parents.
They wanted me out of the school
I was in, so... we moved.
--Was your father away from home
a lot when you were a kid?
--Of course. He's a cop.
Mm. Did he bring friends around, anybody
you thought was kind of strange?
His friends are all cops.
What about money?
--Did your parents ever argue over money?
--Doesn't everyone's?
No, I-I'm thinking...
you know, about the sudden windfall.
--Like my Grandma's inheritance?
--Right.
When was that again?
What-what, are you stupid?
I already told you, six months ago.
Don't be disrespectful, Allison.
Dad, this is bull-- he's in our house
acting like we're criminals or something.
--Are you harassing everyone in
town or just the black people?
-- That's enough
--Why are you letting him do this?
--Look, I apologize, Mr. Anderson.
--You're  apologizing to him?
--Yes, and so will you.
--Oh-ho, forget that. I'm not sorry.
--Apologize.
Dad, he's a racist!
I hate this stupid town--
I wish we never moved!
They're coming in.
Why weren't they shooting?
Ammo's in short supply-- they're
gonna wait to fight in close.
--Take some of these clips.
--They're all empty.
Look, we got to get the medication
and get out of here. Doc!
Where's the Cipro?
--Where's the Cipro!
--On the shelf.
They're gonna come straight for us.
We got to hide, let 'em pass,
then we can slip out.
I couldn't even save one.
Not even one!
Doc, we got to go or we're gonna be dead, too.
--I got it, I got it!
--Come on!
My girl's been through a lot.
--But I raised her better than that.
--I want to assure you, Mr. Hawkins,
that this is not about color.
Black, white or otherwise, my only objective
is to protect the people of Jericho.
I got a boy about the same age.
You should bring yours over sometime-- Samuel
could use a playmate.
Would you mind if Jimmy has a quick look
around the house while we talk?
Excuse me?
Just a question of being thorough.
And is... searching houses standard policy here?
I thought this was... Kansas, not Soviet Russia.
You know, we been pretty easy-going about all this.
And I'm only asking for a little more
patience so I know I can vouch for you.
Unless... you're afraid
there's something we'll find.
You know, if you can overlook the mess...
...we can overlook the violation of our civil rights.
Um...
I'll just take a quick peek around, and...
then we'll be on our way.
Come on, let's go.
What do you say we wait
till they leave the building?
That could take hours--
Dad doesn't have hours.
What's wrong with him?
He's gone into septic shock.
Sepsis? You have to go back.
What are you talking about?
If your father's in septic shock,
that means his organs are shutting down.
That means that by the time
you get to him
his body won't even be able
to process the Cipro.
You need an intravenous drug.
It's called Levaquin.
--It's back in the ICU.
--What's it look like?
It's a clear bottle, purple label.
--You'll need syringes.
--Jake, this is nuts. We can't go back there.
Well, we can't take the chance we have
the wrong medicine.
--What, we gonna shoot our way through?
--Yeah, if I have to.
I'm with you.
Are you with me or not?
Okay.
--But we need a plan.
--All right.
This is definitely taking too long.
Like the water should be freezing by now.
You know, let's just dump these and start over.
--Okay, shouldn't we wait till we figure out
what we've done wrong?
No. This is all we have.
The mayor's running out of time.
We got to cool him down.
Everybody's counting on me,
and it's not working.
Yeah, but we have to give it time to work.
Okay, you're freaking out!
This one's cold.
It's working.
What did you do differently with this one?
The... the bowl-- it's aluminum.
--God, plastic's an insulator-- I'm so stupid.
--So we just need more of these, right?
--Yeah.
--Anything metal-- pie tins, anything.
--All right, I'll get 'em from the kitchen.
--Okay.
We got ice!
Don't shoot.
I'm a doctor. I'm unarmed.
On your knees.
Who are you?
I can help your friend.
What's your name?
What's your name?
--Don't make me ask you again.
--Eric.
Eric Green. I'm a doctor.
The Red Cross brought me here.
To shoot at me?
--That wasn't me.
--Who was it?
The guys in that muscle car?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are they?
Where are they?
They're in the therapy room downstairs.
There's, uh, three or four of them.
Get 'em.
Your man lost a lot of blood.
I can help him.
Get up.
Fire in the hole!
Clear left.
Clear right.
Room's empty. Move out.
All right, we need something to cut his shirt.
Uh, s-something sterile.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm... I'm just getting something for the pain.
He can handle the pain.
Just get to work.
You people drafted my husband
into your police force
and now you're suspecting him
of being a criminal.
We're not suspecting anything.
--We just want to know...
--Yeah.
"Who's in your town."
Yeah, I heard.
This has been unpleasant for all of us.
Some more than others.
I found something.
Darcy.
I'm gonna need a minute alone with Mr. Anderson.
Payton, let's go! Go on! Come on!
Car's out front. Go!
No. This is on me.
--Payton. They'll kill you. Come on.
--I don 't care.
I deserve this.
I emptied my gun up there, too.
Go. Let me do this.
Come on! Go!
--Where's Payton?
--He's not coming.
Why didn't you just tell me
you were a federal agent?
How do you even know that that badge is real?
I guess...
I don't.
The fakes are usually made of aluminum.
It's cheaper. Lighter.
If it's heavy...
...that's how you know.
Don't just assume that because somebody has
one of these that it is real
especially not these days.
--But why didn't you say anything?
--Because I don't know you.
I don't know who I can trust.
You see, the bureau was tracking some
suspicious contacts
between unknown people
in this area of Kansas and...
terrorist groups abroad.
What kind of contacts?
Pay phone calls.
Money transfers.
You know, I was relocated to investigate
undercover, Mr. Anderson.
and as far as I'm concerned
I am still on the job, so...
--I would appreciate your discretion.
--No, of course. Jimmy's the only one who knows.
--I'll make sure it stays that way.
--Good.
The people who did this, they will try
to hit us again.
We can't let that happen.
But from now on, we keep an open line
with one another.
Okay, then.
Man, it's been a long day.
If you don't mind...
I'm just happy to have you on the team, Mr. Hawkins.
I'm very sorry for the intrusion.
You do not have to apologize for anything.
You did good work.
Is he?
Barely. Just hurry.
--Okay, let's go.
--April...
--This is Dr. Kenchy.
--April Green.
Did you get the Cipro?
This is Levaquin.
It will go directly into his system.
--Are we on time?
--Well...
if his body is strong enough,
we will know by morning.
He's strong enough.
You're gonna be all right, Dad.
You're going to be okay, sweetheart.
It's a nice job.
Got the key?
Thank you.
I know you're one of the good guys.
--Thanks for staying with my mom.
--Glad to help.
She's being humble.
She saved your father's life.
Well, you guys get some sleep.
What did you see out there?
Another time.
Good night.
Good night.
--What's all this stuff?
--I don't know.
How you feeling?
Honestly...
Couldn't tell you.
You'll be okay.
All right?
You'll get through this.
You're a much better person than I am, so...
I know you'll be fine.
I don't know if I'm a better person.
I'm in love with Mary Bailey.
You knew that, didn't you?
I'm gonna tell April.
Life's too short, right?
Whatever you do, I'm sure
it'll be the right thing.
Let's get some rest.
Where's my jacket?
I don't know. Did you leave it in the car?
Jake, I left my jacket back there--
the wallet is in the jacket-- the address.
--What if those guys come here?
--Those guys are dead, all right?
Payton took care of it.
Don't worry.
--I'm sorry I screwed up.
--You did great out there today.
Get some sleep, we'll worry about it tomorrow.
--Good night.
--Good night.
Good. See to that.
Mount up, boys! We're moving out!
Jericho.
Il est 8h00 du matin,
par une belle journée d'automne.
Levez-vous, sortez du lit...
Tu as entendu ?
Debout ma Chérie.
Je pensais qu'on allait faire
la grasse matinée.
- C'est fait, je me suis levé à 6h00.
- Oh, Roger.
Ce mariage n'est peut-être pas une
si bonne idée.
Tu as encore quelques heures
pour changer d'avis.
Si tu reviens dans le lit,
je ne changerai pas d'avis.
Oh, Emily, j'aimerais bien.
Je dois aller voir nos invités.
Apparemment ils ne sont pas satisfaits
de leur hébergement.
Ils sont dans le meilleur
Bed & Breakfast de la ville.
Ouais, mais ça les change de leur
appartement avec vue sur Central Park.
Tes parents se feront à l'idée qu'une fille
de la campagne leur pique leur garçon ?
Bien sur.
Dès que nous retournerons
vers la civilisation.
Le bruit, les embouteillages,
et la pollution.
Tu oublies la criminalité.
Je ne plaisante pas, Roger.
C'est là que nous vivrons quand
nous serons mariés.
Tu es sûre que c'est ce que tu veux ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Tu es sûre que c'est ce que tu veux ?
Roger !
<i>On fait le plein des Hummers.</i>
<i>Quelqu'un à la fenêtre...
Il y a quelqu'un ici.</i>
Hé !
Mais qu'est-ce que vous
foutez ici les gars ?
Hé, je vous parle.
Désolé, on ne voulait pas vous
déranger à cette heure.
- Stanley, que se passe-t-il ?
- Retourne à l'intérieur et ferme la porte.
C'est une propriété privée,
pas une station à essence.
On vous remboursera, Monsieur.
On travaille pour le Gouvernement.
Ah ouais, et quel genre de travail ?
On s'assure que les gens ne manquent
de rien... médicaments, nourriture, eau.
Un ami m'a demandé de passer
le voir si nous étions dans le coin..
Vous connaissez Eric Green ?
Désolé, je ne peux pas vous aider.
Merci pour le plein.
Salut.
Tu es resté là toute la nuit ?
Je voulais garder un oeil ouvert,
juste au cas où...
Ecoute, Jake, hier quand on a parlé
de ce que tu avais fait...
Comment ça va avec April ?
Tu lui as dit pour toi et Mary ?
Je pense pas que ce soit le bon moment.
Ouais, ça ne le sera jamais.
Eric...
Salut, rentrez.
Salut.
Désolé de venir si tôt.
On était réveillés.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Des gars se sont pointés
à la ferme hier soir.
Deux Hummers, avec des armes.
- Ils connaissaient le nom d'Eric.
- Ravenwood.
Qui ?
Des mercenaires.
On les a croisés à Rogue River.
Bon, et qu'est-ce qu'il veulent ?
Tout.

- Ravenwood ? C'est quoi ça ?
- C'est une société de protection privée.
Ils recrutent des paumés, des anciens militaires,
et les envoient jouer aux petits soldats.
Pourquoi ils sont au Kansas ?
La FEMA les a engagés pour évacuer Rogue River.
Mais maintenant... ils sont à leur compte.
Ils ont pillé la ville entière,
tué les policiers... et les civils.
- Déjà entendu parler d'eux ?
- Ils vont s'en prendre à Jericho.
C'était des éclaireurs, je pense,
pour voir si ça vaut le coup.
On devrait fortifier la ville, au cas où,
bloquer les points les plus vulnérables.
J'ai déjà mis en place des points de contrôle
sur Cherry Valley Road et la Route 660.
- Des points de contrôle ?
- Ouais, pour tous ceux qui entrent en ville.
Le Maire est malade, tu étais parti,
ça ne pouvait pas attendre.
Ils viendront probablement de l'Est,
par Tacoma Bridge.
On devrait le bloquer.
Ma ferme est de l'autre côté du pont,
ainsi que 30 autres familles.
Ils doivent tous se réfugier en ville,
ils ne sont plus en sécurité là-bas.
Tu veux que j'abandonne ma ferme ?
Jake, c'est une plaisanterie.
Juste pour le moment, Stanley.
Bill, charge-toi de récupérer des armes,
tout ce qui est disponible.
- On stockera ça ici.
- J'ai des explosifs à la mine.
On prend tout ce que tu as.
Bonjour, April.
Je pensais apporter quelque chose
à manger pour Johnston.
Non, il vaut mieux le laisser dormir.
Laisse son corps réagir aux médicaments.
D'accord.
- Prête à entendre de bonnes nouvelles ?
- Tu plaisantes ?
Sa tension artérielle se stabilise.
Et la fièvre semble se dissiper.
Il va s'en sortir.
Et bien, ça mérite une célébration.
Veux-tu de la purée de pois ?
Non, merci.
La journée ne commence pas si bien,
si tu vois de quoi je parle.
Bien sûr, c'est peut-être les nerfs,
autant que la grossesse.
Les nerfs ?
Tu n'en as pas parlé à Eric ?
Il était si épuisé hier soir.
Et ce matin il s'est levé avant
que j'aie le temps.
- Tu sais où il a pu aller ?
- Non.
Lui et Jake étaient déjà partis
quand je suis descendue ce matin.
Gail...
tu ne penses pas qu'il...
enfin, les circonstances sont...
Tu parles de mon premier enfant.
Les circonstances sont idéales.
Dis-lui maintenant.
Ramenez du monde.
Il y a une ferme plus loin,
avec des camions en panne.
- Rapportez-les ici, ça fera une barricade.
- D'accord.
- Vous pensez que ça suffira ?
- C'est mieux que rien.
Ce n'est pas la première fois que vous
affrontez Ravenwood, hein ?
Pourquoi ?
Vous êtes parti à Rogue River,
et subitement ils se dirigent vers Jericho.
- Je vous pensais plus prudent.
- Vous pensez que je les ai attirés ici ?
- J'essaye juste de comprendre, Jake.
- Alors je vais être clair...
- Ma famille vit à Jericho.
- La mienne aussi.
- Je cherche uniquement à les protéger.
- Pareil.
Alors arrêtons de tourner en rond,
on a du boulot.
Qu'est-ce que je fais ?
- Em, tu es là ? C'est Heather.
- Ouais, un instant.
- Désolée de te déranger.
- C'est bon.
C'est pour toi.
C'est ce qui ressemblait le plus
à un bouquet de mariage.
Merci.
Je suis désolée, ça te gêne ?
Tu devais te marier aujourd'hui.
Il fallait que je fasse quelque chose.
Tu vois, pour marquer l'occasion.
En tant que demoiselle d'honneur.
Oublie-moi simplement, Ok ?
C'est très gentil de ta part.
Tu as prévu quelque chose aujourd'hui ?
A part ne pas me marier ?
Je pensais que je pourrais m'occuper
de toi toute la journée.
On pourrait aller se promener.
- Simplement marcher le long de la rivière.
- Je ne serais pas de bonne compagnie.
Il faut que tu aies de la compagnie.
- Evite de te morfondre.
- Je n'ai pas vraiment le choix, hein ?
Pas vraiment.
C'est bon.
On a besoin d'une autre voiture.
Mettez-la ici.
C'est pas la première fois que vous
avez à faire à eux non plus, hein  ?
- Il y a une chose que je voudrais
savoir, Jake.  - Quoi ?
Etes-vous conscient quand la
situation vous dépasse ?
- Tu es de retour.
- Juste un instant.
J'emporte ça à la Mairie.
Eric, attends. J'ai...
J'ai quelque chose à te dire.
D'accord.
Parlons.
Quand j'ai...
fait rédiger les papiers
pour le divorce,
je ne voyais aucun futur pour notre relation.
Mais maintenant, c'est différent.
Pas pour moi.
Quoi ?
Ecoute, la dernière chose que je souhaite
faire, c'est te faire du mal, April,
mais j'aime quelqu'un d'autre.
Qui ?
Mary Bailey.
April...
Ecoute, April...
- April, je suis désolé...
- Non, tu ne peux pas faire ça.
T'es qu'un enfoiré !
<i>Aux camions ! Vite !
Ils arrivent !</i>
Ils sont là.
Hé, ils sont là !
Revenez !
Courrez !
Allez, dépêchez-vous.
Ils arrivent, ils arrivent.
Allez, allez.
Foutez le camp.
En position, vérifiez vos munitions,
enlevez les sécurités.
Grouillez-vous !
- Souvenez-vous ce qu'on a dit !
- Personne ne tire avant que je le dise.
Et souvenez-vous...
La chose la plus importante à faire avant
de presser la détente est de respirer, OK ?
L'un de vous veut me parler ?
Quiconque soit votre chef,
cette route doit être dégagée.
Nous sommes envoyés par le
gouvernement pour collecter des provisions.
Respire.
Cessez le feu !
Cessez le feu !
Ecoutez-moi.
Nous sommes envoyés par le
gouvernement pour collecter des provisions.
Votre coopération est obligatoire.
Compris ?
Obligatoire.
Quand je reviendrai ici, il vaudrait
mieux que le pont soit dégagé.
Ou je m'en occuperai moi-même.
Vous avez quatre heures.
Compris ?
On y va.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va pouvoir faire ?
Il n'y a aucun moyen de tenir le pont.
Il va falloir qu'on le détruise.
Je suis d'accord.
Qu'est-ce que vous racontez ?
Il ne faut plus qu'il y ait de pont.
J'ai eu du mal avec M. Adams.
- Il t'a donné ses munitions sans rien dire ?
- Oh, il en a gardées plein.
Le studio de Guy ressemble
à la base d'Alamo.
- Où est-ce que je pose ça ?
- Dans la réserve d'armes.
- Eric...
- Pourquoi tu n'es pas au pont ?
Il faut qu'on parle.
- Impossible, on fera pas ça.
- Réfléchis ! Si on détruit le pont, on sera pas envahis.
Jusqu'à ce que Ravenwood arrive par un autre chemin.
Pas avant qu'ils passent New Bern
ou une autre ville.
- Mieux vaut eux que nous.
- Ca nous fera gagner du temps.
On pourra utiliser tous nos hommes
pour sécuriser les autres routes.
J'arrive pas à y croire.
Si on détruit ce pont,
on le reconstruira pas.
Vous pensez qu'on s'en sortira sans ?
Et les fermes de l'autre côté ?
C'est le seul accès en hiver.
Il y a des fermes plus près de la ville.
OK, et ces maisons que vous allez isoler ?
- Jake, on isole Stanley.
- Ils viendront de ce côté.
- Ecoutez, il doit y avoir un autre moyen.
- Ravenwood va revenir.
On n'a pas le temps.
Tu proposes quoi ?
Il nous faut plus d'hommes,
mettez-les aux avants postes s'il faut.
Envoyer plus d'hommes, c'est subir plus de pertes.
Bill...
Enferme les explosifs.
- Attends une minute...
- Rien n'arrivera à ce pont.
On peut les contrer avec tout
ce qu'on rassemblera.
- Comment peux-tu... ?
- La réponse est non.
Je vais chez Gracie prendre de l'huile,
du cirage, du dentifrice, ce qu'il restera.
Oh, et si le moteur se met à tousser,
accélère un peu pour ne pas caler.
Et garde un oeil sur la température.
Si l'aiguille va dans le rouge,
coupe le moteur,
parce qu'il te reste environ deux secondes
avant que ça n'explose, OK ?
- Pour... pourquoi je peux pas y aller ?
- Oh, non, non, non.
Je ne veux pas que tu aies d'ennui.
D'accord.
Hé, la Lune, ici la Terre,
tu attends quoi ?
Allez, on y va.
Alors, ça y est.
Tu es prête ?
Pourquoi ? J'en ai pas l'air ?
Si, tu es parfaite pour l'occasion.
Alors, allons-y !
Qu'est-ce que t'attends, Em?
Emily...
Emily...
Emily...
Emily!
Em... Em, Em, coupe le moteur.
- Coupe le moteur.
- Je suis désolée.
- Il y avait ce camion avec des gars armés.
- Ouais.
Euh, on ne va pas faire de randonnée aujourd'hui.
Tout le monde est supposé rester à l'abri.
Quelque chose se passe à l'extérieur de la ville.
- Toutes les routes sont bloquées.
- Rentrons chez nous.
"Chez nous" ?
Ils n'ont pas dit "chez nous".
Ils ont dit "à l'abri".
Heather, je, euh...
Hé, écoute, c'est pas
la fin du monde, d'accord ?
Parce que c'est déjà arrivé.
Qu'est-ce qu'on doit faire ?
On va passer directement à
la deuxième étape.
- J'ai trouvé deux fusées de détresse.
- Bien.
Mettez deux hommes en position
à deux kilomètres du pont,
donnez leur les fusées,
et dites leur d'envoyer le signal
quand Ravenwood sera en vue.
Gray, je vais rassembler autant
d'essence et d'engrais que possible.
Je vous retrouve au pont.
Il fabrique des explosifs ?
- Alors vous le détruisez quand même ?
- C'est exact.
Ecoute, Jake, tu es loyal envers ton frère
et ta famille, je comprends.
Si tu veux te retirer,
personne ne t'en voudra.
Mais ce pont va s'écrouler.
Où tu vas ?
Quelqu'un doit dire aux gens qui
vivent là-bas de revenir en ville.
- Alors c'est ça l'étape deux ?
- Ouais.
Salut, vous avez entendu pour
le pont de Tacoma ?
Ouais, pourquoi penses-tu qu'on a annulé
la partie sportive de la journée ? Les clés ?
Euh, je ne connais pas le plan,
mais je sais pas si c'est
une bonne idée.
C'est quoi le plan exactement ?
C'est peut-être la dernière bouteille de Scotch
que l'on verra avant un bon bout de temps.
Si tu le dis, on l'ouvre !
Mais si on l'ouvre, on ne part pas
tant qu'elle n'est pas finie.
Donc l'étape deux, c'est qu'on
finisse complètement saoules ?
Plus ou moins.
Ca marche pour moi.
Il est là depuis ce matin.
Je le plains.
Il semblerait qu'il ait eu
deux semaines éprouvantes.
Mesdames.
Alors qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
J'en dis "Et puis merde !".
Je retrouve la fille que je connais.
Qui prendra les fusées de détresse ?
Stanton Broksmier.
Vous faites sauter le pont ?
Les Miller seront là dans une heure.
Leur vieille Nova fonctionne.
Vous pourrez monter avec eux.
- Va faire ton sac.
- Non.
Ne discute pas avec moi.
Quand cette voiture arrivera, tu monteras dedans.
Maintenant, vas-y !
Et toi ?
Je reste.
Ne sois pas stupide, Stanley.
Ils reviennent.
Jake, je les retiendrai.
Je l'ai déjà fait.
Il n'y aura pas seulement quelques
hommes cette fois.
Ils n'ont laissé que des cadavres
à Rogue River.
Tu veux finir comme ça ?
Stanley, s'il te plait, ne te fais pas
tuer pour une maison.
Hey, mon grand-père a construit cette
maison à partir de rien.
Et la chambre où tu as dormi...
C'était celle de mon père quand il était petit.
Ils ont mis ça dans ton fichier d'audit ?
Je ne vais pas abandonner sans me battre.
Si on avait des gardes,
des personnes entraînées,
on pourrait leur faire face,
mais c'est pas le cas.
Une fois le pont explosé, quiconque sera de
ce coté sera livré à lui-même.
OK, alors va prévenir les gens.
Tu perds ton temps ici.
Ils sont là.
Prends tes affaires.
Je ne pars pas.
C'est aussi ma maison.
- Bonnie, tu n'es pas en sécurité ici.
- Je n'ai pas peur.
- Bonnie... Ne discute pas avec moi.
- Tout ira bien si on reste ensemble.
Stanley.
- Elle ne part pas ?
- Je ne peux pas la forcer.
Tu risques sa vie... et la tienne.
- Je ne comprends pas, Stanley.
- Parce que c'est pas ta famille.
Bonnie a grandi dans cette maison,
nous l'avons fait tous les deux.
Cette maison est son seul lien avec une mère
et un père dont elle se souvient à peine.
C'est étrange, je pensais que
c'était toi ce lien.
Bonne chance.
Santé.
C'est votre commandant qui vous parle.
- Nous sommes dans une zone de turbulence.
- Tu vas bien ?
Je vais super bien.
Hé... toi là.
Mr. Sombre et Intriguant.
Garde un oeil sur ma copine jusqu'à
mon retour et je te paye un verre.
Votre amie est en pleine forme, hein ?
Je peux ?
- Alors, c'est votre anniversaire ?
- Non.
Je...
Non.
Au secret alors.
C'est pas terrible là-dehors, hein ?
Oh, pauvreté, meurtre, maladie.
C'est vraiment misérable.
Désolé. Désolé.
- J'ai bu, et j'ai pas dormi depuis des semaines.
- Pareil pour moi.
- T'as tout pris, c'est bon ?
- On vient de charger la dernière boîte.
Bill, qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ici ?
Je suis désolé, Eric.
Je m'en charge, Bill.
- Où est la putain de dynamite ?
- La décision est prise.
- On fait sauter le pont.  - Qui ça "on" ?
- Moi, Hawkins, les adjoints... et ton frère.
- Hé !
- Je dois parler à Papa.
- Non, tu vas me parler tout de suite.
- J'ai pas le temps.
April m'a raconté.
Maman, je ne voulais pas que
les choses prennent cette tournure.
Vraiment, et tu voulais que
ça se passe comment ?
Tu as choisi de ne pas t'occuper de ton mariage.
- Tu as choisi de tromper ta femme.
- J'essaie de faire ce qu'il y a de mieux.
- Je sais que l'on ne dirait pas...
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Johnston...
- Papa...
Les mercenaires de Rogue River,
ils nous ont suivis.
On a un point de contrôle au pont de Tacoma
et je pense qu'on peut le défendre.
mais il y a un plan visant à le détruire
et isoler la ville.
Gray Anderson ?
Ouais, il est dehors en train de l'équiper.
- Où sont Jimmy et Bill?
- Dehors en train d'aider Gray.
- Papa, je suis tout seul.
- Va chercher ton frère et arrêtez-les.
Jake est avec eux, aussi.
Alors tu les arrêtes.
Qu'importe la manière, tu les arrêtes.
Coûte que coûte.
- Comment ça se passe ?
- Plus que quelques fils.
Dépêchez-vous les gars.
OK tout le monde, continuez d'avancer !
Il faut maintenir l'allure.
On doit continuer à avancer.
- Si on voit le signal, ça sera trop tard.
- John, j'ai besoin du camion. S'il te plait.
On n'a plus beaucoup de temps, messieurs.
OK, c'est bon.
Attache les à ça.
Assure toi que les lignes ne se croisent pas.
- Eloigne bien le doré du bleu.
- Jake.
Je l'ai. Ouais, ouais.
Eric...
Tiens, c'est la ligne principale.
- Papa veut que ça s'arrête.
- Papa n'a pas toutes les informations.
- C'est quand même ce qu'il demande, Jake.
- Il est pas là pour le faire.
Eric...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Je vais arrêter tout ça.
On pourrait voir le signal
à n'importe quel moment.
Tu seras isolé.
Tu ne peux pas aller là-bas, OK ?
Eric !
Oh merde !
C'est le signal !
- Ils arrivent !  - On a deux minutes.
- Ravenwood arrive.
On doit toujours relier la ligne principale.
Eric est de l'autre côté.
On n'a pas le temps, Jake.
Fais sortir tout le monde du pont.
- Partez aussi loin que vous pouvez.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Partez ! Maintenant ! Partez !
Par ici les gars !
Par ici !
Tout le monde dégage du pont !
Partez aussi loin que possible !
On va le faire sauter !
Allez !
Pas mal. Pas mal cette fois.
Donc je viens de...
de commencer mon entraînement.
- Je suis dans ce pays depuis 6 mois.
- Où ?
Las Vegas.
Ne rigolez pas, ne rigolez pas !
C'est une ville merveilleuse.
C'est vraiment un endroit merveilleux.
Ce n'est pas si merveilleux
sans eau et sans électricité.
Je me suis pratiquement jeté dans les
bras de la Croix-Rouge pour en sortir.
Un geste noble, mais dont le but
était de sauver mes fesses !
Vous avez fait ce que vous aviez à faire.
Alors, ils m'ont envoyé dans
le Kansas... et me voilà.
Je devrais être assis au bord d'une piscine,
entouré de belles femmes.
Des rousses, de préférence,
et des blondes, des blondes aussi.
Ouais, fumer un cigare,
vivre le rêve Américain.
- J'étais censée me marier aujourd'hui.
- Vraiment ?
J'aurais dû être là...
juste à cet endroit.
Les pieds sur la table, à boire un verre.
- Emily !
- Ouais ?
- Tu veux que je mette quoi après ?
- La même.
"Polyester Bride" en boucle ?
Je vous trouve ironique le jour
de votre mariage, Emily Sullivan !
Si j'étais ironique,
je te demanderais Alanis..
Et ce sera Emily Hammond,
dans environ... 30 minutes.
Hé, viens-là.
On a besoin d'un coup de main, d'accord ?
Heather, je ne peux pas partir
avec tout ce monde dans le bar.
Tu laisses ton téléphone allumé,
que je suive le mariage ?
Pas de problème.
- Stanley, tu vas t'habiller quand ?
- A la fin du match.
Le mariage est dans une demi-heure.
Oh non ! Prolongation !
Pourquoi ?
Avant qu'on se dirige vers l'église,
je voudrais porter un toast à la mariée
qui rougit et au garçon de la banque.
L'homme de la banque.
Bon, de toute façon c'est un banquier.
Qui aurait pensé que Roger et
Emily iraient ensemble ?
C'est un investissement à haut risque !
Il n'y a aucun risque avec lui.
Tout à fait.
A Emily et Roger.
Qu'ils vivent heureux ensemble
pour l'éternité.
Sans remises en question,
sans s'épier mutuellement,
et sans se demander s'ils étaient faits
pour une autre vie.
Santé, tout le monde.
A l'avenir.
Repose en paix.
Mais que fait-il ?
Il va les arrêter.
Le pont est miné.
Vous êtes garés au-dessus
d'un kilo de dynamite.
Faites demi-tour,
ou je fais tout sauter.
Sur ordre du Gouvernement, nous
collectons des vivres et des médicaments
pour le camp de réfugiés de Rogue River.
Le même Gouvernement qui vous a ordonné
de tuer tous ces gens à l'hôpital ?
Ces dernières semaines ont été
difficiles, c'est le chaos.
Ecartez-vous, nous prendrons ce que
nous voulons et nous partirons.
Allez-y, donnez l'ordre.
Si je meurs, vous mourrez.
Il y a quelque chose de drôle ?
Ouais... tout ça.
Vous n'appuierez pas sur ce bouton.
Voilà comment ça va se passer.
Vous et vos amis paysans baissez vos armes,
on remonte dans nos véhicules,
on va en ville chercher ce dont on a
besoin, et on ne reviendra jamais.
Personne n'a besoin de mourir.
Un homme à terre !
Un homme à terre !
Vous allez avoir besoin de beaucoup
plus de snipers, mon pote.
Des voitures arrivent !
En position, maintenant !
- C'est Jonah Prowse?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il peut bien foutre ici ?
Que représente cette ville pour vous ?
Vous savez... bientôt les choses vont
redevenir comme avant.
Le gouvernement va se rétablir.
Et ils essaieront de tous vous aider.
Et vous savez qui ils enverront ?
Moi.
Allons-y !
La prochaine fois que tu veux couper
la route qui me permet de venir en ville,
j'apprécierais que tu me tiennes au courant.
De rien.
Vraiment. Pas la peine de me remercier.
Puis-je vous faire une suggestion ?
Vous devriez trouver un moyen
de vous défendre par vous-même.
Si Eric n'était pas venu me chercher,
vous auriez tous pu enterrer Jake demain.
Alors c'est comme ça que ça va être ?
Des journées à boire, des nuits solitaires, et
la vision dérangeante d'une fiancée morte ?
Es-tu...?
Quoi ?
Mort ?
Ca te faciliterait les choses ?
Non.
Je n'en sais rien.
Je ne me souviens même plus du son
de ta voix, ça fait tellement longtemps.
J'aurais dû prendre cet avion avec toi.
Tu n'aurais jamais quitté cet endroit.
Tu ne t'es jamais demandée pourquoi ?
Un frère, une mère décédée.
Un père qui n'en était pas vraiment un.
Et c'est ça qui te retient à Jéricho ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je pense que si.
Em ?
Ca va ?
- Que se passera-t-il s'ils reviennent ?
Nous avons posté des sentinelles armées.
Et s'il faut en arriver là, le pont
est toujours miné.
Je pense toujours que nous
devrions le faire sauter maintenant.
Et bien, ce n'est pas toi qui décides, Gray.
- Ravi de vous revoir sur pieds, Johnston.
- Monsieur le Maire.
Et maintenant j'aimerais bien que
quelqu'un me dise qui est le chef ici.
Si nous sommes touchés de l'autre côté, ce pont
pourrait être le seul moyen de nous en tirer.
Il y a des gens pour nous aider
de l'autre côté de ce pont.
Notre peuple - le monde entier -
est de l'autre côté de ce pont.
Si nous détruisons ce pont,
nous sommes perdus d'avance.
Tout le monde ici va dans ce sens.
Y compris votre fils.
Non.
Pas tout le monde.
Si vous trouvez une vraie solution pour
sauver cette ville, faites-le moi savoir.
- Papa, je pense que tu devrais...
- Toi, pas un mot.
Je suis le seul ici à avoir été élu.
Je ne ferai pas cela.
C'est aussi simple que ça.
Il est peut-être temps de décider si c'est
toujours à vous de prendre les décisions.
Stanley ?
Non, je ne veux pas qu'elle vienne.
Tu n'es qu'un idiot.
Oui. Elle a dit que c'était bon pour elle.
Très bien.
J'attends dehors.
Je t'ai plutôt mis en mauvaise
posture, là-dehors, hein ?
Gray s'est servi de toi, fiston.
J'espère que tu l'as compris.
Papa, tu n'as pas vu
de quoi ces gars sont capables.
- Je ne suis pas ici pour me battre.
- Pourquoi es-tu là, alors ?
On a besoin d'une force de sécurité.
Une vraie force armée, bien entraînée.
Que tu auras autorisée.
Cela appartenait à ton grand-père.
Il l'avait sur lui quand il a été
parachuté le jour J.
Quand il a dû prendre la tête de son peloton,
ce livre et l'entraînement qu'il a reçu lui ont permis
d'aller en Allemagne après Omaha Beach.
Je me souviens de cette histoire.
Assure-toi de prendre
les bonnes décisions.
Je ne rentrerai pas ce soir.
Je passerai demain pour prendre mes vêtements.
- Ecoute, maman, April... - Pourra rester
chez nous aussi longtemps qu'elle le voudra.
Merci, Jimmy.
On a fait du beau boulot, aujourd'hui.
Non.
Non, on a juste eu de la chance.
Emily ?
Tout va bien ?
Oui.
J'ai vu Heather.
Elle est complètement à l'ouest.
Je crois que j'ai bien abusé moi aussi.
Je sais quel jour nous
sommes aujourd'hui.
Ma mère a toujours l'invitation
sur son frigo.
Tu sais, on n'a jamais parlé de lui.
Roger.
Que veux-tu savoir ?
Comment a-t-il fait sa demande ?
Verres en cristal et caviar.
Je peux aller me coucher avec
ma demande au whisky sur un parking.
Nous n'étions que des gosses.
Comment aurions-nous pu savoir ?
On en savait assez pour
ne pas aller au bout.
Pourquoi es-tu revenu, Jake ?
Pourquoi ne pouvais-tu pas
rester loin de moi ?
Es-tu sûre que c'est ce que tu voulais ?
Pardon ?
Es-tu sûre que c'est ce que tu voulais ?
www.seriessub.com
Il est 8h00 du matin,
par une belle journée d'automne.
Levez-vous, sortez du lit...
Tu as entendu ?
Debout ma Chérie.
Je pensais qu'on allait faire
la grasse matinée.
- C'est fait, je me suis levé à 6h00.
- Oh, Roger.
Ce mariage n'est peut-être pas une
si bonne idée.
Tu as encore quelques heures
pour changer d'avis.
Si tu reviens dans le lit,
je ne changerai pas d'avis.
Oh, Emily, j'aimerais bien.
Je dois aller voir nos invités.
Apparemment ils ne sont pas satisfaits
de leur hébergement.
Ils sont dans le meilleur
Bed & Breakfast de la ville.
Ouais, mais ça les change de leur
appartement avec vue sur Central Park.
Tes parents se feront à l'idée qu'une fille
de la campagne leur pique leur garçon ?
Bien sur.
Dès que nous retournerons
vers la civilisation.
Le bruit, les embouteillages,
et la pollution.
Tu oublies la criminalité.
Je ne plaisante pas, Roger.
C'est là que nous vivrons quand
nous serons mariés.
Tu es sûre que c'est ce que tu veux ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Tu es sûre que c'est ce que tu veux ?
Roger !
<i>On fait le plein des Hummers.</i>
<i>Quelqu'un à la fenêtre...
Il y a quelqu'un ici.</i>
Hé !
Mais qu'est-ce que vous
foutez ici les gars ?
Hé, je vous parle.
Désolé, on ne voulait pas vous
déranger à cette heure.
- Stanley, que se passe-t-il ?
- Retourne à l'intérieur et ferme la porte.
C'est une propriété privée,
pas une station à essence.
On vous remboursera, Monsieur.
On travaille pour le Gouvernement.
Ah ouais, et quel genre de travail ?
On s'assure que les gens ne manquent
de rien... médicaments, nourriture, eau.
Un ami m'a demandé de passer
le voir si nous étions dans le coin..
Vous connaissez Eric Green ?
Désolé, je ne peux pas vous aider.
Merci pour le plein.
Salut.
Tu es resté là toute la nuit ?
Je voulais garder un oeil ouvert,
juste au cas où...
Ecoute, Jake, hier quand on a parlé
de ce que tu avais fait...
Comment ça va avec April ?
Tu lui as dit pour toi et Mary ?
Je pense pas que ce soit le bon moment.
Ouais, ça ne le sera jamais.
Eric...
Salut, rentrez.
Salut.
Désolé de venir si tôt.
On était réveillés.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Des gars se sont pointés
à la ferme hier soir.
Deux Hummers, avec des armes.
- Ils connaissaient le nom d'Eric.
- Ravenwood.
Qui ?
Des mercenaires.
On les a croisés à Rogue River.
Bon, et qu'est-ce qu'il veulent ?
Tout.

- Ravenwood ? C'est quoi ça ?
- C'est une société de protection privée.
Ils recrutent des paumés, des anciens militaires,
et les envoient jouer aux petits soldats.
Pourquoi ils sont au Kansas ?
La FEMA les a engagés pour évacuer Rogue River.
Mais maintenant... ils sont à leur compte.
Ils ont pillé la ville entière,
tué les policiers... et les civils.
- Déjà entendu parler d'eux ?
- Ils vont s'en prendre à Jericho.
C'était des éclaireurs, je pense,
pour voir si ça vaut le coup.
On devrait fortifier la ville, au cas où,
bloquer les points les plus vulnérables.
J'ai déjà mis en place des points de contrôle
sur Cherry Valley Road et la Route 660.
- Des points de contrôle ?
- Ouais, pour tous ceux qui entrent en ville.
Le Maire est malade, tu étais parti,
ça ne pouvait pas attendre.
Ils viendront probablement de l'Est,
par Tacoma Bridge.
On devrait le bloquer.
Ma ferme est de l'autre côté du pont,
ainsi que 30 autres familles.
Ils doivent tous se réfugier en ville,
ils ne sont plus en sécurité là-bas.
Tu veux que j'abandonne ma ferme ?
Jake, c'est une plaisanterie.
Juste pour le moment, Stanley.
Bill, charge-toi de récupérer des armes,
tout ce qui est disponible.
- On stockera ça ici.
- J'ai des explosifs à la mine.
On prend tout ce que tu as.
Bonjour, April.
Je pensais apporter quelque chose
à manger pour Johnston.
Non, il vaut mieux le laisser dormir.
Laisse son corps réagir aux médicaments.
D'accord.
- Prête à entendre de bonnes nouvelles ?
- Tu plaisantes ?
Sa tension artérielle se stabilise.
Et la fièvre semble se dissiper.
Il va s'en sortir.
Et bien, ça mérite une célébration.
Veux-tu de la purée de pois ?
Non, merci.
La journée ne commence pas si bien,
si tu vois de quoi je parle.
Bien sûr, c'est peut-être les nerfs,
autant que la grossesse.
Les nerfs ?
Tu n'en as pas parlé à Eric ?
Il était si épuisé hier soir.
Et ce matin il s'est levé avant
que j'aie le temps.
- Tu sais où il a pu aller ?
- Non.
Lui et Jake étaient déjà partis
quand je suis descendue ce matin.
Gail...
tu ne penses pas qu'il...
enfin, les circonstances sont...
Tu parles de mon premier enfant.
Les circonstances sont idéales.
Dis-lui maintenant.
Ramenez du monde.
Il y a une ferme plus loin,
avec des camions en panne.
- Rapportez-les ici, ça fera une barricade.
- D'accord.
- Vous pensez que ça suffira ?
- C'est mieux que rien.
Ce n'est pas la première fois que vous
affrontez Ravenwood, hein ?
Pourquoi ?
Vous êtes parti à Rogue River,
et subitement ils se dirigent vers Jericho.
- Je vous pensais plus prudent.
- Vous pensez que je les ai attirés ici ?
- J'essaye juste de comprendre, Jake.
- Alors je vais être clair...
- Ma famille vit à Jericho.
- La mienne aussi.
- Je cherche uniquement à les protéger.
- Pareil.
Alors arrêtons de tourner en rond,
on a du boulot.
Qu'est-ce que je fais ?
- Em, tu es là ? C'est Heather.
- Ouais, un instant.
- Désolée de te déranger.
- C'est bon.
C'est pour toi.
C'est ce qui ressemblait le plus
à un bouquet de mariage.
Merci.
Je suis désolée, ça te gêne ?
Tu devais te marier aujourd'hui.
Il fallait que je fasse quelque chose.
Tu vois, pour marquer l'occasion.
En tant que demoiselle d'honneur.
Oublie-moi simplement, Ok ?
C'est très gentil de ta part.
Tu as prévu quelque chose aujourd'hui ?
A part ne pas me marier ?
Je pensais que je pourrais m'occuper
de toi toute la journée.
On pourrait aller se promener.
- Simplement marcher le long de la rivière.
- Je ne serais pas de bonne compagnie.
Il faut que tu aies de la compagnie.
- Evite de te morfondre.
- Je n'ai pas vraiment le choix, hein ?
Pas vraiment.
C'est bon.
On a besoin d'une autre voiture.
Mettez-la ici.
C'est pas la première fois que vous
avez à faire à eux non plus, hein  ?
- Il y a une chose que je voudrais
savoir, Jake.  - Quoi ?
Etes-vous conscient quand la
situation vous dépasse ?
- Tu es de retour.
- Juste un instant.
J'emporte ça à la Mairie.
Eric, attends. J'ai...
J'ai quelque chose à te dire.
D'accord.
Parlons.
Quand j'ai...
fait rédiger les papiers
pour le divorce,
je ne voyais aucun futur pour notre relation.
Mais maintenant, c'est différent.
Pas pour moi.
Quoi ?
Ecoute, la dernière chose que je souhaite
faire, c'est te faire du mal, April,
mais j'aime quelqu'un d'autre.
Qui ?
Mary Bailey.
April...
Ecoute, April...
- April, je suis désolé...
- Non, tu ne peux pas faire ça.
T'es qu'un enfoiré !
<i>Aux camions ! Vite !
Ils arrivent !</i>
Ils sont là.
Hé, ils sont là !
Revenez !
Courrez !
Allez, dépêchez-vous.
Ils arrivent, ils arrivent.
Allez, allez.
Foutez le camp.
En position, vérifiez vos munitions,
enlevez les sécurités.
Grouillez-vous !
- Souvenez-vous ce qu'on a dit !
- Personne ne tire avant que je le dise.
Et souvenez-vous...
La chose la plus importante à faire avant
de presser la détente est de respirer, OK ?
L'un de vous veut me parler ?
Quiconque soit votre chef,
cette route doit être dégagée.
Nous sommes envoyés par le
gouvernement pour collecter des provisions.
Respire.
Cessez le feu !
Cessez le feu !
Ecoutez-moi.
Nous sommes envoyés par le
gouvernement pour collecter des provisions.
Votre coopération est obligatoire.
Compris ?
Obligatoire.
Quand je reviendrai ici, il vaudrait
mieux que le pont soit dégagé.
Ou je m'en occuperai moi-même.
Vous avez quatre heures.
Compris ?
On y va.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va pouvoir faire ?
Il n'y a aucun moyen de tenir le pont.
Il va falloir qu'on le détruise.
Je suis d'accord.
Qu'est-ce que vous racontez ?
Il ne faut plus qu'il y ait de pont.
J'ai eu du mal avec M. Adams.
- Il t'a donné ses munitions sans rien dire ?
- Oh, il en a gardées plein.
Le studio de Guy ressemble
à la base d'Alamo.
- Où est-ce que je pose ça ?
- Dans la réserve d'armes.
- Eric...
- Pourquoi tu n'es pas au pont ?
Il faut qu'on parle.
- Impossible, on fera pas ça.
- Réfléchis ! Si on détruit le pont, on sera pas envahis.
Jusqu'à ce que Ravenwood arrive par un autre chemin.
Pas avant qu'ils passent New Bern
ou une autre ville.
- Mieux vaut eux que nous.
- Ca nous fera gagner du temps.
On pourra utiliser tous nos hommes
pour sécuriser les autres routes.
J'arrive pas à y croire.
Si on détruit ce pont,
on le reconstruira pas.
Vous pensez qu'on s'en sortira sans ?
Et les fermes de l'autre côté ?
C'est le seul accès en hiver.
Il y a des fermes plus près de la ville.
OK, et ces maisons que vous allez isoler ?
- Jake, on isole Stanley.
- Ils viendront de ce côté.
- Ecoutez, il doit y avoir un autre moyen.
- Ravenwood va revenir.
On n'a pas le temps.
Tu proposes quoi ?
Il nous faut plus d'hommes,
mettez-les aux avants postes s'il faut.
Envoyer plus d'hommes, c'est subir plus de pertes.
Bill...
Enferme les explosifs.
- Attends une minute...
- Rien n'arrivera à ce pont.
On peut les contrer avec tout
ce qu'on rassemblera.
- Comment peux-tu... ?
- La réponse est non.
Je vais chez Gracie prendre de l'huile,
du cirage, du dentifrice, ce qu'il restera.
Oh, et si le moteur se met à tousser,
accélère un peu pour ne pas caler.
Et garde un oeil sur la température.
Si l'aiguille va dans le rouge,
coupe le moteur,
parce qu'il te reste environ deux secondes
avant que ça n'explose, OK ?
- Pour... pourquoi je peux pas y aller ?
- Oh, non, non, non.
Je ne veux pas que tu aies d'ennui.
D'accord.
Hé, la Lune, ici la Terre,
tu attends quoi ?
Allez, on y va.
Alors, ça y est.
Tu es prête ?
Pourquoi ? J'en ai pas l'air ?
Si, tu es parfaite pour l'occasion.
Alors, allons-y !
Qu'est-ce que t'attends, Em?
Emily...
Emily...
Emily...
Emily!
Em... Em, Em, coupe le moteur.
- Coupe le moteur.
- Je suis désolée.
- Il y avait ce camion avec des gars armés.
- Ouais.
Euh, on ne va pas faire de randonnée aujourd'hui.
Tout le monde est supposé rester à l'abri.
Quelque chose se passe à l'extérieur de la ville.
- Toutes les routes sont bloquées.
- Rentrons chez nous.
"Chez nous" ?
Ils n'ont pas dit "chez nous".
Ils ont dit "à l'abri".
Heather, je, euh...
Hé, écoute, c'est pas
la fin du monde, d'accord ?
Parce que c'est déjà arrivé.
Qu'est-ce qu'on doit faire ?
On va passer directement à
la deuxième étape.
- J'ai trouvé deux fusées de détresse.
- Bien.
Mettez deux hommes en position
à deux kilomètres du pont,
donnez leur les fusées,
et dites leur d'envoyer le signal
quand Ravenwood sera en vue.
Gray, je vais rassembler autant
d'essence et d'engrais que possible.
Je vous retrouve au pont.
Il fabrique des explosifs ?
- Alors vous le détruisez quand même ?
- C'est exact.
Ecoute, Jake, tu es loyal envers ton frère
et ta famille, je comprends.
Si tu veux te retirer,
personne ne t'en voudra.
Mais ce pont va s'écrouler.
Où tu vas ?
Quelqu'un doit dire aux gens qui
vivent là-bas de revenir en ville.
- Alors c'est ça l'étape deux ?
- Ouais.
Salut, vous avez entendu pour
le pont de Tacoma ?
Ouais, pourquoi penses-tu qu'on a annulé
la partie sportive de la journée ? Les clés ?
Euh, je ne connais pas le plan,
mais je sais pas si c'est
une bonne idée.
C'est quoi le plan exactement ?
C'est peut-être la dernière bouteille de Scotch
que l'on verra avant un bon bout de temps.
Si tu le dis, on l'ouvre !
Mais si on l'ouvre, on ne part pas
tant qu'elle n'est pas finie.
Donc l'étape deux, c'est qu'on
finisse complètement saoules ?
Plus ou moins.
Ca marche pour moi.
Il est là depuis ce matin.
Je le plains.
Il semblerait qu'il ait eu
deux semaines éprouvantes.
Mesdames.
Alors qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
J'en dis "Et puis merde !".
Je retrouve la fille que je connais.
Qui prendra les fusées de détresse ?
Stanton Broksmier.
Vous faites sauter le pont ?
Les Miller seront là dans une heure.
Leur vieille Nova fonctionne.
Vous pourrez monter avec eux.
- Va faire ton sac.
- Non.
Ne discute pas avec moi.
Quand cette voiture arrivera, tu monteras dedans.
Maintenant, vas-y !
Et toi ?
Je reste.
Ne sois pas stupide, Stanley.
Ils reviennent.
Jake, je les retiendrai.
Je l'ai déjà fait.
Il n'y aura pas seulement quelques
hommes cette fois.
Ils n'ont laissé que des cadavres
à Rogue River.
Tu veux finir comme ça ?
Stanley, s'il te plait, ne te fais pas
tuer pour une maison.
Hey, mon grand-père a construit cette
maison à partir de rien.
Et la chambre où tu as dormi...
C'était celle de mon père quand il était petit.
Ils ont mis ça dans ton fichier d'audit ?
Je ne vais pas abandonner sans me battre.
Si on avait des gardes,
des personnes entraînées,
on pourrait leur faire face,
mais c'est pas le cas.
Une fois le pont explosé, quiconque sera de
ce coté sera livré à lui-même.
OK, alors va prévenir les gens.
Tu perds ton temps ici.
Ils sont là.
Prends tes affaires.
Je ne pars pas.
C'est aussi ma maison.
- Bonnie, tu n'es pas en sécurité ici.
- Je n'ai pas peur.
- Bonnie... Ne discute pas avec moi.
- Tout ira bien si on reste ensemble.
Stanley.
- Elle ne part pas ?
- Je ne peux pas la forcer.
Tu risques sa vie... et la tienne.
- Je ne comprends pas, Stanley.
- Parce que c'est pas ta famille.
Bonnie a grandi dans cette maison,
nous l'avons fait tous les deux.
Cette maison est son seul lien avec une mère
et un père dont elle se souvient à peine.
C'est étrange, je pensais que
c'était toi ce lien.
Bonne chance.
Santé.
C'est votre commandant qui vous parle.
- Nous sommes dans une zone de turbulence.
- Tu vas bien ?
Je vais super bien.
Hé... toi là.
Mr. Sombre et Intriguant.
Garde un oeil sur ma copine jusqu'à
mon retour et je te paye un verre.
Votre amie est en pleine forme, hein ?
Je peux ?
- Alors, c'est votre anniversaire ?
- Non.
Je...
Non.
Au secret alors.
C'est pas terrible là-dehors, hein ?
Oh, pauvreté, meurtre, maladie.
C'est vraiment misérable.
Désolé. Désolé.
- J'ai bu, et j'ai pas dormi depuis des semaines.
- Pareil pour moi.
- T'as tout pris, c'est bon ?
- On vient de charger la dernière boîte.
Bill, qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ici ?
Je suis désolé, Eric.
Je m'en charge, Bill.
- Où est la putain de dynamite ?
- La décision est prise.
- On fait sauter le pont.  - Qui ça "on" ?
- Moi, Hawkins, les adjoints... et ton frère.
- Hé !
- Je dois parler à Papa.
- Non, tu vas me parler tout de suite.
- J'ai pas le temps.
April m'a raconté.
Maman, je ne voulais pas que
les choses prennent cette tournure.
Vraiment, et tu voulais que
ça se passe comment ?
Tu as choisi de ne pas t'occuper de ton mariage.
- Tu as choisi de tromper ta femme.
- J'essaie de faire ce qu'il y a de mieux.
- Je sais que l'on ne dirait pas...
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Johnston...
- Papa...
Les mercenaires de Rogue River,
ils nous ont suivis.
On a un point de contrôle au pont de Tacoma
et je pense qu'on peut le défendre.
mais il y a un plan visant à le détruire
et isoler la ville.
Gray Anderson ?
Ouais, il est dehors en train de l'équiper.
- Où sont Jimmy et Bill?
- Dehors en train d'aider Gray.
- Papa, je suis tout seul.
- Va chercher ton frère et arrêtez-les.
Jake est avec eux, aussi.
Alors tu les arrêtes.
Qu'importe la manière, tu les arrêtes.
Coûte que coûte.
- Comment ça se passe ?
- Plus que quelques fils.
Dépêchez-vous les gars.
OK tout le monde, continuez d'avancer !
Il faut maintenir l'allure.
On doit continuer à avancer.
- Si on voit le signal, ça sera trop tard.
- John, j'ai besoin du camion. S'il te plait.
On n'a plus beaucoup de temps, messieurs.
OK, c'est bon.
Attache les à ça.
Assure toi que les lignes ne se croisent pas.
- Eloigne bien le doré du bleu.
- Jake.
Je l'ai. Ouais, ouais.
Eric...
Tiens, c'est la ligne principale.
- Papa veut que ça s'arrête.
- Papa n'a pas toutes les informations.
- C'est quand même ce qu'il demande, Jake.
- Il est pas là pour le faire.
Eric...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Je vais arrêter tout ça.
On pourrait voir le signal
à n'importe quel moment.
Tu seras isolé.
Tu ne peux pas aller là-bas, OK ?
Eric !
Oh merde !
C'est le signal !
- Ils arrivent !  - On a deux minutes.
- Ravenwood arrive.
On doit toujours relier la ligne principale.
Eric est de l'autre côté.
On n'a pas le temps, Jake.
Fais sortir tout le monde du pont.
- Partez aussi loin que vous pouvez.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Partez ! Maintenant ! Partez !
Par ici les gars !
Par ici !
Tout le monde dégage du pont !
Partez aussi loin que possible !
On va le faire sauter !
Allez !
Pas mal. Pas mal cette fois.
Donc je viens de...
de commencer mon entraînement.
- Je suis dans ce pays depuis 6 mois.
- Où ?
Las Vegas.
Ne rigolez pas, ne rigolez pas !
C'est une ville merveilleuse.
C'est vraiment un endroit merveilleux.
Ce n'est pas si merveilleux
sans eau et sans électricité.
Je me suis pratiquement jeté dans les
bras de la Croix-Rouge pour en sortir.
Un geste noble, mais dont le but
était de sauver mes fesses !
Vous avez fait ce que vous aviez à faire.
Alors, ils m'ont envoyé dans
le Kansas... et me voilà.
Je devrais être assis au bord d'une piscine,
entouré de belles femmes.
Des rousses, de préférence,
et des blondes, des blondes aussi.
Ouais, fumer un cigare,
vivre le rêve Américain.
- J'étais censée me marier aujourd'hui.
- Vraiment ?
J'aurais dû être là...
juste à cet endroit.
Les pieds sur la table, à boire un verre.
- Emily !
- Ouais ?
- Tu veux que je mette quoi après ?
- La même.
"Polyester Bride" en boucle ?
Je vous trouve ironique le jour
de votre mariage, Emily Sullivan !
Si j'étais ironique,
je te demanderais Alanis..
Et ce sera Emily Hammond,
dans environ... 30 minutes.
Hé, viens-là.
On a besoin d'un coup de main, d'accord ?
Heather, je ne peux pas partir
avec tout ce monde dans le bar.
Tu laisses ton téléphone allumé,
que je suive le mariage ?
Pas de problème.
- Stanley, tu vas t'habiller quand ?
- A la fin du match.
Le mariage est dans une demi-heure.
Oh non ! Prolongation !
Pourquoi ?
Avant qu'on se dirige vers l'église,
je voudrais porter un toast à la mariée
qui rougit et au garçon de la banque.
L'homme de la banque.
Bon, de toute façon c'est un banquier.
Qui aurait pensé que Roger et
Emily iraient ensemble ?
C'est un investissement à haut risque !
Il n'y a aucun risque avec lui.
Tout à fait.
A Emily et Roger.
Qu'ils vivent heureux ensemble
pour l'éternité.
Sans remises en question,
sans s'épier mutuellement,
et sans se demander s'ils étaient faits
pour une autre vie.
Santé, tout le monde.
A l'avenir.
Repose en paix.
Mais que fait-il ?
Il va les arrêter.
Le pont est miné.
Vous êtes garés au-dessus
d'un kilo de dynamite.
Faites demi-tour,
ou je fais tout sauter.
Sur ordre du Gouvernement, nous
collectons des vivres et des médicaments
pour le camp de réfugiés de Rogue River.
Le même Gouvernement qui vous a ordonné
de tuer tous ces gens à l'hôpital ?
Ces dernières semaines ont été
difficiles, c'est le chaos.
Ecartez-vous, nous prendrons ce que
nous voulons et nous partirons.
Allez-y, donnez l'ordre.
Si je meurs, vous mourrez.
Il y a quelque chose de drôle ?
Ouais... tout ça.
Vous n'appuierez pas sur ce bouton.
Voilà comment ça va se passer.
Vous et vos amis paysans baissez vos armes,
on remonte dans nos véhicules,
on va en ville chercher ce dont on a
besoin, et on ne reviendra jamais.
Personne n'a besoin de mourir.
Un homme à terre !
Un homme à terre !
Vous allez avoir besoin de beaucoup
plus de snipers, mon pote.
Des voitures arrivent !
En position, maintenant !
- C'est Jonah Prowse?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il peut bien foutre ici ?
Que représente cette ville pour vous ?
Vous savez... bientôt les choses vont
redevenir comme avant.
Le gouvernement va se rétablir.
Et ils essaieront de tous vous aider.
Et vous savez qui ils enverront ?
Moi.
Allons-y !
La prochaine fois que tu veux couper
la route qui me permet de venir en ville,
j'apprécierais que tu me tiennes au courant.
De rien.
Vraiment. Pas la peine de me remercier.
Puis-je vous faire une suggestion ?
Vous devriez trouver un moyen
de vous défendre par vous-même.
Si Eric n'était pas venu me chercher,
vous auriez tous pu enterrer Jake demain.
Alors c'est comme ça que ça va être ?
Des journées à boire, des nuits solitaires, et
la vision dérangeante d'une fiancée morte ?
Es-tu...?
Quoi ?
Mort ?
Ca te faciliterait les choses ?
Non.
Je n'en sais rien.
Je ne me souviens même plus du son
de ta voix, ça fait tellement longtemps.
J'aurais dû prendre cet avion avec toi.
Tu n'aurais jamais quitté cet endroit.
Tu ne t'es jamais demandée pourquoi ?
Un frère, une mère décédée.
Un père qui n'en était pas vraiment un.
Et c'est ça qui te retient à Jéricho ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je pense que si.
Em ?
Ca va ?
- Que se passera-t-il s'ils reviennent ?
Nous avons posté des sentinelles armées.
Et s'il faut en arriver là, le pont
est toujours miné.
Je pense toujours que nous
devrions le faire sauter maintenant.
Et bien, ce n'est pas toi qui décides, Gray.
- Ravi de vous revoir sur pieds, Johnston.
- Monsieur le Maire.
Et maintenant j'aimerais bien que
quelqu'un me dise qui est le chef ici.
Si nous sommes touchés de l'autre côté, ce pont
pourrait être le seul moyen de nous en tirer.
Il y a des gens pour nous aider
de l'autre côté de ce pont.
Notre peuple - le monde entier -
est de l'autre côté de ce pont.
Si nous détruisons ce pont,
nous sommes perdus d'avance.
Tout le monde ici va dans ce sens.
Y compris votre fils.
Non.
Pas tout le monde.
Si vous trouvez une vraie solution pour
sauver cette ville, faites-le moi savoir.
- Papa, je pense que tu devrais...
- Toi, pas un mot.
Je suis le seul ici à avoir été élu.
Je ne ferai pas cela.
C'est aussi simple que ça.
Il est peut-être temps de décider si c'est
toujours à vous de prendre les décisions.
Stanley ?
Non, je ne veux pas qu'elle vienne.
Tu n'es qu'un idiot.
Oui. Elle a dit que c'était bon pour elle.
Très bien.
J'attends dehors.
Je t'ai plutôt mis en mauvaise
posture, là-dehors, hein ?
Gray s'est servi de toi, fiston.
J'espère que tu l'as compris.
Papa, tu n'as pas vu
de quoi ces gars sont capables.
- Je ne suis pas ici pour me battre.
- Pourquoi es-tu là, alors ?
On a besoin d'une force de sécurité.
Une vraie force armée, bien entraînée.
Que tu auras autorisée.
Cela appartenait à ton grand-père.
Il l'avait sur lui quand il a été
parachuté le jour J.
Quand il a dû prendre la tête de son peloton,
ce livre et l'entraînement qu'il a reçu lui ont permis
d'aller en Allemagne après Omaha Beach.
Je me souviens de cette histoire.
Assure-toi de prendre
les bonnes décisions.
Je ne rentrerai pas ce soir.
Je passerai demain pour prendre mes vêtements.
- Ecoute, maman, April... - Pourra rester
chez nous aussi longtemps qu'elle le voudra.
Merci, Jimmy.
On a fait du beau boulot, aujourd'hui.
Non.
Non, on a juste eu de la chance.
Emily ?
Tout va bien ?
Oui.
J'ai vu Heather.
Elle est complètement à l'ouest.
Je crois que j'ai bien abusé moi aussi.
Je sais quel jour nous
sommes aujourd'hui.
Ma mère a toujours l'invitation
sur son frigo.
Tu sais, on n'a jamais parlé de lui.
Roger.
Que veux-tu savoir ?
Comment a-t-il fait sa demande ?
Verres en cristal et caviar.
Je peux aller me coucher avec
ma demande au whisky sur un parking.
Nous n'étions que des gosses.
Comment aurions-nous pu savoir ?
On en savait assez pour
ne pas aller au bout.
Pourquoi es-tu revenu, Jake ?
Pourquoi ne pouvais-tu pas
rester loin de moi ?
Es-tu sûre que c'est ce que tu voulais ?
Pardon ?
Es-tu sûre que c'est ce que tu voulais ?

It's straight up 8:00
on a perfect autumn morning.
So get up, get out of bed...
You heard the man.
Rise and shine, babe.
I thought we were gonna sleep in.
- We did, got up at 6:00.
- Oh, Roger.
Maybe this wedding isn't such a good idea.
Still have a few hours to change your mind.
- If you come back to bed, I won't.
- Oh, Emily, I wish.
Got to meet the folks.
Apparently, they're not all that thrilled
about their accommodations.
'Cause they're only in the best
bed-and-breakfast in town.
Yeah, well, when you're used to staying
at the Pierre overlooking Central Park...
Do you think your parents will
ever get used to a small town girl
stealing away their big city boy?
Sure.
Soon as we move back to civilization.
Right.
Noise and traffic and pollution.
Don't forget about the crime.
I'm not kidding, Roger.
This is it.
When we're married, this is where we live.
Sure that's what you want?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sure it's what you want?
Roger. Roger! Roger! Roger.
We're filling up the hummers now.
- What's that?
- Some one in the window.
There's someone here.
Hey!
What the hell are you guys doing out there?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Sorry, we didn't want to knock at this hour.
- Stanley, what's going on?
- Go back inside and lock the door.
You're on private property.
This isn't a gas station.
I'll see to it you're reimbursed, sir.
- We work for the federal government.
- Yeah, what kind of work?
Just making sure folks have
everything they need--
medical supplies, clean water, food.
A friend of mine told me to look
him up if we came through.
You know Eric Green?
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Thanks for the fill-up.
Hey.
You stay down here all night?
Thought I'd keep an eye out, just in case.
- Listen, Jake, yesterday when
you talked about where you been...
- How'd it go with April?
Did you tell her about you and Mary?
Didn't think it was the right time.
Yeah, it's never gonna be.
Eric...
Hey, come in.
Hey.
Sorry to come by so early.
We were awake.
What's up?
Some guys showed up at the farm last night.
Couple Humvees, guns.
- They knew Eric's name.
- Ravenwood.
Who?
Mercenaries.
We ran across them in Rogue River.
Okay, well, what the hell do they want?
Everything.
- Ravenwood? What the hell is that?
- It's a private security firm.
They hire thugs and army dropouts
They give them big guns and
send them out to play soldier.
- What are they doing in Kansas?
- FEMA hired them to evacuate Rogue River.
But now they're in business for themselves.
They stripped the town of all their supplies
they killed police and civilians.
You've heard of these guys?
- Now they want to hit Jericho.
- I think they were scouts.
- Probably want to know if we're worth a
visit. - We should fortify, just in case.
- Shore up our borders at
the most vulnerable points.
- Already there.
- I ordered armed checked points
on Cherry Valley Road and Route 660.
- Check points?
Yeah, keep track of who's coming into town.
The mayor was sick, you were gone,
I figured it shouldn't wait.
They'll probably come from the east
across the Tacoma Bridge.
I think we should block it.
My farm is on the other side of that bridge.
- And so's 30 other families. - Everyone
on that side will have to come into town.
- It's not safe to stay over there. - Over
there. You want me to abandon my farm?
- Jake, you've got to be kidding.
- Just for now, Stanley.
Bill, get some guys together,
start collecting ammo.
Whatever they're willing to part with.
- We'll stockpile it here.
- I still have some explosives at the mine.
We'll take anything you got.
Morning, April.
I thought I could get
Johnston to eat something.
No, it's better to let him sleep.
Let his body adjust to the meds.
Oh, okay.
- You ready for some more good news?
- Are you kidding?
His blood pressure's stabilizing.
And the fever seems to be resolving.
I think he's going to be okay.
Well, that calls for a real celebration.
Can I offer you some mashed black-eyed peas?
None for me.
It hasn't been a particularly good morning
if you know what I mean.
'Course, it could be the nerves
as much as the pregnancy.
Nerves? You didn't tell Eric yet?
Oh, he was just so exhausted last night.
And then he was up and gone
before I had the chance.
- Any idea where he went?
- No.
He and Jake were both gone
when I came downstairs this morning.
Gail...
do you think he'll...
well, the timing just seems so...
You're talking about my first grandchild.
The timing couldn't be better.
Now tell him.
Get as many guys as you can.
There's a farm up the road
with a couple of dead trucks.
- Bring them back here,
we'll use them as a barricade.
- Got it.
- You think that'll make a difference?
- It's better than nothing.
This isn't your first run-in
with Ravenwood, is it?
Why?
You go off on your road trip
all of a sudden they're headed for Jericho.
Would've thought you'd
be more careful is all.
You think I led them here on purpose?
Hey, I'm just trying to put
the pieces together, Jake.
Well, let me make it easy for you.
- My family lives in Jericho.
- So does mine.
- Everything I do, I do to protect them.
- Same here, man.
Well, then let's stop screwing
around and get it done.
What am I doing?
- Em, you in there?
It's Heather.
- Yeah, just a second.
- Sorry to barge in.
- That's okay.
These are for you.
- Closest thing I could find
to a wedding bouquet. - Thanks.
I'm sorry, is this weird?
You were supposed to get married today.
I figured I should do something special.
You know, to acknowledge the day.
Maid of honor and all.
Just ignore me, okay?
This is really sweet, what you did.
You got any plans for today?
Besides not getting married?
'Cause I kind of planned a whole day
to keep you occupied.
I thought we'd start with a hike.
- Nothing exotic,
just a hike along the river.
- I don't think I'm gonna be great company.
Company's kind of the point.
- Keep moping to a minimum.
- I don't really have a choice, do I?
Not so much.
Good.
Okay, we're gonna need another car.
Put it here.
Let me guess-- this isn't your first run-in
with these guys either, is it?
- You know, there's only one thing I
need to know from you, Jake.
- What?
Would you even know when
you're in over your head?
- Hey, you're back.
- Yeah.
Just for a second.
Got to get this stuff to town hall.
Eric, wait.
I have...
I have something to tell you.
Okay.
Let's talk.
When I, uh... had the divorce papers drafted
I did that because I couldn't see
a future for us.
But now I can.
I can't.
What?
Look, the last thing I want to do
on this Earth is to hurt you, April...
but I'm in love with someone else.
Who?
Mary Bailey.
April...
Look, April...
- April, I'm sorry...
- No, you don't get to do this.
You son of a bitch.
Get the trucks! Let's go!
They're coming!
They're here.
Hey, they're here!
Come on, back.
Just run!
Come on, hustle.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, move. Move.
Everybody keep moving.
Check your positions, check
your clips, safety's off.
Come on, everybody!
- Remember what we talked about!
- Nobody fires until I say so.
And everybody remember all right?
The most important thing to do before
squeezing the trigger is to breathe, okay?
Somebody here want to talk to me?
Whoever's in charge,
this road needs to be cleared.
We're under government
orders to collect supplies.
Breathe.
Cease fire.
Cease fire.
Listen up.
We're here on government
orders to collect supplies.
Your cooperation is mandatory?
Understood?
Mandatory.
When I get back here,
this bridge better be cleared.
Or I'll clear it myself.
You got four hours.
Understood?
Let's roll.
What the hell are we going to do?
There's no way we can hold this bridge.
We're going to have to take it out.
I agree.
What are you saying?
There can't be a bridge.
I struck gold with Mr. Adams.
- He gave up all that ammo without fight?
- Oh, he kept plenty.
Guy's rec room looks like
the basement of the Alamo.
- Where do you want this?
- In the gun locker.
Eric...
Why aren't you at the bridge?
We need to talk.
- No way, we're not doing it.
- Think about it-- with the bridge gone,
we can't be overrun.
Until Ravenwood turns around and
comes at us from another direction.
Not before they pass New Bern
or some other town.
- Better them than us.
- This will buy us time.
Then we focus our manpower and resources
on securing the other roads.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
If we destroy that bridge,
it is gone forever.
Do you think we can do without it?
What about the farms on the other side?
- Access to the food for winter.
- There are farms closer to town.
Okay, what about the homes you'll isolate?
- Jake, that means cutting off Stanley.
- They'll have to come over.
- Look, there has to be a better way.
- Ravenwood is coming back right now.
We've got no time.
What do you suggest?
We can get more men.
- Pull them off the outposts if we have to.
- Send more men out there, you're
going to get more men killed.
Bill...
lock up the explosives.
- Now wait a minute...
- Nothing happens to that bridge.
We can face them with
whatever we can muster.
- How can you...?!
- The answer is no.
Okay, I'm just going to go into Gracie's
and get some trail mix, or, you know,
shoe polish, dental floss, whatever's left.
Oh, and if the engine starts to shake
just slide over and gun the gas.
And keep your eye on the temperature.
If the needle hits the red, cut the gas,
'cause you've got about two seconds before
it's about to explode.
Okay?
- Why-why can't I just go in?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want you to go through the trouble.
Right.
Hey, space cadet, what are you waiting for?
Come on, let's go.
So, this is it.
You ready?
Why, don't I look ready?
Well, you're definitely
dressed for the occasion.
So, yeah, let's roll.
What are you waiting for, Em?
Emily...
Emily...
Emily...
Emily!
Em... Em, Em, turn it off.
- Turn it off.
- I'm sorry.
- There was a truck with
these guys with guns. - Yeah.
Um, we're not hiking today.
Everybody's supposed to stay indoors.
Something's going on outside of town.
- All the roads are blocked.
- Let's go home.
Home? They didn't say "home."
They said "indoors."
Heather, I, uh...
Hey, look, it's not
the end of the world, right?
'Cause that already happened.
What should we do?
We're going to proceed
directly to phase two.
- I found two flare guns.
- Good.
Position a couple of
guys maybe two miles out.
Give them the flare guns.
Tell them to send up a signal
when they have Ravenwood in sight.
Gray, I'm going to round up as
much diesel and fertilizer as I can.
I'll meet you back at the bridge.
He's making explosives?
- So you're blowing it anyway?
- That's right.
Look, Jake, you got loyalty to your brother
and your family, I get that.
So if you want to bow out,
no one will blame you.
But that bridge is coming down.
Where are you going?
Someone's got to tell those people
who live out there to come over.
- So this is phase two?
- Yep.
Hey, you guys here about
that thing at Tacoma Bridge?
Yeah, why do you think we nixed
the healthy portion of today's program?
Keys please.
Uh, I don't know what that plan is
but I don't know if it's such a good idea.
What exactly is the plan?
This may be the last bottle of single
malt Scotch Kansas sees in a long time.
You say the word, we open it.
But if we do, you're not leaving
till it's finished.
So phase two is that we get
completely obliterated?
More or less
Works for me.
He's been here since this morning.
I felt bad for him.
It sounds like he's had
a rough couple of weeks.
Ladies.
So what do you say?
I say what the hell.
That's my girl.
Who's on lookout for the flares?
Stanton Broksmier.
You're blowing up the bridge?
The Millers will be here in an hour.
They got their old Nova working.
You can ride with them.
- Go pack your bag.
- No.
Don't argue with me.
When that car gets here,
you're going to be in it.
Now go.
And what about you?
I'm staying.
Don't be stupid, Stanley.
They're coming back.
Jake, I'll hold them off.
I did it before.
Look, it's going to be a
couple of guys this time.
They left a pile of bodies in Rogue River.
You want to wind up like that?
Stanley, please don't get yourself
killed for a house.
Hey, my grandfather built this house
from the ground up.
And that room you've been sleeping in...
That was my dad's room when he was a kid.
They put that in your audit file?
I'm not about to give it up without a fight.
If we had guardsmen,
people who were trained--
we could take a stand, but we don't.
Once we blow that bridge, everyone who's
on this side of it is on their own.
Okay, so go warn people.
You're wasting time here.
They're here.
Get your stuff.
I'm not leaving.
This is my home, too.
- Bonnie, it is not safe for you here.
- I'm not afraid.
- Bonnie... don't argue with me.
- We'll be okay if we stay together.
Stanley.
- She's not going?
- I can't force her.
You're risking her life-- and yours.
- I don't get it, Stanley.
- Because it's not your family.
Bonnie grew up in this house, we both did.
This house is her only connection to a
mother and father she barely even remembers.
That's funny, I though you were
that connection.
Good luck.
Skoal.
Ah!
Oh...
Whoa.
This is your captain speaking.
- We are experiencing minor turbulence.
- Are you okay?
I am awesome.
Hey.
You there.
Mr. Dark and Intriguing.
Keep my friend company till I get back
and there's a shot in it for you.
Your friend is spicy, huh?
May I?
- So it's your birthday?
- No.
I...
No.
To privacy then.
Pretty bad out there, isn't it?
Oh, poverty, murder, disease.
It's bloody miserable.
Sorry. Sorry.
- I am drunk, and I haven't slept in weeks.
- Me, too.
- Sent everything out, right?
- The last box just went out on the truck.
Bill, what's going on here?
I'm sorry, Eric.
I got this, Bill.
- Where the hell's the dynamite?!
- The decisions been made.
- We're blowing the bridge.
- Who's "we"? - Myself, Robert Hawkins,
the deputies... and your brother.
- Hey.
- I've got to talk to Dad.
- No, you will talk to me right now.
- I don't have time.
April told me.
- Mom, I didn't mean for things to
turn out this way. - Oh, really? How
did you mean for things to turn out?
You're the one who chose not
to work on your marriage.
- You're the one who chose
to cheat on your wife.
- I am trying to do the right thing.
- I know it doesn't seem that way
right now... - What's going on?
- Johnston...
- Dad...
The mercenaries from Rogue River,
they followed us back.
We have a checkpoint at the Tacoma
Bridge and I think we can defend it
but there's this plan to destroy
it and cut off the town.
Gray Anderson?
Yeah, he's out there right now wiring it.
- Where are Jimmy and Bill?
- Out there helping Gray.
- Dad, I'm alone I'm this one.
- Get your brother and stop them.
Jake is with them, too.
Then you stop them.
Whatever it takes, you stop them.
Whatever it takes.
- How's it coming?
- Just a few wires left.
Hurry guys.
All right, everybody, keep it moving!
We got to keep up the pace.
We gotta keep moving.
- We see that flare,
it's going to be too late.
- John, I need to borrow your truck. Please.
We don't have much time, folks.
All right, good.
Hold on to that.
Make sure the lines don't cross.
- Keep the gold away from the blue.
- Jake.
Got it. Yeah, yeah.
Eric...
Here, run this to the trunk.
- Dad wants this stopped. - Well,
Dad doesn't have all the information.
- It's still his call, Jake.
- Well, here's not here to make it.
Eric...
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting an end to this.
We could see that flare any minute.
You'll be cut off.
You can't go out there, all right?
Eric!
Oh, my God.
That's the flare!
- They're coming!
- We got two minutes.
- Ravenwood is coming.
Still have to run the trunk line.
Eric's out there.
There's no time, Jake.
Get everybody off the bridge.
- Get as far away as you can.
- What are you doing?
Go! Go now! Go!
Come on, guys!
Come on! Everybody off the bridge!
Get as far away as you can!
We're gonna do it!
We're gonna blow it!
Come on!
Not bad. Not bad this time.
So I had just... just started my practice.
- Been in the country for about six months.
- Where?
Las Vegas.
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.
It's a wonderful town.
It's really a wonderful place.
It's not quite so wonderful
without water and electricity.
Practically threw myself
at the Red Cross to get out.
A noble gesture, designed to save
my own ass.
You did what you had to do.
So, they sent me to Kansas, and here I am.
I really should be sitting by a pool
surrounded by beautiful women.
Redheads, preferably.
And blondes. Blondes, too.
Yeah, smoking a cigar,
living the American dream.
- I was supposed to be married today.
- Really?
I was going to be right...
right over there.
Feet kicked up, having a drink.
- Emily!
- Yeah?
- What do you want to hear next?
- Same one.
"Polyester Bride" on endless loop?
Are you being ironic on your wedding day,
Emily Sullivan?
If I was being ironic, it would Alanis.
And it's Emily Hammond in, like,
30 minutes.
Hey, hold on there.
We need extra hands, okay?
Heather, there's no way I can
leave with the bar this busy.
- Can you hold the phone up during
the wedding so I can hear?
- Got you programmed.
- Hey, Stanley, when are you
getting dressed? - After the game.
The wedding is in a half an hour.
Oh! Overtime?! Why?!
Before we head over to the church
I'd like to make a toast to the
blushing bride and banker boy.
Banker man.
Well, it's a banker any way you slice it.
Who here would have ever matched Roger
with Emily?
Talk about high-risk investment.
There's nothing risky about him.
Exactly.
To Emily and Roger.
May they live happily together
in eternal blandness.
Never questioning their life
never looking too closely.
Never wondering if they weren't meant
for something else.
Down the hatch, everybody.
To the future.
Rest in peace.
What does he think he's doing?
He's making a stand.
The bridge is wired.
You just parked over a couple
of pounds of dynamite.
Turn your trucks around or I blow it.
We're on government orders to
collect food and medicine for a
refuge camp near the Rogue River.
Same government that ordered you
to kill all those people in the hospital?
It's been a crazy few weeks.
A lot of confusion out there.
Just step aside, we'll take what
we need and be on our way.
Go ahead.
give the order.
If I go, you go.
Is something funny?
Yeah, this whole thing.
You're not going to push that button.
Here's how it's going to go.
You and your farmer buddies,
you stand down, we get back in our vehicles,
we drive into town take what we need
and never come back.
Nobody has to die.
Man down!
Man down!
You're gonna need a lot more snipers, pal.
We got cars coming!
Get in positions, now!
- Is that Jonah Prowse?
- What the hell's he doing here?
What's this town worth to you?
You know, pretty soon, things are going
to start to get back to normal.
The government will put
itself back together.
And they'll be looking to help
all of you get back on your feet.
And you know who they're going to send?
Me.
Let's go!
Next time you want to destroy my
route into town
I'd appreciate a head's up.
You're welcome.
Really.
Don't mention it.
Can I make a suggestion?
Start figuring out how to
fight for yourselves.
If Eric hadn't come to get me, you'd
all be burying Jake in a shoebox tomorrow.
So is this how it's going to be?
Drunken days, lonely nights,
disturbing visions of a dead fiance?
Are you...?
What?
Dead?
Would that make it easier?
No.
I don't know.
I don't even know what your voice
sounds like, it's been so long.
I should have been on the plane with you.
You never would have left this place.
Ever ask yourself why?
Brother, mother gone.
No father to speak of.
What is it that keeps
you so tied to Jericho?
I don't know.
I think you do.
Em?
You okay?
- What happens if they come back?
- Yeah!
- We've got armed sentries posted.
- If it comes to it,
the bridge is still wired.
I still say we take it out now.
Well, you're not calling the shots, Gray.
- I'm glad to see you up on
your feet, Johnston. - Mayor.
Now, maybe one of you would
like to tell me just exactly
who you think is in charge here.
If we're hit from the other side, that
bridge might be our only line of retreat.
Help is on the other side of that bridge.
Our people-- the whole world--
is on the other side of that bridge.
We destroy that bridge, we've already lost.
Everyone here wants this to happen.
Including your son.
No.
Not everyone.
You guys come up with a real plan
to protect this town, you let me know.
- Dad, I think you should...
- You hold your tongue.
I'm the only one here who was elected.
I will not do this.
It is as simple as that.
Maybe it's time we let the people decide if
they still want you making their decisions.
Stanley?
No, she can't. She can't.
You're an idiot.
Yeah. She said it's fine with her.
Right.
I'll be outside.
I kind of put you in a bad
position out there, huh?
Gray used you, son.
I hope you see that.
Dad, you didn't see what those guys
are capable of.
- But I'm not here to fight.
- What are you here for?
We need a security force.
A real one. Trained.
Sanctioned by you.
This belonged to your grandfather.
He had it on him when he landed at D-day.
When he had to take command of his platoon,
that manual and his training got him
from Omaha Beach into Germany.
I remember the story.
Make sure you do it right.
I'm not coming home tonight.
I'll stop by tomorrow and pack some clothes.
- Look, Mom, April... - Will have a
home with us as long as she wants one.
Thanks, Jimmy.
We did good today.
No.
No, we just got lucky.
Emily?
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
I saw Heather.
She's pretty wasted.
I've been a little over-served myself.
I know what today is.
My mom, she still has
the invitation on the fridge.
You know, we never talked about him.
About Roger.
What do you want to know?
How did he propose?
Cristal and caviar.
Beats the hell out of malt liquor
in a video store parking lot.
We were teenagers.
What the hell did we know?
Knew enough not to go through with it.
Why did you come back, Jake?
Hmm?
Why couldn't you have just stayed away?
Are you sure that's what you wanted?
What did you just say?
Are you sure that's what you wanted?
<i>Précédemment dans Jericho</i>
<i>On dirait que l'explosion venait
de l'ouest, peut-être de Denver.</i>
<i>Mais si c'était une attaque,
que c'est le chaos dehors.</i>
<i>Vous ne voulez pas que les mauvaises
personnes sachent que Jericho est toujours là !</i>
<i>Oh, mon Dieu, on a quelque chose.</i>
<i>- C'était du Coréen ?
- Je pense que c'était du Chinois.
- Mandarin.</i>
<i>La question est : rapportent-ils les
faits ou sont-ils derrière tout ça ?</i>
<i>La dernière fois que l'on s'est vus,
tu allais en parler à ta femme,</i>

<i>J'aimerais tant que tu sois là quand
je me réveille le matin.</i>

que ça, si tu vois de quoi je parle.</i>
<i>Bien sûr, ça pourrait être les nerfs,
autant que la grossesse.</i>
<i>Tu n'as rien dit à Eric pour le bébé ?</i>
<i>Tous les gens qui comptaient pour moi

Nom de Dieu !
Je croyais vraiment l'avoir eue.
Tu l'auras la prochaine fois.
Retournons en patrouille.
- Il s'entraîne dur, comme tous
les autres. - S'entraîne ?
Ce n'est pas un jeu.
S'il ne tue pas une dinde avec un fusil,
comment il fera quand on lui tirera dessus ?
- Ils t'ont vraiment invité à un
exercice de tir ? - Ouais.
- Tu as dit quoi ?
- J'ai refusé poliment.
Peu importe que ce soit Thanksgiving.
J'aurais préféré une vraie dinde.
- Tu sais, si je la chasse, tu devras la nettoyer.
- Oui, un point pour toi.
Salut, vous allez bien ?
Vous vous en remettrez si on
n'a pas de dinde cette année ?
Je suis végétarienne.
C'est vrai.
- Ça en fera plus pour nous.
- Il n'y aura pas de rab.
On fera avec.
- Je suis content que tu sois là.
- Moi aussi.
Comment as-tu pu rater
tous les autres Thanksgiving ?
- Déplacement professionnel.
- Pour Thanksgiving ?
Et bien, tu sais...
le boulot de papa demandait
beaucoup de temps.
Mais c'est fini, chéri, OK ?
Merci.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Oh, tu es sûre de vouloir donner tout ça ?
Plein de gens en ont besoin plus que moi.
Certains élèves sont si maigres,
je les reconnais à peine.
- Où as-tu trouvé tout ça ?
- Au garage.
Roger était prévoyant,
comme si on avait déjà 5 enfants.
- Vous vouliez 5 enfants ?
- Il voulait 5 enfants.
J'étais d'accord pour en avoir 2,
mais pas plus.
Emily, je ne sais pas ce que je vais préparer
pour Thanksgiving cette année,
mais tu seras la bienvenue à notre table, chérie.
Merci. En général, je vais chez ma tante.
- Vous jouez toujours au football avant le repas ?
- Bien sûr.
Même l'apocalypse ne peut rien
contre certaines coutumes.
- Tu maîtrises toujours ton lancer ?
- Mieux que Jake.
- Gray fera ses élections pour finir.
- Oui, la semaine prochaine.
Le Maire est nerveux ?
Pas suffisamment.
- Tu penses que l'entraînement sera long ?
- Quelques semaines, au mieux.
Regarde-nous, pour chaque flic ou vétéran,
on a un comptable, un commercial, ou un fermier.
Fais gaffe, mon pote.
Ravenwood va revenir ?
Quand ils auront fait le tour des villes, ouais.
Reste à savoir dans combien de temps...
On a dû les effrayer.
Whoua.
Qu'est-ce que...
C'est les premiers avions
que je vois depuis les explosions.
Mais pas les derniers.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- On dirait des bombardiers.
Darcy, viens... venez tous.
Tout le monde dans la cave
jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient passés.
- Attends, je dois...
- Oui, OK. Vas-y.
Mais que se passe-t-il ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils larguent ?
Dieu seul sait.

C'est une bombe ?
Pourquoi mettre un parachute
sur une bombe ?
C'est pas con.
Hé, attends.
- Tu penses que c'est prudent ?
- Tu veux le faire ?
OK, je dis plus rien.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Je te le dirais si je savais
lire le chinois.
Hé, attendez.
Attendons de savoir ce que c'est.
Tout vient de Chine.
- A-t-on été envahi ?
- J'en doute.
S'ils voulaient nous envahir,
ils enverraient des troupes.
- Alors, c'est par charité.
- On reçoit de l'aide de Chine ?
Pourquoi pas de notre gouvernement ?
- Les Nations Unies, ou la Croix-Rouge ?
- M. le Maire...
Combien de parachutes vous avez retrouvés ?
J'en ai compté 12.
Allez chercher ceux qui possèdent
un camion pour ramener tout ça.
- On les amène où ?
- Pour l'instant, ici.
- Et trouvez-moi Éric.
- D'accord.
Il ne nous reste plus que 2 caisses de liqueur,
et 3 caisses de bière.
Et 13 bouteilles de moutarde.
Et la gnôle de l'alambic ?
La dernière production sentait le diluant
pour peinture, et pourrait rendre aveugle,
mais tout le monde en a bu, donc...
Vu qu'ils sont toujours vivants,
je pense qu'on peut rester ouverts.
Écoute, on va voir ce qu'on peut faire.
Tout va bien se passer.
Ça n'a aucun sens.
Et pourtant, je te crois.
De quoi a-t-on besoin ?
On est ensemble, et on a de la moutarde.
- Le Maire te cherche.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Tu n'as rien entendu ?
- Non, j'étais derrière.
- Oh, je vois.
- On faisait l'inventaire.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Jimmy ?
- Des avions.
Des marchandises de Chine
ont été parachutées en ville.
Je te suis.
Je dois rentrer.
Bonnie et Mimi doivent s'inquiéter.
Bon, aide-le.
- Hawkins.
- Salut.
Qu'est-ce qui est écrit ?
- Je n'en sais pas plus que toi.
- J'en doute.
Un seul d'entre nous parle chinois.
De quoi tu parles, Jake ?
La transmission satellite, tu savais
que c'était du Mandarin.
Écoute, tu peux très bien savoir
que quelqu'un parle allemand,
mais c'est pas pour ça
que tu parles allemand, OK ?
Non, c'est pas ça.
- Ce que je veux dire...
- Jake !
- Tu as bien observé ces avions ?
- Ouais. Les chasseurs étaient des Mig-19.
- Les bombardiers ressemblaient à des Antonov.
- Tu t'y connais.
Grâce à mon grand-père.
Ils étaient russes ?
Ouais, à part que les Russes ont arrêté leur
production dans les années 70.
- On laisse des avions étrangers survoler le pays ?
- C'est arrivé une seule fois.
L'Italie surveille ses frontières
depuis le 11 septembre.
- Mais c'est tout.
- Et l'Italie est un allié.
La Russie ?
La Chine ?
Je pense que les derniers contacts avec eux datent
des missiles aperçus il y a quelques semaines.
- On ne peut pas distribuer cette nourriture.
- Pardon ? Les gens ont faim, Jake.
- Je m'en fous.
- On ne peut pas parler de ça ici.
Rentrons.
- Jake, les gens ont besoin de cette nourriture.
- On en a tous besoin.
Et comment être sûr que c'est sain ?
Si les Chinois veulent nous faire du mal,
ils ont choisi un étrange moyen.
Et si c'était la seconde vague d'attaques ?
Ils attendent qu'on ait faim,
et ils empoisonnent notre nourriture.
- Qui ferait ça ?
- Un ennemi intelligent.
S'ils veulent nous envahir, plus personne
ne sera en état de se défendre.
Comme les Anglais avec les Indiens.
Ils leur ont donné des couvertures pour l'hiver,
infectées par la variole.
Je n'ai pas envie de penser à ça.
Te penses vraiment que les Chinois
veulent nous empoisonner ?
J'en sais rien, mais qui que ce soit,
ça les a pas dérangés de nous faire sauter.
Parles-en à April, on peut
peut-être tester la nourriture.
Et dans le cas contraire ?
Pendant ce temps, on dira à tout ceux qui
manipulent ces trucs de mettre des gants
et on ne les distribuera pas, tant qu'on
n'est pas sûrs que c'est sans danger.
On n'a peut-être plus ce choix.
Les amis, calmez-vous.
Hé ! Hé !
Ramène ça tout de suite !
Que tout le monde lâche ce qu'il a
et recule d'un pas !
Bill !
Baisse ce flingue maintenant !
Boucle-moi le secteur !
Ne faites pas ça, messieurs.
On est à Jericho.
Pas dans un village du Tiers-Monde.
On n'a plus d'électricité, de téléphone, de gaz.
C'est peut-être pas le Tiers-Monde,
mais on s'en approche.
On a besoin de nourriture.
- Les amis, on ne sait pas ce qui est sain ou non.
Les seules personnes qui nous voulaient du mal
sont parties par là,
et elles nous ressemblaient beaucoup !
Ça ressemble à de l'aide, et je dis "On le prend."
- Ça va ?
- Très bien ! Suis-moi.
- Tu sais qu'on n'est pas attaqués ?
- Ouais, bien sûr.
Je parle aux voisins, tu sais.
Pourquoi es-tu si contente ?
Parce qu'il y a du chocolat.
C'est pas trop mauvais,
et je suis toujours vivant.
La seule chose que ça prouve
c'est que tu es stupide.
- Quand distribueras-tu tout ça, Johnston ?
- Nous n'en débattrons pas ici.
Quoi, tu préfères aller
dans ton bureau, une fois de plus ?
Peut-être que cette fois je vais t'en mettre une.
Écoute, si tu respires toujours demain,
peut-être que nous distribuerons tout ça.
Pendant ce temps, rends-nous service
et oublie que tu veux mon boulot.
- On dirait qu'il y en a dans chaque boîte.
- Ouais.
Ça voudrait dire qu'ils vont
nous envahir ?
- J'ai pas dit ça.
- "Ne vous battez pas" ?
C'est le prix à payer
pour la nourriture.
Ce qui est sûr c'est qu'entre Gray
qui fait le malin et ces prospectus,
ça sera difficile de maintenir l'ordre.
Toutes les palettes sont là ?
Presque.
Elles sont numérotées de 1 à 12.
De 1 à 5, c'est de la nourriture
et ce truc de poisson séché.
6 et 8 : des médicaments, de l'eau.
10, 11, 12 :
des graines, des couvertures, de l'essence.
Il reste 7 et 9.
On ne les a pas retrouvées, mais on s'en occupe.
Il faut qu'on retire ça de la rue
avant qu'il n'y ait plus rien.
Ouais, t'as raison.
Mes clients ont besoin de ça.
Vous prenez tout...
Avec ces parachutes, il n'y aura
plus rien à échanger.
Tenez-vous prête.
Et moi ?
Nous avions fait un marché, Jonah.
Vous me ramenez des choses,
et je vous fais un prix.
Mais vous ne faites que prendre.
Mitchell Cafferty, ça ne vous appartient pas.
Oh, oh, doucement mon grand.
Calme-toi.
Gracie...
Mitchell et les autres
ne voient pas notre arrangement comme moi.
Si on les écoutait, ils viendraient ici
et vous briseraient le cou.
Mais je ne veux pas que ça arrive.
On y va.
Ça fait un bail, Johnston.
Ça aurait dû être plus long encore.
Gracie, toute cette nourriture dehors...
On aurait besoin d'un endroit pour la distribuer.
Par contre, il faudrait que tu arrêtes
ton trafic avec Jonah.
On a un accord.
Avait un accord...
Celui que tu viens de rompre.
Je suis des vôtres.
Ça reste ici.
Ça aussi.
Viens. Viens.
C'est bon de vous revoir, Maire Green.
En fait, ces prix que tu pratiques,
il va falloir arrêter.
Écoutez, on a juste besoin d'un endroit
pour stocker la nourriture.
- Mais comment est-ce que je...?
- Hé...
Si ça ne vous plaît pas,
il y a toujours Jonah...
Ça me va.
Bien, dans ce cas, c'est bon
de vous revoir aussi, Gracie.
Regarde.
C'est pas génial ?
Hé, hé, hé,
on ne sait pas si c'est bon.
- C'est pas du Teuscher, mais presque...
- Je veux dire, on ne sait pas si c'est sain.
Bon, si le chocolat ne te fait pas d'effet,
peut-être que ça si.
C'est un générateur.
On pourra rétablir l'électricité
et les communications.
- Écoute, prends le camion et dis-le à Jake.
- On doit partager toute cette nourriture ?
Ce n'est pas la nôtre, c'est celle de tous.
Ceux qui voulaient détruire le pont
et nous laisser pour morts ? Ceux-là ?
Premièrement, ils n'ont pas détruit le pont
et deuxièmement,
tu étais de l'autre côté à ce moment.
Prends le camion et va voir Jake.
On ne partagera pas le chocolat.
On peut mettre la nourriture
dans le magasin de Gracie.
Bien, bien.
En ce qui concerne les médicaments,
est-ce que vous pourriez, euh...?
J'irai à la clinique et les donnerai à April.
Merci.
Alors, est-ce que tu seras
avec nous pour Thanksgiving ?
Je pense que Mary et moi allons
le passer ensemble.
Tu es toujours le bienvenu.
La partie de football commence à 15 h.
Merci, mais je veux pas vous mettre
dans une situation délicate.
Tu aurais pu y penser avant
d'emménager avec ta maîtresse
en nous laissant avec ta femme.
- Je ferais mieux de retourner à Main Street.
- Merci fiston.
Ouais, on dirait qu'on va être tranquilles.
Pourquoi tu réagis comme si
c'était sans importance ?
C'est pas ça !
- J'essaie aussi de ne pas être hypocrite.
- Oh...
- Ça ne ressemble pas à notre histoire.
- Oh, vraiment ?
Je me souviens quand ma mère pensait
que ton prénom était "l'autre femme".
Et je n'en ai pas tenu rigueur,
tout comme le fait Éric.
Si c'est tellement différent,
montre-moi.
C'était différent, nous avions 20 ans.
Elle n'était pas ta femme...
... et elle n'était pas enceinte.
April est enceinte.
De quelques mois.
Eric le sait ?
April m'a fait promettre de ne pas lui dire.
Alors, euh, t'es en colère contre Eric
pour quelque chose qu'il ne sait pas ?
Ce sac de riz pourrait nourrir
toute cette foule.
Ils veulent savoir quand ils
pourront en prendre.
Aussi étrange que
ça puisse paraître, Gray,
on essaie de trouver un moyen de
tout distribuer équitablement.
Il faut que ça nous dure tout l'hiver.
Tout l'hiver ?
Ma famille a faim maintenant,
pas quand tu le décideras !
C'est peut-être nos dernières provisions.
- Ah oui ? On n'a rien eu, Jake, toi si.
- Nous aussi on a faim, Bill !
Bill, personne ici ne prend quoi que ce soit.
Si tu attendais, tu verrais qu'il y en
a assez pour tous ici.
C'est peut-être une surprise
pour vous, Greene, mais...
la plupart d'entre nous peuvent
penser d'eux-mêmes.
<i>On se croirait chez Filene's Basement* ici.
*Filene's Basement : magasins discount</i>
- Peu importe.
- Où est Stanley ?
A la ferme,
on a trouvé 2 autres parachutes.
- Un générateur était attaché à l'un d'entre eux.
- Qu'est-ce qu'on fait là ?
C'est où ?
Et ben, c'était juste ici.
Essayons par là.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Stanley.
- Hé, que s'est-il passé ?
- Jonah...
Personne ne prend d'arme
sans avoir de plan.
- Jonah aurait pu tuer Stanley.
- C'est pas le cas.
Je ne vous impliquerai pas dans une guerre
des gangs sans pouvoir vous sortir de là.
Pourquoi j'irais pas leur parler
avec Jimmy et Bill ?
Avec tout le respect que je te dois, Eric...
surtout pas.
Jonah sait qu'ils
sont en supériorité.
En lui parlant de nos intentions,
il deviendra raisonnable.
Oui, allons lui parler, ça a si
bien marché par le passé.
Si tu avais tué Jonah comme je te l'ai dit,
nous n'en serions pas là.
On a besoin du générateur,
on se croirait au Moyen-Âge.
Et plus nous attendons, plus Jonah
peut les cacher ou les échanger.
- C'est maintenant ou jamais.
- Personne ne bougera sans mon ordre.
Personne ne tirera sans mon ordre.
On est bien d'accord ?
Oui Monsieur.
Très bien, préparons-nous.
- Je prendrai Jimmy et Bill...
- Tu resteras ici, Gray.
Jonah me suffit.
J'ai pas envie qu'on
me tire dans le dos.
Peut-être que papa sera là pour
notre premier Noël ensemble.
- Il sera là, hein Maman ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
Sais-tu pourquoi je te suis reconnaissante ?
Pour toutes les excuses
que tu as dû inventer pour lui.
Le docteur a dit "Pas de commotion", donc...
Finalement, ton crâne épais
peut être utile.
- Où crois-tu aller ?
- Trouver Jonah.
Non, tu n'iras pas !
Stanley, s'il te plaît, n'y va pas.
Stanley, si quelque chose t'arrivait...
Pense à Bonnie.
- Où allez-vous ?
- Récupérer le générateur.
- Chez Jonah ?
- Oui.
- Doucement, on peut envisager autre chose.
- C'est trop tard.
Même si tu récupères le générateur,
ça ne s'arrêtera pas.
Si tu cherches mon père,
Jake, il se vengera.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Je vois Jonah.
Où sont les palettes ?
- Je ne les vois pas.
- Peut-être qu'elles ne sont plus là ?
Peut-être pas.
Elles sont sur cette remorque.
OK.
Jonah.
Johnston.
Donne-nous le générateur,
tu peux garder tout le reste.
Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles.
Laisse-moi entrer,
je te montrerai.
Désolé. Propriété privée signifie
toujours quelque chose ici.
Maintenant, si je pouvais rentrer
dans les bonnes grâces de Gracie...
la conversation serait différente.
Ouvre la porte ou
on la défonce.
Ces denrées sont à tout
le monde, pas seulement toi.
Tu n'as pas à décider pour nous.
Je pense à tout le monde, et toi ?
Qui a sauvé Jericho de ces mercenaires ?
Le générateur est à moi.
Nous sommes quittes.
Ça va mal finir pour
tout le monde, Jonah.
Préparez-vous.
<i>Il prend le générateur !</i>
<i>Il va sortir le camion !</i>
- Qui ça peut bien être ?!
- Non, ne tire pas.
- À quoi tu pensais ?
Tu aurais pu te faire tuer,
et Jonah ne m'aurait pas blessé.
Quoi ?
Et Mitchell ?
Il a failli tirer.
- Nous avons failli tirer.
- Mais c'est pas le cas, Jake.
- Au collège, tu m'aurais soutenu.
- Nous ne sommes plus des enfants.
Pourquoi ne dis-tu pas simplement :
"Bon travail" ?
- Quoi...? Non.
- Je sais que tu le penses.
- Je déposerai ça sur le chemin.
- Attends fiston.
J'y vais. Ça fait une heure
que Mary m'attend.
Elle a attendu jusqu'à maintenant,
elle peut encore attendre 5 minutes.
Prends une chaise.
Fiston, nous savons tous les
deux combien le mariage est difficile.
C'est un peu tard pour
ce sermon papa.
Bien, je passe au suivant.
La paternité est encore plus dure.
- De quoi tu parles ?
- April est enceinte.
Je viens de le découvrir.
Et c'est toi qui m'apprends ça ?
Je ne devrais pas te l'annoncer.
On m'en voudra sûrement encore longtemps
mais fallait que tu le saches.
- Je ne savais pas.
- Maintenant si.
Et tu dois faire les bons choix.
C'est fait. J'ai essayé d'améliorer
les choses avec April.
Essaie encore.
Écoute, un mauvais mariage ne se portera
pas mieux parce que tu as un enfant.
Non.
Non, c'est vrai,
mais tu vas devoir arrêter de ne
penser qu'à toi.
Tu abandonnes ce droit quand tu
mets un enfant au monde.
Fiston, April et toi avez eu la malchance
de ne plus vous aimer au même moment
mais tu peux remédier à ça.
Tu ne m'as pas écouté, papa.
Je ne pense pas avoir aimé April.
J'aime Mary.
Et je dois croire en cela.
Ma vieille amie, l'iode.
Bon, et que dois-je faire maintenant ?
Tu dois imbiber le coton d'iode,
et l'appliquer sur les plaies.
Aïe !
- Doucement s'il te plaît.
- Je suis désolée.
Je ne suis pas très douée.
Tu sais, je vais déjà mieux, donc...
Non, le docteur a dit que nous devions
soigner ces bleus deux fois par jour.
Maintenant, s'il te plaît, enlève ta chemise.
Quoi, je dois fermer les yeux ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
- Tu, euh...
- Quoi ?
Tu rougis.
C'est une réaction à l'iode.
Je pense plutôt que c'est parce que
tu as retiré ta chemise.
Arrête de te jeter des roses !
Allez, allez, j'ai pas fini.
S'il te plaît, enlève cette chemise.
Je m'attendais à beaucoup
de choses venant de toi,
mais pas que tu sois timide
face à une femme.
Si nous... si nous devons faire ça, pourrions
nous au moins parler d'autre chose ?
- Comme quoi ?
- Je ne sais pas...
Que fais-tu habituellement pour Thanksgiving ?
Je vais avec ma mère dans
une résidence à Punta Mita.
- C'est au Mexique.
- Mmm.
Pourquoi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Et bien... on regarde le foot, on mange la dinde,
on fait la sieste, comme tout le monde, quoi.
Tu oublies une chose.
Se prélasser au bord d'une piscine,
à regarder les surfeurs,
en sirotant ce que les spécialistes appellent
la meilleure margarita mangue au monde.
Ça a l'air sympa.
Pas du tout américain,
mais sympa.
En effet.
C'est bon.
Désolée que tu aies dû subir ça.
C'est quoi le plan, Jonah ?
Le jour où je devrai te répondre, Mitchell,
nous serons vraiment dans la merde.
Ce n'est pas à moi que tu dois répondre.
C'est à eux.
Hé, je trouve toujours une solution.
Mais pas aujourd'hui.
- Ils nous ont eus, une fois, ça arrive.
- Non, ils ne nous ont pas dominés.
Elle t'a dominé toi.
Tu es énervé parce que
je ne t'ai pas laissé tirer ?
- Parce que je ne t'ai pas laissé tuer ma fille ?
- Tu te ramollis, Jonah.
- Et tes erreurs nous portent préjudice.
- Ce n'était pas une erreur de sauver Emily.
Et laisser le Maire Greene
t'expulser de la ville ?
Enfin, pour l'amour de...
Tu t'es laissé donner des ordres
par Gracie Leigh ce matin.
Hé, la seule chose à retenir,
c'est que je vous sauve toujours la peau.
Tu penses pouvoir faire
mieux que moi ?
Tu veux prendre ma place ?
C'est bien ce que je pensais.
On se casse.
Tu crois qu'on doit
garder ces parachutes ?
- Ils sont dans un sale état.
- Pourquoi pas ?
Tu peux en faire des pantalons
comme ceux que tu portais au lycée.
Hé !
C'est quoi ça ?
On dirait une puce.
Ça sert à quoi ?
Aucune idée.
Mais je sais à qui demander.
C'est une puce RFID,
Identification par Radio Fréquence.
- C'est comme un code-barre, c'est ça ?
- Oui.
Avec le matériel approprié
on saurait qui les a envoyées ici.
Comment savez-vous tout ça, M. Hawkins ?
Je lis beaucoup, Eric.
Pourquoi dans
les parachutes ?
Elles sont utilisées pour faire des inventaires,
par des grandes firmes, et par une armée.
- L'armée chinoise ?
- Non, américaine.
Ces parachutes appartiennent à notre armée de l'air.
Pour clarifier...
On parle d'avions datant du Vietnam, volant sur
le Kansas, lâchant des denrées chinoises
en utilisant l'équipement
de l'armée américaine ?
On dirait.
- Dans quel monde, cela est-il possible ?
- Le nôtre.
Stanley ?
- Je suis dans la cuisine.
Tu étais censé rester couché.
- Tu sais quoi ?
- Je n'ai pas de dinde, mais, euh...
J'ai de la tequila.
Tu as aussi des mangues ?
Je n'ai jamais vu de mangues.
- Mais... j'ai du Tang.
- En poudre ?
Donc en l'honneur de ton, euh...
premier Thanksgiving à Jericho,
J'ai préparé ce que certains spécialistes
pensent être les meilleures
Margaritas au Tang.
Oh, c'est génial !
Écoute, ton père n'est pas au mieux
alors sois gentil avec lui.
- Tu plaisantes ?
- Quoi ?
Tout ça, le football,
le repas de Thanksgiving ?
- Oui, et alors ?
- Et bien, on conserve ces...
... ces traditions comme si
de rien n'était ?
Au contraire, on conserve ces traditions
à cause de ce qui est arrivé.
Oh, fiston !
Je suis content que tu aies pu venir.
Oui. Mais je ne reste pas.
Je me demandais si je pouvais parler à April.
Bien sûr...
Alors ? C'est terminé.
Oui.
Quand comptais-tu me parler du bébé ?
Quand j'aurais été sûre que ça ne
changerait pas ta décision.
Je ne voulais pas que tu restes
avec moi juste à cause du bébé.
On dirait que nous sommes
tous les deux d'accord.
Bien.
Pourquoi es-tu venu ?
Pour te dire que j'étais
désolé pour ce que j'avais fait.
Mais je ne peux plus mentir.
Et je ferai tout ce qu'il faut
pour le bien-être de ce bébé.
Pourquoi devrais-je te croire ?
Tu n'y es pas obligée.
Mais je serai là.
- Je crois que c'est bon.
- Comment savoir que ce n'est pas une bombe ?
Gray est toujours vivant,
alors on peut essayer, non ?
Merci pour votre aide, M. Hawkins.
- Désolé de vous retenir pour Thanksgiving.
- Oui.
Vous savez quoi, Bill ?
Vous pouvez attendre ?
Laissez-moi juste 10 minutes.
Pas de problème.
Merci.
Ça nous fera une assiette de moins à laver.
Tu étais au courant
pour Eric et Mary ?
Tu n'es pas obligé de répondre.
Un peu.
Tu penses que ça marchera entre eux ?
Il dit qu'elle le rend heureux.
Et quand elle ne le rendra plus heureux,
il va aussi la quitter ?
- Papa, ce n'est pas ton problème.
- Je sais, je sais, mais...
Je vous ai élevés de façon à ce que vous fassiez
les bons choix dans les moments difficiles.
- Bonsoir Emily.
- Bonsoir.
Je suis contente que tu sois là.
Tu as raté le match.
Je ne voulais pas éclipser Jake.
- Vraiment ?
- Mm-mmm.
Jake, chéri, installe Emily à côté de toi.
Merci.
Mon Dieu, j'espère qu'April
aura une fille.
Bonsoir.
Désolé.
Tu aurais dû être là il y a deux heures...
Je sais.
Je sais, mais, euh...
Attendez.
Écoutez, vous voulez bien me suivre ?
Je veux, euh... vous montrer quelque chose.
S'il te plaît, D.
Hé, Bill.
Vas-y, s'il te plaît.
Vous avez vu ça ?
Waouh !
Vous voyez...
c'est ce que papa a fait au travail aujourd'hui.
Au revoir, Gracie.

<i>Précédemment dans Jericho</i>
<i>On dirait que l'explosion venait
de l'ouest, peut-être de Denver.</i>

que c'est le chaos dehors.</i>
<i>Vous ne voulez pas que les mauvaises
personnes sachent que Jericho est toujours là !</i>
<i>Oh, mon Dieu, on a quelque chose.</i>
<i>- C'était du Coréen ?
- Je pense que c'était du Chinois.
- Mandarin.</i>
<i>La question est : rapportent-ils les
faits ou sont-ils derrière tout ça ?</i>

tu allais en parler à ta femme,</i>

<i>J'aimerais tant que tu sois là quand
je me réveille le matin.</i>
<i>La journée ne commence pas si bien
que ça, si tu vois de quoi je parle.</i>
<i>Bien sûr, ça pourrait être les nerfs,
autant que la grossesse.</i>
<i>Tu n'as rien dit à Eric pour le bébé ?</i>
<i>Tous les gens qui comptaient pour moi

<i>Salut, Jonah.</i>

<i>C'est bon, d'accord.

Nom de Dieu !
Je croyais vraiment l'avoir eue.
Tu l'auras la prochaine fois.
Retournons en patrouille.
- Il s'entraîne dur, comme tous
les autres. - S'entraîne ?
Ce n'est pas un jeu.
S'il ne tue pas une dinde avec un fusil,
comment il fera quand on lui tirera dessus ?
- Ils t'ont vraiment invité à un
exercice de tir ? - Ouais.
- Tu as dit quoi ?
- J'ai refusé poliment.
Peu importe que ce soit Thanksgiving.
J'aurais préféré une vraie dinde.
- Tu sais, si je la chasse, tu devras la nettoyer.
- Oui, un point pour toi.
Salut, vous allez bien ?
Vous vous en remettrez si on
n'a pas de dinde cette année ?
Je suis végétarienne.
C'est vrai.
- Ça en fera plus pour nous.
- Il n'y aura pas de rab.
On fera avec.
- Je suis content que tu sois là.
- Moi aussi.
Comment as-tu pu rater
tous les autres Thanksgiving ?
- Déplacement professionnel.
- Pour Thanksgiving ?
Et bien, tu sais...
le boulot de papa demandait
beaucoup de temps.
Mais c'est fini, chéri, OK ?
Merci.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Oh, tu es sûre de vouloir donner tout ça ?
Plein de gens en ont besoin plus que moi.
Certains élèves sont si maigres,
je les reconnais à peine.
- Où as-tu trouvé tout ça ?
- Au garage.
Roger était prévoyant,
comme si on avait déjà 5 enfants.
- Vous vouliez 5 enfants ?
- Il voulait 5 enfants.
J'étais d'accord pour en avoir 2,
mais pas plus.
Emily, je ne sais pas ce que je vais préparer
pour Thanksgiving cette année,
mais tu seras la bienvenue à notre table, chérie.
Merci. En général, je vais chez ma tante.
- Vous jouez toujours au football avant le repas ?
- Bien sûr.
Même l'apocalypse ne peut rien
contre certaines coutumes.
- Tu maîtrises toujours ton lancer ?
- Mieux que Jake.
- Gray fera ses élections pour finir.
- Oui, la semaine prochaine.
Le Maire est nerveux ?
Pas suffisamment.
- Tu penses que l'entraînement sera long ?
- Quelques semaines, au mieux.
Regarde-nous, pour chaque flic ou vétéran,
on a un comptable, un commercial, ou un fermier.
Fais gaffe, mon pote.
Ravenwood va revenir ?
Quand ils auront fait le tour des villes, ouais.
Reste à savoir dans combien de temps...
On a dû les effrayer.
Whoua.
Qu'est-ce que...
C'est les premiers avions
que je vois depuis les explosions.
Mais pas les derniers.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- On dirait des bombardiers.
Darcy, viens... venez tous.
Tout le monde dans la cave
jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient passés.
- Attends, je dois...
- Oui, OK. Vas-y.
Mais que se passe-t-il ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils larguent ?
Dieu seul sait.

C'est une bombe ?
Pourquoi mettre un parachute
sur une bombe ?
C'est pas con.
Hé, attends.
- Tu penses que c'est prudent ?
- Tu veux le faire ?
OK, je dis plus rien.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Je te le dirais si je savais
lire le chinois.
Hé, attendez.
Attendons de savoir ce que c'est.
Tout vient de Chine.
- A-t-on été envahi ?
- J'en doute.
S'ils voulaient nous envahir,
ils enverraient des troupes.
- Alors, c'est par charité.
- On reçoit de l'aide de Chine ?
Pourquoi pas de notre gouvernement ?
- Les Nations Unies, ou la Croix-Rouge ?
- M. le Maire...
Combien de parachutes vous avez retrouvés ?
J'en ai compté 12.
Allez chercher ceux qui possèdent
un camion pour ramener tout ça.
- On les amène où ?
- Pour l'instant, ici.
- Et trouvez-moi Éric.
- D'accord.
Il ne nous reste plus que 2 caisses de liqueur,
et 3 caisses de bière.
Et 13 bouteilles de moutarde.
Et la gnôle de l'alambic ?
La dernière production sentait le diluant
pour peinture, et pourrait rendre aveugle,
mais tout le monde en a bu, donc...
Vu qu'ils sont toujours vivants,
je pense qu'on peut rester ouverts.
Écoute, on va voir ce qu'on peut faire.
Tout va bien se passer.
Ça n'a aucun sens.
Et pourtant, je te crois.
De quoi a-t-on besoin ?
On est ensemble, et on a de la moutarde.
- Le Maire te cherche.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Tu n'as rien entendu ?
- Non, j'étais derrière.
- Oh, je vois.
- On faisait l'inventaire.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Jimmy ?
- Des avions.
Des marchandises de Chine
ont été parachutées en ville.
Je te suis.
Je dois rentrer.
Bonnie et Mimi doivent s'inquiéter.
Bon, aide-le.
- Hawkins.
- Salut.
Qu'est-ce qui est écrit ?
- Je n'en sais pas plus que toi.
- J'en doute.
Un seul d'entre nous parle chinois.
De quoi tu parles, Jake ?
La transmission satellite, tu savais
que c'était du Mandarin.
Écoute, tu peux très bien savoir
que quelqu'un parle allemand,
mais c'est pas pour ça
que tu parles allemand, OK ?
Non, c'est pas ça.
- Ce que je veux dire...
- Jake !
- Tu as bien observé ces avions ?
- Ouais. Les chasseurs étaient des Mig-19.
- Les bombardiers ressemblaient à des Antonov.
- Tu t'y connais.
Grâce à mon grand-père.
Ils étaient russes ?
Ouais, à part que les Russes ont arrêté leur
production dans les années 70.
- On laisse des avions étrangers survoler le pays ?
- C'est arrivé une seule fois.
L'Italie surveille ses frontières
depuis le 11 septembre.
- Mais c'est tout.
- Et l'Italie est un allié.
La Russie ?
La Chine ?
Je pense que les derniers contacts avec eux datent
des missiles aperçus il y a quelques semaines.
- On ne peut pas distribuer cette nourriture.
- Pardon ? Les gens ont faim, Jake.
- Je m'en fous.
- On ne peut pas parler de ça ici.
Rentrons.
- Jake, les gens ont besoin de cette nourriture.
- On en a tous besoin.
Et comment être sûr que c'est sain ?
Si les Chinois veulent nous faire du mal,
ils ont choisi un étrange moyen.
Et si c'était la seconde vague d'attaques ?
Ils attendent qu'on ait faim,
et ils empoisonnent notre nourriture.
- Qui ferait ça ?
- Un ennemi intelligent.
S'ils veulent nous envahir, plus personne
ne sera en état de se défendre.
Comme les Anglais avec les Indiens.
Ils leur ont donné des couvertures pour l'hiver,
infectées par la variole.
Je n'ai pas envie de penser à ça.
Te penses vraiment que les Chinois
veulent nous empoisonner ?
J'en sais rien, mais qui que ce soit,
ça les a pas dérangés de nous faire sauter.
Parles-en à April, on peut
peut-être tester la nourriture.
Et dans le cas contraire ?
Pendant ce temps, on dira à tout ceux qui
manipulent ces trucs de mettre des gants
et on ne les distribuera pas, tant qu'on
n'est pas sûrs que c'est sans danger.
On n'a peut-être plus ce choix.
Les amis, calmez-vous.
Hé ! Hé !
Ramène ça tout de suite !
Que tout le monde lâche ce qu'il a
et recule d'un pas !
Bill !
Baisse ce flingue maintenant !
Boucle-moi le secteur !
Ne faites pas ça, messieurs.
On est à Jericho.
Pas dans un village du Tiers-Monde.
On n'a plus d'électricité, de téléphone, de gaz.
C'est peut-être pas le Tiers-Monde,
mais on s'en approche.
On a besoin de nourriture.
- Les amis, on ne sait pas ce qui est sain ou non.
Les seules personnes qui nous voulaient du mal
sont parties par là,
et elles nous ressemblaient beaucoup !
Ça ressemble à de l'aide, et je dis "On le prend."
- Ça va ?
- Très bien ! Suis-moi.
- Tu sais qu'on n'est pas attaqués ?
- Ouais, bien sûr.
Je parle aux voisins, tu sais.
Pourquoi es-tu si contente ?
Parce qu'il y a du chocolat.
C'est pas trop mauvais,
et je suis toujours vivant.
La seule chose que ça prouve
c'est que tu es stupide.
- Quand distribueras-tu tout ça, Johnston ?
- Nous n'en débattrons pas ici.
Quoi, tu préfères aller
dans ton bureau, une fois de plus ?
Peut-être que cette fois je vais t'en mettre une.
Écoute, si tu respires toujours demain,
peut-être que nous distribuerons tout ça.
Pendant ce temps, rends-nous service
et oublie que tu veux mon boulot.
- On dirait qu'il y en a dans chaque boîte.
- Ouais.
Ça voudrait dire qu'ils vont
nous envahir ?
- J'ai pas dit ça.
- "Ne vous battez pas" ?
C'est le prix à payer
pour la nourriture.
Ce qui est sûr c'est qu'entre Gray
qui fait le malin et ces prospectus,
ça sera difficile de maintenir l'ordre.
Toutes les palettes sont là ?
Presque.
Elles sont numérotées de 1 à 12.
De 1 à 5, c'est de la nourriture
et ce truc de poisson séché.
6 et 8 : des médicaments, de l'eau.
10, 11, 12 :
des graines, des couvertures, de l'essence.
Il reste 7 et 9.
On ne les a pas retrouvées, mais on s'en occupe.
Il faut qu'on retire ça de la rue
avant qu'il n'y ait plus rien.
Ouais, t'as raison.
Mes clients ont besoin de ça.
Vous prenez tout...
Avec ces parachutes, il n'y aura
plus rien à échanger.
Tenez-vous prête.
Et moi ?
Nous avions fait un marché, Jonah.
Vous me ramenez des choses,
et je vous fais un prix.
Mais vous ne faites que prendre.
Mitchell Cafferty, ça ne vous appartient pas.
Oh, oh, doucement mon grand.
Calme-toi.
Gracie...
Mitchell et les autres
ne voient pas notre arrangement comme moi.
Si on les écoutait, ils viendraient ici
et vous briseraient le cou.
Mais je ne veux pas que ça arrive.
On y va.
Ça fait un bail, Johnston.
Ça aurait dû être plus long encore.
Gracie, toute cette nourriture dehors...
On aurait besoin d'un endroit pour la distribuer.
Par contre, il faudrait que tu arrêtes
ton trafic avec Jonah.
On a un accord.
Avait un accord...
Celui que tu viens de rompre.
Je suis des vôtres.
Ça reste ici.
Ça aussi.
Viens. Viens.
C'est bon de vous revoir, Maire Green.
En fait, ces prix que tu pratiques,
il va falloir arrêter.
Écoutez, on a juste besoin d'un endroit
pour stocker la nourriture.
- Mais comment est-ce que je...?
- Hé...
Si ça ne vous plaît pas,
il y a toujours Jonah...
Ça me va.
Bien, dans ce cas, c'est bon
de vous revoir aussi, Gracie.
Regarde.
C'est pas génial ?
Hé, hé, hé,
on ne sait pas si c'est bon.
- C'est pas du Teuscher, mais presque...
- Je veux dire, on ne sait pas si c'est sain.
Bon, si le chocolat ne te fait pas d'effet,
peut-être que ça si.
C'est un générateur.
On pourra rétablir l'électricité
et les communications.
- Écoute, prends le camion et dis-le à Jake.
- On doit partager toute cette nourriture ?
Ce n'est pas la nôtre, c'est celle de tous.
Ceux qui voulaient détruire le pont
et nous laisser pour morts ? Ceux-là ?
Premièrement, ils n'ont pas détruit le pont
et deuxièmement,
tu étais de l'autre côté à ce moment.
Prends le camion et va voir Jake.
On ne partagera pas le chocolat.
On peut mettre la nourriture
dans le magasin de Gracie.
Bien, bien.
En ce qui concerne les médicaments,
est-ce que vous pourriez, euh...?
J'irai à la clinique et les donnerai à April.
Merci.
Alors, est-ce que tu seras
avec nous pour Thanksgiving ?
Je pense que Mary et moi allons
le passer ensemble.
Tu es toujours le bienvenu.
La partie de football commence à 15 h.
Merci, mais je veux pas vous mettre
dans une situation délicate.
Tu aurais pu y penser avant
d'emménager avec ta maîtresse
en nous laissant avec ta femme.
- Je ferais mieux de retourner à Main Street.
- Merci fiston.
Ouais, on dirait qu'on va être tranquilles.
Pourquoi tu réagis comme si
c'était sans importance ?
C'est pas ça !
- J'essaie aussi de ne pas être hypocrite.
- Oh...
- Ça ne ressemble pas à notre histoire.
- Oh, vraiment ?
Je me souviens quand ma mère pensait
que ton prénom était "l'autre femme".
Et je n'en ai pas tenu rigueur,
tout comme le fait Éric.
Si c'est tellement différent,
montre-moi.
C'était différent, nous avions 20 ans.
Elle n'était pas ta femme...
... et elle n'était pas enceinte.
April est enceinte.
De quelques mois.
Eric le sait ?
April m'a fait promettre de ne pas lui dire.
Alors, euh, t'es en colère contre Eric
pour quelque chose qu'il ne sait pas ?
Ce sac de riz pourrait nourrir
toute cette foule.
Ils veulent savoir quand ils
pourront en prendre.
Aussi étrange que
ça puisse paraître, Gray,
on essaie de trouver un moyen de
tout distribuer équitablement.
Il faut que ça nous dure tout l'hiver.
Tout l'hiver ?
Ma famille a faim maintenant,
pas quand tu le décideras !
C'est peut-être nos dernières provisions.
- Ah oui ? On n'a rien eu, Jake, toi si.
- Nous aussi on a faim, Bill !
Bill, personne ici ne prend quoi que ce soit.
Si tu attendais, tu verrais qu'il y en
a assez pour tous ici.
C'est peut-être une surprise
pour vous, Greene, mais...
la plupart d'entre nous peuvent
penser d'eux-mêmes.
<i>On se croirait chez Filene's Basement* ici.
*Filene's Basement : magasins discount</i>
- Peu importe.
- Où est Stanley ?
A la ferme,
on a trouvé 2 autres parachutes.
- Un générateur était attaché à l'un d'entre eux.
- Qu'est-ce qu'on fait là ?
C'est où ?
Et ben, c'était juste ici.
Essayons par là.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Stanley.
- Hé, que s'est-il passé ?
- Jonah...
Personne ne prend d'arme
sans avoir de plan.
- Jonah aurait pu tuer Stanley.
- C'est pas le cas.
Je ne vous impliquerai pas dans une guerre
des gangs sans pouvoir vous sortir de là.
Pourquoi j'irais pas leur parler
avec Jimmy et Bill ?
Avec tout le respect que je te dois, Eric...
surtout pas.
Jonah sait qu'ils
sont en supériorité.
En lui parlant de nos intentions,
il deviendra raisonnable.
Oui, allons lui parler, ça a si
bien marché par le passé.
Si tu avais tué Jonah comme je te l'ai dit,
nous n'en serions pas là.
On a besoin du générateur,
on se croirait au Moyen-Âge.
Et plus nous attendons, plus Jonah
peut les cacher ou les échanger.
- C'est maintenant ou jamais.
- Personne ne bougera sans mon ordre.
Personne ne tirera sans mon ordre.
On est bien d'accord ?
Oui Monsieur.
Très bien, préparons-nous.
- Je prendrai Jimmy et Bill...
- Tu resteras ici, Gray.
Jonah me suffit.
J'ai pas envie qu'on
me tire dans le dos.
Peut-être que papa sera là pour
notre premier Noël ensemble.
- Il sera là, hein Maman ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
Sais-tu pourquoi je te suis reconnaissante ?
Pour toutes les excuses
que tu as dû inventer pour lui.
Le docteur a dit "Pas de commotion", donc...
Finalement, ton crâne épais
peut être utile.
- Où crois-tu aller ?
- Trouver Jonah.
Non, tu n'iras pas !
Stanley, s'il te plaît, n'y va pas.
Stanley, si quelque chose t'arrivait...
Pense à Bonnie.
- Où allez-vous ?
- Récupérer le générateur.
- Chez Jonah ?
- Oui.
- Doucement, on peut envisager autre chose.
- C'est trop tard.
Même si tu récupères le générateur,
ça ne s'arrêtera pas.
Si tu cherches mon père,
Jake, il se vengera.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Je vois Jonah.
Où sont les palettes ?
- Je ne les vois pas.
- Peut-être qu'elles ne sont plus là ?
Peut-être pas.
Elles sont sur cette remorque.
OK.
Jonah.
Johnston.
Donne-nous le générateur,
tu peux garder tout le reste.
Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles.
Laisse-moi entrer,
je te montrerai.
Désolé. Propriété privée signifie
toujours quelque chose ici.
Maintenant, si je pouvais rentrer
dans les bonnes grâces de Gracie...
la conversation serait différente.
Ouvre la porte ou
on la défonce.
Ces denrées sont à tout
le monde, pas seulement toi.
Tu n'as pas à décider pour nous.
Je pense à tout le monde, et toi ?
Qui a sauvé Jericho de ces mercenaires ?
Le générateur est à moi.
Nous sommes quittes.
Ça va mal finir pour
tout le monde, Jonah.
Préparez-vous.
<i>Il prend le générateur !</i>
<i>Il va sortir le camion !</i>
- Qui ça peut bien être ?!
- Non, ne tire pas.
- À quoi tu pensais ?
Tu aurais pu te faire tuer,
et Jonah ne m'aurait pas blessé.
Quoi ?
Et Mitchell ?
Il a failli tirer.
- Nous avons failli tirer.
- Mais c'est pas le cas, Jake.
- Au collège, tu m'aurais soutenu.
- Nous ne sommes plus des enfants.
Pourquoi ne dis-tu pas simplement :
"Bon travail" ?
- Quoi...? Non.
- Je sais que tu le penses.
- Je déposerai ça sur le chemin.
- Attends fiston.
J'y vais. Ça fait une heure
que Mary m'attend.
Elle a attendu jusqu'à maintenant,
elle peut encore attendre 5 minutes.
Prends une chaise.
Fiston, nous savons tous les
deux combien le mariage est difficile.
C'est un peu tard pour
ce sermon papa.
Bien, je passe au suivant.
La paternité est encore plus dure.
- De quoi tu parles ?
- April est enceinte.
Je viens de le découvrir.
Et c'est toi qui m'apprends ça ?
Je ne devrais pas te l'annoncer.
On m'en voudra sûrement encore longtemps
mais fallait que tu le saches.
- Je ne savais pas.
- Maintenant si.
Et tu dois faire les bons choix.
C'est fait. J'ai essayé d'améliorer
les choses avec April.
Essaie encore.
Écoute, un mauvais mariage ne se portera
pas mieux parce que tu as un enfant.
Non.
Non, c'est vrai,
mais tu vas devoir arrêter de ne
penser qu'à toi.
Tu abandonnes ce droit quand tu
mets un enfant au monde.
Fiston, April et toi avez eu la malchance
de ne plus vous aimer au même moment
mais tu peux remédier à ça.
Tu ne m'as pas écouté, papa.
Je ne pense pas avoir aimé April.
J'aime Mary.
Et je dois croire en cela.
Ma vieille amie, l'iode.
Bon, et que dois-je faire maintenant ?
Tu dois imbiber le coton d'iode,
et l'appliquer sur les plaies.
Aïe !
- Doucement s'il te plaît.
- Je suis désolée.
Je ne suis pas très douée.
Tu sais, je vais déjà mieux, donc...
Non, le docteur a dit que nous devions
soigner ces bleus deux fois par jour.
Maintenant, s'il te plaît, enlève ta chemise.
Quoi, je dois fermer les yeux ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
- Tu, euh...
- Quoi ?
Tu rougis.
C'est une réaction à l'iode.
Je pense plutôt que c'est parce que
tu as retiré ta chemise.
Arrête de te jeter des roses !
Allez, allez, j'ai pas fini.
S'il te plaît, enlève cette chemise.
Je m'attendais à beaucoup
de choses venant de toi,
mais pas que tu sois timide
face à une femme.
Si nous... si nous devons faire ça, pourrions
nous au moins parler d'autre chose ?
- Comme quoi ?
- Je ne sais pas...
Que fais-tu habituellement pour Thanksgiving ?
Je vais avec ma mère dans
une résidence à Punta Mita.
- C'est au Mexique.
- Mmm.
Pourquoi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Et bien... on regarde le foot, on mange la dinde,
on fait la sieste, comme tout le monde, quoi.
Tu oublies une chose.
Se prélasser au bord d'une piscine,
à regarder les surfeurs,
en sirotant ce que les spécialistes appellent
la meilleure margarita mangue au monde.
Ça a l'air sympa.
Pas du tout américain,
mais sympa.
En effet.
C'est bon.
Désolée que tu aies dû subir ça.
C'est quoi le plan, Jonah ?
Le jour où je devrai te répondre, Mitchell,
nous serons vraiment dans la merde.
Ce n'est pas à moi que tu dois répondre.
C'est à eux.
Hé, je trouve toujours une solution.
Mais pas aujourd'hui.
- Ils nous ont eus, une fois, ça arrive.
- Non, ils ne nous ont pas dominés.
Elle t'a dominé toi.
Tu es énervé parce que
je ne t'ai pas laissé tirer ?
- Parce que je ne t'ai pas laissé tuer ma fille ?
- Tu te ramollis, Jonah.
- Et tes erreurs nous portent préjudice.
- Ce n'était pas une erreur de sauver Emily.
Et laisser le Maire Greene
t'expulser de la ville ?
Enfin, pour l'amour de...
Tu t'es laissé donner des ordres
par Gracie Leigh ce matin.
Hé, la seule chose à retenir,
c'est que je vous sauve toujours la peau.
Tu penses pouvoir faire
mieux que moi ?
Tu veux prendre ma place ?
C'est bien ce que je pensais.
On se casse.
Tu crois qu'on doit
garder ces parachutes ?
- Ils sont dans un sale état.
- Pourquoi pas ?
Tu peux en faire des pantalons
comme ceux que tu portais au lycée.
Hé !
C'est quoi ça ?
On dirait une puce.
Ça sert à quoi ?
Aucune idée.
Mais je sais à qui demander.
C'est une puce RFID,
Identification par Radio Fréquence.
- C'est comme un code-barre, c'est ça ?
- Oui.
Avec le matériel approprié
on saurait qui les a envoyées ici.
Comment savez-vous tout ça, M. Hawkins ?
Je lis beaucoup, Eric.
Pourquoi dans
les parachutes ?
Elles sont utilisées pour faire des inventaires,
par des grandes firmes, et par une armée.
- L'armée chinoise ?
- Non, américaine.
Ces parachutes appartiennent à notre armée de l'air.
Pour clarifier...
On parle d'avions datant du Vietnam, volant sur
le Kansas, lâchant des denrées chinoises
en utilisant l'équipement
de l'armée américaine ?
On dirait.
- Dans quel monde, cela est-il possible ?
- Le nôtre.
Stanley ?
- Je suis dans la cuisine.
Tu étais censé rester couché.
- Tu sais quoi ?
- Je n'ai pas de dinde, mais, euh...
J'ai de la tequila.
Tu as aussi des mangues ?
Je n'ai jamais vu de mangues.
- Mais... j'ai du Tang.
- En poudre ?
Donc en l'honneur de ton, euh...
premier Thanksgiving à Jericho,
J'ai préparé ce que certains spécialistes
pensent être les meilleures
Margaritas au Tang.
Oh, c'est génial !
Écoute, ton père n'est pas au mieux
alors sois gentil avec lui.
- Tu plaisantes ?
- Quoi ?
Tout ça, le football,
le repas de Thanksgiving ?
- Oui, et alors ?
- Et bien, on conserve ces...
... ces traditions comme si
de rien n'était ?
Au contraire, on conserve ces traditions
à cause de ce qui est arrivé.
Oh, fiston !
Je suis content que tu aies pu venir.
Oui. Mais je ne reste pas.
Je me demandais si je pouvais parler à April.
Bien sûr...
Alors ? C'est terminé.
Oui.
Quand comptais-tu me parler du bébé ?
Quand j'aurais été sûre que ça ne
changerait pas ta décision.
Je ne voulais pas que tu restes
avec moi juste à cause du bébé.
On dirait que nous sommes
tous les deux d'accord.
Bien.
Pourquoi es-tu venu ?
Pour te dire que j'étais
désolé pour ce que j'avais fait.
Mais je ne peux plus mentir.
Et je ferai tout ce qu'il faut
pour le bien-être de ce bébé.
Pourquoi devrais-je te croire ?
Tu n'y es pas obligée.
Mais je serai là.
- Je crois que c'est bon.
- Comment savoir que ce n'est pas une bombe ?
Gray est toujours vivant,
alors on peut essayer, non ?
Merci pour votre aide, M. Hawkins.
- Désolé de vous retenir pour Thanksgiving.
- Oui.
Vous savez quoi, Bill ?
Vous pouvez attendre ?
Laissez-moi juste 10 minutes.
Pas de problème.
Merci.
Ça nous fera une assiette de moins à laver.
Tu étais au courant
pour Eric et Mary ?
Tu n'es pas obligé de répondre.
Un peu.
Tu penses que ça marchera entre eux ?
Il dit qu'elle le rend heureux.
Et quand elle ne le rendra plus heureux,
il va aussi la quitter ?
- Papa, ce n'est pas ton problème.
- Je sais, je sais, mais...
Je vous ai élevés de façon à ce que vous fassiez
les bons choix dans les moments difficiles.
- Bonsoir Emily.
- Bonsoir.
Je suis contente que tu sois là.
Tu as raté le match.
Je ne voulais pas éclipser Jake.
- Vraiment ?
- Mm-mmm.
Jake, chéri, installe Emily à côté de toi.
Merci.
Mon Dieu, j'espère qu'April
aura une fille.
Bonsoir.
Désolé.
Tu aurais dû être là il y a deux heures...
Je sais.
Je sais, mais, euh...
Attendez.
Écoutez, vous voulez bien me suivre ?
Je veux, euh... vous montrer quelque chose.
S'il te plaît, D.
Hé, Bill.
Vas-y, s'il te plaît.
Vous avez vu ça ?
Waouh !
Vous voyez...
c'est ce que papa a fait au travail aujourd'hui.
Au revoir, Gracie.

Previously on Jericho:
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west, maybe Denver.
If it was an attack,
and there is chaos out there,
you might not want the wrong people
knowing that Jericho is still here.
Oh, my God, we got something.
- Was that Korean?
- I think it was Chinese.
- Mandarin.
Question is: Were they just
reporting it or are they behind it?
The last time I saw you,
you were going to tell your wife about us
and we were going to
start our life together.
I wake up in the morning and I
want it to be you there so badly.
It hasn't been a particularly good morning,
if you know what I mean?
Of course, it could be the nerves
as much as the pregnancy.
You didn't tell Eric about the baby?
Everyone that I ever cared about
was incinerated four weeks ago.
And you're gonna tell me
that you know how I feel?
- I'm trying to be nice to you.
- Well stop being nice to me!
Hello, Jonah.
The guy did four years at Lansing
for extortion and assault,
and you want to negotiate with that guy?
I've seen what happens when people lose
their hold on law and order--
you start striking bargains with the
bad guys, it's the beginning of the end.
Why are you talking to him?
It's okay, all right? It didn't
have anything to do with you.
He's my father--
it has everything to do with me.
We need a security force.
A real one, trained.
Sanctioned, by you.
Make sure you do it right.
Darn it!
I really thought I had that one.
Well, we'll get 'em next time.
Let's get back on patrol.
- He's trying hard.
They all are.
- Trying?
This isn't a drill.
If he can't hit a turkey with
a shotgun, what happens
when his target shoots back?
- They really invited you on a turkey shoot?
- Mmmm.
- What'd you say?
- I declined politely.
I don't care if it is Thanksgiving.
Be nice to have a real turkey.
- Well, you know, if I shot it,
you would have to clean it.
- Yeah, good point.
Hey, what about you guys?
You gonna be crushed not
to have a turkey this year?
I'm a vegetarian.
Right.
- Well, we'll have plenty for you.
- There's not "plenty" of anything.
We'll make do.
- I'm just glad you're gonna be here.
- Hey, me, too.
How come you missed all
the other Thanksgivings?
- Was business trips.
- On Thanksgiving?
Well, you know...
it wasn't a big holiday
where Daddy was working.
Those days are over, son, okay?
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Oh, you sure you want to donate all at?
A lot of folks need it more than I do.
Some of my students are so skinny
I barely recognize them.
- Where'd you find it?
- The garage.
Roger was such a planner,
you'd think we already had five kids.
- You want to have five kids?
- He wanted five kids.
I said I was good for two,
and after that he was on his own.
Emily, I don't quite know what I'm
serving for Thanksgiving this year
but always know that you're
welcome at our table, honey.
Thanks, I usually go to my aunt's.
- Do you guys still have that football
game before dinner?
- Of course.
There are some things the
apocalypse can't change.
- How's your throwing arm?
- Still better than Jake's.
- Oh, Gray's finally getting that
election, huh? - Yeah, next week.
Is the mayor nervous?
Not as nervous as he should be.
- How long do think it'll take us to
train our guys? - Oh, weeks at best.
Look at us-- for every cop and veteran,
we've got an accountant or travel agent,
or a farmer.
Watch it, buddy.
Think Ravenwood will be back?
When they run out of towns, yeah.
Questions is, how long...
Must have scared them off.
Whoa.
What the...?
Those are the first planes
I've seen since the bombs.
But not the last.
- What is that?
- It sounds like bombers.
Darcy, come on. Everybody.
I want everybody into the
basement until they pass.
- And, hey. Listen, I have got to...
- Okay, go. Go.
What the hell's going on?
What are they dropping?
God only knows.
You think it's a bomb?
Why would someone put
a parachute on a bomb?
Good point.
Whoa, whoa.
- You think that's safe?
- You want to do it?
Okay, I'll shut up.
What is that?
I'd tell you if I knew Chinese.
Whoa, folks, hold up.
Let's just wait until we
know what we got here.
It's all from China.
- Are we being invaded?
- I doubt it.
If they wanted to invade,
they'd have sent troops.
- So this is charity.
- We're getting aid from China?
Why isn't our own government helping us?
- The United Nations or the Red Cross?
- Mayor...
Oh, hey, guys. How many chutes
did you say were out there?
Well, I counted 12.
Well, let's get everybody with a working
vehicle out there and round this stuff up.
- Bring them where?
- Well, for now, here.
- And somebody find Eric for me.
- All right.
- Okay.
So... we're down to a few cases
of liquor and three cases of near beer.
And 13 bottles of mustard.
What about booze from the still?
Well, the last batch tasted like paint
thinner and may cause blindness
but everybody drank it, so...
I guess if they're not all
dead, then we can stay open.
Look, we'll figure it out.
Everything's gonna be fine.
That makes no sense at all.
And yet I totally, completely believe you.
What else do we need?
We got each other and mustard.
- Mayor's looking for you.
- What's up?
- Didn't you hear?
- No, I was in the back.
- Oh, right.
- Doing inventory.
- What is it, Jimmy?
- Uh, planes.
- There are parachutes from China
all over town. - I'm right behind you.
I got to get back.
Bonnie and Mimi must be freaking out.
All right, give him a hand.
- Hawkins.
- Hey.
What does it say?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- I doubt that.
Only one of us speaks Chinese.
What are you talking about, Jake?
The broadcast, when it came over the
satellite, you knew it was Mandarin.
Hey, you know, you can know when
somebody's talking German
but that doesn't mean you
can speak German, right?
That's not what I meant at all.
- What I'm saying is...
- Jake!
- You get a good look at those planes?
- Yeah. The jets were mig 19s.
- he bombers, they looked like Antonovs.
- You know your planes.
My grandfather made sure of that.
- So they were Russian?
- Yeah, except the Russians
stopped making them in the '70s.
- Since when do we let foreign jets
fly through our airspace?
- Happened only once.
Italy patrolled the border after 9-11.
- But that was it.
- And Italy is an ally.
Russia? China?
I imagine the last contact we had
with them were those missiles
we saw flying a few weeks back.
We can't give out this food.
- What are you talking about?
- The people are hungry, Jake.
- I don't care.
- We can't have this conversation here.
- Inside.
- Jake, the people need that food.
- We all could use the food.
How do we know it's safe?
- Well, if the Chinese are trying to
hurt us, they sure picked a funny
way to do it. - What if, what if this
is the second wave of the attacks?
They wait until we're hungry,
and then they poison our food supply.
- Who would do that?
- A smart enemy.
If they were to invade, we'd have no one
healthy enough to fight them.
It's like the British did to the Indians.
- Gave them blankets for the winter,
but didn't mention they were
infected with smallpox. - I don't
even want to think about this.
Do you really think the Chinese
are trying to poison us?
I don't know, but whoever it was,
they had no problem blowing us up.
Check with April-- maybe there's
a way we can test the food.
Well, what if there isn't?
In the meantime, we tell everybody who's
handling this stuff to put gloves on first
and we don't hand out to anybody
until we're sure it's safe.
We may not have that choice.
Folks, let's calm down.
Hey! Hey!
Back it up right now!
- Everybody, drop what you have
and take a step back!
- Bill!
Put that damn gun away now!
Get this area cordoned off!
Don't do this, people.
This is Jericho.
This is not some third-world village.
We got no power, no phones, no gas.
We may not be the third world,
but we're getting there.
We need food now.
- Folks, we don't know what is safe
and what is not safe. - The only
people I've seen trying to hurt
us have been out on that road
and they look a lot like you and me.
This looks like help, and I say we take it.
- Are you okay?
- I am great! Come on.
- So you know we're not being attacked?
- Yeah, of course.
I do talk to the neighbors, you know.
Why are you so happy?
Because we have chocolate.
That stuff wasn't half bad,
and I'm still alive.
The only thing that proved
is that you're clinically stupid.
- When are you going to hand out
that food, Johnston?
- We are not having that debate here.
What, should we have
it in your office again?
Maybe this time I sucker punch you.
Listen, if you're still breathing this time
tomorrow, maybe we'll distribute this stuff.
In the meantime, do the town a favor and
forget you want my job for one second.
- Seemed to be in every box.
- Yeah.
Could this mean we're
gonna be conquered?
- It doesn't say that.
- "Do not fight"?
It could be the price we pay for free food.
- That's it. - All I know is that between
the stunt Gray's pulling and these flyers,
we could have a problem keeping order.
Is this all of the pallets?
Almost.
They're numbered one through 12.
One through five is food
and this dried fish stuff.
Six and eight:
we got medical supplies, water.
Ten, 11, 12: grain, blankets, and fuel.
That leaves seven and nine.
They're still missing,
but we got people looking for them.
- We need to get this stuff off the street
before there's nothing left to protect.
- Yeah, you're right.
My customers need that.
You are taking everything.
With those air drops, there's no telling
what's out there to trade.
We got to be ready.
Well, what about me?
We had a deal, Jonah.
You'd bring me things,
and I give you a cut.
Now you just take.
Mitchell Cafferty, that is not yours.
Whoa, whoa, easy, big fella.
Take it easy.
Gracie...
Mitchell and the other guys
don't see our arrangement the way I do.
If it were up to them, they'd just come
in here and snap your neck.
But I don't want to see that happen.
Let's go.
Long time, no see, Johnston.
It was supposed to be longer.
Gracie, we got all this food out here.
We sure could use a place to distribute it.
Only thing is, you'd have to stop
doing business with Jonah.
We have a deal.
Had a deal... the one you broke.
I'm in.
That stays.
And this.
Come on. Come on.
It's good to have you back, Mayor Green.
Well, those prices you've been charging,
those are going to have to stop.
Hey, look,
we just need a place to store the food.
- Well, how am I going to make...? - Hey,
if you don't like it, there's always Jonah.
I like it.
Well, in that case, it's good to
have you back, too, Gracie.
Look.
Isn't it great?
Hey, hey, hey,
you don't know if that's okay.
- Well, it's not Teuscher, but in a pinch...
- I mean, you don't know if it's safe.
Well, if the chocolate didn't impress you,
maybe this will.
- It's a generator. - So we can get
power back and communications.
- Listen, take my truck and go tell Jake.
- But do we have to give up all the food?
It's not our food; it's the town's food.
You mean, the town that was going to
blow that bridge and leave us for dead?
That town?
A: They didn't blow up the bridge,
and B: you were on the
other side of it at the time.
Take the truck and go tell Jake.
We're not sharing the chocolate.
- And we can fit all the food into
Gracie's store. - Good, good.
Regarding the medical supplies,
would you guys mind, um...?
I'll go to the clinic and give them to April.
Thank you.
So, are we going to see
you for Thanksgiving?
I think Mary and I are
going to spend it together.
Well, you're always welcome.
Football starts at 3:00.
Thanks, but I don't want to put you guys
in an awkward position.
You could have thought of that
before you moved in with your
mistress and left your wife with us.
- I'd better get back to Main Street.
- Thanks, son.
Yeah, now it feels like the holidays.
- Why do you keep acting
like it's no big deal? - I don't.
- I'm also trying not to act like a hypocrite.
- Oh...
- This is nothing like what
we went through. - Oh, no?
I seem to recall when my mother thought
your name was "the other woman."
And I ignored her just the way
Eric's ignoring us.
Now, if this is so different,
I'm not seeing it.
It is different, because we were
barely in our 20s
she wasn't your wife...
...and she wasn't pregnant.
April's pregnant.
She's a few months along.
Does Eric know?
April made me promise not to tell him.
So, then, um, you're mad at Eric over
something he doesn't even know about?
That bag of rice could
feed this whole crowd.
They'd like to know when
they're gonna see some of it.
Well, odd as it might seem to you, Gray,
we're trying come up with a plan
to distribute this stuff fairly.
It might have to last
us through the winter.
Through the winter?
- My family's hungry now, not when you
decide it's okay for them to be hungry.
- This might be the last food we get.
- Yeah? Well, we're not getting it, Jake,
you are. - Look, we're hungry, too, Bill!
Bill, nobody here is taking anything.
If you'll just wait, you'll find there's
plenty of this to go around.
It may come as a surprise to
some of you Greens, but many
of us can think for ourselves.
It is like Filene's Basement out here.
- Oh, never mind.
- Where's Stanley?
- He's back at the farm.
- We found two more parachutes.
One of them has a generator.
What are we doing here?
Where is it?
Well, it was right here.
Let's try this way.
Oh, my God.
Stanley.
- Hey, what happened?
- Jonah...
Nobody grabs a gun until we have a plan.
- Jonah could have killed Stanley.
- But he didn't.
And I'm not getting us into a firefight
unless I can get us out--
all of us.
Look, why don't I go down there with
Jimmy and Bill and talk to them.
Uh, all due respect, Eric...
hell no.
Look, Jonah knows he's outnumbered.
If we let him know our intent,
he will listen to reason.
Yeah, let's talk to him, 'cause that's
worked out so well in the past.
- If you'd shut Jonah down when I told
you to, we wouldn't be having this
conversation. - We need that generator.
Without it we're stuck in the 1800s,
and the longer we wait, the longer
Jonah has to hide it or to trade it off.
- It's now or not at all. - Nobody moves
on the compound unless I say so.
Nobody shoots unless I say so.
Are we clear?
Yes, sir.
All right then, let's load up.
- I'll take Jimmy and Bill...
- You sit this one out, Gray.
I have Jonah to worry about.
I don't need somebody
shooting me in the back.
Maybe Dad will be home in time
for our first Christmas together.
- He'll be here.
Won't he, Mom?
- Yes, he will.
You know what I'm most thankful for?
Being reminded of how many
excuses you always made for him.
Doctor said no concussion, so...
That thick skull of yours
finally came in handy.
- Where do you think you're going?
- After Jonah.
- No, you aren't.
Stanley, please don't go.
Stanley, if anything happened to you...
Think of Bonnie.
- Where you going?
- To get the generator.
- From Jonah?
- Yeah.
- Slow down-- we can think
of a better way. - It's too late.
Even if you get the generator, it
won't end there.
If you push my father,
Jake, he'll push back.
What do you want me to do?
I've got Jonah.
What about those pallets?
- I don't see them.
- Maybe they're gone already.
Maybe not.
They're on that flatbed.
Okay.
Jonah.
Johnston.
Give us the generator,
you can keep everything else.
I've got no idea what you're talking about.
Let's take a look around,
I'll show you.
Sorry. Private property still
means something out here.
Now, if I still had a way of making a living
at Gracie's market...
this might be a different conversation.
Open the gate or we're coming through.
Those supplies dropped for everyone,
not just you.
You don't get to decide for the rest of us.
I'm looking out for the whole town,
what about you?
Who the hell do you think saved
Jericho from those mercenaries?
I'm hanging on to the genny.
We'll call it even.
This doesn't end well
for either of us, Jonah.
Let's get ready.
He's taking the genny!
He's taking the truck out!
- Who the hell...?
- Hold it, don't shoot.
What the hell were you thinking?
That you could have gotten killed,
and Jonah wouldn't have hurt me.
What?
- What about Mitchell?
- He almost shot you.
- Hell, we almost shot you.
- But you didn't, Jake.
- God, when we were in high school you
would have been right there with me.
- We're not kids anymore.
Why don't you just say, "good job"?
- What...? No.
- I know it's what you're thinking.
- I'll put these back on my way out.
- Wait up, son.
I got to go--
I told Mary I'd be back an hour ago.
Well, she's waited this long,
she can wait five more minutes.
Grab a chair.
Now, son,
we both know that marriage is hard.
It's a little late for this speech, Dad.
Fine. I'll just fast-forward to the next one.
Fatherhood is harder.
- What are you talking about?
- April's pregnant.
I just found out myself.
And I got to hear this from you?
Well, I shouldn't be the one telling you.
I'll probably be in the doghouse
till next Thanksgiving
but I thought you ought to know.
- Well, I had no idea.
- Now you do.
And now you need to do the right thing.
- I have, Dad. I tried to work
things out with April. - Try harder.
Look, a bad marriage doesn't get
better because you add a kid.
No.
No, it doesn't,
but you are going to have to stop thinking
about yourself first.
You give up that right when you
bring a child into this world.
Son, you and April had the bad luck to
fall out of love at the same time
but you can get that back.
You're not hearing me, Dad.
I don't think I ever loved April.
I love Mary.
And I have to trust that.
My old friend iodine.
Okay, so what do I do here?
Just, um, dab the cotton ball in the iodine.
Put the cotton ball on the cut.
Ow!
- Gently, please.
- I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this.
- You know, I'm going to be okay, so...
- No, the doctor said that we had to
clean the wounds twice a day.
So come on, please, off with the shirt.
What do I got to close my eyes?
Oh, my God.
- You're, uh...
- What?
You're blushing.
It's a reaction to the iodine, okay?
- Ow! - I think it's a reaction to
having your shirt off in front
of me. - Don't flatter yourself.
Come on, come on, I'm not done.
Please, off with the shirt.
You know, I'd guess a lot of things
about you
but being shy in front of
women wasn't one of them.
If, we're... if we're going to do this, can we
at least talk about something else please?
- Like what?
- I don't know...
What do you usually do on Thanksgiving?
My mom and I go to
a resort in Punta Mita.
- That's Mexico.
- Hmm.
Why?
What do you do?
Uh... watch football, eat turkey,
take a nap, like everybody else I guess.
Well, you're missing out.
Lounging by the infinity pool
watching the surfer boys and sipping
what most experts would agree is
the world's finest mango margarita.
Sounds fun.
Un-American, but fun.
It was.
You're all set.
Sorry you had to suffer through that.
What's the plan, Jonah?
The day I have to answer to you, Mitchell,
we're in deeper trouble than I thought.
You don't have to answer to me.
You have to answer to them.
Hey, I always find a way.
Not today you didn't.
- They outplayed us... once.
It happens.
- No, they didn't outplay us...
she outplayed you.
Are you mad that I didn't
let you take the shot?
- That I didn't let you kill my daughter?
- You're getting soft, Jonah.
- And your mistakes are costing us.
- Saving Emily was no mistake.
What about letting Mayor Green kick
you out of town?
I mean, come on, for God...
You were taking orders from
Gracie Leigh this morning.
Hey, all you need to remember is I'm the
guy that keeps saving your ass.
You think you can do
a better job than me?
You going to make your move?
I didn't think so.
Let's go.
You think we should hold
on to these parachutes?
- I mean, they're pretty trashed.
- Why not?
You can make some of those pants
you used to wear in high school.
Hey.
What's that?
It looks like a microchip.
What's it for?
I don't know.
But I know who to ask.
They're called RFIDs--
Radio Frequency Identifiers.
- It's like a bar code, right?
- Yeah.
You know, if we had the right equipment,
we could find out who sent 'em here.
How do you know about this, Mr. Hawkins?
I read a lot, Eric.
Why are they in the chutes?
They're used for tracking
inventory, mostly by big global
companies and by one military.
- China?
- No, the U.S.
These chutes, they're from our air force.
Let me get this straight now--
we're talking about Vietnam-era
planes flying through Kansas
airspace doing a Chinese drop
and they're using U.S. Air
Force equipment to do it.
Sounds about right.
- In what world does that make sense?
- Ours.
Stanley?
- Stanley?
- In the kitchen.
You are not supposed to be up.
- You know what?
- I-I don't have a turkey, but, uh...
I do have tequila.
What about mangoes?
You know, I've never seen a mango.
- But... I have Tang.
- Instant Tang?
So in honor of your, um,
first Thanksgiving here in Jericho
I've made what some critics
believe to be the world's finest...
Tang-o margaritas.
Oh, that's awesome.
- Hey, listen, your father's not a
hundred percent, so no roughing
up the passer. - Are you kidding?
- What?
- All of it-- I mean, the football,
the Thanksgiving dinner, I mean...
- What about it? - Well, we're just
holding on to these... these traditions
like nothing happened out there?
We're holding on to these traditions
because of what happened out there.
Oh, son!
Good to see you made it.
Yeah. I'm not staying.
I was wondering if I could talk to April.
Sure.
So... it's over.
Yeah.
When were you planning on
telling me about the baby?
When I knew it wouldn't
affect your decision.
I didn't want you to stay with
me because of the baby, Eric.
- Well, I think we're the only two
people that agree on that.
- Great.
Why did you come here?
I came here to tell you that I'm sorry
for what I did
but I can't live a lie anymore.
And I'll do whatever it takes
to take care of that baby.
Why should I believe you?
You don't have to believe me.
I'll just be there.
- I think that's it.
- How do we know this thing isn't
some kind of bomb?
Well, Gray's still alive, so let's risk it, huh?
Thanks for your help, Mr. Hawkins.
- Sorry to take you away on Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.
Hey, you know what, Bill?
Could you hold off?
Just give me ten minutes.
No problem.
Thanks.
Guess we have one less dish to wash.
Did you know about all this?
Eric and Mary?
You don't have to answer that.
I knew a little.
Think it'll work out?
He says she makes him happy.
Well, what about when she doesn't make
him happy, he's gonna leave her, too?
- Dad, it's not your problem.
- I know, I know, it's just...
- my one goal when I was raising you boys
was that even when things got tough you
made the right choices. - Hi, Emily. - Hey.
Glad you could make it.
You missed the football.
I didn't want to show Jake up.
- Really.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, Jake, honey, put Emily next to you.
Thank you.
God, I hope April has a girl.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, that might've flown two hours ago.
I know.
I know, but, uh...
Wait.
Look, um, will you come with me?
There's, uh,
something I want to show you.
Please, D.
Hey, Bill.
Thanks. Go ahead.
You believe that?
Wow!
See, uh...
this is what Daddy did at work today.
Bye, Gracie.
Précédemment dans Jericho...

Papa ! J'ai besoin de toi.
Tout de suite !
Papa !
- Qu'as-tu là ?
- Un ballon.
Ouais, je vois.
Pour quoi faire ?
Tu dois m'apprendre à jouer.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que je ne sais pas.
En fait, je ne suis pas sûr
de savoir comment faire.
Ok, ok, euh... Je sais un petit peu.
- Allez.
- Quoi, on doit faire ça maintenant ?
Ouais !
D'accord.
Salut, tu fais quoi ?
Je mets une pompe manuelle sur le puits,
on pourra économiser le générateur.
Il y a vraiment un puits là-dessous ?
Le premier puits à Jericho,
vu le panneau.
Je me rappelle d'une autre première
qui s'est passée juste là-bas.
Tu n'aurais pas dû me provoquer.
- Personne n'aurait dû.  - Je me rappelle
d'un de tes grands moments !
Juste par-là, derrière le Bailey's.
Ouais, arrêtons de parler de ça,
ça va me rendre malade.
C'est ce qui arrive quand
on ne tient pas le cidre.
Tu n'arrêtais pas de chanter cette chanson
mélancolique de cette fille... chauve.
- Sinead O'Connor, c'était notre chanson.
- Notre chanson ?
Je n'ai jamais voté.
Parlons de ce qu'il s'est passé là-bas.
Le jour où tu es parti chercher
des médicaments pour ton père.
Heather t'a embrassée.
Elle m'en a parlé.
Ouais, je... je ne veux pas
qu'on lui fasse du mal.
Je n'ai pas l'intention de lui en faire.
Mme Leigh ?
Mme Leigh !
Mme Leigh.
Oh, Gracie !
Non !
Papa.
Savons-nous qui a fait ça ?
Pas de témoins.
Elle était déjà morte
quand Dale l'a trouvé.
Et si c'était Dale ?
Le sang sur le sol est sec...
Et ce gamin est incapable de faire
quelque chose comme ça.
Personne n'en est incapable
vu les circonstances actuelles.
M. le Maire, Mitchell Cafferty a
quelque chose à vous dire.
- Recule !
- Doucement.
Jonah a dit qu'il l'avait tué,
mais je ne le croyais pas.
Jonah Prowse a dit qu'il avait fait ça ?
Jonah s'est pointé à l'entrepôt,
son bras était lacéré.
Il a dit qu'il avait tué Gracie parce
qu'elle ne magouillait plus avec lui.
Il essayait de nous prouver
qu'il était toujours le chef.
- Où se trouve Jonah maintenant ?
- J'en sais rien.
- Il m'a frappé et il s'est enfui.
- Tu fais confiance à ce type, Johnston ?
Il s'est évadé de notre prison.
C'est un fugitif.
Écoutez, je comprendrais que vous
vouliez m'arrêter maintenant.
Mais si vous voulez de l'aide
pour capturer Jonah...
je suis prêt.
Eric, pourquoi ne parlerais-tu pas
un peu avec Mitch ?
Pour voir s'il peut nous aider.
Allons-y.
- Ce type est un criminel, Johnston.
- Ouais, je sais.
J'essaie de découvrir ce qu'il sait.
- On peut l'arrêter quand on veut.
- C'est le premier meurtre en 30 ans !
- Et j'ai été Maire pendant 25 ans !
- Peut-être est-ce le problème.
Tu penses toujours que Jericho est la même
gentille petite ville qu'avant les bombes.
Nous avons besoin...
- Garde ça pour les élections, Gray.
- C'est justement le sujet !
Vous voulez bien faire sortir
ce civil de la scène du crime ?
Dis-moi juste le nom de cette chanson.
Si tu ne t'en souviens pas,
je ne te le dirai pas.
Je me souviens qu'elle était
triste et mélancolique.
Tu ne devrais pas te souvenir
de notre relation.
- C'est une belle maison.
- Ouais, merci.
La première fois que Roger
et moi l'avons vu.
Nous avons fait une offre immédiatement.
Et bien, quand tu sais ce que tu veux,
pourquoi continuer à chercher ?
Merci de m'avoir raccompagnée.
Merci de m'avoir aidé pour le puits.
Salut.
Chut !
Ne dis pas un mot.

Je viens juste d'apprendre.
Je suis vraiment navré, Dale.
On a une seule piste : les aveux de Jonah,
d'après Mithell Cafferty.
Mitch n'est pas non plus un témoin.
J'étais là hier, quand Gracie
s'est opposée à Jonah.
Elle ne voulait plus faire
d'affaires avec lui.
Il n'a pas dû apprécier.
Très bien. Nous devons envoyer
des hommes patrouiller à sa recherche.
Si Jonah a bien fait ça,
il ne viendra pas de plein gré.
- Je viens aussi.
- Non, Dale.
Je sais tirer.
La dernière chose à faire c'est te
balader armé à la recherche
de l'homme qui a peut-être tué Gracie.
- C'est lui !
Vous avez dit qu'elle s'était opposée
à Jonah, et maintenant elle est morte.
Tu n'y vas pas, Dale.
Je dois te parler de quelque chose.
Gray va utiliser ceci contre toi, papa.
- Beaucoup de gens commencent à l'écouter.
- Alors, écoutez-moi.
J'ai connu Gracie toute ma vie.
Nous allons trouver celui
qui a fait ça, et le juger.
Et je ne veux plus rien entendre
à propos de ces élections.
Oui, monsieur.
Des nouvelles de Jonah ?
Non, personne ici ne l'a vu.
Il vaut mieux pour Jonah
que Gray ne le trouve pas.
Il a dit qu'il ferait de lui un exemple.
Que va-t-il faire, le pendre ?
On ne peut pas tuer quelqu'un
sur la place publique !
Ah Ouais ?
Dis ça à Gracie Leigh.
Gray est revenu transformé de Topeka.
Il ne fout pas le bordel.
Et, pour une fois,
je pense qu'il a raison.
Attends un instant.
Tu ne vas pas voter pour Gray Anderson ?
Je ne répondrai pas à ça.
On est encore en Amérique.
Ouais, si peu.
- Bonnie !
- Bonnie !
Bonnie !
Bonnie !
Bonnie !
Je suis désolé.
Je croyais que tu étais partie.
Elle ! Tu te moques de moi ?
Qu'est-ce qui te gêne ?
Grandis un peu !
Il y a longtemps que j'ai grandi.
J'ai fait tourner cette ferme à moi seule.
Je ne comprends pas ce qu'il se passe.
Tu te tapes la fille du fisc.
Elle veut me prendre ma ferme.
Tu dépasses les bornes.
OK, c'était bien.
Essaie encore.
- En quoi c'était bien ?
- J'en sais rien.
Prends le ballon.
Pourquoi on peut pas faire de passe
quand ils te courent après ?
Je ne comprends pas.
- Quand ils te courent après.
- Quand qui court après qui, fiston ?
Ceux qui veulent le ballon.
Mais t'y connais vraiment rien, bordel !
Surveille ton langage.
Il fait trop froid pour jouer
dehors sans gilets.
Comment ça se passe ?
Pas super.
Il faut que je retourne travailler.
Fiston, tout est dans la
prise en main, d'accord?
Mets ton petit doigt et ton annulaire...
Non, celui-là.
Voilà, tu le mets sur la ligne blanche.
Le pouce va en dessous.
Ok ? Alors, vas-y...
Maintenant... lance-le-moi.
OK ?
Très bien.
Voilà, c'est parfait.
Je croyais que c'était
le basket ton sport.
Je me débrouille dans tous les sports.
- Salut, Jake.
- Il faut que tu m'aides.
J'arrive.
Où est-ce qu'on va ?
À la planque de Jonah.
Mon père et Eric nous retrouvent là-bas.
Tu penses qu'il y est toujours ?
Je pense qu'il n'a pas trop d'endroit où
aller, ni de personnes de confiance.
Il doit avoir d'autres amis en ville,
ou de la famille.
Accroche-toi.
Et s'ils le trouvent pas ?
Il peut pas s'en sortir comme ça.
Ils le trouveront.
Qu'est-ce que je suis censé faire ?
Assieds-toi, Dale.
Tu dois savoir certaines choses.
Viens.
Après les explosions...
et la mort de ta mère,
Gracie a modifié son testament.
Elle te lègue le magasin.
J'étais témoin. Les papiers sont dans
un coffre à la banque, avec les clés.
Personne ne s'attend à voir un
jeune homme de 16 ans gérer ça.
Prends ton temps...
et réfléchis à ce que tu vas faire.
Je suis là si tu as besoin de moi.
Je ne peux pas reprendre le magasin.
J'ai démissionné.
Je l'ai traitée de menteuse,
et des pires noms...
Ça arrive...
Les gens craquent parfois,
disent des choses,
mais ça n'efface pas le passé.
Gracie t'aimait,
et elle voulait que tu reprennes
son magasin.
Allez les gars, fouillez partout.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais, Gray ?
- Une chasse à l'homme, comme toi.
Je pense que Jonah est venue rendre
une visite de courtoisie à Emily.
- On s'en occupe.
- Ah ouais ? Qui on ?
Ceux qui ont été entraînés
pour protéger la ville.
- Vous faites un sacré boulot !
- C'est dangereux, Gray.
Quelques sentinelles autour
de la ville ne suffisent pas.
Trop tard pour ça... J'ai vu deux camions
remplis de gars louches trainer par là,
la ville va droit au chaos.
Ça ne se calmera pas tant qu'on ne
trouvera pas Jonah Prowse.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- On cherche Jonah Prowse.
Il a tué Gracie Leigh.
- Puisque c'est votre père...
- Je ne vois pas le rapport.
Et bien, on aimerait
jeter un coup d'oeil.
- Non
- Elle ne le cacherait pas, Gray.
On va juste jeter un coup d'oeil,
et on s'en va.
- Aucune trace de lui dans le jardin.
- Bonne nouvelle.
Venez, je vais patrouiller avec vous.
On y va, Gray.
Surveillez cette maison.
<i>On y va.</i>
- Merci.  - Où est-il ?
- Je ne comprends pas...
Tu n'as pas semblé surprise pour Gracie
Où est-il ?
Jake...
Je n'ai pas tué Gracie Leigh.
Alors pourquoi tu nous braques ?
Au cas où tu ne me croirais pas.
Tu vas peut-être essayer de jouer
au héros pour me piéger.
- Il saigne, il a besoin d'un médecin.
- Je n'irai pas en ville.
- Jake, tu vas m'aider à sortir de là.
- Je ne t'aiderai pas.
- A ce que je sais, t'es un meurtrier.
- C'était pas moi !
Quand je suis sorti ce matin,
mes hommes m'ont encerclé...
Mitchell Cafferty était là.
Il m'a dit...
que Gracie avait été tuée.
J'ai demandé qui avait fait ça...
et Mitchell m'a répondu
"C'est toi, et j'ai tout vu."
Et subitement, il a sorti un couteau...
et il m'a ouvert le bras.
Mais je l'ai frappé avec un pied de biche
avant qu'il finisse le boulot.
Tes gars sont avec Mitch ?
Ils n'ont pas trop aimé... que ma propre
fille vole notre marchandise...
et que j'empêche Mitchell de la flinguer.
Ils ont fait ça parce que
t'as pas voulu me tuer ?
- Ok, ok, ok.
- Relève-le.
On va le garder ici...
mais il faut qu'on soit prudent.
Pas mal de gens dehors aimeraient
d'abord le tuer puis le questionner.
Mitchell reviendra,
jusqu'à ce qu'il me tue.
On va l'emmener à la Mairie.
Tu seras en sécurité là-bas.
Ces gars iront me chercher là-bas...
ils me tueront, ainsi que...
- Pourquoi t'es venu ici, hein ?
- Tu mets ta fille en danger.
- La ferme ! Il faut...
Il faut qu'on lui trouve un docteur.
Ok, ok.
- Dale.
- Salut.
Qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passé ?
Elle a été tuée... poignardée.
- Dale...
- Dale !
Je viens d'apprendre...
<i>C'est toi qui l'as trouvée ?</i>
Ouais.
Ouvre la porte, qu'on s'éclate.
Dégage, Sean.
De quoi tu te mêles ?
- C'est pas ta boutique.
- Si, ça l'est.
- Entièrement.
- De quoi tu parles ?
Gracie me l'a léguée.
Ça marche bien pour toi alors...
Dale !
Arrête !
- T'as de la chance que je t'explose pas.
- Va-t'en, Sean.
Sean, ça va ?
<i>Viens, on se casse.</i>
On se voit plus tard ?
- Tu l'as trouvé ?
- Non, pas encore.
J'ai un truc à faire au sous-sol,
et je retourne voir Gray et ses hommes...
Entre ce sous-sol et
ces hommes armés...
Hé...
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Robert, est-ce que c'est ce qu'on
cherchait en venant ici ?
Des gens révoltés, toi courant partout
avec un flingue à la main ?
Ça n'a pas beaucoup changé.
Ouais, ça allait tellement bien
entre nous, n'est-ce pas ?
Alors, on va te perdre à nouveau ?
Me perdre ?
Je ne pensais pas que tu...
Les enfants s'habituent à te voir ici.
Ah ouais ?
Et toi, D ?
Moi aussi.
Je ne veux aller nulle part.
Je suis bien ici.
Tu fermes le sous-sol...
ou tu dis à ces hommes de se débrouiller
et tu restes à la maison.
Ce monde est en perdition.
Tu ne peux pas rester avec nous ?
Kenchy...
il faut que tu viennes avec moi.
Où ?
Je te le dirai en allant au centre
médical, d'accord ? Écoute...
On a besoin de ton aide.
Oh... Tu veux que je tue quelqu'un ?
Trouve un vrai docteur mon pote.
Un vrai docteur ne ferait pas
ce que je vais te demander.
Allez, on y va.
C'est grave ?
Celui qui a fait ça a utilisé
un couteau dentelé.
On a vraiment besoin de ça ?
- T'as arrêté l'hémorragie ?
- À peu près.
Je lui ai donné un calmant
pour la douleur.
Il va sûrement s'endormir.
Est-ce que c'est lui ?
Le meurtrier dont tout le monde parle ?
Il dit que non.
Personne ne le croira.
Ils sont assoiffés de sang.
Il n'a aucune chance.
Bien sûr que si...
Je vais chercher mon père. Il le ramènera
et veillera à ce qu'il ne lui arrive rien.
C'est sa seule chance.
- OK.
- Très bien.
Verrouille la porte.
Est-ce que je peux me laver les mains ?
<i>"Nouveau Message"</i>
<i>"Réponse urgente."
"Envoyez vos coordonnées dès que possible."</i>
<i>"Mes coordonnées sont"</i>
<i>"Je suis compromis."
"Poursuivez sans moi"</i>
Nous ne sommes pas en sécurité.
La mort de Gracie vient de
nous le rappeler durement.
Je vais te dire, Mary,
Le chaos que j'ai traversé quand je
luttais pour revenir à Jericho...
est maintenant présent,
ici, dans notre ville.
Les truands comme Jonah Prowse pensent
que nous sommes des cibles faciles.
Je vais te dire, Neil.
Nous devrions trouver Jonah Prowse
et faire de lui un exemple.
Et il en prendra pour 15 ans,
en se demandant ce qu'il lui arrive.
Nous devons faire passer un message.
Les actions criminelles
ne seront pas tolérées.
Nous allons tout faire
pour sécuriser Jericho.
<i>Et souvenez-vous...</i>
- Papa, j'ai besoin de ton aide.
<i>- ...de voter Gray Anderson...</i>
<i>... pour un nouveau Jericho.</i>
Fais gaffe.
Je suis désolé, maman.
Oh, non, non.
Nous n'allons pas jouer à ça.
Allez, c'est bon.
Appelle-moi papa !
Franchement, ça me fait peur.
- En bien ou en mal ?
- Quoi ?
Bon.
Ce que nous avons fait...
ce n'est pas ce que tu penses.
J'ai eu un moment de faiblesse.
C'était une erreur.
Je suis très fort pour faire des erreurs.
Oui, c'est sûr.
Crois-moi, c'était un plaisir,
mais nous ne pouvons pas recommencer.
À cause de Bonnie ?
Je lui parlerai.
Elle comprendra.
Sais-tu combien de rencards
j'ai eus les cinq dernières années ?
Très peu je pense.
Sais-tu pourquoi ?
Oui, tu es antipathique, tu ne fais
que te plaindre et penser à toi.
Exactement.
Et toi, tu es gentil, naturel, et borné.
Tu n'as pas besoin de
quelqu'un comme moi.
Ça ne peut pas marcher.
C'est ce qu'ils ont dit de Brangelina.
Es-tu vraiment en train
de citer "Us Magazine" ?
Comment ils nous auraient appelés ?
Stimiley ?
Mimiley ?
Stini !
Tu es trop bête.
- Tu défends un criminel Jake.
- Il est blessé.
Et il a besoin d'un docteur, je suis allé
le chercher, et me voilà.
Bon, nous avons là un sérieux
problème Jake.
Si quelqu'un apprend que tu caches
Jonah Prowse...
alors que toute la ville le cherche,
ils vont tous nous boucler.
Jonah dit que Mitchell a tué
Gracie et qu'il l'a piégé.
T'en penses quoi ?
- Il dit peut-être la vérité.
- Tu n'es ni juge ni juré.
- On va le chercher et l'emmener...
- C'est pour ça que je suis là !
Tu devrais plutôt espérer...
Il s'est enfui.
Attrapons-le !
Allez, allez !
- C'est lui !
- Attrapez-le !
Bien, bien...
Jonah Prowse.
Relevez-le !
Levez-le les mecs.
Très bien, allons-y.
Sors du camion.
Jurez-vous solennellement de représenter
la loi du Kansas,
et d'assumer les devoirs d'un maire ?
- Je le jure.
- Félicitations.
Mes amis...
merci de m'avoir fait confiance pour
sortir Jericho de cette période difficile.
Cette ville nous appartient à tous et
nous devons nous soutenir pour survivre.
Les ressources de cette ville
nous appartiennent aussi.
Ainsi, comme premier acte
en tant que maire...
Je décide que la nourriture parachutée
soit distribuée sur le champ.
Concernant la sécurité...
Un de nos concitoyens vient d'être
froidement abattu.
Les meurtriers devront
répondre de leurs actes.
Justice sera faite,
je vous en fais le serment.
Ne prends pas ça trop au sérieux.
Ils ne vont pas demander
ta tête sur un plateau.
Pourquoi t'es-tu enfui ?
- Mon père allait te...
- Ton père vient de se faire virer, Jake.
Je ne voulais pas cela.
Jonah a fait son propre choix.
Je suis désolée que ton père
ait perdu les élections.
- Je pense que si je ne t'avais pas
impliqué... - Non.
Les gens se sont exprimés,
et ils ont eu ce qu'ils voulaient.
Que veut tu Mitchell ?
Je visite.
Hep, mignonne ?
Peux-tu nous laisser parler en privé ?
C'est bon.
Je reviens...
- Donc, on va devenir partenaires ?
- Où as-tu entendu ça ?
Tu fais tourner le magasin, tu vas avoir
besoin de protection.
Contre qui ?
Jonah est en prison.
Ça n'a rien a voir avec Jonah.
Ne fais pas la même erreur que Gracie.
Je prends mes 50%.
Ou les gens dehors porteront des
fleurs et des cierges sur ta tombe.
OK ?
A demain...
Et après demain.
Et les jours suivants.
Tu tricotes ?
Oui, c'est une des rares choses
qui me changent les idées.
J'ai appris ça en pension à Vassar.
Tu n'as plus envie de moi
maintenant, n'est-ce pas ?
Non c'est juste que...
En fait, c'était à ma mère.
Mon Dieu.
Je suis... Vraiment désolée.
- Je l'ai trouvé dans un carton là-haut.
- C'est bon. - Non, non ,non.
- Je... je vais les remettre.
- Non, non, non. Je pense...
Je pense que tu devrais le terminer.
Non, je n'y arriverai pas.
Écoute, c'est pas grave.
Finalement, je pense que
ma mère t'aurait appréciée.
- Vraiment ?
- Non, pas du tout.
Manley.
- Hein ?
- C'est notre nom pour le magazine.
Mimi et Stanley. Manley.
C'est vraiment le message que
tu veux faire passer ?
Tu as raison. Un point pour toi.
Stimi, c'est mieux.
Papa...
Il faudrait enlever toutes ces affiches.
Que cet endroit revienne à la normale.
Je ne pense pas que tout
redevienne normal un jour.
Oui.
Je, euh...
Je suis désolé.
Moi aussi.
M. le Maire !
C'est Mitchell Cafferty qui l'a fait.
Quoi ?
- Il a tué Gracie.
- De quoi tu parles, Dale ?
Si je refuse de lui donner sa part, il m'a
menacé de me faire pareil qu'à Gracie.
Allons chercher Gray.
Très bien, Jonah.
Debout. Allons-y.
Allons-y.
- Tu m'emmènes où ?
- Tu le sauras quand on y sera.
Gray, tu fais quoi ?
On l'emmène dans un
endroit plus sûr.
Beaucoup de gens veulent le tuer
après ce qu'il a fait.
On ne sait pas ce qu'il a fait.
Il n'a pas été jugé.
Les circonstances sont exceptionnelles,
Johnston.
Nous n'avons pas de juge.
En tant que Maire, j'ai rassemblé un
jury qui l'a déclaré coupable.
Tu as fait quoi ?
Mitch a menacé Dale de lui faire la même
chose qu'à Gracie s'il ne coopérait pas.
Quelqu'un d'autre l'a entendu ?
- Non.
- Ce n'est pas une preuve.
- Tu penses que je mens ?
- Il voulait juste t'intimider.
-  Ça ne veut rien dire.
- C'est incroyable.
Tu te fiches de la vérité.
- Tu veux juste Jonah.
- Je l'ai !
- Il est innocent.
- Il est loin d'être innocent !
Ça fait des années
qu'il rôde dans cette ville !
À partir de maintenant,
les types comme lui dégagent !
On ne fait pas de marché avec eux.
Tu comptes faire quoi, Gray ?
Tu veux le tuer de sang-froid ?
Dire qu'il a tenté de s'échapper pendant
que vous le mettiez en lieu sûr ?
Qui va le faire ?
Bill ?
Tu vas lui mettre une balle dans la tête
quand Gray te dira de le faire ?
Je ne vais tuer personne.
C'est à toi de voir, Gray.
<i>Vas-y.</i>
Non ?
C'est bien ce que tu veux, non ?
Tu décides des règles,
de qui doit vivre ou mourir ?
Vas-y et fais-le.
Mais tu le fais ici, devant moi et Dale.
Devant tout le monde.
Pas... pas dans une pièce au fond
avec tes copains.
Ne laisse pas quelqu'un d'autre
faire le sale boulot.
Tu veux le voir mort ? Alors prends
ce flingue et descends-le.
Gray, non !
Il vaudrait mieux que tu sois tout à fait
sûr qu'il soit coupable. Sinon...
Tu seras un meurtrier,
et justice sera vite faite.
Jonah a accepté de quitter la ville
et de ne plus revenir.
- L'exil.
- Ça a marché pour les Grecs.
La ville est débarrassée
de Jonah Prowse...
et tu as le beau rôle.
Très bien.
- Et Mitchell Cafferty ?
- Laisse-moi m'en occuper.
Écoute... Johnston, j'aime cette ville.
Et je veux qu'on y soit en sécurité,
comme on l'a toujours été.
Ça a toujours été une démocratie.
C'est facile quand tout va bien.
Mais quand les gens ont peur,
ou paniquent...
ça devient beaucoup plus dur.
- Je vais tenter d'y veiller.
- Je crois que nous allons tous le faire.
Mon père, ton grand-père, était un
excellent athlète, tu le savais ?
Dans tous les sports, Sam.
Il a gagné plein de médailles
quand il était à l'école.
Mais, quand j'avais ton âge,
il était dans l'armée de l'air.
Il était souvent absent, et n'a pas eu le
temps de m'apprendre grand-chose, donc...
- Sam, c'est pour ça que je suis
nul au foot.  - Moi aussi.
Désolé, Fiston.
Oui.
Oh, la voilà.
Tu es prêt ?
Tu t'entraînes beaucoup.
Et voilà, entraîneur.
Je suis là.
D'accord ? Je suis là.
Robert !
Hé, ce n'est pas ce que tous les
joueurs de foot font entre eux ?
Tiens, ça va te tenir chaud.
- Emily, quand Chris est né...
- Non.
Quand Chris est né,
tu avais quatre ans.
Ta mère disait qu'elle
voulait faire une pause.
Je traversais une mauvaise passe,
et elle ne voulait pas que Chris
et toi grandissiez là-dedans,
alors je l'ai laissée partir.
Mais je ne le voulais pas.
Elle ne t'a jamais oublié.
Nous nous aimions.
- C'était comme...
- Comme toi et Jake.
Ne rends pas Jake responsable
de la mort de ton frère.
C'est ma faute.
C'est moi qui ai poussé
Chris à faire ce boulot.
Il n'était pas prêt.
Il n'était pas destiné à cette vie.
Jake m'en a voulu.
Je ne l'ai pas compris à l'époque...
mais maintenant oui.
Ce garçon t'aime toujours.
Il n'y a pas de couvre-feu,
ou un truc dans le genre ?
Non.
Génial.
Alors c'est pour ça que tu
réservais ta ration d'énergie.
Chouette musique, Mary.
Je boirais du café froid à la lumière
des bougies toute ma vie,
si je pouvais juste écouter de
la musique de temps en temps.
Tu sais que je t'aime, hein ?
Oui.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Comment ça s'est passé ?
Il est parti.
C'est ce qu'il y a de mieux
pour l'instant.
Oui.
J'imagine qu'il n'y a pas
de cidre ici, non ?
T'as envie de parler ?
Non. C'est plutôt le contraire.
Mary, tu peux nous resservir de...
ce que tu es en train de verser ?
C'est presque comme avant ici.
Comme s'il n'y avait pas eu de bombes.
Restons ici autant que possible, hein ?
Je me suis enfin souvenu
du nom de cette chanson.
Elle était dans le Jukebox de Mary.
Allez.
Allez !
Et Heather ?
Et Roger ?
Tu sais bien...
On devrait se conduire en adultes,
et partir d'ici tout de suite.
Tu as raison.
C'est ce qu'on devrait faire.
- Jake ! Viens voir dehors, maintenant.
- Allons-y.
Ils ont besoin d'aide.
Emmène-les à l'intérieur.
Jake !
Certains d'entre eux étaient en avion,
ils ont atterri au milieu de nulle part.
Ça fait des semaines qu'ils marchent.
Ils ont dû vivre un enfer.
Oh mon Dieu !
Roger.
Qui c'est, merde ?

Papa ! J'ai besoin de toi.
Tout de suite !
Papa !
- Qu'as-tu là ?
- Un ballon.
Ouais, je vois.
Pour quoi faire ?
Tu dois m'apprendre à jouer.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que je ne sais pas.
En fait, je ne suis pas sûr
de savoir comment faire.
Ok, ok, euh... Je sais un petit peu.
- Allez.
- Quoi, on doit faire ça maintenant ?
Ouais !
D'accord.
Salut, tu fais quoi ?
Je mets une pompe manuelle sur le puits,
on pourra économiser le générateur.
Il y a vraiment un puits là-dessous ?
Le premier puits à Jericho,
vu le panneau.
Je me rappelle d'une autre première
qui s'est passée juste là-bas.
Tu n'aurais pas dû me provoquer.
- Personne n'aurait dû.  - Je me rappelle
d'un de tes grands moments !
Juste par-là, derrière le Bailey's.
Ouais, arrêtons de parler de ça,
ça va me rendre malade.
C'est ce qui arrive quand
on ne tient pas le cidre.
Tu n'arrêtais pas de chanter cette chanson
mélancolique de cette fille... chauve.
- Sinead O'Connor, c'était notre chanson.
- Notre chanson ?
Je n'ai jamais voté.
Parlons de ce qu'il s'est passé là-bas.
Le jour où tu es parti chercher
des médicaments pour ton père.
Heather t'a embrassée.
Elle m'en a parlé.
Ouais, je... je ne veux pas
qu'on lui fasse du mal.
Je n'ai pas l'intention de lui en faire.
Mme Leigh ?
Mme Leigh !
Mme Leigh.
Oh, Gracie !
Non !
Papa.
Savons-nous qui a fait ça ?
Pas de témoins.
Elle était déjà morte
quand Dale l'a trouvé.
Et si c'était Dale ?
Le sang sur le sol est sec...
Et ce gamin est incapable de faire
quelque chose comme ça.
Personne n'en est incapable
vu les circonstances actuelles.
M. le Maire, Mitchell Cafferty a
quelque chose à vous dire.
- Recule !
- Doucement.
Jonah a dit qu'il l'avait tué,
mais je ne le croyais pas.
Jonah Prowse a dit qu'il avait fait ça ?
Jonah s'est pointé à l'entrepôt,
son bras était lacéré.
Il a dit qu'il avait tué Gracie parce
qu'elle ne magouillait plus avec lui.
Il essayait de nous prouver
qu'il était toujours le chef.
- Où se trouve Jonah maintenant ?
- J'en sais rien.
- Il m'a frappé et il s'est enfui.
- Tu fais confiance à ce type, Johnston ?
Il s'est évadé de notre prison.
C'est un fugitif.
Écoutez, je comprendrais que vous
vouliez m'arrêter maintenant.
Mais si vous voulez de l'aide
pour capturer Jonah...
je suis prêt.
Eric, pourquoi ne parlerais-tu pas
un peu avec Mitch ?
Pour voir s'il peut nous aider.
Allons-y.
- Ce type est un criminel, Johnston.
- Ouais, je sais.
J'essaie de découvrir ce qu'il sait.
- On peut l'arrêter quand on veut.
- C'est le premier meurtre en 30 ans !
- Et j'ai été Maire pendant 25 ans !
- Peut-être est-ce le problème.
Tu penses toujours que Jericho est la même
gentille petite ville qu'avant les bombes.
Nous avons besoin...
- Garde ça pour les élections, Gray.
- C'est justement le sujet !
Vous voulez bien faire sortir
ce civil de la scène du crime ?
Dis-moi juste le nom de cette chanson.
Si tu ne t'en souviens pas,
je ne te le dirai pas.
Je me souviens qu'elle était
triste et mélancolique.
Tu ne devrais pas te souvenir
de notre relation.
- C'est une belle maison.
- Ouais, merci.
La première fois que Roger
et moi l'avons vu.
Nous avons fait une offre immédiatement.
Et bien, quand tu sais ce que tu veux,
pourquoi continuer à chercher ?
Merci de m'avoir raccompagnée.
Merci de m'avoir aidé pour le puits.
Salut.
Chut !
Ne dis pas un mot.

Je viens juste d'apprendre.
Je suis vraiment navré, Dale.
On a une seule piste : les aveux de Jonah,
d'après Mithell Cafferty.
Mitch n'est pas non plus un témoin.
J'étais là hier, quand Gracie
s'est opposée à Jonah.
Elle ne voulait plus faire
d'affaires avec lui.
Il n'a pas dû apprécier.
Très bien. Nous devons envoyer
des hommes patrouiller à sa recherche.
Si Jonah a bien fait ça,
il ne viendra pas de plein gré.
- Je viens aussi.
- Non, Dale.
Je sais tirer.
La dernière chose à faire c'est te
balader armé à la recherche
de l'homme qui a peut-être tué Gracie.
- C'est lui !
Vous avez dit qu'elle s'était opposée
à Jonah, et maintenant elle est morte.
Tu n'y vas pas, Dale.
Je dois te parler de quelque chose.
Gray va utiliser ceci contre toi, papa.
- Beaucoup de gens commencent à l'écouter.
- Alors, écoutez-moi.
J'ai connu Gracie toute ma vie.
Nous allons trouver celui
qui a fait ça, et le juger.
Et je ne veux plus rien entendre
à propos de ces élections.
Oui, monsieur.
Des nouvelles de Jonah ?
Non, personne ici ne l'a vu.
Il vaut mieux pour Jonah
que Gray ne le trouve pas.
Il a dit qu'il ferait de lui un exemple.
Que va-t-il faire, le pendre ?
On ne peut pas tuer quelqu'un
sur la place publique !
Ah Ouais ?
Dis ça à Gracie Leigh.
Gray est revenu transformé de Topeka.
Il ne fout pas le bordel.
Et, pour une fois,
je pense qu'il a raison.
Attends un instant.
Tu ne vas pas voter pour Gray Anderson ?
Je ne répondrai pas à ça.
On est encore en Amérique.
Ouais, si peu.
- Bonnie !
- Bonnie !
Bonnie !
Bonnie !
Bonnie !
Je suis désolé.
Je croyais que tu étais partie.
Elle ! Tu te moques de moi ?
Qu'est-ce qui te gêne ?
Grandis un peu !
Il y a longtemps que j'ai grandi.
J'ai fait tourner cette ferme à moi seule.
Je ne comprends pas ce qu'il se passe.
Tu te tapes la fille du fisc.
Elle veut me prendre ma ferme.
Tu dépasses les bornes.
OK, c'était bien.
Essaie encore.
- En quoi c'était bien ?
- J'en sais rien.
Prends le ballon.
Pourquoi on peut pas faire de passe
quand ils te courent après ?
Je ne comprends pas.
- Quand ils te courent après.
- Quand qui court après qui, fiston ?
Ceux qui veulent le ballon.
Mais t'y connais vraiment rien, bordel !
Surveille ton langage.
Il fait trop froid pour jouer
dehors sans gilets.
Comment ça se passe ?
Pas super.
Il faut que je retourne travailler.
Fiston, tout est dans la
prise en main, d'accord?
Mets ton petit doigt et ton annulaire...
Non, celui-là.
Voilà, tu le mets sur la ligne blanche.
Le pouce va en dessous.
Ok ? Alors, vas-y...
Maintenant... lance-le-moi.
OK ?
Très bien.
Voilà, c'est parfait.
Je croyais que c'était
le basket ton sport.
Je me débrouille dans tous les sports.
- Salut, Jake.
- Il faut que tu m'aides.
J'arrive.
Où est-ce qu'on va ?
À la planque de Jonah.
Mon père et Eric nous retrouvent là-bas.
Tu penses qu'il y est toujours ?
Je pense qu'il n'a pas trop d'endroit où
aller, ni de personnes de confiance.
Il doit avoir d'autres amis en ville,
ou de la famille.
Accroche-toi.
Et s'ils le trouvent pas ?
Il peut pas s'en sortir comme ça.
Ils le trouveront.
Qu'est-ce que je suis censé faire ?
Assieds-toi, Dale.
Tu dois savoir certaines choses.
Viens.
Après les explosions...
et la mort de ta mère,
Gracie a modifié son testament.
Elle te lègue le magasin.
J'étais témoin. Les papiers sont dans
un coffre à la banque, avec les clés.
Personne ne s'attend à voir un
jeune homme de 16 ans gérer ça.
Prends ton temps...
et réfléchis à ce que tu vas faire.
Je suis là si tu as besoin de moi.
Je ne peux pas reprendre le magasin.
J'ai démissionné.
Je l'ai traitée de menteuse,
et des pires noms...
Ça arrive...
Les gens craquent parfois,
disent des choses,
mais ça n'efface pas le passé.
Gracie t'aimait,
et elle voulait que tu reprennes
son magasin.
Allez les gars, fouillez partout.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais, Gray ?
- Une chasse à l'homme, comme toi.
Je pense que Jonah est venue rendre
une visite de courtoisie à Emily.
- On s'en occupe.
- Ah ouais ? Qui on ?
Ceux qui ont été entraînés
pour protéger la ville.
- Vous faites un sacré boulot !
- C'est dangereux, Gray.
Quelques sentinelles autour
de la ville ne suffisent pas.
Trop tard pour ça... J'ai vu deux camions
remplis de gars louches trainer par là,
la ville va droit au chaos.
Ça ne se calmera pas tant qu'on ne
trouvera pas Jonah Prowse.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- On cherche Jonah Prowse.
Il a tué Gracie Leigh.
- Puisque c'est votre père...
- Je ne vois pas le rapport.
Et bien, on aimerait
jeter un coup d'oeil.
- Non
- Elle ne le cacherait pas, Gray.
On va juste jeter un coup d'oeil,
et on s'en va.
- Aucune trace de lui dans le jardin.
- Bonne nouvelle.
Venez, je vais patrouiller avec vous.
On y va, Gray.
Surveillez cette maison.
<i>On y va.</i>
- Merci.  - Où est-il ?
- Je ne comprends pas...
Tu n'as pas semblé surprise pour Gracie
Où est-il ?
Jake...
Je n'ai pas tué Gracie Leigh.
Alors pourquoi tu nous braques ?
Au cas où tu ne me croirais pas.
Tu vas peut-être essayer de jouer
au héros pour me piéger.
- Il saigne, il a besoin d'un médecin.
- Je n'irai pas en ville.
- Jake, tu vas m'aider à sortir de là.
- Je ne t'aiderai pas.
- A ce que je sais, t'es un meurtrier.
- C'était pas moi !
Quand je suis sorti ce matin,
mes hommes m'ont encerclé...
Mitchell Cafferty était là.
Il m'a dit...
que Gracie avait été tuée.
J'ai demandé qui avait fait ça...
et Mitchell m'a répondu
"C'est toi, et j'ai tout vu."
Et subitement, il a sorti un couteau...
et il m'a ouvert le bras.
Mais je l'ai frappé avec un pied de biche
avant qu'il finisse le boulot.
Tes gars sont avec Mitch ?
Ils n'ont pas trop aimé... que ma propre
fille vole notre marchandise...
et que j'empêche Mitchell de la flinguer.
Ils ont fait ça parce que
t'as pas voulu me tuer ?
- Ok, ok, ok.
- Relève-le.
On va le garder ici...
mais il faut qu'on soit prudent.
Pas mal de gens dehors aimeraient
d'abord le tuer puis le questionner.
Mitchell reviendra,
jusqu'à ce qu'il me tue.
On va l'emmener à la Mairie.
Tu seras en sécurité là-bas.
Ces gars iront me chercher là-bas...
ils me tueront, ainsi que...
- Pourquoi t'es venu ici, hein ?
- Tu mets ta fille en danger.
- La ferme ! Il faut...
Il faut qu'on lui trouve un docteur.
Ok, ok.
- Dale.
- Salut.
Qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passé ?
Elle a été tuée... poignardée.
- Dale...
- Dale !
Je viens d'apprendre...
<i>C'est toi qui l'as trouvée ?</i>
Ouais.
Ouvre la porte, qu'on s'éclate.
Dégage, Sean.
De quoi tu te mêles ?
- C'est pas ta boutique.
- Si, ça l'est.
- Entièrement.
- De quoi tu parles ?
Gracie me l'a léguée.
Ça marche bien pour toi alors...
Dale !
Arrête !
- T'as de la chance que je t'explose pas.
- Va-t'en, Sean.
Sean, ça va ?
<i>Viens, on se casse.</i>
On se voit plus tard ?
- Tu l'as trouvé ?
- Non, pas encore.
J'ai un truc à faire au sous-sol,
et je retourne voir Gray et ses hommes...
Entre ce sous-sol et
ces hommes armés...
Hé...
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Robert, est-ce que c'est ce qu'on
cherchait en venant ici ?
Des gens révoltés, toi courant partout
avec un flingue à la main ?
Ça n'a pas beaucoup changé.
Ouais, ça allait tellement bien
entre nous, n'est-ce pas ?
Alors, on va te perdre à nouveau ?
Me perdre ?
Je ne pensais pas que tu...
Les enfants s'habituent à te voir ici.
Ah ouais ?
Et toi, D ?
Moi aussi.
Je ne veux aller nulle part.
Je suis bien ici.
Tu fermes le sous-sol...
ou tu dis à ces hommes de se débrouiller
et tu restes à la maison.
Ce monde est en perdition.
Tu ne peux pas rester avec nous ?
Kenchy...
il faut que tu viennes avec moi.
Où ?
Je te le dirai en allant au centre
médical, d'accord ? Écoute...
On a besoin de ton aide.
Oh... Tu veux que je tue quelqu'un ?
Trouve un vrai docteur mon pote.
Un vrai docteur ne ferait pas
ce que je vais te demander.
Allez, on y va.
C'est grave ?
Celui qui a fait ça a utilisé
un couteau dentelé.
On a vraiment besoin de ça ?
- T'as arrêté l'hémorragie ?
- À peu près.
Je lui ai donné un calmant
pour la douleur.
Il va sûrement s'endormir.
Est-ce que c'est lui ?
Le meurtrier dont tout le monde parle ?
Il dit que non.
Personne ne le croira.
Ils sont assoiffés de sang.
Il n'a aucune chance.
Bien sûr que si...
Je vais chercher mon père. Il le ramènera
et veillera à ce qu'il ne lui arrive rien.
C'est sa seule chance.
- OK.
- Très bien.
Verrouille la porte.
Est-ce que je peux me laver les mains ?
<i>"Nouveau Message"</i>
<i>"Réponse urgente."
"Envoyez vos coordonnées dès que possible."</i>
<i>"Mes coordonnées sont"</i>
<i>"Je suis compromis."
"Poursuivez sans moi"</i>
Nous ne sommes pas en sécurité.
La mort de Gracie vient de
nous le rappeler durement.
Je vais te dire, Mary,
Le chaos que j'ai traversé quand je
luttais pour revenir à Jericho...
est maintenant présent,
ici, dans notre ville.
Les truands comme Jonah Prowse pensent
que nous sommes des cibles faciles.
Je vais te dire, Neil.
Nous devrions trouver Jonah Prowse
et faire de lui un exemple.
Et il en prendra pour 15 ans,
en se demandant ce qu'il lui arrive.
Nous devons faire passer un message.
Les actions criminelles
ne seront pas tolérées.
Nous allons tout faire
pour sécuriser Jericho.
<i>Et souvenez-vous...</i>
- Papa, j'ai besoin de ton aide.
<i>- ...de voter Gray Anderson...</i>
<i>... pour un nouveau Jericho.</i>
Fais gaffe.
Je suis désolé, maman.
Oh, non, non.
Nous n'allons pas jouer à ça.
Allez, c'est bon.
Appelle-moi papa !
Franchement, ça me fait peur.
- En bien ou en mal ?
- Quoi ?
Bon.
Ce que nous avons fait...
ce n'est pas ce que tu penses.
J'ai eu un moment de faiblesse.
C'était une erreur.
Je suis très fort pour faire des erreurs.
Oui, c'est sûr.
Crois-moi, c'était un plaisir,
mais nous ne pouvons pas recommencer.
À cause de Bonnie ?
Je lui parlerai.
Elle comprendra.
Sais-tu combien de rencards
j'ai eus les cinq dernières années ?
Très peu je pense.
Sais-tu pourquoi ?
Oui, tu es antipathique, tu ne fais
que te plaindre et penser à toi.
Exactement.
Et toi, tu es gentil, naturel, et borné.
Tu n'as pas besoin de
quelqu'un comme moi.
Ça ne peut pas marcher.
C'est ce qu'ils ont dit de Brangelina.
Es-tu vraiment en train
de citer "Us Magazine" ?
Comment ils nous auraient appelés ?
Stimiley ?
Mimiley ?
Stini !
Tu es trop bête.
- Tu défends un criminel Jake.
- Il est blessé.
Et il a besoin d'un docteur, je suis allé
le chercher, et me voilà.
Bon, nous avons là un sérieux
problème Jake.
Si quelqu'un apprend que tu caches
Jonah Prowse...
alors que toute la ville le cherche,
ils vont tous nous boucler.
Jonah dit que Mitchell a tué
Gracie et qu'il l'a piégé.
T'en penses quoi ?
- Il dit peut-être la vérité.
- Tu n'es ni juge ni juré.
- On va le chercher et l'emmener...
- C'est pour ça que je suis là !
Tu devrais plutôt espérer...
Il s'est enfui.
Attrapons-le !
Allez, allez !
- C'est lui !
- Attrapez-le !
Bien, bien...
Jonah Prowse.
Relevez-le !
Levez-le les mecs.
Très bien, allons-y.
Sors du camion.
Jurez-vous solennellement de représenter
la loi du Kansas,
et d'assumer les devoirs d'un maire ?
- Je le jure.
- Félicitations.
Mes amis...
merci de m'avoir fait confiance pour
sortir Jericho de cette période difficile.
Cette ville nous appartient à tous et
nous devons nous soutenir pour survivre.
Les ressources de cette ville
nous appartiennent aussi.
Ainsi, comme premier acte
en tant que maire...
Je décide que la nourriture parachutée
soit distribuée sur le champ.
Concernant la sécurité...
Un de nos concitoyens vient d'être
froidement abattu.
Les meurtriers devront
répondre de leurs actes.
Justice sera faite,
je vous en fais le serment.
Ne prends pas ça trop au sérieux.
Ils ne vont pas demander
ta tête sur un plateau.
Pourquoi t'es-tu enfui ?
- Mon père allait te...
- Ton père vient de se faire virer, Jake.
Je ne voulais pas cela.
Jonah a fait son propre choix.
Je suis désolée que ton père
ait perdu les élections.
- Je pense que si je ne t'avais pas
impliqué... - Non.
Les gens se sont exprimés,
et ils ont eu ce qu'ils voulaient.
Que veut tu Mitchell ?
Je visite.
Hep, mignonne ?
Peux-tu nous laisser parler en privé ?
C'est bon.
Je reviens...
- Donc, on va devenir partenaires ?
- Où as-tu entendu ça ?
Tu fais tourner le magasin, tu vas avoir
besoin de protection.
Contre qui ?
Jonah est en prison.
Ça n'a rien a voir avec Jonah.
Ne fais pas la même erreur que Gracie.
Je prends mes 50%.
Ou les gens dehors porteront des
fleurs et des cierges sur ta tombe.
OK ?
A demain...
Et après demain.
Et les jours suivants.
Tu tricotes ?
Oui, c'est une des rares choses
qui me changent les idées.
J'ai appris ça en pension à Vassar.
Tu n'as plus envie de moi
maintenant, n'est-ce pas ?
Non c'est juste que...
En fait, c'était à ma mère.
Mon Dieu.
Je suis... Vraiment désolée.
- Je l'ai trouvé dans un carton là-haut.
- C'est bon. - Non, non ,non.
- Je... je vais les remettre.
- Non, non, non. Je pense...
Je pense que tu devrais le terminer.
Non, je n'y arriverai pas.
Écoute, c'est pas grave.
Finalement, je pense que
ma mère t'aurait appréciée.
- Vraiment ?
- Non, pas du tout.
Manley.
- Hein ?
- C'est notre nom pour le magazine.
Mimi et Stanley. Manley.
C'est vraiment le message que
tu veux faire passer ?
Tu as raison. Un point pour toi.
Stimi, c'est mieux.
Papa...
Il faudrait enlever toutes ces affiches.
Que cet endroit revienne à la normale.
Je ne pense pas que tout
redevienne normal un jour.
Oui.
Je, euh...
Je suis désolé.
Moi aussi.
M. le Maire !
C'est Mitchell Cafferty qui l'a fait.
Quoi ?
- Il a tué Gracie.
- De quoi tu parles, Dale ?
Si je refuse de lui donner sa part, il m'a
menacé de me faire pareil qu'à Gracie.
Allons chercher Gray.
Très bien, Jonah.
Debout. Allons-y.
Allons-y.
- Tu m'emmènes où ?
- Tu le sauras quand on y sera.
Gray, tu fais quoi ?
On l'emmène dans un
endroit plus sûr.
Beaucoup de gens veulent le tuer
après ce qu'il a fait.
On ne sait pas ce qu'il a fait.
Il n'a pas été jugé.
Les circonstances sont exceptionnelles,
Johnston.
Nous n'avons pas de juge.
En tant que Maire, j'ai rassemblé un
jury qui l'a déclaré coupable.
Tu as fait quoi ?
Mitch a menacé Dale de lui faire la même
chose qu'à Gracie s'il ne coopérait pas.
Quelqu'un d'autre l'a entendu ?
- Non.
- Ce n'est pas une preuve.
- Tu penses que je mens ?
- Il voulait juste t'intimider.
-  Ça ne veut rien dire.
- C'est incroyable.
Tu te fiches de la vérité.
- Tu veux juste Jonah.
- Je l'ai !
- Il est innocent.
- Il est loin d'être innocent !
Ça fait des années
qu'il rôde dans cette ville !
À partir de maintenant,
les types comme lui dégagent !
On ne fait pas de marché avec eux.
Tu comptes faire quoi, Gray ?
Tu veux le tuer de sang-froid ?
Dire qu'il a tenté de s'échapper pendant
que vous le mettiez en lieu sûr ?
Qui va le faire ?
Bill ?
Tu vas lui mettre une balle dans la tête
quand Gray te dira de le faire ?
Je ne vais tuer personne.
C'est à toi de voir, Gray.
<i>Vas-y.</i>
Non ?
C'est bien ce que tu veux, non ?
Tu décides des règles,
de qui doit vivre ou mourir ?
Vas-y et fais-le.
Mais tu le fais ici, devant moi et Dale.
Devant tout le monde.
Pas... pas dans une pièce au fond
avec tes copains.
Ne laisse pas quelqu'un d'autre
faire le sale boulot.
Tu veux le voir mort ? Alors prends
ce flingue et descends-le.
Gray, non !
Il vaudrait mieux que tu sois tout à fait
sûr qu'il soit coupable. Sinon...
Tu seras un meurtrier,
et justice sera vite faite.
Jonah a accepté de quitter la ville
et de ne plus revenir.
- L'exil.
- Ça a marché pour les Grecs.
La ville est débarrassée
de Jonah Prowse...
et tu as le beau rôle.
Très bien.
- Et Mitchell Cafferty ?
- Laisse-moi m'en occuper.
Écoute... Johnston, j'aime cette ville.
Et je veux qu'on y soit en sécurité,
comme on l'a toujours été.
Ça a toujours été une démocratie.
C'est facile quand tout va bien.
Mais quand les gens ont peur,
ou paniquent...
ça devient beaucoup plus dur.
- Je vais tenter d'y veiller.
- Je crois que nous allons tous le faire.
Mon père, ton grand-père, était un
excellent athlète, tu le savais ?
Dans tous les sports, Sam.
Il a gagné plein de médailles
quand il était à l'école.
Mais, quand j'avais ton âge,
il était dans l'armée de l'air.
Il était souvent absent, et n'a pas eu le
temps de m'apprendre grand-chose, donc...
- Sam, c'est pour ça que je suis
nul au foot.  - Moi aussi.
Désolé, Fiston.
Oui.
Oh, la voilà.
Tu es prêt ?
Tu t'entraînes beaucoup.
Et voilà, entraîneur.
Je suis là.
D'accord ? Je suis là.
Robert !
Hé, ce n'est pas ce que tous les
joueurs de foot font entre eux ?
Tiens, ça va te tenir chaud.
- Emily, quand Chris est né...
- Non.
Quand Chris est né,
tu avais quatre ans.
Ta mère disait qu'elle
voulait faire une pause.
Je traversais une mauvaise passe,
et elle ne voulait pas que Chris
et toi grandissiez là-dedans,
alors je l'ai laissée partir.
Mais je ne le voulais pas.
Elle ne t'a jamais oublié.
Nous nous aimions.
- C'était comme...
- Comme toi et Jake.
Ne rends pas Jake responsable
de la mort de ton frère.
C'est ma faute.
C'est moi qui ai poussé
Chris à faire ce boulot.
Il n'était pas prêt.
Il n'était pas destiné à cette vie.
Jake m'en a voulu.
Je ne l'ai pas compris à l'époque...
mais maintenant oui.
Ce garçon t'aime toujours.
Il n'y a pas de couvre-feu,
ou un truc dans le genre ?
Non.
Génial.
Alors c'est pour ça que tu
réservais ta ration d'énergie.
Chouette musique, Mary.
Je boirais du café froid à la lumière
des bougies toute ma vie,
si je pouvais juste écouter de
la musique de temps en temps.
Tu sais que je t'aime, hein ?
Oui.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Comment ça s'est passé ?
Il est parti.
C'est ce qu'il y a de mieux
pour l'instant.
Oui.
J'imagine qu'il n'y a pas
de cidre ici, non ?
T'as envie de parler ?
Non. C'est plutôt le contraire.
Mary, tu peux nous resservir de...
ce que tu es en train de verser ?
C'est presque comme avant ici.
Comme s'il n'y avait pas eu de bombes.
Restons ici autant que possible, hein ?
Je me suis enfin souvenu
du nom de cette chanson.
Elle était dans le Jukebox de Mary.
Allez.
Allez !
Et Heather ?
Et Roger ?
Tu sais bien...
On devrait se conduire en adultes,
et partir d'ici tout de suite.
Tu as raison.
C'est ce qu'on devrait faire.
- Jake ! Viens voir dehors, maintenant.
- Allons-y.
Ils ont besoin d'aide.
Emmène-les à l'intérieur.
Jake !
Certains d'entre eux étaient en avion,
ils ont atterri au milieu de nulle part.
Ça fait des semaines qu'ils marchent.
Ils ont dû vivre un enfer.
Oh mon Dieu !
Roger.
Qui c'est, merde ?

<i>All right, it looks like</i>
<i>the explosion</i>
came from the west,
maybe Denver.
<i>Maybe one of you</i>
<i>would like to tell me</i>
just exactly who you
think is in charge here.
<i>Gray's finally getting</i>
<i>that election, huh?</i>
Is the mayor nervous?
Not as nervous as he should be.
You're blushing.
It's a reaction
to the iodine, okay?
It's a reaction to having your
shirt off in front of me.
Did you steal
from me, Dale?
After everything
I have done for you?
Everything you've done for me?
You wouldn't have a store
if it wasn't for me.
Where are you going?
To get the
generator.
From Jonah?
Yeah.
Even if you get a generator,
it won't end there.
<i>If you push my father,</i>
<i>Jake,he'll push back.</i>
Mitchell Cafferty,
that is not yours!
Whoa, easy, big fella.
Mitchell and the other guys
don't see our arrangement
the way I do.
<i>Gracie, we've got all</i>
<i>this food out here.</i>
We sure could use
a place to distribute it.
You'd have to stop doing
business with Jonah.
GRACIE:
I'm in.
SAMUEL:
Dad! I need you.
Right now!
Dad!
Hey.
What you got there?
A football.
Yeah, yeah.
I know that.
What's it for?
You have to
teach me to play.
Why?
'Cause I don't know how.
Well, I'm not
sure I know how.
Okay, okay, uh...
I know a little.
Come on.
What, this is something that
has to be done right now?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, what are you doing?
Putting a hand
pump on this well,
so we don't have to waste
generator power for water.
There's really
a well under there?
First well in Jericho,
according to the sign.
I remember another
first that happened right there.
You shouldn't have dared me.
Nobody had to dare you.
Yeah, well, I remember
one of your finer moments.
Right over there,
behind Bailey's.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, let's not
talk about that.
I could get sick right here.
Some people can't hold their
apple wine coolers.
No. No.
You kept singing that
depressing song
by that uh, that bald girl.
Sinead O'Connor,
and that was our song.
Our song?
I never got to vote.
Hey, um, let's-let's talk about
what happened right there.
The day you went to
get medicine for your dad.
Heather kissed you.
She talked to me about it.
Yeah, I-I don't want
her to get hurt.
I have no plans to do that.
Mrs. Leigh?
Mrs. Leigh!
Mrs. Leigh.
Oh, Gracie!
(sobbing):
No!
Dad.
Do we know who did this?
No witnesses.
She was already gone
by the time Dale found her.
Sure Dale didn't kill her?
The blood on the floor
has been drying for a long time.
And that boy is incapable
of doing something like that.
Nobody is incapable
under the right circumstances.
JIMMY:
Mayor Green, Mitchell Cafferty
has something to tell you.
What the hell...
You back off!
Easy.
Jonah said he killed her,
but I didn't believe him.
Jonah Prowse
said he did this?
Jonah showed up at the compound,
and his arm was all torn up.
He said that he killed Gracie
because she wouldn't do
business with him anymore.
He was trying to prove to me
and the rest of the guys
that he was
still in charge.
Where's Jonah now?
I don't know.
He hit me with
a tire iron,
I just saw
him driving off.
You believe this guy, Johnston?
He broke out of our jail.
He's a fugitive.
Listen, I wouldn't blame you
if you locked me up right now.
But if you want any help
tracking down Jonah,
I'm ready.
Eric, why don't you
talk to Mitch here?
See if he can help.
Let's go.
This guy is a
criminal, Johnston.
Yeah, I know what he is.
I'm trying to figure
out what he knows.
We can arrest him anytime.
We just had our first
murder in 30 years.
And I've been mayor of this
town for 25 of those years!
Maybe that's the problem.
You still think Jericho's
the same sweet little town,
it was before the bombs.
We need somebody
who understands...
Save it for
the election, Gray.
This is what the
election is about!
You want to get this civilian
off the crime scene?
Just tell me the
name of the song.
If you don't remember,
I'm not telling you.
I remember it was
sad and depressing.
You must not remember
our relationship.
It's a great house.
Yeah, thanks.
The first one Roger
and I looked at.
We made an offer immediately.
Well, when you know what
you want, why keep looking?
Thanks for walking me home.
Thanks for helping
with the well.
Bye.
Shh!
Shh-shh-shh.
Don't say a word.

I just heard.
I'm so sorry, Dale.
The only lead we have
to go on right now
is that Mitchell Cafferty
said Jonah confessed.
Mitch is not much of a witness.
I was there yesterday,
when Gracie stood up to Jonah.
She said she wasn't going to
do business with him anymore.
He couldn't have been
too happy about that.
All right. We need to pull a
couple of guys off of patrol
and go find them.
If Jonah did this,
 he is not going to come in willingly.
I'm coming, too.
No, Dale.
I know how to shoot a gun.
Son, the last thing you need
to be doing right now
is waving a gun around at the
man you think killed Gracie.
He did it.
You said yourself she stood up
to Jonah, and now she's dead.
You're not going, Dale.
There's something that
I have to talk to you about.
Gray's going to use this
for all it's worth, Dad.
A lot of people are starting to listen to him.
Well,you listen to me.
I've known Gracie all my life.
We're going to find
the man who did this.
We're going to bring
him to justice.
And I do not want
to hear another word
about this election.
Yes, sir.
Any news on Jonah?
No, no one in here has seen him.
Jonah better hope that
Gray doesn't find him.
He says he's going to make
an example out of him.
What's he going to do,
string him up?
You can't kill someone in
the middle of Main Street.
Yeah?
Tell that to Gracie Leigh.
Gray came back from
Topeka a changed man.
He's not messing around.
And I, for one, think
he's got the right idea.
W-wait a minute.
You're not voting
for Gray Anderson?
I'm not going to answer that.
This is still America.
Yeah, just barely.
MIMI:
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Okay, that was good.
Um... let's try again.
What was good
about that?
I don't know.
Just pick up
the ball.
Why can't you throw it
to somebody else
when they're chasing you?
I don't know what you mean.
When they're chasing you.
When who is
chasing who, son?
The guys
that want the ball.
God, why do you suck at this?
Hey, you got
to watch your mouth.
Hey, it's too cold for you to be
out here playing
without jackets.
How's it going?
Not so well.
I need to get back to work.
Son, the trick is
the grip,
all right?
Put your little finger
and your ring finger...
no, this one.
Yeah, it should go
on the white stripe.
Thumb goes
underneath it.
Okay? And just go...
just-just throw
it to me.
Okay?
All right.
There's nothing
wrong with that.
Hey, I thought basketball
was your game.
They're kind of all my games.
Hey, Jake.
Need your help.
I'll be right there.
So, where we going?
Jonah's compound.
My dad and Eric
are meeting us there.
You think he's still out there.
I think he doesn't have
a lot of places to hide
or a lot of people
to turn to.
Well, he must have some other
friends in town or maybe family.
Hold on.
What if they can't find him?
He can't just get away
with this.
They'll find him.
What am I supposed to do?
Sit down, Dale.
There's some things
you need to know.
Come on.
After the bombs
went off and
your mother died,
Gracie changed her will.
She left her store to you.
I was the witness.
The papers are in a locked box
at the bank along with the keys.
Nobody expects a 16-year-old boy
to run that business.
You need to take
some time
and think about what
you're going to do
with all this.
I'll be there if you need me.
I can't take her store.
I quit.
I called her a liar.
I said the worst things...
That happens in families.
People get mad,
say things.
But that doesn't erase
everything that came before.
Gracie loved you.
And she wanted you
to have her store.
Come on, guys,
check around back.
Whoa, whoa, what
are you doing, Gray?
Manhunt, same as you.
Got to thinking that
Jonah might be coming
to Emily for sympathy.
We can handle this.
Yeah? Who's that?
Those of us who have been
training to protect this town.
You're doing a hell
of a job.
This is dangerous, Gray.
We can't just have a bunch of
vigilantes running around town.
It's a little late for that.
I've seen two other
truckloads of guys
running around
this neighborhood.
The town is heading
towards chaos.
It's not going to calm down till
somebody finds Jonah Prowse.
What's going on?
We're looking for Jonah Prowse.
He killed Gracie Leigh.
Since he's your father...
Not in any way that matters.
Well, we'd like to look
around a little bit.
No.
She wouldn't hide him, Gray.
We're going to look around
a little bit
and then we'll be gone.
Hey.
There's no sign of him
in the backyard.
That's good news.
Come on, I'll patrol
with you for a while.
Let's go, Gray.
Watch this house.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Where is he?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You didn't even blink when
you heard about Gracie.
Where is he?
Jake...
I didn't kill Gracie Leigh.
Then why are you holding
us at gunpoint?
'Cause maybe
you won't believe me.
Maybe you'll try
and be some kind of hero
and take me in.
He's bleeding.
He needs a doctor, Jake.
JONAH:
I'm not going
into town.
Jake, you're going to help
me get out of here.
I'm not helping you
do anything.
For all I know,
you're a murderer.
I didn't do it!
I walked out this morning--
found myself surrounded
by my own men.
Mitchell Cafferty's there.
He tells me Gracie Leigh's
been murdered.
When I asked him who did it,
Mitchell says to me, "You did.
And I saw the whole thing."
Before
I knew it,
he's got a knife on me.
And he sliced my arm open.
But I took a crowbar to him
before he could finish the job.
Your guys sided
with Mitch?
It didn't sit too well with them
that my little girl
stole our haul
from the food drop
and I stopped Mitchell Cafferty
from putting a bullet
in her brain.
So they did this to you
because you wouldn't kill me?
Okay, okay, okay.
Get him up.
(groans)
We got to take him in.
But we got to be careful.
There are a lot
of people out there
who would rather shoot first
and ask questions later.
Mitchell will keep coming
until he kills me.
We'll take him
to Town Hall.
You'll be safe there.
Those guys will walk
right in that jail...
and kill me and anyone else
who gets in their...
What'd you come here for, huh?
You put your own
daughter at risk...
Shut up!
Just get him... just get him
a doctor.
Okay, okay
Dale.
Hey.
What happened?
She was murdered... stabbed.
Dale...
Dale!
I just heard.
SEAN:
You the one
who found her?
Yeah.
Open the place up.
Let's have some fun.
Back off, Sean.
What do you care?
It's not your store.
Yeah, it is.
All of it.
What are you talking about?
Gracie gave it to me.
Worked out for you
then, huh?
Dale...
Stop it.
You're lucky I don't
take you out right here.
SKYLAR:
Get out of here, Sean.
Sean, you all right?
Come on, get out.
See you around?
Hey.
Did you find
the guy?
No, no, not yet.
Um, look, I got
to check on something
in the basement,
and then I'm going back
out there with Gray
and his men...
Between that basement
and all the men with guns...
Hey.
What's wrong?
Robert, is this what we have
to look forward to?
People showing up,
you grabbing that damn gun
and running off?
It's not all that different
than before.
Yeah, that worked out so well
for us, didn't it?
So when are we going
to lose you?
Lose me?
I don't know that you are.
The kids are getting used
to having you here.
Yeah?
What about you, D?
Me, too.
I don't want to go anywhere.
I like being here.
You lock the basement--
or you tell those
men to fight their own
battles and stay home.
The damn world ended.
Can't you just be with us?
Kenchy, I need you
to come with me.
Where?
I'll tell you on the
way to the medical
center, all right?
Look, we need some supplies.
Oh... you want me
to kill someone?
You need a real doctor,
my friend.
A real doctor wouldn't do
what I need done.
Come on.
Let's go.
How bad is it?
Well, whoever did this
used a serrated edge.
We could have done
without that.
Did you stop the bleeding?
Mostly.
I gave him a shot
for the pain.
Probably fall asleep now.
Is this the guy?
The murderer everybody's
talking about?
He says no.
Oh, no one's going
to believe him.
They're
out for blood.
He's not going to get
a fair shake.
Yes, he will.
I'll go get my dad.
He can bring him in, make sure
things are done the right way.
It's Jonah's only chance.
Okay.
All right.
Lock the door.
Mind if I wash
my hands?
We're not safe.
Gracie's death makes
that all too clear.
I tell you what, Mary.
The chaos I saw when I was
fighting my way back home
to Jericho, well now,
it's right here
on our Main Street.
Criminals like Jonah Prowse
think we're easy targets now.
Well, I'll tell
you what, Neil.
I think we should go
find Jonah Prowse
and make an example of him.
And he shouldn't get
to sit around for 15 years
before he gets
what's coming to him.
We got to send
a message.
(murmured assent)
Crime will
not be tolerated.
We are willing
to do whatever it takes
to keep Jericho safe.
So please remember
at the polls tomorrow...
Dad, I need your help.
...to vote Gray Anderson
for a new Jericho.
Watch it.
Sorry about that, Ma.
Oh, no, no.
We are not doing that.
Come on, now.
You can call me Pa.
Seriously, that
really creeps me out.
Good creepy
or bad creepy?
What?
Look.
What we did...
it's not what you think.
I had a weak moment.
It was a mistake.
Well, I'm really good
at making mistakes.
Yes, you are.
Believe me, it was
a pleasant surprise,
but we can't
do this anymore.
Because of Bonnie?
Yeah, I'll talk to her.
She'll be fine.
Do you know how many
second dates I've had
in the last
five years?
I'm guessing not many.
And do you know why?
Yeah, because you're obnoxious
and demanding and
totally self-absorbed.
Yeah.
And you are sweet, simple
and bull-headed.
You can't handle
someone like me.
This will never work.
Ah, that's what they said
about Brangelina.
Are you seriously quoting
<i>Us</i> magazine right now?
Yeah, what do you think
they'd call us?
Stimiley?
Mimiley?
St...
Stimi.
You are such an idiot.
You're harboring
a criminal, Jake.
He's hurt.
And he needed a doctor,
so I got one,
and then I came to you.
Well, we have got us one
hell of a problem, Jake,
because if anyone knows
that you've been hiding
Jonah Prowse
while the whole town
has been out looking for him,
they'll throw us all in jail.
Jonah says Mitchell
killed Gracie
and then he
set him up.
What do you think?
He might be telling the truth.
You're not a judge or a jury.
Now, we're gonna go get him,
we're gonna bring him in...
Good, that's what
I came here for!
Well, you better hope...
He's gone.
Let's get him!
Come on!
That's him!
Let's get him!
Well, well...
Jonah Prowse.
Can't get away
from us, huh?
Pick him up!
Get him up, guys.
All right, let's go.
Get out of the truck.
Do you solemnly swear
to uphold the laws
of the State of Kansas
and faithfully discharge
the duties of Mayor?
I do.
Congratulations.
Friends, thank you for
placing your trust in me
to lead Jericho
through this difficult time.
This town belongs
to all of us
and we must work
together to survive.
The resources of this town
also belong to all of us,
and therefore, as my first
official act as Mayor,
I am ordering the food
from the food drop
to be distributed immediately.
And now,
to the subject of security.
One of our citizens
was brutally murdered.
But her murderer will be
held to account.
Justice will be swift and sure,
you have my word.
Don't take that too serious.
They're not calling for
your head on a platter.
Why'd you run?
My father was going
to bring you in...
Your father just got
shown the door, Jake.
I didn't want this
to happen.
Jonah made his own bed.
I'm sorry your dad
lost the election.
I feel if I hadn't
gotten you involved...
No.
The people spoke, and they got
exactly what they wanted.
What do you want,
Mitchell?
Just visiting.
Hey, sweetie?
Do you mind giving me
and my man here
a little privacy?
It's okay.
I'll be back in a second.
So I hear you and I are
going to be partners now.
Where'd you get that?
Well, you're running the store,
you're gonna need protection.
From who?
Jonah's in jail.
This has nothing
to do with Jonah.
Don't make the same
mistake that Gracie made.
I get half the cut.
Or those people out there
are going to be putting
flowers and candles on
the sidewalk for you.
Okay?
See you tomorrow...
and the next day.
And the next day.
Are you knitting?
Yeah, it's one of the few things
that ever just zoned me out.
I learned in
the dorm at Vassar.
Not so hot for me now, are you?
No, it's just, um...
Actually, I think that
belonged to my mother.
Oh, my God.
I am... so sorry.
I found it half finished
in a trunk upstairs.
It's okay.
No, no, no.
I'll-I'll put it back.
No, no, no.
I think...
I think you should finish it.
No, I couldn't.
Look, it's okay.
I actually think my mother
would have liked you.
Really?
No, not at all.
Manley.
Our tabloid name.
Mimi and Stanley. Manley.
Is that <i>really</i> the message you
want to be putting out there?
You're right.
Good point.
Stimi's better.
Dad...
We're going
to have to...
take down all
these posters.
Get this place
back to normal.
I don't think normal's
where we're headed.
(chuckles):
Yeah.
I, uh...
I'm sorry.
So am I.
DALE:
Mayor!
Mitchell Cafferty did it.
What?
He killed Gracie.
What are you
talking about, Dale?
He said if I
refuse to give him a cut of the
store, he'd do to me
what he did to Gracie.
Let's find Gray.
All right, Jonah.
Get up. Let's go.
Let's go.
Where you taking me?
You'll find out
when we get there.
JOHNSTON:
Gray, what
are you doing?
We're moving him to
a more secure location.
There's a lot of folks
who want to rip him
apart after what he did.
We don't know what he did.
He hasn't had a trial yet.
Well, these are special
circumstances, Johnston.
We don't have a judge.
As mayor, I formed
a tribunal, and
he was found guilty.
You did what?
Mitch just told Dale that
he would do to him
what he did to Gracie
if he didn't go along with him.
Well, did anyone else
hear him say that?
No.
That's hardly proof.
What? You think I'm
lying? I'm not lying.
GRAY: He was trying
to intimidate you.
It doesn't mean
he actually did it.
JAKE:
This is unbelievable.
You don't even care
who killed her.
You just want Jonah.
I've got Jonah!
He's innocent.
He's far
from innocent!
He's been preying on
this town for years!
From now on,
guys like him
go away! We don't coddle them,
we don't make deals with them.
JAKE:
What are you planning
on doing, Gray?
You going to kl him
in cold blood?
Say he tried to escape
while moving him to
a secure location?
Who's going to do it?
Bill?
You gonna
put a bullet
in Jonah's head when Gray
tells you to?
I'm not shooting anybody.
It's up to you, Gray.
Go on.
No?
This is what you want,right?
You make the rules?
Decide who lives and dies?
Go ahead
and do it.
But you do it here,
in front of me and Dale.
In front of everyone.
Not... not in some
back room with your buddies.
Don't let someone else do
the dirty work for you, Mayor.
You want him dead?
You take this gun
and blow his
brains out.
Gray, no.
You better
be damn sure he's guilty.
Because if he's not,
you're a murderer,
and justice
will be swift.
HNSTON:
<i>Jonah agrees to leave town</i>
and not come back.
Exile.
Worked for the Greeks.
The town gets
rid of Jonah Prowse,
and you get to save face.
All right.
Now, what about Mitchell
Cafferty?
Why don't you
let me handle that?
Look, um... Johnston,
I love this town.
I just want to keep it safe.
Like it always was.
What it always was
is a democracy.
That's easy when things
are going all right.
But when you're scared or mad,
it gets to be a lot harder.
I'll try to watch
out for that.
Oh, I think
we'll all be watching.
You know, my father--
your grandfather--
he was a... he was
an excellent athlete.
You know?
I mean, all sports, Sam.
He won lots of awards
when he was in school.
But the thing is,
when I was
your age,
he was in the Air Force,
and he was gone a lot,
and he didn't have time
to teach me much, so...
Sam, that's why
I suck at football.
Me, too.
I'm sorry about that, son.
Yeah.
Oh, here she comes.
Come on. Okay?
Come on.
Ready?
Hut!
You practice hard.
There you go, Coach.
Hey, hey.
I'm here.
Okay? Right here.
Robert!
Hey, isn't that what
football players do
to each other?
This will keep you warm.
Emily, when
Chris was born...
Don't.
When Chris was born,
you were four years old.
Your mother said she
wanted a clean break.
I was into
some bad stuff,
and she didn't
want you and Chris
growing up in it,
so I let her go.
But I didn't want to.
She never got over you.
We loved each other.
It was like...
Like you and Jake.
Don't blame Jake for
your brother's death.
That's on me.
I pushed Chris
to do that job.
He wasn't ready. He wasn't
cut out for that kind of life.
Jake wanted out.
I didn't understand
that then,
but I sure do now.
That boy still loves you.
Don't you have a
curfew or something?
No.
Cool.
So this is what
you've been saving
your generator
rations for.
Nice music, Mary.
I'll have cold coffee
and candles the rest of my life
if I can just have
music now and then.
You know
I love you, right?
Yes.
Hey.
Hey.
How did it go?
He's gone.
It's the best thing for now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You don't suppose they have any
of those apple wine coolers
back there, do you?
Feel like talking, huh?
No. Just the opposite.
Hey, Mary,
can we get
two more of whatever
it is you're pouring?
It almost looks
normal in here.
Like the bombs
never even happened.
Let's stay in here
as long as we can, huh?
* It's been seven hours
and 15 days... *
Finally remembered
the name of that song.
Mary had it
on the jukebox.
* Since you been gone *
Come on.
Come on!
* I can do whatever I want *
* I can see whoever I choose *
* I can eat my dinner
in a fancy restaurant *
* But nothing *
* I said, nothing
can take away these blues *
* 'Cause nothing compares *
* Nothing compares to you... *
What about Heather?
What about Roger?
You know how this goes.
We should be grown-ups,
and walk away right now.
You're right.
We should.
* Like a bird without a song *
* I know that living with you,
baby, was sometimes hard *
* But I'm willing
to give it another try... *
ERIC:
Jake!
Jake, we got
to go outside. Now!
Let's go.
* Nothing compares... *
They need help.
Take them inside.
Jake!
Some of them were
on planes that landed
in the middle
of nowhere.
They've been
walking for weeks.
They must have
gone through hell.
Oh, my God!
Roger.
Who the hell is that?

- Hť, papa, t'as un moment ?
- Nan.
USA Today organise un concours
pour ťlire 5 villes de moins

Je pensais qu'on pourrait
proposer Jericho.
Pourquoi ? Pour que des investisseurs
commencent ŗ racheter la ville,
et transformer Main Street
en centre commercial
avec une demi-douzaine
de coffee-shop ?
Papa, il y a bien pire que

Le genre de gros titre qui pourrait
attirer les ťlecteurs le mois prochain.
Fiston, peu m'importe
de battre Gray Anderson.
Les gens de cette ville votent
pour moi depuis 20 ans.
J'obtiendrai leurs voix
en faisant le boulot
pour lequel ils m'ont ťlu.
Qu'est-ce que vous
faites ici, les filles ?
Ton pŤre n'est pas allť
faire son checkup ce matin.
Et April a ťtť assez gentille
pour prendre sur sa pause de midi...
et faire une visite ŗ domicile.
Dťsolť, Doc, mais il va falloir
reporter Áa aprŤs les ťlections.
Johnston !
Tu vas faire ce check-up,
que tu le veuilles ou non.
J'ai attrapť froid,
et Áa fait une semaine que tu
ne te sens pas trŤs bien.
C'est une mauvaise grippe.
La moitiť de mon ťquipe
a ťtť touchťe.
Tu veux te dťshabiller ici...
ou tu prťfŤres le faire dans
un endroit plus intime ?
Dans mon bureau.
Voilŗ mon homme !
Comment Áa s'est passť ?
Et bien, Freddy... merci pour
ta cravate porte-bonheur.
"Recherche chauffeur avec
expťrience militaire.
Possibilitťs de voyager."
Mon petit doigt me dit que
ce ne sera pas aux Bahamas.
J'ai besoin de bosser.
T'es pas chauffeur, mec.
T'es pilote, et un sacrť bon mÍme.
En ce moment, je suis
surtout fauchť.
ņ moins que tu ne veuilles
payer mon loyer.
Pardon ?
Par contre, ce que je peux faire...
C'est te payer un verre.
Ohť ! Mira !
Sers-nous deux biŤres.
Et les bonnes maniŤres ?
J'espŤre que tu ne m'as pas sifflťe
comme un chien.
- Oh, chťrie...
- Pas de "chťrie", chťri.
T'es trop radin en pourboires.
Et cette alliance ŗ ton doigt,
elle compte pas ?
T'as fini par te passer
la corde au cou, Freddy ?
- Bravo.
- Merci mon pote.
Hť, elle a des soeurs pas mal.
ņ moins que tu sois toujours accro
ŗ cette fermiŤre dans l'Iowa.
- Au Kansas.
- C'est pareil.
Non, c'est pas pareil.
Ouais. Attends.
Reste ici, d'accord ?
Oý tu veux que j'aille ?

<i>Chercher mes enfants.</i>
<i>Robert, on n'a pas le temps.</i>
Robert !
Anna.
- Fťlicitations.
- Merci.
C'est un bon gars.
Je ne sais pas ŗ quel point, mais...
il a promis de veiller sur moi.
- C'est de la folie, mais je le crois.
- C'est quoi Áa ?
Mon tťmoin qui drague ma fiancťe ?
Tťmoin ?
Il te faut une demande en rŤgle ?
Tu es plus un frŤre pour moi que
celui avec lequel j'ai grandi.
Pas de problŤme.
«a me fait plaisir.
Moi aussi, j'ai de bonnes nouvelles.
Euh, mon coeur, tu veux bien...
nous laisser seuls un moment ?
Et si je te disais que j'ai rťussi
ŗ trouver un petit boulot ?
8 semaines,
100 000$, cash.
Quelle sorte de boulot ?
Le genre qu'on connaÓt bien.
Du fret.
Vite fait, bien fait.
30 000$ d'avance,
70 000$ ŗ l'arrivťe.
Oý Áa ?
En Afghanistan.
- Non.
- Allez.
«a fait combien de temps que tu
cherches ? 6 mois ?
On fait ce boulot-lŗ,
et aprŤs on est pťnards.
Tu pourras ouvrir une ťcole
de pilotage, rentrer chez toi,
revoir cette fille !
- Pourquoi tu me fais Áa ?
Comment peux-tu
me demander Áa
aprŤs ce qu'on a vu lŗ-bas,
ce qu'on a fait.
Tout ce qu'on a fait, c'est
rester en vie, J.
Des innocents sont morts, Freddy.
Des personnes innocentes.
Je les vois dŤs que
je ferme les yeux.
Ce qui est dťjŗ assez
rare ces temps-ci.
Et bien, cette fois-ci on
sera plus malins, mec.
Tu sais que je te
couvrirai, mec.
Je suis dťsolť.
Tu vas devoir te dťbrouiller tout seul
cette fois. Je ne peux pas y retourner.
Tu sais quoi, Jerry,
si tu acceptes un face ŗ face,
je t'en ferai baver
au stade de Wrigley.
Sťrieux.
Je le jure sur une boÓte de cookies.
Gťnial.
ņ 6 heures ŗ la salle
d'entraÓnement.
On se voit lŗ-bas.
Encore Chicago ?
Hť Prof, c'est la pause dťjeuner ?
Tu veux m'aider ŗ prťparer
mon programme ou...
ŗ corriger 30 dissertations sur
La Ferme des Animaux d'Orwell ?
Non, j'ai une meilleure idťe.
DťlŤgue ce boulot
et suis-moi ŗ Chicago ce soir.
«a ferait bonne impression
face ŗ mes ťlŤves.
Je t'ťcrirai un mot d'excuse.
"Chers enfants, dťsolťe,
il n'y aura pas classe aujourd'hui.
Je suis en train de m'enfiler
des biŤres avec mon fiancť...
et de me laisser aller aux
plaisirs du sexe ŗ Chicago."
Chicago est plus connu
pour ses pizzas, non ?!
Pour Áa aussi.
Une nuit.
Tes ťlŤves rattraperont.
C'est bon.
Sťrieusement ?
Tu vas pas essayer de
me dissuader, si ?
Non, non, non,
assez parlť.
<i>46 plaquages, trois sacs</i>
<i>et quelques interceptions...</i>
«a va ?
Je m'inquiŤte pour Freddy.
Tu veux une biŤre ?
Non.
Je pense que quelque
chose le tracasse.
De quoi tu parles ?
Ces types lui tournent autour.
Comme...
des soldats, mais ils ne le sont pas.
Ils sont arrivťs aprŤs ton dťpart.
Et alors, c'est un grand garÁon.
Il traine avec qui il veut.
C'est pas Áa.
En rentrant, Freddy
avait un cocard,
il a dit qu'il partait deux mois,
qu'il fallait pas le chercher.
Demande-lui de rester.
Tu crois que j'ai pas essayť ?
Il m'a dit qu'il n'avait pas le choix,
qu'il faisait Áa pour moi.
Que veux-tu que j'y fasse ?
Aide-le.
Rejoins-le.
Je sais ce qu'il a fait
pour toi en Irak.
Je sais que tu lui dois la vie.
Ouais.
«a n'a plus l'air
trŤs important maintenant...
Je suis enceinte, Jake.
Je...
J'ai un mauvais pressentiment.
- Robert, que...
- Ne crie pas.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais lŗ ?
Tu dois me suivre.
…coute, me dis pas
ce que je dois faire.
Tu ne dois pas nous approcher
ŗ moins de 150 mŤtres.
Les circonstances ont changť, Darcy.
<i>Maman!</i>
<i>Maman.</i>
Mon Dieu. Les enfants.
Dťverrouille de l'intťrieur.
Alison, Áa va aller.
Laisse-les sortir, Robert,
ou je me mets ŗ hurler.
Non, ťcoute-moi attentivement.
Dans cinq secondes,
je monte dans ce camion
et je quitte Washington
pour de bon.
Et je ne suis pas venu
pour en discuter avec toi.
Maintenant tu peux me croire,
et venir avec nous
ou alors rester ici.
Mais tu ne reverras jamais tes enfants.
30 HEURES AVANT LES BOMBES
Hť mon pote,
t'es de la partie ?
Ouais.
Content que t'aies changť d'avis.
Je te le dis,
une opportunitť comme Áa,
Áa n'arrive qu'une fois.
Pourtant, c'est pas la premiŤre fois
que je t'entends dire Áa.
Fais-moi plaisir.
Projette-toi de quelques mois.
Imagine-toi sur...
une plage Mexicaine,
entourť de bikinis
et de billets de 100$.
J'essaie de ne pas
me projeter si loin.
«a m'aide ŗ relativiser
quand tout part en vrille.
Mon pŤre m'a dit une fois,
si tu ne gardes pas un
oeil sur ton objectif,
tu ne l'atteindras jamais.
En parlant d'oeil...
Tu devrais voir l'autre type.
Bien, prťsente-le-moi.
On bosse pour qui, Freddy?
T'occupe pas.
Ils te connaissent, de rťputation.
Je ne vais nulle part
avant de savoir.
C'est une branche de Ravenwood.
Tu les verras demain,
avant de monter dans l'avion.
En attendant,
tout ce dont tu dois te prťoccuper...
c'est Áa.
Le triple t'attend...
quand tout sera fini.
On doit simplement
conduire le convoi ŗ travers
les lignes ennemies sans se faire tuer.
Combien de fois je dois te sauver les
fesses pour que t'y penses plus, hein ?
<i>DEMANDE DE DIVORCE</i>
<i>DEMANDE DE DIVORCE

<i>Il frappe, la balle s'envole trŤs loin.</i>
<i>Il court, il y est !</i>
Mary Bailey, tu me dois 5$ !
Paie-moi !
J'ai mieux, j'ai mieux.
Apporte donc, euh,
un verre ŗ ma charmante
compagne, c'est pour moi.
Ne gaspillez pas votre argent,
c'est couvert par les frais.
Quel est votre meilleur vin ?
La biŤre.
Vodka, avec glace.
Vous saviez qu'il faut
3 heures de taxi pour venir
de l'aťroport ŗ cette maudite ville ?
Mais c'est pittoresque, non ?
Si on aime le maÔs, oui.
Mais enfin, qui n'aime pas le maÔs ?
Je veux dire il y a,
le maÔs en ťpi,
les cornflakes, le maÔs frit,
la saucisse au maÔs,
le maÔs en tube.
Le maÔs en tube ?
C'est une blague, Melle.
Vous pouvez arrÍter de
me parler, s'il vous plait !
Merci.
- MaÔs, maÔs grillť ?
- Sťrieusement.
Oubliez-moi.
Bailey's.
<i>Salut toi.</i>
Salut.
Je vais te voir cette semaine ?
<i>Et bien, tu peux
me voir tout de suite.</i>
<i>Retourne-toi.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?</i>
Tu n'as pas idťe
<i>ŗ quel point j'ai envie
de t'embrasser lŗ.</i>
Et bien.
<i>Pourquoi tu ne viendrais
pas dans mon bureau ?</i>
Mais qu'est-ce que...
tu m'as mis lŗ-dedans ?
Le moment est venu pour
certains changements, Johnston,
en commenÁant par ton alimentation.
Un homme ne peut pas vivre avec Áa.
Il pourra s'il veut rester
mariť avec moi.
Ta tension ťtait beaucoup trop
ťlevťe lors de ton dernier examen.
C'est le stress. Elle est toujours
ťlevťe en pťriode d'ťlections.
Alors, retire-toi de la course.
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'arrive ?
Quelque chose m'est arrivť
en regardant April t'examiner.
Je me suis posť des questions.
Combien d'annťes nous
reste-t-il ŗ vivre ensemble ?
Elle t'a dit quelque chose ?
Car elle m'a dit que
c'ťtait qu'un coup de froid.
Non,
ce n'est pas ŗ propos
de ta santť ou de la mienne.
Quand tu es rentrť en fonction,
tu as fait deux promesses.
Une aux gens de cette ville,
et l'autre ŗ moi.
Tu te rappelles ce que tu as dit ?
Oui.
Que le travail ne passerait
jamais avant ma famille.
Je te demande juste
de trouver un ťquilibre.
J'ai compris, chťrie.
Restez lŗ.
Maman, fais quelque chose.
Robert, laisse-nous partir.
Je t'en supplie.
Je reviens dans cinq minutes.
- Et aprŤs?
- Et aprŤs...
on quitte la ville.
T'es fou, je ne pars
nulle part avec toi.
Papa, arrÍte. Papa !
L‚che-la, Robert !
…coute-moi, d'accord ?
Je ne te ferai jamais de mal,
ni ŗ ta mŤre, ni ŗ ton frŤre.
Tu me crois ?
Est-ce que tu me crois ?
Je te connais ŗ peine.
…coute, Robert,
tu effraies Samuel.
Rassure-le, Darcy.
Tu as ton portable ?
Non, il l'a pris quand il m'a attrapťe.
Pas le mien.
Vraiment ?
Oý est-il, chťri ?
Dans mon sac ŗ dos.
<i>911. Quel est votre problŤme ?</i>
La porte ťtait ouverte.
J'adore l'amťnagement de la piŤce.
Que voulez-vous, Agent Hicks ?
Devinez quel nom est apparu
sur la liste des passagers
d'un vol international ?
J'ai plus le droit de
prendre l'avion, maintenant ?
Non, pas encore, mais...
Je pensais que, peut-Ítre...
On pourrait conclure un accord.
Vous Ítes sur le point de vous allier
avec des gens peu frťquentables, Jake.
Heureusement pour vous,
votre timing est parfait.
On cherche ŗ coincer Ravenwood.
Pourquoi Áa ?
Ils font de la contrebande d'armes
depuis le dťbut de la guerre.
Ils vendraient des armes ŗ
n'importe qui, mÍme ŗ nos ennemis.
On a besoin d'un complice
qui puisse paraÓtre crťdible.
Et pourquoi j'accepterais ?
Parce que...
... vous savez bien
de quoi ils sont capables.
Sarah, allez, on n'a pas...
Sarah ?
Ne bougez plus.
L‚chez la malette.
Avancez lentement vers moi.
Les mains en l'air...
Tout de suite !
C'est votre camion ?
Il est louť.
Je dťmťnage.
Quel est le problŤme ?
Ouvrez la porte arriŤre.
D'accord.
Qu'est-ce que...
Menotte-le.
Les mains derriŤre le dos.
A l'aide ! Ouvrez la porte.
S'il vous plait.
On va vous sortir de lŗ.
- Vous pouvez ouvrir la porte ?
- Non !
Pouvez-vous ouvrir ?
Attention !
Salut Papa.
- Salut Eric.
- Mary.
Chťrie, tu peux lui apporter une biŤre ?
Bien sŻr.
Merci.
24 HEURES AVANT LES BOMBES
Alors, euh...
Pourquoi je t'ai fait venir ?
Ouais. Tout va bien ?
Ta mŤre et moi avons...
discutť de notre avenir.
Pour Ítre plus prťcis, elle...
a soulignť le fait que je ne semblais
pas prÍt ŗ tourner la page.
C'est du Maman tout crachť.
Quand j'ai pris ce travail,
t'ťtais en... quoi ? CE2 ?
CE1.
On a gagnť le trophťe
de football cette annťe-lŗ.
J'ai inscrit deux touchdowns
pendant la finale.
«a date, c'est dur de se rappeler.
Peut-Ítre parce que
t'ťtais pas au match, Papa.
C'est vrai.
Bref,
ta mŤre a peur que si je...
continue comme Áa,
on va finir par manquer
bien plus que des matchs de foot.
J'y ai rťflťchi,
et j'aimerais te poser une question.
Si je laissais tomber
la course aux ťlections,
est-ce que tu prendrais ma place ?
Quoi ?
Tu ferais un bon candidat, fiston.
T'as toujours vťcu ici,
t'as une vie saine,
pas comme ton frŤre Jake.
De plus, ťgoÔstement, je pourrais...
lever le pied et nťanmoins, garder une
influence sur ce qu'il se passe.
T'es sťrieux ?
Et bien, tu...
T'es intelligent, directif.
T'as mÍme un diplŰme de droit.
Que j'ai l'intention d'utiliser un jour.
Comme beaucoup d'autres choses.
Rien dont tu m'aies parlť.
DÓtes-moi s'il vous faut autre chose.
Rťflťchis-y cette nuit.
Parles-en ŗ April.
«a la concerne aussi.
- Quoi de neuf ?
- Faut qu'on parle.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Ce qu'on transporte pour Ravenwood,
tu sais ce que c'est ?
Je pose pas ce genre de questions, mec.
Des missiles Stinger.
Des lance-roquettes.
C'est pas comme si
c'ťtait une mission humanitaire.
Ils les vendent aux rebelles, Freddy.
Ils serviront ŗ tuer
nos propres hommes !
Les fťdťraux sont sur le coup.
Ils veulent qu'on les aide
ŗ dťmanteler Ravenwood.
T'es malade ?
On n'a pas le choix.
Ils nous surveillent.
Ravenwood aussi, mec.
Ils me font plus peur
que le gouvernement.
Si on marche pas avec les fťdťraux,
ils s'arrangeront pour que
Ravenwood croit que c'est le cas.
- T'as ton argent sur toi ?
- Quoi ?
- Ton argent.
- Ouais, pas loin.
Va chercher Anna, des affaires,
on se voit dans une heure.
- Et ensuite ?
- On dťcolle ce soir.
S'ils nous poursuivent,
au moins, on aura de l'avance.
D'accord ?
Il vaudrait mieux que
personne de l'ťcole ne nous voit.
«a serait difficile de prendre l'avion
et de prťtendre Ítre malade demain.
Tu sais, ŗ Chicago,
tu pourrais marcher des kms
sans rencontrer
quelqu'un que tu connais.
Vraiment ? Encore Chicago ?
En plus, il y a les pizzas,
les Cubs, la culture...
Oý veux-tu en venir ?
Je dois te dire quelque chose.
C'est pas un simple rendez-vous demain.
C'est une entrevue pour
firme d'actionnaires.
Ultime entrevue, en fait.
T'es sťrieux ?
J'ai pensť que tu pourrais
en profiter pour visiter la ville.
Tu vas adorer.
T'es qu'un con.
Emily, on pourrait au moins en parler.
On en a dťjŗ parlť.
C'est pas le genre d'opportunitť
ŗ laquelle on peut dire non.
Vraiment ?
Non.
Tu vois. C'est pas si difficile.
J'arrive pas ŗ y croire.
On doit se marier dans quelques mois.
Pourquoi crois-tu que je fais Áa ?
Parce que t'es ťgoÔste,
et que t'ťcoutes rien.
Ne pas dťmťnager ťtait
une condition de notre mariage.
Et tu fais Áa dans mon dos ?
TrŤs bien, excuse-moi d'avoir pensť
que tu aurais pu changer d'avis.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a de si spťcial
dans cette ville pour...
que tu y sois tant attachťe ?
Cette ville, c'est mon histoire.
C'est tout ce que
je connais et que j'aime.
Je veux voir mes enfants y grandir.
Si tu comprends pas Áa,
alors peut-Ítre...
Peut-Ítre quoi ?
Je ne prendrai pas
l'avion avec toi ce soir.
Si tu dťcides de prendre ce boulot,
c'est pas la peine de revenir.
Je suis fatiguťe.
Alison,
il y a deux chambres en haut.
EmmŤne ton frŤre dans celle de droite.
C'est lŗ que tu dormiras.
C'est ŗ qui tout Áa ?
Qui habite ici ?
Nous.
Monte. J'arrive dans une minute.
Viens Sammy.
Je vais te lire une histoire.
Je ne sais pas
ce qu'il se passe Robert,
et pour le moment, je suis...
Je suis trop ťpuisťe pour me dťfendre,
mais je te promets une chose :
demain, d'une maniŤre ou
d'une autre, je te ferai arrÍter.
Mais tu sais, demain,
beaucoup de choses vont changer.
Freddy, viens lŗ.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
- Ravenwood.
Ces enfoirťs m'ont tirť dessus !
Oh mon Dieu !
Doucement, doucement.
Va chercher Anna.
Assure-toi qu'elle va bien.
On va d'abord t'amener ŗ l'hopital.
Tout ce qui m'importe,
c'est Anna et mon enfant.
Fais-les monter dans ce bus.
Et aprŤs, disparais aussi !
Ils vont te trouver.
Ils te recherchent dťjŗ.
Reste avec moi.
<i>911. Quel est votre problŤme ?</i>
J'ai besoin d'une ambulance.
On a tirť sur mon ami,
il perd beaucoup de sang.
<i>Il respire ?</i>
Reste avec moi, Freddy !
<i>Monsieur, est-ce qu'il respire ?</i>
Reste avec moi, mec.
Allez, mec, reste avec moi.
Tout ira bien.
Tout ira bien.
Reste avec moi.
J'arrive pas ŗ croire qu'il soit mort.
12 HEURES AVANT LES BOMBES

C'est pas de ta faute. Tu as...
T'as fait tout ce que t'as pu.
J'en veux pas.

AprŤs tout ce temps,

Rťserve le voyage.

J'espŤre bien.
Je suis Stanley Richmond.

- Non.
Lŗ, c'est le moment oý

Vraiment ?
Et bien, je suis...

Vous ne lisez jamais votre courrier ?
Non. Que des factures et des

Sommes-nous en danger, Robert ?
Je t'ai posť cette question
une centaine de fois,
tu as toujours rťpondu non.
Je ne...
veux pas t'effrayer, D.
On fera ce que tu nous dis.
Je te fais confiance.
Mon Dieu.
D'oý viennent-ils ?
Je vais avoir besoin d'eau chaude,
autant que tu peux.
J'ai fait une liste des blessťs.
Comment il va ?
Je pense qu'il est
en ťtat de choc.
Il ne veut pas Ítre soignť
avant que tous les autres l'aient ťtť.
- Jake, je...
- Vas-y.
Il va avoir besoin de toi.
<i>Vous souffrez de lťgŤres gelures

Je vois que vous Ítes diplŰmť
d'Embry-Riddle.
Pilote certifiť ATP,
1600 heures de vol...
Vous Ítes qualifiť,
M. Green, c'est certain.
Voler, j'ai Áa dans le sang.
ņ 10 ans, je pilotais l'avion de mon
grand-pŤre pour traiter les champs.
Vous comprenez que nous
transportons uniquement
des hommes d'affaires
et des cťlťbritťs, donc...
une discrťtion absolue est de
rigueur pour notre ťquipage.
…coutez, j'assure la sťcuritť du vol
du point A au point B, et le reste...
ne me regarde pas.
TrŤs bien.
Nous faisons des recherches
sur les personnes qui
vont piloter nos avions.
Et d'aprŤs vos visas,
vous avez passť quelques
annťes au Moyen-Orient.
14 mois en Afghanistan,
6 en Irak.
Mais vous n'ťtiez pas dans l'armťe ?
Je travaillais pour
un entrepreneur civil.
Ce n'est pas notť dans votre CV.
Je ne pensais pas que c'ťtait important.
Le Dťpartement d'Etat s'intťresse
de prŤs ŗ votre cas.
Je suis un type intťressant.
Il y a eu un accident.
J'ťtais au mauvais endroit
au mauvais moment.
Pour quel entrepreneur travailliez-vous
quand cet accident s'est produit ?
- L'un des plus importants.
- Halliburton, Blackwater ?
Vous disiez que la discrťtion
ťtait de rigueur.
Je vais Ítre direct...
Je pense que notre opťration
peut vous accueillir...
mais pour que je vous embauche,
vous devrez tirer Áa au clair.
Vous me comprenez ?
Merci de m'avoir accordť du temps.

Ce sont de bonnes nouvelles.
On parle d'ici ou de

J'attends de savoir.
Fťlicitations.
C'ťtait ton idťe.
Je dois bien dire que...

33 HEURES AVANT LES BOMBES
- Hť, papa, t'as un moment ?
- Nan.
USA Today organise un concours
pour ťlire 5 villes de moins
de 5000 habitants.
Je pensais qu'on pourrait
proposer Jericho.
Pourquoi ? Pour que des investisseurs
commencent ŗ racheter la ville,
et transformer Main Street
en centre commercial
avec une demi-douzaine
de coffee-shop ?
Papa, il y a bien pire que
"vente frappuccinos".
Parle anglais.
«a pourrait Ítre une bonne chose.
Le genre de gros titre qui pourrait
attirer les ťlecteurs le mois prochain.
Fiston, peu m'importe
de battre Gray Anderson.
Les gens de cette ville votent
pour moi depuis 20 ans.
J'obtiendrai leurs voix
en faisant le boulot
pour lequel ils m'ont ťlu.
Qu'est-ce que vous
faites ici, les filles ?
Ton pŤre n'est pas allť
faire son checkup ce matin.
Et April a ťtť assez gentille
pour prendre sur sa pause de midi...
et faire une visite ŗ domicile.
Dťsolť, Doc, mais il va falloir
reporter Áa aprŤs les ťlections.
Johnston !
Tu vas faire ce check-up,
que tu le veuilles ou non.
J'ai attrapť froid,
et Áa fait une semaine que tu
ne te sens pas trŤs bien.
C'est une mauvaise grippe.
La moitiť de mon ťquipe
a ťtť touchťe.
Tu veux te dťshabiller ici...
ou tu prťfŤres le faire dans
un endroit plus intime ?
Dans mon bureau.
Voilŗ mon homme !
Comment Áa s'est passť ?
Et bien, Freddy... merci pour
ta cravate porte-bonheur.
"Recherche chauffeur avec
expťrience militaire.
Possibilitťs de voyager."
Mon petit doigt me dit que
ce ne sera pas aux Bahamas.
J'ai besoin de bosser.
T'es pas chauffeur, mec.
T'es pilote, et un sacrť bon mÍme.
En ce moment, je suis
surtout fauchť.
ņ moins que tu ne veuilles
payer mon loyer.
Pardon ?
Par contre, ce que je peux faire...
C'est te payer un verre.
Ohť ! Mira !
Sers-nous deux biŤres.
Et les bonnes maniŤres ?
J'espŤre que tu ne m'as pas sifflťe
comme un chien.
- Oh, chťrie...
- Pas de "chťrie", chťri.
T'es trop radin en pourboires.
Et cette alliance ŗ ton doigt,
elle compte pas ?
T'as fini par te passer
la corde au cou, Freddy ?
- Bravo.
- Merci mon pote.
Hť, elle a des soeurs pas mal.
ņ moins que tu sois toujours accro
ŗ cette fermiŤre dans l'Iowa.
- Au Kansas.
- C'est pareil.
Non, c'est pas pareil.
Ouais. Attends.
Reste ici, d'accord ?

<i>Sarah, le planning a ťtť modifiť.</i>
«a va se passer demain pendant
le discours du prťsident.
<i>Je serai lŗ dŤs que possible</i>
mais j'ai un truc ŗ faire avant.
Tu emballes tout et je te
rejoins dŤs que possible.
Oý vas-tu ?
<i>Chercher mes enfants.</i>
<i>Robert, on n'a pas le temps.</i>
Robert !
Anna.
- Fťlicitations.
- Merci.
C'est un bon gars.
Je ne sais pas ŗ quel point, mais...
il a promis de veiller sur moi.
- C'est de la folie, mais je le crois.
- C'est quoi Áa ?
Mon tťmoin qui drague ma fiancťe ?
Tťmoin ?
Il te faut une demande en rŤgle ?
Tu es plus un frŤre pour moi que
celui avec lequel j'ai grandi.
Pas de problŤme.
«a me fait plaisir.
Moi aussi, j'ai de bonnes nouvelles.
Euh, mon coeur, tu veux bien...
nous laisser seuls un moment ?
Et si je te disais que j'ai rťussi
ŗ trouver un petit boulot ?
8 semaines,
100 000$, cash.
Quelle sorte de boulot ?
Le genre qu'on connaÓt bien.
Du fret.
Vite fait, bien fait.
30 000$ d'avance,
70 000$ ŗ l'arrivťe.
Oý Áa ?
En Afghanistan.
- Non.
- Allez.
«a fait combien de temps que tu
cherches ? 6 mois ?
On fait ce boulot-lŗ,
et aprŤs on est pťnards.
Tu pourras ouvrir une ťcole
de pilotage, rentrer chez toi,
revoir cette fille !
- Pourquoi tu me fais Áa ?
Comment peux-tu
me demander Áa
aprŤs ce qu'on a vu lŗ-bas,
ce qu'on a fait.
Tout ce qu'on a fait, c'est
rester en vie, J.
Des innocents sont morts, Freddy.
Des personnes innocentes.
Je les vois dŤs que
je ferme les yeux.
Ce qui est dťjŗ assez
rare ces temps-ci.
Et bien, cette fois-ci on
sera plus malins, mec.
Tu sais que je te
couvrirai, mec.
Je suis dťsolť.
Tu vas devoir te dťbrouiller tout seul
cette fois. Je ne peux pas y retourner.
Tu sais quoi, Jerry,
si tu acceptes un face ŗ face,
je t'en ferai baver
au stade de Wrigley.
Sťrieux.
Je le jure sur une boÓte de cookies.
Gťnial.
ņ 6 heures ŗ la salle
d'entraÓnement.
On se voit lŗ-bas.
Encore Chicago ?
Hť Prof, c'est la pause dťjeuner ?
Tu veux m'aider ŗ prťparer
mon programme ou...
ŗ corriger 30 dissertations sur
La Ferme des Animaux d'Orwell ?
Non, j'ai une meilleure idťe.
DťlŤgue ce boulot
et suis-moi ŗ Chicago ce soir.
«a ferait bonne impression
face ŗ mes ťlŤves.
Je t'ťcrirai un mot d'excuse.
"Chers enfants, dťsolťe,
il n'y aura pas classe aujourd'hui.
Je suis en train de m'enfiler
des biŤres avec mon fiancť...
et de me laisser aller aux
plaisirs du sexe ŗ Chicago."
Chicago est plus connu
pour ses pizzas, non ?!
Pour Áa aussi.
Une nuit.
Tes ťlŤves rattraperont.
C'est bon.
Sťrieusement ?
Tu vas pas essayer de
me dissuader, si ?
Non, non, non,
assez parlť.
<i>46 plaquages, trois sacs</i>
<i>et quelques interceptions...</i>
«a va ?
Je m'inquiŤte pour Freddy.
Tu veux une biŤre ?
Non.
Je pense que quelque
chose le tracasse.
De quoi tu parles ?
Ces types lui tournent autour.
Comme...
des soldats, mais ils ne le sont pas.
Ils sont arrivťs aprŤs ton dťpart.
Et alors, c'est un grand garÁon.
Il traine avec qui il veut.
C'est pas Áa.
En rentrant, Freddy
avait un cocard,
il a dit qu'il partait deux mois,
qu'il fallait pas le chercher.
Demande-lui de rester.
Tu crois que j'ai pas essayť ?
Il m'a dit qu'il n'avait pas le choix,
qu'il faisait Áa pour moi.
Que veux-tu que j'y fasse ?
Aide-le.
Rejoins-le.
Je sais ce qu'il a fait
pour toi en Irak.
Je sais que tu lui dois la vie.
Ouais.
«a n'a plus l'air
trŤs important maintenant...
Je suis enceinte, Jake.
Je...
J'ai un mauvais pressentiment.
- Robert, que...
- Ne crie pas.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais lŗ ?
Tu dois me suivre.
…coute, me dis pas
ce que je dois faire.
Tu ne dois pas nous approcher
ŗ moins de 150 mŤtres.
Les circonstances ont changť, Darcy.
<i>Maman!</i>
<i>Maman.</i>
Mon Dieu. Les enfants.
Dťverrouille de l'intťrieur.
Alison, Áa va aller.
Laisse-les sortir, Robert,
ou je me mets ŗ hurler.
Non, ťcoute-moi attentivement.
Dans cinq secondes,
je monte dans ce camion
et je quitte Washington
pour de bon.
Et je ne suis pas venu
pour en discuter avec toi.
Maintenant tu peux me croire,
et venir avec nous
ou alors rester ici.
Mais tu ne reverras jamais tes enfants.
30 HEURES AVANT LES BOMBES
Hť mon pote,
t'es de la partie ?
Ouais.
Content que t'aies changť d'avis.
Je te le dis,
une opportunitť comme Áa,
Áa n'arrive qu'une fois.
Pourtant, c'est pas la premiŤre fois
que je t'entends dire Áa.
Fais-moi plaisir.
Projette-toi de quelques mois.
Imagine-toi sur...
une plage Mexicaine,
entourť de bikinis
et de billets de 100$.
J'essaie de ne pas
me projeter si loin.
«a m'aide ŗ relativiser
quand tout part en vrille.
Mon pŤre m'a dit une fois,
si tu ne gardes pas un
oeil sur ton objectif,
tu ne l'atteindras jamais.
En parlant d'oeil...
Tu devrais voir l'autre type.
Bien, prťsente-le-moi.
On bosse pour qui, Freddy?
T'occupe pas.
Ils te connaissent, de rťputation.
Je ne vais nulle part
avant de savoir.
C'est une branche de Ravenwood.
Tu les verras demain,
avant de monter dans l'avion.
En attendant,
tout ce dont tu dois te prťoccuper...
c'est Áa.
Le triple t'attend...
quand tout sera fini.
On doit simplement
conduire le convoi ŗ travers
les lignes ennemies sans se faire tuer.
Combien de fois je dois te sauver les
fesses pour que t'y penses plus, hein ?
<i>DEMANDE DE DIVORCE</i>
<i>DEMANDE DE DIVORCE
Le demandeur APRIL GREEN dťclare...</i>
Le siŤge est ŗ vous.
Merci.
Ouais, je dťteste m'asseoir
quand il n'y a pas d'argent en jeu.
<i>Il frappe, la balle s'envole trŤs loin.</i>
<i>Il court, il y est !</i>
Mary Bailey, tu me dois 5$ !
Paie-moi !
J'ai mieux, j'ai mieux.
Apporte donc, euh,
un verre ŗ ma charmante
compagne, c'est pour moi.
Ne gaspillez pas votre argent,
c'est couvert par les frais.
Quel est votre meilleur vin ?
La biŤre.
Vodka, avec glace.
Vous saviez qu'il faut
3 heures de taxi pour venir
de l'aťroport ŗ cette maudite ville ?
Mais c'est pittoresque, non ?
Si on aime le maÔs, oui.
Mais enfin, qui n'aime pas le maÔs ?
Je veux dire il y a,
le maÔs en ťpi,
les cornflakes, le maÔs frit,
la saucisse au maÔs,
le maÔs en tube.
Le maÔs en tube ?
C'est une blague, Melle.
Vous pouvez arrÍter de
me parler, s'il vous plait !
Merci.
- MaÔs, maÔs grillť ?
- Sťrieusement.
Oubliez-moi.
Bailey's.
<i>Salut toi.</i>
Salut.
Je vais te voir cette semaine ?
<i>Et bien, tu peux
me voir tout de suite.</i>
<i>Retourne-toi.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?</i>
Tu n'as pas idťe
<i>ŗ quel point j'ai envie
de t'embrasser lŗ.</i>
Et bien.
<i>Pourquoi tu ne viendrais
pas dans mon bureau ?</i>
Mais qu'est-ce que...
tu m'as mis lŗ-dedans ?
Le moment est venu pour
certains changements, Johnston,
en commenÁant par ton alimentation.
Un homme ne peut pas vivre avec Áa.
Il pourra s'il veut rester
mariť avec moi.
Ta tension ťtait beaucoup trop
ťlevťe lors de ton dernier examen.
C'est le stress. Elle est toujours
ťlevťe en pťriode d'ťlections.
Alors, retire-toi de la course.
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'arrive ?
Quelque chose m'est arrivť
en regardant April t'examiner.
Je me suis posť des questions.
Combien d'annťes nous
reste-t-il ŗ vivre ensemble ?
Elle t'a dit quelque chose ?
Car elle m'a dit que
c'ťtait qu'un coup de froid.
Non,
ce n'est pas ŗ propos
de ta santť ou de la mienne.
Quand tu es rentrť en fonction,
tu as fait deux promesses.
Une aux gens de cette ville,
et l'autre ŗ moi.
Tu te rappelles ce que tu as dit ?
Oui.
Que le travail ne passerait
jamais avant ma famille.
Je te demande juste
de trouver un ťquilibre.
J'ai compris, chťrie.
Restez lŗ.
Maman, fais quelque chose.
Robert, laisse-nous partir.
Je t'en supplie.
Je reviens dans cinq minutes.
- Et aprŤs?
- Et aprŤs...
on quitte la ville.
T'es fou, je ne pars
nulle part avec toi.
Papa, arrÍte. Papa !
L‚che-la, Robert !
…coute-moi, d'accord ?
Je ne te ferai jamais de mal,
ni ŗ ta mŤre, ni ŗ ton frŤre.
Tu me crois ?
Est-ce que tu me crois ?
Je te connais ŗ peine.
…coute, Robert,
tu effraies Samuel.
Rassure-le, Darcy.
Tu as ton portable ?
Non, il l'a pris quand il m'a attrapťe.
Pas le mien.
Vraiment ?
Oý est-il, chťri ?
Dans mon sac ŗ dos.
<i>911. Quel est votre problŤme ?</i>
La porte ťtait ouverte.
J'adore l'amťnagement de la piŤce.
Que voulez-vous, Agent Hicks ?
Devinez quel nom est apparu
sur la liste des passagers
d'un vol international ?
J'ai plus le droit de
prendre l'avion, maintenant ?
Non, pas encore, mais...
Je pensais que, peut-Ítre...
On pourrait conclure un accord.
Vous Ítes sur le point de vous allier
avec des gens peu frťquentables, Jake.
Heureusement pour vous,
votre timing est parfait.
On cherche ŗ coincer Ravenwood.
Pourquoi Áa ?
Ils font de la contrebande d'armes
depuis le dťbut de la guerre.
Ils vendraient des armes ŗ
n'importe qui, mÍme ŗ nos ennemis.
On a besoin d'un complice
qui puisse paraÓtre crťdible.
Et pourquoi j'accepterais ?
Parce que...
... vous savez bien
de quoi ils sont capables.
Sarah, allez, on n'a pas...
Sarah ?
Ne bougez plus.
L‚chez la malette.
Avancez lentement vers moi.
Les mains en l'air...
Tout de suite !
C'est votre camion ?
Il est louť.
Je dťmťnage.
Quel est le problŤme ?
Ouvrez la porte arriŤre.
D'accord.
Qu'est-ce que...
Menotte-le.
Les mains derriŤre le dos.
A l'aide ! Ouvrez la porte.
S'il vous plait.
On va vous sortir de lŗ.
- Vous pouvez ouvrir la porte ?
- Non !
Pouvez-vous ouvrir ?
Attention !
Salut Papa.
- Salut Eric.
- Mary.
Chťrie, tu peux lui apporter une biŤre ?
Bien sŻr.
Merci.
24 HEURES AVANT LES BOMBES
Alors, euh...
Pourquoi je t'ai fait venir ?
Ouais. Tout va bien ?
Ta mŤre et moi avons...
discutť de notre avenir.
Pour Ítre plus prťcis, elle...
a soulignť le fait que je ne semblais
pas prÍt ŗ tourner la page.
C'est du Maman tout crachť.
Quand j'ai pris ce travail,
t'ťtais en... quoi ? CE2 ?
CE1.
On a gagnť le trophťe
de football cette annťe-lŗ.
J'ai inscrit deux touchdowns
pendant la finale.
«a date, c'est dur de se rappeler.
Peut-Ítre parce que
t'ťtais pas au match, Papa.
C'est vrai.
Bref,
ta mŤre a peur que si je...
continue comme Áa,
on va finir par manquer
bien plus que des matchs de foot.
J'y ai rťflťchi,
et j'aimerais te poser une question.
Si je laissais tomber
la course aux ťlections,
est-ce que tu prendrais ma place ?
Quoi ?
Tu ferais un bon candidat, fiston.
T'as toujours vťcu ici,
t'as une vie saine,
pas comme ton frŤre Jake.
De plus, ťgoÔstement, je pourrais...
lever le pied et nťanmoins, garder une
influence sur ce qu'il se passe.
T'es sťrieux ?
Et bien, tu...
T'es intelligent, directif.
T'as mÍme un diplŰme de droit.
Que j'ai l'intention d'utiliser un jour.
Comme beaucoup d'autres choses.
Rien dont tu m'aies parlť.
DÓtes-moi s'il vous faut autre chose.
Rťflťchis-y cette nuit.
Parles-en ŗ April.
«a la concerne aussi.
- Quoi de neuf ?
- Faut qu'on parle.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Ce qu'on transporte pour Ravenwood,
tu sais ce que c'est ?
Je pose pas ce genre de questions, mec.
Des missiles Stinger.
Des lance-roquettes.
C'est pas comme si
c'ťtait une mission humanitaire.
Ils les vendent aux rebelles, Freddy.
Ils serviront ŗ tuer
nos propres hommes !
Les fťdťraux sont sur le coup.
Ils veulent qu'on les aide
ŗ dťmanteler Ravenwood.
T'es malade ?
On n'a pas le choix.
Ils nous surveillent.
Ravenwood aussi, mec.
Ils me font plus peur
que le gouvernement.
Si on marche pas avec les fťdťraux,
ils s'arrangeront pour que
Ravenwood croit que c'est le cas.
- T'as ton argent sur toi ?
- Quoi ?
- Ton argent.
- Ouais, pas loin.
Va chercher Anna, des affaires,
on se voit dans une heure.
- Et ensuite ?
- On dťcolle ce soir.
S'ils nous poursuivent,
au moins, on aura de l'avance.
D'accord ?
Il vaudrait mieux que
personne de l'ťcole ne nous voit.
«a serait difficile de prendre l'avion
et de prťtendre Ítre malade demain.
Tu sais, ŗ Chicago,
tu pourrais marcher des kms
sans rencontrer
quelqu'un que tu connais.
Vraiment ? Encore Chicago ?
En plus, il y a les pizzas,
les Cubs, la culture...
Oý veux-tu en venir ?
Je dois te dire quelque chose.
C'est pas un simple rendez-vous demain.
C'est une entrevue pour
firme d'actionnaires.
Ultime entrevue, en fait.
T'es sťrieux ?
J'ai pensť que tu pourrais
en profiter pour visiter la ville.
Tu vas adorer.
T'es qu'un con.
Emily, on pourrait au moins en parler.
On en a dťjŗ parlť.
C'est pas le genre d'opportunitť
ŗ laquelle on peut dire non.
Vraiment ?
Non.
Tu vois. C'est pas si difficile.
J'arrive pas ŗ y croire.
On doit se marier dans quelques mois.
Pourquoi crois-tu que je fais Áa ?
Parce que t'es ťgoÔste,
et que t'ťcoutes rien.
Ne pas dťmťnager ťtait
une condition de notre mariage.
Et tu fais Áa dans mon dos ?
TrŤs bien, excuse-moi d'avoir pensť
que tu aurais pu changer d'avis.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a de si spťcial
dans cette ville pour...
que tu y sois tant attachťe ?
Cette ville, c'est mon histoire.
C'est tout ce que
je connais et que j'aime.
Je veux voir mes enfants y grandir.
Si tu comprends pas Áa,
alors peut-Ítre...
Peut-Ítre quoi ?
Je ne prendrai pas
l'avion avec toi ce soir.
Si tu dťcides de prendre ce boulot,
c'est pas la peine de revenir.
Je suis fatiguťe.
Alison,
il y a deux chambres en haut.
EmmŤne ton frŤre dans celle de droite.
C'est lŗ que tu dormiras.
C'est ŗ qui tout Áa ?
Qui habite ici ?
Nous.
Monte. J'arrive dans une minute.
Viens Sammy.
Je vais te lire une histoire.
Je ne sais pas
ce qu'il se passe Robert,
et pour le moment, je suis...
Je suis trop ťpuisťe pour me dťfendre,
mais je te promets une chose :
demain, d'une maniŤre ou
d'une autre, je te ferai arrÍter.
Mais tu sais, demain,
beaucoup de choses vont changer.
Freddy, viens lŗ.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
- Ravenwood.
Ces enfoirťs m'ont tirť dessus !
Oh mon Dieu !
Doucement, doucement.
Va chercher Anna.
Assure-toi qu'elle va bien.
On va d'abord t'amener ŗ l'hopital.
Tout ce qui m'importe,
c'est Anna et mon enfant.
Fais-les monter dans ce bus.
Et aprŤs, disparais aussi !
Ils vont te trouver.
Ils te recherchent dťjŗ.
Reste avec moi.
<i>911. Quel est votre problŤme ?</i>
J'ai besoin d'une ambulance.
On a tirť sur mon ami,
il perd beaucoup de sang.
<i>Il respire ?</i>
Reste avec moi, Freddy !
<i>Monsieur, est-ce qu'il respire ?</i>
Reste avec moi, mec.
Allez, mec, reste avec moi.
Tout ira bien.
Tout ira bien.
Reste avec moi.
J'arrive pas ŗ croire qu'il soit mort.

"S'il vous plaÓt, pourriez-vous
me passer le sucre ?"
Rťserve le voyage.

Je pensais plutŰt pour NoŽl.
Et allez, rťserve pour l'Italie aussi.

<i>Vous avez un nouveau message.</i>
<i>Salut, Emily, c'est Roger.</i>
<i>J'ai essayť d'appeler sur ton portable

<i>Je ne suis pas allť ŗ cet entretien.</i>
Oh, excusez-moi.
Excusez-moi.
Oh, c'est vous.
Dťsolť, on se connait ?
Ecoutez, Áa fait des heures

Je vous suggŤre de demander
gentiment ŗ quelqu'un de vous emmener.
Vous savez oý est

J'espŤre bien.
Je suis Stanley Richmond.
- Vous plaisantez ?
- Non.
Lŗ, c'est le moment oý
vous me dites votre nom.
Mimi Clark.
Vraiment ?
Et bien, je suis...
ravi de vous rencontrer, Mlle Clark.
Vous ne lisez jamais votre courrier ?
Non. Que des factures et des
mauvaises nouvelles. Pourquoi ?
On peut dire que
c'est un peu des deux.
Je travaille pour le Fisc.
Et selon nos renseignements,
vous avez plus de 180 000$
d'impŰts impayťs.
Ravie de faire votre connaissance.

C'est vraiment toi ?
Je te croyais mort.
Viens. Suis-moi.
Il nous reste une demi-heure avant

Je suis sŻre qu'on peut

Il nous reste des couvertures ?
J'ai apportť toutes celles

Il faut trouver un docteur.
Je vais bien.
Il reste beaucoup de monde lŗ-dehors ?
On peut organiser une recherche.
21 hommes,

Je vais les compter.
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'est arrivť ?
On a attendu dans ce champ

J'ai marchť pendant...

La plupart d'entre eux

J'ai du mal ŗ imaginer

J'ai dit que j'avais du mal
ŗ imaginer ce que tu as vu.
Je n'aurais jamais imaginť non plus.
Lave-toi les mains,

Darcy, il faut que tu gardes

Nice planes.
Yeah, every aircraft
we operate is augmented
with custom security
and design features
you won't find
in any other fleet.
I see that you're
an Embry-Riddle grad.
ATP-certified,
1,600 verified FAA hours.
Clearly well qualified,
Mr. Green.
Flying's in my blood.
I started working on my Grandpa's
crop duster when I was 10.
Now you understand
that we charter
exclusively
to top executives
and celebrity clients,
so absolute discretion
is a must for our flight crew.
Hey, anything past
getting the plane
safely from "A to "B"
is none of my business.
Good, of course, finding
out everything we can
about the people who are piloting
our planes is our business.
And according
to your visa records,
you spent a little time in the
Middle East over the last few years.
14 months in Afghanistan, 6 in Iraq.
But you were never military?
I worked for an
independent contractor.
Left that off the resum.
I didn't think
it was relevant.
State Department has you
flagged as a person of interest.
I'm an interesting guy.
There was an incident.
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
Which contractor
were you working with
when this
incident occurred?
One of the big ones.
- Halliburton, Blackwater?
- You said discretion was a must.
Look, I'm going to be straight with you.
I think there's room in our operation
for someone like you,
but there is no way
that I can hire you if you
are unable to clear this up.
Do you understand that?
Thank you for your time.
<i>The president is scheduled
to address the nation tomorrow</i>
<i>amid growing disapproval.</i>
<i>Recent polls show his rating
plunging double digits</i>
<i>into the 20s,
even amongst partisan voters.</i>
<i>With midterm elections
on the horizon,</i>
<i>this is not a good sign
for the administration.</i>
I've already been
summoned, Sarah.
They want me in position.
This is good news.
We talking locally
or back to the farmland?
I'm waiting to hear.
Congratulations.
It was your idea.
I have to say that...
when they recruited me,
I thought I was prepared
for just about anything.
But nothing like this.
Well, that's because
nothing like this...
has ever happened before.
This is it.
Yes.
This is the moment
we've prepared for.
All the devices
have been secured.
The other cells are receiving
their instructions as we speak.
The target cities
have been confirmed.
Your routes have been scouted
and cleared.
We're ready.
The strike will go off tomorrow
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.
Take a look around you,
gentlemen.
These are the faces of the men
who will change the world.
Season 1 Episode 12
"The Day Before"
Transcript: swsub.com
Synchro: Loky
[ www.seriessub.com ]
- Hey, Dad, you got a second?
- Nope.
USA Today's having a contest
to find the top five
towns under 5,000.
I was thinking we
should submit Jericho.
Why, so some big
developer can come in
and start buying
the town up,
maybe turn Main Street
into a strip mall
with a half a dozen
coffee shops or so?
Dad, there are worse things in the world
- than vente frappuccinos.
- Speak English.
This could be a good thing.
The kind of headlines
that will bring out voters next month.
Son, I am not worried
about beating Gray Anderson.
The people of this town
have kept me in office
for over 20 years.
I will earn their votes
by doing the job
they hired me to do.
What are you guys doing here?
Your father missed
his checkup this morning
and April was nice enough
to take off
her lunch hour
to make a house call.
Well, sorry, Doc, but we're
gonna have to reschedule
- for sometime after the election.
- Johnston.
You're gonna do this
whether you like it or not.
I've had this terrible cold
and you've not been feeling
well for almost a week.
It's a bad one.
Half my staff
has come down with it.
Do you want to strip here
or would you like to go
somewhere a little less public?
My office.
That's my guy.
Yo, yo, how'd it go?
Well, Freddy...
so much for your lucky tie.
"Driver wanted.
Military experience.
Plus, travel opportunities."
Something tells me they're not
talking about the Bahamas.
I need a job.
You're no driver, man.
You're a pilot,
a freakin' good one.
Right now, all I am is broke.
Unless you want
to pay my rent for me.
Sorry?!
Tell you what I can do, though.
Set you up with a drink.
Oye! Mira!
Hit us up with a couple
of cervezas.
What's up with you
and the manners?
I know you didn't just whistle
for me like some dog.
- Oh, baby...
- Don't you "baby" me, baby.
You're the worst
tipper in here.
What, that ring on your finger,
that don't count?
Finally pulled
the trigger, Freddy?
- All right.
- You know it, baby.
Hey, she's got some
good-looking sisters.
Unless you're still all hung up
on that farm girl back in Iowa.
- Kansas.
- Same thing.
No, not the same thing.
Yeah. Hold on a second.
Don't go anywhere,
all right?
Where am I gonna go?
<i>Sarah, the schedule's changed.</i>
It's happening tomorrow
during the President's address.
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can,</i>
but there's something
I need to take care of.
You get everything together
and I'll meet you back as soon as I can.
Where are you going?
<i>To get my kids.</i>
<i>Robert, there isn't enough time.</i>
Robert!
Anna.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
He's a good man.
I don't know
how good he his, but...
he promised to take care of me.
- Call me crazy, I believe him.
- What's this?
My best man hitting
on my fiance?
Best man?
You gonna make me ask?
You're more a brother to me
than the one I grew up with.
Back at ya.
I'm happy to do it.
Got some more good news, too.
Uh, sweetie, will you...
will you give us
a moment to talk?
What if I told you
I got a gig lined up?
Eight weeks,
a hundred G's, all cash.
What kind of gig?
The kind we're good at.
Cargo run.
Quick in, quick out.
$30,000 up front,
$70,000 when it's done.
Where?
Afghanistan.
- No.
- Come on.
You've been looking
for work for what, six months?
We do this one gig
and we are set.
You could open that flight school.
Maybe go home, snag back that girl.
Why are you doing this to me?
I can't believe you'd even ask
after what we saw over there,
what we did.
All we did was
not get killed, J.
Innocent people died, Freddy.
Innocent people.
I see it every time
I close my eyes.
Which isn't too damn often
these days.
Well, we'll be smarter
this time, man.
You know that I got
your back, man.
I'm sorry.
You're on your own this time.
I can't go back there.
I'll tell you what, Jerry,
you agree
to sit down face to face,
I'll flip you a pair of
open day boxes at Wrigley.
No strings.
I swear on a stack
of cheddar dogs.
Great.
6:00 at The Pump Room.
See you there.
Chicago again?
Hey, teach, half day?
Feel like helping me
prepare a syllabus or...
grading 30 essays on
Orwell's Animal Farm?
No, I have a better idea.
Have a sub do that and come
to Chicago with me tonight.
That would send
a great message to my students.
I'll write a letter for you.
"Dear kids, sorry I can't teach
you ungrateful brats today.
"I'm with my fiance getting drunk
on draft beer and having
tons of Chicago-style sex."
I think it's Chicago-style pizza.
That, too.
One night.
Your students will catch up.
Book it.
Seriously?
You're not going to try
to talk me out of it now, are you?
No. I'm done talking.
<i>46 tackles, three sacks</i>
<i>and a couple of interceptions...</i>
You all right?
I'm worried
about Freddy.
You want a beer?
No.
I think he's in over
his head with something.
What are you talking about?
These guys started
coming around.
Like...
soldiers but not.
They, they came by
again after you left.
Well, he's a big boy.
He can hang out
with whoever he chooses.
It's not like that.
When he came back,
Freddy had a black eye, saying
he's going away for two months
and not to try to find him.
Tell him you don't want him to go.
You don't think I did that?
He says he doesn't
have a choice,
that he's doing it for me.
What do you want me to do?
Help him.
Go with him if you have to.
I know what he did for you
in Iraq.
I know you owe him your life.
Yeah.
That doesn't appear to be
worth very much, right now.
I'm pregnant, Jake.
I just...
I have a bad feeling
about all this.
- Robert, what...
- Don't make a scene.
What are you doing here?
You need to come with me.
Look, don't tell me
what to do.
You are not allowed
within 500 feet of this family.
Circumstances have changed, Darcy.
Mom!
Mom.
Oh, my God. The kids.
Unlock the door from the inside.
Alison, it's, it's okay.
It's okay.
You let them out of there right now,
or so help me,
I'll start screaming.
No, you listen to me
very carefully.
In five seconds,
I'm getting on this truck
and I am leaving
Washington for good.
And I did not come here
to discuss this with you.
Now you can
either trust me,
and come with us
or you can stay here.
But you will never ever
see your children again.
Hey, buddy, you in?
I'm in.
Glad you changed your mind.
I'm telling you,
this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Then how come this isn't the first time
I've heard you say that?
Do me a favor.
Skip ahead in your mind
a couple of months.
Visualize yourself on a...
Mexican beach,
knee deep in bikinis
and Benjamins.
I try not to think
that far ahead.
Keeps me from being disappointed
when things go to hell.
My pop once told me
if you don't keep an eye
towards where you're going,
you'll never get there.
Speaking of eyes...
You should see the other guy.
Fine, introduce us.
Who's the job for, Freddy?
Don't matter who.
They know you, and
your reputation.
I'm not going anywhere
until I know.
It's an offshoot of Ravenwood.
You'll meet 'em, tomorrow
right before we get on a plane.
In the meantime,
all you gotta worry about...
is this.
There's three times that
waiting for you
when this is over.
All we gotta do is
run a convoy through enemy territory
without getting killed.
How many times I gotta get your back
before you start believing it, huh?
Seat's all yours.
Thank you.
Yeah, I hate, I hate sitting when
I got money on a game.
<i>Swung on, it's a high
blast out toward left field.</i>
<i>It's way back, and it is gone!</i>
Mary Bailey, you owe me five bucks.
Pay up!
Better yet, better yet.
Buy my, uh,
good luck charm here,
a drink on me.
Don't waste your money,
I have an expense account.
What is your best wine?
Beer.
Vodka, rocks.
Did you know that it
is a three-hour cab ride
from the airport to
this godforsaken town?
Scenic, though, ain't it?
If you like corn.
Well, now,
who doesn't like corn?
I mean, you got
corn on the cob,
cornflakes, corn nuts,
corn dogs, cornsicles.
Cornsicles?
It's a joke, lady.
Can you not talk
to me, please?
Thank you.
- Corn, corn chips?
- Seriously.
Don't talk to me.
Bailey's.
<i>Hey, there.</i>
Hi.
Am I going to see you this week?
<i>Well, you can see me right now.</i>
<i>Just turn around.</i>
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
You have no idea
<i>how badly I want
to kiss you right now.</i>
Well.
<i>Why don't you step
into my office?</i>
What in the...
heck do we have here?
It's time for some changes, Johnston.
Starting with your diet.
A man can't live on that.
Can if he wants to
stay married to me.
Your blood pressure was ten
points over your last checkup.
Well, that's just the stress.
It's always up at election time.
Then drop out of the race.
What has gotten into you?
Something happened watching April
listen to your heartbeat.
I began to wonder.
How many good years do
we have left together?
Did you hear something I didn't?
'Cause all she told me was
I might be getting a cold.
This isn't,
this isn't just about health,
yours or mine.
When you first took office
you made two oaths.
One to the people
of this town,
and the other one to me.
Do you rember
what you said?
Yeah.
That I would never let the job
come before you and the kids.
I'm just asking
for equal time.
I hear you, honey.
You all stay put.
Mom, do something.
Robert, let us go.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'll be back
in five minutes.
- And then what?
- And then...
we leave town.
Oh, you're crazy,
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Dad, stop. Dad!
Let go of her,
Robert!
Listen to me, okay.
I would never do
anything to hurt you,
your mother, or your brother.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
I barely know you.
Listen, Robert,
you are scaring Samuel.
Unscare him, Darcy.
Do you have your cell phone?
No, he took it when
he picked me up.
Not mine.
Really?
Where is it, honey?
In my backpack.
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>
The door was unlocked.
I love what you've done
with the place.
What do you want, Agent Hicks?
Guess whose name
just popped up
on an international
passenger manifest?
You got me on
a no-fly list now?
No, not yet, but...
I thought maybe...
we could work out a deal.
You're about to get into bed
with some very bad people, Jake.
Lucky for you,
your timing is perfect.
We're looking to nail Ravenwood.
They did that?
They've been running weapons
since the start of the war.
They'll sell arms to anybody,
even our enemies.
We need someone working for us
that they'll
consider credible.
And why would I
say yes to you?
Because...
...you know firsthand
what they're capable of.
Sarah, come on, we don't have...
Sarah?
Hold it right there.
Drop the case.
Walk towards me slowly.
Put your hands in the air... now!
This your truck?
It's a rental.
Moving day, you know?
What seems to
be the problem?
Open the back.
Okay.
What the hell?
Cuff him.
Hands behind your back.
Help! Help!
Unlock the door.
- Please.
- It's okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.
- Can you open this door?
- We can't.
Can you unlock the door.
Watch out!
Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Eric.
- Mary.
Oh, darlin', would you get him
a beer, too?
Sure thing.
Thanks.
So, um...
Why did I ask you here?
Yeah. Is everything okay?
Uh, your mother and I have been...
talking about the next
chapter in our lives.
Be more accurate, she's...
pointing out how I seem to be
unwilling to turn the page.
Sounds like Mom.
When I first took office,
you were in... what? Third grade?
Second.
My team won the pee-wee
football trophy that year.
I scored two touchdowns
in the championship game.
Hard to remember
back that far.
Maybe because
you didn't make the game, Dad.
Right.
Well,
your mother is afraid that if I keep
going the way I'm going,
we're gonna wind up
missing more than
pee-wee football.
And I've been
thinking about it,
and I want to ask
you a question.
If I decided to drop
out of the race,
would you consider
running in my place?
What?
You'd make a good candidate, son.
You've been here
your whole life, you live clean,
unlike your brother Jake.
Plus, selfishly, I'd get to...
step down and still have some influence
over how things were run.
Oh, y-you're serious?
Well, you...
You're smart, you're decisive.
Even got yourself a law degree.
Which I plan on using some day.
Plan on doing a lot
of things some day.
Nothing you've
been sharing with me.
Let me know if you
need anything else.
So, you take the night
and think about it.
Talk to April about it.
It's gonna effect her, too.
Yeah.
Hey.
- What's up?
- We need to talk.
What's up?
Cargo, we're transporting
for Ravenwood,
you have any idea what it is?
I don't ask those kind
of questions, man.
Stinger Missiles. RPGs.
It's not like this was ever some
kind of humanitarian mission.
They've been selling them
to the insurgents, Freddie
They'll be used to kill our own guys!
The Feds are on
to the whole thing.
They want us to help
take down Ravenwood.
Whoa. Are you crazy?
We don't have a choice.
They're watching us.
So is Ravenwood, man.
I'm more worried about them
than the government.
If we don't work with the Feds,
they'll make sure
Ravenwood believes you are.
- You got your money with you?
- What?
- Your money.
- Yeah, I can get it.
Get Anna, grab whatever you can,
we'll meet in an hour.
- Then what?
- We'll take off tonight.
If they come after us, at least
we'll have a head start.
All right?
Nobody from school
better see us.
Gonna make it pretty hard for me
to get on that plane tonight
and call in sick tomorrow.
You know, if this was Chicago,
you could walk for miles
without ever running
into anyone you know.
Really? Chicago again?
Plus, there's the pizza,
the Cubs, the culture...
What are you getting at, huh?
Okay, I have a confession.
The meeting tomorrow
isn't just a meeting.
It's an interview for a startup
venture capital firm.
Final interview,
actually.
Are you serious?
Well, I thought maybe you could
get to know the city a little.
You might fall in love with it.
You're a jerk.
Emily, we have to at
least talk about it.
We have talked about this.
This is not the kind of opportunity
you can just say no to.
Really?
No.
There. How hard is that?
I cannot believe you.
We're supposed to be married
in a few months.
Why do you think I'm doing this?
Because you're selfish,
and you don't listen.
I told you when you proposed to me
I didn't want to move.
Now you go behind my back like this?
Yeah, well, screw me for thinking
you might be open
to changing your mind.
I mean, what is it about
this town that's got you so...
addicted to it?
This town is my history.
It is everything
that I know and love.
It's where I want
my kids to grow up.
If you don't understand that,
then maybe...
Maybe what?
I'm not getting on that plane
with you tonight.
If you decide to take that job tomorrow,
then don't bother coming back.
I'm tired.
Allison,
there are two bedrooms
upstairs.
Take your brother up to the one
on the right. That's where you'll sleep.
Who's stuff is all this?
Who lives here?
We do.
Go on upstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.
Come on, Sammy.
I'll read to you.
I don't know what's going on, Robert,
and right now, I'm...
I'm too exhausted to fight,
but I promise you one thing.
Come tomorrow,
one way or another,
I will have you arrested.
But you know, come tomorrow,
a whole lot of things
will be different.
Freddie, come here.
- All right. What happened?!
- Ravenwood.
Those sons a bitches shot me!
Oh, God!
Take it easy,
take it easy.
Find Anna.
Make sure she's all right.
First, we got to get
you to the hospital.
All I care about
is Anna and my kid.
Get them on that bus.
Then you get the hell
out of here, too!
They're gonna come after you.
Oh, they're coming after you.
Try to stay with me.
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>
I need an ambulance right away.
My friend's been shot,
he's lost a lot of blood.
<i>Is he breathing?</i>
Stay with me, Freddie!
<i>Sir, is he breathing?</i>
Stay with me, man.
Come on, man, stay with me.
You're all right.
You're all right.
Stay with me.
I can't believe he's gone.
I'm really sorry.
It's not your fault. You did...
You did everything that you could.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
It belonged to Freddie.
Use it for the baby.
My family will help me.
You keep it.
No.
I promised him.
Just put it away.
<i>Platform for Houston.
Platform six.</i>
You better go.
Come with me.
Come on,
you can start over, too.
No, I can't. Not yet.
Then where will you go?
You were up early.
Oh, I've been coughing all night.
I didn't want to wake you.
Paris.
I hate France.
I'm sure they'd be
devastated to hear it.
Studied French and Italian
for four years.
After all those years,
all I can remember is my name,
how to count to ten and,
"Would you please pass
that packet of sugar?"
Book the trip.
I don't think they take reservations
six years in advance.
I was thinking
more like Christmas.
What the hell.
Book one for Italy, too.
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Is anybody there?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
Jake.
<i>One new message.</i>
Hey, Emily, it's Roger.
Just tried your cell,
but I couldn't reach you.
Hopefully, you haven't run off
with the milkman yet.
Last night was terrible.
I kept wanting to...
get up and tell the captain
I'd made a horrible mistake,
and to turn the plane around.
My home is where you are, babe.
And if that means Jericho, Kansas
for the rest of my life,
it'll be a happy one.
I'm flying back tonight.
I get into Wichita at 10:30.
I can't think of anything
I'd rather see
than your beautiful face
when I get home.
And in case you're wondering, I...
I didn't go on that interview.
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, it's you.
Yeah, sorry, not ringing a bell.
Look, I have been standing out
here forever waiting for a cab.
Yeah, I suggest you nicely
ask someone for a ride.
Do you know where
the Richmond Farm is?
Well, yeah, I ought to.
I'm Stanley Richmond.
- You got to be kidding.
- No.
You see, now is the part
where you tell me your name.
Mimi Clark.
Really? Well, it's...
nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.
Do you not read your mail?
Nope. Nothing but bills
and bad news. Why?
Well, this would be a little of both.
I work for the IRS.
And according to our records,
you owe more than $180,000
in back taxes.
It's nice to meet you.
<i>Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.</i>
<i>We all know that
these divisions pale in comparison</i>
<i>to the fundamental dangers posed
by the thrt of terrorism.</i>
<i>We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world</i>
<i>a better place for our children
and grandchildren.</i>
<i>This has always been our promise.</i>
Not another step.
Where are my kids?
Give me the keys.
Darcy, put that gun down,
'cause you don't even
know how to use it.
I don't want to shoot you, Robert,
but so help me, I'm prepared to!
Now, give me the keys!
<i>Mom! Mom, come quick!</i>
Baby, stay outside!
<i>Mom! Mom!
Something's happening!</i>
<i>Woody, what are you looking at?</i>
Jake!
Jake, we got
to go outside!
Now!
<i>Help them.
Help them.</i>
Bring them inside.
Some of them were on planes.
Landed in the middle of nowhere.
Been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
<i>Can you give me
a hand with this?</i>
Oh, my God.
Roger.
Is it really you?
I thought you were dead.
Come on. Come with me.
We only have another half hour
before the generators shut down.
Well, I'm sure they'll
make an exception.
Do we have any extra blankets?
I already brought everything
down I could find. Listen, Eric,
these people need medical attention.
You have to find a doctor.
I'm okay.
Are there any more people out there?
We could send a search party.
21 men
and 32 women.
I'll do a head count.
What happened to you out there?
We waited in that field
for two days
after our plane went down.
No one came.
Eventually, I...
went for help.
I walked for...
I don't how long.
Wound up in this...
refugee camp.
Nebraska.
Most of us are from there.
I can't imagine
what you've seen out there.
Roger?
I said, I can't imagine
what you've seen.
Couldn't have
imagined it either.
Hey, wash up.
Dinner's almost ready.
Robert?
Darcy,
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while
until I can sort something out.
What does that mean?
It means you stay inside,
and you don't answer the door.
Here.
We're playing football.
Man, Sam,
that is really cool.
Daddy's gonna put that
on the fridge.
Sam, I want you to go upstairs,
tell your sister dinner's ready.
Okay? Right now.
<i>Allison!</i>
Are we in danger, Robert?
I've asked you that question
a thousand times,
you've always said no.
I don't...
mean to scare you, D.
All right, we'll do
whatever you say.
I trust you.
My God. Where did
they all come from?
I'm gonna need warm water,
as much as you can make.
I've made a list of the injured.
How's he doing?
I think he might be in shock.
He doesn't want to be treated
until everybody else
has been seen.
- Jake, I, um...
- Go.
He's gonna need you.
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>
<i>You need to keep them
clean and warm.</i>
Do you have a place to stay?
Do you know anyone
in Jericho?
Actually...
I do.
<i>Précédemment dans Jericho.</i>
Donc on va devenir des
associés maintenant.
Où as-tu entendu ça ?
Tu vas tenir l'épicerie,
tu vas avoir besoin de protection.
Ne fais pas la même erreur
que Gracie...
ou tous ces gens dehors
déposeront des fleurs
et des bougies sur ta tombe.
Qui c'est, bordel ?
Souviens-toi, le réservoir
est sur le côté gauche,
donc si quelqu'un décide
de te tirer dessus,
choisis le bon côté.
Ok. Autre chose ?
Bon, allons-nous te voir
pour Thanksgiving ?
Et bien, je pense que Mary et moi
allons le passer ensemble.
Tu seras toujours le bienvenu.
Merci, mais je ne veux pas vous
mettre en mauvaise position.
Tu aurais pu y penser avant
de partir avec ta maitresse
et de nous laisser ta femme.
Certains étaient en avion
et se sont posés au
milieu de nulle part.
Ils ont marché des semaines.
Ils ont du vivre l'enfer.
Oh, mon Dieu.
C'est toi ?
Garde les enfants à la maison
pour un moment
jusqu'à ce que j'ai fait le point.
- Sommes-nous en danger, Robert ?
Vous avez des engelures
sur vos orteils et vos doigts
Vous devez les garder
propres et au sec.
Avez-vous un endroit où aller ?
Connaissez-vous quelqu'un à Jericho ?
En fait...
Oui.
Ça caille aussi ici.
M. Bintner ?
M. Bintner ?
Joe ?
La température est tombée si vite.
Ça va être un long hiver.
Bien, s'il vous plaît !
Écoutez, s'il vous plaît !
S'il vous plaît !
En ce moment,
nous utilisons le générateur
pour alimenter la mairie
trois heures par jour,
et l'hôpital pendant six.
Voici la quantité d'essence
que nous avons...
Et voici ce dont nous avons besoin
pour passer l'hiver.
À cette allure,
nous n'aurons plus d'essence
dans deux semaines.
À quel moment vont sortir
les danceuses ?
Arrête.
Il y a une autre manière de faire
que d'effrayer tout le monde.
Il a été élu.
Il fait donc à sa manière.
J'ai besoin d'un passe-temps.
Voilà ce que nous allons faire.
Nous avons des équipes
pour le bois de chauffage...
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Oui.
Il y a une femme dans
le groupe de réfugiés
que Bill est en train de soigner.
Vous devriez lui parler.
Pourquoi ?
Elle dit qu'elle était
flic à Saint Louis.
Et particulièrement avec 53
nouveaux-venus parmis nous,
nous allons devoir tout repenser,
rapidement,
ou les décès de cette nuit
ne seront pas les seuls
de ce début d'hiver.
Et les éoliennes ?
Elle a raison.
La puissance du vent.
Nous devrions construire
des éoliennes.
Harry ?
Je pense que vous connaissez
tous Harry Carmichael,
notre ingénieur en chef
à la mine.
Nous recherchons des alternateurs depuis
des semaines avec le maire Green.
Mais nous avons besoin de temps
pour fabriquer ce qui nous manque.
Le temps est un luxe
qu'on ne peut s'offrir.
- Elle est là.
- Merci, Jimmy.
Salut, Rob.
Ils nous manque des pièces...
et nous n'avons pas les
machines nécessaires.
Quel genre de pièces ?
Des régulateurs mécaniques
pour la tension de sortie.
Suite aux dégâts de l'EMP,
nous devons tout reprendre de zéro.
- Ce sera fastidieux.
- Black Jack Fairgrounds.
Nous y sommes passés
en revenant ici.
C'est un comptoir d'échange.
Des gens venant de toutes
les régions échangent...
de la nourriture,
des informations,
des pièces mécaniques.
Ils ont peut-être ce qu'il faut.
C'est à plus de 300 Km.
C'est beaucoup d'essence pour
un "peut-être".
En faisant fonctionner
une éolienne...
nous économiserons
1 mois d'essence.
Si nous en avons assez,
nous pourrons nous passer d'essence.
Ça pourrait être une bonne idée
de former un groupe
pour aller vérifier.
Est-ce que quelqu'un
est volontaire ?

Je sais que c'était toi.
- Quoi?
- Ces hommes qui m'ont enlevée.
Ils ont dit que quelqu'un de
mon équipe nous avait vendus.
Ils ont dit que c'était toi.
Et tu les a crus ?
Je n'aurais pas dû ?
Tu es assez futée pour savoir
qu'ils diraient n'importe quoi
pour te faire parler.
Parce que tu sais
que je te confierais ma vie
autant que tu me confierais la tienne
et parce que tu...
Tu viens de me cogner,
sans que je réplique.
- Qui d'autre est ici ?
- Personne.
Victor s'est montré
juste après le Jour-J.
Mais juste pendant
quelques heures.
Tu l'as tué ?
Les radiations s'en sont chargées...
celles de Denver.
Personne d'autre n'est venu ici
au point de ralliement ?
Dis moi comment tu as fait
pour sortir de la pièce ?
Trois hommes armés...
des menottes.
Trois types et des menottes te
retiendraient dans une pièce ?
L'un d'eux était trop près.
Il n'en restait que deux.
Deux, c'est simple.
Après, j'ai roulé
aussi vite que possible.
J'ai vu les nuages de Washinton D.C.
et de Baltimore.
Je suis tombée en panne
d'essence à West Virginia.
Je suis allée de camp de réfugiés
en camp de réfugiés...
tant que j'ai pu.
Je suis content que tu
t'en sois sortie.
Tu m'as abandonnée.
Je sais.
Et maintenant ?
On a entendu parler de pilleurs
aux intersections, ici et là.
Mais si tu fais gaffe,
la route devrait être sûre
le reste du temps.
Une fois que tu seras à Black Jack,
surveille tes arrières.
Des voleurs ?
C'est plutôt des gardes
que tu dois te méfier.
Ils ont la réputation
d'être très brutal.
Sans la police ni
la garde nationnale,
c'est leur seul moyen de se
protéger et d'assurer
la continuité du commerce.
Tu ferais mieux de prendre deux
ou trois gars de la patrouille.
Juste pour éviter les
mauvaises surprises.
Je viens aussi.
N'y pense même pas.
Tu penses reconnaître un régulateur
pour une turbine en état de marche ?
Je n'emmène aucun
passager là dehors.
Jake, M. Carmichael a une famille.
Je peux aider.
Tu as besoin de moi.
Mme Green ?
Quoi ?
Eric m'a dit qu'April
était enceinte.
Je veux juste...
- S'il y a quoi que ce soit que je
puisse faire... - Mary...
Je pense que tu en as fait assez.
Il faut toujours que tu sois le premier
à te jeter dans la gueule du loup ?
Quelqu'un doit y aller.
Oui, il me semble que ce
quelqu'un, c'est toujours toi.
Gray a préparé quelques sacs de sel
pour que nous les troquions.
C'est pas bête.
Qui d'autre y va ?
Heather, apparemment.
Gray pense que je devrais emmener
deux gars de la patrouille.
C'est tout ?
Je ne suis pas sur que
réduire les patrouilles
pour qu'ils surveillent mes
arrières soit une bonne idée.
En plus, seule une poignée d'entre
eux savent ce qu'ils font.
Tu ne penses pas que je
puisse te surveiller ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu veux venir ?
Écoute, tu as déjà vu ce qu'il se
passe dehors, je veux juste...
le voir aussi de mes yeux.
D'un autre côté, je suis juste
chômeur, pas grabataire.
T'as demandé à Maman ?
Fiston, j'ai 59 ans.
J'étais maire de cette ville depuis
l'administration Carter.
Je suis un ancien Rangers de
l' US Army et un vétéran.
Bien sûr que je lui ai demandé.
Je pourrai descendre et...
chauffer de l'eau
pour ton bain.
Je ne pensais pas que je
pourrais le finir un jour.
Nous avons une invitée.
Je te présente Sarah.
Dale ?
Qu'est-ce que tu faisais
là-derrière ?
Un inventaire.
C'est si mal rangé ?
M. Houghton vient de m'apporter
la part de Melle Leigh.
- C'est quoi ces trucs ?
- Ouais, exactement.
T'as remarqué que c'était pourri ?
Ils m'arnaquent tous.
Personne ne respecte nos accords.
Mon père a l'habitude
de ce genre d'histoires
à la mine de sel.
- Et alors ? Comment il fait ?
- Il se contente...
de faire ce qu'il faut
pour que tout fonctionne.
Je ne mettrai pas
la clé sous la porte.
En fait,
il se peut que j'aie
de bonnes nouvelles à ce sujet.
Mais tu vas devoir
faire un petit voyage.
Il faut que je te parle.
Très bien.
J'aurais pas dû être si directe.
C'est vraiment bizarre.
Quoi ? Qu'est-ce qui est bizarre ?
Je t'ai embrassé.
Il y a un mois.
Et nous n'en avons pas parlé.
Les gens normaux en parlent
quand ça arrive.
Je vais...
Vous savez...
Je sais, je...
- Je suis vraiment désolé...
- Pas la peine de t'excuser.
Je ne suis pas en colêre.
Je comprends pourquoi c'est arrivé.
Écoute, je veux venir
car je pense pouvoir aider
cet endroit à se relever.
C'est tout.
C'est pas un rencard.
M. le Maire ?
Je ne suis plus maire, Dale.
Que veux-tu ?
Il faut que je vienne avec vous.
Je vais prendre ce que je peux.
Tout ce que je peux échanger pour
remettre cette boutique en état.
Ce que je n'utilise pas,
je le mettrai
à disposition de la ville.
Tu vas donner tout ça
pour la ville gratuitement ?
C'est ce qu'il y a de mieux, non ?
Je veux juste aider.
Et bien...
C'est une sacrée équipe
qu'on vient de rassembler.
Très bien.
On partira demain,
à la première heure.
Alors comme ça,
tu connais quelqu'un qui...
vient juste d'arriver en ville...
Regarde-moi.
Je ne veux pas te mentir.
Mais je...
Je ne peux pas t'en dire plus.
C'est une amie, d'accord ?
La dernière fois que t'as laissé
entrer quelqu'un de cette
- facette de ta vie, il y a 4 ans...
- C'est différent.
Tu ne pouvais pas
me dire qui il était.
Mais tu m'a demandé
de ne pas m'inquiéter.
2 semaines plus tard, t'es parti.
Je ne t'ai revu qu'il y a 2 mois.
C'est différent.
Sam a pleuré des semaines.
Il avait 4 ans.
Il ne comprenait pas
pourquoi tu voulais l'abandonner.
C'est juste que...
Je ne pense pas être capable
de le voir traverser ça à nouveau.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Approche.
C'est quoi ça ?
On m'observe.
Qui ça "on" ?
Je dirais...
Le Vieux.
Pourquoi... ?
T'as toujours le paquet,
n'est-ce pas ?
Il est le coordinateur
de tout ça depuis le début,
il nous donne les informations.
Pourquoi il se retournerait
contre nous ?
Je sais pas.
Tu peux toujours le contacter ?
Et tu lui...
as dit que tu m'avais retrouvé ?
- Pas encore.
- Alors fais le.
Fais le...
et on verra ce qu'il dit.
"Les voleurs seront pendus."
Donnez-nous vos armes.
Vous les reprendrez en sortant.
Allez-y.
Ils plaisantaient en disant
"pendus", hein ?
Pas au sens littéral du terme.
Tout le monde remplit une fiche
dans la tente principale.
Pour faire correspondre
les vendeurs et les acheteurs.
Ils m'ont donné 3 vendeurs potentiels
qui pourraient avoir
la pièce de l'éolienne.
C'est comme eBay.
Pas vraiment.
Bon, écoutez...
Essayez de trouver le régulateur,
je reste avec Dale.
Voyez ce qu'il veut échanger.
Faisons vite et on part d'ici.
Salut.
Bonjour.
Tu t'es endormi
en plein milieu de ta phrase.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Tu étais à l'évier,
en train de te raser.
Tu allais me raconter
ce que tu avais vu et...
Roger, je...
Je ne veux pas te brusquer.
Je ne peux pas imaginer
à quel point c'était horrible mais...
Et comment que ça l'était.
Écoute.
Si je te raconte,
tu me promets de ne pas penser...
que je suis cinglé ?
Bien sûr.
Dehors...
J'ai vu... quelque chose.
J'en ai parlé à personne, je...
J'arrive pas à l'expliquer.
Le fait est que...
c'était la plus belle chose
que j'ai jamais vue.
De là, j'ai atterri dans un campement
près de Lexington.
À quoi ils ressemblent ?
Les campements ?
Chacun est... différent.
Certains sont surpeuplés, dangereux.
D'autres sont un peu mieux.
Vous avez vu
des personnes irradiées ?
Certaines, oui.
À quoi elles ressemblent ?
Beaucoup de brulûres,
la peau qui tombe,
elles vomissent.
Allie, Sam.
Montez.
Comment vous connaissez mon père ?
On travaillait ensemble.
Vous savez jouer au football ?
Bien sûr !
Tout le monde sait, non ?
Pas tout le monde.
Samuel, tout de suite.
Viens.
Vous savez, ces enfants en ont
déjà vu bien assez.
Je suis désolée.
Écoutez, je ne vous connais pas.
Et j'en ai pas envie.
Je sais avec quel genre de personnes
travaille mon mari.
Je me fiche à quel point
vous êtes proches,
je n'ai pas besoin que mes enfants
soient exposés à tout ça.
Ça fait un moment que
je suis mariée à cet homme.
Je sais très bien
lire entre les lignes.
Merci, Mary.
Pourquoi on ne s'assiérait pas
pour boire un verre ?
Hé, combien ?
- Je vous demande pardon ?
- Combien ?
Combien pour quoi ?
Je sais pas...
Une heure ?
Une heure de quoi ?
Attendez, quoi ? Non !
- Alors une demi-heure ?
- Tout va bien ?
- Je suis pas une prostituée !
- Alors qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
C'est bon, ça suffit.
Ça suffit, mec.
- Y a un problème ?
- Non, non.
Aucun problème.
Tout va bien.
Sans déconner, mon pote.
Te crée pas d'ennuis avec les gardes,
ils s'énervent vite.
Merci du coup de main.
Heather.
Mon Dieu, Ted.
J'arrive pas à y croire.
Jake, je te présente Ted Lewis.
On a grandi ensemble
à New Bern.
Voici Russell et Mike.
On s'est déjà rencontrés.
J'étais inquiet pour toi.
On allait lancer une expédition
pour vous retrouver,
mais les routes sont dangereuses.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites là ?
On cherche des pièces pour
un régulateur d'éolienne.
Sans succès.
Il y a un type avec qui
on fait affaire...
qui ne cotoie pas trop
la tente principale,
et qui parfois possède
des objets spéciaux
très rares.
Vous voulez le voir ?
- Ouais, allons voir.
- D'accord.
Range-moi tout ça avant que
quelqu'un ne le voit.
Quest-ce qu'il y a de mal ?
Du niquel...
C'est un alliage avec de l'argent.
Et alors ?
Le niquel absorbe la radioactivité.
Ce qui provient des zones à risques
rend les gens malades.
Personne n'en veut.
Ça n'a pas été en contact
avec les pluies.
Écoute gamin,
si je peux pas, je peux pas.
Que veux-tu que je te dise ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as d'autre ?
Qu'est-ce qui a de la valeur ici ?
Rien de ce que vous avez.
Regardez sur le tableau là-bas.
Pourquoi le sel ?
C'est un conservateur.
Un antibiotique.
Il suffit d'1.5 g par jour
pour survivre.
Les Romains l'utilisaient
comme monnaie d'échange.
Beaucoup d'empires africains
dépendaient du contrôle
et des réserves de sel.
Des guerres ont été menées
pour le sel.
Nourriture, médicaments,
un générateur, parachutés,
en provenance de Chine.
Quoi ?
On a également eu un parachutage.
Par contre...
En provenance d'Allemagne.
C'est de l'aide.
Ça doit venir du monde entier.
Si on reçoit de l'aide
du monde entier, alors...
qui nous a fait ça ?
Des voyous, il y a quelques semaines,
des types se disant
employés du gouvernement.
Alors le maire a décidé de faire
de la sécurité une priorité.
Il a démissionné et...
a désigné le Shérif Constantino
comme gérant de la ville.
Ces types, c'était qui ?
Un détachement pour la sécurité
d'une...
compagnie appelée Ravenwood.
Ils sont venus chercher des réserves.
Certains commerçants ont résisté
et ils sont devenus violents.
Ils en ont tués 3, blessés 8.
Ils se sont enfuis
avec un camion plein de gasoil.
Mais depuis,
le shériff a réussi
à maintenir le calme.
Le crime n'est plus vraiment
un soucis pour nous.
Comment il a fait ?
- C'est quoi ?
- Les nouvelles.
D'où est-ce que ça vient ?
Les gens qui passent ici
viennent de partout.
Chacun apporte
sa petite pièce au puzzle.
T'as de quoi écrire ?
Vous ne sortez pas
beaucoup vous, hein ?
C'est pas tout.
C'est quoi les étoiles ?
Les capitales.
De quoi ?
Du gouvernement fédéral.
Le gouvernement fédéral ? Mais...
Il y a 6 étoiles.
Où est le président ?
Lequel ?
Six président, je...
Je comprends pas.
Qui dirige l'armée ?
Tu supposes qu'il n'y en a qu'une.
Allez, on y va.
Il n'existe pas une ligne de succession,
et donc un seul successeur ?
Le mot est précaire.
Le secrétaire Charles est censé
être le prochain,
mais il y a 5 autres types
qui semblent penser
que les attaques ont changé les règles.
Le sénateur Morrisette en Oregon,
le sénateur Tomarchio au Wyoming...
Ils ont tous des revendications,
pour réunir du monde.
Et ensuite ?
Comment ils décident qui est le chef ?
Soit il passent des accords,
- font des compromis...
- Ou ?
Ou ils se battent.
Six sachets de graines de soja,
et pourtant c'est...
C'est pas assez.
Peut-être que tout ça
était une mauvaise idée.
C'est un début.
Dale, attends.
Ça aurait été plus facile pour toi
de fermer la boutique, n'est-ce pas ?
Au lieu de ça, tu es là
et tu te bats.
Je pense que Gracie
serait fière de toi.
Et je pense que ta mère aussi.
Quand ma mère est morte,
je ne pouvais rien y faire.
Et ensuite Melle Leigh...
Mitchell Cafferty le paiera cher,
que Gray le trouve ou non.
Tôt ou tard, il croisera
la mauvaise personne.
Et ce jour-là,
ce sera fini pour lui.
Je n'aime pas boire
pendant que je travaille.
Pour être sincère,
j'ai du mal à comptabiliser
les choses pour lesquelles
je vous déteste.
Vous avez fait une liste ?
Mme Green, je ne pense pas que...
Ça ira mieux
si vous vous asseyez
et écoutez ce que je vais vous dire.
Ce que vous et Eric avez fait
à April était affreux.
Mais elle s'en sortira
car c'est une personne forte.
Mais il y a un bébé en jeu,
qui se trouve être mon petit-fils.
Et j'ai bien l'intention de faire
tout ce que je peux
pour le protéger de ce nouveau monde.
Mais je ne pourrai pas le protéger
de ce que vous avez fait.
Vous avez divisé ma famille.
Et bien que la vie de cet enfant
allait déjà être difficile,
vous avez aggravé les choses.
Je ne pense pas pouvoir
vous le pardonner.
Quand j'étais enfant, ma mère
nous a abandonnés, mon père et moi.
Pour un homme rencontré à Denver.
Ce n'est pas le sujet.
Ça ira mieux
si vous vous asseyez
et écoutez ce que je vais vous dire.
Je reste éveillée la nuit,
terrifiée d'avoir
mis April dans la même position
que l'était mon père.
Terrifiée d'avoir mis cet enfant
dans la même position que je l'ai été.
Mon erreur a été de tomber
amoureuse de votre fils,
je n'aurais jamais dû,
mais c'est arrivé.
J'en connais le prix.
Je sais à quel point c'est mal.
Mais le problème,
c'est qu'il m'aime aussi.
Et je ne sais pas ce que
vous allez y faire.
Alors si vous voulez continuer
à me détester,
si vous ne m'acceptez jamais...
je ne pourrais vous en vouloir.
Je suis parti chercher de l'aide.
J'étais plus fatigué
que je pensais.
J'ai erré des jours.
Finalement...
j'ai traversé ce... champ.
J'étais là,
au beau milieu du Nebraska,
me disant que c'était là
que j'allais mourir.
Et puis,
il est survenu une chose étrange.
Il y avait...
une lumière dans le ciel.
Une lumière éblouissante avec un...
un anneau autour.
Je...
me suis approché.
3 kms plus loin...
je suis tombé
sur un camp de réfugiés.
Cette lumière...
m'a sauvé la vie.
Je te cherchais partout.
T'as trouvé les pièces ?
Je pense.
T'as vu les nouvelles ?
Vous voulez échanger
un régulateur mécanique ?
Bien, alors parlons affaire.
8 sacs de sel de 15 kgs chacun.
Russell, qu'est-ce qu'ils croient ?
Qu'ils sont les premiers sur le coup ?
Ces pièces sont très demandées.
Je ne les donne pas.
- Il vous faut quoi d'autre ?
- Quoi d'autre ?
J'ai refusé à un mec ce matin,
et il offrait 300 litres de gasoil
en échange.
Écoutez...
On a plus de sel que
vous ne pouvez imaginer.
On a la plus grande exploitation
à 600 kms à la ronde
et on a les hommes pour creuser.
Mais si vous en voulez plus,
on doit conclure notre accord
maintenant, aujourd'hui.
Vous comprenez ?
Très bien,
je me porte garant pour lui.
D'accord ?
D'accord.
Marché conclu.
Attends ici.
Je vais les chercher.
Ces trucs sont pas faciles
à dénicher, vous savez.
Pas celles appropriées, tout du moins.
<i>Salut Papa, c'est Russel...</i>
M. le Maire ?
Arrête Dale, je ne suis
plus le Maire.
Il y a du sang dessus.
Tu veux que je t'aide là.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Vous êtes venus fouiller ou
faire des affaires ?
Non, on ne peut pas tolérer ça.
On trouvera une autre solution.
Alors on en a fini, c'est ça ?
Pourquoi vous ne partez pas ?
Sortez !
Vous aussi... dehors !
Désolé les gars.
On ne savait pas.
Il nous faut ces pièces.
- Et il faut qu'on trouve un moyen...
- Où est Dale ?
Dale, où t'étais passé ?
Ne t'éloigne pas comme ça.
Tu leur as piquée ?
C'est un salaud.
Il l'a bien mérité.
Il faut leur rendre ça avant
qu'ils s'en rendent compte.
Je suis sorti par derrière.
Personne ne m'a vu.
Attrapez-le !
Embarquez-le.
Il a fait une erreur, OK ?
Il va rendre ce qu'il a pris.
Il n'y a rien de grave...
d'accord ?
Excusez-moi.
Vous savez...
il est vraiment désolé et,
vous avez récupéré votre matériel.
Il va expliquer ça
à nos dirigeants.
Allez-y doucement, c'est tout
ce que je vous demande.
Excusez-moi, mais je pourrais
parler à un responsable ?
Écoute le vieux, je t'ai dit...
Ça suffit !
Vous avez bossé longtemps
pour le FBI ?
14 ans.
J'ai commencé juste après la fac.
Ça craint dehors, non ?
Je pense pas que ta mère
apprécie qu'on parle de ça.
Je ne suis plus une gamine.
C'est plutôt dommage.
Mon père m'a appris à tirer.
Ça a sûrement contribué.
Il t'a appris à tirer ?
Un peu.
Je n'aime pas vraiment ça.
C'est une sensation bizarre...
mais c'est une des rares choses
que nous ayons faites ensemble.
Où est ton père ?
C'est Le Vieux.
<i>"Retrouvez le colis. Tuez votre contact"</i>
Il veut nous monter
l'un contre l'autre.
Il sait où tu es.
Il faut qu'on parte.
Maintenant.
Non, je ne pense pas.
Tu ne penses pas ?
Nous avons bouleversé
la face du monde.
Seule une poignée de gens
partagent notre secret.
On doit continuer à se battre,
et rester en vie.
On va le voir,
et s'il est derrière tout ça,
on se débarrasse de lui.
On s'en débarasse ?
Oui, on ne peut pas se
sauver indéfiniment.
Ma famille... ne peut pas
se cacher éternellement.
On lui rend une petite visite...
et on élimine toute menace.
Si on y va directement,
on risque de ne pas s'en sortir.
Tu t'en vas.
Je m'en suis doutée dès
qu'elle a franchi notre porte.
Tu n'as pas de raison
de t'en faire.
Ce n'est pas pour moi
que je me soucie.
Nos enfants ont besoin d'un père.
Quoique tu doives faire, ça ne peut
pas être plus important que ça.
Tu lui fais confiance ?
Je n'ai pas le choix.
Si elle devient une menace
pour notre famille...
si elle te met en danger...
tue-la.
Tu m'entends ?
Montez !
Vite !
Arrête-toi.
Jake, on ne passera pas en force.
Arrête-toi maintenant !
Merci. Je...
On ne s'en serait pas sortis
sans vous, les gars.
- Vous nous le rendrez un jour.
- Si on peut vous aider...
Je pensais... à ces éoliennes
que vous voulez construire.
Les types de l'ancienne usine...
ils pourraient transformer
une partie de leur atelier,
et vous aider.
En plus, la ville a besoin de sel.
Il semblerait qu'on soit
appelés à se revoir.
- Merci encore les gars. Faites gaffe.
- Merci pour tout.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Jake, j'ai vu le régulateur.
J'ai vu comment il est assemblé.
J'ai parlé à Ted,
et je pense qu'à nous deux,
on peut tirer beaucoup d'eux.
Mais je dois rester avec lui.
- Avec eux ? Attends...
- Non, réfléchis.
On n'a pas les équipements
nécessaires.
Ils ont des machines...
et des gens qui savent
s'en servir.
Avec une douzaine d'éoliennes,
on peut alimenter la ville entière...
relancer le centre médical,
se passer de carburant.
Tu vas nous quitter ?
Comme ça ?
Pas pour longtemps.
Quelques jours seulement.
Ça peut nous rendre service.
Je dois essayer.
Tu penses que c'est
une bonne idée ?
Tu sais pourquoi ça n'a
pas marché entre nous ?
Je suis trop casanière.
J'aime les mots-croisés,
les pyjamas en flanelle et
à l'occasion, une bière light.
Je ne prends aucun risque.
- C'est pour ça que tu hésites.
- Mais non.
Bien sûr que si.
Mais c'est pas grave.
Si ça l'était, ton père serait
probablement mort à l'heure qu'il est,
et on ne se serait jamais
rencontrés dans ce bus.
On va tourner une page,
je vais oublier mes hésitations.
Je vais faire en sorte de ramener
la lumière dans nos foyers.
Juste quelques jours.
Tu t'inquiètes pour moi ?
Reviens entière.
Papa ?
On n'a plus de dentifrice.
Ah bon, alors voila...
ce que M. Daley a fait.
- C'est pas du dentifrice.
- Si, c'en est.
Tu te moques de moi ?
Tu sais...
quand tes dents ont poussées,
tu n'as jamais pleuré.
Tu vois, la plupart des bébés
pleurent, mais pas toi.
Et ta...
mère s'inquiétait, et...
les docteurs s'inquiétaient,
mais pas moi.
Parce que je savais que
tu n'étais pas malade,
que tu n'avais pas mal,
mais que tu étais courageux.
Parce que tu es le garçon le plus
courageux que je connaisse.
Tu l'as toujours été.
Papa ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Sam,
je dois aller travailler demain.
J'ai un rendez-vous important,
assez loin d'ici.
Je ne reviendrais pas
avant un jour ou deux,
je voulais juste que tu le saches.
Tu en as assez de moi ?
Quoi ?
Tu t'en vas.
Écoute-moi bien.
Il n'y a rien que
toi, ta soeur ou ta mère
puissiez faire qui m'oblige
à vous quitter.
Je...
Je t'aime.
Tu comprends, hein ?
<i>"Sois gentille.
Elle sera de la famille bientôt."</i>
Bienvenue à la maison.
Ça s'est bien passé ?
- Vous avez les pièces ?
- On les avait...
et on les a perdues.
Où est Heather ?
Elle rallume les lumières.
Tu es conscient que ce qui
est arrivé aujourd'hui
était inutile ?
Et stupide ?
Tu as des responsabilités
maintenant.
Tu devrais plus réfléchir
à ce que tu fais.
J'ai compris.
Et toi... tu savais que la voiture
ne passerait pas au
travers de cette grille ?
Je sais.
Je t'ai entendu,
et je savais que tu avais raison.
Pourquoi tu ne t'es pas arrêté ?
Je sais pas.
Qu'est-ce que t'as récupéré ?
Regarde-moi tout ça.
Tu t'es bien débrouillé.
C'est rien.
Skylar, ta famille possède une
grande partie de la mine ?
Je ne sais pas.
Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'elle pourrait
nous rendre riches.
Ça va ?
Écoute...
Je suis content que tu
t'en sois sortie.
On part demain matin,
à la première heure.
<i>"As-tu localisé le paquet ?"</i>
<i>"As-tu localisé le paquet ?"
" Pas encore."</i>
<i>"Comment fait-on ?"</i>
<i>"On se sert de sa famille."</i>
[ www.seriessub.com ]
<i>Précédemment dans Jericho.</i>
Donc on va devenir des
associés maintenant.
Où as-tu entendu ça ?
Tu vas tenir l'épicerie,
tu vas avoir besoin de protection.
Ne fais pas la même erreur
que Gracie...
ou tous ces gens dehors
déposeront des fleurs
et des bougies sur ta tombe.
Qui c'est, bordel ?
Souviens-toi, le réservoir
est sur le côté gauche,
donc si quelqu'un décide
de te tirer dessus,
choisis le bon côté.
Ok. Autre chose ?
Bon, allons-nous te voir
pour Thanksgiving ?
Et bien, je pense que Mary et moi
allons le passer ensemble.
Tu seras toujours le bienvenu.
Merci, mais je ne veux pas vous
mettre en mauvaise position.
Tu aurais pu y penser avant
de partir avec ta maitresse
et de nous laisser ta femme.
Certains étaient en avion
et se sont posés au
milieu de nulle part.
Ils ont marché des semaines.
Ils ont du vivre l'enfer.
Oh, mon Dieu.
C'est toi ?
Garde les enfants à la maison
pour un moment
jusqu'à ce que j'ai fait le point.
- Sommes-nous en danger, Robert ?
Vous avez des engelures
sur vos orteils et vos doigts
Vous devez les garder
propres et au sec.
Avez-vous un endroit où aller ?
Connaissez-vous quelqu'un à Jericho ?
En fait...
Oui.
Ça caille aussi ici.
M. Bintner ?
M. Bintner ?
Joe ?
La température est tombée si vite.
Ça va être un long hiver.
Bien, s'il vous plaît !
Écoutez, s'il vous plaît !
S'il vous plaît !
En ce moment,
nous utilisons le générateur
pour alimenter la mairie
trois heures par jour,
et l'hôpital pendant six.
Voici la quantité d'essence
que nous avons...
Et voici ce dont nous avons besoin
pour passer l'hiver.
À cette allure,
nous n'aurons plus d'essence
dans deux semaines.
À quel moment vont sortir
les danceuses ?
Arrête.
Il y a une autre manière de faire
que d'effrayer tout le monde.
Il a été élu.
Il fait donc à sa manière.
J'ai besoin d'un passe-temps.
Voilà ce que nous allons faire.
Nous avons des équipes
pour le bois de chauffage...
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Oui.
Il y a une femme dans
le groupe de réfugiés
que Bill est en train de soigner.
Vous devriez lui parler.
Pourquoi ?
Elle dit qu'elle était
flic à Saint Louis.
Et particulièrement avec 53
nouveaux-venus parmis nous,
nous allons devoir tout repenser,
rapidement,
ou les décès de cette nuit
ne seront pas les seuls
de ce début d'hiver.
Et les éoliennes ?
Elle a raison.
La puissance du vent.
Nous devrions construire
des éoliennes.
Harry ?
Je pense que vous connaissez
tous Harry Carmichael,
notre ingénieur en chef
à la mine.
Nous recherchons des alternateurs depuis
des semaines avec le maire Green.
Mais nous avons besoin de temps
pour fabriquer ce qui nous manque.
Le temps est un luxe
qu'on ne peut s'offrir.
- Elle est là.
- Merci, Jimmy.
Salut, Rob.
Ils nous manque des pièces...
et nous n'avons pas les
machines nécessaires.
Quel genre de pièces ?
Des régulateurs mécaniques
pour la tension de sortie.
Suite aux dégâts de l'EMP,
nous devons tout reprendre de zéro.
- Ce sera fastidieux.
- Black Jack Fairgrounds.
Nous y sommes passés
en revenant ici.
C'est un comptoir d'échange.
Des gens venant de toutes
les régions échangent...
de la nourriture,
des informations,
des pièces mécaniques.
Ils ont peut-être ce qu'il faut.
C'est à plus de 300 Km.
C'est beaucoup d'essence pour
un "peut-être".
En faisant fonctionner
une éolienne...
nous économiserons
1 mois d'essence.
Si nous en avons assez,
nous pourrons nous passer d'essence.
Ça pourrait être une bonne idée
de former un groupe
pour aller vérifier.
Est-ce que quelqu'un
est volontaire ?

Je sais que c'était toi.
- Quoi?
- Ces hommes qui m'ont enlevée.
Ils ont dit que quelqu'un de
mon équipe nous avait vendus.
Ils ont dit que c'était toi.
Et tu les a crus ?
Je n'aurais pas dû ?
Tu es assez futée pour savoir
qu'ils diraient n'importe quoi
pour te faire parler.
Parce que tu sais
que je te confierais ma vie
autant que tu me confierais la tienne
et parce que tu...
Tu viens de me cogner,
sans que je réplique.
- Qui d'autre est ici ?
- Personne.
Victor s'est montré
juste après le Jour-J.
Mais juste pendant
quelques heures.
Tu l'as tué ?
Les radiations s'en sont chargées...
celles de Denver.
Personne d'autre n'est venu ici
au point de ralliement ?
Dis moi comment tu as fait
pour sortir de la pièce ?
Trois hommes armés...
des menottes.
Trois types et des menottes te
retiendraient dans une pièce ?
L'un d'eux était trop près.
Il n'en restait que deux.
Deux, c'est simple.
Après, j'ai roulé
aussi vite que possible.
J'ai vu les nuages de Washinton D.C.
et de Baltimore.
Je suis tombée en panne
d'essence à West Virginia.
Je suis allée de camp de réfugiés
en camp de réfugiés...
tant que j'ai pu.
Je suis content que tu
t'en sois sortie.
Tu m'as abandonnée.
Je sais.
Et maintenant ?
On a entendu parler de pilleurs
aux intersections, ici et là.
Mais si tu fais gaffe,
la route devrait être sûre
le reste du temps.
Une fois que tu seras à Black Jack,
surveille tes arrières.
Des voleurs ?
C'est plutôt des gardes
que tu dois te méfier.
Ils ont la réputation
d'être très brutal.
Sans la police ni
la garde nationnale,
c'est leur seul moyen de se
protéger et d'assurer
la continuité du commerce.
Tu ferais mieux de prendre deux
ou trois gars de la patrouille.
Juste pour éviter les
mauvaises surprises.
Je viens aussi.
N'y pense même pas.
Tu penses reconnaître un régulateur
pour une turbine en état de marche ?
Je n'emmène aucun
passager là dehors.
Jake, M. Carmichael a une famille.
Je peux aider.
Tu as besoin de moi.
Mme Green ?
Quoi ?
Eric m'a dit qu'April
était enceinte.
Je veux juste...
- S'il y a quoi que ce soit que je
puisse faire... - Mary...
Je pense que tu en as fait assez.
Il faut toujours que tu sois le premier
à te jeter dans la gueule du loup ?
Quelqu'un doit y aller.
Oui, il me semble que ce
quelqu'un, c'est toujours toi.
Gray a préparé quelques sacs de sel
pour que nous les troquions.
C'est pas bête.
Qui d'autre y va ?
Heather, apparemment.
Gray pense que je devrais emmener
deux gars de la patrouille.
C'est tout ?
Je ne suis pas sur que
réduire les patrouilles
pour qu'ils surveillent mes
arrières soit une bonne idée.
En plus, seule une poignée d'entre
eux savent ce qu'ils font.
Tu ne penses pas que je
puisse te surveiller ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu veux venir ?
Écoute, tu as déjà vu ce qu'il se
passe dehors, je veux juste...
le voir aussi de mes yeux.
D'un autre côté, je suis juste
chômeur, pas grabataire.
T'as demandé à Maman ?
Fiston, j'ai 59 ans.
J'étais maire de cette ville depuis
l'administration Carter.
Je suis un ancien Rangers de
l' US Army et un vétéran.
Bien sûr que je lui ai demandé.
Je pourrai descendre et...
chauffer de l'eau
pour ton bain.
Je ne pensais pas que je
pourrais le finir un jour.
Nous avons une invitée.
Je te présente Sarah.
Dale ?
Qu'est-ce que tu faisais
là-derrière ?
Un inventaire.
C'est si mal rangé ?
M. Houghton vient de m'apporter
la part de Melle Leigh.
- C'est quoi ces trucs ?
- Ouais, exactement.
T'as remarqué que c'était pourri ?
Ils m'arnaquent tous.
Personne ne respecte nos accords.
Mon père a l'habitude
de ce genre d'histoires
à la mine de sel.
- Et alors ? Comment il fait ?
- Il se contente...
de faire ce qu'il faut
pour que tout fonctionne.
Je ne mettrai pas
la clé sous la porte.
En fait,
il se peut que j'aie
de bonnes nouvelles à ce sujet.
Mais tu vas devoir
faire un petit voyage.
Il faut que je te parle.
Très bien.
J'aurais pas dû être si directe.
C'est vraiment bizarre.
Quoi ? Qu'est-ce qui est bizarre ?
Je t'ai embrassé.
Il y a un mois.
Et nous n'en avons pas parlé.
Les gens normaux en parlent
quand ça arrive.
Je vais...
Vous savez...
Je sais, je...
- Je suis vraiment désolé...
- Pas la peine de t'excuser.
Je ne suis pas en colêre.
Je comprends pourquoi c'est arrivé.
Écoute, je veux venir
car je pense pouvoir aider
cet endroit à se relever.
C'est tout.
C'est pas un rencard.
M. le Maire ?
Je ne suis plus maire, Dale.
Que veux-tu ?
Il faut que je vienne avec vous.
Je vais prendre ce que je peux.
Tout ce que je peux échanger pour
remettre cette boutique en état.
Ce que je n'utilise pas,
je le mettrai
à disposition de la ville.
Tu vas donner tout ça
pour la ville gratuitement ?
C'est ce qu'il y a de mieux, non ?
Je veux juste aider.
Et bien...
C'est une sacrée équipe
qu'on vient de rassembler.
Très bien.
On partira demain,
à la première heure.
Alors comme ça,
tu connais quelqu'un qui...
vient juste d'arriver en ville...
Regarde-moi.
Je ne veux pas te mentir.
Mais je...
Je ne peux pas t'en dire plus.
C'est une amie, d'accord ?
La dernière fois que t'as laissé
entrer quelqu'un de cette
- facette de ta vie, il y a 4 ans...
- C'est différent.
Tu ne pouvais pas
me dire qui il était.
Mais tu m'a demandé
de ne pas m'inquiéter.
2 semaines plus tard, t'es parti.
Je ne t'ai revu qu'il y a 2 mois.
C'est différent.
Sam a pleuré des semaines.
Il avait 4 ans.
Il ne comprenait pas
pourquoi tu voulais l'abandonner.
C'est juste que...
Je ne pense pas être capable
de le voir traverser ça à nouveau.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Approche.
C'est quoi ça ?
On m'observe.
Qui ça "on" ?
Je dirais...
Le Vieux.
Pourquoi... ?
T'as toujours le paquet,
n'est-ce pas ?
Il est le coordinateur
de tout ça depuis le début,
il nous donne les informations.
Pourquoi il se retournerait
contre nous ?
Je sais pas.
Tu peux toujours le contacter ?
Et tu lui...
as dit que tu m'avais retrouvé ?
- Pas encore.
- Alors fais le.
Fais le...
et on verra ce qu'il dit.
"Les voleurs seront pendus."
Donnez-nous vos armes.
Vous les reprendrez en sortant.
Allez-y.
Ils plaisantaient en disant
"pendus", hein ?
Pas au sens littéral du terme.
Tout le monde remplit une fiche
dans la tente principale.
Pour faire correspondre
les vendeurs et les acheteurs.
Ils m'ont donné 3 vendeurs potentiels
qui pourraient avoir
la pièce de l'éolienne.
C'est comme eBay.
Pas vraiment.
Bon, écoutez...
Essayez de trouver le régulateur,
je reste avec Dale.
Voyez ce qu'il veut échanger.
Faisons vite et on part d'ici.
Salut.
Bonjour.
Tu t'es endormi
en plein milieu de ta phrase.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Tu étais à l'évier,
en train de te raser.
Tu allais me raconter
ce que tu avais vu et...
Roger, je...
Je ne veux pas te brusquer.
Je ne peux pas imaginer
à quel point c'était horrible mais...
Et comment que ça l'était.
Écoute.
Si je te raconte,
tu me promets de ne pas penser...
que je suis cinglé ?
Bien sûr.
Dehors...
J'ai vu... quelque chose.
J'en ai parlé à personne, je...
J'arrive pas à l'expliquer.
Le fait est que...
c'était la plus belle chose
que j'ai jamais vue.
De là, j'ai atterri dans un campement
près de Lexington.
À quoi ils ressemblent ?
Les campements ?
Chacun est... différent.
Certains sont surpeuplés, dangereux.
D'autres sont un peu mieux.
Vous avez vu
des personnes irradiées ?
Certaines, oui.
À quoi elles ressemblent ?
Beaucoup de brulûres,
la peau qui tombe,
elles vomissent.
Allie, Sam.
Montez.
Comment vous connaissez mon père ?
On travaillait ensemble.
Vous savez jouer au football ?
Bien sûr !
Tout le monde sait, non ?
Pas tout le monde.
Samuel, tout de suite.
Viens.
Vous savez, ces enfants en ont
déjà vu bien assez.
Je suis désolée.
Écoutez, je ne vous connais pas.
Et j'en ai pas envie.
Je sais avec quel genre de personnes
travaille mon mari.
Je me fiche à quel point
vous êtes proches,
je n'ai pas besoin que mes enfants
soient exposés à tout ça.
Ça fait un moment que
je suis mariée à cet homme.
Je sais très bien
lire entre les lignes.
Merci, Mary.
Pourquoi on ne s'assiérait pas
pour boire un verre ?
Hé, combien ?
- Je vous demande pardon ?
- Combien ?
Combien pour quoi ?
Je sais pas...
Une heure ?
Une heure de quoi ?
Attendez, quoi ? Non !
- Alors une demi-heure ?
- Tout va bien ?
- Je suis pas une prostituée !
- Alors qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
C'est bon, ça suffit.
Ça suffit, mec.
- Y a un problème ?
- Non, non.
Aucun problème.
Tout va bien.
Sans déconner, mon pote.
Te crée pas d'ennuis avec les gardes,
ils s'énervent vite.
Merci du coup de main.
Heather.
Mon Dieu, Ted.
J'arrive pas à y croire.
Jake, je te présente Ted Lewis.
On a grandi ensemble
à New Bern.
Voici Russell et Mike.
On s'est déjà rencontrés.
J'étais inquiet pour toi.
On allait lancer une expédition
pour vous retrouver,
mais les routes sont dangereuses.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites là ?
On cherche des pièces pour
un régulateur d'éolienne.
Sans succès.
Il y a un type avec qui
on fait affaire...
qui ne cotoie pas trop
la tente principale,
et qui parfois possède
des objets spéciaux
très rares.
Vous voulez le voir ?
- Ouais, allons voir.
- D'accord.
Range-moi tout ça avant que
quelqu'un ne le voit.
Quest-ce qu'il y a de mal ?
Du niquel...
C'est un alliage avec de l'argent.
Et alors ?
Le niquel absorbe la radioactivité.
Ce qui provient des zones à risques
rend les gens malades.
Personne n'en veut.
Ça n'a pas été en contact
avec les pluies.
Écoute gamin,
si je peux pas, je peux pas.
Que veux-tu que je te dise ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as d'autre ?
Qu'est-ce qui a de la valeur ici ?
Rien de ce que vous avez.
Regardez sur le tableau là-bas.
Pourquoi le sel ?
C'est un conservateur.
Un antibiotique.
Il suffit d'1.5 g par jour
pour survivre.
Les Romains l'utilisaient
comme monnaie d'échange.
Beaucoup d'empires africains
dépendaient du contrôle
et des réserves de sel.
Des guerres ont été menées
pour le sel.
Nourriture, médicaments,
un générateur, parachutés,
en provenance de Chine.
Quoi ?
On a également eu un parachutage.
Par contre...
En provenance d'Allemagne.
C'est de l'aide.
Ça doit venir du monde entier.
Si on reçoit de l'aide
du monde entier, alors...
qui nous a fait ça ?
Des voyous, il y a quelques semaines,
des types se disant
employés du gouvernement.
Alors le maire a décidé de faire
de la sécurité une priorité.
Il a démissionné et...
a désigné le Shérif Constantino
comme gérant de la ville.
Ces types, c'était qui ?
Un détachement pour la sécurité
d'une...
compagnie appelée Ravenwood.
Ils sont venus chercher des réserves.
Certains commerçants ont résisté
et ils sont devenus violents.
Ils en ont tués 3, blessés 8.
Ils se sont enfuis
avec un camion plein de gasoil.
Mais depuis,
le shériff a réussi
à maintenir le calme.
Le crime n'est plus vraiment
un soucis pour nous.
Comment il a fait ?
- C'est quoi ?
- Les nouvelles.
D'où est-ce que ça vient ?
Les gens qui passent ici
viennent de partout.
Chacun apporte
sa petite pièce au puzzle.
T'as de quoi écrire ?
Vous ne sortez pas
beaucoup vous, hein ?
C'est pas tout.
C'est quoi les étoiles ?
Les capitales.
De quoi ?
Du gouvernement fédéral.
Le gouvernement fédéral ? Mais...
Il y a 6 étoiles.
Où est le président ?
Lequel ?
Six président, je...
Je comprends pas.
Qui dirige l'armée ?
Tu supposes qu'il n'y en a qu'une.
Allez, on y va.
Il n'existe pas une ligne de succession,
et donc un seul successeur ?
Le mot est précaire.
Le secrétaire Charles est censé
être le prochain,
mais il y a 5 autres types
qui semblent penser
que les attaques ont changé les règles.
Le sénateur Morrisette en Oregon,
le sénateur Tomarchio au Wyoming...
Ils ont tous des revendications,
pour réunir du monde.
Et ensuite ?
Comment ils décident qui est le chef ?
Soit il passent des accords,
- font des compromis...
- Ou ?
Ou ils se battent.
Six sachets de graines de soja,
et pourtant c'est...
C'est pas assez.
Peut-être que tout ça
était une mauvaise idée.
C'est un début.
Dale, attends.
Ça aurait été plus facile pour toi
de fermer la boutique, n'est-ce pas ?
Au lieu de ça, tu es là
et tu te bats.
Je pense que Gracie
serait fière de toi.
Et je pense que ta mère aussi.
Quand ma mère est morte,
je ne pouvais rien y faire.
Et ensuite Melle Leigh...
Mitchell Cafferty le paiera cher,
que Gray le trouve ou non.
Tôt ou tard, il croisera
la mauvaise personne.
Et ce jour-là,
ce sera fini pour lui.
Je n'aime pas boire
pendant que je travaille.
Pour être sincère,
j'ai du mal à comptabiliser
les choses pour lesquelles
je vous déteste.
Vous avez fait une liste ?
Mme Green, je ne pense pas que...
Ça ira mieux
si vous vous asseyez
et écoutez ce que je vais vous dire.
Ce que vous et Eric avez fait
à April était affreux.
Mais elle s'en sortira
car c'est une personne forte.
Mais il y a un bébé en jeu,
qui se trouve être mon petit-fils.
Et j'ai bien l'intention de faire
tout ce que je peux
pour le protéger de ce nouveau monde.
Mais je ne pourrai pas le protéger
de ce que vous avez fait.
Vous avez divisé ma famille.
Et bien que la vie de cet enfant
allait déjà être difficile,
vous avez aggravé les choses.
Je ne pense pas pouvoir
vous le pardonner.
Quand j'étais enfant, ma mère
nous a abandonnés, mon père et moi.
Pour un homme rencontré à Denver.
Ce n'est pas le sujet.
Ça ira mieux
si vous vous asseyez
et écoutez ce que je vais vous dire.
Je reste éveillée la nuit,
terrifiée d'avoir
mis April dans la même position
que l'était mon père.
Terrifiée d'avoir mis cet enfant
dans la même position que je l'ai été.
Mon erreur a été de tomber
amoureuse de votre fils,
je n'aurais jamais dû,
mais c'est arrivé.
J'en connais le prix.
Je sais à quel point c'est mal.
Mais le problème,
c'est qu'il m'aime aussi.
Et je ne sais pas ce que
vous allez y faire.
Alors si vous voulez continuer
à me détester,
si vous ne m'acceptez jamais...
je ne pourrais vous en vouloir.
Je suis parti chercher de l'aide.
J'étais plus fatigué
que je pensais.
J'ai erré des jours.
Finalement...
j'ai traversé ce... champ.
J'étais là,
au beau milieu du Nebraska,
me disant que c'était là
que j'allais mourir.
Et puis,
il est survenu une chose étrange.
Il y avait...
une lumière dans le ciel.
Une lumière éblouissante avec un...
un anneau autour.
Je...
me suis approché.
3 kms plus loin...
je suis tombé
sur un camp de réfugiés.
Cette lumière...
m'a sauvé la vie.
Je te cherchais partout.
T'as trouvé les pièces ?
Je pense.
T'as vu les nouvelles ?
Vous voulez échanger
un régulateur mécanique ?
Bien, alors parlons affaire.
8 sacs de sel de 15 kgs chacun.
Russell, qu'est-ce qu'ils croient ?
Qu'ils sont les premiers sur le coup ?
Ces pièces sont très demandées.
Je ne les donne pas.
- Il vous faut quoi d'autre ?
- Quoi d'autre ?
J'ai refusé à un mec ce matin,
et il offrait 300 litres de gasoil
en échange.
Écoutez...
On a plus de sel que
vous ne pouvez imaginer.
On a la plus grande exploitation
à 600 kms à la ronde
et on a les hommes pour creuser.
Mais si vous en voulez plus,
on doit conclure notre accord
maintenant, aujourd'hui.
Vous comprenez ?
Très bien,
je me porte garant pour lui.
D'accord ?
D'accord.
Marché conclu.
Attends ici.
Je vais les chercher.
Ces trucs sont pas faciles
à dénicher, vous savez.
Pas celles appropriées, tout du moins.
<i>Salut Papa, c'est Russel...</i>
M. le Maire ?
Arrête Dale, je ne suis
plus le Maire.
Il y a du sang dessus.
Tu veux que je t'aide là.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Vous êtes venus fouiller ou
faire des affaires ?
Non, on ne peut pas tolérer ça.
On trouvera une autre solution.
Alors on en a fini, c'est ça ?
Pourquoi vous ne partez pas ?
Sortez !
Vous aussi... dehors !
Désolé les gars.
On ne savait pas.
Il nous faut ces pièces.
- Et il faut qu'on trouve un moyen...
- Où est Dale ?
Dale, où t'étais passé ?
Ne t'éloigne pas comme ça.
Tu leur as piquée ?
C'est un salaud.
Il l'a bien mérité.
Il faut leur rendre ça avant
qu'ils s'en rendent compte.
Je suis sorti par derrière.
Personne ne m'a vu.
Attrapez-le !
Embarquez-le.
Il a fait une erreur, OK ?
Il va rendre ce qu'il a pris.
Il n'y a rien de grave...
d'accord ?
Excusez-moi.
Vous savez...
il est vraiment désolé et,
vous avez récupéré votre matériel.
Il va expliquer ça
à nos dirigeants.
Allez-y doucement, c'est tout
ce que je vous demande.
Excusez-moi, mais je pourrais
parler à un responsable ?
Écoute le vieux, je t'ai dit...
Ça suffit !
Vous avez bossé longtemps
pour le FBI ?
14 ans.
J'ai commencé juste après la fac.
Ça craint dehors, non ?
Je pense pas que ta mère
apprécie qu'on parle de ça.
Je ne suis plus une gamine.
C'est plutôt dommage.
Mon père m'a appris à tirer.
Ça a sûrement contribué.
Il t'a appris à tirer ?
Un peu.
Je n'aime pas vraiment ça.
C'est une sensation bizarre...
mais c'est une des rares choses
que nous ayons faites ensemble.
Où est ton père ?
C'est Le Vieux.
<i>"Retrouvez le colis. Tuez votre contact"</i>
Il veut nous monter
l'un contre l'autre.
Il sait où tu es.
Il faut qu'on parte.
Maintenant.
Non, je ne pense pas.
Tu ne penses pas ?
Nous avons bouleversé
la face du monde.
Seule une poignée de gens
partagent notre secret.
On doit continuer à se battre,
et rester en vie.
On va le voir,
et s'il est derrière tout ça,
on se débarrasse de lui.
On s'en débarasse ?
Oui, on ne peut pas se
sauver indéfiniment.
Ma famille... ne peut pas
se cacher éternellement.
On lui rend une petite visite...
et on élimine toute menace.
Si on y va directement,
on risque de ne pas s'en sortir.
Tu t'en vas.
Je m'en suis doutée dès
qu'elle a franchi notre porte.
Tu n'as pas de raison
de t'en faire.
Ce n'est pas pour moi
que je me soucie.
Nos enfants ont besoin d'un père.
Quoique tu doives faire, ça ne peut
pas être plus important que ça.
Tu lui fais confiance ?
Je n'ai pas le choix.
Si elle devient une menace
pour notre famille...
si elle te met en danger...
tue-la.
Tu m'entends ?
Montez !
Vite !
Arrête-toi.
Jake, on ne passera pas en force.
Arrête-toi maintenant !
Merci. Je...
On ne s'en serait pas sortis
sans vous, les gars.
- Vous nous le rendrez un jour.
- Si on peut vous aider...
Je pensais... à ces éoliennes
que vous voulez construire.
Les types de l'ancienne usine...
ils pourraient transformer
une partie de leur atelier,
et vous aider.
En plus, la ville a besoin de sel.
Il semblerait qu'on soit
appelés à se revoir.
- Merci encore les gars. Faites gaffe.
- Merci pour tout.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Jake, j'ai vu le régulateur.
J'ai vu comment il est assemblé.
J'ai parlé à Ted,
et je pense qu'à nous deux,
on peut tirer beaucoup d'eux.
Mais je dois rester avec lui.
- Avec eux ? Attends...
- Non, réfléchis.
On n'a pas les équipements
nécessaires.
Ils ont des machines...
et des gens qui savent
s'en servir.
Avec une douzaine d'éoliennes,
on peut alimenter la ville entière...
relancer le centre médical,
se passer de carburant.
Tu vas nous quitter ?
Comme ça ?
Pas pour longtemps.
Quelques jours seulement.
Ça peut nous rendre service.
Je dois essayer.
Tu penses que c'est
une bonne idée ?
Tu sais pourquoi ça n'a
pas marché entre nous ?
Je suis trop casanière.
J'aime les mots-croisés,
les pyjamas en flanelle et
à l'occasion, une bière light.
Je ne prends aucun risque.
- C'est pour ça que tu hésites.
- Mais non.
Bien sûr que si.
Mais c'est pas grave.
Si ça l'était, ton père serait
probablement mort à l'heure qu'il est,
et on ne se serait jamais
rencontrés dans ce bus.
On va tourner une page,
je vais oublier mes hésitations.
Je vais faire en sorte de ramener
la lumière dans nos foyers.
Juste quelques jours.
Tu t'inquiètes pour moi ?
Reviens entière.
Papa ?
On n'a plus de dentifrice.
Ah bon, alors voila...
ce que M. Daley a fait.
- C'est pas du dentifrice.
- Si, c'en est.
Tu te moques de moi ?
Tu sais...
quand tes dents ont poussées,
tu n'as jamais pleuré.
Tu vois, la plupart des bébés
pleurent, mais pas toi.
Et ta...
mère s'inquiétait, et...
les docteurs s'inquiétaient,
mais pas moi.
Parce que je savais que
tu n'étais pas malade,
que tu n'avais pas mal,
mais que tu étais courageux.
Parce que tu es le garçon le plus
courageux que je connaisse.
Tu l'as toujours été.
Papa ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Sam,
je dois aller travailler demain.
J'ai un rendez-vous important,
assez loin d'ici.
Je ne reviendrais pas
avant un jour ou deux,
je voulais juste que tu le saches.
Tu en as assez de moi ?
Quoi ?
Tu t'en vas.
Écoute-moi bien.
Il n'y a rien que
toi, ta soeur ou ta mère
puissiez faire qui m'oblige
à vous quitter.
Je...
Je t'aime.
Tu comprends, hein ?
<i>"Sois gentille.
Elle sera de la famille bientôt."</i>
Bienvenue à la maison.
Ça s'est bien passé ?
- Vous avez les pièces ?
- On les avait...
et on les a perdues.
Où est Heather ?
Elle rallume les lumières.
Tu es conscient que ce qui
est arrivé aujourd'hui
était inutile ?
Et stupide ?
Tu as des responsabilités
maintenant.
Tu devrais plus réfléchir
à ce que tu fais.
J'ai compris.
Et toi... tu savais que la voiture
ne passerait pas au
travers de cette grille ?
Je sais.
Je t'ai entendu,
et je savais que tu avais raison.
Pourquoi tu ne t'es pas arrêté ?
Je sais pas.
Qu'est-ce que t'as récupéré ?
Regarde-moi tout ça.
Tu t'es bien débrouillé.
C'est rien.
Skylar, ta famille possède une
grande partie de la mine ?
Je ne sais pas.
Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'elle pourrait
nous rendre riches.
Ça va ?
Écoute...
Je suis content que tu
t'en sois sortie.
On part demain matin,
à la première heure.
<i>"As-tu localisé le paquet ?"</i>
<i>"As-tu localisé le paquet ?"
" Pas encore."</i>
<i>"Comment fait-on ?"</i>

<i>Previously on Jericho.</i>
So I hear you and I
are going to be partners now.
Where'd you get that?
You're running the store,
you're going to need protection.
Don't make the same mistake
that Gracie made.
Or those people out there
are going to be putting
flowers and candles
on the sidewalk for you.
Who the hell is that?
Remember,
the gas tank on this thing
is on the left-hand side,
so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you,
make sure it's not on that side.
Okay. Anything else?
So, are we going to see you
for Thanksgiving?
Well, I think Mary and I
are going to spend it together.
Well, you're always welcome.
Thanks, but I don't want to put
you guys in an awkward position.
You could have thought of that before
you moved in with your mistress
and left your wife with us.
Some of them were on planes
that landed in the middle of nowhere.
They've been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
Oh, my God.
Is it really you?
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while
until I can sort something out.
Are we in danger, Robert?
You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.
You need to keep them
clean and warm.
Do you have a place to stay?
Do you know anyone in Jericho?
Actually,
I do.
It's freezing in here, too.
Mr. Bintner?
Mr. Bintner?
Joe?
The temperature dropped so fast.
It's going to be a long winter.
All right, everyone!
Everyone, please!
Please!
Right now,
we're using the generator
to power the town hall
for three hours a day,
and the Med Center for six.
And this is how much fuel we have,
and this is how much we need
to get us through the winter.
At current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel
in two weeks.
I wonder when the dancing girls show up.
Stop.
There's a way of doing this without
scaring the crap out of everybody.
He was elected.
Guess he's going to do it his way.
I'm going to need a hobby.
So here's what we're working on.
All right, we got
organized firewood crews...
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Yeah.
There's a woman
in that group of refugees
that Bill is processing,
I think you should talk to her.
Why?
She said she used to be
a cop in Saint Louis.
Especially with 53
new people among us,
we have got to start rethinking things,
fast,
or the people we lost last night
won't be the only casualties
of this coming winter.
What about the windmills?
She's right.
Wind power.
We should be building windmills.
Harry?
I think you all know Harry Carmichael,
our chief engineer
down at the mine.
We've been looking into wind turbines
for weeks now with Mayor Green.
But in order to build anything
that can be connected to the grid,
it's going to take time.
Time I'm not sure we can afford.
- She's in here.
- Thanks, Jimmy.
Hello, Rob.
Any parts we don't have...
we simply don't have
the maching capabilities.
What kind of parts?
Mechanical governors to regulate output.
With the EMP damage, we're figuring
out a lot of this from scratch.
- It's still a long way off.
- Black Jack Fairgrounds.
We walked through it
on our way back here.
It's become a trading post.
People from all over
the region are trading...
food, information,
machine parts.
They may have what we need.
That's got to be a 200-mile drive.
That's a lot of gas for a "maybe."
If we can get one windmill working,
we'd save that much gas in a month.
If we get enough of them,
we could be off gas for good.
It might not be a bad idea
to put a small party together
and go check it out.
Is anyone interested
in volunteering?

I know it was you.
- What?
- Those men that grabbed me.
They said that someone
on my team sold us all out.
They said it was you.
And you believe them?
Tell me why I shouldn't.
Come on!
You're smart enough to know
that they will say anything
to get you to talk.
Because you know
I owe you my life
as much as you owe me yours
and because you just...
You just punched me in the face,
and I didn't hit you back.
- Who else is here?
- No one.
Victor showed up
just after D-day.
But he only made it
for a couple of hours.
Did you kill him?
It was the radiation...
from Denver.
No one else made it back here
to the rally point?
You going to tell me
how you got out of that room?
Three armed guys, cuffs.
Three guys and cuffs
keep you in that room?
One of them got too close.
Then there was only two.
Two was easy.
From there,
I drove as fast as I could.
Saw the clouds
from D. C. and Baltimore.
Ran out of gas in West Virginia.
Went from refugee camp
to refugee camp
however I could.
I'm glad you made it.
You left me.
I know.
So what now?
We caught wind of some raiding parties
at interchanges here and here.
But if you're careful,
you should be safe
the rest of the way.
Once you're at Black Jack,
watch your back.
Thieves?
It's not the thieves you got
to worry about, it's the guards.
They've got a reputation
of being really ruthless.
Without the cops
or the National Guard,
it's the only way they
guaranteed it's safe enough
to keep commerce going there.
You'd better take two or three
of the border patrol guys with you.
Just in case you run
into any surprises.
I'm coming, too.
Not a chance in hell.
Would you know
a working mechanical governor
for a wind turbine
if you saw one?
I'm not taking
passengers out there.
Jake, Mr. Carmichael has a family.
I can help.
You need me.
Mrs. Green?
What?
Eric told me that
April's pregnant.
I just...
- If there's anything that I can do...
- Mary...
I think you've done quite enough.
Always got to be the first one
to jump in the fire, don't you?
Somebody's got to go.
Yeah, well, just seems
that someone is always you.
Gray's having a few bags of salt
packed up for us to trade.
Smart.
Who else is going?
Apparently Heather.
Gray thinks I should take
a couple of guys from border patrol.
That's it?
I'm not so sure
pulling them off patrol
just to watch my back
is such a good idea.
Besides, only a handful of them
even know what they're doing.
You don't think
I can watch your back?
Why? You want to go?
Look, you've already seen
what it's like out there. I just...
need to see it for myself.
Besides, I'm unemployed.
I'm not obsolete.
Did you ask Mom?
Son, I am 59 years old.
I was mayor of this town
since the Carter administration.
I'm a retired U. S. Army Ranger
and a combat veteran.
Of course I asked your mother.
I could go downstairs and...
warm some water
for a bath for you.
I didn't think I was ever
going to finish this.
Hey, uh...
we have a guest.
This is Sarah.
Hey, Dale?
Hey. What are you
doing back there?
Uh, inventory.
Is it that bad?
Well, Mr. Houghton just showed up
with Mrs. Leigh's cut of the produce.
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, exactly.
Well, did you point out
that it's rotten?
They're all screwing me.
Hardly anyone's honoring their deals.
My dad used to have to deal with stuff
like this all the time
down at the salt mine.
- Well, how did he do it?
- He just...
did whatever it took
to keep things running.
I'm not shutting this place down.
Actually,
I may have
good news about that.
But you might have
to take a little trip.
I need to talk to you.
All right.
I shouldn't have sprung this on you.
This is too weird...
What? What's weird?
I kissed you.
A month ago.
And we haven't spoken since.
Generally, people speak
after something like that.
I'm just going to...
You know...
I know, I'm, uh...
- I'm sorry, really...
- You don't have to apologize.
I'm not upset.
I understand
why it happened.
Look, I want to go
because I think I can help get
this place back up on its feet.
That's it.
It's not a date.
Mr. Mayor?
I'm not the mayor anymore, Dale.
What is it?
I need to come with you.
I want to take it all.
Trade it for something
I can actually use
to build this store up again.
Whatever I don't use,
I'll put towards
supplies the town needs.
You're just going to give it
away to the town for nothing?
It's the right thing to do, isn't it?
I just want to help.
Well,
this is one hell of a crew
we're putting together here.
All right.
Yeah, we'll leave
first thing in the morning.
You just happen to know
someone who just...
happened to wander into town?
Look at me.
I'm not going to lie to you.
But I can't...
I can't tell you any more
than I already have.
So she's a friend, okay?
The last time you let someone
from that part of your life
- into our home, it was 4 years ago.
- This is different.
Well, you couldn't tell me
who he was.
But you told me not to worry.
Two weeks later, you left.
I didn't see you again
until two months ago.
This is different.
Sam cried for weeks.
I mean, he was four-years-old.
He didn't understand why
you'd want to leave him.
I just...
I don't know if I can watch him
go through that again.
What is going on here?
Come here.
What is this?
So I'm being watched.
By who?
My guess...
The Old Man.
Why...?
You still have the package, don't you?
He's been coordinating
this thing from the beginning,
feeding us information.
Why would he turn on us now?
I don't know.
You still have
a way to reach him?
And have you...
told him that you
made contact with me yet?
- Not yet.
- Then do it.
You do it...
and you see what he says.
"Thieves will be strung up."
We need your guns.
Pick them up on the way out.
Go ahead.
They're kidding about
the "strung up" thing, right?
They don't mean that literally.
Looks like everyone
checks in here at the main tent.
They try and match
buyers and sellers.
They gave me three
possibilities of sellers
that might have the part
for the windmill.
It's like eBay.
Not like eBay.
All right, look, um...
see if you can find the governor,
I'm going to stick with Dale.
See what he can trade for.
Let's do this thing quick
then we're out of here.
Morning.
Good morning.
Last night,
you fell asleep mid-sentence.
- I did?
- Yes, you did.
Standing up right there
at the sink, shaving.
You were going to tell me
what you've seen out there and...
Roger, I...
I don't want to push.
I can't even imagine how awful
it was for you out there. I just...
A lot of it was.
Listen.
If I tell you something,
will you promise not to think...
I've lost it?
Of course.
Out there...
I saw... something.
I haven't told
anybody about it. I...
can't explain it.
The thing is...
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
From there I ended up
in a tent city outside of Lexington.
So, what are they like?
The camps?
Each is, uh... different.
Some are overcrowded, dangerous.
Some are better run.
Did you see people
with radiation poisoning?
Some, yes.
What do they look like?
Lots of burns,
tissue loss, some vomiting.
Allie, Sam.
Upstairs.
How do you know my dad?
We worked together.
Do you know how
to play football?
Of course, I do.
Doesn't everybody?
Not everybody.
Hey, Samuel, now.
Come on.
You know, these kids
have been through enough.
I... I'm sorry.
Look, I don't know you.
I really don't want to.
I know the kind of people
my husband works with.
No matter how close
the two of you are,
I don't need my kids
exposed to that world.
I've been married to
this man a long time.
I got pretty good at reading
between the lines.
Thanks, Mary.
Why don't you and I sit down
together and have a drink?
Hey, how much?
- Beg pardon?
- How much?
How much for what?
I don't know.
An hour?
An hour of what?
Wait, what?! No!
- How about a half hour?
- Is everything all right?
- I'm not a hooker, pal!
- Then what are you doing here?
All right, that's enough.
That's enough, man.
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey, no. No.
No problem. Everything's fine.
No kidding, buddy.
You don't want to mess with
the guards here, it gets ugly, fast.
Thanks for the help.
Heather.
Oh, my God, Ted.
I can't believe you're here.
Jake, this is Ted Lewis.
We grew up together
over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
I was so worried about you.
We were going to send a party
to make contact with you guys,
but the roads were
just so dangerous.
What are you guys doing here?
We're looking for parts
for a windmill generator.
Unsuccessfully.
Hey, there's a guy
we deal with here...
who doesn't always
report to the main tent,
but sometimes he's got
those specialty items
nobody else has.
You want to see him?
- Yeah, let's check it out.
- All right.
Get this stuff out of here
before somebody sees it.
Why, what's wrong with it?
Nickel...
the silver stuff
is all alloyed with it.
So?
So nickel absorbs radioactivity.
Stuff that's been looted
from hot zones
is making a lot of people sick.
No one wants it.
This stuff was nowhere
near the fallout.
Look, kid,
if I can't sell it, I can't sell it.
What do you want me to tell you?
What else do you got?
So what does have value here?
Not much of what you got.
Check the board over there.
Why salt?
It's a preservative.
An antibiotic.
You need 1,500 milligrams
of it a day to survive.
The Romans actually
used it as currency.
Whole African empires
were based on the control
and supply of it.
Wars have been fought over salt.
Food, medical supplies,
a generator, all air-dropped,
all from China.
What?
Yeah, we got an airdrop, too.
The thing is...
it was from Germany.
It's aid. It must be coming
from all over the world.
Well, if aid's coming
from all over the world then...
who did this to us?
A group of thugs a few weeks back,
guys claiming to be
government contractors.
So the mayor thought
we should make security a priority.
He resigned his office and...
appointed Sheriff Constantino
acting city manager.
The contractors,
who were they?
A security detail from a...
company called Ravenwood.
They came in looking for supplies.
A few of the shop owners resisted
and they got violent.
They killed three,
they injured eight.
They drove off with
a truckload of our diesel.
But since then,
the sheriff's managed to
keep control of things.
Crime really isn't a
problem for us anymore.
How'd he manage that?
- What is this?
- The news.
Where does all this come from?
People pass through here
from all over.
Everyone brings
a little piece of the puzzle.
Do you have
something to write on?
You guys don't
get out much, do you?
It gets better.
What are the stars for?
Capitals.
Of what?
The federal government.
Federal government? But...
There are six stars up there.
Where's the president?
Which one?
Six presidents, I...
I don't understand.
Who's in charge of the military?
You're assuming
there's only one of those, too.
All right, come on, let's go.
Isn't there a line of succession,
so there's only one successor?
The word is HHS.
Secretary Charles is supposed
to be next in line,
but there are five other guys
who seem to think
the attacks changed the rules.
Senator Morrisette in Oregon,
Senator Tomarchio in Wyoming...
They're all staking a claim,
gathering support.
Then what happens?
How do they figure out who's in charge?
Either they start making deals,
- compromise...
- Or?
Or they fight.
Six bags of soybean seed,
and still it's...
It's not enough.
Maybe this whole thing
was a bad idea.
It's a start.
Dale, wait up.
It'd be a lot easier for you
to close the store, wouldn't it?
But instead, you're out here
trying to keep it going.
I think Gracie
would be proud of you.
I think your mom would
be proud of you, too.
When my mom died,
there was nothing I could do about it.
But then after Mrs. Leigh...
Mitchell Cafferty
is going to get his due
whether Gray finds him or not.
Sooner or later, he's going
to cross the wrong person.
One of these days,
it's going to catch up with him.
I don't like to drink
while I'm working.
To be honest, I have
difficulty understanding
how many ways I dislike you.
You made a list?
Mrs. Green, I don't think I...
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there
and listen to what
I have to say.
What you and Eric
did to April was awful.
But she's going
to get through this
because she is
one strong woman.
But there's a baby on the way,
and it happens
to be my grandchild.
And I intend to do
everything I can
to protect it from this world.
But what you've done,
I can't protect it from.
You've divided the family.
And as hard as that child's
life was going to be,
you have made it
so much more difficult.
I don't think that's something
I'll ever be able to forgive.
When I was a kid,
my mom split on my dad and I.
She left with the guy
she met in Denver...
This isn't about you.
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there
and listen to what I have to say.
I lay awake at night
terrified that I have
put April in the same
position my dad was in...
Terrified that I have put this child
in the same position that I was in.
My mistake was falling
in love with your son,
I never should have let
it happen, but I did.
I know the cost.
I know how wrong it is.
But the problem is,
he loves me, too.
And I don't know
how you undo that.
So if you want
to go on hating me,
if you never accept me...
I can't say as I blame you.
So I went to find help.
I was more messed up
than I thought.
I wandered for days.
Eventually...
passed out in this... field.
So there I was,
the middle of Nebraska
feeling like that was the place
I was going to die.
And then,
the strangest thing happened.
There was a...
light in the sky.
A bright light with a...
ring around it.
I...
went... towards it.
Two miles later...
I stumbled into
the refugee camp.
That light...
saved my life.
Been looking all over for you.
Did you find the part?
I think so.
Did you see the news?
You looking to trade
for a mechanical governor?
Okay, let's talk trade.
Eight bags of salt
at 35 pound per.
Russell, what did they think?
That they're the first ones
to think of this?
These parts are in high demand.
I'm not giving it away.
- What more is it going to take?
- What more?
I turned away a guy
just this morning,
and he offered 80 gallons
of diesel for the thing.
Listen...
We have more salt
than you can imagine.
We have the largest
salt mine for 400 miles
and we've got men to mine it.
But if you ever want
to see any of it,
we need to make
this deal right now, today.
You understand?
Okay, listen,
I'll vouch for him.
All right?
All right.
We got a deal.
Wait here. I'll go get it.
These things aren't
easy to make, you know.
Not the good ones anyway.
Dad, this is Russell.
Hi. Good to meet you.
Mr. Mayor?
No kidding, Dale,
I am not the mayor anymore.
There's blood on them.
- You need some help there?
- What the hell is this?
Are you conducting an inspection
or are we doing a deal?
No, we're not supporting that.
We'll find another solution.
Well, then we're all done here,
aren't we?
Why don't you get out?
Get out of here.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
You, too!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Guys, I'm so sorry.
We had no idea.
We need that part.
- And we're going to have to figure out
a way... - Where's Dale?
Dale, where'd you get off to?
Don't just wander off like that.
Did you steal that?
He's a bad guy.
He can't get away with that.
We got to get that back before
they realize it's missing.
It's okay I went out
the back. No one saw me.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hand him over.
He made a mistake, all right?
He'll give back what he took.
It's no harm done, all right?
Excuse me. You know,
he really is sorry and
the property is back
where it belongs.
He can explain it to management.
I'm just asking you,
use a little discretion,
that's all, please.
Excuse me, but could I talk
to whoever's in charge here?
Look, old man, I told you...
That's enough!
How long have you been
with the FBI?
14 years.
Started right out of college.
It's dangerous out there, isn't it?
I don't think your mom wants me
talking to you about that.
I'm not a kid.
It's pretty bad.
My dad's been teaching me
how to shoot.
I wonder if that's why.
He's been teaching you
how to shoot?
A little.
I'm not sure if I like it.
It's a weird feeling, but...
it's the first time I can remember
the two of us actually doing
something together.
Where's your father?
It's the old man.
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.
He knows where you are.
We need to go.
We need to move now.
No, I don't know.
You don't know?
This country is going
to be what we make of it.
There are only a
handful of other people
that know what we know.
We have to keep fighting.
We have to stay alive.
We go see him, and if,
if he is behind this,
we take him out.
Take him out?
Yeah, I mean,
how long can we run?
How long can my family run?
We pay him a visit,
we eliminate the threat.
We go straight at him, there is
a chance we don't come back.
You're leaving.
She walked in that door,
I knew right away you'd be leaving.
You have nothing to worry about.
It's not me that
I'm worried about.
Our children need a father.
Whatever you're going to do,
it can't be more important than that.
Do you trust her?
I have to.
If she's a threat to this
family's safety,
if she's a threat to you...
you kill her.
You understand?
Get in!
Hurry!
Stop the car.
Jake, this car will not fit
through that barricade.
Stop the car now!
Thanks. I, uh,
I don't know how this would have
turned out if it weren't for you guys.
- Well, you'll make it up to us someday.
- However we can help.
Those windmills you're looking
to build... I was thinking.
Guys down at the
old brake assembly,
maybe they can convert
part of their plant,
help build what you need.
I know the town could use
a good source of salt.
Looks like we're going
to be seeing a lot of each other.
- Thanks again, guys. Take care.
- Thank you so much.
What?
Jake, I saw the governor.
I saw how it's put together.
I was talking to Ted,
and I think between the two of us,
we can help to make more of them,
but I have to go with him.
- Go with them? Wait a minute.
- No, think about it.
We don't have the resources
to do this the right way.
They've got the machines
and the guys who
know how to use them.
With a dozen full-sized windmills,
you could power the whole town,
run the med center,
forget about gas.
You're just going to leave?
Right now?
It won't be for very long.
Just a few days.
But I know I can help.
I think I need to do this.
You think this is a good idea?
You know why things
didn't work out between us?
I'm not dangerous.
I'm crossword puzzles
and flannel pajamas and
the occasional lite beer.
I was never going to be
hazardous to you.
- That's how you tick.
- No, it isn't.
Of course it is.
But it's okay.
If it wasn't, your dad would
probably be dead right now,
you and I would have
never met on that bus.
So I'm taking a page out of your book.
I'm throwing caution to the wind.
I'm gonna help turn the lights
on for everyone back home.
Just for a few days.
You worried about me?
Come back in one piece.
Dad?
We're out of the good toothpaste.
Oh, well, here's the...
The new stuff that Mr. Daley made.
- This isn't toothpaste.
- Yeah, it is.
Are you playing a joke on me?
Hey, you know, uh,
when you were teething,
you never cried.
See, 'cause most babies,
they cry, but not you.
And your...
mom was worried and the...
doctors were worried,
but not me.
Because I knew you weren't sick,
you weren't hurt,
you were just brave.
'Cause you're
the bravest person I know.
You always have been.
Dad?
What are you talking about?
Sam,
I have to go to work tomorrow.
It's a very important meeting,
but it's quite far away,
so I might not be back
for a day or two,
and I just wanted you to know that.
Are you mad at me?
What?
You're leaving.
You listen to me.
There is nothing that
you, your sister or your mother
could ever do that would
make me want to leave you.
I, uh...
I, I love you.
You understand that, right?
Hey, welcome home.
Success?
- You get the part?
- We had it...
and we lost it.
Uh, where's Heather?
Getting the lights back on.
You do realize that
what happened today
was unnecessary?
And stupid?
You got a lot
of responsibility now.
You're going to have to learn
how to be smart.
I understand.
And you,
you knew that this car
was not going to fit
through that gate?
I know.
I heard you talking to me,
and I knew you were right.
Why didn't you stop the car?
I don't know.
What'd you get?
Look at all this stuff.
Oh, you did great.
This is nothing.
Skylar, how much of the salt mine
does your family own?
I don't know. Why?
'Cause I think we may be rich.
You okay?
Look, uh...
I am glad you made it.
We leave first thing
in the morning.

Précédemment dans Jericho...
<i>Ramène-les à l'intérieur.</i>
<i>Certains étaient en avion</i>
<i>et se sont posés au
milieu de nulle part.</i>
<i>Ils ont marché des
semaines.</i>
<i>Ils ont dû vivre l'enfer.</i>
<i>Oh, mon Dieu... Roger.</i>
<i>Vous avez des engelures
sur vos orteils et vos doigts.</i>
<i>Vous devez les garder
propres et au sec.</i>
<i>Connaissez-vous quelqu'un
à Jericho ?</i>
<i>En fait... Oui.</i>
<i>Salut, Rob.</i>
<i>Nous utilisons le générateur
pour alimenter la mairie</i>
<i>pendant trois heures par jour,
et six heures pour l'hôpital.</i>
<i>Avec 53 nouvelles personnes,
à cette allure,</i>
<i>nous n'aurons plus d'essence
dans deux semaines.</i>
<i>- Mme Green ?
- Quoi ?</i>
<i>Eric m'a dit qu'April
est enceinte.</i>
<i>C'est le Vieil Homme.</i>
<i>Il veut nous monter
l'un contre l'autre.</i>
<i>On va le voir,
et s'il est derrière tout ça,</i>
<i>on se débarrasse de lui.</i>
<i>On part demain matin,
à la première heure.</i>
<i>"As-tu localisé le paquet ?"
" Pas encore."</i>
<i>"Comment fait-on ?"</i>
<i>"On se sert de sa famille."</i>
Ça s'est bien passé ?
Désolé, m'dame.
Rien ?
Même pas des lapins ?
Non, j'ai jamais vu ça avant.
Rien ne bouge dehors.
Les retombées ?
Peut-être que ce sont les radiations
qui ont tué le cerf.
Même pas d'animaux morts,
de carcasses... c'est bizarre.
Comme si tout avait disparu.
Jusqu'où êtes-vous allés ?
24 kilomètres par Mill Pond
le long de la crique.
Il va falloir prendre un véhicule,
hein Jake ?
Ouais, mais il faut faire attention à
ne pas brûler les réserves
d'essence en plein hiver.
Il faut en garder le maximum
pour le générateur.
On peut vivre sans pour le moment.
Faire... des feux pour
rester au chaud.
Mais on ne passera pas l'hiver
si on ne mange pas.
Stanley et moi devrons utiliser toute
l'essence que nous avons en réserve.
Partir vers l'ouest, aussi
loin qu'il le faut.
Les autres chasseurs devront
rester dans les parages.
Oui, et Mimi vient avec nous.
Quoi ?
Au cas où quelque chose m'arriverait,
je veux qu'elle sache...
poser des pièges et tirer, OK ?
Bon, plus vous irez loin, plus
les routes seront dangereuses.
La nourriture se faisant rare...
il y aura des risques là-bas.
Ce sac de couchage tient à -40°C et...
voilà un briquet-tempête.
Tu vas avoir besoin
des deux.
Bonne chasse.
Je pense que les habitants de Jericho
ne savent pas ce qu'il y a ici.
Ils ignorent beaucoup de choses.
Ça sera suffisant pour aller
chez Le Vieil Homme ?
Ce n'est qu'à 2 heures d'ici.
Je ne pensais pas que
c'était si proche.
Il a choisi le point de ralliement.
Il voulait que ce soit chez lui.
Ça fait longtemps qu'il
te surveille ?
À mon avis...
depuis que j'ai arrêté toute
communication, il y a quelques jours.
Tu as peur de ce qu'on
va trouver là-bas ?
- Pas toi ?
- On s'en sortira.
Toi et moi.
Allez, au boulot.
Ma grand-mère allait plus vite...
et elle n'avait même pas de voiture.
Doucement, on n'a
qu'un demi-réservoir.
On devrait arriver à Flint Springs.
Devrait ?
Tu veux dire quoi ?
Il y a une rivière.
C'est un bon terrain de chasse.
Mais c'est fou ça...
Je t'ai dit que je ne
voulais pas chasser.
Et tu veux que je tue Bambi ?
Écoute, tu vas apprendre, OK ?
Tout le monde doit participer.
Bonnie l'a déjà fait.
C'est parfait pour Bonnie.
Bonnie a grandi dans une ferme.
Mon seul contact avec la campagne,
c'était l'expo Ralph Lauren
au Neiman Marcus.
C'est comme chasser les soldes,
mais avec un flingue.
Des soldes ?
Chez Neimans ?
Parfois, j'oublie que pour vous,
le plus grand couturier est Wrangler.
Ça vous fait rire ?
Je découvre ton talent pour
les querelles conjugales.
Ferme-la.
Ce n'est pas une querelle.
Oh, mon Dieu
Ces chiens ont des plaques.
Regardez ça.
Pharmacie de Wall.
Wall, Dakota du Sud.
Vous pensez que c'est de
là qu'ils viennent ?
Réfléchissez.
Le Dakota du Sud, sans chauffage,
électricité, ni...
livraison de nourriture.
Ça doit être encore pire dans
le nord du Dakota.
Ou dans le Montana.
Oh, mon Dieu.
On nous en avait parlé...
à BlackJack.
Un exode de masse, des centaines,
peut-être des milliers de gens...
se dirigeant vers le sud.
Essayant de fuir l'hiver.
On devrait peut-être faire pareil ?

Quelle distance ?
... 60.
À peu près 60 mètres.
Alors 60 mètres, environ 1 personne
et demie par mètre,
Ça fait 90.
Presque 100 personnes
sur une longueur.
Vu comme le sol est piétiné,
on peut imaginer que 5 à 10 fois
plus de gens sont passés ici.
Presque un millier de personnes ?
Où vont-ils ?
Au sud du Texas, au Mexique.
Un endroit plus chaud.
Ça prendrait des semaines
pour y aller à pied.
Dieu combien de gens
ont eu la même idée.
La frontière pourrait être fermée.
On sait même pas si le
Mexique existe encore.
On pourrait essayer de
les rattraper.
On arrive à peine à se nourrir,
alors des centaines de plus...
On doit continuer.
Allons-y.
Excuse-moi.
Je reviens tout de suite.
Content que tu sois venue.
Merci.
- À quelle heure tu t'es...
- Très tôt...
ou tard, je pense.
Je ne voulais pas te réveiller,
tu étais si paisible.
Paisible ? Vraiment ?
Encore ces cauchemars ?
Posez-le là.
On a pas mieux dormi
l'un que l'autre.
Je ne pouvais m'empêcher
de penser à tous ces gens.
Et j'ai pensé à tous ces vêtements
qu'on avait au grenier.
Je me disais bien que je
connaissais ce pull.
Ouais, cette femme était
à Kansas City
quand il y a eu les explosions.
Son mari et ses deux enfants
l'attendaient chez eux.
Où ?
Denver.
J'ai amené tous ces gens ici.
En mieux ou en pire,
c'est leur maison maintenant.
Je dois m'assurer qu'on
prend soin d'eux.
Oui, bien sûr.
Que puis-je faire pour t'aider ?
Parle-leur...
suis ton instinct.
En réalité...
je dois m'occuper de tout ici.
- Je t'attends dehors.
- Tiens.
On revient avant la nuit.
Et si ce n'est pas le cas ?
Dis-moi juste quand je dois
commencer à m'inquiéter.
C'est la dernière fois.
Après ça...
je serai là...
pour de bon, hein ?
Je saurai te le rappeler.
Salut, chéri.
Comment ça s'est passé ce matin ?
Tout a foiré.
Je suis désolé, chérie.
Jake est parti.
J'espère que lui et Stanley
auront plus de chance.
April est là ?
Non, à la clinique.
Elle m'a promis de se reposer.
J'espère qu'il fait plus chaud
à la clinique qu'ici.
Je crois qu'on a perdu 10°C
en une heure dans la maison.
J'ai l'impression qu'un
ouragan approche.
On ferait mieux de protéger les
vitres du mieux qu'on peut.
Je vais chercher des vieux draps
et des toiles de lin.
On pourra calfeutrer
les portes avec.
Regarde ce que j'ai trouvé...
caché dans le placard de Jake.
Dieu sait depuis quand c'est là.
Bien, au moins il buvait
de bonnes choses.
Je cachais le pire tord-boyau
connu au monde
derrière le buffet de ma mère.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
Le ventre vide ?
Je vais chercher des verres.
Pourquoi avoir détruit tout ça.
S'ils voulaient mettre tout ça hors
d'usage, ils auraient pu l'emporter.
Ça vaut une petite
fortune depuis l'EMP.
Ils étaient pressés peut-être,
ou alors, ils n'avaient rien à faire
de tout ce matériel.
- Depuis combien de temps ?
- Deux jours...
Plus ou moins.
Mais on a eu un contact
avec lui hier.
<i>On a eu un contact
avec quelqu'un.</i>
<i>Communication à distance.</i>
<i>Quelqu'un d'autre utilise
ses codes d'accès.</i>
<i>Qui aurait pu faire ça ?</i>
Je te parie que je fais
mouche en premier.
Je te suis, pour une
douzaine d'oeufs.
Deux heures de coupe de bois.
Une consultation pour une
déduction d'impôts.
Et pourquoi pas des massages
de pied pendant une semaine ?
Pour moi, pas pour lui.
On en reparlera.
Stanley, stop.
- Qu'est-ce qu'ils foutent ?
- Ils bloquent la route.
Ils se l'approprient plutôt.
Très bien, demi-tour.
Et... pour aller où ?
Je sais pas. Fais-le, d'accord ?
Demi-tour. On trouvera un autre chemin.
Ils sont derrière.
Bon sang.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'ils
nous suivent ?
Stanley, fonce !
- Ça devrait nous ramener à l'autoroute.
- Et après ?
On essayera de rentrer,
pour aller chercher la patrouille.
Peut-être qu'ils vont abandonner
ou tomber en panne.
Si on ne se retrouve
pas à sec avant.
Stanley...
Stanley, attention !
On ne dirait pas qu'il
se soit défendu.
Il est mort sans savoir
ce qui lui arrivait.
Il devait faire confiance à celui
qui lui a fait ça.
Le fait est... qui que ce soit,
ils savaient ce qu'ils faisaient ici,
mais pas pour ça.
Je veux dire, regarde ça.
C'est un vrai bordel.
Mais les disques durs...
ils ont l'air d'être toujours intacts.
Le Vieil Homme avait des
informations sur toute l'équipe...
leurs coordonnées,
des infos sur leur passé...
Les dernières localisations.
Essayons de trouver
où ils sont.
On ne peut pas les semer.
- C'est loin Jericho ?
- Trop loin.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Baisse-toi.
Baisse-toi.
Donne-moi le disque que tu as.
Ça fait du bien de se remettre
en selle, hein ?
J'aurai préféré qu'on n'ait
pas besoin de venir ici.
Quoi, deviendrais-tu attentionné ?
Trop de bonheur familial ?
Pas tant que ça.
C'est bon. Ça y est.
On y est.

Le toréador du karaoké,
c'est bien ça ?
Je vous demande pardon ?
Dans ce bar à Barcelone.
Vous avez frappé un toréador qui voulait
que vous arrêtiez de chanter...
"Stairway to Heaven" ?
Roger vous a dit ça ?
Il a aussi dit que vous aimiez les Oreo,
les glaces et les marguerites.
Ne lui en veuillez pas.
Il essayait de nous
garder motivés.
Il nous parlait...
et grâce à ça, nous
avons continué.
Comment ça va ?
Je suis un peu fatiguée.
Je vais rentrer
et me changer.
Je pense que je vais rester encore
un peu si ça ne te dérange pas.
Non, bien sûr.
C'est vrai ?
Oui, c'est bon.
Il semblerait que tu apportes
de l'espoir à tous ces gens.
Bon, euh...
Je te verrai quand tu rentreras.
- À Jake.
- À Jake.
Qui aurait pensé, il y a six mois que
tu porterais un toast pour lui ?
Dieu sait qu'Eric n'aurait
pas caché la bouteille.
Jake et toi avez toujours eu beaucoup
plus de choses en commun
que tu veux bien l'admettre.
Vous alliez à la chasse...
tous ces weekends.
Pourquoi ce garçon restait-il assis des
heures dans cet abri pour cerf ?
Nous ne nous disions pas
un mot. Nous...
restions juste ensemble
dans les bois.
J'ai toujours eu peur
que Jake oublie tout ça.
Tu sais, il a grandi en se remémorant
seulement les mauvais moments.
Il ne voulait pas se souvenir
que nous étions... si proches.
Que nous étions... de vrais amis.
Il s'en souvient...
au fond de lui.
C'est pour ça que tu représentes
tellement pour lui.
Ce vent est effrayant.
J'espère que Stanley et Jake
vont bien là dehors.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Jake, Stanley ne bouge plus.
- Quoi ?
- Stanley ne bouge plus.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Cache-toi.
- Cache-toi.
- Non.
- Allez.
- Non. Stanley...
Tu seras en sécurité.
Allez ! Va te cacher !
Viens.
Stanley a besoin d'aide.
Je ne peux pas bouger.
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.
La moitié de l'équipe.
- On nous traque.
- C'est encore pire.
C'est Woodworth et sa femme.
Ils étaient à Richmond.
C'est sa fille.
Tous nos proches sont
aussi en danger.
Il n'y a pas d'issue.
Ne t'inquiète pas pour ta famille, on
empêchera qu'ils leur fassent du mal.
Il ne reste plus que nous,
Chavez et Cheung.
On retourne dans le champ,
on se cache dans les herbes
jusqu'à ce qu'on repère le chef.
Regarde ça.
Qu'est ce que c'est ?
Si on était pourchassés,
lui... c'est le chasseur.
Stanley, est-ce que ça va ?
Tu peux te lever ?
Ta jambe ?
Je crois que je me suis
tordu la cheville.
Je vais bien.
Je suis juste sonné.
- Je vais essayer de...
- Stanley, non.
On ne peut pas s'en sortir seuls.
Tu risques d'aggraver la situation.
Vous pourriez creuser
pour me dégager.
Très bien.
Aide-moi, attrape les pelles.
Elles sont dans la benne du camion.
Elles n'y sont plus.
Bon, donne-moi le cric.
Il est à l'arrière.
Ils ont tout pris.
Alors, ce bain ?
Tiède, puis froid...
puis vraiment glacial.
- Regarde, tu te souviens ?
- Oh, oui.
Times Square,
la Saint-Sylvestre de 2005.
Ruiné.
La gueule de bois était mémorable.
Tu te souviens de ce que je t'ai dit
juste avant que tu partes de Jericho ?
Que j'étais égoïste
et que je n'écoutais pas ?
Quelque chose comme ça ?
Tu ne peux pas savoir à quel point je
m'en suis voulu quand tu es parti.
- Je n'arrêtais pas de penser que c'était
la dernière...  - Tu avais raison.
Tu sais...
aujoud'hui...
en te voyant avec tous ces gens...
C'était comme si tu avais
trouvé ta voie.
J'essaye juste de m'en sortir,
tu vois ?
Nous ne sommes plus
les mêmes maintenant.
Mais je vais te dire la seule chose
qui n'a pas changé.
La seule constante.
Je t'aime.
Et il faudra bien plus que
la fin du monde pour changer ça.
- Comment vont tes jambes ?
- Je ne sais pas, je sens plus rien.
Le sol est gelé.
Tu ne peux pas te réchauffer.
On ne peut pas faire de feu ?
Tu sens les vapeurs ?
Tu dois retourner en ville.
Très bien.
Je vais essayer d'y aller.
Non. Tu ne peux pas
avec ta cheville.
- J'irai.
- Non. Ils ne sont pas loin.
Ils sont partis de l'autre côté.
Il y a une patrouille,
à 8 km de Jericho.
Nous ne sommes pas
à plus de 16 km.
Jake, c'est trop dangereux.
Tu vois mieux ?
Sans sac de couchage,
sans arme ?
Bon, l'un de vous doit y aller ou nous
allons tous y rester.
D'accord, bien, bien.
J'ai jeté une torche par là.
Tu vas en avoir besoin.
Écoute...
reste sur tes gardes tout
le temps,  OK ?
Si tu vois des phares
ou que tu entends un moteur,
tu te caches en vitesse.
D'accord ?
Bon, tu devras aller vers...
le sud-est.
Stanley, ça ne veut
rien dire pour moi.
Reste sur cette route.
Reste sur cette route
puis tu prends...
la première à droite...
pendant environ deux kilomètres...
puis tu prends la deuxième
à droite...
et encore à droite
puis à gauche.
Et dès que tu arrives à la bretelle
d'autoroute, tu seras en sécurité.
Tu verras un grand panneau donnant
la direction de Jericho, OK ?
C'est bon ?
Gauche, deuxième à droite.
Droite, gauche.
Bien.
Mimi, je...
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Je ferai attention.
<i>Voilà ce que nous allons faire...</i>
Je connais un endroit sûr.
Nous emmenons Darcy et
les enfants loin de Jericho,
et on les cache avant
de continuer.
Je ne vais pas les laisser seuls.
- Je crois que tu n'as pas le choix.
- Non...
Écoute, j'ai un moyen
de pression.
S'ils me tuent, ils ne trouveront
jamais le paquet.
Ce n'est pas seulement toi
qu'ils vont tuer.
Ça peut être Sam,
ou Darcy ou moi...
n'importe qui pour t'atteindre.
N'importe quoi pour m'atteindre.
Le corps.
Les... Les...
ces disques à moitié détruits...
<i>toute cette...</i>
toute cette mise en scène.
Si quelqu'un avait voulu
tout détruire,
pourquoi laisser la maison
intacte, hein ?
Pourquoi ne pas tout brûler ?
Quelqu'un voulait
qu'on voit tout ça.
C'est un piège.
Pourquoi quelqu'un
voudrait faire ça ?
Je ne sais pas,
mais c'est trop énorme.
Il y a trop d'incohérences.
Trop d'inconnues.
Je dois rentrer chez moi.
- Robert, attends.
- Quoi ?
Réfléchissons à tout ça.
Quel est le plan ?
Que vas-tu faire ?
Tu sais, peut-être que le plan dès le
début était de nous faire partir.
Je dois protéger ma
famille, Sarah.
Et concernant le paquet ?
Il doit être déplacé.
C'est pas si mal, hein ?
On a déjà survécu à pire.
Souviens-toi, on était coincé
sur le toit
de la mairie en plein milieu d'une
tempête d'éclairs, hein ?
On avait tellement peur que
les éclairs...
fassent exploser les feux d'artifice.
Tu couinais comme une petite fille
en voulant sauter du toit.
C'était toi.
Ta voix n'a toujours pas changé.
S'il te plaît, j'ai entendu cette voix
pendant quoi, six mois.
Bois un coup.
Elle a gelé.
Quoi ?
J'ai vu une cabane abandonnée
à 500 m de la route.
Tu dois t'y réfugier.
Tu vas souffrir, mais
tu peux y arriver.
- Jake, je reste.
- Écoute-moi !
Il n'est pas question qu'on meure
de froid tous les deux ici.
- Elle va revenir.
- Quand ?
Elle est partie il y a une heure. Il faut
du temps pour rejoindre la patrouille,
mais après,
elle trouvera quelqu'un.
Je sais qu'elle trouvera quelqu'un.
Si personne d'autre
ne la trouve avant.
Écoute...
il va bientôt faire nuit,
tu dois y aller.
Tu ne voudrais pas plus me laisser
que je ne te laisserai.
Mimi est forte.
Elle trouvera son chemin.
Bon...
il a dit d'aller vers l'est.
Non... sud-est.
Et... chercher un panneau.
Oh, bon sang,
je déteste cet endroit !
Allez, mec.
Ne t'endors pas.
Relève-toi.
Arrête de trembler.
Parle-moi...
Bouge-toi, mon pote.
Tu dois me parler.
Parle-moi, mec.
Je suis désolé.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
À propos de quoi ?
Il y a cinq ans...
Désolé d'être parti
comme je l'ai fait.
C'est bon.
C'est pas grave.
C'est pas grave.
J'aurais dû appeler.
J'allais t'appeler.
Je sais. Écoute, je veux que
tu oublies tout ça, d'accord ?
On n'ira jamais se balader
au Costa Rica.
Tu sais quoi ?
On ira se balader au
Costa Rica, OK ?
On...
On va apprendre le surf.
On va dormir sur la plage.
Dès que les avions
voleront à nouveau,
ça sera que toi et moi.
Bon sang, tu peux même nous
y emmener, hein?
Allez. Allez.
Dis quelque chose, mec.
Je t'ai pas parlé pendant
cinq ans, tu étais parti.
Raconte... Parle-moi
de San Diego.
Comment c'était ?
- Chaud.
- Chaud, bien.
Plages, blondes, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que tu
faisais là-bas ?
Je pilotais, je pilotais
des avions.
Vraiment ?
C'est super, mec.
Ton grand père n'était
pas fou, hein ?
Tu avais une copine là-bas ?
Je sais que tu en avais une.
Elle est morte.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Tu n'en sais rien.
Tu ne sais pas où elle était
quand les bombes ont explosé.
Elle a pu s'en sortir, hein ?
- Dis-moi son nom.
- Elle est morte...
C'est ma faute.
- C'est pas de ta faute.
- Laisse-moi...
Laisse-moi m'allonger.
C'était pas de ta faute.
Reste avec moi.
Il faut que tu restes avec moi.
Allez, Jake.
Reste avec moi Jake.
Allez mec.
Reste avec moi.
Allez !
OK, faut que tu continues.
Faut que t'avances.
Me faites pas de mal...
Mimi ?
C'est Gail et Johnston Green, trésor.
Tu es sauvée.
Merci mon Dieu !
Viens chérie,
allons-nous-en.
Allez.
Ils sont affreux.
Ce sont les draps
de ton ancien appartement ?
Parce que personne
ne peut dormir avec ça.
Si quelqu'un nous demande,
on dira qu'on nous les a donnés.
Ta robe.
Je suis pas censé la voir, hein ?
Il semblerait que la date
soit déjà passée, alors...
On en trouvera une autre.
Tu le penses vraiment ?
Oui.
Il me reste un paquet
de nouilles chinoises
avec ton nom dessus,
qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
Génial. J'apporte ça à l'abri,
je reviens, je me passe un coup d'eau.
Roger, attends.
Je t'accompagne.
C'est Maman et Papa, chéri !
Stanley, ça va, trésor ?
Va dans le camion
te réchauffer, l'ami.
- Où est Mimi ?
- Je suis là.
Stanley, je suis là.
Réveille-toi, réveille-toi.
Réveille-toi, Jake.
Réveille-toi.
Réveille-toi. Merci mon Dieu.
On va te sortir de là, chéri.
On a vu la tempête arriver,
on a commencé à s'inquiéter
quand on t'a pas vu revenir.
Chérie...
Chérie,
on n'arrivera pas
à dégager ce camion.
Il faut que tu les ramènes en ville
et que tu nous ramènes de l'aide.
Lance un signal en revenant,
je saurai que c'est toi, OK ?
- Des appels de phares.
- Très bien, vas-y !
Jake, regarde-moi, fiston.
Je suis là.
Tu vas t'en sortir, fiston...
Je te connais.
Je sais par quoi t'es passé.
Tu vas t'en sortir.
Tu vas t'en sortir.
Reste avec moi.
Robert, s'il te plaît,
les enfants sont endormis.
- Désolé.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous, bon sang ?
Je suis désolé.
Jake, tu seras bientôt à la maison,
mais il faut que
tu restes éveillé. Allez.
Abandonne-moi.
Laisse-moi tout seul.
Non, j'irai nulle part.
Mais il faut que tu t'accroches.
Ils devraient plus tarder, maintenant.
Papa.
Je suis désolé.
Fiston, t'as pas à t'excuser.
Ouvre les yeux, Jake.
Tiens bon.
Regarde-moi.
Regarde-moi, Jake.
Je la revois.
Voir qui ?
La fille.
Quelle... fille ?
Jake, je pense
que tu hallucines, fiston.
Non, écoute-moi.
Quand j'étais en Irak...
il y avait une fille.
Elle devait pas avoir plus de...
10 ou 12 ans...
Arrête de parler, fiston.
Économise tes forces.
On parlera quand on... rentrera.
Je l'ai tuée, Papa.
J'ai tué une petite fille.
Dépêchez-vous !
Ouvre les yeux, Jake.
Ouvre les yeux.
OK, tout le monde, à 3...
Un,
deux, trois !
C'est bon, il est libre.
Approchez la planche.
Un, deux, trois.
T'avais raison.
Il faut que j'éloigne ma famille
de moi dès que possible.
J'ai réfléchi, et...
Il n'y a pas d'autre solution.
T'as fait le bon choix.
Écoute.
Dès qu'ils seront en sécurité,
toi et moi devons
reprendre du service.
La moitié de l'équipe
est morte, Sarah,
et quiconque a fait ça,
a une bonne raison de le faire.
Comment tu vas le dire à Darcy ?
Je lui dirai après
les avoir déménagés.
Elle refusera si elle sait
que je ne reste pas avec eux.
Il est mieux ici
qu'au centre médical.
On est toujours sur le courant
de secours, il fait plus chaud ici.
Tiens, chéri.
Et ses blessures ?
La blessure à la tête
n'est pas profonde,
et ses jambes ne sont pas cassées.
Il a eu beaucoup de chance.
Je suis gelé.
Je vais te chercher
d'autres couvertures.
Tu es en état d'hypothermie.
Il faudra quelques heures
pour que ta température se stabilise.
- Vous pouvez nous laisser une minute ?
- Bien sûr.
Papa...
Ce que je t'ai dit là-bas...
Je t'en prie, oublie-le.
Je t'en prie.
J'ai bien peur que ce soit impossible.
J'ai vu beaucoup de choses
dans ma vie, Jake.
J'ai vu la guerre.
Je sais ce qu'elle peut faire.
Je sais ce que les hommes
peuvent faire. De terribles...
terribles choses.
Je sais ce que j'ai fait.
Tu peux me parler.
Quand tu seras prêt, fiston.
Quand tu seras prêt.
Tu vas bien ?
Comment va ton entorse ?
Ça serait mieux avec des antidouleurs,
mais je vais pas me plaindre.
Tu sais, un moment, j'ai bien cru
que je ne sentirais plus jamais rien.
Quand j'étais là-bas,
pendant un moment,
je ne pensais pas m'en sortir.
Alors je me suis... endormie.
Et j'avais plus envie de bouger.
Mais tu l'as fait.
Tu l'as fait.
Et je savais que tu le ferais.
Tes lèvres sont toujours froides.
Peut-être que tu pourrais
les réchauffer.
On m'a jamais aussi mal draguée.
Je me doute, mais je peux faire pire.
- La ferme.
- OK.
Demain matin...
on part.
On part ? Pour aller où ?
Je ne sais pas encore.
Tu ne sais pas ?
Darcy, quand je suis venu
vous chercher à Washington...
je t'ai dit que vous n'étiez
pas en sécurité,
mais je ne pouvais pas
te dire pourquoi.
Je vais faire un tour.
J'ai quelque chose en ma possession.
Et il y a des gens là dehors
qui le convoitent,
que rien n'arrêtera pour l'obtenir.
Et ça nous met,
toi, moi et les enfants,
en danger.
OK, alors on... on part.
<i>Je te fais confiance.</i>
<i>Robert, est-ce que...</i>
Est-ce que tu me fais confiance ?
- Vous êtes en retard.
- Vous êtes impatient.
Alors, écoute-moi.
Sarah n'est pas de notre côté.
Qu'importe ce qu'il...
s'est passé entre vous deux,
je t'assure, Robert,
elle n'est pas là pour nous aider.
Vous avez localisé le paquet ?
Bientôt.
Hawkins commence à
assembler les pièces du puzzle.
- Il faut l'éliminer.
- Je sais.
Nous avons déjà éliminé
les trois autres cibles sans incident.
Pourquoi celle-ci prend plus de temps ?
Parce que celle-ci est différente.

Précédemment dans Jericho...
<i>Ramène-les à l'intérieur.</i>
<i>Certains étaient en avion</i>
<i>et se sont posés au
milieu de nulle part.</i>
<i>Ils ont marché des
semaines.</i>
<i>Ils ont dû vivre l'enfer.</i>
<i>Oh, mon Dieu... Roger.</i>
<i>Vous avez des engelures
sur vos orteils et vos doigts.</i>
<i>Vous devez les garder
propres et au sec.</i>
<i>Connaissez-vous quelqu'un
à Jericho ?</i>
<i>En fait... Oui.</i>
<i>Salut, Rob.</i>
<i>Nous utilisons le générateur
pour alimenter la mairie</i>
<i>pendant trois heures par jour,
et six heures pour l'hôpital.</i>
<i>Avec 53 nouvelles personnes,
à cette allure,</i>
<i>nous n'aurons plus d'essence
dans deux semaines.</i>
<i>- Mme Green ?
- Quoi ?</i>
<i>Eric m'a dit qu'April
est enceinte.</i>
<i>C'est le Vieil Homme.</i>
<i>Il veut nous monter
l'un contre l'autre.</i>
<i>On va le voir,
et s'il est derrière tout ça,</i>
<i>on se débarrasse de lui.</i>
<i>On part demain matin,
à la première heure.</i>
<i>"As-tu localisé le paquet ?"
" Pas encore."</i>
<i>"Comment fait-on ?"</i>
<i>"On se sert de sa famille."</i>
Ça s'est bien passé ?
Désolé, m'dame.
Rien ?
Même pas des lapins ?
Non, j'ai jamais vu ça avant.
Rien ne bouge dehors.
Les retombées ?
Peut-être que ce sont les radiations
qui ont tué le cerf.
Même pas d'animaux morts,
de carcasses... c'est bizarre.
Comme si tout avait disparu.
Jusqu'où êtes-vous allés ?
24 kilomètres par Mill Pond
le long de la crique.
Il va falloir prendre un véhicule,
hein Jake ?
Ouais, mais il faut faire attention à
ne pas brûler les réserves
d'essence en plein hiver.
Il faut en garder le maximum
pour le générateur.
On peut vivre sans pour le moment.
Faire... des feux pour
rester au chaud.
Mais on ne passera pas l'hiver
si on ne mange pas.
Stanley et moi devrons utiliser toute
l'essence que nous avons en réserve.
Partir vers l'ouest, aussi
loin qu'il le faut.
Les autres chasseurs devront
rester dans les parages.
Oui, et Mimi vient avec nous.
Quoi ?
Au cas où quelque chose m'arriverait,
je veux qu'elle sache...
poser des pièges et tirer, OK ?
Bon, plus vous irez loin, plus
les routes seront dangereuses.
La nourriture se faisant rare...
il y aura des risques là-bas.
Ce sac de couchage tient à -40°C et...
voilà un briquet-tempête.
Tu vas avoir besoin
des deux.
Bonne chasse.
Je pense que les habitants de Jericho
ne savent pas ce qu'il y a ici.
Ils ignorent beaucoup de choses.
Ça sera suffisant pour aller
chez Le Vieil Homme ?
Ce n'est qu'à 2 heures d'ici.
Je ne pensais pas que
c'était si proche.
Il a choisi le point de ralliement.
Il voulait que ce soit chez lui.
Ça fait longtemps qu'il
te surveille ?
À mon avis...
depuis que j'ai arrêté toute
communication, il y a quelques jours.
Tu as peur de ce qu'on
va trouver là-bas ?
- Pas toi ?
- On s'en sortira.
Toi et moi.
Allez, au boulot.
Ma grand-mère allait plus vite...
et elle n'avait même pas de voiture.
Doucement, on n'a
qu'un demi-réservoir.
On devrait arriver à Flint Springs.
Devrait ?
Tu veux dire quoi ?
Il y a une rivière.
C'est un bon terrain de chasse.
Mais c'est fou ça...
Je t'ai dit que je ne
voulais pas chasser.
Et tu veux que je tue Bambi ?
Écoute, tu vas apprendre, OK ?
Tout le monde doit participer.
Bonnie l'a déjà fait.
C'est parfait pour Bonnie.
Bonnie a grandi dans une ferme.
Mon seul contact avec la campagne,
c'était l'expo Ralph Lauren
au Neiman Marcus.
C'est comme chasser les soldes,
mais avec un flingue.
Des soldes ?
Chez Neimans ?
Parfois, j'oublie que pour vous,
le plus grand couturier est Wrangler.
Ça vous fait rire ?
Je découvre ton talent pour
les querelles conjugales.
Ferme-la.
Ce n'est pas une querelle.
Oh, mon Dieu
Ces chiens ont des plaques.
Regardez ça.
Pharmacie de Wall.
Wall, Dakota du Sud.
Vous pensez que c'est de
là qu'ils viennent ?
Réfléchissez.
Le Dakota du Sud, sans chauffage,
électricité, ni...
livraison de nourriture.
Ça doit être encore pire dans
le nord du Dakota.
Ou dans le Montana.
Oh, mon Dieu.
On nous en avait parlé...
à BlackJack.
Un exode de masse, des centaines,
peut-être des milliers de gens...
se dirigeant vers le sud.
Essayant de fuir l'hiver.
On devrait peut-être faire pareil ?

Quelle distance ?
... 60.
À peu près 60 mètres.
Alors 60 mètres, environ 1 personne
et demie par mètre,
Ça fait 90.
Presque 100 personnes
sur une longueur.
Vu comme le sol est piétiné,
on peut imaginer que 5 à 10 fois
plus de gens sont passés ici.
Presque un millier de personnes ?
Où vont-ils ?
Au sud du Texas, au Mexique.
Un endroit plus chaud.
Ça prendrait des semaines
pour y aller à pied.
Dieu combien de gens
ont eu la même idée.
La frontière pourrait être fermée.
On sait même pas si le
Mexique existe encore.
On pourrait essayer de
les rattraper.
On arrive à peine à se nourrir,
alors des centaines de plus...
On doit continuer.
Allons-y.
Excuse-moi.
Je reviens tout de suite.
Content que tu sois venue.
Merci.
- À quelle heure tu t'es...
- Très tôt...
ou tard, je pense.
Je ne voulais pas te réveiller,
tu étais si paisible.
Paisible ? Vraiment ?
Encore ces cauchemars ?
Posez-le là.
On a pas mieux dormi
l'un que l'autre.
Je ne pouvais m'empêcher
de penser à tous ces gens.
Et j'ai pensé à tous ces vêtements
qu'on avait au grenier.
Je me disais bien que je
connaissais ce pull.
Ouais, cette femme était
à Kansas City
quand il y a eu les explosions.
Son mari et ses deux enfants
l'attendaient chez eux.
Où ?
Denver.
J'ai amené tous ces gens ici.
En mieux ou en pire,
c'est leur maison maintenant.
Je dois m'assurer qu'on
prend soin d'eux.
Oui, bien sûr.
Que puis-je faire pour t'aider ?
Parle-leur...
suis ton instinct.
En réalité...
je dois m'occuper de tout ici.
- Je t'attends dehors.
- Tiens.
On revient avant la nuit.
Et si ce n'est pas le cas ?
Dis-moi juste quand je dois
commencer à m'inquiéter.
C'est la dernière fois.
Après ça...
je serai là...
pour de bon, hein ?
Je saurai te le rappeler.
Salut, chéri.
Comment ça s'est passé ce matin ?
Tout a foiré.
Je suis désolé, chérie.
Jake est parti.
J'espère que lui et Stanley
auront plus de chance.
April est là ?
Non, à la clinique.
Elle m'a promis de se reposer.
J'espère qu'il fait plus chaud
à la clinique qu'ici.
Je crois qu'on a perdu 10°C
en une heure dans la maison.
J'ai l'impression qu'un
ouragan approche.
On ferait mieux de protéger les
vitres du mieux qu'on peut.
Je vais chercher des vieux draps
et des toiles de lin.
On pourra calfeutrer
les portes avec.
Regarde ce que j'ai trouvé...
caché dans le placard de Jake.
Dieu sait depuis quand c'est là.
Bien, au moins il buvait
de bonnes choses.
Je cachais le pire tord-boyau
connu au monde
derrière le buffet de ma mère.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
Le ventre vide ?
Je vais chercher des verres.
Pourquoi avoir détruit tout ça.
S'ils voulaient mettre tout ça hors
d'usage, ils auraient pu l'emporter.
Ça vaut une petite
fortune depuis l'EMP.
Ils étaient pressés peut-être,
ou alors, ils n'avaient rien à faire
de tout ce matériel.
- Depuis combien de temps ?
- Deux jours...
Plus ou moins.
Mais on a eu un contact
avec lui hier.
<i>On a eu un contact
avec quelqu'un.</i>
<i>Communication à distance.</i>
<i>Quelqu'un d'autre utilise
ses codes d'accès.</i>
<i>Qui aurait pu faire ça ?</i>
Je te parie que je fais
mouche en premier.
Je te suis, pour une
douzaine d'oeufs.
Deux heures de coupe de bois.
Une consultation pour une
déduction d'impôts.
Et pourquoi pas des massages
de pied pendant une semaine ?
Pour moi, pas pour lui.
On en reparlera.
Stanley, stop.
- Qu'est-ce qu'ils foutent ?
- Ils bloquent la route.
Ils se l'approprient plutôt.
Très bien, demi-tour.
Et... pour aller où ?
Je sais pas. Fais-le, d'accord ?
Demi-tour. On trouvera un autre chemin.
Ils sont derrière.
Bon sang.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'ils
nous suivent ?
Stanley, fonce !
- Ça devrait nous ramener à l'autoroute.
- Et après ?
On essayera de rentrer,
pour aller chercher la patrouille.
Peut-être qu'ils vont abandonner
ou tomber en panne.
Si on ne se retrouve
pas à sec avant.
Stanley...
Stanley, attention !
On ne dirait pas qu'il
se soit défendu.
Il est mort sans savoir
ce qui lui arrivait.
Il devait faire confiance à celui
qui lui a fait ça.
Le fait est... qui que ce soit,
ils savaient ce qu'ils faisaient ici,
mais pas pour ça.
Je veux dire, regarde ça.
C'est un vrai bordel.
Mais les disques durs...
ils ont l'air d'être toujours intacts.
Le Vieil Homme avait des
informations sur toute l'équipe...
leurs coordonnées,
des infos sur leur passé...
Les dernières localisations.
Essayons de trouver
où ils sont.
On ne peut pas les semer.
- C'est loin Jericho ?
- Trop loin.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Baisse-toi.
Baisse-toi.
Donne-moi le disque que tu as.
Ça fait du bien de se remettre
en selle, hein ?
J'aurai préféré qu'on n'ait
pas besoin de venir ici.
Quoi, deviendrais-tu attentionné ?
Trop de bonheur familial ?
Pas tant que ça.
C'est bon. Ça y est.
On y est.

Le toréador du karaoké,
c'est bien ça ?
Je vous demande pardon ?
Dans ce bar à Barcelone.
Vous avez frappé un toréador qui voulait
que vous arrêtiez de chanter...
"Stairway to Heaven" ?
Roger vous a dit ça ?
Il a aussi dit que vous aimiez les Oreo,
les glaces et les marguerites.
Ne lui en veuillez pas.
Il essayait de nous
garder motivés.
Il nous parlait...
et grâce à ça, nous
avons continué.
Comment ça va ?
Je suis un peu fatiguée.
Je vais rentrer
et me changer.
Je pense que je vais rester encore
un peu si ça ne te dérange pas.
Non, bien sûr.
C'est vrai ?
Oui, c'est bon.
Il semblerait que tu apportes
de l'espoir à tous ces gens.
Bon, euh...
Je te verrai quand tu rentreras.
- À Jake.
- À Jake.
Qui aurait pensé, il y a six mois que
tu porterais un toast pour lui ?
Dieu sait qu'Eric n'aurait
pas caché la bouteille.
Jake et toi avez toujours eu beaucoup
plus de choses en commun
que tu veux bien l'admettre.
Vous alliez à la chasse...
tous ces weekends.
Pourquoi ce garçon restait-il assis des
heures dans cet abri pour cerf ?
Nous ne nous disions pas
un mot. Nous...
restions juste ensemble
dans les bois.
J'ai toujours eu peur
que Jake oublie tout ça.
Tu sais, il a grandi en se remémorant
seulement les mauvais moments.
Il ne voulait pas se souvenir
que nous étions... si proches.
Que nous étions... de vrais amis.
Il s'en souvient...
au fond de lui.
C'est pour ça que tu représentes
tellement pour lui.
Ce vent est effrayant.
J'espère que Stanley et Jake
vont bien là dehors.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Jake, Stanley ne bouge plus.
- Quoi ?
- Stanley ne bouge plus.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Cache-toi.
- Cache-toi.
- Non.
- Allez.
- Non. Stanley...
Tu seras en sécurité.
Allez ! Va te cacher !
Viens.
Stanley a besoin d'aide.
Je ne peux pas bouger.
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.
La moitié de l'équipe.
- On nous traque.
- C'est encore pire.
C'est Woodworth et sa femme.
Ils étaient à Richmond.
C'est sa fille.
Tous nos proches sont
aussi en danger.
Il n'y a pas d'issue.
Ne t'inquiète pas pour ta famille, on
empêchera qu'ils leur fassent du mal.
Il ne reste plus que nous,
Chavez et Cheung.
On retourne dans le champ,
on se cache dans les herbes
jusqu'à ce qu'on repère le chef.
Regarde ça.
Qu'est ce que c'est ?
Si on était pourchassés,
lui... c'est le chasseur.
Stanley, est-ce que ça va ?
Tu peux te lever ?
Ta jambe ?
Je crois que je me suis
tordu la cheville.
Je vais bien.
Je suis juste sonné.
- Je vais essayer de...
- Stanley, non.
On ne peut pas s'en sortir seuls.
Tu risques d'aggraver la situation.
Vous pourriez creuser
pour me dégager.
Très bien.
Aide-moi, attrape les pelles.
Elles sont dans la benne du camion.
Elles n'y sont plus.
Bon, donne-moi le cric.
Il est à l'arrière.
Ils ont tout pris.
Alors, ce bain ?
Tiède, puis froid...
puis vraiment glacial.
- Regarde, tu te souviens ?
- Oh, oui.
Times Square,
la Saint-Sylvestre de 2005.
Ruiné.
La gueule de bois était mémorable.
Tu te souviens de ce que je t'ai dit
juste avant que tu partes de Jericho ?
Que j'étais égoïste
et que je n'écoutais pas ?
Quelque chose comme ça ?
Tu ne peux pas savoir à quel point je
m'en suis voulu quand tu es parti.
- Je n'arrêtais pas de penser que c'était
la dernière...  - Tu avais raison.
Tu sais...
aujoud'hui...
en te voyant avec tous ces gens...
C'était comme si tu avais
trouvé ta voie.
J'essaye juste de m'en sortir,
tu vois ?
Nous ne sommes plus
les mêmes maintenant.
Mais je vais te dire la seule chose
qui n'a pas changé.
La seule constante.
Je t'aime.
Et il faudra bien plus que
la fin du monde pour changer ça.
- Comment vont tes jambes ?
- Je ne sais pas, je sens plus rien.
Le sol est gelé.
Tu ne peux pas te réchauffer.
On ne peut pas faire de feu ?
Tu sens les vapeurs ?
Tu dois retourner en ville.
Très bien.
Je vais essayer d'y aller.
Non. Tu ne peux pas
avec ta cheville.
- J'irai.
- Non. Ils ne sont pas loin.
Ils sont partis de l'autre côté.
Il y a une patrouille,
à 8 km de Jericho.
Nous ne sommes pas
à plus de 16 km.
Jake, c'est trop dangereux.
Tu vois mieux ?
Sans sac de couchage,
sans arme ?
Bon, l'un de vous doit y aller ou nous
allons tous y rester.
D'accord, bien, bien.
J'ai jeté une torche par là.
Tu vas en avoir besoin.
Écoute...
reste sur tes gardes tout
le temps,  OK ?
Si tu vois des phares
ou que tu entends un moteur,
tu te caches en vitesse.
D'accord ?
Bon, tu devras aller vers...
le sud-est.
Stanley, ça ne veut
rien dire pour moi.
Reste sur cette route.
Reste sur cette route
puis tu prends...
la première à droite...
pendant environ deux kilomètres...
puis tu prends la deuxième
à droite...
et encore à droite
puis à gauche.
Et dès que tu arrives à la bretelle
d'autoroute, tu seras en sécurité.
Tu verras un grand panneau donnant
la direction de Jericho, OK ?
C'est bon ?
Gauche, deuxième à droite.
Droite, gauche.
Bien.
Mimi, je...
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Je ferai attention.
<i>Voilà ce que nous allons faire...</i>
Je connais un endroit sûr.
Nous emmenons Darcy et
les enfants loin de Jericho,
et on les cache avant
de continuer.
Je ne vais pas les laisser seuls.
- Je crois que tu n'as pas le choix.
- Non...
Écoute, j'ai un moyen
de pression.
S'ils me tuent, ils ne trouveront
jamais le paquet.
Ce n'est pas seulement toi
qu'ils vont tuer.
Ça peut être Sam,
ou Darcy ou moi...
n'importe qui pour t'atteindre.
N'importe quoi pour m'atteindre.
Le corps.
Les... Les...
ces disques à moitié détruits...
<i>toute cette...</i>
toute cette mise en scène.
Si quelqu'un avait voulu
tout détruire,
pourquoi laisser la maison
intacte, hein ?
Pourquoi ne pas tout brûler ?
Quelqu'un voulait
qu'on voit tout ça.
C'est un piège.
Pourquoi quelqu'un
voudrait faire ça ?
Je ne sais pas,
mais c'est trop énorme.
Il y a trop d'incohérences.
Trop d'inconnues.
Je dois rentrer chez moi.
- Robert, attends.
- Quoi ?
Réfléchissons à tout ça.
Quel est le plan ?
Que vas-tu faire ?
Tu sais, peut-être que le plan dès le
début était de nous faire partir.
Je dois protéger ma
famille, Sarah.
Et concernant le paquet ?
Il doit être déplacé.
C'est pas si mal, hein ?
On a déjà survécu à pire.
Souviens-toi, on était coincé
sur le toit
de la mairie en plein milieu d'une
tempête d'éclairs, hein ?
On avait tellement peur que
les éclairs...
fassent exploser les feux d'artifice.
Tu couinais comme une petite fille
en voulant sauter du toit.
C'était toi.
Ta voix n'a toujours pas changé.
S'il te plaît, j'ai entendu cette voix
pendant quoi, six mois.
Bois un coup.
Elle a gelé.
Quoi ?
J'ai vu une cabane abandonnée
à 500 m de la route.
Tu dois t'y réfugier.
Tu vas souffrir, mais
tu peux y arriver.
- Jake, je reste.
- Écoute-moi !
Il n'est pas question qu'on meure
de froid tous les deux ici.
- Elle va revenir.
- Quand ?
Elle est partie il y a une heure. Il faut
du temps pour rejoindre la patrouille,
mais après,
elle trouvera quelqu'un.
Je sais qu'elle trouvera quelqu'un.
Si personne d'autre
ne la trouve avant.
Écoute...
il va bientôt faire nuit,
tu dois y aller.
Tu ne voudrais pas plus me laisser
que je ne te laisserai.
Mimi est forte.
Elle trouvera son chemin.
Bon...
il a dit d'aller vers l'est.
Non... sud-est.
Et... chercher un panneau.
Oh, bon sang,
je déteste cet endroit !
Allez, mec.
Ne t'endors pas.
Relève-toi.
Arrête de trembler.
Parle-moi...
Bouge-toi, mon pote.
Tu dois me parler.
Parle-moi, mec.
Je suis désolé.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
À propos de quoi ?
Il y a cinq ans...
Désolé d'être parti
comme je l'ai fait.
C'est bon.
C'est pas grave.
C'est pas grave.
J'aurais dû appeler.
J'allais t'appeler.
Je sais. Écoute, je veux que
tu oublies tout ça, d'accord ?
On n'ira jamais se balader
au Costa Rica.
Tu sais quoi ?
On ira se balader au
Costa Rica, OK ?
On...
On va apprendre le surf.
On va dormir sur la plage.
Dès que les avions
voleront à nouveau,
ça sera que toi et moi.
Bon sang, tu peux même nous
y emmener, hein?
Allez. Allez.
Dis quelque chose, mec.
Je t'ai pas parlé pendant
cinq ans, tu étais parti.
Raconte... Parle-moi
de San Diego.
Comment c'était ?
- Chaud.
- Chaud, bien.
Plages, blondes, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que tu
faisais là-bas ?
Je pilotais, je pilotais
des avions.
Vraiment ?
C'est super, mec.
Ton grand père n'était
pas fou, hein ?
Tu avais une copine là-bas ?
Je sais que tu en avais une.
Elle est morte.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Tu n'en sais rien.
Tu ne sais pas où elle était
quand les bombes ont explosé.
Elle a pu s'en sortir, hein ?
- Dis-moi son nom.
- Elle est morte...
C'est ma faute.
- C'est pas de ta faute.
- Laisse-moi...
Laisse-moi m'allonger.
C'était pas de ta faute.
Reste avec moi.
Il faut que tu restes avec moi.
Allez, Jake.
Reste avec moi Jake.
Allez mec.
Reste avec moi.
Allez !
OK, faut que tu continues.
Faut que t'avances.
Me faites pas de mal...
Mimi ?
C'est Gail et Johnston Green, trésor.
Tu es sauvée.
Merci mon Dieu !
Viens chérie,
allons-nous-en.
Allez.
Ils sont affreux.
Ce sont les draps
de ton ancien appartement ?
Parce que personne
ne peut dormir avec ça.
Si quelqu'un nous demande,
on dira qu'on nous les a donnés.
Ta robe.
Je suis pas censé la voir, hein ?
Il semblerait que la date
soit déjà passée, alors...
On en trouvera une autre.
Tu le penses vraiment ?
Oui.
Il me reste un paquet
de nouilles chinoises
avec ton nom dessus,
qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
Génial. J'apporte ça à l'abri,
je reviens, je me passe un coup d'eau.
Roger, attends.
Je t'accompagne.
C'est Maman et Papa, chéri !
Stanley, ça va, trésor ?
Va dans le camion
te réchauffer, l'ami.
- Où est Mimi ?
- Je suis là.
Stanley, je suis là.
Réveille-toi, réveille-toi.
Réveille-toi, Jake.
Réveille-toi.
Réveille-toi. Merci mon Dieu.
On va te sortir de là, chéri.
On a vu la tempête arriver,
on a commencé à s'inquiéter
quand on t'a pas vu revenir.
Chérie...
Chérie,
on n'arrivera pas
à dégager ce camion.
Il faut que tu les ramènes en ville
et que tu nous ramènes de l'aide.
Lance un signal en revenant,
je saurai que c'est toi, OK ?
- Des appels de phares.
- Très bien, vas-y !
Jake, regarde-moi, fiston.
Je suis là.
Tu vas t'en sortir, fiston...
Je te connais.
Je sais par quoi t'es passé.
Tu vas t'en sortir.
Tu vas t'en sortir.
Reste avec moi.
Robert, s'il te plaît,
les enfants sont endormis.
- Désolé.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous, bon sang ?
Je suis désolé.
Jake, tu seras bientôt à la maison,
mais il faut que
tu restes éveillé. Allez.
Abandonne-moi.
Laisse-moi tout seul.
Non, j'irai nulle part.
Mais il faut que tu t'accroches.
Ils devraient plus tarder, maintenant.
Papa.
Je suis désolé.
Fiston, t'as pas à t'excuser.
Ouvre les yeux, Jake.
Tiens bon.
Regarde-moi.
Regarde-moi, Jake.
Je la revois.
Voir qui ?
La fille.
Quelle... fille ?
Jake, je pense
que tu hallucines, fiston.
Non, écoute-moi.
Quand j'étais en Irak...
il y avait une fille.
Elle devait pas avoir plus de...
10 ou 12 ans...
Arrête de parler, fiston.
Économise tes forces.
On parlera quand on... rentrera.
Je l'ai tuée, Papa.
J'ai tué une petite fille.
Dépêchez-vous !
Ouvre les yeux, Jake.
Ouvre les yeux.
OK, tout le monde, à 3...
Un,
deux, trois !
C'est bon, il est libre.
Approchez la planche.
Un, deux, trois.
T'avais raison.
Il faut que j'éloigne ma famille
de moi dès que possible.
J'ai réfléchi, et...
Il n'y a pas d'autre solution.
T'as fait le bon choix.
Écoute.
Dès qu'ils seront en sécurité,
toi et moi devons
reprendre du service.
La moitié de l'équipe
est morte, Sarah,
et quiconque a fait ça,
a une bonne raison de le faire.
Comment tu vas le dire à Darcy ?
Je lui dirai après
les avoir déménagés.
Elle refusera si elle sait
que je ne reste pas avec eux.
Il est mieux ici
qu'au centre médical.
On est toujours sur le courant
de secours, il fait plus chaud ici.
Tiens, chéri.
Et ses blessures ?
La blessure à la tête
n'est pas profonde,
et ses jambes ne sont pas cassées.
Il a eu beaucoup de chance.
Je suis gelé.
Je vais te chercher
d'autres couvertures.
Tu es en état d'hypothermie.
Il faudra quelques heures
pour que ta température se stabilise.
- Vous pouvez nous laisser une minute ?
- Bien sûr.
Papa...
Ce que je t'ai dit là-bas...
Je t'en prie, oublie-le.
Je t'en prie.
J'ai bien peur que ce soit impossible.
J'ai vu beaucoup de choses
dans ma vie, Jake.
J'ai vu la guerre.
Je sais ce qu'elle peut faire.
Je sais ce que les hommes
peuvent faire. De terribles...
terribles choses.
Je sais ce que j'ai fait.
Tu peux me parler.
Quand tu seras prêt, fiston.
Quand tu seras prêt.
Tu vas bien ?
Comment va ton entorse ?
Ça serait mieux avec des antidouleurs,
mais je vais pas me plaindre.
Tu sais, un moment, j'ai bien cru
que je ne sentirais plus jamais rien.
Quand j'étais là-bas,
pendant un moment,
je ne pensais pas m'en sortir.
Alors je me suis... endormie.
Et j'avais plus envie de bouger.
Mais tu l'as fait.
Tu l'as fait.
Et je savais que tu le ferais.
Tes lèvres sont toujours froides.
Peut-être que tu pourrais
les réchauffer.
On m'a jamais aussi mal draguée.
Je me doute, mais je peux faire pire.
- La ferme.
- OK.
Demain matin...
on part.
On part ? Pour aller où ?
Je ne sais pas encore.
Tu ne sais pas ?
Darcy, quand je suis venu
vous chercher à Washington...
je t'ai dit que vous n'étiez
pas en sécurité,
mais je ne pouvais pas
te dire pourquoi.
Je vais faire un tour.
J'ai quelque chose en ma possession.
Et il y a des gens là dehors
qui le convoitent,
que rien n'arrêtera pour l'obtenir.
Et ça nous met,
toi, moi et les enfants,
en danger.
OK, alors on... on part.
<i>Je te fais confiance.</i>
<i>Robert, est-ce que...</i>
Est-ce que tu me fais confiance ?
- Vous êtes en retard.
- Vous êtes impatient.
Alors, écoute-moi.
Sarah n'est pas de notre côté.
Qu'importe ce qu'il...
s'est passé entre vous deux,
je t'assure, Robert,
elle n'est pas là pour nous aider.
Vous avez localisé le paquet ?
Bientôt.
Hawkins commence à
assembler les pièces du puzzle.
- Il faut l'éliminer.
- Je sais.
Nous avons déjà éliminé
les trois autres cibles sans incident.
Pourquoi celle-ci prend plus de temps ?
Parce que celle-ci est différente.

Previously on Jericho
<i>Bring them inside.</i>
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>
<i>that landed in
the middle of nowhere.</i>
<i>They've been walking
for weeks.</i>
<i>They must have gone
through hell.</i>
<i>Oh, my God... Roger.</i>
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>
<i>You need to keep
them clean and warm.</i>
<i>Do you know anyone
in Jericho?</i>
<i>Actually... I do.</i>
<i>Hello, Rob.</i>
<i>We're using the generator
to power the town hall</i>
<i>for three hours a day,
the Med Center for six.</i>
<i>With 53 new people, at current
levels of consumption...</i>
<i>we will be completely out
of gas and diesel in two weeks.</i>
<i>- Mrs. Green?
- What?</i>
<i>Eric told me that
April's pregnant.</i>
<i>It's the Old Man.</i>
<i>He's coming for us
using us against each other.</i>
<i>We go see him and if,
if he is behind this,</i>
<i>We take him out.</i>
<i>We leave first thing
in the morning.</i>
<i>Any luck out there?</i>
Sorry, ma'am.
Nothing?
Not even rabbits?
Never seen anything
like it before.
Nothing moving out there.
Think it was the fallout? Maybe it was
the radiation that killed the deer.
There'd still be dead animals,
carcasses, something.
I mean, it was weird.
Like all the game had vanished.
How far out
did you go?
15 miles out by Mill Pond
along the creek there.
Guess we're going to have
to drive, huh, Jake?
Yeah, but we have to be careful
about burning the gas rations
in the middle of winter.
We need everything we can
to run the generator.
We can live without
power for now.
Make fires to stay warm.
But we won't see Spring
if we don't eat.
Stanley and I will have to use
whatever gas we can spare.
and go out west,
Go out as far as it takes.
The rest of the hunting parties
will have to scrounge around locally.
Yeah, and Mimi's coming
with us.
What?
Well, in case something happens to me,
I want to make sure she knows...
how to trap and shoot, okay?
Look, the further you get
the hairier the roads are.
With food being
as scarce as it is,
there's bound to be
some trouble out there.
That sleeping bag's
rated to 40 below
and here's a wind-proof lighter for you.
You're going to need them both.
Good hunting.
I'm guessing the good folks
of Jericho don't know
about all this stuff down here.
- They don't know about a lot of things.
That'll be enough to get us
to the Old Man's place?
He is only about
two hours away.
I didn't realize
he was so close.
He chose the rally point.
Wanted it in his backyard.
How long as he been
watching you?
My guess...
since I stopped communications
a few days ago.
You worried about what we're
going to find out there?
- You're not.
- We can handle him.
It's you and me.
Let's get to work.
My grandmother
went fast than this
and she didn't
even have a car.
We have to take it easy,
we only have half a tank.
Well, hopefully we'll make it
to Flint Springs. It's got...
Hopefully? What do you
mean "hopefully"?
It's got a river.
It's prime white-tailed terrain.
I know, but...
This is crazy.
I told you that
I can't hunt.
Now you want me to kill Bambi.
You're gonna have to
learn, all right?
Everyone's doing their part.
Bonnie's been out twice.
Well, good for
frickin' Bonnie.
Bonnie grew up on farm.
The closest I ever got
to the outdoors
was the is the Ralph Lauren
section of Neiman Marcus.
There you go,
bargain hunting.
Same thing, but with a gun.
Bargains? At Neimans?
Sometimes I forget
that the biggest designer
in your closet is Wrangler.
What are you
laughing at?
I've never seen you in a
domestic squabble before.
Knock it off.
This isn't squabbling.
Oh, my God.
These dogs have tags.
Look at all this.
Wall Drugs.
Wall, South Dakota.
Do you think that's where all
these people were coming from?
Think about it.
South Dakota without heat,
electricity, or...
food being trucked in.
It's got to be even worse
in North Dakota,
Montana.
Oh, my God.
I read about this
at Blackjack.
Mass migration, hundreds...
maybe thousands of people
heading south.
Trying to outrun winter.
Should we be doing
that, too?

How far is it?
...60.
It's about 60 yards.
So 60 yard with almost
1.5 people per yard.
That's 90.
That's almost 100 people
just across.
The way the ground
is trampled,
you got to figure five
or tens times that amount
of people came through here.
Almost a thousand people?
Where are they going?
South Texas, Mexico.
Anyplace warmer.
It'd take weeks
to get there by foot.
God know how many thousand
people have the same idea.
Mexico's borders
could be closed.
We don't even know if
there still is a Mexico.
Maybe we should try
to catch on with them.
We can barely feed ourselves,
let alone... hundreds more.
We got to keep going.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Hey. Glad you came down.
Thank you.
- What time did you, uh...
- Early...
late, I guess.
I didn't want to wake you,
you looked so peaceful.
Peaceful? Really?
Did you have another one of those
bad dreams? Keep on there.
I guess neither one of
us got much sleep.
All I could do was think about
all these people down here, you know.
And then I remembered about the
clothes we had in the attic.
I thought that sweater
looked familiar.
Yeah, that woman was on
layover in Kansas City
when the bombs went off,
Her husband and two kids
were waiting for her at home.
Where?
Denver.
I lead these people here.
For better or worse
this is their home now.
It's on me to make sure
they're taken care of.
Yeah, of course.
What can I do to help, huh?
Talk to them,
follow your instincts.
The truth is...
I'm winging this myself.
I'll be outside.
Here.
Should be back
before dark.
And if you're not?
Just tell me when I
should start to worry.
This is the last time,
okay?
After today
I'm here...
for good, huh?
Okay.
I'll hold you to that.
Hi, honey.
How'd it go this morning?
The whole thing
was a bust.
I'm sorry, hon.
Jake's out there now.
Hopefully he and Stanley
will have better luck
than I did.
Is April here?
No, she's at
the clinic.
She promised me
she'd take a nap.
I hope it is warmer in that
clinic than it is in this house.
I think this house has
dropped ten degrees
in the last hour.
Feels like a storm's
coming in.
We'd better seal up these
windows the best was we can.
Been going around collecting
old sheets and linens.
We'll shove them
underneath the doors.
Look what I found...
hidden in Jake's closet.
Lord knows how long
that's been there.
Well, at least he was
drinking the good stuff.
I used to hide the most awful
rotgut in the world
behind my mother's
china cabinet.
What do you think?
On an empty stomach?
I'll get the glasses.
Why would anyone destroy all this.
If they'd wanted it out of commission,
they could have just taken it.
Be worth a fortune after the E.M.P.
Maybe there wasn't time,
or maybe they didn't
care about this stuff.
- How long?
- A couple of days...
Give or take.
But we just heard
from him yesterday.
We heard from someone.
Remote uplink.
Somebody else using
his access codes.
Who could have done this?
Wager for the first kill.
I'm in for a dozen eggs.
Two hours chopping wood.
Tax return consultation.
Oh, how about
foot massages for a week?
For me, not for him.
We'll talk.
Stanley, stop.
- What are they doing?
- They're blocking the whole road.
More like staking it out.
All right, turn around.
And... and go where?
I don't know. Just do it, all right?
Turn around. We'll find another road.
I see it. Damn it.
Why are they following us?
Stanley, gun it!
This should get us
back to the highway.
Then what?
We try to make it back home,
find the patrol.
Maybe they'll give up by then
or run out of gas.
Yeah, if we don't first.
Stanley...
Stanley, hold on!
Doesn't look like
he put up much of a fight.
He was probably out
before he knew what hit him.
He must have trusted whoever did it.
The thing is, whoever it was,
they knew what
they were doing there,
not over here.
I mean, look at this.
It's a mess.
But the drives...
They look like they're still intact.
The old man had information
on the entire team...
Contact information,
backgrounds...
Last known whereabouts.
Let's find out where everybody is.
We can't outrun them.
- How far till Jericho?
- Too far.
Oh, God!
Stay down.
Stay down.
Give me that drive you got there.
Must feel good to be back
in the saddle, huh?
I wish we didn't have
to come out here in the first place.
What, are you getting soft on me?
Too much domestic bliss?
Not quite bliss.
There.
There it is. We're in.
Thank you.
Karaoke bullfighter, right?
Excuse me?
At that bar in Barcelona.
You decked a bullfighter who tried
to get you to stop singing that song...
"Stairway to Heaven"?
Did Roger tell you that?
He also mentioned you like Oreo,
ice cream and white daisies.
Don't be mad at him.
He was trying to keep us entertained.
He kept talking and,
somehow, we kept moving.
Hey. How you doing?
I'm a little tired.
I'm going to head home
and get cleaned up.
Think I'll stay here for a
little longer if you don't mind.
Yeah. Of course.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Looks like you owe
these folks a rematch.
So, um...
I will see you when I see you.
- To Jake.
- To Jake.
Who would have thought,
six months ago, you'd be toasting him?
Well, God knows Eric wouldn't
have hidden the bottle.
You and Jake have always
had much more in common
than you wanted to admit.
You going hunting
all those weekends...
Why that kid got sit
in a deer stand for hours?
We wouldn't say a word
to each other. Just...
be in the woods together.
I was always afraid that Jake
would forget about that.
You know, that he'd grow up only
remembering the bad times. That we were
That he wouldn't remember
that we had been close.
That we were... buddies once.
He remembers...
deep down.
That's why you mean
so much to him.
Boy, that wind sounds awful.
I hope Stanley and Jake
are okay out there.
What happened?
Jake, Stanley's not moving.
- What?
- Stanley's not moving.
Oh, my God. Go hide.
- Go hide.
- No
- Go on.
- No, No. Stanley...
You'll be fine.
Go! Go hide!
Come on.
Help me with Stanley.
I can't move.
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.
That's half the team.
We're being hunted.
It's worse than that.
It's Woodworth and his wife.
They were in Richmond.
That's his daughter.
Anyone close to us
is in danger, too.
No loose ends.
Don't worry about your family.
We're not going to let
anything happen to them.
It's just us, Chavez
and Cheung left.
We'll get back out on the field,
stay in the weeds
until we can connect
with the chief.
Here. Look at this.
What is that?
If we are being hunted,
there... is the hunter.
Stanley, are you okay?
Can you get up?
Your leg?
I think I busted my ankle.
I'm okay.
I'm just stuck.
- Let me try to get this off.
- Stanley, don't.
We can't do this ourselves.
You might make it worse.
Maybe you could dig me out.
All right.
Help me get the shovels. They're in
the bed of the truck.
It's gone.
All right, get the jack.
The jack's back there.
They took everything.
How was your bath?
Lukewarm, then luke-cold,
then pretty much icy.
- Look. Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.
Times Square,
New Year's Eve, 2005.
Wasted.
That hangover was epic.
Do you remember the last thing I said to
you the night before you left Jericho ?
That I was selfish
and I didn't listen?
Something like that?
You have no idea how that ate
at me while you were gone.
- I just kept thinking that was
the last  - You were right.
You know, today,
seeing you with those people...
It was like you had found yourself.
I'm still just trying to figure
it out, you know?
We're not these people anymore.
But I'll tell you the one thing
that hasn't changed.
The one constant.
I love you.
And it's going
to take a whole lot more
than the end of the world
to change that.
- How are your legs?
- I don't know I can't feel anything.
The ground's
frozen solid.
It's sucking the heat
right out of you.
Why can't we build a fire?
You smell the fumes?
You have to get back to town.
All right. I'm going
to try and go.
No. You can't on that ankle.
- I'll go.
- No. Those guys are still out there.
They went the other way.
Jericho has a patrol
five miles out of town.
We can't have come
more than ten.
Jake, it's too dangerous.
What are our options?
With no bags, no fire?
All right, one of you goes
or we all die here.
All right, fine, fine.
I threw a flashlight over there
somewhere. You might need it.
Listen...
stay on the shoulder
the whole time, okay?
If you see any headlights
or you hear any engines,
get low and hide,
all right?
Now, you're gonna
want to head
southeast.
Stanley, that doesn't mean
anything to me.
Stay on this road.
Stay on this road
and then you make...
make your first left
Okay?
And you're gonna go about a mile
and then you're gonna make
your second right,
and you're gonna make another right
and then another left.
And then once you get to the crossroads
of the highway, you're home free...
You'll see a big sign pointing
to the way to Jericho, okay?
Got it?
Left, second right.
Right, left,
Right.
Mimi, I...
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.
<i>Here's what we're gonna do:</i>
I know a place that's safe.
We take Darcy and the kids
out of Jericho
and stash them before you and I
get back on the move.
I am not leaving them alone.
- I don't think you have a choice.
- No...
See, because I've got leverage.
If they kill me, they will
never find the package.
It's not you
they're gonna kill.
It'll be Sam
or Darcy or me;
anything they can use
to get to you.
Anything they can
use to get to me.
The body.
These... These, uh...
...these half-smashed drives,
<i>...this whole...</i>
this whole setup--
If someone had wanted
to destroy all this,
why leave the house
standing, huh?
Why not just burn it all down?
Someone wanted us
to see all this.
We're being played.
Why would anyone go through
all that trouble?
I don't know,
but this is all too big now.
There's too many angles
to cover.
Too many unknowns.
I need to get home.
- Robert, wait.
- What?
Let's think about this.
What's the plan?
What are you going to do?
You know, maybe the plan all
along was to get us out here.
I gotta protect
my family, Sarah.
And what about the package?
It'll need to be moved.
This isn't so bad, right?
Hey, we've been
through worse.
Remember the time we got stuck on
the roof of the...
town hall in the middle
of a lightning storm, huh?
We were so afraid the lightning
was going to...
blow up the fireworks.
You squealed like a little girl
wanting to jump off that roof.
That was you.
Your voice hadn't changed yet.
Please, I had you beat by,
like, six months.
Drink some water.
It's frozen right through.
What?
I saw an abandoned cabin about
a quarter mile up the road.
You need to get inside.
It'll hurt, but you can make it.
- Jake, I'm staying.
- Listen to me!
There's no point in both of us
freezing to death out there.
- She's coming back.
- When?
She's been gone for, like,
an hour.
It'll take her a little while to
reach the patrol,
but when she does,
she'll find someone.
I know she'll find someone.
Unless somebody finds her first.
Look,
it's gonna get dark soon,
you need to go.
You wouldn't leave me
any more than I'm leaving you.
Mimi's strong.
She'll find her way.
Wait...
he said keep going east.
No... southeast.
And... look for a sign.
Oh, God, I hate this place!
Come on, man.
You can't fall asleep.
You got to stay up;
come on.
You stopped shivering.
Come on.
You got to talk to me--
come on, come on, buddy.
You gotta talk to me.
Talk to me, buddy.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
About what?
Five years ago.
Sorry I left the way I did.
Iit's okay. It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
I was gonna call.
I was gonna call.
I know. Listen, I want you
to forget about it, okay?
We never got to go backpacking
in Costa Rica.
You know what?
We're still gonna get to go
backpacking in Costa Rica, okay?
We're gonna...
we're gonna learn how to surf.
We're gonna sleep
on the beach.
As soon as the planes
are up and running again,
it's gonna be you and me.
Hell, you can fly us
there yourself, huh?
Come on. Come on.
Tell me something good, man.
I haven't talked to you in five years.
You've been gone for five years.
Tell me... Hey, tell me
about San Diego.
How was it?
- Warm.
- Warm, right.
Beaches, blondes, huh?
What were you doing there?
Flying, flying planes.
Really?
That's cool, man.
Your grandfather
would've been psyched, huh?
Did you have a girl there?
I know you had a girl.
She's dead.
What do you mean?
You don't know that.
I mean, it all depends on where she was
when the bombs went off, right?
I mean, she could
have made it, right?
- Tell me what her name was.
- She's dead....
It was my fault.
- It's not your fault.
- Let me lay down.
- Jake, no.
- Let me lay down.
It wasn't your fault.
Come on... Come on...
Come on, stay with me.
You gotta stay with me.
Come on, Jake.
Stay with me, Jake.
Come on, man.
Stay with me.
Come on!
Okay, gotta keep moving.
Gotta keep moving.
Please don't hurt me...
please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me!
Please don't hurt me...
Mimi?
- It's Gail and Johnston Green, honey.
You're safe.  - Oh, thanks God!
Come on, baby,
let's get out of here.
Come on.
Those are hideous.
Are those the sheets
from your old apartment?
Because you can't expect
anyone to sleep on those.
If anyone asks, we'll pretend
someone else donated them.
Your dress.
Guess I shouldn't be seeing this, huh?
The day's sort of come and gone, so...
It'll come again.
You think?
I do.
I tell you what, I've got
a pack of Ramen noodles
with your name on it,
what do you say?
Great. I'll deliver this to the shelter
and come back and wash up.
Roger, wait.
I'll come with you.
It's Mom and Dad, honey!
Stanley, you all right, sweetheart?
You need to go get in the truck
and get warm, pal.
- Where's Mimi?
- I'm right here.
Stanley, I'm right here.
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up, Jake.
Wake up.
Wake up. Oh, thank God.
We're gonna help you, honey.
We saw the storm coming
and we started to worry
when you hadn't come back.
Sweetheart...
Honey,
we're not gonna be able
to get this truck off of him.
I need you to take
these guys back to town
and get me some help out here.
You signal when you're coming back
so I know it's you, all right?
- I'll flash the lights.
- All right, go, go, go!
Jake, look at me, son.
Lookie here.
You're gonna make it, son...
I know you.
I know what you're made of.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna make it.
Stay with me now.
Robert, please,
the kids are sleeping.
- I'm sorry.
- What on earth are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jake, you'll be home real soon,
but you got to stay
with me now. Come on.
Leave me here.
Leave me alone.
Now, I'm not going anywhere.
But you got to hang on.
Now, they'll be here soon, son.
Dad...
I'm sorry.
Oh, son, you got nothing
to be sorry about.
Open your eyes, Jake.
Come on, now.
Look at me.
Look at me, Jake.
I can see her.
See who?
The girl.
What... girl?
Jake, I think you're hallucinating, son.
No, listen to me.
When I was in Iraq...
... there was a girl.
She couldn't have been more than...
10 or 12...
Don't talk now, son.
You save your energy.
We'll talk when we get... home.
I killed her, Dad.
I killed a little girl.
Hurry up!
Open your eyes, Jake.
Open your eyes.
All right, everyone on three...
One,
two, three!
All right, he's free.
Let's get the board in here.
One, two, three.
You were right.
I need to get my family
as far away from me as possible.
I've been thinking, and...
There's no other choice.
You're doing the right thing.
Listen.
After they're safe,
you and me need
to get back in the field.
That's half our team gone, Sarah,
and whoever did that
did it for a reason.
How are you gonna tell Darcy?
I'll tell her after I've moved them.
She'll never agree if she knows
I won't be staying with them.
He's better off here
than the med center.
We're still on emergency power,
and it's... it's warmer here.
Here, honey.
What about his injuries?
Well, the cut on his head
isn't very deep,
and neither one
of his legs are broken.
He's very lucky.
I'm freezing.
I'm gonna go get you
some more blankets.
You're still hypothermic.
It's just gonna take a few hours
for your body to stabilize.
- Can we have a minute?
- Oh, sure.
Dad...
What I told you out there...
please forget it.
Please.
Afraid I can't do that.
I've seen a lot of things
in my time, Jake.
I've been to war.
I know what war can do.
I know what men can do... Terrible...
... terrible things.
I know what I did.
You can talk to me.
When you're ready, son.
When you're ready.
You okay?
How's the sprain?
I think it'd be better with painkillers,
but I'm not gonna complain.
You know, for a while there, I didn't
think I'd ever feel anything again.
When I was out there,
just for a moment,
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.
And I stopped... to rest.
And then I just didn't
even want to move.
But you did.
You did make it.
And I knew you would.
Your lips are still cold.
Maybe you can warm them.
That's the worst line
I've ever heard.
I know. I've got others.
- Shut up.
- Okay.
Tomorrow morning...
we're leaving.
We're leaving?
For... for where?
I don't know yet.
You don't know?
Darcy, when I came
to get you in DC...
I told you it wasn't safe,
but I couldn't tell you why.
I'm going for a walk.
I have something
in my possession.
And there's people
out there that want it,
that will stop at nothing to get it.
And that puts you,
me and the kids
in danger here.
Okay, so th... then we go.
<i>I trust you.</i>
<i>Robert, do y...</i>
Do you trust me?
- You're late.
- You're impatient.
Then listen to me.
Okay, Sarah is not on our side.
Now... whatever's...
gone on between the two of you,
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.
Have you located the package?
Soon.
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
We've already eliminated the other
three targets without incident.
Why are you stalling on this one?
Because this one is different.

<i>Précédemment dans </i>Jericho
Certains étaient en avion
et se sont posés au
milieu de nulle part.
Ils ont marché des semaines.
Ils ont dû vivre l'enfer.
Oh mon Dieu... Roger.
Il y a une femme
dans ce groupe de réfugiés
que Bill interroge.
Tu devrais lui parler.
Salut, Rob.
Quelqu'un de mon équipe
nous a vendus.
Tu devrais savoir qu'ils sont prêts à
tout pour te faire parler.
<i>"On se sert de sa famille"</i>
Avec notre consommation actuelle,
nous serons à court de carburant
dans 2 semaines.
On peut vivre sans énergie,
mais on passera pas
l'hiver sans manger.
Bon, plus vous irez loin,
plus les routes seront dangereuses.
La nourriture se faisant rare...
il y aura des risques là-bas.
Mais pourquoi nous suivent-ils ?
Stanley, attention !
Jake !
C'est Maman et Papa, chéri.
Tu vas t'en sortir.
Alors, on m'observe ?
C'est le Vieil Homme.
Il veut nous monter
l'un contre l'autre.
S'ils me tuent, ils ne trouveront
jamais le paquet.
Je possède quelque chose...
que d'autres convoitent.
Et ça nous met, toi, moi et les
enfants... en danger.
Écoute-moi bien...
Sarah n'est pas de notre côté.
Je te préviens, Robert,
elle n'est pas là pour nous aider.
Hawkins commence à rassembler
les pièces du puzzle.
Il doit être éliminé.
- Je sais.
- Alors pourquoi c'est si long ?
Parce qu'il est différent.
Tu n'arriveras pas au Kansas
avec si peu d'essence,
et tu ne trouveras pas
de nourriture là-bas.
Ceux qui sont partis la semaine dernière
sont probablement déjà en Arizona.
S'ils n'ont pas été tués sur la route.
C'est du suicide de partir, Ridley.
On n'a ni nourriture, ni chauffage.
C'est du suicide de rester.
<i>Voilà tout ce qu'on a...</i>
dans chaque ferme.
Jusqu'aux prochaines récoltes,
donc pas avant plusieurs mois.
Et si on ne compte pas les réfugiés ?
Ils habitent ici, maintenant.
Ça fait beaucoup de
bouches à nourrir.
Ils nous ont aidés, Gray.
À la chasse, pour
la coupe du bois...
Ils consomment 5 fois plus vite
qu'ils ne récoltent.
Quand nous aurons les éoliennes,
les problèmes d'essence
seront résolus.
Et jusque-là ?
Ridley et son groupe vont partir.
Si les gens n'en font qu'à leur tête,
c'est leur droit.
Tu sais aussi bien que moi
qu'au printemps,
on retrouvera leurs corps.
Et que veux-tu que je fasse,
Johnston ?
Qu'est-ce que j'ai raté
sur ce tableau ?
Dites-moi, car je ne vois pas.
Sans prendre de
nouvelles mesures,
on ne passera pas l'hiver.
Du moins, pas nous tous.
On doit prendre
des décisions difficiles.
Et je pense que les derniers arrivés
devraient être les premiers à partir.
Dégagez les rues !
Il faut dégager les rues !
Qui est le responsable ici ?
Je suis Gray Anderson,
le Maire de Jericho.
Enchanté, Maire Anderson.
Je suis le Sergent Hill,
4ème division de Marines,
4ème Bataillon de Blindés,
Compagnie Charlie.
Donc vous êtes...
Monsieur,
nous sommes des Marines américains,
et nous venons vous aider.

Ils ont envoyé les Marines ?
Nous nous déployons dans l'ouest du
Kansas pour établir des bases
et préparer l'arrivée du corps
du Génie militaire.
Maintenant que nous avons gagné la
guerre, il est temps de reconstruire.
Quelle guerre ?
- Vous n'êtes pas au courant ?
- Non.
Les communications sont
coupées depuis l'EMP.
Bon, nous avons atomisé la Corée
du Nord ainsi que l'Iran.
Ils étaient derrière tout ça ?
D'après le peu que je sais,
c'est l'Iran qui a financé,
les Nord-Coréens ont
fourni les bombes.
Nous recherchons activement les
terroristes qui ont participé,
mais nous avons retrouvé
les organisateurs.
Que va-t-il se passer
maintenant ?
La plus grosse reconstruction
dans l'histoire du pays.
Donc nous avons un
dirigeant finalement ?
L'ancien secrétaire du HHS
est devenu président.
Nous avons entendu dire qu'il y avait
6 prétendants et autant de capitales.
C'est réglé.
Le gouvernement fédéral s'est
réunifié à Columbus, Ohio.
Comment ont-il choisi
Columbus ?
Je sais seulement que
mes ordres
viennent de l'officier de
commandement du 4ème Bataillon.
Et les ordres sont de rétablir
la lumière...
l'électricité et les infrastructures
du Kansas, une ville après l'autre.
Pour quand est-ce prévu ?
Vous aurez le plein de nourriture et les
pieds au chaud d'ici la fin de l'année.
Bienvenue dans le monde
à nouveau, Jericho.
Merci mon Dieu pour
les Marines US.
C'est fini !
Il y a des enfants ici,
trouvez une chambre !
Allez. On aurait déjà
dû partir hier.
C'est bon, je suis prête.
Salut. Je viens de
faire le plein.
Où en êtes-vous ?
Nous serons prêts
quand il faudra.
Je vais chercher le reste
de mes affaires en bas.
Combien de fois on va encore être
obligé de déménager ?
- Cette fois c'est la bonne.
- Vraiment ?
Tu vas pouvoir rester au même
endroit à partir de maintenant ?
Sergent Green.
Corps des Marines ?
Mon Dieu non.
Les Rangers.
Bon, je vais essayer de ne
pas vous en tenir rigueur.
Alors, Gunny, combien de temps
avant que le Génie soit ici ?
Peut-être deux jours,
ou deux semaines.
Mais avant, dressez la liste
de vos besoins, et je...
la transmettrai au QG du
bataillon à Dodge City,
et nous allons commencer à vous
remettre à flot.  - Bien reçu.
On peut vous être d'une
aide quelconque ?
Un poste de commandement ?
- Prenez le bureau du Sherif.
- Parfait.
Excusez-moi.
Si vous restez dans
le coin un moment,
vos hommes sont les bienvenus
dans ma taverne.
Merci, madame.
Ils en seront ravis.
Wymore !
Avant et centre !
On y va, on y va !
Rassemblement et suivez
cette jeune femme.
Malgré ce parfum de liberté,
souvenez-vous...
comportez-vous en Marines.
- Oui Monsieur.
Ne m'appelez pas "Monsieur",
Première classe.
Je ne suis pas d'active.
Rompez !
A vos ordres,
Sergent Artilleur.
Il y a deux mois, il aurait fait des
pompes jusqu'à dégueuler, mais...
ils en ont bavé.
Je comprends.
Nous pouvons faire autre chose ?
Et bien, Sergent...
il y a bien quelque chose.
Caporal Mullin !
Je recherche des pièces
de rechange.
Notre radio, elle a un peu morflé.
Vous savez ou je
peux demander ?
Je peux peut-être aider.
Caporal Mullin.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
Donc vous êtes leur expert
en électronique ?
Je ne suis pas expert en quoi que
ce soit, mais je sais improviser.
Ça me va.
Allons voir ce qu'on
peut trouver.
<i>"J'ai bientôt le paquet"</i>
<i>"J'ai bientôt le paquet"
"Je vous tient au courant"</i>
Bon...
J'ai bien réfléchi...
Peut être que laisser
ma famille...
n'est pas une si bonne idée.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi ? On en a
déjà parlé. Ils...
ils sont en danger à tes côtés.
Je sais.
Il y a des gens dehors
qui veulent...
les blesser pour m'atteindre.
Mais au moins, je
connais le danger.
Je peux les protéger.
Tu n'es pas logique.
C'est ma famille, Sarah.
Ça n'a jamais été
important pour toi.
Maintenant ça l'est.
Va-t-il falloir que...
quelqu'un égorge ta femme
avant que tu acceptes ?
Tu as raison.
On les laissera à la planque,
et nous continuerons
notre chemin.
C'est ce qui est le
mieux pour eux.
Je viens de réaliser...
Si le gouvernement est
à nouveau en place,
tu sais ce que ça signifie, hein ?
- Non.
Paperasse.
Il vont avoir besoin
de comptables.
C'est le retour de
mes dettes ?
Ne sois pas si négatif.
New York n'a pas été touchée.
Viens l'été prochain,
je t'emmènerai te promener
dans Central Park.
Quoi ?
Hé mec !
C'est trop fort !
Je pourrais devenir un marine.
J'ai hâte de voir ça...
excepté en ce qui
te concerne.
Ne t'inquiète pas pour elle.
C'est juste un passage,
crois-moi.
Dès que tout sera rentré
dans l'ordre,
ce sera aussi bien qu'avant.
Peut-être que tu pourras l'emmener
quand tu repartiras pour New York.
Penser à quitter cette
ville n'est pas
la même chose que
penser te quitter.
Ben, ça revient au même, Mimi.
Peut-être que tu pourrais
venir avec moi.
Ouais, mais je suis désolé.
Ce n'est pas ma vie.
Et ici, ce n'est pas la mienne.
Tu m'as manqué.
Toi aussi.
On devrait y aller.
Commencer à charger le
camion, hein ?
Vas-y, sors d'ici.
On m'a dit ce qui s'était passé.
Tu vas bien ?
Ouais, je vais mieux
que le camion.
Est-ce qu'on va pouvoir arrêter de
s'inquiéter pour toi un de ces jours ?
C'est génial, hein ?
Ouais, de bonnes nouvelles.
Je vous vois plus tard.
A quoi ressemblent les
villes là-dehors ?
Disons que je n'ai rien vu de tel depuis
que nous sommes entrés dans la ZC.
"ZC" ?
Zone de Contamination.
Vous êtes dans la ZC-12,
et il y a bien pire qu'ici.
C'est dur à imaginer.
Faites un tour dans ce qui reste
des quartiers de Lawrence.
A quoi ça ressemble ?
Les immeubles
sont détruits.
Les survivants se battent
avec leurs voisins
pour la nourriture et l'eau.
À se demander si les survivants
sont les plus chanceux.
On a besoin d'un transistor
pour leur radio.
On peut les prendre
dans le jukebox ?
Vous allez me prendre
ma musique ?
Vous ne pouvez pas les
prendre ailleurs ?
Vous avez trois albums des
Spin Doctors là-dedans.
Croyez-moi, ça rendra
service à tout le monde.
Bon, il y a une vieille
radio à la mairie.
Peut-être que ce seront
les bonnes pièces.
- Merci quand même.
- Bye.
Salut, mon grand.
- Merci.
- De rien.
<i>"Avez-vous localisé le paquet ?"
<i>"Avez-vous localisé le paquet ?"
"Pas encore."</i>
<i>"Comment fait-on ?"</i>
<i>"Comment fait-on ?"
"On se sert de sa famille."</i>
Je pense que tu as quelque chose
qui m'appartient.
Chéri,
assieds-toi sur le canapé.
Ton papa et moi devons parler.
Vas-y, Sam.
Fais tes coloriages.
C'est ce que tu veux,
n'est-ce pas ?
Entre autres choses.
Tu m'as menti, Robert.
Quand es-tu retombé
amoureux de ta femme ?
T'inquiète pas.
Continue de colorier.
Allez.
On a instauré le rationnement
il y a quelque temps.
Mais il a fallu du temps
aux gens pour accepter
qu'on était livré à nous-mêmes.
Vous avez fait un meilleur boulot
que la plupart des autres villes.
Cette ville a la chance d'avoir
un militaire pour Maire.
On s'en est bien tiré.
Avec le sel de ma mine,
on a pu faire des échanges
avec les villes voisines.
Votre ville a l'air
de bien s'en sortir.
Ce qui veut dire que...
vous n'allez pas être
prioritaires sur la liste.
Attendez...
Quelle liste ?
Plusieurs détachements essayent de
répondre aux besoins urgents des villes.
Des aides sont apportées
aux plus démunis.
Attendez. Vous dites que...
le fait que l'on ait su s'organiser
va se retourner contre nous ?
On pourrait encore se débrouiller
seuls si on était obligés.
Facile à dire pour toi.
Tu n'es plus le responsable.
Donnez-moi la liste
de vos besoins, et...
je verrai ce que je peux faire.
Essayez celui-là.
Parfait.
Vous ne voulez vraiment pas
me dire ce qui s'est passé ?
Le docteur dit que ce
sont des engelures.
Et elle a aussi dit qui vous
avait botté les fesses ?
Quelqu'un nous a poursuivis.
Le reste est un peu flou.
On a simplement...
essayé de rester en vie,
vous voyez ?
Je vois.
- Alors, les Marines, hein ?
- Ouais.
C'est ce à quoi vous
vous attendiez ?
Ça dépend des moments.
Mais en signant, j'aurais jamais pensé
me battre contre des Américains.
Des gens bien,
forcés à faire des choses mauvaises.
Ça doit être difficile.
Je suis désolé.
C'est pas votre faute.
Quoi ?
C'est juste que...
je me demande pourquoi
quelqu'un comme vous s'est engagé.
Quelqu'un comme moi ?
J'avais un poste de bureau
il y a quelques années,
mais j'en avais marre.
Je voulais découvrir le monde.
- Et alors ?
- J'ai vu Omaha.
- Et vous ?
- Quoi, si j'ai vu le monde ? Ouais.
Mais j'ai seulement vu
les pires endroits.
Et bien...
vous êtes parfait dans ce rôle
d'obscur mauvais garçon.
Sur cette vidéo qu'on m'a envoyée
avant les attaques...
tu n'étais pas réellement
prisonnière.
Tu ne faisais...
Tu t'es foutue de moi ?
Me foutre de toi ?
On vivait ensemble.
Je me pointe ici
et tu as retrouvé ta famille.
C'est bon.
C'est juste une...
une histoire, tu vois ?
On raconte des histoires.
Continue de dessiner.
Tu m'as fait des promesses,
Robert.
C'était qui ces gens
sur la vidéo ?
Ceux pour qui tu bosses ?
Je bossais. Maintenant,
je suis à mon compte.
Pourquoi ne pas me donner
ce que je veux,
que cette histoire
se termine bien.
En fin de compte, les Marines
sont un moyen de...
d'échapper à la routine.
- J'essaie de pas y penser.
Ce qui veut dire
que vous y pensez.
Après tout ce que j'ai vu,
j'aimerais trouver
une petite ville sympa
et m'y installer à long terme.
Je ne pense pas que
ça existe encore.
Je viens d'en découvrir une.
Et vous ?
Vous pensez voler de nouveau ?
Pour l'armée peut-être ?
Bien sûr. C'est plus sûr que
de rester au sol, non ?
Pas en étant opérateur radio.
J'ai la meilleure place.
Je suis toujours dans le tank.
Si c'est vrai, pourquoi
la radio est dans cet état ?
Vous pensez qu'une fille
ne peut pas...
sortir botter quelques fesses
de temps en temps ?
Vous allez essayer d'appeler
qui avec ce truc ?
Le QG de la division
à Dodge City.
C'est à plus de 300 km.
Ce truc peut émettre plus loin.
Du moins, quand il est
en bon état.
4ème Division de Marines,
ici Première Section, Compagnie Charlie.

4ème Division de Marines,
ici Première Section, Compagnie Charlie.
Authentification "Foudre". Terminé.
<i>Lima Charlie Foudre.
Ici, la Compagnie Charlie.</i>
<i>On essaie de vous joindre
sur cette fréquence depuis des jours.</i>
<i>La Division a besoin du 4ème
bataillon de blindés RTB asap.</i>
<i>Reçu ?</i>
Parfaitement, Monsieur.
<i>Faites au plus vite, Caporal-Chef.</i>
Compris, terminé.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
On a reçu l'ordre de
rentrer à Dodge City.
Que vas-tu faire
de ce paquet, Sarah ?
Le vendre.
Et partir aussi loin
que possible.
Que t'est-il arrivé ?
Ces derniers mois,
j'ai appris deux choses...
que tout le monde a un prix...
et que tout le monde ment.
Reste assis, Sam.
- Prends ton...
- Reste là.
J'étais en pleine conversation
avec votre mari...
sur ce qui est le plus
important pour lui...
son boulot...
ou sa famille.
Pourquoi partez-vous ?
Parce qu'on en a reçu l'ordre.
Désolé mais je ne peux vous
révéler les ordres de mission.
Le Génie arrivera bientôt.
Bientôt ?
Quand ?
Écoutez Monsieur, j'en suis désolé,
mais je ne sais pas.
- Prêts à partir ?
- Paré, Gunny.
Mais pour le tank...
nous manquerons de carburant
pour retourner à Dodge City.
On le laisse ici...
et Sigloch et Kent restent
pour le surveiller.
Sergent, nous serons des proies
faciles pour les pirates.
Nous sommes des Marines.
On s'en sortira.
Je peux vous fournir
du carburant.
Pas beaucoup, mais assez
pour aller à Dodge.
Donnez-moi une heure.
Je vous écoute.
Et... toutes les provisions
dont vous avez besoin.
Mais j'ai besoin d'être assuré que
Jericho ne sera pas oubliée.
Trois C-130 avec des provisions de la
Croix Rouge arriveront dans 12 jours.
Je vous promets que vous serez
les premiers sur leur liste.
C'est tout ce que je demande.
Bon, les gars, écoutez-moi !
On va encore rester ici une heure.
Vous reviendrez avec les
troupes du Génie ?
Non.
Vous devrez vous satisfaire d'un
groupe d'hommes de terrain.
Et les membres du Génie
ne sont pas aussi mignons
que je le suis.
Vous devriez penser à...
revenir quand vous serez
démobilisée.
Qu'est ce que je ferais ici ?
C'est une question que nous
nous posons tous, mais...
vous saurez vous adapter.
Vous voyez,
avant que tout ça n'arrive,
j'aurais été d'accord avec vous.
Mais...
je ne reviendrai pas ici.
Caporal Mullin !
Oui, Sergent Artilleur.
Pourquoi votre équipement
n'est-il pas prêt ?
Ne répondez pas.
Nous sommes postés à la mairie.
Le maire veut nous
exprimer sa gratitude.
Quelqu'un doit rester ici.
Vous...
avez gagné à la courte paille.
À vos ordres, Gunny.
Je vais aller chercher
le reste des provisions
au bureau du shérif.
Va chercher le paquet.
Tu sais que je ne peux pas.
Tu penses que je vais te croire ?
Allez. On peut se sortir de
ce mauvais pas.
Tu as raté ta chance
de me suivre.
- S'il vous plaît !
- Fermez-la !
Vous allez perdre quelque chose
ce soir. Je vous le promets.
La seule question est,
est-ce que ce sera...
un être cher ?
Je vais chercher le paquet.
S'il te plaît, baisse ce flingue.
Vous pourriez descendre
avec Allison aussi ?
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
Ici la compagnie Charlie.</i>
<i>Nous recevez-vous ?</i>
<i>Lima Charlie,
ça caille vraiment ici.</i>
Allô ?
C'est Jake Green.
<i>Jake Green, c'est un canal
officiel des Marines.</i>
<i>Libérez la fréquence...</i>
Allô ?
Allô. Êtes-vous attaqués ?
Hep, Gunny !
C'est un petit quelque chose pour
vous souvenir de nous.
C'est vraiment gentil, M. le Maire,
mais nous devons y aller.
Non, vous ne pouvez pas
partir le ventre vide.
Rentrez, j'ai une petite
surprise pour vous.
Quelque chose pour vous prouver
notre gratitude. Venez.
Va chercher des gars
de la patrouille
et ratissez les environs, d'accord ?
Prenez des armes.
Tu te fiches de moi ?
Nous avons des Marines ici.
Il y quelque chose qui cloche
dans tout ça. Crois-moi.
D'accord...
Je cherche quoi ?
Pour commencer, quelqu'un
avec une radio.
Regardez partout d'où on peut
entendre les feux d'artifice.
Écoute, il n'y a peut-être rien.
Vérifie juste.
- D'accord ? Allez !
- Ok.
J'ai pas le temps.
C'est vraiment super
de vous parler.
Mesdames et messieurs...
Bienvenue, Mesdames et messieurs.
Chers invités...
J'aimerais vraiment que notre
ex-Sergent Green
puisse nous dire quelques mots.
Mesdames et messieurs...
Le corps des Marines
a une devise...
"Semper fidelis"
"Toujours fidèle"
Et ce doit être la providence qui,
dans ces heures sombres,
ce soit des Marines qui
viennent à notre secours.
Jamais auparavant dans
l'histoire de ce pays
une telle devise n'avait été
si appropriée...
et si indispensable.
Gunny, Marines,
Semper Fi.
Alors, Gunny, le Quatrième corps a
eu plus que sa part d'action.
Depuis Iwo jusqu'en Iraq, si il y
a une guerre, il y a le Quatrième.
Semper Fi.
Excusez-nous un instant.
De quoi s'agit-il ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
En bas.
J'ai...
J'ai entendu les feux d'artifice
dans la radio des Marines,
mais Dodge City est à
320 km d'ici.
- Quoi ?  - Ils ont quelqu'un
aux abords de la ville
qui se fait passer pour leur QG.
J'ai envoyé Stanley et deux de
nos gars pour aller vérifier.
Dis-moi que je délire.
Si tu délires,
alors moi aussi.
Personne n'appelle un
Sous-Officier "Monsieur",
et un Marine ne dirait
jamais "Hoo-ah"...
c'est un truc de l'armée.
Ces gars ont fait les deux.
Les Marines sont rigoureux
sur ce genre de détails.
Donc, si ce ne sont pas
des Marines... qui sont-ils ?
Des gars suffisamment armés
pour nous éliminer.
Et on leur a donné la moitié
de nos ressources.
Qu'est ce qu'on fait ?
On doit en parler à Gray.
Comment faire ?
Il est assis à côté d'eux.
Et il faut s'occuper du tank.
Si ce truc se met à tirer
dans la rue...
ca va être un bain de sang.
Même si vous neutralisez le tank, ils
ont toujours une salle remplie d'otages.
Elle a raison.
Retournez là-bas avant qu'ils
se posent des questions.
Essayez de le dire à Gray,
je vais attendre Stanley.
Je vais voir ce que je
peux faire pour le tank.
Comment on peut entendre les feux
d'artifice depuis Dodge City ?
On capte souvent plein
de parasites...
Arrête de me mentir !
<i>Allô ?
Il y a quelqu'un ?</i>
Stanley, c'est bien toi ?
<i>Jake, on a trouvé un
gars avec une radio.</i>
<i>Il dit qu'il est avec les Marines.</i>
<i>Je le ramène.</i>
Tout ça est vraiment réel ?
Le flingue l'est.
Je suis désolée.
Vous avez extorqué assez de nourriture
et de carburant pour aller ailleurs ?
Tu ne sais pas ce qui se
passe dehors.
Si, je sais.
Où vous avez eu
cet équipement ?
Avec le manque de nourriture, il y a
eu une émeute dans notre camp.
Une douzaine de Marines ne font pas le
poids face à 10000 personnes affamées.
Alors, vous les avez tués ?
Ils se sont enfuis et on a pris
ce qu'ils ont laissé.
On a tenté notre chance
dans la ville la plus proche.
Ça a si bien marché
qu'on a continué.
Non.
Vous ne partirez pas
avec votre butin.
Ne tente pas quelque chose
de stupide, Jake.
Je ne veux avoir pas ta mort
sur la conscience.
Je crois pas que tu en aies.
Ouvre-le.
Recule.
Mon Dieu.
- Elle est là depuis le début ?
- Elle n'est pas armée...
et le plomb bloque
les radiations...
- Tu as apporté ça dans notre maison ?
- D...
On avait presque réussi,
et tu lui as dit, Maggie?
Il avait tout découvert.
Il a entendu les feux
dans la radio.
- On fait quoi de lui ?
- C'est à dire ?
On part, tout simplement.
Et après...
on sera à peine à 1 km d'ici quand
tout le monde sera au courant !
Et ça recommencera
comme à Greenville.
On n'est pas des assassins.
J'étais un prof de sport
fana de cinéma.
Maintenant, je suis un Marine.
Je m'adapte.
- Non.
- C'est lui ou nous.
Ce sera vous.
Vous savez, les munitions sont
tellement rares,
ces armes ne sont surement
pas chargées.
Vous prenez le risque ?
Je suis sur que la mienne l'est.
Fils... de pute !
Les mains en l'air !
Levez-les !
Debout !
Comment osez-vous
porter cet uniforme !
Ce n'est pas un uniforme,
c'est un déguisement.
La plupart des gens
n'y ont vu que du feu.
Tout ce que vous avez raconté
sur la guerre, la Corée du Nord...
- Tout est faux ?
- Des rumeurs, et le reste est inventé.
Chacun peut imaginer
ce qui se passe dehors.
Il y a toujours des
lois à Jericho,
et demain nous laisserons les gens
juger ce que vous avez fait.
- On ne peut pas faire ça, Gray.
- Bien sûr que si !
- Les gens doivent savoir qu'on ne
tolère pas ça.  - Pas comme ça.
- Ils ne vont pas s'en sortir
comme ça !  - Si.
On aura évité le pire.
La nourriture ne suffit pas.
Tu l'as dit toi-même...
Sans mesures spéciales,
on ne passera pas l'hiver.
Et bien voilà.
Les gens ont besoin d'espoir
autant que de nourriture.
Et qu'est-ce qu'on
va faire d'eux ?
On leur offre une
sortie victorieuse.
Comment être sûre que tu
ne me suivras pas ?
Je ne te suivrai pas.
Si je prends ton fils
avec moi, c'est sur.
Mon Dieu.
Je le laisserai à la
sortie de la ville.
- Papa !
- Allie, fais-les sortir !
- Ça va ?
- Je vais bien, papa.
- Je suis désolé.
- Papa...
Je vais bien.
Donne-moi ça.
Non, tu ne vas pas bien.
Robert, nous n'allons pas bien !
Combien il leur faudra avant
de venir te chercher ?
Nous chercher ?
- Allons, D., on est en sécurité ici.
- Ne... !
On ne sera jamais
en sécurité avec toi.
Allez.
On y va.
On y va.
Je t'aime, papa.
Je t'aime aussi, mon bébé.
En avant ! Allez !
Notre propre escorte
pour sortir de la ville ?
Écoute, tu es intelligente,
enfuis-toi avant de te faire tuer.
Pour aller où ?
Les villes acceptent les réfugiés,
mais une seule chose
les intéresse chez une femme.
Reste ici. D'accord ?
Tu seras en sécurité.
Ça ne marchera pas.
Pas après ce qu'on s'est dit.
Pas maintenant, Mimi.
Comment ça, Cornhusker ?
Les Cornhusker sont du Nebraska.
Je suis un Jayhawk.
Quoi ?
Tu me rends dingue,
et tu sais que je ne pourrais pas
rester ici pour toujours, mais...
la vérité, c'est que...
je ne peux pas vivre
sans toi, non plus.
Vraiment ?
Oui, vraiment.
<i>"Où en êtes-vous ?"</i>
<i>"Hawkins est mort."</i>
<i>"J'ai le paquet."</i>
<i>"Où peut-on..."</i>
<i>"Où peut-on se rencontrer ?"</i>
<i>"Lieu à définir."
"Je vous contacte"</i>
<i>"Je vous contacte."
"Bon boulot.</i>
Vous avez assez de nourriture
pour tenir quelques jours.
Et pourquoi pas un peu d'eau ?
Débrouillez-vous.
Vous laisserez vos armes
sur le tank,
et vous partez.
Exécution.
Allez.
Allons-y.
Sois prudente.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
On se militarise.
Qu'est-ce qu'on
va faire de ça ?
Y a de la place dans
ta grange ?
Sérieusement ?
Pourquoi pas.
Un tank peut toujours
s'avérer utile.

<i>Précédemment dans </i>Jericho
Certains étaient en avion
et se sont posés au
milieu de nulle part.
Ils ont marché des semaines.
Ils ont dû vivre l'enfer.
Oh mon Dieu... Roger.
Il y a une femme
dans ce groupe de réfugiés
que Bill interroge.
Tu devrais lui parler.
Salut, Rob.
Quelqu'un de mon équipe
nous a vendus.
Tu devrais savoir qu'ils sont prêts à
tout pour te faire parler.
<i>"On se sert de sa famille"</i>
Avec notre consommation actuelle,
nous serons à court de carburant
dans 2 semaines.
On peut vivre sans énergie,
mais on passera pas
l'hiver sans manger.
Bon, plus vous irez loin,
plus les routes seront dangereuses.
La nourriture se faisant rare...
il y aura des risques là-bas.
Mais pourquoi nous suivent-ils ?
Stanley, attention !
Jake !
C'est Maman et Papa, chéri.
Tu vas t'en sortir.
Alors, on m'observe ?
C'est le Vieil Homme.
Il veut nous monter
l'un contre l'autre.
S'ils me tuent, ils ne trouveront
jamais le paquet.
Je possède quelque chose...
que d'autres convoitent.
Et ça nous met, toi, moi et les
enfants... en danger.
Écoute-moi bien...
Sarah n'est pas de notre côté.
Je te préviens, Robert,
elle n'est pas là pour nous aider.
Hawkins commence à rassembler
les pièces du puzzle.
Il doit être éliminé.
- Je sais.
- Alors pourquoi c'est si long ?
Parce qu'il est différent.
Tu n'arriveras pas au Kansas
avec si peu d'essence,
et tu ne trouveras pas
de nourriture là-bas.
Ceux qui sont partis la semaine dernière
sont probablement déjà en Arizona.
S'ils n'ont pas été tués sur la route.
C'est du suicide de partir, Ridley.
On n'a ni nourriture, ni chauffage.
C'est du suicide de rester.
<i>Voilà tout ce qu'on a...</i>
dans chaque ferme.
Jusqu'aux prochaines récoltes,
donc pas avant plusieurs mois.
Et si on ne compte pas les réfugiés ?
Ils habitent ici, maintenant.
Ça fait beaucoup de
bouches à nourrir.
Ils nous ont aidés, Gray.
À la chasse, pour
la coupe du bois...
Ils consomment 5 fois plus vite
qu'ils ne récoltent.
Quand nous aurons les éoliennes,
les problèmes d'essence
seront résolus.
Et jusque-là ?
Ridley et son groupe vont partir.
Si les gens n'en font qu'à leur tête,
c'est leur droit.
Tu sais aussi bien que moi
qu'au printemps,
on retrouvera leurs corps.
Et que veux-tu que je fasse,
Johnston ?
Qu'est-ce que j'ai raté
sur ce tableau ?
Dites-moi, car je ne vois pas.
Sans prendre de
nouvelles mesures,
on ne passera pas l'hiver.
Du moins, pas nous tous.
On doit prendre
des décisions difficiles.
Et je pense que les derniers arrivés
devraient être les premiers à partir.
Dégagez les rues !
Il faut dégager les rues !
Qui est le responsable ici ?
Je suis Gray Anderson,
le Maire de Jericho.
Enchanté, Maire Anderson.
Je suis le Sergent Hill,
4ème division de Marines,
4ème Bataillon de Blindés,
Compagnie Charlie.
Donc vous êtes...
Monsieur,
nous sommes des Marines américains,
et nous venons vous aider.

Ils ont envoyé les Marines ?
Nous nous déployons dans l'ouest du
Kansas pour établir des bases
et préparer l'arrivée du corps
du Génie militaire.
Maintenant que nous avons gagné la
guerre, il est temps de reconstruire.
Quelle guerre ?
- Vous n'êtes pas au courant ?
- Non.
Les communications sont
coupées depuis l'EMP.
Bon, nous avons atomisé la Corée
du Nord ainsi que l'Iran.
Ils étaient derrière tout ça ?
D'après le peu que je sais,
c'est l'Iran qui a financé,
les Nord-Coréens ont
fourni les bombes.
Nous recherchons activement les
terroristes qui ont participé,
mais nous avons retrouvé
les organisateurs.
Que va-t-il se passer
maintenant ?
La plus grosse reconstruction
dans l'histoire du pays.
Donc nous avons un
dirigeant finalement ?
L'ancien secrétaire du HHS
est devenu président.
Nous avons entendu dire qu'il y avait
6 prétendants et autant de capitales.
C'est réglé.
Le gouvernement fédéral s'est
réunifié à Columbus, Ohio.
Comment ont-il choisi
Columbus ?
Je sais seulement que
mes ordres
viennent de l'officier de
commandement du 4ème Bataillon.
Et les ordres sont de rétablir
la lumière...
l'électricité et les infrastructures
du Kansas, une ville après l'autre.
Pour quand est-ce prévu ?
Vous aurez le plein de nourriture et les
pieds au chaud d'ici la fin de l'année.
Bienvenue dans le monde
à nouveau, Jericho.
Merci mon Dieu pour
les Marines US.
C'est fini !
Il y a des enfants ici,
trouvez une chambre !
Allez. On aurait déjà
dû partir hier.
C'est bon, je suis prête.
Salut. Je viens de
faire le plein.
Où en êtes-vous ?
Nous serons prêts
quand il faudra.
Je vais chercher le reste
de mes affaires en bas.
Combien de fois on va encore être
obligé de déménager ?
- Cette fois c'est la bonne.
- Vraiment ?
Tu vas pouvoir rester au même
endroit à partir de maintenant ?
Sergent Green.
Corps des Marines ?
Mon Dieu non.
Les Rangers.
Bon, je vais essayer de ne
pas vous en tenir rigueur.
Alors, Gunny, combien de temps
avant que le Génie soit ici ?
Peut-être deux jours,
ou deux semaines.
Mais avant, dressez la liste
de vos besoins, et je...
la transmettrai au QG du
bataillon à Dodge City,
et nous allons commencer à vous
remettre à flot.  - Bien reçu.
On peut vous être d'une
aide quelconque ?
Un poste de commandement ?
- Prenez le bureau du Sherif.
- Parfait.
Excusez-moi.
Si vous restez dans
le coin un moment,
vos hommes sont les bienvenus
dans ma taverne.
Merci, madame.
Ils en seront ravis.
Wymore !
Avant et centre !
On y va, on y va !
Rassemblement et suivez
cette jeune femme.
Malgré ce parfum de liberté,
souvenez-vous...
comportez-vous en Marines.
- Oui Monsieur.
Ne m'appelez pas "Monsieur",
Première classe.
Je ne suis pas d'active.
Rompez !
A vos ordres,
Sergent Artilleur.
Il y a deux mois, il aurait fait des
pompes jusqu'à dégueuler, mais...
ils en ont bavé.
Je comprends.
Nous pouvons faire autre chose ?
Et bien, Sergent...
il y a bien quelque chose.
Caporal Mullin !
Je recherche des pièces
de rechange.
Notre radio, elle a un peu morflé.
Vous savez ou je
peux demander ?
Je peux peut-être aider.
Caporal Mullin.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
Donc vous êtes leur expert
en électronique ?
Je ne suis pas expert en quoi que
ce soit, mais je sais improviser.
Ça me va.
Allons voir ce qu'on
peut trouver.
<i>"J'ai bientôt le paquet"</i>
<i>"J'ai bientôt le paquet"
"Je vous tient au courant"</i>
Bon...
J'ai bien réfléchi...
Peut être que laisser
ma famille...
n'est pas une si bonne idée.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi ? On en a
déjà parlé. Ils...
ils sont en danger à tes côtés.
Je sais.
Il y a des gens dehors
qui veulent...
les blesser pour m'atteindre.
Mais au moins, je
connais le danger.
Je peux les protéger.
Tu n'es pas logique.
C'est ma famille, Sarah.
Ça n'a jamais été
important pour toi.
Maintenant ça l'est.
Va-t-il falloir que...
quelqu'un égorge ta femme
avant que tu acceptes ?
Tu as raison.
On les laissera à la planque,
et nous continuerons
notre chemin.
C'est ce qui est le
mieux pour eux.
Je viens de réaliser...
Si le gouvernement est
à nouveau en place,
tu sais ce que ça signifie, hein ?
- Non.
Paperasse.
Il vont avoir besoin
de comptables.
C'est le retour de
mes dettes ?
Ne sois pas si négatif.
New York n'a pas été touchée.
Viens l'été prochain,
je t'emmènerai te promener
dans Central Park.
Quoi ?
Hé mec !
C'est trop fort !
Je pourrais devenir un marine.
J'ai hâte de voir ça...
excepté en ce qui
te concerne.
Ne t'inquiète pas pour elle.
C'est juste un passage,
crois-moi.
Dès que tout sera rentré
dans l'ordre,
ce sera aussi bien qu'avant.
Peut-être que tu pourras l'emmener
quand tu repartiras pour New York.
Penser à quitter cette
ville n'est pas
la même chose que
penser te quitter.
Ben, ça revient au même, Mimi.
Peut-être que tu pourrais
venir avec moi.
Ouais, mais je suis désolé.
Ce n'est pas ma vie.
Et ici, ce n'est pas la mienne.
Tu m'as manqué.
Toi aussi.
On devrait y aller.
Commencer à charger le
camion, hein ?
Vas-y, sors d'ici.
On m'a dit ce qui s'était passé.
Tu vas bien ?
Ouais, je vais mieux
que le camion.
Est-ce qu'on va pouvoir arrêter de
s'inquiéter pour toi un de ces jours ?
C'est génial, hein ?
Ouais, de bonnes nouvelles.
Je vous vois plus tard.
A quoi ressemblent les
villes là-dehors ?
Disons que je n'ai rien vu de tel depuis
que nous sommes entrés dans la ZC.
"ZC" ?
Zone de Contamination.
Vous êtes dans la ZC-12,
et il y a bien pire qu'ici.
C'est dur à imaginer.
Faites un tour dans ce qui reste
des quartiers de Lawrence.
A quoi ça ressemble ?
Les immeubles
sont détruits.
Les survivants se battent
avec leurs voisins
pour la nourriture et l'eau.
À se demander si les survivants
sont les plus chanceux.
On a besoin d'un transistor
pour leur radio.
On peut les prendre
dans le jukebox ?
Vous allez me prendre
ma musique ?
Vous ne pouvez pas les
prendre ailleurs ?
Vous avez trois albums des
Spin Doctors là-dedans.
Croyez-moi, ça rendra
service à tout le monde.
Bon, il y a une vieille
radio à la mairie.
Peut-être que ce seront
les bonnes pièces.
- Merci quand même.
- Bye.
Salut, mon grand.
- Merci.
- De rien.
<i>"Avez-vous localisé le paquet ?"
<i>"Avez-vous localisé le paquet ?"
"Pas encore."</i>
<i>"Comment fait-on ?"</i>
<i>"Comment fait-on ?"
"On se sert de sa famille."</i>
Je pense que tu as quelque chose
qui m'appartient.
Chéri,
assieds-toi sur le canapé.
Ton papa et moi devons parler.
Vas-y, Sam.
Fais tes coloriages.
C'est ce que tu veux,
n'est-ce pas ?
Entre autres choses.
Tu m'as menti, Robert.
Quand es-tu retombé
amoureux de ta femme ?
T'inquiète pas.
Continue de colorier.
Allez.
On a instauré le rationnement
il y a quelque temps.
Mais il a fallu du temps
aux gens pour accepter
qu'on était livré à nous-mêmes.
Vous avez fait un meilleur boulot
que la plupart des autres villes.
Cette ville a la chance d'avoir
un militaire pour Maire.
On s'en est bien tiré.
Avec le sel de ma mine,
on a pu faire des échanges
avec les villes voisines.
Votre ville a l'air
de bien s'en sortir.
Ce qui veut dire que...
vous n'allez pas être
prioritaires sur la liste.
Attendez...
Quelle liste ?
Plusieurs détachements essayent de
répondre aux besoins urgents des villes.
Des aides sont apportées
aux plus démunis.
Attendez. Vous dites que...
le fait que l'on ait su s'organiser
va se retourner contre nous ?
On pourrait encore se débrouiller
seuls si on était obligés.
Facile à dire pour toi.
Tu n'es plus le responsable.
Donnez-moi la liste
de vos besoins, et...
je verrai ce que je peux faire.
Essayez celui-là.
Parfait.
Vous ne voulez vraiment pas
me dire ce qui s'est passé ?
Le docteur dit que ce
sont des engelures.
Et elle a aussi dit qui vous
avait botté les fesses ?
Quelqu'un nous a poursuivis.
Le reste est un peu flou.
On a simplement...
essayé de rester en vie,
vous voyez ?
Je vois.
- Alors, les Marines, hein ?
- Ouais.
C'est ce à quoi vous
vous attendiez ?
Ça dépend des moments.
Mais en signant, j'aurais jamais pensé
me battre contre des Américains.
Des gens bien,
forcés à faire des choses mauvaises.
Ça doit être difficile.
Je suis désolé.
C'est pas votre faute.
Quoi ?
C'est juste que...
je me demande pourquoi
quelqu'un comme vous s'est engagé.
Quelqu'un comme moi ?
J'avais un poste de bureau
il y a quelques années,
mais j'en avais marre.
Je voulais découvrir le monde.
- Et alors ?
- J'ai vu Omaha.
- Et vous ?
- Quoi, si j'ai vu le monde ? Ouais.
Mais j'ai seulement vu
les pires endroits.
Et bien...
vous êtes parfait dans ce rôle
d'obscur mauvais garçon.
Sur cette vidéo qu'on m'a envoyée
avant les attaques...
tu n'étais pas réellement
prisonnière.
Tu ne faisais...
Tu t'es foutue de moi ?
Me foutre de toi ?
On vivait ensemble.
Je me pointe ici
et tu as retrouvé ta famille.
C'est bon.
C'est juste une...
une histoire, tu vois ?
On raconte des histoires.
Continue de dessiner.
Tu m'as fait des promesses,
Robert.
C'était qui ces gens
sur la vidéo ?
Ceux pour qui tu bosses ?
Je bossais. Maintenant,
je suis à mon compte.
Pourquoi ne pas me donner
ce que je veux,
que cette histoire
se termine bien.
En fin de compte, les Marines
sont un moyen de...
d'échapper à la routine.
- J'essaie de pas y penser.
Ce qui veut dire
que vous y pensez.
Après tout ce que j'ai vu,
j'aimerais trouver
une petite ville sympa
et m'y installer à long terme.
Je ne pense pas que
ça existe encore.
Je viens d'en découvrir une.
Et vous ?
Vous pensez voler de nouveau ?
Pour l'armée peut-être ?
Bien sûr. C'est plus sûr que
de rester au sol, non ?
Pas en étant opérateur radio.
J'ai la meilleure place.
Je suis toujours dans le tank.
Si c'est vrai, pourquoi
la radio est dans cet état ?
Vous pensez qu'une fille
ne peut pas...
sortir botter quelques fesses
de temps en temps ?
Vous allez essayer d'appeler
qui avec ce truc ?
Le QG de la division
à Dodge City.
C'est à plus de 300 km.
Ce truc peut émettre plus loin.
Du moins, quand il est
en bon état.
4ème Division de Marines,

Authentification "Foudre". Terminé.
<i>Lima Charlie Foudre.
Ici, la Compagnie Charlie.</i>
<i>On essaie de vous joindre
sur cette fréquence depuis des jours.</i>
<i>La Division a besoin du 4ème
bataillon de blindés RTB asap.</i>
<i>Reçu ?</i>
Parfaitement, Monsieur.
<i>Faites au plus vite, Caporal-Chef.</i>
Compris, terminé.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
On a reçu l'ordre de
rentrer à Dodge City.
Que vas-tu faire
de ce paquet, Sarah ?
Le vendre.
Et partir aussi loin
que possible.
Que t'est-il arrivé ?
Ces derniers mois,
j'ai appris deux choses...
que tout le monde a un prix...
et que tout le monde ment.
Reste assis, Sam.
- Prends ton...
- Reste là.
J'étais en pleine conversation
avec votre mari...
sur ce qui est le plus
important pour lui...
son boulot...
ou sa famille.
Pourquoi partez-vous ?
Parce qu'on en a reçu l'ordre.
Désolé mais je ne peux vous
révéler les ordres de mission.
Le Génie arrivera bientôt.
Bientôt ?
Quand ?
Écoutez Monsieur, j'en suis désolé,
mais je ne sais pas.
- Prêts à partir ?
- Paré, Gunny.
Mais pour le tank...
nous manquerons de carburant
pour retourner à Dodge City.
On le laisse ici...
et Sigloch et Kent restent
pour le surveiller.
Sergent, nous serons des proies
faciles pour les pirates.
Nous sommes des Marines.
On s'en sortira.
Je peux vous fournir
du carburant.
Pas beaucoup, mais assez
pour aller à Dodge.
Donnez-moi une heure.
Je vous écoute.
Et... toutes les provisions
dont vous avez besoin.
Mais j'ai besoin d'être assuré que
Jericho ne sera pas oubliée.
Trois C-130 avec des provisions de la
Croix Rouge arriveront dans 12 jours.
Je vous promets que vous serez
les premiers sur leur liste.
C'est tout ce que je demande.
Bon, les gars, écoutez-moi !
On va encore rester ici une heure.
Vous reviendrez avec les
troupes du Génie ?
Non.
Vous devrez vous satisfaire d'un
groupe d'hommes de terrain.
Et les membres du Génie
ne sont pas aussi mignons
que je le suis.
Vous devriez penser à...
revenir quand vous serez
démobilisée.
Qu'est ce que je ferais ici ?
C'est une question que nous
nous posons tous, mais...
vous saurez vous adapter.
Vous voyez,
avant que tout ça n'arrive,
j'aurais été d'accord avec vous.
Mais...
je ne reviendrai pas ici.
Caporal Mullin !
Oui, Sergent Artilleur.
Pourquoi votre équipement
n'est-il pas prêt ?
Ne répondez pas.
Nous sommes postés à la mairie.
Le maire veut nous
exprimer sa gratitude.
Quelqu'un doit rester ici.
Vous...
avez gagné à la courte paille.
À vos ordres, Gunny.
Je vais aller chercher
le reste des provisions
au bureau du shérif.
Va chercher le paquet.
Tu sais que je ne peux pas.
Tu penses que je vais te croire ?
Allez. On peut se sortir de
ce mauvais pas.
Tu as raté ta chance
de me suivre.
- S'il vous plaît !
- Fermez-la !
Vous allez perdre quelque chose
ce soir. Je vous le promets.
La seule question est,
est-ce que ce sera...
un être cher ?
Je vais chercher le paquet.
S'il te plaît, baisse ce flingue.
Vous pourriez descendre
avec Allison aussi ?
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
Ici la compagnie Charlie.</i>
<i>Nous recevez-vous ?</i>
<i>Lima Charlie,
ça caille vraiment ici.</i>
Allô ?
C'est Jake Green.
<i>Jake Green, c'est un canal
officiel des Marines.</i>
<i>Libérez la fréquence...</i>
Allô ?
Allô. Êtes-vous attaqués ?
Hep, Gunny !
C'est un petit quelque chose pour
vous souvenir de nous.
C'est vraiment gentil, M. le Maire,
mais nous devons y aller.
Non, vous ne pouvez pas
partir le ventre vide.
Rentrez, j'ai une petite
surprise pour vous.
Quelque chose pour vous prouver
notre gratitude. Venez.
Va chercher des gars
de la patrouille
et ratissez les environs, d'accord ?
Prenez des armes.
Tu te fiches de moi ?
Nous avons des Marines ici.
Il y quelque chose qui cloche
dans tout ça. Crois-moi.
D'accord...
Je cherche quoi ?
Pour commencer, quelqu'un
avec une radio.
Regardez partout d'où on peut
entendre les feux d'artifice.
Écoute, il n'y a peut-être rien.
Vérifie juste.
- D'accord ? Allez !
- Ok.
J'ai pas le temps.
C'est vraiment super
de vous parler.
Mesdames et messieurs...
Bienvenue, Mesdames et messieurs.
Chers invités...
J'aimerais vraiment que notre
ex-Sergent Green
puisse nous dire quelques mots.
Mesdames et messieurs...
Le corps des Marines
a une devise...
"Semper fidelis"
"Toujours fidèle"
Et ce doit être la providence qui,
dans ces heures sombres,
ce soit des Marines qui
viennent à notre secours.
Jamais auparavant dans
l'histoire de ce pays
une telle devise n'avait été
si appropriée...
et si indispensable.
Gunny, Marines,
Semper Fi.
Alors, Gunny, le Quatrième corps a
eu plus que sa part d'action.
Depuis Iwo jusqu'en Iraq, si il y
a une guerre, il y a le Quatrième.
Semper Fi.
Excusez-nous un instant.
De quoi s'agit-il ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
En bas.
J'ai...
J'ai entendu les feux d'artifice
dans la radio des Marines,
mais Dodge City est à
320 km d'ici.
- Quoi ?  - Ils ont quelqu'un
aux abords de la ville
qui se fait passer pour leur QG.
J'ai envoyé Stanley et deux de
nos gars pour aller vérifier.
Dis-moi que je délire.
Si tu délires,
alors moi aussi.
Personne n'appelle un
Sous-Officier "Monsieur",
et un Marine ne dirait
jamais "Hoo-ah"...
c'est un truc de l'armée.
Ces gars ont fait les deux.
Les Marines sont rigoureux
sur ce genre de détails.
Donc, si ce ne sont pas
des Marines... qui sont-ils ?
Des gars suffisamment armés
pour nous éliminer.
Et on leur a donné la moitié
de nos ressources.
Qu'est ce qu'on fait ?
On doit en parler à Gray.
Comment faire ?
Il est assis à côté d'eux.
Et il faut s'occuper du tank.
Si ce truc se met à tirer
dans la rue...
ca va être un bain de sang.
Même si vous neutralisez le tank, ils
ont toujours une salle remplie d'otages.
Elle a raison.
Retournez là-bas avant qu'ils
se posent des questions.
Essayez de le dire à Gray,
je vais attendre Stanley.
Je vais voir ce que je
peux faire pour le tank.
Comment on peut entendre les feux
d'artifice depuis Dodge City ?
On capte souvent plein
de parasites...
Arrête de me mentir !
<i>Allô ?
Il y a quelqu'un ?</i>
Stanley, c'est bien toi ?
<i>Jake, on a trouvé un
gars avec une radio.</i>
<i>Il dit qu'il est avec les Marines.</i>
<i>Je le ramène.</i>
Tout ça est vraiment réel ?
Le flingue l'est.
Je suis désolée.
Vous avez extorqué assez de nourriture
et de carburant pour aller ailleurs ?
Tu ne sais pas ce qui se
passe dehors.
Si, je sais.
Où vous avez eu
cet équipement ?
Avec le manque de nourriture, il y a
eu une émeute dans notre camp.
Une douzaine de Marines ne font pas le
poids face à 10000 personnes affamées.
Alors, vous les avez tués ?
Ils se sont enfuis et on a pris
ce qu'ils ont laissé.
On a tenté notre chance
dans la ville la plus proche.
Ça a si bien marché
qu'on a continué.
Non.
Vous ne partirez pas
avec votre butin.
Ne tente pas quelque chose
de stupide, Jake.
Je ne veux avoir pas ta mort
sur la conscience.
Je crois pas que tu en aies.
Ouvre-le.
Recule.
Mon Dieu.
- Elle est là depuis le début ?
- Elle n'est pas armée...
et le plomb bloque
les radiations...
- Tu as apporté ça dans notre maison ?
- D...
On avait presque réussi,
et tu lui as dit, Maggie?
Il avait tout découvert.
Il a entendu les feux
dans la radio.
- On fait quoi de lui ?
- C'est à dire ?
On part, tout simplement.
Et après...
on sera à peine à 1 km d'ici quand
tout le monde sera au courant !
Et ça recommencera
comme à Greenville.
On n'est pas des assassins.
J'étais un prof de sport
fana de cinéma.
Maintenant, je suis un Marine.
Je m'adapte.
- Non.
- C'est lui ou nous.
Ce sera vous.
Vous savez, les munitions sont
tellement rares,
ces armes ne sont surement
pas chargées.
Vous prenez le risque ?
Je suis sur que la mienne l'est.
Fils... de pute !
Les mains en l'air !
Levez-les !
Debout !
Comment osez-vous
porter cet uniforme !
Ce n'est pas un uniforme,
c'est un déguisement.
La plupart des gens
n'y ont vu que du feu.
Tout ce que vous avez raconté
sur la guerre, la Corée du Nord...
- Tout est faux ?
- Des rumeurs, et le reste est inventé.
Chacun peut imaginer
ce qui se passe dehors.
Il y a toujours des
lois à Jericho,
et demain nous laisserons les gens
juger ce que vous avez fait.
- On ne peut pas faire ça, Gray.
- Bien sûr que si !
- Les gens doivent savoir qu'on ne
tolère pas ça.  - Pas comme ça.
- Ils ne vont pas s'en sortir
comme ça !  - Si.
On aura évité le pire.
La nourriture ne suffit pas.
Tu l'as dit toi-même...
Sans mesures spéciales,
on ne passera pas l'hiver.
Et bien voilà.
Les gens ont besoin d'espoir
autant que de nourriture.
Et qu'est-ce qu'on
va faire d'eux ?
On leur offre une
sortie victorieuse.
Comment être sûre que tu
ne me suivras pas ?
Je ne te suivrai pas.
Si je prends ton fils
avec moi, c'est sur.
Mon Dieu.
Je le laisserai à la
sortie de la ville.
- Papa !
- Allie, fais-les sortir !
- Ça va ?
- Je vais bien, papa.
- Je suis désolé.
- Papa...
Je vais bien.
Donne-moi ça.
Non, tu ne vas pas bien.
Robert, nous n'allons pas bien !
Combien il leur faudra avant
de venir te chercher ?
Nous chercher ?
- Allons, D., on est en sécurité ici.
- Ne... !
On ne sera jamais
en sécurité avec toi.
Allez.
On y va.
On y va.
Je t'aime, papa.
Je t'aime aussi, mon bébé.
En avant ! Allez !
Notre propre escorte
pour sortir de la ville ?
Écoute, tu es intelligente,
enfuis-toi avant de te faire tuer.
Pour aller où ?
Les villes acceptent les réfugiés,
mais une seule chose
les intéresse chez une femme.
Reste ici. D'accord ?
Tu seras en sécurité.
Ça ne marchera pas.
Pas après ce qu'on s'est dit.
Pas maintenant, Mimi.
Comment ça, Cornhusker ?
Les Cornhusker sont du Nebraska.
Je suis un Jayhawk.
Quoi ?
Tu me rends dingue,
et tu sais que je ne pourrais pas
rester ici pour toujours, mais...
la vérité, c'est que...
je ne peux pas vivre
sans toi, non plus.
Vraiment ?
Oui, vraiment.
<i>"Où en êtes-vous ?"</i>
<i>"Hawkins est mort."</i>
<i>"J'ai le paquet."</i>
<i>"Où peut-on..."</i>
<i>"Où peut-on se rencontrer ?"</i>
<i>"Lieu à définir."
"Je vous contacte"</i>
<i>"Je vous contacte."
"Bon boulot.</i>
Vous avez assez de nourriture
pour tenir quelques jours.
Et pourquoi pas un peu d'eau ?
Débrouillez-vous.
Vous laisserez vos armes
sur le tank,
et vous partez.
Exécution.
Allez.
Allons-y.
Sois prudente.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
On se militarise.
Qu'est-ce qu'on
va faire de ça ?
Y a de la place dans
ta grange ?
Sérieusement ?
Pourquoi pas.
Un tank peut toujours
s'avérer utile.

<i>Previously on Jericho</i>
Some of them were on planes
that landed in
the middle of nowhere.
They've been walking for weeks.
They must have gone
through hell.
Oh, my God.
Roger.
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that
Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team
sold us all out.
You're smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.
At current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.
We can live without
power for now,
but we won't see spring
if we don't eat.
All right, look,
the further out you get,
the hairier the roads are,
and food being
as scarce as it is,
there's bound to be
trouble out there.
Why are they following us?
Stanley, hold on!
Jake!
It's Mom and Dad, honey!
You're going to be all right.
So, I'm being watched?
It's the Old Man.
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.
If they kill me,
they will never find the package.
I have something
in my possession,
and there's people
out there that want it.
And that puts you, me
and the kids in danger here.
Then listen to me...
Sarah is not on our side.
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.
He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
- Why are you stalling on this one?
Because this one is different.
You won't make it out of Kansas
with the fuel you've got,
and you're not going to find
another drop out there.
The folks who left last week
are probably in Arizona by now.
If they weren't
murdered on the highway.
It is suicide to leave, Ridley.
There's no food, no heat.
It's suicide if we stay.
This... this is everything.
I mean, it's every farm.
At least until the spring crops come in,
and that could take months.
And what if we don't
factor in the refugees?
They're a part of this town now.
A lot of extra mouths to feed.
They've done their part, Gray.
They've helped hunt,
cut firewood...
Resources they use up five times
faster than they supply them.
When the windmills come in
from New Bern,
most of our fuel issues
will be solved.
What about every day until then?
Ridley and his group
are about to leave.
If people want to try and make it
on their own, that's their right.
You know as well as I do that
come springtime,
we'll find their bodies out there.
Well, what do you want me to do,
Johnston?
Wh-What am I missing
that's not on that board?
You find it for me,
'cause I don't see it.
Without some "X" factor,
we're not going to make it
through the winter.
Not all of us.
We have to make
some hard decisions.
And I think the last ones in
should be the first ones to go.
Clear the streets!
We need to clear the streets!
Who's in charge here?
I'm Gray Anderson.
I'm the mayor of Jericho.
Glad to meet you,
Mayor Anderson.
I'm Gunnery Sergeant Hill.
Fourth MAR-DIV,
Fourth Tank Battalion,
Charlie Company.
So you're...?
Sir,
we're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.

They sent the marines?
We were deployed to Western Kansas
to set up a firm base
and prep the outlying towns for the
arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Now that we've won the war,
it's time to start rebuilding.
War? What war?
- You didn't hear?
- No.
We lost all communications
after the EMP.
Well, we nuked the hell
out of North Korea and Iran.
So they were behind it?
From what I hear, which isn't much,
Iran financed it,
North Korea supplied the bombs.
We've got troops all over the world
going after the...
terrorists who snuck them in,
but at least we took
out the big dogs.
What happens now?
Largest reconstruction effort
in the history of the country.
So there's somebody
finally in charge?
The former secretary of HHS
is now the president.
We heard there
were six guys
from six different capitals
claiming to be president.
Resolved.
The federal government
is reunifying in Columbus, Ohio.
How did they
decide on Columbus?
All I know is, my orders are coming
from the commanding officer
of the Fourth Battalion,
and
those are to restore lights,
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.
W- Wait, wait.
When is that going to happen?
Should have your shelves full of Oreos
and Hot Pockets by the end of the year.
Welcome back to the grid, Jericho.
Thank God for
the US Marines.
Hey! Hey! It's over.
There are kids out here.
Get a room.
Come on. We should have been
on the road yesterday.
Well, I'm packed.
Hi. We're all fueled up.
How are we doing?
We'll be ready when we're ready.
I'll get the rest of my things
from downstairs.
How many more times
are we going to have to move?
- This should do it.
- Really?
You're going to stay in
one place from now on?
Sergeant Green. Marine Corps?
Ah, hell, no.
Army Rangers.
Well, I'll try not to hold it
against you.
Listen, Gunny, how long
before the engineers get here?
Could be two days,
could be two weeks.
In the meantime, why don't you get
a wish list of what you need,
and I'll forward that on to Battalion
Headquarters in Dodge City,
and we'll start to get y'all back on
your feet.  - Roger that.
Just tell me how
I can be of service.
Going to need
a command post.
- Use the sheriff's office.
- Great.
Excuse me.
If you guys are going
to be here for a while,
why don't I take your men
over to my tavern.
Thanks, ma'am,
my troops could use it.
Wymore!
Front and center!
Move it, move it!
Muster up and follow
this young lady here.
The liberty call is
sounded, but remember...
conduct yourselves like marines.
- Aye Sir.
Don't you "sir" me, PFC.
I work for a living.
Dismissed!
Aye, aye, Gunnery Sergeant.
Couple of months ago, I would have had
that kid doing push-ups till he puked,
but, uh, they've
been through a lot.
I understand.
Anything else we can do?
Well, Sergeant, uh...
one other thing.
Corporal Mullin!
Hi. Uh, I'm looking to scavenge
some replacement parts.
Our radio, well, it took
a couple of pretty good hits.
Do you have any idea
where I could start?
Maybe I could help.
Oh, Lance Corporal Mullin.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
So you're the town's
electronics expert?
No, I'm not an expert
at anything.
- But I can improvise.
- I'll take that.
We'll see what
we can find.
So, uh...
I've been thinking...
Maybe leaving my family...
isn't such a good idea.
What?
Why?
We've been over this.
They-they're not safe
here with you.
I know.
There are people out there
who would...
hurt them in order to get to me.
But at least I understand
the dangers.
I can protect them.
You're not thinking straight.
This is my family, Sarah.
It never mattered before.
Now it does.
What's it going to take...
someone slitting your wife's throat
before you get it ?
You're right.
We will drop them
at the safe house,
and then we'll keep moving.
It's the right thing for them.
I just realized...
Hmm?
If the government
is up and running,
you know what that means, right?
- No
Paperwork.
They'll need
accountants again.
Does that mean I'm back in debt?
Don't be so negative.
New York made it.
Come next summer,
I'll be taking walks
though Central Park.
What?
Dude!
This is awesome!
I could totally
be a marine.
I could totally see that happening...
Except for everything about you.
God, I...
Don't worry about her.
It's a phase, trust me.
The minute everything
calms down,
he's as good as gone.
Yeah, yeah, maybe
you can give him a ride
out of town
on the way to New York.
Thinking about leaving
this town is not
the same thing as thinking
about leaving you.
No?
Well, it adds up to
the same thing, Mimi.
Maybe you could
come with me.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.
That's not my life.
Well, this isn't mine.
I've missed you.
Me, too.
We should get going.
Start loading up
the truck, huh?
Go on, get out of here.
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm better than the truck.
Be able to quit worrying about you
one of these days, right?
Hey, Jake.
Amazing, huh?
Yeah, it's great news.
I'll see you later.
How are most of
the towns out there?
Let's just say
I haven't seen
anything like this
since we entered the CZ.
"CZ"?
Contamination Zone.
You're in CZ-12,
and you're better
off than most.
That's hard to imagine.
Try taking a walk through what's
left of Lawrence, Kansas.
What's it like?
Buildings
are all gone.
People who are left are
fighting their neighbors
for food and water.
Makes you wonder if the
survivors are the lucky ones.
We need a transistor
for their radio.
Can we take
apart the jukebox?
Oh, you're going to take
my music?
Isn't there anything else
you can take apart?
You've got three
Spin Doctors albums on here.
Trust me, it's a public service.
Don't worry, there's an old
ham radio in City Hall.
Maybe we can take that apart.
- Thanks anyway.
- Bye.
Oh, hey, big guy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I think you have something
of mine.
Sweetie,
let's sit down on the couch.
Your dad and I have
some talking to do.
You go ahead, Sam.
Just play with
your coloring books.
This is what you want, right?
Among other things.
You been lying to me, Robert.
When did you fall back
in love with your wife?
It's okay.
You go back to your book.
Go ahead.
We tried to institute
rationing early on,
but it took some time
for people to accept
that we were really
on our own.
Looks like you did a better job
than most towns I've seen.
Town's lucky to have
a military man in charge.
Well, I guess we
made out all right.
With salt from my mine,
we've been able to do
some trading with nearby towns.
Your town seems
to have been blessed.
That said, uh...
I can't say you'll be
a priority on the list.
Um, uh...
Wait a minute... what list?
We got detachments all over Kansas
assessing each town's needs.
Relief is given
on an as needed basis.
Wait a second.
You're saying that because
we planned better than others
it will come against us?
We can make out for
a while longer if we have to.
That's easy for you to say.
You're not being held accountable.
Why don't you give me
that want list and, uh,
I'll see what I can do.
Try that one.
Perfect.
So you're really not going
to tell me what happened?
Doc says frostbite.
Doctor also say
who kicked your ass?
Someone ran us off the road.
Most of it's a blur.
Just, uh,
tried to stay alive, you know?
I do.
- So, the marines, huh?
- Yeah.
Is it everything you hoped for?
There are moments.
But when I signed up, I never
thought I'd be fighting Americans.
Good people forced
to do bad things.
That's got to be rough.
I'm sorry.
It's not your problem.
What?
Just, uh,
wondering why someone like you
would join the marines.
Someone like me?
I had an office job
until a few years ago,
but I got bored.
I wanted to see the world.
- Have you?
- I've seen Omaha.
- You?
- What, seen the world? Yeah.
Yeah, I just saw
all the wrong places.
Man,
you have this brooding,
bad-boy thing down to an art.
The video I was sent
before the attacks,
those people were not
holding you captive.
You were just...
what, you were playing me?
Me playing you?
We were living together.
I showed up here
and you have a family again.
It's okay.
It's just a...
a story, you know?
It's just a story we're telling.
Go back to your book.
You made me promises, Robert.
Who were the people in that video?
Is that who you're working for?
I was. Now,
I'm working for myself.
So why don't you
give me what I want,
and then this story
can have a happy ending.
What are you gonna do
in the Marines finally...
- cut you loose?
- I try not to think about it.
That means you have.
After everything I've seen...
I'd like to find a nice little town
and just settle in
for the duration.
I don't think those
exist anymore.
I just found out they do.
What about you?
You ever thought
about flying again?
Maybe for the military?
Sure. Safer than being
on the ground, right?
Not if you're a radio operator.
I'm the safest of all.
I get to ride in the tank.
But if you ride in the tank,
how'd the radio get shot?
What, you think a girl can't...
get out and kick some ass
every once in a while?
Who you trying to call
on that thing anyway?
Uh, division headquarters
in Dodge City.
That's about 200 miles away.
This thing's made it farther.
Of course, that was
before it took some rounds.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV,
this is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV.
This is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>
<I>We've been trying to raise you
on this frequency for days.
<I>Division needs the entire
fourth tank battalion RTB ASAP.
<I>Do you copy?
Aye, aye, sir.
<I>Make that most tricky-tick, Corporal.
Roger that,
Charlie Company Actual, out.
What's going on?
We just got ordered
back to Dodge City.
What are you going to do
with the package, Sarah?
Sell it.
And get as far away
from here as possible.
What happened to you?
The last few months,
I've learned two things.
Everybody has a price.
And everybody lies.
Sit still, Sam.
- Take your...
- Stay there
I was just having a conversation
with your husband...
about what's more
important to him...
His job...
or his family.
Why are you leaving ?
Because we were
ordered to.
Sorry, but I can't reveal
operational orders.
Army Corps of Engineers
will be through eventually.
Eventually?
How long?
Sir, listen, I'm sorry,
but I just don't know.
You ready to roll?
Good to go, Gunny.
But I don't know
about the tank.
Don't know if we have enough fuel
to make it back to Dodge City.
Leave it behind
if we have to.
We'll post Sigloch and Kent here
till we can make it back.
Sergeant, without armor we're
sitting ducks for those highwaymen.
We're marines. We'll make do.
I can get you fuel.
Not much, but enough
to get you back to Dodge.
Just give me an hour.
I'm listening.
Plus... whatever
supplies you need.
But I just need assurances that
Jericho will be taken care of.
There's three C-130s
full of Red Cross supplies
that are supposed to arrive
in Kansas in 12 days.
I guarantee you'll be
at the top of their list.
That's all I ask.
All right, people,
listen up!
We're going to stand
down for one hour.
When the relief effort comes,
are you guys coming with it?
No.
You're going have to flirt with
a whole new batch of grunts.
And the Corps of Engineers
are nowhere near
as cute as I am.
You should think about...
coming back when you get out.
What would I do here?
That's a question we're all
asking ourselves, but...
you're a good fit.
You know,
before all this started,
I might have agreed with you.
But, uh...
I won't make it back here.
Corporal Mullin!
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant.
Why is your gear
not loaded up?
- Uh...
- Don't answer that.
We're headed over
to the town hall.
The mayor wants
to express his appreciation.
Somebody needs to stay here.
You...
Youjust drew
the short straw.
Aye, Gunny.
I'm going to go get
the last of the supplies
from the sheriff's office.
Get the package.
You know I can't do that.
You think I'm going
to believe a word you say?
Come on. We can work this out.
You had your chance
to go with me.
Please!
Shut up!
You're losing something tonight.
I promise you that.
Only question is,
is it going to be something
with a heartbeat?
I'll get the package.
Please put that gun down.
Why don't you get
Allison down here, too?
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>
Do you copy?
Lima Charlie,
it's cold as hell out here.
Hello?
This is Jake Green.
Jake Green, this is an official
Marine channel.
Get off this...
Hello?
Hello. Are you taking fire?
Hey, Gunny!
It's just a little something
to remember us by.
This is too kind, Mr. Mayor,
but, uh, we really
should press on.
No, you can't take off
on an empty stomach.
Come on in, I got
a little surprise for you.
Just something to show our
gratitude. Come on.
I need you to grab some of
our guys from patrol
and do a sweep of the
area, all right? Take guns.
Are you kidding?
I mean, we got
the US Marines Corps here.
Something's wrong about all this.
Trust me.
Okay, okay. Well...
what am I looking for?
A guy with a radio for starters.
Check anywhere within
earshot of the fireworks.
All right, maybe it's
nothing. Just check.
- All right? Go!
- Okay.
I can't talk.
What?
It's good talking to you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Honored guests.
I was very hopeful
that former Sergeant Green
might like to
say a few words.
Ladies and gentlemen, um...
Marine Corps has a motto
"Semper fidelis"
Always faithful.
And I think it's very fitting
that in our darkest hour,
it was marines who came
to our rescue.
Never before
in our nation's history
has a motto been so tried...
...and so necessary.
Gunny, Marines,
semper fi.
So, Gunny,
the Fighting Fourth.
Seen more than
your share of action.
From Iwo to Iraq, if there's a war,
there's the fourth.
Semper fi.
Excuse us a second.
What is the matter?
What's going on?
Downstairs.
I just, uh...
I heard the fireworks
over the marines' radio,
and Dodge City
is 200 miles away.
- What?  - They've got somebody
on the edge of town
pretending
to be their headquarters.
I sent Stanley and a couple of
the guys to check it out.
Tell me I'm crazy.
If you are, so am I.
Nobody calls an NCO "sir,"
and a marine
would never say, "Hoo-ah."
That's an Army thing.
These guys
did both.
Marines are all
about detail.
Well, if they're not marines,
who are they?
People with enough firepower
to wipe us out.
And we gave them half
the town's supplies.
What do we do?
Well, we've got to tell Gray.
How do we get Gray alone?
He's right next to them.
We got to do something
about that tank.
That thing gets turned lose
on Main Street,
it'll be a
bloodbath.
Even if you get that tank, they'll still
have a room full of hostages.
She's right.
We better get back before
they start to wonder.
Try to get a message to Gray,
and I'll wait for Stanley.
I'll see what I can do
about the tank.
Hey.
How was Dodge City picking up
our fireworks?
We pick up pops and pings
all the time...
Don't lie to me!
<i>Hello? Anyone out there?</i>
Stanley, is that you?
Jake, we found this guy
camping out here
with this radio.
Says he's with the marines.
I'm going to bring him back.
Is any of this real?
The gun's real.
I'm sorry.
You con people out
of stale food
and enough fuel to get
to the next town?
You don't know how bad
it is out there.
Yeah, I do.
Where'd you get all this?
There was a food riot
in our refugee camp.
A dozen marines
never had a chance
against 10,000 starving people.
So you killed them?
They retreated
and we took what they left.
Tried to get some food
in the next town.
It worked so well,
we kept doing it.
Don't.
You're not leaving town
with those supplies.
Don't get yourself killed
doing something stupid, Jake.
I don't want that
on my conscience.
You don't have it in you.
Open it.
Step... back.
My God.
- This has been here the whole time?
- It is not armed,
and the lead blocks
all the radiation...
- You brought that into our house?!
- D...
We were almost out of here,
and you told him, Maggie?
He figured it out.
He heard the fireworks
on the radio.
- So what do we do with him now?
- What do you mean?
Let's just leave.
And what...
wait for him to tell the whole town
when we're half a mile out?
It'll be Greenville
all over again.
We're not killers.
I was a P. E. teacher
who saw too many movies.
Now I'm a marine.
I'm adapting.
- No.
- It's him or us.
I vote for you.
You know, ammunition
being in such short supply,
I doubt those weapons
are even loaded.
You want to take that chance?
I know damn well this one is.
Son of a... bitch!
Get your hands up!
Get them up!
Get up.
How dare you wear
that uniform!
It's not a uniform...
it's a costume.
Half the towns we go through
don't even fly the flag.
Wait. Everything you said
about the war, North Korea,
it was all a lie?
Some of it we heard,
some we made up.
It's anybody's guess what's really
going on out there.
Well, we still have laws
in Jericho,
and tomorrow I'm going to let the town
decide what to do with you.
We can't do that, Gray.
The hell we can't!
People need to know
what we're up against.
Not like this.
Well, they're going to find out
eventually.
Yeah, they will.
And by then, the worst
of it will be over.
But food's not enough.
You said it yourself.
Without some "X" factor,
we don't make it through the winter.
Well, this is it.
People need faith
just as much as they need food.
And what the hell
do we do with them?
Then we give a hero's exit.
Ooh-rah.
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?
I won't follow you.
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.
My God.
I'll leave him
just outside of town.
No!
- Dad!
- Allie, get them out of here!
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.
- I'm sorry.
- Dad...
I'm fine.
Let me take this.
You are not fine.
Robert, we are not fine!
How long till-till
more people come after you?
Huh, after us?
- Come on, D, we're safe here.
- Don't...!
We'll never be safe with you.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, baby girl.
Move out! Let's go!
Our own personal escort
out of town?
Look, you're a smart girl,
you need to get out
before these guys get you killed.
And go where?
Towns aren't taking refugees,
and there's only one thing
they want women for.
Stay here... all right,
you'll be safe.
It's not going to work.
Not after the story we told.
Not now, Mimi.
Like hell not now, Cornhusker.
Cornhuskers are from Nebraska.
I'm a Jayhawk.
What? What?
You drive me so crazy,
and you know that
I can't stay here forever, but...
the truth is...
I can't live without you, either.
Really?
Yes, really.
We got enough food to get all of you
a few days down the road.
Hey, how about some water, man?
Make do.
You'll leave your weapons
on the tank,
and you will move out.
Do it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Be careful.
What do we do?
We soldier on.
What do we do with that?
Got room in your barn?
Seriously?
Why not.
Never know when
you might need a tank.

<i>Prťcťdemment dans </i>Jericho
Quand avais-tu prťvu de
me parler de ce bťbť ?
Un enfant n'a jamais sauvť
un mauvais mariage.
Je ne veux pas que tu restes
avec moi ŗ cause du bťbť, Eric.
Heather !
Mon Dieu.
Jake, je te prťsente Ted Lewis.
On a grandi ensemble
ŗ New Bern.
Voici Russell et Mike.
- Salut
- On se connait.
Avec une douzaine d'ťoliennes,
on peut alimenter la ville entiŤre.
Je vais tout faire pour ramener
la lumiŤre dans nos foyers.
- Tu vas nous quitter ?
- Pas pour longtemps.
Je possŤde quelque chose...
Et Áa nous met, toi, moi et les
enfants... en danger.
Sarah n'est pas de notre cŰtť.
Elle n'est pas lŗ pour nous aider.
Hawkins rassemble
les piŤces du puzzle.
- Il doit Ítre ťliminť.
- Je sais.
Alors pourquoi c'est si long ?
N'essaye pas de me suivre.
Je ne te suivrai pas.
Si je prends ton fils
avec moi, c'est sur.
Chťrie, tu as l'air fatiguť.
As-tu assez dormi ?
Environ sept heures.
- Oý ?
- Dans mon bureau.
«a ne s'appelle pas dormir.
Ton bťbť va avoir un torticolis.
- Vous allez Ítre une redoutable
grand-mŤre.  - Je sais.
- Dr. Green ?
- Oui.
Jessica Williams.
Enchantťe.
M. Ostrowski se plaint
de douleurs ŗ la poitrine.
Il ne veut voir personne
ŗ part vous.
Vous Ítes venu avec
les rťfugiťs, Docteur ?
Presque... ťtudiante en 3Ťme annťe
ŗ l'universitť de Chicago.
Et je prťfŤre "visiteurs"
ŗ "rťfugiťs".
Je suis dťsolťe.
Merci de nous aider.
Ne me remerciez pas.
Je travaille ici pour pouvoir
dormir dans un lit
plutŰt que dans un
sous-sol d'…glise.
Oý dois-je commencer ?
Pneumonie,
malnutrition, hypothermie.
Choisissez un patient,
et regardez ses diagrammes.
- M. Hawkins ?
- Salut, Jim.
Je n'ai pas rťveillť
les enfants ?
Non, c'est bon.
Les miens sont pareils.
Rťveillťs ŗ toute heure.
C'ťtait pire avec la TV.
Je peux faire quelque chose
pour vous, Jim?
Pardon.
Le Maire Anderson veut que je
fasse le point sur les rťfugiťs.
Vous voyez...

sont hťbergťs...

Sarah Mason.
Elle habite chez vous,

Est-ce qu'elle est ici ?
- Le gťnťrateur est rťtabli.
- Merci mon Dieu.
Voilŗ, Áa y est... On utilise

Seul l'hŰpital est encore alimentť.
Notre dernier rťservoir ?
Il va tenir longtemps ?
10, peut-Ítre 12 heures...

Et le biocarburant ?
Nous avons tout utilisť.
Il va falloir attendre des jours.
On doit trouver une

Il fait plus froid que dans
le cul d'une sorciŤre.
Des bougies.
J'ai vu que vous aviez des
lampes allumťes en arrivant.
J'ai un gťnťrateur ŗ
la cave, mais...
je viens de finir l'essence.
Que faisiez-vous ?
Je rangeai quelques
affaires, et...
un peu de nettoyage.
Le reste d'essence pour
du mťnage, hein ?
Darcy vous a bien ťduquť.
…coutez, Jimmy...
J'ťtais sur le point
de finir, alors...
C'est vrai. Pardon.
Bon, comme je le disais,
le Maire m'a demandť de faire le
point sur les rťfugiťs.
La criminalitť est en hausse.
Alors... Sarah Mason ?
Est-elle ici ?
Je peux lui parler ?
Et bien...
Sarah est partie hier.
C'est en rapport avec...
sa famille ŗ la Nouvelle-Orlťans.
Ah bon. Par ce temps ?
Dťsolť du dťrangement.
Non, ce n'est pas grave.
Vous savez, c'est une...
une vilaine coupure
que vous avez lŗ.
Ah oui, c'ťtait...
une branche d'arbre en
coupant du bois.
- «a a dŻ beaucoup saigner.
- Non, ce n'est pas profond.
Bon, faites attention.
C'est dangereux lŗ dehors.
Encore dťsolť pour
le dťrangement.
Je ne me sens pas bien.
Je me suis sentie ťpuisťe
soudainement.
Je sais.
Je t'avais dit que tu
devais te reposer.
Maintenant, tu vas
pouvoir le faire.
Je ne vais pas laisser quoi que
ce soit t'arriver ma chťrie.
J'insiste pour qu'elle se repose,
mais je crains qu'il n'y ait un
problŤme avec le bťbť.
Et elle doit le sentir aussi.
- Qu'allons-nous faire ?
- Aller chercher Kenchy ?
Il y a un autre docteur en ville ?
Il tient ŗ peine assis sur
son tabouret de bar.
J'aurai vraiment besoin
d'une machine ŗ ultrasons.
Sans Áa, on ne peut faire
aucun diagnostic.
Il y en a peut-Ítre un ŗ la cave
qui aurait rťsistť ŗ l'E.M.P.
- Je vais voir.
- Bien.
Va chercher ton pŤre
et dis-lui de trouver Eric.
C'est lui qui devrait Ítre ici.
Ce sont les gars de New Bern.
Ils ont rťussi ŗ la construire.
Je n'en crois pas mes yeux.
Salut, Russell.
Salut. «a fait plaisir
de vous revoir.
Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les ťlections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
Ils en avaient marre
que tu sois shťrif ?
Je suis toujours shťrif.
J'ai juste plus d'autoritť.
Voici notre nouveau Maire.
Gray Anderson.
- M. Anderson.
- Enchantť.
Fťlicitations.
Merci. Alors, c'est cette
fameuse ťolienne ?
C'est Áŗ, un gťnťrateur ŗ turbine.
On sort environ 1500 Watts/heure
avec un de ces trucs.
- As-tu vu Eric ?
- Non, tu es allť chez Mary ?
Ouais. J'ai essayť lŗ-bas.
J'ai essayť au Bailey's.
Ce truc fonctionne ?
On peut avoir du courant avec ?
Probablement dŤs demain.
Montons-la aussi vite que possible.
L'hŰpital va en avoir besoin.
- OK.
Il y a un problŤme avec April.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Elle s'est ťvanouie. Ils pensent
qu'il y a un problŤme avec le bťbť.
Je passerai te chercher 5h00.
Je rentrerai ŗ pied.
Stanley pense que tu
utilises ce volontariat
comme un prťtexte pour
voir Sean Henthorn.
Il m'a demandť de garder
un oeil sur toi.
Personnellement, je m'en fiche de
savoir avec qui tu sors.
Je fais du volontariat
depuis que j'ai 16 ans.
Rien ŗ voir avec Sean.
As-tu dťjŗ fait du volontariat ?
Au moins une fois ?
M. Fredrickson.
Attendez-moi.
Gracie vous donnait les graines de
betterave contre 3% de votre rťcolte.
Ces 3% sont ŗ moi maintenant.
Le magasin m'est revenu.
Je ne peux plus le faire, Dale.
Les choses ont empirť.
J'en ai besoin pour ma famille,
pour remplir mes rťserves.
Je suis dťsolť.
C'est la loi, M. Fredrickson.
«a me revient de droit.
Il n'y a plus de lois, fiston.
Je suis volontaire.
Alors. Que dois-je faire ?
Tu les vides, tu les nettoies...
et tu recommences.
Mais oý est Eric ?
Personne ne sait. Papa a demandť
ŗ Bill de le chercher.
Sa pression artťrielle chute.
- Je sens les contractions.
- Elle commence le travail.
Non, non, ce n'est pas possible.
Le bťbť n'a que 16 semaines.
Il faut de la ritodrine
pour arrÍter le travail.
J'ai vťrifiť, il n'y en en a plus. Je
vais voir s'il reste de la nifedipine.
Comment te sens-tu ?
Si je perds conscience, et que vous
ne trouvez pas de mťdicaments,
utilisez de l'alcool.
Que veux-tu dire ?
Quel genre d'alcool ?
N'importe, pourvu qu'il sorte
d'un alambic.
Mettez-moi une perf ŗ 10%.
«a arrÍtera les contractions.
Mon Dieu, elle saigne.
Va chercher Kenchy.
Tout de suite !
J'ai tellement froid que ma
bouche est engourdie.
On va ramasser ces bŻches sinon
on va mourir de froid.
C'est pas dťjŗ le cas ?
C'est vrai.
Retournons dans le camion.
Couverture.
Mets le chauffage.
Non, dťsolť.
On aura plus assez d'essence
pour rentrer.
Tu sais, on peut se rťchauffer.
Ne te fais pas d'idťes...
je ne vais pas me dťshabiller.
Tu sais ŗ quel point
tu me rends heureux.
Je ne me dťshabillerai toujours pas.
Venez !
Pression artťrielle ?
- Vous sentez la vinasse.
- Enchantť ťgalement.
- Pression artťrielle, s'il vous plaÓt ?
- 80/44 en diminution.
- Elle est dilatťe ?
- 2 centimŤtres.
Contractions espacťes
de six minutes.
Il faut des ultrasons.
On est parti en chercher ŗ la cave.
Je vais voir oý ils en sont.
- On a du plasma ?
- Non.
Il faut trouver quelqu'un...
- Du groupe O-Nťgatif.
- Oui.
Et il faut un moniteur cardiaque
pour le foetus.
On peut avoir Áa ?
Non ?
Alors, prenez Áa et surveillez les
battements de son coeur.
Mettez Áa dans vos oreilles,
je vais vous expliquer.
Je suis sourde.
Madame ?
Prenez Áa, et surveillez
les battements de son coeur.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Si. Je vais vous expliquer.
Allez, venez !
S'il vous plaÓt !
TrŤs bien. Mettez-le.
Et ťcoutez.
Bon, le plus aigu,
le plus rapide.
Vous l'entendez ?
C'est le battement du bťbť.
Vous comptez pendant
15 secondes,
et vous multipliez par quatre.
- Pour avoir les pulsations par minutes.
- Parfait.
Je vais vous montrer pour
la pression artťrielle,
et les pulsations cardiaques.
TrŤs bien, tenez-vous
prÍt ŗ le lever.
Tu veux que je rŤgle un
litige sur un contrat ?
M. Fredrickson ne donne pas ŗ
Dale ce qu'il lui doit.
Tu te moques de moi, non ?
J'essaye de rťtablir l'ťlectricitť.
Il y a des vols partout en ville.
Les rťfugiťs menacent de forcer
la rťserve de nourriture.
OK, on le lŤve ŗ trois.
Un...
Deux...
Trois.
Allons-y.
Encore plus haut, plus haut.
OK, doucement.
C'est bon.
Attention ŗ la corde.
C'est bon.
Continuez.
On y est presque.
C'est bon de votre cŰtť ?
Tendez le c‚ble.
Bon boulot les gars.
Comment va le bťbť ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est bientŰt prÍt ?
Quelques heures encore.
Tu as trouvť Eric ?
Non. Bill et les rangers
sont en train de le chercher.
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
Oui. Discutons-en.
<i>M. Hawkins !</i>
<i>C'est encore moi !</i>
<i>M. Hawkins, vous Ítes lŗ ?</i>
Une seconde !
Vous ne rťpondiez pas ŗ la porte,
alors...
Vous faites du jardinage ?
Un coup de main ?
Non. Non, merci.
J'allais m'occuper du terreau.
Le prťparer pour les plantations
au printemps.
C'est une bonne idťe.
Margaret plante ses carottes
ŗ l'intťrieur.
Ce sont de bons lťgumes,
vous savez...
comme les brocolis.
Vous vouliez quelque chose,
Jimmy ?
Gray voulait savoir ce que Sarah
avait pu emporter avec elle.
Vous voyez.... essence, nourriture.
Est-ce qu'elle...
est partie en voiture ?
- Pas en voiture.
Elle avait un sac ŗ dos.
Un peu de nourriture...
une tente.
Elle est partie ŗ pied
par ce froid, hein ?
C'est dingue.
Peut-Ítre que Darcy
en sait plus.
Non, je ne pense pas.
Je pensais que...
les femmes se parlent, et
personne ne sait de quoi, hein ?
Est-ce que Darcy est lŗ ?
Je peux... lui parler ?
Nous avons des problŤmes.
Elle est partie.
Merde... sale coup.
Beaucoup de personnes vous
ont quittť rťcemment, non ?
Je suis dťsolť.
C'ťtait dťplacť. Je...
Je vais prendre une veste.
Je vais vous emmener
la voir, Jimmy.
Vraiment ?
<i>Vous n'Ítes pas vraiment douť
pour la communication, hein ?</i>
Parce que, c'est ce qui fait
la rťussite d'un mariage.
<i>La confiance... l'amour.</i>
<i>C'est 50-50.</i>
<i>Moitiť-moitiť, vous voyez ?</i>
Ou plutŰt un tiers, si on
rajoute le respect.
<i>Mais pas des tiers ťquivalents,
parce que la confiance...</i>
<i>est plus importante que
l'amour et le respect.</i>
<i>A mon avis.</i>
Vous possťdez les seules mines
de sel ŗ 650km ŗ la ronde.
Encore une annťe sans sel,
et New Bern sera une ville fantŰme.
Il vous faudrait quoi, 100 kg ?
Non, bien plus que Áa.
- Il nous faut de la nourriture.
- On n'en a pas de trop.
La prochaine rťcolte
sera au printemps.
C'est bien de Áa que je parle.
10 ťoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la rťcolte.
Non, on ne peut pas
accepter Áa.
La rťcolte suffit ŗ peine
pour passer l'annťe.
Avec 10% en moins, on sera dans la
mÍme situation qu'aujourd'hui.
Ou pire.
…coutez, on vous demande
juste d'Ítre raisonnable.
On essaye simplement de survivre.
Crevez de faim l'automne prochain,
ou mourrez de froid cet hiver...
ŗ vous de choisir.
Vancomycin, c'est parfait.
Mettez en place une perfusion
intraveineuse ŗ 250 milligrammes.
Je vais le faire.
On a trouvť 4 donneurs O-.
- Rythme cardiaque ŗ 169.
- J'enlŤve les ultrasons.
Pression artťrielle 130/70.
Respiration ŗ 18,
Pouls ŗ 88, en augmentation.
Elle perd du sang.
Son coeur bat plus vite
pour compenser.
Mettez-la sous perfusion
sanguine.
Vous voyez quoi ?
- Placenta praevia.
- C'est quoi Áa ?
C'est quand le placenta obstrue
entiŤrement l'utťrus.
Je ne peux pas savoir d'oý vient
l'hťmorragie sans opťrer.
Bon, que fait-on ?
MÍme en situation normale,
ce n'est pas une salle d'opťration.
- Mais on n'a pas le choix.
- On ne peut pas opťrer ici.
Pourquoi ?
Je me suis dťjŗ trop souvent
retrouvť dans cette situation.
Nous avons tous eu des
moments difficiles...
J'ai vu des centaines de
personnes mourir
ŗ cause d'installations insalubres,
d'infection, ou parce que je n'avais
pas de mťdicaments,
ou d'ťquipements appropriťs.
Je ne recommencerai pas.
On ne peut pas perdre ce bťbť.
Alors, trouvez quelqu'un d'autre
pour la charcuter.
Il doit y avoir un moyen.
- Kenchy !
- …coute...
il faut une salle stťrile,
des instruments stťriles,
du matťriel pour une anesthťsie
et une cťsarienne.
Avez-vous dťjŗ vu des opťrations
pratiquťes sans mÍme d'ťlectrocautŤre ?
Non, bien sŻr, ce n'est
mÍme plus enseignť.
On ne peut pas utiliser des ťponges pour
laparotomie pour arrÍter l'hťmorragie ?
J'ai un de ces mal au cr‚ne.
On a plusieurs kits pour
blocage spinal,
et un ťquipement d'anesthťsie.
Et on peut mettre les instruments
dans de l'eau bouillante.
C'est possible ?
- On peut tenter.
- Alors, vas-y.
- Il faut de l'eau de javel.
- Quoi ?
Eau de Javel.
Tu comprends ?
Bonnie, regarde mes lŤvres.
Javel !
Apprends.
- «a veut dire "Javel" ?
- Non.
[ jeux de mot ]
[ bleach = javel / bitch = salope ]
Et... "S'il te plaÓt."
Et "Pardon."
Je vais faire un tour.
Si je ne reviens pas avant
la nuit, enferme-toi...
et ne laisse rentrer personne.
Et si je ne reviens jamais,
va voir Gail Green et Johnston si tu
as besoin de quelque chose.
Tu peux leur faire confiance.
Je vais venir avec toi.
Pourquoi ?
On sera 2 contre 1.
Salut, Bill.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
C'ťtait spontanť.
C'ťtait...
Comme Áa, sur le moment.
Tu ťtais volontaire
bien avant que j'arrive ici.
C'est bon.
C'est juste que Kenchy
ne te connait pas.
Tous les autres te respectent.
Ils parlent ton langage.
- On a un problŤme.
- Lequel ?
Eddie et Frank se demandent pourquoi
vous n'acceptez pas leur offre.
La nouvelle va se rťpandre.
Ils croient toujours que le Gťnie
militaire sera lŗ d'ici un mois.
«a ne choquera personne si on
partage la rťcolte avec New Bern.
Ils pensent avoir de la
nourriture d'ici lŗ.
T'as pas voulu leur dire la vťritť,
alors on fait quoi ?
On devrait informer les gens
qu'aucune aide ne viendra.
On leur demande simplement de
leur donner de quoi passer l'hiver.
La situation est dťjŗ tendue,
ce serait l'anarchie.
Et on ne va pas entamer les rťserves
de l'hiver, Áa serait du suicide.
Et si on donnait ŗ New Bern
10% de la prochaine rťcolte.
On pourra rťtablir l'ťlectricitť.
Si on a rien ŗ donner l'an prochain,
on la gardera quand mÍme.
C'est comme Áa que les
guerres commencent.
J'arrive pas ŗ croire que Darcy
soit dans ce camp de rťfugiťs.
Laisse-moi lui parler un instant.
- Bien sŻr.
- Merci.
Je t'ai demandť de
rester loin de nous.
Jimmy voulait te poser
quelques questions...
ŗ propos de Sarah.
Oý sont les enfants ?
En train de jouer dans
le gymnase.
Notre histoire doit tenir debout.
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait du corps ?
Je l'ai enterrť.
Je pourrais tout leur dire,
et je ne te reverrai plus.
Je pourrais lui dire...
- Comment t'appelles Áa, "le paquet" ?
- ArrÍte !
T'as compris l'histoire ?
La famille ?
La Nouvelle-Orlťans ?
Et tu ne sais rien
d'autre ŗ son sujet.
«a ne prendra pas longtemps.
Je ne veux pas vous
parler en sa prťsence.
Vous pouvez nous laisser
une minute, M. Hawkins ?
J'attends devant...
Je vous laisse discuter.
«a va aller, mon ange.
Vous avez dťjŗ opťrť ŗ plusieurs ?
Seulement ŗ l'ťcole.
J'ai plutŰt exercť
en post-opťratoire.
Je suis obligťe de vous demander
si vous vous sentez assez sobre.
Il est encore temps.
Appelez-moi Dr. Dhuwalia,
infirmiŤre.
Et ma sobriťtť n'est
pas en question.
Ceux que j'appelle "Docteur"
n'empestent pas l'alcool.
Respiration 16.
Rythme cardiaque 82.
La tension est descendue ŗ 100/62.
Que Dieu nous aide.
- Le bťbť va bien ?
- J'en sais rien.
Maman a dit qu'il
y avait un problŤme.
On rťcoltait du bois
pour faire un feu.
Pas la peine de te justifier.
Et auprŤs de maman ?
T'en fais pas.
Fermez la porte.
On perd trop de sang.
Clampez-moi Áa.
…loignez-vous de l'incision !
Je vťrifie que le bťbť
ne souffre pas.
…loignez-vous de l'incision.
Vous m'empÍchez de lui prendre
le pouls depuis une heure.
Respiration 16.
Rythme cardiaque 84.
Un pouls infťrieur ŗ 5
pulsations/minute est mortel.
Vous Ítes trop loin du foetus
pour que la mesure soit fiable.
Le placenta est coincť dans
l'utťrus, il se dťchire.
- «a explique l'hťmorragie.
- Je l'ai perdu.
- J'entends plus rien.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Le coeur du bťbť s'est arrÍtť.
- Comment Áa, arrÍtť ?
- Faites quelque chose.
Le gťnťrateur a dŻ s'arrÍter.
Ouvrez la porte.... Relevez les stores.
Il me faut de la lumiŤre.
Pourquoi ne faites-vous
rien pour le bťbť ?
Ce n'est plus le bťbť
qui nous prťoccupe.
Il n'a jamais vraiment eu
sa chance.
- Dťsolťe.
- Qu'est-ce que vous dites ?
J'essaie de sauver April.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- La mÍme chose qu'avant.
- Ma part de la rťcolte.
- C'est impossible. Rentre chez toi.
Je demande simplement
ce qui me revient.
Vous disiez qu'il n'y a
plus de loi, hein ?
J'essaie pas de t'arnaquer.
Il ne me reste pas
grand-chose.
Alors, donnez-moi ma part
sur ce qu'il reste.
Tout de suite.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Je...
J'ai besoin d'air.
On a perdu le bťbť.
Chťri...
Je dois retourner auprŤs d'April.
Pourquoi avez-vous ťtť si long ?
AprŤs avoir...
parlť avec Darcy...
beaucoup d'ťlťments
ont enfin pris un sens.
«a va, M. Hawkins ?
Je vais bien.
Darcy a dit...
que Sarah ťtait en Nouvelle-Orlťans,
comme vous avez dit.
Quoi ? Vous pensiez
que je mentais ?
J'ai proposť ŗ Darcy et aux enfants
de venir chez nous.
Pas la peine qu'elle
reste dans cet abri.
Merci, Jimmy.
J'apprťcie.
On a dťcouvert un corps, Robert.
Dans les bois.
PrŤs de Mill Creek.
Le cou cassť.
Un truc horrible.
Michael Connor patrouillait,
il a vu une Afro-Amťricaine
conduisant dans les environs
il y a quelques nuits de Áa.
La description parfaite
de Sarah Mason.
Vraiment ?
Vous pensez qu'elle
en serait capable ?
Je ne sais pas.
Vous savez,
je me rends compte que...
il est difficile de savoir de quoi
les gens sont capables, Jimmy.
Notre inconnu ťtait chauve.
Vous le connaissez pas ?
Si Sarah revient...
on souhaiterait vraiment
lui parler.
ņ mon avis,
elle ne reviendra pas.
C'est aussi mon avis.
New Bern a une terre argileuse,
rien ne poussera.
Il nous faut 10% de votre rťcolte,
et 300 kg de sel.
Vous aviez dit 200.
- Les prix augmentent.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que c'est le prix de
l'ťnergie dans ce monde.
Voyons...
Il y a des gens qui meurent de froid
dans leur maison. L‚chez du mou.
T'ťtais au mariage de mon fils.
Vos problŤmes me dťsolent.
Mais on a les nŰtres.
On vous donnera
la nourriture, le sel.
Tout.
On peut vous apporter les
ťoliennes dans 2 semaines.
Quelle garantie on a
pour la rťcolte ?
T'as notre parole.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
On peut les emmener avec nous.
C'est vraiment pour
vous filer un coup de main ?
Ou c'est plutŰt pour vous assurer
que vous aurez nos rťcoltes ?
Des Ítres humains comme garantie ?
Je ne ferais jamais Áa.
Mais je vais pas construire
ces trucs ŗ crťdit.
Vous les voulez ?
Va falloir nous aider.
Continuez ŗ appuyer.
Appuyez ici. Ici !
Appuyez, plus fort !
Bordel ! J'y vois rien !
Je vais chercher une autre lampe.
Tu peux en apporter 10, Áa ne
changera rien. C'est insuffisant.
Il me faut de la vraie lumiŤre !
La pression artťrielle
est descendue ŗ 66/30.
C'est fou.
C'est fou.
Refermez-la.
On n'a pas arrÍtť l'hťmorragie.
- Que faites-vous ?
- Laissez-la en paix.
Rendez-lui sa dignitť.
Vous ne l'abandonnerez pas.
Dťsolť.
Refermez-la.
Oý croyez-vous aller ?
Retournez-y, tout de suite !
- Allez !
- Calme-toi.
Calme-toi, OK ?
Laisse-moi faire.
Laisse-moi m'en charger.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Tu veux que je le dise
en face de lui ?
Rentre, OK ?
April a besoin de toi.
Continuer l'opťration
est cruel et ne mŤnera ŗ rien.
Ne me le demande pas, Jake.
C'est fini pour moi.
Je suis devenu plasticien pour avoir une
vie simple et aisťe comme les autres.
- C'est pas possible ici.
- Je m'en fous.
J'y retournerai pas.
C'est de la folie.
Alors, tu oublies tous
les autres ici ?
Si tu abandonnes, et puis moi,
et qu'ils voient Áa...
ce sera la fin de tout.
On dťpend tous les uns des autres,
que Áa te plaise ou non.
Rassure-moi, tu n'es pas en train
de dire qu'on est tous liťs ?
Que ce n'est pas une connerie de
cercle existentiel...
hein, c'est pas Áa, Jake ?
Alors, dis-moi ce que
tu veux entendre.
Je te dirai ce que tu veux,
si tu retournes lŗ-bas
et continues d'essayer.
Elle va mourir.
Je sais.
Bon. Des gants neufs.
On va dťjŗ arrÍter cette hťmorragie.
- Nous avons d'autres ťponges.
- Excellent !
Pressez-les sur les
autres saignements.
Laissez-moi le temps
de recoudre.
Il va avoir besoin de toi.
Maintenant.
Prends ma main.
Je suis lŗ.
Juste ŗ cŰtť de toi.
J'aime bien Tracy comme prťnom.
Tracy...
c'est un trŤs joli nom.
Merci de n'avoir rien dit.
Je ne l'ai pas fait pour toi,
mais pour Allison.
J'aimerai qu'on soit ŗ
nouveau une famille.
J'ai...
J'ai besoin de toi.
Tu vois, durant les...
trois derniers mois, je me suis
souvenue des raisons...
pour lesquelles j'ai besoin de toi
dans ma vie.  - Moi aussi.
Mais je sais aussi pourquoi
Áa ne marchera jamais.
J'ai besoin d'honnÍtetť.
Et tu n'en as jamais fait preuve.
Tout ce que j'ai fait,
je l'ai fait...
…coute...
Quand tu dissimules une
partie de toi-mÍme,
et peut importe pourquoi,
cela met une barriŤre entre nous.
S'il te plaÓt.
Ma fille vient de tuer une femme.
Je ne peux plus te faire confiance.
J'emmŤne les enfants et
Margaret ŗ la maison.
Je peux vous aider ?
Prenez Áa.
Attendez lŗ.
J'ai foi en vous les gars.
Pardon ?
L'ťolienne fonctionne.
Mlle Hodges,
comment allez-vous ?
- Pas trŤs bien.
- Faisons un nouveau bilan.
Dr. Dhuwalia.
La toux de Mlle Hodges empire.
Elle a de la fiŤvre.
Bonjour, Mlle Hodges.
Je suis le Dr. Dhuwalia.
- Enchantť.
- Enchantť.
Pourriez-vous aller chercher
une casserole d'eau bouillante,
et faire un cŰne en papier. Cette femme
doit respirer un air trŤs humide.
Respirez profondťment.
Voilŗ.
C'ťtait incroyable !
T'as vu la tÍte qu'il a faite ?
J'ai bien cru qu'il allait
faire une attaque.
On aurait dŻ l'emmener
jusqu'ŗ l'hŰpital.
Je pense que Áa va aller.
Merci d'Ítre venue.
Je voulais Ítre ici...
avec toi.
<i>Vous Ítes les seuls, les gars, ŗ savoir
ce qui se passe rťellement lŗ dehors.</i>
Vous Ítes les seuls, les gars, ŗ savoir
ce qui se passe rťellement lŗ dehors.
Quand New Bern aura reÁu sa part
de la rťcolte de printemps...
vous pourrez revenir.
Je sais que Áa peut sembler long...
mais ce que vous allez faire...
est vital pour cette ville.
Maintenant vous...
Vous voulez surement un moment pour
dire au revoir ŗ vos familles. Allez-y.
Promets-moi quelque chose...
Promets-moi de ne pas tuer
Mimi pendant mon absence.
Et que tu lui donneras ŗ manger.
Pourquoi dois-tu partir ?
Des gens vont mourir si nous n'allons
pas chercher ces ťoliennes...
Tu es tout ce que j'ai.
Je reviendrai.
Prends soin de Bonnie, OK?
…coute, je veux juste
te dire un truc.
- Ne panique pas, OK ?
- D'accord.
Dans ce...
monde de fous, on ne sait pas de
quoi demain sera fait et...
je ne veux pas laisser
de non-dits, donc...
Je vais juste le dire, d'accord ?
Je me lance...
Je t'ai aimť dŤs le premier jour oý
je t'ai vu au Bailey's.
Tu l'as dit...
Tu l'as dit en premier.
Personne ne me l'a jamais dit en
premier auparavant.
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il peut se
passer demain, et...
en plus...
je pourrais te le dire jusqu'ŗ
la fin de nos jours.
Je t'aime, Stanley Richmond.
Mais je l'ai dit avant.
Ce n'ťtait pas ta faute, Eric.
Tu n'es pas obligť de faire Áa.
Je ne peux pas rester ici.
Je ne peux pas.
Fais attention, fiston.
Soit fort.
Je suis dťsolť, Maman.
On prendra soin de Mary.
Allez, allons-y.
Mon pŤre m'a tout expliquť.
D'abord vous nous aidez, puis Áa...
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je vais veiller sur eux.
Tu peux me faire confiance.
Confiance ?
Je ne suis pas comme Áa.
Oý est Heather ?
Elle va bien. Je lui ai dit que
nous venions...
mais elle n'a pas voulu venir.
C'est la vťritť.
Si quoi que ce soit leur arrive...
c'est toi que je viendrai
voir en premier.
Je sais.

<i>Prťcťdemment dans </i>Jericho
Quand avais-tu prťvu de
me parler de ce bťbť ?
Un enfant n'a jamais sauvť
un mauvais mariage.
Je ne veux pas que tu restes
avec moi ŗ cause du bťbť, Eric.
Heather !
Mon Dieu.
Jake, je te prťsente Ted Lewis.
On a grandi ensemble
ŗ New Bern.
Voici Russell et Mike.
- Salut
- On se connait.
Avec une douzaine d'ťoliennes,
on peut alimenter la ville entiŤre.
Je vais tout faire pour ramener
la lumiŤre dans nos foyers.
- Tu vas nous quitter ?
- Pas pour longtemps.
Je possŤde quelque chose...
Et Áa nous met, toi, moi et les
enfants... en danger.
Sarah n'est pas de notre cŰtť.
Elle n'est pas lŗ pour nous aider.
Hawkins rassemble
les piŤces du puzzle.
- Il doit Ítre ťliminť.
- Je sais.
Alors pourquoi c'est si long ?
N'essaye pas de me suivre.
Je ne te suivrai pas.
Si je prends ton fils
avec moi, c'est sur.
Chťrie, tu as l'air fatiguť.
As-tu assez dormi ?
Environ sept heures.
- Oý ?
- Dans mon bureau.
«a ne s'appelle pas dormir.
Ton bťbť va avoir un torticolis.
- Vous allez Ítre une redoutable
grand-mŤre.  - Je sais.
- Dr. Green ?
- Oui.
Jessica Williams.
Enchantťe.
M. Ostrowski se plaint
de douleurs ŗ la poitrine.
Il ne veut voir personne
ŗ part vous.
Vous Ítes venu avec
les rťfugiťs, Docteur ?
Presque... ťtudiante en 3Ťme annťe
ŗ l'universitť de Chicago.
Et je prťfŤre "visiteurs"
ŗ "rťfugiťs".
Je suis dťsolťe.
Merci de nous aider.
Ne me remerciez pas.
Je travaille ici pour pouvoir
dormir dans un lit
plutŰt que dans un
sous-sol d'…glise.
Oý dois-je commencer ?
Pneumonie,
malnutrition, hypothermie.
Choisissez un patient,
et regardez ses diagrammes.
- M. Hawkins ?
- Salut, Jim.
Je n'ai pas rťveillť
les enfants ?
Non, c'est bon.
Les miens sont pareils.
Rťveillťs ŗ toute heure.
C'ťtait pire avec la TV.
Je peux faire quelque chose
pour vous, Jim?
Pardon.
Le Maire Anderson veut que je
fasse le point sur les rťfugiťs.
Vous voyez...
trouver chez qui ils
sont hťbergťs...

pour aider la ville.
Sarah Mason.
Elle habite chez vous,

M. Hawkins ?
«a caille lŗ dehors.
Est-ce qu'elle est ici ?
- Le gťnťrateur est rťtabli.
- Merci mon Dieu.
Voilŗ, Áa y est... On utilise

Seul l'hŰpital est encore alimentť.
Notre dernier rťservoir ?
Il va tenir longtemps ?
10, peut-Ítre 12 heures...
alors, ťteignez tout
ce qui ne sert pas.
Et le biocarburant ?
Nous avons tout utilisť.
Il va falloir attendre des jours.
On doit trouver une

Il fait plus froid que dans
le cul d'une sorciŤre.
Des bougies.
J'ai vu que vous aviez des
lampes allumťes en arrivant.
J'ai un gťnťrateur ŗ
la cave, mais...
je viens de finir l'essence.
Que faisiez-vous ?
Je rangeai quelques
affaires, et...
un peu de nettoyage.
Le reste d'essence pour
du mťnage, hein ?
Darcy vous a bien ťduquť.
…coutez, Jimmy...
J'ťtais sur le point
de finir, alors...
C'est vrai. Pardon.
Bon, comme je le disais,
le Maire m'a demandť de faire le
point sur les rťfugiťs.
La criminalitť est en hausse.
Alors... Sarah Mason ?
Est-elle ici ?
Je peux lui parler ?
Et bien...
Sarah est partie hier.
C'est en rapport avec...
sa famille ŗ la Nouvelle-Orlťans.
Ah bon. Par ce temps ?
Dťsolť du dťrangement.
Non, ce n'est pas grave.
Vous savez, c'est une...
une vilaine coupure
que vous avez lŗ.
Ah oui, c'ťtait...
une branche d'arbre en
coupant du bois.
- «a a dŻ beaucoup saigner.
- Non, ce n'est pas profond.
Bon, faites attention.
C'est dangereux lŗ dehors.
Encore dťsolť pour
le dťrangement.
Je ne me sens pas bien.
Je me suis sentie ťpuisťe
soudainement.
Je sais.
Je t'avais dit que tu
devais te reposer.
Maintenant, tu vas
pouvoir le faire.
Je ne vais pas laisser quoi que
ce soit t'arriver ma chťrie.
J'insiste pour qu'elle se repose,
mais je crains qu'il n'y ait un
problŤme avec le bťbť.
Et elle doit le sentir aussi.
- Qu'allons-nous faire ?
- Aller chercher Kenchy ?
Il y a un autre docteur en ville ?
Il tient ŗ peine assis sur
son tabouret de bar.
J'aurai vraiment besoin
d'une machine ŗ ultrasons.
Sans Áa, on ne peut faire
aucun diagnostic.
Il y en a peut-Ítre un ŗ la cave
qui aurait rťsistť ŗ l'E.M.P.
- Je vais voir.
- Bien.
Va chercher ton pŤre
et dis-lui de trouver Eric.
C'est lui qui devrait Ítre ici.
Ce sont les gars de New Bern.
Ils ont rťussi ŗ la construire.
Je n'en crois pas mes yeux.
Salut, Russell.
Salut. «a fait plaisir
de vous revoir.
Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les ťlections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
Ils en avaient marre
que tu sois shťrif ?
Je suis toujours shťrif.
J'ai juste plus d'autoritť.
Voici notre nouveau Maire.
Gray Anderson.
- M. Anderson.
- Enchantť.
Fťlicitations.
Merci. Alors, c'est cette
fameuse ťolienne ?
C'est Áŗ, un gťnťrateur ŗ turbine.
On sort environ 1500 Watts/heure
avec un de ces trucs.
- As-tu vu Eric ?
- Non, tu es allť chez Mary ?
Ouais. J'ai essayť lŗ-bas.
J'ai essayť au Bailey's.
Ce truc fonctionne ?
On peut avoir du courant avec ?
Probablement dŤs demain.
Montons-la aussi vite que possible.
L'hŰpital va en avoir besoin.
- OK.
Il y a un problŤme avec April.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Elle s'est ťvanouie. Ils pensent
qu'il y a un problŤme avec le bťbť.
Je passerai te chercher 5h00.
Je rentrerai ŗ pied.
Stanley pense que tu
utilises ce volontariat
comme un prťtexte pour
voir Sean Henthorn.
Il m'a demandť de garder
un oeil sur toi.
Personnellement, je m'en fiche de
savoir avec qui tu sors.
Je fais du volontariat
depuis que j'ai 16 ans.
Rien ŗ voir avec Sean.
As-tu dťjŗ fait du volontariat ?
Au moins une fois ?
M. Fredrickson.
Attendez-moi.
Gracie vous donnait les graines de
betterave contre 3% de votre rťcolte.
Ces 3% sont ŗ moi maintenant.
Le magasin m'est revenu.
Je ne peux plus le faire, Dale.
Les choses ont empirť.
J'en ai besoin pour ma famille,
pour remplir mes rťserves.
Je suis dťsolť.
C'est la loi, M. Fredrickson.
«a me revient de droit.
Il n'y a plus de lois, fiston.
Je suis volontaire.
Alors. Que dois-je faire ?
Tu les vides, tu les nettoies...
et tu recommences.
Mais oý est Eric ?
Personne ne sait. Papa a demandť
ŗ Bill de le chercher.
Sa pression artťrielle chute.
- Je sens les contractions.
- Elle commence le travail.
Non, non, ce n'est pas possible.
Le bťbť n'a que 16 semaines.
Il faut de la ritodrine
pour arrÍter le travail.
J'ai vťrifiť, il n'y en en a plus. Je
vais voir s'il reste de la nifedipine.
Comment te sens-tu ?
Si je perds conscience, et que vous
ne trouvez pas de mťdicaments,
utilisez de l'alcool.
Que veux-tu dire ?
Quel genre d'alcool ?
N'importe, pourvu qu'il sorte
d'un alambic.
Mettez-moi une perf ŗ 10%.
«a arrÍtera les contractions.
Mon Dieu, elle saigne.
Va chercher Kenchy.
Tout de suite !
J'ai tellement froid que ma
bouche est engourdie.
On va ramasser ces bŻches sinon
on va mourir de froid.
C'est pas dťjŗ le cas ?
C'est vrai.
Retournons dans le camion.
Couverture.
Mets le chauffage.
Non, dťsolť.
On aura plus assez d'essence
pour rentrer.
Tu sais, on peut se rťchauffer.
Ne te fais pas d'idťes...
je ne vais pas me dťshabiller.
Tu sais ŗ quel point
tu me rends heureux.
Je ne me dťshabillerai toujours pas.
Venez !
Pression artťrielle ?
- Vous sentez la vinasse.
- Enchantť ťgalement.
- Pression artťrielle, s'il vous plaÓt ?
- 80/44 en diminution.
- Elle est dilatťe ?
- 2 centimŤtres.
Contractions espacťes
de six minutes.
Il faut des ultrasons.
On est parti en chercher ŗ la cave.
Je vais voir oý ils en sont.
- On a du plasma ?
- Non.
Il faut trouver quelqu'un...
- Du groupe O-Nťgatif.
- Oui.
Et il faut un moniteur cardiaque
pour le foetus.
On peut avoir Áa ?
Non ?
Alors, prenez Áa et surveillez les
battements de son coeur.
Mettez Áa dans vos oreilles,
je vais vous expliquer.
Je suis sourde.
Madame ?
Prenez Áa, et surveillez
les battements de son coeur.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Si. Je vais vous expliquer.
Allez, venez !
S'il vous plaÓt !
TrŤs bien. Mettez-le.
Et ťcoutez.
Bon, le plus aigu,
le plus rapide.
Vous l'entendez ?
C'est le battement du bťbť.
Vous comptez pendant
15 secondes,
et vous multipliez par quatre.
- Pour avoir les pulsations par minutes.
- Parfait.
Je vais vous montrer pour
la pression artťrielle,
et les pulsations cardiaques.
TrŤs bien, tenez-vous
prÍt ŗ le lever.
Tu veux que je rŤgle un
litige sur un contrat ?
M. Fredrickson ne donne pas ŗ
Dale ce qu'il lui doit.
Tu te moques de moi, non ?
J'essaye de rťtablir l'ťlectricitť.
Il y a des vols partout en ville.
Les rťfugiťs menacent de forcer
la rťserve de nourriture.
OK, on le lŤve ŗ trois.
Un...
Deux...
Trois.
Allons-y.
Encore plus haut, plus haut.
OK, doucement.
C'est bon.
Attention ŗ la corde.
C'est bon.
Continuez.
On y est presque.
C'est bon de votre cŰtť ?
Tendez le c‚ble.
Bon boulot les gars.
Comment va le bťbť ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est bientŰt prÍt ?
Quelques heures encore.
Tu as trouvť Eric ?
Non. Bill et les rangers
sont en train de le chercher.
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
Oui. Discutons-en.
<i>M. Hawkins !</i>
<i>C'est encore moi !</i>
<i>M. Hawkins, vous Ítes lŗ ?</i>
Une seconde !
Vous ne rťpondiez pas ŗ la porte,
alors...
Vous faites du jardinage ?
Un coup de main ?
Non. Non, merci.
J'allais m'occuper du terreau.
Le prťparer pour les plantations
au printemps.
C'est une bonne idťe.
Margaret plante ses carottes
ŗ l'intťrieur.
Ce sont de bons lťgumes,
vous savez...
comme les brocolis.
Vous vouliez quelque chose,
Jimmy ?
Gray voulait savoir ce que Sarah
avait pu emporter avec elle.
Vous voyez.... essence, nourriture.
Est-ce qu'elle...
est partie en voiture ?
- Pas en voiture.
Elle avait un sac ŗ dos.
Un peu de nourriture...
une tente.
Elle est partie ŗ pied
par ce froid, hein ?
C'est dingue.
Peut-Ítre que Darcy
en sait plus.
Non, je ne pense pas.
Je pensais que...
les femmes se parlent, et
personne ne sait de quoi, hein ?
Est-ce que Darcy est lŗ ?
Je peux... lui parler ?
Nous avons des problŤmes.
Elle est partie.
Merde... sale coup.
Beaucoup de personnes vous
ont quittť rťcemment, non ?
Je suis dťsolť.
C'ťtait dťplacť. Je...
Je vais prendre une veste.
Je vais vous emmener
la voir, Jimmy.
Vraiment ?
<i>Vous n'Ítes pas vraiment douť
pour la communication, hein ?</i>
Parce que, c'est ce qui fait
la rťussite d'un mariage.
<i>La confiance... l'amour.</i>
<i>C'est 50-50.</i>
<i>Moitiť-moitiť, vous voyez ?</i>
Ou plutŰt un tiers, si on
rajoute le respect.
<i>Mais pas des tiers ťquivalents,
parce que la confiance...</i>
<i>est plus importante que
l'amour et le respect.</i>
<i>A mon avis.</i>
Vous possťdez les seules mines
de sel ŗ 650km ŗ la ronde.
Encore une annťe sans sel,
et New Bern sera une ville fantŰme.
Il vous faudrait quoi, 100 kg ?
Non, bien plus que Áa.
- Il nous faut de la nourriture.
- On n'en a pas de trop.
La prochaine rťcolte
sera au printemps.
C'est bien de Áa que je parle.
10 ťoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la rťcolte.
Non, on ne peut pas
accepter Áa.
La rťcolte suffit ŗ peine
pour passer l'annťe.
Avec 10% en moins, on sera dans la
mÍme situation qu'aujourd'hui.
Ou pire.
…coutez, on vous demande
juste d'Ítre raisonnable.
On essaye simplement de survivre.
Crevez de faim l'automne prochain,
ou mourrez de froid cet hiver...
ŗ vous de choisir.
Vancomycin, c'est parfait.
Mettez en place une perfusion
intraveineuse ŗ 250 milligrammes.
Je vais le faire.
On a trouvť 4 donneurs O-.
- Rythme cardiaque ŗ 169.
- J'enlŤve les ultrasons.
Pression artťrielle 130/70.
Respiration ŗ 18,
Pouls ŗ 88, en augmentation.
Elle perd du sang.
Son coeur bat plus vite
pour compenser.
Mettez-la sous perfusion
sanguine.
Vous voyez quoi ?
- Placenta praevia.
- C'est quoi Áa ?
C'est quand le placenta obstrue
entiŤrement l'utťrus.
Je ne peux pas savoir d'oý vient
l'hťmorragie sans opťrer.
Bon, que fait-on ?
MÍme en situation normale,
ce n'est pas une salle d'opťration.
- Mais on n'a pas le choix.
- On ne peut pas opťrer ici.
Pourquoi ?
Je me suis dťjŗ trop souvent
retrouvť dans cette situation.
Nous avons tous eu des
moments difficiles...
J'ai vu des centaines de
personnes mourir
ŗ cause d'installations insalubres,
d'infection, ou parce que je n'avais
pas de mťdicaments,
ou d'ťquipements appropriťs.
Je ne recommencerai pas.
On ne peut pas perdre ce bťbť.
Alors, trouvez quelqu'un d'autre
pour la charcuter.
Il doit y avoir un moyen.
- Kenchy !
- …coute...
il faut une salle stťrile,
des instruments stťriles,
du matťriel pour une anesthťsie
et une cťsarienne.
Avez-vous dťjŗ vu des opťrations
pratiquťes sans mÍme d'ťlectrocautŤre ?
Non, bien sŻr, ce n'est
mÍme plus enseignť.
On ne peut pas utiliser des ťponges pour
laparotomie pour arrÍter l'hťmorragie ?
J'ai un de ces mal au cr‚ne.
On a plusieurs kits pour
blocage spinal,
et un ťquipement d'anesthťsie.
Et on peut mettre les instruments
dans de l'eau bouillante.
C'est possible ?
- On peut tenter.
- Alors, vas-y.
- Il faut de l'eau de javel.
- Quoi ?
Eau de Javel.
Tu comprends ?
Bonnie, regarde mes lŤvres.
Javel !
Apprends.
- «a veut dire "Javel" ?
- Non.
[ jeux de mot ]
[ bleach = javel / bitch = salope ]
Et... "S'il te plaÓt."
Et "Pardon."
Je vais faire un tour.
Si je ne reviens pas avant
la nuit, enferme-toi...
et ne laisse rentrer personne.
Et si je ne reviens jamais,
va voir Gail Green et Johnston si tu
as besoin de quelque chose.
Tu peux leur faire confiance.
Je vais venir avec toi.
Pourquoi ?
On sera 2 contre 1.
Salut, Bill.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
C'ťtait spontanť.
C'ťtait...
Comme Áa, sur le moment.
Tu ťtais volontaire
bien avant que j'arrive ici.
C'est bon.
C'est juste que Kenchy
ne te connait pas.
Tous les autres te respectent.
Ils parlent ton langage.
- On a un problŤme.
- Lequel ?
Eddie et Frank se demandent pourquoi
vous n'acceptez pas leur offre.
La nouvelle va se rťpandre.
Ils croient toujours que le Gťnie
militaire sera lŗ d'ici un mois.
«a ne choquera personne si on
partage la rťcolte avec New Bern.
Ils pensent avoir de la
nourriture d'ici lŗ.
T'as pas voulu leur dire la vťritť,
alors on fait quoi ?
On devrait informer les gens
qu'aucune aide ne viendra.
On leur demande simplement de
leur donner de quoi passer l'hiver.
La situation est dťjŗ tendue,
ce serait l'anarchie.
Et on ne va pas entamer les rťserves
de l'hiver, Áa serait du suicide.
Et si on donnait ŗ New Bern
10% de la prochaine rťcolte.
On pourra rťtablir l'ťlectricitť.
Si on a rien ŗ donner l'an prochain,
on la gardera quand mÍme.
C'est comme Áa que les
guerres commencent.
J'arrive pas ŗ croire que Darcy
soit dans ce camp de rťfugiťs.
Laisse-moi lui parler un instant.
- Bien sŻr.
- Merci.
Je t'ai demandť de
rester loin de nous.
Jimmy voulait te poser
quelques questions...
ŗ propos de Sarah.
Oý sont les enfants ?
En train de jouer dans
le gymnase.
Notre histoire doit tenir debout.
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait du corps ?
Je l'ai enterrť.
Je pourrais tout leur dire,
et je ne te reverrai plus.
Je pourrais lui dire...
- Comment t'appelles Áa, "le paquet" ?
- ArrÍte !
T'as compris l'histoire ?
La famille ?
La Nouvelle-Orlťans ?
Et tu ne sais rien
d'autre ŗ son sujet.
«a ne prendra pas longtemps.
Je ne veux pas vous
parler en sa prťsence.
Vous pouvez nous laisser
une minute, M. Hawkins ?
J'attends devant...
Je vous laisse discuter.
«a va aller, mon ange.
Vous avez dťjŗ opťrť ŗ plusieurs ?
Seulement ŗ l'ťcole.
J'ai plutŰt exercť
en post-opťratoire.
Je suis obligťe de vous demander
si vous vous sentez assez sobre.
Il est encore temps.
Appelez-moi Dr. Dhuwalia,
infirmiŤre.
Et ma sobriťtť n'est
pas en question.
Ceux que j'appelle "Docteur"
n'empestent pas l'alcool.
Respiration 16.
Rythme cardiaque 82.
La tension est descendue ŗ 100/62.
Que Dieu nous aide.
- Le bťbť va bien ?
- J'en sais rien.
Maman a dit qu'il
y avait un problŤme.
On rťcoltait du bois
pour faire un feu.
Pas la peine de te justifier.
Et auprŤs de maman ?
T'en fais pas.
Fermez la porte.
On perd trop de sang.
Clampez-moi Áa.
…loignez-vous de l'incision !
Je vťrifie que le bťbť
ne souffre pas.
…loignez-vous de l'incision.
Vous m'empÍchez de lui prendre
le pouls depuis une heure.
Respiration 16.
Rythme cardiaque 84.
Un pouls infťrieur ŗ 5
pulsations/minute est mortel.
Vous Ítes trop loin du foetus
pour que la mesure soit fiable.
Le placenta est coincť dans
l'utťrus, il se dťchire.
- «a explique l'hťmorragie.
- Je l'ai perdu.
- J'entends plus rien.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Le coeur du bťbť s'est arrÍtť.
- Comment Áa, arrÍtť ?
- Faites quelque chose.
Le gťnťrateur a dŻ s'arrÍter.
Ouvrez la porte.... Relevez les stores.
Il me faut de la lumiŤre.
Pourquoi ne faites-vous
rien pour le bťbť ?
Ce n'est plus le bťbť
qui nous prťoccupe.
Il n'a jamais vraiment eu
sa chance.
- Dťsolťe.
- Qu'est-ce que vous dites ?
J'essaie de sauver April.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- La mÍme chose qu'avant.
- Ma part de la rťcolte.
- C'est impossible. Rentre chez toi.
Je demande simplement
ce qui me revient.
Vous disiez qu'il n'y a
plus de loi, hein ?
J'essaie pas de t'arnaquer.
Il ne me reste pas
grand-chose.
Alors, donnez-moi ma part
sur ce qu'il reste.
Tout de suite.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Je...
J'ai besoin d'air.
On a perdu le bťbť.
Chťri...
Je dois retourner auprŤs d'April.
Pourquoi avez-vous ťtť si long ?
AprŤs avoir...
parlť avec Darcy...
beaucoup d'ťlťments
ont enfin pris un sens.
«a va, M. Hawkins ?
Je vais bien.
Darcy a dit...
que Sarah ťtait en Nouvelle-Orlťans,
comme vous avez dit.
Quoi ? Vous pensiez
que je mentais ?
J'ai proposť ŗ Darcy et aux enfants
de venir chez nous.
Pas la peine qu'elle
reste dans cet abri.
Merci, Jimmy.
J'apprťcie.
On a dťcouvert un corps, Robert.
Dans les bois.
PrŤs de Mill Creek.
Le cou cassť.
Un truc horrible.
Michael Connor patrouillait,
il a vu une Afro-Amťricaine
conduisant dans les environs
il y a quelques nuits de Áa.
La description parfaite
de Sarah Mason.
Vraiment ?
Vous pensez qu'elle
en serait capable ?
Je ne sais pas.
Vous savez,
je me rends compte que...
il est difficile de savoir de quoi
les gens sont capables, Jimmy.
Notre inconnu ťtait chauve.
Vous le connaissez pas ?
Si Sarah revient...
on souhaiterait vraiment
lui parler.
ņ mon avis,
elle ne reviendra pas.
C'est aussi mon avis.
New Bern a une terre argileuse,
rien ne poussera.
Il nous faut 10% de votre rťcolte,
et 300 kg de sel.
Vous aviez dit 200.
- Les prix augmentent.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que c'est le prix de
l'ťnergie dans ce monde.
Voyons...
Il y a des gens qui meurent de froid
dans leur maison. L‚chez du mou.
T'ťtais au mariage de mon fils.
Vos problŤmes me dťsolent.
Mais on a les nŰtres.
On vous donnera
la nourriture, le sel.
Tout.
On peut vous apporter les
ťoliennes dans 2 semaines.
Quelle garantie on a
pour la rťcolte ?
T'as notre parole.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
On peut les emmener avec nous.
C'est vraiment pour
vous filer un coup de main ?
Ou c'est plutŰt pour vous assurer
que vous aurez nos rťcoltes ?
Des Ítres humains comme garantie ?
Je ne ferais jamais Áa.
Mais je vais pas construire
ces trucs ŗ crťdit.
Vous les voulez ?
Va falloir nous aider.
Continuez ŗ appuyer.
Appuyez ici. Ici !
Appuyez, plus fort !
Bordel ! J'y vois rien !
Je vais chercher une autre lampe.
Tu peux en apporter 10, Áa ne
changera rien. C'est insuffisant.
Il me faut de la vraie lumiŤre !
La pression artťrielle
est descendue ŗ 66/30.
C'est fou.
C'est fou.
Refermez-la.
On n'a pas arrÍtť l'hťmorragie.
- Que faites-vous ?
- Laissez-la en paix.
Rendez-lui sa dignitť.
Vous ne l'abandonnerez pas.
Dťsolť.
Refermez-la.
Oý croyez-vous aller ?
Retournez-y, tout de suite !
- Allez !
- Calme-toi.
Calme-toi, OK ?
Laisse-moi faire.
Laisse-moi m'en charger.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Tu veux que je le dise
en face de lui ?
Rentre, OK ?
April a besoin de toi.
Continuer l'opťration
est cruel et ne mŤnera ŗ rien.
Ne me le demande pas, Jake.
C'est fini pour moi.
Je suis devenu plasticien pour avoir une
vie simple et aisťe comme les autres.
- C'est pas possible ici.
- Je m'en fous.
J'y retournerai pas.
C'est de la folie.
Alors, tu oublies tous
les autres ici ?
Si tu abandonnes, et puis moi,
et qu'ils voient Áa...
ce sera la fin de tout.
On dťpend tous les uns des autres,
que Áa te plaise ou non.
Rassure-moi, tu n'es pas en train
de dire qu'on est tous liťs ?
Que ce n'est pas une connerie de
cercle existentiel...
hein, c'est pas Áa, Jake ?
Alors, dis-moi ce que
tu veux entendre.
Je te dirai ce que tu veux,
si tu retournes lŗ-bas
et continues d'essayer.
Elle va mourir.
Je sais.
Bon. Des gants neufs.
On va dťjŗ arrÍter cette hťmorragie.
- Nous avons d'autres ťponges.
- Excellent !
Pressez-les sur les
autres saignements.
Laissez-moi le temps
de recoudre.
Il va avoir besoin de toi.
Maintenant.
Prends ma main.
Je suis lŗ.
Juste ŗ cŰtť de toi.
J'aime bien Tracy comme prťnom.
Tracy...
c'est un trŤs joli nom.
Merci de n'avoir rien dit.
Je ne l'ai pas fait pour toi,
mais pour Allison.
J'aimerai qu'on soit ŗ
nouveau une famille.
J'ai...
J'ai besoin de toi.
Tu vois, durant les...
trois derniers mois, je me suis
souvenue des raisons...
pour lesquelles j'ai besoin de toi
dans ma vie.  - Moi aussi.
Mais je sais aussi pourquoi
Áa ne marchera jamais.
J'ai besoin d'honnÍtetť.
Et tu n'en as jamais fait preuve.
Tout ce que j'ai fait,
je l'ai fait...
…coute...
Quand tu dissimules une
partie de toi-mÍme,
et peut importe pourquoi,
cela met une barriŤre entre nous.
S'il te plaÓt.
Ma fille vient de tuer une femme.
Je ne peux plus te faire confiance.
J'emmŤne les enfants et
Margaret ŗ la maison.
Je peux vous aider ?
Prenez Áa.
Attendez lŗ.
J'ai foi en vous les gars.
Pardon ?
L'ťolienne fonctionne.
Mlle Hodges,
comment allez-vous ?
- Pas trŤs bien.
- Faisons un nouveau bilan.
Dr. Dhuwalia.
La toux de Mlle Hodges empire.
Elle a de la fiŤvre.
Bonjour, Mlle Hodges.
Je suis le Dr. Dhuwalia.
- Enchantť.
- Enchantť.
Pourriez-vous aller chercher
une casserole d'eau bouillante,
et faire un cŰne en papier. Cette femme
doit respirer un air trŤs humide.
Respirez profondťment.
Voilŗ.
C'ťtait incroyable !
T'as vu la tÍte qu'il a faite ?
J'ai bien cru qu'il allait
faire une attaque.
On aurait dŻ l'emmener
jusqu'ŗ l'hŰpital.
Je pense que Áa va aller.
Merci d'Ítre venue.
Je voulais Ítre ici...
avec toi.
<i>Vous Ítes les seuls, les gars, ŗ savoir
ce qui se passe rťellement lŗ dehors.</i>
Vous Ítes les seuls, les gars, ŗ savoir
ce qui se passe rťellement lŗ dehors.
Quand New Bern aura reÁu sa part
de la rťcolte de printemps...
vous pourrez revenir.
Je sais que Áa peut sembler long...
mais ce que vous allez faire...
est vital pour cette ville.
Maintenant vous...
Vous voulez surement un moment pour
dire au revoir ŗ vos familles. Allez-y.
Promets-moi quelque chose...
Promets-moi de ne pas tuer
Mimi pendant mon absence.
Et que tu lui donneras ŗ manger.
Pourquoi dois-tu partir ?
Des gens vont mourir si nous n'allons
pas chercher ces ťoliennes...
Tu es tout ce que j'ai.
Je reviendrai.
Prends soin de Bonnie, OK?
…coute, je veux juste
te dire un truc.
- Ne panique pas, OK ?
- D'accord.
Dans ce...
monde de fous, on ne sait pas de
quoi demain sera fait et...
je ne veux pas laisser
de non-dits, donc...
Je vais juste le dire, d'accord ?
Je me lance...
Je t'ai aimť dŤs le premier jour oý
je t'ai vu au Bailey's.
Tu l'as dit...
Tu l'as dit en premier.
Personne ne me l'a jamais dit en
premier auparavant.
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il peut se
passer demain, et...
en plus...
je pourrais te le dire jusqu'ŗ
la fin de nos jours.
Je t'aime, Stanley Richmond.
Mais je l'ai dit avant.
Ce n'ťtait pas ta faute, Eric.
Tu n'es pas obligť de faire Áa.
Je ne peux pas rester ici.
Je ne peux pas.
Fais attention, fiston.
Soit fort.
Je suis dťsolť, Maman.
On prendra soin de Mary.
Allez, allons-y.
Mon pŤre m'a tout expliquť.
D'abord vous nous aidez, puis Áa...
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je vais veiller sur eux.
Tu peux me faire confiance.
Confiance ?
Je ne suis pas comme Áa.
Oý est Heather ?
Elle va bien. Je lui ai dit que
nous venions...
mais elle n'a pas voulu venir.
C'est la vťritť.
Si quoi que ce soit leur arrive...
c'est toi que je viendrai
voir en premier.
Je sais.

<i>Previously on </i>Jericho
When were you planning
on telling me about the baby?
A bad marriage doesn't get better
because you add a kid.
I didn't want you to stay with me
because of the baby, Eric.
Heather!
My God.
Uh... Jake, this is Ted Lewis.
We grew up together
over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.
I'm going to help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.
- Just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.
I have something
in my possession
and it puts you, me and the kids
in danger here.
Sarah is not on our side.
She's not here to help us.
Hawkins is starting
to put the pieces together.
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.
Why are you stalling on this one?
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?
I won't follow you.
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.
Honey, you look tired.
You getting enough sleep?
Almost seven hours.
- Where?
- In my office.
Sleeping in your office
doesn't count.
You're going to give
the baby a crick in its neck.
You're going to make
a terrific grandmother.
- I know.
- You're Dr. Green? - Yes.
Jessica Williams.
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Ostrowski says
he's having chest pains.
He doesn't want anybody
to look at him but you.
Are you the doctor
who came in with the refugees?
Close. Third-year med student,
University of Chicago.
And I prefer
"visitor" to "refugee."
I'm sorry.
Thanks for the help.
Don't thank me.
I'm just working here
'cause I get to sleep in a bed
instead of the church basement.
Where do I start?
Pneumonia,
malnutrition, hypothermia.
Just grab a chart
and pick a patient.
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Hey, Jim.
Hope I didn't wake the kids.
No, you're okay.
Mine are the same way.
Up at all hours.
Worse when we had TV.
Is there something
I can do for you, Jim?
Sorry. Um...
Mayor Anderson wants me
to keep track of the refugees.
You know,
find out where they end up.
See what kind of work
they're doing to help the town.
Sarah Mason.
She's been...
staying with you, right?
Mr. Hawkins...
It's freezing out here. Uh...
Is she around?
- Oh, the generator's back on.
- Thank God.
Well, that's it.
We're on our last tank of diesel.
Power's out to everything
but the medical center.
Our last tank?
How long will we have power?
Ten, maybe 12 hours,
so turn off anything
you're not using.
What about the biodiesel?
We burned through it.
We're not going
to have any more for days.
We need to come up
with another plan.
We're getting more and
more people in here every...
Oh, God!
April, can you hear me?
Is she breathing?
April, wake up!
Get over here!

It's colder than a witch's patootie.
Using candles.
I saw you had some electric lights on
when I was walking up.
I got a geni
in the basement, but, uh...
I just used the last of my gas.
What were you doing?
I'm putting some stuff
in storage, but, uh...
I was just cleaning up.
Using the last of your fuel
on housework, huh?
Darcy's trained you well.
Listen, Jimmy, um...
I was just about to turn in, so...
Right. Sorry.
Uh, well, like I said,
Mayor Anderson's got me keeping
tabs on the refugees, you know.
Crime's up.
So, Sarah Mason.
Is she here?
Can I ask her some questions?
You know, um...
Sarah left yesterday.
Something about, uh...
family in New Orleans.
Wow. In this weather?
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.
Hey, don't worry about it.
You know, that's a...
nasty- looking cut
you got there.
Uh, yeah, it was, uh...
tree branch when
I was cutting wood.
- Must have been a real bleeder.
- Hey, it's not too deep.
Well, you be careful.
It's dangerous out there.
Again, sorry to bother you.
Yes.
I don't feel good.
I'm so tired all of a sudden.
I know.
I told you you need
to get some rest.
Here's your big chance.
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you, honey.
I'm trying to keep her calm,
but my gut tells me
the baby's having a problem,
and if I know it, she knows it.
- What are we going to do?
- Get Kenchy?
There's another doctor in town?
The man can barely
sit up on his bar stool.
Look, what I really need is
an ultrasound machine.
Without it, there's no real way
to know what's going on.
Well, maybe we have one that
survived the EMP in the basement.
- I'll go look.
- Good.
You go get your father
and tell him to find Eric.
He's the one who should be here.
It's the guys from New Bern.
They actually built the thing.
I can't believe it.
Hey, Russell.
- Hey. Sheriff, good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Johnston, you SOB.
- How the hell did you lose an election?
- No, the question is,
how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Well, this is our new mayor.
This is Gray Anderson.
- Mayor Anderson.
- Nice to meet you.
Congratulations.
Thank you. Thank you.
So, this is the windmill, huh?
It's a power-generating wind turbine.
We get about 1,500 watts an hour
out of one of these.
- Have you seen Eric?
- No, did you try Mary's?
Yeah. I tried there.
I tried at Bailey's.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably some time tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
I think we're going to need it
at the medical center.
- You got it.
- There's something wrong with April.
What? What is it?
She passed out. They think
there's a problem with the baby.
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
I'll walk.
Stanley thinks that you're using
this whole volunteering thing
as an excuse
to see Sean Henthorn.
I'm just following orders
to keep an eye on you.
Personally, I don't give
a damn who you date.
I've been volunteering here
since I was 16.
It's not about Sean.
You volunteer for anything? Ever?
Mr. Fredrickson.
Come on, stop.
Gracie gave you beet seed
in exchange for 3% of your farm crop.
That 3% is mine now.
The store was left to me.
I can't do that, Dale.
Things have gotten worse now.
I need it for my family,
to feed the last of my livestock.
I'm sorry.
It's the law, Mr. Fredrickson.
It's rightfully mine.
There are no more laws, son.
No.
I volunteered.
So. What do I do?
Empty. Clean. Repeat.
Where the hell is Eric?
Nobody knows.
Dad's getting Bill on it.
Her blood pressure's dropping.
- I'm feeling contractions.
- I think she's going into labor.
No, no, I can't.
The baby's only 16 weeks.
I need, I need ritodrine
to stop the labor.
I already checked.
We don't have any more.
I'll try to find some nifedipine.
All right, now what are you feeling?
If I lose consciousness,
and you can't find any medicine,
use alcohol.
What do you mean?
What kind of alcohol?
Anything coming out of the still.
Give me a 10% drip.
It'll stop the contractions.
Oh, God, she's bleeding.
Get Kenchy. Now!
I'm so cold my mouth is numb.
We need the logs or we're
going to freeze to death.
Isn't that what we're doing now?
All right. Let's get in the car.
Blanket.
Let's turn on the heat.
We can't. I'm sorry.
We won't have enough gas to get home.
You know, we could make our own heat.
Don't get any ideas...
I'm not taking my clothes off.
You know how happy you make me.
I'm still not taking my clothes off.
Come on!
What's her pressure?
- You smell like a wino.
- Nice to meet you too.
- What's her pressure, please ?
- 80/44 and dropping.
- Is she dilated?
- Two centimeters.
Her contractions are six minutes apart.
I need an ultrasound.
I brought some old ones
up from the basement.
I'll go check on them now.
- Do we have fresh plasma?
- No.
I need you to find somebody...
- With O-negative blood.
- Yes.
And we need
a fetal heart monitor.
Do we have that?
No?
I need you to put these on
and monitor the baby's heart rate.
Here, put these in your ear.
I'll show you how to listen.
I'm deaf.
Madam?
I need you to put these in ears.
I need you to monitor
the baby's heart rate.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I will show you how.
Come on, let's go! Please!
Here we go. Put these on.
Listen right here.
Now, the higher one,
the fast one.
You hear that?
That's the baby's heart rate.
You count 15 seconds,
and then you multiply
that by four.
- To get the beats per minute.
- Perfect
now I will show you
how to take blood pressure
and pulse rate.
All right, let's get ready to lift it.
You want me to settle
a contract dispute?!
Mr. Fredrickson isn't giving
Dale his share.
You're kidding me, right?
I'm trying to get power restored.
I got home robberies all over town.
The refugees are threatening
to break into the food lockup.
Okay, we're going to go on three.
One...
two...
three.
There we go.
A little higher, a little higher.
Okay, easy
Got it.
Watch the rope.
There you go.
Keep it going.
Almost there.
You got enough on your side?
Keep it taut.
Good job, fellas.
How's the baby?
I don't know.
How close is this?
I don't know, hours, at least.
Did you find Eric?
No. Bill and the rangers
are out looking for him.
Can we buy some more of these things?
Yeah. Let's talk about it.
<i>Mr. Hawkins!</i>
<i>I'm back!</i>
<i>Mr. Hawkins, you around?</i>
Just a second!
You weren't answering
your front door, so I just...
You doing some yard work?
You need a hand?
No. No, thank you.
I was going to turn some compost.
Getting ready to plant
food for the spring.
That's a good idea.
Margaret's planting carrots inside.
They're a super-food,
you know...
like broccoli.
You need something, Jimmy?
Gray wants me to find out
what kind of resources
Sarah might've taken with her, you know?
Fuel, food. Did she...
drive out of town?
- She didn't drive.
Took a backpack.
Some food...
a tent.
Then just walked out into the cold, huh?
That's crazy.
Maybe Darcy knows something more.
No, I don't think so.
I just figured,
you know, women talk, and who knows
what the hell they say, right?
Is Darcy around?
Can I...
can I speak with her?
Darcy and I are having problems.
She's moved out.
Boy, that's tough.
A lot of people leaving you lately, huh?
I'm-I'm sorry.
That's insensitive. I...
I will get my coat.
I'll take you to her, Jimmy.
Really?
<i>Hey, how are your, uh,
communication skills?</i>
You know, 'cause that's really
what marriage is all about.
<i>Honesty, love.</i>
<i>I'd say it's 50-50.</i>
<i>Sort of like half and half, you know?</i>
Well, actually, more like thirds,
if you throw respect in there.
<i>But not equal thirds, 'cause honesty...</i>
<i>is more important than
the love and the respect.</i>
<i>I think.</i>
You got one of the only
salt mines around for 400 miles.
A year without salt, and New Bern
will be a ghost town.
What are we talking about,
a couple hundred pounds?
No, we need a lot more than that.
- We're going to need food.
- No food to spare.
Won't see another crop till spring.
Spring crop's what I'm talking about.
Ten wind turbines for,
let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.
Spring crop might not even
get us to next year.
If we lose ten percent, we'll just be
in the same position we are now.
Worse.
Look, all we're asking you
to do is be reasonable.
Well, we're just trying to survive.
Starve next fall or freeze
this winter...
take your pick.
Vancomycin... good.
Start a drip: 250 milligrams IV.
I'll do it.
We found four people who are O-negative.
- Fetal heart rate is 169.
- I'll get it off the ultrasound.
Her blood pressure is 130/70.
Her respiratory rate is 18,
and her pulse is 88, it's going up.
She's losing blood.
Her heart's compensating
by pumping harder.
Start an IV for the blood.
What do you see?
- Placenta previa.
- What's that?
The placenta is covering
the entire cervix.
There's no way for me to find out
where the bleed is coming from
unless we operate.
Well, what are we going to do?
Under the best of circumstances,
this is not an operating facility.
- Then we don't have a choice.
- Cannot operate here.
Why?
I have been through this more times
than you could possibly imagine.
We've all been through a lot, all right?
Just tell us...
I have seen
hundreds of people die
because of dirty facilities
and infection
and because I didn't have
the proper medicine
or the equipment
that I needed.
I am not doing it again.
We are not losing this baby.
You can find yourself another butcher.
There's got to be a way.
Kenchy. Listen,
we need a sterile operating room,
sterile instruments,
anesthesia, spinal block tray,
caesarian tray.
Have you ever even seen a surgery
performed without
an electrocautery machine?
No, you haven't. Because
this doesn't even taught anymore.
Can't we just use laparotomy
sponges to stop the bleeding?
God, my head is killing me.
We've got several spinal block trays,
and we've got anesthesia.
And we can boil
the sheets and the tools.
Is it possible?
- Remotely.
- Then start.
- We need bleach.
- What?
Bleach.
You know? Bleach.
Bonnie, look at my lips.
Bleach !
Learn.
- Is that the word for "bleach"?
- No.
"Bitch."
And... "please."
And "sorry."
I'm heading out.
If I'm not back, lock up at dark
and don't let anyone in.
Also, if I'm not around ever
and you need anything,
just talk to Gail Green or Johnston.
You can trust them.
I'm going to come with you.
Why?
Two against one.
Hey, Bill.
What's wrong?
I just jumped in.
It was...
It was just in the moment.
You volunteered at the medical center
long before I ever get here.
It's fine.
Kenchy just doesn't know you.
Everybody else respects you.
They speak your language.
- Hey, we got a problem.
- What's that?
Eddie and Frank are asking
how come you're not making the deal.
Words are gonna start to spread.
As far as they know,
the marines said that
the army corp of engineers would
be here within the month.
What difference does it make if we give
New Bern a part of next year's profit?
They think there's going
to be food by then.
You didn't want to tell them it was
a bunch of crap, so now what do we do?
All right,
maybe we should tell the town
that help's not coming.
We just told them that to give 'em
something to get through winter.
Town's already on the edge,
you'll have anarchy.
And I'm not leverage
next winter's food,
that'd be suicide.
What if we tell New Bern that
we'll give them
10% of next year's crop.
We get power now.
If next year we don't have
the food to give, we don't give it up.
That's how wars get started.
I can't believe Darcy is staying
at the refugee shelter.
Hey, Jim,
let me talk to her a second.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I asked you to stay away.
Jimmy wanted to ask you
some questions...
about Sarah.
Where are the kids?
They're in the gym, playing.
We need a consistent cover story.
What'd you do with her body?
I buried her.
So I can tell them that right now,
and never see you again.
I could tell him about...
- What did you call it... "the package"?
- Stop it!
You understand the story?
Family? New Orleans?
And you don't know
anything else about her.
This'll just take a sec.
Yeah, well, I don't want
to talk to you in front of him.
Why don't you give us
a minute, Mr. Hawkins?
I'll be out front...
let you two talk.
You're going to be okay, angel.
Did you ever do
a surgical rotation?
Only in school.
Most of my career was in post-op.
I feel obligated to ask you
if you're sober enough to do this.
You can talk me through it.
You will refer to me
as Dr. Dhuwalia, Nurse.
And my sobriety is not the issue.
The people I call "doctor"
don't smell like a brewery.
Respirations are 16.
Pulse rate is 82.
Her blood pressure's down to 100/62.
God help us.
- Is the baby okay?
- I don't know.
Mom said there's a problem.
We were just
collecting firewood.
You don't have
to explain it to me.
What about Mom?
Don't worry about that.
Shut the door.
We're losing too much blood.
Clamp it off.
Get away from the incision!
I need to hear
if the baby's in distress.
Get away from the incision.
You haven't let me get
a pulse from this baby in an hour.
Respirations are 16, pulse is 84.
Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.
You're not close enough to the fetus.
It's not an accurate measurement.
The placenta's grown into
the uterus wall. It's ripping away.
- That's what's causing the bleeding.
- Now I've lost it.
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?
The baby's heart beat has stopped.
- What do you mean, it's stopped?
- Do something.
That must be
the last of the diesel.
Open the door.
Open the blinds.
I need light.
Why aren't you doing
something about the baby?
This hasn't been about
the baby for several hours.
The baby never really had a chance.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you saying?
I am trying to save April.
- What do you want?
- Same thing as before.
- My share of the crop.
- I told you I can't do that. Go home.
I'm only asking for what's mine.
You said there's no law, right?
I'm not trying to cheat anybody.
I don't have that much left.
Then give my share
of whatever you got.
Right now.
- What's going on?
- I... I just...
need some space right now.
We lost the baby.
Oh, sweetie...
I need to be
with April right now.
What took you so long?
Well after...
talking with Darcy, uh...
a lot of things are starting
to make sense now.
You all right, Mr. Hawkins?
I'm fine.
Well, Darcy said...
that Sarah left for New Orleans,
just like you told me.
What? You think I was lying?
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.
She doesn't need
to be staying in the shelter.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
We found a body, Robert.
Out in the woods.
Near Mill Creek.
Broken neck.
Animals got to it.
Michael Connor was on patrol,
said he saw
an African-American woman
driving out that way
a couple nights ago.
Perfect description of Sarah Mason.
Really?
Think she could do
something like that?
I don't know.
You know,
I'm learning that, uh...
it's hard to figure what
people are capable of, Jimmy.
Well, our John Doe was bald.
Know anyone looks like that?
If Sarah comes back...
we'd really, really
like to talk to her.
My guess is...
she's not coming back.
That'd be my guess, too.
New Bern's all made of clay,
can't grow nothing.
We need 10% of your spring crop,
and 700 pounds refined salt.
Well, y-you said 500 earlier.
- Price went up.
- Why?
Because that's what
power costs in this world.
Oh, now, come on...
We got people freezing
to death in their homes.
Give us a break.
You were at my son's wedding.
I'm sorry for your troubles.
But we got our own.
We'll give you the food.
We'll give you the salt.
Everything.
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.
What guarantee do we have
you'll give us our share of the crop?
You have our word.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
We can take them
back with us now.
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?
Human beings as collateral?
I would never do that.
But I am not going
to build these things on credit.
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.
Just hold the pressure.
Put pressure right there.
Right there.
Press, harder!
Damn it! I can't see!
I- I'll get another lantern.
You can bring ten lanterns.
Doesn't make any difference.
It's not going to be enough.
I need real light!
Blood pressure is down to 66/30.
This is crazy.
This is crazy. Close her up.
But we haven't stopped
the bleeding.
- What are you doing?
- Give her some peace.
Give her some dignity.
You are not giving up on her.
I'm sorry.
Close this up.
Where do you think you're going?
You get back inside, right now!
- Come on!
- Take it easy.
Take it easy, all right?
Just let me handle this.
Let me handle it.
What are you doing?
You want me to say it
in front of him?
Go back inside, all right?
April needs you.
To go on operating
is cruel and pointless.
Don't even ask me, Jake.
I'm done with this.
I became a plastic surgeon
so I could have the simple, easy life
that other man face.
- Not in this town.
- I don't care.
I'm not going through this anymore.
It is madness.
And everyone here
can just go to hell?
If you stop trying, and I stop,
then they see that.
And this whole thing falls apart.
We're all leaning on each other here,
whether you like it or not.
Promise me
you are not saying
that we're all connected.
This is not some existential,
web-of-life BS.
That is not what I'm hearing,
is it, Jake?
Then tell me
what you want to hear.
'Cause I'll say anything,
if you'll just go back in there
and keep trying.
She's going to die.
I know.
Okay. New gloves.
Let's get this bleeding
stopped, shall we?
- Well, we've got more sponges.
- Excellent!
Pack them in others vascular bleeding.
Just give me time to suture.
He's going to need you.
Now.
Hold my hand.
I'm right here.
I'm right next to you.
I like the name Tracy.
Tracy's a beautiful name.
Thank you for not saying anything.
I didn't do it for you,
I did it for Allison.
I need my family to come home.
I, uh...
I need you.
You know, in the last
three months,
I remembered all the reasons
why I need you in my life.
So have I.
I've also remembered
why it can never work.
I need truth, Robert, and that's
something you've never given me.
- Everything I do, I do for us.
- Listen.
When you hide a part of yourself,
I don't care what the reason is...
it puts something between us.
Please.
My daughter just killed a woman.
I don't have any more trust to give you.
So, I got the kids with
Margaret back at the house.
What can I carry?
This.
Hang in there.
I got faith in you guys.
Sorry?
The wind turbine's working.
Mrs. Hodges, how are you doing?
- Not so hot.
- Let's get you checked out again.
Dr. Dhuwalia.
Mrs. Hodges' cough is worse.
Her temperature is 102.
- Hello, Mrs. Hodges.
- I'm Dr. Dhuwalia.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Why don't you go outside
and get a pan of boiling hot water
build a tent with a sheet. We need to
get this lady breathing some moist air.
Take a deep breath.
There we go.
That was incredible!
Did you see the look on his face?
I know, I thought he
was going to have a heart attack,
and we were going to have
to drive him to the medical center.
I think we're going to be okay.
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to be there...
with you.
<i>You men are the only ones
who really know what's going on here.</i>
When New Bern gets
their share of the spring crop,
you'll be allowed to return.
I know that sounds like a long time,
but what you are about to do
means this town's survival.
Now you've...
I know your families want some time
to say good-bye. So let's get going.
Promise me something...
Promise you won't kill
Mimi while I'm gone.
And you'll give her food.
Why do you have to go?
People are going to die if we
don't get these wind turbines...
You're all have.
I'll be back.
Take care of Bonnie, okay?
Look, I just want to tell you something.
- And don't freak out, okay?
- I won't.
In this...
crazy world we don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow and...
I don't wanna leave
anything unsaid, so...
I'm just going to say it, okay?
So here I go...
I've loved you since the
first day I saw you at Bailey's.
You said it... you said it first.
No one's ever said
it first to me before.
I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow, and...
Plus,
I can hold it over you
for the rest of our lives.
I love you, Stanley Richmond.
But I said it first.
It wasn't your fault, Eric.
You don't have to do this.
I can't be here right now.
I can't.
Take care, son.
Be strong.
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mom.
We'll take care of Mary.
All right, let's move out.
My dad told me what's happening.
First you're helping us, and now this...
What the hell's going on?
They're going to be fine.
I'm going to look after them.
- You have to trust me on this.
- Trust?
This isn't me.
Where's Heather?
She's fine. I told her we were making
the trip. She didn't want to come.
Truth.
If anything happens to any of them,
you're the first one I come for.
I know.

<i>Précédemment dans </i>Jericho</i>
Certains étaient en avion
et se sont posés au
milieu de nulle part.
Ils ont marché des semaines.
Ils ont dű vivre l'enfer.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Avec notre consommation actuelle,
nous serons ŕ court de carburant
dans 2 semaines.
Il y a une femme dans
le groupe de réfugiés
que Bill interroge.
Vous devriez lui parler.
Salut, Rob.
Quelqu'un de l'équipe
nous a tous vendus.
Tu sais trčs bien qu'ils auraient dit
n'importe quoi pour te faire parler.
<i>"On se sert de sa famille"
Va chercher le paquet.
Nous sommes des
Marines américains,
et nous venons vous aider.
Nous allons rétablir la lumičre,
l'électricité...
et les infrastructures du Kansas,
une ville aprčs l'autre.
Il y quelque chose qui cloche
dans tout ça. Crois-moi.
Ils ont quelqu'un aux abords de la ville
qui se fait passer pour leur QG.
Tout ça est bien réel ?
- Le flingue l'est.
- Les mains en l'air ! Levez-les !
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire d'eux ?
Vous laisserez vos armes
sur le tank,
et vous partez.
- Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire de ça ?
- Stanley...
y'a de la place dans ta grange ?
- Sérieusement ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Un tank peut toujours
s'avérer utile.
Tu fais trop de bruit.
Désolée.
Oů il est allé ?
Il est lŕ.
- C'est fermé.
- On devrait pas entrer.
Entre lŕ-dedans.
- Et pourquoi ?
- On pourra manger.
Tu le vois ?
Katie ?
<i>Jake, il y a une file d'attente.
<i>Tu as entendu parler du tank ?
<i>Ces Marines sont revenus
ou quoi ?</i>
<i>Calmez-vous ! Il y en aura
pour tout le monde.</i>
<i>Vous aurez vos rations !</i>
<i>S'il vous plaît, s'il vous plaît,
reculez !</i>
Comment Gray gčre-t-il tout ça ?
Rentre. Je crois qu'on
est vraiment mal cette fois.
<i>Vous leur avez demandé de se
rationner en attendant les Marines.
Les Marines ne viendront pas,
et vous le saviez depuis le début.
Nous avons fait de notre mieux.
Il fallait leur donner
un peu d'espoir.
Et aprčs tout...
avant de venir ici, les réfugiés
n'avaient pas de rations du tout.
Tu étais au courant ?
Que ce n'était pas
de vrais Marines ?
Oui, mais... on ne leur
a rien donné.
Et Gray a raison. On ne peut pas
laisser les gens perdre espoir.
L'espoir n'empęchera personne
de mourir de faim.
Je connais une femme,
trop faible pour se déplacer !
C'est mathématique.
Il y a vos amis, et 50 autres
qui sont arrivés depuis.
Trop de personnes...
et pas assez de nourriture.
On doit absolument réduire le
nombre de bouches ŕ nourrir.
Et si on commençait...
par ne plus rien donner aux étrangers ?
<i>"Sarah, ętes-vous pręte"
"ŕ livrer le paquet ?"
<i>"Votre prix sera le mien."
<i>"Pręte. Oů nous rencontrons-nous ?"
Et si on réduisait les
rations de moitié...
ŕ nouveau.
Pour la nourriture, OK,
mais les médicaments ?
Ils étaient déjŕ malades en arrivant, et
ils utilisent nos médicaments depuis.
Pouvons-nous tenir jusqu'au
printemps, Harry ?
Certains d'entre nous.
Pas tous.
La criminalité a augmenté
depuis qu'ils sont lŕ.
C'est le cas depuis
les explosions !
On n'a pas le choix.
Les chiffres parlent d'eux-męmes.
- Regardez-les.  - Je n'ai pas besoin,
j'en ręve toutes les nuits.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
S'il vous plaît ?
Écoutez-moi, s'il vous plaît !
J'ai le regret de vous annoncer
que la ville n'a plus les moyens
de vous prendre en charge.
Donc s'il vous plaît, si vous
pouviez ramasser vos affaires,
et vous serez escortés jusqu'ŕ
un camp de la FEMA vers l'I-70.
On est déjŕ allés dans
un de ces camps.
On a failli ne pas en sortir vivants.
La FEMA a des médicaments et des
provisions que nous n'avons pas.
Vous avez entendu le Maire.
Préparez vos affaires.
Qu'allez-vous faire,
nous jeter en prison ?
Parfait.
Si ce n'était pas indispensable...
je ne le ferai pas.
- Nous avons travaillé !
On est allé chercher du bois !
Jessica vous a aidé ŕ l'hôpital.
Je suis navré.
Mais si vous nous jetez sur...
Le sujet est clos.
Vous avez raison.
Parce que nous restons.

Tu as quelque chose ?
Du bruit de fond.
Rien de nouveau.
Tout le monde sait
pour le tank...
c'est plus la peine
de cacher la radio.
Je la rapporterai au
Bailey's plus tard.
C'est assez embarrassant.
Gray essaye de virer les réfugiés.
Ils se sont barricadés
dans l'église.
Quelqu'un a été blessé ?
Il y a une autre issue ?
Non. Ils l'ont bloquée aussi.
Écoute, Roger...
je suis désolé, mais...
On a découvert vos mensonges...
et maintenant vous
vous vengez sur eux.
On a recueilli presque cent
personnes depuis les bombes.
Tu en as amenées plus de 50.
On a fait notre B-A.
Il est temps de partager
ce fardeau.
- Ces camps de la FEMA...
- C'est la jungle lŕ-bas !
Les renvoyer maintenant serait
comme les condamner ŕ mort.
Vous ętes allé dehors,
tu sais de quoi je parle.
Écoute, il s'agit de survie.
Et les habitants de Jericho
passent en premiers.
C'est eux ou nous.
Laisse-moi parler ŕ Gray.
Emily et toi, essayez de ramener
les réfugiés ŕ la raison.
Ne donne pas ŕ Gray des raisons
d'aggraver la situation.
Gray ne peut pas se débarrasser
d'eux comme ça.
C'est sa décision.
Et on va rester lŕ
sans rien faire ?
On peut leur donner
des vętements chauds.
On a déjŕ donné tout
ce qu'on pouvait !
Et bien, il y a...
Quoi ?
Les affaires d'April ?
Kyle, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
On ne partira pas sans se battre.
- C'est une mauvaise idée.
- Et tu proposes quoi ?
On enlčve les barricades...
on sort sans arme,
et on discute avec eux...
pour rester jusqu'ŕ
la fin de l'hiver.
Discuter...
c'est ça ton plan ?
- Tu ne connais pas ces gens.
- Apparemment, on est deux.
Oů avez-vous trouvé
cette nourriture ?
Vous l'avez volée.
Tu es entré chez eux ?
Dis-moi que tu n'as jamais
fait ça dehors ?
Oui, mais lŕ c'est différent.
Ils ont pris soin de nous !
<i>On</i> a pris soin de nous !
Parce qu'on savait qu'un jour
on en arriverait lŕ.
Qu'est-ce que tu vois ?
On dirait que le neveu de
Simmons garde le hangar.
Je vois pas comment rentrer.
Tu dois le faire.
Tu leur as donné de l'essence,
et tu n'as rien eu en retour.
Tu ne peux pas les laisser
continuer ŕ t'arnaquer.
C'est facile ŕ dire pour toi.
Cette fois, c'est moi qui y vais.
Trčs drôle.
Quoi ? Tu penses ętre le seul
ŕ avoir des couilles ici ?
- Ouais.
- Tu veux parier ?
Oublie, Skylar. Simmons est pas une
mauviette comme Frederickson.
Moi non plus.
Attends !
Tu pourrais te blesser.
Tu te fais du souci pour moi ?
C'est trop mignon.
Alors, admire le travail.
J'ai trouvé !
Gaz lacrymo ?
Gray, ça fait des années
qu'elles sont lŕ.
Ne faites pas ça, Gray.
J'ai offert l'asile ŕ ces gens.
Révérend, ça regarde
la police maintenant.
Tu outrepasses tes droits,
ils n'ont commis aucun crime.
- Je me porte garant pour eux.
- Et aprčs, vous allez les nourrir ?
Vous allez pouvoir les
guérir, Révérend ?
Je ne crois pas.
C'est quoi ce bruit ?
Ils barricadent les fenętres.
On aurait pu s'arręter dans
plein d'autres villes,
mais tu n'arrętais pas de dire que
notre seul salut était Jericho.
Alors, on a continué ŕ marcher, ŕ perdre
les nôtres, tout ça pour ça ?
Pousse-toi, Johnston !
Je sais ce que je fais.
On n'a jamais voulu les utiliser en
souvenir du carnage de Waco.
Le FBI a utilisé du gaz lacrymo,
et ils garantissent que ce n'était
pas la raison de l'incendie.
- Tu veux prendre le risque ?
- Papa !
Prendre une ville en otage...
le jeu n'en vaut pas la chandelle.
Ce n'est pas un jeu pour toi !
Tous les soirs, tu peux rentrer
chez toi au chaud.
Je te l'ai déjŕ dit...
je suis de ton côté.
Et tu feras quoi quand on se fera
chasser de la ville ?
<i>Venez !
Que faites-vous ?
Dégagez de lŕ !
Je ne sens pas son pouls.
Hank !
Merci mon Dieu.
Il y a des hommes sur la route !
- Des hommes ? Mais qui ?
- Ils sont avec Ravenwood.
Ton oncle est lŕ ?
- Non, je suis seul.
- Il faut se cacher !
Bon, d'accord.
Viens !
Ils étaient combien ?
Je sais pas.
5, peut-ętre 6.
Je les vois pas.
Tu sais... je pense que tu les
verras mieux depuis le fenil.
Je te suis.
Arręte !
T'inquičte pas, je t'attends.
<i>"Changement de programme."
<i>"Venez me retrouver."
<i>"Une fille n'est jamais trop prudente."
<i>"Oů ?"
<i>"Route 83."
<i>"Sortie des entrepôts 17."
Il manque un des réfugiés.
Que les rangers fouillent
les granges.
Prenez des chiens s'il faut.
Et pour les autres ?
Emmenez-les au centre médical
qu'on s'occupe d'eux.
Et aprčs, renvoyez-les.
Et pour la nourriture que
vous leur avez promise ?
Donnez-leur.
- Aprčs ce qu'ils ont fait ?
- Discute pas, fais-le...
avant que quelqu'un
d'autre soit blessé !
Ce n'est pas trop tard.
Laissez-les rester
jusqu'au printemps.
Vous croyez que je
n'y ai pas pensé ?
Il n'y a pas de miracle.
- Ils n'ont rien fait de mal, Gray...
- Et ?
Des innocents meurent
tous les jours.
Il faut se rendre ŕ l'évidence.
C'est comme aux chaises musicales,
et la musique vient de s'arręter !
Mon Dieu !
Je vous en prie, laissez-moi !
Laissez-moi !
Une centaine de meurtres, Gray.
C'est ce dont tu seras
accusé si tu les chasses.
On les a nourris, logés, chauffés...
Mes amis se sont sacrifiés pour
donner ŕ des étrangers.
Alors, n'essaye pas de
me donner de leçon !
Tu es responsable de tout
ce qu'il leur arrive !
Laissez-moi partir,
je vous en prie !
- Je ne vous veux pas de mal !
- Je vous en prie !
Tu ne partiras pas...
avant que ce soit réglé !
C'est réglé !
Laisse-moi passer !
- Ils n'iront nulle part.
- Tu veux parier ?
Prenez ce que vous voulez...
et partez !
Pour aller oů ?
La police tient les réfugiés
sous bonne garde...
d'une façon ou d'une autre,
ils s'en iront.
Arrętez !
Arrętez-vous !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Gray était armé.
C'est un accident.
Mon cul !
Il m'a tiré dessus !
Il saigne beaucoup.
Il lui faut un docteur.
- Kenchy.
- Non, Jessica.
Ta gueule !
C'est pas toi qui diriges.
Va chercher Jessica, OK ?
On peut lui faire confiance.
- Ça va aller ?
- Ouais.
Qu'est-ce que vous cherchez ?
De la superglue.
La semelle de mes bottes n'a pas
résisté ŕ notre voyage.
Les bottes de mon fils
devraient vous aller.
Je préfčre réparer les miennes.
Pourquoi ?
C'est tout ce qui
m'appartient encore.
Oů allez-vous aller ?
Je n'en ai aucune idée.
Ma famille habitait ŕ Chicago.
J'aimerais qu'on puisse
faire plus pour vous.
M'dame...
il y a plein de maisons
vides ŕ Jericho,
et on dort dans un abri.
Ces maisons sont
ŕ nos voisins.
Ils étaient absents pendant
les explosions.
Ils reviendront.
Et bien, oů qu'ils soient...
j'espčre que personne n'essaye
de les expulser en plein hiver.
<i>"Je suis arrivé."
<i>"Oů ętes-vous ?"
<i>"Vers les quais de chargement."
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Gray est gričvement blessé.
- Je suis occupée.
- Aide-nous !
- Va chercher Kenchy !
- Roger ne lui fait pas confiance.
Tu veux que je m'occupe
de Gray Anderson ?
Si Gray meurt,
alors Roger aussi.
Personne ne lui pardonnera.
S'il te plaît !
Tout se finira bien.
J'essayais juste de les aider.
Maintenant..., il n'y a aucune
chance qu'ils restent.
C'était un accident.
J'étais lŕ.
Gray...
jusqu'au printemps.
C'est tout ce que je demande.
Par ici !
Tu avais raison.
C'est de ma faute.
Je les ai amenés ici.
C'est vrai...
Je l'ai fait pour des
raisons personnelles.
Ne les blâme pas...
Je t'en prie.
Jusqu'au printemps.
Va te faire foutre.
Jessica est avec moi.
Laisse-nous rentrer.
Il faut que je l'examine.
Tu leur laisses une chance...
je te laisse une chance.
J'allais vous donner des
provisions, une escorte...
On ne s'en sortirait
pas dehors...
tu le sais bien.
On doit rester ici.
Tu préfčres mourir
ŕ la place ?
Il est notre seul moyen
de pression.
Roger,
ça ne te ressemble pas.
J'ai survécu dehors
pendant 3 mois...
tu n'as aucune idée de ce que
je peux faire si j'y suis forcé.
<i>- Vous l'avez vue ?
- Non.
<i>Fouillez les bâtiments.
<i>Elle est forcément quelque part.
<i>"Je suis inquičte."
<i>"Rendez-vous ŕ l'endroit initial."
Attendez.
<i>Elle a encore changé le
lieu de rendez-vous.
<i>On se retrouve sur la route.
Bill, non !
Tu crois que ça me fait plaisir ?
Roger est un ami, mais le Maire
va se vider de son sang.
Et si tu le rates ?
Si tu touches Emily ?
Lâche-moi !
Si j'en ai l'occasion...,
je n'hésiterai pas.
Putain !
Il a besoin d'aide.
Il ne voulait pas faire ça.
Peu importe ce qu'on veut, non ?
C'est ce qu'on fait qui compte.
J'ai tout fait pour nous amener ici.
Je leur avais promis,
on devait rester tous ensemble.
- Et tu as réussi.
- Ouais.
Emily, la majorité d'entre
nous s'en est tiré.
19 y sont restés...
Que se passe-t-il ?
Je me souviens du visage
de chacun d'entre eux.
- La fenętre !
- Jake, qu'est-ce que...
- Je t'avais dit de rester dehors !
- Éloigne-toi de la fenętre !
Roger, éloigne-toi
de la fenętre !
Roger, éloigne-toi
de la fenętre !
Si tu veux que tes amis
restent en vie...
tu ferais mieux d'arręter tes
conneries et de m'écouter !
Roger, il est lŕ pour nous aider.
Je t'écoute.
On pourrait vous donner
des véhicules...
de la nourriture, et de l'essence.
Pour qu'on crčve lŕ dehors ?
- C'est ŕ ça que tu penses ?
- Non !
Vous rejoindrez tous
ces gens en exode...
aller vers le sud,
loin de l'hiver.
Ce n'est pas ŕ toi d'en décider.
Toi non plus, si tu meurs !
On ne va pas rester ici
indéfiniment.
Il faut en finir.
Ensuite,
inutile d'espérer rester.
Ils vous foutront dehors
sans rien.
Il nous faudra des armes.
Ça, je peux pas.
Et comment protéger une centaine
de personnes avec ce que j'ai ?
Laisse d'abord Jessica emmener
Gray au centre médical.
Il ne bouge pas d'ici.
Roger, si la balle n'est pas ressortie,
je vais devoir l'opérer.
Marché conclu ?
Assure-toi que tout est pręt...
et je le laisserai partir.
Salut, Allie.
Papa, tu ne peux pas rester ici.
Maman va péter les plombs.
Ça ne sera pas long.
Viens par lŕ.
Alors...
Je voulais juste savoir
comment vous allez.
Vous ętes bien installé
chez Jimmy ?
- Ouais, mais il arręte pas de parler.
- Oui...
Il peut pas s'en empęcher.
Comment va Sam ?
Tu sais, il a peur.
Et toi ?
Ça va.
Écoute...
ce que tu as dű faire
pour Sarah...
je sais ŕ quel point ça peut
marquer quelqu'un.
Papa...
ne t'en fais pas pour moi.
Je ne suis pas comme
Sam, ni Maman.
Alors...
tu ne vivras plus jamais
avec nous, hein ?
En tout cas pour l'instant,
ça ne serait pas une bonne idée.
Alors, ne t'inquičte pas.
Je m'occuperai d'eux.
Viens lŕ.
Ne cherche pas ŕ me remplacer.
Merci pour votre aide.
Restez calme.
C'est mon boulot, vous savez.
Je ne voulais pas faire ça.
Mais je le dois.
On a tous un boulot, qu'on soit
satisfait ou non de le faire.
Tenez bon.
Le car est arrivé.
Quand penses-tu revenir ?
Aprčs ça...
il ne me laissera jamais revenir.
Peut-ętre que je n'aurais
jamais dű les mener ici.
Il y avait d'autres endroits...
d'autres camps...
d'autres villes dont on
nous avait parlé.
Mais je voulais te revoir.
Un réfugié s'est introduit
dans la maison.
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui, oui.
Je vais chercher les gars.
Écoute-moi.
Il faut empęcher ça.
Tout est pręt.
Levez-vous.
Attends, tu ne peux pas l'emmener.
Dčs que mes amis et moi...
seront hors de la ville...
je le laisserai partir.
- Il sera mort d'ici lŕ.
Vous ne pouvez pas
les laisser partir.
Une femme est morte dans
nos rues ce matin.
Je ne connaissais męme
pas son nom.
Et vous ?
Si tu veux un otage,
prends-moi.
Pensez ŕ nos voisins qui
ne sont pas encore revenus.
Voilŕ qui ils pourraient ętre.
Ma famille...
pourrait accueillir 2 personnes.
Qui d'autre voudrait
partager ses rations ?
Ils arrivent !
Allez, reculez !
Poussez-vous !
On peut y arriver, j'en suis sűre.
S'il vous plaît.
Merci, Bob.
Bravo.
Parfait.
Qui d'autre ?
Allez, qui d'autre ?
S'il vous plaît.
Écartez-vous tous !
Reculez !
Baissez vos armes.
Baissez-les.
Reculez !
- Reculez !
- Mon Dieu.
Roger...
c'est fini.
Ils peuvent rester.
On leur a trouvé des foyers.
Baisse ton arme, Roger.
Tu as gagné.
Allez, baisse-la.
Comment va le Maire ?
Jessica a fait des merveilles.
Il...
il a perdu beaucoup de sang,
mais son état est stable.
On lui a demandé de
laisser les gens rester.
Mais...
Pas moi.
Bon...
Je te promettrais bien de
t'appeler, mais...
Je viens avec toi.
Non, ne fais pas ça.
Roger, je suis si...
J'ai fait tout ça...
pour que les personnes que j'aime
soient en sécurité ici.
Je ne me risquerai pas dehors avec
la personne que j'aime le plus.
Je tiendrai le coup.
Pas moi.
Alors, qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
C'est pas encore Saks sur la
5čme Avenue, mais...
c'est pas mal.
Grâce aux affaires qu'on a faites,
on a un vrai comptoir
d'échange, maintenant.
Bonjour, M. Simmons.
Hank.
- Quoi ?
Tu trouves ça drôle ?
J'aurais pu te tirer dessus.
C'est ton oncle, Hank,
qui a essayé de nous arnaquer.
Tu te prends vraiment
pour un homme, hein ?
Rends-moi mon cheval et l'essence,
et je partirai.
Le cheval est attaché dehors,
mais l'essence est ŕ moi.
J'en ai marre de
jouer avec toi.
Hank, prends l'essence.
Je vous présente mes
nouveaux employés.
C'est la maison de...
Jim et Judy Moore.
Ils étaient chez leur petit-fils...
ŕ côté de Philadelphie.
La distribution des rations
est le mardi.
Nous les partagerons avec vous.
Mme Green.
Merci.
<i>"ACHETEUR"
<i>"On ne joue plus, Sarah."
"Je double le prix."
Voilŕ quelques provisions
et de l'eau.
J'aurais aimé faire plus.
Tout ce que je pourrais te dire...
sonnerait faux, alors...
Tu regrettes vraiment
de me voir partir ?
C'est pas ça.
Tiens.
Passe par <i>Cedar Run</i> d'abord,
c'est sans danger.
Et aprčs va vers <i>New Bern</i>.
Heather, Stanley, mon frčre,
ils pourront t'aider lŕ-bas.
Je connais bien le coin.
<i>Des corps ont été retrouvés le long
de la route 400 prčs de Cimarron.
<i>On nous informe également
<i>que des poseurs de bombes ont gagné la
confiance d'élus locaux, ce qui...
Attendez... j'ai déjŕ entendu
cette voix avant.
Ouais, c'est le gars qui commentait les
explosions. Ce sont de vraies infos !
<i>... laboratoires de recherche.
<i>Ŕ New York, les terroristes
qui ont été appréhendés
<i>portaient tous des badges
du FBI parfaitement imités.
<i>Leurs identités n'ont pas
été communiquées.
<i>Les autorités ont accru la sécurité
sur tous les sites sensibles.
Jimmy ?
Jimmy, ça ne va pas ?
<i>Chaque citoyen est incité
ŕ la prudence.
<i>Dčs que nous aurons de nouvelles
informations, nous les transmettrons.
<i>D'ici lŕ, les informations
seront locales.
<i>Prenez soin de vous au Kansas.
[ www.seriessub.com ]
<i>Précédemment dans </i>Jericho</i>
Certains étaient en avion
et se sont posés au
milieu de nulle part.
Ils ont marché des semaines.
Ils ont dű vivre l'enfer.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Avec notre consommation actuelle,
nous serons ŕ court de carburant
dans 2 semaines.
Il y a une femme dans
le groupe de réfugiés
que Bill interroge.
Vous devriez lui parler.
Salut, Rob.
Quelqu'un de l'équipe
nous a tous vendus.
Tu sais trčs bien qu'ils auraient dit
n'importe quoi pour te faire parler.
<i>"On se sert de sa famille"
Va chercher le paquet.
Nous sommes des
Marines américains,
et nous venons vous aider.
Nous allons rétablir la lumičre,
l'électricité...
et les infrastructures du Kansas,
une ville aprčs l'autre.
Il y quelque chose qui cloche
dans tout ça. Crois-moi.
Ils ont quelqu'un aux abords de la ville
qui se fait passer pour leur QG.
Tout ça est bien réel ?
- Le flingue l'est.
- Les mains en l'air ! Levez-les !
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire d'eux ?
Vous laisserez vos armes
sur le tank,
et vous partez.
- Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire de ça ?
- Stanley...
y'a de la place dans ta grange ?
- Sérieusement ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Un tank peut toujours
s'avérer utile.
Tu fais trop de bruit.
Désolée.
Oů il est allé ?
Il est lŕ.
- C'est fermé.
- On devrait pas entrer.
Entre lŕ-dedans.
- Et pourquoi ?
- On pourra manger.
Tu le vois ?
Katie ?
<i>Jake, il y a une file d'attente.
<i>Tu as entendu parler du tank ?
<i>Ces Marines sont revenus
ou quoi ?</i>
<i>Calmez-vous ! Il y en aura
pour tout le monde.</i>
<i>Vous aurez vos rations !</i>
<i>S'il vous plaît, s'il vous plaît,
reculez !</i>
Comment Gray gčre-t-il tout ça ?
Rentre. Je crois qu'on
est vraiment mal cette fois.
<i>Vous leur avez demandé de se
rationner en attendant les Marines.
Les Marines ne viendront pas,
et vous le saviez depuis le début.
Nous avons fait de notre mieux.
Il fallait leur donner
un peu d'espoir.
Et aprčs tout...
avant de venir ici, les réfugiés
n'avaient pas de rations du tout.
Tu étais au courant ?
Que ce n'était pas
de vrais Marines ?
Oui, mais... on ne leur
a rien donné.
Et Gray a raison. On ne peut pas
laisser les gens perdre espoir.
L'espoir n'empęchera personne
de mourir de faim.
Je connais une femme,
trop faible pour se déplacer !
C'est mathématique.
Il y a vos amis, et 50 autres
qui sont arrivés depuis.
Trop de personnes...
et pas assez de nourriture.
On doit absolument réduire le
nombre de bouches ŕ nourrir.
Et si on commençait...
par ne plus rien donner aux étrangers ?
<i>"Sarah, ętes-vous pręte"
"ŕ livrer le paquet ?"
<i>"Votre prix sera le mien."
<i>"Pręte. Oů nous rencontrons-nous ?"
Et si on réduisait les
rations de moitié...
ŕ nouveau.
Pour la nourriture, OK,
mais les médicaments ?
Ils étaient déjŕ malades en arrivant, et
ils utilisent nos médicaments depuis.
Pouvons-nous tenir jusqu'au
printemps, Harry ?
Certains d'entre nous.
Pas tous.
La criminalité a augmenté
depuis qu'ils sont lŕ.
C'est le cas depuis
les explosions !
On n'a pas le choix.
Les chiffres parlent d'eux-męmes.
- Regardez-les.  - Je n'ai pas besoin,
j'en ręve toutes les nuits.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
S'il vous plaît ?
Écoutez-moi, s'il vous plaît !
J'ai le regret de vous annoncer
que la ville n'a plus les moyens
de vous prendre en charge.
Donc s'il vous plaît, si vous
pouviez ramasser vos affaires,
et vous serez escortés jusqu'ŕ
un camp de la FEMA vers l'I-70.
On est déjŕ allés dans
un de ces camps.
On a failli ne pas en sortir vivants.
La FEMA a des médicaments et des
provisions que nous n'avons pas.
Vous avez entendu le Maire.
Préparez vos affaires.
Qu'allez-vous faire,
nous jeter en prison ?
Parfait.
Si ce n'était pas indispensable...
je ne le ferai pas.
- Nous avons travaillé !
On est allé chercher du bois !
Jessica vous a aidé ŕ l'hôpital.
Je suis navré.
Mais si vous nous jetez sur...
Le sujet est clos.
Vous avez raison.
Parce que nous restons.

Tu as quelque chose ?
Du bruit de fond.
Rien de nouveau.
Tout le monde sait
pour le tank...
c'est plus la peine
de cacher la radio.
Je la rapporterai au
Bailey's plus tard.
C'est assez embarrassant.
Gray essaye de virer les réfugiés.
Ils se sont barricadés
dans l'église.
Quelqu'un a été blessé ?
Il y a une autre issue ?
Non. Ils l'ont bloquée aussi.
Écoute, Roger...
je suis désolé, mais...
On a découvert vos mensonges...
et maintenant vous
vous vengez sur eux.
On a recueilli presque cent
personnes depuis les bombes.
Tu en as amenées plus de 50.
On a fait notre B-A.
Il est temps de partager
ce fardeau.
- Ces camps de la FEMA...
- C'est la jungle lŕ-bas !
Les renvoyer maintenant serait
comme les condamner ŕ mort.
Vous ętes allé dehors,
tu sais de quoi je parle.
Écoute, il s'agit de survie.
Et les habitants de Jericho
passent en premiers.
C'est eux ou nous.
Laisse-moi parler ŕ Gray.
Emily et toi, essayez de ramener
les réfugiés ŕ la raison.
Ne donne pas ŕ Gray des raisons
d'aggraver la situation.
Gray ne peut pas se débarrasser
d'eux comme ça.
C'est sa décision.
Et on va rester lŕ
sans rien faire ?
On peut leur donner
des vętements chauds.
On a déjŕ donné tout
ce qu'on pouvait !
Et bien, il y a...
Quoi ?
Les affaires d'April ?
Kyle, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
On ne partira pas sans se battre.
- C'est une mauvaise idée.
- Et tu proposes quoi ?
On enlčve les barricades...
on sort sans arme,
et on discute avec eux...
pour rester jusqu'ŕ
la fin de l'hiver.
Discuter...
c'est ça ton plan ?
- Tu ne connais pas ces gens.
- Apparemment, on est deux.
Oů avez-vous trouvé
cette nourriture ?
Vous l'avez volée.
Tu es entré chez eux ?
Dis-moi que tu n'as jamais
fait ça dehors ?
Oui, mais lŕ c'est différent.
Ils ont pris soin de nous !
<i>On</i> a pris soin de nous !
Parce qu'on savait qu'un jour
on en arriverait lŕ.
Qu'est-ce que tu vois ?
On dirait que le neveu de
Simmons garde le hangar.
Je vois pas comment rentrer.
Tu dois le faire.
Tu leur as donné de l'essence,
et tu n'as rien eu en retour.
Tu ne peux pas les laisser
continuer ŕ t'arnaquer.
C'est facile ŕ dire pour toi.
Cette fois, c'est moi qui y vais.
Trčs drôle.
Quoi ? Tu penses ętre le seul
ŕ avoir des couilles ici ?

Gray était armé.
C'est un accident.

Il m'a tiré dessus !
Il saigne beaucoup.
Il lui faut un docteur.
- Kenchy.
- Non, Jessica.
Ta gueule !
C'est pas toi qui diriges.
Va chercher Jessica, OK ?
On peut lui faire confiance.
- Ça va aller ?
- Ouais.
Qu'est-ce que vous cherchez ?
De la superglue.
La semelle de mes bottes n'a pas
résisté ŕ notre voyage.
Les bottes de mon fils
devraient vous aller.
Je préfčre réparer les miennes.
Pourquoi ?
C'est tout ce qui
m'appartient encore.
Oů allez-vous aller ?
Je n'en ai aucune idée.
Ma famille habitait ŕ Chicago.
J'aimerais qu'on puisse
faire plus pour vous.
M'dame...
il y a plein de maisons
vides ŕ Jericho,
et on dort dans un abri.
Ces maisons sont
ŕ nos voisins.
Ils étaient absents pendant
les explosions.
Ils reviendront.
Et bien, oů qu'ils soient...
j'espčre que personne n'essaye
de les expulser en plein hiver.
<i>"Je suis arrivé."
<i>"Oů ętes-vous ?"
<i>"Vers les quais de chargement."
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Gray est gričvement blessé.
- Je suis occupée.
- Aide-nous !
- Va chercher Kenchy !
- Roger ne lui fait pas confiance.
Tu veux que je m'occupe
de Gray Anderson ?
Si Gray meurt,
alors Roger aussi.
Personne ne lui pardonnera.
S'il te plaît !
Tout se finira bien.
J'essayais juste de les aider.
Maintenant..., il n'y a aucune
chance qu'ils restent.
C'était un accident.
J'étais lŕ.
Gray...
jusqu'au printemps.
C'est tout ce que je demande.
Par ici !
Tu avais raison.
C'est de ma faute.
Je les ai amenés ici.
C'est vrai...
Je l'ai fait pour des
raisons personnelles.
Ne les blâme pas...
Je t'en prie.
Jusqu'au printemps.
Va te faire foutre.
Jessica est avec moi.
Laisse-nous rentrer.
Il faut que je l'examine.
Tu leur laisses une chance...
je te laisse une chance.
J'allais vous donner des
provisions, une escorte...
On ne s'en sortirait
pas dehors...
tu le sais bien.
On doit rester ici.
Tu préfčres mourir
ŕ la place ?
Il est notre seul moyen
de pression.
Roger,
ça ne te ressemble pas.
J'ai survécu dehors
pendant 3 mois...
tu n'as aucune idée de ce que
je peux faire si j'y suis forcé.
<i>- Vous l'avez vue ?
- Non.
<i>Fouillez les bâtiments.
<i>Elle est forcément quelque part.
<i>"Je suis inquičte."
<i>"Rendez-vous ŕ l'endroit initial."
Attendez.
<i>Elle a encore changé le
lieu de rendez-vous.
<i>On se retrouve sur la route.
Bill, non !
Tu crois que ça me fait plaisir ?
Roger est un ami, mais le Maire
va se vider de son sang.
Et si tu le rates ?
Si tu touches Emily ?
Lâche-moi !
Si j'en ai l'occasion...,
je n'hésiterai pas.
Putain !
Il a besoin d'aide.
Il ne voulait pas faire ça.
Peu importe ce qu'on veut, non ?
C'est ce qu'on fait qui compte.
J'ai tout fait pour nous amener ici.
Je leur avais promis,
on devait rester tous ensemble.
- Et tu as réussi.
- Ouais.
Emily, la majorité d'entre
nous s'en est tiré.
19 y sont restés...
Que se passe-t-il ?
Je me souviens du visage
de chacun d'entre eux.
- La fenętre !
- Jake, qu'est-ce que...
- Je t'avais dit de rester dehors !
- Éloigne-toi de la fenętre !
Roger, éloigne-toi
de la fenętre !
Roger, éloigne-toi
de la fenętre !
Si tu veux que tes amis
restent en vie...
tu ferais mieux d'arręter tes
conneries et de m'écouter !
Roger, il est lŕ pour nous aider.
Je t'écoute.
On pourrait vous donner
des véhicules...
de la nourriture, et de l'essence.
Pour qu'on crčve lŕ dehors ?
- C'est ŕ ça que tu penses ?
- Non !
Vous rejoindrez tous
ces gens en exode...
aller vers le sud,
loin de l'hiver.
Ce n'est pas ŕ toi d'en décider.
Toi non plus, si tu meurs !
On ne va pas rester ici
indéfiniment.
Il faut en finir.
Ensuite,
inutile d'espérer rester.
Ils vous foutront dehors
sans rien.
Il nous faudra des armes.
Ça, je peux pas.
Et comment protéger une centaine
de personnes avec ce que j'ai ?
Laisse d'abord Jessica emmener
Gray au centre médical.
Il ne bouge pas d'ici.
Roger, si la balle n'est pas ressortie,
je vais devoir l'opérer.
Marché conclu ?
Assure-toi que tout est pręt...
et je le laisserai partir.
Salut, Allie.
Papa, tu ne peux pas rester ici.
Maman va péter les plombs.
Ça ne sera pas long.
Viens par lŕ.
Alors...
Je voulais juste savoir
comment vous allez.
Vous ętes bien installé
chez Jimmy ?
- Ouais, mais il arręte pas de parler.
- Oui...
Il peut pas s'en empęcher.
Comment va Sam ?
Tu sais, il a peur.
Et toi ?
Ça va.
Écoute...
ce que tu as dű faire
pour Sarah...
je sais ŕ quel point ça peut
marquer quelqu'un.
Papa...
ne t'en fais pas pour moi.
Je ne suis pas comme
Sam, ni Maman.
Alors...
tu ne vivras plus jamais
avec nous, hein ?
En tout cas pour l'instant,
ça ne serait pas une bonne idée.
Alors, ne t'inquičte pas.
Je m'occuperai d'eux.
Viens lŕ.
Ne cherche pas ŕ me remplacer.
Merci pour votre aide.
Restez calme.
C'est mon boulot, vous savez.
Je ne voulais pas faire ça.
Mais je le dois.
On a tous un boulot, qu'on soit
satisfait ou non de le faire.
Tenez bon.
Le car est arrivé.
Quand penses-tu revenir ?
Aprčs ça...
il ne me laissera jamais revenir.
Peut-ętre que je n'aurais
jamais dű les mener ici.
Il y avait d'autres endroits...
d'autres camps...
d'autres villes dont on
nous avait parlé.
Mais je voulais te revoir.
Un réfugié s'est introduit
dans la maison.
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui, oui.
Je vais chercher les gars.
Écoute-moi.
Il faut empęcher ça.
Tout est pręt.
Levez-vous.
Attends, tu ne peux pas l'emmener.
Dčs que mes amis et moi...
seront hors de la ville...
je le laisserai partir.
- Il sera mort d'ici lŕ.
Vous ne pouvez pas
les laisser partir.
Une femme est morte dans
nos rues ce matin.
Je ne connaissais męme
pas son nom.
Et vous ?
Si tu veux un otage,
prends-moi.
Pensez ŕ nos voisins qui
ne sont pas encore revenus.
Voilŕ qui ils pourraient ętre.
Ma famille...
pourrait accueillir 2 personnes.
Qui d'autre voudrait
partager ses rations ?
Ils arrivent !
Allez, reculez !
Poussez-vous !
On peut y arriver, j'en suis sűre.
S'il vous plaît.
Merci, Bob.
Bravo.
Parfait.
Qui d'autre ?
Allez, qui d'autre ?
S'il vous plaît.
Écartez-vous tous !
Reculez !
Baissez vos armes.
Baissez-les.
Reculez !
- Reculez !
- Mon Dieu.
Roger...
c'est fini.
Ils peuvent rester.
On leur a trouvé des foyers.
Baisse ton arme, Roger.
Tu as gagné.
Allez, baisse-la.
Comment va le Maire ?
Jessica a fait des merveilles.
Il...
il a perdu beaucoup de sang,
mais son état est stable.
On lui a demandé de
laisser les gens rester.
Mais...
Pas moi.
Bon...
Je te promettrais bien de
t'appeler, mais...
Je viens avec toi.
Non, ne fais pas ça.
Roger, je suis si...
J'ai fait tout ça...
pour que les personnes que j'aime
soient en sécurité ici.
Je ne me risquerai pas dehors avec
la personne que j'aime le plus.
Je tiendrai le coup.
Pas moi.
Alors, qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
C'est pas encore Saks sur la
5čme Avenue, mais...
c'est pas mal.
Grâce aux affaires qu'on a faites,
on a un vrai comptoir
d'échange, maintenant.
Bonjour, M. Simmons.
Hank.
- Quoi ?
Tu trouves ça drôle ?
J'aurais pu te tirer dessus.
C'est ton oncle, Hank,
qui a essayé de nous arnaquer.
Tu te prends vraiment
pour un homme, hein ?
Rends-moi mon cheval et l'essence,
et je partirai.
Le cheval est attaché dehors,
mais l'essence est ŕ moi.
J'en ai marre de
jouer avec toi.
Hank, prends l'essence.
Je vous présente mes
nouveaux employés.
C'est la maison de...
Jim et Judy Moore.
Ils étaient chez leur petit-fils...
ŕ côté de Philadelphie.
La distribution des rations
est le mardi.
Nous les partagerons avec vous.
Mme Green.
Merci.
<i>"ACHETEUR"
<i>"On ne joue plus, Sarah."
"Je double le prix."
Voilŕ quelques provisions
et de l'eau.
J'aurais aimé faire plus.
Tout ce que je pourrais te dire...
sonnerait faux, alors...
Tu regrettes vraiment
de me voir partir ?
C'est pas ça.
Tiens.
Passe par <i>Cedar Run</i> d'abord,
c'est sans danger.
Et aprčs va vers <i>New Bern</i>.
Heather, Stanley, mon frčre,

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Some of them were on planes
that landed in the middle of nowhere.
They've been walking for weeks.
They must have gone through hell.
Oh, my God.
At the current levels of consumption,
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that
Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.
Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team sold us all out.
You're smart enough to know
that they would say anything
to get you to talk, Sarah.
Get the package.
We're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.
... and those are to restore lights,
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.
Something's wrong about all this,
all right? Trust me.
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.
Is any of this real?
- The gun's real.
- Hands up. Get them up!
What the hell do we do with them?
You will leave your weapons on the tank,
and you will move out!
- What do we do with that?
- Stanley,
got room in your barn?
- Seriously?
- Why not?
Never know when you might need a tank.
You're making too much noise.
Sorry.
Where did it go?
There it is.
- It's locked.
- We shouldn't go in.
Go in here.
- Why do I have to?
- So we can eat.
You see it?
Katie?
<i>Come on, Jake,
there's a line here.
<i>Did you hear about the tank?
<i>Those Marines coming or what?
<i>Everybody, just calm down!
You'll get your share.
<i>You'll get your rations!
<i>People, please, back up!
How is Gray handling this?
You better get in there.
I think we really screwed
ourselves this time.
You said everyone in the shelter gets
half-rations until the Marines come.
Well, the Marines aren't coming,
and you've known all along.
We did the best that we could.
People had to believe
that help was on the way.
And you know what?
Half-rations is a lot more than
those refugees had before they got here.
Did you know about this?
The Marines...
That they were con artists?
Yeah, but we didn't give them
any of our supplies.
And Gray is right. The last thing
this town needs is to lose hope.
Hope won't keep
my friends from starving.
I've got one woman too weak to walk.
It's a mathematical problem.
We've got your friends,
plus another 50 who migrated here.
That's too many people,
and not enough food.
We'll just have to figure out
how to make what we have last.
I say the first thing we do,
is stop giving it away to strangers.
What if we cut
the food rations in half,
again?
It's more than the food.
What about medicine?
Those refugees came here sick.
They've been burning through
our meds for a month.
Can we make it to spring, Harry?
Some of us can. Not all.
Crime's been going up
since they got here.
Crime's been going up
since the bombs.
It's got to be done.
The numbers speak for themselves.
Just look at 'em.
I don't need to look at 'em.
I see them in my sleep.
What are you going to do?
Folks?
Folks, listen up!
I am sorry to say that
the town no longer has the resources
to take care of you.
<i>What?
Where are we supposed to go?
So if you could please
gather up your belongings,
you will be escorted
to a FEMA camp out
- near I-70.
- We've been to those FEMA camps.
We barely made it out
alive the first time.
FEMA has medicine and supplies,
and we don't.
You heard the mayor.
You need to start packing up.
What are you going to do,
put us in jail?
Great.
If I didn't have to do this,
- I wouldn't.
- We've been working!
Okay? We've been chopping wood!
Jessica's been helping you
with your medical center.
I'm sorry.
But if you put us out on the...
This isn't a debate.
You're right.
'Cause we're staying.

Anything?
Static.
No news.
I guess now the secret
about the tank is out,
there's no need to hide the radio.
Yeah. I'll take it down
to Bailey's later.
We can all be annoyed together.
Emily.
Gray's trying to kick out the refugees.
They barricaded themselves
inside the church.
Was anybody hurt?
Is there another door?
No. They blocked that one, too.
Look, Roger, I'm sorry, but...
You lie about the Marines,
you get caught, you need someone
to blame, so you pick them.
We have taken in almost
a hundred people since the bombs.
Roger, you brought over 50 yourself.
We've done our part.
It's time for somebody else
to share the burden.
- Now, these FEMA camps...
- Those FEMA camps are jungles.
Putting anybody out on those streets
is a death sentence.
You've been out there.
You know that.
Look, it comes down to ressources.
All right? And people of Jericho
have to come first.
It's 100 of them or 100 of us.
Let me work on Gray.
You and Emily try and talk
some sense into the refugees.
Don't give Gray
a reason to make this worse.
All right? Gray can't send
these people away like this.
It's his call.
Well, isn't there
something we can do?
Give them warm clothing for the trip.
We've given away
everything we can spare.
Well, there's...
What?
April's things?
Kyle, what are you doing?
We're not leaving here without a fight.
- This is a bad idea.
- What should we do?
We take down the barricade.
We go out unarmed.
We look them in the eye,
and we ask them to stay
till the end of winter.
Look them in the eye.
That's your plan?
- You don't know this town.
- Apparently, that makes two of us.
Where did you get the food from?
You stole it.
You broke into people's houses?
It's not like you didn't do the same
thing when we were out there.
Yeah, well, this is different.
This town took care of us!
We took care of us!
Because we knew,
one day, this town wouldn't.
What do you see?
Looks like Simmons has got
his nephew guarding the shed.
I don't think I can get in.
You have to.
You traded them for that gas,
and they're holding out on you.
You can't let these farmers
get away with it anymore.
It's easy for you to say.
I'll go this time.
Very funny.
What? You think you're
the only badass here?
- Uh... yeah.
- You want to bet?
Forget it, Skylar. Simmons is not
a pushover like Frederickson.
Neither am I.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You could get hurt.
You're worried about me?
That's so sweet.
Now, watch and learn.
Found them!
Tear gas?
Gray, those things been
sitting around for years.
You can't do this, Gray.
I've given these people sanctuary.
Reverend, this is a police matter now.
You have no right
to assault these people.
They've committed no crimes.
- They'll be my responsibility.
- What, are you going to feed them?
What, you got a little hospital
down there, Reverend?
No, I didn't think so.
What's that sound?
They're boarding up the windows.
There were half a dozen other places
we could have stopped,
but you kept talking like Jericho
was the end of the freakin' rainbow.
So we kept walking...
losing people... for this.
Out of my way, Johnston!
I know what I'm doing.
You know why we never used those?
A little thing called Waco happened.
The FBI used tear gas,
and they swear it didn't start
that fire, but it could have.
- You ready to live with that?
- Dad!
We can't hold off a town.
- It's too big a gamble.
- It's not a gamble for you!
You get to go home
to a warm bed every night.
I told you... I'm with you.
What happens when
we get kicked out of this town?
<i>Come on!
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!
<i>She's got no pulse.
Hank! Hank!
- Skylar!
- Thank God. There are men on the road!
- Men? What men?
- They're with Ravenwood.
Is your uncle here?
- No, it's just me.
- We have to hide!
Okay, yeah. Come on!
How many were there?
I don't know. Five, maybe six.
I can't see them.
You know what?
I bet you have
a better view from the hayloft.
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.
Skylar!
Stop!
It's okay. I'll wait.
One of the refugees is still out there.
You have the rangers search the barns.
Use dogs if it'll help.
And the rest of them?
Take them to the med center,
get them fixed up, Harry.
Then send them away.
What about the extra food
you promised them?
Give it to them.
- After what they did to us?
- Will you just do it,
before somebody else gets hurt?!
It's not too late.
Just let them stay until spring.
You think I haven't tried
to make that work?
The numbers don't add up.
- They're good people, Gray. Just...
- And?!
Good people are dying every day!
Someone finally has to tell the truth.
It's musical chairs out there.
The music has stopped!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, get away from me!
Get away from me!
A hundred counts of murder, Gray.
That's what they should charge you with
if you send them away.
We have been feeding them
and we have been heating the shelter.
We've been taking
from my friends
to give to strangers,
so don't you dare lecture me!
Whatever happens to them is on you!
Let me go, please!
- I don't want to hurt you!
- Just let me go, please!
You're not leaving
until this is resolved!
This is resolved!
Get out of my way!
- They're not going anywhere.
- You want to bet?
Just take whatever you want!
Just get out!
And go where?!
I got the entire police force
guarding the refugees,
and one way or another,
they're going.
Hey, stop it!
All right, stop it!
What's going on?
What happened?
Gray pulled a gun.
It was an accident.
Like hell! He shot me!
There's so much blood.
He needs a doctor.
- Get-get Kenchy.
- No, get Jessica.
Shut up!
You're not running things!
Get Jessica, please, all right?
I trust her.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
What are you looking for?
Superglue.
The sole on my boot came apart
after a couple hundred miles.
My son's shoes might fit you.
I'd rather fix these.
Why?
They're all I have left that are mine.
Where are you going to go?
I don't know really.
My family was in Chicago.
I wish there was more
that we could do.
Ma'am,
there are empty houses
all over Jericho,
and we sleep in a shelter.
Those are our neighbors' homes.
They were gone
when the bombs went off.
They're coming back.
Well, wherever your neighbors are,
I hope nobody's kicking them
out of town in the middle of winter.
What the hell happened in there?
- Gray's bleeding badly.
- I'm busy.
- I need your help!
- Get Kenchy.
Look, you're the only
one Roger trusts.
You want me to save
Gray Anderson?
If Gray dies, so does Roger.
People aren't just going
to let it go. Please?
We can all get out of this.
I was just trying to help them.
Now... there's no way the
town lets them stay.
It was an accident.
I saw it.
Gray...
just until spring.
That's all I ask.
Come on!
You were right.
This is on me.
I brought them here.
I did it...
I did it for my own reasons.
But don't punish them,
I'm begging you.
Just till spring.
Go to hell.
I've got Jessica. Let us in.
You need to let me look at him.
You give them a chance...
...I'll give you a chance.
I was going to give you
food, an escort.
We wouldn't survive out there...
you know that.
We have to stay here.
Why would you die over this?!
He's our only leverage.
Roger, this isn't you.
I survived out there
for three months.
You have no idea what
I can do if I have to.
- Any sign of her?
- No.
Check the buildings.
She's got to be around
here somewhere.
Hold up.
She changed the location again.
Meet you back at the road.
Bill, don't!
You think I want to?
Roger's a friend of mine, but I can't
let the mayor bleed to death.
What if you miss?
What if you hit Emily?
Get off me.
If I get the shot, Jake...
I'm taking it.
Damn it.
We have to get him help.
He didn't want to do this.
It doesn't matter what
we want, does it?
It matters what we do.
I tried to get us all back here.
I promised them if we
just stuck together.
- And you did.
- Yeah.
Emily, most of us made it back.
19 of us didn't.
What's going on?
And I remember...
every one of their faces.
- Get away from the window!
- Jake, what are you doing?!
- I told you to stay out!
- Get away from the window!
Get away from the window!
Roger, get away from
the window!
Roger, get away from
the window!
If you want your friends to live...
you better back the hell off
right now and listen to me!
Roger, he's here to help.
I'm listening.
What if we give you
transportation?
And food and fuel?
So we can die out there?
- Guy is that what you think about?
- No!
You can make it to
the migration trail.
Head south and beat the winter.
It's not your decision to make.
Won't be yours either if you're dead.
You can't keep us in here forever.
This will end.
And when it does,
you can forget about staying.
They will kick you out
with nothing.
I'm going to need guns.
I can't give you guns.
I can't protect a hundred
people with what I have.
But you let Jessica take Gray
to the medical center.
He's not leaving.
Roger, if that bullet is still in him,
I'm going to have to open him up.
Is it a deal?
You make sure everything's ready.
I'll let him go.
Hey, Allie.
Dad, you can't be around here.
Mom will freak out.
I won't stay long.
Come on.
So...
I just wanted to know
how you were doing.
Settling in okay at
Jimmy's place?
- Yeah, he just never stops talking.
- No...
He doesn't.
ow's Sam?
You know, he gets scared.
And you?
I'm fine.
Look...
that thing you had
to do to Sarah...
I know how that can
change people.
Dad...
don't worry about me.
I'm not Sam, and
I'm not Mom.
So...
you're not going to live with
us anymore... are you ?
I don't think it's a good
idea right now.
Then don't worry.
I'll take care of them.
Come here.
You are not me.
Thank you for helping me.
Just try to keep still.
It's my job, you know.
I didn't want to do it.
I had to.
We all have our jobs to do,
whether we want to do them or not.
Just hang on.
The bus is here.
When do you think you'll come back?
After this...
he's never going to
let me come back.
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought them here.
There were other places...
camps...
towns we heard about.
But I had to see you.
A refugee broke into the house.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'll get the guys.
Listen to me.
We can't let this happen.
We're ready.
Get up.
Wait, you can't take him.
Once my friends and I...
are safely out of town...
I'll let him go.
He'll be dead by then.
You can't let them go out there.
A woman died on Main Street today.
I didn't even know her name.
Did you?
If you need a hostage,
take me.
Think of our neighbors who
haven't made it back yet.
That's who they are.
Now my family can feed two people.
Now my family can feed two people.
Who else here is willing
to share their rations?
They're coming out!
All right, move back!
Move back!
Come on, people, we can do this.
I know we can, please.
Thank you, Bob. Yeah.
Right. Good.
Who else?
Come on, who else? Please.
Please.
Everybody, get back!
Get back!
Keep your guns down.
Keep them down.
Move back!
Move back!
- Move back!
- My God.
Roger...
it's over.
They can stay.
We found them homes.
Just put the gun down, Roger.
You won.
Come on, put it down.
How's the mayor?
Jessica did a great job.
He's, um...
he's lost a lot of blood,
but he's stable.
We talked him into letting
the others stay.
But, um...
Not me.
Well...
I'd say I'd call you, but...
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Roger, I-I am, so...
I did this
so the people I love
can be safe here.
I'm not taking the person I love
the most out on those roads.
I can handle it.
I can't.
So... what do you think?
Well, it's no Saks Fifth Avenue,
but...
it's pretty great.
Thanks to all the deals we made,
we have a real trading post now.
Hi, Mr. Simmons.
Hank.
- What?!
You think this is a joke?
I could've shot you.
Talk to your uncle, Hank.
He's the one that broke the deal.
You're just a real big man,
aren't you?
Just give me my horse
and the gas, and I'll be on my way.
The horse is tied up in the alley,
but the gas is mine.
I'm through playing
games with you.
Hank, get the gas.
Meet my new employees.
This is, um,
Jim and Judy Moore's house.
They were visiting their grandchildren
just outside of Philadelphia.
Rations are on Tuesday.
We'll be by to share them with you.
Mrs. Green.
Thank you.
We got together
some canned food and water.
I wish I had more.
Nothing I say is going to...
is going to sound right, so...
Are you really sad to see me go?
It's not about that.
Here.
Take Cedar Run first, it's clear,
and then head to New Bern.
Heather, Stanley, my brother,
they can help you
once you're there.
I know my way around.

Salut, Rob.
Quelqu'un de l'ťquipe

Tu sais trŤs bien qu'ils auraient dit
n'importe quoi pour te faire parler.
<i>"On se sert de sa famille."
Va chercher le paquet.
Durant ces 3 derniers mois,

«a vaut vraiment le coup
pour 6 gamins ?
6 gamins dans une salle de classe,
c'est pas Harvard, mais c'est un dťbut.
Je pensais pour toi.
Je pense qu'il est temps que certaines
choses reviennent ŗ la normale.
Pour Ítre honnÍte,
si j'ťtais un gamin...
aller ŗ l'ťcole ne serait pas vraiment
ma premiŤre prioritť en ce moment.
Salut, Jimmy.
Salut, tu aurais quelques instants,
j'ai besoin de ton aide.
Tu devrais te trouver un signal de
dťtresse, ou un truc de ce genre.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Tu te souviens, la semaine derniŤre,
ils ont dit ŗ la radio que les
terroristes avaient de fausses plaques
du FBI pour tromper la sťcuritť.
J'ai vu une de ces plaques.
Oý ?
Je n'ai jamais ťtudiť le droit,
mais laisse-moi deviner.
- Entrťe avec effraction ?
- C'est un cas probable.
C'est de la paranoÔa,
et un abus de pouvoir.
Allez, on repart... avant qu'il
ne rentre et te surprenne...
ŗ fouiner dans sa maison.
Les terroristes avaient
des badges du FBI...
Robert Hawkins a un
badge du FBI.
Tu crois aux coÔncidences ?
Il est peut-Ítre bien du FBI !
Tu y as pensť au moins ?
Oui...
et j'ai demandť ŗ sa famille.
Ils disent tous qu'il est du FBI.
Mais... en mÍme temps, leurs
regards me donnent l'impression...
qu'ils ne me disent pas tout.
Du mÍme genre que le regard
que j'ai en ce moment ?
…coute, j'avais comme un
pressentiment, et j'avais raison.
Pour l'instant, il est en patrouille
pour un bon moment, donc...
Viens !
Tu as forcť cette serrure ?
Ouais.
Et bien, c'est un peu bizarre,
mais...
s'il est du FBI,
sa cave peut bien ressembler ŗ Áa.
C'est aussi ce que
je me disais...
avant de voir Áa.
- Gray est au courant ?
- Non.
Je voulais un second avis
avant d'en parler ŗ qui que ce soit.
Alors, on fait quoi ?
N'y pense mÍme pas.

Sors-le.
Tout doucement.
Fais-le glisser.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous lŗ ?
C'est toi qui as dťtruit ces
23 villes amťricaines ?
- Sors de chez moi.
- Rťponds ŗ ma question !
- Qu'est-ce qui te fait penser Áa ?
- Tu as un groupe ťlectrogŤne...
et une rťserve de nourriture.
Comme si tu t'ťtais prťparť
ŗ ces attaques.
- Je vais te donner 10 secondes...
- Recule !
Jimmy sait que je suis lŗ.
Si je ne lui rťponds pas ŗ son retour,
tu devras affronter bien plus de gens.
Je suis un agent du FBI, Jake.
ņ ce qu'il paraÓt.
Le problŤme, c'est que les
terroristes ont utilisť
de faux badges du FBI pour
pouvoir placer leurs bombes.
C'est quoi cette piŤce ?
ņ quel point es-tu impliquť
dans tout Áa ?
Je dois savoir.
Il y a 5 mois, voici ŗ quoi
ressemblait notre pays.
Maintenant c'est de
l'histoire ancienne.
Ce n'est plus qu'une
reprťsentation de notre passť.
Maintenant...
voici notre seule certitude.
Nous devrons tout reconstruire
en partant de lŗ.
Mais comment faire ?
Comment ?
Observons notre histoire...
ťtudions nos ancÍtres.
- Il y aura d'autres profs ?
- Non.
Oý vas-tu ?
Ma mŤre est ŗ la maison...
elle cultive des betteraves dans la
baignoire pour nous nourrir.
Tout Áa...
c'est pas important.
La classe finira
tŰt aujourd'hui.
Tu peux partir aussi,
si tu veux.
Je ne suis pas forcťment la bienvenue
ŗ la maison en ce moment.
Donc, je pense que je
suis coincťe ici.
<i>Alors, nous y voilŗ...</i>
Je t'assure que Áa n'a
rien de personnel, je...
suis sŻre que tu es...
admirable.
Bon, je vais Ítre honnÍte avec toi.
C'est toi qui ponds le moins d'oeufs...
et je vous avais toutes averties
que cela arriverait.
Je pense avoir ťtť
tout ŗ fait claire sur ce point.
TrŤs bien.
Le truc c'est que...
si tu me connaissais,
tu saurais...
ŗ quel point tout
ceci est comique,
parce que
ce n'est vraiment pas mon truc.
Non... Áa, c'est un truc
pour Stanley.
C'est juste que...
j'ai horriblement faim.
Et... je ne vais pas te faire le coup
de la chaÓne alimentaire, mais...
je n'en peux plus de
manger des germes.
OK ? Assez parlť...
on y va...
Voilŗ mon problŤme...
Je sais comment tu risques
de rťagir ŗ Áa, et...
je sais que si tu te mets ŗ courir
partout sans ta tÍte, je vais flipper.
Alors si tu pouvais ťviter
de me faire ce genre de truc...
j'apprťcierais vraiment.
Bon, va pour les germes.
Tu cherches vraiment
des chevreuils ?
Ils sont pas tous partis ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, Harry ?
Tu penses venir ŗ la
mairie aujourd'hui ?
Gray est parti, et Áa serait bien
d'avoir quelqu'un de compťtent.
Ce n'est plus mon boulot, va-t'en.
J'essaye de chasser le chevreuil.
Ce serait juste pour
un jour ou deux.
Tu ressembles ŗ s'y mťprendre
ŗ un chevreuil, Harry.
J'ai fait partie du FBI
pendant 15 ans.
J'ai ťtudiť la loi aprŤs la fac,
puis j'ai rejoint le Bureau.
Dans quelle ťcole ?
Georgetown,
tu veux voir mon diplŰme ?
Et au FBI, sur quoi
tu travaillais ?
Je devais surveiller les
appels tťlťphoniques
passťs dans la rťgion vers une...
cellule terroriste supposťe.
- Et qu'as-tu trouvť ?
- Rien.
Fausse piste.
On en a fini ?
Loin de lŗ.
Parle-moi d'elle...
Sarah Mason.
Elle est partie.
T'as tout prťvu.
Je me suis aussi occupť
de celui du meuble,
et de celui qui est planquť
derriŤre le chauffe-eau.
Il n'y a qu'une seule arme
chargťe dans cette maison...
et c'est la mienne.
Assieds-toi.
Les mains derriŤre ton dos.
Parle-moi de Sarah.
Jimmy m'a dit qu'elle ťtait
aussi flic ŗ St Louis.
Elle travaillait avec toi ?
Contre toi ?
Qui sont ces gens ?
Tu fais une grave erreur.
- Je suis un officier fťdťral.
- Vraiment ?
Je suis sŻr que non.
Robert Willer...
dťpartement d'…tat.
Et aussi Robert Snyder...
Police de Colombus.
Commandant Robert Richmond...
Renseignements de la Marine.
Aucun d'entre eux n'est vrai...
tout comme ce badge.
Qui es-tu, bon sang ?
Pour qui tu travailles ?
Mieux vaut pour toi
ignorer ce que je sais.
- Je pense pouvoir le supporter.
- Vraiment ?
J'ai dťjŗ du mal moi-mÍme,
malgrť mon entraÓnement.
Tu veux me le dire ŗ moi...
ou ŗ toute la ville ?
TrŤs bien.
Mais une fois que tu
sauras tout...
tu feras partie de l'histoire, Jake,
et pas de marche arriŤre.
Pour qui tu travailles ?
CIA.
Sarah Mason et moi ťtions membres
d'un groupe non officiel.
On recherchait les bombes
utilisťes pour les attaques.
D'oý venaient-elles...
les bombes ?
Le gouvernement les a introduites.
AprŤs la chute de
l'Union Soviťtique...
les militaires au rencart, et les
pays satellites ont commencť
ŗ vendre leur stock d'armement
au marchť noir.
Alors la CIA a lancť
une opťration...
pour rťcupťrer ce matťriel par
tous les moyens possible.
Mais, il y a quelques annťes,
une cargaison a disparu avant
d'arriver au centre de stockage
de la Dťfense ŗ Oak Ridge.
Et c'est lŗ que mon ťquipe
est entrťe en jeu.
Pourquoi toi ?
Je suis le meilleur
dans ma spťcialitť.
Et qu'est-ce que c'est ?
La surveillance satellite.
J'ai rendez-vous ŗ 14 h
avec M. Higgins.
Je suis restťe ici toute la journťe.
Quel temps fait-il dehors ?
On dirait qu'il va pleuvoir.
Merci.
- Bonjour Victor.
- Hawkins.
Je pense que vous connaissez
tout le monde ici...
exceptť cette jeune femme.
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.
Bon, rentrons dans
le vif du sujet.
Il y a pas mal de travail
qui nous attend.
Comme beaucoup
d'entre vous le savent...
une cargaison nuclťaire du
projet RedBell a disparu.
Ce que vous ne savez pas...
c'est que, de source sŻre,
les tÍtes nuclťaires
ont ťtť transformťes
en 25 petites...
bombes ŗ haut rendement.
Ces bombes ont ťtť distribuťes
ŗ des cellules extrťmistes
actives au sein mÍme des …tats-Unis.
C'est Al Qaeda ?
J'aurais aimť que
ce soit si simple.
Mais c'est plus important que Áa.
C'est un mťlange de
milices internes...
d'anarchistes,
et de fanatiques religieux.
Comme vous pouvez le voir,
ces terroristes...
n'auraient jamais collaborť,
idťologiquement, ni politiquement.
La seule chose qui les lie,
est la volontť
de faire tomber le
gouvernement fťdťral.
Notre mission est d'infiltrer
ces cellules...
et de trouver les bombes.
Et qui est ŗ la tÍte de
cette organisation ?
L'Agence s'est penchťe de
prŤs sur cette question,
et tout ce que nous savons, c'est qu'il
dispose d'importantes ressources,
et les capacitťs pour coordonner
tous ces groupes.
Et d'aprŤs ce que l'on sait...
c'est un Amťricain.
<i>On a ťtť sťparťs
en groupe de deux.
Chaque unitť a ťtť chargťe
d'une cellule terroriste.
Un agent infiltrť,
l'autre servant d'agent de liaison.
Tu veux pas me faire avaler
que tu as ťtť envoyť ici...
sous couverture.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a
de spťcial ici ?
Tu sais,
je te montrerais bien, mais...
Bien essayť.
C'est lŗ-bas...
derriŤre la carte.
Oý as-tu eu Áa ?
La Dťfense travaille sur ces
simulations depuis les annťes 50.
Scťnarios de retombťes radioactives en
cas d'attaque sur 20 villes amťricaines.
Et tu vois Jericho ?
C'est en dehors des zones
de retombťes, Jake.
Il y a une mine de sel,
des terres agricoles,
et une nappe phrťatique intacte.
Rien ŗ voir avec les
appels tťlťphoniques ?
Jericho ťtait un point de ralliement
en cas d'ťchec de la mission.
…chec ?
Ou succŤs ?
Et Johnston...
il voulait venir, je le sais.
Il a un peu de mal ŗ gťrer
les ťvŤnements rťcemment.
Il est toujours trŤs calme...
quand il traverse une
ťpreuve, mais...
j'aimerais trouver les
mots justes
pour l'aider en ce moment.
Tu nous manques,
ma chťrie.
Il n'y a plus de germes.
Tu les as terminťs ?
J'avais faim.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici, Sean ?
Il est ŗ peine 9h30...
Oh, mon...
Tu as dormi ici ?
Et bien, en fait... je n'ai pas
vraiment beaucoup dormi.
Sors de cette maison !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Tu l'as laissť dormir ici ?
- Oui.
Stanley n'aurait sŻrement
pas acceptť Áa, hein ?
Stanley n'est pas lŗ.
Juste comme Áa...
Tu as infiltrť une cellule terroriste
qui prťparait une
attaque nuclťaire ?
Ouais...
Juste comme Áa.
«a m'a pris deux annťes.
J'ai passť 8 mois en prison...
ŗ crťer des contacts
pour infiltrer le rťseau.
Mon seul contact ŗ l'extťrieur
ťtait mon agent de liaison.
En sortant, j'ai passť un an
ŗ essayer de gagner
leur confiance.
Et mÍme ŗ ce moment,
je n'avais qu'effleurť la surface.
Mais tu y es arrivť.
Comment ?
Ils recherchaient de bonnes imitations
de badges gouvernementaux.
Tu leur as fourni les badges !
Je devais prouver ma loyautť et
mon utilitť pour la cellule, Jake.
- Je pense que j'en ai entendu assez.
- Non !
Tu n'en connais qu'un fragment.
Tu as voulu entendre tout ceci...
alors pourquoi n'ťcoutes-tu
pas jusqu'au bout ?
La cellule voulait des badges.
Et il fallait que je m'affirme
dans leur organisation.
Alors, j'ai laissť entendre que je
pourrais avoir un contact.
Les badges...
seraient marquťs pour que
mon ťquipe puisse les traquer.
Ils m'ont envoyť faire l'ťchange
avec un autre terroriste.
Le gamin s'appelait Daryl.
Comment savoir s'ils sont vrais ?
Ils le sont suffisamment.
Oý vous les avez eus ?
Comment j'ai obtenu ces badges...
c'est mes oignons.
Ce que vous en faites...
c'est les vŰtres.
- Ravi d'avoir fait affaire.
- Nous aussi.
On devrait fÍter Áa, mec.
Sortir, trouver des nanas.
«a a pas trop l'air d'Ítre ton genre.
Toujours sťrieux.
T'es mariť ?
Je l'ťtais.
Vraiment ?
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
On ne bouge plus !
Dťsolť, mec.
C'est pas vrai,
c'est une blague.
FBI !
Mains en l'air !
Tournez-vous contre la voiture.
<i>Il s'est avťrť que Daryl
ťtait un informateur du FBI.
<i>Mon agent a pu m'extraire,
et ma couverture est sauve.
Alors le FBI a une taupe
dans ma cellule terroriste,
et ils ne nous disent rien ?
J'ťtais ŗ deux doigts
d'Ítre dťmasquť.
- Vous Ítes toujours couvert, non ?
- On pense, oui.
Alors on continue.
Avez-vous pris contact avec
les coordinateurs des attaques ?
Non... mais je pense qu'on devrait
annihiler les cellules
qu'on a dťjŗ infiltrťes.
Si Áa n'interrompt pas leur plan,
Áa devrait le retarder pour...
Combien de bombes
pouvez-vous intercepter ?
1/3 sŻr...
La moitiť avec un peu de chance.
…coutez, je sais...
c'est pas l'idťal,
mais c'est notre meilleure solution.
«a fait toujours une douzaine
de bombes dans la nature.
- Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
- Je pense qu'il y a un moyen...
de continuer et d'intercepter
toutes les bombes.
- On avait dit que...
- Vous permettez ?
Il y a peut-Ítre un moyen
de gagner leur confiance.
Mon partenaire dit ŗ leur leader
que Daryl travaille pour le FBI.
On obtient ainsi la crťdibilitť requise
pour grimper les ťchelons.
Alors, on se charge du FBI...
et faites ce que vous pouvez
pour la pťrennitť de l'opťration.
«a prendra du temps,
mais on est prÍt du but.
On compte sur vous,
vous connaissez les risques.
J'espŤre que t'as fait le bon choix.
J'ai fait le bon choix.
Fais-moi confiance.
Qu'est-ce que t'aurais fait ?
Rester dans la course,
ou renoncer ?
C'est pas Áa le plus important.
Je me serais demandť ŗ quel point
je faisais confiance ŗ ma partenaire.
Si j'arrive ŗ m'approcher
sans que tu te retournes,
comment vas-tu chasser
quelque chose ?
Je t'ai entendue ŗ 3 km
avec ces chaussures.
Tu devais venir voir
April avec moi, aujourd'hui.
Bien.
Tu rentres dÓner ?
Il n'y a plus de chevreuils dans
ces bois, ils ont tous disparu.
Alors, je suppose que je
vais rester un bon moment.
J'ai jamais voulu Ítre mŤre.
J'ai pas demandť ŗ le devenir.
Mais tu sais quoi, t'as raison.
Je dois bien Áa ŗ Stanley.
Alors je vais me lancer...
les pieds dans le plat,
qu'elle le veuille ou non.
…coute-moi parler de mes problŤmes.
Tu dois avoir envie de prendre
cette hachette et te suicider.
Je savais pas qu'il connaissait
le langage des signes.
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a dit ?
Peu importe, ťcoute...
C'est pas une bonne frťquentation.
Je ne peux pas
t'empÍcher de le voir...
mais il n'est plus le bienvenu
dans cette maison, tu m'as comprise ?
Pourquoi tu ne te sens plus
la bienvenue chez toi ?
T'es pas obligťe de me rťpondre.
C'est pas que
je ne veux pas en parler.
C'est que...
ma famille est assez bizarre.
La mienne l'ťtait aussi.
En fait, ŗ ton ‚ge,
j'aimais pas rentrer chez moi non plus.
Et maintenant ?
Ils sont morts.
Il s'est passť quelque chose
chez moi...
il y a quelques semaines.
J'ai fait quelque chose.
Bien. Quoi exactement ?
Quelque chose...
d'impardonnable.
Et maintenant, ma mŤre...
me regarde de faÁon ťtrange.
Comme si j'ťtais devenue
une sorte de monstre.
Tu sais que c'est faux, hein ?
Donc, mÍme si t'ťtais pas sŻr du plan,
t'as vendu la taupe
au chef de la cellule.
Quand on a dťcidť
de ne pas intervenir,
c'ťtait ma seule chance
de pťnťtrer leur dťfense
et de gagner leur confiance.
J'ai dit au chef que
Daryl ťtait une taupe,
mais je voulais le sortir de lŗ
avant qu'ils ne le tuent.
Allez, prends ce dont t'as besoin
et on y va.
Ils vont me traquer, puis me tuer.
C'est ton jour de chance, Daryl.
T'auras droit ŗ la protection
des tťmoins, t'inquiŤte pas.
On va te sortir de lŗ.
Reste lŗ.
- Merde !
- Qui c'est ?
<i>Daryl, on veut simplement discuter.
Le chef de la cellule.
Faut que tu me sortes de lŗ.
Cours !
Je leur dirai que tu t'es enfui.
Je me suis cassť la jambe.
Je t'en prie, aide-moi !
Ou je leur dis
qui tu es vraiment.
Je suis dťsolť.
<i>C'est ainsi que
j'ai gagnť leur confiance.
<i>J'ťtais avec eux.
Tu l'as tuť.
Soit je le tuais...
ou des millions de gens mourraient.
Ils sont morts quand mÍme.
<i>T'es toujours en bas ?
Rťponds-lui.
C'est pas en me menaÁant
que tu vas me convaincre.
Ne m'oblige pas ŗ le tuer, Jake.
TrŤs bien.
TrŤs bien !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Jake ?
On a besoin
d'un peu de temps, c'est tout.
- T'es sŻr ?
- Ouais, tout va bien.
Je suis devant.
Tourne-toi, Jake.
Il n'est plus question
de Áa, dťsormais.
On a dťpassť ce stade.
ņ partir de maintenant,
on se fait confiance.
Tu dois tout me dire.
Assez discutť.
Passons aux choses sťrieuses.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais lŗ ?
C'est ton premier jour
dans ta nouvelle ťcole.
La derniŤre fois que Áa t'est arrivť,
Sam portait des couches.
On dirait qu'il n'y avait pas
grand monde.
Ils sont partis tŰt.
Je te croyais plus douťe.
Je me suis dit que t'ťtais pas pressťe
que je rentre de toute faÁon.
Pourquoi tu dis Áa ?
Tu sais...
ŗ cause de ce que j'ai fait.
Allison, je t'aime.
D'accord ?
Rien ne changera Áa.
Tu m'entends, chťrie ?
Rien ne changera Áa.
Ma petite puce.
Maman, je t'en prie,
ne m'en veux pas.
Je suis navrťe, M'man.
- Y a un truc que je comprends pas.
- Quoi ?
Si tu dis la vťritť,
tu as rťussi.
Tu as pťnťtrť leur dťfense,
tu as gagnť leur confiance.
Bien.
Que s'est-il passť ensuite ?
Quelqu'un a renseignť
les terroristes, Jake.
Avant que l'on ne dťcouvre qui...
<i>les terroristes ont modifiť leur plan.
Victor ?
On a fait une erreur,
<i>une grave erreur.</i>
<i>Voici le moment tant attendu.
Les attaques dťbuteront demain,
ŗ 8h05, heure de New York.
OK. Non... …coutez !
Les camions...
ils sont blancs.
Immatriculťs au Kansas,
5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...
<i>J'ai essayť de prťvenir l'agence...
<i>mais c'ťtait trop tard.
Certaines bombes ťtaient
en route pour New York.
On a rťussi ŗ les intercepter.
MÍme aprŤs 4 ans de travail...
on a pas pu toutes les rťcupťrer.
<i>Je vais devoir faire avec
jusqu'ŗ la fin de mes jours.
Depuis quand es-tu drŰle ?
Je l'ai toujours ťtť.
Ouais, mais jamais trŤs longtemps.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Rob ?
Je fais vite.
Je dťrange pas, si ?
Faites pas l'innocent.
Vous ne rťpondiez pas ŗ nos appels.
J'ai dit ŗ ma femme
que j'en avais fini.
Je lui ai promis, Victor.
- On a besoin de vous.
- Pourquoi moi ?
Vous Ítes le meilleur dans votre boulot.
C'est ŗ dire ?
Votre famille sera lŗ,
quand vous rentrerez.
L'ťquipe se retrouve demain.
Venez ťcouter de quoi Áa parle.
Si vous voulez partir...
vous partirez.
14 heures,
demain.
Dites ŗ la rťceptionniste que
vous avez RDV avec M. Higgins.
Si elle vous parle du temps...
dites-lui qu'il va pleuvoir.
C'ťtait qui ?
Il se pourrait que
j'aille ŗ une rťunion demain.
Je ne veux pas recommencer.
Tout ira bien, D.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Le fond du terrier, Jake !
Donne-moi un coup de main.
C'est lourd !
Tu me crois maintenant ?
C'est bien ce que je crois ?
Prťvue pour Columbus, Ohio.
Tu as ramenť
une bombe nuclťaire... ici.
T'en aurais fait quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu vas en faire ?
La garder en sťcuritť.
Je vais la garder secrŤte.
Parce que...
«a rend la ville plus puissante, Jake,
mais Áa en fait ťgalement une cible.
…coute...
Je sais ce que tu penses...
Que t'aurais dŻ filer quand
je t'en ai donnť l'occasion, non ?
Pourquoi tu m'as pas montrť Áa
quand je suis arrivť ?
Tu ťtais lŗ avant moi !
Je t'ai observť, Jake...
tu sais te contrŰler.
J'ai vu ŗ quel point
tu avais aidť cette ville.
Je devais savoir si
je pouvais te faire confiance.
 tre sŻr que tu ne paniquerais
pas si je te disais tout.
Cette bombe...
c'est notre fardeau,
maintenant.
Qu'importe ce qu'il arrive...
Áa dťpend de toi.
Il est du FBI.
Comme il l'a dit.
Mais...
On est entre de bonnes mains.
C'est bon ŗ entendre.
Dťsolť pour tout Áa, M. Hawkins.
Normalement, on fait Áa dehors.
Je ne savais pas.
Il y a quelque chose
que j'aimerais te dire.
J'apprends...
alors sois indulgente.
Stanley... est...
important... pour moi.
Tu... es... importante... pour moi.
Je... veux... que tu...
sois en sťcuritť.
Alors, je t'en prie...
sois patiente... avec moi.
J'essaie...
Je vais essayer aussi.
Alors...
c‚lin ?
C'est vrai.
Je t'ai apportť ŗ manger.
Merci.

«a vaut vraiment le coup
pour 6 gamins ?
6 gamins dans une salle de classe,
c'est pas Harvard, mais c'est un dťbut.
Je pensais pour toi.
Je pense qu'il est temps que certaines
choses reviennent ŗ la normale.
Pour Ítre honnÍte,
si j'ťtais un gamin...
aller ŗ l'ťcole ne serait pas vraiment
ma premiŤre prioritť en ce moment.
Salut, Jimmy.
Salut, tu aurais quelques instants,
j'ai besoin de ton aide.
Tu devrais te trouver un signal de
dťtresse, ou un truc de ce genre.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Tu te souviens, la semaine derniŤre,
ils ont dit ŗ la radio que les
terroristes avaient de fausses plaques
du FBI pour tromper la sťcuritť.
J'ai vu une de ces plaques.
Oý ?
Je n'ai jamais ťtudiť le droit,
mais laisse-moi deviner.
- Entrťe avec effraction ?
- C'est un cas probable.
C'est de la paranoÔa,
et un abus de pouvoir.
Allez, on repart... avant qu'il
ne rentre et te surprenne...
ŗ fouiner dans sa maison.
Les terroristes avaient
des badges du FBI...
Robert Hawkins a un
badge du FBI.
Tu crois aux coÔncidences ?
Il est peut-Ítre bien du FBI !
Tu y as pensť au moins ?
Oui...
et j'ai demandť ŗ sa famille.
Ils disent tous qu'il est du FBI.
Mais... en mÍme temps, leurs
regards me donnent l'impression...
qu'ils ne me disent pas tout.
Du mÍme genre que le regard
que j'ai en ce moment ?
…coute, j'avais comme un
pressentiment, et j'avais raison.
Pour l'instant, il est en patrouille
pour un bon moment, donc...
Viens !
Tu as forcť cette serrure ?
Ouais.
Et bien, c'est un peu bizarre,
mais...
s'il est du FBI,
sa cave peut bien ressembler ŗ Áa.
C'est aussi ce que
je me disais...
avant de voir Áa.
- Gray est au courant ?
- Non.
Je voulais un second avis
avant d'en parler ŗ qui que ce soit.
Alors, on fait quoi ?
N'y pense mÍme pas.

Sors-le.
Tout doucement.
Fais-le glisser.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous lŗ ?
C'est toi qui as dťtruit ces
23 villes amťricaines ?
- Sors de chez moi.
- Rťponds ŗ ma question !
- Qu'est-ce qui te fait penser Áa ?
- Tu as un groupe ťlectrogŤne...
et une rťserve de nourriture.
Comme si tu t'ťtais prťparť
ŗ ces attaques.
- Je vais te donner 10 secondes...
- Recule !
Jimmy sait que je suis lŗ.
Si je ne lui rťponds pas ŗ son retour,
tu devras affronter bien plus de gens.
Je suis un agent du FBI, Jake.
ņ ce qu'il paraÓt.
Le problŤme, c'est que les
terroristes ont utilisť
de faux badges du FBI pour
pouvoir placer leurs bombes.
C'est quoi cette piŤce ?
ņ quel point es-tu impliquť
dans tout Áa ?
Je dois savoir.
Il y a 5 mois, voici ŗ quoi
ressemblait notre pays.
Maintenant c'est de
l'histoire ancienne.
Ce n'est plus qu'une
reprťsentation de notre passť.
Maintenant...
voici notre seule certitude.
Nous devrons tout reconstruire
en partant de lŗ.
Mais comment faire ?
Comment ?
Observons notre histoire...
ťtudions nos ancÍtres.
- Il y aura d'autres profs ?
- Non.
Oý vas-tu ?
Ma mŤre est ŗ la maison...
elle cultive des betteraves dans la
baignoire pour nous nourrir.
Tout Áa...
c'est pas important.
La classe finira
tŰt aujourd'hui.
Tu peux partir aussi,
si tu veux.
Je ne suis pas forcťment la bienvenue
ŗ la maison en ce moment.
Donc, je pense que je
suis coincťe ici.
<i>Alors, nous y voilŗ...</i>
Je t'assure que Áa n'a
rien de personnel, je...
suis sŻre que tu es...
admirable.
Bon, je vais Ítre honnÍte avec toi.
C'est toi qui ponds le moins d'oeufs...
et je vous avais toutes averties
que cela arriverait.
Je pense avoir ťtť
tout ŗ fait claire sur ce point.
TrŤs bien.
Le truc c'est que...
si tu me connaissais,
tu saurais...
ŗ quel point tout
ceci est comique,
parce que
ce n'est vraiment pas mon truc.
Non... Áa, c'est un truc
pour Stanley.
C'est juste que...
j'ai horriblement faim.
Et... je ne vais pas te faire le coup
de la chaÓne alimentaire, mais...
je n'en peux plus de
manger des germes.
OK ? Assez parlť...
on y va...
Voilŗ mon problŤme...
Je sais comment tu risques
de rťagir ŗ Áa, et...
je sais que si tu te mets ŗ courir
partout sans ta tÍte, je vais flipper.
Alors si tu pouvais ťviter
de me faire ce genre de truc...
j'apprťcierais vraiment.
Bon, va pour les germes.
Tu cherches vraiment
des chevreuils ?
Ils sont pas tous partis ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, Harry ?
Tu penses venir ŗ la
mairie aujourd'hui ?
Gray est parti, et Áa serait bien
d'avoir quelqu'un de compťtent.
Ce n'est plus mon boulot, va-t'en.
J'essaye de chasser le chevreuil.
Ce serait juste pour
un jour ou deux.
Tu ressembles ŗ s'y mťprendre
ŗ un chevreuil, Harry.
J'ai fait partie du FBI
pendant 15 ans.
J'ai ťtudiť la loi aprŤs la fac,
puis j'ai rejoint le Bureau.
Dans quelle ťcole ?
Georgetown,
tu veux voir mon diplŰme ?
Et au FBI, sur quoi
tu travaillais ?
Je devais surveiller les
appels tťlťphoniques
passťs dans la rťgion vers une...
cellule terroriste supposťe.
- Et qu'as-tu trouvť ?
- Rien.
Fausse piste.
On en a fini ?
Loin de lŗ.
Parle-moi d'elle...
Sarah Mason.
Elle est partie.
T'as tout prťvu.
Je me suis aussi occupť
de celui du meuble,
et de celui qui est planquť
derriŤre le chauffe-eau.
Il n'y a qu'une seule arme
chargťe dans cette maison...
et c'est la mienne.
Assieds-toi.
Les mains derriŤre ton dos.
Parle-moi de Sarah.
Jimmy m'a dit qu'elle ťtait
aussi flic ŗ St Louis.
Elle travaillait avec toi ?
Contre toi ?
Qui sont ces gens ?
Tu fais une grave erreur.
- Je suis un officier fťdťral.
- Vraiment ?
Je suis sŻr que non.
Robert Willer...
dťpartement d'…tat.
Et aussi Robert Snyder...
Police de Colombus.
Commandant Robert Richmond...
Renseignements de la Marine.
Aucun d'entre eux n'est vrai...
tout comme ce badge.
Qui es-tu, bon sang ?
Pour qui tu travailles ?
Mieux vaut pour toi
ignorer ce que je sais.
- Je pense pouvoir le supporter.
- Vraiment ?
J'ai dťjŗ du mal moi-mÍme,
malgrť mon entraÓnement.
Tu veux me le dire ŗ moi...
ou ŗ toute la ville ?
TrŤs bien.
Mais une fois que tu
sauras tout...
tu feras partie de l'histoire, Jake,
et pas de marche arriŤre.
Pour qui tu travailles ?
CIA.
Sarah Mason et moi ťtions membres
d'un groupe non officiel.
On recherchait les bombes
utilisťes pour les attaques.
D'oý venaient-elles...
les bombes ?
Le gouvernement les a introduites.
AprŤs la chute de
l'Union Soviťtique...
les militaires au rencart, et les
pays satellites ont commencť
ŗ vendre leur stock d'armement
au marchť noir.
Alors la CIA a lancť
une opťration...
pour rťcupťrer ce matťriel par
tous les moyens possible.
Mais, il y a quelques annťes,
une cargaison a disparu avant
d'arriver au centre de stockage
de la Dťfense ŗ Oak Ridge.
Et c'est lŗ que mon ťquipe
est entrťe en jeu.
Pourquoi toi ?
Je suis le meilleur
dans ma spťcialitť.
Et qu'est-ce que c'est ?
La surveillance satellite.
J'ai rendez-vous ŗ 14 h
avec M. Higgins.
Je suis restťe ici toute la journťe.
Quel temps fait-il dehors ?
On dirait qu'il va pleuvoir.
Merci.
- Bonjour Victor.
- Hawkins.
Je pense que vous connaissez
tout le monde ici...
exceptť cette jeune femme.
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.
Bon, rentrons dans
le vif du sujet.
Il y a pas mal de travail
qui nous attend.
Comme beaucoup
d'entre vous le savent...
une cargaison nuclťaire du
projet RedBell a disparu.
Ce que vous ne savez pas...
c'est que, de source sŻre,
les tÍtes nuclťaires
ont ťtť transformťes
en 25 petites...
bombes ŗ haut rendement.
Ces bombes ont ťtť distribuťes
ŗ des cellules extrťmistes
actives au sein mÍme des …tats-Unis.
C'est Al Qaeda ?
J'aurais aimť que
ce soit si simple.
Mais c'est plus important que Áa.
C'est un mťlange de
milices internes...
d'anarchistes,
et de fanatiques religieux.
Comme vous pouvez le voir,
ces terroristes...
n'auraient jamais collaborť,
idťologiquement, ni politiquement.
La seule chose qui les lie,
est la volontť
de faire tomber le
gouvernement fťdťral.
Notre mission est d'infiltrer
ces cellules...
et de trouver les bombes.
Et qui est ŗ la tÍte de
cette organisation ?
L'Agence s'est penchťe de
prŤs sur cette question,
et tout ce que nous savons, c'est qu'il
dispose d'importantes ressources,
et les capacitťs pour coordonner
tous ces groupes.
Et d'aprŤs ce que l'on sait...
c'est un Amťricain.
<i>On a ťtť sťparťs
en groupe de deux.
Chaque unitť a ťtť chargťe
d'une cellule terroriste.
Un agent infiltrť,
l'autre servant d'agent de liaison.
Tu veux pas me faire avaler
que tu as ťtť envoyť ici...
sous couverture.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a
de spťcial ici ?
Tu sais,
je te montrerais bien, mais...
Bien essayť.
C'est lŗ-bas...
derriŤre la carte.
Oý as-tu eu Áa ?
La Dťfense travaille sur ces
simulations depuis les annťes 50.
Scťnarios de retombťes radioactives en
cas d'attaque sur 20 villes amťricaines.
Et tu vois Jericho ?
C'est en dehors des zones
de retombťes, Jake.
Il y a une mine de sel,
des terres agricoles,
et une nappe phrťatique intacte.
Rien ŗ voir avec les
appels tťlťphoniques ?
Jericho ťtait un point de ralliement
en cas d'ťchec de la mission.
…chec ?
Ou succŤs ?
Et Johnston...
il voulait venir, je le sais.
Il a un peu de mal ŗ gťrer
les ťvŤnements rťcemment.
Il est toujours trŤs calme...
quand il traverse une
ťpreuve, mais...
j'aimerais trouver les
mots justes
pour l'aider en ce moment.
Tu nous manques,
ma chťrie.
Il n'y a plus de germes.
Tu les as terminťs ?
J'avais faim.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici, Sean ?
Il est ŗ peine 9h30...
Oh, mon...
Tu as dormi ici ?
Et bien, en fait... je n'ai pas
vraiment beaucoup dormi.
Sors de cette maison !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Tu l'as laissť dormir ici ?
- Oui.
Stanley n'aurait sŻrement
pas acceptť Áa, hein ?
Stanley n'est pas lŗ.
Juste comme Áa...
Tu as infiltrť une cellule terroriste
qui prťparait une
attaque nuclťaire ?
Ouais...
Juste comme Áa.
«a m'a pris deux annťes.
J'ai passť 8 mois en prison...
ŗ crťer des contacts
pour infiltrer le rťseau.
Mon seul contact ŗ l'extťrieur
ťtait mon agent de liaison.
En sortant, j'ai passť un an
ŗ essayer de gagner
leur confiance.
Et mÍme ŗ ce moment,
je n'avais qu'effleurť la surface.
Mais tu y es arrivť.
Comment ?
Ils recherchaient de bonnes imitations
de badges gouvernementaux.
Tu leur as fourni les badges !
Je devais prouver ma loyautť et
mon utilitť pour la cellule, Jake.
- Je pense que j'en ai entendu assez.
- Non !
Tu n'en connais qu'un fragment.
Tu as voulu entendre tout ceci...
alors pourquoi n'ťcoutes-tu
pas jusqu'au bout ?
La cellule voulait des badges.
Et il fallait que je m'affirme
dans leur organisation.
Alors, j'ai laissť entendre que je
pourrais avoir un contact.
Les badges...
seraient marquťs pour que
mon ťquipe puisse les traquer.
Ils m'ont envoyť faire l'ťchange
avec un autre terroriste.
Le gamin s'appelait Daryl.
Comment savoir s'ils sont vrais ?
Ils le sont suffisamment.
Oý vous les avez eus ?
Comment j'ai obtenu ces badges...
c'est mes oignons.
Ce que vous en faites...
c'est les vŰtres.
- Ravi d'avoir fait affaire.
- Nous aussi.
On devrait fÍter Áa, mec.
Sortir, trouver des nanas.
«a a pas trop l'air d'Ítre ton genre.
Toujours sťrieux.
T'es mariť ?
Je l'ťtais.
Vraiment ?
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
On ne bouge plus !
Dťsolť, mec.
C'est pas vrai,
c'est une blague.
FBI !
Mains en l'air !
Tournez-vous contre la voiture.
<i>Il s'est avťrť que Daryl
ťtait un informateur du FBI.
<i>Mon agent a pu m'extraire,
et ma couverture est sauve.
Alors le FBI a une taupe
dans ma cellule terroriste,
et ils ne nous disent rien ?
J'ťtais ŗ deux doigts
d'Ítre dťmasquť.
- Vous Ítes toujours couvert, non ?
- On pense, oui.
Alors on continue.
Avez-vous pris contact avec
les coordinateurs des attaques ?
Non... mais je pense qu'on devrait
annihiler les cellules
qu'on a dťjŗ infiltrťes.
Si Áa n'interrompt pas leur plan,
Áa devrait le retarder pour...
Combien de bombes
pouvez-vous intercepter ?
1/3 sŻr...
La moitiť avec un peu de chance.
…coutez, je sais...
c'est pas l'idťal,
mais c'est notre meilleure solution.
«a fait toujours une douzaine
de bombes dans la nature.
- Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
- Je pense qu'il y a un moyen...
de continuer et d'intercepter
toutes les bombes.
- On avait dit que...
- Vous permettez ?
Il y a peut-Ítre un moyen
de gagner leur confiance.
Mon partenaire dit ŗ leur leader
que Daryl travaille pour le FBI.
On obtient ainsi la crťdibilitť requise
pour grimper les ťchelons.
Alors, on se charge du FBI...
et faites ce que vous pouvez
pour la pťrennitť de l'opťration.
«a prendra du temps,
mais on est prÍt du but.
On compte sur vous,
vous connaissez les risques.
J'espŤre que t'as fait le bon choix.
J'ai fait le bon choix.
Fais-moi confiance.
Qu'est-ce que t'aurais fait ?
Rester dans la course,
ou renoncer ?
C'est pas Áa le plus important.
Je me serais demandť ŗ quel point
je faisais confiance ŗ ma partenaire.
Si j'arrive ŗ m'approcher
sans que tu te retournes,
comment vas-tu chasser
quelque chose ?
Je t'ai entendue ŗ 3 km
avec ces chaussures.
Tu devais venir voir
April avec moi, aujourd'hui.
Bien.
Tu rentres dÓner ?
Il n'y a plus de chevreuils dans
ces bois, ils ont tous disparu.
Alors, je suppose que je
vais rester un bon moment.
J'ai jamais voulu Ítre mŤre.
J'ai pas demandť ŗ le devenir.
Mais tu sais quoi, t'as raison.
Je dois bien Áa ŗ Stanley.
Alors je vais me lancer...
les pieds dans le plat,
qu'elle le veuille ou non.
…coute-moi parler de mes problŤmes.
Tu dois avoir envie de prendre
cette hachette et te suicider.
Je savais pas qu'il connaissait
le langage des signes.
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a dit ?
Peu importe, ťcoute...
C'est pas une bonne frťquentation.
Je ne peux pas
t'empÍcher de le voir...
mais il n'est plus le bienvenu
dans cette maison, tu m'as comprise ?
Pourquoi tu ne te sens plus
la bienvenue chez toi ?
T'es pas obligťe de me rťpondre.
C'est pas que
je ne veux pas en parler.
C'est que...
ma famille est assez bizarre.
La mienne l'ťtait aussi.
En fait, ŗ ton ‚ge,
j'aimais pas rentrer chez moi non plus.
Et maintenant ?
Ils sont morts.
Il s'est passť quelque chose
chez moi...
il y a quelques semaines.
J'ai fait quelque chose.
Bien. Quoi exactement ?
Quelque chose...
d'impardonnable.
Et maintenant, ma mŤre...
me regarde de faÁon ťtrange.
Comme si j'ťtais devenue
une sorte de monstre.
Tu sais que c'est faux, hein ?
Donc, mÍme si t'ťtais pas sŻr du plan,
t'as vendu la taupe
au chef de la cellule.
Quand on a dťcidť
de ne pas intervenir,
c'ťtait ma seule chance
de pťnťtrer leur dťfense
et de gagner leur confiance.
J'ai dit au chef que
Daryl ťtait une taupe,
mais je voulais le sortir de lŗ
avant qu'ils ne le tuent.
Allez, prends ce dont t'as besoin
et on y va.
Ils vont me traquer, puis me tuer.
C'est ton jour de chance, Daryl.
T'auras droit ŗ la protection
des tťmoins, t'inquiŤte pas.
On va te sortir de lŗ.
Reste lŗ.
- Merde !
- Qui c'est ?
<i>Daryl, on veut simplement discuter.
Le chef de la cellule.
Faut que tu me sortes de lŗ.
Cours !
Je leur dirai que tu t'es enfui.
Je me suis cassť la jambe.
Je t'en prie, aide-moi !
Ou je leur dis
qui tu es vraiment.
Je suis dťsolť.
<i>C'est ainsi que
j'ai gagnť leur confiance.
<i>J'ťtais avec eux.
Tu l'as tuť.
Soit je le tuais...
ou des millions de gens mourraient.
Ils sont morts quand mÍme.
<i>T'es toujours en bas ?
Rťponds-lui.
C'est pas en me menaÁant
que tu vas me convaincre.
Ne m'oblige pas ŗ le tuer, Jake.
TrŤs bien.
TrŤs bien !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Jake ?
On a besoin
d'un peu de temps, c'est tout.
- T'es sŻr ?
- Ouais, tout va bien.
Je suis devant.
Tourne-toi, Jake.
Il n'est plus question
de Áa, dťsormais.
On a dťpassť ce stade.
ņ partir de maintenant,
on se fait confiance.
Tu dois tout me dire.
Assez discutť.
Passons aux choses sťrieuses.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais lŗ ?
C'est ton premier jour
dans ta nouvelle ťcole.
La derniŤre fois que Áa t'est arrivť,
Sam portait des couches.
On dirait qu'il n'y avait pas
grand monde.
Ils sont partis tŰt.
Je te croyais plus douťe.
Je me suis dit que t'ťtais pas pressťe
que je rentre de toute faÁon.
Pourquoi tu dis Áa ?
Tu sais...
ŗ cause de ce que j'ai fait.
Allison, je t'aime.
D'accord ?
Rien ne changera Áa.
Tu m'entends, chťrie ?
Rien ne changera Áa.
Ma petite puce.
Maman, je t'en prie,
ne m'en veux pas.
Je suis navrťe, M'man.
- Y a un truc que je comprends pas.
- Quoi ?
Si tu dis la vťritť,
tu as rťussi.
Tu as pťnťtrť leur dťfense,
tu as gagnť leur confiance.
Bien.
Que s'est-il passť ensuite ?
Quelqu'un a renseignť
les terroristes, Jake.
Avant que l'on ne dťcouvre qui...
<i>les terroristes ont modifiť leur plan.
Victor ?
On a fait une erreur,
<i>une grave erreur.</i>
<i>Voici le moment tant attendu.
Les attaques dťbuteront demain,
ŗ 8h05, heure de New York.
OK. Non... …coutez !
Les camions...
ils sont blancs.
Immatriculťs au Kansas,
5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...
<i>J'ai essayť de prťvenir l'agence...
<i>mais c'ťtait trop tard.
Certaines bombes ťtaient
en route pour New York.
On a rťussi ŗ les intercepter.
MÍme aprŤs 4 ans de travail...
on a pas pu toutes les rťcupťrer.
<i>Je vais devoir faire avec
jusqu'ŗ la fin de mes jours.
Depuis quand es-tu drŰle ?
Je l'ai toujours ťtť.
Ouais, mais jamais trŤs longtemps.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Rob ?
Je fais vite.
Je dťrange pas, si ?
Faites pas l'innocent.
Vous ne rťpondiez pas ŗ nos appels.
J'ai dit ŗ ma femme
que j'en avais fini.
Je lui ai promis, Victor.
- On a besoin de vous.
- Pourquoi moi ?
Vous Ítes le meilleur dans votre boulot.
C'est ŗ dire ?
Votre famille sera lŗ,
quand vous rentrerez.
L'ťquipe se retrouve demain.
Venez ťcouter de quoi Áa parle.
Si vous voulez partir...
vous partirez.
14 heures,
demain.
Dites ŗ la rťceptionniste que
vous avez RDV avec M. Higgins.
Si elle vous parle du temps...
dites-lui qu'il va pleuvoir.
C'ťtait qui ?
Il se pourrait que
j'aille ŗ une rťunion demain.
Je ne veux pas recommencer.
Tout ira bien, D.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Le fond du terrier, Jake !
Donne-moi un coup de main.
C'est lourd !
Tu me crois maintenant ?
C'est bien ce que je crois ?
Prťvue pour Columbus, Ohio.
Tu as ramenť
une bombe nuclťaire... ici.
T'en aurais fait quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu vas en faire ?

Pourquoi tu m'as pas montrť Áa

Tu ťtais lŗ avant moi !
Je t'ai observť, Jake...

Hello, Rob.
Someone on my team
sold us all out.
You’re smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.
Get the package.
In the last three months,
I remembered
all the reasons...
why I needed you in my life.
So have I.
I've also remembered
why it can never work.
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
<i>We have also received reports
<i>that the bombers gained
the trust of local officials
<i>which allowed the terrorists
access to secure locations.
I’ve heard that voice before.
- That's the guy that does the
farm report.  - It’s real news.
<i>In New York, the terrorists
who were apprehended,
<i>were all carrying nearly perfect
fake FBI badges.
<i>- You're drunk.
- Yes, I am, Darcy.
<i>Yes, I am.
<i>What ?
What is it, Rob ?
Is all that really
worth it for 6 kids ?
Six kids in a conference room
is not Harvard, but it's a start.
I meant for you.
I think it's time we start trying
to get things back to normal.
To be honest with you,
if I'm a kid...
going to school isn't exactly high
on my list of priorities these days.
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, can I... borrow you for a few
minutes, I need your help.
I'm going to get you
a bat signal or something.
What's wrong ?
You remember, last week on the
radio broadcast, they said that
terrorists used fake FBI badges
to move through security ?
I've seen one of those badges.
Where ?
I never went to Law school,
but I'm going to go ahead and guess.
- This is breaking and entering.
- It's called probable cause.
It's called paranoďd
abuse of authority.
Come on, let's go... before he
comes home and catches you...
prying up his floorboards.
The terrorists had FBI badges...
Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge.
You think that's just coďncidence ?
Maybe he's FBI !
Please, tell me you thought of that.
I did...
and I asked his family.
And they all say he's FBI.
But... when they said it they all
had this look on their face like...
there was something that
they weren't saying.
Sort of like the look I've got
on my face right now.
Look, I had a hunch,
and I was right.
Now, he's out on patrol...
he's not going to be back
for a while, so...
Come on !
Did you bust this lock open ?
You know, this is kinda
weird, but...
if he's FBI, isn't this what
his basement would look like ?
That's... that's what I said...
until I saw this.
- Does Gray know about this ?
- No.
I wanted to get a second opinion
before I told anyone.
What do you want to do ?
Don't.
Who are you ?

Hand it over.
Nice and slow.
Slide it over.
What the hell are
you doing here ?
Did you wipe out 23
American cities ?
- Get out of my house.
- Answer the question !
- Why would you even think that ?
- You've got a working generator...
and a food supply.
So like you knew the
attacks were coming.
- I'm gonna give you 10 seconds...
- Back up !
Jimmy knows I'm here.
If I don't call him off
when he gets back...
you're gonna have a lot more
people than me to deal with.
I'm an FBI agent, Jake.
That's what I heard.
Problem is the radio was reporting
the terrorists used
forged FBI badges to get
their bombs into position.
What is that room ?
How were you involved
in all of this ?
I need to know.
5 months ago, this was
a map of our country.
Now, it's an antique.
It's a picture of the way
things used to be.
Right now...
all we're sure of is this.
But this is where we
start to rebuild.
So how do we do it ?
How ?
We look to our history.
We study the people
that came before us.
- Are you going to take attendance ?
- No.
Where are you going ?
My mom's at home right now...
trying to grow beets out of our
bathtub so we can eat newt month.
This stuff...
isn't important.
I guess school's out
early today.
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.
I don't think I should be hanging
around at home right now.
So, I guess I'm stuck here.
<i>So it's come to this...
I want you to know this has nothing
to do with you personnally, I'm...
sure you're...
wonderfull.
But let's be honest here, you're
the one that lays the fewest eggs
and I distinctly told all of you
that this was going to happen.
I believe I made myself perfectly
clear in that regard.
All right.
The thing is...
If you knew me at all,
you would...
see how really funny this is,
because this is so not my thing.
No... this is Stanley's thing.
It's just... I'm awfully hungry.
And... I don't want to get into the
whole circle of life business, but...
I just cannot eat anymore sprouts.
OK ? Enough stalling...
Here we go...
Here's my concern...
I've heard stories about how you're
gonna react to this, and
if I see half of you running around,
well I just know I'm gonna freak out.
So if you could do your best
to minimize that part of it...
I'd just really appreciate it.
Sprouts it is.
You really out here
looking for deer?
Thought they were all gone.
What do you want Harry ?
Do you think you could come
into city hall today ?
Gray’s still out, and
it’d be nice to have...
somebody around who knows
what they're doing.
Not my job anymore, and get lost,
I'm trying to shoot some deer.
Just be for a day or two.
You're starting to look an
awful lot like a deer, Harry.
I've been in the FBI
for 15 years.
I worked law enforcement after college,
and then I joined the bureau.
Where did you go to school ?
Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ?
The FBI, what were
you working on ?
I was sent here to monitor
the phone calls
made in the area to a...
suspected terrorist cell.
- And what did you find out ?
- Nothing.
Trail went dead.
We about done here ?
Not even close.
Tell me about her...
Sarah Mason.
She's gone.
You're pretty thorough.
Also took care of the one
in the cabinet
and the one behind
the water heater.
There's only one loaded
gun in this house...
and it's mine.
Sit down.
Arms behind you.
Tell me about Sarah.
Jimmy said she was also
a cop in St Louis.
She's working with you ?
Against you ?
Who are these people ?
You are making a serious mistake.
- I am a Federal Officer.
- Really ?
Really sure you're not.
Robert Willer...
State Department.
How about Robert Snyder...
Colombus PD ?
Commander Robert Richmond...
Naval Intelligence.
None of those are real...
and neither is that badge.
Who the hell are you ?
Who do you you work for ?
You do not wanna know
what I know.
- I think I can handle it.
- Really ?
Cause I can barely handle it,
and I was trained for this.
You want to tell me...
or you tell the whole town.
All right.
But once you hear this...
You are a part of it, Jake,
and there is no going back.
Who do you work for ?
CIA.
Sarah Mason and I were part of
an off-the-books team.
We were tracking the bombs
used in the attack.
Where did they come from...
the bombs ?
The US government
brought them in.
See, after the Soviet Union fell...
neglected military in the
satellite republics started
selling their nuclear stockpiles
on the black market.
So the CIA started
an operation...
get that material by any
and all means necessary.
But a few years ago, a shipment
disappeared on its way
to the DOE storage complex
in Oak Ridge.
And that is where my
CIA team came in.
Why you ?
I'm the best at what I do.
And what is that ?
Satellite installation.
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
with Mr. Higgins.
I've been inside all day.
How's the weather out there ?
You know, it looks like rain.
Thank you.
- Hello Victor.
- Hawkins.
I believe you know
everyone here...
except this young lady.
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.
All right, let's get down to it.
We have a lot of
ground to cover.
As most of you know...
a shipment of nukes from
project Red Bell is missing.
What you don't know...
is that we have quality intel
that those warheads...
have been converted
into 25 small...
high yield devices.
These bombs have been
dissiminated to extremists cells
active within the United States.
So, is this Al Qaeda ?
I wish it were that simple.
It's much larger than that.
It's a cross section of
domestic militias...
anarchists,
and religious fanatics.
As you can see,
these are terrorists...
that would never collaborate,
ideologically or politically.
The only thing that links
them, is the desire
to take down the
federal government.
Our job, is to get undercover
in these cells...
and find these bombs.
So who do we think
is orchestrating this ?
The agency's been at this
from every angle...
and all we know is that
he's got deep ressources,
an ability to coordinate
diverse groups,
and by all indications...
he's an American.
We were broken up
into groups of two.
Each unit was...
assigned a terrorist cell.
One agent went undercover,
one acted as a handler.
You can't expect me to believe
you were sent here...
undercover.
What's so special
about this place ?
You know, I would
show you, but...
that's clever.
It's over there...
behind the map.
Where did you get this ?
Those are defense department projections
they've been doing since the 50s.
The fallout scenarios in the event of
a nuclear attack on 20 US cities.
And you see Jericho ?
It's outside the fallout zones, Jake.
It's got a salt mine,
plenty of farm land,
and access to an untainted
water table.
So you weren't here to
monitor phone calls ?
Jericho was a rally-point in case
we failed in our mission.
Failed ?
Or succeeded ?
And Johnston, was...
He wanted to come,
I know he did.
He's just having a hard time
dealing with things lately.
He always gets quiet...
when he's going through
something, but...
just wish I could think
of something
to help him get through this.
We miss you, sweetheart.
There's no more sprouts.
You finished them ?
I was hungry.
What are you doing here, Sean.
It's like 9:30 in the morning...
Oh, my...
You slept here ?
Well, actually... there was not a
lot of sleeping going on.
Get out of the house !
What are you doing ?
- You let him spend a night ?
- Yes.
Well that doesn't seem like something
Stanley would approve of, does it ?
Stanley's not here.
Just like that. You infiltrated a
terror cell planning a nuclear attack ?
Yeah...
just like that.
It took me 2 years.
8 months of it in prison...
developing contacts,
getting into the network.
The only outside person I
communicated with was my handler.
After prison,
I spent another year
trying to gain their trust
on the outside.
And even then, I was only
scratching the surface.
But you got in.
How ?
They were looking for
high grade government IDs.
You gave them their badges !
I had to proove that I was loyal
and valuable to the cell, Jake.
- I think I've heard enough.
- No !
You barely scratched
the surface.
You're the one who
wanted to hear this,
so why don't you hear it all ?
The cell was looking for IDs.
And I needed to get higher up
in their organisation.
So I let it be known
that I had a source.
See, the badges...
were going to be tagged so that
my team could track them.
They sent me to make the buy
with another cell member.
It was a kid named Daryl.
How do we know
these are real ?
They're real enough.
Where did you get them from ?
How and where I got these
badges... is my business.
What you do with them...
is yours.
- Nice doing business with you.
- You too.
We should celebrate, man.
Go out, get some girls.
Except you don't really seem
like the type. All serious.
Are you married ?
I was.
Really ?
What happened ?
What the hell is going on ?
Hold it right there !
I'm sorry man.
You gotta be kidding me.
FBI !
Hands in the air !
Back against the car.
<i>It turns out Daryl was
an FBI informant.
But my handler got me out,
and we kept my cover intact.
So the FBI have an informant
in my target cell.
And they can't tell us
anything about that ?
You know, I'm damn lucky
that my cover wasn't blown.
- Your cover's intact, yes ?
- Yeah, we believe so.
Then let's move on.
Have you been able to make contact
with those coordinating the attack ?
No... but at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells
that we've already inflitrated.
You know, at the very least that
would disrupt the overall plan...
maybe delay it for...
- How many of the bombs can you get ?
A third, for sure...
half if we're lucky.
Look... I know...
it's not ideal, but at this stage,
it is the safest move.
That's still a dozen
bombs in play.
- What are you doing ?
- I just think there's a way to...
speed this up and get
all the bombs at once.
- Yeah, and we agreed that...
- Do you mind ?
I think there may be a way
to get us further inside.
My partner tells the cell leader
that Daryl is the FBI informant.
That gives him the credibility
that he needs to move up faster.
Then let us handle the FBI...
and do whatever is necessary
to save the operation.
- It's all gonna take some time,
but we're close  - OK.
We're counting on you,
and you know the risks.
You'd better be right about this.
This is the right way to go.
Trust me.
What would you have done ?
Stayed in,
or pulled the plug ?
It seems like the wrong
question to me.
I'd ask myself how much
I trusted my partner.
Well, if I can sneak up here without
you so much as turning around...
how are you gonna
hear any game ?
I heard you half a mile
back in those shoes.
You said you'd come with me
to see April today.
Fine.
You coming home for dinner ?
There are no deer in these woods,
they've all been picked clean.
Then, I guess I'll
be here a while.
I never wanted to be a mom'.
I didn't sign up for this.
You know what, you're right.
I owe it to Stanley.
So I'm just gonna have
to jump in...
with both feet, whether she wants
to hear from me or not.
Listen to me going on
about my own problems.
You must be ady to take this hatchet
and do the damn job yourself.
I didn't know that he
knew how to sign.
What did he say to you ?
Never mind, look...
That boy's bad news.
Now, I can't stop you
from seeing him...
but he is no longer welcome in this
house, do you understand me ?
Allison...
so why do you feel like you
can't hang out at home ?
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.
It's not that I don't wanna
talk about it.
It's just...
my family's pretty weird.
My family was pretty weird too.
In fact, when I was your age, I didn't
want to hang out with them either.
What about now ?
They're gone.
There's this thing that went
down at my house...
a couple weeks ago.
I did something.
OK. What did you do ?
I did something that...
can't be forgiven.
Now my mom just keeps...
looking at me.
Like I've changed into some kind
of monster, or something.
You know you haven't, right ?
So... even though you
weren't sure about the plan,
you outed the informant
to the cell leader.
Once we decided to leave
the bombs in play,
it was the only way for me to
get deep enough into the cell
and gain their trust.
I told the cell leader that
Daryl was the informant,
but I wanted to get him out of there
before they killed him.
Come on, grab what you
need and let's go.
They're gonna hunt me down,
and they're gonna kill me.
It's your lucky day, Daryl.
They're gonna get you into witness
protection, so don't worry.
We're gonna get
you out of here.
Stay there.
- Damn it !
- What is it ?
<i>Daryl, we just wanna talk.
The cell leader.
You gotta get me
out of this place.
Run !
I'll tell them that
you got away.
I think my leg is broken.
Please, help me !
Or I'm gonna tell them
who you really are.
I'm sorry.
<i>So, I finally gain their trust.
<i>I was in.
You killed him.
It was either killed him...
or possibly let millions
of people die.
They died anyway.
<i>Jake ?
<i>You're still down there ?
Call him off.
You're not helping your cause by
keeping that gun in my face.
<i>Hey, Jake ?
Do not make me kill him Jake.
All right.
- All right !
<i>- Jake ?
What's going on, Jake ?
We need a little more
time, that's all.
- You're sure ?
- Yeah, we're all right.
- I... I'm out front.
- OK.
Turn around, Jake.
It is not about this anymore.
We're past this.
Starting now,
we trust each other.
You need to tell me everything.
Done telling.
Now, I gotta show you.
What are you doing here ?
It's your first day
at a new school.
You know, the last time you had one
of those, Sam was in diapers.
Doesn'’t look like you
had a big turnout.
No, most people left early.
I guess you knew better.
I figured you didn't really want
me around the house anyway.
Why would you say that ?
You know...
because of what I did.
Allison, I love you.
OK ? Nothing will
change that.
Hear me baby ?
Nothing will change that.
My little girl.
Mom, please
don't be mad at me.
I'm so sorry, mom'.
- Here's the part I don't get.
- What ?
If you're telling the truth...
you made it.
You made it deep inside the cell,
you gained their trust.
Right.
Then, what happened ?
Somebody tipped off the
terrorists, Jake.
Before we could find out who...
<i>the terrorists moved up
their plan.
Victor ?
We made a mistake,
<i>a very big mistake.</i>
This is the moment we prepared for.
Strike will go off tomorrow,
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.
OK. No... listen !
The trucks...
they're white.
License plate
Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...
<i>I tried to warn the agency...
<i>but we were too late.
Some of the bombs were meant
for New York.
We managed to head them off.
Even after 4 years of work...
I couldn't stop all of them.
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.
Since when have
you been funny ?
I have always been funny.
Yeah, not for a long time.
What is it Rob ?
- Rob ?
- I won't be long.
Not interrupting, am I ?
You know you are.
You're not exactly
returning our calls.
I told my wife I was done.
I promised her, Victor.
- We need you back.
- Why me ?
Because you're the best
at what you do.
Which is what ?
Your family will be there,
when you get back.
Team is meeting tomorrow.
Come listen to what this
is all about.
If you wanna walk
away after that...
you walk away.
2 o'clock...
tomorrow.
Tell the desk jockey you have an
appointment with Mr. Higgins.
If they ask about the weather...
tell hem it's gonna rain.
Who was that ?
I might need to go
to a meeting tomorow.
I can't keep doing this,
I can't.
We'll be fine, D.
What is that ?
It's the end of the
rabbit hole, Jake.
Gimme a hand with this.
So you believe me now ?
Is that what I think it is ?
It was meant for Columbus, Ohio.
You brought a nuclear bomb...
here.
What would you have
done with it ?
What do you gonna do with it ?
I'm gonna keep it safe.
I'm gonna keep it secret,
you know. Because...
it gives the town some power, Jake,
but it also makes them a target.
Look...
I know what you're thinking...
You're wishing you'd walked away
when I gave you the chance, right ?
Why didn’t you show me thing
when I walked in the door today.
You didn't walk in.
<i>Jake ?
<i>Hey, Jake ?
I've been watching you, Jake...
and you can handle yourself.
And I've seen what a help
you have been to this stown.
But I needed to know
that I can trust you.
That you could handle it
if I told you everything.
<i>Jake ?
This bomb...
it's our burden, now.
Whatever happens next...
that is gonna be
up to you. OK ?
He's FBI.
Just like he said.
But...
We're in good hands.
That's good to hear.
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Hawkins.
We do that, outside.
I didn't know that.
There’s something
I want to say to you.
I'm still learning...
so just, please bear with me.
Stanley...
is...
important...
to me.
You... are...
important... to me.
I... want... you...
to be safe.
So please... be patient...
with me.
I'm trying...
I'll try too.
So...
hug ?
Right.
I brought you some dinner.
Thank you.
<i>You know what, I am damn lucky
that my cover wasn’t blown.
<i>- Your cover's intact ?
- Yeah, we believe so.
<i>Then let's move on.
<i>But at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

infiltrated...

can you get ?

Oh, mon Dieu, Ted.
- Jake, je te présente Ted Lewis.
- Salut, comment ça va ?
On a grandi ensemble
à New Bern.
Voici Russell et Mike.
- Salut
- On se connait.
Avec une douzaine d'éoliennes,
on peut alimenter la ville entière.
Je vais tout faire pour ramener
la lumière dans nos foyers.
- Tu vas nous quitter ?
- Pas pour longtemps.
<i>Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les élections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
- Ils en avaient marre que tu sois
shérif ? - Je suis toujours shérif.
J'ai juste plus d'autorité.
Ce truc fonctionne ?
On peut avoir du courant avec ?
Probablement dès demain.
Montons-la aussi vite que possible.
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
Vous possédez les seules mines
de sel à 650km à la ronde.
- Et pour la nourriture ?
- La prochaine récolte est au printemps.
C'est bien de ça que je parle.
10 éoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la récolte.
Non, on ne peut pas
accepter ça.
Crevez de faim,
ou mourrez de froid...
OK, bon, on vous donnera
la nourriture.
On peut vous apporter les
éoliennes dans 2 semaines.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
C'est vraiment pour
vous filer un coup de main ?
Ou c'est plutôt pour vous assurer
que vous aurez nos récoltes ?
Je vais pas construire
ces trucs à crédit.
Vous les voulez ?
Va falloir nous aider.
Mais ce que vous allez faire...
est vital pour cette ville.
Allez, allons-y.
Si quoi que ce soit leur arrive...
c'est toi que je viendrai
voir en premier.
Je sais.
<i>Salut.
Jeff, les revoilà.
Je ne pensais pas vous voir
avant le printemps, Russell.
Je pensais que vous auriez
besoin de ceci.
Vos éoliennes.
C'est bon de revoir nos gars, mais...
je vais avoir besoin d'un peu
de temps pour les remplacer.
Vous n'avez pas besoin de les remplacer.
Bien, mais, attendez...
on s'était mis d'accord
pour dix éoliennes...
contre 10% de la récolte.
Vous aurez vos éoliennes, mais nous
n'avons pas besoin de vos gars.
Constantino à appelé ça, une
preuve de bonne foi.
Ça m'étonnerait que Constantino
connaisse ce genre de terme.
Mais...
J'accepte volontiers.
Stanley !
- Bienvenue à la maison.
- Merci.
Où est Eric ?
Il n'est pas revenu, Mary.
Il a dit qu'il ne se sentait pas prêt.
Mais...
Je suis sûr qu'il reviendra vite.
OK.
Merci.
Je ne savais pas que vous
reveniez aujourd'hui les gars.
- Aucun de nous ne le savait.
- Comment allez-vous ?
Où est Eric ?
Viens par là.
Il n'est pas revenu avec nous.
Pourquoi ?
Il est toujours très affecté
par la mort d'April.
Il m'a dit qu'il pensait rester
encore un moment à New Bern
pour faire le point.
- Quand était-ce ?
Il y a trois jours.
Depuis, il ne s'est pas montré
pour le travail, et je ne l'ai pas revu.
Je ne sais pas ce qui se
trame à New Bern.
Personne n'a pu me
répondre pour Eric.
Depuis, les flics nous escortent
partout où on va.
Et hier, subitement,
Russell a dit...
"Faites vos bagages, on rentre à
la maison", comme...
comme si on n'était plus
en sécurité là-bas.
Où est mon frère ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Quoi ?
Il a disparu depuis
quelques jours.
Et vous avez essayé
de le chercher ?
- J'ai demandé à Constantino.
- Et ?
Et il m'a dit qu'ils étaient en
train de le rechercher.
Et puis ce matin, il m'a dit de
ramener tous vos gars chez eux.
Qu'est-ce qui se trame
là-bas, Russell ?
Dois-je m'inquiéter pour lui ?
Réponds-moi.
Dois-je m'inquiéter ?
Je pense, oui.
- Je viens avec toi.
- Non...
tu es parti des semaines. Rentre.
Tu ne connais même pas New Bern.
Heather pourra m'aider là-bas.
Personne ne connaît mieux le coin.
Écoute, ça craint dehors.
Tu ne peux pas y aller seul.
J'irai pas seul.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.

Tu ne peux pas aller à New Bern,
et faire ta petite guerre, Jake.
Faut que j'essaie de le trouver.
Je ne peux pas...
Je sens qu'il se passe
un truc étrange dans cette ville.
Stanley leur pose quelques questions,
et ils les renvoient chez eux ?
OK, mais tu comprends que
je ne peux pas partir comme ça, hein ?
- C'est mon frère.
- T'u dis qu'il était contrarié,
alors, peut-être...
- Dis simplement "Non".
Allons Jake, je ne dis pas "non".
Je dis qu'on doit
analyser la situation.
La situation, c'est que...
il a disparu depuis 3 jours,
et je viens...
te demander de l'aide.
Mais alors,
on le fait à ma manière.
Oh mon Dieu.
- Je suis si contente de te voir.
- Vous m'avez tellement manqué.
T'es revenu entier.
<i>Mme Green,
désolée de vous déranger, mais...
je pensais que vous devriez savoir.
Savoir quoi ?
Les hommes sont revenus
de New Bern, sans Eric.
Pourquoi ?
Il a décidé de rester plus longtemps.
Il a décidé ou
Constantino a insisté ?
Stanley lui a parlé.
Il a dit...
qu'il ne se sentait pas
prêt à revenir.
- Comment t'es-tu blessé la main ?
- Oh, j'essayais...
de réparer la tuyauterie
de l'alambic.
Il s'est cassé et m'a coupée.
L'alcool est-il vraiment
une priorité ?
C'est pas pour le boire.
J'essaie de fabriquer
de l'antiseptique pour l'hôpital.
- Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
- Tu as du sable dans ton bar ?
Du sable ?
Ouais, je pourrais te montrer
un truc pour ta tuyauterie.
Je vais te filer un coup de main.
Je reviens vite.
Les gars... attendez.
Ne déchargez plus.
Remettez-les.
C'est quoi ça ?
- Du sel.
- Qui t'a autorisé à le ramener ?
51% de la mine m'appartient.
Je prends simplement ma part.
Tu ne possèdes rien.
Ça appartient à tes parents.
Je sais que vous me voyez
encore comme une enfant...
et je ne peux pas
y faire grand-chose,
mais j'ai un droit
sur ce qui m'appartient.
Tu es mineure,
rien ne t'appartient
tant que tes parents
sont encore en vie.
À moins que tu aies
des informations qui m'échappent ?
Écoute, ramène ce sel à la mine,
arrange-toi pour que mes hommes
n'aient pas à le faire.
Justificatif de domicile ?
Nous ne sommes pas d'ici.
Désolé, vous allez devoir
faire demi-tour
et repartir d'où vous venez.
Je suis venu voir
mon frère, Eric Green.
Écoutez-moi.
Personne n'est autorisé...
Vous, écoutez-moi.
Je dois le voir.
Il faisait parti de l'accord
passé avec Jericho. Alors...
Hé, Jake...
Je veux parler à Phil Constantino.
- Descendez de la voiture.
- Je pense pas.
Les mains sur le tableau de bord.
Je veux voir vos mains.
C'est le fils de Johnston Green.
Laissez-les passer.
Je vais les escorter jusqu'au
shérif Constantino.
<i>Allez, laissez-les passer.
Monsieur, monsieur.
Vous auriez à manger ?
Désolé, je...
Désolé, j'ai rien.
Madame, s'il vous plaît.
Eloignez vos enfants.
Allez.
<i>S'il vous plait.</i>
Et moi qui pensais
qu'on avait souffert.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ici ?
Ravenwood.
Mon frère a disparu.
Je sais, et j'ai envoyé des
hommes à sa recherche.
- Aucune piste ?
- Non.
Désolé, j'aimerai pouvoir faire plus.
Tu es Shérif, et Maire,
tu peux faire bien mieux.
J'essaye, Jake.
Mais veut-il vraiment
qu'on le trouve ?
Ça veut dire quoi ?
On connait tous April,
et ce qui lui est arrivé.
Apparemment, Eric avait
quelques problèmes.
Tou ira mieux s'il
rentre chez lui.
Écoute, regardons les
choses en face.
Il a pu se faire attaquer, et jeter
dans un fossé quelque part.
- Mais qu'est-ce que t'en...
- Doucement !
La vérité, c'est que...
les gens n'apprécient pas vraiment
beaucoup Jericho en ce moment.
J'ai renvoyé tous les
ouvriers chez eux.
Je craignais pour leur sécurité.
Pourquoi ?
Il y a pas mal de rumeurs
qui circulent sur votre ville.
Que disent-ils ?
Ils vous en veulent de ne rien
avoir dit pour Ravenwood.
Et ils pensent que vous ne respecterez
pas le marché pour la nourriture.
On en a bavé ici, tu comprends ?
Ils cherchent un
bouc-émissaire.
- Où Eric a été vu en dernier ?
- À l'usine...
quand son équipe finissait.
Écoutez, on essaye de vous aider.
Que voulez-vous de plus ?
Je veux parler à
Heather Lisinski.
<i>Prenez soin de vous au Kansas.
Des nouvelles de M. Hewitt ?
Non, c'est toujours la même info sur les
émeutes du camp ouest de Chicago.
Merci de faire équipe avec nous.
Jimmy, c'est le moins que je puisse
faire pour me rendre utile.
Chez vous, j'ai l'impression
d'être un poids inutile.
Vous plaisantez ?
Vous êtes la meilleure
hôte que je connaisse.
Vous faites la cuisine, la vaisselle,
et vous aimez jouer au Boggle.
On redoute le moment ou tout
s'arrangera avec votre mari.
Je ne voulais pas
paraître insensible.
- Désolé.
- Non, je comprends. Merci.
Écoutez...
je peux vous parler d'un truc ?
De quoi s'agit-il ?
Hier soir, Sam et Woody étaient...
en train de dessiner.
Sam a fait celui-ci.
Je ne voulais pas en parler devant
tout le monde à la maison,
je ne voulais pas être embarrassant.
Non, merci beaucoup de
me l'avoir montré.
Je ne suis pas psychologue,
mais ce garçon semble vraiment
avoir été traumatisé.
Il n'y a rien de surprenant.
30 millions de personnes sont
mortes il y a peu de temps.
Pour tous les enfants, ce doit
être difficile de l'accepter.
Surement, mais c'est tellement précis.
Les corps, la maison...
Je lui en parlerai quand
il reviendra de l'école.
- Merci.
- Pas de quoi.
Le sable empêche le
cuivre de s'oxyder.
D'où tenez-vous ça ?
Et bien...
comme toutes les choses marrantes,
et illégales que je connais...
de mon père.
Alors, Eric avait raison.
J'ai bien peur que oui.
Vous connaissez ce livre...
qui disait que...
les femmes viennent de Venus,
et que les hommes ont tort ?
Non pas que j'aie lu le livre,
mais j'ai...
jeté un coup d'oeil
à celui de Gail.
Il y est beaucoup question
d'hommes qui ont besoin de...
prendre du recul, et s'isoler
de temps en temps.
Je ne sais pas si c'est
vraiment dans ce livre, mais...
si un homme veut s'isoler,
il trouvera un moyen.
Peu importe...
les moyens, et les évènements
qui l'entourent.
Ouais, vous avez surement raison.
C'est surement de
cela qu'il s'agit.
Vous n'avez rien à vous
reprocher, Mary.
Ni personne d'autre.
Et je pense qu'Eric
en est conscient.
C'est grâce à cet endroit que
New Bern a pu s'en sortir.
Cette usine est le coeur
battant de la ville.
Regroupez toutes ces
turbines par là.
Shérif !
Qui est-ce ?
Un ami d'Heather, on l'a
rencontré à Black Jack.
Bonne nouvelle.
- Il sait où se trouve votre frère.
- Vraiment ? Où ?
Eric est rentré chez lui.
Lui et Heather...
Ils sont partis ce matin.
- Chez lui ? À Jericho ?
- Mais pourquoi ?
Ils auraient pu rentrer
avec les autres ?
Heather voulait lui parler
au moment du départ...
alors, ils sont partis sans eux.
Je leur ai prêté ma
voiture et mon fusil.
Tout semblait aller bien.
Ils sont surement déjà
à Jericho maintenant.
Bon.
- J'espère qu'ils vont bien.
- Merci.
- On doit quitter le bâtiment.
- D'accord.
Qu se passe-t-il ?
Il a fallu rénover les machines
après l'EMP, et...
une d'entre elles a surchauffé
et mis le feu au bâtiment.
Vous êtes satisfait ?
Ouais, le mystère
est éclairci.
C'est bon à entendre.
Dans ce cas, l'Adjoint Perkins
va vous reconduire.
Non, on n'a pas
besoin d'escorte.
C'est la règle.
Vous êtes intransigeants
sur les règles.
On a quasiment tout perdu après
le passage de Ravenwood.
Je suis intransigeant sur tout
ce qui nous maintient en vie.
- Merci.
- De rien.
Poussez le camion.
<i>Laissez-les passer.
- Franchement, tu y crois ?
- Pas du tout.
Et Ted non plus.
Il m'a passé ça en
me serrant la main.
- C'est une adresse, et...
- "Venez seuls"
On en a fini ici, alors ?
<i>Reculez.
<i>Laissez-les passer.
Je suis parti combien
de temps ?
Non, avant de répondre...
il est là depuis quand ?
- C'est très récent.
Ça ne fait pas si
longtemps que ça.
Je ne t'ai demandé
qu'une chose, Mimi.
Juste une !
Écoute-moi, Stanley.
Ta soeur n'est plus une gamine.
Tu ne peux pas ignorer leur
relation et virer Sean,
en pensant que ça sera fini.
Et tu peux me dire pourquoi ?
Parce que si tu fais ça...
elle s'accrochera encore
plus à cette relation.
Et si ça leur prend vraiment la tête,
comme tous les ados, ils s'enfuiront.
Au mieux, on les reverra dans 2 ou 3
jours quand ils seront à cours d'argent.
Mais par les temps qui courent...
on risque plutôt de retrouver leurs
corps sur le bord d'une route.
Écoute...
pour l'instant ça se passe ici.
Ça t'emmerde, je le sais,
mais c'est un emmerdement
gérable et sans risques.
Je te conseille de l'autoriser à rester,
avant que ça devienne bien pire.
Le camion de Perkins.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fout planté là
devant la caravane de Ted ?
On va lui demander.
Passe ton arme à mon copain et
on va rendre une petite visite à Ted.
Plus vite !
Où est mon frère ?
Je sais pas.
Demande-lui.
Il voulait me foutre en tôle
si je ne vous racontais pas ça.
- Et Eric ?
- Pas vu depuis des jours.
- Heather ?
- Elle est partie bosser ce matin.
Maintenant elle est
portée disparue aussi.
2 personnes disparues...
et personne ne sait rien ?
- Oh si, quelqu'un sait.
Hein ?
Où est-il ?
Va te faire foutre.
Du calme, Jake.
Il faut la jouer plus rusé.
Il nous faut des réponses.
Obtenir des réponses...
c'est assez facile.
Mais obtenir la vérité...
demande un peu
plus d'efforts.
Quand avez-vous vu Eric Green
pour la dernière fois ?
Écoutez...
c'est pas mes affaires.
C'est pas ce que
je vous ai demandé.
Pourquoi vous agissez comme si
on lui avait fait du mal ?
On a été attaqués.
Par qui ?
Les machines n'ont
pas surchauffé
ce matin, à l'usine.
C'est son frère...
et cette fille.
Il les ont sabotées.
Ils n'auraient pas fait ça.
Cette usine nous est autant
utile qu'à vous.
- Je les ai vus.
- Alors où sont-ils ?
Ils se sont enfuis.
Tu peux lui tenir les genoux ?
Écoutez,
pourquoi je surveillerais
le terrain de caravaning
si on les tenait, hein ?
Constantino a déclenché l'alerte.
Il a donné un SOS.
- SOS ? <i>[ Shoot On Sight ]</i>
- Tirer à vue.
Regardez-moi.
Il y a quoi dans cette usine ?
Je ne sais pas.
Non, je suis qu'un flic.
Demandez à Constantino.
Demandez à Constantino.
Il le sait ?
Regardez-moi.
- On va à l'usine.
- Mais Eric...
Je ne sais pas pour Eric.
On ne peut pas
fouiller toute la ville.
Alors on ferait mieux de découvrir
pour quoi il a risqué sa vie.
D'accord.
Tu as un endroit sûr où aller ?
Ouais, mon grand-père possède
une vieille cabane de chasse.
Emmène ce que tu possèdes d'important,
car tu ne reviendras pas.
Debout.
À genoux.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
- Mettez-vous à genoux.
- Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
C'est ça, ta manière ?
C'est toi qui m'as demandé de venir.
- T'allais faire quoi ?
- Tu veux la vérité ?
On en a eu qu'une partie.
Tu vois, j'ai...
assez d'expérience, Jake,
pour en savoir plus.
C'est la peur de la torture
qui donne des résultats.
La vraie torture
fonctionne que dans les films.
Il y avait ce type,
tellement maigre,
qu'on voyait ses côtes
à travers sa chemise.
Je lui donnais de la nourriture,
mais on avait plus grand-chose alors...
Puis un jour, j'ai...
vu dans son regard... qu'il...
il avait abandonné.
Je pensais pas être un jour si
contente de vivre dans une ferme.
À partir de maintenant,
je promets de ne plus me plaindre.
On a pas grand-chose, mais...
on en aura toujours assez, alors...
Mec, tout ce qu'il faut faire,
c'est rétablir internet.
Après, ça sera du gâteau.
Pourquoi ça ?
On pourra tout faire.
Élire un nouveau président,
construire une Maison-Blanche virtuelle,
écraser un avion dessus.
Des villes virtuelles...
- Tout sera nouveau.
- Ouais, mais...
où vas-tu trouver...
le matériel ?
Quel matériel ?
Je sais pas.
Nourriture, vêtements,
couverture, essence.
C'est pas un problème.
Dès qu'on aura internet,
y aura plus qu'à commander.
Tu sais Stanley,
tu n'as pas idée
comme Sean a été
utile pour le bétail,
la maison et...
tout en fait.
C'est vrai.
Ouais, c'est bizarre Stanley, car...
je suis plutôt un mec stylé.
C'est quoi un mec stylé ?
Tu sais...
Je veux dire,
je suis pas trop...
travail manuel.
Je suis plutôt le genre de mecs
qu'on fréquente pour son style.
Ma maison, mes règles, mon style.
Et toi, tu dors là.
Et alors, vers 3 h du matin,
y a cette torche qui m'éblouit.
Gail bondit de son côté du lit
pour attraper le téléphone
et appeler la Police quand finalement,
je trouve l'interrupteur.
C'était Eric,
qui se tenait là et qui dit :
"Avant d'aller dormir, fallait que je
vous avoue que je suis bourré."
J'ai répondu : "T'es quoi ?"
Il a dit : "Bourré."
"Ça n'arrivera plus.
Je ne sais pas ce qui m'a pris."
Pourtant, il paraissait
parfaitement sobre,
il articulait bien.
Gail l'a cuisiné. Il s'est avéré
qu'il avait bu une bière et demie.
Je lui dit :
"Fiston, t'as une idée..."
"du nombre de bières
nécessaires pour être bourré ?"
Il a répondu : "Non, aucune."
Je lui dis : "Alors, sors d'ici..."
"et me réveille pas
jusqu'à ce que tu le sois."
Il est parti,
Gail et moi avons eu un fou rire.
Elle ne rigole plus
beaucoup désormais.
Bon je divague un peu. On ferait
mieux de retourner à cet alambic.
Bonne idée.
Salut, mon pote.
Ta maman s'est absentée quelques
instants. Assieds-toi.
Tu peux nous laisser une minute ?
Bien sûr.
Bon, tu sais quoi ?
Pourquoi on n'irait pas dans mon
bureau, on pourrait discuter.
De quoi ?
De tes dessins.
Salut.
Je te présente Russell.
Il a sauvé nos fesses
à Black Jack.
Enchantée.
Je m'appelle Skylar.
Stevens, c'est ça ?
On peut t'aider ?
Je pense plutôt
qu'on peut s'entraider.
Vous avez une mine de sel
sans réel distributeur.
J'ai des hommes,
des camions, des armes,
mais pas de nourriture.
- Si on s'alliait...
- S'allier ?
Je demande la moitié
de ce qui t'appartient.
On se débrouille, maintenant.
Les gens de Jericho ne sont pas
les seuls à avoir besoin de sel.
J'ai erré un peu.
Je sais où aller, qui rencontrer,
et je sais comment revenir
ici un seul morceau.
Qu'est-ce qu'on y gagne ?
De gros bénéfices.
Là où je vais, vous pouvez
vous faire 5 fois plus qu'ici.
Et...
je négocierai avec
Gray Anderson pour vous.
Pour quand voulez-vous
une réponse ?
Avant que je parte,
dans la matinée.
Croyez-moi,
tout le monde y trouvera
son compte.
C'est un inventaire complet
des ressources de Jericho.
C'est notre mine.
Et notre ville.
Ils l'ont partagée, comme
si elle leur apppartenait !
Que savent-ils que
nous ignorons ?
Viens.
Chéri.
Que se passe-t-il ?
On a parlé de mes dessins.
Écoute, tu peux attendre dans
l'entrée un instant ?
Je dois parler à M. Taylor seule.
OK ?
Que faites-vous ?
Darcy, quelque chose se passe,
sans rapport avec les bombes.
Mon fils à assez de choses à
s'occuper, sans être...
brusqué ni interrogé.
S'il y a un problème avec lui,
je m'en chargerai personnellement.
D'accord.
Merci.
Pour quoi ?
De laisser Sean rester.
De rien.
Et pour ne pas le traiter
d'idiot même si c'en est un.
Ok, si tu sais que...
Désolé. J'avais juste un
chat dans la gorge.
Je ne voulais pas interrompre votre
moment de complicité fraternelle.
C'est bien ça, n'est-ce pas ?
Sean peut être idiot,
mais il peut aussi être super.
Tous les mecs sont comme ça,
il faut faire avec leur côté "idiot"...
pour avoir leur bon côté.
Vraiment ? Et d'où te vient ce
soudain éclair de sagesse ?
Qu'est ce qu'elle a dit sur moi ?
Quand a-t-il appris le
langage des signes ?
Il couche avec une sourde.
C'est ma soeur.
Je pense que si Sean Henthorn est
mon plus gros problème, alors
je suis un mec chanceux.
Tu veux être encore
plus chanceux ?
Que fais-tu ?
C'est un contrat... d'après l'avocat,
avec ça, je serai émancipée.
En déclarant vos parents morts ?
Ce n'est pas correct... en aucun cas tu
ne peux faire ça, c'est injuste.
- Oublie tout ça.
- C'est hors de question.
- C'est légal.
- Et...
quoi, tu vas aller en vélo jusqu'à
Topeka pour l'enregistrer, Dale ?
Oubliez que je suis le Maire.
Je te parle en tant qu'ami
de tes parents.
Mes parents auraient voulu
que j'aie ma part de la mine.
Tes parents vont revenir.
Et s'il s'avère que
ce n'est pas le cas,
alors je t'aiderai à
apprendre ce travail.
Et qui décidera que
c'est le moment ?
Vous ?
J'ai pris ma décision,
il n'y a donc plus de loi ?
Tu n'a pas pris de décision.
Tu as signé un bout de papier.
Souhaites-tu vraiment si fort
que tes parents soient morts ?
- Bon, arrêtez.
- Non.
Puisque tu la conseilles, lui as-tu
aussi dit comment ils sont morts ?
New York est intacte,
Donc je pense que tu as dû
être très imaginatif, non ?
Ont-ils été tués là bas ?
Ou ont-ils été tués
en revenant
vers l'enfant qui veut
tout leur prendre ?
C'est juste un bout de papier.
Viens.
Ils fabriquent des obus de mortiers.
C'est une usine d'armement.
<i>Dépechez-vous.
Constantino les veut pour ce soir.
<i>Ils seront prêts.
Ils se préparent pour
une guerre !
Il faut retourner en ville.
Non, il faut absolument
les arrêter. Couvre-moi.
<i>Il est parti par là.
Venez.
Lâche ça !
Donne-moi ça.
Désolé. Je crois que je suis en
retard pour le diner.
Ou le déjeuner.
Fais ton choix.
J'aidai Mary. Ça a pris plus de
temps que je le croyais.
Tu as dit à Eric qu'on
s'occuperait d'elle.
Ce que je voulais dire,
c'est qu'on la garderait en vie.
Ça ne voulait pas dire
qu'on la sortirait,
ou qu'on passerait notre
temps avec elle
chaque fois qu'elle a
besoin de réconfort.
Attends.
Tu ne penses pas qu'Eric est
parti à cause de moi ?
Si ?
C'est ce que tu penses ?
Je pense qu' Eric est parti pour
beaucoup de raisons...
mais Mary est peut être
celle qui le fera revenir.
Je ne veux pas avoir a
revenir dans cette maison.
Tu as pris tous tes jouets ?
Alors,
de quoi avez-vous
parlé avec M. Taylor ?
De rien.
Non, Sam, tu sais qu'on ne garde
aucun secret dans la famille.
Oui, je sais, bébé.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fiche ici ?
Je crois qu'on devrait parler.
Sam, chéri, tu peux monter dans ta
chambre chercher le dernier carton ?
Salut, petit.
Écoutez, je comprends que vous soyez
curieux à propos de ma famille.
Nous n'avons pas
beaucoup d'amis ici.
On ne s'exprime pas beucoup, mais...
si vous voulez poser des questions,
demandez-moi, OK ?
Laissez mes enfants.
Mais je pense que Sam essaye de nous
dire quelque chose avec ses dessins.
Quelque chose qu'il ne
peut pas formuler.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Il dessine un petit garçon
qui a peur...
parce que son père n'est
pas là pour le protéger,
lui ou sa famille.
Je lui ai dit qu'il
n'était pas seul.
Je sais ce que c'est que d'avoir
des parents séparés.
Je lui ai dit que j'avais
traversé la même chose, et...
je pense que je m'en
suis bien sorti, alors...
Je pense que vous vous en êtes
très bien sorti, Jimmy.
Je vous remercie.
Je vais retourner à la
maison maintenant.
On se voit là-bas.
Merci, Jimmy.
De rien.
- Comment ça avance ?
- Pas mal.
Toues les éoliennes ont été
montées sans problèmes.
Mer...
Merci.
Vous avez tenu vos promesses.
Même plus.
Je suis content que vous
le preniez ainsi,
parce que j'ai une autre
proposition à vous faire.
Nous avons besoin de sel.
Aucun problème. Je vais demander
à mes gars de charger vos camions.
Et bien, en fait...
je pensai vous aider à le vendre.
Nous pensions à un quart
des revenus de la mine.
C'est une idée de Constantino ?
C'est la raison de toutes
ces bonnes intentions ?
Non. Écoutez-moi.
On y trouvera tous notre compte.
Nos deux villes.
Si vous m'autorisez à vendre
du sel de la mine.
Je suis désolé.
Je suppose que vous et les jumeaux Olsen
pensez que c'est une sorte de faveur.
Et bien, pour ce que ça vaut,
ce serait une transaction légale.
On ne vend pas.
Vos gars à New Bern pensent
que ce serait bien.
- Peu m'importe ce qu'ils pensent.
- C'est bien dommage.
Quand j'ai vu cette...
carte de Jericho,
j'ai posé des questions
à Heather.
Elle ne pensait pas que...
New Bern pourrait
nous faire ça.
Alors elle a fouiné, et...
elle a vu les mortiers et...
leurs plans.
Écoutez, vous allez retourner
gentiment d'où vous venez.
Dan, viens ici !
M. le Maire, il y a beaucoup plus
en jeu que vous le pensez.
- Vraiment ?
- J'essaye de vous aider.
New Bern a difficilement
passé l'hiver.
Les gens savent que la nourriture
venait de chez vous.
Et ils savent aussi qu'il n'y en aura
jamais assez pour tout le monde,
alors ils commencent à se demander
ce qu'ils pourraient faire.
Alors ?
Emmène le plus d'adjoints
possible à la mine de sel.
Qu'elle soit sous bonne garde,
jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
Gray...
j'ai déjà des hommes là-bas.
Gray, écoute-moi.
Ce marché est valable.
Vous ne le réalisez pas encore,
mais, s'il vous plaît...
l'alternative n'est pas souhaitable.
Les rumeurs sur Jericho,
parlant de montagnes de nourriture,
du fait qu'il nous ont
envoyé Ravenwood...
ce ne sont peut-être pas
que des rumeurs.
Nous leur avons
rendu l'électricité,
et maintenant qu'ils ont
ce dont ils ont besoin,
ils n'ont pas l'intention de
tenir leur part du marché.
Pourquoi n'avez-vous pas
quitté la ville ?
Parce qu'on voulait
détruire leur matériel...
arrêter leur usine.
Et ils nous ont attrapés.
Ils m'ont jeté ici.
Et, où est-elle ?
Où est Heather ?
Elle est morte, Jake.
<i>Il ne leur suffit pas de
garder leur nourriture
Il ne leur suffit pas de
garder leur nourriture
et de nous laisser mourir.
Toi, lève-toi.
Toi aussi.
Ils veulent nous détruire.
<i>J'ai regardé leur Maire dans les yeux,
<i>je lui ai dit dans quelle situation
désespérée nous étions.
<i>Mais le jour
<i>où nous allions honorer
notre part du marché,
<i>qu'ont-ils fait ?
<i>Ils ont essayé de détruire l'usine
Ils ont essayé de détruire l'usine
qui nous fait tous vivre.
Voici les preuves.
Voici les fils de Johnston Green,
envoyés de Jericho pour semer
le chaos dans notre ville.
Maintenant nous savons,
que si ces gens avaient réussi,
New Bern aurait
cessé d'exister.
Avec votre aide,
et votre sacrifice,
je vais faire en sorte
que cela n'arrive jamais.

Oh, mon Dieu, Ted.
- Jake, je te présente Ted Lewis.
- Salut, comment ça va ?
On a grandi ensemble
à New Bern.
Voici Russell et Mike.
- Salut
- On se connait.
Avec une douzaine d'éoliennes,
on peut alimenter la ville entière.
Je vais tout faire pour ramener
la lumière dans nos foyers.
- Tu vas nous quitter ?
- Pas pour longtemps.
<i>Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les élections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
- Ils en avaient marre que tu sois
shérif ? - Je suis toujours shérif.
J'ai juste plus d'autorité.
Ce truc fonctionne ?
On peut avoir du courant avec ?
Probablement dès demain.
Montons-la aussi vite que possible.
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
Vous possédez les seules mines
de sel à 650km à la ronde.
- Et pour la nourriture ?
- La prochaine récolte est au printemps.
C'est bien de ça que je parle.
10 éoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la récolte.
Non, on ne peut pas
accepter ça.
Crevez de faim,
ou mourrez de froid...
OK, bon, on vous donnera
la nourriture.
On peut vous apporter les
éoliennes dans 2 semaines.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
C'est vraiment pour
vous filer un coup de main ?
Ou c'est plutôt pour vous assurer
que vous aurez nos récoltes ?
Je vais pas construire
ces trucs à crédit.
Vous les voulez ?
Va falloir nous aider.
Mais ce que vous allez faire...
est vital pour cette ville.
Allez, allons-y.
Si quoi que ce soit leur arrive...
c'est toi que je viendrai
voir en premier.
Je sais.
<i>Salut.
Jeff, les revoilà.
Je ne pensais pas vous voir
avant le printemps, Russell.
Je pensais que vous auriez
besoin de ceci.
Vos éoliennes.
C'est bon de revoir nos gars, mais...
je vais avoir besoin d'un peu
de temps pour les remplacer.
Vous n'avez pas besoin de les remplacer.
Bien, mais, attendez...
on s'était mis d'accord
pour dix éoliennes...
contre 10% de la récolte.
Vous aurez vos éoliennes, mais nous
n'avons pas besoin de vos gars.
Constantino à appelé ça, une
preuve de bonne foi.
Ça m'étonnerait que Constantino
connaisse ce genre de terme.
Mais...
J'accepte volontiers.
Stanley !
- Bienvenue à la maison.
- Merci.
Où est Eric ?
Il n'est pas revenu, Mary.
Il a dit qu'il ne se sentait pas prêt.
Mais...
Je suis sûr qu'il reviendra vite.
OK.
Merci.
Je ne savais pas que vous
reveniez aujourd'hui les gars.
- Aucun de nous ne le savait.
- Comment allez-vous ?
Où est Eric ?
Viens par là.
Il n'est pas revenu avec nous.
Pourquoi ?
Il est toujours très affecté
par la mort d'April.
Il m'a dit qu'il pensait rester
encore un moment à New Bern
pour faire le point.
- Quand était-ce ?
Il y a trois jours.
Depuis, il ne s'est pas montré
pour le travail, et je ne l'ai pas revu.
Je ne sais pas ce qui se
trame à New Bern.
Personne n'a pu me
répondre pour Eric.
Depuis, les flics nous escortent
partout où on va.
Et hier, subitement,
Russell a dit...
"Faites vos bagages, on rentre à
la maison", comme...
comme si on n'était plus
en sécurité là-bas.
Où est mon frère ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Quoi ?
Il a disparu depuis
quelques jours.
Et vous avez essayé
de le chercher ?
- J'ai demandé à Constantino.
- Et ?
Et il m'a dit qu'ils étaient en
train de le rechercher.
Et puis ce matin, il m'a dit de
ramener tous vos gars chez eux.
Qu'est-ce qui se trame
là-bas, Russell ?
Dois-je m'inquiéter pour lui ?
Réponds-moi.
Dois-je m'inquiéter ?
Je pense, oui.
- Je viens avec toi.
- Non...
tu es parti des semaines. Rentre.
Tu ne connais même pas New Bern.
Heather pourra m'aider là-bas.
Personne ne connaît mieux le coin.
Écoute, ça craint dehors.
Tu ne peux pas y aller seul.
J'irai pas seul.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.

Tu ne peux pas aller à New Bern,
et faire ta petite guerre, Jake.
Faut que j'essaie de le trouver.
Je ne peux pas...
Je sens qu'il se passe
un truc étrange dans cette ville.
Stanley leur pose quelques questions,
et ils les renvoient chez eux ?
OK, mais tu comprends que
je ne peux pas partir comme ça, hein ?
- C'est mon frère.
- T'u dis qu'il était contrarié,
alors, peut-être...
- Dis simplement "Non".
Allons Jake, je ne dis pas "non".
Je dis qu'on doit
analyser la situation.
La situation, c'est que...
il a disparu depuis 3 jours,
et je viens...
te demander de l'aide.
Mais alors,
on le fait à ma manière.
Oh mon Dieu.
- Je suis si contente de te voir.
- Vous m'avez tellement manqué.
T'es revenu entier.
<i>Mme Green,
désolée de vous déranger, mais...
je pensais que vous devriez savoir.
Savoir quoi ?
Les hommes sont revenus
de New Bern, sans Eric.
Pourquoi ?
Il a décidé de rester plus longtemps.
Il a décidé ou
Constantino a insisté ?
Stanley lui a parlé.
Il a dit...
qu'il ne se sentait pas
prêt à revenir.
- Comment t'es-tu blessé la main ?
- Oh, j'essayais...
de réparer la tuyauterie
de l'alambic.
Il s'est cassé et m'a coupée.
L'alcool est-il vraiment
une priorité ?
C'est pas pour le boire.
J'essaie de fabriquer
de l'antiseptique pour l'hôpital.
- Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
- Tu as du sable dans ton bar ?
Du sable ?
Ouais, je pourrais te montrer
un truc pour ta tuyauterie.
Je vais te filer un coup de main.
Je reviens vite.
Les gars... attendez.
Ne déchargez plus.
Remettez-les.
C'est quoi ça ?
- Du sel.
- Qui t'a autorisé à le ramener ?
51% de la mine m'appartient.
Je prends simplement ma part.
Tu ne possèdes rien.
Ça appartient à tes parents.
Je sais que vous me voyez
encore comme une enfant...
et je ne peux pas
y faire grand-chose,
mais j'ai un droit
sur ce qui m'appartient.
Tu es mineure,
rien ne t'appartient
tant que tes parents
sont encore en vie.
À moins que tu aies
des informations qui m'échappent ?
Écoute, ramène ce sel à la mine,
arrange-toi pour que mes hommes
n'aient pas à le faire.
Justificatif de domicile ?
Nous ne sommes pas d'ici.
Désolé, vous allez devoir
faire demi-tour
et repartir d'où vous venez.
Je suis venu voir
mon frère, Eric Green.
Écoutez-moi.
Personne n'est autorisé...
Vous, écoutez-moi.
Je dois le voir.
Il faisait parti de l'accord
passé avec Jericho. Alors...
Hé, Jake...
Je veux parler à Phil Constantino.
- Descendez de la voiture.
- Je pense pas.
Les mains sur le tableau de bord.
Je veux voir vos mains.
C'est le fils de Johnston Green.
Laissez-les passer.
Je vais les escorter jusqu'au
shérif Constantino.
<i>Allez, laissez-les passer.
Monsieur, monsieur.
Vous auriez à manger ?
Désolé, je...
Désolé, j'ai rien.
Madame, s'il vous plaît.
Eloignez vos enfants.
Allez.
<i>S'il vous plait.</i>
Et moi qui pensais
qu'on avait souffert.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ici ?
Ravenwood.
Mon frère a disparu.
Je sais, et j'ai envoyé des
hommes à sa recherche.
- Aucune piste ?
- Non.
Désolé, j'aimerai pouvoir faire plus.
Tu es Shérif, et Maire,
tu peux faire bien mieux.
J'essaye, Jake.
Mais veut-il vraiment
qu'on le trouve ?
Ça veut dire quoi ?
On connait tous April,
et ce qui lui est arrivé.
Apparemment, Eric avait
quelques problèmes.
Tou ira mieux s'il
rentre chez lui.
Écoute, regardons les
choses en face.
Il a pu se faire attaquer, et jeter
dans un fossé quelque part.
- Mais qu'est-ce que t'en...
- Doucement !
La vérité, c'est que...
les gens n'apprécient pas vraiment
beaucoup Jericho en ce moment.
J'ai renvoyé tous les
ouvriers chez eux.
Je craignais pour leur sécurité.
Pourquoi ?
Il y a pas mal de rumeurs
qui circulent sur votre ville.
Que disent-ils ?
Ils vous en veulent de ne rien
avoir dit pour Ravenwood.
Et ils pensent que vous ne respecterez
pas le marché pour la nourriture.
On en a bavé ici, tu comprends ?
Ils cherchent un
bouc-émissaire.
- Où Eric a été vu en dernier ?
- À l'usine...
quand son équipe finissait.
Écoutez, on essaye de vous aider.
Que voulez-vous de plus ?
Je veux parler à
Heather Lisinski.
<i>Prenez soin de vous au Kansas.
Des nouvelles de M. Hewitt ?
Non, c'est toujours la même info sur les
émeutes du camp ouest de Chicago.
Merci de faire équipe avec nous.
Jimmy, c'est le moins que je puisse
faire pour me rendre utile.
Chez vous, j'ai l'impression
d'être un poids inutile.
Vous plaisantez ?
Vous êtes la meilleure
hôte que je connaisse.
Vous faites la cuisine, la vaisselle,
et vous aimez jouer au Boggle.
On redoute le moment ou tout
s'arrangera avec votre mari.
Je ne voulais pas
paraître insensible.
- Désolé.
- Non, je comprends. Merci.
Écoutez...
je peux vous parler d'un truc ?
De quoi s'agit-il ?
Hier soir, Sam et Woody étaient...
en train de dessiner.
Sam a fait celui-ci.
Je ne voulais pas en parler devant
tout le monde à la maison,
je ne voulais pas être embarrassant.
Non, merci beaucoup de
me l'avoir montré.
Je ne suis pas psychologue,
mais ce garçon semble vraiment
avoir été traumatisé.
Il n'y a rien de surprenant.
30 millions de personnes sont
mortes il y a peu de temps.
Pour tous les enfants, ce doit
être difficile de l'accepter.
Surement, mais c'est tellement précis.
Les corps, la maison...
Je lui en parlerai quand
il reviendra de l'école.
- Merci.
- Pas de quoi.
Le sable empêche le
cuivre de s'oxyder.
D'où tenez-vous ça ?
Et bien...
comme toutes les choses marrantes,
et illégales que je connais...
de mon père.
Alors, Eric avait raison.
J'ai bien peur que oui.
Vous connaissez ce livre...
qui disait que...
les femmes viennent de Venus,
et que les hommes ont tort ?
Non pas que j'aie lu le livre,
mais j'ai...
jeté un coup d'oeil
à celui de Gail.
Il y est beaucoup question
d'hommes qui ont besoin de...
prendre du recul, et s'isoler
de temps en temps.
Je ne sais pas si c'est
vraiment dans ce livre, mais...
si un homme veut s'isoler,
il trouvera un moyen.
Peu importe...
les moyens, et les évènements
qui l'entourent.
Ouais, vous avez surement raison.
C'est surement de
cela qu'il s'agit.
Vous n'avez rien à vous
reprocher, Mary.
Ni personne d'autre.
Et je pense qu'Eric
en est conscient.
C'est grâce à cet endroit que
New Bern a pu s'en sortir.
Cette usine est le coeur
battant de la ville.
Regroupez toutes ces
turbines par là.
Shérif !
Qui est-ce ?
Un ami d'Heather, on l'a
rencontré à Black Jack.
Bonne nouvelle.
- Il sait où se trouve votre frère.
- Vraiment ? Où ?
Eric est rentré chez lui.
Lui et Heather...
Ils sont partis ce matin.
- Chez lui ? À Jericho ?
- Mais pourquoi ?
Ils auraient pu rentrer
avec les autres ?
Heather voulait lui parler
au moment du départ...
alors, ils sont partis sans eux.
Je leur ai prêté ma
voiture et mon fusil.
Tout semblait aller bien.
Ils sont surement déjà
à Jericho maintenant.
Bon.
- J'espère qu'ils vont bien.
- Merci.
- On doit quitter le bâtiment.
- D'accord.
Qu se passe-t-il ?
Il a fallu rénover les machines
après l'EMP, et...
une d'entre elles a surchauffé
et mis le feu au bâtiment.
Vous êtes satisfait ?
Ouais, le mystère
est éclairci.
C'est bon à entendre.
Dans ce cas, l'Adjoint Perkins
va vous reconduire.
Non, on n'a pas
besoin d'escorte.
C'est la règle.
Vous êtes intransigeants
sur les règles.
On a quasiment tout perdu après
le passage de Ravenwood.
Je suis intransigeant sur tout
ce qui nous maintient en vie.
- Merci.
- De rien.
Poussez le camion.
<i>Laissez-les passer.
- Franchement, tu y crois ?
- Pas du tout.
Et Ted non plus.
Il m'a passé ça en
me serrant la main.
- C'est une adresse, et...
- "Venez seuls"
On en a fini ici, alors ?
<i>Reculez.
<i>Laissez-les passer.
Je suis parti combien
de temps ?
Non, avant de répondre...
il est là depuis quand ?
- C'est très récent.
Ça ne fait pas si
longtemps que ça.
Je ne t'ai demandé
qu'une chose, Mimi.
Juste une !
Écoute-moi, Stanley.
Ta soeur n'est plus une gamine.
Tu ne peux pas ignorer leur
relation et virer Sean,
en pensant que ça sera fini.
Et tu peux me dire pourquoi ?
Parce que si tu fais ça...
elle s'accrochera encore
plus à cette relation.
Et si ça leur prend vraiment la tête,
comme tous les ados, ils s'enfuiront.
Au mieux, on les reverra dans 2 ou 3
jours quand ils seront à cours d'argent.
Mais par les temps qui courent...
on risque plutôt de retrouver leurs
corps sur le bord d'une route.
Écoute...
pour l'instant ça se passe ici.
Ça t'emmerde, je le sais,
mais c'est un emmerdement
gérable et sans risques.
Je te conseille de l'autoriser à rester,
avant que ça devienne bien pire.
Le camion de Perkins.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fout planté là
devant la caravane de Ted ?
On va lui demander.
Passe ton arme à mon copain et
on va rendre une petite visite à Ted.
Plus vite !
Où est mon frère ?
Je sais pas.
Demande-lui.
Il voulait me foutre en tôle
si je ne vous racontais pas ça.
- Et Eric ?
- Pas vu depuis des jours.
- Heather ?
- Elle est partie bosser ce matin.
Maintenant elle est
portée disparue aussi.
2 personnes disparues...
et personne ne sait rien ?
- Oh si, quelqu'un sait.
Hein ?
Où est-il ?
Va te faire foutre.
Du calme, Jake.
Il faut la jouer plus rusé.
Il nous faut des réponses.
Obtenir des réponses...
c'est assez facile.
Mais obtenir la vérité...
demande un peu
plus d'efforts.
Quand avez-vous vu Eric Green
pour la dernière fois ?
Écoutez...
c'est pas mes affaires.
C'est pas ce que
je vous ai demandé.
Pourquoi vous agissez comme si
on lui avait fait du mal ?
On a été attaqués.
Par qui ?
Les machines n'ont
pas surchauffé
ce matin, à l'usine.
C'est son frère...
et cette fille.
Il les ont sabotées.
Ils n'auraient pas fait ça.
Cette usine nous est autant
utile qu'à vous.
- Je les ai vus.
- Alors où sont-ils ?
Ils se sont enfuis.
Tu peux lui tenir les genoux ?
Écoutez,
pourquoi je surveillerais
le terrain de caravaning
si on les tenait, hein ?
Constantino a déclenché l'alerte.
Il a donné un SOS.
- SOS ? <i>[ Shoot On Sight ]</i>
- Tirer à vue.
Regardez-moi.
Il y a quoi dans cette usine ?
Je ne sais pas.
Non, je suis qu'un flic.
Demandez à Constantino.
Demandez à Constantino.
Il le sait ?
Regardez-moi.
- On va à l'usine.
- Mais Eric...
Je ne sais pas pour Eric.
On ne peut pas
fouiller toute la ville.
Alors on ferait mieux de découvrir
pour quoi il a risqué sa vie.
D'accord.
Tu as un endroit sûr où aller ?
Ouais, mon grand-père possède
une vieille cabane de chasse.
Emmène ce que tu possèdes d'important,
car tu ne reviendras pas.
Debout.
À genoux.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
- Mettez-vous à genoux.
- Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
C'est ça, ta manière ?
C'est toi qui m'as demandé de venir.
- T'allais faire quoi ?
- Tu veux la vérité ?
On en a eu qu'une partie.
Tu vois, j'ai...
assez d'expérience, Jake,
pour en savoir plus.
C'est la peur de la torture
qui donne des résultats.
La vraie torture
fonctionne que dans les films.
Il y avait ce type,
tellement maigre,
qu'on voyait ses côtes
à travers sa chemise.
Je lui donnais de la nourriture,
mais on avait plus grand-chose alors...
Puis un jour, j'ai...
vu dans son regard... qu'il...
il avait abandonné.
Je pensais pas être un jour si
contente de vivre dans une ferme.
À partir de maintenant,
je promets de ne plus me plaindre.
On a pas grand-chose, mais...
on en aura toujours assez, alors...
Mec, tout ce qu'il faut faire,
c'est rétablir internet.
Après, ça sera du gâteau.
Pourquoi ça ?
On pourra tout faire.
Élire un nouveau président,
construire une Maison-Blanche virtuelle,
écraser un avion dessus.
Des villes virtuelles...
- Tout sera nouveau.
- Ouais, mais...
où vas-tu trouver...
le matériel ?
Quel matériel ?
Je sais pas.
Nourriture, vêtements,
couverture, essence.
C'est pas un problème.
Dès qu'on aura internet,
y aura plus qu'à commander.
Tu sais Stanley,
tu n'as pas idée
comme Sean a été
utile pour le bétail,
la maison et...
tout en fait.
C'est vrai.
Ouais, c'est bizarre Stanley, car...
je suis plutôt un mec stylé.
C'est quoi un mec stylé ?
Tu sais...
Je veux dire,
je suis pas trop...
travail manuel.
Je suis plutôt le genre de mecs
qu'on fréquente pour son style.
Ma maison, mes règles, mon style.
Et toi, tu dors là.
Et alors, vers 3 h du matin,
y a cette torche qui m'éblouit.
Gail bondit de son côté du lit
pour attraper le téléphone
et appeler la Police quand finalement,
je trouve l'interrupteur.
C'était Eric,
qui se tenait là et qui dit :
"Avant d'aller dormir, fallait que je
vous avoue que je suis bourré."
J'ai répondu : "T'es quoi ?"
Il a dit : "Bourré."
"Ça n'arrivera plus.
Je ne sais pas ce qui m'a pris."
Pourtant, il paraissait
parfaitement sobre,
il articulait bien.
Gail l'a cuisiné. Il s'est avéré
qu'il avait bu une bière et demie.
Je lui dit :
"Fiston, t'as une idée..."
"du nombre de bières
nécessaires pour être bourré ?"
Il a répondu : "Non, aucune."
Je lui dis : "Alors, sors d'ici..."
"et me réveille pas
jusqu'à ce que tu le sois."
Il est parti,
Gail et moi avons eu un fou rire.
Elle ne rigole plus
beaucoup désormais.
Bon je divague un peu. On ferait
mieux de retourner à cet alambic.
Bonne idée.
Salut, mon pote.
Ta maman s'est absentée quelques
instants. Assieds-toi.
Tu peux nous laisser une minute ?
Bien sûr.
Bon, tu sais quoi ?
Pourquoi on n'irait pas dans mon
bureau, on pourrait discuter.
De quoi ?
De tes dessins.
Salut.
Je te présente Russell.
Il a sauvé nos fesses
à Black Jack.
Enchantée.
Je m'appelle Skylar.
Stevens, c'est ça ?
On peut t'aider ?
Je pense plutôt
qu'on peut s'entraider.
Vous avez une mine de sel
sans réel distributeur.
J'ai des hommes,
des camions, des armes,
mais pas de nourriture.
- Si on s'alliait...
- S'allier ?
Je demande la moitié
de ce qui t'appartient.
On se débrouille, maintenant.
Les gens de Jericho ne sont pas
les seuls à avoir besoin de sel.
J'ai erré un peu.
Je sais où aller, qui rencontrer,
et je sais comment revenir
ici un seul morceau.
Qu'est-ce qu'on y gagne ?
De gros bénéfices.
Là où je vais, vous pouvez
vous faire 5 fois plus qu'ici.
Et...
je négocierai avec
Gray Anderson pour vous.
Pour quand voulez-vous
une réponse ?
Avant que je parte,
dans la matinée.
Croyez-moi,
tout le monde y trouvera
son compte.
C'est un inventaire complet
des ressources de Jericho.
C'est notre mine.
Et notre ville.
Ils l'ont partagée, comme
si elle leur apppartenait !
Que savent-ils que
nous ignorons ?
Viens.
Chéri.
Que se passe-t-il ?
On a parlé de mes dessins.
Écoute, tu peux attendre dans
l'entrée un instant ?
Je dois parler à M. Taylor seule.
OK ?
Que faites-vous ?
Darcy, quelque chose se passe,
sans rapport avec les bombes.
Mon fils à assez de choses à
s'occuper, sans être...
brusqué ni interrogé.
S'il y a un problème avec lui,
je m'en chargerai personnellement.
D'accord.
Merci.
Pour quoi ?
De laisser Sean rester.
De rien.
Et pour ne pas le traiter
d'idiot même si c'en est un.
Ok, si tu sais que...
Désolé. J'avais juste un
chat dans la gorge.
Je ne voulais pas interrompre votre
moment de complicité fraternelle.
C'est bien ça, n'est-ce pas ?
Sean peut être idiot,
mais il peut aussi être super.
Tous les mecs sont comme ça,
il faut faire avec leur côté "idiot"...
pour avoir leur bon côté.
Vraiment ? Et d'où te vient ce
soudain éclair de sagesse ?
Qu'est ce qu'elle a dit sur moi ?
Quand a-t-il appris le
langage des signes ?
Il couche avec une sourde.
C'est ma soeur.
Je pense que si Sean Henthorn est
mon plus gros problème, alors
je suis un mec chanceux.
Tu veux être encore
plus chanceux ?
Que fais-tu ?
C'est un contrat... d'après l'avocat,
avec ça, je serai émancipée.
En déclarant vos parents morts ?
Ce n'est pas correct... en aucun cas tu
ne peux faire ça, c'est injuste.
- Oublie tout ça.
- C'est hors de question.
- C'est légal.
- Et...
quoi, tu vas aller en vélo jusqu'à
Topeka pour l'enregistrer, Dale ?
Oubliez que je suis le Maire.
Je te parle en tant qu'ami
de tes parents.
Mes parents auraient voulu
que j'aie ma part de la mine.
Tes parents vont revenir.
Et s'il s'avère que
ce n'est pas le cas,
alors je t'aiderai à
apprendre ce travail.
Et qui décidera que
c'est le moment ?
Vous ?
J'ai pris ma décision,
il n'y a donc plus de loi ?
Tu n'a pas pris de décision.
Tu as signé un bout de papier.
Souhaites-tu vraiment si fort
que tes parents soient morts ?
- Bon, arrêtez.
- Non.
Puisque tu la conseilles, lui as-tu
aussi dit comment ils sont morts ?
New York est intacte,
Donc je pense que tu as dû
être très imaginatif, non ?
Ont-ils été tués là bas ?
Ou ont-ils été tués
en revenant
vers l'enfant qui veut
tout leur prendre ?
C'est juste un bout de papier.
Viens.
Ils fabriquent des obus de mortiers.
C'est une usine d'armement.
<i>Dépechez-vous.
Constantino les veut pour ce soir.
<i>Ils seront prêts.
Ils se préparent pour
une guerre !
Il faut retourner en ville.
Non, il faut absolument
les arrêter. Couvre-moi.
<i>Il est parti par là.
Venez.
Lâche ça !
Donne-moi ça.
Désolé. Je crois que je suis en
retard pour le diner.
Ou le déjeuner.
Fais ton choix.
J'aidai Mary. Ça a pris plus de
temps que je le croyais.
Tu as dit à Eric qu'on
s'occuperait d'elle.
Ce que je voulais dire,
c'est qu'on la garderait en vie.
Ça ne voulait pas dire
qu'on la sortirait,
ou qu'on passerait notre
temps avec elle
chaque fois qu'elle a
besoin de réconfort.
Attends.
Tu ne penses pas qu'Eric est
parti à cause de moi ?
Si ?
C'est ce que tu penses ?
Je pense qu' Eric est parti pour
beaucoup de raisons...
mais Mary est peut être
celle qui le fera revenir.
Je ne veux pas avoir a
revenir dans cette maison.
Tu as pris tous tes jouets ?
Alors,
de quoi avez-vous
parlé avec M. Taylor ?
De rien.
Non, Sam, tu sais qu'on ne garde
aucun secret dans la famille.
Oui, je sais, bébé.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fiche ici ?
Je crois qu'on devrait parler.
Sam, chéri, tu peux monter dans ta
chambre chercher le dernier carton ?
Salut, petit.
Écoutez, je comprends que vous soyez
curieux à propos de ma famille.
Nous n'avons pas
beaucoup d'amis ici.
On ne s'exprime pas beucoup, mais...
si vous voulez poser des questions,
demandez-moi, OK ?
Laissez mes enfants.
Mais je pense que Sam essaye de nous
dire quelque chose avec ses dessins.
Quelque chose qu'il ne
peut pas formuler.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Il dessine un petit garçon
qui a peur...
parce que son père n'est
pas là pour le protéger,
lui ou sa famille.
Je lui ai dit qu'il
n'était pas seul.
Je sais ce que c'est que d'avoir
des parents séparés.
Je lui ai dit que j'avais
traversé la même chose, et...
je pense que je m'en
suis bien sorti, alors...
Je pense que vous vous en êtes
très bien sorti, Jimmy.
Je vous remercie.
Je vais retourner à la
maison maintenant.
On se voit là-bas.
Merci, Jimmy.
De rien.
- Comment ça avance ?
- Pas mal.
Toues les éoliennes ont été
montées sans problèmes.
Mer...
Merci.
Vous avez tenu vos promesses.
Même plus.
Je suis content que vous
le preniez ainsi,
parce que j'ai une autre
proposition à vous faire.
Nous avons besoin de sel.
Aucun problème. Je vais demander
à mes gars de charger vos camions.
Et bien, en fait...
je pensai vous aider à le vendre.
Nous pensions à un quart
des revenus de la mine.
C'est une idée de Constantino ?
C'est la raison de toutes
ces bonnes intentions ?
Non. Écoutez-moi.
On y trouvera tous notre compte.
Nos deux villes.
Si vous m'autorisez à vendre
du sel de la mine.
Je suis désolé.
Je suppose que vous et les jumeaux Olsen
pensez que c'est une sorte de faveur.
Et bien, pour ce que ça vaut,
ce serait une transaction légale.
On ne vend pas.
Vos gars à New Bern pensent
que ce serait bien.
- Peu m'importe ce qu'ils pensent.
- C'est bien dommage.
Quand j'ai vu cette...
carte de Jericho,
j'ai posé des questions
à Heather.
Elle ne pensait pas que...
New Bern pourrait
nous faire ça.
Alors elle a fouiné, et...
elle a vu les mortiers et...
leurs plans.
Écoutez, vous allez retourner
gentiment d'où vous venez.
Dan, viens ici !
M. le Maire, il y a beaucoup plus
en jeu que vous le pensez.
- Vraiment ?
- J'essaye de vous aider.
New Bern a difficilement
passé l'hiver.
Les gens savent que la nourriture
venait de chez vous.
Et ils savent aussi qu'il n'y en aura
jamais assez pour tout le monde,
alors ils commencent à se demander
ce qu'ils pourraient faire.
Alors ?
Emmène le plus d'adjoints
possible à la mine de sel.
Qu'elle soit sous bonne garde,
jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
Gray...
j'ai déjà des hommes là-bas.
Gray, écoute-moi.
Ce marché est valable.
Vous ne le réalisez pas encore,
mais, s'il vous plaît...
l'alternative n'est pas souhaitable.
Les rumeurs sur Jericho,
parlant de montagnes de nourriture,
du fait qu'il nous ont
envoyé Ravenwood...
ce ne sont peut-être pas
que des rumeurs.
Nous leur avons
rendu l'électricité,
et maintenant qu'ils ont
ce dont ils ont besoin,
ils n'ont pas l'intention de
tenir leur part du marché.
Pourquoi n'avez-vous pas
quitté la ville ?
Parce qu'on voulait
détruire leur matériel...
arrêter leur usine.
Et ils nous ont attrapés.
Ils m'ont jeté ici.
Et, où est-elle ?
Où est Heather ?
Elle est morte, Jake.
<i>Il ne leur suffit pas de
garder leur nourriture
Il ne leur suffit pas de
garder leur nourriture
et de nous laisser mourir.
Toi, lève-toi.
Toi aussi.
Ils veulent nous détruire.
<i>J'ai regardé leur Maire dans les yeux,
<i>je lui ai dit dans quelle situation
désespérée nous étions.
<i>Mais le jour
<i>où nous allions honorer
notre part du marché,
<i>qu'ont-ils fait ?
<i>Ils ont essayé de détruire l'usine
Ils ont essayé de détruire l'usine
qui nous fait tous vivre.
Voici les preuves.
Voici les fils de Johnston Green,
envoyés de Jericho pour semer
le chaos dans notre ville.
Maintenant nous savons,
que si ces gens avaient réussi,
New Bern aurait
cessé d'exister.
Avec votre aide,
et votre sacrifice,
je vais faire en sorte
que cela n'arrive jamais.

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Oh, my God, Ted.
- Jake, this is... Ted Lewis.
- Hey, how you doing?
We grew up together over in New Bern.
This is Russell and Mike.
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.
I'm gonna help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.
- You're just going to leave?
- Won't be for very long.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No, the question is: how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
- They get tired of you being sheriff?
- No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
Can we buy some more of these things?
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.
- We're going to need food.
- Won't see another crop till spring.
Spring crop is what I'm talking about.
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.
Starve next fall or freeze this winter.
Okay, look,
we'll give you the food.
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.
We're going to need ten Jericho
men to help us build them.
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?
I am not going to build
these things on credit.
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.
What you are about to do...
means this town's survival.
All right, let's move out.
If anything happens
to any of them...
you're the first one I come for.
I know.
<i>Hey, Jeff, they're back.
I didn't expect to see
you till spring, Russell.
I thought you might
be needing these.
Your windmills.
It's good to see our guys back, but...
it's going to take some time for me
to find the guys to replace them.
You don't need to replace them.
Well, now, wait...
our agreement was that
we got ten windmills
for ten percent of the crops.
You'll get your windmills,
but we don't need your men.
Constantino called it
an act of good faith.
I didn't think Constantino
knew that term.
But...
I'll take it.
Stanley!
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Where's Eric?
He didn't come back, Mary.
He said he wasn't ready.
But...
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Okay.
Thanks.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
- None of us did.
- How are you? You okay?
Where's Eric?
Come here.
He didn't come back with us.
Why not?
When I talked to him, he was still
pretty messed up about April's death.
He said he was thinking about
staying in New Bern for a while
to get his head together.
- When was this?
Three days ago.
Then, he didn't show up for work,
and I haven't seen him since.
I don't know what's
going on in New Bern.
When I asked about Eric,
they couldn't tell me anything.
Then, the cops started escorting
us wherever we went.
Then today, out of nowhere,
Russell says,
"Pack it up, we're going home",
like...
like it wasn't safe for us
there anymore.
Where's my brother?
- I don't know.
- What?
I know he hasn't been
seen for a few days.
Did you even try to find him?
- I asked Constantino.
- And?
And he told me that
they were looking for him.
And then this morning, he told me
to bring the rest of your guys home.
What the hell's going on
over there, Russell?
Should I be worried about him?
Answer me.
Should I be worried?
I would be.
- I'm going with you.
- No...
you've been gone for weeks.
Go home.
You need someone who knows
their way around New Bern.
I'll try to find Heather
as soon as I get there.
She knows it better than any of us.
Look, it's not safe out there.
You can't go by yourself.
I'm not.
I need your help.

You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china, Jake.
I got to try and find him.
I can't just...
There's something going on in that town.
I can feel it.
Stanley starts asking questions,
and they just send them home?
Okay, but you understand why
I can't just up and leave, right?
- He's my brother.
- And you said he was upset,
so maybe he just...
- If you're saying no, just say no.
Come on, Jake, I'm not saying no.
I'm saying we got to
understand the situation.
The situation is...
he's been missing for three days,
and I came to you...
for help.
Okay.
But if we do this,
we do it my way.
Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you're home.
I missed you guys so much.
You're totally back.
<i>Mrs. Green.
I'm really sorry to bother
you like this, but...
I thought you should know.
Know what?
The men came back from New Bern,
and Eric wasn't with them.
Why not?
He decided to stay a little longer.
Decided to or Constantino insisted?
Stanley talked to him.
He said...
he said he wasn't ready
to come home.
- How'd you hurt your hand?
- Oh, I just...
was trying to fix the copper
tubing on my still.
It just popped off and cut me.
Is alcohol really a priority right now?
Actually, it's not to drink.
I was trying to make antiseptic
for the med center.
I should go.
- You got any sand over there
at the bar?  - Sand?
Yeah, I think I can show you a way
around that copper tubing.
I'll just give you a hand.
See you in a bit.
Guys... yo, listen.
Stop unloading that.
Put that back.
What the hell is this?
- Salt.  - Who gave you permission
to take it from the mine?
51% of the mine belongs to me.
I just took it from my half.
You don't have a half...
of anything. Your parents do.
Look, I know you still think
of me as a child...
and I can't help it if that's
where you're stuck,
but the fact is I have
a right to what I own.
You are a minor and
you don't own anything
as long as your parents
are still alive.
Or do you have some information
that I don't have?
Look, just... just take
the salt back to the mine
and don't make me have to
send my guys to do it.
Proof of residence?
We're not from here.
Sorry, you're going to need
to turn this car around
and proceed back
the way you came.
I'm here to see my brother.
His name is Eric Green.
You're not hearing me, sir.
No one's allowed...
No, you're not hearing me.
I have to see him.
He came here as part of the deal
you made with Jericho. Now...
Hey, Jake...
I want to talk to Phil Constantino.
- Get out of the car.
- Hell, no.
Put your hands on the dashboard.
I want to see your hands.
That's Johnston Green's son.
Let him through.
I'll escort him in
to see Sheriff Constantino.
Go ahead, let him through.
<i>Mister, Mister.
Do you have any food?
I'm sorry, I don't...
I'm sorry, I don't have any.
All right, ma'am, come on.
Get those kids out of there.
Hey, come on.
<i>Come on, please.
I thought we had it bad.
What the hell happened here?
Ravenwood.
My brother is missing.
I know. I've got patrols
out looking for him.
- And no leads?
- No.
Sorry, I wish there's
more I could do.
You're the sheriff and the mayor.
You can do more.
I'm trying, Jake.
You sure Eric even
wants to be found?
What's that supposed to mean?
We all knew April.
We know what happened.
Last I heard that Eric was
having a tough time.
He'll be fine as soon as
we get him home.
You know what?
Let's face the facts.
He might have been attacked.
Could be lying in a
ditch somewhere.
- Why would you say...
- Take it easy!
The fact is some folks around here
aren't too fond of Jericho these days.
That's why I sent the workers home
today. When your brother went missing,
I got worried for their safety.
Why?
There's been a lot of rumors
flying around about your town.
What are people saying?
They're mad that Jericho didn't
warn us about Ravenwood.
They think you're going to renege
on your part of the food deal.
We've had it rough here, okay?
They're just looking for
somebody to blame.
- Where was Eric last seen?
- The factory.
End of his shift.
Look, we're just trying to help.
What is it that you want
that we're not giving?
I want to talk to Heather Lisinski.
<i>Take care of each other, Kansas.
Anything new from Mr. Hewitt?
No, it's just the same bulletin about
the riots in Chicago Camp West.
Hey, thanks for taking on a shift.
Jimmy, it's the least I can do
to make myself useful.
I feel like such a freeloader
sitting around your house all day.
You kidding me?
You're like the best houseguest ever.
You cook, you do the dishes, you
never get bored playing Boggle.
And we're dreading the day you
and your husband work things out.
That sounded a lot less
insensitive in my head.
- I'm sorry.
- No, I understand, thank you.
Listen...
can I talk you about something?
Yeah, what is it?
Last night Sam and Woody were
drawing pictures.
That's one of Sam's.
I didn't want to bring it up at
the house with everyone around,
I thought it might be upsetting.
No, I'm glad you showed
this to me.
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but that really looks like a kid
dealing with some kind of trauma.
I'm-I'm not surprised.
I mean....
30 million people died a few months ago.
I'll bet there's kids all over the
country still trying to process that.
Maybe, but it's so specific.
The bodies, the house.
He's coming by after school.
I'll talk to him then.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Sand keeps the copper from buckling.
How'd you learn this?
Well...
like... most things that
are fun and illegal...
from my dad.
So the stories Eric tells are true.
Afraid so.
You remember that book...
something about...
women are from Venus,
and men are wrong.
Not that I read the book, mind you,
but I did,  you know...
flip through Gail's copy of it.
Lot of stuff in there about
men needing to...
go off and hold up in
a cave sometime.
Now, I don't know if this was
actually in the book, but...
if men can't find a cave,
they'll make one.
Out of...
whatever circumstances happen
to be lying around.
Yeah, you're probably right.
I'm sure that's all it is.
This isn't your fault, Mary.
It wasn't anybody's fault.
I think Eric's figuring that out.
This place is the only reason New Bern
made it through the Depression.
The factory whistle's like
a heartbeat to this town.
Put the wind turbines binds
together just down here.
Sheriff!
Who's that?
It's a friend of Heather's.
We met him at Black Jack.
Good news.
- This guy knows where your brother is.
- Really? Where?
Eric went home.
He and Heather both.
They... left this morning.
- Home? To Jericho?
- Why would they do that?
Why didn't they go
with the convoy?
Well, Heather had to talk
him into going. So...
by then, the other guys had left.
So, I lent them my car
and my rifle.
They didn't seem worried at all.
Probably back in Jericho by now.
Right.
- Hope they're okay.
- Thank you.
- We got to clear the building.
- All right.
What happened?
We had to retrofit all the
machines after the EMP,
and one of them overheated.
Caught part of the building on fire.
You got what you need?
Yeah, mystery solved, I guess.
Good. Glad to hear it.
If there's nothing else, Deputy Perkins
will escort you out of town.
No. We don't need
to be escorted.
It's policy.
You're big on policy.
We almost lost everything when
Ravenwood came through here.
I'm big on anything that
keeps us alive.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Move the truck.
Let them through.
- You buying any of that story?
- Nope.
Neither was Ted.
Slipped me this when
he shook my hand.
- It's an address and...
- "Come Alone"
So, we done here?
<i>Back it up.
<i>Let them through.
How long have I been gone?
No, before you answer that,
how long has he been here?
- It's very recent really.
He hasn't been here that long.
I asked you to do one
thing for me, Mimi.
One thing!
You know, you listen
to me, Stanley.
Your sister is not a child anymore.
You can't just throw this fit
and kick Sean's ass
and think that's going
to be the end of it
I hope you're going to
explain why I can't.
Because if you do,
she's just going to latch
on that much tighter.
Unless they really get angry,
in which case, the age-old teenage
remedy is to run away,
which used to mean that they'd
hear from them in a couple of days
when they ran out of bus money.
Nowadays, chances are much better
that you'll find their bodies
on the side of a road.
Look...
right now it is under our roof.
And it's a pain in the ass, I know,
but it's a safe and manageable
pain in the ass,
and I suggest you let it stay here
before it turns into anything
more than that.
That's Perkins' truck.
What's he doing staking
out Ted's trailer?
Let's ask him.
Hand your gun to my friend,
and let's pay Ted a little visit.
Come on.
Where's my brother?
I don't know, ask him.
He threatened to throw me in jail this
morning if I didn't feed you that lie.
- So you haven't seen Eric?
- No. Not for days.
- What about Heather?
- She left for work this morning.
Next thing I know, they tell
me she's gone missing, too.
Two people disappear,
nobody knows anything?
Oh, somebody does.
Right?
Where is he?
Screw you.
Hey, come on, Jake,
we got to be smarter than that.
We need answers.
Getting answers...
is easy.
It's getting the truth...
that takes work.
When did you last see Eric Green?
Look...
this is not my thing.
I didn't ask you that, did I?
Why do you act like
we did something wrong?
We were attacked.
How do you figure that?
The those machines didn't overheat
this morning at the factory.
It was his brother...
and that girl.
They sabotaged it.
They would never do that?
We need that factory
just as much as you do.
- I saw them.
- If you saw them, then where are they?
They ran away.
Hold his knees, please.
Look,
why would I be staking out
a trailer park if we had them? Huh?
Constantino put us on alert.
He gave a SOS.
- SOS?
- Shoot on sight.
Look at me.
What is in that factory?
I don't know.
No, I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
Ask Constantino.
Ask Constantino.
He knows?
Look at me.
- We go to the factory.
- But Eric...
I don't know about Eric.
But we cannot search this whole town.
So we should go and see what it was
that he was risking his life for.
All right.
You got some place safe you can go?
Yeah, my grandfather has
an old hunting cabin.
You take what's important because
you are not coming back here.
Get up.
On your knees.
What is he doing?
- Down on your knees.
- What?
What are you doing?
Hawkins!
Is that doing it your way?
You asked me to come along.
- What were you going to do?
- You want the truth?
Less than you would have.
You see, I've done...
I've done enough, Jake,
to know better.
It's the fear of torture
that gets results.
Actual torture only works
in the movies.
And this one guy, he was
so skinny, you could
count his ribs through his shirt.
I tried to give him food when I could,
but none of us had much so...
And then one day, I could just...
see it in his eyes.
He'd, uh...
he'd given up.
I never thought I'd be so
thankful to live on a farm.
From now on, I promise
I'll only complain intermittently.
Well, we don't have much, but, uh...
we'll always have enough, so...
Dude, all they need to do
is get the Internet back up.
After that, it's a piece of cake.
Why is that?
Well, you could do anything.
I mean, you could run for president.
Make a virtual White House.
Fly a plane into that.
I mean, virtual cities and towns...
nothing to nuke.
- Yeah, but...
where would we get...
stuff?
What stuff?
I don't know.
Food, clothes, blankets, fuel.
Not a problem.
After the Internet is back up,
you just order all that stuff.
You know, Stanley,
you would not believe
how helpful Sean has been
around here with the livestock,
and the house,
and... just everything.
It's true.
Yeah, it's weird, Stanley, 'cause
I am much more of a vibe guy.
What the hell is a vibe guy?
You know...
I mean, I've never been into, like,
physical labor.
I'm more the guy that people
have around for my vibe.
My house, my rules, my vibe.
And you sleep there.
So anyhow, it's, like, 3:00 a. m.,
I've got this flashlight in my face.
Gail's over on her side of
the bed trying to find the phone
to call the cops and finally,
I located the light switch.
It's Eric,
who's standing there and he says,
"I can't go to sleep until
I confess I'm drunk. "
I said, "You're what?"
He said, "I'm drunk."
"It won't ever happen again.
I don't know what I was thinking."
Well, meantime,
he looks perfectly normal,
his speech isn't slurred or anything.
Gail starts grilling him. Turns out
he has had a beer and a half.
I said to him,
"Son, do you have any idea
how much beer it takes to get drunk?"
He said, "No, I don't. "
I said, "Well, get out of here and
don't wake me up again until you do."
He left, Gail and
I just could not stop laughing.
She doesn't laugh too much anymore.
Here I am rambling on. We probably ought
to go take a look at that still.
Good idea.
Hey, buddy.
Your mom just ran to the little
girls' room. Why don't you grab a seat?
Could you give us a minute?
Sure.
Say, you know what?
Why don't we go sit in my office,
maybe we can talk.
About what?
About your artwork.
This is Russell.
He saved our butts out
at the Black Jack.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm Skylar.
Stevens, right?
Something we can help you with?
Well, I was thinking
we could help each other.
You've got a salt mine
with no real distributor.
I've got men, trucks, guns,
but no supplies.
- If we become partners...
- Partners?
I'm asking for half
your share of the mine.
We're doing okay now.
Okay, but the people in Jericho,
they only need so much salt.
I've been out there.
I know the trade routes,
where to find the highest bidders
and how to make it
back here in one piece.
What's in it for us?
Bigger profits.
Where I'm going, I can get you
five times what you can make here.
And...
I'll deal with Gray Anderson for you.
When do you need an answer?
Before I leave in the morning.
Believe me,
this is good for everyone.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
It's our mine.
And our town.
They sliced it up like they own it.
What do they know that we don't?
Come on.
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?
We were talking about my drawings.
Look, do you mind waiting
in the lobby a minute?
I just need to talk to
Mr. Taylor alone. Okay?
What are you doing?
Darcy, something going on,
and it's not just about the bombs.
My son has enough to deal with,
you know, without
being poked and prodded.
If there's a problem with him,
I'll take care of it myself.
Right.
Thank you.
For what?
Letting Sean stay.
You're welcome.
And for not calling him an idiot
even when he is done.
Okay, if you know that...
Sorry. Just a little frog
in my throat.
Don't let me interrupt your nice
sibling-bonding moment.
That's what it is, right?
Sean can be an idiot,
but he can also be really great.
All guys are like that,
you have to put up with the
"idiot" stuff...
to get to the "great" stuff.
Yeah? And where did you come
by that litlle pearl of wisdom?
What did she say about me?
When did he learn how to sign?
He's sleeping with a deaf girl.
That's my sister.
I guess if Sean Henthorn is
my biggest problem, then
I'm a pretty lucky guy.
Want to get luckier?
What are you doing?
It's binding.
The lawyer said it makes me
an emancipated minor.
By declaring your parents dead?
This is wrong
in every way that
something can be wrong.
- Let's just forget about this.
- You can't do that.
- It's legal.
- So,
what, are you gonna pedal your little
bike to Topeka and file this, Dale?
Forget that I'm the mayor.
Okay, I'm speaking to you as
your parents' friend.
My parents would want me to have
my share of the salt mine
Your parents are coming back.
And if it turns out that
that is not true,
then I will help you learn the business.
And who decides when that happens?
You?
I mean my decision, are you saying
laws don't apply any more?
You didn't make a decision.
You signed a piece of paper.
Do you really want your parents
to be dead that badly?
- Okay, stop it.
- No.
You're advising her, Dale.
Did you also tell her
how her parents died?
Because New York survived,
so I guess you probably had
to get pretty creative, right?
Were they killed there?
Or were they murdered
on their way back
to the child who meant
everything to them?
It's just a piece of paper.
Come on.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're running a munitions factory.
Hurry up.
Constantino wants those tonight.
We'll have them ready.
They're getting ready for war.
We need to get back to town.
No, we need to try and stop them.
Cover me.
Hey, there he goes.
Down there.
Hold it!
Hand it over.
Sorry. I guess I'm late for dinner.
Or lunch.
Take your pick.
I was helping Mary.
It took longer than I expected.
You told Eric we'd take care of her.
What I meant was that
we'd help keep her alive.
What I didn't mean was that
we'd run over there
and spend the entire day
every time she needed
somebody to do
a little heavy lifting.
Wait.
You don't think
I'm the reason Eric left?
Do you?
Is that what you think?
I think Eric left for
a lot of reasons...
...but Mary may be why he comes back.
I don't want to have to come back
to this house again.
Did you get all the toys you want?
So,
what did you and Mr. Taylor
talk about today?
Nothing.
Now, Sam, you know we don't keep
secrets in this family.
Yeah, I know, baby.
What's he doing here?
I think we should talk.
Hey, Sam, honey,
why don't you go upstairs
to your room and
get that last box, okay?
Hey, buddy.
Look, I-I understand, you know,
you being curious about my family.
We haven't made a lot of friends here.
We just kind of keep to ourselves, but
if you want to ask any questions,
just talk to me, okay?
Leave my children out of it.
But I think Sam's trying to say
something with that drawing.
Something he can't put into words.
What do you mean?
He's drawing a little boy
that's afraid...
...because his dad's not
around to protect him
or his family.
I told him he's not alone.
I know what it's like to have
parents who have split up.
I told him
I'd been through it, and...
I think I turned out okay, so...
I think you turned out better
than okay, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.
So, I guess I'll head back
to the house then.
See you there.
Thank you, Jimmy.
Sure.
- How did it go?
- Good.
Turbines all went up without a hitch.
Thank...
Thank you.
You were as good as your word.
Even better.
I'm glad you see it that way,
because I have another
proposition for you.
We need salt.
Well, it's no problem.
I'll have my guys load up your truck.
Well, actually,
I mean to help you sell it.
We were thinking
a quarter stake in the mine.
Would we be Constantino?
Is that what all of
this good will was about?
No. Hear me out.
This will work for both of us.
For both of our towns.
If you agree to let me sell salt
from the mine.
I'm sorry.
I guess you and the, uh, Olsen twins
think this is kind of cute.
Well, for whatever it's worth,
we did conduct a legal transaction.
- Not for sale.
- Your people on New Bern
who think it should be.
- I don't care what they think.
You need to.
When I saw that
map of Jericho,
I asked Heather about it.
She didn't think
New Bern could do that to us.
Then she snuck in, and, uh...
she saw the mortars and...
their plans.
Look, you're going back to whatever
rock you crawled out from under.
Dan, get in here!
Mr. Mayor, there's a lot more
going on here than you realize.
- Is that so?
- I'm trying to help you.
Look, New Bern barely
survived the winter.
And the people there, they know
the food is coming from you.
And they also know that it's not going
to be enough to feed everyone,
and so, some of them, they're thinking,
what can we do about that
right now?
I want you to find every deputy you can
and get them up to the salt mine.
I want it under heavy guard
until further notice.
Gray, I've already got men up there.
Gray, listen to me.
This deal is a good thing.
I know you don't see it that way
right now, but please,
you do not want the alternative.
These rumors about Jericho,
about the food hoarding,
about how they sicced Ravenwood on us...
maybe they're not just rumors.
We restored their power supply,
and now that Jericho has what it needs,
it has no intention of making good
on its half of the deal.
Why didn't you just leave town?
'Cause we wanted to break the machine,
stop the factory.
Then they caught us.
They brought me here.
So, where is she?
Where is Heather?
She's dead, Jake.
But it's not enough for them
to keep their food
and leave us to starve.
You, up. You, too.
They want to see us destroyed.
I looked their mayor in the eye,
I told him how desperate
our situation was.
But on the day
that we made good
on our end of the deal,
what did they do?
They tried to destroy the factory
that keeps this town alive.
Here's your proof.
These are the sons of Johnston Green,
sent from Jericho to wreak
havoc on this town.
Now we know,
if these people had their way,
New Bern would cease to exist.
With your help
and sacrifice,
I will make sure that
that never happens.

- Jake.
- Maggie.
<i>Ils ont quelqu'un aux abords de la ville

Ils ont quelqu'un aux abords de la ville
qui se fait passer pour leur QG.
- Tout ça est réel ?
- Le flingue l'est.
Les mains en l'air !
Levez-les !
Tu es intelligente.
Enfuis-toi avant de te faire tuer.
Pour aller où ?
<i>Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les élections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
Ils en avaient marre
que tu sois shérif ?
Je suis toujours shérif.
J'ai juste plus d'autorité.
Ce truc fonctionne ?
On peut avoir du courant ?
Probablement dès demain.
Montons-la aussi vite que possible.
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
Vous possédez les seules mines
de sel à 650km à la ronde.
Nous avons besoin de nourriture.
<i>10 éoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la récolte.
C'est bon, on vous donnera
la nourriture.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
Ce que vous allez faire
est vital pour cette ville.
<i>Allez, allons-y.
Si quoi que ce soit leur arrive...
c'est toi que je viendrai
voir en premier.
Je savais pas que vous
reveniez aujourd'hui.
On n'était plus
en sécurité là-bas.
- Où est mon frère ?
- Pas vu depuis plusieurs jours.
<i>Tu ne peux pas aller à New Bern,
et faire ta petite guerre, Jake.</i>
Un inventaire complet des
ressources de Jericho.
Partagée, comme si
elle leur appartenait !
Ils fabriquent des obus de mortiers.
Ils se préparent pour
une guerre !
Lâche ça !
J'aime pas vraiment ça.
Ça va se terminer en fusillade.
Quand nos hommes arriveront,
qu'ils restent à distance.
Ces gars de New Bern risquent
d'avoir la gâchette facile.
Cette mine de sel est une
propriété privée !
Vous avez 30 secondes pour
dégager de là !
Qu'est ce que je t'ai dit, Ted ?
Désolé.
Je me doutais que
c'était toi.
Ouais, mais si ça n'avait
pas été moi...
tu venais de leur balancer
mon nom comme ça.
Je veux que tu me dises
qui est ton ami
et où je peux le trouver.
Ou ça risque de mal
tourner pour toi...
et ton frère, si tu ne nous
aides pas, Jake.
Et pourquoi je vous aiderais ?
Ce que je sais...
c'est que toi, ton ami et ton frère
avez été surpris en essayant de
saboter la seule usine de la ville.
Usine d'armes. Vous fabriq...
Donc je vais répéter
ma question :
Où est ton ami ?
Et si on parlait de ce qui est
arrivé à Heather Lisinski ?
Ramenez-le.
Viens, mon gars.
Ça va se savoir.
Ce que vous fabriquez va se
savoir à Jericho,
et vous ne pourrez rien
faire pour l'empêcher !
- Ça va ?
- Ouais.
- Ils ont été plutôt cool avec toi.
- Ouais, pour le moment.
Il n'ont toujours pas
trouvé Hawkins.
On va sortir d'ici.
Combien de personnes vont devoir mourir
avant que tu baisses les bras ?
Tu n'es pas responsable
de la mort d'April.
On ne sait même pas si elle est vraiment
morte avec tous leurs mensonges.
Je l'ai vue, Jake.
Je ne pense pas que
je pourrai rentrer.
Rester ici et te faire tuer,
ça ne te permettra pas de
te sentir mieux, crois-moi.
Tu te souviens de la fois
où je devais te...
réveiller pour la pluie de météorites ?
C'était censé être cette...
chose qu'on ne vit qu'une
seule fois dans sa vie.
Eh bien...
tu m'as tellement
envoyé balader,
que je t'ai finalement
laissé dormir.
Je ne te lâcherai
pas cette fois.
Je devrais vous faire
arrêter tout de suite !
Laissez-le tranquille. On a passé
un accord avec lui à New Bern.
Gray, c'est quoi ce bordel ?
Il n'y a pas d'accord !
On ne va rien vous donner !
Bon, on va y réfléchir.
Pour l'instant, on s'en va.
Non, on va pas partir
sans notre sel !
- On ne peut pas risquer que des gens
soient blessés.  - Elle a raison.
- Très bien, écoutez-moi...
- Vous faites quoi ?
Je ne vais pas laisser
des gens se faire tuer.
- C'était votre idée.
- Ça suffit !
Vire tes gars de là !

Il y en a beaucoup d'autres ?
Je ne sais pas, 6 ou 7.
Apportez des chariots.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Des types de New Bern
ont essayé de voler notre sel.
Il y a eu une fusillade.
Mon Dieu !
OK, Harry...
Harry, on va arranger ça, OK ?
Bon, vous voulez que
je regarde votre bras ?
Non, c'est bon.
J'attendrai.
Au lieu de soigner ces types,
on devrait les arrêter.
Ils ont ouvert le feu !
Ça, on en sait rien, OK ?
Je vais enquêter.
Pour le moment, assurons-nous
que personne ne meure.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Emmenez-le voir Kenchy...
tout de suite.
Vous avez de la glace ?
Elle s'est foulée la cheville.
Je vais bien.
Attends-moi.
Tiens bon, Harry.
Mme Carmichael,
est-ce qu'il va bien ?
Non, il ne va pas bien.
- Je ne voulais pas que ça arrive.
- Qu'est-ce que ça change ?
Tant que toi et ton copain avez ce que
vous voulez, peu importe les autres !
Ton père serait
vraiment fier de toi !
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Viens. Elle est juste
un peu nerveuse.
Caroline, jetez un oeil
à sa cheville, OK ?
T'en fais pas.
Gail, on a appris
pour la fusillade.
Je vous ai apporté
mon antiseptique.
Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire ?
Il me faut les constantes
de tous ceux qui arrivent.
Annie, montrez-lui
comment faire.
- Ça va retomber sur Eric ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Ils n'ont rien dit ?
Je vous ai dit que
je ne savais pas.
Johnston s'en occupe.
J'aurais besoin d'un rouleau
de gaze, et de pansements.
C'est sur le chariot,
près de l'ultrason.
Je ne sais pas à quoi
ça ressemble.
Laissez tomber.
Je vais le faire.
Que pensais-tu qu'il
se passerait ?
Il ne fallait pas
appeler les rangers.
Je protég...
Quoi ?
Je crains que l'on ait
notre premier mort.
Un type de New Bern...
Dawson.
Je ne connais pas son prénom.
Jim Dawson.
Laissez-moi retourner à New Bern
leur dire que vous êtes favorable
à cet accord sur le sel.
Hors de question.
S'ils pensent que
vous avez tiré en premier,
- Qu'on a quoi ?
- Allons, Gray.
On doit s'entraider tant
que c'est encore temps !
Les choses vont mal à New Bern.
Quand ils découvriront que
6 d'entre eux sont venus ici,
et que seulement 5 sont revenus...
Que veux-tu dire, Russell ?
Vous avez des hommes là-bas.
Vous devriez les ramener.
Eric est là-bas.
Johnston, tu dois savoir que...
Eric a disparu depuis quelques jours.
Hier, Jake est venu à sa recherche.
Tu me dis ça maintenant ?
En route. On peut y être
avant la tombée de la nuit.
- Non, non. Je ne suis pas...
- Tu l'as entendu ?
Constantino cherche à
envenimer les choses.
Mes fils ne lui serviront pas
de boucliers humains.
En avant !
Maggie ?
Comme on se retrouve, hein ?
Je t'avais pas reconnu
dans cette tenue.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Ils vous ont attrapés ?
C'était difficile de
continuer sans le tank.
On...
s'est dispersés après Jericho.
Je suis venue à New Bern
avec quelques types,
mais on s'est fait refouler
il y a quelques semaines.
J'ai été assez bête pour essayer
de revenir en douce.
Pourquoi ?
C'est l'enfer ici.
- C'est pire dehors.
- Vraiment ? Difficile à imaginer.
J'ai entendu que vous vous étiez
fait arrêter devant la Mairie.
Je ne veux pas t'effrayer, Jake,
mais vous devez fuir.
C'est pas si facile.
C'est possible si tu as
quelqu'un à l'extérieur.
Tu connais quelqu'un ?
Dehors ?
Non.
J'essaie juste d'aider.
La dernière fois,
tu as failli nous piquer
toutes nos réserves.
- Je voulais survivre.
- Ouais, nous aussi.
Je ne dis pas que
j'avais raison.
On avait quelque chose que les gens
voulaient et on l'utilisait.
C'est comme ça que ça marche.
Tu te sens inutile ici ?
C'est pas le cas.
Pas si tu as ce qu'ils veulent.
Qu'est-ce qui te fait croire ça ?
Je ne pense pas qu'ils vous
frappent pour le plaisir.
Même si je savais quelque chose,
je leur dirais rien.
T'as raison, tu ne dois pas.
Moi, je pourrais.
Non merci.
Écoute, si tu parles...
ils te remettront en cellule.
Il n'y aura aucun moyen
pour vous de sortir.
Mais si tu m'en parles, je pourrais
l'échanger contre ma liberté.
J'irai chercher de l'aide.
Quoi... me vendre
pour te laisser sortir ?
Et que je nous fasse
tous sortir de là.
Et que tu me ramènes à Jericho.
Je ne peux aller
nulle part sans toi.
Allez.
- Que faites-vous ?
- Debout !
Pourquoi vous l'emmenez ?
Il vous a déjà tout dit !
Comment ça se passe ?
Harry s'en sortira, mais...
je m'inquiète pour le personnel.
Tout le monde est épuisé.
T'es sûr de pouvoir conduire ?
Oui, oui, je vais bien.
Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
Sois prudent.
Si je vous perds tous les trois...,
je jure devant Dieu...
Je vais les ramener.
Dors un peu.
Faut que j'y aille.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Qu'est-ce que vous lui faites ?
Jake, donne-moi une chance.
On peut mettre fin à tout ça.
Il s'appelle Robert Hawkins.
Il a dit qu'il était sûrement
dans une cabane de chasse,
appartenant à un certain Ted Lewis.
Il travaille à l'usine.
Trouve cette cabane.
Tout de suite.
Vous êtes censé m'emmener.
Quoi ?
C'est... l'accord que j'ai passé
avec Constantino.
Je viens, et dès que vous le voyez,
vous me laissez au
poste de contrôle.
Demandez à Constantino.
C'est... il était censé être là !
Prends-la avec toi.
Si y a personne, tue-la.
C'est Johnston Green
de Jericho.
- Nous devons parler au shérif.
- Il est à la cabane.
Il a demandé à ne pas
être dérangé.
Ça mérite de le déranger.
Ce n'est pas vraiment Mayberry, si ?
Plus depuis Ravenwood.
Comment tu te débrouilles
avec un fusil ?
Je chassais le lièvre avant.
Sinon... j'ai jamais tué personne
si c'est ce que tu veux savoir.
On va retourner à l'usine.
Il nous faut des mortiers.
Et, pour quoi faire ?
On peut pas les lancer d'ici.
On ne va pas les lancer d'ici.
Phil.
Joli pied à terre que tu as là.
J'ai toujours voulu que
tu voies cet endroit.
Eh bien, j'aurais...
préféré que cela se fasse dans
de meilleures circonstances.
Je viens d'apprendre qu'Eric avait
disparu depuis quelques jours.
Tu peux m'en dire plus ?
Et il y a eu un incident
à la mine de sel...
plusieurs de nos gars ont été blessés.
Marchons.
<i>Je vais jeter un coup d'oeil.
<i>Je pars devant.
Tu la surveilles.</i>
<i>On y va.</i>
J'espère pour toi qu'il est là.
Cet accord pour la mine,
c'était ton idée ?
Je pensais pouvoir aider la ville,
en m'associant avec vous.
- Ça n'a pas vraiment marché, hein ?
- C'était...
maladroit de toute manière.
On espérait trouver
un arrangement.
C'est un peu tard, vous avez
tiré sur nos concitoyens.
- On ne sait pas qui a tiré.
- Allez...
une escouade de mecs armés
débarque en pleine nuit
pour voler notre sel.
Tu aurais fait quoi ?
Les agressions continues de
Jericho contre cette ville
sont inqualifiables.
- Quelles "agressions" ?
On est voisins,
nom de Dieu.
Je n'ai pas entendu ces voisins nous
prévenir de l'arrivée de Ravenwood.
Nous avons failli tout perdre en
essayant de nous défendre
contre ces mercenaires.
Nous ne pouvions pas deviner
où ils iraient après !
Vous auriez pu nous avertir !
Vous auriez pu nous aider quand ils
pillaient ce qu'il nous restait,
tuant ceux qui leur
barraient la route ?
Mes adjoints, mes amis ?
Et j'ai trouvé tes deux fils.
Tous deux dans mon usine
essayant de détruire notre
seule chance de survie...
Calme-toi.
Jake a été arrêté hier, alors
qu'il tentait de saboter l'usine.
C'est impossible.
L'usine fabrique des éoliennes.
Tes fils sont plutôt réfractaires
à cette idée.
J'ai arrêté Eric la veille,
pour la même raison...
nous les détenons tous les deux.
Maintenant tu vas m'écouter.
Je n'ai rien à foutre de ce dont
tu espères nous accuser...
mais si le moindre mal est
fait à l'un de mes garçons,
ça va mal se terminer.
Ça fait longtemps que les
choses tournent mal...
Je veux voir mes garçons.
Maintenant.
Pourquoi ils mettent
autant de temps ?
Qui êtes-vous?
- Ne tirez pas !
- Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis avec Jake.
- Columbus ! Columbus !
- Que dites-vous ?
Jake a dit qu'en vous parlant de
Columbus vous comprendriez.
J'étais avec lui en prison.
Il m'a envoyée pour vous aider !
Columbus, Columbus.
J'ai compris.
Comment va Jake ?
Il va bien.
Vraiment ?
C'est Ted.
Il est avec moi.
Je suis Maggie.
Jake m'envoie.
Où sont les flics ?
On s'en est occupés.
N'allez pas là-bas.
Voilà, tout y est.
Alors, quel est le plan ?
Le plan ?
Il va y avoir une
explosion en ville.
Ça devrait créer
assez de confusion
pour qu'on puisse sortir
Jake et Eric de là.
Je pense pouvoir vous aider.
J'ai un accord avec Constantino.
Allez. Lève-toi.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Je ne leur ai rien dit.
Mais je leur ai déjà donné Hawkins.
Ça n'a rien à voir
avec Hawkins.
Ils voulaient des infos
sur Jericho.
Comment sont nos défenses...
si nous avons des hommes...
où ils sont postés...
si nous avons une
réserve d'armes...
On doit y retourner.
Il faut les prévenir.
On va le faire.
On va pas crever ici.
Je vais m'en aller.
Merci pour ton aide.
Je t'en prie.
Tu devrais te reposer un peu.
Je le ferai...
Écoute...
je suis désolée d'avoir été
un peu brusque tout à l'heure.
On est tous sous pression.
Mary fait de son mieux...
peut-être pourrais-tu
lui donner une chance.
Ouais, je sais.
C'est... cet endroit.
April était chez elle, ici.
Elle me manque tellement.
Je sais. Ce n'est pas juste.
Pour ce que ça vaut...
toi et Mary avez
beaucoup en commun.
Quoi ?
Notre amour pour Eric ?
Non. Je pensais plutôt...
à votre... rude caractère.
Vous êtes... assez entêtées.
Dans un combat de bar...
vous seriez à armes égales.
- Tout va bien ici ?
- Très bien.
Tu devrais pas faire
attention à ta cheville ?
C'est pas comme si j'avais
reçu une balle.
- Skylar, ce n'était pas notre faute.
- Je sais. C'est juste que...
je comprends pas pourquoi
subitement,
on me balance à la figure
toutes ces critiques sur mon père.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
En particulier de la part des gens
censés être ses amis.
- Pas si proches que ça.
- Les Carmichael étaient invités...
tous les 15 jours pour dîner.
On partait en vacances ensemble.
Comment pouvaient-ils,
s'ils le détestait ?
Ils ne le détestent pas.
Ils sont peut-être juste effrayés.
Mon père était un homme bon.
Il leur a donné de l'argent pour
l'horloge de la rue principale.
Il a fait plein de bonnes actions.
Peut-être,
mais ce n'était pas pour ça
qu'ils étaient gentils avec lui.
Ils étaient gentils avec lui
parce qu'il avait du pouvoir.
Ça marche comme ça.
On est arrivés à l'usine.
Vous êtes prêts ?
Il va falloir surveiller
les gardes, là-bas.
Ted, prépare-toi à
les éliminer.
Je devais pas juste conduire ?
Il faut surveiller les gardes pendant
que je fais sortir Jake et Eric.
Surveille-les jusqu'à mon retour.
Et si besoin est...
tire sur le sniper en premier.
Vous savez ce que je
faisais il y a 5 mois ?
Du tuning sur mon camion !
Je me préparais à
présenter mon mémoire.
Littérature russe.
Et vous ? Qu'est-ce que vous faisiez
quand tout était encore normal ?
Je ne me rappelle même plus.
Tout le monde est prêt ?
Comment saura-t-on que
vous avez fini là-bas ?
Vous saurez.
J'attendrai ici.
Russell, ce ne sont pas tes fils.
Tu peux rentrer chez toi.
On peut tout arranger.
Ça ne peut pas finir comme ça.
J'ai le sentiment que
ça ne fait que commencer.
Tu sais que tu peux venir
à Jericho si tu veux.
Ma famille est ici...
une petite fille.
C'est chez nous.
Et je suis sûr qu'en restant ici,
on pourra tout arranger.
Si ça tourne mal, suivez la voie
de chemin de fer vers l'est.
Je vous emmènerai vers la route 70,
vous pourrez éviter le contrôle.
Merci, Russell.
Bonne chance.
- Nous allons devoir remettre ça.
- Quoi ?
Mon adjoint pense que ce n'est pas
vraiment le moment. Reviens demain.
Je ne partirai pas sans
avoir vu mes fils, Phil !
Écoute-moi bien...
tu laisses revenir tous ceux qui ont
été blessés à Jéricho cette nuit,
et je t'accorderai 15 minutes
avec tes fils.
Ne compte pas là-dessus.
Allons-y, M. Green.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Nous allons vous escorter
jusqu'au poste de contrôle.
Montez dans la voiture,
s'il vous plait... M. Green.
<i>Il n'en reste plus que deux.
<i>Doucement...
Les mortiers sont prêts.
Tu peux y aller.
Debout !
Ne tirez pas !
Je suis envoyée pour ramener
le gars de Jericho !
Il a essayé de me tuer.
Je dois immédiatement parler
à Constantino, s'il vous plaît.
<i>Constantino, je te répète juste
ce qu'il m'a dit...
<i>Il doit se diriger vers l'usine
pour la faire sauter, et...
<i>ensuite il va...
faire sauter la Mairie.
<i>pour libérer Jake et Eric.
- Tu veux me faire croire
qu'il a piégé un bâtiment surveillé
24/24 par des hommes armés ?
Je te répète juste ce qu'il m'a dit.
J'essaye de t'aider,
laisse-moi rester en ville.
- Ne me garde pas ici !
- Crois-tu que j'ai oublié
la façon dont tu as trahi tes amis
quand nous t'avons amené ici ?
Je ne crois pas un mot
venant de toi.
Faites-le sortir d'ici.
Vous voulez quoi ?
Allez, on vous a
déjà tout dit.
Qu'attendez-vous de nous ?
- Je vous ai déjà tout dit.
- Peut-être bien,
mais peut-être que ton
frère sera un peu plus...
plus compréhensif...
si il pense que ça
sauvera ta vie.
Laissez-le !
Laissez-le !
<i>Ouvrez le barrage
et laissez-le passer.
- Laissez-le.
- Parle-moi !
Laissez-le !
Combien de routes sont
minées autour de Jericho ?
- Je ne sais pas !
- Tu sais quoi ?
Comment avez-vous vaincu
Ravenwood ? Dis-moi !
- Dis-le-moi !
- Eric, regarde-moi !
- Ne lui dis rien !
- Combien d'espions avez-vous ici ?
Dis-nous ce que tu sais
ou on lui tranche la gorge.
Laisse-le partir, Perkins !
C'était quoi ça ?
Venez !
Il y a eu une explosion à l'usine.
- Emmenez-les à l'entrepôt.
- Et les autres ?
Seulement eux, maintenant !
Détachez-les.
Allez, détachez-les !
Allez !
Plus vite !
Et merde !
Où tu allais ?
Dans le...
dans le camion.
Tu devais attendre ici
jusqu'à mon retour.
Je sais.
Respire.
Détends-toi.
Tout ira bien.
Je peux pas faire ça.
Je suis désolé, non...
je peux pas.
Je suis désolé.
Lève-toi !
- Ça va ?
- Je vais bien.
Jake, attention !
Par ici !
On y va !
Allez ! Debout !
Viens !
<i>Arrivage: patates, viande.
Troc à l'intérieur.
Merci, Wayne.
Avec le reste dans l'allée 4.
Je peux vous aider,
Mme Carmichael ?
On m'a dit que vous
aviez de la viande.
Une jument de M. Henderson
s'est cassée la jambe,
mais elle s'en est remise.
J'en prendrai 125 grammes.
Voilà 500 grammes de grain.
Ça ne sera pas suffisant.
Mais c'est ce qui est écrit :
2 Kg de grain...
pour 1 Kg de viande.
Le prix a augmenté.
Désolé.
Je vous en prie.
C'est pour Harry. Le docteur
dit qu'il a besoin de protéines.
C'est toi qui vois.
Mon père était un homme bon,
Mme Carmichael.
Oui, il l'était.
Il y a 125 grammes.
Merci.
C'est fermé !
Je voulais juste
vous rendre ceci.
- L'antiseptique nous a bien aidés.
- Merci.
J'ai pu en refaire.
On va le prendre.
Alors, personne dans cette ville
ne veut boire un coup ce soir ?
On pourrait penser que les gens viennent
ici pour l'ambiance ou l'hospitalité...
mais c'est l'alcool...
Ils reviendront quand
j'aurai fait de la vodka.
Merci.
Comment ça se passe en ville ?
Eh bien...
ça s'est calmé.
On a dû mettre fin à
pas mal de grabuge.
Tout ce cirque avec New Bern
a rendu les gens nerveux.
J'ai parlé à Gray.
Il dit que s'ils ne sont pas revenus
à l'aube, alors il ira lui-même.
Alors, ça sera une longue nuit.
Si vous voulez... rester,
écouter la musique ou...
Je pense que je vais rentrer
chez moi et les attendre.
Si j'entends quoi que ce soit...
je vous le ferai savoir.
Moi aussi.
Bonne nuit, Mary.
Je ne pensais pas aller si loin
avec l'essence qu'on avait.
On... a 12 Km à faire, et...
je ne pense pas
qu'elle pourra tenir.
On va essayer.
Elle nous a pas abandonnés.
On ne l'abandonne pas.
Ton couteau.
- Comment va ton épaule ?
- Ça me...
fait mal à hurler.
C'est bon.
Comment tu t'en sors ?
Je marche toujours.
Ouais.
C'est du vrai whiskey.
Ouais, c'en est vraiment.
- J'en planque juste pour les urgences.
- Ça m'étonne pas.
À quoi tu penses ?
C'est pas une pluie
de météorites, mais...
Merci d'être venu me chercher.
Tu sens ça ?
Les premiers blés
commencent à pousser.
Ça a toujours été ma période
préférée de l'année.
Écoutez ce vent.
Il souffle toujours, même
après ce que nous avons fait.
Et tout ce qui va arriver...
Il faut continuer.

<i>Précédemment dans</i> Jericho
<i>Nous sommes des Marines américains,

- Caporal Mullin.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
<i>Ils ont quelqu'un aux abords de la ville

Ils ont quelqu'un aux abords de la ville
qui se fait passer pour leur QG.
- Tout ça est réel ?
- Le flingue l'est.
Les mains en l'air !
Levez-les !
Tu es intelligente.
Enfuis-toi avant de te faire tuer.
Pour aller où ?
<i>Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les élections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
Ils en avaient marre
que tu sois shérif ?
Je suis toujours shérif.
J'ai juste plus d'autorité.
Ce truc fonctionne ?
On peut avoir du courant ?
Probablement dès demain.
Montons-la aussi vite que possible.
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
Vous possédez les seules mines
de sel à 650km à la ronde.
Nous avons besoin de nourriture.
<i>10 éoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la récolte.
C'est bon, on vous donnera
la nourriture.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
Ce que vous allez faire
est vital pour cette ville.
<i>Allez, allons-y.
Si quoi que ce soit leur arrive...
c'est toi que je viendrai
voir en premier.
Je savais pas que vous
reveniez aujourd'hui.
On n'était plus
en sécurité là-bas.
- Où est mon frère ?
- Pas vu depuis plusieurs jours.
<i>Tu ne peux pas aller à New Bern,
et faire ta petite guerre, Jake.</i>
Un inventaire complet des
ressources de Jericho.
Partagée, comme si
elle leur appartenait !
Ils fabriquent des obus de mortiers.
Ils se préparent pour
une guerre !
Lâche ça !
J'aime pas vraiment ça.
Ça va se terminer en fusillade.
Quand nos hommes arriveront,
qu'ils restent à distance.
Ces gars de New Bern risquent
d'avoir la gâchette facile.
Cette mine de sel est une
propriété privée !
Vous avez 30 secondes pour
dégager de là !
Qu'est ce que je t'ai dit, Ted ?
Désolé.
Je me doutais que
c'était toi.
Ouais, mais si ça n'avait
pas été moi...
tu venais de leur balancer
mon nom comme ça.
Je veux que tu me dises
qui est ton ami
et où je peux le trouver.
Ou ça risque de mal
tourner pour toi...
et ton frère, si tu ne nous
aides pas, Jake.
Et pourquoi je vous aiderais ?
Ce que je sais...
c'est que toi, ton ami et ton frère
avez été surpris en essayant de
saboter la seule usine de la ville.
Usine d'armes. Vous fabriq...
Donc je vais répéter
ma question :
Où est ton ami ?
Et si on parlait de ce qui est
arrivé à Heather Lisinski ?
Ramenez-le.
Viens, mon gars.
Ça va se savoir.
Ce que vous fabriquez va se
savoir à Jericho,
et vous ne pourrez rien
faire pour l'empêcher !
- Ça va ?
- Ouais.
- Ils ont été plutôt cool avec toi.
- Ouais, pour le moment.
Il n'ont toujours pas
trouvé Hawkins.
On va sortir d'ici.
Combien de personnes vont devoir mourir
avant que tu baisses les bras ?
Tu n'es pas responsable
de la mort d'April.
On ne sait même pas si elle est vraiment
morte avec tous leurs mensonges.
Je l'ai vue, Jake.
Je ne pense pas que
je pourrai rentrer.
Rester ici et te faire tuer,
ça ne te permettra pas de
te sentir mieux, crois-moi.
Tu te souviens de la fois
où je devais te...
réveiller pour la pluie de météorites ?
C'était censé être cette...
chose qu'on ne vit qu'une
seule fois dans sa vie.
Eh bien...
tu m'as tellement
envoyé balader,
que je t'ai finalement
laissé dormir.
Je ne te lâcherai
pas cette fois.
Je devrais vous faire
arrêter tout de suite !
Laissez-le tranquille. On a passé
un accord avec lui à New Bern.
Gray, c'est quoi ce bordel ?
Il n'y a pas d'accord !
On ne va rien vous donner !
Bon, on va y réfléchir.
Pour l'instant, on s'en va.
Non, on va pas partir
sans notre sel !
- On ne peut pas risquer que des gens
soient blessés.  - Elle a raison.
- Très bien, écoutez-moi...
- Vous faites quoi ?
Je ne vais pas laisser
des gens se faire tuer.
- C'était votre idée.
- Ça suffit !
Vire tes gars de là !

Il y en a beaucoup d'autres ?
Je ne sais pas, 6 ou 7.
Apportez des chariots.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Des types de New Bern
ont essayé de voler notre sel.
Il y a eu une fusillade.
Mon Dieu !
OK, Harry...
Harry, on va arranger ça, OK ?
Bon, vous voulez que
je regarde votre bras ?
Non, c'est bon.
J'attendrai.
Au lieu de soigner ces types,
on devrait les arrêter.
Ils ont ouvert le feu !
Ça, on en sait rien, OK ?
Je vais enquêter.
Pour le moment, assurons-nous
que personne ne meure.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Emmenez-le voir Kenchy...
tout de suite.
Vous avez de la glace ?
Elle s'est foulée la cheville.
Je vais bien.
Attends-moi.
Tiens bon, Harry.
Mme Carmichael,
est-ce qu'il va bien ?
Non, il ne va pas bien.
- Je ne voulais pas que ça arrive.
- Qu'est-ce que ça change ?
Tant que toi et ton copain avez ce que
vous voulez, peu importe les autres !
Ton père serait
vraiment fier de toi !
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Viens. Elle est juste
un peu nerveuse.
Caroline, jetez un oeil
à sa cheville, OK ?
T'en fais pas.
Gail, on a appris
pour la fusillade.
Je vous ai apporté
mon antiseptique.
Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire ?
Il me faut les constantes
de tous ceux qui arrivent.
Annie, montrez-lui
comment faire.
- Ça va retomber sur Eric ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Ils n'ont rien dit ?
Je vous ai dit que
je ne savais pas.
Johnston s'en occupe.
J'aurais besoin d'un rouleau
de gaze, et de pansements.
C'est sur le chariot,
près de l'ultrason.
Je ne sais pas à quoi
ça ressemble.
Laissez tomber.
Je vais le faire.
Que pensais-tu qu'il
se passerait ?
Il ne fallait pas
appeler les rangers.
Je protég...
Quoi ?
Je crains que l'on ait
notre premier mort.
Un type de New Bern...
Dawson.
Je ne connais pas son prénom.
Jim Dawson.
Laissez-moi retourner à New Bern
leur dire que vous êtes favorable
à cet accord sur le sel.
Hors de question.
S'ils pensent que
vous avez tiré en premier,
- Qu'on a quoi ?
- Allons, Gray.
On doit s'entraider tant
que c'est encore temps !
Les choses vont mal à New Bern.
Quand ils découvriront que
6 d'entre eux sont venus ici,
et que seulement 5 sont revenus...
Que veux-tu dire, Russell ?
Vous avez des hommes là-bas.
Vous devriez les ramener.
Eric est là-bas.
Johnston, tu dois savoir que...
Eric a disparu depuis quelques jours.
Hier, Jake est venu à sa recherche.
Tu me dis ça maintenant ?
En route. On peut y être
avant la tombée de la nuit.
- Non, non. Je ne suis pas...
- Tu l'as entendu ?
Constantino cherche à
envenimer les choses.
Mes fils ne lui serviront pas
de boucliers humains.
En avant !
Maggie ?
Comme on se retrouve, hein ?
Je t'avais pas reconnu
dans cette tenue.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Ils vous ont attrapés ?
C'était difficile de
continuer sans le tank.
On...
s'est dispersés après Jericho.
Je suis venue à New Bern
avec quelques types,
mais on s'est fait refouler
il y a quelques semaines.
J'ai été assez bête pour essayer
de revenir en douce.
Pourquoi ?
C'est l'enfer ici.
- C'est pire dehors.
- Vraiment ? Difficile à imaginer.
J'ai entendu que vous vous étiez
fait arrêter devant la Mairie.
Je ne veux pas t'effrayer, Jake,
mais vous devez fuir.
C'est pas si facile.
C'est possible si tu as
quelqu'un à l'extérieur.
Tu connais quelqu'un ?
Dehors ?
Non.
J'essaie juste d'aider.
La dernière fois,
tu as failli nous piquer
toutes nos réserves.
- Je voulais survivre.
- Ouais, nous aussi.
Je ne dis pas que
j'avais raison.
On avait quelque chose que les gens
voulaient et on l'utilisait.
C'est comme ça que ça marche.
Tu te sens inutile ici ?
C'est pas le cas.
Pas si tu as ce qu'ils veulent.
Qu'est-ce qui te fait croire ça ?
Je ne pense pas qu'ils vous
frappent pour le plaisir.
Même si je savais quelque chose,
je leur dirais rien.
T'as raison, tu ne dois pas.
Moi, je pourrais.
Non merci.
Écoute, si tu parles...
ils te remettront en cellule.
Il n'y aura aucun moyen
pour vous de sortir.
Mais si tu m'en parles, je pourrais
l'échanger contre ma liberté.
J'irai chercher de l'aide.
Quoi... me vendre
pour te laisser sortir ?
Et que je nous fasse
tous sortir de là.
Et que tu me ramènes à Jericho.
Je ne peux aller
nulle part sans toi.
Allez.
- Que faites-vous ?
- Debout !
Pourquoi vous l'emmenez ?
Il vous a déjà tout dit !
Comment ça se passe ?
Harry s'en sortira, mais...
je m'inquiète pour le personnel.
Tout le monde est épuisé.
T'es sûr de pouvoir conduire ?
Oui, oui, je vais bien.
Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
Sois prudent.
Si je vous perds tous les trois...,
je jure devant Dieu...
Je vais les ramener.
Dors un peu.
Faut que j'y aille.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Qu'est-ce que vous lui faites ?
Jake, donne-moi une chance.
On peut mettre fin à tout ça.
Il s'appelle Robert Hawkins.
Il a dit qu'il était sûrement
dans une cabane de chasse,
appartenant à un certain Ted Lewis.
Il travaille à l'usine.
Trouve cette cabane.
Tout de suite.
Vous êtes censé m'emmener.
Quoi ?
C'est... l'accord que j'ai passé
avec Constantino.
Je viens, et dès que vous le voyez,
vous me laissez au
poste de contrôle.
Demandez à Constantino.
C'est... il était censé être là !
Prends-la avec toi.
Si y a personne, tue-la.
C'est Johnston Green
de Jericho.
- Nous devons parler au shérif.
- Il est à la cabane.
Il a demandé à ne pas
être dérangé.
Ça mérite de le déranger.
Ce n'est pas vraiment Mayberry, si ?
Plus depuis Ravenwood.
Comment tu te débrouilles
avec un fusil ?
Je chassais le lièvre avant.
Sinon... j'ai jamais tué personne
si c'est ce que tu veux savoir.
On va retourner à l'usine.
Il nous faut des mortiers.
Et, pour quoi faire ?
On peut pas les lancer d'ici.
On ne va pas les lancer d'ici.
Phil.
Joli pied à terre que tu as là.
J'ai toujours voulu que
tu voies cet endroit.
Eh bien, j'aurais...
préféré que cela se fasse dans
de meilleures circonstances.
Je viens d'apprendre qu'Eric avait
disparu depuis quelques jours.
Tu peux m'en dire plus ?
Et il y a eu un incident
à la mine de sel...
plusieurs de nos gars ont été blessés.
Marchons.
<i>Je vais jeter un coup d'oeil.
<i>Je pars devant.
Tu la surveilles.</i>
<i>On y va.</i>
J'espère pour toi qu'il est là.
Cet accord pour la mine,
c'était ton idée ?
Je pensais pouvoir aider la ville,
en m'associant avec vous.
- Ça n'a pas vraiment marché, hein ?
- C'était...
maladroit de toute manière.
On espérait trouver
un arrangement.
C'est un peu tard, vous avez
tiré sur nos concitoyens.
- On ne sait pas qui a tiré.
- Allez...
une escouade de mecs armés
débarque en pleine nuit
pour voler notre sel.
Tu aurais fait quoi ?
Les agressions continues de
Jericho contre cette ville
sont inqualifiables.
- Quelles "agressions" ?
On est voisins,
nom de Dieu.
Je n'ai pas entendu ces voisins nous
prévenir de l'arrivée de Ravenwood.
Nous avons failli tout perdre en
essayant de nous défendre
contre ces mercenaires.
Nous ne pouvions pas deviner
où ils iraient après !
Vous auriez pu nous avertir !
Vous auriez pu nous aider quand ils
pillaient ce qu'il nous restait,
tuant ceux qui leur
barraient la route ?
Mes adjoints, mes amis ?
Et j'ai trouvé tes deux fils.
Tous deux dans mon usine
essayant de détruire notre
seule chance de survie...
Calme-toi.
Jake a été arrêté hier, alors
qu'il tentait de saboter l'usine.
C'est impossible.
L'usine fabrique des éoliennes.
Tes fils sont plutôt réfractaires
à cette idée.
J'ai arrêté Eric la veille,
pour la même raison...
nous les détenons tous les deux.
Maintenant tu vas m'écouter.
Je n'ai rien à foutre de ce dont
tu espères nous accuser...
mais si le moindre mal est
fait à l'un de mes garçons,
ça va mal se terminer.
Ça fait longtemps que les
choses tournent mal...
Je veux voir mes garçons.
Maintenant.
Pourquoi ils mettent
autant de temps ?
Qui êtes-vous?
- Ne tirez pas !
- Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis avec Jake.
- Columbus ! Columbus !
- Que dites-vous ?
Jake a dit qu'en vous parlant de
Columbus vous comprendriez.
J'étais avec lui en prison.
Il m'a envoyée pour vous aider !
Columbus, Columbus.
J'ai compris.
Comment va Jake ?
Il va bien.
Vraiment ?
C'est Ted.
Il est avec moi.
Je suis Maggie.
Jake m'envoie.
Où sont les flics ?
On s'en est occupés.
N'allez pas là-bas.
Voilà, tout y est.
Alors, quel est le plan ?
Le plan ?
Il va y avoir une
explosion en ville.
Ça devrait créer
assez de confusion
pour qu'on puisse sortir
Jake et Eric de là.
Je pense pouvoir vous aider.
J'ai un accord avec Constantino.
Allez. Lève-toi.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Je ne leur ai rien dit.
Mais je leur ai déjà donné Hawkins.
Ça n'a rien à voir
avec Hawkins.
Ils voulaient des infos
sur Jericho.
Comment sont nos défenses...
si nous avons des hommes...
où ils sont postés...
si nous avons une
réserve d'armes...
On doit y retourner.
Il faut les prévenir.
On va le faire.
On va pas crever ici.
Je vais m'en aller.
Merci pour ton aide.
Je t'en prie.
Tu devrais te reposer un peu.
Je le ferai...
Écoute...
je suis désolée d'avoir été
un peu brusque tout à l'heure.
On est tous sous pression.
Mary fait de son mieux...
peut-être pourrais-tu
lui donner une chance.
Ouais, je sais.
C'est... cet endroit.
April était chez elle, ici.
Elle me manque tellement.
Je sais. Ce n'est pas juste.
Pour ce que ça vaut...
toi et Mary avez
beaucoup en commun.
Quoi ?
Notre amour pour Eric ?
Non. Je pensais plutôt...
à votre... rude caractère.
Vous êtes... assez entêtées.
Dans un combat de bar...
vous seriez à armes égales.
- Tout va bien ici ?
- Très bien.
Tu devrais pas faire
attention à ta cheville ?
C'est pas comme si j'avais
reçu une balle.
- Skylar, ce n'était pas notre faute.
- Je sais. C'est juste que...
je comprends pas pourquoi
subitement,
on me balance à la figure
toutes ces critiques sur mon père.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
En particulier de la part des gens
censés être ses amis.
- Pas si proches que ça.
- Les Carmichael étaient invités...
tous les 15 jours pour dîner.
On partait en vacances ensemble.
Comment pouvaient-ils,
s'ils le détestait ?
Ils ne le détestent pas.
Ils sont peut-être juste effrayés.
Mon père était un homme bon.
Il leur a donné de l'argent pour
l'horloge de la rue principale.
Il a fait plein de bonnes actions.
Peut-être,
mais ce n'était pas pour ça
qu'ils étaient gentils avec lui.
Ils étaient gentils avec lui
parce qu'il avait du pouvoir.
Ça marche comme ça.
On est arrivés à l'usine.
Vous êtes prêts ?
Il va falloir surveiller
les gardes, là-bas.
Ted, prépare-toi à
les éliminer.
Je devais pas juste conduire ?
Il faut surveiller les gardes pendant
que je fais sortir Jake et Eric.
Surveille-les jusqu'à mon retour.
Et si besoin est...
tire sur le sniper en premier.
Vous savez ce que je
faisais il y a 5 mois ?
Du tuning sur mon camion !
Je me préparais à
présenter mon mémoire.
Littérature russe.
Et vous ? Qu'est-ce que vous faisiez
quand tout était encore normal ?
Je ne me rappelle même plus.
Tout le monde est prêt ?
Comment saura-t-on que
vous avez fini là-bas ?
Vous saurez.
J'attendrai ici.
Russell, ce ne sont pas tes fils.
Tu peux rentrer chez toi.
On peut tout arranger.
Ça ne peut pas finir comme ça.
J'ai le sentiment que
ça ne fait que commencer.
Tu sais que tu peux venir
à Jericho si tu veux.
Ma famille est ici...
une petite fille.
C'est chez nous.
Et je suis sûr qu'en restant ici,
on pourra tout arranger.
Si ça tourne mal, suivez la voie
de chemin de fer vers l'est.
Je vous emmènerai vers la route 70,
vous pourrez éviter le contrôle.
Merci, Russell.
Bonne chance.
- Nous allons devoir remettre ça.
- Quoi ?
Mon adjoint pense que ce n'est pas
vraiment le moment. Reviens demain.
Je ne partirai pas sans
avoir vu mes fils, Phil !
Écoute-moi bien...
tu laisses revenir tous ceux qui ont
été blessés à Jéricho cette nuit,
et je t'accorderai 15 minutes
avec tes fils.
Ne compte pas là-dessus.
Allons-y, M. Green.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Nous allons vous escorter
jusqu'au poste de contrôle.
Montez dans la voiture,
s'il vous plait... M. Green.
<i>Il n'en reste plus que deux.
<i>Doucement...
Les mortiers sont prêts.
Tu peux y aller.
Debout !
Ne tirez pas !
Je suis envoyée pour ramener
le gars de Jericho !
Il a essayé de me tuer.
Je dois immédiatement parler
à Constantino, s'il vous plaît.
<i>Constantino, je te répète juste
ce qu'il m'a dit...
<i>Il doit se diriger vers l'usine
pour la faire sauter, et...
<i>ensuite il va...
faire sauter la Mairie.
<i>pour libérer Jake et Eric.
- Tu veux me faire croire
qu'il a piégé un bâtiment surveillé
24/24 par des hommes armés ?
Je te répète juste ce qu'il m'a dit.
J'essaye de t'aider,
laisse-moi rester en ville.
- Ne me garde pas ici !
- Crois-tu que j'ai oublié
la façon dont tu as trahi tes amis
quand nous t'avons amené ici ?
Je ne crois pas un mot
venant de toi.
Faites-le sortir d'ici.
Vous voulez quoi ?
Allez, on vous a
déjà tout dit.
Qu'attendez-vous de nous ?
- Je vous ai déjà tout dit.
- Peut-être bien,
mais peut-être que ton
frère sera un peu plus...
plus compréhensif...
si il pense que ça
sauvera ta vie.
Laissez-le !
Laissez-le !
<i>Ouvrez le barrage
et laissez-le passer.
- Laissez-le.
- Parle-moi !
Laissez-le !
Combien de routes sont
minées autour de Jericho ?
- Je ne sais pas !
- Tu sais quoi ?
Comment avez-vous vaincu
Ravenwood ? Dis-moi !
- Dis-le-moi !
- Eric, regarde-moi !
- Ne lui dis rien !
- Combien d'espions avez-vous ici ?
Dis-nous ce que tu sais
ou on lui tranche la gorge.
Laisse-le partir, Perkins !
C'était quoi ça ?
Venez !
Il y a eu une explosion à l'usine.
- Emmenez-les à l'entrepôt.
- Et les autres ?
Seulement eux, maintenant !
Détachez-les.
Allez, détachez-les !
Allez !
Plus vite !
Et merde !
Où tu allais ?
Dans le...
dans le camion.
Tu devais attendre ici
jusqu'à mon retour.
Je sais.
Respire.
Détends-toi.
Tout ira bien.
Je peux pas faire ça.
Je suis désolé, non...
je peux pas.
Je suis désolé.
Lève-toi !
- Ça va ?
- Je vais bien.
Jake, attention !
Par ici !
On y va !
Allez ! Debout !
Viens !
<i>Arrivage: patates, viande.
Troc à l'intérieur.
Merci, Wayne.
Avec le reste dans l'allée 4.
Je peux vous aider,
Mme Carmichael ?
On m'a dit que vous
aviez de la viande.
Une jument de M. Henderson
s'est cassée la jambe,
mais elle s'en est remise.
J'en prendrai 125 grammes.
Voilà 500 grammes de grain.
Ça ne sera pas suffisant.
Mais c'est ce qui est écrit :
2 Kg de grain...
pour 1 Kg de viande.
Le prix a augmenté.
Désolé.
Je vous en prie.
C'est pour Harry. Le docteur
dit qu'il a besoin de protéines.
C'est toi qui vois.
Mon père était un homme bon,
Mme Carmichael.
Oui, il l'était.
Il y a 125 grammes.
Merci.
C'est fermé !
Je voulais juste
vous rendre ceci.
- L'antiseptique nous a bien aidés.
- Merci.
J'ai pu en refaire.
On va le prendre.
Alors, personne dans cette ville
ne veut boire un coup ce soir ?
On pourrait penser que les gens viennent
ici pour l'ambiance ou l'hospitalité...
mais c'est l'alcool...
Ils reviendront quand
j'aurai fait de la vodka.
Merci.
Comment ça se passe en ville ?
Eh bien...
ça s'est calmé.
On a dû mettre fin à
pas mal de grabuge.
Tout ce cirque avec New Bern
a rendu les gens nerveux.
J'ai parlé à Gray.
Il dit que s'ils ne sont pas revenus
à l'aube, alors il ira lui-même.
Alors, ça sera une longue nuit.
Si vous voulez... rester,
écouter la musique ou...
Je pense que je vais rentrer
chez moi et les attendre.
Si j'entends quoi que ce soit...
je vous le ferai savoir.
Moi aussi.
Bonne nuit, Mary.
Je ne pensais pas aller si loin
avec l'essence qu'on avait.
On... a 12 Km à faire, et...
je ne pense pas
qu'elle pourra tenir.
On va essayer.
Elle nous a pas abandonnés.
On ne l'abandonne pas.
Ton couteau.
- Comment va ton épaule ?
- Ça me...
fait mal à hurler.
C'est bon.
Comment tu t'en sors ?
Je marche toujours.
Ouais.
C'est du vrai whiskey.
Ouais, c'en est vraiment.
- J'en planque juste pour les urgences.
- Ça m'étonne pas.
À quoi tu penses ?
C'est pas une pluie
de météorites, mais...
Merci d'être venu me chercher.
Tu sens ça ?
Les premiers blés
commencent à pousser.
Ça a toujours été ma période
préférée de l'année.
Écoutez ce vent.
Il souffle toujours, même
après ce que nous avons fait.
Et tout ce qui va arriver...
Il faut continuer.

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
We're the United States Marines
and we're here to help.
- Lance Corporal Mullen.
- Jake.
- Maggie.
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.
- Is any of this real?
- The gun's real.
Hands up!
Get 'em up!
You're a smart girl.
You need to get out before
these guys get you killed.
And go where?
Justin, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
The question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?
They get tired of you being sheriff?
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
This thing work?
We get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
Let's get it up as fast as we can.
Can we buy some more
of these things?
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.
We're gonna need food.
Ten wind turbines
for let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, we'll give you the food.
We're gonna need ten Jericho men
to help us build it.
What you are about to do
means this town's survival.
All right, let's move out.
Anything happens to any of them...
you're the first one I come for.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliceit up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
Come on.
This doesn't look good.
It could turn into a
full-blown riot.
As our guys show up,
you keep them back out of sight.
I don't want those New Bern
guys getting trigger-happy.
This salt mine is
private property!
You have 30 seconds to
get the hell out of here!
What did I tell you, Ted?
Sorry.
I knew it was you.
Yeah, but if it wasn't me...
you just gave up my name.
I want you to tell me
who your friend is
and where I can find him.
Things are gonna get
very bad for you
and your brother,
vxyou don't help us, Jake.
Why would I want to help you?
This is what I know...
is that you, your friend
and your brother
were caught attempting to sabotage
this town's sole means of manufacture.
Manufacturing weapons. You were man...
So I'm gonna
repeat the question:
Where is your friend?
Why don't you tell me what
vvhappened to Heather Lisinski?
Take him back.
Let's go, boy.
Word's gonna get back.
It's gonna get back to Jericho
about what you're doing,
and there's nothing you
can do to stop it!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Looks like they went easy on you.
- Yeah, for now.
They haven't found Hawkins yet.
We're gonna get out of here.
How many people have to die
before you don't care anymore?
April's death was not your fault.
I can't even be sure Heather's dead
with the lies they're spreading.
I've seen, Jake.
I don't think I can go back.
Staying here and getting
yourself killed
isn't going to make you
feel any better, trust me.
Remember the time
I was supposed to...
wake you up for that meteor shower?
Yeah, it was supposed
to be this...
once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Anyway...
you were so pissed at me,
so I finally gave up
and let you sleep.
I'm not giving up this time.
I should arrest you right here!
It's not his fault. We had to deal
with him in New Bern.
Gray, what the hell is this?
There's no deal!
I'm not giving away anything!
Listen, we'll think of something.
Right now we need to stand down.
No, we're not leaving
without our salt.
- It's not worth people getting hurt.
- She's right.
- All right, everybody...
- What are you doing?
Dale, I'm not going to
let people get killed.
- This was your idea.
- This is over!
Get your guys out of here!
Hey! Gray, come on!

How many more are there?
I'm not sure.
Six, maybe seven.
We need gurneys.
What happened?
Some guys from New Bern showed up
trying to steal our salt.
There was a shootout.
Oh, my God!
Okay, Harry...
Harry, we're gonna get you
cleaned up, buddy, okay?
All right, you need me
to look at your arm?
No, it's okay. I can wait.
We shouldn't be patching
those guys up.
We should be arresting them.
They opened fire on us!
We don't know who shot first, all right?
I'll get to an investigation.
Right now we need to make
sure people don't die.
Oh, my God.
Get him to Kenchy... now.
Could we get some ice, please?
She twisted her ankle.
I'm fine.
Hang on.
Hold on, Harry.
Hey, Mrs. Carmichael.
Is he gonna be all right?
No, he's not gonna be all right!
I didn't want this to happen.
Why should we expect
anything different?
As long as you and your boyfriend are
all set, the rest of us can go to hell!
Wouldn't your father be proud?
What is that supposed to mean?
Okay, come on.
She's just nervous.
Caroline, take a look at
her ankle, will ya?
Don't worry about it.
Gail, we heard about the shooting.
I brought the antiseptic
I've been working on.
What can we do to help?
Look, I need charts on
everybody who's checked in.
Annie, show her how to
fill one out, will ya?
- What's all this gonna mean for Eric?
- I don't know.
But haven't we heard anything?
I told you I don't know.
Johnston's working on it.
Now what I could use is a roll
of gauze and some bandages.
They're on the cart
next to the ultrasound.
I just don't know
what that looks like.
Never mind. I'll do it myself.
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?!
You didn't have to bring
rangers in there.
I was protec...
What?!
I'm afraid we've had
our first fatality.
One of your guys
from New Bern...
Dawson.
I didn't get the first name.
Jim Dawson.
You have got to let me
go back to New Bern
and tell them that you support
this salt mine deal.
No, that's not happening.
If they so much as think that
you fired the first shot...
- The who fi... What?
- Come on, Gray.
We need to work together
while we still can.
Things are bad in New Bern.
And when they find out
that six of us came here
and only five are coming back...
What are you saying, Russell?
You got people there.
You should bring 'em home.
Eric's still there.
Johnston, you need
to know something.
vEric hasn't been seen
for a few days.
And yesterday, Jake went
back there to try and find him.
You're telling me this now?
All right, come on. We leave now,
we can get there before dawn.
- No, no, no. I'm not authori...
- Did you hear him?
Constantino wants a bigger fight.
He's not gonna have
my sons as human shields.
Let's go!
Maggie?
Of all the jail cells, right?
Hardly recognize you
without your wardrobe.
What happened?
You guys get caught?
Kind of hard to pull that
voff without the tank.
We...
pretty much split up after Jericho.
I came to New Bern with
a couple of the guys,
but we got turned away at the border
a few weeks ago.
I was dumb enough to try
and sneak back in.
Why? This place is hell.
- It's worse out there.
- Really? That's hard to imagine.
I heard you two got dragged
in front of the Town Hall.
I don't want to scare you, Jake,
but you gotta get out of here.
It isn't exactly easy.
You could do it if you
got someone outside.
Why?
Do you?
Know someone outside?
No.
I'm just trying to help.
Last time you tried to help,
you nearly wiped out
my town's supplies.
- I was trying to survive.
- Yeah, so were we.
Look, I'm not saying it was right.
We had something people
wanted and we used it.
That's how it works.
You think you're helpless in here?
You're not.
Not if you have something they want.
What makes you think
I have something they want?
I don't think they're beating
the two of you up for fun.
Even if I did have something,
I wouldn't give it to them.
You're right. You shouldn't.
But I could.
Yeah, right.
No, thanks.
Listen, if you talk... they're going
to throw you back in your cell.
There's no way they're letting
either of you out of here.
But if I had the information,
I could trade it for my freedom.
And I can go get help.
What... give myself up
to get you out?
So I can get all three of us out.
And you can take me
back to Jericho.
I can't go anywhere without you.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Get up!
Hey, where are you taking him?
He's already told you
everything he knows!
How are things here?
Harry's going to be okay, but...
I'm worried about the staff.
Everybody's exhausted.
You sure you're okay to drive?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Better hit the road.
Be careful.
If I lose all three of you...
I swear to God...
I'm going to bring them home.
You get some sleep.
Got to go.
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?
Jake, just give me a chance, please.
We can end this.
His name is Robert Hawkins.
He said he's probably in a hunting cabin
owned by a guy named Ted Lewis.
He works at the factory.
Find out where it is.
Get over there.
You're supposed to
take me with you.
What?
That's... the deal I made
with Constantino.
I go with you, and as soon as
you see the guy's there,
you drop me off at the checkpoint.
Just talk to Constantino.
This is... he was supposed
to be here!
Take her with you.
If he's not there, kill her.
This is Johnston Green
from Jericho.
- We need talk to the sheriff.
- He's up at the cabin.
We have orders
he's not to be interrupted.
He'll want to be
interrupted for this.
It's not exactly Mayberry, is it?
Not since Ravenwood.
How are you with a rifle?
I hunted jackrabbits before.
Well, I've never shot a person,
if that's what you're asking.
We need to go back to the factory.
We need mortars.
Well, for what?
We can't launch them
over that fence.
We're not going
to launch them from here.
Phil.
Nice spread you got here.
I always wanted you
to see this place.
Well, I just...
wish it were under
better circumstances.
I just found out Eric's been
missing a couple of days.
I'd like a little update on that.
And there was an incident
at the salt mine.
Some of our people got hurt.
Let's take a walk.
<i>I'll go around back.</i>
<i>I got the front.
You watch her.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
You better hope he's home.
This mine deal,
this is your idea?
I thought it could help the town,
create a partnership.
- That didn't quite work out, did it?
- It was...
mishandled all the way around.
We were hoping we could
reach some agreement.
It's a little late for that.
You opened fire on our citizens.
- We don't know who shot first.
- Come on, Phil.
A bunch of guys shows up with guns
in the middle of the night
trying to take our salt.
What would you have done?
Jericho's continuous acts of
aggression against this town
are unjustifiable.
- What "continuous acts"?
We're neighbors, for God's sake.
I didn't hear much talk of neighbors
when you sent Ravenwood
straight to our door.
We almost blew everything
to hell and gone
trying to defend ourselves
against those mercenaries.
We had no idea where
they were headed next.
You couldn't try and warn us?
You couldn't help us when they were
raiding what little we had left,
shooting whoever got in their way?
My deputies, my friends?
Then I find both of your sons.
Both of them in my factory
trying to destroy the last form
of capital this town's got.
Slow down.
Jake was apprehended yesterday,
attempting to sabotage my factory.
That makes no sense.
The factory's producing wind turbines.
Your sons are pretty
bent on the idea.
I caught Eric the day before
trying to do the same thing.
We're holding both of them.
Now, you listen to me.
I don't care what you think
we've done to you,
but if any harm comes
to either of those boys,
this is not going to end well.
There's been little chance
of this ending well for some time.
I want to see my boys. Now.
What the hell's
taking them so long?
Who are you?
- Don't shoot!
- Who are you?
I'm with Jake.
I'm with Jake.
- Columbus! Columbus!
- What you say?
Jake said if I said Columbus
you'd know he sent me. I was...
I was with him in prison.
He sent me to help you.
He sent me to help you!
Columbus, Columbus.
I got it.
How is Jake doing?
He's okay.
Yeah?
That's Ted.
He's with me.
I'm Maggie.
Jake sent me.
Where are the cops?
They've been dealt with.
You don't want to go in there.
Here, this is everything.
So, what's the plan?
Plan?
There's going to be
an explosion in town.
Hopefully, it'll cause enough chaos
that we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.
I think I can help you do that.
I have an in with Constantino.
Come on. Get up.
What the hell happened?
I didn't tell them anything.
But I already gave them Hawkins.
It's not about Hawkins.
They want to know about Jericho.
What our defenses are like.
Do we have any troops?
Where are they posted?
Do we have a stockpile of weapons?
We have to get back.
We have to warn them.
We will.
We're not going to die in here.
Hey. I'm taking off.
Thanks for all your help.
Yeah. No problem.
You need to get some rest.
I will.
Listen.
I am sorry if I was abrupt earlier.
We're all under a lot of pressure.
Mary's really trying.
Maybe... maybe
you could give her a chance.
Yeah, I know.
It's... it's just being here.
This was April's whole world.
I miss her so much.
I know. It's not fair.
For what it's worth,
you and Mary have a lot in common.
What? We both love Eric?
No. I was actually going to say
you're both pretty tough broads.
You're both... a little hardheaded.
In a bar fight...
even money.
- Everything okay back here?
- Fine.
Thought you were supposed
to stay off your ankle.
Whatever. It's not like I got shot.
I told you, Skylar. It wasn't our fault.
I know. I just
don't understand why now it's okay
for all this random criticism about
my dad to come flying out at me.
What is that?
Especially coming from people
who were supposedly his friends.
I guess they're not his friends.
The Carmichaels used
to come over, like,
every other week for dinner.
We used to go on vacations together.
Why would they do
that if they hated him?
They don't hate him.
They're just scared of him.
My dad was a good person.
He gave them the money
for the clock on Main Street.
He... he did lots of good things.
Maybe he did,
but that's not why
they were nice to him.
They were nice to him because
he had a lot of power.
That's how it works.
We made it to the factory.
You both ready?
We're going to need someone to cover
those guards over there.
Ted, be ready to take them out.
I thought I was driving.
Someone's got to be on those guards
while I get Jake and Eric out.
Cover them until I get back,
and if need be,
take out the sniper first.
5 months ago,
you know what I was doing?
Customizing my truck.
I was getting ready to defend
my dissertation.
Russian lit.
How about you? What were you doing
last time things were normal?
I can't remember back that far.
Is everybody ready?
How will we know when
you're finished over there?
You'll know.
I'll wait here.
Russell, these are not your sons.
You can go on home.
We can fix this.
It doesn't have to end this way.
I get the feeling
it's just getting started.
You can come to Jericho if
you want to. You know that.
I've got family here,
a little girl.
This is our home.
And I keep thinking if I stay here,
maybe we can stop this.
You get in a bad situation, go to
the railroad tracks and go east.
It'll take you to Route 70 and
you can skip the checkpoint.
Thank you, Russell.
Good luck.
We're going to have
to do this another time.
- What?
- My deputy says it isn't a good day.
You can come back tomorrow.
I'm not leaving until
I see my sons, Phil.
I'll tell you what.
You bring back all of my citizens
who were shot in Jericho last night
and I'll give you 15 minutes
with your sons.
You don't want to do this.
Let's go, Mr. Green.
What's this?
We're going to escort you
back to the checkpoint.
Get in the car, please, Mr. Green.
Mortars are good to go.
Get up.
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot!
I'm the one they sent to get
the guy from Jericho!
He tried to kill me.
Please, I need to talk to Constantino
right away, please.
<i>Constantino, I'm just telling you
what he told me.
<i>He's going right now to the factory
to blow it up, and
<i>then he's gonna... he's gonna
blow up the town hall
<i>so that he can get Jake and Eric out.
- You expect me to believe
he wired a government building
under 24-hour armed surveillance?
I'm just telling you what he told me.
I'm trying to help you,
so you'll let me stay as a citizen.
- Please don't lock me in here!
- Do you think I've forgotten
how quickly you turned
on your own friends
when we first brought you in here?
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.
Get him out of here.
What is this?
Come on.
You already know everything.
What do you want from us?
- I already told you everything I know.
- Maybe so,
but maybe your brother'll
be a little more...
more forthcoming
if he thinks it'll save your life.
Let him go!
Let him go!
Move that barricade
and let him through.
- Let him go.
- Tell me.
Let him go!
How many of the roads
out of Jericho are wired?!
- I don't know!
- What you know!
How do you defeat Ravenwood?!
Tell me!
- Tell me right now!
- Eric, look at me!
- Don't tell him anything!
- How many spies have you sent here?!
Tell us what you know
or we slice his throat.
Leave him alone, Perkins!
What was that?
Come on!
There was an explosion at the factory.
- Move them to the warehouse.
- What about the other prisoners?
Just them, now!
Uncuff them.
Come on. Let's go.
Un-handcuff them!
Let's go!
Come on. Move!
Jeez.
Where you going?
To get the... to get the truck.
You were told to wait here
till I got back.
I know.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Everything's going fine.
I can't do this.
I'm sorry, no.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Get up!
- You okay?
- I'm good.
Jake, look out!
Over here!
Everybody go!
Go! Get up!
Come on!
<i>New Arrivals. Potatoes meat
inquire inside for trade.
Thanks, Wayne.
Uh, with the rest in aisle 4.
Can I help you, Mrs. Carmichael?
I heard you've got some meat.
One of Mr. Henderson's
mares broke her leg,
but she was healthy.
I'll take a quarter pound.
This is a pound of grain.
That's not gonna be enough.
But that's what it says.
It says 4 pounds of grain
for a pound of meat.
The price went up.
Sorry.
Please.
It's for Harry.
The doctor said he needs protein.
It's up to you.
My father was a good man,
Mrs. Carmichael.
Yes, he was.
There's a quarter pound.
Thank you.
We're closed!
I just wanted to return this.
- The antiseptic really helped.
- Thank you.
I have a fresh batch.
We'll take it.
So there's no one in town who
wants to have a drink tonight?
You'd think the big draw
would be the atmosphere
and the gracious hospitality,
but turns out,
it's the booze.
They'll be back when
I make more vodka.
Thank you.
How's everything going
down at the center?
Well...
it's calmed down.
We had to break up a lot of fights.
This whole New Bern thing
is making everybody really jumpy.
Talked to Gray.
Said if they're not back by dawn,
then he'd go up there himself.
Then it's gonna be a long night.
You're welcome to stay,
listen to music or...
I think I'll go home and wait there.
If I hear anything...
I'll let you know.
Same here.
Night, Mary.
I didn't think we'd make it this far
with the gas in that tank.
We, uh, we got about 12 miles
to cover, and,
I don't think she's gonna make it.
We have to try.
She didn't leave us.
We're not leaving her.
Here's your knife.
- How's your shoulder?
- Yeah.
Hurts like hell.
It's good.
How you holding up?
I'm still walking.
Yes, you are.
This is real whiskey.
This is actual whiskey.
- I kept a stash just for emergencies.
- I bet you did.
What do you think?
It's no meteor shower, but...
Thanks for coming to get me.
Smell that?
First wheat's going in.
Used to be my favorite time of year.
Listen to that wind.
Still moving, even
after everything we did.
With everything that's coming.
We should go.

Salut, Jonah.
Ce mec a fait 4 ans à <i>Lansing</i>
pour extorsion et braquage.
Pourquoi lui as-tu parlé ?
C'est bon, d'accord ?
Ça n'a rien à voir avec toi.
C'est mon père...
tout a un rapport avec moi.
Jonah a accepté de quitter
la ville et de ne pas revenir.
Exilé.
Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les élections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
Ils en avaient marre
que tu sois shérif ?
Je suis toujours shérif.
J'ai juste plus d'autorité.
Ce truc fonctionne ?
On peut avoir du courant ?
Probablement dès demain.
Montons-la aussi vite que possible.
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
Vous possédez les seules mines
de sel à 650 Km à la ronde.
On a besoin de nourriture.
10 éoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la récolte.
C'est bon, on vous donnera
la nourriture.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
Je savais pas que vous
reveniez aujourd'hui.
On n'était plus
en sécurité là-bas.
- Où est mon frère ?
- Pas vu depuis plusieurs jours.
<i>Tu ne peux pas aller à New Bern,
et faire ta petite guerre, Jake.</i></i>
Un inventaire complet des
ressources de Jericho.
Partagée, comme si
elle leur appartenait !
Ils fabriquent des obus
de mortiers.
Ils se préparent pour
une guerre !
Lâche ça !
Il va y avoir une
explosion en ville
pour qu'on puisse sortir
Jake et Eric de là.
On y va !
Restez sur vos gardes. Jake pense que
les gars de New Bern nous suivent.
Ils sont peut-être déjà là.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Que s'est-il passé ?
Nous avons un gros problème, Gray.
Où est Eric ?
Il va bien.
Il est à l'hôpital.
C'est à propos de la mine ?
C'est beaucoup plus grave.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Arrêtez-vous.
Vous m'entendez ?
Je vous parle.
N'avancez plus !
Qui es-tu ?
Je pense qu'on en a tué...
six à New Bern.
J'en ai compté huit.
Qui est-ce ?
Il dit qu'il est de New Bern,
et qu'il veut te parler.
A propos de quoi ?
<i>Je parle bien à Gray Anderson ?
<i>Ici Phil Constantino.
<i>Henry, tu peux rentrer
maintenant, fiston.
<i>Nous nettoyons encore le sang

On a des patrouilles
à tous les points de contrôle,
et tous les barrages,
mais impossible de couvrir le reste.
- Vous avez vu quelque chose ?
- Non, rien.
Que va-t-il réellement faire ?
Venir ici et commencer
à nous tirer dessus ?
Il y a 5 mois, on faisait des matchs
de football contre eux !
Ils ont torturé mon frère pour connaître
nos effectifs et notre armement.
Ils ont fabriqué
des centaines de mortiers.
Ils doivent pouvoir nous atteindre
dans un rayon de...
3 Km.
Les avoir est une chose...
mais les utiliser contre des innocents,
c'est différent !
C'est ce qu'on disait aussi
de la bombe atomique.
Il nous reste combien de temps ?
50 minutes.
<i>Aucune pulsation du bébé
depuis plus d'une heure.
<i>Respiration 16.
Pulsation 84.
<i>Le rythme cardiaque du foetus
inférieur à 5 bpm.
Maintenez la pression.
Appuyez là...
juste là.
Appuyez.
Plus fort.
Bon sang !
- Je n'entends plus rien.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- J'essaye de sauver April !
-<i> Le coeur du bébé s'est arrêté.
- Comment ça, arrêté ?
- Faites quelque chose.
Maman.
Mon Dieu !
Viens.
Viens.
On va s'occuper de toi, OK ?
Viens, mon coeur.
Nous n'allons rien donner
à ces gens.
Mme Herbert ?
Je cherche juste à offrir une chance
à notre ville.
Vous ne pouvez pas abandonner
votre ferme !
Gray dit qu'elle est trop éloignée
pour que les rangers nous aident.
Je ne vais pas les attendre là-bas
avec un fusil !
- Alors, je la défendrai.
- Bien sûr.
Allez-vous l'abandonner ?
La banque possède la moitié
de cette ferme de toute façon.
Fais ce que tu veux, Dale.
Attendez, soyons clairs.
Si je la défends,
alors elle sera à moi.
Si tu peux la défendre.
Dale, comment on va
protéger cette ferme ?
Ramenez tous les réfugiés
que vous pouvez.
D'accord.
Doucement.
J'ai eu si peur.
Quand tu n'es pas revenu,
j'ai pensé...
Je suis revenu.
Mon Dieu !
Je suis désolée.
Je n'ai pas voulu te blesser.
Je vais bien.
Écoutez tous !
Ils ont dit que vous aviez
de la nourriture ici.
Oui... j'ai de la nourriture.
Depuis ce matin, je possède
la 2ème plus grande ferme de Jericho.
Maintenant...
je vais avoir besoin
d'hommes pour la défendre.
- En échange de quoi ?
- Je vous promets trois repas par jour.
Tu veux qu'on risque nos vies
pour une promesse ?
Pas question.
Les gars, écoutez !
Depuis que vous êtes arrivé,
vous voulez un foyer, de la nourriture.
Vous étiez des réfugiés,
mais on vous traite toujours
comme des citoyens de second rang.
Vous ne pouvez pas
vous contenter de ça !
Si vous défendez cette ferme
avec succès,
alors tout le monde
obtiendra sa part.
Ce sera votre ferme.
Vous posséderez enfin quelque chose,
et personne ne pourra vous l'enlever.
Vous n'aurez plus jamais besoin
de demander l'aumône.
Alors...
Qui veut un avenir ?
Constantino a dit 4 heures.
Elles sont déjà passées.
Tu vas bien ?
Viens par ici.
On a des nouvelles des Rangers ?
Ceux qui sont rentrés n'ont rien vu.
Et si on appelait Contantino ?
Je n'ai rien à lui dire...
et je ne vais pas lui livrer la ville.
Il y a quelque chose
que je dois te dire.
C'est dingue. Tout le monde dit
que New Bern va nous attaquer.
On n'en sait rien.
Écoute...
Quelque chose est arrivé à Heather.
Elle a su que New Bern
fabriquait des armes,
et elle a essayé de les en empêcher.
Mais ils...
ils l'ont attrapée.
Personne ne l'a revue depuis.
- Qu'ont-ils fait d'elle ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Elle est morte ?
Jake, elle est morte ?
Écartez-vous des fenêtres !
T'es blessée ?
- Tu es blessée ?
- Non, je vais bien !
Attends ici.
Tu vas bien ?
À l'aide !
Maman !
Maman !
Protégez vos yeux !
Jake, ça va ?
Chérie ?
- Maman.
- Chérie, regarde-moi.
- Regarde-moi.
- Je n'entends rien.
Je sais, chérie.
Ça va s'arranger.
- On est là, Maman.
- Que s'est-il passé ?
<i>C'est bon chérie.
Tout va bien se passer.
<i>On va t'emmener à l'hôpital,
chérie.
<i>Viens.
Évacuez les rues !
Ce n'est peut-être pas fini.
On va rouvrir les abris, la mairie,
et l'hôpital...
Dépêchez !
Constantino.
Il est à la radio.
Constantino,
sale fils de pute,
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ?
<i>Je suis navré pour vos ennuis.
On a une douzaine de
blessés dans la rue.
<i>Je vous avais prévenu des conséquences
si vous ignoriez mes exigences.
Exigences ?
Je n'aurai de cesse dans ma vie
de vous faire condamner pour
ce que vous venez de faire.
<i>Je vous laisse encore 1 heure.
Ne vous avisez plus de lancer
un de ces trucs sur nous !
<i>Une heure, Gray.</i>
<i>Nous voulons sept fermes.</i>
<i>Il n'y avait que deux obus cette fois,
la prochaine, il y en aura trois.
<i>Si vous essayez de riposter,
ou si vous rejetez nos exigences,</i>
<i>on vous en envoie à nouveau.</i>
<i>Nous continuerons jour et nuit
aussi longtemps que nécessaire.</i>
La patrouille pense
qu'ils ont été tirés de l'ouest.
Trouve le plus de rangers que tu peux,
sors de la ville,
trouve ces mortiers.
Et on va les foutre en l'air !
Allez !
Aidez-le.
- Darcy, tu vas bien ?
- Oui, que s'est-il passé ?
C'est New Bern.
Ils nous bombardent.
- Est-ce que ça va ?
- Oui !
Écoute, il faut récupérer les enfants
et partir d'ici.
Pour aller où ?
Je connais une planque.
Si on peut arriver là-bas...
dans le Montana.
Aller dans le Montana sur ces routes ?
Quelles sont nos chances d'y arriver ?
Je ne sais pas.
- Des nouvelles de Constantino ?
- Non, mais je...
j'ai envoyé un groupe de rangers
pour détruire leurs mortiers.
J'aurai dû aller avec eux.
Tu n'étais pas là,
et ça ne pouvait pas attendre.
Que devons-nous faire ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il faut se réfugier sous terre,
tout de suite.
Écoutez-moi !
Il faut aller dans
les abris souterrains.
Toi, emmène tout le monde
dans des abris souterrains.
Rentrons.
Rentrons.
OK.
Je dois retourner en ville.
Sam, éloigne-toi.
Papa, il y a plus d'eau dans le garage.
Je vais en chercher ?
C'est la pièce la plus sûre.
Elle est complètement isolée,
et en béton renforcé.
Il faut rester ici, D.
Allez.
Entrez.
C'est cool !
Sam, Allison,
allez dans l'autre pièce.
- Pourquoi on ne...
- Sam, allons-y.
<i>Mais c'est nul ici !
Plus de secrets.
Ces mortiers ne venaient
pas de très loin.
- Combien de temps reste-t-il ?
- Quatre minutes.
<i>Ici Stanley Richmond.
Anderson, vous me recevez ?
- On te reçoit.
<i>- OK,
<i>on est à environ 100 mètres
des mortiers.
<i>Il y en a deux, posés à l'arrière
d'un camion plateau.
Où es-tu Stanley ?
<i>On est dans les bois,
vers le vieux pont de </i>Shaw Creek,
<i>3 Km à l'ouest de la ville.
<i>Il y a dix gars qui
gardent le camion.
<i>- Ils sont à découvert.</i>
- Vous pouvez les atteindre ?
<i>Oui, je pense.
Il y a un chemin jusqu'à la clairière.
Dis-lui d'envoyer des éclaireurs
de chaque côté.
Pas le temps !
Ils doivent savoir à quoi s'attendre.
Je ne permettrai pas
qu'ils nous bombardent à nouveau.
Ce ne sont pas des soldats...
Johnston, tu peux rester ou t'en aller,
mais les décisions sont de mon ressort.
- Stanley, sors de là. N'y va pas !
- Allez-y !
<i>Que fait-on ?
Débarrassez-vous-en.
<i>Reçu.
Pourquoi seulement maintenant ?
Tu vois, j'ai toujours pensé
que je pourrais vous protéger.
Mais maintenant, aujourd'hui...
je n'en suis plus aussi sûr.
On ne sera jamais en sécurité.
Plus maintenant.
Mais, tu sais...
au milieu de tout ça...
dans cette folie...
la seule chose qui a du sens à mes yeux,
je veux dire, vraiment, la...
seule chose...
c'est toi et les enfants.
Ça m'a pris du temps pour le
réaliser et j'en suis...
désolé.
Je suis...
vraiment désolé.
Tu m'as manqué.
Tu m'as manqué.
Comment saurons-nous
qu'ils ont réussi ?
Allez... Bordel !
Il s'est fait tiré dessus ?
Assieds-toi.
Emmenez-le à l'hôpital.
Il va bien ?
Tu es blessé ?
Où sont les autres ?
Stanley, que s'est-il passé là dehors ?
Je ne sais pas.
On s'est approchés du
camion du mortier.
Et ils attendaient,
ils nous ont encerclés.
Ils n'ont...
ils n'ont pas arrêté de tirer.
Stanley, où sont les autres ?
Où sont-ils, fiston ?
Ils...
ils sont tous morts.
Ils sont tous morts.
C'est insensé.
C'est insensé !
Fils de pute !
Recule !
Calme-toi !
Calme-toi.
Au Bailey's...
tout de suite.
Stanley a dit que les mortiers
étaient dans un camion ici,
juste là, à l'est du pont
de <i>Shaw Creek.
Ils vont tirer et se déplacer.
Vérifiez dans quelle direction
vont leurs traces.
Vous les pistez seulement.
On ne va pas encore faire
les choses à moitié.
D'abord, on les trouve, après on
décidera d'un plan d'attaque.
D'accord.
Les retrouver, pas plus.
Je viens avec vous.
Ce n'est pas une question.
Très bien.
D'après les traces,
je dirais que trois,
voire quatre camions
ont pris cette route.
Ils pourront toucher la ville facilement
dès qu'ils seront sur la Route 6.
Hawkins a vu un cinq tonnes venant
de New Bern sur cette route
six kilomètres plus bas.
Peut-être un camion de ravitaillement
qui se rend vers les mortiers.
On peut le rattraper.
D'accord.
On y va.
Arrêtez le camion maintenant !
Arrêtez-le !
Ils sont clean.
Laissez-les.
Vous faites dans l'attaque à main armée
maintenant, vous deux ?
On a besoin de tes gars, Dale.
Mes hommes ne se battent pas
pour Gray Anderson.
On te demande d'aider
à défendre la ville.
Si nous perdons,
tu n'auras plus rien.
Si on vous aide,
on garde la ferme de Mme Herbert.
Ainsi que la ferme abandonnée
des Surrey.
Tu as déjà la moitié
de la mine de sel,
et un pourcentage sur chaque ferme
du coin. Et tu en veux plus ?
- C'est ça le business.
- Je ne te parle pas de business.
Je te demande
de le faire pour moi.
Il faut que tu nous aides.
Préparez-vous à partir.
Ils vont rechercher ce camion.
La dernière fois,
ils ont failli me lyncher.
Ils peuvent aller en enfer.
Écoute-moi.
Non, toi tu m'écoutes.
J'ai vu New Bern déplacer son matériel
dans le coin ces trois derniers jours.
Ça va être un bain de sang.
Tu ferais mieux de venir avec moi.
Ma vie est à Jericho.
Et je suis ton père.
C'est la loi du plus rapide et
du plus fort là dehors.
Je serai plus en sécurité avec toi,
à voler des camions ?
Personne n'y est resté.
Et si New Bern ne prend pas Jericho,
quelqu'un d'autre le fera.
Viens avec moi.
Donne-nous les cartes,
aide-nous à détruire les mortiers,
aide-nous à nous battre.
Tu auras la moitié...
des armes, de la nourriture
et de l'essence que nous prendrons.
Et si l'armée de New Bern est
aussi grande que tu le dis,
tu y seras bien plus gagnant
qu'en attaquant un camion à la fois.
Tu tiens beaucoup plus de moi que
tu ne veux bien l'admettre.
Changement de plan !
Quand le gouvernement sera rétabli,
nous ferons valoir nos droits...
nous récupérerons nos fermes.
Et si le gouvernement
n'est pas rétabli ?
Et si rien ne change ?
Ils viennent dans l'intention
de nous tuer.
Gray dit qu'il ne manque que 3 fermes
pour conclure l'accord.
Et on n'est pas prêts à se battre.
Je vous préparerai.
Allez parler aux fermiers,
dites-leur de ne pas céder.
Qui allez-vous trouver pour
vous battre, Johnston ?
Les flics ?
Les rangers ?
Papa ?
Il y a 11 sites potentiels
pour leurs mortiers.
Lequel sera utilisé la prochaine fois ?
Le chauffeur parlait de... celui-ci.
Si on croit ce qu'il dit.
Comment sont gardés les camions ?
- Des hommes, dans les broussailles.
- Je ne suis pas sûr de te croire.
Ils ont presque 30 gars
qui gardent ce camion.
J'en ai vu neuf ici.
Gray a 7 fermiers de son côté.
Il va appeler New Bern,
et accepter le marché.
En faisant cela, New Bern
occupera les fermes dans 30 minutes.
On ne pourra plus
se débarrasser d'eux.
Qu'allons-nous faire ?
Je me vois dans l'obligation de
faire un pacte avec le diable.
Vous me flattez.
Retournez à la Mairie, faites
tout ce qu'il faut,
mais ne laissez pas Gray les appeler.
Que voulez-vous dire par
"tout ce qu'il faut" ?
Je pense qu'il est temps
de choisir son camp.
Pourquoi tu les as amenés ici ?
IIs veulent juste
vous parler un instant.
Ne fais pas ce marché
avec Constantino.
Il n'y a pas à discuter.
Si tu acceptes, ils ne se satisferont
pas de ces 7 fermes.
Les gens vont mourir de faim, Gray.
En admettant qu'ils ne nous tuent pas
quand la nourriture se fera rare.
Partez.
- Maintenant !
- Écoute, Gray.
Pourquoi leur cèdes-tu
aussi facilement ?
J'ai risqué ma vie pour
cette ville, Gray.
Tu vas m'écouter, d'accord ?
- Ils ne sont pas morts par ta faute...
- Virez-les de là !
Virez-les de là !
Tu vas écouter
ce que j'ai à te dire.
Ce n'était pas ta faute.
Calmez-vous !
Baissez vos flingues !
Baissez vos flingues !
On a des hommes là-bas, Gray.
- Quoi ?
- On a des hommes là-bas !
Baissez vos armes !
- Brooks, baisse ton arme !
- Toi aussi.
Qui est là-bas ?
Qui est là-bas,
et que font-ils ?
Jake, Hawkins, mon père.
Et ils vont tenter
de neutraliser les mortiers.
Tous les trois ?
Ils pensent faire quoi ?
Tu ne peux pas abandonner
ces fermes.
- Tu comprends ?
- On ne peut pas lutter !
On ne peut pas lutter !
Vous avez vu
ce qu'il s'est passé ce matin.
Nous ne sommes pas prêts pour ça.
J'ai parlé à Constantino,
et je lui ai promis
qu'on ne ripostera pas
s'il nous accorde du temps
pour trouver un accord.
On a des cartes avec leurs positions,
leurs voies de ravitaillement.
Où avez-vous eu ça ?
On a des camions, de l'essence
et des armes.
De quoi tu parles ?
Où avez-vous eu tout ça ?
On s'est allié avec Jonah Prowse.
Il a 30 hommes avec lui.
30 hommes !
Ils vont tous nous faire tuer !
<i>Ici New Bern.
A vous.
Ne t'approche pas
de cette radio, Gray.
<i>Maire Anderson,
vous êtes là ?
Johnston Green, exact ?
Il y a deux ans,
vous êtes venu à New Bern...
et vous avez fini 4ème
au concours de pêche du lac de <i>Big Hill.
J'ai fini second.
Allons-y.
<i>Maire Anderson,
le délai expire bientôt.
Elle a pourtant dit à Constantino,
que je n'ai envoyé personne là-bas.
Refuse cet accord.
Gagne du temps,
on pourra neutraliser ces mortiers.
Négocie avec Constantino.
Donc, on sort de ce camion,
et si ça tourne mal,
Jonah couvrira nos arrières, exact ?
Tu me rassures vraiment, Jake !
Emily est avec eux.
Il sera là.
<i>Maire Anderson,
vous êtes là ?
Oui, je suis là, Phil.
<i>Quelle est votre décision ?
Tu es doué pour négocier, Gray.
Tu sais comment gérer ça.
On ne veut pas se battre.
Alors...
que diriez-vous...
des fermes laitières
de <i>Levin</i> et <i>Hides</i>
en échange de celle de Richmond ?
<i>Ça fait moins de surface.
Oui, je sais, mais...
vous auriez une laiterie
et une ferme de soja,
mais aussi 20 hectares de maïs
chez <i>Hides.
et j'avoue que ce serait
plus facile à négocier ici.
Où t'étais passé ?
T'as 3 heures de retard.
Une embuscade près de <i>Calvert.
J'ai dû contourner...
revenir par <i>Van Ness.
J'ai un demi-chevreuil cuit
à l'arrière.
<i>J'ai un demi-chevreuil cuit
à l'arrière.
<i>Tu rigoles ?
On en a bien besoin !
On a de la bouffe !
On mangera par équipe.
Ne relevez pas tout le monde
en même temps.
Plus un geste.
Lâchez vos armes.
Dans le camion.
Allez !
<i>Mes hommes me disent que
tout le bétail de </i>Hides
<i>a été abattu pour la nourriture.
Vraiment ?
Je ne pense pas, mais...
je vais me renseigner.
Parlons de la mine de sel.
Vous détenez déjà 25% de la mine.
On peut pas en rester là ?
<i>Que cherchez-vous à faire, Gray ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
<i>La négociation est terminée.
Non, Phil, attendez.
<i>Vous avez 30 secondes, Gray,
et j'envoie d'autres obus.
On a presque un accord, Phil.
Allez !
Ils sont là !
Ils sont dans le camp !
Je boucle le camp.
Allez. Levez-vous !
Où est Jonah, bordel ?
Il veut éviter les tirs croisés.
Cessez le feu !
Cessez le feu !
Stop !
Celui-ci est à vous.
On se revoit au camp.
Attends.
De quoi tu parles ?
Le contrat a changé.
C'est quoi ce bordel !
Nouvel arrangement,
je prends les armes, la nourriture,
l'essence, les flingues, tout.
- C'était 50-50.
- Et qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
Vous, vous serez à l'abri
des bombes.
Écoute, Jonah...
Tout ne va pas s'arranger
comme ça.
On a besoin de ces armes !
Pourquoi tu fais ça ?
Tu me dois bien plus que ça.
Je suis un voleur, pas un soldat.
Tu as promis de nous aider.
Écoute, tu ne devrais pas
rester près de moi.
Tu es une institutrice, chérie.
Une institutrice.
Va-t-en.
On le laisse filer comme ça ?
On a besoin de ces armes.
Des armes...
c'est pas un problème.
Tu avais tout ça,
et tu n'as jamais rien dit ?
Je ne pensais pas qu'un jour
je serais chez moi dans cette ville.
Il n'y a plus qu'à les charger.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fout ?
Pourquoi il n'a pas tiré ces mortiers ?
On les a détruits ?
Il nous aurait contactés.
On a neutralisé les mortiers.
Putain, ouais.
<i>Vous êtes là ?
<i>Vous allez devoir assumer vos actes.
<i>Il n'est plus question de marché,
plus de pitié.
<i>Nous arrivons.
<i>C'est la guerre.
<i>Vous m'entendez, Gray ?
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Stanley, ramène tous ceux
que tu trouveras.
Je vais coordonner
toutes les patrouilles.
La plupart d'entre vous n'a aucune idée
de ce qu'ils doivent faire,
ou de ce qui va arriver.
Certains le savent.
Ce n'est pas un combat
pour nos terres
ou pour notre ville.
C'est une lutte pour notre survie.
Priez pour nous tous.
Et priez également pour
les hommes et femmes de New Bern.
Priez Dieu de nous pardonner.
Toutes les personnes aptes...
qui ont besoin d'une arme...
de 16 ans ou plus...
mettez-vous en ligne.

<i>Précédemment dans </i>Jericho
Salut, Jonah.
Ce mec a fait 4 ans à <i>Lansing</i>
pour extorsion et braquage.
Pourquoi lui as-tu parlé ?
C'est bon, d'accord ?
Ça n'a rien à voir avec toi.
C'est mon père...
tout a un rapport avec moi.
Jonah a accepté de quitter
la ville et de ne pas revenir.
Exilé.
Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les élections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
Ils en avaient marre
que tu sois shérif ?
Je suis toujours shérif.
J'ai juste plus d'autorité.
Ce truc fonctionne ?
On peut avoir du courant ?
Probablement dès demain.
Montons-la aussi vite que possible.
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
Vous possédez les seules mines
de sel à 650 Km à la ronde.
On a besoin de nourriture.
10 éoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la récolte.
C'est bon, on vous donnera
la nourriture.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
Je savais pas que vous
reveniez aujourd'hui.
On n'était plus
en sécurité là-bas.
- Où est mon frère ?
- Pas vu depuis plusieurs jours.
<i>Tu ne peux pas aller à New Bern,
et faire ta petite guerre, Jake.</i></i>
Un inventaire complet des
ressources de Jericho.
Partagée, comme si
elle leur appartenait !
Ils fabriquent des obus
de mortiers.
Ils se préparent pour
une guerre !
Lâche ça !
Il va y avoir une
explosion en ville
pour qu'on puisse sortir
Jake et Eric de là.
On y va !
Restez sur vos gardes. Jake pense que
les gars de New Bern nous suivent.
Ils sont peut-être déjà là.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Que s'est-il passé ?
Nous avons un gros problème, Gray.
Où est Eric ?
Il va bien.
Il est à l'hôpital.
C'est à propos de la mine ?
C'est beaucoup plus grave.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Arrêtez-vous.
Vous m'entendez ?
Je vous parle.
N'avancez plus !
Qui es-tu ?
Je pense qu'on en a tué...
six à New Bern.
J'en ai compté huit.
Qui est-ce ?
Il dit qu'il est de New Bern,
et qu'il veut te parler.
A propos de quoi ?
<i>Je parle bien à Gray Anderson ?
<i>Ici Phil Constantino.
<i>Henry, tu peux rentrer
maintenant, fiston.
<i>Nous nettoyons encore le sang
de mes adjoints
<i>dans les rues de New Bern,
<i>vous devez donc comprendre

<i>Nous demandons 7 fermes,

On a des patrouilles
à tous les points de contrôle,
et tous les barrages,
mais impossible de couvrir le reste.
- Vous avez vu quelque chose ?
- Non, rien.
Que va-t-il réellement faire ?
Venir ici et commencer
à nous tirer dessus ?
Il y a 5 mois, on faisait des matchs
de football contre eux !
Ils ont torturé mon frère pour connaître
nos effectifs et notre armement.
Ils ont fabriqué
des centaines de mortiers.
Ils doivent pouvoir nous atteindre
dans un rayon de...
3 Km.
Les avoir est une chose...
mais les utiliser contre des innocents,
c'est différent !
C'est ce qu'on disait aussi
de la bombe atomique.
Il nous reste combien de temps ?
50 minutes.
<i>Aucune pulsation du bébé
depuis plus d'une heure.
<i>Respiration 16.
Pulsation 84.
<i>Le rythme cardiaque du foetus
inférieur à 5 bpm.
Maintenez la pression.
Appuyez là...
juste là.
Appuyez.
Plus fort.
Bon sang !
- Je n'entends plus rien.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- J'essaye de sauver April !
-<i> Le coeur du bébé s'est arrêté.
- Comment ça, arrêté ?
- Faites quelque chose.
Maman.
Mon Dieu !
Viens.
Viens.
On va s'occuper de toi, OK ?
Viens, mon coeur.
Nous n'allons rien donner
à ces gens.
Mme Herbert ?
Je cherche juste à offrir une chance
à notre ville.
Vous ne pouvez pas abandonner
votre ferme !
Gray dit qu'elle est trop éloignée
pour que les rangers nous aident.
Je ne vais pas les attendre là-bas
avec un fusil !
- Alors, je la défendrai.
- Bien sûr.
Allez-vous l'abandonner ?
La banque possède la moitié
de cette ferme de toute façon.
Fais ce que tu veux, Dale.
Attendez, soyons clairs.
Si je la défends,
alors elle sera à moi.
Si tu peux la défendre.
Dale, comment on va
protéger cette ferme ?
Ramenez tous les réfugiés
que vous pouvez.
D'accord.
Doucement.
J'ai eu si peur.
Quand tu n'es pas revenu,
j'ai pensé...
Je suis revenu.
Mon Dieu !
Je suis désolée.
Je n'ai pas voulu te blesser.
Je vais bien.
Écoutez tous !
Ils ont dit que vous aviez
de la nourriture ici.
Oui... j'ai de la nourriture.
Depuis ce matin, je possède
la 2ème plus grande ferme de Jericho.
Maintenant...
je vais avoir besoin
d'hommes pour la défendre.
- En échange de quoi ?
- Je vous promets trois repas par jour.
Tu veux qu'on risque nos vies
pour une promesse ?
Pas question.
Les gars, écoutez !
Depuis que vous êtes arrivé,
vous voulez un foyer, de la nourriture.
Vous étiez des réfugiés,
mais on vous traite toujours
comme des citoyens de second rang.
Vous ne pouvez pas
vous contenter de ça !
Si vous défendez cette ferme
avec succès,
alors tout le monde
obtiendra sa part.
Ce sera votre ferme.
Vous posséderez enfin quelque chose,
et personne ne pourra vous l'enlever.
Vous n'aurez plus jamais besoin
de demander l'aumône.
Alors...
Qui veut un avenir ?
Constantino a dit 4 heures.
Elles sont déjà passées.
Tu vas bien ?
Viens par ici.
On a des nouvelles des Rangers ?
Ceux qui sont rentrés n'ont rien vu.
Et si on appelait Contantino ?
Je n'ai rien à lui dire...
et je ne vais pas lui livrer la ville.
Il y a quelque chose
que je dois te dire.
C'est dingue. Tout le monde dit
que New Bern va nous attaquer.
On n'en sait rien.
Écoute...
Quelque chose est arrivé à Heather.
Elle a su que New Bern
fabriquait des armes,
et elle a essayé de les en empêcher.
Mais ils...
ils l'ont attrapée.
Personne ne l'a revue depuis.
- Qu'ont-ils fait d'elle ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Elle est morte ?
Jake, elle est morte ?
Écartez-vous des fenêtres !
T'es blessée ?
- Tu es blessée ?
- Non, je vais bien !
Attends ici.
Tu vas bien ?
À l'aide !
Maman !
Maman !
Protégez vos yeux !
Jake, ça va ?
Chérie ?
- Maman.
- Chérie, regarde-moi.
- Regarde-moi.
- Je n'entends rien.
Je sais, chérie.
Ça va s'arranger.
- On est là, Maman.
- Que s'est-il passé ?
<i>C'est bon chérie.
Tout va bien se passer.
<i>On va t'emmener à l'hôpital,
chérie.
<i>Viens.
Évacuez les rues !
Ce n'est peut-être pas fini.
On va rouvrir les abris, la mairie,
et l'hôpital...
Dépêchez !
Constantino.
Il est à la radio.
Constantino,
sale fils de pute,
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ?
<i>Je suis navré pour vos ennuis.
On a une douzaine de
blessés dans la rue.
<i>Je vous avais prévenu des conséquences
si vous ignoriez mes exigences.
Exigences ?
Je n'aurai de cesse dans ma vie
de vous faire condamner pour
ce que vous venez de faire.
<i>Je vous laisse encore 1 heure.
Ne vous avisez plus de lancer
un de ces trucs sur nous !
<i>Une heure, Gray.</i>
<i>Nous voulons sept fermes.</i>
<i>Il n'y avait que deux obus cette fois,
la prochaine, il y en aura trois.
<i>Si vous essayez de riposter,
ou si vous rejetez nos exigences,</i>
<i>on vous en envoie à nouveau.</i>
<i>Nous continuerons jour et nuit
aussi longtemps que nécessaire.</i>
La patrouille pense
qu'ils ont été tirés de l'ouest.
Trouve le plus de rangers que tu peux,
sors de la ville,
trouve ces mortiers.
Et on va les foutre en l'air !
Allez !
Aidez-le.
- Darcy, tu vas bien ?
- Oui, que s'est-il passé ?
C'est New Bern.
Ils nous bombardent.
- Est-ce que ça va ?
- Oui !
Écoute, il faut récupérer les enfants
et partir d'ici.
Pour aller où ?
Je connais une planque.
Si on peut arriver là-bas...
dans le Montana.
Aller dans le Montana sur ces routes ?
Quelles sont nos chances d'y arriver ?
Je ne sais pas.
- Des nouvelles de Constantino ?
- Non, mais je...
j'ai envoyé un groupe de rangers
pour détruire leurs mortiers.
J'aurai dû aller avec eux.
Tu n'étais pas là,
et ça ne pouvait pas attendre.
Que devons-nous faire ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il faut se réfugier sous terre,
tout de suite.
Écoutez-moi !
Il faut aller dans
les abris souterrains.
Toi, emmène tout le monde
dans des abris souterrains.
Rentrons.
Rentrons.
OK.
Je dois retourner en ville.
Sam, éloigne-toi.
Papa, il y a plus d'eau dans le garage.
Je vais en chercher ?
C'est la pièce la plus sûre.
Elle est complètement isolée,
et en béton renforcé.
Il faut rester ici, D.
Allez.
Entrez.
C'est cool !
Sam, Allison,
allez dans l'autre pièce.
- Pourquoi on ne...
- Sam, allons-y.
<i>Mais c'est nul ici !
Plus de secrets.
Ces mortiers ne venaient
pas de très loin.
- Combien de temps reste-t-il ?
- Quatre minutes.
<i>Ici Stanley Richmond.
Anderson, vous me recevez ?
- On te reçoit.
<i>- OK,
<i>on est à environ 100 mètres
des mortiers.
<i>Il y en a deux, posés à l'arrière
d'un camion plateau.
Où es-tu Stanley ?
<i>On est dans les bois,
vers le vieux pont de </i>Shaw Creek,
<i>3 Km à l'ouest de la ville.
<i>Il y a dix gars qui
gardent le camion.
<i>- Ils sont à découvert.</i>
- Vous pouvez les atteindre ?
<i>Oui, je pense.
Il y a un chemin jusqu'à la clairière.
Dis-lui d'envoyer des éclaireurs
de chaque côté.
Pas le temps !
Ils doivent savoir à quoi s'attendre.
Je ne permettrai pas
qu'ils nous bombardent à nouveau.
Ce ne sont pas des soldats...
Johnston, tu peux rester ou t'en aller,
mais les décisions sont de mon ressort.
- Stanley, sors de là. N'y va pas !
- Allez-y !
<i>Que fait-on ?
Débarrassez-vous-en.
<i>Reçu.
Pourquoi seulement maintenant ?
Tu vois, j'ai toujours pensé
que je pourrais vous protéger.
Mais maintenant, aujourd'hui...
je n'en suis plus aussi sûr.
On ne sera jamais en sécurité.
Plus maintenant.
Mais, tu sais...
au milieu de tout ça...
dans cette folie...
la seule chose qui a du sens à mes yeux,
je veux dire, vraiment, la...
seule chose...
c'est toi et les enfants.
Ça m'a pris du temps pour le
réaliser et j'en suis...
désolé.
Je suis...
vraiment désolé.
Tu m'as manqué.
Tu m'as manqué.
Comment saurons-nous
qu'ils ont réussi ?
Allez... Bordel !
Il s'est fait tiré dessus ?
Assieds-toi.
Emmenez-le à l'hôpital.
Il va bien ?
Tu es blessé ?
Où sont les autres ?
Stanley, que s'est-il passé là dehors ?
Je ne sais pas.
On s'est approchés du
camion du mortier.
Et ils attendaient,
ils nous ont encerclés.
Ils n'ont...
ils n'ont pas arrêté de tirer.
Stanley, où sont les autres ?
Où sont-ils, fiston ?
Ils...
ils sont tous morts.
Ils sont tous morts.
C'est insensé.
C'est insensé !
Fils de pute !
Recule !
Calme-toi !
Calme-toi.
Au Bailey's...
tout de suite.
Stanley a dit que les mortiers
étaient dans un camion ici,
juste là, à l'est du pont
de <i>Shaw Creek.
Ils vont tirer et se déplacer.
Vérifiez dans quelle direction
vont leurs traces.
Vous les pistez seulement.
On ne va pas encore faire
les choses à moitié.
D'abord, on les trouve, après on
décidera d'un plan d'attaque.
D'accord.
Les retrouver, pas plus.
Je viens avec vous.
Ce n'est pas une question.
Très bien.
D'après les traces,
je dirais que trois,
voire quatre camions
ont pris cette route.
Ils pourront toucher la ville facilement
dès qu'ils seront sur la Route 6.
Hawkins a vu un cinq tonnes venant
de New Bern sur cette route
six kilomètres plus bas.
Peut-être un camion de ravitaillement
qui se rend vers les mortiers.
On peut le rattraper.
D'accord.
On y va.
Arrêtez le camion maintenant !
Arrêtez-le !
Ils sont clean.
Laissez-les.
Vous faites dans l'attaque à main armée
maintenant, vous deux ?
On a besoin de tes gars, Dale.
Mes hommes ne se battent pas
pour Gray Anderson.
On te demande d'aider
à défendre la ville.
Si nous perdons,
tu n'auras plus rien.
Si on vous aide,
on garde la ferme de Mme Herbert.
Ainsi que la ferme abandonnée
des Surrey.
Tu as déjà la moitié
de la mine de sel,
et un pourcentage sur chaque ferme
du coin. Et tu en veux plus ?
- C'est ça le business.
- Je ne te parle pas de business.
Je te demande
de le faire pour moi.
Il faut que tu nous aides.
Préparez-vous à partir.
Ils vont rechercher ce camion.
La dernière fois,
ils ont failli me lyncher.
Ils peuvent aller en enfer.
Écoute-moi.
Non, toi tu m'écoutes.
J'ai vu New Bern déplacer son matériel
dans le coin ces trois derniers jours.
Ça va être un bain de sang.
Tu ferais mieux de venir avec moi.
Ma vie est à Jericho.
Et je suis ton père.
C'est la loi du plus rapide et
du plus fort là dehors.
Je serai plus en sécurité avec toi,
à voler des camions ?
Personne n'y est resté.
Et si New Bern ne prend pas Jericho,
quelqu'un d'autre le fera.
Viens avec moi.
Donne-nous les cartes,
aide-nous à détruire les mortiers,
aide-nous à nous battre.
Tu auras la moitié...
des armes, de la nourriture
et de l'essence que nous prendrons.
Et si l'armée de New Bern est
aussi grande que tu le dis,
tu y seras bien plus gagnant
qu'en attaquant un camion à la fois.
Tu tiens beaucoup plus de moi que
tu ne veux bien l'admettre.
Changement de plan !
Quand le gouvernement sera rétabli,
nous ferons valoir nos droits...
nous récupérerons nos fermes.
Et si le gouvernement
n'est pas rétabli ?
Et si rien ne change ?
Ils viennent dans l'intention
de nous tuer.
Gray dit qu'il ne manque que 3 fermes
pour conclure l'accord.
Et on n'est pas prêts à se battre.
Je vous préparerai.
Allez parler aux fermiers,
dites-leur de ne pas céder.
Qui allez-vous trouver pour
vous battre, Johnston ?
Les flics ?
Les rangers ?
Papa ?
Il y a 11 sites potentiels
pour leurs mortiers.
Lequel sera utilisé la prochaine fois ?
Le chauffeur parlait de... celui-ci.
Si on croit ce qu'il dit.
Comment sont gardés les camions ?
- Des hommes, dans les broussailles.
- Je ne suis pas sûr de te croire.
Ils ont presque 30 gars
qui gardent ce camion.
J'en ai vu neuf ici.
Gray a 7 fermiers de son côté.
Il va appeler New Bern,
et accepter le marché.
En faisant cela, New Bern
occupera les fermes dans 30 minutes.
On ne pourra plus
se débarrasser d'eux.
Qu'allons-nous faire ?
Je me vois dans l'obligation de
faire un pacte avec le diable.
Vous me flattez.
Retournez à la Mairie, faites
tout ce qu'il faut,
mais ne laissez pas Gray les appeler.
Que voulez-vous dire par
"tout ce qu'il faut" ?
Je pense qu'il est temps
de choisir son camp.
Pourquoi tu les as amenés ici ?
IIs veulent juste
vous parler un instant.
Ne fais pas ce marché
avec Constantino.
Il n'y a pas à discuter.
Si tu acceptes, ils ne se satisferont
pas de ces 7 fermes.
Les gens vont mourir de faim, Gray.
En admettant qu'ils ne nous tuent pas
quand la nourriture se fera rare.
Partez.
- Maintenant !
- Écoute, Gray.
Pourquoi leur cèdes-tu
aussi facilement ?
J'ai risqué ma vie pour
cette ville, Gray.
Tu vas m'écouter, d'accord ?
- Ils ne sont pas morts par ta faute...
- Virez-les de là !
Virez-les de là !
Tu vas écouter
ce que j'ai à te dire.
Ce n'était pas ta faute.
Calmez-vous !
Baissez vos flingues !
Baissez vos flingues !
On a des hommes là-bas, Gray.
- Quoi ?
- On a des hommes là-bas !
Baissez vos armes !
- Brooks, baisse ton arme !
- Toi aussi.
Qui est là-bas ?
Qui est là-bas,
et que font-ils ?
Jake, Hawkins, mon père.
Et ils vont tenter
de neutraliser les mortiers.
Tous les trois ?
Ils pensent faire quoi ?
Tu ne peux pas abandonner
ces fermes.
- Tu comprends ?
- On ne peut pas lutter !
On ne peut pas lutter !
Vous avez vu
ce qu'il s'est passé ce matin.
Nous ne sommes pas prêts pour ça.
J'ai parlé à Constantino,
et je lui ai promis
qu'on ne ripostera pas
s'il nous accorde du temps
pour trouver un accord.
On a des cartes avec leurs positions,
leurs voies de ravitaillement.
Où avez-vous eu ça ?
On a des camions, de l'essence
et des armes.
De quoi tu parles ?
Où avez-vous eu tout ça ?
On s'est allié avec Jonah Prowse.
Il a 30 hommes avec lui.
30 hommes !
Ils vont tous nous faire tuer !
<i>Ici New Bern.
A vous.
Ne t'approche pas
de cette radio, Gray.
<i>Maire Anderson,
vous êtes là ?
Johnston Green, exact ?
Il y a deux ans,
vous êtes venu à New Bern...
et vous avez fini 4ème
au concours de pêche du lac de <i>Big Hill.
J'ai fini second.
Allons-y.
<i>Maire Anderson,
le délai expire bientôt.
Elle a pourtant dit à Constantino,
que je n'ai envoyé personne là-bas.
Refuse cet accord.
Gagne du temps,
on pourra neutraliser ces mortiers.
Négocie avec Constantino.
Donc, on sort de ce camion,
et si ça tourne mal,
Jonah couvrira nos arrières, exact ?
Tu me rassures vraiment, Jake !
Emily est avec eux.
Il sera là.
<i>Maire Anderson,
vous êtes là ?
Oui, je suis là, Phil.
<i>Quelle est votre décision ?
Tu es doué pour négocier, Gray.
Tu sais comment gérer ça.
On ne veut pas se battre.
Alors...
que diriez-vous...
des fermes laitières
de <i>Levin</i> et <i>Hides</i>
en échange de celle de Richmond ?
<i>Ça fait moins de surface.
Oui, je sais, mais...
vous auriez une laiterie
et une ferme de soja,
mais aussi 20 hectares de maïs
chez <i>Hides.
et j'avoue que ce serait
plus facile à négocier ici.
Où t'étais passé ?
T'as 3 heures de retard.
Une embuscade près de <i>Calvert.
J'ai dû contourner...
revenir par <i>Van Ness.
J'ai un demi-chevreuil cuit
à l'arrière.
<i>J'ai un demi-chevreuil cuit
à l'arrière.
<i>Tu rigoles ?
On en a bien besoin !
On a de la bouffe !
On mangera par équipe.
Ne relevez pas tout le monde
en même temps.
Plus un geste.
Lâchez vos armes.
Dans le camion.
Allez !
<i>Mes hommes me disent que
tout le bétail de </i>Hides
<i>a été abattu pour la nourriture.
Vraiment ?
Je ne pense pas, mais...
je vais me renseigner.
Parlons de la mine de sel.
Vous détenez déjà 25% de la mine.
On peut pas en rester là ?
<i>Que cherchez-vous à faire, Gray ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
<i>La négociation est terminée.
Non, Phil, attendez.
<i>Vous avez 30 secondes, Gray,
et j'envoie d'autres obus.
On a presque un accord, Phil.
Allez !
Ils sont là !
Ils sont dans le camp !
Je boucle le camp.
Allez. Levez-vous !
Où est Jonah, bordel ?
Il veut éviter les tirs croisés.
Cessez le feu !
Cessez le feu !
Stop !
Celui-ci est à vous.
On se revoit au camp.
Attends.
De quoi tu parles ?
Le contrat a changé.
C'est quoi ce bordel !
Nouvel arrangement,
je prends les armes, la nourriture,
l'essence, les flingues, tout.
- C'était 50-50.
- Et qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
Vous, vous serez à l'abri
des bombes.
Écoute, Jonah...
Tout ne va pas s'arranger
comme ça.
On a besoin de ces armes !
Pourquoi tu fais ça ?
Tu me dois bien plus que ça.
Je suis un voleur, pas un soldat.
Tu as promis de nous aider.
Écoute, tu ne devrais pas
rester près de moi.
Tu es une institutrice, chérie.
Une institutrice.
Va-t-en.
On le laisse filer comme ça ?
On a besoin de ces armes.
Des armes...
c'est pas un problème.
Tu avais tout ça,
et tu n'as jamais rien dit ?
Je ne pensais pas qu'un jour
je serais chez moi dans cette ville.
Il n'y a plus qu'à les charger.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fout ?
Pourquoi il n'a pas tiré ces mortiers ?
On les a détruits ?
Il nous aurait contactés.
On a neutralisé les mortiers.
Putain, ouais.
<i>Vous êtes là ?
<i>Vous allez devoir assumer vos actes.
<i>Il n'est plus question de marché,
plus de pitié.
<i>Nous arrivons.
<i>C'est la guerre.
<i>Vous m'entendez, Gray ?
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Stanley, ramène tous ceux
que tu trouveras.
Je vais coordonner
toutes les patrouilles.
La plupart d'entre vous n'a aucune idée
de ce qu'ils doivent faire,
ou de ce qui va arriver.
Certains le savent.
Ce n'est pas un combat
pour nos terres
ou pour notre ville.
C'est une lutte pour notre survie.
Priez pour nous tous.
Et priez également pour
les hommes et femmes de New Bern.
Priez Dieu de nous pardonner.
Toutes les personnes aptes...
qui ont besoin d'une arme...
de 16 ans ou plus...
mettez-vous en ligne.

<i>Previously on</i> Jericho
Hello, Jonah.
Guy did four years at Lansing
for extortion and assault.
Why are you talking to him?
It's okay, all right?
It didn't have anything to do with you.
He's my father...
it has everything to do with me.
Jonah agrees to leave town
and not come back.
Exile.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No, the question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?
No, I m still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?
Probably sometime tomorrow.
All right, let's get it up
as fast as we can.
Can we bust some more
of these things?
You got one of the only salt mines
around for 400 miles.
We're going to need food.
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, look, we'll give you the food.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.
You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliced it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
There was going to be
an explosion in town.
Hopefully, we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.
Everybody, go!
All right, keep alert.
Jake said the New Bern guys
might be coming right behind them.
Maybe they're already here.
What is that?
What happened?
We got a major problem, Gray.
Where's Eric?
He's fine.
He's at the med center.
Well, is it about the mine?
It's a lot worse than that.
Who are you?
Stop moving.
You hear me?
I'm talking to you.
Freeze!
Who are you?
I think we killed...
six in New Bern.
I counted eight.
Who's this?
Says he's from New Bern.
Wanted to talk to you.
What is this about?
<i>Am I speaking to Gray Anderson?
<i>This is Phil Constantino.
<i>Henry, you can
come home now, son.
<i>We're still cleaning the blood
of eight deputies
<i>off the sidewalks of New Bern,
<i>so you need to understand
our position.
<i>We need seven farms,
<i>including the Jackson farm,
<i>the Herbert farm,
<i>and the Richmond farm.
And we need half the salt mine.
You have four hours to respond.
I don't understand.
What are you asking us to do?
Jericho is about to be invaded.
For the sake of your people,
I'm asking you...
to surrender.

We have border patrol on duty
at all the checkpoints
and all the new roadblocks,
but we're scrambling
to cover everywhere else.
- Did you see anything out there?
- No, nothing.
What is he actually going to do?
Just march in here and
start shooting us?
We were high school football rivals
five months ago.
They tortured my brother to find out
how many troops we have, what weapons.
They have made hundreds of mortars.
My guess says they can hit
from as far as...
two miles out.
Having them and using them on people
are two different things.
That's what they said
about nuclear bombs.
How much time left?
50 minutes.
<i>Haven't been able to get a pulse
from this baby for an hour.
<i>Respiration is 16, pulse is 84.
<i>Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.
Just hold the pressure.
Put pressure right there,
right there.
Press.
Harder. Damn it!
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?
- I am trying to save April.
-<i> The baby's heart has stopped.
- What do you mean it's stopped?
- Do something.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's get you fixed up, okay?
Come on, sweetheart.
We're not going to give anything
to these people.
Mrs. Herbert?
I just wanted to offer the town
a solution.
You cannot give away that farm.
Gray said it's too far out of town
for the rangers to help.
I can't stand out there with a rifle.
- Then I'll defend it.
- Really?
Are you abandoning it?
The bank owns half of that farm anyway.
You just...
do whatever you want, Dale.
Wait, let's be clear.
If I defend it, then it's all mine.
If you can defend it.
Dale, how are we going
to defend that farm?
Get me every refugee you can find.
All right.
Careful.
I was so scared.
When you didn't come back, I thought...
I'm back.
Oh, God!
I'm sorry.
I don't want to hurt you.
I'm okay.
Listen up! Guys!
They said you had some food here.
Yeah... I do have food.
As of this morning, I own
the second biggest farm in Jericho.
Now...
I'm going to need men to defend it
if we're invaded.
What do we get?
The promise of three meals a day.
You want us to risk our lives
for a promise?
No way.
Guys, listen, listen!
Since you've been here, you've been
asking for a place to live, food.
You came here as refugees,
and you're still being treated
like second-class citizens.
That's no way to live.
If you fight for my farm and we win,
then everybody gets an equal split
It'll be your farm.
You'll have a stake in this town
that nobody can take away from you.
You'll never have to ask anyone
for anything ever again.
So...
who wants a future?
Constantin said four hours.
It's already been four hours.
You okay?
Come here.
What do we hear from the rangers?
Runners came in.
They haven't seen anything.
Should we call Constantino?
I don't have anything to tell him.
And I'm not just going
to give the town away.
There's something I need to tell you.
It's crazy. Everybody's saying
that New Bern's going to attack us.
We don't know. Look...
Something happened to Heather.
She found out New Bern
was building mortars.
She tried to stop them and they...
they caught her.
Nobody's seen her since.
- What did they do to her?
- I don't know.
Is she dead?
Jake, is she dead?
Get away from the windows!
Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?
- I'm good. I'm good.
Wait here.
Are you okay?
Somebody help!
Mom.
Mom!
Cover your eyes!
Jake, you okay?
Honey?
- Mom.
- Sweetheart, look at me.
- Look at me.
- I can't hear.
I know, sweetie.
That'll come back.
- We're right here, Mom.
- What's happening?
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be fine.
Let's get you to the med center,
honey.
Come on.
Get everybody off the street.
There might be more coming.
We got to open the shelters
and the town hall
and the medical center...
Move!
Constantino.
He's on the radio.
Constantino, you son of a bitch,
what the hell are you doing?
<i>I'm sorry for your troubles.
We got a dozen injured people
on the street here.
<i>I warned you what would happen
if you didn't meet our demands.
Demands?
I will make it my,
my purpose in life
to see that you are held accountable
for what you've just done.
<i>Take another hour...
Do not fire any more
of those things in here!
<i>One hour, Gray.
<i>We need seven farms.
<i>It was just two mortars this time.
<i>Next time there'll be three.
Try to retaliate,
or refuse our demands,
we'll send more.
We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.
The patrols said that it looked like
they were fired from the west.
Get as many rangers as you can,
all right, go out there,
find those mortars.
And we are gonna take them out!
Move!
Come on.
- Darcy, are you okay ?
- Yeah, but what happened ?
It's New Bern.
They're firing mortars at us.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!
Look, we've got to get the kids
and you got to get out of here.
Where are we going to go?
There's a safe house I know of.
If we could just get there.
It's in Montana.
Go to Montana on these roads?
What are our chances
of getting there?
I don't know.
- You heard from Constantino?
- No, no, but I...
sent out a squad of rangers
to try to take out the mortars.
I should have been with them.
You weren't here,
and I couldn't wait.
What should we do?
I don't know.
We've got to get underground, now.
Everybody!
You have got to get underground.
You, get everybody underground.
Let's go home.
Let's go home.
Okay.
I have to get back to town.
Sam, get away fromhere.
Dad, there's more water in the garage.
You want me to get it?
That is the safest room
in the house.
It's concrete, rebar, reinforced.
That's where we should be, D.
Come on.
Come on in.
This is cool!
Sam, Allison, go in the other room.
- Why can't...
- Come on, Sam. Let's go.
But this room's boring.
No more secrets.
Those mortars didn't come
from very far off.
- How much time do we have?
- About four minutes left.
<i>This is Stanley Richmond.
Mayor Anderson, can you hear me?
- We hear you.
- <i>Okay,
<i>we're about 100 yards away
from the mortar cannons.
<i>There's two of them,
sitting on the back of a flatbed truck.
Where are you, Stanley?
<i>We're in the woods
by the old </i>Shaw Creek Bridge,
<i>about two miles west of town.
<i>There's out ten men
guarding the truck.
- <i>They're arked in a clearing.</i>
- Can you get to them?
<i>Yeah, I think so. There's a path
leading into the clearing.
Tell him he's got to send scouts out
on both flanks.
There's no time to reposition.
They have to know
what they're going into.
I'm not gonna give them
another chance to drop bombs on us.
Gray, these men are not soldiers...
Johnston, you can stay or you can go,
but how this happens is my call.
- Stanley, get out of there. Don't do!
- Let go!
<i>What should we do?
Take 'em out.
<i>Got it.
So why now?
You know I always thought
that I could keep you safe.
But now, uh, today...
I'm just not so sure.
Nothing is safe.
Not anymore.
But, you know, in...
in the middle of all of this...
in this madness...
the only thing that make sense to me,
I mean really, the...
only thing...
is you and the kids.
It took me a while to realize
that and I'm...
sorry.
I am...
so sorry.
I missed you.
I missed you.
How do we know if it worked?
Come on.
Is he shot?
Sit down. Sit down.
Get him to the med center.
Is he all right?
Are you shot?
Where's everybody else?
Stanley, what happened out there?
I don't know.
We were moving
towards the mortar truck
and they were waiting,
they were waiting
on both sides of it for us.
They wouldn't...
they wouldn't stop firing.
Stanley, where's everybody else?
Where are they, son?
They're...
they're all dead.
They're all dead.
This is insane.
This is insane!
You son of a bitch!
Back off. Hold on.
Hold on.
Bailey's... now.
Stanley said the mortars were
on trucks here,
right here, just east
of Shaw Creek Bridge.
They're going to fire and move.
Check the tracks, see which
direction they were headed.
And Jake, just scout them.
We're not not going to do
anything else half-cocked.
First, we find 'em, then
we'll formulate a plan of attack.
Got it.
Just scout 'em.
I'm coming with you.
It was not a request.
All right.
From the tracks, I'd say three,
maybe four trucks
headed down that fire road.
They could hit the town from anywhere
once they get to Route 6.
Hawkins spotted a five-ton truck
coming this way from New Bern
about three miles back
Could be a supply truck
heading to the next mortar site.
We can get it.
All right. Let's go.
Stop the truck now!
Stop it!
They're all right.
Let 'em go.
You two finally turned to
a life of crime.
We're going to need
your men, Dale.
My men don't fight for
Gray Anderson.
We're asking you
to help defend the town.
We lose, you don't have anything.
If we fight with you,
we keep Mrs. Herbert's farm.
And we get the abandoned
Surrey farm also.
You already own half a salt mine,
and a percentage of every farm
in the county. Now you want more?
- It's just business.
- This isn't about business.
I'm asking you to do this for me.
We need your help.
Let's get ready to move.
They'll be looking for this truck.
Last time I was in town,
those people were trying to lynch me.
They can all go to hell.
Just listen to me.
No, you listen to me.
I've been watching New Bern
moving weapons
and supplies around here
for the last three days.
This is going to be a bloodbath.
The best thing you can do
is come with me.
Jericho's my home.
And I'm your father.
It's survival of the fastest
and strongest out here.
You think I'm safer with you,
robbing trucks?
I haven't lost a man yet.
And if New Bern doesn't get Jericho,
somebody else will.
Come with me.
Give us the maps,
help us take out the mortars,
help us fight.
We'll give you half.
Half of all weapons,
food and fuel that we take.
And if New Bern's army's as
big as you say it is,
you'll do whole lot better than
hitting one truck at a time out here.
You got more of me in you
than you're ever going to admit.
Change of plans!
When the federal government
comes back, we have our deeds.
We get our farms back then.
What if the government
doesn't come back?
What if this is the way it stays?
But they are coming here
intent on killing us.
Gray says we're only
three farms away from a deal.
And besides,
we're not prepared to fight.
I will get us prepared.
You talk to those farmers,
you don't let them give in.
Who else you got willing
to fight, Johnston?
The cops?
The rangers?
Dad?
There are 11 potential mortar sites.
Question is, which one is next?
Driver said... this one.
If we can trust him.
How were the trucks guarded?
- They have men hidden in the brush.
- I'm not sure I'm taking your deal.
They have nearly 30 guys guarding
that mortar truck.
I see nine here.
Gray's got the seven farmers he needs.
He's going to call New Bern
and give them up.
Surrenders those farms,
New Bern will occupy them in 30 minutes.
We'll never get rid of them.
So, what do we do?
I guess I'm about to make
a deal with the devil.
You flatter me.
get back over to town hall,
do whatever it takes,
but don't let Gray make that call.
What do you mean, do whatever
it takes? What are you saying?
I'm saying it's time to pick a side.
Why'd you bring Grey in here?
They just want to talk
to you for a second.
Don't make that deal
with Constantino.
It's not a debate.
If you make this deal, they're not
going to stop with seven farms.
People are going to starve
to death, Gray.
And that's if they don't kill us
outright when the food gets scarce.
I need you to leave.
- Now!
- Come on, Gray.
Why are you so ready to give up?
I almost gave my life
for this town, Gray.
You better listen to me,
you understand?
- It wasn't your fault those men died.
- Get 'em out of here!
Get them out of here!
You're going to listen
to what I have to say.
It's not your fault.
Calm down!
Put 'em down!
Put 'em down!
We have men out there, Gray.
What?
We have men out there.
Put 'em down!
- Brooks, put 'em down!
- You, too. Put 'em down..
Who is out there ?
Who is out there and
what are they doing?
Jake, Hawkins, my dad.
And they're going to try
and take out the mortars.
The three of them?
What do they think they're going to do?
You cannot give up those farms.
- Do you understand?
- We can't fight!
We can't fight.
You saw what happened this morning.
We're not ready for this.
I have been talking to Constantino,
and I promised him that
we will not retaliate
if he just gives us time
to put this deal together.
We've got maps of all
of New Bern's positions.
- Supply line, everything.
- Where did you get this stuff?
We've got trucks. We've got fuel.
We've got guns.
What are you talking about?
Where did you get all this?
Jonah Prowse is fighting with us.
He's got about 30 men
fighting with him. 30 men!
Well, they can get us all killed.
<i>This is New Bern. Over.
Don't go near that radio, Gray.
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?
Johnston Green, right?
Two years ago,  you came over
to New Bern and finished fourth
in a bass fishing contest
up at Big Hill Lake.
I finished second.
Let's go.
<i>Mayor Anderson,
your time is running out.
She tried to tell Constantino
that I did not send them out there.
Gray, don't make that deal.
Buy some time to take out those mortars.
Negotiate with Constantino.
So, we pop out of here,
it gets bad, Jonah going
will have our backs, right?
You are filling me
with confidence, Jake.
Emily's with him.
He'll be there.
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here, Phil.
<i>What's your decision?
You're a good businessman, Gray.
You know how to do it.
Well, we don't want to fight.
So,
what about the... Levine
and Hides Dairy farms,
in-instead of the Richmond farm?
<i>That's less acreage.
Yeah, I know, but...
then you would have a dairy
and a soybean farm,
and also Hides has 50 acres of corn,
and I got to tell you, that deal would
be a lot easier to sell to my people.
Where you been?
Supposed to be here three hours ago.
I got sniped at by
a gang over near Calvert.
Had to come all the way back around
through... back through Van Ness.
Got a half a barbecued venison in back.
You're kidding?
God, we need it.
We got chow!
We'll eat in shifts.
Don't pull everybody off
the perimeter at the same time.
Don't move.
And drop your weapons.
Get in the truck.
Move!
<i>My people are telling me
that all the cattle out
<i>at Hides farm have been
slaughtered for food.
Really?
I don't think so, but
I can find out for you.
Let's talk about the salt mine now.
You've already got 25% of the mine.
Can't we just leave it at that?
<i>What are you doing, Gray?
What are you talking about?
<i>This negotiation is over.
No, Phil, come on.
<i>30 seconds, Gray,
or I send more mortars.
We almost have a deal here, Phil.
Come on!
They're here!
They're in the camp!
I'm closing the camp!
Come on. Get up there!
Where the hell is Jonah?
He doesn't want to get hit
in our crossfire.
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Stop!
This one's yours.
Meet you back at the camp.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
Deal's changed.
The hell it has.
It's a new split:
I get all the weapons, the food,
the fuel, the guns, everything.
- Deal's 50-50.
- And what do we get?
You get to have bombs
not falling on your head.
Listen here, Jonah...
This is about to get a lot worse.
We need those guns!
Why are you doing this?
You owe me a lot more than that!
I am a thief, not a soldier.
You promised you'd help us.
Look, you shouldn't be near me.
You're a schoolteacher, kid.
A schoolteacher.
Go on.
We're just gonna let him go?
We need those guns.
Guns.
Guns are easy.
You had this the whole time
and you didn't say anything?
I never thought I was gonna call
this town my home.
Let's get them loaded up.
What's he doing?
Why hasn't he fired the mortars?
Did we take them out?
He would have come back
on the radio.
We took out the mortars.
Hell, yeah.
<i>Are you there?
<i>Now, you've brought this on yourself.
<i>There's no deals, no mercy.
<i>We're coming.
<i>This means war.
<i>Do you hear me, Gray?
I need your help.
Stanley, get me every
runner you can find.
I want to get orders out
to all the patrols.
Most of you have no idea what to do
or what's coming.
Some of you do.
This isn't a fight about land
or about this town.
This is a fight for our very existence.
Pray for each other.
While you're at it, pray for the men
and women of New Bern.
Pray that God forgives us.
Every able-bodied person...
who needs a gun...
16 years of age or older...
line up.

<i>Précédemment dans </i>Jericho
Oh, mon Dieu... Ted !
On a grandi ensemble à New Bern.
- Tu veux partir ?
- Ce ne sera pas très long.
Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les élections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
Ils en avaient marre
de leur shérif ?
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
10 éoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la récolte.
C'est bon, on vous donnera
la nourriture.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
On n'était plus
en sécurité là-bas.
<i>Tu ne peux pas aller à New Bern,
et faire ta petite guerre, Jake.</i>
Un inventaire complet des
ressources de Jericho.
Partagée, comme si
elle leur appartenait !
Ils fabriquent des obus
de mortiers.
Ils se préparent pour
une guerre !
Lâche ça !
On voulait détruire leurs machines.
Arrêter leur usine.
Où est Heather ?
Elle est morte, Jake.
On y va !
<i>Jericho va être envahie.
<i>Nous continuerons jour et nuit
aussi longtemps que nécessaire.</i>
La plupart d'entre vous n'a aucune idée
de ce qui va arriver.
Ce n'est pas un combat
pour nos terres.
C'est une lutte pour notre survie.
<i>6 ANS PLUS TÔT
Je sais que c'est très
artistique, mais...
Je vais bientôt quitter ces chaussures,
alors pour éviter de voir mes orteils...
Gail, mettez-vous à l'aise.
On ne peut pas faire ça
sans le témoin non plus.
Où est Jake ?
Je ne l'ai pas vu.
Grand-père est absent lui aussi.
Essayez de deviner où ils sont.
Très bien.
Beth. C'est si gentil d'être
venue, très chère.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
On doit aller à l'hôpital.
- Tout le monde est là ?
- Ouais, on t'attendait.
Comment ça se passe dehors ?
Ils ont pris la ferme des Talbot.
Combien étaient-ils ?
Je dirais 60... 70.
C'est sûrement une équipe d'éclaireurs.
Je suppose qu'ils ont beaucoup
plus d'hommes en chemin.
Constantino nous dépasse
en nombre et en armement.
Si on se divise pour défendre
chacune de ces fermes,
il va nous écraser.
Alors, on fait quoi ?
On ne se disperse pas.
Nous choisissons un endroit
où rester tous ensemble,
pour leur donner du fil à retordre,
qu'ils comprennent
que s'ils veulent en découdre,
ça leur coûtera cher, très cher.
Comment ?
Juste ici.
La ferme de Stanley Richmond.
Au-delà, la route se sépare,
et ils gagnent du terrain
trop vite pour nous.
En plus, c'est le point le plus
élevé de toute la région.
C'est là que nous nous posterons.

<i>6 ANS PLUS TÔT
- Grand père, t'es saoul.
- Ouais !
Merci, ma belle.
Continue à en amener.
Gail va vous en vouloir
d'avoir saoulé son fils.
J'ai Gail dans la poche.
Il disait pareil quand il m'a fait
piloter la première fois à 13 ans.
Il lui a même dit que
je mentais quand j'en ai parlé.
J'étais tellement jaloux.
Maman savait que vous le faisiez voler,
et elle ne voulait plus
que je m'approche de vous.
En plus,
Jake me racontait
toutes vos histoires.
J'ai adoré...
J'ai adoré celle des boulons.
Mais de quoi vous parlez ?
Les boulons...
la Seconde Guerre mondiale !
Il veut parler des clous,
Grand-père.
Pas des boulons.
Rien à voir.
Alors, c'était quoi l'histoire ?
Racontez-moi...
Quoi ?
C'est son histoire.
Très bien.
Seconde guerre mondiale.
Hiver 1944.
Les nazis avaient franchi
les lignes alliées,
et encerclèrent...
une division américaine
dans la petite ville de Bastogne,
Gelés, mourant de faim et à court
de munitions, mais ils savaient...
qu'ils devaient tenir cette position.
Quelques jours avant Noël,
les nazis ont envoyé un mot
au commandant américain,
lui disant qu'il pouvait
se rendre et sauver le
reste de ses hommes,
ou rester et se battre.
Le commandant américain
a envoyé un seul et unique mot comme
réponse au commandant de la Wehrmacht,
et qui disait...
- ... "Des clous."
Pourquoi "Des clous." ?
Ça signifiait, "Va en Enfer !"
Pourquoi il a pas dit
"Va en Enfer" ?
Parce qu'il a dit, "Des clous".
Gail, ma chérie,
tu es ravissante.
Économise-toi, Dal.
C'était ton idée de rendre
mon fils saoul ce soir ?
Très bien. D'accord.
Tout le monde retourne à la réception.
- Venez.
- Mais j'ai mal au crâne.
Et je dois te parler.
Prends du café, Stanley.
Tiens.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
En tant que témoin de ton frère,
tu dois porter un toast,
alors j'ai écrit quelques pensées,
des choses
que tu pourrais vouloir dire.
Tu pensais que j'allais tout gâcher ?
Allons prendre quelques photos, OK ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
M. Green, j'ai accès à un réseau
de satellites militaires,
je peux l'utiliser pour surveiller
les mouvements de New Bern.
- Pardon ?
- C'est vrai.
La seule restriction...
c'est que personne ne sache d'où
vous viennent ces informations.
Dites que je suis parti en éclaireur,
dites-leur ce que vous voulez...
mais le satellite doit rester
confidentiel.
Ça me va.
- C'est tout ?
- Quoi d'autre ?
C'est bon. Il a un satellite,
et ça doit rester secret.
- Mais...
- Je vais mener une guerre,
contre New Bern, Kansas,
nos voisins les plus proches.
J'ai déjà du mal à supporter
cette ironie du sort.
Je ne me pose plus de questions.
Maman, Papa,
il est possible que nous
devions partir aujourd'hui,
et que nous ne puissions
pas revenir, donc...
Je voulais juste...
On voulait...
vous rendre honneur.
Vous vous souvenez de cette
sorcière, celle du fisc ?
Celle qui voulait...
vous prendre tout
ce que vous aviez construit ?
Maman, Papa...
voici Mimi.
Bonjour.
Je suis heureuse
de vous rencontrer enfin.
J'aime vraiment votre fils.
Et, bien sûr, Bonnie est...
elle est adorable.
Et j'ai vraiment adoré
vivre avec eux et...
- Super !
- Quoi ?
Je n'ai pas dit que nous
vivions ensemble.
Nous ne sommes pas mariés.
Je suis désolée.
Je ne voulais pas... Je...
Il n'y a rien de sérieux à tes yeux ?
Je me dis qu'un jour
nous serons enterrés ici.
Et je...
pensais que ce serait super...
que nos enfants viennent, et
se mettent à plaisanter avec nous.
J'espère que ce ne sera
pas avant longtemps.
Comment ça se passe ?
On a presque 200 hommes,
y compris l'équipe de Dale.
D'autres vont venir, non ?
Petit à petit, ça va prendre
plus de temps qu'on le pensait.
Les adieux à leurs familles.
Allez voir si tout le monde
est prêt là-bas.
On a peu de temps avant
que leurs hommes arrivent.
- Pas toi.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que tous ces gens t'ont élu.
On te protègera coûte que coûte.
En plus, je vais avoir besoin
de ton aide.
Aide pour quoi ?
Armer notre tank.
<i>"Entrez les coordonnées :"
Notre fille est dehors,
avec un fusil et... je suis ici.
Sam a besoin de toi ici.
Tu sais, Allie ne craint rien.
Elle est affectée à la mairie,
à des kilomètres
des premiers combats.
Pour l'instant, tu n'as pas
grand-chose d'autre à faire.
Les voilà.
<i>Jake, vous allez avoir
de la compagnie.
Déjà ?
<i>New Bern est en route.
Il y a...
<i>70, peut-être... 80 hommes.
Est-ce que le tank est arrivé ?
Ils sont en train d'essayer
de le charger avec les obus de mortier.
Je pense que vous en aurez besoin.
Attention, tenez-vous prêt !
Ils arrivent !
Apportez des munitions ici !
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
On essaye de me localiser.
Localiser ?
C'est-à-dire ?
Quelqu'un essaye de repérer
ma position via le satellite.
- Ils peuvent faire ça ?
- S'ils ont assez de temps, oui.
Tu sais qui fait ça ?
Je pense que c'est... Valente.
Qui, lui ?
La Sécurité Intérieure ?
Je ne sais plus trop
pour qui il travaille,
mais il voulait
que Sarah récupère la bombe,
et qu'elle élimine tous les témoins.
Tous les témoins.
- Éteins ça.
- Non, je ne peux pas.
Il suffira que je me déconnecte avant
qu'ils finissent de nous localiser.
Je comprends pas.
- Pourquoi ils restent là ?
- Je sais pas.
On tire les premiers ?
New Bern arrive.
Mettez-vous en position.
On va avoir besoin de ce tank !
Tu passes du bon temps ?
Ouais.
Au fait, je crois que j'ai vu April
s'envoyer en l'air avec Shep Cale.
Il faut que t'arrêtes de boire.
Écoute.
Lis ça.
C'est un discours.
Si tu as quelque chose de prêt,
tu seras moins gêné.
Tu ne seras pas gêné,
tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter.
Ça s'écrit comme ça
"maladie vénérienne" ?
C'est un jour important pour moi, OK ?
C'est pas parce que
ta vie est une blague
que tu dois traiter la mienne pareil.
Pourquoi ma vie serait une blague ?
- Lis juste ça.
- Non, sérieusement...
- Pourquoi ma vie serait une blague ?
- Je vais pas en discuter maintenant.
D'accord.
Tu crois que les gens
ne se demandent pas ce que t'as fait ?
Tout ce temps passé pour avoir
ton brevet de pilote,
et au lieu d'en profiter, tu reviens ici
vivre comme si t'étais en vacances.
À traiter des affaires
pour le père d'Emily.
Si je suis une telle blague, alors
pourquoi tu m'as demandé comme témoin?
Tu voulais pas de moi, pas vrai ?
Non, pas vraiment.
Où est ce tank ?
On ne va pas faire long feu
contre ces camions.
On doit tenir bon.
Putain !
Continuez à les occuper, OK ?
D'accord.
Donne-moi un autre chargeur.
Tu vas où ?
On n'a pas d'angle de tir ici.
Je vais sur la colline,
pour neutraliser le tireur.
- Je te couvre.
- OK.
On le couvre !
Pourquoi éliminer les témoins ?
Quels que soient ceux qui te traquent,
ils voudront...
utiliser la bombe à des
fins personnelles ou...
t'empêcher de l'utiliser,
mais...
dans tous les cas,
pourquoi pas de témoins ?
Les bombes sont marquées, non ?
Quelque chose...
les rend traçables.
Je me souviens d'avoir lu ça.
C'est l'uranium.
Il a...
Il a une signature spécifique, qui..
indique l'endroit
où l'engin a été fabriqué.
Il y a eu une douzaine de ces trucs
utilisée dans les attaques, c'est ça ?
- Et à présent tu as la dernière.
- Ouais.
Je ne pense pas que ces gens
en ont après l'arme...
C'est plus que ça.
C'est...
...une preuve.
C'est la preuve tangible
du plus grand crime
dans l'histoire du monde.
La bombe...
elle peut trahir les gens qui sont
responsables de ces attaques.
C'est pour ça qu'ils veulent
la reprendre.
T'as vu ça ?
La vache !
C'était...
<i>La vache !
Ça va nous faire
gagner un peu de temps.
Mais ils reviendront,
encore plus nombreux.
Ce sera moins facile
la prochaine fois.
Facile?
T'as trouvé ça facile?
Papa ?
Ça ne va pas ?
Débarrassez la table !
Je vais chercher Kenchy.
- Trouve ma mère !
- ll faut des serviettes.
Des antiseptiques,
et de l'alcool.
- On a besoin d'alcool.
- Une serviette !
Trouvez-moi de l'alcool !
C'est parti.
Donne-moi ça. Allez.
OK, c'est bon.
Continue d'appuyer.
- Quoi ?
- Continue ! Continue d'appuyer.
<i>Jake, à toi.
Vous avez fait du bon boulot.
<i>Dis à ton père qu'ils reviennent.
Il s'est fait tiré dessus.
Je suis désolé.
Tu sais quoi faire, hein ?
<i>Appuie sur la blessure,
<i>et il doit y avoir de la morphine
dans les affaires que je t'ai données.
Ouais, on l'a.
Écoute, Jake.
Les gens vont se tourner
vers toi désormais.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Bon, les mecs vont revenir.
Ils se sont réfugiés
à la ferme des Talbot.
Je pense qu'ils attendent des renforts,
donc vous avez un peu de temps
pour vous regrouper.
<i>Garde la radio près de toi,
et je te tiendrais au courant.
Terminé.
Terminé.
S'il vous plait,
je dois parler à un responsable.
Là-bas.
Excusez-moi, monsieur ?
Colonel Hoffman.
Ne m'appelez Monsieur,
que si vous avez prévu de vous engager.
Il y a une usine à munitions
dans une ville qui s'appelle New Bern.
Ils ont prévu d'envahir la ville
de Jericho. Des gens vont mourir.
Ils ont essayé de me tuer,
mais j'ai pu m'enfuir.
- Vous devez aider ces personnes.
- Où est-ce ?
Kansas, pas loin de
la frontière du Colorado.
J'aimerais vous aider, mais je dois
sécuriser les routes dans le coin.
- Mais...
- Je ne peux en décider.
Je ne suis qu'un employé
du gouvernement.
Quel gouvernement ?
États-Unis.
Tout va bien, madame ?
On nous avait dit que 6 personnes
revendiquaient la présidence.
Il y avait. En réalité, il ne reste
que quelques résistants...
Texas, un front à l'Est.
Le nouveau gouvernement fédéral
a été rétabli à Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Colonel, ceci est une urgence.
Vous devez y aller.
La bataille a peut-être déjà commencé.
Je suis vraiment désolé, madame.
Casper, assurez-vous qu'elle
retourne au centre médical.
Venez, madame.
Faites-les sortir.
Faites-les sortir.
Sortez, tout le monde.
Écoutez...
Cet endroit...
est votre salut.
Défendez-le, entendu ?
On le fera.
Je suis désolé de vous infliger ça.
Vous avez traversé assez d'épreuves.
Papa...
Papa, arrête.
Tu es plus fort que tu ne le penses.
Tu l'as toujours été.
Je t'aime, fiston.
Je crois que j'ai zigué quand
j'aurais dû zaguer dehors, non ?
J'aimerais que votre mère soit là.
Elle arrive.
Elle sera là.
Dites à votre mère que je l'aime.
J'ai été... dur avec toi.
Je t'ai forcé... à t'éloigner.
Je suis heureux que tu...sois...
revenu à la maison.
Je suis fier de toi.
Le grand moment.
Avant de commencer,
y a-t-il quelqu'un...
qui ne m'a pas écrit
de discours ?
Je suis surpris de voir à quel point
vous me trouvez dérangé,
et qu'on me fasse si peu confiance
pour dire quelques mots...
à propos de mon frère.
Le truc c'est que...
tout ça est assez nul.
Aucun n'a mentionné la période
théâtre musical de mon frère,
quand nous pensions tous
qu'il était gay.
Sérieusement.
Vous avez échappé au pire,
tant que vous ne l'avez pas entendu
chanter "One Hand, One Heart"
sous la douche tous les matins.
Je taquine pas mal mon frère,
mais...
la vérité c'est...
la vérité c'est que
je suis très fier de lui.
Je suis...
Je suis fier de sa gentillesse.
Je suis fier de sa générosité.
Et...
c'est un homme très chanceux.
Vraiment.
Mon père est mort.
Le combat continue.
Ramenez Gray en ville.
Quoi ?
Attends une minute...
Viens demain, ceux qui restent
auront besoin d'un leader.
Je pense qu'on a eu assez de perte
pour aujourd'hui.
On a besoin de tous
les bras disponibles.
- Je ne vais nulle part.
- Tu es trop important, Gray.
- Ce n'est pas négociable.
- Donnez-lui une escorte.
Et que tout le monde
rejoigne son poste.
On ne sait pas quand
ils reviendront.
Vas-y.
<i>Leurs renforts sont là.
200 hommes.
<i>Et près d'un millier en plus.
<i>Ils se préparent en ce moment,
je dirai que vous avez 15...
<i>peut-être 20 minutes
avant qu'ils soient sur vous.
Reviens ici le plus vite possible, OK ?
Tu as des infos sur le chemin de fer,
celui qui longe la rivière ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu vois quoi ?
<i>Il y a quoi sur les voies ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne vois plus rien.
- Attends...
- Robert, déconnecte-le.
Il y a un train venant de New Bern,
<i>avec 3 wagons de marchandises.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils transportent ?
Des hommes je pense...
des centaines.
Ce sont encore d'autres renforts !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Parle-moi !
Je te rejoins.
Je dois y aller.
Attends.
Ils n'ont eu que
quelques secondes,
ce n'est pas assez pour
une localisation précise.
- On est en sécurité pour un moment.
- Où vas-tu ?
Je dois stopper un train.
I-80 est sécurisé de Cheyenne
à Grand Island.
On contrôle maintenant la zone entre
Kearney et Hastings.
La situation sur l'I-70
va devenir délicate.
Il y a des gangs organisés qui
contrôlent la plupart des échangeurs.
J'ai aussi été prévenu par
une patiente du centre médical,
que l'on pouvait s'attendre à un
conflit entre deux villes...
au nord-ouest du Kansas.
New Bern et Jericho.
Quel est l'emplacement de ces villes ?
CZ-12, quadrant 4.
Nous avons repéré un suspect terroriste
dans les 320 Km de cette zone.
La capture de ce suspect
est de haute priorité
pour l'administration
du Président Tomarchio.
Vous me comprenez ?
Dois-je changer nos priorités,
monsieur ?
Immédiatement.
Allez à Jericho,
et étouffez ce conflit.
Une fois la zone dégagée,
Nous commencerons
les recherches sur ce terroriste.
Je vais demander à Mimi de m'épouser.
Sérieux ?
Ouais.
Elle sait pas cuisiner,
elle a jamais rien compris
au base-ball,
elle déteste mes vêtements...
mais je l'aime.
Et je suis heureux.
Jake, je veux pas
mourir aujourd'hui.
Tu vas t'en sortir.
Je te le promets.
Constantino se rapproche
avec ses camions.
- On a peu de temps.
- Et pour le train ?
À peu près 20 minutes.
Dis-moi que tu as un plan,
un vraiment bon.
J'aurai besoin de votre tank.
Il ne pourra rien tirer,
tu le sais, hein ?
Il n'y a pas de munitions dedans.
J'ai pas prévu de tirer
quoi que ce soit.
L'accélérateur est sur ta gauche,
et pour le diriger, t'as seulement à...
C'est pas la première fois.
Bonne chance.
Toi aussi.
C'est imminent, non ?
Je suis, euh...
Tu sais qu'il est là.
Il nous observe.
Tu le sais ça, pas vrai ?
Ils sautent encore comme des lapins
là-dedans ?
Je crois que c'est la Macarena.
La quoi ?
Ouais, ils sautent toujours
comme des lapins.
C'est un bon discours que t'as fait.
Je ne pensais pas que tu étais un de
ces idiots qui fait dans le sentimental.
- Maman l'a écrit.
- Tu crois ?
Écoute, je sais qu'Eric et toi
n'êtes pas si proches et...
peut-être que tu ne te sentais pas
d'être debout devant une foule et...
d'agir comme tu l'as fait.
Parfois, agir comme tu le ressens
et agir comme il se devrait
sont 2 choses différentes.
Tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter pour
moi, papa. Je vais bien.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi, je sens que
mon inquiétude est loin d'être terminée.
Mais elle le sera un jour.
Je sais qu'un jour tu deviendras
l'homme que j'ai toujours vu en toi,
l'homme que tu es censé être.
Mon Dieu, ce sera un jour mémorable.
Viens, Johnston.
Ce scotch ne va pas se boire tout seul.
Le vieux et moi allons vers le lac,
partager un whisky vieux de 30 ans.
Tu veux venir ?
Ouais. Je vais juste...
attendre Emily, lui dire bonne nuit.
Je te rejoins là-bas.
Je te garderai une place.
- Où va-t-il ?
- Il attend Emily pour dire bonne nuit.
C'est la dernière fois
qu'on le verra ce soir.
Si j'avais une copine
qui lui ressemblait,
je ne la ferais pas attendre.
T'entends ça, fiston ?
Je vais éloigner cette fille de toi.
Ouais, bien dit.
Tu devrais faire plus attention
à toi aussi.
Ta femme est folle de moi.
Elle serait capable
d'aller te voir 3 fois par jour.
C'est Constantino.
J'écoute.
<i>Mes éclaireurs viennent de m'informer.
<i>Je suis désolé pour ton père.
Jake, vous êtes à court de
munitions et d'hommes.
On est trop nombreux et trop
désespérés pour abandonner.
<i>Vous ne pouvez pas gagner.
<i>Je vous laisse une dernière chance.
<i>Partez,
déposez vos armes,
Partez,
déposez vos armes,
et rentrez chez vous,
et personne d'autre ne sera blessé.
Jake, j'ai besoin d'une réponse.
Quelle est ta décision ?
Des clous.
Désolé, j'ai pas bien compris.
Tu peux aller droit en enfer.
Et pour mon père...
c'est toi que je viendrai trouver.
Je veux rentrer chez moi.
Nous devons éloigner les gens
des zones de combat.
Vous serez plus en sécurité à Cheyenne.
Colonel Hoffman ?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Monsieur, départ dans 5 minutes.
- Reçu.
- Jericho est devenue notre priorité.
- Merci.
Dieu merci.
C'est grâce à vous.
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
Nous allons rétablir la situation.
En route.
Mon père voulait
que l'on prenne position ici.
Pour défendre nos maisons.
C'est ce que nous allons faire.
Fumigène !
Tous en position !
Ne gâchez pas vos balles !
Attendez le bon moment pour tirer !
Attendez...
Attendez...
Attendez...
Maintenant !

<i>Précédemment dans </i>Jericho
Oh, mon Dieu... Ted !
On a grandi ensemble à New Bern.
- Tu veux partir ?
- Ce ne sera pas très long.
Johnston, vieux chacal.
Comment as-tu pu perdre
les élections ?
Et toi ? Comment as-tu pu devenir
Maire de New Bern ?
Ils en avaient marre
de leur shérif ?
Peut-on en acheter d'autres ?
10 éoliennes pour, disons...
10% de la récolte.
C'est bon, on vous donnera
la nourriture.
On aura besoin de 10 de vos
gars pour les construire.
On n'était plus
en sécurité là-bas.
<i>Tu ne peux pas aller à New Bern,
et faire ta petite guerre, Jake.</i>
Un inventaire complet des
ressources de Jericho.
Partagée, comme si
elle leur appartenait !
Ils fabriquent des obus
de mortiers.
Ils se préparent pour
une guerre !
Lâche ça !
On voulait détruire leurs machines.
Arrêter leur usine.
Où est Heather ?
Elle est morte, Jake.
On y va !
<i>Jericho va être envahie.
<i>Nous continuerons jour et nuit
aussi longtemps que nécessaire.</i>
La plupart d'entre vous n'a aucune idée
de ce qui va arriver.
Ce n'est pas un combat
pour nos terres.
C'est une lutte pour notre survie.
<i>6 ANS PLUS TÔT
Je sais que c'est très
artistique, mais...
Je vais bientôt quitter ces chaussures,
alors pour éviter de voir mes orteils...
Gail, mettez-vous à l'aise.
On ne peut pas faire ça
sans le témoin non plus.
Où est Jake ?
Je ne l'ai pas vu.
Grand-père est absent lui aussi.
Essayez de deviner où ils sont.
Très bien.
Beth. C'est si gentil d'être
venue, très chère.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
On doit aller à l'hôpital.
- Tout le monde est là ?
- Ouais, on t'attendait.
Comment ça se passe dehors ?
Ils ont pris la ferme des Talbot.
Combien étaient-ils ?
Je dirais 60... 70.
C'est sûrement une équipe d'éclaireurs.
Je suppose qu'ils ont beaucoup
plus d'hommes en chemin.
Constantino nous dépasse
en nombre et en armement.
Si on se divise pour défendre
chacune de ces fermes,
il va nous écraser.
Alors, on fait quoi ?
On ne se disperse pas.
Nous choisissons un endroit
où rester tous ensemble,
pour leur donner du fil à retordre,
qu'ils comprennent
que s'ils veulent en découdre,
ça leur coûtera cher, très cher.
Comment ?
Juste ici.
La ferme de Stanley Richmond.
Au-delà, la route se sépare,
et ils gagnent du terrain
trop vite pour nous.
En plus, c'est le point le plus
élevé de toute la région.
C'est là que nous nous posterons.
L'adjoint Perkins vient d'appeler.
Il dit que la ferme est sécurisée.
Allons chercher les autres.

<i>6 ANS PLUS TÔT
- Grand père, t'es saoul.
- Ouais !
Merci, ma belle.
Continue à en amener.
Gail va vous en vouloir
d'avoir saoulé son fils.
J'ai Gail dans la poche.
Il disait pareil quand il m'a fait
piloter la première fois à 13 ans.
Il lui a même dit que
je mentais quand j'en ai parlé.
J'étais tellement jaloux.
Maman savait que vous le faisiez voler,
et elle ne voulait plus
que je m'approche de vous.
En plus,
Jake me racontait
toutes vos histoires.
J'ai adoré...
J'ai adoré celle des boulons.
Mais de quoi vous parlez ?
Les boulons...
la Seconde Guerre mondiale !
Il veut parler des clous,
Grand-père.
Pas des boulons.
Rien à voir.
Alors, c'était quoi l'histoire ?
Racontez-moi...
Quoi ?
C'est son histoire.
Très bien.
Seconde guerre mondiale.
Hiver 1944.
Les nazis avaient franchi
les lignes alliées,
et encerclèrent...
une division américaine
dans la petite ville de Bastogne,
Gelés, mourant de faim et à court
de munitions, mais ils savaient...
qu'ils devaient tenir cette position.
Quelques jours avant Noël,
les nazis ont envoyé un mot
au commandant américain,
lui disant qu'il pouvait
se rendre et sauver le
reste de ses hommes,
ou rester et se battre.
Le commandant américain
a envoyé un seul et unique mot comme
réponse au commandant de la Wehrmacht,
et qui disait...
- ... "Des clous."
Pourquoi "Des clous." ?
Ça signifiait, "Va en Enfer !"
Pourquoi il a pas dit
"Va en Enfer" ?
Parce qu'il a dit, "Des clous".
Gail, ma chérie,
tu es ravissante.
Économise-toi, Dal.
C'était ton idée de rendre
mon fils saoul ce soir ?
Très bien. D'accord.
Tout le monde retourne à la réception.
- Venez.
- Mais j'ai mal au crâne.
Et je dois te parler.
Prends du café, Stanley.
Tiens.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
En tant que témoin de ton frère,
tu dois porter un toast,
alors j'ai écrit quelques pensées,
des choses
que tu pourrais vouloir dire.
Tu pensais que j'allais tout gâcher ?
Allons prendre quelques photos, OK ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
M. Green, j'ai accès à un réseau
de satellites militaires,
je peux l'utiliser pour surveiller
les mouvements de New Bern.
- Pardon ?
- C'est vrai.
La seule restriction...
c'est que personne ne sache d'où
vous viennent ces informations.
Dites que je suis parti en éclaireur,
dites-leur ce que vous voulez...
mais le satellite doit rester
confidentiel.
Ça me va.
- C'est tout ?
- Quoi d'autre ?
C'est bon. Il a un satellite,
et ça doit rester secret.
- Mais...
- Je vais mener une guerre,
contre New Bern, Kansas,
nos voisins les plus proches.
J'ai déjà du mal à supporter
cette ironie du sort.
Je ne me pose plus de questions.
Maman, Papa,
il est possible que nous
devions partir aujourd'hui,
et que nous ne puissions
pas revenir, donc...
Je voulais juste...
On voulait...
vous rendre honneur.
Vous vous souvenez de cette
sorcière, celle du fisc ?
Celle qui voulait...
vous prendre tout
ce que vous aviez construit ?
Maman, Papa...
voici Mimi.
Bonjour.
Je suis heureuse
de vous rencontrer enfin.
J'aime vraiment votre fils.
Et, bien sûr, Bonnie est...
elle est adorable.
Et j'ai vraiment adoré
vivre avec eux et...
- Super !
- Quoi ?
Je n'ai pas dit que nous
vivions ensemble.
Nous ne sommes pas mariés.
Je suis désolée.
Je ne voulais pas... Je...
Il n'y a rien de sérieux à tes yeux ?
Je me dis qu'un jour
nous serons enterrés ici.
Et je...
pensais que ce serait super...
que nos enfants viennent, et
se mettent à plaisanter avec nous.
J'espère que ce ne sera
pas avant longtemps.
Comment ça se passe ?
On a presque 200 hommes,
y compris l'équipe de Dale.
D'autres vont venir, non ?
Petit à petit, ça va prendre
plus de temps qu'on le pensait.
Les adieux à leurs familles.
Allez voir si tout le monde
est prêt là-bas.
On a peu de temps avant
que leurs hommes arrivent.
- Pas toi.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que tous ces gens t'ont élu.
On te protègera coûte que coûte.
En plus, je vais avoir besoin
de ton aide.
Aide pour quoi ?
Armer notre tank.
<i>"Entrez les coordonnées :"
Notre fille est dehors,
avec un fusil et... je suis ici.
Sam a besoin de toi ici.
Tu sais, Allie ne craint rien.
Elle est affectée à la mairie,
à des kilomètres
des premiers combats.
Pour l'instant, tu n'as pas
grand-chose d'autre à faire.
Les voilà.
<i>Jake, vous allez avoir
de la compagnie.
Déjà ?
<i>New Bern est en route.
Il y a...
<i>70, peut-être... 80 hommes.
Est-ce que le tank est arrivé ?
Ils sont en train d'essayer
de le charger avec les obus de mortier.
Je pense que vous en aurez besoin.
Attention, tenez-vous prêt !
Ils arrivent !
Apportez des munitions ici !
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
On essaye de me localiser.
Localiser ?
C'est-à-dire ?
Quelqu'un essaye de repérer
ma position via le satellite.
- Ils peuvent faire ça ?
- S'ils ont assez de temps, oui.
Tu sais qui fait ça ?
Je pense que c'est... Valente.
Qui, lui ?
La Sécurité Intérieure ?
Je ne sais plus trop
pour qui il travaille,
mais il voulait
que Sarah récupère la bombe,
et qu'elle élimine tous les témoins.
Tous les témoins.
- Éteins ça.
- Non, je ne peux pas.
Il suffira que je me déconnecte avant
qu'ils finissent de nous localiser.
Je comprends pas.
- Pourquoi ils restent là ?
- Je sais pas.
On tire les premiers ?
New Bern arrive.
Mettez-vous en position.
On va avoir besoin de ce tank !
Tu passes du bon temps ?
Ouais.
Au fait, je crois que j'ai vu April
s'envoyer en l'air avec Shep Cale.
Il faut que t'arrêtes de boire.
Écoute.
Lis ça.
C'est un discours.
Si tu as quelque chose de prêt,
tu seras moins gêné.
Tu ne seras pas gêné,
tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter.
Ça s'écrit comme ça
"maladie vénérienne" ?
C'est un jour important pour moi, OK ?
C'est pas parce que
ta vie est une blague
que tu dois traiter la mienne pareil.
Pourquoi ma vie serait une blague ?
- Lis juste ça.
- Non, sérieusement...
- Pourquoi ma vie serait une blague ?
- Je vais pas en discuter maintenant.
D'accord.
Tu crois que les gens
ne se demandent pas ce que t'as fait ?
Tout ce temps passé pour avoir
ton brevet de pilote,
et au lieu d'en profiter, tu reviens ici
vivre comme si t'étais en vacances.
À traiter des affaires
pour le père d'Emily.
Si je suis une telle blague, alors
pourquoi tu m'as demandé comme témoin?
Tu voulais pas de moi, pas vrai ?
Non, pas vraiment.
Où est ce tank ?
On ne va pas faire long feu
contre ces camions.
On doit tenir bon.
Putain !
Continuez à les occuper, OK ?
D'accord.
Donne-moi un autre chargeur.
Tu vas où ?
On n'a pas d'angle de tir ici.
Je vais sur la colline,
pour neutraliser le tireur.
- Je te couvre.
- OK.
On le couvre !
Pourquoi éliminer les témoins ?
Quels que soient ceux qui te traquent,
ils voudront...
utiliser la bombe à des
fins personnelles ou...
t'empêcher de l'utiliser,
mais...
dans tous les cas,
pourquoi pas de témoins ?
Les bombes sont marquées, non ?
Quelque chose...
les rend traçables.
Je me souviens d'avoir lu ça.
C'est l'uranium.
Il a...
Il a une signature spécifique, qui..
indique l'endroit
où l'engin a été fabriqué.
Il y a eu une douzaine de ces trucs
utilisée dans les attaques, c'est ça ?
- Et à présent tu as la dernière.
- Ouais.
Je ne pense pas que ces gens
en ont après l'arme...
C'est plus que ça.
C'est...
...une preuve.
C'est la preuve tangible
du plus grand crime
dans l'histoire du monde.
La bombe...
elle peut trahir les gens qui sont
responsables de ces attaques.
C'est pour ça qu'ils veulent
la reprendre.
T'as vu ça ?
La vache !
C'était...
<i>La vache !
Ça va nous faire
gagner un peu de temps.
Mais ils reviendront,
encore plus nombreux.
Ce sera moins facile
la prochaine fois.
Facile?
T'as trouvé ça facile?
Papa ?
Ça ne va pas ?
Débarrassez la table !
Je vais chercher Kenchy.
- Trouve ma mère !
- ll faut des serviettes.
Des antiseptiques,
et de l'alcool.
- On a besoin d'alcool.
- Une serviette !
Trouvez-moi de l'alcool !
C'est parti.
Donne-moi ça. Allez.
OK, c'est bon.
Continue d'appuyer.
- Quoi ?
- Continue ! Continue d'appuyer.
<i>Jake, à toi.
Vous avez fait du bon boulot.
<i>Dis à ton père qu'ils reviennent.
Il s'est fait tiré dessus.
Je suis désolé.
Tu sais quoi faire, hein ?
<i>Appuie sur la blessure,
<i>et il doit y avoir de la morphine
dans les affaires que je t'ai données.
Ouais, on l'a.
Écoute, Jake.
Les gens vont se tourner
vers toi désormais.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Bon, les mecs vont revenir.
Ils se sont réfugiés
à la ferme des Talbot.
Je pense qu'ils attendent des renforts,
donc vous avez un peu de temps
pour vous regrouper.
<i>Garde la radio près de toi,
et je te tiendrais au courant.
Terminé.
Terminé.
S'il vous plait,
je dois parler à un responsable.
Là-bas.
Excusez-moi, monsieur ?
Colonel Hoffman.
Ne m'appelez Monsieur,
que si vous avez prévu de vous engager.
Il y a une usine à munitions
dans une ville qui s'appelle New Bern.
Ils ont prévu d'envahir la ville
de Jericho. Des gens vont mourir.
Ils ont essayé de me tuer,
mais j'ai pu m'enfuir.
- Vous devez aider ces personnes.
- Où est-ce ?
Kansas, pas loin de
la frontière du Colorado.
J'aimerais vous aider, mais je dois
sécuriser les routes dans le coin.
- Mais...
- Je ne peux en décider.
Je ne suis qu'un employé
du gouvernement.
Quel gouvernement ?
États-Unis.
Tout va bien, madame ?
On nous avait dit que 6 personnes
revendiquaient la présidence.
Il y avait. En réalité, il ne reste
que quelques résistants...
Texas, un front à l'Est.
Le nouveau gouvernement fédéral
a été rétabli à Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Colonel, ceci est une urgence.
Vous devez y aller.
La bataille a peut-être déjà commencé.
Je suis vraiment désolé, madame.
Casper, assurez-vous qu'elle
retourne au centre médical.
Venez, madame.
Faites-les sortir.
Faites-les sortir.
Sortez, tout le monde.
Écoutez...
Cet endroit...
est votre salut.
Défendez-le, entendu ?
On le fera.
Je suis désolé de vous infliger ça.
Vous avez traversé assez d'épreuves.
Papa...
Papa, arrête.
Tu es plus fort que tu ne le penses.
Tu l'as toujours été.
Je t'aime, fiston.
Je crois que j'ai zigué quand
j'aurais dû zaguer dehors, non ?
J'aimerais que votre mère soit là.
Elle arrive.
Elle sera là.
Dites à votre mère que je l'aime.
J'ai été... dur avec toi.
Je t'ai forcé... à t'éloigner.
Je suis heureux que tu...sois...
revenu à la maison.
Je suis fier de toi.
Le grand moment.
Avant de commencer,
y a-t-il quelqu'un...
qui ne m'a pas écrit
de discours ?
Je suis surpris de voir à quel point
vous me trouvez dérangé,
et qu'on me fasse si peu confiance
pour dire quelques mots...
à propos de mon frère.
Le truc c'est que...
tout ça est assez nul.
Aucun n'a mentionné la période
théâtre musical de mon frère,
quand nous pensions tous
qu'il était gay.
Sérieusement.
Vous avez échappé au pire,
tant que vous ne l'avez pas entendu
chanter "One Hand, One Heart"
sous la douche tous les matins.
Je taquine pas mal mon frère,
mais...
la vérité c'est...
la vérité c'est que
je suis très fier de lui.
Je suis...
Je suis fier de sa gentillesse.
Je suis fier de sa générosité.
Et...
c'est un homme très chanceux.
Vraiment.
Mon père est mort.
Le combat continue.
Ramenez Gray en ville.
Quoi ?
Attends une minute...
Viens demain, ceux qui restent
auront besoin d'un leader.
Je pense qu'on a eu assez de perte
pour aujourd'hui.
On a besoin de tous
les bras disponibles.
- Je ne vais nulle part.
- Tu es trop important, Gray.
- Ce n'est pas négociable.
- Donnez-lui une escorte.
Et que tout le monde
rejoigne son poste.
On ne sait pas quand
ils reviendront.
Vas-y.
<i>Leurs renforts sont là.
200 hommes.
<i>Et près d'un millier en plus.
<i>Ils se préparent en ce moment,
je dirai que vous avez 15...
<i>peut-être 20 minutes
avant qu'ils soient sur vous.
Reviens ici le plus vite possible, OK ?
Tu as des infos sur le chemin de fer,
celui qui longe la rivière ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu vois quoi ?
<i>Il y a quoi sur les voies ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne vois plus rien.
- Attends...
- Robert, déconnecte-le.
Il y a un train venant de New Bern,
<i>avec 3 wagons de marchandises.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils transportent ?
Des hommes je pense...
des centaines.
Ce sont encore d'autres renforts !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Parle-moi !
Je te rejoins.
Je dois y aller.
Attends.
Ils n'ont eu que
quelques secondes,
ce n'est pas assez pour
une localisation précise.
- On est en sécurité pour un moment.
- Où vas-tu ?
Je dois stopper un train.
I-80 est sécurisé de Cheyenne
à Grand Island.
On contrôle maintenant la zone entre
Kearney et Hastings.
La situation sur l'I-70
va devenir délicate.
Il y a des gangs organisés qui
contrôlent la plupart des échangeurs.
J'ai aussi été prévenu par
une patiente du centre médical,
que l'on pouvait s'attendre à un
conflit entre deux villes...
au nord-ouest du Kansas.
New Bern et Jericho.
Quel est l'emplacement de ces villes ?
CZ-12, quadrant 4.
Nous avons repéré un suspect terroriste
dans les 320 Km de cette zone.
La capture de ce suspect
est de haute priorité
pour l'administration
du Président Tomarchio.
Vous me comprenez ?
Dois-je changer nos priorités,
monsieur ?
Immédiatement.
Allez à Jericho,
et étouffez ce conflit.
Une fois la zone dégagée,
Nous commencerons
les recherches sur ce terroriste.
Je vais demander à Mimi de m'épouser.
Sérieux ?
Ouais.
Elle sait pas cuisiner,
elle a jamais rien compris
au base-ball,
elle déteste mes vêtements...
mais je l'aime.
Et je suis heureux.
Jake, je veux pas
mourir aujourd'hui.
Tu vas t'en sortir.
Je te le promets.
Constantino se rapproche
avec ses camions.
- On a peu de temps.
- Et pour le train ?
À peu près 20 minutes.
Dis-moi que tu as un plan,
un vraiment bon.
J'aurai besoin de votre tank.
Il ne pourra rien tirer,
tu le sais, hein ?
Il n'y a pas de munitions dedans.
J'ai pas prévu de tirer
quoi que ce soit.
L'accélérateur est sur ta gauche,
et pour le diriger, t'as seulement à...
C'est pas la première fois.
Bonne chance.
Toi aussi.
C'est imminent, non ?
Je suis, euh...
Tu sais qu'il est là.
Il nous observe.
Tu le sais ça, pas vrai ?
Ils sautent encore comme des lapins
là-dedans ?
Je crois que c'est la Macarena.
La quoi ?
Ouais, ils sautent toujours
comme des lapins.
C'est un bon discours que t'as fait.
Je ne pensais pas que tu étais un de
ces idiots qui fait dans le sentimental.
- Maman l'a écrit.
- Tu crois ?
Écoute, je sais qu'Eric et toi
n'êtes pas si proches et...
peut-être que tu ne te sentais pas
d'être debout devant une foule et...
d'agir comme tu l'as fait.
Parfois, agir comme tu le ressens
et agir comme il se devrait
sont 2 choses différentes.
Tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter pour
moi, papa. Je vais bien.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi, je sens que
mon inquiétude est loin d'être terminée.
Mais elle le sera un jour.
Je sais qu'un jour tu deviendras
l'homme que j'ai toujours vu en toi,
l'homme que tu es censé être.
Mon Dieu, ce sera un jour mémorable.
Viens, Johnston.
Ce scotch ne va pas se boire tout seul.
Le vieux et moi allons vers le lac,
partager un whisky vieux de 30 ans.
Tu veux venir ?
Ouais. Je vais juste...
attendre Emily, lui dire bonne nuit.
Je te rejoins là-bas.
Je te garderai une place.
- Où va-t-il ?
- Il attend Emily pour dire bonne nuit.
C'est la dernière fois
qu'on le verra ce soir.
Si j'avais une copine
qui lui ressemblait,
je ne la ferais pas attendre.
T'entends ça, fiston ?
Je vais éloigner cette fille de toi.
Ouais, bien dit.
Tu devrais faire plus attention
à toi aussi.
Ta femme est folle de moi.
Elle serait capable
d'aller te voir 3 fois par jour.
C'est Constantino.
J'écoute.
<i>Mes éclaireurs viennent de m'informer.
<i>Je suis désolé pour ton père.
Jake, vous êtes à court de
munitions et d'hommes.
On est trop nombreux et trop
désespérés pour abandonner.
<i>Vous ne pouvez pas gagner.
<i>Je vous laisse une dernière chance.
<i>Partez,
déposez vos armes,
Partez,
déposez vos armes,
et rentrez chez vous,
et personne d'autre ne sera blessé.
Jake, j'ai besoin d'une réponse.
Quelle est ta décision ?
Des clous.
Désolé, j'ai pas bien compris.
Tu peux aller droit en enfer.
Et pour mon père...
c'est toi que je viendrai trouver.
Je veux rentrer chez moi.
Nous devons éloigner les gens
des zones de combat.
Vous serez plus en sécurité à Cheyenne.
Colonel Hoffman ?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Monsieur, départ dans 5 minutes.
- Reçu.
- Jericho est devenue notre priorité.
- Merci.
Dieu merci.
C'est grâce à vous.
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
Nous allons rétablir la situation.
En route.
Mon père voulait
que l'on prenne position ici.
Pour défendre nos maisons.
C'est ce que nous allons faire.
Fumigène !
Tous en position !
Ne gâchez pas vos balles !
Attendez le bon moment pour tirer !
Attendez...
Attendez...
Attendez...

<i>Previously on </i>Jericho
Oh, my God... Ted !
We grew up together over in New Bern.
- You just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.
Johnston, you SOB.
How the hell did you lose an election?
No. The question is, how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?
They get tired of you being sheriff?
<i>Can we buy some more of these things?
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...
ten percent of your spring crop.
Okay, we'll give you the food.
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They slid it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.
Where's Heather?
She's dead, Jake.
Everybody go!
<i>Jericho is about to be invaded.
<i>We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.
Most of you have no idea of
what's coming.
This isn't a fight about land.
This is a fight for our very existence.
I know this has great artistic merit,
but...
i'm taking these shoes off
in ten minutes.
So, if you don't want
to have to hide my toes...
Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable.
We can't really do this
without the best man anyway.
Where is Jake?
I don't see him.
Grandpa seems to be missing, too.
Take a wild guess where they are.
Right.
Oh, Beth.
It's so nice to see you, dear.
I need your help.
We need to go over
to the medical center.
- Is everyone in there?
- Yeah. We're just waiting for you.
How is it going out there?
They took Talbot's farm.
How many men?
I'd say 60... 70.
That's probably just
an advance team.
I would imagine they got more than that
up the road in reserve.
Constantino has us outnumbered
and outgunned.
If we split our force, and try
to defend each one of these farms,
he's goino toverwhelm us.
So what are you saying?
I'm saying we don't split up.
We choose a place to stand together,
deliver a good, hard counterpunch.
Let them know that,
if they intend to take from us,
it's going to cost them dearly.
How?
Well, right here.
Stanley Richmond's farm.
It's the last place
before this road divides,
and they start taking ground
faster than we can keep up.
Plus which it's the highest point
in the whole area.
There's where we make our stand.
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.
He told the farm is secured.
Let's go get the rest of them.
Let's go!
This one's alive.

<i>6 YEARS AGO
- Grandpa, you're drunk.
- Yeah!
Thank you, darling
Keep 'em coming.
Gail's going to get so mad at you
for getting her boy drunk.
I've got Gail wrapped
around my little finger.
Says the guy who taught me
to fly his crop duster when I was 13,
then told Mom I was lying
when I mentioned it.
I was so jealous.
My mom knew that you let him fly,
and she wouldn't let me go
anywhere near you.
You see, Jake would...
Jake would come over and tell me
all the stories you told him.
I loved...
I loved the one about the peanuts.
What the hell are you talking about?
The peanuts in World War II.
He means the "Nuts" story, Grandpa.
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.
So what's the story?
Tell me the story, somebody.
What? It's his story.
All right.
World War II.
The winter of 1944.
The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines,
and surrounded...
a division of Americans
in a little town called Bastogne,
freezing, starving and running out
of ammunition, but they knew...
that they had to hold that ground.
Just before Christmas,
the Nazis sent a note
to the American commander
telling him that he could
surrender and save the rt of his men,
or they could stay and fight.
The American commander
sent a one-word reply
to the Wehrmacht commander,
and it said...
- ... "Nuts."
Why did he say, "Nuts"?
It means, "Go to hell!"
Why didn't he just say, "Go to hell"?
Because he said, "Nuts. "
Gail, my sweetheart,
you look beautiful.
Save it, Dal.
Was it your idea
to get my son drunk tonight?
Right. Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.
- Come on.
- But I'm hammered.
And I want to talk to you.
Have a cup of coffee, Stanley.
Here.
Well, what's this?
As your brother's best man,
you are required to give a toast,
so I wrote down a few thoughts,
some things that
you might want to say.
You think I was going to wing it?
Let's go take some pictures, okay?
What's going on?
Mr. Green, I have access
to a keyhole military satellite
that I can use to track New Bern's
movements in the field today.
- Beg pardon?
- It's real.
The one restriction...
is that no one can know
where you're getting this information.
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field,
tell them what you want...
but the satellite must remain a secret.
Sounds good.
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?
I get it. Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.
- But...
- I am about to go to war,
with New Bern, Kansas,
the home of the nearest Costco.
Today is already just about
as weird as I can handle.
I'm not asking any more questions.
Mom, Dad,
there's a chance we may have
to leave here today,
and we might not be able
to make it back, so...
I just wanted to...
We just...
wanted to pay our respects.
Remember I told you about that witch,
from the IRS?
The one that wanted
to take everything
you've ever worked for?
Mom, Dad...
this is Mimi.
Hello.
It's nice to finally meet you.
I really love your son.
And, of course,
Bonnie is...
she's just wonderful.
And I've really enjoyed
living with them and...
- Oh, great.
- What?
I didn't say we were living together.
We're not married.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly... I...
Is everything a joke to you?
I figure one day we're going
to be buried here ourselves,
and I...
think it would be nice if...
our kids came and,
and joked around with us.
I hope that's not
for a really long time.
How we doing?
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.
We got more coming, right?
They're trickling in. It's taking
a lot longer than we thought.
Saying good-bye to their families.
Get on down to the pass.
Get everybody organized.
We don't have a whole lot of time
before their advance unit hits.
- Not you.
- Why not?
Because these people
elected you their leader.
We protect you at all costs.
And, besides, in a few minutes,
I'm going to need your help.
Help with what?
Arming our tank.
Our daughter is out there carrying
a rifle and... I'm in here.
Sam needs you here.
You know, Allie's safe.
She's been assigned to Town Hall,
and the fighting is miles from there.
Right now, there really isn't
anything else you can be doing.
Here we go.
<i>Jake, you are about
to have company.
Already?
<i>New Bern is on its way.
There are...
<i>70, maybe... 80 men.
Is that tank there yet?
They're trying to load it
with that mortar round right now.
I think you're gonna need it.
All right, let's get ready!
They're coming!
Get some ammo down here!
What is it?
I'm being tracked.
Tracked?
What do you mean?
Someone is trying to trace my location
through the satellite.
- Well, can they?
- If they have time, yes.
Do you know who it is?
My guess is, it's... Valente.
What him?
From... Homeland Security?
I don't know who he's working for now,
but he told Sarah
to get the bomb any way she could
and to eliminate all witnesses.
All the witnesses.
- Shut it down.
- No, I can't.
We just have to make sure we disconnect
the feed before he finishes the trace.
I don't get it.
- Why are they just standing there?
- I don't know.
Do we fire the first shot?
New Bern's here.
Get into position.
We're gonna need that tank.
Having a good time?
By the way, I think I saw April
making out with Shep Cale.
All right, all right.
You need to stop drinking.
Listen.
Read this.
It's a speech.
Figure you should have something ready,
so you don't embarrass yourself.
You mean so I don't embarrass you,
because you don't have to worry.
Is that how you spell
"venereal disease"?
This day is important to me, okay?
Just because your life's a big joke
doesn't mean you have
to treat mine that way.
Why is my life a joke?
- Just read the speech.
- No, seriously, Eric,
why is my life a joke?
- I'm not getting into this right now.
All right.
You think people don't wonder
what you've been doing?
You spend all that time
in flight school getting your license.
Instead of using it,
you come back here,
hanging out like it's the summer
after high school.
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.
If I'm such a joke,
then why'd you want me as your best man?
You didn't want me, did you?
No, not really.
Where's that tank?
We're not going to last long
against those trucks.
We have to hold out.
Damn it!
- Got to keep drawing their fire,
all right?  - Got It.
Give me another mag.
Where are you going?
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill...
and shot on the gunner.
- I got your back.
- All right.
Cover him!
Why eliminate witnesses?
I mean, whoever's tracking you,
they either...
want to use the bomb
for themselves or...
they want to keep you
from using it, but...
either way,
what difference do witnesses make?
The bombs have fingerprints,
don't they? Something that...
make them traceable.
I remember reading that.
It's the uranium.
It has...
It has a specific signature.
It places the origin of the device
where it was made.
So there were dozens of these things
used in the attacks, right?
And now you have the last one.
I don't think these people are looking
at this thing as a weapon.
It's more than that.
It's...
Evidence.
It's the smoking gun
behind the greatest crime
in the history of the world.
The bomb...
it could expose the people...
who were responsible for the attacks.
That's why they need it back.
Did u see what I just did?
Holy crap.
That was...
<i>Holy crap!
All right, that bought us some time.
But they'll be back,
and there'll be more of them.
And it won't be near as easy
next time.
Easy?
You thought that was easy?
Dad?
What's wrong?
Clear the table!
Clear it!
- Clear it!
- I'm gonna go get Kenchy.
- Get my mom!
- We'll need towels.
And some antiseptic,
and some alcohol.
- We need alcohol.
- Get a towel!
Get me some alcohol!
Here we go.
Give me that, come on!
Okay, all right.
Keep the pressure on.
What?
Keep it on! Keep the pressure.
<i>Jake, come in.
Nice work out there.
<i>Tell your father that
they're coming back around.
He's been shot.
I'm sorry.
You know what to do, right?
<i>Keep pressure on the wound,
<i>and there should be some morphine
syrettes in the... supplies I gave you.
Yeah, we've got it.
Listen, Jake.
<i>People are gonna be
looking to you now.
<i>You know what I mean?
Okay, the guys will be back.
They retreated to Talbot's farm.
<i>My guess is,
they're waiting for reinforcements,
<i>so you should have a little time
to regroup out there.
<i>Just keep the radio close,
and I'll update you.
Out.
Out.
Please, I need to talk
whoever's in charge.
Right over there.
Excuse me, sir?
Colonel Hoffman.
You don't have to call me sir,
unless you plan to enlist.
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.
It's planning to overrun the town
of Jericho. People are gonna get killed.
They tried to kill me,
but I got away.
- You've got to help these people.
- Where is this?
Kansas, not far from
the Colorado border.
I wish I could help. My orders are
to secure the roads in this area.
- But, sir...
- I don't get to make these decisions.
I'm just a government employee.
Which government?
United States.
Are you all right, ma'am?
We heard there were six different people
claiming the presidency.
There were. In fact, there are still
a couple of holdouts...
Texas, a bloc in the East.
The new federal government's
been restored in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Colonel, this is an emergency.
You have to go to Jericho. The fighting
could be happening right now.
I am very sorry, ma'am.
Casper, you see she gets back
to the medical unit.
Come on, ma'am.
Get 'em out.
Get 'em out.
Clear everyone out.
You listen...
This place,
is where you survive.
You make a stand here,
you hear?
We will.
I'm sorry you have to see this.
You've been through enough.
Dad...
Dad, stop.
You're stronger than you think
you are, though.
Always have been.
I love you, son.
I guess I zigged when I should've
zagged out there, huh?
I sure wish your mother was here.
She's coming.
She'll be here.
Tell your mother I love her.
I was... hard on you.
I pushed you... away.
I'm glad you... came... home.
I'm proud of you.
The big toast.
Before I start,
is there anyone who...
hasn't written me a speech?
It really makes me wonder
how screwed up you think I am
that I can't be trusted
to say a few things...
about my brother.
The thing is...
these are all pretty lame.
Not one of them mentions
my brother's musical theater phase
when we all thought he was gay.
Seriously.
You have not heard disturbing
until you've heard him singing
"One Hand, One Heart"
in the shower every morning.
I tease my brother a lot,
but...
the truth is...
the truth is I'm very proud of him.
I'm...
I'm proud of how kind he is...
I'm proud of how giving he is,
and...
he's a very lucky man.
Really.
My father's dead.
We'll get through.
Get Gray back to town.
What?
Wait a minute...
Come tomorrow,
what's left of us will need a leader.
I think we've lost enough
in that department for one day.
We're gonna need
every set of hands we can get.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're too important now, Gray.
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.
And start getting everyone
into position.
Who knows when
they're gonna come back again?
Go ahead.
<i>So they got their reinforcements.
<i>It's a couple hundred men.
<i>And another six of those
deuce and a halfs.
<i>They're mobilizing now,
so I say you got about 15,
<i>maybe 20 minutes
before they're on you.
You get back here as soon as you can.
All right?
Say, what do you know about
a set of train tracks
running alongside the river?
Why?
What do you see?
<i>Hawkins, what's on the tracks?
I don't know. I can't see.
- Hang on.
- Robert, disconnect it.
Jake, you got a very large train
coming from New Bern,
<i>and they've got three cargo cars.
<i>What's in them?
I think it's men,
and there's hundreds of them.
It's a whole set of reinforcement...
Hawkins, what's going on?
Talk to me.
<i>I'm on my way.
I've got to go.
Wait.
Look, they only had a few seconds.
It wasn't enough time
to get an exact location.
- We're fine for a little while.
- Where are you going?
I have to stop a train.
I-80 is secured
from Cheyenne to Grand Island.
We now control the area
between Kearney and Hastings.
I-70 is turning out to be a challenge.
There are organized road gangs
controlling much of the interstate.
I've also been told by a patient
in our medical unit
to expect a significant skirmish
between two towns
in northwest Kansas:
New Bern and Jericho.
<i>What is the location of those towns?
CZ-12, Quadrant Four.
<i>We've tracked the terror suspect
to within 200 miles of that area.
<i>Capture of this suspect
is a top priority
<i>for President Tomarchio
and the administration.
<i>Do you understand?
- Should I re-prioritize, sir?
- <i>Immediately.
Go to Jericho and crush the skirmish.
Once the area's clear,
we will begin our search
for the terrorist.
I'm gonna ask Mimi to marry me.
Yeah?
Yeah. She can't cook,
she's never seen nine innings
of baseball in her life,
she hates my clothes...
but I love her.
And I'm happy.
Jake, I don't want to die today.
You're gonna make it out of here.
That I promise.
Constantino and those trucks
are right on your doorstep.
You don't have much time.
What about that train?
20 minutes, give or take.
Tell me you have a plan,
a really good one.
I need to borrow your tank.
It won't fire.
I told you that, right?
There's not a single
round of ammo in it.
I'm not planning on shooting anything.
The throttle's there on your left.
And to steer, you're just gonna...
Hey. This is not my first time.
Good luck out there.
You, too.
Any minute now, huh?
I'm...
You know, he's here...
watching.
You know that, right?
They still doing
the bunny hop in there?
I think it's the Macarena.
The what?
Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop.
Quite a speech you made in there.
I had no idea you were
such a sentimental fool.
Mom wrote it.
You think?
Listen, I know that you and Eric
aren't close and...
maybe you didn't feel like standing up
in front of a bunch of people and...
acting like you were.
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing
and doing what needs to be done
are two different things.
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.
I'm fine.
I somehow get the feeling
my worrying days are far from over.
But they will be one day.
One day, I know you're gonna become
the man I know you can be,
the man you were born to be.
My God, that day's gonna be
something to see.
Come on, Johnston.
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.
Me and the old man are gonna
head down to the lake
and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?
Yeah. I'm just gonna...
wait for Emily, say good night.
I'll...
meet you there.
I'll save you a place.
- Where's he going?
- Waiting for Emily, say good night.
That's the last we'll see
of him tonight.
Dad...
If I had a girl that looked like that,
I wouldn't keep her waiting.
You hear that, boy?
I'm gonna take that girl
away from you.
You talk a good game.
You better watch out
for yourself, too.
Your wife is crazy about me.
Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory
switch to you three times a day.
It's Constantino.
I'm here.
<i>My scouts just informed me.
<i>I am sorry about your father.
You're outmanned,
and you're outgunned.
There's too many of us and
we are too desperate to give up.
You cannot win this.
I'm giving you one last chance.
<i>Walk away,
put your guns down...
Walk away,
put your guns down...
and return to town,
and no one else will be harmed.
Jake, I need an answer.
What's it gonna be?
Nuts.
Sorry, I didn't get that.
You can go straight to hell.
About my father...
you're the one I'm coming for.
I want to go home.
Our orders are to take people
out of the conflict zone.
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.
Colonel Hoffman?
What is all this?
- Sir, wheels up in five minutes.
- Roger that.
- Jericho's been moved up to priority #1
on the list.  - Thank you.
Oh, God, thank you.
This is all thanks to you.
Don't worry. We're gonna get things
back to normal again.
All right, saddle up.
My father expected us
to make a stand here.
To defend our home.
That's what we're gonna do.
Smoke bombs!
Get in position!
Don't waste your rounds!
Wait for a clean shot!
Wait...
Wait...
Wait...
Now!

<i>Jericho,</i>
<i>une petite ville du Kansas qui a été
témoin de 2 séries d'attaques nucléaires</i>
<i>qui ont détruit 23 villes américaines</i>
<i>en un seul jour.</i>
<i>Les attaques ont paralysé</i>
<i>et fracturé le gouvernement américain,</i>
<i>laissant notre ville coupée du monde.</i>
Par pitié, aidez-nous.
Si ce pays est en guerre,
on doit le savoir !
<i>Même dans les pires moments,
on peut trouver le meilleur...</i>
<i>en nous... et dans les autres.</i>
<i>Robert Hawkins...</i>
<i>Un agent sous couverture
censé arrêter les attaques,</i>
<i>est maintenant poursuivi
par ses anciens chefs</i>
<i>pour le secret qu'il détient :</i>
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
<i>... une bombe nucléaire.</i>
Des douzaines de ces choses
ont servi pour l'attaque, non ?
Et là, tu as la dernière...
... Preuve.
Un indice flagrant du plus grand crime
de l'histoire de l'humanité.
<i>Puis, alors qu'on est sur le point
d'être envahis par une ville voisine,</i>
<i>un nouveau gouvernement apparaît,</i>
<i>basé à Cheyenne, Wyoming,</i>
<i>un gouvernement avec un nouveau visage,
dressant un nouveau drapeau.</i>
Maintenant !
Retenez-les !
Assis !
Je suis le Major Beck,
division Theft Mountain.
Le Colonel Hoffman m'a demandé de faire
la lumière sur les événements passés,
et de l'en informer.
Apparemment, vous êtes les leaders
des 2 camps.
Il y a quelques heures,
vous vous êtes livrés
à une guerre sanglante de territoire :
136 Américains morts,
le double de blessés,
plus de 70000 balles tirées...
Vous avez quelque chose à dire ?
On avait besoin de nourriture,
d'eau et de provisions,
Jericho avait tout ça.
On a essayé de négocier en paix,
Jericho a répondu avec hostilité,
allant jusqu'au meurtre de sang froid
de 8 de mes adjoints.
Affamés,
faisant face à d'hostiles voisins,
on a dû passer à l'action.
Votre version ?
Ma version ?
Il nous a maintenus en otage,
il a torturé mon frère,
il nous a terrorisés avec des mortiers.
La paix...
Il ne voulait pas la paix,
il voulait tout nous voler.
Ils nous ont attaqués !
Ça nous a coûté...
je ne sais combien
d'hommes et de femmes,
ça m'a coûté mon père.
D'accord.
Le conflit entre ces 2 villes
est officiellement terminé.
- Ce n'est pas fini.
- Oh que si !
Au cas où vous n'auriez pas
compris le message,
j'ai l'intention de m'en assurer.
Je vais superviser cette zone
et mener une enquête approfondie
sur les événements d'aujourd'hui.
Ça ne suffit pas !
Suivez-moi.
Vous n'imaginez pas ce qu'on a perdu.
Pas pour l'instant.
On m'a demandé de gérer cette zone
pour une bonne raison :
je suis bon dans ce que je fais.
Rentrez chez vous,
rejoignez vos proches,
soignez les blessés
et pleurez vos morts.
Ensuite,
aidez-nous à reconstruire cet endroit.
Le cauchemar est fini.
L'ordre sera rétabli.

<i>6 mois sont passés</i>
<i>depuis le jour qui a changé
le cours de l'histoire.</i>
<i>Plus de 15 millions de personnes
sont mortes ou mourantes</i>
<i>et 40 autres milliards sans abri.</i>
<i>Et les éléments restants
du gouvernement fédéral</i>
<i>ont été éparpillés dans le vent.</i>
<i>Assez vite, les preuves
commencèrent à s'accumuler</i>
<i>que les fonds et les bombes
ayant servi aux attaques,</i>
<i>avaient été fournis par des éléments</i>
<i>appartenant aux gouvernements
Iranien et nord Coréen.</i>
<i>Mais ce qu'il restait
de l'ancien gouvernement</i>
<i>était paralysé par l'indécision,</i>
<i>et la communauté internationale
refusait d'agir.</i>
<i>C'est ainsi que commença
l'ascension d'un héros national.</i>
<i>Le jeune sénateur du Wyoming,</i>
<i>John Tomarchio</i>
<i>a rallié le pays...</i>
Tu fous quoi, mec ?
Désolé.
Ça fait une semaine
que tu regardes le même truc,
c'est toujours la même histoire,
encore et encore.
Tu crois louper quoi ?
J'attends qu'ils expliquent
ce qu'il s'est passé avec le drapeau.
Ça a déjà été expliqué
environ 400 fois.
Ils tentent de rassembler le pays
mais tous les États ne suivent pas,
seulement ceux à l'ouest du Mississippi.
<i>Le 3e jour...</i>
<i>de sa tournée rapide
des États alliés de l'ouest...</i>
Aujourd'hui, c'était le jour
de l'opération de Pete, je...
suis venu voir comment ça s'est passé.
Et ?
Je suis surpris qu'il ait tenu si
longtemps avec les éclats qu'il a pris.
Alors...
On en est à combien ?
- Soixante-quatre...
- Cinq... Soixante-cinq.
Je dois dire...
je ne sais pas quel genre de punition
ce Major Beck a prévu pour New Bern,
mais j'aimerais être là
quand ça se fera.
- Salut.
- Salut toi.
Tu bosses avec <i>Jennings and Rall</i> ?
Ouais, ils m'aident à organiser
le programme éducatif pour le lycée.
Quoi ?
Rien,
ça fait un peu bizarre de les avoir ici.
L'armée ne peut pas tout faire.
<i>J and R</i> nous offre
du soutien au jour le jour,
comme donner le matériel et...
- redonner du travail aux gens.
- Je vois ce qu'ils font.
C'est-à-dire ?
Tu sais ce que ça me fait
de ne rien avoir à faire...
- Tu crois qu'il est de New Bern ?
- Ouais.
Ouais.
Merde !
Tu m'as fait une de ces peurs, Robert.
Tu m'as manqué aussi.
Depuis combien de temps es-tu là ?
Une minute ou deux.
Je viens juste de rentrer.
Je t'ai dit que je devais déplacer
le signal satellite vers la route,
pour voir qui nous poursuit.
C'était il y a 4 jours.
Je sais, mais...
quelques heures après l'avoir connecté,
il a commencé à y avoir une grosse
activité militaire dans la zone.
Et je voulais savoir où ils allaient.
Deux jours après,
ils ont installé un camp de base.
Qui ? Le nouveau gouvernement ?
- Mais pourquoi te chercheraient-ils ?
- Je pense...
que Valente
travaille avec eux maintenant.
Tu sais, Robert,
cette ville grouille de soldats.
Est-on en sécurité ici ?
Si Valente est aux commandes,
alors, ce n'est pas après moi.
Rappelle-toi, il croit
que toi, moi et les enfants
avons tous été tués il y a des mois.
Il doit chercher la personne
qui nous a tués.
Il cherche Sarah.
Tu en es sûr ?
Oui,
je suis sûr.
Tu sais, le...
chef m'a demandé
de rester dans leurs bureaux
- pour faire le travail administratif.
- Non.
Je pourrais essayer
de découvrir ce qu'ils savent,
et écoute, il te faudra des yeux
et des oreilles à l'intérieur du camp.
Merci...
mais non.
- Robert...
- Darcy !
Que s'est-il passé ici ?
Allons, vous le savez très bien.
Un autre enculé de New Bern en vendetta.
C'est le douzième en deux semaines.
On en a stoppé autant
dans l'autre sens.
- Il parle ?
- Non, monsieur.
- Poursuivez-le
- Oui, monsieur.
Heather ?
Oh, mon Dieu...
<i>"Ne t'en fais pas, Jake,
ce n'est que pour quelques jours."</i>
Comment vas-tu ? Tu vas bien ?
Ouais, je vais bien...
Oui, le Major Beck a eu la gentillesse
de me ramener avec son convoi, alors...
Ça va ?
Ça va.
Ça va.
On planifiera une récolte pour bientôt.
- Et ça comprendra toute ma dette ?
- Oui.
- Tout sera effacé...
- C'est génial.
Votre femme ?
Pas encore.
Je voulais m'assurer
de solder mes dettes avant, mais...
Ce sont ces jours-là
que j'aime mon boulot.
Mimi, voici Trish Merick,
elle bosse pour <i>Jennings and Rall</i>.
- Salut.
- Vous avez un homme super, Mimi.
Oh, mon Dieu, oui...
- On en reparle plus tard.
- Merci, merci beaucoup.
Tu as vu sa peau ?
On dirait de la porcelaine,
cette fille n'a jamais passé
une nuit blanche de toute sa vie...
et moi, je dois courir 8 kms par jour
pour que mon cul
ne touche pas mes chevilles.
Je possède à nouveau ma ferme.
- Quoi ?
- Je la possède à nouveau,
<i>J and R</i> m'ont aidé à passer
un marché avec le gouvernement
pour éponger ma dette.
Je leur donne une partie de mes cultures
pendant 3 ans et dès maintenant...
je récupère
l'entière propriété de ma ferme.
- Tu y crois ?
- C'est merveilleux.
Ouais.
- Stanley, c'est si merveilleux.
- Ouais...
Épouse-moi.
- Attends, quoi ?
- Épouse-moi.
Je t'aime.
La guerre est finie, on voit à nouveau
la lumière, la vie est belle...
Marions-nous !
Qu'en penses-tu ?
C'est juste que...
C'est mon pire cauchemar.
- Non, écoute !
- Je n'ai rien dit,
- oublie tout ça, OK ?
- Écoute-moi...
- Je ne suis qu'une pauvre idiote.
- Arrête !
Bien sur que je t'épouserai, je t'aime,
je voulais juste...
Tu ne comprends pas, c'est juste que...
Tu sais quoi ? Oublie ça !
Peu importe.
Oui, oui, je veux t'épouser.
Je ne veux pas de ta pitié.
Attends, je...
Marions-nous, d'accord ?
Marions-nous...
D'accord ?
- D'accord.
- D'accord, bien.
Tu pourrais peut-être m'embrasser.
T'es pas croyable !
Viens par là.
Messieurs, votre attention...
J'ai des nouvelles pour vous.
À l'heure d'aujourd'hui,
nous avons rétabli le courant
sur 70 % de la ville.
Nous prévoyons d'avoir terminé
pour la fin du mois.
Pour tout dire, la reconstruction
de Jericho sera vite terminée.
Bonne nouvelle.
Après ce qu'on a traversé, c'est...
Attends un peu...
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Il n'a pas encore dit
la mauvaise nouvelle.
Non, c'est vrai.
New Bern... L'enquête...
J'ai déterminé...
que New Bern était certainement
responsable de votre conflit.
Mais ?
Dans un souci de réconciliation...
Vous plaisantez ? Réconciliation ?
Il est dans l'intérêt commun d'oublier
toutes les actions criminelles
commises après les attaques.
Constantino ne va pas s'en tirer ainsi.
Il a été déchargé de ses fonctions.
On ne laissera pas faire,
on ne restera pas là...
Laisse-le expliquer.
- Je ne veux pas d'explication !
- Eh bien, moi, si !
Ce gars est venu
nous protéger d'un monde qui
ne nous fait pas de cadeaux
depuis 6 mois.
Constantino est responsable de la mort
de plus de 60 hommes et femmes
de cette ville,
y compris mon père !
Il n'y aura aucune réconciliation
tant qu'il ne sera pas mort !
Je veux que vous écoutiez vraiment bien
ce que je vais dire...
Il n'y aura aucune rébellion
tant que je serai là,
il n'y aura
aucune vengeance meurtrière !
La porte !
Il y a quatre ans,
j'étais chargé de ramener l'ordre
dans une zone tendue,
du côté de Kandahar.
Je suis allé dans cet enfer,
et j'ai fait ce que fais toujours :
essayer de découvrir
quel homme c'est.
Quel homme ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
L'homme, il y en a toujours un.
Qui fait les entrevues,
les débats publics au milieu du village,
armé jusqu'aux dents,
et qui n'attend qu'un prétexte.
Alors, je suis allé le voir,
j'ai baissé mon arme,
je lui ai montré...
que j'avais compris sa situation.
Vous pensez que je suis cet homme ?
Je veux
que vous soyez le shérif de Jericho.
Parce que les gens vous ont suivi
sur le champ de bataille,
ils vous respectent.
Aidez-moi à faire mon boulot,
aidez ces gens à passer à autre chose.
Réfléchissez-y.
Qu'auriez-vous fait si cet homme...
s'il vous avait tiré dessus ?
Réfléchissez juste à ma proposition.
Il voulait quoi ?
Aucune importance.
Réunis les rangers, on se voit ce soir.
Demain...
on va à New Bern...
On va tuer Constantino...
Voici votre priorité...
C'est une chasse à l'homme,
voici notre cible.
Le suspect est en possession
d'un engin nucléaire à fort potentiel,
du même type que ceux utilisés
lors des attaques.
Vos ordres :
tirer à vue.
On doit trouver ce terroriste
coûte que coûte.
Merci.
Pourriez-vous photocopier ça
et le distribuer ?
RECHERCHE : SUSPECTÉE DE TERRORISME.
C'est bon ?
J'ai un petit problème.
J'ai besoin d'une planque, Jake,
un endroit...
loin de toute indiscrétion.
Mon grand-père a une cabane de chasse
non utilisée depuis des années.
D'accord.
Pourquoi ? Que se passe-t-il ?
Tu sais, les infos
disent que les attaques de septembre
ont été menées
par l'Iran et la Corée du Nord.
Ouais.
Ouais, je sais.
Tu as dit
que c'était du terrorisme interne.
- C'est le cas !
- Pourquoi le gouvernement mentirait ?
- Je ne sais pas, Jake.
- Tu ne sais pas.
Je ne sais vraiment pas.
Merci.
On a rendez-vous ce soir au Bailey's
après la fermeture.
Si tu es toujours dans le coin,
j'aurai besoin de toi.
Alors, je serai là.
Vous n'aviez pas
de nourriture à Cheyenne ?
Puis-je vous parler ?
L'homme de New Bern d'hier, le tireur...
Comment le connaissez-vous ?
C'était un des adjoints de Constantino.
Quand j'ai découvert ce que Constantino
se préparait à faire à Jericho,
on a demandé à un adjoint
de m'emmener hors de la ville...
et...
De vous exécuter ?
Mais il vous a laissé partir.
Eh bien, j'ai eu de la chance.
L'adjoint qu'ils m'ont assigné
a refusé d'exécuter ce type d'ordres.
Mais ils ne refusent pas tous.
L'homme que vous avez vu hier,
c'était l'un des pires !
Je vois !
Vous pensez qu'il devrait mourir
pour ce qu'il a fait ?
Je pense qu'il y a eu assez de morts
dans le coin ces derniers temps, non ?
Je voudrais que vous fassiez la liaison
entre les gens de New-Bern et Jericho.
Excusez-moi ?
Il me faut quelqu'un
avec des contacts des 2 cotés.
- Pourquoi je ferais ça ?
- Pourquoi pas ?
Eh bien, je...
Le Colonel Hoffman dit
que vous avez eu du cran avec eux.
Il vous a recommandée en particulier.
Je supposais
que vous auriez voulu aider.
Je reviens juste d'une ville où des gars
armés et en uniforme rendaient la vie...
très désagréable.
Et vous ne pouvez pas faire
la différence entre moi et Constantino ?
Je vais me doucher avant que tu me
laisses pour un type moins dégoulinant.
Dis-moi
que tu n'as pas signé ce contrat.
Je n'ai pas signé ce contrat.
Ouais, j'ai signé l'autre.
Ça, c'est une copie.
Pourquoi tu as fait ça ?
- Tu ne l'as pas lu avant ?
- Si, je l'ai lu !
- Imbécile.
- Quoi ? Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Eh bien...
Pour commencer, tu leur dois...
une partie de ta récolte dès maintenant,
mais tu ne seras pas crédité
avant 3 ans, regarde, jusqu'à...
ce qu'un système monétaire national
soit rétabli par le gouvernement fédéral
et qu'un taux de change soit établi.
Et alors ?
Alors...
et si ça leur prend
des années pour rétablir l'économie ?
Tu continueras
à leur donner tes récoltes.
Non, je donne des récoltes un moment,
puis je n'ai plus de dette, non ?
C'est comme ça
que tu t'es endetté la première fois.
Tu sais, je vais prendre une douche.
- Écoute, attends, je...
- Non, toi, tu écoutes.
Je ne suis pas stupide.
On a entendu que New Bern
était complètement verrouillée,
couvre-feu, checkpoints militaires
tout autour de la ville mais...
On pense avoir trouvé une solution.
Ils font
travailler Constantino à l'usine.
Il en sort vers 8 heures tous les soirs.
La sécurité est plutôt légère
lors de ce changement d'équipe.
Donc si on l'attaque ici,
exactement ici,
on a une chance de faire un bon tir,
puis de partir sans se faire prendre.
Où vas-tu ?
Je rentre chez moi.
Tout à coup, tu as une conscience ?
Tu sais...
Si tu étais intelligent,
tu laisserais passer trois mois,
attendant que tout se calme,
puis tu irais là-bas discrètement,
au milieu de la nuit, et
tu tuerais Constantino dans son sommeil.
Parce que ça,
j'aurais compris mais ça,
ce n'est qu'un grand show "à la Jake"
et c'est à la fois dangereux et stupide.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui, exactement.
Je ne veux pas y être associé.
Il a refusé ?
Oui, on dirait bien.
On réussira.
Tu ne veux pas l'entendre, mais...
tu ne devrais peut-être pas participer.
Voyons.
Après ce qu'il s'est passé
chez le Major aujourd'hui,
il te surveille de près.
Tu crois vraiment
que je ne vais pas y participer ?
C'est bien ce que je pensais...
- Bon, à demain.
- Ouais, dors bien.
Montez.
C'est à quel sujet ?
Je veux vous montrer quelque chose.
Excusez-nous, soldat.
Vous l'avez exécuté ?
Non.
Je l'avais renvoyé à New Bern.
Plus tôt dans la soirée,
lui et 3 hommes armés
ont été trouvés non loin de là,
se dirigeant vers Jericho.
Quand on a essayé
de les appréhender,
ils ont commis l'erreur d'ouvrir le feu.
Cet homme...
n'a pas su mettre sa vendetta de côté,
alors, nous l'avons fait pour lui.
Sont-ils...
Vous vouliez savoir ce que j'aurais fait
si ces insurgés m'avaient tiré dessus ?
Voilà ce que j'aurais fait.
Parfois, la seule façon
de mettre un terme à ça,
c'est de commencer à retirer
des éléments de l'équation.
Je pense que vous devez vous demander...
si votre père aurait voulu que ça se
termine avec vous dans un de ces sacs.
Mon père est mort.
Faut qu'on parle du contrat
signé avec Stanley Richmond.
On l'envoie en ce moment même.
Déchirez-le.
Désolée, M. Richmond les a signés,
on ne doit plus pouvoir les annuler.
Stanley a tendance à signer des trucs
sans faire attention.
Entre autres,
4 années de déclarations fiscales
mal datées,
ce qui l'a rendu coupable
de plusieurs crimes fédéraux.
Mais j'avais cru comprendre que Cheyenne
avait accordé une amnistie
pour les crimes fédéraux non violents
commis avant les attaques
donc, techniquement,
je suppose que vous avez exposé
<i>Jennings And Rall</i>,
à une grosse procédure civile
pour l'avoir impliqué dans cet accord,
en vous basant sur des impôts
qu'il ne doit plus.
Eh bien, on dirait que je vais devoir
en discuter avec mon patron.
Je crois bien, oui.
Je t'en prie, ne piétine pas,
et ne fais pas de mouvements brusques
vers ce four, d'accord ?
Tu fais un gâteau...
Je cuisine... parfois.
Depuis quand ?
Quand j'étais petite.
C'est faux.
Une fois, j'en ai fait un...
Et...
Et ça a mal fini.
Parce que... ?
- À cause de l'incendie...
- Oui, qui aurait pu être évité en...
Laisse-moi tranquille.
C'est pour ta mère.
Ça fait 4 semaines que ton père...
Elle veut juste rester au ranch.
Fais-le à sa manière.
Mais je veux le faire à ma manière,
- c'est sa recette préférée donc...
- Non, c'est celle de mon père.
Il la suppliait
de le faire et ensuite, il...
s'asseyait là
et lui disait comment faire.
Elle disait
qu'il la rendait folle avec ça.
C'était un jeu entre eux.
Dieu qu'il l'aimait...
Il t'aimait aussi, tu sais.
Pas toujours.
Que crois-tu qu'il aurait pensé
si Constantino s'en sortait comme ça ?
Je pense qu'il en aurait été malade,
mais je ne pense pas
qu'il aurait aimé ton plan.
Alors, tu es au courant ?
Je crois qu'il aurait préféré que
sa mort mette fin à la guerre et non...
et n'en déclenche pas une autre.
Ouais.
Jake.
Eric t'a contacté ?
Non, pourquoi ?
Parce qu'il a pris un revolver
et est parti avec quelques rangers.
Sam et Allison sont chez les Taylor
et j'ai dit à Marga que...
nous avions des problèmes à la maison.
J'ai eu ça aussi.
Tu avais raison.
Ils recherchent Sarah, pas toi.
J'ai dit que je ne voulais pas
que tu prennes part à ça.
Je sais, je ne t'ai pas écouté.
- Darcy, ce n'est pas...
- On est ensemble, je veux aider.
C'est quoi ?
C'est ce qui est arrivé sur le fax
de Beck ces derniers jours.
Et ce sont des copies, j'espère.
J'ai replacé les originaux
à leur place dans les 2 minutes.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Qu'est-ce que c'était ?
Tu es sûre de ne pas avoir été suivie ?
- Oui, enfin, je ne pense pas.
- Merde...
Ce n'est pas un "oui".
Tu sais quoi faire.
Bordel, qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Je m'occupe de ça pour nous deux.
En partant sans moi ?
J'essaie de te protéger.
Tu n'aurais jamais accepté
de te retirer.
- Rentre à la maison, Jake.
- On rentre tous !
Pas moi.
Ce n'est pas
ce que papa aurait voulu, Eric.
Peut-être pas de ta part.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Tu penses avoir perdu plus que moi ?
C'est ça ?
Tu crois avoir perdu plus que moi ?
- T'as pas passé un mauvais mois, toi.
- C'était mon père !
Eh bien, il était tout pour moi.
Tu n'as aucune idée
de ce que j'ai perdu.
Maintenant, tire-toi de mon chemin.
Persuadez-moi
que ce n'est pas ce que je crois !
- C'est bon, on contrôle la situation.
- Je vous arrête là,
car si c'est bien ce que je crois,
c'est une chose
dont vous devrez répondre.
J'ai entendu dire qu'il y avait
un groupe armé sur cette route,
vers New Bern.
Donc j'ai rassemblé la patrouille,
pour leur barrer la route.
Vous réalisez...
que surveiller les zones frontières,
c'est mon boulot, pas le vôtre ?
C'était notre boulot
depuis un moment maintenant,
les vieilles habitudes ont la vie dure !
On va vous escorter en ville,
pour votre sécurité.
Qu'on soit clair...
vous avez sauvé la vie
de votre frère ce soir.
Et il n'est pas le seul ici
qui va avoir besoin de ce genre d'aide.
Lâche-la.
Maintenant, retourne-toi lentement,
et viens me donner l'accolade.
Chavez.
Hawkins.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
C'est le point de ralliement, non ?
Mieux vaut tard que jamais.
Alors, baisse ton arme.
T'as perdu la main, vieux.
Il y a 10 ans,
je n'aurais jamais pu venir si près.
Peut-être.
Ça ne t'énerve pas ?
Pas vraiment.
Alors, tu vas la poser ?
Chavez.
- C'est ma femme, Darcy.
- Darcy...
voilà Chavez.
Allons-y.
Qui d'autre de l'équipe
a réussi à revenir ?
Victor a été le premier.
Il n'a pas tenu longtemps.
Radiations de Denver...
Et ensuite...
Sarah.
- Sarah ?
- Ouais.
Ça a mal fini pour elle.
Je t'avais dit d'être prudent avec elle.
Et tu avais raison.
Merci.
Il ne reste que nous trois alors ?
Toi, moi...
et Chang.
Des contacts avec Chang ?
Il est posté à Cheyenne.
J'ai perdu le contact en infiltrant
cette armée et finissant au Nebraska.
- Depuis combien de temps ?
- Environ un mois.
J'ai trouvé bien de rester infiltré
pour revenir au point de ralliement.
Je ne pensais pas
que ça me ramènerait vers toi.
Ouais.
C'est comme si tu t'étais mis
à découvert assez longtemps pour...
qu'ils repèrent ta position.
En effet.
Ces gens avaient besoin de moi et
je ne pouvais pas leur tourner le dos.
Et si tu es là, contre moi,
pour leur compte,
alors, je devrais te tuer.
Mec, tu es un enfoiré.
Disons ça...
Mais je me suis débrouillé pour recoller
quelques morceaux.
Je sais que Valente
était celui qui agitait...
la laisse de Sarah.
- Je ne savais pas.
- Ouais, il...
Il fait partie du gouvernement
de Cheyenne maintenant.
Mais je ne sais pas avec quel pouvoir.
C'est un vrai pourri,
donc je ne suis pas surpris.
Qu'as-tu appris jusque-là ?
Tu as une carte ?
Tu sais, j'ai l'original juste là.
Je ne suis pas avocat mais je ne
pense pas que ça change quelque chose.
Je me suis arrangée
pour qu'ils en renvoient un.
- Quoi ?
- Ouais.
Pas seulement, j'ai aussi obtenu
un tracteur, des semences et le reste.
Et à un prix plus juste.
Et ils vont aussi t'aider
à remplir les papiers qui permettront
d'éponger tes impôts officiellement
avec Cheyenne et cette partie est...
gratuite, en signe d'excuses.
Et...
Et ils m'ont aussi offert un travail,
ce qui doit être une sorte de défense.
Toi,
tu es terrifiante.
Je n'aime pas les gens qui cherchent
des ennuis à ma famille.
Je suis désolée
de t'avoir demandé de m'épouser.
Non, écoute,
j'allais te faire ma demande.
Ah bon ?
J'allais le faire, ouais,
j'avais tout prévu,
j'allais te demander
comme mon père l'avait fait à ma mère.
Comment il a fait ?
C'est lui qui a demandé.
Je suis désolée.
Je...
Je suis très obstinée sur mon but,
tu vois, je...
vois que quelque chose
doit se faire et je le fais.
C'est que parfois...
je pense que...
si je ne pousse pas les choses,
elles n'arriveront pas,
parce que personne ne les voudrait
autant que je le veux.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
C'est l'alliance de ma mère.
Maintenant, s'il te plaît...
tais-toi.
Je n'ai jamais aimé personne
comme je t'aime.
Et je ne peux pas me souvenir
de ma vie avant toi.
Et...
Maintenant, je sais
que je ne pourrais pas vivre sans toi.
Écoute, je ferai tout
pour te rendre heureuse,
je le jure devant Dieu.
Donc...
Veux-tu m'épouser ?
Tu... tu vois,
maintenant, tu peux parler.
Oui.
Oui.
Oui, je veux t'épouser.
Je veux que tu entendes ça.
L'histoire du gouvernement de Cheyenne
à propos de l'attaque,
l'Iran, la Corée du Nord,
- on sait que c'est un mensonge.
- Bien sûr, mais pourquoi ?
Qu'est ce qu'ils cachent ?
Quoi que ce soit, ils ont rayé
deux pays de la carte pour se couvrir.
Il y a quelque chose de malsain
dans ce gouvernement.
Personne ne sait
si ça a commencé avec Valente ou non.
Tous les États de l'ouest
sont sous contrôle de Cheyenne,
tous ceux à l'ouest du Mississippi,
ils sont forts et
le deviennent de plus en plus.
À l'est, à Colombus, Ohio,
se trouvent...
ce qui reste
de l'ancien gouvernement.
Ils sont faibles
et perdent vite leurs soutiens.
Combien de temps
avant que Cheyenne ait tout ?
C'est là qu'un indécis entre en jeu.
Un territoire indépendant
avec présence militaire significative
et un nombre important
de réserves de guerre.
Ils n'ont pas encore choisi leur camp.
Le Texas...
Le Texas est sur le point
de signer avec Cheyenne.
Si ça arrive,
la partie est finie.
C'est notre nouvelle mission :
révéler le secret de Cheyenne
avant qu'il ne contrôle tout le pays.
Et c'est là
que les bonnes nouvelles arrivent.
Ah ouais.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
J'ai des preuves qui peuvent
exposer toute leur couverture.
J'ai une des bombes...
Peut-être même la seule.
C'est sûr que c'est un bon début.
Je comprends,
mais avec tout mon respect, monsieur...
nous ne sommes pas prêts pour ça.
Non, monsieur.
Non, monsieur.
Oui, j'apprécie.
Merci, monsieur.
Jake...
Je suis juste...
venu pour...
pour accepter votre offre.
Comment vous saviez ?
Je vous l'ai déjà dit,
je suis bon dans ce que je fais.
J'aimerais vous dire
de ne pas vous inquiéter,
mais votre baptême du feu de shérif
de Jericho ne saurait tarder.
Comment ça ?
Vous avez entendu parler
de la tournée présidentielle ?
Oui, aux infos.
Je viens de recevoir un appel
m'informant que Jericho y a été ajouté.
Le président est en chemin.

<i>Jericho.</i>
<i>A small town in Kansas that witnessed
a series of nuclear attacks</i>
<i>that destroyed 23 American cities</i>
<i>in a single day.</i>
<i>The attacks crippled
and fractured the US government</i>
<i>and left our town cutoff from the world.</i>
Please help us.
If this country is at war,
we need to know it.
<i>But even in the worst of times,
it's possible to find the best</i>
<i>in ourselves and in others.</i>
<i>Robert Hawkins.</i>
<i>A covert agent
who was supposed to stop the attacks</i>
<i>is now hunted by his former bosses</i>
<i>for the secret he holds.</i>
What is that?
<i>A Nuclear Bomb.</i>
There were dozens of these things
used in the attacks, right?
And now you have the last one.
Evidence.
It's the smoking gun
behind the greatest crime
in the history of the world.
Now, as we're about to be overwhelmed
by a hostile neighboring town,
a new government appears.
Based out of Cheyenne, Wyoming,
a government with a new face,
flying a new flag.
Now!
Hold him back.
Hold him back.
Sit down!
I'm Major Beck,
10th Mountain Division.
Colonel Hoffman asked me to sort out
what the hell happened here.
I'm in the process of taking reports,
sounds like you two are the ringleaders.
A couple hours ago,
you were leading the nastiest border
skirmish we've seen in months.
All-in, 136 dead Americans.
Twice that wounded.
Over 70,000 rounds
of ammunition confiscated...
Stanley...! Go!
<i>Go!</i>
Anything you want to say?
We needed food,
water and supplies.
Jericho had those things.
We tried to trade peacefully,
Jericho responded with hostility,
ending with the cold-blooded
murder of eight of my deputies.
Starving,
facing a hostile neighbor,
we had to take action.
Your story?
My story?
He held us hostage.
Tortured my brother.
Terrorized us with mortars.
Peace?
You didn't want peace,
you wanted everything we had.
They attacked us.
They cost us...
I don't know how many men and women.
You cost me my father.
All right.
The dispute between these two
towns is now officially over.
- This isn't over.
- Yes, it is.
In case you missed
the message earlier today,
I have the means to make this stick.
I'm going to be overseeing this area,
and conducting a full investigation
into the events that lead to today.
That's not good enough.
Come here.
You have no idea what we've lost.
But there's
a reason I was asked
to administer this area.
I'm good at what I do.
Go home.
Be with your family.
Treat your wounded and mourn your dead.
Then...
help us rebuild this place.
The nightmare's over.
Order will be restored.

<i><i>It is now six months,</i>
<i>since the day that changed
the course of human history.</i>
<i>Over 15 million left dead or dying,</i>
<i>another 40 million homeless.</i>
<i>And the remaing elements
of the Federal government</i>
<i>left scattered to the winds.</i>
Soon, evidence began to mount</i>
<i>that the financing and bombs
used in these attacks</i>
<i>had been supplied by elements
within the</i>
<i>Iranian and North Korean governments.</i>
<i>But the remnants
of the old Federal government</i>
<i>were paralyzed by indecision;</i>
<i>and the international community
refused to act.</i>
<i>So began the rise
of a National hero.</i>
<i>The junior Senator from Wyoming,
John Tomarchio,</i>
<i>rallied the country...</i>
Hey, what the hell, man?
<i>... retaliatory strikes against
America's enemies.</i>
<i>Sorry.
<i>You've been watching the same
thing for a week now.
<i>It's just the same story,
over and over again.
<i>What is it you think you're gonna miss?
I'm waiting for them to explain
what happened with the flag.
They have explained.
About 400 times.
They're putting the country
back together,
but not everybody's on board yet.
Just the states west of the Mississippi.
<i>... day three of his whistle-stop tour</i>
<i>through the western allied states.</i>
<i>Today was Pete Britton's operation. I,
I came by to see how it went.
And?
I'm
<i>surprised he lasted that long
with all the shrapnel he took.
So,
what's the total now?
- Sixty-four?
- Five, sixty-five.
Sixty-five.
I gotta say,
I don't know what kind
of punishment this
Beck guy has in store for New Bern...
... but I'd like to be there
when it goes down.
Hi.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey, babe.
Doing a little business
with Jennings & Rall?
Yeah, they're helping me organize
a community service program
for the high school.
What?
Nothing. It's just a little strange
having them here.
Army can't do everything.
J&R just does the day-to-day stuff.
Help deliver supplies
and getting people back to work.
I've seen what they do.
- Meaning what?
- Hey!
You know how hot it makes me
when you completely tune me out.
Hey!
Jake?
<i>Knock it off!</i>
<i>What's going on?!</i>
- You think he's from New Bern?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
Damn it!
Robert, you scared the hell out of me.
I missed you, too.
How long have you been standing there?
A minute or two.
Only just got home.
I told you I had to take the satellite
linkup on the road
to see who was tracking us.
- That was four days ago.
- I know, but...
a few hours after I linked up,
there was heavy military activity
in the area.
But I wanted to see where it went.
Two days after,
they set up a base camp.
Who, the new government?
- But they were the ones tracking you.
I- think
Valente is working with them now.
You know, Rob,
this town is crawling with soldiers.
Is it safe to be here?
If Valente is calling the shots,
then he is not looking for me.
Remember he thinks that you,
me and the kids
were all killed months ago.
He'd be looking for the person
who killed us.
He's looking for Sarah.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.
I'm sure.
You know, the,
the commander asked me to stay
on in the office
to do their administrative work.
- No.
Yeah, I could try to find out
what they know.
And look, you're going to need eyes
and ears inside that camp.
Thank you,
but no.
- Rob...
- Darcy.
What happened here?
Come on. You know exactly what happened.
Another thug from New Bern
with a blood feud.
That's a dozen in two weeks.
We stopped just as many men
heading in the other direction.
- Is he talking?
- <i>No, sir, nothing.</i>
- All right, get him processed.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
Heather?
Heather!
Oh, my God.
"Don't worry, Jake.
It'll just be a few days."
How are you? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
- Yeah?
Yeah. Major Beck was
nice enough to let me
hitch a ride back here
on his convoy, so I...
Hey, you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
You'll be planting your
spring crop in no time.
And my tax debt, that's in there, too?
Yeah. As good as gone.
That's great.
Your wife?
Not yet. I wanted to make sure my,
debts were settled first, but...
These are the days I love my job.
Hey.
Mimi, this is Trish Merrick.
She's with Jennings & Rall.
- Hi.
- You've got a great guy here, Mimi.
Yeah, he'll do.
- We'll talk later.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.
Did you see that skin?
It's like porcelain. That girl's never
had restless night's sleep in her life.
And here I am, running five miles a day
so my butt doesn't hit my ankles.
Mimi!
I own my farm again.
What?
I own my farm again. Jennings & Rall
just helped me set up deal
with the new government
to wipe out my IRS debt.
I give them a portion of my crop
for three years, and as of now,
I own my farm free and clear.
Can you believe it?
That's wonderful! Yeah.
- Stanley, that's so wonderful.
- Yeah.
Marry me.
- Wait. What?
- Marry me.
I love you.
And the war's over.
The lights are on, life is good.
Let's get married.
What do you say?
I...
I just...
- This is like my worst nightmare.
- No. Mimi, look...
Just forget said anything. Just scratch
it, okay? It was just a bad joke.
Listen to me. Will you just listen?
Just a poorly idiot. Stop it.
Of course I'll marry you.
I- I love you. I just wanted it...
You don't understand. I, I just...
You know what? Forget it, forget it.
Never mind.
Yes. Yes, I'll marry you.
I don't want your pity.
Not... Wait. I...
Let's get married, okay?
Let's-let's...
Let's get married.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Well, maybe you should kiss me.
Jeez!
Come here.
Gentlemen, listen up.
Got some updates for you.
As of this morning,
we've restored power to 70% of town.
And we anticipate full capacity
by the end of this month.
All things considered,
Jericho's on the fast track to recovery.
That's good news.
After what we've been through,
- it's good to finally...
- He's not done.
What's that?
He hasn't given us the bad news yet.
No, I haven't.
New Bern?
The tribunals?
I've determined
that New Bern is likely at fault
for the hostilities between you.
But?
In the spirit of reconciliation.
You got to be kidding me.
Reconciliation?
... it is in everyone's interest
to extend a blanket of amnesty
over a wide range of acts
committed during the lawless
period after the attacks.
Constantino can't just
walk away from this.
To be fair,
he's been removed from office.
We're not just going to let this go.
- Jake. Let him explain.
- I don't want an explanation, Gray.
Yeah, well, I do!
This guy's been helping
to protect us from a world
that frankly has been kicking
our ass for the last six months.
Constantino is responsible for
the deaths. A chance to make his case.
Of over 60 men and women in this town,
including my father.
There isn't going to be any
reconciliation until he's dead.
I want you all to pay close attention
to what I'm about to say.
There will be no vigilantism
in my jurisdiction.
There will be no
revenge killings. Period.
Get the door.
Four years ago,
I was tasked with pacifying a hot-spot
an hour outside of Kandahar.
I walk into this powder keg,
and I do what I always do.
Try to figure out who the guy is.
- What guy? What are you talking about?
- Theguy.
There's always one.
I arrange a meeting. Big public thing
in the middle of the village.
His guys are armed to the teeth,
just waiting for an excuse.
So I walk up to him.
I lay my weapon down.
I showed him
I understood his place
in the order of things.
And you think I'm your guy?
I want you to be Jericho's Sheriff.
Those people followed
you on the battlefield.
They respect you.
Help me do my job.
Help these people move on.
Think about it.
What would you have done if the guy...
if he took a shot at you?
Just think about it.
- What did he want?
- Doesn't matter.
Gather the Rangers.
We'll meet tonight. Tomorrow,
we're going to New Bern.
We're going to kill Constantino.
You a from HQ.
This is a manhunt.
And this is our target.
The suspect's in possession
of a high-yield nuclear device.
The same sort that carried out
the September attacks.
Your orders
are to shoot on sight.
We're going to find this terrorist
no matter what it takes.
Thank you.
Could you copy these
and distribute them, as well?
We okay?
So, I got a little bit of a situation.
I need a safe house, Jake.
Somewhere, um...
off the beaten path.
Well, my grandpa had a hunting cabin.
Hasn't been used in years.
Okay.
Why? What's going on?
You know the news is saying
that the September attacks were backed
by Iran and North Korea.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
- You said it was domestic terrorism.
- Which is what it was.
Why would the government lie about that?
- Gee, I don't know, Jake.
- You don't know?
I really don't know.
Thank you.
We're meeting at Bailey's tonight
after closing.
If you're still around,
I need you there.
Then I'll be there.
Do they not have food in Cheyenne?
May we have a word, ma'am?
The New Bern man
from yesterday, the shooter...
how do you know him?
He was one of Constantino's deputies.
When I found out what Constantino
was planning to do to Jericho,
a deputy was told to take me out
of town, and, um...
Execute you?
But he let you go.
I got lucky.
The deputy assigned to me refused
to take those kinds of orders.
But they didn't all refuse them.
The man you saw yesterday?
He was one of the worst.
I see.
Do you think
he should die for what he did?
Well, I think there's been enough dying
around here lately. Don't you?
I want you to be my liaison to
the people of New Bern and Jericho.
Excuse me?
I need somebody with ties to both towns.
Why would I do that?
- Why wouldn't you?
- Well...
Colonel Hoffman said you showed
a lot of guts with him.
He recommended you specifically.
I assumed you'd want to help.
I just came from a town where guys
with guns in uniforms made life...
very unpleasant.
And you can't tell the difference
between me and Phil Constantino?
Hi.
I going to take a shower before you
dump me for someone less sweaty.
Tell me you didn't sign this contract.
I didn't sign that contract.
Thank God.
Yeah, I signed the other one.
That's a copy.
Why would you do that?
Didn't you read it first?
Yes, I read it.
Stanley.
What? What, what'd I do?
Well,
first of all, you owe them
a share of your crop,
starting immediately,
but you won't be credited
the three years until, you see,
"... a national monetary system
"is reinstated by the Federal government
and an exchange rate
can be established."
So?
So...
what if it takes them years
to get the economy back together?
You're going to just keep
forking over your crop.
Well, no, I give them my crop for
a while and then I'm out of debt, right?
That's how you got into debt
in the first place.
You know,
I'm going to take a shower.
- Look, wait, I...
- No, you look.
I'm not stupid.
We're also hearing that
New Bern is under complete lockdown.
Curfews, military checkpoints
all over town, but...
But we think we found an angle.
They've got Constantino
working at the factory.
He leaves there around 8:00 every night.
Security at that shift change
is pretty light.
So if we hit him here...
... right here...
there's a chance we'll get a clean shot
and get out without getting caught.
Where are you going?
Home.
Hey. Hey!
Did you suddenly get a conscience?
Hey.
You know,
if you were smart,
you'd let three months go by,
wait until everything calms down,
and then you would go in there quietly
in the middle of the night and you would
kill Constantino in his sleep,
'cause that, I would understand.
But this, this is you just
making a big show out of it,
Jake, and it is both dangerous
- and stupid.
- Really?
Yes, really.
I can't be a part of this.
He's out?
Yeah, yeah, it looks that way.
We'll manage.
Listen.
You don't want to hear this, but
you think maybe you should
sit this one out?
Come on.
After what went down
in the Major's office today,
he has his eyes on you.
You really think there's a chance
in hell I'm going to sit this out?
That's what I figured.
- See you tomorrow.
- Sleep well.
Get in.
What is this about?
I want you to see something.
Excuse us, soldier.
- You executed him?
- No.
I sent him back to New Bern.
Earlier this evening,
he and three other armed men
were found not far from here
heading towards Jericho.
When we tried to apprehend them,
they made the mistake of opening fire.
This man couldn't put his vendetta
to rest, so it was put to rest for him.
Are they...?
You asked me what I would've done
if those insurgents had
taken a shot at me.
This is what I would've done.
Sometimes the only way
to end these things
is to start removing elements
from the equation.
I think you need to ask yourself,
if your father would've wanted
your story to end in one of these bags?
My father's dead.
Hey!
We need to talk about the deal
you made with Stanley Richmond.
The paperwork's going through
as we speak.
Tear it up.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Richmond signed those papers.
I'm not really sure we're going
to be able to void them out.
Stanley tends to sign things
without paying much attention.
Among the things he has signed are four
years of misdated income tax returns,
which made him guilty
of a number of federal crimes,
but it is my understanding that Cheyenne
has extended an amnesty
for non-violent federal crimes
committed prior to the attacks.
So, technically,
I suppose you have exposed
Jennings & Rall to a nasty civil suit
for coercing him into this deal
on the basis of a tax debt
he no longer owed.
Yeah, that sounds like something
I'm going to need to raise with my boss.
It does, doesn't it?
Please do not stomp
or make any sudden movements
next to the stove, okay?
You're making a cake?
I bake.
- Sometimes.
- Since when?
Okay, when I was a kid.
No, you didn't.
Once, I did in Home Ec.
And?
And it ended badly.
Because?
- Because of the fire.
- Right, which could've been prevented.
Leave me alone.
This is for your mother.
It's been four weeks
since your dad and...
She just wants to stay
out at the ranch,
do it her way.
Okay, well, I'm going to do it my way.
And this is her favorite recipe, so...
No, it's my dad's.
He'd beg her to make it for him and then
he'd sit right there and tell her
how to do it.
She'd pretend it drove her crazy.
It was...
it was a bit they did.
God, he loved her.
He loved you, too, you know.
Yeah, most days.
How do you think he would have felt
about Constantino getting to walk?
I think he would have
been madder than hell.
But I don't think he would have felt
good about what you're planning.
You know?
I think he would have preferred
his death end one war, not...
not start another one.
Yeah.
- Yeah, I think so, too.
- Jake...
- did Eric come talk to you?
- No. Why?
'Cause he took a gun
and went out with some of the Rangers.
Sam and Allison are at the Taylors.
I told Margaret we were
having problems at home.
I also got this.
You were right.
They're looking for Sarah, not you.
I told you I did not want you
to be part of this.
I know. I ignored you.
- This is no...
- Robert,
okay, we're in this together
and I want to help.
What is this?
That's everything that's come through
Beck's fax machine in the last few days.
And these are copies, I hope.
I put the originals back
in the paper tray within two minutes...
What was that?
Are you sure you were not followed?
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- D, that is not a yes.
You know what to do.
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm taking care of this
for the both of us.
- By leaving without me?
- I'm trying to protect you.
You never would have
agreed to sit this out.
- Now go home, Jake.
- We're all going home.
Not me.
This isn't what Dad would
have wanted, Eric.
Maybe not from you.
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?!
Do you think you lost more than me?!
Is that it?!
You think you lost more than me?!
- I think you had a few good months.
- He was my father!
Well, he was everything to me!
You have no idea what I've lost.
Now, get out of my way.
No.
Somebody convince me this isn't
what I think it is.
It's fine, we've got it under control...
Let me stop you there.
Because if it is what I think it is,
there's a certain way I need to respond.
I heard a rumor there was
an armed party on its way
to New Bern.
So, I gathered border patrol
to head them off.
Do you realize
that policing border areas
is my job, not yours?
It's been our job for a while, now.
Old habits die hard.
We're gonna follow you back into town,
make sure you get there safely.
Just so we're clear;
you just saved
your brother's life tonight.
And he's not the last one around here
who's gonna need that kind of help.
Drop it.
Now, turn around slowly...
and give us a hug.
Chavez.
Hawkins.
What the hell are you doing?
This is the rally point, isn't it?
Better late than never.
So, put it down, man.
You're getting lazy, old man.
Ten years ago,
there's no way I'd get this close.
Maybe.
That doesn't bother you?
Not really.
So, you going to put that down?
Chavez,
that's my wife Darcy. Darcy,
this is Chavez.
Let's go.
So, who else from the team
has made it back here?
Victor was first.
He didn't last long.
Radiation from Denver.
And then,
Sarah.
- Sarah?
- Yeah.
Didn't end too well for her.
I told you be careful
about her didn't I?
And you were right.
Thank you.
Just three of us left now then?
You, me,
Cheung.
Had any contact from Cheung?
He's embedded in Cheyenne.
I lost contact when I infiltrated
this army unit up in Nebraska.
- How long ago?
- A month or so.
Figured it was a good way
to stay inside
while I made my way back
to the rally point.
Didn't figure on them
bringing me right to you.
Yeah.
It's almost like you stuck your head
out long enough for them to
track your location.
I did.
These people needed my help,
and I couldn't turn my back on them.
And if you are here against me
or them,
well, I may have to kill you.
Man, you are a mess.
Well, that's as may be...
... but I did manage to put
a few pieces together.
I know that Valente is the one
who was holding Sarah's leash.
- I did not know that.
- Yeah, he's,
he's within the government
of Cheyenne now,
but I don't know in what capacity.
He's a slippery bastard.
I'm not surprised.
What do you know so far?
You got a map?
You know I've got
the original right here.
I'm not a lawyer, but I don't
think this changes anything.
I got them to rescind it.
- What?
- Yeah.
Not only that, but I got you the tractor
and the seed, all of it,
and at a fair price.
And they're also going to help you file
a petition so that you can
wipe out your tax debt officially
with Cheyenne.
Now, that part is
free of charge as an apology to us,
and,
and they also offered me a job,
which I think was part self-defense.
You...
Wow, you're terrifying.
I don't like people messing
with my family.
I'm sorry I asked you to marry me.
No, look, I was going to askyou.
You were?
I was, yes.
I had it all planned out.
I was going to propose the way my father
proposed to my mother.
How'd he do it?
Heaskedher.
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm... just a very goal-oriented
person, you know? I,
see that something needs
to be done and I do it.
It's just sometimes
I think that
if I don't make things happen,
then they won't,
because no one will
want them as much as I do.
What's that?
It's my mother's wedding ring.
Now please
be quiet.
I've never loved anybody
the way I love you.
And I can't remember my life
before you, and...
And...
... now I really don't think
I could live without you.
Listen, I'll do whatever it takes
to make you happy, I swear to God.
So,
will you marry me?
You... see, now-now you can talk.
- Yes.
- Okay.
Yes!
Yeah?
Yes, yes, I will marry...
Hey, I want you to hear this.
The Cheyenne government's
story about the attacks,
Iran, North Korea,
we know that's a lie.
The question is, why?
What are they hiding?
Whatever it is, they wiped two countries
off the map to cover it up.
It's safe to say, there's something
rotten in that government.
Who knows if it stops
with Valente or not.
The Western states have all fallen
in with Cheyenne,
everything west of the Mississippi.
They're strong and getting stronger.
The East is aligned
under Columbus, Ohio.
Remnants of the old administration.
And they're weak
and losing support fast.
How far off is Cheyenne
from winning this thing?
That's where the wildcard comes in.
An independent territory with
a significant military presence
and a massive
stockpile of oil reserves...
and they haven't chosen a side yet,
Texas.
The Texans are getting close
to siding with Cheyenne.
If that happens,
it's the ballgame.
This is our new mission.
Expose Cheyenne's secret before
they take over the whole country.
I guess this is where the good news
comes in.
Yeah? What's that?
I have evidence that could
expose the whole cover-up.
I have one of the bombs.
Maybe the only one.
Well, that certainly is a good start.
I understand, but with all due respect,
sir, we're not ready for that.
No, sir.
No, sir...
Yes, sir, I appreciate that.
Thank you, sir.
Jake.
Just,
came by to...
... to take you up on your offer.
How'd you know?
I tried to tell you before
I'm good at what I do.
I'd like to tell you not to worry,
but your trial by fire
as Jericho's Sheriff
is coming sooner rather than later.
How's that?
You heard of the President's
whistle-stop tour?
Yeah, from the news.
I've just received a call informing me
that Jericho's been added to the route.
The President's on his way.

<i>Jericho,</i>
<i>une petite ville du Kansas qui a été
témoin de 2 séries d'attaques nucléaires</i>
<i>qui ont détruit 23 villes américaines</i>
<i>en un seul jour.</i>
<i>Les attaques ont paralysé
et fracturé le gouvernement américain,</i>
<i>laissant notre ville coupée du monde.</i>
- Par pitié, aidez-nous.
- Si ce pays est en guerre,
on doit le savoir !
<i>Même dans les pires moments,</i>
<i>on peut trouver le meilleur...</i>
<i>en nous...</i>
<i>et dans les autres.</i>
<i>Robert Hawkins...</i>

<i>pour le secret qu'il détient :</i>
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
<i>... une bombe nucléaire.</i>
Des douzaines de ces choses
ont servi pour l'attaque, non ?
Et là, tu as la dernière...
... Preuve.
Un indice flagrant du plus grand crime
de l'histoire de l'humanité.
<i>Puis,</i>
<i>alors qu'on est sur le point
d'être envahis par une ville voisine,</i>

<i>un gouvernement avec un nouveau visage,</i>
<i>dressant un nouveau drapeau.</i>
Maintenant !
<i>Précédemment dans Jericho...</i>
<i>Je suis le Major Beck,</i>
10e division Alpine.
Le conflit entre ces deux villes
est officiellement terminé.
<i>À l'heure actuelle, on a rétabli

La reconstruction de Jericho

Je veux
que vous soyez le shérif de Jericho.
J'aimerais vous dire
de ne pas vous inquiéter,
mais votre baptême du feu de shérif
de Jericho ne saurait tarder.
- Comment ça ?
- Le président est en chemin.
<i>VIENS DEHORS.</i>
Stanley ?
Bonjour !
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
C'est pour fêter ton premier jour
de boulot chez <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
Peux-tu être encore plus gentil ?
Probablement pas.
Ça a l'air excellent.
Je sais, c'est...
C'est un grand jour !
Tu retournes à la comptabilité...
Calculs, additions...
peut-être quelques soustractions,
c'est ça ?
Tu sais, je dois avouer être impatiente
de retourner au bureau.
Tu ne reviendrais pas de l'organisation
des gens de <i>Jennings & Rall</i>,
tout a un code-barre.
Tout m'a tant manqué :
les codes-barres, les bilans comptables.
Je veux dire : le moindre élément,
paquet, nourriture,
toute sortie est comptabilisée,
où c'était... où ça va...
J'avais oublié à quel point l'ordre
pouvait être agréable.
C'est sans doute l'histoire
la plus ennuyeuse de ces derniers mois.
Non.
Je l'adore !
Enfin, il y a quelques semaines,
on était assis à cette table,
à chercher comment défendre notre ferme
de la ville voisine, et maintenant...
on est assis ici, à manger
des pancakes aux éclats de chocolat,
bavardant du suivi des colis,
c'est juste...
On est ennuyeux !
Oui, on est ennuyeux !
Ouais, c'est vrai.
Stanley Richmond ?
Oui.
Bonjour,
Ken Calley, adjoint du directeur
de la communication du président.
- Du président ?
- Oui, madame.
Le président Tomarchio veut s'adresser
à la nation aujourd'hui...
depuis...
... d'ici même,
de votre patio.
Évacuez les voitures restantes, OK ?
Shérif Green !
Bel uniforme !
J'y travaille.
C'est un début.
Et aujourd'hui,
vous et vos hommes
devrez porter ces accréditations.
Mes hommes dévient la circulation
et je leur ai dit de surveiller
tout événement inhabituel.
Mais je pense que les services secrets
couvrent vos arrières.
Allez, pourquoi avez-vous
besoin de moi ?
Vous essayez de me garder à l'oeil ?
La population locale est toujours
la meilleure surveillance.
On veut connaître
les risques potentiels de la zone.
Condor sera là
dans quelques heures.
Condor ?
C'est le nom de code du président,
le plus grand oiseau de l'ouest...
<i>Le poste de surveillance
est à la mairie.</i>
<i>Le président</i> s'arrêtera
d'abord devant <i>J & R</i>,
avant de se rendre
à la ferme pour le discours.
Combien de temps doit-il être
dans la rue principale ?
Vingt minutes.
Serrer quelques rangées de mains,
féliciter le maire.
On devrait agir à ce moment-là.
Tu as le mot de passe ?
Je l'aurai.
Par où on se replie ?
Alors, là...
Tu fuiras par là.
Tu auras un moyen de transport, ici.
On aura des diversions, ici, et ici.
Ça devrait te laisser le champ libre
assez longtemps pour filer.
J'espère juste qu'on parviendra
à faire ça sans griller ta couverture.
Si j'ai intégré l'armée,
c'est pour dévoiler la vérité,
et la vérité va éclater.
Si tout se passe bien, demain
à cette heure-là, je serai au Texas.
Nous changerons l'histoire.
Ou... nous serons morts.

Ils appellent ça :
"La Maison Blanche sur roues" !
Tout est déchargé et rechargé
à chaque étape du voyage.
Les structures de contrôle
et de commandement
sont ce qu'elles étaient
avant les attaques.
Le président pourrait
faire la guerre d'ici.
Changement de plans ! Le président
a supprimé une étape de son itinéraire.
L'heure d'arrivée
prévue dans trois heures
est maintenant prévue dans 28 minutes.
Compris !
Lieutenant Parker,
prenez une patrouille et sécurisez
le périmètre une dernière fois.
À vos ordres,
j'envoie tout de suite une patrouille.
Non, je veux
que vous y alliez, Parker.
On a besoin de monde dehors
aujourd'hui.
Oui, monsieur.
Pourquoi était-ce si long ?
On a un problème.
Les services secrets
ont raccourci l'étape précédente,
le président sera là
dans moins de trente minutes.
- On peut gérer ça.
- Ce n'est pas le problème.
Chavez a été envoyé en patrouille.
A-t-il le mot de passe ?
Je ne sais pas.
En tout cas, s'il l'a eu,
il n'a pas pu me le donner.
- Et s'il ne revient pas à temps ?
- À mon avis, ce sera le cas.
Donc je vais devoir
le faire moi-même.
Comment, Robert ? Tu ne passeras jamais
toute cette sécurité.
Je vais devoir me procurer
un de ces talkies-walkies sécurisés.
Je peux en avoir un.
Chérie, il ne s'agit pas
d'écouter aux portes ou...
photocopier quelques fax,
c'est très sérieux.
Oui, il s'agit de voler un talkie-walkie
sans se faire remarquer...
Je peux le faire.
Je réalise à quel point j'ai laissé
cette maison se dégrader.
Je trouve que les trous
font bien ressortir les rideaux.
Tu parles de l'herbe ?
Je cherche toujours à faire accepter
notre liste de mariage
à la Sécurité Intérieure.
Tu as déjà prévu
une liste de mariage ?
Depuis que j'ai 12 ans...
Et je vire de la liste
les trucs luxueux qu'on a déjà,
comme tes lunettes collector Star Wars.
D'accord, alors, j'espère que tes amis
peuvent y mettre le prix, parce que...
je n'invite personne qui peut
nous offrir une cafetière expresso.
Je vais aller m'assurer
qu'ils n'abîment pas le plancher.
Elle n'a personne à inviter.
Réfléchis un peu !
C'est un logiciel
de reconnaissance faciale,
ça crée une image 3D
de chaque visage,
et la compare à une base de données
gardée en salle de surveillance.
Les noms qui ressortent sont exclus
du périmètre de sécurité aujourd'hui.
Depuis quand
une base de données de criminels
croise les registres électoraux,
les permis de conduire,
et les registres de bibliothèques ?
Septembre 2006.
Regardez ceux qui sont ressortis
jusqu'à maintenant,
je pourrais le faire,
mais vous les connaissez mieux que moi.
Faites-moi savoir
s'il y en a dont je dois m'inquiéter.
Vous devez savoir
que je pourrais être dedans.
Vous n'y êtes pas.
Vous avez vu mon dossier ?
Je ne sais pas, beaucoup de dossiers
passent sur mon bureau.
Gray, vous avez une minute ?
Oui, j'allais justement venir...
te chercher, M. Calley m'a demandé
d'accueillir le président.
J'espérais... Éric, que Jake et toi
vous joindriez à moi.
Je...
Désolé, j'ai loupé quelque chose ?
Montre-lui ce que tu m'as montré.
<i>J & R</i> vient de recevoir un arrivage
de ce nouveau manuel d'histoire.
Ils veulent le distribuer
d'ici la fin de la semaine.
Et en quoi est-ce un problème ?
Regardez la table des matières.
Le chapitre après la 2e guerre mondiale
est appelé
"Déclin et chute de la 1re République".
Ça dit comment les USA sont morts,
pour avoir été faibles,
que la crise des missiles cubains fut un
échec car on n'a pas attaqué les Russes,
qu'on s'est retirés trop tôt du Vietnam
en 75, que des trucs comme ça.
Que doit-on faire ?
Je ne sais pas.
Vous ne savez pas ?
Que puis-je dire ?
Utilisez-le ou non,
c'est votre classe, votre décision.
C'est bien plus grave, Gray.
Ce nouveau gouvernement
commence par changer le drapeau,
et maintenant, notre histoire ?
Quand avouerons-nous
ne pas reconnaître ce pays ?
Ces gens ont sauvé
cette ville de l'anéantissement,
sans parler des millions de personnes
actuellement en vie grâce à eux.
Je ne sais pas, je pense
qu'ils ont droit à leur propre opinion.
Ces terroristes sont
de plus en plus mignons, non ?
Je peux vous aider ?
- Alex Utley.
- Jake Green.
Le <i>Modesto Bee</i>, hein ?
Le 2e plus grand journal de Californie,
vous savez...
Je peux peut-être
vous aider un peu.
C'est une blague ?
Je ne crois pas.
Une amie à vous ?
Elle est enseignante.
Elle est fichée à cause de son père.
Jonah Prowse.
Qu'a-t-il fait ?
Il dirigeait
une bande de pirates de la route.
Je ne sais pas vraiment en quoi
ça fait d'elle une menace.
Je crois qu'ils ont dit
qu'il ne fallait rien minimiser.
Vous êtes journaliste
pour eux ou contre eux ?
Oui.
<i>Attention, le Condor arrive.</i>
<i>Le Condor arrive.</i>
<i>Président Tomarchio !</i>
<i>Monsieur le président !</i>
<i>Reculez s'il vous plaît.
S'il vous plaît, reculez.</i>
<i>Reculez !</i>
<i>Président Tomarchio !</i>
- Je l'ai.
- D'accord.
Il me faut le plus de temps possible
avant de les laisser le trouver.
Retourne à la mairie.
J'arrive bientôt.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Comment ça ?
J'ai vu Darcy mettre un truc
dans son sac en salle de contrôle.
Que trafiques-tu ?
Jake Green.
Il nous manque
un talkie-walkie sécurisé.
En avez-vous pris un
en salle de contrôle ?
- Non.
- Bon, tournez-vous.
Vous, debout !
Vous étiez aussi dans la salle.
- Je connais la position...
- Allez !
Monsieur ?
Personne ne vous a dit de partir.
Le shérif et le journaliste n'ont rien.
<i>Compris.</i>
- Président Tomarchio !
- Maire Anderson,
- ravi de vous rencontrer enfin.
- Président !
Eric Green.
Mes condoléances pour votre père.
Il semblait être
un homme formidable.
J'aurais aimé le connaître.
Merci.
Je dois vous dire,
je suis vraiment désolé
des sacrifices que vous avez consentis.
Je pense que le pays
doit connaître votre histoire.
M. le Maire,
voudriez-vous réfléchir
à représenter cette région
pour la convention
sur la nouvelle Constitution ?
Une convention pour la Constitution ?
Nous avons l'opportunité d'écrire
le futur chapitre de l'histoire du pays,
faire triompher
la démocratie sur le mal.
Réfléchissez-y.
Nous aurons besoin de grands hommes
comme vous pour garder ce pays fort.
Merci, Monsieur,
je... je suis honoré.
"Alerte Condor", je répète,
"Alerte Condor".
<i>Alerte Condor, Alerte Condor.</i>
<i>Le Condor est en sécurité.</i>
Bien, Monsieur.
On a confirmation, le condor
est en sécurité à la citadelle.
"Échec et mat" déplacé sur le tableau,
bien reçu ?
Schultz,
confirmez la nouvelle position !
Darcy... attendez.
Désolé, je ne voulais pas
vous faire peur.
C'est juste que vous ne pouvez pas
quitter les bureaux, on est en alerte.
- Une alerte ?
- Une procédure des services secrets.
Si le président est jugé en danger,
tout le monde est immobilisé.
Un talkie sécurisé a disparu
il y a 15 minutes.
On reste ici
tant qu'il n'a pas été retrouvé.
D'accord.
<i>DÉBUT DU TÉLÉCHARGEMENT</i>
Asseyez-vous,
ça ne durera que quelques minutes.
Vous ne devriez pas couvrir ça ?
À Cheyenne, on n'aime pas
que ce type d'incidents soient couverts.
Ils contrôlent mes accréditations.
Quel genre de journaliste
êtes-vous ?
Du genre des bosseurs.
Pour vous, être journaliste, c'est ça ?
Ne pas faire de vagues ?
Laissez-moi vous demander :
vous avez entendu parler
du virus Hudson ?
Oui, aux infos.
Ils l'ont stoppé au Mississippi.
Ils ne veulent pas de panique,
donc on ne pourra pas publier
l'article disant
qu'il a déjà passé la ligne bleue.
La ligne bleue ?
C'est ainsi
qu'ils appellent le Mississippi.
Des troupes des Nations-Unies
surveillent toute cette ligne.
Donc, personne ne rapporte la vérité,
heureusement que vous êtes là.
Je bossais pour le L.A. Times
avant les attaques, j'ai eu 2 Pulitzer,
j'ai donc une assez bonne idée
de ce qu'est le journalisme.
Et ça n'existe plus.
Ta mère sera présente à la ferme
pour le discours ?
Elle vient de partir...
pour Cedar Brook,
voir de la famille qu'on a recontactée
depuis que les routes sont dégagées.
Ça ne doit plus être évident
pour elle de rester dans le coin.
Son absence devrait te réjouir.
Elle aurait jeté ce livre d'histoire
au visage du président.
- Voyons...
- Il n'a pas été élu, Gray.
Comment un gouvernement non élu
peut-il changer la constitution ?
Nous, on a pris le temps
de faire des élections.
Plus que quiconque,
tu aurais dû t'en souvenir.
Alors, vous êtes un vrai journaliste ?
D'après les infos, les attaques ont été
lancées avec des armes nord-coréennes,
et financées par l'Iran.
C'est ce qui s'est vraiment passé ?
Il y a plusieurs théories
parmi lesquelles choisir.
- Quelle est la vôtre ?
- Pas celle de la conspiration.
Laissez-moi deviner, vous connaissez
un gars qui connaît un gars...
Et s'il y avait autre chose
dans cette histoire ? Et si...
Et si le gouvernement savait que
ces 2 pays n'ont rien à voir avec ça ?
Et si un gars avait écrit un rapport
sur les failles de la sécurité portuaire
trois ans avant les attaques ?
Et qu'ils avaient arrêté de lire
en page 18 par manque d'enthousiasme ?
Les gens ont les infos qu'ils méritent.
Non, ils ont les infos qu'on leur donne.
Il faut juste trouver la personne
qui est prête à leur donner.
Quand j'étais enfant, deux types
ont fait tomber la Maison Blanche
avec une machine à écrire,
parce que les gens écoutaient.
Ça les mettait en colère,
ils agissaient.
Si je pensais que quelqu'un allait
m'écouter ou me croire, je parlerais.
<i>TÉLÉCHARGÉ À 55%</i>
<i>TÉLÉCHARGÉ À 62%</i>
Madame, puis-je
regarder votre sac à main ?
Est-ce vraiment nécessaire ?
Oui, Monsieur.
<i>TÉLÉCHARGÉ À 78%</i>
Vous avez cherché
dans tout le bureau, hein ?
À toutes les unités,
citadelle 2...
On a trouvé la radio, je répète,
la radio est sécurisée.
L'alerte est terminée.
- Ils ont trouvé le talkie.
- Où ?
Dans le bureau du shérif, il paraît.
Ils sont gênés d'avoir mis
autant de gens à sa recherche.
Et un personnel réduit
à la salle de contrôle.
Il a fait exprès de provoquer l'alerte.
Quoi ?
<i>TÉLÉCHARGÉ À 95%</i>
<i>TERMINÉ</i>
Halte !
Halte !
Trouvez Hawkins.
T'avais un type infiltré chez Beck
et tu ne me l'as pas dit ?
Il a blessé un de mes adjoints.
Qu'est-ce qui te fait croire ça ?
Avant que Beck l'arrête,
il m'a attaqué,
et il m'a dit de te trouver.
Regarde dans tes poches.
Vas-y.
C'est quoi cette histoire ?
Il y avait des dossiers importants
dans cette salle de contrôle.
Je les ai copiés.
Mais mon complice, Chavez, n'a pas pu me
donner le mot de passe pour les ouvrir.
Alors, il te l'a donné.
Il savait qu'en cas d'ennuis,
il pouvait se fier à toi.
Tout ça,
c'est juste pour des dossiers ?
Une conspiration de cette ampleur
laisse des traces, Jake.
Merci.
Tu sais,
tout de suite après les attaques,
les 23 lieux d'explosion
ont été testés par les militaires
pour déterminer l'origine
des matériaux de fission des bombes.
Le résultat indiquait...
que les bombes avaient été fabriquées
en Corée du Nord.
Tu veux dire
qu'ils ont falsifié les résultats ?
Oui, les résultats originaux
sont quelque part là-dedans.
Là...
Le plutonium a été traité à Seversk.
Cette bombe ne venait pas
de la Corée du Nord.
Ça venait de l'ex-Union Soviétique.
Ça prouve qu'ils ont menti
au sujet des attaques.
Ça, c'est la preuve théorique.
Et ta bombe est la preuve physique.
Malheureusement, sortir cette preuve
va être très difficile.
Comment ça ? La sortir où ?
Au Texas.
Ils vont se joindre à Cheyenne,
et s'ils le font, alors,
Cheyenne sera trop fort pour nous.
Donc il faut s'assurer
que ça n'arrive pas.
Où ont-ils emmené Chavez ?
En cellule pour l'instant,
il paraît qu'ils vont le transférer
dans un endroit appelé...
Loomer Ridge.
C'est une prison haute sécurité
au Colorado.
- D'où on ne revient jamais.
- Il est bien gardé.
Je ne vais pas
risquer la mission pour le secourir,
mais c'est Chavez
qui a les contacts au Texas.
Je vais devoir trouver un moyen
de transmettre cette info
aux bonnes personnes, tout seul.
Tu vas aller au Texas
avec la bombe dans le coffre,
chercher une personne
que tu ne connais pas ?
Tu sais, dis comme ça, Jake...
Il y a peut-être une autre manière
de faire sortir l'info.
Il y a un journaliste.
Les médias
sont à la solde de Cheyenne.
Celui-là est peut-être différent.
- Laisse-moi le tester.
- Jake...
Je te laisse à l'écart de ça, OK ?
À moins que t'aies
une meilleure idée.
Je t'ai fait confiance,
à ton tour, maintenant.
C'est beaucoup à croire sur parole.
- Vous pouvez me donner vos sources ?
- Pas pour l'instant.
Il faut d'abord convaincre votre journal
de publier l'info sur la clé USB.
Il faut que je sache
si vous nous suivrez jusqu'au bout.
- Je ne sais pas.
- Vous ne savez pas quoi ?
Bon Dieu...
C'est le plus gros scoop
de l'histoire de l'Amérique.
C'est ça le problème,
ça va foutre un bordel monstre.
C'est un bordel monstre !
OK, laissez-moi appeler mon rédacteur.
Avec les écoutes téléphoniques,
vous êtes fou ?
Vous devez quitter
le groupe de journalistes.
Vous ne pouvez parler à personne,
allez directement à Modesto.
Vous voulez que je taise ce scoop
durant 2 jours ?
C'est non négociable.
Mais vous pouvez conduire
aussi vite que vous voulez.
Ça marche ?
Deux types
et une machine à écrire, hein ?
Trish...
M. Richmond.
M. Richmond, c'est mon père,
- moi, c'est Stanley.
- Stanley, je suis assez occupée.
D'accord...
Voilà, en fait,
j'ai besoin d'une faveur.
On a le temps, ne l'ennuie pas.
Non, il ne m'ennuie pas,
je suis vraiment occupée.
Vous connaissez le langage des signes ?
Oui, c'est obligatoire
pour tous les managers de <i>J & R</i>,
d'apprendre plusieurs langues,
donc j'ai choisi le langage des signes.
Bon, alors, pour cette faveur...
Il paraît que vous êtes forts
pour localiser des trucs, j'aurais...
Il va se marier,
avec Mimi.
Elle me fait peur.
Moi aussi.
Mais il se trouve que je l'aime bien.
OK, alors quelle est la faveur ?
Attendez dehors, messieurs.
Qu'y avait-il de si important
dans cette pièce ?
C'est probablement votre dernière chance
de me dire tout avant qu'on vous jette
au fond d'un trou, Parker,
si c'est même votre vrai nom...
On a combattu ensemble.
Dites-moi au moins qui vous êtes.
Je suis un homme mort.
- Lieutenant !
<i>- Monsieur ?</i>
Envoyez ses empreintes au QG,
qu'on découvre qui il est, vite.
Je vais à la ferme pour le discours,
je t'y emmène ?
Non, on se rejoint là-bas.
C'est quoi tout ça ?
Quelqu'un a eu une crise cardiaque
au Bailey's.
Il était mort
quand ils l'ont trouvé.
On se voit là-bas.
Attendez.
Citoyens de Jericho,
je suis honoré
d'être ici aujourd'hui, devant vous,
en ce lieu si particulier.
Ceux qui sont morts ici,
ont donné leur sang pour protéger
nos vies et notre liberté.
Et pour ceci,
nous leur rendons hommage.
<i>ACCÈS REFUSÉ</i>
C'est fini.
Il est mort.
Le journaliste est mort.
Acceptez ceci
au nom d'une nation reconnaissante.
Ils l'ont tué.
S'ils l'ont tué,
pourquoi pas moi ?
S'ils te considéraient comme une menace,
ils l'auraient fait.
À mon avis,
le journaliste a appelé son journal
pour les préparer
aux révélations sur le gouvernement
et l'appel a été intercepté.
On doit trouver sa liste d'appels,
je veux savoir à qui il a parlé.
- Et je veux une autopsie.
- Jamais plus tu ne reverras ce corps.
Et heureusement qu'ils ne l'ont pas eu
vivant, sinon il nous aurait balancés.
<i>Vous avez perdu vos proches,</i>
et vous voilà ici,
toujours forts, toujours fiers.
C'est ça, le meilleur de l'Amérique.
Mais le combat
nous a rendus faibles
et vulnérables face à nos ennemis.
L'ancien gouvernement
est revenu à Colombus, Ohio.
Après les attaques, ce gouvernement...
a engagé un débat sans fin
sur les réponses à donner.
Donc en l'absence de dirigeants,
j'ai agi pour faire savoir au monde
que l'Amérique avait un genou à terre,
mais n'était pas morte !
- On ne va pas les laisser s'en sortir.
- C'est déjà fait.
Écoute, Jake, je dois réfléchir
à ce que je vais faire.
Eh bien, réfléchis,
moi, je ne peux pas laisser faire.
Il faut que tu évites
de me créer des soucis.
Le gouvernement fédéral
des états de l'est
n'a plus d'autorité
au-delà du Mississippi.
Vous voyez le drapeau ?
C'est le drapeau d'un nouveau pays,
allant du Mississippi au Pacifique.
Les 13 bandes rouges et blanches
représentent encore les 13 colonies.
Mais elles avancent
dans une nouvelle direction,
tout comme nous,
nous devons trouver notre nouvelle voie.
Dans quelques semaines,
le maire Anderson vous représentera
pendant que nous ratifierons
la Constitution de ce nouveau pays,
qui sera connu par le monde
sous un nouveau nom,
les États Alliés d'Amérique.
Et avec ce nouveau nom,
un nouveau départ.
Nos dettes ont été effacées,
et nous sommes de nouveau prêts
à faire des affaires,
ça signifie des emplois,
des provisions,
un retour à la vie
comme on la connaissait.
Et cet automne,
nous aurons des élections,
où nous pourrons tous participer
à bâtir le nouveau gouvernement
d'une Amérique plus sûre et plus forte.
Que Dieu vous bénisse,
vous et les États Alliés d'Amérique.
- Où l'emmenez-vous ?
- On le transfère.
Fils de pute !
Retenez-le !
Sortez-le de là.
Personne ne souhaite ça
plus que moi.
Il a également envoyé
un de mes hommes à l'hôpital.
Il payera, vous pouvez me croire.
Oui, Lieutenant ?
Monsieur,
le dossier de Parker est là,
il est mort.
- Comment ça ?
- L'identité et le nom de Parker
appartiennent à un soldat mort.
Soldat Parker,
armée US, tué au combat
à Jallallabad, Afghanistan,
le 11 mai 2003.
Il est des Opérations Spéciales.
Echo 3, ici Echo 1, terminé.
<i>Je voudrais un rapport sur le transfert
du prisonnier Parker.</i>
<i>Je répète :
Echo 3, ici Echo 1, parlez, terminé.
Tu as laissé ça à la ferme.
Tu n'as même pas
posé une question.
Tu n'as fait que dire oui à tout.
Je veux aller à cette convention et...
questionner le président était
le plus sûr moyen de ne pas y aller.
Bonne route.
Éric, attends.
C'était à mon père,
dans son ancien bureau
avant les travaux.
Je le croyais perdu.
Oui, je l'ai trouvé dans un placard,
quand l'armée a eu besoin de place.
J'ai pensé...
le ramener ici et l'accrocher,
mais j'ai pensé qu'il n'était pas...
à moi.
Je vais aller à Cheyenne
pour poser ces questions.
Et j'insisterai
jusqu'à obtenir des réponses.
Je ne veux simplement pas
manquer mon coup.
Et j'espérais...
que...
pendant mon absence,
tu accepterais de me remplacer.
En essayant de ne pas me laisser
trop de problèmes.
<i>Ce qui s'est passé aujourd'hui
est inacceptable.</i>
Je comprends, Monsieur.
Comment votre homme
l'a-t-il perdu ?
Aucune idée, Monsieur.
Il n'y a aucune trace
de son existence,
ni empreintes digitales, ni ADN.
Sans parler que tous les documents
avec son nom ou sa photo
ont disparu de mes dossiers.
Comment se déroulent vos recherches
sur Sarah Mason ?
C'est bien ce que je pensais.
Vous êtes dépassé...
Je vous envoie un privé
qui connaît cet endroit.
Il s'occupera de gérer la ville
au quotidien,
pendant que vous chercherez
le terroriste.
Je me creuse le cerveau
à essayer de comprendre...
comment un prisonnier menotté...
gardé par 3 soldats
a pu s'échapper d'un véhicule.
Une idée ?
J'ai entendu dire
que c'était un agent secret.
Je suppose qu'il a réussi
à prendre la clé avant de sortir.
Possible.
J'imagine que j'aurais dû y penser.
Merci pour votre aide aujourd'hui,
j'apprécie.
Un coup de main par là.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Dis-lui.
Me dire quoi ?
Rien...
Il n'y a rien à dire.
Tu as dit
que tu n'aurais personne au mariage...
... alors, on a demandé
à <i>J & R</i> de localiser ta famille.
Qu'avez-vous trouvé ?
Rien.
On a trouvé le petit cousin de ton père
dans l'Indiana, mais...
la zone avait déjà été évacuée.
Et il y avait une autre femme
du même nom,
dans un camp de réfugiés, pas loin,
mais elle n'avait aucun lien.
Merci.
Je suis désolé.
Je voulais vraiment
que tu aies ta famille au mariage.
Je l'aurai.
Tu es ma famille.
Toi et Bonnie,
venez là.
Remercie Jake de ma part.
Tu avais raison,
il a de bonnes mains.
J'aurais aimé qu'il cogne
un peu moins fort.
Moi aussi.
Darcy a nettoyé le bureau,
ils n'ont plus aucune photo
pour te chercher.
- Tu as de la chance de l'avoir.
- Oui, elle me le répète tout le temps.
Tu as tout ce qu'il te faut.
Voiture, carte...
En fait, j'ai un truc pour toi.
Il est sécurisé.
Je t'ai mis la liste de mes contacts,
je t'appellerai.
J'attendrai.
T'as entendu parler...
d'un projet "Boxcar" ?
Non, c'est quoi ?
C'était le seul dossier dans la clé USB
que le mot de passe n'ouvrait pas.
Étrange, le mot de passe
aurait dû tout ouvrir.
Je vais enquêter un peu là-dessus.
Tu te souviens
quand ce boulot était facile ?
Tu as...
Tu es au courant pour ton frère ?
Non.
Gray m'a désigné maire
en son absence.
Maire Green...
Sympa d'entendre ça à nouveau.
Mauvaise journée ?
Ouais, je crois
que la situation se complique à nouveau.
Ben, on a vu pire.
On est encore là.
On y arrivera encore.
Major Beck, 10e Division Alpine.

<i>The attacks crippled and

Jericho's on the fast track

I want you to be Jericho's sheriff.
I'd like to tell you not to worry,
but your trial by fire
as Jericho's sheriff
is coming sooner rather than later.
- How's that?
- The president's on his way.
Stanley?
Good morning.
What is this?
It's a celebration for your
first day on the job at J & R.
Could you be any sweeter?
Probably not.
This looks great.
I know. This is,
this is a big day.
You get to be an accountant again.
Count things, add things up,
may be even a little
subtraction, right?
I can't wait to work in that office.
You wouldn't believe how organized
the J and R people are.
Everything is bar-coded.
I have so missed bar codes
and spreadsheets.
I mean, every component
and package and foodstuff,
every ounce is accounted for.
Where it's been, where it's going.
I'd forgotten how beautiful
order can be.
It's probably the most boring
story I've heard in months.
No, I love it.
Just a few weeks ago,
we were sitting at this table
trying to imagine how to defend our farm
from the next town over, and now...
we're sitting here, eating pancakes
with chocolate chips in them,
and you're... blabbing on
about tracking packages.
We're boring.
We are. We're boring.
Yeah, we are.
Stanley Richmond?
Ken Calley. I'm the president's
deputy communications director.
- The president?
- Yes, ma'am.
President Tomarchio wants
to address the nation today
From...
right here, on your front porch.
Let's get the rest of these
cars out of here, all right?
Sheriff Green.
Nice uniform.
- I'm pacing myself.
- Well, it's a start.
And for today,
you've to wear these credentials.
I got deputies rerouting traffic,
they going to keep an eye
for anything unusual.
Although I think the Secret
Service has got you covered.
What do you need me for?
Trying to keep an eye on me?
Local intel always beats eye in the sky.
We want to know the
hazards in the area.
- Condor's going to be here soon.
- "Condor?"
Code name for the president.
Biggest bird in the west.
<i>The watchroom is in town hall.</i>
The president will make a stop
at J and R first
before heading out to the farm
for the speech.
How long's he scheduled
to be on Main Street?
20 minutes.
Shake some hands on the rope line,
meet the mayor
That's the best time for us
to make our move.
- You got the password yet?
- I will.
- How about evac?
- Okay.
Here...
is your escape route.
Got transportation here.
Diversions here and here.
Should give you enough time
to get out on the open road.
Just wish we can do this
without getting you burned.
Riding with the army
was for uncovering the truth,
and the truth day is coming to us.
All goes well, by this time
tomorrow, I'll be in Texas,
and we'll be changing history.
Or we'll be dead.

<i>"Condor"</i>
They call this
the White House on wheels.
It unloads and reloads
at every stop during the tour.
Command and control capabilities that
equals what we had before the attacks.
He could fight a war from here.
A change of plans.
The president has struck a stop.
That ETA of three hours
is now 28 minutes.
Copy that. Lieutenant Parker,
take a patrol out
and secure the routes one last time.
Roger that. I'll send them out now.
No, I want you to do it, Parker.
We need all eyes out there today.
Yes, sir.
What took you so long?
Got a problem.
Secret Service cut the last stop short,
so the president
will be here in 30 minutes.
- We can handle that.
- That's not the problem.
Chavez got sent out on patrol.
- Did he get the password?
- I don't know.
I mean, if he did, he didn't
have a chance to give it to me.
- What if he's not back in time?
- I thought that he's not going to be.
So I'm going to have to do it myself.
How, you'll never get
past all that security.
I got to get ahold of one of
their secure walkie-talkies.
I can get one.
Baby, this is not eavesdropping
or xeroxing some fax pages.
- This is the real thing.
- It's lifting a walkie-talkie
without being noticed.
I can do that.
I didn't realize how much
I let this place go.
The glare from the shell casings
really make the window treatments pop.
New grass?
I'm still trying to make
our wedding registry vital
to national security.
You're already planning
our wedding registry?
Since I was 12.
And I've taken off the list luxury items
that we already have,
such as your
Star Wars collector glasses.
I hope your friends are buying
the high-ticket items because
I'm not inviting anybody
who can afford an espresso maker.
I'm going to go make sure that
they're not scratching up the floors.
It's facial recognition software.
Takes a 3D picture of every face,
checks them against
the database in the watch office.
The flagged ones will be prohibited
from secure areas today.
Since when does a criminal
database cross-reference
people's voter registrations,
DMV files and library records?
September, 2006.
Take a look through the ones we flagged.
You know these people better than I do.
Let me know if there's anyone
I need to be worried about.
I should warn you I might be in there.
You aren't.
You seen my file?
I don't know. A lot of files
come across my desk.
Gray, you got a minute?
Sure. I was just going to come
looking for you.
Mr. Calley has asked me
to greet the president.
And I was hoping, Eric, that
you and Jake would join me.
I'm sorry. Am I missing something?
Show him.
J and R just received a crate
of these new history textbooks.
They'll distribute
by the end of the week.
And why is this a problem?
Look at the chapter titles.
The section after W.W.II is called
The Decline and Fall
of the 1st Republic.
It talks about how the U.S died
because we got weak.
That the Cuba's Crisis was a failure
because we didn't attack the Russians.
That we pulled out
of 'Nam in'75 too early.
- I mean, it goes on.
- How should we handle this?
I don't know.
You don't know?
What can I tell you?
Teach from it or not.
It's your classroom. Make a decision.
There's a bigger issue here, Gray.
This new government,
first they change the flag,
now our history?
At what point is this a country
we don't even recognize?
These people have saved
this town from annihilation,
to say nothing of the millions of people
who are still alive because of them.
I think that earns them
the right to a point of view.
Terrorists just keep getting
better looking, don't they?
Can I help you?
- Alex Utley.
- Jake Green.
"Modesto Bee", huh?
Second largest paper in California now.
Though we had a little help
getting there.
Is that a joke?
Guess not.
Friend of yours?
She's a school teacher.
Says she's flagged
because of her father.
Jonah Prowse.
What did he do?
He runs a road gang in the area.
Though I'm not sure why
that makes her a threat.
Well, I think they'd say that there's
no such thing as being too careful.
You reporting on them or for them?
Yes.
<i>Break, break. Condor is arriving.</i>
<i>Condor is arriving.</i>
One seconde, sir!
Mr. President! Mr. President!
- I got it.
- Okay.
I need you to give me as much time
as you can before you let them find it.
Okay, you head back to town hall.
I'm not far behind.
- What's going on?
- I don't know what you mean.
I just saw Darcy put something
in her purse, back in the watch office.
Now what are you up to?
Jake Green!
We're missing a secure walkie-talkie.
Did you take it from the watch office?
- No.
- Let's go. Turn around.
Utley, on your feet.
You were there as well.
- I'll assume the position.
- Let's go.
Sir. Nobody told you to move.
<i>The sheriff and the reporter are clean.</i>
Copy that.
Mayor Anderson, good to
finally meet you.
Mr. President.
Eric Green.
My condolences on your loss.
Your father sounded
like a wonderful man.
Wish I could have known him.
Thank you.
I have to tell you guys,
I am truly humbled
at the sacrifices you've all endured.
I think the country
needs to hear this story.
Mayor...
would you consider
representing the area
at the upcoming
constitutional convention?
- Constitutional convention?
- We have an opportunity
to write the next chapter
in American history,
the triumph of democracy
over the forces of evil.
Think about it.
We'll need good men like you guys
to help keep this country strong.
Well, thank you, sir.
I'm... I'm honored.
Crash, Condor.
Repeat: crash, Condor.
<i>Crash, Condor. Crash, Condor.</i>
<i>- Condor is secure.</i>
- Yes, sir.
I've got confirmation.
Condor is secure at the Citadel.
Checkmate is moving
to Billboard, copy that?
Schultz, please confirm
you have the new positions.
Darcy, hold it.
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
Just didn't want you wandering
outside the office. We're in a crash.
- What's a crash?
- Secret Service procedure.
If the principle's in jeopardy,
they freeze everyone where they are.
A secure walkie went missing
about 15 minutes ago.
Until that's recovered,
we stay put.
Have a seat.
This will take a few minutes.
Isn't this something
you should be covering?
No. Cheyenne doesn't like
incidents like this covered.
And they control my credentials.
What the hell kind
of reporter are you?
The working kind.
That's your idea of being a journalist,
not making waves?
Let me ask you this:
you heard of the Hudson virus?
Yeah, from the news.
They stopped it at the Mississippi.
They don't want a panic,
so they won't let us publish
reports that it's already
jumped the blue line.
- The blue line?
- Yeah, for the Mississippi.
It's got U.N. peacekeepers
all up and down it.
So nobody's reporting the real news,
and that get you off the hook?
I was working for the L.A Times
before the attacks. I won 2 Pulitzers,
so I got a good idea
about being a journalist.
And they don't exist anymore.
Is your mother going to come out
to the farm for the speech?
She just left.
Went to Cedar Brook
to stay with some family we contacted
after the roads were cleared.
It couldn't be easy for
her to be around her anymore.
You should be glad she's not here.
She'd through that history book
in the president's face.
- Come on.
- He wasn't elected, Gray.
How does a government no one voted for
change the Constitution?
We found time to have an election.
Of all people, I think
you would remember that.
So you're a real reporter, huh?
The news also says that the attacks
were North Korean weapons
financed by Iran.
- Is that the whole story?
- Well, there's...
plenty of theories
out there to pick from.
- What's yours?
- I'm not a conspiracy nut.
Let me guess,
you know a guy who knows a guy...
Now, what if there were
more to that story? What if...?
What if we had nuked 2 countries
who had not attacking us?
What if a guy wrote an expose
about the appalling gaps
in port security,
three years before the attacks,
and it ended up on page C-18
because it didn't have any zazz?
- People get the news they deserve.
- They get the news they're given.
It just takes someone willing
to give it to them.
When I was a kid, two guys
took down the White House
with a typewriter
because people listened.
They got angry, they acted.
If I thought anybody was willing
to listen anymore, I'd be talking.
Ma'am, I'd like to take a look
inside your purse.
Is that really necessary?
Yes, sir, it is.
You searched the entire office, huh?
All stations on the net.
This is Citadel Two.
We found the radio.
Repeat: the radio is secure.
<i>Copy that.</i>
Crash is over.
They found the walkie-talkie.
- Where?
- It was in the sheriff's office.
They're pretty embarrassed.
Had the whole group out looking.
And a light staff at the watch office.
He caused the crash on purpose.
What?
Halt!
Hold it!
Find Hawkins.
You had a guy inside Beck's
camp, and you didn't tell me?
- He hurt one of my deputies.
- What makes you think that?
Before Beck arrested him,
he attacked me,
and he told me to find you.
Check your pockets.
Check them.
Okay.
What's going on?
There were some very important
files in that watch room,
and I copied them,
but my guy inside, Chavez,
he couldn't get the password to me
to open them, so he gave it to you.
I told him if he was in trouble,
he could trust you.
This is all about files?
A conspiracy this big
leaves footprints, Jake.
Thank you.
You know, immediately after the attacks,
the 23 blast sites were
tested by the military
to determine the origin of the
fissile material in the bombs.
The results said
the bombs were milled in North Korea.
Are you saying
they falsified the results?
Yes. But somewhere in here
are the original results.
Here.
The plutonium was
milled in Seversk.
That bomb wasn't from North Korea.
It's an ex-Soviet nuke.
This is proof they lied
about the attacks.
Well, this is just the paper trail.
Your bomb is the hard evidence.
Unfortunately, getting
that evidence out is impossible.
What do you mean out? Out where?
Texas. They're close to joining
Cheyenne, and if they do that,
Cheyenne is going to be
too strong for us to bring down.
So we have to make sure
that that does not happen.
Now, where did they take Chavez?
They're holding him in a lockup for now.
I heard they were going
to transfer him to a place called
Loomer Ridge.
That is a supermax
prison in Colorado.
- A place you don't come back from.
- He's well-guarded.
I'm not going to risk the greater
mission trying to rescue him,
but Chavez had the contacts in Texas.
I gotta find a way
of getting this information
to the right people by myself.
Are you going to drive
to Texas with a bomb
looking for someone you don't know?
You know, when you
put it like that, Jake...
There may be another way
to get the information out.
- There's a reporter.
- The media is in Cheyenne's pocket.
This one may be different.
Let me feel him out.
I'll keep you insulated, all right?
Unless you can think of a better way.
I've been trusting you,
and now it's time you trust me.
That's a lot of information
to take on faith.
- You can't give me your source?
- No, not yet.
First you have to convince your paper
to publish the information.
I've got to know you're going
to follow this through to the end.
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?
God. This is the biggest news
story in American history.
It's going to make a god-awful mess.
It is a god-awful mess.
All right, let me call my editors now.
On a government-issued phone?
Are you crazy?
You have to leave the press pool.
You can't talk to anyone.
Drive straight through to Modesto.
You want me to sit on the biggest
news in history for 2 days?
Yeah. That part's non negotiable.
But you can drive as fast as you want.
Are you in?
Two guys and a typewriter, huh?
- Trish!
- Mr. Richmond.
Mr. Richmond's my dad. I'm Stanley.
Stanley, I'm pretty busy.
Here's the thing.
I kind of need a favor.
No, he's not annoying.
I really in busy.
Yeah. It's mandatory for all
Jennings and Rall managers
to learn many languages,
so I picked sign language.
Okay, so, about this favor.
I hear you are really good
at tracking things, so I need...
She scares me.
Okay, so, what's the favor?
Stand down, gentlemen.
What was in that room
that was so important?
This is probably your last chance
to tell me what's going on
before somebody drops you
in a hole somewhere, Parker.
If that's even your real name.
We fought together.
At least tell me who you are.
I'm a dead man.
- Lieutenant!
- Sir.
Send his prints to Camp Liberty.
We'll find out who he is soon.
Yes, sir.
I'm headed to the farm for the speech.
You want a ride?
I'll meet you out there.
What is all this?
Some guy had a heart attack at Bailey's.
He was dead when we found him.
I'll see you there.
Hold up.
Citizens of Jericho,
I am honored to be standing
here today with you
on this most hallowed ground.
Those who died here gave their blood
to protect our lives and liberties.
And so we honor them.
Detail, present colors.
It's over.
He's dead.
The reporter's dead.
Accept this on behalf
of a grateful nation.
Arms port!
Aim! Fire!
Aim! Fire!
Aim! Fire!
They killed him.
Why didn't they kill me?
Well, if they suspected you were
a threat, they would have.
Best guess, the reporter
called his paper
to prep them for the exposé
on the new government,
and the call was intercepted.
We need to get ahold of that phone log.
I want to know who he talked to.
- And I want an autopsy.
- You will never see that body again,
and we're lucky he isn't alive,
'cause he would have given us up.
<i>You've lost loved ones,</i>
and here you are again.
Still strong, still proud.
This is the best of America.
But infighting has left us weak
and vulnerable to our enemies.
Remnants of the old government
have fallen back to Columbus, Ohio.
After the attacks, that government
endlessly debated our response.
So, in a vacuum of leadership,
I acted to the world know
that America was down but not out.
- We can't let them go with this.
- They already have.
I have got to figure out
what I'm going to do now.
You figure out what you're going to do,
I can't let this go.
Jake, I need you not to be
my problem right now.
<i>The federal government
of the eastern bloc states</i>
no longer has any governing authority
beyond the Mississippi.
You've seen the flag.
This is the flag of a new country.
Flying from the Mississippi
to the Pacific.
The 13 stripes of red and white
still represent the 13 colonies,
but they run in a new direction.
Just as we... must chart
a new direction for ourselves.
In a few short weeks,
Mayor Anderson will represent you
as we ratify a constitution
for this new nation.
That will be known to the world
by a new name.
"The Allied States of America."
And with this new name, a clean slate.
Our debts have been forgiven,
and we are open again for business.
That means jobs, stocked shelves,
a return to life as we knew it.
And in the fall, we'll have elections,
where we can all take part
in building a new government.
As a safer, stronger America.
God bless you, and God bless
the Allied States of America.
- Where are you taking him?
- He's being transferred.
Son of a bitch!
Pull him off!
Get him out of here.
Nobody wants to do that more than me.
He put one of my men
in the hospital, too.
Oh, he'll get his due.
I assure you.
- Lieutenant.
- Sir, the info on Parker is back.
He's dead.
- What do you mean?
- I mean Parker's identity
belong to a dead soldier.
"RF Parker, US Army,
killed in action,
"Jalabad, Afghanistan, 11 May, 2003."
He's black ops.
Echo Three, this is Echo One, over.
<i>I need a SitRep now on the transport</i>
<i>of Lieutenant Parker to Loomer Ridge.</i>
<i>I repeat, Echo Three, this is Echo One.
Come in. Over.</i>
You left this at the farm.
You didn't even ask him one question.
All you did was say yes.
Well, I want to go to that convention,
and interrogating the president
is a good way to make sure
that never happens.
Safe travels.
Eric, wait.
It was my dad's.
Hung in his old office before
the renovations.
I thought it was lost.
Yeah, I found it in storage
when the army need the space.
I thought about
bringing down here and hanging it up,
but it just isn't...
... me.
I'm going to Cheyenne
to ask those questions.
And I'm going to keep asking
the questions until I get some answers.
I just don't want them to see me coming.
And I was hoping that
while I was gone,
that you'd be willing
to act as mayor.
And try not to get us
into too much trouble.
<i>What has happened today
is unacceptable.</i>
I understand, sir.
<i>How did your men lose him?</i>
I don't know, sir.
There's absolutely no record
of him existing.
Either through fingerprints or DNA.
Not to mention that every piece
of paper with his name or picture
has disappeared from my CP.
<i>How's your search for Sarah Mason going?</i>
<i>That's what I thought.</i>
<i>You're overwhelmed.</i>
<i>I'm sending you a private contractor
who knows the area.</i>
<i>He'll take care of the day-to-day
administration of the town</i>
<i>while you find the terrorist.</i>
Jake.
I've been racking my brain,
trying to figure out
how a handcuffed prisoner
guarded by three soldiers,
escape from the back of a Humvee.
Any ideas?
I heard he was as spook.
Figured he picked the lock on his cuffs
and fought his way out.
Sounds plausible.
I should have thought of that.
Thanks for your help today.
It's appreciated.
A little help here.
What's going on?
Tell me what?
Nothing, there's nothing to tell.
What did you find?
Nothing.
I mean, we found your
father's second cousin
on a census in Indiana, but the area
had already been evacuated.
And there was a woman
with the same last name
in a nearby refugee camp.
But she wasn't related.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Sorry. I really wanted you
to have your family at the wedding.
I will.
You're my family.
You and Bonnie...
from here on in.
Thank Jake for me.
You were right about him.
He's got good hands.
Just wish he learned to pull
his punches a little better.
Me, too.
So Darcy scrubbed the office.
There have not pictures
to trace you with.
- That's a good woman you got there.
- So she keeps telling me.
You got everything you need?
A car, map?
Actually, I got something for you.
Phone's clean.
When I get to Texas and meet up
with my contacts, I'll call.
I'll be waiting.
Say, hey...
You ever heard of a project Boxcar?
- No. What is it?
- There was a file on the flash drive.
It was the only thing
the password wouldn't open.
That's strange. That password
should open everything on that disk.
I guess I'll keep working on it.
Remember when this job used to be easy?
No.
Did you,
did you hear about your brother?
Gray appointed me
acting mayor in his absence.
Mayor Green.
Nice to hear that again, huh?
Long day?
Yeah. Things with Beck
are getting pretty dicey.
Well, we've dealt with worse.
We're still here.
We can handle it.
Major Beck, 10thMountain Division.
You Goetz?
Tactical operations officer.
I'll take it from here.

<i>Précédemment dans Jericho...</i>
Au nom du gouvernement,
on collecte nourriture et médicaments.
Le gouvernement ?
Celui qui vous a ordonné
de tuer ces gens à l'hôpital ?
Bientôt, les choses
vont revenir à la normale.
Et pour tout remettre en ordre,
savez-vous qui ils vont envoyer ?
Moi !
<i>Je prends tout,</i>
<i>j'essaierai de troquer avec des choses
pour pouvoir remplir le magasin.</i>
Ici, ça ne sert pas et j'espère troquer
ce dont la ville a besoin.
<i>Je suis le major Beck,
10e Division Alpine.</i>
À l'heure actuelle, nous avons
rétabli le courant sur 70 % de la ville.
La reconstruction
de Jericho sera vite terminée.
Je veux que vous soyez
le shérif de Jericho.
Vous avez entendu parler
du virus Hudson ?
Oui, aux infos.
Ils l'ont stoppé au Mississippi.
Ils ne veulent pas de panique,
donc on n'a pas pu publier
l'article disant
qu'il a déjà passé la ligne bleue.
- La ligne bleue ?
- Le Mississippi.
<i>Tous les États de l'ouest
sont alliés à Cheyenne.</i>
Ils sont forts
et le deviennent de plus en plus.
Notre nouvelle mission :
révéler le secret de Cheyenne
avant qu'ils ne contrôlent tout le pays.
J'ai la preuve qui peut
faire tomber toute leur couverture.
Mimi, voici Trish Merrick,
de <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
Salut.
<i>J and R nous aide
pour les trucs du quotidien,</i>
<i>comme donner le matériel et...
redonner du travail aux gens.</i>
J'ai vu ce qu'ils font.
<i>Comment se déroulent vos recherches
sur Sarah Mason ?</i>
<i>Je vous envoie un agent privé
qui connaît bien cet endroit.</i>
<i>Il s'occupera
de gérer la ville au quotidien,</i>
<i>pendant que vous chercherez
le terroriste.</i>
J'essaie d'aller
au comptoir d'échange de Woodsman.
La route est fermée.
Mais c'est tout près d'ici,
c'est juste après la crête.
La route est fermée.
Vous devez repartir sur 3 km
et prendre la déviation par la route 17.
Bon sang,
mais que se passe-t-il là-bas ?
Monsieur, s'il vous plaît,
veuillez retourner à votre véhicule.
Je ne sais pas
si vous le savez déjà, mais...
un nouvel administrateur
est arrivé la nuit dernière,
un privé envoyé par <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
Il se chargera de la plupart
de mes tâches administratives.
C'est juste pour vous prévenir.
Pourquoi ?
Shérif !
Jake...
C'est sympa de passer.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
J'avais peur
que notre différend ne refasse surface.
M. Goetz m'a informé
de vos précédents désaccords.
Et a-t-il parlé du massacre que lui et
ses hommes ont provoqué à Rogue River ?
A-t-il donné le nombre exact
de personnes qu'il a tuées à New Bern ?
Ce que j'ai entendu...
c'est qu'un mandaté du gouvernement
a essayé d'entrer dans cette ville,
que vous avez ouvert le feu
et tué un de ses hommes.
- Oui, c'est ce qu'il dit !
- Major...
Puis-je lui parler ?
Je reste là.
C'est un tout nouveau bâtiment,
et c'est aussi mon nouveau bureau.
Dans un bureau, il y a une table.
Et sur cette table, il y a un dossier,
le dossier de Jake Green chez <i>J & R</i>.
Laisse-moi t'en donner un aperçu, Jake.
Tu as une période très intéressante
comme employé de <i>J & R</i>,
en particulier à Sahafa en Irak.
Tu te souviens de Sahafa ?
Tu as entendu des histoires sur moi,
tu crois savoir qui je suis.
Je me demande ce que les gens
de Sahafa doivent penser de toi ?
- Quelqu'un a appelé un flic ?
<i>- Hé, Jimmy !</i>
<i>Ça fait plaisir de te voir !</i>
On m'a dit que beaucoup d'entre vous
étaient venus me voir à l'hôpital,
sachez que j'étais sous calmants,
donc j'ai peu de souvenirs.
Mais merci et je suis désolé
pour tout ce que j'ai pu dire.
Content de vous voir sur pieds.
- Major Beck.
- Adjoint Taylor.
Vous devez être celui
qui a fait de Jake mon chef.
Oui, c'est un problème ?
Non, c'est... Peu importe...
C'est cool, c'est...
Désolé de vous imposer ça,
on essaie toujours de s'organiser.
Oh, ça ira,
je suis vraiment content de revenir.
Faites-moi juste savoir
où vous avez besoin de moi et...
je me remets tout de suite au...
Avez-vous vu cette femme ?
- On a un problème.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Beck est venu me voir aujourd'hui.
- À quel sujet ?
Jimmy est revenu au travail.
Il a vu la photo de Sarah Mason
et a dit à Beck que tu la connaissais.
D'accord.
Et qu'a-t-il dit d'autre ?
Par chance, Jimmy pense
que tu es en mission du FBI,
donc il n'a pas dit grand-chose.
Mais si Beck se renseigne sur toi
auprès du FBI, que vont-ils dire ?
Ils vont dire
qu'ils ne savent pas qui je suis.
Puis, combien de temps
avant qu'il ne vienne
et s'aperçoive que Sarah est morte
et que tu as la bombe ?
Et sa réputation se joue
sur cette mission.
Il n'abandonnera pas,
on doit prendre les enfants et partir !
- OK.
- Maintenant.
Bébé, si on part maintenant,
on n'ira pas loin.
Alors, qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
Comment puis-je vous aider ?
Je suis Robert Hawkins.
Je suis du FBI,
je ne voulais vraiment pas
qu'on démarre du mauvais pied,
mais vous détruisez mon enquête.
<i>JERICHO Saison 2 Épisode 3</i>
- Jennings & Rall -
<i>Transcript : Raceman - Forom.com

<i>- www.All-about-Subs.fr -</i>
<i>Je suis
sur cette affaire depuis des mois,</i>
et là, vous affichez des photos
de Sarah Mason partout dans la ville.
Ce n'est pas comme si
on cherchait un chat perdu, major.
J'ai croisé votre nom
avec la base de données du FBI,
il n'y a aucune trace
d'un agent Robert Hawkins.
Non, il ne doit pas y en avoir,
du moins pas dans la base de données
de Cheyenne.
Pourquoi ?
Je ne suis pas enregistré
à Cheyenne,
et je ne pense pas le faire.
Vous voyez, mes patrons
travaillent toujours à Columbus.
Ce sont eux qui m'ont envoyé
pour trouver Sarah Mason,
et quand je la trouverai,
c'est à eux que je la renverrai.
Le gouvernement de Cheyenne n'est pas
"une vue de l'esprit", M. Hawkins,
et de ce côté du fleuve, il est la loi.
Vous y faites obstruction
dans l'intérêt d'une autre nation,
ça s'appelle de la trahison.
Pour l'instant, je suis plus intéressé
par la capture d'une terroriste
que par des jeux politiques.
Et je pense que vous aussi, non ?
Et si je me fie à vos méthodes,
vous pouvez vous servir de mon aide.
Je veux
que votre femme quitte ce bureau.
Je comprends.
Alors, dites-moi ce que vous savez.
J'ai parlementé avec l'armée
toute la matinée.
Personne ne peut rien faire pour Goetz.
C'est comme s'il était
complètement au-dessus des lois.
Pas Goetz, Ravenwood...
Écoute-moi...
Ça risque de s'accélérer par ici,
il y a une chose que tu dois savoir.
Ravenwood...
est la filiale de <i>J & R</i>,
c'est leur propre armée privée.
Et tout...
tout...
ce que fait <i>J & R</i>
relève d'une autre règle de jeu.
J'ai peur de demander, mais...
comment tu le sais ?
Je t'ai dit avoir fait du transport
de marchandises à l'étranger
pendant mon absence.
Ouais, tu en as parlé.
Je travaillais pour <i>J & R</i>.
Attends, attends, écoute.
Un jour,
en Irak, on est tombés en embuscade,
deux de nos gars ont été tués.
On n'avait aucune règle d'engagement,
on a vu le village d'où ils venaient,
alors, on est...
on y est allés...
et on a commencé à tirer.
Au final,
il y a eu 6 hommes armés morts,
et 4 civils, l'un deux était
une petite fille de 12 ans.
Si je te raconte ça,
c'est parce qu'il n'y a eu
aucune répercussion, aucune.
L'armée n'avait aucune autorité
sur nous, la police non plus.
La plupart des gars
ont juste repris leur boulot,
la société...
la société voulait garder le secret...
et ce fut le cas.
Tu comprends ?
Tu comprends à qui on a affaire ?
Ces gars n'ont de comptes
à rendre à personne.
Jake...
- On n'est pas en Irak.
- Peut-être...
Peut-être,
mais les règles sont les mêmes.
Salut Dale.
T'as l'air occupé ?
D'où ça vient, tout ça ?
Missouri, Nebraska, tous
les comptoirs d'échange de la région.
- C'est quoi ?
- Les vaccins contre le virus d'Hudson.
Mais... le virus n'a pas passé
le Mississippi.
Il y a quelques jours,
je suis tombé sur un comptoir d'échange
mis en quarantaine par des militaires.
J'ai questionné la ville suivante,
ils avaient entendu dire qu'il y avait
une flambée du virus Hudson.
J'ai obtenu des vaccins
au marché noir, pas loin de là.
Il est loin, ce comptoir ?
Dans le Missouri,
à 160 km à l'ouest du Mississippi.
OK...
Je peux voir le dossier ?
Que fais-tu ici ?
Je cherche la copie
de l'autopsie d'un inconnu.
Le major Beck pense qu'il pourrait
avoir un lien avec Sarah Mason.
Tu sais que je ne parle pas de ça.
Merci.
Jimmy a parlé.
Il a dit à Beck que j'étais du FBI.
Tu sembles le prendre assez bien.
Je ne crois pas avoir le choix, Jake.
Je ne peux pas fuir.
Le seul moyen de m'en sortir...
c'est de faire face.
Alors, quel est le plan ?
Lui parler...
Je dois savoir s'il est prêt...
à entendre la vérité sur les gens
qui lui donnent ses ordres.
Et si ce n'est pas le cas ?
Alors rien de ce que je pourrai dire
n'aura d'importance,
il appellera ses supérieurs
et leur dira que je suis ici,
et quand Valente découvrira
que je suis vivant...
J'allais passer te voir, aujourd'hui.
Je dois retourner quelques jours
à Cheyenne, la semaine prochaine.
Je me demandais
si tu voudrais m'accompagner.
À Cheyenne ?
Je crois que ça te plairait beaucoup.
Qu'y a-t-il là-bas ?
Tout,
c'est en pleine expansion.
Il y avait 60 000 habitants,
mais maintenant...
ils sont presque 800 000.
Il y a plein de gens,
plein de jeunes comme toi et moi.
Je te le dis, c'est très différent.
J'ai payé pour ces fournitures,
vous ne pouvez pas les prendre.
Tu as absolument raison.
Que se passe-t-il ici ?
On a appris
qu'il y avait de la contrebande
dans le dernier convoi de M. Turner.
Je ferme les yeux pour le plus gros,
mais j'ai un salaire à justifier.
- Laissez-moi juste les médicaments.
- C'est justement le souci,
les médicaments non enregistrés peuvent
être infectés et causer une épidémie.
On va les renvoyer à Cheyenne,
où ils seront détruits.
Si Jericho a besoin de médicaments,
<i>J&R</i> en fournira.
Merci de votre aide, Shérif.
Ne t'inquiète pas, Dale,
je vais lui parler, OK ?
De plus, il n'a pas pris beaucoup.
C'est pas la quantité, c'est le contenu.
Il y a une chose que vous devez savoir.
Le virus a passé le Mississippi.
Il existe un traitement ?
Il y a un vaccin, Dale avait
quelques centaines de doses, mais...
Goetz les a confisqués.
Trois médecins
sur cette fréquence radio disent
que le risque de contagion
est quasi nul.
Mais beaucoup d'autres
affirment n'avoir qu'une seule source.
- J&R.
<i>- Allô ?</i>
<i>Allô ! Y a quelqu'un ?</i>
<i>Oui ?</i>
<i>C'est Christina, de Fall River,
Missouri.</i>
<i>Vous êtes une autre ville
en quarantaine ?</i>
Non...
Non, rien à signaler ici.
Comment allez-vous ?
<i>Pas très bien.</i>
<i>On travaille sans relâche à l'hôpital.</i>
<i>Où êtes-vous ?</i>
Dans l'ouest du Kansas.
On vient d'apprendre
pour l'épidémie dans la région.
Depuis combien de temps
le virus vous a-t-il touchés ?
<i>Il se répand très vite.</i>
<i>Les premiers cas, il y a 10 jours,</i>
<i>depuis, on a perdu 2 infirmières.</i>
Combien de personnes
sont mortes depuis ?
<i>Difficile à dire... environ... 20.</i>
Désolée, je vous reçois mal...
Vous avez dit avoir perdu
20 personnes, la semaine dernière ?
<i>Pardon, c'est 220.</i>
<i>Environ 220.</i>
Oh, mon Dieu.
<i>Écoutez, s'il y a quoi que ce soit...</i>
- Je vais aller voir <i>J&R</i>.
- Ça ne servira à rien.
On pourra peut-être
au moins faire transférer Goetz
ou trouver quelqu'un à raisonner.
Va voir Kenchy,
trouvez un moyen de vacciner
le maximum de personnes en peu de temps.
Je vais trouver un moyen
de récupérer les vaccins.
Et ça...
ça n'arrivera pas ici.
Il y a environ 3 mois,
nous avons trouvé cet inconnu
avec la nuque brisée,
enterré dans un bois vers Tookany Creek.
C'est assez évident
que c'était Sarah Mason l'assassin.
Qu'est-ce qui vous fait penser ça ?
Regardez son cou.
Un coup sec.
C'est l'œuvre d'un professionnel.
Pas d'empreintes ou de traces d'ADN ?
Eh bien, la police scientifique a été
très occupée ces derniers temps.
On a été isolés un bon moment.
Faites le test,
on verra ce que ça donne.
Tant que vous y êtes,
il y a un autre jeu d'empreintes
à analyser.
Tu pourrais
relever les empreintes, Jimmy ?
Oui, je vais essayer.
À qui sont ces empreintes ?
À Sarah Mason.
- Comment ?
- Oui, on a échangé des coups de feu.
On l'avait presque,
mais elle s'est échappée.
Elle a laissé ce couteau.
J'ai un dossier sur elle, que pourraient
nous apporter ces empreintes ?
C'est justement
ce que j'essaie de découvrir.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
Oui, Jimmy, c'est super.
Ça doit être bon signe
que tu ne sois pas encore en prison.
Le major est indécis.
Une part de lui n'est pas encore
totalement dévouée à Cheyenne.
Pourquoi crois-tu ça ?
Il n'est pas du genre
à saboter une mission.
Il est curieux,
il veut connaître la vérité.
Ceci étant dit,
je vais avoir besoin de ton aide.
Darcy étant hors jeu,
il me faut quelqu'un
pour surveiller le major.
Oui, mais ça pourrait poser problème.
Je vais faire un truc
qui pourrait me coûter mon badge.
Non !
- Non ?
- Non !
Écoute...
Tu es mon seul informateur ici.
S'il y a une chose à ne pas perdre,
c'est bien ton badge.
Que se passe-t-il, Jake ?
Je n'ai peut-être pas le choix, OK ?
- Ces empreintes ne sont pas bonnes.
- Non ?
Tiens, essaie celles-là.
Oh, oui, parfait.
Désolé, je ne veux pas être mêlé à ça.
Je ne te demanderais pas
si ce n'était pas important.
- Ce nouvel administrateur, Goetz...
- Je sais.
J'ai vu ce dont il est capable.
Je ne me dresserai pas contre lui.
C'est peut-être notre seul moyen
de protéger la ville
et on ne peut pas le faire sans toi.
OK, écoute...
Je vais te dire ce que tu dois savoir.
Écris-le, d'accord ?
Injecte le vaccin
dans une partie charnue du corps.
Ne l'inocule ni aux malades,
ni à ceux qui le seront,
ni aux allergiques aux œufs,
ça, c'est vital.
Pour les enfants de 6 mois à 2 ans,
pince la partie charnue de la cuisse
et injecte vite le vaccin,
le plus vite possible.
Tu n'as pas à vacciner tout le monde,
seulement 75-80% des personnes à risque.
Et nous parviendrons
à une bonne protection du "troupeau".
Une bonne protection
du "troupeau" ? Je...
- Une immunisation de masse, comme...
- Kenchy...
Je t'en prie...
aide-moi...
J'espère pouvoir vous aider.
C'est l'administrateur en chef qui gère
ces problèmes locaux d'habitude.
Mais c'est l'administrateur en chef
qui pose problème ici.
Je dois savoir
comment faire transférer Goetz ailleurs.
Je ne pense pas
pouvoir faire grand-chose.
Oui.
Oui, je sais, il y a pas mal de choses
qui se passent ici.
Écoutez...
Je ne discute pas le droit de <i>J&R</i>
d'installer un administrateur en chef...
- M. Green...
- Mais Goetz...
Goetz a assassiné...
des dizaines d'innocents à Rogue River,
puis à New Bern...
Et si nous ne l'avions pas fait fuir,
il nous aurait fait la même chose.
Officiellement, je répondrais
que le personnel de Ravenwood
ne peut faire son travail
que s'il est à l'abri de ce...
type de plaintes.
Mais officieusement, je pense...
que la politique de <i>J & R</i> qui vise à
protéger Ravenwood est inexcusable.
Il y a une chose dans cette entreprise
que je ne comprends pas
et que j'aimerais changer,
mais je ne peux pas...
et vous non plus.
Vous devez savoir que pour chacun
d'entre eux, il y a quelqu'un comme moi.
Et si ça peut vous réconforter...
depuis la restauration de l'ordre,
les exactions commises
par Ravenwood ont presque disparu.
Bien, merci pour votre temps.
Une dernière chose...
Juste par curiosité,
avez-vous déjà été vaccinée
contre le virus Hudson ?
Oui...
C'est le nom d'une ville du Missouri.
Elle a été infectée
par le virus du fleuve Hudson.
Les zones d'infection de cette région
sont toutes contrôlées.
Ah oui ?
Bien sûr.
Autre chose ?
Peu m'importe la version officielle
ou ce que disent les informations,
les gens de cette ville
regardent leurs proches mourir.
Ils ont besoin d'aide...
et ils ne la reçoivent pas.
<i>On dirait
que tu te réapprovisionnes vite, donc...</i>
j'imagine que les comptoirs ne sont pas
ta seule raison d'être sur la route ?
Ouais.
Dale...
En tant que shérif,
je dois te dire que...
même si les vaccins
sont transportés aujourd'hui
pour être détruits à Cheyenne,
ce serait une grosse erreur
de voler ce camion.
J'ai fait pas mal de convois pour <i>J&R</i>
et je peux te dire qu'ils sont très...
méticuleux lors de leur inventaire.
Chaque code-barres est contrôlé,
y compris
la destination à chaque arrêt.
Le seul moyen d'y arriver serait
de sortir le contenu des caisses
sans se faire prendre et de laisser
les codes-barres dans le camion.
- Tu m'as bien compris ?
- Oui.
Trish, le camion des vaccins est parti ?
Oui, il est parti
il y a environ une heure.
Je veux savoir quand ils arrivent
et quand ils sont incinérés.
Pourquoi la destruction de ces vaccins
est-elle si importante ?
Politique-maison.
Ces médicaments pourraient présenter
un danger pour la santé publique.
Et si le virus était une menace réelle,
ne devraient-ils pas...
Il n'y a pas d'infection
dans les 800 kms, donc pas de danger.
Il y a bien un danger par ici,
j'ai été vaccinée, vous aussi...
Quand il y aura une menace,
je vous le dirai.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Ce ne sont que des commandes...
Ça fait beaucoup de seringues...
Qui les a commandées ?
Le centre médical, je suppose.
Je veux que vous appeliez le chauffeur
pour lui dire
d'inspecter la marchandise.
Je veux tout savoir
sur le chargement de ce camion.
Docteur Dhuwalia...
Je me demandais pourquoi vous aviez
commandé 3000 seringues aujourd'hui.
C'est une clinique,
on a besoin de matériel.
Curieux timing, comme si pensiez
toutes les utiliser en une nuit.
Vous allez me dire ce que vous savez...
Trish et moi avons parlé de Cheyenne.
Elle m'a décrit la ville.
Cheyenne, dans le Wyoming ?
Elle dit que là-bas,
il y a des programmes d'aide,
que je devrais me renseigner.
Ils ont besoin de gens qui parlent
la langue des signes.
Alors, elle...
Elle veut que tu travailles pour <i>J&R</i> ?
Pas nécessairement <i>J & R</i>,
il y a différents programmes.
Mais ce n'est pas important,
je n'y vais pas.
Pourquoi pas ?
Parce que je vis ici.
Vous voulez vous débarrasser de moi
pour rester seuls,
eh bien, oubliez ça, je reste ici.
Tu sais, on ne veut pas
se débarrasser de toi.
Je plaisantais.
Mais...
... si tu voulais partir...
Je ne veux pas.
C'est toi qui voulais partir d'ici.
Tu devais aller à l'université
pour jouer au football.
Mais après le décès de papa et maman,
tu as laissé tomber tes études
et tu es resté pour m'élever.
Tu avais 4 ans.
Tu serais peut-être un footballeur
célèbre à l'heure actuelle...
Avant ça...
j'envisageais de revenir à la maison.
J'avais tellement peur
de te perdre, toi aussi.
Comment une si petite fille pourrait
surmonter une épreuve pareille ?
Mais tu y es parvenue.
Tu peux faire ce que tu veux, Bonnie,
tout ce que tu veux.
Tu n'as...
Tu n'as pas eu la chance
de découvrir ce que c'est...
La vie est courte...
Je veux...
je veux que tu sois heureuse.
- C'est bon ?
- Oui.
On en a 2 000 doses... sans code-barres.
Mais comment as-tu fait ça ?
Bon, on va les répartir.
On chargera les camions ici
et on les conduit aux points prévus.
Dès que c'est prêt,
on fait passer le mot dans la ville.
OK ?
Bien, soyez prudents.
Jake, où vas-tu ?
Kenchy devrait être là
depuis une demi-heure.
Comme je vous l'ai dit,
tout le matériel que j'ai commandé,
- ce n'est que du matériel...
- Que du matériel de routine, je sais.
J'ai vraiment essayé
de résoudre ça de manière civilisée,
mais vous rendez
les choses très difficiles.
Vous êtes peut-être habillé en civil,
mais vous êtes tout sauf civilisé.
Je vous connais.
Vous étiez médecin aux urgences
de l'hôpital de Rogue River.
J'ai vu ce que vous avez fait
à ces gens, je sais ce que vous êtes.
Alors, je vous le demande
une dernière fois :
où... sont les vaccins ?
D'accord.
Alors, il est temps de vous montrer...
à quel point je peux
ne pas être civilisé.
Que donnent les empreintes ?
Rien.
Elles sont classées...
"top secret".
Mason ou l'inconnu ?
Les deux.
Je vais appeler le département,
il doit y avoir une erreur.
Ce n'est pas une erreur.
Lâchez ce téléphone !
D'accord.
Mais vous ne voyez pas que vous venez
d'entrer en terrain miné ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Deux personnes, deux dossiers classés.
L'une a tué l'autre,
avec un travail de professionnel,
et a réussi à éviter d'être capturée
après des mois de chasse à l'homme.
Allons, major...
Ce n'est pas une terroriste
que vous recherchez,
mais un agent secret.
Leurs profils ne sont classés
que pour une seule raison :
leur engagement dans une agence secrète.
Je vois beaucoup de raisons valables
pour sceller
les dossiers de terroristes.
Oui, mais vos ordres
sont de tirer à vue, pas vrai ?
Mes ordres sont mes ordres.
Alors, ils veulent que vous la tuiez
avant de pouvoir découvrir
dans quoi vous êtes impliqué...
Si vous appelez vos supérieurs et
leur dites avoir le moindre soupçon,
ils vous écarteront...
ou pire...
Mettez-moi en téléconférence
avec Valente.
Demandez-lui si Sarah Mason
a déjà travaillé pour le gouvernement.
- Sortez d'ici.
- Demandez-le-lui.
Il dira peut-être "oui"
et expliquera son lien
avec votre enquête,
ou il dira "non".
S'il dit "non",
alors, comprenez que...
vous êtes au cœur
d'une conspiration gouvernementale,
qui n'hésitera pas à tout faire...
pour se protéger.
Il est à vous.
Qu'avez-vous fait ?
Un petit interrogatoire,
une question de sécurité publique.
Il est plus résistant
qu'on ne le penserait. Allons-y.
Que lui as-tu dit, Kenchy ?
- Je ne savais pas comment faire !
- Tu lui as dit quoi ?
Les vaccins, l'entrepôt !
Jake !
Prenez tout et sortez maintenant,
par cette porte.
- On a encore un camion à charger.
- Trop tard. Partez !
Si on laisse ces vaccins, on les perd.
Vite ! Je vous rejoins.
Sortez tout du camion
sans faire de bruit,
- je vais gagner du temps.
- Va avec lui.
Non, on ne peut pas les affronter,
on n'a aucune chance.
Aide-le à tout sortir. Tout !
Dale, ne m'attendez pas.
<i>Me contactez-vous pour me dire</i>
<i>que votre mission
est accomplie, major ?</i>
Non, monsieur,
mais il y a eu des progrès.
<i>Des progrès ?</i>
Dans quelques semaines, j'espère...
<i>Votre degré d'espoir
ne m'intéresse guère.</i>
<i>Si vous avez des questions, posez-les.</i>
J'essaie de comprendre
une situation complexe.
Et... je me demandais
s'il était possible...
que Sarah Mason ait déjà été employée
par le gouvernement des États-Unis.
<i>Non.</i>
<i>Vous savez tout ce qu'il faut savoir</i>
<i>pour appréhender ce terroriste,
major.</i>
<i>J'en ai assez de vos délais,
de vos échecs.</i>
<i>La prochaine fois
que vous me contacterez,</i>
<i>ce sera pour me dire
que Sarah Mason a été localisée</i>
<i>et éliminée.</i>
<i>C'est clair ?</i>
Oui, monsieur, je la trouverai.
M. Hawkins...
Alors, qu'a dit votre patron ?
J'accepte votre aide pour les recherches
sur Sarah Mason, pour l'instant.
- Et pas de politique !
- M. Hawkins...
Elle a toujours la bombe.
Je sais.
Je vous recontacterai, major.
Faut qu'on arrête de se rencontrer
comme ça, Jake.
J'imagine que tu ne sais rien sur...
une planque de vaccins volés
dans ce bâtiment, hein ?
J'ai vérifié, il n'y a rien.
Baisse ton arme.
Bien sûr...
Allons, Jake. Joue le jeu.
Allez, Jake, ce serait plus simple
de me dire où sont les médocs.
Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles.
Sonne le clairon
et dis qu'on a trouvé les vaccins.
Ils sont quelque part
dans cet entrepôt.
Compris.
Bien reçu.
Monsieur,
les vaccins ont été localisés...
- à Cheyenne.
- Quoi ?
Le bureau de <i>J & R</i>
à Cheyenne dit les avoir reçus
- et détruits.
- Comment ?
Je ne sais pas, mais les registres
indiquent que le compte est bon.
D'ici quelques jours,
on aura le reste des semences.
Et on aura fini dans quelques semaines.
Oui.
Ensuite... je crois que...
j'irai à Cheyenne avec Trish.
Oui ?
Elle m'a proposé d'y aller
une ou deux semaines,
histoire de me faire une idée.
Je pense que c'est une très bonne idée.
Tu pourrais me donner quelques secrets
pour bien m'occuper de Stanley.
Je te ferai une liste.
Je la suivrai à la lettre.
Ne t'inquiète pas,
je m'occuperai de Stanley.
Merci.
De rien.
J'ai entendu dire
que ceux de l'autre camion avaient fini.
Oui, ici aussi,
on a pratiquement terminé.
Mais...
Ils vont avoir besoin de toi.
On m'a dit ce qui s'est passé
avec Goetz.
On dirait
qu'on a eu beaucoup de chance.
Ce n'était pas de la chance.
On peut dire
ce qu'on veut de J&R,
mais ils ne font pas d'erreurs
avec les registres.
Quelqu'un de chez eux
a dû modifier le registre officiel.
Comment c'est arrivé ?
Ça, je n'en ai aucune idée.
Je crois avoir une idée.
<i>REGISTRE DE DESTRUCTION DE VACCINS
Doses reçues : 960 Correction : + 2880</i>
J'ai reçu un message radio de Christina,
de Fall River, au Missouri.
Elle dit qu'un camion
de l'armée est arrivé là-bas
avec des cartons de vaccins,
ainsi qu'un médecin qui a aidé
à administrer les médicaments.
C'est une bonne nouvelle.
Vous avez agi de votre propre chef,
à l'opposé de vos ordres.
Vous avez pris des risques
pour aider ces personnes.
- Pourquoi ?
- Vous n'êtes pas contente...
qu'elles aient été vaccinées ?
J'essaie juste de vous comprendre.
Vous êtes un militaire.
Les militaires obéissent aux ordres.
Ils ont aussi des familles.
Où ?
Ma femme était à Santa Fe
au moment des attaques.
Après ça...
Je suis désolée.
Je peux seulement espérer que...
qu'elle va bien.
Jusque là,
je continuerai à faire mon travail,
et je...
j'espère que là où elle est...
un major de l'armée...
la protège...
comme j'essaie de protéger
les personnes qui sont
sous ma responsabilité.
Merci.
Ça vient d'où ?
Du fax...
du bureau de Beck.
J'ai déjà vu ça.
Je les ai vus sortir du fax de Beck
tous les jours,
mais je les jetais.
Oui, c'est ce qu'il fallait faire.
Quand il n'y a aucun moyen
d'entrer en contact,
les membres de notre groupe ont...
un système de communication codé
que nous seuls pouvons lire.
- Ça vient de Chavez ?
- Non.
Il aurait...
il aurait appelé.
Chung alors ?
Je ne sais pas, peut-être.
On va le savoir.
Quoi ?
Tu as trouvé mon message
dans la bouteille ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je ne peux pas parler maintenant.
Mais je sais qui tu es,
je sais
ce que tu as l'intention de faire...
et je veux t'aider.

<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>
We're on government orders.
Collect food and medicine.
Same government... that ordered you
to kill those people in the hospital?
Pretty soon things are gonna start
to get back to normal.
Government will
put itself back together.
And you know who they gonna send?
Me.
<i>I wanna take it all,</i>
<i>trade it for something I can actually
use to build this store up again.</i>
Whatever I don't use, I'll put
towards supplies the town needs.
<i>I'm Major Beck,
10th Mountain Division.</i>
As of this morning,
<i>we've restored power to 70 % of town.</i>
Jericho's on the fast track to recovery.
I want you to be Jericho's sheriff.
<i>You guys heard</i>
of the Hudson River virus?
Yeah, from the news.
They stopped it at the Mississippi.
Of course they don't want a panic,
so they won't let us publish
reports that it's already
jumped the blue line.
- Blue line?
- Yes, what they call the Mississippi.
<i>Western states</i> have all
fallen in with Cheyenne.
They're strong and getting stronger.
This is our new mission:
expose Cheyenne's secret
before they take over the whole country.
I have evidence
that could expose the whole cover-up.
<i>Mimi,</i> this is Trish Merrick.
She's with <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
<i>J&R just does the day-to-day stuff:</i>
<i>help deliver supplies
and getting people back to work.</i>
<i>I've seen</i> what they do.
<i>How's your search
for Sarah Mason going?</i>
<i>I'm sending you a private contractor
who knows the area,</i>
<i>who'll take care of the day-to-day
administration of the town</i>
<i>while you find the terrorist.</i>
I'm trying to get through
to the Woodsman Trading Post.
Road's closed.
Look, I don't have far to go,
it's just over the ridge.
Road's closed.
You gonna have to go back about 2 miles,
take a detour through Route 17.
What the hell's going on out there?
Sir, please return to your vehicle.
I don't know
if you've heard yet, but...
a new administrator
arrived here last night,
a contractor provided
by <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
He'll be taking over most
of my administrative duties.
I just thought
I'd give you the heads-up.
Why?
Sheriff.
Jake...
Thanks for coming by.
What the hell is this?
I was afraid our little misunderstanding
might come up.
Mr. Goetz has already informed me
of your previous run-ins.
Did he tell you about the massacre
he and his men carried out
in Rogue River?
Did he give you a head count on
how many people he murdered in New Bern?
What I heard...
was that a sanctioned government
contractor attempted to enter this town,
and you opened fire on him,
killing one of his men.
- Yeah, that's what he told you.
- Major?
Let me have a word with Jake.
I'll be right here.
This is a brand-new building,
and this is my new office.
In that office is a desk,
and on that desk is a folder:
the <i>Jennings & Rall</i> corporate dossier
for Jake Green.
Let me try to put it
in perspective for you, Jake.
You had a very interesting period
of employment with <i>J&R</i>,
especially Saffa, Iraq.
Remember Saffa?
You've heard stories about me,
you think you know who I am.
I wonder what the people of Saffa
must think about you.
Hey, did somebody call a cop?
Hey! Jimmy!
Hey! Good to see you.
Now, I was told that many of you came
to visit me while I was in the hospital,
and let it be known,
I was heavily sedated.
Okay? So I don't remember much,
but... thank you and... I'm sorry
for anything I might have said.
Glad to see you're on your feet.
- Major Beck.
- Deputy Taylor.
You must be the one
that promoted Jake to be my boss.
Yes. Is that a problem?
No. It's... you know, I mean, whatever.
It's cool, it's...
Sorry for the imposition.
We're still getting situated.
It's great.
I'm ready to dive back in, just...
let me know
where you need me to go and I'll...
I'll get right back to...
Have you seen this woman?
Got a problem.
What's going on?
Beck came to me today.
About what?
Jimmy came back to work.
He saw the picture of Sarah Mason
and he told Beck
that you were connected to her.
Okay.
And what else did he say?
Thankfully,
Jimmy thinks you're undercover FBI,
so he didn't say much,
but if Beck asks the FBI about you,
Robert, what are they gonna say?
They're gonna say
that they got no idea who I am.
Then how long till he comes to get you?
Until he realizes that Sarah's dead
and you've got the bomb?
And his reputation is riding
on this mission. He'll never stop.
Rob, we gotta get the kids.
Baby, we gotta go. Now.
Baby, if we run now,
we won't get far.
Robert, what are we gonna do?
How can I help you?
I'm Robert Hawkins.
I'm with the FBI.
I really don't mean to start off
on the wrong foot...
but you're killing my investigation.

but now, you've been plastering
Sarah Mason's picture all over town,
I mean, it's not like it's a...
lost cat we're looking for here, Major.
I ran your name
through the FBI database.
There's no record
of an Agent Robert Hawkins.
No, there wouldn't be.
Well, not in... Cheyenne's FBI database.
Why not?
I haven't registered with Cheyenne,
and I don't think that I will.
You see,
my bosses still work in Columbus.
They're the ones
who sent me to find Sarah Mason,
and when I do find her,
they're the ones
I'm handing her over to.
The Cheyenne government
isn't a state of mind, Mr. Hawkins.
On this side of the river,
it is the law.
You obstruct it
for the benefit of another nation,
and we call that treason.
Right now, I am much more interested
in catching a terrorist
than I am in playing politics.
And I think you are, too, right?
And if your current methods
are any kind of indication,
you can use my help.
I want your wife out of this office.
I can understand that.
Now tell me what you know.
I've been pushing all morning
with the Army.
No one can do
anything about Goetz.
It's like he's completely above the law.
Goetz isn't, Ravenwood is.
Listen to me.
Things might get ugly quick around here,
so there's something you should know.
Ravenwood... is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
It's their own private army.
And anything...
anything...
that <i>Jennings & Rall</i> does
is judged by a different set of rules.
Well, I'm afraid to ask, but...
how do you know this?
Told you I had done some work overseas
hauling supplies while I was gone.
Yeah, you mentioned it.
I was working for <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
Hold on...
Hold on, listen.
One day,
in Iraq, our convoy was ambushed.
A couple of our guys were killed.
We had no rules of engagement,
and we had seen the village
they fell back to, so we just...
We just went in.
And we started shooting.
After it was done,
there were six gunmen dead,
along with four bystanders.
One of them was a 12-year-old girl.
The only reason I tell you this
is because there were no repercussions.
None.
The army had no authority over us,
the police didn't.
Most of the guys,
they just went back to their jobs.
The company...
The company wanted it quiet,
so it was.
Do you understand?
Do you understand
who we're dealing with?
These guys,
they don't answer to anybody.
Jake...
- This isn't Iraq.
- Maybe.
Maybe, but the rules are the same.
<i>Hi, Dale!</i>
Looks like somebody's been busy.
Where'd you get all this?
Here, Missouri and Nebraska.
We've been hitting
the big trading posts in the region.
What's... What's that?
That's the vaccine
for the Hudson River virus.
No, the virus ended
at the Mississippi.
A few days ago,
I came across this trading post
that was quarantined
by the military.
Now, I asked around
in the next town,
and they said that they heard
there was an outbreak of Hudson Virus.
I got vaccine from the black market,
not far from there.
How far away
was the trading post?
Missouri.
100 miles west of the Mississippi.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for
a copy of a report on a...
John Doe autopsy.
Major Beck thinks it might
be related to Sarah Mason.
I think you know
that's not what I'm talking about.
Thank you.
So, Jimmy talked.
Told Beck I was FBI.
You seem awfully calm about it.
I'm not sure
I got an alternative, Jake.
I can't run.
So the only way out of this thing...
is through it.
So, what's the plan?
I got him talking.
I just need to see
if he's willing...
... willing to hear the truth about
the people he's taking his orders from.
And if he's not?
Then nothing I say will matter.
He'll call his bosses
and he'll tell them that I'm here.
And when Valente finds out
that I'm alive...
I paid for all this stuff.
You can't just take it away.
You're absolutely right.
What's going on here?
We got word
there was some contraband
in Mr. Turner's most recent shipment.
I'll look the other way for most of it,
but I got a paycheck to justify.
- Can you just leave the meds?
- The meds are the biggest problem.
Unregistered pharmaceuticals
could be tainted
and even cause an outbreak.
This'll all be shipped
back to Cheyenne to be disposed of.
If Jericho needs meds,
<i>J&R</i> will issue a safe supply.
Thanks for your help, Sheriff.
Don't worry about it, Dale.
I'll talk to him, all right? Besides,
it doesn't look like he took that much.
It's not how much he took,
it's what he took.
There's something you guys
need to hear.
The virus jumped the Mississippi.
Can it be treated?
There's a vaccine, which Dale managed
to find a few thousand doses of, but...
Goetz confiscated it.
Three doctors on this radio frequency
said the risk of the generic stuff
being dangerous is almost nil,
but somehow there's only one
legally approved source.
<i>J&R</i>.
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Hello, is anyone there?</i>
Hello?
<i>This is Christina in Fall River,
Missouri.</i>
<i>Is this another quarantined town?</i>
No.
No, we're clear.
How are you?
<i>Not too good.</i>
<i>I've been working
around the clock at the hospital.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>
We're in western Kansas.
We're just hearing
about the outbreaks in your area.
How long has it been
since the virus hit?
<i>It's moving really fast.</i>
<i>I think...
the first cases ten days ago,</i>
<i>but now we're down two nurses.</i>
How many people have
you lost since then?
<i>Hard to say... a-about...</i>
<i>20.</i>
I'm sorry. You're breaking up.
It sounds like you've lost
20 people in the last week?
<i>Sorry, 220.</i>
<i>Around 220.</i>
Oh, my God.
I'm going to <i>J&R</i>.
It's not gonna do any good.
Maybe we can at least
have Goetz transferred,
find someone we can reason with.
Go find Kenchy.
Work out a way of inoculating
as many people as possible,
as fast as possible.
I'll figure out a way
to get the vaccines back.
That...
... that's not gonna happen here.
About three month ago,
we found this John Doe, broken neck,
buried out in the woods
near Tookany Creek.
Wasn't hard to figure out
that Sarah Mason was probably the perp.
What makes you think that?
Well, look at his neck.
It's snapped clean.
Whoever did that knew
what they were doing.
Did you run prints? DNA?
Well, the...
CSI department's been a little...
busy lately.
We've been offline for a while.
All right, run it.
See what it turns up.
You know, when you do,
there are another set of prints
you should run as well.
Think you can lift a set
from that, Jimmy?
Sure, I'll give it a shot.
Okay.
Whose prints are those?
Sarah Mason's.
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, we exchanged fire,
almost had her cornered,
but then she slipped away.
Left that clip behind.
I've already been given dossier on her.
What more can her prints tell me?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
There. How's that?
Yeah, Jimmy, that's fine.
Should I take it as a good sign
you're not in jail yet?
The major is conflicted.
There's still a part of him that's not
completely signed up to Cheyenne yet.
What makes you think that?
Well, he's not a guy
trying to wrap up a mission.
He's curious.
He wants to know the truth.
That said,
I'm gonna need your help.
Now that Darcy's out of play, I need
somebody else to keep tabs on the major.
Yeah, we may have a problem
with that.
I'm about to do something
that might cost me my badge.
No.
- No?
- No.
Look...
you are my only eyes
and ears in this place.
If nothing else, that badge
is one thing we cannot lose.
What's going on with you, Jake?
Look, I may not have a choice.
All right?
Those prints weren't good enough.
- No?
- No.
Here,
let's try these.
Oh, yeah, that's better.
I'm sorry.
I can't get involved
in any of this.
I wouldn't ask you
if we weren't in trouble.
- This new administrator Goetz, he's...
- I know.
I have seen what he is capable of.
And I will not go against him.
This might be our only chance
to protect this town
and we can't do it without you.
All right, look,
I will tell you
what you need to know.
You write it down, okay?
You administer the vaccines
in a fleshy part of the body, okay?
No one who is ill,
no one who is getting ill,
no one with egg allergies,
that's very important.
Now, children six months to two years,
pinch the fleshy part of the thigh,
administer the vaccine quickly,
the quicker the better.
Now, we don't need to get everybody,
just 75 to 80 % of high risks
and then we've achieved
herd immunity.
"Herd immunity", I... I...
Yes, herd immunity,
it's like when...
Kenchy.
Please,
help me with this.
I hope I can help you.
Usually the chief administrator
handles the issues with...
local leadership.
The chief administrator
is the issue here.
I need to know how to have Goetz
transferred out of here.
I... I don't think that
I can do anything about that.
Yeah, I know, there's a lot of that
going on around here.
Look...
I'm not disputing <i>J&R</i>'s authority
- to have a chief administrator.
- Mr. Green...
But Goetz, Goetz murdered...
dozens of innocent people
in Rogue River and then in New Bern,
and if we hadn't fought him
off here,
- he would have done the same to us.
- Officially,
officially, my answer is that Ravenwood
personnel can only do their jobs
if they're insulated from these
kinds of complaints.
But unofficially,
my answer is
that the <i>J&R</i> policy
that protects Ravenwood is inexcusable.
It's one thing about this company
that I don't understand
and I wish I could change, but I can't.
And neither can you.
You need to know that for every
one of them, there is one of me.
And if it's any consolation,
since the end of the lawlessness,
the reports of Ravenwood
violence have almost disappeared.
All right,
well, thank you for your time.
One last thing.
I'm just curious.
Have you been inoculated
for the Hudson River Virus yet?
Yeah.
It's the name of a town in Missouri.
They've been hit bad
by the Hudson River Virus.
The isolated outbreaks in this area
are all being handled.
Are they?
Yes, they are.
Is there something else?
I don't care what the official story is
or what the news is reporting.
People in that town
are watching their families die.
They need help,
and they're not getting it.
It looks like
you're restocking pretty fast, so...
I'm assuming visiting trading posts
isn't all you've been up
to out on the roads?
Yeah.
Dale,
as Sheriff,
it's my job to tell you that...
even though the vaccines
are heading out on a <i>J&R</i> transport
today to be destroyed in Cheyenne,
it'd be a big mistake
to hijack that truck.
I used to haul supplies for <i>J&R</i>
and let me tell you, they are very
meticulous about inventory.
Every bar code that leaves at origin
is tracked at destination
or all hell breaks loose.
The only way someone could do it would
be to remove the contents of the boxes
without being detected and leave
the bar-coded containers in the truck.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.
Trish, is the transport
with the vaccine on the road?
Yeah, it left on schedule
about an hour ago.
I wanna know when it arrives and then,
let me know when it's been incinerated.
Why is it so important
that the vaccine be destroyed?
It's policy.
Unregistered meds
could pose a danger to public safety.
What if the virus
really is a threat to these people?
Shouldn't they a chance?
There hasn't outbreak within
500 miles, there's no threat.
Clearly there is some
form of threat out there.
I was inoculated, you were inoculated.
When there is a threat,
I will let you know.
What's this?
Purchase orders.
That's a lot of syringes.
Who ordered this?
The medical center, I assume.
I want you to call the driver
of the transport,
have him pull over
and visually inspect the cargo.
I wanna know
everything that's on that truck.
Dr. Dhuwalia.
I am wondering
why you ordered 3 000 syringes today.
This is a clinic and I need supplies.
That's curious timing, it's almost
as if you planned to run out overnight.
I'd like you to tell me what you know.
Cheyenne, Wyoming?
So she wants you to work for <i>J&R</i>?
Why not?
I was so afraid
I was going to lose you, too.
How could such a little girl
survive such a terrible crash?
But you did.
You can do anything
you wanna do, Bonnie.
Anything.
You just...
you haven't had the chance
to figure out what that is yet.
Life's short.
I want you...
I want you to be happy.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nice job.
A couple thousand doses. Unboxed.
How did you pull this off?
All right, let's get it divided up.
We'll load the trucks from here and get
them off to the designated locations
As soon as they're ready, we'll give the
go-ahead to spread the word around town.
Got it?
All right, be careful.
Jake, where you going?
Kenchy was supposed
to be here 30 minutes ago.
As I've told you,
any of the supplies
I ordered are a completely routine...
... "Completely routine matter", I know.
I'm really trying to resolve this...
in a civilized manner,
but you're making that very difficult.
You may be wearing civilian clothes,
but you're anything but civilized.
I know you.
The hospital in Rogue River.
You were the ER doc.
I saw what you did to those people.
I know what you are.
All right,
I am gonna ask you one last time.
Where...
are the vaccines?
Okay...
Now let's talk about how...
uncivilized I can be.
What did the prints turn up?
Nothing.
Came back classified.
Top secret.
Mason or John Doe?
Both.
I'm gonna call DHS.
Must be some sort of mistake.
It is not a mistake.
Get your hand off the phone.
Okay.
But don't you realize that
you just stepped on a land mine?
What are you talking about?
Two subjects,
both with classified profiles.
One killed the other
and it's a professional hit,
and she has avoided capture
for months despite a full-scale manhunt.
Come on, Major.
You're not hunting a terrorist.
You're hunting a spook.
You see those profiles?
They would not be locked
for any reason other than
former involvement with a covert agency.
There are plenty of valid reasons...
for a terrorist's file to be sealed.
Yes, but your orders are
to kill on sight, aren't they?
My orders are my orders.
Well, they want you to find her
and kill her
before you figure out
what it is you're involved in.
You call your bosses and you tell them
that you are even onto a scent of it,
and they will remove
you from the situation.
Or worse.
Get me Valente on the conference, now!
Ask him if Sarah Mason
ever worked for the government.
- Step out.
- You just ask him.
Because he will either say yes,
and explain her involvement
at your investigation,
or he will say no.
If he says no,
then understand,
you have just stumbled
into a government conspiracy
that will stop at nothing
to protect itself.
He's all yours.
What did you do?
A little Q&A,
matter of corporate security.
He's tougher than he looks.
Let's go.
- What did you tell him, Kenchy?
- I didn't know what else to do.
- What did you tell him?
- The vaccines. The warehouse.
Jake...
Get everything and get out now.
Go out that door.
We have one more truck to load.
Look, there's no time. Go!
If we leave these meds,
we will lose them.
Go. Out now.
All right, get all the stuff
out to the truck.
Don't make a sound.
I'll buy us some time.
- Go with him.
- No, we can't fight this out.
We don't stand a chance. You help them
get everything out of here. Everything.
Dale, don't wait on me.
<i>Are you contacting me to tell me</i>
<i>you've accomplished your mission, Major?</i>
No, sir.
But there has been progress.
<i>Progress.</i>
Yes, we're hopeful
that within a few weeks...
<i>I'm not interested in hearing
about how hopeful you are.</i>
<i>If you have questions, ask them.</i>
I'm trying to make sense
of some difficult intel.
And... I'm asking if it's possible...
Sarah Mason has ever been
in the employ of the U.S. government.
<i>No. She hasn't.</i>
You know everything you need to know
<i>in order to apprehend this terrorist,
Major.</i>
<i>I'm tired of your delays.
I'm tired of your failures.</i>
<i>The next time you contact me,</i>
<i>I want to hear
that Sarah Mason has been located...</i>
<i>and eliminated.</i>
<i>Is that clear?</i>
Yes, sir. I will find her.
Mr. Hawkins.
So what did you boss say?
I accept your offer to assist
my search for Sarah Mason. For now.
Okay.
And no politics.
Mr. Hawkins,
she still has the bomb.
I know.
I'll be in touch, Major.
We've got to stop
meeting like this, Jake.
You wouldn't happen
to know anything about a...
stash of stolen vaccine
in this building, would you?
I checked. It's clear.
Put it down.
I'm sure it is.
Come on, Jake... let's play ball.
Come on, Jake.
It would go whole lot easier for you
if you just tell me where the meds are.
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
Get on the horn!
Tell them we found the vaccine.
It's somewhere inside this warehouse.
Roger that.
Copy that.
Sir, the vaccines have been located.
In Cheyenne.
What?
The <i>J&R</i> office in Cheyenne
says it's been delivered
and destroyed.
How?
I don't know, sir, but the books are
saying that the load is accounted for.
... bring the rest of the seed
in a few days.
And then get the rest
done in a week or so.
Yeah.
Then,
I think...
I'm gonna head to Cheyenne with Trish.
Yeah?
Just for a week or two,
to check things out.
I think that's a really good idea.
Maybe you can give me some pointers
on how to take care of Stanley.
I'll make a list.
And I'll follow it to the letter.
Don't worry.
I'll take care of Stanley.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I just heard from the truck
over by Gimbel Field, they're done.
We should be done here shortly.
Yeah, but...
They're gonna need you.
I heard what happened with Goetz.
It sounds like we got awfully lucky.
It wasn't luck.
Say what you want about <i>J&R</i>, but they
don't make mistakes with their books.
Someone on the inside changed
the disposal facility log.
How that happened...
I have no idea.
I think I have an idea.
I got a radio call from Christina
from Fall River, Missouri.
She said that an Army Humvee
arrived in her town
with boxes of the vaccine,
and a medical Officer
to help administer the drugs.
That's good news.
You went outside your chain of command.
You put yourself at risk
to help those people.
Why?
Are you upset
that they received the inoculations?
I'm just trying to understand you.
You're a military man.
Military men follow orders.
We also have families.
Where?
My wife was in Santa Fe
when the attacks came.
After that...
I'm sorry.
I have to hope that...
she's okay.
Until then, I do my job.
And I...
I trust that wherever she is...
some Army Major...
is looking after her,
the way I try to look after the people
under my charge.
Thank you.
Where did that come from?
The fax in...
... in Beck's office.
You know, I've seen that before.
It's been coming
through Beck's fax machine for days,
but I just been throwing them away.
Yeah, that's what
you were supposed to do.
If there was no other way
to reach each other,
the members of my team had...
method of communicating in the open
so that no one could read it but us.
- Is it from Chavez?
- No.
He would...
he would just call.
Then Chung?
I don't know. Maybe.
Let's find out.
What?
<i>You found my message in a bottle.</i>
Who is this?
<i>I can't talk now.</i>
<i>But I know who you are.</i>
<i>I know what you're trying to do,</i>

<i>Précédemment dans Jericho...</i>
<i>Je suis le Major Beck,</i>

Je voudrais que vous fassiez la liaison

<i>Comment se déroulent vos recherches
sur Sarah Mason ?</i>
<i>Je vous envoie un privé

<i>Salut, Dale !</i>
D'oů ça vient, tout ça ?
Missouri, Nebraska... Tous
les comptoirs d'échange de la région.
<i>Qu'y a-t-il ?</i>
On a appris
qu'il y avait de la contrebande
dans le dernier convoi de M. Turner.
On va les renvoyer ŕ Cheyenne,
oů ils seront détruits.
<i>Tous les États de l'ouest</i>
sont alliés ŕ Cheyenne.
Ils sont forts
et le sont de plus en plus.
Notre nouvelle mission :
révéler le secret de Cheyenne
<i>avant qu'ils ne contrôlent tout le pays.</i>
J'ai la preuve qui peut
faire tomber toute leur couverture.
J'ai une des bombes.
Mimi, voici Trish Merrick,
de <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
<i>Je suis impatiente
de retourner au bureau.</i>
Tu ne reviendrais pas de l'organisation
des gens de <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
Je crois...
que je vais aller
ŕ Cheyenne avec Trish.
Ah oui ?
Sarah Mason a-t-elle déjŕ été employée
par le gouvernement des États-Unis ?
<i>Non, pas du tout.</i>
J'accepte votre aide
pour les recherches de Sarah Mason.
<i>Que faites-vous sur ma propriété ?</i>
Les gars, c'est bon.
Stanley...
Désolé pour tout ça,
on répare juste un pneu et on s'en va.
Dale, mais qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Tu sais... J'importe.
Tu importes ŕ 4 heures du matin ?
Tiens...
Pour fermer les yeux.
Stanley m'a demandé
de te redonner ça.
Trouve un autre chemin.
Arręte de passer chez lui.
- C'est plus sűr.
- C'est pas une suggestion.
C'est déjŕ dur

Vous faites quoi ?
C'est pour prévenir que votre commerce

"Enregistré" ?
Simple précaution.
Il y a toujours
beaucoup de pillages sur les routes.
Le gouvernement veut que les commerçants
prouvent ne pas acheter aux truands.
Vous devriez questionner le shérif sur
les vols et la corruption qui sévissent.
Il doit ętre au courant.

{pos(192,235)}Nous ne parlons pas de révolution.
{pos(192,235)}On a un problčme ŕ résoudre,
alors, faisons-le,
avant que ça soit incontrôlable.
- Non, c'est <i>J&R</i> qui est incontrôlable.
- S'il te plaît, Fred, relax.
Il nous faut une alternative.
{pos(192,235)}On doit trouver un moyen de faire
du commerce, hors de contrôle de <i>J&R</i>.
{pos(192,235)}Dale a les relations et les camions.
{pos(192,235)}Stanley...
Il nous faut ta ferme.
{pos(88,218)}Pourquoi moi ?
{pos(88,220)}Il y a les points de contrôle
de l'armée partout.
{pos(88,220)}Ta ferme est l'accčs
le plus sűr ŕ la ville.
Ma ferme sera ŕ nouveau fonctionnelle
dans une semaine.
{pos(98,220)}J'ai besoin de l'appui de <i>J&R</i>,
tu comprends ?
{pos(98,220)}Donc tu nous laisses
pour traiter seul avec eux ?
Allons, les amis,
on n'est pas dans <i>Red Dawn</i>*.
Ils m'ont redonné ma ferme,
ils ont effacé ma dette,
on a ŕ nouveau l'électricité,
le boulot, la nourriture.
Ils sont lŕ pour nous aider,
vous ne voyez pas ?
Comment ?
En prenant possession de tout ?
{pos(192,220)}Que nous est-il arrivé ?
Le prix de l'essence était
déjŕ élevé avant la bombe.
Les politiciens étaient malhonnętes,
les entreprises aussi.
Mais on ne traitait pas
avec les truands, si ?
Les truands ?
Sans ce truand,
{pos(192,220)}tu ne serais pas vacciné
contre le virus d'Hudson.
{pos(192,220)}Désolé, Jake.
Ne comptez pas sur moi.
Stanley ?
{pos(192,220)}Vous voulez bien vous calmer ?
Calmez-vous un instant, d'accord ?
{pos(192,220)}On fait quoi maintenant ?
{pos(192,220)}On va vous trouver un autre moyen
d'accéder ŕ la ville.
{pos(192,204)}Ça va aller.
{pos(192,220)}Salut.
{pos(192,220)}Tu pars ?
{pos(192,220)}Demain matin, le major Beck
va recevoir un rapport
{pos(192,190)}provenant d'une unité de reconnaissance
de l'Air Force basée ŕ Cheyenne.
{pos(192,220)}Il contiendra un scan aérien
des radiations de toute la zone.
La bombe...
Je croyais que le plomb
la rendait indétectable.
{pos(192,220)}C'est un systčme trčs avancé.
{pos(192,220)} Le plomb ne suffit pas.
Alors, on doit la déplacer.
Le scan rapprochera Beck,
mais pas jusqu'au but.
Tu vois,
tout ce qui a une masse atomique élevée
se présentera comme du plutonium.
Il devra encore aller vérifier
chaque localisation, une par une.
Cette cabane sera
une de ces localisations.
Comment sais-tu tout ça ?
Seule une copie papier
aura été envoyée.
Ils ne vont pas risquer
de passer par internet.
Ce rapport sera dans le bureau de Beck
avec ses dossiers confidentiels.
Il me faut la page du rapport
qui identifiera la bombe...
C'est ŕ moi de le faire, j'imagine.
Dans les 24 heures, Jake,
48 au plus tard,
avant qu'ils puissent traiter les infos
et analyser les localisations.
Tu as un plan
pour faire sortir Beck de son bureau ?
Pour ętre clair...
Oui.
- Tu as l'essence ?
- Oui, elle est vers l'auto.
Oů vas-tu ?
J'ai une maison ŕ incendier.
<i>Si vous ętes lŕ pour vous enregistrer,
mettez-vous dans la file.</i>
<i>Pour changer de l'argent,</i>
<i>merci de préparer
vos deux pičces d'identité.</i>
Je croyais que vous faisiez
la compta chez vous aujourd'hui.
J'ai terminé.
Je suis si contente de vous avoir
parmi nous, vous n'imaginez pas.
Ne parlez pas trop vite.
J'ai trouvé une chose bizarre,
alors, je voulais vérifier mon registre
avec ceux de <i>J&R</i>.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Les dépenses que vous m'avez listées
correspondent bien,
jusqu'ŕ l'arrivée
de la nouvelle monnaie.
Alors, soudainement,
on a un écart de 10 000 dollars.
Il ne doit s'agir
que d'une erreur comptable.
Peut-ętre que <i>J&R</i>
n'a pas délivré tant de nouvelle monnaie
que ce que dit le registre.
<i>J&R</i> est méticuleuse sur la comptabilité.
Ils ne feraient pas une telle erreur.
Alors, quelqu'un les a pris.
Comment ?
Elle a été sortie du camion blindé,
examinée chez <i>J&R</i>,
puis, sous protection armée sans cesse.
Je crois qu'il va vous falloir
découvrir qui y a eu accčs.
Vous savez quoi ? Ne vous en faites pas,
ce n'est certainement qu'une erreur.
Je m'en occupe.
C'est Fort Knox ici.
C'est quoi ?
Un scanner ŕ empreinte digitale,
ils préparent cette salle pour y mettre
ŕ l'abri des infos confidentielles.
Seules quelques personnes
y auront accčs.
Laisse-moi deviner,
je n'en fais pas partie ?
Mais... si ça peut te consoler,
tu as maintenant l'honneur
d'ętre le premier...
shérif de Jericho de l'histoire...
ŕ ne pas avoir la clé
du bureau du shérif.
Qui y a accčs ?
Seulement les officiers...
Il y a une liste qui traîne par ici.
Ouais.
Voilŕ.
Dites au Lieutenant
que... les données sont arrivées.
Je veux voir ça le plus vite possible.
Alors, combien de violations
du couvre-feu avons-nous ?
Douze sur la ville
de New Bern depuis mardi.
C'est ŕ peu prčs ce qu'on pensait.
Oui, ce n'est pas le nombre
qui m'inquičte...
Britt Daniels, Randy Pope...
Ces six hommes travaillaient ŕ l'usine
de munitions quand j'étais lŕ-bas.
Les choses deviennent tendues, non ?
Violence gratuite, désaccords
avec les représentants de<i>J&R</i>...
Oui.
J'ai peur qu'il ne s'agisse pas
de simples violations de couvre-feu.
Ça me semble plus organisé.
Ils testent les limites.
On va surveiller ça.
Heather...
Merci.
<i>RAPPORT SUR LES RADIATIONS AÉRIENNES</i>
Oublions, il est trop nerveux.
Callahan espčre une promotion,
il ne risquera pas ça.
Foster est bęte comme ses pieds,
comptez-le en "peut-ętre".
Comment tu sais tout ça ?
Les soldats qui tiennent
ces points de contrôle traînent au bar.
Me faire des amis, c'est mon boulot.
Skylar dit que vous voulez me voir.
Ouais.
Tu...
passais bien par le terrain de Stanley
pour éviter les contrôles ?
Ouais.
Et si tu n'avais pas
ŕ les éviter...
Si tu pouvais passer juste devant eux...
On m'a dit que vous aviez des infos
sur les personnes qui font entrer
en fraude des biens volés.
Avant de dire quoi que ce soit,
je veux entendre
que je pourrai garder mon affaire.
J'ai une famille ŕ faire vivre.
Eh bien, Fred,
je suis sűr qu'on peut s'arranger.
Le gamin...
Dale Turner.
Il est la clé de tout ça.
Quoi ?
Je ne peux pas l'avoir.
Je ne peux pas avoir le rapport.
Que veux-tu dire ?
Je veux dire
qu'ŕ moins de couper un pouce,
je ne pourrai pas entrer
dans le bureau de Beck.
Le plan est lancé, Jake.
Les choses changent,
alors, tu dois t'adapter.
Il y a bien quelqu'un...
Beck lui fait confiance, c'est elle qui
lui rapporte la situation de New Bern.
Elle peut s'approcher du rapport...
sans crainte,
mais elle est intelligente.
D'accord ? Il va falloir lui dire.
Lui dire quoi ?
Lui dire pourquoi il nous faut la page.
Tu recommences...
Ŕ chaque obstacle,
ta réponse est de mettre
quelqu'un dans le coup.
- Tu peux lui faire confiance.
- Tu as déjŕ dit ça pour le journaliste.
Tu crois que je l'ignore ?
- Je me soucie de cette personne.
- Pas moi.
Et tu vois ça ?
Ce n'est pas un club secret oů on invite
des gens quand ça nous arrange.
Pourquoi tu ne me dis pas quoi faire ?
Dis-le-moi !
8 personnes ont accčs ŕ cette pičce
et 7 d'entre elles sont des militaires.
Alors, si tu veux y entrer dans les
prochaines 24 heures, montre-moi !
Montre-moi comment !
Bon,
j'ai été patiente jusque-lŕ, mais...
maintenant,
tu m'expliques ce qu'on fait lŕ ?
Ouais.
<i>- Elle est lŕ ?</i>
- Oui.
Je vais te demander
ton aide aujourd'hui.
Ça implique que je te donne
une information trčs dangereuse.
Seules 5 personnes
en dehors des gens de Cheyenne
savent ce que je vais te dire.
Et certaines sont prętes ŕ tuer
pour empęcher que ça soit rendu public.
Pourquoi j'accepterais ?
Tu as déjŕ mis ta vie en jeu
pour la ville,
et la derničre chose que je désire,
c'est te demander de le refaire, mais...
je sais que si tu comprends l'enjeu,
tu voudras nous aider.
Quel enjeu ?
Je pense que c'est l'avenir
de notre pays.
Heather...
Tu veux entendre la suite ?
J'écoute.
{pos(192,220)}Tu devrais commencer ŕ réfléchir
ŕ quel programme tu aimerais et oů.
{pos(192,220)}Tu voulais me voir, Trish ?
Oui, je voulais vous parler
d'un problčme comptable.
Un truc de travail, c'est ennuyant.
Je ne crois pas vous connaître.
Bonnie Richmond.
Je te présente John Goetz.
C'est notre administrateur.
Pour quoi as-tu besoin de moi ?
Je me suis aperçue que, depuis la mise
en place de la nouvelle monnaie,
de l'argent a disparu.
Vraiment ? Combien ?
10 000 dollars.
Voilŕ mon rapport, vous pouvez donc
commencer une enquęte.
Oů as-tu obtenu cette information
exactement ?
La comptable
que nous avons embauchée ici.
- Elle a trouvé cet écart.
- Elle a pu faire une erreur.
Parfois, une recrue locale
n'a pas une vision globale.
Elle tient une compta, en parallčle,
donc elle peut comparer
avec celle de <i>J&R</i>.
Elle pense que les registres de <i>J&R</i>
ont été retouchés.
Je vois.
Écoutez, vous et moi,
nous savons tous deux
quelle vigilance <i>J&R</i> demande ŕ ce sujet.
Tolérance zéro.
Pour la sécurité de nos deux jobs,
je crois qu'il est crucial
qu'on s'occupe de ça correctement.
Tu as absolument raison.
Merci de m'avoir signalé ça.
Je vais m'en occuper tout de suite.
Et voilŕ pour toi, Timmy.
Merci, madame.
Tu as reçu un mot de Jane ?
Non.
Ce bataillon, c'est la poisse
pour recevoir du courrier de l'est.
Ils disent que c'est un risque
pour la sécurité.
Merci de vous en soucier.
Tu dois terriblement lui manquer.
Ne vous en faites pas, dčs que j'aurai
une perm, elle en aura assez de moi.
Comment vont les affaires ?
C'est dur de garder les rayons pleins
avec vous tous ici.
Mettez-moi un bourbon de côté
pour plus tard, alors.
D'accord, j'essaierai.
Je suis presque ŕ court.
Tu seras au point de contrôle ce soir ?
Oui, madame.
Parce que je pourrais
passer un coup de fil,
tu pourrais peut-ętre regarder ailleurs,
juste pour un camion.
Vous me demandez de commettre un délit.
Juste un peu d'alcool...
Juste un peu d'alcool ?
Oui, d'accord.
Ça marche.
Merci, Timmy.
C'est pas ton jour de chance, gamin.
Le gouvernement,
l'armée, les journalistes,
tous mentent ŕ propos
des responsables des attaques ?
Oui.
Mais vous, vous dites la vérité ?
Oui.
Qui ętes-vous ?
OK.
OK, OK, d'accord.
- Que voulez-vous que je fasse ?
- Bon...
Il y a un rapport
dans le bureau de Beck.
On a besoin que tu en retires une page.
- Beck est impliqué lŕ-dedans ?
- Pas directement, non.
- Beck est quelqu'un de bien.
- Oui, c'est vrai,
mais il reçoit ses ordres
de gars dangereux ŕ Cheyenne.
Il y a quoi dans ce rapport ?
Des données de relevés aériens
de radiations.
De radiations ?
Des radiations ?
C'est quoi cette histoire ?
Tu me fais confiance ?
Tu me fais confiance ?
- Oui.
- Bon.
Ça doit se faire aujourd'hui.
Hawkins fera sortir Beck de son bureau.
Je suis désolé de t'embarquer lŕ-dedans.
Il n'y a pas d'autre moyen.
D'accord.
M. Hawkins.
- Merci, Lieutenant.
- Oui, Monsieur.
Je me demandais
quand j'aurais de vos nouvelles.
En combien de temps pouvez-vous envoyer
des hommes au Nebraska ?
Pourquoi ? Qu'y a-t-il au Nebraska ?
J'ai un indic,
qui fait partie d'une bande
qui opčre le long de la route I-80.
Il vient de confirmer
l'identification visuelle
de Sarah Mason.
En train de faire quoi ?
Elle a été repérée
dans une ferme isolée.
C'est probablement une planque.
- L'information est fiable ?
- Major,
Mason ne reste jamais au męme endroit
bien longtemps.
Alors, on peut y aller ?
- Lieutenant.
- Monsieur.
J'ai besoin d'une patrouille.
Prévenez le camp Liberty par radio,
je veux deux Apaches pręts ŕ décoller.
Bien reçu.
La Californie ?
J'attends au moins une carte postale
par semaine, OK ?
De préférence
avec des filles en bikinis.
Et si elles sont nues,
{pos(192,240)}- c'est encore mieux.
<i>- Ne te rends pas malade.</i>
{pos(192,240)}Oů emmčnent-ils Dale ?
Ils ont dű l'attraper
faisant de la contrebande.
{pos(192,240)}Ils ne sont pas de la police...
{pos(192,240)}Oů est Jake ?
Il n'est pas ici. Allons-y.
Regardez encore, Capitaine,
on doit en ętre sűrs.
Terminé.
Major,
du nouveau ?
Aucune trace de Mason, on a
des hélicos qui survolent tout l'État.
Monsieur, c'est un incendie criminel.
On a aussi trouvé des douilles
de deux armes différentes.
- Il y a eu une fusillade.
- Et le corps que vous avez trouvé ?
Carbonisé, mais d'aprčs
la structure osseuse, c'est un homme.
- L'échantillon d'ADN va ętre analysé.
- Encore une impasse, j'en suis sűr.
Le feu a fait fondre
le matériel informatique de la maison.
Mais on a trouvé ça
derričre le mur de la cave,
une sorte de disque dur.
On doit pouvoir le récupérer.
Que pensez-vous de tout ça ?
Je pense que Mason est venue ici
pour finir le travail.
Je pense que le feu était censé
faire tout disparaître et...
je pense qu'elle a raté quelque chose.
Je veux voir ce qu'il contient.
Apportez-le aux techniciens.
Oui, Monsieur.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Nous voulons voir Dale Turner.
Sortez-le de lŕ.
Je ne peux pas, shérif.
Ce n'est pas une prison
et vous ne pouvez y retenir les gens.
Si Dale est accusé de délit,
le bureau du shérif enquętera.
Ce ne sera pas nécessaire.
Un camion plein de contrebande
est une preuve suffisante pour moi.
Vous ne pourrez le garder ici toujours.
C'est vrai. Je l'ai livré
ŕ la police militaire il y a 10 minutes.
Il est en route pour la prison de
Loomer Ridge pendant que nous parlons.
Vous l'avez envoyé en prison ?
Ce gamin est coupable.
Je représente l'autorité.
Je fais passer un message.
Il n'y a pas de place
pour les voleurs ŕ Jericho.
S'il nous emprisonne quand il veut,
pourquoi ça s'arręterait avec Dale ?
Les vaccins, les inscriptions,
la fraude, et maintenant ça...
Nous perdons cette ville.
On doit les rattraper.
Ils ont dix minutes d'avance.
Ŕ suivre le camion,
on risque de se faire tirer dessus.
Sűrement. Va voir Beck.
Il faut que tu lui passes un message.
Il va dire
qu'il n'a pas l'autorité pour agir.
Nous allons la lui donner.
Repos. Que se passe-t-il ?
Monsieur, j'ai trouvé cette femme
dans votre bureau.
Elle a l'autorisation d'y ętre.
Quel est le problčme ?
Je crois qu'elle se connectait
ŕ des informations sécurisées,
en dehors de son domaine de compétence.
Regardiez-vous autre chose
que les fichiers concernant New Bern ?
Pas du tout.
J'avais besoin de vérifier
quelque chose dans votre boîte mail.
Problčme résolu.
Merci pour votre aide, Sergent.
Monsieur, sauf votre respect,
je ne crois pas qu'elle dise la vérité.
Eh bien, moi si.
Vous remettez en cause mon jugement ?
Non, Monsieur.
Vous pouvez disposer.
Oui, Monsieur.
Merci.
Merci ?
Toutes mes excuses...
J'espčre que l'attitude du sergent
n'a pas ébranlé votre confiance.
Ce serait un crime.
Laissez-moi parler.
Gardez vos mains en l'air.
- Tirez-vous.
- Eh bien...
Ça doit ętre une erreur.
Je suis le shérif,
ce gamin devrait ętre sous ma garde.
Barrez-vous ou je tire.
- J'ai des ordres du major Beck !
- C'est notre dernier avertissement.
Appelez le major Beck, 10e div...
- Je ne reçois pas mes ordres de lŕ.
- Appelez-le. Il vous expliquera.
Tirez-vous ou j'ouvre le feu.
Monsieur.
Un major du quartier général en ligne.
Pardon ?
Oui, Monsieur, il est lŕ.
Oui, Monsieur.
Il veut vous parler.
Major ?
<i>Ça vous dérangerait
de me dire ce que vous foutez ?</i>
J'ai besoin de votre aide.
Votre frčre m'a dit que vous vouliez
identifier un gamin de 16 ans
sans aucun intéręt
comme informateur sur le terrorisme.
Mais si c'est un élément
de votre enquęte,
alors,
Goetz perd toute autorité sur lui.
- Vous avez perdu l'esprit ?
- C'est un gosse.
Il a 16 ans et Goetz l'envoie en prison
sans juge, sans procčs, sans rien.
C'est une erreur.
Et vous avez les moyens d'y remédier,
donc je vous demande de l'aide.
Repassez-moi le Lieutenant.
Major...
Passez-le-moi.
Oui, Monsieur.
Amenez-le ici.
Mimi, c'est ça ?
Oui.
Trish m'a dit que vous étiez préoccupée
par de l'argent qui aurait disparu.
J'aimerais voir vos comptes lŕ-dessus.
Bien sűr...
C'est Trish...
qui a le registre contenant l'erreur.
J'ai vu ses comptes,
les chiffres sont justes.
Oui, c'est vrai, ŕ moins
de les comparer avec mon registre,
dans ce cas, les chiffres
sont complčtement différents.
- J'aimerais voir votre registre.
- Je le garde ŕ la maison,
mais j'ai mis quelques notes
dans la marge de celui de <i>J&R</i>
et vous verrez que les différences
apparaissent avec la nouvelle monnaie.
S'il vous plaît,
ne le prenez pas mal, Mimi, mais...
je ne peux pas simplement
vous croire sur parole.
J'ai besoin de voir le registre.
Bien, s'il vous plaît,
ne le prenez pas mal,
mais si vous voulez
une supervision indépendante,
j'ai besoin d'indépendance.
Vous accusez quelqu'un
de cette société de détournement.
- C'est une grave accusation.
- Je n'accuse personne.
Je suis l'administrateur en chef de
cette ville et je veux votre registre.
Des informations de cette valeur
devraient ętre gardées en lieu sűr,
pas chez soi,
oů n'importe quoi peut arriver.
Eh bien, je l'amčnerai demain.
Merci.
Excusez-moi, s'il vous plaît.
Qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
Pas mal de choses, Monsieur.
Regardez...
Sur le disque dur récupéré
dans l'incendie,
on a trouvé des transcriptions de
communications sécurisées
entre la suspecte, Sarah Mason,
et son chef, jusque-lŕ non identifié.
"Cible éliminée avec succčs."
C'était une meurtričre ?
Ils parlent de 5 meurtres
dans les messages.
Ensuite, ça devient
vraiment intéressant.
On dirait qu'elle change de bord.
Lŕ, elle discute avec son chef le prix
d'un "paquet" qu'elle détient.
Mason a vendu la bombe ?
Presque.
Un RDV était prévu au Nebraska,
mais avorté ŕ la derničre seconde.
Pourquoi ?
Pas sűr, mais il semble
qu'elle ait profité d'une rencontre
pour pister l'acheteur jusqu'ŕ sa base.
Monsieur, Il y a męme une surveillance.
Lieutenant, vous ętes excusé.
Monsieur ?
Sortez. Maintenant.
Oui, Monsieur.
Eh bien, cela confirme mon intuition.
Mason était des opérations secrčtes.
Et ces meurtres ressemblent pour moi
ŕ un nettoyage, comme si une espčce...
de mission top secrčte avait mal tourné.
Du coup, tous les participants
devaient mourir.
C'est sűr,
elle a tué cet inconnu dans la maison,
sűrement sur l'ordre de ce...
męme chef.
Donc la question maintenant est
"Que nettoyaient-ils exactement ?"
On aurait complčtement raté ça
sans votre informateur.
Il n'y avait pas d'informateur,
n'est-ce pas ?
Pardon. Excusez-moi ?
J'ai vérifié
auprčs de mes adjoints sur le terrain.
Ils confirment qu'il y avait bien
un gang de la route dans cette région.
Le problčme, c'est qu'on a arręté
ce groupe il y a des semaines.
Cette zone est calme depuis.
Et alors ?
Réfléchissez-y ŕ deux fois
avant de dire un mot de plus.
Depuis que vous jouez dans mon bureau,
vous savez tout ce que je sais.
Ŕ chacune de mes questions,
vous avez une réponse.
Et puis, aujourd'hui...
Le tuyau venant de votre informateur,
l'incendie, le disque dur...
Vous me prenez pour un idiot ?
C'était trop facile.
Donnez-moi une seule raison
de ne pas défoncer votre porte
tout de suite.
Qu'avez-vous trouvé d'autre
sur ce disque dur ?
Vous savez ce qu'il contient.
Non.
Je ne sais pas.
Je crois que vous avez trouvé une chose
que vous ne voulez pas croire.
C'est bien ça ?
C'est un test, Major ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
C'est Thomas Valente ŕ droite.
Celui du ministčre
de la Sécurité Intérieure ?
Il m'a menti.
Sarah Mason travaillait bien
pour le gouvernement.
Elle travaillait pour lui.
Il y a quelque chose qui ne va pas ?
J'ai découvert
que quelqu'un vole de l'argent ŕ <i>J&R</i>,
et je pense qu'ils savent
que je suis sur leur piste.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Ne fais pas de bruit !
Que se passe-t-il ?
C'est Ravenwood, ils sont dehors.
<i>Il y a quelqu'un ?</i>
Si c'est le cas, vous devez sortir
et venir me parler.
Que veulent-ils ?
Le registre comptable.
Je les ai vus emmener Dale aujourd'hui.
Et s'ils ne voulaient pas
seulement le registre ?
- Je vais leur dire que tu n'es pas lŕ.
- Non, Bonnie, ne sors pas, Bonnie !
Madame.
Bonnie, c'est ça ?
Mimi Clark est-elle lŕ ?
J'aimerais vraiment lui parler.
Désolée, elle n'est pas lŕ.
Je vais jeter un oeil ŕ l'intérieur.
- Ils arrivent.
- Viens ! Allez.
Bonnie, Bonnie !
<i>La bombe est-elle en sécurité ?</i>
Ouais, c'est bon.
Merci pour l'alerte.
Pourquoi m'aidez-vous ?
<i>Je veux que la vérité éclate.</i>
<i>Tout comme vous.</i>
De quelle vérité vous parlez ?
<i>Ce gouvernement...</i>
<i>Ou devrais-je dire, cette entreprise.</i>
Quoi ?
Vous parlez de <i>Jennings & Rall</i> ?
Que dites-vous, qu'ils ont
quelque chose ŕ voir dans les attaques ?
Non, ça ne colle pas.
Les entreprises ne renversent pas
les gouvernements qui les enrichissent.
<i>Le projet Boxcar...</i>
<i>Ça vous dit quelque chose ?</i>
<i>On a le droit d'admettre son ignorance.</i>
<i>C'est comme ça qu'on apprend.</i>
<i>Le projet Boxcar...</i>
<i>L'opération secrčte lancée
par le gouvernement Cheyenne </i>
<i>pour éliminer toute preuve sur l'origine
des attaques de septembre.</i>
Une preuve ?
Quelle preuve ?
<i>Vous, votre bombe...</i>
<i>Vos coéquipiers.</i>
<i>Ce rapport...</i>
<i>Reçu de : Inconnu
Nouveau message image.</i>
<i>SUITE DU RAPPORT GOUVERNEMENTAL

<i>C'est un plan "catastrophe" top secret,</i>

<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>
<i>I'm Major Beck,</i>
10th Mountain Division.
I want you to be my liaison
to the people of Jericho.
<i>How's your search
for Sarah Mason going?</i>
<i>I'm sending you a private contractor
who knows the area,</i>
<i>who'll take care of the day-to-day
administration of the town</i>
<i>while you find the terrorist.</i>
<i>Hi, Dale!</i>
Where'd you get all this?
Missouri, Nebraska... We've been hitting
the big trading posts in the region.
<i>What's going</i> on?
We got word
there was some contraband
in Mr. Turner's
most recent shipment.
This'll all be shipped
back to Cheyenne to be disposed of.
<i>Western states</i> have all
fallen in with Cheyenne.
They're strong
and getting stronger.
This is our new mission:
expose Cheyenne's secret
<i>before they take over the whole country.</i>
I have the evidence
that could expose the whole cover-up.
I have one of the bombs.
<i>Mimi,</i> this is Trish Merrick.
She's with <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
<i>I cannot wait
to work in that office.</i>
You wouldn't believe how organized
the <i>Jennings and Rall</i> people are.
<i>I think...</i>
I'm gonna head
to Cheyenne with Trish.
Yeah?
I'm asking if Sarah Mason
has ever been in the employ
- of the U.S. government.
- <i>No. She hasn't.</i>
<i>I accept your offer</i>
to assist my search for Sarah Mason.
<i>What you're doing on my property?</i>
Guys, guys, it's OK.
Stanley...
Sorry about this, we just fix in
a flat tire and we're getting out here.
Dale, what the hell
you're doing out here?
You know, importing.
Importing at four o'clock
in the morning?
Here...
For looking any other way.
Stanley asked me
to return this to you.
Find another way into town.
Quit using his property.
- It's the safest way in.
- It's not suggestion.
It's hard enough getting
past those checkpoints.
You just made it ten times harder.
This isn't just about the booze.
The farmers, the merchants,
the clinics, they all need us.
If it wasn't for us, every business
in town would be in debt to J&R.
What are you doing?
Public notice that your business hasn't
yet registered with Jennings & Rall.
- What do you mean, register?
- Simple oversight.
There's still a lot of raiding
going on out on the roads.
Government's asking merchants to prove
they do not business with criminals.
You should talk to the sheriff
of theft and corruption
running rampant right now.
He should have some insight.
When you've you registered,
the notice will come down,
and you'll submit to weekly inspections
of your sales and inventory.
And if he doesn't?
Then I'll shut him down.
Yeah?
<i>Hawkins.</i>
<i>You don't have to answer.</i>
<i>I realize
I have some explaining to do.</i>
Who are you?
<i>For now, call me John Smith.</i>
<i>You don't know me,
but I know about you.</i>
No...
No, you don't know anything.
<i>You were tasked on Project Red Bell
with seven other agents.</i>
<i>A member of your own team,
Sarah Mason, betrayed you.</i>
<i>I know about Valente.</i>
<i>When I saw Chavez
was caught by Major Beck,</i>
<i>I figured either you
or Chueng couldn't be far.</i>
<i>So I reached out.</i>
<i>We have goals in common,</i>
<i>and I have information
that can help you.</i>
<i>But I want your assurance
that you won't try to find me.</i>
<i>Can you accept those terms?</i>
Let's agree on this:
You don't make the terms,
I do.
And if you have information
to share,
then you just share it.
But if you lie to me,
then know that I will find out,
and the next time we speak,
it will not be on the phone.
Those are the terms.
<i>Agreed.</i>
<i>Now, can we move on
to more urgent business?</i>
I'm listening.
<i>Good.</i>
<i>Because you're a day
away from being caught.</i>

J&R charges an arm
and a leg for stock, but...
I can't raise my prices
'cause of Cheyenne's price freeze.
So, buying from Dale
is the only way that I stay in business.
Mary's not alone.
Matt Carlson
sold his granary yesterday.
I am into these crooks
for 15 grand.
When I tried to go around them
to buy feed for my cattle,
they confiscated it,
froze my accounts...
Now my herd is statarving.
Food, supplies.
We're getting strangled here.
If we don't do something,
it will be to late.
We're talking about booze
and cows here.
- The Stamp Act, and the Sugar Act.
- What are you talking about?
The Boston Tea Party...
was it just about tea?
Look,
every revolution
that's ever been fought,
they-they started
in roomslike this.
- I disagree...
- Right. People have to take a stand...
Look, guys. Listen!
We're not talking about
a revolution.
We have a problem to solve,
so let's solve it,
- before it gets out of hand.
- No, J&R is out of hand.
Quiet!
We need a lifeline.
We need to find a way
to funnel in supplies
outside of J&R's control.
Dale, he has the trade connections,
he has the trucks.
Stanley...
we have to have your farm.
Why me? Wh...
There are army checkpoints
all over.
Your farm is the safest way
in and out of town...
I am one week away
from having a working farm again.
All right?
I need J&R on my side, understand?
So you're gonna leave here
to deal with them alone?
Come on.
Guys, this is not Red Dawn.
They gave me back my farm.
They forgave my debt.
We've got power again, jobs, food.
These people are here to help us,
can't you see that?
How? By taking over everything?
What's happened to us?
Gas prices were high
before the bomb.
Politicians were crooks,
corporations were evil.
That didn't mean
that we threw in with criminals, did it?
Criminals?
If it wasn't for this criminal,
you wouldn't be vaccinated
for the Hudson River Virus.
I'm sorry, Jake.
I'm out.
Stanley?
Would everybody calm down?
Just calm down a sec, all right?
We lost him.
What are we going to do now?
We will find you another way
to get into town.
It's going to be okay.
Hey.
You rang?
Tomorrow morning, a binder
will be delivered to Major Beck
from an Air Force reconnaissance
unit based in Cheyenne.
It'll contain an aerial radiation scan
of this entire area.
The bomb.
I-I thought
lead made it undetectable.
Oh, this is an advanced system.
Lead is not enough.
Well, then we need to move it.
The scan will get Beck closer,
but not all the way.
You see, anything with a high
enough atomic weight will present
in the same way as plutonium.
He's still got to search
the hot spots one at a time.
This cabin is going to be
one of those hot spots.
How do you know all this?
Only a hard copy
would have been sent.
They're not going to take any chances
with the Internet.
Now, that binder will be
in Beck's office with his secure files.
I need the page from the binder
that'll identify the bomb.
- I'm guessing that's my job.
- Within 24 hours, Jake.
48, at the most.
Before they got a chance to process
the data and map the hot spots.
Well, you got a plan
for getting Beck out of his office?
Matter of fact...
I do.
- Did you get the gas?
- Yeah, it's out by the car.
Where are you going?
I gotta burn down a house.
<i>If you are here to register,
you can get in line.</i>
<i>For currency exchange,</i>
<i>please have your two pieces
of identification out and ready.</i>
Mimi. I thought you were
doing the books from home today.
All finished.
Listen, I am so glad we have
you on board, I can't even tell you.
Well, don't speak too soon.
I found something odd
and I wanted to check my...
ledger against the J&R books.
What is it?
All the outgoing totals
you gave me match up,
until the new currency arrived.
Then suddenly,
there's a $10,000 discrepancy.
I'm sure it's just
an accounting error.
Perhaps Jennings & Rall
didn't deliver as much
of the new currency as their books say.
Oh, J&R is meticulous
about accounting.
They wouldn't make
a mistake like that.
Then someone took it.
How? I mean,
it came off the armored truck,
it checked into Jennings & Rall.
And it's been...
under armed guard ever since.
I guess you have
to figure out who had access.
You know what? Don't worry.
It's probably just a mistake.
I'll take care of it.
It's Fort Knox back there.
What is that?
Thumbprint scanner.
Getting that room ready
to house classified information.
It's a pretty short list
of people that'll have access.
Let me guess, I'm not on it?
But, if it's any consolation,
you now hold the distinction
of being the first
Jericho sheriff in history.
Who doesn't have a key
to the sheriff's office.
Who does have access?
Just the officers.
There's a list floating
around here.
Yeah.
Here you go.
<i>And here you go.</i>
Tell the lieutenant that...
the data's arrived.
I'll be wanting to get into it
as soon as possible.
So how many curfew violations
are we talking about?
Twelve within the New Bern city limits
since Tuesday.
That sounds about
par for the course.
Yeah, it's not the number
I'm worried about.
Britt Daniels, Randy Pope.
These six men here
all worked in the factory
making munitions whe I was there.
Things are getting tense there,
right?
Random violence,
friction with the J&R reps...
Yes.
I'm worried these aren't
random curfew violations.
It feels more organized to me.
They're testing the fence.
We'll monitor it.
Heather.
Thank you.
Forget him, too anxious.
Callahan's expecting
a field promotion.
He won't risk it.
Foster's dumb as a stump.
Put him down as a maybe.
How do you know all this?
Soldiers that man
these checkpoints hang out at her bar.
Making friends is my business.
Skylar says you wanted to see me.
Yeah.
You were driving through Stanley's land
to avoid all the checkpoints, right?
Yeah.
Well, what if you didn't have
to avoid them?
What if you could drive
right through them?
I'm told you have information
about who's been smuggling stolen
goods into town.
Before I say anything,
I want to know I'm going
to be able to keep my business.
I've got a family to think about.
Well, Fred,
I'm sure
we can work something out.
The kid.
Dale Turner.
He's the key to the whole thing.
What?
I can't get it.
- I can't get the binder.
- What do you mean?
I mean,
short of cutting off someone's thumb,
I can't get into Beck's office.
Plan's in motion, Jake.
Things change in the field,
you've just got to adapt.
There is someone.
And Beck trusts her.
She's been monitoring
his field reports from New Bern.
She can get close to the data
without being detected,
but she's smart.
We're going to have to tell her.
- Tell her what?
- Tell her why we need the page.
Oh, there you go again.
Every time we hit a snag,
your answer is just to bring
somebody else in.
You can trust her.
You said the same thing
of this journalist.
You think I don't know that?
I care about this person.
I don't. And you see this?
This is not some secret club
where we just invite people
in when it is convenient.
Why don't you tell me what to do?!
Just tell me!
Eight people have access
to that room
and seven of them are military.
Now, if you want to get in there
in the next 24 hours,
you show me!
Show me how!
Now,
I feel as though I'm being a pretty
good sport about all this, but,
I mean at some point you're going
to explain what we're doing here, right?
Yeah.
- Hey. She here?
- Yeah.
I'm going to ask for your help today.
And that requires that you be told some
very dangerous information.
You should know that there's only five
people outside of the Cheyenne
Government who know what it is
that I'm about to tell you.
And that there are those that will
kill to prevent it from coming to light.
Why would I agree to that?
You already put your life
on the line for this town,
and the last thing
that I want to do is...
is to ask you to do it again, but...
I feel like if you understand
what's at stake, you'll want to help.
What's at stake?
I believe it's the future
of our country.
Heather...
Do you want me to keep talking?
I'm listening.
You wanted to see me, Trish?
Yes. I wanted to talk to you
about an accounting issue.
Work, it's boring.
I don't believe we've met.
Bonnie Richmond.
This is John Goetz.
He's our Administrator.
What was it you needed me for?
It's come to my attention that
since we've issued the new currency,
some money may have gone missing.
Really? How much?
$10,000.
Here's my incident report so that
you can start a formal investigation.
Where exactly did you get
your information?
The accountant that we hired locally,
she found the discrepancy.
Maybe she made a mistake.
Sometimes a local hire
doesn't have the whole picture.
She keeps a set of books to herself
so that she can check
them against the J&R books.
She believes that the J&R
books may have been altered.
I see.
Look, you and I both know
how seriously J&R
takes embezzling.
Zero tolerance.
For the sake of both of our jobs,
I believe that it's important
that we handle this correctly.
You're absolutely right. Thank you
for bringing this to my attention.
I'm going to look into this right away.
Here you go, Timmy.
Thank you, ma'am.
Got word from Jane yet?
Nah.
Battalion S-2's being a real
Jerk about mail from the East.
Says it's a security risk.
Appreciate you asking.
She must miss the hell out of you.
Don't worry, soon as my tour's through,
she'll get enough of me.
How's business?
It's hard to keep the shelves
stocked with you boys around.
Just make sure there's
a bourbon waiting for me later.
Well, I'll try.
I'm running pretty low.
You gonna be at your checkpoint tonight?
Yes, ma'am.
'Cause I could make a call.
Maybe you could look the
other way for just one truck.
You're asking me to commit a crime.
Just booze.
Just booze?
Yeah, all right.
You got it.
Thanks, Timmy.
Not your lucky day, kid.
The government,
the army and the news,
they're all lying about who's
responsible for the attacks?
Yes.
But you're telling the truth?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Okay.
Okay, okay, all right.
- What do you want me to do?
- All right,
there's a binder
in Beck's office.
We need you to remove one page from it.
- Beck's involved in this, too?!
- Not directly, no.
- Beck's a good man.
- Yes, he is,
but he is taking orders from some very
bad people in the Cheyenne government.
What's in the binder?
Data from an aerial radiation survey.
Radiation?
Radiation?
What the hell's going on here?
Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
- Yes.
- All right.
This has to happen today. Hawkins
is gonna get Beck out of his office.
I'm sorry
for dragging you into this.
There's no other way.
Okay.
Mr. Hawkins.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
I was,
wondering when I'd hear from you next.
How quickly can you
deploy some men to Nebraska?
Why? What's in Nebraska?
I have an informant,
part of a road gang
operating along I-80.
He just confirmed a visual I.D.
on Sarah Mason.
Doing what?
She was spotted at a remote farmhouse.
It's probably a safe house.
- Is this reliable intel?
- Major,
Mason doesn't stay in the same place
for too long.
So can we move on this?
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.
I need a patrol on me.
Radio Camp Liberty, tell 'em I want
two Apaches on ready standby.
Roger that.
California?
Yeah, I'll expect a postcard
at least once a week, okay,
preferably with girls in bikinis
And if they're naked,
- that's even better.
They must have caught him smuggling.
This isn't right. Let's go.
Take it around again,
Captain, we have to be sure.
Out.
Major,
anything?
No sign of Mason anywhere,
and we got helos all over the state.
Sir, definitely an Arson job.
We also found spent bullet casings
from two different weapons.
- Somebody had a shootout.
- What about the body you found?
Burnt to a crisp, but judging
from the bone structure, it's male.
- DNA sample's on its way to be scanned.
- Another dead end, I'm sure.
The fire melted all the
computer equipment in the house,
but we found this hidden
behind the basement wall.
Some sort of hard drive.
Looks salvageable.
What do you make of all this?
I think Mason came
here to tie up a loose end.
I think this fire was supposed
to be thorough, and...
I think she missed something.
I want to see what's on it.
Take it to the techs right away.
Yes, sir.
What are you doing in here?
We want Dale Turner.
Get him out here.
Can't do it, Sheriff.
This is not a Jail
and you don't just hold people.
If Dale's accused of a crime,
the Sheriff office will investigate.
That won't be necessary.
A truck full of contraband
meets my burden of proof.
- You can't keep him here forever.
- I agree.
I turned him over to the
military police ten minutes ago.
He's on his way to Loomer
Ridge Prison as we speak.
You sent him to prison?
The kid is guilty.
The authority is mine.
I'm sending a message.
There's no place for thieves in Jericho.
If saying throw us in prison
whenever he wants,
- makes you think that stops with Dale?
- The vaccines, registrations,
the gouging, now this.
We're losing this town.
We got to get there, right?
They got a ten-minute head start.
Chasing truck is the way
of getting ourselves shot at.
Probably. Go find Beck.
I need you to relay a message.
What he say. He don't have
the authority to do anything.
We're going to give him the authority.
At ease. What's going on?
Sir, I found this woman in your office.
She has clearance to be in this office.
What's the problem?
I believe she was accessing
secure information, sir,
outside her area of clearance.
Were you looking at anything in
my office other than the New Bern files?
No, I wasn't.
I needed to check
something in your inbox.
Problem solved.
Thanks for your help Sergeant.
Sir, with all due respect, I don't
believe her to be telling the truth.
I believe she is telling the truth.
Are you questioning my judgment?
No, sir.
You're dismissed.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you? My apologies.
I hope the sergeant's actions haven't
colored your faith in this office.
I'd consider that a crime.
Let me do the talking.
Keep your hands up.
- Clear the road.
- Right...
there's been a mistake.
And I'm the Sheriff,
the kid should be in my custody.
- Clear the road or I will shoot.
- I have orders from Major Beck!
This is your last warning.
Radio Major Beck,
10th Mountain Division.
- This is not the way I get orders.
- Just call him. He'll explain.
Clear the road or I am opening fire.
Sir.
A major from Headquarters
is on the horn.
Sir?
Yes, sir, he is.
Yes, sir.
He wants to talk to you.
Major?
<i>You mind telling me
what you think you're doing?</i>
Major, I need your help.
<i>Your brother tells me you
want me to identify a 16-year-old kid</i>
<i>with no discernible value
as a confidential terror informant.</i>
But if he's a part
of your investigation,
then Goetz loses all authority over him.
<i>- Are you out of your mind?</i>
- He's a kid.
He's a 16-year-old kid and Goetz
is sending him to prison with
no judge, no trial, nothing.
It's a mistake,
and you have the ability to do something
about it, so I'm asking you to help.
<i>Put the lieutenant back on.</i>
Major...
<i>Put him on.</i>
Yes, sir.
Bring him up here.
It's Mimi, right?
Yes.
Trish told me you're concerned
some money may have gone missing.
I'd like to see your math on that.
Sure...
Trish has the ledger
with the discrepancy in it.
I saw her book, the numbers looked fine.
Well, they do unless you compare
them with my ledger,
in which case the numbers
are different entirely.
- I'd like to see your ledger.
- I keep that at home, but
I did make some notations
in the margins of the J&R book
and you see that our numbers started to
diverge when the new currency arrived.
Please don't take this the wrong way,
Mimi, but
I can't just take your word for it.
I need to see the ledger.
Well, please don't take
this the wrong way,
but in order to provide independent
oversight, I need to be independent.
You're accusing someone
in this company of embezzlement.
- That's a very serious charge.
- I'm not accusing anyone.
I'm the chief administrator
of this town and I want your ledger.
Valuable information like
that should be kept in a safe place,
not at home where practically
anything could happen to it.
Well, I will bring it tomorrow.
Thank you.
Excuse me, please.
What do we got?
Quite a lot, sir. Take a look.
On the hard drive recovered from
the fire, we found transcripts of
secured communication
between the suspect
Sarah Mason and a boss,
so far unidentified.
"Target successfully terminated."
She was an assassin?
They discuss five
murders in the messages.
Then it gets really interesting.
Looks like she turned.
Here she and her boss discuss the
sale of a "package" in her possession.
Mason sold the bomb?
Almost.
A meet was arranged in Nebraska,
but she balked at the last second.
- Why?
- Unclear.
However, it looks like she used a meet
to track her buyer
back to his base of operations.
Sir, there's even surveillance.
Lieutenant, you're excused.
Sir?
Leave the room. Now.
Yes, sir.
Well, it confirms my hunch.
Mason was Black Ops.
And these murders look like a
clean-up to me, like some kind of
top secret operation gone bad.
So anyone connected to it has to die.
Safe to say,
she killed that John Doe at the house.
Probably on the orders of this...
same boss.
So the question now is,
what exactly are they cleaning up?
We might have missed this entirely
if it wasn't for your informant.
There was no informant, was there?
Sorry. Excuse me?
After our trip,
I checked with my field commanders.
They confirmed that, there
was a nasty road gang in that region.
Problem is we smashed
up that operation weeks ago.
The area's been quiet ever since.
So what are you saying?
Think twice before you say another word.
Ever since you waltzed into my office,
you know everything I know.
Every question I had, you had an answer.
And then today.
The tip from your C.I.
The fire. The hard drive.
You think I'm an idiot?
It was too easy.
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't kick
in the door
to your house right now?
What else did you
find on that hard drive?
You know what's there.
No.
I don't.
I think you found something
that you don't want to believe, though.
That what this is?
This a test, Major?
What am I looking at?
That's Thomas Valente on the right.
As in the Department
of Homeland Security?
He lied to me.
Sarah Mason did work for the government.
She worked for him.
Is there something wrong?
I found out that someone
is stealing money from J&R,
and I think that they know
that I'm on to them.
Oh, my God.
- Don't make any noise.
- What's going on?
It's Ravenwood. They're outside.
Anybody in there?
If you are, you need to
come out here and talk to me.
What do they want?
The ledger.
I saw them take Dale today.
What if they don't just want the ledger?
- I'll tell them you're not here.
- No, Bonnie, don't go outside.
Bonnie! Bonnie!
Ma'am.
Bonnie, right?
Is Mimi Clark inside?
I'd really like to talk to her.
Sorry. She's not here.
I'm going to have a look inside.
- They're coming.
- Come on! Come. Come.
Bonnie, hide! Bonnie!
<i>Is the bomb secure?</i>
Yeah, it is.
And thanks for the warning.
Why are you helping me?
<i>I want the truth to come out.</i>
<i>Same as you.</i>
What truth would that be?
<i>This Government.</i>
<i>Or should I say, this company.</i>
What?
You mean Jennings & Rall?
What are you saying, they
got something to do with the attacks?
No, that doesn't compute.
Corporations don't overthrow
governments that enrich them.
<i>Project Boxcar.</i>
<i>You're familiar?</i>
<i>It's all right to admit ignorance.</i>
<i>It's how we learn.</i>
<i>Project Boxcar.</i>
<i>The covert operation run by
the Cheyenne government to eliminate</i>
<i>any and all evidence about
the origin of the September attacks.</i>
Evidence?
What evidence?
<i>You. Your bomb.</i>
<i>Your teammates.</i>
<i>This report...</i>
What is this?
<i>That is a classified disaster plan.</i>
<i>Commissioned by the government,</i>
<i>prepared by Jennings & Rall.</i>
<i>25 cities</i>
<i>destroyed from the ground
by nuclear weapons.</i>
<i>Target specifications,</i>
<i>contingencies, chinks in our armor.</i>
<i>Jennings & Rall put it all in one place.</i>
<i>It was supposed to protect us.</i>
<i>But someone got a hold of it.</i>
<i>They took our worst nightmare
and made it come true.</i>
Okay.
How do you know about this?
<i>Because...</i>
<i>I helped write it.</i>

Et voici Russell et Mike.
Salut. Ravi de te connaître.
<i>Je suis le major Beck,</i>

Notre nouvelle mission :

J'ai une des bombes.
C'est quoi, ça ?
<i>Les spécificités des cibles,</i>

<i>Jennings & Rall ont tout rassemblé.</i>

Bonnie, c'est ça ?
Mimi Clark est-elle là ?
Mimi va s'en sortir ?
Elle a perdu beaucoup de sang.
Qu'as-tu trouvé ?
Un neuf millimètres.
Les traces de pneus devant...
on dirait un Humvee.
Ravenwood.
- Mais pourquoi ?
- Que voulaient-ils ?
Quoi que ce soit,
Mimi ne devait pas survivre.
On fait quoi ?
On rassemble les Rangers à la clinique,
elle doit être protégée.
Ravenwood
ne s'approchera pas d'elle.
Major ?
Dites à la section de se tenir prête.
On se retrouve à 50 km.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Il y eut une fusillade
chez les Richmond.
- Goetz me l'a appris.
- Qu'a-t-il dit ?
Il dit être venu
régler une affaire <i>J&R</i>,
quelqu'un lui a tiré dessus,
et a tué trois de ses hommes.
- Et vous l'avez cru ?
- Vous avez des infos que j'ignore ?
Il y a une survivante, inconsciente,
une fois réveillée, elle...
Monsieur, on est prêt, on attend.
- Désolé, Jake, je dois y aller.
- Où ça ?!
Il y a 20 min, une bombe a explosé
au bureau <i>J&R</i> de New Bern.
Six de mes hommes sont morts.
Je reviens dans douze heures.
- Ça n'attendra pas 12 heures.
- Il faudra bien.
Les choses dérapent à New Bern
pour l'instant.
Demain, promis, je m'en occuperai,
mais pour ce soir, j'ai l'espoir
que vous puissiez maintenir l'ordre.
Goetz est hors de contrôle.
Pas de menace, pas de vengeance,
pas d'exception.
Compris ?
Une entrée.
- Sortie étroite.
- Ça va aller ?
Je voudrais
que vous évacuiez la pièce.
- Je vous en prie.
- Allez. Viens.
Beck va à New Bern.
On est seuls.
Bill, Marty,
vous prenez l'entrée.
Greg et Dave, l'arrière.
Au moindre signe de Goetz,
prévenez-moi avant d'agir. Tous.
Stan.
- Vous l'emmenez à la morgue ?
- Oui.
J'y vais.
Il devrait pas rester seul.
Je veillerai sur lui.
Ils viennent d'admettre Mimi Clark
à la clinique pour blessure par balle.
Elle était dans la maison ?
Mme Hawkins,
voilà votre ordonnance.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Tous nos jeunes ont de la fièvre,
alors...
Jake !
Goetz est dehors.
Ne bougez pas.
Jake.
Il paraît que Mimi Clark est là,
je dois la voir.
Jake, ne faites rien de stupide.
Mimi Clark est témoin du meurtre
de trois de mes hommes.
Il se peut qu'elle ait vu
l'un des tireurs.
- Elle doit répondre à mes questions.
- Vous n'entrerez pas !
Alors on a un problème.
Saison 2 Épisode 05
<i>- Termination for cause -</i>
Transcript : <i>Raceman - www.forom.com</i>
Sync : <i>¤AkaZab¤, Babybello, The Lovers</i>
<i>A²S Team www.All-about-Subs.fr</i>
Réfléchissez bien
aux conséquences de vos actes, Jake.
Si vous tuez
un responsable de Ravenwood,
Cheyenne classifiera cette ville
comme une enclave d'insurgés.
Quand ils sévissent,
tout le monde en souffre.
C'est ce que vous voulez ?
On dirait
que la nuit va être longue.
Vous voulez vraiment
la jouer comme ça ?
Essayer d'entrez dans cet immeuble
et vous verrez bien.
<i>Merci, madame, on vous recontacte
à 2 h pour faire le point.</i>
<i>Red one, terminé.</i>
Bonne nuit.
Heather.
Russell ?
Comment êtes-vous entrés ?
C'était pas facile,
on a dû éviter les check points
et les patrouilles armées.
Ça va mal à New Bern, Heather.
Et tu rends les choses
plus difficiles.
De quoi parles-tu ?
La résistance de New Bern
a mis une prime sur ta tête.
On a été envoyé pour la récupérer.
Y'à un endroit où on peut parler ?
<i>Donc, d'après ce rapport,</i>
je dirais que vous êtes...
un ancien employé de <i>J&R</i>, non ?
S'assurant que les péchés
de la société sont découverts.
<i>C'est à peu près ça.</i>
Alors pourquoi ne pas
juste tirer la sonnette d'alarme ?
- Pourquoi avez-vous besoin de moi ?
- <i>Je n'ai pas besoin de vous.</i>
<i>J'ai besoin de votre bombe.</i>
<i>C'est une preuve tangible
et irréfutable,</i>
<i>pas comme des mots
écrits sur une page.</i>
<i>Faire tomber J&R
et le gouvernement de Cheyenne</i>
<i>ne requiert que ça.</i>
Et quel haut placé
est le lien entre eux deux ?
<i>À votre avis ?</i>
Je pense à Valente.
<i>Pensez à plus haut.</i>
Vous voulez dire le président ?
<i>Il y a 10 ans,
John Tomarchio était une jeune star</i>
<i>au sein de la société J&R.</i>
<i>La société a été
le donateur majeur</i>
<i>dans sa première
campagne électorale.</i>
<i>Son cabinet,</i>
<i>ses conseillers,</i>
<i>tous venus
des entrailles nauséabondes de J&R.</i>
Au plus haut niveau,
ce gouvernement et cette société
ne font qu'un.
Les barricades
sont à moitié montées.
Encore une dizaine de min...
C'était prévisible.
Laissez tomber les barricades.
Il nous reste peu de temps.
J'ai besoin d'aide.
Quelqu'un doit m'éclairer.
Tous mes hommes gardent les portes.
Pardon, Madame...
- Darcy.
- Vous êtes embauchée.
Des civils armés, otages potentiels,
monsieur.
Quatre heures, compris.
Merci, Monsieur.
On dirait qu'il n'y aura
que nous douze, pour un moment.
On s'organise pour un siège ?
Ou on passe directement
à la phase 2.
Le temps que Beck soit revenu,
on aura terminé ici.
- Commençons par frapper à la porte.
- Compris.
Elle va bien ?
On lui a tiré dessus...
La balle a perforé le muscle pectoral,
et a manqué
l'artère sous-clavière et le poumon.
Désolé, je n'y comprends rien.
On peut dire
que tout bien considéré,
ça aurait pu être pire.
Scalpel N°11, s'il vous plaît.
Hé, Stanley.
Stanley, ce n'est pas ta faute.
De quoi parles-tu ?
Quand...
quand April est morte,
je n'arrêtais pas de penser
que j'en avais pas assez fait, que...
que c'était ma faute.
À la mort de mes parents,
je l'ai fait aussi.
Je m'en suis voulu.
Je me détestais
d'être encore en vie.
Mais il fallait s'occuper
de cette petite fille.
Ça m'a déchiré.
Je sais,
c'est plus dur.
Tes parents, c'était...
c'était un accident...
la main de Dieu.
C'est toujours Dieu ?
Je ne suis pas responsable.
- Jake.
- Quoi ? Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je ne sais pas, Goetz est bizarre,
il a quelqu'un avec lui.
Fred.
Allo.
Gary, c'est ta femme.
Allo.
D'accord, calme-toi.
Je... je t'aime aussi.
C'est Chloé.
Elle est dehors.
Ils sont allés la chercher
et l'ont ramené.
Écoutez, je suis avec vous, mais...
elle est complètement paniquée.
Vas-y.
- Si elle est là, dehors...
- Ça va.
Vas-y.
C'est bon, Gary.
Ils vont s'en prendre
à nos familles ?
D. ?
Darcy ?
D. ?
M. Hawkins ?
Je peux vous aider ?
Peut-on entrer ?
On est passés il y a une heure,
vous n'étiez pas là.
- Que puis-je pour vous ?
- Monsieur,
êtes-vous de la famille de...
Darcy Hawkins ?
Oui.
Que se passe-t-il ?
OK,
un groupe armé
a pris le contrôle de la clinique.
On pense
qu'elle fait partie des otages.
Vraiment ?
D'accord, donc...
que puis-je faire ?
Eh bien, on voudrait que vous veniez
et lui parliez au téléphone.
Essayez de la convaincre
de se sortir d'une situation dangereuse.
Je ne comprends pas.
Si elle est otage, comment lui parler
pourrait la faire sortir de là ?
On vous expliquera tout
sur les lieux, mais...
on doit vous y emmener maintenant.
D'accord.
D'accord. Je suis garé devant,
je prends juste mes clés.
Monsieur ?
Ce serait mieux
que vous veniez avec nous.
D'accord.
Où est ma femme ?
Bonjour, Mimi.
Où suis-je ?
À la clinique.
Tu vas t'en sortir.
Où sont Stanley et Bonnie ?
L'infirmière ne va pas tarder.
Je lui ai dit que je veillais sur toi.
Je vais la chercher.
Attends, s'il te plaît.
Où est Stanley ?
Stanley est en bas.
Et Bonnie ?
Je suis navrée.
Dès que Beck nous a catalogués
comme les agresseurs de Jericho,
ils nous a pris à la gorge.
Couvre-feu, tribunal militaire,
check-points armé.
La résistance s'est vite organisée.
Pendant des semaines,
on avait un coup d'avance.
Et d'un coup,
il nous est tombé dessus.
Certains tuyaux
que tu as donnés à Beck,
nous ont vraiment
compliqué les choses.
Ça nous a coûté des vies.
Au moment où Constantino
a découvert que c'était toi,
il a décidé la prime.
Attendez.
Vous travaillez avec Constantino ?
- Russel, c'est un meurtrier.
- Tu crois que je ne le sais pas.
Beaucoup de gens censés
se joignent à lui.
Beck ne nous a laissé
aucune alternative.
Donc, si vous êtes venus me tuer,
pourquoi suis-je encore vivante ?
Je suis venu te convaincre
d'arrêter ce que tu faisais.
Et ramener un petit trophée.
Quel genre de trophée ?
Goetz...
Tu veux bien
aller voir Mimi pour moi ?
On devrait y aller ensemble, non ?
J'arrive, c'est juste que...
Laisse-moi une minute ou deux.
Merci.
Juste une minute, OK ?
Ça va ?
Je sais, je sais...
Je suis un idiot.
Certainement que...
tu te moquerais de moi, non ?
Je voulais juste te dire...
Mimi...
est vivante
grâce à toi.
Et je voulais...
... te dire...
merci.
Merci.
Ma sœur
... me manque.
Dis à papa et maman...
que je les aime.
Je t'aime.
Que faites-vous ici ?
On change d'équipe ?
Hé ! Je vous parle !
Qui est-ce ?
<i>Jimmy, ouvre la porte.</i>
M. Hawkins ?
<i>Oui.</i>
J'apporte des cadeaux.
On a 12 hommes. Et, à y regarder,
c'est pareil pour eux.
Ils en ont trois de moins
qu'avant.
Ça sera bien assez
pour menacer la famille d'un d'autre.
- Ils voulaient t'utiliser comme appât !
- Ils voulaient.
- Où est ma femme, Jake ?
- Elle aide à soigner Mimi.
Dis-moi ce qui se passe
vraiment ici.
On a ratissé la zone.
On a trouvé Burke et Sloan
à l'entrée de service.
- Morts.
- Morts ?
- Et Stanton et Bulger ?
- Toujours pas de nouvelles d'eux.
Très bien, faites un autre tour.
Je veux savoir ce qui se passe.
Fred.
Vous allez bien ?
Oui. Oui, madame.
Oui. Pourquoi...
n'allez-vous pas chercher de l'eau ?
Oui. Merci.
Où est Stanley ?
Il est avec Bonnie.
Il va bientôt monter.
Excusez-moi.
Avez-vous la moindre idée
de ce qui est arrivé ?
C'est parce que Goetz
détourne les fonds
des caisses de <i>J&R</i>.
J'en ai la preuve...
dans mon registre.
Ils peuvent tolérer la mort de civils,
mais quand on tape dans les caisses,
<i>J&R</i> est beaucoup moins indulgents.
Tolérance zéro.
Mon registre était à la maison.
Je suis sûre qu'il l'a maintenant.
Y-a-t-il un moyen
de reconstituer ces données ?
Si vous avez accès au système.
Peut-être.
<i>Hawkins.</i>
J'ai besoin de votre aide.
<i>Ce n'est pas ce que
je suis en train de faire ?</i>
C'est un petit peu différent.
Cela dépasse les limites de
nos conversations habituelles.
<i>Je dois me montrer prudent
quand je montre mon nez.</i>
<i>Quand, où...</i>
<i>et pour qui.</i>
Maintenant, écoutez-moi.
Je ne sais pas
ce que vous attendez de moi.
Mais je sais que vous ne me donnez pas
d'informations pour mes beaux yeux.
Je vous promets que...
si vous ne me faites pas
cette faveur,
alors nos relations
se termineront ici et maintenant.
- Je vous écoute.
- Merci.
Y-a-t-il quelqu'un chez <i>J&R</i>
en qui on peut avoir confiance ?
Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'on doit reconstituer
les informations du registre.
Y-a-t-il quelqu'un
qui pourrait nous y aider ?
Il y a quelqu'un.
Bien. Appelez-le.
Que voulez-vous que je lui dise ?
Dites-lui...
de réunir toutes les infos
et de les envoyer
à cette adresse.
C'est l'e-mail personnel du directeur
des opérations de Ravenwood.
Où l'avez-vous obtenu ?
Ne pose pas de questions.
Jake.
On a un problème.
Tu vas bien ?
Il a surgi de nulle part.
Frank, où est ton arme ?
Il n'avait aucun moyen
de s'échapper.
Non.
Pas sans aide.
- L'un d'entre nous.
- Oui.
D'abord, on doit trouver
notre ami de Ravenwood.
Combien de vos hommes
surveillent les sorties ?
Deux a chacune.
Mais s'il commence à les descendre,
Goetz pourra entrer,
et on ne peut pas
retirer quelqu'un de la porte de Mimi.
- Jake, on doit le trouver.
- On le trouvera.
Après ça, on devra trouver
un moyen de sortir.
Jake...
Oui.
Tu en es sûre ?
Oui, quasiment sûr.
Eh bien, on pourrait l'utiliser.
Jimmy. Bill.
Vos gars
vont faire disparaître Goetz ?
Le tuer de sang-froid ?
J'ai une poignée de gars
qui sont à sa recherche.
Russell.
Que t'est-il arrivé ?
Goetz a exécuté trois de mes voisins
à New Bern, il y a quelques mois,
et ce gouvernement
lui a donné de l'avancement.
Ça fait des semaines
que Beck étrangle ma ville natale.
Et ce même gouvernement
dit que j'ai tort.
C'en est assez.
On règle le souci Goetz à New Bern,
et on montre à Goetz
qu'on n'est pas prêt de partir.
Je sais que les choses vont mal,
mais à la minute où
vous vous lancerez avec Constantino,
vous abandonnerez
votre position de force.
Beck va vous combattre.
Je suis désolée,
car je vais l'aider à le faire.
Ça me désole d'entendre ça.
Un petit conseil ?
Priez pour que j'attrape Goetz,
sinon,
ce n'est pas moi que Constantino
mettra à tes trousses.
Allo.
<i>Trish.</i>
Mimi ?
Trish, Bonnie est morte.
Oh mon dieu.
<i>Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?</i>
C'était Goetz et ses hommes.
Ils l'ont tuée pour le registre.
<i>Trish, j'ai besoin de ton aide.</i>
Qu'est-ce que je peux faire ?
J'espère que ça va marcher.
Ça va marcher.
Il faut juste qu'il soit
un peu plus grand.
C'est trop petit ?
Quoi tu ne penses pas
que je passe dans ce trou ?
Tu devrais l'agrandir.
<i> Va dans le fichier de sauvegarde
dans ce répertoire.</i>
<i>C'est là que se trouvent
les chiffres modifiés par Goetz.</i>
C'est bon, je les ai.
<i>Maintenant que veux-tu que j'en fasse ?</i>
Je vais te donner une adresse email
et un code à mettre dans ligne "objet".
Mimi, je suis vraiment désolée.
Ce n'est pas ta faute.
Mimi, c'est moi qui en ai parlé
à Goetz.
Je sais.
Tu vas le faire pour moi ?
Ouais.
Ouais.
Merci.
Salut.
Salut.
- Je suis tellement désolée.
- Arrête Mimi.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Non.
Je n'aurai jamais dû ouvrir ma bouche.
J'aurais dû la garder fermée.
Écoute-moi.
Tu étais en danger.
Bonnie a fait ce qu'elle devait
pour te protéger et...
tu es vivante.
Où qu'elle soit maintenant...
je te jure
qu'elle se réjouit de l'avoir fait.
Ouais.
Quel type d'arme ?
- Quoi ?
- Quel type d'arme a Frank ?
Un Beretta 9 mm.
Sept !
Cinq !
Quatre ! Trois ! Deux !
Que veux-tu faire de lui ?
Vous ne sortirez jamais vivant d'ici.
- Toutes les issues sont surveillées.
- T'en es sûr ?
C'était quoi tout ça ?
On l'a ciblé
et échangé des coups de feu.
Vous l'avez eu ?
Non, il s'est enfui.
Il doit encore être à l'intérieur.
Que Marty et Dave quittent l'entrée
pour prêter renfort à la surveillance
de mimi. Fred, prends leur place.
Ils y ont passé la nuit.
Ils ont besoin de repos.
OK. OK. D'accord.
Goetz.
La porte arrière va être dégagée.
Vraiment ?
- Cinq minutes.
- Compris.
Fini.
On est dedans.
- Dites-moi ce qui se passe ici, bordel.
- Ils sont partis, monsieur.
Je peux voir ça.
Où sont-ils allés ?
Je ne sais pas. Quelque part par
une autre sortie près de la pharmacie.
Il n'y a pas de sortie par là.
Monsieur,
je pense que
vous devriez venir voir ça.
- Qu'y a-t-il derrière ce trou ?
- Un hangar à matériel agricole.
Apparemment,
c'est le même bâtiment.
Ça n'a pas de sens.
On a couvert tout le périmètre.
Ils ne m'en ont pas parlé.
Sans déconner.
Vous avez servi de taupe, imbécile.
Je les ai entendus parler
d'emmener la femme à sa ferme.
La cacher jusqu'au retour de Beck.
Que faisons-nous ?
En voiture.
Rediriger les renforts
à la jonction de la route 23.
- Attrapons-les en route.
- Allons-y.
Ils sont partis ?
- Jake, attends.
- Ils sont partis ?
C'est dégagé.
Allons-y.
Jake,
Jake, j'avais pas le choix.
Il parlait de saisir ma ferme.
Il a menacé ma femme.
Rentre chez toi, Fred.
- Jake, je t'en supplie...
- Rentre chez toi, Fred.
Rentre chez toi.
Jake, leurs renforts arrivent.
Ils parlaient de retrouver une centaine
d'hommes de Ravenwood au carrefour.
À 8h du matin. À l'intersection
de la Route 23 et Cherry Valley.
Allons-y.
Hé, pas encore.
Vérifiez vos chargeurs.
Ce sont leurs renforts ?
Non.
Regarde.
Je suis le directeur Jamison,
Directeur du QG régional de Ravenwood.
Les gars chargez-moi tout ça.
Nous partons.
Monsieur, je suis au beau
milieu d'une opération ici.
Non.
Saisissez leurs armes !
Allons-y !
Où allons-nous ?
Ils sont redéployés.
Vous êtes viré.
De quoi tu parles ?
Tu peux pas me virer.
Non, je peux pas mais, lui oui.
En fait, c'est déjà fait.
Ça fait du bien ?
J'espère que
vous pourrirez en enfer.
Laissez-les ici.
Ils peuvent rentrer à pied.
Roulez !
Maintenant ?
Ouais, maintenant.
Goetz !
Goetz !
Goetz, je veux voir tes mains !
Souvenez-vous, il nous le faut vivant !
Hors de question.
Qui est-ce ?
Cessez-le-feu ! Cessez-le-feu !
Ne tirez pas !
- Qu'est-ce que vous foutez là ?!
- Je viens pour lui.
Mes hommes l'ont
pisté toute la nuit,
attendant une chance de l'attraper.
- Merci.
- Hors de question, Russell.
Vous ne pouvez pas le prendre.
Tu veux parier ?
- Je le ramène à Beck.
- Le ramener ?
S'il apprend sa mort,
Beck va déclencher un déluge
de représailles sur nos villes.
New Bern doit répondre de 3 meurtres.
Ouais, bon, il est à Jericho
et, arrêté pour le meurtre
de Bonnie Richmond.
On combat une armée
qui a plus d'armes que nous,
plus d'hommes que nous.
On doit trouver des solutions.
Et Goetz est un moyen
de trouver des solutions.
Stanley.
Stanley.
Stanley.
Restez là.
Jake, c'est pas un problème.
Que Goetz soit porté disparu
ou qu'on retrouve son corps,
Beck remontera notre piste.
Tu sais qu'il le fera.
À la minute où ce corps a touché le sol,
c'est devenu
un deal totalement différent.
Alors où en êtes-vous, Capitaine ?
<i>La zone est calme, Monsieur.</i>
<i>Aucun signe d'activité des insurgés.</i>
Bien reçu. Terminé.
- Quoi ?
- Monsieur...
vous voudrez voir ça vous-même.

<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>
Jake, this is Ted Lewis.
- Hey, how you doing?
- We grew up together over in New Bern.
And this is Russell and Mike.
Hey. Yeah, we met.
<i>I'm Major Beck,</i>
10th Mountain Division.
<i>I want you</i> to be my liaison
to the people of New Bern and Jericho.
<i>I'm sending you a private contractor
who knows the area.</i>
<i>He'll take care of the day-to-day
administration of the town</i>
<i>while you find the terrorist.</i>
Western states have all fallen
in with Cheyenne.
They're strong and getting stronger.
This is our new mission.
Expose Cheyenne's secret
before they take over the whole country.
I have one of the bombs.
What is this?
<i>Targets, specifications,</i>
<i>contingencies.</i>
<i>Jennings & Rall
put it all in one place.</i>
How do you know about this?
<i>Because... I helped write it.</i>
Mimi, this is Trish Merrick.
She's with Jennings & Rall.
<i>I'm so glad</i> we have you on board,
I can't even tell you.
There's a $10,000 discrepancy.
Someone took it.
I'm the chief administrator of this town
and I want your ledger.
Bonnie, right?
Is Mimi Clark inside?
Mimi going to be okay?
She's lost a lot of blood.
What do you got?
Weapons were nine millimeters.
The tire tracks out front...
look like a Humvee.
Ravenwood.
<i>But why?
What would they want here?</i>
Whatever they wanted,
Mimi wasn't supposed to survive.
<i>What do we do?</i>
Gather the rangers at the med center.
She needs protection.
Ravenwood does not get near her.
Major.
Tell the other squad to get moving.
We'll rendezvous in 30.
What is it?
There was a shooting
out at Richmond Farm.
- I heard from Goetz already.
- What'd he say?
Said he went out on J&R business,
someone opened fire on him,
killed three of his men.
You believe that?
Do you know something I don't?
There's a survivor.
- She's unconscious but when she...
- Sir, we're ready and standing by.
- I'm sorry, Jake, I've got to go.
- Where are you going?
20 minutes ago, a pipe bomb went
off outside the J&R office in New Bern.
Took out six of my men.
I'll be back in 12 hours.
- It's not going to wait 12 hours.
- It's going to have to.
Things are coming apart at
the seams in New Bern right now.
And you have my word,
tomorrow I'm going to get into this,
but for tonight I'm trusting that
you can keep things under control here.
That means Goetz is off limits.
No threats,
no retribution, no exceptions.
Do you understand?
<i>One entrance.</i>
<i>Small exit.</i>
Is she going to be okay?
I'm going to need this room clear now.
- Please.
- Come on. Come on.
Beck's gone to New Bern.
We're on our own.
Bill, Marty,
you take the front.
<i>Greg and Dave, you take the back.</i>
Any sign of Goetz,
you let me know
before you do anything, all of you.
Stan.
- Taking her to the morgue?
- Yeah.
I'm going.
He shouldn't be alone.
I'll keep an eye on him.
They just checked Mimi Clark into
the medical center for a gunshot wound.
She was in the house?
<i>Mrs. Hawkins, here's your prescription.</i>
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Well, everyone under the age of 18
in your house is running a fever, and...
<i>Jake!</i>
Jake!
Goetz is outside.
Stay here.
Jake.
I understand Mimi Clark is inside.
I'm going to need to see her.
Jake, don't do something stupid.
Mimi Clark is a witness to
the killings of three of my men.
She may have even
been one of the shooters.
- She's got some questions to answer.
- You not getting inside this building.
Then I think we have a problem.

www.All-about-Subs.fr</i>
Be very careful about this decision
you're making, Jake.
Because if you kill
a Ravenwood contractor,
Cheyenne will classify this town
as an insurgent enclave.
When they crack down, everyone suffers.
<i>You don't want that.</i>
Then it looks like it's going
to be a long night.
Is this a road you
really want to go down?
You come inside this building
you'll find out.
<i>Thank you, ma'am. We'll get back
to you at 0200 with another update.</i>
<i>Red One out.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>
Heather.
Russell?
How did you get in here?
It wasn't easy.
We had to slip past the
checkpoints and armed patrols.
Things are bad in New Bern, Heather.
And you are making matters worse for us.
What are you talking about?
The resistance in New Bern
has placed a bounty on your head.
We were sent to collect it.
Is there a place we can talk?
So based on this report,
I'd say you were
a former J&R employee, right?
Looking to make sure the
company's sins are exposed.
<i>Something like that.</i>
So why not just blow the whistle?
- What do you need me for?
- <i>I don't need you.</i>
<i>I need your bomb.</i>
<i>It's concrete evidence
that cannot be refuted</i>
<i>as easily as words on a page.</i>
<i>Taking on both J&R and the Cheyenne
government will require nothing less.</i>
And how high up is the connection
between the two of them?
<i>How high do you think?</i>
I think Valente.
<i>Think bigger.</i>
You mean the president?
<i>Ten years ago John Tomarchio
was a young star</i>
<i>within the Jennings & Rall Corporation.</i>
<i>The company was a major donor to
his first campaign for elected office.</i>
<i>His cabinet,</i>
his advisers,
<i>all littered with former J&R employees.</i>
<i>At the highest levels,
that government and this company</i>
<i>are one and the same.</i>
The barricades are about halfway there.
Another ten mi...
I guess we knew this was coming.
<i>Let's get the other barricades done now.</i>
<i>We don't have much time.</i>
I need an extra pair of hands.
Someone to hold a light.
All my guys are on the doors.
Excuse me, madam...
- Darcy.
- You're hired.
Armed civilians, possibly hostages, sir.
Four hours, copy that.
Thank you, sir.
Looks like it's just going
to be the 12 of us for awhile.
Should we start planning for a breech?
<i>Or should we just go to phase two?</i>
By the time Beck gets back here
this thing will be over and done with.
Let's start banging on some doors.
Got it.
Is she okay?
Well, she has been shot.
The bullet entered
the pectoralis musculature,
and missed the subclavean
vessels and the chest cavity.
I'm sorry,
I have no idea what any of that means.
It means, all things considered,
this situation
could have been a lot worse.
Eleven blade, please.
Hey, Stanley.
Stanley, this isn't your fault.
What are you talking about?
Well, when...
when April died...
all I could think about was
I hadn't done enough, that...
that it was my fault.
When my parents died I did that.
I... I blamed myself.
I hated myself for being alive.
But there was this little
girl to take care of.
I sort of pulled myself out of it.
I know.
This is harder.
Your parents, that...
that was an accident...
an act of God.
Aren't they all?
I don't blame myself.
Jake.
<i>What? What is it?</i>
I don't know, but Goetz is getting out.
He's got someone with him.
Fred.
Hello.
Gary, it's your wife.
Hello.
Hey.
Okay, okay. All right, calm down.
Yeah. Okay. All right.
I love you, too.
It's Chloe.
She's outside.
They just went into
the house and got her.
Look, I'm with you guys.
I am, but...
She's scared out of her mind.
You should go.
- It's just that she's out...
- It's all right.
Go.
It's okay, Gary.
They're going after our families?
D?
Darcy?
Hey!
D?
Mr. Hawkins?
Can I help you?
Is it all right if we come in?
Well...
We stopped by a half hour ago.
I guess you weren't home yet.
What can I do for you?
Sir, are you related to
Darcy Hawkins?
Yeah.
What's happened?
All right,
a group of armed men
has taken control of the medical center.
We believe she's among
the hostages inside.
Really?
Okay, so...
what can I do?
Well, we need you to come
down and talk to her on the phone.
Just try to convince her to leave
a very dangerous situation.
I don't understand.
If she's being held hostage, how can
me talking to her get her out of there?
We'll explain all of that on scene,
but...
we do need to go now.
Okay.
Okay. I'm parked out front.
I just... Let me just get my keys.
Sir?
It would be best if
you just came with us.
Okay.
Where is my wife?
Hey, Mimi.
Where am I?
You're at the med center.
You're going to be fine.
Where are Stanley and Bonnie?
The nurse...
She'll be back in a minute.
I told her I'd keep an eye on you.
Let me go get her.
Wait, please.
Where's Stanley?
Stanley's downstairs.
And Bonnie?
I'm sorry.
As soon as Beck declared us the
aggressors in the fight with Jericho,
he put us in a choke hold.
Curfews, military courts,
armed checkpoints.
The resistance came
together soon after that.
For weeks, we were a step ahead of him.
Then, all of a sudden,
he was on to us.
Some of those tips
you've been giving Beck,
they've made things very difficult
for us.
They've cost us lives.
The moment Constantino figured
out it was you, he issued the bounty.
So wait a minute.
You're working with Constantino?
Russell, he's a murderer.
You think I don't know that?
A lot of reasonable people
are lining up behind him.
Beck's left us no alternative.
So, if you came to kill me,
why am I still alive?
I came here to convince you
to stop doing what you're doing.
And to bring back a little trophy.
What kind of trophy?
Goetz.
Will you go up and check on Mimi for me?
Don't you think we should both go up?
I'll be right up. Just...
give me a minute or two.
Thanks.
I know, I know...
I love you.
What are you doing here?
We're switching posts?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Who is it?
Jimmy, open the door.
Mr. Hawkins?
Yeah.
I come bearing gifts.
We've got 12 men. From the looks
of it, they've got about the same.
They've got three less
than they had before.
And that one will come in handy if they
try and threaten anybody else's family.
- They tried to use you as bait?
- They tried.
- Where's my wife, Jake?
- She's helping with Mimi.
Tell me what the hell's going on here.
We did a sweep of the area.
We found Burke and
Sloan by the rear entrance.
- They're dead.
- Dead?
- What about Stanton and Bulger?
- Still no sign of them.
All right, do another sweep.
I want to know what's going on.
Fred.
You okay?
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.
Yeah. Why don't...
why don't you go get some water?
Yeah. Thank you.
Hey.
Where's Stanley?
He's with Bonnie.
He'll be up soon.
Excuse me.
Do you have any idea why
all this might be happening?
Because Goetz is embezzling
money from
Jennings & Rall.
I have the proof, my ledger.
Killing civilians they can excuse,
but you put your hands in their pocket,
suddenly J&R's a lot less forgiving.
Zero tolerance.
My ledger was at the house.
I'm sure he has it by now.
Is there any way to
recreate that information?
If you had access to the system?
Maybe.
Hawkins.
I need your help.
Isn't that what I've been doing?
Well, this is a little bit different.
It's outside the scope
of our usual conversation.
I have to be very careful
about sticking my neck out
when, where
and for whom.
Now, listen to me.
I don't know what
it is you want from me,
but I know you are not feeding
me information for my own benefit.
So I will promise you this
if you do not do this favor for me,
then our relationship will end
right here and right now.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Is there anyone in the J&R
office that you think you can trust?
Why?
Because we need to reconstitute
the information from that ledger.
Now, is there anyone that
could help you to do that?
Well, there is someone.
Good. Make the call.
What do you want me to tell her?
Tell herto gather all the information
and send it to this address.
This is the personal e-mail
for the director of operations
of Ravenwood. How did you get this?
Don't ask.
Jake.
We got a problem.
Are you all right?
He came at me out of nowhere.
Frank, where's your gun?
There's no way he cut through that tape.
No. Not without help.
- One of us.
- Yeah.
Be First, we gotta find
our Ravenwood friend.
How many men have you
got guarding the exits?
Two at each.
But if he starts picking them off,
then Goetz can get in,
and we can't afford to
pull anyone off of Mimi's door.
- Jake, we have got to find him.
- We'll find him,
but after that, we gotta find a way out.
Jake...
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Yeah, pretty sure.
Well, there's a way
that may become useful.
Jimmy. Bill.
You guys are just gonna
snatch Goetz off the street?
Execute him in cold blood?
I got a handful of guys
out looking for him right now.
Russell.
What happened to you?
Goetz executed three of my neighbors
in New Bern a few months ago,
and this government promoted him.
Beck has been strangling
my home town for weeks,
And this same government
tells me that I'm in the wrong.
I've had enough.
We punish Goetz in New Bern,.
And we show Beck that we're
not going away any time soon.
I know things are bad,
but the minute you guys
threw in with Constantino,
you gave up the high ground.
Beck's going to fight you.
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna be helping him do it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Word of advice?
Pray I can get Goetz
because if I don't,
it's not gonna be me that Constantino
sends after you next.
Hello.
<i>Trish.</i>
Mimi?
Trish, Bonnie's dead.
Oh, my God.
<i>What happened?</i>
It was Goetz. And his men.
They killed her for the ledger.
<i>Trish, I need your help.</i>
What can I do?
I hope this works.
It'll work.
Just have to make it a little bigger.
It's too small?
What, you don't think
I can fit through that hole?
You're gonna want to make it bigger.
<i>Go through</i>
the backup folders in that directory.
<i>That's where you'll find the numbers
that Goetz altered.</i>
Okay. I got 'em.
<i>Now what do you want me to do with them?</i>
I'm gonna give you an e-mail address
and a code for the subject line.
Mimi, I am so sorry.
It's not your fault.
Mimi, I am the one who told Goetz.
I know.
Will you do this for me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
Mimi, stop.
I'm so sorry.
No.
I never should have opened my mouth.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
Listen to me.
You were in danger.
Bonnie did what she needed
to do to protect you and...
you're alive.
Wherever she is now...
I swear, she's glad she did it.
Yeah.
What kind of gun?
- What?!
- What kind of gun did Frank have?
Nine millimeter Beretta.
Seven!
Five!
Four! Three! Two!
What do you want to do with him?
You're never getting out of here alive.
All the exits are covered.
Sure about that?
What was all that?
We got a fix on him and traded fire.
Did you get him?
No, he got away.
He's probably still inside.
Let's pull Marty and Dave off
the front entrance to help guard Mimi.
Fred, take their place.
They've been there all night.
They need some rest.
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
Goetz.
The back door is gonna be clear.
Really?
- Five minutes.
- Got it.
Out.
We're in!
- Tell me what the hell's going on here.
- They're gone, sir.
I can see that. Where'd they go?
I don't know. Another exit
somewhere off near the pharmacy.
There are no exits over there.
Sir,
I think you should see this.
- What the hell's through this hole?
- Farm equipment store.
Apparently, it's all one structure.
It doesn't make any sense.
Got the whole perimeter covered.
Didn't say anything to me about this.
No kidding.
They made you for the mole, genius.
I heard them say something
about moving the woman to her farm.
Hide her there until Beck returns.
What do you want us to do?
Mount up.
Redirect the reinforcements
to the Route 23 junction.
- Catch up with them on the move.
- Let's go.
Are they gone?
- Jake, wait.
- Are they gone?
All clear.
Let's go.
Jake,
Jake, I had no choice.
He said he'd take my farm.
He threatened my wife.
Go home, Fred.
- Jake, please...
- Go home, Fred.
Go home.
Jake, they've got reinforcements coming.
They said they're meeting a
hundred Ravenwood men at the crossroads.
8:00 a.m. At Route 23
and Cherry Valley Road.
Let's go.
Hey, not yet.
Check your mags.
Are those reinforcements?
No.
Watch this.
I'm Director Jamison,
Ravenwood Regional HQ.
All you guys saddle up.
We're moving out.
Sir, I'm in the middle
of an operation here.
No, you're not.
Take their rifles!
Let's move!
Where we going?
They're being redeployed.
You're fired.
What are you talking about?
You can't fire me.
No, I can't, but he can.
In fact, he already did.
Feel better?
I hope you rot in hell.
Leave 'em here.
They can walk back.
Roll out!
Now?
Yeah, now.
Goetz!
Goetz!
Goetz, I want to see your hands!
Remember, we need him alive!
No way.
Who is that?!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Hold your fire!
What the hell are you doing here?!
I came for him.
I've had my guys tracking him all night,
waiting for their chance
to make the grab.
- Thanks.
- No way, Russell.
You can't have him.
Want to bet?
- I'm handing him over to Beck.
- Handing him over?
If he winds up dead,
Beck will wreak havoc
on both these towns.
He has three killings
to answer for in New Bern.
Yeah, well, he's in Jericho,
and he's under arrest
for Bonnie Richmond's murder.
We're fighting an army
that has more guns than we do,
more men than we do.
What we need is resolve.
And Goetz,
he's the fuel for that resolve.
Stanley.
Stanley.
Stanley.
Stay back.
Jake, that doesn't matter.
Whether Goetz goes missing
or his body's found,
Beck is gonna put the pieces together.
You know he will.
The minute that body hit the ground,
this became
a whole different deal.
So what's your status, Cap?
<i>This sector's clear, sir.</i>
<i>No sign of insurgent activity.</i>
Roger that. Out.
- What is it?
- Sir...
you're gonna want
to see this for yourself.
<i>A˛S Team

<i>Précédemment dans Jericho...</i>
<i>Tous les États de l'ouest</i>
sont alliés à Cheyenne.
Ils sont forts
et le deviennent de plus en plus.
Le Texas est sur le point
de signer avec Cheyenne.
Si ça arrive, la partie est finie.
J'ai une des bombes...
Je t'ai mis la liste de mes contacts,
je t'appellerai.
- Pourquoi avez-vous besoin de moi ?
- <i>J'ai besoin de votre bombe.</i>
<i>C'est une preuve tangible
et irréfutable.</i>
Mimi, voici Trish Merrick,
elle bosse pour <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.
<i>Je suis si contente</i> de vous avoir
parmi nous, vous n'imaginez pas.
On a un écart de 10 000 dollars.
Quelqu'un les a pris.
<i>Je suis administrateur en chef</i> de
cette ville et je veux votre registre.
Bonnie, c'est ça ?
Mimi Clark est-elle là ?
C'était Goetz et ses hommes.
<i>Ils l'ont tuée pour le registre.</i>
<i>Goetz est hors de contrôle.</i>
Pas de menaces, pas de vengeance,
pas d'exception.
Goetz, je veux voir tes mains !
Souvenez-vous, il nous le faut vivant !
S'il apprend sa mort,
Beck déclenchera un déluge
de représailles sur nos villes.
<i>Beck remontera notre piste.</i>
À la minute où ce corps a touché le sol,
<i>la donne a totalement changé.</i>
- Les hommes sont prêts ?
- Ils sont en position.
Ils sont briefés sur les cibles
et les objectifs, Monsieur.
Ils ont eu leur chance.
Repos, Messieurs.
Vous savez tous qui nous cherchons.
Ramenez-les ici.
<i>- Rien !
- Personne !</i>
Que faites-vous ?
Ce bar est un repaire d'insurgés.
Je vais le retourner jusqu'à trouver
le responsable du meurtre de John Goetz.
Ils ne sont pas là.
Je ne sais pas où ils sont.
Vraiment ? Même pas Eric Green ?
Je n'ai vu personne
depuis le meurtre de Bonnie.
<i>Major,</i>
une porte verrouillée dans les cuisines.
C'est une réserve.
Il n'y a que des cacahuètes
et des bretzels.
Soit vous l'ouvrez,
soit nous détruisons une bonne porte.
Mes gosses doivent être morts de peur.
Je devrais être à la maison.
Ils surveillent déjà nos maisons, Jimmy.
Te faire arrêter
ne les aidera pas.
On devrait aller plaider notre cas
face à Beck.
Goetz était un assassin.
Il fallait le faire.
Malheureusement, Beck a dit :
"Pas de meurtres de vengeance".
Il n'abandonnera pas.
Où vas-tu ?
Me rendre.
Non, Stanley !
- Lâche-moi !
- Ça ne sert à rien.
Tu restes ici avec nous.
- C'est tout ce qu'il y a à faire.
- Laissez-moi y aller, s'il vous plaît.
Beck n'a pas mis longtemps
à comprendre ce qui est arrivé à Goetz.
D'après la rumeur, il ne semble pas
avoir toutes les données.
Il sait que les rangers étaient là,
mais il ne doit pas savoir
que j'y étais aussi.
Et je ne crois pas
qu'il sache qui a tiré.
Ce n'est pas le plus important.
On ne peut pas
rester ici indéfiniment...
et lever une armée non plus.
Je sais que tu veux protéger ton ami,
mais ça ne fera qu'empirer
jusqu'à ce que Beck arrête le tireur.
Il n'y a qu'une chose à faire.
C'est un bon début.
Où sont les autres ?
C'est moi, le responsable,
et personne d'autre.
- Je suis le shérif...
- Vous l'étiez.
Je suis le seul en cause.
Le seul...
donc mes conditions sont simples :
ma reddition
contre l'amnistie des autres rangers.
J'accepte votre reddition...
mais pas le reste.
Non !

Vous m'avez, vous voulez quoi de plus ?
La vérité serait un bon début.
J'ai tué Goetz.
- Vous mentez.
- Non, il me gênait.
Je sais que les rangers et vous avez
engagé une fusillade avec Ravenwood,
tuant plusieurs hommes
en légitime défense.
Je sais que vous avez cerné
et désarmé Goetz.
Je sais que vous avez tenté
de procéder à son arrestation.
Et je sais que Stanley Richmond
l'a assassiné ensuite.
Où allez-vous chercher ça ?
Je le sais de source sûre.
Il a tué la soeur de mon meilleur ami.
- Elle avait 18 ans.
- Je sais.
Et ça mettait fin
à une longue série de meurtres.
- Il devait rendre des comptes.
- Vous n'êtes pas juge.
Ce n'était pas à vous de décider.
Dites-moi où trouver Stanley
et tout sera terminé.
Je ne vais pas vous le donner.
Si c'est ce que vous attendez,
on va rester ici très longtemps.
Amenez-le.
Votre ami Russell.
Il a dit la même chose...
mais tout le monde craque...
au final.
Et jusqu'à ce que ça vous arrive,
vous ne sortirez pas de ces 4 murs.
Vous ne dormirez pas...
tant que je ne le déciderai pas.
Vous ne mangerez pas
tant que je ne le dirai pas.
Vous allez me donner ce que je veux.
Je reviens dans 24 heures.
- Beck a emmené Jake.
- Quoi ?
Où ?
Je ne sais pas.
Jake s'est rendu, ils lui ont mis
un sac sur la tête et l'ont embarqué.
Je ne crois pas
qu'on soit en sécurité ici.
- Jake ne parlera pas.
- Ce ne sera pas nécessaire.
À la vitesse où va Beck,
il nous trouvera en quelques jours.
Stanley avait peut-être raison.
S'il se livre,
Beck ne détruira pas la ville.
- Personne ne livrera Stanley.
- Et on ne laisse pas tomber Jake.
On continue à négocier.
On a besoin
d'un moyen de pression sur Beck.
Que tout le monde s'équipe.
On campe ?
Oui, Sam,
mais juste quelques jours.
Cet endroit a une drôle d'odeur.
Sam, range tes affaires dans la chambre.
Viens, je vais te montrer.
Oui ?
<i>Prêt à venir au Texas ?</i>
- Chavez ?
- <i>Oui</i>.
Qui d'autre ça pourrait être ?
Le Texas est prêt à nous écouter ?
Ils ont envie de l'entendre.
Mais le Texas est sur le point
de rejoindre Cheyenne.
Si l'alliance se fait,
les États-Unis seront
de l'histoire ancienne.
Mes contacts disent
qu'ils n'attendront pas longtemps.
Tu dois vite apporter le paquet ici.
Je t'envoie les coordonnées.
Je serai là le plus vite possible.
Ce ne sera pas si simple.
Cheyenne a des barrages partout.
Hawkins, tu es toujours là ?
Je pense avoir une solution.
Bien reçu.
Fais le plus vite possible.
Je ne sais pas
s'ils attendront longtemps.
J'ai dit que je serais là.
Va voir ce qu'il se passe là-bas !
Vous allez dégager ça de la route ?
Je sais que vous m'entendez.
Oui...
<i>Écoutez,
nous aurions besoin d'une faveur.</i>
Désolé pour tout ça.
<i>À terre !</i>
On a besoin de votre camion.
C'est bon !
<i>Baissez vos armes !
Les mains bien visibles !</i>
Major,
nous savons pourquoi le convoi
de ravitaillement est en retard.
Alors ?
On a trouvé ça sur le capot
d'une jeep désossée au checkpoint 0.
<i>On a votre essence,
vos armes et vos munitions.</i>
On les échangera contre le shérif Green.
Levez-le.
Je veux
que vous signiez quelque chose.
C'est une lettre de vous
pour vos rangers,
où vous refusez toute tactique
visant à obtenir votre libération.
Vos amis...
ont aggravé la situation
au point que je ne puisse le tolérer.
Ils mettent leur vie en danger
par loyauté pour vous.
C'est vraiment ce que vous voulez ?
Nous savons tous les deux
où ça nous mènera, Jake.
Finissons-en maintenant.
Acceptez de signer cette lettre.
Dites-moi où se trouve Stanley.
Mon offre d'amnistie en échange
de Stanley Richmond est annulée.
Les rangers sont désormais considérés
comme des fugitifs.
Je les veux tous.
Bonne chance pour les trouver.
Tant qu'ils ne se montrent pas,
je déclare Jéricho
en insurrection ouverte.
<i>Allez ! Allez !</i>
Tout en bas dans le coin.
L'électricité, les vivres...
à 21 h ce soir, je coupe tout.
On a survécu sans tout ça avant,
on le refera.
<i>Ne bougez pas !</i>
Vous voulez vraiment me tester ?
Vous voulez voir
jusqu'où je peux aller ?
<i>Reculez !</i>
<i>Reculez derrière cette ligne !</i>
<i>Reculez, tout le monde !</i>
<i>Quoi qu'il arrive...</i>
<i>à partir de maintenant,</i>
n'oubliez jamais...
que c'est votre faute.
<i>Reculez ! Reculez !</i>
Oui ?
<i>Hawkins ?</i>
Oui.
<i>Qu'est-ce que j'entends
à propos du Texas ?</i>
Je ne sais pas.
À vous de me le dire.
<i>J'ai des contacts
au sein du gouvernement texan.</i>
<i>Vous leur avez promis la bombe,
n'est-ce pas ?</i>
Non,
je n'ai rien promis à personne.
<i>Cette bombe est la clé</i>
<i>pour faire tomber
ce gouvernement et ils le savent.</i>
<i>Ils ne vous laisseront jamais
la transporter au Texas.</i>
Alors, selon vous,
je devrais faire quoi ?
<i>Je vous ai trouvé
une destination sûre près de chez vous,</i>
<i>un lieu lié notre cause.</i>
<i>On pourra examiner la bombe là-bas,</i>
<i>pour prouver nos dires
sans se risquer à passer la frontière.</i>
Où est cette "destination sûre" ?
<i>Donnez-moi du temps pour finaliser
et je vous contacterai pour le lieu.</i>
Combien de temps ?
<i>Une journée. Deux, tout au plus.</i>
OK...
John Smith.
Quand pars-tu ?
Maintenant.
Garde les enfants à l'abri
jusqu'à ce que tout se calme.
Dis-moi que tu as un plan brillant,
Robert, pour transporter cette chose...
jusqu'au Texas
sans qu'on vérifie ton camion.
Tu as volé un tee-shirt ?
- C'est ton plan.
- Non.
J'ai aussi volé un camion.
Les employés de <i>J&R</i>
ont un laissez-passer pour les barrages.
Dis-moi maintenant
que tu as un plan pour revenir ici ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Je pense que c'est évident.
Pas d'électricité, pas d'eau,
pas de vivres...
un embargo total, si ces hommes
ne sont pas en détention d'ici ce soir.
Je vous ai défendu contre tous.
La durée et le degré de souffrance de
cette ville dépendent de ses citoyens.
Quelqu'un sait
où se trouvent ces hommes.
Les rangers sauvaient des vies, pendant
que vous cherchiez Jericho sur un plan.
Ils ont assuré l'ordre,
repoussé les pilleurs,
organisé la lutte contre New Bern.
Les gens ne les laisseront pas tomber.
Quelles que soient leurs raisons,
ce gouvernement ne peut
tolérer l'insurrection.
Vous vous rappelez la question
que vous m'avez posée
quand vous m'avez offert ce boulot
et que je ne le voulais pas.
Vous aviez demandé si je pouvais
vous différencier de Constantino.
Là, je ne peux pas.
Alors, aidez-moi.
Parlez à Jake.
Faites-lui comprendre
ce qu'il fait à cette ville.
Vous le détenez depuis 3 jours.
Ce n'est pas sa faute,
c'est la vôtre.
Je ne sais pas si je peux continuer
à prendre votre défense.
<i>Il n'y a plus beaucoup de cerfs.</i>
<i>Il n'y a plus beaucoup de cerfs.</i>
<i>Il n'y a plus beaucoup de cerfs.</i>
Je crois que le réchauffement climatique
les a poussés vers le nord.
Je ne sais pas
si je peux supporter plus, grand-père.
Ils essaient de t'affaiblir.
L'esprit d'un homme ne fonctionne
pas très bien sans sommeil.
Brisez le moral d'un homme,
il vous donnera
tout ce que vous voulez.
Comme ils ont essayé avec toi, à Anzio.
Tu sais que les Allemands
ont capturé plus de 400 d'entre nous
dans une embuscade.
Comment t'en es-tu sorti ?
J'ai pensé à mon foyer.
J'ai pensé à ta grand-mère.
Mais ce qui m'a vraiment obligé
à me dépasser,
c'était de savoir que je devais protéger
la vie des hommes de mon unité.
La seule chose
dont tu dois te rappeler
est que ces gens dépendent de toi.
Tu as vu Stanley ?
Il est avec Eric et Emily.
Comment va-t-il ?
Il ne parle... à personne.
Emmène-moi le voir.
- Tu es blessée, tu ne devrais pas...
- Je peux faire ce que je veux.
S'il te plaît...
Conduis-moi à Stanley.
<i>Explique-moi ceci... explique...</i>
Explique-moi.
J'ai fait du mal à mes proches et
j'ai eu une 2nde chance, mais Stanley...
Stanley n'a jamais
fait de mal à personne de sa vie.
- Et il a tout perdu.
- Ce n'est pas juste...
La vie ne l'est pas...
C'est un équilibre, mais elle devrait.
Et ta punition consiste
à t'asseoir dans ce trou et mourir.
Comment ça pourrait ramener Bonnie ?
Ou le Stanley que tu as connu ?
Ou la petite fille d'Irak ?
C'est un début.
C'est une fin. <i>C'est une fin.</i>
- <i>Quel choix me reste-t-il ?</i>
- Quel choix me reste-t-il ?
La réponse, c'est Beck.
Je ne sais pas
par où commencer avec lui.
Et il trop têtu pour écouter.
Ton père a dit la même chose de toi.
Et tu es devenu charmant.
Il ne s'agit pas
de convaincre un homme qu'il a tort.
- C'est... c'est tout un système.
- Tu penses que c'est impossible.
Tout ça s'est déjà produit.
Si le nom n'était pas "Jennings & Rall",
ce serait des noms comme...
"La Compagnie britannique
des Indes orientales".
Si ce n'était pas Ravenwood,
ce serait les mercenaires Hessiens.
<i>Mercenaires</i>.
<i>Et tout ça aboutit</i>
<i>au même résultat...
au même résultat.</i>
Révolution.
<i>Révolution.</i>
- Je t'aime.
- Ne dis pas ça.
- C'est vrai.
- Non.
Stanley, regarde-moi.
- On va s'en remettre.
- Je ne veux pas m'en remettre.
Je sais, c'est ce que
tu ressens en ce moment, mais...
Que vais-je faire ?
Retourner à la ferme ?
Je vais nourrir les poulets,
organiser le mariage ?
Bonnie est morte...
et j'ai tué un homme.
Rien ne va changer ça, rien.
Ouais.
<i>- Je croyais qu'on avait un accord.</i>
- C'est le cas.
<i>Alors, pourquoi allez-vous au Texas ?</i>
Comment savez-vous
que je vais au Texas ?
<i>Je suis bien renseigné.</i>
<i>Si vous pensez que vous pouvez le faire
sans mon aide, vous faites erreur.</i>
<i>Je connais les rouages de J&R
mieux que quiconque.</i>
<i>Donc faites demi-tour.</i>
<i>On peut faire l'histoire ensemble,
vous et moi.</i>
Je suis désolé de vous décevoir.
<i>J'espérais
qu'on travaillerait ensemble,</i>
<i>mais je trouverai
une autre solution.</i>
Ouais.
Lors des attaques du 11 septembre et...
que Washington a été détruite avec tout
ce que je connaissais...
je ne pensais pas survivre à tout ça.
Je ne pouvais plus respirer
et tout était devenu noir.
Et puis, je t'ai trouvé.
Les attaques étaient contre nous.
Quelqu'un d'autre
a appuyé sur la détente.
Ouais. Et Goetz a tué Bonnie.
- Tout le monde comprend ton geste.
- Ces... ces...
ces mains étaient liées.
Il n'allait nulle part.
Il m'a regardé et je me souviens
que je me suis dit : "c'est...
c'est juste un homme."
Je veux dire, tout le truc,
la traque de Goetz, Goetz le tueur.
C'était juste un homme.
C'était juste que...
je m'en moquais,
et je n'étais...
je n'étais pas effrayé,
je n'étais pas en colère.
J'ai juste appuyé sur la détente.
C'est ce que j'ai fait.
E.J. Green,
soldat de l'armée américaine,
1942-1945.
Johnston Green,
soldat de l'armée américaine,
1969-1976.
Votre père et votre grand-père
ont été de grands soldats,
les miens aussi.
Je sais à quel point c'est difficile
d'être à la hauteur de l'héritage.
Il est dit ici que les deux...
sont devenus maires.
Pensez-vous qu'ils auraient soutenu
les citoyens de cette ville
en retournant la loi de votre côté ?
<i>Avancez.</i>
Ils n'auraient jamais laissé
les choses aller aussi loin.
Excusez-moi ?
Ils n'auraient jamais...
confié la ville à des mercenaires.
Ils n'avaient pas à faire
ce que je fais,
empêcher des Américains
de tuer des Américains,
remettre un pays sur ses pieds.
Ouvrez les yeux.
Ce n'est pas un pays,
c'est une compagnie.
Et vous êtes juste
un cadre intermédiaire.
Les gens de Jericho
vont récupérer cette ville.
Vous allez avoir une révolte
sur les bras.
Arrêtez !
Ça ne donne rien.
Il s'enfonce.
- On passe à l'étape suivante.
- Oui, Monsieur. Monsieur.
Il y a aussi un appel pour vous.
On l'a transféré.
Major Beck à l'appareil.
<i> J'ai des informations
sur la terroriste que vous recherchez.</i>
Qui êtes-vous ?
<i> Je sais que vous pensez rechercher
Sarah Mason,</i>
<i>mais elle est morte
depuis plusieurs mois.</i>
<i>Regardez votre fax.</i>
Qui est à l'appareil ?
<i>Le terroriste avec qui elle travaillait
l'a tuée.</i>
<i>Son nom est Robert Hawkins...</i>
<i>et il a une bombe nucléaire.</i>
<i>Jake.</i>
<i>Chéri.</i>
Mon bébé.
Regarde-moi, mon coeur.
Maman.
Maman, que fais-tu là ?
On m'a dit
que tu avais quelques soucis.
Là,
prends un verre d'eau.
Allez, chéri.
Voilà. Doucement.
Voilà.
C'est bien. Ça va ?
Mon coeur, tu ne peux pas continuer ça,
je ne peux pas te laisser comme ça.
Il doit y avoir un autre moyen.
Maman, tu ne devrais pas être là.
Maintenant, écoute-moi.
Tu vas juste dire au major Beck
ce qu'il veut savoir, s'il te plaît,
- et après, il te relâchera.
- Non, maman.
Non.
Je t'aime, fiston.
Eric et les gars arrivent.
Je t'aime. Reste vigilant.
N'abandonne pas.
Maman ?
Maman ?
<i>Ici Delta 9. J'ai un visuel.</i>
<i>Virage pour approche.</i>
<i>Fox 1, Fox 2, il est dans les arbres.</i>
<i>On vous attend pour le débusquer
de l'autre côté.</i>
J'ai passé le message à Jake.
- Je veux une carte.
- Où est-il retenu ?
Non, j'avais les yeux bandés,
je ne voyais rien,
mais je crois pouvoir
vous aider à le trouver.
OK, Beck m'a emmené dans un 4x4
et il a tourné à droite
après Main Street
et on a continué jusqu'à traverser
le pont Tacoma,
ce qui signifie qu'on allait
vers le sud-est.
Et après, tout droit pendant
presque 20 min,
puis on a pris un chemin de gravier
à gauche.
Je crois qu'on était à la ferme Levine,
mais la route était comme...
des montagnes russes d'un coup,
chaotiques, comme des rails de trains.
Ça semble être la 48,
entre Alex-Bell et Lytle Five-Points.
Ça fait au moins 5 km².
Bon, tu te souviens d'autre chose ?
Il y avait une odeur terrible.
La ferme Hog.
C'est bien ici qu'ils retiennent Jake.
2 gardes à la porte,
avec M4 et armes de poing.
Un 4x4, un chauffeur, c'est ça.
Bon,
on attend quoi ?
On va le chercher.
<i>Cible en vue.</i>
Faucon 0-6, ici Fox 2.
On a trouvé le paquet.
<i>Reçu, Fox 2.</i>
Jake, allez viens !
Aide-moi !
<i>Couvrez-nous !</i>
<i>- Montez-le.</i>
- Doucement.
C'est bon, tu es là maintenant.
<i>Allez ! Allez !</i>
<i>Vous vous en êtes sorti.</i>
Vous savez, vous auriez dû attendre
le jour pour tenter de m'avoir.
J'aurais pu avoir moins de chance.
Je regrette que ça en soit arrivé là,
mais vous m'avez laissé peu de choix.
Vous avez un problème maintenant.
Vous avez montré votre jeu.
Vous ne saviez pas seulement
où j'allais, mais exactement où j'étais.
Et ça signifie que vous me pistiez.
<i>Comment aurais-je pu faire ça ?</i>
Je crois que c'est là
que ça devient intéressant,
parce que ce téléphone est sécurisé.
Et la voiture, volée.
Alors, le seul moyen que vous aviez...
c'était d'avoir un mouchard
à l'intérieur de la bombe.
<i>- Vous êtes parano.</i>
- Ouais,
c'est possible.
Mais il y a 14 ans,
c'est vous qui avez rédigé
le rapport détaillant
comment une attaque terroriste
nucléaire massive
pourrait décapiter
le gouvernement fédéral, non ?
Et dans ce rapport,
vous avez établi qu'un individu
ayant les bons accès
pourrait générer cette attaque.
Notez qu'il soit logique que quiconque
ait mis ces bombes dans la nature
aurait implanté un mouchard dans chacune
de ces bombes afin de savoir
où elles se trouvaient.
Vous...
prêchiez pour votre paroisse.
Vous connaissiez le système... Merde !
C'était vous,
vous avez rédigé ce plan.
Et ensuite, je pense
que c'est vous
qui avez mis le plan à exécution.
Vous n'êtes pas juste
un informateur innocent.
N'est-ce pas ?
<i>Je crois que je le suis.</i>
<i>Seulement, la dernière fois
que j'ai dénoncé un fait,</i>
<i>j'ai eu 23 villes américaines.</i>
Monsieur, aucun signe de Jake Green
ou des rangers.
Aucun blessé grave
pendant le raid sur la ferme.
- Et dans le reste de la ville ?
- Trois morts, tous civils.
14 autres blessés, 3 parmi nos gars.
On a 12 personnes arrêtées
pour divers incendies et...
<i>Vous avez tué des millions,</i>
des dizaines de millions de gens.
Pourquoi ?
<i>Pour délivrer ce pays.</i>
<i>Quand j'ai travaillé pour J&R,
j'ai vu comment la corruption</i>
<i>des relations entre la compagnie
et le gouvernement fédéral a évolué.</i>
<i>Prestataire unique,</i>
<i>armée privée,
une société écrivant la législation.</i>
<i>J&R était un cancer grandissant</i>
<i>dans les os du gouvernement.</i>
<i>Alors, j'ai décidé d'éradiquer
ce cancer en un coup.</i>
Eh bien, vous avez échoué.
Parce que <i>J&R</i> est plus puissant
que jamais.
<i>Ils sont aussi plus vulnérables.</i>
<i>J&R et le gouvernement de Cheyenne</i>
<i>sont regroupés
dans une même ville.</i>
<i>Donc quand je porterai le coup final,</i>
<i>le mal sera vraiment éradiqué.</i>
Vous allez attaquer Cheyenne ?
<i>Avec votre bombe.</i>
Mais vous ne l'avez pas.
C'est le gouvernement de Cheyenne
qui l'a.
<i>Je sais exactement comment la reprendre
aux militaires de Cheyenne.</i>
<i>Je finirai alors ce que j'ai commencé.</i>
<i>Je suis désolé qu'on ne puisse
pas le faire ensemble, M. Hawkins.</i>
Écoutez-moi,
je vous avais prévenu
de ce qui arriverait
si vous me mentiez,
si vous essayiez de me manipuler !
Je vais vous renvoyer le problème.
Notre prochaine discussion,
ce ne sera pas au...
... pas au téléphone !
Tout va bien.
Tout va bien.
Rendors-toi.
Depuis combien de temps
je suis dans les vaps ?
Pas assez longtemps.
C'est bon de te voir paisible
pour une fois.
Tu vas bien ?
Ouais.
Darcy et les enfants vont bien ?
Ouais.
Tu nous laisses une minute ?
Ouais.
Jake, j'ai perdu la bombe.
L'armée l'a prise.
Et en ce moment...
elle est en route pour Cheyenne.
Ça signifie quoi pour le Texas ?
Chavez peut les faire poireauter ?
Il n'est plus question de ça.
Jake, l'homme responsable des attaques
de septembre est derrière tout ça.
Et il est certain de pouvoir
récupérer la bombe
et l'utiliser
pour détruire la ville de Cheyenne.
Il y a plus d'un million de personnes
qui y vivent maintenant.
Ouais, un million d'innocentes victimes
parce que tu peux parier
que sa cible, Valente, et les autres...
ils ne seront pas parmi les morts.
Et ça leur donnera une putain d'excuse
pour faire tout ce qu'ils voudront.
Tu sais que si cette bombe est lancée,
nous perdrons ce pays pour toujours,
hein ?
<i>Jennings & Rall</i>...
le gouvernement de Cheyenne...
ils savent qui je suis.
Donc...
il faut que tu sois prêt, parce que
je ne pourrai pas faire ça seul.
Quand part-on ?

<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>
<i>Western states</i> have
all fallen in with Cheyenne.
They're strong
and getting stronger.
Texans are getting close
to siding with Cheyenne.
If that happens,
it's the ball game.
I have one of the bombs.
<i>When I get to Texas</i>
to meet up with my contacts, I'll call.
- <i>Hawkins.</i>
- What do you need me for?
<i>I need your bomb.</i>
<i>It's concrete evidence
that can't be refuted.</i>
Mimi, this is Trish Merrick.
She's with Jennings & Rall.
<i>I'm so glad</i> we have you on board,
I can't even tell you.
There's a $10,000 discrepancy.
Someone took it.
<i>I'm the chief</i> administrator
of this town and I want your ledger.
Bonnie, right?
Is Mimi Clark inside?
It was Goetz. And his men.
<i>They killed her for the ledger.</i>
<i>Goetz is off limits.</i>
No threats, no retribution,
no exceptions.
Goetz, I want to see your hands!
Remember, we need him alive!
If he winds up dead,
Beck will wreak havoc
on both these towns.
Stanley.
<i>Beck is gonna put
the pieces together.</i>
The minute that body hit the ground,
<i>this became a whole different deal.</i>
- Everyone in position?
- Our men are standing by.
They've been fully briefed
on target packages and objectives, sir.
They had their chance.
At ease, gentlemen.
You all know who we're looking
Let's bring 'em in.
- All clear!
- Clear!
<i>What do you</i> think you're doing?
This bar is a haven for Insurgent
activity. I'm gonna turn it upside down
till I find those responsible
for the murder of Goetz.
They're not here.
I don't know where they are.
Even Eric Green?
I haven't seen any of them
since Bonnie was killed.
Major,
- locked door in the kitchen.
- It's a pantry.
There's nothing in there
but peanuts and pretzels.
Either you open it or
we ruin a perfectly good door.
My kids are probably freaking out.
I should be home right now.
They're already watching
our homes, Jimmy.
Getting yourself arrested
isn't gonna help your family.
We should go plead our case to Beck.
Goetz was a murderer.
It had to be done.
Unfortunately,
Beck said no revenge killings.
He's not going to let it go.
- Where are you going?
- Turning myself in.
No, Stanley. Stanley!
- Get off me! Get off me!
- It's not gonna help.
You're staying here with us.
That's all there is to it.
Just let me go, please.
Just let me go.
It didn't take Beck long to
figure out what happened to Goetz.
From the word around town, he
doesn't seem to have the whole picture.
He knows
the Rangers were involved,
doesn't seem to know that I was there.
And I don't think he's figured
out who pulled the trigger.
Well, it doesn't really matter.
We can't stay here forever
and we can't take
on the whole Army.
Jake...
I know you want
to protect your friend,
but this is only going to get
worse until Beck gets the shooter.
There's only one thing to do.
This is a good start.
Where's the rest of 'em?
It's my fault.
And no one else's.
- I'm the sheriff...
- You were sheriff.
I'm the only one to blame.
The only one.
So my terms are simple.
My surrender for the amnesty
of the other Rangers.
I accept your surrender.
But not the terms.
No!
No, no!
<i>No!</i>

"<i>Sedition</i>"
Transcript: <i>Raceman - www.forom.com</i>

<i>A˛S Team
www.All-about-Subs.fr</i>
You got me.
What more do you want?
The truth would be a good start.
I killed Goetz.
- You're lying.
- No. He was my problem.
I know that you and the Rangers
had a shootout with Ravenwood,
killing several men in self-defense.
I know that you subdued
and disarmed Goetz.
I know that you attempted to arrest him.
And I know that Stanley
Richmond then killed him.
Where are you getting all this?
I have a reliable source.
He killed my best friend's sister.
- She was 18 years old.
- I know.
And that was the end
of a long line of murders.
- He needed to be dealt with.
- You're not a judge.
You don't get to make that call.
Tell me where I can find Stanley
and all this will end.
I'm not giving him up.
If that's what you're waiting for you're
going to be here a very long time.
Bring him in.
Your friend Russell.
He said the same thing.
But everybody breaks.
Eventually.
And until you do,
these four walls
will be your entire world.
You will not sleep...
unless I let you.
You will not eat until I feed you.
You will give me what I want.
I'll check back with you in a day.
- Beck took Jake.
- What?
- Where?
- I don't know.
Jake tried to surrender, they put a hood
over his head and they dragged him away.
I don't think it's
safe for us to stay here.
- Jake isn't going to talk.
- He won't have to.
At the rate Beck's going
it'll only be couple of days
before he finds this place.
Maybe Stanley was right.
He turns himself in,
Beck doesn't destroy the town.
- Nobody's turning Stanley in.
- We are not giving up on Jake either.
Now, this is still a negotiation.
What we need is leverage against Beck.
Everybody get your gear.
We're camping?
Yeah, Sam, but just for a few days
This place smells funny.
Sam, put your stuff away in the bedroom.
Come on, I'll show you where
Yeah?
<i>Ready to come to Texas?</i>
- Chavez? <i>- Yeah.</i>
Who else would it be?
Is Texas ready to hear our case?
They're willing to listen.
But Texas is on the verge
of joining Cheyenne.
<i>If those two create an alliance,</i>
<i>the United States is history.</i>
<i>My contacts say
they won't wait long.</i>
<i>You got to get the
package down here now.</i>
I'm sending the coordinates.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
<i>It's not going to be that simple.</i>
<i>Cheyenne has checkpoints
from here to there.</i>
Hawkins, you there?
I think I may have a solution to that.
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Just get here as fast as you can.</i>
I don't know how long
I can keep these guys waiting.
Hey...
I said I'll be there.
See what's going on up there.
Hey! Aren't you guys gonna
get that thing off the road?
Hey, I know you can hear me.
Hey there!
Listen, we need you to do us a favor.
Sorry about this.
<i>Down, get down.</i>
We need your truck.
All clear!
<i>Put down your weapons.
Hands where I can see 'em!</i>
Major,
we learned why the resupply
convoy is so late.
Well?
We found it on the hood of
a dismantled Humvee at Checkpoint Zero.
"We have your gas, guns and ammo.
Will trade for Sheriff Green."
Get him up.
I want you to sign something.
It's a letter, from you to your Rangers,
rejecting their tactics
in trying to secure your release.
Your friends
have been escalating this
to a level I will not tolerate.
They're putting their lives
in danger out of loyalty to you.
Is that really what you want?
We both know where
it goes from here, Jake.
End it right now.
Agree to sign this letter.
Give me Stanley's location.
The offer of amnesty in exchange
for Stanley Richmond is rescinded.
The Rangers are now considered...
fugitives. I want all of them.
Good luck finding them.
Until they're produced,
I'm declaring Jericho
to be in open insurrection.
<i>Go! Go!</i>
<i>All the way down in the corner.</i>
Lights, power, food supplies...
9:00 p.m. Tonight,
I'm shutting it all down.
We've lived without that stuff before,
we'll do it again.
<i>Do not move!</i>
You really want to test me?
You want to see
how far I'll take it?
<i>Move back!</i>
<i>Move back across that line!</i>
<i>Move back, people!</i>
<i>Whatever happens</i>
<i>from here on out,</i>
never forget, you caused it.
<i>Move back! Move back!</i>
Yeah?
<i>Hawkins?</i>
- <i>Yes.
- What's this I hear about Texas?</i>
I don't know. You tell me.
<i>I have contacts inside
the Texas government.</i>
<i>You promised them the bomb, didn't you?</i>
No, I have not promised
anybody anything.
<i>That bomb is the key</i>
<i>to bringing down
this government and they know it.</i>
<i>They'll never let you get it
to Texas.</i>
So what are you saying
I should do?
<i>I've found you a secure destination
closer to home</i>
<i>that's friendly to our cause.</i>
<i>We can examine the bomb there,</i>
<i>prove our case without risking
a border crossing.</i>
Where is this,
"secure destination"?
<i>Give me time to finish the arrangements,
and I'll contact you with the location.</i>
How much time?
<i>A day. Two at the most.</i>
Okay...
John Smith.
When are you leaving?
Now.
Keep the kids out here
till all this blows over.
Please tell me you have some brilliant
plan, Robert, to get this thing
all the way to Texas
with no one checking your trunk.
You stole a shirt?
- That's your plan?
- No.
Stole a truck, too.
See, J&R employees
get a free pass at the checkpoints.
Now please tell me that you have a plan
to get back here.
What is this?
I think it's pretty self-explanatory.
No power, no water,
no food a full embargo
if those men aren't
in my custody by tonight.
I've been defending you
to everyone.
How long or how much this town suffers
is up to its citizens.
Somebody knows where those men are.
The Rangers were saving lives
back when you couldn't
have found Jericho on a map.
They kept order,
fought off raiders,
organized the fight against New Bern.
People won't just give them up.
Whatever their reasons,
this government will not tolerate
insurrection.
You remember the question you asked me
when you offered me this job
and I didn't want it?
You asked me if I couldn't
tell the difference
between you and Phil Constantino.
Right now, I can't.
Then help me.
Talk to Jake yourself.
Get him to realize what
he's doing to this town.
You've had him in custody three days.
He's not doing this,
you are.
I don't know
if I can keep defending you.
<i>Not many deer... not many deer...</i>
<i>Not many deer out here anymore.</i>
<i>Not many deer out here anymore.</i>
I guess global warming has
sent them all north.
I don't know how much
more I can take, Grandpa.
They're just trying
to soften you up.
A man's mind doesn't
work very good without sleep.
Break a man's mind,
he'll give you anything you want.
Like they tried with you at Anzio.
You know, the Germans
captured over 400 of us in that ambush.
How'd you get through it?
I thought about home.
I thought about your grandma.
But the thing that
really got me through it
was knowing that I had to protect
the lives of the men in my unit.
The one thing you have to remember
is that people
are depending on you.
Have you seen Stanley?
He's with Eric and Emily.
How is he?
He's not talking...
to anybody.
Take me to him.
Mimi, you've been shot,
- you really...
- I can do whatever I need to.
Just please...
Take me to Stanley.
<i>Explain this to me... explain...</i>
Explain this to me.
I hurt everybody that was
ever close to me
and I got a second chance,
but Stanley...
Stanley never hurt a soul in his life.
- And he lost everything.
- How is that right?
Life doesn't... Work on a balance sheet,
I know, but it should.
And your punishment
is to sit in this hole and die.
How does that bring back Bonnie?
Or the Stanley you knew?
Or the little girl in Iraq?
T's a start.
It's an ending. <i>It's an ending.</i>
- <i>What choice do I have?</i>
- What choice do I have?
The answer is Beck.
I don't even know
where to start with him.
And he's too stubborn to listen.
Your father said
that about you once.
You turned out real nice.
It's not about convincing
one man he's wrong.
It's a... it's a whole system.
You think it's impossible?
This has all happened before.
If the names weren't Jennings & Rall,
they would be names like
the British East India
Trading Company.
If it wasn't Ravenwood,
it would be the Hessian mercenaries.
<i>Mercenaries.</i>
<i>And it all comes down</i>
<i>to the same thing...
to the same thing.</i>
Revolution.
<i>Revolution.</i>
- I love you.
- Don't.
- I do.
- Don't.
Stanley, look at me.
- We're going to get through this.
- I don't want to get through this.
I know that it must feel
like that right now, but...
What am I gonna do?
Am I gonna go back to the farm?
I'm gonna feed the chickens,
plan a wedding?
Bonnie's dead...
and I killed a man.
Nothing's going to change that,
nothing.
Yeah.
- <i>I thought we had an agreement.</i>
- We did.
<i>Then why are you
on your way to Texas?</i>
How do you know I am
on my way to Texas?
<i>I'm well connected.</i>
<i>If you think you can do this
without my help, you're mistaken.</i>
<i>I know the ins and outs
of J&R better than anyone.</i>
<i>So turn the car around.</i>
<i>We can make history together,
you and I.</i>
I am sorry to disappoint you.
<i>I hoped we could work together,</i>
<i>but I'll just have
to find another way.</i>
Yeah.
When the September
attacks happened and...
D.C. was destroyed along with
everybody and everything I ever knew,
I didn't think I would
ever live through it.
I couldn't breathe,
and everything went black.
And then I found you.
The attacks happened to us.
Somebody else pulled the trigger.
Yeah. And Goetz killed Bonnie.
- Everybody understands what you did.
- Hi-His...
His hands were tied.
He wasn't going anywhere.
He looked at me and I remember
thinking to myself, "This...
this is just some guy."
I mean, all the buildup,
the tracking down Goetz,
Goetz the killer.
He was just some guy.
Everything just, everything...
washed out of me and I wasn't...
I wasn't scared, I wasn't angry.
I just pulled the trigger.
That's what I did.
E.J. Green,
U.S. Army Rangers, 1942-1945.
Johnston Green,
U.S. Army Rangers, 1969-1976.
Both your father and grandfather
were great soldiers.
Mine, too.
I know how hard it can be
to live up to someone else's legacy.
Says here they both...
became mayor.
Do you think they would have supported
the citizens of this town
taking the law
into their own hands?
Move it!
They never would have
let it get that far.
Excuse me?
They would have never...
handed over this town
to a mercenary.
They didn't have
to do what I'm doing,
stopping Americans
from killing Americans,
putting a country back on its feet.
Open your eyes.
It's not a country,
it's a company,
and you're just middle management.
The people of Jericho are
going to take this town back.
You're going to have
a revolt on your hands.
Halt!
It's not working.
He's digging in.
- Next steps.
- Yes, sir.
Sir.
We also have a call for you.
Patched it through.
Yeah, this is Major Beck.
<i>I have information on
a terrorist you're hunting.</i>
Who is this?
<i>I know you think you're
searching for Sarah Mason,</i>
<i>but she's been dead
for a few months.</i>
<i>Look at your fax machine.</i>
Who am I speaking with?
<i>The terrorist she worked
with killed her.</i>
<i>His name is Robert Hawkins...</i>
<i>and he has a nuclear bomb.</i>
<i>Jake.</i>
<i>Honey.</i>
<i>Jake.</i>
Baby.
Jake.
Look at me, sweetheart.
Mom.
Mom, what are you doing here?
I heard you were in
a little bit of trouble.
Here,
have a drink of water.
Come on, honey.
There you go. Careful.
There you go.
That's better. You okay?
Sweetheart,
you can't keep this up
and I can't stand
to see you like this.
There's got to be another way.
Mom, you shouldn't be here.
Now, listen.
You just tell Major Beck
whatever he wants to know, please,
- and then he'll release you.
- No, Mom.
No.
I love you, son.
Eric and the boys are coming.
I love you. Stay alert.
Don't give up.
Mom?
Mom?
<i>This is Delta niner.
I have a visual.</i>
<i>Coming around for approach.</i>
<i>Fox One, Fox Two,
he's in the trees.</i>
<i>We'll wait for you to flush
him out on the other side.</i>
I delivered the message to Jake.
- I need a map.
- Did you see where they took you?
No, I was blindfolded, I couldn't see
a thing, but I can help you find him.
Okay, Beck put me in a Humvee
and we took a right off
of Main Street
and then we just kept on going until
we crossed the Tacoma Bridge,
which means
we were heading southeast.
And then we went straight
for about maybe 20 minutes
and then we took a left
on a gravel road
and I thought we were
at the Levine farm,
but the road felt
bumpy all of a sudden.
Really bumpy. Like railroad tracks.
Sounds like you were out on 48,
between Alex-Bell and Lytle Five-Points.
That's at least five square miles.
Can you remember anything else?
It smelled terrible.
Hog farm.
This is definitely
the place they've got Jake.
Two sentries at the door,
M4s and sidearms.
Humvee, driver, that's it.
Well,
what are we waiting for?
Let's go get him.
<i>Target in sight.</i>
Nighthawk Zero-Six,
this is Fox Two.
We found the package.
<i>Roger that, Fox Two.</i>
Jake, come on!
Help me!
<i>Cover us!</i>
<i>- Get him in.
- Easy.</i>
It's okay, we got you now.
<i>Go! Go!</i>
<i>You escaped.</i>
You know you should have waited
for daylight to try and burn me.
I might not have been so lucky.
<i>I regret it had to come to that,
but you left me little choice.</i>
You've got a problem now.
'Cause you tipped your hand.
You didn't just know where I was going,
you knew exactly where I was.
And that means
you were tracking me.
<i>How would I have done that?</i>
I think that's where it gets
interesting,
because this phone is secure.
And the car was stolen.
So the only way you could've done it...
was to have a tracking
device inside the bomb.
<i>- You sound paranoid.</i>
- Yeah,
well, that just may be.
But 14 years ago,
it was you that wrote
the report detailing
how a massive
nuclear terrorist attack
would decapitate the federal government,
right?
And in that report,
you stated that one individual
with enough access
could mastermind
that entire attack.
See it makes sense that whoever
put those bombs in the field
would have tracking devices
in every single
one of them so he would know
when they were in place.
You
had the axe to grind.
You knew the system... Damn!
It was you who wrote the plan.
And then, I think,
it was you
who put that plan
into practice.
You're not just some
innocent whistle-blower.
Are you?
<i>I believe that I am.</i>
<i>Only the last time
I blew the whistle,</i>
<i>I took out 23 American cities.</i>
Sir, no sign of Jake Green
or the Rangers.
No serious casualties
from the raid of farmhouse.
- What about the rest of the town?
- Three dead, all civilians.
Another 14 wounded,
three of them are ours.
We've got 12 guys in lock
up for various acts of arson and...
<i>You killed millions,</i>
tens of millions of people.
Why?
<i>To liberate this country.</i>
<i>When I worked for J&R,
I saw just how corrupt</i>
<i>the relationship between the company</i>
<i>and the federal government
had become.</i>
<i>No-bid contracts,</i>
<i>a private army,
a corporation that wrote legislation.</i>
<i>J&R was a cancer grown deep</i>
<i>into the bone of this government.</i>
<i>So I decided to remove
that cancer in one fell swoop.</i>
Well, you failed.
Because J&R are more powerful
now than they ever were.
<i>They're also more vulnerable.</i>
<i>J&R and the Cheyenne government</i>
<i>are now centralized in one city.</i>
<i>So when I strike the final blow,</i>
<i>the disease should be gone
for good.</i>
You're going to attack Cheyenne?
<i>With your bomb.</i>
But you don't have it.
The Cheyenne government does.
<i>I know exactly how to get
it back from the Cheyenne military.</i>
<i>And then I'll finish what I started.</i>
<i>I'm just sorry we couldn't
do this together, Mr. Hawkins.</i>
You listen to me,
I told you what would happen
if you ever lied to me,
if you ever tried to play me!
I am going to bring this to you.
The next time we speak,
it will not be...
... not be on this phone!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Go back to sleep.
How long have I been out?
Not long enough.
It's nice seeing you look peaceful
for a change.
You okay?
Yeah.
Darcy and the kids okay?
Yeah.
Give us a minute?
Yeah.
Jake, I lost the bomb.
The Army's got it.
And right now...
... it's on its way to Cheyenne.
What does that mean for Texas?
Can Chavez hold them off?
It's not even about that anymore.
Jake, the man behind the
September attacks is out there.
And he is pretty confident
that he can get that bomb back
and use it to destroy
the city of Cheyenne.
There's over a million
people living there now.
Yeah, a million innocent people
because you can bet that
his target, Valente, and the others...
They will not be among the dead.
And this will just give them the excuse
to do whatever the hell they want to do.
You know, if that bomb goes off,
we will lose this country forever,
right?
Jennings & Rall,
the Cheyenne government
they know who I am.
So...
I need you to be okay, because
I can't do what I've got to do alone.
When do we leave?

Stanley !
Je déclare Jericho...
<i>en insurrection.</i>
<i>Tous les États de l'ouest
sont alliés ŕ Cheyenne.</i>
<i>Le Texas est sur le point

Si ça arrive, la partie est finie.
J'ai une des bombes...
<i>Cette bombe est la clé

<i>Ils ne vous laisseront pas

OK, John Smith.
<i>On a trouvé le paquet.</i>
<i>Vous n'ętes pas juste</i>

<i>La derničre fois
que j'ai dénoncé un fait,</i>
<i>j'ai eu 23 villes américaines.</i>
<i>L'homme responsable</i>
des attaques de septembre
<i>est certain de pouvoir l'utiliser</i>
pour détruire la ville de Cheyenne.
Quand part-on ?
<i>Mary nous a arrangé</i>
un rendez-vous avec un des passeurs
de ce côté du checkpoint,
sur la route 309.
Il devrait pouvoir
nous faire traverser le Wyoming,
avec un peu de chance,
jusqu'ŕ Cheyenne.
On sera seuls ŕ partir de lŕ.
Les rues vont grouiller
de soldats de Cheyenne
et de mercenaires de Ravenwood
en patrouille.
Et comme je suis
l'ennemi public n°1 maintenant,
on aura besoin
d'un endroit sűr rapidement.
- Pourquoi pas ton contact ?
- Qui, Cheung ?
Ouais.
J'ai un moyen de le trouver,
mais ça pourrait prendre du temps.
Il nous faut
quelque chose de plus rapide.
- Écoute, Jake.
- Ouais.
Dčs qu'on partira,
ce sera la mission avant tout.
- Ouais, compris.
- Non, non, écoute...
Je dois en ętre sűr.
J'ai besoin de toi,
mais il faut que tu saches quoi faire.
Une fois partis,
on ne pourra plus palabrer,
donc si tu as des questions,
c'est le moment.
- Oui, j'en ai une.
- Je t'écoute.
Comment retrouve-t-on la bombe ?
Aucune idée. Autre chose ?
<i>L'activité des insurgés
dans votre zone</i>
<i>a atteint
des proportions inacceptables, Major.</i>
<i>Le gouvernement de Cheyenne

<i>Vos ordres sont d'entamer de suite

Monsieur,
avec tout le respect
que je vous dois,
il est prématuré
de passer en phase trois.
Cet endroit est encore récupérable.
<i>Deux prisonniers

<i>Trois convois de provisions

<i>Le temps de la modération est passé.</i>
<i>Vous connaissez vos ordres.</i>
<i>Cette insurrection doit cesser.</i>
Vingt minutes d'introduction,
un tour de table pendant une heure,
deux heures pour le repas,
un millier de maires
en congrčs et boum,
plus de second amendement.
C'est bien plus facile
de pacifier un pays
quand ses citoyens
ont les poings liés.
J'en ai marre qu'on dise
que je m'en fais trop.
On parle de la Constitution,
pas d'un mode d'emploi de la stéréo.
On continuera
ŕ faire entendre nos voix.
Je ne vois pas d'autre choix.
Bonjour, M. le maire.
Comment ça va, Gray ?
Ŕ part la crise cardiaque
que vous venez de me donner ?
Allons marcher, je vous expliquerai.
Oui, je... j'apprécierais.
- Ça a été rapide, non ?
- Quoi donc ?

<i>Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire que
la situation se soit dégradée si vite.</i>
Je ne devrais pas ętre lŕ.
Je perds mon temps ici.
Que veux-tu dire ?
Cette convention est une honte.
Quand ce sera fini,
il ne restera pas une seule chose
que ce gouvernement
ne pourra pas faire
au nom de la sécurité nationale.
Dans combien de temps
ce sera ratifié ?
Je ne sais pas. Ils parlent
d'accélérer les débats pour coďncider
avec l'entrée du Texas
dans les États Alliés.
Cet accord avec le Texas
est si certain ?
Eh bien,
Cheyenne est assez confiant.
Ils ont fait ce qu'il fallait
pour mettre le Texas dos au mur.
Mais Jake...
Tu...
Tu ne m'as toujours pas dit
ce que vous faisiez ici.
Il faut que tu rentres, Gray.
La ville a besoin de quelqu'un
sur qui compter, qui ne se cache pas,
quelqu'un qui parle en leur nom.
Ils ont besoin de toi.
Tu écris mal "Cheyenne".
Salut, Cheung.
J'ai passé ces derniers mois ŕ pirater
les données confidentielles de <i>J&R</i>.
Sais-tu ce qui y circule
en ce moment ?
Que la bombe perdue lors des attaques
de septembre est ici ŕ Cheyenne ?
Que la bombe perdue lors des attaques
de septembre est ici ŕ Cheyenne.
- Tu veux m'expliquer ?
- Non,
pas vraiment.
Je suis ici pour la récupérer.
Il s'est passé beaucoup de choses
ces derniers mois.
J'essaierai de t'expliquer.
Commence par ça !
<i>C'est quoi la "Phase Trois" ?</i>
Ŕ compter de demain 11 h,
des quartiers entiers de la ville
seront déclarés "zones de rébellion".
Quiconque y sera aprčs le couvre-feu
sera considéré comme insurgé.
On parle de quartiers entiers,
de la rue principale...
Dčs demain, les hommes de Beck
vont commencer ŕ tirer sur les gens.
On est ŕ court d'idées.
Ça semble assez évident...
Soit nous ripostons,
soit nous abandonnons nos maisons.
Vous n'avez pas
ŕ les combattre seuls.
De quoi parles-tu ?
Ce qui vous arrive est arrivé
ŕ New Bern il y a quelques temps.
On sait ce ŕ quoi vous faites face.
Constantino sait comment les combattre.
- Qu'il aille au diable.
- Avec un ennemi aussi fort,
vous ne pouvez pas faire
les difficiles au sujet de vos alliés.
On peut s'entraider.
Eric, tu plaisantes ?
Que suis-je censé dire ?
Tu refuses.
Tu dis que ça ne t'intéresse pas
de serrer la main
d'un enfoiré
comme Phil Constantino.
Dis quelque chose.
J'en ai marre de tout ça.
Bonnie est morte
depuis quatre jours.
Et son corps est toujours
dans une boîte ŕ l'hôpital,
parce que je me cache
dans un garage !
Stanley, oů vas-tu ?
Enterrer ma soeur.
Il faut que je le fasse.
Accompagnez-le.
Aidez-le.
Ramenez-le dčs que possible.
Organise une rencontre.
Asseyez-vous !
Je ne préfčre pas.
On peut faire vite ?
Je dois quitter ma maison
pour demain 11 h.
On a déclaré ma rue
"zone de rébellion".
Pourquoi avez-vous fait ça ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Hier, on a repéré un terroriste présumé
non loin d'ici :
Robert Hawkins.
Il s'est échappé, mais on lui a repris
une arme atomique,
du męme type que celles
des attaques de septembre.
En quoi suis-je concernée ?
Il y a eu une reconnaissance aérienne
de cette ville.
On aurait dű repérer cette bombe,
mais rien n'est apparu.
On a vérifié les données d'origine,
on a trouvé une page manquante
dans un classeur de mon bureau.
Vous l'avez prise.
Vous aviez accčs ŕ ce bureau.
Je vous faisais confiance.
- J'ai pris votre défense.
- Vous avez raison.
Je l'ai prise.
Pourquoi ?
Il m'a dit que vos supérieurs
étaient du mauvais côté.
Et je le crois.
Vous réalisez que je pourrais
vous arręter, voire vous exécuter ?
Il dit que ce gouvernement
est corrompu et illégitime,
qu'il a menti sur l'origine des attaques
pour s'emparer du pouvoir.
Vous ętes naďve.
- Et vous, un lâche.
- Pardon ?
Vous savez que quelque chose cloche
dans ce pays,
et vous refusez d'ouvrir les yeux
et de le voir.
- Mes yeux sont grands ouverts.
- Non, c'est faux.
Et tous les gens de cette ville
en subissent les conséquences.
Lieutenant !
Cette femme est en état d'arrestation.
Emmenez-la.
Voilŕ ce que j'ai.
Ils ne mettront pas longtemps
ŕ inspecter la bombe,
ŕ vérifier
que c'est ce qu'ils pensent.
Pour la faire disparaître,
ils devront l'emmener hors de la ville
pour la détruire.
Ce sera plus facile d'attaquer
quand ils la transporteront.
Le problčme est lŕ.
Il n'y a rien de prévu :
aucun convoi hors de la base militaire
dans cette zone,
aucun chargement en dehors
des bâtiments sécurisés de <i>J&R</i>.
Rien de rien.
Tu sais quoi ?
Il n'y en aura pas.
La sécurité attire l'attention.
Moins de sécurité, moins remarqué.
On doit chercher un endroit banal.
En Afghanistan, on avait des itinéraires
de ravitaillement merdiques.
Ils tiraient sur tout ce qui avait
le logo <i>J&R</i>.
Alors, on a utilisé des ambulances
pour le transport.
Vérifie les hôpitaux du coin.
- Hôpital Saint Francis.
- Quoi ?
Ils viennent de signaler
une fuite de gaz,
ils ferment pour l'aprčs-midi.
Quel personnel médical
porte un 9 mm ?
Ils doivent attendre
un truc important.
Ouais.
- Allons-y.
- Pas lui.
- Quoi ?
- Désolé, Jake,
je ne te connais pas...
Je ne te fais pas confiance.
Laisse le moteur tourner.
Si ça se passe mal,
on devra déguerpir rapidement, OK ?
Jake ?
Ouais.
<i>Feu vert du colonel,
on part dčs que possible.</i>
<i>Vérifiez deux fois, assurez-vous
que c'est sans danger avant d'y aller.</i>
<i>Restez ici.</i>
- <i>Ça va ?</i>
- Ouais.
- Et toi ?
- Ouais,
je vais bien.
Bonjour, Hawkins.
Smith ?
Je... je ne pensais pas
que vous feriez vous-męme
le sale boulot.
Je n'étais pas censé le faire.
Je pensais que vous m'aideriez.
Maintenant, il me faut cette bombe.
Hawkins !
Ça va, ça va.
Je vais bien.
L'ambulance...
Je te tiens.
Monte.
C'est grave ?
J'ai connu pire.
On fait quoi maintenant ?
Continue de conduire.
Continue de conduire et...
et laisse-moi réfléchir.
Monsieur, puis-je
avoir votre signature ?
C'est quoi ?
L'inventaire des preuves retrouvées
dans la voiture d'Hawkins :
armes, fausses identités, portable.
Le transport attend dehors
pour les emmener ŕ <i>camp Liberty</i>.
Les preuves sont ici ?
Oui, Monsieur, emballées
et prętes ŕ ętre expédiées.
Je veux les voir avant.
Monsieur, elles sont cataloguées
et scellées.
Alors, je les descellerai.
Bien, Monsieur.
<i>On doit quitter les avenues</i>
sinon on nous tombera vite dessus.
On n'arrivera pas au Texas
de cette façon.
Si, on y arrivera.
On y arrivera.
D'accord.
Tu continues vers le sud...
- sur environ... dix pâtés de maisons.
- Pourquoi ?
Fais-le, Jake.
Chavez, j'ai besoin d'une faveur,
et rapidement.
Bonjour, Eric.
Étrange réunion.
J'avais imaginé qu'ŕ notre prochaine
rencontre, on garderait nos armes.
Il y a quelques semaines, je venais ŕ
New Bern t'en mettre une dans la tęte.
Qu'est-ce qui t'a arręté ?
Beck.
Intéressant.
Et tu en as toujours envie ?
Tous les jours.
Ça a le mérite d'ętre honnęte.
Russell m'a parlé de votre problčme.
Si entre toi et moi
une entraide est possible,
il y a quelque chose
que tu dois comprendre.
J'écoute.
On gagne en leur faisant perdre
la volonté de se battre.
C'est la seule maničre.
Je sais.
Quand tu détruis un convoi,
ne laisse pas de soldats vivants.
Chaque soldat tué est une perte.
Ça entraîne son remplacement
et ça sape leur volonté.
Ça ne se fera pas en un jour
ou une semaine,
ça peut prendre des années.
Je dois savoir si c'est
ce que tu comptes faire.
<i>Ouais !</i>
Hawkins, je dois savoir oů on va !
D'accord.
Par lŕ.
Ils n'ouvriront pas
les portes pour nous.
Droit devant.
Accroche-toi.
Accroche-toi.
Ne tirez pas, ne tirez pas.
Ne tirez pas.
On a besoin d'aide.
D'accord, on a besoin d'aide.
Mon ami est blessé,
s'il vous plaît.
Monsieur, c'est l'ambassade du Texas.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Mon ami s'est fait tirer dessus.
Ce n'est pas un hôpital,
c'est le territoire souverain du Texas.
S'il vous plaît.
Au sol, maintenant !
Nous demandons l'asile politique.
<i>Monsieur,
on a un problčme ŕ l'entrée.</i>
Continuez.
<i>J'ai ici des militaires de Cheyenne.</i>
<i>Ils prétendent
qu'un terroriste est entré.</i>
<i>Ils veulent qu'on leur livre.</i>
- Ne bougez pas.
<i>- Bien, Monsieur.</i>
Fermez-moi ces portes de suite,
silence radio.
Si quiconque de Cheyenne
essaie d'entrer,
ce sera pris
pour un acte de guerre.
Ambassadeur Sam Travis.
Vous avez des amis hauts placés.
Je viens de raccrocher avec San Antonio.
Le gouverneur m'a ordonné
d'accepter votre demande d'asile.
Donnez ŕ cet homme
des soins médicaux.
Je veux un médecin ici,
tout de suite.
<i>Tout de suite, Monsieur.</i>
Monsieur.
Oui, je sais.
Mettez ça ŕ l'intérieur.
Que faites-vous lŕ ?
On est venus aider.
Tu avais raison.
Ŕ quel sujet ?
Constantino.
Il a perdu quelque chose
que je ne veux pas abandonner.
Je veux dire, c'est vrai,
Cheyenne est l'ennemi, mais...
au moment oů on commence
ŕ tuer des soldats américains,
ce n'est plus pareil.
Alors, que fait-on...
quand ils commenceront
ŕ nous tirer dessus ?
Je veux croire que Beck
ne le veut pas plus que nous.
Mais s'il en arrive lŕ,
je ne lui faciliterai pas la tâche.
Donc, je serai ici...
sur cette colline,
avec mes amis...
et je ferai
ce que je sais ętre juste.
Regardez.
C'est tout ce que je peux faire ici.
On va devoir trouver un moyen
de vous emmener aux urgences.
Comment ça, "non" ?
Vous pouvez nous excuser,
s'il vous plaît ?
Je ne suis pas important.
Ce qui l'est, c'est d'emmener
cette bombe au Texas, directement.
Alors, dis-moi que tu comprends
- au milieu de quoi tu es.
- Je comprends que c'est important...
Oui, c'est important.
C'est important.
Ce qui va se passer
ces prochaines heures
va déterminer
le cours des choses pour...
les années ŕ venir,
peut-ętre męme notre histoire
pour les cent prochaines années.
Elle est lŕ notre responsabilité.
Et si ce que ça doit nous coűter
est terrible, tant pis.
C'est l'unique solution
pour un avenir meilleur
et le seul moyen
pour que le peuple reste libre.
C'est pour ça que je fais ça.
Oui, Monsieur, Stanley Richmond
et un groupe de rangers.
Je les emmčne.
- Vous devez partir d'ici.
- S'il vous plaît.
Mon fiancé enterre sa soeur.
Il a attendu quatre jours pour le faire.
- Laissez-le terminer.
- On a déjŕ appelé,
- on a ordre de l'arręter.
- Caporal Adams, vous l'avez.
On n'ira nulle part.
Laissez-le enterrer sa soeur.
Ça ne vous coűte rien.
Vous... vous avez des soeurs ?
Ou une fiancée ?
Une épouse ?
Je vous en prie.
Vous avez trente minutes.
Aprčs ça, ils viendront tous
avec nous.
Alors, faites vos adieux.
Merci.
Identifiez-vous, Monsieur...
Pardon ?
Qui ętes-vous, Monsieur ?
Je suis Gray Anderson,
le maire de cette ville.
Je ne sais pas
si on les retiendra longtemps.
On va devoir
vous faire sortir d'ici.
D'accord.
On vous emmčne
par l'autre sortie de la propriété.
La bombe vous attend
dans un véhicule diplomatique.
Ça vous permettra d'aller ŕ l'aéroport.
L'avion se trouve hangar 22.
Nous allons...
Je me méfiais
du président Tomarcchio.
Heureux que quelqu'un nous montre
qui il est réellement.
C'est le plan, alors...
La bombe est embarquée. On y va.
- Non. Je reste lŕ.
- Quoi ?
Il y a au moins une heure de vol
jusqu'au Texas.
Il ne leur faudra pas
une heure pour te localiser.
- Tu n'en sais rien.
- C'est le seul moyen, OK ?
Je dois gagner du temps,
détourner leur attention.
Tu n'as aucune chance
si tu restes ici seul.
Ça ne compte pas, c'est la mission
et rien d'autre. Je te l'ai dit.
Non, ce n'est pas tout.
Merde, Jake !
C'est pas une négociation.
Je ne négocie pas non plus.
Je ne t'écoute pas.
Attendez ici.
Désolé pour votre soeur.
Merci.
Vous ętes libres de partir.
Attendez.
C'est tout ?
Il y a environ vingt minutes,
j'ai signalé ŕ mes supérieurs
que je n'accepterais plus d'ordres
des autorités de Cheyenne.
Je pense que ce gouvernement
est profondément corrompu.
Ses actions sont criminelles,
et je ne leur reconnais plus le droit
de commander.
Et maintenant alors ?
Mes supérieurs délibčrent,
ils décident s'il faut me dénoncer
ŕ la chaîne de commandement.
Selon toute vraisemblance,
je serai inculpé
d'ici la fin de la journée.
Je passerai en cour martiale
ŕ Cheyenne pour trahison.
Mais en attendant,
je commande toujours.
Donc prenez votre temps.
Et rentrez chez vous.

<i>mais vaudrait mieux
que ce soit énorme,</i>
<i>parce que je viens de déclarer

Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je croyais t'avoir perdu.
Impossible,
jamais tu ne me perdras.
Quand ces soldats
sont venus pour toi,
tout ce ŕ quoi je pensais...
c'est : "Il ne sait pas
combien il compte pour moi."
"Il va s'en aller pour toujours
et je ne lui ai pas dit."
Eh bien, je suis lŕ maintenant.
Tu es tout pour moi.
Je veux...
Je veux descendre cette colline
et construire un foyer avec toi.
Je veux faire ma vie avec toi,

et pour le reste de ma vie.
Ça ressemble ŕ une...
Ça l'est.
Bon, et je dis quoi ?
Simplement, "je le veux".
Je le veux.
Je le veux.
J'ai dit au lieutenant de vous relâcher,
sans condition.
Rien ne vous oblige ŕ rester.
Je sais.
Et pour vous ?
Ils essaient de décider de mon sort.
Je leur ai donné le portable d'Hawkins.
Qu'ils voient les preuves de leurs yeux.
Vous aviez raison.
Pour tout.
Merci de ne pas me laisser tomber.
<i>Monsieur...</i>
Vos ordres ?
Transmettez un message ŕ vos hommes.
Dites-leur qu'un combat s'annonce.
Je croyais vous avoir demandé
de rester tranquilles en mon absence.
Contents de vous revoir.
Merci.
- Et cette convention ?
- Horrible.
Ce gouvernement,
sous lequel nous nous trouvons,
a désespérément besoin
d'ętre remplacé.
Eh bien,
ça nous obligera
ŕ garder les idées claires.
Ça ?
<i>Ouais, je me disais...</i>
<i>que ça faisait un peu trop longtemps
que Johnston Green</i>
<i>n'avait plus donné son avis
sur les choses ŕ faire.</i>
Lŕ, ça semble ętre le bon moment
de l'écouter.
On a réussi.
Et maintenant ?
Une équipe d'ingénieurs
s'occupe d'embarquer cet engin.
Quand ils l'auront inspecté,
les choses changeront trčs vite
dans ce pays.
Le vrai visage de Cheyenne
sera connu de tous.
Le Texas s'allie ŕ Columbus,
ils lancent leurs forces contre eux,
et le "gros morceau" suivra.
La prochaine
guerre civile américaine.
Ouais. Et grâce ŕ vous deux,
on dirait que les honnętes gens
vont avoir une chance de se battre.
Merci.
Ne le prends pas mal.
Mais t'es vraiment un enfoiré.
Ça va ?
Je crois qu'on a déclenché
une guerre aujourd'hui.
Laisse-moi deviner,
c'est pas ta premičre ?
Jake, cette guerre aura lieu,
avec ou sans nous.
J'espčre juste qu'on aura fait assez
pour un combat juste.
Qu'est-ce que ça fait ?
Quoi ?
D'écrire l'histoire.

<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>
<i>Bonnie's dead.</i>
<i>Goetz is off limits.</i>
No threats, no retribution,
<i>no exceptions.</i>
Stanley!
I'm declaring Jericho to be
<i>an open insurrection.</i>
<i>Western states have
all fallen in with Cheyenne.</i>
<i>Texans are getting close
to siding with Cheyenne.</i>
If that happens, it's a <i>ball game.</i>
I have one of the bombs.
<i>That bomb is the key
to bringing down this Government.</i>
- <i>They'll never let you get it to Texas.</i>
- Okay, John Smith.
<i>We found a package.</i>
<i>You're not just
some</i> innocent whistle-blower.
<i>The last time I blew the whistle,</i>
<i>I took out 23 American cities.</i>
<i>The man behind</i>
the September attacks
<i>is pretty confident that he can
use it</i> to destroy the city of Cheyenne.
When do we leave?
<i>Mary arranged for us
to meet one of</i> her runners
this side of the checkpoint
on Route 309.
He should be able to
get us through to Wyoming.
Hopefully just outside
of Cheyenne.
We're on our own from there.
The streets are going to be crawling
with soldiers from Cheyenne
and mercenaries from
Ravenwood on police patrol.
And as I am enemy number
one right now,
we're going to need
someplace safe fast.
- What about your contact there?
- Who, Cheung?
Yeah.
I got a lead on his location, but
it might take awhile to track him down.
We're going to need
something more immediate.
- Look, Jake.
- Yeah.
When we get out there,
the mission is everything.
- Yeah, I get it.
- No, no, see...
I got to be sure.
I'm asking for your help,
but I can't afford for you to go off
book out there and I don't
have any room for debate,
so if you've got any questions,
now's the time.
- Yeah, I've got a question.
- Go ahead.
How are we going to find the bomb?
No idea. Anything else?
<i>Insurgent activity
in your piece of the world</i>
<i>has reached
unacceptable levels, Major.</i>
<i>The Cheyenne government
will not tolerate this.</i>
<i>Your orders are to begin
Phase Three operations immediately.</i>
Sir,
with all due respect,
I believe it's premature
to move to phase three.
This place is still salvageable.
<i>Two prisoners escaped
your custody yesterday.</i>
<i>You've lost three supply convoys
through raiding parties the past week.</i>
<i>The time for restraint has passed.</i>
<i>You have your orders.</i>
<i>This insurrection must end.</i>
20-minute orientation,
an hour roundtable discussion,
<i>two hours for lunch?</i>
A thousand person
town hall meeting and boom,
the Second Amendment's gone.
It's a lot easier
to pacify a country
when its citizens can't shoot back.
I'm sick of people telling me
I worry too much.
This is the Constitution we're
talking about, not a stereo manual.
We'll just keep raising our voices.
I don't see
what other choice we have.
Hey, Mr. Mayor.
How are you, Gray?
Well, you mean aside from
the embolism you just gave me?
Let's take a walk, I'll explain.
Yeah, I-I'd appreciate that.
- Didn't take them long, did it?
- For what?
For J&R to build their
own private country.

<i>I can't believe things
got that bad that fast.</i>
I should've been there.
I'm wasting my time here.
What do you mean?
This convention is a Sham.
And when it's done,
I'm don't think there's anything
this government is not going
to have the power
to do in the name
of national security.
How long till they vote to ratify?
I don't know. They're talking
about speeding things up to coincide
with Texas joining
the Allied States.
They're that close to a deal
with Texas?
Well, Cheyenne's pretty confident.
And they've done a real good job
of painting the Texas into a corner.
But, Jake,
you...
you still haven't told me
what you're doing here.
You need to go home, Gray.
The town, they need somebody that
they can look to who's not in hiding.
Someone to speak for them.
But they need you back.
You spelled "Cheyenne" wrong.
Hey, Cheung.
I've spent the past few months
infiltrating J&R's secure data pipeline.
You know what's floating
around that pipeline right now?
That the last loose nuke from the
September attacks is here in Cheyenne?
The last loose nuke from the September
attacks is here in Cheyenne.
- Want to explain how it got here?
- No.
Not really.
I'm here to get it back.
Hell of a lot's happened
over the last few months.
I'll try and fill you in.
Start with that.
What's "Phase Three"?
As of 11:00 a.m. Tomorrow,
they are going to declare whole
sections of town centers of resistance.
Anyone caught inside them after the
deadline will be considered insurgents.
We're talking neighborhoods.
We're talking Main Street.
Come tomorrow, Beck's men
are going to start shooting at people.
We're running out of options.
Our options are pretty clear.
Either we start shooting back,.
or we give up our homes.
- You don't have to fight them alone.
- What are you talking about?
What's happening to you guys right now
happened to us in New Bern weeks ago.
We know what you're up against.
Constantino knows how to fight it.
Not a chance in hell.
With an enemy this big,
you really don't have the luxury
of being picky about your allies.
We can help each other.
Eric, are you kidding?
What am I supposed to say?
You say no.
You say you're not interested
in shaking hands
with an animal
like Phil Constantino.
Say something.
I'm done with this.
Stanley!
Bonnie has been dead
for four days,
and her body's still sitting in a box
in the medical center
because I'm hiding out
in some garage!
Stanley, where are you going?
To bury my sister.
I need to do this.
Go with him.
Get it done.
Bring him back here
as soon as possible.
Set up the meeting.
Sit down.
I'd rather not.
Can we make this quick?
I have to move out
of my house by 11:00 tomorrow.
Someone declared my street
a center of resistance.
Why'd you do it?
What are you talking about?
Yesterday, a terror suspect
was located not far from here:
Robert Hawkins.
He evaded capture, but we recovered
a nuclear weapon from his possession.
The same kind used
in the September attacks.
What does that have to do with me?
There was an aerial search
of this town.
Should've exposed the bomb,
but didn't.
We checked the original data,
and found a page missing
from the copy kept in my office.
You took it.
You had access to this office
I trusted you.
- I stood up for you.
- You're right.
I took it.
Why?
He told me the people
you're working for are wrong.
And I believe him.
Do you realize I could have
you imprisoned, possibly executed?
He said this government
is corrupt and illegitimate.
That it lied about who attacked
us so it could seize power.
You're naive.
- And you're a coward.
- Excuse me?
You know there's something wrong
with this country.
And you refuse
to open your eyes and see it.
- My eyes are open.
- No, they aren't.
And everyone in this town
is suffering because of it.
Lieutenant!
This woman is under arrest.
Get her out of here.
Here's what I got.
It won't take them long
to inspect the bomb,
verify it is what they think it is.
To make it disappear for good,
they're gonna have move it to disposal
facility somewhere outside of town.
It'll be easier for us to hit it
when it's on the road get the transport.
That's the problem.
There's nothing scheduled.
No convoys out of the
military base in the area.
No shipments in or out
of the secure J&R facilities.
No nothing.
You know what?
There wouldn't be.
Security draws attention.
So less security, less attention.
We need someplace off the books.
In Afghanistan, there were a few supply
routes that would get really nasty.
They would shoot at anything
with a J&R logo on it.
So we started making our runs
in ambulances.
Check the local hospitals.
- St. Francis Hospital.
- What?
They reported a gas leak
a little while ago.
They're closing
the doors for the afternoon.
How many paramedics
carry a nine millimeter?
It sure looks like
they're expecting someone.
Yeah.
- Let's go.
- Not him.
- What?
- Sorry, Jake,
I don't know you...
... I don't trust you.
Hey, hey.
You keep the engine running.
If something goes wrong, we're going
to need to get out of here fast. Right?
Jake?
Yeah.
<i>Green light from the colonel,
we're moving out ASAP.</i>
<i>Double-check that,
make sure it's secure before we go.</i>
<i>Stay right there.</i>
- <i>You okay?</i>
- Yeah.
- You?
- Yeah,
I'm okay.
Hello, Hawkins.
Smith?
Smith?
I d... I didn't think
that you did
your own dirty wo-work.
I wasn't supposed to.
I had hoped
you were going to help me.
Now, I need that bomb.
Hawkins!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Jake, Jake,
the ambulance.
I got you.
Get in.
How bad is it?
I've had worse.
What the hell
are we going to do now?
Just keep driving.
Just keep driving and...
and let me think of something.
Sir, can I get your signature here?
What is it?
Inventory of the evidence retrieved
from the terrorist Hawkins' vehicle.
Sidearm, fake IDs, laptop.
Transport's waiting outside
to take it to Camp Liberty.
The evidence is here?
Yes, sir, boxed up
and ready to ship.
I want to see it first.
Sir, it's catalogued and sealed.
Then I'll unseal it.
Yes, sir.
Hawkins.
We got to get off the street
or they're going
to be on us in no time.
We're not going
to make it to Texas like this.
Yes, we will.
Yes, we will.
Okay.
You'll keep going south...
for about...
- ten blocks.
- Why?
You just do it, Jake.
Hey, Chavez, I'm gonna need a favor,
and I'm going to need it fast.
Hello, Eric.
Strange meeting.
I'd have figured you
and I ever got this close again,
It'd be at the end of a gun.
A few weeks ago, I was on my way to
New Bern to put a bullet in your head.
What stopped you?
Beck.
Interesting.
Is that something
you still want to do?
Every day.
Something to be said for honesty.
Russell told me
about your situation.
If you and I are going
to be able to help each other,
there's something you're going
to have to understand.
I'm listening.
We win by making them
lose their desire to fight.
It's the only way.
I know.
Then, when you take out a convoy,
you got to stop leaving soldiers alive.
Every soldier
we take out costs them,
forces them to train replacements,
saps their will.
It's not going to happen
in a day or a week.
It's a process
that could take years.
I need to know if that's something
you're willing to undertake.
Hawkins.
<i>Yeah!</i>
Hawkins, I need to know
where we're going!
Okay.
<i>That way.</i>
They're not just going
to open the gate for us.
Straight in there.
<i>Hang on.</i>
Hang on.
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
We need help.
All right, we need help.
My friend's been hurt. Please.
Sir, this is a Texas embassy.
You don't understand.
My friend's been shot.
This isn't a hospital,
this is sovereign Texas soil.
Please.
On the ground now!
We are seeking political asylum.
<i>Sir, we've got a situation
at the gate.</i>
Go ahead.
<i>I've got Cheyenne military here.</i>
<i>They claim a terrorist entered the
embassy. They want us to surrender him.</i>
- Stand by.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
I want those gates closed now,
radio down.
Tell 'em if anybody from Cheyenne tries
to breach, consider it an act of war.
Ambassador Sam Travis.
You got important friends.
I just got off the phone
with San Antonio.
The governor's instructed me
to accept your request for asylum.
Get this man immediate
medical attention.
I need a medic out here ASAP.
<i>Right away, sir.</i>
Sir.
Yeah, I know.
Let's get it inside.
What are you doing here?
We came to help.
You were right.
Right about what?
Constantino.
There's something he lost
that I don't want to ever give up.
I mean, we're right
and Cheyenne is wrong, but...
the moment we start killing
American soldiers,
all that changes.
So what do we do
when they start shooting at us?
I got to believe Beck doesn't
want that any more than we do.
But if he wants to make that decision,
I'm not going to make it easy for him.
So I'm gonna be standing
on this hill in
the open with my friends...
doing something I know is right.
Hey, guys.
This is about all I can do from here.
We're going to have to find a way
and get you to an ER.
What do you mean, "no"?
Could you excuse us, please?
Jake...
... I am not important.
What is is getting that bomb
to Texas
with no detours.
Now, you tell me
that you understand what it is
- you're in the middle of right how.
- I understand it's important,
Yeah, it's important.
Like whatever happens
in the next few hours
could determine
the course of things for...
for years to come.
You know, maybe our history
for the next hundred years.
That is the responsibility
we got here.
And if that comes at a terrible cost,
then so be it.
Because that's the only way
that things get better,
and it's the only way
that people stay free.
That's why I do what I do.
Yes, sir. Stanley Richmond
and a group of Rangers.
I'll bring 'em in.
- Ma'am, you need to clear this area.
- Please.
My fiancé is burying his sister up
there. He's waited four days to do this.
- Please, let him finish.
- We've already called it in.
- We have orders to apprehend him now.
- Corporal Adams, but you have him.
We have nowhere to run.
Just let him put his sister
in the ground.
It costs you nothing.
Do-Do you have sisters?
Or a girlfriend?
A wife?
Please.
You have 30 minutes.
After that,
they're all coming with us.
So say your good-byes.
Thank you.
ID, sir?
Excuse me?
Who are you, sir?
I'm Gray Anderson.
I'm the mayor of this town.
I don't how much longer we
can keep 'em talking at the gates.
We're going to have
to get you out of here.
Okay.
We're going to take you out
back to the property next door.
Bomb's ready in a car
with diplomatic plates.
Should get you through to the airport.
The plane's in Hangar 22.
We'll...
I've had a bad feeling
about President Tomarchio.
I'm glad somebody's gonna finally
show the world what he's really about.
That's the plan, so...
Yeah.
The bomb's stored.
Let's get out of here.
- No. I'm staying.
- What?
It's at least an hour's
flight from here to Texas.
Is no way it takes them that long
to find you in the plane.
- You don't know that.
- It's the only way, okay?
I got to buy you some time,
draw their attention.
You don't stand chance
you stay here on your own.
And it doesn't matter, because
the mission is everything. I told you.
No, it isn't.
Come on.
Damn it, Jake!
I am not debating this.
I'm not debating, either.
I'm ignoring you.
- Wait here.
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
You're all free to go.
Wait a minute.
That's it?
About 20 minutes ago,
I notified my company commanders.
That I'd no longer be taking orders
from the Cheyenne leadership.
I believe this government
is corrupt at its core.
Its actions are criminal,
and I no longer recognize
their right to lead.
So what happens now?
My company commanders
are deliberating,
trying to decide whether
to report me up the chain of command.
In all likelihood, I'll be...
charged by the end of the day.
Sent to Cheyenne to face
a court-martial for treason.
But until then,
I'm still in charge,
so you take your time.
And then go home.

<i>Sierra-Tango-Nine,

what you're carrying,</i>
<i>but whatever it is better be good,</i>
<i>'cause I think I just declared war
on Cheyenne.</i>
Stanley...
What is it?
I thought I lost you.
No way. You could never lose me.
When those soldiers
were coming for you,
all I could think was,
"He doesn't know
what he means to me.
"He's going away forever,
and I haven't told him."
Well, I'm here now.
You are everything to me.
I want to...
I want to walk down this hill
and make a home with you.
I want to make a life with you.
Through anything and everything.
From this day forward,
for the rest of my life.
That sounded a lot like a...
It was.
Well, what do I say?
Just say I do.
I do.
I do.
I told the lieutenant
to release you without condition.
You don't need to be here.
I know.
What's happening in there?
They're trying to decide
what to do about me.
Gave 'em Hawkins' laptop.
Let them see the evidence
for themselves.
You were right.
About everything.
Thanks for not giving up on me.
<i>Sir...</i>
... your orders?
Pass the word to your men.
Tell them there's a fight on its way.
I thought I told you to stay
out of trouble while I was gone.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
- How was the convention?
- Terrifying.
The government
we find ourselves living under
is in dire need of replacement.
Well, that oughta make our
feelings pretty clear about it.
That?
Yeah, I just...
thought it's been a little
too long since Johnston Green's
had anything to say about
the way things are going around here.
Now seemed like a good
time for him to be heard.
Hey. We made it.
What now?
There's a team of engineers waiting
for delivery of this thing right away.
Once they inspect it,
things in this country
are goin to change pretty fast.
Cheyenne's cover-up
will be exposed.
Texas sides with Columbus,
throws its weight behind them,
and then the main event.
The next American civil war.
Yeah. And thanks
to you and Hawkins,
looks like the good guys
are going to have a fighting chance.
Thank you.
Hey, don't take this
the wrong way.
But you look like crap.
You all right?
I think we started a war today.
Let me guess not your first?
Jake, this war is coming
with or without us.
I just hope we did enough
to make it a fair fight.
Yeah.
How does it feel?
What?
Making history.

«a semble assez ťvident...
Soit nous ripostons,
soit nous abandonnons nos maisons.
Vous n'avez pas
ŗ les combattre seuls.
De quoi parles-tu ?
Ce qui vous arrive est arrivť
ŗ New Bern il y a quelques temps.
On sait ce ŗ quoi vous faites face.
Constantino sait comment les combattre.
- Qu'il aille au diable.
- Avec un ennemi aussi fort,
vous ne pouvez pas faire
les difficiles au sujet de vos alliťs.
On peut s'entraider.
Eric, tu plaisantes ?
Que suis-je censť dire ?
Tu refuses.
Tu dis que Áa ne t'intťresse pas
de serrer la main
d'un enfoirť
comme Phil Constantino.
Dis quelque chose.
J'en ai marre de tout Áa.
Bonnie est morte
depuis quatre jours.
Et son corps est toujours
dans une boÓte ŗ l'hŰpital,
parce que je me cache
dans un garage !
Stanley, oý vas-tu ?
Enterrer ma soeur.
Il faut que je le fasse.
Accompagnez-le.
Aidez-le.
Ramenez-le dŤs que possible.
Organise une rencontre.
Asseyez-vous !
Je ne prťfŤre pas.
On peut faire vite ?
Je dois quitter ma maison
pour demain 11 h.
On a dťclarť ma rue
"zone de rťbellion".
Pourquoi avez-vous fait Áa ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Hier, on a repťrť un terroriste prťsumť
non loin d'ici :
Robert Hawkins.
Il s'est ťchappť, mais on lui a repris
une arme atomique,
du mÍme type que celles
des attaques de septembre.
En quoi suis-je concernťe ?
Il y a eu une reconnaissance aťrienne
de cette ville.
On aurait dŻ repťrer cette bombe,
mais rien n'est apparu.
On a vťrifiť les donnťes d'origine,
on a trouvť une page manquante
dans un classeur de mon bureau.
Vous l'avez prise.
Vous aviez accŤs ŗ ce bureau.
Je vous faisais confiance.
- J'ai pris votre dťfense.
- Vous avez raison.
Je l'ai prise.
Pourquoi ?
Il m'a dit que vos supťrieurs
ťtaient du mauvais cŰtť.
Et je le crois.
Vous rťalisez que je pourrais
vous arrÍter, voire vous exťcuter ?
Il dit que ce gouvernement
est corrompu et illťgitime,
qu'il a menti sur l'origine des attaques
pour s'emparer du pouvoir.
Vous Ítes naÔve.
- Et vous, un l‚che.
- Pardon ?
Vous savez que quelque chose cloche
dans ce pays,
et vous refusez d'ouvrir les yeux
et de le voir.
- Mes yeux sont grands ouverts.
- Non, c'est faux.
Et tous les gens de cette ville
en subissent les consťquences.
Lieutenant !
Cette femme est en ťtat d'arrestation.
Emmenez-la.
Voilŗ ce que j'ai.
Ils ne mettront pas longtemps
ŗ inspecter la bombe,
ŗ vťrifier
que c'est ce qu'ils pensent.
Pour la faire disparaÓtre,
ils devront l'emmener hors de la ville
pour la dťtruire.
Ce sera plus facile d'attaquer
quand ils la transporteront.
Le problŤme est lŗ.
Il n'y a rien de prťvu :
aucun convoi hors de la base militaire
dans cette zone,
aucun chargement en dehors
des b‚timents sťcurisťs de <i>J&R</i>.
Rien de rien.
Tu sais quoi ?
Il n'y en aura pas.
La sťcuritť attire l'attention.
Moins de sťcuritť, moins remarquť.
On doit chercher un endroit banal.
En Afghanistan, on avait des itinťraires
de ravitaillement merdiques.
Ils tiraient sur tout ce qui avait
le logo <i>J&R</i>.
Alors, on a utilisť des ambulances
pour le transport.
Vťrifie les hŰpitaux du coin.
- HŰpital Saint Francis.
- Quoi ?
Ils viennent de signaler
une fuite de gaz,
ils ferment pour l'aprŤs-midi.
Quel personnel mťdical
porte un 9 mm ?
Ils doivent attendre
un truc important.
Ouais.
- Allons-y.
- Pas lui.
- Quoi ?
- Dťsolť, Jake,
je ne te connais pas...
Je ne te fais pas confiance.
Laisse le moteur tourner.
Si Áa se passe mal,
on devra dťguerpir rapidement, OK ?
Jake ?
Ouais.
<i>Feu vert du colonel,
on part dŤs que possible.</i>
<i>Vťrifiez deux fois, assurez-vous
que c'est sans danger avant d'y aller.</i>
<i>Restez ici.</i>
- <i>«a va ?</i>
- Ouais.
- Et toi ?
- Ouais,
je vais bien.
Bonjour, Hawkins.
Smith ?
Je... je ne pensais pas
que vous feriez vous-mÍme
le sale boulot.
Je n'ťtais pas censť le faire.
Je pensais que vous m'aideriez.
Maintenant, il me faut cette bombe.
Hawkins !
«a va, Áa va.
Je vais bien.
L'ambulance...
Je te tiens.
Monte.
C'est grave ?
J'ai connu pire.
On fait quoi maintenant ?
Continue de conduire.
Continue de conduire et...
et laisse-moi rťflťchir.
Monsieur, puis-je
avoir votre signature ?
C'est quoi ?
L'inventaire des preuves retrouvťes
dans la voiture d'Hawkins :
armes, fausses identitťs, portable.
Le transport attend dehors
pour les emmener ŗ <i>camp Liberty</i>.
Les preuves sont ici ?
Oui, Monsieur, emballťes
et prÍtes ŗ Ítre expťdiťes.
Je veux les voir avant.
Monsieur, elles sont cataloguťes
et scellťes.
Alors, je les descellerai.
Bien, Monsieur.
<i>On doit quitter les avenues</i>
sinon on nous tombera vite dessus.
On n'arrivera pas au Texas
de cette faÁon.
Si, on y arrivera.
On y arrivera.
D'accord.
Tu continues vers le sud...
- sur environ... dix p‚tťs de maisons.
- Pourquoi ?
Fais-le, Jake.
Chavez, j'ai besoin d'une faveur,
et rapidement.
Bonjour, Eric.
…trange rťunion.
J'avais imaginť qu'ŗ notre prochaine
rencontre, on garderait nos armes.
Il y a quelques semaines, je venais ŗ
New Bern t'en mettre une dans la tÍte.
Qu'est-ce qui t'a arrÍtť ?
Beck.
Intťressant.
Et tu en as toujours envie ?
Tous les jours.
«a a le mťrite d'Ítre honnÍte.
Russell m'a parlť de votre problŤme.
Si entre toi et moi
une entraide est possible,
il y a quelque chose
que tu dois comprendre.
J'ťcoute.
On gagne en leur faisant perdre
la volontť de se battre.
C'est la seule maniŤre.
Je sais.
Quand tu dťtruis un convoi,
ne laisse pas de soldats vivants.
Chaque soldat tuť est une perte.
«a entraÓne son remplacement
et Áa sape leur volontť.
«a ne se fera pas en un jour
ou une semaine,
Áa peut prendre des annťes.
Je dois savoir si c'est
ce que tu comptes faire.
<i>Ouais !</i>
Hawkins, je dois savoir oý on va !
D'accord.
Par lŗ.
Ils n'ouvriront pas
les portes pour nous.
Droit devant.
Accroche-toi.
Accroche-toi.
Ne tirez pas, ne tirez pas.
Ne tirez pas.
On a besoin d'aide.
D'accord, on a besoin d'aide.
Mon ami est blessť,
s'il vous plaÓt.
Monsieur, c'est l'ambassade du Texas.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Mon ami s'est fait tirer dessus.
Ce n'est pas un hŰpital,
c'est le territoire souverain du Texas.
S'il vous plaÓt.
Au sol, maintenant !
Nous demandons l'asile politique.
<i>Monsieur,
on a un problŤme ŗ l'entrťe.</i>
Continuez.
<i>J'ai ici des militaires de Cheyenne.</i>
<i>Ils prťtendent
qu'un terroriste est entrť.</i>
<i>Ils veulent qu'on leur livre.</i>
- Ne bougez pas.
<i>- Bien, Monsieur.</i>
Fermez-moi ces portes de suite,
silence radio.
Si quiconque de Cheyenne
essaie d'entrer,
ce sera pris
pour un acte de guerre.
Ambassadeur Sam Travis.
Vous avez des amis hauts placťs.
Je viens de raccrocher avec San Antonio.
Le gouverneur m'a ordonnť
d'accepter votre demande d'asile.
Donnez ŗ cet homme
des soins mťdicaux.
Je veux un mťdecin ici,
tout de suite.
<i>Tout de suite, Monsieur.</i>
Monsieur.
Oui, je sais.
Mettez Áa ŗ l'intťrieur.
Que faites-vous lŗ ?
On est venus aider.
Tu avais raison.
ņ quel sujet ?
Constantino.
Il a perdu quelque chose
que je ne veux pas abandonner.
Je veux dire, c'est vrai,
Cheyenne est l'ennemi, mais...
au moment oý on commence
ŗ tuer des soldats amťricains,
ce n'est plus pareil.
Alors, que fait-on...
quand ils commenceront
ŗ nous tirer dessus ?
Je veux croire que Beck
ne le veut pas plus que nous.
Mais s'il en arrive lŗ,
je ne lui faciliterai pas la t‚che.
Donc, je serai ici...
sur cette colline,
avec mes amis...
et je ferai
ce que je sais Ítre juste.
Regardez.
C'est tout ce que je peux faire ici.
On va devoir trouver un moyen
de vous emmener aux urgences.
Comment Áa, "non" ?
Vous pouvez nous excuser,
s'il vous plaÓt ?
Je ne suis pas important.
Ce qui l'est, c'est d'emmener
cette bombe au Texas, directement.
Alors, dis-moi que tu comprends
- au milieu de quoi tu es.
- Je comprends que c'est important...
Oui, c'est important.
C'est important.
Ce qui va se passer
ces prochaines heures
va dťterminer
le cours des choses pour...
les annťes ŗ venir,
peut-Ítre mÍme notre histoire
pour les cent prochaines annťes.
Elle est lŗ notre responsabilitť.
Et si ce que Áa doit nous coŻter
est terrible, tant pis.
C'est l'unique solution
pour un avenir meilleur
et le seul moyen
pour que le peuple reste libre.
C'est pour Áa que je fais Áa.
Oui, Monsieur, Stanley Richmond
et un groupe de rangers.
Je les emmŤne.
- Vous devez partir d'ici.
- S'il vous plaÓt.
Mon fiancť enterre sa soeur.
Il a attendu quatre jours pour le faire.
- Laissez-le terminer.
- On a dťjŗ appelť,
- on a ordre de l'arrÍter.
- Caporal Adams, vous l'avez.
On n'ira nulle part.
Laissez-le enterrer sa soeur.
«a ne vous coŻte rien.
Vous... vous avez des soeurs ?
Ou une fiancťe ?
Une ťpouse ?
Je vous en prie.
Vous avez trente minutes.
AprŤs Áa, ils viendront tous
avec nous.
Alors, faites vos adieux.
Merci.
Identifiez-vous, Monsieur...
Pardon ?
Qui Ítes-vous, Monsieur ?
Je suis Gray Anderson,
le maire de cette ville.
Je ne sais pas
si on les retiendra longtemps.
On va devoir
vous faire sortir d'ici.
D'accord.
On vous emmŤne
par l'autre sortie de la propriťtť.
La bombe vous attend
dans un vťhicule diplomatique.
«a vous permettra d'aller ŗ l'aťroport.
L'avion se trouve hangar 22.
Nous allons...
Je me mťfiais
du prťsident Tomarcchio.
Heureux que quelqu'un nous montre
qui il est rťellement.
C'est le plan, alors...
Merde !
- Comment fait-on avec la tour ?
- Quoi ?
Ils retrouveront vite la voiture.
- Laisse-moi descendre.
- Non, tu as peut Ítre pas remarquť,
- mais t'es pas trŤs en forme.
- Jake. ArrÍte la voiture.
Laisse-moi sortir.
Tu auras besoin de temps
pour atteindre l'espace aťrien du Texas.
Si je me dťbarrasse de la tour,
tu auras le temps nťcessaire.
Donne-moi dix minutes. Pas plus.
Et si tu ne reviens pas ŗ temps ?
Tes coordonnťes sont dedans.
Tu fais dťcoller l'avion,
et tu apportes le paquet ŗ Chavez.
Vas-y, Jake.
Vas-y, vas-y !
<i>NE ME MARCHE PAS DESSUS</i>
Hawkins ! Cours !
Cours !
Arme ŗ terre !
Attendez ici.
Dťsolť pour votre soeur.
Merci.
Vous Ítes libres de partir.
Attendez.
C'est tout ?
Il y a environ vingt minutes,
j'ai signalť ŗ mes supťrieurs
que je n'accepterais plus d'ordres
des autoritťs de Cheyenne.
Je pense que ce gouvernement
est profondťment corrompu.
Ses actions sont criminelles,
et je ne leur reconnais plus le droit
de commander.
Et maintenant alors ?
Mes supťrieurs dťlibŤrent,
ils dťcident s'il faut me dťnoncer
ŗ la chaÓne de commandement.
Selon toute vraisemblance,
je serai inculpť
d'ici la fin de la journťe.
Je passerai en cour martiale
ŗ Cheyenne pour trahison.
Mais en attendant,
je commande toujours.
Donc prenez votre temps.
Et rentrez chez vous.

Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je croyais t'avoir perdu.
Impossible,
jamais tu ne me perdras.
Quand ces soldats
sont venus pour toi,
tout ce ŗ quoi je pensais...
c'est : "Il ne sait pas
combien il compte pour moi."
"Il va s'en aller pour toujours
et je ne lui ai pas dit."
Eh bien, je suis lŗ maintenant.
Tu es tout pour moi.
Je veux...
Je veux descendre cette colline
et construire un foyer avec toi.
Je veux faire ma vie avec toi,

ŗ compter de ce jour
et pour le reste de ma vie.
«a ressemble ŗ une...
«a l'est.
Bon, et je dis quoi ?
Simplement, "je le veux".
Je le veux.
Je le veux.
J'ai dit au lieutenant de vous rel‚cher,
sans condition.
Rien ne vous oblige ŗ rester.
Je sais.
Et pour vous ?
Ils essaient de dťcider de mon sort.
Je leur ai donnť le portable d'Hawkins.
Qu'ils voient les preuves de leurs yeux.
Vous aviez raison.
Pour tout.
Merci de ne pas me laisser tomber.
<i>Monsieur...</i>
Vos ordres ?
Transmettez un message ŗ vos hommes.
Dites-leur qu'un combat s'annonce.
Je croyais vous avoir demandť
de rester tranquilles en mon absence.
Contents de vous revoir.
Merci.
- Et cette convention ?
- Horrible.
Ce gouvernement,
sous lequel nous nous trouvons,
a dťsespťrťment besoin
d'Ítre remplacť.
Eh bien,
Áa nous obligera
ŗ garder les idťes claires.
«a ?
<i>Ouais, je me disais...</i>

<i>n'avait plus donnť son avis

M. Green ?
- Oui.
- Vous avez quelque chose pour nous ?
- ņ l'intťrieur.
- Jake...
- Hť, Chavez.
- Bienvenue au Texas.
Merci.
Oý est Hawkins ?
Il n'est pas lŗ.
Il s'est rendu
pour que je finisse le boulot.
Et tu l'as fait...
tu as fini le boulot.
Une ťquipe d'ingťnieurs
s'occupe d'embarquer cet engin.
Quand ils l'auront inspectť, les choses
changeront trŤs vite dans ce pays.
Le vrai visage de Cheyenne
sera connu de tous.
Le Texas s'allie ŗ Columbus,
ils lancent leurs forces contre eux,
et le "gros morceau" suivra.
La prochaine
guerre civile amťricaine.
M. Hawkins ?
Merci, sergent.
Je m'appelle Adam Palmer.
Je suis le patron des Services Secrets
des …tats Alliťs,
et du projet Boxcar.
Vous Ítes ŗ la prison
de Loomer Ridge.
Vos blessures sont soignťes.
Quand vous serez guťri,
on vous transfťrera
dans une prison sťcurisťe.
Et vous y resterez
pour le reste de votre vie.
Quelqu'un veut vous voir.
Hť !
Vous m'avez rendu
les choses vraiment difficiles.
Mais tout s'arrÍte ici.
Vous allez me dire
tout ce que vous savez.
Ce que je sais...
Je sais que la bombe arrive au Texas
pendant qu'on parle.
Je sais que la vťritť sur vous...
sur <i>Jennings & Rall</i>,
sur le prťsident...
est une bombe qui va Ítre dťvoilťe.
Donc votre drapeau...
je sais qu'il ne flottera
plus longtemps sur le sol amťricain.
Et je sais...
qu'un jour, d'ici peu
vous et moi, on se retrouvera
dans la mÍme piŤce.
Et ce jour-lŗ...
je ne serai plus enchaÓnť !
Voilŗ ce que je sais.
Oý l'ont-ils emmenť ? Hawkins.
Une prison secrŤte.
SŻrement Loomer Ridge,
au Colorado.
C'est ce que je pensais...
- Oý vas-tu ?
- Dťlivrer mon ami.
Tu viens ?
