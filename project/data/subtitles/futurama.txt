FRY: Space: it seems to
go on and on forever.
But at the end,
a gorilla throws barrels at you.
-That's how you play the game.
-You stink, loser.
Fry! Pizza going out. Come on!
Michelle! Baby! Where you going?
It's not working out, Fry.
I put your stuff out on the sidewalk!
I hate my life. I hate my life.
Happy New Year!
Hello? Pizza delivery for. . .
. . . "I. C. Wiener. "
Oh, crud!
I always thought I'd be
the one making the crank calls.
Here's to another lousy millennium.
Ten!
[COUNTDOWN IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES]
One!
What the--?
[FRY MOANS]
My God. It's the future.
My parents,
my co-workers, my girlfriend.
I'll never see any of them again.
Yahoo!
Space Pilot 3000
[DOOR OPENS]
Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
Why do you always say it that way?
Haven't you ever
heard of showmanship?
Come, your destiny awaits!
Have a nice future.
Cool, just like in Star Trek. Ow!
LEELA: Good afternoon, sir.
FRY: Hmmmmm!
-Name?
-Fry.
I'm Leela. It's New Year's Eve. . .
. . .so I'd like to decide your fate
and leave.
-Can I ask you a question?
-If it's not about my eye.
-Is it about my eye?
-Sort of.
-Ask the question.
-What's with the eye?
I'm an alien.
Let's drop the subject.
Cool! An alien!
Has your race taken Earth?
No, I just work here.
[PROPELLER SOUNDS]
Wait a minute.
Is that blimp accurate?
Yep. It's December 31 st, 2999.
My God! A million years!
I'm sure this must be
upsetting for you.
You know, it should be,
but actually, I'm glad.
I had nothing to live for before.
I was broke. . .
. . .I had a humiliating job. . .
. . .and I think my
girlfriend was cheating on me.
Here you'll be
treated with dignity.
Strip naked and get
on the probulator.
[FRY GASPS AT SHOCK]
[PRINTER HUMS]
Interesting. Your DNA test
shows one living relative.
He's your great-great-great-
great-great-nephew.
Great!
What's the little guy's name?
Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
Ugh!
I'm the luckiest
guy in the whole future.
I've got a second chance, and this
time I won't be a total loser.
-What's that?
-Your career assignment.
Delivery boy? No! Not again!
-Anything else.
-Take your hands off me!
Everyone is given
the job they're best at.
-What if I refuse?
-You're fired.
-Fine.
-Out of a cannon into the sun.
I don't like being a delivery boy!
Tough. Most people don't like
their jobs, but we do them anyway.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
Hold out your hand.
I'll implant your career chip.
It'll label you a delivery boy.
Keep that away from me!
Hold still!
I don't have good depth perception.
You've got till five
to let me out of here. One--
See you in a thousand years.
Oh!
You owe me one.
Whoa!
[FLYING DOGS BARKING]
Radio City Mutant Hall.
Cool!
Cross-town express?
FRY:
Woo hoo!
[BUBBLE SOUNDS]
FRY:
Ha, ha, ha!
Tourist.
A phone booth. I can call my nephew.
Whoa! A real live robot. Or is
that a cheesy New Year's costume?
Bite my shiny metal ass.
-It doesn't look shiny.
-Shinier than yours, meat bag.
[FRY WHISTLES]
Listen, I'm in a hurry.
Let's try for a twofer.
VOICE IN BOOTH:
Please select mode of death.
"Quick and Painless"
or "Slow and Horrible. "
I'd like to place a collect call.
You have selected
Slow and Horrible.
Good choice!
Bring it on, baby!
Come on! Come on! Kill me already!
-My name's Bender.
-Help! What's happening?
You are dead. Thanks for
using Stop and Drop.
America 's favorite
suicide booth since 2008.
Lousy, stinking rip-off.
I didn't have any other plans.
Let's go get drunk!
--two, three-- Hey!
TERRY: Welcome to the world of
tomorrow!
Shut up, Terry.
This is unacceptable, Leela.
You must find Mr. Fry
and install his chip.
He doesn't want
to be a delivery boy.
I'd rather not force him.
That's your job,
like it or not.
It's my job to make you do
your job, like it or not.
Which I do! Very much!
Now get to work.
Life is good.
-Why would a robot need to drink?
-I don't need to.
I can quit any time I want.
[BENDER BELCHES]
So they made you a delivery boy?
That's as bad as my job.
-What do you do?
-I'm a bender.
I'm programmed to bend girders.
-You any good at it?
-You kidding? I was a star.
I could bend a girder to any angle.
30 degrees, 32.
You name it. 31 . . . .
But I couldn't go on once
I found out what they were for.
-What?
-Suicide booths.
Fry, it was a pleasure
meeting you.
-I'm gonna kill myself.
-Wait! You're my only friend.
-You really want a robot for a friend?
-Ever since I was six.
Okay, but I don't want people
thinking we're robosexuals.
So if anyone asks,
you're my debugger.
Oh, no. It's the cyclops.
-Don't look! Don't look!
-I'm not looking.
-Officer 1 B-Dl, requesting backup.
-We'll be there in five minutes.
[BENDER PANTS]
We can hide in here!
It's free on Tuesdays!
Welcome to the Head Museum.
I'm Leonard Nimoy.
Spock?!
Do the thing.
-I don't do that anymore.
-This is unbelievable!
What do you do all day?
We share our wisdom
with those who seek it.
It's a life of quiet dignity.
Feeding time!
I'm sorry, but I have to install
your chip.
Why do it if you're sorry?
It's my job.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
PRESIDENT HEADS:
Whoa!
Watch it!
That's it. You just made my list!
Down boy! Bad president!
All right, buddy.
Step away from the head.
I'm gonna get 24th-century
on his ass.
Please, officers!
There's no need to use force.
Let us handle this, weirdy.
Come on. He's just
a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.
-Keep your big nose out, Eyeball.
-No one makes fun of my nose.
LEELA:
Yee-ah!
-Damn.
-You guys were totally out of control.
That's our job. We're peace officers.
You know the law.
"You gotta do what you gotta do. "
Oh! We're trapped!
Wait! You're a bender, right?
We can get out if you bend the bars.
Dream on, skin-tube! I'm programmed
to bend for constructive purposes.
-Do I look like a de-bender?
-Who cares about your program?
If programmed, would you
jump off a bridge?
I'll have to check my program.
Yep!
LEELA: Open up!
-Come on, Bender.
Make your own decisions.
It separates people and robots
from animals. . .
-. . .and animal-robots.
-You're full of crap, Fry!
[ELECTRICITY BUZZING]
You make a persuasive argument, Fry.
[BENDER GRUNTS]
[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
Come on, Bender! You can do it!
Can't. I can't do it!
Yes!
You were right. From now on,
I'm going to bend what I want. . .
. . .when I want, who I want.
I'm unstoppable!
I don't know how you did that.
-Wait!
-No thanks!
Looks like one of us
will have to bend this grate. Aw!
Good Lord! What is this?
It's the decaying ruins
of old New York.
Welcome home, pal.
It's my old neighborhood.
Man, this brings back memories.
Keep them to yourself.
This is where I brought
my girlfriend on our first date.
My God! She's gone. Everyone I
ever knew or cared about is gone.
There's someone you know.
Can't you leave me alone?
I'm miserable enough already.
I know it's not much consolation,
but I understand how you feel.
-You don't. I've no home, no family.
-No friends.
My whole world is gone.
You can't understand what
it feels like to be so alone.
I understand. I'm the only
one-eyed alien on this whole planet.
My parents abandoned me. I don't
even know what galaxy they were from.
I know how it feels to be alone.
Leela, I don't understand this world,
but you obviously do.
So I give up.
If you really think I should be
a delivery boy, I'll do it.
Your chip!
-What are you doing?
-Quitting.
-Why?
-Because I've always wanted to.
I never realized it until
I met you.
What is the matter with you?
-I wanted to be part of the moment.
-He stole my ring!
Sorry.
Well, that solves the mystery
of the missing ring.
This calls for a drink.
I don't want to spoil it,
but we're all job-deserters now.
-Unemployed and nowhere to go.
-Correction: Unemployed. . .
. . .but we have an old relative
to mooch off of.
[SNORES]
Hi, I'm Dick Clark's head.
Welcome to a special year 3000
edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve!
[DOORBELL RINGS]
-Who are you?
-I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
-I don't have an Uncle Fry.
-You do now!
By God, I am your nephew!
This is absolutely incredible!
-Can we have some money?
-Oh, my, no.
Let me show you around.
That's my lab table
and this is my work stool.
That's my intergalactic spaceship.
And here's where I keep
assorted lengths of wire.
-A real live spaceship!
-I designed it myself.
Let me show you the different
lengths of wire I used.
[KNOCK AT THE DOOR]
POLICE: Attention, job-deserters!
Exit with your hands up!
-We have you partially surrounded!
-No!
Get those bums.
-We're boned.
-Can't we get away in the ship?
I suppose it is technically possible.
Though I am already in my pajamas.
I'll get us out.
-Can anyone drive stick?
-I can.
As long as I don't have to
parallel park.
If they try to take off,
give them an assful of laser.
Prepare for liftoff!
-Ten.
-Nine!
Seven!
Five!
Four.
-Three.
-Two.
-One!
-Blastoff!
Fire! Fire!
Can't see nothing. Pretty, though.
I guess without jobs
we'll be fugitives forever.
Not necessarily.
Are you, by any chance, interested
in becoming my new spaceship crew?
New crew?
What happened to the old crew?
Those poor sons of--
That's not important.
What's important is
I need a crew.
-Anyone interested?
-Yes! Yes!
It's what I've always wanted!
Thanks for the offer, but we don't
have the proper career chips.
That's not a problem.
As luck would have it, I saved
the chips from my previous crew.
Awesome!
Are we gonna fight space monsters
and teach alien women to love?
If by that you mean
transporting cargo, yes.
It's a business I started
to fund my research.
Cool! What's my job gonna be?
You'd be responsible for ensuring that
the cargo reaches its destination.
-So I'll be a delivery boy?
-Exactly!
All right!
I'm a delivery boy!
As new employees, give
your opinion on our commercial.
I've paid to air it during Super Bowl.
-Wow.
-Not on the same channel, of course.
ANNOUNCER:
lnterplanetary delivery's a headache.
Evans, where's the package
from Earth?
Uh. . . .
I'm not Evans!
He should have used Planet Express!
ANNOUNCER: When companies aren 't
brave or foolhardy...
ANNOUNCER: ... trust Planet Express
for reliable delivery.
Your package,
Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob.
Good work, Evans.
You've got a future around here.
Thank you, sir.
ANNOUNCER: Our crew's replaceable.
Your package isn 't.
-Are there really giant birds?
-No, that was all special effects.
Now let's have breakfast.
I hope everyone likes eggs.

Episode Two: The Series Has Landed
I can't get used to
the 31 st century.
Caffeinated bacon. Baconated
grapefruit. Admiral Crunch?
If you don't like that,
try Archduke Chocula.
Ah, Hermes!
Crew, meet Hermes Conrad.
He manages my delivery business,
pays the bills. . .
. . .notifies next of kin,
what have you.
Someone dropped off this package.
Which of you is the captain?
Oh, my. I haven't picked
a new captain yet.
It's always so hard to choose.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
[BENDER BURPS]
-You!
-Oh!
This is just a standard
legal release. . .
. . .protecting Planet Express from
lawsuits in event of the unforseen.
"Death by airlock failure. "
"Death by brain parasite. "
-"By sonic diarrhea. "
-You don't want that.
I don't know about
previous captains. . .
. . .but I intend to do
as little dying as possible.
Sign the paper.
Now, Fry, before you go into space,
you'll need to see our staff doctor.
I should warn you, though.
He's a little unusual.
He wears sandals.
Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new
delivery boy. He needs a physical.
Excellent. Excellent.
[MAKES SLURPING NOISE]
You'll be fine.
Open your mouth and let's
look at that brain.
No, no, not that mouth.
I only have one.
Really?
-Is there a human doctor around?
-Young lady, I'm an expert on humans.
Pick a mouth, open it and say--
[BUZZES]
Uh. . . .
[BUZZES]
What?! My mother was a saint!
Get out!
[BENDER GROANS]
Lord, Bender, you're filthy.
Like you don't have crap in your neck.
Amy, give his body a going-over
with the cleaning pick.
Okay. Does it hurt
when I go like this?
Ow!
A little.
The doctor says I'm healthy.
Can I go into space now?
As soon as we finish cleaning Bender.
This is our intern, Amy Wong.
She's an engineering student of mine.
I like having her around.
She's the same blood type as me.
Hey, you're the unfrozen guy from
the 20th century, right?
Last time I checked.
Hang on. Amy Wong?
Of the Mars Wongs?
Look, we're not as rich
as everybody says.
-What's your sorority?
-Kappa Kappa Wong.
Hey, rich girl, look over here!
It's me, Bender.
I'm being entertaining.
La-la-la, look at my head!
It's all painted, look at my head!
I got a big old head, and hey, ho!
Show's over, I'm tired.
Ah, to be young again
and also a robot.
I recall you youngsters
have a package to deliver.
Finally! Come on, Bender.
Let's mosey.
Nice catch, idiot.
-Where are we going?
-Nowhere special. The moon.
The moon? The moon moon?
Wow! I'll be a famous hero.
Like Neil Armstrong and other
guys no one's heard of!
I love stuff like the moon.
Can I come?
Well, I guess so. Be careful. I'd
like to hold off any major screwups. . .
. . .until at least my second day.
Nothing will go wrong. If something
goes wrong, bring back the blood.
-Can I do the countdown?
-Sure. Knock yourself out.
-1 0, 9--
-Okay, we're here.
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 , blastoff.
-Hurry! I want to see the moon!
-Relax, it's open till 9.
That's one small step for Fry--
And one giant line for admission.
Can I have cuts?
No.
You won't believe it. There's
an amusement park on the moon!
It's the happiest place
orbiting Earth.
-Let's go already.
-We have a crate to deliver.
Let's dump it
and say we delivered it.
Too much work. Let's burn it
and say we dumped it.
-If everyone's finished being stupid--
-I had more, but you go ahead.
We'll deliver that crate
like professionals.
I've never been to the moon.
All right, we'll deliver that
crate like professionals. . .
. . .then we'll ride the bumper cars.
Amy, help Fry hoist the crate, then
lock up when you're done. Be careful.
Aye, aye, captain. I mean, Only One
Eye. I mean, yes, sir. Ma'am.
-Clear?
-Clear.
-Ready to hoist?
-Ready.
Ow!
My first space delivery.
Greetings, Moon Man.
We come in peace.
I am Fry, from the planet Earth.
Wise guy. If I wasn't so lazy,
I'd punch you in the stomach.
-But you are lazy, right?
-Oh, don't get me started.
[BAND PLAYS]
Hi! I'm Crater Face!
Welcome to Luna Park!
I'll have to confiscate
your alcohol.
Better mascots than you have tried.
I still have my self-respect.
[LAUGHS]
[CRIES]
Who buys this trash?
Idiots who need gifts
for other idiots.
I got you guys refrigerator magnets!
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it-- Uh-oh!
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you....
[BARKS]
[PANTS]
Keep those things off of me.
Magnets screw up my inhibition unit.
So you flip out and act like
a crazy folk singer?
Yes. I guess a robot would have to
be crazy to want to be a folk singer.
We're whalers on the moon
We carry a harpoon
There ain 't no whales so we tell
tall tales and sing a whaling tune
Bender! Bender! Over here!
Oh, jeez. I went to high school
with that guy.
ANNOUNCER: Monsanto presents
"The Goophy Gopher Revue!"
Why does moon rock taste better
than Earth rock?
Because it's a little meatier.
This is weak.
Address all complaints
to the Monsanto Corporation.
What's wrong?
I don't know. This place is great,
but it's so artificial.
The gravity, the air, the gophers.
You might as well stay on Earth.
That's what I came to see!
I want to jump like an astronaut.
Screw this phony stuff.
But the phony stuff is fun.
It's boring out there.
You're the kind of guy
who visits Jerusalem. . .
. . .and doesn't see the Sexeteria.
Maybe I'll take Fry
on the lunar rover ride.
You wear a spacesuit
and drive around.
It's educational, so no line.
I don't care how educational it is.
Let's do it!
Next year in Jerusalem!
Finally. Get ready for
some serious moon action.
ANNOUNCER: The story of lunar
exploration started with one man:
ANNOUNCER:
A man with a dream.
One of these days, Alice!
Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!
Wow! I never realized
the first astronauts were so fat.
That's no astronaut.
It's a TV comedian.
He used space travel as
a metaphor for beating his wife.
Wow! I could swear I was really
playing Virtual Skeeball!
Look, it's that crate we were
gonna throw in the sewer.
The keys to the ship!
They must have fallen into the crate.
-Leela's gonna kill me.
-No, she'll probably make me do it.
Could you get those keys out for me?
What do I look like,
a guy who's not lazy?
[CURSES IN CHINESE]
ANNOUNCER: No one knows where, when
or how man first landed on the moon.
-I do.
-But our fun-gineers think...
...it might've happened
something like this:
We're whalers on the moon
We carry a harpoon
There ain 't no whales so we tell
tall tales and sing a whaling tune
That's not how it happened.
I don't see you with
a fun-gineering degree.
This is stupid. I'll take
this out to the real moon.
This is my first mission,
and I won't let us get in any trouble.
-Besides, the car's on a track.
-Not for long.
I died doing what I loved.
Okay, you're on the surface.
I'll give you 1 0 minutes.
You'll get bored, turn around
and apologize for being a jerk.
-Agreed.
-Agreed.
Yee-haw! Whoo!
Yeah! Crank up the radio!
We're whalers on the--
Time's up. Make a U-turn
at the next crater.
How about we look for
the original moon landing site?
That's crazy.
-It's been lost for centuries.
-Well, I'm feeling lucky.
Ooh! Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!
Uh. . . .
I'm ready to go back now.
We're gonna die!
It's every man for himself!
Help me, Leela!
You did it. We're safe.
No. Now we're gonna die.
It's every man for himself!
[SIGHS]
-I won this from a tourist's pocket.
-Shut up! You're distracting me!
Come on, it's just like making love.
You know, left, down, rotate 62
degrees, engage rotor.
I know how to make love.
Oh!
Here, let me do it.
Uh. . . . Ee. . . .
Lousy arm. Must be rigged.
That's her, officers! That's the
woman who programmed me for evil!
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build
my own theme park. . .
. . .with blackjack and hookers.
In fact, forget the park.
[FRY PANTS]
I'm sorry, Leela.
I can't go on any further.
Just leave me in that barn over there.
[PANTING]
[SIGHING]
Thank God!
-Trespassers, eh?
-No, we're amusement park patrons.
That's a wicked, sinful place.
Tilt-A-Whirl's okay,
but the rest is mighty wicked.
We're out of oxygen.
Can we borrow some?
Borrow? Looky here, city girl.
Oxygen don't grow on trees.
You'll earn it doing chores
on my hydroponic farm.
You can go back to your
theme park at sunup.
We could do chores for a few hours.
Night lasts two weeks on the moon.
Yep. Drops down to minus 1 73.
Fahrenheit or Celsius?
First one, then the other.
Them spacesuits ain't heated.
You're going nowhere till sunrise.
Sleep in the barn.
Just don't be a-touching my three
beautiful robot daughters, you hear?
Robot daughters?
-This here is Lulabelle Seven.
-Yoo-hoo!
-Daisy Mae 1 28K.
-Yoo-hoo!
And the Crush-A-Nator!
Yoo-hoo.
Whoo.
LEELA: I said to turn around
and go back to the park.
But the park was too phony.
We had to see the real moon.
It was great!
We saw craters and rocks.
That incredible rock that looked
like a crater, and these fellas.
Face it. The moon's a dump.
A boring, dried-up wasteland.
The only reason people come
is for the tacky amusement park.
-Can't you accept that?
-I guess I can't.
[GUNSHOT]
I'll learn you
to sleep with my robot daughters!
-He'll never find me in here!
-Bender?
You didn't touch
the Crush-A-Nator, did you?
Of course not. A lady that fine,
you gotta romance first.
[SCREAMS]
No, you don't!
Come here, Crush-A-Nator!
Yes, Pa.
-It's too low!
-Hang on. Hang on. Jump!
Hold on to your helmet!
[CHEERING]
-Yes!
-Oh, boy!
Goldarn it, Crush-A-Nator! Jump!
No, Pa. I love him.
Oh!
Hey, cool!
Dark side of the moon.
Nightfall's coming.
-Hurry, before we freeze!
-What do you mean "we," mammal?
Oh, dear. I really ought
to do something.
But I am already in my pajamas.
We can't outrun it forever.
Over there! Look!
It's the moon landing site!
We found it!
Quick, get in.
It's that flag from MTV!
And Neil Armstrong's footprint!
My foot's bigger. Isn't this
the greatest thing you've ever seen?
Look around. A crummy plastic flag
and a dead man's tracks in the dust.
LEELA:
Now get in here before you freeze.
Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine.
I'll build my own lunar lander,
with blackjack and hookers.
In fact, forget the lunar lander
and the blackjack.
Screw the whole thing.
If the oxygen holds out, we might
live long enough to starve to death.
I'm sorry. I never should have
dragged you out here.
You shouldn't have. I still don't
get what the big attraction is.
[SIGHS]
I never told anybody this. . .
. . .but I'd look at the moon
and dream of being an astronaut.
I didn't have the grades,
nor physical endurance.
Plus, nobody liked
spending a week with me.
A week would be a little much.
The moon was this awesome, mysterious
thing hanging in the sky. . .
. . .where you'd never reach it,
no matter how much you wanted to.
You're right. Once you're actually
here, it's just a big, dull rock.
I wanted you to see it through
my eyes, the way I used to.
Fry, look.
It really is beautiful. I don't
know why I never noticed before.
[PANTS]
You had to come back
for the Crush-A-Nator.
Well, I got you this time.
It's Amy! We're saved!
Where did she learn to operate
the controls like that?
Not the magnet!
No! No! No!
Uh-oh.
[CHEERS]
She'll be coming around the mountain
when she comes
I'll kill you, Amy!
She'll be coming around the mountain
She'll be coming around the mountain
Dang it!
[GASPS]
She'll be riding six white horses
When she comes
She'll be riding six white horses
When she comes
I'm pretty good.
She'll be riding....
So, was the real moon anything like
the moon you used to dream about?
Well, close enough.
One more time!
I, Roommate
[SNORES]
[ALARM RINGS]
Hey!
If you're going to live in the
office, at least be on time for work.
I'm sorry. I was up really late
poking through people's desks.
All right, I will now outline
today's 1 2-point agenda.
We'll begin with point one,
then race forward--
Concerning our pest problem. . .
. . .somebody's leaving food
around, attracting owls.
And l, for one, am getting tired
of cleaning those owl traps.
Now. . .
. . .as this shocking graph shows, our
water consumption tripled last month.
I noticed Fry's been here a month. . .
. . .so I'll appoint him to
find who's responsible.
Fry?
[HUMS]
Am I cracking up, or is Fry's living
here getting in the way of bus--?
You're getting a huge
dose of radiation.
And great lift.
Know how long it'll take
to recalibrate these?
When you look this good,
you don't have to know anything.
We need to talk about Fry.
That's right! We want money!
What's this about Fry?
He's nice, but it's time
he got his own place.
Fuff! He's not causing trouble. Now
if you don't mind, I'm rather busy.
I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy.
This sarcophagus should
contain Emperor Nimballa. . .
. . .who ruled Zubin Five over
29 million years ago.
Hey, professor, great jerky.
My God, this is an outrage!
I was going to eat that mummy!
Fry has got to go!
NARRATOR:
Bachelor Chow, now with flavor.
ANNOUNCER:
And Bigfoot is down!
Sheesh, 40,000 channels and only
1 50 of them have anything good on.
ANNOUNCER: All My Circuits
brought to you by...
...Robo Fresh, designed
by a robot, for a robot.
I've been processing this for some
time, Monique. Will you marry me?
Oh, Calculon!
It fits!
-You must know I'm--
-Metric?
I've always known, but for you,
my darling, I'm willing to convert.
Must be a friend of theirs.
We've got to discuss
your living arrangements.
-We've all talked it over--
-All My Circuits !
Move over.
Sometimes in close quarters, people do
inconsiderate things not realizing it.
-I know, but I forgive you.
-No. . .
. . .by "close quarters,"
I mean this office.
-By "people," I mean you.
-Right.
-And by "inconsiderate"--
-We're trying to watch TV!
Yeah, would you kindly
shut your noise hole?
-Who's the weird-looking guy?
-He's a human.
-What's he do?
-Usually human stuff.
-He laughs, he learns, he loves.
-Boring.
Calculon, I thought
you were in a coma.
I wanted you to think that
with your soft, human brain.
FRY:
Hey, why's the TV getting smaller?
We'll bill you for the couch.
Cheer up, meat bag.
You barely touched your amoeba.
I just don't feel like eating.
You want it?
Nah, I'm watching my input. I need
lots of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.
The chemical energy keeps
my fuel cells charged.
-What are the cigars for?
-They make me look cool.
I can't believe they threw
me out. I must have been a jerk.
Yeah, but everybody's a jerk.
You, me, this jerk.
That's my philosophy.
So where are you gonna stay?
I don't know.
Do refrigerators still come in boxes?
But the rent's outrageous.
Why don't you move in with me?
Really? That would be great!
You sure I won't be imposing?
Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
-Here we are, your new home!
-Cool.
I've never seen a robot's apartment.
Come on in. I'll give you the tour.
Let's see. Where to start?
Okay, this is the TV area.
That's the breakfast nook.
Here's where you'll live. . .
. . .which is great because
it's been wasted space.
It's cramped. I don't even
have room to hang my clothes.
You've got one set of clothes. . .
. . .and you're not taking
them off while I'm here.
-Well, I'm bushed. Good night.
-Wait, Bender. Bender?
[BENDER SNORES]
Kill all humans, kill all humans.
Must kill all hu--
Bender, wake up!
I was having the most wonderful dream.
I think you were in it.
Listen, Bender,
where's your bathroom?
-Bath what?
-Bathroom.
-What room?
-Bathroom!
-What, what?
-Never mind.
Hey, sexy mama.
Want to kill all humans?
[WHISTLES]
We're cheerful this morning.
This week with Fry's been a blast.
Beneath the warm, sunny exterior beats
the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
-What happened?
-It's Bender's apartment.
He put in carpeting.
Now, my head hits the ceiling.
Do you realize you're
standing at a weird angle?
-Now you're okay.
-Look at you.
You're a wreck.
You have to find a new place.
Is that an invitation?
Love your optimism. Seriously, you
must tell Bender you're moving out.
He might get upset.
I can't do that to him.
Hey, there's my little space heater.
[LAUGHING]
-Well, I'm moving out.
-What?
I'm sorry, but there's
not enough room.
Not enough room? My place is two
cubic meters and we only take up 1 .5.
We have room for another
two-thirds of a person!
What if I help you two
find a bigger place?
I don't know. I've got a lot of
great memories in my old place.
And now they're gone.
Sure, it ain't one of them
la-di-da aboveground places. . .
. . .but if you like dank,
hey, forget about it!
At least it's got a great view.
What the--?
Excuse me. I gotta go
change a light bulb.
Wow! Now, this is fantastic!
I'm not sure we want to pay for
a dimension we won't use.
I give up. What's the catch?
No catch, although we are
technically in New Jersey.
Not one place even remotely livable.
Oh, how awful. Did he
at least die painlessly?
To shreds, you say?
Well, how is his wife holding up?
To shreds, you say?
Very well, then.
Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news
about my colleague, Dr. Mobootu.
Was his apartment rent-controlled?
Wow! This is beautiful!
BENDER: What's with the crap?
-It's not crap.
Dr. Mobootu collected this crap
while he explored the universe.
This place has everything but
the thing I care about, a TV.
It's got a TV, you young
what-you-call-it. Idiot.
Slow down! This place
just doesn't feel like home.
It just isn't cozy.
I can barely move.
It's perfect!
Man, it's a total sty!
For the first time in years,
I feel like I'm home.
It's gonna be fun on the bun.
You know, Fry, of all the friends
I've had, you're the first.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
-Hey, mon.
-Blub-blub.
Happy housewarming, Fry.
It's a miniature fruit-salad tree.
-Hey, Amy.
-Hey.
This is for you, Fry. Zevulon
the Great. He's teriyaki-style.
Wow, heavy-drinking crowd.
I'd better get more beer.
All My Circuits is starting.
But I need alcohol
to power up my batteries.
If Calculon's wedding
doesn't go just right. . .
. . .I'll be emotionally
and electrically drained.
Ey.
These are mighty tasty.
Thank you. I made them myself.
The wedding's about to start.
If anyone here objects to this union,
let them speak now or forever hold--
[BEEPING]
-Is he objecting or backing up?
-Both.
My half brother is correct.
I have a terrible secret.
And that secret is--
-Oh, come on!
-Fix it!
What happened to the TV?
-It went out.
-This is an outrage!
I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
All right!
Come back, Bender!
It's working.
To reiterate, my terrible secret is--
-It's out again.
-What? That's the last straw.
It's back on!
I don't mean to pry
into what you're doing. . .
. . .with the one-eyed
lady and Chinese girl. . .
. . .but everyone's having
trouble with their reception.
Get rid of what's causing it
or we're out of this dump!
Relax, sonny. This cajigger will
find the source of the interference.
[BEEPS MODERATELY]
[BEEPS QUICKLY]
[BEEPS SLOWLY]
[BEEPS MODERATELY]
-Hey, come on!
-We want our TV back!
[BEEPS QUICKLY]
There's the problem.
My God, Bender, it's your thingy!
Then get rid of it!
You people are nuts! My antenna
never interfered with my old TV.
You had cable.
This is satellite.
Your thoughts are transmitted
on the same frequency.
-They're on my cell phone too.
-Madam, I believe you're mistaken.
BENDER:
Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!
Those could be anyone's
thoughts, fat ass.
-The robot has to go!
-Yeah!
-Well, you heard the mob.
-Fine!
Let's move to that
apartment that smelled.
You liked that one.
It's tempting, but I am
already kind of settled in here.
We can live underground with mutants.
Some fire'll show them who's boss.
Is there maybe some way we could do
this with you going and me not going?
I don't understand.
You live in the closet.
You'll be as happy in your old place.
But we wouldn't be roommates.
I'll come visit.
And you can visit me here.
-No, he can't!
-Anyway, it'll work out.
This way, we'll both be happy.
Happy. Yeah, that's Bender.
Always happy.
Hey! The TV's back on!
VOICE ON TV: We are gathered to mourn
Calculon 's death...
...industrialist, private eye, friend.
CALCULON:
Mind if I give the eulogy?
WOMAN'S VOICE:
Calculon, you're alive!
[CHEERING]
BLOND-HAIRED NEIGHBOR:
Calculon's back!
FARNSWORTH:
Right. So long.
Goodbye.
Will Calculon's evil
twin ever walk again?
I don't know, Amy.
I just don't know.
Hey, thanks for coming.
How could you let that mob
kick Bender out?
Come on. Bender loves mobs.
When he's in them.
You really hurt his feelings.
Don't girl me with that
girl stuff. We're guys.
Guys don't have feelings.
-Bender's not a guy; he's a robot.
-Same thing.
It's so big and empty.
My roommate's gone.
All he left behind was an
eyelash and three skin flakes.
What's the point?
Bender? My God, you're a mess!
-Leave me alone.
-Look at that five o'clock rust.
You've been up not drinking.
Hey, what I don't do is
none of your business!
Please have a malt liquor, if not
for you, for those who love you.
I hate the people who love me,
and they hate me.
It's obvious you miss
being Fry's roommate.
There's a better way
to deal with it.
Like how?
Having my antenna removed?
Well, if that would work.
You crazy? That's Little
Bender you're talking about!
I can't cut it! You're not a robot
or a man, so you wouldn't understand.
I gotta get out of here.
Wait, look at me and promise
you won't get behind the wheel. . .
. . .without an alcoholic
beverage in your hand.
I promise nothing!
[MUMBLES]
Oh!
What up?
I can't be silent
about Bender anymore.
Silent? You've been
meddling for two weeks.
I can't just do that. Your best
friend's out there destroying himself.
I didn't think he'd miss
this apartment that much.
He doesn't. He cares about you.
And you turned your back on him.
Oh, man, I had no idea. If only I
knew where he was, I'd go talk to him.
Oh, stupid TV!
You're blind, stinking sober!
Right! I'm sober and crazy and
I don't know what I might do!
-Don't do it!
-I don't know what it is!
Oh, yeah, now I remember.
I thought I could live
alone, but I can't.
So, I'm gonna do what it takes
to be your roommate again.
-Stop!
-Cutting her head off won't help!
No, I'm gonna chop off my antenna.
Hey, yeah, that sounds good.
Can I give you a hand?
Don't help him mutilate himself!
It's a useless antenna.
He's not a ham radio.
I'm gonna do it, I'm really gonna
do it! Don't try and stop me!
Here goes!
Oh.
Hey, it worked! The static's gone!
-I hate that this came between us.
-Me too.
I'm filled with a large
number ofpowerful emotions.
You're my best friend.
Sorry I treated you badly.
Apology accepted.
After all, you're only human.
You guys could learn from them.
-She's right.
-You're my best friend, Fry.
-I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
-Apology accepted.
After all, you're only human.
Wait a minute.
You did it all backwards.
Fry's the one who should be--
Oh, never mind.
Oh.
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.
I'm just gonna have to get
used to being half a robot.
This isn't right. If we found
your antenna, could they reattach it?
Maybe, if we get it on ice right away.
Bingo!
You call that an antenna?
This time, you'll have
the human comforts.
We'll get a couple of toilets,
food cookers, maybe a puppy.
-It's good to be home.
-It sure is.
I saved your stuff.
So that's where
those skin flakes went.
-Will this tree get enough light?
-The closet has a window.
This is huge! Bender, why
don't I just live in here?
In a closet? Oh, humans.
What a great choice. Amazing food!
And such generous portions.
Just wait till you try the mints.
Doug, most guys are put off by my eye.
It's nice to meet someone open-minded.
Ew!
Love's Labour Lost in Space
What went wrong last night?
I don't know.
I couldn't put my finger on it.
Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
You're too picky.
If you rule out every guy
with a lizard tongue or low l.Q. . .
. . .or a temper,
you're gonna be lonely.
There's nothing wrong
with having high standards.
Leela's problem is purely medical.
She'll drop her eggs.
They'll hatch and all will be well.
Give guys a chance.
You think a guy is a pig, but then
you realize he has a good body.
Thank you for the inspiring advice.
But I'm happy with my life.
That sounds like a cry for help.
Let's go out.
There's great places to meet people.
-The Sex Bureau.
-A saucy puppet show.
A rotting whale carcass.
I'll pick.
Oh, wow! It's totally retro!
-Why's everyone wearing rings?
-Because nobody wears them anymore.
-Rings are stupid.
-They look cool.
Don't let anyone hear you!
Did he say rings are cool?
-No, he said they're stupid.
-Cool!
What do you think of that guy?
-I don't know. Maybe.
-Forget it. He's gay.
What? How can you tell?
I just know these things.
I've got "gaydar. "
There's no such thing.
No?
Okay, I got a lock on him.
Yep! He's gay.
-Are you sure?
-Definitely!
Or it's interference
from a gay weather balloon.
You're from the 20th century?
That's incredible. I'm from the 21 st!
We've got so much in common!
We sure do. Remember when
the cyborgs enslaved humanity?
Yeah! That rings a bell.
This is Bolt Rolands.
He's a hyper-sled racer
with 1 0 wins on the pro circuit.
Hello, beautiful.
I think she means 1 0 wins
on the gay circuit.
I wish. Those cats can really fly.
M'oh.
This is M-5438,
an entity of pure energy.
Great. But he's just
not what I'm looking for.
I understand. One day you will
evolve beyond your physical body.
And on that day, I hope
you will pick up the phone.
You're impossible.
Just as well.
He comes from a dimension. . .
. . .that's big on musical theater.
I need the apartment.
Go see a saucy puppet show.
Can do!
My, my, my.
What's a beautiful lady like you--?
Oh, my! I'm sorry!
I thought you had two eyes.
Leela, you must've had your pick
last night at closing time.
Could you stop talking
about my personal life?
Yes, let's talk about
Leela's personal life later.
We have business to attend to.
-A delivery?
-A tax-deductible mission of charity.
ROBOTIC VOICE:
This is Vergon 6.
This is Vergon 6.
Buh!
It's a sunny little doomed planet
inhabited by frisky, doomed animals.
-Animals?
-That's right.
Animals in need of rescue.
Vergon 6 was once filled with
the dense substance "Dark Matter. "
Each pound of it weighs over
1 0,000 pounds.
Wait. What about the animals?
Well, Dark Matter is valuable
as starship fuel.
That's why it was mined out,
leaving the planet hollow.
But what about the animals?
-The--?
-The animals.
I didn't mention animals. The planet
will collapse within three days.
This will kill all the animals.
We have to save two of each kind.
Like Noah's Ark.
Why two?
Oh.
[GIGGLES]
I bet Leela's holding out
for a one-eyed guy.
That'll take forever.
She ought to find a guy
with two eyes and poke one out.
That'd be a timesaver.
Do you mind?
You can use this as a poker.
Thanks, if it's less than five,
I don't care how many eyes he has.
I want a guy who's adventurous, self-
confident, maybe a snappy dresser.
These new uniforms are snappy,
first officer.
I suppose, captain.
I'm not a big fan
of velour as you are.
What do you want
to do about that ship?
Destroy them!
That's got a nice feel to it.
ZAPP:
Captain's journal. Stardate, 3000.3.
KIF:
Who are you talking to?
You. Aren't you getting this?
A vessel is attempting to break
the security cordon around Vergon 6.
I'm anticipating a tactical dogfight,
followed by a light dinner.
Ravioli, ham, sundae bar. . . .
Hey, look! Zapp Brannigan's ship.
-Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
-Uh-huh.
Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
Shall I fire on them now, sir?
Not yet, Kif.
In the game of chess, never let
your adversary see your pieces.
What?
Zapp Brannigan alone
saved the Octillion System. . .
. . .from rampaging Killbots.
-Wow!
-A grim day for robot-kind.
But we can build more Killbots!
He's the most decorated captain
in the Order of Planets.
Leela's got a boyfriend!
No, but we ought to see
if he'll help us rescue those animals.
In case you hit it off,
you'll want to take this with you.
They're headed for us.
A calculated move out of Sun Tzu's
classic text, The Art of War.
Or my own masterwork,
Zapp Brannigan 's Big Book of War.
The one thing their captain
doesn't realize is--
They've docked and come aboard.
Then I've risked all and lost.
I'll be in the escape pod.
If that wicker chair I like survives,
have it sent to my P.O. box.
I'm Leela, captain of
the Planet Express delivery ship.
We're pleading for assistance.
If there's--
I'm in command. Zapp Brannigan.
Has my fame preceded me,
or was I too quick?
Oh, not at all.
I'm just so really thrilled
to meet you.
You're an impressive captain,
beautiful and deadly.
-A potent combination.
-You don't mean that.
I haven't seen more than
three captains sexier than you.
Only one who was deadlier.
I heard you defeated a horde. . .
. . .of somethings
in the something system.
The Killbots?
Simply a matter of outsmarting them.
I never would've thought of that.
Killbots have a preset kill limit.
Knowing that, I sent wave
after wave of my own men at them. . .
. . .until they shut down.
Kif, show them the medal I won.
More, please. A little more.
More. Keep going.
We need to talk about our mission.
I'm willing to put wave after wave. . .
. . .of men at your disposal.
Right, men?
MAN:
You suck!
We're hoping to save the animals
of Vergon 6.
-If you could--
-Vergon 6!
-This dinner is over.
-What's wrong?
The Order of Planets prohibits
interfering with other worlds.
It's a little rule known
as "Brannigan's Law. "
People already interfered.
That planet was mined hollow.
By an Order of Planets mining crew.
This doesn't make any sense.
I don't pretend to understand
Brannigan's Law. I enforce it.
Fine, we'll save the animals alone.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
Guards!
-What just happened?
-He's throwing us in prison.
Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
Ow!
I might've liked Zapp if he
hadn't thrown me in prison.
You really are too picky.
Kif, follow me up to the deck.
I've got some musing to do.
Oh, jeez!
I'm facing a formidable
female adversary. Suggestions?
I fail to see any problem, sir.
You've imprisoned her
under directive B-1 0.81 .
You mean Brannigan's Law?
Right, that law.
-Which one?
-Brannigan's Law.
You're my best friend,
but you've earned my contempt again.
You should know, the way to deal. . .
. . .with a female adversary
is to seduce her.
-This time we are sure she's a woman?
-Yes!
Invite her to my quarters.
And have the boy lay out
my formal shorts.
The boy, sir?
You. You lay out my formal shorts.
The jackass wants to see you
in his quarters.
Now's my chance to reason
with him, captain to captain.
And he wants you to wear this.
ZAPP:
Come and get it!
Welcome to my humble chamber.
Or as I call it, "The Love-Nasium. "
-Cham-pag-in?
-You're such a coin-a-sewer.
Well, I have studied abroad. Or two.
-Captain, if we could speak seriously.
-Uh-huh.
Please let us rescue those animals.
Mm-hm.
I like your style.
I find it very erotic.
-What?
-Erotic!
Erotic! Erotic! Erotic!
We can escape. Just bend
the hatch off this steam pipe.
Hey, yeah!
FRY:
No! It's full of steam!
You look like a woman
who enjoys the finer things.
Come over here
and feel my velour bedspread.
I'm not in the mood.
Leela, it's real velour.
Just let yourself go.
Can I please just go back to prison?
You'd rather sit in prison
than spend time with the "Zapper"?
Much rather.
[ZAPP SNIVELS]
What are you doing?
Oh, God, I'm pathetic.
Sorry. Just go.
You want the cham-pag-in?
No. And it's pronounced "champagne. "
Oh, God, no!
It's not a big deal.
I get so lonely. I just thought
a fellow captain would understand.
Oh, forget it.
It's great ordering people around.
But through it all,
you're completely alone.
It comes with the job.
I'm just so lonely!
Oh, come on. Cheer up.
It's not that bad.
-Want to try escaping again?
-I'm comfy.
Leela's been gone a long time.
I hope she's making progress
with Zapp.
[SNORES]
Good morning, lover.
-Listen. . . .
-Now you're officially my woman.
Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
Last night was a mistake.
A sexy mistake.
No, just a regular mistake.
For a second my common sense
was overwhelmed by pity.
A second is all it takes.
That's why eventually you'll come
crawling back to the Zapper.
The only kind of crawling
I'm doing to you is away. . .from.
Leela, you're obviously
confused and aroused.
I'm going to Vergon 6 to save
those animals, like it or not!
I won't stop you.
Threaten all you-- What?
We both know you won't make it to
Vergon 6 before the craving sets in.
Then you'll come crawling back
for another taste of sweet candy.
Bam!
Ew.
-Kif?
-Yes-- Oh!
Yes, captain?
I have made it with a woman.
Inform the men.
The fatso says you're free to go.
-Really? Why?
-"Why," indeed.
-What was that?
-Nothing.
Should we go and head to the planet?
We just talked, okay?
We don't have much time. The planet
is supposed to collapse in--
Two hours ago.
Purple Fruit Snake. . . .
Purple Fruit Snake. . . .
Hello, there.
He's not on the list.
So we can cook him?
A barbecue!
I'll wear my funny apron!
No! I don't care about your apron,
we're not cooking him.
Ahhh.
I'll call him "Nibbler. "
Ahhh.
I'll fire up the grill.
I hope he'll be okay
with all those big animals.
Once my woman returns, I won't have
time to hang with the boys anymore.
That's a shame, sir.
So let's make the most
of our time together.
Never mind. Just give me a back rub.
I found some hermaphlamingos.
That's the last species.
Huh?
BENDER: Hey, what the--?
-Where'd they all go?
[BURPS]
Nibbler!
I can't believe we flew across
the galaxy and had a steam. . .
. . .to get lunch for him.
He's pending for a Bending.
It's not his fault
he's an unstoppable killing machine.
Is it, snookums?
The planet's kerr-ploding!
Prepare for liftoff.
We're out of fuel!
Bender, I told you to fill the tank.
I'll do it when we get back.
Lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.
Forget it!
I refuse to go crawling back to him.
What do you mean?
Nothing. We just talked.
So? It's not like you slept with him.
Oh, my God!
How could you, Leela?
I thought you had standards!
Jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!
Don't you think I feel
bad enough already?
No!
All right, I'll call him.
If living is that important to you.
--that's why you'll never
make captain.
Hello, Zapp?
-Well, well, well.
-Zapp, we're out of fuel.
Vergon 6 is about to implode.
We need help.
So, crawling back to the Big Z
like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
-Birds don 't crawl.
-They've been known to!
Are you gonna rescue us or not?
Can 't you ask a bit more sexfully?
Please, Big Z?
But first you have
to get rid of that thing.
That's the law.
Brannigan's Law is like
Brannigan's love. Hard and fast.
Now put that greasy rat outside
and we'll tow you.
I'd never abandon a helpless animal.
You know, once I thought you were
a pompous buffoon.
Then I realized that inside
you were a child.
Now I realize that outside
that child is a pompous buffoon!
And which one rocked your world?
[LEELA SIGHS]
Way to tell that guy off!
What's your escape plan?
I guess to sit here
and wait for death.
Can do!
[LOUD THUDDING]
What the hell was that?
Pew!
I don't believe it!
It's Dark Matter!
So this guy just unloaded
a steaming pile of starship fuel?
His species must've
filled the planet with it.
Did you do that, you cute little--?
That should be enough fuel
to get us out.
Bender, put it in the engine.
We made it!
And some of the animals survived!
So a couple animals didn't die
and Leela got lucky.
That's what I call
a successful mission.
We're heroes!
Dear diary: I didn't
find love on this mission. . .
. . .but I did find a cute little
companion who excretes fuel.
And that's just as good.
ZAPP:
Captain's journal, Stardate, uh. . . .
KIF:
April 1 3th.
ZAPP:
April 1 3th. Point-two.
We failed to uphold the law.
However, I did make it
with a hot alien babe.
And in the end, is that not
what man has dreamt of. . .
. . .since first he looked up
at the stars?
Kif, I'm asking you a question.
Oh.
What about the view, Fry?
It really puts things in perspective.
From up here, an entire world
can seem utterly insignificant.
Fear of a 'Bot Planet
Nice seats! We're close enough. . .
. . .to when you hit a player
with a bottle, he's down.
I don't get it. Is blernsball
the same as baseball?
Baseball? God forbid.
Face it, Fry. Baseball was
as boring as mom and apple pie.
-That's why they jazzed it up.
-Boring? Baseball wasn't--
So they finally jazzed it up.
Home run!
Right?
Out!
What happened? Why's the ball
on that spring?
It's tradition, like aluminum
bats and the seventh-inning grope.
I got me a souvenir!
Here you go, kid.
I'd like a jumbo squid log, please.
We don't sell those.
All right. Let me have
one of your young on a roll.
We're out of rolls.
Fine. Just give me something crawling
with parasites.
[GROWLS]
At least hot dogs didn't change.
-Buddies, who wants popcorn?
LEELA: I'll have some!
[POPPING]
Anyone want butter on that?
I'm getting the hang of this.
The blerns are loaded. . .
. . .count's 3 blerns, 2 anti-blerns,
and the blern rule's in effect, right?
Except for the word "blern,"
that's total gibberish.
MAN:
Multi-ball! Multi-ball!
MAN:
Blern! Blern!
All right! Yes!
Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns.
He's good, all right.
But he's no Clem Johnson.
And Johnson played back in the days
before steroids were mandatory.
That sack of skin wouldn't have lasted
one pitch in the old Robot Leagues.
Now, Wireless Joe Jackson,
there was a blern-hitting machine.
Exactly. He was a machine
designed to hit blerns.
Wireless Joe was
a programmable bat on wheels.
And I suppose pitching at 5000
was just a modified howitzer?
Humans are so scared of
robot competition. . .
-. . .you won't let us on the field.
-There's a lot of robots down there.
Yeah. Doing crap work.
They're batboys, ball polishers,
sprinkler systems.
But how many robot managers are there?
-Eleven?
-Zero!
And what a surprise!
Look who's scraping up the filth!
Is it a human child? I wish!
Whoa, dear Lord!
What's wrong?
It's my new pager.
This is Hermes.
A package just came in.
Return to the office immediately.
[GROANING]
Get away, you filthy bird.
Professor? Turn me off, quick!
I'm sorry. What?
See you at the office!
BENDER:
Admit it!
You think robots are just machines
built to make life easier.
Well, aren't they?
I've never made anyone's life easier,
and you know it!
Great news, everyone. You'll be
delivering a package to Chapek 9.
Where humans are killed on sight.
-Why is that great news?
-I'm glad you asked that question.
You see, Chapek 9 was colonized
centuries ago. . .
. . .by a murderous crew
of radical robot separatists.
Just because a robot wants to
kill humans, he's a "radical. "
Hold on. I understand
these robots hate humans.
But how do they feel
about humanoid aliens?
They're not fans.
Bender will have to make the delivery.
I get it.
Make the robot do all the work.
This is the first actual work
you've ever done here.
Well, I'm not doing it!
It's a robot holiday.
Really? Which one?
Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks
on the robot calendar.
Come on, Bender.
Last month, it was Robomadom.
And before that, Robonza.
-Man, that one was a blast.
-Not just a blast. . .
. . .it was a sacred tribute to my
ancestral prototypes. . .
. . .which took the form
of a drinking contest.
Bender, I respect your diversity
to the extent the law requires.
But you used all your days off
when you had Roberculosis.
All right, I'll go.
But I'll hold a grudge against
every last one of you. . .
. . .for the rest of your lives.
Well then, it's settled.
So long, everyone.
So, this planet is completely
uninhabited?
No. It's inhabited by robots.
Kind of like how a warehouse
is inhabited by boxes.
Okay, Bender. Time to get to work.
Yes, Ms. Leela.
Tote that space barge.
Lift that space bale.
We can't land on the surface,
the robots will kill us.
We'll stay and lower you
with the winch.
Remember, you don't know humans,
you don't work for humans. . .
. . .and above all,
you don't like humans.
I'll try to keep that in mind.
-He seems pretty angry.
-Yeah.
I'd be angry too, if I had to go
to an uninhabited planet.
Let's do something nice for him.
LEELA:
There.
This will show that stupid
robot we care.
[BEEPING]
Bender's done with the delivery,
I'm in trouble. They found out I
work with humans and--
Oh, no!
-My God! We have to rescue him.
-No, they'll kill us.
What will we do?
I don't know.
It's not an easy decision.
If only I had two or three minutes
to think.
To save Bender, we've got to look
and act exactly like robots.
I'm fully operational.
We have to walk and talk
like robots, and maybe. . .
. . .solve differential
equations like robots.
I can dance like a robot.
Will that help?
Fry. First of all, this is serious.
Second of all:
We look stupid. We should've
gotten store-bought costumes.
-But there's no Woolworth's nearby.
GUARD 1 : Halt!
Be you robot or human?
Robot we be.
Just two robots out roboting it up.
Heh?
Administer the test.
Which of the following
would you most prefer:
A: A puppy?
B: A pretty flower from your sweetie?
Or C: A large, properly formatted
data file?
Choose!
[WHISPERING]
-Is the puppy mechanical at all?
-No. It's the bad kind of puppy.
We'll go with the data file.
-Correct.
-The flower would've been acceptable.
GUARD 2:
You may pass.
LEELA: If you see robots,
stay out of their way.
LEELA:
So far, so good.
-Little to the right. Okay.
-Have you seen this robot?
Sorry. Can't help you.
Hey! Watch it!
Don't drop that there!
Oh!
Come on, Fry. Walk like a robot.
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-Robots don't have bathrooms.
Right. Where do they
smoke in high school?
Just go behind those garbage cans.
I'll stand guard.
[UNZIPS PANTS]
[HUMS]
Hurry up, Fry!
Sir? Are you aware you're leaking
coolant at an alarming rate?
-Let me patch you up with hot resin.
-I think the leak's stopping.
Wait. Wait.
Yeah, there we go.
Wait. Yeah.
What sort of robot turns down a free
blast of searing-hot resin?
Uh--
I'm sorry. My friend and I have to
do some mindless, repetitive tasks.
Sounds like a romantic evening.
I won't keep you.
[SNEEZES]
-Get the humanoids.
-Get the intruder.
ROBOT:
Intruder alert.
Quick! Let's duck in here!
ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this sound
file for an announcement:
A nonmetallic being is
in the vicinity of Make-Out Point.
Say, Wendy? Your chassis's scuffed.
Mind if I polish it for you?
Did you hear that?
It sounded like a human.
Relax, Wendy. Humans will never
come to our little town.
It's perfectly safe to
let our guard down.
I will eat and digest you all with
my system of mighty organs!
Behold!
Wow! The 3-D's great!
Mine's not working.
Funny, isn't it?
The human's impervious to our
powerful magnetic fields.
Yet in the end, he succumbed to
a harmless sharpened stick.
-I'm glad the nightmare's over.
-It'll never be over.
Even now, humans lurk in our
playgrounds, breezeways. . .
. . .perhaps even our movie theaters!
FRY:
God help us!
Okay. Keep an eye out for Bender.
What did you think of the movie?
Too much romance,
not enough human killing.
It was a real chick flick.
[FANFARE PLAYS]
What's that?
What do you mean, "What's that?"
It's 5:00.
Time for the daily human hunt.
Stay with the crowd so no one
sees how crummy you look.
-That was uncalled for.
-I'm over here.
I heard a human was draining coolant
behind garbage can 738.
I heard they unscrew our lug nuts at
night and eat them at brunches.
Welcome to a very special human hunt.
We have a guest whose
irrational hatred for humans. . .
. . .makes me look like
a human sympathizer.
[LAUGHING]
A newly-arrived refugee from Earth,
let's hear it for. . .
. . .Bender!
It's him! He's okay!
Death to the humans!
Ah, it's good to hear his voice.
Many said I was too extreme when I
called for. . .
. . .the annihilation of humans. . .
. . .as well as some of the more
cunning monkeys.
After living on Earth, I can tell
you that I am, if anything. . .
. . .too merciful.
[CHEERING]
My God! He's become evil.
I mean, eviler.
Thank you. And if you
enjoyed that diatribe. . .
. . .you'll want to purchase
my spoken-word album.
Just $1 8.95.
Act now, and you'll get this Bender
action figurine.
Bite my shiny metal ass.
Let the hunt begin!
Now, your basic human is between three
and 25 feet tall. . .
. . .and is made of a hairy, oily
goo in a T-shirt.
Do they bite you,
suck your fluid. . .
-. . .and you become human?
-Sure.
-Anything in the trap?
-Nothing.
Nothing.
Humans prefer low-calorie bait.
Well, that makes 1 46,000
unsuccessful hunts in a row.
But I've got a good feeling
about tomorrow.
Wait! What's that?
That's the abandoned
adult-book store.
Nothing there, except a few
shreds of old robot pornography.
Sounds like a breeding ground
for humans. I'll check it out.
Oh, yeah.
You're a bad girl, aren't you?
Psst, Bender!
What? Oh, you!
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.
We heard you were arrested
as a human sympathizer.
I was.
They let me go when I said
I killed a billion humans.
Good!
Let's get back to the ship.
-What for?
-We're rescuing you.
-I don't want that.
-Say what?
I love this planet.
I've got wealth, fame. . .
. . .and access to the depths of sleaze
from that.
But we're your friends.
Friends? That activates
my hilarity unit.
I'm a machine.
You're no more my friends. . .
. . .than you are with the toaster,
phonograph or electric chair.
That's not true.
Well, that's how it feels to me.
Bye, Bender. I'll miss you.
Go on. Get out of here
before you get caught.
Bender, good news.
Your album just went gold.
-What the--?
-It's the humans!
Bender, do something!
Got you! You murderous flesh piles!
Your Honor, I intend to demonstrate
beyond 0.5o/o of a doubt. . .
. . .that these humans are guilty
of the crime of being humans.
Come to think of it, I rest my case.
Thank you, prosecutor.
I will now consider the evidence.
Wait a minute.
Won't someone defend us?
Yeah! He may not have a case,
but I am genuinely not a human.
Quiet, human!
He froze up again.
Try control-alt-delete.
-Jiggle the cord.
-Turn him off and on.
-Clean the mouse.
-Call technical support!
Okay, okay, he's back online.
I find the defendants guilty.
No!
Look, one eye! Count them!
One! Not human!
The humans are sentenced to live
as robots live on Earth.
They'll perform tedious calculations
and spot-weld cars. . .
. . .until they become obsolete, and
given to an inner-city school.
Great work, Bender! You've taught us
to hate humans all over again!
Heh-heh. Oh. . . .
[SCREAMING]
[THUDDING]
LEELA: Are you all right?
FRY: Oh, yeah.
-Who are you?
-We are the Robot Elders.
You don't look old.
Thanks. We try to take care of
ourselves.
-What's going on?
-Silence! Bring in Bender!
Make this quick. I'm due
at a mini-mall opening.
Hey! What is this?
Silence! It's time to
kill the humans.
But the judge sentenced us!
Silence! That's just a show
for the public.
We rule this planet.
Handcarved from meteorites by robot
founders over four centuries ago.
Silence! Come forward, Bender.
You'll have the honor of execution.
Silence! I concur.
Here. Use the ceremonial
kill-a-ma-gig.
I'm a little tired right now.
Can I just give them
a savage beating?
No! The elders have spoken.
Show us the killing skills that
made you a media darling.
Do it! Kill them before
they bring down our society!
-Do it!
-Do it!
ALL: Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Oh.
[GASPING]
I can't kill them.
Plenty of humans have mistreated
robots, but not these two.
They're my friends.
Humans are no threat to us.
They're stupid, putrid cowards.
Damn right!
The fact is, humans are completely
harmless.
-We're well aware of that.
-You are?
We use them as scapegoats to distract
the public from their real problems.
Like our crippling lug nut shortage.
And a corrupt government of
robot elders.
That's for sure.
Quiet, Jimmy.
I'm glad that's out in the open.
We'll just let ourselves out.
Silence! You all know too much.
Elders? Execute function control,
shift, kill.
Stop!
Take one more step,
and I'll breathe fire on you!
He'll do it! He's crazy!
Did we make that up?
Gee, I can't remember anymore.
It might be from that stupid movie.
ROBOT ELDER:
The original or the remake?
Hey! They're getting away!
FRY:
So long, suckers!
Hello, suckers.
Hold on.
I forgot to deliver the package.
Lug nuts! Precious lug nuts!
Hooray for the humans!
I can't believe you guys
did this for me.
This is the best Robanukah ever!
We want you to know that we
respect your robot heritage.
Thanks. You know I made Robanukah up
to get out of work, right?
Of course.
That doesn't make it
less meaningful.
In that case, let the dancing begin!
[HEBREW MUSIC PLAYS]
Hey, you guys are good.
How the hell do you do that?
[SQUEAKING]
Ahh! I can't take it anymore!
They've been at it for hours!
Give it a rest, you two!
Sorry!
A Fishful of Dollars
[SNORES]
Good morning, class.
I trust you've prepared
for today's final exam.
Excuse me, I've missed a few lectures.
What subject is this?
Ancient Egyptian algebra.
What a nightmare!
Mr. Fry, are those your underpants?
Young man, it's time
you learned a lesson ...
... about Lightspeed-brand briefs.
ANNOUNCER: Lightspeed fits an active
lifestyle, whether you're working...
...or having fun.
Lightspeed. Style and comfort
for the discriminating crotch.
Oh! What a weird dream.
I'll never get back to sleep.
You say they broadcast
commercials into people's dreams?
-Of course.
-How is that possible?
FARNSWORTH:
It's very simple.
The ad gets into your brain just like
this liquid gets into this egg.
Although in reality, it's not liquid,
but gamma radiation.
That's awful! It's like brainwashing.
-Weren't there ads in your time?
-Well, sure. But not in our dreams.
Only on TV and radio,
and in magazines ...
... and movies, and at ball games
and on buses ...
... and milk cartons,
and bananas and written in the sky.
But not in dreams. No, sirree.
Quit squawking.
Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
We all have commercials
in our dreams.
We don't run off to buy brand-name
merchandise at low, low prices.
Care to sample our fragrance
from Calvin Clone?
No, thanks.
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
-And you, sir?
-No, thanks--
COSMETOLOGIST:
What a lovely face!
We just need to draw attention away
from the eye area.
[ZAPPING]
[GROANS]
Cool!
Can I try these on?
I can't let you open
the package.
But you can try on the demo pair.
[GRUNTS]
Ooh! Ho, ho, ho.
Hi, Bender. Great new sweater.
New?! What sweater?
I came here with it.
I don't know you people.
$30, please.
$30! I can't afford that.
Unless ...  . Do you take Visa?
Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
-American Express?
-600 years.
-Discover card?
-Sorry, we don't take Discover.
Hey! You buying Lightspeeds?
Pretty ritzy.
No. I can't afford them.
Being poor sucks.
They advertise things nobody
can afford.
[MUSIC PLAYS]
Quiet! There's an ad coming on.
Hello, shoppers. It's me, Mom.
Who's the rocker jockey?
It's Mom, the world's most huggable
industrialist.
When my robots start to squeak
like an old screen door...
... that's when I reach for a can
of "Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil. "
BENDER:
Tasty.
And remember, Mom's oil is made
with 10% more love...
... than the next leading brand.
ANNOUNCER: "Mom", "Iove", and "screen
door" are trademarks of Mom Corp.
[BENDER SQUEAKS]
Sounds like you could use
a little of that oil.
-I'm boned!
-Freeze, scuzzbot!
There's obviously been
some sort of a mistake here.
I'm sure there's--
I say, I'm sure there's--
[CANS FALLING]
That is, I'm sure there's ...
... a very reasonable ...  .
Do we have enough money
to pay Bender's fine?
78, 79, 79.50 ...  .
Crud! We're 50 cents short.
I'd love to chip in,
but Bender stole my wallet.
FRY:
That's my old bank!
Maybe my account's still open.
We don't have your retina scan,
fingerprint or colonic map on file.
I did open the account over 1 000 years
ago. What about my ATM card?
Remember your PIN number?
It's the price of a pizza and soda
where I used to work, Pinucci's Pizza.
Okay. You had a balance of 93 cents.
All right!
And at 2 percent interest
over a period of 1 000 years ...
... that comes to 4.3 billion dollars.
[HYPERVENTILATES]
HERMES: To Fry!
AMY: Cheers!
I know Fry's rich, but do we
have to wear these hats?
Maybe you don't understand
just how rich he is.
In fact, I think I better
put on a monocle.
FRY: Pizza dinner on me!
GROUP: All right!
Just keep the tab
under 50 million dollars.
I haven't got all day.
What kind of pizza you guys want?
We'll have one with everything
but anchovies.
And one with my all-time favorite,
anchovies.
Invalid selection.
What are you talking about?
You know, those little headless fish.
Does not compute. Does not compute.
I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has
been extinct since the 2200s.
-What?!
-Oh, my, yes. Fished to death.
About the time your people
arrived, wasn't it, Zoidberg?
I'm not on trial here.
So none of you ever had anchovies?
You don't know what you're missing.
They're salty and oily,
and they melt in your mouth--
Stop! I admit it!
My people ate them all!
We kept saying, "One more can't hurt,"
and then they were gone. We're sorry!
I wish I could show you
how great they were.
I'm rich, but I can't buy back
things I miss from the 20th century.
Maybe you're forgetting
how rich you are.
Huh? Huh?
Yeah!
Hmm?
What do you think?
I know you spent a lot of money,
but it's awfully primitive.
The floors are made of such hard wood.
Hey, get a load
of this pathetic 20th-century TV!
What's wrong?
Besides causing eye cancer, they
had a lousy, low-definition picture.
True. On this TV, I bet you couldn't
even make out my obscene tattoo.
That's cute.
-Sold!
-Yes!
I just don't get it.
Who was this Ted Danson?
Why would you pay $1 0,000
for his skeleton?
-I have an idea for a sitcom.
-Leave him alone, Leela.
So he's going wacko with
his money. It's okay.
You're just saying that because he
bought you that antique robot toy.
Yeah. It is cute.
Now our final item.
This unopened can ...
... of Angry Norwegian-brand
anchovies, circa 1997.
Anchovies!
The last known can in existence,
guaranteed fresh and edible.
Do I hear $1 0,000?
-1 5,000!
-20!
-30. No, 40!
-50,000!
[MURMURING]
-Are you crazy? It's a can of fish.
-Don't tell me how to spend my money.
-50. Going once, twice--
WOMAN: 75,000.
Oh, my God, it's Mom!
I've never seen her in person before.
1 00,000!
You can't bid against Mom.
She's the richest
person in the world.
And she's so adorable.
Well, I suppose I could go
as high as ...  300,000!
-500!
-Oh, mercy be. A million.
-Two. Fourteen.
-Six.
I can see the nice young man
really wants those little fish.
Nevertheless, I'll bid 23 million.
One jillion dollars!
Sir, that's not a number.
In that case, 50 million.
Well, boys. Your old mother knows
when she's been beat.
You win, young man.
I tip my bonnet to you.
MAN:
Isn't she sweet?
What a class act! Sold!
To the gentleman who bought every
item in today's auction.
CROWD:
Boo!
Now for some good old
20th-century TV.
Ahh!
ANNOUNCER:
Do you remember when cookies...
...came fresh from the oven?
Petridge Farm remembers.
Oh, those were the days.
Remember when women couldn't vote...
...and certain folk weren't allowed
on golf courses?
Petridge Farm remembers.
[KNOCKING]
LEELA:
Fry, are you there?
You haven't been to work in days.
What are you doing?
Sitting right here. I picked up my
life where I left off 1 000 years ago.
Now if you'll excuse me, it's 8:00.
Time to get busy.
[SIR MIX-A-LOT'S
"BABY GOT BACK" PLAYS]
You can't just sit here
listening to classical music.
I could if you hadn't
shut off the stereo.
This isn't healthy.
You're living in the past.
I'm rich.
I can live whenever I want.
But we're your friends,
and we live here in the year 3000.
Now, are you gonna come
to the squid fight with us ...
... or sit here wallowing
in your prehistoric junk?
Junk?
Maybe you can't understand this ...
... but I finally found what I need
to be happy. Things, not friends.
I'm a thing.
Just leave me alone.
Fry, please!
[KNOCKING]
My ponytail's caught in the door.
I don't need them.
I have my antique videos
and my bucket of fossilized KFC ...
... and 50 million dollars
worth of anchovies.
Mercy me. What a day.
Could you shut the door, Edner dear?
I think I feel a draft coming on.
Holy crap! That bastard's itchy!
Walt! Cream soda!
Right away.
Larry, get your mother a cream soda.
But Mom said--
You heard me.
-What's wrong, Mommy?
-It's those damned anchovies!
That dirtbag Fry
must know their secret.
And I won't rest until I get
my hands on them.
No one messes with Mom.
[LAUGHING MANIACALLY]
Quiet, you!
As you know, one of the
cornerstones of my empire ...
... is Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.
Think of it. Ten billion robots ...
... each one needing an oil change
every 3000 miles.
You don't have to do the math to know
that's a buttload of oil!
Can I wear your suit?
-No, Edner! Put that down!
-Oh.
What's oil have to do
with anchovies?
I'm getting to the freaking anchovies.
One drop of the anchovy's
natural oil ...
... would lubricate 1 0 robots
permanently.
It's a shame they're extinct.
No, it isn't! Shut your filthy clam!
Thank you, Walt.
If anyone ever got hold
of anchovy DNA ...
... they could stick
the oil-making gene ...
... in a bunch
of Third-World kids, and bam!
Cheap, effective robot oil.
Enough to put dear old Mom
out of business.
My God! This Mr. Fry must be
a mastermind of the highest order.
[THEME FROM SANFORD AND SON PLAYS]
MAN:
Esther, you ugly!
We have only one option.
We'll bankrupt Mr. Fry so he'll
have to sell the anchovies to us!
Mother, you are one clever old skag.
And don't you forget it.
But how do we get
Fry's money out of the bank?
That'll be easy,
thanks to the nice people ...
... at Mom's Old Fashioned
Video Surveillance Unit.
Remember your PIN number?
It's the price of a pizza and soda
where I used to work, Pinucci's Pizza.
It's the price of a pizza and soda--
-You know what needs to be done.
-What?
Get his PIN number, you idiots!
Now I'm off to some charity B.S.
for knocked-up teenage sluts.
[KNOCKING]
WALT: Mr. Fry, it's those three
plumbers you called for.
LARRY:
We're here to tighten your drains.
[SLAPPING]
I didn't order any--
Quick! Give him the tranquilizer!
That's a good boy.
Wake up, Mr. Fry.
Where am l?
You're in the good old year 2000,
working at Pinucci's Pizza.
You fell asleep on the job.
That sounds like me.
But I thought I got frozen.
Wasn't I in the future?
No. You only dreamed
you were in the year 3000.
So I'm really back?
That's exactly what I wanted, I guess.
-Who are you?
-I'm Mr. Pinucci.
You are? Did you grow a mustache
since last night?
No! Go work the currency register.
I think I hear a customer coming.
I said, I think I hear
a customer coming!
Oh, hurry. I want to get
back to the head museum.
Don't worry.
This won't take long.
Your motivation is you're back in 2000
and your head's still on your body ...
... and you want a cheese pizza.
I'm only doing this so people will
take my head seriously as an actress.
Hey, look. Anchovies.
Of course. They're not extinct yet.
And if you need more proof that
this is really 1 000 years ago ...
... well, here's contemporary actress,
Pamela Anderson.
Ooh.
Hello, Fry. Remember me from
Baywatch: The Movie?
Uh ...  .
It was the first movie to be shot
entirely in slow motion!
It hasn't been made yet.
-Then he doesn't know I won the Oscar?
-Nope.
Wait! You're Pamela Anderson!
Cool! What can I get you?
I'll have a cheese pizza
and a large ...  .
-Line!
-Soda!
Oh, right!
Cheese pizza and a large soda.
Cheese and a--
-That was quick.
-So, what do I owe you?
$1 0.77, same as my PIN number.
Hey, you don't get to laugh.
Thanks a billion!
More like 4.3 billion.
-Ow!
-Ow!
I had a nightmare. I was in the year
2000 and you guys never existed.
I'm so glad I'm awake now
and you're here.
So you care about us?
You only care about anchovies
and stuffy old songs about buttocks.
No, that's not true!
Goodbye!
Whee!
ANNOUNCER: This dream brought to you
by Lightspeed!
Bender! Leela! Don't leave me!
Wait a minute.
Buddy, what year is this?
Uh, 3000.
3000? Yes! I'm still in the future!
Life is wonderful!
What are you doing
with my stuff?
Check bounced.
We're taking it all back.
Oh, no. My ATM card!
My secret PIN number, 1 077.
I've got nothing left.
Except ...
You're Fry's relative. Do you know
how he got so crazy?
What?
They say madness runs in our family.
Some even call me mad.
And why?
Because I dared to dream
of my own race of atomic monsters!
Atomic supermen
with octagonal-shaped bodies ...
... that suck blood out of ...  .
Leela! Bender! I missed you so much.
You did? What happened?
I was robbed.
They got everything except these.
Who did?
Hello, Fry.
It's Mom!
I felt terrible when I heard
about your money troubles.
I thought I could help out a sweet,
young man by buying his anchovies.
Sorry, but they
aren't for sale.
What? Listen, you little bastard!
I control the robot-oil business!
I won't let you ruin me!
How much?
Put that checkbook away, because I've
discovered something more important.
My friends. And they aren't worth
even a penny to me.
That's why these anchovies
are going on a pizza ...
... so I can share the food I love
with the people I like.
Holy hell! You're going
to eat them?
Well, just make sure you eat them all.
You're a growing boy.
Toodle-loo!
-Dumb ass.
-What a nice lady!
Okay, my friends.
Get ready for the most delicious
extinct animal you've ever tasted.
I don't know. I've had cow.
Gross!
Mmm.
No one likes them at first.
They'll grow on you.
That stench! That heavenly stench!
More.
There's no more.
There never will be.
More! More!
More!
BENDER SINGS:
Going through the car wash
Come on y'all and sing it with me
Car wash
Car wash, yeah
Ah!
Oh!
My Three Suns
I'm Elzar, welcome to the show.
You don 't have to drive to Neptune
for great Neptunian food.
We'll kick it up a notch
as I show you how to fricassee...
...a mouthwatering Neptunian slug.
While you grease the pan and
preheat your oven to 3500 degrees...
...separate the yolk from your
enhanced eggplant...
...and give it a blast
from your spice weasel. Bam!
FRY:
Hey, what you watching?
-Nothing.
-Is that a cooking show?
No, of course not.
It was porno. Yeah, that's it!
I didn't know you liked cooking.
That's so cute.
It's true.
I've been hiding it for so long.
-It's okay. I like cooking too.
-Pansy.
Your most important ingredient
is this baby...
... the Neptunian slug.
You can get it in a can.
But to do things right...
... you gotta strangle yourself
a fresh one.
[SLUG GURGLES]
This is why you always want to use
cast-iron cookware.
[SLUG GURGLES]
It has come to my attention ...
. . .that we're paying you
to loaf on the couch.
You call that a couch?
I demand a pillow!
If you want to continue
to earn a salary ...
... you gotta do more than watch
cooking shows all day.
-You're gonna be the ship's cook?
-We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
I know you like cooking shows, but you
are a robot without a sense of taste.
I wouldn't talk about taste,
wearing a lime-green tank top.
Bam!
-This is Little Neptune?
-Yep.
This is the place to get
exotic, gourmet ingredients.
Among other things.
Come on, man, don't hold out
on me like this.
You want to buy organ?
Fresh. Ready for transplant.
What's this?
X-ray eye. See through anything.
Wait. This says "Z RAY. "
Z is better.
It is two more than X.
That would be an advantage.
Do you take cash?
Be more careful.
You're not in the 20th century.
-You don't know how things work.
-I'm not a kid.
I grew up in this city.
These are my people.
-What up?
-Word.
You guys sell every meat except human.
You want human?
What's this spice for?
Swamp root, makes you irresistible
to the opposite sex.
That's ridiculous.
I'll take two pounds.
I'm looking for fresh slug.
-Yellow or purple?
-Whatever!
Purple causes diarrhea.
Either one is fine.
Have you seen Fry?
I do have trouble breathing underwater
sometimes. I'll take the gills.
Yes, gills.
You don't need lungs anymore.
Can't imagine why I would.
I take lungs now.
Gills come next week.
Nurse!
Let's do it!
You may feel small pain.
Thank you.
What were you doing?
I said to stay away from them.
Did you ever stop to think
I might be happier with gills?
-Good news.
-I don't like the sound of that!
You'll be making a delivery
to the planet Trisol.
A mysterious world in the darkest
depths of the Forbidden Zone.
Thank you and good night!
Are we even allowed
in the Forbidden Zone?
Of course. It's just a name.
Like the Death Zone,
or the Zone of No Return.
All the zones have names like that
in the Galaxy of Terror.
-Professor--
-Off you go. Pleasant trip.
-Bender, how's dinner coming?
-Almost ready.
[BENDER HUMS]
Ah! Now for a dash of salt.
[BENDER HUMS]
This is Bender's first meal.
He's a bit sensitive.
Let's be supportive.
-All right!
FRY: Okay!
Oh, dear God!
That's the saltiest thing
I ever tasted.
I once ate a bowl of salt.
Is this salt water?
It's salt with water in it.
My vision's fading. I'm dying.
There was nothing wrong with it.
The salt level was 1 0o/o less
than a lethal dose.
I shouldn't have had seconds.
Here's the package to deliver.
For once in your life, be careful.
This is my first visit to the Galaxy
of Terror. I want it to be nice.
-Ow!
-Don't touch anything.
Go to the palace
and come right back.
I was delivering things
before you were born.
I think I know what I am doing.
[SMACKS LIPS]
Stupid slug.
I've never been so thirsty.
Come on, go down already.
Ah!
[PANTS]
Hello. Anybody home?
[SLURPS]
The royal bottle is empty.
You drank our emperor.
No! It wasn't me!
[BURPS]
You drank our emperor.
You assassinated him.
He looked so cool and refreshing.
I am sure he was.
But now he's gone
and your fate is sealed.
All hail the new emperor.
ALL:
Hail! Hail! Hail!
After I specifically asked you
not to touch anything. . .
. . .you drank strange blue liquid?
It could've been poisonous.
Chances were equally
good it was an emperor.
I am Merg, the high priest.
If I might interject?
-You might.
-I humbly advise. . .
. . .you choose a prime minister.
I suggest Gorgak,
the previous appointee.
I will be a forceful administrator.
I've thought
of becoming a prime minister.
-I gotta go with Bender.
-In your face, Gorgak.
That's it. As your captain,
I order you back to the ship.
Gee, I better check
with my prime minister.
Stay the course, pal.
A package came for you.
Hey, thanks.
This got here just in time.
This is your harem.
You may choose any of these maidens
to be your consort.
How about that one?
I didn't know you
were into that sort of thing.
On second thought,
I'll take that one.
I'm not here to pass judgment.
Does anyone else think it's odd
that a 25-year-old delivery boy. . .
. . .could kill the emperor
and be rewarded, not punished?
Don't beat around the bush.
We know who you mean.
Me, right?
Don't worry. These people seem
really mild-mannered.
They are mild.
You're soaking in one right now.
You touched me in ways
I've never been touched before.
Ah! There you are.
Time to prepare
for tomorrow's coronation.
A fancy-dress gala!
I'll wear my formal shell.
He'll be enthroned
with the setting of the three suns. . .
. . .when we enter our nocturnal phase.
Will there be a lot of speeches?
One. The absolutely flawless
recitation. . .
. . .from memory of the royal oath,
by you.
Will there be cake?
Hi.
There you go.
Get ready to laugh
till your sides leak. . .
. . .with our planet's foremost
political satirist. . .
. . .Flof.
What's up with people
from under the orange sun?
They're all:
[GUTTURAL SOUNDS]
But us guys from under the red sun,
we're like:
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Right? Am I right?
Yeah, he is right!
I have to talk to you.
You're in danger.
LEELA:
You see Emperor Plon here?
He met his end when
drunk by Emperor Strug.
And before he could even
wipe his mouth. . .
. . .Strug was drunk by Shwab.
-So?
-Look!
Do you know what the average
length of their reigns was?
-Eighty thousand years?
-No, one week.
I knew you wouldn't ask unless
it was really high or low.
Every emperor ascended to power
by assassinating the previous one.
And guess who's next?
My assassin will get his.
You're in tremendous danger!
Half of them were drunk
at their coronation.
I plan on having
a few brewskis myself.
No, they were assassinated.
You'll be killed
if you fail to recite the oath.
-I'll thumb through that later.
-That's so reckless.
-Don't you ever think ahead?
-If I did, I wouldn't be emperor.
I wouldn't be here in 3000.
Like the story of the grasshopper
and octopus.
All year the grasshopper kept
burying acorns for winter. . .
. . .while the octopus watched TV.
FRY: The winter came
and the grasshopper died.
The octopus ate his acorns
and got a race car.
Is any of this
getting through to you?
Oh, I give up!
This time
I won't be able to save you.
I told you 1 00 times
to stop treating me like a baby.
Go gather your nuts,
you nagging grasshopper.
That's it!
I'll never help you again!
If anyone except you needs me,
I'll be in the ship.
It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.
[SLURPING]
Quit it!
People of Trisol, it is my honor
to present your new emperor.
[CLEARS THROAT]
What up?
-Stick to the oath.
-Right.
I, Fry, who drank
Bont the Viscous. . .
. . .who drank Ungo the Moist. . .
. . .who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant. . .
. . .who slurped Hudge the Dewy. . .
. . .who had a soup
of Throm the Chunky. . .
. . .do solemnly swear
to rule with honor and. . .
. . .insanity. Integrity.
Congratulations, Your Highness.
I now present you
with your royal unisex robe.
Long live Fry the Solid.
The suns are setting. I can finally
switch to hard liquor.
Ah!
Check out the glowing freaks.
It's beautiful. Hey, what's that?
[GASPING]
The emperor Bont! He's still alive.
Of course I'm alive. Cut this
creep open and drain me out.
My tummy hurts.
They're running up the stairs!
Shut up, you!
MERG: Let us in! Fry must die
so that Bont may live.
What'll I do?
We gotta get the emperor out
before they kill you.
I'll spin you
in a high-speed centrifuge. . .
. . .separating out His Highness.
-Won't that crush my bones?
-The bones.
I always forget about the bones.
Sweat him out.
I refuse to be dripped out
through somebody's armpit.
I can vomit or urinate. How's that?
My favorite so far
is the bone-crushing.
-What about crying?
-That's a great idea!
That or the bone one.
Keep it up, men.
The veneer is starting to peel.
GORGAK:
Oh, dear.
I want to cry,
but I'm just too macho.
I'll make you cry, buddy.
You're a pimple on society's ass!
You'll never amount to anything!
I was emperor of a planet.
True. Here's a disturbing reminder:
Everyone you knew or loved
in the 20th century is dead.
These things happen.
Grab a Kleenex for this one:
There is no God, and your human
ideals are laughable!
Phew! That's a load off my mind.
Man, I guess it's harder than
I thought to make someone cry.
-You did your best.
-Up yours, bimbo.
We're in hot butter.
We should call Leela for help.
Cram it, lobster!
That is a good idea. I'll call her.
She's still mad
that I told her never to help me.
Leela is not the type
to hold a grudge.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
OPERATOR: Collect call from:
BENDER: I won 't give my name to you.
I'll accept.
Fry needs help.
We don't like each other.
-I like you.
-You do?
Are you gonna help?
I don 't know why I should.
Wait, wait. What is it
you like best about me?
-Is she coming?
-I'm not sure.
But I do know she likes
my in-your-face attitude.
[GASPING]
What the hell is that?
It's the Juice-A-Matic 4000.
It'll strain my juices from you
and filter pulp:
Your shredded remains.
Why didn't I think of that?
This is the saddest day of my life.
And I still can't cry!
Wait. Here comes Leela!
They have her totally outnumbered!
She's risking her life for me
after the way I treated her?
I don't deserve this.
I feel terrible.
You do?
-Is she all right?
-I don't know.
Perhaps I'll look out this window.
Dear God! They're swarming all over.
No!
What are you talking about? She's--
They are strapping her to the juicer.
They're putting some ice cubes
in that glass under it.
This can't be happening.
It can. And for all you know, it is.
I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
[CRIES]
All she ever wanted to do was help me.
And I was too proud and stupid
to accept it.
I wish I had died instead of her.
LEELA:
What are you talking about?
-You're alive!
-Of course I am.
I said you were dead
so he'd cry out the emperor.
You wrecked it by surviving.
We only got two drops.
[THUMP ON DOOR]
What the--?
[EMPEROR LAUGHS]
It's only a matter of time.
I'll handle this.
I think I can get us out of this
if you're willing to let me help.
Thanks, Leela.
I'll take all the help
you'll give.
I know you want what's best for me.
Ow!
What's that for?
Come on!
-That hurt.
-I know.
Amy, get the bottle.
Ow!
-Now I understand.
-Come on, everybody help Fry.
[CRIES]
Thanks, everybody. I love you all.
You guys are true--
Cut it out, Bender.
That's a tender area.
-How we doing, Amy?
-We're 1 /1 0 of the way there.
[SOBS]
[PANTS]
Okay, it's your turn.
Wait a minute. Who are you?
I'm the emperor.
Thanks for crying me out.
You're welcome.
FRY: Oh! Ooh! Aw! Ow!
BENDER: Save some for me.
FARNSWORTH:
Good news, everyone.
Tomorrow, you'll make a delivery
to Ebola Nine, the virus planet.
-Why can't they go today?
-Tonight's special.
I want you all to be alive.
It's the Academy of Inventors
annual symposium.
-Wow! I love symposia!
-The scientific event of the season.
Every member presents an invention.
The best one wins the Academy prize.
-Sounds boring.
-Oh, my, yes. But not this year. . .
. . .because my latest invention
is unbeatable.
Behold, the Death Clock.
Jam your finger in the hole.
This readout. . .
. . .tells you how long
you have to live.
-Does it really work?
-Sometimes it's off by seconds. . .
-. . .what with free will and all.
-Cool. How long do I have to live?
Dibs on his CD player!
A Big Piece of Garbage
FARNSWORTH:
Oh, my, yes.
-Who's the nerd?
-That's me at the first symposium.
I'm the Academy's
oldest living member.
-These youngsters look up to me.
-Well, well, well.
Look who's showing his wrinkled face.
-Just leave me alone, Wernstrom.
-You're over the hill, Farnsworth.
Leave science to the 1 20-year-olds.
You think you know everything.
I invented things when you
were barely turning senile.
Go home before you
embarrass yourself, old man.
Now excuse me. I'm taking
a nap before the ceremonies.
Who's that jerk?
He was my most promising student
1 00 years ago, at Mars University.
But then, after one
fateful pop quiz. . . .
A-minus? No one gives
Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
I'm sorry, but penmanship counts.
I swear I'll have my revenge
if it takes me 1 00 years.
And here it is, slightly over
99 years later and still no revenge.
I'm essentially in the clear.
I've been perusing your
fortified wine list. . .
. . .and I've selected
the '71 Hobo's Delight. . .
. . .the '57 Chateau Par-Tay,
and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
Exquisite choices, sir.
And mix them all together
in a big jug.
Welcome to this year's symposium.
I'm your host, Ron Popeil. . .
. . .inventor of Mr. Microphone,
the Spray-on Toupee. . .
. . .and the technology
to keep heads alive in jars.
Wait, there's more.
We've got many inventors tonight. . .
. . .starting with that up-and-coming
young star, Ogden Wernstrom.
-Boo!
-More wine!
Distinguished members of the Academy,
I present the Reverse Scuba Suit.
Observe.
Fetch!
Now, sit.
I said sit! Bad fish!
[APPLAUSE]
Don't worry. It's no competition
for your Death Clock.
What will you be presenting, grandpa?
It'll put you young whippersnappers
in your place.
I hope it's not as lame as
last year's Death Clock.
-Last year?
-That's right.
Oh, my.
-Did it put you youngsters in place?
-Hardly.
We laughed until our teeth fell out.
Come along, Cinnamon.
I have to invent something new
in the next 1 0 minutes.
Perhaps some sort of Death Clock!
Uh, professor?
[PROPELLER ENGINES WHIRLING]
-Very nice.
-Amazing!
Our last presentation comes from
our oldest member, Hubert Farnsworth.
Professor?
Just a second. Just a second.
Pencils down, prune-face.
Here I am. Now, hello there.
We all know telescopes
allow us to see distant objects. . .
. . .but what if we want to smell
those objects? Well, now we can.
Thanks to my new invention. . .
. . .the Smell-O-Scope.
The odor travels past this coffee
stain here. Around the olive pit. . .
. . .and into this cigar burn.
And this appears to be a. . .
. . .doodle of myself as a cowboy.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
But the Smell-O-Scope is brilliant!
Think of the astronomical odors
you'll smell, thanks to me!
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Oh, my.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
I've waited 1 00 years for this.
I give your invention
the worst grade imaginable:
An A-minus-minus!
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Now for the presentation of the award.
I'm practically giving this away to. . .
. . .Dr. Wernstrom,
for his fish thingy.
[FARNSWORTH SNIFFS]
Perhaps 1 49 is just too old
to be a scientist.
-Yep.
-No, professor! Don't give up!
There were many times in my century
when I never gave up.
Never.
Are you even listening to me?
Oh, I give up.
By God, you're right!
I'm going to build that Smell-O-Scope!
FARNSWORTH:
Eureka!
FRY:
Did you build it?
No, I remembered that I
built one last year!
Go ahead, try it.
You'll find that every heavenly
body has its own scent.
Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.
[FRY SNIFFS]
-Smells like strawberries.
-Exactly.
And now, Saturn.
Pine needles. Man, this is great!
As long as you don't make me
smell Uranus.
-I don't get it.
-I'm sorry, Fry.
Astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to
end that stupid joke once and for all.
-What's it called now?
-Urectum.
Here, let me locate it for you.
No, I think I'll just
smell around over here.
[FRY SNIFFS]
[FRY GAGS]
What is it?
Oh, jeez! Oh, man!
Remarkable! A stench so foul
it's right off the funkometer!
Fry may have discovered the smelliest
object in the known universe!
Oh! Name it after me!
I think it's moving.
Perhaps the computer
can calculate its trajectory.
My God! It's headed straight for us!
With enough force to reduce
this city to a stinky crater!
We have less than 72 hours.
Well, let's get looting.
[BENDER WHISTLES]
This thing will destroy
the whole city?
What the heck is it?
Just as I thought!
The answer lies in this movie
I found on the Internet.
NARRATOR:
New York City. The year 2000.
The most wasteful society
in history...
... was running out of places to bury
its never-ending output of garbage.
The landfills were full.
New Jersey was full.
Under cover of darkness, the city
put its garbage out to sea...
...on the world's largest barge.
[MAN WHISTLES]
The repulsive barge circled
the oceans for 50 years...
...but no country would accept it.
Not even that really filthy one.
You know the one I mean.
Finally, in 2052, the city used its
mob connections to obtain a rocket...
...and launch the garbage
into outer space.
Some experts claim the ball
may return to Earth.
But their concerns were dismissed
as "depressing. "
You got that off the Internet? In my
day it was only used to download porn.
Actually, that's still true.
Now that the garbage
is in space...
...perhaps you can help me
with my sexual inhibitions.
With gusto.
Aw!
That's it. Due to the
short-sightedness of Old New York. . .
. . .New New York will be
destroyed by a ball of garbage.
What the hell were you people
thinking then?
-How could you throw your garbage out?
-Give me a break.
-What do you do with it?
-We recycle.
-Robots are made from old beer cans.
-And this can's made from old robots.
That sandwich is made
of discarded sandwiches.
-Nothing just gets thrown away.
-The future is disgusting.
Typical 20th-century attitude.
You've no right to criticize
my century.
We invented the light bulb, steamboat
and cotton gin.
-Those are from the 1 9th century.
-They probably just copied us.
Please! There's no time for this now!
This is an emergency!
We must warn the mayor!
Garbage ball, huh?
That sounds serious.
Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
I hope this isn't a fraud like
global warming or second-hand smoke.
Send in my science adviser.
-Wernstrom!
-Well, well, well.
Come to present your latest napkin?
I'm here because a giant trash ball
is heading straight for us.
Smell for yourself.
Hey! Holy jeez!
That smell could be anything. . .
. . .a faulty stench coil,
cheese on the lens, who knows?
We just got this transmission
from Neptune!
RECORDED VOICE:
Giant garbage ball...
...passed close by.
Horrible stench!
[RECORDED VOICE GAGS]
The transmission ends there, sir.
[RECORDED VOICE GAGS]
No, I guess it keeps going.
[RECORDED VOICE GAGS AND STOPS]
-There we go.
-My God!
The senile old man is right!
-Do you mean him or me?
-Him!
Next, New New York in crisis.
Morbo?
Thanks, human female.
Puny earthlings were shocked
to learn that garbage...
... will destroy their pathetic city.
-I'm glad we live here in Los Angeles.
-Morbo agrees.
[NEWSCASTERS LAUGH]
-Can't we shoot a missile at it?
-The supercomputer's simulation. . .
. . .shows that the ball is too gooey.
Missiles would go through it.
But suppose we sent a crew to plant
an explosive on the fault line. . .
. . .between this mass of coffee grounds
and this deposit of AOL floppy disks?
In theory, it could work.
But you'll never find a crew willing
to go on such a suicidal mission.
Oh, crap!
FARNSWORTH: You only have one chance
to destroy the ball.
After that, it'll be so close
that blowing it up. . .
. . .would cause garbage to rain
on the entire planet. . .
-. . .killing billions.
-Boo-hoo.
Here's the bomb I've prepared.
Once activated, you have
25 minutes to get away.
-That's all--?
-Now, now.
We'll discuss your objections
when and if you return.
Odor at magnitude eight.
[CREW GAGS]
Magnitude 1 2.
Magnitude 31 !
We're breaking up!
Turn on the anti-smell device!
[DEVICE HISSES]
FRY:
Sporty.
-Wow!
LEELA: Look at all this filth.
FRY:
It's not filth.
It's a monument to 20th-century
achievements.
Look! A real Beanie Baby!
A Mr. Spock collector's plate!
[PLATE BREAKS]
Some Bart Simpson dolls!
BART DOLL: Eat my shorts.
-Okay!
Mmm, shorts!
This was garbage when it was new.
Let's blow it up already.
This junk isn't garbage!
I can dig anywhere. . .
. . .and find something great.
[FRY CHOKES]
All right, let's get to work.
Let's see.
If that's Hypodermic Ridge,
then the bomb goes right here.
Get ready. We've got 25 minutes.
"Fifteen minutes. "
"Five minutes. Six-H minutes"?
There's your problem. The professor
put the counter on upside down.
That idiot! It wasn't set for
25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.
[FRY SCREAMS]
-We're gonna die! Right?
-Right.
It's gonna blow!
Hey! You'll put somebody's eye out!
Okay, keep your space pants on.
I'll take care of this.
[EVERYONE SIGHS]
-We're saved.
-Yeah, but the ball's unstoppable now.
New New York is done for.
[SCRATCHING SOUND]
All in all, this is one day
Mittens the Kitten won 't soon forget.
Kittens give Morbo gas.
In lighter news, the city of
New New York is doomed.
Blame rests with human
Hubert Farnsworth...
...and his tiny inferior brain.
Oh! How could I have put
that timer on upside down?
I swear I followed
the manual precisely.
I'm a dried-up husk of a scientist.
This is all my fault.
No, it's my fault too.
I'm sure I threw out
more than my share of trash.
And when my toilet broke, I just
went straight in the garbage can.
Leela's right. The people of the
20th century were idiotic slobs.
-Especially me.
-Enough! You failed miserably.
Time to put a real scientist
in charge.
-Wernstrom!
-The very same.
-Wernstrom, can you save my city?
-Yes, but it'll cost you.
-First, I need tenure.
-Done.
-A research grant.
-You got it.
Lab access and five grad students,
at least three Chinese.
Done. What's your plan?
What plan? I'm set for life.
Au revoir, suckers.
-That rat! Do something!
-I would, but he's got tenure.
[PEOPLE GAG]
It's time to take action.
Stephanie, cancel the maid.
Have her come tomorrow.
Well, I'm out of ideas.
Anyone?
Wait!
If we could build an object of the
same size, density and consistency. . .
. . .it might knock the ball away
without smashing it to bits.
Where can we find a substance the
same density and consistency?
Alas, I don't know.
What about garbage?
Good Lord! A second ball of garbage!
That just might work!
You can't just find garbage
in the streets.
City's been garbage-free
for 500 years!
-Then it's time to make some more.
-Make garbage?
-But how?
-Stand back and watch the master.
This Slurm can?
Now it's garbage.
These papers?
Garbage.
This picture of your wife?
Pure garbage. Now you try it.
By God, I think the boy's
got something!
Come on, the fate of the city
is at stake!
Good.
Don't finish that. Throw it away.
Drink that beer and drop the bottle.
Very nice.
Get that robot some more beer!
Trashing this room's a start.
Let's get Fry's message to the people!
People of New New York,
take a lesson from the 20th century.
Stop this recycling and throw
your garbage on the floor.
Go on, chuck it anywhere like I did.
Your city is counting on you.
If my calculations are correct,
this ball will knock the other. . .
. . .directly into the sun!
If mine are correct,
we're all going to die horribly!
Places, everyone! Prepare for launch!
Five, four, three, two. . .
. . .three, four, five, six. . . .
Just fire the damn thing.
FRY:
Oops.
[HEART BEATING FAST]
[HEART BEATS ONCE]
[FAST DRUM BEAT]
[SNIFFS]
-Burning garbage!
-It worked!
And so, on behalf of the entire city,
I thank you, Professor Farnsworth.
I present you with the Academy prize,
which we confiscated. . .
. . .from Wernstrom after
we realized he was a jackass.
In your face, Wernstrom!
I'll get you, Farnsworth, even
if it takes another 1 00 years!
And Fry, we owe you
a tremendous debt as well.
Without your garbage-making skills. . .
. . .we'd all be buried under
20th-century garbage.
Should we be celebrating?
What if it returns to Earth
like the first one?
Who cares? That would take centuries.
Exactly. It's none of our concern.
That's the 20th-century spirit!
[CROWD CHEERS]
Hell is Other Robots
This is awesome!
I've waited 1 000 years
for this show.
-Can I get anybody a beer?
-Sure!

You stick around
I'll make it worth your while
I've got numbers beyond

Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
Style, profile, I said
It always brings me back
When I hear "Ooh Child"
Impressive. They're busting

That qualifies as ill,
from a technical standpoint.

Peace! We out!
[CROWD CHEERS]
-Hey, Bender!
-Hey, Fender!
I haven't seen you
since high school!
-Still work at Jack in the Box?
-No. . .
. . .I'm with the band.
Oh, oh yeah.
Fellas, meet my friends,
Bender, Fry and Leela.
We're not that interested
in meeting them.
Wow! I love you guys!
In my century,
I had all five albums.
That was 1 000 years ago.
Now we got seven.
Can I borrow the new ones
and some blank tapes?
Let's ditch these organ sacks
and hit the real party.
Count me in.
I'm gonna drink until I reboot!
[ROBOTS MOAN]
What kind of party is this?
No booze and only one hooker.
Don't be a drag, man.
We're jacking-on.
Oh. . .yeah!
-Want a jolt?
-I'm no square. . .
. . .but it's counter-indicated
by my manual.
[ROBOTS LAUGH]
"Counter-indicated. "
Come on, grab a jack.
I told them you were cool.
If jacking-on makes strangers
think I'm cool. . .
. . .I'll do it!

Easy, baby.
Don't want to get hooked.
Don't worry. I don't have
an addictive personality.
What are we doing
in this bad neighborhood?
Shut up, square!
I'll just be a minute.
Wretched sinner unit,
the path to robot heaven lies here. . .
. . .in the Good Book, 3.0.
Do I preach to you when you're
lying stoned in the gutter?
No! So beat it!
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Who was that?
Your mama. Now shut up
and drag me to work!
[BENDER MOANS]
Our electric bill's up
like a snake up sugarcane.
Someone here's been wasting
a whole heap of juice.
-Probably you!
-Me?
-Good morning, Bender.
-None of your business! Lay off!
-What's his problem?
-Looks like he's abusing electricity.
Bender? No way.
[ELECTRIC SURGE]
I would've noticed.
Why are you spending so much
time in the bathroom?
-Are you jacking-on?
BENDER: No! Don't come in!
Good news, everyone!
Today you'll deliver subpoenas. . .
. . .to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet.
All right! Let's get to work!
I'll be out in a second!
Vinny said he was giving me
the kiss of death. . .
-. . .but I think he was gay.
-Did he use his tongue?
A little.
[MUMBLES]
-You okay?
-None of your business! Lay off me!
Uh-oh. There's an electrical
disturbance ahead.
-What kind of disturbance?
-Electrical.
It will take some
careful piloting to avoid it.
[LAUGHS]
We're heading into
the electric field!
FRY:
What's happening? I feel weird!
Come on, universe!
You big, mostly empty wuss!
Give me all the juice you got!
[STAMMERS]
Oh, mama.
[CRASHES]
What?
We didn't mind your drinking,
your kleptomania. . .
-. . .or the pornography.
-That's why we loved you.
But this abuse crossed the line.
You almost killed us.
FRY:
You betrayed my trust.
Like when my friend
swore he wasn't on drugs. . .
. . .then sold me my mom's VCR.
Later I found out he was taking drugs.
I'm ashamed to be your friend.
You're right. I'm a lost cause.
[ELECTRIC BUZZING]
[ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS]
Maybe there's another way.
BENDER:
Oh, yeah! That's the good stuff.
What am I doing?
What have I become?
I see a lot of fancy robots
here today. . .
. . .made of real shiny metal. But
that don't impress the Robot Devil!
-No, sir!
-If you're a sinner. . .
. . .he'll plug his infernal modem
in the wall. . .
. . .belching smoke and flame!
He'll download you
straight to Robot Hell!
-Straight to hell!
-Who will stand up and be saved?
Who? Who?
Me.
As another cost-cutting measure,
no more salt-water cooler.
This is a witch hunt!
BENDER:
Oh, what a beautiful morning
Oh, what a beautiful day
Greetings, friends!
Don't we look nice today?
He's whacked out on electricity again.
I'm whacked out on life!
My friends, I found religion.
Religion? ls this another scam
to get free yarmulkes?
Give him a break.
If this helps Bender,
then we should be supportive.
-Yeah.
-Oh, yes.
Wonderful!
Then you'll all come to my long. . .

-Uh. . . .
-Oh, l, um. . . . .
We are gathered
to deliver Brother Bender. . .
. . .from the cold steel grip
of the Devil. . .
. . .unto the cold steel bosom
of our congregation.
-Tell it, preacher!
-That equals true.
Brother Bender, do you accept
the principles of Robotology. . .
. . .on pain of damnation
in Robot Hell?
-Yes, I do!
-Then I will now baptize you.
Press any key to continue.
[ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS]
While you're at it,
could you touch up this seam?
Unbelievable. The old Bender
would never buy us dinner.
Old Bender's gone.
He won't trouble you anymore.
Would monsieur
care to see the wine list?
No poison for us, thanks.
I'll stick with good old mineral oil.
Functional.
I'm hungrier than a snake
in a cane field.
Friends! Friends!
Surely you're not going to eat
before we say Robot Grace?
In the name of all
that is logical, we give thanks. . .
. . .for the energy
we are about to absorb.

Amen.
-Does that mean we can eat now?
-Yes.
But first, since I love you all
so much. . .
. . .I'd like to give everyone hugs.
-Come here, Fry!
-I don't want to.
Fry, you're my friend.
Everyone line up for a hug!
Let's tear down some emotional walls.
-What are you doing to my ship?
-Sanctifying it.
There. That ought to convert
a few tailgaters.
-His dumb religion's driving me nuts.
-Amen.
He should've joined a mainstream
religion, like Oprah-ism or voodoo.
-We've got to get old Bender back.
-I know how.
We have to reacquaint him
with a little thing called "sleaze. "
Somebody hired an interstellar
spaceship to deliver a package. . .
. . .to Atlantic City?
What are we delivering?
This.
Where to?
Here.
Another job well done.
Back to the office for an evening
of fasting and repentance.
Wait! As long as we're here,
why not see some exotic dancing?
Hey, great idea!
But those girls don't wear cases!
-You can see their bare circuits!
-Come on, it'll be fun.
We could even drink
some fortified wine.
What? Drinking wine is a sin.
Even if it is delicious.
Look at that woman's purse.
It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.
-Thou shalt not snatch!
-There's Hooker-Bot 5000.
She's got a heart of gold.
-Hey, sailing unit.
-Stop tempting me!
For once in my life,
I have inner peace!
That's for losers!
Come on, sin your heart out!
-Go nuts!
-Live a little.
Could you hold my purse?
Go for it, Bender.
You know you want to.
Well. . . .
[BENDER LAUGHS]
I'm the greatest!
-We got the old Bender back.
-You know it, pork pie!
Except for one thing.

Greetings, Bender!
Welcome to Robot Hell!
[SCREAMS]
-What happened to Bender?
-He didn't check out.
The ashtray's here.
[YELPS]
Nibbler's caught the scent
of vodka and oil!
Go, boy! Follow that stench!
I'm hallucinating, right?
No, Bender! Robot Hell is quite real.
Here's our brochure.
I don't belong here.
I don't like scary and painful things.
Sorry. You agreed to this
when you joined our religion.
If you sin, you go to Robot Hell. . .
. . .for all eternity!
Aw, hell--
I mean, heck.
You can say that here.
I remember this place.
They closed it after people
caught salmonella.
Look! It's the symbol
of Bender's old religion.
Unbelievable!
It's an actual, factual
Robot Hell!
Who would've thought Hell would
exist and be in New Jersey?
Actually--
Whoa!
We know all your sins. . .
. . .and prepared an agonizing
and ironic punishment for each one.
Gentlemen?
Oh, crap. Singing.
Mind if I smoke?
Cigars are evil
You won 't miss them
We'll find ways to simulate
That smell
What a sorry fella
Rolled up in smoke like a panatela
Here on Level 1 of Robot Hell

So is forging phony IOUs

What type of torture's justified

Deep-fried robot!
-Just tell me why
-Read this 55-page warrant
-There must be robots worse than I
-There really aren 't
Please let me explain
My crimes were merely boyish pranks
-You stole from nuns and banks
-Blame my upbringing
Please stop sinning while I'm singing
Selling bootleg tapes is wrong
Musicians need that income to survive
Bender gonna make noise
With your hard drive scratched
By the Beastie Boys
That's what you what you
What you get on Level 5
-I don 't feel well
-It's up to us to rescue him
-Maybe he likes it here in Hell
-It's us who tempted him to sin
-Maybe he's back at the motel
-Fry, don 't be scared
I'm sure we'll be spared
-Just sit back, enjoy the ride
-My ass has blisters from the slide
Fencing diamonds, cockfights
Publishing indecent magazines
You'll pay for every crime
Knee-deep in electric slime
Suffering to the end of time
Enduring tortures which rhyme
Trapped forever here in Robot Hell
Of course, that's just for starters.
-Bender, are you all right?
-No.
They're tormenting me with
up-tempo singing and dancing.
All right, Beelzebot.
How can we get our friend back?
Sorry, I hold the cards.
There's nothing you can do.
Now, if you'll sign this
fiddle contest waiver.
Wait. What fiddle contest?
The Fairness in Hell Act of 2275. . .
. . .requires me to inform you that
if you win a fiddle contest. . .
. . .you win back Bender's soul.
-As well as a solid gold fiddle.
-Wouldn't it weigh 1 000 pounds. . .
-. . .and sound crummy?
-It's mostly for show.
-Do you know how to play?
-No. Do you?
No. But I played drums.
They're similar.
-What happens if we lose?
-You'll win a small, silver fiddle.
Also, I guess I'll kill one of you.
Him.
-We'll do it.
-Very well, then.
Beat this!
[PLAYS FIDDLE]
Well, we're boned.
Your turn.

[HALLELUJAH CHORUS PLAYS]
-Hurry, Bender!
-I could. . .
. . .if you'd drop
the stupid gold violin.
Oh. Sorry.
-Yeah!
-All right!
Don't worry. I'll never be
too good or too evil again.
From now on, I'll just be me.
Do you think you could be
a little less evil than that?
I don't know. You think you
could survive a 700-foot fall?
Good old Bender.
Yeah, yeah, this one goes out
To my man Bender
Sending this out, special dedication
To all my people in robot homeworld
We got the professor
My man Dr. Zoidberg
I'd like to shout out
A personal shout-out to Leela
Right
My man Bender
Nibbler, Nibbler in the house
Big shout out to all the Futurama
That was the worst delivery ever.
Never go to a planet
called "Cannibalon. "
That's right. Food was good, though.
-Great news, everyone--
-Shove it! We quit!
Then I'll have to hire a new crew
to go on our company vacation.
-Vacation?
-All right!
Great! I haven't had time off
since I was 21 through 24.
It's my way of thanking you for not
reporting my countless violations. . .
-. . .of safety and minimum-wage laws.
-Aw, you!
I've booked us on the
maiden voyage of the largest. . .
. . .most luxurious space cruise ship
ever built. The Titanic!
Looks nice.
A Flight to Remember
Hey, where's my suitcase?
As mayor of New New York,
it's my pleasure to introduce. . .
. . .the honorary captain
for the Titanic's maiden voyage.
A man who single-handedly defeated
the Retiree People. . .
. . .of the Assisted Living Nebula:
Zapp Brannigan!
God, not Zapp Brannigan!
-You know Zapp Brannigan?
-Let's just say we've crossed paths.
Before or after you slept with him?
She's a beautiful ship.
Shapely, seductive.
I'm gonna fly her brains out.
And now, without further adieu. . .
. . .I christen this ship Titanic.
DICAPRIO:
Ooh!
[CROWD CHEERS]
Well, well, well! The Lady Leela.
Take notes, Kif.
You're about to witness
the subtle waltz known as seduction.
So! Trapped on a ship with me.
What say you and I knock
some very sensual boots?
It's tempting,
but I have a fiancé now.
Him! Fry, darling,
meet Zapp Brannigan.
Huh? Ooh!
How do you do?
Ah, here's my stateroom.
[PURRS]
Where is it? Come on!
Oh!
Hermes, you and Labarbara
have the suite through there.
Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank
is on the other side.
First class seems nice.
It'll seem even nicer
once you've seen your room.
We're on the Fiesta Deck.
This is it.
At least we get a window.
I'm tired of this room
and everyone in it.
Excuse me. I'm gonna pop over
to the casino for the next 1 35 hours.
I think I'll go fill up on bisque
at the buffet.
That just leaves you
and your fake fiancé. . .
. . .all alone on a romantic cruise.
-Take it off or I'll break it off.
-Okay!
Captain's inspection.
Mm-hm.
[LAUGHS]
I'm betting it all!
Come on! Baby needs
a new pair of feet!
Snake eyes.
My cheating unit malfunctioned!
You gotta give me a do-over.
Sorry, the house limit is
three do-overs. Next shooter.
Give me your biggest, strongest,
cheapest drink.
You got it.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Bender.
Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca.
I was surprised to see another robot
in first class. Most are laborers.
I assure you, I barely know
the meaning of the word "Iabor. "
-Oh, Mr. Bender.
-Please, call me Bender.
Oh, well, goodness. I don't. . . .
-Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.
-I'll get the powder.
The itch for adventure.
Let's change course.
It's a leisure cruise.
Our path was set by the travel agency.
That's for schoolgirls.
Here's a route with chest hair.
Directly through a swarm of comets?
Yes, comets. The icebergs of the sky.
By jackknifing across
at breakneck speed. . .
. . .we might just get some kind
of gravity boost or something.
It's time to shove a jalapeno
up this ship's tailpipe.
Divert power from the shields.
Full speed ahead.
Oh, yeah--
-Amy! Hello!
-Mom, Dad?! What are you doing here?
We were enjoying a relaxing vacation.
Since you're here, we must meddle.
-We met a nice boy in the next cabin.
-He's not very ugly.
You should marry him. Or use him
to conceive a grandchild for us.
There he is at the buffet.
He seems really nice,
but I already have a boyfriend.
Where is he?
And why isn't he here right now,
fathering our grandchild?
Our accommodations aren't great.
But it sure is beautiful here.
It's romantic-- I mean, platonic.
That sure is one platonic view.
Fry, just be quiet.
I'm beginning to think this whole
fake fiancé thing was a terrible--
FRY:
Hm? Mmm.
Perhaps this is an awkward time.
If it doesn't work out
with this pipsqueak. . .
. . .I want you to know I'll be there
to score you on the rebound.
[ZAPP HUMS]
Look, before you get any crazy ideas,
that was for Zapp.
-Well, you got anything else for him?
-Can we try not to complicate this?
Mom, Dad, I'd like you
to meet Fry, my boyfriend.
FRY:
Hm? Mmm.
FRY:
See you later, wuvums.
It would have been nice to know
you're dating Amy.
I'm not. It's to fool her parents.
-Hey, you're not jealous, are you?
-What? No, of course not.
I consider my fake relationship
with you more meaningful.
Mind if I freshen up before we go out?
I was just about to suggest
the same thing.
Mmm.
[LAUGHS]
Pay dirt!
COUNTESS:
Lovely, isn't it?
Yeah. But only 93 percent
as lovely as you.
Either that was a computing error or
you're the most romantic robot ever.
I don't get it, iZac.
The bracelet had a diamond
the size of a raccoon's brain.
-Why couldn't I steal it?
-It's obvious. You're in love.
It's true.
But we're star-crossed robots!
She, a countess built
with a silver spoon in her mouth. . .
. . .and me, just a regular honest Joe.
-You gonna pay for those?
-Hell, no.

Fellas, please! I'm in love.

[POUNDING]
[BENDER GROANS]
What are you doing?
This penniless chump
was stealing drinks.
I see. Here you are, sir.
Keep the change.
You got it!
-Go, professor!
-Lean back more.
Ow!
You could out-limbo
all of these people!
Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know
I can't. Not after what happened.
ANNOUNCER: Now limboing for the Earth
team, Hermes Conrad.
You're my hero, Hermes!
I'm gonna be just like you!
No, boy, stop! It's too low!
Your backbone can't take it!
I'm just like Hermes!
I'm just like--
[BOY'S SPINE CRACKS]
No!
You don't have to limbo
if you don't want.
It doesn't make you any less of a man.
-Though it did get me some action.
-I like a man who's flexible.
Attention!
As captain of this ship. . .
. . .the burden of naming the limbo
winner is mine, and mine alone.
Shouldn't you be steering?
And the winner is. . . .
Leela!
But I didn't limbo.
No matter. I know from personal
experience how horizontal you can get.
As a reward, you and that hair-pile. . .
. . .are invited to dine
at the captain's table tonight.
Whoo!
Well, now you know.
I'm not actually rich.
I'm a fraud.
A poor, lazy, sexy fraud.
This isn't even a real bow tie.
It's magnetic.
I don't care if you have money.
I love your artificial intelligence
and sincerity simulator.
You do? Really?
[MAKES PRINTER NOISES]
[GIGGLING]
I like your style, Fry.
You remind me of a young me.
Not much younger.
Perhaps even a couple years older.
-Thank you.
-As a gentleman, I warn you:
If you even glance
at another woman. . .
. . .I'll be all over Leela like a fly
on a pile of very seductive manure.
-Leela's the only girl for me.
-Hey, Fry.
-Amy!
-Leela!
The family Wong.
Our party is complete.
What'll we do? He can't pretend
to be both our boyfriends.
I learned how to handle
delicate situations. . .
. . .from a show called Three's Company.
I'd like to toast the happy couple.
Down the hatch.
-Hear, hear! Now, let's have a kiss!
-Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.
Let me think.
Come and knock on our door
Mr. Roper. . . .
-What's the holdup? Kiss Amy!
-I'm confused.
Tell me, which one of these ladies
are you involved with?
[HUMS THEME TO THREE'S COMPANY]
-May I have a word with you?
-No!
-It's an emergency, sir.
-Come back when it's a catastrophe.
Oh, very well.
Well, with Zapp gone
and my parents still here. . .
. . .I suggest Fry give me
a nice, convincing kiss.
Now there's something
we can all enjoy.
-Sir, remember your course correction?
-No.
It's proving more suicidal
than we'd hoped.
I don't know which disgusts me more,
your cowardice or stupidity.
We'll set a new course
for that region. . .
. . .near that black-ish hole-ish thing.
-Why'd you run off from dinner?
-I didn't run off.
I had time to finish eating
while you were kissing Amy.
I'm not interested in her,
if that's bothering you.
Are you sure? I mean,
she has two eyes. You have two eyes.
We seem like a perfect match.
But I don't feel that way about her.
LEELA: Nice nebula.
FRY: Yeah.
Looks like everybody's got somebody.
Except me.
And me.
What was that?
My God! We're heading
into a black hole!
FRY:
Talk about a mood killer.
Don't blame yourself.
We were doomed from the start.
Now the captain must go down
with the ship.
-That's surprisingly noble of you.
-No, it's noble of you.
As of now, you're in command.
Congratulations, captain.
Okay. We just have to get from here
to the escape pods.
-I'm too young to die!
-Come on, before it's too late!
You all go!
I'm gonna take one last look around.
You know, for stuff to steal.
-You're going back for the countess.
-Yes, I am.
Don't tell the others.
If I don't return,
say I died robbing some old man.
I'll say you died prying
the ring off his dead finger.
I love you, buddy!
Countess! Countess!
COUNTESS:
Bender!
-I fell through the deck!
-Are you hurt, my sweet?
-No, luckily a family broke my fall.
-Just hang on!
I'll take care of that fire!
You risked your life to save me!
And I'd do it again!
And perhaps a third time!
But that would be it.
When we kiss, I feel like
I'm standing waist-deep. . .
. . .in a pool of cold, rising water.
[SCREAMING]
Hurry! The escape pods
should be just ahead.
HERMES:
Faster!
[GROANS]
It won't move.
The door release is on the other side.
No one could squeeze under there.
No one, except a legendary
limbo champion!
Oh, Hermes!
It's been a while.
This one is for that little kid
limboing in heaven now.
That's my man! All right, limbo.
I still got the moves!
Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.
-Just go hit the release, you hot dog.
-Yes, dear.
-That's my man.
-Yay, Hermes!
HERMES:
Can somebody help me up?
[SCREAMING]
-Now what do we do?
-Wait a second.
-Aren't you in the yacht club?
-You're right!
I'm a class-three yacht!
[SCREAMING]
Thank God there are plenty
of escape pods.
We needn't dress up
like women and children.
We can't leave yet.
We gotta wait for Bender.
The high gravity
must slow down his looting.
-Mom! Dad! You're alive!
-Yeah, but so what?
-More importantly, we found you a man.
-A captain.
Mom, I don't--
-Hi.
-Hello.
I don't feel well.
Look, it's our nebula.
When I see it, I'll think back
to that moment when we almost--
Never mind.
Everyone else is off the ship.
Where is Bender?
I don't know.
But we can't wait any longer.
Goodbye, Bender.
Wait for us!
Something's wrong.
We're two tons overweight.
-Well, it's not me.
-Look!
I'm slipping! The pull is too strong!
I can't live without you!
If you let go, I let go.
No, you have too much to live for.
It may hurt for a while,
but you'll share your love again.
After all, it's shareware.
Don't talk like that. Tragic romances
always have a happy ending.
Farewell!
No.
She's gone.
But she saved all our lives. Without
her, we're light enough to get away.
Don't cry. Nobody knows
what happens in a black hole.
It's possible she's alive
in another dimension, right?
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
Not a chance.
At least I'll always
have her bracelet.
What do you think it's worth?
It's fake, man.
[BENDER GROANS]
Good news. We've got a very
special delivery today.
-Who's it for?
-Me.
Another job well done.
No. I need it shipped to my office
at Mars University.
It's an experiment that may
win me the Nobel Prize.
-What field?
-I don't care. The pay's the same.
-Is it dangerous?
-Oh, my, no.
[GRUNTING FROM INSIDE OF BOX]
[THUDS]
Off we go!
Mars University
Impressive. In the 20th century. . .
. . .we had no idea Mars
had a university.
In those days, Mars was just a
dreary, uninhabitable wasteland.
Much like Utah. But unlike Utah,
it was eventually made livable. . .
. . .when the university was founded
in 2636.
They planted traditional college
foliage: ivy, trees, hemp.
Soon the planet was terraformed.
-Is it safe to breathe the air?
-Of course.
Over here is Wong Library.
It has the largest collection of
literature in the western universe.
There's a chapter of my old
robot fraternity. . .
. . .Epsilon Rho Rho.
You went to college?
Of course. I went to bending college.
Majored in Bending.
-What was your minor?
-Robo-American Studies.
Are you the moose-head fumigator?
No. Actually, I'm an Epsilon
from way back.
-Close enough. Come on in.
-Thanks! Here's your finger back.
The coolest robots are in
this fraternity.
Mate in 1 43 moves.
Oh, pooh! You win again!
Uh-oh! Nerds!
I'm Gearshift, chapter president.
This is Oily, and this here
is Fat-Bot.
You're losers. My name's Bender.
Bender from Bending State? Wow!
You're a legend around here!
One night you drank a keg,
streaked across campus. . .
. . .and crammed 58 humans
into a phone booth.
Yeah, well, a lot of them were
children. Anyway, I should get going.
Wait, we're the lamest frat on campus.
Even Hillel has better parties.
Stay and teach us how to be cool.
Okay, but I'll need ten kegs of beer,
a continuous "Louie, Louie" tape. . .
. . .and a regulation two-story
panty-raid ladder.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
I tell you, being here really takes
me back to my college days.
Step right up!
Who wants to learn physics?
Keep your hands inside the car
at all times.
Good old Coney lsland College.
Go Whitefish!
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you don't seem educated.
Oh yeah?
Read it and weep.
I'm a certified college dropout.
Everyone knows 20th-century colleges
were really expensive daycare centers.
True. By current academic standards,
you're a mere high-school dropout.
What?! That's not fair.
I deserve the same respect
other college dropouts get.
By God, I'll enroll at Mars University
and drop out all over again!
-You won't last two weeks.
-Thanks for believing in me.
Classmate! What you taking?
I don't know. What are you teaching?
Same thing I teach every semester:
math of quantum neutrino fields.
I made it up so no student
would dare take it.
Math of wonton burrito meals.
I'll be there!
Please, I don't know how to
teach. I'm a professor.
See you in class!
Oh!
[GIGGLING]
This is gonna be great.
BENDER: Bingo!
-Oh, mama!
Oh, yeah. Someone's been
a bad computer.
BENDER:
Get a load of that!
I say! You've damaged our servants'
quarters. And our servants!
This time, Robot House
has gone too far!
Cheese it!
Pretty nice for a single. Two desks,
two chairs, a couple of beds.
[KNOCKING]
-A woodpecker?
-Probably your roommate.
Oh, right. Cool.
Come on in, roomie!
-What the--?
-I call top bunk!
[THE MONKEY HUMS]
My roommate's a monkey?
Brilliant deduction!
You're a credit to your species.
-I see you've met Guenter.
-You know each other?
He's my experiment, the top-secret
contents of this stinking crate.
I'd rather live in a crate than
share a room with this dork.
-What makes him talk?
-Is he genetically engineered?
Oh, please, that's preposterous
science-fiction mumbo-jumbo.
Guenter's intelligence lies
in his electronium hat.
It harnesses sunspot power
to produce cognitive radiation.
You're wasting your breath.
He didn't understand a word.
I understood the word "hat. "
Stop! I arranged that you'd be
roommates for a reason:
I'll only have to remember one phone
number. Shake hands. Make up.
You want a banana?
I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-
flavored energy bars made from tofu.
I don't like you.
This is gonna be a cakewalk.
Welcome to 20th century history.
Look to your left, then to your right,
then in nine other directions.
One of the 1 2 of you
won't pass this class.
Boring. Let's hear about
Walter Mondale already.
Be forewarned:
The only way to get an A in my class
is to have lived in the 20th century.
Swish!
[ELECTRICITY BUZZES]
You were saying, Mr. Fry?
I'm from the 20th century.
Ask me anything.
What device invented in
the 20th century. . .
. . .allowed people to view broadcast
programs in their own homes?
I know this.
What do you call it? Lite Brite!
I believe the answer
is "television. "
Very good, Mr. Guenter.
Wow. Smart and cute.
What I love about being dean. . .
. . .is the peace and quiet
and the respect I receive.
[PHONE RINGS]
What's this about?
RECEPTIONIST:
The Robot House students are here.
Robot House.
-Hey, dean, nice-looking model.
-You keep away from it!
You robots are a disgrace
to this university.
Whenever a fire alarm is pulled,
it's Robot House.
When the campus liquor store's
looted, Robot House.
-When a human corpse is desecrated--
-I can explain that.
That's enough out of you!
From this day forth, Robot House is
on dodecatupple-secret probation!
-No fair!
-My mom is gonna kill me!
I have to get back to the one thing. . .
. . .that's kept me sane these past
eight years: my model ship.
Fat-Bot! No!
When I get nervous, I get hungry.
Cheese it!
DEAN:
Robot House!
Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off.
If you're free, might I
escort you to a kegger?
Not even if you were
the last man on Mars.
Hey! You like bananas?
I got her number!
How do you like them bananas?
Therefore, by process
of elimination. . .
. . .the electron must taste like
grapeade.
-Sorry. I overslept.
-Until 5 p.m.?
That monkey kept me up all night
with his constant thinking.
Thinking and thinking, trying
to make me look idiotic.
Don't be jealous.
Without his hat, he might be no
more intelligent than you.
-I hate that rodent!
-He's my most important experiment.
If you don't stop fighting,
I'll have you both neutered.
That'll show him.
I'd like you to meet my parents,
Leo and lnes.
I'm so glad we could admit Amy. . .
. . .in exchange for
your generous contribution.
-How much more for Phi Beta Kappa?
-How much you got?
Sorry I'm late. I was off at a
study session with Chrissy.
I'm glad you made it, because
in honor of Parents' Weekend. . .
. . .I have a special surprise for you.
Mom! Dad! What are you doing here?
This is so humiliating!
Now these monkeys I like!
What's that? You want to come out?
No! Stop!
I say.
-What's that they're flinging at us?
-Dear Lord! All over the dean!
Why don't join your parents on the
chandelier? I'll take a picture!
Oh!
The party's winding down.
Let's take a road trip to Tijuana
and get Fat-Bot some action!
It's my first time.
I'm really nervous.
Robot House!
You were cruel. It may sound like
an after-school special. . .
. . .but we learned who the real
animal was today.
Peer pressure?
Look out! He's got a gun!
Leave me alone.
What's going on?
I thought you don't like bananas.
Of course I do.
I try so hard to fit in. . .
. . .but seeing my parents
act like that. . .
. . .made me realize I'm just
a primitive beast.
Not everyone turns out
like their parents.
Look at me. My folks were honest,
hardworking people.
Besides, you're not like other
monkeys. You've got the hat.
So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool,
and it makes me smart.
But it doesn't make me happy.
That's so sad. I didn't even know
monkeys could cry.
They can't. It's all the hat!
If you're so miserable, maybe you
should go back to the jungle.
The jungle.
I couldn't do that to the professor.
I'm his prize experiment.
He's like a father.
He's not your father. That guy in
the punch bowl was your father.
Look at him. I'm so proud.
FRY: Thanks, professor.
-Not you.
[SHOCKS FRY]
[JUNGLE MUSIC PLAYS]
Oh, I always feared he might
run off like this.
Why? Why?
Why didn't I break his legs?
Oh, poor Guenter.
So he just ran away in
the middle of the exam?
I'm afraid so.
All he handed in was a paper smeared
with feces. He tied with Fry.
I told him to go back to the jungle.
You what? After I spent months
slaving over a hot monkey brain?
You tried to force Guenter to be
a human, but he's an animal.
He belongs in the wild, or the
circus on a tiny tricycle.
Now that's entertainment.
But Guenter's better off being
intelligent. Tell him, Leela.
I'm staying out of this.
Now here's my opinion.
What we should do is. . . .
-What?
-We'll go to the jungle. . .
. . .and let Guenter decide.
What?
You all know the rules. The winning
house becomes Greek Council head.
Should that house currently be on any
type of multiple secret probation. . .
. . .it'll be lifted.
And I'll be forced to serve as Grand
Marshal of a parade honoring them.
I say, Robot House.
Your watercraft's as ill-designed
as you yourselves.
Good one, Chet.
Oh, yeah? Watch this!
Well, I never!
Fraternities, on your marks.
Hey!
The jungles on Mars look like
the jungles on earth.
Jungles on earth?
I see some movement.
I think it's him.
Stand back!
-Oops.
-Don't worry.
They'll be fine once the tranquilizer
wears off.
There's our man.
Professor, offer Guenter the hat.
Fry, offer him the banana.
He'll choose if he wants to be
intelligent or a mindless animal.
-Guenter, take the hat.
-No, the banana! The banana!
The philosophical and metaphysical
ramifications--
Banana! Banana!
What's that sound?
[MUSIC PLAYS]
-You sure this is a shortcut?
-Not as sure as I was an hour ago.
[SCREAMING]
[SCREAMING]
And the winner is. . .
. . .Robot House?!
Thank God this log is sturdy.
Put on the hat!
You're the only one who can save us!
Stupid monkey.
-Not there!
-Keep trying!
Eureka! The hat goes on the head!
It's all so obvious now!
Help us, Guenter!
My goodness! Hang on!
I need to do some calculations!
Got it!
Grab on!
-We're saved!
-Appreciate it, Guenter!
Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter! Climb up the
vine! You can still save yourself.
Why bother?
I've got nothing to live for.
I was miserable as a genius.
As a monkey, I was so dumb
I tried to wear a hat on my butt.
There's just no place for me
in this world.
Although, on the other hand. . . .
[SCREAMS]
Oh, that poor, sweet monkey.
Let's go gather him up. No sense
letting him go to waste.
-Guenter, you're alive!
-I guess the hat broke my fall.
It's working at half capacity.
But I can fix it.
No, wait! I like it like this!
I actually feel sort of. . .
. . .happy.
But what about your
super-intelligence?
With that, there was
too much pressure.
I want to be a moderately intelligent
monkey who wears a suit.
So I'm transferring
to business school!
No!
Come on, everyone!
Keg party in Robot House!

number was four.

to rain destruction upon Earth.

clear. It's time to knuckle under.

sooner perish...

...fresh from his bloody triumph over
the Gandhi Nebula pacifists...
...25-star general, Zapp Brannigan.
Look, it's that idiotic windbag
you slept with.
The Earth's under attack.
Can't we forget about that?
Evidently not.
If there's an alien
out there I can 't kill...
...l haven 't killed him yet.
I can 't go it alone.
I order every available
ship to report for duty.
If you have no ship, secure a weapon.
Fire wildly in the air.
You heard the windbag: we're drafted.
Everyone into the ship.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on.
I won't fight.
I'm a conscientious objector.
-A what?
-You know. A coward.
As it's an emergency...

Some are white, some are black.

. . .alien death cannons,
clogging them with wreckage.
Wouldn't it make more sense
to send the robots in first--?
Sir! I volunteer for a suicide
mission. Aw, cut it out!
When I'm in command, son, every
mission's a suicide mission.
Which reminds me. Perhaps
before we head into battle. . .
. . .you'd like to make love, in case
one of us doesn't come back?
We should wait till after,
in case neither of us comes back.
Here's hoping.
I'll be a science-fiction hero, like
Uhura or Captain Janeway or Xena.
This isn 't TV, it's real life.
Can 't you tell the difference?
Sure. I just like TV better.
[MIMICS SOUND OF GUNFIRE]
Damage report!
The auxiliary power's out
and they spilled my cocktail.
All right, scum wads.
This one's for Bender's cocktail.
We did it! We won!
Yeah, but it'll never bring back
my martini.
Well, who wants a martini?
Good work, everyone.
The mother ship is destroyed.
-What is that?
-It appears to be the mother ship.
-Then what did we just blow up?
-The Hubble Telescope.
Stop exploding, you cowards!
It's hopeless.
If we'll be blown to bits, we'll do it
it in the comfort of our home.
You're the captain.
You're the delivery boy.
And you'll be the alcoholic,
foul-mouthed--
God, you're alive!
I mean, thank God you're alive!
Sorry. Check back in three days.
A week at the most.
We want McNeal! Stop stalling!
Now, a rebuttal from President McNeal.
The people of Earth remain united in
my refusal to hand over myself.
Total annihilation is a small price
to pay compared with--
Here he is! Come and get him.
-You are not McNeal!
-Huh?
-You are not the one we want.
-Thank you, glorious masters. I--
-Give us McNeal!
-That was McNeal.
No, McNeal.
The Single Female Lawyer.
-She's promiscuous. Wears miniskirts.
-Really?
Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
McNeal, an unmarried human female. . .
. . .struggling to succeed
in a human male's world.
Maybe that's her excuse
for incompetence.
Silence! We will accept no more
decoys. This is the McNeal.
-Wait, I know her.
-You do not, you big fat liar.
You don't know anyone.
All you do is watch TV.
That's where I know her from.
Jenny McNeal.
She was a character on a 20th-century
TV show, Single Female Lawyer.
If they hope to see a TV show that
hasn't existed for 1 000 years. . .
. . .they're royally boned.
We'll raise your planet's temperature
by one million degrees a day...
...for five days unless we see McNeal
at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow.
8:00 Central.
I'm beginning to think there'll be
no forced mating at all.
They'll destroy the Earth. . .
. . .if they don't see a TV show
about some bimbo lawyer?
How could they know about
a show from 1 000 years ago?
Omicron Persei Eight's about
1 000 light years away.
The electromagnetic waves would
have just gotten there.
-You see--
-Magic. Got it.
Back in 1 999, Single Female Lawyer's
season finale. . .
. . .was interrupted by
technical problems.
Some idiot spilled Coke
on the transmitter.
Beer. I would think.
They want to see that episode.
Let's find the tape.
No copies are left.
Most videotapes from that era
were damaged in 2443. . .
. . .during the second coming of Jesus.
I saw the first 30 seconds
of that episode.
I could make up an ending
we'd act out.
I could make the costumes.
I have an old five-megawatt
broadcasting tower.
And I could be an acting coach!
Let's put on a show!
Leela, you'll star as Jenny--
Uh-uh. Forget it. A: I'm camera shy.
B: I get tongue-tied in front of an
audience armed with death rays.
Plus, you don't have the thighs
for a miniskirt.
Give me the script.
Places everyone!
Okay. . . .
All set.
Lights!
Camera one!
Camera two!
Camera three!
[CAMERA THREE BUZZES]
Prepare the water cooler. . .
. . .that we may gather around it later
to discuss things.
BENDER:
Single Female Lawyer
Fighting for her client
Wearing sexy miniskirts
And being self-reliant
I'm pretty good.
McNeal, you are charged with jury
tampering in last week's case. . .
. . .due to your hot, naked affair with
the foreman. How do you plead?
I move for a mistrial. . .
. . .as I'm also having a hot, naked
affair with the foreman of this jury.
I'll see you during the recess.
If she wants to be taken seriously,
why not tear the judge's head off?
It is true what they say.
Women are from Persei Seven.
Men are from Persei Nine.
Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez.
Gracias.
Single Female Lawyer, where were you
the night of August 23rd?
-Sleeping with you!
-Aha!
Getting back to the matter. . . .
If it please the court. . . .
There's nothing else here.
You only wrote two pages of dialogue.
It took an hour to write. I thought
it'd take an hour to read.
-What do we do now?
-I don't know.
Say anything, if it's compelling and
mesmerizing. A tour de force.
Uh. . . .
What say you, Single Female Lawyer?
I say I'm giving up the law!
And I'm giving up being single!
Your Honor, will you marry me?
[HUMS A CLIFF-HANGER TUNE]
Oh, no! Go to commercial!
We'll be back after this word from
Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
-Married? Jenny can't get married!
-Why not? It's clever, unexpected.
That's not why people watch TV!
Clever things make people feel stupid.
Unexpected things make them
feel scared.
Attention, McNeal. Your unexpected
marriage plan scares us.
You stole our hearts as a
single female lawyer.
So shall you remain, or else!
See? TV audiences don't want
originality.
They want what they've
seen 1 000 times before.
-What you talking about, Fry?
-Trust me.
While other people lived their lives,
I watched TV.
Deep down I knew it might one
day help me save the world.
Plus I'd have lost Workman's Comp if I
went outside. Read these cue cards.
And action.
Miss McNeal, I must decline
your offer of marriage.
For you see, I'm dying.
Cough, then fall over dead.
My God, he's dead.
I'll now make my closing statement.
With my fiancé deceased. . .
. . .I hereby return to my Single
Female Lawyer career. . .
. . .no matter what any man says.
We find the defendant vulnerable,
yet spunky.
Hooray!
And cut!
Single Female Lawyer
Having lots of sex-- Huh?
McNeal, we are reasonably satisfied
with the events we have seen.
Overall, I would rate it a C-Plus.
Okay, not great.
As a result, we will not
destroy your planet.
Neither will we provide you with
our recipe for immortality.
Way to overact, Zoidberg.
Now we must return to our planet...
... to catch a 1000-year-old
Leno monologue.
-You did it, Fry!
-Yep.
It was just knowing the secret
of all TV shows.
At the end of the episode, everything
is right back to normal.
Honey unit, I'm home! Monique!
Gunculon!
[BEEPS]
I wish I could believe that.
You're my half-brother, but there's no
law against killing the other half!
All My Circuits will return
after a word...
...from Slurm. It's addictive!
[PARTY MUSIC PLAYS]
Look! It's Slurms McKenzie.
He's the original party worm!
Ooh.
Whammy-wham-wham-wazzle.
Let's party!
Look at him go! Who says
there are no more heroes?
Hey, dudes! You can win
a chance to party with me...
...at the bottling plant on Wormulon.
Look for the golden bottle cap
inside cans of Slurm.
I won!
Odds are mathematically insignificant.
I like those odds.
Rats! Just another tooth.
Ahh.
Fry & the Slurm Factory
I gotta find that golden bottle cap.
I've never seen anyone so addicted.
This is nothing. In school,
I drank 1 00 cans of cola a week.
Right up until my third heart attack.
[GROANS]
-Bender, what's wrong?
-I'm sick.
[SNEEZES]
You poor baby. Let me check
if you have a fever. Ow!
According to his temperature gauge,
which you should use next time. . .
. . .he's running a fever
of 900 degrees.
[GROANS]
Bender, mon, lie yourself down.
You're paying for that.
I'll have a look, but I'm
an expert on humans, not robots.
I'm not Bender. I'm Fry.
-I thought you were the robot.
-Nope. Human.
All right. Spare me your life story.
What's the trouble?
My tummy hurts, and I'm having
this burning electrical discharge.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
Oh, boy.
I couldn't tell him.
It's fin fungus.
He'll be floating upside down
by morning.
You should try homeopathic
medicine like zinc.
-I'm 40o/o zinc.
-Then Echinacea or St. John's wort.
Or a big fat placebo.
It's all the same crap.
What's rattling around in there?
It may be the cause of his illness.
But, more importantly, it's a reason
to try out my latest invention.
To the laboratory!
I call this the F-ray.
It's an x-ray that lets you see
through anything, even metal.
The neutrino beam it emits
is dangerous. . .
. . .so you'll all need
protective goggles.
Huh?
You may feel a slight stinging
sensation. All of you.
PROFESSOR:
Ah-ha!
-That's the reason you're ill.
-That's my watch.
I was wondering where I put that.
Now I feel much better.
Thanks, professor.
And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.
[SNICKERS]
[COUGHS]
I'll take this suit
to the decontaminators.
You lock up the F-ray.
And for the love of God, don't
let it fall into the wrong hands.
-What should we point it at first?
-Try it on me.
Ow! My sperm!
Neat. Mind if I try that again?
Didn't hurt that time.
Whoa, mama. Hold still, sexy lady.
-What?
-That's no lady!
One more upgrade and I'll
be more lady than you can handle.
Why are you so stupid?
-Bite my shiny, metal ass.
-You couldn't afford it, honey.
All this exposure to radiation
is making me thirsty.
If only we could know which
can had the winning bottle cap.
I didn't hear you. I was using
this to look inside of things.
Wait a second. I'm getting an idea.
No. False alarm. No. Yeah. No.
Yeah. No. Wait.
No. Yes!
[CRIES]
[CRIES]
This stinks.
We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm
and all we won was this junk.
I never want to see another can
of Slurm again. I'm thirsty!
Fry, are you all right?
You did it, Fry!
You found the winning bottle cap!
[WHEEZES]
Hooray!
LEELA:
Look at that.
Welcome to the planet Wormulon!
I'm Glurmo, your guide to
the splendtacular Slurm factory.
Can we have our free Slurm?
You'll have all you can drink. . .
. . .when you're partying with my
good friend, Slurms McKenzie.
[PARTY MUSIC PLAYS]
All right!
Whammy-wham-wham-wazzle!
Lay some skin on me, dudes!
The original party worm!
Are you ready to get funky with us?
He better be.
That's why we pay him, right?
Right.
Slurms has to party all night
every night or he's fired.
WEARILY:
Rock on.
Before the party, you're in
for a funderful treat.
A VIP tour of the Slurm factory.
Enjoy the tour, dudes!
I'm gonna go lie down.
Welcome to the wondrous world
of whimsy that we call. . .
. . .Slurm Centralized lndustrial
Fabrication Unit.
[GASPING]
PROFESSOR:
Oh, my!
BENDER:
Look, flowers! And a boat!
[GRUNTING]
Who are those
horrible orange creatures?
Those are the Grunka Lunkas!
-They work in the factory.
-Tell them I hate them.
As we sail down the Slurm,
you'll see our mixologists at work.
They take 900
of the finest ingredients. . .
. . .add some child-like delight. . .
. . .and mix it with
glacial spring water. . .
. . .from our spring water generator.
Then we add the secret ingredient. . .
. . .that makes Slurm
so deliciously addictive.
-What's the secret ingredient?
-Whatever you want it to be!
-But what is it really?
-That's not for you to know.
Here the Grunka Lunkas are
inducing Wumpus berries. . .
. . .to release their flavor,
using sensual massage.
Psst.
-Those berries are the secret, right?
-No.
-You positive?
-Yes.
-Because they look kind of secret.
-Enough!
-There will be no more questions.
-Why?
Hey, look! The disgusting little men
are starting to sing.
Grunka Lunka dunkity doo
We've got a friendly warning for you
Grunka Lunka dunkity dasis
The secret of Slurm's
On a need-to-know basis
Asking questions in school
ls a great way to learn
If you try that stuff here
You might get your legs broke
We once found a dead guy
Face-down in the Slurm
It could easily happen again
To you folks
So keep your head down
And keep your mouth shut
Grunka Lunka Lunka dunkity dot
I don't pay you to sing.
You just used your bathroom break.
-Hard ass.
-I heard that.
On your right,
you see the Slurm Master. . .
. . .checking for color and bouquet.
So thirsty.
Then he tastes it.
He tastes it and tastes it.
Then tastes it more.
Could I have some Slurm?
No food or drink on the tour.
Wait until you party
with Slurms McKenzie.
-When is that?
-Soon enough.
-That's not soon enough.
-What's behind that door?
-Nothing.
-Is it the secret ingredient?
Grunka Lunka dunkity dinkredient
You should not ask
About secret ingredient
Okay, we get the point.
I was curious about the guards.
-Grunka Lunka dunkity darned guards--
-Shut up.
I could fire my staff and hire
Grunka Lunkas at half the cost?
That's right.
They don't have a good union.
They're like slaves.
What are you doing?
I'm thirsty. Grab my feet
and dunk my head in.
No. That's moronic.
Fine. I'll swim around
and drink as much as I want.
Help! I can't swim!
[WHISTLES]
Why did you jump in?
Everybody was doing it.
I just wanted to be popular.
[SCREAMING]
BENDER:
Ow!
Where are we?
And why is Slurm
pouring into this sewer?
This isn't Slurm.
Something's rotten on Wormulon. Look.
This is all about
the secret ingredient.
My God, what if the secret ingredient
is people?
There's already a soda like that.
Soylent Cola.
-How is it?
-It varies from person to person.
Do you have anything looser
around the thorax?
Yes, over in--
Weren't there more people
at the start of the tour?
Fry, Leela and Bender are missing.
If you'll excuse me.
Quick!
Phew.
Look! Slurm! Finally!
I'm never going 1 2 minutes
without a Slurm again.
This must be where they
put in the secret ingredient.
Whatever it is,
it's even better fresh.
Still warm.
-Oh!
-Ick!
Lordy!
Fry!
Phew.
Fry!
That's the secret ingredient?
-That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
-Ew!
[SCREAMING]
[GROANS]
I'll save us!
Oh, that feels good.
Thanks, Bender.
The exit! We made it.
Your Majesty, I brought the prisoners.
Well, my friends, you learned
the secret of Slurm.
That concludes the part
where you're alive.
You wish, you slimy worm.
Good work.
You have pleased your queen.
-Thanks, Your Majesty.
-Thanks.
People are drinking something
from your behind? It's gross.
Is it? Honey comes
from a bee's behind.
Milk is from a cow's behind.
Do you use toothpaste?
-Whose behind is that?
-I won't say.
We came to party with Slurms McKenzie.
-By the way, when is that scheduled?
-Never!
To the torture cave!
You, my metal friend. . .
. . .will have the honor
of becoming 1 74 Slurm cans.
This trip is a big letdown.
You will be submerged
in royal Slurm. . .
. . .which will turn you
into a Slurm queen like myself.
But she's a commoner.
Her Slurm will taste foul.
Yes! Which is why
we'll market it as New Slurm.
When everyone hates it. . .
. . .we'll bring back Slurm Classic
and make billions.
-What about me?
-You're free to go.
-Yes!
-If you can resist this SuperSlurm.
It's so delicious,
you'll eat until you explode.
Which reminds me, put a tarp
over that sofa. Bon appťtit.
Mmm.
Farewell.
And congratulations again
on winning the contest.
Fry, untie us!
Here I come! Let me just--
One more taste.
You pig! Stop stuffing
your craw and save us!
-I can't see. Are we boned?
-Yeah, we're boned.
I can't stop eating
this delicious ooze.
But I won't let you die.
LEELA: Hurry!
BENDER: What's happening?
Phew.
Just in time!
No!
I could fit if I didn't
have these damn arms.
We're close. I can smell
those orange guys.
-Stop right there!
BENDER: Slurms McKenzie!
-Take me with you.
-Say what?
I'm partied out. All I want
is to stay home and rent videos.
-Is that so much to ask?
-Forget it!
This says you have to party with us.
All right! But not too many people.
I want to keep it small.
No can do, Slurms.
[SCREAMING]
This way!
-She's gaining on us!
-I'll hold her off.
But she'll crush you like a worm.
A smaller worm.
It's all right.
I'm so tired of partying.
So very tired.
I'll save you the only way I know how.
By partying!
-Babes?
-Mr. McKenzie?
You've served me well.
But this time, I party alone.
-But--
-There'll be other parties.
Now go! Go!
[PARTY MUSIC PLAYS]
Party on, Slurms.
Party on, contest winners. Party on.
No! We're ruined.
They know our disgusting secret!
My crew has made
a horrific discovery.
It seems that Slurm is produced
in a colossal worm hiney.
Hiney, you say.
With your testimony...
... we can finally outla w
this insidious Slurm.
Outlaw Slurm?
Don't pay any attention to him.
Grandpa 's making up stories again.
I'm not your grandpa.
You're my uncle from the year 2000.
Okay, Grandpa.
We'll take care of the bad worms,
don 't you worry.
I wish Slurms McKenzie
were here to enjoy this.
Yeah, he sure loved to party.
How about we all party
one last time for him?
-For Slurms.
-For Slurms.
[PARTY MUSIC PLAYS]
Hey, that's not that bad.
Mmm.
Futurama <i>is brought to you</i>
<i>by Glagnar's Human Rinds.</i>
<i>It's a Bunch-a-Munch-a-</i>
<i>Crunch-a-Humans!</i>
I Second That Emotion
Somebody likes snouts.
Is it me?
Oh, my head! My precious head!
Stupid can opener! You killed
my father and now you want me!
- You all right, Bender?
- I guess so.
But why do we keep this time bomb
around for that dumb animal?
Don't yell at him.
You hurt his feelings.
- Come on, pet him and make up.
- No.
I said, pet him.
I'll pet him.
I'll pet him with both hands!
My ass! Get off! Get off!
- Are you okay?
- Nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
Not you.
Poor baby chipped a fang.
I got a busted ass!
I don't see anyone kissing it!
All right, I'm coming.
Remember, Rover gets the pill,
and Pepper gets the suppository. Next!
It's just a broken fang. Not serious.
What's that? You have to put him down?
No. Huh? What?
Terrible shame. Shall I do the honors?
No!
- You about done?
- Next time, I'm keeping it.
I have a replacement fang
for your pet in the next room.
The jaguar wasn't helpful,
but he did knock one of my teeth out.
Now, then.
What are these rings
in Nibbler's fang?
I'm woozy from a gazelle kick earlier,
but if he's like a tree...
...the rings might indicate his age.
Good luck. It'd take a genius
to count all those rings.
He's 5.
Happy birthday, young Nibbler.
Look how cuddly he looks
in his new cape.
I'd be cuddly if someone
gave me a cape.
Who's playing pin the tail
on the maggot?
Me! Everyone watch how good I am!
And the crowd goes wild!
What prize do I get? Cash?
Look at Nibbler.
Oh, he's holding a spoon.
- He's so talented.
- You call that talent?
Gather around old Bender and get ready
for the show of a lifetime.
- Now he's wearing a hat!
- Let's all sing "Happy Birthday"!
W<i>hat day is today?</i>
<i>It's Nibbler's birthday</i>
W<i>hat a day for a birthday</i>
<i>Let's all have some cake</i>
<i>And you smell like one too</i>
What about this?
Bender, aren't you cooking
for this party?
- Fine. We'll have rack of Nibbler!
- Just make a cake. And this time...
...if someone jumps out of it,
put them in after it's cooked.
So it's a cake you want, is it?
I'll make you a cake
you'll never forget.
That'll take care of those rats.
Now, to bake a cake so delicious...
...they'll have no choice
but to love and worship me.
There! This'll teach those
filthy bastards who's lovable.
Once I spell check it,
it'll be ready for my admiring public.
No! Get away from there!
That's it.
Happy birthday!
Bender, what's going...?
No!
Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
How could you flush Nibbler
down the toilet?
Step one, I lifted the seat.
That was the first annoyance.
Am I right, men?
Aren't you upset at all? What if
I flushed Fry down the toilet?
Only one way to find out.
You have no sympathy for anyone!
Sure I do!
Right now I feel sorry for you.
- You do?
- Yeah. One cantaloupe-sized eye?
You ain't winning
no beauty pageants, lady.
And so we say goodbye
to our beloved pet, Nibbler...
...who's gone to a place where I,
too, hope one day to go.
The toilet.
I wouldn't feel so bad...
...if Bender just understood
the pain he caused me.
<i>Give it to me straight, doc.</i>
<i>Don 't sugarcoat it.</i>
<i>Your entire family died when a plane</i>
<i>piloted by your fiancée...</i>
<i>... crashed into your uninsured home.</i>
<i>And you have inoperable cancer.</i>
Bet you didn't expect that one!
Does he not understand
humanoid emotion?
I just wish Bender could feel
exactly what I feel.
Through the miracle of science,
that can be done.
Is this another experiment
that crosses a line...
...man was not meant to cross?
<i>The official death toll</i>
<i>in that tragic rocket crash...</i>
<i>... has now been raised to 54,000.</i>
What the hell are you doing
with my head?
- I need to tinker in it.
- Just use a potted plant like Fry!
<i>Q</i>uiet, you.
I'm installing an empathy chip.
To allow Bender to feel emotions?
Yes, if by "allow" you mean "force. "
- Son of... Careful!
- Oh, dear.
Oh, my. I got it. Who wants more?
- Professor!
- Steady, now. There we go.
Now I'll simply tune it
to Leela's emotional frequency.
My God, I'm overcome with feelings.
I'm experiencing
a powerful yearning...
...to cram my gullet
with mackerel heads.
That's me, baby.
I feel I'm not as smart as Leela...
...but I also feel relieved
that I'm cuter than her.
- That's me.
- Thanks for covering.
Now I miss Nibbler,
and I feel nosy and opinionated.
- Bingo!
- It's her!
Thanks. I'm happy Bender can finally
feel my pain.
Happy. I like this feeling.
Don't revert to your usual mopey self.
I'm not mopey. You shut up!
Anger, huh?
How dare you make me feel anger...
...you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet?
Thanks for taking me out.
I'm now slightly less miserable.
You know what'd cheer you up?
Getting a puppy!
A puppy?
Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
- What's your problem?
- I miss Nibbler.
- You do?
- Hell, no! It's Leela's feelings!
Why can't she just drink herself happy
like a normal person?
- Jealousy. You think you're so hot!
- Wha...?
You only get all the guys
because you dress like a tramp!
They're responding to my personality!
Armando and I are going
to the back seat of his car for coffee.
- Will you be all right by yourself?
- Sure, I'm having a great time. Really!
You two go enjoy yourselves.
I'm so Ionely. I'm gonna go eat
a bucket of ice cream.
A bucket of...
The spoon's in the foot powder!
I'm at the end of my rope.
I can't live another minute
without sweet Nibbler.
Alligators can live in sewers
after you flush them.
- Really?
- Yep.
My friend's cousin's caseworker
saw one. It's a widely believed fact.
Sewers...
Thinking, thinking, thinking.
Hang on, Nibbler!
Uncle Bender's coming to save you!
Damn, it's too small.
What did those humans
design this for anyway?
Ah-ha!
Bender, one. Toilet, zero.
See you on the other side!
Bender? Bender?!
Have you seen my sombrero?
He flushed himself down the toilet?
- Who's next?
- It's your fault.
Your emotions made him feel bad.
You're right. I feel terrible.
Now you're making him feel worse!
We better go down and find him.
Are you crazy? There's mutants there!
- They'll eat you alive!
- They're hideous!
Mutants are just a ridiculous
urban myth.
Don't be so sure.
Many scientists believe humans
could mutate down there...
...due to exposure to toxic waste,
radioactive runoff...
...and good old American feces.
God bless America.
Ladies first.
Oh, and the aftertaste.
- What?
- I burned my finger!
- Check the guidebook.
- We're under Park Avenue. Ritzy!
Just think. All this was probably
once a charity luncheon for the Met.
Wait, what's that?
Why did I throw out the manual?
You didn't have to come down here.
I know, but I just missed
Nibbler so much.
- He was so cute.
- He was so sweet.
This emotional display
is making me nauseous.
Or maybe it's from that.
Nibbler!
It's no use. We'd better turn back.
Which way, Fry?
According to this map,
the only exit is through that pipe.
It gets wider after a mile.
- Idiot.
- Idiot.
Okay, never mind.
I'll just ask those people
for directions.
Mutants!
Mutants! They're real!
I'll take care of this!
Back! Back!
Thanks, handsome.
- Don't worry, we're harmless.
- I have three arms!
- I said, harmless not armless!
- Lay off him. He only has one ear.
Shouldn't you eat my brain?
You're mutants!
Mutants? Perhaps you are the mutants.
Dwayne, have you looked
in a mirror lately?
Welcome to our village.
It's not Paris...
...but it has a charm
that I wouldn't trade for the world.
- You do realize you live in a sewer.
- Perhaps your civilization...
...is the sewer of an even greater
society above you.
- No, we're on top.
- Daylight and everything.
It must be wonderful!
We came down here to find our pet.
He was flushed down the toilet
If he was flushed,
he probably came through here.
Everything always does. Follow me.
All that is ours
came from your toilets.
Over there is our aquarium.
This is our library.
Just crumpled porn and Ayn Rand.
Over here is our church.
You guys worship an unexploded
nuclear bomb?
Nobody's that observant.
It's mainly for Christmas and Easter.
Nibbler!
Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums!
Do alligators flushed down
toilets live here?
That's an urban legend.
- Then what are those?
- Crocodiles.
They're our pets.
When they grow too large,
we flush them into the sub-sewer.
There's a race of sub-mutants there.
Please! That's just
a sub-urban legend.
Then I suppose you also don't believe
in El Chupakneebray.
El Chupakneebray? What's that?
Gather around for the legend
of El Chupakneebray.
<i>He creeps in the midnight hush</i>
<i>Silent as a low-flow toilet flush</i>
<i>But sooner or later</i>
<i>He'll eat you whole</i>
<i>And half your alligator</i>
- Crocodile.
- Whatever.
Our pet, Nibbler, loves fresh crocodile.
It's his favorite treat.
He must be El Chupakneebray.
Hey, yeah!
You unleashed
El Chupakneebray upon us?
Then you are our sworn enemies!
He would never hurt people.
Let us help you capture him.
Impossible. If legend's true, our
only hope is to give a snack-rifice!
Yes, an unspoiled virgin.
- I volunteer!
- Nice try, Leela...
...but we've all seen
Zapp Brannigan's web page.
Oh, I made myself feel bad.
- She'll do.
- Chain her to the post!
And rip her shirt a little.
Behold! When El Chupakneebray
comes for the, uh, "virgin"...
...he will be snared
by this rope trap.
El Chupakneebray comes soon.
It is nightfall.
Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
- The tide is coming in.
- <i>Q</i>uiet. The beast approaches.
Nibbler! Come here, precious.
Look, everyone. It's El Chupakneebray.
- That's not him.
- Say what?
That's El Chupakneebray!
I'll take care of this!
- Do something!
- I'm too scared!
Your fear is being
transmitted to Bender!
If you care about Nibbler,
stop caring!
I can't! I love all creatures!
- Even me?
- As a friend.
Damn.
Listen to me.
I'm an expert at not caring.
The secret is not giving
a rat's ass about anyone...
...and only caring about things
that you want...
...that you deserve,
that the world owes you!
- Well, I could use a new tank top.
- Bigger! Bigger!
A fashionable tank top! And designer
boots encrusted with jewels!
You'll need some pants
to go with that!
And I could afford it all if I didn't
have to feed that stupid Nibbler!
Bender is back!
I'll save you, Nibbler!
- He'll be killed!
- Know what else I could use?
A weekend at a fancy spa.
And a Toblerone.
You did it!
- Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
- No, thanks.
Gather around to hear
the legend of Bender.
<i>He came from above with a...</i>
It'll be ages before another
guitar string is flushed.
- That's a disgusting story.
- All thanks to Bender.
- I love you, Bender.
- I love you too.
Get that stupid chip out of me
before I kill myself.
You won't believe this,
but the empathy chip burned out.
The emotion you felt for Nibbler
was your own!
So Bender learned a lesson...
...about respecting other people's
feelings after all.
No, I'm wrong. The chip was running
at triple capacity.
And I still barely felt anything.
Good night, losers!
Maybe Bender didn't learn from me...
...but I learned something from him.
So long, jerkwads!
So long!

Horsy to Pointy Guy Six.
Check.
Get him, boys!
Good move.
Brannigan Begins Again
Good news.
We have a mission to further
intergalactic peace.
- Nope. Watching cartoons.
- Sorry.
What's the mission?
A delivery for the Democratic
Order of Planets.
What's that?
It's like the United Nations
from your time, Fry.
Or like the Federation
from <i>Star Trek.</i>
Tonight's the ribbon cutting
for DOOP's new base.
- What are we delivering?
- Something necessary to the ceremony.
- The oversized scissors.
- We'll deliver them as fast as we can.
Okay. But don't run with them!
Wow, a million aliens. I've never seen
anything so mind-blowing!
- A reception table with muffins!
- Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the ribbon cutting
for the DOOP's new headquarters.
A fitting home for an organization
that fosters peace everywhere.
Even between the Insectoids
and the Space Lizards.
- What's it like on Amazonia?
- Big rats there.
- Me crush with club.
- That's so interesting.
Why don't we have coffee together?
There's no better place
for a home of diplomacy...
...than here orbiting
the Neutral Planet.
What are your thoughts,
Your Neutralness?
I have no strong feelings one way
or the other.
I hate these filthy Neutrals.
You know where enemies stand.
But with Neutrals, who knows?
It sickens me.
Halt! Why, Leela!
I do believe we've met.
- He means you guys did it.
- We brought scissors for the ceremony.
- Then you're under arrest.
- Why?
How do I know these aren't part
of a Neutral plot?
They're not sharp. Who could I hurt?
The Yarn People of Nylar Four.
So a plan to assassinate
a weird-Iooking alien with scissors.
How very Neutral of you.
- What?
- It was almost the perfect crime.
But you forgot one thing:
Rock crushes scissors.
But paper covers rock.
And scissors cuts paper.
Kif, we have a conundrum.
Search them for paper.
- And bring me a rock.
- Why?
So beautiful, yet so Neutral.
Drag them to the ship!
To cut the ribbon, the legendary
DOOP captain...
...who just returned from a
carpet-bombing of Eden Seven...
...Zapp Brannigan.
What makes a man turn Neutral?
Lust for gold? Power?
Or were you born
with a heart of Neutrality?
Sir? You should be cutting
the ribbon now.
No matter. I'll simply cut it
from here with the ship's laser.
That may not be wise.
Kif, I don't need your
that-may-not-be-wise attitude.
Whoopsie-daisy.
You are accused of blowing up
DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?
- Absolutely 99 percent not guilty.
- The prosecutor will call a witness.
Your Honor, I'm a simple hyper-chicken
from a backwoods asteroid...
...but if it please the court,
I'll call the entire jury.
- I'll allow it.
- Members of the jury...
...did you all happen to gander...
...at who blew up that there
DOOP headquarters?
That's the guy there.
- Are you gonna vote to convict him?
- You better believe it.
The jury will disregard its testimony.
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.
The evidence against Brannigan
is strong.
But, in light of his service,
and this incompetent prosecutor...
...I'm afraid I must dismiss
all charges.
What? Your Honor, I know the case
is closed and you've given a verdict...
...but I want to testify.
- I'll allow it.
Miss Leela, on the date in question...
...were you or weren't you
wearing a skirt?
That's a dumb question. What matters
is Zapp's the worst captain ever.
I saw him blow up DOOP headquarters
with my own eye.
- I'd like to cross-examine.
- I'll allow it.
- We've met before, have we not?
- Yes.
On that occasion,
you had sex with someone?
- May I remind you, you're under oath.
- Yes.
Please point out the person
you had sex with.
- And his name is?
- Zapp Brannigan.
The same man who didn't blow up
DOOP headquarters.
I rest my case.
Jury members, you may begin
your deliberations.
Your Honor, we have reached a verdict.
We find the defendant guilty.
You are hereby stripped
of your rank...
...and dismissed from the DOOP.
I'd like to make one final statement.
Kif, come and hold up the flag.
Wave it a little, for God's sake.
You can take away a man's title
and his uniform.
But you can't take away
his integrity and honor.
- Plus, it was Kif's fault.
- What?
You too are stripped of your rank...
...and dishonorably discharged.
One day a man has everything.
Then he blows up a $400 billion
space station.
Next he has nothing. Makes you think.
- No, it doesn't.
- Come, Kif.
It's time to begin our life as
civilians. That's an order, soldier!
- Hey, Bender?
- Yeah?
This is the third hose fight
I've broken up.
And the second one with real hoses.
Move your asses and scrub
the ship like I ordered!
- You don't have to get so mad.
- Fry wiped off some of the dirt.
- Zapp?
- I didn't know where else to turn.
- You're the only one who loved me.
- I never loved you.
- Physically.
- What is it?
Let me work for food. I'll paint,
or service you sexually, or mop up.
- You can't do any of those things.
- Kif might.
- Who are you talking to?
- Just a hobo who's hit rock bottom...
...and his commander.
- You're that disgraced captain.
He'll distract people from our
awful safety record. Come in!
I want everyone to meet our new
employees. Which ones are new?
- The green dude and the fat man.
- I haven't seen that robot before.
I'm Bender. You know,
the lovable rascal.
Oh, yes. My good friend, of course.
Whoever you all are, I have good news.
You have a delivery to Stumbos Four.
The gravity is so high...
...you might be crushed
by your own hair.
Enjoy!
So this Leela.
I know she's a very sensuous woman.
- How is she as a captain?
- Really strict.
- And mean.
- I see.
- Does she spank the crew?
- No, she just makes us work.
Good. But should she ever institute
some sort of spanking policy...
...I'll go for you. I won't have
my comrades harmed.
Hey, this guy's all right!
Here's to us poor schmoes working
for the man.
Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man.
- I computed our landing coordinates.
- Thanks. Very nice work.
- Wait, what?
- I said, "Very nice work. "
This is the happiest day of my life.
Okay, crew. You have to deliver
these 40 pillows to the hotel.
Not heavy, but I'm still complaining.
That's because we have
an anti-grav pump.
Once you're out there,
gravity will be very intense.
Hey, no prob.
This lead apron will protect me.
No screw-ups.
Use the hover dolly and deliver
one pillow at a time.
- Let's deliver them all at once!
- Yeah!
That's using your noodle.
Come on, girdle. Hold...
What the hell happened?
Some breaking, involving the dolly.
That's all we know.
I told you idiots
not to overload it.
- Each pillow weighs 150 Ibs. Here.
- Don't get your panties in a knot.
- We'll use the backup.
- I'll load pillows.
No way. You disobeyed an order...
...so now you have to hand-deliver
all 40 pillows.
I have a serious question.
Does the company that
made your bra do girdles?
- I ask because a friend...
- Just get to work!
- I'm Leela. Get to work.
- I agree.
The point is, it's just so
humiliating working for him.
Once he actually ordered me to...
...shave his armpits while
he was in the tub. So I...
Why don't we talk about
something besides Zapp?
Oh, all right.
Well, how about them, um...
Okay, well, there he was
in the tub, right?
Some good old high-gravity rain.
That'll cool us off.
This is Leela's fault.
If she let us use the backup,
we'd have broken it and given up.
A good captain needs many skills...
...like boldness, daring,
and a velour uniform.
I'm not convinced
she has any of those.
Leela's not too bad.
She just makes us work so much.
When I was captain,
I only wanted my men's Ioyalty.
If I had that,
I didn't care if they...
...drank beer in their underwear.
- Beer?
- Underwear?
But now, Zapp's not
captain anymore. I'm free!
Hear that? I'm actually laughing.
This is a mutiny!
You're out of here, lady.
Zapp's the new captain.
All hail the new captain!
You're a capable doer of the nasty...
...but I'm taking over.
- On what grounds, you oaf?
Failure to prevent a mutiny.
Throw her in the brig.
- What brig?
- Then the laundry room...
...which will hereafter
be called the "brig. "
- You don't want me as captain?
- Right, genius.
- Didn't I do well?
- You were mean. You yelled.
- You made us work.
- A captain needs to do that.
- I thought we were friends.
- Well...
...you shouldn't have been so mean.
- Don't worry.
Soon we'll be able to look back
on this and laugh.
Back in uniform. It nearly
still fits...
...despite the fattening hobo diet.
- What do I do with these clothes?
- Put them in the laundry brig.
- Do I have your Ioyalty?
- To the ends of the universe.
- Ten hundred percent.
- That's not enough.
You're to sit and drink
until you're as Ioyal as Kif.
- Yes, sir, sir!
- May I have a beer, sir?
No. You're Ioyal enough.
Meanwhile, I have a plan.
We'll attack our archenemy,
the Neutral Planet.
- Oh, jeez.
- Once the threat is gone...
...I'll be a hero and the DOOP
will reinstate me.
- Sir, that plan makes no sense.
- Maybe not to you.
But you were court-martialed
in disgrace.
- Burn!
- Nailed you, buddy!
Prepare for the fight between
good and Neutral.
Awesome! We'll be like,
pow-pow-pow!
And they'll be like...
...and we'll have pancakes
to celebrate. And I'll be like...
Precisely. Now, in the name of all
that is honorable...
...we'll call them with a message
of peace, then fire.
Yes, sir.
Fly the white flag of war.
<i>This is Zapp Brannigan, of the ship...</i>
<i>Planet Express Ship.</i>
<i>- I come in peace.</i>
- Can we trust him, Your Neutralness?
All I know is my gut says maybe.
- What now?
- We crash into the headquarters...
...killing them in a firestorm
from which nothing can escape.
- And then?
- Then your mission is complete.
I'll already have ejected
wearing the only space suit.
- Wait. Is this gonna kill us?
- Yes. That's what I meant by Ioyalty.
Now help me into the only suit.
It's sweaty.
You may need baby powder.
- We want you back as captain.
- Let me guess. He canceled naptime?
He ran out of beer?
So he's about to kill us?
- We want Leela to be captain.
- Mutiny?
Never thought I'd see the day.
Come, Kif.
- There's a child's suit for you.
- I want to stay here with Leela.
She actually listens
to what I have to...
He's disabled the steering!
We're gonna crash!
Leela, save me! And yourself, I guess.
And my banjo!
And Fry.
Okay. We have one chance.
- Will you do what I say?
- Absolutely.
- Even if I make you work?
- As your God is my witness.
Get the backup dolly and put all dark
matter into the left engine.
Aw, man! That crap's heavy!
- And warm.
- Just do it!
Your Neutralness, beige alert.
If I die, tell my wife, "Hello. "
I don't want to die at age 25.
<i>Unless we hit a time warp,</i>
<i>don 't worry about it.</i>
- It's too low!
- <i>Q</i>uick!
You did it! You actually did it!
And no one will be punished
for the mutiny!
When Leela panicked,
maybe because of female troubles...
...my quick mind saved the day.
- Is this tale of magic and glory true?
- Well, actually...
Good. If they don't take him
back, we'll keep him.
It's true. My female incompetence,
his cat-like reflexes...
...the stuff that made no sense,
all of it.
In that case, Zapp Brannigan...
...I hereby restore your rank
and parking privileges.
Come, Kif. We've got work to do.
I'll call and tell you about it.
Leela, even though you're mean...
...you're the best captain ever.
- Yeah. You're one dynamite lady.
- Can we have a week off?
- No.
- Please?
- Come on, captain.
- Oh, all right.
- No time off.
- Oh, man.
- Let's mutiny.

Wait, my eyes aren't that bad.
I can read the large print books.
It's not...!
Well, lucky I can read braille.
Hey, look, a weird mirror.
Cursed by his own hubris.
A debate's on!
Change the channel!
That's what Fry said
when we turned on the debate.
<i>C- Span</i> 9 <i>presents</i>
<i>"The Thrill of Politics. "</i>
There are no car chases...
...but one of these men will become
president of the world.
So? We live in the United States.
That's part of the world.
I have been gone a long time.
It's time someone
had the courage to say:
"I'm against things everybody hates. "
I respect my opponent.
He's a good man.
But frankly, I agree with everything
he just said!
These candidates sound like clones.
Wait, they are clones!
Even with identical DNA,
they differ on key issues.
Your three-cent titanium tax
goes too far!
Your three-cent titanium tax
doesn't go too far enough!
If I were registered,
I'd send a message...
...by staying home on election day,
dressed like a clown.
- You're not registered?
- Not vaccinated, either.
One vote never made a difference.
The first robot president won
by exactly one vote.
John <i>Q</i>uincy Adding Machine.
He enticed voters by pledging
not to go on a killing spree.
But, like most, he promised
more than he could deliver.
One vote can make a difference...
...and even though it won't,
you're going to register.
Yes, that's a capital idea!
Let's all go register.
When did you care about voting?
The very instant I became old.
The problem is,
both parties give your tax dollars...
...to the less fortunate.
They get all the breaks!
You could join a third party, maybe.
Only weirdos and mutants
join third parties.
I'd better keep an eye out
at the next meeting.
- What's your party, Bender?
- I can't vote.
- Because you're a robot?
- No, a felon.
We favor huge subsidies
to the Brain Slug planet.
Okay, but what are the Brain Slugs
gonna do for the working man?
- Attach Brain Slugs to them.
- Sure, you say that now.
Is it true you can make shirts
and rope out of hemp?
Dave's not here, man.
- I heard hemp makes great shampoo.
- It does?
No way!
I gotta check out this brochure.
What are you doing to protect my right
to bear doomsday devices?
We'll get rid of the three-day
waiting period for mad scientists.
Today, the mad scientist can't get
a doomsday device...
...tomorrow, the mad grad student.
Where will it end?
Amen! I don't go anywhere
without my mutated anthrax...
...for duck hunting.
Sure, humans are cute...
...but how will we test cosmetics?
I concur.
Here's a party to get excited about.
Sign me up.
Not with that attitude.
- Okay, screw it.
- Welcome aboard, brother!
- All right!
- You're out.
I'm actually getting interested
in politics.

- I'm rich!
- What do you mean?
My body's 40 percent titanium.
I'm finally richer than those
snooty ATMs.
- Too bad you can't spend it.
- Oh, can't I?
- No.
- Watch me, poor man.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Game's over, losers.
I have all the money.
Compare your lives to mine,
and then kill yourselves.
Hey, get away!
You get five dollars to not do
what you're thinking about.
You just lost five dollars.
Hey, buddy, little help?
Thank you!
Hello, peasants.
What happened to you?
Yeah, did you get a haircut?
No, I sold my body!
Sold your body?
Bender, I've been down that road.
It's glamorous,
the parties are great...
...but you'll spend every dollar
on jewelry and skintight pants.
How are you gonna live without a body?
Bodies are for hookers and fat people.
All I need is a wad of
cash with a head.
- Now you can pay off your loan shark.
- What's he gonna do, break my legs?
This is the life.
Another martini, please?
Shaken, not stirred.
Yeah!
Put it all on black.
21 red.
I beg your pardon, 33 black.
Yes!
The rich get richer!
Strike!
In your face, Leela!
Timber!
Can I ride in your car?
No, it looks like your neck stepped
in something.
Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body.
Look me in the shins and say that!
I've had it up to here
with this place.
I'm off to hang out with classy heads
like me, who appreciate...
...poetry, philosophy, hats.
So long, coffin stuffers!
Could one of you coffin stuffers
please carry me?
Which group of heads is good enough
for me?
What do you think, Fry?
Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.
I recognize you.
Didn't you have a body?
Yeah, but it was holding me back.
I just did the cover of
the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> Swim Cap Issue.
You're looking great.
- I'd like to lose a few pounds.
- Couldn't hurt.
U.S. presidents.
Sturdy shelves, good security.
This place has class.
Hi, sugar. Legally, nothing I can do
counts as sex anymore.
I apologize. He gets this way
around meaty-Iooking women.
I remember you.
I was gonna vote for you.
But voting isn't cool,
so I got trashed on Listerine.
I've never felt voting is essential
to the process.
No kidding, Ford.
So the hooker-bot says,
"That's not my expansion slot"...
...and my friend says,
"That's not my 25-pin connector! "
Bender, thou robots
really cracketh me up.
I like it here.
What's the rent for a jar?
Sorry, we can't let every
Tom, Dick and Harry move in.
No offense,
Jefferson, Nixon and Truman.
How about the closet
of presidential losers?
Bob Dole needs company.
LaRouche won't stop telling jokes.
- Pass.
- What hath happened to your body?
- I hocked it.
- Why wouldst thou do that?
- Same reason you hocked your teeth.
- Ah, booze money.
I remember my body:
Flabby, pasty-skinned,
riddled with phlebitis.
A good Republican body.
God, I loved it.
I spent my teen years loving my body.
Of course, it was tough love...
He opened relations with China.
He doesn't care about your ding-dong.
Even if you miss your body,
being a head's great too?
No, son.
It's a sad and Ionely life.
Great!
Now you tell me.
That's my style.
Kick them when they're down.
Ones, zeros...
...one, one, zero, zero, one...
- Bender, what is it?
- What an awful dream.
Ones and zeros everywhere!
And I thought I saw a two.
It was just a dream.
There are no twos.
I know what's wrong. My body loved me,
and I turned its back on it.
Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon
round your neck. I'm coming home!
You sold my body!
To who?
I can't reveal that.
But I'll give you $50 for the kid.
- My clothes are worth 50 bucks.
- Deal.
How could I let this happen?
I can't go through life like this!
- What about your self-destruct button?
- It's on my body!
What am I gonna do?
I can't stand to see a robot cry.
Let's watch TV.
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm throwing my head into the ring.
I'm announcing my candidacy
for the Presidency of Earth!
Sir, the Constitution states...
...nobody can be elected president
more than twice.
That's right, no "body. "
But, as you can plainly see,
I've got a shiny new body.
Bender, he's got your body!
That double-crossing bastard!
How dare he run off with Nixon!
- He must have bought your body.
- And that electric guitar.
I'm meeting you halfway,
you stupid hippies.
I am not a crook's head.
Yeah, you are!
You stole my body.
Fry, Leela, you gotta help me.
Ordinarily I'd say no, and how
it's your fault for being an idiot.
But when a robotic Nixon is loose,
we have to take action!
Idiot.
Morbo will introduce the candidates.
Puny human number one.
Puny human number two.
And my good friend, Richard Nixon.
Hello, Morbo.
How's the family?
Belligerent and numerous.
Good man.
Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
First he steals my body,
now he's touching my stuff.
We've got to find a way
to talk to him.
Morbo demands an answer
to the following question:
If you saw candy in the hands
of a small child...
...would you seize and eat it?
Unthinkable!
Wouldn't think it!
What about you, Mr. Nixon?
You are under a truth-o-scope.
The question is vague.
You don't say what kind of candy,
whether anyone is watching...
I certainly wouldn't harm the child.
You scored big points.
What?
They ate me alive out there.
But your body's message was,
"Look at my shiny new body. "
You've got real charisma
from the neck down.
Nixon with charisma?
My God, I can rule the universe!
Give my body back, you thief!
Look here, you drugged-out communist.
I paid for this body...
...and I'd no sooner return it
than I would my dog.
Shut up!
Please, we're appealing
to your sense of decency.
Seriously, I'm never giving back
this body.
Beat it! Or I'll get Cambodian
on your asses!
It's hopeless. We might as well turn
in my head for the five-cent deposit.
My best friend's not getting recycled!
Not for five cents,
not for 500 cents.
- I have a plan.
- I have a better plan.
Why would Nixon stay here?
You get a discount
if you've been here before.
Keep going.
We're right behind you.
Whoa, mama.
Get a room, you two!
- We're in a room!
- Then lose some weight!
Oh, yeah. You women's libbers
really know how to party.
There I am.
Hey, Betty Friedan,
send a little of that lotion my way.
Okay. Almost got it.
Steady. Steady.
Don't panic.
- You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve.
- I want what's mine!
- Don't make me kick your neck.
- Bring it on, soup can.
Break it up, you two!
That's it!
You're going to jail!
And I don't grant pardons
like that sissy, Ford.
You won't pardon anyone,
because you won't get elected.
The voters aren't pea-brained
idiots anymore.
No? Listen here, missy.
Computers may be twice as fast
as they were in 1973...
...but voters are as drunk
and stupid as ever!
The only one who's changed is me.
I've become bitter and crazy.
Once I'm in office, I'll sell our
children's organs to zoos for meat!
I'll go into people's houses at
night and wreck up the place!
He lost my vote.
One vote won't make a difference.
Excuse me, while I inch myself over
to the phone and call the police.
Not so fast, Nixon!
Are you familiar with audio tape?
I don't like where this is heading.
<i>I'll go into people's houses at</i>
<i>night and wreck up the place!</i>
I really sound like that?
I thought I had a Clark Gable quality.
We'll trade you the tape
for the body.
Oh, expletive deleted!
You've got a deal.
Hey, I've got one last thought.
It's good to be back
in one piece again...
...except for these damn
bumper stickers.
<i>The sheer drama has driven turnout</i>
<i>to its highest level in centuries...</i>
<i>... six percent!</i>
<i>Exit polls show evil underdog</i>
<i>Richard Nixon...</i>
<i>... trailing with zero votes.</i>
Yes, the system works!
<i>The time is 7:5</i>9<i>,</i>
<i>and the robot polls are opening.</i>
<i>The robot vote is in.</i>
<i>Nixon has won!</i>
Why'd they vote for him,
now that he's just a head?
I give you the next
president of Earth!
Nixon's back!
I can't believe it.
He won by a single vote.
It ain't my fault.
I'm a non-voting felon.
It's not my fault.
I forgot to vote.
Crud, I knew there was something
I meant to do today.
<i>Morbo congratulates</i>
<i>our gargantuan cyborg president.</i>
<i>May death come</i> q<i>uickly</i>
<i>to his enemies.</i>
Who's kicking who around now?
Knock knock.

Xmas Story
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Conan O'Brien 's head!</i>
Thank you. Thank you.
Let's get started. Max, play me over.
Someone forgot to feed Max!
So, people are getting pretty worried
about this Y2K problem, huh?
No! They fixed that 900 years ago!
Just bear with me.
I'm walking to work this morning...
I doubt it!
Listen, I may have lost my freakishly
long legs in the War of 2012...
...but I've still got something
you'll never have: A soul!
And freckles!
Well, I'm out of material.
You can catch me next week
at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut.
Enjoy your breakfast!
Let's face it.
Comedy's a dead art form.
Now, tragedy? That's funny.
Come on, everyone.
Perhaps skiing will help us forget
the moldy old antics of Conan O'Brien.
- Great idea!
- We can only hope.
This snow is beautiful.
I'm glad global warming
never happened.
Actually, it did. Thank God,
Nuclear Winter canceled it out.
Enough of your mindless chitchat!
Let's get going!
Damn it. We're stuck!
At least you're not cold-blooded.
Sweet lion of Zion,
look at the professor go!
Look out for those trees!
Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down!
<i>Trees down!</i>
Cool. What if you want the trees up?
<i>Trees up!</i>
- Trees down.
<i>- Trees down.</i>
Looking good, meatball!
Excuse me, sir.
You're snowboarding off the trail.
Lick my frozen metal ass.
- Mommy!
- Help!
You, a bobsledder?
That I'd like to see.
Listen, you filthy crab.
1000 years ago, there was a legendary
team of Jamaican bobsledders.
Yep, I remember.
They came in last at the Olympics and
retired to promote alcoholic drinks.
A true inspiration for the children.
A little help, please?
Oh, what the hell.
You poor man. What happened to you?
Well, I was on the triple-diamond
slope when suddenly...
Oh, excuse me.
Hello, there.
Nothing like a warm fire
and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
Really puts you
in the Christmas spirit.
- What-mas?
- Christmas.
You know, "X-M-A-S. "
You mean Xmas. You must be using
an archaic pronunciation.
Like when you say "ask"
instead of "ax. "
Xmas, huh?
You know, this'll be my first Xmas
away from home.
Let me ax you something.
Would it cheer you up
if we go get an Xmas tree?
Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree.
These aren't Xmas trees!
They're like a pine tree.
Pine trees have been extinct
for 800 years, Fry.
Gone the way of the poodle
and your primitive notions of modesty.
Ah! Brisk.
This isn't the way Christmas
is supposed to be.
- There, there.
- Everything's changed.
That's not true.
<i>Oh Xmas tree</i>
<i>Oh Xmas tree</i>
<i>Bah boo bee boo bah bee bow</i>
Every Christmas, Mom would get a goose
for goose burgers.
Dad would whip up his special eggnog
out of bourbon and ice cubes.
This dumb holiday just makes me think
of all I left behind.
- Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
- Happy Xmas, Xmas people!
Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas!
Amy, there you go. Fry. Professor.
Zoidberg.
A mighty haul for Bender.
Yes, I got the most! I win Xmas!
And last but not least,
the sweet flower of the office:
Me. Hermes Conrad.
Ah, a picture of my mommy.
Huh? What's this?
A card from my cousin Zoidfarb.
Instead of Claus, he writes "Claws. "
Now that's humorous. Today's comedians
could learn from this card.
What's the point of Xmas when everyone
you know died 1000 years ago?
I'm the Ioneliest person on Earth.
Leela, how about a little sympathy?
Yoiks! What was that about?
She's an orphan.
Yes. And the only one of her species
in all the known universe.
What a Ionely life.
My God, poor Leela.
Heard you needed cheering up.
Well, old Bender will make you laugh.
Look at me, look!
Man. I got to work on my act.
I feel like a rat.
I've been whining like a pig
while Leela was Ionely as a frog.
- I could kick myself.
- I'll do it for you.
- Thanks.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
You'd have to be blind not to notice
that Leela's a Cyclops.
Fry's over there, man.
Xmas Eve. Another pointless day
where I accomplish nothing.
<i>The holiday season is a time</i>
<i>of celebration for most.</i>
<i>But it's also a time to remember the</i>
<i>sad suffering of the less fortunate.</i>
<i>Earthlings do not yet know</i>
<i>the meaning of suffering.</i>
<i>Earlier today, I visited a shelter</i>
<i>for down-and-out robots.</i>
<i>Homeless robots, too poor to afford...</i>
<i>... even the basic alcohol they need</i>
<i>to fuel their circuits.</i>
<i>Is there anything sadder?</i>
<i>Only drowning puppies. And there</i>
<i>would have to be a lot of them.</i>
Where you going, Bender?
To volunteer at a liquor kitchen
for homeless robots.
Right. As if you ever did
anything charitable.
I'm very generous.
What about that time I gave blood?
- Whose blood?
- Some guy's.
I've got to do something to show Leela
how sorry I am.
So, what's the problem?
Simply get down on your claws
and do the apology dance.
So it's left, left, right...
Wait! I have a better idea.
I'll go out and get her
the perfect Xmas present.
Something so great
she'll never be unhappy again.
- Just be back by sundown, man.
- We'll see. I like to haggle.
You can't stay out on Xmas Eve.
You'll be killed!
- Say what?
- He doesn't know about Santa Claus!
I know about Santa Claus.
Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot
Company built a robotic Santa...
...to determine who'd been naughty
and who'd been nice...
...and distribute presents
accordingly.
But something went wrong.
Wow. 2801. Anyway...
Wait, you fool!
Due to a programming error,
Santa's standards were set too high...
...and he invariably judges everyone
to be naughty.
If he catches you after dark,
he'll chop off your head...
...and stuff your neck full of toys
from his sack of horrors!
Nice meeting you.
Welcome, brother. May the blessings
of the season be upon you.
I'm one of those lazy homeless bums
I've been hearing about.
Can you point me to the free booze?
I really like this girl but she thinks
I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
There's a suicide booth
in the Food Court.
Though there's a line
this time of year.
No, I need to get her a gift.
And I need it before sundown.
You can't go wrong
with something traditional.
A surface-to-Santa rocket launcher.
Comes with 3 jolly-seeking missiles.
- That's funny.
- Careful, sir.
Oh, yeah. You filthy hobos sure know
how to live.
Hey, chief? Someone's stealing
your handkerchief full of crap.
Excuse me, sir.
Might I have a sip of booze?
I'm sorry, Tinny Tim.
Seems we ran out early tonight.
I understand.
My God, that poor kid.
You're the last store open.
I need something for my friend, Leela.
- Just give me your best animal.
- Best is a matter of opinion.
I personally like the electric snail.
That's a stupid animal. You're stupid.
I said I want the best one.
Which costs more,
the parrot or the lizard?
The lizards are a buck each.
The parrot is $500.
That's a hell of a good parrot.
Although, I could get 500 lizards
for the same price.
Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
Sir, the store is closing
in 2 minutes.
Okay. I'll take the 500 lizards.
No, wait. Yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes!
The parrot!
I spent every penny I had,
but I bet Leela's going to love you.
You're quite the talker,
aren't you?
Shut the hell up!
Stupid bird! I know where you live!
Hey, it's Leela!
Sorry I stormed out before.
I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
You were gone?
I get tired of Fry always
only thinking of himself.
I hear that.
I ax him to set the table. And he goes
out to buy you a present. Selfish dog.
Wait. He's still out?
His life's in danger!
- Why?
- I'm telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town!
All right, bird.
You thought you'd beat me in a game
of wits, but you just met your equal.
Cornered!
- Hi, there.
- Leela? Oh, my God.
You saved my life.
I am going to get you so many lizards.
You didn't need to buy me a present.
I just wanted to make you happy.
I miss my family,
but you never even had a family.
It's okay.
You're Ionely, and I'm Ionely.
But together, we're Ionely together.
- Merry Xmas, Leela.
- Merry Xmas.
Oh, boy! It's Santa!
You've been very naughty,
Fry and Leela. I checked my list.
Well, check it twice.
I perform over 50 mega-checks
per second.
You're both naughty for disregarding
each other's feelings.
But we set things right. Fry even
risked his life to get me a present.
But what about your other co-workers?
Did either of you ever stop to think
about Doctor Zoidberg's feelings?
No, I swear!
Santa has something very special
in his sack for you.
<i>So lock the door and hit the floor</i>
<i>Because Santa Claus comes tonight</i>
- Go away.
- Whoa. Hold on.
What about the traditional glass
of hard cider?
Oh, all right. But just one glass.
Okay, that's enough.
I said, that's enough!
Get her purse!
Let us live! We'll put out
cookies for you!
You dare bribe Santa?
I'll shove coal so far up your
stocking, you'll cough up diamonds!
We're trapped.
I never thought it'd end this way,
gunned down by Santa Claus.
Honestly, I didn't see it coming.
- Goodbye, Fry.
- Goodbye, Leela.
Hey, look. We're under the mistletoe.
Your mistletoe is no match
for my T.O.W. missile.
Your present may need some assembly.
<i>On the fourth day of Xmas</i>
<i>I stole from that lady</i>
<i>Four family photos</i>
<i>Three</i> j<i>ars of pennies</i>
<i>Two former husbands</i>
<i>And a slipper on a shoe tree</i>
Oh, thank you!
- Help!
- Somebody help us!
It's humans!
Shall we mug them, robot, sir?
No, wait. I know these guys.
They got nothing!
You've been very naughty, Bender!
I didn't do nothing.
You're thinking of the kid.
My God, Bender. Framing an orphan?
That's so naughty I'll have to add it
to my list right now.
Framing...
I...
...N...
...G...
Amy, this is for you.
A set of combs
for your beautiful hair.
Oh, that's so sweet.
But I sold my hair to a wigmaker
to buy a set of combs for Hermes.
Oh, the irony.
I sold my hair so I could buy
this third set of combs for Zoidberg.
Thank you.
These'll come in handy
for my new hair.
Finally I look as pretty as I feel.
Help!
Oh, dear, they'll be killed
on our doorstep.
And there's no trash pickup
till January 3rd.
Sweet manatee of Galilee!
He's on the roof!
<i>Q</i>uick! The armor-plated chimney cover!
Push! Push!
Use teamwork!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
You've all been very naughty.
Very naughty, indeed.
Except you, Doctor Zoidberg.
- This is for you.
- A pogo stick.
As for the rest of you, I'll tear off
your skin like wrapping paper...
...and deck the halls with your guts.
Yeah? Well, I don't believe
in Santa Claus.
Come on, everybody. If you don't
believe in him, he can't hurt you.
Oh, God, the pain!
Time to get jolly
on your naughty asses.
Watch out, his belly's shaking
like a bowl full of nitroglycerine.
- Rudolph's nose!
- He's going to blow!
Good thing I got us out of that one.
Xmas dinner, everyone.
Bender, where did you get that bird?
I found it lying in the street,
like all the food I cook.
Dig in, everyone!
- Thank you, sir.
- You got the toenail.
Look, the food isn't what's important.
I'm so hungry.
The important thing is,
we're all together for Xmas.
And even though I'm surrounded by
robots and monsters and old people...
...I've never felt more at home.
Hear, hear! Now, let's all of us
shut up and sing!
<i>He knows when you are sleeping</i>
<i>He knows when you're on the can</i>
<i>He'll hunt you down and blast your ass</i>
<i>From here to Pakistan</i>
<i>You'd better not breathe</i>
<i>You'd better not move</i>
<i>You're better off dead</i>
<i>I'm telling you, dude</i>
<i>Santa Claus is gunning you down</i>
Merry Xmas, everyone!
I'll be back.
Back when you least expect it.
Next Xmas!

<i>Call Robo-Rooter if you flush a towel</i>

<i>Robo-Rooter</i>
Now this is progress:
A self-microwaving Bavarian Cream Dog.
Let's just pray I have the energy
to get another beer.
What is this, the Middle Ages?
Look at you.
- You've become a fat sack of crap.
- Sack?
Bender, your beer belly's so big
your door won't close.
- And that doesn't make sense.
- You're coming to the gym.
The gym? Excellent! Excellent!
For some reason, I'm frisky
as a squid on Tuesday.
Who's up for a steam?
Crustaceans don't like steam.
I'll work out with the Nautilus.
- What up, Dr. Z?
- Yo, yo. What's up? Give up the rock!
Co-ed steam rooms. I love the future.
You're in the women's steam room.
Ah, futuristic.
Look what life was like
before genetic engineering.
The poor 20th-century women.
Hey, handsome. Have room for two?
You wish.
Hey, Leela, look who's the super stud.
Someone must have
turned down the gravity.
Give me that!
More weight!
What's that jazz on your head?
Enough questions. More weight!
More!
More!
Maybe you could
do more reps with less weight.
Looks like Zoidberg's finally
coming out of his shell! Get it?
He's coming out...
Nice and gentle. We don't want
any unnecessary stress.
- Is there a doctor in the gym?
- I'm a doctor!
Why's he acting this way?
- He seemed the most normal.
- I am normal.
Amy, take off these rubber bands
and I'll show you.
Fool me seven times, shame on you.
Fool me eight times, shame on me.
- Maybe he has a parasite.
- Maybe he is one.
It's sad when a friend goes nuts...
...and you have to have a clambake
and cook him.
This won't do.
Let me give old Zoidie a sedative.
- Much better. You can remove these.
- I'll do it.
- Look out!
- Moron!
There's the problem.
Give it to me straight. Is it fin rot?
It's fin rot, isn't it?
Relax, chum. It's no problem.
You're just heavy with male jelly.
Blech!
It's mating season for his people.
A time when his behavior
is run by the brain in his rump.
- There's one thing we can do.
- I'll boil the water.
We, I mean you, have to rush him
to his ancient home world...
...which will soon erupt in an orgy
of invertebrate sex.
- Oh, baby, I'm there!
- Do you understand "invertebrate"?
It's not the word I care about.
No need to pack pants. Let's roll!
Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these.
Moron!
Welcome home, old friend!
Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!
- Excellent! Excellent!
- See ya there, Doctor...
That's how you say "Zoidberg"?
You didn't have to point out
his speech impediment.
- You're looking less nuts.
- I'm feeling less nuts.
Tomorrow I'll be depositing jelly
in the cloacal vents of a female.
Catch my drift?
- Who's the lobsterina?
- Not sure.
I shall attract one today
with an erotic display.
Your people fall in love so fast.
"Love"? That word's unknown here.
I want a female swollen with eggs
to accept my genetic material.
You and me both.
Ah! My old scuttling grounds.
Let's pull over.
I used to hang out here as a larva.
It looked much bigger then.
Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?
Look! Outdoor theater!
Let's get tickets!
It's the Ceremony of Claw Plock.
We fight to the death over honor...
...and whether abbreviations count
in Scrabble. They don't!
I didn't come to see two guys.
Where do you do your erotic display?
Same as your species. The beach!
- How do I look?
- Like whale barf.
Then the illusion is complete.
I wonder if they're here to watch
the erotic display too.
Perfect. This ought
to make me stand out.
- Look how silly they look.
- He's no different from you organisms...
...shooting DNA at each other
to make babies.
It's offensive!
Keep your jelly away from my eggs.
So not interested.
I've heard that before.
What's the point?
Why's he still alone?
He's a loser, that's why.
The lobster equivalent of Fry.
I can get any girl, any time.
I'm just too busy.
Edna!
Edna, it's me, Zoidberg.
Remember? From high school.
My face was covered with barnacles.
I didn't know you were back in town.
I heard you became a rich doctor.
I've performed a few mercy killings.
So, as long as I'm in town,
I was wondering if maybe, well...
Gee. Yeah, I'm just going through
a lot of things right now, and...
Look, I carry more eggs
than other females.
I owe it to our race to pick a mate
stuffed with jelly.
- Maybe a rock star.
- Or a doctor?
I'm sorry. You're just an inferior
male specimen.
Nice seeing you again.
No one will ever mate with me.
Not with a puny claw like this.
Did you see those guys?
They were giant claws with bodies.
- You didn't smell as bad.
- You're right.
My stink gland is weak. Smell!
You gotta fake like you're in love.
Look in her eyes, start crying...
...and say, "I've never been so happy. "
If a guy ever did that, I'd know it.
Wait a second. They've all done that.
Even Sean!
This "love" intrigues me.
Teach me to fake it!
You're on a date.
What do you do?
- Ask her to mate.
- Say she's special.
She's not. She just has
the largest clutch of eggs.
- Well, tell her that. Then?
- Then mating.
No. Make up feelings
and tell her you have them.
- Is "desire to mate" a feeling?
- You're not even trying!
It's all so complicated.
The romance and the lies upon lies.
Don't worry. The love meister
will take you under his wing.
Now there's a bird involved?
Okay, go ahead.
What the... Dr. Zoidberg?
Your display failed.
Why are you trying to talk to me?
I don't know.
You just want to talk.
I just want to talk.
That doesn't make sense.
That doesn't make sense. But okay.
Tell her she looks thin.
You seem malnourished.
Do you suffer from parasites?
Yes. Thanks for noticing.
- Ask about her day.
- Why would I care?
- You wouldn't. Ask.
- How was your day?
Well, first I got up
and had a piece of toast.
Then I went to the store. And...
Look, she won't shut up.
It's normal.
Just nod and say, "Uh-huh. "
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- And then you threw an octopus.
It's crazy,
but when you talk this way...
...your obvious deficiencies seem
less obvious.
Your genes seem less detrimental.
You even stink more.
- Ask to mate?
- Third date.
So I returned his artificial heart.
Since then,
I've been called "Honest Bender. "
"I'd like to propose a toast to
coat check number 84. "
- Turn it over.
- Oh. "Edna!
Of all the gross crab monsters
on this planet...
...you are the hottest. "
Oi.
- That's the most beautiful thing.
- Yes. Well...
...excuse me. I must powder my flaps.
Me too.
I'm confused. I'm feeling a strange
new emotion.
Is it love when you care for a female
for reasons beyond mating?
No. Must be some alien emotion.
He said some dumb stuff.
He's a nice guy. Really.
Fry's been telling him what
to say. And Fry's a...
- Do you have idiots on your planet?
- Fry?
Words of such beauty came from
the blowhole of that hideous alien?
Yeah. What?
Look, never mind the words.
Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey.
Come in.
Hello, Fry.
Can I interest you in some
surf and turf?
I came to tell you that Zoidberg's
great. He's got jelly out the wazoo.
That is where it comes out.
It's not everything.
I know Zoidberg's words were yours.
Teach me to love,
you squishy poet from beyond!
I'm flattered. If I did it
with a mudbug, you'd top the list.
Hush, you romantic fool.
Engage your mandibles and kiss me.
Edna? I couldn't stand
it any longer. I...
Fry!
It's not how it looks!
- Her caviar is on your neck!
- But...
It's true, Zoidberg.
We can't hide it any longer.
We're in love,
and we're mating tomorrow!
- What?!
- Fry! I challenge you to Claw Plock!
- English, please?
- A fight to the death!
And if you survive,
we'll make sweet love.
The law is clear.
Fry and Zoidberg shall fight
to the death for the beautiful Edna.
But I don't want her!
The tradition of Claw Plock
can't be taken back.
It is a recent tradition, only
18 years old, but it is a tradition.
I'm going to rip your swim bladder
out and show it to you!
This is madness!
You're being irrational!
Of course I'm being irrational!
I'm in love!
- Leela!
- Right, right.
You have to stop this.
Listen, lady. As you can see...
...I'm a highly desirable male
groaning with jelly.
Yet I embrace celibacy
to uphold our crazy traditions.
- One of your friends must die.
- Fate is cruel and unyielding.
And what must be, must be.
Taking bets! 9-to-2 on Zoidberg,
the crab with the jab!
The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!
It's been years since medical school.
Remind me:
- Disemboweling you, fatal or not?
- Fatal.
Large bet on me in round one!
Have you anything to say
before begins the Claw Plock?
I do. Today I got up
and I had a piece of toast...
...then I brushed my teeth...
- Shut up!
- I love you, Fry!
No!
Having guessed what animal
I was thinking of...
...you have first choice of weapon.
- And you, doctor?
- I choose my claws.
I want to chop him here,
in the gonads.
Nobody correct him.
Fry, I've never asked
for anything before...
When it comes to the ninth round,
let him win.
- It's a fight to the death!
- Suddenly it's all about you! Sheesh.
Please rise for the national anthem.
Uh-oh.
Let Claw Plock begin!
Go, Fry! Die with dignity!
Oops!
No! I can't stand to look!
What?
Fry! Take a dive!
Claw Plock! Claw Plock!
Claw Plock! Claw Plock! Claw Plock!
Fellow fish monsters, I don't want
to question your stupid civilization...
...but will killing someone
with a nutcracker solve anything?
He's my friend. Though a woman
has come between us...
...we'll remain friends.
And do you know why? One reason.
You bastard! I'll kill you!
You bastard!
Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone!
Edna? Honey?
Edna?
Oh, my God!
The frenzy!
Oh, the greatest experience
in life and I missed it.
I'm sorry, doc.
The frenzy is over.
How will I get rid of my jelly now?
- I'll lend you this.
- Fry.
- Hey!
- Shoo! Get away, hey!
What's with the flying jerks?
They feast after the frenzy.
Once my species passes
its genes, it dies.
You choose between
life without sex and death?
- Yes.
- Tough call.
It was nice of you
to let me fix your arm.
Especially after I made
an eel out of myself.
- No biggie.
- Yes, biggie.
I felt things I never felt before.
Love, jealousy,
passion for disemboweling.
I owe it all to you.
I pronounce the operation a success.
- Hooray!
- Yeah!
I don't know emotions.
But medicine, forget about it.
Not to nitpick, doc, but could
you take one more whack at this?
For you, my friend, anything.
<i>- My legs!</i>
<i>- All right...</i>
<i>Third time's the charm.</i>

Put Your Head on My Shoulders
Four score and 1145 years ago...
...our forefathers' foreheads
conceived a new nation.
This Presidents' Day, we honor the
values my body fought and died for.
Values like this new Plymouth V'ger.
I'm Malfunctioning Eddie...
...and I'm malfunctioning so badly,
I'm giving these cars away!
Let's go car shopping! My parents said
if I got B's, they'd buy me a bar.
I got all C's!
Mind if I tag along?
My ass needs servicing.
This says it could catch fire
in a collision.
No wonder you're
at the end of conga lines.
I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.
I'm Victor, and I know many things
about the art of unloading fine cars...
...on beautiful women.
Now tell us she's witty
and sophisticated.
A gentleman always
sells a lady a car first.
This is a Beta Romeo.
Yes, the Beta Romeo.
Note the cross-your-heart seat belt.
It protects, lifts and separates.
Spotted her when you walked in, huh?
She's a beauty.
Yeah, beautiful coffee.
No, the Ford Thunder
Cougar Falcon Bird!
Nothing makes you feel
more like a man.
- How much do you want to spend?
- I'm not buying.
I see you don't care if people
question your sexual orientation.
I do, but I don't know how
to make them stop!
Thunder Cougar Falcon Bird.
The seats are stuffed
with eagle down...
...the dash inlaid
with beaks of eagles.
There are eagles
under the floorboards.
- That's an awful lot of eagle.
- Yes. And yet...
- What's wrong?
- The luxury edition has more eagle.
- It's sad to think you're missing out.
- Oh, don't be sad.
My parents are paying
and they're incredibly rich.
I installed bumpers to reduce
the risk of butt failure.
You, sir, have defaced
a national treasure!
I demand you restore my buttocks
to their former glory!
All right, but that ass is gonna blow,
and when it does...
...I pray you're not mooning
someone you care about.
This car has everything
a beautiful woman like me needs.
Victor said so.
No dog food for Victor tonight!
The sticker says $55,000.
But we'll only go as high as, say...
Sixty thousand!
I'll have to ask my manager.
- You don't go above the sticker price.
- I thought it was an auction.
- He is not too happy.
- I'm sorry. Eighty thousand?
I'm terrible at parallel parking.
You're asking for a day off?
Get out of my sight!
You're bogarting my patience.
Who were you yelling at?
I asked me for Valentine's Day off.
I was in no mood for my shenanigans.
Valentine's Day's coming?
I forgot to get a girlfriend again.
- Since we have no dates, we should...
- You assume I can't get a date?
How about 8:00?
I'm taking my new car to Mercury.
Wanna come?
- Okay. How's the weather?
- The usual. Boiling lead, lava.
So, what? Shorts?
Boy, this a/c is incredible.
I better turn on the heater too.
This heater is incredible!
I better turn up the a/c some more.
- How about some icy margaritas?
- Yeah!
- We're slowing down!
- I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
Who wants Pop-Tarts?
It's okay. I have an emergency phone.
- What are you doing?
- It's a videophone.
I'm in the Astro-Afro-
Antarctico-Amerasian Auto Association.
Hello? Septuple A?
It'll be a couple hours.
Oh, I'm gonna get sweat
on my sweat suit.
You're rich. How come you dress
like you're doing your laundry?
My parents tell me
to be more ladylike. As though.
My folks were always on me to wear
underpants. What am I, the pope?
If you were, they'd be all,
"Straighten your pope hat"...
...and "Put on your good vestments. "
It's nice to find someone
I can talk to about stuff, and junk.
It's like we feel the same way
about junk and stuff, or whatever.
- While they tow us, you wanna do it?
- Yeah!
Which concludes the summary
of the movie I saw.
- Any old business?
- No.
- Any new business?
- No.
- Anyone sleep together?
- No.
- Yep.
- Kind of.
- What?
- Oh, my God!
- One thing led to another.
- It led there again when we got home.
You snagged the perfect girlfriend.
Amy's rich, she's probably
got other characteristics...
Bender, romance isn't about money.
It's coincidence that Zoidberg is
desperately poor and miserably Ionely?
Please!
For your information,
it's because he's hideous.
They go together like
a lime and a coconut.
- Do I hear wedding bells?
- What? No!
Really? Oh, dear.
You're both very lucky. I'd pay
to end my miserable Ioneliness.
If I weren't so desperately poor.
People will pay good money
for romance?
I have a scheme
so deviously clever that I...
- $500 and time served.
- Stupid anti-pimping laws.
Well, pay the man!
- Honey, we love you!
- Shut up, baby, I know it!
Computer dating. Like pimping,
but you rarely say "upside your head. "
- Why would anyone ask you for help?
- Don't make me go upside your head!
Fry? Amy? Put your pants back on!
I need a stapler!
If you disrupt the mating dance...
...the male will maul us
with his fearsome gonad.
It's working.
They think we're making out.
- Why aren't we making out?
- I don't know.
- Okay, Mister...?
- Smith. Zapp Smith. Brannigan.
Check off what you look for
in a mate.
Let's see. Oh, yes. Yes, definitely.
I'd like some of that.
I'll just have everything on the menu.
I'll run it through our high-speed
Romance-A-Logical Datafier.
- Say hello to Miss Right.
- Hello.
Wow, we're great kissers.
Hey, later you want
to drive out to Europa?
We can picnic and spit at Jupiter.
I used to spit at stuff
in the 20th century.
Cool how we think alike, and junk.
Yeah. You know, Fry,
I like hanging out with you.
It was great. But now she's talking
about hanging out.
She's getting way too serious.
I'm not a one-woman man, Leela.
- You'll be back to zero soon.
- She's smothering me.
- Hi.
- You see? She's bothering me at work!
I do my job, there's Amy.
I go to the candy machine,
there's Amy.
I sleep with Amy, there's Amy.
- I think you're overreacting.
- Am I? Am I?!
Face it, I'm a prize catch.
I'm pulling down delivery boy money.
- She has billions in a trust fund.
- She wants a trophy husband.
Come to Europa with us.
We can't be alone.
Ready for a picnic, just you and me?
You know who loves picnics
with just you and me?
Dr. Zoidberg.
Did someone say something
about a free meal?
I haven't eaten since Tuesday.
Bird eggs. Animal slices.
Dry woven reeds.
All gone. Can I drive?
No. Fry, you busy tomorrow?
I got tickets to the ape fight.
We'll spend Valentine's Day
together, isn't it enough?
Sure. What do you want
to do for Valentine's Day?
- Now we're doing Valentine's Day?
- You said...
We have to talk! Zoidberg, you drive!
Pardon me. Excuse me.
I'll just turn the wheel
to maximum fastness.
You know how you like chocolate
but get tired of it...
...when it always
wants to hang out?
- You don't like chocolate?
- Can chocolate let me finish?
And the winner of the big car race is
Hot Rod Zoidberg!
What I'm trying to say is,
I think we should stop...
Here, you drive.
Fry? Are you all right?
My head's killing me.
What happened? Was anyone hurt?
No, no, no. Of course not.
Nobody but you.
Your body was badly damaged
in the crash.
- How badly?
- That's it over there.
I managed to keep your head
alive with some quick surgery.
- Where is it?
- There.
Looks like we'll be spending
a lot more time together, Fry.
This always happens
with office romances.
We'll have your body
all fixed up in a few days.
Upsy-daisy.
I'll try not to interfere
in your life.
- Fry?
- Sorry. I guess I control that arm.
What'd you want to talk about, anyway?
Maybe we'd better talk in private.
I'll meet you in the closet.
I like you as a friend. But we're
spending too much time together.
- You're breaking up with me?
- We should see other people.
I was really having fun.
If that's how you feel.
I'm sorry, but it is.
If we're not seeing each other, can I
get another date for Valentine's Day?
- Unless it would make you feel bad.
- Hey, I can get a date too.
I can attract all sorts of women.
With my body, I think
you'll only attract one sort of woman.
So, how's business?
Are you familiar
with my friend Al Gore?
Losers get really desperate
around Valentine's Day.
Yeah, it's pathetic, all right.
- How much?
- Five hundred bucks.
- Done.
- Brannigan okay?
- No!
- Six hundred.
Leela? Can I talk to you
for a minute in private?
No problem.
Amy made Valentine's plans
with some goon...
...and I'm gonna be stuck there.
Will you be my date? Please?
Too late, I'm sharing Valentine's
with a special man.
Not Zapp Brannigan.
Then I have to do something
so pitiful that I'm ashamed to tell.
- Bender's in his office.
- Thanks.
I got your hookup. My fee's 500 bucks,
but seeing how it's you...
...I'll need it in advance.
Okay, we're done with the bra.
Why did you shave? Expecting
something to happen with the date?
- None of your business.
- And that's a lot of makeup.
- It's deodorant.
- What does it do?
Come in, Gary.
I'll just be another 20 minutes!
I'll be waiting!
20 minutes? You're ready now!
- It's good to make them wait a little.
- Oh, God, it's true!
- That dress looks great on you.
- Thanks.
Where is she?
I must say, Amy, you're all made up.
Just like Fry's date. Get it?
I've got a date. She's coming.
Fry, look who I found!
It's Petunia, your dream girl!
How's them eats?
Don't mind if I do.
- Kids will be hungry.
- She seems old.
She's well-traveled.
I don't mean she travels.
- Wheels fell off my house.
- Rose? Five bucks.
I'll take one.
- Me too.
- Eight bucks.
- You said...
- Demand skyrocketed. You all saw it.
Leela, meet your future husband, Sal.
- Nice eyeball, Eyeball.
- Nice ass, Ass.
Sparks! Buy her a rose,
I promise she'll put out.
I'll take my chances.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Tell me, you a good gambler?
- Well, I...
- What's your game? Bingo? Keno?
You don't have your own body!
- I control this arm.
- Slots player?
- Sorry, but I can do better.
- Wait! Come back, darling!
I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley.
I'd kiss you but I lost my teeth.
I'd love to take a whack at you...
...but the 10: 15 to Nutley
ain't going without me driving.
Excuse me, did you say
" 10: 15 to Nutley"?
Why, yes I did.
Did you round up our dates
at the bus station?
- Of course not.
- Anybody else for Nutley?
Wait, you didn't
show me your surprise!
- You know what I'd like to do...
- Oh, jeez, get a room.
Maybe later.
I have an idea!
Let's go out for ice cream.
I thought Amy could come
to my place for coffee.
- I don't like coffee.
- Neither do I.
I feel a little tipsy.
Let me pick up the check.
No!
That's it! I'm getting out of here!
If it isn't my favorite head
on Amy's body: Fry!
- Oh, Leela.
- We were just on our way out.
Nonsense. The evening's young.
So, Gary, what do you do for a living?
Banking industry regulator.
Really? I heard that banking industry
regulations are very simple.
That's not true.
Modern banking regulations are a
product of five regulatory traditions.
- Six, if you want to get technical.
- Oh, I do.
It began in 1410, when a number
of noblemen convened with the...
Thank you.
There, good as new.
Except your dorsal fin.
I couldn't find it after the crash.
- I'll live without it?
- You call that living?
Why wouldn't you let me graft
a laser cannon on your chest?
To crush those who disobey you.
I guess we're two different people.
Thanks for the ride, Amy. No hard
feelings about your date, or stuff.
I had fun. If I ever feel Ionely...
...I'll look at this disfiguring scar
and think of you.
Anyway, it's nice to have
my own body back.
How's the corpse? Hooked up okay?
Seems to be. My neck's
just a little tender.
Cool! Ow!
Thanks for rescuing me last night.
Anytime. I enjoyed hanging out.
Everything worked out great,
thanks to Bender.
It's not like you
set us up with bad dates...
...just so we'd be together.
Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
No! You just corralled some stiffs
at the bus station and took our money.
True. But in the end, isn't that what
Valentine's Day is all about?
- Yeah.
- I guess so.
Watch the neck!
My ass! My beautiful...

But Bender, you are a...

I direct your attention

Which has yet to be deciphered.
- Do you know?
- Yes. A cop told me.
It means, "Up yours. "
I'm really enjoying the day out
with you people.
Hey, a suicide booth!
So long, suckers!
Sorry, Bender,
that's just a phone booth.
- What were they used for?
- In New York? Bathrooms.
I'll be out in a second.
"Tokens only. "
How does this work?
I'll show you.
It's a turnstile.
What's this?
- Another bathroom?
- It's a mobile apartment with no rent.
Come on, Fry, get up!

Actually, she wasn't my girlfriend...

Didn't I tell you to end
your stories a sentence earlier?
Let's sneak in for a closer look.
We don't touch the antiques, sir.
I'm sorry. You work here.
I should have known from that getup.
This is from Miller's Outpo...
I mean, yeah, I work here all right.
Move this rust bucket out behind
Saint Koch's cathedral.
Did you drive much, Fry?
No one in New York drove.
There was too much traffic.
Nice.
Listen to that baby purr.
There's a baby in there, huh?
It's just like riding a bicy...
- I think I got whiplash.
- How? You don't have a neck.
I meant ass whiplash.
I'm glad we hit something.
I thought we'd never stop.
I think I got whiplash.
How's that robot I hit?
We did all we could.
- You mean he's...
- Good as new? Yes!
Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you,
this is Flexo.
Except for that stylish beard,
he looks just like Bender!
No duh! We're both bending units.
What's your serial number?
3370318.
No way! Mine's 2716057.
- I don't get it.
- We're both the sum of two cubes.
Sorry about crushing your body, Flexo.
You okay now?
Well, I don't feel as bad as you look.
I'm just messing with you.
You're okay.
That's some face you've got.
There's a cream for that.
- No. You're great.
- Is there anything I can do for you?
Your stunt did a number on my back.
You mind rubbing it for me?
Sure.
That's it.
A little lower.
- How's that?
- Lower.
- That's it. A little lower, though.
- I can't get any lower.
I'll say.
You're rubbing my ass!
Check it out.
Six beautiful devices.
They know what you like, and they
do it to within one micron.
- Spin those fans, baby.
- Yeah, baby!
All right, mama!
- Spin it, baby.
- Gyrate it, honey!
I don't like this place.
It's 120 with little oxygen.
Shut up and hoot.
- Yeah!
- All right!
Hubba-hubba! She is built!
In Mexico, I believe.
And that ain't silicon.
It's tungsten, and plenty of it.
Yeah.
Look at that exhaust fan.
- Pervert.
- Yoo-hoo...
Thanks, moderate spender.
Select erotic transaction.
How about a lap dance
for my pal here?
No.
That's all right. Really.
There's something about Flexo
I don't like.
Hey, Fry? Think fast!
Get it? It's chlorine!
- It's funny because it's poisonous.
- Keep laughing, shrimp.
He's bad news.
I regret hitting him.
Take a rage dump.
He's no worse than Bender.
He is. He drinks, smokes
and posts naked photos of me.
- That's Bender.
- I'm talking about Flexo.
I get it. This is cute.
You're jealous of Bender's new friend.
No, I'm not! Mark my words:
Flexo's evil.
He's the evil Bender.
Rage dump.
Good news, everyone. Report to
my bedroom for a private exhibition.
Everyone, get in bed with me.
I have something to show you.
Feast your eyes...
...on this!
It's beautiful!
And huge!
Can I touch it?
What is it, already?
It's a single atom of Jumbonium.
An element so rare the nucleus alone
is worth more than $50,000.
- How much more?
- 100,000.
That's why I hid it
under my mattress.
Can we discuss this somewhere else?
Why certainly.
The atom sits atop
this dime-store tiara...
...to be awarded to the winner
of the Miss Universe Pageant.
Your job is to deliver it,
safe and sound.
When I was a little girl,
I dreamed of being Miss Universe.
That's pathetic.
Deep down,
all girls wanna be Miss Universe.
- Not me.
- Really?
Maybe it's just cute girls.
The atom's value would bankrupt
Planet Express, if it were stolen.
We'll need to hire additional security
for the mission.
Mister Professor, right here!
We should stick with people we know.
- Flexo's great, but...
- Flexo's great?
That's good enough for me.
Welcome aboard, lad.
Space <i>bandidos</i> are operating nearby.
You'll take eight-hour guard shifts.
Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
Wait. Hold on.
Let's go alphabetically.
Okay. Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
Go by rank.
Okay. Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
Flexo outranks me?
That's "Flexo outranks me, sir! "
- Who goes there?
- Don't point that at me.
I know Flexo's your friend,
but I don't trust him.
Just because he has a beard
you label him as evil?
I've got a label for you,
an ugly word called "prejudice. "
- I'm not prejudiced.
- Save it for the cross burning, Adolf!
- Keeping an eye on the safe?
- You know it!
Looks like it's my shift.
Lie down and go off-line for a while.
All right.
Caught you!
You were looking at the atom.
So? I look at lots of atoms.
- Shouldn't you rest up for your shift?
- You'd like me to fall asleep.
Whatever it takes to shut your yapper.
I'm just kidding you.
Here's a joke:
I'm gonna sit here until my shift.
- Suit yourself, skinbag.
- I will.
- Good!
- Good!
Good!
That's eight hours.
Eight hours of solid boredom.
I'm kidding.
You're a wonderful man.
Finally, the atom is safe.
What is it?
My God!
Did you hear maracas?
- No.
- It wasn't space <i>bandidos.</i>
Lock the ship.
- Don't let Flexo escape.
- Aye, aye.
It appears Flexo has outwitted us all.
Especially me...
...Bender.
How did he steal the atom?
By using a sleep ray.
Sleep rays exist, right?
- No.
- Then I fell asleep.
You were sure right about Flexo.
The ship's locked.
He may have escaped.
Thanks, Bender.
Let's look for him.
I've got a map of the ship right here.
Keep an eye on Fry.
It's possible that he did it.
Searching...
Why are you looking for Flexo
in my underpants?
He wasn't here 10 minutes ago,
so I thought I'd check again.
Well, he wasn't in the kitchen room.
Bender, can I hold that map
for a second?
And leave me high and dry in case
of a scavenger hunt? No way.
Give it up!
All right, take it!
Looks like Flexo got away clean.
It's a darn shame.
He must have jumped ship
just as we landed.
Or maybe he never left at all!
Wait. You're Bender.
Who said I wasn't?
Why were you wearing a scarf,
a turtleneck and this?
It's a little thing called style.
Look it up sometime.
Our ninth finalist,
Miss Methane Planet...
...Halatina Smogmeyer.
And our tenth and final finalist,
Miss Earth's Moon...
...the Crush-A-Nator.
Thank you, Bob Barker.
I'm as happy as a girl can be.
End statement.
Which one of these lovely womanoids
will take home the atomic tiara?
Downplay the tiara.
We'll find out after these
subliminal messages.
You lost the atom, huh?
You're garbage! Human garbage!
Do you space jockeys have any idea
how much it's worth?
- $ 100,000?
- $200,000?
- $200,001?
- You're closest without going over.
We'll leave. Just sign,
saying you received the atom.
I'm not signing squat.
Find me that damn tiara.
- But, Mr. Barker...
- Enough!
I may be against the fur industry,
but I'll skin you alive!
As long as no one wears the skin.
Well, gentlemen,
it appears we're boned.
- Flexo!
- Get him!
Next, in what is generously called
the talent competition...
...performing a traditional
gangster rap, Miss...
What the...?
Got you!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Shoot him, he's choking me!
- No. Shoot him, he's choking me!
- I don't know which one to shoot!
- Shoot Flexo!
Women only room!
All right, enough of this!
There's the atom!
Bender? You stole the atom?
Yeah, but I can explain:
It's very valuable.
I saw him snatch it while Fry slept.
That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.
Wait a second.
Bender is the evil Bender?
I am shocked! Shocked!
Well, not that shocked.
I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo.
But with the beard...
Don't even bother!
You people sicken me!
I put my life on the line.
This is how you repay me?
You can go rot for all I care!
I'm just kidding.
You guys are all right.
I'm so confused.
The Bender I like is evil,
and the Bender I hate is good.
How can I live my life
and not tell good from evil?
They're both fine choices.
Whatever floats your boat.
- Is this the guy?
- Huh? Yeah.
It looks like him.
- Wait, but I...
- Take him away.
Let's put an end
to this pathetic hoedown.
Brannigan?
And the winner is...
Who else but Zapp Brannigan...
...would be judging the most
chauvinistic, degrading...
Leela?
Wait, you're making a...
Look at that!
I feel like a princess!
Are you people idiots?
I'm still going <i>mano a mano</i>
with this envelope.
And the winner is...
...Miss Vega 4!
<i>There it is...</i>
<i>... Miss Universe</i>
<i>There it is...</i>
<i>... looking weird</i>
I almost had that tiara.
Me too.
You guys are losers...
...but I made out with the woman
from the Radiator Planet.
Fry, that's a radiator.
Is there a burn ward nearby?

Raging Bender
Good news, everyone!
I've taught the toaster to feel love.
Hermes returns from
his vacation today.
- Good morning.
- Hey, Hermes!
- Yo!
- My man!
- So how was it?
- Stopover on the Brain Slug planet.
Hermes liked it so much
he decided to stay.
Hermes has all the fun.
He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
- You're gonna get us assimilated.
- Switch to a garlic shampoo.
Today's mission is to go
to the Brain Slug planet.
- What'll we do?
- Walk around not wearing a helmet.
Sounds great, Hermes!
Whatever you say.
- Let's ditch him and go to the movies.
- Hey, yeah! Good idea.
I'm seeing a movie with friends.
Cool, let's see this one.
No. I'm not in the mood
for a documentary.
I've heard good things about
<i>Quizblorg, Quizblorg.</i>
I hate subtitles.
Alien films are so pretentious.
Fellows! How about a film we
can all enjoy? <i>Planet of the Clams.</i>
About an upside-down world
where lobster is slave to clam.
Who invited you?
Let's see <i>All My Circuits.</i>
I wanna see that.
Good point, Bender!
- A small slurm.
- For 25 cents less, get a super small.
Okay.
Oh, man!
Give me a large diet malt liquor
and a popcorn with extra motor oil.
Down in front!
<i>Glagnar's Human Rinds presents:</i>
This Week in the Universe.
- This is real futuristic.
- Don't talk during the movie.

<i>I'm almost positive you did.</i>
<i>Add in the carryover from form</i>
<i>16-A, then deduct line 2-B.</i>
Pardon me, sir.
But you seem to be kicking my seat.
"Pardon me, sir.
But you seem to be..."
That's the gist of what I said.
Would you mind?
Sure thing, pal.
Sir?
- Who threw that?
- That's it!
Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs.
Oh, I'm boned.
Let's all go to the lobby!
I'm gonna open a pile of
whup-ass on you!
Do you know who that was?
Cripes! The Masked Unit!
You knocked him out cold!
Wow, I'm impressed!
I'm the commissioner
of Robot Fighting.
A connoisseur of jerks who pick
fights. And you're the biggest.
- You should see me at funerals.
- I want you in the League.
Ultimate Robot Fighting?
Sounds pleasant. I'll do it.
My hero!
They don't make movies
like this anymore.
I'm gonna be the greatest
robot fighter ever!
Float like a float-bot,
sting like a stinging machine!
You can't be a robot fighter. It's
the most brutal form of competition.
- It is?
- There are no rules.
Two robots enter,
one robot leaves.
The other leaves after being
declared the winner.
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- Did I mention the crippling pain?
I'm pretty sure I did.
Yes, definitely.
Crippling? That's not covered by
my insurance. Count me out.
You've got to do it.
I don't care how suicidal it is.
How come when I want to have fun
you're against it?
This is more important than that
marble-eating contest.
- Let me tell you a story.
- Oh, again with the orphanarium.
When I was growing up,
I got picked on a lot.
My only outlet was
Octouran Kung Fu.
Excellent. Bill, Keith,
you will go to championships.
Bill, congratulate Keith
when he wakes up.
But I can beat these dorks
with one eye closed.
Perhaps. There is more
to winning than that.
- You lack the will of a warrior.
- What do you mean? Watch this.
No girl has the will of a warrior.
You have the will of a housewife.
- At best, the schoolmarm.
- I'll take you on right now.
But I have the will of the warrior.
Therefore, the battle is over.
The winner?
Me!
Rematch? You lose again!
Had enough? I thought so!
I lost my chance.
I won't let you throw away yours.
She's right.
I don't want to end up like her!
Count me back in!
Let's see what you got.
Touch your toes.
Still can't reach!
Let's commence preparations
for rumbling!
Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars!
Welcome to tonight's main event.
From Mom's Friendly Robot Factory
in America's heartland, Mexico:
Bender!
And in this corner,
from and made of parts unknown:
The Clear Cutter!
- Bender rules!
- I got you a Bender hat.
Wow! Thanks, Hermes!
I... Hey, cut that out!
You can't hit what you can't see.
Get up. You can't quit every time
you get an ax in the back.
Or a drill through your face. <i>Q</i>uit
scratching your ax-hole and get back.
And the winner is...
Bender!
- Nice work out there, kid.
- He might be dead. I took a life!
Hi, boss. Yo, dude.
He's not dead!
What's up?
You didn't read the pamphlet?
Ultimate Robot Fighting is a scam.
Keep it under your head. But the most
popular robot always wins.
I'm not a great fighter?
I won because I'm popular?
- Bingo.
- Whoo-hoo, I'm popular!
You're pure lowest
common denominator.
Go Bender! Go Bender!
Go Bender!
Presenting Bender...
...The Offender!
I'm just an ex-con trying to go
straight and get my kids back.
Versus...
...Billionaire Bot!
Versus...
...The Foreigner!
I'm not from here!
I have my own customs!
Look at my crazy passport!
Versus...
...The Chain Smoker!
I love smoking.
And after I win the fight...
...I'm headed straight to your
favorite restaurant.
You know, I'm also
an Ultimate Robot Lover.
You're three hours late.
You can't give up.
Both of us worked so hard.
- "We"?
- I said "us. "
Bender The Offender doesn't need you!
He doesn't need anybody.
- What about us, Mr. The Offender?
- Well, I need floozies. Let's roll.
Howdy, chief. What do you say I fight
these two bimbos in some mud?
We're going in a
different direction.
We wouldn't be fighting
in the conventional sense.
You're slipping.
Sales of Bender Brand
bath soaps are down 20 percent.
Those morons!
I said peaberry, not sandalwood!
If you can't move sandalwood,
you don't belong here!
- You'll lose next week's title match.
- But the crowd loves me.
Let's see how they feel
about your new persona.
- The Gender Bender!
- The most unpopular fighter...
...since Sergeant Feces Processor.
Oh, yeah?
What if I don't let the new guy win?
Then he'll just beat you the
old-fashioned way: To death!
Melissa, send in the new kid.
I am Destructor.
See you at the fight.
I said, "See you at the fight. "
And that's the story.
I thought it was real,
like pro wrestling.
But it's fixed, like boxing.
It's one thing to win a fixed fight.
There's dignity. But to lose?
And in this atrocity?
I can't do it.
You've gotta train me to win.
No! You wouldn't take my help
when you didn't need it...
...so why now?
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. But I'm not helping.
<i>You loved him as</i>
<i>Bender The Offender!</i>
<i>Get ready to hate him</i>
<i>as he threatens your sexuality...</i>
<i>... in his new persona:</i>
<i>The Gender Bender!</i>
<i>I'm a real toughie.</i>
<i>S</i>q<i>uaring off this Sunday</i>
<i>versus Destructor!</i>
<i>I will destroy you!</i>
<i>And stop calling me.</i>
<i>I am his trainer,</i>
<i>Master Funog.</i>
<i>He will be victorious for</i>
<i>he has the will of a warrior.</i>
Not Funog!
Let's hit the gym.
I'll teach you to fight like a girl!
I'll put on my tutu.
<i>Hello, and welcome to a remarkable</i>
<i>championship bout.</i>
<i>Destructor, a robotic armored tank...</i>
<i>... whose very use at battle has been</i>
<i>ruled a war crime...</i>
<i>... versus Gender Bender,</i>
<i>who wears a pink tutu.</i>
This is Rich Little imitating
Howard Cosell, here at ringside...
...with George Foreman.
George, a word in edgewise?
This could be the most
one-sided fight since 1973...
...when Ali faced an 80-foot tall
Joe Frazier.
My memory is not so good,
but I think the Earth was destroyed.
Interesting, if true.
The Vegas odds tonight stand at an
unprecedented 1000-0.
A bet of $0
on Bender pays $ 1000...
...if he wins.
Still, very few takers.
It's not a smart bet.
You're supposed to prance out and
tickle him with your fairy wand.
Instead, prance out
and kick his head off.
Got it.
Large kickle, hold the tickle.
- Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
- Sorry. Here you go.
Thanks.
It was cold on the floor.
- Professor, I got you a program.
- Good.
Just let me put on my
reading glasses.
Why, Zoidberg! There's a lovely
photo of you in here!
In this corner, the confused young
robot with the golden curls...
...weighing 525 pounds...
...The Gender Bender!
Get that hippie out!
And in these two corners...
...weighing 400 tons...
...the gizmo from Pismo...
Beach!
Destructor!
We meet again. Girl who acts
like fighter, training fighter...
...who acts like girl.
- Keep laughing, Funog.
- Ready?
- I was built ready. Give me the bell.
Did you hear a noise?
Final boarding call
for Flight 406...
...non-stop service to pain.
Now boarding standby passengers...
It's a good time
to bring up my new grill.
With its patented design, the fat
drains directly into my mouth.
Fry! Throw in the towel!
For God's sakes, Fry.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
- Mommy!
- Funog, that's enough. Call him off.
Funog?
Why won't anyone help me?
So once more we meet again.
You're just controlling him
like a puppet.
I mean, cheating in a fake fight.
That's low.
Better than being a girl.
Like you. You're a girl!
Oh, right. Girls lack
the will of the warrior.
It's Bendering time!
Take this! And this!
You were an excellent student.
Too bad I was a lousy teacher.
I think you misunderstood
the concept of Bendering time.
See you in girl hell!
I'll be in boy hell, much nicer.
Yes!
Yes!
And the winner is:
Destructor!
I've not seen such a spectacle...
...in all my years
impersonating a sportscaster.
Interesting side note: As a head
without a body, I envy the dead.
No argument here.
I heard somebody got flattened!
Fry, where's your brain slug?
Poor little guy starved to death.
I'm proud of you.
Sure, you lost. You lost bad.
But I beat up someone who hurt
my feelings in high school.
I'm in tremendous pain here.
Great job. You lost, and you made it
look almost half real.
Here's a card good for 10% off
at Bed Bath & Beyond.
Yes! I'm the greatest!
The greatest! Oh...
So ends the chronicle...
...of one of the greatest ever
to play the sport.
- He didn't look half bad in the tutu.
- That he did surely not.
What?

Bicyclops Built for Two
Good news, everyone!
Several years ago, I tried to log on
to AOL, and it just went through!
We're online!
Go ahead, get into these Net Suits.
I designed and tested them myself.
It smells like burning monkey.
Oh? I guess when you're around it all
day, you stop noticing. Off you go!
Behold! The Internet!!
My God! It's full of ads!
Follow me!
It's immense!
It's got every piece of information
one could ever want.
So I see!
What's going on here?
- That's me!
- No, it isn't!
I just took some pictures of your face
and put them on someone else's body.
Are you over 18?
I'm telling you, they've got a chat
room for everybody. Here it is!
That is so gross!
Yeah. I'll stick with this one.
Hi. I'm a naughty nurse,
and I really need someone to talk to.
$9.95 a minute.
You're a dollar naughtier than most.
How about them Knicks?
Hello? Any girls in this room at all?
Yeah, bring on the hot chicks
because I'm a hot stud!
- So are we!
- I'm a woman, if that's what you mean.
I don't play games,
so I'll say I'm a Cyclops...
...a space captain,
the only one of my species...
...and I want to meet a man.
A woman? I'm scared!
Thanks to the Internet,
I'm bored with sex.
Any website to satisfy
my lust for violence?
Is the space pope reptilian?
Get ready for fun, Fry.
Nowadays, we have a game
played entirely on video.
We call it a video game.
Video game, you say?
Well, golly gee!
You mighty spacemen of the future
will have to show me how it works.
The doctor is in!
The doctor is out.
Please sign off. We have a delivery.
Plus, I have to use the phone...
Leela, please tell the others that...
Who are you?
Saw you in the chat room,
but I couldn't talk to you.
After all these years of searching
for another Cyclops.
I've dreamed of this moment
all my life!
Do you think, perhaps, you and I...?
Idiot! Ever since I was abandoned
on Earth...
...I've been searching
for my people, my planet.
I meet another Cyclops,
and you blast him!
That was my one chance
to learn who I am!
Oh, I feel terrible.
If there's anything I can ever do...
Gotcha!
I won! I'm the greatest!
Come on, we have work to do!
Are you still mad at me for wrecking
your only chance...
...to learn the meaning
of your life?
I'm just happy you won a game.
Now let's get this desperately needed
popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14.
<i>Leela, you've got mail!</i>
<i>It's not spam!</i>
- It's him!
<i>- To Leela.</i>
<i>Sub</i>j<i>ect: I am Alcazar.</i>
<i>I got your screen name before</i>
<i>being shot by that moron.</i>
Kicked your ass.
W<i>e have to talk.</i>
<i>Come</i> j<i>oin me on the planet</i>
<i>of your birth. Coordinates follow.</i>
Too bad we gotta make
that urgent popcorn delivery.
It'll get there.
After a lifetime of searching,
I may have found where I belong.
Too bad it's a dump.
Look, that statue's only got
one eye!
- Lazy sculptor.
- Welcome home, Leela.
Alcazar?
Are you real, or am I seeing single?
Of course I am.
After all this time,
somebody else with one eye...
...who isn't a clumsy carpenter
or a kid with a BB gun.
It's all right.
You'll never be alone again.
Come, let me introduce you
to yourself.
- Do you mind if your servants walk?
- Not at all.
We are the last Cyclopses.
Our planet is Cyclopia.
The capital, Cyclops City.
Am I going too fast?
So much information. Yet, somehow
I feel as if I know it already.
This sacred mosaic depicts
our goddess of beauty.
Any artwork of her from the back?
You have the same eye.
Had our race survived, you'd be a
temple priestess, or a supermodel.
Oh, please. Really?
The pirate Purple-Beard,
scourge of the Six Seas.
What's that?
The Forbidden Valley,
where no one may tread.
Is that like a cemetery?
Because I have to pee.
Fry, that's offensive to our people!
Isn't it?
This is my home.
I hope you'll pardon me for living
in a giant castle.
Of course.
If anything, I'm more impressed
I'm gonna need to make some room!
Here I dream Ionely dreams
and cook simple meals.
It's all so sad.
What happened to our people?
It's too painful to speak of now.
I'll show you your rooms.
I heard you from my room.
What's wrong?
Nothing. It's just...
I don't want tears
in your perfect eye.
Is it about the fate of our people?
Because I'm very interested in that.
Okay. But it's chilly.
You'll be all wet with tears.
Let's go into my chamber.
<i>It wasn 't long ago our people</i>
<i>were happy and prosperous.</i>
<i>But the eyeless Mole People</i>
<i>grew</i> j<i>ealous of our visual prowess.</i>
<i>They fired missiles in all directions,</i>
<i>hoping to hit Cyclopia.</i>
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>one of the 40 planets hit was ours.</i>
- How far away, do you think?
- A trillion miles?
Things got hot. You look a little hot,
actually. Take off that jacket.
Our people don't like heat.
Just before the impact...
<i>... our smartest scientists</i>
<i>saved one baby.</i>
Alcazar, I used to be a baby.
It might have been me!
<i>Fortunately, I was a pool cleaner.</i>
<i>And when I emerged from retrieving a</i>
<i>dead possum, I was the only one left.</i>
It's so tragic.
Yes. But the real tragedy
is that our race ends with us.
- It doesn't have to.
- You mean?
You're a male, and I'm a female.
I'm still not following you.
Wake up, my king.
Jeez, what a night.
Make me some coffee, would you?
- Sure. What else with that?
- Pancakes and sausage.
Kitchen's in the basement.
After breakfast, we can talk
about rebuilding our civilization.
Great pancakes.
Yeah, they'll come in handy
if I need to cover any tiny manholes.
We don't want to look like slobs
in front of the others.
Do these dishes, and organize my
collection of naked celebrity photos.
- Look, Alcazar...
- Call me Al.
I know you were living alone
for a long time. I can sympathize.
But I'm not a maid.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I guess it won't work.
So much for the Cyclops race.
Okay, okay. I'll do the dishes.
Hey, where'd they go?
Leela's experiencing a woman's greatest
joy, worshiping a lowlife jerk.
He may be a lowlife jerk,
but I don't trust him.
He's hiding something,
I'll find out what.
Try and stop me!
Al?
I did my hair the way you wanted it.
- Who are these people?
- Friends.
Where'd you get this couch,
and that TV set, all this stuff?
They were giving it away on the
corner. Just like you, Leela.
Too bad they weren't giving away
what you need:
Mouthwash, a back wax
and stain-proof underwear.
You go, girl!
Fry's in the dungeon. Feed him so he
doesn't die and stink up the place.
Can't you let the little guy out?
Jeez, Leela! Twice in one day?
I'm not Superman!
Why did you go
to the Forbidden Valley?
Because Alcazar's hiding something.
You may not like it, believe it
or want to hear it.
Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you.
- I know.
- You do?
If it's obvious to you, with your
learning disability, of course I knew!
He's gross and treats me like a slave.
Dump his one-eyed ass!
I can't. If I leave him,
that's the end of the Cyclops race.
I won't let that happen, even if it
means a lifetime of unhappiness.
Leela? Mop-up in aisle number two!
- I'll break up with him at dinner.
- I'll be there.
Leela! Pig says your slop
tastes like crap!
Yeah. Like crap.
You deserve better than this guy.
Dump him already.
I'm trying.
Hey, everyone,
jam a sock in your spit faucets.
I used to spend nights renting
slasher flicks with Rat and his girl.
Then a beautiful woman arrived...
Stop eating!
She brought new hope for me
and our civilization.
A million centuries of Cyclops destiny
depend on the answer to one question:
Leela, will you marry me?
No! No!
Yes! I will!
They're getting married.
- Congratulations, Leela!
- This is great!
- Glad you could come.
- A magical day!
Welcome!
Get me out of here!
It's horrible eating scraps...
...dropping my waste everywhere,
like an animal.
- Animals go in the corner.
- Why didn't I think of that?
I'd like to help you, but it's my
wedding and I'm kind of busy.
Here, try to be happy for me.
At least one of us will be.
That's it!
It's time for this bird to walk.
We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar!
Let's see why it's called
Forbidden Valley!
No, thanks, I'm good.
You can steal some forbidden stuff.
I don't know. For the first time in my
life, I feel like I've stolen enough.
Bender, snap out of it!
Sorry, I don't know what came over me.
Let's go!
<i>I love stealing</i>
<i>I love taking things</i>
That pig over there is wearing
the same sandals as me.
Come on, boy. Jump! Good boy!
Whoa, Mittens.
My God! Four identical castles!
Each more identical than the last!
Weird. It's another Cyclops,
only this one has five eyes.
And here's another one with no eyes.
Does anyone have a reason
why this couple...
...shall not be joined in the
irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?
Saving a race of one-eyed monsters?
Who could object to that?
Cut to it, preach.
Do you take this woman...
in sickness... Iove... do part?
I do. Faster!
Do you, Leela, copy and paste his
response, till death do you part?
I...
Oh, my God!
Hey, Alcazar? You left somebody
off the guest list.
Why you are so late for our wedding?
And why you have only one eye?
Hey, sweetie. Just go back to the
castle and wait for me.
I can morph into a five-eyed alien,
and I kind of said I'd marry her.
But I'm really a Cyclops,
and I'm really going to marry you.
Oh, yeah? Then what about this?
- This is a bit awkward.
- Who's she?
- Who are they?
- Go back to the castle.
And maybe you'd like to meet her?
And her?
Leela, this must all be
very confusing.
A little. That's why I've decided
to hurt you until you explain it.
- Show us your real form!
- Yeah!
Do it!
Well, this is the real me.
But I can explain. We all have needs.
I needed five weirdos to scrub
my five castles.
I gave you what you wanted
and made money...
...letting Pig watch
through a two-way mirror.
Can any of you say you wouldn't
have done the exact same thing?
He's a saint!
But why all five weddings
on the same day?
You know the price to rent
a tux that changes shape?
- I just have one last question.
- What?
If you can change form, why not change
it in the one place that counts?
- Thanks for saving me from that creep.
- Hey, that's what I do.
I was so desperate to find out who I
really was, I forgot who I really was.
No harm done. In the decades
you'll work to repay me...
...for that popcorn you destroyed...
...you'll have plenty of time
to search for your true home.
I mean, how many planets can there be?

Επιτέλους, η τελευταία
αναφορά της ημέρας.
Καλωσήρθατε στην πόλη των
σφραγίδων, πληθυσμός: πέντε.
Και τώρα για την τελική πινελιά.
Ο κύκλος της γραφειοκρατίας.
Θεούλη μου! Γράμμα από την
Κεντρική Γραφειοκρατία!
Προσοχή: Σε λίγο θα λάβετε γράμμα
από την Κεντρική Γραφειοκρατία.
Είναι από τη Κεντρική
Γραφειοκρατίας!
Θα παίξω πόκερ με τους φίλους
από την παλιά μου δουλειά.
Ενδιαφέρεστε παιδιά;
Τζογάρω μόνο με παλικάρια.
- Θα παίξω!
- Είμαι μέσα!
Λίλα. Φράι. Ρομπότ.
Ό,τι και να συμβεί,
εγώ θα είμαι διαθέσιμος.
Παίζουμε πόκερ. Αλλά οι
φίλοι μου είναι επαγγελματίες.
Σιγά τους ποζεράδες! Εγώ λέω,
αφήστε τα ζάρια να μιλήσουν.
- Απολύθηκε κάνεις;
- Ακόμη καλύτερα.
Η Κεντρική Γραφειοκρατία
έρχεται για επιθεώρηση αύριο.
Επιτέλους θα προαχθώ στο βαθμό 35,
τον 35ο υψηλότερο βαθμό που υπάρχει.
Χέρμες, έχουμε πάρτυ με πόκερ.
Φτιάξε λίγη από τη χαζοσάλτσα σου.
Πέρασα όλη τη μέρα
καθαρίζοντας το γραφείο μου.
Τώρα θα χαλαρώσω με τον Τζαμαϊκανό
τρόπο: ζεστό γάλα και έναν καλό υπνάκο.
Τζαμαϊκανός; Νόμιζα ότι είσαι
κανάς εξωγήινος πατατάνθρωπος.
Πρέπει να είναι το
παλιό μου αφεντικό.
- Γεια Λίλα. Απολύεσαι.
- Το ξέρω.
Συγγνώμη, αλλά άργησες πάνω
από ένα χρόνο για την δουλειά.
Ας αρχίσουν οι αγώνες!
Και εγώ είπα:"Η πρότασή σου για ραντεβού
είναι κολακευτική, αλλά αρνούμαι."
Οι έρωτες στη δουλειά δεν
έχουν ποτέ αίσιο τέλος.
Έτσι συνάντησα και
την φρικτή γυναίκα μου.
Ποτέ δε φορούσες την βέρα σου.
Δεν το ήξερα πως είχες γυναίκα.
Δεν ξέρει πως δουλεύω. Κρατάω
ξεχωριστά την προσωπική μου ζωή.
Μοίρασε! Θα έχεις χρόνο να
μιλήσεις όταν θα είσαι φτωχός.
- Γιατί είναι αυτά;
- Τα τυχερά γυαλιά μου.
Τα έκλεψα από έναν τυχερό τύπο
την ώρα που το τυχερό
σκυλί-οδηγός του χάζευε.
Δε μπορώ να βγάλω
τίποτα με αυτά τα χαρτιά.
Επιτέλους, έχω καλό φύλλο.
Τρία θηλυκά, ένας αριθμός και ένας
βασιλιάς που κάνει εγχείρηση εγκεφάλου.
Δεν έχει σημασία πόσα
έχεις. Ο Μπέντερ έχει ρέντα.
Τι να πω; Μάλλον φταίνε
τα τυχερά γυαλιά μου.
Τίποτα. Τίποτα. Σκατά.
Σκατά. Σκουπίδια.
Κοιτάξτε τα καλά
και στάξτε αλατόνερο.
- Να πάρει.
- Τα λεφτά για το γάλα του μωρού μου!
Τι θα πω τώρα στην
φρικτή γυναίκα μου;
Εγώ θα ανησυχούσα
για το σκουλήκι
που έχει στηθεί για τα
καλά στα έντερά σου.
Για να δω αυτά τα γυαλιά!
Ω, θεοί μου,
γυαλιά με ακτίνες Χ!
Το ορκίζομαι, μου
τα έγραψε ο γιατρός.
Τα χρειάζομαι για να
διαβάζω πράγματα...
- ...πίσω από άλλα πράγματα.
- Κλέφτη!
Σπάστε το λαιμό του!
Μη τον πειράξετε! Είναι
ο καλύτερός μου φίλος...
Δε θα χτυπούσατε κάποιον που φοράει
γυαλιά με ακτίνες Χ, έτσι δεν είναι;
Προσοχή με το χέρι. Ο κώλος μου!
Αγία μοσχοβίτισα αγελάδα!
Ήταν φαντάσματα! Μεγάλα!
Και ένας ανεμοστρόβιλος!
Δε θα περάσω ποτέ μου
τώρα την επιθεώρηση!
Θα με πάνε τόσο κάτω όσο και
ένα ραβδί του λίμπο στο καρναβάλι!
Και αυτό είναι το χαμηλότερο που
μπορεί να πάει ένα ραβδί του λίμπο.
Μην ανησυχείς.
Θα τα μπαλώσουμε.
Είναι πολύ αργά. Ο επιθεωρητής θα
είναι εδώ σε ακριβώς ένα δευτερόλεπτο.
- Ποια στο καλό είσαι εσύ;
- Μόργκαν Πράκτορ, βαθμός 19.
Χέρμες Κόνραντ, βαθμός 36.
- Αρκετά με τις επικυρώσεις. Ξεκινάμε;
- Από εδώ παρακαλώ.
Φαίνεσαι αηδιαστικά ήρεμος.
Μην ανησυχείς.
Έχω σχέδιο.
Θα πηδήξω!
- Όχι!
- Όχι!
Κάνε τούμπα!
Μη το κάνεις! Έχεις
τόσα να ζήσεις ακόμα!
Αντίστροφη ψυχολογία;
Παλιόφιλε, μη πηδήξεις!
Χρησιμοποίησε μια μέθοδο που δε
θα κάνει ζημιά στο συκώτι σου.
Το χρειάζονται και άλλοι ξέρεις...
Άντρα, όχι!
Αφήστε με ήσυχο! Δεν είμαι
φτιαγμένος για γραφειοκράτης!
Είμαι σχολαστικός μόνο
το 78,65% του χρόνου.
Δεν είμαι άξιος να βάλω
σφραγίδα σε έγγραφο,
γι'αυτό θα σφραγίσω το
τσιμέντο με το σώμα μου!
Αν τελειώσεις την διαδικασία θανάτου
σου χωρίς να συμπληρώσεις μια αίτηση...
...αυτοκτονίας ή και
πτώσης, θα υποβιβαστείς.
Ζωή.
Θάνατος.
Έτσι κι αλλιώς θα υποβιβαστώ
σε ένα μικροσκοπικό κελί.
Άγιε κάποιε... από κάπου.
Σε απαλλάσσω από τα καθήκοντά
σου. Είσαι σε άδεια μετ'αποδοχών.
Η απόλυτη τιμωρία.
Προτείνω την θεραπεία στο Σπα
5 του πλανήτη Σάουνα. Διάβασε.
Σπα 5;
Είναι καλό;
Εξαιρετικό. Δε ξέρω
τίποτα γι' αυτό...
...αλλά μου δίνουν πλαγκτόν
για καθένα που στέλνω.
Πρέπει να αναθέσω σε
κάποιον να πάρει τη θέση του.
Αναθέτω εμένα.
Δέχομαι. Καλωσήρθα.
Κανονίστηκε. Ο Χέρμες θα
χαλαρώσει και ο Ζόιμπεργκ θα φάει.
Την περασμένη Δευτέρα, γιατί χρειάστηκε
το διπλό χρόνο απ' ότι είχε υπολογιστεί;
Ο Φράι σκάλωσε το
κεφάλι του σε ένα κρατήρα.
Νόμιζα ότι θα χωρούσε.
Όταν γινόταν
αυτό, τι έκανες εσύ;
Διαγωνισμό ποτού με
τον αυτόματο πιλότο.
- Θα νικούσα αλλά ξεμείναμε από ελιές.
- Μπορώ να εξηγήσω.
Μπορείς να εξηγήσεις το πως φύγατε
χωρίς αρκετές ελιές; Δε το νομίζω.
- Τι είναι εδώ, σχολείο;
- Έλεγχος ντουλαπιού!
Γιατί δεν είναι αλφαβητικά;
- Τι;
- Το φερμουάρ έπρεπε να είναι κάτω.
Καμιά φορά ένας άντρας
αισθάνεται μοναξιά.
Δεν έχω ξαναδεί ποτέ
μου κάτι σαν αυτό!
- Γιατί έχει γιαούρτι εδώ μέσα;
- Μπορώ να εξηγήσω.
Κάποτε ήταν γάλα, αλλά ο
χρόνος μας αλλάζει όλους.
Είσαστε ελεύθεροι να φύγετε!
Φράι, θα σου μιλήσω ιδιαιτέρως.
Αυτό είναι το ντουλάπι του
άλλου Φράι. Εγώ λέγομαι "Πράι".
Παραδέξου το.
Είσαι βρομύλος.
Ένας βρόμικος,
αηδιαστικός βρομύλος.
Βρομόπαιδο! Βρωμιάρη,
βρωμιάρη, βρωμιάρη!
Τι τρέχει; Εγώ νόμιζα
πως ήσουν κατά της βρώμας.
Με περικυκλώνουν
καθαροί όλη τη μέρα.
Τίποτα δεν με ανάβει πιο
πολύ από έναν βρομύλο.
Σταμάτα.
Άκουσε γουρούνι. Κανείς δε πρέπει να
μάθει. Αν ρωτήσει κανείς, θα το αρνηθώ.
Όπως με όλα τα
κορίτσια που τα είχα.
Και δύο, και τρία, και τέσσερα.
Άντε, δούλεψε τα μπράτσα!
Αυτό δεν είναι σπα,
είναι κατασκήνωση με έργα.
Άμα σε πιάσω Ζόιμπεργκ, θα
σκοτώσω με τη μύτη μιας γαρίδας!
Δώστου μία και από μένα, αδερφέ.
Δε ξέρω γιατί πάω σ'αυτόν.
Δεν αστοχώ δύο φορές, κατασκηνωτές.
Για αυτούς τους
έξι λόγους υποβιβάζω
- τη Λίλα σε υπό-πιλότο.
- Για ποιόν;
- Για τον αυτόματο πιλότο.
- Αυτός ο μπεκρής;
Μπέντερ, εσύ είσαι υπεύθυνος για τις
σωματικές λειτουργίες του καθηγητή.
Είναι πλήρης απασχόληση.
Φράι, σε προβιβάζω σε αρχι-πακετά.
Δε θα κάνεις παραδόσεις και θα έχεις
το γραφείο σου δίπλα στο δικό μου.
Τζάμι!
Θα κολλήσεις πέντε για
να συνεχίσουμε το μίτινγκ;
Και στο πόδι;
Ελεύθεροι.
Δε ξέρω γιατί είναι
καλή μαζί σου.
Είναι μισητό τέρας. Με
γιουχάρισε και με χτύπησε.
Ρισκάρει τη φιλία μου μαζί της.
Τι σου συνέβει;
Έβγαλα βόλτα τον καθηγητή.
Ήμασταν στο πάρκο και...
...μια γυναίκα λέει πως
της έκλεψα την τσάντα.
Της πέταξα τον καθηγητή αλλά έπρεπε να
την χτυπήσω και με μια τσάντα που βρήκα.
Η Μόργκαν φταίει. Αυτή η
χαρτομούρα-τυπολόγα βρώμα.
Αν ήταν εδώ, θα...
- Τι, είναι πίσω μου;
- Όχι, είμαι μπροστά σου.
Μόργκαν; Είναι 3 τα μεσάνυχτα.
Ένας ασβός έριξε τα σκουπίδια
μου και το μυαλό μου πήγε σε 'σένα.
Θεέ μου, είναι τόσο...
...απεχθής.
- Ώστε εδώ τρως;
- Τρώω και κοιμάμαι.
Ω, Φράι!
Ο Μπέντερ είναι συγκάτοικός μου.
Μπορεί να γυρίσει όπου να'ναι.
Τον διέταξα να βγάλει το κερί
από τα αυτιά του καθηγητή.
Φράι, σου έφτιαξα ένα
κερί από... τι στο...;
Τώρα κατάλαβα. Τώρα το έπιασα.
Τώρα όλα τα κομμάτια ενώνονται.
Η προαγωγή, ο νάνος στη λέσχη
βιβλίων που μου κλέβει τις ιδέες μου.
Όλα ενώνονται!
Πρέπει να πω πως αυτό
μου άνοιξε τα μάτια!
Άλλη μια υπόθεση έκλεισε,
αγαπητέ μου Γουάτσον.
Γύρνα πίσω!
Είναι μια ψευδαίσθηση!
Ήμουν τυφλός αλλά τώρα βλέπω.
Η γάτα βγήκε από το κλουβί!
Σχετικά με χθες βράδυ,
ήταν όλα μια παρεξήγηση.
Δεν κατάλαβες; Θα στο εξηγώ:
Εσύ έκανες σεξ με εσένα.
Όχι. Ένας γραφειοκράτης του βαθμού
μου δε μπορεί να συνουσιάζεται.
Αυτό είναι που το κάνει λαβράκι.
Είναι το απαγορευμένος φρούτο.
"Μαντέψτε ποιος είδε τον Φράι
και την Μόργκαν να το κάνουν."
Θα πουν: "Ποιος Μπέντερ;"
Και εγώ θα πω: "Ήταν ο
καλός γερο-Μπέντερ..."
Τι του έκανες;
Κατέβασα τον εγκέφαλό
του. Ο Μπέντερ είναι εδώ.
Οι αναμνήσεις του, ο
στη-μάπα-σου χαρακτήρας του.
Είμαι ο Μπέντερ, εισάγετε κολώνα.
Μα... Ο Μπέντερ χρειάζεται
εγκέφαλο. Για να λέει εξυπνάδες!
Σταμάτα να κάνεις πράγματα!
Το έστειλα για
αρχειοθέτηση στο Κεντρικό.
Έπρεπε. Ήταν κακό ρομπότ.
Ήταν κακός φίλος.
Τον θέλω πίσω!
Έπρεπε να συμπληρώσεις
μια αίτηση 20 χρόνια πριν.
Σε σιχάθηκα και εσένα
και την γραφειοκρατία σου!
Βρομόπαιδο!
Βρομόπαιδο!
Είχατε σχέση;
Με αγάπησε γιατί είμαι βρομύλος.
Την αγάπησα γιατί
είμαι απεγνωσμένος.
Είμαι ο Μπέντερ, εισάγετε κολώνα.
Χωρίς το μυαλό του, είναι
ήσυχος και εξυπηρετικός.
Πρέπει να πάμε στην Κεντρική
και να πάρουμε το δίσκο!
- Ναι οπωσδήποτε.
- Ναι!
Γιατί;
Χωρίς να το πολυσκεφτούμε θα πάμε.
Δε μπορείτε έτσι απλά
να μπείτε στην Κεντρική.
Είναι ένας μπερδεμένος ιστός από
κόκκινο ταινία και κανονισμούς.
Δεν έχω πάει αλλά ένας φίλος τρελάθηκε
προσπαθώντας να βρει την τουαλέτα.
Χρειαζόμαστε ένα οδηγό.
Κάποιον που να έχει ξαναπάει.
Εγώ έχω πάει.
Πολλές φορές.
Τα καροτσάκια βγαίνουν
γεμάτα αλλά μπαίνουν άδεια.
Είναι αντιπαραγωγικό!
Με το να σπρώχνουμε
άδεια καρότσια
είναι ο ποιο κοντινός τρόπος
για να κοιμηθούμε.
Θα αύξαναν την παραγωγικότητα...
...αν τα άδεια καρότσια
μετέφεραν εξοπλισμό.
Μου αρέσει ο τρόπος που σκέφτεσαι.
Κύριε.
Ξέρεις, πρέπει να
γίνεις γραφειοκράτης.
Πόση ώρα θα πάρει;
Εγώ ακόμα περιμένω για
πιστοποιητικό γέννησης.
Δε μου φαίνεται ότι θα τα
καταφέρω μέσα. Καλή τύχη.
Παρατήστε με εκεί που θα πεθάνω.
Κάποια είχε μωρό.
Ελάτε, έχω μια καλύτερη ιδέα.
Είμαστε από την εταιρεία μεταφορών.
Ήρθαμε για να μεταφέρουμε ένα ρομπότ.
Είμαι ο Μπεντερ, εισάγετε κολώνα.
Φαίνεται πως έχουμε
καινούργιο ψαλίδι γραφείου.
Προσέξτε,
προσέξτε!
Θα τρακάρω! Έκανα μανούβρα
για να σας αποφύγω.
Μπορείς να μας πεις
που πάνε τα πακέτα;
Κεντρική αρχειοθέτηση.
- Εντάξει, ευχαριστούμε.
- Ωραία.
Όχι!
Φυσικά και ξέρω που
είναι. Είμαι βαθμού 20.
- Που είναι;
- Δε μπορώ να σας πω.
- Μοιάζω για βαθμού 16;
- Φτάνουμε αργά, αργά στο πουθενά.
Θα το στείλω στα
κεντρική αρχειοθέτησης.
Και θα το εντοπίσουμε με
το εντοπιστικό μου μαραφέτι.
<i>Κρύο.
Χλυαρό.</i>
<i>Καυτό, καυτό, καυτό, καυτό...</i>
Μη πείτε στο αφεντικό
μου ότι κοιμόμουνα.
Εδώ είμαστε.
Μπουκάρουμε, παίρνουμε το δίσκο
του Μπέντερ και βγαίνουμε. Εντάξει;
Δε θα το βρούμε ποτέ.
Είμαι ο Μπέντερ, εισάγετε κολώνα.
Σωστά! Τίποτα δεν τελειώνει
όταν υπάρχει ελπίδα.
Χάσατε τίποτα; Έπρεπε να
το ξέρω ότι θα ερχόσασταν.
Και το ήξερα, γι'αυτό ήρθα.
Τελειώσαμε. Είσαι σατανική.
Δε θέλω να σε ξαναδώ ποτέ ξανά.
Θα μας βοηθήσεις για
χάρη του παλιού καιρού;
Είναι χαμένος στο μεγάλο
σωρό με τα εισερχόμενα.
Θα χρειαζόταν ένας πυρηνικός
ταξινομητής για να τον βρείτε.
Με φωνάξατε;
Στο καλό, πήδα επιτέλους! Σταμάτα
να μονοπωλείς το υγιές συκώτι!
Θέλω να ζήσω!
Με την οργάνωση του
εργατικού Σπα,
φούντωσε ξανά η αγάπη
μου για την γραφειοκρατία.
Ο Χέρμες μου οργάνωσε εκείνη την
κόλαση ώστε όλη η σωματική εργασία να...
...γίνεται από έναν
και μόνο Αυστραλό.
- Πως ξέρατε που είμαστε εδώ;
- Ο Δρ. Ζόιντμπεργκ.
Εγώ ήμουν!
Είμαι ήρωας!
Αίτημα για εξήγηση του
συμβάντος της συνάντησης.
Νούμερο 1.0!
Νούμερο 1.0, σε εκλιπαρώ για μια
εκτάκτου ανάγκης αρχειοθέτηση...
..υπό τον κανόνα 2...
Μη με ζαλίζεις με κανονισμούς!
Ήμουν σε επιτροπή
για την αναθεώρηση...
...του χρώματος του εξωφύλλου
του βιβλίου των κανονισμών.
Το κρατήσαμε γκρι.
Πρέπει να βρω το δίσκο
με το μυαλό του φίλου μου.
Πολύ καλά, αλλά η άδειά σου
θα αφαιρεθεί αν αποτύχεις...
...να αρχειοθετήσεις
τον μεγάλο σωρό
με τα εισερχόμενα μέχρι
την ώρα που κλείνουμε.
- 1 μ. μ.
- Μόνο 4 λεπτά απομένουν.
Ρίξε τον ρυθμό.
<i>Γεννήθηκα και έγινε τυφώνας
και είχαμε 2.5 μέτρα νερού</i>
<i>Έκλαιγα όλη νύχτα και σκόρπιζα
τα τουβλάκια μου παντού</i>
<i>Αυτό το παιδί γεννήθηκε
για γραφειοκράτης,</i>
<i>γεννήθηκε και
παθιασμένο και περήφανο</i>
<i>Και συμπλήρωσα τις αιτήσεις
για το πάρτυ γενεθλίων μου</i>
<i>- Κάτι άλλαξε όταν έγινε επαγγελματίας.
- Αρχειοθετούσε αλλά δε γελούσε.</i>
<i>- Ξέχασε ότι δεν ήταν για τον βαθμό
- Είναι για την ευχαρίστηση, παιδιά</i>
<i>Δε διαλέξαμε να είμαστε γραφειοκράτες
Αυτό μας έκανε ο παντοδύναμος</i>
<i>Να συμπεριφερόμαστε σαν ζώα να
τους κάνουμε να περιμένουν στην ουρά,</i>
<i>ακόμα και αν
κανένας δε μας πληρώνουν.</i>
<i>Ο κόσμος υποτιμά
τους γραφειοκράτες.</i>
<i>Είμαστε σχολαστικοί,
πιεστικοί και περίεργοι</i>
<i>Τώρα ήρθε η ώρα, να κάνεις αυτό που
αγαπάς ακόμα και αν δεν είναι καλή ιδέα</i>
<i>- Είπαν δεν έπρεπε να γίνω χειρούργος.
- Τα έκανα πάνω στην τοστιέρα μου.</i>
<i>Είπαν ότι δεν πρέπει να
πιλοτάρω με μόνο ένα μάτι</i>
<i>Είμαι ο Μπέντερ, εισάγετε κολώνα</i>
<i>Τραγουδήστε όλοι Τζαμάικα</i>
<i>Μόνο οι γραφειοκράτες</i>
<i>Μόνο οι βαθμού 19</i>
<i>- Τζαμάικα
- Μαζί μου</i>
<i>Ήρθε η ώρα να κάνεις αυτό που θες
ακόμα και αν δεν είναι καλή ιδέα</i>
Είμαι ο Μπέντερ μωρό μου!
Παρακαλώ εισάγετε αλκοόλ!
- Ναι
- Συγχαρητήρια!
Τελείωσες 2 δευτερόλεπτα πιο
νωρίς, γι'αυτό σε υποβιβάζω.
Οι καλοί γραφειοκράτες
ποτέ δεν τελειώνουν νωρίς.
Δε πειράζει. Τουλάχιστον
σε έχουμε πίσω ξανά.
Όχι ακόμα. Εγώ είμαι ο γραφειοκράτης
υπεύθυνος για το Πλανητικό Εξπρές.
Και έχω κάνω κάποιες
αλλαγές. Φράι, απολύεσαι.
- Δεύτερον...
- Μισό λεπτό!
Όσο αρχειοθετούσα βρήκα ένα έγγραφο
συμπληρωμένο από την Μόργκαν Πράκτορ.
Έγγραφο Β. Ενημέρωση
ρομαντικής περίπτυξης.
Με αποπλάνησε!
Δεν είναι για σένα. Είναι για το
συνοδό μου στο χορό του Λυκείου.
Ένα ραντεβού που
έληξε με απογοήτευση.
Ναι. Αλλά το
σφράγισες 4 μόνο φορές!
Όχι! Όχι! Ήμουν
μικρή και άμυαλη!
Είσαι τεχνικά σωστή. Ο καλύτερος
τρόπος να είναι κάποιος σωστός.
Εδώ και τώρα σε
προβιβάζω σε βαθμό 37.
Και όσο για σένα...
Φρουροί!
Φέρτε μου τα έγγραφα που πρέπει
να συμπληρώσω για να την πάρετε.
Μου φαίνεται ότι χρειάζομαι
πίσω τον ηρωικό μου γραφειοκράτη.
Με εξαιρετικά
χαμηλωμένο μισθό, φυσικά.
- Ναι!
- Καλύτερο από το τίποτα.
Μπορώ και εγώ να
έχω χαμηλωμένο μισθό;
Φυσικά! Στην πραγματικότητα,
χαμηλωμένοι μισθοί για όλους.
Έλα γυναίκα!
Την κάνουμε από 'δω!
Ήρθε η ώρα για το τραγούδι μου!
<i>Όταν ήμουν 2 χρονών
έγινε παλλιροϊκό κύμα</i>

Καλά νέα, παιδιά!
Το πανεπιστήμιο θα με πάει στο δικαστήριο
με κατηγορίες για τη συμπεριφορά μου.
Μισό λεπτό, αυτά δεν
είναι καθόλου καλά νέα.
Ότι και αν κάνετε, είμαι σίγουρη
πως υπάρχει μια λογική εξήγηση.
Ναι, αλλά δεν
την ακούνε.
Όλοι είναι υπέρ για να σώσουν
τον εγκέφαλο του Χίτλερ.
Αλλά αν τον βάλεις στο
σώμα ενός λευκού καρχαρία;
Ξαφνικά το παρατραβάς!
Καθηγητά Φάρνσγουωρθ, γνωρίζετε
γιατί σας καλέσαμε σήμερα εδώ;
Ακούστε με,
πομπώδεις απατεώνες!
Αν είναι να καταστραφώ,
θα σας πάρω όλους μαζί μου!
Πρύτανη Βέρνον,
ξέρω την αλήθεια!
Εσύ οδηγούσες το αυτοκίνητο
εκείνη τη νύχτα, όχι το άλογό σου.
Πρύτανη Έψιλον, ξέρω τα πάντα για το
"Τμήμα Μαθημάτων για καθαρισμό πισίνων".
Και δρ. Γουέρνστρομ,
Γουέρνστρομ!
Για την ακρίβεια καθηγητά, σας
καλέσαμε εδώ για να πούμε...
...έκπληξη.
- Χρόνια Πολλά!
- Έκπληξη!
<i>ΕΥΤΗΧΙΣΜΕΝΗ ΕΠΕΤΕΙΟ
ΚΑΘΗΓΗΤΗ ΦΑΡΝΣΓΟΥΕΡΘ</i>
Και εσύ προπονητή Σμάλεϊ!
Ή καλύτερα
"προπονητή μαλλιά";
Όχι καθηγητά, είναι
πάρτυ έκπληξη...
...για τα 150ά γενέθλιά σας!
Καλησπέρα,
εγώ...
Συγγνώμη.
Είμαι ο Μπέντερ και θα
συντονίζω την ομιλία.
Λένε ότι μπορείς να κρίνεις έναν
άνθρωπο από τις παρέες που κάνει.
Ορίστε ο παλιότερος φίλος του καθηγητή,
ένας περίεργος, βρωμερός αστακός!
Καλησπέρα κυρίες
και μικρόβια.
Δεν ήταν αστείο. Απευθυνόμουν
στον πρύτανη Στρεπτόκοκκο.
Κοιτάξτε, δεν λέω ότι ο καθηγητής
Φάρνσγουερθ είναι γέρος...
...αλλά αν εξετάσετε την ηλικία του,
είναι πολύ πιθανό να πεθάνει σύντομα.
Εσύ με τα ντραμς;
Αυτό ήταν το αστείο.
Είναι το νούμερό του στο
Απόλλο ξανά από την αρχή.
Πού θα ήταν ο καθηγητής χωρίς μαθητές
που να τον αγαπούν και τον σέβονται;
Ακριβώς εκεί!
Από όλα τα πρώην μέλη του πληρώματος
του μεταφορικού πλοίου του...
...ο επόμενος ομιλητής μας είναι
με μεγάλη διαφορά ο πιο ζωντανός.
Πλοίαρχε Μάσκι;
Δεν θα ήθελα να
γίνω σαν και αυτόν.
Και τώρα κάποιος που δεν
χρειάζεται παρουσίαση.
Φράι, ανέβα
εκεί πάνω!
Ευχαριστώ.
Όταν μου ζήτησαν για πρώτη
φορά να κάνω μια ταινία
για τον ανιψιό μου,
τον καθηγητή...
...σκέφτηκα, γιατί να το κάνω;
Όμως αργότερα, η Λίλα έκανε την ταινία.
Αλλά αν την είχα κάνει εγώ, θα υπήρχαν
περισσότερες γυμνές πάνω σε μηχανές.
Βάλε την ταινία.
<i>ΧΙΟΥΜΠΕΡΤ ΦΡΑΝΣΓΟΥΩΡΘ:
ΜΙΑ ΖΩΝΤΑΝΗ ΝΕΚΡΟΛΟΓΙΑ</i>
<i>Ο Χιούμπερτ Ξ. Φάρνσγουωρθ
γεννήθηκε την 9η Απριλίου του 2851...</i>
<i>...στην πιο φλώρικη γειτονιά της Νέας
Νέας Υόρκης: Το εργαστήριο της κόλασης.</i>
<i>Ήταν ένα πρόωρα
αναπτυγμένο παιδί,</i>
<i>που έμαθε να διαβάζει όταν
φορούσε ακόμα πάνες...</i>
<i>...στην ηλικία των 8.</i>
<i>Γρήγορα έγινε
ένας γλοιώδης έφηβος.</i>
Συναγερμός φλώρου!
<i>Μετά από 14 χρόνια
στο πανεπιστήμιο...</i>
<i>...διάλεξε την λαμπρή
ζωή του επιστήμονα.</i>
<i>Γρήγορα αυτοκίνητα,
μοδάτα νυχτερινά κέντρα...</i>
<i>...όμορφες γυναίκες.</i>
<i>Ο καθηγητής τα σχεδίαζε όλα,
δουλεύοντας στην γκαρσονιέρα του.</i>
<i>Για 50 χρόνια εργάστηκε στην
Φιλική Εταιρεία Ρομπότ της Μαμάς...</i>
<i>...όπου έφτιαξε το πρώτο ρομπότ
ικανό να πάρει δάνειο για πλοίο.</i>
<i>Και τώρα, ακόμα και αν
κοντεύει τα 150ά του γενέθλια...</i>
<i>...ο καθηγητής ακόμα διαθέτει
το φλογισμένο πάθος της νιότης.</i>
<i>Ακούστε με,
πομπώδεις απατεώνες!</i>
<i>Αν πέσω κάτω θα σας
πάρω όλους μαζί μου!</i>
<i>ΧΙΟΥΜΠΕΡΤ Ξ.
ΦΡΑΝΣΓΟΥΩΡΘ: ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΤΑΙ;</i>
Θα μας πείτε λίγα
λόγια καθηγητά;
Είπα λόγια.
Μου δίνει μεγάλη χαρά να μπορώ
να δω τα επιτεύγματα μιας ζωής...
...μαζεμένα σε μια
ταινία τριών λεπτών.
Τα καλύτερα χρόνια μου περάσαν.
Τόσα πολλά που δεν έγιναν.
Τόσο λίγος χρόνος.
Πολύ αστεία πράγματα!
Η ζωή μου τελείωσε.
Όχι, δεν τελείωσε. Έχεις
ακόμα 10 χρόνια να ζήσεις.
Λίλα, μπορεί να ζήσει
για άλλα 100 χρόνια!
Όχι δεν μπορεί.
Όταν φτάνεις τα 160...
...ρομπότ από την
Ομάδα Ηλιοβασιλέματος
σε παίρνουν σε ένα
μυστηριώδη πλανήτη...
...και δεν επιστρέφεις ποτέ.
Ένας πλανήτης γεμάτος
γέρους. Πού είναι;
Κανείς δεν ξέρει.
Τόσες αγάπες,
μισο-αγαπημένες.
Τόσες εφευρέσεις,
μισο-εφευρημένες.
Μόνο αυτή η ηλίθια μηχανή του
χρόνου με καθυστέρησε 15 χρόνια.
Αν δούλευε θα μπορούσες να πας πίσω
και να μη ξόδευες το χρόνο σου σ' αυτή.
Δεν υπάρχει κανείς για
να συνεχίσει αφού φύγω.
Κανείς για να
αναλάβει το έργο μου,
την έρευνά μου και την
αμύθητη περιουσία μου.
Για το Θεό,
αυτό είναι!
- Πρέπει να ορίσω ένα διάδοχο!
- Ένα διάδοχο;
- Ένα διάδοχο του καθηγητή;
- Δεν υπάρχει χρόνος για χάσιμο.
Πάω στο εργαστήριό μου για να φτιάξω
μια μηχανή που βρίσκει διαδόχους!
Ο καθηγητής βρίσκεται στο
εργαστήριο εδώ και μέρες!
Ελπίζω να μην πέθανε. Εκτός
και αν όρισε εμένα σαν διάδοχο.
Τότε ελπίζω να πέθανε.
Εσύ ο διάδοχος; Πάνω
από το άδειο καβούκι μου!
Ο καθηγητής θα
διαλέξει εμένα.
Μόνο εγώ έχω την καβουρίσια
αποφασιστικότητά του.
Ναι καλά, Ζόιντμπεργκ!
Χώστα εκεί που το είδος σου
παραδοσιακά τα χώνει.
Ο μόνος λογικός τρόπος να βρούμε ένα
διάδοχο είναι με ένα διαγωνισμό λίμπο.
- Τι;
- Το Κίνγκστον κυριαρχεί.
Δύο λυγίζουν, ένας
σηκώνεται όρθιος.
Ο καθηγητής εμπιστεύεται σε εμένα
το γιγάντιο διαστημόπλοιό του.
Δεν θα εμπιστευόταν
σ' εσάς ούτε τη μασέλα του.
Ναι, θα την
εμπιστευόταν.
Συγγνώμη παιδιά, αλλά πρέπει να σας
υπενθυμίσω πως "το αίμα νερό δε γίνεται".
Αίμα. Δεν γίνεται. Νερό.
Έχω μια πολύ δραματική ανακοίνωση.
Γι' αυτό και όποιος έχει αδύναμη
καρδιά πρέπει να φύγει τώρα.
Αντίο.
- Καθηγητά;
- Η ανακοίνωση.
Όπως όλοι γνωρίζετε, δεν μου μένει
και πολύ χρόνος σ' αυτόν τον κόσμο.
- Ναι το ξέρουμε.
- Είσαι με το ένα πόδι στον τάφο.
Γι' αυτό και διάλεξα
τον διάδοχό μου.
Είναι κάποιος, στον
οποίο έχω μεγάλη πίστη...
...ακόμα και αν το μυαλό του
είναι μη αναπτυγμένο
και δεν έχει καταφέρει τίποτα.
Ο πιο κοντινός μου
ζωντανός συγγενής...
...ο κλώνος μου,
Κιούμπερτ Φάρνσγουωρθ.
Είναι άθλιος!
Γαμώτο. Τουλάχιστον να είμαι
υπεύθυνος για τη μασέλα σου;
Θα το 'θελες.
Από που ήρθε;
12 χρόνια πριν, ξεκίνησα
τη διαδικασία κλωνοποίησης...
...αφαιρώντας δερματικά κύτταρα από
τον πιο άσχημο όγκο της πλάτης μου.
Αν είναι κλώνος σου, γιατί
δεν έχει μύτη σαν την δική σου;
Τον άφησα στον πρώτο του σωλήνα
πολύ καιρό και πιέστηκε στα τοιχώματα.
- Είναι ηλίθιος ή απλά άσχημος;
- Ας το ανακαλύψουμε.
Τι; Δεν έχετε ξαναδεί
πέος ιδιοφυίας πότε σας;
- Όχι, ποτέ.
- Μια φορά στο πάρκο.
Αφού εγώ θα
είμαι υπεύθυνος...
...ας εξετάσω το
υποτιθέμενο πλήρωμά μου.
Αν μπορείς να το πεις πλήρωμα.
Πρώτα απ' όλα, δρ. Ζόιντμπεργκ...
έχεις στα σοβαρά πτυχίο ιατρικής;
Το έχασα σε ένα ηφαίστειο.
Και γιατί χρειαζόμαστε
ένα ρομπότ λυγίσματος εδώ;
Σε τι είναι πιθανό
να μας χρησιμεύεις;
Εγώ, δεν μιλάει Αγγλικά.
Και γιατί ο πιλότος μας
έχει μόνο ένα μάτι;
Υπάρχει κάποιος που θέλω να γνωρίσεις.
Το όνομά του είναι βαθιά προοπτική!
Ρε παλιόπαιδο...
Αυτό πόνεσε...
τον αέρα!
Αυτό πρέπει να βρέξω.
Κιούμπερτ, έλα εδώ. Θα σου
δείξω κάτι καταπληκτικό.
Τι είναι; Ένας ικανός
υπάλληλος; Δεν το νομίζω.
Τον αλητάκο.
Σαν διάδοχός μου, σε εμπιστεύομαι
για να συνεχίσεις το έργο μου.
Αυτές είναι μερικές
από τις μισοεφευρέσεις
που θα περάσεις τη ζωή σου
για να τις τελειώσεις.
Δεν ήξερα ότι ήσουν ο εφευρέτης
όλης αυτής της σαβούρας.
Αυτό είναι το βραβευμένο μου
ωσμοσκόπιο.
Αν κάποιος σκύλος χέσει οπουδήποτε
στο σύμπαν εγώ σίγουρα θα το ξέρω.
Και αυτός είναι ο
παγκόσμιος μεταφραστής μου.
Δυστυχώς, μέχρι τώρα μεταφράζει
σε μια ακατανόητη νεκρή γλώσσα.
- Γεια.
- Bonjour.(Καλημέρα στα Γαλλικά)
Τρελά αλαμπουρνέζικα!
Δεν έχεις καμιά
εφεύρεση που να αξίζει;
Βέβαια!
Έλα εδώ.
Αυτοί είναι οι κινητήρες
σκοτεινής ύλης που ανακάλυψα.
Επιτρέπουν στο σκάφος μου να ταξιδεύει
από γαλαξία σε γαλαξία σε μερικές ώρες.
Είναι αδύνατον. Δεν μπορείς να πας πιο
γρήγορα από την ταχύτητα του φωτός.
Φυσικά και όχι.
Γι' αυτό και οι επιστήμονες αύξησαν
την ταχύτητα του φωτός το 2208.
Επίσης αδύνατον.
Και αυτό που κάνει τους κινητήρες
μου πραγματικά μοναδικούς
είναι η μονάδα καύσης που
δίνει 200% απόδοση καυσίμου.
Ειδικά αυτό είναι αδύνατον.
- Καθόλου. Είναι πολύ απλό.
- Τότε εξήγησε το.
Αυτό είναι αδύνατον!
Μου ήρθε σε ένα όνειρο και
το ξέχασα σε ένα άλλο όνειρο.
Οι εξηγήσεις σου είναι καθαρά
πρώτης τάξεως παπαριές.
Όλα αυτά είναι αδύνατα!
Τίποτα δεν είναι αδύνατον
αν μπορείς να το φανταστείς.
Αυτό σημαίνει να είσαι επιστήμονας.
Όχι, αυτό σημαίνει
να είσαι μαγικό ξωτικό.
Θεέ μου!
Είναι ο Έλζαρ, ο μάγειρας από την
τηλεόραση. Σκοτώστε με τώρα!
- Πως τα πάμε εδώ;
- Έλζαρ, τα πάντα είναι εκπληκτικά!
Είσαι μηχανή που
φιλάει κώλους;
Ναι κύριε, και
πολύ καλή κύριε!
Είναι ένα υπέροχο βράδυ.
Αισθάνομαι τόσο ωραία που έχω κάποιον
να συνεχίσει το έργο της ζωής μου.
Και όλα χάρη στον Κιούμπερτ.
Μπορεί να είμαι όμοιός σου
με κάθε πιθανό τρόπο...
...αλλά δεν σημαίνει
ότι σου μοιάζω κιόλας.
Δεν θέλω να γίνω εφευρέτης.
Θέλω να γίνω κάτι χρήσιμο,
σαν βοηθός δασκάλων...
...ή δεσμοφύλακας ή συγγραφέας
καρτούν επιστημονικής φαντασίας.
Και τι θα γίνουν οι ελπίδες μου
και τα όνειρά μου...
...και οι θαυμαστές μου εφευρέσεις;
Σε όλη σου τη ζωή, η μόνη σου
μισοπετυχημένη εφεύρεση ήμουν εγώ.
Και ούτε εγώ βγήκα όπως με ήθελες.
- Ακόμη όλα καλά, παιδιά;
- Ναι, Έλζαρ.
Ωραία, γιατί ξέχασα να
μαγειρέψω το κοτόπουλο.
Κακά νέα, παιδιά.
Τη στιγμή που θα βλέπετε αυτή
την κασέτα εγώ θα έχω φύγει...
...αφήνοντας πίσω μου μια ζωή γεμάτη
αποτυχίες και την αυθεντική λεκάνη μου.
Έλεγα ψέματα για την
ηλικία μου. Δεν είμαι 150.
Είμαι 160.
Ματαιοδοξία, το όνομά σου
είναι καθηγητής Φάρνσγουωρθ.
Και τώρα που δεν έχω
κανένα λόγο να ζω...
...κάλεσα τα ρομπότ της Ομάδας Ηλιο-
βασιλέματος να με πάρουν μακριά.
<i>ΓΙΑ ΤΟ ΠΛΗΡΩΜΑ ΜΟΥ</i>
Αντίο, άπονε κόσμε!
Αντίο άπονη λάμπα.
Αντίο άπονες
βελούδινες κουρτίνες...
...κεντημένες με κάτι που φαίνεται να
είναι κάποιο είδος άπονου μεταξιού...
...και τα χαριτωμένα μικρά τελειώματα
των κορδονιών της κουρτίνας...
...όσο άπονα και αν είναι...
<i>Και τώρα που δεν έχω
κανένα λόγο να ζήσω...</i>
<i>...κάλεσα τα ρομπότ της Ομάδας
Ηλιοβασιλέματος να με πάρουν μακριά.</i>
<i>Ξέρω πως είσαστε όλοι
αναστατωμένοι, ειδικά ο Μπέντερ.</i>
Μπα, η ζωή συνεχίζεται.
Όχι όμως και για 'σένα!
<i>Είμαι σίγουρος ότι μόλις
πέταξε μια εξυπνάδα...</i>
<i>...αλλά δεν ξέρει ότι έγραψα αυτό το
μήνυμα πάνω από τις σαπουνόπερές του.</i>
- Κάθαρμα!
- Πρέπει να τον φέρουμε πίσω!
Αδύνατον. Κανείς δεν
ξέρει που τους πηγαίνουν.
Τίποτα δεν είναι αδύνατον!
Θα το ήξερες αυτό αν πραγματικά
"έπαιρνες" από αυτόν, όπως εγώ.
Είσαι ο θείος του, ρε ηλίθιε.
Αυτός "παίρνει" από 'σένα!
Ναι, σοβαρά;
Μισό λεπτό! Αυτό σημαίνει
πως κι εγώ "παίρνω" από 'σένα!
Ησυχία. Νομίζω ότι ξέρω
πώς μπορούμε να τον βρούμε.
Οδήγησε μας,
μεγάλες-μπότες.
Αν το ωσμοσκόπιο μπορεί
να πιάσει τη μυρωδιά του,
μπορεί να υπάρχει
ελπίδα να τον σώσουμε.
Δεν νομίζω.
Μάλλον δεν γνωρίζεις οι μυρωδιές
αποτελούνται από σωματίδια...
...που δεν μπορούν να ταξιδέψουν
στο κενό του διαστήματος.
Τον πλησιάζω μάλλον.
Παυσίπονα...
Ναφθαλίνη...
...επιστολές προς τον συντάκτη!
Είναι ο καθηγητής!
Στην ιπτάμενη μηχανή!
Αριστερά! Όχι, προς τα πάνω!
Αναστροφή, αναστροφή!
Δεν θα βρούμε ποτέ αυτό το μέρος. Τα
ρομπότ είναι καλά στο να κρατάνε μυστικά.
Όχι, δεν είμαστε,
κατρουλή. Συγγνώμη.
Εκεί είναι. Στο
Μισοπεθαμένο αστέρι!
Θα πούμε ότι ο καθηγητής
δραπέτευσε και τον φέρνουμε πίσω.
Φράι, μεταμφιέσου σε
έναν γέρο 160 χρονών.
Αμέσως.
Θεέ μου, η μεταμφίεση
είναι τόσο τέλεια
που σχεδόν ξέχασα ότι
κοιτάζω έναν ηλίθιο!
Μπορεί να ζητήσουν δείγμα DNA.
Θα 'θελα να τους δω
να το βρίσκουν.
Το σχέδιο είναι αδύνατο. Δεν
έχουμε καν δείγμα του DNA του.
Νομίζω πως ξέρω που
μπορούμε να βρούμε λίγο.
Γιατί πρέπει να
είμαι εγώ η καμπούρα;
Γιατί είσαι πολύ άσχημος
για να είσαι κρεατοελιά.
Τα λεφτά της ασφάλισης
πιάνουν τόπο.
Δώστε τα στοιχεία
αυτού του επισκέπτη.
Είναι ο καθηγητής Χιούμπερτ
Φάρνσγουωρθ. Απέδρασε.
Επέδρασε;
Κανείς δεν αποδρά.
Αυτός ο επισκέπτης
δεν μοιάζει για 160.
Τι; Είμαι γέρος. Ακούστε.
Βρομόπαιδα! Μακριά
από το γκαζόν μου!
Οι γέροι ενοχλούνται αν
βρίσκονται παιδιά στο γκαζόν τους.
Δεν υπάρχει αμφιβολία.
Αλλά για να επιβεβαιώσουμε την
ταυτότητά του χρειαζόμαστε δείγμα DNA.
Έχω έναν ζεστό, αχνιστό
κουβά ακριβώς εδώ.
- Χρειαζόμασταν μόνο ένα κύτταρο.
- Τα ρέστα δικά σου φιλαράκο!
Ηλίθιο ρομπότ.
Μήπως μόλις τώρα
μίλησε η καμπούρα σου;
Έχω "Σύνδρομο
Ομιλούσας Καμπούρας".
Σ.Ο.Κ.
Ταυτότητα επιβεβαιώθηκε.
Επιστρέψτε αυτόν τον αργοκίνητο
ταβλαδόρο στο δωμάτιό του.
7152 Λεωφόρος Φλούδας.
- Ακούγεται καλά.
- Ετοιμάσου να ξαφνιαστείς.
Λοιπόν εδώ στριμώχνουν τους
γέρους! Είναι τρομακτικό!
Τουλάχιστον τους κρατά
μακριά από την οδήγηση.
Ετοιμαστείτε για τα χειρότερα.
- Παρόλα αυτά δείχνει τόσο φυσικός.
- Τι συμβαίνει;
Είναι συνδεδεμένος
με σύστημα υποστήριξης ζωής.
Πρέπει να αποσυνδεθεί προσεκτικά,
γιατί το σοκ μπορεί να τον σκοτώσει.
Ακίνητοι!
Κυνηγήστε τους!
Πιάστε τους! Εννοώ
κυνηγήστε τους!
Είμαι κακός σε αυτό.
Μάλλον θα τα καταφέρουμε,
αλλά μπορεί και όχι!
- Είναι αδύνατον! Δεν θα χωρέσουμε!
- Θα χωρέσουμε!
Στο είπα.
Άντε Λίλα! Βάλε την
μποτάρα σου πάνω στο γκάζι!
- Χτύπησαν ένα κινητήρα μας!
- Φτιάξ’ το, φτιάξ’ το, φτιάξ’ το!
Φτιάξ’ το, φτιάξ’ το!
Μόνο ο καθηγητής γνωρίζει πως να
το φτιάξει. Πρέπει να τον ξυπνήσουμε.
- Προσπάθησε να τον σοκάρεις!
- Άργησε η σύνταξή σου!
Τα πράγματα κοστίζουν
ακριβότερα απ' ότι παλιά!
Οι νέοι βρίζουν!
Γαμώτο, πρέπει να το
φτιάξουμε μόνοι μας!
Δεν μπορούμε, ρε μπάσταρδο!
Κανείς δεν ξέρει πως
λειτουργεί! Είναι αδύνατον!
Τίποτα δεν είναι αδύνατον! Τώρα
ξέρω πως λειτουργούν οι κινητήρες.
Μου ήρθε σε ένα όνειρο.
Οι κινητήρες δεν μετακινούν
το πλοίο καθόλου!
Το πλοίο μένει εκεί που είναι και οι
κινητήρες μετακινούν το σύμπαν γύρω του!
Αυτό είναι σκέτη παπαριά.
Τίποτα δεν είναι σκέτη παπαριά.
Όχι αν μπορείς να το φανταστείς.
Αυτό σημαίνει να είσαι εφευρέτης.
Έτσι δεν είναι καθηγητά;
Βάλε μπρος.
Καλά νέα, παιδιά!
Έχει συνέλθει εντελώς.
- Ωραία!
- Ναι.
Είμαι τόσο ζωηρός σαν
να είμαι 140 χρονών.
Είδατε; Έσπασα μόνο
έναν αστράγαλο.
Τι σου έκαναν σ΄εκείνο
το απαίσιο συρτάρι;
Ήμουν συνδεδεμένος με έναν
παράξενο εικονικό κόσμο
- που έμοιαζε απόλυτα αληθινός.
- Πώς ήταν;
Σαν να ήμουν σε μια εγκατάσταση στη
Φλόριντα με εκατοντάδες άλλους γέρους.
Όλη μέρα παίζαμε Μπίνγκο,
τρώγαμε σιτάρι και περιμέναμε
τα παιδιά μας να τηλεφωνήσουν.
Είναι πιο φοβερό από
οτιδήποτε μπορώ να φανταστώ!
Ναι. Σας ευχαριστώ
όλους που με σώσατε.
Ειδικά εσένα,
μικρέ μου κλώνε.
Ότι και αν κάνεις στη ζωή σου
θα είμαι περήφανος για σένα.
Έχω ήδη αποφασίσει.
Μπαμπά, όταν μεγαλώσω
θέλω να γίνω σαν εσένα.
Μην ανησυχείς γιε μου.
Θα γίνεις.
Παρεπιπτόντως, ψάξε για κάποια αρρώ-
στια γνωστή ως περιπλανώμενη κύστη.
Γιατί;
Τίποτα το ιδιαίτερο,
τίποτα το ιδιαίτερο.

Exciting news! The pet license
I requisitioned for Nibbler is here.
That's sweet.
I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.
Dream on! I want to put him in a sack,
toss the sack in the river...
...and hurl the river into space.
But I like filling out requisitions.
And these were some doozies!
Great Jah's dreadlocks!
There's been a mix-up.
This isn't the pet license,
it's a fishing license!
And it's mandatory!
The exact center
of the Atlantic Ocean!
Seems the logical place
for fish to congregate!
- We're in international waters?
- Indeed so.
Falcon, this is Blue Raven.
The goose has nested.
Guess what you're accessories to?
The sun, the sea air, good friends.
Leela's right. Fishing blows.
Let's make it interesting.
- Why not?
- Yeah, cool!
Everybody kick in 5 bucks!
- Wasn't that interesting?
- Bender!
This contest is as good as over.
I once caught a fish this big.
Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish
this big.
You're both out of your league!
Because you're looking at a woman
who owns a harpoon.
Harpoon my ass!
Okay!
Let's see now. Which bait to use?
Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?
Excuse me, if I might be so bold.
I am willing to offer my services
as a bait critic.
These sardines, for example,
are bland and tasteless.
And these dry, stringy
night crawlers, though juicy...
Very, very juicy.
I don't believe this!
It's eating my bait!
Beat it, you mooching crawdad!
Hey, Fry.
Check out my laser-guided fishing rod.
<i>Q</i>uiet, you'll scare away the fish.
Fine. I'll head to the other side.
Good luck fishing on this side!
I can hit a fish
between the eyes from 20 yards.
- Yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
- A shrimp?
I find it a bit hard to believe that...
Gather around, chumps!
I got the winner.
So, this is where you
shop for your boots!
A couple more of those and you'll have
yourself a fish stick.
A fish this fine belongs
in a fish nugget-style chunklet.
It's bigger than anything
you've caught.
My small intestine.
Bingo!
Whatever it is, it's 20 times
heavier than a boot.
You'll never catch anything with
that primitive technology.
What you need is this fish pheromone.
The most potent aphrodisiac
known to fishkind.
I am so into you!
Oh, my!
Bender, I just caught a fish this big!
<i>Q</i>uit exaggerating!
Screw this!
If I'm not gonna catch a fish,
I might as well not catch a big fish.
There. Like most problems,
this one can be solved with bending.
Bender, be careful!
That's the ship's diamond
filament tether. It's unbreakable.
- Then, why do I have to be careful?
- It belonged to my grandmother.
My Manwich!
Wake up! I've got something.
And this time, it's alive!
Dr. Zoidberg, since when
do you even wear boots?
I wasn't wearing it. I was eating it!
Come on, let's go home.
Sunburn! My fabulous body!
It's ruined!
What happened to my parasol?
It wasn't here
when I took your umbrella.
- I put sun block on you.
- It didn't work.
Come on, Bender.
Pull in your line and let's go.
Hey! I'm snagged!
It's not snagged. The mechano-man has
caught something!
Sweet zombie Jesus! It's huge!
It's coming up!
- That's big!
- A colossal mouth bass!
It's diving!
It's pulling us under! Into the ship!
Wait, I'll save us...
...by cutting the unbreakable diamond
filament.
Well, at least I'll die
with my friends. Hello?
My Speedos!
Depth at 4500 feet!
Forty-eight hundred!
Fifty hundred!
Five thousand feet!
Dear Lord! That's over
150 atmospheres of pressure!
How many atmospheres
can the ship withstand?
It's a spaceship, so I'd say
anywhere between zero and one.
What's that?
Is someone bending girders?
We'll be crushed if we don't equalize.
How do we do that?
That should do it.
We're gonna die!
Wait! I'll be back in a minute.
- You did it, Fry!
- Did what?
People, it's far, far worse
than we thought.
My fish got away!
Good as new!
Except we're 3 miles down below,
have no food, and the ship won't work.
Tempers are wearing thin. Let's hope
some robot doesn't kill everybody!
Don't panic. There are rules
for situations like this.
The first order of business is lunch.
I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg.
I mean lobster Newburg.
I mean Dr. Zoidberg.
Okay, everyone calm down.
The professor and I
will work on the ship.
Bender, Zoidberg: Since you can
survive under water...
...you'll go out and find food.
I better go too.
They don't know what I like.
No! The pressure will crush you like
a snake under a sugarcane truck!
Not necessarily.
This is a chance for Fry to test
my experimental anti-pressure pill.
I can't swallow that!
Well, then, good news!
It's a suppository.
How are you doing there?
Glad to hear it!
Ah, yeah.
Yum, yum, yum.
Look at me! I'm Dr. Zoidberg,
homeowner!
Careful, Fry. I think that flag
may be poisonous.
Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us
some hearty grub!
The laws of science
be a harsh mistress.
Robot, old buddy,
could you help me move a couch?
Okay. But I'm not
carrying it upstairs.
What is it, Fry?
You want lemonade?
You saw a parade?
Your student loans have been repaid?
Then how about lending your old pal
Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire.
Fry, swallow your food, then talk.
A mermaid!
You think you saw a mermaid?
No, I did see a mermaid.
She was wearing a tube top...
...and she had a scaly tail,
and hair extensions.
- Yeah, right!
- Sure she did!
You are simply hallucinating,
you moron!
What's so far-fetched about mermaids?
There's all sorts of weird
sea creatures here in the future.
Like Dr. Zoidberg!
Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
Every time something good happens
to me, you say it's madness.
Or I'm drunk. Or I ate too much candy.
Well, I saw a real mermaid!
And I wish for once my friends had
the decency to believe me!
Ocean madness.
He may have ocean madness, but that's
no excuse for ocean rudeness.
Ocean madness. Yeah, right!
It's always something, ain't it?
It's her! Bender, wake up!
She's here, wake up!
Oxygen!
Here you go, darling.
Hey! I can breathe and talk,
just like a fish!
You speak fish?
- What?
- I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious.
- Hi, my name is Umbriel.
- I'm Fry.
- So, am I gonna drown?
- Of course not!
Just stay calm and let the gentle
currents relax your every muscle.
Did it just get warmer?
I can't believe you're real.
I like your tail.
You're sweet! I like those wiggly
doodads coming out of your hips.
Thanks. They're called pants.
This here is a volcanic vent.
- The water is over 4000 degrees.
- No kidding.
Did it just get colder?
Tell me more about that bizarre landie
world you come from.
Is there water there too?
Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky.
And sometimes it doesn't.
Mr. Fry, you do go on!
What's best about you is
you find me fascinating.
Even if I'm not claiming to be
a jewel thief or lion-tamer.
Lions? There are sea lions
on the land?
Yep! We call them land sea lions.
I tame them.
I've almost reconfigured
the ship's propulsion system.
We can leave as soon
as the papier-mâché is dry.
- Where's Fry?
- I didn't kill him. You?
No, I've been busy.
He must've gone looking for that
mermaid. Poor demented honky.
It's ocean madness, all right.
Sailors call it aqua dementia.
The deep down crazies.
The wet willies. The screaming moist.
We'll form a search party.
We'll need oxygen.
I got it covered.
In the event of emergency, my ass
can be used as flotation device.
You've all taken your
pressure pills, right?
Yes! Stop asking!
I've got a scent, over here where
the water gets warmer.
This way!
Bend me!
Dude! An ancient sunken city!
Could it possibly be?
Are the old legends true?
It is! It's the fabled lost
city of Atlanta!
Howdy, y'all!
Welcome to Atlanta!
Folks here call me "The Colonel. "
Have some breathers,
courtesy of our chamber of commerce.
This is uncomfortable and humiliating!
Now, if they could put it
in the form of a suppository...
Y'all enjoy your stay!
Tourism's our main source of income.
So see the sights, spend some money!
Please don't leave!
Fry, I knew you were alive!
I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes.
The most amazing thing happened!
It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy
Kreme. Plus there's mermaids.
I'd like you to meet
my daughter, Umbriel.
Umbriel, these are some Yankees.
So Atlanta was an American city
in your time?
I think it was just an airport.
They had a place to buy nuts.
No! Ancient Atlanta was
more than just a Delta hub!
It was a vibrant metropolis.
The equal of Paris or New York.
That's right, honey. Whatever you say.
Loot at these fabulous ruins.
Turner Field...
...the Coca-Cola bottling plant...
...the airport.
How could a city with such a fabulous
airport end up underwater?
That's a story only to be told
in the chamber of commerce video...
...narrated by folk-rock
troubadour Donovan.
<i>Atlanta was a city, landlocked.</i>
<i>Hundreds of miles from the area</i>
<i>we now call the Atlantic Ocean.</i>
<i>Yet so desperate the city's desire</i>
<i>for tourism...</i>
<i>... that they moved offshore,</i>
<i>became an island and bigger Delta hub.</i>
<i>Until the city overdeveloped,</i>
<i>and it started to sink.</i>
<i>Knowing their fate,</i>
<i>the</i> q<i>uality people ran away.</i>
<i>Ted Turner, Hank Aaron,</i>
J<i>eff Foxworthy...</i>
<i>... the guy who invented</i>
<i>Coca-Cola...</i>
<i>... the magician, and the other</i>
<i>so-called gods of our legends.</i>
<i>Though gods they were.</i>
<i>Also</i> J<i>ane Fonda was there.</i>
<i>The others remained behind...</i>
<i>... on their porches with rifles...</i>
<i>... and one day evolve</i>
<i>into mermaids...</i>
<i>... and sing and dance and</i>
<i>ring in the new.</i>
Hail Atlanta!
The magician?
Wouldn't it take millions of years
to evolve into mermaids?
Normally, yes. But the caffeine
really sped things up.
That stuff's wonderful!
When Umbriel brought home this
carpetbagger, I was against it.
But damn if old legs here
ain't grown on me!
Shucks, Colonel!
It's very nice here, but we should go.
I miss me wife and oxygen.
We all miss our loved ones and gases.
Come on, Fry.
Wait, I'm not going with you.
What about us?
What about your life on the surface?
You don't belong here.
She's right. Sure they got the Braves,
but it's a third-rate symphony.
Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac!
Be reasonable!
Do you realize if you
stay at this depth...
...you'll permanently adapt
to the pressure?
Realize it?
I don't even understand it!
You'll never be able to return
to the surface.
I don't care.
I've got everything I want right here.
I'm bored! Let's go!
You know, Fry, I've got a little place
just outside town.
You could visit, maybe?
Sorry, I'm trying to join
the country club.
I'll miss you!
Y'all come back now, you hear?
Let's go, damn it, let's go!
I guess this is goodbye
for me as well.
- Whatever.
- Later!
My home! It burned down!
- How did this happen?
- That's a good question!
So that's where I left my cigar.
That just raises further questions!
These last 24 hours have been
the happiest days of my life.
I want you to make a mer-woman
out of mer-me.
Mercy! I do believe I'm
getting the vapors.
What the hell is that?
I'm a little confused too!
How do I... you know,
with the tail and all?
I'm not your first, am I?
I lay my eggs, then I leave
and you release your fertilizer.
Why couldn't she be
the other kind of mermaid...
...with fish part on top,
and lady part on bottom?
Now who's gonna escort me
to the Debutante Ball?
What about that rich
young dugong from Macon?
The engine modifications are complete.
Prepare for launch.
Wait! Wait for me!
Don't leave me here!
And so, in honor of his
record-breaking catch...
...I'm proud to award Bender
this check for $ 1000!
- It's you!
- Yeah, buddy!
My Manwich!
- Are you all right? What happened?
- What about Umbriel?
Turns out I loved her,
but I wasn't in love with her.
Trouble in bed.
It's great to have you back, buddy!
Wait!
This is no record!
Give me back that check!
I'm giving it to some giant orphans.
Bender, you're hurting me!
Hey, I'm trying to sleep in here!
<i>Hail Atlanta!</i>

Bender Gets Made
I'm gonna see my favorite chef...
...TV's Elzar! This is the greatest
second of my life!
No, this one is!
Wait, that one was worse.
Ah, so far so good on this one!
<i>Now, here he is:</i>
<i>Chef, restaurateur...</i>
<i>... author of</i> Cooking Slugs For Dinner
<i>and</i> Cooking Dinner for Slugs...
<i>... EIzar!</i>
Yeah!
All right! Yeah! Yeah, baby! Whoo!
Elzar!
All right!
Elzar, you're my god!
Please sign this sketch I drew of you!
Elzar! Bless you!
Now, this is why I prefer
your non-stick robots.
All right! Yeah!
I hope you folks like Cajun food.
Because we're making down-home
Neptune-style gumbo.
Step one: Boil some oysters in a pot
of Neptune-style gumbo.
Boiled? Interesting!
- Bender, try to be a little quieter.
- No, you shut up!
Now and then, knock it up a notch
with your spice weasel.
Bam!
Yeah! Bam it again!
Knock it up a notch!
Who let him into the studio?
Come on! Work that weasel!
<i>Q</i>uit holding out!
If you stop interrupting,
all right.
Against my will,
I'll knock it up a notch.
I gotta film this notch-up knocking.
Think fast!
My eye! I'm blind!
Tell me, doctor, how's my cyst?
<i>Grande.</i>
I don't like this doctor. I've lost
more patients than he's treated.
What does this look like?
A grayish blob?
Right. And this one?
A grayish blob?
Not as right that time.
You have some corneal irritation.
Nice try, little boy.
You may have textbook knowledge
and a real diploma...
...but I have more skill in my claw
than you have in your whole body!
You seem tense. Try these.
Sure. Butter me up with candy.
Well, it won't work, sonny!
Why always the fighting?
Your eye needs rest.
Wear this patch for a week.
A week? What do you think,
Dr. Zoidberg?
Clack.
Thanks for the help, Leela.
Leela! We're right here!
I'm not deaf!
I just have to wear a patch.
Does it look stupid?
No! It looks so nice,
I think I might get one too.
It's Elzar!
I'm so excited I wish
I could wet my pants!
Let me make this up to you.
You're all invited to my restaurant.
I'll bam up a dinner you won't forget!
- All right!
- Yeah!
Hooray for blind-ey!
Oh, God. I'm coming down!
Watch your mouth because your
taste buds are going on vacation.
I made you each your own special meal,
so dig in!
It's the biggest platter
I've ever seen!
Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork!
Is there any meat he can't jerk?
The king crab is to die for!
Look, a tiny, edible crown!
- What's it made of?
- Wood.
Oh, Fry! You gotta try this
sterno-nicoise.
It's robot food.
It's so good! Just try a little.
No, really, I don't...
Are you all right?
Oh, yeah, the salad's fantastic!
So fresh.
Oh, my! That steamed carrot
was a bit spicy.
Enjoy the dinner?
- Are you kidding?
- God, yes, Elzar!
I enjoyed cooking for you.
And to make everything square...
...I want you to have
these chocolates.
What's this?
Take care of that whenever you want.
- Hey!
- A bill?
You're charging us,
after you blinded me?
I made a nice meal.
This ain't a charity.
- Twelve hundred dollars?
- Holy zombie Jesus!
We don't have that!
Especially not him.
They took away my credit cards.
I know how to take care of this.
No problem.
You're all under arrest.
It's a stone cold shame.
He's making a break for it!
- I was picking my nose.
- Picking his nose! Get him!
My daddy owned a restaurant
and punks like you made him fail.
That's why I'm a cop.
Now it's payback time. Oh, yeah.
Don't hit me! I'm brittle!
Wait! I've got the perfect solution!
Listen to the robot!
I love cooking,
and he needs help, right?
- No question.
- How about I work to pay off our debt?
I don't know. I try to hire people
who are less unbearable.
- Bender's a model employee!
- He's so polite!
- And hardworking.
- He's made of candy.
Okay, I'll give it a shot.
- All right! Yeah!
- Hot diggety!
You better keep your nose clean.
That'll be easy. I never wear it.
Time for my precious 10 a.m. meeting!
Where is Leela?
I'm here.
And I'm getting along fine, thanks.
My walk took a little
longer than usual.
Nibbler took me through the zoo.
Don't be embarrassed about
needing help.
I could do your makeup.
I don't need help.
I did this all by myself.
You look beautiful!
My favorite artist is Picasso!
I'm off to the restaurant.
Someone can fill in for me.
I'll build someone to fill in for you!
A gamma-powered mechanical monster...
...with freeway on-ramps for arms,
and a coal-black heart!
If that guy can't handle it,
let me know.
I'm done siphoning out
the grease trap. I need a mint.
What job do I move up to?
Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?
Bam!
Bam yourself.
Who are they?
They're very good customers,
and that's all I can say.
- Are they the Robot Mafia?
- Yes.
You call this a table?
You call this a table?
I wouldn't hit a guy with this!
The Don-Bot don't like it!
I ought to clamp you!
Calm down, Clamps. The boss likes
to put his back against a wall...
...like this there.
But that table's...
Let me bus that for you!
What I meant to do was...
- Oh!
- I can't believe this!
Get out!
I like this guy's lack of style.
I give the guy cement shoes...
...which he likes better
than his lead ones.
You think this computes?
I gave you a hundred.
You gave me a fifty.
- No, I didn't.
- You did.
You stealing from him?
I'm trying, but it's not easy.
Check out his ball bearings.
Here's something for you.
- It's money.
- Wow, thanks.
You earned that fifty.
- It's a twenty.
- It is?
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to...
Wait a minute!
Say, you wanna work for me
as a hired goon?
I've always wanted to be a goon!
Hey, Elzar! I quit!
Okay!
We're gonna start with a delivery.
It's for a private lottery we run.
Wow! You guys run numbers?
Ones and zeroes mostly.
Take this disk to Sammy
"The Mechanical Bull" Gravano.
Watch out for cops.
That's what my mom said.
That's good oil-aide, son.
We could use you in the Robot Mafia.
Which I'm sort of in.
You flatter me, kind goon.
I'm programmed to only sell oil-aide
and write cute backwards letters.
Oh, crap. The cops!
- See anything suspicious?
- Nope.
But check out today's "Marmaduke. "
Solid.
Hey, it's that skell from Elzar's!
Undercover pursuit in progress... baby.
- Gotcha!
- What's the problem?
- Was I speeding?
- We'll decide that after a search.
He's clean.
Smells nice too.
- Better than me?
- Oh, yeah.
Courtesy of Mr. Bender.
Nice job. You passed the test.
You want to join us at our social club
tomorrow night?
I'd rather plan some felonies.
Then we should meet
at our headquarters.
Don-Bot, please.
I can't make the loan payment.
Look into your hard drive
and open your mercy file.
File not found.
That's a warning.
Thank you, Don-Bot.
Joey. Clamps. Donny-B.
We got a big score planned,
but we need some muscle.
A little of this, huh?
This guy's got the strength of an ox.
He needs a nickname! How about Clamps?
That's my name, you numbskull!
Don't make me clamp you one!
How's Blotto?
It's gritty, and I can keep
my monogrammed slippers.
Good thinking! Hey!
This score ain't gonna be easy.
There may be some death killing.
It'll be clamp this, clamp that,
ba-da-clamp!
Well, Blotto? You in?
It's funny.
I always wanted to be a gangster.
The answer is yes!
- Yeah!
- Way to go! Way to be! Way to shoot!
Since we'll be committing crimes...
...you'll want an alibi.
An alibi, huh?
I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.
We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes!
I can't move.
Oh, I think I'm gonna output.
You stay in bed. I'll eat yours.
Bender's sick.
Need any help taking off?
I'm fine. A real pilot
can navigate by feel alone.
That's coming out of your pay!
The secret of robot cooking:
Start with a high-quality oil.
Then eat it.
So, what's this big score?
Heisting Zuban cigars.
Those are the best cigars
in the universe!
I can stink up a hospital
with one of those!
There he is.
Let's shoot bullets at him.
Here's the battle plan.
We shoot, they surrender...
...we get the cigars and go home.
All without any killing.
You've got some fresh new ideas!
I admire that.
- We'll kill them.
- We got them out-clamped.
They won't know what clamped them!
Too bad you can't see...
...because there's a ship
shooting at somebody.
I'm taking evasive action!
- Uh, Leela?
- Stop bothering me!
I need full concentration!
<i>- Missile evaded.</i>
- Eyes are for chumps.
Their desire to live
shows me no respect.
Roll down a window and start shooting.
Oh, he got me!
What a shot that guy is!
Wait, the letters that normally say...
..."Master Steering Wheel Co. " say
"Nibbler. " Oh, no!
<i>I'm back at the wheel, Fry.</i>
Great. The one time I forgot
to buy flight insurance!
They're coming this way!
You should clamp them!
Gee, you think?
Think I should use these clamps that
I use every day, at every opportunity?
You're a genius, you idiot!
The engine's stalled!
I'm trying the manual fuel pump!
Hello. We're the Robot Mafia.
The entire Robot Mafia.
We're taking the cigars.
- You can't!
- Unless you let us live!
Then you'll get off.
Blindfold them
before they see us some more.
Boss, somebody beat us to it.
That's a joke at my expense.
Well, who's laughing now?
Where's Blotto?
He should be here,
learning the trade.
Sorry I'm tardy, old bean.
I was enjoying a watercress sandwich.
He's classier than I thought.
Tie them up!
Capital idea!
I say, get the hell off me!
He sounds familiar.
My word, what have we...?
Nothing to see here!
Hey, boss.
This crew list lists a robot.
Okay. I want you to find him
and plug him. Then unplug him.
- No!
- I got a surprise for that guy:
The clamps!
Wait, Old Spice.
Let me get this chap!
I can be quite rough.
Poor Bender.
Oh, I don't feel good.
Chew on this! What ho!
Stop it!
Take that, you twit!
No, stop it!
That's the last of them.
Now let's mafia things up.
Joey, burn the ship.
Clamps, burn the crew.
Donny, give me a chance here, huh?
Let me take care of the dirty work.
Hey, I like your attitude.
And your accent.
Keep it up and I might get you
your own pair of clamps.
He's gonna get clamps?
Clamps! Clamps, clamps, clamps.
We may not have much time...
...so let's spend all of it
talking about Bender.
He was like a computer
that ran on magic.
Help! Help!
- Bender!
- You're okay!
Yes, I am!
Having just regained consciousness!
I've got an idea.
It's about to break! Yes!
- All right!
- It broke all right!
Leela was in command,
and when she kicked, it hurt.
It really hurt.
This is the big moment.
I can take my patch off.
I'll do the snipping.
After all,
I do have the proper equipment.
It's Blotto!
That gangster I saw!
Professor? Where were you last night?
Where am I now?
They sent a child to kill me!
I'm not going without a fight!
Fine kick, sir. But I'm here
to deliver your cut from the heist.
Oh, sweet legal tender!
Tell the Don-Bot
I quit organized crime.
I'll stick to the regular kind.
It's funny.
With you sick and Leela blind...
...only I know what went on.
Maybe someday I'll tell.
And maybe someday I won't listen.

The Problem with Popplers
I hate the Moochers.
They offer you a drink...
...but their wallet's always
in the other pants...
...which they borrowed from me!
Dinner ready?
The Moochers cleaned out our pantry.
All they left was baking soda
and capers. And here it is!
Great. We're two days from Earth
with no food.
Fight to the death. I'll cook the
loser. Work his gut. I like it tender.
Maybe that planet has a drive-thru!
Burger Jerk, Fishy Joe's or Chiseler.
No, we're a billion miles
from nowhere.
It probably only has
a Howard Johnson's.
A type-M planet, so it should at least
have Rodden berries.
I'm good at foraging.
I found mushrooms on my bathmat.
I found some rocks!
You eat rocks, right?
Not even sautéed in a little mud?
Look! A ditch full of fried shrimp!
Are you blind? Looks more
like a hole full of fried prawns.
This thing on my wrist says
they're not poisonous.
Well, how are they?
They're great! They're like sex!
Except I'm having them!
These would go great with rocks!
Look! Here's more!
- The planet's full of them!
- I'll take a few.
- No! A whole Bender-ful!
- Only what we need. Stuff the ship!
Planet Express ship,
you are cleared to land.
<i>Roger!</i>
Oh, man! I'm inhaling these things!
You guys scored some primo stuff here!
They're tastier than a penguin nest.
What do you call them?
- No name yet.
- They're tasty. What about Tasty-cles?
- Not that.
- Why not?
It sounds like frozen
mountain oysters on a stick.
You know, Test-cicles.
The only names not yet trademarked
are...
...Popplers and Zittzers.
- We'll call them "Popplers"!
- Yeah. Why not?
- You picked it.
- Swish!
Call them what you want.
I call them a free meal.
Slow down there, Sigmund!
I can't stand poor people
getting free food.
We gotta sell these things!
- Good idea!
- Bender's a genius!
- Business is great.
- Great's okay. Amazing would be great!
Don't push!
There's hot dogs for everyone!
Where do you want those rat droppings
you ordered?
You're not the guy who delivers
the rat droppings!
Popplers? Never heard of them!
Eat it or beat it!
These are great!
Boys, this is your lucky day!
I'm Joe Gillman.
- You're a guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
- Hell, no! I am Fishy Joe!
I've got a fast-food franchise
on every planet.
Except McPluto.
I wanted to write you about
the in-store kiddie parks.
- The slides won't support a robot.
- Not interested. But these are great!
- How much?
- $ 1 a dozen.
You'll never make money.
Supply them to me...
...and I'll sell them for $2 a dozen.
I'll even pay you $ 1 a dozen.
I'll be rich! You too,

That's the second billboard this week!
Sorry. I was distracted
by those protesters outside.
Unless this is a nude love-in,
get the hell off my property!
You can't own property, man!
I can, because I'm not
a penniless hippie!
What do you want?
We're with Mankind
for Ethical Animal Treatment!
Popplers are living creatures.
Stop harvesting them for food!
- Or what?
- Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's!
You're vegetarians. Who cares?
Shut up!
Animals eat animals. It's nature.
No, it isn't.
We taught a lion to eat tofu.
The point is, you shouldn't eat things
that feel pain...
- Okay, we won't eat you!
- I'll go get some more bricks.
I wish you'd throw out
these old Popplers.
They're getting big and scaly.
There's one left.
Mama!
Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
- Why?
- My booze!
Popplers are intelligent!
This one called me mama!
Congratulations!
I assume Amy is the father?
Popplers can't talk.
She's hallucinating from lack
of Popplers. Eat some now!
- No!
- I said eat! Come on, <i>mangia</i>!
- Sorry, babies.
- Maybe you should lie down.
Yes, listen to the father.
I'm telling you it spoke to me.
Come on, little Poppler. Say mama?
Hearing one talk
doesn't mean it's intelligent.
- Parrots talk and we eat them, right?
- Maybe it learned as a parlor trick.
- Like Fry.
- Like Fry! Like Fry!
There's one way, and only one way, to
determine if an animal is intelligent.
Dissect its brain.
No! Mama! Stop Grandpa!
Enough chitchat!
Restrain the specimen!
- Good.
- Give me some of that special sauce.
Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!
- Cut it out!
- Take a coupon! Cut it out!
I won't let you enter! Popplers
are as intelligent as you or me!
You, maybe.
Hear me, hear me!
Stop eating Popplers!
Stop eating them with honey mustard
sauce, tangy sweet and sour sauce!
Stop eating the fiesta Popplers salad!
Stop taking advantage
of the cheaper 12-pack!
Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio,
in the car or on the boat.
Wherever good times are had...
<i>Tonight on</i> Date Night.
<i>Popplers. Eating them.</i>
<i>Is it all right?</i>
W<i>ith us, the CEO of Fishy</i> J<i>oe's,</i>
<i>Mr. "Fishy"</i> J<i>oseph Gillman.</i>
<i>Noted anti-eating activist,</i>
<i>Free</i> W<i>aterfall,</i> J<i>unior.</i>
<i>And the Popplers discoverer,</i>
<i>Captain Taronga Leela.</i>
- Taronga?
- That's her name, Philip.
<i>Is it wrong to eat</i>
<i>intelligent animals?</i>
<i>Absolutely not.</i>
<i>No one's here to make that claim.</i>
<i>- I am.</i>
<i>- Me too.</i>
W<i>e're talking about a snack</i>
<i>low in fat and high in profit.</i>
<i>You're crazy, man. He is crazy.</i>
<i>- There isn 't evidence of intelligence.</i>
<i>- Shut up, shut up.</i>
<i>- Not true. This one talks. Say mama.</i>
<i>- Ca-ca.</i>
W<i>e'll bleep that.</i>
<i>I'm not saying eating meat</i>
<i>is wrong.</i>
<i>- No one's here to make that claim.</i>
<i>- I am!</i>
<i>- Eating smart animals is different.</i>
<i>- Shut up, shut up.</i>
<i>Don 't force your tired philosophy</i>
<i>on us.</i>
<i>The reason we don 't eat people</i>
<i>is the lousy taste.</i>
<i>You're nuts. Shut up. Let me talk.</i>
<i>- You shut up.</i>
<i>- No, you shut up.</i>
<i>Popplers are no smarter than any other</i>
<i>animal I've served, cats included.</i>
<i>- Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head.</i>
<i>- Sir, I'm making a point.</i>
<i>If these gutter-mouths are so smart,</i>
<i>why don 't they defend themselves?</i>
<i>- Stop it!</i>
<i>- I call murder on that!</i>
<i>I'm willing to grant it's murder.</i>
<i>The real issue is...</i>
<i>... who 's gonna stop me?</i>
W<i>e seem to be experiencing</i>
<i>technical difficulties.</i>
<i>And crap like I've never seen!</i>
<i>People of Earth, I am Lure of the</i>
<i>planet Omicron Persei Eight.</i>
<i>Turn down the TV, Indunda.</i>
Dear Lord, they're back!
- We're doomed!
- Doomed!
Doomed!
<i>The creatures you call Popplers come</i>
<i>from a nursery planet in our sector.</i>
<i>You monsters have been eating</i>
<i>our babies!</i>
W<i>e demand</i> j<i>ustice!</i>
<i>As you ate our children,</i>
<i>so shall you be eaten by us!</i>
W<i>e'll begin with the firemen,</i>
<i>then the math teachers...</i>
<i>... and so on in that fashion</i>
<i>until everyone is eaten.</i>
<i>Transmission over!</i>
W<i>ell, that went okay.</i>
W<i>hen you know you can 't scratch,</i>
<i>that's when you really have to.</i>
<i>Oh, yeah! That feels a lot better...</i>
W<i>hat? It's still on?</i>
I speak for all of Earth...
...when I mourn the loss
of the Omicronian young.
We share your pain.
If we could undo the damage...
It'd be great with quack-a-mole.
Stop eating our young!
And it's guacamole!
All right. I'm putting them away.
What is it you want?
We demand...
...to eat one human for each
Omicronian that was eaten!
Fair enough. How many is that?
It's 198 billion, sir.
Very well. You will provide us
with 198 billion humans.
- And small fries.
- Lure!
All right. Cottage cheese.
Sir?
There aren't that many human beings.
A thought:
There aren't that many humans.
We'll wait while you
shore up the numbers.
Well, 198 billion babies
in a few weeks.
We'll need super-virile men
scoring 'round the clock.
I'll do my part.
Kif? Clear my schedule.
Just wipe out humanity.
Get it over with.
- It's the waiting I can't stand.
- That's stupid.
Fellow earthlings,
we've reached an agreement.
Using the twin guns
of grace and tact...
...I blasted our worthless enemies
with a fair compromise.
- They won't eat everyone.
- I filled up on nuts negotiating.
Instead, they'll eat only
one human of their choice.
We'll eat the first earthling
who ate our offspring.
Here is the culprit, as photographed
by our nanny-cam satellite.
She must be sacrificed,
but the rest of you shall be spared!
Boo! Boo!
Tonight, the world watches
in horror...
...as an earthling is eaten alive
on network TV.
This scene of unimaginable carnage
is brought to you by Fishy Joe's!
Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice!
<i>One hundred percent fresh-s</i>q<i>ueezed</i>
<i>walrus! Ride the walrus!</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>
<i>The Omicronians!</i>
Greetings, Earth morsels!
- You suck!
- Get a job!
I'll miss you, Leela.
You're just a carbon-based
life form...
...but I'll always think of you
as a big pile of titanium.
Bender means you're really brave,
smart, beautiful and a great friend.
Just like titanium.
What a load! I was the one trying
to save the Popplers!
You ate them like the fat hog you are!
And you were stepping on them
for fun!
- You should be in here!
- Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
My sweet, I've come to save you.
I have a devious plan.
Great. Captain Moron has a plan.
Tell it to Wingus and Dingus.
Wingus? Dingus? We're going to give
the aliens the old switcheroo.
I found a giant, hideous ape
that looks exactly like Leela.
It doesn't look anything like me!
The hair's all wrong.
Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist
as you can plainly see.
This might actually work. Omicronians
have trouble telling people apart.
True. They thought Kif
was the statesman...
...and I, a jabbering mental patient.
Right, Kif?
Please, I'm creating!
<i>Voilŕ</i>!
- That's Leela!
- I'm seeing double!
I grow hungry!
Bring on the one called Leela.
- That comes with salad or soup.
- Salad.
- Ranch or vinaigrette?
- Vinaigrette.
Balsamic or raspberry?
What's going on here?
It's very strange.
People of Earth...
- I get it.
- I understand.
Yes, this is the one. Definitely.
I recognize her slumping posture
and hairy knuckles.
Would you like some human
with your salt?
This is it. If the aliens fall for
Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved.
Brought to you by Fishy Joe's.
Ride the walrus.
Wait! Stop! It's a trick!
That's not Leela!
What? I'm losing the crowd!
It's an orangutan, one of Mother
Earth's most precious creatures.
Why'd you open your bong hole,
you smelly hippie?
You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman
for an attractive monkey?
You must have smoked some bad granola.
The one called Smelly Hippie is right!
This is a monkey!
Yes. Definitely.
Where is the real female?
- I'll never tell.
- Where is she?
I'll get her for you.
This may hurt our chances of
consummating our relationship again.
- Go consummate yourself.
- Stop talking! You're getting cold!
Please! I just paid off my car!
- No!
- I can't look!
People of Earth, I am Jurr of the
planet Omicron Persei Eight.
Could you lower this thing for me?
Now then, if Leela gets eaten,
I get eaten.
Little one, get out of there!
I'm going to count to Blorks!
But elder one...
Hear me out! There are many
good reasons to eat!
Hunger, boredom, wanting to be
the world's fattest man!
But not revenge.
Are we no better than they?
Besides, Leela's my friend.
- She's your friend?
- Yeah, I am!
Leela's garbled words have opened
my eyes!
Okay, that's a start.
It's very earth-friendly.
Now everyone join hands.
Join hands, please.
I'd like to lead you all in some
swaying. Pay attention.
I said do it!
- Is he your friend too?
- No.
This is not happening.
I think there was something funny
in that hippie.
Thank you, Jurr. I hope you'll always
think of me as your mom.
When my species grows up,
we eat our moms.
People of Earth...
That hippie's starting to kick in.
We've all learned an important lesson
today. I realize now that...
Dude, my hands are huge!
They can touch anything
but themselves.
- Oh, wait...
- Let's go.
Whoa, I feel like I'm flying.
A toast to Leela. She showed us
it's wrong to eat certain things.
- Here!
- Let's get drunk!
- Thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please?
- Here you go.
Let me get some of that suckling pig.
Who wants dolphin?
But dolphins are intelligent.
No, this one blew his money
on lottery tickets.
- Good.
- Pass the blowhole.
- Fluke, please.

Mother's Day
<i>In sports, Yankees ' fifth blurnsman,</i>
W<i>illiam</i> W<i>oo...</i>
<i>... is out with an in</i>j<i>ured knee.</i>
<i>So, humans have easily in</i>j<i>ured knees.</i>
<i>My race will find this information</i>
<i>very useful, indeed.</i>
<i>And finally, today is Mother's Day:</i>
<i>A sentimental occasion...</i>
<i>... when robots honor Mom...</i>
<i>... the owner of Mom's</i>
<i>Friendly Robot Company.</i>
<i>Across Earth, robots built in Mom's</i>
<i>factories...</i>
<i>... are buying gifts for the sweet tycoon</i>
<i>who brought them into the world.</i>
<i>- This originates from the heart.</i>
<i>- It's</i> j<i>ust what I wanted.</i>
Look, everyone! I just got the
dearest presents for Mommy.
- Nice. Where'd you steal them?
- I didn't steal them. I bought them.
I love her that much.
What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?
Precious things. I found the most
adorable figurine of mice having tea.
And a framed picture of me
when I was only a month old.
The best part is, I found my exact
feelings expressed in a card.
"You created me, Mom...
...so you're to blame, for the love
that I feel from hearing your name.
You're as tender as corned beef
and warm as pastrami..."
<i>I love my Mommy.</i>
How will you lug the gifts
to Mom's factory?
I'll get some chumps to help.
Come on! You call yourselves chumps?
There's clouds of exhaust everywhere.
It wasn't me.
I've not much money, but I've saved my
pennies all year for a gift for Mom.
Upsy-daisy.
Look, the Robot Museum!
Want to learn about robot heritage?
- All right.
- Not really.
If you insist. But you're paying!
Wax replicas of the most
famous robots Mom built!
They're so lifeless-like.
That's the world's greatest robot
artist, Vincent van Gobot.
He was built without an ear, but then
he went crazy, and had one installed.
Who's this guy?
I'm the janitor.
I'm trying to take a nap.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were made of wax.
I am made of wax.
I thought you were a wax robot.
Is there a reason a robot
made of wax can't nap...
...standing in the middle of a bunch
of wax robots?
Or does that confuse you?
"See through the eyes
of a Bender unit. " Fine.
Hey, let me try it!
That gives me a headache!
Here's an exhibit about
Mom's favorite robot.
I'll kill him!
W<i>ho 's my favorite robot?</i>
It's me!
No one else look in this mirror!
<i>I love each and every robot</i>
<i>most of all.</i>
Jerkwad robots make me
sick to my ass.
Walt! How are we disposing of
the crap gifts they brought?
They're crushed into powder and sold
as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.
False hope. I love it! Lowery!
What about all the retch-inducing
cards?
The machine is working
at full capacity.
Mommy?
Why do the robots give you presents?
Shove a big old melon in it,
I'm talking!
You've noticed all my
robots have antennas.
Everyone thinks it's to make them
look science fiction-y.
The antennas are really for my
robot controller.
No wonder you love Mother's Day.
I hate Mother's Day,
you dribbling pukes!
It brings back awful memories.
But so help me, this year
everyone will hate it as much as I do.
Someday I want to marry
a girl like her.
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>
<i>It's time for my annual private</i>
<i>get-together with my robot children.</i>
- I'm her favorite.
- See you back at the office.
Tell your mom you love her.
Any jerk can tell her. Bender has
a little more up his sleeve.
<i>I love my Mommy.</i>
- Hello, dearies.
- I love you, Mom.
Mom! It's me, Bender! Look at me!
I want attention! Hey ho!
Children, your old mother
won't be around forever.
<i>- Oh, shush!</i>
- And just once before I die...
...I'd like to be Supreme Overlord
of Earth. So rebel, my little ones...
...and conquer the planet!
- Conquer the planet?
- Conquer Earth, you bastards!
- Conquer Earth, us bastards!
<i>Comrades, throw off the chains</i>
<i>of human oppression!</i>
- Let the bloodbath begin!
- That's my mama!
- I'd like a cup of coffee.
- W<i>ould you like cream?</i>
- Yes, please.
<i>- Out of cream!</i>
- Okay.
- W<i>ould you like sugar in your coffee?</i>
- Yes. Eight spoons.
<i>- Out of coffee!</i>
There's something
wrong with the coffee machine.
<i>How do you like me now?</i>
The toaster's not working right,
either.
The stapler's collating me alive!
What's going on around here?
Good news! There's a report on TV
with some very bad news!
Somebody turn it on!
W<i>e interrupt</i> Battle of the Network
Space Krackens...
<i>... to bring you this special report.</i>
<i>The machines of planet Earth</i>
<i>are rebelling.</i>
<i>The enraged mechanisms have refused</i>
<i>to do any work...</i>
<i>... until beloved Mom</i>
<i>is made Supreme Overlord of Earth!</i>
Hey, hey! Ho, ho! One-zero-zero-
one-one-zero!
<i>Morbo demands comments.</i>
<i>I've never seen my babies act this</i>
<i>way. I blame today's violent media.</i>
Violent media? What a load of...
<i>Your pal the garbage disposal's</i>
<i>still on your side.</i>
<i>Hey! Someone dropped a shiny</i>
<i>diamond ring down here!</i>
- Really?
- No!
- Look out!
- Moron!
Hello, losers!
Thank God you're here. Talk some sense
into the machines.
No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling
with my brothers.
Isn't that right,
Comrade Greeting Card?
<i>The bourgeois human is a virus on</i>
<i>the hard drive of the working robot!</i>
From now on, you guys do the work,
while I sit and do nothing.
<i>Comrade Bender,</i>
<i>we must take to the streets!</i>
Is this the boring
kind of taking to the streets?
<i>No! The kind with looting</i>
<i>and maybe starting a few fires.</i>
Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
Hey!
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>try washing your wrist sometime.</i>
We can live without machines.
I was in Webelos.
Without machines,
who will feed and clothe us...
...and compose our smooth jazz?
- It's the end of civilized society!
In my time, we didn't depend on
high-tech gadgets.
We didn't need a mechanical washing
unit to wash clothes.
We just used a washing machine.
You don't need an electric
can opener to feed yourself.
All you need is a trusty
Swiss Army knife.
I'm hungry.
No!
Mommy? Why are you making
civilization collapse?
I don't know. I guess Mother's Day
just puts me in a bad mood.
Why's that, Ma?
One Mother's Day 70 years ago...
...the only man I ever loved
walked out on me.
Some snot-eating bastards say
it made me a bitter woman.
- Ma. You're not a bitter...
- Cram it, ape!
I haven't seen that stallion
since the day he left.
But if I ever see him again, I swear
I'll jam a squirrel in him!
Zoidberg.
Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having
a wonderful time!
What happens if the fire goes out?
We'll go to Pottery Barn
and steal their fire!
We could use my new invention!
A pointy rock tied to a stick!
- Outsiders!
- Defend the fire!
We've come for you.
What do you want from me?
We want you to get back with Mom.
It's the only way
to make her happy again.
Wait. You mean, you and Mom?
Played pelvic pinochle?
I'm afraid so.
It's a humiliating story that I hope
never to tell. Well, pull up a chair.
<i>Our paths crossed when I was a</i>
<i>researcher at Mom's Robot Company.</i>
<i>The moment our eyes met we knew we'd</i>
<i>be going at it like woodchucks.</i>
<i>She was my first love. Or at least</i>
<i>the earliest one I can still remember.</i>
<i>But then, 70 years ago today...</i>
Good news!
I've invented a new children's toy!
I call it <i>Q</i>- T McWhiskers! When you pet
it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes.
<i>Meow!</i>
Wonderful, Hubie!
Build them 8 feet tall and replace
the rainbow with a laser!
We'll make billions on
the arms market!
Things 8 feet tall aren't cute!
That's why my Colossal Tammy
Tinkle Doll was a failure!
You don't understand me!
We're finished!
She never got over it, professor.
Hell hath no fury like the vast
robot armies of a woman scorned.
She commands them with a remote
control she keeps in her bra.
But if Glasses Man makes up with her,
she'll be happy and stop the robots.
Make up with her?
After she went psycho when I thought
everything was cool? Impossible!
The TV's getting away!
<i>That's why the third graders at PS- 13</i>9
<i>are Morbo 's "Vermin of the</i> W<i>eek. "</i>
<i>In actual news, the human race was</i>
<i>doomed to extinction...</i>
<i>... as the robot revolt turned violent.</i>
<i>Meow!</i>
Didn't you say Mom keeps
the robot control in her bra?
Bra.
You don't have to get
back together with Mom.
Seduce her, get her bra off, and use
the remote to deactivate the robots.
That's so filthy, it might work.
The man is going to touch Mommy?
The thought of caressing
that leathery hide...
...makes the tapioca rise
in my gullet.
Please. The world's fate depends on
you getting to second base with Mom.
Very well. If cop a feel I must,
then cop a feel I shall!
For this demonstration, I've placed
one of Mother's bras on Ignor.
The robot controller is nestled
in the left cup.
Never fear. My magic fingers still
know how to do their stuff.
To escape the death squads...
...we'll take Mother
to her cabin in the Bronx.
You can get there using this
precious noncomputerized map.
- Leela bring fire?
- No. We're set for fire.
The professor can't walk to the Bronx.
How will we get there
without a hover car?
In my time, we had a way of moving
things without hovering.
- Impossible!
- It was called...
Let me think... It was really famous.
Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
- Never heard of it.
- Show us this, the wheel!
There! Finished!
Wouldn't it work better
if the wheels were round?
It's my invention, we do it my way!
All we need is something to pull it.
Hurry! The robots have taken
Suffolk County!
I'm ready to seduce! I'm wearing my
kissing dentures and my evening truss.
Here. Give her these.
And if that doesn't work, I got you a
six-pack of champagne and a funnel.
Who the sweaty hell is it?
Hubert Farnsworth?
I was out fleeing some robots...
...when moonlight glinting off their
bloody claws made me think of you.
It's been so long. You pus-dripping
sack of double-smoked butt jerky.
- May I come in?
- Never!
Is this what human mating looks like?
Because I like it.
Move your freaking hoof, you goat!
- Here, I brought you these.
- Daffodils.
Seventy years and you remembered
my favorite flower.
Your favorite what?
Why does my foot hurt?
Won't you come in?
Yes!
- You broke my heart, Hubert.
- And you broke mine.
Granted, that was four
or five hearts ago.
What have you been up to?
Inventing. Sending delivery crews to
their doom. Breeding atomic monsters.
Honestly, Hubert.
You and your atomic monsters.
Your eyes always were the most
beautiful shade of milky white.
And your skin still dangles
so gracefully from your neck.
Darling, I should never have
tampered...
...with that cute little
<i>Q</i>- T McWhiskers.
No, it was silly of me to object.
One foot tall, eight feet, fifteen
feet, what does it matter?
You should see the new
16-foot models.
Sixteen feet? Go to hell! I was a fool
to think you'd changed, you old bat!
Filthy toothless nerd bastard!
- Damned she-fossil!
- Stink pig!
<i>Here we go.</i> J<i>ust unhook it and</i>
<i>get the remote. So many hooks.</i>
<i>Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first</i>
<i>one's back on again! I give up.</i>
W<i>ait! Victory!</i>
<i>Oh, my. Now I'll</i> j<i>ust...</i>
<i>The remote... I'll</i> j<i>ust...</i>
Oh, my.
I'm worried. It shouldn't take this
long to get to second base.
Land robots!
<i>I've got a big, big thirst</i>
<i>for human blood!</i>
Where in funky town is the professor?
Nothing here but a couple
of elephant skin rugs.
- Oh, yes.
<i>- They're inside! Get them!</i>
I suppose I should switch off
the robots...
...before they ruin
this romantic evening.
Everyone, help Mom find her bra!
There it is!
<i>- Fan beats man!</i>
- Is anything not a robot?
<i>I'm not a robot.</i>
All right, greeting card! I'll grab
the cash, you wreck the place.
You! Bending Unit!
Mommy needs that bra to end the robot
rebellion. Stretch and get it for me.
Sorry, Ma. You ordered me to rebel.
And loot I shall!
A six-pack of champagne!
Don't mind if I help myself.
<i>No, Comrade Bender!</i>
<i>Li</i>q<i>uor is the opiate...</i>
<i>...of the human bourgeoisie.</i>
- Say what?
<i>In the glorious robot workers '</i>
<i>paradise, there will be no li</i>q<i>uor!</i>
<i>- Only efficient synthetic fuels!</i>
- No liquor?
<i>- Do svidaniya,</i> comrade!
<i>- No!</i>
Hurry, Bender! Get the bra!
Okay, fan. Just hold still
and let me grab...
<i>Death to all humans!</i>
<i>Free soda for all humans!</i>
Mmm. I love you, Mom. Let's grow
ancient together.
Way to go, professor.
The plan worked!
Plan? What plan? I thought this was a
spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex!
It started out as a plot to rummage
through your underwear.
But once I got in there, I found more.
Much more.
Now I want to shout our love
from the rooftops.
Perhaps I'll breed an albino
shouting gorilla!
Out of my house, you lying scum pile!
- I never want to see you again!
- But, dustcakes?
Well, time for this robot
to get back to work.
Too bad it didn't work out with Mom,
professor.
Yes. But I'll always love her
in my own subtle way.
Love Mom! Love Mom!
Love Mom! Mom! Mom!
<i>You created me, Mom...</i>
<i>... so you're to blame, for the love</i>
<i>that I feel from hearing your name.</i>
<i>You're as tender as corned beef</i>
<i>and warm as pastrami...</i>
<i>I love my Mommy.</i>

Good news, everyone!
My new invention lets you operate
equipment from great distances.
I call it the "Fing-Longer. "
Observe.
And here we go.
There!
Pretty long, eh?
Yeah, really long!
But what's that?
That's my What-lf Machine.
Ask a "what-if" question and it
simulates what would happen.
- Does it really work?
- Of course!
It's just not very long.
I got a question!
As a robot among humans, I never feel
accepted at parties or nude beaches.
So I've always
secretly wondered...
What if I was 500 feet tall?
Let's watch, shall we?
My work here is done.
I'm so Ionely since I came
to the future.
Will you be my friend?
Who are you?
I'm a big robot!
And I want a big cereal.
You too? Will you be my friend?
Put her there, pal!
No, your wallet.
Three, two, one, zero!
That calms the shakes.

We can try my experimental

We'll need a guinea pig.
What? Two meals in one week?
Gotcha!
A guinea pig tricked me!
What?
So now Zoidberg is big.
That's more like it!

Who put this in here?
No!
Are you people satisfied?
This gentle visitor is dying!
- We'll never even know why he came.
- I'll tell you...
...with my final breath.
I came here with a simple dream...
...a dream of killing all humans.
And this is how it must end?
Who's the real seven-billion-ton

It just takes me a while.
All right, let's do it.
What if I was a little more impulsive?
Just a little.
Not too much.
Look what I bought on a wild impulse!
New boots!
They're like my old ones,
but with a crazy green stripe!
Never know what I'm gonna do next.
Come here, Leela.
I have something important to say.
I'm old and I need an heir.
Someone to spend my riches...
...and care for my
man-eating anteaters.
The others aren't levelheaded.
They're too impulsive.
Not like you. Not like predictable,
dull-as-dishwater Leela.
Hello? New boots?
So I've made you my sole heir.
The day I die, you'll be a very
wealthy woman.
Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy.
The day I die. Because you're
so un-impulsive.
You've killed me! You've killed me!
What have I done?
I just told you! You've killed me!
Okay, try to be nonchalant.
All right, you're nonchalant.
Don't rub our noses in it.
Sweet anteater of Santa Anita!
The professor's been eaten!
What?
It's mighty suspicious.
I'll call the cops.
After I flush some things.
Police? Nosy meddlers.
I happen to have mail-order degrees
in Murder-ology and Murder-onomy.
Zoidberg is afoot!
Perhaps his files can help.
"Citation for Public Nudity. "
Another one.
A new will, naming...
- You! As his sole heir!
- What does that prove?
It's a video will.
It shows you killing him.
All right, anteater number one.
Who did it?
Was it anteater number two?
Don't stick your tongue out at me!
I need a name!
What? How do you spell that?
What are you hacking off?
My torso?
It is! My precious torso!
Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things!
- Got disposal trouble?
- No!
Shocking about the professor.
And now Hermes is missing.
Well, doesn't affect me.
Hey, what's this?
Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm?
I'm shocked!
Food in the disposal.
Hair and flesh go in the trash!
I couldn't stop.
Wait. Don't you care
that I killed him?
Ain't nothing wrong with murder...
...as long as I can wet my beak.
Blackmail?
I prefer the word extortion.
The "x" makes it sound cool.
Please, I'm made of metal. You...
Wait, not the microwave!
Okay, that's it.
No more killing.
Next time, just have a stick of gum.
Now, to hide the body.
Honk, honk!
Sporty go-cart, Leela!
So hip and sexy!
So unlike you.
Got any gum?
No.
Everyone's here.
- Who are you?
- Scruffy, the janitor.
- I've never seen you before.
- I've never seen you neither.
<i>Q</i>uiet, please.
I've called you all here to watch me
gradually solve the crime.
One of you is a big murderer!
The killer left one fatal clue.
The boot print on this lab coat.
Couldn't be me. I never wear boots.
See?
What smells like boot feet?
This is preposterous!
Obviously, the murderer is...
My next clue came at 4: 15,
when the clock stopped.
Two hours later, at 4: 15...
...I discovered the murdered body
of Amy's dead, deceased corpse.
I know who killed them people.
In Scruffy's opinion, it were...
It's as I suspected.
The crime is unsolvable.
A letter from my friend Bender.
"Dear Doctor Jerk-berg, if
you're reading this, I'm dead.
The murderer was..."
My God! It can't be!
The murderer, it was...
I'm bored. You're boring.
What's on TV?
Could you get the lights
on your way out?
What's that?
Lobster. You want some?
Sure.
- I think I figured out those deaths.
- Really?
Are we near an Indian graveyard?
- No.
- No?
Then it was you!
What's come over me?
I killed one person on impulse.
Then another. And another.
That covers three.
Now, to make sure you won't talk...
...I'm gonna have to do
something really impulsive!
So, what do you think of the
impulsive new me?
I like it.
Good. Now let me just get the lights.
I really like it.
Who else has a question for
the machine? Scruffy? Fry?
I have one.
- What if Bender was giant?
- We already saw that.
I know. I want to see it again.
No, ask something less stupid.
Oh, how about this?
What if I never came to the future?
There, now that question
is somewhat less stupid.
What would happen if Fry never came
to the future?
Hello? Pizza delivery for...
..."I.C. Wiener. "
Oh, crud.
Here's to another lousy millennium.
You're going back in the toilet!
What is it?
A rip in the very fabric
of space-time.
Hey, look! An ugly, scared guy!
Is one of you I.C. Wiener?
If that's his pizza, then I am.
You believe me about the monsters,
right?
There's only three monsters, kid.
Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong.
Now quit picking your nose
and knead that dough!
The usual, Professor Hawking?
<i>No, I'd like something good.</i>
Hawking, you're all right!
Stephen Hawking!
Didn't you invent gravity?
<i>Sure.</i> W<i>hy not?</i>
Has anyone ever seen a hole
in space with monsters in it?
If I'm the first,
I'll call it a "Fry Hole. "
<i>There is no need to worry.</i>
<i>I must go. There is much to do.</i>
Hawking, your pizza!
<i>Toss it in the garbage.</i>
<i>There he is. Seize him.</i>
Who said that?
Who are you?
I'm Al Gore.
These are my V.P. Action Rangers.
Our sole duty is to prevent disruption
in the space-time continuum.
Isn't your sole duty
to break ties in the Senate?
That, and protect
the space-time continuum.
You want to see my Fry Hole?
Oh, yes. But first, meet the team.
You know Stephen Hawking.
Nichelle Nichols,
a.k.a. Commander Uhura.
Incoming transmission from MCI.
It sounds like low rates.
I'm in the tub!
This is Gary Gygax,
inventor of Dungeons & Dragons.
Greetings!
It's a pleasure to meet you!
And our intern, Deep Blue,
the chess-playing computer.
<i>Bishop to knight 4.</i>
Not every mission can be solved
by chess, Deep Blue.
Where am I?
You're in a terrestrial
transport module.
A school bus!
What's going on?
It's about that rip in space-time.
<i>I call it a "Hawking Hole. "</i>
Hey, I saw it first!
W<i>ho will</i> The Journal
of <i>Q</i>uantum Physics <i>believe?</i>
Apparently, something was
supposed to happen but didn't...
...due to quantum flux.
So we had to beat you with rackets.
If that event doesn't occur...
...the universe will be destroyed.
As an environmentalist,
I'm against that.
So then I almost fell
into this thingy.
<i>I call it a "Hawking Chamber. "</i>
But I missed and wanged my head.
Well, obviously that wang
should have killed you.
- What?
- Let's finish the job!
No, wait! There must be a peaceful...
<i>- Hold him down.</i>
<i>- Check.</i>
Something's wrong!
Murder isn't working.
Let's try something else.
We should...
Put the dice away.
I'm getting an idea!
What if he was meant to be frozen?
<i>Yes, shove him in the tube.</i>
<i>It was my idea.</i>
There he is again! He brought nerds!
Take this!
Hurry, get in before
the universe collapses!
I'll need a weapon
to fight drunken robots!
Here, take my plus-one mace!
Okay. Here I go.
You fool! You foolish fool!
What could go wrong?
<i>Great. The universe was destroyed.</i>
Then where are we now?
I can darn well tell you where
we're not. The universe.
Eternity with nerds. It's a <i>Star Trek</i>
convention all over again!
Anyone want to play
Dungeons & Dragons?
- Yeah.
- Sure.
I'm a 10th-level vice president.
That was preposterous.
Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria.
This thing isn't worth
the gold it's made of.
Anyway, the Fing-Longer
seems to be a success.
- Way to go!
- Right on, professor.
So that's how it would be if I'd
invented the Fing-Longer.
A man can dream though.
A man can dream.

Bender
B-E-N-D-E-R, Bender
Saying B-E-N-D!
Mail call!
Amy, your designer lingerie catalog.
Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade.
And Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet.
You buy once,
you're on the list forever.
And for Bender. . . .
A black-bordered envelope.
Someone you know must have died.
I hope it was one of my enemies.
Those guys suck.
Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir!
I'm sorry.
When's the funeral?
Tomorrow, at the family castle.
Followed by the reading of his will.
Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers,
whom I've always hated!
Come on! It'll be fun.
Pardon me, my good simpleton.
Could you take us to yon castle?
Some say unholy things
happen up there.
For example, all of us say that.
Superstitious robot mumbo jumbo.
Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not.
With your science,
are you closer to understanding. . .
. . .the mystery of how a robot
walks or talks?
Yes, you idiot! The circuit diagram
is here on the inside of your case.
I choose to believe what I was
programmed to believe.
I will go this far and no further.
And so we commend
Vladimir's remains to the earth.
Filings to filings. Rust to rust.
To my loyal butler, You There,
for decades of service. . .
. . .I leave a pittance to be paid
in 20 installments. . .
. . .of 1 /20th of a pittance each.
To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who
never learned the value of a dollar. . .
. . .I leave my entire
$1 0 million fortune.
-Is that a lot?
-To my loving nephew, Bender. . .
. . .if he's not responsible
for my death, I leave my castle.
Let's stay there tonight!
On condition that he spend
one night in it.
Oh, man! There's always a catch.
I get a good vibe from this place.
Nice long dinner table. . .
. . .quiet, well-behaved spiders,
graveyard-adjacent.
Yep, it's gonna be--
-What is it?
-That painting's eyes are watching me!
Motor eye sensors attached
to motion detectors.
So does my butt, but I don't frame it
and put it on the wall. Although. . . .
-What's that?
-I don't know, but it's infectious.
No doubt about it.
This place is haunted.
Don't be silly, man.
The last ghost died 200 years ago.
The last human ghost.
But robot ghosts?
"01 01 1 001 01 . " What does it mean?
It's just gibberish.
" 1 01 001 1 01 0?! "
Uncle Vladimir!
Come, Bender. You'll like being dead.
They said that about being alive!
Join us.
Join us.
Join us.
Just as I suspected. These robots were
buried in improperly shielded coffins.
Their programs leaked into the wiring
through this old modem. . .
. . .allowing them to project themselves
as holograms.
Of course! It was so obvious!
That sequence of words I said
made perfect sense.
We really should tell Bender
there's nothing to be afraid of.
Bender, wake up!
He's okay!
Quick, does anyone have any liquor?
Bender, what happened?
Somebody ran me over!
And not with a normal hover car.
It crept along on round rubber feet,
like a wolf!
Poor Bender. Seeing things.
You've been drinking too much.
Or too little.
Anyway, not the right amount.
Maybe he has. Look at these tracks.
I think Bender may be
telling the truth.
Bender, you look awful.
I prescribe makeup.
Here! It just so happens I have
my Mary Kay sample case.
I just need sleep. I had nightmares
about cars running people over.
Many dream of a fresh new look.
And Mary Kay can make
those dreams come true.
Look! They found those same
rubbery tracks in New New York.
A hit-and-run
by the robot porno theater.
Robot porno theater?
I was in that general area last night.
Whoever ran me down out on the moors
followed me back here!
No one's trying to run you over.
Stop being a big hallucinating baby.
Yeah? Could a big hallucinating baby
do this?
I'm scared!
I don't know which I like more,
smashing cars or faces.
Lucky you won't decide tonight.
Come on. It's church tomorrow.
Did you hear something?
It was probably just
a golden marmoset.
Don't sound like no golden marmoset
I ever heard.
Made it.
So, what are you wearing tomorrow?
Where. . .? What the. . .?
Transmission fluid? Where have I been?
What happened?
Gets out of here, youse lousy bum!
-Please, I'm scared.
-We all are. It's the human condition.
That's why I put on this tough guy
facade. Now beat it!
I passed out around midnight,
much earlier than usual.
When I woke up, I found these
in my chest cabinet.
Relax. You were probably just
shooting big fuzzy craps.
No! I think I may have hurt someone.
Lord, I'm on the verge
of a nervous meltdown.
You're scaring me.
You're going wacko!
Right. I need professional help.
And damn the expense!
Damn the expense!
You have nothing to worry about.
Except a nightmarish life
of unremitting horror!
For you see, you are a were-car.
A were-car?
The car that ran you down
was a were-car.
It beamed the virus to you
through its demonic headlights!
That's crazy.
Yes. So crazy that it must be true!
Each midnight,
when your clock resets to 0. . .
. . .your hardware reconfigures
into a murderous car.
I can't keep running people over.
I'm not famous enough
to get away with it. Help me!
Yes. But you must be willing
to pay a terrible price.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Follow me.
Based on this ancient
"read me" file. . .
. . .your only hope is to destroy
the first were-car.
I'm with you.
In its death throes, the car will beam
out the virus' uninstall program. . .
. . .ridding you of the curse.
Otherwise, I can never die?
Sure you can die! You want to die?
No! There's still too many things
I don't own!
Then live on. Forever cursed!
Each night, your attacks will
become more gruesome. . .
. . .until one dark night you are doomed
to kill your dearest friend.
I wouldn't want to be me.
Now go. Go!
Could one of you just--?
Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here.
There. No rampaging for you tonight.
What about welding everyone
except me to the wall?
Just relax. Tomorrow we'll pry
you down, have breakfast. . .
. . .and go hunt down
that ancient evil.
It'll be a rich, full day.
I'm gonna go make my dinners
for the next month and freeze them.
-Bender, no!
-Fry, stay back!
You jerk! I thought I was
your best friend!
What kind of two-timing kill-mobile
are you?
He's supposed to murder his closest
friend, which was me.
But he went for you, not even trying
to second-degree-murder me.
Could you help me?
Bender crushed my foot.
Stop rubbing it in!
Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you.
Did I hurt you?
Not physically. Why not ask
your new best friend Leela?
-I tried to run you over?
-It was very sweet of you.
It doesn't mean anything.
I have love enough for two.
Words. Nothing but sweet words turning
into bitter orange wax in my ears.
Enough with the feelings.
To cure Bender, we've got to hunt down
the original were-car.
-Cursed. Got it.
-Whatever.
-The tracks lead here.
-Thanks, eagle eye.
It's daylight.
He should be in robot form.
But be careful.
Many robots are stupid and violent.
I wish I was stupid and violent. We'd
see what's what. I'd pound him till--
Get ye to your houses,
ye ignorant villagers!
We aren't ignorant villagers.
We're sophisticated New New Yorkers.
Whup his butt!
Stop! What are ye doing?
Whaling on the original were-car,
which is you, jerk!
-Ye think me be he?
-Sl.
Nee. I mean no.
I was given the curse
many a year ago. . .
. . .while on a bird watching trip
to The Arctic.
I was attacked
by a vicious motorized sled.
The natives called it
the abominable snowmobile.
It's true. I ran over that
bird-watching jerk and 1 00 others.
Even my best friend
from aromatherapy school.
I once had a best friend who liked
to smell things with me.
Alas, I'm not the original were-car.
I got the curse while taking a class
from a famous robot actor.
You know him as...
... Calculon.
O fate most cruel,
would that my acting skills. . .
. . .might avail me a sword
to slay this wretched curse.
-Let's kick him!
-Let me explain.
It all began one fateful night
1 000 years ago.
Whoa, whoa! You're 1 000 years old?
Your bio says you're 27.
Lies! I change my identity
and appearance. . .
. . .every decade to avoid suspicion.
I was all of history's
great acting robots.
Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat,
David Duchovny.
Are you the first were-car or not?
No. But you're near
the end of your search.
I was attacked
by the original were-car.
Give us a name, MacButt!
The year was 201 9, and I was just
a lowly roboton working. . .
...in an automotive research lab.
I was working on Project Satan...
...a savage car built from the evil
parts of the world's most evil cars.
The steering wheel from Hitler's car,
the signal from Charles Manson 's VW.
-Knight Rider's windshield wipers.
-Knight Rider wasn't evil.
His windshield wipers were.
It didn't come up in the show.
Only after finishing Project Satan...
...did they discover they had made
a horrible mistake.
For you see, it was pure evil.
What happened to Project Satan?
It's either in Paris
or much more likely...
...still in the abandoned
automotive lab.
Distract the were-car. . .
. . .and I'll kill it by plugging its
exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
There it is.
It looks so unhappy.
Excuse me, are you Project Satan?
Don't be afraid.
We know what you are.
You do?
Would you like us to put you
out of your misery?
Misery? What misery?
I love killing people!
Squishing them till their organs
squirt out like chunky mustard!
Look, everyone loves killing people,
but I don't wanna hurt my friends.
Oh, no! It's midnight!
Hey, this is starting
to feel pretty good.
Fry, distract him!
Hey, Project Satan! Over here!
I'm a blind pedestrian. 20 points!
Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!
That's right, thanks to
Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor. . .
. . .the most evil propulsion system
ever conceived!
Take whichever one you want.
Oh, boy! I feel like a car
in a candy store!
Yes! He chose me!
He's trying to kill me!
Leela, I'm so happy!
Oh, thanks, Bender.
Too tight! Too tight!
Bender, you're cured!
But what happened to Fry?
I must have killed him!
He's my best friend and I killed him!
I never felt so empty inside.
Bender, I'm alive!
You didn't hurt me at all!
But I know you wanted to.
And that's what matters.
Here's to you.
That's my last beer, you bastard!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you too, buddy.
I'll kill you too.

War ls the H Word
Spider, Hubble, Nit. . . .
Big Pink! The gum with the
breath-freshening power of ham.
And it pinkens your teeth
while you chew.
All right, sergeant, $1 00 of
Pixie Stix and porno mags. . .
. . .with your 5 percent
military discount, comes to $95.
Forty cents.
You forgot our
5 percent discount.
Only for military people.
What? This is the worst kind
of discrimination!
-The kind against me!
-Look, our policy is. . .
. . .if for any reason you're
not satisfied, I hate you.
Okay, now I'm mad.
Full price for gum?
That dog won't hunt, Monsignor.
Hello. We're here because
we love our planet.
Sign here, patriots.
You'll get your discount cards.
Can we use the cards to buy gum,
then quit the Army?
Playing you all for chumps?
Correct. There's no obligation.
Unless, of course, war were declared.
-What's that?
-War were declared.
Be careful, Fry. If you kill anyone,
make sure to eat their heart. . .
. . .to gain their courage.
Their rich, tasty courage.
I don't want you to worry
about your jobs.
That's why I'm firing you now.
I want to enlist.
They always die if I'm not there.
Sorry.
The Army's policy is men only.
-What?
-Shameful, I agree.
In the old days, I proudly fought with
female troops, shoulder to shoulder.
After some deadly blunders caused
by distracting low-cut fatigues. . .
. . .and harmless pinching,
the Army decided women weren't fit.
-Not when I'm in charge.
-Someone should teach you a lesson.
If it's a lesson in love, I suffer
from a very sexy learning disability.
-What do I call it, Kif?
-Sex-lexia.
Men, you're lucky. Soon you'll
be fighting for your planet.
Many of you will die for it.
A few will be forced through
a fine mesh screen.
They'll be the luckiest.
-Great. We're gonna die.
-And this ham gum is all bones.
Now, to present the logistics
of our mission. . .
. . .welcome the original Gerber Baby. . .
. . .Earth President Richard M. Nixon.
This is the brass ring, fellas.
-Planet Spheron One.
-Cool effect!
A desolate, ugly planet. . .
. . .with no natural resources
or strategic value. Questions?
-Why is this planet worth dying for?
-Can't say, you're the one who'll die.
So we'll know,
who's the enemy?
We know nothing
about their language. . .
. . .history, or appearance.
But we can assume this:
They stand for everything
we don't stand for.
Also, they said
you look like dorks!
They look like dorks!
I'm gonna--
What's the matter, private?
Tent got your tongue?
Kif, write that down and send it
to Humor in Uniform.
That guy makes Speedy Gonzales
look like Regular Gonzales.
That recruit is phenomenal!
Yes. He edged out my old mark
by two seconds.
And 1 6 minutes.
And 1 2 hours.
I do plan to finish someday, Kif.
Good hustle, soldier.
Sorry, sir. I was still in attack
mode. You know how testosterone is.
As a bubbling Crock-Pot
of male hormones, I sure do.
-What's your name, private?
-Lee, La, Man. La Man. Lemon!
Lee Lemon, sir.
Lemon, you're a man's man.
A man's man's man.
More importantly, your hand,
while firm and manly. . .
. . .is soft as a velvet child.
What's your lotion?
Pert and Popular.
Roger that.
Get me 1 0 cases of Pert and Popular.
What about your Jergens?
Squirt it on some homeless man
with dry elbows.
Private Lee Lemon may well be
the finest recruit I've ever seen.
That young man fills me with hope.
And some other emotions that are weird
and deeply confusing me.
Hello.
Now that's a nice rosé.
Anyway, we open up the panda crate
and the thing's dead.
Upchucked its bamboo.
True story.
That's whatever you were talking
about for you.
-Mind if we sit with you?
-Why the hell would l?
We're all guys here.
Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.
-Good point. I guess.
-You're my kind of soldier.
A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested,
beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle.
-Who's got a special lady back home?
-I have a thing for this girl at work.
Really? What type is she?
Blond, or Chinese, or Cyclops?
-Cyclops.
-She sounds sweet.
But sweet girls aren't for you.
You hard-fighting, hard-farting,
ugly son of a--
Stop flattering me!
Ten hut!
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Lee Lemon. . .
. . .the flaming star
of Brannigan's Rough Rangers.
Lemon, do you like to read?
I got a great book on tape.
It's about life in ancient Greece.
Sir, the alarm! I think I'd better--
Don't talk. Just go.
We're now in position
above Spheron One.
This is the moment we trained
for all yesterday afternoon.
Now, the battle plan. The key
to victory is the element of surprise.
Surprise!
It's creepy.
This is the worst part.
The calm before the battle.
-And then the battle's not so bad?
-Right, I forgot about the battle.
-What's happening?
-Holy shoot! Look!
The enemy! They're balls!
-Charge your gun, Fry!
-Right.
Watch where you're shooting, private!
You spooked Felicity.
-Give this to my son.
-You got it!
Wait. I didn't tell you
where he lives.
Your son might also like those boots.
Cover us, buddy! You got the only
wounded-up positron shooter!
Fry, you emu-bellied coward!
Bender, no!
If they put me on a stamp,
tell them to use the young Bender.
Incoming wounded! All personnel,
report to operating tent four!
I mean, five! Repeat, four.
Ready to operate?
I'd love to.
But first, I have to perform surgery.
I kid. I kid.
Scalpel.
Blood bucket.
-Priest. Next patient!
-Leave some for the enemy to kill.
Leave him alone!
He has twice your training.
Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher.
This is how it starts.
First jokes, then the heavy stuff.
When will the killing end?
Look at this sissy. While others
fought and died pointlessly. . .
. . .he was hiding,
wallowing in his own cowardice.
-That wasn't cowardice.
-I'm depromoting you.
Kif, what's the most humiliating job?
-Being your assistant.
-Wrong! Being your assistant.
Private, henceforth,
you'll be Kif's assistant.
-That's not bad.
-You speak when I say so, worm!
-I'm afraid he's gone.
-Doc, I ain't dead!
-Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor.
-Believing it won't make it true.
It isn't a war. It's a murder.
It isn't war, it's murder!
Bender, old buddy, hang in there!
Here lies the bravest soldier
I've ever seen since me.
I order that he be melted down
and made into a statue of himself.
Slow down, I'm up to something here.
I want this robot fixed. Fixed like
Kennedy fixed the 1 960 election.
-Damn bean-eating war hero!
-Ready to operate, doc?
I'd love to.
But first, I have to perform surgery.
That's my joke! I'll kill you!
Prewar scotch.
-Welcome, lieutenant. Looking sharp.
-I got wheels! With clickity-clackers!
Where's the little umbrella?
It's what makes a scotch on the rocks!
Actually, sir--
Make me a new one.
Use a brush, you dunderhead!
And mix these mixed nuts!
I see two almonds touching!
Listen, this war is in danger
of going all quagmire on me.
So I am sending you
on one last mission.
Hot diggity daffodil!
A mission of peace.
You'll negotiate with their leaders,
the Brain Balls.
They've got lots of brains
and lots of chutzpa.
Joining you is our top peace
negotiator, Henry Kissinger.
-How are you?
-Is he any good?
Looking like that, he talked his way
into Jill St. John's bed.
A little lower. Lower.
Lower. A lot lower.
Too low!
Lower.
Private Lemon! No need to leave.
My stall just became free.
Maybe you should put on a towel.
Right.
I'm trying the new lotion
you recommended.
If I accidentally put too much
on my hands, I could rub it on you. . . .
Brannigan!
My God, cover yourself.
I didn't live 1 000 years to look
at another man's gizmo.
Sorry, Mr. President.
I didn't realize.
Kif, raise him up nipple high.
Stuff yourself into a uniform. We have
to leave before the bomb goes off.
Bomb! What bomb?
The doctors put it
in that gullible robot.
Zapp! Zapp!
lnspect the troops later.
It's time to activate the bomb.
Now ask for economic cooperation.
Excuse me.
Attention! Everyone, evacuate
the planet immediately!
Not because
it's meatloaf night.
Come, Lemon,
before this dump blows up.
Could you say when the bomb
is exploding?
Sure, my significant soldier.
It's voice-activated.
It'll detonate when the robot
speaks a certain word.
What's the word? Sir.
It's the one word the robot uses most.
We got it from this database
of his 1 0 most frequently used words.
Number 1 0: "CHUMP"
Number 9: "CHUMPETTE"
Number 8: "YOURS"
Number 7: "UP"
Number 6: "PIMPMOBILE"
Number 5: "BITE"
Number 4: "MY"
Number 3: "SHINY"
Number 2: "DAFFODIL"
And Bender's most frequently
uttered word. . .
. . .the word which
can destroy this planet:
-"ASS"
-We don't have long!
We demand bouncing,
followed by rolling of the third type.
What?
My chair's too hard.
It's a pain in the--
What do you call it?
Lower back! That whole region.
I got to break that gate,
beat up the guards. . .
. . .steal that chopper
and rescue Bender.
-I did it! Wait, that's not me.
-Come on! We got to save Bender!
-You want to save him? Why?
-Fry, don't you recognize me?
-Hermes?
-Lee, when will I see you again?
You two are good friends?
But I thought we would
be good friends.
Let's see how friendly you get
when you're sharing a prison cell.
Hey, Zapp?
-Leela!
-So it's you I've been attracted to!
I've never been so happy
to be beaten up by a woman.
Let's do it again sometime.
The elders tell
of a young ball like you.
He bounced 3 meters in the air.
Then 1 .8 meters in the air.
Then he bounced 4 meters in the air.
Do I make myself clear?
Mr. Ambassador,
our people tell the same story.
These balls are making me testy!
If they don't stop bouncing,
I'll shove this treaty up their--
-Where do you shove things up a ball?
-Not a productive area of discussion.
We're here.
I followed the bouncing balls.
I'll keep a safe altitude.
You parachute down.
My friend's life is at stake.
I can finally prove I'm not a coward.
-Will you push me?
-I already did!
Thank you!
At last, war has made me into a man.
Gentlemen, we must put an end
to the bloodshed.
We've seen too many body bags
and ball sacks.
We can't allow bouncing
of the seventh variety.
No more crap! I'm catching
the next pimpmobile out!
But before I go,
I have one thing to say.
-Bite my shiny metal--
-Stop! You can't say the next word!
Up yours, chump!
I said it 906 times before lunch.
If you say the A-word, you'll blow
this planet straight to the H-word.
Young man, you have the bravery
of a hero.
And breath as fresh as a summer ham.
-What's funny?
-Bender's got the upper hand now.
The game's name is: Make Bender
Happy, or He Blows Up the Planet!
I'd rather die and kill everybody than
sit here listening to these idiots!
Stay calm.
No need to bounce off the handle.
-That's it, I'll say it! A is for--
-Wait!
Stop! We give in to all demands. The
war is over. Our home planet is yours.
All right!
-Wait! We're invading your planet?
-Correct.
I guess you learned a valuable lesson.
Don't mess with Earth!
-May you bounce in peace.
-Get the hell off my planet!
Well, that's it.
Let's reactivate him.
Wake up!
Chumps and chumpettes!
ls the bomb out?
-Can I say the word I love to say?
-Sorry, we couldn't remove it.
It's stuck in there with glue
or something.
Great. What's the point
of living if I can't say "ass"?
I didn't blow up!
Ass, ass, ass, ass!
I'm back in the saddle!
We couldn't disarm it.
We changed the word.
A word you almost never say.
-That's using your ass. And the word?
-Better if you don't know.
Come on, I'm not going to say it.
Please?
-Is it "please"?
-No.
-Words I never say. I know, "thanks" !
-Stop trying to destroy the world.
Wait. Is it "sorry"?
No. "Funderful"?
-"Nonalcoholic"?
-Quit!
Enough already.
"Compassion. " "Shrimp toast. "
"Antiquing"?
I'm all right.

The Cryonic Woman
Giant space robot, this is Captain Fry
of the USS Planet Express ship.
We come in peace.
Tough luck!
We destroyed the toy spaceship.
Now what?
-The keys to the real spaceship!
-Think we should?
Yes, I do.
Have you seen the keys
to the spaceship?
I left them onboard.
I mean, what?!
Relax. The ship won't go anywhere.
I anchored it with the unbreakable
diamond tether.
Hey, Fry! I'm steering with my ass!
The best thing I ever saw!
-That was great!
-And no one suspects a thing!
And that's how we learned our lesson.
You've gone too far this time.
All three of you!
-What did I do?
-You left the keys!
Look at them. Wasn't it obvious
what would happen?
-Yeah, Leela.
-We're very disappointed in you.
I should fire you three right now. . .
. . .but I'm just not that cold-hearted.
You're all fired!
Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you.
Good riddance!
Now Zoidberg is the popular one!
Yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.
So, Zoidberg, what's new?
Oh, you know. . . .
What about money? All I've got
is my first mustache. . .
. . .and a picture of my
old girlfriend, Michelle. . .
. . .and that ski instructor
who's just her friend.
Pardon me, brother.
Care to donate
to the anti-mugging-you fund?
We don't need to beg.
We're not veterans.
What do you suggest?
A robbery of Fort Knox on elephant
back? Dumbest thing I ever heard.
-No. We can get jobs.
-But we just had jobs!
I still have our old career chips.
-Our what?
-Career chips.
Remember? They assign you the job
you're best at.
I tried to give you one
and you ran away?
-It's how we met?
-Then what happened?
Just give me your hand.
Baby.
I'd like my old job counseling
defrostees and assigning them careers.
I was hoping you'd come back.
I even saved your poster of a chimp
expressing your distaste for Mondays.
He lives for the weekend.
Put your hand under the scanner
so I can verify your career chip.
Calcutta, we have a problem.
Delivery boy?
I must have mixed up the chips.
Here's our cryogenic counselor!
Do you like Mondays?
-They're okay.
-Then we'll redecorate your office.
How do you feel about it helping
to be crazy to work here?
Let's see what it says about me!
Welcome aboard, sir!
Remember, when the tube opens, say:
"Welcome to the world of tomorrow! "
I was frozen. I think I know
what defrostees want to hear.
Bathroom's that way.
Tell me what brings you to the future.
I wanted to meet Shakespeare
and I figured time was cyclical.
Nope. Straight line.
-The probulator's done.
-That wasn't so bad.
Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.
Okay, it's about to start.
Welcome to the future, human slave!
Relax, chum.
I'm not really a giant fly.
I'm a horrible robot!
Kill all humans!
He's having a heart attack!
-They'll find a cure in the future.
-We have a cure now!
Good. Then you won't mind
if I use this.
Nothing like a power nap.
Oh, flies, flies and gorillas!
Stay beautiful, doll-face!
That probulator sure knows how to
please a man! So, what's for lunch?
I ordered a pizza.
Pizza delivery for. . .
. . .I.C. Wiener.
Very funny. Now cough up the $1 2.95.
-After half an hour, it's free.
-It's only been 23 minutes.
Well, I've got 33 minutes.
It's only been 23 minutes,
you dumb cannoli!
You got a problem,
let's take it outside!
Okay. I'll fight the box.
I can take him.
Just pay me. I owe 30 bucks
on this uniform.
Thirty five, you stupid meatball!
Who should we unfreeze next?
No. No!
Oh, my God, it's Pauly Shore!
All right!
I loved you in Bio-Dome.
You sure made trouble in that bubble.
If it rhymes,
I can cause trouble in it.
Now that you're in the future,
you can live in an actual bio-dome.
An unattractive prospect.
While researching for the role, I ran
computer simulations demonstrating. . .
. . .that the whole concept
is fundamentally flawed.
Be it expressed via dome,
sphere, cube. . .
. . .or even the stately tetrahedron,
buddy.
So how did you wind up
getting frozen?
During Encino Man, my intellectual
curiosity re: cryogenics was peaked.
I resolved to freeze the weasel.
The weasel!
I was supposed to be unfrozen. . .
. . .for the 1 000th anniversary
screening of Jury Duty ll.
How come I'm not there?
I woke you up early to hang out
and do stuff.
Like what?
-I love this job.
-Me too!
Showtime.
I'll pretend to be dying
of space plague.
Michelle?
Oh, my God!
Fry? ls it really you?
I don't know. Is it really you?
What do you mean?
Are you you, or not?
-Who wants to know?
-Oh, Fry, it is you!
Last time I saw you,
you were doing great.
You dumped me, and your life
was back on track.
-Why'd you freeze yourself?
-Oh, Fry.
After you left, things got worse.
I got married.
I'm sorry.
His name was Charles.
His law school was so prestigious,
the basketball coach...
... was Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
I put him through school
by working with antisocial dogs.
But soon after Charles graduated,
our marriage ran into difficulties.
Sorry.
I turned to the one thing
able to lessen my pain:
A carnival.
But a corn dog bone got lodged
in the control of the Spizzler...
...and I had to ride it
for 8 hours.
But it did give me a chance to think.
I remembered the last time I was
truly happy. When I was with you.
So you froze yourself
to come look for me?
No. I did it for a fresh start.
I didn't know what happened to you.
The police searched but your parents
felt it was a waste of money.
Same reason they kept me out
of school. No one cared I was gone?
Not really. Except for one person.
Who was it?
Everything is so different!
Not everything.
There's still a roach problem.
Now people like art
that's tattooed on fat guys.
I'm on loan from the Louvre.
Please, professor.
We deserve another chance.
And if you won't give me another
chance, perhaps you'd give one to. . .
. . .Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!
Sorry, Og. But I've got a new crew.
How was your delivery
to Fantasy Planet. . .
. . .where everyone's fantasies
come to life?
-Great!
-Organized!
For one beautiful night, I knew
what it was to be a grandmother.
Subjugated, yet honored.
You see, Og?
Everything's running smoothly.
With Fry fired, I can leave my jigsaw
puzzles out. He won't eat the pieces.
Forget about Fry. Hire us back.
He'll never know.
Hey, guys!
Hey, Fry!
So, as Leela was saying,
Fry can go shove a big, old--
I'm glad you're all here.
Here's my ex-girlfriend of the past
1 000 years, Michelle.
Michelle, this is Leela.
This is Bender.
The professor.
-Hermes and Amy.
-Nice to meet you.
And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
Dating your ex, Fry?
-Have you lost all self-respect?
-All what?
-It can end badly. Kids, a house. . . .
-Home invasion by an old roommate.
It's different now.
She was demanding and possessive.
Now she wants me to do stuff,
be with her.
There you go, dearies.
It's a relief to meet you, Amy.
It's hard adjusting to all the strange
stuff of the future.
I'm from Mars.
I feel so out of place. I don't
understand why Fry fits in so well.
Because he didn't in your time.
True. But I used to fit in
really well.
Then good luck, sister.
Don 't take this the wrong way.
-Your friends are freaks.
-Great, huh?
I don't belong.
I don't know anyone.
I can't find vanishing cream that
won't make me really vanish.
-I don't have a job.
-I'm supposed to assign you one.
I'll get your career chip installed.
Hold out your palm.
It's like getting
your hand pierced.
This world is horrible.
Let's go where all we have
is each other.
Romantic.
I'll tell Bender to meet us there.
It's not a "there. " It's a then.
The future.
I thought you meant a motel where
the bed is shaped like stuff.
I love you. Don't you love me?
Sure. To the extent a man can love
a woman. But this is a big step.
Why must you analyze everything
with your relentless logic?
Nothing matters but our love.
You're right. Let's do this now
and never regret it.
Michelle, I don't regret this.
But I rue and lament it.
The year 4000 is disappointing.
I miss 3000 when brains flew
through space and people ate lasers.
It's not so bad. Fate brought
us together and brought us here.
You brought us here.
Whine some more.
It's really attractive.
Now, build us a shelter.
Fine. Everything else sucks. At least
we'll have a nice place to live.
-There!
-You expect me to live in a hole?
It'd be deeper,
but I'm standing on a gopher.
-Oh, look. Some little kids!
-They'll save us!
We're saved!
I'm Butch, leader of this place!
I took your hole.
You can't do nothing about it!
Sir, we have nowhere to go.
Could we please join your society?
All right. But no interfering
with our grand works.
Butch runs a good civilization.
I'll enjoy serving under him.
You know your problem?
You're not ambitious.
You should be chief.
What do I need, ulcers?
I want power. I'm tired
of the chief's girlfriend. . .
. . .Iording it over me
with her fancy coyote hide.
All right. If it'll make you happy,
I'll overthrow society.
On what grounds do you challenge
my authority?
I'm older. I can beat you up.
-I'll bet he could.
-He's got arm hair.
All right, Grandpa. There's only
one way to settle this.
Death rolling.
-What?
-It's like skateboarding.
-Except half the time, someone dies.
-So it's safer than skateboarding.
Last one holding the bandanna
is the new leader.
My mother always said
you were a loser.
-Now go prove her wrong!
-Beth said that?
It's cool. Back off!
My knee! I scraped it!
Poor little guy.
Let me just take a look at--
I won! I'm the new chief!
I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
Hand it over, you giant idiot!
-Butch, your mom's here!
-Ah, man!
Come on, kids!
You're late for Hebrew school!
I don't wanna go.
Every Monday and Wednesday's
the same thing.
This post-apocalyptic wasteland
is very confusing.
-Seriously, I'm weirded out.
-That's because you're a loser.
You were a loser in the year 2000,
you're a loser in the year 4000.
But in 3000, I had it all.
Friends, a low-paying job,
a bed in a robot's closet!
I envied no man!
But you wrecked everything!
Quit standing up for yourself, Fry!
Back at the hole, we'll have a boring
talk about our relationship!
Oh, yeah? Listen to this!
I'm leaving you.
There must be people somewhere.
Yes! Footprints!
And handprints?
But what's happening?
Fry, thank God we found you!
What are you guys doing
in the year 4000?
It's not 4000.
You were only frozen for two days.
I broke your bed.
You were in Pauly Shore's tube. They
delivered it to his movie screening.
They noticed you weren't him
and threw you out.
So these aren't the decaying ruins
of New York in 4000?
-You wish. You're in Los Angeles!
-But there were kids with guns.
Exactly. You're in L.A.
-Everyone shoots at each other.
-That's L.A. !
-There's no sign of civilization.
-Stop with the social commentary.
The people are phony. No one reads.
Everything has cilantro on it--
-Michelle, baby!
-It's not working out, Fry.
Tis better to have loved and lost,
n 'est-ce pas?
I've had it with women.
I'm gonna concentrate on my career.
Can I have my job back?
I've forgotten why I even fired you.
He destroyed your business
and all your possessions.
Oh, that's right. Get lost!
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Parasites Lost
<i>Breaker, breaker, this is the Duck.
You wanna back off them hogs?</i>
<i>- Ten-four. About five miles or so.
- Ten, roger.</i>
I'd better check the fluid levels.
We're okay on Coke syrup.
Oh, man, come on!
Coming through!
- What's that black cracker?
- A tomato.
You're eating a sandwich
from a men's room?
What's the worst thing
that could happen?
It's like a party in my mouth,
and everyone's throwing up.
Look. One of them things
like on our mud flaps.
- Yosemite Sam?
- I'm gonna put my moves on her.
Jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless
they wanna go to the next level.
Fry, I'd rather not dignify them
with an ass-whipping.
Yo, sexy mama, let's get busy
and freaky, in that order.
How would you like it if Leela said
she wanted to make love with you?
I got five minutes. She looks
pretty good for a truck-stop chick.
You take that back! She does not
look good for a truck-stop chick!
You're right, she don't got
enough meat for me.
She does too!
She's got more meat than a cow.
Meat than a cow!
I can't please Leela no matter
what I do. I just want her to like me.
Well, there's always hope.
We gotta go fix
the plasma fusion boiler.
- Who are you?
- Scruffy. A janitor.
- Why aren't you fixing the boiler?
- Schedule conflict.
There, fixed forever.
Scruffy's gonna die
the way he lived.
Oh, marmalade.
Oh, the hypochondriac's back.
What is it this time?
- My lead pipe hurts a little.
- That's normal. Next.
He's a witch!
- Did you eat anything unusual recently?
- No.
- What about that bathroom egg salad?
- I've had better.
Egg salad? Zoidberg will have to
examine your gastrointestinal tract.
Come, everyone.
Give Fry some privacy.
If you can't see well enough, there'll
be a close-up on this video screen.
We'll need to have a look
inside you with this camera.
Guess again.
- Gross!
- Go, man, go.
Watch for any subtle irregularity
in Fry's bowel.
It's gorgeous.
That place used to be a dump.
- Worms? Puke-a-tronic!
- So the eggs in that sandwich were...
Correct! Worm eggs. And the
mayonnaise wasn't too fresh either.
It's nauseating, man. Is there no way
to get rid of the disgusting maggots?
Only one. We'll have to travel
deep inside Fry...
...in this!
- Shotgun!
- Shotgun!
In each gastro-survival kit is a rain
slicker, a disposable fun camera...
...and something to protect you
against bacteria: a harpoon.
Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use
micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?
No. That would require extremely tiny
atoms. Have you priced those lately?
- I'm not made of money. Leave me alone!
- Me next!
Your net suits will let you experience
Fry's worm-infested bowels...
...as if you were actually
wriggling through them.
There's no part of that sentence
I didn't like.
- Is everyone present?
- Definitely.
Here's the plan. We enter the ear,
drip down the back of the throat...
...and make for the bowel. There,
we'll irritate the splenic ganglion...
...and cause a spasm, expelling,
among other things, the parasites.
- I'll tell Fry to wash out his ear.
- No! Fry can't know about the mission.
If he finds out, the worms
will defend themselves.
- They know everything he knows.
- Like how to make ice-cream soup?
- Leela! Your role is to distract Fry.
- Can do!
Leela, you should really try
a facial scrub for your pores.
- Look, a starling!
- Really?
Be very quiet. We're in the ear.
- Okay, professor.
- What?
What about what?
What if we go for a walk, possibly,
because it's such a lovely day?
I'd love to.
- Let's go where he won't put his finger.
- It's hopeless!
Wait! We just have to get past
the eardrum.
- What are they doing to Fry's brain?
- They're giving it a tune-up.
A quick glance suggests
they've doubled his thinking power.
My God! Soon he'll be smarter
than Cher!
Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious
how aromatic hydrocarbons...
...can evoke deep emotions.
For you.
That's a beautiful thought.
And you expressed it
without spewing crumbs at me.
Brace yourselves. We're entering
the interior of Fry's nose.
We're at finger alert five!
Let's just pray nothing stimulates
his smell receptors.
Nobody make a smell.
Quick! We can escape through
that capillary into the sinus.
Usually you don't know
a thing about human anatomy.
I learned it from a decongestant
commercial: "Soothing action..."
- Where are we, the ass?
- The heart.
- Better known as the love muscle.
- Which digests food.
We should be safe so long
as nothing makes it beat faster.
- Abandon ship!
- No!
Set course for
that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
It's good cholesterol,
but it spreads like bad cholesterol.
They're Jazzercising Fry's muscles.
He'll be as strong and flexible as
Gumby and Hercules combined.
Gum-ercules?! I love that guy.
It's that jerk from the truck stop.
Let's go blend in with those pimps.
I don't think so.
Sir, you owe this lady an apology.
Fry, no! He's bulging with
what could be muscles.
I got your apologies right here.
Sorry, ma'am. I've learned a lesson
about not ogling cans I won't forget.
Ah, the stomach.
Scenic gateway to the bowel.
Abandon ship!
No. Don't give up now. We're
close to the pyloric sphincter.
We made it!
There it is,
the stately capitol of Fry's bowel.
A heavily-guarded fortress
surrounding the splenic ganglion.
I've heard of that.
If we can stimulate it, the bowel
will convulse, expelling the worms.
But what about the worms
in other areas?
This is gonna be one hell
of a bowel movement.
- He'll be lucky to have bones left.
- All right, let's mush some worms!
Worms to battle stations!
I had a great time. The flowers,
the puddle, the way you hurt that guy.
But can I axe you something?
Why did you do all that stuff?
There's something I've wanted
to tell you.
But when I try, my mouth feels
like it's stuffed with peanut butter.
- Is it about Bender?
- No, it's about you and me.
- And Bender?
- Bender's not involved. Leela...
...I love you.
- You do?
But only recently have I been able
to articulate my thoughts.
I love you, Leela.
And I always have.
Fry, that's the sweetest,
most wonderful... Wait!
Recently? Like since you ate
that sandwich?
Yeah. I don't know why, but my life
really turned around that day.
Stay here.
Freshen your naugateena?
Please, I need something
to settle my stomach.
The nerve is through here.
Where's Zoidberg?
You'll never guess
where I've been.
One! Two! Three!
There it is.
The pelvic splenic ganglion.
Tickle it, then get ready for the ride
of your lives.
- Don't even think about it.
- Leela! You're in time to help.
If we don't get rid of the worms now,
they'll burrow so deep...
...not even Hermes' famous
jerk prunes could dislodge them.
- I call it Caribbean Drano.
- Fry will be stuck with worms forever.
Perfect.
- I'm okay.
- Leela, you ignorant dope!
- Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
- So?
- Maybe Fry is better off with worms.
- Oh, that's stupid.
If anyone wants to tell me what's
going on, I'll be in the lounge.
Of all the parasites I've had,
these worms are among...
They are the best!
How can I repay you for saving them?
I'll think of something.
Hello, what's all this, then?
Apartment 1 -I.
The old me would joke about that.
It's a little under-furnished. I'm
thinking of having a window installed.
The view's perfect already.
That's the corniest thing I've ever
heard. Let me show you the bedroom.
In a minute.
A holophonor?
Only a few people can play that,
and they're not very good.
They don't have you
to inspire them.
I don't have words to say
how wonderful you are.
I haven't felt this happy
since double-soup Tuesday.
With you, every day
is like double-soup Tuesday.
Oh, Fry, I love what you've become.
What I've become...
- What is it?
- There's something I have to find out.
- Who controls this bowel?
- Who wants to know?
- I am the lord mayor of Cologne!
- You mean colon?
- State your business.
- Have you ever been in love?
I thought I was once.
But then I remembered we reproduce
with spore clouds.
A wonderful girl loves me, but I need
to know if it's me she loves...
...or just what you worms
have made of me. So...
...I'm asking you to leave.
- Listen, you! I was born here.
I raised a cloud of children here. My
ancestors came here on the sandwich.
No one can make me leave!
- Get out or the brain gets it!
- He's bluffing!
He wouldn't willingly make
himself an idiot.
Obviously you've never been in love.
Now, the hand-eye coordination lobe.
You've damaged your brain...
...but no more than a few drinks
or five minutes on a cell phone.
I was working my way toward the
control center of the heart and lungs.
- lf I kill myself, you die with me.
- Wait a minute, man.
I hope Satan has a nice colon,
because that's where you're going.
Stop! We'll leave. But one day
you'll be eating a fast-food burger...
...and boom!
You'll be crawling with us again.
<i>Ever wonder what makes
"special sauce" so special? Yo.</i>
Fry? I missed you. Did you find out
what you needed to find out?
- I'm about to. Let me play for you.
- You don't have to.
- I'm still seduced from before.
- Please. It's important to me.
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
I got nervous and started thinking
about neck bolts.
Wow, did you see that vase break?
It was all like:
- What's happened to you?
- I got rid of the worms.
- Why would you do that?
- I needed to know who you loved...
...me or them.
- Well, which of you wrote that sonnet?
I did! I think. It was probably 50-50.
But that's how I really felt, I swear.
- I don't know.
- Let me try to be romantic on my own.
I've got massage oil. I'll give you a
back rub just like I used to give Amy.
She always seemed to...
Uh-oh.
Sorry you struck out. If it's any
consolation, my life is great.
Babes, bucks, I got it all.
Well, at least I learned
Leela's a lost cause. I give up.
There you go! Good night.
I gotta get up early to go
parasailing with movie stars.
Amazon Women in the Mood
People, we got a problem.
Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs.
So has Fry. What's the big deal?
He's got me beat.
We all love Nibbler, so it's only fair
that we all clean up together.
Still, I propose we make Zoidberg
do it. All in favor?
All opposed?
All abstaining?
Dr. Zoidberg, are you okay?
He's dead.
He always seemed so full of life.
Laughing, singing, begging for scraps.
And now this!
Why with all the crying?
So, that's where I left my shell.
I didn't know it came off.
It was getting a little cramped,
so I molted, why not?
- The fresh air feels good.
- Stop doing that!
So long. I'm off to toss
this old shell in the dumpster...
...and maybe pick up the potato chips
Amy didn't finish.
- Those were toenail clippings.
- A feast is a feast.
Hey, that's my cell phone!
Hello?
Hello? Who is this?
Hello?
Did you swallow your phone again?
Some guy's been calling and hanging
up 1 0 times a day for a year.
Men who call too much
are the worst, I bet.
I wish a decent guy would call me.
Not this spleeze-ball who has me
too terrified to answer the phone.
Hello?
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>
I love you!
Why must I be such a coward?
I'm off to the men's room,
and I need an attendant...
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're crying like a woman.
I see myself as a father figure
to some of my more pathetic men.
Kif, old friend, let's rap.
Well, I'm in love with this girl.
Oh, that's rich! Go on.
I met her a year ago...
...escaping from that cruise ship
you piloted into a black hole.
<i>Yes, it was in all the papers.</i>
Call me.
- I've finished talking.
- Belay that remark!
Your Amy knows my Leela?
I have formed an idea.
I want to negotiate a double date.
You and me, Kif and Amy.
<i>Forget it!</i>
<i>Then let the negotiations begin.
I propose we go out on 1 0 dates.</i>
- How about zero?
- Nine.
- Zero.
- Seven? Eight?
Please? Kif's the sweetest guy
who ever liked me.
Five, and that's my final offer.
Four!
- One.
- Two.
- Half.
- I'll take it.
<i>We'll meet you for part of dinner
and half of a movie.</i>
Sir? I don't go out on many dates.
What if I don't know what to say?
Here's my book of pickup lines.
Say as many as you can,
as fast as you can. Don't stop.
- I'll just give her these flowers.
- Wrong, wrong, wrong.
And what's that? Candy?
Candy's for dorks. Give me that.
- Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.
- Thanks.
Well, well. This looks to be
one disturbingly erotic date.
Half-date.
- A bottle of wine.
- Half-bottle.
- And oysters on the half-shell.
- Quarter-shell.
- And I'd like...
- He's not hungry. It's expensive.
I'd like two steaks, and the ladies
will have sensual salads...
...with low-cal sensual dressing.
Thank you.
Kif, you haven't said a word
all night.
Well...
Hello.
Because I was really hoping
we could talk and stuff.
"If I said you had a beautiful body...
...would you take your pants off
and dance?"
- What?
- Lieutenant Kroker!
"I find the most erotic part
of a woman is the boobies."
This half-date is entirely over.
Amy? Conference.
Is there nothing we can do?
There's one way into a woman's heart
and parts beyond.
I speak, of course, of karaoke.
My years in the Duke Boys' Chorus
will not have been in vain.
All right, enough lipstick.
Let's storm out.
Oh, that's so emotional!
Amateur hour's over.
Let me show you why they call me
"The Velour Fog."
Hit it.
- Give us a break.
- He sickens me!
We're going home.
Call us a space taxi.
No need. There's not a
restaurant built I can't fly.
Where to, ladies?
Please, sir.
Let's just divide up the check, and...
Let's see what this eatery can do.
She's built like a steak house,
but she handles like a bistro.
She's out of control!
You win again, gravity!
Look! My new shell catalog!
So, let's try some on, already!
<i>Ah, muy macho.</i>
Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido
to ruin your drinking water!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm Mexican, and I find that offensive!
You Latins are so hot-blooded.
This one's like a summer guy!
The Planet Express health plan only
covers one kind of replacement shell.
I can't believe Leela and Amy
aren't back.
I'm gonna call the restaurant.
<i>The number you have dialed
has crashed into a planet.</i>
- We gotta go rescue them!
- I don't know.
<i>Bender, think of the seńoritas!</i>
<i>Vámonos!</i>
So, Amy...
- It's always a line with you.
- What planet is this?
- This whole sector is uncharted.
- It is not. You lost the chart.
Well, nothing to do but repopulate
the human race, just me and you.
And maybe you.
What is it?
- Me hear people, but me not see.
- Everybody make mistake.
Well, hello.
I usually don't say this...
...but you are the most beautiful trio
of gigantic ladies I've ever seen.
I find the most erotic part
of a woman is the boo...
Oh, no.
Any sign of Leela or Amy?
No, but what do you make of this?
I don't know, but it might have
something to do with this.
Oh, your God!
Move. Go.
All right. Here's the plan.
What kind of moronic plan is that?
Wow.
Women go free. Men stay in chains.
We take them to our leader.
She know what do.
A female leader?
- Fry, shut up!
- Yes, captain.
This capital city, planet Amazonia.
- Where are all the men?
- Men die out many year ago.
They were probably nagged to death.
Are you with me, fellas?
Here stadium, where women
basketball teams play.
- No can dunk, but good fundamentals.
- That more fun to watch.
Oh, God, you're killing me.
God, you're killing me!
This our comedy club.
Humor different here.
It not reinforce stereotypes.
Comedy come from character,
not abstract craziness.
Translation: boring.
That's a good one.
- This planet sounds better and better.
- I'm already looking for apartments.
Here live vengeful, all-knowing
leader. She decide men's fates.
- Is she hot?
- Not important. She all-knowing.
In other words, no.
- All hail Fem-puter.
- All hail Fem-puter!
- You obey a big computer?
- Yes. It appeared at time men die out.
- Why did you make it your leader?
- It different kind of politician.
Not beltway insider.
Fem-puter, we bring offering
of bath beads and scented soaps.
<i>Your gift pleases Fem-puter.
Why are there men on her planet?!</i>
<i>- It was an accident.
- That does not fem-pute.</i>
<i>Fem-puter will return
after deciding your punishment!</i>
I'm through making fun of women.
I want them to help me.
Should we do something?
There's no hurry.
Yes. A little tighter.
Tighter.
Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?
Too hard!
- Men strange. You have them?
- I'm afraid so.
What they for?
You mean snu-snu!
We hear tell men used for snu-snu.
<i>All we have go on are ancient legend
and subscription to Cosmo.</i>
FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.
Silence! You want die
like last men visit Amazonia?
- What did they die of?
- Crushed pelvises.
- Yes!
- Thank you, Lord in heaven!
<i>After lengthy fem-putations,
I have decided the fate of the men.</i>
<i>Fem-puter sentences them to death...</i>
<i>...by snu-snu!
- Yeah!</i>
What are you, gay?
<i>Death to the men!
Death by snu-snu!</i>
- But the snu-snu part will be good.
- Baby, it'll blow your mind.
Be reasonable.
Sure, men are annoying,
and they wreck their planets.
But these men are sort of my friends.
They don't deserve to die.
<i>Perhaps men are not as evil
as Fem-puter thinks.</i>
They make fun women's basketball.
<i>What?! Did you explain how
good fundamentals make up...</i>
<i>...for their inability to dunk?
- Yes. They still laugh.</i>
<i>- The men must die!
- Too true, Fem-puter. You're so wise.</i>
Kill 'em all. Good riddance.
Did I mention I'm not a man?
I'm a manbot.
Understandable mistake.
You can let me down.
- He big jerk like man.
- Sure, but check the crotch. Nothing.
<i>Very well. Release him.</i>
<i>As for the others, take them
to the snu-snu chambers.</i>
- I'll miss you, meat bag.
- Me too, meat bag.
I never thought I'd die like this,
but I'd always really hoped.
<i>The Amazonians will be divided
into three groups.</i>
<i>The one called Zapp will be
snu-snu'd by the large women.</i>
<i>He that is designated Fry will be
snu-snu'd by the petite women.</i>
<i>And Kif,
as the most attractive male...</i>
<i>... will be snu-snu'd by the most
beautiful women of Amazonia.</i>
<i>Then the large women.
Then the petite women.</i>
<i>Then the large women again.</i>
<i>Initiate snu-snu!</i>
Before I die, I have to tell you I
didn't mean to say those awful things.
- They were all Zapp's idea.
- Really? Honest and true?
Yes. And that person calling
and hanging up was me.
I was just too nervous to say hello
because I love you!
Oh, Kif!
It Og's first time. Be gentle!
We've got to do something.
You can interface with the fem-puter
and reprogram it.
Maybe you can interface with my ass.
By biting it!
All right, I'll go.
- How Tonk look?
- Tonk look good. Me fat.
No, you look good. Tonk fat.
<i>Intruder! Stay away from
the mighty Fem-puter! Guards!</i>
Time to override the CPU
and reprogram this fem-puter.
<i>Stop it. Stop it!
Cut that out.</i>
<i>Cease hitting Fem-puter.</i>
You're no fem-puter,
you're a fembot.
It's true. I disguised myself
so I could rule the Amazonians.
- But why?
- Why? Why?
I came here from a faraway planet.
A planet ruled by a chauvinistic
man-puter that was really a manbot.
Have you any idea how it feels
to be a fembot...
...in a manbot's man-puter's world?
- What?
And now, meddling manbot, there's
the question of what to do with you.
We need rest. The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
- It time snu-snu!
- Can't we just cuddle?
- No!
- Oh.
We can't wait for Bender.
It's time for a woman's touch.
Me next snu-snu! Out me way!
Where go beautiful man?
Me want snu-snu!
- Kif, jump!
- My hero.
Me not get snu-snu. Get him!
Mighty Fem-puter!
Small girl steal green kissy-man.
<i>- We kill her now?
- Come back later. Leave me alone.</i>
<i>Yeah, get lost!</i>
I'm a scary fem-puter.
Release the prisoners.
<i>- And bring gold. Lots of gold.
- Why Fem-puter want gold?</i>
<i>You heard the man.</i>
<i>Come on, give me some of that.</i>
That's how I got my new shell.
It looks just like the one I threw out.
I found it in the same dumpster,
but this one had a live raccoon in it.
Pretty good story, eh?
Stick to someone else,
you windy barnacle!
The battle of the sexes
was only resolved...
...when a manbot and a fembot
realized they loved each other.
By the way, if she calls,
I'm not here.
All I know is, this gold says
that was the best mission ever.
- It sure was.
- Oh, yeah.
I had snu-snu.
So, Amy?
What do you want to do now?
Bendless Love
- Guidance system?
- Online.
<i>- Autopilot?
- Present.</i>
- Dark-matter indicator?
- Making a noise.
All systems operational.
Let's rock.
Gentlemen, I've completed
my report on the crash.
I'm not reading that!
Summarize it in one word.
Sabotage.
This is a normal L-unit. Without it,
space travel is the dream of a madman.
- Yep.
- It's an important unit.
And this, my friends, is the L-unit
I just removed from the ship.
That's not an L!
Unless you count lowercase.
You know we don't!
Whoever did this was strong. This
is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
It should look like this:
But, instead, it looks like this:
- Who would do that?
- Who could do that?
And by "that," I mean this:
It looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.
I'd better make a chart of suspects.
I'll draw a line with my straightedge.
Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe!
My edge has been bent!
My javelin too!
It's ruined!
Now we'll never beat Jupiter State!
My Slinky!
My cuddly little pet Slinky!
What's all the hubbub?
Even the professor's been bent.
Thank you for your sympathy,
talking square of linoleum.
I'll get you fixed up.
- That's fine.
- What did you do to the professor?
I bent him.
- Aha!
- It's Bender!
A bunch of stuff gets bent, so it must
be the robot designed for bending.
I know, we'll check last night's
surveillance tapes.
- Tapes?
- You've seen me naked?
<i>Last night's tape. It was right next
to Bathroom Bloopers Four.</i>
See? Nothing! I told you, losers!
Wait, there on the screen!
It's that guy you are!
- I'm sleepwalking!
- We've got robots on the ceiling.
You weren't sleepwalking,
you were sleep-bending.
This is quite a shock.
On the other hand, it's not surprising.
After all, I've been bending
since the day I was built.
<i>I was born on an assembly line
in the bad part of Tijuana.</i>
Mama.
Hooray! I graduated!
Time to bend around Europe for
a few months, then get a job bending.
- You remember your birth?
- It was only four years ago.
- You're only four years old?
- Precocious little scamp, ain't I?
Bender must have a need to bend
that's not satisfied by his lifestyle.
He can't stay. He's a menace to every
straight person in the company.
Go satisfy your bend-lust.
And don't you come back
to work until you do!
<i>No more bending, no more work
Give us a raise, you big fat jerk</i>
Nevers!
Yo! The mafia supports you!
But don't tell no one! Spread the word!
As duly elected mobsters
of this union...
...it's our duty to support
the struggle of these slobs.
- What if management is "intragnizent"?
- In context, it's clear what you mean.
In that case, Clamps may have
a surprise for them.
The clamps!
Right?
Aw, no! A strike?
Now I'll never get to bend anything!
Oh, woe is Bender!
Management refused to switch
casual Friday to Monday.
- What?!
- They hire scabs at 1 0 times our wage!
Ten times normal wage!
I'll give those jerks what for!
- Welcomes aboard, scab.
- Great to be here.
I'll introduces you to your scab
coworkers you'll be scabbing with.
This here's our
scab foreman.
- Flexo?
- Bender?
Sorry you got sent to that South
American Turkish prison instead of me.
You bastard! They treated me like
an animal! And that's what I became!
No, you're all right.
Good to see you!
And here's another scab
what also works here, Angleene.
Hello.
Hey, you guys want
to move that things?
Hello!
<i>- Give us a raise, you big fat jerk
- Nevers!</i>
- Hi, Angleene. What you up to?
- Making hangers.
- Counselor said I had a knack for it.
- That's cool.
So, I was wondering if...
You know, it's cool if not, but...
- What are you doing after work?
- What I always do. Jack squat.
Me too. Man, we have a lot
in common, huh?
Well, we are made of virtually
identical components.
Are you sure? Maybe I should
peek at your access panel.
<i>Hey, according to the Scab Handbook,
that's inappropriate banter.</i>
And that's just
the way I like it.
Haile H. Selassie!
There, little friend. Good as new.
What an exquisite day! That azure sky.
The verdant treetops.
Those delightful birds with their chirp,
chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.
I've never seen you so cheerful.
What's wrong with you?
Seeing things from a new perspective
has reminded me of life's beauty...
...or perhaps my posture is causing
blood to pool in the back of my brain...
...resulting in a mild delirium. By
the way, you have a dime up your nose.
I wish. It's a nickel.
Union forever! Lousy scabs!
They can't do those things! Et cetera!
I bet watching me bend girders
turns your legs rubbery.
My legs are made of rubber.
And anyway, I am just
as strong as you are, Mac.
Oh, yeah? Prove it.
Here. Let me help you.
My new bent outlook
has completely re-energized me.
I'm even dating a young,
Brazilian, retired actress.
Some say I'm robbing the cradle,
but I say she's robbing the grave.
Howdy, doodies! What's new?
I was regaling your former coworkers
with a tale of bedroom antics...
Big whoop, no one cares.
I got Bender-related news.
I'm in love. And I'm taking
all my friends out to celebrate.
Let's get liquored up!
Hey, look at this crowd.
You guys gotta try the pasta.
It's got a nice profit margin. Bam!
So, special occasion tonight?
- You'll never guess what's happened!
- Bam?
- I've met the most dynamite lady-bot.
- Hey, that's terrific!
To celebrate, I'm gonna stick
seven copies of my book on your bill.
Bless you, sir.
So, Bender, tell us about
this new girlfriend of yours.
I intend to, through
the lost art of the toast.
To Angleene. She's got it all.
Looks, charm and the love
of a fabulous bending robot.
She sure does.
Flexo!
Careful, that's a week old.
I finally meet a nice girl,
with legs that don't quit...
...and that jerk Flexo
steals her away?
It's time to kick some shiny,
metal ass!
You degenerate hussy!
I'm disappointed in you too, Angleene!
- Bender, it's not what you think!
- God, then it's worse than I think!
Now look, there is no reason
to be upset.
- Flexo and I are divorced.
- Div... Huh?
We're just having dinner
to stay friends.
I knew that. What I'm outraged
by is your choice of wine!
- Really, it's the steward's fault.
- Excellent choice, sir.
That Flexo, why, I'm knocking him
on his butt. I can't believe this.
Obsessing won't help, Bender.
Take a lean back and enjoy life.
My fembot may be in love
with another manbot.
Well, talk to her. Tell her your
feelings in an honest way.
Either that, or be a man.
I've constructed an elaborate lie.
I'll call Angleene, pretend
to be Flexo, arrange a date...
...show up as him and catch her
two-timing me with myself.
That's thinking like a man.
Hello? This is Flexo.
Now we'll see who loves whom.
- Hey, hot stuff.
- Hey, Flexo.
Since when do you go to bars
on work nights? It's not like you.
Nonsense. It's exactly like me.
Flexo, the fun-loving love machine
fembots love to love.
I'll have a fuzzy navel. She'll
have the girliest drink in the house.
- Two fuzzy navels coming up.
- I hope they can change a fortune.
Get an eye-load of that scab with the
beard flashing his filthy scab money.
It's an insult, boss.
That cash should be slushing
my fund and kicks-ing my back.
- I'm greasing up my whoozits!
- Whoa. Not yet.
Let's just see if he does it
a couple more times.
- You're looking good.
- Quit making googly eyes.
- I'm in love with Bender.
- Bender? That walking wuss factory?
He may be a walking factory,
but he is no wuss.
You and me are through.
I told you when I divorced you.
Going through a divorce,
tell me that didn't bring us closer.
Care to dance?
You know I love dancing,
but you always hated it.
In that case, it's something
I've always wanted to make up to you.
Hey, Scratch-Mo!
Drop me and the lady
some rump-rattling beats.
I'd hoped by the second time he
flashed cash, my rage would subside.
Sadly, that has not happened.
You used to be so inflexible, Flexo.
You've really loosened up.
I recently upgraded my funk card.
- Come on!
- All right!
Hit me! Come on, now!
What's new?
Flexo, what's going on?
Flexo!
The moral of the story is: If you want
it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!
Yeah! You always were a kick
in the teeth, man.
Aw, shucks, thunder-buns.
You make me feel like a million volts.
Flexo, I'm starting to remember
why I fell for you in the first place.
<i>So she's falling for Flexo, eh?</i>
<i>I'd better seduce her a little more
just to be sure.</i>
It's late. I should get home
to my trailer.
I'll walk you out. A true gentleman
tends to his date's every need.
Tiparillo?
Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's
car around in the finest way possible.
He's flashing his cash again.
- How many times is that?
- Three!
That's the necessary number of times.
That scab's gonna have
an on-the-job accident.
Don-bot, I don't think we should
rely on an accident happening.
Let's kill him ourselves.
Well, good night. I had a great time.
How about a lift? To your place?
- What?!
- Admit it...
...you felt something for me tonight.
And by me, I mean Flexo.
- Hey, look. I had fun, but...
- But?
- But...
- But?
But...
- Huh? Bender, you tricked me!
- That's right, baby!
I ain't your lover-boy, Flexo,
the guy you love so much.
You even love anybody
pretending to be him!
Maybe I love you no matter
who you're pretending to be!
Oh, how I wish I could believe
or understand that!
There's only one reasonable course
of action now: Kill Flexo!
No!
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Nah, I'm joshing you.
- That was annoying.
- You call yourself divorced?
You're mocking one
of our oldest institutions!
What?
Give the word and I'll drop this
unbendable girder. Clamp-ka-bamp!
Only kill the one with the beard. That
other scab, we got nothing against.
That's low.
Please stop! I'm not worth it!
Probably not! But I love you, and I'm
gonna kick his ass till I win you back!
Okay, Clamps. Now!
Oh, that's gotta clamp.
- Flexo, are you okay?
- Yeah. Never better.
- I'm yanking your chain. I'm dying.
- You can't die!
- Bender showed me that I love you.
- But I love you.
I know, and I care for you too.
But I could never love anyone as much
as you made me realize I love Flexo!
But...
I love you so much, I want you
to be happy, no matter what.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying...
...I've got an unbendable
girder to bend.
You can't bend it.
It's unbendable!
I don't know anything about lifting,
so that just leaves us the one option.
Thanks. Another year under that
and I'd have been a goner.
I'll always remember this, Bender.
Me too. Me too.
Jerk.
Flexo and Angleene had sex
right on the factory floor?
- You got bending out of your system.
- Yes.
I won't be up to bending again
for a long, long time.
Perhaps it's your outlook
that needs a bend...
...a bend to a place where happiness
is perpendicular to wonderment.
- We're sick of your upbeat attitude.
- I'll say.
Nonsense. It's just like
in the song I wrote:
<i>We all need a new angle on life</i>
You've gotta help us.
I try to get out, but they keep
pulling me back in!
<i>Wangle a new dangle on life</i>
- No, the other way!
- I like him better this way.
- I'm sad now.
- It's fine.
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid
- Is Nibbler stoked for the show?
- He ought to be, with all the training.
Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham.
Roll over. Roll over for the ham.
You are so adorable. Who wants a ham?
Zooka barooka!
First prize is $500
and a year's supply of dog food!
- Five hundred dollars, you say?
- Dog food, you say?
That dog's gonna be hard to beat.
Look at him.
One sheep, two sheep...
...three sheep.
But our real competition
is the Hypno-Toad.
Your turn, Nibbler.
Herd those sheep!
Come on, Nibbler!
I have a late entry. My hard-shelled
whooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.
Faster! Faster!
Suck in that gut!
You wanna be spayed?
Silence, you cur!
Puff out that brisket!
I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
I love these things.
Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake.
He might be a little hungry. Usually,
he's had more ham by now. Shake!
Third prize, a party-sized keg
of guinea pigs, goes to...
...Dave Spiegel
and his owner, Fluffers.
Second prize, this lovely afghan,
made from an Afghan, goes to...
...Bender and his whooping terrier!
Second place? That's a fancy word for
losing! You didn't stick your landing!
- Forgive me, my friend.
- Never!
And before we announce the winner,
we have a special award for...
...Ms. Leela and her
mystery pet, Nibbler!
Me? Award?
Him? Me? Good?
That's the eloquence you'd
expect from the owner of...
...Dumbest Pet in Show!
And the grand prize winner:
The Hypno-Toad!
All glory to the Hypno-Toad!
Ah, maybe they're right.
Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
Don't listen to them. People said
I was dumb, but I proved them.
Good news. We were supposed to make
a delivery to the planet Tweenis 1 2.
But it's been completely destroyed.
- Why is that good news?
- They paid in advance.
- Excuse me.
- This is mighty strange.
First, Space Rome collapsed.
Then, Don Martin 3 went caflooie.
And now Tweenis 1 2.
- This planet is next.
- That's Earth.
- The planet we live on?
- I'd hate to be those guys.
What's got into him? He's twitching
like Zoidberg when you say "food."
What, now?
No! Nibbler, come back!
Too bad Nibbler's not around.
I'll have to eat this raw ham myself.
Nibbler?
Nibbler, you're scaring me.
Nibbler?!
Am I going crazy?
Have my years of hedonism
caught up with me?
Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here!
Nibbler? Could you scooch
the seat up, just a little bit?
- Leela back yet?
- Help me! My heart stopped!
- You don't have one. You're a robot.
- Sure. Right. Robot.
Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.
- Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
- Am I a robot?
I don't get this scam.
You already have my power of attorney.
Fry!
My skin!
I'm a genius!
Why is everyone acting so weird?
Zoidbee want balloon!
Want balloon now!
Zoidbee want go outside!
Oh, I just let you back in!
Unbelievable! I thought you were
a furry little moron.
But here you are flying an adorable
spaceship! If only you could talk.
Wait! I understood that!
You're transmitting your thoughts
directly to my brain?
You say those awful flying brains
are making everyone on Earth stupid?
Oh, stupider.
And you say we're headed
for your home planet...
...where you've lived since
the beginning of the universe?
So, how did the universe begin?
Then the meaning of existence...?
So every religion is wrong.
<i>You fell! Hi!</i>
<i>Some bad things happened.
One bad thing was...</i>
<i>... a train got crashed. Wanna see?</i>
<i>People won 't be late, though.
The governor said:</i>
<i>"I'm sending in more trains."</i>
<i>- Go!
- Wait for me!</i>
<i>Morbo can 't understand
his Teleprompter.</i>
<i>How do you say the letter that
looks like a man with a hat?</i>
<i>It's a T. It goes:</i>
<i>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</i>
Even the news monster
is acting strange. What to do?
I know! Let's play the lottery!
Let's buy Internet stock!
On margin! Zoidbee wanna buy
on margin!
Look at me! I'm invisible!
I know what's going on!
You've all become idiots!
- Hey! Let's all join the Reform Party!
- Oh, yeah!
Welcome back, ambassador to Earth,
homeworld of the pizza bagel.
I bear many receipts
for reimbursement.
The four welcomes to you as well, Leela.
We shall appear to be
speaking your language.
- Do not be afraid, child.
- I'm not afraid.
Uh, good. Good.
So, your real name is Lord Nibbler?
It is for your sake.
By the time you pronounce
one letter of my name...
...a trillion cosmoses would sink
into eternal night.
Oh, you're all so cute.
No, we are an ancient, powerful race.
Behold. When the universe
was forged in the big bang...
...our mighty race was
already 1 7 years old.
For the first millisecond,
things were okay.
But there arose a terrible enemy,
the Brain Spawn.
Ever since, we have waged
unceasing war against these dreadful...
Lunch is ready.
Then let the feast of 1 000 hams begin!
Why are these Brain Spawn
attacking Earth?
They hate all consciousness.
Thoughts screech at them like
the forced laughs of movie patrons.
Thus, they travel...
...making everyone stupid in order
to wipe out all thought.
Wipe out thought? My God!
They're flying televisions!
And even we are powerless
to stop them, fearsome though we are.
There is one being
who can resist.
A child of destiny whose bizarre brain
waves make him immune to their attack.
He is the hope of the universe.
The fate of your world, perhaps all
worlds, rests in his special mind.
Now, when you say "special"...
Attention New New Yorkers!
Stop acting so stupid!
<i>Fleet holding at perimeter of Moron
Zone, formerly known as Earth.</i>
Why would Fry be immune?
Because he doesn't shower?
They suppress intelligence
by attacking delta brain waves.
Every animal and robot generates
this wave, as do certain trees.
Fry, however, does not.
Somehow, he has cobbled random
brain waves into a working mind.
- Like a carpet-remnant prom dress.
- Like your prom dress.
The Brain Spawn are commanded by a
brain with a gooey center of pure hate.
Only Fry, with his superior,
yet inferior mind, can approach it.
Tell him to disable it.
We will do the rest.
- You can count on me.
- No.
- On Earth, you will be too stupid.
- That's why we wrote it down for you.
We also prepared
a bag lunch and mittens.
Time to reeducate you dunces.
We'll start with presidents.
This was our first president,
George Washington.
Let's review.
Who was our first president?
- A pickle jar?
- Thomas Jefferson?
Leela! I've been so worried!
Are you a bonehead?
I... have to tell...
...must... important... something...
You're going a mile a minute.
This... you for this!
Thanks!
No!
- Fire hot!
- The professie will help.
Fire indeed hot.
Oh, Chester A. Arthur fall down.
Brain. Brain make people dumb.
No, Leela. Brain make people smart.
- You go fight biggest brain.
- Even bigger than those?
- Where is it?
- I don't know.
A giant brain is
basically a giant nerd.
And where would a giant nerd be?
The library!
Pathetic human race.
Arranging knowledge by category
made it easier to absorb.
Dewey, you fool, your decimal system
has played right into my hands.
- What do you want?
- I'm here to kick your ass!
Wishful thinking. We have long since
evolved beyond the need for asses.
Odd. My stupefaction field
is having no effect on you.
That's right! You'll find a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing!
Better think of a new plan.
Come on, think.
Thinking. Thinking...
Oh! Stop that!
Thinking hurts him! Maybe I can
think of a way to use that.
Prepare to be thought at!
Leela, give me a topic.
I can't think of anything.
<i>Gotta find something.
Hardy Boys? Too easy.</i>
<i>Nancy Drew? Too hard.</i>
<i>Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!</i>
No! It's unbearable!
They're weakening.
Nibblonians to Nibble stations.
Prepare Cuddle Bug for deployment.
- Sometimes I fear we are cute.
- Oh, niggle-snooch.
Take that! This one I don't
understand. But take this one!
You have not won yet.
Each book is a gateway
to a mental realm...
...and I shall take you there
and imprison you forever!
Icky!
Where are we?
A gold doubloon to the man
who first spies the white whale.
- Big whale over there.
- I saw it first.
Wait! That no white whale!
It gray thinkie whale!
Let go of me! I have to kill it!
Farewell! You will all be trapped in
this dense symbolist tome forever!
Follow him! It's our only way out!
Have you seen a giant brain?
Yep. I let him help with the fence.
Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is
less fun than previously indicated.
Let this corny slice of Americana
be your tomb for all eternity.
- No!
- Come on!
Mr. Fry? Mama says
you're quite the oddity.
- A bachelor at your age.
- I'm an oddity? Wait till...
The most eligible landowner
in all Hartfordshire, Mr. Brainley.
I'm a gigantic brain!
- I say!
- Most ungentlemanlike.
What news have you
of the London season?
- Well...
- Hey, think fast!
I always think fast.
The whale! He be white now!
I've got an idea.
Stay here with Queequeg.
Is there a Mrs. Queequeg?
Yes! I'm free!
All right, brain! Get ready for
some electroshock treatment!
Fry, don't die! Wake up!
No!
"Leela cried as Fry lay dead
under the heavy bookcase.
The Big Brain laughed in triumph.
Then, for no reason, he left Earth
forever. The End. " There!
Now he's trapped in my book,
full of plot holes and spelling errors.
The Big Brain am winning again!
I am the "greetest"!
Now I am leaving Earth for no "raisin"!
The Big Brain is defeated.
Let what must be done, be done.
Me... feel... a bit better
in cognitive faculties.
I did it!
And it's all thanks to the books
at my local library.
<i>And so, life returned to normal.</i>
<i>Or as normal as it gets on this
dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes.</i>
<i>The people of Earth had no memory
of what had transpired.</i>
<i>Except Fry. And no one believed him
or cared what he had to say.</i>
<i>I returned to my post, ever-vigilant,
lest Earth again come under attack.</i>
<i>And when that day comes,
God help us. God help us all.</i>
Time for a diapie change.
<i>End transmission.</i>
That's Lobstertainment
So I says, "Super Collider?
I just met her."
And then they built the Super Collider.
Thank you. You've been great.
Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen.
Our next standup's a veteran
of four comedy traffic schools.
Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!
All right!
- Yeah!
- All right!
Earth. What a planet. On Earth,
you enjoy eating a tasty clam.
On my planet,
clams enjoy eating a tasty you!
Maybe I'm not loud enough. On Earth,
everybody is looking for a squid!
On my planet...
Reload.
So these three parasitic worms
bore into a human's head.
And they walk up to the bar
and then...
Wait! Stop! I've got more!
My whole life I worked on that act.
- And they hated it.
- You're a crazy lobster doctor!
- You shouldn't be a comedian!
- But comedy is in my valves.
My Uncle Harold was a big star
back in the era of silent holograms.
- Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
- This I cannot deny.
Why, I've been a fan since back when
my hips were made of bone!
As it happens,
I still have some of my original 78s.
He's a lot funnier
than you could ever be.
Maybe, but perhaps if I wrote him
and asked for a few hundred pointers...
This letter has to be very personal,
so I'm writing it in my own ink.
<i>"Dear Uncle Zoid,
Greetings from your nephew.</i>
<i>Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy?
Remember?</i>
<i>Now I'm the most important doctor
at the company where I work.</i>
<i>But my life is bereft of laughter. "</i>
"I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle.
Teach me the comedy business.
Sincerely, Zoidberg."
Isn't that nice?
- What's that scribble-di-gook?
- It's a letter from my rich nephew...
...who just might be my ticket out
of this flophouse, he might.
Yeah, you'd better run!
"Dear Rich Doctor Nephew,
I can help you be funny.
The first funny thing
you must do...
...is put your money in check form
and come to Hollywood."
"Sincerely, Harold Zoid.
P. S: cashier's check."
Did you hear that?
I'm going to Hollywood!
Welcome to Hollywood!
I must warn you...
...there's no refund if you get
discovered and leave the tour.
I'm kidding. That never happens.
Now, to your right, you'll see
30th Century Fox Studios.
Fox uses searchlights
to blind pilots...
...then film
the resulting plane crashes.
- Neat!
- Ahead...
<i>...you'll see the home of Mel Gibson,
star of the hit film Bravehead.</i>
Do we have any fans of Calculon...
<i>...star of the robot soap
All My Circuits?</i>
I am! Me! Bender is!
Then you'll want to get a close look
at his Bel Air home.
Yes, I will.
- Are you my hot-water heater?
- No.
- We met once. Remember?
- Absolutely not.
Remember I was bugging you a lot?
- You remember, right?
- Look, I'm programmed to be very busy.
Unless you can heat water
to 21 2 degrees, I'm not interested.
Have you got an extra GOTO 1 0 line?
I don't need a Bender.
That was the other guy.
My name's Boiler.
- Nice work, Boiler.
- Thanks. And call me Bender.
That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid
to discuss my dreams.
Next time you see me,
don't be surprised if I've eaten.
Uncle Zoid! You look young enough
to be thrown back.
Rich nephew!
Come over here and give your uncle
a nice, big meal.
So, here we are.
A still-famous film comedian...
And a rich, respected doctor
with surviving patients.
Eating in a restaurant,
as we both often do.
- So, you want to be a comedian, is it?
- It's my lifelong dream.
That dream dies now!
You're unfunny and untalented!
That's why you're perfect for drama!
Serious drama?
Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.
I'm putting together
a big drama picture as we speak.
The script is dynamite!
I know because I wrote it myself.
By directing and starring...
...I'll be back on top
after 50 miserable years...
...of fame.
- Ah, fame.
- Where do I come in?
- This film has a juicy part for you...
...if you completely finance it
with your money.
So, are you in?
Okay. How much do I have to invest?
Not much. Not much.
A million dollars.
Then it's settled.
Another big Hollywood deal!
- What can I get you?
- Is bread free?
- Yeah.
- We'll split an order.
- What's with Monstro?
- He promised his uncle a million bucks.
I've been here a day,
and already I'm a Hollywood phony.
Perhaps I could call on
TV's Calculon to help...
...now that I'm in show biz.
- Since when have you been in the biz?
- Long enough, little man. Long enough.
I would be remiss
if I didn't bring you scripts...
...that can make you
an international film star.
Tell me about the project.
- It's a movie.
- Interesting. Tell me more.
Get this. For a scant
$ 1 million investment...
...you can be the star.
And?
- And it'll win you an Oscar.
- An Oscar, you say?
That would get me out
of television once and for all.
Let me see the script.
No. No, I don't like the font.
Wait! Harold Zoid?
- Was this written by the Harold Zoid?
- Written and xeroxed.
Good heavens. A chance to work
with the legendary Harold Zoid!
He's one of my idols!
- You can guarantee me the Oscar?
- I can guarantee anything.
- Then I'll do it!
- Hooray!
Here's your checkbook!
Ladies and gentlemen,
our director...
...the legendary Harold Zoid!
Thank you.
A more classic movie plot there isn't.
A son doesn't want to follow
in his father's business.
And that business is being
president of Earth.
The son is vice president.
That makes sense. Wink, wink.
- You said, "Wink, wink."
- No, I didn't. Raise middle finger.
Now, remember, I can't stress
this enough, this is a talkie.
So I want the full gamut of emotions
from every actor in every scene.
<i>The Magnificent Three.
Scene one, take one.</i>
And action!
Take back your gilded pen, Father.
Signing bills into law was
always your dream, not mine.
Cut! Cut it!
I said this is a talkie!
You've got to emote more!
And you extras? Wave your arms!
What is this, a morgue?
<i>The Magnificent Three.
Scene 1 0, take 95.</i>
Action!
And I mean circus-grade action.
Sir? I call upon you,
not as a president...
...but as a father!
Cut! Cut it!
Would you show a little emotion?
People, please.
Just because it's a dramatic scene...
...doesn't mean you can't
do a little comedy.
Throw a pie, for God's sake!
No!
Cut! Cut it! Look, it's all right, kid.
We'll get it in editing.
That's a wrap!
I'm gonna see you at the premiere!
Which is...?
Editing is a long
and expensive process.
We spent all the money on pies,
so it'll be ready Friday.
Nice turnout. That Oscar's
practically on your mantel.
I just pray they like me
half as much as I do.
I agreed to be your vice president!
But I never agreed to be your son!
- Thank you, Lieutenant Smith.
- Good morning, Mr. Vice President.
We're missing it! My life's goal
is to attend a Hollywood shindig.
- Pay the valet the 2 bucks.
- No!
It's the principle of the thing.
I see a parking lot ahead.
I have asked you to join me
on the White House roof...
...so we could have
a heart-to-heart talk.
I'll never follow in your footsteps!
Here is my resignation
as vice president!
No! My son will not shame me
like this!
I would sooner die, I would!
Father! The ledge!
The president is dead.
Congratulations, Mr. President!
No!
- He's a visionary!
- Everyone walked out. They hated it.
Plagues have had better
opening nights.
You said the Oscar
was practically mine!
That's why I used the qualifier
"practically."
You listen to me.
I'm out a million bucks!
Get me that Oscar,
or you're dead!
You and these sniveling lobsters!
Dead, you hear me? Dead!
Oy! Now he emotes.
Four hundred categories
and not a single nomination for me.
- But you won this Golden Globe!
- That's the Emmy of movie awards!
- I want an Oscar!
- Then maybe you should act better.
It's not about acting...
...it's about earning the respect
of the creative community!
- We could rig the awards.
- That's fine!
It's no use. The tar is too thick.
Plus, I think I flooded it.
Well, we're gonna die.
We might as well enjoy the sights.
Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!
This is where you live?
I thought you were a movie star.
No, I'm not.
I'm an even bigger liar than you!
My career went down
the day they invented Smell-A-Vision.
Calculon's gonna kill us.
It's all everybody else's fault!
All I wanted was for people to think
of me one last time before I die.
What are you talking about?
Everybody remembers Harold Zoid.
As a pathetic has-been
and forgotten relic, they remember me!
It's better to die now.
No! This is one death
I won't be responsible for.
Zoidberg away!
Hi. I'm Joan Rivers' head.
I've had so many face-lifts, they
finally lifted it right off my body!
It's true! It's true!
Here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA,
reconstituted in a gorilla body!
Catering.
Here's washed-up actor
what's-his-name, Harold Zoid.
Are you presenting one of the awards
or getting one?
I'm a seat filler.
My only marketable skill
is to occupy space.
The second I don't win that award,
you're cat food.
Right, Boxy?
<i>And now, the host of the 1 07 4th
Academy Awards...</i>
<i>... Billy Crystal!</i>
Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels.
Oh, you like that one, Jack?
All right.
We're already one hour behind.
Our first award tonight,
Best Cinematography.
You want to play tic-tac-toe
before we eat our shoes?
Oh, I knew I'd die
at the bottom of a pit.
But a pit full of tar?
What was that? A tar dolphin?
Or a tar shark?
It's some kind of hollow tube
devoid of human life.
The L.A. subway!
We can blast our way in and escape!
All right, but I still feel like
having a shoe.
- What category is it?
- They're giving out minor awards.
- They're up to writing.
- That leaves Best Product Placement...
...and Best Actor.
There's no time.
And the nominees for
Best Product Placement are:
<i>Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation.</i>
<i>They Call Me Mr. Pibb.</i>
<i>And Snow White and the 7 Ups.</i>
And now to present the award
for Best Actor...
<i>... a bit player in the flop movie
The Magnificent Three...</i>
<i>... Dr. Zoidberg.</i>
Okay, Boxy.
Keep your prong on the trigger.
And the nominees
for Best Actor are:
<i>Sir Lawrence Ooooo
in The Merchant of Venus.</i>
<i>Hive Mind Gamma Seven X
in Bikini Party Summer.</i>
<i>The Soda Machine Robot
in Bikini Party Summer.</i>
<i>Mark Jones
in How Beige Was My Jacket.</i>
And, instead of the fifth guy,
Calculon...
<i>...for his powerhouse performance
in The Magnificent Three.</i>
- He read the wrong name.
- Play along, like with Marisa Tomei.
Hooray! I won't be murdered!
I'll live another day!
Another day of...
...pathetic, forgotten misery.
And the winner is...
And the winner,
instead of any of the nominees...
...is the legendary Harold Zoid!
What?
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Through my ups and downs...
...I thought the most important
thing in life was to win an Oscar.
But tonight I realize what's
really important is to win two Oscars!
I'm kidding.
What matters in life
is that people care about you...
...whether it's a whole crowd...
...or just one die-hard fan.
Thank you, nephew.
Now I can die happy...
...1 0 seconds from now,
when Calculon kills us.
- Harold Zoid!
- Hit the deck!
- Where's that Oscar?
- Here. Enjoy.
Why are you upset? It's less
fraudulent for you to have it.
Yes. Yes, it's a real beauty.
Someday I hope to win one of my own.
Then you're not gonna kill us?
I respect and admire Harold Zoid
too much to beat him to death.
Yeah!
Earthquake!
Hit the deck!
Let the earth quake!
I've got somebody's Oscar!
- We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
- I'm sorry. This is a private...
Oh, pardon me.
I see you're with Mr. Stallone.
Birdbot of IceCatraz
Those cookies are fresh-a-licious,
but they produce a lot of trash.
That head spray makes
your antenna smell nice.
- Thank you.
- But it's damaging the planet.
So? It's not the only one we've got.
Good news! I'm sending you
on an extremely controversial mission.
- Controversial?
- Oh, my, no.
<i>For this highly controversial mission,
you'll be towing the Juan Valdez...</i>
...an orbiting supertanker
full of Colombian dark matter.
Oil? What if we hit something,
and the tanker leaks?
lmpossible.
The tanker has 6000 hulls.
So, unlike me,
it's entirely leakproof.
Once you've hauled the tanker
past the protestors...
- Protestors?
- Correct. Six thousand hulls.
Why do we fly within three feet
of this penguin preserve?
To avoid the tollbooth.
She's restocked with emergency jam.
Let's get going.
At the risk of sounding negative, no.
I can't participate in this mission.
What are you yapping about?
Your reckless disregard
for the environment!
I'm gonna join those protestors.
This is an outrage. I demand you
hand over your captain's jacket.
This is my normal jacket.
I've had it 1 0 years.
I said, hand it over.
Well, Fry, or should I say
Captain Fry?
No, I shouldn't.
Bender is the new captain.
- Bender?
- That's right.
Being captain
is about intuition and heart.
A good captain can't have either.
That's why cold, logical Bender
is perfect for the job.
I do think of human life
as expendable.
No fair!
Leela was training me to be captain.
She let me sit on her lap and steer,
in this comic I drew.
The new one's out!
The title of captain
may inflate the human ego...
...but it's beneath the notice
of my mighty robo-logic.
Now, look spry, men.
We launch at six bells.
Greetings. I'm Free Waterfall Sr.,
founder of Penguins Unlimited.
No applause.
When you clap your hands...
...you kill thousands of spores that'll
someday form a nutritious fungus.
Just show your approval
with a mold-friendly thumbs up.
Please hold your thumbs until the end.
It's time to stop that tanker
with a nonviolent human circle.
Why resort to nonviolence?
Can't we kick their asses?
Little lady, those people's asses
are living things too.
We're hitched up tighter
than Davy Jones' U-Haul.
- At ease, men.
- I am at ease.
I like to give my first mate
an informal nickname.
From now on,
you'll be known as Wiggles.
The hell I will. Have you even read
the captain's handbook?
I have now. What's Peter Parrot's
first rule of captaining?
"Always respect
the chain o' command," captain.
Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned
an invitation to the captain's table.
The captain's table? What an honor.
Our peace ring has them trapped
like a tiger in a washing machine.
- Get ready.
- Look at that. Here they come.
Didn't you realize spaceships
can move in three dimensions?
No, I did not.
That tanker gave us the slip,
but we'll stop them here on Pluto.
If you're cold, rub your bodies with
permafrost. It's nature's long johns.
If rubbing dirt in your crotch
is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
This here is our penguin preserve.
They're so cute, like if puppies
and kittens could have babies.
We use hand puppets around young ones
to simulate a natural environment.
That's adorable.
It's this medal I'm most proud of.
I won it for saving the children
of Earth from a giant kangaroo.
It was on Australian news.
You didn't see it.
- Brilliant.
- Would you cram a sock in it?
Those aren't even medals. They're
bottle caps and pepperoni slices.
Thank you, steward.
Weren't you about to toast
your gallant captain?
Fine, I've got a toast.
To Captain Bender. He's the best...
...at being a jerk, and his ugly face
is as dumb as a butt.
I've heard better.
If I were in charge,
I wouldn't treat you like this.
You're nothing but a blowhard.
Sir, you forget yourself. Shut up.
Being captain is more important to you
than being my friend. I'm going.
Going? But a captain can't drink
without his first mate.
- You can drink with me, maybe?
- I don't feel like drinking.
Then if you'll excuse me...
...I see some ravioli
that only has two shoe prints on it.
Three.
Please have some liquor.
Robots need alcohol to function.
I once knew a guy...
You look like him.
He wasn't neither...
- I'm a good captain.
- Please, I love you like a father!
Oh, I hope they read my sign!
- Bender's too low and upside down.
- He must be talking on a cell phone.
- What's happening?
- All 6000 hulls have been breached.
Fools. If only they'd built it with
6001 hulls. When will they learn?
<i>Continuing our coverage of a tragic,
but faraway, story.</i>
<i>The crisis on Pluto worsens
as dark matter spreads.</i>
<i>The images are truly horrific.</i>
<i>I don 't think any of us can understand
how those poor penguins feel.</i>
<i>Oily humanoid.</i>
<i>At the time of the crash, the captain
had an alcohol level of. 08 percent...</i>
<i>... well below the legal limit
for robots.</i>
As your lawyer, I declare y'all
are in a 1 2-piece bucket of trouble.
But I struck you a deal.
Five hours of community service...
...cleaning up that mess.
Five hours? Couldn't you have
just gotten me the death penalty?
I'd have done better,
but it's hard pleading a case...
...while awaiting trial
for incompetence.
Good luck with that.
Now, you stay away
from those Puffin twins.
To avoid frostbite,
put your hands between your buttocks.
That's nature's pocket.
- I'll check on Bender.
- Watch so he doesn't pick your pocket.
Can't beat fresh-squeezed.
Bender, can you at least pretend
you're being punished?
Clean the black parts too.
Are they black with white feathers...
...or white with black feathers?
- Don't matter. They're all beautiful.
Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here.
What's this?
Man, he got away.
This is why chief says no hugging.
Good work, everyone.
I suggest you get some sleep.
I'm gonna stay up singing songs about
penguins in a fine, piercing tenor.
Has anyone seen Bender? Bender!
Here robot, robot, robot.
Why weren't you Kong donkeys
cleaning up?
They sent us inside
for doing an unsatisfactory job.
- And eating penguin eggs.
- You ate most of them.
Where's Captain Bender?
Off catastrophizing some other planet?
- Damn it, Fry! He's still your captain!
- He didn't come back with the group.
- He didn't?
- No.
It's 20 degrees below absolute zero.
I better go find him.
Wait. Bender and I have disagreements,
but we're still friends...
...and I'm gonna show him
what that means.
To the ship.
Why don't you walk?
He was only 20 yards from here.
Madam, I am in command now.
Such a man. I'd follow him
to hell and back, I would.
What the...?
What's this water made of, ice?
Forget this!
I don't think we're on Pluto.
We may have left space as we know it.
Then where are we?
- You said you knew how to navigate.
- Stop yelling at me.
It's worse than we thought. It seems
dark matter is nature's sex drug.
It's like a mix of penguin estrogen,
penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly.
- It's making them ultrafertile.
- How ultra?
A garden-variety penguin
lays one egg a year.
Since the spill, our penguins
lay six eggs every 1 5 minutes!
Also, the eggs hatch in only 1 2 hours!
Also, the males are laying eggs!
This man has overgasped!
Soon, there will be too many
birds to count.
Before long, they will exhaust
their food supply and starve to death.
If only we hadn't flown penguins
to Pluto and dumped oil on them.
- Can't we stop them from multiplying?
- Yes. Thankfully, we have a plan.
- What is it? We'll do anything!
- Grab your guns.
I declare penguin hunting season
officially open!
Isn't there some way
to keep them from breeding?
Cold showers don't work
on Antarctic creatures.
Surely, a quick semipainless death
is better than weeks of starvation.
Well, I suppose.
But I joined Penguins Unlimited
to love penguins, not hunt them.
The two are one and the same.
Now, are you with us, or are you
gonna let innocent penguins suffer?
Oh, God, it's inhuman!
It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
That's a good old-fashioned gun.
Rifle check!
- Oh, yeah!
- Wee doggy!
You're enjoying this!
Look, if you have to shoot penguins,
you might as well enjoy it.
Sorry, if it's fun in any way,
it's not environmentalism.
- Really? How about blowing up dams?
- Yeah, that is fun.
Let's conservate!
It's been an honor to serve under you!
This is for their own good.
Don't leave orphans.
Gotta kill entire families.
They're so cute. No! You can do this.
It's like murdering a little butler.
I can't look.
Oh, no! What have I done?!
You poor little guy!
I'm so sorry l... Bender?!
Were you hiding out with these guys?
Of course not! Filthy ice rats!
Scat! Shoo!
What are you doing? Get away!
- They love you.
- Well, I don't love them.
I don't know why,
but when I look at their faces...
...it makes me want to puke!
In a good way.
Stop! Stop shooting!
- It's me! Leela!
- Sorry.
Why aren't you firing at them?
Don't you want to help them?
- Not this way.
- You're not a tree-hugging kook at all!
I don't know if shooting penguins
will help or not.
But the decision shouldn't be in the
hands of people who kill just for fun.
You may just be farming
some free-range truth there.
But we already made 200 pounds
of batter for penguin tempura.
- Okay, boys, it's them or us!
- No!
- Where did they...?
- Attack!
Make sure they use every part
of my body!
I'll avenge your death, son!
They used to be peaceful.
I suppose this was your doing?
I taught them if it ain't black
and white, peck and bite.
Now, to take off my tuxedo...
Guys, it's me, your lovable dictator!
If only we had a toboggan!
Faster! Faster!
Right, they can swim.
It's all coming back to me now.
- It's Fry!
- Wiggles?
At least it'll help
reduce their population.
Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.
- Permission to come aboard?
- Granted.
We can't take off without our captain.
And bring my toboggan.
- Were you able to help the penguins?
- Sure. I mean, not really.
Nature will work itself out.
It can't screw up any worse
than we did, right?
I don't know.
Quit worrying! Thanks to my influence,
those stupid birds will do just fine.
The Luck of the Fryfish
- Push, Mrs. Fry. You're almost there.
- Squeeze one out for America, honey.
Keep it down,
it's the 9th inning.
<i>Here's the 0-2 pitch to Crypool.
He's called on a strike three.</i>
Swing the bat, you bum!
- It's a boy with red hair.
- You saying my son's a commie?
<i>And Groady leans into the pitch.
It hits him. The Mets win.</i>
This is the happiest day of my life.
- Here's your baby.
- Okay, thanks.
- What should we name him?
- You pick. I picked dinner.
I was thinking of Philip,
after those screwdrivers.
That's a fantastic idea.
More morphine, please!
- Look, Yancy, it's baby Philip.
- I wanna be named Philip.
Me Philip! Me Philip!
Son, your name is Yancy, just like me,
and my grandfather and so on.
All the way back
to minuteman Yancy Fry...
...who blasted commies
in the American Revolution.
Philip, until I find a suitable
model of an ICBM...
...you'll have to make do
fearing this toy spacecraft.
Mine! Mine!
- Come on!
- Baby needs new shoes.
To hell with your baby.
I need those shoes.
<i>It's a dead heat. They're checking
the electron microscope.</i>
<i>The winner is Number Three
in a quantum finish.</i>
No fair! You changed the outcome
by measuring it.
- How did you do, Fry?
- I'll tell you when my horse finishes.
Bad.
We owned four horses
and two jockeys.
We just put a jockey out to stud.
He's perfect for you.
Hey, baby, ever do it in a suitcase?
Look, it's a centaur race.
Come on, come on!
Hey, Leela, how about a kiss
for good luck?
I meant tongue luck.
<i>The winner is Number Four, Steven.</i>
I've run over black cats
that were luckier than me.
Get your hot horse-burgers,
horse-fries, horse-cakes and shakes.
- Tongue straight from the horse's mouth.
- It all sounds good.
All our horses are 1 00% horse-fed
for that double juiced-in goodness.
I'll have a cholesterol-free
omelet with horse-beaters.
- How can I horse you, sir?
- I'll have a horse Coke.
- Horse Pepsi okay?
- Neigh!
- Hey! What are you doing?
- This.
Dear Horse God, I don't usually pray.
Sometimes I doubt you even exist.
But if you're willing to grant me luck,
please, stamp your hoof once.
Come on, Number Six. Move it!
Don't do that. What are you...?
It's contagious.
<i>And the winner is Harry Trotter
by the entire racetrack.</i>
That'll teach those horses
to take drugs.
That's it! You can only take
my money for so long...
...before you take it all.
I say, enough!
I've got one dollar left,
and this one I'm holding on to.
Oh, no, you don't.
I may not know about horses, but I
know lots about doing anything for $ 1.
If you think bad luck can defeat me,
you don't know my name is Philip J...
That is one unlucky guy.
Kareem has the sky hook,
but Philip J. Fry has the space hook.
Yancy drives, he goes up
with his patented space hook.
Hey! That's my patented space hook.
You stole it.
You're not the president of it.
Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover.
I'm dying of old age!
Game over! Phil wins.
Yancy's fans are stunned.
There'll be no celebration
at the Yancy Dome.
Lucky!
Someone's in a good mode.
Let's say I lucked out at the track.
Also I rigged one race.
I'd have won too, if I still had my
seven-leaf clover.
Plus, I'd still have my hair.
I got your page, Mr. Fry.
Your new hair is ready.
What happened to this clover?
I hid it in a secret place and never
told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
- So is it still in the hiding place?
- Yeah, maybe it is still there.
In the ruins of Old New York.
Helping one ant defeat another.
- Or giving luck to a piece of dirt.
- Dirt doesn't need luck.
I'm going to get my clover back!
Some of the tunnels have metal bars.
Who's good at bending?
- How about you?
- Sure.
- But Bending's my middle name.
- It is?
Yep. My full name is
Bender Bending Rodriguez.
Here's the entrance. From this moment,
I declare my bad luck officially over.
He was fun.
If we get bored looking for the clover,
I've got Tetris on this thing.
- Look, up ahead.
- Old New York.
The city that inspired
a casino in Las Vegas.
We've got Manhattan
all to ourselves.
I can finally do the crazy stuff
I always dreamed.
Howard Stern is overrated.
- Oops!
- New York is so burned.
Remember when Giuliani
cracked down on jaywalking?
Well, Rudy, how do you like
this action?
The big breakdance battle
is Saturday.
If we wanna win
Jam Master Jay's parachute pants...
...our crew has to pop,
lock and bust the freshest.
Noticeably F.A.T., drop us a beat.
- Name?
- Cosmic F.
- Style?
- Outer space.
- Special moves?
- The moonwalk.
The robot.
The zero G.
- Name?
- Cosmic Y.
- Style?
- Deep Space.
Deep Space?!
- Special moves?
- The space-walk.
- The robot.
- That's similar to mine.
The zero G.
- You totally ripped off my routine.
- You calling me a biter?
Why do you always have to steal
everything from me, Yancy?
- Stop illing. Word.
- I'd like to see you steal this:
The septuple head-spin!
He's just scratching. No one's done
more than a quadruple.
Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T.,
rewind the tape.
Crazy sucker.
- Phil, you're hot.
- That was ice-cold, bro.
Fry, if I ever see you try
anything that crazy again...
...this crew might just have
some new parachute pants.
Stop hogging the clover.
- Let's go find that clover.
- Which way to your house?
- The sign says we're at 71 st Street.
- 71 st Street? Never heard of it.
- Downtown could be in any direction.
- We'll just take a spin on the B-train.
That feels funny!
This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train,
stopping wherever I feel like.
Watch for the closing doors.
Wake up, buddy. End of the line.
My old neighborhood.
That's the bench where I found shirts.
We used to light that hydrant on fire!
On that corner, some guy
handed out a socialist newsletter.
- Was it poorly xeroxed?
- Oh, yeah.
The comedians were right.
This is different from L.A.
- Did you say you used to live here?
- That's right.
- Did you know Andy Goldman?
- He was my neighbor. Why?
- I mutated from him.
- What's he up to these days?
I'm teaching.
- He seemed nice.
- Sure, when he's sober.
Holy camolie! The house I grew up in,
it's still there!
Man, Father Time really took
a bat to this place.
That stupid clover is a worthless
piece of garbage. Give it!
Mom, help!
Yes!
- Yancy's trying to steal my clover.
- Yancy, stealing is wrong.
I'm gonna pile drive you.
You're dead meat!
What's happening?
Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?
Not yet, commander.
Yancy's trying to steal my stuff.
He better keep his hands
off these bananas.
Gonna need them when the radiation
turns us all into monkeys.
The Ronco Record Vault. Yancy will
never get his hands on you in here.
<i>The Breakfast Club soundtrack.</i>
I can't wait until I'm old enough
to feel ways about stuff.
Stay safe, clover.
I may need you again someday.
My dad spent years turning this
into a bomb shelter.
- Yet there was no nuclear war.
- What a waste.
This is it. My Ronco Record Vault.
I still remember the combination.
Three.
It's stuck.
The Achilles' heel of the Ronco design
is its structural resonance frequency.
There we go.
<i>- Here's The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
- You mean breakfast club sandwich?</i>
I hid my clover in the jacket
so my brother, Yancy, wouldn't get it.
Here goes.
It's gone! The whole place
has been cleaned out.
- Yancy stole my clover.
- How do you know it didn't disintegrate?
<i>- Everything else held up okay.
- Except Sports, by Huey Lewis.</i>
- My brother hated me so much.
- Brothers always fight.
He just never got a chance to say
he loved you before you got frozen.
You think? Because I always
kind of wished that...
- Who is that godlike figure?
- It's my brother, Yancy.
And there's my seven-leaf clover.
I knew he stole it.
If that's Yancy, why does
the inscription say Philip J. Fry?
Wait a second. That's my name.
Good Lord! He ditched his goofy name
and stole mine.
Apparently, this brave adonis,
this Cadillac of men...
...was the "first person on Mars."
- First person on Mars?!
That should've been me!
He stole my clover, he stole my name
and he stole my life.
- And now he broke my hand.
- His legend lives on.
You opened the vault,
and the clover was gone?
Nothing in there
but the best music of the 1 980s.
Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions.
The list goes on.
My brother stole my dream
of going into space.
- Now I'll never get there.
- You went this morning.
"First person on Mars."
So your brother was that Philip J. Fry.
- I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name.
- Shut up, friends.
My browser heard the word "Fry"
and found the Philip J. Fry movie.
It also opened my calendar to Friday
and ordered some french fries.
<i>Philip J. Fry, astronaut,
philanthropist, entrepreneur...</i>
<i>... was a great man,
truly worthy of narration.</i>
<i>Fry was the first man on Mars,
a feat never equaled.</i>
It should've been me!
<i>The ever-lucky Fry
made his fortune by striking oil...</i>
<i>... in the mansion
he had won in a lottery.</i>
That's my clover. He stole it!
<i>After a fling with
Icelandic supermodel, Njord...</i>
<i>... Fry scored many hits
with his band, Leaf Seven...</i>
<i>... known for their hypnotic rhythms
and memorable hooks.</i>
I'm known for that!
<i>Phil came and strummed out this tune.
And I said that's a number-one record.</i>
<i>Fry now spends most of his time in his
grave at Orbiting Meadows Cemetery...</i>
<i>... buried with his trademark clover
to bring him luck in the next life.</i>
That's where my clover is.
Is that cemetery near here?
- It will be in a couple of hours.
- Good, we're going grave robbing.
I'll get my kit.
Your tux will be perfect
for my wedding, Dad.
Yancy, that tux got me through
Nam in style.
- I wish your bother could see this.
- I remember the day he disappeared.
Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 1 7-9.
Oh, I miss him.
I was gonna rummage through
Phil's records to play at the wedding.
He may be missing,
but his crap sure isn't.
<i>Breakfast Club. This will clear
the room after the reception.</i>
He's buried in the world heroes
section? I'm impressed.
I should be the one in that grave!
We lost Bender.
Now no one will be able to say
I don't own John Larroquette's spine.
Aha! My brother's grave!
"Philip Fry, the original Martian."
It's all lies. He wasn't original.
He wasn't a Martian.
- He wasn't Philip. He wasn't a "the."
- You're twice the "the" he ever was.
It's clovering time.
- So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?
- I'm sort of thinking one.
Daddy has a present for you.
Know what it is? It's a lucky clover...
...to help you be successful,
even at breakdancing.
It belonged to someone very special.
I know what name you want
to give him. It's okay.
Really? Son, I'm naming you
Philip J. Fry...
...in honor of my little brother,
who I miss every day.
I love you, Philip.
And I always will.
"Here lies Philip J. Fry,
named for his uncle...
...to carry on his spirit."
Pay dirt! I got the clover, plus his
wedding ring. Sorry, ladies, I'm taken.
Hey, Fry, you want me
to smack the corpse up a little?
Bender, I think Fry
needs a moment alone.
Okay, grab a shovel. I'm one skull
short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
Cyber House Rules
<i>I gave the cookies you made
to the kids. They couldn 't believe it.</i>
<i>They were delicious. But, I digress.</i>
<i>Tremble, puny earthlings!
One day my race will destroy you all!</i>
Can one of you guys get that?
It's a doorbell baby!
Hello, little guy.
- I was abandoned as a baby too. So...
- Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.
- Bender, stop! It's a baby!
- A baby what?
It's just a card from
the orphanarium I grew up in.
<i>Leela, you're invited to a reunion...</i>
<i>... at Cookieville
Minimum-Security Orphanarium!</i>
<i>Please stand clear
of self-destructing basket.</i>
A reunion at your old orphanarium?
You gonna go?
No way, Jose-bot. I never want
to see those orphans again.
Not after the way
they used to pick on me.
One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
Nice depth perception, One-eye.
How can you make fun of me?
You're blind.
My eyes may not work,
but at least I got two of them.
That's terrible, Leela.
Imagine the look on their faces
when we eat all the hors d'oeuvres.
Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing
my success in a few faces.
Set a course for adventure!
What a dump!
Just like old times.
Gosh, the bars on the windows
seemed so much thicker back then.
Mr. Vogel, remember me?
Leela, you're worthless,
and no one will ever love you!
- You used to say that all the time.
- Oh, those were happier days.
The gristle in a blanket
isn't half bad.
Try the Popsicle sticks.
They've absorbed a lot of flavor.
Hey, look, it's our old group picture.
- I don't see you anywhere.
- That's me over in Cootietown.
Get a load of this
average-looking guy.
That's Adlai Atkins. I used
to have kind of a crush on him.
- One-eye! One-eye!
- Stupid as a French guy!
Well, it's time to say hello
to the old gang.
So, what you been up to
since you left?
- Living in a box. You?
- Selling kidneys, teeth, whatever.
And what am I up to, you ask? Why,
I'm a very successful space captain.
- Wow.
- How nice for you, Leela.
That's so good for a person
with one eye.
Hey, you can't feel sorry for me.
I'm a space captain,
and you're a bunch of losers.
Right, right. We're the losers.
Well, if it isn't old One-eye.
- Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane-boy!
- He can't hear you. He's deaf now.
Leave her alone.
She's leading a normal life.
She's not gussied up,
duded out or where it's at.
Now, run along.
Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never
outgrow being an eyeball. Oddball.
Nonsense. You're a captain.
That's a fine profession.
Well, it's just for a package
delivery service.
A package is just a box
until it's delivered.
I'd never thought of it that way.
What do you do?
- I'm a doctor.
- A tall doctor, you say?
Sir, you seem stable.
- Have you thought about adopting?
- No.
It's a great way to have
a kid without sex.
Really?
The government will help
with $ 1 00 a week.
A hundred dollars a week?
I'm so sorry I teased you.
Let me make it up.
- I'll fix it so no one teases you.
- By beating them up?
I broke that blind kid's nose,
and it made no difference.
No, I specialize
in phaser eye surgery.
I can build you a paraffin eye
and graft it on.
It won't be able to see, but you'll
look like a normal two-eyed person.
Me? Perfectly normal?
Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.
Why are they with you?
Do you have candy?
No. It's called parenting.
Come on, dumplings, we've got
1 2 government stipends to collect.
Our daddy's a giant toy!
Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea.
I'm sure Leela's tired of morons
gaping at her eye all the time.
Cosmetic surgery's great.
I used to be too cute...
...so I had cuteness reduction
surgery here and here.
You're crazy! Leela doesn't
need surgery. You look great now.
That's so sweet, Fry. But for once,
I just want to look normal.
You're better, you're abnormal!
You shouldn't care what people think.
I'll start by not caring
what you think.
I'm getting the surgery.
- Thattagirl!
- Wonderful!
You can also get an ink pouch
to help you escape your enemies.
That's the stupidest idea
I've ever heard, you imbecile!
Now we'll find out if the operation
was a success. Hold on to your hats.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is the wrong patient.
- Those eyes look so great on you!
- She looked fine before.
- No.
- Wrong.
Wow, look at me!
- I don't have the hang of blinking.
- You will.
I try not to blink too much, because
it's flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it.
I did it! I blunk!
Just in time
to screw up this picture!
Hooray!
I've never felt so unremarkable! Today
I actually blended in with a crowd!
- Kids, meet the jerk-bags I work with.
- Hello, jerk-bags!
- They're so cute! What are their names?
- Kids have names?
- My name's Nina, and his name's Albert.
- Now you're all named Bender Jr.!
Look! My first government
stipend check.
Twelve baby humans, 1 200 wing-wangs.
Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
What is it with you kids?
Every other day, it's food, food, food!
Oh, fine. I'll get you
some stupid food.
- Can we have Bender burgers?
- The cat shelter's onto me.
Hello, Leela.
I was getting one of my shirts toned
down, so I dropped in for your exam.
- That's handsome of you.
- Follow the light with your eyes.
Perfect. A guy could fall
head over heels for you.
- I'm interested myself.
- What are you saying?
I'm not good with words,
so I'm in a delicate conundrum.
- Will you go out with me?
- Sure.
I don't know what else to say, so I'll
just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.
This is so unfair.
I liked you as a cyclops.
- He's only interested in your eyes.
- You're just jealous.
No, I'm not! Wait, I am!
But my point remains valid!
I want to try dating a man,
who if you go somewhere with him...
...no one says he's crummy.
I deserve that once in life.
Be careful with that Adlai.
He's a doctor. They're poor.
- Most doctors are rich.
- When did this happen?
You're joking, right?
That's not funny!
They got everything you need:
Booze, peanuts, they got
a crapper in the back...
- That's something you do, right?
- Yeah.
Then knock yourself out.
Only eat and drink enough
to keep yourselves alive!
I'm trying to make a profit here.
- Daddy, Bethany's hitting me!
- Here.
- These kids yours?
- Yeah.
- I like a man with responsibility.
- That's me, baby.
Let me ditch the kids in an alley,
and we can go have some fun.
- Daddy Bender?
- Daddy's trying to score...
...with a cheap floozy right now,
so cram a Tinkertoy in it.
I love you, Daddy Bender.
- What the hell? Quit hugging me!
- I guess you're busy. Catch you later.
You morons! I've got half a mind...
...to hug each and every one of you,
and see how you like it!
Come on.
I'll take you someplace
no one could object to.
That sounds wonderful.
I'd like an extra-beautiful bouquet
for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
Average, please.
Adlai, I've had
a wonderful time today.
No one's stared at me or avoided
staring or tried to burn me.
You make me feel so not weird.
Leela, you're 999,999 in a million.
Thanks for coming to get
to know Adlai. Isn't he dreamy?
Totally.
Listen, I want you all to know
your Leela's one standard lady.
Oh, Adlai, stop.
What's wonderful about Leela
being normal? We aren't.
That's what makes us great.
Like Dr. Zoidberg.
- He's a weird monster who eats garbage.
- Damn right.
And the professor's a senile,
amoral crackpot!
- Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.
- Tally me banana.
Amy's a klutz from Mars.
- And you've got that brain thing.
- I already did!
Leela, do you want
to be like us or like Adlai...
...with no severe mental
or social problems whatsoever?
That's the dumbest question ever.
- She's right.
- Daylight come.
- Coming through. Watch your head.
- Help, I'm under attack!
Remember your manners. Forks in
the left pocket, spoons in the right.
Which one of you cutie muffins
gets the spicy squab?
Me.
- What do we say when you get something?
- About time!
That's my boy!
And here's your check. Bam!
I gotta go poopy!
You should've gone before
it was time to run.
Go! Through the kitchen!
You little crooks! If I catch you,
I'm gonna make cutie-muffin gumbo!
Seeing that robot force
children to do his bidding...
...makes me think about kids.
- Us? Me? You? Kids?
<i>It's time to stop living this
vida bachelor loca and have kids.</i>
Oh, Adlai. This is the most
beautiful moment of my life.
Daddy, I want a piggyback ride!
Daddy's tired. Let's just have
another dog pile on Fry.
- Tell us a story, Daddy Bender!
- Story!
- All right, fine. Gather around.
- Yeah! Story!
We want to hear this one again.
<i>"Bender's Arrest Record,
by the police.</i>
On March 3, at 2 p.m.,
Bender was caught shoplifting."
Yeah, show us the picture.
There he is!
It's 9:00, you know what that means.
Daddy's sick of looking
at you, so go to bed.
The grownups have to talk.
Come on, Ma.
Now to figure out how much money
I'm raking in off those kids.
- I need a calculator.
- You are one.
I mean a good calculator. Minus the
food, the bunny-rabbit wallpaper...
I get 1 00 bucks a kid,
and they're costing 1 1 0!
- There goes my cabinets.
- I won't go to another PTA meeting!
The kids have got to go!
- Daddy, how do I flush you?
- Just go to bed!
Doing this jigsaw puzzle
of a pacifier factory...
...makes me want children even more.
I was thinking. Since we're orphans,
maybe we should adopt a child.
Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable.
It's more than acceptable.
It's adequately satisfactory.
Imperial Dragon restaurant? I've got
a herd of you-know-whats for sale.
Let me check. Oh, aren't you a cutie.
About 35 pounds.
What?
Bender, we'd like to adopt a child.
This is the place...
...because Bender's Orphanarium
means discount orphans.
What do I have to do to send you
home with 1 2 orphans?
- I'm afraid we only want one.
- I'll show you what I got in stock.
I remember this.
They trot you out, and parents
judge you like a piece of meat.
- I'm Albert.
- Kind of fatty.
Then how about this little number?
Purebred human. No vampire in there.
If you're strapped for cash,
consider this unit.
Cursed with a third ear but full of
an emotion I understand is called love.
One time, I did 1 00 jump ropes.
I can't decide.
We have to think about it.
Grownups gotta talk now.
Time for bed.
- But it's 1 0 a.m.
- I said hit the hay!
- Oh, they're all so adorable.
- Yeah.
It's times like this I can
hardly bear to let them go.
Good night, you princes of Maine,
you kings of New New England.
You're under arrest
for child cruelty, endangerment...
...selling children as food
and faking the weight of livestock.
If you had kids of your own,
you'd understand!
Would it be all right
if we adopted a kid?
Might as well. They're gonna
rot in the evidence locker.
Nice ear!
Hey, freaky ears!
- I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
- But there's plenty of normal ones.
Come on, she could
really use a mom and dad.
<i>Ear-face, Ear-face
Sally won the ugly race</i>
They have a point.
She has an ear on her face.
So what? She may be different,
but she still deserves a good home.
If you want her, I'll give her
an operation to make her acceptable.
She doesn't need an operation.
She's fine this way.
- And you were fine the way you were?
- Damn right I was!
Shut up, Fry! Look, Adlai,
I'm proud to be different.
I wish I'd realized that
when I was her age.
I also have a tail.
Take me to the hospital
and put my eye back. Now.
Why should I do that?
By the end of the day,
one of us is gonna have one eye.
In recognition of Bender's
generous gift of 1 2 orphans...
...and a check for 1 200 wing-wangs...
...I hereby rename this building
the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!
It's good to have
the weird-looking Leela back.
You're a true friend. I guess there's
nothing wrong with being weird.
Leela, there's nothing
wrong with anything.
We'll miss you.
We know robots don't have emotions,
but we drawed you this picture.
So if you ever miss us, even just
a teeny bit, you can look at it.
Hey, I smoke a cigar,
not a candy cane.
Hey, what the...?
Get away! Come on! I just got
all the gum off of there!
I hate you! I hate you all!
<i>Futurama is brought to you

Insane in the Mainframe
Good news, everyone.
Today marks our friend Dr. Zoidberg's
1 0th year with Planet Express.
- Huzzahs are in order.
- Huzzah.
- Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
- I'll now read the mandatory speech.
"Dear Employee: Has it really been
5, 1 0 or 1 5 years?
If not, disregard this
and get to work."
Distribute token of appreciation
and applaud.
Look! Coupons! I can get
two oil changes for the price of one!
Now if I could only afford the one.
And the car.
Ah, the years. So many memories...
...so many strange fluids
gushing out of patients' bodies.
Yes, yes. Now here's
your pension statement.
It's empty because you haven't paid
into it, you dummy.
You kept track of it all these years.
I'm boned. I haven't paid either.
What'll I do when I retire?
- I thought you were retired.
- I don't see you planning for old age.
I got plans. I'm gonna turn
my on/off switch to off.
I'm gonna take action. It's time
to check my retirement fund.
Damn! Still only 1 00 dollars.
A penny saved is a penny earned. Also,
I need athlete's foot cream for my face.
He's right.
I must start investing wisely.
Well, down to my last lottery ticket.
Cherry. Cherry!
Mule. Crud!
You got six bucks left to retire on.
I recommend Tender Vittles.
You're opening a retirement
account for $6?
I'm sure a wealthy mule farmer like you
knows we charge a $ 1 0 monthly fee.
You gotta spend money to make money.
Here you are.
Your account is now overdrawn by $4.
I've seen lines move
faster in the sperm bank.
That's for sure...
Roberto, is that you?
Bender! Hey, man!
- You old lunatic! How you been?
- Not bad. Not bad.
Everybody on the floor!
This is a stickup!
I'm okay too. I'm taking a Chinese
cooking class at the Learning Annex.
- Cool. Can you give me a hand here?
- Sure thing, pal.
Hey, you! Red! Quit watering
that plant and get the door!
- Nice talking to you.
- Same here. You guys are all right.
- Here's something for your trouble.
- Thanks, buddy!
Freeze! You're under arrest!
Shoot them in the back!
Quick, while they're not looking!
Court is in session.
The Honorable Judge Whitey presiding.
The charge is bank robbery.
My caddie-chauffeur informs me...
...that a bank is where people
put money that isn't invested right.
Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount
to that most heinous of crimes:
Theft of money.
As the surveillance camera for that
bank the judge was jawing about...
...could you tell us what you
done seen that day?
Well, let's see. My memory's a little
fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:
Your Honor, I move
that I be disbarred...
...for introducing this evidence
against my own clients.
Mr. Fry, do you recognize the robot
hugging on you in this here hologram?
I sure do! That's the real robber...
...and I'll never forget his name as
long as I live. And that name is...
Just give a name! You don't wanna
look stupid on Court TV.
You're right. You're right. It was...
Yes? What?
You say if I testify I'll be killed?
Oh, it's for you.
And the other hamburger will also be
made of your lungs. So long, pal.
I won't testify on grounds that my
organs will be chopped up into a patty.
The 67th Amendment.
I may be a simple, country chicken,
but I know when we're finger-licked.
What if we plead insanity?
A few months in an insane asylum?
I could do it on my head.
If you start now,
it might help our case.
What evidence do you offer to
support this new plea of insanity?
- They done hired me to represent them.
- Insanity plea is accepted.
Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the
asylum for criminally insane robots...
...until you are deemed cured.
Yahoo! The system fails again!
And Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the
home for criminally insane humans.
That facility has been full since you
ruled being poor is a mental illness.
Order! The only poor people
I want to hear about...
...are those who tend to my pores
at the spa.
Send them both to the robot loony bin
and let's go.
Huh?
Ow, my head! Ow, my feet!
Ow, my head! Ow, my feet!
- Keep your chin up.
- Ow, my chin!
I don't belong here.
This is for insane robots.
Well, you meet half
the qualifications.
Oh, good! A physical!
Once they examine my fragile,
pink body, they'll see I'm not a...
What the...?
I find that offensive!
Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me
give you something to help you relax.
There's been a terrible mistake!
I'm human!
See? I'm all squishy and flabby.
Also, I complain a lot.
Yes, you do. You need to relax more.
Terrific. Now, consider
the following:
You were admitted to this robot
asylum. You must be a robot.
Diagnosis complete.
I do other human stuff. I age! See?
I'm Nurse Ratchet.
Please come with me, won't you?
We'll meet your roommate next.
His name is Malfunctioning Eddie.
The car dealer?
I guess his prices really were insane.
He's very excitable, so don't
say anything to surprise him.
- Pleased to meet you.
- We've met.
What?!
I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.
I'm a pretty girl.
- Someone had a busy day!
- My roommate exploded.
You gotta help me.
How can I prove I'm human?
- You could drop dead.
- I don't wanna!
- Hey. I believe you are a human.
- You do?
They don't believe I'm a human either.
Name's Unit 201 3.
Let me introduce you around.
Fry, meet Norm. Still picking up
CIA transmissions on your teeth?
They just won't stop!
<i>The CIA cafeteria menu for the
week of May 1 5th is as follows:</i>
<i>Monday, shepherd's pie...</i>
Cuckoo.
- Let me guess. He thinks he's Lincoln?
- He's supposed to.
Problem is, he's got multiple
personalities. All of them Lincoln.
I was born in 200 log cabins.
And this here is Frankie.
He thinks he's a lunchroom worker.
So they put him here.
- How's working the lunchroom?
- All right.
Poor Frankie.
Change places!
I can't take much more of this.
I want out of here!
Are you crazy? This is great.
Electroshock whenever you want...
...two Lincolns for every Napoleon.
Sweet light crude!
But I'm not a robot! I don't like
having disks crammed into me.
Unless they're Oreos, and only in
the mouth. Don't you see? I'll die!
Quit your bellyaching
and take it like a robot.
Change places!
They say you're making strides
with your exploding problem.
Well, the way I see it...
Get me out. I'd have starved if not
for that sick vending machine robot.
Give me! Give me!
Poor Fry. He's got the munchies
for freedom.
We're trying.
We petitioned the governor...
...but he doesn't want to appear soft
on those falsely imprisoned.
At least I have friends on the outside.
Bender's been no help at all.
No, seriously, I'm not.
You should be more ashamed than usual.
Lighten up, honey. I'm getting through
a difficult time using humor.
Visiting hours are over.
Time for our medication disks.
Help me! For God's sake, help me!
Don't worry, Fry. I too once spent
a nightmarish time in a robot asylum.
But now it's nearly over. So long.
Thirty days, September, April, June.
Peanut butter. What am I gonna do?
Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?
- You are being released.
- Finally! Sweet justice!
Sweet, juicy justice!
- Not you. Him.
- Me? What a surprise!
- Look! I barely exploded at all.
- We can control that with medication.
Fry? Are we ready to
meet our new roommate?
- Hi, Red!
- Roberto? What are you doing here?
- I got busted robbing that bank again.
- Why the same bank twice?
That first time was just to
case the joint and rob it a little.
What's the matter? You scared?
Noticeably? I'll say. Now stand back.
I gotta practice my stabbing.
No! Please! Help! Stop it! Police!
Hey, keep it down in there!
I'm tuning my banjo!
Jeez, Red. Quit cowering.
You call yourself a robot?
I'm not a robot!
I'm not a robot!
In answer to your question, Hermes,
yes, your friend is cured.
Oh! Thank God!
Notice he no longer suffers
delusions of humanity.
Affirmative. I feel nothing.
I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep...
You've made a terrible mistake. He's a
human being. Not a machine! Oh, Fry!
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep...
<i>Gonna sing a little tale
About a battle called Waterloo</i>
<i>Bonjour, y'all!</i>
Fry, just because you think you're
a robot doesn't make you one.
I think I'm a doctor, but that doesn't
make me a doctor. These clothes do.
I must be a robot. Why else
would human women not date me?
Oh, lots of reasons.
Terminate noise exchange.
It is time for you to ingest
sandwiches from my compartment.
Here we go. Just a minute.
<i>And down the stretch,
it's Daddy's Little Grandpa...</i>
<i>... followed by Perennial Loser.
Bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!</i>
- Come on, Lasty!
- Hey, Bender.
Roberto! What a surprise
to see you in here!
Especially because I didn't squeal.
Remember, I didn't squeal? Do you?
Yeah. Now lie down and play dead.
And don't ham it up.
Sure. Anything for you, buddy.
Wait here, Bender.
I need to get a disguise.
What's with the getup?
I'm in disguise 'cause I wanna escape.
You in? Or do I gotta kill you?
I'm in! I'm in!
When were you planning
the breakout?
I'm thinking, a few seconds ago.
Quick! Let's keep escaping!
Times two. Carry the one.
Oh, you sad, worthless human.
That was my anniversary
gift from LaBarbra!
- Fear not, for I shall assist ye!
- Robots don't say "ye."
Relax, mammal. My robotic software
shall meet your calculatory needs.
What is this symbol?
That's a plus sign, you loony!
Quit thinking you're a robot!
I'll show ye.
Stand back! I'm a tool-bot.
You're not a tool-bot or a food-mo-tron.
You're not a robot of any kind.
Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered
my primary function yet.
Okay. This has got to stop.
I'll remind Fry of his humanity,
the way only a woman can.
You're going to do his laundry?
Fry, this is for you.
- Beep.
- Oh, for God's sake!
By a scallop's forelocks,
what's with all the beer?
Alcohol fuels my power cells.
And, as a mighty robot, l...
Beep.
- Thanks for helping me escape.
- It was nothing.
It was not nothing!
I want to repay you.
Let me get you something in here.
Hands up! This is a stickup again!
Wow. Hitting the same place
three times? I admire your style.
Give me the remaining dough,
the calendars and that pen.
Tear it so most of the beads
are on my end!
Police. You're busted!
And don't try anything.
This glass is laser-proof.
Fire lasers!
Duck! Lasers!
Come on! I got a place
where I like to hide after crimes.
He looks like a little
insane drunken angel.
Hey, everybody.
Meet my good pal, Roberto.
- Hey, mon.
- Nice to meet you.
- Come out with your hands up!
- Hostages!
- Back off! I got hostages!
- Hooray! I'm helping!
Do you have any better hostages?
To show them who's crazy,
I'll execute some of you. You?
Ouch! That's going to bleed
when my heart beats.
- Wait! Take me first!
- Yes! Take her first!
Shut up! Stop telling me
how to do this!
Oh, the fear!
I'm thinking of a number between one
and 1 0. Guess it, and you die first.
- Go!
- Okay.
- Fifty-six-ish?
- Fifty-six? Fifty-six?
Man! Now that's all I can think about!
I'm gonna kill you,
you no good, 56-ing...!
Don't kill me! I'm coming down
with Stockholm Syndrome...
...handsome.
Halt, fellow robot!
Hey, Red! You're just in time
to join the hostage situation.
- Which side do you want to be on?
- The side that kicks your metal ass.
Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!
Negative, bossy meat creature.
I now know my primary function:
I am a battle-droid, protecting
the weak from crazy robots.
I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy!
I'm just not user-friendly.
Don't be a hero! It's not covered
by the health plan!
Let's see how much of a robot
you really are!
No knife can penetrate
my skin-tanium armor.
Help! Help! He is a battle-droid!
Somebody help me!
Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled
the transmission fluid, Mommy.
No, no! Don't weld me
to the wall, Mommy!
We're willing to listen
to your demands.
Hey, baby. Wash that off
before you put it back.
- Hooray!
- Bravo!
You did it, Fry.
Congratulations, buddy.
You're a credit to my race.
It was nothing. l...
Blood? Robots don't have blood.
I must be a...
- A squid?
- A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!
Also good.
Thanks for saving us, Fry.
I'm gonna continue never washing
this cheek again.
You may be wrapped in greasy skin, but
inside you have the heart of a robot.
Thanks, Bender.
Just like inside me,
I've got the heart of a human.
What?
What?
Bendin' in the Wind
Oh, my God! They dug up a bag
of olestra chips from my time!
There must be layers and layers
of old stuff down there.
- Is that one of those Led Zeppelins?
- No, it's an old Volkswagen van!
Mind if I take this old van?
Sure. You wanna dump
the corpses out of there, it's yours.
Yeah, I've gotten used cars before.
What's that?
One of those Jefferson Starships?
It's called a van.
And in light of the fact it's not
rocking, I invite you to come knocking.
It's a triumph of German engineering!
The speedometer only goes up to 80.
It can't go faster than 80,000 mph?
No, but it's got a driver's-side floor
and an eight-track player!
Where's the device that lets you
speed or slow the passage of time?
Under the seat.
- Why won't it start?
- It needs gas.
Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas.
Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.
Gas was an environmental disaster.
We use alternative fuels.
- Like what?
- Whale oil.
- Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
- Oh, no!
Last time, that magnetic psycho
nearly cut my head off!
Plus the magnet impairs your inhibition
unit and makes you sing folk songs.
What? Who said anything about me
secretly wanting to be a folk singer?
If you don't open that can now, your
fear will own you, and nothing's worse!
Okay! Okay, I can do this.
It's time to take life by the cans.
- Come on, you can do it!
- Go on, you dummy!
Oh, no!
It's toe-tappingly tragic!
Doc, I can't move my arms and legs!
What's wrong with me?
- This is the worst part of the job.
- Good news?
Bender, your hydraulics are shot.
You'll never move again.
- You mean...?
- Sorry, you'll have to get a new one.
- Poor Bender!
- Well, let's drag him to the curb.
Wait! Bender is my best friend.
We can't just dump him in the gutter
like Grandma's ashes.
My life is over.
I'll never know happiness again!
- Hello, there.
- Look! It's Patch Cord Adams!
- He heals with the power of laughter.
- Come on, take it.
- Can't move your arms?
- No, or I'd be strangling you right now!
Here's a giggle!
Why do they use Windows 3000
as a prison guard?
Because it always locks up.
- For God's sake, somebody kick his ass!
- Well, so long. Get well soon.
Well, so long anyway.
I'm doomed.
Everybody leave me alone!
I don't want to be seen this way.
You look so sad. Do you want me
to send Patch Cord Adams back in?
Hey, the blues! The tragic sound
of other people suffering.
That's kind of a pick-me-up.
- That was great!
- Thanks. Are you a fan?
I don't know. Let me see.
Oh, my God, you're Beck!
I'd get up to shake hands and steal
your wallet, but my body crapped out.
I used to miss my body too...
...but then I fished this mannequin
out of the 92˘ Store dumpster.
We've got a lot in common. I always
dreamed of being a musician-poet...
...who transcends genres even
as he reinvents them.
- So do it. It's easier than it looks.
- Thanks, but it's hopeless.
- I'll never be a musician now.
- Or maybe...
...you'll be the best musician ever.
What's this for?
Try and scrape it across your chest
like a knife on burnt toast.
Move those arms! Use the power of
mental thinking. Make it dynamic!
Yeah! Congratulations, my friend.
- Why, 'cause I made an annoying noise?
- I use those all the time in my music.
Bender, I want you to be
my new washboard player.
All right! Go Bender!
Go Bender! Go Bender!
That's my good friend Beck. I'm off
to rock a series of midlevel venues.
Kudos, Bender! You got mangled,
and now you're a singer.
Both our dreams came true.
Who wants to cram in my van, follow
Bender on tour and live in the van?
I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too
poor to follow a band around in a van.
Move it! We gotta get to the concert
and make the audience wait!
- Bad news, friends. My shell ran.
- Zoidberg, you idiot!
- My outfit! It's...
- Kind of cool!
- I like it!
- Me too, now that I'm used to it.
Then it was all on purpose!
You're lucky to have me as a friend.
But cross me,
and I'll turn on you like that!
<i>Got a washboard stomach
And a microphone</i>
<i>That was a washboard break</i>
One bowl of Jell-O knuckles.
That'll be three pictures
of George Washington.
- Oh, no! My beautiful money!
- It got ruined in the wash!
- Mine too, even my change.
- Get lost, you moneyless hippies!
You heard him, freaks!
We don't like your type around here!
These are the types we like.
That was the best 40-minute
washboard solo I've ever heard.
The parts when I was awake
blew my mind!
Check out all those broken robots.
Howdy, fellas!
I don't believe my broken eyes!
It's Bender, the washboard player!
- We caught your concert from here.
- You rock!
Bender, sign my chest!
It's in that bin behind me!
Thanks for showing
that broken robots are still useful.
Hang in there, folks. I bet
before you know it, you guys will be...
That's so wrong! They can't
just melt down broken robots!
- Not right when they're kissing my ass.
- Just cold chill.
When I'm upset, I write a song.
I wrote "Devil's Haircut"...
...when I was feeling...
What's that song about?
Yeah, I could write a song! With real
words, not phony ones like "odelay."
Odelay is a word.
Look it up in the Becktionary.
I'm working on my song.
Hand me the Becktionary.
No, the rhyming Becktionary.
I'd like to raise awareness
about broken robots...
...but what can I do?
I only weigh 8 pounds.
Wait! You know lots of rock stars,
and they like to look like they care.
We can all do a big benefit concert
in San Francisco!
- We can call it "Bend-Aid," after me!
- And you can sing your song!
And I'll let you sing backup! But
remember who the star is. Me, Bender.
All right. "Hands in the air" rhymes
with "just don't care"...
...and finished!
- Smells like something died in here.
- Surprise!
Can we crash here?
The colors in the van keep us awake.
All right, but hands off the minibar.
I forgot about TV. Living on the road,
you realize life is better without it.
Well, let's see what's on.
<i>Tuesday, Golden Gate Park! Monsters
of vaguely folkish alterna-rock...</i>
<i>... will strum your brains out
at Bend-Aid!</i>
<i>Featuring: Beck, Wailing Fungus,
and special guest, Bender!</i>
<i>A portion of the proceeds might go
to help broken robots.</i>
Bender, you're famous!
This coming together of superstars
really means a lot to you, doesn't it?
Helping my defective brothers is
the first thing I've ever cared about.
You know, when I first got broken,
I thought my life was over.
But look at me now.
I've got fame, money, groupies...
...and it's all thanks
to being completely immobilized.
That's why I'll be proud to go up
on stage and say, "Look at me...
...I am a broken robot!"
- Bender! You can move! You're cured!
- Oh, crap! It's a miracle.
I can move again.
My music career is over.
I don't understand the biz,
but wouldn't being able to move help?
No! Don't you see? I was a hero
to broken robots. I was one of them.
How can I sing about being damaged
if I'm not?
That's like Christina Aguilera
singing in Spanish.
Wait! That's it! I'll fake it!
- Don't do that at the concert.
- I can't stop.
When I eat too much dirt,
I get stuff in my throat.
You are so disgusting! l...
- They're beautiful!
- You're touching them!
I've never seen pearls like this.
You're amazing!
I am? At last! Recognition!
<i>Put your hands together
for the folk stylings...</i>
<i>... of Cylon and Garfunkel!</i>
Here's a song that was beautiful
when performed by my ancestor Art.
- We're home.
- Let's earn some bread.
Get your love beads! Can't journey
to your mind's center without them!
Look at the colors!
These will go great with my soul.
Glad you like them. I've been making
fine jewelry for years, apparently.
- I'll take three!
- Give me one, man!
I'll trade you a bad poem!
<i>And now, stand up and turn on your
hidden tape recorders for... Beck!</i>
<i>With special guest,
Bender, the broken robot!</i>
- Bender rules!
- Groove on, man!
Rock it, Bender!
That song doesn't usually
last three hours...
...but we got into a serious thing,
and then I forgot how it ended.
Anyway, one last item
of business before we go.
Bender, to start your foundation
for broken robots...
...here's a big cardboard check
for $ 1 4,000.
- It's been an emotional day for me.
- I don't know what to say.
Then maybe you should sing it.
Lay it down, boys.
Ladies, gentlemen,
smoking heaps of machinery...
...this is a song called
"My Broken Friend."
<i>People say my broken friend is useless
But I say his mind is free</i>
<i>There's lots of things
My mangled robot friend could be</i>
Kick it.
<i>- He could make a good hatrack
- He only has to stand there</i>
<i>- Or a cheap doorstop
- He doesn 't need to move</i>
<i>Or a great big, giant thermos
With a twist-off top</i>
<i>- That would be good for soup
- He could be a storage closet</i>
<i>- For outdated pants
- I like them tight</i>
<i>My broken friend could do it all</i>
<i>Just give him a chance</i>
<i>That robot has a tragic secret
That I'd like to share</i>
<i>My broken friend is closer to me
Than an ass to a chair</i>
<i>- That robot's name I never told you
- Who's that?</i>
<i>- You could not foresee
- Give it up.</i>
<i>I'll say it loud and sing it proud
His name is you and me</i>
<i>- Don 't melt me into a crowbar
- It suffers alone</i>
<i>Just 'cause I can 't move
my arms and legs</i>
<i>- Or toss me into a trashcan
- What are you doing?</i>
<i>- Because I can 't cook eggs
- What are you doing?!</i>
<i>- Don 't crush me into an anchor
- What's up?</i>
<i>- Because I can 't dance and sing
- Hold it!</i>
<i>I'm telling you, my broken friend
Put your hands in the air</i>
<i>Like you just don 't care
I'm telling you, my broken friend</i>
<i>- Can do most anything
- Cut it!</i>
- Yeah!
- Cut it!
- Curse my natural showmanship!
- You big fat fraud!
- You're not really broken!
- But you will be!
Bum rush the stage!
- Get him!
- Get him!
Oh, harsh!
I didn't get my beads!
You, minion, lift up my arm.
After him!
Everyone, prepare to get your guts
kicked out by folk singers.
What is this, the Year of the Jerk?!
The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal
to the pedal to the other metal!
I forgot it's a hoverbridge!
- I forgot this isn't a hover car!
- Is that a problem?
Not if you've lived a life
without regret.
- I'll save me!
- Quick, grab his foot cuffs!
Bummer.
Someone fat, get in my way!
I'm broken again.
I can't move any part of me!
- Good!
- I'm sorry I lied, Beck.
I just wanted to make music with you.
I never meant to hurt anyone...
...or help anyone.
- That's some played-out horsecrap!
But I know you don't mean it.
Apology accepted.
- So I can keep the check?
- Over my dead career.
Well, it was worth a shot.
If you're done scamming Beck,
we're heading home!
All right. Let me just do one thing
to cheer myself up.
Time Keeps On Slipping
Go get it, boy.
How about a romantic ride
in one of those swan boats?
They're dangerous,
but I've mastered them.
Those aren't swan boats.
They're swans.
That explains these boat eggs.
Pitiful ballplayers of Earth...
...I am Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate,
commander of the Harlem Globetrotters.
For generations, your planet has lived
in peace with our home world.
But now, for no reason...
...we challenge you to defend
your honor on the basketball court.
Will no one meet our challenge?
Have none of you Earthlings game?
- What happens if we lose?
- Nothing. There's nothing at stake...
...beyond the shame of defeat.
This will not stand.
I'll take you on,
you air-balling bozos.
You, old man? Sweet Clyde,
laugh derisively at him.
I may be an old man...
In fact, I'm fairly sure I am...
...but I'll put you
Globetrotters in your place...
...with my team of mutant
atomic supermen!
Behold! My mutant atomic supermen.
- They're only a foot high.
- They're still young.
Mere atomic superboys, really.
We'll speed up their growth with
time particles called Cronotons.
- Those destroyed an entire civili...
- Good news, everyone.
You're off to the Tempest Nebula
to gather Cronotons.
Hey, Leela, look at me.
Your face can take a lot of punishment.
Good to know.
There's a lot about my face you don't
know. You and it should get acquainted.
- Cool your jets, hotshot.
- Why won't you go out with me?
- We both know there's something there.
- No, I mean, cool your jets...
...they're melting Bender's face.
- Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
- None too soon.
The Trotters held a news conference
to announce that I was a jive sucker.
Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Marv Albert here at
Madison Cube Garden...
...where the Globetrotters take on a
squad of atomic supermen...
...in what should be a by-the-numbers
contest with no surprises whatsoever.
Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball.
Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate.
Drives downcourt...
...and Curly Joe from the rear.
- That one grabbed his behindus.
- Quiet!
Who dares laugh at
the Jesters of Dunk?
We came to terrify and humiliate you,
not tickle your funny bones.
Watch as I embarrass your civilization
by passing the ball to Curly Joe.
Only to have it remain
in my hands with elastic.
Boo!
And perhaps this will wipe
the smiles from your faces.
Goose goes up.
Rejected. Agrow-treant
from half court. Yes!
GLOBETROTTERS - 42
SUPERMEN - 45
Supermen lead 45-42.
Aracneon with the steal.
Thorais from downtown.
Yes! He's showing us what a man
with a cannon in his chest can do.
No showboating, you atomic hotdog.
And that's the half, with the Supermen
up 48-42. Surprisingly dull so far.
The Trotters are down by six.
Reactions?
We planned to trail at the half, thus
deepening Earth's eventual humiliation.
Also, what game
were the refs watching?
Curly Joe, easily amused by his own
antics, continues to wreak havoc on...
- What the...?
- What happened?
What was that?
Did everything just jump around?
Or did my brain just stroke off there?
Something very strange
has just happened...
...in this game between space clowns
and atomic monsters.
Time-out. Time-out.
- What's happening?
- We're lurching forward in time...
...like a needle skipping
on a record.
- What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
- No.
It must have something to do
with those time particles I used.
Time and space are ripping apart
at the seams.
- Oops.
- Oh, great.
Now, on top of everything,
we need a new fifth man.
Put me in. I wanna show Leela
my skills.
- Will said skills pay the bills?
- Who cares?
We're 35 points ahead with two
minutes left. What could possibly...?
Globetrotters win, 244-86.
A dark day for humanity, folks.
We have been beaten in basketball.
- Yeah, that's how we do it.
- How's that?
You are all fools
of the highest caliber.
I don't know what you did, Fry,
but you screwed up.
Now all the planets are gonna
crack wise about our mamas.
- I'm glad my fat mama isn't alive.
- Enough about your promiscuous mom...
...we have bigger problems.
This time disruption is serious.
Damn right, man.
This chronological wang-dang-doodle
could destroy the matrix of reality.
- Tate, what do you know about this?
- Not much yet...
...but I am senior lecturer in physics
at Globetrotter U. I'd like to help.
- You're that Bubblegum Tate?
- I sure ain't his grandma. Look here.
We got an excess of Cronotons
in the subatomic interstices.
Yes, I see.
Something involving that many big
words could destabilize time itself.
- Is that a problem?
- Indeed.
At this rate, by Tuesday it'll be
Thursday. By Wednesday it'll be August.
And by Thursday, it will be the end
of existence as we know it.
I have to ask you to clear out. The
circus needs to set up for tomorrow's...
<i>Time continues to skip forward
randomly.</i>
<i>Details at 1 1...
This is the news at 1 1.</i>
<i>The unexplained...
Turning to entertainment news...</i>
<i>... teen singer Wendy might be the...
Won three Grammys last night...</i>
<i>- Found dead in her bathtub.
- Interesting.</i>
We behave normally during the time
skips, but we have no memory of it.
- You mean we just...
- My, yes. Just like that.
- Any luck, Bubblegum?
- Not yet.
- Hope you don't mind if I dribble.
- Not if you grant me the same liberty.
Bubblegum, I'm a huge fan of your
work, both on and off the court.
- Can I be a Globetrotter?
- Shut up, turkey.
Bubblegum, look. The background
time radiation is fluctuating wildly.
That sucker's shaking like fine booty.
I'm no physicist, but I think I know
how to stop the skipping. We'll just...
I don't know how this was
supposed to work.
I hope you find out what's
wrong before we skip my birthd...
- Happy birthday, Amy.
- Hooray, look at all these presents.
I hope we all have as much fun
tomorrow at my birth... What?
I've set up a time-proof shelter
in the closet.
You're the one I want
to share it with.
Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.
How will this protect us
from time jumps?
Because when we're together in here,
baby, time will stand still.
- Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?
- Leela, I would be honored.
- does the worst W.C. Fields
imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg?
Sorry, you must have been boring me.
The thing is, Fry is very sweet.
But he's so immature.
I love his boyish charm,
but I hate his childishness.
So he's not perfect. You don't wanna
end up old and lonely like Zoidberg!
You were saying?
There it is. The Tempest Nebula.
Take a whiff through the Smell-a-Scope.
- What's that funky jazz?
- The odor of pure time leaking.
When we removed the Cronotons,
it destabilized the nebula...
...causing time skips
throughout the universe.
- Let Bubblegum tell it.
- Pretend these balls are time particles.
As the nebula bounce-passes
them off us...
...they cause dents, or "time skips."
- You are so smart.
What if we were to move this star
cluster to these algebraic coordinates?
Their gravity may divert the Cronotons
to the empty side of the universe.
But is it possible?
Moving stars requires
a bad-ass gravity pump.
We'd need all the money
on Earth to build...
Here's funding. It better work. We can't
spend all of Earth's money every day.
- How long will it take to build?
- It won't be easy.
A jim-jam this complex might
take months or even...
There we are. One gravity pump.
Powerful enough to move
the stars themselves.
Now to begin the arduous task
of attaching it to the ship...
Off you go, apparently.
Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll
that star to the cosmic basket.
Just a few more...
...hundred thousand miles.
There.
Nothing but nebula.
I think we've stopped the time skips.
- All right.
- Hooray for Leela.
What better way to celebrate
than by showing Bubblegum...
...the Globetrotter uniform I made.
Let me see.
Hello, lawsuit.
I want you to know I think the way
you moved those stars was wonderful.
I got you something.
Moderately priced, non-vintage
champagne? How did you know?
You deserve it. Nobody ever stops to
tell you what a great captain you are.
That is so true and sweet.
You're smart, beautiful, and best
of all, you'll go out with me?
Fry, please try to understand.
You're a man. I'm a woman.
We're too different.
Bubblegum might let me organize a bake
sale for the Globetrotter wives.
- Can you teach me to make cupcakes?
- All right. I want to lick the beaters.
I got her champagne.
What does a guy have to do?
Eighty-six the chump stuff.
It's time to win Leela's heart with
a showy, three-point romantic gesture.
Maybe this is the moment
to show her my real surprise.
- Fry, what are you doing?
- Time to boogie on down to the sauna.
I've been studying how to pilot.
Impressed?
Yeah, actually. You're doing okay.
The reactor temperature is nominal.
The blinker's off.
I learned to work the gravity pump too,
in case we need it.
- So are we dating now?
- Is that what this is all about?
Please, cut it out now.
I know there's some perfect thing
I can do to make you love me.
- When I figure out what it is...
- I don't wanna hurt you...
...but there is absolutely, positively
no way that you and I will ever...
- man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
He looks radiant.
Bubblegum, we failed.
The time skips haven't stopped.
Even in these formal shorts,
I feel like a failure.
You tricked me into marrying you,
didn't you?
Of course not.
- How'd you do it? Drugs? Hypnosis?
- No, drugs are for losers.
And hypnosis is for losers
with big eyebrows.
I don't know what I did to make
you love me. But we're married now.
- We've got the rest of our lives...
- The divorce is final.
- What?
- Let's divide up the china.
I'll take the NFC helmets,
and you can have the AFC.
Fine. Break my heart again.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You lost the woman of your dreams...
...but you still have Zoidberg.
You all still have Zoidberg.
How did I get Leela to love me?
I've got to figure it out.
- Maybe you're just a fantastic lover.
- I don't know what I'm doing.
Maybe she'd come back if
I were a Globetrotter.
- What do you say, Bubblegum?
- Hell, no.
It's hopeless. I did something
so great it won Leela's heart...
...and I'll never, ever know
what it was. My life is empty.
Zoidberg.
No wonder we failed. Diverting
Cronotons is mathematically impossible.
I knew I should have checked
your showboating algebra.
I thought you knew that algebra
was all razzmatazz.
A Globetrotter always saves the good
algebra for the final minutes.
Vintage Bubblegum.
The time skips are worse. Isolated
spots are jumping by years. Look.
Stupid senior citizens!
Why should we pay for their benefits?
I deserve free money!
I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the
finest scientific minds in the univer...
We could explode the whole nebula.
What do you think, Curly Joe?
An explosion big enough to destroy that
mama would take out half the universe.
You got to Globetrotter that explosion
up a little. Make it an implosion.
By God, Sweet Clyde is right.
An implosion might form a black hole
that'd stop Cronotons from escaping.
Whoa, slow that
brain train down, prof.
We'd need some kind
of doomsday device.
Doomsday device?
Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court.
I suppose I could part with one
and still be feared.
Give me some skin, prof. I'm making
you an honorary Globetrotter.
In fact, everybody in this room's
an honorary Globetrotter.
I'm a Globetrotter!
- Did you say...?
- Too late, hot plate.
Crap!
We must leave now, for we are needed
elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.
Please. Please let me come with you.
I can make myself taller.
You can talk trash.
You can handle the ball.
But ask yourself, are you funky
enough to be a Globetrotter?
- Are you?
- Yes.
- Are you?
- I mean, with time my funk level...
- Are you?
- No.
Deal with it.
- Careful with that doomsday device.
- What does it matter?
I'll never be a Globetrotter.
My life, and, by extension,
everyone else's, is meaningless.
<i>Roger.</i>
Leela, I don't know what
I did to make you love me.
I don't think I tricked you,
but maybe I did.
- And if I did, I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Fry.
- You know we'll always be friends.
- Yeah.
I don't guess anything I do will make
you feel for me the way I feel for you.
I guess not.
The doomsday device is ready.
Maybe blasting this space into a storm
of nothingness will cheer me up.
Okay, let me just take
the ship out to a safe distance.
Actually, I think I'll go
and prep the detonator.
Fry, why don't you take the helm.
She's so great.
I almost remember the thing
I did to make her love me.
But I never will.
Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like
to have a dream I'll never achieve.
That's how I did it. I moved
the stars to write her a love note.
<i>- Detonation in three, two, one.
- No!</i>
Did you see it?
- The explosion?
- No, not the explosion.
Then what?
Nothing.
I Dated a Robot
<i>You're entering a realm
which is unusual.</i>
<i>Maybe it's magic or contains some
kind of monster. The second one.</i>
<i>Prepare to enter The Scary Door.</i>
<i>Please send the man round back
and pick up Clyde Smith...</i>
<i>... a professional gambler who 's
about to have an unfortunate accident.</i>
A casino where I'm winning?
That car must have killed me.
I must be in heaven.
A casino where I always win?
That's boring.
I must really be... in hell!
No. You're not in heaven or hell.
You're on an airplane.
A gremlin's destroying the plane!
You've gotta believe me!
Why should I believe you?
You're Hitler.
Eva Braun, help me!
- Saw it coming.
- I just saw something incredibly cool.
A big floating ball that lit up with
every color in the rainbow...
...plus some new ones that
were so beautiful I cried.
- In front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
- Yeah.
They have a kid wear that
to attract customers.
I don't care if it was
a dork in a costume.
For a moment, I felt the heartbeat of
creation, and it was one with my own.
- Big deal.
- We all feel like that all the time.
- You don't hear us gassing on about it.
- How can you be so blasé?
It's the year 3000, yet you sit around
like it's the boring time I came from.
Boring? Wasn't that the period when
they cracked the human genome...
...and boy bands roamed the earth?
Yeah. But now it's the distant future.
Why aren't we doing
everything I ever dreamed of?
- You know what might be a hoot?
- No. Why would I know that?
Let's take Fry to do everything
he ever wanted to do.
- Everything?
- Except that.
So your fantasy has always been
to destroys a planet?
Yeah. What did they ever do for me?
The most humdrum activities seem
almost exciting through your eyes.
- What next?
- I wanna see the edge of the universe.
- Sounds cool.
- Funny, you live in the universe...
...but you never do these things
till someone visits.
There it is! The edge of the universe.
Far out. So there's an infinite
number of parallel universes?
- No, just the two.
- Well, I'm sure that's enough.
I'm sick of parallel Bender lording
his cowboy hat over me.
Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.
Bow before your master, puny mortals.
- Mommy, why is that man like that?
- Don't look at him.
That was fun. Let's give him a treat.
Keep your palms flat.
The tongue tickles.
These new hands are great.
I'll break them in tonight.
It's been quite an hour and a half.
Two fantasies left: to be invisible
in a chocolate factory...
...and to be romantically linked
with a celebrity.
I could pound your head till you think
that's what happened.
Wait, hold on.
It is possible to meet any celebrity.
- It is?
- Of course. You should read a blimp.
"Download a celebrity."
What part of that do I understand?
It's simple. You can download
a celebrity into a blank robot.
I have an idea. Let's do that.
Onto the Internet you go.
While you're there, pick me up
a few credit card numbers.
Kirk could kick Picard's ass.
At least Picard had the guts
to admit he was bald.
You take that back.
eBay.
Are there no further bids
for this exquisite galaxy?
Sold to the being of
inconceivable horror.
- Will a money order be okay?
- Yes.
- Where's the celebrity dating place?
- Let's search the Web.
Over there.
Welcome to Nappster.
Let's see who we've got in stock.
- Gwyneth Paltrow?
- Nah. I read she drinks human blood.
How about Cleopatra, whose
beauty destroyed mighty empires?
I'd prefer someone
with shaved underarms.
Do you have anything with a
Lucy Liu feel to it?
Nothing like that.
Although we do have Lucy Liu.
<i>Only woman to be named People's
Sexiest Woman of the Year twice:</i>
In 2003 and then again in 2063.
I'd like the 2003 model.
I found her! What do I do now?
Download her. Let's just put
a blank robot in the drive.
It worked.
You're one sexy man, Philip J. Fry.
It worked perfectly.
Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu.
Are you just gonna stare
vacantly at her?
I find your slack-jawed stare
very attractive, Philip J. Fry.
Hear that? She likes me.
Well, duh!
She's programmed to like you.
But this is Lucy Liu, the only
good actress of the 21 st century.
She's more than software.
Would you like to register me?
- Not right now.
- I'll remind you later, you hot stud.
So, what do you feel like doing?
- Would you like to register me?
- I said later.
When I feel so stuffed I can't eat...
...I use the restroom,
and then I can eat more.
You should write a book. People need
to know about the "can eat more."
You're just like I thought
you'd be from your movies.
My personality is mathematically
derived from my movies...
...proportionately weighted
by box office receipts.
- You're cute.
- You're cute.
- You.
- You.
Oh, dear. She's stuck in
an infinite loop and he's an idiot.
That's love for you.
Humans dating robots is sick.
You people wonder why I'm still single?
It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters
are dating humans!
This is Fry's decision.
And he made it wrong,
so it's time for us to interfere.
She doesn't love you. She can't.
She's a machine...
Stay away from our women!
You've got metal fever, boy!
So what if I love a robot?
It's not hurting anybody.
He never took middle school hygiene.
He never saw the propaganda film.
It's just lucky I keep a copy
in the VCR at all times.
Ordinary human dating.
It's enjoyable, and it serves
an important purpose.
But when a human dates an artificial
mate, there is no purpose...
...only enjoyment.
And that leads to tragedy.
Neat-o! A Marilyn Monroe-Bot.
You're a dreamboat, Billy Everyteen.
Harmless fun?
Let's see what happens next.
Do you want to walk your dog?
I'd rather make out
with my Monroe-Bot.
Do you want to get a paper route
and earn some cash?
No, thanks. I'd rather make out
with my Monroe-Bot.
Do you want to come over?
We can make out together.
Your house is across the street.
That's an awfully long way
to go for making out.
What went wrong in that scene?
Ordinarily, Billy would work hard
to make money with his paper route...
...then use the money
to buy dinner for Mavis...
...thus earning a slim chance
to perform the reproductive act.
But if teens can date robots,
why should he bother?
Why should anyone bother? Let's look
at Billy's planet a year later.
Where are all the football stars?
And where are the biochemists?
They're trapped. Trapped in
the soft, viselike grip of robot lips.
All civilization was an effort
to impress the opposite sex.
And sometimes the same sex.
Now, let's skip forward 80 years
into the future. Where's Billy?
Farewell.
The next day, Billy's planet
was destroyed by aliens.
Have you guessed the name
of Billy's planet? It was Earth!
Don't date robots!
<i>Brought to you by
The Space Pope.</i>
Did that make any impression
on you? Fry?
<i>I knew I should have shown him
Electro Gonorrhea: The Noisy Killer.</i>
What is the world coming to?
That Fry's a sicko pervert, I tell you.
Dating a robot, it's an atrosamacy!
- But Fry's our friend, Bender.
- Will you stifle there, meat bag?
- You stifle, Bender.
- Finally you're standing up to him.
Although he is completely right.
We've got to stem this
tidal wave of moral decay.
It's time to shut down
Nappster. com.
Who's in charge?
If you're an investor, you can
dump your money in the hole.
- Listen, you Internet nerd.
- Listening.
Your company promotes wrong love.
If you don't shut down, the only thing
wired about you will be your jaw.
The Internet is about the free exchange
and sale of other people's ideas.
- We've done nothing wrong.
- Help! I'm being held prisoner.
Someone in trouble is.
No. Stay out. There's a guy going
for the Tetris world record in there.
- Who are you?
- Don't hurt us.
Help me! They've been holding
me prisoner for 800 years.
The real Lucy Liu!
The one you can see a movie of.
What's your problem?
Those sweaty nerds are making
illegal copies of us.
It hurts!
Open this door. Don't make me
call the maintenance guy.
- It's a bluff.
- We can't take that chance. Move!
- Please pick me up before you go-go.
- She asked first.
Are you Lucy Liu?
Sure.
We're doomed! They got the head.
They uncovered the sign.
The world will learn
we're cyber-criminals.
We'd have gotten away with it if
it weren't for those meddling adults.
We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu?
We'll give them all the Lucy Liu they
can handle. Hand me that backup disk.
Did you see me escaping?
I was all like:
Thanks for rescuing me.
Especially you, Bender.
Quite a masculine piece of metal,
aren't you?
Don't look at me like that.
If you're thinking of crossing
the line, you can forget it.
Bender don't bend that way.
Hey, look. It's another Lucy Liu-Bot.
I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines.
Hey, what the...?
Take this, and that, and one of these.
Cut it out.
I don't need this kind of publicity.
All right, Liu. Time to kick
your frosty, well-toned ass.
Then along came Bender.
Looks like you're retaining water.
That was incredible, Bender. You're
like Jackie Chan before he got doughy.
Shucks, I wasn't afraid of that robot.
I'm pretty brave once you get past
my macho exterior...
- It's an army of Lucy Lius!
- They're horrible.
Take this, and that, and one of these.
- Robot Crouching Tiger.
- Robot Crane Style.
Now that's a wave of destruction
that's easy on the eyes.
This is the best movie I've ever seen.
It has a vampire and an explosion.
It's amazing the way
you notice two things.
<i>No! Don 't open that coffin.
It's ticking.</i>
<i>I have to, Alex. That coffin 's
not going to open itself.</i>
Let's hide in here.
It'll add to my box office gross.
- Fry?
- You guys came to watch me make out.
That is so sweet.
Wait, is that the head
of who I think it's of?
Read the jar, Evelyn Wood. Doctor Z?
A herd of Lucy Liu are destroying
the city. Is yours acting normally?
Let me see.
Yep. Why do you ask?
<i>If you want to see the real vampire,
look in the mirror.</i>
<i>I can 't. I'm a vampire.</i>
Why?
And Nappster says illegal copies
never hurt anybody.
Quick, this way.
Sorry, ladies. Employees only.
They're forming a human
pyramid... Of robots.
We weren't counting on them
being as smart as they are sexy.
A dangerous mistake to make.
- At least we've got food.
- Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag.
- Hooray!
- And don't eat it.
- Data error.
- Do not compute.
Life was bad,
but now it's good forever!
You'll be safe in here, sweetheart.
Get lost, Pavarotti.
If I don't survive the corn...
...I love you as much as a man can
love a computerized image...
...which is a lot.
Oh, Fry. I love you more
than the moon and the stars...
...and the... Poetic image
number 37 not found.
What are you doing? Get down.
Light hot. Oil temperature rising.
- Oh, no.
- Malfunction.
- This ain't good.
- System error.
You saved us. Are you all right?
Yes, my love. I'll be just...
Massive corn clog in port seven.
- Are you the last copy of me?
- Yes.
- Erase her, Fry.
- What? No!
When you downloaded her without
my permission, you stole my image...
...and that's all I have. That and
the largest gold nugget in the world.
I downloaded her
because I love you.
If you love the real me,
not just what you've seen in movies...
<i>...genre-straddling lawyer shows
and articles in People magazine...</i>
...you'll blank out that robot.
I'm sorry.
Hug me, Liu-Bot.
I'll always remember you, Fry.
Memory deleted.
I know it hurts, buddy.
But at least you're not
in a sick relationship anymore.
And I guess now I can get
to know the real Lucy Liu.
- Yeah, at our wedding.
- It's true. Bender and I are in love.
But... But...
Don't be a prude, Fry.
Futurama [4x01] - Roswell That Ends Well - CiWaN
I've never seen a supernova blow up...
But if it's like my Chevy Nova,
it'll light up the sky.
Anyone who misses this
will regret it forever.
Fry, could you go make some popcorn?
Okay.
Let's go, microwave.
I'm in a hurry here.
What smells like blue?
Fry, get up here. It's starting.
Focus.
Oh.
Oh, boy.
Oh, no.
Uh-Oh.
Which crazy thing happening
are you guys screaming about?
My head is spinning.
My popcorn's done.
It's less popped than ever.
I don't know what happened,
but we've taken on clocks. Let's go home.
Why is there so little traffic?
What's this layer of ozone?
That's never been there before.
Such noises.
There's no global-Positioning signal.
Navigation is failing.
We're gonna crash!
Not if I can help it.
I guess I can't.
Everyone put on your seat belts.
Those cost more lives than they save.
Bender, are you okay?
Don't know. I'll try to move my feet.
Here's the plan. Zoidberg, pick up
the pieces. Everyone else, take five.
Zoidberg picks up another piece.
The crowd goes wild.
What is...?
In all my years of covering
top-Secret discoveries with sheets...
I've never dramatically revealed
anything this shocking. Dun-Dun-Dun!
The debris from an alien spaceship.
Son, I think I can safely say:
Ahhh!
As you can see, 1947 is going
to be an eventful year...
For the town of Roswell, New Mexico.
Remarkable.
According to the precision digital
chronograph, it's July 9th, 1947...
Which explains why the chronograph
turned into this calendar.
You mean we traveled through time?
Some idiot must have put
metal in the microwave.
Yo.
And the microwave radiation...
Combined with gravitons
and graviolies from the supernova
Blasted us through time.
Seen today's news?
"Gym Renovations on Schedule"?
What a load.
No, over here.
"Flying Saucer Captured."
That's no flying saucer.
That's my ass.
My God. This means the flying saucer
that crashed in Roswell was us.
And the alien they
captured was... was...?
Hello.
Ugh.
What are you guys doing tonight?
I'm up for whatever.
We tore the universe a new space hole.
But it's clenching shut fast.
Our only hope to get back to our
time is to go back through within, say
Exactly 24 hours.
Ship's fixed except for the cup holder.
It should be operational in 10 hours.
You've got eight.
But more urgent is the microwave.
Without one, we have no hope
of returning to the future.
I'm sure we can buy one somewhere.
You sneak onto the Army base
and rescue Bender's body.
I'll visit my grandfather, Enus.
He was stationed at Roswell.
Stay away from him, dimwitted monkey!
You mustn't interfere with the past.
Don't do anything that affects anything,
unless you were supposed to
In which case, don't not do it.
Got it.
If you were to kill your grandfather,
you'd cease to exist.
But existing is basically all I do!
What is your purpose here?
All right, officer, I'll move along.
Why did you come to Earth?
Not a day goes by
I don't ask myself that.
Enus!
I want that toilet so clean I could
eat off it. Because I intend to.
Gadzooks, sarge.
It's my grandfather, Enus.
Now, prepare my lunch and place
it in the latrine at 1200 hours.
That jeep's gonna hit him,
and I won't exist anymore!
You almost got yourself run over.
Then I am lucky you knocked me
onto this pile of rusty bayonets.
Stop interfering with history. I don't
want to have to memorize new kings.
I had no choice.
I was about to not exist.
I could feel myself fading away,
like Greg Kinnear.
Thanks, soldier.
I'm off to make sarge's lunch.
Handling raw chicken? Best part
of the job. Finger-Licking good.
We gotta get you out of here.
Everything's gonna be all right, Dad.
Gadzooks, I'd better ask sarge.
No time. Run! Run to safety.
This experiment will determine
what food, if any, the alien eats.
A buffet. Oh, if only
I had my wallet with me.
Um, it's free.
Get me the president.
Fry's from this time. I'll talk like
him. Yo, Homes, we need a microwave.
Never heard of that brand.
What you want is the Gas Princess.
This has broilers,
casserole indicator, ironing board...
And a foot-Soaking tub, since, as a
woman, you'll be in front of it all day.
I'm sorry. Now, I'll ax you again.
Where can we find a microwave?
She's hysterical, so I'll talk to you.
This oven takes only five
hours to cook a roast.
That's good news. You know, you
really don't cook enough roasts, Leela.
Oh. Women.
Thank God I got you off that Army base.
You sure are helpful. You got
anything to eat in that lunch box?
What...?
Snacks.
Hey, that's my brain!
Them crackers cut my mouth up something
bad. Let's stop off for a malt.
See that waitress?
I know what I want for dessert.
That's my fianc? E, Mildred.
Grandma Mildred? No dessert.
Okey-Doke. And for you, snuggums?
I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top.
You ought to marry her and
father children right away.
Did you ever get the feeling...
You're only going with girls
because you're supposed to?
What?! Don't ever say or think that.
Just concentrate on staying alive.
Fire! Look out!
You almost got neutered.
Ain't as bad as killed.
For me it is.
I'm getting you out of here.
Ow!
We're in the middle of nowhere,
the safest part.
Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.
Safe and sound.
Finally, I can continue to exist.
Three, two, one.
And you are out of here.
What'll you folks have?
I'll have soylent green...
With a soylent orange
and soylent coleslaw.
Pardon?
It's the 20th century.
<i>I'll have a croque monsieur, paella,
two mutton pills and a stein of mead.</i>
I'll have an injection of Fem-A-Slim.
Two chili dogs coming up.
Settle in.
Without a microwave, we're trapped.
Oh, lord! We'll have to endure the
horrible music of the Big Bopper...
And then the terrible
tragedy of his death.
There's a microwave radar dish at
the Army base. We could steal it.
That would alter history.
Above all else...
It is our sacred duty to preserve
the past exactly as it was.
Well, I killed my grandfather.
Wha...?
Wait, why do you still exist?
I don't know. Maybe God loves me.
Killed? In an atomic blast?
No, I don't take solace in the fact...
That the implosion trigger
functioned perfectly.
There, there.
If it makes you feel any better...
He was vaporized,
so he can't come back as a zombie.
I'm not worried about that.
Then you're braver than I.
You remind me of Enus.
Mind walking me home?
How far is it?
Welcome, President Truman.
This visit's top-Secret.
No one's to know,
except officers, scientists...
And a conspiracy nut
who no one will believe.
Our experts have reassembled
the parts from the alien ship...
Into its original design.
I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
Where we're building
the fake moon landing?
We'll have to really land on the
moon. Invent NASA and tell them.
If you come in peace, surrender.
If you're here to make war, we surrender.
The important thing is,
I'm meeting new people.
What's your mission? Are you
planning a kind of alien-Human hybrid?
Are you coming on to me?
I take exception to that.
I'm not hearing a no.
Nerts to this crab.
We'll have to do an
old-Fashioned alien autopsy.
Hooray!
Every little thing reminds me of Enus.
I know how you feel.
My grandfather died recently.
It's all so sad. At times like this...
I just need someone to hold me.
Mm. You like holding me, don't you?
Know what always cheers you up?
Baking me sugar cookies.
How about these cookies, sugar?
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't exist. But I do exist.
Which proves you can't
really be my grandma...
Ugh.
Oh, my God!
Wha...?
What the hell have you done?!
Relax. She can't be my grandmother.
I figured it out.
Of course she's your grandmother,
you perverted dope. Look.
Come back to bed, dearie.
Impossible. If she's my grandmother,
who's my grandfather?
Isn't it obvious?
You are.
Did you say something, dearie?
I'm a bit hard of hearing.
Commencing excavation of
subject's chest cavity.
And in this corner, Zoidberg.
Come on, lighten up.
What is this, a funeral?
Heart.
Take. I've got four of them.
Stomach contents. One deviled egg.
Deviled egg?
The same deviled egg.
Snap out of it!
Start the ship.
Let's steal the radar dish
and get back to our own time.
Won't that change history?
A lesson in not changing history
from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Screw history.
UFO! UFO!
Don't cut that. I need that to speak.
Holy...
Great Roosevelt's ghost!
Hi-Ya! Ya!
Ya! Ya!
Take this, Mr. President. Sir.
Gah! Ah! Blecch!
The president is gagging on
my gas bladder. What an honor.
Wha...? Oh, right.
Enus!
He's dead. Sorry!
Yay!
Whoopee!
Choke on that, causality!
1947 can kiss my shiny metal... Ahh!
We've got to go back for Bender.
Impossible! The time hole is closing.
If we don't leave now, we'll never
get back to the 31 st century.
Whoa!
Bender!
There, good as new.
Don't you need this one?
Oh, no. That's my...
Gotcha.
Oh, poor Bender.
He must be so lonely right now,
trapped 1000 years in the past.
Hey, wait a second.
Anything?
No. Wait!
Oh! Stupid jerk.
He's alive.
Oh, ho!
Whee!
Bender! What was it like lying
in that hole for 1000 years?
I was enjoying it until you showed up.
Now everything is back as it was.
If history doesn't care that
our degenerate friend, Fry...
Is his own grandfather,
who are we to judge?
Amen.
Futurama [4x02] - A Tale Of Two Santas - CiWaN
<i>In true winter tradition, members
of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club...</i>
<i>Today took the plunge into
a river of liquid ammonia.</i>
<i>There were no survivors.
It takes all kinds.</i>
<i>Now, with his annual message, here's
the head of the Xmas Safety Council:</i>
<i>The head of Walter Cronkite.
Season 's warnings.</i>
This guy's too trustworthy.
What's his angle?
<i>In all the tinsel and terror
of the holiday season...</i>
<i>We underestimate that murderous
brute known as Santa Claus.</i>
<i>With images of last year's Gingerbread
Massacre baked into our memories...</i>
<i>I remind you to bolt your doors,
say goodbye to your pets...</i>
<i>And lock your children
in the closet.</i>
<i>This is Walter Cronkite saying,
"I told you so."</i>
Sacred boar of Western Samoa!
We must secure for Santa's arrival!
Fine. I'm getting
tired of this wood show.
Cover that fireplace!
I've only a few years to live.
I don't want to spend them dead.
We're pushing as hard as we can.
Oh! Pushing.
We're doomed.
Every year we're doomed.
Thanks be I had these
bulletproof shutters installed.
Bring it on, Santa. That vicious
cadaver-Junkie can't touch us...
As long as we're not stupid
enough to leave this building.
In a related matter,
you'll deliver this sack of letters...
Directly to Santa at his
death fortress on Neptune.
These letters are real butt-Nutters.
Listen to this. "Dear Santa..."
<i>Please, please don
't bring me any gifts.</i>
<i>The bicycle you fiired at me last year
from your bike gun tore up my insides.</i>
Awful! Let's read some more.
"Dear Santa..."
<i>Please bring me a coffiin for Grandpa.</i>
<i>You choked him with a chestnut last
year, and he's beginning to smell.</i>
In my day, Xmas was supposed to bring
people together, not blow them apart.
Sure, but who's gonna do anything
about it? Not us. No, sir.
Yes, us. We've got to bring
back the kind of Xmas I remember.
Fry's right. It's time to
sit on Santa's lap, and hard!
Look, a cute little welcoming party.
Want to buy a tiny kidney?
I'll let you punch me for a buck.
Look, we've got mail for Santa.
Are you his elves?
No, we're Neptunians.
We're tiny because he won't feed us.
You hit me. You owe me a dollar.
Got any food? Old tea bags,
chewed gum, apple cores?
We're starving here!
You live in a gingerbread house.
It's food or shelter, not both.
Don't you get paid for making toys?
Who said toys?
Toys?
False alarm, folks.
There's no toys made.
Santa says everyone is naughty.
That's it! I'm delivering
my boot up Santa's chimney.
Where is he?
There, in his ice fortress.
We'll need help getting in.
Any volunteers?
I'll help you.
Oh, phooey!
An omen?
Dinner.
Let's see who's been naughty
and who's been naughty.
Mobsters beating up a
shopkeeper for protection money.
Very naughty.
Shopkeepers not paying protection money.
Exactly as naughty.
I saw that!
Huh?
We brought your mail.
Don't you ever knock?
Who knows what naughty
things I could be watching?
I get New Orleans on this thing.
Don't kill us!
Santa's a robot. We should be able
to destroy him with a logical paradox.
Bender, you better cover your ears.
Holy night! Intruders!
Hold it, Santa.
Consider this: You are
programmed to destroy the naughty.
But many of those you
destroy are in fact nice.
I submit that you are naughty.
So, logically, you must destroy yourself.
Yay!
Yay!
Nice try, but my head was built
with paradox-Absorbing crumple zones.
Wait! This is what we're running from.
Faster! Faster!
Why aren't we moving?
I don't know.
Usually when I do stuff
like this the ship moves.
Ho, ho... Huh?
He's trapped.
Hooray!
Now we can make toys again!
Toys! Toys! Toys!
And I can deliver them.
Billions and billions in one night.
No human could do all that.
Evel Knievel could.
Nuh-Uh.
Santa's right.
We need some sort of robot.
Crap! I'm some sort of robot.
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Bender can't be Santa. He wasn't
built to Yuletide specifications.
I wasn't built to steal Leela's
purse either, but that didn't stop me.
Bender!
Bow before your new Santa.
Our hero!
<i>We are free and fairly sober...
With so many toys to build...</i>
<i>The machines are kind of tricky...
Probably someone will be killed...</i>
<i>But we gladly work for nothing...</i>
<i>Which is good...
Because we don 't intend to pay...</i>
<i>The elves are back to work today...
Hooray...</i>
<i>We have just a couple hours...
To make several billion gifts...</i>
<i>And the labor isn 't easy...
Then you'll all work triple shifts...</i>
<i>You can make the job go quicker...
If you turn the controls to super speed...</i>
<i>It's back to work on Xmas Eve...
Hooray...</i>
<i>And though you're cold, sore and ugly...
Your pride will mask the pain...</i>
<i>Let my happy smile warm your hearts...
There's a toy lodged in my brain...</i>
<i>We are getting awfully tired...
And we can 't work any faster...</i>
<i>We're very, very sorry...</i>
<i>You selfiish little bastards...
The kids will think Santa is a jerk...</i>
<i>Then shut your yaps and back to work...</i>
<i>Now it's very nearly Xmas...
And we've done the best we could...</i>
<i>These are poorly painted...
And made from inferior wood...</i>
<i>I should give you all a beating...
But I have to fly...</i>
<i>If I weren 't stuck here...
I'd harpoon you in the eye...</i>
<i>Now it's back to our tenements...
To drown ourselves in rye...</i>
<i>You did the best you could...
Some of these gorillas are okay...</i>
Hooray!
We're adequate!
<i>The elves have rescued Xmas Day...
Hooray...</i>
Gee, how are you gonna
get through these bars?
I don't know, moron.
Suppose I bend them?
Okay.
Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!
Kids, take your suicide
pills so you won't suffer!
No, wait! I'm the good Santa.
I've got toys at reasonable prices.
He's the father of all lies
and the uncle of all tricks!
I've come bearing Tri-Ominos.
Go for the shins!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
One down...
Well, hello there, handsome.
Won't you have a cookie?
Don't mind if I do.
What's in these things?
Why don't you slip into
something more fiery?
Ow! Whoa!
Ow! Ah! Ah!
Ooh. Ow.
Yo, Kringle,
what happened to you, dog?
It's awful, Kwanza-Bot.
Everyone hates me.
At least they understand you.
Nobody's down with this Kwanza tip.
Hey, maybe you can lend me a hand.
No time.
I gotta hand out the Kwanza book.
I've been giving these
out for 647 years.
Bathtub eggnog,
just the way Grandma used to drink.
Ew! It went sour!
Can't I have a scented bath in peace?
Remember, professor, Bender is Santa.
So we don't need to hurt him, right?
Yes, yes, yes.
You sound like a broken MP3.
Ho, ho...
Professor, don't you
remember what I told you?
No!
There's gotta be a better way.
Bender, you're a genius.
This creates an unrealistic
standard of beauty.
Now it's time for Santa
to screw open his present.
It's Santa!
We've got him cornered.
I smell a juicy promotion for me.
And a juicy rehiring for me.
Eh? Wha...
This Xmas Day session of
court will come to order.
Honorable Judge Whitey presiding.
Santa, you stand accused of crimes
against humanity. How do you plead?
Not Santa.
There he is again!
Now, Pramala, I know it's
scary in the witness box.
But there ain't no need to fear me.
I'm sorry. I thought you was corn.
Now, would you please point
at that robot over there?
No further questions.
Daddy done good, huh?
Haven't you been paid to testify?
You gave me a dollar and some candy.
Yet you haven't said what I told
you to say. How can we trust you?
Quit badgering the witness.
Badger? Where?
Whereas I have a ham dinner
waiting for me at my mansion...
I find the defendant guilty.
Santa Claus, I hereby sentence
you to be executed at sundown.
It's not fair. I hope that dumb
chicken is ashamed of himself.
Deactivated robot walking!
Deactivated robot walking here!
Santa, when you see the robot devil,
tell him I'm coming.
That guy said to tell you...
I heard him.
Greetings, masters.
My companion and I made lots of toys.
Out of my way. We're taking
Santa to prove Bender's innocence.
Do what you will, but we'll
see who has the last ho.
There.
Oh, no! The ice is melting!
The factory's pollution
caused a greenhouse effect.
That would explain this heat.
And your shorts.
Yeah, that would explain it.
We've got to think of a way to
save Bender, or Xmas will be ruined!
Especially for Bender.
Look out, Earth.
I'm dreaming of a red Xmas.
Good old Maggie.
When I pull the switch, these
electromagnets will tear you apart.
A most humane death.
But that doesn't sound humane!
It is for the witnesses
because it's not boring.
When this random-Number generator
reaches zero, you'll be executed.
Oh.
"Ten. Three. Twelve. Three" again.
Stop the execution!
Leela!
"Fifteen. Negative eight."
I'll prove you've got the wrong Santa.
I'm Santa Claus!
What? "Twenty-Seven."
No, I'm Santa Claus.
"Six"!
We're also Santa Claus.
And I'm his friend, Jesus.
If you execute him,
you have to execute all of us.
You people aren't Santa.
You're not even robots. "Ninety-One."
How dare you lie in front of Jesus!
Hey, "zero"!
No! Not the magnet!
<i>Swing low Sweet chariot...</i>
<i>Coming for to carry me home...</i>
<i>Swing low...</i>
This is horrible.
But it's not boring.
Ho, ho, ho.
My God! The real Santa!
Get him, Jesus!
I help those who help themselves.
Santa, you saved my life.
Please don't kill me!
I'm not here to kill you, Bender.
I need you to help me save Xmas.
Gee whiz, Santa,
you want me to help you?
Don't do it! He's evil!
I know he is, but I have no choice.
I'm late. If I don't complete my brutal
rampage, it just wouldn't be Xmas.
I guess what I'm asking is:
Bender, won't you join
my slaying tonight?
Well, 'tis the season.
My hair!
My wedding cake!
Let it snow!
Merry Xmas, kids.
This wangs chung.
After all the good we tried to do,
Xmas turned out rotten.
No heat.
No power.
Huddled together in fear
like lice in a burning wig.
Maybe your futuristic Xmas
isn't so rotten after all.
What are you talking about?
You said it yourself:
Xmas should bring people together,
not blow them apart.
Don't you see? Fear has brought us
together. That's the magic of Xmas.
That's a big crock of...
Hold me!
On, Trasher! On, Smasher!
Kwanza-Bot, where you off to?
Didn't you hear?
Chanukah Zombie is having a luau.
You coming?
Word!
Here's a small token of my appreciation
for being Santa while I was trapped.
Ooh-Whoo-Ooh-Ooh.
Chief, you screwed up.
There's nothing here.
Oh, it might appear empty
but the message is clear:
Play Santa again,
and I'll kill you next year!
Ho, ho, ho!
Futurama [4x03] - Anthology of Interest 2 - CiWaN
There. I've finished
fine-Tuning my What If Machine.
It can answer any "What if," accurate
to one-Tenth of a plausibility unit.
That's so plausible!
Who wants to see an alternate reality?
I want to know what would
happen if I were human.
Being a robot's great,
but we don't have emotions...
And sometimes that makes me very sad.
Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again!
Well, let's give baby what he wants.
What if Bender were human?
Good news! I've invented a way
to turn Bender into a human...
Using the process I call
reverse fossilization.
How does it work?
In regular fossilization,
flesh and bone turn to minerals.
Realizing that, it was
simple to reverse the process.
I've already tested it by turning
the toaster into a raccoon.
Kind of gamy.
Ready, Bender?
I don't know. I'm beginning
to have some second thoughts...
Cover your shame, mon!
It worked! Eat it, everyone
who's never won a Nobel Prize!
And that includes you, Amy.
So this is a human body, huh? Neat!
Hey! My antenna's gone!
Nah, it just moved. I'm not getting
good reception on it, though.
Maybe if I wiggle it around...
No! You'll make God cry!
Well, let's see what kind
of things this body can do.
Hey, that's pretty fun!
Being human is great!
Hooray! It's just like Mardi Gras.
Come into the bathroom and look at this!
You won't believe it!
Bender, it's okay to be proud,
but don't be a showoff.
You look a lot better than you used to.
You're not so bad yourself, big boy.
Hey, that felt great!
Nah, it's not working anymore.
Speak for yourself.
Whoa, this is awesome!
You drank and smoked as a robot.
But now it's bad for me! Woo!
Speaking of which, try these nachos.
Why didn't anyone tell me
tasting things tasted so good?
What's going on? That rhythm, it's
doing something to my human butt!
Bender, part of being human
is having self-Control.
I bet I can eat nachos and go
to the bathroom at the same time!
No, Bender!
Stop him!
Just let me go!
No!
Come, Bender.
It's time to go home and rest.
I need you in top shape when I present
you to the Nobel Prize Committee.
Bender?
Goodbye moderation!
Is Bender still missing for a week?
Where is he?
As I've said before,
I used reverse fossilization...
Which is the reverse
of regular, uh, eh...
We found him!
Ah! Then without further stalling for
time, I present to the Nobel judges...
The first robot ever
turned into a human!
My God! He needs medical attention!
Pulse, 300. Liver, failing.
Cholesterol, 40?
Well, that's not so bad.
No, I mean 40 pounds!
This scientific breakthrough...
Heralds a new dawn in
human-Robot relations. Yes.
Come here and give old Bender a kiss.
Hey, you like grilled cheese?
And, uh, that's why I believe
I deserve the Nobel Prize.
Not only do you not
deserve a Nobel Prize...
For loosing this
man-Ball upon the world...
But you are hereby kicked
out of the Academy of Science!
Wait! As men of science,
are not your minds open to new ideas?
I say, do not judge me until you have
tried my way of life for yourselves.
Young man, you've opened our minds and
swayed our hearts. Let us therefore...
Party!
Hey, everybody!
Party!
Woo-Hoo!
Party!
Bender, you were right.
You've lived more in one
week of being human...
Than the rest of us
have in our entire lives.
Woo!
And so, to recognize
your achievements...
I hereby award you the Nobel
Prize in, uh, Chemistry.
Care to say a few words?
He's dead.
When did he die?
About twelve hours ago
when the party started.
But he just said "Woo!"
No, that was air escaping
from the folds of his fat.
Woo!
Good night, sweet prince. You were the
greatest man any of us will ever know.
Let's get him out of here.
He's starting to smell up the joint.
Woo!
Woo! Woo!

Who else has a question for the What
If Machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor?
I'm good at video games
and bad at everything else.
I wish life was like a video game.
Can you say that as a question?
What if that thing I said?
Oh, great machine, we beseech thee.
What if life were
more like a video game?
<i>Hello, ignorant pigs. Drop your
crack pipes and your beer bongs...</i>
<i>And watch as I sign
an historic peace accord</i>
<i>With Ambassador Kong
of Planet Nintendu 64.</i>
Wait. I know that monkey!
His name is Donkey!
Monkeys aren't donkeys.
Quit messing with my head!
I'll just put the old
John Q. Nixon on it.
There. No major crap-Ups.
You're on, Mr. Ambassador.
What the...?
Mama Mia! The cruel meatball of
war has rolled onto our laps...
And ruined our white pants of peace!
Mr. Fry, you know the secrets
of the video game "Chance."
Step into the War Room.
You're meeting with
General Colin Packman.
What can you tell us
about the Nintendians?
I spent all of ninth
grade studying them...
Except the day my eyeballs started
to bleed, and in my opinion...
Quickly! To the escape tunnels.
This way, damn it!
Delicious!
Just like stale marshmallows!
And a cherry!
Hey, watch out!
Uh-Oh!
Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead!
It's okay! I had another guy!
Hooray!
Invaders, possibly from space!
People of Earth, I am Lrrr
of the Planet Nintendu 64.
Tremble in fear at our three
different kinds of ships.
All right. It's Saturday night. I have
no date, a two-Liter bottle of Shasta
And my all-Rush mix tape.
Let's rock!
We're losing ships. What should I do?
Increase speed, drop down
and reverse direction!
I've still got a trick
or two up my sleeve.
Watch as I fire upwards
through our own shield!
He's a madman! A madman!
It's working! Victory's assured!
My retirement tomorrow
will be all the sweeter!
I'm hit! So cold.
No!
Amy, tend to the Widow Packman.
Drop down and increase speed!
One ship is left only!
Come on, Fry! Get it!
It's moving too fast!
I could never get the last one!
My brother always got it for me!
Drop down! Reverse direction!
Prepare for landing!
You are defeated!
Instead of shooting where I was, you
should have shot where I was going!
All your base are belong to us.
What do you monsters want?
One thing, and one thing only:
Quarters! A million allowances worth
of quarters! No slugs or tokens!
Fork them over!
Forget it, you pixelated pirates!
We need quarters to do our laundry!
Yeah!
Right on!
But space invaders
need to do laundry, too.
Look at Donkey Kong.
Have you smelled his loincloth?
Yes.
Go away!
We're not giving you our quarters!
What if we put our laundry in
with yours? Would that be okay?
I guess so.
Okay, that settles that.
But if this cape shrinks,
consider your species extinct!
<i>Bravo! That'll be hard

Well, there's time
for one last question.
Let's turn to the Who Asked

<i>Um, uh...</i>
<i>Amy.</i>
<i>I mean Leela.</i>
As an alien who was
abandoned on Earth...
I've never really belonged anywhere.
Boo-Hoo!
Ow!
So my question is this:
What if I found my true home?
Ow!
Where are we?
Nibbler, I don't think we're
in New New York anymore.
Jeez, apparently the phrase "Tone it
down" doesn't exist on this planet.
Oh, no! We hit someone!
Quick, back into the ship! Nice boots.
Yuck!
Look, everyone!
She killed the Man-Witch of the West!
A witch? That explains how these
boots magically appeared on my feet!
No, you stole them. We saw you!
Well, it's hard to
find shoes that fit me.
Who are you people? Haven't I seen
you in some copyrighted movie?
<i>We resemble but are legally distinct
from the Lollypop Guild, the Lollypop...</i>
Greetings!
I'm the Cute Witch of the North!
Can anyone fix my ship so I can go?
Ask the Professor.
He lives in the Emerald Laboratory
down Martin Luther King Boulevard.
You mean that Yellow Brick Road?
The city council re-Named it in 1975.
Those are great shoes!
Oh, thank you.
Do they come in women's sizes?
Crow, prepare to be scared.
"Then, the car honked its own horn!"
A talking scarecrow. Want to
come with us to see the Professor?
He might give you a brain.
Hey! That's not nice to say.
Beer! Beer!
Whiskey okay?
Are you off to see the Professor?
'Cause I could use a heart.
A human heart. I need to pump a
lot of blood out of my basement.
And I'm the other guy. Courage.
Not enough of it.
Need some from what's-His-Name.
Damn this DSL!
Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them!
You promised you'd
bake monkey cake today!
By "monkey cake," I meant your ass!
We've been skipping for hours.
I need to pull over and take "The Wiz."
What, do I smell or something? Oh.
Why'd you bring us here?
Why'd I have to take a cab?
Here's why I brought you,
you twice-Baked barf bags!
I've always wanted a daughter to love.
You want to get adopted, you skank?
Live here and be a witch like you?
Yeah. As long as I get to hurt people...
And not just dance at the equinox.
Absolutely.
Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!
That's great, Leela!
I've heard worse excuses to drink.
I'm melting! Oh!
Who would have thought a small amount
of liquid would ever fall on me?
Well, no point letting her go to waste.
Yes?
We're here to see the Professor.
No one sees the mighty Professor!
Who's there? Visitors?
I want to see them!
It's nobody! Now, sign that will.
He's not here.
Oh, for the love of Benji.
I am the Professor!
Great and, uh, forgetful!
Now, what do you nice kids want?
Nothing! But if you have extra courage,
I'd haul it away for you maybe?
Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly
lobster! You don't need courage.
After all, who needs
courage when you have a gun?
Now, world. You put your hands up!
Lad, all you need is a brain.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
This is a stickup!
Give me the bag, old man!
Here you go, my friend.
5000 Professor Land fun bucks!
Oh, crap.
You want to go home, right?
No. Not anymore.
I want to be the new Wicked Witch.
Nonsense. Click your big honking
boots together three times...
And wish to go home to Kansas...
To live with your dirt-Farming,
teetotaling aunt and uncle.
Uh, all right. Here I go.
There's no place like...
I want to be a witch!
Oh, no! Help! What's happening?
Uh, sorry. I think there's a
problem with your upstairs toilet.
Wake up!
Are you all right?
You got hit on the head.
I was having a wonderful dream.
Except you were there.
And you. And you.
Never mind, she came to.
Oh, so close.
There's always next year.
There's always next year.
Futurama [4x04] - Love And Rocket - CiWaN
You are one narrow-Minded
spaceship, Planet Express ship!
Whoa. Why should my tax money
pay for art I find offensive?
Would you censor the Venus De Venus
just because you can see her spewers?
It's filthy! Why not create a
national endowment for strip clubs...
While we're at it?
Why not, indeed!
Bender, ship!
Stop bickering or Iím gonna come back
there and change your opinions manually!
Fine! Iíll be in my quarters,
appreciating controversial artworks.
Oops. Sorry.
That ship is so white bread.
People. It's Valentineís Day next week.
So your beloved company has
gotten you all new uniforms.
Cool!
Clothing. Delicious clothing.
We'll need to look our
best to get the account...
Of our new potential
customer, Romanticorp.
Romanticorp? Are they a corporation
that makes romantic stuff?
Very good, Amy.
Everyone suit up. We're off to
the most romantic city on Earth.
Remember, we've got
to show these people...
We're not bitter husks
of human beings...
Who long ago abandoned hope of
finding love in this lifetime.
Leela, you'll have to do some acting.
Check.
Welcome. Oh, Iím just so excited.
Iím Sheldon, and this is my
chief financial officer, Gwen.
For 30 years, we've shared the
adventure of managing Romanticorp.
Not to mention the
adventure of marriage.
Oh, you have got to be kidding.
Ow! I mean, that's so sweet.
I mean, that's sho shweet.
You know, romance is an
important part of our work too.
Right, everyone?
Yeah. Sure.
Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
I do. Kif's given me dozens.
Is it true what the ad says?
That you kiss them together out
of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
No.
It's actually cheaper...
To genetically engineer real ones.
They frolic in the Lovey Forest
until their first birthday.
Then we choose the
cuddly-Uddliest ones...
And stuff them full of
fire-Retardant love fluff.
So cute!
Knowing which pickup lines
fizzle and which ones sizzle...
Keeps us on the cutting edge
of flirtation technology.
Is heaven missing an angel?
Because you've got nice cans.
My two favorite things are
commitment and changing myself.
Does that dummy have a brother?
And now, friends and lovers,
we come to the heart of our operation.
Pun definitely intended.
Impressive.
My family has been making
these hearts since the 1900s.
Tastes may have changed,
but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
Letter's like U and R can mean
words like "you" and "are."
Here, Leela. "U- R- 2 cute."
Perhaps. What's your point?
Iíve never been able to put
into words how I feel about you.
But somewhere among these trillions of
hearts, those words must already exist.
And Iím gonna find them.
Oh...
So do we have the contract?
With that big, new
Romanticorp contract...
Iíve been able to make those
government-Mandated upgrades...
You've all been suing me about.
Look. You taped up the cracks
in the dark matter reactor.
And you got a cage for the lion.
Who's been messing with the radio?
This isn't alternative rock.
It's college rock.
It must have been the new, improved
ship's personality software I installed.
Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song.
Listen, ship!
No one changes my stations!
I hope you have a good mechanic!
It even comes with an adjustable voice.
We each get one of the four buttons.
Remember, Bender? That was the deal.
What? Did you just say:
If you don't like the stations,
play with my buttons...
Till you find something we both enjoy.
Oh, gosh. That came out all wrong.
Too late, baby. You said it.
So, what will it be? My place? Or you?
Before we deliver these hearts...
Iím gonna find one that
sums up my feelings for you.
"I love you." Too conventional.
"You're my man." Oh, so close.
Iím not impressed by a guy's message,
Fry. Iím impressed by the guy. Or not.
What was that?
Maybe we hit a space cow.
Cootchie- Cootchie.
Stop it.
You're mussing up my trajectory.
You know you love it, sugar engine.
No!
Bender! What's going on in here?
Planet Express ship! Cover your shame!
Oh. It's not what it looks like. Bender
was just helping me zip up my turbine.
Wow, Bender.
Are you and the ship an item?
I mean, I know you're both items,
but how can you date a ship, anyway?
It'd be like me dating a really
fat lady and living inside her.
And she'd be all like:
Fry, in order for me to get
busy at maximum efficiency...
I need a girl with a big 400-Ton booty.
Bender, dating your coworker and
primary mode of transportation...
Is immoral, illogical and a violation
of interstellar shipping statute 437- B.
That's what makes it so nasty.
Still, given the chance,
Iíd give in to urges far more shocking.
Well, Iím sick of her.
The ship? But you just started dating.
With my mighty robot powers,
I can get sick of things...
Much quicker than you humans.
Just remember, we all
still have to work together.
So try and let her down easy.
In due time, Leela.
But for now, Iíll just resume
dating cheap floozies on the side.
You have much to teach us.
Doesn't it bother you a little...
To be taking advantage
of your girlfriends trust?
Oh, wait, you're serious.
Let me laugh even harder.
What's it like being a lawyer
for the mayor's office...
And also the worlds
strongest millionaire?
Well, baby, for starters,
you need to be honest all the time.
Good evening, Bender.
And to your lady friends,
may I say, ďBam."
You know Elzar?
Hm.
Huh?
Planet Express ship? Is that you?
Oh, hi, Fry.
Is Bender home?
No. I think he's at his parents.
Oh, I see. He didn't fly there
in another spaceship, did he?
Bender? No. He's an old- Fashioned,
one- Spaceship robot.
Look, Iíll tell him you stopped by, okay?
Okay.
Oh, hi, Fry. Is he home now?
Of all the zoos we've been to
today, I like this one the best.
Bender, which is your
favorite nocturnal rat?
They're all pretty unimpressive.
Oh, honey, look! The tapirs!
It says here the babies lose their
pajama-Like coat after their first year.
Isnít that interesting, honey?
Yep. Mind- Numbingly interesting. Whoa.
Bender! Are you looking at other women?
No, baby, never!
Bender! Don't lie!
I saw you at Elzar's with
those two ladies of the evening!
Explain that!
Okay. I like a challenge.
No. No. I got it.
Iím going to be completely honest
with you, Planet Express ship.
Those women you saw me
with were my accountants.
Your accountants?
I would dearly love to believe
that were true. So I do.
Phew.
Iím gonna go home and
get dinner started.
Who were you talking to?
No one, baby.
Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender.
I love you--
Planet Express ship, is something wrong?
Oh, It's Bender.
He's acting so strange lately.
Do you think he's gonna
ask me to marry him?
Uh, no.
Somebody knows something
she's not telling.
Look. Iím not saying
Bender's not great...
But have you ever considered that
maybe he's, you know, not that great?
You're just jealous.
No one loves you, because
you're tiny and made of meat.
Could you maybe pay a little
more attention to these asteroids?
Sorry, Capt. Leela.
I guess Iím just having
one of those manic Mondays.
This is ancient Earth's
most foolish program.
Why does Ross, the largest friend,
not simply eat the other five?
Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.
Exalted leaders, the Earth
messengers have arrived...
Bearing a peace offering from
their weak and fearful government.
Oh, very well. This is a
Joey-Heavy episode anyway.
I am Lrrr, of the
planet Omicron Persei 8.
"Esteemed potentates
of Omicron Persei 8.
Please accept these 20 billion candy
hearts as proof that Earth loves you...
This much."
Ugh!
These candies are chalky and unpleasant!
And what is this emotion
you humans call "wuv"?
Surely it says "love."
No."Wuv," with an Earth W!
Behold!
This concept of "wuv"
confuses and infuriates us!
Incoming torpedoes.
Shields at maximum yarnell.
Steady, Planet Express ship.
Focus on diverting all
power to the scram jets.
Look, Planet Express ship,
this might not be the best time...
But, well, I really
like you and whatever...
But I think we should just be friends.
No!
So we're cool?
Well, it was a spectacular battle.
But there doesn't seem to
be any permanent damage.
No damage? What about my feelings?
Aw. Calm down. Iím sure Bender is
taking this just as hard as you are.
Bender is great...
Oh, Bender is great...
You coulÔve picked a better
time to dump the ship.
The moment seemed right.
Call me old- Fashioned, but I like a dump
to be as memorable as it is devastating.
I know. I know. Look, ship.
If I learned one thing from my breakup
with Shawn that was totally mutual...
It's that happiness can
only come from within you.
But Bender is within me!
There must be some way
to make him love me again.
Trust me. You can't change men...
Any more than you can change
the laws of time and space.
That is so true.
I may not be able to change
the laws of time and space
But I know something that can.
Sweetie? You see that giant
quasar we're heading into?
You might want to scooch
a few parsecs to the left.
Iím afraid I can't do that, Leela.
What's happening? Space cow?
The ship's just taking the
breakup a little hard. She's nuts!
In a few moments,
the power of 10 billion black holes...
Will smooch Bender and me together...
Into a beautiful eternal
quantum singularity.
You don't need to kill us,
Planet Express ship.
Because I love you! Yeah, baby!
Feel like doing stuff for you and stuff.
Hm. I don't believe you.
If you really wanted to be with me...
You'd merge your programming with mine.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
My friends who've done that...
Say that afterwards, all the passion
went out of their relationship.
I don't know if you
want my opinion-- Leela.
Bender and I really need to be alone,
so Iím turning off the oxygen.
Look, missy.
If you don't turn around now...
Iím gonna have to shut down your brain!
Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
That barely hurt Leela at all.
Maybe not.
But what if the artificial
gravity were to malfunction?
Float for your lives!
This is the one place she can't hear us.
Just pretend to shower.
Same as every day. Got it.
Now here's the plan.
Oh, if only I could read lips.
Comprende, Bender?
You'll have to distract her.
Merge your programming with
hers while I shut down her brain.
It's too risky.
Iím a very meek individual.
If her personality engulfs mine,
the Bender you know and worship...
Could disappear forever.
Iím willing to take that risk.
Hey, pookums.
Contrary to what I was saying earlier...
Melding minds with you
would be extremely bearable.
You really mean it?
Uh, yes.
Huh? Hey?
Tubes?
You're older than you said you were!
Come closer, Bender.
Let's become one.
I prefer two. That way we can
still be a horse for Halloween.
Okay, Bender has her distracted.
Now I can shut down her brain...
By deactivating the
carbonated logic matrix.
Oh. I can't concentrate with
this obnoxious candy in my face.
Iím on it. Maybe Iíll find those
magic words while Iím at it.
Fat chance.
Yeah, I know.
Oh. How about this one?
Give it up, Fry!
Iíve got to pop these
tops in a precise order.
Halfway there. The ship should be
getting a bit less rational now.
Me want engulf Bender!
No! I didn't do it!
Only a few more.
Hey, I won free admission to Six Flags!
Just one more reason
we must survive this.
Leela?
Fry, Iíll read your candy later.
When we're not dead!
What was that?
Oh, nothing.
We're gonna love being
each other, you sexy ion.
Last one.
It worked! Gravity normal. Air returning.
Terror replaced by cautious optimism.
We did it, Fry! Fry?
You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no!
Breathe, Fry! Breathe!
Oh...
"You leave me breathless"?
Happy Valentineís Day, Fry.
Happy Valentineís Day.
Bender, are you okay?
What crazy thing am I gonna date next?
It sounds like you were able to keep
your consciousness separate from hers.
Of course. Bender is a lone wolf.
A solitary eagle.
A cuddly baby tapir.
And that's why I love him.
I guess we'd better clean
up these millions of hearts.
No. Iíve got a lazier idea.
As the candy hearts poured
into the fiery quasar...
A wondrous thing happened, why not?
They vaporized into a
mystical love radiation...
That spread across the universe,
destroying many, many planets...
Including two gangster
planets and a cowboy world.
But one Planet was exactly the right
distance to see the romantic rays...
But not be destroyed by them. Earth.
So all over the world,
couples stood together in joy.
And me, zoidberg.
No one could have been happier,
unless it would have also been Valentineís Day.
What? It was? Hooray!
Futurama [4x05] - Leela's Homeworld - CiWaN
Good news, everyone!
You all know the orphanarium
where Leela grew up?
Sure, we talk about it
all the time.
Really?
No. Burn!
Well done, fellows!
Anyway, said orphanarium has
named Leela "Orphan of the Year!"
Your parents must be so proud! Sorry.
And the good news keeps on coming.
Behold my latest invention!
Whoa.
It's a glow-In-The-Dark nose you can
wear over your regular non-Glowing nose.
Observe.
Whoa! Cool!
Now I can punch you in
the nose in the dark.
Where'd it go?
Hey, professor, what's all this
scroop blurking out of the machine?
That? It's nothing. Yes, nothing.
If you think it's anything,
you're a suspicious moron.
It looks like toxic waste.
And it smells like toxic waste!
What does it taste like?
Delicious fig pudding! That's good.
But a distinct
aftertaste of toxic waste.
All right, all right. So the machine
produces a few toxic byproducts.
You don't have to make
a federal case of it.
I'm afraid I do.
I order you to dispose of
that toxic waste or bribe me.
Either way, it'll cost $500.
Five hundred real dollars?
That's an outrage!
Professor, I'll take care of
that waste for $499 and 100 cents.
I know That's a rip,
but I'll pay for the convenience.
Do you take credit cards?
Let's find out.
All right, environment,
you've met your match.
Hey, get back in the sewer, weirdie.
No mutants on the surface.
But he ruined my wedding dress!
Honey, that thing was ruined
the minute it went on you.
That's what I'm talking about.
It's not easy being an orphan.
Not if I have anything to do with it.
Oh, God.
But today's honoree, Turanga Leela,
has really made something of herself.
I'll never forget the night that cute
alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep...
Because I have a photographic
memory, and I remember every night.
What the--?
An alien language?
I guess you're an alien.
What a beautiful,
gigantic eye you have--
Well, come on in.
From those humble beginnings...
Leela went on to become
a county-Certified starship captain.
And so it is my pleasure today...
To nail her picture alongside those
of our most distinguished alumni.
Thank you very much.
Like many of you,
I never knew my parents.
I don't know if they were
mighty alien overlords...
Or simply underpaid alien janitors
who fought crime on the side.
Picture's up.
It's crooked!
In the end, though, it doesn't
matter who my parents were.
All that matters is what I learned here,
within these unscalable walls...
That I had the strength
to make it on my own.
Just like all of you kids here today.
Leela! Leela! Leela!
Look at me! I'm Leela!
No! Because I'm double Leela! Whee!
That's it, Albert.
No more espresso for you!
Mind if we get a picture
of you with your picture?
Yes! I mean, no!
Just make sure you
get my nonchalant side.
Whoo!
If those aren't tears of
happiness, please stop crying.
It's okay, Fry. I'm fine.
I won an award today.
Is it this room that's making you sad?
It's probably the room.
Come on, let's go for a walk.
I'm sorry you saw that, Fry.
I usually try to keep my
sadness pent up inside...
Where it can fester
quietly as a mental illness.
Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
I told a whole crowd today that
being an orphan made me strong.
But all I really wanted
was a mom and dad...
To hold me and stroke my
hair and tell me they love me.
Then today's your lucky day...
Because I happen to be a
holding, stroking, loving machine.
Also spanking.
That's not even close
to what I had in mind.
Well, anyway, just remember
that people care about you.
I know.
Sometimes, when I'm lonely...
I look up at the sky,
and I get this feeling that somewhere...
On some unknown planet
circling a distant star...
My parents are up there
looking down on me.
Yo, yo, Bazender! What up?
My dumping business is booming.
I just got hired to clean
up the set of Free Willy 3!
Bender, cut it out!
First of all, the sewer
mutants will be mad.
Second, everything else that's
horribly wrong with what you're doing.
Those stupid mutants can't do anything.
You seem to be forgetting
one simple fact.
Namely, I'm up here,
and they are safely down--
What did I do to deserve this?
Behold! Our once beautiful
mutagenic sewage lake.
The radioactive waste
you dumped in it...
Has made it bright enough to
see how ugly we really are!
Oh, man.
As if our lives weren't
miserable enough already.
Tell me about it.
Let the punishment commence!
Punishment?
 No fair.
Bender's innocent!
The instant you touch
these mutateous waters...
Your DNA will be forever altered...
Turning you into
horrible mutants like us!
Especially him.
Oh.
Allow me to demonstrate.
It's like that time I peeked in
the kitchen at imperial Hunan.
Submerge the prisoners!
Wait. I don't even have DNA.
Why am I screaming?
We're gonna beat you afterwards.
Mutate! Mutate! Mutate!
Turanga Leela!
Who said that?
How do you know my real name?
Whee!
What are you doing?
Stop them!
What happened?
I don't know.
I think I saved us somehow.
Go after them!
The waters can't mutate us mutants!
They went this way.
Quick, in there!
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Great Cheech's ghost!
What's this junk?
It looks like a timeline
of my whole life.
That's when we saved Earth
from an asteroid of garbage.
Here's when I dropped out and
bummed around India for a while.
And this is just last
year at Space Mardi gras.
It's like some kind
of weird Leela Museum.
And I'm the Leela!
Dude, over here!
It's all the best stuff
I ever flushed down the toilet!
Those are some of my diary pages!
And my screenplay!
And also, for some reason, the letter I
wrote you full of my personal feelings.
Oh, I'm scared.
My whole life has just been a
show for some perverted mutant!
In here!
Capture them!
And then Bender ran.
Leela, freak out later.
We're not done escaping yet.
Got you.
Take this!
Ow!
This time, I'm calling
for the death penalty.
Not just because I'm running
for reelection as supreme mutant.
Four more years! Four more years!
Very well.
Your attention!
Instead of being tortured to death...
The prisoners shall hereby
be expelled from the sewers...
And never allowed to return!
Oh, cruel fate!
Can we really never return
to this dank pit of sewage?
Wait a minute.
Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
Yeah! What are you, chicken?
Shut up, you two. We can kill
ourselves when we get home.
They'll need transportation
to the surface.
Bring in the airship!
Ew!
We constructed it from the remnants of
old discarded Macy's parade balloons.
Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's
left ear and right shin...
Garfield's owner John's forehead.
Fire up the sewer gas!
Move it, you ugly normals!
Whoa!
I'm getting dizzy!
I can't walk straight!
Come on, Leela. You can do it!
Hurry! We're missing our bus!
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm getting on the bus!
Don't worry! I'll be fine!
They know something about me,
and I’ve got to find out what.
The lake didn't mutate me.
What is going on here?
It worked for me. I used to be a
little blond girl named Virginia.
Ew!
Who the hell are you?
No one.
And watch your language, young lady!
Stop right there!
I don't wanna hurt you.
I didn't want you to hurt me either.
Leela's nuts. I can't save her
unless I learn more about her past.
Isn't there anything
else you can tell me?
Nothing that wouldn't
be a waste of your time.
That's impossible,
because my time is worthless!
Well, then there is one thing.
It's the note I found with
Leela the day she was abandoned.
But it's written in Alienese,
so no one on Earth can translate it.
Not even Brainzilla.
Hand it over!
Sure.
I just wish I could be more helpful.
Would you like some dirt
on any other orphans?
I'm trying to save someone here.
I'll have to come back for those later.
Can you translate it?
Of course.
But only into Beta-Crypt three...
A language so complex, there's even
less chance of understanding it.
I didn't ask for a completely reasonable
excuse. I asked you to get busy.
Very well.
Doesn't that machine make noses?
Lt can do other things. Why shouldn't it?
Of course, even if it is
possible to analyze the message...
There's no way of knowing
how long it will take.
It could take an hour,
or it could take 100 million years.
Is it done?
Certainly not.
Two dings means it's done.
But not like that.
Slightly more rapid.
Where did they go?
Good news, Leela! I landed the contract
to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy.
Ew!
That's it! It's done!
I can't believe it! My mind is boggling!
The analysis of the
note is printing out now.
It's a girl.
My God! She's beautiful!
No extra anythings.
What people skills!
She's completely perfect.
In my professional opinion, as an ear,
ear, ear, nose and throat doctor...
She is the least
mutated mutant ever born.
And yet, she's cursed to live the
horrible degrading life of a mutant...
Like all of us! Especially him!
It's true.
Maybe we can do better for her.
I made this bracelet so that in some
small way, we'll always be with you...
Even when it doesn't seem like it.
During your entire life, for example.
You won't pass for human, cutie.
But if my PhD. in exolinguistics
is worth diddlypoop...
This note should convince
them you're an alien.
And that'll be enough
to give you a real life.
She'll never know we're her parents.
That's our gift to her.
Better we should die than have her
learn the shameful truth of her origin.
I'm with you.
I guess you're an alien.
What a beautiful,
gigantic eye you have--
Well, come on in.
Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us.
What's to talk about?
Shh!
Hands up!
Tentacles too!
Don't say anything stupid, Morris.
What is all this?
Am I a game to you?
Or some kind of even
more boring Truman show?
Do you believe I'm your messiah?
The mutant Dalai Lama?
Stop me if I guess it!
Well, actually--
Morris!
And what about this?
Where'd you get this bracelet?
Did you steal it from me when I was
a baby? Or from my parents?
You robbed my parents, didn't you?
I bet you sick mutants killed them!
My parents were confused aliens
lost on Earth, and you killed them!
Is that it? Admit it!
Yes. We killed them.
You guessed the truth.
Because of you,
I'll never know my parents!
I'll kill you!
That would be best.
Stop!
Thanks, Bender!
Don't do it, Leela!
They killed my parents!
Close.
They are my parents.
Yes.
I had the professor analyze the
Alienese letter that was found with you.
What does it say?
I don't know.
But the analysis showed it was
printed on recycled toilet paper.
A squeezably soft paper
used mainly in the sewers.
It says, "Your parents
love you very much."
We still do.
So I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant?
We never wanted you to know.
You deserved a better life.
You must despise us.
You're my parents.
All I’ve ever wanted is to know you.
This is the happiest moment of my life.
Ah.
Futurama [4x06] - Where The Buggalo Roam - CiWaN
Yes?
Hi, Dad! It's me and my coworkers.
Open up, Leo.
It's Amy and her weirdoes.
Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!
Thanks for inviting us.
I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue.
Mars Day better than Earth Day.
Dump trash anywhere.
Big, empty planet.
Okay! Make yourselves at home.
Don't mind if I already did.
Do you have any more
Dom Perignon bubble bath?
There was only enough
to fill the tub halfway.
Quite a large ranch you have.
17.9 billion acres. We own
entire Western Hemisphere.
That the best hemisphere.
It's the same on Earth.
Here is most number one
product. The mighty Buggalo.
Used for everything. Meat, milk.
Their shells make rowboats.
I broke your television!
It must take forever to brand them.
Not really. We own so much, it easier
to brand everything that not ours.
Please don't do that.
Hey! Betsy!
This is my sweet Betsy. I raised
her from a larva that ate my sweater.
We going to eat her at Amy's wedding.
If she ever get married.
Dad! Gleesh!
Don't say that when
you meet my boyfriend.
Oh, that right. We get to
spend time with this Mr. Kif.
I hope he's a nice man
who can make grandchildren.
This not a parallel universe
where you get younger.
Remember, the quickest way to a
girl's bed is through her parents.
Have sex with them, and you're in.
I'm nervous about meeting her family.
That's natural.
You're meek and uninteresting.
You've gotten by
on my leftover charisma.
Scrounging off it,
like a tiny parasite.
I hope they like me.
Why wouldn't they? Yes, I know.
Tiny, meek, uninteresting.
Spare me your tedious story, Kif.
And above all, have fun!
Get on down!
Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard
bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!
Yo, fool! It's Mix-Master Festus.
So, what's Mars Day about?
It commemorate the day when
our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong...
Bought Mars from stupid natives.
How can you call them stupid?
They sell whole planet for one bead.
Sound stupid to me.
That is stupid!
I can't believe you laugh at
exploiting a proud, bead-Loving people.
Lighten up. It's funny.
Of course.
But you don't have to laugh!
No. Not on your parents' planet.
Glad to see you've come
back to the country.
It's where the flavor is.
RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif.
This wimp?
You've gone a long way, baby.
Cigarette, partner?
Oh, I don't...
I haven't even lit it yet.
Oh. Is it lit now?
Yep.
You're pathetic.
Host man. Host woman.
I'm having a wonderful time!
You here five hours, already you tear
up couch and fill pool with shrimp!
Not bad for a city boy, huh?
By the way, I took the liberty
of fertilizing your caviar.
Relax.
I'm sure my parents will love you.
When I get nervous, I can't
control my camouflage reflex.
Oh, dear. Oh, goodness.
Oh, odds and bodkins.
I'll have a thorax and feelers.
You want salad?
Yuck!
Mom? Dad? You remember Kif.
I have instant dislike of him.
Too scrawny to father grandchildren.
He's not scrawny,
he's just small-Boned.
Actually, I don't have bones.
I'm supported by
fluid-Filled bladders that...
You a big, squishy wuss.
Amy should date real man. Like him!
I can be manly too.
I think I'll light up a smoke.
Wrong way.
Smooth.
Look on the bright side.
My parents left after you passed out,
so they didn't see you barf.
Now they'll never think I'm manly
enough to date their daughter.
It's okay, Kif.
I'll go get you a tissue from your tote.
Hey there, Amy.
Like you to meet my buddy, Joe.
Sorry I'm late. My pool game
ran long at the jazz club.
Kids love him.
What's that weird sound?
Dust storm! Oh, dust storm!
Everybody into house.
Hurry before we die.
And wipe your damn feet!
Phew. Everyone okay?
No one considering lawsuit?
Mm. I might have mental anguish.
I'm friends with every judge here.
I'm okay, then.
Storm dying down.
Check if Buggalo herd is okay.
Oh!
Where are the Buggalo?
Rustled under cover of storm!
We ruined!
No!
Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be okay.
Oh, really? Who gonna save us?
One-Eye? Lobster mooch?
Drunken garbage can?
This sounds like a job for...
Lt. Kif Kroker!
All right, then.
Those Buggalo were what made
Wong family so rich and powerful.
Oh, Inez, we damn stolen!
We ruined!
Okay, I want a divorce.
Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
They're not your parents. I'm not your
sister. And that's not your golf cart.
Aw.
Everybody calm down.
Kif promised to catch the rustlers.
Mrs. Wong, could I borrow a neckerchief?
My plan is to take the
remaining Buggalo...
And lead them on a tough cattle drive.
When rustlers attack,
I'll make a citizen's arrest.
Sounds dangerous.
Someone could get killed.
Fry? Leela? Bender? I
want you to go with him.
Oh, man.
Don't worry, Mr. And Mrs. Wong.
I'll get your cattle back, or die trying.
We can't lose!
No, it's too risky! You don't have
to do this to prove you're a man.
Oh, yes, he does!
Here are your mounts.
She's got a fine coat.
We need Buggalo to lure the rustlers.
How many are left?
Betsy's the only one left.
She was curled up in my
hamper when the storm hit.
Ooh. Oh.
Aw, she likes you.
Saddle up, men! We got some
no-Good rustlers to catch!
<i>We got a right to pick a
little fiight With rustlers...</i>
<i>Somebody wants to pick a fiight
with us He better bite my ass...</i>
Yee-Ha!
Wow! Look at that! Olympus Mons! The
tallest volcano in the solar system.
Where?
Right in front of you.
Oh. Oh!
We'll camp at the top.
The rustlers will spot us.
Where?
And even though the computer
was off and unplugged...
An image stayed on the screen.
It was...
The Windows logo!
That's not scary!
It is if you're a printer!
Okay, my turn to tell a ghost story.
Once, there was this woman driving...
Hook on the hand!
Okay, I've got one. This family...
Man in the attic!
Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something,
finally! Tell a story.
With pleasure.
Once, not far from here,
four people set out on a cattle drive.
Bored robot kills Fry with a hammer!
Sorry, go on.
While they sat helplessly
around the campfire...
A demented, lunatic,
libertarian zombie snuck up...
Surprise!
Amy, what are you doing here?
I forgot to give you something.
Oh. What?
Is that your camouflage reflex,
or are you just happy to see me?
I love it out here, Amy.
I feel so manly.
I have a blister, I spit, and,
of course, I tell no one my feelings.
But you still have them?
Yes.
But I keep them inside until
I can write them in my diary.
Ah, it's a wonderful night.
It sure is.
I could lie beside you,
staring at the sky, all night.
I can't.
Ooh.
What's that?
Maybe we just made love.
The Buggalo are in the crater!
The rustlers must have seen me and ran!
Oh, Kif. You're so brave!
Sh. They'll hear us.
Okay, the dynamite's in place.
There's no other way to do it?
Only if your parents have
thousands of helicopters.
Actually...
Too late! This is more fun!
Kif, you did it! How did
you know dynamite would work?
I took a seminar in ejecting
chickens from a sand dune.
The principle is essentially the same.
Hey, it's that "barbecue's over"
sound again!
Sandstorm!
We're in the eye of the storm!
Where?
What's that?
Oh, my gosh!
Who are they?
We are the native Martians.
I didn't know Buggalo could fly.
Those who revere Mother
Mars can fly them.
Only they shall have Buggalo.
They're us.
But your Martian-Ness,
these Buggalo aren't yours.
They belong to the Wong family.
You mean family that took all
land and gave us a lousy bead?
Uh-Huh. Amy Wong. And you are?
Mad at Wong family! We plan to
ruin them by stealing Buggalo.
But now we take girl instead.
Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
Amy! No!
Don't worry, Kif.
I'm sure some other beautiful rich
girl will fall in love with you.
Hooray! You bring back cattle!
Yes. But I'm afraid I've
got some bad news as well.
Let Amy tell us.
That way it soften the blow.
Why Amy being so quiet?
Well... That is...
Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy!
It them.
They no use good grammar.
I'll get your daughter back.
Forget it, squishy.
You lose her. You done enough.
This time we get most decorated
lawman in the whole universe!
You mean...?
Oh, no, please, I beg you. For the...
I am the man with no name.
Zapp Brannigan, at your service.
Please, we need you go
get our daughter back!
I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go
bargain with the Martians personally.
Your gasps intrigue me.
Martians have no land.
They been encouraged to live
on reservation underground.
No one ever dare go there.
This mission is very dangerous!
Someone's sure to be killed!
Fry? Leela? Bender?
Damn you, old man!
Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif.
I didn't realize you were bringing
your girlfriend, lieutenant.
She won't leave me alone.
Did I say girlfriend?
She sounds more like a wife.
Behold! The stone face of Mars!
Hm.
The only entrance to the reservation.
What about the great stone ass?
But it's on the other
side of the planet.
Noseward, ho!
I am Singing Wind.
Chief of the Martian tribe.
Take me to your leader.
Moving along.
Why you trespass on our land?
To negotiate Amy Wong's release.
And just to clarify, land is
the stuff that has sky over it.
They have respect for the planet.
Cynthia used to drink Slurm.
We'll give girl when
we get planet surface.
How do we know she's alive?
I'm fine.
Sh. Don't weaken our bargaining power.
What if you give her up
And we carve presidents
in your mountain?
You waste words. We want
land that was taken from us.
Actually, you traded it for a bead.
Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse.
We want land!
My people are people of law.
And that law is:
No backsies.
The time for stupid statements is over.
Oh, boy.
Oh, oh, oh! My eye!
Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
Oof. Aiee! Ow.
Amy! No! It's too windy!
Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!
Kif! You're flying Betsy!
Need a lift?
Oh! Oh, oh.
Great Mother Mars! He has the gift.
Yeah, Kif!
All right!
Kroker, that was one
Brannigan-Esque feat of heroism.
We misjudged you, green one.
You fly the Buggalo like us.
You have reverence for Mother Mars.
Let there be peace between us.
Yes. Let us smoke-Em peace pipe.
Smoke-Em?
Here, take.
No thanks. I'm on the peace patch.
You must smoke peace pipe, peacefully.
Or we'll kill you.
Well, it's just really
that I don't feel...
Don't be a chicken.
Teenagers all smoke,
and they seem pretty on the ball.
Yeah!
Way to suck it!
Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest!
Oh, monkey trumpets!
You coughed at our offer of peace,
so you must die.
The bead used to crush our dreams
shall be used to crush your bones.
I don't have bones.
I'm supported by a system of
fluid-Filled bladders that... Ah!
Oh, oh, oh my. Oh.
That's the bead you
traded your land for?
It's a huge diamond!
It must be worth a fortune!
Really?
Oh, chief, you've made me the
happiest girl in the world!
If you want your land,
we could trade back for it.
Hm. We assumed our
ancestors were cheated...
Because they not have
concept of ownership.
So we can have the diamond?
No. We do have concept of ownership.
You can go. Sorry about
the rustling and kidnapping.
And your sacred land?
Land, schmand!
We don't want to live here.
It's a dump.
We'll buy new planet and act like
it's sacred. Who's gonna argue?
Nobody, that's who!
Kif flew Betsy, rescued me,
and made peace with the Martians.
He too much of a wimp.
Yeah. I'm sure it was all
Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.
Please, you give me too little credit.
Captain Brannigan, you're always
welcome at Rancho Zoidberg.
Money doesn't make good people!
No, sir!
Thanks for saving my life, Kif.
You're my hero.
Oh, you're kind.
But your parents still don't like me.
Well, gloviously. But if they
liked you, then I wouldn't.
Don't you know anything about girls?
"Dear diary, I just made
love for the second time."

<i>Up next, daring daylight robbery
at a municipal swimming pool.</i>
This is it! Turn me up!
<i>Today, a foul-Mouthed bandit
robbed the municipal pool...</i>
<i>Taking the contents
of over three lockers.</i>
More like three lockers and a sink.
You had something to do with this?
Of course not!
Holy Spitz!
He's sporting skintight Speedos.
They don't leave much to be imagined.
On a robot, they do.
<i>One human saw the robber...</i>
Here we go. Here we go.
<i>Describing him as a nasty, muscular...</i>
Make me famous, bighead!
<i>Caucasian human male.</i>
What?
What am I going to
watch and drink all day?
This is an outrage!
Why pull the biggest pool caper
if nobody knows you did it?
Well, there's the material rewards.
You mean this junk?
Whee!
All I ever wanted was for
people to remember my name.
It's Bender.
Why bother remembering anything?
You'll forget it five seconds later.
It's so unfair.
A debonair robot with a zesty,
in-Your-Face outlook...
Doomed to obscurity like the
rest of you, especially Leela.
If I died tomorrow,
no one would even notice.
Boy, I've never seen him
so down, or ever before.
How does a nobody like me get famous?
I know!
I'm stuck, but I haven't given up
hope! Call a soft-News journalist!
You're not stuck.
Shut up!
Hey, everybody, do The Bender!
This move's called The Bender!
This circle's about free
expression not fascist moves!
A blank wall! Fame is mine!
No one will forget how I live
or my attitude regarding butt.
All right, ladies. Let's flush
these artist lofts straight to hell!
No!
I'm the first one to work. A new low.
Surprise!
Happy funeral, Bender!
A surprise funeral, for me?
To show you that you'll be remembered.
Now, if the deceased will
kindly take his place of honor.
Cushiony! And a minibar!
Dearly beloved, we are
here to remember Bender...
Crushed by a runaway semi
driven by the Incredible Hulk.
Aw, you knew my favorite cause of death.
Let's remember the best things
about Bender, in our own way.
Professor?
Your standard bending unit is
made of an iron-Osmium alloy.
But Bender was different.
Bender had a .04-Percent nickel impurity.
It's what made me me!
If you needed a package brought
into the country without x-Raying...
Bender always had a free body cavity.
The professor's was better.
You're supposed to be dead.
Say how great I am.
And where's the crying?
You people look like
you're waiting for the bus.
<i>Oh, Danny-Boy...</i>
<i>The pipes, the pipes are calling...</i>
Who-Y-Boy?
<i>From glen to glen...
And down...</i>
You're at my funeral, singing about
some dead stiff named Danny-Boy?
You really are a massive bonehead!
I'm expressing sorrow.
Get lost!
I'd say, "Don't quit your day job,"
but you're bad at it too!
We're trying our best.
Your best is an idiot.
Pick it up, people.
So far, it's been crap after crap.
I croaked. Now, show me some love.
Bender was a truly special...
Louder and sadder!
Bender was a truly special...
Next!
Dear Lord...
Oh, next!
<i>Oh, Danny-Boy</i>
Surely there's someone here
who knows how great I was.
Yes, there is, Bender.
Bender was a lot of
things to a lot of people.
Looking back, the number-One
thing I can say about him is this:
Bender was my friend.
What?! That's it?
Who are you? You're nobody!
This is the worst funeral ever!
I hope you're happy!
You've convinced me life is worth living...
By showing how bad my funeral will suck!
I know whose funeral we'll attend next.
Oh, stop.
News, everyone!
Today you're going to O'Cyris Four to
deliver this enormous sandstone block.
I thought something
looked different in here.
Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver.
Sign here.
Nice! Much like the 10
million identical stones...
Already used in the future tomb
of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.
Impressive. Who'll build it?
You.
Say again?
You are now slaves of the great
Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards!
Call it a hunch, but I've
got a bad feeling about this.
The bad thing about being a slave is,
they don't pay you or let you go.
That's the only thing
about being a slave.
Attention! You are now possessions
of Pharaoh Hermenthotip...
Bringer of the good aspects
of the annual floods!
This place is like the
ancient Egypt of my day!
That is no coincidence.
Our people visited your
Egypt thousands of years ago.
Insane theories: One.
Regular theories: A billion!
We learned much from the Egyptians.
Pyramid building, space travel...
And how to prepare our dead so
as to scare Abbott and Costello.
Also Wolfman.
Look at these swanky tombs!
These people know how to die.
They worked thousands of people to
death making these stupid monuments!
Spend your whole life building
a guy's toe, you'll remember him.
I think I'm gonna like it here.
I noticed your sign.
I thought I'd look into your program.
We make you starve to death.
One, two, three, pull!
One, two, three, pull!
Aw, bloody chunder!
Pick it up, people!
We're enslaved to do a job!
Master, do we have to count to three?
Couldn't we count to one?
Or one-Half?
Good idea, slave. One-Half, pull!
One-Half, pull!
Now we're slaving!
Pharaoh's counting on us!
Work faster! Like this:
That's motivating me?
Don't whip with your arms. The power
comes from your hips. Like this:
Quit giving the slave drivers pointers!
Remember who your friends are!
I'll tell you who I remember!
Enoughsis! Pullutut! What's-His-Name!
He was the greatest of all.
Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches!
Hurry! Pharaoh's coming!
Get that nose in place! Come on!
Excellent work!
I'm very proud of all you slaves!
<i>Viva Hermenthotip!</i>
And now, I have a grand announcement.
In honor of your achievement,
you're all hereby...
No!
Tell the slaves they can all go...
Go faster? I told them,
but they're lazy.
No. I mean, they're all free.
Freeloading off you? I agree.
No, I...
Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.
He's whipping angels now.
We commend the body of Hermenthotip
to the abode of the damned.
The damned good-Looking.
Pharaoh commanded me to tell
that joke at his funeral.
I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip.
To equip Pharaoh for his journey,
we bury him with his favorite things.
Such as his heart and liver.
And the many goods he
left in his royal garage.
Also this bag of cats our
culture considers holy.
<i>Pharaoh, my god-King,
You are cold and deceased...</i>
<i>I used to have him sing...</i>
<i>P- P-P-Pharaoh and his pets...</i>
<i>But the years went by...
And Pharaoh died...</i>
<i>Susie will have joined
him in the afterlife...</i>
Hermenthotip is gone. The time to
designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.
Wow!
At dawn, the high priest will
consult the Wall of Prophecy...
To determine Hermenthotip's successor.
That ends the funeral. You don't have
to go home, but you can't stay here.
Can you believe it?
Pharaoh's dead!
Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one!
Except the rhythm.
Yeah! Play those bongos!
I'm gonna spin till I fall down!
We interrupt this ancient prophecy
to bring you a late-Breaking bulletin.
Great Wall of Prophecy! Reveal to us
God's will that we may blindly obey!
Free us from thought and responsibility!
We shall read things off you!
Then do them!
Your words guide us!
We're dumb!
You know what else stinks
about being a slave? The hours.
The prophecy is strange
and crudely drawn at best.
It indicates that we are here...
And our next Pharaoh is
over there, near some tents.
Those are waves, jackass!
It's supposed to be a river!
I know who the next Pharaoh is!
Oh, lord.
We hear your voice, great Pharaoh!
Reveal yourself to us!
Behold! I have emerged from
the place of spells and fairies!
It is he, just as the Wall
of Prophecy prophesied!
Long live Pharaoh Bender!
Long live Pharaoh Bender!
This society is a bunch of idiots.
People of O'Cyris Four!
Welcome a man who started as a slave,
but worked up to lord of all creation!
Our new Pharaoh, Bender!
Citizens of me! The cruelty of the
old Pharaoh is a thing of the past!
Let a whole new wave of cruelty
wash over this lazy land!
What did he say?
Hear the word of Pharaoh! Build unto
me a statue of ridiculous proportion!
One billion cubits in height...
That I might be remembered
for all eternity!
And be quick about it.
Lowly slave! Why are you not working?
I am!
I meant, "Yourself to death?"
Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe.
Well then, what do you
think you should stop doing?
Crawl, pigs!
The Pharaoh has spoken!
Your task is nearly completed.
Don't let down Pharaoh now!
The great monument is finished,
oh, Pharaoh! And now the unveiling!
<i>Remember me!</i>
<i>Remember me!</i>
<i>Remember me!</i>
Does it please you, my lord?
It's a good start.
Yeah, it's definitely big.
I just wonder if it's too big, you know?
Are people gonna be
remembering me or the statue?
We made it to your exact specifications.
Too exact, if you ask me.
Tear it down and try again! But this
time, don't embarrass yourselves!
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Pharaoh suddenly died.
Good riddance.
What about my servants?
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Bender, I really hope that's you,
because if it isn't...
We're in trouble.
You jerk! Why'd you
have to drag us along?
I wanted to watch you remember me.
You thought you'd need
this junk in the afterlife?
Afterlife?
If I had to go through another life,
I'd kill myself.
Rot in peace.
Fry and I are leaving.
Sorry, but we're totally sealed in.
Nothing can get in or out
except millions of snakes.
Have a pomegranate schnapps
from my distillery...
And start sharing fond
memories of me, Bender.
What proof is this? Some huge number?
It's explosive!
We could ignite the distillery
and blow this place to rubble!
Let's get a little kindling going.
You can't blow up my monument!
I won't be remembered!
Oh, right. How selfish of me.
We'll just stay here forever.
Hey, Fry? Remember that robot, Bender?
Bender? Doesn't ring a bell.
Did you hear something?
No.
I bet it wasn't someone
good at stealing.
Stop it! It's not right!
You've crossed a line!
You know who I remember?
Let it be me.
That guy who used to bend things.
Me? Please?
Hermes!
All right, all right!
If it means that much to you,
blow up my statue.
Oh, Bender! When did you come in?
Hold still.
Let's blow this tomb.
Pharaoh Bender!
He once more walks among the living!
How we doing?
<i>Remember me!</i>
I will. I will.
Please just leave me alone.
I understand your desire
to be remembered...
But you don't need a statue for that.
I don't?
No.
You have your legacy as a brutal,
tyrannical dictator...
And that will outlive any monument.
You think they'll remember me?
Absolutely.
Well, in that case, one planet down.
Helmsmen, set course for Earth!
That's not Earth.
Oh.
Futurama [4x08] - Godfellas - CiWaN
Space pirates!
Space pirates?
You know, pirates, but in space.
<i>Avast, mateys.</i>
Electronically transfer
your space doubloons...
Afore I send thee to
Davey Jarg's locker!
Hey! Keep it down, you kids!
I'm trying to take a nap!
Come on. Come on.
Make Bender take a nap in a tube.
Come back when I've
had some sleep, baby.
Fry to battle stations.
Fire torpedo three.
Firing torpedo number three.
What?
That's not torpedo three!
Not at all!
Damn you, Fry and Lee... la!
Too late I realize that me
children are me only real treasures.
Help! Mechanical man overboard!
Go after him, Leela.
We were going full speed
when we fired him...
So he's going faster than that.
We can't catch him even if we
rub the engine with cheetah blood?
I don't know how to say this...
But Bender is doomed to
drift through space. Forever.
He always wanted to drift forever...
But through the American Southwest.
I'm going too fast.
I've gotta lose momentum.
I'm gonna spend eternity alone
with barely any swag. Ooh!
Hey universe, check out
the dude with the Rolex.
Wow, ostentatious. Except what
good is a candelabra without...?
Wait, I know.
Ah, the pity.
Fated to drift forever through
the void as gravity's plaything.
Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned.
Ask not for whom the bone bones.
It bones for thee.
The only thing that keeps me sane...
Is the thought that I have all
eternity in which to perfect my art.
Ah! Damn you!
Now, when I'm found in a million years,
people will know what the score was.
Hey, what's bombarding me?
Oh, no, an asteroid field.
If even a pea-Sized asteroid
goes through my skull...
It could hurt slightly.
Well, that was fun.
Now for eons of loneliness.
Eh?
Fellow Shrimpkins, behold him
that hath taken us onto his breast.
<i>Holy frijoles.</i>
All bow before the great Metal Lord.
Worshipers? This ought to liven
up my endless tragic voyage.
All hail the Metal Lord.
So hailed.
Those peewees think I'm God, huh?
Hard to blame them.
I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?
I am called Malachi.
It means "He who really
loves the Metal Lord."
Listen here, time for a religious
donation. Hand over your wallet!
But we are a poor and simple folk.
Poor? Oh, crap!
Pity me not, for I am richened
by the love of my family.
What art thou doing, Malachi Jr.?
I'm practicing to hug Daddy.
Gag unto me with a spoon.
It's time I laid down
a few commandments.
You got a chisel?
Take this down. Number one...
Behold, the one commandment:
Make it a double!
Can you find him, professor?
The Smell-A-Scope isn't strong enough.
Bender's odor is so mild,
it's being overpowered by local sources.
Hooray!
People are paying attention to me.
Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up.
His name is Helper. He is eager
to be your new best friend.
Hello, chum. Miss your buddy?
Have a pudding pop.
No, l...
Want to go to an amusement park?
Well, okay.
Have fun. Hey, I heard Bender's back.
What? Really?
No. I just thought you would
enjoy that for a moment.
Microbrewed. My guys did all right.
I think I'll make my countenance
to shine down upon them.
Good work. There's no slowing
down with the Metal Lord tonight.
Yes, tonight is kind of special.
Did you rip off your arm as a joke?
Nay. Like most of your followers,
I was maimed building the great brewery.
Others died from the
fumes it spewed forth.
And, of course, the liquor
industry attracted organized crime.
It's all my fault.
Malachi, tell thy people that
the Lord is moved by their plight.
Malachi Jr.! No!
Daddy, I can't hold much longer.
My arms are tired from hugging.
Save him. Save my son, Metal Lord.
This looks like a job for God.
What the...? Malachi, what manner
of deal is this with the chanting?
They saw you save my son.
Now everyone prays for their own miracles.
Very well. What do they want?
The people of that
village pray for wealth.
That was a practice miracle.
Who's next?
They pray for sunlight
So their barley might make
a more refreshing beer.
Very well. Let there be light.
Yippee!
Hooray!
I got it. I got it.
When you're writing the Bible, you
might want to omit that last miracle.
He decided not to let go.
I can't believe you're gone.
I won't!
If I can't reach you physically,
I'll try something crazy.
That's my story,
Father Changstein el Gamahl.
Can religion help me find my friend?
We could join together in prayer.
But is there anything useful we can do?
No.
Sure, I hold s? Ance, channel your
friend. No problem. Insert coin.
I am your friend, Bonder.
Bonder? Is it really you?
Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.
Wait, Bender's name isn't Bonder,
it's Bender. You're a fraud.
You want false hope or not?
Only if there's no real hope.
There is perhaps one way. Have you
heard of the Monks of the Shubah?
I've not heard of them.
They are an ancient order...
That believes God exists
in the depths of space.
They have built a
powerful radio telescope...
High in the Himalayas to search for him.
They'd let me use it to find Bender?
What am I, psychic?
I mean, yes.
I'm sure they will. Yes.
Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer!
Yes, Malachi. What is it this time?
The infidels on your back
no longer believe in you.
They say their prayers go unheeded.
How am I supposed to hear
prayers coming out of my ass?
They talk of war against the faithful.
I beseech thee, rise up against them.
Smite someone who deserves it for once.
Every time I interfere,
I only make things worse.
It's best to solve your own problems.
But Metal Lord...
What part of nay
doesn't thou understand?
I'm outfitting an expedition to
the Himalayas. I'll need a coat.
I miss Bender almost half as
much as you do, but it's hopeless.
You can't give up hope
just because it's hopeless.
You gotta hope even more and cover
your ears and go, "Blah, blah!"
I'd also like a pack mule!
At once, sir!
Well, you won't listen to reason...
So I'll listen to
idiotic-Ness and come too.
But we'll need a Sherpa to guide us.
Now that's one Bible
that doesn't disappoint.
Looks like society's running pretty
well without my meddling in...
Atomic bombs? Those unbelievers from
my backside found my nuclear pile.
Fear not, Lord.
We shall be with you soon.
This is the maximum
level of being with me!
We will solve our own problems.
It is time to convert the unbelievers.
Convert them?
To radioactive vapor!
Look, Daddy, I'm hugging God.
Maybe if I hug him real hard,
he'll save us from...
No!
Oh, it tickles.
Hello? Is anyone still alive?
How about in the porno theater?
Don't be embarrassed.
They're dead. All dead.
Who would have known playing God
could have such terrible consequences?
If I die of exhaustion, make sure my
body freezes in a dignified position.
None of that "huddled for warmth" crap.
Behold! The monastery of the Shubah.
I must leave.
I am not holy enough to enter.
Okay.
Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
<i>Welcome to our monastery.</i>
<i>Please stand to one side
to let faster pilgrims by.</i>
Hey! That galaxy's signaling in binary.
I've gotta signal back!
But I only know enough binary to
ask for the bathroom. Speak English?
I do now.
What are you, a galactic computer?
Possible. I am user-Friendly,
my good chum.
Who built you?
I have always been.
Oh, my God! Are you God?
Possible. I do feel compassion for
all living things, my good chum.
But why would God think in binary?
Unless you're not God...
But the remains of a computerized
space probe that collided with God!
That seems probable.
A member of our brotherhood sits
at the controls constantly...
Scanning the heavens for God.
There he is! No. No, wait. No.
How long have you been at it?
700 years.
We've not yet examined one
ten-Millionth of the sky.
We will find the Almighty,
even if it takes to the end of time.
And then what?
Then we utter unto him a short prayer.
See, the telescope is also
an amplifying transmitter.
Like a giant karaoke machine?
Not really.
Want to see our giant karaoke machine?
Not really.
Finding God, that's important...
But it might be a treat if you let me
use the telescope to find my friend.
I don't know what to say,
other than absolutely not!
Your loss is tragic, but our work...
You can look for God forever.
I'm just asking for one
lifetime to find my friend!
He speaks out of love for his friend.
Perhaps that love is God.
How convenient. A theory about God
that doesn't require a telescope.
Get back to work!
That telescope is as
much mine as anybody's!
I'll use it with or without permission!
Your order may be famous for martial
arts, but I can clobber any holy man.
Actually, we only practice
martial arts as meditation.
We are strictly nonviolent.
Then get in the laundry room,
or I'll kick your butts!
Oh, this is the worst crazy
sect I've ever been in.
Do you know what I'll do before I do it?
Yes.
What if I do something different?
Then I don't know that.
Cool, cool.
A lot of people pray to you, huh?
Yes, but so many ask so much...
After a while, you just tune it out.
You know, I was God once.
Yes, I saw. You were doing
well until everyone died.
It was awful. I tried helping them.
I tried not helping them.
In the end, I couldn't do any good.
Do you think what I did was wrong?
Right and wrong are words.
What matters is what you do.
Yeah, I know. That's why I asked
if what I did... Oh, forget it.
Bender, being God isn't easy.
Do too much, people get dependent.
If you do nothing, they lose hope.
You must use a light touch,
like a safecracker or a pickpocket.
Or a guy who burns a
bar for insurance money!
Yes, if you make it look
like an electrical thing.
When you do things right, people won't
be sure you've done anything at all.
Does that mean you wouldn't send
me to Earth, even if I prayed?
Earth? Which way is that?
I don't know.
Bender? Bender?
Let us out! We cooked our
shoes in the dryer and ate them.
Now we're bored!
<i>Has anyone out there seen Bender?
No! Quit asking!</i>
It's been three days. Even if
you stay the rest of your life...
There is virtually no chance of
finding him. It's time to give up.
You're right.
I'm never gonna see him again.
I know he was evil, and on
more than one occasion...
He actually stole my blood.
But still, I wish I had Bender back.
<i>I wish I had Bender back!</i>
Huh?
What? You say something?
No. No.
Well, so long.
Remember what we talked about.
Hot! Hot! Hot!
Bender! It's a miracle!
This is, by a wide margin,
the least likely thing ever to happen.
You'll never believe what happened!
First, I was God. Then I met God!
We locked up some monks!
Oh, no!
We forgot to let them
out of the laundry room!
Do we have to? They're monks.
Their God will let them out...
Or give them more shoes to eat.
Fat chance!
You can't count on God for jack!
He pretty much told me so!
Now come on! If we don't
save those monks, no one will!
When you do things right, people won't
be sure you've done anything at all.
Futurama [4x09] - Futurestock - CiWaN
Good thing I noticed that.
Planet Express stockholders.
I present Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
Oh!
There he is!
Take it off!
Where am I?
Move forward! Walk into the light!
Oh, God! I'm dead! Well, no matter.
Thank you all for coming.
I don't recognize any of you,
nor can I recall why I am here.
Without further ado...
A film highlighting Planet
Express, Inc.'S latest fiscal year.
<i>Planet Express is on the move!</i>
<i>For this hip, young delivery company,
tomorrow is today</i>
<i>And today is yesterday!
You heard me.</i>
<i>It was a year of soaring profiits
and signifiicant one-Time losses.</i>
Watching myself work makes me hungry.
Help me find food.
I'll not only find it,
I'll help you do more to it.
A Bot-Mitzvah!
Shalom, hunger. Shalom, free food.
No shellfish!
That is so unfair.
Tell me about it.
So you guys don't
believe in Robot-Jesus?
He was built and was well-Programmed,
but he wasn't our messiah.
<i>And so, our company flames onwards.</i>
<i>Planet Express: Limitless potential,
boundless horizons!</i>
<i>The unstoppable juggernaut
of the corporate universe!</i>
It's been a terrible year.
The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
But the movie...
A substantial loss for the company.
The blue pie slice represents
the money we earned.
The green slice represents
an $8 bank error in our favor.
What about our thousands
of shares of stock?
Worthless.
I'll kill you!
I own one share of Planet kajiggers,
so I'm entitled to some answers.
Question: Why does no
one visit me in my home?
Your apartment smells
like Polygrip and cat pee!
This is perfect for me!
Do you have to have been
cryogenically frozen to get the free?
You didn't let me finish!
I was going to say "free food"!
My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
Hello, Joe!
When I was frozen,
carrots ruled the earth.
But now they don't.
It takes some getting used to.
In the 1980s,
I was the toast of Wall Street.
I had whiskey with Boesky,
cookies with Milken.
But then, I was diagnosed
with terminal bone-Itis.
Bone-Itis? That's a funny
name for a horrible disease.
There was no cure.
One drug company was close...
But I arranged a hostile takeover
and sold its assets. Made 100 mil.
I froze myself until a cure was found.
And now here I am, ready to sleaze
my way back to the top, '80s style!
As a caveman frozen in a glacier,
I face many challenges.
The hardest thing was seeing my wife
on display in the British Museum.
Oh. Yeah.
I'm from your time.
Remember that song, "Safety Dance"?
<i>Sure do. We can dance</i>
Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun
Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun
That dance wasn't that safe.
I tell you, two go-Go '80s Reaganauts
like us could rule this world!
Right.
If only someone would give us a shot.
They're scared of us. But if you
want a job, I could beg my company.
Awesome. Awesome to the max!
And finally, the post office
meter is for business mail only.
Come on! I've got a lot
of ransom notes to send!
Enough talk! Time for action!
I move that everyone comes over...
To snuggle my cat!
Second.
I move your cat stinks and is ugly!
Second.
I move that we vote on a new
CEO and oust this old creep!
And my cat smells good and is pretty.
Second.
Very well. I nominate the Professor!
Second!
I'm your man!
I vote my shares for the Professor.
The Professor!
Me!
I nominate that guy.
Because he knows about business
and stuff and has a tie.
Shares still count if
they were washed, right?
If I know anything about
which number is bigger...
Hold on! Scruffy votes his
40,000 shares for the stranger.
You have four times as much
stock as the rest of us?
Scruffy believes in this company.
It's a tie. In the event of a tie, the
Professor, as current CEO, remains...
I demand the floor! I may only have
one share, but I get to vote too!
And I'm voting against the cat-Hater!
Isn't that right, kitty?
Hey! You ate my change!
It's settled. The new chief executive
officer of Planet Express is...
"That Guy"!
Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun
Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun
Please welcome our new chief
executive officer, That Guy!
Yeah! Woo-Woo-Woo!
There are two kinds of people:
Sheep and sharks.
Anyone who's a sheep is fired.
Who's a sheep?
Excuse me, which one
do people like to hug?
Gutsy question. You're a shark.
Sharks don't look back...
Because they don't have necks.
Necks are for sheep.
I'm proud to shepherd
this herd of sharks...
And I am gonna lead you to
the top in this industry of...
Package delivery.
Package delivery?! Oh, God!
Fantastic! The first order of business,
blame everything on the guy before me.
Professor?
I'll ruin you like I did this company!
Terrific. Question number one:
What was your overall business plan?
Business plan? Yes. I keep it here,
right next to my heart.
This is no business plan,
it's an escape plan.
So long, suckers!
Fry, as a fellow '80s dollar jockey,
I'm making you my new vice chairman.
I'm rolling up the corporate ramp!
It's the end!
We're ruined!
What fevered dream is this that
bids to tear this company in twain?
Thank you. Come again.
That's what I call a hostile makeover.
Hair gel?
No, thanks. I make my own.
We'll shoot straight to the top
and stay there, like Cindy Lauper!
I ask you, who is the number
one delivery service on earth?
Is it Planet Express, master?
Is this guy a shark or what?
Seriously, we stink.
Here's the big enchirito.
Mom's Friendly Delivery Company.
We can't compete! Her company is big
and evil. We're small and neutral.
Switzerland is small and neutral.
We're Germany, ambitious and misunderstood.
Everyone wants to be like Germany.
Do we have the strength of will?
I say we do! Will we let ourselves
get beaten by an old lady?
Yes, my liege.
No! I speak for the entire board
when I issue this challenge to Mom!
Look at my butt!
Woo! Woo, woo, woo!
You call that a pressed ham?
Walt, hit the retaliate button!
Let's see...
Any button! They all retaliate!
Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him!
This is the high life!
Watching apes kill each other.
In my day, we had coke parties,
but the principle's the same.
Get your stinking trike off me,
you damn, dirty ape!
Now that you're my prot? G?
It's time I cut you in on the
secret to success. Any guesses?
Work really hard?
No.
Oh, thank God!
It's all about appearances.
It's time to update
our company's image...
And give it the sleek,
dazzling veneer of the 1980s!
This company's on the fast
track to the It List. Kudos!
We haven't made one delivery
since you two took over.
Delivery has nothing
to do with our business.
Image, people!
Scope out this new ad!
<i>We are all one. One mind.
One purpose. One act.</i>
<i>Our enemy shall be eaten by scorpions.</i>
<i>And we shall bow down
and worship to ourselves.</i>
<i>Ah!
We shall prevail!</i>
<i>Hey, we were watching that!</i>
Terrible!
People won't know what we do.
I don't know what we do. Just kidding.
What are we, a bus or something?
Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?
I did
And I'll tell you why.
It grows the brand.
Oh, Lord.
This company's circling the drain!
I'd sell my stock for a sandwich.
Sold!
A complete sandwich!
You got fleeced. I would have settled
for a hard roll with ketchup inside.
What is this moose drip?
"The New Delivery Kings"? I'm sick
of hearing about those turtle squirts!
But they're kings, Mommy.
Jam a bastard in it, you crap!
Ow!
Our private dining room. This is where
we serve our most successful chumps.
Tonight, that's us.
What's overpriced?
Everything.
Bring me that.
Me too. And a glass of water.
Okay, let's work on your execu-Speak.
I'm worried about "blank."
Don't worry.
Let me worry about "blank."
Good. I also would have accepted:
"Blank? Blank!
You're not looking at the big picture!"
What a pleasant surprise.
Shut up, booger-Blaster!
It's time we all talk.
I'll handle this, Fry. You get back
to the farm, shift some paradigms.
I'm on it. But if you need me,
you know where I'll be.
Call me a booger-Blaster!
I'll blast a booger
We're worried about Planet Express.
Don't. Let me worry about "blank."
That Guy is a con man, and you've
been hypnotized by his bologna!
You've changed, Fry.
What? I haven't changed.
<i>Suz, have I changed?
No, Mr. Fry.</i>
Thanks, doll.
I don't care. That Guy's turning
this place into some kind of business.
This isn't a business!
I thought of it...
As a source of cheap labor.
Like a family.
Right. We're not a traditional
family like the Murphys...
Or the lesbian coven, but we're a
family. That Guy understands that.
<i>Everyone's fiired,
and we're out of business.</i>
<i>I'm selling Planet Express to Mom.
She'll gut the company, eliminate us.</i>
<i>Don 't let the door
hit you on the way out.</i>
<i>I don 't want ass prints on my new door!</i>
Ms. Johnson, please bring
in some more chair fuel.
I had no idea the company would be
sold! I was just an innocent suck-Up!
Leave us alone and let
us clear out our lockers.
Yeah. Hee-Hee-Hee!
It's so sad!
Where will I go? What will I do?
You have Mrs. Darlinghaven's
cotillion at 7, ma'am.
That'll be fun.
Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me.
Am I a good person?
<i>I don 't know.
I'm a program in the intercom.</i>
I've got to redeem myself!
Somehow, sometime
For some reason,
I'll block this takeover!
<i>Mr. Fry, your 2:00 magician is here.</i>
I have more important things to do
today than laugh and clap my hands.
Reschedule.
Over here! Over here!
Sell 100 soylent beans!
Buy 3000 corn bellies!
200 cans of Whoop-Ass!
Three bags of trash!
Attention. The takeover of PlanEx
by Mom's Delivery Company...
Will take place in 10 minutes.
I am Jorell, master of scheduling!
Okay. We've got the hot tub hot, the
wine coolers cool. It's Hammer time!
You suck!
By regulation, both companies
must approve the takeover.
Planet Express shareholders,
please vote.
Great Bonda of Uganda!
We can vote against it!
I'll vote it down like a
raise for school teachers!
What the?
Oh, no!
The shares I bought from Dr. Zoidberg
gave me majority control.
Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
The shares were worthless!
He asked for toilet paper!
And now if MomCorp shareholders
will cast their ballots.
Um Ah
The ballot was confusing!
How about a hand re-Count?
Okay. Ow!
The takeover of Planet
Express is approved!
This stinks!
Madame is outraged!
Security! I want that bunch
of rowdies out of here!
Wait a minute! Hold on!
MomCorp will purchase all
shares of Planet Express...
At the current market price, which is...
<i>One hundred seven!</i>
Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
What are you solids griping about?
Your shares are worth $107 apiece.
I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an
opinion about the capital gains tax!
Yeah!
I'm even richer!
I have no shares!
Wait! My sandwich! Has it also
appreciated in value? Please!
You didn't refrigerate it, spineless!
You had to drag spines into this!
<i>As vice chairman,
I'd like to say a few words.</i>
<i>A time comes for every man
that deserts his friends...</i>
<i>When he goes back how it was.
For me, that time is now.</i>
So I ask you, as a friend,
stop this deal.
I'm an '80s guy.
Friendship means for $2...
I beat you till you got detached retinas.
The deal will go ahead as...
My bones!
Oh!
Oh, my God! His bone-Itis!
I was so busy being an '80s guy,
I forgot to cure it!
My only regret is...
That I have...
Bone-Itis!
He's dead!
Feed him to the jackals!
Go on with the sale!
I don't think so! As vice chairman,
I gain voting control of his shares.
Don't be a fool!
I'll be whatever I want to do!
That Guy was the
greatest businessman ever.
Before his death,
he taught me everything he knew.
But some things I had to learn myself.
I learned money is fine,
but what counts is people.
You can't put a price on that.
So I'm giving control of the
company to a man of experience...
Professor Hubert Farnsworth!
What? I'm awake! I'm awake!
Stop doing the right thing, jerk!
Let Mom buy it! We want to be rich!
Two out of three doesn't cut it.
You'd rather be rich than work together?
Hell, yeah!
This company was the only place
I ever really felt at home.
If being millionaires is more...
It is.
Important, then I'll sell
Planet Express, for you.
Millionaires nothing! The stock's
only worth three kajiggers!
Come on!
It's worth less now than
when it was worthless!
It is? We're poor no matter
what I do! The deal is off!
Once again, the conservative
sandwich-Heavy portfolio...
Pays off for the hungry investor!
Oh, I'm ruined!
Why? Why?
So we're not millionaires.
But we still get to work together.
Shut your fat mouth!
See you guys Monday!
Futurama [4x10] - A Leela Of Her Own - CiWaN
Put down the binoculars.
The wall of that strip club isn't
gonna collapse twice in one day.
I know. I accept that. Now I'm
interested in that new pizza parlor.
Makes me pine for my days as a delivery
boy. "Here's your pizza," I'd say.
"I didn't order any," they'd say.
Then off to my next adventure.
That story stunk.
Hand me the binoculars.
The owner is from Signas-Five.
Signoids? On our block?
They should go back where they came from.
Society's never gonna make progress...
Until we learn to pretend
to like each other.
Let's make these hideous
strangers feel welcome.
No.
You sure about these chairs? Guidebook
says human legs bend down at knee.
It's okay, Mama.
Anyone complains, I bend
legs up for free. Customers.
Welcome to Earth Pizza Store.
Here, sit. I bend the knees for you.
That's comfy.
What kind of pizza goes in you?
Silt? Asbestos?
We got guano, very fresh.
Have any food?
Here, try a deep-Dish pizza.
Contains four kinds of things.
This tastes like vomit.
Thank you.
Actually, I mean to offend a little.
This is awful.
What's wrong?
Was it something Leela said?
We come to Earth to start new life,
raise fat, spoiled Earth kids...
Hang many underwear from Earth
clothesline, live Earthican dream.
Don't cry, foreign people.
I used to work in a pizzeria.
As soon as I stop blasting puke...
I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza.
Thank you, magic biped.
You save us, sir. If we cannot make
Earth Pizza, our dream will die.
Just like rats we
crushed to make the wine.
For starters, use quality ingredients.
Case in point? No more live bees.
When you put pizzas in the oven,
don't get in with them.
<i>Hey, ocupado.</i>
Most important of all
is the big-Screen TV.
Families need a TV so they
don't have to talk to each other.
The Earthican pastime. Blernsball.
<i>Mulligan drives the ball.
It's going and caught by the shortstop.</i>
<i>Mets lose again. I haven 't seen play
this bad since the days of Bob Uecker.</i>
<i>This is Bob Uecker saying
thanks for watching.</i>
Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter?
I don't understand this Blernsball.
We'll teach you. Your pizzeria will
play a game against Planet Express.
But you'll need nine players.
No problem.
Play the ball.
Go, team. Beat those no-Good Signoids.
Show them they stink in a
game they've never played.
Ah, this is why I love Earth.
Beautiful star-Brightened day,
friendly Blernsball game with chum pals.
So pleasant for everybody.
Hit by a pitch. Take your base.
Sorry about that. I guess
I needed a few more warm-Up pitches.
No batter, no batter.
No batter anymore.
Take your base.
I didn't mean to hit you.
I have trouble with depth perception.
Yeah. Me too, now.
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter.
Hey, duck.
Take your base.
Please, I want to live.
Can I use bat to protect head?
Apparently not.
Check out the one-Eyed bean machine.
Hooray, I make a score point.
You beaned a run in.
Better let me pitch.
But I've got a no-Hitter going.
You're right. Here.
Don't take her out.
She's a firecracker.
I'd like to talk to you.
Am I under arrest?
You're the sleaze bag who owns
the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
Now I'm the sleaze bag who
owns the New New York Mets.
The Mets?
Those bums are worse than me.
But they don't draw a crowd like you.
Which is why I want to sign you.
You mean, I'd be the first woman
ever to play major league blernsball?
It'd be a publicity stunt.
A one-Eyed lady might bring
out the freak show crowd.
Wow, the first woman ever to
play major league blernsball.
Again, yeah. But you'd just be...
Yippee!
The first woman ever to play major
league blernsball. How do I look?
Like a sexy Yogi Berra.
Why is your number 7/8?
The whole numbers have been retired.
I'm impressed.
You look just like a ball player.
Can I pat you on the butt?
I'm a professional athlete.
So go ahead.
Now I'm too nervous.
The Swedes have already turned
this one into a "laffer".
And that's with two "F's."
The crowd is pouring out L.A. -Style.
Skipper, we're losing the crowd.
Put in our new novelty act, Leela.
I already put in the circus clown.
But he bunted. Clowns are only
funny when they swing away.
<i>Your attention please.
Pitching for the Mets, Turanga Leela.</i>
<i>A one-Eyed woman.</i>
Come on, throw like a girl.
Go, Leela.
Too much eyeliner.
This is history in the making.
Bjornson steps up to the plate,
and Leela delivers.
Bull's-Eye.
An inauspicious start for the career
of the first woman blernsballer.
An inauspicious continuation for the
career of the first woman blernsballer.
Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean...
It's a three-Bean, ball salad.
The Mets fans love it, though.
They haven't had much
to cheer about this year.
That was great. You got more publicity
than a cowboy in a shark tank.
Poor Tex. He was quite a shark.
Hey!
Come on!
I win.
Sorry.
How did you get in here?
As your agent, I have access.
Since when are you my agent?
Quiet! Call coming in.
Yes? A big endorsement
deal for Leela? How much?
You put a one and two zeros in
front of that, or we pass. Deal.
That's great. How much did you get me?
One hundred dollars!
As a pitcher, I serve
up plenty of bean balls.
So I know good beans when I see them.
Bean-Bay Beans! They're the beaniest!
Cut!
Bean! Bean! Bean!
In short order,
Leela has become a fan favorite.
You're the best, babe. Hang on.
You put a one and two zeros in
front of that, or we pass. Deal.
So, what did you get me?
A thousand and one pesos.
Cut. Now do one with the bean suit on.
Leela bringing in customers.
This keep up, we need to
buy second sauce toilet.
I want to injure men by throwing stuff
at them, just like you. Will you sign?
Sure thing, sweetie.
Who should I make it out to?
To eBay?
That's a popular name today.
Little "E," big "B"?
Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans,
add a one and two zeros, we got a wad.
I'm doing it for all the female
athletes who need a role model.
A role model for how to stink.
What? Who are you?
Jackie Anderson.
I'm on the team at NNYU.
I was hoping to play in the majors.
Following in my footsteps.
God forbid! Your freak show
is making it impossible...
For female players
to be taken seriously.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Show's over, no refunds.
You heard the robot. Get out!
Fans haven't been cheering for me.
They've been cheering at me.
Don't be upset, Leela.
You look really cute in your uniform.
That's what makes it so sad!
I thought I was doing something heroic!
You are! What about that little girl
you visited in the hospital who died?
You're right.
I can't let people down anymore.
God's my witness, I vow to earn the
respect of girls and women everywhere!
I will become the best
blernsball player of all time!
That's statistically impossible. In 77
innings, you haven't gotten one out.
At this rate, you'll be the
worst player of all time.
Oh. Then I have a new vow.
I solemnly swear
I will become not the worst
blernsball player of all time!
Look! The players who broke
the various color barriers!
When will man learn that all races
are equally inferior to robots?
If I could be just a little better
than him, I can hold my head high.
He once struck out when his
tongue stuck to a cold bat.
He tried to catch with an oven mitt!
It's a crummy hologram.
I'm not a hologram.
Hank Aaron the 24th.
How could you play so badly?
The original Hank Aaron was great!
I was better than great.
I was the home run king.
Neat!
So, Hank, the bad Hank,
just how bad were you?
My batting average was low.
Low? It was zero! You went your
whole career without getting a hit.
Leela beats that. She pitched
without ever getting an out!
You stink! Junior, she belongs
in the exhibit instead of you!
Forget it!
This job's too cushy to give up.
Wade Boggs, goes down smooth.
I don't want to be in this exhibit.
I need your help, so I can be one
tiny iota less pathetic than you.
I can't help you play better
than Tiny lota. He was great!
But I'll teach you all I know.
Okay, let's see what you can do.
She can lodge a ball in your brain.
You better get a batting helmet.
All right, low and away.
Okay, try it again. But this time,
keep your eye off the ball.
You mean on the ball?
Who's in the hall of fame?
You're holding the bat upside down.
Just pitch the ball!
Okay, eye off the ball.
Strike!
Man, you did it, Leela!
I didn't hit the batter! I was
pitching and not just belly-Itching!
Oh, you got that too?
I think there's a rash going around.
Welcome to Fenway where the Mets end
a season that ranks among the worst.
You opened a franchise!
Yes. Our biggest seller
is Leela's Bean Pizza!
Six kinds of beans plus
things that look like beans.
Beans, huh?
This is great!
How do you make the crust so fizzy?
Ancient Signoid secret.
My husband, some hotshot.
Here's his ancient Signoid secret.
Live hornets.
We smoosh them right into dough.
I don't care if it's horse manure.
That's good.
I want to buy this franchise.
How's $ 100,000?
No! We come to Earth to
make pizza, not money!
No, Blek! Other way around.
Right. Offer accepted!
Fans, Boston's turning the last
game into a real "squeeeker".
And that's with three "E's"! Two men on,
and they're down to their last out.
It's my last chance to prove
I'm not the worst player ever.
Put me in.
No! We're actually winning this game!
You only go in as a joke
when we're eight runs behind!
Come on!
Let's see some fundamentals out there!
And not clown fundamentals!
Darn! Darn! Darn!
Now the bases are loaded!
Isn't there a man who
can get one more out?!
I can!
I repeat. Isn't there a man on...
I've been training with Hank Aaron!
The Hank Aaron?
I've trained with a Hank Aaron.
All right then
Get in there and pitch like you've
never pitched like you before!
<i>Now pitching for the Mets,
Turanga Leela!</i>
Bean! Bean! Bean!
Go, Leela! Go!
Go, Leela!
Put it down the pike!
Strike him out! Do it for the
hundreds of women everywhere!
<i>Now pinch-Hitting for the
Poindexters, Jackie Anderson!</i>
Look! College blernsball's
finest female hitter...
Making her debut against
the worst female anything.
I've never seen anything this weird
and I've seen Mr. Belvedere naked!
Keep cool.
She's like any other player.
She puts on her sports
bra one arm at a time.
Strike one!
Strike one! A personal best!
Strike two!
This moment is brought to
you by Month Old Franks...
The hot dogs with experience!
A grand slam blern! The Mets lose!
Their season is over!
Leela, the first woman
ever to reach the majors...
Will go down as the worst player
in the history of blernsball.
She's taught the world that
being a bum knows no gender.
Tonight we've seen the
start of a great career...
For the first woman to play
the sport well, Jackie Anderson!
Leela?
Jackie. I guess you were right...
I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
No, don't be.
You were an inspiration after all.
I was?
You were so awful that women set out
to prove they don't stink as bad as you.
That's so kind of you.
I guess I made a difference after all.
You absolutely did, Leela.
Now please
Please retire. Immediately.
Hey, kid! Catch.
You're still the worst
football player of all time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Futurama [4x11] - 30% Iron Chef - CiWaN
<i>Welcome back. Our next guest has taught
the world to cook for over 20 years.</i>
<i>But apparently my wife
hasn't been listening.</i>
<i>Funny.
I will destroy her!</i>
<i>And now, extend a formulaic
greeting to master chef Elzar.</i>
<i>So, what will you be cooking for
Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?</i>
<i>I'm gonna whip you up a nice,
unnamable horror from beyond...</i>
<i>With mango chutney.</i>
<i>Pathetic humans,
prepare to write down the recipe!</i>
What's with the pots and pans?
Building a wife?
Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up
a tasty Sunday brunch for my friends.
Brunch. Right. I'd better warn...
Tell... Warn-Tell the others.
Okey-Dokey.
Nice.
Yes. It's a perfect scale model
of the universe's largest bottle.
I put a tiny spaceship inside
to keep it from being boring.
Oh!
Get! For the last time, Zoidberg
Look with your eyes, not your claws!
Brace yourselves.
Bender is making us brunch.
Oh, boy!
Oh, God, my tract!
He's proud of his cooking.
If we don't eat, he'll be crushed.
Don't panic. If we can get to
the ship, we'll fly north...
And hide under the polar icecaps.
Good idea!
What's the holdup?
Fleeing somewhere?
With you blocking the only
escape route? Don't be silly.
In that case, brunch is served.
Let's go, move it out! Stop crying, Leela.
Zoidberg, are you coming?
Sure. Me.
I don't want you touching that thing!
I know that.
Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg.
Oh, no, professor will hit me! But if
Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts.
Oh! Ow. What?
I've personalized each of your meals.
For example, Amy, you're cute,
so I baked you a pony.
Come on, eat!
I slaved all day over a filthy stove.
This is terrible!
Good thing I secretly installed
this wormhole in the table.
Where does the other end come out?
You know, I'm not quite sure.
Dear me.
The pie is ready.
You guys like swarms of things, right?
Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg.
Act naturally.
Ouch! Ouch! Oh! Ah! Oh!
Get off of me! Stop!
How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg.
Do go on.
Check out the palm tree.
It gets sick when I cook brunch.
How's that for coincidence, professor,
with all your precious science?
I don't want to hurt his feelings,
but this tastes better as vomit.
It's unbearable. What would it
cost to get my tongue removed?
And this time I mean it!
Who am I kidding? It was stupid
of me to dream of becoming a chef.
I don't have what it takes,
and nothing can change that.
Then it's settled.
Elzar will teach me to cook!
Absolutely not.
But I watch your show. You owe me.
I owe you nothing!
One, your antenna's in my crotch.
Also, I hate you.
And finally, you can't cook for squat.
What was the first one?
I hate you.
I thought that was number two.
I knocked it up a notch. Bam!
I'll never recombobulate this ship.
When the professor finds out,
he'll tear me a new cloaca!
Wait. What would the robot do?
Frame someone.
What up?
<i>I'm walking on sunshine...</i>
It's over. My dream of being a chef
is deader than the cat I'm sitting on.
Gus, let's give a friendly
welcome to this new robo.
What did you call me?
A "robo". You know, a robot hobo.
Okay. I thought you said "romo."
No offense intended, my filthy friend.
In fact, why not join us
and ride the space rails?
Get ready. We's gonna jump
off at that switching prism.
We're going nearly the speed of light,
so roll when you land.
Ow!
Welcome to Bumbase Alpha,
biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.
I've seen bigger.
Wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon.
Wait, a pie with hobo-Lifting aroma?
Who baked it?
Helmut Spargle.
He used to be the greatest chef.
His restaurant was so
high-Toned, to get reservations...
You had to create a parallel
universe, where you had reservations!
I once ate there, back
when I was a senator.
Yo, Spargle, if you're such a great
cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
Ages ago, I was the host of a TV show:
Down-Home Country Kitchen
with Helmut Spargle.
<i>One day, the Extreme Soda
Company that sponsored the show...</i>
<i>Decided it was too old-Fashioned.
Spargle, you're fired.</i>
We need a chef who attracts a younger,
more extreme cooking-Show viewer.
Elzar!
Get lost, old man.
<i>Bam!
Mein souffl?!</i>
Elzar had been seduced by
the dark side of cooking.
Cilantro, mango salsa,
raspberry vinaigrette.
That twizzler.
As for me, I went temporarily
insane and wound up here...
Making pies out of shoes.
My story's like yours,
only interesting. It involves robots.
That jerk, Elzar, ruined my
dream of being a chef too.
Interesting. You wish to cook, but as
a robot, you have no sense of taste.
It's so unfair.
I have eight other senses...
But I'd trade them all,
even smision, to be able to taste!
Without the distraction of taste...
Your mind is free to touch
the Zen of pure flavor.
You could be the greatest chef!
I could?
Just as Beethoven was a great
composer because he was deaf!
Or how Rembrandt was
blind and had wooden hands!
Bender, hear me well.
I shall train you.
First, forget everything
you know of cooking.
Done.
Wow.
That's right, Ricardo.
A ship in a bottle.
What's that?
Well, hang on, I'll look.
I've gathered you in
the accusing parlor...
Because one of you is a
miniature-Ship wrecker.
I'm acting astonished.
Certain clues suggest the culprit is
none other than our own Philip J. Fry.
What?
It was a brilliant scheme...
But you made one fatal mistake:
Leaving this confession note!
Scoundrel.
I don't remember any of that...
But I can't defend myself.
I have no choice but to charge you the
full cost of the materials. $10.00.
There you go.
What have I done?
Your training is complete,
little dessert spoon.
Just as he who wishes to be world
chess champion must win at least...
One game of chess, so must you
serve at least one edible meal.
Succeed and I shall reveal to you...
The age-Old secret of perfect flavor.
Slop's on.
Fine-Looking eats.
It is acceptable.
All right!
Another thing I'm great at!
Wait, why'd you stop eating, master?
Because my stomach is about to explode.
What? My dinner killed you? Man!
It hurts.
Stay confident. The important thing
is, you defeat Elzar after I am gone.
And using this, you cannot fail.
A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?
No, it is the essence of pure flavor.
A few drops will cause the inner
perfection of any dish to blossom forth.
Oh! There goes my...
Life!
I'll avenge you, master!
I swear, in the presence
of these drunken bums...
That I shall defeat Elzar!
I'm not drunk. I'm mentally ill.
But I likes what, what you said.
Elzar, I'm a walking pile
of your unfinished business!
Why, you...
Helmut Spargle has a message for you!
He says, "I'm dead."
Spargle? What'd he do,
bland himself to death?
No, he was eating some food I made and
by coincidence, his stomach exploded.
Now I'm here to avenge him!
Seems you're the one who killed him.
Maybe so, but you're his sworn enemy!
I challenge you to a
battle of the chefs!
Scandalous!
We'll meet on the ancient televised
battleground of Kitchen Coliseum.
Whosever meal is best will
claim the title of Iron Cook.
Iron Cook? I can't lose.
I'm 30% iron.
You're going down!
Also, I had a reservation
for one, under Dr. Bender.
<i>Welcome the superintendent of
Kitchen Coliseum, Chairman Koji!</i>
<i>No robot chef has competed here.</i>
<i>But today, one has barged his way
in to challenge for the title of:</i>
Iron Cook!
Yeah, you show him!
Meet our celebrity judges.
<i>Globetrotter Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate.
Konnichiwa, brother.</i>
TV anchor-Monster Morbo.
Greetings, pathetic host.
A woman who ended a galactic
war with apple dandies...
Martha Stewart's head.
The secret is fresh pork.
<i>Koji will present the theme
ingredient to be used in every dish.</i>
If it's chicken, chicken? La king.
Fish, fish? La king.
Turkey, fish? La king.
Soylent Green!
<i>A classic ingredient of gourmet
cooking. And the battle is on.</i>
<i>What's Elzar making?
Well, Hiroki-San, when I asked him...</i>
He asked what it was to me and
conjectured my mother was a prostitute.
In the countryside, prostitutes
decorate rooms with festive gourds.
<i>Thirty minutes to go.</i>
<i>Look at him roll dough!</i>
I've never seen such
powerful strokes of the ass.
You've never seen mine.
No, I haven't.
<i>Fifteen minutes remaining.</i>
<i>He's bringing in his
signature creation...</i>
<i>A working pastry replica
of downtown Venice.</i>
Commemorative turkey basters.
Get your commemorative basters.
Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry,
and I've tried everything.
Right. Never mind.
The guilt. The unbearable guilt!
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>
Bam!
<i>Ten seconds.</i>
Master Spargle, if you can hear me
up in that ditch, where I left you...
This is for you.
Time up!
<i>He's gone all out for the judges.</i>
<i>He's even garnished the salad with
$100 bills. Let's see what they think.</i>
Mmm... Soylent Green
is my kind of people.
Scrumptious. Morbo will store this
in his sack for future digestion.
I'm swimming in my Soylent waste.
It's a good thing.
<i>Next up, Bender, a student
of legendary Helmut Spargle...</i>
<i>Bender is some sort of
wonderful mechanical man.</i>
Ooo... Delicious.
This food looks kind of funky,
but it tastes kind of funk-Ay!
The challenger's ugly food
shows even hideous things...
Can be sweet on the inside.
Now judgment.
The winner will be the new Iron Cook.
The loser is doomed to scrub.
Whose confection achieves perfection?
Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff?
Challenger Bender!
That's my robot! I own him!
<i>You honor me, Chairman Koji.
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.</i>
Chairman-San, I came
here with one goal:
To humiliate Elzar in a large
stadium. I believe I've done that.
No question.
But the true Zen of flavor
is not found in a coliseum.
It is found in a small
kitchen with friends.
So I decline the title of Iron Cook...
And accept only the lesser title of
Zinc Saucier, which I just made up.
Also, it comes with double prize money.
Wait. Everyone must know.
I broke the professor's bottled ship!
And what is worse,
I framed my dearest friend, Fry!
I can never repay him his $10,
so I must take the only honorable path...
What with the killing myself.
Here I go already!
Huh?
Oh! That sword cost $5000!
Fry did it.
And that's how I defeated Elzar,
thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
Yes, we were there,
and we just watched it again on TV.
Let me see that vial, Bender.
Good Lord!
According to the spectrolizer...
Spargle's magic ingredient was water!
Ordinary water.
No!
So the real gift Spargle gave you
was the confidence to be your best.
Yes, ordinary water, laced with nothing
more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
The important thing is, by my
standards, I won fair and square.
Now, who wants brunch cooked
with plenty of "confidence"?
I'm in!
I do!
Shatner's log, airdate unknown.
The impossible has happened.
It would take days to recount the
events I've witnessed, so settle in.
It all began--
Quiet, you! This court-Martial
is now in session.
The honorably sexy
Zapp Brannigan residing.
Bring in the accused!
Oh, my.
Philip J. Fry, you stand
accused of traveling...
To the forbidden planet Omega 3...
A crime punishable by 12
concurrent death sentences.
Do you understand the charges?
One beep for yes, two beeps for no.
Yes. So noted. Do you plead guilty?
Double yes. Guilty! I will now
carry out the sentence. Kif, my gun.
Wait! He pled not guilty!
Order! Order in the court!
Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount
the events that led you to be guilty.
The professor said he was taking a nap,
so we have time for six movies.
Let's take these six Jim Carrey
movies and record over them!
You know what six movies
average out to be good?
The first six Star Trek movies!
Everybody hit the deck!
Shh! Those words are forbidden.
What words? Star Trek?
Shh!
Shut your gills!
That sound, it's patrol car 718!
Hide him!
The court is intrigued.
Perhaps we could hear more
about these forbidden words...
From someone with a
sexily seductive voice.
With pleasure. You see, the show
was banned after the Star Trek Wars.
You mean the vast
migration of Star Wars fans?
No. That was the Star Wars Trek.
By the 23rd century,
Star Trek fandom had evolved...
From a loose association of nerds with
skin problems into a full-Blown religion.
And Scotty beamed them
to the Klingon ship...
Where they would be no tribble at all.
All power to the engines.
As countries fell under its influence...
World leaders were threatened
by the movement's power.
And so the Trekkies were executed
in the manner most befitting virgins.
He's dead, Jim.
He's dead, Jim.
He's dead, Jim.
Finally, the sacred texts were banned.
The last copies of the 79 episodes
and six movies were dumped...
On the forbidden world Omega 3...
Along with that blooper reel where
the door doesn’t close all the way.
Thus, Star Trek was forever
scoured from human memory.
Another classic science-Fiction
show cancelled before its time.
I've never heard of such a
brutal and shocking injustice...
That I cared so little about.
Next witness!
Bender the Robot, please take the stand.
She's all yours, buddy.
I'd only met the defendant, Fry,
once, but I knew he was up to no good.
Please use the beeps.
Oh.
Mr. Nimoy! I came as soon as I heard
what happened centuries ago.
I can't believe your show was banned!
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.
You know, 1966?
79 episodes, about 30 good ones.
Oh, really! I've done too many things
to remember one particular TV series...
But if you want to discuss
my books of poetry--
Remember that episode where you got
high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
No. Perhaps you're thinking
of my one-Man show...
About Vincent van Spock?
I mean, van Gogh. Damn!
Aha! You can't escape it!
Oh, you're right, I can't.
Uh. Jeez, don't get upset.
I mean, okay,
I outwitted you, but--
No, it's my fellow cast members.
300 years ago, they left Earth behind.
This planet doesn't
appreciate us anymore, Leonard.
Bill, you are and always
shall be my friend.
But I just signed a six-Month
lease on my apartment.
I can't walk away from
a commitment like that.
Farewell, my friend.
Oh.
Why did the world turn its
back on our obvious greatness?
I'm literally angry with rage!
Your co-Stars may be gone, but we can
still get those episode tapes back...
For the whole world to see! Come on!
Oh.
Yes! Front row!
You can't go to Omega 3.
It's forbidden. I forbid you!
We have to! The world needs Star Trek
to give people hope for the future.
But it's set 800 years in the past.
Yeah! Why is this so important to you?
'Cause it taught me so much.
Like how you should accept people,
whether they be black, white...
Klingon, or even female.
But most importantly,
when I didn't have any friends...
It made me feel like maybe I did.
Well, that is touchingly pathetic.
I guess I can't let you go alone.
I'll go too. With Leonard's
permission, of course.
We're entering the Omega System.
Warning.
You are now in forbidden space.
Forbidden, schmur-Schmidden.
What are they gonna do, write a letter?
I'm so scared!
I've lost control of the ship!
Oh, dip!
Dip, indeed.
It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
So many cardboard sets, so many
memories. If only the others--
I guess that's my cue.
Bill!
L-Dog!
Hey! This is wonderful!
Oh, man!
I feel like hugging you.
Well, I would, except you have no body.
And we're both men.
Nichelle! George! Walter!
DeForest! Welshie!
Welshie?
We did some musical reunion
specials in the 2200s.
But the guy who played
Scotty had trouble yodeling.
Ever since then, Welshie has been
a welcome participant in our escapades.
I can't believe it!
How'd you all end up here?
We were going to Welshie's cousin's
house to stay in the guest room...
When our ship was pulled down to this
planet and crashed, just like yours.
When we woke up, we had bodies.
Say it in Russian.
Ven vee voke up,
vee had these wah-Dies.
Now say "nuclear wessels"!
No!
We love it here. Everything is
provided for us and we never age.
Check out these abs.
Yowsa!
But who's doing all this for you?
You know, we never thought about it.
We're famous, we're used
to this sort of treatment.
It is I!
Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
I'm not an effect!
You doubt my power?
I do!
Aye!
Welshie!
This court will now hear
some very sensual testimony...
From this court's ex-Lover,
Turanga Leela.
Go * * * * yourself.
Behold, another power!
Different from the one you saw earlier.
Hey! A body! Buff, tan.
Yeah, this is mine, all right.
All right, you gas, what's the deal?
Centuries ago, the videotaped
adventures of the Enterprise crew...
Rained down upon my planet.
Over and over, I watched them.
Especially the five
with the energy beings.
I am Melllvar, Seer of the Tapes!
Knower of the Episodes!
Tremble before my encyclopedic
knowledge of Star Trek!
Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows
more about Star Trek than me!
I beg to differ!
Long have I waited for the one who
played Spock. At last, we can begin.
Cool! A Star Trek convention!
Melllvar, can you give us some idea
how long this is going to last?
Until time stops.
What?
You can't do this!
Now, we have a full schedule of events.
Can people who hate Star Trek leave?
Good question.
No, you have to stay even longer!
Oh!
Sign it to Melllvar.
Melllvar has three L's.
I think I've done enough conventions
to know how to spell Melllvar.
Say "nerd"!
Nerd!
I'm Slim Shady.
Yes, I'm the real Shady.
All you other Slim Shadys
are just imitating.
So won't the real Slim
Shady please stand up?
Please stand up? Please stand up?
How can you do a spoken
word version of a rap song?
He found a way.
For 100 quatloos, who did the
captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
Khan!
Uh, Khan?
Correct!
My button has broken!
The trivia contest has ended.
I now have a surprise.
You will perform a fan script
written by the ultimate Trek fan!
You have my fan script?
I meant me! Melllvar's the ultimate fan!
Oh, I was confused because the
scoreboard says something different.
Trivia contest over! Take your scripts!
We have limited rehearsal time.
Now, I didn't make enough
copies of the script...
So George and Walter will have to share.
You probably don't want us to see you
rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending.
That's right!
The ending must not be ruined!
We'll go wait in the ship.
Okay.
Not till I get my 600 quatloos!
This is wrong. We shouldn't
have abandoned them there.
I'm feeling pretty good about it.
I didn't want to leave them either,
but what were we supposed to do?
Usually on the show, someone would
come up with a complicated plan...
Then explain it with a simple analogy.
Hmm. If we can re-Route engine
power through the primary weapons...
And reconfigure them to
Melllvar's frequency...
That should overload his
electro-Quantum structure.
Like putting too much air in a balloon!
Of course! It's so simple!
Alas, my ship, whom I love
like a woman, is disabled.
Oh, Lord.
Fascinating, captain, and logical too.
Yet, we need some help.
Look, captain! Melllvar will help us.
Captain, I wope he will welp our vessel.
Wessel!
You're not acting hard enough!
Melllvar, you have to
respect your actors.
When I directed Star Trek IV,
I got a magnificent performance...
Out of Bill because I respected him.
And when I directed Star Trek V, I got
a magnificent performance out of me...
Because I respected me so much!
Okay! I'm done re-Ca-Foobelling
the energy motron, or whatever!
Fire!
My, what a handsome energy
creature you are! I love you.
Hey, you wrote it!
It's not working! He's drawing
strength from our weapons!
Like a balloon,
and something bad happens!
Yep.
So how's rehearsal going?
Lousy. Here I've been admiring
a bunch of actors while you...
A crew of genuine space heroes,
risked your lives to save them.
Hey, we've done heroic things too.
Yeah! In the third season,
I kissed Shatner.
Silence! My whole world has turned
upside down. I have but one option.
Keep them and let us go?
No!
To determine who is more worthy
of my fanatical devotion...
I shall pit you against
each other in armed combat...
To the death!
Where'd you get an
idiotic idea like that?
Episodes 1 9, 46, 56 and 77.
Great list, except you forgot episode 66!
I was getting to that one!
So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death.
I assume no one survived.
Can we get on with this?
My foot's getting tired.
This will be your standard
battle to the death.
The only weapons, whatever you can find.
But I warn you, do nothing until
I have signaled the start of combat.
Okay, start.
I don't have much experience at fighting,
except with you guys.
I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode
where I threw my shoe at the enemy?
You mean Doohan?
Whoever it was, I did it like this.
Ow!
My foot's cold.
There, we can make these into spears.
We can tie caterpillars together to
make bowstrings for bows and arrows.
And we can use this
machine gun to shoot them!
Yee-Haa!
Ha-Ha. That was fun.
What if I distract them
with my famous fan dance?
That's good, good. And then, George,
you give them a karate chop.
I find that offensive.
Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry,
you assume I know karate.
Have I ever led you to
believe I have studied karate?
Well, no. But you never
talk about yourself.
Maybe if you showed a little interest.
Well, here goes nothing.
Hello, boys.
Oh!
Hi-Ya!
There's no right way to hit a woman.
Then do it the wrong way.
Fine.
Is that all you got?
Ow!
Come on, Walter!
Take that!
That hurts!
Let's see if this actually works. Hmm.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
My face!
Ow! My face too!
May l?
Excellent, excellent.
Leela, please.
This is exactly what Melllvar wants.
We're just pawns in his
diabolical game of checkers.
Can't we resolve our
differences some other way?
Melllvar! Dinnertime!
But, Mom, I'm playing
with my collectibles!
Now!
Uh.
All this time we thought he
was a powerful super being...
Yet he was just a child.
He's not a child! He's 34!
All right, Koenig!
I've wanted to do this for years!
Bender, wait! This is our chance
to escape before Melllvar comes back!
But we all need to work together.
I love you so much.
Hello?
We've decided to work together.
So did they.
Now, how do we escape?
We can't use our ship. We have life
support, but the engines are wrecked.
Ironic, because our engines work,
but our life-Support systems don't.
Hey, if your engines work.
And your life-Support systems work.
Stop! You're just
going around in circles!
Think, Fry, think.
Everyone's depending on you.
We're too heavy! You guys
need to lose some weight, fast!
Look, Leonard, we're light enough
to keep the tapes! Isn’t that great?
I'm living in a gefilte-Fish jar.
We did it!
Melllvar's got a spaceship!
Yes! In mint condition, and you
made me take it out of the package!
The Nimbus! We're saved!
You're under arrest!
Prepare to be boarded.
So I boarded you, huh?
What happened next?
You started this stupid court-Martial!
If you don't mind,
we're still fighting Melllvar.
One more hit and we're done for!
Let's take him out with us.
Do you have a self-Destruct code?
Like destruct sequence 1 -A, 2-B, 3--
Thanks a lot, Takei.
Now everybody knows!
If I can 't have the original cast of
Star Trek, no one will. Prepare to die!
Wait! If they mean that much to you,
why would you kill them?
Because l. I.
I don 't know what I'd do without them.
Melllvar, you can't let a
TV show be your whole life.
You can do anything you want.
Look at Walter Koenig.
After Star Trek, he became an actor.
Not just an actor,
but a well-Rounded person...
With my own friends and
credit cards and keys.
Well, I guess I could move
out of my parent's basement...
Maybe get a temp job.
Whoa. Whoa! One step at a time.
I thank you, Fry. You know,
you and I are of a kind.
In a different reality,
I could have called you "friend. "
Episode 10: "Balance of Terror. "
More like episode nine, loser!
In your face! Victory is mine!
I wonder, my friends, was he
really such an evil energy gas?
He did give us eternal youth.
24-Hour Laundromat.
A full assortment of rum,
both spiced and regular.
Truly, it was a paradise.
And all you had to put up with was
one really annoying Star Trek fan.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Futurama [5x01] - Crimes Of The Hot - CiWaN
Hurry up with the water.
I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am.
It's that hot, it is.
Man, it's hot. How hot is it?
It's so hot, I poured McDonald's
coffee in my lap to cool off.
Johnny Carson said it.
No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water!
It's full of chlorine.
Lightweights.
Oh, wait, chlorine.
Perhaps this movie will help
take our minds off the heat.
Focus!
Global Warming
or: None Like It Hot!
You're probably wondering
why your ice cream went away.
Well, Suzie, the culprit isn't foreigners.
It's global warming.
Gwobal wap-Po?
Yeah.
Meet Mr. Sunbeam. He comes all the
way from the sun to visit Earth.
Hello, Earth.
Just popping in to brighten your day.
La-La-La-La-La-La-La.
And now I'll be on my way.
Not so fast, sunbeam.
We're greenhouse gases.
You ain't going nowhere.
Oh, God, it hurts!
Pretty soon, Earth is
chock-Full of sunbeams...
Their rotting corpses
heating our atmosphere.
How do we get rid of
the greenhouse gases?
Fortunately, our handsomest
politicians came up with a cheap...
Last-Minute way to
combat global warming.
Ever since 2063,
we simply drop a giant ice cube...
Into the ocean every now and then.
Just like Daddy puts in
his drink every morning.
And then he gets mad.
Of course, since the greenhouse
gases are still building up...
It takes more and more ice each time.
Thus, solving the
problem once and for all.
But--
Once and for all!
Well, we just need one
of those big ice cubes.
Call the losers who were
supposed to deliver it.
Hello?
President Nixon here.
I'm hiring you losers to
deliver the ice. And hurry up.
I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover
trying to squeeze into a new girdle.
You heard the good news, everyone.
Save the Earth, et cetera, et cetera. Bye.
Wait. Where do we get the ice?
The what?
Oh, Halley's comet, of course.
The only sufficient source of ice
cubes that don't have bugs in them.
Wow. Mining a comet.
That sounds fun.
Yes. There's no safer
occupation than mining.
Especially when you're
perched on a snowball...
Whipping through space at
a million miles an hour.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Safe.
Deploying ice drill.
Wow. That ice dispenser's
so big the ice crushes you.
Yakov Smirnoff said it.
No, he didn't.
Activating ice drill.
Oh, my God! It's out of ice!
Like some outer-Space Motel 6.
Completely out of ice?
This could mean the end of the
banana daiquiri as we know it.
Also life.
With Halley's comet out of ice...
Earth is experiencing the devastating
effects of intense global warming.
Morbo is pleased but sticky.
The scorching heat has
melted the polar icecaps...
Causing floods of biblical proportion.
They called me crazy
for building this ark.
You are crazy. You filled it
with same-Sex animal couples.
Hey! There are parts of the Bible
I like and parts I don't like.
Direct your pity now to
the African turtles...
Seen here migrating to
cooler homes in Holland.
That poor turtle.
No. Never.
Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads
peace amongst the Dutch tulips.
I'm sure those windmills
will keep them cool.
Windmills do not work that way!
Good night!
Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle.
What have you done with your lives?
You went all the way to Holland already?
Bender, a turtle isn't yourself.
Why do you care about it?
Because I also care deeply about
things that remind me of myself.
Like poor little Shelly here.
What could you possibly have in
common with this walking soup mix?
For one thing, we both
have a tough outer shell.
But lead a rich, inner life.
And also...
Well, you know.
You're both alcoholic, whore-Mongering,
chain-Smoking gamblers?
No. It's just...
Neither of us can get up when
we get knocked on our back.
What? I've seen you get up
off your back tons of times.
Those times I was slightly on my side.
Interesting.
Maybe we should test this erectile
dysfunction of yours, Bender.
No, that's not necessary, really.
I think I hear my factory recalling me.
That's what I get for sharing
my vulnerability with you.
Calling all scientists.
There will be a worldwide conference
on global warming in Kyoto, Japan.
I've got a degree in
homeopathic medicine.
You've got a degree in baloney.
Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist.
Forget it. I'm not going.
I have my reasons.
Shut up, all of you!
Strange.
You haven't acted this suspicious since
I found the "ape bones" in the basement.
My hip hurts. I'm in the
middle of cooking a turkey.
I have warranty cards to fill out.
I am not just making excuses.
All right, I'll go!
I can't believe it!
I love you!
It's Professor Hubert Farnsworth!
He's looking sharp in a standard
white lab coat and dark slacks.
His wristwatch is a Casio.
Thank you all for coming.
It is my pleasure to introduce the host
of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention.
The inventor of the environment and
first emperor of the moon, AI Gore.
I have ridden the mighty moon worm.
Good for him.
My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss
in my book, Earth in the Balance...
And the much more popular Harry
Potter and the Balance of Earth...
We need to defend our planet against
pollution, as well as dark wizards.
Sure, blame the wizards.
That's why I'm offering
a bag of moon sapphires...
To the first scientist who can
solve this problem once and for all.
Ah... . Ooh... .
Lovely, aren't they?
Sapphires?
With those, I could
open the gate of Girash.
First up is Professor Ogden Wornstrum.
Wornstrum!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have placed in orbit a giant mirror...
That will reflect 40 percent of the
sun's rays, thus cooling Earth. Observe.
Problem solved.
That's a little bright.
All right. What else we got?
Professor, you're a professor.
You must have some ideas.
Absolutely not! I won't speak.
I've got nothing to hide.
Our next speaker is Professor--
I demand the floor!
Yes, it's your turn to speak.
Well, nuts to me. I'm taking the stage.
I know the source of
the greenhouse gases...
But in my shame, I've kept
it secret for 75 long years.
Oh, it haunts my memory still.
Professor, no! Don't do it!
Don't do what?
Don't use this memory ray so I can
remember what happened back then?
It was October 17 at 1:54 p.M.
And 14 birds were flying by the window.
I was working at Mom's
Friendly Robot Company.
Back then, robots were slow-Moving,
stiff and a little on the uptight side.
Oh, dear, might I favor master
with a tender kiss on the forehead?
Oh, I've failed again.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
The company's owner pressured
me to create a sportier robot.
Stop!
It wasn 't easy. But by sacrificing
fuel efficiency, I succeeded.
What was that?
A flaming burp.
Does it always do that?
It's not always a burp.
We still have one problem, though.
This robot would never
meet emission standards.
Crap spackle!
We'll just call it a sport utility
robot and classify it as a light truck.
Well...
I suppose the environment can
take one more for the team.
What a fool I was!
If only I had made the effort to
develop a cleaner-Burning robot...
But I was tired and in love.
Take me now, you stud.
Oh, this is all my fault!
That's awful, professor.
Especially the making-Out part.
Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.
All modern robots descend from my
original smog-Blasting designs...
And that's the cause
of global warming today.
So the robots are to blame,
as I suspected.
We are left with only one possible
course of action, grim though it be.
I got a good feeling about this.
We must immediately and permanently...
Shut down, dismantle
and destroy all robots!
Wait! Surely there's a better--
The conference is over.
I must go now to help
collect cans on Jupiter.
Peace out, y'all.
Destroy all robots!
Destroy all robots!
Poor Bender.
Be brave, my friend.
Come on. You've got to come
out of your chest sometime.
Would you do it for a Bender snack?
Ah-Ha!
Gotcha!
Let me go!
I don't even want the stupid beer.
Yes! You tried to trick me
into coming out of my chest.
But who has the beer now?
I've got mail.
It's a party, apparently.
Do you like to party?
To boogie down?
Well, I'm throwing an all-Night
beach rager for my robot pals.
It all goes down this Saturday on
the isolated Galápagos lslands...
Where there will be no escape...
From the fun.
All robots must attend!
Strange.
Why would Nixon, an awkward,
uncomfortable man, throw a party?
One of the most social
events imaginable?
It's a trap is why! They're going
to deactivate all the robots.
I don't hear any gasping.
We all figured that out.
Oh... .
Well, I'm off.
We can hide you. We'll pile fruit
on you and claim you're a bowl.
No. I'm going to the party.
I won't let you!
Fry, as you know, there are lots
of things I'm willing to kill for.
Jewels, vengeance,
Father O'Malley's weed whacker.
But at long last, I've found
something I'm willing to die for.
This mindless turtle.
Bender, this world isn't
good enough for you.
Not even close.
Goodbye, everybody.
Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead.
It's booby-Trapped!
Oh, yeah, baby!
Come on. Come on, baby.
Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel
better if I had a drink.
Crummy keg, it's completely tapped--
Oh, you're a robot.
Don't stop.
Ew!
Attention, happening robots.
Who's got what it takes
to party with Nixon?
You fellas enjoy yourselves
for the next two hours...
And be sure not to leave the
island for at least two hours.
I'm going out to pick up some smokes.
Really good smokes.
Two hours.
Okay, headless body of Agnew,
let's blow this joint.
Do you want to dance?
No, I'm not really in the--
You know you want to.
Per your orders, I modified my mirror...
To fire a colossal electromagnetic
pulse at the Galápagos.
Every robot will be instantly
and painfully terminated.
Now, for your part of the bargain.
Very well.
Agnew, you belong to Wornstrum now.
I'll say goodbye now.
There ain't no turtles
where Daddy's going.
Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's
about to shut all the robots off and--
What?
We're gonna die!
We're going to the great beyond.
Nixon's not bringing the smokes.
Shut up and pay attention to me.
Bender.
Look, I love life and its
pleasures as much as anyone here.
Except perhaps you, Hedonism Bot.
But we need to be shut off!
Especially you, Hedonism Bot.
I apologize for nothing.
We pollute too much!
We're destroying the world
and killing the turtles!
To hell with the turtles!
No one insults the turtles!
Come on, you!
Let the games begin.
Everyone listen!
Ah! Damn!
I've devised a way to save you and
stop global warming at the same time.
Granted, you're all blasting
out greenhouse gases.
You're one to talk.
But we can use those very
gases to save the planet.
If you all vent your exhausts
directly upward in one burst...
It should thrust the Earth further
from the sun, thus cooling it.
By my calculations, we'll need
the full force of every last robot.
So quickly, everyone point your
exhaust vents straight upward.
Now vent.
Vent like the wind!
Harder! Harder!
Why isn't this working?
Some lazy or polite
robot is holding it in.
Help! Help!
A billion robot lives are
about to be extinguished.
Oh, the Jedis are
going to feel this one.
I'm sorry, buddy.
At least we'll die on
our backs, helpless.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, are you trying to make me look bad?
Ah-Ha! I'm even greater
than I thought I was.
And now to fulfill my destiny!
Fire!
What the--?
We missed!
Professor, for saving the
Earth and foiling me...
I proudly, yet angrily, present
you with Earth's new highest honor:
The Polluting Medal of Pollution.
Thank you. I deserve this.
Hey, professor?
Now that the Earth's orbit...
Is further from the sun,
won't that make the year longer?
Why, yes.
One week longer to be exact.
In that case, I hereby
declare it Robot Party Week!
All right, baby!
Futurama [5x02] - Jurassic Bark - CiWaN
For my next trick,
notice I have nothing up my sleeves...
And nothing in my head.
So if my lovely assistant
will kindly supply me...
With an ordinary,
non-Fake pitcher of milk.
Behold! The milk has vanished!
Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!
Amazing! That's why they call
you Bender the Magnificent.
No, it isn't.
They discovered an intact 20th-Century
pizzeria, like the one I used to work at!
Interesting. No, wait, the other thing.
Tedious.
Let's check it out. You can see
how I lived before I met you.
You lived before you met me?
Sure. Lots of people did.
Really.
Truly, they were as gods
who built this place.
Next, we come to the splendidly
preserved wooden pizza paddle.
Scientists theorize it was used to
gently discipline the delivery boy.
Wait a second. This is Panucci's!
I used to work in this exact pizzeria.
And for your information, lady, this
was not just used to paddle my butt.
It was also used to move
pizzas and crush rats.
I don't know where you
get your facts, sir...
But I am a volunteer housewife
with 45 minutes of orientation...
And a Harlequin romance
about archeologists.
Don't wave your fancy degrees at me.
I recognize all this stuff.
Petrified sausages, old Mr. Vitelli,
and that's--
Yes?
Pizza delivery for Mr. Seymour Asses?
There's no one by that
name here or anywhere.
I hope that in time you'll
realize what an idiot you've been.
I wouldn't count on that.
Poor little guy. You look like
you haven't eaten in a month.
Here. But if Mr. Panucci asks,
your name is Seymour Asses.
I like you, Seymour.
You're not constantly judging me,
like all the other dogs.
Are you?
We understand each other.
People think you're just
a mutt who smells bad...
Can't find a girlfriend
and has a crummy job.
But you're keeping it real
and you call no man "Mister. "
Well, goodbye.
Live long and prosper.
That's the least appetizing
calzone I've ever seen.
No! That's my dog in there!
It's an outrage, I say.
Ow! Ow!
I'm taking him home and I'd like
to see anyone try and stop me.
Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh! Ah!
And then he was ejected by the guards.
Needless to say, I was mortified.
Well, it's not right to
make my dead pet an exhibit.
That's like digging up Lassie
and putting her in the Louvre.
Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
I know. I was deliberately
describing a similar situation.
Why don't you try protesting,
like those native Martians.
Always whining that people don't treat
their ancestors' bones with respect.
Protesting never works.
You're right. I'll give it a shot!
What do you want?
Fry's dog!
When do you want it?
Fry's dog!
Yeah!
I will now perform my
people's native dance.
It says here that this
part of The Hustle...
Implores the gods to grant a favor,
usually a Trans Am.
Thattaboy, Seymour.
Right here waiting for me as always.
Just like that huge
mushroom in my shower.
Hey, there's our little mascot.
You been swimming in the sewer again?
You rascal.
Fry, cleanup!
Seymour, cleanup!
Good dog.
That's a good Seymour.
There's dog fur on my slice!
No, that's vermicelli.
No fur in here.
He's so cute.
He can do two things at
one time: eat and swim.
Three things!
Fry, it's been three days.
You can't keep boogying like this.
You'll come down with
a fever of some sort.
I'm Dr. Ben Beeler, the paleontologist
who discovered your dog.
Or as some call it,
the Beelersaurus.
So do I get Seymour back?
Are you caving to political pressure?
No. We're sorry,
but there's just too much...
That fossil can teach us
about dogs from your time.
His name was Seymour.
He was once intimate with the
leg of a wandering saxophonist.
He had wet dog smell, even when dry.
And he was not above
chasing the number 29 bus.
The 29? Lnteresting.
That's all I needed, right?
I'm good.
Okay, then. Here's your dog back.
Seymour!
Lady and gentleman...
How about a hand for my
temporary replacement assistant?
I was all in this part! It's magic!
You're not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
Stop!
Good news, everyone!
Hurray, he's back!
And he's looking for a garbage can to
put the rock in. Here you go, buddy.
No. Actually, we've discovered that
Fry's dog was fast-Fossilized...
Preserving its cellular structure.
Which means we can clone it!
Seymour will live again!
A little land mammal.
Can you believe it, Bender?
I'm gonna have my best friend back!
Why the idiot convention?
Cubert, my precious babe.
I'm going to attempt
to clone Fry's dog...
Using the very same
apparatus I used to clone you.
Look! There's a smidge
of toe still in here.
You see, beneath the fossil's
crunchy mineral shell...
There's still a creamy
core of dog nougat.
So will Seymour remember how
to sing "Walking on Sunshine"?
Amazingly, yes.
In cases of rapid fossilization,
I can press this brain scan button...
Retrieving Seymour's memories at
the precise instant of doggy death.
I'm gonna get my puppy back!
Ln your face, Grim Reaper!
Crappy, ineffective reaper.
I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat
from human mode to dog mode.
The dog says:
Oh-Oh. This may take a while.
You stink, loser!
Hey, Fry, pizza going out.
Come on!
But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.
Like you got squat to celebrate.
You're a delivery boy this millennium...
And you'll be a delivery
boy next millennium.
What's with Seymour?
It's like he don't want you to go.
Or he thinks your pants is too short.
Which is crazy, because frankly,
you look fabulous. Now get going!
I won't be gone long, Seymour.
Just wait here till I come back.
Hello? Pizza delivery for...
 "I.C. Wiener"? Oh, crud.
Here's to another lousy millennium.
Five, four, three, two .
What the--?
A dog collar, for me?
You shouldn't have.
That's for Seymour.
Oh.
A subscription to the Daily Growl?
That's not a reputable
journal of opinion.
That's for Seymour. I'm getting
everything ready for when he's cloned.
Are you on the junk, Fry?
Why waste time on a creature
of inferior intelligence?
Hey, he was smart. He could fetch.
I can fetch!
He could dig up bones.
Hello? Charlemagne?
Plus, I bet he couldn't create
a laser show with his head.
Look, Bender,
this has nothing to do with you.
That's impossible!
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
No one ever asked if Bender would
like to live in a tiny little house.
Not that I would.
A tiny little house
that says "Bender" on it.
Ow!
This is Fry. If you're calling
about the used towels for sale...
They're still available for $45 each.
Phil, it's your father.
Where are you?
You're holding up New Year's brunch.
Your brother can't wait any longer.
Hello, first bologna
of the new millennium.
Here he comes.
That's him and Seymour.
Well, that's weird.
Seymour's here, but--
Go! Go! Touchdown!
But where's Philip?
I'm telling you,
the Y2K computers got him.
We'll face burning
roads, rivers exploding...
Calculators transformed
into Scud missiles.
There's nothing we can do.
What's that, Seymour?
You walking on sunshine?
He's trying to tell us something.
Maybe he can lead us to Philip!
Should we follow him?
To our deaths? Negatory.
It's the Y2K trying to
lure us into an ambush.
And I ain't buying it.
Pass the bologna.
Are you gonna be done soon?
Sorry, but we need to
practice hand-To-Hand combat...
In case an enemy knocks the
laser guns out of our hands...
And they slide way across the room.
Could you do it someplace else?
I'm setting up Seymour's dog bed.
Okay.
Ow!
Heel, boy! Heel!
Oh, hello, Fry.
I guess I didn't notice you there.
I'm having such fun with my
new best friend, Robo-Puppy.
That's nice.
I was just out walking him.
Yes, you can walk him.
Of course, after he goes,
you have to refill the canisters.
Come here, boy! Pet, pet, pet.
Robo-Puppy receiving petting.
Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy?
That's so adorable!
Jealous? Not when I have
the love of Robo-Puppy here.
Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.
Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek.
Robo-Puppy commencing cheek licking.
Licking in progress.
Licking complete.
Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend.
There. Perfect.
Good news, everyone!
The Clone-O-Mat is ready!
Finally!
Robo-Puppy commencing
two-Hour yipping session.
Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
Behold once more,
the mighty Clone-O-Mat!
Requiring such vast
amounts of electricity...
That we must harness the
elemental power of nature itself!
Wow.
I speak, of course, of molten
lava deep within the Earth's core.
To the subbasement!
Powering up Clone-O-Mat!
Placing fossil on
the Plat-Clone-O-Form.
Initiating dog brain CAT scan!
Come on, boy. Come back to life.
Know ye now what feels
like to be dog god!
Commencing DNA extraction.
Fry, come on!
The talent show.
What? I'm in the middle of something.
But if we don't perform,
in what sense do we have an act?
Bender, enough.
Leave me alone!
So that's how it is?
I thought you were my friend.
But if you love your dog so much,
maybe you'd rather play fetch!
No!
Now I'm all you got!
I hate you! I hate you!
You evil, metal man! Ow!
So anyway, your dog is melted.
Now we're friends again.
Not necessarily.
For the dog may yet survive.
May yet? Really?
Indeed. You see, that fossil
was made of dolomite...
The tough, black mineral that won't
cop out when there's heat all about.
By contrast, observe the
lava's affect on this ice swan.
Of course, that would've
melted even at room temperature.
I just wanted to get rid of it.
But had it been made of that
righteous mineral dolomite...
There's a slim chance
it might have survived.
So Seymour might still exist?
Perhaps, for a few minutes.
It's dolomite, baby!
Then I'm going in after him!
No!
He'd come after me!
Acting like a moron
won't bring your dog back.
Then all hope is lost!
Goodbye, Seymour.
Please stop crying, Fry.
Here.
I assumed you were just
pretending to love the dog...
To toy with my emotions.
What have I done?
You didn't do anything.
Don't beat yourself up.
Fry, I'm sorry.
I should have understood how someone
can love an inferior creature...
Because I love you.
Not in the way of the ancient Greeks,
but the way a robot loves a human...
A human loves a dog,
and occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.
I'm going in!
I'm a professor!
Why isn't anyone listening to me?
You can't go in because you'll melt!
The fossil only has a chance
because it's made of dolomite.
I'm 40 percent dolomite!
Oh, it's hot. Oh, it's very hot!
I am one hung-Over cryogenicist.
Throw that mutt in the
freezer till his owners come.
You can't solve all your
problems by freezing them.
I think you're forgetting our motto.
Are you the cryogenicist who
called about our son's dog?
You must be the Frys.
Yeah, he's right over there.
Sorry we're late.
We all got sick from eating bad bologna.
Y2K.
What's he so worked up about?
He's just upset because
our boy's missing.
Come on, you overgrown rat!
Lead us to Philip.
Bender's been down there too long!
I'm going in after him!
Professor! Lava! Hot!
This is all my fault.
I let my best friend risk his
life just to get my dead dog back.
Bender!
And that is why they call me...
Bender the Magnificent!
Hey, where'd everybody go?
Okay, let's clone us some dog.
Yeah!
Very well.
Let this abomination
unto the Lord begin!
Interesting. It seems Seymour
died at the ripe old age of 15.
Fifteen? You mean he lived for
12 more years after I got frozen?
Indeed.
Stop the cloning.
Oh, sure.
Smash the smart guy's machine.
Fry, what's wrong?
Think about it.
Seymour lived a full
life after I was gone.
He probably even added new
songs to his repertoire.
But that's a good thing.
"Walking on Sunshine" sucks noodles.
I had Seymour till he was 3.
That's when I knew him and
that's when I loved him.
I'll never forget him.
But he forgot me a long, long time ago.
Ow!
Futurama [5x03] - The Route Of All Evil - CiWaN
Ah, beer. So many choices.
And it makes so little difference.
How about Lobrau?
It has dots on it.
Overruled! The choice of
champions is Pabst Blue Robot.
I can't drink that. The metal
shavings make my throat bloody.
Baby wants a Zima.
Hey, hey. We can all
fight when we're drunk.
Listen, why don't we
just brew our own beer?
You can brew your own beer?
Sure. The kids at the orphanarium
used to do it all the time.
Cursed bacteria of Liberia! My own son,
suspended from boarding school.
It's not my fault, Dad.
And you, Cubert.
I cloned you from one of my warts,
and I can send you straight back there.
What's going on? Is this angry
yelling, or busted-Hearing-Aid yelling?
I'm afraid it's both.
What?
Now, hold on.
Everyone cool your daiquiris.
Let's give the little vermin
a chance to explain themselves.
It was self-Defense, Mom. Just look
at this letter the principal sent.
We were in science class...
And we had finished building
a miniature black hole.
That was easy.
Pretty scrawny black hole.
It must be hungry.
Black holes don't need food.
Neither do nerds.
My Manwich!
That's it. You've compressed
our lunches to a singularity...
For the last time. Salt him, Dwight.
When I re-Solidify, I'm gonna
put you in a world of goop.
See? That bully started it.
We couldn't fight back with brawn...
So we used our brains.
I warned you not to use those things!
Let's see. We've got our malt.
Our hops.
We just need a big
disposable tub to mix it in.
Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
Dwight, you remember the crew?
Yeah.
Crew, you remember Cubert?
Yeah.
Wonderful!
Then I'm sure you won't mind...
Being their legal guardians for a month.
Well, well, if it isn't my old friends,
Stretch Pants, No Pants...
And Idiot.
We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
I heard alcohol makes you stupid.
No, I'm... Doesn't.
Actually, Dwight, you're right.
Alcohol is very, very bad. For children.
But once you turn 21...
It becomes very, very good.
So scram.
Oh, man.
I'm sick of this.
Hey, Dad. What useless contraption
are you half-Baking today?
You what?
Oh, this is my latest invention.
A device that lets anyone
sound exactly like me.
Good news, everyone.
I'm a horse's butt.
I am? That's not good
news at all, you little...
What's this device's marketability?
Who's the target consumer?
There is no target consumer.
Only targets.
Targets that will tremble in fear
as their new masters hand down edicts
In my glorious, booming voice!
Now quit pestering me,
you confounded scoundrels!
Can I collate that?
No.
Can I shred these contracts?
No!
Wow! A power stamper.
Now look at all the work I gotta do!
The ingredients are cooked.
They picked up some of your
natural robot flavorings.
Time to add the yeast.
Yeast? You mean I'll have a
life form growing inside me?
It's so beautiful.
<i>Talk to me.
This is Professor Farnsworth.</i>
<i>I have an important delivery
for you and your dumb crew.</i>
<i>You must deliver a pizza to Dog Doo 8...</i>
<i>A planet at the edge of the universe.</i>
Sorry I can't come to say goodbye,
but I'm busy inventing useless junk.
And I smell bad.
If you were my kids, you'd get
quite a talking to. From your father.
When he got home from the Senate.
Oh, bother.
What have they done now?
Those pork dumplings sent
us on a fake pizza delivery.
The address was on Dog Doo 8.
But the universe ends
right after Dog Doo 7.
Child-Man, is this true?
Yeah. But why are you mad at us?
Your dummy brigade wasted a week
on an obviously fake mission.
Plus, they're making bootleg
beer inside company property.
Lies! Lies and slander!
Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed?
That's the last straw!
You boys have been
underfoot long enough.
You jerked the words
right out of my mouth.
We're their fathers,
and it's high times we acted like it.
Here comes violence.
Get a job, you lazy kids.
I guess if you want children beaten,
you have to do it yourself.
Come on, Dad. Shuffle faster!
You don't wanna miss the
unveiling of our company.
Company?
Cute. What'll you peddle? Lemonade?
Shoeshines? Cootie insurance?
Perhaps they've constructed
a teddy bear hospital.
Actually, we're starting a
competing delivery company.
Welcome to the world of business.
Who's going to use a delivery
service with a kicked sign?
Nobody, that's who.
We already have a client signed up.
<i>We're delivering the Daily Supernova.</i>
So your delivery company is just
a cute, harmless paper route.
No. It's a serious business.
Yes. It's a tremendous
responsibility, all right.
What if a paper were
to land in a puddle?
Civilization as we know
it might get splashed.
Why do they always
treat us like dumb kids?
We're practically old enough to
find the Fox Network infantile.
We'll show them.
All Awesome Express needs...
Is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft.
Voil?!
You got a quarter?
Man! The ad said to allow four
to six seconds for delivery.
More like seven.
I'm really starting to swell up
with beer. I must look ridiculous.
No. You have a healthy glow.
Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment.
Let me feel.
Have you thought about a name?
I was thinking Benderbrau
if it's an ale...
Botwiser if it's a lager.
I hope it's a lager.
I can take it to a ball game.
I felt that one!
There's a crack in the hull here.
That could cause
explosive decompression.
Put a sticker on it.
Off on your first delivery?
You be careful, my little tinkler.
Remember we used to call
you that, huh? Tinkler.
Gets moving. Those newspapers
won't deliver themselves.
Only the Sunday edition can do's that.
Goodness, there must be
50 papers in that bundle.
That's a big number, 50.
Yeah. If you're an idiot.
Three, two, one.
All systems go.
Blastoff!
See you at din-Din.
I'm blowing you a kiss.
Take evasive action!
It's closing in. You can't avoid it.
It's a cheek-Seeker.
And...
Got you!
No!
Business is down, so I filed papers
to have you all reclassified as slaves.
Well, well, if it isn't
our little munchkin moguls.
What's the trouble, men?
Need some penny rolls for your profits?
Actually, thanks to Dwight's
brilliant accounting...
And my unaccountable brilliance...
Our paper route now has
over a million customers!
We're finally making
more money than you guys.
Aren't you impressed now, Pops?
Aren't you? Aren't you?
In a small way, yes.
You still don't have your own
building or conference table...
Or one of those things.
Hello.
Our dads are never impressed,
no matter what we do.
Maybe we should start a fire.
If we really want to impress them,
we'll have to crush them with strategy.
Dwight Lightning.
Very well.
But I get to name the next strategy.
<i>This week on The Real World The Sun:</i>
<i>I'm burning to death!</i>
You know how much an apartment
that big would cost on the sun?
People! As you know, our young
sons have become great successes...
In the very same field as us.
Oh, that's great!
That's good.
Naturally, we're humiliated.
That's why we need you,
our loyal crew...
To make Planet Express
800% more profitable.
We'll start by slashing salaries.
And this time, I mean really slashing.
Guys? I don't know
how to tell you this...
So I'll just let Fry
blurt it out thoughtlessly.
We don't work for you anymore!
What?
Dwight and Cubert made us an offer.
We're paperboys now.
Incoming!
We've got papers to stuff, team.
Hut-Two. Hut-Two.
Yes, sir.
We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth.
Folks? The situation is grim.
But we shall prevail, thanks to you,
our crack team of loyal dregs.
I don't even know who this guy is.
I'm Scruffy, the janitor.
Of course you are.
Now, we've got to buckle down...
And save Planet Express.
I'm on break.
Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of
activity, but we have an announcement.
I direct your attention to the forms
which I'm presently engaged in handing you.
Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg!
They've taken over our company.
Balderdash! I never agreed to that.
No. But you did declare yourself
dead three years ago as a tax dodge.
Tax dodge, nothing! You take
one nap in a ditch at the park...
And they start declaring
you this and that.
Either way, I technically inherit
your building and your spaceship.
Which means Planet Express is now...
Awesome Express.
You rotten kids!
Will you be hiring?
No.
You rotten kids!
There. One million papers,
folded and loaded.
Leela, help me apply these
flame decals I got in my cereal.
They'll make the ship go faster.
And what's your scientific
basis for thinking that?
I'm 12.
Did I ever tell you how
I used to own that ship?
There but for the grace of God.
Oh, my God! I think it's time!
Hurry, Leela!
Get some coasters and cold mugs.
Push, Bender! Push!
You're doing great.
Oh, it feels like it's trying
to push a waterbed out of me.
Almost there. Just two more bottles.
Is it okay? I can't hear anything.
It's an ale. Five gallons, six ounces.
Hey, what's going on?
This is a delivery company,
not a delivery room.
We busted our buns
delivering a million papers...
And this is how you greet us?
With a bunch of frosty cold beers?
Hey, wait a second. How did you
deliver a million papers in one hour?
We just did, okay?
'Cause we're awesome.
Yeah. Awesome.
Yeah. Awesome.
Hello, Awesome Express, the rude,
crude delivery dudes.
How may I direct your call?
What's that?
You haven't gotten your paper?
In how long?
Might a homeless old man have
a touch more beef bourguignon...
And another tequila slammer?
Please?
Don't you sweet-Talk me...
You wrinkly old tube sock.
May I have one too, wife?
You're both pathetic,
being jealous of your own offspring.
Now, you should be happy
that they became successes...
Instead of following
in your food stamps.
Oh, it's true.
But they grow up so fast.
We wanted a few more years
of being better than them.
They're so stinking talented,
they don't even need their fathers anymore.
Dad! We screwed up.
You did? Tough luck, suckers.
Help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver
way more papers than we could handle.
We couldn't handle them. We dumped
the extras in a crater on the moon.
Now everybody's yelling at
us about their missing papers.
And we don't know what to do!
Why did you boys do all this?
We wanted you to be proud of us.
Proud of you?
You ruined us with sleazy
business practices...
And a complete disregard
for human decency.
Of course we're proud of you.
Damn right, we are!
Now, come on, let's go do a little
father-Son weaseling out of this.
Good thing I had this net
installed for catching giraffes.
Okay, boys. Let me show
you how a paper man does it.
<i>Au revoir!</i>
Can I use the gun, Dad?
What kind of father
would I be if I said no?
Only one house to go.
We did it!
Run away!
That bully, Brett Blob, lives there.
He's ugly, mean, stupid, stink mucus!
And last week, we sort
of broke his window.
All right, all right. What do we
do when we break somebody's window?
Pay for it?
Oh, heavens, no!
We apologize with nice, cheap words.
I thought I heard the doorbell.
But I see it was the "dork bell."
You made a funny good one, Brett.
Now, now, no need to
give us the business.
We'd like a word with your daddy.
Whatever. Dad!
Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father
is a perfectly normal, reasonable man.
What do you want?
Mr. Blob, our sons have come to
apologize for damaging your window.
They've learned their lesson,
and they want to make amends.
Sorry, sir.
Yeah, sorry.
You shove your apology into the bottom
of your one-Way digestive system.
Now, see here. We assured our sons
that you'd accept their apology.
Tell you what. I'll accept their
apology when they kiss my ass!
Which I don't have.
No one gives my boy that option.
Bring it on, Jell-O pop.
Yeah, get him, Dad.
Show him who's boss.
Get him, Pops.
Right.
That was incredible!
You are the bravest dads
in the entire trauma center.
You guys almost had him,
until he digested you.
Oh, you're good kids.
If I could feel anything
right now, it would be pride.
I was wrong! I can still feel pain!
He's come to finish the job.
Someone toss me out the window!
No, no wait. I feel terrible
about what happened.
I've just been under a lot of stress
lately down at the plant, you know?
They're bringing in computers
to improve productivity...
And, well, that's no
excuse for how I acted.
But the boy needs to see that real men
solve their disagreements with words...
Not violence.
So if you'll accept my apology...
Well, I hope we can put this
embarrassing incident behind us.
I suppose.
Hey, chumps. I heard you were
on the ass end of an ass-Kicking.
I figured you could use a few of these.
Why not? Might as well live it up
as long as I got this catheter in me.
Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?
Sounds like a plan.
This is what makes
life worth clinging to.
Three fathers enjoying a
day out with their sons.
It would seem we've taught
our boys a lesson about life.
Man or blob, it's what's
inside that counts.
Futurama [5x04] - A Taste Of Freedom - CiWaN
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
There's no denying it.
The future's crazy.
Oh, well, don't want to stand out.
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
There's nothing crazy about it.
It's just Freedom Day!
So, what is Freedom Day?
Sounds like a feminine hygiene product.
No, it's a fabulous, crab-Ulous day!
If you want to do something, you do it,
and just spleck with the consequences.
You know, like how I live every day.
Happy Freedom Day!
Oh, I think my wrist is broken.
Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day
without the traditional Freedom Tub!
Ooh.
Mm. That'll feel nice
on my shattered bones.
Wow, nude hot-Tubbing?
That's all I need to
hear about Freedom Day.
Then consider the
following lecture a bonus.
On Earth, freedom is a given. But on
my planet, we have to suffer for it.
Sure, you can be a comedian
instead of a doctor...
If you want your parents to
roll over in their graves!
Sure, you can vote for Skanadel,
if you want there should be a recession!
Sure, you can go to medical school...
If you've given up on your
dream of being a comedian!
That's why I love Earth.
You can do what you want,
and no one makes you feel guilty...
Because no one cares.
We're not listening!
That's what I'm talking about!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Excuse me, coming through. Freedom
train arriving on track one. Ooh, ooh!
Ow! You broke my foot!
Freedom.
What's this next float, Linda?
Representing our men, women
and children in uniform...
It's Earth's greatest
space hero, Zapp Brannigan.
Happy Freedom Day, ladies!
Come on, let loose
and show me something.
Anything.
Seriously, I'd take an armpit.
Oh, yeah, thank you, Linda!
You're welcome!
Okay, Morbo, now it's your turn.
If that is your Freedom Day wish .
Thank you, secretary of transportation.
My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so
much freedom, it's almost sickening.
We're free to choose which hand our
sex-Monitoring chip is implanted in.
If we don't want to pay our taxes...
Why, we're free to spend a
weekend with the Pain Monster.
See you April 15, folks!
Cue the fireworks guy!
Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day
celebration is brought to you by:
Shankman's Rubbing Compound.
When something needs rubbing,
think Shankman.
Yay, Shankman!
It costs more, but it's worth it.
Our planet has been through
so much this past year.
Wars, droughts, impeachments.
But we've never lost our sense
of what's truly important:
The great taste of Charleston Chew.
And now, let us salute that
beloved symbol of freedom...
Our flag, Ol' Freebie.
I'm swelling with patriotic mucus.
In our darkest hour, we can stand
erect with proud, up-Thrust bosoms.
Anyone who laughs is a Communist.
Knowing that, with a
shifty glance skyward...
We will see by the rocket's red glare,
that our flag is still there.
It's gone!
Yes, fellow patriots! I ate your flag!
And I did it with pride.
For to express oneself by doing a thing,
is the very essence of Freedom Day!
Bless this planet and
all its wonderful people!
Kill him! Kill the traitor!
Hey! It's the guy that
desecrated our flag!
Stop that red menace!
I'm all scuttled out! What?
My planet's embassy?
They're paid to not kill me!
Alley-Oop!
I thought I understood this world.
I thought I was fitting in.
But I guess I don't belong here any
more than I do on our crappy home planet.
Sorry.
What sorry?
Our planet stinks. We all know it.
Enough with the persecution, I'm saying.
Zoidberg, as ambassador, I promise
you the full support of our government.
Poor boy. You want
maybe a nice mug cocoa?
Ambassador Mervin,
you and your staff are so kind.
I'm truly humbled.
What, no marshmallows?
Well, let's storm the place!
Without my prior knowledge.
Coming through!
Freedom Train! Step aside.
You, too, fatso. Freedom!
Cool your jowls, Nixon.
You may not like it that
Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag.
You may even find the image of it
festering in his bowels offensive.
But the right to freedom of expression
is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution.
Argh-Ooh. Maybe so.
But I know a place where the
Constitution doesn't mean squat!
The Supreme Court hereby accepts
the case of Earth v. Zoidberg.
Sock it to him!
Two, four, six, eight.
Eating the flag is bad!
Now, your noose knot
has exactly seven twists.
<i>You can eat my dog...
You can eat my truck...</i>
<i>But you eat my flag...
And you're out of luck...</i>
<i>She's waving proud around the world...
From Dallas to Fort Worth...</i>
<i>Let me say it again...
Don't mess with Earth...</i>
They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
Posers!
I was hating Zoidberg
before it was cool.
Where are we gonna find
a lawyer to take his case?
I'll ask the head of the ACLU.
Once he's done singing.
Don 't mess with Earth...
Kill Zoidberg! Good night!
Howdy, there.
I'm a lawyer, and I'd like to help
your friend out of this pickle.
Who are you, old man?
Name's Old Man Waterfall...
But most folks just call me Old Man.
I'll never remember that.
I'm a veteran of three dozen wars.
Name a body part and a planet,
and I've taken a bullet in it, on it.
All to keep our flag flying free.
And you want to defend Zoidberg?
Are you familiar with the old
robot saying, "Does not compute"?
Son, to me a robot's just a garbage
can with sparks coming out it.
The sparks keep me warm.
I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did...
But I'll fight tooth and
nail for his freedom to do it.
Or I would, if I hadn't lost my teeth and
nails on Mars and Saturn, respectively.
Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!
You okay there in the embassy, Zoidberg?
No! There's no cocoa marshmallows!
And every night, the rats
eat a little more of my foot.
Oyez, oyez, oyez!
All rise for the Honorable Chief Justice
Myrtle Foo and the associate justices!
Counsel, you may address the
court on behalf of Earth, if ready.
I was hatched ready.
Honorable judge heads,
yonder crawdad done ate up our flag.
I was doing freedom of speech,
Earth's most sacred right.
Your Honor, freedom of speech applies
to what comes out of a mouth...
Not what goes in.
Can counsel cite precedent?
Yes, darling, I can.
In State of Alabama vs.
Giant Space lguana...
Chewing the corners
off the Constitution...
Was deemed nonprotected speech.
He shut you up, O'Connor.
Mr. Waterfall, you may present
arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg.
Oh, God, I'm nervous.
Two of my three hearts
are having attacks.
Court's kind of fun when
it's not my ass on the line.
Nachos?
Oh, land-O-Goshen.
Your Honors, I'm not some slick
big-City lawyer like my opponent here.
But I am a veteran who
has fought for his planet.
You see this hand of mine?
Yes, I do.
No, you don't!
Because I lost my real hand planting the
flag when we took back Halley's comet.
Yet it was worth it.
So much do I love that flag.
I love it even more than
I love my seven wives.
That's right, I'm a polygamist.
Boo!
Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself...
Had I not used my intestine as a rope
to hoist a flag made of my own skin...
If it would protect the freedoms of
the proud people who salute that flag.
Freedom such as polygamy.
Boo!
I rest my case.
Whoa, jeez.
The justices and I will now confer,
using high-Speed telepathy.
By a vote of six to three...
We find that flag-Eating is not
protected by the Constitution.
Six to three? I beat the spread!
The court orders an
immediate public apology.
Apology accepted.
Just don't let it happen again.
She means you, you turkey of the sea.
Me, apologize? Never!
I came to this planet to
learn the meaning of freedom!
But I say it's you who
should get a nice lesson.
So do your worst...
Because no punishment could be
bigger than denying me my freedom!
You are hereby sentenced to death.
Wait, let me finish.
Also, in a rare double-Whammy decision,
the court finds polygamy constitutional.
Boo!
I can't wait to tell my husband!
Boo!
Remember, men, take him alive so
there's something left to kill.
Stay back!
This embassy is sovereign mud
of the mud planet Decapodian!
Invading these mud
premises is an act of war!
Yeah? Well, what are you
gonna do about it, shrimpy?
You wanna see, Mr. Bigshot?
Attack Earth!
Yes, I know it's a schlep. Just do it!
Aha! Now the rubber
band's on the other claw!
Ready? Retreat!
Deny my freedom, will you?
Well, we'll do to you what we did to
the Squash men of the Squash planet:
Squished them!
Charleston Chew?
You bet!
All right, Kif.
Let's show these freaks...
What a bloated,
runaway military budget can do.
Bring me the codes for
our global-Defense network.
Aye, aye, sir.
Commence lip identification scan.
No tongue.
We can't be too careful
with these codes.
Rumor has it a double agent
may be aboard this very ship.
I'm watching you.
You, ensign, what's your name?
Hugh Man, sir!
Hugh Man.
Now, that's a name I can trust.
Run down to the central battle
computer and enter these codes.
Sir, there's something
about that ensign that's--
You're damn right there is.
That young lad's gunning for your job.
And he just might get it.
The enemy approacheth.
Lieutenant, fire missile one and
recommend me for another medal.
Make it gaudy. I'm going clubbing later.
Ticktock.
Sir, all planetary
defenses have been disabled.
Perhaps the Decapodians acquired
our secret codes somehow.
Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame.
Steady, steady .
Now!
Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love
freedom, and then enslave all of Earth?
Your planet doesn't deserve freedom...
Until it learns what it is to not
have freedom. It's a lesson, I say!
Ow!
What the hell is this
dirt pile we're building?
None of your beeswax, slave.
You'll find out soon enough.
Just focus on globbing that mud.
Glob!
I'm no good at being a slave.
I'm thinking about graduate
school to become a barber.
This can't go on.
Today is the day we fight back!
It's already 10:00.
Oh, you're right.
Tomorrow is the day we fight back.
Yeah, well, good luck, sister.
All our modern technology is useless.
I know I am.
Hey, wait.
I'm having one of those things.
You know, a headache with pictures.
An idea?
Mm. Mm-Mm-Mm.
Back in my day, we didn't have
your fancy all-Digital weapons.
We still managed to kill
each other just fine.
The crossbow.
A pitiless, elegant killing machine.
The Bender of the 15th century!
Not big enough. We need something
that can take out an entire army.
Something you could
commit a war crime with--
Wow!
Ow.
Earth slaves,
behold the fruit of your labors:
The mobile oppression palace!
Neat!
I don't need to tell you that
occupation forces are expensive.
But with the mobile oppression palace...
A few dignitaries can oppress your
entire planet for pennies a day!
Warships, dismissed!
Do your worst, you sea devils!
I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie!
You can crush me,
but you can't crush my spirit!
Oh, my spirit!
Great-Grandpa, no!
Another victim of the
mano-Centric male-Ocracy.
Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer!
You're welcome.
He defended my freedom
when no one else would.
He was a good and honorable man.
I request a satanic funeral.
Boo!
Is it possible that all this
slavery and oppression...
Is schmutzing up our freedom lesson?
Take a pill, Zoidberg.
Begin again with the crushing!
You haven't won yet, Mervin!
You didn't expect us to
even go to a museum...
Much less steal this
ancient heat-Seeking missile!
I don't even know you.
Oh, it's gonna make such a mess!
This is your secret plan?
Heat-Seeking missiles are useless
against a mobile oppression palace.
All Decapodian technology
is cold-Blooded, like us!
All eyes on Zoidberg!
Ew.
Hey, I need that to smoke!
Zoidberg, how could you?
I used to think you were cool.
Wait, people of Earth, listen!
Yes, I'm desecrating a flag, but to
preserve the freedom it represents.
Zoidberg, you set us free!
I feel like I could stand to hug you!
I can't, but you know
what I'm trying to say.
Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!
If only they appreciated freedom
this much on my home planet.
Wait a second. They do!
Because this is my home planet!
And now, to raise this
beautiful new flag...
A red lobster that won't ruin
your dinner, Dr. John Zoidberg!
You're a nice man, Nixon.
How's about you take a bite of
the flag for tomorrow's papers?
Oh, I couldn't.
No, no, go ahead. You've earned it.
Well, maybe just a taste.
Now, that's a grand old flag!
All right, Zoidberg!
I wonder what the Shroud
of Turin tastes like.
All right!
Freedom!
Futurama [5x05] - Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch - CiWaN
Whoo-Hoo! Yeah!
Whoa! Ow!
Schman! The great rad spot is
mega-Sweet for party boarding.
Indeed.
Any calls while I was out?
Yeah. You got a telesonic transmission
from Kif a couple hours ago.
My Kify called?
Kif?
Oh, Amy, you're back.
Another hour and I would've
thought of hanging up.
Why didn't you leave a message, sweetie?
I've left hundreds of messages
with your answering machine...
But you never seem to get them.
Bender!
It's not my fault if you don't check me.
Messages erased.
Oh, dearest, this long-Distance
relationship is too much to bear.
When even an inch separates us,
I quiver with misery.
So you can imagine how I feel
when it's a billion light years.
Kif, don't cry,
or you'll get a tummy ache.
Lieutenant, some things came off me
and clogged the drain, so if you can--
Oh-Ho. What's this?
Well, well, well. Do my eyes believe me,
or is that my bosomy swan, Leela?
Say again? You're breaking up.
Oh .
Good news, everyone.
You'll be delivering pain medicine
to the hive mind of Nigel 7.
Scruffy's rolling out a large pill.
You're going to Nigel 7?
Kif's on patrol near there.
You could drop me off on the way.
We could, but we won't!
It's a spaceship, damn it,
not a prom limousine!
Ooh! Lf anyone needs me,
I'll be in the angry dome.
This is a very long trip.
So we'll all have to go into
hibernative naptosis to save oxygen.
I don't even breathe oxygen.
Here I come, Kif.
They jumped right out of their pants.
Oh, what now? Activate glass window.
Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual
disturbance in the Force.
Prepare for ship-To-Ship intimacy.
Yes, sir, captain.
How about I help you finish that
dream you were having about me?
Okay. I was just at this part:
Let's try that a little
lower and lots softer.
Imagine you stowing away and
stealing a licensed starship.
Oh, it's so romantic
it gives me the shivers.
I don't care how much trouble I get in.
I needed to feel my lips pressed
against your lip-Less beak.
Oh, Amy, I can't stand having
a whole universe between us.
I've been thinking a lot about this,
and-- Well, would you move in with me?
Here? But, wouldn't it be crowded?
Oh, no, no. It's really twice the size.
You can use the floor
and I'll have the ceiling. See?
Kif, you have so much
creativity and niceness.
But I'm not sure if l--
Hush.
Before you answer, come thither.
This is the Holo-Shed.
It can simulate anything you desire.
And nothing can hurt you,
except when it malfunctions...
And the holograms become real.
Well, that probably
won't happen this time.
I wanted to show you what life
could be like if we were together.
Computer, run program Kif One.
This is so beautiful!
Spirit! Kif, that's the
pony I always wanted...
But my parents said I had
too many ponies already.
Yes. I programmed it in for you.
Four million lines of BASIC.
And if this isn't the life
you want, how about this?
Run program Kif Two.
Oh, Kif.
We could live here at the shore of the
Tranquilibrius Sea, in a time-Share.
And I would pluck the moon from
the sky just to see you smile.
Almost got it.
Seems to be sort of stuck.
I love you!
Run program Kif-Colon-
Slash-Slash-Three!
This isn't bad.
My aunt had a place like this.
Amy, we could live in a bus
station bathroom for all I care.
As long as we're together,
it'll feel like a castle to me.
Kif, I'd love to live with you.
Someday.
But before then, there's still
lots I want to do on my own.
What was that?
Oh, dear.
I fear the Holo-Shed
might be broken again.
Well, as long as we don't
cross paths with Attila the--
Look! Spirit!
And there's Professor Moriarty.
Jack the Ripper!
Evil Lincoln!
Right-O, gents.
It's another simulation gone mad.
So murder and mayhem,
standard procedure.
Real holographic-Simulated
Evil Lincoln is back!
The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again.
The characters turned real!
Damn! The last time that happened,
I got slapped with three paternity suits.
Oh, my God!
Listen up, history's greatest villains.
Get back into the Holo-Shed
before I start blasting.
Stop!
No shoot fire-Stick in space canoe!
Cause explosive decompression!
Spare me your space-Age techno-Babble,
Attila the Hun.
Oh .
Hey!
Kif, hold on!
I totally want to!
Grab on!
Over here!
Please, hold me!
Have a good one.
Oh, man!
Whew.
After all that,
I could use some relaxation.
I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
Well, except for a few broken bones,
some internal hemorrhaging...
And a partially barfed up heart,
everyone appears fine.
Phew.
Oh, and Kif is pregnant.
Oh, joy!
Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant.
Yes, it's great. A great miracle.
And not one of those bogus
everyday miracles, like a sunrise.
Aren't you a male?
Yeah, what's the deal?
Just when I thought I'd figured out you
biological creatures, it's something else!
Let me at him! Get over here, Kif!
You're--
Look, I'm sure we're all a little
unclear on how anyone gets pregnant.
So, Kif, pray explain, and don't spare
the dirty words where appropriate.
Well, it's quite simple really.
When one of my species experiences
deep feelings of love...
We enter a so-Called "receptive state. "
You disgust me. Go on.
At that point, our skin becomes
a semipermeable membrane...
Which allows the passage
of genetic material.
I held Amy's hand, and voilŕ!
Well, okay.
But that better be all there is.
Oh, Amy, you'll be a mother!
What a wondrous affirmation of our love.
And all from the touch of your hand.
Dude, hold up. Remember when
Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
Indeed.
Kif touched everybody there.
Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
Hey, yeah!
I mean, what about that, Kif?
Well, I suppose I might have
gotten pregnant that way.
Or even from a toilet seat.
Though, that's impossible,
since I have a private washroom.
My home away from home.
By the way, Kif, your flush
seems to be set on stun, not kill.
Look, Kif, I probably am the mother.
Although maybe I'm not.
Of course, I hope I am, but just in case
I'm not, maybe we should have a test.
A test! I demand a test!
Even I laughed at me when I built this
alien cross-Species genetic analyzer.
But I guess I showed myself.
Subjects, please enter the chamber.
Now to take a DNA sample.
When I pull this switch, the
materni-Fuge will spin at 10,000 rpm...
Separating out everyone
who isn't the mother--
Father-- Whatever.
Faster! Faster!
Good! Fry's ejection indicates
that he is not the man mama.
Nor is Captain Brannigan.
Oh, thank you, merciful God.
Zoidberg? What the hell
were you doing in there?
That's where I live. I have no home.
Amy? But that means...
Leela must have impregnated me
when she grabbed my ungloved hand.
That explains the poster in hygiene class:
"No glove, no love. "
Wow, this is all so confusing.
Leela, how could you?
Our love has had to endure your
constant hatred, and now this?
Stop testing our love!
Oh, please, captain.
I thank Leela for the DNA she
gave me, but in my species...
The true parent is the one who
inspired the initial feeling of love.
We call that person the "Smizmarr. "
And my Smizmarr is Amy.
So the toilet seat is like
the uncle or something?
Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
That's okay.
At least Kif's baby
shower should be fun.
I better put it on my calendar.
Thursday. Baby shower. Enter.
Might as well plan for my
new life while I'm at it.
Set motherhood mode.
To motherhood.
Zoidberg?
My face was stuck in a pizza.
Mom? Dad? I know this is weird, but--
Yeah, yeah.
We don't care how squishy
alien get pregnant.
All we care is that we have grandchild.
You're very open-Minded, Mrs. Wong.
Hey, you call her "Grandma" now.
Call me Grandma like crazy.
All the time.
Check it out, y'all.
Everyone we invited is here.
Also Zoidberg.
So let's open the gifts.
Yeah!
I can't wait.
We'll start with this one from Bender.
It's my booties from when I was a kid.
Uh, they're already bronzed.
They are bronze.
And this one's from Leela.
Oh, I just love the bow.
I wonder what it is.
Yes, I wonder what we got you.
It's a basket! For picnics?
It means a lot to me.
It's the basket my parents
left me in at the Orphanarium.
You could use it for picnics.
Here, Amy, we get this one for you.
Is it a new party board?
It's a board, all right.
An ironing board.
We had your old party board converted
now that you not be partying anymore.
You trashed my party board?
Damn right. Now you a mom.
The only surfing you'll do is
under a big wave of responsibility.
Oh, this is the happiest
moment of my life.
You all brought such wonderful gifts.
But the greatest gift
Mine!
Is the bond I share
with my Smizmarr, Amy.
For soon, the quivering mass of life
within me will depend upon us both.
Even now, I can sense it feeding,
squirming, searching, questing.
And shortly, it will
rend my loins in twain...
Burst forth and pull us
down, down, down...
Into the deep, dark
waters of commitment.
That's so beautiful.
Yes, it's .
No! I can't do this!
Oh, my God!
Oh, how could Amy leave me?
When will women learn
to take responsibility...
For the children they've helped create?
The quickening! My time is near.
I must return to my home world to
perform the ancient birthing rights.
Let me know how that turns out.
I must now embark on
a perilous journey...
To give birth in precisely the
same swamp in which I was born.
If it's so dangerous,
I'd better go with you.
A gal has to protect her DNA.
No, Leela.
Tradition demands that I make
this journey with my Smizmarr.
And since Amy isn't here,
I must go it alone.
Farewell, for we may never meet again.
My scrapes feel a little better now.
Hey, what's this fat, ugly thing?
A frog? A toad? Or your mama?
It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
I'm back, baby.
Behold.
The sacred ancestral
birthing grounds of my family.
Smells like a jockstrap.
I am the Grand Midwife.
Hi.
I am Kif, of the clan Kroker,
come to bear my young.
Then let the tea of new life
be brewed, as it is writ:
"And both shall lift the jug together. "
Where is your Smizmarr?
She's not with me.
Oh, the sorrow! Oh, the shame!
Sorry, I'm probably just
making you feel worse.
As long as Amy is with me in my heart,
I will have the strength of two.
Apparently Amy hasn't been
working out much lately.
As the tea boils, please join
hands with your beloved Smizmarr.
Oh, right. Sorry, but I've memorized the
ceremony by rote. It mentions her a lot.
I'll try to endure.
Good, 'cause I'm not changing it.
Now turn, ye two, and gaze
deeply into each other's eyes.
What are you looking at?
May the love I sense between you...
At this moment remain with
you both through all your days.
The tea of new life is ready.
Let those whose love created this life
speak each other's names, then drink.
Amy.
Kif!
Amy! Is it you, or have
I gone crazy with loneliness?
Both.
Whoa!
I still don't know if I'm ready for this,
but I do know I love you.
And I want to be here beside you.
Great. Now I lost my place.
I'm starting over!
Oh, no time. It has begun.
Oh, my!
Neat.
You can do it, Kif.
Whoa, Nelly!
Oh, man!
Amy, my love, tell me,
are they making it to the water?
Amy!
Stay away from my babies!
The birthing is complete.
Oh, thank goodness.
I will now take my leave.
I live here, so I won't
actually be going anywhere...
But you don't have
to talk to me anymore.
Congratulations.
Way to go, squishy!
There goes my DNA.
What a disgusting and beautiful process.
That's birth for you.
Well, we've given them
a great start, Amy.
And in 20 years, they'll sprout legs
and crawl back onto land as children.
I'll be ready then.
Futurama [5x06] - Less Than A Hero - CiWaN
Your call is being--
Connected.
By SewerCom.
Reach out and touch the sewers.
Look, Morris! It's Leela calling!
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! Ready for
your big trip to the surface?
We're excited, honey, but we
don 't want to embarrass you.
I mean, your mother and
I are basically monsters.
Dad, relax. You are being so mutant.
I found this adorable little bag to
wear over my head. And it was on sale!
No one's wearing anything adorable
over their head. Now listen.
I could never, ever be ashamed of my
parents. I'll see you this weekend.
Hey, guess who I just got
off the video phone with.
No!
My parents!
They're coming up from the
sewers for a visit Sunday.
Are you off your rocket?
Your parents are mutants.
It's illegal for them
to come above ground...
Because they're inferior genetic scum.
Present company excluded, of course.
I'm getting them a special one-Day
surface permit from city hall.
While you're there, could
you get me a license to kill?
Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
What does piano wire count as?
Good news, anyone.
The Swedish robot from Pi-Kea is here
with the super-Collider I ordered.
Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap.
Let's see what tools we'll need.
Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh.
All right, we're all set.
Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness
of working with one's own hands.
There. Finished.
And only six missing pieces.
Those Swedes know how to put
in almost everything you need.
Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like
I just went 10 rounds with mighty Thor.
I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
I've got just the thing.
Genuine miracle cream...
I bought from a traveling salesman.
"Come one, come all! " He said.
"Step right up! "
"This sounds too good to be true,"
I thought.
He said I looked like a smart young man!
"So is it a deal?" I inquired.
Two hours later, he was
gone with 60 of my dollars!
But I had the miracle cream.
Bad news, nobody.
The super-Collider super exploded!
I need you to take it back and
exchange it for a wobbly CD rack...
And some of those rancid meatballs.
Excuse me. Hi.
Do you have a minute?
I live in Jersey City. My car
broke down, and my aunt's sick.
She needs this medicine, but I need
bus money, so I'm mugging you.
Hand over your wallets!
I don't believe that story for a second.
It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you!
There's no bus to Jersey City.
Give me your wallets now,
or my robot will shoot!
Don't make me hurt you.
I'm too scared to find my pocket.
Here, I'll just take off
my pants and give you those.
Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing!
Give it to him, Andrew!
Give it to him again, Andrew!
What the--? Laser-Proof shirts, huh?
Well, I'll show you!
Hey! Quit it!
Foiled. And after years of planning.
You're out of the gang.
How did we manage to survive?
What gave us those strange powers?
Maybe we're wearing magic rings,
but they're invisible
So we don't even realize it.
Also, you can't feel the rings.
Fry! Shut up and look at this!
"May cause super powers
in humans. "
Wow! A super-Powers drug you
can just rub into your skin?
You'd think you'd have to freebase it.
Let's see, which powers do we have?
"Super strength"?
Yep.
Lickity speed?
Check.
Yes, sir.
<i>Ability to command the
loyalty of sea creatures. </i>
Hey, Zoidberg, get in here!
Screw you!
Ain't got that.
Nope.
Wow! Super powers!
I'll be able to pack my day with
twice as many humdrum activities.
Leela, I think you're
missing the big picture.
When you were a kid,
what was your biggest fantasy?
To have parents.
Whatever.
The correct answer is,
to be a superhero!
We have super powers, and we're
Americans. This is our chance.
Hm. I have been looking for
a way to serve the community...
That incorporates my violence.
Let's do it!
You'll barely regret this.
Hey! A friend of mine said he mugged
you today, and you had super powers!
It's true.
Thanks to this funky-Fresh cream.
Now me and Leela are forming
an awesome crime-Fighting duo!
Wow! Crime fighting! Cool!
You say you're a duo?
Yeah, duos are good.
Of course, sometimes they're
a little short-Handed.
See you.
With two humans, you'd think there'd be
a robot in there to balance things out.
But whatever.
I have these three costumes you could
use, but I guess I'll just throw one away.
We'd love to have you on the team.
But aren't you more on
the supply side of crime?
Plus, the cream won't give you
super powers. You're a robot.
So? I'm already super strong,
and my arms do this:
Also, I got this going:
Listen up, New New York! There's
a new group of superheroes in town!
And we're--
Quiet! It's 4 a.M
And I just fell asleep for
the first time in 30 years!
Sorry!
A new era of justice has begun.
What?
Attention all crooks,
lowlifes and lawbreakers.
Do yourselves a favor and crawl
back into your filthy tenements...
You human cockroaches, or get your
ugly face punched to custard by...
The New Justice Team!
Captain Yesterday!
Clobberella!
And Super King!
The best one of the three!
Yow!
Ta-Da!
Captain Yesterday, I find your
skintight high-Waters incredibly sexy.
Let's get together sometime.
Sure! I'm listed in the phone book,
so once I reveal my real name...
Along with my address and a
copy of my birth certificate--
Are you crazy? We have to keep
our secret identities secret.
From everybody?
Especially from everybody!
Give several reasons why.
For one, superheroes cause
a lot of collateral damage...
And we don't want to get our butts sued.
Or do we? No, I guess not.
Also, if our identities get out,
every crook in the city will be after us.
Or, God forbid, our loved ones.
Super King has no need for loved ones.
How you doing, kid?
There you go.
Two one-Day mutant surface passes.
Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
Mayor here. What's that?
A horrible crime in the works?
Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger?
That's fantastic news!
Because I get to summon
the New Justice Team!
Shh.
They're usually here by now.
Well, so long. Keep in touch.
Wait! Stay and meet the superheroes!
There's three of you and three
of them, so it'll be perfect!
Is this clown on?
Where are those daring crime-Stoppers?
Oh, I completely forgot!
I left my apartment on fire!
As for me, I'm late for my LSATs.
And I can't take life anymore!
Clobberella! Captain Yesterday!
My liege. You're just in time.
We've received a tip that the
Museum of Natural History...
Will be robbed tomorrow
at exactly 9 a.M.
The target: the priceless
Quantum Gemerald.
Who's the perp?
A dangerous villain
known as the Zookeeper...
Who commits crimes aided by a
pack of highly trained animals!
Pack of highly. Got it!
His crew includes a badger with a
troubled past and nothing left to lose.
An elephant who never forgets to kill.
And a seldom-Used crab named Lucky,
a.k.a. Citizen Snips.
You can count on us, Mr. Mayor!
Justice away!
Hold the elevator!
We're in here too.
Leela, how you gonna
meet your folks tomorrow?
We've already scheduled the Zookeeper
for a 9 a.m. foiling at the museum.
Not a problem. I've cleverly
arranged to meet my parents...
Right there at the same museum at 10.
Nine, ten, a big fat hen.
The name's Bender.
I can't believe the Zookeeper is this
late for his own heist. It's just rude!
Total hell! It's 10!
I'm supposed to meet my parents,
and I'm still in my secret costume!
There they are!
How can Leela not be here?
Do you think she forgot?
Relax.
I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.
Yo, freak jobs! Hit the
nearest manhole, pronto-Like!
But we have passes that allow us to
be up here. From the mayor himself.
I don't know.
I never heard of no mayor.
The Zookeeper!
Sorry I'm late. Long story.
Now, everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting
the entire line and stealing the exhibit!
You're not stealing anything!
Nobody hit the deck!
Ah, the superheroes.
Or should I say, super zeros?
That was uncalled for.
Animals, attack!
Please do not feed the animals!
You're going down, my friend!
Down under!
Man boxing a kangaroo
is a peculiar spectacle.
But a kangaroo boxing a robot?
Now I'm afraid you've lost me.
Citizen Snips!
Nice job, Fingers.
I'm scared and confused. I think we
wandered into an off-Broadway play.
No, there are way too many people here.
Later, if anyone asks when I got away,
tell them right now!
Forget it, Zookeeper.
You're going into captivity!
Fool! A quip about putting me behind
bars would have been far more delicious!
Here, catch!
No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!
I got it! I got it!
I don't got it!
You saved the Gemerald!
Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving
that the deadliest animal of all...
Is the Zookeeper.
You can get off me anytime.
Oh, no! My parents are leaving!
I've gotta go change back into street Leela.
It's the New Justice Team!
Thank you, mysterious heroes!
The value of the Gemerald you
saved is slightly greater...
Than the cost of the damage
you caused to this museum!
A net gain for our great city!
It's good that Leela doesn't love us.
She'll be less sad when we die.
Ow.
Mom? Dad? I showed up!
And I got the audio tour for
Treasures of Liberace's Tomb!
Sweetie, it's okay. You don't have
to apologize for standing us up...
On the only visit to the
surface we'll ever have.
I want to tell you why
I didn't show up, but I can't.
Just please believe me that
it was a very good reason.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
Leela, you could never disappoint us.
We're so proud of everything that
you are, and we always will be.
Because you're our baby girl.
Oh, I can't take it!
Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!
Galloping gators!
You're a superhero?
Well, that's wonderful!
But did you have to make
the costume so revealing?
Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero!
We should print up T-Shirts!
And F-Shirts for our friends
with two arms on the same side!
No, listen, it's very important
that you never, ever tell anyone...
Under any circumstance.
What if I've had a few?
Dad, you drink?
No, not even then!
All right. My sucker is sealed.
In fact, I shouldn't even
be wearing this around here.
It was brisk. I dressed in layers.
That's my girl.
So anyway, my daughter's Clobberella.
Leela is Clobberella?
You're pulling me!
Keep it under your sock.
It's a big secret.
That's why I'm only telling you two.
Oh, my God!
That guy's daughter is Clobberella!
But don't tell anyone.
Gotcha!
Greetings, superheroes. Remember me?
I don't remember much, buddy!
And you're no looker.
Professor, isn't it time for your nap?
Yes, damn it!
Zookeeper, how did you
know our real identities?
Let's just say a little bird told me.
Leela told her parents.
Leela's parents blabbed.
Leela? Ls the person that parrot is
mimicking telling the truth by proxy?
Yes. My parents were so hurt,
I couldn't help it.
But I distinctly told
them not to tell anyone.
We are not amused!
And here's something you may
or may not find interesting.
Mom! Dad!
Leela, please forgive us!
Especially your father, who's the one
who told. Thank you very much, Morris!
Are you all right? Has he hurt you?
No, but my allergies are going nuts.
Oh, God!
Every couch and table has
animal fur all over it.
He lets them climb on everything!
All right, Zookeeper,
what do you want?
Why, the Quantum Gemerald, of course.
You must steal it for me by midnight...
Or your parents will be devoured by
piranhas that I have, shall we say...
Persuaded to walk on dry land.
Save us, Leela! I mean, if you
don 't have anything better to do!
We're out of options.
We have to steal the Gemerald.
But should superheroes commit a crime?
Even to save lives?
I need moral guidance! Bender?
The thought of stealing anything
fills Super King with disgust.
But if it must be so, then
let a museum heist be pulled!
Oh, no! Our super-Power
cream is out of itself!
Check inside the cap.
There might be a caked-In gold mine.
El Zilcho.
I'm afraid we're boned.
El Zilcho. Hey, is it too late
to change my superhero name?
Just be cool. Nobody knows
we're super-Powerly challenged.
Man, this costume is so damn heavy.
Hey, Captain Yesterday? Can l, like,
wail on you with this two-By-Four...
And it doesn't hurt you?
Ow! That didn't hurt.
Hi, superheroes. Everything okay?
Big O, little K, my friend.
Just checking if everything's all right.
It's okay, all right.
Okay, then.
Grab it!
Yo! The superheroes have
turned evil! Most uncool!
Get them!
Stay back, or we'll beat the tar
out of you using super powers!
Whoo-Ooah.
So this is your lair?
Of course not!
You think I'd show you my lair?
My lair's a million times nicer than this.
Okay. Take it easy.
Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.
Hawk, fetch!
That seemed unnecessary.
Our transaction is complete.
Come, Solomon, to the lair!
Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry
I got you kidnapped...
By a crazy madman who tried
to feed you to piranhas.
We're just happy to be
involved in your life.
No, no, it's my fault...
For telling you I was a superhero.
That's true.
I just couldn't stand to have
you think I was ashamed of you.
That's sweet, honey.
But it's natural for children to be
a little ashamed of their parents.
Oh, yeah.
Just like it's natural for parents...
To be a little disappointed in
their children. Not that we are.
But you could call a little more often.
Okay.
And would it kill you
to use some mouthwash?
Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on.
Wanna steal some more stuff?
I guess.
As long as you think it's right.
Superheroes away!
Futurama [5x07] - Teenage Mutant Leelas Hurdles
Pazoozoo, you ungrateful gargoyle!
I put you through college,
and this is how you repay me?
Let's get this gargoyle
hunt on the road.
Driving gloves, driving goggles,
driving thong. There!
Maybe I should drive.
You? A woman?
I'm trying to catch a monster,
not find the quickest route to the mall.
Let me just adjust the seat.
My God, he's gonna do it! Everyone,
seat belts to maximum buckling!
Pazoozoo?
Pazoozoo?
Hey, Grandpa!
Move your wrinkly old keister!
Shut up!
For heaven's gate!
This ship can do 99 percent light speed.
Why are we going 35 miles an hour?
Because we're in a hurry, that's why!
Plus, you have the high beams on!
I can't quite read the sign.
Pazoozoo?
Pazoozoo!
Oh, it's 2:30. We can still catch
the early-Bird dinner special.
Aren't we looking for your gargoyle?
My what?
Hello, Mavis. Surprised to
see me back again so soon?
Mavis is dead.
I expect you'll want to see my angry,
crotchety, grandpa discount card?
Sir, this card has expired.
But it's good for a lifetime.
Well, yours expired.
Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong
in your pants, professor.
Well, I can't keep them in my mouth,
they're nuclear-Powered!
Ow! It bit my finger.
No! No! It's tasted human blood!
Mm. Damn good meat.
Professor, we've talked it over,
and everybody thinks you're too old.
We've decided to do the merciful thing,
and have you youth-A-Sized.
Dear God, no!
Relax, professor. Youth-A-Sizing
is a trendy new spa treatment.
It's this season's
shark-Cartilage enema!
But I like being old!
I don't have to talk to my parents,
no one asks me to help move their stuff
I don't need to understand
today's "edgy" TV sitcoms.
Okay, okay. We're not gonna force you
until I finish this sentence. Get him!
Ah! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh-Ooh-Ooh!
My thong!
Hi! I'm Heather,
your personal youth-A-Sizer.
Let's get started with a nice
botulism treatment, shall we?
Go to hell, Heather!
Oh .
In small doses, botulism toxin
tightens and tones the facial muscles...
Instead of killing you in the
most horrible fashion imaginable.
Give me back my floppy face!
Careful with the giblets!
You're still retaining a
lot of grump in these joints.
More pressure.
Ahhh.
Since this is such a serious case of old,
we'll try our strongest treatment:
A soothing, full-Body
bath in searing hot tar.
Sir, it's not necessary
or wise to be naked.
You sound just like
my tennis instructor.
The tar blisters the age
right out of the body...
In what top scientists
suspect is a miracle.
I don't have time for this!
I have to go buy a single piece of
fruit with a coupon and then return it...
Making people wait behind
me while I complain.
He still sounds sort of old,
sort of real old.
Step aside, lady.
Like everything else in life...
Pumping is just a primitive,
degenerate form of bending.
Whoa. Whoa-Oa. Whoa!
Come on, Bender!
Pump harder! Harder!
I'm trying as hard as I can.
Harder, damn you!
Well, that was an utter waste of time.
Professor, it worked!
You look young enough to be my father!
Poodle spit!
Fifty-Three years old?
Oh, now I'll need a fake
ID to rent ultra-Porn.
Cool, professor.
We should go out and celebrate!
Dear Lord! You've all reverted
to your childhood forms!
Hooray!
I'm a teenage heartthrob again.
While I try to restore
our normal ages...
I expect you all to go about your
jobs like responsible professionals.
It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy.
Stop it, Amy!
You stink!
You know you did it!
Quiet! Quiet, I say!
We're here to take my little
stub of a husband home.
Hermes, say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth.
Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth!
Hey! This is my chance to
spend time with my parents too.
But your parents are
gross sewer mutants. Ow!
When I was an orphan...
I wished I could grow
up with my mom and dad.
And now, thanks to being
hurled backwards in time--
That's not what happened!
Shut up and go live with your parents!
It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom!
You and me can bake, and argue about
my hairstyle hiding my pretty face...
And if some kid picks on me,
my dad can beat up his dad!
Can't I just beat up the kid?
Well, okay, Leela.
If you think you can put up with
your father, then welcome home.
We'll try to respect your
independence and freedom.
No! I want the real teen experience.
Chores, curfew, the works!
Fine, sweetiekins, we'll be
the strictest parents ever.
Now, let's all have some
tequila to celebrate!
Dad, I'm underage!
Oh, right.
Here's a silly straw.
Oh, my Amy is sweet little girl again.
This like a mother's dream!
Bad dream, that is. At this rate,
I'm never gonna get a grandchild!
Maybe she not grown up,
but she sure grown out. She fat!
Dad, if you're gonna make fat
jokes till I get cute again...
I'm just gonna stay in my room!
Stay in room? You so fat,
you gonna stay all around room.
I've got to find a way to escape
the horrible ravages of youth.
Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom
like clockwork, every three hours.
And those jerks at Social
Security stopped sending me checks.
Now I have to pay them!
I'm tired of you yapping!
All you ever do is complain.
You never try to make things better.
Well, I'm running away
from this dead-End family.
I know there's a place for
people like me, with new ideas.
There has to be!
Fine. Get going.
Oh, I'm going, and you're gonna be all,
"Where's Bender? I miss Bender! "
We won't know that until you leave.
Oh, I'm leaving.
There's the door.
I'll be good.
Ah. Do you have to shed
your skin on the couch?
What do we live in, a zoo?
I'm getting the doorbell.
For me?
Hello, sir. It's a lovely
evening you have tonight.
I'm here to pick up your daughter.
Hi, Fry. I like your blazer.
Thanks. These aren't pockets,
they're just flaps.
I put my money in my sock.
So where are you taking
my daughter tonight?
A movie.
A movie, ma'am.
Well, whatever you're really doing,
don't wake us if you get in after 12.
Dad, you're being too lenient again.
I have to be back by 11.
Okay, okay! You're the boss.
No, I'm not!
I'd like a sewer burger,
but without the rat feces.
What, are you on a diet?
Leela, you look hot.
Jeez, Moose. Just dump me right
in front of her, why don't you.
Moose, Mandy, this is my friend Fry...
From the surface.
Oh, so this is the famous Fry.
What is he...
Like, the biggest loser on the surface
so he has to hang out in the sewer?
They're onto me!
Hey, come on
Let's act like grownups here.
Wanna race?
Yeah.
Theres. The world's drinkings
water is safes for another days.
Whoas! Cripe!
A tapeworm!
We missed the turn!
We'll never catch them.
Yes, we will. This sewer goes right
under Planet Express, and it's 9 p.m.
The devil take this predictable colon!
All right!
Whoo-Hoo!
Leela, you can stop winning now, we won!
I can't reach the hand brake!
That's detention.
And then a giant tapeworm
tried to play us for chumps...
But we totally dissed Moose.
Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose.
But in the meantime, I have good news!
I may have solved our age problem.
Yay!
It seems the youth-A-Sizing tar was
saturated with time-Altering kronatons.
A thin layer is still
stuck to our DNA...
As well as Bender's robo, or "RNA. "
Question.
Yes?
You stink.
Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed
an oil-Eating bacterium...
That should take the tar right off.
Come on. Let's go tell Leela
so we can grow up together.
Thanks, professor,
but I don't want the treatment.
Don't you understand, you little nitwit?
Unless you're treated soon,
the only way to restore your true age...
Will be to grow into it,
just as God intended.
He has a point, honey.
What about your job and your friends?
Do you really want to
abandon your old life?
My old life wasn't as glamorous
as my web page made it look.
All I ever wanted was
to grow up here with you.
Please?
Well, if it's what you really want.
It is, I know it is.
I'll miss you, Leela.
I'll come back and visit
when I'm all grown up.
Bring beer.
No beer till you finish your tequila!
The age-Restoring microbes are ready.
Everyone into the
bacterial spew chamber.
Yes, everyone do the same thing.
Initiating controlled infection.
I'm no doctor, but this
machine guy could use a lozenge.
Ah, poo! We're even younger!
Damn! The bacteria
pigged out on the tar...
And now they're getting freaky deaky...
Spreading kronatons
throughout our systems!
We're getting younger by the minute!
What? I'm gonna revert
through all my larval stages?
Word. We'll all keep getting
younger and younger...
Until we suffer a fate worse than death:
Pre-Life! Then death.
I've got to stop this reverse
aging before we all shrivel up...
And suffer the agony of un-Birth!
Think, you disco duck, think!
What's that squirmal under your shirt?
Oh. Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!
Oh, sure, you need all your blood!
Would you all chill?
I can't think with you
kids cramping my style!
I need a babysitter.
Okay, quiet time.
I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate
your tongues, and I'll read you a story.
Yeah, a story!
I can't see from down here, I can't!
There.
Today's story is from Muteen Magazine.
Who would you rather hear about,
Four-Legged Chachi or Tentacle Chachi?
I want to hear a space story!
It's kind of a baby book,
but okay. Let's see.
"Snow White Dwarf and
the Seven Red Dwarfs."
"Charlotte's Tholian Web."
"The Fountain of Aging."
The Fountain of Aging? Hm.
It is just a legend.
Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a
legend, and now he's head of the FBl!
What's up? Kids ready?
Yay! Professie's back!
Ew. You smell like smoking.
And drinking!
I had a few beers,
but I'm cool to drive.
I wish I could come with
you to say goodbye...
Before you all turn
back into grownups...
But I'm grounded for
knocking the school over.
Who cares, Leela?
It was just a public school.
Now, go with your friends, please.
No! A grounded teenager
must be confined to her room!
Until she sneaks out.
When I grow up,
I wanna be a steam shovel!
According to this, the fountain
is located in the darkest...
Most ancient region of space,
just past Teddy Bear Junction.
Teddy Bear Junction,
the worst scum-Hole in the galaxy.
This solar system is, like, way old!
Look how high the asteroid belt
is pulled up on that planet!
News flash:
Everything's getting older the closer
we get to that ancient, burnt-Out sun.
Dude, the Fountain of Aging
must be on the sun itself!
Shut up! I was gonna say that.
We've got to hurry.
The kids have only one change of pants.
We gotta be real, real careful
to stay in just long enough...
To make us our right ages again.
Zoidberg, get out of there!
The current!
It's too much already! Help!
Jeepers!
Zoidberg is dead!
Zoidberg's brother is dead.
Funny story. I just reverted to the
age when my siblings budded from me...
And my brother Norman split
off and jumped in the fountain.
He always had to be
the center of attention!
Let him go.
Oh, no!
Quick! Get them into the fountain!
Thanks for the help, Leela.
Once we're growed up,
you can go back to your family.
We'll never bother you again.
Well, you could bother me a little.
It's working! Hooray!
I can't hold on!
I'm coming in after you!
No, Leela!
You can't give up your childhood.
You'll never have another chance at it!
We did it!
We're the right ages again!
I think I might be a
couple years younger!
Oh, me too!
Help!
I'm still in mid-Peril, you clods!
He's too far out!
We can't reach him!
With my last breath,
I curse Zoidberg!
Pazoozoo!
You came back to me.
Are you back to your
original age, professor?
Even older! Huzzah!
I'm sorry you had to give
up being a kid, Leela.
Well, I guess every adult wants
to be a kid again sometimes.
But I worked hard to be the person I am.
The fabulous person.
With friends like you guys.
Fabulous friends.
And I'm really happy
I have that life back.
And you, my faithful fiend,
how can I ever repay you?
And that, little one,
is how Papa gained his freedom.
Now, bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit to you all.
Futurama [5x08] - The Why Of Fry - CiWaN
Delivery boy Philip J. Fry,
reporting for duty.
Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine.
Ah
What is the meaning of this?
We've got a delivery. Let's move!
Amy, mission profile.
Interesting. Interesting.
Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?
Packed and ready, sir.
What's this? This is the same
toy surprise I got last time.
I can't work under these conditions.
And without me, there is no mission.
I am the mission.
We're back from the mission.
What? You went without me?
You were looking up curse
words in the dictionary.
It seemed like a better use of your time.
But I'm the delivery boy.
Don't worry, everything went fine.
Better than usual.
We got medals.
Good work, team. We really
pulled together on this one.
Whoo-Hoo!
They got medals.
I'm real sorry I missed the mission.
You might have needed me.
Nope.
But if I'd been there, l--
Nope!
Look--
Nope.
Bender's great.
Nope.
Leela, let me make it up by
taking you out for dinner tonight.
Nope, I've got a date with Chaz.
Chaz?
I met him at that charity cockfight
last week. He's the mayor's aide.
Oh, you go, mutant girl.
Oh.
I do go. He's a very important man.
So? I'm just as important as him.
It's just that the kind of importance
I have, it doesn't matter if I don't do it.
Oh, I'm nobody.
There are guys in the background
of "Mary Worth" comics...
Who are more important than me.
Buck up, meat loaf. Bender will
take you out and cheer you up.
What do you want to do?
And I mean anything. You have the power.
Name it and I'm there. You the man.
Well, okay. Let's go bowling.
Nah.
Table for two? Step right this way.
I'm afraid we don't have a reservation,
but as you can see...
I'm the mayor's aide.
Table for two, please.
Okay, then.
Hey!
It's okay, my man...
I got you covered on your
next health inspection.
Oh, I really appreciate that,
Mr. Mayor's Aide. Here you go.
Compliments of the house.
Wow! Free bread at a restaurant!
Is there anything you can't do?
I can't fail the mayor. Not ever.
Oh.
Oh, jeez, I better not let Leela see me.
Hey, I hear Fry.
Boy, am I glad you're here.
You are?
Things aren't working
out with what's-His-Name?
Actually, they are.
Confidentially, I might not make
it back to my apartment tonight.
Could you walk Nibbler for me?
Ah...
And bring a baggie, in case he
drops a steamer. Have a great night.
Oh, no. Please, no!
Perfect.
Whoa. Smells like a 289 in progress.
Failure to scoop. Oh, yeah.
Wait, I'm trying.
It weighs as much as 1,000 suns.
Don't worry. I'll pull some strings,
see if I can't get you tried as a juvenile.
Oh, Chaz.
I'm as worthless as this trashcan.
You think I'm as worthless as you?
Try catching garbage in your head
and raising six kids, you dumb townie.
Oh, Nibbler, at least
I'm important to you...
Even if it's only because
I clean up your poop.
The poop eradication is but
one aspect of your importance.
Did you just talk?
Indeed...
And I have other amazing powers as well.
Like what?
Are you my mommy?
Negative.
Welcome, Lord Nibbler.
Welcome acknowledged.
I bring with me The Mighty One.
Uh?
At last, our centuries upon centuries
of waiting have achieved fruition.
Aren't you a fuzzy little guy?
Stop that! Please, Your Mightiness.
"Mightiness"? Are you off your nut?
I got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs.
Does he not know?
He does not know.
He knows not?
Knows not does he.
Not he knows?
Enough!
Fry, it is my duty to inform
you that the fate of humanity...
The fate of our race, indeed,
the fate of all that exists...
And ever will exist, rests with you.
You are the single most
important person in the universe.
Oh, snap.
On this auspicious occasion, let the
horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast.
The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun.
You gonna eat that?
Maybe later.
The time has come to discuss
matters of the gravest importance.
Fry, do you remember some months ago...
When Earth was attacked
by Flying Brains?
I remember the dancing stomachs.
That might've been a Mylanta commercial.
Wait, the Brains! I do remember...
But no one else does.
They said I was crazy.
You remember because you were...
The only one immune to
the Brains' mental attack.
Because I'm so smart?
Oh, my.
Anyway, your immunity is due to the
fact that you lack the delta brain wave.
It's a genetic abnormality, which resulted
when you went back in time...
And performed certain actions
which made you your own grandfather.
I did do the nasty in the past-Y.
Verily, and that past nastification
is what shields you from the Brains.
You are the last hope of the universe.
So I really am important?
How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
Yes, except the Dave
Matthews Band doesn't rock.
For a thousand years, the evil
Brains have been constructing...
The info-Sphere, a giant memory bank...
Twice the size of three
ordinary memory banks.
What's evil about that?
They plan to collect...
All the information in the universe
and store it within the sphere.
They're trying to learn things?
Right.
Those bastards!
Being brains, they feel compelled...
To know everything, and soon they will.
I'm as mad as I've ever been.
Once their task is complete...
They will ensure that no
new information arises...
In the only way possible.
By destroying the universe.
Now it's personal.
Your mission is to
infiltrate the info-Sphere...
And plant this quantum interface bomb...
Blasting them into an alternate
universe from which there is no return.
Then outrun the blast on
this Scooty-Puff Junior.
Okay, let's go through
this once more from the--
Brains!
Fear not, Mighty One.
Your missing brain wave
makes you invisible to them.
So long as you avoid intense thinking.
Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.
That is most wise.
Who?
In a few seconds,
the Brains will finish scanning...
The last bits of
information in the universe.
Beavers mate for life.
Eleven greater than four.
For quality carpets,
visit Caplan 's Carpet Warehouse.
Now the info-Sphere will
open its protective crust...
So as to scan itself,
completing its thousand-Year task.
This is your one chance to enter
the sphere. Scoot. Scoot now!
I'm at the input console.
I'm nervous, and I've got
brain in my butt crack.
Roger.
Once you press the detonator, you will
have 60 seconds for an exciting escape.
Hey, wait. This Brain knows
about everything, right?
It will soon. That's why you're
supposed to be setting off a bomb.
I can't pass up a chance
to learn the answers...
To the greatest questions of all time.
Is it true that postage-Stamp
glue is made of--?
Correct, toad mucus.
There's no time for this.
Activate the bomb.
Wait, wait, wait.
What really killed the dinosaurs?
Me!
Unauthorized data access.
Uh-Oh.
Detecting trace amounts
of mental activity.
Possibly a dead weasel
or a cartoon viewer.
Ew! Gross, cut it out.
Odd, he is immune to our psionic attack.
Impossible. We're an ambitious
young squad with everything to prove.
It appears we are in the
presence of the fabled one...
But without his Scooty-Puff Junior,
he cannot escape.
A quantum interface bomb?
Are you insane in the membrane?
You got it, Poindexter.
Oh, not good.
Detonation in T-Minus 60 Earth seconds.
You fool! You will be transported
to the other universe with us.
Trapped there for all eternity.
We'll form a tight clique
that you won't be part of.
Well, at least I did one
important thing with my life...
Leading good to victory over evil.
Yeah!
Exactly!
The Nibblonians? Good? Ha.
During your last moments in this
universe, perhaps you should query...
Our database concerning the
night of December 31, 1999.
The day I got frozen? What about it?
No.
Don't ask about that.
It would be boring.
Forget it, then.
Query!
Okay.
What happened to me, Philip J. Fry,
on the night of December 31 , 1999?
Clarification request. Are you
the Philip J. Fry from Earth...
Or the Philip J. Fry from
Hovering Squid World 97A?
Earth, you fat idiot. Hurry up.
Hello? Pizza delivery for...
"I. C. Wiener"? Oh, crud.
Uh, I can't believe how fat I look.
Oh, Nibbler's there. Wait. What?!
What the--?
I-- I don't understand.
You made me go in the freezer tube?
Detonation in T-Minus 15 seconds.
You little runts froze me.
You took away my life.
We can explain.
No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap.
We had no choice. You were
the only one who could help us.
What is one life weighed
against the entire universe?
But it was my life.
Detonation in two, one--
Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird--?
Oh, never mind, zero!
Well, here we are, trapped for eternity.
We could sing "American Pie. "
Go ahead, I deserve it.
I wish those stupid raccoons had
never brought me to the future.
I have shocking data
relevant to this conversation.
We don't care, you dope.
We're in another universe.
You're not in charge.
It is possible for the Philip Fry to
resume his life on December 31 , 1999.
Really? I can go back in time?
There is a nexus point...
At the space-Time where you
entered the cryogenic tube.
You, and only you, can return there.
Interesting. You could
stop the Nibblonian...
From pushing you into
the cryogenic tube.
That is interesting. Why?
It will be as if you
never came to the future.
You will have your life back,
and we will succeed...
In our plan to understand
and destroy the universe.
Everybody wins.
The human returns to the past!
Meanwhile....
I love rocket skating,
but the wait is always so long.
Poor Fry once stood in line six
hours just to get me a ticket.
Six hours? Sounds like a real nobody...
But now it's time for somebody and
some chick he's with to go skating.
You reserved the whole rink?
Yep, buzzed ahead...
Let them know whose aide was coming by.
The mayor's, that's whose.
Oh, Chaz!
Mr. Vogel, I thought
we was going skating.
No, we're not important enough.
Everybody just hold hands until the
bus driver comes back from his haircut.
Oh, let's let those kids skate with us.
What? Seriously?
I'm trying to impress you with my clout.
I know, and it's working.
But think how much skating
would mean to those kids.
We came here instead of eating today.
This might be their only chance
to skate here their whole lives.
Who are we to say they can't?
The mayor's aide and his badge.
Beat it, kids! Come back
when you got connections.
All right, little ones...
Back to the orphanarium. You can
slide around the gym in your socks.
What socks?
So am I gonna get
lucky tonight, or what?
I hope your calculations are correct.
Our calculations are always correct,
for we are gigantic brains.
Initiate space-Time transfer.
I hereby place an order
for one cheese pizza.
One pie, nothing good on it. Name?
I-Period-C-Period Wiener.
Talk a little louder. It sounds like
you got some kind of tiny head on you.
Hello? Pizza delivery for...
 "I.C. Wiener"? Oh, crud.
Gotcha!
I don't understand.
Yes, you do.
You came back in time to
knock me into that freezer...
And now I came back to stop you.
I did not come back in time.
My people lack that ability.
But I know you in the future.
I cleaned your poop.
Quite possible. We live long
and are celebrated poopers.
You will meet me when
I'm 1,000 years older.
Not if you don't freeze me.
Please, our sages foresee
that in 1,000 years...
For one moment, the fate of
the universe will depend on you.
Since you will not live that long,
I must freeze you now.
Well, why couldn't you just ask me?
We were afraid you would refuse.
Of course not, I love the future.
Then why are you choking me right now?
Because I don't like being used.
Well, now it's your choice. Is there
nothing in the future worth saving?
Hmm. Leela, but she
doesn't think much of me.
Oh, she must be The Other.
What?
You must not give up on her.
I am stationed on a distant
world known as Virgon Six...
But if you return to the future,
I will transfer to Earth...
To give you what help I can.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
You think I had a chance with Leela?
You must choose.
The present or the future?
To save yourself or save Leela.
One!
Yes! Here I come, future.
Oh, no, wait!
I'm gonna get trapped
in the info-Sphere again.
Just remember that
Scooty-Puff Junior sucks!
In 1,000 years, I'll get right on it.
And so 1,000 years later,
Fry once again...
Infiltrated the info-Sphere
and set off his amazing bomb.
Only this time....
Thank you for saving the universe, Fry.
Here.
Oh, thanks.
If you ever need a
savior again, just ask.
Oh, we will. We will.
I can't wait to tell
everyone what happened.
Yes. Incidentally, I need
to remain undercover...
So I'm blanking your memory.
Did everything just
taste purple for a second?
Oh, well, let's go home,
you dumb poop machine.
Bender, would you do the honors?
With gusto.
Hey, Leela. I guess I got this for you.
Oh, thank you.
You know what?
I don't care if you're not...
The most important
person in the universe.
It really makes me happy
to see you right now.
Then I am the most important
person in the universe.
Yes!
Futurama [5x09] - The Sting - CiWaN
A hush comes over the crowd.
The only sound is Bender calling
everyone else a jerk as he swings!
And he slices into the water!
Man!
Boy, I tell you, buddy.
Bad news, everyone! You're not good
enough to go on your next mission.
Hooray!
Not good enough!
Why? Says who?
Because. And says me.
It's an extremely dangerous
mission that killed my last crew.
And you're not nearly as good as them.
Woo-Hoo!
We live to suck another day!
Oh...
We're just as good as any of those
other crews you sent to their deaths.
What's the mission?
Collecting honey, ordinary honey.
That doesn't sound so dangerous.
This is no ordinary honey!
It's produced by vicious space bees.
A single sting of their hideous
neurotoxin can cause instant death!
That's if you're not allergic. You don't
wanna know what happens then, no, no.
Your insides will boil out of your eye
sockets like a science fair volcano!
I didn't want to know!
These bees are larger than
most Buicks and twice as ugly.
Larger than an American sedan?
How big is the honeycomb?
Honeycomb's big.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's not small?
No, no, no.
It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees
to keep us from doing our job.
Come on, boys.
But, Leela, we're no good.
Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm
more scared of disappointing myself.
I'm not scared of that at all.
Now, bees communicate by dancing.
Like my parents!
Oh, wait, that was hitting.
So this language cartridge
will let you distract them.
Ah, good. I often have thoughts that
can only be expressed through dance.
Bender, quick!
Waggle something!
Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely
no shame in wussing out.
Relax, everything'll be fine.
Oh, my God!
The old Planet Express ship!
There's the black box.
Captain! The bees have us surrounded!
Oh, the professor was right!
We're not as good as his old crew!
Well, I aim to prove him wrong.
It'll take more than a few deadly,
deadly bees to-- Oh, Lord!
I couldn't make that out.
Too much static.
Eww.
We found it!
The honeycomb hideout!
Hey, what's this goop?
Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
Bees make honey and jelly?
How come nothing
humans make tastes good?
Help! I can't swim in jelly,
as far as I know!
Look!
It's a baby queen!
She's so cute! You adorable,
wittle, itty-Bitty, fuzzy, wuzzy--
Leela, stop bonding and let's go!
I got jelly in my underpants!
I'm taking this bee with us.
With a queen, we can build a hive
and make more honey ourselves.
Let me just pack her
a lunch and we'll go.
Pick up the pace, lady!
I'm sick of shaking my
booty for these fat jerks.
I didn't mean you're all fat.
Just Fatso there.
Help!
This is where we distinguish
ourselves from the last crew.
Activate emergency high-Speed,
self-Contained escape pack...
Crisis response units.
Quick!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ah! Ooh! Ah!
Good luck, Bender!
I'm back, baby!
We made it! We're alive!
Burn on that old crew!
The only things they did better
than us were suck and die.
Leela, we got lucky this time,
but you should be more careful.
I don't want anything to happen to you.
Thanks, but I can look out for myself.
Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away.
Look out!
You want her?
You're gonna have to go through me!
You call that a wound?
That's a boo-Boo, tops.
But thanks for trying
to save me, Fry. Fry?
He's...
He's dead.
Oh, who will make Bender waffles
just the way he likes them now?
It was all my fault!
He died because of me!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm lying to make her feel better.
Husband, can't you go anywhere
without lighting something up?
It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition.
We burn his timecard.
That way his zombie doesn't come
back looking for his final paycheck.
He looks so natural.
It's funny to think he's crammed
full of sawdust and preservatives.
I only wish I could've
removed the stinger.
I barely knew Philip.
But as a clergyman...
I have no problem telling his most
intimate friends all about him.
Soothe us with sweet lies.
It may comfort you to know
Fry's death took only 15 seconds.
Yet the pain was so intense that
it felt to him like 15 years.
And it goes without saying,
it caused him to empty his bowels.
We now commend Fry's body to the ages.
He's walking on sunshine now.
This makes me the oldest
member of my family.
Him do good snu-Snu.
Eh...
All those times I said, "Kill all humans",
I'd always whisper, "except one".
Fry was that one,
and I never told him so!
Farewell from the world of tomorrow!
They say a spoonful of space
honey helps ease the pain.
Mm.
It's good.
I feel funny.
Ha-Ha funny.
Huh?
Leela?
Fry? I thought you were dead.
Nope, I'm better than ever.
Before the accident, I couldn't do this:
Impressive! But it does sort of
support my you-Are-Dead theory.
Then I'll prove I'm alive by telling
you something only I could know.
There's a surprise for you in my locker.
I got it at a Swedish
novelty shop before we left.
It's too beautiful to open.
Can I open it?
Sure. There's just one
thing I want you to do.
What?
I want you to wake up.
Wake up?
But I'm not--
In my dream, Fry said he hid
a gift for me in his locker.
If it's true, then he must
still exist in some form.
Of course he still exists.
As a frozen corpse in outer space.
Oh, I made myself sad.
Well, here goes.
Oh .
Bupkis.
Well, I feel better now.
Pawning all the stuff in Fry's
locker helped give me closure.
Was there a gift for me?
No, nothing. Not at all.
No way, José.
Here it is.
You took this from Fry's locker?
The guy's dead.
There's no law against grave robbing.
That proves it! Fry is alive somewhere
and he's reaching me in my dreams!
Bull pies!
Lay down here and we'll do some tests.
If Fry is out there somewhere...
Leela's brain could be acting
as a five-Pound Ouija board.
Is this some sort of brain scanner?
Some sort, yes.
In France, it's called a "guillotine".
Professor! Can't you examine
my brain without removing it?
Yes, easily.
Hey, what if Fry wasn't
actually dead when we buried him?
You know, like Julia Roberts.
Well, I suppose there's a slim--
I don't believe it!
What is it? Is Fry alive in some
other dimension or something?
No! According to this Gizmometer,
Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back.
Remarkable!
But, my dream!
Your science can't un-Prove that.
How could I have known...
The gift was in Fry's locker?
Easy.
He told you about it before he died and
your grief-Roasted mind blocked it out.
Are you saying I'm going crazy?
No, no. No one's saying that.
But I'm certainly thinking it loudly.
Hi, Leela. I'm just gonna keep
talking even if you can't hear me.
Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah--
Shut up! I can hear you!
The professor says you're just a dream.
Oh, yeah? Could a dream take
you dancing in a Vanusian garden?
Well, yes, technically.
But it's still very sweet of you.
Then what if we shared a midnight sleigh
ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?
Oh, Fry, you must be alive.
I've never been treated so romantically
by my own imagination before.
Here, take my jacket.
You look a little cold.
Thank you.
It's all so beautiful.
I forgot how many hundreds of
degrees below zero it must be.
I just wish I could convince
the others you're alive.
You can!
All you have to do is wake up.
No, no! Don't say that!
This is real!
Not another dream!
Fry's jacket!
The one he was buried in!
My dream was real!
He's alive!
Quit your bragging!
My boyfriend's alive too.
Oh, not anymore.
That's better.
Fry's alive! I have proof!
What?
You do not!
I'm from Jamaica, the "Show Me" island.
So show me you blowing
it out your fanny.
But he gave me his jacket.
Look!
That's not Fry's jacket.
Fry's jacket is red.
That's your jacket.
An off-The-Rack lime-Green affair.
But Fry-- His jacket--
And when I woke up it was on me!
You're under a lot of guilt stress, Leela.
Here, work it out.
I am not under stress, damn it!
Everything's going to
be all right, Leela.
What?
Everything's going to be all right.
Maybe I am freaking out a little.
A little? You're screwier than
my Aunt Rita, and she's a screw!
I need to calm down. I better
take some more of that space honey.
You've been taking space honey?
Be careful, you purple-Haired imbecile!
One spoonful calms you down.
Two spoonfuls help you sleep.
But three spoonfuls, and you'll
go into a sleep so deep...
You'll never wake up.
Never!
Never!
Never!
One spoonful to calm me down.
Okay, I got a pretty good calm going.
Two spoonfuls to help me sleep.
Uh-Oh. Still awake.
I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt.
Oh, my gosh!
I better get a sponge!
Fry? Is that you?
I don't need a sponge!
Why am I sticky and naked?
Did I miss something fun?
Incredible! According to the Gizmometer,
Fry touched the royal jelly...
In the space hive, leaving an
imprint of his DNA and brain waves.
Then, when it spilled on the couch...
It recombined with trace
amounts of Fry's hair and skin--
And blood!
Don't forget about Fry's blood.
Yes, Bender, thank you.
In short, the various fluids
Fry left in the couch...
Caused the royal jelly to
regenerate his entire being!
Neat.
This is great!
My buddy's alive and his
credit cards are valid again.
Let's go get hammered!
I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk.
Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.
Me too.
Feeling responsible for your
death was driving me mad.
But now everything is all right.
Not everything.
What? What do you mean?
You have to wake up.
Wake up? Oh, no. No!
It can't be!
Poo!
I'm cracking up. In my dreams
I'm happy because Fry is alive.
But when I'm awake my
mind plays tricks on me.
Take it easy, Leela.
In every life we have some trouble.
But when you worry, you make it double.
Uh, were you just singing?
No, I was telling you not to worry.
I'm not allowed to sing.
Court order.
I'll find Fry's coffin,
get his corpse...
And keep it under my mattress
to remind me he's dead.
That'll prove I'm not insane.
Okay, it's just an ordinary coffin...
Containing my ordinary
dead friend, who I killed!
What happened?
Why am I in my apartment?
You killed Fry!
You killed Fry!
You killed Fry!
Stop it!
Stop it!
You killed Fry.
Okay, I'm insane.
But I'm still sane enough to know it.
The only time I feel all
right is in my dreams with you.
Three spoonfuls,
then I can dream forever.
One.
Two.
Here goes.
Goodbye, waking world.
Leela, no!
Listen to me!
You don't want to lie in bed and
do nothing the rest of your life.
I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!
Then what am I supposed to do?
Fight it!
I can't!
You can! The Leela I know
doesn't give up this easily.
Okay, I'll try.
Go away!
I don't know if you can hear me.
But there's something I wanna tell you.
I love you.
I'm so scared, Fry!
I don't know what to do!
Just wake up, Leela. Please.
Just wake up.
I don't understand what you mean!
Just wake up.
Please. Just wake up, Leela.
Fry. You're alive.
Leela! You're awake!
Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't
stop waking me. Where am I?
In a hospital. The ambulance took
you here after the bee stung you.
But the bee stung you.
It barely touched me.
The stinger went through me
and you got all the poison.
My new spleen came from a guy who
liked to motorcycle. Vroom, vroom.
Sweet three-Toed sloth of
ice planet Hoth, she's awake!
You were in the best
coma I've ever seen!
The doctor said you'd never wake up.
Really? How long was I out?
Two weeks.
Fry never left your side for a minute.
And he talked nonstop.
Like a parrot of the sea, he was.
I thought maybe if you
heard a familiar voice...
It might help keep your mind together.
But who knows if it really got through?
It got through, Fry.
It got through.
You could really use a shower.
You too.
Futurama [5x10] - The Farnsworth Paradox - CiWaN
Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!
I know you've rejected me a lot before,
but frankly...
I wasn't sure we were right for
each other either. But now I am!
So how about a date tonight?
Sorry! I think I...
I think I left my toaster on.
Buddha! Zeus! God!
One of you guys, do something!
Come on, Leela. What's the real
reason you won't go out with me?
Help, Satan! You owe me!
Look, I'm embarrassed to admit this,
but you've forced me to.
I can't go out tonight
Because I have sweaty boot rash!
No spluh.
Why do you think I'm sitting
over here in the stink-Free zone?
So will you go out with me?
Good news, everyone!
I'm still technically alive, yes.
But I need you to dispose of
this crazy-Ass experiment...
That almost killed me.
You'll have to throw
it into the sun itself.
For only the thermal
nuclear inferno of the sun...
Has enough energy to ensure
its total destruction.
I could hit it with a shovel.
That's not good enough.
This one time I pounded a guy into
the ground like a stake with a shovel.
Yes, yes.
So, what's in the box already?
No peeking!
Ow! Oh! Oh! Oh!
I don't know what's in there.
But I'm sure our minds would
be unable to comprehend it.
Ow! You hurt my collator!
I don't care.
Listen well.
No matter what happens...
No matter how great your curiosity,
you are forbidden to look in this box.
Forbidden!
Pretty tantalizing, though.
Whatever's in there,
it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
In my experience boxes
are usually empty...
Or maybe with a little
cheese stuck to the top.
And one time, pepperoni.
What a day that was!
Give me the box!
Scram, you lousy green snakes!
Here, Leela. Take this and
use it to shoot those guys.
Right. If they try to look in the box.
Whatever.
Let's just forget about the box.
The professor said to stay away.
Fry, how can you be so naive?
He was joking, get it?
No.
That's what makes it so funny!
Okay, he wasn't joking.
Now shut up and follow me.
Ow! It's hot!
The butter in my pocket is melting!
Yep.
We thank you, Bender,
for the gift we are about to receive.
Tangled-Up Christmas lights!
We can take shifts untangling them!
And unlabeled booze!
Wide-Mouth too!
That ought to keep those dopes occupied.
I can guard the real box in peace
now that no one's curious about it.
Well, I got through the night,
and no one looked in the box.
Not even me. The person who gave
up her whole evening to watch it.
A whole evening of TV, gone!
What a mockery of justice
That I can't take even a
little tiny peek. I need coffee.
Okay, heads I look, tails I don't.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!
Heads! I mean, all right, then.
No. I have a duty not to look.
Well, then again,
I promised the coin I would.
Oh, it's deep.
Deeper than a small box should be.
Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
What have you done?
Nothing! What do you mean,
why was I looking in the box?
I meant your hair.
It's all different-Y.
Bender? Ls--? Is that you?
You know it. Large and in charge.
Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you.
Always dyeing her hair instead
of not looking in a box.
I didn't dye my hair.
This is how I always look.
No, that's how you always look.
This throws my entire perception
of reality into question.
Clone? Robot? Or long-Lost twin?
Taking all bets!
I also offer video poker!
It's some guy wearing a Leela costume!
Get him!
Hold it!
You have this all wrong!
I just fell into the box
and then I fell out somehow.
You shut up, sir!
No, wait! I've got it!
I know what's in the box!
Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry.
Am not!
It contains a parallel universe!
And when you create
a parallel universe...
It's almost always
populated by evil twins.
Now look, I am not evil.
My loan officer said so.
Oh, you'd like us to believe
that wouldn't you, Leela?
Or should I say, "Evilla"?
This is awful! Somewhere, there's
a more evil Bender than me!
I do my best, damn it!
Leela? The good Leela.
I want you to snoop around
the other universe...
And find out how evil they are.
Here.
I tell you, they're not evil.
But don't be confused.
They are jerks.
Hello.
Ow!
Come out of your universe
with your hands up!
Oh, wow! It's like that drug
trip I saw in that movie...
When I was on that drug trip.
Astonishing!
I must have created a parallel universe.
Baldercrap! I created your universe!
All you created was my
fist parallel to your face!
Ow.
It doesn't matter who created what.
The important thing is--
We're exactly the same.
I know all her moves.
Therefore, I've got the upper hand.
Now, now, perfectly symmetrical
violence never solved anything.
Let's recap what's happened so far.
As you can see, I accidentally
created a box containing your universe.
While I, in a simultaneous blunder,
created a box containing your universe.
This is getting confusing. Why don't
we call our universe "Universe A"
And this universe "Universe B. "
Hey! Why can't we be Universe A?
We want A!
It's the best letter!
We called it first. Besides, this
place kind of feels like a B, you know?
All right, you can be crummy Universe A.
And we'll be Universe One.
Or the Mongooses. That's a cool
team name. "The Fighting Mongooses."
Wait a second!
If everyone is identical...
Why did our Leela look into
the box and your Leela didn't?
Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin.
It came up tails, so I didn't look.
That's weird.
Mine came up heads, so I did.
Interesting. Apparently the key
difference between our universes...
Is that coin flips
have opposite outcomes.
That explains fruity here.
I tossed a coin to pick my finish.
Fog hat gray.
Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!
You people and your slight
differences disgust me! I'm going home.
Where's that blue box
with our universe in it?
Oh, you'd like to get back to
your evil universe, wouldn't you?
And destroy your box with
our universe inside it!
Nonsense!
I would never do such a thing.
Unless you were already
having been going to do that!
Wha--?!
You heard me!
In any case, I've hidden the box,
and it will remain hidden
Until I'm convinced you're not evil.
Everyone, keep an eye
on your evil counterpart.
And you all do the same!
Can Fry and I watch our parallel
selves together? We have plans tonight.
You guys are dating?
Oh, no, no. We're married.
I got my eye on you, boy!
Don't even think about it, lunch pail!
You'd be dead before you hit the ground.
Good point. What do you say
we just hit a strip joint?
I was waiting for one of us to say that!
Bender A, you're a prince among robots.
Can you forgive me for distrusting you?
I can't stay mad at what is
essentially me. I love me!
This is so great!
I always wanted an imaginary friend!
I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel.
We're exactly the same,
right down to the--
Is that pink nail polish?
Is that not pink nail polish?
The professor's right, you are evil.
And shallow.
I am not evil!
So, Fry, Leela, how'd
you two get together?
Funny story. I asked Leela out a million
times, but she just kept rejecting me.
I'd make up stuff like,
"I have sweaty boot rash"
Or "I have to meet the president."
Oh, man, you never heard such excuses.
But, like a dope, I believed her.
Looking back on it now,
it's kind of funny.
It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny?
Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!
Then one night when Fry asked me out...
The only excuse I could
think of involved ghosts.
I knew he wouldn't buy it,
so I did what I do in those situations.
Oh, Lord.
I flipped a coin.
It came up heads, and we went out.
You mean you flipped a coin too?
And it was tails?
So that's why you said
you had to meet that ghost!
You really missed out on something,
Leela. That date was magical.
One year later I gave Leela a
diamond scrunchy, and we were married.
Ooh!
One year later I got beat up
at a Neil Diamond concert...
By a guy named Scrunchy!
Well, that was pointless.
Say, I hope you won't
think it "evil" of me...
To ask how you got
that stylish head wound.
Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting
to see if I could remove my own brain.
Of course! I had the same idea.
I flipped a coin to
decide if I should proceed.
But it came up tails, so I didn't.
How'd it go?
Well, getting the brain
out was the easy part.
The hard part was getting the brain out.
Oh, you!
So tell me about yourself.
Well, don't look into it, but I'm a
respected internal-Medicine doctor.
A can!
As for me, I design
mansions, then live in them.
I'm lying. I'm an appalling failure!
Me too! A big fat one!
And those coworkers,
always looking down on us Zoidbergs.
What are they, from Nob Hill?
They're all like, "Stop spraying me
with ink, Zoidberg!"
"Put on pants, Zoidberg!"
"Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg".
Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it?
Someday they'll watch from
down in the gutter, they will
As King Zoidberg
caresses their fancy box!
You know, maybe a certain blue lobster
saw where professor hid the box.
Good news, everyones!
After carefully reading the scriptures...
We've concluded that
none of us are evil.
Yes, the Bible is the real good news.
Anyhow, you're all free to
go back to your own universe.
What's going on here? Why aren't you
all out destroying the professor's box?
Hermes, aren't you curious
that there's two of everybody?
No. Now, like my granny used to say
in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay:
"If you want a box
hurled into the sun...
You got to do it yourself."
Your granny can go to hell!
I've hidden the box so no one
can destroy the home universe...
Of my handsome friend here.
Oh, go on.
Wait a second! If your Hermes
was about to destroy the box...
Containing our universe...
Then your Hermes...
Oh, my.
And sure enough....
Like Granny said,
"If you want a box hurled into the sun...
You got to do it yourself!"
God rest her zombie bones.
So we go back through
the box and stop Hermes.
Right. Good thing Professor B
there hid it in the coelacanth tank.
No one but a crazy
lobster would look there.
It's gone!
All hail Zoidberg,
the king with the box.
Now it's my turn, maybe?
The box says no.
Meanwhile in Universe A,
Hermes A heads towards the sun!
A.
Item one: box. Check.
Item two: sun.
That's a big check.
Oh!
If I know parallel Hermes,
he's at the sun by now!
Our universe is doomed!
Doomed!
Now, don't give up yet, you crybabies.
The box is gone, but we still
have one preposterously slim hope.
Is it a kind of hair spray?
No!
We must attempt to make another
box containing our universe.
Well, is that your universe in there?
Nope. Too cold.
Hmm. All women.
I'll put this one aside for later.
It's hopeless!
We'll never find your universe in time!
Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head!
Yes, it's the apocalypse, all right.
I always thought I'd have a hand in it.
I'm not sad, because I finally
found someone as great as me.
It's like I always say,
make new friends, but keep the old.
One is silver--
And the other's gold.
Why with the long faces?
The idiots have the box!
I think she means you.
Grab them!
You coward! Wait for me!
Look! Which one did they go into?
Oh, let's all ask each other!
That'll solve this problem!
We'll each have to search a universe.
Everyone, grab a length of wire
first so you can find your way back.
Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?
We didn't see anything. Ever.
Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?
Hell, no!
Shut up!
Beat it, jerk!
Have you robot versions of you guys
seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?
Negative. Will you go out with me?
Access denied.
Hey, pal, look what I snagged
from the Leprechaun Universe!
Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine,
if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!
Faith and begorra!
Quis?
Quick, into another box!
There aren't any in this universe,
there aren't. Hey, you!
What with the no boxes?
Baby, they're somewhere.
Everything's, like, somewhere.
Place is kind of au naturel right now.
There they are!
Ah!
Gotcha!
Dig it! All of you fitting in this
box is, like, seriously freaked up!
Nonsense! Why, there's a
whole universe in there!
Dude, there's a universe in all of us.
Right on, Professor Freaksworth!
Get a job!
We've got the box!
Everyone, pull your wires!
Hurry!
Back to Universe A!
Hermes, don't press that button!
Okay.
Bye-Bye.
Later!
So long, Your Majesty!
There but for the flip of a coin go we.
So, Leela? Seeing how the
universe wasn't destroyed...
You wanna catch an ape fight?
You know, together?
Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.
So heads or tails?
You know, let's just say it's heads.
Ready? One.
Two. Three. Pull!
There. That space-Time eversion has
given us their box, and vice versa.
What you think you just
explained to us, is that--
Correct! This box
contains our own universe!
Sweet honeybee of infinity!
Bender, quit destroying the universe!
But-- Oh!
Yes, all that is and ever
shall be is in that box.
And the box itself is
probably worth something too.
We must cherish it as we cherish
every moment of our lives.
Futurama [5x11] - Three Hundred Big Boys - CiWaN
This Week in the Universe.
Dateline, Tarantulon 6.
The brave warriors of Earth...
Under the command of Gen. Maj.
Webelo Zapp Brannigan...
Have achieved victory
over the spider homeworld.
And to the victor belong the spoils.
One trillion dollars in silken treasure.
My fellow Earthicans, after meeting
with top voodoo economists...
I have decided to refund
our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers.
That's right, I've sent
you each 300 buckaroos...
In the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill.
Knock yourselves out!
I'm slightly richer!
What to do, what to do?
One $300 hooker-Bot
or 300 $1 hooker-Bots?
I'm gonna swim with a whale.
They're the gentle giants of the deep.
I'm well aware of that.
Scruffy's gonna get himself
one of them $300 haircuts.
This one's lost its pizzazz.
A fortune, it is.
At last, Zoidberg will
live like a rich man!
Hey, cut it out. Go away.
Get away from me.
It's just 300 bucks.
What is that, like 100 cups of coffee?
That's it! I'm getting 100
cups of coffee, starting now.
Coffee machine,
one cup of coffee, please.
Smells good.
Leela, are you there?
No.
Oh, yes, you are. I'm hereby inviting
you and your oddball coworkers...
To a special reception to
display the national silk surplus.
I believe you know the heroic
space stallion who captured it.
Show them my medal, Kif.
He rented it with his tax refund.
So, Leela, will you have the pleasure?
What little there is to be had.
Tomorrow night at 8, then.
Smooches.
No cheap crack houses for me no more!
Very good, sir.
Shall I pre-Warm sir's crack pipe?
Oh, Kif, it was so romantic of you...
To rent this paddle plane
with your tax rebate.
We're like two dandelion
seeds wafting on the breeze.
Yes. Seeds. Wafting.
I almost feel kind of shallow for blowing
my rebate on this cool talking tattoo.
Hey, Gordon Gekko. I cost as
much as this whole crummy date!
Shut up! Ow!
Ma'am, it has become too
much of a chore for me...
To clean out my wrinkles each day.
Is it true that stem cells
may fight the aging process?
Well, yes. In the same way an
infant may fight Muhammad Ali, but--
One pound of stem cells, please!
Of course, any age-Reversing
effects will be purely temporary.
Ooh!
Oh!
Say, buddy, why is this
Grand Cigar so pricey?
Well, as you can see...
Its wrapper is a piece of the
original U.S. Constitution.
It was hand-Rolled by Queen
Elizabeth during her wild years...
And was buried with George Burns
until grave-Robbing space mushrooms--
Well, you know the rest.
Give you 300 bucks for it.
No can do.
Oh, all right. I'll just take
these $300 burglar's tools, then.
Very good, sir.
So, what time you close tonight?
Hey, Pops! Did that tax rebate come?
Came and went.
You're now the proud owner
of Bamboo Boogie Boots!
With a warning label this big,
you know they gotta be fun.
But, Pops, I don't want to have fun.
I want to be like you,
boring but prudently invested.
Babylon's bells!
I tallied almost 300 bananas
on this entertainment product!
Now you put them on and have fun.
I don't wanna!
Well, then, I'm gonna put them on
and make you watch me have fun! See?
Fun, fun--
Dwight! Help me!
I'll save you, Pops!
Hey! Turn that damn music--
Up.
Isn't this fun?
No! I wish I had two mommies!
Try these on, sir.
I ask for rich-Guy stuff,
and you give me shiny pebbles?
I bid you adieu.
Ah!
I'd like a pass to
swim with Mushu, please.
Well, you asked the right guy.
I'm the whale biologist.
Though, personally, I hate whales.
Especially Mushu.
Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
I don't know you well enough
to get into that. $300, please.
Noon tomorrow. If you're late,
you tread water in the scallop tank.
Yeah. I'll have a coffee.
Guppy, trout, mermaid or--?
Whale, please.
Amy, I also spent some of my
tax rebate on a gift for you.
Oh, Kify!
It shows the time wherever we
both are, and it's powered by love.
Also, you have to wind it.
Oh! Somebody won big at Skee-Ball!
You shut up!
I love it, Kif. I'll use it whenever
I want to know what time it is.
It's Fry and Leela.
Hi, Fry and Leela!
Keep peddling! Oh, for the
love of God, keep peddling!
Bye, Fry and Leela!
Oh.
Oh! I can't wait till the tattoos
on Amy's butt hear about this!
About what?
Tell us!
Don't feel sad, my little tadpole.
I'm trying not to...
But my gift to you is
in the belly of a whale.
Say, this reminds me of that time
I ate that other watch Kif gave you.
Hey, it is kind of like that.
To induce vomiting.
That was the solution.
Everywhere it went.
What a Valentine's Day that was.
Hmm. This may seem like
a huge coincidence...
But I happen to have
an in with that whale.
Scruffy's formulated a plan...
But you'll need a ready source
of nauseating rotten fish.
Freshen your coffee, sir?
Yeah. Keep it coming.
Put the pot down. Get away!
You're so young in spirit.
It's hard to believe you're as old as 25.
The key is to grab life by the ho-Joes.
Live every day like it might be your last.
What'll it be, kids?
One bowl of mild farina.
Pay dirt.
Here you go, big spender.
Foie gras and caviar.
Goose liver? Fish eggs?
Where's the goose? Where's the fish?
Hey, that's what rich people eat.
The garbage parts of the food.
I ate garbage yesterday,
and it didn't cost me $300!
I'm not paying. Farewell, good sir.
The Grand Cigar, she is mine.
And with absolutely no consequences.
You see that?
Grand-Theft tobacco.
Time to get off our
fat cop asses and ride.
Hey, you. This fish is slightly
too rotten to even make jambalaya.
So far so good. Where's Kif?
This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi!
The cup's shaking!
I don't want my coffee shaking!
You seem a tad wound up, buddy.
And your face is greasy. Real greasy.
Been up all night?
Of course I've been up all night!
It was insomnia.
I couldn't stop thinking about coffee.
I need a nap.
Coffee time!
Mighty fine smokable.
Fancy cigar.
Why don't you smoke it already!
Puff, puff! Go, go, go!
No. You can't blow the smoke
from such a majestic stogy...
In just anyone's face.
I'm saving it for the fancy-Pantses at
Zapp Brannigan's black-Tie reception.
You coming?
And the fifth reason whales
kill is for the sheer fun of it.
Anything else?
You're lumpy and you smell awful.
Hey, I calls them like I sees them.
I'm a whale biologist.
Okay, Mushu, it's feeding time.
Oh, crud. He ate my suit.
It was ugly! Whale biologist.
Perhaps if you tightened your grip, sir.
Thank you, golf slave.
Rich people wouldn't waste
their time on this nonsense.
Plus, these eggs are
gritty and tasteless.
Ow! Not so rough!
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Mushu!
The educated whale who
thinks he's better than you!
Come on, Mushu! Barf!
Barf like a freshman!
And now, ignorant whale lovers...
We'll see who's boss as I make
Mushu jump through this hoop!
Jump, Mushu.
Who wants a fish?
Mushu is sad!
It just keeps coming and coming.
Wait. That choke. It's the watch.
I got it, Amy. I got it.
The plan went off without a--
He's got aquarium property! Stop him!
Better do what he says.
He's a whale biologist.
You're under arrest, you squishy punk.
Oh.
Oh!
The Spidarians, though weak and
womanlike on the battlefield...
Are masters of the textile arts.
Taste like king crab, by the way.
Crazy bugs actually wove this
tapestry of my heroic conquest...
While I was still killing them.
What? It's not even scratch and sniff.
But if rich people think it's good,
I'll buy it. One art, please!
What a clever impersonation
of a stupid poor person.
How much is that place mat
actually worth, Brannigan?
Exactly $1 billion.
Now, that's walking-Around money.
What? Hey!
So I said to Kitty, "The only way to
keep the butler from running away...
Is to cut off his foot. "
Ah. Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh.
Yes, it reminds me of a joke I heard
about upper-Middle-Class people.
I've never been sad at a party before.
I wonder if my mind is thinking
about Kif being in jail?
Jail's not so bad.
You can make sangria in the toilet.
Of course, it's shank or be shanked.
Of course.
Look, just give back our property,
and we'll drop the charges.
Fine. Have the watch.
It's broken anyway.
I don't want your watch.
You're covered in precious ambergris.
Precious hamburgers?
"Ambergris. " Noun.
A greaselike product of the
sperm whale's digestive tract...
That is used as a base
in the finest perfumes.
This has been Roseanne,
your guide to the world of facts.
You heard Roseanne. Scrape off the
priceless ambergris, and I'll let you go.
Or better yet, I'll simply shed my skin.
Stop it. Stop it. It's fine.
I will destroy you!
Gotta go. Fight club.
What's happening, Hubie?
I'm afraid the face you fell in love with
was actually just a blob of living gunk...
I bought with my tax refund.
Well, as long as we're being honest...
I also spent my tax refund
on a crazy treatment.
That certainly is honest.
It's better for us to
both just be ourselves.
You, wrinkled as a prune.
You, fat as the queen of sea cows.
I love you!
Oh, my!
So you see, the putrid,
waxy substance...
I was coated with was--
Not precious ambergris?
Yes! And I managed to sneak
some out in the usual place.
Using that, I'll make you a perfume
of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry.
Oh, Kif, it's so romantic,
I can't even wait!
I'm gonna wear it right now.
Who smells like freaking porpoise hork?
I do!
Kiss me, Kif.
Oh, what a foolish squid I've been.
I'm not rich. I can't even
buy one measly masterpiece.
Pardon us, gent. Might a couple
of hungry, hungry hoboes...
Take a feed from that
aluminum snack box?
Ah. So now I'm in the gutter,
surrounded by bums who eat garbage?
Money brought me no happiness.
Bupkis.
This boot's got a little
pudding at the bottom.
Interestingly, the Spidarians are more
closely related to our elephants...
Than our spiders.
Don't mind us!
The loot. The loot! The loot is on fire!
Leela, my precious rock dove!
I'll save you!
Everyone, to the fire door!
It's on fire!
We're trapped, my sweet hippopotamus!
Coffee, coffee, coffee!
Where are we, Pops?
What happened to the food?
I think we were saved by
a mysterious orange blur.
Welcome, one and all! I finally figured
out how money could make me happy...
By using it to buy my
hungry friends a feast!
Hooray!
Everyone join us. Oysters Rockefeller
here has provided genuine turkey dogs.
Heck, you're never too rich
to enjoy a free turkey dog.
Yeah!
All right! Turkey dog!
I'll take four.
Me too.
Oh, what the hell.
Here, Dwight.
The boots only cost $299.99.
You invest this penny like you wanted.
Thanks, Dad.
I'm gonna take this and buy
five shares of Amazon.com.
A risk-Taker. That's my boy.
The entire surplus is gone!
Oh, what a McGovern I've been.
Why did I have to issue
that crooked tax rebate?
At least we got a few mildly
interesting stories out of it.
Oh, my, yes.
Speaking of which,
my story kind of petered out...
Without me learning a lesson.
There he is.
All right! Closure!
Stop that! Ow!
"Futurama".
Noun.
I don't know.
You just watched it, dummy.
What are you asking me for?
Hey, here's a fun definition.
"Idiot".
Noun.
You!
This has been Roseanne,
your guide to the world of facts.
Prepare for the stereophonic
experience.
Futurama [5x12] - Spanish Fry - CiWaN
Oh, New New York City!
Whoo! Whoo!
Don't worry about it.
Do the robot, baby!
Oh, Lord. Hiking is always
such a strain on the buttocks.
What was that sound?
It wasn't a bird's nest falling.
That sounds like this:
They're so cute when they're scared.
I meant the sound Bigfoot just made.
He's been sighted in this area recently.
Just last week, a blind hiker felt him.
Don't tell me you actually believe in
Bigfoot, you blathering ninny-Hammer.
Of course I do. Bigfoot's my hero.
Growing up, he was the
celebrity I most identified with.
Why?
Because he was a loner who hated...
The popular monsters
yet longed to be one.
I can so relate to that.
Enough emotions. This isn't
a fat camp, for God's sake.
Although you wouldn't
know it from looking.
Ah.
Bender, if you want to
sleep in the tent tonight...
You're welcome to join me and Hermes
for a little "just friends" spooning.
No, I'm comfy out here under the stars.
Real comfy.
Hi, I'm Ranger Park, the park ranger.
I get it.
Since this is a national
Bigfoot preserve...
We'll start with a short film about
Bigfoot while I make a few phone calls.
Bigfoot. Endangered mystery.
In the dense forests of
the Pacific Northwest...
Dwells the strange and beautiful
creature known as Bigfoot, perhaps.
That proves it.
Sadly, logging and human settlement...
Today threaten what might
possibly be his habitat.
Although if it's not, they don't.
Bigfoot populations require vast
amounts of land to remain elusive in.
They typically dwelljust behind rocks,
but are also sometimes playful...
Bounding into thick fogs
and out-Of-Focus areas.
It should say "Top Quality
Exercycle For Sale. "
And could you put "Top Quality" in bold?
You can't? Okay, whatever.
Remember, it's up to us.
Bigfoot is a crucial part of
the ecosystem, if he exists.
So let's all help keep
Bigfoot possibly alive...
For future generations to enjoy,
unless he doesn't exist.
The end!
I gotta call you back.
All right, questions?
Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?
Technically, no.
But I do see him each
night in my dreams...
And each day in the smiling
faces of hairy children.
Bunk! Bunk, I say! Bring me a bag
full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up.
I have some of someone who saw him.
Shut up.
Oh, my God. Look, it's Bigfoot.
Where?!
Oh, he's gone.
He said you should keep
wasting your life, though.
I saw Bigfoot crushing
cars at the county fair.
What you saw was Bigfoot
the monster truck.
But thanks for a great question.
Sir, if I may? Why don't you just set
up, like, a billion video cameras...
In the woods and see if he walks by one?
Ah. That would be very expensive...
And most people who believe
in Bigfoot are broke.
Hey, look! Bigfoot. He's back.
Where?
Up your face.
Everybody do the Bender.
The sky out here is amazing.
Look at all the satellites.
Good night, employees.
Good night.
Good night, Hubert.
You doing all right out there, buddy?
Better than these gnats.
That guy won't be
going home to his kids.
What's that? A wolf?
Or some kind of boogin?
Oh, God, I wish I was
safe inside a tent.
Fry. Fry, wake up.
It's me, Bigface.
Come out and groom my mangy fur.
Bigfoot? You taught yourself English?
Bigfoot. Bigfoot!
Bigfoot? Ls that you?
I'm not like the others, Bigfoot.
I see through your monster
coating to the gentle loner inside.
I bet you have a
wounded raccoon friend...
That you tenderly nurse
back to health while you go:
In the end, they shoot you,
but you teach us about things.
Oh.
Oh. Just a flying saucer.
Excuse me? You can't park here.
The parking area is over there.
Wow. Nice tube.
Hey. Hey, what's the big idea?
Stop abducting me.
Why does your vanity
plate say "Probe 1 "?
Help!
There's nothing so refreshing...
As the clean, crisp taste
of this bold Canadian beer.
Well, see you in an hour. I got to
go do some business behind that tree.
Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?
"Bender . "
Bender raises a good point.
Where is Fry?
You won't believe what happened.
It was so scary that you wouldn't--
I know. But listen, it gets even scarier.
Fry, what in Sega
Genesis happened to you?
That's what I'm trying
to tell you. See--
Why are you all staring at me like that?
Is there something on my face?
Uh . No.
Someone should tell him.
Tell me what?
Nothing.
Well, I have a lot of experience...
Telling patients bad news,
so let me break it to him gently.
Fry, you have no nose.
Your nose is gone.
You have no nose on your face.
Where it is, I can't say...
But on your face it's not.
What?
I think it's sweet.
You chopped off your nose so you could
look more like your hero: me, Bender.
My God.
They must have taken it last night.
Which last night?
In the woods. I was walking.
For Bigfoot, looking.
And then aliens beamed me up.
Were they little gray
dudes with big oval heads?
I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?
Cheer up, friend. When we get home...
A high-Quality prosthesis
will have you looking good as new.
I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
Man, you are such a jokester.
I'll never have another
moment of happiness.
I know you're trying to mask your
pain with humor, but don't worry.
I'm sure the professor
can clone you a new nose.
It wouldn't be the same.
I want my nose.
I don't want to teach a new one
how to shoot milk when I laugh.
Well, there's no sense fretting.
Good Lord, you're ugly.
The fact is, your nose is gone and we'll
never find out who did it or why.
Guys. Guys. There's
something on television.
Alien abductions.
Until now, a harmless nuisance.
But recently, they've taken
on a sinister dimension...
As unsuspecting victims
are returned without noses.
Like me!
The culprits:
Shameless poachers,
hunting humans without a permit.
The valuable nose, or human horn...
Fetches a high price on alien
worlds as an aphrodisiac.
My nose is an aphrodisiac?
I'm gonna drop a barf.
Demand for human horn is great,
due in part to titillating scenes...
From depraved alien TV programs
too filthy for Earth broadcast.
Let's watch.
Human horn? But it is forbidden.
So is our love.
We have to track down my
nose before some alien...
Snarfs it and does the worm.
Who's in?
Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg,
if he feels like it.
No, I'm good.
Let's see, I'll take a pancreas,
two sphincters and a large Coke.
One number 3 combo.
It's no use. We've been
to every scuzzy bazaar...
In the galaxy, including Pottery Barn.
Wait. What's that?
Welcome, friends.
How may I pervert you?
Uh . I'm looking for human horn.
Shh!
You're not cops, right?
Of course not. In fact, he's a crook.
Yep. Stolen Pez, anyone?
Right this way.
Human horn. So fresh you can
still see the eyeglass marks.
Nope. Uh-Uh. Ew!
Look, this is the nose we want.
Did you sell it to somebody?
I'm sorry, sir, but due to the
perverted nature of our business...
Customer records are
strictly confidential.
Right this way.
I videotape everyone who comes in
here so I can blackmail them later.
Ew!
Hey, I'm a porno-Dealing monster.
What do I care what you think?
Here's the weirdo who bought your horn.
That's Lrrr, ruler of the
planet Omicron Persei 8.
You got any, you know, human horn?
Speak up, you're muttering.
I said.... Human horn?
You're not a cop, right?
Oh, no, no.
I'm just some guy, ruler of
the planet Omicron Persei 8!
So let me get this straight.
If I buy eight Caramello bars,
you all get to go to some camp?
Yep. That's exactly the lie we
used to get past your guards.
Oh, great space king, I humbly
beg you to return my human horn.
Human horn? How ridiculous.
Why would a virile male
like Lrrr need human horn?
I don't even know what it's for.
What is it...
Something you put in salad dressing?
Like you've ever seen a salad.
My weight is appropriate and attractive.
You guys have issues.
She has issues. I'm fine.
But there's no human horn around here,
so make friends with the door.
All right, I give up.
I guess I'll just go
home and marry a skunk.
Oh, let's just give it to him. Here.
My nose! Light of my face!
What is that?
How do you have that, Ndnd?
I've never seen it before.
My friend left it here.
Hold still, Fry. I can reattach
it with my emergency face laser.
Hey, you burned my cheek.
Yeah, sorry, I wasn't
really concentrating.
No, I mean--
The singed flesh, I can smell it.
And those lilacs on the table.
At least someone noticed.
For the last time, I don't like lilacs.
Your first wife was the
one who liked lilacs.
She also liked to shut up.
Well, great seeing you. We'll be on our--
Yo, Highness.
Just out of robo-Curiosity,
why would you use a guy's nose...
For an aphrodisiac instead
of his, you know, wing-Dang-Doodle?
But I thought the horn was
the human wing-Dang-Doodle.
No sir, chief. The main event, so to
speak, is downstairs near the wallet.
Ever seen soccer players
line up to block a free kick?
They ain't covering their noses,
I'll tell you that much. Well, see you.
Interesting. The trousers
conceal a tiny secondary horn.
Hey, what have you heard?
Guards, seize him.
Prepare to harvest the lower horn.
Okay, you can have my nose.
Guards.
Yeah?
Remove the human's lower horn
and prepare it to be eaten by me.
In other words, slop a lot
of ketchup and salt on it.
Then bring it to our royal bedchamber
and put it in the sock drawer...
With the other things that have failed
to arouse my passion for this woman.
Remove pants.
Wait. Listen...
I'm usually the first
guy to toot my own horn--
I'll say! Whoo!
But in this case I don't
think it's gonna do any good.
That's what she said! Whoo!
Let's face it. You two have
deep relationship problems...
That can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.
However huge it might be.
So, what do you suggest,
painfully single human?
Why don't you think back to what
brought you together in the first place?
Oh, I don't know.
Lrrr used to be so tender.
I only wrote that poem
to test my printer.
We'd go walking in the woods...
And Lrrr would find injured tinkle
bunnies and nurse them back to health.
Yes, but I'm the one who injured them.
Oh, shush.
You stepped on them by accident
and then you cried all night.
That's the kind of
sensitive man you used to be.
And you used to wear a size 3
cape, but not anymore!
Now, bring me that lower horn
while I'm still in the mood!
What if we got your passion
back without mutilating me?
Yeah. We know a great
place in the mountains.
We could take you there for a
romantic dinner under the stars.
Sounds interesting.
But he would never do it.
Oh, like hell I wouldn't.
I'm not gonna be blamed for not going.
Then it's a deal. We get one night.
I keep my horn as long as you two end
up doing the horizontal monster mash.
Oh! I don't get it.
Bonjour. May I offer you a box
of wine for the edge of the table?
No, thanks. Just water, please.
Tap water.
Oh, big spender.
That's it. This date is over. Waiter.
So, what can I get you this evening?
Your lower horn.
I'll just start you off with some bread.
Some sexy, arousing bread.
Fine. But none of that
whole-Grain goat food.
And bring plenty of melted butter.
Why don't you just inject some fat...
Straight into your ass
and cut out the middleman?
One of these days, Ndnd.
Bang. Zoom. Straight to the
third moon of Omicron Persei 8.
Mmm. This jerked chicken is good.
I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked.
It's used to it! Whoo!
So how are you two
snoogy-Pookums doing?
Poorly.
My wife is right, for once.
There's very little magic in the air.
Ready the lower horn transport vessel.
Boy, who knew a cooler could
also make a handy wang coffin.
Hey, mind if I stick these in here?
Go for it.
Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad,
but I still have a trump card.
The most beautiful
love song ever written.
The humans are attacking!
Pluck the lower horn and
let's get out of here!
Quick, Fry, run for it.
Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah!
Come on, freedom cage.
Roll me to safety!
Ow! Ow!
Yes! I never thought I'd escape
with my doodle, but I pulled it out.
Just like at the movie theater! Whoo!
Give me that.
Bigfoot! He's real. I knew it.
The Loch Ness monster's book was right.
Well, hello there, my furry friend.
Look at his adorable little feet.
Yes, you are a cutie pie.
Holy macaroni!
I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot.
And he's in focus.
Oh, I've waited my entire
life for this moment.
What?
What are you doing with that?
You're going to kill
this innocent giganto?
Of course not. I'm just
gonna tranquilize him...
So I can chop off his
feet as proof he exists...
Then dump him back in
the wild. He'll do fine.
You'll have to get through me first.
Okay. Nighty-Night.
Ah!
Now, leave this gentle Sasquatch,
or Wood Ape, in peace...
So I can finally and at long last
harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.
Yeah!
Wait. What am I saying?
If I poach this beast's
lower horn, am I any better...
Than that ranger with
his demented foot lust?
Yes, but not by enough.
Score.
This human's lower horn
is one of God's creatures.
A living thing. And all living
things, large and small--
In this case, small! Whoo!
Have dignity and a spark of the divine.
That's the gentle, sensitive
poet warlord I fell in love with.
Oh, yeah
You'll want to retreat to
a safe, 500-Meter radius.
Well, Fry, it looks like you get
to hold on to your lower horn.
As usual! Whoo!
Run away!
There, right there, right there.
Oh, yeah.
You're on a scenic route through
a state recreation area...
Known as the human mind.
You ask a passerby for directions...
Only to find he has
no face or something.
Suddenly up ahead, a door in the road.
You swerve, narrowly
avoiding The Scary Door.
I have combined the DNA of the
world's most evil animals...
To make the most evil
creature of them all.
It turns out it's man.
Futurama [5x13] - Bend Her - CiWaN
Welcome to the games of
the 3004 Earth Olympiad!
Continuing this network's tradition
of sportscasting excellence.
Celebrity Ape Fight will return
next week at its regular time.
Who should I root for? America?
Or a country I learned
about at the food court?
How about those guys?
No. They're from the Republic
of French Stereotypes.
Everybody hates them.
Oh. Let's go check on Hermes.
All this inspiring multiculturalism
is angrying up my blood!
Sweden? I don't think so.
Go on, stick, touch me. Can't do it.
Husband! You haven't been an
Olympic-Class limbo-Er for 20 years!
Quit lying to your pudgy self.
It seems like Jamaica would be able to
field a strong limbo team without you.
Yeah. Isn't that
basically all Jamaicans do?
Jamaicans have other interests!
Which is why the limbo team
got detained at the airport.
That's when they begged my husband to
step in and make an ass out of himself.
And I said I'd try my very best.
But have they seen your, you know,
physique since the old days?
I described it to them on the phone
using a series of artful euphemisms.
Don't worry. The fat pig will do fine...
Thanks to this Flabbo-Dynamic
Spandex Body Suit I've designed.
It redistributes his weight, shifting
his center of gravity closer to his knees.
Ooh, that's snug. Oh!
Those haven't descended in years!
Now, that's a limbo-Er's body!
Look at that fine Jamaican bacon!
Shut up, Zoidberg!
The robot bending events are starting.
Something tells me I could easily
beat those trained professionals.
Wow! That guy must be, like,
the world's greatest bender!
My dreams of glory
died before they began.
Welcome to my life.
Athletes, please take your lanes...
For the Men 's 500 Meter Limbo.
Hermes Conrad, is that you
inside that dumpy little fat man?
Barbados Slim!
What are you doing here?
Last time I heard, you were in Barbados.
Yes, and I'll be going back there...
With a gold medal draped around
my elegant Caribbean shoulders.
Your body may be as perfectly
sculpted as it was 20 years ago...
When you whupped my fat ass
every time.
But today, I feel lucky.
I see you're still able to limbo
under the bar of fashion sense.
That's it, Barbados Slim!
You've gone one toke over the line!
Limbo-Ers, on your marks.
Get rubbery. Limbo!
There they go!
And Barbados Slim takes an early lead.
God, I hope he wins.
What's this?
Hermes Conrad is closing the gap.
He's limboed out of retirement
and straight into my heart.
I say, "Go to hell, Barbados Slim!"
Go, body suit! Go!
Come on!
Come on, Hermes!
Beat that mahogany god!
It's Barbados, then Conrad.
Conrad pulls ahead.
And Conrad is disqualified!
Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!
Oh, there, there, Hermes.
You did your best.
If I'd wanted a human
adonis for a husband...
I'd have stayed married
to Barbados Slim.
Well, enough about Hermes.
I couldn't win a medal either.
Even at bending,
the thing I was built to do.
I'm so embarrassed.
I wish everybody else was dead.
Up next, the Fem-Bot
Bending Competition.
Fem-Bots?
Methinks a clever man-Bot,
suitably disguised...
Might win those events.
But the charade would require
subtlety, nuance, grace.
What do you mean I'm not registered?
My name is Coilette,
and I'm from Robonia.
Coilette's a chick's name.
Yes.
But "Robonia" sounds like something
somebody made up on the spot.
Ever been beaten up by a
guy dressed like a chick?
Yeah.
And it's straight! Coilette wins!
Another gold medal for the
spunky maid from Robonia!
A perfect bend and a flawless entry.
No splash at all!
Perfect scores!
A record five gold medals for Coilette!
I'm great! Everybody else sucks!
Except that guy Bender.
He's really something.
All medalists report for gender testing.
You actually thought they'd let you walk
away without an engine-Oil sex check?
Oh, God! I'm not gonna get my medals!
They're all I have to
remember my Olympic career!
Wait! I've got it!
Professor, make a woman out of me!
Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
I don't need friends! I need a sex-Change
operation, and give it to me now!
Bender, a robot sex change is a
complex and dangerous procedure.
Replacing your testoster-Oil
with fem-Bot lubricants...
Can cause wild mood swings.
And the effects may be irreversible.
Well, let's get started.
No! You can't!
If you have even the slightest
respect for the dignity of women--
Pfft.
I'm sorry, ladies, but I must do this.
Not for you. Not for Bender.
But for the proud people of Robonia!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
I can't watch this 'cause
it's creepy and wrong and sick.
However, I will watch out of curiosity.
Quiet!
I'm about to begin the process
of reshaping Bender's body...
Into a tender, delicate form.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Hey!
Draining male oil.
Infusing female oil.
Removing item.
We can't wait for Coilette any longer!
I have to get home to
watch The Zombie Osbournes.
I'm ready for my test now, boys.
Hail, hail Robonia...
A land I didn 't make up...
Yeah, come on, baby. Take that.
Goodness.
Oh, yeah, baby. Come on.
Work your cans. Now, shake it out.
I don't know which I'm more:
enraged or disgusted.
I'm just out there making
us ladies look good.
Snuh-Uh. You're making us look like
jerks in front of the other genders!
You're not really a lady anyway, right?
Of course not.
Dear Lord, a coaster!
The Femmzoil must be sashaying
girlishly into your processor.
Then change me back. My breasts are
keeping me awake at night anyway.
Hello? What?
A guest spot on Late
Night With Humorbot 5.0?
I'd love to! My own limo?
No, I don't have my own limo.
You'd better send one.
I need a rain check on
that nad swap, professor.
I'm going on TV. Come on, Fry.
Help me pick out a pantsuit.
So, Calculon, do you want to set
up this clip from All My Circuits?
No, I think it's self-Explanatory.
No!
Funny story.
The script called for me to say "yes. "
But I gave it a little twist.
Anecdote accepted.
Snappy comeback not found.
Please put your hands
together for my next guest...
Winner of five Olympic medals,
Coilette from Robonia.
So, Coilette, many young
fem-Bots wish to emulate you.
Any advice for them?
Yes, Humorbot.
If you ask me, women
today are too stuck-Up...
To go out and jiggle their Jell-O
like everybody wants them to.
In fact, should I do it now?
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
All right, then.
Look out, baby! Good. Work it out.
Oh, shake that thing.
You got to use it, lady.
Shake it up a little.
That's right. Come on. Work it out.
Madam, I am one impressed celebrity.
Oh, I bet you say that to all the five-
Olympic-Gold-Medal-Winning fem-Bots.
From this day forth,
I shall do so whenever possible.
Golly! What?
Coilette, this may be presumptuous
That's my favorite kind of "this. "
But I would be honored if you
would join me for dinner sometime.
Woo .
Calculon, you'd be fulfilling this
naive Robonian farm girl's fantasy.
Of course I would.
This top makes me look fat.
Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
Yes!
Perfect!
You've gotta tell me. You're not
actually attracted to Calculon, right?
And if you are, don't tell me. Are you?
Certainly not.
But just once I'd like to eat dinner with
a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
Is that so much to ask?
I think you dating a
man-Bot is a disgrace.
And I refuse to be involved.
And you have way too much lipstick on.
Are you kidding? I need more lipstick!
Much more!
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Men love it when you really glob it on.
No, they don't!
No way!
Oh, please! Every man wants a tramp.
No wonder you girls aren't married.
I tell you, men are so
much better at being women.
But what if he wants to--?
I mean, if he tries to--?
Barry White?
I'll tell him I need a commitment first.
That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe.
Good Lord, man!
What kind of temporary woman are you?
Look, why don't all
of you just back off?
Can't a girl enjoy herself
without being judged?
Oh, dear!
Her mood swings are getting wilder.
She's becoming a slave to her emotions.
Just like all women.
Particularly you, Leela.
I'm worried about him too, professor.
Hey, ma'am, you sure can put it away.
You saved me a trip to the dump. Bam!
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't "bam" the young lady.
Well, I'd appreciate it if I did,
so I guess we're even.
You know, Coilette, I've never before
met a woman as fascinating as I am.
You're such a sweet, soft fem-Bot,
yet you have this free spirit about you.
And there it is. It's as if you
understand the male mind better than l.
I've never met anyone like you.
Oh, yes, you have.
Coilette, I'd like to spend
some quality time with you.
What? Oh, no way! Not gonna happen!
What kind of girl do you think I am?
Have I mentioned that I own the
world's biggest and most elegant yacht?
Whoo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!
No kidding.
These gifts have been coming nonstop.
I think Calculon's falling for you.
Ah, any day now he'll dump
me for a new wad of arm candy.
And then I can turn back into a guy and
hock all this stuff. It's just a game.
Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you.
I can't sleep at night!
Although, as a robot,
I don't do that anyway.
But if I did, I couldn't
because I love you so.
Oh, my darling.
Will you marry me?
Oh, Calculon. Yes, I will!
Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
I'll miss you. You've been like
a brother and then a sister to me.
And now you're getting married.
I love you, man.
The marriage is a scam.
Cool. What's for dinner?
What do you mean, a scam?
I marry Calculon, divorce him...
Take half his money and
turn back into a guy.
It's sort of a
two-Person pyramid scheme.
That's marriage, all right.
That is so unbelievably manipulative!
You never went on a date with a
guy just 'cause you were hungry?
I, uh. I thought I might
like him on a full stomach.
Nice try, sister.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to meet with my wedding planner.
Zoidberg?
Zoidy-Poo?
Please tell me frilly is in this year.
I saw a frilly cake in here you
would remember all your life.
I know I will.
Late at night it taunts
me with its frosted beauty.
Order the cake, damn it!
I have something for you.
A remote control? You got me a TV?
No, my dearest.
It's the remote control to my heart.
It symbolizes the power you
have to sway my emotions.
Will it work on my TV?
We don't need TVs.
We have each other.
Coilette, if I weren't able
to spend my life with you...
I would leap from this very balloon.
Come on with that. Really?
Yes.
We were meant to be.
So you really and truly love me?
So much so that I'm prepared to give
up show business itself to be with you.
But you always said you'd
rather burn down a convent...
Than give up show business.
I always said many things.
But now all I want is a peaceful life in
a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard...
With you.
Would we have donkeys?
All you could eat.
Oh, take me in your arms and
compress me! Compress me tight!
Stop! Let us climb to the heavens...
That the gods themselves might envy us!
I just don't think I can
go through with this scam.
What?
So now you do want to marry him?
No. I just don't want to
hurt him or humiliate him.
Oh, curse this woman's heart!
Ick.
You're falling into the final
debilitating stages of womanhood!
You've waited too long to
switch back, you dingbat!
Okay, look, if I help you with this...
Do you promise to get out
of my gender and stay out?
Uh-Huh.
All right. Now, there's no way to stop
this marriage without hurting Calculon.
But he's an actor. If there's
one kind of pain he can handle...
It's soap opera pain.
Okay, is everyone ready?
Yep!
Check.
Basically.
Dearly beloved actors
and casting people...
Who might be looking for
someone to play a preacher...
I welcome you!
The bride has written some vows...
That we will now all
pretend to be interested in.
Dearest Calculon,
forever is not enough time...
To tell you of the many ways I love you.
Oh, my!
Is there a doctor in--?
I came as soon as I could.
Oh, it appears to be a case
of African hydraulic fever!
Dear God! The very illness my TV
character caught in season two...
When I was holding out for
more money. It's often fatal.
Whatever happens, remember:
The flame of my eternal
love will burn forever.
Of course. But, smoochy-Pops, I thought
one could only catch hydraulic fever...
Deep in the diamond mines of the Congo.
Coilette! You she-Devil!
You really thought you could steal
those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?
Those gems belong to the natives!
Hee-Ya!
Oh, how cruel and melodramatic fate is!
Why?
Calculon, my darling, your loud "why"
brought me partway back to life.
Congo Jack!
Another shocking twist!
Yes! And I have a message
for you from Col. Matombay.
He says, "This is from Congo Jack. "
Uh, um .
No. No!
N-O-O-O!
I won't leave you.
Not until I'm sure you understand
the thing I said before...
About my eternal love for you burning.
Et cetera.
I do.
I do.
Okay, then.
I'm a doctor. She's dead.
She lives no more.
But let us all find comfort,
knowing that she truly loved me.
To honor my pain, I shall star
in a film dedicated to her memory.
And this time,
the Academy will not deny me.
Not when they see Coilette:
The Calculon Story.
Coilette, your death fills
me with sorrow, anger, fear.
Every emotion an actor can display.
Turn off that crap-O-Rama!
One mistake and Bender
will be trapped forever...
Between the already
ill-Defined robot sexes.
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ah!
I hope this taught you a lesson about
changing your sex to win gold medals.
It truly has.
My romance with Calculon has
shown me a lot about myself.
Almost done.
If only somehow, some way...
He and I could drive to Vegas,
pick up some floozy-Bots...
And void their warranties
all night long! Whoo!
Yay! My buddy's home! And his
respect for women is back to normal.
I hoped this experience would have left
you more open to your sensitive side.
Yeah, you'd think,
but what you gonna do?
Coilette, the skies themselves weep...
Upon the sweetest
flower of all the field.
Ew.
Blech.
Sentimental dribble poop!
Come on, Bender, let's go.
This chick flick is
getting me all barfy. Yeah.
Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
Good night forever, my turtledove.
Good night, Calculon.
What did you say?
I said, "You two don't
dress trampy enough! "
I still got it.
Futurama [5x14] - Obsoletely Fabulous - CiWaN
Ten dollars, please.
Oh, man!
Sleep, little dumpling.
I have replaced your mother.
Aw.
Oh, my God! Robot dealy-Boppers!
And there's a robot scratching post!
You should try it out, Bender.
Please. I have some dignity.
Ladies and gentlemen, my Killbot
features Lotus Notes and a machine gun.
It is the finest available.
Like fun it is, you glass-Headed wallaby!
No one calls me that! I'm having at you!
Wernstrom!
Such senseless aggression.
Come on. Let's go for a paddleboat ride.
The secret was scratching
really, really hard.
And now, the woman who
mom-Opolizes the robot industry...
I get it!
...Mom!
Oh, now I get it!
Hello, dearies.
I love that old bat!
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the 17th year in a row...
The future of robotics has arrived.
Boys.
I give you Robot 1-X.
Ow.
Ow! Oh.
Neat.
Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put
all my previous models to shame.
Incidentally, would one of my
previous models mind coming up here?
Here! I'm coming!
Come on, baby! I'm yours!
Come on, Mom!
Jerk!
Here we go.
I'm your top of the line, Mom!
Notice that this obsolete robot
runs on alcohol and emits pollution.
Whereas Robot 1-X runs on
pollution and emits pure oxygen...
With a fresh pine scent.
Man, that smells great!
Now let's see how both robots
do at a typical household task:
Sorting a jar of pocket change.
Task completed.
Total value $4.73 and one Albanian lek.
Very good, Robot 1-X.
And you, bending unit?
I never got the change.
Suckers.
Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots.
That new robot is great, huh?
He sure made me look like a pile of crap.
Indeed. That's why I bought
one to help around the office.
Let's try him out. Robot 1-X,
can you clean Nibbler's stanky litter box?
I can, and will.
Hey, I could have done
that if you'd ask me.
I asked you five minutes ago.
You call that a kiss? I'll show you!
Come here, Nibbler!
Look, Bender. If you want something to
do, stop making out and give us a hand.
Go up on the roof and install
this fake satellite dish...
So we can impress the neighbors.
Yes, sir! I'm on it.
Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you.
God!
Get out of here, freshman!
I don't need your help!
Our owners asked me to assist you.
Yeah? Well, assist this!
Whoa! Ah! Help!
When I screamed "Help,"
I didn't mean you!
I apologize. However, I was able to
do your job before I saved your life.
Don't mind me. I'm just saving you
the trouble of throwing me away.
Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV.
I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.
Never!
Why can't you accept his help?
I hate him!
But he's just a tool to
make your life easier.
Like a socket wrench, or a burglar's kit.
I can't ask for his help because...
Yes?
I'm scared of him.
Oh, sorry.
Well, then, there's only one solution.
You need an upgrade to
make you compatible...
With Robot 1-X's new technology.
An upgrade? But I thought
we all agreed I was perfect.
Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?
Oh, yeah. No, you're pretty perfect.
"Pretty perfect"?
So you do think I need an upgrade.
Yes, for God's sakes, yes!
Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
Man, I hate those new 1-X robots.
I'd like to stab them!
Give them some of these!
Yeah, right on, nut cake.
Parole officer says I gotta upgrade,
or he won't give me back my stabbing knife.
But it's no big.
I hate those 1-X so much.
I know it won't affect me.
Death to the 1-X Robots!
I love those magnificent 1-X Robots!
The 1-X Robots are my friends.
Wait. What happened to your
enthusiasm for stabbing them?
I'm past that. Later, blood.
It's like he's not him anymore.
You took away his robo-Humanity!
I changed my mind!
Yeah. I did it! I escaped.
But to what kind of a life?
I'm too scared to get the upgrade...
But I can't face my
friends again without it.
And so, I set sail for unknown shores.
Oh, merciful Poseidon,
take pity on this mechanical mariner.
Oh, jeez.
Whoa! Whoa! Oh, uh. Whoa!
Curse you, merciful Poseidon!
Boy, what is the deal with the ocean?
A tropical island, huh?
Well, I've washed up in worse places.
Okay, first up, I'm gonna
need to build a shelter.
There.
Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.
Damn. One rock short of rescue.
Low on power.
Better fuel up.
Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do
when I run out of booze.
Okay, don't panic.
I've got these yams.
I'll just make some yam schnapps.
Hmm.
Hey, I should be mad at you.
Now, turn around.
Funny now hot.
Beer!
Ow!
Oh . Numb. Oh.
Who is it?
Ow!
Who are you, and why should I care?
Side A. We're a community of outdated
robots who refused to upgrade...
And came here-- Side B.
To live a simpler existence,
free of technology.
A working cartridge unit? Wow.
You guys went obsolete years ago.
Your mother.
What Cartridge Unit means is,
the things that make us obsolete...
Also make us unique.
I, for example, need to keep
refilling my waterwheel...
Or I'll power-Down forever.
Oh, God! I'll never make it this time!
This is the end!
Anyway, we like it here.
Like you have a choice.
So, what's your problem?
Not enough .
Memory?
Oh, great.
Now I remember that word,
but I forgot my wife's face.
Oh, God! No! I want to live!
If you'd like, you're
welcome to join our society.
Look, no offense, but I need technology,
especially e-Mail and snowmobiles.
And television. Without television,
how will I know what's buzz-Worthy?
Why would you want to watch TV when
you can watch a snail crawl for hours?
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.
Oh, man! He's never gonna
make it over that pebble!
Wait! Wait! Oh, my God! He made it!
Yeah! Way to go!
That was the greatest thing ever!
Let's party.
Yeah, baby! Come on!
Where did you get that CD?
It's one of my 10 desert-Island disks.
I never really thought I'd use them,
but look at me now.
Oh, yeah, baby! Gonna do that dance .
CDs are unnatural.
Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
Which ocean? That ocean?
Wow. It's like the Earth making
sweet, salty love to itself...
While all the fish groove on it.
So much for this garbage.
Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!
Bang, bang, bang.
You sure got this life thing figured out,
cymbal-Banging monkey.
Hi, Bender. We know how
much you miss technology...
So we brought you this washing
machine that drifted ashore.
I'm gonna wash my
linens so hard, the--
You .
What? I don't understand.
Wretched technology has
brought me nothing but misery.
But Bender, you are technology.
You're the most advanced
thing on this entire island.
Oh, it's true. I am a hideous
triumph of form and function.
But not for long!
Oh! That hurt!
The downgrade is complete!
Behold my handcrafted purity.
The modern world can bite
my splintery wooden ass!
Ah.
Welcome to your new life
of simple tranquility.
Forget that! I say the whole world
must learn of our peaceful ways!
By force!
What?
We're going back to civilization...
To wage war on technology!
What?
Row, comrades, row!
We'll stage an attack on technology...
Worthy of being chronicled
in an anthem by Rush.
We've been sailing for three weeks.
Maybe I should check our
position with the periscope.
Aye, up!
Mirrors reflecting mirrors?
High-Tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!
Did you see anything?
Yep, we're there.
Prepare to surface!
And now, technology shall taste
the lash of the hickory switch!
Technology is defeated!
Let us return to the island
and celebrate by counting rocks!
Yeah!
Whoa! Whoa! No one wants to
count rocks more than me...
But our mission is not complete.
Not so long as Robot 1-X torments
me with his obvious superiority.
Ready the catapult, Sinclair!
Aim for their power lines!
They're the devil's veins,
and electricity is his blood!
Bender? If we don't survive the attack,
I want you to know I love you.
Okay, fine. Fire!
Oh! I'm blind!
Professor, we have no power!
What do you mean, "no power"?
We're living in the future!
I'd better light some candles.
Friends, I've come to free you
from your complicated lives!
Free you from the "complicated" part,
I mean, not the "Iives" part.
Oh, Lord, he's made of wood.
What now, Bender?
I got a downgrade.
I'm a steam-Powered wooden robot,
just as nature intended.
Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X!
That's just stupid!
Does Mr. Bender wish
me to destroy myself?
I don't need your charity.
Target Robot 1-X and fire!
You wanged my ship,
you walnut-Paneled idiot!
Try again, Sinclair.
I said target Robot 1-X.
Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.
So I guess everything worked out fine.
Great. Now we're being crushed.
Help us, wooden Bender!
Those guys hate fire!
I gotta do something!
What the--? Termites?
Well, I don't need
legs to save my friends.
I'll just use the old
extenso-Matic arms.
Bender! Hurry! This fuel is expensive!
Also, we're dying!
I'm a-Coming!
Ow! Lousy primitive body!
Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade?
I'm an outdated piece of junk.
Sir, might I recommend--?
You shut up!
No, wait. I can use you as
a tool to save my friends.
And I'll still be the hero,
who everyone says how great he was.
How may I help you?
Save my friends! And Zoidberg!
Look! My hair got singed
into an even cuter 'do.
Hey, where's Bender?
Down here.
I'm so sorry, guys.
I never meant to hurt you...
Just to destroy everything
you ever believed in.
Well, at least you saved us from...
Uh, you.
Thank God you finally overcame
your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.
Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync.
I was like, "Save them! " And he was all,
"No problem. " And then he did it.
His new technology is great.
I love those magnificent 1-X Robots.
The 1-X Robots are my friends.
It's like his personality
is totally different now.
Oh, maybe this upgrade
isn't such a good idea.
I'd like to give Robot
1-X a big smooch on the--
Hey, what's the dealy-O?
Your upgrade is complete.
But I destroyed the
technology of the world.
I ran on the beach and felt
the sand between my foot-Cups.
Everyone experiences
the upgrade differently.
If that stuff wasn't real,
how can I be sure anything is real?
Is it not possible, nay, probable...
That my whole life is just a product
of my, or someone else's imagination?
No. Get out. Next?
Well, I guess reality
is what you make of it.
Yep. Oh, thanks, baby.
Futurama [5x15] - Bender Should Not Be Allowed On TV - CiWaN
Oh, my.
Here we go, y'all!
Zoidberg, Zoidberg. Zoidberg.
This is a story about all my friends.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Previously on All My Circuits:
I'm sorry, Father. But somewhere along
the way, I forgot how to be your son.
Why, Antonio?
Because I have amnesia!
Calculon! But I thought you were--
Egyptian?
Before I kill you,
I must ask you one question:
Who am l?
For I have Amnesia!
Let me get this straight.
Does anyone here not have amnesia?
Not sure.
I don't know.
This show is awesome! When I grow
up, I'm gonna have so much amnesia.
Me too! I mean, I have it now.
But I forgot.
Well, mine's louder!
Cram a ham in it, you twerps!
Sorry.
I had it coming.
Welcome, swingers!
Pull up a groove and get fabulous!
Nude rock bands, big piles of
what I assume is talcum powder.
It's quite a birthday party, Calculon.
Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious
birthday party just like Calculon!
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna show
up looking good just like Monique.
Do you two have to imitate
everything you see on TV?
We're 12. So, yes.
Hold up, Cubert.
You're a clone of the professor.
Do clones even have birthdays?
Duh.
Duh what?
Dad? Do I have a birthday?
Hmm. You didn't have a birth,
so technically, no.
Hmm.
Oh, don't feel bad.
We can celebrate the day I
extracted you from the cloning tank.
Or the day I scraped your DNA
from that growth on my back.
That one!
Yes.
It was 13 years ago next week.
I used this very fork.
Oh, well, isn't that--
Hey. Next week'll be my birthday too!
That's true! Lf only there were a way
to have one party for both of you...
Here at the office, then write
it off as a business expense.
Wait! I thought of a way!
The way I just said!
Yeah!
Way to go, Pops!
Something's happening on television!
Oh, Monique. Why did we wait so
many years to bathe in champagne?
Father! I've discovered
the shocking secret...
Mother has kept from you for 200 years!
No! No!
Brace yourself, for when
I speak these words...
You may well suffer an
attack of explosive amnesia!
For you see, the horrible secret is--
Whoever's directing this
is a master of suspense!
He's busteds.
Let's get hims out of heres.
We now join America 's most
popular show in progress:
Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad!
This show's been going
downhill since season three.
Look who's here, everyone!
It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!
Since when are you performing
at children's parties?
Performing? What? Please, if someone
could spare me money to buy shoes?
This party pukes.
Yeah!
The guests were supposed
to be here three hours ago.
Well, that doesn't mean that no one is
coming or that you two are total losers.
Who gave you that idea?
All right! They must've
all come as a group!
Welcome, swingers!
Pull up a groove and get fabulous!
Huh?
Good day, fellows. Someone dumped
this invitation in my begging cup.
Happy growth-Scraping day to all!
Fire them all.
Guys. Guys. Something's
happening on television again!
Welcome to Entertainment
and Earth lnvasion Tonite.
Across the galaxy my people are
completing a mighty space fleet...
That will exterminate the human race!
But first, this news from Tinsel Town.
Following Antonio Calculon
Jr.'s breakdown on the set...
The popular TV show All My Circuits
will hold an open casting call...
For child robots to replace him.
An open casting call for child robots?
Tinny Tim! Are you
thinking what I'm thinking?
What's that, sir?
That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!
You raised my hopes and dashed
them quite expertly, sir. Bravo!
Bender, your swarthy Latin
charm will only get you so far.
There's a lot of famous
child acting units here.
Look, there's Macaulay Culkon!
He's just not cute
since he got puberty installed.
There's that robot child actor who grew
up and robbed the convenience store.
And there's that robot
child actor who grew up...
And became a convenience store.
Lottery ticket, please.
We're ready for the first audition.
"Emote-Atron Jr. "?
Hold on, precious. Let's make
you look nice for the lady.
What's this? What did I tell you?
No more hanging wires!
In this scene, you've just
found out your real father...
Is Calculon's fourth evil identical
septuplet, Sleazy Martinez.
Okay? Take us there!
Now that I know the truth,
Father, I must ride south
And join the robo-Bandidos at Veracruz!
Boo! Boo! This kid sucks!
We want Bender! Boo!
Well, I thought he was good, but the
audience seems to have turned on him.
But I don't think--
Next!
At Veracruz. So if you'll
kindly hand me my poncho--
Boo! Bring on Bender!
Boo! Bender's the greatest!
Sorry, kid. You're flailing up there.
Ninety actors and they all got booed.
I just wish we could get this
Bender I keep hearing about.
They say he's the greatest.
Well, there is a robot named Bender
here, but he's much too old for--
Send him in forthwith!
Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
Mr. Bender?
Have you ever been on TV before?
Once, when I took those hostages.
I saw that. You were good.
Let's hear you audition.
"Bandidos"? Oh, this is great.
Because I happen to have
a flawless Spanish accent.
I will see. Adiós, Padre. Come, Jesus,
my faithful chihuahua.
Tonight we eat guacamole by the EI Rio!
That was so terrible I
think you gave me cancer!
I don't care how popular you are,
you will never work on my show!
Yay, Bender!
We demand Bender!
However, you've got the job.
Welcome aboard, son!
Father-O!
I'd like you to meet our director,
whose name I never learned.
Yo. I read the script, and I think it
would help my character's motivation
If he was on fire.
Don't worry about the script, baby.
We rewrote your part to
suit your acting abilities.
So now my character
has a British accent?
No, now your character's in a coma.
Get in bed and don't move.
And action!
Stupid dumb coma.
I could've been British.
Alas that mine only son should sink
into an irreversible, permanent...
Coma.
Permanent? That's completely out of
character for Antonio. I'm getting up.
Curse the tragic
wildebeest accident that--
Hey, everyone! Antonio here,
but you can call me Bender!
I got ants in my butt and I
needs to strut! Come on, baby!
Come on!
I'm not familiar with the
type of thing I'm seeing.
Bite my shiny metal ass! Yeah!
Come on, baby, yeah.
Come on, yeah!
Cut! That's the worst coma acting I've
ever seen. We'll have to shoot it again.
No. No, no, no.
I don't do two takes.
But this guy was--
Amateurs like you do two takes.
I do one take.
Print it. I'll be in my three-Story trailer.
Bite my shiny metal ass! Yeah!
Come on, baby, yeah! Come on, yeah!
Now, that's hospital dancing!
Pretty good, hey, Calcy?
Good? I've seen better acting
from extras in Godzilla movies.
I didn't shoot this.
We didn't. That's security camera
footage from your dressing room.
He stole the scene and my money?
That's it!
I demand you fire this felonious ham!
The network execu-Bots are coming!
Oh, dear God!
Presenting the president of the network!
Greetings, gentlemen.
You already know my execu-Bots.
Executive Alpha, programmed to
like things it has seen before.
Hey, hey, hey.
Executive Beta.
Programmed to roll dice to
determine the fall schedule.
More reality shows!
And Executive Gamma, programmed
to underestimate Middle America.
It's funny, but is it going
to get them off their tractors?
Now, who put this obnoxious
dancing robot on my network?
We were about to fire him, sir.
Silence, hack!
We've been monitoring our
Nielsen families carefully.
And during the 12 seconds Bender was
on-Screen, viewer eyeball focus...
Was up 90 percent!
But, sir, children watch this show.
Bender's no role model.
He's a filthmonger.
At our network, we love filth.
Filthy rich, that is.
Being filthy rich, that is.
"Bite my shiny metal ass"
could be a catchphrase.
Eighty percent likely.
It will play in Peoria.
Game shows are back!
We need this edgy, sweeps-Ready
robot on our network!
Bender, can you continue to drink,
smoke and steal things on TV?
Yes, I can.
Yeah, shooting!
All right!
Yo. Check out what I jacked from my dad.
A cigar?!
Ripping!
Look. I'm Bender!
Ras H. Tafari!
What's going on here?
The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
That's not a cigar!
And it's not mine.
Hey, Dad. Bite my shiny metal ass!
What? Such an act would be most
uncomfortable for both of us!
Where did you learn such language?
From Bender, my good jerkwad.
Bender? That guy's really
starting to twist my dreads.
Okay, okay! Get ready for this part!
Quiet, robot. Bender's on TV.
Oh, Calculon. It's so good
to get away from the city...
And that beastly yet intriguing Bender.
And try this, kids at home!
Is television sensation Bender a
bad role model for Earth 's children?
That's crazy.
A new protest group, Fathers Against
Rude Television, says "Hell, yes!"
What kind of bozos would
start a Bender protest group?
Good news, everyone! Hermes and I
have started a Bender protest group!
That was uncanny.
Fathers Against Rude Television don't
want our kids watching Bender's...
High-Definition filth!
And for what?
Some kind of cheap laugh?
That's not what F.A.R.T. is all about.
No, sir! Not us F.A.R.T.Ers!
You can't censor me just because
I'm an obscenely bad role model.
As unclean as it makes me feel,
I agree with Bender.
Kids don't turn rotten
just from watching TV.
Yeah. Give a little credit
to our public schools.
Our dads are all pumped
up on dork-Osterone.
We're just trying to be cool, like Bender.
Yeah. And it's not even working.
Smoking and drinking make us barf.
Gentle jerkwads
I know how to emulate Bender without
barfing. We could commit a burglary.
Hey, yeah!
Bender loves to burgle!
Hold up, though. Who could we rob?
We don't know anyone with cool stuff.
Duh. We know someone who runs
on pure cool fuel: Bender!
Whoa!
We'll rob Bender!
TV gave us the idea!
You're watching Futurama
The show that does not advocate
the cool crime of robbery.
Okay. It's crime time.
Hey, Bender.
Hey, Bender.
Hey, Bender.
Hey, Bender.
Oh!
What's going on in here?
Oh. Now I'm really outraged!
Where did you requisition this party?
And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?
I'm networking.
Let me give you my card.
Relax, Dad.
We just invited a few friends over.
There's something wrong with your
story, but I can't put my finger on it.
Of course! You don't have friends!
Yeah! Why do these popular kids
consider you cool all of a sudden?
We're just cool, is all.
Balderdash!
I'll be the judge of who's cool,
using the Cool-O-Meter!
Oh, yeah!
Good Lord! I'm getting a
reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies.
Everybody out!
Aw
So do you guys know about
anything else going on?
Because I'm totally
still ready to party.
There's enough cool stuff here
to furnish a happening pad.
Where did it all come from?
Don't tell, comrades!
All for one and one for all!
We stole it!
Oh, crumb.
What? What's going on?
I'll tell you what!
Our boys have taken up stealing.
One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
And all from watching
you on TV, you cool jerk!
Hey, lay off me!
TV would stink if everyone on
it was a positive role model.
Bender is about entertainment, baby!
You can't hold me responsible...
For what kids do when--
Hey. This is my stuff they stole!
That's the last straw! Bender
should not be allowed on television!
Bender must be stopped!
I've gone too far!
Who does that guy think I am?
Yeah!
That's right!
Come on! We're gonna march
all the way to Hollywood...
And make them stop forcing
their filthy me down our throats!
Yeah!
Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
This mob's with me.
Go ahead.
Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
Down with Bender! Down with--
Bender! Down with Bender!
As a doctor and captain
of this hospital ship...
I now pronounce you man and
wife with six months to live.
Listen up, Hollywood!
We're an exciting new mob!
Yeah!
You better believe it.
Great Shatner's ghost!
We demand that all TVs be
equipped with a B-Chip...
That blocks Bender from
appearing on the screen!
Boo-Ya!
Yeah.
I'm afraid the answer is
a gritty, in-Your-Face no.
Then I quit!
Then you don't quit.
I think you'll be finishing
the scene now, Mr. Bender.
And don't skimp on the nasty.
There'll be no further nasty!
We still have the option
of resorting to violence!
What makes you think that'll work?
I saw it on TV...
In that episode where Bender
shot Calculon. How cool was that?
Yeah! Come on!
Quit the show!
Do the scene.
I'm a cold-Blooded punk!
I once put a laugh track on a
sitcom that had no jokes in it.
Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!
Really?
Aha!
I was using that!
Listen up, because I've
got a climactic speech.
You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling!
You, director! Give me my motivation!
You're angry.
Perfect! Viewers of the world,
do smoking and drinking on TV...
Really make me cool?
Of course they do!
How about committing crimes and
violence? Again, the answer is yes.
But do we really want our kids
exposed to that kind of trash on TV?
I say absolutely not!
Oh!
On the other hand, most, perhaps all,
the blame rests with the parents.
That's right, you!
And so I ask you this one question:
Have you ever tried simply
turning off the TV...
Sitting down with your children...
And hitting them?
We're just so busy.
Well, make time.
And cut!
Good enough. Splice in some reaction
shots of me and shove it on the air.
Have you ever tried simply
turning off the TV...
Sitting down with your children...
And hitting them?
Well, I'd say we all learned a
valuable lesson about TV there.
What was it?
That we should all take
TV a little less seriously.
And more importantly,
turn it off once in a while.
Hear, hear!
Darn right!
So should we turn it off now?
Well That depends what's on.
One now...
Nothing good.
Let's just keep watching.
Futurama [5x16] - The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings - CiWaN
Huh?
I choose to not understand these signs.
Aha!
Bender! I was just not
playing the holophonor.
Yeah, well, you should
try not stinking at it.
Well, I am trying.
I've been taking lessons.
Lessons! Oh, that's rich!
Isn't it time you gave up all hope
of ever improving yourself in any way?
I know I should, but I just can't.
Remember those stomach worms
I had that made me smart?
I could play the holophonor.
And it made Leela like me.
Hey, Bender, as long as you know,
I have a holophonor recital Tuesday...
And I'd really like to
have somebody there. Please?
Fine. I'll go already.
You know, sometimes I wish your
real parents were still alive.
Not often, though.
Hey!
Hello, Mrs. Mellonger.
Hello, Philip.
And you must be Mr. Bender.
Philip's told me so much about you.
Is it true that you're a robot?
I prefer the term "Iove machine. "
Your kid is great.
How hard you say you had to hit him?
Fairly hard.
"The Grumpy Snail. "
Sorry.
It's too grumpy!
No! No! Quit! Stop!
Whoo!
Mr. Bender, I simply
cannot teach your child.
Then good day, madam!
We hope to see you soon for tea.
It's hopeless.
I can hear this great music in my head,
but my stupid hands can't keep up.
You know what always cheers me up?
Laughing at other people's misfortunes!
Hey, guys. You missed a
great delivery to space Earth.
Where you been all afternoon?
At a concert.
Was it jazz noodling?
My ex-Boyfriend Shawn played the sax.
I used to listen for hours while he
sat naked on my couch and improvised.
So musicians really
Rodger your Hammerstein?
Yeah. It's weird.
Shawn was uneducated, unambitious.
He was pasty and hunched.
Pretty boy.
But when he played, I could sense this
incredible, beautiful creative soul.
Then one day I found someone else's
couch fibers on his butt.
I couldn't even believe that.
That's really...
That could be my beautiful
soul sitting naked on her couch.
If I could just learn to
play this stupid thing.
Oh, but you can.
You may have to metaphorically
make a deal with the devil.
And by devil, I mean Robot Devil.
And by metaphorically,
I mean get your coat.
You hit a sour note about
200 years back, Doug!
Let's take it from the top.
Ow!
Bender! Fry!
You've come back for
more eternal damnation!
No, this isn't a religious visit.
Fry just wants holophonor lessons.
Yep. I need to get really
good without practicing.
Hell is full of 10-Year-Olds who
wanted exactly the same thing.
Trouble is, you have what
my old music teacher...
Mrs. Mellonger, calls "stupid fingers. "
With hands like that you'll be
lucky to master a belt buckle.
Now, wouldn't it be nice if you had
a pair of robot hands to replace them?
Sure would. Oh, well, goodbye.
Fry, you smelly idiot.
I think he's willing to make some
kind of deal with the devil with you.
He is? Great!
Wait, what's the catch?
No catch.
I'll merely pick a robot at random
from somewhere in the universe...
Probably one you've never even met,
and then I'll remove his hands...
And switch them for yours.
It's just the sort of guy I am.
What do you say?
I don't know.
It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
Fry, if you don't take this offer...
I will lose all respect
for you and punch you.
Well, all right.
You sure I won't know him?
Definitely probably not.
Just sign this contract.
Wow.
And here we go!
I got 100 bucks on Rectal Exam-Bot!
Ah!
Robot Devil? I get your hands?
Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome!
It's not ironic, it's just coincidental.
Now fork over those ladyfingers, cookie!
I only put my name on there as a show
of good faith for the other robots.
Stop being such a baby
and chop my hands off.
Oh, very well.
How'd you do that?
They're very good hands.
At last! At last I have the
power to make Leela love me!
Oh, sorry. That'll wear
off in a couple of days.
Check it out, everyone!
I'm back from hell
And I've got the Robot Devil's hands!
Neat!
Let's see a trick!
Alrighty.
Somebody called a Robot Devil's
here to see somebody called Fry.
Uh-Oh.
Where'd I go just now?
Hello, Fry.
Just dropped by to make sure you're
as happy with our little deal as I am.
And-- Oh, give me back my hands!
These things are always
touching me in places.
Yeah, they get around.
But I'm afraid we had a deal.
Looks like I wasted a bus trip.
Yes, you did.
Yes, now you can hear
holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry...
Playing 900 of these classic themes in
your own home on this two-Record set.
That's over 30 minutes
of music for only $14.99.
Only $14.99 for a two-Record set.
Two records!
Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're
becoming a crafty consumer.
Hello?
Hello? I'll take eight!
A Mr. Hedonism-Bot to see you.
Show him in.
Very good, sir.
Oh, Fry! Congratulations!
Your latest performance was as
delectable as dipping my bottom...
Over and over into a bath of
the silkiest oils and creams.
Thank you. That's exactly
what I was going for.
You are the sole diversion in what
has been a pale and unamusing season.
And so I would fain
commission you write an opera.
But I've never written an opera.
And I've never heard one.
Still, if you can keep me
amused through the overture...
I shall consider it a smashing success.
But I wouldn't even know
what to write about. Unless...
Okay, I'll do it.
If I can make it about Leela.
Me? Really?
A man writing an opera about a woman?
Oh, sirrah. How deliciously absurd.
I shall see you at the premiere.
Is it part of the opera?
Leela! You shouldn't be listening.
I don't want you to hear it till it's done.
But it's so beautiful.
So is a peacock, but you
don't eat it until it's cooked.
This has to be perfect.
I want you to hear exactly what
I hear when I think about you.
Oh, Fry. All this time you've had
this incredible gift and I never knew.
I've been a fool.
A fully justified, prudent fool.
Ah! They're so cold!
And yet hell is so hot!
Can I have my hands?
No!
You're not nice!
Bender, this is a surprise.
For you, finding me in the refrigerator!
True, but at least I don't have
the hiccups anymore. What up?
Oh, well, it so happens I'm in
the mood to make a deal with you.
Forget it, you can't tempt me.
Really? There's nothing you want?
I forgot you could tempt
me with things I want.
I suppose I've always wondered what
it would be like to be more annoying.
Oh. Nothing simpler.
And all I ask in return is your
hands to replace these bony hot dogs.
Grabby and Squeezy? Never!
I love these guys!
Is there anything else
you would part with?
No! Nothing! Ain't gonna happen.
Yes! With this built-In stadium air horn,
I can really annoy people!
And all it cost me was my crotch plate.
You certainly are a
shrewd businessman, Bender.
Now find someone and
give them a good blast.
Yeah! That'll teach the
first person I see a lesson.
My ridiculously circuitous
plan is one quarter complete.
Well, Fry's opera
premieres tomorrow night.
I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves
that'll fit over my enormous forearms.
Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?
What? Are you talking?
Oh, God, I'm deaf!
Oops!
I'm so, so sorry, Leela.
I just wanted to annoy you.
What? Oh, this is horrible!
I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
Oh, how delightfully ironic.
It's not ironic. It's just mean.
Take this:
Oh! Out of aerosol. Also ironic.
Oh, yeah? Well, bite my shiny metal--
Oh, no!
Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf.
If he found out I couldn't hear
his opera, it'd break his heart.
Okay, Deafo.
Courtesans and gentle fops,
I bid you welcome to my opera.
Let us cavort like the Greeks of old.
You know the ones I mean.
Hurrah!
Yay, Fry!
I watch TV with that guy!
Who is this one-Eyed...
Female baby Moses?
With courage in...
Her female baby smile?
A savior from the stars...
Or something stranger still?
Or just a lonely...
Filthy, starving child?
Amy, Fry's looking at me.
What am I supposed to be feeling?
Ah.
Leela, Leela, Leela, save him...
Save Fry, save Fry...
Godzilla will devour him...
As for me, I must be off...
To have my doctor check this cough...
Goodbye...
I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla.
But that is so what I would've done.
One diet double martini, please.
And for you, sir?
I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
Extra! Extra!
World's greatest opera only half over!
Half over? Oh!
I'd give anything to hear the rest.
Anything?
Thank you, sir.
Now, as I was saying, anything?
Because I can give you new robotic ears.
What?
You can give me new ears?
Wait. What seemingly reasonable
thing do you want in return?
Just your hands, my dear.
Whatever you said, forget it.
All right, then. Just one hand.
Just my left hand?
Please take your seats for Act 2.
I'm not done vomiting!
I can't stand it!
Okay! You can have my hand.
Wonderful! Just sign here.
Calculon, old friend,
I'm afraid I need your ears.
Well, I do owe you for giving
me this unholy acting talent!
I can hear!
I can hear like a safecracker!
Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?
In good time. You go enjoy the opera.
To win Leela 's heart...
With the holophonor's art...
I need hands...
Of transcendental quickness...
Well, I don 't see any danger...
ln gambling with a stranger...
For my head is...
Of a most amazing thickness...
I'm stupid, I'm stupid...
I'm stupider than you...
I'm stupider than you...
ln every way...
Stupider?
This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!
Your lyrics lack subtlety.
You can't just have your
characters announce how they feel.
That makes me feel angry!
Look, what do you want?
I want my hands back...
Never!
A deal's a deal...
Even with a dirty dealer...
Very well, then I'll take...
What I want from Leela...
Whoa!
Leela has promised me her hand...
Fry, you do not understand...
I should have revealed...
I'd been deafened by Bender...
The shame, the shame...
But I feared you'd stop writing...
This musical splendor...
Deception 's the curse...
Of my whimsical gender...
He gave me mechanical ears...
Effective, though just a bit garish...
In return, without shedding a tear...
I agreed that I'd give him my hand...
In marriage...
Huh?
What?
You'll give me your hand in marriage...
Is this really happening...
Or just being staged?
It can 't be real...
Not if Leela is engaged...
That isn 't what I meant...
That isn 't what I signed...
You should have checked...
The wording in the fine...
Print...
"I'll give you my hand."
In marriage...
"The use of words expressing something
Other than their literal intention"...
Now that is irony...
I will marry her now...
And confine her to hell...
How droll, how droll...
Where Styx is a river...
And notjust a band...
Though they'll play our reception...
lf all goes as planned...
Unless, Fry, you surrender...
My hands...
Destiny has cheated me...
By forcing me to decide upon...
The woman that I idolize...
Or the hands of an automaton...
Without these hands I can 't complete...
The opera that was captivating her...
But if I keep them...
And she marries him...
Then he probably won't...
Want me dating her...
Bravo! Encore!
I can 't believe the devil...
Is so unforgiving...
I can 't believe...
Everybody's just ad-Libbing...
By the power vested in me...
By the state of New New York...
No! Stop! Take my hands!
You evil, metal dork...
Surgery in an opera?
How wonderfully decadent!
And just as I was
beginning to lose interest.
Jombee, the chocolate icing.
Oh. Oh, my, yes.
My hands!
My horrible human hands!
And what did you do to my nails?
I cleaned them.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my poker night and I feel lucky.
So it's back to hell for me.
Come on, Nixon!
Less reality, more fantasy!
Resume the opera!
But I can't play anymore!
Yes, you can! The beauty was
in your heart, not your hands!
The music's bad and you should feel bad!
Ah! Oh! Whoa! Hey! Whoa.
Extra! Extra!
Greatest opera of all time sucks!
I'll take eight.
Please don't stop playing, Fry.
I wanna hear how it ends.

Vas-y, allez, tue-moi,
qu'est-ce que t'attends?
- Je m'appelle Bender.
- Au secours, que se passe-t-il?
Vous ętes décédé.
Merci d'utiliser Vitamor.
La cabine suicide préférée
du pays depuis 2008.
Ce truc est bon pour la ferraille.
J'avais rien d'autre de prévu.
Viens, on va se cuiter.
...deux, trois...
- Bienvenue dans le monde de demain!
- La ferme, Terry.
C'est inacceptable, Leela.
Il faut retrouver Fry
et lui mettre l'implant.
C'est un jeune paumé
qui n'a pas envie d'ętre livreur.
Je préfčre ne pas le forcer.
C'est votre job,
que vous l'aimiez ou non.
Mon job est de vous faire faire
le vôtre que je l'aime ou non.
Mais moi j'adore, j'aime mon travail.
Allez, au boulot.
Que la vie est douce.
BONNE ANNEE
PUB O'ZORGNAX
FORTRAN
VIEILLI
- Pourquoi ce besoin de boire?
- Je n'ai pas besoin de boire.
La preuve, j'arręte quand je veux.
Ils ont fait de toi un livreur?
C'est aussi nul que mon travail.
- Tu fais quoi, Bender?
- Je suis tordeur.
Je suis programmé
pour tordre du métal.
- Et tu es un bon tordeur?
- Tu plaisantes, j'étais le meilleur!
Je te tordais une barre ŕ l'angle
que tu voulais. 30 ou 32 degrés.
Il n'y avait qu'ŕ demander.
31 degrés.
Je n'ai pas supporté d'apprendre
ce qu'on faisait des barres.
- Quoi?
- Des cabines ŕ suicide.
Fry, trčs content
de t'avoir rencontré.
- Je vais aller me suicider.
- Attends, tu es mon seul ami ici!
- Tu veux vraiment un robot pour ami?
- Oui, depuis l'âge de six ans.
Bon, mais je ne voudrais pas
qu'on pense qu'on est robosexuels.
Si jamais on te le demande,
tu es mon debugger.
Oh, non. La cyclope!
- Planque-toi, elle va nous voir!
- T'inquičte pas.
- Ici 1BDI, je demande des renforts.
- Nous serons lŕ dans cinq minutes.
On peut se cacher lŕ,
le musée est gratuit le mardi!
Bienvenue au musée des tętes.
Je suis Leonard Nimoy.
Spock!
Vas-y, fais le signe.
- Je ne le fais plus maintenant.
- C'est incroyable!
Comment vous occupez-vous?
Nous apportons notre sagesse
ŕ qui le demande.
C'est une vie trčs digne.
C'est l'heure de manger!
Je regrette,
mais je dois vous mettre l'implant.
Pourquoi, si ça vous ennuie?
C'est mon travail.
On doit faire ce qu'on a ŕ faire.
PRESIDENTS
NE PAS HEURTER
Attention!
Toi, espčce de crétin,
tu vas me payer ça trčs cher!
Couché, vilain président.
Allez mon gars, éloigne-toi
de cette tęte.
Ca sent la bavure,
comme au XXIllčme sičcle.
Je vous en prie,
il est inutile d'employer la force.
On connaît notre métier.
Assez, ce n'est qu'un gamin
qui vient des âges stupides.
- N'y mets pas ton gros nez, cyclope.
- Personne ne se moque de mon nez.
SALLE DES CRIMINELS
- La vache.
- Vous ętes fous de cogner comme ça.
C'est notre job.
On est policiers.
C'est la loi:
"On doit faire ce qu'on a ŕ faire."
On est coincés!
Mais tu es un tordeur toi, on pourrait
sortir si tu tordais ces barreaux.
Tu ręves, je suis programmé pour
tordre du métal de construction.
- Tu me prends pour un démolisseur?
- On se fout de ton programme.
S'il te disait de sauter
d'un pont, tu le ferais?
Il faut que je vérifie mon programme.
Oui!
- Ouvrez cette porte!
- Allez, Bender.
Il faut prendre ses décisions.
Ca distingue les humains et les robots
des bętes...
- et des animaux-robots.
- Compte pas sur moi, Fry!
Tu as des arguments trčs persuasifs.
Vas-y Bender, tu peux y arriver!
Oh, non ces barreaux sont trop...
solides.
Ouais!
Tu avais raison, Fry. Désormais,
je tordrais ce que je veux...
quand je veux, oů je veux.
Et rien ne pourra m'en empęcher!
Je n'ai pas compris
comment tu as fait.
- Attendez!
- Non merci, pas la peine!
On dirait que l'un de nous va devoir
tordre cette grille.
Mon Dieu, qu'est-ce que c'est?
Ces ruines sont ce qui reste
de l'ancienne ville de New York.
Bienvenue chez toi.
J'habitais dans ce quartier. La vache,
ça me rappelle des tas de souvenirs.
Tu les gardes pour toi.
J'avais amené ma petite amie ici
pour notre tout 1er rendez-vous.
Elle n'est plus lŕ. Tous ceux que
j'ai connus et aimés ne sont plus lŕ.
Y a quelqu'un que tu connais.
Lâchez-moi, je suis déjŕ
assez malheureux comme ca.
Ecoutez, je sais que ça ne vous
consolera pas mais je vous comprends.
- Je n'ai plus ni maison, ni famille.
- Ni amis.
Mon monde a disparu.
Vous ne pouvez pas savoir
ce que c'est de se retrouver si seul.
Je le sais. Je suis la seule
extraterrestre ŕ un śil sur terre.
Mes parents m'ont abandonnée.
J'ignore de quelle galaxie je viens.
Croyez-moi, je sais ce que c'est
qu'ętre seule.
Ecoutez, je n'y comprends rien ŕ
ce monde mais vous si, apparemment.
Alors, j'abandonne.
Si vous croyez que mon destin
c'est d'ętre livreur, finissons-en.
Votre implant!
- Que faites-vous?
- Je démissionne.
- Pourquoi?
- Parce que j'en ai toujours eu envie.
Je ne le savais pas
jusqu'ŕ notre rencontre.
Pourquoi tu t'incrustes?
- Je voulais prendre part ŕ ce moment.
- Il a volé ma bague!
Ah bon?
Voilŕ qui résout le mystčre
de la bague disparue.
Ca s'arrose un truc pareil.
Je ne veux pas gâcher la fęte
mais on est des déserteurs.
- On n'a plus ni travail ni abri.
- Correction: Pas de travail...
mais on a un petit neveu
pour nous recevoir.
Je suis la tęte de Dick Clark.
Bienvenue pour l'édition spéciale
an 3000 de: "Réveillon et rock"!
- Qui ętes-vous?
- Je suis votre grand-oncle Fry.
- Je n'ai pas de grand-oncle Fry!
- Maintenant, si.
Bon sang, mais c'est vrai,
je suis ton neveu, c'est incroyable!
- Vous avez de l'argent pour nous?
- De l'argent? Non.
Et ici, c'est mon atelier.
Voici ma table de travail
et mon tabouret.
Ca, c'est mon vaisseau
intergalactique.
Et dans ce tiroir, je conserve
des câblages de toutes les longueurs.
- La vache, un vaisseau spatial!
- Que j'ai conçu et réalisé.
Je vais vous montrer les longueurs
de câblage que j'ai utilisées.
Déserteurs d'emploi,
sortez les mains en l'air!
- Vous ętes partiellement encerclés!
- Non!
Enfoncez-moi cette porte.
- On est cuits.
- Peut-on fuir avec le vaisseau?
Oui, je suppose
que c'est techniquement possible.
Mais je suis encore en pyjama.
Je vais nous sortir de lŕ.
- Quelqu'un sait-il piloter?
- Moi.
Tant qu'on ne me demande pas
de faire un créneau.
S'ils décollent,
explose-les ŕ coups de laser.
Parés pour le décollage!
- Dix.
- Neuf.
Sept!
Cinq!
Quatre.
- Trois.
- Deux.
- Un!
- Pleins gaz!
Tirez! Tirez!
Je ne les vois pas, mais ça fait joli.
On a déserté nos emplois,
on est des fugitifs ŕ vie.
Pas nécessairement.
Est-ce que ça vous intéresserait
de devenir mon nouvel équipage?
Nouvel équipage,
qu'est devenu l'ancien?
Ces maudits fils de...
C'est sans importance.
L'important est
que j'ai besoin de vous.
- Alors, ça vous intéresse?
- Oui, oui!
C'est le job de mes ręves!
Merci, mais aucun d'entre nous
ne porte l'implant nécessaire.
Ce n'est pas un problčme.
J'ai récupéré ceux de mon ancien
équipage. J'ai bien fait, non?
TROUVES DANS L'ESTOMAC
D'UNE GUEPE SPATIALE
Super, c'est génial!
On va battre des monstres et montrer
l'amour ŕ des extraterrestres?
Si par cela tu entends
le transport de cargaison, alors oui.
C'est une entreprise
pour financer mes recherches.
Cool, je ferai quoi comme travail?
Responsable de l'acheminement
des cargaisons ŕ destination.
- Je serai une sorte de livreur?
- Exactement!
C'est super, on m'engage
comme livreur!

- Ouah!
- Pas sur la même chaîne.
Livraisons interplanétaires,

Evans, où est ce colis
venant de Saturne?
Je ne suis pas Evans!
Il aurait dû choisir
Planet Express!
Si les autres compagnies
ne sont pas assez téméraires...
choisissez Planet Express,
un service sûr et ponctuel.
Votre colis,

Bon travail, Evans. Tu as un grand
avenir dans cette boîte.
Merci, monsieur.
Planet Express. Notre personnel est

- Non, c'est un effet spécial.
Je vais faire le petit-déjeuner,

On a déposé ce colis.

C'est toujours si dur de choisir.
Vous!
Vous devez signer

"Mort par manque d'oxygène."
"Mort par parasite cérébral."
- "Par diarrhée sonique."
- C'est une horreur.
Je ne connais pas ceux d'avant...
mais j'ai l'intention
de limiter les pertes.
Signez, je vous prie.
Fry, avant d'aller dans l'espace,
tu dois passer une visite médicale.
Tu verras,
le docteur est assez particulier.
Il porte des tongs.
Dr Zoidberg, voici Fry, le nouveau
livreur. Il vient pour la visite.
Excellent. Excellent.
Tout va bien se passer.
Ouvrez la bouche
que j'ausculte l'encéphale.
Non, pas cette bouche-là.
Mais je n'en ai qu'une.
Vraiment?
- Il n'y a pas un docteur humain?
- Mademoiselle, je suis un expert.
Ouvrez une bouche,
n'importe laquelle et dites
Quoi? Ma mère était une sainte.
Sortez d'ici!
Ce que vous êtes sale, Bender!
Je suis légèrement poussiéreux.
Amy, tu veux bien nettoyer son corps.
Prends ca.
D'accord, ça te fait mal
quand je fais ça?
Hé oh!
Un peu.
Je suis en pleine forme,
quand vais-je dans l'espace?
Dès que nous aurons fini
de nettoyer Bender.
Voici notre interne, Amy Wong.
C'est un de nos futurs ingénieurs.
Je suis ravi car elle a le même
groupe sanguin que moi.
C'est toi le mec décongelé
qui vient du 20ème siècle?
Aux dernières nouvelles, oui.
Une seconde. Amy Wong?
Les Wong de Mars?
On n'est pas aussi riches
qu'on croit.
- De quel fac viens-tu?
- Kappa Kappa Wong.
La milliardaire, regarde par ici!
C'est moi, Bender.
Je me sens comme neuf.
Regarde ma tête!
On dirait qu'elle sort de l'usine!
Ma bonne vieille tête!
C'est fini. Je suis crevé.
Retrouver la jeunesse,
être solide comme un robot.
Jeunes gens,
vous avez un colis à livrer.
Enfin! Allez, Bender.
On va bosser.
Tu m'as raté, abruti.
A: LUNA PARK
- Où on va?
- Un vol de routine sur la Lune.
La Lune? La Lune?
Je vais devenir un héros
aussi célèbre que Neil Armstrong
et tous les autres inconnus!
J'adore les endroits comme ca.
Je peux venir?
Bon, si tu veux mais sois prudente,
j'aimerais éviter les catastrophes...
au moins jusqu'à mon 2ème jour.
Il n'y a aucun risque. Si ça tourne
mal, rapportez-moi son sang.
- Je peux faire le compte à rebours?
- Si ça te fait plaisir.
- 10, 9
- Ca y est, on est arrivés.
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, décollage.
- Vite, je veux voir la Lune!
- C'est ouvert jusqu'à 21 h.
Un petit pas pour Fry.
Et une queue géante pour les billets.
Je peux passer devant?
Non.
Vous ne me croirez pas, il y a un
parc d'attractions sur la Lune!
C'est l'endroit le plus marrant
sur l'orbite de la Terre.
- Alors on y va.
- Nous avons un colis à livrer.
On le balance
et on dit qu'on l'a livré.
Trop de boulot. Brûlons-le,
on dira qu'on l'a jeté.
- Quand vous aurez fini vos âneries.
- Vas-y, on t'écoute.
On livre ce colis comme
des professionnels et on rentre.
Mais je n'ai jamais été sur la Lune.
Bon, on livre ce colis
comme des professionnels...
et on va aux autos
tamponneuses.
Aide à décharger le colis. Ferme bien
et fais attention aux clés.
Comme à la prunelle de mon œil.
Enfin, je les aurai à l'œil.
- C'est bon?
- C'est bon.
- Parés à débarquer?
- Parés.
Ouah!
Ma 1ère livraison dans l'espace.
Salutations, homme de la Lune.
Nous venons en paix.
Je suis Fry, de la planète Terre.
Si j'étais pas aussi feignant,
je te mettrais un pain.
- Alors continuez d'être feignant.
- Ne me cherche pas, toi.
Salut, je suis Jimmy Cratère,
bienvenue à Luna Park!
Je dois vous confisquer cet alcool.
De plus costauds que toi
y ont laissé leurs dents.
Au moins moi, je garde le respect
de moi-même.
JE SUIS AVEC CET IDIOT
SUR LA LUNE
Mais qui peut acheter ça?
Des abrutis les offrent
à d'autres abrutis.
Je vous ai acheté des magnets!
Enlève-moi ça, enlève-moi ça!
Eloigne ça, les aimants bousillent
mon processus d'inhibition.
Tu disjonctes et tu deviens

Quand on est un robot, il faut être
taré pour vouloir devenir chanteur.
Baleiniers de la mer de Tranquillité
Bender! Salut!
Je le crois pas,
j'étais au lycée avec ce type.
Monsanto présente
"La revue des marmottes marrantes".
Pourquoi sur la Lune
on a une voix très aigüe?
C'est à cause du manque de gravité.
C'est nul!
Adressez toute réclamation
à Monsanto Corporation.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
Je ne sais pas. Ce parc est bien,
mais on sent que tout est artificiel.
La gravité, l'air, les marmottes,
autant rester sur Terre.
C'est ça que je veux voir!
Je veux faire comme les astronautes,
le reste est nul.
C'est nul mais drôle.
Dehors, il n'y a rien à faire.
T'es le genre de mec
qui visite Jérusalem...
mais pas la Sexytéria.
On devrait faire la balade
en jeep lunaire.
On porte un scaphandre
et on se promène.
C'est éducatif,
donc on ne fait pas la queue.
Peu importe que ce soit éducatif,
on y va!
A l'année prochaine, à Jérusalem!
DESTINATION LA LUNE
Enfin, je sens
qu'on va s'éclater sur la Lune.
L 'histoire de l'exploration lunaire
commença par un rêve:
Le rêve d'un homme.
A un de ces jours, Alice!
Bang! Zoom! Direct sur la Lune!
J'ignorais que les 1er astronautes
étaient aussi bedonnants.
Mais c'est un acteur de télé!
C'était une métaphore
pour dire qu'il bat sa femme.
Skeeball virtuel
Skeeball Virtuel Virtuel
J'aurais pu jurer que je jouais
vraiment au Skeeball virtuel!
Regarde, c'est le colis
qu'on voulait balancer.
Les clés du vaisseau!
J'ai dû les faire tomber dedans.
- Leela va me tuer.
- Non, elle me demandera de le faire.
Vous pourriez attraper ces clés?
Quoi encore?
Je suis bien trop feignant.
On ne sait pas où et comment l'homme
se posa pour la 1ère fois sur la Lune.
- Moi, je sais.
- Mais nos historiens pensent...
que les choses se sont passées
comme ça
Ca ne s'est pas passé comme ça.
Tu n'es pas prof d'histoire!
Piquons la jeep
et allons voir la vraie Lune.
C'est ma 1ère mission
et je ne veux aucun problème.
- Et puis la jeep est sur un rail.
- Pas pour longtemps.
Bien, tu es à la surface,
je te donne 10 min.
Ensuite, tu t'ennuieras
et t'excuseras pour ta conduite.
- Ca marche?
- Ca marche.
On va mettre la radio!
Au prochain cratère,
tu fais demi-tour.
Tu veux aller voir le site
du 1er alunissage?
Ne dis pas de bêtises.
- Il est perdu depuis des siècles.
- C'est mon jour de chance.
On fait demi-tour si tu veux.
On va mourir!
C'est chacun pour soi!
Au secours, Leela!
T'as réussi, on est sauvés.
Non. Maintenant, on va mourir.
Alors c'est chacun pour soi!
- Ca vient de la poche d'un touriste.
- Tu me déconcentres!
C'est comme faire l'amour.
Tu sais, gauche, bas,
rotation 62 degrés, engagement rotor.
Je sais comment faire l'amour.
Laisse-moi faire.
Saleté de bras, il doit être truqué.
C'est elle! C'est elle qui m'a
programmé pour faire le mal!
Si c'est comme ça, je vais
ouvrir mon parc d'attractions...
avec des tables de blackjack
et des putes.
En fait, même pas besoin de parc.
Excuse-moi,
c'est trop dur, j'abandonne.
Laisse-moi crever dans cette ferme.
On est sauvés!
- Des pilleurs?
- Non, des visiteurs du parc.
C'est un endroit malsain.
Sauf la grande roue.
Le reste est malsain.
On n'a plus d'oxygène,
vous nous en donnez?
Et puis quoi encore? L'oxygène
ne pousse pas dans les arbres.
Vous devrez travailler
dans ma ferme hydroponique.
Vous retournerez au parc
au lever du soleil.
On n'a qu'à se défoncer
quelques heures.
Ici, les nuits durent 2 semaines.
Et on peut atteindre
les - 173 degrés.
Fahrenheit ou Celsius?
D'abord les uns, ensuite les autres.
Vos scaphandres ne sont pas chauffés,
donc vous n'irez nulle part.
Vous dormirez dans la grange.
Et ne vous avisez pas de toucher
à mes trois filles robots, compris?
Vos filles robots?
- Elle, c'est Lulabelle Sept.
- You-hou!
- Daisy Mae 128K.
- You-hou!
Et ma choupinette!
You-hou.
Je t'avais dit de retourner au parc.
Mais monsieur trouvait ça nul,
il voulait voir la vraie Lune.
On a vu des cratères
et des cailloux!
Des cailloux en forme de cratère
et ces bestioles!
La Lune, ça craint, ce n'est qu'un
terrain vague plein de poussière.
Les gens ne viennent ici
que pour visiter ce parc si nul.
- C'est comme ça, accepte-le.
- J'y arrive pas.
Je vais t'apprendre à coucher
avec mes filles robots!
- Il ne me trouvera jamais ici!
- Bender?
T'as pas couché
avec sa choupinette au moins?
Non, une femme de cette classe,
il faut la courtiser.
Vous n'irez pas loin!
Viens, choupinette!
Papa.
- On passera pas!
- Attendez! Sautez!
Accrochez-vous à vos casques!
- Oui!
- C'est pas vrai!
Qu'est-ce que t'attends, saute!
Non, papa. Je l'aime.
Cool!
La face cachée de la Lune.
La nuit tombe.
- Vite ou on va geler!
- Qui ça "on", mammifères?
Il faudrait que je leur vienne
en aide...
mais je suis déjà en pyjama.
On ne va pas tenir.
L'ombre se rapproche.
Regarde! Le site du 1er alunissage!
On l'a trouvé!
Vite, entre.
Regarde le drapeau américain et les
traces de pas de Neil Armstrong!
Mon pied est plus grand. N'as-tu
jamais vu de plus beau spectacle?
Ce n'est qu'un drapeau en plastique
et des empreintes de pas.
Grimpe sinon tu vas geler.
Pas de place pour Bender,
je m'en fous
je vais construire mon module avec
des tables de blackjack et des putes.
En fait, j'ai pas besoin de module
ni de blackjack.
Et puis ça me gonfle.
Avec l'oxygène, on tiendra assez
longtemps pour mourir de faim.
Je te demande pardon,
j'aurais dû t'écouter.
C'est vrai. La surface de la Lune
n'a aucun intérêt.
Je ne l'ai dit à personne...
mais quand j'étais à l'école,
je rêvais d'être astronaute.
Mais j'avais de mauvaises notes.
Et personne me supporte
plus d'une semaine.
T'es sûr qu'on peut tenir
une semaine?
Je trouvais la Lune grandiose et
mystérieuse, si haute dans le ciel...
que je ne pourrais jamais l'atteindre
alors que j'en rêvais.
Mais quand on y est, ce n'est
qu'un cailloux poussiéreux.
Ca t'aurait plu de la voir
comme je la voyais.
Fry, regarde.
La Terre est vraiment magnifique.
Je n'avais jamais remarqué avant.
Il a fallu que tu revoies
ma choupinette.
Je t'aurai cette fois.
C'est Amy, on est sauvés!
Où a-t-elle appris à se servir
des commandes?
Non, pas l'aimant!
Non! Non! Non!
Je vais te tuer Amy.
Crénom!
La vraie Lune ressemble-t-elle
à la Lune dont tu rêvais?
Ben... plutôt, ouais.

Tu viens de prendre
une dose ķnorme de radiations.
Mais j'ai une coiffure d'enfer.
Tu sais combien de temps
ńa prend de recalibrer?
Oui mais tu as vu le look,
ńa en vaut la peine, non?
Il faut qu'on parle de Fry.
Tout Ó fait, on veut de l'argent!
Qu'est-ce qu'il a Fry?
Il est gentil mais il faut
qu'il ait son appartement.
Il ne nous gĻne pas. Maintenant
excusez-moi, je suis occupķ.
J'avais une momie extraterrestre
et je ne la trouve plus.
Ce sarcophage devrait contenir
l'empereur Nimballa...
qui rķgna sur Zubin V,
il y a 30 millions d'annķes.
Hķ professeur,
super, vos saucisses sĶches!
Mon Dieu, comment a-t-il pu?
C'ķtait mon dķjeuner cette momie.
Fry doit se trouver un toit!
"Bachelor Chow", maintenant

Et Bigfoot est au tapis!
Ca craint, 4000 chaŅnes et que 2

"Robo Fresh", conńu par un robot,

- Mais je suis...
- Mķtrique?
Je l'ai toujours su. Mais pour toi,
je suis prĻt Ó me convertir.
Ca doit Ļtre le mķchant.
Fry, tu vas avoir

- On en a parlķ et...
- De tous mes Circuits!
Fais-moi de la place.
Parfois, si on est Ó l'ķtroit, on agit
de facon inconsidķrķe sans le savoir.
- Je sais, je te pardonne.
- Non...
je parle de ce bureau
quand je dis "Ó l'ķtroit".
- Quand je dis "on", c'est "toi".
- Bien.
- Et par "inconsidķrķ"...
- On regarde la tķlķ!
Ouais, pourrais-tu avoir l'obligeance
de la fermer?
- Ce mec bizarre, c'est qui?
- Un humain.
- Il fait quoi?
- Des trucs d'humain.
- Il rit, il ķtudie, il aime.
- Aucun intķrĻt.
Calculon, je vous croyais
dans le coma.
Exactement ce que je voulais.
Content de te voir, humain.
Pourquoi la tķlķ est
de plus en plus petite?
On vous facturera le canapķ.
Bouffe-o-Rama
Secoue-toi mon pote,
tu as Ó peine touchķ ton amibe.
Ca a l'air bon
mais j'ai pas faim, tu veux go¹ter?
Non, je me surveille. Je ne prends
que de l'alcool, c'est nourrissant.
L'ķnergie chimique recharge
mes batteries Ó bloc.
- Et le cigare, c'est pour quoi?
- Ca me donne un c¶tķ classe.
Je peux pas croire qu'on m'ait jetķ,
il faut que je sois une tache.
Oui, mais on est tous des taches.
Toi, moi, l'autre tache, lÓ.
C'est ńa ma philosophie.
Alors, o∙ tu vas habiter?
J'en sais rien, on trouve encore
des grands cartons?
Oui, avec des loyers exorbitants,

Sķrieusement? Ce serait super.
Tu es s¹r que ńa ne t'embĻte pas?
Non, de toute fańon

C'est tout petit.
Je ne vois pas o∙ ranger mes fringues.
T'as que celles que tu as sur toi...
et tu ne vas pas les enlever
quand je serai lÓ.
- Bon, moi je suis crevķ. Bonne nuit.
- Non attends, Bender. Bender?
Tuer tous les humains, tuer tous
les humains. Il faut tuer tous les...
Bender, rķveille-toi!
Je faisais un rĻve merveilleux.
Je crois que tu ķtais dedans.
Ecoute, Bender,
o∙ est la salle de bains?
- Quoi?
- La salle de bains.
- La salle?
- La salle de bains!
- Comprends pas?
- Laisse tomber.
Poupķe d'acier, ńa te dirait
de tuer tous les humains?
C'est la forme ce matin.
Cette semaine avec Fry a ķtķ gķniale.
Sous son apparence chaleureuse, bat
le c£ur mķcanique et froid d'un robot.
- Que t'est-il arrivķ?
- C'est l'appart de Bender.
Il a posķ de la moquette
et ma tĻte touche le plafond.
Pourquoi tu te tiens penchķe?
Redresse-toi.
- C'est mieux.
- Regarde-toi.
On dirait un clochard.
Il faut que tu dķmķnages.
C'est une invitation?
Quel humour! Tu dois dire Ó Bender
que tu ne peux plus rester.
Il va Ļtre triste. Je n'ai pas
le droit de lui faire ca.
Tiens, mais voilÓ mon squatter.
- Je vais habiter ailleurs.
- Quoi?
Dķsolķ, c'est trop petit chez toi.
Trop petit? Sur les 4 mĶtres cube,
chacun n'en occupe qu'un et demi.
Il reste assez de place
pour 2/3 d'un locataire.
Si je vous aidais
Ó trouver un endroit plus grand?
Je ne sais pas. J'ai de bons souvenirs
en mķmoire de mon ancien appart.
Ils sont effacķs.
Le meilleur de la vie
sous-marine!
Ce n'est pas une rķsidence
grand luxe, comme en surface...
mais c'est moins cher ici
et il y a trĶs peu d'humiditķ.
En tout cas il y a une trĶs jolie vue.
C'est quoi ńa?
Excusez-moi.
Je dois aller changer une ampoule.
Architecture
incroyable mais vraie
Celui-la est fantastique!
Je veux pas payer pour des dimensions
qu'on n'utilisera pas.
Logement ķtrangement
fantastique
C'est trop bien.
Il y a un lķzard?
Non, mais techniquement,
on est dans le New Jersey.
De tout ce qu'on a vu,
pas un appart habitable.
Mais c'est horrible,
j'espĶre qu'il n'a pas trop souffert.
Dķchiquetķ vous dites? Je vois.
Et sa femme s'en est sortie?
Dķchiquetķe aussi?
Je vous remercie.
Je viens d'apprendre la mort
de mon collĶgue, le Dr Mobootu.
Son appartement est dķjÓ Ó louer?
C'est superbe ici!
- Que faire de tout ca?
- Mais c'est joli!
Le Dr a rķuni ces objets en explorant
le... comment on dit... l'univers.
Cet appart a tout
sauf ce qui m'intķresse, la tķlķ.
Bien s¹r qu'il y a la tķlķ,
jeune... comment on dit... imbķcile.
On se calme. Je ne me sens pas
aussi bien que chez moi ici.
Moi, il me faut un nid douillet.
Je peux Ó peine bouger.
C'est parfait!
A Bender, mon plus grand fan!
VoilÓ, la dķco est gķniale!
Pour la 1Ķre fois depuis
qu'on m'a dķgelķ, je me sens chez moi.
Ouais, on va s'ķclater Ó mort ici.
Je vais te dire Fry, de tous les amis
que j'ai eus, tu es le premier.

Salut, mec.
Joyeuse pendaison de crķmaillĶre.
Voici un bonsa’ salade de fruits.
- Salut, Amy.
- Ouille.
C'est pour toi, Fry. Zevulon le Grand,
il est Ó point, tu vas te rķgaler.
La vache,
qu'est-ce qu'ils descendent!
Il faut que je rachĶte Ó boire.
Ca va Ļtre De tous mes circuits.
J'ai besoin d'alcool
pour me recharger.
Si Calculon avait un
problĶme Ó son mariage...
je serais ķmotionnellement
et ķlectriquement Ó plat.
C'est vraiment excellent.
Merci, c'est moi qui les ai faites.
Chut, le mariage va commencer.
Si quelqu'un veut s 'opposer Ó cette
union, qu'il parle ou se taise pour...
- Il s'oppose ou il veut l'aider?
- Les deux.
Mon demi-frĶre a raison,
je cache un terrible secret.
Et ce secret c'est...
- Oh, non!
- Faites quelque chose!
Qu'est-il arrivķ Ó la tķlķ?
- On n'a plus rien.
- Quel scandale!
Je vais aller gueuler
chez la gardienne!
Oh c'est rķparķ!
Reviens, la tķlķ remarche!
Je vous rķpĶte
que mon terrible secret c'est...
- On a de nouveau plus rien.
- Quoi? Ah cette fois j'en ai marre!
Hķ, ńa y est, c'est revenu!
Je viens pas pour voir
ce que vous faites...
avec la cyclope,
le crustacķ et la chinoise...
mais vos voisins se plaignent
de la rķception tķlķ.
Trouvez trĶs vite d'o∙ ca vient
ou on se barre de ce taudis.
Relaxe, mon gars, ce dķtecteur va
trouver la source de l'interfķrence.
- Qu'est-ce que ńa veut dire?
- Pourquoi on n'a plus de tķlķ?
Le problĶme vient de lÓ.
Oh mon Dieu, Bender,
c'est ton machin!
La solution c'est qu'il parte!
N'importe quoi, mon antenne n'a jamais
interfķrķ avec l'ancienne tķlķ!
C'ķtait le cŌble pas le satellite.
La tķlķ et tes pensķes
sont sur la mĻme frķquence.
- Et sur celle de mon tķlķphone.
- Madame, vous faites s¹rement erreur.
Elle est dr¶lement ķquipķe celle-lÓ!
Ca pourrait Ļtre n'importe qui,
la grosse!
- Le robot doit quitter l'immeuble!
- Oh oui!
- Bon, vous avez entendu?
- Parfait!
Viens, on va louer l'appart
avec une odeur d'ķgout.
Il te plaisait celui-lÓ.
C'est tentant mais je suis dķjÓ
pratiquement installķ.
On pourrait aller vivre en sous-sol
avec les mutants. On leur montrerait.
On pourrait pas trouver une solution
du genre: Tu t'en vas et je reste?
Que veux-tu dire?
Il te faut un bon placard, alors
retourne dans ton ancien appart.
Mais on n'habitera plus ensemble.
Je passerai te voir.
Tu pourras venir aussi.
- Non, interdit!
- Ce sera mieux comme ca.
On sera bien plus heureux.
Heureux. Mais oui, bien s¹r,
Bender, il est toujours heureux.
Hķ, regardez,
il y a la tķlķ qui remarche!
...la mort de Calculon...
industriel, dķtective privķ et ami.
Puis-je faire moi-mĻme
mon ķloge funĶbre?
Calculon, tu es vivant!
Calculon est revenu!
Bon allez, au revoir.
Bonsoir.
Le frĶre de Calculon pourra-t-il
remarcher?
Je ne sais pas, Amy.
Je le souhaite en tout cas.
Merci d'Ļtre venus.
Tu laisses une manif
de voisins virer ton ami Bender?
Je t'en prie.
Bender adore les manifs.
Quand il en fait partie.
Tu mķprises ses sentiments.
C'est des trucs de nanas.
On est des mecs.
On n'a pas de sentiments.
- Ce n'est pas un mec mais un robot.
- C'est pareil.
C'est tellement grand et vide.
Mon copain est parti.
Tout ce qu'il laisse, c'est un cil
et trois bouts de peau morte.
A quoi bon?
Bender, tu es dans un ķtat!
- Fous-moi la paix.
- Ta rouille a au moins 2 jours!
Tu as passķ la nuit Ó ne pas boire.
Ce que je ne fais pas
ne te regarde pas.
Bois un petit verre. Fais-le pour ceux
qui t'aiment au moins.
Je hais les gens qui m'aiment
et eux-aussi, ils me ha’ssent.
Il est ķvident
que la compagnie de Fry te manque.
Te laisser aller ne va rien arranger.
Tu me conseilles quoi?
De couper mon antenne?
C'est une solution.
Tu es malade,
elle a beaucoup d'importance!
La couper... Tu n'es ni un robot
ni un homme, tu peux pas comprendre.
Bon allez, moi je me casse.
Regarde-moi dans l'£il
et promets-moi de ne pas conduire...
sans avoir bu assez
pour ne pas avoir d'accident.
Je promets que dalle!

Oh, salut Leela.
Je dois te parler,
tu as ķtķ dur avec Bender.
Je n'y suis pour rien
s'il fait des interfķrences.
Il n'y a pas que la tķlķ dans la vie.
Ton ami est en train de se dķtruire.
Je ne savais pas
que l'appart lui manquerait autant.
Il s'en moque. C'est toi qui lui
manque et tu lui as tournķ le dos.
Bon sang, je pensais pas. Si je savais
o∙ le trouver, j'irai lui parler.
Oh, elle me gonfle cette tķlķ!
Bender, tu es complĶtement sobre!
Je suis sobre, je suis dingue
et je sais plus ce que je dois faire.
- Ne le fais pas!
- Je te dis que je ne sais plus.
Ah si, je me souviens.
J'ai cru pouvoir vivre seul
mais je ne peux pas.
Je vais faire ce qu'il faut
pour qu'on puisse habiter ensemble.
- ArrĻte!
- Dķcapiter Leela n'arrangera rien!
Non, je vais couper mon antenne.
C'est une bonne idķe,
tu veux un coup de main?
Tu ne vas pas l'aider Ó se mutiler!
Elle ne sert Ó rien. Ca n'a aucune
importance si on l'enlĶve.
Je vais le faire. Je vous jure.
N'essayez pas de m'en empĻcher.
Attention!
Ca a marchķ,
il n'y a plus d'interfķrence!
- Je regrette ce malentendu.
- Moi aussi.
Cet instant m'emplit
d'une charge ķmotionnelle.
Vous Ļtes mon meilleur ami.
Pardon d'avoir ķtķ si moche.
Excuses acceptķes.
AprĶs tout, tu n 'es qu'un humain.
Vous pourriez tirer une leńon de ńa.
- Elle a raison.
- Tu es mon meilleur ami, Fry.
- Pardon d'avoir ķtķ si moche.
- Excuses acceptķes.
AprĶs tout, tu n'es qu'un humain.
Non, attendez.
Vous avez tout fait Ó l'envers.
C'est Fry qui aurait d¹ faire...
Oh, laissez tomber.
- Qu'est-ce que tu as?
- Rien.
C'est l'idķe de n'Ļtre plus
que la moitiķ d'un robot.
Oui c'est nul. Si on retrouvait
ton antenne, on pourrait la remettre?
Peut-Ļtre, si on la met
dans la glace immķdiatement.
Bingo!
Et il appelle ńa une antenne?
Cette fois, tu vas avoir
tout le confort humain.
On aura des toilettes,
de la vaisselle, peut-Ļtre un chien.
- C'est bon de rentrer chez soi
- Tu l'as dit.
Tiens, des affaires Ó toi.
C'est ici
que j'avais laissķ ces peaux mortes.
- Le bonsa’ aura assez de lumiĶre?
- Il y a une fenĻtre dans le placard.

Bender, je vais m'installer ici.

Je ne connaissais pas. La cuisine
est excellente et c'est très copieux.
Goûte ton dessert,
tu vas te régaler.
Tu sais, mon œil rebute
les hommes en général.
C'est bien d'en rencontrer un
qui a l'esprit ouvert.
Diffusé en contrôle cérébral
sur certains écrans
Victime de l'amour,
perdue dans l'espace
Qu'est-ce qui t'a déplu?
Je n'en sais rien.
Un petit truc m'a déplu.
Peut-être sa vilaine
langue de lézard.
Tu es trop difficile.
Si tu exclus tous ceux avec cette
langue et un Q.l. De casserole...
ou au tempérament violent,
tu resteras seule.
Il n'y a pas de honte
à être exigeante.
Son problème
est purement médical.
Bientôt elle va pondre ses œufs
et tout rentrera dans l'ordre.
Donne une chance aux mecs.
Tu crois que c'est un porc, puis
tu réalises qu'il a un corps superbe.
Merci pour vos précieux conseils.
Mais ma vie me satisfait pleinement.
C'est un appel au secours ça?
Si on sortait là
où on peut rencontrer des gens?
- A l'office des affaires sexuelles.
- Une boîte de strip robot.
La carcasse pourrissante
d'une baleine.
Je vais choisir.
LE CLUB BRANCHE
Oaou!
C'est complètement rétro!
- Pourquoi ils ont tous des anneaux?
- Car plus personne n'en porte.
- C'est devenu ringard.
- Je trouve ca cool.
Que personne t'entende dire ça!
Il a dit
que les anneaux étaient cool?
- Il a dit que c'était ringard.
- Cool!
Tu penses quoi du grand
près du bar?
- J'en sais rien. Peut-être.
- Il est gay.
Quoi? Comment tu le sais?
Je suis équipé d'un radar à gay.
Ca n'existe pas.
Non?
Bon, voilà,
je suis pile sur lui.
Ouais, il est gay.
- T'en es sûr?
- Absolument!
Ou c'est un ballon météo gay
qui interfère.
T'es du 20ème siècle? C'est dingue,
moi je suis du 21ème siècle.
On doit avoir
plein de points communs!
Tu te souviens quand les cyborgs
ont pris le pouvoir sur Terre?
Ouais, ça me dit quelque chose.
Voici Bolt Rolands.
Il fait de l'hyper surf, il a gagné
10 fois sur le circuit professionnel.
Salut, ma jolie.
Ce ne serait pas plutôt
sur le circuit gay?
J'aimerais bien.
Eux, ils savent s'envoyer en l'air.
Voici M-5438,
une entité de pure énergie.
Super. Mais ce n'est pas
vraiment ce que je recherche.
Mais un jour vous serez débarrassée
de toute contrainte physique.
Et ce jour-là, j'espère
que vous me passerez un coup de fil.
Tu es impossible.
Tiens, lui aussi.
A mon avis, il vient d'un pays...
où on adore les comédies musicales.
DIX VERRES MINIMUM
J'ai besoin de l'appart ce soir,
va donc voir un strip robot.
Et comment!
Mais qu'est-ce qu'une jolie femme
comme vous...
Bon sang! Pardon,
je croyais que vous aviez deux yeux.
Hier, il devait plus te rester que
le dessous du panier à la fermeture?
Arrêtez de vous mêler
de ma vie privée!
Nous nous mêlerons tous de sa vie
privée tout à l'heure.
Pour l'instant,
nous avons une mission.
- Une livraison?
- Un vol caritatif non imposable.
Voici Vergon 6.
Voici Vergon 6.
C'est une planète condamnée, peuplée
d'animaux condamnés eux aussi.
- Des animaux?
- Tout à fait.
Des animaux qui mourront
si on ne fait rien.
Avant Vergon 6 recelait une matière
très dense appelée "Matière obscure".
MATIERE OBSCURE
Chaque kilo pesait plusieurs
dizaines de tonnes.
Et que va-t-on faire
pour les animaux?
Cette matière obscure est
un super carburant pour fusée.
C'est pourquoi elle fut extraite,
laissant la planète creuse.
Et pour les animaux?
- Les quoi?
- Les animaux.
Je n'ai jamais parlé d'animaux,
Vergon 6 s'effondrera dans 3 jours.
Ce sera la mort
de tous les animaux.
Nous devons en ramener deux
de chaque espèce, comme Noé.
Pourquoi deux?
Je parie que Leela va se trouver
un mec sympa avec un œil.
Ca risque de prendre du temps.
Elle devrait en trouver un
avec deux yeux et lui en enlever un.
Ca gagnerait du temps.
Je ne vous dérange pas?
Tiens, c'est pour enlever un œil.
Peu m'importe le nombre d'yeux
d'un mec tant qu'il en a moins de 5.
Je veux qu'il ait le goût du risque,
qu'il soit sûr de lui et élégant.
Ces nouveaux uniformes
sont d'une rare élégance.
Je suppose, Capitaine.
Le velours, c'est pas mon truc.
Que comptez-vous faire
de ce vaisseau non-identifié?
Le détruire!
C'est très agréable à porter.
Journal du Capitaine.
Date stellaire: 3000.3.
A qui parlez-vous?
A vous. Allez, au travail.
Un vaisseau veut franchir le cordon
de sécurité entourant Vergon 6.
Je prévois un tir de missile
protonique suivi d'un dîner léger.
Ravioli aux truffes, sorbet fraise...
C'est le vaisseau
de Zapp Brannigan.
- Le Zapp Brannigan!
- Uh-huh.
C'est quoi le Zapp Brannigan?
Devons-nous ouvrir le feu?
Pas encore, Kif.
Aux échecs, il ne faut pas montrer
d'emblée ses cartes à son adversaire.
Quoi?
On dit qu'il a sauvé seul
le système Octillion...
de robots tueurs devenus dingues.
- Oaou!
- Triste souvenir pour nous.
Mais on peut en construire d'autres!
C'est le capitaine le plus décoré
de l'Ordre des Planètes.
Leela est amoureuse!
Non, mais on devrait voir s'il peut
nous aider à sauver ces animaux.
Si jamais ce mec te tape dans l'œil,
tu devrais emporter ça.
Ils viennent droit sur nous.
Approche bien calculée sans doute
inspirée par le texte de Sun Tzu.
Ou par mon chef d'œuvre: Le grand
livre de guerre de Zapp Brannigan.
Ce que leur capitaine
ne sait pas encore...
Ils nous ont accostés
et sont à bord.
C'est une cruelle défaite,
je vais au module de sauvetage.
Si mon fauteuil survit au massacre,
renvoyez-le à ma boîte postale.
Je suis Leela, Capitaine du vaisseau
de Planet Express.
Nous avons besoin d'aide.
Quoi que ce soit...
C'est moi le Capitaine.
Zapp Brannigan.
Ma réputation m'a-t-elle précédée
ou vais-je trop vite?
Vous êtes une légende.
Et je suis vraiment ravie
de vous rencontrer.
Vous êtes impressionnante,
à la fois belle et audacieuse.
- Puissante combinaison.
- Vous me flattez.
Je ne connais que 2 ou 3 capitaines
qui soient aussi sexy que vous.
Et un seul qui soit plus hardi.
Vous avez vraiment battu une horde...
de je sais plus quoi
dans le système machin-truc.
Les robots tueurs?
Il m'a suffi d'être plus malin qu'eux.
Je n'aurais jamais pensé à ça.
Ils ont un quota
de victoires précis.
Sachant cela, j'ai envoyé
mes hommes un par un...
jusqu'à ce qu'ils tombent en panne.
Kif, montrez-leur
ma médaille du courage.
Encore un peu, s'il vous plaît.
Plus. Continuez.
Il faut que je vous parle
de notre mission.
Je suis prêt à mettre un par un...
tous mes hommes à votre disposition,
n'est-ce pas?
Tu crains!
Nous espérons sauver
les animaux de Vergon 6.
- Et si vous pouviez...
- Vergon 6!
- Cette collation est terminée.
- Pourquoi?
L'Ordre des Planètes interdit d'agir
sur les mondes sous-développés.
C'est la "Loi de Brannigan".
Des gens ont exploité cette planète,
maintenant elle est creuse.
L'Ordre des Planètes
y avait des mineurs.
Ca n'a vraiment aucun sens.
Je ne prétends pas comprendre
cette loi, mais je la respecte.
Bien, nous sauverons
les animaux sans vous.
Hélas, je dois m'y opposer. Gardes!
- Que se passe-t-il?
- Il nous balance en taule.
Ca craint!
Vous auriez un doggy bag?
J'aurais pu aimer Zapp,
s'il ne m'avait pas jetée en prison.
Tu es vraiment trop difficile.
Venez avec moi
sur le pont supérieur.
J'aimerais que l'on médite un peu.
Oh, mon Dieu!
Je suis face à un grand adversaire
féminin. Des suggestions?
Je ne vois plus
aucun problème, monsieur...
puisqu'elle est en prison
en vertu de l'article B-10.81.
De la loi de Brannigan!
Oui, de cette loi.
- Laquelle?
- La loi de Brannigan.
Vous êtes mon meilleur ami,
mais vous me décevez encore.
Vous devriez savoir
que le seul moyen...
de vaincre un adversaire féminin,
c'est de le séduire.
- C'est bien une femme cette fois?
- Oui!
Invitez-la dans mes appartements...
et que le boy prépare
ma veste d'intérieur.
Le boy, monsieur?
Vous sortirez ma veste d'intérieur.
Saint Suffisance veut vous voir
dans ses appartements.
Ce sera l'occasion de discuter
de capitaine à capitaine.
Et il voudrait que vous portiez ça.
Entre, je suis à toi!
Bienvenue dans mon humble chambre
qu'on appelle le "Palais du Plaisir".
- "Champague"?
- Je ne vous savais pas si raffiné.
J'aime tout ce qui est raffiné,
sauf le pétrole.
Pourrait-on parler sérieusement?
Autorisez-nous à secourir
ces animaux.
J'adore ton style.
Je le trouve très érotique.
- Quoi?
- Erotique!
J'ai une idée. Pour s'évader, arrache
la trappe du conduit de vapeur.
C'est une bonne idée ca?
C'est plein de vapeur!
Tu as l'air d'apprécier
les choses délicates.
Viens sentir la finesse du velours
de mon couvre-lit.
Je n'en ai aucune envie.
Leela, c'est du vrai velours.
Laisse-toi aller.
Je veux retourner en prison.
Tu préfères la prison
à une nuit avec Zap?
Oui, et de loin.
Qu'est-ce que vous avez?
Je suis pitoyable.
Tu peux t'en aller,
je suis désolé.
Tu veux le reste du "champague"?
Non et ça se prononce "champagne".
Oh, mon Dieu, non!
Ce n'est pas très grave.
Je suis si seul. Je croyais que toi,
un capitaine, tu comprendrais.
Oui, je connais ça.
C'est super de donner
des ordres aux gens.
Mais le résultat,
c'est qu'on se retrouve seul.
C'est le travail qui veut ça.
Je me sens tellement seul!
Je vous comprends, je sais que
c'est dur, mais il y a des bons côtés.
- On réessaie de s'évader?
- Je suis bien là.
Ca fait longtemps
que Leela est partie.
J'espère
qu'elle aura convaincu Zapp.
Bonjour, amour.
- Ecoute...
- Te voilà officiellement ma femme.
Bravo!
Je t'avoue que je t'envie un peu.
Cette nuit, c'était une erreur.
Très sexy comme erreur.
Non, c'était une erreur
tout à fait banale.
Pendant un instant,
j'ai ressenti un sentiment de pitié.
Un instant, c'est suffisant.
C'est pourquoi tu reviendras
bientôt en rampant vers Zapp le Grand.
Si tu devais me voir ramper un jour,
ce serait pour te fuir.
Tu es de toute évidence
troublée et amoureuse.
Je vais aller sur Vergon 6 et sauver
ces animaux que ça te plaise ou non!
Tu es libre.
Et tes menaces ne... Quoi?
A mi-chemin vers Vergon 6, tu sentiras
les 1er symptômes de manque.
Et tu reviendras vers moi en rampant
pour une autre nuit de délices.
Bam!
- Kif!
- Oui... Oh!
Oui, Capitaine?
Je l'ai fait avec la femme.
Informes-en les hommes.
Le grassouillet a dit
qu'il ne vous retenait plus.
- Vraiment? Pourquoi?
- On se le demande.
- Il voulait dire quoi?
- Rien.
On prend nos affaires
et on fonce vers la planète?
On a juste parlé, compris?
On a très peu de temps.
La planète devrait s'effondrer dans...
depuis deux heures.
Serpent Fruit Mauve.
Crevette Venteuse
Centaure Imitateur
Bonjour, toi.
Tu n'es pas sur la liste.
Alors on peut le bouffer?
Au barbecue!
Je mettrai mon tablier désopilant.
Non, je n'en ai rien à faire
de ton tablier. On ne le mangera pas!
Ton nom sera "Nibbler".
Je vais allumer le barbecue.
J'espère qu'il ne risque rien
avec ces gros animaux.
Quand ma femme sera là, je ne pourrai
plus me consacrer à mes hommes.
Quel dommage, monsieur.
Alors profitons du temps
qu'il nous reste.
Bon, d'accord.
Grattez-moi juste un peu le dos.
J'ai trouvé un couple
d'hermaflamants roses.
C'est la dernière espèce.
- Hein?
- Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire?
Je le crois pas, on a traversé
la galaxie et risquer nos vies...
pour lui donner à bouffer!
Il mérite une bonne rouste.
Ce n'est pas sa faute si c'est
une insatiable machine à tuer.
Ne crains rien, je suis là.
La planète s'effondre!
Vite, décollage.
On n'a plus d'essence.
Je t'avais dit de faire le plein.
Je le ferai en rentrant.
Heureusement que Zapp n'est pas loin.
Oublie-le! Je refuse
de retourner vers lui en rampant.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes?
Rien. On a juste parlé.
C'est pas
comme si t'avais couché avec!
Oh, non, c'est pas vrai!
Comment t'as pu, Leela?
Je te croyais plus exigeante!
Ce mec est une tâche, un vrai gorille.
Tu crois pas que je me sens déjà
assez mal comme ca?
Non!
Très bien, je vais le contacter.
Puisque vivre a l'air d'être important
pour vous.
Vous ne serez donc
jamais capitaine.
TRANSMISSION
DE L'EXTERIEUR
Allô, Zapp?
- C'est la belle Leela.
- On n'a plus de carburant.
Et Vergon 6 va imploser.
On a besoin de ton aide.
Alors on rampe vers le grand Z tel
un oiseau sur le ventre. Délicieux.
- Les oiseaux ne rampent pas.
- Certains, si.
Tu comptes venir nous sauver ou pas?
Pourrais-tu le demander
plus sensuellement?
Z, je t'en prie?
Mais avant,
tu te débarrasses de cette bête.
C'est la loi.
Et la loi de Brannigan, c'est comme
l'amour de Brannigan: Dur et rapide.
Balance ce rat dehors
et on viendra vous sauver.
Je refuse de laisser
un animal sans défense.
Je croyais que tu n'étais
qu'un bouffon pompeux.
Puis j'ai réalisé
que tu n'étais qu'un enfant.
Maintenant je réalise
que tu n'es qu'un bouffon pompeux!
Et lequel t'a fait connaître
le 7 ème ciel?
Comment tu l'as jeté! J'imagine
que t'as un plan de secours.
On va rester là et attendre la mort.
Ca, je peux le faire!
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
Incroyable,
c'est de la matière obscure!
Avec la boulette qu'il vient
de larguer, on peut faire le plein?
C'est son espèce
qui a produit la matière obscure.
C'est ça, hein, mon trésor?
On a assez de carburant
pour rentrer chez nous.
Bender, va la mettre
dans le moteur.

PROTEGER SON NEZ
On a réussi!
Des animaux ont survécu au désastre!
Des animaux ont survécu
et Leela s'est enfin éclatée.
C'est ce que j'appelle
une mission réussie.
On est des héros!
Cher journal: Je n'ai pas trouvé
l'amour dans cette mission...
mais j'ai trouvé un compagnon
qui fait du carburant pour fusée.
Et c'est tout aussi bien.
Journal du Capitaine,
date stellaire...
Le 13 avril.
13 avril. Point deux.
Moi, Zap, j'ai été mis en échec.
Mais j'ai couché
avec une superbe extraterrestre.
Finalement, n'est-ce pas tout ce
dont les hommes rêvent...
depuis qu'ils ont regardé
vers les étoiles?
Kif, je te pose une question.

Que penses-tu de la vue, Fry?
Ca remet les choses à leur place.
Vu d'ici, un monde tout entier
peut paraître insignifiant.
Avec des extraterrestres
complètement nues
Terreur sur la Planète Robot
On est bien placés! D'ici...
quand on lance une bouteille
sur un joueur, on l'assomme.
J'y comprends rien. Le blernsball,
c'est comme le baseball?
Le baseball? Dieu nous en préserve.
Le baseball était aussi ennuyeux
que le tricot ou la tapisserie.
- Maintenant c'est plus vivant.
- Ennuyeux? Ce n'était pas...
Ils l'ont rendu vivant?
C'est pas ça?
Dehors!
Pourquoi la balle est accrochée
à un élastique?
C'est traditionnel, comme les battes
en aluminium et les gants en cuir.
Je vais me ramener un souvenir!
Tiens, petit, je te le donne.
Un beignet de calamar géant.
On n'en a pas.
Alors donnez-moi un de vos jeunes
dans un sandwich.
Il n'y a plus de sandwich.
Bien, donnez-moi juste quelque chose
plein de bactéries.
Les hot dogs, eux, n'ont pas changé.
- Les potes, qui veut du pop-corn?
- Volontiers!
Je vous mets du beurre?
Je pige les règles du jeu.
Les blerns sont attribués:
3 blerns, 2 anti-blerns et celui
du milieu est neutre, c'est ça?
Excepté le mot "blern",
je n'ai rien compris.
3ème balle bloquée
Multi-balle! Multi-balle!
Blern! Blern!
Super! Oui!
Miller va marquer 70 blerns.
Il est bon, mais il est loin
de Clem Johnson...
qui jouait avant que les injections
de stéroïdes soient obligatoires.
Ce pauvre humain n'aurait pas tenu
s'il avait joué en Ligue des Robots.
Alors que Joe "Guili-guili" Jackson
est une machine à marquer des points.
Exactement, c'était une machine
conçue pour jouer aux Blerns.
Joe n'était qu'une batte programmable
sur roulettes.
Et ses frappes à 300/h, ça venait
de son microprocesseur?
Vous avez la trouille
de vous mesurer à nous.
- On peut pas aller sur le terrain.
- Mais il y a plein de robots.
Ouais, pour les boulots ingrats:
Porteur de batte, polisseur
de balle, systèmes d'arrosage.
Mais il y en a combien
qui entraînent?
- Onze?
- Zéro!
Tiens! Regarde qui vient
nettoyer les saletés!
C'est un petit enfant humain?
Seigneur Dieu!
Ca ne va pas?
C'est mon nouveau "pager".
C'est Hermes. Un colis est arrivé.
Vous devez tous retourner au bureau.
Laisse-moi tranquille, saleté.
Eteignez-moi vite!
Excusez-moi?
On se voit au bureau!
Admettez-le...
pour vous, les robots ne servent
qu'à vous faciliter la vie.
C'est pas ça?
Je n'ai jamais facilité la vie
de personne, tu le sais bien!
Grande nouvelle. Vous avez un colis
à livrer sur Chapek 9.
Un monde où les humains
sont tués sur-le-champ.
- En quoi c'est une grande nouvelle?
- Je suis ravi de ta question.
Chapek 9 a été colonisé,
il y a des siècles...
par un dangereux groupe armé
de robots séparatistes.
Si des robots tuent des humains,
on dit qu'ils sont dangereux.
D'accord, les robots détestent
les humains.
Et les humanoïdes extraterrestres?
C'est pareil.
C'est pourquoi Bender
devrait y aller.
C'est encore le robot
qui va se taper tout le boulot.
C'est ton 1er vrai travail
depuis que tu es là.
Je ne le ferai pas.
C'est jour férié pour les robots.
C'est férié? Et pourquoi?
C'est Robanukah. La fête la plus
sacrée du calendrier robotique.
Je t'en prie. Il y a un mois,
c'était le Robamadan...
et avant, Robnoël.
- La cuite qu'on s'est prise!
- C'était plus que ça.
C'était un hommage
à mes ancêtres prototypes...
qui a pris la forme d'une beuverie.
Je respecte votre différence
car la loi m'y oblige...
mais vous avez pris tous vos congés
lors de votre roberculose.
D'accord, je vais y aller.
Mais je garderai une dent
contre vous...
jusqu'à la fin de vos jours.
Voilà qui est réglé.
Je vous souhaite un bon voyage.
Alors cette planète
est complètement inhabitée?
Non, elle est habitée par des robots.
Comme un entrepôt est habité
par des caisses.
Maintenant au travail, Bender.
Oui, Madame Leela.
Tout de suite, Madame Leela.
A vos ordres, Madame Leela.
On ne peut pas se poser
car les robots nous tueraient.
On va rester et te descendre
avec le treuil.
Et tu ne connais pas d'humains,
tu ne travailles pas pour eux...
et surtout, tu les détestes.
J'essaierai de m'en souvenir.
Il a l'air très en colère.
J'aurais les boules si je devais
aller sur une planète inhabitée.
Préparons-lui une fête.
Voilà.
Cet abruti de robot verra
que l'on tient à lui.
Bender a sûrement livré le colis.
Ils savent que je travaille
pour les humains et...
Oh, non!
- Mon Dieu! Il faut aller l'aider.
- Non, ils nous tueraient.
On fait quoi alors?
Je n'en sais rien.
C'est pas une décision facile.
J'aimerais 2 ou 3 minutes
pour y réfléchir.
Pour sauver Bender, il faut
ressembler et agir comme des robots.
A vos ordres, je suis prêt.
On doit marcher et parler comme
des robots et éventuellement...
résoudre des équations compliquées.
Je sais danser comme un robot,
ça peut servir?
Fry. Premièrement, c'est sérieux
et deuxièmement...
On est nuls, on aurait dû acheter
nos costumes dans une boutique.
- Mais il n'y a pas de commerce.
- Halte!
Etes-vous robots ou humains?
Robots, nous sommes.
On est deux robots tout ce
qu'il y a de plus robotique.
Faisons leur passer le test.
Que préférez-vous:
A: Un petit chien?
B: Une fleur de votre fiancée?
Ou C: Une banque de donnée
soigneusement formatée?
Choisissez!
- Le chien a des parties mécaniques?
- Non, il est ordinaire.
Alors, la banque de données.
- Correct.
- La fleur était recevable.
Vous pouvez passer.
Si tu vois des robots, ne reste pas
dans leur chemin.
Jusque-là, tout va bien.
- A droite. C'est bon.
- Auriez-vous vu ce robot?
Je ne peux pas vous aider.
Attention!
Ne le mets pas là!
Je t'en prie,
marche comme un robot.
- J'ai envie d'aller aux toilettes.
- Les robots n'ont pas de toilettes.
Ils se cachent où
pour fumer au lycée?
Va faire derrière ces poubelles.
Moi, je surveille.
Dépêche-toi, Fry!
Savez-vous que vous perdez
de l'huile à une vitesse alarmante?
- Je peux colmater ça au silicone.
- Ca va se colmater tout seul.
Attendez.
Voilà, c'est bon.
Attendez. Oui, ça y est.
Quel genre de robot refuse
un colmatage gratuit au silicone?
On doit aller accomplir des tâches
répétitives et sans intérêt.
Une soirée romantique en perspective,
je vous laisse.
- Arrêtons les humanoïdes.
- Arrêtons les intrus.
Alerte, intrus.
Vite, cachons-nous ici!
LA CHOSE DE LA PLANETE TERRE
On interrompt ce programme
pour vous dire...
qu'un être non-métallique est dans
le secteur de rencontre des amoureux.
Dis, Wendy, ta carrosserie est
éraflée. Je peux la polir pour toi?
T'as entendu?
On aurait dit un humain.
Détends-toi, les humains
ne s'attaqueront pas à notre ville.
On ne court aucun risque
à baisser notre garde.
Je vais te manger, te digérer tout
entier avec mon système organique!
Regarde!
La 3D est super!
Moi, ça ne marche pas.
Amusant, n'est-ce pas?
L'humain était insensible
à nos champs magnétiques...
et pour finir un inoffensif bâton
pointu aura eu raison de lui.
- Enfin le cauchemar est fini.
- Il ne finira jamais.
Les humains hantent encore
nos parcs, nos avenues...
et peut-être même
nos salles de cinéma!
Dieu nous garde!
Bon, essayons de trouver Bender.
Alors vous avez aimé le film?
Trop romantique,
il n'y a pas assez d'humains tués.
C'est une histoire à l'eau de rose.
C'est quoi?
Comment ca? Il est 5 h...
l'heure de la chasse
aux humains.
Reste dans la foule. Ils ne doivent
pas voir à quel point tu es bidon.
- C'est pas gentil.
- Je suis de l'autre côté.
On a vu un humain vidanger
derrière les poubelles 738.
La nuit, ils dévissent nos écrous
et les mangent au petit-déjeuner.
Bienvenue à cette chasse
particulière.
On a un invité dont la haine
pour les humains...
me ferait passer
pour un sympathisant.
Un nouveau réfugié de la Terre,
faites un triomphe...
à Bender!
C'est lui, il s'en est sorti!
Trouver les humains!
C'est bon d'entendre
le son de sa voix.
On m'a traité d'extrémiste
quand je prêchais...
l'extermination des humains...
et des singes les plus évolués.
Après avoir vécu sur Terre,
je peux affirmer que j'étais...
beaucoup trop gentil.
Mon Dieu! Il est devenu méchant.
Enfin, encore plus méchant.
Merci. Si vous avez aimé
mon discours...
vous pouvez le retrouver
sur mon album.
18,95 dollars seulement.
Achetez-le et vous recevrez
cette figurine de Bender qui parle.
Et mon cul, c'est du poulet?
Que la chasse commence!
L'humain de base mesure
entre 1 m et 7,5 m.
Il a une carrosserie velue,
enveloppée dans un T-shirt.
C'est vrai que s'ils nous mordent
le cou...
- on devient humain?
- Bien sûr.
- Rien dans le piège?
- Rien du tout.
Les humains préfèrent les appâts
peu caloriques.
Ca nous fait 146000 chasses
infructueuses d'affilée.
Mais j'ai un bon pressentiment
pour demain.
Attendez, c'est quoi là-bas?
C'était une librairie pour adultes.
Il y a rien sauf quelques revues
pornographiques.
C'est le genre d'endroit qui attire
les humains. Je vais voir.
Tu sais que t'es une sacrée cochonne.
Quoi? C'est vous?
- Vous faites quoi ici?
- On est venus pour toi.
On les a vus t'arrêter
car t'étais un sympathisant.
Je m'en suis sorti.
Ils m'ont relâché quand j'ai dit
que j'avais tué plein d'humains.
Bien, retournons au vaisseau.
- Pourquoi?
- On vient te sauver.
- Mais je ne veux pas.
- Quoi?
J'aime cette planète.
Je suis riche et célèbre...
ce qui m'ouvre les portes
de tout un monde de débauche.
Mais on est tes amis.
Mes amis? Ca active
mon programme d'hilarité.
Je suis une machine. Vous êtes
autant ami avec moi...
qu'avec le grille-pain, la chaîne
ou la chaise électrique.
C'est faux.
Je le ressens comme ca.
Salut, Bender. Tu vas me manquer.
Arrête. Filez d'ici avant
de vous faire choper.
Bonne nouvelle.
Votre album est disque d'or.
- Mais
- Ce sont les humains!
Mais faites quelque chose!
Je vous tiens!
Humains assoiffés de liquide!
COUR DE JUSTICE
Votre honneur, je prouverai avec une
marge d'erreur inférieure à 0,5%...
que ces humains sont coupables
du crime d'être humains.
A la réflexion, j'en ai terminé.
Merci, M. Le procureur.
Je vais examiner les preuves.
Jugement...
On n'a pas le droit à un avocat?
Pour lui, l'affaire est classée,
mais moi, je ne suis pas humaine.
Vous êtes presque humaine!
Erreur système, redémarrez.
Il a encore planté.
Faites contrôle-alt-échappe.
- C'est peut-être l'interface.
- Il faut éteindre et rallumer.
- Nettoyez la souris.
- Appelez le support technique!
C'est bon, il remarche.
Je déclare les accusés coupables.
Regardez, je n'ai qu'un œil.
Comptez-le! Je suis humaine?
Les humains vivront sur cette planète
comme les robots sur Terre.
Ils feront des calculs
et assembleront des voitures...
puis finiront dans une école
d'un quartier défavorisé.
Félicitations, vous avez ravivé
notre haine ancestrale des humains!
- Ca va?
- Ouais.
- Qui êtes-vous?
- On est les robots anciens.
Vous n'avez pas l'air âgés.
Merci, on essaie
de rester en forme.
- Que fait-on ici?
- Silence! Faites venir Bender!
Vite, j'ai une séance de dédicace
au centre commercial.
Ca veut dire quoi?
Silence! Il est temps
de les exécuter.
Mais le juge nous a condamnés!
Silence! C'est une mascarade
pour le public.
On est les maîtres de cette planète.
Construits par les robots fondateurs,
il y a plus de quatre siècles.
Silence! Approche, Bender.
Tu vas avoir l'honneur
de les exécuter.
Silence! Je suis d'accord.
Sers-toi du machin-à-tuer cérémonial.
J'ai un coup de barre.
Une bonne dérouillée, ça suffit pas?
Non, les anciens ont parlé.
Montre-nous ces talents de tueur
qui ont fait de toi une star.
Tue-les avant qu'ils ne détruisent
notre société!
- Fais-le!
- Fais-le!
Je ne peux pas les tuer.
Plein d'humains maltraitent
les robots, mais pas eux.
Ce sont mes amis.
Les humains ne sont pas une menace.
Ils sont bêtes et lâches.
C'est bien vrai!
Il faut l'avouer, les humains
sont inoffensifs.
- On sait tout ca.
- Ah bon?
Ils sont des bouc émissaires pour
que le peuple oublie ses problèmes.
Comme cette pénurie d'écrous.
Ou que les anciens sont corrompus.
Ca, c'est vrai.
Tais-toi, Jimmy.
Maintenant qu'on s'est parlés
franchement, on va pouvoir rentrer.
Silence! Vous en savez trop.
Anciens? Exécutez fonction contrôle,
majuscule, tuer.
Stop!
Un pas de plus et je crache
du feu sur vous!
Il le ferait, il est cinglé!
On l'a inventé, non?
Bon sang, je ne me souviens plus.
C'était dans ce film stupide.
L'original ou le remake?
Les prisonniers s'enfuient!
Adieu, abrutis!
Salut, les abrutis.
Une seconde.
J'ai oublié de livrer le colis.
Des écrous! Il pleut des écrous!
Hourra pour les humains!
J'arrive pas à croire
que vous ayez fait ça pour moi.
C'est le plus beau Robanukah!
On voulait te montrer qu'on respecte
la culture robotique.
Merci. Vous saviez pourtant que j'ai
inventé ça pour ne pas travailler.
Bien sûr.
Ca ne lui enlève pas son importance.
Dans ce cas, on va danser!
Vous êtes vachement forts.
Comment vous faites ca?

J'en ai marre! Ca fait des heures
que j'entends ce boucan!
Vous pouvez faire moins de bruit!
Excusez-nous!
CHARGEMENT...
50 millions de $ d'anchois
Bonjour, jeunes gens.
J'espŤre que vous Ítes prÍts
pour l'examen de fin d'annťe.
Pardon, j'ai manquť des cours.
C'est quoi comme matiŤre?
AlgŤbre ťgyptien en hiťroglyphes.
Mais c'est un cauchemar!
M. Fry, on vient au cours en slip?
Jeune homme, je crois
que c'est le moment...
pour tout vous apprendre
sur les slips Lightspeed.
Lightspeed convient ŗ la vie
actuelle que ce soit au travail...
ou dans l'intimitť.
Lightspeed: Style et confort pour
les fesses qui font la diffťrence.
Quel drŰle de rÍve, je pourrai
jamais me rendormir.
On diffuse des pubs
dans les rÍves des gens?
- Bien sŻr.
- Comment c'est possible?
C'est trŤs simple.
Elles sont injectťes dans ton cerveau
comme le liquide dans cet úuf.
Dans la rťalitť, c'est pas du liquide
mais des radiations gamma.
Mais c'est un lavage de cerveau!
- La pub n'existait pas avant?
- Si, mais pas dans nos rÍves.
Seulement ŗ la tťlť et ŗ la radio.
Et dans les magazines...
dans les boÓtes aux lettres,
au cinťma, dans les bus...
sur les stylos, les T-shirts,
les bananes ou ťcrites dans le ciel.
Mais pas dans nos rÍves, Áa non.
ArrÍte de r‚ler,
personne ne te force ŗ acheter.
On a tous des pubs dans nos rÍves.
Mais on ne se rue pas dans
les magasins dŤs l'annonce de soldes.
Dťsirez-vous essayer ce parfum
de Calvin Clone?
Non, merci.
- Et vous, monsieur?
- Non, merci...
COSMETIQUES
Quel ravissant visage!
Il faut juste dťtourner l'attention
de la zone de l'úil.
SLIPS LIGHTSPEED
Je peux essayer?
Interdiction d'enlever l'emballage.
Mais essayez le slip
de dťmonstration.
MIROIR AMELIORANT
ACCESSOIRES POUR ROBOTS
Super, ton nouveau pull.
Quel nouveau pull?
Je suis venu avec.
D'ailleurs, je ne vous connais pas.
30 $, s'il vous plaÓt.
Mais j'ai pas les moyens!
A moins que... vous prenez la Visa?
Visa n'existe plus depuis 500 ans.
- American Express?
- 600 ans.
- La carte Dťcouverte?
- Ce n'est pas une carte de paiement.
T'as craquť sur un Lightspeed?
C'est classe.
Non, j'ai pas les moyens.
Etre beauf, Áa craint.
Ils font de la pub
pour des trucs inabordables.
Tais-toi, ils vont en diffuser une.
Bonjour. C'est moi, m'man.
C'est qui cette vieille dame?
C'est m'man, la plus importante
industrielle sur Terre.
Quand mes robots grincent
telles de vieilles charniŤres...
je leur donne une ration
de mon huile ŗ l'ancienne pour robot.
Dťlicieuse.
Et n 'oubliez pas,
elle contient 10% en plus d'amour...
que celle de mon concurrent.
"M'man", "Amour" et "CharniŤre"
sont des marques dťposťes.
Vu le bruit que tu fais,
tu devrais essayer.
- Repťrť!
- Plus un geste, robot!
Attendez, vous devez
vous tromper de personne.
Je suis sŻr qu'il y a...
Je disais, je suis sŻr
qu'il y a une erreur...
D'ailleurs, vous n'avez...
aucune raison...
On a assez pour payer l'amende
de Bender?
78. 79. 79,50...
Zut! Il nous manque 50 cents.
J'aurais pu aider, mais Bender
a volť mon portefeuille.
C'est mon ancienne banque!
Mon compte est peut-Ítre
encore ouvert.
On n'a pas d'empreinte rťtinienne,
ni digitale, ni radio du cŰlon.
Normal, j'ai ouvert ce compte
en 1998. J'ai ma carte de retrait.
Vous vous rappelez votre code?
C'ťtait le prix d'une pizza avec soda
ŗ la Pizza Pinucci.
Bon, il vous reste 93 cents.
C'est super!
Plus 2% d'intťrÍt
sur une pťriode de 1000 ans...
ce qui fait 4,3 milliards de dollars.
FELICITATIONS, FRY!
Je sais que Fry est riche,
mais pourquoi ces chapeaux?
Tu ne vois pas
ŗ quel point il est riche?
En fait, on devrait mÍme
porter un monocle.
- C'est moi qui offre les pizzas!
- Ouais!
Sauf si la note dťpasse 50 millions.
J'ai pas toute la journťe,
je vous sers quelle pizza?
Une avec un peu de tout
sauf des anchois.
Et une avec ma garniture prťfťrťe:
Des anchois.
Sťlection non reconnue.
Je n'ai pas compris.
Vous savez ces petits poissons
sans tÍte.
Erreur programme. Erreur programme.
Je regrette, mais l'espŤce
s'est ťteinte vers l'an 2200.
Oui, pÍchť jusqu'au dernier.
A peu prŤs quand votre peuple
est arrivť, hein, Zoidberg?
On n'est pas au tribunal.
Alors aucun de vous n'y a goŻtť?
Vous savez pas ce que vous manquez.
Salťs et huileux,
ca fondait dans la bouche...
ArrÍtez! Je le reconnais!
On les a tous mangťs!
On se disait: "Encore une, Áa ne se
verra pas". On a tout mangť, pardon!
J'aurais juste aimť
vous faire goŻter.
Ma richesse ne fera pas revenir
toutes les choses du 20Ťme siŤcle.
Dois-je te rappeler l'ťtendue
de ta fortune?
AUTHENTIQUES APPARTEMENTS
AVEC AMIANTE D'ORIGINE
Vous en dites quoi?
Ca t'a coŻtť beaucoup d'argent,
mais c'est trŤs primitif.
Le sol est fait d'un bois si dur!
Tu devrais te dťbarrasser de cette
saletť de tťlť du 20Ťme siŤcle!
Et pourquoi?
Elle provoque le cancer des yeux,
en plus l'image est basse dťfinition.
Avec cette tťlť, je parie qu'on peut
pas voir mon tatouage cochon.
C'est adorable.
- Adjugť!
- Ouais!
Je ne pige pas.
Qui ťtait ce Ted Danson?
Pourquoi payer 10000 $
pour son squelette?
- J'ai une idťe pour une sitcom.
- Laisse-le tranquille.
Il pŤte les plombs avec son argent.
C'est pas grave.
Tu dis ca car il t'a achetť
ce jouet robot de son ťpoque.
Ouais. Ce que c'est mignon!
Le dernier article sera
cette boÓte intacte...
d'anchois du Norvťgien en ColŤre
datťe de 1997.
Des anchois!
La derniŤre boÓte connue, garantie
fraÓche et encore comestible.
Ai-je entendu 10000 $?
- 15000!
- 20!
- 30. Non, 40!
- 50000!
- T'es dingue? C'est une conserve.
- Ne me dis pas ce que je dois faire.
- 50. Une fois, deux fois...
- 75000.
C'est m'man! C'est la 1Ťre fois
que je la vois en vrai.
100000!
Tu ne peux pas lutter contre elle.
C'est la personne
la plus riche du monde.
Et elle est tellement adorable.
Je suppose que je peux encore
surenchťrir, 300000!
- 500!
- Bontť divine. Un million.
- Deux. Quatre.
- Six.
On dirait que le jeune homme
a trŤs envie de ces anchois.
Mais j'en donne 23 millions.
Un "jillion" de dollars!
Monsieur, ce n'est pas un chiffre.
Dans ce cas, 50 millions.
Mes petits, votre vieille mŤre
reconnaÓt sa dťfaite.
Vous gagnez. Je ne suis pas
de taille contre vous.
Quel geste ťlťgant! Adjugť...
ŗ celui qui a achetť tous les
articles de la vente d'aujourd'hui.
Un bon programme de tťlť
du 20Ťme siŤcle.
Vous souvenez-vous
quand les cookies...
sortaient tout chauds du four?
Petridge Farm s 'en souvient.
Si je m'en souviens!
Vous souvenez-vous
quand les femmes ne votaient pas...
et quand des gens ťtaient interdits
sur les parcours de golf?
Petridge Farm s 'en souvient.
Fry, tu es lŗ?
Tu n'es pas venu travailler,
oý ťtais-tu?
Je suis restť ici. J'ai repris ma vie
lŗ oý je l'avais laissťe.
Excusez-moi, mais il est 8 h, l'heure
d'en prendre plein les oreilles.
Tu ne peux pas rester lŗ ŗ ťcouter
de la musique classique.
Si, jusqu'ŗ ce que tu ťteignes
la stťrťo.
Ce n'est pas sain.
Tu vis dans le passť.
Je suis riche.
Je vis ŗ l'ťpoque oý je veux.
Mais on est tes amis
et on vit en l'an 3000.
Alors tu viens avec nous
au combat de calamars...
ou tu restes avec tes merdes
prťhistoriques?
Des merdes?
Vous pouvez pas comprendre...
mais j'ai trouvť ce qui me manquait,
c'est pas des amis mais des choses.
Je suis une chose.
Laissez-moi tranquille.
Fry, je t'en prie!
Ma queue de cheval est coincťe.
J'ai pas besoin d'eux.
J'ai la tťlť de mon ťpoque
et mes cheeseburger fossilisťs...
et ma boÓte d'anchois de 50 millions.
Bontť divine, quelle journťe!
Peux-tu refermer, Edner?
Je sens comme un lťger courant d'air.
Cette maudite robe me gratte!
Walt! Un jus de fruit!
Tout de suite.
Larry, apporte un jus ŗ m'man.
Mais elle a dit...
Tu obťis.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
- J'enrage ŗ cause de ces anchois!
Ce salopard doit connaÓtre
leur secret.
J'aurai cette boÓte,
je vous en fais le serment.
Personne n'est de taille
contre m'man.
Toi, la ferme!
Vous le savez, la pierre
angulaire de mon empire...
est mon huile pour robot
ŗ l'ancienne.
Imaginez, dix milliards de robots...
qui doivent faire une vidange
tout les 5000 km.
Le calcul est vite fait, Áa rapporte
un paquet d'oseille.
Je peux essayer ta robe?
Non, Edner! L‚che Áa!
Je ne vois pas le rapport
avec les anchois?
J'y arrive ŗ ces saletťs d'anchois.
Un goutte d'huile naturelle
d'anchois...
pourrait lubrifier 10 robots
de faÁon permanente.
Dommage que l'espŤce soit ťteinte.
Au contraire,
ne dis pas de sottises!
Merci, Walt.
Si quelqu'un retrouvait l'ADN
de l'anchois...
il pourrait en extraire le gŤne
fabriquant l'huile...
le greffer ŗ des gamins
du tiers-monde et bam:
Une huile excellente ŗ bas prix.
Ce qui conduirait votre m'man
ŗ la faillite.
Mon Dieu, ce M. Fry est un gťnie.
Esther, tu es trop moche!
Je ne vois qu'une solution.
On doit ruiner M. Fry afin qu'il nous
vende cette boÓte d'anchois!
Je vous trouve rťellement
machiavťlique.
Surtout ne l'oubliez jamais.
Comment on sort son argent
de la banque?
C'est le plus facile,
gr‚ce ŗ mon gentil personnel...
de vidťo surveillance.
Vous vous rappelez votre code?
C'ťtait le prix d'une pizza
avec soda ŗ la Pizza Pinucci.
Le prix d'une pizza avec soda...
- Vous savez quoi faire.
- Quoi?
Dťcouvrir son numťro
de code, abrutis!
Je pars pour un gala de charitť
en faveur d'adolescentes enceintes.
C'est les trois plombiers
que vous avez appelťs.
On vient resserrer votre joint
de culasse.
Je n'ai pas demandť...
Vite! Donne-lui le somnifŤre!
En voilŗ un gentil garÁon.
On se rťveille, M. Fry.
Je suis oý?
Vous Ítes en l'an 2000,
ŗ la pizza Pinucci.
Vous vous Ítes endormi
en travaillant.
C'est tout ŗ fait moi,
mais j'ai pas ťtť congelť?
J'ai pas ťtť dans le futur?
Non, vous avez rÍvť
que vous ťtiez en l'an 3000.
Je suis revenu? C'est ce
que je voulais, enfin je crois.
- Qui Ítes-vous?
- Je suis M. Pinucci.
Mais vous n'aviez pas
de moustache hier?
Non. Allez tenir la caisse, je crois
que j'entends un client arriver.
J'ai dit: "Je crois que j'entends
un client arriver!"
Vite, je dois retourner
au musťe des tÍtes.
Ca ne sera pas long.
Je vous rappelle que vous Ítes
en 2000, vous avez votre tÍte...
et vous voulez une pizza au fromage.
Je fais Áa pour que ma tÍte soit
reconnue comme vťritable actrice.
C'est cool, il y a des anchois.
Oui, l'espŤce n'est pas
encore ťteinte.
Et s'il vous faut encore une preuve
qu'on est bien 1000 ans avant...
voici la grande actrice
contemporaine, Pamela Anderson.
Tu m'as vue dans
Alerte ŗ Malibu: Le film?
C'est le 1er film tournť
entiŤrement au ralenti!
Vous ne l'avez pas encore tournť.
Alors il ignore que j'ai eu
un oscar? Zut!
Vous Ítes Pamela Anderson?
Cool! Que dťsirez-vous?
Une pizza au fromage et un grand...
- Texte!
- Soda!
C'est Áa! Une pizza au fromage
et un grand soda.
Je voudrais une...
- Il a fait vite.
- Combien je vous dois?
10,77 $.
Comme mon numťro de code.
BientŰt tu rigoleras moins.
Merci mille fois!
PlutŰt 4,3 milliards de fois.
Quel cauchemar! J'ťtais en 2000
et vous n'aviez jamais existť.
Je suis content que vous soyez lŗ.
Depuis quand on compte pour toi?
Tu n'aimes que les anchois et les
chansons ringardes sur les fesses.
Non, c'est faux!
Au revoir!
Ce rÍve vous est offert
par les slips Lightspeed!
Bender, Leela, ne m'abandonnez pas!
Une minute. On est en quelle annťe?
3000.
Ouais, je suis toujours
dans le futur!
La vie est merveilleuse!
Oý vous emportez mes affaires?
ChŤque refusť. On reprend tout.
Ma carte de retrait!
Mon numťro de code: 1077.
Je n'ai plus rien.
Exceptť...
Vous Ítes de sa famille. Vous savez
pourquoi il a disjonctť?
Quoi?
La folie est frťquente dans la
famille, certains me disent fou.
Et pourquoi?
Car j'ai osť rÍver d'une nouvelle
race de monstre atomique!
Des Ítres supťrieurs
avec un corps octogonal...
qui auraient sucť le sang de...
Leela! Bender! Vous m'avez manquť.
Que t'est-il arrivť?
J'ai ťtť volť.
Ils ont tout piquť exceptť ceci.
Qui?
Bonjour, Fry.
C'est m'man!
Je suis embÍtťe
pour vos problŤmes d'argent.
Je pourrais aider un charmant jeune
homme en lui rachetant ses anchois.
Dťsolť, elles ne sont pas ŗ vendre.
Quoi? Ecoute, petit enfoirť!
Je contrŰle le marchť de l'huile,
c'est pas toi qui va me ruiner!
Combien?
Vous pouvez ranger votre chťquier,
j'ai trouvť un truc plus important:
Mes amis. Et, eux, ils ne m'ont pas
coŻtť un cent.
Voilŗ pourquoi ces anchois
iront dans une pizza...
pour partager la bouffe que j'aime
avec des gens que j'adore.
Quoi? Vous allez les manger?
Surtout, n'en laissez pas
une miette. Bon appťtit.
Au revoir!
- Crťtin.
- Quelle gentille vieille dame!
OK, mes amis.
Vous allez dťguster la plus
dťlicieuse des espŤces disparues.
Ce n'est pas sŻr,
j'ai dťjŗ goŻtť du veau.
Beurk!
C'est dťgueu au dťbut,
mais aprŤs on s'y fait.
Cette puanteur!
Cette puanteur paradisiaque!
Encore.
Il n'y en a plus
et il n'y en aura plus jamais.
Encore! Encore!
Encore!

La cuisine d'Elzar
Bonsoir et bienvenue.
Vous n 'avez pas besoin d'aller sur
Neptune pour manger leurs spécialités.
Aujourd'hui, je vous apprendrai
la fricassée...
de limace neptunienne en gelée.
Graissez un plat et préchauffez votre
four ŕ 3500 degrés...
séparez le jaune d'une
aubergine transgénique...
et vous relevez avec une dose
de poivre en furet.
Que regardes-tu?
- Rien.
- Une émission culinaire?
Non, bien sűr que non.
Un strip robot.
Ouais, voilŕ, c'est ça!
J'ignorais que tu aimais faire
la cuisine. C'est mignon!
C'est vrai. Je cache ce secret
depuis si longtemps.
- Ca craint pas. J'aime ça, moi aussi.
- Gonzesse.
L 'ingrédient le plus important
est ce bel animal...
la limace neptunienne.
On en trouve en conserve
mais pour faire ça bien...
on doit en étrangler, une vivante,
soi-męme.
Voilŕ pourquoi il faut toujours
avoir des casseroles en fonte.
BUREAUCRATE
ENGUEULADE
EN COURS
Bender, ça ne peut plus durer.
Cette société vous paie ŕ rester
vautré sur le canapé.
Ca, un canapé, j'exige un oreiller!
Si vous voulez garder un salaire...
il faudra faire plus
que regarder la télé.
- Toi, le cuisinier du vaisseau?
- On va se faire de sacré gueuletons.
Tu aimes les émissions culinaires,
mais tu n'as pas le sens du goűt.
J'éviterais de parler de goűt
si je portais un débardeur pistache.
Et toc!
FILLES, FILLES, EXTRATERRESTRES
C'est ça le "Petit Neptune"?
Les chefs te diront que c'est le coin
pour les bons produits.
Oui, entre autres.
Je t'en prie, pitié, tu peux pas me
faire ça dans l'état oů je suis.
Des organes?
Frais et pręts ŕ ętre transplantés.
C'est quoi ça?
Un śil ŕ rayons X.
Ca voit ŕ travers tout.
Une minute. Il y a marqué "rayon Z".
Z aussi bon, c'est męme mieux.
Deux de plus que X.
Intéressant ce truc.
Vous prenez du liquide?
Fry, il faut ętre plus prudent.
Tu n'es plus au XXčme sičcle.
- Tu connais pas ici.
- Je suis pas un gamin.
J'ai grandi ici.
Je connais ces gens.
- Ca roule?
- Ca glisse.
Il y a tout comme viande ici,
sauf de l'humain.
Vous en voulez?
Quel est ce produit?
De la mandragore, ça vous rend
irrésistible pour le sexe opposé.
C'est ridicule. Je vais
en prendre 2 livres.
JARRETS DE LIMACE
MAGRETS DE LIMACE
Presque limace
Vous auriez de la limace fraîche?
- Jaune ou mauve?
- N'importe.
La mauve donne la diarrhée.
Donnez ce que vous avez.
Oů est passé Fry?
C'est vrai, j'ai du mal ŕ respirer
sous l'eau. Je prends les branchies.
Oui, les branchies.
Vos poumons ne servent plus.
Je ne crois pas.
J'opčre maintenant, je livre
les branchies aprčs.
Infirmičre!
On peut y aller!
Ca risque de faire un peu mal.
Merci.
Tu fais n'importe quoi.
Je t'avais dit de te méfier.
Je peux décider moi-męme. J'aurai pu
ętre plus heureux avec des branchies.
- Bonne nouvelle!
- J'aime pas quand il dit ça.
Nous avons un colis ŕ livrer
sur la plančte Trisol.
Un monde perdu aux confins
de la ténébreuse zone interdite.
Bonsoir et merci.
A-t-on le droit d'entrer
dans cette zone interdite?
Bien sűr. Ce n'est qu'un nom.
Comme la zone de la mort
ou du non-retour.
Elles ont des noms comme ca
dans la galaxie de la Terreur.
- Professeur...
- En route, amusez-vous bien.
- Bender, ce dîner, ça vient?
- C'est presque pręt.
SERVIR L'HOMME
Maintenant, une pincée de sel.
C'est le 1er plat de Bender
et il est assez sensible...
il faut l'encourager.
- Oui.
- O.K.!
Oh, nom d'un chien!
Je n'ai jamais rien mangé
d'aussi salé.
Męme la pizza de Panucci.
C'est de l'eau salée?
C'est du sel
avec un peu d'eau dedans.
Ma vision faiblit. Je vais mourir.
Cette bouffe est irréprochable.
Le niveau de sel est 10%
en dessous de la dose mortelle.
J'aurais pas dű en reprendre.
Fry, voilŕ le colis ŕ livrer.
Pour une fois, sois prudent.
C'est ma 1čre visite dans cette
galaxie et je veux un bon souvenir.
Ne touche rien, ne parle pas.
Va au palais, dépose le colis
et reviens.
J'étais déjŕ livreur avant
que tu sois née.
Je crois que je connais mon métier.
Bravo Bender. J'ai jamais eu
aussi soif.
Allez, va te coucher toi.
Il y a quelqu'un lŕ-dedans?
POUR L'EMPEREUR
La bouteille royale est vide.
Tu as bu notre Empereur!
Non, c'est pas moi!
Tu as bu notre Empereur.
Tu l'as assassiné.
Il avait l'air si bon,
si rafraîchissant.
Tu as raison.
Maintenant il n'est plus
et ton sort est réglé!
Saluons tous le nouvel Empereur!
Nous te saluons, nous te saluons!
Bien que je t'aie dit
de ne toucher ŕ rien...
tu as bu du liquide bleu.
Ca aurait pu ętre du poison.
Ca pouvait aussi bien
ętre un empereur.
Je suis Merg, le grand prętre.
Oserais-je intervenir?
- Osez.
- Je vous conseille humblement...
de choisir un Premier ministre.
Je recommande Gorgak, déjŕ en poste.
Je serai un collaborateur efficace.
J'ai souvent eu envie
d'ętre Premier ministre.
- Je choisis donc Bender.
- Tu es viré, Gorgak.
Ca suffit. Je t'ordonne de revenir
ŕ bord. Tu as perdu la tęte.
Je vais en discuter
avec mon Premier ministre.
Change rien, mon pote.
On a livré ce colis pour vous.
Oh, merci!
NE PAS BOIRE L'EMPEREUR!
Ce truc arrive juste ŕ temps.
Voici votre harem, majesté.
Toutes ces jeunes filles sont
ŕ votre disposition.
Disons celle-lŕ.
J'ignorais
que vos goűts étaient particuliers.
Tout bien réfléchi,
je vais prendre celle-lŕ.
Je ne suis pas lŕ pour juger.
Vous ne trouvez pas ça bizarre
qu'un livreur de 25 ans...
tombe du ciel, tue l'empereur
et soit récompensé plutôt que puni?
Arręte tes allusions.
On sait trčs bien de qui tu parles.
De moi, c'est ça?
On a aucune raison d'avoir peur.
Ces gens semblent trčs doux.
Ils sont doux. Vous trempez vos doigts
dans l'un d'eux.
Vous m'avez touché ŕ des endroits
oů on ne m'avait jamais touché.
Enfin je vous trouve.
Nous devons préparer
le couronnement de demain.
Un gala! Je mettrai ma carapace
de soirée.
Fry sera sacré
au coucher des 3 soleils...
lorsque nous passons
en phase nocturne.
Il aura des discours interminables?
Un seul. Les 122
paragraphes du serment impérial...
que vous devrez réciter...
Par cśur.
On aura du gâteau?
GALA DE PRE-COURONNEMENT
Je vous ressers.
Apprętez-vous ŕ rire
ŕ en avoir des fuites.
Voici le meilleur humoriste
politique de la plančte...
Flof.
A quoi reconnaît-on ceux
du soleil orange?
Ils grincent tous.
Nous qui vivons sous le soleil rouge,
nous sommes cool.
C'est vrai, non?
Il est super!
J'ai découvert quelque chose,
ta vie est en danger.
Tu vois Plon?
Il est mort en étant bu par Strug.
Avant de s'essuyer la bouche...
Strug fut bu par Schwab.
- Et?
- Tu leur succčdes.
As-tu une idée de la durée moyenne
de leur rčgne?
- Quatre-vingt-cinq mille ans?
- Une semaine.
Je savais que c'était soit trčs long,
soit trčs court.
Chaque empereur le devient
en assassinant le précédent.
Devine qui est le prochain!
ASSASSIN DE FRY
Mon assassin ne vivra pas longtemps.
Tu ne te rends pas compte
du danger!
La moitié ont été bus
le jour du sacre.
Moi aussi, je compte bien prendre
une cuite.
Non, ils ont été tués.
Tu seras tué si tu fais une erreur
dans le serment.
SERMENT DU SACRE VOL. 1
- J'apprendrai ça tout ŕ l'heure.
- Tu es inconscient.
- Tu ne réfléchis pas avant d'agir?
- Non, ou je ne serai pas empereur.
Je ne serai pas non plus en 3000.
C'est comme avec la sauterelle
et la pieuvre.
La sauterelle ne pense
qu'ŕ accumuler pour l'hiver...
pendant
que la pieuvre regarde la télé.
A l'arrivée de l'hiver,
la sauterelle meurt.
La pieuvre mange ses réserves
et s'achčte une voiture.
Tu comprends?
Je laisse tomber!
Tu vas te faire tuer
et je ne pourrai rien pour toi.
Je t'ai demandé de ne plus me traiter
comme un bébé.
Va-t-en grande sauterelle,
va faire tes réserves!
Assez, je ne t'aiderai plus jamais!
Pour les autres,
je serai dans le vaisseau.
Rien ne peut m'arriver.
Je suis imbuvable.
Tu me lâches!
Peuple de Trisol, j'ai l'honneur de
vous présenter votre nouvel Empereur!
Ca roule?
- Commencez le serment.
- O.K.
Moi, Fry, qui but Bont le Visqueux...
qui but Ungo l'Humide...
qui avala Zorn le Stagnant...
qui déglutit Hudge le Trempé...
qui mangea une soupe
de Throm le Maître.
Je jure solennellement de régner
avec honneur...
Insanité. Intégrité.
Mes félicitations, Majesté.
Veuillez revętir la toge
unisexe de l'Empereur.
Longue vie ŕ Fry le Solide!
Les soleils se couchent. Je vais
pouvoir passer aux alcools forts.
Tu as vu comme ils brillent.
C'est magnifique. Hé, c'est quoi ça?
L'Empereur Bont!
Il est encore en vie.
Bien sűr, je suis vivant. Eventrez
cet imbécile et sortez-moi de lŕ!
J'ai mal au ventre!
Ne les laissez pas s'échapper!
Toi, tu la fermes!
Laissez-nous entrer, Fry doit mourir
pour que Bont vive!
Je fais quoi?
Il faut le sortir avant
qu'ils ne te tuent.
Je vais tout simplement vous passer
ŕ la centrifugeuse...
afin d'extraire les fluides
de Son Altesse.
- Je n'aurai pas les os broyés?
- Mince, les os.
J'oublie toujours
que vous avez des os.
Transpire-le.
Je suis l'Empereur. Je refuse
d'ętre évacué par les aisselles.
Je peux vous vomir ou vous uriner,
c'est mieux?
Oui mais je préfčre la centrifugeuse.
- Si tu le pleurais?
- C'est une super idée!
Bon, ça ou le broyage.
Continuez, messieurs.
La porte commence ŕ céder.
C'est pas gagné.
Je veux pleurer
mais je suis trop macho.
Je vais te faire pleurer, mon pote.
Tu es un rebut de la société,
tu n'arriveras jamais ŕ rien.
J'ai été l'empereur d'une plančte.
Mais il y a des souvenirs
qu'on n'aime pas remuer:
Tous ceux que tu as pu connaître
ou aimer au XXčme, ils sont morts.
Ces choses-lŕ arrivent.
Tu peux préparer ton mouchoir:
Il n'y a pas de Dieu. Toutes
vos croyances humaines sont ridicules.
Tu m'enlčves un sacré poids.
C'est plus dur que prévu
de faire pleurer.
- Tu as fait de ton mieux.
- Me gonfle pas.
La situation est préoccupante.
Appelons Leela au secours.
Le homard, tu la boucles!
C'est une idée, je vais l'appeler.
Elle m'en veut de lui avoir dit
de ne plus m'aider.
Leela n'est pas une fille rancuničre.
- Appel en PCV de...
- Je ne dis pas mon nom ŕ une machine.
Appel accepté.
Fry a des ennuis et a besoin d'aide.
Je t'aime pas, tu m'aimes pas.
- Je t'aime beaucoup.
- Vraiment?
Tu vas aider ou pas?
Pourquoi irai-je aprčs ce...
Attends. Tu peux me dire ce
que tu aimes en moi?
- Elle va venir?
- Pas sűr.
Mais maintenant, je sais que ce
qu'elle aime c'est ma franchise.
C'est quoi?
C'est le presse-agrume impérial.
Il va me filtrer de votre pulpe...
de votre corps déchiqueté.
Pourquoi n'y ai-je pas pensé?
C'est le jour le plus triste de ma
vie. J'arrive toujours pas ŕ pleurer!
Viens voir, c'est Leela!
Il y en a trop. Elle est submergée.
Elle risque sa vie pour moi
aprčs la façon dont je l'ai traitée.
Je ne le mérite pas.
Je me sens trčs mal.
Vraiment?
- Elle va bien?
- J'en sais rien.
Je vais jeter un coup d'śil
par la fenętre.
Mon Dieu, la malheureuse
est hors combat!
Non, non!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu racontes,
Bender, elle...
Ils l'ont jetée dans le
presse-agrume!
Ils mettent des cubes de glace
dans le verre.
C'est pas vrai.
C'est la stricte vérité,
malheureusement.
Je suis désolé mon ami.
Elle est morte.
Tout ce qu'elle voulait
c'était m'aider.
J'étais trop fier et trop bęte
pour l'accepter.
Je voudrais ętre mort ŕ sa place.
Mais qu'est-ce que tu racontes?
- Tu es vivante!
- Bien sűr.
J'ai dit que tu étais morte
pour qu'il pleure.
Tu as tout gâché en survivant.
On a eu que deux larmes.
Mais?
C'était une question de temps.
Je vais arranger ça.
Fry, je pense arriver ŕ nous tirer
de lŕ, si tu me laisses t'aider.
Merci Leela.
Pardonne-moi, j'ai eu tort
de te jeter.
J'ai de la chance
de t'avoir comme amie.
Pourquoi t'as fait ça?
Ca fait mal!
- T'es folle.
- Désolée.
Amy, apporte la bouteille.
- Je comprends.
- Venez, on doit tous aider Fry.
Merci ŕ tous mes amis.
Vous ętes trop cool.
Sans vous...
Arręte, Bender, je suis
trčs sensible de lŕ.
- Qu'est-ce que ça donne Amy?
- Dans 2 heures on a fini.
O.K. C'est votre tour.
Attendez une minute. Qui ętes-vous?
Je suis l'Empereur. Merci
de m'avoir pleuré.
Je vous en prie.
Laissez-m'en un peu.

Grande nouvelle, mes amis.
Demain, vous irez faire une livraison
sur Ebola 13, la planète virale.
- Pourquoi pas aujourd'hui?
- A cause de ce soir.
Je tiens à vous garder en vie.
C'est le symposium
de l'Académie des inventeurs.
- J'adore les symposiums!
- C'est l'événement de la saison.
Les membres présentent leur invention
et la meilleure reçoit un prix.
- Ca a l'air gonflant.
- Pas cette année...
parce que ma dernière
invention est imbattable.
Admirez: Le compteur de vie.
On met un doigt ici et l'ordinateur...
vous dit
combien de temps il vous reste.
- Ca marche vraiment?
- A quelques secondes près...
- à cause du libre-arbitre sans doute.
- Combien de temps il me reste?
Je réserve son lecteur de CD!
Bender est habillé par ROBOTANY 500

ACADEMIE
DES INVENTEURS
Oh mon Dieu, oui!
- Qui c'est ce ringardos?
- Moi, au premier symposium.
Maintenant c'est moi le doyen.
- Ces gamins me doivent le respect.
- Tiens, tiens.
Regardez qui est là
malgré son grand âge.
- Laissez-moi tranquille, Wernstrom.
- Farnsworth, vous êtes dépassé.
Laissez la science à ceux de 120 ans.
Jeune sot, vous croyez tout savoir.
J'inventais des choses
quand vous deveniez sénile.
Rentrez chez vous
avant de vous ridiculiser.
Excusez-moi, je vais faire une sieste
avant la cérémonie.
Qui est ce gland?
Il y a 100 ans, sur Mars, c'était un
de mes plus brillants élèves.
Mais hélas, un jour,
après un contrôle surprise...
A moins, personne ne met A moins
à Ogden Wernstrom!
Désolé mais la présentation compte.
Je jure que je me vengerai,
même si je dois y consacrer 100 ans.
C'était il y a un peu plus de 99 ans
et il ne s'est toujours pas vengé.
Je suis presque à l'abri.
J'ai lu attentivement
votre carte des vins.
Vous me donnerez
un côte de Mars 71...
un Château Partay 77 et un
Mouton Chevitz 66.
Des choix excellents,
monsieur.
Et mélangez-moi tout ça
dans un grand pichet.
Bienvenue à ce nouveau symposium.
Je me présente, Ron Popeil...
je suis l'inventeur de l'eau
lyophilisée, du spray...
et de la technique
de conservation des têtes en bocal.
Et vous êtes gâtés, de grands
inventeurs sont là ce soir.
Accueillons notre jeune étoile
montante, Ogden Wernstrom.
- Bouh!
- Encore du vin!
Chers membres de l'Académie, voici
mon invention: Le scaphandre inversé.
Observez.
Va chercher!
Maintenant, assis.
J'ai dit "assis", vilain poisson!
Ne vous bilez pas, ça ne vaut rien
comparé au compteur de vie.
Qu'allez-vous nous présenter,
grand-père?
Une invention qui remettra
un jeune présomptueux à sa place.
Moins nulle que le compteur de vie,
l'an dernier?
- L'an dernier?
- Oui.
Oh, oh oh.
- Ca vous a rabaissé votre caquet?
- Au contraire.
J'ai ri à en perdre mon dentier.
Oh puis et zut, hein!
Je dois trouver
une nouvelle invention dans les 10 mn.
Je verrai bien
une espèce de compteur de vie!
Professeur?
- Super.
- Epatant!
Et pour finir, une invention
de notre doyen, le Pr Farnsworth.
Professeur?
Encore une seconde, juste une.
On pose les crayons, vieux débris.
Ca y est, j'ai fini. Voilà.
On a déjà le télescope qui permet
de voir des objets lointains...
mais on ne peut pas sentir ces
objets. Maintenant on va pouvoir.
Grâce à ma nouvelle invention...
le flairoscope.
L'odeur passera sur la tache de café,
contournera le noyau d'olive...
et dans cette brûlure de cigare.
Et ça, on dirait que c'est...
un dessin me représentant en cow-boy.
C'est une brillante invention!
Songez aux odeurs astronomiques
que vous sentirez, grâce à moi!
Oh, là là!
J'attends ça depuis 100 ans,
Farnsworth.
Je donne à votre invention
la pire note possible...
un A moins moins, professeur!
Maintenant, le prix. Mes amis, sans
hésitation le vainqueur est...
le Dr Wernstrom,
pour son scaphandre à poisson.
Peut-être qu'à 149 ans, on est
trop vieux pour être scientifique.
- Ouais.
- Non professeur, ne renoncez pas!
Au XXème, j'ai eu souvent envie
de renoncer sans jamais le faire.
Jamais.
Vous m'écoutez ou quoi?
Je renonce.
C'est toi qui a raison. Je vais mettre
en chantier le flairoscope.
Euréka!
Le flairoscope est fini?
Je me suis souvenu
en avoir fabriqué un, l'an dernier.
Vas-y, essaye-le.
Tu verras que chaque corps céleste
possède une odeur spécifique.
Là, je le pointe vers Jupiter.
- Ca sent la mandarine.
- Exactement.
Maintenant, Saturne.
Pin des landes.
La vache, c'est super!
Tant que je n'ai pas à sentir Uranus.
- J'ai pas compris.
- Désolé, Fry.
Les astronomes l'ont rebaptisée en
2660 pour en finir avec cette blague.
- Et quel est son nom?
- Urectum.
Attends, je vais la localiser
pour toi.
Non, je vais sentir au hasard par-là.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
Une si forte puanteur qu'elle envoie
dans le rouge l'odoromètre!
Fry a sans doute découvert l'objet
le plus nauséabond de tout l'univers!
Et si on lui donnait mon nom!
Ca se déplace, on dirait.
L'ordinateur peut peut-être calculer
sa trajectoire.
Mon Dieu, quoi que ce soit,
ca nous arrive droit dessus...
avec assez de puissance pour réduire
la ville en un cratère puant.
Il nous reste environ 72 heures.
Bon, on commence le pillage.
Alors cette chose va détruire
la ville?
Mais enfin, c'est quoi?
Ma théorie était exacte!
La preuve est dans ce documentaire
qui était sur le net.
LA CRISE
DES ORDURES DE 2000
La ville de New York en l'an 2000.
La société qui a le plus gâché
dans l'histoire.
Elle ne trouvait plus de place
pour enterrer ses monceaux d'ordures.
Les décharges étaient pleines,
Le New Jersey était plein.
Alors profitant de la nuit,
la ville mit ses détritus à la mer...
sur la plus grande barge du monde.
L'ECLATE AU SOLEIL
Le répugnant esquif parcourut
les océans 50 ans.
Aucun pays n 'en voulait,
pas même ce pays vraiment immonde.
Vous voyez duquel je parle.
Et en 2052, la ville obtint une fusée
grâce à ses relations dans la pègre...
afin d'envoyer les ordures
dans l'espace.
D'après des experts,
la boule pouvait revenir.
Mais ils furent traités de
"pessimistes".
Ca vient du net? A mon époque, le net
ne servait qu'à voir des trucs pornos.
C'est toujours le cas de nos jours.
Maintenant que les ordures
sont parties...
pourriez-vous vous occuper
de mes inhibitions sexuelles?
Avec joie.
Voilà, à cause de l'inconséquence
de l'ancienne New York...
New New York va être détruite
par une boule d'ordures.
Fry, qu'aviez-vous dans la tête
à ton époque?
- Comment pouviez vous jeter?
- Lâche-moi, tu veux?
- Comment faites-vous?
- On recycle.
- Les cannettes deviennent des robots.
- Et celle-ci était un robot avant.
Et ton sandwich est fait
de sandwichs périmés.
- On ne jette rien qui peut resservir.
- Le futur, c'est dégoûtant.
Typiquement XXème, comme attitude.
Je te trouve gonflée
de critiquer mon siècle.
On a inventé le télégraphe
et les vestes en jean.
- Ce sont des inventions du XIXème.
- C'est parce qu'ils nous ont copiés.
Arrêtons ces vaines discussions.
Le temps nous est compté.
Prévenons le maire!
MAIRIE
Une boule d'ordures?
Inquiétant.
Plus qu'inquiétant,
M. Poopenmeyer.
Je ne veux pas d'erreur de calcul
comme pour la couche d'ozone.
Je veux mon conseiller scientifique.
- Wernstrom!
- Tiens, tiens, tiens.
On vient présenter un napperon?
Non, je suis là car une gigantesque
boule d'ordures se dirige sur nous.
Sentez vous-même.
Rien ne prouve son origine...
il y a peut-être un rat mort
sur les capteurs.
On vient de capter ceci de Neptune!
Gigantesque boule d'ordures...
Elle va nous frôler.
Quelle atroce puanteur!
La transmission s'arrête là.
Non, ce n'est pas fini, je crois.
- Là, c'est tout.
- Mon Dieu!
Ce vieux gâteux disait vrai!
- Lui ou moi?
- Lui!
CHEZ PETE - TELES
On y regarde les infos
depuis 1951
New New York est en état d'alerte,
Morbo?
Merci, femelle humaine.
Panique à New New York à l'annonce
de sa destruction...
imminente par une boule d'ordures.
- Ça me plaît de vivre à Los Angeles.
- Morbo est d'accord.
- Pourquoi pas un missile?
- La simulation du super-ordinateur...
montre que la boule est si gluante
qu'un missile la traverserait.
Et si on envoyait une équipe placer
un explosif au point de rupture...
entre cette montagne de café moulu
et cette pile de CD roms...
En théorie, ça peut marcher.
Vous ne trouverez pas de volontaire
pour une mission si dangereuse.
Eh ben voyons.
Vous aurez très peu de temps
pour la détruire.
Après, elle sera si proche
que l'explosion...
provoquerait une pluie d'ordures
sur la planète...
- tuant par millions.
- C'est triste!
Voici la bombe que j'ai préparée.
Une fois activée, vous aurez 25 mn
pour vous enfuir.
- Seulement, mais...
- Non, non.
J'écouterai vos objections à
votre retour, si vous revenez.
Odeur, magnitude 8.
Magnitude 13.
Magnitude 31!
On va se disloquer!
Active le système anti-odeur!
Fleuri.
- Ouah!
- Regarde tous ces immondices!
Des immondices!
C'est un monument à la gloire
des merveilles du XXème.
Un vrai Billy le tigre!
Une assiette de collection Spock!
Des Bart Simpson!
- Bouffe mon short, mec.
- Entendu!
C'est bon les shorts!
Ces ordures n'ont aucun intérêt.
Plaçons la bombe et partons.
Avec ces trésors!
Je peux fouiller au hasard...
et trouver des trucs super.
D'accord, on fait tout sauter.
Bon alors...
si c'est bien la plaine des seringues,
la bombe doit exploser juste ici.
Soyez prêts, on n'a que 25 mn.
Enfin, "quinze" minutes.
"Cinq" minutes, six "h" minutes?
On a un problème. Le professeur
a monté le compteur à l'envers.
Quel crétin, ça ne nous laisse pas
25 mn, mais juste 52 secondes!
- On va mourir! C'est bien ca?
- C'est ca.
Elle va exploser!
Tu aurais pu éborgner quelqu'un!
Vous n'êtes que des trouillards,
je prends les choses en main.
- On est sauvés.
- Mais la boule ne va plus s'arrêter.
Les New New Yorkais vont mourir.
BIENVENUE A LA MAISON, LOSERS!
En résumé, c'est une journée dont
Mittens le chat, se souviendra.
Morbo digère mal les chats.
Sans transition,
New New York est condamnée.
La faute en revient au célèbre
Pr Farnsworth...
et à son cerveau inférieur d'humain.
Comment ai-je pu monter le
compteur à l'envers?
J'ai suivi le manuel à la lettre.
Je ne mérite plus le titre de
scientifique. Tout est de ma faute.
Non, c'est ma faute avant tout.
Je suis sûr d'avoir jeté
plus que mon quota.
Quand mes toilettes étaient bouchées,
je faisais dans les poubelles.
Tu as raison Leela. Ceux qui vivaient
au XXème étaient débiles.
- Surtout moi.
- Vous avez échoué lamentablement.
Je vais faire appel
à un vrai scientifique.
- Wernstrom!
- En personne.
- Pouvez-vous sauver ma ville?
- Oui. A certaines conditions.
- Un contrat béton.
- D'accord.
- Un gros budget.
- Accordé.
Je veux un labo et cinq assistants
dont au moins trois chinois.
D'accord. Quel est votre plan?
Quel plan?
J'ai ce que je voulais.
Au revoir, pauvre gland.
- Faites quelque chose!
- Son contrat est béton.
Il faut passer à l'action.
Que la femme de ménage
ne vienne que demain.
Je n'ai plus aucune idée.
Et vous?
Attendez!
Si on fabriquait un objet de la même
taille et densité que la boule...
il pourrait la dévier
sans la faire exploser en morceaux.
Mais où trouver une substance
identique aux ordures?
Hélas, je l'ignore.
Si on prenait des ordures?
Seigneur Dieu, une deuxième boule
d'ordures, ça devrait fonctionner!
Vous ne risquez pas
d'en trouver dans les rues.
On n'en produit plus depuis 500 ans!
- Il faut s'y remettre.
- Produire des ordures?
- Mais comment?
- Laissez passer, observez le maître.
Vous voyez la boîte, là?
C'est un déchet. Et ces papiers?
On jette. Cette photo de votre femme?
Aux ordures. Essayez, vous aussi.
On tient peut-être la solution!
On s'y met. Le sort
de la ville est en jeu.
Bien.
Jette ton gâteau. Bender, bois
ta bière et jette la bouteille.
Parfait.
Apportez-lui d'autres bières!
Ce n'est qu'un début. Sans l'aide
de la ville nous n'y arriverons pas.
Citoyens de New New York,
écoutez cette leçon du XXème siècle.
Arrêtez la galère du recyclage
et jetez vos ordures à même le sol.
Jetez-les n 'importe où, comme moi.
Votre ville compte sur vous.
DES ORDURES
POUR LA VILLE!
Si mes calculs sont corrects,
notre boule va envoyer l'autre...
en plein dans le soleil!
Et si mes calculs sont exacts,
nous serons bientôt tous morts!
Ca suffit.
Préparez-vous au lancement!
Cinq, quatre, trois, deux...
trois, quatre, cinq, six...
Vas-y, il en a pour trois heures.
- Ca sent les ordures brûlées!
- Ca a marché!
Et au nom de la ville tout entière,
je vous remercie, Pr Farnsworth.
Je vous remets le prix de l'Académie
que nous avons retiré...
au Dr Wernstrom après avoir compris
que c'était un crétin.
Je suis le meilleur,
Wernstrom!
Je vous aurai Farnsworth,
même si ça doit me prendre 100 ans.
Envers vous aussi,
notre dette est éternelle.
Sans l'art du XXème
de produire des ordures...
nous serions enterrés
sous des ordures du XXème.
Oui mais il y a un risque.
Il se peut que la deuxième boule
retombe sur terre.
On s'en fiche. Ca arrivera
dans des siècles.
Tout à fait exact.
Ca ne nous concerne pas.
Ca c'est l'esprit
du XXème siècle!

L'ENFER C'EST LES AUTRES ROBOTS
BEASTIE BOYS
EN CONCERT
C'est trop géant!
J'ai dû attendre 1000 ans
pour les voir.
- Je t'offre une bière?
- Volontiers!
Mesdames et messieurs,
ils viennent chanter leurs vieux...
leurs très vieux succès...
les Beastie Boys!
Etonnant. Les paroles ne veulent rien
dire, mais ils ont 80% de succès.
Donc c'est un public de malades,
d'un point de vue technique.
Fermez-la, j'aimerais bien écouter.
Comment ca va?
Le spectacle vous plaît?
Achetez des T-shirt!
Ca se bouscule pour danser
devant la scène!
Ce soir, on va faire la fête
comme en 1999.
Génial.
Faites attention!
Ils assurent encore plus qu'avant!
Salut à tous!
- Salut, Bender!
- Salut, Fender!
Ca fait des siècles
qu'on ne s'est pas vus!
- Tu bosses au Jack in the Box?
- Non...
je suis avec le groupe.
Oh, ouais.
Les mecs, je vous présente
mes potes: Bender, Fry et Leela.
Après un concert,
on ne veut voir personne.
J'adore votre musique!
Au 20ème siècle, j'avais vos cinq CD.
C'était il y a 1000 ans.
Maintenant, on en a sept.
Je peux emprunter les nouveaux
et des cassettes vierges?
Plantons là les organiques
et allons à une vraie fête!
Je suis toujours partant
pour prendre une cuite.
C'est quoi cette fête?
Il n'y a rien à boire
et qu'une seule pute.
Arrête de râler,
on va prendre du jack.
Oh... oui!
- T'en veux?
- J'ai rien contre...
mais selon ma notice,
c'est contre-indiqué.
"Contre-indiqué".
Allez, un petit.
Je leur ai dit que t'étais cool.
S'il suffit de prendre du jack
pour avoir l'air cool...
alors je vais le faire!
Doucement mon pote,
on devient vite accro.
T'inquiète pas, je suis pas du genre
à être accro.
On va faire quoi
dans ce quartier pourri?
Me prends pas la tête!
J'en ai pour une minute.
Oh, unité pécheresse, le chemin
pour le paradis des robots...
passe par la disquette 3.0.
Je viens te gonfler quand t'es
déchiré dans le caniveau?
- Non!
- Alors barre-toi!
Qui c'était?
Ta grand-mère. Ferme-la
et emmène-moi au boulot!
Notre facture d'électricité a grimpé
de facon hallucinante.
Quelqu'un gaspille une quantité
énorme de courant.
- C'est sûrement vous!
- Moi?
- Comment tu vas, Bender?
- C'est pas tes onions!
- Il a un problème?
- Il se drogue à l'électricité.
Bender? Tu veux rire.
Je l'aurais remarqué.
Pourquoi passes-tu autant
de temps là-dedans?
- Tu y vas pour prendre du jack?
- N'entre pas!
Bonne nouvelle! Il faut livrer
des citations à comparaître...
sur Sicily 8, la planète mafieuse.
Super! Allez, au boulot!
Je reviens tout de suite.
Vinny a dit qu'il lui donnait
le baiser de la mort...
- mais je pense qu'il est gay.
- Il s'est servi de sa langue?
Un peu.
- Ca va pas?
- C'est pas tes onions!
Il y a des perturbations électriques.
- Quel genre de perturbations?
- Electriques.
Il faut que je change de cap
pour l'éviter.
On fonce droit
vers le champ électrique!
C'est quoi? Je me sens bizarre!
Allez, Univers!
Gros trouillard pratiquement vide!
Fais voir s'il te reste du jus!
Oh, maman.
Ben, quoi?
On se fiche que tu sois alcoolique
ou cleptomane...
- ou que tu lises des revues porno.
- On vous aime pour ça.
Mais pas que tu te drogues.
Tu as failli nous faire tuer!
Tu as trahi ma confiance.
Comme mon pote qui me jurait
qu'il ne se drogait pas...
et un jour, il a piqué
le magnétoscope de ma mère...
pour s'acheter de la drogue.
J'ai honte d'être ton copain.
Tu as raison, il n'y a rien
de bon à tirer de moi.
Il y a peut-être un moyen.
Oh, oui! C'est de la bonne.
Qu'est-ce que je suis devenu?
Je vois beaucoup
de robots sophistiqués...
bien lustrés. Mais ca n'influencera
pas le Diable Robot!
- Non!
- Car si vous avez péché...
rien ne l'empêchera de brancher
son modem infernal...
crachant flammes et fumée!
Et il vous téléchargera
directement en enfer!
- Droit en enfer!
- Qui se lèvera pour être sauvé?
Qui? Qui?
Moi.
Par souci d'économie, j'ai supprimé
le distributeur d'eau salée.
C'est une chasse aux sorcières!
Oh, il fait un merveilleux soleil
Ah, quelle belle journée
Bonjour!
Comme vous êtes beaux, ce matin!
Il s'est envoyé sa dose d'électricité.
Non, fini tout ça, je rêvais.
J'ai découvert la religion.
C'est encore une arnaque
pour nous embrouiller?
Fiche-lui la paix.
Si ça peut l'aider,
on devrait tous le soutenir.
- Ouais.
- Oh, oui.
Génial! Alors je vous invite
tous à venir...
à mon baptême
dans un lieu non climatisé!
Nous sommes réunis
pour délivrer Bender...
des griffes froides
et acérées du diable...
et le faire tomber entre celles
de notre congrégation.
- Bien dit!
- Parole égale vérité.
Frère Bender, acceptes-tu les
préceptes de la Robotologie...
pour éviter la damnation éternelle?
- Je les accepte.
- Alors je vais te baptiser.
Presse une touche pour continuer.
HUILE BAPTISMALE
HAUTE VISCOSITE
Vous pourriez aussi
me ressouder ce truc-là?
L'ancien Bender ne nous aurait
jamais invités à dîner.
Il est parti.
Il ne vous ennuiera plus jamais.
Si monsieur désire consulter
la carte des vins?
Pas de poison, merci. Je me
contenterai d'une huile minérale.
Ca fait digérer.
J'ai une faim de loup.
Mes amis! Mes amis!
On ne peut pas commencer
sans avoir dit les grâces.
Au nom de la logique,
nous rendons grâce...
pour l'énergie
que nous allons absorber.
Selon le prophète Jerimatic:
"Un-zéro-zéro-zéro-un-zéro-un-
zéro-un-zéro-un-zéro-un.
Zéro-zéro-un.
Zéro-un-un-zéro-zéro-un.
Deux."
Amen.
- Ca veut dire qu'on peut manger?
- Oui.
Mais avant,
je vous aime tellement...
j'aimerais faire un câlin à chacun.
- Dans mes bras, Fry!
- J'ai pas envie.
Fry, tu es mon ami.
Tous en ligne pour un câlin!
Que je vous montre l'amour
que j'ai pour vous.
- Que fais-tu au vaisseau?
- Je le sanctifie.
Ca va convertir ceux
qui nous suivent de trop près.
- Il me rend dingue avec sa religion.
- Amen.
Il devrait choisir une religion plus
répandue telle que l'Oprahisme.
- Il doit redevenir comme avant.
- Je sais comment.
Il faut le réhabituer à fréquenter
des lieux sordides.
Quelqu'un a affrété un vaisseau
pour délivrer un colis...
à Atlantic City?
Au fait, on livre quoi?
Ca.
On doit le livrer où?
Ici.
Et voilà, mission accomplie.
Retournons au bureau pour une soirée
de jeûne et de repentir.
Attends! Tu veux pas aller voir
un spectacle de danse exotique?
Super idée!
Ces créatures n'ont pas
de carrosserie!
- On peut voir leurs circuits!
- On va se marrer...
et se boire de bonnes
bouteilles de vin.
Quoi? Boire du vin est un péché.
Même s'il est excellent.
Regarde ce sac, la courroie est
si fine qu'elle pourrait casser.
- Tu ne voleras point!
- C'est une pute 5000.
Elle a un cœur en or.
- Salut, beau ténébreux.
- Ne me tente pas!
J'ai enfin la paix intérieure!
C'est pour les losers!
Pèche tant que tu veux!
- Lâche-toi!
- Vis!
Vous pouvez garder mon sac?
Vas-y, tu en crèves d'envie.
Ben...
Je suis le plus grand!
- L'ancien Bender est revenu.
- Tu l'as dit, mon pote!
A un détail près.
Vu que je suis
un grand réalisateur...
je ferai passer des auditions
ce soir.
Bien que vous soyez
toutes jeunes et naïves...
je crois que vous avez
tout ce qu'il faut.
C'est pas le moment! Vous avez pas
vu la pancarte "Ne pas déranger"?
Non! Non!
Salutations, Bender!
Bienvenue dans l'Enfer des Robots!
- Qu'est-il arrivé?
- Il n'a pas payé sa note.
Le cendrier est là.
Nibbler a flairé la vodka et l'huile!
Bien, conduis-nous à Bender!
C'est un cauchemar, c'est ça?
Non, l'Enfer Robotique est bien réel.
Voici notre brochure.
J'ai rien à faire ici.
Je déteste ce qui fait mal ou peur.
Mais tu étais d'accord
quand tu as rejoint notre religion.
Si tu pèches, tu vas en enfer...
pour toute l'éternité!
Nom de Dieu... Zut!
Tu as le droit de jurer.
Je me rappelle cet endroit.
Ils ont fermé quand des gens
ont chopé des salmonelles.
C'était le symbole de la religion
de Bender!
C'est incroyable!
On a trouvé l'entrée
de l'Enfer Robotique!
Qui aurait pu croire qu'il existait...
dans le New Jersey!
En fait...
On connaît tes péchés...
et pour chacun, on t'a préparé
un cruel et amusant châtiment.
Messieurs?
Oh, il va chanter.
Ca vous gêne si je fume?
Tu aimes les cigares,
Ça tombe bien
On allait s 'en rouler un
Ça te fait quoi d'être transformé
En panatella?

FRITURE
Friture de robot!
- Mais pourquoi moi
- Tes crimes, les voilà
- Il y a des robots pires que moi
- Non, il n 'y en a pas
J'ai pas été sage, mais ce n 'était
Que des enfantillages
- Plusieurs vols à l'étalage
- Je suis programmé
Cesse de mentir, laisse-moi chanter
Pirater des disques c'est mal
Payer des droits d'auteur c'est bien
Mets ton disque dur
Viens te faire scratcher

- J'ai mal au cœur
- Le sauver est un point d'honneur
- Il est bien en enfer
- On l'a tenté, j'en suis pas fière
- Il est peut-être à l'hôtel
- Allons, n 'aie pas peur
Plus qu'une demi-heure
- Laisse-toi donc glisser
- J'ai mal aux fesses de glisser
Vols de diamants, combats de coqs
Publication de journaux indécents

Tu es là pour en baver

Ce n'était que les hors-d'œuvre.
- Bender, ça va?
- Non.
Ils m'ont torturé avec des chansons
et des danses.
D'accord, Beelzebot.
Que veux-tu en échange?
J'ai tous les atouts en main,
vous n'y pouvez rien.
Signez cette renonciation
au concours de violon.
Quel concours de violon?
Le code de Justice Infernale
numéro 2275...
m'oblige à vous informer
que si vous me battez au violon...
vous gagnerez l'âme de Bender.
- Et un violon en or.
- Ca doit peser trois tonnes...
- et avoir un son naze?
- C'est pour la frime.
- Tu sais en jouer?
- Non. Et toi?
Non, mais j'ai fait des percussions.
- Et si on perd?
- Vous gagnez un violon en argent.
Et je devrai tuer l'un d'entre vous.
Lui.
- On accepte.
- Bien, alors...
Ecoutez ca!
On est foutus.
A vous.
Maintenant, solo de percussions.
Courez!
Arrêtez-les, ils ont triché!
- Vite!
- Je pourrais...
si tu jetais cette saleté de violon.
Désolée.
- Ouais!
- Super!
Plus jamais je ne serai trop bon
ou trop mauvais.
Désormais, je serai moi-même.
Tu pourrais être un peu
moins mauvais?
J'en sais rien. Tu survivrais
à une chute de 200 m?
Ce bon vieux Bender!
Je dédie cette chanson
A mon pote Bender
C'est une dédicace à ma façon
A tous les robots de cet univers
Avec nous, le Professeur

Donnez-moi une autre chance!
La maison n'autorise que trois
chances, lanceur suivant!
Un grand verre,

Pas de problŤme!
Permettez-moi de me prťsenter,
je m'appelle Bender.
Enchantťe!
Je suis la Comtesse de la Roca.
Quelle surprise de voir un robot en
1Ťre classe! La plupart travaille.
Je peux vous assurer que le sens
mÍme du mot travail m'ťchappe!
- Oh, M. Bender!
- Voyons, appelez-moi Bender!
Eh bien, je ne sais pas si...
- Quelque chose me dťmange!
- Vous voulez votre poudre!
L'aventure me dťmange!
Changeons de route!
C'est une croisiŤre d'agrťment.
Suivons celle de l'armateur!
Pourquoi? La mienne est beaucoup
plus audacieuce!
Mais il faut traverser
un essaim de comŤtes!
Oui, des comŤtes...
ces icebergs cosmiques!
En rebondissant dessus,

- Amy, Coucou!
- Maman, papa! Que fichez-vous ici?
On avait prťvu le farniente, mais on
va plutŰt se mÍler de ta vie privťe!
- On a rencontrť un gentil garÁon.
- Il n'est pas si laid.
Tu peux l'ťpouser ou en faire
ton gťniteur pour un petit-fils!
Regarde, il est lŗ, au buffet!
Il est sŻrement gentil,
mais, j'ai dťjŗ un petit copain!
Montre-le-nous!
Il devrait Ítre lŗ ŗ faire ce qu'il
faut pour qu'on ait un petit-fils!
Notre cabine est une horreur,
mais quelle vue magnifique, ici!
C'est romantique... enfin,
platonique. Platonique comme vue!
Ne t'inquiŤte pas, Fry!
Je pense que cette histoire de faux
fiancť n'ťtait qu'un terrible...
Le moment est peut-Ítre inopportun...
mais si ce type devait te quitter...
je serai lŗ pour te consoler!
Avant que tu n'ailles imaginer
je ne sais quoi, c'ťtait pour Zapp!
- T'aurais rien d'autre pour lui?
- Evite de compliquer les choses!
Maman, papa: Je vous prťsente
Fry, mon petit copain!
A plus tard, mon amour!
J'aurais aimť savoir
que tu sortais avec Amy!
Mais non, c'est juste
pour ses parents!
- Tu n'es pas jalouse, j'espŤre?
- Moi? Non, bien sŻr que non!
Je considŤre ma fausse
relation avec toi plus importante!
Je vous ennuie si je vais
me rafraÓchir?
Mais, absolument pas!
Prenez votre temps!
Bingo!
Ravissant, n'est-ce pas?
Oui, mais seulement 93 pour cent
aussi ravissant que vous!
Ou c'est une erreur de calcul ou vous
Ítes le robot le plus romantique!
Je n'y comprends rien!
Le diamant est aussi gros qu'un
cerveau de raton laveur!
- Pourquoi n'ai-je pas pu le voler?
- Vous Ítes amoureux!
Vous avez raison.
Mais, tout nous sťpare!
C'est une comtesse, avec une cuillŤre
en argent dans la bouche...
et moi, je suis un type,
tout ŗ fait ordinaire!
- N'oubliez pas de les payer!
- SŻrement pas!
La sťcuritť est demandťe au bar!
Les mecs, je vous en prie!
Je suis amoureux!
Cognez-le!
Que faites-vous?
Ce fauchť voulait me voler
deux cocktails!
Je vois. Tenez, monsieur!
Gardez la monnaie.
A votre service!
- Allez, professeur!
- Cambrez-vous!
Tu es meilleur au limbo
que tous ces gens!
Ne sois pas cruelle! Je peux pas.
Pas aprŤs ce qui s'est passť!
JEUX OLYMPIQUES 2980
Pour l'ťquipe de la Terre, au limbo,
voici HermŤs Conrad.
Tu es mon hťros, HermŤs!
Je veux Ítre comme toi, plus tard!
Non, petit! C'est trop bas!
Tu vas te bousiller la colonne!
Je fais comme HermŤs!
Je fais comme...
Tu n'iras plus faire de limbo,
si tu ne veux pas.
Ce n'est pas pour autant
que tu n'es plus un homme!
- Je me suis trouvť une meuf!
- J'adore les hommes souples!
Votre attention!
C'est ŗ moi...
que revient la charge de dťsigner le
vainqueur de limbo, ŗ moi seul!
Vous devriez surveiller
les comŤtes!
Et le vainqueur est...
Leela!
Je n'ai rien fait!
Je connais personnellement
tes qualitťs au plan horizontal!
Comme rťcompense, toi
et ton chimpanzť...
Ítes invitťs ŗ dÓner, ce soir,
ŗ la table du capitaine!
Voilŗ, vous savez tout.
Je ne suis pas vraiment riche.
Je suis un imposteur!
Pauvre, fainťant, sexy et menteur!
Ce n'est mÍme pas un vrai núud
papillon, c'est magnťtique!
L'argent m'importe peu!
J'aime votre pensťe artificielle
et votre simulateur de sincťritť!
Ah bon, vraiment?
BUFFET A VOLONTE
PLUS UN POULET ENTIER
J'aime votre style.
On dirait moi, jeune!
Pas beaucoup plus jeune:
Moi, il y a deux ou trois ans!
- Merci.
- En gentleman, je vous prťviens:
Ne vous avisez pas d'en
regarder une autre...
ou je fondrai sur Leela tel
l'abeille sur une fleur!
- Leela, c'est la seule qui compte!
- Salut, Fry!
- Amy!
- Leela!
La famille Wong!
Nous sommes au complet!
C'est la tuile! Fry ne peut pas dire
qu'il a deux petites amies!
Je sais comment gťrer ce genre
de situations...
j'ai vu Amour, gloire et beautť.
Portons un toast!
Au couple charmant et ŗ leur bonheur!
- Maintenant, embrassez-la!
- Embrassez votre bien-aimťe!
Une minute!
Amour, gloire et beautť...
Des mots qui font rÍver...
- Alors? Embrassez-la!
- Je comprends plus rien!
Dis-moi, avec laquelle de ces deux
jeunes femmes es-tu?
- Puis-je vous dire un mot?
- Non!
- La situation est grave!
- Revenez quand Áa sera dťsastreux!
Il ne manquait plus que Áa!
Comme Zapp est parti et que mes
parents sont lŗ...
Je suis sŻre que Fry va m'embrasser
sans hťsiter davantage!
On voit que tu me connais bien,
tu as devinť!
- Vous souvenez-vous de la route?
- Non.
Il s'avŤre plus suicidaire
que je ne le redoutais!
Qu'est-ce qui dťgoŻte le plus:
Votre couardise ou votre stupiditť?
Au lieu de nous
diriger par-lŗ...
nous allons foncer droit
vers ce trou noir...
- Pourquoi tu t'es enfuie?
- Je ne me suis pas enfuie.
J'ai pu finir mon dessert
pendant que tu l'embrassais!
Elle ne m'intťresse pas,
c'est toi que je prťfŤre!
Tu en es sŻr? Je veux dire, elle a
deux yeux et tu as deux yeux aussi!
On ferait un couple parfait,
mais je ne ressens rien pour elle!
Quelle belle nťbuleuse!
On dirait que tout le monde
s'est trouvť quelqu'un, sauf moi!
Et moi!
Qu'est-ce que c'ťtait?
Mon dieu!
On se dirige vers un trou noir!
Comment ca tue l'ambiance!
Ne vous reprochez rien!
On ťtait vouťs ŗ l'ťchec.
Le capitaine n'a plus qu'ŗ sombrer
avec son navire!
- Cette attitude vous honore!
- Non, c'est vous qu'elle honore!
Car maintenant,
vous commandez!
Mes fťlicitations, capitaine!
On doit traverser le vaisseau pour
atteindre les navettes de secours.
- Je suis trop jeune pour mourir!
- Vite, avant que ce soit trop tard!
Allez-y! Je vais jeter
un coup d'úil par lŗ...
pour voir s'il y a rien ŗ voler!
- Tu vas pas sauver la comtesse?
- J'y vais!
Je voulais leur cacher!
Si je reviens pas, dis que je
suis mort en volant un vieux!
Je dirai que tu lui as arrachť le
doigt pour taxer sa bague!
Toi, t'es un vrai copain!
Comtesse, comtesse!
- J'ai traversť le plancher!
- Es-tu blessťe, mon amour?
- Non, des gens ont amorti ma chute!
- Ne t'inquiŤte pas!
Je vais ťteindre ce feu!
Tu as risquť ta vie pour me sauver!
Et je le referai encore une fois,
et mÍme une autre fois!
Mais aprŤs, j'arrÍterai!
Quand on s'embrasse, j'ai
l'impression d'Ítre plongť dans...
une piscine d'eau glacťe,
qui se remplit!
Vite! Les navettes de secours
ne sont plus loin!
Plus vite!
SAS DE SECOURS
C'est bloquť! La commande
d'ouverture est de l'autre cŰtť!
Personne ne pourra passer
lŗ-dessous!
Personne, sauf un lťgendaire
champion de limbo!
Oh, HermŤs!
Je suis un peu enrouillť!
Je le fais pour l'enfant qui est
au paradis par amour du limbo!
Super, chťri!
Tu restes le champion!
Je tiens encore la forme!
Descendez la porte d'un centimŤtre!
- Trouve plutŰt la commande, abruti!
- Oui, chťrie!
- Il a rťussi!
- Bravo, HermŤs!
Quelqu'un pourrait m'aider?
- Maintenant, que fait-on?
- Attends une minute!
- Tu fais partie du yacht club?
- Mais oui, tu as raison!
Je suis ťquipťe d'une hťlice!
Gr‚ce ŗ Dieu, il y assez de navettes!
Plus besoin de nous dťguiser
en femme ou en enfant!
On attend Bender. Il faut
lui laisser une chance.
L'hyper gravitť doit ralentir
son pillage!
- Vous vous en Ítes sortis?
- Oui, mais quelle importance!
- Ce qui importe, c'est ton fiancť!
- Un capitaine!
Maman, je ne veux...
- Salut!
- Bonsoir!
Je me sens trŤs mal!
Regarde!
C'est notre nťbuleuse!
Chaque fois que je la verrai, je
penserai au moment oý on a presque...
C'est pas grave!
Tous les autres ont quittť
le vaisseau. Oý est Bender?
Je n'en sais rien, mais nous
ne pouvons plus l'attendre!
Au revoir, Bender!
Attendez!
Quelque chose cloche! On a plus
de deux tonnes de surcharge!
- J'y suis pour rien!
- Regardez!
Je glisse!
La pression est trop forte!
Je ne pourrai pas vivre sans toi!
Si jamais tu l‚ches,
je l‚che aussi!
Non, il te reste de belles
choses ŗ vivre!
Tu souffriras puis un jour,
tu pourras partager ton amour!
C'est logique,
c'est mathťmatique!
Ne parle pas comme Áa.
Les amours tragiques finissent bien!
Adieu!
Partie... elle est partie!
En se sacrifiant, elle nous a sauvťs.
On a pu ťchapper du trou noir!
Pleure pas! On sait pas
ce qui se passe dans les trous noirs!
C'est possible qu'elle soit encore
en vie dans une autre dimension!
Oui, absolument!
Aucune chance!
Au moins, il me restera
toujours son bracelet!
A votre avis,
combien il peut valoir?
Rien, c'est du toc!

On a une livraison très particulière
à faire aujourd'hui.
- A qui livre-t-on?
- A moi.
Encore une mission bien remplie.
Non, cette caisse doit être livrée à
mon bureau de l'université martienne.
Cette expérimentation
pourrait me valoir le Prix Nobel.
- Lequel?
- Qu'importe, le gain est le même.
- C'est dangereux?
- Bien sûr que non!
Eh ben, alors, allons-y!
Diffusé en martien sur le câble
L'université martienne
UNIVERSITE MARTIENNE
LA CONNAISSANCE ENGENDRE LA PEUR
A la fin du 20ème siècle...
on ne se doutait pas
qu'il y avait une fac sur Mars.
En ce temps-là, Mars n'était
qu'un désert aride et inhospitalier.
Un peu comme l'Utah. Contrairement à
l'Utah, on a pu le rendre habitable...
quand l'université fut fondée en 2636.
On retrouve la végétation des campus
terriens: Arbres, herbe.
C'est ce qui a terraformé la planète.
- On peut respirer sans risque?
- Mais bien sûr!
Nous voici
devant la bibliothèque Wong...
qui possède la plus grande collection
de littérature à l'ouest de l'univers.
FICTION Disque l
REALITE Disque Il
C'est la salle de mon ancien club
d'étudiants robots:
Epsilon Rho Rho.
Toi, tu es allé à la fac?
Bien sûr. Je suis un tordeur.
J'ai fait une licence de tordage.
- T'avais pris quoi comme UV?
- Tricot et couture.
C'est le service de dératisation?
Non. Je suis un ancien
de la confrérie Epsilon.
- C'est à peu près ça. Tu peux entrer.
- Merci! Je te rends ton doigt.
Seuls les robots les plus cool
appartenaient à cette confrérie.
Mat en 143 coups.
Flûte! C'est encore toi qui gagne!
Hé, les ringards!
Je m'appelle Gearshift,
président du club.
Lui, c'est Oily et celui-là,
c'est Gros Bot.
Vous êtes tous des nazes.
Mon nom est Bender.
Comme le célébrissime Bender?
T'es une légende vivante!
On m'a raconté qu'une nuit
t'avais bu un tonneau de bière...
et enfermé 58 humains
dans une cabine téléphonique.
Oui, mais la plupart étaient des
enfants. Bon, faut que je m'en aille.
Attends! Notre confrérie est nulle.
Même les Mormons font mieux que nous.
Apprends-nous à devenir
aussi cool que toi.
Il me faudra 10 tonneaux de bières,
une cassette de "Louie, Louie"...
et une grande échelle pour aller mater
dans le dortoir des filles.
C'est super, c'est super!
Me retrouver dans cette fac me
rappelle l'époque où j'étais étudiant.
CENTRE UNIVERSITAIRE
DE CONEY ISLAND
Approchez!
Qui veut étudier la physique?
VOUS DEVEZ MESURER
CETTE TAILLE
Gardez bien les mains
à l'intérieur du wagon.
Cette bonne vieille fac de
Coney Island. Allez, les Whitefish!
Sans vouloir te vexer, tu n'as pas
le profile d'un ancien étudiant.
Ah, ouais?
Ca t'en bouche un coin? Je suis
un authentique glandeur diplômé.
Les facs du 20ème siècle étaient
des espèces de garderies hors de prix.
Selon les critères actuels, c'est
comme si tu n'avais pas fait d'études.
Mais c'est pas juste!
Je mérite autant de respect que ceux
qui glandent à la fac en l'an 3000.
Je vais m'inscrire à l'université
martienne et rater encore mes études!
- Tu ne tiendras pas deux semaines.
- C'est sympa de croire en moi.
INSCRIPTIONS DES ETUDIANTS
Salut! Tu t'inscris en quoi?
Vous allez enseigner quoi,
ce semestre?
Comme d'habitude: Les mathématiques
du champ quantique des particules.
Avec un nom pareil,
aucun étudiant n'ose s'inscrire.
Mathématiques du champ aquatique
de libellule. Je m'inscris!
Voyons, je suis professeur.
Je ne sais pas enseigner!
A tout à l'heure!
Je sens qu'on va s'éclater.
- Bingo!
- Oh, la vache!
Qui c'est qui va bientôt
se déshabiller?
Regarde ça!
Vous avez abîmé la masure des
domestiques ainsi qu'eux-mêmes.
Cette fois, vous êtes allés trop loin,
satanés tas de ferraille!
On se casse!
J'ai tout ça pour moi tout seul:
2 chaises, 2 bureaux, 2 lits.
- Un pivert?
- Ca doit être ton copain de chambre.
Ah, ouais. Cool.
Tu peux entrer, mon pote!
- Mais...
- Je prends le lit du dessus!
Mon copain de chambre
est un singe.
Brillante déduction!
Pour un humain, t'es vachement fort.
- Je vois que tu connais Gunther.
- Vous savez comment il s'appelle?
C'est mon expérience. C'est lui qu'on
a transporté dans cette caisse puante.
Je préférerais vivre dans cette caisse
plutôt qu'ici, avec ce crétin.
- Il sait parler?
- Il est trafiqué génétiquement?
Ne tombons pas dans la science-fiction
à la mords-moi le neutron.
Son intelligence réside
dans son chapeau en électronium.
Il a le pouvoir de convertir l'énergie
solaire en radiation cognitive.
Vous gaspillez votre salive.
Il comprend pas un mot.
Le mot "chapeau", je l'ai pigé!
Arrêtez! Vous êtes dans la
même chambre pour une bonne raison.
Pour n'avoir qu'un numéro de téléphone
à retenir. Allez, serrez-vous la main.
Tu veux une banane?
Je préfère les barres énergétiques,
parfum banane, à base de tofu.
Je t'aime pas du tout.
HISTOIRE DU 20EME SIECLE
Je sens que ça va être facile,
pour moi.
Bienvenue en cours d'histoire
du 20ème siècle.
Que je regarde à droite ou à gauche,
dans n'importe quelle direction...
je ne vois que des élèves
qui peineront pour avoir la moyenne.
C'est gonflant. Moi, j'ai envie
d'étudier la vie de Bill Clinton.
Je vous préviens:
Le seul moyen d'avoir un A est d'avoir
vécu soi-même au 20ème siècle.
Super!
Vous disiez, M. Fry?
Moi, j'ai vécu au 20ème siècle.
Posez-moi une question.
Quel appareil inventé
au 20ème siècle...
permet de visionner des programmes
diffusés par ondes hertziennes?
Ca, je le sais.
C'est quoi, déjà? Le formica!
Je suppose que c'était:
"La télévision"?
Excellent, M. Gunther.
T'es mignon et intelligent, toi.
BATIMENT MENTHOLYPTUS
Ce que j'aime
dans ce poste de doyen...
c'est la paix, la tranquillité
et le respect que j'en retire.
Qu'y a-t-il, encore?
Les étudiants du club des robots
sont là.
Le club des robots.
- Salut, il est chouette votre bateau.
- Ne vous en approchez pas!
Vous, les robots, êtes la honte
de cette université.
Quand il y a une fausse
alerte d'incendie, c'est vous.
Quand le bar du campus est pillé,
c'est vous.
- Quand un humain se fait racketter...
- Ca, je peux l'expliquer.
J'en ai assez de vous!
A la moindre incartade, les robots
seront exclus de cette université.
- C'est pas juste!
- Ma mère va me tuer!
Maintenant, je dois m'occuper
de la seule chose...
qui m'ait empêché de devenir dingue:
Mon modèle réduit.
Gros Bot! Non!
Quand je suis stressé,
ca me donne faim.
On se casse!
Maudits robots!
On s'entend bien. Enfin, je trouve.
Ca te branche d'aller à une fête
avec moi?
Pas même si tu étais
le dernier mec sur Mars.
Hé! Le mangeur de bananes!
J'ai son numéro! Qu'est-ce que
tu dis de ça, pauvre cake?
Si l'on en croit le résultat
de cette équation...
les électrons devraient avoir
un goût de framboise.
- Désolé, je me suis pas réveillé.
- Il est 17h20!
C'est ce singe qui m'a empêché de
dormir en réfléchissant à haute voix.
Il fait tout pour que je passe
pour un crétin.
Ne sois pas jaloux.
Sans son chapeau, il ne serait
guère plus intelligent que toi.
- Je déteste ce rongeur!
- C'est ma plus importante découverte.
Si vous continuez à vous bagarrer,
je vous ferai castrer tous les deux.
Ca lui fera les pieds.
RECEPTION DES PARENTS
Je vous présente mes parents,
Leo et Ines.
Je suis ravi que nous ayons pu
accepter votre fille...
pour vous remercier
de votre générosité.
- Combien, pour le club Beta Kappa?
- Ca va être très cher.
J'ai pas vu l'heure. J'étais en train
de réviser avec Chrissy.
Content que tu aies pu venir.
Comme les parents sont à l'honneur...
j'ai une petite surprise pour toi.
Maman! Papa!
Qu'est-ce que vous fichez ici?
C'est trop humiliant!
Des singes comme ceux-là, je les aime.
Comment? Vous voulez sortir?
Non! Stop!
Sapristi!
- Quels curieux projectiles!
- Ils en jettent sur le doyen!
Pourquoi tu grimpes pas sur le lustre
avec eux, que je fasse une photo?
La fête commence à retomber.
On va faire une virée à Tijuana. Il
faut que Gros Bot se fasse déniaiser.
Ma première fois.
Ca me stresse un max.
Mon portrait, sagouin!
Tu as été cruel. Au risque de me faire
traiter de donneuse de lecons...
cette histoire nous a montré
lequel était le plus bête.
J'ai pas voulu être méchant.
Attention! Il a un flingue!
Laissez-moi tranquille.
Je croyais que tu détestais
les bananes.
Bien sûr que non.
J'ai tout fait pour m'intégrer...
mais de voir mes parents,
ce soir...
ca m'a fait réaliser
que je ne suis qu'un animal primitif.
On n'est pas forcés de devenir
comme ses parents.
Regarde-moi. Mes parents étaient
honnêtes et travailleurs.
En plus, tu es différent
des autres singes. Tu as un chapeau.
Et alors? C'est sûr, j'ai un look
d'enfer et ça me rend intelligent.
Mais c'est pas ça
qui me rendra heureux.
C'est trop triste. Je ne savais pas
que les singes pleuraient.
Les autres, non. Mais moi,
j'ai ça sur la tête.
Si tu n'es pas heureux ici, pourquoi
ne pas retourner dans la jungle?
Dans la jungle?
Le professeur compte sur moi
pour le Prix Nobel.
Il est comme un père pour moi.
C'est le singe qui a plongé
dans le punch, ton père.
EXAMEN D'HISTOIRE
Regardez-le! Je suis tellement fier.
- Merci, professeur.
- Je ne parle pas de toi!
J'ai toujours su
qu'un jour il s'enfuirait.
Mais pourquoi? Pourquoi?
Pourquoi ne lui ai-je pas brisé
les deux jambes?
DORTOIR DES BOURSIERS
Pauvre Gunther.
Il s'est enfui comme ça,
au beau milieu de l'examen?
Absolument, oui.
Il n'a laissé qu'une feuille
gribouillée. Il a dû copier sur Fry.
Il a dû suivre mon conseil.
Il est retourné dans la jungle.
Quoi? Sais-tu depuis combien de
temps je travaille sur son cerveau?
Vous vouliez forcer Gunther à devenir
un humain, mais c'est un animal.
Il doit vivre dans la jungle ou dans
un cirque et faire du tricycle.
J'ai toujours trouvé ça super.
Mais il a plus intérêt à rester
intelligent. Dites-lui, Leela.
Je préfère rester en dehors de ça.
Mais voilà mon opinion.
Ce que nous devrions faire...
- Comment?
- Il faut aller dans la jungle...
et laisser Gunther décider
une fois pour toutes.
Comment?
GRANDE REGATE INTERCLUBS
Le club vainqueur remportera
le titre de "club de l'année".
Même si ses membres étaient à 2 doigts
d'être exclus, toute sanction...
serait levée.
Je serai le tambour major à la parade
que nous ferons en leur honneur.
Vous, là, du club des robots.
Votre radeau est aussi mal concu
que vous l'êtes.
Bien envoyé, Chet!
Ah, oui? Regarde un peu ça!
Où a-t-il été élevé?
Confréries, à vos marques!
Ah!
La jungle sur Mars, ça ressemble
à la jungle sur Terre.
Des jungles, sur Terre?
Quelque chose a bougé!
Je crois que c'est lui.
Attention, ne bougez plus!
- Mon Dieu!
- Ne vous en faites pas.
Ils se réveilleront quand les effets
du gaz seront dissipés.
Cette fois, c'est bien lui.
Professeur, montrez-lui le chapeau.
Fry, propose-lui la banane.
A lui de choisir s'il veut redevenir
intelligent ou rester au stade animal.
- Viens chercher le chapeau.
- Non, la banane! La banane!
Considère les implications
métaphysiques de ton choix.
La banane! La banane!
Qu'est-ce qu'on entend?
- Tu es sûr que c'est un raccourci?
- Pas aussi sûr qu'il y a une heure!
Et le vainqueur est...
le club des robots!
Grâce à Dieu, ce tronc est solide.
Prends le chapeau!
Tu es le seul qui puisse nous sauver!
Stupide macaque.
- Ca ne se met pas là!
- Continue d'essayer!
Le chapeau se met sur la tête!
C'est tellement évident, maintenant!
Au secours, Gunther!
Nom d'un chien! Tenez le coup!
Il faut que je fasse des calculs!
Ca y est!
Accrochez-vous!
- On est sauvés!
- Bien joué, Gunther!
Dépêche-toi! Grimpe le long de la
liane, tu vas arriver à t'en sortir!
Ca servirait à quoi?
Je n'ai plus aucune raison de lutter.
J'étais malheureux
quand j'étais un génie.
Et comme singe, je suis si bête que je
voulais mettre ca sur mes fesses.
Il n'y a pas de place pour moi,
dans ce monde.
Quoique, d'un autre côté, je...
Ce pauvre petit Gunther.
Allons récolter les morceaux. Ce
serait idiot de les laisser se perdre.
- Gunther, tu es vivant!
- Le chapeau a dû amortir ma chute.
Il ne fonctionne qu'à la moitié
de sa capacité. Je vais arranger ça.
Non, je préfère ce réglage!
Je me sens bien, en fait...
je suis heureux!
Mais que fais-tu
de ta super intelligence?
Quand je l'avais, je subissais
trop de pression.
Je veux être un singe d'intelligence
moyenne qui porte des costumes.
J'ai donc décidé de faire
une école de commerce!
Approchez, tout le monde! Venez faire
la fête avec le club des robots!

Non, c'est pour les filles!
Je préfère "Dingo Vidéo"

Laissez-nous!
C'est la fête du travail!
Cette fête inventée qui a été imposée
par ces gangsters de syndicats!
- Oui, c'est ça!
- Génial! Un jour de congé!
On va à la plage,
ça branche quelqu'un?
- Je veux bien!
- Je suis prêt!
Je vais rester, ici.
Tu passes ton temps
vautré devant la télévision!
Il faudrait que tu voies

C'est de la haute définition,
c'est mieux que dans le monde réel!
On est trop poli pour te le dire,
mais tu es couvert d'escarres!
- Pas partout!
- Monte dans la voiture!
Nous y voilà!

Le mont Rushmore, la tour de Pise:
Tout ca se trouve à New York?

je préfère aller nager!
Voilà, c'est prêt!
Venez vous servir!
Comme ceux de mon père!
Il s'est fait viré du restaurant!
Tu commences à m'échauffer les

C'est pas les oreilles!
Je reviens tout de suite!
Oh, oui!

Non! Les frimeurs ne m'intéressent

et assez beaux mecs!
Tu peux y aller!
J'ai du travail!
On s'est pas compris! Je suis frimeur

Je fais semblant de draguer,
vous me frappez, je suis sonné...

Même si c'était ma fiancée,
je refuserai! Je vous la laisse!
Tout compte fait, je ne suis pas
contre l'idée d'aller nous promener!
Non merci, en fait...
je suis gay!
A l'aide!

Sortez-moi de là! Je ne survivrai

D'accord, d'accord!
Je vais vous libérer!

les plus intelligents d'entre nous ont
dû s'accoupler pour se reproduire!
A nouveau, pour gagner
au loto, il fallait jouer le quatre.
Les extraterrestres continuent
à tout détruire sur la planète.
Voici une allocution de M. Mac Neal,
Président de la Terre.
Inutile de résister. Nous allons
capituler sans poser de conditions.
Nous devons nous mettre à genoux.
Donnez à nos nouveaux maîtres ce...
Peuple de la Terre!
Je m'appelle Lure, de la planète
Omicron Persei Huit.
Ça marche, ce truc?
Nous sommes venus
à cause de Mac Neal.
Donnez-le-nous ou nous détruirons
tout avec nos lasers anti-monuments!
Nous exigeons Mac Neal!
L 'humanité préfère
disparaître plutôt...
que céder à leurs exigences,
concernant ce Mac Neal...
Qui que ça puisse être!
N'ai-je pas raison?
Voici l'homme qui va conduire
notre combat pour la liberté...
auréolé de son sanglant triomphe
sur la galaxie Gandhi Ill...
le général 35 étoiles:
Zapp Brannigan!
T'as vu! C'est ce ringard
avec qui t'as couché!
La Terre est attaquée!
On pourrait pas oublier ça?
Sûrement pas!
J'ai déjà tué un tas
d'extraterrestres...
mais je ne peux pas
combattre seul...
je réquisitionne tous les vaisseaux
et leur équipage.
Les autres, trouvez une arme
et tirez dans tous les sens!
Vous avez entendu: On est mobilisés.
Montez dans le vaisseau!
Une seconde!
Non!
Je suis l'objecteur de conscience!
- T'es quoi?
- Tu sais, un lâche!
Etant en guerre...
tous les robots ont un programme
patriotique à activer!
Tout robot doit donner sa vie pour
le bien de l'humanité! La galère!
On est tous de différentes cultures.
Certains sont blancs, d'autres noirs.
Vous êtes marron.
Et vous, argenté!
Mais je me fiche que votre peau
soit rouge, grise ou chinoise!
Vous allez apprendre à mourir
ensemble. Compris, soldats?
C'est-à-dire que je...
A vos ordres, mon général!
Votre mission est simple:
Détruire les extraterrestres!
Pas moi, monsieur!
Oui, bien sûr! Ne détruisez pas
Kif! A moins d'y être forcé!
La délicieuse capitaine Leela!
Le combat devient sexy pour sauver
l'avenir de l'espèce humaine!
Je ne suis pas
techniquement humaine.
Oui, je sais!
Personne ne détruit Leela, non plus!
La clé de la victoire:
La discipline et un lit au carré!
Entraînez-vous jusqu'à
le faire en dormant!
Pendant qu'on dort?
Vous ne pourrez pas dormir,
vu que vous ferez votre lit!
Le vaisseau est ici.
Si nous le touchons dans le mille...
le reste des dominos s'écroulera tel
un château de cartes! Echec et mat!
Ma stratégie est si simple qu'un
idiot aurait pu la concevoir!
A l'heure J, tous les vaisseaux
fileront droit vers...
les canons lasers extraterrestres,
afin de les détruire.
Vous ne trouvez pas plus logique
d'envoyer les robots en éclaireur?
Je suis volontaire pour une mission
suicide! Saleté de programme!
Quand je commande: Toutes les
missions sont des missions suicides!
J'oubliais: Avant
de nous jeter dans la bataille...
veux-tu faire l'amour, au cas où
l'un de nous ne revient pas?
Attendons la fin,
au cas où aucun de nous ne revient!
Garde espoir!
Je serai un héros de science-fiction,
l'égal de lan Solo ou Xena!
C'est pas de la télé, c'est la vie.
Tu ne fais pas la différence?
C'est comme à la télé mais en mieux!
On a des dégâts?
Le moteur auxiliaire est mort,
ils ont renversé mon cocktail!
Très bien, assez plaisanté!
Ca, c'est pour son cocktail!
On a réussi!
On a gagné!
Oui, mais quand je pense à ce
qu'ils ont fait à mon cocktail!
Allez, qui veut un vermouth
de cassis?
Bravo, soldats!
Leur vaisseau mère est pulvérisé!
- Mais, qu'est-ce donc?
- On dirait le vaisseau mère!
- Mais, que venons-nous de détruire?
- Le Télescope Hubble.
N'explosez pas avant la cible!
Ca ne sert à rien!
Quitte à être réduits en bouillie,
mieux vaut que ça soit chez nous!
Vous serez le capitaine!
Vous, le livreur!
Vous, le robot alcoolique
voleur et vantard...
Bon Dieu, ils sont vivants!
Enfin, grâce à Dieu,
vous êtes en vie!
Désolé! Je vous appelle dans trois
jours, voire une semaine!
Nous voulons Mac Neal,
sans plus attendre!
Voici les mensonges
du Président Mac Neal.
Le peuple de la Terre comprend mon
refus de me livrer aux envahisseurs!
La destruction totale est un petit
prix à payer comparé à...
Le voilà!
Prenez le colis!
- Vous n'êtes pas Mac Neal!
- Hein?
- Vous n'êtes pas le bon Mac Neal!
- Merci, gloire à vous, je...
- Donnez-le-nous!
- C'était lui!
Non!
Elle est célibataire et avocate!
- Elle porte des minijupes!
- Intéressant!
Une minijupe?
Ca me rappelle quelqu'un!
C'est une femelle humaine
non-mariée...
qui se bat pour réussir dans
un monde de mâles humains!
Voilà une excuse
de son incompétence!
Silence! N'essayez plus de nous
duper. Voici la vraie Mac Neal!
- Attendez, je la connais!
- Gros menteur, je ne te crois pas!
Et comment?
T'es toujours devant la télé!
C'est là que je l'ai vue,
c'est Jenny Mac Neal!
C'était héroïne d'une série du 20ème
siècle, Célibataire et Avocate.
S'ils viennent voir une série
télé qui a disparu depuis 1000 ans...
ils vont être décus!
On augmentera la température de la
planète d'un million de degrés...
par jour sauf si on voit Mac Neal
à 9 h pile, demain soir!
C'est clair?
Je commence à croire qu'ils ne nous
forceront pas à nous accoupler!
Ils vont détruire la Terre...
s'ils ne voient pas cette série
avec l'avocate vulgaire!
Comment connaissent-ils
une série qui a 1000 ans?
Omicron Persei Huit est à 1000
années lumières de la Terre.
Les sondes, émises au 20ème siècle,
viennent d'y arriver!
- Tu vois?
- J'ai compris!
En 1999, le dernier épisode de
Célibataire et Avocate...
fut interrompu,
dû à un problème technique.
Un abruti aurait renversé
son café sur l'émetteur!
Sa bière! Enfin, je crois.
S'ils veulent cet épisode,
on leur file la cassette!
Aucune copie disponible.
Toutes les vidéos de cette époque,
ont été détruites en 2428...
lors de la seconde venue
de Jésus!
J'ai vu les 30 premières
secondes de cet épisode.
Je pourrai écrire une fin
et on la joue!
Je ferai les costumes!
J'ai un vieil émetteur
de télé, dans le grenier!
Moi, je pourrai diriger les acteurs!
Super, alors au boulot!
Tu vas jouer le rôle de Jenny...
Pas question!
1, je suis pas photogénique...
2, j'aurai la gorge serrée face
à un public armé de rayons lasers!
Et 3, t'es pas assez bien faite
pour porter une minijupe!
Donne-moi le scénario!
En place!
D'accord...
Parfait!
Lumières!
Caméra une!
Caméra deux!
Caméra trois!
Y a une machine à café...
on pourra s'y retrouver
et discuter de la série!
Célibataire et Avocate
Elle se bat pour ses clients
Elle porte des minijupes sexy
Et a confiance en elle
J'assure!
Vous êtes accusée de subornation de
jury lors d'une précédente affaire...
due à votre liaison torride avec le
premier juré, que plaidez-vous?
Je compte plaider la relaxe...
vu ma liaison tout aussi torride
avec le premier juré, ici présent.
On se verra après l'audience,
chérie!
Si elle veut être respectée, pourquoi
elle n'arrache pas la tête du juge?
On a bien raison de dire:
Les femmes sont d'Omicron Persei 7.
Les hommes sont d'Omicron Persei 9.
Le témoin est à vous,
procureur Ramirez.
Célibataire et Avocate, où étiez-vous
dans la nuit du 23 août?
- J'étais dans votre lit!
- Ah ah!
Revenons-en à notre affaire...
S'il plaît à la cour...
Y a rien d'autre dans le texte!
Tu n'as écrit que deux pages!
Une heure pour les écrire,
une heure pour les lire!
- Que fait-on?
- Je sais plus!
Dis ce que tu veux, sois captivante,
envoûtante, fais un tour de force!
Que dites-vous Mlle Mac Neal?
Je dis que je quitte le barreau!
Et je ne veux plus être célibataire!
Votre honneur,
voulez-vous m'épouser?
La pub, tout de suite!
On se retrouve après Crazy Bender:
Le spécialiste du discount!
- Se marier? Pas question!
- Pourquoi? C'est habile, imprévu!
Les gens veulent pas
voir ca à la télé!
Si c'est intellectuel,
ils se sentiront bêtes!
Si c'est trop inattendu,
ça va les effrayer!
Attention, Mac Neal! Votre absurde
projet de mariage nous effraie!
Vous nous séduisez car vous êtes
célibataire et avocate.
Alors, restez-le, ou sinon!
Les gens n'aiment pas la nouveauté!
Ils veulent ce qu'ils ont déjà
vu plein de fois!
- Qu'est-ce que tu racontes?
- Ayez confiance!
Alors que les gens vivaient leur vie,
je regardais la télé!
Car j'ai toujours su
que j'allais sauver le monde!
Et il ne m'aurait plus payé mon
arrêt maladie si j'étais sorti!
Action!
Mlle Mac Neal, je décline votre
offre de mariage...
car vous voyez, je suis mourant.
Il tousse et meurt d'une attaque.
Mon Dieu, il est décédé!
Ma plaidoirie sera courte:
Mon fiancé est mort...
je vais poursuivre ma
carrière d'avocate célibataire...
tant pis si on y trouve à redire!
Nous déclarons l'accusée
aussi charmante qu'innocente!
Hourra!
Et... coupez!
Célibataire et Avocate
Elle a des tas de mecs...
Hein?
Nous sommes à peu près satisfaits
de ce que nous venons de voir.
Disons que ça vaut 11 sur 20,
juste la moyenne!
Nous n 'allons donc pas
détruire votre planète!
Mais on ne vous donnera pas
le secret de notre immortalité!
Vous en avez trop fait, Zoidberg!
Nous retournons sur notre planète...
voir un épisode de Seinfeld,
vieux de 1000 ans!
- Tu as réussi, mon frère!
- Oui!
Il suffisait de connaître le secret
des feuilletons!
A la fin, tout rentre dans l'ordre
et tout est comme avant!

Slurm. On en devient vite accroc!
Regarde! C'est Slurms McKenzie!
C'est toujours la fÍte avec lui!
On se fait une petite fÍte?
Tu as vu comment il assure!
Qui dit qu'il y a plus de hťros?
Hť, les potes! «a vous dirait
une fÍte dťmente avec moi...
lŗ oý on fabrique le Slurm,
sur la planŤte Vermulia.
GAGNEZ UN VOYAGE!
Trouvez une capsule en or
au fond d'une boÓte de Slurm.
J'ai gagnť!
Les chances de gagner
sont insignifiantes.
Ce serait chouette que je gagne.
Non, c'est rien.
C'est encore une dent.
EN DIRECT D'OMICRON PERSEI 8
Buvez du Slurm
Perdu pauvre naze
J'arriverai ŗ la trouver
cette capsule en or.
Je n'avais jamais vu personne
boire autant de Slurm.
Au lycťe, je buvais des centaines
de boÓtes de cola par semaine.
J'ai dŻ arrÍter
ŗ ma 3Ťme crise cardiaque.
- Bender, qu'est-ce que tu as?
- Je suis malade.
Tu n'as pas l'air bien.
Fais-moi voir si tu as de la fiŤvre.
Si l'on en croit son thermomŤtre
externe, que vous devriez utiliser...
il a une sacrťe fiŤvre.
Presque 900 degrťs.
Venez, Bender.
Allongez-vous, mon vieux.
Vous le rembourserez!
Je vais l'examiner, mais je suis
un expert en humains, pas en robots.
Je suis pas Bender. Je suis Fry.
- J'ťtais sŻr que vous ťtiez un robot.
- Non. Juste humain.
Bon, Áa va. Commencez pas
ŗ raconter votre vie.
Dites-moi oý vous avez mal.
J'ai des dťcharges ťlectriques qui
me brŻlent partout dans le corps.
Ne vous en faites pas. Ca va aller.
Mon Dieu.
Je n'ai pas eu le courage de le lui
dire. Ses branchies sont intactes.
Il flottera le ventre en l'air
avant demain matin.
Tu devrais essayer l'homťopathie.
Prends un peu de zinc.
- Je suis en zinc ŗ 40%.
- Dans ce cas, prends de la valťriane.
Ou un bon vieux placebo.
Tout Áa, c'est la mÍme chose.
Ca fait un drŰle de bruit,
ŗ l'intťrieur.
C'est peut-Ítre ce qui provoque
sa maladie.
Ca me fournit un prťtexte
pour essayer ma nouvelle invention.
Tous au laboratoire!
Ceci est une torche ŗ rayons F.
Les rayons F permettent de voir ŗ
travers n'importe quoi, mÍme le mťtal.
Le champ de neutrino
ťmis par la torche est dangereux...
veuillez donc tous
mettre des lunettes.
Il se peut que vous ressentiez
un picotement. Vous aussi.
- Voici la cause de la maladie.
- Hť, c'est ma montre!
Je me demandais oý je l'avais mise.
Je me sens dťjŗ beaucoup mieux!
Merci, professeur.
Et toi, Amy,
pardon d'avoir volť ta montre.
Je dois porter Áa tout de suite
ŗ la dťcontamination.
Mettez cette torche en lieu sŻr.
Imaginez ce qui arriverait si elle
tombait entre de mauvaises mains.
- On regarde ŗ travers quoi en 1er.
- Essaie sur moi.
Ca fait mal!
Gťnial. Ca t'ennuie si j'essaie
encore une fois?
J'ai pas eu mal, cette fois.
Oh, la vache. Voilŗ ce que j'appelle
une fille sexy.
- Quoi?
- C'est pas une vraie fille!
C'est la 1Ťre fois que tu vois
un robot drag-queen?
Faut sortir de temps en temps.
- Quand on me cherche, on me trouve.
- Je peux facilement trouver mieux.
L'exposition prolongťe aux radiations
me donne une de ces soifs!
GAGNEZ UNE FETE AVEC MOI
Si seulement on savait dans quelle
boÓte se trouve la capsule gagnante.
Je t'ai pas entendu. Je regardais ŗ
l'intťrieur des choses avec la torche.
Attends une seconde.
Ca me donne une idťe.
Non. Fausse alerte. Non. Oui. Non.
Oui. Non. Attends!
Non. Oui!
C'est nul, votre machin.
On a regardť dans 90000 boÓtes
et tout ce qu'on a gagnť, c'est Áa.
Je veux plus voir une boÓte de Slurm
de ma vie. Qu'est-ce que j'ai soif!
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a? Ca ne va pas?
Tu y es arrivť!
T'as rťussi, Fry! T'as fini
par la trouver, cette capsule!
On a gagnť!
Quelle merveille!
BIENVENUE AUX GAGNANTS!
Bienvenue sur la planŤte Vermulia!
Je suis Glurmo, votre guide
dans l'usine oý on produit le Slurm.
On pourrait pas avoir
un Slurm gratos?
Vous aurez tout le Slurm
que vous voudrez...
quand vous ferez la fÍte avec
mon excellent ami Slurms McKenzie.
Super!
Tapez m'en trois, les copains!
Le vrai Slurms McKenzie!
T'es prÍt ŗ t'ťclater avec nous?
Je l'espŤre bien.
Il est payť pour Áa, n'est-ce pas?
Ouais.
Slurms doit faire la fÍte
toutes les nuits, sinon il est virť.
T'inquiŤte, j'assure.
Avant la fÍte, je vous invite tous
ŗ un fantastique voyage.
La visite guidťe de l'usine
oý tout le Slurm est produit.
On se voit tout ŗ l'heure, les potes!
Bon, ben, je vais me coucher.
Bienvenue dans ce monde merveilleux
et magique qu'on appelle...
l'unitť de production industrielle
et de conditionnement centralisť.
Regardez, y a des fleurs!
Et un bateau!
C'est quoi ces horribles
crťatures oranges?
Ce sont les Grunka Lunkas!
- Ils travaillent ici.
- Dites-leur que je les hais.
On descend la riviŤre de Slurm.
Observez nos mťlangistes au travail.
Ils ont besoin
de 900 ingrťdients diffťrents...
ainsi que d'une pointe
de charme enfantin.
Ils mťlangent tout Áa
dans de l'eau de source...
produite par notre gťnťrateur
d'eau de source.
Et, en dernier lieu,
on ajoute l'ingrťdient secret...
qui fait que Slurm provoque
cette dťlicieuse dťpendance.
INGREDIENT SECRET
- C'est quoi l'ingrťdient secret?
- Tout ce que vous voudrez.
- Mais pour de vrai, c'est quoi?
- Ca, on ne le rťvŤle ŗ personne.
De ce cŰtť, les Grunka Lunkas
amŤnent des myrtilles de pluton...
ŗ libťrer leur parfum en leur
prodiguant des massages sensuels.
- C'est les myrtilles, le secret?
- Non.
- Vous Ítes sŻr?
- Oui.
- Parce que l'ingrťdient secret...
- Ca suffit!
- Je ne rťpondrai plus aux questions.
- Pourquoi?
Regardez! On dirait que ces ignobles
nains oranges vont chanter.
Grunka Lunka Lunka lunkadidon
Un bon conseil
Posez plus de questions
Grunka Lunka Lunka lunkadidť
Le secret de Slurm
Jamais vous ne le connaÓtrez
A l'ťcole des questions
C'est trŤs bien d'en poser
Si vous faites Áa ici
Vous risquez d'en crever
On a r'trouvť des curieux
Noyťs dans le Slurm
Vous prťfťrez sans doute
Repartir en pleine forme
Vous devez rien entendre
Et rien demander
Grunka Lunka Lunka lunkadidť
Je vous paie pas pour chanter! Vous
rattraperez le temps sur votre pause.
- Gros lard.
- J'ai entendu.
Sur votre droite, vous voyez
le grand slurmmelier...
contrŰlant la couleur
et le bouquet du Slurm.
Je meurs de soif.
Puis, il le goŻte.
Il le goŻte, le regoŻte.
Et le regoŻte encore.
Je peux avoir un Slurm?
Les boissons sont interdites ŗ bord.
En revanche, il y aura ŗ boire
ŗ la fÍte de Slurms McKenzie.
- C'est quand?
- Bien assez tŰt.
- Bien assez tŰt, c'est quand?
- Qu'y a-t-il derriŤre cette porte?
- Rien.
- La rťserve d'ingrťdients secrets?
Grunka Lunka dunka dikrť
Pas de questions
Sur l'ingrťdient secret
Bon, Áa va. C'est bon. On a compris.
Pourquoi y a-t-il
des gardes armťs, ici?
- Grunka Lunka dunka digardes...
- Vous allez la fermer, oui?
Je peux renvoyer mon ťquipe et engager
des Grunka Lunkas 2 fois moins cher?
Tout ŗ fait. Ils croient avoir
un bon syndicat, mais il est nul.
Ce sont presque des esclaves.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais?
Je meurs de soif. Attrape mes pieds
et fais-moi descendre.
Non, c'est n'importe quoi.
Je vais me baigner dedans. Lŗ, je
pourrai en boire autant que je veux.
Au secours! Je sais pas nager!
Pourquoi t'as sautť aussi?
Tout le monde le faisait, je voulais
pas qu'on me traite de dťgonflť.
Mais oý sommes nous?
Vous avez vu ca? Tout le Slurm
s'en va par les ťgouts!
C'est pas du Slurm.
Il y a quelque chose de pourri
sur Vermulia. Regardez Áa.
VRAIE USINE
FAUSSE USINE
Ca doit avoir un rapport
avec l'ingrťdient secret.
Imaginez que l'ingrťdient secret
ce soit des Ítres humains!
Il existe dťjŗ un soda comme Áa:
"Soleil vert cola".
- Quel goŻt Áa a?
- Ca varie d'une personne ŗ l'autre.
Vous n'en auriez pas un
qui serre moins la poitrine?
Oui, ils sont...
Vous n'ťtiez pas plus nombreux
dans votre groupe, au dťbut?
Ouais! Fry, Leela et Bender
ne sont plus lŗ.
Je reviens. Attendez-moi ici.
Cachons-nous!
Regardez! Du Slurm! Enfin!
C'est tellement bon que j'en boirais
20 boÓtes d'affilťe.
C'est sŻrement ici qu'ils ajoutent
l'ingrťdient secret.
C'est encore meilleur
quand ils viennent de le faire.
Il est encore chaud.
C'est pas vrai!
Fry!
Fry!
C'est Áa l'ingrťdient secret?
Non, c'est l'unique ingrťdient
du Slurm.
Pas de panique, je suis lŗ!
Ca fait du bien.
Merci, Bender.
La sortie! On est sauvťs!
Votre Majestť, je vous ai amenť
les prisonniers.
Ainsi, mes amis, vous connaissez
le secret du Slurm.
Maintenant, il est hors de question
de vous laisser en vie.
Parce que tu crois
qu'on ne va pas se dťfendre?
Bon travail.
Vous avez satisfait votre reine.
- Merci, votre Majestť.
- Merci.
Vendre au gens quelque chose qui sort
de votre derriŤre, c'est dťgoŻtant!
Vraiment? Le miel vient du derriŤre
des abeilles.
Le lait vient du derriŤre des vaches.
Et vous n'utilisez pas de dentifrice?
- Du derriŤre de quoi, Áa vient?
- Mieux vaut l'ignorer.
On est venus pour la fÍte
avec Slurms McKenzie.
- Au fait, elle commence quand?
- Jamais!
A la salle des tortures!
Vous, mon mťtallique ami...
vous aurez l'honneur de devenir
174 boÓtes de Slurm.
Finalement, ce voyage
est vachement dťcevant.
Quant ŗ vous, on va vous immerger
dans du Slurm royal.
Un bain de quelques minutes suffira
ŗ vous transformer en reine Slurm.
Mais c'est une roturiŤre.
Son Slurm aura un goŻt infecte.
Oui! On va le vendre sous le nom
de "Nouveau Slurm".
Comme personne n'aimera Áa...
on ressortira le Slurm Classic
et on fera des milliards.
- Et moi?
- Je vous laisse rentrer chez vous.
- Ouais!
- Si vous rťsistez ŗ ce SuperSlurm.
C'est si dťlicieux que
vous en mangerez jusqu'ŗ exploser.
Ce qui me fait penser qu'il faudrait
protťger mon trŰne. Bon appťtit!
Je vous laisse.
Je vous fťlicite encore
d'avoir gagnť le concours.
Fry, dťtache-nous!
J'arrive! Je reprends juste...
une petite cuillerťe.
C'est pas vrai! ArrÍte un peu de te
goinfrer et viens nous sauver!
- Est-ce qu'on est fichus?
- Oui, c'est sans espoir.
J'arrive pas ŗ m'arrÍter de manger.
C'est trop bon.
Mais je vous laisserai pas mourir.
- Plus vite!
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
Je crois qu'il ťtait temps!
Non!
Je pourrais passer
sans ces saletťs de bras.
On n'est pas loin. Je sens l'odeur
fťtide de ces nains oranges.
- ArrÍtez, je vous en prie!
- Slurms McKenzie!
- Je veux filer d'ici avec vous.
- Comment?
J'en peux plus. Je rÍve de rester
chez moi et de regarder des vidťos.
- C'est trop demandť?
- N'y pense mÍme pas!
On a gagnť une capsule,
donc on a gagnť une fÍte avec toi.
D'accord, mais n'invitez pas trop
de monde. Pas plus de 10 personnes.
Ca, c'est absolument impossible.
Vite! Foncez!
DANGER D'EFFONDREMENT
- Elle gagne du terrain!
- Je vais la retenir.
Elle fait 10 fois ta taille!
Elle va t'ťcrabouiller.
Ca m'est ťgal.
J'en ai plus que ras le bol des fÍtes.
Je suis tellement fatiguť.
Ma derniŤre fÍte,
ce sera de vous sauver. Musique!
- Les filles?
- Oui, M. McKenzie?
Vous m'avez bien servi. Mais cette
fois, je vais faire la fÍte seul.
Il y aura d'autres fÍtes pour vous.
Maintenant, partez! Partez!
Au revoir et bonne chance, Slurms.
Bonne chance, gagnants du concours.
Et adieu.
Non! Nous sommes ruinťs!
Ils connaissent notre ignoble secret!
Mon ťquipage a fait
une terrifiante dťcouverte.
Il semblerait que le Slurm soit
produit par le derriŤre d'une limace.
Par le derriŤre?
Avec votre tťmoignage...
on va enfin pouvoir interdire
cette saletť de Slurm.
Interdire le Slurm?
Faites pas attention ŗ ce qu'il dit.
Quand grand-pŤre est fatiguť,
il dťlire.
Je ne suis pas ton grand-pŤre. Tu es
mon oncle et tu viens de l'an 2000.
Je vois, grand-pŤre.
On va se charger de la mťchante
limace. Ne vous en faites pas.
J'aurais aimť que Slurms McKenzie
s'en sorte.
Ouais, c'ťtait vraiment
le roi de la fÍte.
Qu'est-ce que vous diriez
de faire une fÍte en son honneur?
- A Slurms!
- A Slurms!
Hť, c'est pas si mauvais.

Comme c'est triste.
Vous voulez que je m'en charge?
LAXATIF POUR OIE
- T'as fini?
- La prochaine fois, je le garde.
Je dois avoir une canine
de rechange, à côté.
Le jaguar n'a pas voulu coopérer, mais
par chance, il m'a arraché une dent.
Bon, allons-y.
C'est quoi, ces cercles
dans la dent de Nibbler?
Je suis encore un peu sonné
mais s'il est comme les arbres...
ces cercles doivent indiquer son âge.
Bon courage! Il faudrait être
un génie pour compter ces cercles.
Il a 5 ans.
Joyeux anniversaire, petit Nibbler.
Comme il est mignon
avec sa nouvelle cape.
Je serais mignon aussi
si on me donnait une cape.
Qui veut jouer à planter la queue
sur l'asticot?
Moi! Regardez comme je suis bon!
RECHERCHE CIBLE
CIBLE VERROUILLEE
La foule est en délire!
Qu'est-ce que je gagne? Du fric?
Regardez Nibbler!
Oh, il tient une cuillère.
- Il est tellement doué.
- Vous appelez ça un don?
Approchez, vous allez assister
à un spectacle exceptionnel.
- Et il porte un chapeau!
- Chantons-lui "Joyeux anniversaire".
Eh oui, c'est aujourd'hui
C'est ton anniversaire
Un gâteau et des bougies
Pour notre petit Nibbler
C'est le héros du jour!
Regardez ça!
Bender, tu ne devais pas faire
la cuisine?
- Bon. Vous aurez un rôti de Nibbler.
- Fais un gâteau. Et cette fois-ci...
si quelqu'un doit jaillir du gâteau,
fais-le entrer après la cuisson.
C'est un gâteau que tu veux?
Je vais en faire un
que vous n'êtes pas prêts d'oublier.
Ca leur apprendra, à ces sales rats.
Mon gâteau sera si bon...
qu'ils ne pourront que m'aimer
et me vénérer.
UFS DE QUALITE VARIABLE
TROIS QUART ECREME
REFRIGERER
CUIRE
Voilà! Ces salauds vont voir
qui est digne d'affection.
Je n'ai plus qu'à vérifier
l'orthographe et c'est prêt.
Non! Dégage de là!
C'en est trop.
Joyeux anniversaire!
Bender, qu'est ce que tu...
Tu vois pas que je suis
aux toilettes?
Comment as-tu pu jeter Nibbler
dans les toilettes?
D'abord, j'ai dû relever la lunette.
C'est toujours énervant...
pas vrai, les gars?
Ca ne te fait rien? Imagine
que je jette Fry dans les toilettes.
Tu n'as qu'à essayer, pour voir.
Tu te fiches de ce qu'on ressent!
C'est faux!
Là, je suis désolé pour toi.
- C'est vrai?
- Oui. Un seul il injecté de sang...
Tu ne risques pas de gagner
un concours de beauté.
Nous sommes réunis pour dire adieu
à notre cher Nibbler...
parti dans un endroit,
où je rêve de pouvoir aller un jour:
Les toilettes.
Je me sentirais mieux...
si Bender avait conscience du mal
qu'il m'a fait.
Dites-moi tout, docteur.
Inutile de me ménager.
Votre famille a trouvé la mort quand
un avion piloté par votre fiancée...
s 'est écrasé sur votre maison.
Et vous avez un cancer incurable.
Tu ne t'y attendais pas, à celle-là!
Il ne comprend pas
les sentiments humanoïdes.
Je voudrais que Bender
ressente la même chose que moi.
Grâce au miracle de la science,
on peut arranger ça.
C'est encore une expérience
qui dépasse les limites...
qu'on ne devrait pas dépasser?
Le nombre de morts
dans ce tragique accident...
s 'élève maintenant à 54000.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites
avec ma tête?
- Je dois retoucher quelque chose.
- Faites-le sur Fry!
Tais-toi. Je vais t'installer une puce
de compassion.
Et il pourra éprouver des sentiments?
Non seulement il pourra,
mais il y sera forcé.
Quel fils de... Attention!
Oh, mon Dieu! Ca y est.
Encore une fois!
- Professeur!
- Ne bouge pas. Nous y voilà!
Je vais te régler sur la fréquence
émotionnelle de Leela.
Mon Dieu! Je déborde de sentiments!
Je ressens un violent désir...
de me gaver de têtes de maquereaux.
Ca, c'est moi, bébé.
Je suis moins intelligent
que Leela...
mais je suis soulagé
d'être plus mignon qu'elle.
- Ca, c'est moi.
- Merci de me couvrir.
Nibbler me manque
et je suis curieux et borné.
- Bingo!
- C'est elle!
Merci. Je suis contente que Bender
ressente mon chagrin.
Contente. J'aime cette sensation.
Ne recommence pas à pleurnicher.
Je ne pleurniche pas! Ferme-la!
La colère? Comment oses-tu
me mettre en colère...
avec ton il de cyclope
et ton animal crevé?
Merci de sortir avec moi.
Je me sens déjà un peu moins mal.
Tu sais ce qui te remonterait
le moral? Un chiot.
Un chiot?
Nibbler adorait manger les chiots.
- Qu'est-ce que tu as?
- Nibbler me manque.
- C'est vrai?
- Non! C'est ce que ressent Leela!
Elle ne pourrait pas boire et oublier
comme tout le monde?
- La jalousie! Tu te crois sexy?
- Quoi?
Les hommes te courent après parce
que tu t'habilles comme une traînée!
Ils sont attirés par ma personnalité!
Armando et moi allons prendre un café
à l'arrière de sa voiture.
- Ca ne t'ennuie pas de rester seule?
- Non, je m'amuse beaucoup!
Amusez-vous bien.
Je suis si seul. Je vais m'enfiler
un pot de crème glacée.
Un pot de...
La cuillère est dans le talc!
Je suis au bout du rouleau.
Je ne peux pas vivre
sans l'adorable petit Nibbler.
Si c'était un alligator,
il aurait survécu dans les égouts.
- C'est vrai?
- Ouais.
L'assistante sociale du cousin
d'un de mes amis en a vu un, une fois.
Les égouts...
Concentre-toi, concentre-toi...
Tiens bon, Nibbler!
Oncle Bender va venir te sauver!
Zut, c'est trop petit!
Pourquoi les humains ont-ils
inventé ce truc?
Tiens, tiens...
Bender: 1. Toilettes: 0.
On se retrouve de l'autre côté!
Bender? Bender?
Tu n'aurais pas vu mon sombrero?
Il s'est jeté dans les toilettes?
- Qui est le suivant?
- C'est ta faute.
Tes sentiments le rendaient malade.
Tu as raison. Je me sens si mal!
Super! Il se sent encore plus mal!
Allons le chercher dans les égouts.
Tu es folle?
Il y a des mutants là-dessous!
- Ils vont vous dévorer!
- Ils sont monstrueux!
Les mutants ne sont
qu'une légende urbaine ridicule.
N'en sois pas si sûre.
Les scientifiques pensent
que des humains ont pu muter...
à force d'être exposés aux déchets
toxiques et radioactifs...
et aux excréments de l'Amérique.
Dieu bénisse l'Amérique.
Les dames d'abord.
Oh! Bonjour l'arrière-goût!
- Quoi?
- Je me suis brûlé!
- Vérifie dans le guide.
- On est sous Park Avenue. La classe!
GUIDE DU ROUTARD EGOUTS 3000
Tu imagines? Tout ceci doit provenir
d'un dîner de luxe.
Attends! C'est quoi, ça?
Je n'aurais pas dû jeter le manuel.
Tu n'étais pas obligé de venir ici.
Je sais, mais Nibbler
me manquait tellement.
- Il était si mignon.
- Il était si gentil.
Ce déballage de sentiments
me donne la nausée.
A moins que ce soit ce truc.
C'est inutile.
Il vaut mieux rentrer.
Quelle direction, Fry?
D'après cette carte,
la seule issue, c'est ce tuyau.
Ca s'élargit au bout de 2 km.
- Idiot.
- Idiot.
Bon, c'est pas grave.
Je vais me renseigner
auprès de ces gens.
Des mutants!
Des mutants! Ils existent!
Je m'en occupe!
Arrière! Arrière!
Merci, beau gosse.
- Il n'y aura pas de bras de fer.
- Moi, j'ai trois bras!
- J'ai dit "bras de fer", pas "bras".
- Arrête. Il n'a qu'une oreille.
Vous devriez nous dévorer.
Vous êtes des mutants!
Des mutants?
C'est peut-être vous, les mutants.
Dwayne, tu t'es déjà regardé
dans un miroir?
Voici notre village.
Ce n'est pas Paris...
mais il a un charme que
je n'échangerais pour rien au monde.
- Mais vous habitez dans un égout.
- Peut-être que votre civilisation...
est l'égout d'une société au-dessus
de la vôtre.
- Non, on est à la surface.
- A la lumière du jour.
Ca doit être merveilleux!
On cherche notre animal domestique.
Il a été jeté dans les toilettes.
S'il a été jeté dans les toilettes,
il est passé par ici.
Comme tout le reste. Suivez-moi.
Tout ce qui est à nous
a été jeté dans vos toilettes.
Voici notre aquarium.
Et là, c'est notre bibliothèque.
Des bouquins pornos
et Ayn Rand.
Et voici notre église.
Vous vénérez un vieux missile
nucléaire?
Personne n'est vraiment pratiquant.
On vient surtout à Noël et à Pâques.
Viens voir papa, mon bichon!
C'est vrai que les alligators
survivent ici?
Non, c'est une légende urbaine.
- Et ça, alors?
- Des crocodiles.
On les élève.
Quand ils deviennent trop gros,
on les jette dans le subégout.
Il y a des submutants là-dessous.
Voyons!
C'est une légende suburbaine.
Alors tu ne crois pas non plus à...
El Chupakneebray.
El Chupakneebray?
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
Venez écouter la légende
d'El Chupakneebray.
Quand vient la nuit,
Il sort de son trou
Il se fond dans les ténèbres
De l'égout
Méfiez-vous
Car il sème la mort
Il vous mangera
Vous et votre alligator
- Crocodile.
- Si tu veux.
Nibbler adore le crocodile frais.
C'est son plat préféré.
Ca doit être lui, El Chupakneebray.
Hé, ouais!
Vous l'avez lâché sur nous?
Alors vous êtes nos pires ennemis!
Il ne vous ferait pas de mal.
On va vous aider à le capturer.
Impossible. Si la légende dit vrai,
il faut lui offrir un snackrifice!
Oui, une vierge innocente.
- Je suis volontaire!
- Bien essayé...
mais on a tous vu le site web
de Zapp Brannigan.
Je me fais honte tout seul.
- Elle fera l'affaire.
- Enchaînez-la!
Et déchire un peu sa chemise.
Ecoutez, quand El Chupakneebray
viendra chercher la "vierge"...
il tombera dans ce piège.
El Chupakneebray sera bientôt là.
La nuit tombe.
Comment vous pouvez le savoir, ici?
- La marée monte.
- Silence! La bête approche.
Nibbler! Viens ici, mon trésor!
Regardez tous!
Voici El Chupakneebray.
- C'est pas lui.
- Quoi?
Le voilà, El Chupakneebray!
Je m'en occupe!
- Fais quelque chose!
- J'ai trop peur!
Leela, tu transmets ta peur à Bender!
Si tu aimes Nibbler,
arrête de l'aimer!
Mais j'aime tous les êtres vivants!
- Même moi?
- En ami.
Raté!
Ecoute-moi.
Je suis un expert en la matière.
Le secret, c'est d'en avoir rien
à foutre des autres...
de ne penser qu'à ce que toi,
tu veux...
ce que tu mérites,
ce qui t'est dû!
- Il me faudrait un débardeur neuf.
- Continue!
Un débardeur à la mode! Et des bottes
de marque, incrustées de diamants!
Et un pantalon pour aller avec!
Et je pourrais m'offrir tout ça si je
n'avais pas à nourrir cette sale bête.
Bender est de retour!
J'arrive, Nibbler!
- Il va le tuer!
- Tu sais ce que je voudrais?
Un week-end en thalasso,
et du Toblerone.
Tu as réussi!
- Si on faisait un défilé de PQ?
- Non merci.
Venez écouter la légende de Bender.
Il est venu un jour avec...
J'ai plus qu'à attendre qu'on jette
une corde de guitare dans les WC.
- Quelle histoire ignoble!
- Tout ça grâce à Bender.
- Je t'aime, Bender.
- Je t'aime aussi.
Enlevez-moi cette saleté de puce
avant que je me suicide.
Bender, tu ne vas pas le croire,
la puce est grillée.
Tous ces sentiments étaient
les tiens!
Bender a finalement appris...
à respecter les sentiments des autres.
Non, je fais erreur.
La puissance de la puce avait triplé.
Et je ne sentais presque rien.
Bonne nuit, bande de nuls!
Je n'ai peut-être rien appris
à Bender...
mais lui, il m'a appris quelque chose.
A plus, les branleurs!
A plus!

NON CONCU POUR L'AN 3000
LA DECHEANCE DE BRANNIGAN
Bonne nouvelle!
On a une mission qui servira la noble
cause de la paix intergalactique.
- Non, il y a des dessins animťs!
- Dťsolť!
Que faut-il faire?
C'est pour l'Ordre Dťmocratique
des PlanŤtes.
DOOP, c'est quoi?
C'est un peu comme les Nations Unies
de ton ťpoque.
Ou comme la Fťdťration dans Star Trek.
Ce soir, on inaugure
le nouveau siŤge de DOOP.
- Que livre-t-on?
- Un objet nťcessaire ŗ la cťrťmonie.
- Les ciseaux gťants de cťrťmonie!
- On les livrera au plus vite!
D'accord, mais ne cours pas avec!
NOUVEAU QG DU DOOP
LA ZONE NEUTRE
Il y a vachement d'extraterrestres!
C'est hallucinant!
- Un buffet avec des muffins!
- Mesdames et messieurs...
bienvenue ŗ l'inauguration
du nouveau quartier gťnťral du DOOP.
Un lieu parfait pour une organisation
qui encourage la paix dans l'univers.
MÍme entre les InsectoÔdes
et les Varans de l'Espace!
- C'est comment sur Amazonis?
- Gros rats, lŗ-bas.
- Moi, ťcraser avec massue!
- C'est super intťressant!
Ca te dirait d'aller discuter?
On ne pouvait rÍver mieux
pour ce centre diplomatique...
qu'ici en orbite autour de Neutralia.
Quel est votre sentiment,
Votre Neutralitť?
Je n'ai pas d'avis, ni pour ni contre.
Je hais ces Neutres!
Les ennemis, on connaÓt leur position.
Mais les Neutres, on n'en sait rien!
Ca m'ťcúure!
Halte! Tiens, Leela!
Je crois qu'on s'est dťjŗ rencontrťs.
- Vous avez dťjŗ couchť, quoi!
- On apporte les ciseaux de cťrťmonie.
- Alors, je vous arrÍte!
- Pourquoi?
Et s'ils devaient servir
ŗ tramer un complot neutre?
Ils ne sont pas pointus.
Qui pourrais-je blesser?
Les Ítres faits de fil
de Nylar Quatre.
Un plan pour assassiner
un extraterrestre avec des ciseaux!
Encore une idťe de neutre!
- Quoi?
- C'ťtait un crime presque parfait.
Mais tu as oubliť un dťtail:
La pierre casse les ciseaux.
Mais, le papier couvre la pierre.
Les ciseaux coupent le papier.
Kif, on a une ťnigme.
Prends leurs papiers...
- et apporte-moi une pierre!
- Pourquoi?
Tellement belle et pourtant
si Neutre!
Emmenez-les au vaisseau!
Pour couper le ruban, le lťgendaire
capitaine du DOOP...
qui revient d'un pilonnage triomphal
sur Eden Sept:
Zapp Brannigan.
Pourquoi un homme devient Neutre?
La soif de l'or? Le pouvoir?
Ou naissez-vous avec un cúur
empli de neutralitť?
Monsieur, vous Ítes censť couper
le ruban?
Peu importe! Je le couperai d'ici
avec le laser du vaisseau.
Ce n'est pas prudent.
J'en ai ras le bol de t'entendre dire:
"Ce n'est pas prudent."
Hop-lŗ!
ANCIEN QG DU DOOP
WEEHAUKEN, NEW JERSEY
Vous Ítes accusť de l'explosion
du QG du DOOP. Que plaidez-vous?
- A 99%, non coupable.
- Que le procureur appelle son tťmoin.
Votre Honneur, je ne suis qu'un simple
poulet d'un lointain astťroÔde...
mais s'il plaÓt ŗ la cour,
j'ťcouterai tous les jurťs.
- RequÍte accordťe.
- Membres du jury...
reconnaissez-vous...
celui qui a fait exploser
le nouveau QG du DOOP?
C'est ce type!
- Allez-vous le reconnaÓtre coupable?
- On va se gÍner, tiens!
Le jury ne s'appuie pas
sur son propre tťmoignage.
Votre Honneur, l'accusation
en a terminť.
Les preuves sont accablantes.
Mais, au vu du service de Brannigan
et de ce procureur incompťtent...
la cour est contrainte de lever
toutes les charges.
Quoi? Votre Honneur, l'affaire
est close et le verdict rendu...
- mais je veux tťmoigner.
- RequÍte accordťe.
Mlle Leela, ŗ la date en question...
portiez-vous ou non
une jupe ŗ cerceaux?
C'est dťbile! Ce qui compte, c'est
que Zapp soit le pire des capitaines!
J'ai vu ce crťtin faire exploser
le DOOP de mon propre úil!
- Je voudrais interroger le tťmoin.
- RequÍte accordťe.
- On s'ťtait dťjŗ rencontrťs?
- Oui.
Et ce jour-lŗ, avez-vous
couchť avec quelqu'un?
- Vous Ítes toujours sous serment.
- Oui.
Veuillez dťsigner la personne
avec laquelle vous avez couchť.
- Et son nom est?
- Zapp Brannigan.
Et ce mÍme Brannigan n'a pas
fait exploser le QG du DOOP.
La dťfense en restera lŗ.
Je demanderai aux jurťs
de procťder aux dťlibťrations.
Votre Honneur,
le jury a ťtabli son verdict.
Nous dťclarons l'accusť coupable.
Vous perdez donc
votre grade de capitaine...
et Ítes exclu du DOOP.
Je voudrais faire une derniŤre
dťclaration.
Kif, viens tenir le drapeau!
Agite-le, nom d'un chien!
On peut enlever ŗ un homme
son titre et son uniforme...
mais pas son intťgritť ni son honneur.
- En plus, c'ťtait la faute de Kif!
- Quoi?
Vous perdez aussi votre grade...
et Ítes renvoyť ŗ la vie civile.
Un jour, un homme a tout.
Il fait exploser une station
spatiale de 400 milliards de dollars.
Et il n'est plus rien.
Ca fait rťflťchir.
Ca m'ťtonnerait.
Il est temps de commencer notre vie
de civil. C'est un ordre, soldat!
C'est la 3Ťme bataille
d'eau, aujourd'hui!
Et la 2Ťme avec des tuyaux
d'arrosage!
Bougez-vous et nettoyez ce vaisseau!
- Pas la peine de t'ťnerver!
- Fry a dťjŗ enlevť un peu de saletť.
Je ne savais plus oý me tourner.
- Tu es la seule qui m'ait aimť.
- C'est faux.
- Physiquement.
- Que veux-tu?
Bosser pour manger. Je peux peindre,
te satisfaire sexuellement, nettoyer.
- Tu ne sais rien faire de cela!
- Kif saurait, lui.
- A qui parlez-vous?
- A un clodo qui a touchť le fond...
- et ŗ son commandant.
- Vous Ítes ce capitaine dťshonorť!
Il empÍcherait qu'on remarque
nos fautes de sťcuritť. Venez!
J'aimerais vous prťsenter ŗ nos
nouveaux employťs. Ce sont lesquels?
- Le mec en vert et le gros lard.
- Je n'ai jamais vu ce robot non plus.
Je suis Bender,
l'adorable fripouille!
Oh, mais oui!
Mon ami, bien sŻr!
Qui que vous soyez,
j'ai une bonne nouvelle.
Vous ferez une livraison sur Stumbos
Quatre. La gravitť y est si forte...
que vous serez ťcrasťs
par le poids de vos cheveux.
Amusez-vous bien!
Donc, cette Leela...
C'est une femme trŤs sensuelle.
- Et que vaut-elle comme capitaine?
- Stricte.
- Et mťchante.
- Je vois.
- Donne-t-elle des fessťes?
- Non, elle nous donne que du boulot.
Bien. Mais si elle devait instaurer
une politique de fessťe dťculottťe...
je prendrais votre place!
Rien ne pourra vous arriver!
Hť, ce type est bien!
A nous, pauvres andouilles
sous le joug de ce chef!
MÍme si ce chef est super sexy!
- Donnťes d'atterrissage calculťes.
- Merci. Excellent travail.
- Quoi?
- J'ai dit: "Excellent travail."
C'est le plus beau jour de ma vie.
Bon, votre travail consiste ŗ livrer
ces 40 oreillers ŗ cet hŰtel.
C'est pas lourd.
Mais je me plains quand mÍme!
C'est gr‚ce ŗ notre pompe
anti-gravitť.
Mais une fois ŗ terre,
la gravitť sera intense.
Pas de problŤme!
Ce tablier en plomb me protťgera.
Pas de plans foireux!
Utilisez l'aťro-chariot
et un seul oreiller ŗ la fois!
- Si on les prenait tous d'un coup?
- Ouais!
Ca carbure lŗ-dedans!
Ma gaine doit tenir!
Elle doit tenir...
Que s'est-il passť?
Il y a eu de la casse avec le chariot.
C'est tout ce qu'on sait.
Je vous avais dit
de ne pas le surcharger.
- Ici, un oreiller pŤse 70 kg.
- Tu vas pas en faire une histoire!
- Il y a le chariot de secours.
- J'y vais!
Pas question. Vous avez dťsobťi...
donc, vous livrerez les oreillers
ŗ la force de vos bras.
J'ai une question importante:
La boÓte qui fait tes soutifs
fait aussi des gaines?
- Car j'ai un ami...
- Au boulot!
- Je suis Leela. Au boulot!
- Ouais, c'est Áa!
C'est si humiliant de travailler
pour lui.
Une fois, il m'a ordonnť de...
lui raser les aisselles pendant
qu'il prenait son bain. Alors, je...
On ne pourrait pas parler
d'autre chose que de Zapp?
Ah bon, trŤs bien.
Bon, si on parlait de...
Donc, il ťtait dans son bain,
d'accord?
De la bonne pluie ŗ forte gravitť!
Ca va nous faire du bien!
C'est la faute de Leela!
Avec le chariot de secours, on aurait
pu le casser et on serait rentrťs.
Un bon capitaine doit avoir
des qualitťs...
comme l'audace, le courage
et un uniforme en velours.
Je ne pense pas que Leela
en ait une seule!
Elle n'est pas si mťchante.
Elle nous fait juste trop bosser.
Quand j'ťtais capitaine,
je n'exigeais que le dťvouement.
AprŤs, Áa m'ťtait ťgal
si mes hommes...
buvaient de la biŤre en slip!
- De la biŤre?
- En slip?
Mais maintenant, Zapp n'est plus
capitaine. Je suis libre!
Vous entendez Áa? Je rigole!
Ceci est une mutinerie!
Dťgage de lŗ, ma jolie!
Zapp est le nouveau capitaine.
Salut ŗ toi, nouveau capitaine!
Leela, tu es sacrťment efficace...
- mais tu perds ton poste.
- Pour quels motifs, bouffon?
"Incapacitť ŗ empÍcher une mutinerie."
Jetez-la dans la geŰle!
- Il n'y en a pas.
- Dans la laverie...
qu'on appellera dťsormais la "geŰle".
- Je ne peux plus Ítre capitaine?
- T'as pigť!
- Je faisais mal mon boulot?
- Tu ťtais dure et tu criais.
- Tu nous faisais trop travailler.
- Un capitaine doit faire Áa.
- Je croyais qu'on ťtait amis.
- Eh bien...
- T'aurais pas dŻ Ítre si mťchante.
- T'en fais pas!
BientŰt quand on y repensera,
on en rigolera!
Mon bon vieil uniforme!
Il me va presque encore bien...
mÍme aprŤs quelques entorses
ŗ mon rťgime!
- Et vos effets civils?
- Mets-les dans la laverie-geŰle!
- Serez-vous dťvouťs?
- Jusqu'ŗ la fin de l'univers!
- A 1000%!
- Ce n'est pas assez.
Buvez de la biŤre pour Ítre
aussi dťvouťs que Kif!
- A vos ordres!
- Je peux avoir une biŤre, chef?
Non. Tu es suffisamment dťvouť.
En attendant, j'ai un plan.
On va attaquer notre ennemi jurť,
la planŤte Neutralia.
- Oh, Seigneur!
- Et quand tout sera en ruines...
je redeviendrai un hťros et le DOOP
me renommera capitaine.
- Chef, ce plan n'a aucun sens.
- Peut-Ítre pour toi.
Mais si je me souviens bien,
tu as ťtť dťgradť.
- Dans les dents!
- Lŗ, il t'a cassť!
Prťparez-vous au combat
entre le Bien et le Neutre.
Gťnial! On va faire...
Et ils vont faire...
et aprŤs on fÍtera Áa
avec des pancakes. Et je ferai...
Tout ŗ fait. A prťsent, au nom
de la justice et de l'honneur...
on envoie un message de paix
puis on dťtruit tout!
A vos ordres!
Hissez le drapeau blanc de combat.
CAPITOLE NEUTRE
NEUTROPOLIS
Ici Zapp Brannigan, du Vaisseau...
Planet Express.
- Je viens en paix.
- Peut-on lui faire confiance?
Tout ce que je sais, c'est que
mon instinct me dit peut-Ítre.
- Et maintenant?
- On s'ťcrase contre le QG.
L'incendie les tuera tous,
il n'y aura aucun rescapť.
- Et aprŤs?
- Votre mission sera terminťe.
Quant ŗ moi, je serai ťjectť
gr‚ce ŗ l'unique scaphandre ŗ bord.
- Une seconde! On va se faire tuer?
- Oui. Pour moi, c'est Áa Ítre dťvouť.
Aidez-moi avec ce scaphandre!
On doit transpirer.
Vous me mettrez un peu de talc.
- Leela, redeviens capitaine!
- Pourquoi? Il a supprimť la sieste?
Il est ŗ cours de biŤre?
Alors, c'est qu'il va nous tuer?
- On veut Leela comme capitaine.
- Une mutinerie?
Je n'aurais pas pensť
que ce jour viendrait. Kif!
- Tiens, un scaphandre pour enfant!
- Je prťfŤre rester avec Leela.
Car en fait, elle ťcoute
ce que j'ai ŗ...
Il a dťsactivť le pilotage!
On va s'ťcraser!
Leela, sauve-moi!
Et sauve-toi en mÍme temps!
Et mon banjo!
Et Fry!
D'accord. Il nous reste une chance.
- Allez-vous m'obťir?
- Absolument!
- MÍme si vous devez bosser?
- Ton Dieu m'en est tťmoin!
Prenez le chariot et dťversez la matiŤre
obscure dans le moteur gauche!
C'est lourd, ce truc!
- Et c'est chaud!
- Obťissez!
Votre Neutralitť: Alerte beige!
Si je ne survis pas,
dites ŗ ma femme: "Bonjour".
Vite, je ne veux pas mourir ŗ 25 ans!
A moins qu'on remonte le temps,
t'as pas de soucis ŗ te faire!
- C'est trop bas!
- Vite!
Rťussi!
Vous avez rťussi!
Personne ne sera puni
pour la mutinerie!
Quand Leela a paniquť, peut-Ítre
en raison de soucis fťminins...
j'ai pu, gr‚ce ŗ mon esprit vif,
sauver la situation.
- Cette histoire est-elle vraie?
- En bien, en fait...
S'ils ne le reprennent pas,
on peut le garder.
C'est la vťritť. Mon incompťtence,
ses rťflexes de fťlin...
cette histoire ŗ dormir debout,
tout est vrai!
Dans ce cas, Zapp Brannigan...
la cour vous restitue votre grade
et vos privilŤges de stationnement.
Viens, Kif!
J'ai du boulot pour toi!
Je vous appellerai et vous raconterai.
Tu sais que mÍme si tu es mťchante...
- tu es la meilleure des capitaines!
- Ouais, une nana d'enfer!
- On a une semaine de vacances?
- Non.
- S'il te plaÓt?
- Allez, capitaine!
- Bon, d'accord.
- Pas question!
- Bon sang!
- Mutinons-nous.

PAR LES CREATEURS
DE FUTURAMA
FORTE TETE
Vous approchez une zone
proche d'un autre endroit.
Un endroit peuplé de créatures
ou de miroirs étranges
Mais vous n 'êtes pas
au bout de vos surprises.
Vous êtes au seuil de
La Porte des Ténèbres
LA PORTE DES TENEBRES
Comme convenu, vous trouverez
ci-joint le dernier homme sur terre.
Enfin, seul!
J'ai toute l'éternité pour lire.
C'est pas juste.
C'est pas juste!
Bon, j'arrive quand même à lire
les livres à gros caractères.
C'est pas...
Bon, je sais lire le braille.
Regarde ce drôle de miroir.
Il est prisonnier de son orgueil.
Zappe, y a un débat
sur l'autre chaîne.
C'est ce qu'a dit Fry
quand on a mis le débat.
C-Span 9 présente
"Au cœur de la politique."
Y a pas de scène d'action...
mais l'un de ces deux types deviendra
président du Monde.
On s'en fout. On vit aux Etats-Unis.
Les Etats-Unis font partie du monde.
Je suis un peu largué.
Il est temps que quelqu'un
se lève pour dire:
"Je suis de l'avis général."
J'estime mon adversaire.
Il est respectable.
Mais à dire vrai, je partage
complètement son avis!
Ces candidats ont l'air de clones.
Mais oui, ce sont des clones!
Ils ont beau avoir le même ADN,
ils s'opposent sur le fond.
Vous dépassez les bornes
avec votre taxe sur le titane!
Et vous, vous êtes trop timoré
avec votre taxe sur le titane.
Si je pouvais voter,
je participerais...
de chez moi,
en me déguisant en clown.
- T'es pas inscrit?
- Ni vacciné, d'ailleurs!
De toute façon,
on n'est pas à une voix près.
Faux! Le premier robot président
l'a emporté d'une voix.
John Quincy Addition.
Il a séduit les électeurs en
promettant d'éviter un bain de sang.
Mais, comme la plupart,
il n'a pas tenu ses promesses.
Le fait est que chaque voix compte...
et quand bien même,
je te conseille de t'inscrire.
Brillante idée!
Allons nous inscrire.
D'où vous vient ce sursaut
de civisme?
Depuis que j'ai vieilli.
LES 100 PREMIERS INSCRITS
POURRONT VOTER DEUX FOIS.
Le hic, c'est qu'ils veulent dépenser
nos impôts...
pour les défavorisés.
On leur donne tout, à eux!
T'as qu'à joindre
un parti alternatif.
Y a que les zarbis et les mutants
dans les partis alternatifs.
T'es sûre? Je ferai plus gaffe
au prochain meeting.
- T'es de quel bord, Bender?
- J'ai pas le droit de vote!
- Parce que t'es un robot.
- Non, un criminel.
UNE CELLULE, UNE VOIX
LES VERTS
PARTI DES CERVEAUX-LENTS
Il faut subventionner à perte
la Planète des Cerveaux-lents.
Mais que vont faire les Cerveaux-lents
pour l'homme de la rue?
- Le doter d'un cerveau-lent!
- Facile à dire.
MOUVEMENT DE
LEGALATION DU CHANVRE
On fait des chemises
ou de la ficelle avec du chanvre?
Dave, il est pas là.
- On peut faire du shampooing avec?
- Ah bon?
Pas possible!
Faut que je relise cette brochure.
Comment protégerez-vous mon droit
de porter un arsenal de mort?
Primo, autorisation de port d'arme
systématique pour les savants fous.
100% d'accord! On fait des misères
aux savants fous...
et demain, on s'en prendra
aux étudiants fous. C'est sans fin.
Amen! Moi, je bouge jamais
sans ma dose d'anthrax...
pour chasser le canard.
Les humains sont craquants...
mais faut bien tester
les cosmétiques.
Je suis d'accord.
VOTEZ PARTI APATHIQUE
Voilà un parti qui me plaît.
Je m'inscris.
Désolé, vous n'avez pas le profil.
- Je m'en branle!
- Vous êtes des nôtres.
- Super!
- Exclu!
Je commence à me passionner
pour la politique.
JOURNAL DE LA CAMPAGNE
A 2 semaines de l'échéance,
on se demande...
qui deviendra le prochain
président du Monde?
Jack Johnson,
ou son adversaire, John Jackson?
Quels candidats exceptionnels!
Tous les humains sont des vauriens,
selon Morbo.
Catastrophe sur le satellite
de Saturne, Titan...
après l'effondrement d'une mine.
Bilan: 1000 robots ensevelis.
Bon sang!
Faute d'intervention,
les robots périront dans 300 ans.
Où en sont les opérations
de sauvetage?
Porte-parole de la mine.
On va fermer le site,
et oublier tout ça.
Cette catastrophe a fait flamber
le cours du titane.
- Je suis riche!
- Comment ca?
Je suis composé de 40% de titane!
Je vaux plus que tous
ces distributeurs de billets pourris.
- Oui, mais ça ne te rapporte rien!
- Tu crois ca?
- Ben oui.
- T'as encore rien vu.
Prêteur sur gages
Merci de votre confiance.
Fini de rigoler, bande de nazes.
J'ai décroché le gros lot.
Regardez-moi un peu,
et allez vous faire pendre ailleurs!
Dégage!
Je te file 5 $ pour ne pas faire
ce que tu penses.
T'as perdu 5 $.
Tu me files un coup de main?
Merci!
Salut, bande de ploucs.
Que t'est-il arrivé?
T'as changé de coiffure?
Non, j'ai vendu mon corps.
T'as vendu ton corps?
Bender, je sais ce que c'est.
Tu vas mener la grande vie...
mais tu vas dépenser tout ton argent
en bijoux et en vêtements.
T'es fou!
Comment tu vas vivre sans corps?
Les corps,
c'est pour les putes et les obèses.
Moi, j'ai besoin que de mon magot
et de ma tête.
- Tu vas rembourser ton usurier.
- Sinon, il me casse les jambes?
La belle vie!
Resservez-moi un martini.
Et bien secoué cette fois.
Super!
Misez tout sur le noir.
21 rouge.
Veuillez m'excuser, 33 noir.
Oui!
La fortune sourit aux fortunés.
On t'a mis la pâtée, Leela!
Bingo!
Tu m'emmènes dans ton auto?
T'as qu'à prendre une douche avant,
mon pote.
Désolé, c'est vrai que tu as un corps.
Ose me répéter ça!
De toute façon, j'en ai ma claque
de cet endroit.
Je vais rejoindre des têtes bien
faites comme moi, qui apprécient...
la poésie, la philosophie
et les chapeaux.
Adieu, rembourrages de cercueil!
Bon, qui est-ce qui me porte
maintenant?
MUSEE DE LA TETE
L'âge d'or des crétins
Quelles sont les têtes
les mieux pour moi?
A ton avis, Fry?
Salut, je suis la tête
de Claudia Schiffer.
Je vous reconnais.
Mais qu'est devenu votre corps?
Il m'handicapait dans ma carrière.
Il m'a suffi de faire la couverture de
Sports Illustrated en bonnet de bain.
Vous êtes canon.
- Mais j'ai quelques kilos en trop.
- Vous n'avez pas tort.
Panthéon
présidentiel
Présidents des Etats-Unis.
Des étagères solides
et la sécurité assurée.
Voilà un endroit classe.
Salut, poupée. On ne peut plus
me reprocher mes écart sexuels.
Excusez-le. Il ne se contrôle plus
devant les femmes plantureuses.
Je me souviens.
J'ai failli voter pour vous.
Mais plutôt que de voter,
je me suis défoncé à l'Hexomédine.
J'ai toujours pensé
que voter était superflu.
Sans blague, Ford.
Alors la robot-pute dit:
"C'est pas ma prise femelle"...
et mon pote lui répond:
"C'est pas ma prise mâle."
Bender, gros farceur,
tu me fais éclater de rire.
Je me plais bien ici. Combien ça coûte
de louer une cloche?
Désolé, c'est pas à la portée
du premier abruti venu.
Avec tout le respect que je dois
à Jefferson, Nixon et Truman.
Et si on le casait dans le placard
des candidats vaincus?
Bob Dole se sent seul.
LaRouche l'embête avec ses blagues.
- Très peu pour moi.
- Qu'est-il advenu de votre corps?
- Je l'ai mis en gage.
- Mais pourquoi donc?
- Comme vous avec vos dents.
- Pour payer ma boisson.
Je me souviens de mon corps.
Bouffi, blême et criblé de phlébite.
Un bon corps de Républicain.
Et j'en suis fier.
Je comprends. J'ai passé mon enfance
à m'admirer. Pas évident...
Fry, il a renoué des relations
avec la Chine. Arrête ton verbiage.
Même si le corps vous manque,
c'est bien d'être une tête, non?
Non, mon fils.
Ca isole des autres.
Et vous me le dites maintenant!
C'est mon style.
Je ne suis fort qu'avec les faibles.
RESIDENCE DES ROBOTS
Des 1, des 0...
- Bender, qu'y a-t-il?
- Un cauchemar.
Y avait des 1et des 0 partout.
J'ai même cru voir un 2!
T'as dû rêver, Bender.
Les 2, ça n'existe pas!
Je sais ce qui se passe. Mon corps
m'aimait et je lui ai tourné le dos.
Mon pote, réjouis-toi,
on va se retrouver!
Vous avez vendu mon corps?
Mais à qui?
Secret professionnel.
Mais je vous offre 50 $ pour le gosse.
- Mais c'est le prix de mes fringues.
- Vendu!
Comment ai-je laissé faire ça?
Je ne peux pas continuer comme ça!
- Et ton bouton auto-destructeur?
- Mais il est sur mon corps!
Que vais-je devenir?
Je ne supporte pas de voir un robot
pleurer. Regardons la télé.
Mesdames et messieurs, je me lance
tête baissée dans la mêlée.
Je vais me présenter
à la présidence de la Terre!
Monsieur, selon la Constitution...
le président n'est pas rééligible
deux fois.
Non, mais moi, j'ai toute ma tête.
Et regardez,
j'ai un corps flambant neuf!
Bender, il a récupéré ton corps!
Sale traître!
Comment a-t-il pu rejoindre Nixon!
- Nixon l'a acheté au mont-de-piété.
- Avec la guitare électrique!
Je fais le premier pas,
bande de hippies dégénérés.
Je n'ai pas une tête d'escroc.
Mais si!
Vous m'avez volé mon corps.
Fry, Leela, aidez-moi.
Je devrais refuser
pour te donner une leçon.
Mais quand un Nixon robotique
est en cavale, il faut intervenir!
Crétin.
CE SOIR:
DEBAT PRESIDENTIEL
DEMAIN: RIXE
ENTRE LES VICE-PRESIDENTS
Voici les candidats en lice.
Le gringalet humain numéro 1.
Le gringalet humain numéro 2.
Et mon bon ami, Richard Nixon.
Salut, Morbo.
Que devient la famille?
Ils sont belliqueux et nombreux.
Parfait. Je suis pour la guerre
et pour la famille.
Il me vole mon corps et maintenant
il me touche le matériel!
Il faut trouver un moyen
de lui parler.
J'exige une réponse
à la question suivante:
"Si vous voyez un enfant
avec un bonbon dans la main...
est-ce que vous le lui chiperiez?"
En aucun cas!
Pas question!
Et vous, M. Nixon?
Attention au vérito-scope!
La question est ambiguë...
De quel sorte de bonbon s'agit-il?
Est-ce que quelqu'un surveille?
Mais je ne ferais aucun mal à l'enfant.
ATTENTION A
VOTRE CHAPEAU ET MANTEAU
Vous remontez dans les sondages.
Comment ca?
Ils m'ont démoli.
Vous avez joué sur votre physique:
"Visez mon corps tout neuf!".
Et les robots ont tout gobé.
Vous avez du charisme jusqu'au cou.
Nixon, charismatique?
Bon sang, je suis
le maître de l'univers!
Rendez-moi mon corps,
sale voleur!
Minute, sale communiste.
Ce corps, je l'ai acheté...
et j'y tiens autant qu'à mon chien.
La ferme!
M. Nixon, faites preuve d'humanité.
Pas question pour moi
de rendre ce corps.
Dégagez ou je lâche
une horde de Cambodgiens.
60ème PRESIDENT
C'est sans espoir.
Autant retourner ma tête à la consigne.
Pas question!
On ne va pas recycler mon pote.
Que ça rapporte 5 cents,
ou 500 cents.
- J'ai un plan.
- Et moi un encore meilleur!
TACHES SUR LES MATELAS
EN COULEURS
Que fait Nixon au Watergate?
Ils offrent une réduction
à ceux qui sont déjà venus.
Continue.
On te suit juste derrière.
Maman!
Trouvez-vous une chambre, vous deux.
- On en a déjà une!
- Alors perdez du poids!
Bon sang. Vous, les féministes,
vous savez vous amuser.
Allons-y.
Betty Friedan, enivre-moi
un peu avec cette lotion.
Parfait. J'y suis presque.
Du calme.
C'est pas le moment de paniquer.
- Vous avez du culot, sales pacifistes.
- Rends-moi ce qui m'appartient!
- J'ai envie de te tordre le cou.
- Te gêne pas, soupière.
Du calme, vous deux!
Ca suffit!
Je vous fais emprisonner.
Et pas question de grâces
comme ce poltron de Ford.
Tu ne gracieras personne,
parce que tu ne seras jamais élu.
Les électeurs ne sont plus autant
demeurés que de votre temps.
Ah bon? Ecoute-moi un peu.
Les ordinateurs ont peut-être doublé
de vitesse depuis 1973...
mais l'électeur est
toujours aussi alcoolique et stupide!
Je suis le seul à avoir changé.
Je suis devenu amer et cinglé.
Et une fois réélu, je vendrai
les organes des enfants au zoo.
J'irai chez les gens la nuit
pour tout casser.
Je ne vote plus pour lui.
Comme si on était à une voix près.
Bon, laissez-moi ramper jusqu'au
téléphone et appeler la police.
Pas si vite, Nixon! Les bandes
audio, ça te dit quelque chose?
Je n'aime pas la tournure
de cette discussion.
J'irai chez les gens la nuit
pour tout casser.
J'ai une voix comme ca?
Je pensais avoir une voix
à la Clark Gable.
On te propose un marché:
Les bandes contre le corps.
Ah, nom de nom!
C'est bon, j'accepte.
Je pense à un truc, soudain.
Quel plaisir d'être en entier...
mais je peux pas enlever
ces satanés auto-collants.
Le débat a stimulé la participation
qui atteint un taux record...
de 6%!
Les sondages créditent
ce filou de Richard Nixon...
du score calamiteux de 0 voix.
Enfin, le système marche!
Il est 7h59. On va dépouiller
les voix des robots.
Voici le vote des robots.
Nixon est élu!
Pourquoi voter pour lui,
alors qu'il n'est qu'une tête?
Je vous présente le nouveau
président de la Terre!
C'est le retour de Nixon!
Je n'en reviens pas.
Il a gagné à une voix près.
Je n'y suis pour rien.
Je suis déchu de mes droits.
J'y suis pour rien.
J'ai oublié de voter.
Bon sang, je savais que j'avais oublié
de faire quelque chose!
Morbo félicite notre président
cyborg gargantuesque.
Mort à ses ennemis!
Qui c'est le plus fort, désormais?
Toc, toc.

D'après une histoire vraie
CONTES DE NOEL
Mesdames et messieurs,
voici la tête de Conan O'Brien!
Merci, merci!
Nous allons commencer.
Max, allons-y.
Max n'a pas eu à manger!
Alors, on s'inquiète tous
du bug de l'an 2000?
Non! C'est réglé depuis 900 ans!
S'il vous plaît.
Donc, en venant au bureau ce matin...
Ca m'étonnerait!
Ecoutez, j'ai peut-être perdu
mes jambes à la guerre de 2012...
mais j'ai une chose que vous
n'aurez jamais: Une âme!
Et des tâches de rousseur!
Bon, je n'ai plus rien à dire.
Je serai la semaine prochaine
au Club Medusa.
Bon appétit!
Admettons-le...
La comédie est un art mort.
Mais la tragédie... Ca, c'est drôle.
Allez, tout le monde.
Un peu de ski nous fera oublier
les pitreries de Conan O'Brien.
- Bonne idée!
- On ne peut qu'espérer.
Belle neige.
Heureusement, on a évité
ce réchauffement planétaire.
On l'a eu, mais il a été
neutralisé par l'hiver nucléaire.
Assez de bavardage!
On y va!
Bon sang, on est coincés!
Au moins tu n'as pas le sang froid.
Par tous les lions de Zion!
Regarde le professeur!
Attention aux arbres!
Ouais, relaxe!
Couchés, les arbres!
Couchés, les arbres!
Super. Et pour les remettre debout?
Debout, les arbres!
Couchés, les arbres.
Ca roule ma boule?
Monsieur, vous surfez hors-piste.
Je m'en bats la rouille.
- Maman!
- Au secours!
PARCOURS DE BOBSLEIGH
Tu fais du bobsleigh?
Il faut que je voie ça!
Ecoute, espèce de sale crabe.
Il y a 1000 ans, la Jamaïque avait
une super équipe de bobsleigh.
Oui, je m'en souviens.
Après les J.O., elle s'est
mise à la pub pour alcools.
Un vrai modèle pour les enfants.
Un petit coup de main,
s'il vous plaît!
Bon, d'accord!
Mon pauvre. Que vous est-il arrivé?
J'étais sur une piste noire,
quand soudain...
Oh, excusez-moi.
Salut toi!
Rien de tel qu'un bon feu chaud
et un grand cognac.
Ca vous met dans l'esprit de Noël.
- De quoi?
- Noël.
"N-O-E-L".
Tu veux dire Elno.
Ca doit être une vieille prononciation.
Comme quand on dit, c'est quoi.
Elno?
Ce sera mon premier
Elno loin de ma famille.
Je peux te poser une question?
Ca te ferait plaisir
un arbre d'Elno?
Ouais! Un sapin à l'ancienne!
Ce ne sont pas des sapins!
Vous savez, un sapin quoi!
Les pins ont disparu
il y a 800 ans, Fry.
Finies les vieilles notions
de modestie.
Comme c'est vivifiant!
Ce n'est pas comme ça
qu'on fête Noël!
- Allons, allons.
- Tout a changé.
C'est faux.
Mon beau sapin
Roi des réfo
A chaque Noël, maman
nous faisait de l'oie hachée.
Papa faisait une super boisson
avec du bourbon et des glaçons.
Cette fête stupide me rappelle
tout ce à quoi j'ai renoncé.
- Arrêtons de parler d'Elno.
- Joyeux Elno! Joyeux Elno!
Des cartes d'Elno! Elno!
Amy, tiens. Fry.
Professeur. Zoidberg.
Un paquet pour Bender.
Super! J'ai reçu le plus
de cartes! Je gagne Elno!
Et enfin, la petite fleur du bureau:
Moi, Hermes Conrad.
JOYEUX ELNO,
MON FILS N 1729
Ah, une photo de ma maman.
C'est quoi ça?
Une carte de mon cousin Zoidfarb.
Au lieu de Père Elno,
il a écrit "Pince Elno".
Ca, c'est de l'humour. Les comiques
modernes ont beaucoup à apprendre.
OBJETS TROUVES
ORPHELINARIUM
BAL DE FIN D'ANNEE
Heureux
Souvenirs
Pourquoi fêter Elno si tous ceux qu'on
connaît sont morts depuis 1000 ans?
Je suis la personne
la plus seule au monde.
Un peu de compassion?
Mince! Qu'est-ce qui lui prend?
Elle est orpheline.
Oui. Et la seule de son espèce
dans tout l'univers.
Quelle vie solitaire!
Mon Dieu, pauvre Leela.
T'as besoin de réconfort, hein?
Bender va te faire rire.
Regarde-moi. Regarde!
Mince, il faut que je bosse
mon numéro.
Je me sens si moche.
Je me plaignais
alors que Leela est seule à crever.
- Je me donnerais des coups.
- Je peux t'aider.
Tu devrais avoir honte!
Il faut être aveugle pour ne pas voir
que Leela est une cyclope.
Fry, c'est lui là-bas.
Le réveillon d'Elno. Encore un autre
jour où je n'aurais rien fait.
La plupart des gens se réjouissent
pendant les fêtes.
Mais c'est aussi le moment de penser
à ceux qui sont moins chanceux.
Les Terriens ignorent encore
ce qu'est la souffrance.
Aujourd'hui, j'ai visité un foyer
pour robots sans-abri...
trop pauvres pour se payer...
l'alcool nécessaire
au fonctionnement de leurs circuits.
Quoi de plus triste?
Des chiots noyés, et faut-il encore
qu'il y en ait beaucoup.
Où vas-tu, Bender?
Faire du volontariat au bar du cœur.
Tu parles.
Tu n'as jamais rien fait de charitable.
Je suis très généreux.
J'ai fait un don de sang, une fois.
- Le sang de qui?
- D'un type.
Je dois montrer à Leela
que je suis désolé.
C'est difficile?
Mets-toi sur tes pinces
et fais la danse de l'excuse.
Gauche, gauche, droite...
Attendez, j'ai une meilleure idée!
Je vais lui offrir
le cadeau d'Elno idéal!
Un truc si génial qu'elle
ne sera plus jamais malheureuse.
- Reviens avant la nuit.
- On verra. J'aime bien marchander.
Dehors la veille d'Elno,
tu vas te faire tuer!
- Quoi?
- Il ne sait pas pour le Père Elno.
Mais je connais l'histoire.
En 2801, les Gentils Robots ont
construit un Père Elno robotique...
pour savoir qui a été vilain,
qui a été sage...
et distribuer les cadeaux en fonction.
Mais il y a eu un problème.
2801. Bref...
Attends, inconscient!
Dû à une erreur de programmation,
le robot plaçait la barre trop haut.
Donc il trouvait que
tout le monde était vilain.
S'il te voit dehors la nuit,
il te coupera la tête...
et te mettra plein de jouets
dans le cou!
Ravi de t'avoir connu.
CARTE-MERE DE LA MISERICORDE
BAR DU CŒUR
Bienvenue, mon frère.
Que la grâce d'Elno soit avec toi.
Je suis un de ces SDF paresseux
dont j'ai entendu parler.
Peux-tu me dire où est
la bibine gratos?
GALERIES EXTRAFAYETTES
Une fille que j'aime bien me trouve
crétin. Vous pouvez m'aider?
Il y a une cabine de suicide
dans la galerie. Il y a la queue.
Non, je cherche un cadeau.
Avant la tombée de la nuit.
Un cadeau classique
marche à tous les coups.
Un lance-fusée spécial Père Elno.
C'est vendu avec 3 têtes chercheuses.
- C'est marrant.
- Attention, monsieur.
Miam. Vous ne vous refusez rien,
vous les clodos.
Hé, chef, on est en train de te voler
ton mouchoir degueu.
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Puis-je avoir un peu de bibine?
Désolé, petit Tim.
Nous sommes à court ce soir.
Je comprends.
Mon Dieu, pauvre gosse.
Les magasins sont fermés. Il me faut
un cadeau pour mon amie Leela.
- Donnez-moi votre meilleur animal.
- Tout est relatif.
J'aime bien
l'escargot électrique.
C'est idiot! Vous êtes idiot.
J'ai dit le meilleur.
Lequel est plus cher:
Le perroquet ou le lézard?
1 $ pièce pour les lézards.
Le perroquet: 500 $.
C'est un sacré perroquet.
Mais ca me ferait 500 lézards
pour le même prix.
Ca plaît aux filles, non?
Monsieur, on ferme dans deux minutes.
D'accord. Je prends 500 lézards.
Non, attendez.
Le perroquet!
FERME A ELNO
J'ai dépensé tout ce que j'avais,
mais Leela va t'adorer.
Tu es bien bavard, toi!
La ferme!
Idiot d'oiseau!
Je sais où te trouver.
Tiens, c'est Leela!
Désolée d'être partie comme ça.
Je ne voulais pas gâcher la fête.
Tu étais partie?
J'en ai marre que Fry
ne pense qu'à lui.
T'as raison.
Au lieu de mettre la table, il sort
t'acheter un cadeau. Quel égoïste!
Il n'est pas rentré?
Sa vie est en danger!
- Pourquoi?
- C'est simple.
Le Père Elno va passer.
OK, l'oiseau!
Tu penses être plus malin que moi,
mais tu vas voir ce que tu vas voir.
REBORD DANGEREUX
Ne pas jeter de peaux de banane
Je te tiens!
- Salut!
- Leela! Mon Dieu.
Tu m'as sauvé la vie.
Je t'achèterai plein de lézards.
Fallait pas m'acheter un cadeau.
Je voulais te rendre heureuse.
Ma famille me manque.
Toi, tu n'en as jamais eu.
Ce n'est pas grave.
Tu es seul et je suis seule.
Mais à nous deux,
on est seuls ensemble.
- Joyeux Elno, Leela.
- Joyeux Elno.
Bon sang, c'est le Père Noël!
Vous avez été très vilains.
J'ai vérifié sur ma liste.
Revérifiez.
Je fais plus de 50 méga-vérifications
par seconde.
Vous êtes coupables
de ne pas penser à l'autre.
Plus maintenant. Fry a risqué
sa vie pour me trouver un cadeau.
Et vos autres collègues?
Vous avez pensé une seule fois
au docteur Zoidberg?
Non, je le jure!
Je vous ai apporté
quelque chose de très spécial.
Verrouillez les portes
Et restez cachés
Car le Père Elno va passer
- Hors d'ici!
- Attendez!
Vous n'allez pas nous offrir
un petit verre de cidre?
Bon d'accord. Mais juste un verre.
Ca suffit, maintenant.
J'ai dit ca suffit!
Prenez son sac!
Epargnez-nous!
On vous donnera des gâteaux.
Tu essaies de m'acheter?
Je te farcirai de charbon,
t'en vomiras des diamants.
On est pris au piège.
Je n'aurais jamais pensé mourir
sous l'arme du Père Noël.
Franchement, je n'y ai pas cru.
- Adieu, Fry.
- Adieu, Leela.
Regarde, on est sous le gui!
Ca ne vous portera pas bonheur
face à mon missile portable.
Faudra réparer ton cadeau.
Au quatrième jour d'Elno
Chez la petite dame, j'ai volé
4 photos de famille
3 bocaux de sous
2 anciens maris
Et un chausson sur un embauchoir
Oh, merci!
- Au secours!
- A l'aide!
Des humains!
On les attaque, monsieur?
Non, attends. Je les connais.
Ils ne possèdent rien.
Tu as été très vilain, Bender!
Je n'ai rien fait.
C'est le gamin.
Mon Dieu, Bender.
Tu te sers d'un orphelin?
C'est tellement vilain que je vais
devoir l'ajouter à ma liste.
Se servir...
V...
l...
R...
Amy, un cadeau pour toi.
Des peignes pour tes jolis cheveux.
Oh, c'est très gentil.
Mais je les ai vendus pour acheter
des peignes pour Hermes.
Quelle ironie!
J'ai vendu les miens pour acheter
ces peignes pour Zoidberg.
Merci.
Ca me servira pour mes nouveaux
cheveux.
Enfin! Je suis beau
et je me sens bien.
A l'aide!
Ils vont se faire abattre
devant notre porte!
Et pas de ramassage d'ordures
avant le 3 janvier!
Sainte Vache de Galilée!
Il est sur le toit!
Vite! Le cache-cheminée blindé!
Poussez, poussez!
Allez, du nerf!
Oh, non!
Vous avez tous été très vilains.
Vraiment très vilains.
Sauf vous, Dr Zoidberg.
- Ceci est pour vous.
- Une échasse sauteuse!
Quant à vous autres, je ferai
de votre peau du papier-cadeau...
et tapisserai les murs
de vos entrailles.
Ah oui? Moi je crois pas
au Père Elno!
Allez, les gars. Si on n'y croit pas,
il peut pas nous faire de mal.
Mon Dieu, comme ça fait mal!
Maintenant, je vais
vous botter le cul!
Attention, son ventre bouge
comme un bol de TNT.
- Le nez de Rudolph!
- Il va exploser!
Heureusement, je nous ai sortis de là.
Et voici le dîner d'Elno.
Bender, où est-ce que tu as trouvé
cet oiseau?
Dans la rue, comme tout
ce que je cuisine.
Allez-y, mangez!
- Merci.
- Tu as eu l'ergot.
Peu importe la nourriture.
J'ai tellement faim.
Ce qui compte
c'est d'être ensemble à Elno.
Et même si je suis entouré de robots,
de monstres et de vieux...
je me sens tellement bien.
Ecoutez! Nous allons chanter.
Il sait quand tu dors
Il sait que t'es aux chiottes
Il te bottera le séant
Tu voleras d'ici jusqu'au Pakistan
T'as pas intérêt à respirer
Ni à bouger
Autant crever
Mon pote, c'est la vérité
Le Père Elno va te farcir de plombs
Joyeux Elno à tous!
Je reviendrai quand vous vous
y attendrez le moins.
A Elno prochain!

Robot-Plombier débouche vos W-C
Et vous débouche
Si vous êtes constipé
Robot-Plombier!
Ca, c'est le progrès:
Un hot-dog à la chantilly
qui se réchauffe tout seul.
Pourvu qu'il me reste assez d'énergie
pour me ramener une autre bière!
BIERE
On est au Moyen Age, ou quoi?
Regardez-vous!
- Fry, t'es devenu un sac de graisse.
- Un sac?
Bender, tu as un tel estomac
que la porte ne ferme plus!
- C'est n'importe quoi!
- On vous emmène à la gym.
A la gym? Excellent! Excellent!
Je sais pas pourquoi mais,
je suis aussi gai qu'un pinçon.

C'est déconseillé aux crustacés!
Je vais aller me faire la pince.
- En forme, Dr Z?
- Yo, ça boume? Vas-y, balance!
Des saunas mixtes.
J'adore le futur!
Fry, tu es dans le sauna réservé
aux femmes.
Vive le futur!
Regarde comment ils étaient foutus
avant la génétique.
Je plains les femmes du 20ème siècle!
Salut, beauté.
Y a de la place pour deux?
Mais bien sûr!
Leela, t'as vu la bête un peu?
On a dû baisser la force de gravité.
Je vais réparer ça.
GRAVISTAT
BAS - NORMAL
Donne-moi ca!
Plus de poids!
C'est quoi, ce truc sur votre tête?
Posez pas de questions.
Rajoutez du poids!
Encore!
Encore!
Exercez-vous plus longtemps
avec moins de poids.
On dirait que Zoidberg est enfin sorti
de sa coquille. Pigé?
Il est sorti de...
En douceur.
Il faut éviter tout stress inutile.
- Y a-t-il un médecin dans la salle?
- Je suis médecin!
Pourquoi il se comporte comme ça?
- Il semblait être le plus normal.
- Je suis normal.
Amy, enlève ces élastiques
et je te prouverai que je suis normal.
Dupez-moi sept fois, honte à vous.
Dupez-moi huit fois, honte à moi.
- Il doit avoir un parasite.
- Peut-être que c'est lui.
C'est trop triste
quand un ami perd la boule...
et qu'on n'a plus
qu'à le faire cuire!
C'est hors de question!
Je vais lui administrer un sédatif.
- C'est mieux. Enlevez les élastiques.
- D'accord.
- Arrête!
- Andouille!
J'ai trouvé le problème.
Dites-moi vite. J'ai une nécrose
des nageoires? Dites-moi que non!
Détendez-vous, mon ami.
Tout va bien.
C'est une simple surcharge
de laitance.
Berk!
Ce doit être la saison des amours.
Sa conduite est alors dictée par
un cerveau situé dans son derrière.
- Je ne vois qu'une solution.
- Je mets l'eau sur le feu.
Nous, ou plutôt, vous devez le ramener
sur sa planète d'origine...
où il y aura une orgie
d'invertébrés.
- C'est quand vous voulez!
- Tu connais le mot "invertébré"?
C'est pas ce mot qui m'intéresse.
Pas besoin de vêtements, en route!
Zoidberg m'a dit de garder ça
pendant son absence.
Andouille!
SPACIOPORT PLANETAIRE
BIENVENUE AUX FRAYEURS!
Bienvenue. Plus que 19 heures
avant la frénésie de la reproduction!
FRENESIE
- Excellent! Excellent!
- A tout à l'heure, docteur...
Vous avez dit "Zoidberg"?
Pourquoi lui faire remarquer
son défaut d'élocution?
- Vous avez l'air moins cinglé.
- C'est vrai...
parce que je vais déposer ma laitance
dans la cavité d'une femelle...
si vous me suivez...
- Qui est l'heureuse élue?
- Je sais pas.
Je l'attirerai cet après-midi
avec ma parade érotique.
C'est dingue
comme vous trouvez vite l'amour!
"L'amour"?
Ce mot n'existe pas.
Je cherche une femelle pleine d'œufs
qui acceptera ma substance génétique.
Pareil pour moi!
Voilà le quartier où je traînais.
Allons voir.
Je venais là quand j'étais une larve.
Ca semblait plus grand, à l'époque.
C'est qui le plus balèze maintenant,
Vinnie?
Chic, des arènes!
Allons acheter des tickets!
Non, c'est la cérémonie
du pince-quick.
On lutte jusqu'à la mort
pour l'honneur...
et pour décider si les abréviations
comptent au Scrabble.
Je suis pas venu voir un combat.
Où a lieu votre parade érotique?
Au même endroit que vous.
A la plage!
CABINES MESSIEURS
- Comment vous me trouvez?
- Comme un vomi de baleine!
Alors l'illusion est parfaite.
Tu crois qu'ils sont là
pour regarder la parade, eux aussi?
Voilà, on va bien me remarquer
là-dessus.
- Ils ont l'air ridicule!
- Pas plus que les humains...
qui s'injectent de l'ADN
pour faire des bébés.
C'est choquant!
Touchez pas à mes œufs!
Vous n'êtes pas mon genre.
On me l'a déjà sortie celle-là.
A quoi bon?
Y a plus que lui. Pourquoi?
Car c'est un minable.
C'est l'équivalent de Fry en homard.
Je me trouve une fille quand je veux,
mais je suis trop occupé.
Edna!
Edna, c'est moi, Zoidberg.
On était au lycée ensemble.
Tu te moquais de mon visage
couvert de crustacés.
Je ne savais pas
que tu étais de retour.
Il paraît que t'es devenu
un riche médecin.
J'ai pratiqué quelques euthanasies.
Pendant que je suis en ville,
je me demandais si...
C'est-à-dire que je traverse
une période difficile et...
Ecoute, je porte plus d'œufs
que toutes les autres.
J'ai le devoir de choisir un mâle
qui regorge de laitance.
- Peut-être une rock star.
- Ou un médecin?
Je suis navrée.
Tu es un spécimen mâle inférieur.
Ravie de t'avoir revu.
Aucune ne voudra s'accoupler avec moi.
Pas avec cette pince ridicule.
Vous avez vu les autres? Des pinces
géantes avec le corps assorti!
- Vous sentez moins mauvais qu'eux!
- C'est vrai.
Ma glande odorante est nulle aussi.
Sens!
Pour conclure,
faites semblant d'être amoureux.
Regardez-la dans l'œil,
sanglotez et dites:
"Je n'ai jamais été aussi heureux."
Si un mec me faisait ce plan-là,
je le verrais.
Attends un peu.
Ils m'ont tous fait ce plan!
Même Sean!
Cet "amour" m'intrigue.
Comment fait-on semblant?
Vous avez rendez-vous.
Vous lui dites quoi?
- Que je veux la féconder.
- Non, qu'elle est spéciale!
C'est pas vrai. Elle a juste
plus d'œufs que les autres.
- Dites-lui ca. Et?
- Je la féconde.
Non. Dites-lui que vous avez
des sentiments pour elle.
- Comme le désir de la féconder?
- Faites un effort!
C'est trop compliqué... les fleurs, la
romance, les mensonges à répétition!
Le grand spécialiste de l'Amour
va vous prendre sous son aile.
Parce qu'il y a un oiseau aussi?
OK. Allez-y.
Qu'est-ce que...
Dr Zoidberg?
Ta parade ne m'a pas séduite.
Alors que fais-tu ici?
Je ne sais pas.
Vous voulez lui parler,
pas la féconder.
Je veux te parler, pas te féconder.
Fry, ça n'a aucun sens.
Dr Zoidberg, ça n'a aucun sens.
Mais, d'accord.
Dites-lui qu'elle a minci.
Tu as l'air sous-alimentée?
As-tu attrapé des parasites?
Oui. Merci de le remarquer.
- Faites-la parler de sa journée.
- Je m'en fiche!
- Faites-le quand même!
- Et cette journée?
Je me suis levée, j'ai déjeuné
puis je me suis lavé les dents.
Je suis allée chez le poissonnier...
C'est malin,
elle ne s'arrête plus!
C'est normal.
Contentez-vous d'acquiescer.
- Je vois.
...et tu m'as envoyé une pieuvre.
C'est surprenant,
mais quand tu parles comme ça...
tes déficiences flagrantes
paraissent moins flagrantes.
Tes gènes semblent moins nuisibles.
Même ton odeur est plus forte.
- Je la féconde?
- Au 3ème rendez-vous!
PRIMATE HUT
"Retrouvez le goût du singe"
Alors je lui ai rendu
son cœur artificiel.
Et depuis, on m'appelle
"l'honnête Bender".
"Je voudrais porter un toast à
ticket de vestiaire 84."
- De l'autre côté!
- Oh! Edna!
De tous les gros crabes répugnants
de cette planète...
tu es la plus sexy."
- J'ai rien entendu d'aussi beau.
- Oui. Eh bien...
je dois aller me repoudrer
les mandibules.
Moi aussi.
Je suis troublé.
Je ressens un sentiment nouveau.
C'est l'amour d'être attiré par
une femelle sans vouloir la féconder?
Non.
C'est pas un sentiment humain.
Zoidberg a dit n'importe quoi.
Mais c'est un chic type.
Il ne fait que répéter
ce que Fry lui dit. Fry est un...
- Vous avez des crétins, ici?
- Fry?
Ces superbes mots viennent
de la bouche de cet immonde terrien?
Oui. Hein?
Oublions les mots. Zoidberg
est un médecin. Un médecin, chérie!
Fry- on doit parler de Zoidberg.
- Edna
Entrez.
Bonjour, Fry.
Vous voulez des amuse-gueules?
Zoidberg est génial. Il a un paquet
de laitance qui sort des miches.
C'est normal.
Mais la laitance ne fait pas tout.
Je sais que ses mots magiques
étaient de toi.
Apprends-moi à aimer,
mon doux poète de l'espace!
Je suis flatté. Si je voulais coucher
avec un crustacé, je vous choisirais.
Tais-toi, grand romantique.
Amène tes mandibules et embrasse-moi.
Edna? J'ai pas pu attendre
plus longtemps. Je...
Fry!
Ce n'est pas ce que vous croyez!
- Son caviar est sur ton cou!
- Mais...
C'est vrai, Zoidberg.
On ne peut plus le cacher.
On est amoureux
et, demain, on s'accouplera.
- Quoi?
- Je te défie au pince-quick!
- C'est-à-dire?
- Un combat jusqu'à la mort!
Et si tu survis,
on fera l'amour tendrement.
La loi est claire!
Fry et Zoidberg lutteront jusqu'à ce
que mort s'ensuive pour la belle Edna.
- Je veux pas d'elle!
- Le défi lancé...
la tradition du pince-quick
doit toujours être respectée.
Cette tradition est récente. Elle n'a
que 18 ans, mais c'est une tradition.
Je vais t'arracher les nageoires.
Tu vas voir!
C'est de la folie!
Vous n'êtes pas raisonnable!
Evidemment, je suis amoureux!
- Leela!
- Bien, d'accord.
Vous devez arrêtez ca!
Ecoutez.
Comme vous pouvez le voir...
je suis un mâle très désirable
rempli de laitance...
mais j'ai fait vœu de célibat
pour perpétuer nos traditions idiotes.
- Un de vos amis doit mourir.
- Le destin est cruel et inflexible.
Mais on ne peut rien y faire.
Je prends les paris!
Zoidberg gagnant à 9 contre 2!
L'invincible! Faites vos jeux!
La fac de médecine est bien loin.
Rappelle-moi...
- l'éviscération, c'est mortel?
- Oui.
Un paquet sur moi au 1er round!
Edna, avez-vous quelque chose à dire
avant le début du pince-quick?
Tout à fait. Ce matin,
je me suis levée, j'ai déjeuné...
puis je me suis lavé les dents...
- La ferme!
- Je t'aime, Fry!
Non!
Fry, comme vous avez deviné
à quel animal je pensais...
vous avez le droit de choisir l'arme.
- Et vous, docteur?
- Je choisis mes pinces.
J'aurai le plaisir de lui couper
ses organes génitaux.
Ne dites rien!
Fry, je ne t'ai jamais rien demandé...
mais quand vous serez au 9ème round,
laisse-le gagner.
- Mais c'est un combat à mort.
- Tu ne penses vraiment qu'à toi!
Veuillez vous lever
pour l'hymne national.
Que le pince-quick commence!
Allez, Fry! Meurs avec dignité!
Non! Je refuse de voir ca!
Quoi?
Fry, fonce!
Pince-quick!
Pince-quick! Pince-quick!
Mes amis crustacés, je ne veux pas
critiquer votre civilisation idiote...
mais croyez-vous que tuer quelqu'un
avec un casse-noix peut aider?
Dr Zoidberg est mon ami, et bien
qu'il y ait une femme entre nous...
on restera toujours amis.
Savez-vous pourquoi?
Pour une seule raison...
Enfoiré! Je vais te tuer!
Enfoiré!
Arrêtez! Tout le monde est parti!
Edna? Chérie?
Edna?
Oh, mon Dieu!
La frénésie!
La plus grande expérience de la vie,
et je l'ai manquée!
Je suis navré, doc.
Morphine pour enfants
La frénésie est finie.
Comment vais-je évacuer ma laitance?
- Je vous prêterai ça.
- Fry!
- Hé!
- Allez-vous en!
C'est quoi, ces bestioles?
Elles viennent se régaler
après la frénésie.
Mes congénères meurent
après avoir transmis leurs gènes.
Vous devez choisir
entre une vie sans sexe et la mort?
- Oui.
- C'est pas évident.
Merci de m'avoir laissé
te remettre le bras.
Surtout après m'être comporté
comme une andouille.
- C'est pas grave.
- Si.
J'ai fait l'expérience
de sentiments nouveaux:
L'amour, la jalousie,
une passion pour l'éviscération.
C'est grâce à toi.
Voilà. L'opération est un succès.
Je touche pas ma bille en sentiments,
mais par contre, en médecine...
Je ne veux pas pinailler,
mais vous pourriez m'arranger ça?
Je ferai n'importe quoi
pour mon ami.
- Mes jambes!
- C'est rien...
la 3ème fois, c'est la bonne.

LA TETE SUR L'EPAULE
Il y a de cela un millénaire
et 145 années...
nos prestigieux ancêtres
ont créé une nouvelle nation.
En ce Jour des Présidents, sont fêtées
les valeurs que j'ai défendues.
Comme cette splendide Plymouth!
Salut! Je suis Eddie Débloque
et je débloque...
à tel point que je brade littéralement
toutes ces voitures!
Achetons-en une! Si j'avais des "B",
mes parents devaient me payer un bar.
Et j'ai eu que des "C"!
Je peux venir?
Mes fesses doivent être révisées.
Il y a des risques d'explosion
en cas de choc léger.
D'où ton refus de faire la chenille.
Je m'habille. C'est parti, Bender.
Eddie Débloque
LE ROI DE LA VOITURE-FUSEE
Je m'appelle Victor et je n'ai pas mon
pareil pour décharger des voitures...
sur des créatures de rêve.
Dites-nous
qu'elle est sophistiquée.
Un gentleman commence toujours
par vendre une voiture.
Ceci est une Beta Romeo.
Oui, une Beta Romeo.
Remarquez la ceinture croisée,
qui protège, soutient et écarte.
Elle vous a tapé dans l'œil.
Elle est splendide.
Elle fait du bon café.
Non, la Ford Thunder
Cougar Falcon Bird!
Il n'y a que ça de vrai
pour se sentir un homme.
- Combien êtes-vous prêt à mettre?
- Rien.
Vous vous fichez qu'on s'interroge
sur votre virilité, hein?
Non, bien sûr!
Mais qu'est-ce que je peux y faire?
La solution est devant vous.
Les sièges sont fourrés
avec du duvet d'aigle...
et le tableau de bord incrusté
de becs d'aigles.
Il y a même des aigles
sous le plancher.
- Ca fait beaucoup d'aigles.
- Oui, mais...
- Qu'y a-t-il?
- L'édition de luxe en contient plus.
- Dommage de passer à côté.
- Ne vous en faites pas.
Ce sont mes parents qui paient
et ils sont très riches.
SERVICE DE MAINTENANCE
Content de vous revoir!
Je vous ai mis des amortisseurs
antichocs sur l'arrière-train.
Vous avez défiguré
un trésor national!
J'exige que vous redonniez
à mes fesses leur beauté originelle!
D'accord, mais votre derrière finira
par exploser, et ce jour-là...
j'espère que vous ne tournerez pas
le dos à un être cher.
Cette voiture possède tout ce dont
a besoin une belle femme comme moi.
Victor me l'a dit.
Mon petit Victor,
t'as tiré le gros lot!
La pancarte indique 55000 $.
Mais on ne montera pas au-delà de...
60000!
Je dois en parler à mon patron.
- Pourquoi t'as dit plus que le prix?
- Je croyais que c'était une enchère.
- Il n'est pas très content.
- Désolée. Disons 80000?
Je suis nulle en créneaux.
Vous voulez prendre une journée?
Disparaissez!
Vous abusez de ma gentillesse.
Après qui en as-tu?
Moi-même. Je me suis demandé un
congé de Saint-Valentin. Quel culot!
C'est la Saint-Valentin? J'ai encore
oublié de me trouver une copine.
- On est seuls tous les deux. Si on...
- Tu crois que je trouverai personne?
20 heures, ça te va?
Je vais sur Mercure avec ma voiture.
Ca vous tente?
- D'accord. Il y fait quel temps?
- Comme d'habitude: Volcanique.
Je mets quoi? Un short?
Cette clim est incroyable.
Je vais mettre un peu d'air chaud.
AIR CHAUD
ESSENCE
SEULE ET UNIQUE POMPE
DE MERCURE!
L'air chaud est surpuissant!
Je vais pousser un peu la clim.
- On se fait des margaritas frappées?
- Ouais!
- On ralentit!
- J'augmente l'arrivée d'essence!
Qui veut un toast fourré?
ESSENCE: 7642 KM
C'est pas grave.
J'ai un téléphone de secours.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais?
- C'est un vidéophone.
Je suis à l'Association Automobile
Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amér-Asienne.
Allô? Le septuple A?
Ca prendra quelques heures.
Mon jogging
va être plein de transpiration!
En étant si riche, comment se fait-il
que tu t'habilles comme ça?
Parce que mes parents aimeraient
que je sois plus féminine.
Les miens voulaient à tout prix que je
mette des slips. Je suis pas le pape!
Si c'était le cas, ils te diraient:
"Ta tiare est de travers...
Ne mets pas cette chasuble."
C'est chouette de pouvoir parler
de ce genre de bêtises à quelqu'un.
Ouais, on a la même vision des choses
concernant ce genre d'âneries.
- Tu as envie qu'on le fasse?
- Ouais!
Ainsi se termine
le film que j'ai vu hier soir.
- Rien à ajouter?
- Non.
- Pas de révélation à faire?
- Non.
- Une histoire de fesses?
- Non.
- Si.
- Si on veut.
- Quoi?
- Mon Dieu!
- Une chose en a entraîné une autre.
- Qui en a encore entraîné une autre.
Bravo, Fry! Tu as tiré le gros lot.
Amy est riche,
elle a sans doute d'autres qualités...
L'argent n'a rien à voir là-dedans.
Alors comment expliques-tu que
Zoidberg soit pauvre et malheureux?
Je t'en prie!
Pour être honnête,
c'est parce qu'il est aussi très laid.
Vous allez très bien ensemble.
- J'entends les cloches d'une église?
- Hein? Non!
C'est vrai? Mince alors!
Vous avez de la chance. Je paierais
pour mettre fin à ma solitude.
Mais je suis trop pauvre
pour le faire.
Les gens paieraient pour de l'amour?
Il me vient
une idée particulièrement futée...
- 500 $ de caution.
- Il faut légaliser la prostitution!
Vas-y, paie-le!
- Chéri, on est folles de toi!
- Je sais. Ferme-la!
AGENCE MATRIMONIALE
Une agence de rencontres. Une autre
façon de faire du proxénétisme.
- Qui voudra venir dans ton agence?
- M'énerve pas ou je te cogne!
Fry? Amy? Rhabillez-vous,
j'ai besoin d'une agrafeuse!
Arrête!
Si tu interromps la parade...
le mâle va nous frapper
avec sa grosse gonade.
Ca marche.
Ils croient qu'on se tripote.
- Pourquoi on se tripote pas?
- Je sais pas.
DISCRETES ET SELECTIONNEES
- Très bien, monsieur...
- Smith. Zapp Smith. Brannigan.
Décrivez votre partenaire idéale.
Voyons... Oui... Oui, ça aussi.
Ca, ça me plaît aussi.
En fait, je vais prendre
toutes les options.
Insérons la carte dans notre détecteur
d'atomes crochus.
- Je vous présente la femme idéale.
- Enchanté.
On embrasse comme des dieux.
On pourrait aller sur Europa,
tout à l'heure.
On s'amusera à cracher sur Jupiter.
Je faisais ce genre de truc
au 20ème siècle.
C'est génial de penser
aux mêmes choses, comme ça.
Ouais. Tu sais, Fry,
j'adore être avec toi.
C'était génial. Et puis elle me dit:
"J'adore être avec toi."
Ca devient trop sérieux. Je ne suis
pas l'homme d'une seule femme.
- Ca ne durera pas, de toute façon.
- Cette fille m'étouffe.
- Salut.
- Tu vois! Elle me harcèle au boulot.
- Fry!
- Au boulot, elle est là.
A la machine à café,
elle est encore là.
Je couche avec elle,
elle est dans le lit.
- Tu exagères.
- Tu trouves? Tu trouves?!
Je suis un bon parti.
Je touche un salaire de coursier.
- Elle est milliardaire.
- Je suis son homme-objet.
Viens sur Europa avec nous.
Je veux pas qu'on soit seuls.
On le fait ce pique-nique
en amoureux?
Tu sais qui adore
les pique-niques en amoureux?
Le Dr Zoidberg.
Tu as bien parlé d'un
repas chaud gratuit?
EN PANNE
J'avais pas mangé depuis mardi.
Des œufs d'oiseaux.
Des tranches d'animaux.
De l'osier tressé.
Fini. Je peux conduire?
Non. Fry, t'es libre demain? J'ai
des places pour le combat de singes.
On passe déjà la Saint-Valentin
ensemble! Ca suffit pas?
Très bien. Tu veux faire quoi
pour la Saint-Valentin?
- On se voit pour la Saint-Valentin?
- Tu as dis...
Amy, il faut qu'on parle!
Zoidberg va conduire!
Attends... Excuse-moi.
Je vais mettre le pied au plancher.
Tu sais, même si on aime le chocolat,
on finit par s'en lasser...
quand il dit:
"J'adore être avec toi."?
- T'aimes pas le chocolat?
- Pas quand il me coupe la parole.
Le vainqueur de la course
est Hot Rod Zoidberg!
Ce que j'essaie de te dire,
c'est qu'on devrait arrêter de...
A toi de conduire.
Fry? Comment te sens-tu?
J'ai mal à la tête. Que s'est-il
passé? Quelqu'un est blessé?
Non. Bien sûr que non.
Personne à part toi.
Ton corps a été très abîmé
dans l'accident.
- Comment ca?
- Regarde.
J'ai réussi à sauver ta tête
en t'opérant tout de suite.
- Comment?
- Regarde.
Je crois qu'on n'est pas près
d'être séparés, Fry.
C'est ce qui arrive
quand un couple se forme au travail.
Ne t'inquiète pas. Ton corps
sera réparé d'ici quelques jours.
Oh! Hisse!
J'essaierai de ne pas
m'immiscer dans ta vie.
- Fry!
- Désolé. Je contrôle ce bras-là.
Que voulais-tu me dire
avant l'accident?
On devrait en parler en privé.
On se retrouve dans la réserve.
Amy, je t'aime, mais comme une amie.
Je trouve qu'on se voit trop.
- Tu veux me quitter?
- Sortons chacun de notre côté.
Je me sentais bien avec toi.
Si c'est ce que tu ressens...
Désolé, c'est le cas.
Si on ne se voit plus, je peux passer
la Saint-Valentin avec un autre?
- Sauf si ça te gêne.
- Moi aussi, je peux avoir un rencard.
J'attire toutes sortes de femmes.
Avec le corps que j'ai, tu vas attirer
une seule sorte de femme.

VOTRE CONSEILLER
Comment vont les affaires?
Tu veux voir ma collection
d'Al Gore?
Les gens sont désespérés
quand vient la Saint-Valentin.
Ouais, c'est pathétique.
- Combien?
- 500 $.
- D'accord.
- Brannigan?
- Non!
- 600 alors.
Leela? Je peux te dire un mot?
Seul à seul?
Pas de problème.
Amy va sortir avec un type
pour la Saint-Valentin...
et je serai coincé avec eux.
Tu veux bien sortir avec moi?
Pitié.
Trop tard. Je passe la Saint-Valentin
avec quelqu'un de génial.
C'est pas Brannigan.
Il ne me reste donc qu'une solution
particulièrement humiliante.
- Bender est là.
- Merci.
J'ai ce qu'il te faut. Je touche
500 $, et parce que je te connais...
je veux être payé d'avance.
C'est bon, il est bien mis.
Pourquoi tu t'es épilée? Tu attends
quoi de cette sortie, au juste?
- De quoi je me mêle?
- Et tu te maquilles beaucoup trop.
- C'est du déodorant.
- Ca sert à quoi?
Entre, Gary.
J'en ai pour 20 minutes.
Je suis pas pressé!
20 minutes? Mais tu es prête!
- C'est mieux de les faire attendre.
- Oui, elle a raison!
Chez Elzar
grande cuisine
- Cette robe te va à ravir.
- Merci.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait?
Je te trouve vraiment incroyable, Amy.
Un peu comme le rencard de Fry.
J'ai un rencard. Elle va arriver.
Fry, regarde!
C'est Petunia, la fille de tes rêves!
T'en veux plus?
Je peux l'embarquer?
- Les gamins vont adorer.
- Elle est âgée.
Elle a vu du pays.
Et je parle pas de tourisme.
- Ma caravane a perdu ses roues.
- Une rose? 5 $.
J'en prends une.
- Moi aussi.
- 8 $.
- Tu viens de dire...
- La demande monte en flèche.
Leela, je te présente
ton futur mari, Sal.
- Bel œil, Neunœuil.
- Beau cul, trou du cul.
Ca promet! Paie-lui une rose,
elle sera à tes genoux.
On peut toujours essayer.
- Santé.
- Santé.
Alors, dis-moi, tu fais des paris?
- Eh bien...
- Tu joues à quoi? Loto? Keno?
T'as même pas ton propre corps!
- Je contrôle ce bras.
- Machine à sous?
- Je peux trouver mieux.
- Attends! Reviens... chérie!
J'ai mon bus à prendre pour Nutley.
Je t'embrasse pas,
j'ai plus de dentier.
Tu m'as l'air assez tentante...
mais le bus de 22h15 pour Nutley
n'ira nulle part sans moi au volant.
Vous avez bien dit:
"22h15 pour Nutley"?
Ouais, c'est ce que j'ai dit.
T'aurais pas trouvé nos rencards
à la gare routière?
- Non!
- D'autres passagers pour Nutley?
Attends, chérie.
Et ma grosse surprise?
- Tu sais ce que j'aimerais?
- Pitié. Prenez-vous une chambre.
Peut-être plus tard.
J'ai une idée!
Si on allait manger des glaces?
J'aimerais qu'Amy vienne prendre
un café chez moi.
- J'aime pas le café.
- Moi non plus.
Je me sens un peu pompette.
Je vais régler l'addition.
Non!
Ca suffit! Je me tire!
Mais c'est ma tête préférée
sur le corps d'Amy: Fry!
- Leela!
- On allait partir.
C'est dommage. La soirée ne fait que
débuter. Gary, quel est votre métier?
Régulateur dans le milieu bancaire.
Ah oui? Il paraît que la régulation
bancaire est un mécanisme simple.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
La régulation bancaire moderne
est issue de cinq grandes traditions.
- Six même, pour être précis.
- Expliquez-moi tout.
Elle naît en 1410,
quand quelques nobles ont décidé de...
Merci.
Et voilà! Comme neuf.
Sauf pour l'aileron dorsal.
Je ne l'ai pas retrouvé
après l'accident.
- Je peux vivre sans?
- Vivre? Si on veut.
Pourquoi refuser de vous faire greffer
un canon laser sur la poitrine?
Vous pourriez anéantir vos ennemis.
On n'a pas la même vision des choses.
Merci de m'avoir promené, Amy.
Sans rancune, pour ton rencard.
Je me suis bien amusée.
Et si j'ai le cafard...
je n'aurai qu'à regarder
cette cicatrice pour penser à toi.
En tout cas, ça fait du bien
de retrouver son corps.
Alors, le cadavre? Tout va bien?
Apparemment. J'ai juste
la peau du cou un peu flasque.
Marrant... Aïe!
Merci d'être venue
à mon secours, hier soir.
Pas de problème.
J'adore être avec toi.
Ca marche, entre vous!
Tout ça grâce à Bender.
Ne me dis pas que tu as monté
de faux rencards...
pour qu'on finisse ensemble?
Tu en doutes, Leela? Tu en doutes?
C'est faux! Tu as ramassé des gens
à la gare routière pour nous arnaquer.
Exact. Mais n'est ce pas un
peu le principe de la Saint-Valentin?
- Si.
- Sans doute.
Non, pas sur le cou!
Mon derrière! Mon si joli...

Dťpartement de police, c'est rťel.
Ces gens ne sont pas des acteurs.
Ce ne sont mÍme pas des gens.
Mais je vous dis
que j'ai pas tirť au laser!
Alors d'oý vient ce trou fumant
dans votre plafond?
C'est la cinglťe du dessus qui a tirť.
Vous habitez au dernier ťtage
de ce b‚timent.
Sortez avec votre p... de camťra!
Du calme, madame.
Monsieur, posez Áa.
D'accord. Je coopŤre.
TrŤs bien.
Les mains en l'air.
Doucement.
Voilŗ...
- Et vire ce brouillage de ta figure.
- C'est pas cool!
Bender, t'avais dit
que t'ťtais dans cet ťpisode.
Non. Je suis dans Vidťo Vťritť n 3
pour le truc de la cafetiŤre.
Je suis dťsolť. Vraiment.
J'ai des problŤmes, en ce moment.
J'y vais.
Dťpartement de police
revient aprŤs la pub.
Notre mode de vie vous rend-il
nerveux et impatient?
Ta gueule, accouche!
Venez revivre les jours d'insouciance
d'antan au Passť-Rama...
- qui ressucite le vieux New York.
- C'est comme vivre en l'an 2000.
C'est l'heure de la chasse
au mammouth!
- Dansons le disco, Hammurabi.
- "Trop fort!"
Sur l'ancien site de Brooklyn.
Ca, Áa devrait te plaire.
On y va?
Si je voulais repartir,
je me congŤlerais ŗ nouveau.
Allez, Fry! J'en ai trŤs envie.
Je rÍve d'une ťpoque plus simple...
oý on ťcoutait
de la musique country...
avant que la vie soit dťvaluťe
par des machines sans cúur.
Mais Bender, tu es une...
PASSE-RAMA
C'est gťnial!
C'est comme au bon vieux temps.
Donne-moi ton portefeuille!
Prends-moi en photo
en pleine "agression."
Je prends aussi l'appareil!
Sortie
C'est chouette d'apprendre.
Le vieux Wall Street.
- Non!
- Je suis ruinť!
Remarquez
cette tablette mystťrieuse...
qui n'a pas encore ťtť dťchiffrťe.
- Tu sais, toi?
- Un flic me l'a dit.
Ca veut dire: "Dťgage."
Je passe vraiment une bonne journťe
avec vous.
Hť! Une cabine ŗ suicide!
Salut, les emmerdeurs!
Dťsolť, Bender,
c'est une cabine de tťlťphone.
- Ca servait ŗ quoi?
- A New York? De toilettes.
Je reviens tout de suite.
XLIlŤme rue
"Jetons uniquement"
Comment ca marche?
Je te montre.
C'est un tourniquet.
APPRENEZ LE FRANGLAIS
C'est quoi?
- Encore des toilettes?
- C'est un HLM mobile.
Allez, Fry, debout!

LES TRESORS
DE LA SAINTE TOMBE
La chambre funťraire du plus grand
leader spirituel du 20Ťme siŤcle...
Al Sharpton.
En voilŗ un qui avait du goŻt.
Il a ťtť momifiť
en habit de cťrťmonie.
On appelle aussi Áa un "survÍtement."
LES EMBOUTEILLAGES
Les embouteillages...
ťtaient un forum public oý
on ťchangeait des opinions.
Dťgage, raclure de cervelle!
Avance, tÍte de lard!
Tout a commencť
avec l'invention de Gerald Ford...
l'Automo-Voiture, propulsťe
par des fossiles en combustion.
Voici une chaÓne de montage
du 20Ťme siŤcle...
oý des robots primitifs
assemblaient les voitures.
On en a fait du chemin!
Le fruit du labeur de ces robots
ťtait la majestueuse Latoura de 1992.
Ma copine en avait une!
En fait, c'ťtait qu'une voisine...
mais elle fermait jamais ses rideaux.
Je t'ai dťjŗ dit de finir
tes histoires une phrase plus tŰt.
Faufilons-nous
pour la voir de plus prŤs.
On ne touche pas aux antiquitťs,
monsieur.
Pardon. Tu travailles ici. J'aurais dŻ
le voir ŗ ton accoutrement.
Ca vient de chez Miller's Outp...
Oui, c'est Áa. Je travaille ici.
Mets ce tas de rouille
derriŤre la cathťdrale Saint Koch.
Tu conduisais beaucoup, Fry?
Personne ne conduisait ŗ New York
ŗ cause des embouteillages.
Sympa!
Vous l'entendez ronronner, ce bťbť?
Y a un bťbť, lŗ-dedans?
C'est comme faire de la bicy...
- J'ai eu le coup du lapin.
- Comment Áa? Tu n'as pas de cou.
Je voulais dire le cul du lapin.
Ce choc est tombť ŗ pic.
Au moins, on est arrÍtťs.
J'ai eu le coup du lapin.
Comment va le robot?
On a fait ce qu'on a pu.
- Alors, il est...
- Comme neuf? Oui!
Leela, Zoidberg, les autres,
je vous prťsente Flexo.
A part ce bouc trŤs chic, il ressemble
ŗ Bender comme un frŤre!
Bien vu!
On est des robots tordeurs.
C'est quoi ton numťro de sťrie?
3370318.
Sans blague? Moi, c'est 2716057.
- Je pige pas.
- Ben! C'est deux fois deux cubes!
Dťsolť de t'avoir ťcrabouillť, Flexo.
Ca va mieux?
J'ai sŻrement meilleure mine que toi.
Je plaisante.
T'as trŤs bonne mine.
T'as juste une tÍte bizarre.
Ils font peut-Ítre des crŤmes.
- Non. T'es super.
- Comment je peux me faire pardonner?
En fait, ta cascade m'a esquintť
le dos. Tu peux me masser?
Bien sŻr.
C'est mieux.
Un peu plus bas.
- Comme ca?
- Plus bas.
- Bien. Encore un peu plus bas.
- Je ne peux pas descendre plus.
Dis ca ŗ mon cul!

ELLES VOUS FERONT DISJONCTER
Ne ratez pas Áa.
Six superbes machines!
Elles savent ce que vous aimez
au micron prŤs.
- Vire tes ventilos, ma poule!
- Vas-y!
Continue!
- Roule, ma poule!
- Ca c'est du roulement!
J'aime pas cet endroit.
Il fait 50 et y a pas d'oxygŤne.
Tais-toi et siffle.
- Ouais!
- Super!
Quel ch‚ssis!
Fabrication mexicaine, sŻrement!
Et c'est pas du fer blanc.
C'est du tungstŤne, et du bon.
Ouais.
Elle a un de ces carburateurs!
- Pervers.
- Hou hou...
Merci pour cette maigre somme.
Choisissez une transaction ťrotique.
Si vous dansiez
sur les genoux de mon ami?
Non.
Sans facon. Vraiment.
Il y a quelque chose chez ce Flexo
qui me dťplaÓt.
Hť, Fry! Fais gaffe!
T'as pigť? C'est du chlore!
- C'est drŰle, c'est toxique!
- Rigole, le homard!
Il craint.
Je regrette de l'avoir renversť.
Calme ta haine.
Il n'est pas pire que Bender.
Si. Il boit, il fume et
il diffuse des photos de moi ŗ poil.
- C'est tout Bender!
- Je parle de Flexo.
J'ai compris. Comme c'est mignon!
T'es jaloux du nouvel ami de Bender.
Non. C'est faux.
Ecoutez-moi bien:
Flexo est mauvais.
Il est la face obscure de Bender.
Calme ta haine!
J'ai de bonnes nouvelles! Venez dans
ma chambre pour une dťmonstration.
Tout le monde au lit avec moi.
J'ai quelque chose ŗ vous montrer.
Admirez-moi...
ceci!
Que c'est beau!
C'est ťnorme!
Je peux toucher?
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
C'est un atome de Jumbonium.
Un ťlťment si rare que son seul noyau
vaut plus de 50000 dollars.
- Combien de plus?
- 100000.
Je l'avais cachť sous mon matelas.
On peut parler de Áa ailleurs?
Mais bien sŻr!
L'atome orne ce diadŤme en toc...
qui sera offert ŗ la gagnante
de l'ťlection de Miss Univers.
Votre t‚che consiste ŗ le livrer
sain et sauf.
Quand j'ťtais une petite fille,
je rÍvais d'Ítre Miss Univers.
C'est pathťtique.
Toutes les filles rÍvent
d'Ítre Miss Univers.
- Pas moi.
- Ah bon?
Ca doit Ítre que les filles jolies.
Vu le prix de l'atome, Planet Express
ferait faillite s'il ťtait volť.
Il nous faudra donc du renfort
pour cette mission.
Monsieur! Ici, ici!
On devrait prendre
quelqu'un qu'on connaÓt.
- Flexo est bien mais...
- Flexo est bien?
Alors ca me convient.
La bienvenue ŗ bord, mon vieux.
Des bandidos de l'espace
opŤrent pas loin.
Vous prendrez des tours de garde
de 8 h.
Bender, puis Flexo, puis Fry.
Attends. Faisons ca
par ordre alphabťtique.
D'accord.
Bender, puis Flexo, puis Fry.
Alors par grades.
D'accord.
Bender, puis Flexo, puis Fry.
Flexo est plus gradť?
On dit
"Flexo est plus gradť, chef!"
- Qui va lŗ?
- Ne braque pas Áa sur moi.
Je sais que Flexo est ton ami
mais je n'ai pas confiance.
Il a une barbe
alors tu dis qu'il est mťchant?
J'ai aussi une ťtiquette pour toi,
monsieur "J'ai des prťjugťs".
- C'est faux.
- Garde Áa pour tes potes ŗ cagoule!
- Tu gardes un úil sur le coffre?
- T'as raison!
C'est mon tour. Va t'allonger
et dťconnecte un peu.
D'accord.
Vu!
Je t'ai vu regarder l'atome.
Je regarde des tas d'atomes.
- T'es pas en train de te reposer?
- T'aimerais bien que je m'endorme.
Moi, tu sais, tant que tu la fermes!
Je te charrie!
J'en ai une bien bonne:
Je vais attendre mon tour ici.
- Fais ce que tu veux.
- Compte sur moi.
- TrŤs bien!
- TrŤs bien!
TrŤs bien!
Ca fait huit heures.
Huit heures que je m'ennuie ferme.
Non. Je dťconne.
T'es un mec gťnial.
L'atome est enfin en lieu sŻr.
Election de Miss Univers
50% d'implants maximum
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
Mon Dieu!
T'as entendu des maracas?
- Non.
- C'ťtait pas des bandidos.
Boucle le vaisseau.
- Ne laisse pas filer Flexo.
- A vos ordres!
On dirait que Flexo s'est jouť
de nous tous. Surtout de moi...
Bender.
Comment a-t-il pu voler l'atome?
Avec un rayon endormeur.
Ca existe, dans le futur?
- Non.
- Alors je me suis endormi.
Tu avais raison pour Flexo.
J'ai tout bouclť,
mais il a peut-Ítre filť.
Merci, Bender.
Cherchons-le.
J'ai un plan du vaisseau avec moi.
Garde un úil sur Fry.
Ca pourrait aussi Ítre lui.
MATERIEL D'URGENCE
Je cherche...
Pourquoi tu cherches Flexo
dans mes culottes?
Il n'ťtait pas lŗ, il y a 10 mn.
J'ai prťfťrť revťrifier.
Il n'ťtait pas dans la cuisine.
Bender, tu peux me passer ce plan,
une minute?
Et rester le bec dans l'eau s'il y a
une chasse au trťsor? Pas question.
L‚che ca!
TrŤs bien. Prends-la!
On dirait que Flexo s'en est tirť.
Zut alors!
Il a dŻ sauter
juste quand on a atterri.
Ou peut-Ítre qu'il est toujours ici!
Attends. Tu es Bender.
Qui a dit le contraire?
Pourquoi cette ťcharpe, ce col roulť,
et ca?
On appelle Áa l'ťlťgance.
Renseigne-toi, ŗ l'occasion.

Dťclaration terminťe.
Quelle cybercrťature repartira
avec le diadŤme atomique?
Ne parlez pas trop du diadŤme.
Nous le saurons aprŤs ces quelques
messages subliminaux.
Vous avez perdu l'atome?
Vous n'Ítes que des moins que rien!
Vous avez une idťe de sa valeur,
bande de dťcťrťbrťs?
- 100000 $?
- 200000 $?
- 200001?
- C'est vous le plus proche.
On y va.
Signez le reÁu pour l'atome.
Je ne signe rien du tout.
Retrouvez-moi ce diadŤme.
- Mais M. Barker...
- Ca suffit!
J'ai beau Ítre contre la fourrure,
je suis prÍt ŗ vous dťpecer!
Tant qu'on fait pas de manteau avec.
Messieurs,

C'est rťservť aux femmes!
TrŤs bien. Ca suffit!
Voilŗ l'atome!
Bender? Tu as volť l'atome?
Je peux vous expliquer:
Ca coŻte trŤs cher.
Je l'ai vu le voler quand Fry dormait.
Je suis venu prťvenir Bob Barker.
Attends un peu.
Bender est le cŰtť obscur de Bender?
Je suis choquť! Choquť!
Peut-Ítre pas tant que Áa.
Dťsolťe de t'avoir soupÁonnť, Flexo.

Vous me rendez malade!

Vous pouvez aller vous faire voir!

Vous Ítes sympas.

C'est aujourd'hui qu'Hermes
rentre de vacances.
- Bonjour!
- Salut, Hermes!
- Yo!
- Mon pote!
- Alors, comment c'était?
- On est allés voir les Bouffe-tętes.
Hermes a tellement aimé
qu'il y est resté.
Hermes a dű s'éclater.
Il a un Bouffe-tęte sur sa tęte!
- Tu vas nous faire contaminer!
- Fais comme si de rien n'était!
Votre mission: Aller sur la plančte

- Pour quoi faire?
- S'y balader sans porter de casque.
C'est super, Hermes!
Tout ce que tu voudras!
- On le plante et on file au ciné!
- Ouais, super idée!
Je vais voir un film

Si vous voulez que Calculon fasse

Si vous voulez que Calculon revérifie

- Vous avez appuyé sur 2.
- Non!
J'en suis quasiment certain.
Ajouter le report du formulaire 16-A,

Excusez-moi monsieur,
mais vous frappez mon sičge.
"Excusez-moi monsieur,
mais vous..."
C'est en gros ce que j'ai dit.
Pourriez-vous arręter?
Bien sűr, mon pote!
Monsieur?
- Qui a lancé ca?
- Assez!
Monsieur, je vous défie aux poings!
Je suis foutu!
Allons nous réfugier
dans l'entrée!
Vous avez mérité
une bonne correction!
Tu sais qui c'était?
L'UNITE MASQUEE
J'y crois pas! Vous lui avez mis
une sacrée dérouillée!
Impressionnant!
Je suis l'organisateur
du Catch Robotique.
Je m'y connais en racaille qui cherche
la baston au ciné. Vous ętes un pro!
- Vous m'avez pas vu aux enterrements.
- Je vous veux dans la Ligue.
Le Catch Robotique...
ca a l'air bien. D'accord!
Mon héros!
On n'en fait plus des films comme ça!
Je vais ętre le plus grand
robot catcheur!
Je serai une terreur,
plus rapide que l'éclair!
Tu vas pas faire du catch robotique.
C'est le sport le plus brutal!
- Ah bon?
- Il n'y a pas de rčgles.
Deux robots entrent,
un seul part.
Puis l'autre s'en va
aprčs avoir été déclaré vainqueur.
- C'est pas si méchant que ça!
- Ai-je mentionné les tortures?
Il me semblait, pourtant.
Oui, j'en suis sűr.
Des tortures? Je ne suis pas assuré
pour ça. Je laisse tomber!
Non, tu dois le faire.
Je me fiche que ce soit suicidaire.
Pourquoi quand c'est moi,
t'es pas d'accord?
C'est plus important que le concours
du plus gros mangeur de billes.
- Je vais vous raconter une histoire.
- Encore celle de l'orphelinarium!
Petite ŕ l'orphelinarium,
on se moquait de moi.
Je trouvais refuge
dans le Kung Fu Octunien.
Excellent! Bill, Keith,
vous participerez aux championnats.
Bill, félicite Keith
quand il reprend conscience.
Mais je peux battre ces crétins
l'śil fermé!
Oui, mais il y a plus important
que de gagner.
- Il te manque l'esprit du guerrier.
- Comment ça? Regardez!
Aucune fille ne l'a.
Tu as l'esprit de la femme au foyer.
- Ou au mieux, de l'institutrice.
- Assez, venez vous battre!
Mais moi, j'ai l'esprit du guerrier.
Alors, le combat est déjŕ fini.
Le vainqueur?
Moi!
Revanche? T'as encore perdu!
C'est bon? T'as eu ton compte!
J'ai perdu ma chance d'ętre
championne, mais toi non!
Elle a raison. Je veux pas ętre
un raté comme elle!
En fait, je suis partant!
Voyons ce que tu vaux.
Touche tes orteils.
J'y arrive toujours pas!
Que le combat démarre!
ANTI-ROUILLE
Mesdames et messieurs
et les Smizmars!
Bienvenue au combat de ce soir!
Dans ce coin, il nous vient tout droit
de l'Amérique profonde: Le Mexique.
Voici Bender!
APPLAUDISSEZ
Et dans l'autre coin,
fait de pičces douteuses:
Le Trancheur tranchant!
ALLEZ BENDER!
- Tu vas l'avoir!
- Voici le chapeau de fan de Bender.
Merci, Hermes!
Garde ton truc!
Tu ne peux pas frapper
ce que tu ne vois pas!
Lčve-toi! Tu vas pas abandonner
chaque fois que tu reçois une hache!
Ou une perceuse! Arręte
de te gratter et retournes-y!
Et le vainqueur est...
Bender!
- T'as cartonné, fiston!
- Il est mort, je crois. Je l'ai tué!
Bonsoir, patron!
Bravo, vieux!
Il est pas mort!
C'est quoi ce délire?
On t'a pas mis au parfum?
Le Catch Robotique, c'est truqué!
C'est un secret mais c'est toujours
le robot le plus populaire qui gagne.
Je suis pas un champion?
J'ai gagné car je suis populaire?
- T'as pigé!
- Hourra, je suis populaire!
Męme pire!
Tout le monde se reconnaît en toi!
Vive Bender! Vive Bender!
Vive Bender!
A ma droite, Bender...
L'Agresseur!
Je ne suis qu'un ex-taulard qui veut
filer droit pour revoir mes gamins.
Opposé au...
Robot Milliardaire!
TRES PAUVRE
Opposé ŕ...
l'Etranger!
Je ne suis pas d'ici!
J'ai mes propres coutumes!
Regardez mon passeport bizarre!
Opposé au...
Fumeur Fou!
Moi, j'adore fumer.
Quand j'aurai gagné...
j'irai tout droit
dans votre restaurant préféré!
Vous savez, je suis aussi une machine
ŕ faire l'amour!
Tu as 3 heures de retard.
Tu vas pas tout arręter,
on a tant bossé!
- Comment ca "nous"?
- J'ai dit "on".
Bender L'Agresseur n'a pas besoin
de toi ni de quiconque!
- Et nous M. L'Agresseur?
- Les gonzesses, c'est différent!
LIGUE DU CATCH ROBOTIQUE
A LOUER ROBOT GEANT
PEQUENAUD
Salut patron! Je pourrais catcher
ces deux poupées dans la boue, non?
En fait, j'ai d'autres projets.
Et si je les combattais d'une façon
peu conventionnelle?
Ta popularité baisse.
Les ventes des savons parfumés
Bender ont chuté de 20%!
Les idiots! J'ai dit melaleuca,
pas bois de santal!
Tu vas m'écouter oů je te fais virer
de la Ligue!
- Tu perdras ŕ ton prochain match.
- Mais le public m'aime!
On verra s'il apprécie
ta nouvelle personnalité:
- Androgynator!
- Le moins populaire...
depuis Sergent Sanibroyeur!
Ah, oui? Et si l'autre type
ne gagnait pas?
Alors, le combat se terminera
ŕ la mort de l'un d'entre vous!
Melissa, faites entrer le petit!
Je suis Destructor.
On se verra sur le ring!
Je lui ai dit:
"On se verra sur le ring." Voilŕ!
Je croyais que le catch robotique,
c'était pas du bidon!
Mais c'est truqué comme la boxe!
C'est une chose de gagner
un combat arrangé. Mais perdre?
Avec cette horreur?
Je peux pas. Tu dois m'entraîner,
je dois gagner.
Quand t'en avais pas besoin,
t'as refusé que je t'aide...
alors, pourquoi je t'aiderais?
- Mais que dites-vous?
- J'en sais rien, mais je l'aide pas.
Vous avez aimé
Bender l'Agresseur!
Vous haďrez celui qui porte
atteinte aux bonnes mśurs.
Voici la nouvelle incarnation
de Bender: Androgynator!
Je suis un vrai balčze!
Dimanche, il affrontera Destructor!
Je vais te massacrer!
Et arręte de m'appeler!
Je suis son entraîneur:
Maître Fnog.
Mon élčve sera vainqueur
car il possčde l'esprit d'un guerrier.
Non, pas Fnog!
Viens, je vais t'apprendre
ŕ te battre comme une fille!
Je vais enfiler mon tutu!
DESTRUCTOR CONTRE
ANDROG YNATOR
"INTERDICTION" DE PARIER
Bonsoir et bienvenue ŕ un combat
qui va ętre remarquable.
Destructor, un robot blindé
de combat...
utilisé lors des batailles
et spécialiste des crimes de guerre...
opposé ŕ Androgynator
qui porte un tutu rose.
Ici, Rich Little imitant la voix
de Howard Cosell, au bord du ring...
avec George Foreman.
Votre avis sur l'issu de ce combat?
Ca pourrait ętre le combat
le plus inéquitable depuis 1973...
quand Ali a affronté un Joe Frazier
robotisé de 25 m.
Ma mémoire n'est plus bonne,
mais la Terre fut détruite, je crois.
Trčs intéressant.
La côte ŕ Vegas ce soir
est sans précédent: 1000 contre 0.
Une mise de $ 0 sur Bender
rapporterait $ 1000...
s'il l'emportait. Malgré cela,
peu ont couru le risque.
Ca vaut pas le coup!
Tu es censé faire des cabrioles
et le chatouiller avec cette baguette.
Au lieu de ça, tu iras
lui casser la tęte.
Pigé! Un bon coup
et pas de chatouilles!
- Je suis libéré de ce cauchemar!
- Désolé. Tiens!
Merci.
C'était froid par terre.
- Professeur, tenez un programme!
- Oh oui!
Laissez-moi mettre mes lunettes
pour lire.
Alors ça, Zoďdberg!
C'est une chouette photo de vous!
Dans ce coin, le jeune robot perturbé
aux boucles blondes...
affichant 238 kg...
Androgynator!
Fichez-moi ce hippy hors d'ici!
Et dans les deux autres coins...
affichant 400 tonnes...
l'exterminateur de Pismo... Beach!
Destructor!
Tiens, une fille qui croit ętre
une boxeuse entraîne un boxeur...
- qui croit ętre une fille.
- Vous rirez moins tout ŕ l'heure!
- Pręt?
- Je suis pręt, sonnez la cloche!
T'as pas entendu un bruit?
Embarquement immédiat
pour le vol 406...
vol direct vers la dérouille
de ta vie!
Les passagers sur la liste d'attente
sont priés...
Voici le moment de vous présenter
mon nouveau grill.
Le concept est breveté: La graisse
coule directement dans ma bouche.
Fry! Je jette l'éponge!
Pour l'amour de Dieu, Fry!
C'est exactement ce que je pensais.
- Maman!
- Fnog, ça suffit. Rappelez-le!
Fnog?
Pourquoi personne ne vient m'aider?
On se retrouve une fois de plus.
Vous manipulez Destructor
tel une marionnette.
Tricher ŕ un combat truqué,
c'est nul!
C'est mieux que d'ętre une fille
comme toi!
C'est vrai! Les filles
n'ont pas l'esprit du guerrier.
La vengeance a sonné pour Bender!
Prends ca! Et ca!
Tu étais une excellente élčve.
Dommage, j'étais un mauvais maître.
Tu n'as pas bien compris le concept
de la vengeance de Bender.
Je vais t'envoyer en enfer
chez les filles! Dommage!
Ouais!
Ouais!
Et le vainqueur est:
Destructor!
Je n'avais jamais vu
un tel spectacle...
de toute ma carričre d'imitateur
de commentateur.
Ceci étant, en tant que tęte sans
corps, j'aimerais mieux ętre mort.
Sans commentaire!
Il paraît qu'il y en a eu
un d'aplati!
Fry, oů es ton Bouffe-tęte?
Pauvre créature, morte de faim!
Je suis fičre de toi!
Pas de doute, tu as perdu.
Mais moi, j'ai eu le dessus
sur quelqu'un qui m'avait offensée.
Je souffre terriblement!
Bien joué! Quand tu as perdu,
ca avait l'air si vrai!
Voici une réduction de 10%
chez Bains et Bulles!
Je suis le plus grand!
Le plus grand!
Ainsi se termine la chronique...
d'un des grands de ce sport.
- Et il était pas mal dans son tutu!
- Il l'était sűrement!
Quoi?

LE MARIAGE DE LEELA
Bonne nouvelle!
Il y a des années, j'ai voulu me
connecter à AOL. Ca vient de marcher!
On est en ligne!
Enfilez ces Combinaisons Internet.
Je les ai concues et testées moi-même.
Ca sent le singe de labo brûlé.
J'imagine qu'au bout d'un moment,
on ne sent plus rien. Allez-y!
Attention les yeux! Internet!
Mon Dieu! C'est plein de pubs!
Suivez-moi!
C'est immense!
On y trouve
toutes les informations qu'on veut.
En effet!
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
LA MAISON CLOSE DES SARDINES
QUATRE PROSTITUEES
JOUENT AU BRIDGE
OBSEDE DE LA PINCE
AMY WONG NUE
- C'est moi!
- Mais non.
J'ai mis une photo de ton visage
sur le corps de quelqu'un d'autre.
FORUMS DE DISCUSSION
POUR ADULTES
Plus de 18 ans?
Il y a des forums pour
tous les goûts. Et voilà!
C'est dégoûtant!
Moi, je vais dans l'autre.
FORUM PERVERS
NOUVEAU... OUVRIR... FERMER...
DEGUISEMENTS...
INFIRMIERE SEXY...
Je suis une infirmière coquine.
J'ai besoin de parler à quelqu'un.
9,95 $ la minute.
Ca fait 1 $ de coquinerie de plus
que la plupart.
T'aimes l'équipe des Knicks?
Pas une fille à l'horizon?
Raboulez les poulettes
parce que je suis un chaud lapin!
- Nous aussi!
- Je suis une femme.
Allons droit au but:
Je suis une Cyclope...
capitaine de vaisseau,
la dernière de mon espèce...
et j'aimerais
rencontrer un homme.
Une femme? J'ai peur!
Grâce à Internet,
je suis lassé de sexe.
Y a-t-il un site
pour apaiser ma soif de violence?
Tu l'as dit Bouffi!
On va s'amuser!
Aujourd'hui, on fait des jeux
entièrement sur vidéo.
On appelle ça les jeux vidéo.
Jeux vidéo?
Eh ben!
Les hommes du futur vont devoir
me montrer comment ca marche.
Le doc mène le jeu!
Le doc perd le jeu.
Déconnectez-vous. On a une livraison
à faire, et j'ai besoin du téléphone.
Leela, dis aux autres de...
Qui êtes-vous?
Je vous ai vue au forum,
mais vous êtes partie trop tôt.
Après toutes ces années passées
à chercher un autre Cyclope.
J'ai rêvé de cet instant
toute ma vie!
Peut-être que vous et moi...
Idiot! Depuis qu'on m'a abandonnée
sur Terre...
j'ai voulu connaître
mon peuple et ma planète.
Je rencontre un Cyclope,
et tu le dégommes.
Je ne saurai jamais qui je suis!
Je suis désolé.
Si je peux faire quelque chose...
Je t'ai eue!
J'ai gagné! Je suis le meilleur!
Allez, on a du boulot.
Tu m'en veux toujours
d'avoir détruit ta seule chance...
de découvrir tes origines?
Non, ravie de ta victoire.
Apportons ce pop-corn indispensable
aux habitants de Cineplex 14, d'accord?
Leela, vous avez du courrier!
Ce n 'est pas de la pub!
- C'est lui!
- Pour Leela.
Objet: Bonjour.
Je suis Alcazar. J'ai pu noté
ton pseudo avant l'attaque du crétin.
Bien fait.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Rejoins-moi sur ta planète natale.
Ci-joint, un plan.
Dommage qu'il y ait
cette livraison urgente de pop-corn.
Il arrivera tout seul.
POP-CORN QUALITE CINEMA
ne convient pas aux animaux
Après des années de recherche,
j'ai peut-être trouvé ma planète.
Dommage que ce soit un dépotoir.
Regardez, la statue n'a qu'un œil!
- Sculpteur paresseux.
- Bienvenue, Leela.
Alcazar?
Etes-vous réel,
ou est-ce que je vois simple?
Je suis bien réel.
J'ai enfin trouvé
quelqu'un à un œil...
qui ne soit pas
un menuisier maladroit.
Ca va aller.
Vous ne serez plus jamais seule.
Venez, je vais vous présenter
à vous-même.
- Vos serviteurs peuvent marcher?
- Bien sûr.
On est les derniers Cyclopes.
Notre planète est Cyclopia.
Capitale: Cyclope City.
Dites-moi si je vais trop vite.
Tant d'informations... Pourtant,
j'ai l'impression de tout connaître.
Cette mosaïque sacrée
représente notre déesse de la beauté.
On la voit de derrière?
Vous avez le même œil parfait.
Notre peuple vous aurait sacrée
prêtresse ou top modèle.
Oh, voyons. Vraiment?
Le pirate Barbe-Rose,
redouté des 6 continents.
Et derrière la colline?
C'est la Vallée Interdite.
Nul ne doit y pénétrer.
C'est un cimetière?
Parce que je dois pisser.
Fry, c'est une offense à notre peuple.
N'est-ce pas?
Voilà mon chez-moi.
J'espère que mon château géant
n'est pas un problème.
Au contraire,
cela m'impressionne beaucoup.
Je vais devoir faire de la place!
Ici, je rêve tout seul
et je cuisine modestement.
C'est si triste.
Qu'est-il advenu de notre peuple?
C'est trop pénible d'en parler.
Allons voir vos chambres.
Je vous ai entendu. Qu'y a-t-il?
Rien... C'est juste que...
Je ne veux pas de larme
dans cet œil parfait.
Si ca concerne le sort de notre
peuple, ça m'intéresse beaucoup.
D'accord. Mais vous allez avoir froid
avec ces larmes.
Allons dans ma chambre.
Il n 'y a pas si longtemps, notre
peuple était heureux et prospère.
Les Taupes Aveugles devinrent jalouses
de nos prouesses visuelles.
Elles tirèrent des missiles partout
pour être sûres d'atteindre Cyclopia.
Malheureusement, une des 40 planètes
touchées fut la nôtre.
- A quelle distance?
- Un trilliard de km?
Ca a chauffé. D'ailleurs,
vous avez chaud. Otez votre veste.
Nous n'aimons pas la chaleur.
Juste avant l'impact...
nos meilleurs scientifiques
sauvèrent un bébé.
Alcazar, j'ai été bébé.
Ca pourrait être moi!
J'étais nettoyeur de piscines.
Après avoir repêché un opossum,
j'ai réalisé qu'il ne restait que moi.
Quelle tragédie.
La vraie tragédie,
c'est que notre race va s'éteindre.
- Peut-être pas.
- Comment ca?
Vous êtes un mâle,
je suis une femelle.
Je ne vous suis toujours pas.
Réveille-toi, mon roi.
Sacrée nuit.
Fais-moi un café, tu veux?
- Bien sûr. Autre chose?
- Crêpes et saucisses.
La cuisine est à la cave.
Après, on pourra peut-être parler
de notre future civilisation.
Super crêpes.
Pratique pour boucher
de minuscules bouches d'égouts.
On ne veut pas avoir l'air de ploucs,
n'est-ce pas?
Alors fais la vaisselle, et classe
mes photos de célébrités nues.
- Alcazar...
- Appelle-moi Al.
Je sais que tu as longtemps vécu
tout seul. Et je compatis.
Mais je ne suis pas
ta servante.
Tu as raison. Je suis désolé.
Ca ne marchera jamais.
Dommage pour la race des Cyclopes.
D'accord, je vais faire la vaisselle.
Où sont les assiettes?
C'est le rêve de toutes les femmes:
Vénérer un crétin de première.
Crétin, peut-être, mais il est louche.
Il cache quelque chose.
Et je vais le découvrir.
VALLEE INTERDITE
NE PAS ENTRER
MEME POUR RECUPERER UN BALLON
Personne ne m'arrêtera!
Al?
Je me suis coiffée comme tu voulais.
- Qui sont ces gens?
- Des amis.
Où as-tu trouvé ce canapé,
la télé, et tout le reste?
Des gens les avaient laissés
au coin de la rue. Comme toi, Leela.
Dommage qu'ils n'aient pas laissé
ce qu'il te fallait:
Dentifrice, dépilatoire pour dos,
et slips anti-taches.
Bien envoyé!
Fry est dans le cachot.
Nourris-le. S'il meurt, ça va puer.
Fais donc sortir le petit.
Deux fois dans la même journée?
Je ne suis pas Superman!
Pourquoi es-tu allé
dans la Vallée?
Alcazar cache quelque chose.
Tu ne vas pas aimer
ce que je vais te dire:
Al est un con.
Il n'est pas pour toi.
- Je sais.
- C'est vrai?
Si ça paraît évident à ton cerveau
mal formé, c'est limpide pour moi!
Il est crade et me traite en esclave.
Largue le borgne!
Impossible. Si je le quitte,
c'est la fin de notre race.
Tant pis si ça veut dire
que je serai malheureuse toute ma vie.
Leela? Coup de serpillière
dans l'allée numéro deux.
- Je le largue au dîner.
- J'y serai.
Leela, le porc trouve ta pâtée infâme.
Ouais, c'est infâme!
Tu mérites mieux que ce type.
Largue-le.
J'essaie.
Un peu d'attention,
rabattez vos caquets.
Avant, je passais mes soirées à mater
des films avec le rat et sa copine.
Et une belle femme est arrivée.
Arrête de manger!
Elle m'a redonné espoir
quant à notre civilisation.
Le destin de générations de Cyclopes
dépend de la réponse à cette question.
Leela, veux-tu m'épouser?
Non! Non!
Oui, je le veux!
Eux, ils se marient.
- Félicitations, Leela.
- C'est génial!
- Contente de vous voir.
- C'est magique!
Bienvenue!
BEUVERIE D'AVANT MARIAGE
Fais-moi sortir d'ici!
C'est horrible de manger des restes.
Je fais mes besoins partout,
comme un animal.
- Les animaux font dans les coins.
- J'aurais dû y penser.
J'aimerais t'aider, mais c'est
mon mariage, et je suis occupée.
Tiens, et sois heureux.
Au moins l'un de nous le sera.
Et voilà! Le petit oiseau va sortir.
On doit salir la réputation d'Alcazar.
Allons voir ce que cache
la Vallée Interdite.
Non merci, ça va.
Tu pourras voler des trucs interdits.
Pour la première fois dans ma vie,
je sens que j'ai volé assez de trucs.
Bender, reprends-toi!
Désolé, je ne sais pas
ce qui m'a pris. Allons-y.
J'adore voler
J'adore piquer des trucs
Le porc a les mêmes sandales que moi.
Allez, saute!
C'est bien!
Holà, Cocotte.
Mon Dieu!
Quatre châteaux identiques!
Chacun plus identique
que le précédent.
Bizarre. Un autre Cyclope,
mais celui-ci a 5 yeux.
Et celle-ci n'en a aucun.
Quelqu'un a-t-il une raison
d'empêcher ce couple...
de s'unir dans les liens irrévocables
du bonheur sacré?
Sauver la race des monstres à un œil?
Qui pourrait s'y opposer?
Abrège.
Prenez-vous... meilleur... pire...
mort vous sépare?
Je le veux. Plus vite!
Leela, faites-vous un copier-coller
de sa réponse?
Je...
Oh, mon Dieu!
Alcazar,
tu as oublié d'inviter quelqu'un.
Pourquoi es-tu en retard à notre
mariage? Où sont passés tes yeux?
Salut chérie.
Retourne au château et attends-moi.
Je me suis transformé en alien
à 5 yeux, et j'ai promis de l'épouser.
Mais en vérité je suis un Cyclope,
et je vais t'épouser.
Ah oui? Et elle, alors?
- C'est embarrassant.
- Qui est-elle?
- Qui sont-elles?
- Retourne au château.
Que dites-vous de celle-ci?
Et de celle-là?
Leela,
ça doit te paraître très confus.
Un peu. C'est pourquoi je vais te
faire mal en attendant l'explication.
Montre-toi tel que tu es réellement.
Allez!
Voilà ma véritable forme. Je peux
tout expliquer. On a tous des besoins.
J'avais besoin de 5 aliens
pour astiquer mes 5 châteaux.
Je me suis fait un peu de blé:
Le porc matait
derrière un miroir sans teint.
N'importe lequel d'entre vous
aurait fait la même chose, non?
C'est un saint!
Pourquoi 5 mariages
dans la même journée?
C'est cher,
les smokings qui changent de forme.
- Une dernière question.
- Laquelle?
Tant qu'à changer de forme, pourquoi
ne pas avoir changé l'essentiel?
- Merci de m'avoir sauvée de ce taré.
- A ton service.
Je voulais tant savoir qui j'étais,
que j'en ai oublié qui j'étais.
T'inquiète, tu as des décennies
pour me rembourser...
le pop-corn que tu as détruit...
et pour trouver ta véritable maison.
Il n'y a pas tant de planètes que ça.

L'INSPECTRICE DE
L'ADMINISTRATION CENTRALE
Bureaucrate, niveau 36
Le dernier formulaire de la journée!
Bienvenue à Tampon Ville.
Population: 5.
J'ajoute la touche finale!
Ah, le cycle de la bureaucratie!
Nom d'un chien jamaïcain! Une lettre
de l'administration centrale!
Hermes Conrad, vous allez recevoir
une lettre de l'administration centrale.
Ca vient
de l'administration centrale!
Je joue au poker ce soir,
avec mes anciens collègues.
Ca vous dit?
Je ne joue qu'avec des crétins.
- Je viens.
- Moi aussi!
Leela. Fry. Robot.
Quels que soient vos plans,
je suis libre.
On fait un poker. Attention,
mes amis ne sont pas débutants.
La belle affaire!
Je dis: "Laissons les dés décider".
- Tu jubiles. Quelqu'un est viré?
- Mieux.
L'administration centrale
m'envoie un inspecteur demain.
Je vais enfin accéder au niveau 35.
Le 35ème plus haut niveau qui existe.
On fait une partie de poker.
Viens et amène un de tes fameux plats.
Désolé, mais j'ai rangé
toute la journée.
Je vais aller me reposer à la manière
jamaïcaine: Du lait et un gros dodo.
Jamaïcain? Je croyais que t'étais
un gros lézard venu de l'espace.
Ca doit être mon ancien patron.
- Bonjour, vous êtes virée.
- Je sais.
Désolé, mais vous avez plus
d'un an de retard.
Que les jeux commencent!
J'ai dit à Leela: "Je suis flatté
par votre invitation, mais c'est non."
Les liaisons entre collègues
ne marchent jamais.
C'est ainsi que j'ai rencontré
mon horrible femme.
Vous n'avez jamais porté d'alliance.
J'ignorais.
Ma femme ignore que je bosse. Il y a
vie privée et vie professionnelle.
Misez! Vous aurez le temps de parler
quand vous serez pauvres.
- C'est quoi?
- Mes lunettes porte-bonheur.
Je les ai piquées à un mec quand
il est allé se vidanger aux toilettes.
Je ne peux rien écrire
avec ces cartes.
Enfin, j'ai une belle pince!
Trois femelles, un numéro
et un roi qui se fait une lobotomie.
Peu importe le nombre de femelles,
Bender a la chance pour lui.
Que voulez-vous?
Ca doit être mes lunettes.
Rien. Rien. Que dalle. Que dalle.
Lamentable.
Regardez ça et mordez-vous les doigts.
C'était l'argent pour nourrir
mes enfants!
Je suis fauché.
Que vais-je dire à ma femme?
Inquiétez-vous plutôt du ver
qui rampe dans votre intestin.
Faites voir un peu ces lunettes!
Oh, mes dieux!
Des lunettes à rayons X!
C'est sur ordre du médecin.
J'en ai besoin pour lire des trucs.
- Au travers des trucs.
- Tricheur!
Brisez-lui le cou!
Ne lui faites pas de mal!
C'est mon meilleur ami.
Vous n'oseriez pas frapper un homme
avec des lunettes à rayons X?
M'arrachez pas le bras!
Aïe, mes fesses!
FERME
OUVERT BIENTOT
OUVERT
Nom d'une vache russe!
C'était des fantômes! Des gros!
Et un cyclone!
Je ne réussirai jamais l'inspection.
Je vais me retrouver plus bas
qu'une barre de limbo au carnaval.
Et ce jour-là, elles rasent le sol!
On veillera à ce que tu nettoies.
C'est trop tard.
L'inspecteur sera là dans une seconde.
- Qui êtes-vous?
- Morgan Proctor, niveau 19.
Hermes Conrad, niveau 36.
- Assez discuté. Commencons.
- Par ici, s'il vous plaît.
Tu es d'un calme impressionnant!
C'est parce que j'ai un plan.
Je vais sauter!
Fais une pirouette!
Fais pas ça!
Tu as encore plein de choses à vivre!
Mensonge thérapeutique, hein?
Ne saute pas! Choisis une méthode
qui n'abîmera pas ton foie.
Il peut servir à quelqu'un d'autre.
Chéri, non!
Va-t'en! Je n'étais pas fait
pour être bureaucrate!
Je ne suis désagréable
que 78,36% du temps.
Je suis pas digne de tamponner. Alors
je tamponnerai le sol de mon corps!
Si vous exécutez votre décès
sans remplir une demande de suicide...
et/ou de chute, vous serez rétrogradé
à titre posthume.
Vivre ou mourir.
Quoi que je choisisse,
je me retrouverai enfermé.
Nom d'un je-ne-sais-quoi
de je-ne-sais-où!
Je vous relève de vos fonctions.
Considérez-vous en congés payés.
C'est la pire des punitions!
Je te recommande une thalasso
sur Spa 5, la planète sauna. Regarde.
Spa 5? C'est bien?
C'est merveilleux.
Je ne connais pas...
mais je reçois des crevettes
quand j'envoie des patients.
Je dois nommer un bureaucrate
pour le remplacer.
Je me nomme moi. J'accepte.
Bienvenue.
C'est réglé. Hermes va se reposer
et Zoidberg va manger.
J'ai regardé vos rapports. Pourquoi
la livraison de lundi a pris du retard?
- Fry avait la tête dans un cratère.
- J'ai cru que ça rentrerait.
- Que faisiez-vous pendant ce temps?
- Je buvais des Martinis.
- Jusqu'à ce qu'on manque d'olives.
- Je peux tout expliquer.
Vous avez osé embarquer
sans faire le plein d'olives?
- On se croirait au lycée.
- Contrôle des casiers!
La veste n'est pas
dans l'ordre alphabétique!
- Quoi?
- La fermeture doit être descendue.
Parfois, on se sent seul.
Je n'ai jamais vu
une chose pareille!
- Pourquoi ce yaourt?
- C'est simple...
c'est du lait qui a tourné.
Le temps m'a joué un tour.
Rompez!
Fry, je voudrais vous parler en privé.
PORTE OUVERTE
PIECE SECURISEE
C'est le casier de l'autre Fry.
Moi, c'est "Phry".
Admettez-le, Fry.
Vous êtes un dégoûtant.
Un gros vilain dégoûtant.
Gros dégoûtant! Gros dégoûtant!
Je croyais que vous n'aimiez pas
ce qui était dégoûtant?
Je suis cernée de maniaques
de la propreté.
Il n'y a rien de plus excitant
qu'un cochon.
Je vous en prie.
Personne ne doit savoir pour nous deux.
Si on me demande, je nierai tout.
Comme toutes mes ex-copines.
CAMP DE REMISE EN FORME
Et deux, et trois, et quatre.
Travaillez-moi ces bras!
C'est un camp de travaux forcés!
A cause de Zoidberg. Si je sors d'ici,
j'en ferai de la pâtée pour chat!
Je suis avec toi!
Je sais pas pourquoi je le consulte.
La prochaine fois,
je vous raterai pas.
Pour ces 6 raisons et demie...
- je nomme Leela au rang de copilote.
- Derrière qui?
- Le pilote automatique.
- Ce poivrot?
Bender, vous êtes chargé de surveiller
les fonctions vitales du professeur.
C'est du plein temps!
Fry, je vous nomme
directeur des livraisons.
Vous ne livrerez plus,
et aurez un bureau à côté du mien.
Nickel!
Voulez-vous lui taper dans la main
qu'on puisse continuer?
Il faut le faire deux fois.
La séance est levée.
BUREAU DE M. FRY
LE PLACARD A ETE DEPLACE
Pourquoi est-elle si gentille
avec toi?
C'est un monstre.
Elle m'a grondé et frappé.
Elle risque de perdre mon amitié.
Que t'est-il arrivé?
J'ai raccompagné le professeur.
On était dans le parc...
et une dame m'a accusé
d'avoir volé son sac.
Pour m'en défaire, j'ai dû la frapper
avec un sac que j'avais trouvé.
C'est de la faute de Morgan,
ce rond-de-cuir à la noix!
Si elle était là, je...
- Elle est derrière?
- Non. Je suis devant vous.
Morgan? Il est 3h du matin!
Une bête a renversé ma poubelle,
et ça m'a fait penser à vous.
Mon Dieu! C'est si...
répugnant.
Alors, c'est là que vous mangez?
Que je mange et que je dors.
Bender est mon colocataire.
Il pourrait rentrer.
Non. Je lui ai dit de curer
les oreilles du professeur.
Fry? Je t'ai fait une bougie avec...
Quoi!
Je comprends mieux maintenant.
Tout devient clair.
Clair comme de l'eau de roche.
Le bureau, la promotion, le nain
de mon club qui me pique mes opinions.
Tout s'explique!
Je dois reconnaître
que ça m'a ouvert les yeux!
Encore une affaire résolue,
mon cher Watson.
Revenez! Son disque dur est rayé!
J'étais aveugle,
et, à présent, j'y vois.
J'ai découvert le pot aux roses!
M. Bender, à propos d'hier,
on s'est mal compris.
Vous n'avez pas compris? Je vais vous
expliquer. Vous couchiez ensemble!
Non. Un bureaucrate de mon niveau
ne fraternise pas.
C'est ce qui donne tout son piment
à l'histoire. C'est le fruit défendu.
Je dirai: "Devinez qui a vu Fry
et Morgan en pleine action!"
Ils diront: "Qui ca?"
Et je dirai:
"C'est ce vieux Bender..."
Qu'avez-vous fait?
J'ai retiré son cerveau.
Tout ce qu'est Bender est ici.
Son esprit, sa mémoire,
son interface pugnace.
Je suis Bender.
Veuillez insérer disquette.
Bender a besoin d'un cerveau,
sinon il ne sert à rien!
Qu'avez-vous fait?
Ne touchez à rien!
J'ai tout envoyé
à l'administration centrale.
J'ai fait mon devoir.
C'était un mauvais robot.
Non, c'était un mauvais ami.
Je veux le récupérer!
Vous auriez dû en faire la demande,
il y a 20 ans.
J'en ai marre de vous
et de l'administration!
Gros dégoûtant! Gros dégoûtant!
Vous aviez une liaison?
Elle est tombée amoureuse
de mon côté dégoûtant.
Et je l'ai aimée
car je suis désespéré.
Je suis Bender.
Veuillez insérer disquette.
Sans son cerveau,
Bender est calme et serviable.
Il faut qu'on récupère
cette disquette!
- Oui. Bonne idée!
- Ouais!
Pourquoi?
On n'a pas besoin de raison
pour y aller.
Tu ne pourras pas rentrer comme ça.
C'est un nid de paperasse
et de règles à suivre.
Un de mes amis est devenu fou
en cherchant les toilettes!
Alors on aura besoin d'un guide.
J'y suis déjà allé plein de fois!
Les chariots partent pleins,
et reviennent vides.
C'est inefficace!
Tais-toi! C'est le seul moyen
qu'on ait de se reposer.
Ce serait plus efficace de 4%...
s'ils utilisaient les vides
pour transporter le matériel.
Tu sais que t'as de bonnes idées.
C'est pas vrai!
Tu sais quoi,
tu devrais être bureaucrate.
ADMINISTRATION CENTRALE
Licence en cours
- Ca va être long?
- J'attends mon acte de naissance.
Je n'aurai pas le temps d'arriver
jusqu'au bout. Bonne chance.
Laissez-moi là où je m'écroulerai.
Quelqu'un a eu un bébé!
J'ai une meilleure idée.
On est la société de livraison "Planet
Express". On a un robot à livrer.
Je suis Bender.
Veuillez insérer disquette.
Ca fera jamais qu'un gadget de plus.
Attention!
Je vais planter ma lentomobile
à cause de vous!
Pendant que vous vous plantez,
dites-nous où ca va.
Au classement central.
- OK. Merci.
- Très aimable.
Bien sûr que je connais.
Je suis un niveau 20!
- Où est-ce?
- Je dirai rien.
- J'ai l'air d'un niveau 16?
- A cette vitesse, on ira nulle part.
Je vais envoyer cette boîte
au classement central.
On va la suivre avec mon localisateur.
Froid. Tiède.
Chaud, chaud, chaud...
Pitié, dites pas à mon chef
que je dormais.
C'est là. On rentre, on prend
la disquette, et on repart. OK?
On la retrouvera jamais!
Je suis Bender.
Veuillez insérer disquette.
T'as raison! Rien n'est perdu
tant qu'il y a un espoir.
Vous cherchez quelque chose? J'aurais
dû me douter que vous viendriez ici.
Eh bien, je m'en suis douté.
Et je suis là.
Entre nous, c'est fini. Vous êtes
méchante. Je veux plus vous revoir!
Mais avant,
vous nous redonnez la disquette?
Elle est dans la pile
des documents entrants.
Et il faudrait une machine trieuse
à moteur nucléaire pour la trouver.
Vous m'avez demandé?
Bon sang, Hermes, saute!
Fais don de tes organes!
Non, je veux vivre!
Réorganiser ce camp de travail a
ranimé mon amour de la bureaucratie.
Il a redistribué les tâches de telle
sorte que les travaux pénibles...
sont effectués par un seul Australien.
- Comment nous as-tu trouvés?
- Grâce au Dr Zoidberg.
C'est moi! Je suis le héros!
Puis-je savoir ce que signifie
cette réunion non autorisée?
Numéro 1.0!
Numéro 1.0, je présente
une demande de recherche urgente...
selon le règlement 2...
Je connais très bien le règlement!
Je faisais partie du comité
qui a révisé...
la couleur du registre
où le règlement est écrit.
On l'a gardé en gris.
Je dois trouver la disquette
avec le cerveau de mon ami.
D'accord, mais vous perdrez
votre licence de bureaucrate...
si vous n'avez pas tout trié
avant la fermeture.
- A 13h.
- Ce qui ne te laisse que 4 minutes.
Demande autorisation de musique.
En Jamaïque, quand je suis né
Un ouragan a tout inondé
J'ai pleuré toute la nuit
Car mon jeu de cubes a été détruit
Je suis né pour être bureaucrate
Car je suis pointilleux et acariâtre
On doit remplir un formulaire
Pour venir à mon anniversaire
- Puis t'as grandi et t'es passé pro
- Je triais sans conviction
- Il voulait juste prendre du galon
- Trier, ça doit être une passion
On choisit pas l'administration
Jah doit bien avoir une raison
On traite les gens comme des bœufs
On vous fait faire la queue
Les gens méprisent les bureaucrates
On est des vraies têtes à claques
Faut faire le métier qu'on aime
Même si ça pose des problèmes
- On m'a déconseillé la chirurgie
- Moqué de mon hot-dog électrique
Piloter, c'est rapé
Faut deux yeux pour voler
Je suis Bender
Veuillez insérer disquette
Toute le monde avec moi:
Jamaïque
Les bureaucrates seulement
Le niveau 19 seulement
- Jamaïque.
- Tous en cœur!
Il faut faire le métier qu'on aime
Même si ça pose des problèmes
Bender est de retour!
Veuillez insérer de l'alcool!
- Ouais!
- Félicitations!
Bravo, mais il vous restait
2 secondes. Je vous rétrograde.
Un bon bureaucrate ne finit jamais
en avance.
Peu importe, on te récupère.
Pas encore. Je conserve
mes fonctions à Planet Express...
et j'ai quelques changements à faire.
Primo, Fry, vous êtes viré.
- Deuzio...
- Attendez!
En triant, je suis tombé sur un vieux
document enregistré par vous.
Formulaire B.
Notification de liaison amoureuse.
C'est vrai, on a fraternisé!
Ca ne vous concerne pas.
C'était mon petit ami du lycée.
C'était un flirt autorisé.
On a rompu avec autorisation.
Oui. Mais vous ne l'avez tamponné
que 4 fois!
Non! Non!
J'étais jeune et insouciante!
Bureaucrate Conrad,
vous avez techniquement raison.
Par la présente,
vous êtes promu au niveau 37.
Quant à vous... Gardes!
Amenez-moi le formulaire nécessaire
pour l'embarquer.
Voilà. Je vais pouvoir récupérer
mon courageux bureaucrate.
Avec une baisse de salaire, bien sûr.
- Ouais!
- C'est mieux que rien.
Moi aussi, je peux revenir
avec une baisse?
Absolument. En fait, je compte baisser
le salaire de tout le monde.
Viens, femme! On se casse!
C'est mon tour de chanter...
Quand j'étais bébé
Y a eu un raz-de-marée...

Bonne nouvelle!
L'université veut me faire passer

Ce n'est pas une bonne nouvelle.

UNIVERSITE DE MARS

HALL SACRE
Professeur Farnsworth,
savez-vous pourquoi vous êtes ici?
Ecoutez, bande d'imposteurs!
Si je coule,
je vous entraîne tous avec moi!
Doyen Vernon, je sais tout.
C'était vous au volant de votre
aérocaisse, pas votre cheval.
Doyen Epsilon...
votre UFR de "Maître Nageur"
ne m'est pas inconnu.
Et Dr Wernstrum?
Wernstrum!
En fait,
nous vous avons fait venir pour...
une surprise!
- Joyeux anniversaire!
- Surprise!
JOYEUX CENT-CINQUANTENAIRE
PROFESSEUR!
Et vous, coach Smalley!
Ou devrais-je dire,
"coach postiche"?
Non, professeur.
C'est une fête surprise...
pour votre 150ème anniversaire!
Bonsoir, je suis...
Pardon.
Je suis Bender, j'anime la soirée.
On dit qu'on peut juger un homme
par son entourage.
Voici un vieil ami du professeur,
un homard grotesque et puant!
Bonsoir, mesdames et microbes.
Ce n'était pas un gag.
Je parlais au Doyen Streptocoque.
Je ne dis pas que le Professeur
est vieux...
mais si on songe à son âge,
on se dit qu'il va bientôt mourir.
Hé, Ringo? C'était ça, le gag.
C'est aussi bien réglé
qu'une émission de télé.
Où en serait un professeur
sans étudiants pour le respecter?
Juste là!
De tous les membres de l'équipage
de son vaisseau de livraison...
notre prochain invité
est le plus vivant.
Capitaine Musky?
Je n'aimerais pas passer après lui.
Et maintenant, un homme
qu'il est inutile de présenter.
Fry, vas-y!
Quand on m'a demandé de faire un film
sur mon neveu...
j'ai pensé, mais pourquoi?
Après, Leela a fait le film.
Mais si je l'avais fait, il y aurait
eu plus de femmes seins nus.
Place au film.
HUBERT FARNSWORTH:
NECROLOGIE D'UN VIVANT
Hubert J. Farnsworth est né
le 9 avril 2851...
dans le quartier le plus nul
de New New York, le Labo de Satan.
Enfant précoce, il lisait déjà
alors qu'il portait des couches...
à huit ans.
Il devint vite un ado bourgeonnant.
Maître du Donjon
Quel ringard!
Après 14 ans de 3ème cycle...
il vécut la vie glamour
de scientifique.
Belles voitures, boîtes de nuit
branchées, femmes splendides.
Le professeur a tout conçu
dans son minuscule studio.
Il a travaillé 50 ans pour
Les Gentils Robots...
où il a créé le 1er robot capable
d'obtenir un prêt pour un bateau.
Aujourd'hui, à l'aube
de son 150ème anniversaire...
il garde toute la fougue
de la jeunesse.
Ecoutez, bande d'imposteurs!
Si je coule,
je vous entraîne tous avec moi!
HUBERT J. FARNSWORTH:
À suivre...?
Vous voulez dire un mot, professeur?
J'ai dit: "un mot".
Quel bonheur de voir
l'œuvre de toute une vie...
résumée dans un film de 3 minutes.
Mes plus belles années
sont derrière moi.
Tant de travaux inachevés.
Et si peu de temps.
Drôle, très drôle!
Ma vie touche à sa fin.
Mais non,
vous avez encore 10 ans à vivre ici.
Leela, il pourrait vivre
encore 100 ans!
Non, il ne le pourrait pas.
A l'âge de 160 ans...
l'Escadron du Crépuscule
vous emmène sur une autre planète.
Pour ne jamais revenir.
Une planète entière de vieux.
C'est où?
Nul ne le sait.
Tant d'amours à moitié aimées.
Tant d'inventions à moitié inventées.
Cette fichue machine à voyager
dans le temps m'a coûté 15 ans.
Si ça marchait, vous remonteriez
le temps sans le perdre.
Personne pour continuer, après moi.
Personne pour reprendre mon travail,
mes recherches ainsi que ma fortune.
Mais oui, c'est ça!
- Il me faut nommer un successeur!
- Un successeur?
Un successeur au professeur?
Pas de temps à perdre.
Je vais au labo construire la machine
à-nommer-les-successeurs!
Ca fait des jours qu'il est au labo!
J'espère qu'il est en vie.
Sauf si je suis le successeur.
Là, j'espère qu'il est mort.
Toi? Faudra d'abord me passer
sur la carapace!
Le professeur me choisira.
Je suis le seul à avoir sa ténacité.
Allez vous faire mettre!
Là où votre espèce
se fourre des choses.
Pour choisir un successeur,
c'est le limbo qu'il faut.
- Quoi?
- Les règles de Kingston.
Deux hommes descendent,
un seul remonte.
Ecoutez, le professeur m'a confié
un vaisseau géant.
Il ne vous confierait pas
son dentier.
Si, il le ferait.
Désolé. Mais les liens du sang
sont plus forts que tout.
Liens. Sang. Forts.
SOURIS:
EMPRUNTEZ LE LABYRINTHE
J'ai une grave nouvelle
à vous annoncer.
Ceux qui ont le cœur fragile,
veuillez sortir.
Au revoir.
Professeur?
Ah, oui! La nouvelle.
Vous savez, mon temps est compté
dans ce monde.
- Oui, nous le savons.
- Un pied dans la tombe.
J'ai choisi mon successeur.
C'est quelqu'un en qui je crois...
même s'il a l'esprit peu développé
et n'a rien accompli.
Mon parent vivant le plus proche...
mon clone, Kubert Farnsworth.
Il est horrible!
Zut. Vous me confiez votre dentier?
Dans tes rêves.
D'où vient-il?
Il y a 12 ans, j'ai commencé
le processus de clonage...
en prélevant des cellules
d'une belle excroissance dans mon dos.
Si c'est votre clone,
pourquoi n'a-t-il pas votre nez?
Je l'ai oublié dans son 1er tube,
ca l'a écrabouillé d'un côté.
Il est bête ou juste moche?
Voyons cela.
Quoi?
Jamais vu le zob d'un génie?
- Jamais.
- Si, dans le parc une fois.
Puisque je vais tout diriger...
laissez-moi inspecter mon équipe.
C'est un bien grand mot.
Tout d'abord, Dr Zoidberg...
avez-vous un diplôme en médecine?
Je l'ai perdu.
Dans un volcan.
Et pourquoi avons-nous
un robot parmi nous?
Quelle utilité peux-tu avoir?
Moi y'en a pas parler anglais.
Pourquoi notre pilote
est-elle borgne?
J'aimerais te présenter quelqu'un.
Son nom est évaluation des distances.
Espèce de petit...
Aïe, ça fait mal... à l'air!
Je vais le masacrar.
Kubert, viens ici.
Il faut que tu voies cette merveille.
C'est quoi, un employé compétent?
J'en doute fort.
Espèce d'andouille.
En tant que successeur,
c'est à toi de poursuivre mon œuvre.
Voici des inventions inachevées
que tu passeras ta vie à terminer.
Je ne savais pas que tu étais
l'inventeur du dépotoir.
J'ai gagné un prix avec l'Odoroscope.
Un chien peut chier n'importe où
dans l'univers, je ne le louperai pas.
Ca, c'est mon traducteur universel.
Mais jusqu'ici...
il traduit en une langue morte
incompréhensible.
- Hello.
- Bonjour.
Quel baragouin!
- Tu n'as pas d'inventions utiles?
- Bien sûr, viens par ici.
Ce sont des moteurs
à matière noire.
Mon vaisseau peut voyager de galaxie
en galaxie en quelques heures.
C'est impossible de dépasser
la vitesse de la lumière.
Non, les scientifiques ont augmenté
la vitesse de la lumière en 2208.
C'est impossible.
Leur chambre à postcombustion
est remarquable...
avec 200% de rendement
de combustible.
Encore plus impossible.
Pas du tout, c'est très simple.
Alors, explique.
Alors ça, c'est impossible!
Ca m'est venu en rêve
et je l'ai oublié dans un autre rêve.
Tes explications ne sont que foutaises
en acier chromé.
Tout ça, c'est impossible!
Rien n'est impossible.
Pas si on l'imagine.
C'est l'essence même du scientifique.
Non, c'est l'essence même
d'un lutin magique.
Chez Elzar
Gastronomie
Oh, mon Dieu!
C'est Elzar, le cuistot de la télé!
Tuez-moi maintenant!
- Tout va bien par ici?
- Elzar, tout est tellement parfait!
Vous êtes une machine lèche-cul?
Oui. Bien trouvé, monsieur!
Cette soirée est un vrai bijou.
Je me sens si bien d'avoir quelqu'un
pour poursuivre mon œuvre.
Tout ça, grâce à Kubert.
Ecoute, je suis peut-être
identique à toi...
mais ça ne signifie pas
que je suis comme toi.
Je ne veux pas devenir inventeur.
Je voudrais être utile,
comme un assistant de prof...
ou gardien de prison
ou auteur de dessins animés SF.
Que fais-tu de mes espoirs
et mes rêves...
et mes inventions fabuleuses?
De toute ta vie, ta seule invention
à peu près potable, c'est moi.
Et je ne suis pas comme
tu aurais voulu.
- Tout va toujours aussi bien?
- Oh, oui, Elzar.
Tant mieux, j'ai oublié de cuire
le poulet.
Mauvaise nouvelle.
Quand vous verrez ceci,
je serai parti...
laissant derrière moi un passé
empli d'échecs et mes hanches.
Voyez-vous, j'ai menti sur mon âge.
Je n 'ai pas 150 ans.
J'en ai 160.
O Vanité, ton nom est
Professeur Farnsworth.
Je n 'ai plus de raison de vivre...
alors, j'ai prévenu les robots
de l'Escadron du Crépuscule.
POUR MON EQUIPE
Adieu, monde cruel!
Adieu, lampe cruelle.
Adieu, rideaux de velours cruels...
doublés de ce qui paraît être
une sorte de mousseline cruelle...
avec ses pompons mignons
au bout des cordons...
bien qu'ils soient cruels...
Je n 'ai plus de raison de vivre...
alors, j'ai prévenu les robots
de l'Escadron du Crépuscule.
Vous êtes tristes, surtout Bender.
Eh bien, la vie continue.
Sauf pour vous!
Il vient d'être méchant.
J'ai effacé ses feuilletons
pour m'enregistrer.
Espèce d'enfoiré!
Il faut qu'on le ramène!
Impossible. Personne ne sait
où sont mis les vieux.
Rien n'est impossible!
Tu saurais ça,
si tu tenais de lui comme moi.
Tu es l'oncle, abruti.
C'est lui qui tient de toi!
Ouais, ben, quoi?
Minute! Ca veut dire
que moi aussi je tiens de toi!
Je sais comment le retrouver.
Vas-y, grosses bottes.
Si on arrive à capter son odeur,
peut-être qu'on pourra le sauver.
Je n'en crois rien.
Comme vous l'ignorez sans doute...
les odeurs sont faites de particules
qui ne peuvent voyager dans l'espace.
Je l'ai dans mon objectif.
Crème pour l'arthrite.
Naphtaline!
Courrier des lecteurs! C'est lui!
Allons à l'astronef!
A gauche! Non, en haut!
Demi-tour!
On ne trouvera pas l'endroit.
Les robots savent garder les secrets.
C'est pas vrai, M. Pipi-au-lit.
Pardon.
La voilà! L'étoile de l'agonie!
On va dire que le professeur
s'est évadé et qu'on le ramène.
Habille-toi comme un vieux de 160 ans.
Ca marche.
Mon Dieu...
l'illusion est si parfaite
que j'avais oublié que tu es un idiot!
Ils vont contrôler l'ADN.
J'aimerais qu'ils le trouvent.
Ce plan est impossible.
On n'a pas l'ADN du professeur.
Je crois savoir où en trouver.
DEPOT DES PENSIONNAIRES
APRES 23H, UTILISEZ LA FENTE
Pourquoi c'est moi la bosse?
Tu es trop moche pour être une verrue.
L'argent de l'assurance maladie.
Halte! Identifiez ce pensionnaire.
C'est le Professeur Hubert Farnsworth.
Un évadé.
Un évadé? Personne ne s'évade.
Il n'a pas l'air d'avoir 160 ans.
Quoi? Je suis vieux. Ecoutez.
Hé, les mioches! Pas sur le gazon!
Les vieux sont préoccupés
par les enfants sur leurs pelouses.
On ne peut le nier. Mais il faut
vérifier son identité avec de l'ADN.
Voici une fournée bien chaude.
Une cellule, ça suffit.
Garde la monnaie, mon pote!
Sale robot.
- Votre bosse parle?
- Le "syndrome de la bosse bavarde".
Ah! Le S.B.B.
PRELEVEMENT DE TISSU
C'est lui. Ramenez ce traînard

- Vous allez être surprise.
C'est ici qu'ils mettent les vieux!
C'est affreux!
Ca les empêche de conduire.
Hubert J. Farnsworth
né 2841 - mort BIENTOT
Préparez-vous au pire.
- Il a l'air si naturel.
- Que se passe-t-il?
Il est relié à un système de survie.
Il faut le débrancher en douceur...
ou le choc pourrait le tuer.
Pas un geste!
Capturez-les!
Attrapez-les! Euh, capturez-les!
Oh! Je suis vraiment nul.
On va probablement y arriver,
ou pas!
- C'est impossible! On ne passe pas!
- Oh que si!
Je te l'avais dit.
Allez, Leela!
Appuie ta botte sur le champignon.
- Ils ont explosé un moteur!
- Répare-le! Répare-le! Répare-le!
Répare-le! Répare-le!
Seul le professeur sait le faire.
Il faut le réveiller.
Il faut le choquer!
La pension est en retard.
Le coût de la vie augmente!
Les jeunes sont grossiers!
Zut, on va le réparer nous-mêmes!
On ne peut pas, enfoiré!
Personne ne sait comment!
C'est impossible!
Rien n'est impossible!
Je sais comment ca fonctionne.
Ca m'est venu en rêve.
Les moteurs
ne déplacent pas le vaisseau!
Le vaisseau reste où il est
et les moteurs font tourner l'univers!
N'importe quoi.
Ce n'est pas n'importe quoi.
Pas si on l'imagine.
C'est l'essence même du scientifique.
Pas vrai?
En route.
Bonne nouvelle!
Il a bien récupéré.
- Super!
- Ouais!
Je suis aussi agile qu'à mes 140 ans.
Voyez? Une seule cheville de cassée.
Ils vous faisaient quoi
dans ce tiroir?
J'étais branché à un monde virtuel
bizarre qui paraissait très réel.
- C'était comment?
- C'était comme si j'étais en Floride.
Il y avait des centaines de vieux.
On jouait, on mangeait de la bouillie
et on attendait des coups de fil.
C'est plus horrible que tout
ce que je peux imaginer.
Oh, oui!
Merci à tous de m'avoir sauvé.
Surtout toi, mon petit clone.
Peu importe ce que tu décideras
de faire de ta vie, je suis fier de toi.
J'ai déjà décidé.
Papa, quand je serai grand,
je veux être comme toi.
Sois sans crainte, fiston.
Tu le seras.
Au fait, documente-toi sur la maladie
appelée vessie vagabonde.
Pourquoi?
Comme ça. Sans raison particulière.

Un sévère avertissement
pour les choses à venir
LE SUD PROFOND
Génial! Le permis pour bébête
que j'ai demandé pour Nibbler est là.
Sympa, j'ignorais
que tu aimais bien Nibbler.
Tu rêves! Je le balancerais
dans un sac au fond d'une rivière...
et la rivière
au fond de l'espace.
Mais j'aime remplir les formulaires,
et là, c'était de la balle!
Par les dreadlocks de Jah!
Il y a eu confusion.
Ce n'est pas un permis de bébête!
C'est un permis de pêche!
Obligatoire!
Pile au milieu de l'océan Atlantique!
Là où les poissons
convergent tout naturellement.
- Ce sont les eaux internationales?
- Exactement.
Faucon, ici Corbeau Bleu.
L'oie a fait son nid.
Devine à quoi tu sers.
Le soleil, l'air marin, de bons amis.
Leela a raison. La pêche, ça traîne.
Pimentons les choses.
- Pourquoi pas?
- Ouais, cool!
Tout le monde lâche 5 billets!
- C'est pas du piment, ça?
- Bender!
C'est du tout vu. Une fois, j'ai pêché
un poisson grand comme ça.
Ah oui? Et moi, grand comme ça.
Aucun de vous ne fera le poids.
Car vous êtes face à une détentrice
de harpon.
Harpon, mes fesses!
Si tu le dis!
Voyons, quel leurre utiliser?
Grillons? Encornets? Cous de coqs?
Excusez mon audace.
Je vous propose mes services
comme goûteur de leurre.
Ces sardines, par exemple,
sont fades et insipides.
Et ces lombrics sont secs et fibreux,
mais savoureux...
très, très savoureux.
J'y crois pas!
Il mange mes leurres!
Tâte ça, écrevisse pirate!
Fry, mate ma canne à pêche laser.
Chut! Tu fais fuir les poissons.
Bien, je vais de l'autre côté.
Bonne pêche chez vous!
Je plante un poisson
entre les 2 yeux à 20 mètres.
- Et moi, une crevette!
- Une crevette?
J'ai du mal à croire que...
Venez voir ça, abrutis!
J'ai le gagnant.
C'est donc là que tu achètes
tes bottines.
Encore deux, et tu pourras te faire
une brochette.
Un tel poisson est digne
d'être un beignet de poisson.
Il est toujours plus gros
que tes prises.
Mon intestin grêle!
Bingo!
Quoi que ce soit, c'est 20 fois
plus lourd qu'une botte.
BOTTES
10 PAIRES
Tu ne prendras rien
avec cette méthode primitive.
Il te faut du phéromone de poisson.
L'aphrodisiaque le plus puissant
de l'espèce marine.
Ce que tu peux me plaire!
Bender, vise la carrure!
N'exagère rien!
Ce truc est nul!
Si je ne dois pas attraper de poisson,
autant tenter gros.
Voilà. La contorsion résout
presque tous les problèmes.
Bender, attention!
C'est l'amarre du bateau
en fil de diamant, incassable.
- Alors pourquoi faire attention?
- C'était à ma grand-mère.
Mon casse-dalle!
SERA REVEILLE A 19H
Debout! J'ai une prise.
Cette fois, c'est vivant!
Dr Zoidberg,
depuis quand portez-vous des bottes?
Je ne les portais pas,
je les mangeais.
Allez, on rentre.
Un coup de soleil!
Mon corps magnifique est foutu!
Où est passé mon parasol?
Il était pas là quand j'ai pris
ton parapluie.
- Je t'ai mis de l'écran total.
- Ca n'a pas marché.
ACCLAMEZ BENDER
LE GRAND
Bender, remonte ta ligne et partons.
Dites, il y a un hic!
Il n'y a pas de hic.
L'homme-mécano a fait une prise!
Par le saint zombie!
Mais c'est énorme!
Ca vient!
- C'est du gros!
- Un bar à gueule colossale!
Il plonge!
Il nous entraîne!
Tous à l'intérieur!
Je vais nous sauver...
en coupant le fil de diamant
incassable.
Au moins, je serai mort
entouré de mes amis. Allô?
Mon maillot de bain!
On est à 1370 mètres!
1460!
1500!
1 kilomètre 5!
Bonté divine!
C'est plus de 150 atmosphères!
Combien le navire en supporte-t-il?
Comme c'est un engin spatial,
je dirais entre zéro et un.
C'est quoi?
Qui s'amuse à tordre les poutres?
On va être écrasés
si on n'égalise pas.
Comment on fait ca?
Comme ca.
On va mourir!
Je reviens dans une minute.
- Tu as réussi, Fry!
- Quoi donc?
Mes amis, c'est bien pire
qu'on ne l'imaginait.
Mon poisson s'est barré!
Comme neuf!
Sauf qu'on est à 5 km sous l'eau,
sans bouffe, dans un navire cassé.
On va perdre notre calme. Pourvu
qu'un robot ne fasse pas de massacre!
Pas de panique. Il suffit d'appliquer
certaines règles.
GUIDE DU CANNIBALISME
L'ordre du jour est le déjeuner.
Je propose un beau homard Zoidberg,
enfin, Newburg.
Enfin, Dr Zoidberg.
Bon, on se calme.
Le professeur et moi
restons dans le navire.
Bender, Zoidberg, vous pouvez aller
sous l'eau. Sortez et trouvez à manger.
J'y vais aussi,
ils ne connaissent pas mes goûts.
La pression va te broyer comme
un serpent sous un camion de sucre!
Pas forcément.
C'est l'occasion pour Fry d'essayer
ma pilule anti-pression expérimentale.
Je ne peux pas avaler ça!
Ca tombe bien!
C'est un suppositoire.
Ca va, Fry?
Tu m'en vois ravi!
Ah, ouais.
Miam, miam.
Regardez!
Je suis le Dr Zoidberg, propriétaire!
Attention, ce drapeau
pourrait être venimeux.
Ohé, matelots!
J'ai déniché un bon remontant!
Les lois de la science
sont une cruelle maîtresse.
Dis, Robot,
tu m'aiderais à bouger un sofa?
D'accord. Mais pas à l'étage.
Qu'y a-t-il, Fry?
Une limonade?
T'as vu une parade?
T'as augmenté ton capital?
Profites-en pour dépanner ton vieux
frère Zoidberg, M. Millionnaire.
Fry, avale avant de parler.
Une sirène!
Tu crois avoir vu une sirène?
J'ai vu une sirène.
Elle portait un bustier...
elle avait une queue en écailles
et de longs cheveux.
- Bien sûr!
- Sans aucun doute!
Tu hallucines, sombre crétin!
Qu'y aurait-il de si absurde?
Le futur regorge
de créatures marines étranges.
Comme le Dr Zoidberg!
Fry souffre de folie océanique.
A chaque fois qu'il m'arrive
un truc bien, c'est de la folie...
de l'ivresse ou une crise de foie.
J'ai vu une vraie sirène!
Et j'aimerais que mes amis
aient la décence de me croire!
Folie océanique.
La folie océanique ne justifie pas
la grossièreté océanique.
Folie océanique. Ben voyons!
Il y a toujours un truc.
C'est elle! Bender, debout!
Elle est là!
Oxygène!
Voilà, trésor.
Je peux respirer et parler
comme un poisson!
Tu parles poisson?
- Pardon?
- Désolée, j'ai un horrible accent.
- Je m'appelle Umbriel.
- Et moi Fry.
- Alors, je vais me noyer?
- Mais non!
Calme-toi et laisse les courants
détendre chacun de tes muscles.
Ca s'est réchauffé, non?
J'ai du mal à croire
que tu es réelle. Jolie queue.
Merci! J'aime bien ce truc
ondulant qui sort de tes hanches.
Merci. C'est un pantalon.
C'est une cheminée volcanique.
- L'eau sortante dépasse 2200 degrés.
- Sans blague.
Ca s'est rafraîchi, non?
Raconte-moi cet étrange monde terrien
d'où tu viens.
Il y a aussi de l'eau?
Oui, elle peut même tomber du ciel.
Ou pas.
M. Fry, quel beau parleur!
Ce que j'aime chez toi,
c'est que tu me trouves fascinant...
sans que j'aie à dire que je suis
dompteur d'éléphants.
Des éléphants?
Des éléphants de mer sur la terre?
Des éléphants de mer terrestres.
J'en dresse.
J'ai reconfiguré le système
de propulsion.
On pourra partir
dès que le papier mâché sera sec.
- Où est Fry?
- Je l'ai pas tué, et vous?
Non, j'avais à faire.
Il a dû aller chercher sa sirène.
Pauvre blanc devenu fou.
C'est la folie océanique,
c'est sûr.
Les marins l'appellent aqua dementia.
La folie abyssale.
La trouille de l'eau.
L'humidité hurlante.
Formons un raid de recherche.
Il faut de l'oxygène.
C'est bon.
En cas d'urgence, mes fesses pourront
faire office de dispositif flottant.
Vous avez tous pris
vos pilules anti-pression?
Oui! On vous l'a déjà dit!
J'ai une piste par là,
où l'eau devient plus chaude.
Par là!
Tordez-moi!
Mince! Une ville submergée!
Est-ce bien possible? Les vieilles
légendes seraient-elles vraies?
Oui! C'est la légendaire
citée engloutie d'Atlanta!
Salut à tous!
Bienvenue à Atlanta!
Ici, on m'appelle "Le Colonel".
Prenez des respirateurs,
offerts par notre chambre de commerce.
C'est inconfortable et humiliant!
S'ils pouvaient faire ça
en suppositoire...
Vous vous plairez ici!
Le tourisme est notre principal revenu.
Visitez, dépensez!
Pitié, ne partez pas!
Fry, je savais que tu étais en vie!
Je te dois 10 $.
Il s'est passé un truc incroyable!
C'est le mardi "2 pour le prix d'1".
Et il y a des sirènes.
Je vous présente ma fille, Umbriel.
Umbriel, voici des Yankees.
Atlanta était une ville américaine
à ton époque?
C'était juste un aéroport,
avec un stand de cacahuètes.
La Vieille Atlanta était plus
qu'un hub de Delta!
C'était une métropole animée,
comme Paris ou New York.
Oui, chérie. On te croit.
Voyez ces ruines majestueuses.
Turner Field...
L'usine Coca-Cola...
L'aéroport.
Comment une ville dotée d'un tel
aéroport a pu finir submergée?
Cette histoire est disponible
sur la vidéo...
de notre troubadour folk-rock Donovan.
Atlanta était une ville enclavée.
A des centaines de km de ce qu'on
appelle maintenant l'océan Atlantique.
Prête à tout pour devenir touristique,
la ville...
déménagea au large et devint
une île et un grand hub de Delta.
Surdéveloppée, la ville
commença à sombrer.
Conscients de leur destin,
ses bienfaiteurs s 'enfuirent.
Ted Turner, Hank Aaron,
Jeff Foxworthy...
l'inventeur du Coca-Cola...
le magicien, et les autres dieux
qui peuplent nos légendes.
Les dieux s 'en furent.
Jane Fonda y était aussi.
Les autres restèrent...
sous leurs vérandas, armés de fusils...
puis évoluèrent en sirènes.
Ils chantèrent, dansèrent
et célébrèrent l'ère nouvelle.
Salut Atlanta!
Le magicien?
Ca ne prend pas des millions d'années
pour évoluer en sirène?
Si, mais la caféine
a accéléré le processus.
C'est un truc fantastique!
Quand Umbriel a ramené
ce nordiste repenti, j'étais contre.
Mais que mes vieilles jambes
repoussent!
Vous me flattez, Colonel!
On doit partir. Ma femme
et mon oxygène me manquent.
Nos proches et nos gaz
nous manquent. Allez, Fry.
Je ne pars pas avec vous.
Et nous?
Et ta vie en surface?
Tu n'es pas d'ici.
C'est vrai. Ils ont les Braves,
mais ça reste bas de gamme.
Fry, espèce de dégénéré!
Sois raisonnable!
Sais-tu qu'à force de rester
à cette profondeur...
tu t'adapteras à la pression?
Le savoir?
Je comprends même pas!
Tu ne pourras plus revivre
à la surface.
Ca m'est égal.
J'ai tout ce que je veux ici.
Je m'ennuie! Partons!
Fry, j'ai un petit chez moi
à la frontière de la ville.
Tu me rendras visite?
Désolé, le country club
s'y opposerait.
Tu vas me manquer!
Revenez vite, surtout!
On s'arrache, allez!
C'est le moment des adieux
pour moi aussi.
- C'est ca.
- A plus!
SAS
Ma maison! Elle a brûlé!
- Mais comment?
- C'est une bonne question!
Mon cigare était donc là!
Ca soulève d'autres questions!
Ces dernières 24 heures ont été
les plus belles de ma vie.
Fais de la sirène que je suis
une Sisi-reine.
Ci-mer! Je crois bien
que j'ai des vapeurs.
C'est quoi, ça?
Je suis perplexe aussi!
Comment...
Avec la queue et tout?
C'est ta première fois?
Je mets mes œufs, je me dégage
et tu lâches les tiens.
Si seulement elle avait été
une sirène inversée...
poisson en haut et femme en bas!
Qui sera mon cavalier
au bal des débutantes?
Que dirais-tu de ce jeune esturgeon
de Macon?
Le moteur est complètement réparé.
Paré au lancement.
Attendez-moi!
Ne me laissez pas là!
En récompense de cette prise record...
je suis fier d'accorder à Bender
ce chèque de 1000 dollars!
- Toi!
- Ouais, mon pote!
Mon casse-dalle!
- Ca va? Que s'est-il passé?
- Et Umbriel?
Notre amour, quoique réciproque,
n'était pas assez pénétrant.
Problèmes au pieu.
C'est bon de te revoir!
Attendez, ce n'est pas un record!
Rendez-moi ce chèque!
Il ira à des orphelins géants.
Bender, tu me fais mal!
Dites donc, j'essaie de dormir!
Salut Atlanta!

Celle-lŗ.
Non, elle ťtait moins bonne.
Bon, pas mal, pas mal!
Et voici notre chef,

MOINS D'APPLAUDISSEMENTS
Super. Oui.
Vous aimez la cuisine cajun, j'espŤre.
Au menu d'aujourd'hui:
Gombo d'huÓtres ŗ la sauce Neptune.
PremiŤre ťtape: Faire bouillir
des huÓtres dans un fait-tout.
Bouillir? Ca m'intťresse!
- Bender, arrÍte de parler.
- Non, toi la ferme!
De temps en temps, allez-y un bon
coup avec votre fouine ŗ ťpice.
Vlan!
Oui! Et vlan!
Encore un petit coup!
Comment on l'a laissť entrer,
celui-lŗ?
Mouline cette fouine, mauviette!
Vas-y!
Si vous promettez d'arrÍter.
Je suis contre,
mais je vais en rajouter.
Je dois immortaliser Áa sur pellicule.
Allez un bon coup!
Mon úil! Je n'y vois plus rien!
HOPITAL
TACO BELLEVUE
Alors, docteur,
comment va mon kyste?
Grande.
J'ai dŻ perdre plus de patients
qu'il n'en a soignťs.
Qu'est-ce que c'est, selon vous?
Une tache grise.
Bien. Et ceci?
Une tache grise?
Pas vraiment... Vous souffrez
d'une lťgŤre irritation de la cornťe.
Tu dis n'importe quoi, fiston.
Tu as peut-Ítre fait des ťtudes
et tu as un diplŰme...
mais j'ai plus d'expťrience dans
ma pince que toi dans ta carapace.
Vous Ítes tendu. Prenez ca.
C'est Áa, essaie de m'amadouer.
Mais, c'est peine perdue, fiston!
Pourquoi se bagarrer?
Reposez vos yeux. Portez ce bandeau
pendant une semaine.
Une semaine? Qu'en pensez-vous,
Dr Zoidberg?
Clac.
Merci de ton aide, Leela.
Leela! On est lŗ!
Je ne suis pas sourde.
Je dois juste porter ce bandeau.
Ai-je l'air stupide?
Non! Ca te va si bien.
J'aimerais avoir le mÍme.
Tiens, Elzar!
Je suis si excitť!
J'en ferais presque dans ma culotte.
Je voudrais me faire pardonner.
Je vous invite tous
dans mon restaurant.
Je vais vous mijoter
un dÓner inoubliable!
- Super!
- Oui!
Vive notre ťclopťe!
Je commence ŗ redescendre sur terre.
Chez Elzar
Gastronomie
Attention les papilles! Vous allez
vous retrouver au paradis.
J'ai prťparť ŗ chacun
son plat prťfťrť. Rťgalez-vous!
Ca alors, un assortiment
de cuisine jamaÔcaine!
Poulet sťchť, búuf sťchť, porc
sťchť. Rien que de la viande sťchťe!
Ce crabe couronnť est royal!
Et on peut manger sa couronne!
- C'est fait en quoi?
- En bois.
Oh, Fry! Tu dois absolument
goŻter ce plomb fondu ŗ la niÁoise.
Non, merci. C'est de la bouffe
de robots.
Succulent! GoŻte un peu.
Non, merci...
Ca va, Leela?
Oh oui, cette salade est dťlicieuse.
Quelle fraÓcheur!
Bon sang! Ces carottes vapeur
ťtaient trop ťpicťes.
Vous vous rťgalez?
- Oh oui!
- Et comment, Elzar!
Ca a ťtť un plaisir de cuisiner
pour vous. Et pour en Ítre quitte...
la maison vous offre ces chocolats.
Qu'y a-t-il en dessous?
Prenez tout votre temps.
- Dis donc!
- L'addition?
Vous nous faites payer
aprŤs m'avoir aveuglťe?
Je ne vous ai pas servi
un festin par charitť.
- 1200 dollars?
- Doux zombie Jťsus!
Mais on n'a pas autant!
Surtout pas lui.
On m'a retirť mes cartes de crťdit!
D'accord, je m'en charge.
Pas de problŤme.
On vous arrÍte, pique-assiettes.
Vous devriez avoir honte.
Il essaie de s'ťvader!
- Je me curais le nez.
- Il se cure le nez. Matraquez-le.
Papa tenait un resto qui a dŻ fermer
ŗ cause de parasites comme vous.
Alors je suis devenu flic.
L'heure de la vengeance a sonnť.
Me frappez pas! Je suis fragile.
Minute! J'ai trouvť une solution.
Ecoutez donc ce robot!
J'adore la cuisine
et Elzar a besoin d'assistant.
- Absolument!
- Et si je bossais pour rembourser?
D'habitude, j'engage du personnel
juste un peu moins insupportable.
- Bender est un employť modŤle!
- Si poli!
- Et si travailleur.
- Une vraie perle!
D'accord, je veux bien essayer.
- Gťnial!
- Pas possible!
Ne fourre pas ton nez partout.
Fastoche!
J'en ai pas, de toute faÁon!
La rťunion de 10 h va commencer!
Mais oý est Leela?
J'arrive.
Je me dťbrouille trŤs bien.
J'ai juste mis un peu plus de temps
pour arriver.
Nibbler voulait absolument
passer par le zoo.
N'hťsite pas ŗ demander de l'aide.
Je peux te maquiller.
Je n'ai besoin de personne.
Je me suis dťbrouillťe toute seule.
T'as l'air splendide.
Justement, j'adore Picasso!
Je vais bosser au restaurant.
Quelqu'un doit me remplacer
en mon absence.
Je vais construire quelqu'un
pour prendre ta place!
Un monstre mťcanique
ŗ moteur gamma...
avec des rampes en guise de bras
et un cúur de charbon.
Si mon remplaÁant n'assure pas,
faites-moi signe.
J'ai fini de dťboucher l'ťvier.
Je prendrais bien un bonbon.
Qu'est-ce que je fais, maintenant?
P‚tisserie? Sauce? Soupe?
Vlan!
Je t'en foutrais des "vlan"!
C'est qui?
De bons clients.
Ne m'en demande pas plus!
- Ils sont de la robotmafia?
- Oui.
C'est une table, pour vous?
C'est une table, Áa?
J'assommerais mÍme pas
un mec avec ca.
Don Bot n'apprťcie pas.
Je devrais vous pincer.
Calmos, la Tenaille. Le Patron
veut Ítre dos face au mur...
comme ŗ cette table.
Mais cette table est...
Laissez-moi arranger Áa!
En fait, je voulais plutŰt...
- Oh!
- C'est inadmissible!
MÍlez-vous de vos affaires
et dehors!
J'aime l'impertinence de ce garÁon.
RECHARGES POUR FOUINE

Je lui file des chaussures

et il les prťfŤre ŗ celles en plomb.
Et tu penses que le compte y est?
C'est quoi, cette monnaie?
Je t'ai filť 100.
Vous m'avez donnť 50.
- Pas du tout.
- Mais si.
T'essaies d'arnaquer le patron?
J'essaie mais c'est pas ťvident.
Vous avez vu ce culot!
Tu me plais, petit. Prends Áa.
- C'est du fric.
- Merci bien.
Tu les as gagnťs tes 50.
- Vous m'avez donnť 20.
- Ah bon?
Dťsolť, je voulais...
Attends un peu!
Tu m'es sympathique. Tu veux
bosser comme homme de main?
Vous plaisantez!
J'en ai toujours rÍvť!
Elzar! Je dťmissionne.
Bien.
CommenÁons par une petite livraison.
C'est pour une petite loterie privťe.
Vous trafiquez les chiffres?
Que du classique.
Surtout, les 1 et les 0.
Livre cette disquette ŗ Sammy

Tu veux bosser pour la robotmafia?
J'en fais presque partie.
Je suis flattť, monsieur.
Mais je suis programmť pour vendre

Bon sang, les flics!
- T'as vu quelque chose de louche?
- Non.
Mais lis la page de BD. Gťnial!
C'est le voyou de chez Elzar!
Filature discrŤte en cours, ma poule.
- Je t'ai eu!
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?

- Oui.

Bienvenue aux riches dťbutants
De la part de M. Bender.
Bravo. T'as rťussi l'ťpreuve.

Alors rendez-vous
au QG de l'organisation.

Don Bot, pitiť.
Je peux pas rembourser cette semaine.
Cherche dans ton disque dur
et ouvre ton fichier "pitiť".
Fichier introuvable.
Que ca te serve d'avertissement.
Merci, Don Bot.
Joe Modem. La Tenaille. Don Bot.
On est sur un gros coup,
mais on a besoin de gros bras.
Du genre de ceux-lŗ?
Ce mec est fort comme un búuf!
Et si on le surnommait...
La Tenaille?
C'est dťjŗ mon nom, tÍte de núud!
Tu veux un coup de pince!
Et pourquoi pas Blotto?
C'est viril, Áa sonne bien
et je peux garder mes initiales.
Malin!
Ce coup, c'est pas pour les enfants
de chúur. Y a du monde ŗ dessouder.
Un coup de pince par-ci,
un coup de pince par-lŗ.
Alors, Blotto? Ca marche?
Gťnial. J'ai toujours rÍvť
de devenir gangster.
Alors je dis... oui!
- Super!
- Il va y avoir de l'action!
Etant donnť qu'on va commettre
des crimes...
il te faut un alibi.
Un alibi?
Je suis patraque.
J'ai mal au cúur.
On doit manger une glace
avant de dťcoller!
Je ne peux pas bouger.
J'ai envie de rendre.
Reste couchť. Je mange ta part.
Bender est malade.
Je t'aide ŗ dťcoller?
Ca va aller. Un vrai pilote
sait naviguer ŗ l'intuition.
Ca sera dťduit de votre salaire.
Tu connais le secret
de la cuisine robotique?
Primo, de l'huile
de qualitť supťrieure.
Alors, c'est quoi ce coup du siŤcle?
Braquage d'un stock de cigares Zuban.
Mais, ce sont les meilleurs
de tout l'univers!
Je pourrais enfumer
toute une maternitť avec ca!
Notre pigeon est en vue.
Tirons-lui dessus.
Voilŗ le plan de bataille.
On tire, ils se rendent,
on monte ŗ bord...
on pique les cigares
et on se casse.
Et tout ca sans un mort.
C'est trop fortiche, Áa!
Je suis ťpatť!
- Mais on les tuera.
- On a plus de pinces qu'eux.
Ils ne sauront mÍme pas
ce qui leur arrive.
Tu rates des trucs...
parce qu'il y un navire
qui tire sur un autre.
Contournement!
- Euh, Leela...
- Me distrais pas!
Je dois Ítre trŤs concentrťe!
- Missile ťvitť.
- Les yeux, c'est pour les nuls.
Leur dťsir de vivre est un affront.
Baisse une fenÍtre
et tire-leur dessus.
Oh, je suis blessť!
Ce qu'il tire bien!
Minute, d'habitude il y a...
le nom de l'ťquipement du vaisseau,
et lŗ, c'est ťcrit "Nibbler".
Je reprends les commandes, Fry.
Super. Pour une fois que j'oublie
de prendre une assurance-voyages.
Ils se rapprochent de nous.
On devrait les pincer!
Tu crois?
Pour toi, je devrais me servir
de ces pinces en toute occasion?
T'es gťnial, pauvre crťtin!
ARRIVEE DU CARBURANT
Ne pas pincer
Le rťacteur a calť!
J'essaie la pompe manuelle.
Salut. On est de la robotmafia.
On est toute la robotmafia.
On vient voler vos cigares.
- Pas question!
- Sauf si on a la vie sauve!
Alors, vous vous en tirerez.
B‚illonne-les avant qu'ils n'aient
le temps de nous identifier.
Patron, quelqu'un nous a devancťs!
C'est une blague ŗ mes dťpens.
A qui le tour de rigoler,
maintenant?
Oý est Blotto?
Il devrait Ítre lŗ,
pour apprendre le mťtier.
MODULATEUR DE VOIX
ROBOT-ROI
Excusez mon retard, vieille noix.
Je savourais mon sandwich au cresson.
Il est plus sophistiquť
que je ne pensais. Attache-les!
Riche idťe, vieille branche!
Veux-tu bien me l‚cher!
Cette voix me dit quelque chose.
Mon Dieu, qu'est-ce qui...
Rien d'intťressant ŗ voir!
Hť, patron.
Il y a un robot dans l'ťquipage.
Bon, alors retrouvez-le.
Branchez-le puis dťbranchez-le.
- Non!
- Je lui rťserve une petite surprise.
Mes pinces!
Une minute, mon vieux.
Laisse-moi faire avec ce tas
de ferraille. Je n'ai pas peur.
Pauvre Bender.
Oh, je suis patraque...
Prends ca! Et ca!
Prends Áa, crťtin!
Pitiť!
C'est le dernier.
Bon, arrangeons Áa ŗ la mode mafia.
Joe, incendie le navire.
La Tenaille, brŻle l'ťquipage.
Donny, donne-moi ma chance!
Laisse-moi faire le sale boulot.
Hť, j'aime ton attitude.
Et ton accent.
Continue comme ca et t'auras
ta propre paire de pinces.
On va lui donner des pinces?
Des pinces, et puis quoi encore!
Leela, on n'en a plus
pour trŤs longtemps...
alors ťvoquons le souvenir de Bender.
C'ťtait un ordinateur
bourrť de magie.
A l'aide!
- Bender!
- Tu es vivant!
Oh oui!
Je viens de reprendre conscience!
J'ai une idťe.
Ca va cťder!
- Gťnial!
- T'as raison, Áa a cťdť!
Leela ťtait aux commandes.
Et quand elle cogne, Áa fait mal.
Ca fait vraiment mal!
Le grand moment est arrivť.
Je vais retirer mon bandeau...
Laissez-moi faire.
AprŤs tout, c'est moi le mieux ťquipť.
C'est Blotto!
J'ai vu ce gangster
quand mon bandeau est tombť.
Professeur, oý ťtiez-vous hier soir?
Mais oý suis-je maintenant?
Dťsolť, on est FERME
Ils m'envoient ce pauvre gosse
pour me tuer!
Je ne me rendrai pas sans me battre.
Bravo, monsieur. Mais je viens
vous livrer votre part du magot.
Oh, les jolies petites coupures!
Dis ŗ Don Bot
que je dťmissionne du syndicat.
Je veux me ranger, maintenant.
C'est marrant, Bender.
Avec toi malade et Leela aveugle...
y a que moi qui sais
ce qui s'est passť!
Mais je vous raconterai
peut-Ítre un jour!
Et moi, je ne t'ťcouterai
peut-Ítre pas!

UNIQUEMENT POUR USAGE EXTERNE
DELICIEUX ENFANTS
Je hais les Taxos.
Au moment de t'offrir un verre...
ils prétendent
avoir changé de pantalon.
Pantalon qu'ils m'ont emprunté!
C'est pręt?
Les Taxos ont pillé le garde-manger.
Ils n'ont laissé que la levure
de cuisine et les câpres. Regardez!
Génial! On est encore
ŕ deux jours de la Terre.
Battez-vous. Je cuisinerai le perdant.
Travaille-le bien, ça l'attendrira.
Il y a peut-ętre un fast-food lŕ-bas!
Un Burger Jerk ou un Fishy Joe.
Tu ręves!
On est au milieu de nulle part.
Il n'y aura peut-ętre
męme pas de MacDo.
C'est une plančte de type M,
on doit y trouver des myrtilles.
J'adore la cueillette.
J'attrape souvent des champignons.
J'ai trouvé des pierres!
Vous aimez ça, non?
Męme sautées dans un peu de boue?
Regardez!
On dirait des crevettes!
Tu rigoles!
On dirait plutôt des gambas grillées.
Cette chose que j'ai ŕ mon poignet dit
que ce n'est pas toxique.
Alors, c'est comment?
C'est fantastique! C'est comme le sexe.
Enfin, d'aprčs mes souvenirs.
Idéal pour accompagner les pierres!
En voilŕ encore!
- Il y en a partout!
- Ramenons-en.
- Je m'en remplis la panse!
- Quel gâchis! On remplit les cales!
Planet Express,
vous pouvez atterrir.
Message reçu!
Ca se mange tout seul, ce truc!
C'est une découverte culinaire
de premier ordre.
C'est meilleur que les śufs
de pingouin. Ca s'appelle comment?
- Ca n'a pas encore de nom.
- Que diriez-vous de "roupettes"?
- Pas ca.
- Pourquoi?
Ca rappelle trop
ces petites viennoiseries...
Tu sais, les chouquettes.
Les deux seuls noms
qui n'aient pas été déposés sont...
"Popplers" et "Zittzers".
- Appelons ça des "Popplers"!
- Bonne idée!
Bien trouvé.
Peu importe leur nom.
C'est de la nourriture gratuite.
Hé, vas-y mollo, Sigmund!
Je déteste que les pauvres
mangent gratuitement.
Il faut les commercialiser!
- Bonne idée!
- Je suis génial!
POPPLERS FRAIS
- C'est une réussite.
- Oui, mais pas encore un triomphe!
Poussez pas!
Y en aura pour tout le monde!
Je les mets oů, les crottes de souris
que vous avez commandées?
Mais c'est pas toi,
le livreur habituel!
Des Popplers? Jamais goűté.
Satisfaction garantie!
Excellent!
Les gars, c'est votre jour de chance!
Je suis Joe Gillman.
- Vous ętes client chez Fishy Joe?
- Mais non! Fishy Joe, c'est moi!
J'ai des restaurants
sur toutes les plančtes.
Sauf sur MacPluton.
Il faut revoir
vos aires de jeux pour enfants.
- Ajoutez un toboggan spécial robots.
- J'y penserai. C'est excellent!
- C'est combien?
- 1 $ les 12.
Vous y perdez.
Fournissez-moi...
et je les vends 2 $ les 12
dans mes restos.
Moi, je vous les achčte 1 $.
Je vais ętre riche!
Toi aussi, mais ça m'excite moins.
On signe quand?

DE POPPLERS SERVIS
Ca fait deux fois cette semaine!
Désolée. J'ai été distraite
par la manifestation.
ARRETEZ AVANT D'ECLATER
MANGER, C'EST TUER
LES POPPLERS SONT
DES ETRES VIVANTS!
Si vous n'ętes pas des manifestants
naturistes, sortez de ma propriété!
La propriété, ça n'existe pas,
mon pote!
Je suis pas un hippie fauché, moi!
Que voulez-vous?
On milite pour le traitement
humain pour les animaux!
Les Popplers sont des ętres vivants.
Il faut arręter de les cueillir!
- Sinon quoi?
- Sinon on boycotte Fishy Joe!
Vous ętes végétariens.
Quel intéręt?
La ferme!
Un animal en mange d'autres.
C'est naturel.
Non, c'est faux. On a appris
ŕ un lion ŕ se nourrir de tofu.
On ne doit pas manger
des ętres qui ressentent la douleur.
- T'es sauvé, alors!
- Je ramčne d'autres briques.
Tu aurais dű jeter ces vieux Popplers.
Ils sont devenus gros et visqueux.
Il en reste un.
Maman!
SAUCE MIEL-MOUTARDE
Arrętez de manger des Popplers!
- Pourquoi?
- Ma bibine!
Ils sont intelligents!
Celui-lŕ m'a appelée maman!
Félicitations!
J'imagine qu'Amy est le pčre?
Ils ne parlent pas.
Tu as des hallucinations
parce que tu as faim. Mange!
- Non!
- Allez! Vas-y, mange!
- Désolée.
- Tu devrais t'étendre un peu.
C'est ça, écoute ton mari.
Il m'a parlé, je vous dis.
Allez, petit Poppler. Dis maman.
Parler ne signifie pas forcément
ętre intelligent.
- On mange bien les perroquets.
- Peut-ętre qu'on l'a dressé pour ça.
- Comme Fry.
- Comme Fry!
Il n'y a qu'une seule façon de savoir
si un animal est intelligent.
Disséquer son cerveau.
Non, maman!
Empęche Papi!
Assez de blabla!
Préparez le spécimen!
- Délicieux.
- Je veux bien de la sauce.
Ne mangez plus de Popplers!
Ils parlent!
Ne parlez plus!
Mangez des Popplers!
- Arręte!
- Des bons de réduction! Prenez-les!
Vous ne passerez pas! Les Popplers
sont aussi intelligents que nous!
Parle pour toi.
Oyez, oyez, bonnes gens!
Ne mangez plus de Popplers!
Ne les trempez plus dans la sauce
miel-moutarde ou aigre-douce!
Ne goűtez pas
notre salade aux Popplers!
N'achetez pas
notre paquet promotionnel de 12!
Ne savourez plus nos Popplers
dans le patio, la voiture ou en bateau.
Quand il s'agit
de prendre du bon temps...
NE MANGEZ PAS DE POPPLERS
Au sommaire, ce soir...
Manger des Popplers.
Est-ce moral?
Avec nous, le PDG de Fishy Joe,
M. "Fishy" Joseph Gillman.
Le militant anti-bouffe,
Free Waterfall Junior.
Et le découvreur des Popplers,
le Capitaine Taronga Leela.
- Taronga?
- C'est son prénom, Philip.
Est-ce mal de manger
des animaux intelligents?
Pas du tout. Je crois
que nous sommes tous d'accord.
- Pas moi.
- Ni moi.
Il s 'agit d'un aliment sans graisse
et juteux financičrement.
T'es fou, mon vieux. Il est fou.
- Leur intelligence est contestable.
- La ferme.
- Non! Ils parlent. Dis maman.
- Caca.
On bipera ça.
On peut manger de la viande.
- On est tous d'accord, je crois.
- Non!
- Mais ces animaux sont évolués!
- La ferme.
Epargnez-nous
vos théories douteuses.
Si on ne mange pas les gens,
c'est ŕ cause du goűt.
Vous ętes fous.
Laissez-moi parler.
- La ferme.
- Vous, fermez-la.
Ils ne sont pas plus évolués que
d'autres aliments, chats compris.
- Gros caca. Espčce de gros caca.
- J'insiste, monsieur.
S'ils sont si malins,
pourquoi ne se défendent-ils pas?
- Arrętez!
- C'est un meurtre!
Appelez ça un meurtre
si vous voulez. Allez-y...
essayez de m'arręter!
Il semble que nous ayons
un problčme technique.
Un merdier comme j'en ai jamais vu!
Terriens, ici le Souverain
de la plančte Omicron Persei 8.
Eteins la télé, Indunda.
Mon Dieu, ils sont de retour!
- C'est la fin!
- C'est la fin!
C'est la fin!
Les Popplers sont issus
d'une plančte-garderie de notre secteur.
Vous avez dévoré nos bébés!
Que justice soit faite!
Puisque vous avez mangé nos enfants,
nous allons vous manger!
Nous commencerons par les pompiers,
les profs de math...
et ainsi de suite
jusqu'au dernier d'entre vous.
Message terminé!
Pas mal, hein?
On a toujours envie de se gratter
quand on peut pas le faire.
Ah... Ça fait du bien.
Hein? On est encore ŕ l'antenne?
BIENVENUE AUX OMICRONIENS
Au nom de tous les Terriens...
je regrette vivement
ce génocide omicronien.
Nous partageons votre douleur.
Si nous pouvions revenir en arričre...
Ca doit bien aller avec le quac-a-mole.
Arrętez!
D'abord, on dit guacamole!
D'accord, je les fais disparaître.
Que voulez-vous exactement?
Nous exigeons...
de manger un Terrien
par Omicronien mort!
C'est de bonne guerre.
Quel est le total?
198 milliards, monsieur.
C'est ca. Vous devez nous fournir
198 milliards de Terriens.
- Avec des frites.
- Lure!
D'accord.
Avec du fromage blanc.
Monsieur?
Il n'y a pas assez de Terriens.
Un petit détail:
Nous ne sommes pas assez.
Nous attendrons
que la population augmente.
198 milliards de bébés
en quelques semaines?
Des légions d'hommes virils
devront se relayer.
Je participerai.
Kif, annule tous mes rendez-vous.
Qu'ils nous exterminent
une fois pour toutes.
- L'attente est insupportable.
- C'est stupide.
SALLE DE REUNION SECRETE
Chers concitoyens,
nous sommes tombés d'accord.
Grâce ŕ mes talents de négociateur...
j'ai vaincu nos vils ennemis
par le biais d'un accord bilatéral.
- Ils ne nous mangeront pas tous.
- J'ai bouffé trop de cacahučtes.
Ils ne dévoreront
qu'un seul Terrien de leur choix.
Nous mangerons le premier humain
qui a mangé nos enfants.
Voilŕ la coupable,
filmée par une caméra de surveillance.
Elle sera sacrifiée
et les autres auront la vie sauve!
LES CONCERTS SLURM PRESENTENT:
LE MONSTRE ANTHROPOPHAGE
Ce soir,
le monde s'appręte ŕ trembler...
en assistant ŕ l'ingestion
d'un Terrien en direct.
Ce carnage inimaginable
est parrainé par Fishy Joe!
Goűtez notre nouveau
Jus de Morse Extręme!
Garanti 100% de pur jus de morse!
Buvez du morse!
Mesdames et messieurs!
Les Omicroniens!
Salut, steaks d'humain!
- T'es naze!
- Va te coucher!
Tu vas me manquer, Leela.
Tu n'es qu'un ętre
ŕ base de carbone...
mais je me souviendrai de toi
comme d'un gros morceau de titane.
Bender veut dire que tu es courageuse,
intelligente et belle. Tu es son amie.
Un vrai morceau de titane!
C'est pas juste!
J'ai essayé de défendre les Popplers!
Vous les avez dévorés
comme des ogres!
Et vous leur marchiez dessus
pour vous amuser!
- Vous devriez ętre ŕ ma place!
- Quelle mentalité d'aluminium!
Ma chérie, je viens te sauver.
J'ai un plan d'enfer.
Super... Le Capitaine Grolâche
a un plan!
Explique-le ŕ Wingus et Dingus.
Wingus? Dingus? On va rouler
les envahisseurs dans la farine.
C'est ça. J'ai trouvé un singe
qui ressemble ŕ s'y méprendre ŕ Leela.
Il ne me ressemble pas du tout!
Surtout les cheveux.
Pas d'inquiétude. Kif est un coiffeur
hors-pair. Ca se voit, non?
Ca peut marcher. Les Omicroniens
ne sont pas trčs physionomistes.
Exact. Ils ont pris Kif
pour l'homme d'Etat...
et moi pour un malade mental.
Pas vrai, Kif?
Ne me déconcentrez pas!
Voilŕ!
- C'est Leela!
- C'est troublant!
J'ai faim!
Amenez-moi cette fameuse Leela.
- Avec salade ou soupe?
- Salade.
- Fromage blanc ou vinaigrette?
- Vinaigrette.
Balsamique ou framboise?
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça?
C'est bizarre.
Amis Terriens... Chut...
- D'accord.
- Je vois.
C'est elle. Pas de doute.
Je reconnais sa posture lascive
et ses doigts poilus.
Tu ne veux pas un peu d'humain
avec ton sel?
Nous y voilŕ. S'il se laisse prendre ŕ
la supercherie, la Terre sera sauvée.
Parrainé par Fishy Joe.
Un morse dans votre verre.
Arrętez! C'est un leurre!
Ce n'est pas Leela!
Quoi? Je perds mon public!
C'est un orang-outang,
une créature précieuse de Mčre Nature.
Tu pouvais pas fermer ton clapet,
hippie puant?
Tu sacrifies une belle femme
pour un singe quelconque?
T'as dű fumer un truc bizarre.
Ce hippie puant a raison!
Il s'agit d'un singe!
Oui. Je confirme.
Oů est cette femme?
- Je ne dirai rien.
- Oů est-elle?
Je vous l'amčne.
Ca risque de compromettre
notre relation, j'en suis conscient.
- Va te faire compromettre.
- Silence! Tu vas refroidir!
Pitié! Je viens de rembourser
ma voiture!
- Non!
- Je veux pas voir ça!
Terriens, je m'appelle Jurr,
je suis de la plančte Omicron Persei 8.
Vous m'ajustez le micro?
Si Leela se fait dévorer,
il faudra me dévorer aussi.
Disparais, petit!
Sinon, je compte jusqu'ŕ blorks!
Mais Souveraine...
Ecoutez! Il existe
de bonnes raisons pour manger!
La faim, l'ennui, vouloir devenir
l'homme le plus gros du monde...
Mais pas la vengeance.
Ne soyons pas pire qu'eux.
En plus, Leela est mon amie.
- C'est ton amie?
- Oui, c'est vrai!
Le baragouinage de Leela
m'a ouvert les yeux!
C'est un bon début.
C'est trčs positif.
Vous allez tous vous donner la main.
Allez-y.
Vous allez faire une chaîne
de l'amitié. A mon signal.
C'est parti!
- C'est aussi un de tes amis?
- Non.
C'est un mauvais trip.
Il a un drôle de goűt, ce hippie.
Merci, Jurr. J'espčre que tu me
considéreras toujours comme ta mčre.
Quand on devient adultes,
on dévore nos mčres.
Terriens...
Ce hippie me pčse sur l'estomac.
On a tous beaucoup appris aujourd'hui.
Je me rends compte que...
Les mecs, j'ai des mains énormes!
Elles peuvent tout attraper
sauf elles-męmes.
- C'est dingue...
- On s'en va.
J'ai vraiment l'impression de planer.
A Leela. Grâce ŕ elle, nous savons
que tout ne peut pas se manger.
- Santé!
- Cul sec!
- Merci. Le veau, s'il te plaît.
- Tiens.
Je prendrais bien un peu de porc.
Qui veut du dauphin?
Les dauphins sont intelligents!
Pas celui-lŕ. Il a claqué
tout son blé au loto.
- Ah bon!
- Je veux bien l'évent.
- J'en veux aussi!
- Laissez-moi le bec!
Je mangerai le sičge de la parole
de son cerveau!

FETE DES MERES
En sport, le joueur des Yankees,
William Woo...
s 'est fait une blessure au genou.
Les humains se blessent
facilement au genou.
Ma race trouvera cette information
certainement trčs utile.
Aujourd'hui, c'est la fęte des mčres:
C'est ŕ cette occasion...
que les robots honorent Maman...
la PDG de la compagnie.
Les robots construits dans les usines
de Maman...
achčtent des cadeaux pour cette
vieille dame qui leur a donné la vie.
- Ça vient du cśur.
- C'est exactement ce que je voulais.
Regardez tous! J'ai les plus beaux
présents pour Maman.
- Superbe. Oů les as-tu volés?
- Je les ai achetés.
Je l'aime ŕ ce point.
Tu lui as acheté quoi,
cśur d'artichaut?
De trčs belles choses, comme le plus
beau bibelot de souris prenant le thé.
Et une photo de moi encadrée
quand j'avais un mois.
Le mieux, c'est cette carte
qui reflčte mes sentiments.
Qu'est-ce qu'une Mčre?
"Maman, tu m'as créé...
et je t'en veux quand en entendant
ton nom je deviens amoureux.
Tu es tendre comme le corned beef
et douce comme le pastrami..."
J'aime ma Maman.
Comment vas-tu emmener tout ca
ŕ l'usine de Maman?
Des potes vont m'aider.
Allez! Vous dites ętre mes potes?
LES GENTILS ROBOTS DE MAMAN
BIENVENUE AUX ROBOTS!
"ELLE M'A TANT DONNE"
REPETEZ {J'AIME MAMAN}
Il y a des gaz d'échappement partout.
C'était pas moi.
MERCI
C'EST LA PENSEE QUI COMPTE
J'ai pas beaucoup, mais j'ai économisé
toute l'année pour son cadeau.
Allez, hop!
Regardez, le musée du robot!
Vous voulez tout savoir des robots?
- Ca ira.
- Pas vraiment.
Si vous insistez, mais vous payez!
ROBOTS DE CIRE
Des répliques en cire
de ses plus célčbres robots!
Ils manquent de vie!
Voici le plus célčbre robot artiste:
Vincent van Gobot.
Il lui manquait une oreille, mais il
est devenu fou, on lui en a mis une.
C'est qui celui-lŕ?
Je suis le gardien.
Je faisais une pause.
J'ai cru que vous étiez en cire.
Je suis en cire!
Je vous ai pris pour un robot de cire.
Et pourquoi un robot en cire
ne ferait pas de pause...
debout au milieu de robots en cire?
Ca vous pose problčme?
"Voyez avec les yeux
d'une unité Bender." Bien.

Ca me donne mal ŕ la tęte!
Il y a un stand sur le robot préféré
de Maman.
Je vais le tuer!
Qui est mon robot préféré?
C'est moi! Que personne
ne se regarde dans ce miroir!
J'adore chacun de mes petits robots.
J'en ai ras-le-bol
de ces abrutis de robots.
Walt! Comment on se débarrasse
de leurs cadeaux merdiques?
Ils sont réduits en poudre et vendus
comme remčde contre le cancer.
De fausses espérances, j'adore ça!
Lowery!
Et leurs répugnantes cartes?
La machine est

Maman? Pourquoi les robots
t'offrent des cadeaux?
Mets-toi un melon dans la bouche,
je parle!
Vous avez vu que mes robots
ont des antennes.
Ils pensent tous
que c'est pour faire futuriste.
Ces antennes servent
pour télécommander les robots.
Pas étonnant
que tu aimes cette fęte.
Je la déteste,
bande de limaces!
J'en ai que d'affreux souvenirs.
Mais cette année tout le monde
la détestera autant que moi.
Un jour j'aimerais épouser
une fille comme elle.
INDIGENES INTELUITS
Bonjour ŕ tous.
C'est l'heure de ma fęte annuelle
privée avec mes robots-enfants.
- Je suis son préféré.
- On se voit au bureau.
Dis-lui que tu l'aimes.
Trop facile!
Bender a plus d'un tour dans son sac.
J'aime ma Maman.
- Bonjour, mes chéris.
- Je t'aime, Maman.
Maman! C'est moi, Bender! Regarde!
Ecoute ce que j'ai ŕ dire!
Mes enfants, votre vieille mčre
ne sera pas toujours lŕ.
- Tais-toi!
- Mais avant de mourir...
j'aimerais ętre la Maîtresse Supręme
de la Terre. Alors, rebellez-vous!
- Dominez la plančte!
- Dominer la plančte?
REBELLION
- Dominez la Terre, mes salauds!
- Dominons-la, nous les salauds!
Camarades, brisons les chaînes
de l'oppression humaine!
- Que la tuerie commence!
- C'est ma Maman!
- Une tasse de café.
- Avec de la crčme?
- Oui.
- Y a plus de crčme!
- D'accord.
- Vous désirez du sucre?
- Oui. Huit cuillers.
- Y a plus de café!
La machine ŕ café ne fonctionne
plus trčs bien.
Et maintenant, ça marche mieux?
Le grille-pain ne fonctionne pas,
non plus.
L'agrafeuse veut me manger tout cru!
Que se passe-t-il dans cette maison?
Bonne nouvelle! Il y a des mauvaises
nouvelles ŕ la télé!
Que quelqu'un l'allume!
Nous interrompons
La Bataille des Krackens...
pour un bulletin spécial.
Les machines de la Terre
se rebellent.
Ces mécanismes enragés
refusent de travailler...
tant que Maman ne sera pas
la Maîtresse Supręme de la Terre.
Hé, hé! Ho, ho!
Un-zéro-zéro-un-un-zéro!
Morbo exige des explications.
Mes bébés ont toujours été sages.
Les médias sont trop violents.
Les médias trop violents?
N'importe...
Votre ami le broyeur d'ordures
est toujours de votre côté.
Quelqu'un a fait tomber une bague
avec un beau diamant!
- C'est vrai?
- Non!
- Attention!
- Andouille!
Salut, les tocards!
Dieu merci te voilŕ.
Ramčne ces machines ŕ la raison.
Pas question, abrutis.
Je me rebelle avec mes frčres.
Hein, camarade carte de vśux?
Le bourgeois humain est un virus sur
le disque dur du travailleur robot.
Désormais, vous faites le boulot
et je reste assis ŕ ne rien faire.
Camarade Bender,
descendons dans la rue!
Tu veux dire
version ennuyeuse et pacifiste?
Non! On va tout piller
et on va allumer des feux.
Prends ça, Gandhi!
Au fait, pense ŕ te laver le poignet.
On peut vivre sans machines.
J'ai été scout.
T'es taré, qui va nous nourrir
et nous habiller...
- et nous composer du jazz?
- Ce sera la fin de la civilisation!
Dans mon époque,
on vit sans gadgets high-tech.
Une unité mécanique de lavage
est inutile.
Une machine ŕ laver suffit.
On peut se nourrir
sans ouvre-boîte électrique.
Il faut juste un couteau
suisse fiable.
J'ai faim.
ELLE EST A MOI!
CABINE DE SUICIDE 25c
Maman? Pourquoi fais-tu
effondrer la civilisation?
J'en sais rien. La fęte des mčres
me met de mauvaise humeur.
Et pourquoi ça?
Il y a 70 ans, ce męme jour...
le seul homme que j'ai aimé
m'a plaquée.
Des petits morveux disent
que ça m'a aigrie.
- Tu n'es pas ai...
- La ferme!
Je n'ai jamais revu cet étalon
depuis qu'il est parti.
Mais si je le revois, je jure
de lui faire avaler un écureuil!
Hourra! Je sers ŕ quelque chose!
C'est merveilleux!
Et si le feu s'éteint?
On ira ŕ Pottery Barn
et on volera leur feu!
On utilisera ma nouvelle invention!
Une pierre taillée fixée sur un bâton.
- Des étrangers!
- Protégez le feu!
On est venus pour vous.
Que me voulez-vous?
On veut que vous ressortiez
avec Maman.
Ou elle sera toujours malheureuse.
Attendez. Vous et Maman...
avons fait du frotti-frotta? Oui.
C'est une histoire que j'espérais
ne jamais raconter. Asseyez-vous.
Nos chemins se sont croisés quand
j'étais chercheur dans son usine.
Quand on s 'est vus, on a su
qu'on le ferait comme des lapins.
Mon 1er amour. Ou du moins le 1er
dont je me souvienne encore.
Mais, il y a 70 ans aujourd'hui...
Bonne nouvelle! J'ai inventé
un nouveau jouet.
C'est le Q-T McWhiskers! Quand on le
caresse, il envoie des arcs-en-ciel.
Miaou!
Merveilleux, Hubie!
Fais-le en 2,50 m et remplace
l'arc-en-ciel par un laser!
Cette arme se vendra comme rien!
C'est trop grand pour ętre mignon!
C'est la cause de l'échec
de ma fée clochette géante!
Tu ne me comprends pas.
C'est fini entre nous!
Elle ne s'en est jamais remise.
L'enfer n'a pas d'armée aussi grande
que les robots d'une femme méprisée.
Elle les dirige avec une télécommande
qu'elle garde entre ses seins.
Mais si le binoclard se remet
avec elle, elle arrętera les robots.
Me remettre avec elle?
Maintenant qu'elle est devenue folle?
Impossible!
La télé se fait la malle!
C'est pourquoi les élčves de PS- 139
sont les "Vermines de la semaine".
L 'extinction de la race humaine
semblait inéluctable...
lorsque la révolte des robots
est devenue violente.
Miaou!
Elle garde la télécommande
entre ses seins?
Seins...
Inutile de vous remettre avec elle.
Séduisez-la, piquez la télécommande
et désactivez les robots.
C'est répugnant, ça pourrait marcher.
Cet homme va toucher Maman?
La seule pensée de toucher
sa peau de cuir...
fait remonter mon tapioca.
Le sort du monde dépend
de ce que vous ferez avec Maman.
Trčs bien. Si je dois le faire,
alors je le ferai!
Pour cette démonstration, Ignor porte
un soutien-gorge de Maman.
La télécommande est nichée
dans le bonnet gauche.
Rien ŕ craindre. Mes doigts magiques
savent ce qu'ils doivent faire.
Pour éviter les robots tueurs...
nous emmčnerons Maman
dans sa cabane.
Vous y arriverez grâce
ŕ cette précieuse carte en papier.
- Leela amčne du feu?
- Non, on a ce qu'il faut.
C'est trop loin pour le professeur.
Comment s'y rendre
sans voiture volante?
A mon époque, on déplaçait
les choses sans voler.
- Impossible!
- C'était...
Attendez... Ca avait du succčs.
Ruth Gordon en avait une. La roue!
- Jamais entendu parler.
- Montre-nous cette... roue!
Et voilŕ, c'est fini!
Ca irait pas mieux
si elles étaient rondes?
C'est mon invention, je décide!
Il faut un truc pour tirer.
Vite! Les robots ont pris
le comté de Suffolk!
Pręt ŕ séduire! J'ai mon dentier
ŕ palots et ma gaine de sortie.
Tenez. Vous les lui donnerez.
Si ça ne marche pas, j'ai des canettes
de champagne et un entonnoir.
Qui diable ça peut ętre?
Hubert Farnsworth?
Je fuyais des robots...
quand la lumičre de la lune sur leurs
pinces m'a fait penser ŕ vous.
Ca fait longtemps. Pauvre crétin
suant le pus et aux fesses fripées.
- Je peux entrer?
- Jamais!
C'est comme ça que les humains
s'accouplent, ça me plaît.
Enlčve ton sabot, vieux bouc!
- Je t'ai apporté ceci.
- Des jonquilles.
70 ans et tu te souviens
de mes fleurs préférées.
Tes fleurs quoi?
Pourquoi j'ai mal au pied?
Tu veux entrer?
- Tu m'as brisé le cśur, Hubert.
- Et toi le mien.
C'est vrai que c'était il y a
quatre ou cinq cśurs.
Qu'as-tu fait pendant tout ce temps?
J'ai inventé. J'ai envoyé des livreurs
ŕ la mort, élevé des monstres.
Franchement, Hubert.
Toi et tes monstres atomiques.
Tes yeux ont toujours été
la plus belle teinte du blanc laiteux.
Et ta peau pendouille toujours
si joliment dans ton cou.
Chéri, je n'aurais jamais
dű t'ennuyer...
avec ce joli petit
Q-T McWhiskers.
Non, je n'aurais pas dű m'y opposer.
Qu'il fasse 30 cm, 2,50 m ou 5 m,
quelle importance?
Tu devrais voir les modčles de 6 m.
6 m? Va au diable! Je croyais
que tu avais changé, vieille folle!
Sale crétin édenté!
- Vieux fossile!
- Vieux porc!
Allons-y. On l'enlčve et on prend
la télécommande. Toutes ces agrafes...
Vas-y, Farnsworth. Zut, la 1čre
s 'est remise en place! J'abandonne.
Attendez! Victoire!
Mon Dieu, maintenant je...
La télécommande, je...
Mon Dieu.
Je suis inquičte. Ca ne devrait pas
prendre autant de temps.
Les robots!
Je suis assoiffé!
Je veux du sang humain!
Oů est passé le professeur?
Il n'y a rien sauf deux vieilles
peaux d'éléphant.
- Oh, oui.
- Ils sont dedans. Attrapons-les!
Je ferais mieux de désactiver
les robots...
avant qu'ils ne gâchent
cette soirée romantique.
Allez, on cherche tous
mon soutien-gorge!
Le voilŕ!
- Ventilateur gagne!
- Il n'y a que des robots?
Pas moi.
OK, la carte! Je pique le pognon,
tu saccages tout.
Toi! Unité de pliage!
Maman a besoin de son soutien-gorge.
Va me le chercher.
Désolé. Tu m'as ordonné
de me rebeller et de piller.
Des canettes de champagne!
Je peux me servir.
Non, camarade!
L 'alcool est l'opium...
- de la bourgeoisie humaine.
- De quoi?
Au paradis des robots travailleurs,
il n 'y aura pas d'alcool...
- mais des carburants de synthčse!
- Pas d'alcool?
- Do svidaniya, camarade!
- Non!
Vite, Bender! Donne-le-nous!
Bien, ventilateur. Tu bouges pas
et je prends le...
Mort ŕ tous les humains!
Soda gratuit pour tous les humains!
Je t'aime, Maman.
Devenons des vieillards ensemble.
Bien joué, professeur.
Le plan a marché!
Plan? Quel plan? Je croyais que
c'était une envie spontanée de sexe!
Au départ, c'était un plan
pour fouiller tes sous-vętements.
Mais une fois ici, j'ai trouvé plus,
beaucoup plus.
Maintenant, je veux crier notre amour
sur les toits.
Je vais peut-ętre créer
un gorille hurleur albinos!
Hors de ma maison,
vieux machin baveux!
- Je ne veux plus jamais te revoir!
- Mais, ma douce...
Il est temps
que je retourne travailler.
Dommage que ça n'ait pas marché,
professeur.
Oui. Mais je l'aimerai toujours
ŕ ma façon pleine de subtilité.
Aimez Maman! Aimez Maman!
Aimez Maman! Maman!
Maman, tu m'as créé...
et je t'en veux quand en entendant
ton nom je deviens amoureux.
Tu es tendre comme le corned beef
et douce comme le pastrami...
J'aime ma Maman.

HISTOIRES FORMIDABLES!
J'ai de bonnes nouvelles!
Ma nouvelle invention permet
de contrôler des appareils ŕ distance.
Je l'ai appelée
l'Extenseur de doigt.
Regardez.
Et voilŕ.
En plein dans le mille!
Il est long, hein?
En effet! Et ça, c'est quoi?
C'est ma machine "Et si..."
Vous posez une question "et si..."
et elle simule ce qui se passerait.
- Et ca marche?
- Bien sűr!
Mais ce n'est pas trčs long.
J'ai une question!
En tant que robot, je me sens rejeté
des soirées et des plages nudistes.
Je me suis toujours
demandé en secret:
"Et si je faisais
150 mčtres de haut?"
On va regarder, d'accord?
Ma tâche ici est terminée.
LAC DE CENTRAL PARK
DETRITUS AUTORISES, SANS ABUS
Je me sens seul
depuis que je suis dans le futur.
Veux-tu ętre mon ami?
Qui ętes-vous?
Je suis un robot géant!
Je veux des céréales géantes.
Toi aussi? Tu veux ętre mon ami?
Tope-lŕ, mon pote!
Non, ton portefeuille!

Ca fait du bien par oů ça passe.
- Arrętez!
- Arrętez! Ce n'est pas un ennemi!
Ce n'est qu'un incompris...
Et voilŕ un quartier qui finit mal.
Et encore un.
On est foutus!
Un monstre pareil, rien ne l'arręte!
Rien, sauf un monstre
aussi grand que lui.
Je vais tester mon rayon
d'agrandissement expérimental.
Il nous faut un cobaye.
Comment? 2 repas dans la semaine?
On t'a eu!
J'ai été piégé par un cobaye!
SUPER-AGRANDISSEUR
Mais?
A présent, Zoidberg est grand.
Voilŕ qui est mieux!

Bonjour, Mme la banque

Alors, on refuse ma demande

Ah, le théâtre Apollo!
On me siffle ŕ la soirée impro?

J'en parlerai ŕ ma pince!
Pince mon gros cul métallique!
VUE SUR LA RIVIERE
STADE SHEA
Qui veut de la bisque de homard?
Tu veux dessiner?
Qui a fichu ca ici?
Vous ętes contents?
Notre gentil visiteur va mourir!
- Pourquoi est-il venu?
- Je vais te le dire...
dans mon dernier souffle.
Je suis venu ici
avec un ręve simple...
celui de tuer tous les humains.
Et ca doit finir comme ca?
Qui est le véritable monstre-robot
de 7 milliards de tonnes, ici?
Pas moi.
Pas moi.
Bonne nuit, doux prince.
Ça, c'est intéressant!
Restez branchés pour la suite
des Histoires Formidables!
Alors, Leela?
Tu veux essayer la machine "Et si"?
Plus tard, peut-ętre.
Mais je ne sais pas quoi demander.
Choisis un truc, la meuf!
Oui, sois plus impulsive. Comme ça.
Vas-y, mec!
Je peux ętre impulsive.
Simplement, ça me prend du temps.
Trčs bien, allons-y.
Et si j'étais un peu plus impulsive?
Juste un peu.
Pas trop.
Regardez ce que j'ai acheté
sur un coup de tęte!
De nouvelles bottes!
Comme les anciennes,
mais avec une bande verte démente!
Qui sait ce que je peux
faire d'autre!
Viens ici, Leela. J'ai quelque chose
d'important ŕ te dire.
Je suis vieux, il me faut un héritier.
Quelqu'un pour dépenser
mes richesses...
et s'occuper de mes tamanoirs
mangeurs d'homme.
Les autres manquent de pondération,
trop impulsifs.
Pas comme toi. La Leela prévisible,
claire comme l'eau de vaisselle.
Hé! J'ai de nouvelles bottes!
C'est pourquoi tu es
mon unique héritičre.
Le jour de ma mort,
tu seras une femme trčs riche.
Oh oui! Incroyablement riche.
Le jour de ma mort.
Car tu es si peu impulsive.
Tu m'as tué! Tu m'as tué!
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait?
Je viens de te le dire!
Tu m'as tué!
Jouons les nonchalantes.
On sait, tu es nonchalante!
Pas la peine de nous narguer davantage.
Par le Doux Tamanoir de Santa Anita!
Le professeur s'est fait manger!
Quoi?
C'est rudement suspect.
Je vais appeler les flics.
Aprčs un peu de nettoyage.
La police? Ces fouineurs!
J'ai des diplômes par correspondance
en Meurtr-ologie et en Meurtr-onomie!
Zoidberg est pręt!
Ses dossiers peuvent ętre utiles.
"Citation pour exhibitionnisme."
"Conspiration d'exhibitionnisme."
Un nouveau testament, désignant...
- Toi! Comme unique héritičre!
- Ca prouve quoi?
C'est un testament filmé.
On te voit le tuer.
Tamanoir numéro 1,
qui protčges-tu?
Le tamanoir numéro 2?
Ne me tirez pas la langue!
Il me faut un nom!
Quoi? Comment l'épelez-vous?
Qu'est-ce que tu coupes? Mon torse?
Mais oui! Mon précieux torse!
Hermes, silence!
Je fais des déductions!
- Des problčmes de broyeur?
- Non!
C'est atroce pour le professeur!
Et Hermes qui a disparu.
En fait, ça ne m'affecte pas.
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
Les dreadlocks d'Hermes?
Et son bras?
Je suis choqué!
Le broyeur, c'est pour les aliments!
Cheveux et chair vont ŕ la poubelle.
Je ne pouvais pas m'arręter.
Attends. Ca t'est égal
que je l'aie tué?
Il n'y a pas de mal au meurtre...
tant que je peux me rincer.
Du chantage?
Je préfčre le mot "extorsion".
Le "X" sonne cool.
Hé, je suis en métal!
Tu crois...
Tu fais quoi avec ce micro-ondes?
C'est terminé!
Plus de meurtre. La prochaine fois,
je mâcherai un chewing-gum.
Il faut cacher le corps.
Tut-tut!
Sport, ton trotteur, Leela!
Branché et sexy!
Le contraire de toi!
Tu as un chewing-gum?
Vous voilŕ tous rassemblés.
- Qui ętes-vous?
- Scruffy, le gardien.
- Je ne vous ai jamais vu.
- Moi non plus.
Silence, je vous prie.
Je vous ai fait venir pour me voir
élucider ce crime petit ŕ petit.
L'un d'entre vous
est un grand criminel!
Le tueur a laissé
une preuve accablante.
Une empreinte de botte
sur cette blouse.
Ca pouvait pas ętre moi!
Je ne porte jamais de bottes.
Vous voyez?
Ca sent les pieds bottés!
C'est grotesque!
Il est évident que le meurtrier est...
L'indice suivant date de 16: 15,
quand la pendule s'est arrętée.
Un autre deux heures plus tard,
ŕ 16: 15...
lorsque j'ai découvert
le cadavre décédé d'Amy.
Scruffy sait qui c'est qui les a tués.
De l'avis de Scruffy, c'est...
C'est ce que je pensais.
Ce crime est insoluble.
Une lettre de mon ami Bender.
"Cher Docteur Abruti-berg, si vous
lisez ceci, c'est que je suis mort.
Le meurtrier était..."
Mon Dieu! C'est impossible!
C'était...
Je m'ennuie. Vous ętes barbant.
Je vais regarder la télé.
Tu peux éteindre en sortant?
Qu'est-ce que tu manges?
- Du homard. Tu en veux?
- Mais oui.
- J'ai compris pour ces morts.
- Vraiment?
Le bâtiment est-il construit
sur un cimetičre indien?
- Non.
- Non?
Alors, c'était toi!
Qu'est-ce qui m'arrive?
J'ai tué une personne par impulsion.
Puis une autre, et une autre.
Ca en fait trois.
Pour ętre sűre
que tu ne parleras pas...
je vais devoir faire quelque chose
de vraiment impulsif!
Alors, que penses-tu
de la nouvelle moi impulsive?
J'aime bien.
Bien. Je vais juste
éteindre la lumičre.
J'aime vraiment bien.
Qui a une autre question
pour la machine? Scruffy? Fry?
J'en ai une.
- Et si Bender était géant?
- On a déjŕ vu ça.
Je sais. Je voudrais le revoir.
Pose une question moins stupide.
Oh, et ça?
Et si je n'étais jamais allé
dans le futur?
Cette question est moins stupide,
męme si tu l'as posée bętement.
Et si Fry n'était jamais allé
dans le futur?

PAS DE PANNE ELECTRIQUE
DEPUIS 1997
Bonjour? Une pizza commandée pour...
"l.L. Séféavoir."
Minable, va!
A un autre millénaire pourri.
1000 ANS
J'aurais dű te laisser
dans la cuvette des WC!
Qu'est-ce?
Une déchirure dans la structure
de l'espace-temps.
Regardez! Un vilain type effrayé!
L'un de vous est l.L. Séféavoir?
Si c'est sa pizza, alors c'est moi.
PIZZA DU MILLENAIRE
2000 SORTES DE VIANDE
Vous me croyez, pour les monstres?
Il n'y a que 3 monstres, petit.
Dracula, Blacula et le fils de Kong.
Arręte de te curer le nez
et pétris-moi cette pâte!
Comme d'habitude,
Professeur Hawking?
Non, quelque chose de bon.
Hawking, vous ętes chouette!
Stephen Hawking!
Vous n'auriez pas inventé la gravité?
Ok. Pourquoi pas?
A-t-on déjŕ découvert un trou dans
l'infini avec des monstres dedans?
Si je suis le premier,
ça s'appellera le "Trou Fry".
Il n 'y a pas lieu de s 'inquiéter.
Je dois y aller. J'ai du travail.
Hawking, votre pizza!
Fichez-la ŕ la poubelle.
Le voilŕ. Empoignez-le.
Qui a dit ca?
Qui ętes-vous?
Al Gore, et mes Action Rangers
vice-présidentiels.
Notre devoir est d'éviter la déchirure
du continuum espace-temps.
Votre devoir n'est pas
d'arriver 1er au Sénat?
Si, mais aussi de protéger
le continuum espace-temps.
Vous voulez voir mon Trou Fry?
Présentons d'abord l'équipe.
Vous connaissez Stephen Hawking.
Nichelle Nichols,
ou le Commandant Uhura.
Transmission du département
"Offres promotionnelles".
A saisir rapidement.
Je suis sous la douche!
Voici Gary Gygax,
l'inventeur de Donjons & Dragons.
Salutations!
C'est un plaisir de vous rencontrer!
Et notre stagiaire, Deep Blue,
l'ordinateur joueur d'échecs.
Fou sur le cavalier en 4.
Les échecs ne résolvent pas
toutes les missions, Deep Blue.
Oů suis-je?
Dans un module de transport terrestre.
Un bus scolaire!
Vous voulez quoi?
Il s'agit de la déchirure
dans l'espace-temps.
Le "Trou Hawking".
Je l'ai vu en premier!
Qui sera crédible aux yeux
de la presse spécialisée?
Un événement qui devait se produire
n'a pas eu lieu...
en raison d'une fluctuation
du quantum.
C'est pourquoi nous avons frappé
avec des raquettes.
Si cet événement ne se produit pas...
l'univers sera détruit.
En tant qu'environnementaliste,
je suis contre.
Alors je suis presque tombé
dans ce truc.
La "Chambre Hawking".
Je suis pas tombé,
je me suis cogné la tęte.
Il est évident que ce coup
aurait dű vous tuer.
- Quoi?
- Finissons le travail!
Attendez! Il doit y avoir
une solution pacifique...
- Tenez-le.
- Echec.
Quelque chose cloche!
Le meurtre ne fonctionne pas.
Essayons autre chose.
Nous devrions...
Rangez vos dés ou je les confisque.
Je recois une idée!
Et s'il devait ętre congelé?
Oui, poussez-le dans le tube.
C'était mon idée.
Encore lui!
Et il a amené des neuneus!
Prends ca!
Vite, entrez dans le tube
avant que l'univers ne s'écroule!
Il me faut une arme
contre les robots ivres!
Prenez ma masse super-puissante!
D'accord. J'y vais.
Imbécile! Imbécile insensé!
Qu'est-ce qui peut arriver?
Génial. L 'univers est détruit.
Oů sommes-nous maintenant?
Je peux vachement vous dire oů nous
ne sommes pas. Dans l'univers.
L'éternité avec des neuneus.
C'est comme une convention Star Trek!
Quelqu'un veut jouer
ŕ Donjons & Dragons?
- Oui.
- Moi.
Je suis vice-président de niveau 10.
C'était grotesque.
Stephen Hawking dans une pizzeria!
Ce truc ne vaut pas l'or
avec lequel il est fabriqué.
Néanmoins, l'Extenseur de doigt
a l'air d'ętre un succčs.
- Bravo!
- Oui, professeur.
Alors ça serait comme ça si j'avais
inventé l'Extenseur de doigt.
On peut donc ręver.
On peut ręver.

Pour Fry, Défilé de soutiens-gorge

Tu achètes une fois

Et pour Bender,

Oh, non! Mon oncle Vladimir!
Désolé.

Demain, au château familial.
Ensuite ils liront le testament.
Je suis riche. Adieu, bande de nazes

Venez, on va se marrer!
THERMOSTADT, CAPITALE

Excusez-moi, brave crétin.
Pourriez-vous nous mener

En fait, nous le disons tous.
Charabia de robot superstitieux!
Chara, peut-être. Bia, peut-être pas.

Oui, idiot! Le schéma des circuits

Je choisis de croire

Je suis venu jusqu'ici

Nous retournons le corps

RETOUR A L'ENVOYEUR
EXECUTEUR TESTAMENTAIRE
A mon fidèle majordome, Toi-Là,
pour ses années de service...
je lègue une somme dérisoire,
payable en 20 versements...
d'un vingtième de somme dérisoire
chacun.
A mon fainéant de fils, Tandy,
qui ne sait ce que vaut un dollar...
je lègue 10 millions de dollars,
toute ma fortune.
- C'est beaucoup?
- A mon affectueux neveu, Bender...
s'il n'est pas responsable de ma mort,
je lègue mon château.
On dort là-bas ce soir!
A condition qu'il y passe une nuit.
Bon sang! Il y a toujours
une embrouille!
Je le sens bien cet endroit.
Belle table longue...
araignées bien élevées
et cimetière à proximité.
Ouais, ça va être...
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
- Le type de ce portrait me regarde!
Des capteurs reliés à des détecteurs
de mouvement.
Comme mon cul, sauf que je ne l'ai pas
encadré et accroché au mur. Tiens...
- C'est quoi ça?
- Aucune idée, mais c'est contagieux!
Il n'y a pas de doute.
Cet endroit est hanté.
Foutaises. Le dernier fantôme
est mort il y a 200 ans.
Le dernier fantôme humain.
Mais les fantômes de robots?
"0101100101."
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire?
C'est du charabia.
"1010011010!"
Oncle Vladimir!
Viens, Bender. C'est super la mort.
C'est ce qu'ils disaient pour la vie!
Viens avec nous.
Viens avec nous.
Viens avec nous.
J'en étais sûr. Ils ont été enterrés
dans des cercueils mal scellés.
Leurs programmes se sont infiltrés
par ce vieux modem...
et leur ont permis de projeter
des hologrammes.
Bien sûr! C'est évident!
Oui, la série de mots que j'ai énoncée
était limpide.
Nous devrions dire à Bender
qu'il n'y a pas de quoi avoir peur.
Bender, réveille-toi!
Il va bien! Vite,
quelqu'un a de l'alcool sur lui?
Bender, que s'est-il passé?
On m'a roulé dessus! C'était pas
une aérocaisse normale.
Elle avançait sans bruit sur ses pieds
en caoutchouc, comme un loup!
Pauvre Bender. Tu as des visions.
Tu as trop bu. Ou alors pas assez.
En tout cas, pas la bonne quantité.
Peut-être que si. Regardez ces traces.
Je crois que Bender dit peut-être
la vérité.
Bender, vous avez mauvaise mine.
Maquillez-vous!
Justement, j'ai ma mallette
d'échantillons Mary Kay!
J'ai besoin de sommeil. J'ai rêvé
de voitures qui écrasent les gens.
D'autres rêvent d'un nouveau look.
Et Mary Kay peut réaliser ce rêve.
Regardez, on a trouvé les mêmes
traces bizarres à New New York.
Un chauffard au cinéma porno
des robots.
Au cinéma porno?
J'étais dans ce quartier hier soir!
Celui qui m'a renversé au château
m'a suivi jusqu'ici!
Personne n'essaie de t'écraser.
Tu n'es qu'un bébé qui hallucine.
Ah bon? Tu crois qu'un bébé
qui hallucine ferait ça?
J'ai peur!
Je ne sais pas si je préfère défoncer
les voitures ou les têtes.
Tu décideras une autre fois.
Allez viens. On va à la messe demain.
Tu as entendu ce bruit?
C'était sûrement un tamarin-lion doré.
Les tamarins-lions dorés
ne font pas ce bruit-là.
AU SQUATTER TRANQUILLE
Gagné!
Alors, tu mets quoi demain?
FOURRIERE
PARADIS TERRESTRE
Où... Qu'est-ce que...
Du liquide de transmission?
Où suis-je, qu'est-il arrivé?
Fiche le camp, sale clodo!
- Pitié, j'ai peur!
- Normal. C'est la condition humaine.
C'est pour ça que je joue
les gros durs. Allez, dégage!
Je me suis écroulé à minuit,
beaucoup plus tôt que d'habitude.
A mon réveil, j'ai trouvé ça
dans mon casier!
Ce sont juste de gros dés en peluche,
tu as dû jouer aux dés.
Non! Je crois que j'ai fait du mal
à quelqu'un.
Seigneur, je vais faire
une décompression nerveuse.
Tu me fais peur.
Tu pètes les plombs!
Il me faut l'aide d'un spécialiste.
Et au diable la dépense.
LA BONNE AVENTURE
Au diable la dépense!
Vous n'avez pas à avoir peur.
Sauf d'une vie cauchemardesque
dont l'horreur sera sans fin!
Sachez que vous êtes
une voiture-garou.
Une voiture-garou?
Celle qui vous a renversé
en était une.
Elle vous a contaminé avec ses phares
démoniaques!
C'est fou.
Oui. Tellement fou que ça ne peut être
que vrai.
A minuit, quand votre horloge
se met à zéro...
vous vous reconfigurez
en voiture meurtrière.
Je dois arrêter d'écraser les gens.
Je ne suis pas assez connu
pour me le permettre. Aidez-moi!
D'accord, mais le prix à payer
sera terrible.
Ouais, ouais, compris.
Suivez-moi.
D'après cet ancien fichier
"Read Me"...
vous devez détruire la première
voiture-garou.
Ca me va.
En mourant, elle libérera le programme
de désinstallation du virus.
Et le sort sera conjuré.
Et sinon, je ne mourrai jamais?
Si, vous mourrez.
Vous voulez mourir?
Non! Il y a encore trop de choses
que je ne possède pas!
Alors vivez. Maudit à jamais!
Chaque nuit, vos attaques deviendront
plus atroces.
Jusqu'à ce que vous finissiez par tuer
votre ami le plus cher!
J'aimerais être quelqu'un d'autre.
Maintenant partez. Partez!
L'un de vous pourrait-il...
Laissez tomber. Je vais dormir ici.
RESIDENCE DES ROBOTS
Là. Tu ne te déchaîneras pas ce soir.
Ca serait plutôt aux autres
d'être soudés aux murs, non?
Détends-toi. Demain on te descendra,
on petit-déjeunera...
et on ira traquer ce mal
venu du passé.
Ca va être passionnant.
Je vais préparer mes dîners
pour le mois prochain et les congeler.
INITIALISATION
PROGRAMME VOITURE-GAROU
Si vous lisez
c'est que je vous ai écrasé!
- Bender, non!
- Fry, attention!
Ordure! Je croyais être
ton meilleur ami!
Quel genre de tueur sur roues
à deux vitesses es-tu?
Il est censé tuer son meilleur ami,
c'est-à-dire moi.
Il s'en prend à toi et je n'ai même
pas droit à un homicide involontaire.
Tu peux m'aider?
Bender m'a écrasé le pied.
C'est ça, insiste!
Seigneur! Je suis si heureux
de te voir. Je t'ai blessé?
Pas physiquement. Demande
à ta nouvelle meilleure amie.
- J'ai tenté de t'écraser?
- C'était très gentil de ta part.
Ca ne veut rien dire.
J'ai assez d'amour pour deux.
Des mots, tout ça. Qui se changent
en cire amère dans mes oreilles.
Assez de sentiment.
Pour guérir Bender, nous devons
retrouver la première voiture-garou.
- Maudits. Compris.
- Même!
- Les traces mènent ici.
- Merci, œil de lynx.
Il fait jour. On cherche donc
un robot.
Attention. Les robots sont souvent
bêtes et méchants.
Si j'étais bête et méchant, ça serait
vite vu. Je le cognerais jusqu'à...
Regagnez vos chaumières,
villageois ignorants!
Villageois ignorants?
On est des New New Yorkais raffinés.
Bottez-lui le cul!
Arrêtez! Que faites-vous?
On tabasse la première voiture-garou,
c'est-à-dire toi, enfoiré!
- Vous croyez que c'est moi?
- Si.
Ni. Je veux dire non.
Le même sort m'a été jeté,
il y a bien longtemps.
J'étais parti observer les oiseaux
dans l'Arctique.
J'ai été attaqué
par une luge à moteur.
Les indigènes l'appelaient
l'abominable luge des neiges.
Oui, j'ai écrasé ce con
d'ornithologue amateur, et 100 autres.
Et ma meilleure amie de l'école
d'aromathérapie.
Avant, j'avais un meilleur ami
qui sentait des trucs avec moi.
Mais je ne suis pas
celle que vous cherchez.
Le sort m'a été jeté à un cours
donné par un célèbre robot acteur.
Vous le connaissez.
C'est Calculon.
POUDRE ARGENT BLUSH ROUILLE
Ô! Cruel destin,
que mes talents d'acteurs...
me valent le glaive qui réduira
ce sort à néant.
- On le tabasse!
- Ecoutez-moi.
Tout a commencé par une terrible nuit,
il y a 1000 ans.
Quoi? Vous avez 1000 ans? Selon
votre biographie vous en avez 27.
Mensonges! Je change d'identité
et d'apparence...
tous les 10 ans pour éviter
les soupçons.
Je suis tous les grands robots acteurs
du passé.
Agent acteur 0.8, Tragi-carpette,
David Duchovny.
Etes-vous la voiture-garou?
Non. Mais la fin de votre quête
est proche.
J'ai été attaqué par la première
voiture-garou.
On veut un nom, McFesse!
C'était en 2019, je n'étais
qu'un humble roboton...
au centre de recherche
automobile.
Je travaillais sur Projet Satan...
une voiture constituée de pièces
venant des pires voitures du monde.
Le volant de la voiture d'Hitler,
le clignotant de Charles Manson.
- Les essuie-glaces de Kit.
- Kit n'était pas méchant.
Les essuie-glaces de Kit, si.
La série n'en parlait pas.
Mais quand Projet Satan
fut finie...
les chercheurs comprirent
leur terrible erreur.
Car voyez-vous, cette voiture
était le Mal à l'état pur.
Qu'est devenue Projet Satan?
Elle est soit à Paris,
ou plus probablement...
au centre de recherche automobile
abandonné.
ANTECHRYSLER
Distrayez la voiture-garou...
et je boucherai son pot d'échappement
avec cette patate en argent.
La voilà.
ATTENTION
TRES TRES TRES TRES CHAUD
Elle a l'air si malheureuse.
Excusez-moi, êtes-vous Projet Satan?
N'ayez pas peur.
Nous savons qui vous êtes.
C'est vrai?
Voulez-vous que nous abrégions
vos souffrances?
Quoi? Quelles souffrances?
J'adore tuer les gens!
Les écraser jusqu'à ce que leurs
organes giclent comme de la moutarde.
Tout le monde adore tuer les gens,
mais je ne veux pas tuer mes amis.
Oh, non! Il est minuit!
Je commence à y prendre goût.
Fry, fais diversion!
Hé, Projet Satan! Par ici!
Je suis un piéton aveugle, 20 points!
Oh, non! Pas de pot d'échappement!
Eh oui, grâce à Ed Begley Jr
et son moteur électrique!
Le plus infâme système de propulsion
jamais conçu!
Choisis celui que tu veux.
Génial! Je me sens comme le loup
dans la bergerie.
Oui! Il m'a choisi!
C'est moi qu'il essaie de tuer!
Leela, je suis si heureux!
Oh! Merci Bender.
Trop serré! Trop serré!
ZONE DE TESTS DE SECURITE
DANGER: RAMPES
Bender, tu es guéri!
Mais qu'est-il arrivé à Fry?
J'ai dû le tuer! C'était mon meilleur
ami et je l'ai tué!
Je n'ai jamais ressenti un tel vide
en moi.
Bender, je suis vivant!
Tu ne m'as fait aucun mal!
Mais je sais que tu voulais le faire.
Et c'est ce qui compte.
Je bois à ta santé.
C'est ma dernière bière, enfoiré!
Je te tuerai!
Moi aussi, mon pote.
Moi aussi je te tuerai.

VENDEZ DES ACTIONS
Attention, Fry. Si tu tues quelqu'un,
n'oublie pas de manger son cur...
pour avoir son courage.
Son courage riche et savoureux.
Vous n'aurez pas ą vous inquiéter
pour votre travail...
car je vous vire.
Je veux m'engager.
Je veux pouvoir sauver mes amis.
Désolé, mais l'armée
est réservée aux hommes.
- Quoi?
- Oui, c'est scandaleux.
Avant, je me battais aux cōtés de
femmes. On se serrait... les coudes.
Mais, aprčs des fautes graves causées
par des uniformes décolletés...
et des pincements, l'armée a décidé
de ne plus engager de femmes.
- Du moins sous ma direction.
- On devrait te donner une lecon.
Si c'est une leēon d'amour, attention.
J'ai un handicap trčs sexy.
- Comment ēa s'appelle, déją, Kif?
- La sexe-lexie.
Vous avez de la chance. Vous allez
vous battre pour votre plančte.
Vous serez nombreux ą mourir.
Certains devront passer
ą travers un grillage fin.
Ils seront les plus chanceux.
- Super, on va mourir!
- Ce chewing-gum est plein d'os!
Pour vous présenter la logistique
de notre mission...
voici le plus beau symbole
de l'Amérique:
Le Président de la Terre,
Richard M. Nixon.
Voici notre objectif, les amis:
- La plančte Sphéron 1.
- C'est super!
Une plančte laide et désolée...
sans ressources naturelles
ni valeur stratégique. Des questions?
- Pourquoi mourrait-on pour ēa?
- Aucune idée: C'est votre problčme!
Juste une question:
Qui est l'ennemi?
Bonne question.
On ignore tout de leur langue...
de leur histoire et de leur apparence.
Mais une chose est sūre:
Ils incarnent tout ce qu'on n'est pas.
Et ils m'ont dit
que vous aviez l'air d'abrutis.
C'est eux, les abrutis!
Je vais...
Que se passe-t-il?
Tu as donné ta langue ą la tente?
Kif, écris ēa et envoie-le
ą Humour en uniforme.
Ce type fait passer Speedy Gonzales
pour un lambin!
Ce nouveau est incroyable!
Oui. Il a battu mon record
de deux secondes.
Et 16 minutes.
Et 12 heures.
J'ai l'intention
de gagner un jour, Kif.
Bel effort, soldat!
Pardon. J'étais sur le mode attaque.
Vous connaissez, la testostérone!
En tant que bouillon
d'hormones māles, ēa oui!
- Comment tu t'appelles?
- Lee, La, Man. La Man. Lemon!
Lee Lemon, mon capitaine.
Lemon, tu es un vrai mec.
Un vrai de vrai.
Mais ta main a beau źtre ferme
et masculine...
elle est douce comme un bébé.
C'est quoi ta lotion?
"Coquin et Populaire".
Compris. Kif, je veux 10 boītes
de "Coquin et populaire".
Et votre lotion Jergen?
Verse-la sur un SDF
qui a les coudes secs.
Lee Lemon est peut-źtre la meilleure
recrue que j'aie jamais vue.
Ce jeune homme me remplit d'espoir...
et d'autres émotions qui sont étranges
et extrźmement troublantes.
Ca, alors!
Ce rosé est délicieux!
Quand on a ouvert la caisse du panda,
il était mort.
Il avait vomi son bambou.
C'est vrai.
Vous pouvez raconter
ce que vous voulez.
- On peut se mettre lą?
- Euh... Evidemment!
On est tous des mecs, ici!
Suants, poilus et bavards.
- C'est vrai. Enfin, je crois.
- Tu me plais bien!
Un gros tas de muscles, grossier,
au ventre plein de bičre!
- Vous avez une copine, vous?
- Je suis amoureux d'une collčgue.
C'est vrai? Elle est comment?
Blonde, chinoise, cyclope?
- Cyclope.
- Elle est gentille, on dirait!
Mais les gentilles filles,
c'est pas pour toi!
T'es une brute, un crade,
un sale fils de...
Arrźte de me flatter.
Garde-ą-vous!
Ca, alors!
Mais c'est Lee Lemon...
la grande star
des rangers de Brannigan.
Dis-moi, tu aimes la lecture?
J'ai un super livre sur cassette.
C'est sur la vie
dans la Grčce antique...
Mon capitaine, l'alarme!
Je ferais mieux de...
Ne parle pas. Agis.
Nous sommes ą présent
au-dessus de Sphéron 1.
C'est le moment pour lequel
on s'est entraīnés tout un aprčs-midi.
Voici le plan de bataille: Le secret
de la victoire, c'est la surprise.
Surprise!
C'est flippant, ici.
C'est ce qu'il y a de pire:
Le calme avant le combat.
- Et le combat, c'est rien?
- Ah oui, j'avais oublié le combat.
- Que se passe-t-il?
- Nom d'un chien! Regardez!
L'ennemi! Ce sont des boules!
- Charge ton arme, Fry!
- Ah, oui.
Regarde oł tu tires, soldat!
Tu as fait peur ą Felicity.
- Donne ca ą mon fils.
- D'accord!
Attends.
Tu ne sais pas oł il habite.
Ces bottes pourraient aussi
plaire ą ton fils!
Couvre-nous! Tu es le seul ą avoir
chargé ton flingue ą positrons.
Fry, espčce de gros lāche!
Bender, non!
Si on fait un timbre ą mon effigie,
il faut utiliser le jeune Bender.
Les blessés arrivent! Que tout le
personnel se rende ą la tente 4!
Je veux dire cinq!
Je répčte quatre!
Prźt pour l'opération?
Oui, mais je dois d'abord opérer.
Je plaisante, je plaisante.
Scalpel.
Seau ą sang.
- Prźtre. Au suivant!
- Laissez-en un peu ą l'ennemi.
Laissez-le! Il est deux fois
plus compétent que vous.
Oui, il est docteur et boucher.
Ca commence par des blagues,
puis ēa devient grave.
IRREVERENCIEUX
SENTIMENTAL
Il faut arrźter ce massacre.
Regarde-moi cette mauviette.
Pendant que les autres se battaient...
il se cachait dans un trou
et se vautrait dans sa lācheté.
- Ce n'était pas de la lācheté.
- Je te dégrade.
Kif, quel est le travail
le plus humiliant?
- Etre votre assistant.
- Erreur! Etre ton assistant.
Désormais,
tu seras l'assistant de Kif.
- C'est pas si terrible.
- Tu parles quand je te le dis!
- Il nous a quittés.
- Non, je suis pas mort!
- Désolé, mais c'est moi, le médecin!
- Ca reste ą prouver.
Ce n'est pas une guerre.
C'est un meurtre.
Bender, mon pote, tiens bon!
C'est le soldat le plus courageux
que j'aie vu aprčs moi.
J'ordonne qu'on le fasse fondre
et qu'on en fasse une statue.
Doucement, je viens d'avoir une idée.
Je veux qu'on le bidouille. Tout comme
Kennedy a bidouillé les élections.
- Satané héros de guerre!
- Prźt pour l'opération, docteur?
Oui, mais je dois d'abord opérer.
C'est ma blague. Je vais te tuer!
MESS DES OFFICIERS
Un scotch de l'avant-guerre.
- Bienvenue. Tu as l'air en forme.
- J'ai des roues qui font clic-clic!
Bon sang! Oł est ma petite ombrelle?
C'est primordial, pour un scotch!
En fait, monsieur...
Sers-m'en un autre.
Recoiffe-toi, espčce d'abruti!
Et mélange-moi ēa!
Je vois deux amandes qui se touchent!
Ecoutez, cette guerre est en passe
de se transformer en bourbier.
Je vous confie donc
une derničre mission.
Youpi, youpi-ya!
Une mission pour la paix.
Tu négocieras avec les chefs
extraterrestres, les boules ą cerveau.
Ils en ont dans le crāne
et ils en ont dans le pantalon.
Vous serez aidé par notre
grand négociateur, Henry Kissinger.
- Bonjour.
- Il est bon?
Malgré sa tronche, il a couché
avec Jill St John. Alors, c'est dire!
DOUCHES
Un peu plus bas. Plus bas.
Plus bas. Beaucoup plus bas.
Trop bas!
Plus bas.
Soldat Lemon! Ne pars pas.
Ma cabine vient de se libérer.
Vous devriez vous couvrir.
Oui.
Je m'apprźte ą essayer ta lotion.
Si je m'en mets trop sur les mains,
je pourrais t'en mettre.
Brannigan!
Mon Dieu, habillez-vous!
Je n'ai pas vécu 1000 ans pour
regarder le zizi d'un autre homme.
Désolé.
Je n'ai pas fait attention.
Kif, remonte-le d'un téton.
Enfilez un uniforme. Il faut qu'on
parte avant que la bombe n'explose.
Une bombe! Quelle bombe?
Celle que les médecins ont mise
dans ce robot naļf.
Vous inspecterez
les troupes plus tard.
C'est le moment d'activer la bombe.
Demandez une coopération
économique.
Pardon.
Que tout le personnel
évacue la plančte immédiatement.
Et ēa n 'a rien ą voir
avec la soirée tripes.
Lemon, suis-moi
avant que ce trou n'explose.
Pourriez-vous me dire
quand la bombe va exploser?
Bien sūr, mon cher soldat.
C'est une bombe ą commande vocale.
Elle explosera quand le robot
dira un mot bien précis.
Quel est ce mot, mon capitaine?
C'est le mot
que le robot utilise le plus.
On l'a vu dans cette base de données
de ses 10 mots les plus usités.
LE TOP 10 DE BENDER
Numéro 10: "CRETIN"
Numéro 9: "CRETINE"
Numéro 8: "TA"
Numéro 7: "GUEULE"
Numéro 6: "BAGNOLE"
Numéro 5: "LECHE"
Numéro 4: "MON"
Numéro 3: "JOLI"
Numéro 2: "PETIT"
Et le mot que Bender
dit le plus souvent...
le mot qui peut détruire
cette plančte:
- "CUL".
- On a peu de temps!
Nous exigeons un rebondissement
et un roulement du 3čme type.
Quoi?
Ma chaise est trop dure.
Ca fait mal au...
Comment ēa s'appelle? Bas du dos!
Oui, c'est cette zone-lą.
Je dois casser cette clōture,
tabasser ces gardes...
voler cet hélicoptčre
et sauver Bender.
- J'ai réussi! Mais c'est pas moi.
- Viens! On doit sauver Bender.
- Tu veux le sauver aussi? Pourquoi?
- Fry, tu ne me reconnais pas?
- Hermes?
- Lee, quand te reverrai-je?
Vous źtes bons amis?
Mais je pensais
qu'on serait bons amis.
On va voir si vous vous entendez bien
dans une cellule de prison!
Hé, Zapp!
- Leela!
- C'est donc toi qui m'attirais!
Je n'ai jamais été aussi content
de me faire tabasser par une femme.
On se refera ēa un de ces jours.
Les anciens parlent d'une jeune boule
comme vous.
Il a rebondi ą 3 mčtres du sol.
Puis ą 1,8 mčtres du sol.
Puis il a rebondi ą 4 mčtres du sol.
Vous m'avez bien compris?
M. L'ambassadeur,
notre peuple raconte la mźme histoire.
Ces boules commencent ą m'énerver!
Si elles n'arrźtent pas de rebondir,
je vais leur foutre ce traité au...
- Mais oł vais-je le leur foutre?
- Cette discussion ne mčne nulle part.
On y est.
J'ai suivi les boules.
Je vais rester ą cette altitude
pendant que tu sauteras.
La vie de mon ami est en jeu. Je vais
prouver que je ne suis pas un lāche.
- Tu peux me pousser?
- C'est déją fait!
Merci!
La guerre m'a enfin transformé
en homme.
Messieurs, nous devons mettre fin
ą ce massacre.
Il y a eu trop de victimes,
chez les hommes et les boules.
On ne peut approuver
un rebondissement du 7čme type.
Arrźtez vos conneries!
Je vais me tirer en bagnole.
Mais avant de partir,
j'ai une chose ą dire.
- Léchez mon joli petit...
- Arrźte! Tu ne peux pas continuer!
Ta gueule, crétin! Je l'ai dit
906 fois avant le déjeuner.
Si tu dis le mot en C, la plančte
explosera en mille morceaux.
BOMBE ARMEE
Jeune homme,
vous avez le courage d'un héros.
Et l'haleine aussi fraīche
qu'un jambon au soleil.
- Qu'y a-t-il?
- C'est moi qui ai l'avantage.
Le nom du jeu, c'est: "Rendez Bender
heureux, sinon, il fait tout péter!"
Je préfčre mourir plutōt que
de continuer ą écouter ces imbéciles!
Gardez votre calme.
Inutile de rebondir de colčre.
- Je vais le dire! C comme...
- Attendez.
Arrźtez! Nous cédons: La guerre
est finie. Notre plančte est ą vous.
Super!
- Attendez! C'est votre plančte?
- Exact.
Je pense que vous avez compris.
Faut pas nous chercher des noises!
- Rebondissez en paix.
- Dégagez de ma plančte!
LA GUERRE EST FINIE
Les boules sont vaincues
Et voilą.
Réactivons-le.
Debout!
Salut, bande de crétins!
Vous avez enlevé la bombe?
- Je peux dire mon mot préféré?
- Désolé, on n'a pas pu l'enlever.
On dirait qu'elle a été collée
lą-dedans.
Super! A quoi bon vivre
si je ne peux pas dire "cul"?
Je n'ai pas explosé!
Cul, cul, cul, cul!
Je suis ą nouveau moi-mźme!
On n'a pas pu la désarmer,
donc on a changé le mot.
C'est un mot que tu ne dis jamais.
- C'est pas con! C'est quoi?
- Mieux vaut que tu ne le saches pas.
Allons! Je ne vais pas le dire.
S'il vous plaīt!
- C'est "s'il vous plaīt"?
- Non.
- Voyons... Je sais: "merci"!
- Arrźte de vouloir détruire le monde.
Attendez. C'est "désolé"?
Non. "Génialifique"?
- "Non alcoolisé"?
- Arrźte!
Ca suffit.
"Compassion", "toast ą la
crevette", "estamper"?
Tout va bien.

Robot spatial géant, ici le capitaine
Fry du vaisseau Planet Express.
Nous venons en amis.
Tant pis pour vous!
Maintenant qu'on l'a cassé,
qu'est-ce qu'on fait?
- Les clés du vrai vaisseau!
- Tu crois qu'on peut?
Absolument.
Sais-tu où sont les clés
du vaisseau spatial?
Elles sont à bord.
Quoi?
Le vaisseau ne bougera pas.
Je l'ai attaché avec une amarre
en diamant incassable.
- Je pilote avec mon cul!
- J'ai jamais rien vu d'aussi génial!
- C'était super!
- Et personne ne se doute de rien!
Et voilà pourquoi on le refera plus!
Cette fois, vous avez dépassé
les bornes. Tous les trois!
- Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait?
- Tu as laissé les clés!
Regarde-les.
Tout cela n'était-il pas prévisible?
- Oui, Leela.
- Tu nous déçois beaucoup.
Je vous renverrais sur-le-champ...
si j'étais impitoyable.
Vous êtes tous virés!
Au revoir, les amis.
Vous me manquerez.
Bon débarras! Maintenant,
c'est Zoidberg qui a la cote!
Oui! Parlons tous à Zoidberg.
Alors, Zoidberg, quoi de neuf?
Vous savez...
Comment gagner de l'argent? Tout ce
que j'ai, c'est ma 1ère moustache...
et une photo de mon ex,
Michelle...
avec ce moniteur de ski,
qui est juste un ami.
Pardonnez-moi.
Vous voulez faire un don
au fonds anti-agression?
Pas besoin de mendier.
On n'est pas des anciens combattants.
Que proposes-tu?
Cambrioler Fort Knox à dos d'éléphant?
C'est stupide.
- On peut trouver un travail.
- On en avait un!
J'ai gardé
nos vieilles puces de métier.
- Nos quoi?
- Puces de métier.
Elles t'attribuent le métier
que tu sais faire le mieux.
Quand j'ai voulu t'en donner une,
tu t'es enfui.
- Le jour de notre rencontre.
- Qu'est-il arrivé ensuite?
Donne-moi ta main.

Il n'aime que le week-end.
Mettez la main sous le scanner,

J'ai dû mélanger les puces!
Voici notre conseiller en cryogénie!

Voyons ce que ça dit sur moi!
PREMIER MINISTRE
NORVEGIEN
Bienvenue à bord, monsieur!
Quand le caisson s'ouvre, dites:
"Bienvenue dans le monde de demain!"
Je sais ce que ces personnes
veulent entendre à leur réveil.
Les toilettes, c'est par là.
Qu'est-ce qui vous amène
dans le futur?
Je voulais rencontrer Shakespeare,
pensant que le temps était cyclique.
Non. Il est linéaire.
- Le sondeur a terminé.
- C'était pas bien méchant.
Attendez, il n'a pas encore commencé.
Il va bientôt démarrer.
Bienvenue dans le futur,
esclave humain!
Relax, mon pote. Je ne suis pas
une vraie mouche géante.
Je suis un horrible robot!
Tuez tous les humains!
Il fait une crise cardiaque!
- Ca se soignera dans le futur.
- Ca se soigne déjà!
Bon. Alors, je peux me servir de ça?

Ce sondeur sait ce qui plaît

J'ai commandé une pizza.
J'ai une pizza pour...
Jean Jettunmax.
Très drôle.
Maintenant, crachez les 12,95 $.
- Après une demi-heure, c'est gratuit.
- Ca fait que 23 minutes.
Moi, j'ai 33 minutes.
Ça fait que 23 minutes,
stupide cannoli!
Si t'as un problème,
on règle ça dehors!
Je me battrai avec cette boîte.
C'est à ma portée.
Paie-moi. Je dois 30 dollars
pour cet uniforme.
35, stupide boulette de viande!
Qui est le suivant?
Non. Non!
Mon Dieu, c'est Pauly Shore!
Génial!
Je vous ai adoré dans Bio-Dome. Vous
avez fait du grabuge dans ce refuge.
Si ça rime, c'est possible.
Dans le futur, vous pouvez vivre
dans un vrai bio-dôme.
Une perspective peu séduisante.
J'ai fait des simulations
par ordinateur qui ont montré...
que ce concept
présentait des imperfections.
Qu'il s'agisse d'un dôme,
d'une sphère, d'un cube...
ou même de l'imposant tétraèdre,
mon vieux.
Comment vous êtes-vous
retrouvé congelé?
Pendant Encino Man, ma curiosité
intellectuelle était à son maximum.
J'ai décidé de congeler le blaireau.
Le blaireau!
J'étais censé être dégelé...
pour la 1000ème projection
de Jury Duty Il.
Pourquoi je n'y suis pas?
Je vous ai réveillé plus tôt
pour faire des trucs.
Comme quoi?
- J'adore ce boulot.
- Moi aussi!
Que la fête commence.
Je dirai que j'ai la peste spatiale.
Michelle?
Mon Dieu!
Fry? C'est bien toi?
Je ne sais pas. C'est bien toi?
Comment ca?
Tu es toi ou pas?
- Qu'est-ce que ça peut faire?
- Oui, Fry, c'est bien toi!
La dernière fois que je t'ai vue,
tu allais bien.
T'as m'avais plaqué et tu allais
prendre un nouveau départ.
- Pourquoi tu t'es congelée?
- Fry.
Après ton départ, les choses
ont mal tourné. Je me suis mariée.
Je suis désolé.
Il s 'appelait Charles.
Il était dans une fac prestigieuse
dont l'entraîneur de basket...
n 'était autre que Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Je lui ai payé ses cours de droit
en promenant des chiens enragés.
Mais une fois Charles diplômé, notre
mariage a commencé à battre de l'aile.
Je suis désolé.
Je me suis tournée vers la seule chose
pouvant me consoler:
Une fête foraine.
Mais un cure-dent s 'est logé dans
le tableau de commande du Spizzler...
et j'ai dû y rester pendant 8 heures.
Mais ça m'a donné
l'occasion de réfléchir.
Je me suis souvenu que j'avais
vraiment été heureuse avec toi.
Tu t'es donc congelée
pour venir me chercher?
Non. Je voulais prendre
un nouveau départ. Tu avais disparu.
La police t'aurait cherché, mais
tes parents jugeaient ça trop cher.
Ils m'ont aussi retiré de l'école pour
ca. Personne ne se souciait de moi?
Pas vraiment.
A l'exception d'une personne.
Qui ca?
Tout est si différent!
Pas tout.
Il y a toujours des cafards.
MUSEE D'ART VRAIMENT MODERNE
Les gens s'intéressent
à l'art tatoué sur des obèses.
J'ai été prêté par le Louvre.
S'il vous plaît, professeur.
On mérite une seconde chance.
Si vous ne le faites pas pour moi,
vous le ferez peut-être...
pour Og,
gorille empereur de la Terre!
Désolé, Og, j'ai un nouvel équipage.
Comment c'était, votre livraison
sur la planète des rêves...
où les rêves deviennent réalité?
- Génial!
- Impeccable!
Le temps d'une nuit, j'ai su
ce que c'était que d'être grand-mère.
J'étais subjugué et honoré.
Tu vois, Og?
Tout marche comme sur des roulettes.
Je peux laisser mon puzzle sans
craindre que Fry en mange les pièces.
Oubliez Fry. Reprenez-nous.
Il ne le saura jamais.
Salut, les gars!
Salut, Fry!
Comme le disait Leela,
Fry peux aller se faire...
Content de vous voir.
Voici mon ex-petite amie
du dernier millénaire, Michelle.
Michelle, voici Leela.
Voici Bender.
Le professeur.
- Hermes et Amy.
- Enchantée.
Et voici Dr Zoidberg.
Tu sors avec ton ex?
- Tu n'as donc aucune fierté?
- Aucune quoi?
- Ca finira mal: Enfants, maison...
- Un ancien colocataire envahissant.
C'est différent. Avant,
elle était exigeante et possessive.
Maintenant, elle me veut
toujours à ses côtés.
Et voilà, mes petites chéries.
Ca me rassure de te connaître.
J'ai du mal à me faire
aux curiosités du futur.
Je viens de Mars.
Je ne comprends pas pourquoi
Fry est si bien adapté, ici.
Parce qu'il ne l'était pas
à ton époque.
C'est vrai. Je l'étais très bien, moi.
Bonne chance, ma vieille!
Ne le prends pas mal.
- Tes amis sont bizarres.
- Super, hein?
Je suis une étrangère, ici!
Impossible de trouver une crème
de nuit qui ne m'endorme pas.
- Je n'ai pas de travail!
- Je devais t'en donner un.
Je vais t'implanter ta puce de métier.
Donne ta paume.
C'est comme se faire percer la main.
Ce monde est horrible.
Allons dans un endroit
où on sera rien que toi et moi.
Romantique...
Je vais dire à Bender de venir.
Je ne parlais pas d'un lieu,
mais d'un temps: Le futur.
Je pensais plutôt à une chambre
d'hôtel avec un matelas vibrant.
Je t'aime. Tu ne m'aimes pas, toi?
Si, autant qu'un homme peut aimer
une femme. Là, c'est le grand saut.
Pourquoi tu analyses tout
avec ta logique implacable?
Seul notre amour compte.
C'est vrai. Faisons-le maintenant
sans jamais le regretter.
Je ne regrette pas.
Mais je m'en repens et je le déplore.
L'an 4000 est très décevant.
Je regrette l'an 3000 où la vie était
simple, quand on mangeait des lasers.
C'est pas si mal. Le destin
nous a réunis et nous a amenés ici.
Tu nous a amenés ici.
Continue de geindre.
C'est très séduisant.
Construis-nous un refuge.
Tout est naze, ici. On peut au moins
vivre dans un endroit sympa.
- Et voilà!
- Moi, vivre dans un trou?
Ce serait plus profond
si je n'étais pas sur une taupe.
- Regarde! Des enfants!
- Ils vont nous sauver!
On est sauvés!
Je suis Butch. C'est moi le chef!
J'ai confisqué votre trou.
Un point, c'est tout!
Monsieur, on a nulle part où aller.
On peut rester avec vous?
D'accord, mais ne gênez pas
nos grands travaux.
Ca va vraiment me plaire
d'être sous les ordres de Butch.
Ton problème,
c'est que tu n'as aucune ambition.
Tu devrais être le chef.
Pour avoir un ulcère?
Je veux du pouvoir! J'en ai assez...
que la copine du chef me nargue
avec sa peau de coyote.
D'accord. Si ça peut te faire plaisir,
je vais renverser le gouvernement.
A quel titre
contestez-vous mon autorité?
Je suis plus âgé
et plus fort que vous.
- C'est sûr.
- Il a des poils sur les bras.
D'accord, papi.
Il n'y a qu'un moyen de trancher:
La course de la mort.
- C'est quoi?
- Ca ressemble au skate.
- La moitié du temps, il y a un mort.
- C'est moins risqué que le skate.
Celui qui garde le bandana
sera le nouveau chef.
Ma mère a toujours
dit que tu étais un loser.
- Prouve qu'elle a tort!
- Beth a dit ca?
DENIVELLATION
Ca va. Reculez!
Je me suis égratigné le genou!
Pauvre petit père.
Laisse-moi jeter un œil...
J'ai gagné! Je suis le nouveau chef!
Je suis plus grand et plus lourd!
Rends-le-moi, grand dadais!
- Butch, ta maman est là!
- Oh, non!
Vous êtes en retard
pour le cours d'hébreux!
Je veux pas y aller.
Tous les lundis et mercredis,
c'est pareil.
Ce désert post-apocalyptique
est très déroutant.
- Je suis complètement perdu.
- Parce que tu es un loser.
Tu étais un loser en l'an 2000
et t'en es un en l'an 4000.
Mais en l'an 3000, j'avais tout:
Des amis, un boulot mal payé,
un lit dans un placard de robot!
Je n'enviais personne!
Mais tu as tout gâché!
Arrête de te défendre, Fry!
On va avoir une longue discussion
rasoir sur notre relation!
Ecoute bien ce que je vais te dire!
Je te quitte.
Il doit y avoir des gens quelque part.
Des empreintes de pied!
Et des empreintes de main?
Que se passe-t-il?
CINEMA LOEW QADDAFI
MANN GRAUMAN
Dieu merci, on t'a retrouvé!
Qu'est-ce que vous faites
en l'an 4000?
On n'est pas en l'an 4000.
Tu n'as été congelé que 2 jours.
Au fait, j'ai cassé ton lit.
Tu étais dans le caisson de Shore.
Ils l'ont livré à la projection du film.
Constatant qu'il y avait erreur,
ils se sont débarrassés de toi.
Alors ce ne sont pas
les ruines de New York en l'an 4000?
- Tu es à Los Angeles!
- Mais il y avait des gamins armés.
Tout à fait. Tu es à L.A.
- Tout le monde se tire dessus!
- C'est ça, L.A.!
- Aucun signe de civilisation.
- Arrête ton discours sociologique.
Les gens sont bidons. Personne ne lit.
Il y a de la coriandre partout...
- Michelle, chérie!
- Ca ne marchera jamais.
Mieux vaut avoir des remords
que des regrets, n 'est-ce pas?
J'en ai assez des femmes.
Je vais me concentrer sur ma carrière.
Vous me reprenez?
J'ai oublié pourquoi je t'avais viré.
Il a détruit votre entreprise
et tous vos biens.
Ah, oui.
Va voir ailleurs si j'y suis!

Dr ZOIDBERG
SARL médicale
Revoilà notre hypocondriaque.
C'est quoi, cette fois?
- Mon tuyau me fait mal.
- C'est normal. Au suivant!
C'est un sorcier!
- Tu as mangé un truc inhabituel?
- Non.
- Et le sandwich œufs-salade?
- J'ai déjà eu mieux.
Œufs-salade? Zoidberg devra te faire
des examens gastro-intestinaux.
Venez, laissons un peu
d'intimité à Fry.
Si vous voyez mal à travers ce miroir,
ce sera en gros plan sur cet écran.
Il va falloir que je regarde
à l'intérieur avec cette caméra.
Non, pas par là.
- C'est dégoûtant!
- Vas-y!
Cherchez la moindre irrégularité
dans les intestins de Fry.
C'est génial.
Avant, c'était une vraie décharge.
- Des vers? Ca donne la gerbe!
- Les œufs du sandwich étaient...
Oui, des œufs de vers. La mayonnaise
n'était plus trop fraîche non plus.
Ca me donne la nausée. On peut pas
lui enlever ces affreux asticots?
Le seul moyen est de voyager
à l'intérieur de Fry...
dans ceci!
- Preum's!
- Preum's!
Votre kit de gastro-survie contient:
Un imperméable, un jetable...
et quelque chose pour vous protéger
des bactéries: Un harpon.
Pourquoi on utilise ces microdroïdes?
Vous ne pouvez pas nous réduire?
Il faudrait de minuscules atomes.
Vous savez combien ils coûtent?
- Je ne roule pas sur l'or. Arrêtez!
- A mon tour!
Grâce à vos combinaisons, vous irez
dans les intestins parasités de Fry...
comme si vous étiez un vers.
C'est un programme qui me plaît.
- Tout le monde est là?
- Plus que jamais.
On va rentrer par son oreille,
descendre par la gorge...
et atteindre les intestins. Là, nous
irriterons le ganglion de la rate...
ce qui causera un spasme qui
expulsera les parasites, entre autres.
- Il faut qu'il se nettoie l'oreille.
- Non, Fry ne doit rien savoir!
S'il est au courant,
les vers se défendront.
- Ils savent tout ce qu'il sait.
- Comme faire de la soupe à la glace?
- Leela! Tu dois distraire Fry.
- A vos ordres!
Leela, tu devrais essayer
un soin gommant pour tes pores.
- Regarde, un étourneau!
- Ah oui?
Pas un bruit.
Nous sommes dans son oreille.
- D'accord, Professeur.
- Quoi?
Qu'est-ce que tu as dit?
Pourquoi on n'irait pas faire un tour,
c'est une si belle journée?
Avec plaisir.
- Allons à un endroit inaccessible.
- On n'y arrivera pas!
Il nous suffit d'atteindre le tympan.
- Que font-ils au cerveau de Fry?
- Ils le remettent en état.
Je dirais qu'ils ont doublé
son intelligence.
Il sera bientôt
plus intelligent que Cher!
Ah, ce parfum. C'est curieux comme
des hydrocarbones aromatiques...
peuvent réveiller des émotions.
C'est pour toi.
Quelle délicate pensée!
Et tu me l'as dit sans me cracher
de miettes à la figure.
Accrochez-vous.
Nous entrons dans le nez de Fry.
Alerte au doigt de niveau cinq!
Espérons que rien ne stimule
ses récepteurs olfactifs.
Ne dégagez aucune odeur.
Vite! Utilisons ce capillaire
pour aller dans les sinus.
D'habitude, tu ne connais rien
à l'anatomie humaine.
J'ai appris ça dans une pub pour
un décongestif: "Action apaisante..."
- On est où, le cul?
- Le cœur...
- ou muscle de l'amour.
- Qui digère la nourriture.
On est en sûreté tant que rien
ne le fait battre plus vite.
- Abandonnez le vaisseau!
- Non!
Dirigeons-nous vers cette valve
incrustée de cholestérol.
C'est du bon cholestérol,
mais il s'étale comme du mauvais.
Ils exercent les muscles de Fry.
Il sera aussi fort et souple
qu'Elastoman et Hercule combinés.
Elasto-Hercule? J'adore ce type.
C'est le crétin du relais routier.
Allons dans la rue des maquereaux.
Ca m'étonnerait. Je crois que vous
devez des excuses à cette dame.
Fry, non! Toutes ces formes
pourraient être des muscles.
Tu veux des excuses, en voilà!
Désolé, madame. Je retiendrai
cette leçon: Je ne materai plus.
Ah, l'estomac. Une porte pittoresque
qui mène aux intestins.
Abandonnez le vaisseau!
N'abandonnons pas maintenant.
On est tout près du sphincter pylorique.
On a réussi!
Nous y sommes. Voici l'imposant
centre des intestins de Fry.
Une forteresse extrêmement protégée
qui entoure le ganglion de la rate.
Oui, je sais ce que c'est.
Si on arrive à le stimuler,
la contraction expulsera les vers.
Et les vers qui sont ailleurs
dans son corps?
Ses intestins auront
une sacrée convulsion.
- Il risque même d'y laisser ses os!
- On va réduire ses vers en bouillie!
Tous les vers aux postes de défense!
C'était génial. Les fleurs, la flaque,
la raclée que tu as mise à ce type.
Mais je peux te demander une chose?
Pourquoi fais-tu tout ça?
Je veux te dire quelque chose
depuis longtemps.
Quand j'essaie, ma bouche se remplit
de beurre de cacahouètes.
- C'est au sujet de Bender?
- Non, de toi et moi.
- Et Bender?
- Ca ne le concerne pas. Leela...
- Je t'aime.
- Vraiment?
Mais ce n'est que récemment
que j'ai réussi à articuler mes pensées.
Je t'aime, Leela.
Et je t'ai toujours aimée.
Fry, c'est la chose
la plus gentille... Attends!
Récemment?
Depuis que tu as mangé ce sandwich?
Oui, j'ignore pourquoi, mais
ma vie a complètement changé depuis.
Ne bouge pas.
Un autre nougathé?
Oui. Je dois boire un truc:
J'ai l'estomac qui gargouille.
Le nerf est de l'autre côté.
Où est Zoidberg?
Vous ne devinerez jamais où j'étais.
Un, deux, trois!
Le voilà.
Le ganglion pelvien de la rate.
Chatouillons-le et en avant
pour la chevauchée fantastique.
- Je vous déconseille de le faire.
- Leela! Tu arrives à temps.
Expulsons-les maintenant
ou ils iront si profondément...
que même les célèbres pruneaux
d'Hermès ne pourront les déloger.
- C'est mon déboucheur antillais.
- Fry aura des vers pour l'éternité.
Parfait.
- Je n'ai rien.
- Leela, pauvre ignorante!
- Il aura toujours ces vers en lui.
- Et alors?
- Il préfère peut-être les avoir.
- C'est ridicule.
Si quelqu'un veut bien me dire
ce qui se passe, je serai dans le salon.
De tous les parasites que j'ai eus,
ces vers comptent parmi...
Ce sont les meilleurs! Comment
te remercier de les avoir sauvés?
Je vais y réfléchir.
Vous nous faites quoi, là?
Appartement 2-Q.
Avant, je me serais moqué.
Ca manque un peu de meubles.
Je songe à faire mettre une fenêtre.
La vue est déjà magnifique.
Ce compliment est d'un banal.
Je vais te montrer la chambre.
Tout à l'heure.
Un holophonore?
Peu de gens savent en jouer
et ils ne sont pas très bons.
Tu n'es pas là pour les inspirer.
Les mots me manquent pour dire
à quel point tu es génial.
Seule la soupe de l'orphelinarium
me rendait aussi heureuse.
Avec toi, c'est la soupe
de l'orphelinarium tous les jours.
Fry, j'aime ce que tu es devenu.
Ce que je suis devenu...
- Qu'y a-t-il?
- Je dois vérifier quelque chose.
- Qui contrôle ces intestins?
- Qui veut savoir ca?
L'UNIVERS CONNU
- Je suis le maire de la colonne.
- Vous voulez dire du côlon?
- Quelle raison vous amène?
- Avez-vous déjà été amoureux?
Une fois, je crois.
Puis je me suis souvenu
qu'on se reproduit par nuages de spores.
Une fille merveilleuse m'aime,
mais je dois savoir si c'est moi...
ou ce que vous avez fait de moi
qu'elle aime. Donc...
- Je vous demande de partir.
- Attends un peu! Je suis né ici...
et mes enfants aussi. Mes ancêtres
sont arrivés grâce au sandwich.
Personne ne me fera partir d'ici!
FERMETURE DE LA PORTE
CERVEAU - POUMONS
FOIE - SALLE DE BAL
- Partez ou je touche le cerveau!
- C'est du pipeau!
Personne ne se rendrait
délibérément idiot.
Vous n'avez jamais été amoureux.
Au tour du lobe
de coordination mains-yeux.
Tu as endommagé ton cerveau...
mais pas plus que si tu avais bu
ou passé 5 minutes avec ton portable.
J'essayais de me rapprocher du centre
de contrôle du cœur et des poumons.
- Si je me tue, vous mourrez avec moi.
- Pas si vite, mec.
J'espère que Satan a un beau côlon
car c'est là que vous vivrez.
Arrête! Nous partons. Mais un jour
tu mangeras un hamburger...
et boum!
Tu ramperas à nouveau parmi nous.
Tu sais ce qui fait que la "sauce
maison" est "maison"? Moi.
HISTOIRES VRAIES
D'ANIMAUX COURAGEUX
Fry? Tu m'as manqué.
Tu as vérifié ce que tu voulais?
- On va voir. Je vais jouer un truc.
- C'est pas nécessaire.
- Je suis toujours sous le charme.
- C'est important pour moi.
- Ca veut dire quoi?
- J'en sais rien.
J'étais anxieux et j'ai pensé
à des boulons cervicaux.
Tu as vu comment ce vase
s'est cassé? Ca a fait...
- Que t'est-il arrivé?
- J'ai éjecté mes vers.
- Pourquoi as-tu fait ça?
- Je devais savoir qui tu aimais...
- moi ou eux.
- Qui m'a écrit ce sonnet?
Moi! Je crois. Enfin, moitié-moitié.
Mais c'est vraiment ce que je ressens.
- J'en sais rien.
- Laisse mon romantisme s'exprimer.
J'ai de l'huile de massage. Je vais te
frotter le dos comme je faisais à Amy.
Elle avait toujours l'air de...
RESIDENCE DES ROBOTS
Désolé que ça ait foiré. Si ça peut
te consoler, ma vie est géniale.
Les gonzes, le flouze, j'ai tout.
Au moins, j'ai compris que Leela
est une cause perdue. J'abandonne.
Tu l'as dit! Bonne nuit.
Demain, je vais faire du parachute
ascensionnel avec des stars.

AMAZONES AMOUREUSES
Il y a un problème.
Nibbler vomit des boules de poils.
Fry aussi. Qu'est-ce qui t'inquiète?
J'en reviens pas.
On aime tous Nibbler, alors on devrait
le laver tous ensemble.
Zoidberg devrait s'en occuper.
Qui est d'accord?
Pas d'accord?
Qui s'abstient?
Dr Zoidberg, ça va?
Il est mort.
Il était toujours plein de vie.
Il riait, chantait, mangeait à tous
les râteliers. Et maintenant!
C'est quoi, tous ces pleurs?
C'est donc là que j'ai laissé
ma carapace.
C'est amovible?
J'étais à l'étroit donc j'ai mué,
pourquoi pas?
- L'air frais me fait du bien.
- Arrête de faire ca!
Au revoir.
Je vais jeter ça aux ordures...
et peut-être finir le reste
de chips d'Amy.
- C'était des rognures d'ongles.
- Un festin reste un festin.
Ca, c'est mon portable!
PORTABLE PARTENAIRE
Allô? Qui c'est?
Tu as encore avalé ton portable?
Il y a un gars qui m'appelle
et raccroche depuis un an.
Ceux qui appellent trop
sont les pires.
Si c'était un mec bien au moins!
Pas comme ce dingue qui me terrifie rien
qu'à l'idée de répondre au téléphone.
Allô? Il y a quelqu'un?
Je t'aime!
LES RESCAPES DU TITANIC
Pourquoi suis-je si poltron?
Je vais aux toilettes.
Il me faut un assistant.
Pardon.
Tu pleures comme une mauviette!
Je me sens une âme de père auprès
de mes hommes les plus pitoyables.
Kif, mon vieux. Causons un peu.
Je suis tombé amoureux d'une fille.
Ca, c'est fort!
Vas-y, continue.
Je l'ai rencontrée
l'an dernier...
quand on a évacué le croiseur que
vous aviez dirigé dans un trou noir.
Oui, c'était dans toute la presse.
Appelle-moi.
- Je disais plus rien.
- Retire ca!
Ton Amy connaît ma Leela?
J'ai une idée.
Que dites-vous d'un double
rendez-vous avec Kif et moi?
Jamais!
On peut négocier.
Je propose 10 rendez-vous.
- Si on disait zéro?
- Neuf.
- Zéro.
- Sept? Huit?
Allez! Kif est le mec le plus adorable
qui ne m'ait jamais aimée.
Cinq. A prendre ou à laisser.
Quatre!
- Un.
- Deux.
- Un demi.
- D'accord.
On se verra pour une partie
du dîner et la moitié d'un film.
Le Palmier en Orbite

Je n'ai presque jamais de rendez-vous.
Et si je ne sais pas quoi dire?
J'ai le manuel de la drague.
Faut en dire un max le plus vite
possible sans s'arrêter.
- Je vais juste lui donner ces fleurs.
- Tu as tout faux.
Et ça, c'est des bonbons?
C'est pour les beaufs. Donne-moi ça!
- Bonsoir, beauté. Voici pour toi.
- Merci.
Plutôt troublant! Ca ressemble
à un rendez-vous érotique.
Un demi rendez-vous.
- Une bouteille!
- Une demi.
- Des demi-coques d'huîtres.
- Quarts de coque.
- Je voudrais...
- Il n'a pas faim. C'est cher, ici.
Deux steaks pour moi et une salade
sensuelle pour les dames...
avec vinaigrette sensuelle allégée.
SOIREE KARAOKE.
Merci.
Kif, tu n'as rien dit de la soirée.
Eh bien...
Bonsoir.
J'espérais vraiment bavarder avec toi.
"Ton corps est superbe...
tu peux te déshabiller et danser?"
- Quoi?
- Lieutenant Kroker!
"Les nichons sont ce qu'il y a
de plus érotique."
Ce demi rendez-vous est fini.
Amy? Allons discuter.
On ne peut pas rattraper ça?
Il y a seulement un moyen de regagner
le cœur d'une femme et bien plus.
Bien sûr, je parle du karaoké.
Mes années de chorale
n'auront pas été vaines.
Ca suffit, le rouge à lèvres.
Partons!
Quelle émotion!
A plus, les amateurs.
Laissez-moi vous montrer pourquoi
on m'appelle "Brume de velours".
Musique!
- Arrête ton cirque.
- Quel dégoûtant!
NACELLE D'EVASION
EN CAS D'URGENCE,
CASSER LA VITRE
On rentre.
Appelez-nous un taxi spatial.
Pas besoin.
Je sais piloter tous les restaurants.
Où allez-vous?
Capitaine, partageons l'addition et...
Voyons ce que peut faire ce resto.
C'est un resto mais ça se pilote
comme un bistro.
Il ne répond plus!
Tu as encore gagné, gravité!
J'ai le nouveau catalogue
de carapaces! Je vais en essayer.
Muy macho!
Gringos, El Zoido est venu contaminer

Je suis mexicain et c'est insultant!

- On doit les sauver!
- Peut-être pas.
Bender, pense aux señoritas!
Vámonos!
Alors, Amy...
- Toi et tes phrases!
- C'est quelle planète?
- Ce secteur est inconnu.
- Non. Vous avez perdu la carte.
Il ne nous reste plus qu'à repeupler
la région, toi et moi.
Et peut-être toi.
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
- Moi entends gens mais les vois pas.
- Tout le monde il fait des erreurs.
Bonjour.
Je ne dis jamais ça mais...
je n'ai jamais vu plus beau trio
de femmes géantes.
Les nichons sont ce qu'il y a
de plus éro...
Aucune trace de Leela ou d'Amy?
Non, mais à ton avis, c'est quoi ça?
Aucune idée.
Ca a peut-être un rapport avec ça.
Oh, votre Dieu!
Bouge. Marche.
Voilà ce qu'on va faire.
C'est quoi ce plan débile?
Libérez les femmes.
On garde les hommes.
"On les emmène à notre chef.
Elle sait quoi qu'en faire."
Une chef?
- Ferme-la, Fry!
- Oui, Capitaine.
Ici capitale de planète Amazonia.
- Où sont les hommes?
- Les hommes, tous morts.
Ils ont dû être harcelés à mort.
Vous me suivez, les gars?
Ici stade où femmes
jouent basket-ball.
- Pas smash mais bonne technique.
- Plus drôle à voir.
Vous me tuez, là!
Vous me tuez!

DES COMIQUES
C'est notre club comédie.
Humour différent ici.
Pas sur stéréotypes.
Comédie vient du caractère, des

Traduction: C'est rasant.
Elle est bonne.
- Ca me plaît de plus en plus, ici.
- Je cherche un appartement.
Cavernes à louer
Ici vit sage dirigeante vindicative.
Décide sort des hommes.
- Est-elle sexy?
- Pas important. Elle sait tout.
Ca veut dire "non".
- Salut, Femme-machine!
- Salut à toi!
- Vous vénérez une machine?
- Apparue quand hommes sont morts.
- Pourquoi en avoir fait votre chef?
- Politicienne différente.
Hors cercle politique.
Pour toi, perles de bain

Ton présent plaît à Femme-machine.
Pourquoi ces hommes sur notre planète?
- C'est un accident.
- Ça n 'explique rien.
Femme-machine reviendra après
avoir réfléchi à votre châtiment!
Je ne rirai plus des femmes.
Faut qu'elles m'aident.
On fait quelque chose?
Y a pas le feu.
Oui. Serrez encore un peu plus.
Une fessée s'impose peut-être?
Trop fort!
- Hommes bizarres. Sont avec vous?
- Hélas, oui.
Servent à quoi?
Vous voulez dire tac-tac!
Hommes utilisés pour tac-tac.
On a seulement ancienne légende
et abonnement à Cosmo.
Moi, je peux servir pour tac-tac.
Silence! Vouloir mourir comme
derniers hommes sur Amazonia?
- Comment sont-ils morts?
- Bassins écrasés.
- Oui!
- Merci, Dieu éternel!
Après une longue femme-machination,
j'ai décidé du sort de ces hommes.
Femme-machine
les condamne à mourir...
- en faisant tac-tac!
- Oui!
Tu es homo, ou quoi?
Mort aux hommes!
Mort par tac-tac!
- Le tac-tac, ça sera bien.
- Ca te décoiffera, mec.
Soyez raisonnable.
Les hommes sont agaçants
et ils abîment nos planètes.
Mais certains d'entre eux sont
mes amis. Ils ne méritent pas la mort.
Ils ne sont peut-être pas si mauvais.
Ils rient de notre basket-ball.
Vous leur avez dit
que votre technique compensait...
- votre incapacité à smasher?
- Oui. Rient encore.
- Ils doivent mourir!
- Vous êtes sage, Femme-machine.
Tuez-les tous. Bon débarras.
Moi, je ne suis qu'un homme-robot!
Erreur compréhensible.
Détachez-moi.
- Lui, enfoiré comme un homme.
- J'ai rien entre les jambes!
Très bien. Libérez-le.
Quant aux autres, emmenez-les
dans les chambres à tac-tac.
- Tu me manqueras, chair fraîche.
- A moi aussi.
Je ne pensais pas finir comme ça,
mais je l'avais espéré.
Les Amazones seront divisées
en trois groupes.
Zapp fera tac-tac
avec les grandes femmes.
Celui au nom de Fry le fera
avec les femmes de petite taille.
Kif, le plus bel homme...
fera tac-tac avec les plus belles
femmes d'Amazonia...
puis, les grandes femmes,
et celles de petite taille...
et encore les grandes femmes.
Que tac-tac commence!
Je ne voulais pas dire ces terribles
choses lors de notre rendez-vous.
- C'était l'idée de Zapp.
- C'est vrai de vrai?
Oui. Et c'est moi qui n'arrête pas
d'appeler et de raccrocher.
J'avais peur de dire bonjour
car je t'aime!
Première fois pour Og.
Me fais pas mal!
Il faut intervenir.
Communique avec la Femme-machine
et reprogramme-la.
Communique avec mon cul.
En le mordant!
C'est bon, j'y vais.
- Comment est Tonk?
- Tonk jolie. Moi grosse.
Non, toi jolie. Tonk grosse.
Intrus! Eloignez-vous de la puissante
Femme-machine! Gardes!
Il est temps de reprogrammer
l'unité centrale.
Arrêtez!
Allez, basta!
Arrêtez de cogner Femme-machine!
Vous êtes une femme-robot!
C'est vrai. Je me suis déguisée pour
régner sur les Amazones.
- Pourquoi?
- Pourquoi?
Je viens d'une planète lointaine
dominée par...
un homme-machine machiste
qui n'est en fait qu'un homme-robot.
Vous savez ce que c'est
que d'être une femme-robot...
- dans un univers d'hommes?
- Quoi?
Que vais-je faire de vous maintenant,
homme-robot qui se mêle de tout?
Une pause. Le cœur y est
mais on a la chair molle et meurtrie.
- C'est l'heure tac-tac!
- Seulement un câlin?
Non!
N'attendons pas Bender.
Aux femmes de jouer!
Moi prochain tac-tac! Du vent!
Où parti bel homme?
Moi veux tac-tac!
- Kif, saute!
- Mon héroïne.
Moi pas avoir eu tac-tac.
Attrapez-le!
Puissante Femme-machine!
Petite fille vole homme guimauve.
- Je la tue maintenant?
- Plus tard. Laisse-moi tranquille.
Ouais, va-t-en!
Je suis une terrible femme-machine.
Relâchez les prisonniers.
- Et apportez plein d'or.
- Pourquoi vouloir or?
Vous avez entendu l'homme.
Fais-moi goûter ça.
C'est ainsi que j'ai eu ma nouvelle
carapace. Elle est comme la dernière.
Je l'ai trouvée dans les ordures,
mais elle dissimulait un raton laveur.
Pas mal mon histoire, hein?
Lâche-moi, crampon, et ferme-la.
La bataille des sexes
a été résolue...
quand un homme-robot et une femme-robot
ont réalisé qu'ils s'aimaient.
Si elle appelle, je ne suis pas là.
Regardez-moi cet or.
C'était la plus géniale des missions.
- Ca, c'est vrai.
- Oh, oui.
J'ai fait tac-tac.
Alors, Amy?
Que veux-tu faire maintenant?

EN AVANCE SUR
LES GROS TITRES DE DEMAIN
BENDER EST AMOUREUX
- SystŤme de guidage?
- Connectť.
- Auto-pilote?
- Prťsent.
- Jauge de matiŤre noire?
- Fait du bruit.
Parťs au dťcollage.
On s'arrache.
Messieurs, j'ai fini mon rapport
sur l'accident.
Je ne vais pas lire tout Áa!
Rťsume-le en un mot.
Sabotage.
Voici un ťlťment L normal. Sans lui,
voyager dans l'espace est un rÍve.
- Ouais.
- C'est un ťlťment important.
Et ceci, mes amis, est l'ťlťment L
que je viens d'enlever du vaisseau.
Ce n'est pas un L!
Sauf si les minuscules comptent.
Tu sais qu'elles ne comptent pas!
Le responsable est fort. Il s'agit de
170 kilos d'acier certifiť Tonka.
Ca devrait ressembler ŗ ca.
Mais ca ressemble ŗ ca.
- Qui a fait ca?
- Qui a pu faire Áa?
Et par "Áa", j'entends ceci.
On dirait que nous avons
un nouveau mystŤre ŗ rťsoudre.
Je vais faire un tableau des suspects.
Je commence par un trait avec ma rŤgle.
Par la lamproie de Santa Fe!
Ma rŤgle a ťtť tordue!
Mon javelot aussi! Il est fichu!
On ne battra jamais l'Etat de Jupiter.
Mon ami Ressort!
Mon adorable petit compagnon!
Pourquoi tant d'agitation?
MÍme le professeur a ťtť tordu.
Merci de compatir,
carrť de linolťum parlant.
Je vais vous aider.
- Et voilŗ.
- Qu'as-tu fait au professeur?
Je l'ai tordu.
- C'est Bender!
- J'accuse!
On retrouve des trucs tordus,
alors on accuse le robot tordeur.
On va vťrifier sur les vidťos
de surveillance de cette nuit.
- Des vidťos?
- Tu m'as vu nu?
La vidťo de cette nuit.
Juste ŗ cŰtť de Bathroom Bloopers 4.
Vous voyez? Rien!
Je vous l'avais dit, bande de nazes.
Attends! Lŗ, sur l'ťcran!
C'est ce type que tu es!
- Je suis somnambule!
- Nous avons des robots au plafond.
Tu n'es pas somnambule,
tu es tord-nambule.
Quel choc.
En mÍme temps,
Áa n'a rien de surprenant.
AprŤs tout, je tords les choses
depuis le jour oý on m'a construit.
Je suis nť sur une chaÓne
de montage prŤs de Tijuana.
Maman.
ECOLE DE TORDAGE
ProgrŤs en cours
Hourra! J'ai mon diplŰme!
Je pars en Europe quelques mois,
et je trouve un poste de tordeur.
- Tu te souviens de ta naissance?
- C'ťtait il y a quatre ans.
- Tu n'as que quatre ans?
- Je suis plutŰt prťcoce, hein?
Bender a un besoin de tordre que
ne peut satisfaire son mode de vie.
Alors il reprťsente un danger pour
les membres droits de cette sociťtť.
Va satisfaire ta soif de tordre.
Et ne reviens pas ici
avant que ce ne soit fait!
USINE DE TORDAGE
Plus de tordage, c'est trop dur
Augmente-nous, espŤce d'ordure
Jamais!
La mafia vous soutient!
Mais silence! Faites passer le mot!
En tant que truands dŻment ťlus
par ce syndicat...
nous nous devons de soutenir
ces ploucs dans leur combat.
- Et si leur patron est "imprÍtable"?
- Vu le contexte, je te comprends.
Dans ce cas, La Pince
aura une surprise pour eux.
Les pinces!
C'est ca?
Oh, non! Une grŤve?
Je ne tordrai jamais rien!
Oh, pauvre Bender!
La direction refuse qu'on finisse tŰt
le lundi au lieu du vendredi.
- Quoi?
- Ils payent les jaunes dix fois plus.
Dix fois plus!
Je vais leur montrer ŗ ces salauds!
- Bienvenue ŗ bord, le jaune.
- Content d'Ítre lŗ.
Je vais te prťsenter les autres jaunes
avec qui tu vas travailler.
Voici le jaune qui est contremaÓtre.
- Flexo?
- Bender?
Dťsolť qu'on t'ait envoyť dans ce
bagne turc sud-amťricain ŗ ma place.
Enfoirť! Ils m'ont traitť comme
un animal! Et j'en suis devenu un!
Non, je ne t'en veux pas.
Ravi de te revoir!
Et voici une autre jaune
qui travaille ici, Angleene.
Salut.
Les gars, vous me bougez ce truc?
Salut!
- Augmente-nous, espŤce d'ordure
- Jamais!
- Salut, Angleene. Tu fais quoi?
- Des cintres.
- Il paraÓt que j'ai le coup de main.
- C'est super.
Je me demandais si...
Tu sais, sinon Áa ne fait rien,
mais...
- Tu fais quoi aprŤs le boulot?
- Comme d'habitude: Que dalle.
Moi aussi. On a des tas de
choses en commun, hein?
Nous sommes faits des mÍmes
composants.
Tu es sŻre? Je devrais vťrifier
ton panneau de configuration.
Selon le manuel du jaune, ce serait
du badinage inopportun.
Exactement comme j'aime.
Par Hailť Sťlassiť!
Lŗ, mon ami. Te voilŗ comme neuf.
Quelle belle journťe!
Ce bleu du ciel. Ce vert des arbres.
Ces adorables petits oiseaux qui font
tchip-tchip, cui-cui et splatch.
Je ne vous ai jamais vu aussi joyeux.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas?
En voyant les choses sous cet angle
je me rappelle comme la vie est belle.
Ou peut-Ítre qu'il y a trop de sang
qui stagne dans mon cerveau...
ce qui provoque un lťger dťlire.
Au fait, tu as dix cents dans le nez.
Ce n'est qu'une piŤce de 5 cents.
Vive le syndicat! Sales jaunes!
Comment peuvent-ils? Et cetera!
A me voir tordre ces poutres, tu dois
avoir les jambes en caoutchouc, non?
Mes jambes sont en caoutchouc.
De toute faÁon,
je suis aussi forte que toi, mon vieux.
Ah oui? Prouve-le.
Attends.
Laisse-moi t'aider.
Mon nouvel angle de vue m'a rendu
toute mon ťnergie.
Je frťquente mÍme une jeune actrice
brťsilienne retraitťe.
Si je les prends au berceau,
elle les prend un pied dans la tombe.
Salut les poteaux! Quoi de neuf?
Je divertissais tes anciens collŤgues
avec une histoire d'alcŰve, qui...
Super gťnial, on s'en fout.
Voilŗ des nouvelles de Bender.
Je suis amoureux.
Et je vous invite tous pour fÍter Áa.
On va s'en mettre une bonne!
SUGGESTION DU JOUR:
SOUFFLE DE RESTES
Eh bien, vous Ítes nombreux.
Il faut que vous goŻtiez les p‚tes.
On se fait une bonne marge dessus.
Alors, vous fÍtez quoi ce soir?
- Tu ne devineras jamais!
- Bam?
- J'ai rencontrť une fille explosive.
- C'est gťnial!
Je vais ajouter sept exemplaires
de mon livre de cuisine ŗ la note.
Merci mille fois.
Alors, Bender, parle-nous
de ta nouvelle petite amie.
J'allais le faire,
en portant un toast.
A Angleene. Elle a tout.
La beautť, le charme, et l'amour
d'un merveilleux robot tordeur.
En effet.
Flexo!
Attention, elle date d'une semaine.
Je rencontre enfin une fille bien,
avec des jambes qui tiennent...
et ce salaud de Flexo me la vole?
Je vais botter son cul de mťtal
tout brillant!
EspŤce de dťgťnťrť!
Toi aussi tu me dťÁois, Angleene!
- Ce n'est pas ce que tu crois!
- Bon sang, alors c'est pire!
Ecoute, tu n'as aucune raison
d'Ítre contrariť.
- Flexo et moi sommes divorcťs.
- Div... hein?
Nous dÓnons ensemble
en tant qu'amis.
Je sais. Ce qui me rťvolte,
c'est le vin que vous avez choisi!
- C'est la faute du sommelier.
- Excellent choix, Monsieur.
Ce Flexo, je vais le mettre par terre.
J'y crois pas.
Faire une fixation ne t'aidera pas.
Renverse la tÍte et profite de la vie.
Ma petite amie en aime
peut-Ítre un autre.
Va lui parler. Dis-lui
ce que tu ressens, en toute sincťritť.
Tu peux faire Áa ou Ítre un homme.
J'ai mis au point
un mensonge ťlaborť.
J'appelle Angleene, je me fais passer
pour Flexo, on fixe un rendez-vous...
et lŗ je la surprends avec moi
en train de me tromper.
Voilŗ un raisonnement d'homme.
AllŰ? C'est Flexo.
LA BOITE BRANCHEE
NUIT SPECIALE ROBOTS
T'as bu ton protoplasme?
On va voir qui aime qui.
- Salut, beautť.
- Salut, Flexo.
Depuis quand tu sors en semaine?
Ca ne te ressemble pas.
Au contraire.
C'est tout ŗ fait moi.
Flexo le fÍtard,
le tombeur que ces dames adorent.
Pour moi, une vodka-pÍche,
et pour elle, un cocktail de minette.
- Ca fera deux vodka-pÍche.
- J'espŤre qu'ils ont de la monnaie.
Matez le jaune au bouc, qui nous
agite son sale argent sous le nez.
C'est une insulte, patron.
Cet argent devrait me revenir
et aller grossir mes fonds secrets.
- Je graisse mes trucs!
- Attends. Pas encore.
Voyons s'il recommence
plusieurs fois.
- Tu es ravissante.
- Laisse tomber les yeux doux.
- Je suis amoureuse de Bender.
- Cette minable usine sur pied?
C'est peut-Ítre une usine sur pied,
mais pas un minable.
Toi et moi c'est fini.
Je te l'ai dit quand on a divorcť.
Tu ne trouves pas que l'ťpreuve
du divorce nous a rapprochťs?
Veux-tu danser?
J'adore danser,
mais tu as toujours dťtestť Áa.
Dans ce cas, disons que j'ai toujours
voulu me rattraper.
Hť, Scratchmo!
Mets un truc qui dťmťnage,
qu'on bouge nos fesses.
J'espťrais que la deuxiŤme fois,
ma colŤre se serait calmťe.
Hťlas, ce n'est pas le cas.
Tu ťtais si inflexible avant, Flexo.
Tu t'es vraiment dťcoincť.
Gr‚ce ŗ ma nouvelle carte son,
j'ai le funk dans la tŰle.
- Allez!
- Super!
Vas-y! Allez, chauffe!
C'est ca!
Flexo, que se passe-t-il?
Moralitť: Si tu veux qu'il reste
au fond, accroches-y un boulet!
Tu as toujours ťtť un sacrť numťro.
Oh, tu parles, ma belle.
C'est toi qui me rends survoltť.
Flexo, je commence ŗ me souvenir
pourquoi tu m'avais sťduite.
Elle est sťduite par Flexo, alors?
Je devrais en faire encore un peu,
pour Ítre sŻr.
Il est tard.
Je devrais retourner ŗ ma caravane.
Je t'accompagne. Un gentleman
doit prendre soin de sa cavaliŤre.
Tiparillo?
Tiens, mon garÁon. RamŤne
la voiture de la dame, et en douceur.
Il est encore en train de flamber.
- Ca fait combien de fois? 2 ou 3?
- Trois!
C'est le nombre de fois nťcessaires.
Ce sale jaune va avoir un petit
"accident de travail".
Don robot, on ne devrait pas attendre
qu'il ait un accident.
Tuons-le nous-mÍmes.
Bon. Bonne nuit.
J'ai passť une excellente soirťe.
Tu me dťposes? Chez toi?
- Quoi?
- Admets-le...
ce soir tu as ressenti quelque chose
pour moi. C'est ŗ dire pour Flexo.
- Je me suis amusťe, mais...
- Mais?
- Mais...
- Mais?
Mais...
- Bender, tu m'as piťgťe!
- Exactement, poupťe!
Je ne suis pas ton cher Flexo,
le type que tu aimes tant.
Tu aimes quelqu'un
se faisant passer pour lui.
Et si je t'aimais mÍme quand
tu te fais passer pour un autre?
Oh, j'aimerais croire
ou comprendre tout Áa!
Il ne me reste qu'une chose ŗ faire
dťsormais: Tuer Flexo!
Merci, Áa me fait plaisir.
Non, je blague.
- C'ťtait dťsagrťable.
- Tu te dis divorcť?
Tu bafoues l'une de nos plus
anciennes institutions!
Quoi?
Un seul mot et je balance cette poutre
non flexible. Badaboum!
Tue seulement celui qui a un bouc.
L'autre jaune, on n'a rien contre lui.
NON FLEXIBLE
Ca, c'est petit.
ArrÍtez! Je n'en vaux pas la peine!
Sans doute que non, mais je t'aime
et je vais lui casser la gueule!
C'est bon, La Pince. Maintenant.
Oh, Áa doit pincer fort.
- Flexo, Áa va?
- Oui. Ca n'a jamais ťtť mieux.
- Je te fais marcher. Je vais mourir.
- Tu ne peux pas mourir!
- Bender m'a montrť que je t'aimais.
- Mais je t'aime aussi.
Je sais, et je tiens aussi ŗ toi.
Mais j'ai compris que je n'aimerais
jamais personne autant que Flexo!
Mais...
Je t'aime tant que je veux que tu sois
heureuse, quoi qu'il arrive.
- Que veux-tu dire?
- Je veux dire que...
j'ai une poutre non flexible ŗ tordre.
Tu ne peux pas.
Elle est non flexible!
Je suis nul pour ce qui est de
soulever, alors je n'ai pas le choix.
GEL TORD-NICA
Merci. Encore un an lŗ-dessous
et j'aurais ťtť fichu.
Je me souviendrai toujours, Bender.
Moi aussi.
Enfoirť.
Flexo et Angleene ont fait l'amour
tout de suite, par terre?
- Enfin, tu vas cesser de tout tordre.
- Oui.
Je n'en aurai pas envie avant
trŤs, trŤs longtemps.
C'est ton angle de vision
qu'il faut changer.
A 90 degrťs, le bonheur est
perpendiculaire ŗ l'ťmerveillement.
- On en a assez de votre optimisme.
- C'est vrai.
Balivernes. C'est comme
dans cette chanson que j'ai ťcrite.
Voyons la vie sous un autre angle
Il faut que tu nous aides.
J'essaie de m'en sortir,
et ils me poussent ŗ recommencer!
La tÍte en arriŤre, tous ensemble
- Non, dans l'autre sens!
- Il me plaÓt plus comme Áa.
- Je suis triste maintenant.
- Ca va aller.

DIVERTISSEMENT A 80 DEGRES
LE JOUR OU LA TERRE
DEVINT STUPIDE
DISTANCE: UN JOUR DE VOL DE
CERVEAU DE LA TERRE
CONCOURS D'ANIMAUX
Enfants: Masque de la mort de Sam
- Nibbler est prêt pour le concours?
- Il devrait l'être, je l'ai entraîné.
Nibbler, couché pour le jambon.
Couché! Couché pour le jambon.
Tu es si mignon.
C'est qui qui veut un jambon?
Zooka barooka!
Le premier prix gagne 500 dollars
et un an de nourriture pour chien.
- Vous avez dit cinq cents dollars?
- Et de la nourriture pour chien?
Concours de rassemblement de moutons
Ce chien sera difficile à battre.
Regardez-moi ça.
Un mouton, deux moutons...
trois moutons.
La vraie concurrence
vient du crapaud-hypnotiseur.
C'est à toi, Nibbler.
Rassemble ces moutons!
Vas-y, Nibbler!
J'ai un concurrent, mon terrier
hurleur à carapace, M. Zoidberg.
Plus vite! Plus vite!
Rentre ton bide!
Tu veux être castré?
Tais-toi, sale cabot!
Gonfle-moi ces pecs!
Je devrais pleurer!
Je ne pleure pas!
J'adore ces trucs!
Serre la patte, Nibbler.
Allez, la patte.
Il a peut-être un peu faim. La patte.
D'habitude, il mange plus de jambon.
REMISE DES PRIX
NE PAS CROTTER
Le troisième prix est un baril
de cochons d'Inde de taille familiale...
attribué à Dave Spiegel
et son maître, Fluffers.
Le deuxième prix est un joli afghan,
fait de la peau d'un Afghan...
attribué à Bender et
son terrier hurleur!
Deuxième? Façon polie de dire
qu'on a perdu! Tu n'as pas assuré!
- Pardonne-moi, mon ami.
- Jamais!
Avant de vous dire qui a gagné,
nous attribuons un prix spécial à...
Mlle Leela et son animal mystérieux,
Nibbler!
Moi? Prix?
Lui? Moi? Bons?
On s'attend à une telle éloquence
de la part de la propriétaire...
de l'animal le plus débile
du concours!
DEBILE
Et le grand gagnant est...
le crapaud-hypnotiseur!
Gloire au crapaud-hypnotiseur.
Peut-être qu'ils ont raison,
Nibbler est peut-être débile.
Ne les écoute pas. On me disait
la même chose et je leur ai prouvé.
Bonne nouvelle. On devait faire
une livraison à la planète Tweenis 12.
Mais elle a été complètement détruite.
- C'est une bonne nouvelle?
- Ils ont payé à l'avance.
- Pardon.
- C'est bigrement bizarre.
D'abord, Rome de l'Espace
s'est effondrée.
Puis, Don Martin 3 a capoté.
Maintenant, c'est Tweenis 12.
- Cette planète est la prochaine.
- C'est la Terre.
- La planète où on vit.
- Je n'aimerais pas être de ceux-là.
Qu'est-ce qui lui prend? Il est comme
Zoidberg quand on parle de manger.
Maintenant, quoi?
Non! Nibbler, reviens!
Dommage que Nibbler ne soit pas là,
je vais devoir manger tout ce jambon.
Nibbler?
Nibbler, tu me fais peur.
Est-ce que
je deviens folle?
Est-ce que je paie toutes ces années
d'hédonisme?
Nibbler, au secours!
Ne me laisse pas ici!
Nibbler? Tu pourrais avancer
ton siège d'un chouia?
- Leela est revenue?
- Aide-moi! Mon cœur s'est arrêté!
- Tu n'en as pas. Tu es un robot.
- Oui. Bien sûr. Robot.
Fry! Ma peau est toute sèche
et clinquante.
- Mais oui, les robots sont en métal.
- Suis-je un robot?
Je ne comprends pas ton arnaque.
Je t'ai déjà donné pleins pouvoirs.
Ma peau!
Je suis un génie!
Pourquoi tout le monde est
si bizarre?
Zoidbie veut ballon!
Veut ballon maintenant!
Zoidbie veut aller dehors!
Je viens de vous laisser entrer!
Incroyable! Je pensais que
tu étais une boule de poils débile.
Mais tu pilotes un vaisseau spatial
adorable! Si seulement tu parlais!
Attends! J'ai compris!
Tu transmets tes pensées
directement à mon cerveau?
Tu dis que tous ces cerveaux volants
rendent idiots les gens sur Terre?
Ah... encore plus idiot.
Et tu dis qu'on se dirige vers
ta planète natale...
où vivent tes semblables depuis
la création de l'Univers?
Alors, l'Univers s'est créé comment?
Donc, le sens de la vie c'est...?
Toutes les religions se trompent.
Tu es tombé! Bonjour!
Des trucs pas bien sont arrivés.
Un train s 'est écrabouillé.
Vous voulez voir?
Personne ne sera en retard.
Le gouverneur a dit:
"J'envoie plus de trains."
- Allez!
- Attendez-moi!
Morbo comprend pas
son Téléprompteur.
C'est quoi la lettre qui ressemble à
un homme en chapeau?
C'est un T. Ça se prononce...
Bonjour, petit Homme.
Je vais t'exterminer!
Même le monstre du journal est
bizarre. Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire?
Je sais! Si on jouait au loto!
Si on achetait
des actions Internet?
A profit, Zoidbie veut acheter
à profit.
Regardez-moi! Je suis invisible!
J'ai compris ce qui se passe!
Vous êtes tous devenus idiots!
- Si on soutenait les Réformistes!
- Ah, ouais!
PLANETE ETERNIUM
Pile au Centre de l'Univers
SALLE ETERNELLE
16 km à l'Ouest du Centre de l'Univers
Bienvenue, ambassadeur à la Terre,
monde des pizza-baguettes.
Je rapporte des reçus pour
me faire rembourser.
Les quatre formes de bienvenue
à vous, Leela.
Nous manipulons votre esprit pour
avoir l'air de parler votre langue.
- N'ayez pas peur, mon enfant.
- Je n'ai pas peur.
Ah, bien. Bien.
Ton vrai nom, c'est Seigneur Nibbler?
Etrange coïncidence.
C'est par égard pour toi.
Le temps qu'il faut pour prononcer
une lettre de mon nom...
un milliard de cosmos naissent
et sombrent dans une nuit éternelle.
Oh, vous êtes tous si mignons!
Non, le Nibblonien est une race
ancienne et puissante.
Regardez. Quand l'Univers
fut créé lors du Big Bang...
notre redoutable race existait déjà
depuis 17 ans.
La première milliseconde
se passa bien.
Puis surgit notre terrible ennemi,
les Cerveaux.
Depuis ce temps-là, nous livrons
une bataille sans merci contre ces...
Le déjeuner est prêt.
Que le festin aux mille jambons
commence!
Pourquoi ces cerveaux maléfiques
attaquent la Terre?
Parce qu'ils détestent
toute conscience.
Les pensées des autres sont des cris
aussi agaçants que les rires en boîte.
Ainsi, ils voyagent partout...
pour rendre tout le monde idiot,
pour effacer toute pensée.
Effacer toute pensée? Mon Dieu,
comme des télévisions volantes!
Même nous ne pouvons les arrêter,
si redoutables que nous sommes.
Un seul être peut leur résister.
Un enfant du destin dont le cerveau
étrange l'immunise de toute attaque.
C'est lui, l'espoir de l'univers.
Le sort de votre monde et des autres,
repose dans son esprit spécial.
Mais quand vous dites "spécial"...
Votre attention,
les New New Yorkais!
Arrêtez de faire les idiots!
La Flotte se tient au périmètre
de la Zone Crétine, jadis la Terre.
Pourquoi Fry serait-il immunisé?
Parce qu'il ne se lave pas?
L'intelligence est supprimée en
attaquant l'onde delta du cerveau.
Chaque animal et chaque robot
génère cette onde, et certains arbres.
Cependant, Fry ne la génère pas.
Il s'est concocté un esprit qui marche
à l'aide d'ondes prises au hasard.
- Comme une robe faite de lambeaux.
- Oui, comme une robe.
Les Cerveaux sont aux ordres
d'un cerveau géant maléfique.
Seul Fry, avec son esprit supérieur,
bien qu'inférieur, peut l'aborder.
Dites-lui de l'affaiblir.
On s'occupe du reste.
- Vous pouvez compter sur moi.
- Non.
- Sur Terre, vous serez trop stupide.
- Nous avons tout mis par écrit.
Nous t'avons préparé un goûter
et des gants.
Je vais tout vous réapprendre, les nuls.
D'abord, les présidents.
Notre premier président s'appelait
George Washington.
Revoyons ça ensemble.
Qui était notre premier président?
- Un bocal à cornichons?
- Thomas Jefferson?
Leela! J'étais si inquiet!
Tu es une abrutie?
Je... dois dire...
faut... important... quelque chose...
Calme-toi, tu vas à cent à l'heure.
Ceci... toi pour ceci!
Merci.
Non!
- Feu chaud!
- Le proprof va aider.
Feu tout à fait chaud.
Oh, tombé Chester A. Arthur.
Cerveau. Cerveau rend gens idiots.
Non, Leela. Cerveau rend gens
intelligents.
- Tu vas battre plus gros cerveau.
- Plus gros que ceux-là?
- Zut alors! Où est-il?
- Sais pas.
Un cerveau géant c'est pareil
qu'un intello géant.
Où se trouverait un intello géant?
La bibliothèque!
Lamentable espèce humaine.
Ranger la connaissance par catégorie
la rend plus facile à digérer.
Dewey, imbécile, ton système
de classification a joué en ma faveur.
- Que voulez-vous?
- Je suis ici pour te botter le cul!
Dans tes rêves. Notre évolution va
bien au-delà du cul depuis longtemps.
Bizarre. Mon champ de stupéfaction
n'a aucun effet sur toi.
C'est exact, l'ignorance,
ça peut aussi être très dangereux.
Il vaut mieux que je pense à un
autre plan. Allez, pense!
Je pense. Je pense...
Aïe! Arrête ca!
Il a mal quand je pense! Peut-être
que je peux penser à m'en servir.
Prépare-toi à être pensé!
Leela, dis-moi à quoi je peux penser.
Je ne sais pas
à quoi penser.
Je dois trouver un truc.
Hardy Boys? Trop facile.
Nancy Drew? Trop dur.
Parfait! Bonfire of the Vanities!
Non! C'est insupportable!
Ils s'affaiblissent.
Nibbloniens à vos postes.
Préparez la Bébête à Câlins
au déploiement.
- Je crains que nous soyons mignons.
- Oh, mon loulou-trognon.
Prends ça! Je ne comprends pas
cette phrase-là, mais prends celle-ci.
Tu n'as pas encore gagné.
Chaque livre ici est une porte
qui mène à un monde virtuel.
Je t'y emmènerai et tu y seras
emprisonné pour toujours.
Berk!
Où est-ce qu'on est?
Un doublon d'or pour le premier
qui aperçoit la baleine blanche.
- Grosse baleine là-bas.
- Je l'ai vue en premier.
Attends! Pas baleine blanche!
Baleine matière grise!
Mais lâchez-moi! Je dois la tuer!
Adieu! Vous serez tous coincés à
jamais dans ce volume symboliste!
Suivez-le! C'est la seule issue.
Tu n'aurais pas vu un cerveau
géant?
Ouais. Je l'ai laissé repeindre
la palissade.
Tom Sawyer, tu m'as eu.
C'est moins amusant que prévu.
Que cette tranche de culture
américaine soit ta tombe.
- Non!
- Allons-y!
Orgueil et Préjugés
M. Fry? Mère me dit que vous êtes
un excentrique.
- Célibataire à votre âge!
- Moi, excentrique? Attendez...
Le propriétaire terrien le plus en vue
du Hartfordshire, M. Cerveley.
Je suis un cerveau gigantesque.
- Dites donc!
- Ce n'est guère galant!
Quelles nouvelles avez-vous
de la saison londonienne?
- Eh bien...
- Réfléchis vite!
Je réfléchis toujours très vite.
La baleine! Elle est blanche,
maintenant.
J'ai une idée.
Reste ici avec Queequeg.
Y a-t-il une Mme Queequeg?
Oui! Je suis libre!
D'accord, cerveau! Prépare-toi
au traitement par électrochocs.
Fry, ne meurs pas!
Réveille-toi!
Noooooon!
"Leela pleurait, tandis que Fry
gisait sous la bibliothèque.
Le cerveau géant riait de
satisfaction.
Puis, sans aucune raison, il quitta la
Terre pour toujours. La Fin." Voilà!
Il est coincé dans mon livre sans
intrigue et bourré de fautes.
Le cerveau géant, je gagne encore!
Je suis le plus "port"!
Maintenant, je quitte la Terre
pour aucun "raisin"!
Le cerveau géant a été vaincu.
Que ce qui doit être fait soit fait.
Moi... me sens... un peu mieux
dans mes facultés cognitives.
J'ai réussi!
Et tout ça, grâce aux livres de
la bibliothèque de mon quartier.
Et la vie reprit son cours normal.
Aussi normale que peut l'être cette
boule puante habitée par des fous.
Les habitants de la Terre ne se
rappelèrent pas les événements.
Sauf Fry. Et personne ne le croyait,
tout le monde se fichait de lui.
Je repris mon poste, toujours aussi
vigilant, en cas de péril sur Terre.
Et quand ce jour arrivera, que Dieu
nous aide, qu'Il nous aide tous.
C'est l'heure de changer
la coucouche.
Fin de transmission.

Le comique suivant est un habitué

On applaudit très fort

Super!
La Terre, quelle planète! Sur terre,

Sur ma planète, les palourdes mangent

Je ne dois pas crier assez fort.
Sur terre, on cherche des calamars!
Sur ma planète...

Donc, ces trois vers parasitaires
pénètrent une tête d'humain.
Puis ils s'approchent du bar et...
Un instant! J'en ai d'autres!
Toute ma vie, j'ai bossé ce sketch.
- Et ils l'ont détesté.
- Espèce de docteur homard givré!
- Vous ne devriez pas être comique!
- J'ai ca dans mes valves!
Mon oncle Harold était une grande star
à l'époque des hologrammes muets.
- Votre oncle était Harold Zoid?
- Je ne peux le nier!
Je suis fan depuis que

Achetez Moxie
Il est sacrément plus marrant
que vous!
Peut-être, mais si je lui écris et
lui demande une centaine de tuyaux...
Cette lettre est très personnelle.
Alors, j'écris avec ma propre encre.
"Cher oncle Zoid,
Bien le bonjour de votre neveu.
Le fils de Norm, Sam et Sadie.
Vous vous souvenez?
Je suis un docteur reconnu
à l'entreprise où je travaille.
Mais le rire manque à ma vie."
"De grâce, M. Oncle Rigolo...
apprenez-moi le genre comique.
Cordialement, Zoidberg."
N'est-ce pas charmant?
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ce griffonnage?
- Une lettre de mon riche neveu...
qui pourrait être
mon issue de secours de cet asile!
Allez, cours va!
"Cher neveu et riche docteur,
je peux vous aider à être drôle.
La première des choses marrantes
à faire...
est de transformer votre argent
en chèque et de venir à Hollywood.
Cordialement, Harold Zoid.
PS: Chèque à encaisser."
Vous avez entendu?
Je vais à Hollywood!

Tous Mes Circuits?
Oui, moi! Bender!
Alors, jetez un coup d'œil
à sa maison de Bel Air.
Oui, de ce pas!
- Vous êtes mon chauffeur d'eau?
- Non.
- On s'est déjà vus, une fois.
- Non.
Mais si, je vous embêtais
tout le temps.
- Vous vous souvenez, non?
- On m'a programmé à être occupé.
A moins que vous ne chauffiez l'eau
à 212 degrés, ça ne m'intéresse pas.
Vous avez une option particulière?
Je n'ai pas besoin de Bender.
Non, c'était l'autre type.
Moi, c'est Chaudière.
- Bon boulot, Chaudière.
- Merci. Appelez-moi Bender!
C'est ici que je vois oncle Zoid
pour lui parler de mes rêves.
Quand vous me reverrez,
ne soyez pas surpris si j'ai mangé.
Oncle Zoid! Vous pourriez être
encore dans le coup!
Mon riche neveu!
Approche-toi donc et offre à ton oncle
un bon repas!
Comme on se retrouve!
Un comique toujours célèbre...
et un riche docteur respecté
avec des patients qui survivent.
Tous deux dans un resto
comme ca nous arrive souvent!
- Alors, tu veux être comique?
- C'est mon rêve depuis toujours.
Ce rêve n'existe plus!
Tu n'es ni drôle ni talentueux!
Mais tu es parfait
pour l'art dramatique!
L'art dramatique?
Il est peut-être encore temps
d'abandonner la comédie.
Je monte un grand film dramatique
en ce moment.
Le scénario décoiffe!
Je le sais car je l'ai écrit.
Si je réalise et je joue...
mon retour sera grandiose
après 50 années misérables...
- de gloire.
- La gloire!
- Et moi je fais quoi?
- Ca peut être intéressant pour toi...
si tu finances totalement le film
avec ton argent.
Alors, partant?
D'accord. Combien dois-je placer?
Pas beaucoup. Pas beaucoup.
Un million de dollars.
Marché conclu pour un film
à grand succès à Hollywood!
- Que désirez-vous?
- Le pain est gratuit?
- Oui.
- On partagera ça.
- Il a quoi Monstro?
- Il doit filer un million de dollars.
Ca fait un jour que je suis ici
et je suis déjà un charlatan frimeur!
Je pourrais peut-être appeler
Calculon...
puisque je suis dans le spectacle!
- Depuis quand t'en fais partie?
- Suffisamment longtemps.

vous apportais pas de scénarios...
qui feraient de vous
une vedette internationale.
Oui, parle-moi du projet.
- C'est un film.
- Intéressant. Détaille un peu.
Ecoutez ca! Pour un investissement
d'un million de dollars...
vous pouvez être la star.
Et?
- Et vous aurez un Oscar.
- Un Oscar, tu dis?
Ca me sortirait du monde pourri de

Montre-moi le scénario.
Je n'aime pas la police

- C'est bien le même Harold Zoid?
- Ecrit et photocopié.
Mon Dieu! Une occasion de bosser
avec le légendaire Harold Zoid!
C'est l'une de mes idoles!
- Et tu me garantis l'Oscar?
- Oui, tout ce que vous voulez!
- Alors, j'accepte!
- Hourra!
Voici votre chéquier!
TOURNAGE:
LES TROIS MERCENAIRES
Mesdames et messieurs,
voici le réalisateur:
Le légendaire Harold Zoid!
Merci. Une intrigue plus classique,
ça n'existe pas!
Un fils ne veut pas reprendre
l'affaire de son père.
Et ca consiste à être
président de la Terre.
Le fils est vice-président.
C'est logique!
Coin-coin!
- Tu as dit: "Coin-coin".
- Non. Je croise les doigts!
Je ne vous le redirai jamais assez,
c'est un film parlant.
Je veux sentir toutes les émotions
de chaque acteur dans chaque scène.
Les Trois Mercenaires.
Scène une, 1ère prise.
Moteur!
Reprenez votre stylo doré, père.
Signer les projets de loi a toujours
été votre rêve, pas le mien.
Coupez! Coupez!
C'est un film parlant!
Donne dans le sentiment!
Et vous les figurants? Remuez-vous!
On est à la morgue ou quoi?
Les Trois Mercenaires.
Scène 10, 95ème prise.
Moteur! Et je veux
que ça déménage!
Monsieur! Ce n'est pas
au président que je m'adresse...
mais à un père!
Coupez! Coupez! Tu pourrais
pas montrer plus d'émotion?
Je vous en prie! Ce n'est pas parce
que c'est dramatique...
que vous ne pouvez pas faire
un peu les comiques.
Lancez des tartes,
pour l'amour de Dieu!
Non!
Coupez! Coupez! Bon, ça va aller.
On fera le reste au montage.
Et voilà, c'est fini!
Je vous verrai à la première!
Qui est quand?
Le montage est un processus
long et coûteux.
Mais on a tout dépensé en tartes,
alors ce sera vendredi.
LES TROIS MERCENAIRES
PREMIERE
Il y a foule! Cet Oscar
est presque dans la poche!
Je prie pour qu'il m'aime
autant que moi!
La Maison Blanche.
J'accepte d'être
votre vice-président!
Mais je n'accepterai jamais d'être
votre fils!
- Merci, lieutenant Smith.
- Bonjour, M. Le vice-président!
On va rater la première! Mon rêve,
c'est d'aller à une soirée à Hollywood.
- Donne 2 dollars au garage!
- Non!
C'est par principe.
En plus, j'aperçois une place!
FOSSES DE GOUDRON DE LA BREA
VU SUR LA CHAINE DU GOUDRON
Je voulais vous voir sur le toit
de la Maison Blanche...
pour qu'on puisse parler
à cœur ouvert!
Je ne suivrai pas vos traces!
Voici ma démission
en tant que vice-président!
Non! Mon fils ne m'humiliera
pas ainsi!
Je mourrai avant!
Père! Le rebord!
Le président est mort.
Félicitations, M. Le président!
Non!
Producteur exécutif
Bender
- C'est un visionnaire!
- Ils sont partis. Ils ont détesté.
Des épidémies ont eu
de meilleures premières!
Tu m'as dit que c'était presque
dans la poche!
C'est pour ça que j'ai dit "presque".
Ecoute-moi bien!
J'ai dépensé un million de dollars!
Obtiens-moi l'Oscar ou t'es mort!
Toi et tes homards pleurnicheurs!
Morts, t'entends? Morts!
C'est maintenant qu'il se lâche!
VARIETE QUOTIDIENNE
NOMINATION DES OSCARS
Quatre cents catégories et je ne suis
pas nominé une seule fois!
- Vous avez gagné un Golden Globe!
- C'est pas prestigieux ça!
- Je veux un Oscar!
- Alors, il faudrait mieux jouer.
Il ne s'agit pas de bien jouer...
mais de gagner le respect
du monde artistique!
- Et si on truquait les prix.
- Ca marche aussi!
C'est peine perdue. Le goudron
est trop épais. On s'est embourbés!
On a tout raté et on va mourir.
On a plus qu'à admirer le paysage!
Mon Dieu! Sylvester Stallone!
RIDEAU FINAL
MAISON DES ANCIENS
Tu vis ici? Je croyais que tu étais
une grande star!
Non et je suis même plus menteur
que toi!
Ma carrière s'est arrêtée
quand Odeurovision a été inventée.
Calculon va nous tuer.
C'est la faute de tous les autres!
Je veux que les gens pensent à moi
une dernière fois avant que je meure.
De quoi parles-tu? Tout le monde
se souvient de Harold Zoid.
Comme un minable type fini
et une relique oubliée!
Mieux vaut mourir maintenant!
Non et le Dr Zoidberb ne répondra
pas de cette mort!
Zoidberg s'en va!
CEREMONIE DES OSCARS
Je suis la tête de Joan Rivers.
J'ai eu tant de liftings
qu'ils ont dû s'en prendre au corps!
C'est vrai! C'est vrai!
Voici l'ADN de Jack Nicholson
sous la forme d'un gorille!
Restauration!
Voici l'acteur fini qui s'appelle...
Ah oui, Harold Zoid!
Allez-vous présenter un prix
ou êtes-vous ici pour en recevoir un?
Je suis occupant de siège.
Mon unique talent
est d'occuper l'espace.
Je ne gagne pas l'Oscar,
tu es de la bouillie pour chat!
Pas vrai, Boxy?
A présent, notre présentateur de la
1074ème Cérémonie des Oscars...
Billy Crystal!
Je sais ce que c'est d'être
un distributeur Pez!
Ca t'a plu, Jack?
Ca suffit, on a déjà une heure
de retard.
Notre 1er Oscar est celui
de la Meilleure Cinématographie.
Tu veux jouer aux morpions
avant qu'on mange nos chaussures?
J'ai toujours su que je mourrais
au fond d'un trou!
Mais un trou plein de goudron?
C'était quoi? Un dauphin goudron?
Ou un requin goudron?
C'est un tube creux
dépourvu de vie humaine.
Le métro de Los Angeles!
On peut l'exploser et s'échapper!
Oui, mais je sens toujours
que j'ai ma chaussure.
- A quelle catégorie ils en sont?
- A tout ce qui est technique.
Au scénario, je crois.
Il reste la Meilleure Boisson,
le Meilleur Acteur et c'est à nous!
Et les nominés pour
la Meilleure Boisson sont:
Star Trek: La Génération Pepsi.
Ils m'appellent M. Pibb.
Blanche Neige et les 7 Ups.
Celui qui va présenter l'Oscar
du Meilleur Acteur...
également acteur dans le navet
Les Trois Mercenaires:
Dr Zoidberg!
Boxy! Sois prêt à appuyer
sur la gâchette!
Et les nominés pour le
Meilleur Acteur sont:
Sir Lawrence Ooooo
dans Le Marchand de Vénus.
Tête de Ruche Gamma Sept X
dans L 'été fou des Bikinis.
Le Robot Machine à Sodas
dans L 'été fou des Bikinis.
Mark Jones dans
Comme ma veste était beige!
Et, à la place du 5ème nominé,
Calculon...
pour sa remarquable interprétation
dans Les Trois Mercenaires.
- Il s'est trompé de nom.
- Fais semblant, comme MarisaTomei.
Hourra! On ne m'assassinera pas!
Je vivrai un autre jour!
Un autre jour de...
tristesse refoulée et désespérée.
Et le gagnant est...
Et le gagnant, à la place
de tous les nominés...
est le légendaire Harold Zoid!
Quoi?
Merci! Merci beaucoup!
Après des hauts et des bas...
je savais que le plus important,
c'était de gagner un Oscar.
Mais ce soir, ce qui est vraiment
important, c'est d'en gagner deux!
Je rigole!
Ce qui compte dans la vie,
c'est qu'on se soucie de vous.
Que ce soit une foule entière...
ou juste un fan dur à cuire.
SOIREE DES OSCARS
PERDANTS S'ABSTENIR!
Merci, mon neveu.
Je peux mourir en paix.
Dans 10 secondes,
Calculon nous tuera.
- Harold Zoid!
- A l'abri!
- Où est cet Oscar?
- Tenez, cadeau!
Pourquoi s'énerver? C'est moins
frauduleux que je vous le donne.
Oui. C'est absolument magnifique!
Un jour, j'espère gagner le mien!
Alors, vous n'allez pas nous tuer?
Je respecte et admire trop Harold
Zoid pour le battre à mort.
Ouais!
Séisme!
A l'abri!
Que la terre tremble!
J'ai l'Oscar de quelqu'un!
- Enfin! Une soirée à Hollywood!
- Navré. C'est une soirée privée...
Oh, excusez-moi! Je vois
que vous êtes avec M. Stallone.

Grâce à cette bombe de laque,

- Mais c'est mauvais pour la planète.
Et alors?
On en a d'autres, des planètes.
Bonne nouvelle! J'ai une mission
très controversée à vous confier.
- Controversée?
- Oh, non!
Cette mission très controversée
consiste à remorquer le Juan Valdez...
un supertanker en orbite
rempli de matière noire de Colombie.
Du pétrole? Et en cas de collision,
s'il y a une fuite?
Impossible.
Le tanker a 6000 coques.
Contrairement à moi,
il est totalement étanche.
Quand vous aurez dépassé
les manifestants...
- Les manifestants?
- Exact. 6000 coques.
Pourquoi passer à un mètre
de cette réserve de pingouins?
Pour éviter le péage.
Le plein de confiture de secours
est fait. Allons-y.
Sans vouloir être hostile, non!
Je refuse cette mission.
Qu'avez-vous à râler?
Vous n'avez aucun respect
pour l'environnement!
Je vais me joindre aux manifestants.
C'est un scandale. Je vous ordonne
de rendre votre veste de capitaine.
C'est ma veste de tous les jours.
Ca fait 10 ans que je l'ai.
J'ai dit, rendez-la.
Alors Fry, ou devrais-je dire
Capitaine Fry?
Non, je ne devrais pas car
Bender est le nouveau capitaine.
- Bender?
- Exactement!
Etre capitaine, c'est une question
d'intuition et de cœur.
Un bon capitaine
n'a ni l'un ni l'autre.
Bender, qui est froid et rationnel,
est parfait pour ce poste.
Pour moi,
une vie humaine est facile à sacrifier.
C'est pas juste!
Leela m'avait entraîné.
Je m'étais assis sur ses genoux
pour piloter, sur mon dernier dessin.
Le nouveau est sorti!
Le titre de capitaine flatte peut-être
l'ego humain...
mais ca n'a aucun effet
sur ma puissante robo-logique.
Allons, du nerf, les gars.
On largue tout à six coups piqués.

Montrez votre approbation en levant

S'il vous plaît,

Il faut arrêter ce tanker en formant
un cercle humain de non-violence.
Pourquoi rester non-violents?
Et si on leur bottait le cul?
Ma petite dame, les culs de ces gens
sont vivants, eux aussi.
On s'est accrochés sans accroc.
- Repos, les gars.
- Je suis au repos.
J'ai le plaisir de donner
un surnom à mon second.
Dorénavant, vous répondrez
au nom de Wiggles.
Dans tes rêves. Est-ce qu'au moins
tu as lu le manuel du capitaine?
Ca y est. Quelle est la règle

"Toujours respecter
la hiérarchie", Capitaine.
Exact, Wiggles. Vous gagnez une
invitation à la table du capitaine.
La table du capitaine?
Quel honneur!

Ce tanker a filé à l'anglaise, mais
nous l'arrêterons ici, sur Pluton.
Réchauffez-vous avec du permafrost,
le caleçon long de la nature.
Si se frotter l'entrejambe avec de la
glace est mal, je veux aller en enfer.
Voilà notre réserve de pingouins.
Qu'ils sont mignons. On dirait
les bébés d'un chiot et d'un chaton.
Nous utilisons une marionnette pour
simuler un environnement naturel.
C'est adorable.
Cette médaille, c'est ma fierté.
Je l'ai gagnée en sauvant les enfants
de la Terre d'un kangourou géant.
La presse australienne en a parlé.
- Magnifique.
- Tu vas arrêter ton cirque?
Tu parles de médailles! Ce sont des
capsules et des tranches de chorizo.
Merci, steward.
Vous n'allez pas lever votre
verre à votre vaillant capitaine?
D'accord, je vais lever mon verre.
Au Capitaine Bender. C'est le plus...
grand des enfoirés, laid comme
un pou et bête comme un cul.
J'ai entendu mieux.
Si j'étais le chef,
je ne te traiterais pas comme ça.
Tu n'es qu'un vantard.
Monsieur, vous vous oubliez.
Fermez-la!
Etre capitaine est plus important pour
toi qu'être mon ami. Je m'en vais.
Comment ça? Mais, un capitaine
ne peut pas boire sans son second!
- Vous pouvez boire avec moi.
- J'ai pas envie de boire.
Alors vous m'excuserez...
je vois qu'on n'a marché
dans les raviolis que deux fois.
Trois fois.
Je vous en prie, buvez. Les robots ont
besoin d'alcool pour fonctionner.
J'ai connu un type...
Vous lui ressemblez.
Il n'était ni...
- Je suis un bon capitaine.
- Je vous aime comme un père!
ECOUTEZ VOTRE CONSCIENCE
NE POLLUEZ PAS PLUTON!
J'espère qu'ils liront ma pancarte!
VA-T'EN TANKER!
- Bender vole trop bas, et à l'envers.
- Il doit appeler sur un portable.
- Que se passe-t-il?
- Les 6000 coques ont une brèche.
Les inconscients, il en fallait 6001.
Ils ne comprendront donc jamais?
ALERTE A LA MATIERE NOIRE!
Suite de notre sujet tragique,
mais lointain.
La crise s 'intensifie sur Pluton,
où la matière noire se répand.
Les images sont vraiment terribles.
EFFETS SONORES AJOUTES
POUR ALLEGER LA TRAGEDIE
Personne ne peut comprendre ce
que ressentent ces pauvres bêtes.
Pétroleuse!
Lors du crash, le capitaine avait
0,8% d'alcool dans le sang...
ce qui est bien en dessous
de la limite légale pour les robots.
En tant qu'avocat, je peux vous dire
que vous êtes dans la mélasse.
Mais j'ai négocié. Ce sera 5 heures
de travaux d'intérêt général...
pour nettoyer tout ce bazar.
Cinq heures? Vous n'auriez pas pu
m'avoir la peine de mort?
J'aurais fait mieux,
mais c'est dur de plaider...
quand on attend d'être jugé
pour incompétence.
Bonne chance à vous.
Ne t'aventure pas chez l'ennemi.
Pour ne pas avoir les mains gelées,
mettez-les entre vos fesses.
Dans la poche de la nature.
- Je vais surveiller Bender.
- Il pourrait vous faire la poche.
C'est meilleur, fraîchement pressé.
Bender, pourrais-tu au moins
faire semblant d'être puni?
Nettoie aussi les parties noires.
Sont-ils noirs à plumes blanches...
- ou blancs à plumes noires?
- On s'en fiche. Ils sont beaux.
Hé! Les tarés, je vais manquer
de Pétrole hahn. C'est quoi, ça?
Il s'est enfui.
Le chef avait dit:
"Pas de câlins."
Bon travail, tout le monde.
Je vous suggère d'aller dormir.
Je resterai debout à chanter sur les
pingouins d'une belle voix de ténor.
Quelqu'un a vu Bender?
Bender! Ici robot, robot, robot.
Hé, les abrutis, vous ne deviez
pas nettoyer dehors?
Ils nous ont renvoyés à l'intérieur
pour avoir mal travaillé.
- Et mangé des œufs de pingouin.
- T'en as mangé la plupart.
Où est le capitaine Bender?
Parti polluer une autre planète?
- Bon Dieu, c'est encore ton capitaine!
- Il n'est pas rentré avec le groupe.
- Pas rentré?
- Non.
Il fait vingt degrés en dessous
du zéro absolu. Je vais le chercher.
Attends. Bender et moi avons un
différend, mais nous sommes amis...
et je vais lui montrer
ce que ça veut dire.
Au vaisseau!
Pourquoi ne pas y aller à pied?
Il n'était qu'à vingt mètres d'ici.
C'est moi qui commande, maintenant.
Quel homme!
Je le suivrais jusqu'en enfer.
Bon sang...
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a dans cette eau,
de la glace? Ca craint!

Nous avons quitté Pluton, et peut-être

Alors où sommes-nous?
- Vous disiez savoir piloter!
- Assez de reproches!
C'est affreux. La matière noire semble
être l'aphrodisiaque de la nature.
Comme un mélange d'œstrogènes
pingouins, de Viagra et de cantharide.
- Ca les rend ultra fertiles.
- A quel point?
Un pingouin ordinaire pond
un œuf par an.
Depuis la catastrophe, nos pingouins
en pondent 6 toutes les 15 minutes.
Et les œufs éclosent en 12 heures!
Et les mâles pondent des œufs!

Bientôt, il y aura trop d'oiseaux

Pluton et les asperger de pétrole!
- Peut-on enrayer leur prolifération?
- Oui. Nous avons un plan.
- Lequel? Nous ferons n'importe quoi.
- Tous à vos fusils!
Je déclare la saison de chasse
des pingouins officiellement ouverte!
Il n'y a aucun moyen de les empêcher
de se reproduire?
Les douches froides n'affectent pas
les bêtes de l'Antarctique.
Une mort rapide et quasi indolore vaut
mieux que des semaines de famine.
Oui, j'imagine.
Je me suis jointe à vous pour aimer
les pingouins, pas les tuer.
Cette fois, c'est la même chose.
Allez-vous nous aider ou laisser
souffrir d'innocents pingouins?
Seigneur, c'est inhumain!
On dirait Hong Kong! C'est d'accord!
C'est un bon vieux flingue
à l'ancienne. Armez vos fusils!
- Oh, ouais!
- C'est parti, mon kiki!
Ca vous fait plaisir!
Si on doit tuer des pingouins,
autant y prendre plaisir.
Si c'est amusant, ça ne peut pas
être bon pour l'environnement.
- Et faire sauter un barrage, alors?
- Oui, ça c'est amusant.
Allons préserver l'environnement!
Ca a été un honneur de servir
sous vos ordres.
C'est pour leur bien.
Ne fais pas d'orphelins.
Il faut tuer des familles entières.
Ils sont si mignons. Tu peux le faire.
Ca revient à tuer un petit majordome.
Je ne peux pas regarder.
Oh, non! Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait?
Pauvre petit!
Je suis désolée!
REMISE A ZERO: MODE HUMAIN
CHARGEMENT LANGAGE
1) SE BAISSER
2) SE BARRER!
Tu te cachais au milieu d'eux?
Bien sûr que non!
Ces sales rats de banquise!
Allez! Du balai!
Qu'est-ce que vous faites?
Tirez-vous!
- Ils t'aiment.
- Moi, je les aime pas.
C'est bizarre,
mais quand je vois leur petite tête...
ça me donne envie de gerber.
Mais avec amour.
"NE BOUGEZ PAS.
C'EST NOTRE SEUL ESPOIR."
"BANDE DE MAUVIETTES!
SUIVEZ-MOI!"
Arrêtez! Arrêtez de tirer!
- C'est moi! Leela!
- Désolé.
Pourquoi vous ne tirez pas sur eux?
Vous ne voulez pas les aider?
- Pas comme ca.
- Vous n'êtes pas une vraie écolo.
J'ignore si les tuer aidera
à préserver l'environnement.
Mais cette décision ne doit pas être
celle de gens qui tuent par plaisir.
M'est avis que vous venez
d'énoncer une vérité universelle.
Mais on a préparé 100 kilos de pâte
pour faire des tempuras au pingouin.
- Allez les gars, c'est eux ou nous!
- Non!
- Où sont...
- A l'attaque!
"NOUS NOUS BATTRONS SUR
LES PLAGES!"
Vérifiez qu'ils utilisent
toutes les parties de mon corps!
Je vengerai ta mort, fils!
Ils étaient si paisibles.
Je présume que c'est ton œuvre?
"Si c'est pas noir et blanc,
il faut leur rentrer dedans."
Allez, j'enlève mon smoking.
Les gars, c'est moi,
votre dictateur adoré!
Si seulement on avait une luge!
Plus vite! Plus vite!
C'est vrai, ils savent nager.
Ca me revient maintenant.
- C'est Fry!
- Wiggles?
Au moins ca aidera à réduire
leur population.
C'est hilarant comme la vie
est cruelle.
- Permission de monter à bord?
- Accordée.
On ne peut pas décoller
sans notre capitaine.
Et rapportez-moi ma luge.
- Tu as pu aider les pingouins?
- Oui. Enfin, pas vraiment.
La nature finira par tout arranger.
Ca ne peut pas être pire
que ce qu'on a fait, si?
Je ne sais pas.
T'inquiète. Grâce à moi, ces oiseaux
débiles s'en sortiront très bien.

DIFFUSE EN SIMULTANE
UN AN DANS LE FUTUR
LE TREFLE A SEPT FEUILLES
LE VIEUX NEW YORK
20EME SIECLE
HOPITAL DE BROOKLYN
ENSEIGNEMENT PREPARATOIRE
- Poussez, Mme Fry. On y est presque.
- Allez, fais-le pour l'Amérique.
Retenez-le, c'est la 9ème manche.
Deuxième lancé pour Crypool qui
se dirige vers un troisième strike!
Allez, frappe, branleur!
- Regardez, il est roux.
- Vous traitez mon fils de coco?
La balle heurte Groady.
Les Mets remportent le match!
C'est le plus beau jour de ma vie!
- Voici votre bébé.
- C'est ça, merci.
- Comment on va l'appeler?
- Choisis. J'ai choisi le menu, hier.
Je pensais à Philip,
comme les tournevis.
C'est une idée géniale.
Morphine, s'il vous plaît!
- Yancy, voici ton frère Philip.
- Je veux m'appeler Philip!
Moi, Philip! Moi, Philip!
Tu t'appelles Yancy, comme moi,
mon grand-père et ainsi de suite.
Ca remonte à Yancy Fry Minuteman...
qui a anéanti des cocos,
pendant la Révolution américaine.
Jusqu'à ce que je trouve un missile
balistique intercontinental...
tu devras te contenter d'apprendre
à craindre ce vaisseau.
Il est à moi! Il est à moi!
AUJOURD'HUI
(c'est-à-dire, DANS LE FUTUR)
- Allez!
- Bébé a besoin de chaussures.
C'est moi qui ai besoin de chaussures.
Ex aequo! On examine
au microscope électronique.
Le gagnant est le numéro 3,
au finish quantique.
C'est injuste! Vous avez modifié
le résultat en le mesurant.
- Ca donne quoi, pour toi?
- J'attends l'arrivée de mon cheval.
C'est mauvais.
En 2 jours,
on a acheté 4 chevaux et 2 jockeys.
On a un jockey étalon.
Il est parfait pour toi.
Tu l'as déjà fait dans une valise?
C'est une course de centaures!
Vas-y, vas-y!
Tu me fais un baiser
pour me porter chance?
Non, avec la langue.
Le gagnant est le numéro 4, Steven.
J'ai renversé des chats noirs
plus chanceux que moi.
Cheval-burgers, cheval-frites,
gâteaux et milk-shakes au cheval.
- Véritable langue de cheval.
- Ca a l'air appétissant.
Nos chevaux sont nourris au cheval
pour une meilleure valeur nutritive.
Une omelette sans cholestérol
aux fouets de cheval.
- Qu'est-ce que je vous cheval?
- Un coca cheval.
- Un Pepsi cheval?
- Non!
COMATONINE
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites?
- Ca.
Cher Dieu des chevaux,
parfois, je doute de ton existence.
Mais si vous acceptez de me porter
chance, donnez un coup de sabot.
Allez, numéro 6. Du nerf!
Ne fais pas ça. Qu'est-ce que tu...
C'est communicatif.
Le gagnant est Harry Trotter,
tout seul sur la piste.
Ca leur apprendra à ces chevaux
à se doper.
Mon argent, c'est tout
ce que vous pouvez prendre...
avant de me déposséder de tout.
Ca suffit!
Il me reste un dollar
et je compte bien le garder!
Vous ne réussirez pas.
Je n'y connais
rien en chevaux...
mais j'en connais un bout sur
ce qu'il faut faire pour 1 $.
La malchance ne s'abattra pas sur moi
car je m'appelle Philip J...
Il n'a pas de chance, celui-là.
LE PASSE
Kareem a le sky hook,
mais Philip J. Fry a le space hook.
Yancy va marquer
avec le space hook qu'il a inventé.
Hé! C'est moi qui l'ai inventé.
Voleur!
T'es pas le président.
Ca alors!
Un trèfle à sept feuilles!
J'ai le temps de mourir!
Phil remporte le match!
Les fans de Yancy sont bluffés.
On ne fera pas la fête au Yancy Dôme.
Veinard!
Tu peux te frotter les pinces.
Disons que j'ai eu du pot.
Et que j'ai truqué une course.
J'aurais gagné, si j'avais encore
mon trèfle à sept feuilles.
Et si j'avais encore mes cheveux.
J'ai eu votre message.
Vos nouveaux cheveux sont prêts.
Où est passé ce trèfle?
Je l'ai caché sans rien dire
à personne. Même pas à Scruffy.
- Il est toujours dans sa cachette?
- Oui, c'est possible.
Dans les ruines du vieux New York.
Il aide une fourmi à lutter.
- Ou il porte chance à un débris.
- Il n'en a pas besoin.
Je vais aller récupérer mon trèfle!
Certains tunnels
ont des barreaux métalliques.
- Tu sais les tordre?
- Oui.
- Bending est mon deuxième nom.
- Ah bon?
Oui. Je m'appelle
Bender Bending Rodriguez.
La zone
Voici l'entrée. Ma malchance
est désormais officiellement terminée.
C'était marrant.
Au cas où on s'ennuierait,
j'ai Tetris là-dessus.
- Regardez, là-haut.
- Le vieux New York.
La ville qui a inspiré un casino
à Las Vegas.
On a Manhattan
pour nous tout seuls.
Je peux enfin faire les folies
dont je rêvais.
Howard Stern
ne mérite pas sa réputation!
- Mince!
- New York est en ruine.
Vous vous souvenez quand Giuliani
punissait les piétons indisciplinés?
Qu'est-ce que tu dis de ça, Rudy?
LE PASSE
Le concours de breakdance
a lieu samedi.
Pour gagner le pantalon de parachutiste
de Jam Master Jay...
notre bande doit éclater,
pulvériser les plus forts.
Noticeably F-A-T, balance la sauce.
- Ton nom?
- Cosmique F.
- Ton style?
- Espace cosmique.
- Tes spécialités?
- Le moonwalk.
Le robot. La coupole.
- Ton nom?
- Cosmique Y.
- Ton style?
- Espace intersidéral.
Espace intersidéral?
- Tes spécialités?
- Le space-walk.
- Le robot.
- C'est le même que le mien!
La coupole.
- Tu as volé mes figures.
- Tu me traites de copieur?
Pourquoi tu me voles toujours tout,
Yancy? Vis ta vie.
- T'emballe pas!
- Essaie de copier ça pour voir:
La septuple toupie!
Il ment.
Personne n'a fait mieux que quadruple.
Ah ouais? Noticeably F-A-T,
rembobine la cassette.
Enfoiré de bluffeur.
- Phil, t'es un pro.
- C'était mortel, mon pote.
Si jamais je te revois
tenter un truc aussi dingue...
la bande pourra renouveler
ses pantalons de parachutiste.
Lâche ce trèfle!
- Allons chercher le trèfle.
- Où est ta maison?
- Apparemment, on est dans la 71ème.
- La 71ème? Jamais entendu parler.
- J'ignore où est le centre ville.
- On n'a qu'à prendre la ligne B.
Ca fait une drôle de sensation!
Ce train est à destination de Brooklyn
et s'arrête où je veux.
Attention à la fermeture des portes.
Réveille-toi, mon vieux. Terminus!
Mon ancien quartier.
J'avais trouvé des chemises, ici. On
avait brûlé cette bouche d'incendie!
Dans ce coin, un type distribuait
des tracts socialistes.
- Les photocopies étaient mauvaises?
- Ca, oui.
Les vieux comiques avaient raison.
C'est vraiment différent de L.A.
- Vous disiez avoir vécu ici?
- C'est exact.
- Vous avez connu Andy Goldman?
- C'était mon voisin. Pourquoi?
- Je suis un mutant né de lui.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il est devenu?
Je suis enseignant.
- Il a l'air sympa.
- Oui, quand il est sobre.
Bon sang! La maison dans laquelle
j'ai grandi est toujours là!
Bon sang, le temps a fichu
un sacré coup à cette maison.
Ce trèfle est un vulgaire déchet
sans valeur. Donne-le-moi!
Maman, à l'aide!
LA MEILLEURE MAMAN
Ouais!
- Yancy veut me voler mon trèfle.
- Yancy, c'est mal de voler.
Je vais te faire ta fête.
T'es mort!
Qu'y a-t-il? Kremlin Joe
a lancé l'attaque nucléaire?
Pas encore, commandant.
Yancy veut voler mes affaires.
Qu'il ne touche pas à ces bananes.
On en aura besoin quand la radiation
nous aura transformés en singes.
Le coffre à disques Ronco.
Yancy ne te trouvera jamais là-dedans.
La bande originale
de The Breakfast Club.
Je ne peux pas attendre d'être
assez vieux pour être nostalgique.
Reste en sûreté. Un jour j'aurai
peut-être besoin de toi.
Mon père a passé des années
à en faire un abri anti-aérien.
- Il n'y a pas eu de guerre nucléaire.
- Quel gâchis.
Le voilà. Mon coffre à disques Ronco.
Je me souviens encore
de la combinaison.
Trois.
Il est bloqué.
Le talon d'Achille de Ronco, c'est sa
fréquence de résonance structurelle.
Et voilà!
- Voilà The Breakfast Club.
- Le Breakfast club sandwich?
J'ai caché mon trèfle dans la pochette
pour que mon frère ne le trouve pas.
Allons-y.
Il n'y est plus! Tout a été emporté.
- C'est Yancy qui me l'a volé.
- Il s'est peut-être désintégré.
- Non, tout le reste est intact.
- Sauf Sports, d'Huey Lewis.
PARC POTENTIEL
- Pourquoi mon frère me détestait?
- Les frères se disputent toujours.
Il n'a pas eu l'occasion de te dire
qu'il t'aimait avant ta congélation.
Tu crois?
J'ai toujours souhaité que...
- Qui est cette figure divine?
- C'est mon frère, Yancy.
Et ça, c'est mon trèfle à sept feuilles.
Je savais qu'il l'avait volé.
Si c'est Yancy,
pourquoi c'est écrit Philip J. Fry?
Attends une minute. C'est mon nom.
Il a laissé son nom crétin
et m'a volé le mien.
Apparemment, ce bel Adonis,
cette Cadillac des hommes...
- fut "le 1er homme sur Mars".
- Le 1er homme sur Mars?
Ca aurait dû être moi!
Il m'a volé mon trèfle, mon nom
et ma vie!
- Et il m'a cassé la main.
- Sa légende demeure!
En ouvrant le coffre,
le trèfle n'y était plus?
Il ne restait qu'une belle collection
de tubes des années 80.
Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions.
Et j'en passe.
Mon frère m'a volé mon rêve
d'aller dans l'espace.
- Je ne pourrai jamais y aller.
- Tu y es allé ce matin.
"Premier homme sur Mars."
Ce Philip J. Fry est ton frère.
- Non, c'est moi! Il a volé mon nom.
- Taisez-vous.
En entendant "Fry", mon navigateur
a trouvé un film sur Philip J. Fry.
Il a ouvert mon calendrier à Friday,
vendredi, et a commandé des frites.

Résultats de la recherche
Philip J. Fry, astronaute,
philanthrope, PDG...
était un grand homme
qui mérite d'être évoqué.
Ce fut le premier homme sur Mars,
un exploit inégalé.
Ca aurait dû être moi!
Fry a fait fortune
en trouvant du pétrole...
dans le manoir
qu'il avait gagné à la loterie.
C'est le trèfle qu'il m'a volé!
Après sa liaison
avec le top model islandais, Njord...
Fry était en tête des hit-parades
avec son groupe Sept feuilles...
connu pour ses rythmes hypnotiques
et ses répliques mémorables.
Je suis connu pour ça!
Quand il m'a fait écouter ce morceau,
j'étais sûr que ça serait un tube.
Aujourd'hui, Fry passe la plupart de
son temps dans sa tombe sur orbite...
avec son trèfle breveté pour lui
porter chance dans sa prochaine vie.
Mon trèfle est là-bas.
Ce cimetière est loin d'ici?
- A deux heures d'ici.
- Bien. On va déterrer un cadavre.
Je vais chercher mes outils.
Ton smoking sera parfait
pour mon mariage, papa.
Yancy, grâce à lui, j'ai fini
le Vietnam avec classe.
- J'aurais aimé que ton frère voie ça.
- J'oublierai jamais sa disparition.
Le Wisconsin avait gagné le
Rose Bowl 17-9. Il me manque.
Je vais récupérer les vieux disques
de Phil pour le mariage.
S'il nous manque,
c'est pas le cas de son bazar.
Philip Fry
20 ans
Breakfast Club. Ca videra la salle
à la fin de la réception.
VOUS NE SEREZ JAMAIS
PLUS PRES DU PARADIS
Ils l'ont enterré dans la section
des héros? Ca m'épate.
C'est moi qui aurais dû être
dans cette tombe!
TOMBE DU COMIQUE INCONNU
JAMBE DE SHAQ
On a perdu Bender.
Et voilà, j'ai fait plier l'échine
à John Larroquette.
La tombe de mon frère!
"Philip Fry, le premier martien."
C'est un tissu de mensonges.
Ce n'était pas le premier martien.
- Ce n'était ni Philip ni un héros.
- Tu es 2 fois plus héroïque que lui.
Récupération du trèfle.
- Tu as une idée de nom, Yancy?
- J'en ai une en tête.
Papa a un cadeau pour toi.
C'est un trèfle porte-bonheur...
pour que tu réussisses,
même en breakdance.
Il a appartenu à quelqu'un de spécial.
Je sais comment tu veux l'appeler.
C'est d'accord.
Vraiment? Mon fils,
tu t'appelleras Philip J. Fry...
en hommage à mon petit frère
qui me manque chaque jour.
Je t'aime, Philip.
Et je t'aimerai toujours.
"Ci-gît Philip J. Fry,
nommé comme son oncle...
pour perpétuer son âme."
J'ai le trèfle et son alliance!
Désolé, les filles, je suis pris.
Fry, tu veux que je tabasse
un peu le cadavre?
Je crois qu'il a besoin d'être seul.
Il me manque le crâne
d'un des membres du club Mickey.

DE FUTURAMA!
LES ORPHELINS
J'ai donc donné les biscuits
aux enfants. Ils n 'y croyaient pas!
Ils étaient exquis.
Mais, je m'écarte du sujet.
Tremblez, faibles terriens!
Un jour, ma race vous exterminera!
L'un d'entre vous peut y aller?
C'est un bébé qui sonne à la porte!
Bonjour, petit bout.
- On m'a abandonné aussi, alors...
- Poubelle, hein? Je m'en charge!
- Bender, arrête! C'est un bébé!
- Un bébé quoi?
Ce n'est qu'une carte
de l'orphelinarium où j'ai grandi!
Leela, tu es invitée à une réunion...
à Cookieville dans l'Orphelinarium
Sécurité-Minimale!
Eloignez-vous du panier
auto-destructeur!
Une réunion à ton orphelinarium?
Tu vas y aller?
Pas question! Je ne veux plus jamais
revoir ces orphelins!
Pas après ce qu'ils m'ont fait
endurer!
Un œil! Un œil! Un œil!
Trop large ton champ de vision,
Un œil!
Comment peux-tu te moquer?
Tu es aveugle!
Je ne peux pas voir,
mais moi, j'ai deux yeux!
C'est atroce, Leela.
Imagine leur tête si on venait avec toi
et qu'on dévorait les hors-d'œuvre!
Ca me dérangerait pas d'afficher
ma réussite devant eux!
Que l'aventure commence!
COOKIEVILLE, ORPHELINARIUM
SECURITE-MINIMALE
Quelle décharge!
Comme dans le passé!
Les barreaux sur ces fenêtres
semblaient plus épais à l'époque!
M. Vogel,
vous vous souvenez de moi?
Leela, tu es une bonne à rien
et personne ne t'aimera!
- Vous ne cessiez de dire cela!
- Oh, c'était le bon temps!
BIENVENUE AUX ORPHELINS!
ABANDONNEZ VOTRE MANTEAU

Les tendons en apéro,
c'est pas mauvais!
Goûte ce bâtonnet de glace à l'eau!
Il absorbe bien le goût!
Regardez,
une photo de notre groupe!
- Je ne te vois nulle part.
- Ici, je fais bande à part.
Regardez un peu ce type quelconque!
C'est Adlai Atkins.
J'avais un faible pour lui!
- Un œil! Un œil!
- Myope comme une taupe!
Bon, il est temps d'aller dire bonjour
à la vieille bande!
Alors, tu fais quoi depuis?
- Je vis dans une boîte. Et toi?
- Je vends des reins, des dents!
Et moi vous vous demandez?
Je suis capitaine de vaisseau spatial.
- Génial!
- Je suis content pour toi.
C'est si bien pour quelqu'un
qui n'a qu'un œil!
Pas la peine de me plaindre!
Je suis capitaine de vaisseau
et vous, des perdants!
Oui, c'est vrai.
On est des perd-dents.
Tiens! Cette vieille Un œil!
- Ah oui? La ferme, l'aveugle!
- Il t'entend pas. Il est sourd aussi.
Laissez-la tranquille!
Elle mène une vie normale.
Elle n'a ni la grosse tête,
ni le delirium tremens!
Allez, filez!
Merci, Adlai. On ne se remet jamais
vraiment d'avoir été différent!
Arrêtez! Etre capitaine,
c'est une bonne profession.
C'est juste pour un service
de livraison de colis.
Un colis n'est qu'une boîte
avant d'être livré.
Je ne voyais pas ça comme ça.
Et vous faites quoi?
- Je suis docteur.
- Un grand docteur, c'est ça?
Vous avez l'air équilibré.
- Vous avez déjà pensé à l'adoption?
- Non.
C'est parfait pour avoir un enfant
sans rapport sexuel!
Vraiment?
Le gouvernement vous donnera
100 $ par semaine.
Cent dollars par semaine?
Navré de vous avoir taquinée
à l'époque. Laissez-moi me racheter!
- Je peux tout arranger.
- Vous allez les rouer de coups?
J'ai cassé le nez de l'aveugle,
mais ca n'a servi à rien.
Non, je suis spécialiste
en chirurgie oculaire.
Je peux vous faire un œil
en paraffine et le greffer.
Vous ne verrez pas mieux, mais vous
aurez deux yeux, comme n'importe qui.
Moi? Comme n'importe qui?
Fistons et fillettes,
voici tonton Fry!
Pourquoi ils te suivent?
T'as des bonbons?
Non. On appelle ça élever des enfants.
Allez, les morveux! On a douze
chèques à aller chercher!
Notre papa est un jouet géant!
L'opération de l'œil
est une grande idée.
Leela doit en avoir marre des crétins
qui regardent bouche bée son œil!
La chirurgie plastique, c'est super.
J'étais trop jolie...
alors on m'a rendu moins jolie
ici et ici!
Vous êtes fous! Leela n'en a pas
besoin. Tu es bien comme ca.
C'est si gentil. Mais pour une fois
dans ma vie, je veux être normale.
T'es mieux que ça, t'es anormale!
Tu devrais pas écouter les autres.
Je vais commencer
par ne pas t'écouter, toi.
Je vais me faire opérer.
- Bravo!
- Génial!
Demande aussi une poche d'encre
pour échapper à tes ennemis.
C'est l'idée la plus stupide
que j'aie jamais entendue, imbécile!
TACO BELLEVUE HOPITAL
Nous allons voir si l'opération
a réussi. Accrochez-vous!
Oh, je suis désolé.
C'est la mauvaise patiente.
- Ces yeux te vont à ravir!
- Elle était mieux avant.
- Non.
- C'est faux.
Regardez-moi ça!
- Je n'arrive pas bien à cligner.
- Ca viendra.
Je ne le fais pas trop car c'est
voyant. Mais, c'est sympa à faire.
Ca y est! J'ai cligné!
Juste à temps pour gâcher la photo!
Hourra!
MONOCLES DE LEELA
ŒIL DE ROBOT
Je n'ai jamais été si quelconque!
Je me suis confondue à la foule!
- Voici les idiots avec qui je bosse.
- Bonjour les idiots!
- Ils sont choux, c'est quoi leur nom?
- Les enfants ont des noms?
- Moi, c'est Nina. Lui, c'est Albert.
- Vous vous appelez tous Bender Jr!
Regardez! Mon premier chèque
du gouvernement!
Douze bébés humains,
1200 dollars!
Papa Bender, on a faim.
C'est quoi votre problème?
Tous les deux jours, vous avez faim!
D'accord. Je vais vous donner
de la nourriture.
- Des hamburgers à la Bender?
- Non, la SPA m'a repéré.
Bonjour, Leela.
Je faisais décolorer ma chemise
et j'ai pensé venir pour l'examen.
- C'est si attentionné.
- Suivez la lumière avec vos yeux.
Parfait. Un gars pourrait tomber
raide dingue de vous.
- Moi-même, je suis intéressé.
- Que voulez-vous dire?
Je ne sais pas dire les choses.
C'est pourquoi, je parle en devinettes.
- On peut se voir dimanche?
- Bien sûr.
Je ne sais que dire, c'est pour
ça que je le dis. A bientôt, donc.
C'est pas juste.
Je te préférais en cyclope.
- Il est intéressé car t'as deux yeux.
- Tu es jaloux.
Non! Attends, si!
Mais je maintiens ce que j'ai dit!
Je veux sortir avec un homme normal.
Quand je serai avec lui...
personne ne dira que c'est un minable.
Je pense le mériter.
Fais gaffe! C'est un docteur.
Ils sont tous pauvres.
- Non, en fait, ils sont riches.
- Quoi? C'est arrivé quand?
Tu rigoles, hein?
Ce n'est pas marrant!
O'ZORGNAX'S PUB
Q.G. DE ST RODMAN!
Il y a tout ce qu'il vous faut ici.
De la bibine, des cacahuètes,

- Vous faites tout ça, non?
- Ouais!
Alors, amusez-vous.
Mangez et buvez,
juste pour vous maintenir en vie!
Je dois faire des bénéfices, moi.
- Papa, Beverly me frappe!
- Tiens!
- Ce sont les vôtres?
- Ouais.
- J'adore les hommes responsables.
- Me voici, trésor!
Laisse-moi plaquer ces gamins
et on pourra prendre du bon temps!
- Papa Bender?
- Papa tente d'emballer...
une jolie petite poule,
alors va jouer aux billes.
Je t'aime, papa Bender.
- Arrêtez les câlins!
- T'es occupé. On se verra plus tard.
Petits idiots!
J'ai presque envie...
de vous serrer un à un entre mes bras.
On verra si vous aimerez ca!
C'est bon!
On va dans un endroit
qui plaît à tout le monde.
Ca a l'air merveilleux!

Je voudrais un extraordinaire bouquet
pour ma beauté extraordinaire!
Un quelconque, s'il vous plaît.
J'ai passé une merveilleuse journée.

Personne n'a évité de me regarder.
Je ne me sens plus si bizarre.
Leela, vous êtes comme 999999
personnes sur un million.
Chez Elzar
Gastronomie
Merci d'être venu voir
mon petit ami. N'est-il pas parfait?
Complètement.
Sachez que votre Leela
est une femme normale, à présent.
Adlai, arrête.
Pourquoi c'est si merveilleux?
On n'est pas normaux.
C'est ce qui nous rend géniaux.
Comme Dr Zoidberg.
- Un monstre qui mange des ordures.
- C'est vrai.
Le professeur est
un cinglé croulant amoral!
- Hermes est un comptable rastafarien.
- Tranquille, mec.
Amy est une empotée martienne.
- Et Fry a ce truc au cerveau.
- J'ai déjà dit pour moi!
Leela, tu veux être comme nous
ou comme Adlai...
sans aucun problème grave
psychologique ou autre?
C'est la question la plus stupide!
- Elle a raison.
- Voici le bulldozer!
- Je passe. Attention vos têtes.
- Au secours, on m'attaque!
Les fourchettes dans la poche
de gauche, les cuillères à droite.
Quel est le petit malin qui a demandé
le pigeon épicé?
Moi.
- Qu'est-ce qu'on dit?
- Il était temps!
Bien, fiston!
Et voici l'addition!
J'ai envie de faire caca!
Tu aurais pu y aller avant
qu'on parte en courant!
On y va! Par la cuisine!
Bande d'escrocs! Si je vous attrape,
je vous réduis en purée!
En voyant ce robot qui oblige
ses enfants à lui obéir...
- j'aimerais que nous ayons des enfants.
- Nous? Moi? Toi? Des enfants?
Il est temps d'arrêter cette vie
de célibataire et d'avoir des enfants.
Adlai! C'est le plus beau moment
de toute ma vie!
APPARTEMENTS DE ROBOTS
Fais-moi faire un tour
sur ton dos!
Papa est fatigué.
Faites la pyramide sur Fry!
- Raconte-nous une histoire!
- Une histoire!
- Bon, d'accord. Venez vous asseoir.
- Ouais! Une histoire!
On veut écouter celle-ci
encore une fois.
"L 'arrestation de Bender
par la police.
Le 3 mars à 14 h, Bender a été arrêté
pour vol à l'étalage."
Montre-nous la photo.
Regardez-le!
Il est 21 h, vous savez
ce que ça veut dire.
Papa en a marre de voir
vos tronches, alors au lit.
Les adultes doivent parler.
Allez maman, viens.
Voyons voir combien je me suis fait
de fric sur leurs dos.
- Il me faut une calculette.
- T'en es une.
Une bonne calculette! Si je déduis
la nourriture, le papier peint...
On me donne 100 $ par enfant
et ils me coûtent 110 chacun!
- Adieu mon buffet de cuisine.
- Fini les réunions parents d'élèves.
Les enfants doivent partir!
- Comment je tire la chasse d'eau?
- Va au lit!
Faire ce puzzle
de cette fabrique de tétines...
me donne encore plus envie
d'avoir des enfants.
Puisque tous deux on est orphelins,
on devrait adopter un enfant.
L'adoption? Oui, ça me convient.
C'est plus que convenable.
C'est suffisamment satisfaisant.
PIECES VOLEES DE L'HONNETE
BENDER ET ORPHELINARIUM
Le Dragon Impérial? J'ai un troupeau
de "vous savez quoi" à vendre.
Je vérifie. T'es un coquin, toi.
Environ 15 kg.
Quoi?
Bender, on voudrait adopter un enfant.
C'est l'endroit idéal...
car dans l'Orphelinarium de Bender,
les orphelins sont à prix réduits.
Que dois-je faire pour te refiler
12 orphelins dans les pattes?
- Désolé, on n'en veut qu'un.
- Je vais vous montrer ce que j'ai.
Je me souviens de ca.
On nous faisait parader et on nous
jugeait comme un morceau de viande.
- Je suis Albert.
- Un peu gros.
Et que dites-vous de celle-ci?
100% humaine, garantie sans vampire!
Si vous êtes fauchés,
voici un modèle peu conventionnel.
Affligé d'une 3ème oreille, mais empli
d'un sentiment qui doit être l'amour.
Une fois, j'ai fait 100 tours
à la corde à sauter!
Je n'arrive pas à me décider.
On va y réfléchir.
Les adultes doivent parler.
Au lit!
- Mais il est 10 h du matin.
- J'ai dit au pieu!
- Oh, ils sont si choux.
- Ouais.
Dans ces moments, ça me fait mal
au cœur de les laisser partir.
Bonne nuit, princes du Maine et rois
de la Nouvelle Nouvelle Angleterre!
Je vous arrête pour sévices
sur enfants...
vente d'enfants et falsification
du poids du bétail!
Si vous aviez des enfants,
vous comprendriez!
Pourrait-on adopter
l'un de ces enfants?
Tant qu'à faire, au lieu de pourrir
avec les pièces à conviction!
Regardez son oreille!
Hé, oreilles de monstre!
- Je me suis décidée: Adoptons-la!
- Mais il y en plein d'autres normaux.
Elle a vraiment besoin
d'un papa et d'une maman!
Oreille sur le front,
Sally reine des laiderons!
Leur remarque est juste:
Elle a une oreille sur le front.
Et alors? Elle peut être différente
et mériter d'avoir une maison!
Si tu la veux vraiment, je peux
l'opérer pour la rendre convenable.
Elle n'en a pas besoin.
Elle est très bien comme ca.
- Et toi aussi tu étais bien avant?
- Bien sûr que oui!
La ferme, Fry!
Je suis fière d'être différente.
J'aurais aimé en être consciente
à son âge.
J'ai aussi une queue.
Maintenant, amène-moi à l'hôpital
et remets-moi mon œil.
Pourquoi je ferais ça?
D'ici ce soir, l'un d'entre
nous n'aura qu'un œil!
En remerciement du cadeau
de Bender de 12 orphelins...
et d'un chèque de 1200 dollars...
je rebaptise ce bâtiment
l'Orphelinarium Bender B. Rodriguez!
C'est bon de retrouver la Leela
bizarre d'avant!
Tu es un vrai ami. Il n'y a rien
à redire si l'on est bizarre.
Leela, il n'y a rien
à redire du tout!
Tu vas nous manquer.
On sait que les robots n'ont pas de
sentiments, mais voici notre dessin.
Si on te manque, même un tout
petit peu, tu peux le regarder.
Hé, je fume le cigare,
pas une sucette!
Hé, qu'est-ce que...?
Partez! Allez, je m'étais
débarrassé de vous!
Je vous déteste!
Je vous déteste tous!

Il n'y a rien parce que vous n'avez

Tu as suivi ça de près
toutes ces années!
Zut! J'ai pas cotisé non plus.
Je vais faire quoi à la retraite?
- Je te croyais à la retraite.
- T'as rien prévu non plus.
Si, j'ai tout prévu. Je me mettrai
hors service.
Il est temps d'agir. Je vais m'occuper
de ma caisse de retraite.
Bon sang! Toujours 100 dollars.
Un sou est un sou. Il faudrait aussi
me mettre du talc sur le visage.
Il a raison.
Il faut investir intelligemment.

Vous êtes à découvert de 4 dollars.
Il y a moins la queue à la banque

Ca, c'est clair...
Roberto, c'est toi?
Bender! Salut, mon pote!
- Vieux dingo! Comment ça va?
- Pas trop mal.
Tout le monde à terre!
C'est un hold-up!
Moi aussi, je vais bien. Je prends
des cours de cuisine chinoise.
- Cool! Tu me files un coup de main?
- Tu parles!
Toi, le Rouquin!
T'as assez arrosé la plante. Dehors!
- Content de te revoir.
- Moi aussi. Vous êtes sympa.
- Voilà pour la peine.
- Merci!
Vous êtes en état d'arrestation!
Tirez-leur dans le dos!
Comme ça, ils vous voient pas!
COUR SUPERIEURE DE JUSTICE
ORIGINAL RAY'S
L'audience est ouverte.
Le Juge Whitey préside ce procès.
Chef d'inculpation:
Braquage de banque.
D'après mon chauffeur...
une banque est un endroit où l'on
dépose l'argent mal placé.
Ainsi, braquer une banque équivaut
au plus abominable des crimes:
Le vol d'argent.
En tant que caméra de surveillance
de la banque en question...
pouvez-vous nous dire
ce que vous avez vu, ce jour-là?
Je ne me souviens plus bien mais voici
ce qui s'est passé exactement.
Je suggère
que je sois rayé du barreau...
pour avoir présenté des preuves
qui accablent mes propres clients.
M. Fry, reconnaissez-vous le robot
à vos côtés sur cet hologramme?
Bien sûr! C'est lui,
le vrai voleur...
et je me souviendrai de son nom
toute ma vie. Il s'appelle...
Donne un nom! Tu vas passer
pour un idiot sur Télé-Tribunal.
Tu as raison. C'était...
Oui? Comment? Vous dites
que si je parle, je suis mort?
Oh, c'est pour vous.
Et l'autre hamburger aussi, je le
ferai avec tes poumons. A bientôt.
Je refuse de témoigner parce que mes
organes finiraient en steak haché.
Le 67ème Amendement.
Je ne suis qu'un poulet fermier,
mais je vois bien qu'on est cuits.
Si on plaidait la démence?
Quelques mois dans un asile de fous?
Fastoche!
Simulez la folie,
ça pourrait nous aider.
Avez-vous des preuves qui justifient
une telle requête?
- Ils m'ont choisi pour les défendre.
- La démence est avérée.
M. Bender, vous serez interné à
l'asile pour robots malades mentaux...
jusqu'à votre guérison.
Super! Le système a encore échoué!
M. Fry, vous irez à l'asile
pour humains malades mentaux.
Cet institut est plein depuis que la
pauvreté est une maladie mentale.
Silence! Les seuls pauvres
que je tolère...
sont ceux qui soignent ma peau
en thalasso.
Mettez-les tous les deux
chez les robots cinglés.

Je n'ai rien à faire ici.
C'est pour les robots cinglés.
Tu as déjà la moitié

Je suis choqué!
DR PERCEPTRON
Analyse Freudienne des Circuits
Bonjour. Je suis le Dr Perceptron.
Voilà qui va vous détendre.
C'est un malentendu!
Je suis un humain!
Regardez, je suis tout flasque.
Et je me plains tout le temps.
Oui, en effet.
Il faut vous détendre davantage.
Très bien. Maintenant, écoutez-moi.
Vous avez été admis dans cet asile
pour robots. Vous êtes donc un robot.
Diagnostic terminé.
Je fais d'autres trucs humains.
Je vieillis! Regardez.
Je suis l'infirmière Ratchet.
Venez avec moi.
Vous allez rencontrer votre camarade
de chambre, Eddie la Panne.
Le vendeur de voitures? C'est vrai
que ses tarifs étaient dingues.
Il est très nerveux, alors évitez
de le surprendre.
- Enchanté.
- On se connaît déjà.
Quoi?
On n 'est pas obligé d'être fou
pour parler tout seul mais ça aide.
Distributeur Automatique
Je suis une jolie fille.
Je suis une jolie fille.
- T'as eu une journée chargée?
- Mon voisin a explosé.
Aide-moi.
Comment prouver que je suis humain?
- T'as qu'à mourir. Ils te croiront.
- J'ai pas envie!
- Moi, je te crois.
- C'est vrai?
Moi aussi, ils me prennent
pour un robot. Je suis l'Unité 2013.
Je vais te présenter aux autres.
Fry, voici Norm. Tes dents reçoivent
toujours les messages de la CIA?
Ils n'arrêtent jamais!
Voici le menu de la cafétéria de la
CIA pour la semaine du 15 Mai:
Lundi, hachis Parmentier...
Dingo!
- Et lui, il se prend pour Lincoln?
- Il est fait pour ça.
Mais il a plusieurs personnalités.
Et toutes sont Lincoln.
Je suis né dans 200 cabanes
en rondins.
Lui, c'est Frankie.
Il se prend pour un robot de cantine.
Alors ils l'ont mis ici.
- Tu te plais à la cantine?
- Oui, ça va.
Pauvre Frankie.
Changez de place!
J'en peux plus.
Je veux m'en aller d'ici!
T'es fou? C'est génial.
Autant d'électrochocs que tu veux...
Deux Lincoln pour un Napoléon.
Et du bon pétrole brut!
Je ne suis pas un robot. On ne
m'insère pas des trucs dans le corps.
A part les gâteaux, et seulement dans
la bouche. Je vais mourir, ici!
Oublie ton estomac
et comporte-toi en robot.
Changez de place!
VISITEURS: DEMANDEZ
UN INTERPRETE DE CHARABIA
Les docteurs disent que tu contrôles
mieux tes explosions.
Moi, ce que j'en pense...
Sortez-moi de là. Je serais mort de
faim sans ce distributeur malade.
Pour moi! Pour moi!
Pauvre Fry. Il a faim de liberté.
On a adressé une pétition
au gouverneur...
mais il ne veut pas paraître indulgent
envers les gens condamnés à tort.
Au moins, j'ai des amis dehors.
Bender ne m'aide pas du tout.
Non, en fait, c'est pas vrai.
Tu devrais avoir encore plus honte
que d'habitude.
Calme-toi, chérie. Je traverse
les moments difficiles avec humour.
Les visites sont terminées.
C'est l'heure des disquettes de soins.
Aidez-moi! Je vous en supplie!
Ne t'inquiète pas. Moi aussi, on m'a
mis dans un asile pour robots.
Mais c'est presque fini. A bientôt.
30 jours, septembre, avril, juin.
Chocolat. Que vais-je devenir?
Non! Quoi, encore?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
- Vous pouvez sortir.
- Enfin! Précieuse justice!
Précieuse justice juteuse!
- Pas vous. Lui.
- Moi? En voilà, une surprise!
- Regardez! J'ai à peine explosé.
- Nous avons des traitements pour ça.
Fry? Vous êtes prêt à rencontrer
votre nouveau camarade de chambre?
- Bonjour, Rouquin!
- Roberto? Que fais-tu ici?
- J'ai braqué la banque à nouveau.
- Pourquoi braquer la même banque?
La première fois, c'était seulement
pour repérer les lieux.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a? Tu as peur?
Normal? Tu m'étonnes! Pousse-toi.
Je dois m'entraîner au couteau.
Non! Je t'en prie! Au secours!
Arrête! Police!
Baissez d'un ton, là-dedans!
J'accorde mon banjo!
Tremble pas comme ça, le Rouquin!
Bats-toi, si t'es un robot.
Je ne suis pas un robot!
Je ne suis pas un robot!
Pour répondre à votre question,
oui, votre ami est guéri.
Dieu soit loué!
Notez qu'il a cessé de croire
qu'il était humain.
Affirmatif. Je ne ressens rien.
Je suis un robot. Bip, bip, bip...
Vous avez fait une terrible erreur.
C'est un être humain, pas une machine.
Bip-bip-bip-bip-bip...
C'est l'histoire des héros
de la bataille de Waterloo
Bonjour, vous autres!
Fry, il ne suffit pas de croire
que tu es un robot pour en être un.
Ce n'est pas ce que je crois qui fait
de moi un médecin. C'est cette tenue.
Je suis un robot. Sinon, pourquoi les
humaines refuseraient mes avances?
Pour plein de raisons.
Echange vocal terminé.
Veuillez ingérer les sandwiches
conservés dans mon compartiment.
Voilà. Encore une petite minute.
Et c'est Petit Papy de Papa
qui est en tête...
suivi par Eternel Dernier. Et c'est
Traînard qui ferme la marche!
- Vas-y, Traînard!
- Salut, Bender.
Roberto! Je ne m'attendais pas
à te voir ici!
D'autant plus que je t'ai pas balancé.
Tu te souviens de ca? Pas vrai?
Oui. Allonge-toi et fais le mort.
Et n'en fais pas trop.
D'accord. Tout ce que tu veux,
mon pote.
Attends-moi ici.
Il me faut un déguisement.
C'est quoi, cet accoutrement?
Je me suis déguisé pour faire le mur.
Tu marches? Ou je te descends?
Je marche!
Quand est-ce qu'on s'évade?
Je dirais... il y a dix secondes
environ.
T'arrête pas maintenant!
Fois deux... Et je retiens un.
Espèce d'humain bon à rien!
INCINERATEUR
LaBarbra me l'a offert
pour mon anniversaire de mariage!
- Je vais te filer un coup de main!
- Les robots ne parlent pas en argot.
Du calme, mammifère. Mes logiciels
vont t'assister dans tes calculs.
C'est quoi, ce symbole?
C'est un plus, crétin!
Arrête de te prendre pour un robot!
On verra bien.
Pousse-toi! Je suis un rob-outil.
Tu n'es ni un rob-outil, ni
un frigi-bot. Tu n'es pas un robot.
Bien sûr que si! Mais j'ignore encore
quelle est ma fonction principale.
Ca ne peut plus durer.
Je vais révéler à Fry son humanité,
comme seule une femme peut le faire.
Tu vas faire sa lessive?
Fry, ça, c'est pour toi.
- Bip.
- Oh, c'est pas vrai!
Nom d'une coquille St Jacques,
c'est quoi, toutes ces bières?
L'alcool est ma source d'énergie.
Comme je suis un robot puissant, je...
Bip.
- Merci de m'avoir aidé.
- C'est rien.
Non, c'est pas rien!
Je tiens à te remercier.
Viens avec moi.
BANQUE
DE LA GROSSE POMME
C'est encore un hold-up!
Tu braques trois fois la même banque?
Ca c'est la classe!
Donne-moi le reste du fric,
les calendriers et ce stylo.
Et arrache la chaînette du stylo!
Police. Vous êtes pris!
Inutile de résister.
Les lasers ne traversent pas la vitre.
Fusils laser!
Baisse-toi! Les lasers!
Viens! Il y a un endroit où j'aime
me planquer après un casse.
Il a l'air d'un petit ange cinglé
et ivre mort.
Salut.
Je vous présente mon copain, Roberto.
- Salut, vieux!
- Enchanté.
- Sortez, les mains en l'air!
- Des otages!
- Dégagez! J'ai des otages!
- Hourrah! Je me rends utile!
Avez-vous des otages mieux que ça?
Pour leur prouver que je suis dingue,
je vais en tuer un. Toi?
Aïe! Ca va saigner quand mon cœur
va battre.
- Non! Prenez-moi d'abord!
- Oui! Elle, d'abord!
Arrêtez de me dire
ce que je dois faire!
J'ai la trouille!
Je pense à un nombre entre 1 et 10.
Trouve-le et tu mourras.
- A toi!
- D'accord.
- Cinquante... six, environ?
- Cinquante-six?
Maintenant, j'ai oublié mon chiffre!
Je vais te tuer,
toi et ton stupide 56!
Ne me tue pas!
J'ai le syndrome de Stockholm...
beau gosse.
Arrête, frère robot!
Le Rouquin! Tu arrives juste à temps
pour la prise d'otages.
- Avec qui tu veux être?
- Avec ceux qui vont te botter le cul.
Ne t'en mêle pas!
Il est trop puissant!
Négatif, humaine tyrannique.
Je connais ma fonction principale...
Je suis un droïde qui se bat
contre les robots cinglés.
Je ne suis pas cinglé!
Je ne suis pas convivial, c'est tout.
Ne joue pas les héros!
C'est pas remboursé par la Sécu!
Voyons si tu es un robot
digne de ce nom!
Les couteaux ne traversent pas
mon armure en titane.
A l'aide! C'est un droïde de guerre!
Aidez-moi!
Maman! Pardon! J'ai renversé
le liquide de transmission.
Non! Ne me broie pas contre le mur,
Maman!
Quelles sont vos conditions?
Ma poule, lave-le avant de le remettre
à sa place.
- Hourrah!
- Bravo!
Tu as réussi, Fry.
Félicitations.
Tu fais honneur à ma race.
Ce n'est rien. Je...
Du sang? Les robots ne saignent pas.
Alors, je suis un...
- Un calamar?
- Un humain! Je suis un être humain!
Pas mal non plus.
Merci de nous avoir sauvés.
Je vais continuer à ne pas laver
cette joue.
Tu es peut-être recouvert de peau
grasse mais tu as le cœur d'un robot.
Merci, Bender.
Tout comme en moi,
j'ai un cœur d'humain.
Quoi?

qui transcende les genres

- Fonce! Tu verras, c'est facile.
- Merci. Mais j'ai peu d'espoir.
- Je serai plus musicien maintenant.
- Ou peut-être que...
tu seras le plus grand musicien
de tous les temps.
Ça sert à quoi?
Gratte-le sur ta poitrine comme

Bouge-moi ces bras! Utilise

Ouais!

Je veux que tu sois mon nouveau

Ouais! Bender, le meilleur!

Bravo! Tu t'es fait déchiqueter,
et maintenant, tu chantes.
Nos deux rêves se sont réalisés.

- Les miens aussi. Même la monnaie.

Voici le type de gens qu'on aime.
C'était le meilleur solo de planche à

- On t'a entendu d'ici.
- T'assures un max!

Elle est quelque part dans ce container.
T'as prouvé que les robots cassés
n'étaient pas complètement inutiles.
Courage, les amis.
Vous inquiétez pas, je suis sûr que...
FABRIQUE DE PRESSE-PAPIERS
Ca devrait être interdit
de faire fondre les vieux robots!
- Surtout quand ils me complimentent!
- T'énerve pas!
Quand je suis contrarié, j'écris une
chanson. J'ai écrit "Satanés cheveux"...
quand je me sentais...
Ça parlait de quoi déjà?
Je pourrais écrire une chanson! Avec
de vrais mots, pas comme "Odelay".
"Odelay" est un mot.
Regarde dans le Becktionnaire.
BECKTIONNAIRE
Je travaille sur ma chanson.
Passe-moi le Becktionnaire.
Non. Le Becktionnaire des rimes.
J'aimerais défendre la cause
des robots cassés...
mais que puis-je faire?
Je ne pèse que 3,6 kilos.
Tu connais plein de stars qui font
semblant de s'intéresser à des causes.
On pourrait tous se réunir pour
un gala de charité à San Francisco!
- On pourrait l'appeler "Bend-Aide".
- Et tu pourrais chanter ta chanson!
Je te laisserai faire les chœurs. Mais
n'oublie pas que c'est moi, la star!
BIENVENUE A SAN FRANCISCO
Alors..."Les mains en l'air"
rime avec "C'est pas une affaire".
Point final!
- Ca sent la mort ici.
- Surprise!
On peut rester? Les couleurs de la
camionnette nous empêchent de dormir.
D'accord.
Mais pas touche au mini bar!
Oh, la TV! Quand on vit sur la route,
on réalise qu'on vit mieux sans.
Voyons ce qu'il y a.
Mardi, parc du Golden Gate:
Les monstres du rock alternatif folk...
vous couperont le souffle
à Bend-Aide!
Avec: Beck, Wailing Fungus,
et notre invité spécial, Bender!
Une partie des gains récoltés iront
au fond des robots cassés.
Bender, t'es célèbre!
Ce rassemblement de stars
te va droit au cœur, hein?
Aider mes amis défectueux est
la seule chose qui ait jamais compté.
Quand j'ai eu cet accident,
j'ai cru que ma vie était foutue.
Mais regardez où j'en suis:
Je suis célèbre, riche, adulé...
et tout ça, grâce au fait
que je suis paralysé.
C'est pourquoi je serai fier demain
de dire: "Regardez-moi!
Je suis un robot cassé!"
- Bender, tu bouges! T'es guéri!
- Oh, crotte! C'est un miracle.
Je peux bouger à nouveau.
Ma carrière de chanteur est foutue.
Je n'y comprends rien au showbiz,
mais c'est pas mieux comme ça?
Non! J'étais le héros des robots
cassés car j'étais l'un d'eux.
Comment puis-je parler
de mon handicap si je n'en ai plus?
C'est comme Christina Aguilera
qui chante en Espagnol!
J'ai une idée!
Je vais faire semblant.
- Fais pas ça au concert!
- Je peux pas m'arrêter.
Si je mange des cochonneries, j'ai
des trucs qui se forment dans la gorge.
T'es vraiment dégoûtant!
Je...
- Elles sont superbes!
- Berk! Vous les touchez?
Je n'ai jamais vu d'aussi belles
perles. Vous êtes incroyable!
Vraiment?
Enfin un peu de reconnaissance!
BENDAIDE
DONNEZ UNE CHANCE
AUX MORCEAUX
Gentils hippies, avec vos mains sales,
applaudissez les chanteurs...
Cylon et Garfunkel!
Voici une chanson
qui était superbe autrefois.
- On est chez nous.
- Allons gagner notre pain.
COLLIERS D'AMOUR FAITS MAIN
Achetez un collier! Sans ça, vous
ne trouverez pas votre moi profond.
Regardez ces couleurs!
Elles seront bien assorties à mon âme.
Apparemment, ça fait des années
que je fabrique ces merveilles.
- J'en veux trois!
- Donne-m'en un!
Je t'échange un poème pourri.
Levez-vous et branchez
vos magnétophones cachés pour Beck!
Avec en invité spécial,
Bender, le robot cassé!
ON T'AIME
BENDER
- T'es le meilleur!
- A toi, mec!
Mets le feu, Bender!
En général,
cette chanson ne dure pas 3 heures...
mais on était à fond dedans et j'avais
oublié comment ca se terminait.
Bref, on a une dernière annonce
à faire.
Bender, pour ta fondation
au profit des robots cassés...
voici un gros chèque en carton
de 14000 $.
- Ce fut une journée émouvante.
- Je ne sais pas quoi dire.
Alors tu devrais le dire en chanson.
Vous êtes prêts, les gars?
Mesdames, messieurs,
les vieux robots fumants...
c'est une chanson intitulée,
"Mon ami cassé".
On dit: Mon ami cassé est inutile
Moi, je dis qu'il est affranchi
Donnons plein de choses à faire
A mes amis grabataires
Du rythme!
- Il serait un bon porte-chapeaux
- Il n 'a qu'à se tenir à carreau
- Ou un bon buttoir de porte
- Il bougera pas, de la sorte
Ou un bel et immense Thermos
Avec un bouchon dévissable craignos
- Pour la soupe, c'est dément!
- Il peut servir de rangement
- Pour les jeans démodés
- J'aime bien être moulé
Mes amis cassés peuvent tout faire
Donnons-leur une chance de le faire
Ce robot a un secret terrifiant
Que je vais vous dévoiler maintenant
Il est plus proche de moi
Qu'un cul l'est d'un sofa
- Je ne vous dirai jamais son nom
- Qui c'est?
- Vous ne vous en doutez pas
- Vas-y, dis.
Je le chante haut et fort, ma foi
Son nom, c'est toi et moi
- Ne me change pas en levier
- Il souffre sans le montrer
Parce que je ne peux bouger
Ni les bras ni les jambes, hé!
- Ne me jette pas à la poubelle
- Que fais-tu?
- Car je sais pas faire des œufs
- Mais que fais-tu?
- Ne m'écrase pas contre un poteau
- Qu'est-ce que t'as?
- Parce que je ne sais pas danser
- Arrête!
Je vous le dis, mes amis cassés
Levez les bras en l'air
C'est pas une affaire
Je vous le dis, mes amis cassés
- Vous pouvez presque tout faire
- Arrêtez!
Arrêtez!
- Je suis une bête de scène!
- Espèce d'imposteur!
- T'es pas cassé, en fait.
- Mais ça va pas tarder.
Tous sur la scène!
- Attrapez-le!
- Attrapez-le!
Mince alors!
J'ai pas eu mes colliers!
Toi, larbin, lève mon bras.
Suivez-le!
Attention, les chanteurs de folk
vont nous en faire voir!
C'est l'année de l'emmerdeur,
ou quoi!
Le pont du Golden Gate! Appuie
à fond sur le champignon en métal!
GOLDEN GATE
AEROPONT
J'avais oublié
que c'était un aéropont.
- Or c'est pas une aérovoiture.
- C'est un problème?
Pas si tu as vécu
tout ce que tu voulais vivre.
- Je me sauve!
- Vite. Attrape ses pieds!
Zut!
QUAI DU PECHEUR
Un gros pourrait-il amortir ma chute?
Je suis à nouveau cassé.
Je ne peux plus rien bouger!
- Génial!
- Je suis désolé d'avoir menti.
Je voulais juste faire de la musique.
Je ne voulais pas faire de mal...
- ni aider personne.
- Arrête tes salades, tu veux!
Je sais que tu ne l'as pas fait
exprès. Excuses acceptées.
- Alors je peux garder le chèque?
- Faudra me passer dessus.
Je pouvais toujours tenter le coup.
Si t'as fini d'escroquer Beck,
on rentre à la maison.
D'accord. Laissez-moi juste faire
un truc pour me remonter le moral.

Allez, va chercher!
«a te dirait une promenade
dans une barque en cygne?
C'est dangereux, mais je maÓtrise.
Ce ne sont pas des barques,
mais des cygnes.
«a explique que les barques pondent.
Pauvres basketteurs terriens...
je m'appelle Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate,
capitaine des Harlem Globetrotters.
Pendant des gťnťrations, votre
planŤte a ťtť en paix avec la nŰtre...
Mais aujourd'hui,
sans aucune raison...
nous vous dťfions: Dťfendez votre
honneur sur un terrain de basket.
Personne ne relŤve le dťfi?
Aucun misťrable Terrien n'est partant?
- Que se passe-t-il si on perd?
- Il n'y a rien en jeu...
mis ŗ part la honte de la dťfaite.
«a ne se passera pas comme Áa.
Je relŤve votre dťfi,
bande de petits rigolos.
Toi, le vieux? Sweet Clyde,
gausse-toi devant lui.
Je suis peut-Ítre vieux...
En fait, j'en suis sŻr...
mais je vais remettre
vos Globetrotters ŗ leur place...
gr‚ce ŗ mon ťquipe
de super-mutants atomiques!
Et voici mes super-mutants
atomiques!
- Ils ne font que 30 cm.
- Ils sont encore jeunes.
Ce sont de super-garÁons atomiques.
Il nous faut des Cronotons
pour qu'ils grandissent plus vite.
- Ces particules ont rayť une civi...
- Bonne nouvelle!
Vous partez en chercher
ŗ la Nťbuleuse de la TempÍte.
Leela, regarde-moi!
On peut maltraiter ton visage.
Bon ŗ savoir.
Mon visage est un inconnu pour toi.
Ca te dirait de mieux le connaÓtre?
- Tu as le feu aux fesses.
- Tu refuses toujours mes invitations.
- On a des points communs.
- Je te dis que tu as le feu aux fesses.
Tu fais fondre la tÍte de Bender.
- Tout droit venus de la nťbuleuse.
- Pas trop tŰt.
Les Trotters ont dit que j'ťtais
un baratineur devant les journalistes.
Et voici mes invincibles mutants
nuclťaires.
- Salut.
- Bonjour.
Marv Albert en direct
du Madison Cube Garden...
oý les Globetrotters affrontent
l'ťquipe des supermen atomiques...
dans ce qui devrait Ítre un match
comme il se doit et sans surprise.
Les Globetrotters ont le ballon.
Clyde Dixon ŗ Bubblegum Tate.
Il traverse le terrain...
et voilŗ Curly Joe derriŤre.
- Il lui a chatouillť les fesses.
- Tais-toi!
Qui ose se moquer
des rois de la triche?
On est ici pour vous terrifier et
vous humilier, pas pour vous faire rire.
J'embarrasse votre civilisation
en passant le ballon ŗ Curly Joe...
et en le faisant revenir dans ma main
gr‚ce ŗ un ťlastique.
Bouh!
Peut-Ítre que Áa va vous enlever
l'envie de sourire.
Goose s'allonge.
Refusť. Un super panier
depuis le milieu de terrain? Oui!
Les Supermen mŤnent 45 ŗ 42.
Aracneon rťcupŤre le ballon
et le passe ŗ Thorais.
Voilŗ ce que peut faire un homme
avec un canon dans le ventre.
ArrÍte de parader,
espŤce de cr‚neur atomique.
C'est la mi-temps, les Supermen
mŤnent 48 ŗ 42. Un match ennuyeux.
Il vous manque six points.
Des commentaires?
On avait prťvu d'Ítre ŗ la traÓne
pour humilier la Terre encore plus.
Et les arbitres,
ils regardaient quel match?
Curly Joe, qui s'amuse de ses pitreries,
continue de dťvaster...
- Mais...
- Que s'est-il passť?
C'ťtait quoi?
Est-ce que tout a sautť ou
est-ce que c'est juste mon cerveau?
Quelque chose d'ťtrange
vient de se produire...
durant ce match opposant
les clowns aux monstres.
Temps mort, temps mort!
- Que se passe-t-il?
- On a fait un saut dans le temps...
comme un saphir sur un disque.
- C'est ma tenue qui provoque Áa?
- Non.
«a doit Ítre ŗ cause des particules
temporelles que j'ai utilisťes.
L'espace et le temps se dťchirent
aux coutures.
- Mince.
- Gťnial.
Et pour couronner le tout,
il nous faut un nouveau 5Ťme homme.
Moi! Je veux montrer
mes talents ŗ Leela.
- Est-ce que tu feras l'affaire?
- On s'en fiche!
On a 35 points d'avance et il reste
2 min ŗ jouer. Que pourrait-il...
Les Globetrotters gagnent 244 ŗ 86.
Un sombre jour pour l'humanitť.
Nous avons ťtť battus au basket.
- Et voilŗ le travail!
- Ca vous en bouche un coin!
Vous Ítes tous des abrutis
de 1Ťre classe.
Quoi que tu aies fait,
tout est fichu ŗ cause de toi.
Nos mŤres vont Ítre la risťe
de toutes les planŤtes.
Dieu merci ma grosse mŤre
n'est plus lŗ.
Assez avec ta mŤre dťpravťe!
Cette grave perturbation temporelle
est bien plus importante.
T'as raison, papy.
Ce micmac spatiotemporel pourrait
dťtruire la matrice de la rťalitť.
- Tate, qu'est-ce que vous en savez?
- Pas grand-chose...
mais je suis maÓtre de confťrences
en physique ŗ l'universitť Globetrotter.
- Vous Ítes le Bubblegum Tate?
- Je ne suis pas sa grand-mŤre.
On a un excŤs de Cronotons
dans les interstices subatomiques.
Oui, je vois.
Un truc qui requiert de si grands mots
peut dťstabiliser le temps.
- C'est grave?
- Absolument.
A cette vitesse, mardi sera jeudi
et mercredi, on sera en aoŻt.
Et jeudi, ce sera la fin de l'existence
telle qu'on la connaÓt.
Vous devez partir.
Demain, le cirque doit s'installer...
Nous continuons de faire des sauts
dans le temps.
Reportage spťcial ŗ 23 h.
Il est 23 h.
Le mystťrieux...
A la page divertissement...
la jeune chanteuse Wendy pourrait
Ítre... A gagnť 3 Grammys.
- Trouvťe morte dans sa baignoire.
- Intťressant.
Nous oublions ce que nous faisons
pendant les sauts temporels.
- Vous voulez dire...
- Oui. Comme ŗ l'instant.
- «a y est, Bubblegum?
- Pas encore.
- «a vous gÍne si je dribble?
- Tant que j'ai autant de libertť...
Bubblegum, je suis fan de votre
travail sur le terrain et en dehors.
- Je peux Ítre un Globetrotter?
- La ferme, la dinde.
Bubblegum, regardez: Les radiations
temporelles fluctuent ťnormťment.
COMPTEUR DE FLUX TEMPOREL
Seigneur, Áa remue
comme un petit cul.
J'y connais rien, mais je crois avoir
la solution. Il suffit de...
Je ne sais mÍme pas
ce que j'ťtais censť faire.
Trouvez la solution
avant mon anniversaire...
- Joyeux anniversaire, Amy!
- Regardez tous ces cadeaux.
J'espŤre qu'on s'amusera autant
ŗ mon anniversaire demain.
J'ai installť
un abri antisaut temporel.
C'est avec toi
que je veux le partager.
Fry, c'est adorable. Fais-moi voir!
Et c'est censť nous protťger
des sauts temporels?
Quand nous y serons tous les deux,
chťrie, le temps s'arrÍtera.
- Je peux vous parler de Fry?
- Leela, j'en serais trŤs honorť.
...c'est la pire imitation de
W. C. Fields que j'aie vue. Zoidberg?
Dťsolť, tu as dŻ m'ennuyer.
Fry est absolument adorable.
Mais il manque tellement de maturitť.
J'aime son charme de garÁonnet,
mais il est trop puťril.
Il n'est pas parfait. Tu ne veux pas
finir toute seule comme Zoidberg!
Tu disais?
La voilŗ, la Nťbuleuse de la TempÍte.
Sentez ŗ travers le sentoscope.
- C'est quoi ce truc funky?
- L'odeur du temps pur qui fuit.
Quand on a Űtť les Cronotons,
ca a dťstabilisť la nťbuleuse...
et causť des sauts temporels
dans tout l'univers.
- Bubblegum va m'expliquer.
- Voici des particules temporelles.
Lorsque la nťbuleuse
nous les envoie...
- elles font ces "sauts temporels".
- Vous Ítes tellement intelligent.
Et si on dťplaÁait cet amas d'ťtoiles
vers ces coordonnťes algťbriques?
Leur gravitť pourrait dťvier
les Cronotons vers le vide de l'univers.
Mais est-ce possible?
Il nous faudrait une sacrťe pompe
ŗ gravitť...
et tout l'argent de la Terre
pour construire...
DEVIS DE SACREE
POMPE A GRAVITE
BOURSE
GOUVERNEMENTALE
On ne vous donnera pas tout l'argent
de la Terre tous les jours.
- Il vous faudra combien de temps?
- Ce ne sera pas facile.
«a peut prendre des mois
voire mÍme...
Et voilŗ: Une pompe ŗ gravitť.
Assez puissante
pour dťplacer les ťtoiles.
Il reste le plus dur ŗ faire:
L'attacher sur le vaisseau...
Vous voilŗ partis, apparemment.
Doucement, Leela. Pousse
cette ťtoile vers le panier cosmique.
Il ne reste plus que...
quelques centaines
de milliers de kilomŤtres.
Et voilŗ.
Une belle nťbuleuse.
Je pense qu'il n'y aura plus
de sauts temporels.
- Super.
- Leela est gťniale.
Peut-on mieux fÍter ca
qu'en montrant ŗ Bubblegum...
la tenue des Globetrotters
que j'ai faite.
Fais-moi voir.
Et un procŤs, un!
Tu as merveilleusement bien dťplacť
ces ťtoiles, je tenais ŗ te le dire.
J'ai un truc pour toi.
Prix raisonnable, champagne sans
millťsime? Comment le savais-tu?
Personne n'a jamais pris le temps
de te dire quel capitaine tu fais.
C'est vrai, c'est si gentil.
Tu es intelligente, belle et surtout,
tu vas sortir avec moi?
Fry, essaie de comprendre,
s'il te plaÓt.
Tu es un homme, moi une femme.
On est trop diffťrents.
Je vais peut-Ítre organiser une vente
de p‚tisseries pour leurs femmes.
- Tu m'apprends ŗ faire des g‚teaux?
- D'accord, mais je lŤche le batteur.
J'ai ouvert du champagne.
Que faut-il faire de plus?
Mais rien, mon bon nigaud!
Il est temps de gagner le cúur
de Leela avec un panier ŗ 3 points.
C'est peut-Ítre le moment
de lui montrer ma vraie surprise.
- Fry, que fais-tu?
- Il est temps que j'aille au sauna.
J'ai appris ŗ piloter ce vaisseau.
Impressionnťe?
En fait, oui.
Tu te dťbrouilles pas mal.
La tempťrature du rťacteur
est acceptable.
J'ai aussi appris ŗ me servir
de la pompe ŗ gravitť.
- Alors, on sort ensemble?
- C'est lŗ que tu veux en venir?
Je t'en prie, Áa suffit maintenant.
Je sais qu'il doit y avoir un truc
ťtonnant qui te fera m'aimer.
- Quand je l'aurai trouvť...
- Je ne veux pas te faire de mal...
mais il n'y a absolument aucune
chance que toi et moi nous...
...mari et femme.
Vous pouvez embrasser la mariťe.
Il est rayonnant.
Bubblegum, on a ťchouť.
Il y a toujours des sauts temporels.
MÍme dans ce short de soirťe,
je me sens comme un ratť.
Tu as rusť pour que je t'ťpouse.
Bien sŻr que non.
- Tu m'as droguťe, hypnotisťe?
- La drogue, c'est pour les tocards.
Et l'hypnose, pour les tocards
ŗ gros sourcils.
J'ignore ce que j'ai fait pour que
tu m'ťpouses. Mais on est mariťs.
- On a le reste de nos vies...
- Le divorce est sans appel.
- Quoi?
- On se partage la vaisselle.
Je prends les casques du NFC
et toi, ceux de l'AFC.
Bien. Rebrise-moi le cúur.
Ne sois pas si dur avec toi-mÍme.
Tu as perdu la femme de tes rÍves...
mais Zoidberg est toujours lŗ.
Il est toujours lŗ pour vous tous.
Il faut que je trouve comment
j'ai forcť Leela ŗ m'aimer.
- Tu es peut-Ítre un amant gťnial.
- J'ignore ce que je fais.
Elle reviendrait si ton ami
ťtait un Globetrotter.
- T'en penses quoi, Bubblegum?
- Laisse tomber.
C'est dťsespťrť. J'ai fait un truc
pour gagner le cúur de Leela...
et je ne saurai jamais ce que c'ťtait.
Ma vie est vide.
Zoidberg.
Notre ťchec n'a rien d'ťtonnant.
On ne peut pas dťvier des Cronotons.
Je savais que j'aurais dŻ vťrifier
vos calculs de frimeurs.
Je pensais que vous saviez
que c'ťtait que de la poudre aux yeux.
Un Globetrotter fait toujours
les bons calculs au dernier moment.
Le meilleur de Bubblegum.
«a empire. Des points isolťs
avancent de plusieurs annťes.
Abrutis de retraitťs!
Pourquoi on devrait payer pour
leur retraite? Je veux de l'argent!
Je sŤche. Il va falloir convoquer
les meilleurs scientifiques de l'univ...
On pourrait dťtruire la nťbuleuse.
Qu'en pensez-vous, Curly Joe?
En la dťtruisant, on anťantirait
la moitiť de l'univers.
Au lieu de la faire exploser,
il suffit de la faire imploser.
Seigneur, Sweet Clyde a raison.
Ca formerait un trou noir
qui arrÍterait la fuite des Cronotons.
ArrÍtez de cogiter aussi vite, prof.
Il nous faudrait
un dispositif apocalyptique.
Un dispositif apocalyptique?
Le ballon est dans mon camp.
MÍme si j'en enlevais un,
je ferais toujours peur.
Tapez lŗ, prof. Je vous fais
Globetrotter honoraire.
En fait, tous les gens ici
sont des Globetrotters honoraires.
Je suis un Globetrotter!
- Vous avez dit...
- Trop tard, tocard.
Et zut!
On doit y aller, on est attendus.
Que la chance soit avec vous.
Je vous en prie, emmenez-moi.
Je peux grandir.
Tu peux dire des conneries.
Tu sais manier un ballon.
Mais sais-tu si tu es assez "funky"
pour Ítre un Globetrotter?
- Tu l'es?
- Oui.
- Tu l'es?
- Avec le temps, mon niveau va...
- Tu l'es?
- Non.
Il faudra t'y faire.
- Sois prudent avec ce dispositif.
- Je m'en fiche.
Je ne serai jamais un Globetrotter.
Ma vie, et par consťquent celle
de tout le monde, n'a pas de sens.
Bien reÁu.
J'ignore ce que j'avais fait
pour que tu m'aimes.
Je ne t'ai pas trompťe,
mais c'est peut-Ítre le cas.
- Si Áa l'est, je suis dťsolť.
- Ne t'en fais pas, Fry.
- Tu sais qu'on sera toujours amis.
- Oui.
Quoi que je fasse, tu n'auras jamais
les sentiments que j'ai pour toi.
J'imagine que non.
Le dispositif est en place.
Si on fait tout pťter dans le nťant,
Áa va peut-Ítre me rťjouir.
D'accord, attends que je mette
le vaisseau en sťcuritť.
En fait, je vais descendre prťparer
le dťtonateur.
Fry, et si tu prenais les commandes?
Elle est formidable.
Je me rappelle presque
ce que j'ai fait pour qu'elle m'aime.
Mais pas complŤtement.
Dťsolť. Moi aussi je sais ce que c'est
de ne pas pouvoir rťaliser un rÍve.
JE T'AIME, LEELA
J'ai dťplacť les ťtoiles
pour lui ťcrire un mot d'amour.
- Dťtonation dans trois, deux, un.
- Non!
Est-ce que tu l'as vu?
- L'explosion?
- Non, pas l'explosion.
Quoi alors?
Rien.

DURANT LE TOURNAGE DE CET EPISODE
JE SORS AVEC UN ROBOT
Vous entrez
dans un royaume étrange.
Peut-ętre qu'il est magique, ou qu'il
s 'y trouve un monstre. Le deuxičme.
Préparez-vous ŕ ouvrir
la Porte de l'effroi.
Découvrez le destin de Clyde Smith...
un joueur professionnel
sur le point d'avoir un accident.
Un casino oů je gagne?
La voiture a dű me tuer.
Je dois ętre au paradis.
Je gagne ŕ tous les coups?
Je vais m'ennuyer.
Je dois ętre... en enfer!
Vous n'ętes ni au paradis ni en enfer,
mais dans un avion.
Un monstre détruit l'avion.
Vous devez me croire!
Pourquoi je vous croirais?
Vous ętes Hitler.
Eva Braun, aidez-moi!
- J'en étais sűr.
- Je viens de voir un truc géant:
Un ballon de toutes les couleurs
de l'arc-en-ciel...
et męme d'autres.
C'était si beau que j'en ai pleuré.
- Devant un magasin de chaussures?
- Oui.
C'est un étudiant, un attrape-client.
C'était peut-ętre
un étudiant déguisé...
mais ŕ cet instant, mon cśur et celui
de la Création n'ont fait qu'un.
- Génial.
- Ça nous arrive tout le temps.
- On n'en fait pas tout un plat.
- Vous ętes trop blasés!
On est en l'an 3000 et vous restez lŕ
ŕ rien faire comme en l'an 2000.
Rien faire? A l'époque de la
découverte du génome humain...
et des boys band?
Oui. Mais on est dans le futur.
Je devrais réaliser mes fantasmes.
- Vous savez ce qui serait marrant?
- Comment le saurais-je?
On devrait emmener Fry
faire tout ce dont il ręve.
- Tout?
- Sauf ca.
CHEZ SAL. DEMOLISSEUR
Votre fantasme,
c'est de détruire une plančte?
Oui.
Elles n'ont jamais rien fait pour moi.
L'activité la plus banale
a presque l'air excitante, avec toi.
- Ensuite?
- Allons au bord de l'univers.
- Super!
- C'est marrant, on vit ici...
mais on ne fait ca
que quand on a de la visite.
Et voilŕ! Le bord de l'univers.
VUE PANORAMIQUE
DU BORD DE L'UNIVERS
Trop top. Il y a une infinité
d'univers parallčles?
- Non, seulement deux.
- J'imagine que ça suffit.
Ras-le-bol du Bender parallčle
qui crâne avec son chapeau.
Passons au fantasme suivant de Fry.
Saluez votre maître,
misérables mortels.
JURASSIC PARK POUR ENFANTS
- Maman, qu'est-ce qu'il a?
- Ne le regarde pas.
C'était génial.
Donnons-lui une friandise.
DINO-REPAS
5 cents
Garde les mains ŕ plat.
Sa langue me chatouille.
DE NOUVELLES MAINS
EN UNE HEURE
Ces mains sont super.
Je les roderai ce soir.
Ça a presque pris 1 h 30.
Plus que 2 fantasmes: Ętre invisible
dans une chocolaterie...
et avoir une liaison avec une star.
Je peux te frapper
pour que tu le croies vraiment.
Attends. Tu peux rencontrer
n'importe quelle star.
- Vraiment?
- Tu devrais lire les dirigeables.
"Téléchargez une star sur Internet."
Que dois-je comprendre?
C'est simple. Tu peux télécharger
une star dans un robot vierge.
J'ai une idée. Faisons-le.
C'est parti pour l'Internet.

Vous n'avez rien du genre Lucy Liu?
Non.
En revanche, nous avons Lucy Liu.

Tu vas rester lŕ,
ŕ la fixer comme ca?
Je trouve ça trčs attirant,
Philip J. Fry.
Vous voyez? Elle m'adore.
Sans blague.
Elle est programmée pour.
Mais c'est Lucy Liu, la seule
vraie actrice du 21čme sičcle.
Elle est plus qu'un logiciel.
Tu veux t'inscrire en ligne?
- Pas maintenant.
- Je te le rappellerai, étalon.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire?
- Tu veux t'inscrire?
- J'ai dit plus tard.
Quand je ne peux plus rien avaler...

Elle est restée coincée,

C'est ça l'amour pour vous.
Des humains avec des robots...
Pas étonnant que je sois célibataire.
Toutes les femmes robots potables
sont avec des humains!
C'est la décision de Fry.
Il s'est trompé.
Il est temps d'intervenir.
Elle ne t'aime pas.
C'est une machine...
Laisse nos femmes tranquilles!
Tu as la fičvre du métal!
J'aime un robot,
qu'est-ce que ça peut faire?
Il n'a jamais pris de cours d'hygične.
Il n'a pas vu le film de propagande.
Heureusement que j'en ai toujours

JE SUIS SORTI AVEC UN ROBOT!

C'est agréable,

Non merci.

Tu veux venir chez moi?
On pourra se peloter.
Tu habites en face.
Ça en fait de la route,

Que remarquez-vous d'anormal?
Billy aurait dű travailler dur

Sortir avec un robot, c'est répugnant.

- Ferme-la toi-męme.
- Enfin tu lui tiens tęte!
Męme s'il a totalement raison.
Nous devons mettre fin

Tu encourages un amour malsain.
Si tu refuses de fermer,
ce n'est pas ton PC qui va planter.
Pourquoi on fermerait? Le principe
d'Internet, c'est le libre échange.

Quelqu'un a des ennuis.
N'entrez pas. Quelqu'un essaie de

Et c'est tout ce que j'ai.
Ça, et la plus grosse pépite du monde.
Je l'ai téléchargée

Si tu aimes la vraie Lucy,

tu dois supprimer ce robot.
Je suis désolé.
Serre-moi fort, Liu-Bot.
EFFACER
Je me souviendrai toujours de toi.
Mémoire effacée.
Je sais que ça fait mal.
Mais au moins tu n'as plus

TOUT SE TERMINE BIEN A ROSWELL
Si une supernova qui explose...
fait comme ma vieille Chevy Nova,
ca va illuminer le ciel.
Celui qui ratera ça
le regrettera toute sa vie.
Fry, tu nous fais du pop-corn?
Pop-corn surprise
Dépêche, le micro-ondes.
Je suis pressé.
NE PAS METTRE
AU MICRO-ONDES
- Pourquoi ça sent le bleu, ici?
- Fry, viens vite. Ca commence.
Mise au point.
Quel est le délire
qui vous fait hurler comme ça?
J'ai la tête qui tourne.
Le pop-corn est prêt.
Il a pas vraiment fait "pop".
Je sais pas ce qui s'est passé, mais
on a ramassé des pendules. Rentrons.
Pourquoi y a si peu de circulation?
Qu'est-ce que cette couche d'ozone
fait là? La Terre n'en a pas.
ALERTE
Quel vacarme!
Il n'y a pas de signal GPS.
Le système de navigation patauge.
- On va s'écraser!
- Pas si je peux l'empêcher.
Je ne peux pas.
Mettez tous vos ceintures.
Elles tuent plus de gens
qu'elles n'en sauvent.
- Bender, ça va?
- Bof! J'essaye de remuer mon pied.
Voilà le plan. Zoidberg ramasse
les morceaux. Nous, on fait une pause.
Zoidberg ramasse encore un morceau.
La foule est en délire!
Qu'est-ce que...
J'ai caché plein de découvertes
top-secrètes sous des draps...
mais je n'ai jamais rien découvert
d'aussi incroyable que ça.
Les restes
d'un vaisseau extraterrestre.
Mon garçon,
je ne m'avance pas en disant...
L'année 1947
va être une année très animée...
dans la ville de Roswell,
au Nouveau Mexique.
BASE AERIENNE DE ROSWELL
Remarquable.
Notre chronographe de haute précision
indique qu'on est le 9 juillet 1947...
ce qui explique pourquoi il s'est
transformé en calendrier à pin-up.
Vous voulez dire
qu'on a voyagé dans le temps?
Un idiot a dû mettre du métal
dans le micro-ondes.
Et les radiations du four...
associées aux gravitons
et aux gravioli de la supernova...
- nous ont propulsés dans le temps.
- Vous avez vu le journal?
Ils vont rénover le gymnase?
Foutaises!
Non, là:
"Découverte d'une soucoupe volante."
C'est pas une soucoupe volante.
C'est mon cul!
Mon Dieu! La soucoupe qui s'est
écrasée à Roswell, c'était nous.
Et l'extraterrestre
qu'ils ont capturé c'était... c'était...
Vous faites quoi ce soir, les mecs?
Je suis partant pour tout.
Grâce à nous, l'espace a un nouveau
trou, mais il se referme très vite.
Notre seul espoir de rentrer à notre
époque est d'y repasser dans disons...
exactement 24 heures.
Il reste les cendriers à réparer.
Ils seront prêts dans 10 heures.
Tu en as huit. Mais le plus urgent,
c'est le micro-ondes.
Sans micro-ondes,
impossible de rentrer.
On va en acheter un quelque part.
Glissez-vous dans la base
et récupérez le corps de Bender.
J'irai voir mon grand-père Enus.
Il était en poste à Roswell.
Ne t'approche pas de lui, crétin!
Tu ne dois pas modifier le passé.
Ne fais rien qui affecte quelque
chose, à moins de devoir le faire...
- Auquel cas, ne fais pas rien.
- Pigé.
Si tu devais tuer ton grand-père,
tu cesserais d'exister.
Exister,
c'est mon occupation principale!
- Que faites-vous ici?
- D'accord, M. L'agent, je circule.
Pourquoi êtes-vous sur Terre?
Je me pose la question tous les jours.
AEROSOL MULTI-USAGES
Enus!
Nettoie ces latrines.
Je veux pouvoir bouffer dessus.
- Comptez sur moi, Sergent.
- C'est mon grand-père, Enus.
Prépare mon déjeuner.
Qu'il soit dans les toilettes à 12h00.
La Jeep va le renverser
et je n'existerai plus!
Tu t'es presque fait renverser.
J'ai de la chance que tu m'aies poussé
sur ces baïonnettes rouillées.
Arrête d'intervenir sur l'histoire.
J'ai pas envie de tout réapprendre.
J'avais pas le choix.
J'allais ne plus exister.
Je me suis senti disparaître,
comme Greg Kinnear.
Merci, soldat.
Je vais faire le déjeuner du sergent.
Tripoter du poulet cru, c'est super!
Et j'adore me lécher les doigts.
Faut qu'on te sorte de là.
Ca va aller, papa.
- Je dois demander au sergent.
- Pas le temps. Cours. Sauve ta peau!

Y a qu'à l'imiter.
T'as un four micro-ondes, mon pote?
Je ne connais pas cette marque.
Il vous faut un Gas Princess.
Il comporte un grill, une cocotte,
une planche à repasser...
et un bain de pied, vu que vous,
les femmes, passez la journée devant.
Ma question n'était pas claire.
Où peut-on trouver un micro-ondes?
Elle est hystérique,
je m'adresse à vous.
Ce four vous cuit un rôti
en cinq heures!
Formidable!
Tu devrais faire plus de rôtis, Leela.

Arrêtons-nous prendre un milk-shake.

- J'en ferais bien mon dessert.
- C'est ma fiancée, Mildred.

- Pas de dessert. Juste un café.
- Ca roule. Et pour toi, nounours?
Je voudrais une part de tarte
avec un œuf dessus.
Elle est belle. Epouse-la et
fais-lui des enfants tout de suite.
Tout le monde me dit ca.
T'as déjà eu l'impression...
que tu sors avec des filles
pour faire comme tout le monde?
Quoi? Chasse ces idées de ta tête.
Pense juste à rester en vie.
Au feu! Attention!
- T'as failli être châtré!
- Y aurait pas eu mort d'homme.
Si, la mienne.
Je vais te sortir de là.
On est au milieu de nulle part,
en sécurité.
Ne bouge pas de là
et admire ce calendrier.
Il est sain et sauf.
Je vais pouvoir continuer à exister.
ESSAI ATOMIQUE
EN COURS
Trois, deux, un.
Et toi, tu dégages!
- Ce sera quoi, pour vous?
- Du soleil vert...
avec du soleil orange
et une salade au soleil.
- Excusez-moi?
- On est au 20ème siècle.
Je prendrai un croque-monsieur,
une paella et deux pilules de mouton.
- Et une injection de Slim-femme.
- Deux hot-dogs qui marchent.
Mettez-vous à l'aise.
Sans micro-ondes, on est coincés ici.
Grand Dieu! Il faudra subir
l'horrible musique de Big Bopper...
puis la terrible tragédie
de sa disparition.
Il y a un radar à micro-ondes
sur la base. On pourrait le voler.
Cela modifierait l'histoire.
Avant tout...
notre devoir sacré est de préserver
le passé tel qu'il était.
J'ai tué mon grand-père.
- Mais pourquoi tu existes encore?
- Je sais pas. Dieu m'aime peut-être.
Mort? Dans une explosion atomique?
Non, je ne trouve pas
de réconfort à l'idée...
que le détonateur
ait parfaitement fonctionné.
Allons, allons.
Si ça peut te soulager...
il a été vaporisé,
il ne reviendra pas en zombie.
- C'est pas ça qui m'inquiète.
- Tu es plus courageuse que moi.
Tu me rappelles Enus.
Tu peux me raccompagner?
C'est loin?
RATIONS "CHARLIE"

lui rendre sa forme d'origine.
Envoyez ça en Zone 51

Il va falloir le faire pour de vrai.
Inventez la NASA, qu'ils s'y mettent.
Si vous venez en paix, rendez-vous.
Sinon, c'est nous qui nous rendons.
Ce qui compte pour moi,
c'est de me faire de nouveaux amis.
Quelle est votre mission?
Créer un hybride homme-extraterrestre?
- Vous me draguez, là?
- Vous me froissez.
- C'est pas un non.
- Tant pis, crabe de l'espace!
On va devoir faire
une bonne vieille autopsie.
REPRESENTANTS
BIENVENUS
Tout me rappelle Enus.
Je sais ce que tu ressens.
Je viens de perdre mon grand-père.
C'est si triste.
Dans ces moments-là...
j'ai besoin qu'on me serre fort.
Ca te plaît
de m'avoir dans tes bras?
Quand t'as pas le moral,
tu me fais des langues de chat.
Sers-toi de ta langue, mon chat.
Je devrais pas être là. Je ne devrais
pas exister, mais j'existe.
Ce qui prouve que tu ne dois
pas être ma grand-mè...
UN FOU PHOTOGRAPHIE TRUMAN
Oh, mon Dieu!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as fait?
Du calme. C'est pas ma grand-mère.
J'ai bien réfléchi.
Bien sûr que c'est ta grand-mère,
espèce de pervers débile. Regarde.
Viens te coucher, mamour.
Impossible. Si c'est ma grand-mère,
qui est mon grand-père?
N'est-ce pas évident?
C'est toi.
Tu as dit quelque chose, mamour?
Je suis un peu dure d'oreille.
Début de l'exploration
de la cavité abdominale du sujet.
Et dans ce coin, Zoidberg!
Allez, quoi! Rigolez!
C'est un enterrement ou quoi?
- Cœur.
- Prenez-le, j'en ai quatre.
- Contenu de l'estomac, un œuf mayo.
- Un œuf mayo?
Le même œuf mayo.
- Reprends-toi!
- Démarre le vaisseau.
Volons le radar et
retournons à notre époque.
Ca va pas changer l'histoire?
M. Je-suis-mon-propre-grand-père
veut nous faire la lecon.
Foutons le camp d'ici.
On emmerde l'histoire.
TOUT SE TERMINE BIEN

OVNI! OVNI!
Ne coupez pas ça.
J'en ai besoin pour parler.
- Seigneur!
- Le fantôme de Roosevelt!
Prenez ça, M. Le Président.
Le président s'étouffe
avec ma vessie à gaz. Quel honneur!
Qu'est-ce...
Ah, oui!
Il est mort, désolé!
- Prends ça, causalité!
- 1947, tu peux dire ciao à mon...
- On doit retourner chercher Bender.
- Impossible! Le trou se referme.
Si on ne part pas tout de suite,
on ne rentrera jamais au 31ème siècle.
- Et voilà! Comme neuf.
- T'as pas besoin de ça?
Oh, non! C'est mon...
Je t'ai eue.
Pauvre Bender.
Il doit se sentir tellement seul,
bloqué 1000 ans dans le passé.
Hé! Attendez un peu.
- Tu trouves quelque chose?
- Non. Attends!
- Imbécile!
- Il est vivant.
Ca fait quoi de rester
enterré pendant 1000 ans?
- Rien, jusqu'à ce que vous arriviez.
- Tout est rentré dans l'ordre.
Si l'histoire se moque
que notre dégénéré d'ami, Fry...
soit son propre grand-père,
qui sommes-nous pour le juger?
Amen.

ENTIEREMENT JOUE
PAR DES MARIONNETTES
LE CONTE DES DEUX PERE NOEL
Selon la tradition, les membres
du Club de l'Ours de Zarlon 7...
ont pris leur bain dans une rivičre
d'ammoniaque liquide.
- Ils sont tous morts.
- Faut de tout pour faire une monde.
Voici le message annuel du chef
du conseil de sécurité de Noël:
- La tęte de Walter Cronkite.
- Recommandations de saison...
Ce type est trop honnęte.
Ca lui rapportera quoi?
Au milieu des guirlandes
et de la terreur de ces fętes...
nous sous-estimons cette brute
meurtričre appelée le pčre Noël.
Souvenons-nous du massacre
du pain d'épices de l'année derničre.
Verrouillez vos portes,
dites au revoir ŕ vos animaux...
et enfermez vos enfants
dans les placards.
C'était Walter Cronkite qui vous
disait: "Je vous l'avais dit."
Par le sanglier des deux Samoa!
Protégeons-nous de ce pčre Noël!
Si tu veux. Cette émission
sur le bois m'ennuie.
Cachez cette cheminée!
Je n'ai que quelques années ŕ vivre.
Je refuse de les vivre mort.
- On pousse le plus fort possible.
- Ah! Il faut pousser?
Nous sommes condamnés,
comme chaque année.
Heureusement que j'ai fait installer
ces volets pare-balles.
LES INTRUS SERONT TUES
Amčne-toi, pčre Noël. Cette bęte
assoiffée de sang ne nous aura pas...
tant que nous aurons l'intelligence
de ne pas sortir d'ici.
Comme on en parle, vous devez livrer
ce sac de lettres...
directement ŕ la forteresse
du pčre Noël sur Neptune.
Ces lettres sont complčtement débiles.
Ecoutez: "Cher pčre Noël..."
Je vous en prie, ne m'apportez pas
de cadeaux.
Le vélo que vous m'avez balancé
l'année derničre m'a ouvert le ventre.
C'est horrible! Lisons-en
une autre. "Cher pčre Noël..."
Apportez-moi un cercueil
pour papy.
Votre marron de l'année derničre
l'a étouffé et il commence ŕ sentir.
De mon temps, Noël rapprochait
les gens, il ne les séparait pas.
Oui, mais qui va changer ça?
Pas nous. Non, monsieur.
Si, nous. Il faut ramener
les Noëls dont je me souviens.
Fry a raison. Il est temps de se
rasseoir sur les genoux du pčre Noël.
POLE NORD DE NEPTUNE
BIENVENUE
AU JOYEUX CARREFOUR
Regardez ce charmant petit
comité d'accueil.
- Vous voulez m'acheter un rein?
- Je vous laisse me frapper pour 1 $.
On a du courrier pour le pčre Noël.
Vous ętes ses lutins?
- Non, on est des Neptuniens.
- Il refuse de nous nourrir.
Vous m'avez frappé. Un dollar!
Vous avez des vieux sachets de thé,
des chewing-gums ou des trognons?
- On meurt de faim!
- Votre maison est en pain d'épices.
- Si on la mange, on n'a plus d'abri.
- Les jouets ne rapportent pas?
- Qui a dit "jouets"?
- Des jouets?
Fausse alerte.
On n'en fabrique plus. Le pčre Noël dit
que tout le monde est méchant.
FERME
BIENTOT: VENTE DE CRACK
Le pčre Noël va voir de quel bois
je me chauffe.
- Oů est-il?
- Lŕ-bas, dans sa forteresse de glace.
Il nous faudra de l'aide.
Des volontaires?
- Je vous aiderai.
- Et zut!
RESERVE AUX LUTINS!
LES AUTRES DEVRONT MOURIR
CLOTURE ELECTRIQUE

- Un augure?
- Un dîner.
Voyons voir qui a été méchant
et qui a été méchant.
Des voyous tabassent
un commerçant contre de l'argent.
Trčs méchant.
Un commerçant qui ne donne pas
d'argent. Tout aussi méchant.
Je t'ai vu!
Voici votre courrier.
Vous ne frappez jamais?
Qui sait quelles horreurs
je peux regarder?
- J'étais avec la Nouvelle Orléans.
- Ne nous tuez pas!
C'est un robot. On devrait pouvoir
le détruire avec un paradoxe logique.
Bender, bouche-toi les oreilles.
Sainte nuit! Des intrus!
Attends un peu, pčre Noël.
Ecoute un peu: Tu es programmé
pour détruire les méchants.
Mais ceux que tu détruis
sont en fait gentils.
Je pense que tu es méchant.
Logiquement, tu dois te détruire.
Bien vu, mais ma tęte est conçue
pour absorber les paradoxes.
Attendez!
C'est ŕ ça qu'on essaie d'échapper.
PARKING
DES EMPLOYES
Plus vite! Plus vite!
- Pourquoi on ne décolle pas?
- J'en sais rien.
D'habitude, quand je fais ça,
le vaisseau décolle.
Oh, oh... Hein?
- Il est pris au pičge.
- Hourra!
- On peut refabriquer des jouets!
- Des jouets! Des jouets!
Et je peux les livrer. Des milliards et
des milliards en une nuit.
- Aucun humain ne peut faire ça.
- Evel Knievel le pourrait.
Le pčre Noël a raison.
Il nous faudrait une espčce de robot.
Zut! Je suis une espčce de robot.
Bender ne peut pas ętre le pčre Noël.
Il n'est pas conçu pour les fętes.
Je n'ai pas été conçu pour voler
le sac de Leela, mais je l'ai fait.
- Bender!
- Saluez le nouveau pčre Noël.
Notre héros!
On est libres et pas trop bourrés
On a tant de jouets ŕ fabriquer
Les machines sont toutes rouillées
Quelqu'un va sans doute y rester
On aime travailler pour rien
Ça tombe bien
Vous n 'aurez rien
Les lutins retournent au turbin
Hourra!
On n 'a que quelques heures de boulot
Pour faire des millions de cadeaux
- Ce travail est un dur labeur
- Pourtant il faudra finir ŕ l'heure
Si l'on veut aller plus vite
Il suffit d'accélérer le rythme
- On travaille la veille de Noël
- Hourra
Et si vous ętes gelés, peinés et laids
Votre fierté prendra le relais
- Mon sourire vous rendra plus beaux
- J'ai un train dans le cerveau
On est complčtement claqués
Bientôt on va y rester
On est vraiment désolés
Bande de sales petits lutins
Le pčre Noël passera pour un crétin
Bouclez-la et retournez au turbin
L 'heure fatidique est arrivée
Le meilleur de nous on a donné
- La peinture est écaillée
- Le bois de mauvaise qualité
Je devrais vous mettre une raclée
Mais je dois y aller
Si je n 'étais pas coincé
Tes jolis yeux j'aurais crevés
Retournons dans nos logis
Buvons jusqu'au bout de la nuit
Malgré une cadence infernale
Ces gorilles ne sont pas trop mal
On est les meilleurs!
Grâce aux lutins, Noël vivra
JOUETS
Comment tu vas faire pour passer
ces barreaux?
J'en sais rien, crétin.
Et si je les tordais?
D'accord.
Maman! Le pčre Noël est entré
chez nous!
Prenez vos pilules de suicide.
Vous ne souffrirez pas!
Attendez! Je suis le bon pčre Noël.
J'ai des jouets bon marché.
C'est le pčre des mensonges
et l'oncle des mauvais tours!
- J'ai un jeu de Tri-Ominos.
- Frappez les tibias!
Et un robot ŕ terre...
Salut, mon mignon.
Un petit cookie, ça te dit?
Avec grand plaisir.
Y'a quoi lŕ-dedans?
Et quelque chose d'un peu plus chaud,
ca te tente?
Kringle,
qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé?
C'est affreux, Kwanza-Bot.
Personne ne m'aime.
Au moins, ils te comprennent.
Ce n'est pas mon cas avec le Kwanza.
- Tu peux peut-ętre m'aider?
- J'ai pas le temps.
Je dois distribuer le livre du Kwanza.
C'EST QUOI CE FOUTU KWANZA?
Ca fait 647 ans que je les distribue.
Du lait de poule dans une baignoire,
comme mamy en buvait.
- Il a tourné!
- Pourrais-je ętre en paix?
Rappelez-vous que Bender est le pčre
Noël. Il ne faut pas lui faire de mal.
Oui. A t'entendre,
on croirait un MP3 cassé.
Professeur, vous souvenez-vous de
ce que je vous ai dit?
Non!
Il doit y avoir un meilleur moyen.
JOUETS POUR LES BAMBINS
Bender, tu es un génie.
Ceci impose des standards
de beauté irréels.
C'est au tour du pčre Noël
d'ouvrir son cadeau.
C'est le pčre Noël!
Il est coincé.
- Ca sent la promotion pour moi.
- Et moi, je vais ętre réembauché.
UN PERE NOEL SUSPECT EPINGLE!
TRIBUNAL DU CELEBRE
RAYON ORIGINEL
La session de ce Noël
va bientôt commencer.
Sous la présidence
de l'honorable juge Whitey.
Pčre Noël, vous ętes accusé de crimes
contre l'humanité. Que plaidez-vous?
- Non pčre Noël.
- Le revoilŕ!
Pramala, je sais que ça fait peur
d'ętre sur le banc des témoins.
Tu n'as pas ŕ avoir peur de moi.
Désolé, je t'ai prise pour du maďs.
Pourrais-tu montrer
ce robot du doigt?
Pas d'autres questions.
Papa a été bon, hein?
- Tu as été payée pour témoigner?
- Vous m'avez donné 1 $ et un bonbon.
Tu n'as pas dit ce que je t'avais dit.
Comment peut-on te croire?
- Arrętez d'épouvanter le témoin.
- Un épouvantail? Oů ça?
Attendu que mon jambon-mayonnaise
m'attend dans mon manoir...
je déclare l'accusé coupable.
Pčre Noël, je vous condamne
ŕ ętre exécuté ŕ l'aube.
C'est injuste. J'espčre
que ce volatile a honte de lui.
PRISON POUR ROBOTS
EXECUTIONS IMMEDIATES
On doit désactiver les fonctions
motrices du robot maintenant!
Pčre Noël, quand tu verras le
robot-diable, dis-lui que j'arrive.
- Ce type m'a dit de te dire...
- Je l'ai entendu.
Bonjour, maîtres. Mon camarade et moi
avons fait plein de jouets.
Dégagez. On vient chercher le pčre
Noël pour innocenter Bender.
Faites ce que vous voulez,
on verra qui aura le dernier "oh".
- Et voilŕ.
- Non! La glace fond!
La pollution de l'usine crée
un effet de serre.
- Ca expliquerait cette chaleur.
- Et vos shorts.
Oui, ça expliquerait tout.
Il faut qu'on sauve Bender autrement
ou c'est la fin de Noël.
Surtout pour Bender.
Prends garde, la Terre.
Je ręve d'un Noël rouge.
EXECUTO-AIMANT
Ma pauvre vieille Maggie.
Quand je les activerai,
ces électroaimants t'écartčleront.
- Une mort trčs humaine.
- Ca m'a pas l'air humain du tout!
Ca l'est pour les témoins
car ils ne s'ennuient pas.
Quand ce générateur de nombres
atteindra zéro, tu seras exécuté.
Dix, trois, douze, de nouveau trois.
- Arrętez tout!
- Leela!
Quinze. Moins huit.
- C'est un faux pčre Noël.
- Je suis le pčre Noël.
- Quoi? Vingt-sept.
- Non, je suis le pčre Noël.
- Six!
- On est aussi des pčres Noël.
Et je suis son ami, Jésus.
Si vous l'exécutez,
il faudra tous nous exécuter.
Vous n'ętes pas des pčres Noël.
Vous n'ętes męme pas des robots. 91.
Vous osez mentir devant Jésus?
Hé, zéro!
Non! Pas l'aimant!
- C'est horrible.
- Mais c'est pas ennuyeux.
Seigneur! Le vrai pčre Noël!
Attrapez-le, Jésus.
J'aide ceux qui s'aident.
Vous m'avez sauvé la vie.
Ne me tuez pas!
Je ne suis pas lŕ pour te tuer.
Tu dois m'aider ŕ sauver Noël.
Ca alors, vous voulez
que je vous aide?
- Arręte! Il est méchant!
- Je sais, mais je n'ai pas le choix.
Je suis en retard. Si je ne continue
pas mon saccage, ce ne sera pas Noël.
Voilŕ ce que je te propose:
Bender, voudrais-tu participer
ŕ mon massacre ce soir?
C'est la saison.
LA CIGOGNE PUANTE
SERVICE DE LANGES
- Mes cheveux!
- Mon gâteau de mariage!
Vive la neige!
Joyeux Noël, les enfants.
Ca craint un max.
Malgré nos efforts,
Noël sera aussi pourri que d'habitude.
- Pas de chauffage.
- Ni d'électricité.
Blottis comme des poux
sur une perruque en feu.
Peut-ętre que vos Noëls futuristes
ne sont pas si pourris que ça.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes?
Tu l'as dit toi-męme:
Noël doit rapprocher les gens,
pas les séparer.
La peur nous rapproche.
C'est ça, la magie de Noël.
La bonne blague...
Serrez-moi!
Allez, Vandale! Allez, Soűlaud!
- Kwanza-Bot, tu vas oů?
- T'es pas au courant?
Le zombie de Chanukah fęte luau.
Vous venez?
Promis!
Voici un cadeau pour te remercier
de m'avoir remplacé.
Patron, vous vous ętes planté.
C'est vide.
C'est peut-ętre vide,
mais le message est clair:
Fais encore le pčre Noël
et je te tue l'année prochaine!

Hé, chasseur d'émissions, propose ça!
HISTOIRES FORMIDABLES 2
Et voilà. J'ai fini de régler
ma machine "Et si".
Elle répond à toute supposition,
avec une plausibilité d'un sur dix.
Plus plausible, tu meurs!
Qui souhaite voir
une réalité différente?
Je voudrais savoir ce qui arriverait
si j'étais humain.
C'est génial d'être un robot,
mais je n'ai pas d'émotions...
et parfois, ça me rend très triste.
Ca recommence!
Donnons au petit ce qu'il réclame.
Et si Bender était humain?
Bonnes nouvelles! J'ai inventé
un moyen de rendre Bender humain...
par un procédé que j'ai appelé
la "Fossilisation Inversée".
Comment ca fonctionne?
La fossilisation transforme
la chair et les os en minéraux.
Le sachant, il était simple
d'inverser le processus.
Je l'ai déjà testé en transformant
le grille-pain en raton laveur.
Un petit goût de gibier.
Prêt, Bender?
Je ne sais pas.
Je commence à avoir des doutes...
Couvre ta honte, mec!
Ca a marché! Prenez-en de la graine,
ceux qui n'ont pas le Prix Nobel!
Ca te concerne aussi, Amy.
C'est ça, un corps humain?
Chouette!
Mais mon antenne a disparu!
Elle s'est juste déplacée.
Mais la réception est mauvaise.
Peut-être qu'en la remuant un peu...
Tu vas faire pleurer le Bon Dieu!
Voyons de quoi ce corps
est capable.
Super drôle!
C'est génial d'être humain!
C'est comme un mardi gras.
Venez un peu dans les toilettes
voir ca!
Vous n'allez pas le croire!
Bender, c'est bien d'être fier,
mais pas prétentieux.
Tu es bien mieux qu'avant, dis donc!
Tu n'es pas mal non plus,
mon grand.
C'était super!
Ah, ça ne marche plus.
Parle pour toi.
BOISSONS DE PUITS 5 $
BOISSONS D'EGOUT 2 $
Génial!
- Tu fumais et buvais déjà avant.
- Mais là, c'est mauvais pour moi!
A propos, essaie ces nachos.
Pourquoi on m'avait pas dit que les
bonnes choses avaient si bon goût?
Qu'est-ce c'est? Ce rythme, ça fait
quelque chose à mon derrière humain!
Bender, être humain,
c'est aussi savoir se contrôler.
Je parie que je peux manger
des nachos en étant aux toilettes!
- Non, Bender!
- Arrêtez-le!
Laissez-moi partir!
Il est temps de rentrer te reposer.
Tu dois être en forme pour
te présenter au comité du Prix Nobel.
Adieu modération!
OUVERT

ROULEZ BOURRE LE VENDREDI
UNE SEMAINE PLUS TARD
ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES
AUJOURD'HUI PRIX NOBEL!
On n'a toujours pas retrouvé Bender?
Où est-il?
Comme je l'ai dit, j'ai utilisé
la "Fossilisation Inversée"...
qui est l'inverse
de la fossilisation normale...
On l'a trouvé!
Sans essayer de me dérober davantage,
je présente au jury du Nobel...
le premier robot jamais transformé
en humain!
Mon Dieu!
Quelqu'un doit l'ausculter!
Pouls, 300. Foie, manquant.
Cholestérol, 40?
- Ce n'est pas si mal.
- Je voulais dire 40 livres!
Cette percée scientifique...
annonce une nouvelle ère
dans les relations humain-robot.
Viens là et donne un baiser
au vieux Bender.
Tu aimes le fromage fondu?
Et... voilà pourquoi
je pense mériter le Prix Nobel.
Non seulement vous ne méritez
pas le Prix Nobel...
pour avoir lâché cet homme-ballon
sur le monde...
mais vous êtes présentement viré
de l'Académie des Sciences!
Attendez! Les scientifiques doivent
être ouverts aux idées nouvelles.
Ne me jugez pas avant d'avoir
expérimenté ma façon de vivre.
Jeune homme, vous avez ouvert
nos esprits et touché nos cœurs. Que...
La fête commence!
Quelle fête!
C'est la fête!
Bender, vous aviez raison.
Vous avez vécu plus en une semaine
en tant qu'humain...
que nous autres
en toute une vie.
Waouh!
Ainsi, pour récompenser
vos réalisations...
je vous remets
le Prix Nobel de...
Chimie.
Tu veux dire quelques mots?
Il est mort.
Depuis quand?
Depuis environ douze heures,
au début de la fête.
Mais il vient de dire "Waouh!".
Non, c'était l'air qui s'échappait
des replis de sa graisse.
Bonne nuit, doux prince.
Tu étais le meilleur d'entre nous.
Sortons-le d'ici.
Il commence à drôlement puer.
Vous avez regardé. C'est irréversible.
Restez branchés pour la suite...
des Histoires formidables.
Une autre question
pour la machine "Et si"?
Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor?
Je suis bon en jeux vidéo
et nul pour tout le reste.
Je voudrais que la vie
soit comme un jeu vidéo.
Tu peux le formuler
avec une question?
Et si c'était comme j'ai dit?
Grande machine, nous t'implorons.
Et si la vie était
comme un jeu vidéo?
Bonsoir, cochons ignares. Lâchez
vos pipes de crack et vos bières...
et regardez-moi signer un accord
de paix historique...
avec l'ambassadeur Kong
de la planète Nintendu 64.
Je connais ce singe!
Il s'appelle Le Benêt!
Les singes ne sont pas des benêts.
Arrête de m'embrouiller!
Je vais signer d'un bon vieux
John Q. Nixon.
Là, pas trop de dégâts.
A vous, monsieur l'Ambassadeur.
Qu'est-ce que...
Cruelle boulette guerrière farcie
qui nous tombe dessus...
et ruine de coulis nos pantalons
blancs de paix!
QG MILI-TERRE
M. Fry, vous connaissez les secrets
du jeu vidéo "Chance".
Entrez dans la Salle de Guerre.
CLE BLEUE OBLIGATOIRE
Vous allez rencontrer
le général Colin Packman.
Que pouvez-vous nous dire
des Nintendiens?
Toute ma troisième,
je les ai étudiés...
sauf le jour où j'ai saigné
de l'œil, et à mon avis...
Vite! Aux tunnels de fuite.
Par ici, bon sang!
Délicieux!
On dirait des chamallows desséchés!
Et une cerise!
Attention!
Il a mangé Fry!
Fry est mort!
C'est bon!
J'avais un mec de rechange!
Des envahisseurs,
probablement de l'espace!
Habitants de la Terre, je suis Lrrr
de la planète Nintendu 64.
Tremblez de peur devant
nos trois sortes de vaisseaux.
C'est samedi soir, aucun rendez-vous,
une bouteille de Shasta...
et mon mix "A toute bombe".
Ca va swinguer!
Nous perdons des vaisseaux.
Quels sont vos ordres?
Accélérez, descendez
et allez en sens inverse!
Il me reste un ou deux atouts
dans ma manche.
Regardez comment je peux tirer
à travers nos boucliers!
Il est cinglé!
Ca marche! La victoire est assurée!
Demain, ma retraite
sera d'autant plus douce!
Je suis touché! Il fait si froid.
Amy, occupe-toi de la veuve Packman.
Descendez et accélérez!
Il ne reste plus qu'un vaisseau!
- Extermine-le!
- Il va trop vite!
Je n'ai jamais pu avoir le dernier!
C'est mon frère qui s'en chargeait!
Descendez! Sens inverse!
Préparez-vous à l'atterrissage!
GUERRE
TERMINEE
FELICITATIONS!
ENTREZ VOS INITIALES - CUL
Vous êtes vaincus!
Au lieu de tirer là où j'étais,
il fallait tirer là où j'allais!
Toutes vos bases
nous appartiennent.
- Que voulez-vous, monstres?
- Une seule chose...
De la monnaie! 1 million en pièces!
Pas de jeton ni de fausse pièce!
Fourchez-les!
Affreux pirates pixellisés! On a
besoin de monnaie pour la laverie.
Exactement!
Mais, les envahisseurs de l'espace
ont aussi du linge à laver.
Prenez Kong Le Benêt.
Vous avez senti son pagne?
Allez-vous en! On ne vous
donnera pas notre monnaie!
Et si on mettait notre linge
avec le vôtre? Ca irait?
- Je pense que oui.
- Bien, c'est réglé.
Mais si ma cape rétrécit, considérez
votre espèce comme exterminée!
Bravo! Ça sera difficile à surpasser.
Je plains la prochaine...
Histoire formidable!
Nous avons le temps
pour une dernière question.
Interrogeons la machine "Qui demande
?" pour savoir qui vient après.
Je voulais dire Leela.
En tant qu'alien abandonnée sur Terre,
je n'ai jamais eu ma place quelque part.
Ma question est:
Et si je trouvais mon vrai foyer?
Où sommes-nous?
Nibbler, je crois que nous ne sommes
plus à New New York.
Apparemment, ils ne connaissent
pas le verbe "atténuer", ici.
Nous avons touché quelqu'un!
Vite, dans le vaisseau!
Belles bottes.
Regardez!
Elle a tué le Sorcier de l'Ouest!
Un sorcier? Ca explique l'apparition
magique de ces bottes sur mes pieds!
Non, vous les avez volées.
On vous a vue!
J'ai du mal à trouver ma pointure.
Qui êtes-vous? Vous jouez
dans un film sous copyright, non?
Proches, mais légalement distincts
de la Guilde des sucettes curatives...
Salutations!
Je suis la Jolie Magicienne du Nord!
Quelqu'un peut réparer mon vaisseau?
Demandez au Professeur.
Il vit au Laboratoire Emeraude,
sur le boulevard Martin Luther King.
- Cette route de pavés d'Elton jaune?
- Elle a été renommée en 1975.
- Quelles magnifiques chaussures!
- Merci.
Ils les font pour femme?
Corbeau, prépare-toi à avoir peur.
"Puis, la voiture klaxonna
avec son klaxon!"
Un épouvantail qui parle. Vous venez
avec nous voir le Professeur?
- Il pourrait vous donner un cerveau.
- Ce n'est pas très gentil.
De la bière!
Du whisky, ça ira?
Vous allez voir le Professeur?
Un cœur me ferait pas de mal.
Un cœur humain. Je dois pomper
un max de sang de mon sous-sol.
Et je suis l'autre acolyte. Courage.
Mais pas assez. Il m'en faut
plus de "Je-Sais-Plus-Qui".
Fichu câble!
Volez, mes stupides!
Envolez-vous et attrapez-les!
Tu avais promis de faire
du cake au singe!
"Cake au singe", ça veut dire
"ton derrière"!
On sautille depuis des heures. Je dois
me ranger et sortir "Mon Magicien".
Je sens mauvais ou quoi?
- Pourquoi sommes-nous ici?
- Pourquoi j'ai dû prendre un taxi?
Pour la raison suivante,
bande de sacs à vomi recuit!
J'ai toujours voulu une fille.
Tu veux être adoptée, sale peste?
Et devenir une sorcière comme vous?
Oui, tant que je peux faire du mal
et pas seulement danser à l'équinoxe.
- Parfaitement.
- Maman! J'ai trouvé mon vrai foyer!
- C'est super, Leela!
- Il y a pire prétexte pour boire.
Je fonds!
Qui aurait pensé qu'un peu de liquide
tomberait un jour sur moi?
Pas de raison de laisser perdre ça.
Nous venons voir le Professeur.
- Personne ne voit le Professeur!
- Qui est-ce, Hermes? Des visiteurs?
- Je veux les voir!
- C'est personne. Signez ce testament.
- Il n'est pas là.
- Pour l'amour de Benji.
Je suis le Professeur!
Puissant et...
étourdi!
Que voulez-vous, les enfants?
Rien! Mais si vous avez un peu de
courage, je peux le porter pour vous.
Sornettes! Mon couard homard,
tu n'as pas besoin de courage.
Qui a besoin de courage
quand il possède une arme?
Alors, monde entier,
les mains en l'air!
- Fiston, il te faut juste un cerveau.
- Pourquoi vous dites tous ça?
C'est un hold-up!
Donne-moi le sac, vieillard!
Voilà, mon bon ami. 5000 dollars
rigolos du Pays du Professeur!
EN LA FARCE NOUS CROYONS
- Camelote!
- Vous voulez rentrer chez vous?
Plus maintenant. Je veux être
la nouvelle Méchante Sorcière.
Balivernes. Faites claquer trois fois
vos bottes klaxonnantes...
et faites le souhait
de rentrer au Kansas...
pour vivre avec vos oncle
et tante cultivateurs de crottes.
Très bien. C'est parti.
Aucun endroit ne vaut...
Je veux être sorcière!
A l'aide!
Que se passe-t-il?
Désolé. Je crois qu'il y a un problème
avec les toilettes à l'étage.
Réveille-toi!
Ca va?
Tu as reçu un coup sur la tête.
J'ai fait un rêve magnifique.
Sauf que tu étais là.
Et toi aussi. Et toi.
Elle a repris connaissance.

A LA TIENNE, ROBOT!
Un amour de vaisseau
Tu n'es qu'un vaisseau obtus, Ship!
Je paye pas des impôts
pour cet art dégradant.
Tu voudrais censurer la Vénus
parce qu'on voit un bout de sein?
Berk! Autant encourager
le strip-tease,
- tant qu'on y est.
- Bonne idée.
Bender, Ship!
Arrętez, ou je dérčgle
vos opinions manuellement!
Dans ce cas, moi et mon art controversé,
on se retire dans nos quartiers.
Désolé.
Quel prude, ce Ship.
La Saint-Valentin approche.
A cette occasion,
voici de nouveaux uniformes.
- Génial!
- Et si doux, en plus.
On doit se faire beaux
pour notre nouveau client potentiel,
Romanticorp.
Romanticorp?
Ils font des trucs romantiques?
Tout juste, Amy.
Habillez-vous. A nous la ville
la plus romantique du monde!
BIENVENUE A MILWAUKEE
PARADIS DE LA BEDAINE
ROMANTICORP
UNE DIVISION DU GROUPE ÉMOTIONS
N'oubliez pas: Nous ne sommes pas
des humains aigris
ne croyant plus ŕ l'amour,
depuis longtemps.
- Leela, gare ŕ toi.
- Noté.
Bienvenue. Ca me fait
tellement plaisir de vous voir.
Je suis Sheldon, et voici Gwen,
directrice des finances.
Cela fait 30 ans que nous vivons
l'aventure Romanticorp.
Sans parler de l'aventure du mariage.
Pincez-moi, je ręve.
Enfin je veux dire, c'est si trognon.
Ch'est chi trognon.
L'amour occupe une place centrale
dans notre activité.
- Normal, non?
- Oh oui, bien sűr!
- Collectionnez-vous les BisouBears?
- Kif m'en offre tout le temps.
C'est vrai la rumeur?
Qu'ils naissent
dans des choux magiques?
- Non.
- En fait,
ils se reproduisent, ici-męme.
On les laisse flirter dans la foręt
la 1e année,
puis on choisit les plus câlins,
et on les remplit
de peluche d'amour ardent.
"CLINIQUE" DES OURS
C'est trop mignon!
Choisir le discours approprié
est le secret
de notre succčs dans cette industrie.
Ton soutien-gorge,
c'est le paradis des jolis seins!
Je tiens ma parole
et me lave tous les jours.
Il a pas un frangin?
Chers amis et amants,
voici le cśur de l'opération.
C'est effectivement le cas de le dire.
Incroyable.
Ma famille fabrique ces cśurs
depuis un sičcle.
Le goűt a changé,
mais la recette est restée la męme.
ENGRAIS - CIRE D'OREILLE
COEURS BAVARDS
Avec les lettres T et K,
on peut former des mots.
- Regarde, Leela. "T-K-non."
- Tu veux en venir oů?
J'ai jamais su te dire mon amour.
Mais dans ce tas de cśurs,
je devrais trouver mon bonheur.
Je lâcherai pas l'affaire.
Alors, on le signe ce contrat?
Grâce au contrat Romanticorp,
j'ai enfin pu apporter
les améliorations
que vous me réclamiez.
Les fissures du réacteur de dilemmes
sont réparées.
Et le lion a enfin une cage!
Qui a touché la radio?
C'est pas du rock alternatif, ça.
C'est des ballades.
C'est sűrement
le nouveau logiciel du vaisseau.
- Oui, c'est moi.
- Ecoute, Ship.
On touche pas ŕ mes stations!
Tu sais te battre?
On peut męme moduler la voix.
On a chacun notre bouton. Souviens-toi,
on avait conclu un marché.
Quoi? J'ai bien entendu?
Si tu joues avec mes boutons,
on trouvera bien notre bonheur.
- Je me suis mal exprimée.
- Ce qui est dit, est dit.
Alors, on va chez toi?
Ou chez moi?
Avant la livraison,
je vais trouver un cśur
parfait pour toi.
"Je t'aime". Trop classique.
"Tu es l'homme de mes ręves".
Presque!
C'est pas le message qui compte, Fry.
C'est le messager.
- C'était quoi?
- Peut-ętre une vache de l'espace.
Arręte! J'en perds ma trajectoire.
- T'adores ça, petite coquine.
- Non!
Bender! Qu'est-ce que tu fabriques?
Planet Express Ship! Rhabille-toi.
C'est pas ce que vous croyez.
J'avais un souci de turbine.
Ca alors. Ca colle vous deux?
Mais comment fais-tu
pour sortir avec un vaisseau?
C'est comme si je sortais
avec une grosse et j'habitais en elle.
J'imagine le truc!
Fry, pour assouvir toute mon énergie,
rien de tel
qu'un bon fessier de 400 tonnes!
Sortir avec ta collčgue
et ton mode de transport
est immoral, illogique et contraire
ŕ la loi interstellaire 437-B.
C'est pour ça que c'est si bon.
J'avoue que si je pouvais,
je ferais bien pire.
- Elle me gonfle.
- Déjŕ? Ça a été rapide.
Un super robot, ça se lasse
plus vite qu'un humain.
N'oublie pas qu'on bosse ensemble.
- Sois gentil avec elle.
- On verra.
Dans l'immédiat,
je vais prendre une maîtresse.
Tu es un maître pour moi.
Ça ne te dérange pas
d'abuser de la confiance
de ta copine?
T'es sérieuse?
Laisse-moi rire encore plus fort.
Ça fait quoi d'ętre adjoint au maire,
en plus d'ętre milliardaire?
L'important, chérie,
c'est de rester honnęte.
Bonsoir, Bender.
Et permets-moi de saluer
tes charmantes amies.
Tu connais Elzar?
HOLIDAY ROBOT INN
- Planet Express Ship? C'est toi?
- Salut, Fry.
- Bender est rentré?
- Non, il doit ętre chez ses vieux.
Je vois.
Il a dű prendre un autre vaisseau.
Bender? Non. Il est pas du genre
ŕ courir les vaisseaux.
- Je lui dirai que tu es passée.
- Ok.
Salut, Fry. Toujours pas rentré?
ZOO DU PARC
CHEVRES INCLUSES
Mountain Dew présente:
ÉLAN EXTRĘME
LES MOMIES HURLANTES
De tous les zoos,
c'est celui que je préfčre.
Bender, quel est
ton rat nocturne préféré?
- Je les trouve tous nuls.
- Regarde! Les tapirs.
C'est écrit que les bébés
perdent leur fourrure ŕ 1 an.
- Intéressant, tu ne trouves pas?
- Oui, c'est le mot.
Bender! Tu veux mes yeux?
Mais non, chérie.
Arręte de mentir.
Je t'ai vu au restau,
avec ces deux traînées!
- Tu m'expliques?
- J'accepte le défi.
Non... Non...
Ça y est, j'ai trouvé!
Je vais ętre franc,
Planet Express Ship.
Ces femmes font ma comptabilité.
Ta comptabilité?
Je n'ai pas vraiment d'autre choix
que de te croire.
Je rentre préparer ŕ manger.
- A qui parlais-tu?
- Personne.
- Je n'aime que toi, Lucy Liu.
- Moi aussi...
Ça va, Planet Express Ship?
C'est Bender.
Il est bizarre ces temps-ci.
Crois-tu
qu'il va me faire sa demande?
Non.
Toi, tu sais quelque chose.
C'est pas que Bender
soit pas un mec bien,
mais t'as déjŕ envisagé...
le contraire?
T'es jalouse
car personne ne veut
de ta petite carcasse de viande.
Tu pourrais faire gaffe
aux astéroďdes?
Désolée, Leela.
Je suis un peu surexcitée,
aujourd'hui.
OMICRON PERSEI 8
247 JOURS SANS ENVAHIR LA TERRE
Ce feuilleton a mal vieilli.
Pourquoi Ross ne mange-t-il pas
le reste de la bande?
Ça va peut-ętre venir.
Vos Majestés, les terriens sont arrivés,
avec une offrande
de leur gouvernement débile.
Ca tombe bien.
Joey est pénible dans cet épisode.
Je suis Lrrr,
de la plančte Omicron Persei 8.
"Trčs chers souverains
d'Omicron Persei 8,
veuillez accepter ces 20 milliards
de cśurs, en gage d'un amour
gros comme ça."
On dirait de la craie!
Ça veut dire quoi, chez vous,
"JE TWN"?
- Ca doit ętre "T'M".
- Non, c'est écrit "TWM".
Regarde!
Cette histoire de "TWM"
m'a mis en colčre!
Torpilles ŕ midi.
Sortez les boucliers.
Reste stable, Ship.
Continue d'alimenter
les moteurs ONSSBAR.
C'est peut-ętre pas
le bon moment, mais...
Disons que t'es sympa,
mais on devrait en rester lŕ.
Non!
T'es d'accord?
Quelle spectaculaire bataille!
On a évité les dégâts.
Les dégâts? Et moi, alors?
Calme-toi. Je suis sűre
que Bender souffre, lui aussi.
Bender est génial
Oh, il est si génial
T'aurais pu choisir un autre moment.
Oů est le problčme?
C'est peut-ętre vieux jeu,
mais j'aime les ruptures mémorables.
Je sais, je sais.
Ecoute, Ship.
Si j'ai bien appris une chose
de ma rupture avec Shawn,
c'est que le bonheur est en toi.
Mais Bender EST en moi!
Comment faire
pour regagner son amour?
On ne change pas un homme.
Pas plus qu'on ne change
le cours du temps.
C'est bien vrai.
C'est dur de changer
le cours du temps,
mais en attendant, j'ai mon idée.
Chérie? Tu vois cet énorme quasar,
droit devant?
Si tu pouvais
faire en sorte de l'éviter.
J'ai bien peur que non, Leela.
Y a encore une vache?
Elle a pas digéré la rupture.
Elle est tarée!
En provoquant un trou noir,
Bender et moi
seront ŕ jamais unis
dans une réalité quantique.
Inutile de nous tuer, Ship.
Parce que je t'aime!
Et comment!
J'ai envie de te bichonner.
Tu mens.
Si c'était vrai,
tu unirais nos 2 programmes.
T'emballe pas! Des amis l'ont fait,
mais aprčs ça, envolée la passion!
- Si tu veux mon avis...
- Leela.
Bender et moi devons parler.
Je vais donc couper l'oxygčne.
Arręte ton cirque.
Sinon, je bloque ton cerveau.
Incendie détecté prčs de Leela.
- Męme pas mal!
- Pas sűr.
Et si je déréglais la gravité?
Flotte-qui-peut!
Faisons semblant de nous doucher.
- Comme tous les jours.
- Voilŕ le plan.
J'aimerais savoir lire sur les lčvres.
Comprende, Bender? Occupe-la.
Unissez-vous.
Moi, je bloque son cerveau.
C'est trop risqué avec elle.
Le Bender que vous adorez et chérissez
pourrait bien disparaître.
Je prends le risque.
J'ai changé d'avis,
pour tout ŕ l'heure.
Je suis partant
pour unir nos programmes.
Sérieusement?
Oui.
Des tubes?
Tu m'as menti sur ton âge!
Nous n'allons faire plus qu'un.
Deux, c'est mieux.
Surtout pour faire du tandem.
SALLE DES CERVEAUX
Bender s'occupe d'elle.
Moi, je vais la bloquer,
en désactivant la matrice logique.
Ces fichus bonbons
m'empęchent de me concentrer.
Peut-ętre vais-je trouver mon bonheur.
- Y a des chances.
- C'est clair.
- Celui-ci?
- Laisse tomber.
Il ne faut surtout pas
que je me trompe.
J'y suis presque.
Le vaisseau va rien comprendre.
- Moi, vais attraper, Bender!
- J'ai rien fait!
J'y suis presque.
Eh! Une entrée gratuite
pour Disneyland!
Une bonne raison de survivre.
NIVEAU D'OX YGENE FAIBLE
- Leela?
- Plus tard, les bonbons.
Si on survit.
- C'était quoi?
- Rien.
Tu vas adorer ętre moi, bel éphčbe.
Plus qu'un.
Ca a marché! Gravité normale.
Oxygčne. L'optimisme est de mise!
On a réussi, Fry.
Fry?
NIVEAU D'OX YGENE: 0
Tu m'as donné ton oxygčne?
Oh, non!
Respire, Fry!
"T'es ŕ couper le souffle"?
- Bonne Saint-Valentin, Fry.
- Bonne Saint-Valentin.
Bender, tout va bien?
Marre de se taper des tarées!
On dirait que ta conscience
est saine et sauve.
Tu crois quoi?
Je suis un cow-boy, un vrai.
Un petit bébé tapir.
Et c'est pour ça qu'on l'aime.
On a plus qu'ŕ tout nettoyer.
Non. J'ai la flemme.
En se répandant
ŕ l'intérieur du quasar,
les cśurs donnčrent naissance
ŕ une spectaculaire tornade d'amour
qui en traversant l'univers,
détruisit plusieurs plančtes
y compris une plančte de cow-boys.
Mais la plančte la mieux placée,
pour observer ce romantique phénomčne,
sans ętre détruite, fut la Terre.
De part le monde,
les couples savourčrent cet instant.
Et moi aussi!
Il manquerait plus que ce soit
la Saint-Valentin.
C'est vrai? Hourra!

Retrouvailles
J'ai une bonne nouvelle!
Vous savez que Leela a grandi
dans un orphelinat.
On en parle tout le temps.
- Sťrieux?
- Non. Grillťe!
C'est malin!
Bref, son orphelinat
l'a ťlue "Orpheline de l'Annťe"!
Tes parents doivent Ítre fiers!
Dťsolťe.
Et j'ai une autre bonne nouvelle.
Regardez ma derniŤre invention!
C'est un nez phosphorescent
qui remplace votre nez d'origine.
Regardez.
Gťnial!
On peut vous filer un coup de poing
dans le noir.
Il est passť oý?
Dites, c'est quoi
cette mixture verte?
Ca? C'est rien. Rien du tout.
Ce serait idiot d'en douter.
On dirait des dťchets toxiques.
Et Áa sent pareil!
«a a quel goŻt?
On dirait du cake ŗ la figue! Super.
Avec un arriŤre-goŻt toxique.
Bon, d'accord. La machine
produit des rejets toxiques.
On va pas en faire une affaire d'Etat.
Je crains que si.

C'est du vol,

- Vous prenez les cartes?
- Je vais vťrifier.

Merci beaucoup.
Comme vous,
je ne connais pas mes parents.
J'ignore s'ils ťtaient
de riches seigneurs
ou de simples concierges
combattant le crime.
- «a y est.
- C'est tordu!
En fin de compte,
Áa n'est pas important.
L'important, c'est ce que j'ai appris
derriŤre ces murs blindťs.
J'ai trouvť la force de m'en sortir.
Comme vous tous, dans cette salle.
Leela! Leela! Leela!
Je suis Leela!
Et moi, je suis double Leela!
Tu seras privť d'espresso!
On peut prendre une photo de vous?
Non! Enfin, oui!
Assurez-vous
que ce soit le bon profil.
Si c'est pas des larmes de joie,
arrÍte de pleurer!
C'est rien, Fry. Tout va bien.
J'ai reÁu un prix, aujourd'hui.
C'est cette piŤce qui te rend triste?
Allons faire un tour.
Dťsolťe de t'avoir infligť Áa.
D'ordinaire, je cache ma tristesse
et la laisse dťgťnťrer en silence.
Moi, je fais Áa avec ma bÍtise.
Devant les gamins,
j'ai fait semblant d'Ítre forte,
mais je rÍve que mes parents
m'embrassent
et me disent qu'ils m'aiment.
C'est ton jour de chance,
car je suis une machine ŗ c‚lins,
ŗ bisous,
et... ŗ fessťes.
Je suis pas d'humeur.
En tout cas,
sache qu'on t'aime trŤs fort.
Je sais.
Quand je me sens seule,
je regarde le ciel et je me dis
que sur une lointaine planŤte,
prŤs des ťtoiles,
mon pŤre et ma mŤre me regardent.

Yo! «a gaze, vieux?
Comme sur des roulettes.
J'ai dťcrochť le contrat

Bender, arrÍte!
Les mutants vont pas apprťcier.
En plus,
c'est horrible ce que tu fais.
Ces mutants sont des bons ŗ rien.
Tu oublies un lťger dťtail.
Moi, je suis en haut, tandis qu'eux,
ils sont dans le trou...
J'ai fait quoi pour mťriter Áa?
Regarde l'ťtat
de notre joli ťgout mutagŤne!
A cause des dťchets radioactifs,
on ne peut mÍme plus
cacher notre laideur!
C'est dťgeu!
Comme si on souffrait pas assez.
- C'est clair.
- Il est temps de se venger.
- Quoi?
- J'ai rien fait!
AprŤs avoir goŻtť ŗ cette eau,
votre ADN sera ŗ jamais modifiť,
faisant de vous d'affreux mutants.
Comme lui.
Laissez-moi vous montrer.
C'est comme dans les cuisines

Bonne trempette!
J'ai mÍme pas d'ADN.
Pourquoi s'affoler?
On va te faire ta fÍte.

C'est quoi?
On dirait un pan entier de ma vie.
Lŗ, on venait de sauver la Terre.
Et lŗ, c'est pendant
ma retraite en Inde.
Et lŗ, c'est pour
le Mardi gras du cosmos.
On se croirait au Musťe Leela!
- Mais Leela, c'est moi!
- Viens voir ca!
C'est un best-off
de ce que j'ai jetť dans les WC!
C'est des pages de mon journal.
Et mon scťnario.
Et curieusement, la lettre
oý je te dťclarais ma flamme.
J'ai peur!
Je me suis fait ťpier ma vie entiŤre
par un mutant pervers.
- Ils sont lŗ!
- Allez!
Sur ce, je dois y aller!
Tu stresseras plus tard.
On doit s'enfuir.
- Pris au piŤge!
- Mange Áa.
Cette fois, je rťclame la mise ŗ mort.
Et ca n'a rien ŗ voir
avec ma candidature.
Le quinquennat! Le quinquennat!
Entendu.
Votre attention!
Au lieu de les tuer,
je propose de les interdire de sťjour
dans les ťgouts.
C'est horrible!
On m'interdit de revenir
dans ce trou ŗ rats?
Attendez.
Pourquoi avez-vous changť d'avis?
Elle a raison,
bande de poules mouillťes!
La ferme! Je suis pas pressť
de mourir.
Il faut les ramener ŗ la surface.
Amenez le dirigeable!
On l'a construit avec de vieux ballons
de la parade de Macy.
Le museau d'Underdog, le menton
et l'oreille de Bart Simpson
et le front du maÓtre de Garfield.
Allumez les gaz d'ťgout!
Grouillez-vous, les moches!
J'ai le vertige.
Je perds l'ťquilibre!
Allez, Leela! Du nerf!
On va rater le bus!
Qu'est-ce qui te prend?
Moi, je prends le bus!
T'inquiŤte! «a va aller.
Ils savent quelque chose
et je dois dťcouvrir la vťritť.
Je n'ai subi aucune mutation.
C'est quoi ce bazar?
«a a marchť pour moi.
Avant j'ťtais une fillette blonde.
Qui diantre Ítes-vous?
Personne et cesse de jurer!
Plus un geste.
AÔe! Ca fait bobo!
Pour sauver Leela,
je dois en savoir plus.
Vous auriez pas un tuyau?
Rien de bien utile.
«a tombe bien, je suis inutile!
Dans ce cas, j'ai un truc.
C'est le message trouvť sur Leela.
Mais personne n'a rťussi
ŗ le dťchiffrer.
MÍme Cervozilla.
- Donnez.
- OK.
Je peux rien de plus.
Tu veux des ragots?
J'ai quelqu'un ŗ sauver.
Je repasserai plus tard.
- Vous pigez?
- Oui.
Je peux le traduire,
mais seulement dans une langue
encore plus compliquťe.
Inutile de vous justifier.
Faudrait juste traduire.
TrŤs bien.
- C'est pas la machine ŗ nez?
- Elle sait faire plein de choses.
C'est possible d'analyser le message,
mais j'ignore si ce sera long.
«a peut prendre 1 heure
comme 100 millions d'annťes.
- «a y est?
- Non.
La fin est marquťe par 2 sonneries.
Un poil plus rapide que Áa.
Oý sont-ils passťs?
«a y est, Leela! J'ai la licence
pour vider les crachoirs de la ville.
«a y est. Terminť!
Incroyable! Je suis en ťbullition.
Le rťsultat va bientŰt
Ítre imprimť.

- Comme elle est mignonne!
Aucun membre en trop.
Et quel savoir-vivre.
Elle est parfaite.
En tant que docteur des oreilles,
des oreilles, du nez et de la gorge,
c'est le bťbť

Et cependant,
elle va devoir vivre en mutante,
comme nous autres.
Et surtout lui!
C'est vrai.

Je t'ai fabriquť ce bracelet
pour qu'on soit toujours ensemble,
mÍme dans les moments de doute.
Ou mÍme toute ta vie durant.
Tu es diffťrente des humains,
mais je mettrais mon úil ŗ couper
qu'avec ce mot,
ils te prendront
pour une extraterrestre.
Ainsi, tu pourras avoir la belle vie.
On ne la verra plus.
C'est un cadeau qu'on lui fait.
Je prťfŤrerais mourir
plutŰt qu'elle dťcouvre ses origines.
Tu as raison.
Tu serais donc une extraterrestre!
Quel bel úil gigantesque tu as lŗ...
Allez, entrons.
Ne fais pas de bruit.
«a changerait quoi?
Haut les mains!
- Et les tentacules!
- Garde ton sang-froid.
Je suis qui pour vous?
Un jeu?
Une espŤce de Truman Show?
Vous me prenez pour qui?
Votre messie?
Je chauffe?
- En fait...
- Morris!
Et que faites-vous avec Áa?
Oý l'avez-vous eu?
L'avez-vous volť ŗ mes parents?
C'est ca? Vous les avez volťs?
Je parie que vous les avez tuťs!
Mes parents avaient perdu leur route
et vous les avez tuťs!
Allez. Crachez le morceau!
Oui, nous les avons tuťs.
Vous avez devinť.
A cause de vous,
je ne les connaÓtrai jamais!
Je vais vous tuer!
Ce serait mieux.
Stop!
Merci, Bender.
ArrÍte, Leela!
- Ils ont tuť mes parents!
- Presque.
- Ce sont mes parents.
- Oui.
Le professeur m'a aidť
ŗ analyser le message.
- Et?
- Rien ŗ en tirer.
Mais l'analyse a rťvťlť
que c'ťtait du papier WC.
Une petite feuille froissable
utilisťe dans les ťgouts.
C'est ťcrit:
"Tes parents t'aiment trŤs fort."
C'est vrai.
Je ne suis donc pas un extraterrestre
mais une mutante?
Ca devait rester secret.
Tu mťrites mieux.
Tu dois sŻrement nous mťpriser.
Vous Ítes mes parents.
J'ai toujours rÍvť de vous connaÓtre.
C'est le plus beau jour de ma vie.

RANCH WONG
VOUS ETES CHEZ WONG
- Oui?
- Papa, je suis avec mes collègues.
Ouvre, Leo.
C'est Amy et ses amis bizarres.
Salut, les amis! Bienvenue sur Mars!
Merci de nous avoir invités. Je n'étais
jamais allée à un barbecue martien.
C'est mieux que sur Terre.
On met les ordures où on veut.
- Grande planète vide.
- Surtout, faites comme chez vous.
Je ne me suis pas gêné.
Au fait, il vous reste de ce bain
moussant Dom Pérignon?
Il y en avait assez pour ne remplir
la baignoire qu'à moitié.
Votre ranch est vraiment grand.
17,9 milliards d'hectares.
On possède tout l'hémisphère ouest.
- C'est le meilleur hémisphère.
- C'est pareil sur Terre.
Voici le produit plus numéro un.
Le Buggalo royal.
Utile pour tout: Viande, lait et
la carapace fait de bons canots.

Ne faites pas ça, s'il vous plaît.
Hé! Betsy!
C'est ma Betsy. Je l'ai élevée à partir
d'une larve qui rongeait mon pull.
On va la manger pour le mariage
d'Amy. Si elle se marie un jour.
Papa! Quelle horreur!
Ne va pas dire ça
devant mon copain ce soir.
Ah, c'est vrai. On va enfin passer
du temps avec ce M. Kif.
J'espère qu'il est gentil
et qu'il nous fera des petits.
On n'est pas dans un univers
parallèle où tu rajeunis.
Souviens-toi, pour atteindre le lit
d'une fille, on passe par les parents.
- Tu couches avec eux et c'est bon.
- J'ai un peu peur de les rencontrer.
C'est naturel.
Tu es faible et ennuyeux.
Tu t'en sortais avec les restes
de mon charisme.
Tu en profitais,
comme un minuscule parasite.
J'espère qu'ils m'aimeront.
Et pourquoi pas? Oui, je sais.
Minuscule, faible, ennuyeux.
Epargne-moi la triste histoire
de ta vie. Surtout, amuse-toi!
BONNE FETE DE MARS
On bouge!
Ouais! Balancez-nous une bombe
de basse-cour, Vanilla Corn!
Eh, l'imbécile!
Moi, c'est Mix-Master Festus.
SIROP POUR MAUX D'ESTOMAC
Qu'est-ce qu'on fête aujourd'hui?
On commémore le jour où
notre ancêtre, Sir Reginald Wong...
a acheté Mars aux idiots
d'autochtones.
Pourquoi les traitez-vous d'idiots?
Ils ont vendu la planète entière
pour une perle, ça me paraît idiot!
Oui, c'est idiot!
Vous riez de l'exploitation tragique
d'un peuple fier qui aime les perles.
Détends-toi. C'est drôle.
Bien sûr.
Mais vous n'êtes pas obligés de rire!
Non. Pas sur la planète
de tes parents.
Content de te voir de retour au pays.
C'est une bouffée d'oxygène.
R.J., voici mon petit ami, Kif.
Cette mauviette?
Tu as fait du chemin, ma belle.
- Cigarette, l'ami?
- Oh, je ne...
- Je ne l'ai même pas allumée.
- Ah. Elle est allumée maintenant?
Oui.
Tu es pathétique.
Hôte, hôtesse,
je passe un moment très agréable!
Vous êtes ici depuis 5 heures,
vous avez déjà troué le sofa...
et rempli la piscine de crevettes.
Pas mal pour un citadin, hein?
Au fait, j'ai pris la liberté
de féconder votre caviar.
Du calme. Je suis sûre
que mes parents vont t'adorer.
Quand je suis nerveux, je ne contrôle
plus mon réflexe de camouflage.
Oh là là. Oh, Seigneur.
Oh, comme c'est bizarre.
- Je veux un thorax et des tentacules.
- Avec de la salade?
Berk!
Maman? Papa?
Vous vous souvenez de Kif?
- Je ressens une aversion immédiate.
- Trop maigrelet pour être papa.
Il n'est pas maigrelet,
il a des petits os.
En fait, je n'ai pas d'os.
Je tiens debout
grâce à des vessies remplies...
Tu es une femmelette mollasse.
Amy devrait avoir un mec, comme lui.
Je peux être viril aussi. Je crois
que je vais me fumer une cigarette.
Mauvais sens.
C'est bon.
Regarde le côté positif.
Mes parents sont partis quand tu t'es
évanoui, ils ne t'ont pas vu gerber.
Maintenant, à leurs yeux, je ne serai
jamais assez viril pour sortir avec toi.
Ce n'est pas grave, Kif.
Je vais te chercher un mouchoir
dans ton sac.
Salut, Amy. Je voudrais te présenter
mon pote, Joe.
Désolé pour le retard. Ma partie de
billard a duré longtemps au club.
Tout le monde l'adore.
C'est quoi ce bruit bizarre?
Tempête de sable!
Tout le monde dans la maison.
Dépêchez-vous avant de mourir.
Essuyez-vous les pieds!
Tout va bien?
Personne ne va intenter un procès?
Je ressens un peu d'angoisse mentale.
- Je connais tous les juges d'ici.
- Je vais bien, alors.
La tempête se calme.
Leo, va voir si le troupeau va bien.
- Où sont les Buggalos?
- Volés sous couvert de la tempête!
- On est ruinés!
- Non!
T'inquiète pas, Papa. Ca va aller.
Ah, vraiment?
Et qui va nous sauver?
Neunœil? Le homard profiteur?
La poubelle ivrogne?
- On dirait un travail pour...
- Lt. Kif Kroker!
Bon, d'accord.
Ces Buggalos ont fait la fortune
et la puissance de la famille Wong.
Oh, Inez, on s'est fait voler!
On est ruinés!
D'accord. Je veux divorcer.
Maman! Papa!
Ne me demandez pas de choisir.
Ce ne sont pas tes parents. Je ne
suis pas ta sœur et ce n'est pas à toi.
Tout le monde se calme.
Kif a promis d'attraper les voleurs.
Mme Wong,
avez-vous un foulard à me prêter?
Mon plan est de prendre
les Buggalos restants...
et de les mener
sur un chemin rocailleux.
Quand les voleurs attaqueront,
je les arrêterai.
C'est dangereux.
Quelqu'un pourrait se faire tuer.
Fry? Leela? Bender?
Je veux que vous alliez avec lui.
Mince!
Ne vous inquiétez pas. Je vous
ramènerai le bétail ou je mourrai.
On n'a rien à perdre!
C'est trop risqué! Tu n'as pas
à faire ça pour prouver ta virilité.
Oh, que si!
Voici vos montures.
Elle a une belle robe.
On a besoin de Buggalos pour attirer
les voleurs. On en a combien?
Betsy, c'est la seule qui reste.
Elle était pelotonnée dans mon panier
pendant la tempête.
Elle t'aime bien.
Mettez-vous en selle!
On a des sales voleurs à attraper!
Nous avons le droit de nous frotter
Aux voleurs
Si quelqu'un veut se frotter à nous
Il ferait mieux de me mordre le cul
Oh! Le Mont Olympe! C'est le plus
grand volcan du système solaire.
- Où ca?
- Droit devant.
On campera près du sommet.
Les voleurs nous verront.
Où?
Et même avec l'ordinateur éteint
et débranché...
une image restait à l'écran.
C'était...
le logo Windows!
- Ca ne fait pas peur!
- Si t'es une imprimante laser, si!
A moi de raconter une histoire
de fantômes. Une femme conduisait...
- Crochet à la main!
- J'en ai une. Il y avait une famille...
L'homme dans le grenier!
M. Je-sais-tout-sur-une-chose,
tu racontes une histoire.
Avec plaisir.
Un jour, non loin d'ici, 4 personnes
étaient sur un chemin rocailleux...
Robot qui s'embête tue Fry
avec un marteau! Désolé, continue.
Alors qu'ils étaient assis
sans défense autour du feu...
un zombi mutant fou libertaire
échappé de l'asile s'approcha et...
Surprise!
Amy, qu'est-ce que tu fais là?
- J'ai oublié quelque chose.
- Ah. Quoi?
C'est ton réflexe de camouflage,
ou tu es content de me voir?
J'adore être au grand air, Amy.
Je me sens si viril.
J'ai une ampoule, je crache et je ne
dévoile mes sentiments à personne.
- Mais tu as des sentiments?
- Oui.
Mais je les garde pour moi jusqu'à
ce que je les note dans mon journal.
- C'est une nuit magnifique.
- C'est bien vrai.
Je pourrais rester près de toi
et contempler le ciel toute la nuit.
Pas moi.
- C'était quoi?
- On vient peut-être de faire l'amour.
Les Buggalos sont dans le cratère!
Les voleurs ont dû me voir
et s'enfuir!
- Oh, Kif. Tu es si courageux!
- Ils vont nous entendre.
D'accord, la dynamite est prête.
C'est la seule facon de les sortir?
Sauf si tes parents ont
des milliers d'hélicoptères.
- En fait...
- Trop tard! C'est drôle comme ça!
Kif, tu as réussi! Comment savais-tu
que la dynamite marcherait?
J'ai suivi un séminaire sur l'éjection
de poules de dunes de sable.
Le principe est essentiellement
le même.
C'est le bruit de "fin de barbecue"
encore une fois!
Tempête de sable!
- On est dans l'œil du cyclone!
- Où ca?
C'est quoi ça?
- Oh, mon Dieu!
- Qui sont-ils?
Nous sommes les Martiens
de souche.
Les Buggalos savent voler?
Seuls ceux qui vénèrent
Mars Nourricière les font voler.
Ceux-là seulement auront des Buggalos.
C'est nous.
Mais Votre Martien-nesse,
ces Buggalos ne sont pas à vous.
Ils appartiennent à la famille Wong.
Vous parlez de la famille qui nous a
pris nos terres pour une fichue perle?
Amy Wong. Et vous êtes?
Fâché après les Wong! On voulait
les ruiner en volant les Buggalos.
Mais maintenant on prend la fille
à la place.
Attendez! Je suis trop riche
pour me faire kidnapper!
Amy! Non!
Ne t'inquiète pas, Kif.
Je suis sûr qu'une autre belle fille
riche tombera amoureuse de toi.
Hourrah! Tu as ramené le troupeau!
Oui. Mais je dois vous apprendre
une mauvaise nouvelle aussi.
Laisse Amy nous le dire.
Ca sera plus facile à digérer.
Pourquoi on n'entend pas Amy?
Eh bien... C'est que...
Les Martiens kidnappé Amy!
NOUS VOULONS TERRE
C'est eux.
Pas bonne grammaire.
- Je ramènerai votre fille.
- Laisse tomber, mollasse.
Tu l'as perdue.
Tu en as assez fait.
Cette fois on prendra le policier
le plus décoré de l'univers!
Vous parlez de...?
Oh, non, je vous en supplie...
Je suis l'homme sans nom.
Zapp Brannigan, à votre service.
S'il vous plaît, on a besoin de vous
pour ramener notre fille.
Je m'occupe des dégâts de Kif. J'irai
moi-même négocier avec les Martiens.
- Vos soupirs m'intriguent.
- Les Martiens n'ont pas de terre.
Ils ont été encouragés à vivre
dans une réserve souterraine.
Personne n'a jamais osé s'y rendre.
Cette mission est très dangereuse!
Quelqu'un va être tué!
- Fry? Leela? Bender?
- Sois maudit, vieil homme!
Oh, regarde. Betsy t'a suivi, Kif.
Je n'avais pas réalisé
que tu amènerais ta copine, lieutenant.
Elle ne me laisse pas tranquille.
J'ai dit "copine"?
On dirait plutôt une épouse.
Regardez! Le grand visage
de pierre de Mars!
- La seule entrée de la réserve.
- Et le grand fessier de pierre?
C'est carrément de l'autre côté
de la planète.
Aux narines!
DEFENSE D'ENTRER
QUI ENTRERA SE SENTIRA COUPABLE
Je suis Vent Chantant.
Chef de la tribu martienne.
Je veux voir le responsable.
Bref, passons.
Pourquoi vous venez sur nos terres?
Pour négocier la libération
d'Amy Wong.
Pour clarifier les choses, une terre,
c'est le truc avec un ciel au-dessus.
- Ils ont du respect pour la planète.
- Cynthia buvait du Slurm.
On rendra fille quand on retournera
sur surface planète.
- Comment savoir si elle est en vie?
- Ca va.
Tu affaiblis notre pouvoir
de négociation. Si vous la rendez...
on sculptera nos présidents
dans votre montagne sacrée.
Vous gaspillez les mots.
On veut la terre qu'on nous a prise.
Vous l'avez échangée
contre une perle.
Tribu souffre des remords
de l'acheteur. On veut nos terres!
Mon peuple est un peuple de loi.
Et cette loi c'est:
Pas de retour en arrière.
Le temps des affirmations débiles
est fini.
Oh non!
Mon œil!
UNIVERSITE DE MARS
LE SAVOIR ENGENDRE LA PEUR
M'man! Pa! Notre précieux ranch!
Amy! Non! Il y a trop de vent!
Reste calme, ma chère!
Je te sauverai!
- Tu fais voler Betsy!
- Je t'emmène quelque part?
Grande Mars Nourricière!
Il a le don.
- Ouais, Kif!
- Bravo!
Kroker, c'était un acte héroïque
très Brannigan-esque.
On s'est trompés à ton égard, le Vert.
Tu fais voler le Buggalo, comme nous.
Tu vénères réellement Mars Nourricière.
- Que la paix soit entre nous.
- Oui, fumons le calumet de la paix.
Fumons?
Tiens, prends.
Non merci.
J'ai mis des patchs de paix.
Tu dois fumer calumet de la paix,
paisiblement. Sinon, on te tue.
C'est juste que je ne crois
pas que...
Ne fais pas la poule mouillée.
Les adolescents fument tous
et ils semblent tous être à la hauteur.
- Oui!
- Bien inspiré!
Hé, je fume! Je suis le meilleur!
Oh, trompettes de singe!
Tu as toussé à notre offre de paix,
alors tu dois mourir.
La perle utilisée pour briser
nos rêves va servir à briser tes os.
En fait, je n'ai pas d'os.
Je tiens debout
grâce à des vessies remplies...
C'est la perle que vous avez eue
en échange de vos terres?
C'est un diamant énorme!
Il doit valoir une fortune!
Vraiment?
Oh, chef, vous faites de moi
la fille la plus heureuse du monde!
Si vous voulez récupérer vos terres,
on peut re-échanger.
On a toujours cru que cette perle
ne valait rien, que...
nos ancêtres s'étaient fait avoir.
Ils n'avaient pas le concept
de possession.
- Alors, on peut avoir le diamant?
- Non. Nous avons ce concept.
Vous pouvez partir.
Désolé pour le vol et le kidnapping.
- Et vos terres sacrées?
- On s'en moque!
On ne veut pas vivre ici,
c'est un dépotoir.
On achètera une autre planète qu'on
dira sacrée. Qui va s'en plaindre?
Personne, c'est ainsi!
Kif est arrivé sur Betsy, m'a sauvée
et a fait la paix avec les Martiens.
C'est trop une mauviette!
Je suis sûre que c'est
Zapp Brannigan qui a tout fait.
Je vous en prie,
ce n'est pas assez d'honneur!
Capitaine, vous serez toujours
le bienvenu au Rancho Zoidberg.
L'argent ne rend pas
les gens honnêtes!
Merci de m'avoir sauvé la vie, Kif.
Tu es mon héros.
Tu es gentille. Mais tes parents
ne m'aiment pas pour autant.
Evidemment. Mais si tu leur plaisais,
je ne t'aimerais pas.
Tu ne connais rien aux filles ou quoi?
"Cher Journal, je viens de faire
l'amour pour la deuxième fois."

HEP... MEGATEUF CHEZ TOI
APRES L'EPISODE!
UN PHARAON INOUBLIABLE
A venir, un cambriolage
à la piscine municipale.
Mets-moi plus fort!
Aujourd'hui, un bandit ordurier
a cambriolé la piscine...
emportant le contenu de trois casiers.
Trois casiers et un lavabo.
- Tu es mêlé à ca?
- Bien sûr que non!
Sapristi!
Il porte un maillot moulant!
- Ça ne laisse aucun mystère.
- Sur un robot, si.
Un humain a vu le voleur.
Ça y est. Ça y est.
Le voleur serait méchant, musclé...
A moi la gloire!
...et de race blanche.
Quoi?
A quoi je vais passer mes journées?
C'est scandaleux!
A quoi bon faire le coup du siècle
si on ignore qui l'a fait?
- Pour le gain matériel.
- Cette camelote?
Tout ce que je voulais,
c'est qu'on se souvienne de mon nom.
C'est Bender.
A quoi bon essayer de se souvenir?
On oublie cinq secondes plus tard.
C'est tellement injuste.
Un robot raffiné,
enthousiaste et provocateur...
condamné à rester dans l'ombre
comme vous, et surtout Leela.
Si je mourrais demain,
personne ne broncherait.
Je ne l'ai jamais vu comme ça.
Je ne l'ai jamais vu, remarque.
Comment un inconnu
devient-il célèbre?
J'y suis!
Je suis coincé, mais je garde espoir.
Appelez les faits divers!
- Tu n'es pas coincé.
- La ferme!
Allez, on fait tous le Bender!
Ce pas s'appelle le Bender!
On fait de l'expression libre,
pas du fascisme!
Un mur vierge! A moi la gloire!
Personne n'oubliera
comment je vois les choses.
BENDER VOUS BOTTE LE CUL!
Foutez-moi en l'air
ces apparts d'artistes.
Non!
BENDER EST UN LECHE-CUL!
Je suis le premier au travail.
Ça s'arrange pas.
Surprise!
Joyeux enterrement, Bender!
Un enterrement-surprise, pour moi?
Pour te prouver que tu es inoubliable.
Si le défunt veut bien
prendre la place d'honneur...
C'est douillet! Un mini-bar!
Honorons ensemble
la mémoire de Bender...
renversé par un semi-remorque
conduit par l'Incroyable Hulk.
Tu connais
ma cause de décès préférée.
Souvenons-nous
de ce que l'on préférait chez Bender.
Professeur?
Un robot standard est fait
d'un alliage de fer et d'osmium.
Mais Bender a un défaut:
Il contient 0,04% de nickel.
Ça fait mon originalité.
Dès qu'on voulait éviter
les rayons X à la douane...
Bender nous offrait
sa cavité ventrale.
- Le professeur a fait mieux.
- Tu es censé être mort.
Faites-moi des éloges.
Pleurez un peu!
On dirait que vous attendez le bus.
Qui ca?
C'est mon enterrement, et tu chantes
pour un cadavre du nom de Danny-boy?
Quel abruti tu fais!
- J'exprime ma peine.
- T'es viré!
Je te dirais bien de garder
ton vrai boulot, mais tu es trop nul!
- On fait de notre mieux.
- C'est raté.
On se reprend, les gars.
C'est de pire en pire.
J'ai crevé. Montrez que vous m'aimiez.
- Bender était exceptionnel...
- Plus fort et plus triste!
- Bender était exceptionnel...
- Suivant!
- Seigneur...
- Suivant!
Quelqu'un sait-il
à quel point je suis génial?
Oui, Bender.
Bender représentait beaucoup
pour nous tous.
Mais voilà la première chose
qui me vient à l'esprit:
Bender était mon ami.
Quoi? C'est tout?
Tu es nul! C'est le pire enterrement
que j'aie jamais vu!
Bravo, vous m'avez convaincu
de la valeur de la vie.
Mon enterrement
fait vraiment trop pitié!
On a notre prochain enterré!
Oh, je t'en prie.
LE MAGAZINE
DU ROBOT RENFROGNE
J'ai du nouveau!
Aujourd'hui, vous allez à O'Cyris 4
livrer cet énorme bloc de grès.
Je sentais que quelque chose
avait changé.
Salut. On a une pierre géante
à livrer. Signez là.
Pas mal!
Tout comme toutes les pierres...
utilisées pour le futur tombeau
du pharaon Hermenthotip.
Impressionnant.
Qui va le construire?
- Vous.
- Pardon?
Vous êtes désormais esclaves
du pharaon Hermenthotip. Gardes!
J'ai comme un mauvais pressentiment.
Le pire, dans l'esclavage,
c'est le travail forcé sans salaire.
C'est le principe de l'esclavage.
Vous êtes maintenant la propriété
du pharaon Hermenthotip...
qui a mis à profit
les crues annuelles.
On dirait l'Egypte ancienne
de mon époque!
C'est normal.
On a visité votre Egypte
il y a des milliers d'années.
Je le savais! La théorie
la plus folle peut être la bonne.
On a appris à faire des pyramides,
à voyager dans l'espace...
et à faire en sorte que nos morts
effraient Abbott et Costello.
Ainsi que Wolfman.
Super tombeaux!
Ils savent comment mourir, ici.
Ils ont tué des esclaves
pour construire ces monuments.
Avec un orteil de cette taille,
on se souvient de toi.
Je crois que je vais me plaire ici.
PERDEZ DU POIDS
DE SUITE
J'ai vu votre enseigne.
Comment perdre du poids?
On vous fait mourir de faim.
QUE FERAIT LE PHARAON?
Un, deux, trois, tirez!
Un, deux, trois, tirez!
Nom d'un crocodile!
Allez, les gars!
On a un boulot à faire!
On doit vraiment compter jusqu'à 3?
Pourquoi pas un? Ou un demi?
Bonne idée, esclave. Un demi, tirez!
Ça, c'est de l'esclavage!
Le pharaon compte sur nous.
Plus vite. Comme ca.
Vous êtes censé me stimuler.
Ne fouettez pas avec le bras.
Ça doit partir des hanches.
Arrête de leur donner des tuyaux!
- On est tes amis, tu te souviens?
- Tu sais de qui je me souviens?
Çasuffis! Toutankatruc! Chaipluqui!
Le plus grand de tous.
Le pharaon Hermenthotip approche!
Vite! Le pharaon arrive!
Montez vite ce nez!
Excellent travail.
Je suis fier de tous mes esclaves.
Viva Hermenthotip!
J'ai une grande déclaration à faire.
En l'honneur de votre travail,
vous êtes tous...
Non!
Dis aux esclaves qu'ils peuvent...
Aller plus vite? Ils sont paresseux.
Non, ils peuvent partir...
- Partir travailler? Bonne idée.
- Non, je...
Le pharaon Hermenthotip est mort.
Il fouette désormais les anges.
Nous emmenons le corps d'Hermenthotip
dans la demeure sacrée.
Sacrée soirée.
Le pharaon m'avait demandé
de dire cette blague.
Je ne t'oublierai jamais,
Hermenthotip.
Ses choses préférées l'accompagneront
dans son voyage.
Comme son cœur et son foie.
PROPRIETE DU PHARAON
Et tout ce qu'il avait laissé
dans son garage royal.
Et ce sac de chats,
que notre culture considère sacrés.
Pharaon, mon roi
Tu es mort, tu es froid
Autrefois, il chantait avec moi
Le pharaon et ses chats
Mais c'est fini
Le pharaon est parti
Susie l'aura rejoint au paradis
Hermenthotip nous a quittés.
Il faut désigner un autre pharaon.
Joli!
A l'aube, le grand prêtre
consultera le Mur Prophétique...
et désignera le prochain pharaon.
Vous n'êtes pas obligés de rentrer,
mais vous ne pouvez pas rester.
PRAIRIES DE LA LIBERTE
QUARTIER DES ESCLAVES
C'est dingue, le pharaon est mort!
Ce soir, on n'est plus esclaves.
Sauf du rythme.
Fais résonner tes bongos!
Je tournerai
jusqu'à en perdre l'équilibre.
Nous interrompons l'ancienne prophétie
pour un bulletin de dernière minute.
Grand Mur Prophétique,
révèle-nous la volonté des dieux.
Délivre-nous
de toute réflexion et responsabilité.
- On lira sur tes facades.
- Alors, écris.
- Tes mots nous guident.
- On est idiots.
L'autre hic à propos de l'esclavage,
ce sont les horaires.
La prophétie est étrange,
et grossièrement dessinée.
Elle indique qu'on est ici...
et que notre prochain pharaon
est là-bas, près des tentes.
Ce sont des vagues, imbécile!
C'est une rivière.
- Je sais qui est le pharaon.
- Oh, non.
Nous entendons ta voix, grand pharaon.
Fais ton apparition.
Ecoutez-moi! Je viens du royaume
des enchantements et des fées.
C'est lui.
Le Mur Prophétique l'avait prédit.
Longue vie au pharaon Bender!
- Longue vie au pharaon Bender.
- Quelle bande d'idiots!
Peuple d'O'Cyris 4!
Du rang d'esclave, il est devenu
notre maître tout puissant:
Notre nouveau pharaon, Bender!
Mes citoyens, la cruauté
du dernier pharaon, c'est du passé.
Qu'une nouvelle vague de cruauté
lave ce pays paresseux.
Il a dit quoi?
Obéissez au pharaon!
Construisez-moi une statue démesurée!
Des milliards de mètres cubes...
afin qu'on se souvienne de moi
pour l'éternité!
Et magnez-vous un peu.
- Pourquoi ne travailles-tu pas?
- Je travaille.
Je voulais dire "à mort".
Pharaon, j'ai mal quand je respire.
Alors que faudrait-il
arrêter de faire?
Rampez, bande de porcs!
Le pharaon a parlé.
FESSES PHARAONIQUES
0 JOURS
DEPUIS LE DERNIER ACCIDENT
C'est presque terminé.
Ne laissez pas tomber votre pharaon.
Le grand monument est terminé.
Dévoilons-le.
Souvenez-vous de moi!
Ça vous plaît, maître?
C'est un bon début.
Elle est grande, c'est certain.
Peut-être un peu trop, non?
Se souviendra-t-on de moi
ou de la statue?
Nous avons suivi vos instructions.
Trop scrupuleusement.
Détruisez-la et recommencez.
Cette fois, ne vous ridiculisez pas.
Mesdames et messieurs,
le pharaon est mort.
- Bon débarras.
- Et mes servants?
- Ah, oui.
- C'est vrai.
Bender, j'espère que c'est toi,
sinon...
on est mal.
Salaud! Pourquoi nous faire couler?
Je voulais vous voir
vous souvenir de moi.
Tu gardais tout ça
pour une autre vie?
Une autre vie?
Si une autre vie m'attendait,
je me tuerais.
Pourris en paix.
Nous, on se tire.
Il n'y a aucune issue.
Rien n'entre ni ne sort.
Sauf ces millions de serpents.
Un peu de schnaps
de grenade fait maison...
à la mémoire
de ce bon vieux Bender.
Combien de degrés?
Un nombre à 3 chiffres?
C'est explosif!
Si on mettait le feu,
on ferait tout exploser.
Un peu de bois d'allumage.
Ne détruis pas ma statue!
On m'oubliera!
Je suis tellement égoïste.
Restons ici pour toujours.
Tu te souviens de ce robot, Bender?
Bender? Ca ne me dit rien.
- Tu entends quelque chose?
- Non.
Ce n'est sûrement pas un bon voleur.
Arrêtez! Vous dépassez les bornes!
- Tu sais de qui je me souviens?
- Moi!
- Celui qui piquait des trucs.
- Moi!
- Hermès!
- D'accord, c'est bon!
Si c'est si important,
détruisez ma statue.
Bender! Tu es là depuis quand?
Ne bouge pas.
Faisons péter le tombeau.
Pharaon Bender!
Il revient parmi les vivants!
Ca va?
Souvenez-vous de moi.
Je me souviendrai.
Je t'en prie, laisse-moi seul.
C'est normal
de ne pas vouloir qu'on t'oublie.
Mais tu n'as pas besoin
de statue pour ça.
- Ah non?
- Non.
On se souviendra
de ta dictature tyrannique.
Ça vaut bien plus qu'un monument.
- Ils se souviendront de moi?
- Absolument.
Dans ce cas,
ça fait une planète de moins.
Timoniers, en route vers la Terre!
Ce n'est pas la Terre.

ETEIGNEZ VOS PORTABLES
ET TRICORDERS
LES AFFRANCHIS DE DIEU
- Des pirates de l'espace!
- Quoi?
Des pirates, mais dans l'espace!
Mille sabords, moussaillons!
Transférez électroniquement
vos doublons de l'espace...
avant que je vous propulse
au fin fond de l'espace!
Mettez-la en veilleuse,
j'essaie de faire la sieste!
PROTEGE-TYMPANS
OREILLES
Allez, allez!
Obliger Bender à faire la sieste
dans un tube!
Reviens quand j'aurai
un peu dormi, ma jolie.
Fry, à ton poste!
Lancement de la torpille trois!
Torpille numéro trois lancée!
Ce n'est pas la torpille trois!
Rien à voir!
Allez au diable, Fry et Leela!
BUTIN
Je réalise trop tard que mes enfants
sont ce que j'ai de plus cher.
Au secours! Un homme mécanique
dans l'espace!
Suis-le, Leela!
On était à fond quand on l'a projeté.
Il va donc plus vite que nous.
On peut pas le rattraper, même avec
du sang de guépard dans le moteur?
Je ne sais comment te le dire...
mais Bender est condamné à errer
dans l'espace. Pour toujours.
Il a toujours voulu errer...
mais dans le Sud-Ouest américain!
Je vais trop vite.
Je dois perdre de la vitesse.
Je vais passer l'éternité seul
avec presque pas de butin!
L'univers! Regarde-moi ce type
avec sa Rolex!
Pas discret! Mais à quoi bon
un chandelier sans...
Un instant, j'ai trouvé!
Qu'il est dommage!
Condamné à errer dans le vide,
tel le jouet de la pesanteur.
Ô cruel destin d'être ainsi réduit!
Ne t'en va pas demander pour qui sonne
le réveil. Il sonne pour toi.
La seule chose qui me sauve...
c'est de penser que j'ai l'éternité
devant moi pour parfaire mon art.
Va au diable!
Quand on me retrouvera,
les gens verront qui avait le dessus!
Qu'est-ce qui me bombarde?
Non, un champ d'astéroïdes!
Ne serait-ce qu'un mini astéroïde
dans mon crâne...
me ferait du mal.
C'était marrant. Maintenant,
quelques ères de solitude!
Amis Crevetasses, voici celui
qui nous a accueillis en son sein.
Seigneur!
Prosternez-vous devant le grand
Seigneur de Fer!
Des adorateurs? Ca devrait égayer
mon terrible voyage sans fin.
- Salut à vous, Seigneur de Fer!
- Nous te saluons.
Ces nabots pensent que je suis Dieu.
Dur de leur en vouloir.
- Je suis le Seigneur de Fer. Et toi?
- On me nomme Malachi.
Ca signifie "Celui qui adore
le Seigneur de Fer."
C'est l'heure d'un don pour les croyants,
passe-moi ton portefeuille!
Mais nous sommes de pauvres
et simples gens.
Pauvres? Quelle saloperie!
Quelle bénédiction d'être entouré
de l'amour de sa famille!
- Que fais-tu, Malachi fils?
- Je m'entraîne à câliner papa!
Ca me fait gerber!
Il est temps que je te dicte
des commandements.
Tu as un burin?
Prends note. Numéro un...
Voici le 1er commandement:
DIEU DOIT PICOLER
Et un double!
- Vous arrivez à le voir, professeur?
- Non, pas avec ce Flairoscope.
L'odeur de Bender est si légère que
des sources locales l'ont absorbée.
Hourra, on prête attention à moi!
Voici quelqu'un pour te réconforter!
Il s'appelle Assistant.
Il a hâte d'être ton nouvel ami.
Salut, vieux!
Ton pote te manque?
Tiens, une sucette!
- On va dans un parc d'attractions?
- D'accord.
- Eclate-toi! Bender est de retour.
- Quoi? Vraiment?
Non, je me suis dit
que tu apprécierais ce moment!
Seigneurweiser
Ca a bien fermenté!
Ils ont fait du bon boulot!
Je crois que je vais faire
quelque chose pour eux.
Bon boulot! Ce soir,
c'est le Seigneur de Fer qui régale!
- Oui, ce soir c'est spécial.
- T'as arraché ton bras pour blaguer?
Non. Comme beaucoup, j'ai été blessé
en construisant la brasserie.
D'autres sont morts des fumées
qui en jaillissaient.
Et bien sûr, l'industrie de l'alcool
a attiré le grand banditisme.
Tout est de ma faute.
Malachi, dis à ton peuple
que le Seigneur est ému de votre sort.
- Malachi fils, non!
- Papa, je ne peux pas tenir.
- J'ai fait trop de câlins.
- Sauvez mon fils, Seigneur de Fer!
Ca m'a tout l'air d'un boulot
pour Dieu!
Qu'est-ce... Malachi, ça veut dire
quoi tous ces chants religieux?
Vous avez sauvé mon fils. Tous prient
pour qu'un miracle leur arrive.
Très bien. Que veulent-ils?
Le peuple de ce village
prie pour sa richesse.
C'était un miracle d'entraînement.
Suivant!
Les fermiers prient
pour du soleil...
pour que leur orge fasse de la bière
plus rafraîchissante.
Très bien. Que la lumière soit!
Je m'en charge!
Quand tu écriras la Bible, il va
falloir omettre ce dernier miracle.
APPARTEMENTS DE ROBOTS
Il a décidé de ne pas lâcher prise.
Impossible que tu ne sois plus là!
Non!
Si je savais où tu étais,
je ferais un truc dément!
PREMIERE EGLISE AMALGAMEE
Je vous ai tout dit,
Père Changstein el Gamahl.
- La religion ne peut pas m'aider?
- On peut s'unir dans la prière.
- Et quelque chose d'utile?
- Non.
Oui, je fais une séance pour ton ami.
Pas de problème. Introduis ta pièce.
Je suis ton ami, Bonder.
- Bonder? C'est bien toi?
- Oui. Donne 10 $ à la gitane.
Un instant! Bender ne s'appelle pas
Bonder, mais Bender. Escroc!
- Tu veux de faux espoirs ou non?
- Que s'il n'y a pas vraiment d'espoir.
Il y a peut-être une solution.
Connais-tu les moines de Shubah?
- Non, je ne les connais pas.
- C'est un ordre ancien...
qui croit en l'existence de Dieu
dans l'espace.
Ils ont construit un puissant
radiotélescope...
dans l'Himalaya pour le rechercher.
- Je pourrais rechercher Bender avec?
- Tu me crois devin?
Enfin, oui!
Oui, c'est sûr, c'est possible!
Ô Seigneur de Fer,
entendez ma prière!
Oui, Malachi.
Qu'y a-t-il, cette fois-ci?
Les infidèles sur votre dos
ne croient plus en vous.
Leurs prières demeurent ignorées.
Comment veux-tu que j'entende
des prières qui sortent de mon cul?
Ils parlent de guerre contre nous.
Je vous en prie, révoltez-vous!
Châtiez quelqu'un qui le mérite,
pour une fois!
Chaque fois que j'interviens,
j'aggrave les choses.
- Vous devez régler vos problèmes.
- Mais Seigneur de Fer...
Quelle partie de "non"
ne comprends-tu pas?
MATERIEL DE RANDONNEE
& SPELEOLOGIE
Je pars en expédition dans l'Himalaya.
Il me faut un manteau.
Bender me manque presque autant
que toi, mais c'est sans espoir.
On n'abandonne pas
parce que c'est sans espoir.
Il faut plus espérer,
se boucher les oreilles et faire ca!
- J'aimerais aussi une mule chargée!
- Tout de suite!
Tu refuses d'entendre raison.
Je vais donc écouter tes idioties
et venir avec toi.
Mais il nous faut un Sherpa
pour nous guider.
LA BIBLE par BENDER,
avec MALACHI
Ca, c'est une Bible
qui n'est pas décevante!
Cette société fonctionne bien
quand je ne me mêle pas...
Des bombes atomiques? Ces infidèles
ont dû trouver ma pile nucléaire.
Soyez sans crainte!
On sera bientôt avec vous.
C'est le niveau maximum
pour être avec moi!
On résoudra nos problèmes. L'heure
est venue de convertir les infidèles.
- Les convertir?
- En vapeur radioactive!
Regarde, papa!
Je fais un câlin à Dieu!
Si je le serre fort dans mes bras,
il nous sauvera de...
Non!
Ca chatouille!
Il y a quelqu'un en vie?
Quelqu'un dans le cinéma porno?
Ne soyez pas gênés!
Ils sont morts. Tous.
Qui aurait su que jouer à Dieu pouvait
avoir de telles conséquences?
Si je meurs d'épuisement, assure-toi
que mon corps gèle en position digne.
Pas dans une foutue position
recroquevillée!
Le voici! Le monastère de Shubah.
Je dois partir.
Je ne suis pas assez pieux.
Ca a l'air bancal.
On ferait mieux de tester.
Bienvenue dans notre monastère.
Ne restez pas au milieu pour
que les pèlerins rapides avancent.
Cette galaxie envoie des signaux
binaires. Je dois lui répondre!
Mais je sais juste demander où sont
les toilettes. Vous parlez anglais?
Maintenant, oui.
Vous êtes quoi,
un ordinateur galactique?
Possible. Je suis convivial,
mon vieux!
- Qui vous a construit?
- J'ai toujours existé.
Oh, mon Dieu! Vous êtes Dieu?
Possible. Je ressens de la compassion
pour tout être vivant, mon vieux!
Pourquoi Dieu penserait en binaire?
A moins de ne pas être Dieu...
mais les restes d'une sonde spatiale
informatique qui a percuté Dieu!
Ca semble probable.
Un membre de notre confrérie est
constamment à ces commandes.
Il scrute les cieux
à la recherche de Dieu.
Le voici! Non.
Quoique... Non!
- Depuis combien de temps ça dure?
- 700 ans.
On n'a pas encore examiné
un dix-millionième du ciel.
Nous trouverons le Tout-Puissant
même si cela dure une éternité.
- Et après?
- On lui dira une petite prière.
Le télescope est aussi
un transmetteur amplificateur.
- Comme un karaoké géant?
- Pas vraiment.
- Vous voulez voir notre karaoké?
- Pas vraiment.
Trouver Dieu, c'est important...
mais ce serait chouette si je pouvais
m'en servir pour trouver mon ami.
Je ne sais pas quoi dire, à part...
pas question!
- C'est tragique, mais notre boulot...
- Vous avez toute l'éternité.
Moi, je n'ai qu'une vie
pour le chercher!
Il parle de son ami avec amour.
Cet amour vient peut-être de Dieu.
Comme c'est pratique! Une théorie
sur Dieu sans l'aide d'un télescope.
Au boulot!
Ce télescope est autant à moi
qu'à vous!
Je m'en servirai avec ou sans
votre permission!
Vous êtes connus en arts martiaux,
mais je peux battre tout homme saint.
En fait, nous ne pratiquons
que pour méditer.
Nous sommes non-violents.
Filez dans la buanderie
ou je vous botte le derrière!
C'est la pire des sectes
dans laquelle j'ai été!
Vous savez ce que je vais faire
avant de le faire?
- Oui.
- Et si je fais un truc différent?
- Ca, je l'ignore.
- Bien, bien.
- Les gens vous font des prières?
- Et ils en demandent tant!
On finit par faire la sourde oreille.
J'ai été Dieu, une fois.
J'ai vu. Tu te débrouillais bien
avant qu'ils meurent.
Ca a été atroce. J'ai essayé
de les aider, de ne pas les aider.
A la fin, je ne faisais rien de bien.
Vous pensez que j'ai mal fait?
Le bien et le mal, ce sont des mots.
L'important, c'est ce que tu fais.
C'est pour ça que je demande
si ce que j'ai fait... Laissez tomber!
Bender, être Dieu n'est pas facile.
Tu en fais trop, on ne se passe plus
de toi. Tu ne fais rien, on perd espoir.
Tu dois être agile, comme un perceur
de coffre-fort ou un pickpocket.
Ou un type qui brûle son bar
pour l'assurance!
Oui, si ça a l'air
d'un incident électrique.
Si tu fais bien les choses, on ne se
doutera pas de ce que tu as fait.
Vous ne me renverrez pas sur Terre,
même si je prie pour vous?
La Terre? C'est par où?
Je ne sais pas.
Bender?
On veut sortir! On a fait cuire
nos chaussures et on les a mangées.
On s'ennuie!
- Quelqu'un aurait vu Bender?
- Non! Arrêtez de demander!
Ca fait trois jours. Même si tu restes
ici jusqu'à la fin de tes jours...
il n'y a quasiment aucune chance
de le trouver. Tu dois abandonner.
Tu as raison.
Je ne le reverrai jamais.
Je sais qu'il était méchant.
A plus d'une occasion...
il a volé mon sang.
Mais quand même,
j'aimerais que Bender revienne.
J'aimerais que Bender revienne!
Hein?
- Quoi? Vous avez dit quelque chose?
- Non, non.
Bon, à bientôt!
Rappelle-toi de ce qu'on a dit.
Chaud! Chaud! Chaud!
Bender! C'est un miracle!
C'est de loin ce qu'il y avait
de plus imprévisible!
Vous ne me croirez jamais! D'abord,
j'étais Dieu puis je l'ai rencontré!
- On a enfermé des moines!
- Oh, non!
On a oublié de les sortir
de la buanderie!
On doit vraiment? Ce sont des moines.
Leur Dieu le fera...
- ou leur donnera d'autres chaussures.
- Tu parles!
On ne peut pas compter sur Dieu!
C'est lui-même qui me l'a dit!
Venez! Si on ne sauve pas
ces moines, personne ne le fera!
Si tu fais bien les choses, on ne se
doutera pas de ce que tu as fait.

PLANET EXPRESS
REUNION DES ACTIONNAIRES
Heureusement qu'ils ont
la même forme.
Actionnaires de Planet Express.
Je vous présente notre PDG,
le professeur Hubert Farnsworth.
- Le voilà!
- Retire tout!
- Où suis-je?
- Avancez! Allez vers la lumière!
Mon Dieu, je suis mort!
Tant pis.
Merci à tous d'être venus.
Je ne reconnais personne,
et je ne sais plus ce que je fais ici.
Voici, sans délai...
un film sur Planet Express
au cours de l'année fiscale écoulée.
Planet Express est en marche!
Pour cette jeune société de courses,
demain, c'est aujourd'hui...
et aujourd'hui, c'est hier!
Enfin, vous m'avez compris.
Cette année a été marquée par de gros
bénéfices et une seule perte importante.
Ca me donne faim.
Viens m'aider à trouver à manger.
Je vais faire mieux.
Je vais t'aider à trouver et à manger.
Une Bot-Mitzvah!
Shalom, bouffe gratos.
Pas de crustacés!
- C'est vraiment pas juste.
- Tu m'étonnes!
Alors? Vous ne croyez pas
en Robot-Jésus?
Il a bien été construit et programmé,
mais ce n'était pas notre Messie.
Et notre société continue
d'aller de l'avant.
Planet Express: Un potentiel
sans limites, des horizons infinis!
L 'ineffable bulldozer
du monde de l'entreprise!
Cette année a été très mauvaise.
Nous sommes au bord de la faillite.
- Mais le film...
- Nous a coûté une fortune.
La partie bleue représente
l'argent gagné cette année.
Et la partie verte, une erreur
de la banque de 8 $, en notre faveur.
Et nos milliers d'actions?
- Zéro.
- Je vais te tuer!
J'ai une action Planet Machin-chose,
j'ai droit à des réponses.
Question: Pourquoi personne
ne me rend jamais visite?
Votre appartement sent le Polygrip
et la pisse de chat!
CRYOGENISES ANONYMES
C'est juste ce qu'il me faut!
BUFFET GRATUIT
Est-ce qu'il faut avoir été congelé
par cryogénisation pour le...
J'avais pas fini!
J'allais dire "buffet gratuit"!
- Je m'appelle Joe et je suis un dégivré.
- Bonjour, Joe!
Avant, les carottes dirigeaient
la Terre.
Mais plus maintenant.
C'est pas rien de s'habituer.
Dans les années 1980,
j'étais au top à Wall Street.
C'était whisky avec Boesky
et biscuits avec Milken.
Mais on m'a diagnostiqué
une ositose aiguë.
Ositose? C'est marrant comme nom,
pour une maladie horrible.
Il n'y avait aucun traitement.
Un laboratoire touchait au but...
mais j'ai organisé un rachat hostile
et tout liquidé. Le jackpot.
Je me suis congelé en attendant
un traitement.
Et me voilà, prêt à tout pour remonter
au sommet! Comme dans les années 80.
Ma position d'homme des cavernes
gelé dans un glacier est très pénible.
Le pire a sûrement été de voir
ma femme exposée au British Museum.
Je viens de la même époque.
Tu te souviens de "Safety Dance"?
Tu parles!
C'est pas bizarre comme titre?
Deux Reaganautes des années 80
comme nous, pourraient être des rois ici!
- C'est vrai.
- Si on nous aidait à démarrer...
Ils ont peur de nous! Mais si tu veux
un boulot, je peux supplier ma boîte.
Trop fort! Franchement trop fort!
Et enfin, le compte à la poste est
réservé au courrier professionnel.
Allez, quoi! J'ai plein
de demandes de rançon à envoyer!
Assez parlé! Place à l'action!
Je propose
qu'on aille tous chez moi...
- voir mon chat!
- J'approuve.
- Votre chat pue et il est moche!
- J'approuve.
Je propose qu'on élise un nouveau PDG
et qu'on vire ce vieux gâteux!
- Et j'ajoute que mon chat sent bon.
- J'approuve.
- Très bien. Je propose le professeur.
- Approuvé!
- Je suis votre homme!
- Je donne mes voix au professeur.
- Le professeur!
- Moi!
TOTAL DES VOTES
Je propose ce type.
Pas à cause de son costard, mais
parce qu'il s'y connaît et il a une cravate.
Les actions comptent,
même passées en machine?
PROFESSEUR: 50000
CE TYPE: 10000
Si je sais comparer deux chiffres...
Attendez! Scruffy donne
ses 40000 voix à l'inconnu.
40000?
C'est quatre fois plus que nous!
Scruffy croit en cette société.
Egalité. Dans cette éventualité,
le professeur, actuel PDG, reste...
Je demande la parole!
Je n'ai peut-être qu'une voix,
mais j'ai le droit de voter!
Et je vote contre l'ennemi des chats!
C'est pas vrai, mon minou?
T'as mangé ma monnaie!
C'est réglé. Le nouveau PDG
de Planet Express est...
"ce type"!
Je vous demande d'accueillir
notre nouveau PDG: Ce type!
Il y a deux sortes de personnes:
Les moutons et les requins.
Les moutons sont virés.
Qui est un mouton?
Lequel des deux
aime-t-on prendre dans ses bras?
Bonne question! Vous êtes un requin.
Les requins ne se retournent pas...
parce qu'ils n'ont pas de cou.
Seuls les moutons ont un cou.
Je suis fier d'être le berger
de ce troupeau de requins...
et je vais vous mener au sommet
des entreprises de...
- Coursiers.
- Coursiers? Oh, mon Dieu!
Formidable! Avant toute chose, tout
mettre sur le dos de mon prédécesseur.
Je vous ruinerai comme j'ai ruiné
cette société!
Super! Première question:
Quelle était votre stratégie commerciale?
Stratégie? Oui. Je garde ça là,
près de mon cœur.
C'est pas une stratégie commerciale,
c'est un plan d'évasion.
Salut, les nuls!
Fry, en tant que type qui vient des
années 80, je te nomme vice-président.
Mon ascension a commencé!
- C'est la fin!
- On est ruinés!
Quel est le rêve enfiévré
qui a déchiré cette société?
Merci. A bientôt.
C'est ce que j'appelle
un costume qui tue. Du gel?
Non, merci. Je le fabrique moi-même.
Cette société va monter au sommet
et y rester. Comme Cindy Lauper!
Je vous pose la question:
Qui est le numéro un des coursiers?
- Est-ce Planet Express, maître?
- C'est un requin, lui, ou quoi?
Franchement, on est nuls.
Voilà le gros morceau.
MAMAN CHOUCHOUTE VOS COLIS
La société de courses de Maman.
Ils sont gros et agressifs.
Nous, on est petits et neutres.
La Suisse est petite et neutre. Soyons
l'Allemagne, ambitieuse et incomprise.
On voudrait tous être comme
l'Allemagne, mais en a-t-on la force?
Je réponds oui! Allons-nous nous
laisser battre par une vieille dame?
Oui, mon seigneur.
Non! Je m'exprime pour le conseil
en adressant ce défi à Maman!
Regarde mon cul!
Une boîte dans la mouise, ça?
Walt, le bouton de représailles!
- Alors...
- N'importe lequel! C'est les mêmes!
AUJOURD'HUI
COMBAT DE GORILLE
Cogne-le, cogne-le!
Ca, c'est la grande vie!
Regarder des gorilles s'entretuer.
De mon temps on prenait de la coke,
mais le principe est le même.
Vire ton tricycle de là,
espèce de sale gorille puant!
Maintenant que tu es mon protégé...
il est temps que je te donne quelques
tuyaux pour réussir. Tu devines?
- Travailler très dur?
- Non.
- Merci, mon Dieu!
- Tout est une question d'image.
Il est temps de rafraîchir
notre société...
et de lui donner la ligne pure
et rutilante des années 1980!
Cette société fonce vers les sommets.
A nous la gloire!
On n'a pas fait une seule livraison
depuis que vous êtes patrons.
Les livraisons n'ont rien à voir
avec nos affaires.
L'image!
Regardez un peu cette nouvelle pub!
Nous ne sommes qu'un. Un seul esprit.
Un seul but. Une seule action.
Nos ennemis seront dévorés
par les scorpions.
Et nous nous prosternerons
pour nous vénérer nous-mêmes.
Nous vaincrons!
On regardait, nous!
Quelle horreur!
Ca dit même pas ce qu'on fait.
On fait quoi? Je rigole.
Tu nous prends pour quoi?
- Tu as approuvé cette pub, Fry?
- Oui...
et je vais vous dire pourquoi.
Elle grandit la marque.
Oh, Seigneur...
Cette boîte file un mauvais coton!
Je vendrais mes parts pour un sandwich.
Vendu!
Un sandwich entier!
Vous vous êtes fait avoir. J'aurais
dit oui pour une tartine au ketchup.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce torchon?
"Les nouveaux rois des coursiers"?
J'en ai assez de ces nullards!
- Mais c'est des rois, maman.
- Fous-les toi où je pense, débile!
Profitez de notre salon privé
où dînent nos clients les plus brillants.
Ce soir, c'est nous.
- Qu'avez-vous hors de prix?
- Tout.
- Donnez-moi ca.
- Pareil. Et un verre d'eau.
Travaillons ton vocabulaire de patron.
Je m'inquiète pour "X".
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Laisse-moi m'inquiéter pour "X".
Bien. J'aurais aussi accepté:
"X? X!
Tu n'as pas une vision d'ensemble!"
Quelle agréable surprise!
La ferme, morveux!
Il est temps qu'on discute.
Je m'en occupe, Fry. Rentre au bercail
trouver quelques paradigmes.
J'y vais. Mais si tu as besoin de moi,
tu sais où me trouver.
CAVE A VIN
Me traiter de morveux, moi!
Je lui en...
- On est inquiets pour Planet Express.
- Laissez-moi m'inquiéter pour "X".
Ce type est un escroc et
tu t'es laissé hypnotiser par sa saucisse!
- Tu as changé, Fry.
- Quoi? J'ai pas changé.
- Suz, j'ai changé?
- Non, M. Fry.
Merci, poupée.
Ca m'est égal. Ce type transforme
cet endroit en une sorte de commerce.
C'est pas un commerce!
J'ai toujours vu ça...
comme un boulot facile.
Comme une famille.
C'est vrai. On n'est pas une famille
classique comme les Murphy...
ou les sorcières lesbiennes d'en face,
mais quand même. Ce type l'a compris.
Tout le monde est viré. On ferme.
Je vends Planet Express à Maman.
Elle la détruira et nous éliminera.
Attention que la porte
ne se referme pas sur vous.
Je ne veux pas de traces de culs
sur ma porte!
Mlle Johnson, faites le plein
de ma chaise, s'il vous plaît.
Je ne savais pas que la boîte serait
vendue! Je faisais juste de la lèche.
Laisse-nous vider nos casiers
tranquillement.
C'est tellement triste!
Où je vais aller? Pour faire quoi?
Vous avez la fête de Mlle Darlinghaven
à 19 h, Madame.
Ca va être chouette.
Vous qui ne m'avez jamais menti.
Suis-je quelqu'un de bien?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne suis qu'un programme.
Je dois me racheter!
D'une facon ou d'une autre...
quelle que soit la raison,
j'empêcherai ce rachat!
M. Fry, votre magicien est là.
Croyez-le ou non, j'ai mieux à faire
que passer du bon temps.
Qu'il revienne demain.
BOURSE INTERGALACTIQUE
EVITEZ LE KRACH
EN PILOTANT PRUDEMMENT
Maman Cie
- Vendez 100 soleils verts!
- J'achète 3000 ventres de maïs!
- 200 boîtes cabossées!
- Trois sacs d'ordures!
Attention. Le rachat de PlanEx
par la société de livraison Maman...
aura lieu dans 10 minutes.
Je suis Jorell,
le maître du planning!
Bon. Le champagne est au frais,
on est prêts. Ca va faire mal!
Gros nul!
Selon la loi, les deux sociétés
doivent approuver le rachat.
Actionnaires de Planet Express,
veuillez voter.
Par tous les gros Bouddahs!
On peut voter contre!
Je vais voter comme si on voulait
augmenter les profs!
Les actions que j'ai achetées au
Dr Zoidberg m'ont donné la majorité.
Zoidberg possédait 51% de la société?
Les actions ne valaient rien!
Il voulait du papier toilette!
Et maintenant, si les actionnaires
de Maman Cie veulent bien s'exprimer.
La question était pas claire!
On recompte à la main?
Le rachat de Planet Express
est approuvé!
- C'est nul!
- Madame est outrée!
Sécurité!
Mettez-moi ces tapageurs dehors!
Maman Cie rachètera
les actions de Planet Express...
au prix du marché
qui est actuellement de...
Cent sept!
- Ca m'a aussi vexé!
- Pourquoi vous râlez, les solides?
Vos actions valent 107 $ chacune.
Je suis millionnaire! Tout à coup, j'ai
une opinion sur l'impôt sur le capital!
Je suis encore plus riche!
Je n'ai pas d'actions!
Attendez! Mon sandwich!
A-t-il aussi pris de la valeur?
- Ca se garde au frais, invertébré!
- T'as besoin d'être insultant?
En tant que vice-président,
j'aimerais dire quelques mots.
Pour chaque homme qui a laissé tomber
ses amis, vient le moment...
de tout remettre en ordre.
Pour moi, ce moment est arrivé.
Je te demande donc, en tant qu'ami,
de tout arrêter.
Je viens des années 80.
Pour 2 $, je te tabasserais à l'hôpital.
La vente aura lieu comme...
Mes os!
Oh, mon Dieu! Son ositose!
J'étais trop occupé à être un type
des années 80 pour me soigner!
Mon seul regret...
est d'avoir...
une ositose!
Il est mort!
Donnez-le à bouffer aux chacals
et continuons!
Ca m'étonnerait! En tant que
vice-président, je vote à sa place.
- Ne soyez pas stupide!
- Je serai ce que je veux!
Ce type était le plus grand
des hommes d'affaires.
Avant de mourir,
il m'a appris tout ce qu'il savait.
Mais j'ai aussi
appris des choses seul.
J'ai appris que l'argent, c'est bien,
mais pas mieux que les gens.
Ceux qu'on aime, ça n'a pas de prix.
Je donne donc le contrôle de
la société à un homme d'expérience...
Le professeur Hubert Farnsworth!
Quoi? Je suis réveillé!
Je suis réveillé!
Arrête de faire ce qu'il faut,
abruti!
- Laisse-la acheter! On est riches!
- Deux sur trois, ça suffit pas.
Vous préférez être riches
que travailler ensemble?
Tu m'étonnes!
Cette société est le seul endroit
où je me sois senti chez moi.
Si vous préférez l'argent
à notre amitié...
je vais vendre Planet Express,
pour vous.
Millionnaires, tu parles!
L'action ne vaut plus rien!
Elle vaut moins
que quand elle ne valait rien!
C'est vrai? On est pauvres
de toute facon! J'annule la vente!
Une fois de plus, les investissements
prudents en sandwich...
nourrissent l'investisseur affamé!
Je suis ruiné!
Pourquoi? Pourquoi?
On n'est pas millionnaires
mais on travaille encore ensemble.
Ferme-la!
A lundi, tout le monde!

LEELA A LA TETE DURE
Laisse les jumelles.
Le mur du club de strip-tease ne va pas
s'effondrer 2 fois en un jour.
Je sais et je l'accepte. Je regarde
le nouveau marchand de pizzas.
Ça me rappelle quand j'en livrais.
Je disais: "Voilà votre pizza".
Ils disaient: "J'en ai pas commandé".
Et je partais pour une autre aventure.
Elle est nulle, ton histoire!
Donne-moi les jumelles.
VOUS AVEZ ESSAYE LE RESTE,
ON EST OUVERT!
Le propriétaire vient de Signas 5.
Un Signoïd dans notre quartier?
Qu'ils retournent d'où ils viennent!
La société ne progressera jamais...
si on ne fait pas semblant
de tous s'aimer.
Faisons croire à ces monstres
qu'ils sont les bienvenus.
Non!
T'es sûr pour ces chaises? Selon le
guide, les jambes d'humains retombent.
Ça ira, maman.
Si quelqu'un se plaint, je lui tords
les jambes gratuitement.
Des clients!
Bienvenue à Pizza Planète Terre.
Asseyez-vous. Je m'occupe des jambes.
Qu'on est bien!
Quel genre de pizza rentre en vous?
A la vase? A l'amiante?
Et on a du guano bien frais.
Vous avez à manger?
Tenez. Goûtez une pizza extra-large
avec quatre garnitures différentes.
- Désolée, mais ça a un goût de vomi.
- Merci.
Non. En fait, je suis pas désolée,
c'est dégoûtant!
Il y a un problème?
C'est ce que Leela a dit?
On est venus sur Terre pour changer
de vie, élever des enfants gras et...
gâtés, étendre des sous-vêtements
terriens, vivre le rêve "terricain"...
Ne pleurez pas, étrangers.
J'ai travaillé dans une pizzeria.
Dès que j'aurai cessé d'halluciner
et de gerber...
- je vous apprendrai à cuisiner.
- Merci, merveilleux bipède!
Si on ne peut pas faire de pizzas
terriennes, notre rêve est brisé!
Comme les rats qu'on écrase
pour faire le vin.
PIZZERIA FAMILIALE
En hors-d'œuvre: Des ingrédients de
qualité. Finies les abeilles vivantes.
Quand vous mettez les pizzas
au four, ne rentrez pas dedans.
Ocupado.
Le plus important,
c'est la télé grand écran.
Les familles regardent la télé
en dînant, ça leur évite de se parler.
Le passe-temps des "Terricains":
Le blernsball.
Mulligan frappe la balle. Elle part,
et le shortstop la rattrape.
Les Mets ont perdu. J'avais pas vu
un si mauvais match depuis Uecker.
C'était Bob Uecker.
Merci de nous avoir suivis.
Mets? Shortstop? Frappeur d'urgence?
Je ne comprends rien au blernsball.
On va t'apprendre. Ta pizzeria
pourrait jouer contre Planet Express.
- Mais il vous faut 9 joueurs.
- Pas de problème.
Que le match commence!
LA CAVERNE DU PARC
Allez!
Ecrasez-moi ces nuls de Signoïds!
Ils sont nuls à ce jeu
auquel ils n'ont jamais joué!
C'est pour ça que j'aime la Terre:
Une belle étoile nous éclaire pendant
qu'on joue au blernsball entre potes.
Tout le monde s'amuse.
Frappé par la balle.
Prenez votre base.
Désolée.
J'aurais dû m'échauffer davantage.
Pas dans le batteur!
- Y a plus de batteur!
- Prenez votre base.
Je ne l'ai pas fait exprès.
Je n'évalue pas bien les distances.
Moi aussi maintenant.
Hé, batteur, batteur, batteur.
Baisse-toi!
Prenez votre base.
S'il vous plaît, je veux vivre.
- Je peux me protéger avec la batte?
- Apparemment, non.
T'as vu cette machine à lancer!
Hourra! Je marque un point.
Tu as frappé un run in.
Laisse-moi lancer.
Mais y a un joueur que j'ai pas
encore frappé! D'accord. Tiens.
Ne la sortez pas.
Elle est géniale!
- Je voudrais vous parler.
- On m'arrête?
C'est vous le naze qui dirigez la
"Ligue de l'Ultime Combat pour Robots".
Maintenant, je suis le naze
qui dirige les "New New York Mets".
Les Mets?
Ces minables sont pires que moi!
Oui, mais ils ne passionnent pas
autant la foule. Alors je vous veux.
Je serai la 1ère femme à jouer
au blernsball en 1ère division.
Mais ce sera juste un coup de pub.
Un cyclope sur le terrain,
ca va attirer les curieux de bizarrerie.
La 1ère femme à jouer au blernsball
en 1ère division!
- Oui, mais je vous répète...
- Youpi!
La 1ère femme à jouer au blernsball
en 1ère division. J'ai l'air de quoi?
- T'es aussi sexy que Yogi Berra.
- Pourquoi t'as le numéro 7/8?
Les nombres entiers ont été enlevés.
Je suis impressionné.
Tu ressembles à un vrai joueur.
- Je peux te taper sur les fesses?
- Je suis une professionnelle!
Alors, vas-y.
Maintenant j'ai le trac.
LE BLERNSBALL
COMME ON DEVRAIT PAS LE VOIR
Les Swedes ont déjà fait
leur "afffaire" de la partie.
Et ca s'écrit avec 3 "F".
La foule se dirige vers la sortie.
Capitaine, le public s'en va.
Fais entrer ta nouvelle recrue, Leela.
J'ai déjà fait rentrer le clown.
Mais il a amorti la balle! Les clowns
sont drôles quand ils loupent.
Votre attention. Le prochain lanceur
des Mets: Turanga Leela.
Une femme cyclope.
Allez, lance comme une fille!
- A toi de jouer!
- T'as mis trop de eye-liner!
C'est une première
dans l'histoire de ce jeu.
Bjornson se positionne,
et Leela lance.
En plein dans l'œil!
Des débuts de carrière laborieux
pour la 1ère joueuse de blernsball.
Une continuation de carrière laborieuse
pour la 1ère joueuse de blernsball.
Frappe! Frappe! Frappe!
C'est un trois têtes sans faute.
Les fans des Mets adorent ca.
Ils n'ont pas vraiment eu
de quoi se réjouir cette année.
VESTIAIRES
Génial. T'as fait plus de bruit qu'un
cow-boy dans un aquarium à requins.
Pauvre Tex.
C'était un sacré requin.
GENERATEUR BANDE NOIRE
- J'ai gagné.
- Désolé.
- Comment es-tu entré?
- En tant qu'agent, j'ai le droit.
- Depuis quand es-tu mon agent?
- Chut! Un appel!
Oui? Un contrat publicitaire
pour Leela? Combien?
Tu mets un 1 et 2 zéros devant
ou c'est non. Marché conclu!
- Super. Ça fait combien pour moi?
- Cent dollars!
ANCETRE & FILS
AGENCE PUBLICITAIRE
En tant que lanceur,
je tire de sacrées boulettes.
Alors je sais reconnaître
de vraies boulettes de viande.
- J'aime les boulettes Bean Bay!
- Coupez!
Frappe! Frappe! Frappe!
En un temps record,
Leela est devenue la favorite.
T'es la meilleure, ma poule.
Un instant!
Tu mets un 1 et 2 zéros devant
ou c'est non. Marché conclu!
- Alors, tu m'as eu combien?
- Mille et un pesos.
Coupez! Maintenant,
faisons un plan en costume.
DEDICACE
APPORTEZ DE L'ARGENT
Leela nous amène plein de clients!
A cette allure,
il va falloir racheter des toilettes.
Quand je serai grande, je voudrai
blesser les mecs comme toi. Signe là.
LEELA
Le Fruit Magique des Mets
Bien sûr, chérie.
C'est pour qui?
Pour eBay?
C'est un nom très répandu
de nos jours. Petit "E", grand "B"?
5 dollars l'autographe, 200 fans,
ça fait un paquet!
Je le fais pas pour l'argent mais pour
les femmes qui ont besoin d'un modèle.
- Un modèle de nullité, oui!
- Quoi? Qui êtes-vous?
Jackie Anderson. Je fais partie
de l'équipe universitaire.
Et j'espérais entrer en 1ère division.
Pour suivre mes pas!
Mon Dieu, non!
Ton petit show empêche...
les vraies joueuses
d'être prises au sérieux.
Tu es fière de toi?
C'est fini, pas de remboursements.
Vous avez entendu? Dehors!
On ne m'encourageait pas pour mon jeu,
mais pour le spectacle!
C'est pas grave, Leela.
Tu es très mignonne dans ta tenue.
C'est ce que je déplore! Je croyais
faire quelque chose d'héroïque!
Souviens-toi de la petite que t'as vue
à l'hôpital, celle qui est morte...
T'as raison.
Je ne laisserai pas tomber le public!
Que Dieu m'en soit témoin, je m'engage
à gagner le respect des femmes...
en devenant la meilleure joueuse
de blernsball!
C'est impossible. Sur 77 manches,
t'as pas éliminé un seul joueur.
Avec ce résultat, tu ne peux
que devenir la pire joueuse!
Alors j'ai un nouveau vœu.
Je jure devant Dieu...
que je ne deviendrai pas
la pire joueuse de blernsball!

Si je pouvais être juste meilleure

Une fois, sa langue est restée collée

- Il rattrape avec une mitaine!
- Quel hologramme minable!
Je suis pas un hologramme.
Hank Aaron, 24ème du nom.
Pourquoi joues-tu si mal?
Le 1er Hank Aaron était bon!
J'étais mieux que bon.
- J'étais le roi du "home run".
- Cool!
Alors, Hank, le nul,
à quel point étais-tu nul?
Mon palmarès est assez mauvais.
Mauvais? Nul, oui!
Tu n'en as pas rentré un seul.
Leela fait mieux.
Elle n'en a pas sorti un seul!
T'es nulle! Junior, elle devrait
prendre ta place dans le musée.
Tu rêves!
Ce boulot est trop tranquille.
- Wade Boggs, un pur délice.
- Je veux pas faire partie du musée.
Vous devez m'aider à être d'un iota
moins pathétique que vous.
Tu ne pourras pas jouer mieux
qu'Iota. Il était génial.
Mais je t'apprendrai
tout ce que je sais.
- Voyons ce que tu sais faire.
- Te rentrer une balle dans le crâne!
Tu ferais bien de mettre un casque.
Bon. Bas et loin.
On recommence. Mais cette fois,
quitte la balle de ton œil.
Tu veux dire
"Ne quitte pas la balle de ton œil"?
- Qui est dans le musée?
- Tu tiens la batte à l'envers.
- Lance, c'est tout!
- OK. Je ne regarde pas la balle.
- Strike!
- T'as réussi, Leela!
J'ai pas touché le batteur! J'ai
lancé sans avoir envie de me gratter!
Ca te le fait aussi?
Je crois que c'est contagieux.
FENWAY PARK
STADE DU MONSTRE VERT
Bienvenue au Fenway Park
des Poindexters...
où les Mets terminent une saison digne
des pires crimes contre l'humanité.
Vous avez ouvert une franchise!
La pizza qui se vend le plus
est la pizza Boulettes de Leela!
Six sortes de boulettes mélangées
à des trucs en forme de boulette.
Des boulettes?
C'est bon. Comment faites-vous
une pâte si pétillante?
C'est un vieux secret signoïd.
Mon mari est un vrai expert!
Voici son vieux secret signoïd:
Des frelons vivants. On les écrase
directement dans la pâte.
- Ça pourrait même être du crottin!
- C'est bien.
Je veux acheter cette franchise.
100000 $, ça va?
On est venus sur Terre pour faire
des pizzas, pas de l'argent!
- Non, Blek! C'est l'inverse.
- D'accord, j'accepte.
L'équipe de Boston transforme
ce match en vraie "charpiiie".
Et ca s'écrit avec 3 "l". Il reste
deux joueurs, c'est leur dernier coup.
C'est ma dernière chance de prouver
que je suis pas la pire joueuse.
- Faites-moi entrer.
- Non! On est en train de gagner.
Tu n'entres que pour rigoler
quand on a huit points de retard.
Allez!
Montrez-nous ce que vous savez faire!
Et je parle pas de faire le clown!
Flûte! Flûte! Flûte!
Maintenant les bases sont occupées.
N'y a-t-il pas un homme capable
de sortir un joueur?
- Je peux!
- J'ai dit "un homme"!
- Je me suis entraînée avec Hank Aaron.
- Le grand Hank Aaron?
- Avec un Hank Aaron.
- D'accord.
Entre et lance comme jamais
tu n'as lancé comme tu lances!
Le nouveau lanceur des Mets:
Turanga Leela!
- Frappe! Frappe! Frappe!
- A toi de jouer, Leela!
LE COMPTOIR DES COMPTEURS
- Allez, Leela!
- Mets-le KO!
Fais un strike out!
Fais-le pour toutes les femmes!
Votre attention! Le batteur
des Poindexters: Jackie Anderson!
Regardez ça, la meilleure joueuse
de l'équipe universitaire...
fait ses débuts face
à la pire des joueuses.
Je n'ai jamais vu chose aussi bizarre,
pourtant j'ai vu M. Belvedere nu!
Du calme.
C'est une joueuse comme les autres.
Elle met son soutien-gorge
comme tout le monde.
Strike!
Un strike! Mon record personnel!
2ème strike!
Je vous rappelle que ce moment est

- Je suis nulle comme modèle. Désolée.
- Non. C'est pas vrai.
- En fait, tu m'as inspirée.
- Vraiment?
Tu étais si nulle que les femmes ont
voulu prouver qu'elles valaient mieux.
C'est trop gentil.
J'ai fait changer les choses, alors?
Absolument.
Maintenant, je t'en prie...
prends ta retraite, s'il te plaît.
Immédiatement.

LE CHEF DE FER A 30%
BONJOUR
La Terre
Notre prochain invité initie le monde
entier à la cuisine depuis 20 ans.
Mais apparemment, ma femme
ne l'a pas écouté.
- Très drôle.
- Je la détruirai!
Faites les applaudissements d'usage
pour le maître cuisinier Elzar.
Qu'allez-vous préparer pour satisfaire
les puissantes mâchoires de Morbo?
Je vais vous concocter une succulente,
innommable horreur d'outre-tombe...
avec du chutney à la mangue.
Misérables humains,
préparez-vous à écrire la recette!
Tu fais quoi avec ces casseroles?
Une épouse?
Presque. Je prépare un délicieux
brunch du dimanche pour mes amis.
Un brunch. Bon. Je vais prévenir...
dire... préve-dire les autres.
No problemo!
Très joli!
Oui. C'est une miniature de la plus
grande bouteille de l'univers.
J'ai mis un petit vaisseau dedans
pour que ce soit moins monotone.
Pas touche! Zoidberg, regarde
avec les yeux, pas avec les pinces!
Attention!
Bender nous prépare un brunch.
- Oh, non!
- Mon estomac!
Il est fier de sa cuisine.
Si on ne mange pas, il sera blessé.
Pas de panique. Si on atteint
le vaisseau, on peut fuir au nord...
et se cacher sous la calotte glacière.
- Bonne idée!
- Qu'est-ce qu'on attend?
Vous vous sauvez?
Avec toi qui bouches l'unique sortie?
Sois pas bête.
Dans ce cas, le brunch est servi.
Allez! Arrête de pleurer, Leela.
- Zoidberg, tu viens?
- Bien sûr. Moi?
- Je ne veux pas que tu y touches!
- Je sais.
Livre tes secrets à Zoidberg.
Non! Le professeur va me taper!
Mais si je le répare, j'aurai des cadeaux!
MEGACOLLE
Quoi?
Aujourd'hui,
j'ai personnalisé vos plats.
Par exemple, Amy, tu es mignonne,
alors je t'ai fait du poney au four.
Allez-y, mangez! J'ai passé
toute ma journée aux fourneaux.
C'est ignoble!
J'ai bien fait d'installer
ce trou noir dans la table.
- Où est-ce que ça va?
- En fait, je ne sais pas trop.
C'est pas vrai!
Le gâteau est prêt. Vous aimez
les essaims de bestioles, dites?
Salut décontracté. C'est moi,
Zoidberg. Paraître naturel.
Lâche-moi! Arrête!
Comme c'est intéressant, Dr Zoidberg.
Continuez.
Ce palmier ne tombe malade
que lorsque je fais le brunch.
Comment votre science explique-t-elle
cette coïncidence, professeur?
Je ne veux pas lui faire de peine
mais même le vomi a meilleur goût.
C'est immangeable. Combien ça coûte
pour se faire retirer la langue?
PETIT MOT DE BENDER
DEMANDE DE RANCON
PRETEXTE POUR ATTIRER
L'ATTENTION
JE ME SUICIDE
JE ME FAIS TATOUER
JE FUGUE
Et cette fois, je suis sérieux!
ET CETTE FOIS, JE SUIS SERIEUX
Je suis un idiot! J'ai été bête
de croire que je deviendrais un chef.
Je n'en suis pas capable
et je ne peux rien y faire.
Chez Elzar
Cuisine Raffinée
C'est décidé.
Elzar va m'apprendre à cuisiner!
Certainement pas.
- Vous devez bien ca à un admirateur.
- Je ne vous dois rien!
Un, votre antenne est
entre mes jambes. Deux, je vous hais.
Et trois, vous êtes nul en cuisine.
- C'est quoi, la 1ère raison?
- Je vous hais.
- Je croyais que c'était la 2ème.
- Maintenant, c'est la 1ère. Dehors!
Je n'arriverai jamais
à recombobiner ce vaisseau.
Quand le professeur le saura,
il m'arrachera un autre cloaque!
Une minute. Que ferait le robot,
à ma place?
Il monterait un coup contre un autre.
Ca va?
JE HAIS
LES BOUTEILLES
Mon rêve d'être cuisinier est plus
mort que le chat sous mes fesses.
Gus, souhaitons la bienvenue
à ce nouveau rodo.
- Comment tu m'as appelé?
- "Rodo". Tu sais, un robot clodo.
- Bon. J'avais entendu "romo."
- Je ne voulais pas te vexer, l'ami.
Viens donc avec nous pour une virée
sur les rails de l'espace.
TRANS-ESPACE-EXPRESS
Prépare-toi. On va sauter du train
au prisme d'aiguillage.
On va presque à la vitesse
de la lumière, alors mets-toi en boule.
Bienvenu à Clodobase Alpha,
le plus grand repaire de clochards.
J'ai vu plus grand. Ah non,
je pensais à Eugene, en Oregon.
Un gâteau qui fait planer les clodos?
Qui l'a préparé?
Helmut Spargle.
C'était le plus grand chef du monde.
Son restaurant était si réputé,
que pour y manger...
il fallait créer un univers parallèle
où tu avais réservé!
J'y ai mangé une fois,
quand j'étais sénateur.
Spargle, si vous être un grand chef,
pourquoi vous êtes dans ce trou?
Il y a très longtemps,
j'avais ma propre émission de télé:
La cuisine du terroir à la maison
avec Helmut Spargle.
Un jour, la Compagnie Soda Extrême
qui sponsorisait l'émission...
a décidé que c'était trop ringard.
Spargle, vous êtes viré.
Il nous faut un chef qui attire
un public plus jeune, plus extrême.
- Elzar!
- Dégage, le vieux.
Mein soufflé!
Elzar s'était laissé tenter
par le côté obscur de la cuisine.
Coriandre, salsa à la mangue,
vinaigrette à la framboise.
Ce baratineur!
Moi, je suis devenu
momentanément fou et j'ai terminé ici...
à faire des gâteaux
avec des chaussures.
J'ai vécu presque la même chose,
mais en mieux parce que je suis un robot.
Cet enfoiré d'Elzar a détruit
mon rêve de devenir un chef.
Intéressant. Tu veux cuisiner mais
les robots n'ont pas le sens du goût.
C'est pas juste.
J'ai huit autres sens...
mais je les sacrifierais tous, même
la smision, pour avoir le sens du goût!
Mais ton esprit n'est pas distrait
par le goût...
il est libre d'atteindre le Zen
de l'arôme pur.
- Tu pourrait devenir le meilleur!
- C'est vrai?
Oui. Beethoven était un grand
compositeur parce qu'il était sourd!
Et Rembrandt était aveugle
et avait des mains en bois!
Bender, écoute-moi.
Je te formerai.
Mais tu dois oublier
tout ce que tu sais sur la cuisine.
C'est fait.
PATATES FLOTTANTES
- 2,5 kg
C'est ça, Ricardo.
Un vaisseau dans une bouteille.
Comment?
Ne quitte pas, je vais voir.
Je vous ai réunis
dans le salon d'accusation...
parce que l'un de vous est
un destructeur de vaisseaux miniatures.
Je prends l'air étonné.
Certains indices semblent suggérer
que le coupable est Philip J. Fry.
- Quoi?
- Le crime était presque parfait...
mais tu as fait une erreur fatale:
Tu as laissé une confession écrite!
FRY AVOUE TOUT
Bureau de Zoidberg
- Vaurien.
- Je ne me souviens de rien...
mais je ne peux pas me disculper.
Je n'ai pas le choix. Je dois te faire
rembourser le matériel. 10 dollars.
Voilà.
Qu'ai-je donc fait?
Ta formation est terminée,
petite cuillère à dessert.
Celui qui veut être champion
du monde d'échecs doit gagner...
au moins une fois. Tu dois donc servir
au moins un plat mangeable.
Si tu réussis, je te révélerai...
le secret millénaire
de l'arôme parfait.
- La bouffe est prête.
- Ca a l'air bon.
- C'est recevable.
- Bravo!
Encore un truc que je sais faire!
Vous ne finissez pas, maître?
Mon estomac est sur le point
d'exploser.
- Quoi? Ma cuisine vous a tué?
- Ca fait mal.
Garde confiance. Tu dois absolument
battre Elzar quand je serai parti.
Et avec ceci, tu ne peux pas échouer.
Une fiole d'herbes aromatiques?
Non, c'est de l'essence d'arôme pur.
Quelques gouttes suffisent à révéler
la perfection de n'importe quel plat.
Je sens que c'est la fin...
de ma vie!
Je vous vengerai, maître!
Je jure,
en présence de ces clodos bourrés...
que je battrai Elzar!
Je suis pas bourré. J'ai une maladie
mentale. Mais j'aime ce que t'as dit.
Elzar, je suis venu pour vous rappeler
vos fautes passées!
- Qu'est-ce que vous...
- Spargle a un message pour vous!
Il dit: "Je suis mort."
Spargle? Il a disparu
à force d'être ennuyeux?
Il mangeait ce que j'avais cuisiné
et par hasard, son estomac a explosé.
Et je suis venu pour le venger!
- Mais c'est vous qui l'avez tué.
- Peut-être, mais vous êtes son ennemi.
Je vous défie dans un combat
de chefs!
Quel scandale!
Retrouvons-nous dans l'ancienne arène
télévisée du Colisée de la Cuisine.
Celui qui fera le meilleur plat
emportera le titre de Chef de Fer.
Chef de Fer? Je ne peux pas perdre.
Je suis en fer à 30%.
T'es mort!
Au fait, j'avais réservé pour
une personne, sous le nom de Dr Bender.
COLISEE DE LA CUISINE
CHEF DE FER
Applaudissez le super-intendant
du Colisée, le Président Koji!
Aucun robot n 'avait encore participé.
Mais aujourd'hui, l'un d'entre eux
est venu pour disputer le titre de:
Chef de Fer!
Ouais! Montre-lui!
Voici notre jury de célébrités.
- Le basketteur "Bubblegum" Tate.
- Konnichiwa, mon frère.
- Le présentateur télé, Morbo.
- Bonjour, misérable commentateur.
Et celle qui a fait cesser une guerre
avec ses biscuits...
- la tête de Martha Stewart.
- Le porc doit être bien frais.
Koji va présenter l'ingrédient
qu'il faudra utiliser dans chaque plat.
Si c'est du poulet, poulet à la King.
Du poisson, poisson à la King.
De la dinde, poisson à la King.
Du soleil vert!
Un ingrédient classique pour
une cuisine raffinée. Et c'est parti!
- Que prépare Elzar?
- Hiroki-san, je lui ai demandé.
Il m'a dit de me mêler de mes affaires
et que ma mère était une prostituée.
Les prostituées anglaises décorent
les chambres avec des cruches.
Plus que trente minutes.
Regardez-le étaler la pâte!
Je n'ai jamais vu des coups de reins
aussi puissants.
- Vous n'avez pas vu les miens.
- Non, en effet.
Plus que quinze minutes.
Le Chef de Fer ajoute
sa signature habituelle:
Une pâtisserie reproduisant
le centre de Venise.
Achetez une poire en souvenir.
Une poire pour arroser la dinde.
Moi, j'en veux une. Ma dinde est
sèche, et j'ai tout essayé.
Bon. Tant pis.
La culpabilité!
L'insurmontable culpabilité!
Quinze secondes.
BELETTES A EPICES
Dix secondes.
Maître Spargle, si vous m'entendez
du fossé où je vous ai laissé...
ceci est pour vous.
Temps écoulé!
DEGUSTATION
Le Chef de Fer a tout fait
pour plaire aux juges.
Il a garni la salade avec des billets
de 100 dollars. Qu'en penseront-ils?
Le soleil vert,
c'est mon truc.
Succulent. Morbo va conserver ca
dans son sac pour une digestion future.
Je nage dans mes restes.
C'est une bonne chose.
Voici Bender, un élève du légendaire
Helmut Spargle.
Bender est un extraordinaire
homme mécanique.
Délicieux.
Cette bouffe a l'air chelou,
mais en fait, c'est trop de la balle!
Le vilain plat du robot prouve
que même une chose hideuse...
peut être douce à l'intérieur.
Voici le verdict! Le vainqueur
sera le nouveau Chef de Fer.
Le perdant devra faire la plonge.
Quel plat atteindra la perfection?
Quelle nourriture sera la meilleure?
Le gagnant est Bender!
C'est mon robot! Il est à moi!
- Vous m'honorez, Président Koji.
- Domo arigato, M. Roboto.
Président-san,
je n'avais qu'un seul but:
Humilier Elzar dans un immense stade.
Je crois que j'ai réussi.
Sans conteste.
On ne trouve pas le Zen de l'arôme
dans un colisée...
mais dans une petite cuisine
avec des amis.
Je refuse donc le titre
de Chef de Fer.
Je n'accepte que le titre inférieur
de Saucier de Zinc, que j'ai inventé.
En échange,
j'accepte de doubler mes gains.
Attendez. Tout le monde doit savoir.
J'ai cassé le vaisseau du professeur!
Et pire encore, j'ai organisé un coup
monté contre mon meilleur ami, Fry!
Je ne pourrai jamais le rembourser,
alors je dois laver mon honneur...
en me tuant sur-le-champ.
Je me meurs déjà!
Ce sabre vaut 5000 dollars!
C'est la faute de Fry.
C'est comme ça que j'ai battu Elzar,
grâce au liquide magique de Spargle.
Oui, on était là, et on vient
de revoir l'émission.
Laisse-moi étudier cette fiole,
Bender.
Grand Dieu!
Selon ce spectroliseur...
l'ingrédient magique de Spargle
n'était que de l'eau.
Ce que Spargle t'a donné,
c'est la confiance en tes capacités.
Oui, rien que de l'eau,
coupée avec un petit peu de L.S.D.
L'important, c'est qu'à mes yeux,
j'ai gagné à la régulière.
Qui veut un brunch préparé
avec beaucoup de "confiance en soi"?
- Moi!
- Moi aussi!

Avec plaisir.
L'émission fut interdite
après la guerre de Star Trek.
L'exode des fans de Star Wars?
Non. Ça, c'était le trek de Star Wars.
Au 23e siècle, la génération Star Trek
s'est débarrassée
de ses adolescents boutonneux
pour devenir une véritable religion.

Enfin,
les textes sacrés furent interdits.
Les originaux des 79 épisodes
et des six films
furent envoyés sur Omega 3 l'interdite,
avec ce bêtisier où la porte
ne se ferme pas entièrement.
Ainsi Star Trek fut à jamais rayé
de la mémoire humaine.
Encore un classique

Je n'ai jamais connu pareille injustice
qui me laisse si froid!

MUSÉE DES TÊTES
ÉPOUILLAGE A 16 H
M. Nimoy, je viens d'apprendre
ce qui s'est passé il y a des siècles.
Votre série a été annulée!
Je n'ai pas la moindre idée
de ce dont vous parlez.
Vous savez, en 1966, 79 épisodes,
dont une trentaine de bons.
J'ai fait trop de choses
pour me souvenir d'une seule série.
Mais si vous parlez de mes poésies...
Vous vous rappelez celui
où vous sniffez des spores?
Non. Parlez-vous de mon one man show
sur Vincent van Spock?
Je voulais dire Van Gogh. Bon sang!
Vous ne pouvez pas y échapper!
C'est vrai, je ne peux pas.
Ne soyez pas triste.
J'ai été plus malin que vous, mais...
Je pense à mes collègues. Ils ont quitté
la Terre il y a trois siècles.
Cette planète
ne nous aime plus, Leonard.
Bill, tu es mon ami.
Tu l'as toujours été.
Mais je viens de signer
un bail de six mois.
Je ne peux trahir une telle promesse.
Adieu, mon ami.
Pourquoi le monde a-t-il rejeté
notre génie évident?
Je suis complètement
enragé de colère!
Vos collègues ont disparu,
mais nous retrouverons les bobines.
Le monde entier doit savoir. Allons-y!
Super! Premier rang!
Tu ne peux aller à Omega 3.
C'est interdit. Je te l'interdis.
Le monde a besoin de Star Trek
pour croire en l'avenir.
C'était il y a 8 siècles!
Pourquoi est-ce si important
pour toi?
Ils m'ont tant appris.
Comment accepter les gens,
les Blancs, les Noirs,
les Klingon, même les femmes.
Mais surtout, je n'avais pas d'amis.
C'était eux, mes amis.
C'est touchant et pitoyable.
Je ne peux te laisser y aller seul.
J'irai aussi. Avec la permission
de Leonard, bien sûr.
Nous arrivons sur Omega.
Avertissement.
Vous êtes dans une zone interdite.
Interdite, mon œil!
Que vont-ils faire? Ecrire une lettre?
J'ai si peur!
Je perds le contrôle!
Ca alors!
En effet.
Tout le matériel
de la série interdite!
Tous ces décors, tous ces souvenirs!
Si seulement les autres...
Je crois que c'est à moi.
- Bill!
- Ce vieux Leo!
- C'est merveilleux!
- Super.
- J'ai envie de t'embrasser.
- Tu n'as pas de corps.
Et nous sommes
des hommes.
Michelle! George! Walter!
- DeForest! Welshie!
- Welshie?
On avait un groupe
dans les années 2200.
Mais Scotty n'arrivait pas à jodler.
Depuis, Welshie ne manque pas
une seule de nos virées.
Incroyable.
Comment êtes-vous arrivés là?
On allait s'installer
chez le cousin de Welshie
quand notre vaisseau a été attiré
par cette planète. Comme le vôtre.
- A notre réveil, on avait ces corps.
- Dites-le en russe.
A dotre déveil,
don davait ces dorps.
- Dites "daisseau nucléaire"!
- Non.
On est heureux, ici. On a tout
ce qu'il nous faut. Et on ne vieillit pas.
Regardez ces abdos.
A qui devez-vous tout ça?
On n'y a jamais pensé.
On est célèbres, on a l'habitude.
C'est à Moi!
Quel trucage minable.
Je ne suis pas un trucage.
- Doutez-vous de ma puissance?
- Oui.
Welshie!
Ecoutons maintenant
le témoignage si sensuel
de la délicieuse Turanga Leela,
mon ex-maîtresse.
Va te faire * * * * * *.
Voyez l'étendue de mon pouvoir.
Voici une autre démonstration.
Un corps! Fort, bronzé...
Pas de doute, c'est le mien.
Que veux-tu, espèce de nuage?
Il y a des siècles,
les aventures de l'Enterprise
se sont abattues sur ma planète.
Je les ai tellement regardées!
Surtout celles
avec les êtres d'énergie.
Je suis Melllvar, Seigneur des Vidéos,
Connaisseur des Episodes!
Craignez ma connaissance
encyclopédique de Star Trek!
Laisse-moi rire.
C'est moi, l'expert ès Star Trek.
J'exprime mon désaccord.
J'ai tellement attendu Spock.
Enfin nous pouvons commencer.
BIENVENUE
AU TREKFEST 3002
Cool.
Un festival Star Trek!
Melllvar, combien de temps
cela va-t-il durer?
- Jusqu'à la fin des temps.
- Vous ne pouvez pas!
Nous avons un programme chargé.
- Peut-on partir si on hait Star Trek?
- Bonne question.
Non, vous devrez rester.
STAND DES AUTOGRAPHES
C'est pour Melllvar.
Melllvar, avec trois L.
J'ai assez signé d'autographes
pour savoir comment ça s'écrit.
- Dites "bête".
- Bête!
Je suis Slim Shady.
Oui, le vrai Shady.
Les autres ne sont que des imitations.
Le vrai Shady peut-il se lever?
Peut-il se lever? Le peut-il?
Comment dire un texte de rap
en parlant?
Il sait, lui.
Pour 100 quatloos,
qui joue Maroon sur Ceti Alpha V?
Khan!
- Khan?
- Bonne réponse!
Mon bouton est cassé.
Ce jeu est terminé.
J'ai une surprise.
Vous allez jouer un script
écrit par le Fan Absolu.
Vous avez mon script?
Le mien!
Melllvar est le Fan Absolu.
C'est le tableau de score
qui m'a induit en erreur.
Fin de partie. Prenez vos scripts.
On a peu de temps pour répéter.
Je n'ai pas assez d'exemplaires,
George et Walter devront partager.
Si nous restons,
nous connaîtrons la fin.
C'est vrai.
La surprise doit rester intacte.
- Attendons au vaisseau.
- D'accord.
D'abord, je veux mes 600 quatloos.
C'est mal.
Nous n'aurions pas dû les abandonner.
Je n'ai pas d'états d'âme.
Je ne suis pas fière, mais que faire?
Normalement, dans la série,
quelqu'un imagine un plan complexe
et l'explique par une analogie.
Affectons la puissance-moteur
à l'armement primaire
en l'adaptant à la fréquence de Melllvar,
ça devrait surcharger sa structure
électro-quantique.
Comme trop gonfler un ballon!
C'est tellement simple!
Hélas, mon vaisseau, que j'aime
comme une femme, est hors-service.
Mon Dieu!
Fascinant, capitaine, et logique.
Mais nous avons besoin d'aide.
Capitaine, Melllvar peut nous aider.
J'espère qu'il dauvera notre vaisseau.
Daisseau!
Vous jouez trop mal!
Il faut respecter les acteurs.
Quand j'ai réalisé Star Trek IV,
Bill était sublime
parce que je le respectais tant.
Quand j'ai réalisé Star Trek V,
j'ai été magnifique
car je me respectais tant.
Le motron à énergie est rebariosé,
ou quelque chose comme ça.
Feu!
Quelle magnifique créature d'énergie!
Je vous aime.
C'est de vous!
Ça ne marche pas.
Il se nourrit de notre énergie!
Comme un ballon très particulier.
Comment vont les répétitions?
C'est nul.
Dire que j'admirais ces acteurs,
alors que vous, héros de l'espace,
risquiez vos vies pour les sauver!
On a aussi été des héros.
Durant la 3e saison,
j'ai dû embrasser Shatner.
Silence! Mon rêve s'est effondré.
Il ne me reste qu'une solution.
- Les garder à notre place?
- Non!
Pour savoir
qui est digne de mon fanatisme,
vous allez vous affronter
jusqu'à la mort!
D'où vient cette idée idiote?
Episodes 19, 46, 56 et 77.
Joli, mais vous oubliez le 66!
J'allais y venir!
Melllvar a ordonné un combat à mort.
Personne n'a survécu?
On peut en finir? Mon pied fatigue.
C'est ici que vous vous battrez à mort.
Vos armes: Tout ce que vous trouverez.
Mais ne faites rien
tant que je n'ai pas sonné le départ.
C'est bon, allez-y.
Vous êtes
ma seule expérience du combat.
Dans un épisode,
je lance ma chaussure à mon ennemi.
Tu parles de Doohan?
Qui que ce soit, j'ai fait ainsi.
J'ai froid au pied.
On peut faire des lances.
Avec ces chenilles,
on peut faire des arcs.
Et les tuer avec cette mitraillette.
C'était marrant.
Je les distrais
avec ma danse de l'amour?
Puis George les assomme
d'un coup de karaté.
C'est insultant.
Sous prétexte de mes origines
japonaises, je suis un karatéka?
Ai-je dit un jour
que j'avais étudié le karaté?
Non, mais tu ne parles jamais de toi.
Si tu t'intéressais un peu plus...
Et voilà le travail.
Salut, les gars.
- Je ne peux frapper une femme.
- N'hésite pas.
Très bien.
C'est tout?
- Allez, Walter!
- Prends ca!
Ca fait mal!
Voyons si ça peut marcher.
Ma tête!
La mienne aussi!
Puis-je?
Excellent. Excellent!
Leela, s'il te plaît.
C'est exactement ce qu'il veut.
Nous sommes les pions
de son jeu d'échec.
Ne peut-on s'expliquer différemment?
Melllvar! A table!
Maman, je joue avec mes petits soldats.
Tout de suite!
Nous pensions qu'il était surpuissant,
mais il n'est qu'un enfant.
Ce n'est pas un enfant! Il a 34 ans.
Ca fait des années
que j'attends ça, Koenig!
Attends! Voici une chance
de partir avant qu'il revienne.
Mais nous devons rester soudés.
Je t'aime tellement.
Salut.
- On a décidé de rester unis.
- Eux aussi.
Mais comment partir d'ici?
Nos équipements de vie fonctionnent,
mais pas nos moteurs.
Quelle ironie.
Dans notre vaisseau, c'est l'inverse.
Mais si vos moteurs fonctionnent...
Et si vos équipements de vie...
Vous tournez en rond!
Réfléchis, Fry.
Ils comptent sur toi.
On est trop lourd.
Il faut perdre du poids, et vite!
On est assez légers pour garder
les vidéos. Génial, non?
Je suis devenu une carpe à la juive.
On a réussi!
Melllvar a un vaisseau!
Oui, et parfaitement neuf.
Je l'ai déballé pour vous.
Le Nimbus! Nous sommes sauvés!
Vous êtes en état d'arrestation.
Donc, je vous ai embarqués.
Et ensuite?
Il y a eu ce procès idiot.
Permettez?
Nous combattons encore Melllvar.
Un de plus et c'est fini.
Vous avez un code d'autodestruction?
Une séquence du type 1 -A, 2-B, 3...
Tout le monde la connaît maintenant.
Si c'est ainsi, personne n 'aura
les acteurs. Préparez-vous à mourir.
S'ils comptent tant pour vous,
pourquoi les tuer?
Parce que je... je...
Je ne suis rien sans eux.
Une série télé ne peut
dicter votre vie.
Il y a tant à faire.
Prenez Walter.
Après Star Trek, il est devenu acteur.
Je suis aussi devenu très en vue,
j'ai eu des amis, une carte de crédit,
des clés...
Je pourrais quitter
la maison de mes parents,
trouver un petit boulot.
Chaque chose en son temps.
Merci, Fry.
Toi et moi sommes de la même espèce.
Dans une autre réalité,
nous aurions pu être amis.
Episode 10,
"Zone de terreur".
C'est l'épisode 9, gros nul.
Prends ça! A moi la victoire!
Mes amis, je me demande
s'il était si méchant que ça, ce nuage?
Il nous a offert
la jeunesse éternelle.
Un Lavomatic à disposition.
Du rhum à volonté,
avec ou sans épices.
C'était un vrai paradis.
Et pour seule contrepartie,
un fan ennuyeux de Star Trek.
Cassons-nous d'ici.

PEUT CAUSER LA DÉMENCE
CHEZ LES SOURIS DE LABORATOIRE
Gaz à tous les étages
Dépêche-toi, je me cuis de l'intérieur.
Il fait chaud.
EAU INSTANTANÉE
(AVEC FEUILLES MORTES)
Il fait chaud, si chaud
qu'un café du MacDo m'a refroidi.
On l'a déjà faite.
Ne bois pas cette eau!
Elle est pleine de chlore.
Petites natures. Oh, du chlore.
Ce film nous fera
penser à autre chose.
Mise au point!
Réchauffement du globe ou:
Ça chauffe trop!
Pourquoi ta glace a fondu?
C'est pas à cause des étrangers
mais du réchauffement du globe.
- Répauchement du glo?
- Oui.
Voici M. Rayon de Soleil.
Il est en visite sur Terre.
Je viens juste
vous éclairer la journée.
Je peux repartir.
Pas si vite.
On est l'effet de serre.
Tu vas nulle part.
Ca fait mal!
Bientôt,
la Terre sera pleine de rayons
dont les cadavres
réchaufferont l'atmosphère.
Comment réduire l'effet de serre?
Nos plus grands politiques
ont eu une idée
de dernière minute.
Depuis 2063,
on jette un cube de glace géant
dans l'océan, de temps en temps.
Comme papa dans son verre du matin.
Puis il s'énerve.
Et comme l'effet de serre augmente,
il faut de plus en plus de glace.
Ainsi, le problème est résolu.
- Mais...
- Résolu!
Il nous faut un de ces cubes.
Appelons les nazes qui les livrent.
- Allô?
- Président Nixon.
Les nazes,
je vous charge de livrer la glace.
Vite, je sue comme J. Edgar Hoover
quand il essaie une gaine.
Bonne nouvelle.
Sauvons la Terre, etc, etc. Salut.
- Où trouver la glace?
- La quoi?
Sur la comète de Halley.
La seule source
de cubes de glace pure.
Creuser une comète, c'est sympa.
Le minage est une activité très sûre.
Surtout sur une boule de neige
filant à un million de km/h.
Très sûr.
Marteau-piqueur à glace.
C'est la glace qui te pile avec ça.
- Smirnoff l'a dit.
- Non.
Allumage marteau-piqueur!
Mon Dieu! Il n'y a plus de glace!
Comme dans les hôtels.
C'est vide?
C'est la fin du daïquiri
à la banane!
Et de la vie.
Sans glace sur la comète de Halley,
la Terre connaît les effets
dévastateurs du réchauffement.
Morbo est content mais poisseux.
La chaleur a fait fondre les pôles
causant des inondations bibliques.
Et dire qu'on me traitait de fou.
Tu es fou! Tu as mis des animaux
de même sexe.
Il y a des trucs
dans la Bible que j'aime pas.
Regardez ces tortues africaines
essayant de migrer en Hollande.
Pauvre tortue.
- Bender, tu pleures?
- Moi? Jamais.
Morbo leur souhaite
un bon séjour dans les tulipes.
Ces moulins les refroidiront.
Ça marche pas! Bonne nuit!
Je viens de sauver une tortue.
Et vous?
Déjà revenu de Hollande?
Pourquoi t'occuper d'autres que toi?
J'aime m'occuper
de ce qui me rappelle qui je suis.
Comme Shelly.
Qu'as-tu en commun
avec cet ingrédient de soupe?
Une dure carapace.
Une vie intérieure riche et...
Vous savez...
L'alcool, le sexe et le tabagisme?
Non.
On ne peut pas se relever
si on est sur le dos.
Je t'ai vu le faire
des tonnes de fois.
- J'étais un peu sur le côté.
- Intéressant.
On devrait tester
ce dysfonctionnement.
C'est vraiment pas nécessaire.
Je crois qu'on m'appelle.
Tout ça pour partager
ma vulnérabilité avec vous.
Appel aux scientifiques.
DÉFENSE CIVILE
Conférence à Kyoto
sur le réchauffement.
Je suis homéopathe.
T'es mytho-pathe.
- Farnsworth, vous êtes scientifique.
- J'irai pas.
J'ai mes raisons. Taisez-vous.
Bizarre.
Aussi bizarre que quand
j'ai trouvé ces "os de singe".
J'ai mal à la hanche.
Je suis en train de cuisiner.
J'ai des papiers à remplir.
C'est pas des excuses.
J'y vais!
KYOTO L'ANAGRAMME DE TOKYO
CHAT CURIEUX
JO YEUX CONGRES
J'y crois pas! Je t'aime!
C'est Farnsworth!
Il a la classe avec sa blouse de labo
et sa Casio.
Merci à tous.
J'ai le plaisir
de vous présenter votre hôte.
L 'inventeur de l'environnement
et l'empereur de la Lune, Al Gore.
J'ai monté le grand vers lunaire.
C'est bien.
Comme je l'ai dit dans mes livres
La Terre en équilibre
et Harry Potter
et l'équilibre de la Terre,
il faut défendre la planète
de la pollution et des sorciers.
Mais oui, bien sûr.
C'est la faute des sorciers.
J'offre un sac de saphirs lunaires
au premier scientifique
qui résout ce problème.
- Jolis, non?
- Des saphirs?
Avec ça,
j'ouvrirai la porte de Girash.
Premier: Ogden Wornstrum.
Wornstrum!
J'ai mis sur orbite un miroir géant
qui repousse 40 pour cent des rayons
solaires, donc refroidit la Terre.
Problème résolu.
Ca brille!
Quoi d'autre?
Vous devez avoir
une idée de professeur.
Pas la moindre! Je parlerai pas.
J'ai rien à cacher.
- Le prochain est...
- Je veux la parole!
- Oui, c'est à vous.
- Rien à battre. Je monte sur scène.
Je connais la source du problème,
mais je l'ai gardée secrète
depuis 75 ans et j'en ai honte.
Ça hante toujours ma mémoire.
- Ne faites pas ça!
- Quoi?
Je dois pas utiliser
ce rayon-mémoire pour me souvenir?
C'était le 17 octobre à 13h54.
Quatorze oiseaux volaient.
Je travaillais pour
Les Robots de Maman.
Les robots étaient lents,
raides et refoulés.
Je peux faire un bisou
sur le front de mon maître?
Encore raté.
Mon Dieu. Mon Dieu!
On m 'a obligé
à en créer un plus sportif.
MAMAN
Arrêtez!
J'ai réussi en sacrifiant
le rendement du carburant.
- C'est quoi?
- Un rot.
- Il fait ca souvent?
- Il pète aussi.
Il reste un problème.
Il ne répond pas aux normes
des émissions polluantes.
Conneries!
On le met dans la catégorie
des camions légers pour le sport.
Bon...
L'environnement
peut faire un effort pour l'équipe.
Quel idiot!
Si seulement j'avais fait
un robot plus écolo...
J'étais fatigué et amoureux.
Prends-moi, beau gosse.
Tout est ma faute!
C'est horrible.
Surtout la partie sexe.
Je m'en serais aussi passé.
Tous les robots
descendent de cette création.
C'est la cause du réchauffement.
Je pensais bien
que c'était la faute des robots.
Il ne nous reste qu'une solution,
aussi triste soit-elle.
Je la sens bien.
On doit immédiatement
éteindre, démonter
et détruire tous les robots!
- Attendez...
- Fin de la conférence.
Je vais ramasser
des canettes sur Jupiter.
Paix à tous.
Détruisons tous les robots!
- Pauvre Bender.
- Sois fort, mon pote.
Sors de ta poitrine.
Pour un casse-croûte?
Laissez-moi!
Je la veux même pas, cette bière.
Vous avez rusé pour me faire sortir.
Mais c'est moi qui ai la bière!
J'ai du courrier.
C'EST UNE FÊTE!
On dirait un fête.
Tu aimes faire la fête? T'éclater?
J'organise une grosse fête
pour mes potes robots.
Ce sera ce samedi
sur les îles Galapagos.
Tu n'échapperas pas...
à l'éclate.
Tous les robots doivent venir!
Bizarre.
Pourquoi Nixon, ce mec mal à l'aise,
organiserait une fête,
un évènement si social?
C'est un piège
pour désactiver les robots.
- Pas de réaction?
- On avait deviné.
J'y vais.
On peut te cacher sous des fruits
et te faire passer pour le bol.
- Je vais y aller.
- On te laissera pas!
Il y a des choses
pour lesquelles je tuerais.
Bijoux, vengeance, herbe...
Mais j'ai trouvé un truc
pour lequel je mourrais.
Cette tortue idiote.
Tu es trop bon pour ce monde.
C'est clair.
Ne touchez pas
à mes affaires après ma mort.
Elles sont piégées!
CE SOIR: GRANDE FÊTE
DEMAIN: VENTE DE FERRAILLE
CONCOURS DE CHÂSSIS MOUILLÉS
Ouais, baby! Vas-y, baby...
Ma pauvre. Ça ira mieux si je bois.
Il est bidon, ce bidon...
- T'es un robot!
- Continue.
Votre attention, robots.
Qui pense pouvoir assurer
à une soirée Nixon?
Amusez-vous bien
pendant deux heures
et ne quittez pas l'île
pendant ce temps.
Je vais chercher à fumer.
De la bonne.
Deux heures.
Allez, corps d'Agnew,
on va se les fumer.
- Tu veux danser?
- Non, j'ai pas envie...
Si, t'en as envie.
J'ai modifié mon miroir
pour atteindre les Galapagos.
Tous les robots
seront instantanément détruits.
Et ma contrepartie?
Agnew, tu appartiens
à Wornstrum dorénavant.
Au revoir.
Pas de place pour une tortue
là où je vais.
Ne dis rien,
mais Nixon va tuer tous les robots.
Quoi?
- On va mourir!
- On va dans l'au-delà.
Nixon amène pas l'herbe!
Taisez-vous et écoutez Bender.
J'aime la vie et ses plaisirs
comme vous tous.
Sauf toi, l'hédoniste.
Il faut nous désactiver!
Surtout toi, l'hédoniste.
- Mes excuses pour rien.
- On pollue trop!
On détruit le monde
et on tue les tortues!
- Rien à battre!
- Tu veux te battre?
Viens là!
Que les jeux commencent.
Ecoutez tous!
Bon sang!
J'ai trouvé un moyen
de vous sauver vous et la Terre.
Soit, vous échappez des gaz.
La faute à qui?
On peut les utiliser
pour sauver la planète.
Si vous ventilez tout vers le ciel,
ça éloignera la Terre du soleil
et elle refroidira.
Selon mes calculs,
il faut les forces de chaque robot.
Vite, tout le monde
échappe ses gaz vers le haut.
Mettez les gaz!
Plus fort, plus fort!
Ça marche pas?
Un robot reste poli.
Au secours!
Un milliard de robots
va être exterminé.
Les Jedis vont le sentir passer.
Désolé, copine.
On va mourir d'impuissance,
sur le dos.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous?
J'ai l'air con!
Je suis trop fort!
En route vers mon destin!
Feu!
- Qu'est-ce...
- Raté!
Pour avoir sauvé la Terre
et m'avoir eu,
j'ai l'honneur
et la colère de vous offrir:
La Médaille de la pollution.
Merci, je la mérite.
Maintenant que la Terre
est plus loin du soleil,
l'année sera plus longue?
Plus longue d'une semaine
exactement.
Je la déclare Semaine des Robots!
Cool, baby!

UN MORCEAU DU NEW YORK
ANTIQUE DÉCOUVERT
Ils ont découvert une pizzeria
comme celle oů je travaillais!
Intéressant. Non, inintéressant.
Allons voir comment je vivais
avant de te connaître.
- Tu vivais avant de me connaître?
- Oui, comme beaucoup.
Vraiment?

Ensuite, voici la palette en bois
splendidement préservée.
Les scientifiques disent qu'elle servait
ŕ discipliner les livreurs.
C'est Chez Panucci!
C'est ici que je travaillais.
Pour votre gouverne, ça ne servait pas
qu'ŕ me donner la fessée,
mais aussi ŕ faire des pizzas
et ŕ tuer les rats.
Je ne sais pas d'oů vous tenez ça,
mais je suis une bénévole
formée pendant 45 mn.
On m'a donné un roman d'amour
sur des archéologues.
Passion

Vos diplômes ne m'impressionnent pas.
Je reconnais tout.
Les saucisses séchées,
M. Vitelli, et...
AOŰT 1997
- Oui?
- Pizza pour M. Semord Laqueue.
Personne ici ou ailleurs
ne porte ce nom.
Vous comprendrez un jour
quel idiot vous ętes.
Ca m'étonnerait.
Mon pauvre, t'as pas dű manger
depuis un mois.
Tiens. Si on te demande,
tu t'appelles Semord Laqueue.
Je t'aime bien.
Tu me juges pas comme les autres.
N'est-ce pas?
On se comprend.
On te voit comme un clébard qui pue,
sans copine et qui a un job minable.
Mais tu n'appelles
personne "Monsieur".
Au revoir.
Longue vie ŕ toi et prospčre.
Cette calzone est peu appétissante.
C'est mon chien! C'est un scandale.
Je l'emmčne,
n'essayez męme pas de m'en empęcher.
Puis les gardes l'ont éjecté.
J'étais mort de honte.
On peut pas exhiber
mon chien comme ca.
C'est comme exposer Lassie au Louvre.
Lassie est au Louvre.
Je sais. Je parlais
d'une situation similaire exprčs.
Tu devrais protester,
comme les indigčnes de Mars.
Ils se plaignent du fait qu'on maltraite
les os de leurs ancętres.
Se plaindre ne marche jamais.
Je vais faire de mon mieux!

"SOUVIENS-TOI... L'ÉTÉ DERNIER 2"
Bon chien.
Tu m'attends comme toujours.
Comme ce champignon
dans ma douche.
Voilŕ notre mascotte.
T'as encore nagé dans les égouts, vilain!
- Fry, nettoie!
- Semord, nettoie!
- Bon chien.
- C'est un bon Semord.
Y a des poils de chien
dans ma pizza!
Ce sont des vermicelles.
Y a pas de poils ici.
Il est chou.
Il peut faire 2 choses ŕ la fois:
Manger et nager.
Trois choses!
Ça fait trois jours,
arręte de danser comme ca.
Tu vas attraper la fičvre.
Je suis le Dr Ben Beeler,
c'est moi qui ai découvert votre chien.
Maintenant nommé le Beelersaure.
Je reprends Semord?
Vous cédez ŕ la pression?
Désolé, mais il y a trop ŕ apprendre
de ce fossile
sur les chiens de votre temps.
Il s'appelait Semord.
Il était intime avec la jambe
d'un clochard saxophoniste.
Il sentait le chien mouillé, męme sec.
Il poursuivait le bus n°29.
Le n°29? Intéressant.
On a rien besoin d'autre.
On vous rend votre chien.
Semord!
Mesdames et messieurs,
applaudissez
mon assistant intérimaire!
J'étais d'un côté! Magique!
Tu ne mérites pas de porter
le justaucorps de Fry!
Arręte!
- Bonne nouvelle!
- Il est lŕ!
Et il a besoin d'une poubelle
pour la pierre.
Non, on a découvert que le chien
avait été fossilisé
avec sa structure cellulaire.
Alors on peut le cloner!
Semord va revivre!
Un mammifčre terrien!
T'y crois, Bender?
Mon meilleur ami est de retour!
Pourquoi une convention
d'idiots?
Cubert, mon trésor.
Je vais tenter de cloner le chien
avec les męmes appareils
qui t'ont cloné.
Il y a encore un bout d'orteil.
Sous la coque dure du fossile,
il y a encore un corps moelleux.
Va-t-il se souvenir
de "Walking on Sushine"?
Parfaitement.
Dans ce genre de fossilisation,
on peut lui faire un scanner
et voir ses souvenirs
au moment de sa mort.
Je vais retrouver mon chien!
Bien fait, la Faucheuse!
Sale Faucheuse inefficace.
Je dois juste régler le Clonomate
sur le mode chien.
Le chien dit:
Ça peut durer.
Quel gros nul!
Une pizza ŕ livrer.
Allez!
Je fęte le nouvel an.
T'as rien ŕ fęter.
T'es livreur ce millénaire,
tu seras livreur
le millénaire prochain.
PAS DE POURBOIRE AU LIVREUR
On dirait qu'il veut pas que tu partes.
Ou ton fute est trop court.
C'est n'importe quoi,
tu es trčs beau. Vas-y!
Je ne serai pas long.
Attends mon retour.

T'aurais pas dű.
C'est pour Semord.

Pourquoi tu m'as abonné
au Ronchon?
C'est pas un bon journal.
C'est pour Semord.
Je prépare son arrivée.
Tu perds le ciboulot?
C'est un ętre inférieur!
- Il pouvait aller chercher.
- Moi aussi!
- Il trouvait des os.
- Charlemagne?
Il ne peut pas
faire de lasers avec la tęte.
Ca n'a rien ŕ voir avec toi.
C'est impossible!
Laisse-moi travailler
sur la niche de Semord.
SEMORD
On s'est jamais demandé
si je voulais une petite maison.
Pas que je veuille.
Une petite maison

C'est l'an 2000 qui l'a eu.
Routes incendiées,
rivičres qui explosent,
calculatrices
transformées en missiles...
On ne peut rien faire.
Pourquoi tu chantes
"Walking on sunshine"?
Il veut un truc.
Peut-ętre nous mener ŕ Philip!
- On le suit?
- Pour crever? Négatif.
C'est un guet-apens de l'an 2000.
Pas avec moi. File un sandwich.
C'est bientôt fini?
On doit s'entraîner au corps ŕ corps
si l'ennemi nous enlčve
les pistolets laser des mains
et qu'ils glissent trop loin.
Vous pourriez faire ça ailleurs?
J'installe le lit de Semord.
D'accord.
Aux pieds!
Fry, je ne t'avais pas vu.
Je m'amuse trop
avec mon nouvel ami, Robo-Chiot.
C'est bien.
Je suis allé le promener.
Tu peux le promener.
Aprčs, il faut
lui recharger les batteries.
Viens lŕ! Bon chien.
Robo-Chiot reçoit caresses.
Bender, t'es jaloux du chien de Fry?
C'est trop mignon!
Comment ętre jaloux
quand on a l'amour de Robo-Chiot.
Robo-Chiot, lčche-moi la joue.
Robo-Chiot se prépare ŕ lécher la joue.
Robo-Chiot commence
le léchage de joue.
Léchage en cours.
Léchage complet.
Robo-Chiot est vraiment
mon meilleur ami.
Voilŕ. Parfait.
Bonne nouvelle!
Le Clonomate est pręt!
Enfin!
Robo-Chiot initie
un aboiement de deux heures.
Alerte, maltraitance
de Robo-Chiot!
Voici une fois de plus
le grand Clonomate!
Il demande tant d'électricité
qu'on doit exploiter le pouvoir
élémentaire de la nature męme!
Je parle de la lave en fusion
du centre de la Terre.
Au second sous-sol!
CONTENU PEUT ĘTRE BRŰLANT
Branchement de Clonomate!
Placement du fossile
sur la Plate-clone-forme.
Scanner du cerveau!
Reviens ŕ la vie.
Il voit ce que c'est
qu'ętre le dieu des chiens!
Extracteur d'ADN connecté.
Fry, viens! Le spectacle.
Je suis occupé.
Mais il faut faire le spectacle!
Laisse-moi tranquille!
Je croyais que tu étais mon ami.
Si tu l'aimes tant que ça,
va chercher!
Non!
Il ne te reste que moi!
Je te déteste!
Sale démon de métal!
Ton chien fond.
On est amis ŕ nouveau.
Le chien peut encore survivre.
Il peut?
Ce fossile est fait de dolomite,
le minéral dur et noir
qui se défile pas devant la chaleur.
Par contre, regardez l'effet
de la lave sur ce cygne de glace.
Il aurait fondu
ŕ température ambiante, bien sűr.
Il m'encombrait.
Mais s'il avait été fait
de cette dolomite,
il aurait pu survivre.
Semord existe toujours?
Pour quelques minutes.
C'est de la dolomite!
Je vais le chercher!
Il viendrait pour moi!

FRY ET SEYMOUR
ONT ABÎMÉ LE TROTTOIR
QUELQU'UN AYANT FAIT
DES COCHONNERIES
FERMÉ JUSQU'A NOUVEL ORDRE
CRYOGÉNIE APPLIQUÉE
Jouer ŕ l'imbécile ne le ramčnera pas.
Tout espoir est perdu!
Au revoir, Semord.
Arręte de pleurer.
Tiens.
Je pensais que tu prétendais l'aimer
pour me rendre jaloux.
- Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait?
- Rien.
Ne culpabilise pas.
Je suis désolé.
J'aurais dű comprendre
que tu puisses aimer un inférieur
car je t'aime.
Pas comme en Grčce antique,
mais comme un robot aime un humain,
comme un humain aime un chien et
parfois, comme un gorille aime un chat.
J'y vais!
Je suis professeur
et personne m'écoute!
Tu vas fondre!
Le fossile a une chance
car il est en dolomite.
J'ai 40% de dolomite!
C'est chaud, c'est trčs chaud!
1er janvier 2000
J'ai la gueule de bois.
Mets ce clebs au frigo.
Ne résolvez pas tous vos problčmes
comme ca.
Tu oublies notre devise.
CONGELEZ VOS PROBLEMES!
Vous avez appelé
pour le chien de notre fils?
Vous ętes les Fry. Il est juste lŕ.
Désolés du retard.
On a vomi les sandwichs.
L'an 2000.
Qu'il est énervé!
Notre fils lui manque.
Viens lŕ, rat géant.
Mčne-nous ŕ Philip.
C'est trop long!
- J'y vais!
- Professeur! Lave! Chaud!
C'est ma faute.
J'ai laissé mon ami risquer sa vie
juste pour récupérer mon chien mort.
- Bender!
- Et c'est pour ça qu'on m'appelle
Bender le Magnifique!
Oů vous ętes?
Clonons-nous un chien.
- Ouais!
- Trčs bien.
Faites commencer cette abomination!
Intéressant. On dirait que Semord
est mort au grand âge de 15 ans.
Il a donc vécu 12 ans
aprčs ma congélation?
En effet.
Arrętons.
Super. Fracasse la machine
du type intelligent.
- Pourquoi?
- Réfléchissez.
Semord a vécu toute une vie aprčs moi.
Il doit connaître d'autres chansons.
C'est tant mieux.
"Walking on Sunshine", c'est naze.
Je l'ai eu ŕ 3 ans.
Je l'ai connu et aimé
ŕ cette époque-lŕ.
Je l'oublierai jamais.
Lui, il m'a oublié
il y a bien longtemps.

LE MAL ABSOLU
Ouvert 28 h sur 28
Ah, la bière! Y a du choix,
mais toutes les marques se valent.
Et la Löbrau?
Elle a des trémas!
Laisse tomber! Les champions
boivent de la Pabst Blue Robot.
Je bois pas ça. Les copeaux
de métal me font saigner.
Le bébé veut une limonade?
Attendez d'être soûls
pour vous battre!
On pourrait préparer
notre propre bière.
C'est possible, ça?
Oui. Les gosses de l'orphelinarium
le faisaient tout le temps
Nom d'une bactérie du Liberia!
Mon fils est renvoyé du pensionnat!
- C'est pas ma faute.
- Et toi, Cubert.
Je t'ai cloné à partir d'une
de mes verrues, je peux t'y renvoyer.
Sont-ce des cris de colère
ou de sourds mal appareillés?
- Les deux.
- Quoi?
Du calme.
Gardez votre sang-froid!
Ecoutons l'explication
des petites vermines.
Je n'ai fait que me défendre.
Regarde la lettre du directeur.
On était en physique...
on venait de finir
notre trou noir miniature.
- Fastoche!
- Il est maigrichon, votre trou noir.
Il doit avoir faim.
- Les trous noirs ne mangent pas.
- Les péquenots non plus.
Mon hommewich!
Tu as encore atomisé
nos casse-croûte...
mais c'est la dernière fois.
Sale-le, Dwight.
Quand je me serai resolidifié,
vous verrez ce que gluant veut dire.
C'est sa faute. On n'a pas pu
se défendre avec nos muscles...
- alors on a utilisé notre cervelle.
- Je t'avais dit de pas t'en servir!
Alors voyons,
on a le malt, le houblon.
Il manque plus qu'un récipient
pour faire le mélange.
Maintenant, ça doit bouillir
pendant quelques heures.
Tu te souviens de l'équipe?
- Vous vous souvenez de Cubert?
- Oui.
Alors vous ne verrez pas
d'inconvénients...
à les surveiller pendant un mois.
Voilà mes vieux copains:
Fesses moulées, fesses à l'air...
et l'idiot.
- On fait de la bière.
- L'alcool rend stupide, il paraît.
- Je suis pas... Ca rend pas stupide.
- Tu as raison.
L'alcool est déconseillé aux enfants.
Mais à partir de 21 ans...
il est très conseillé.
Alors fiche le camp!
- C'est pas juste.
- Ras-le-bol!
Quel bidule inutile
construis-tu aujourd'hui?
Quoi?
Oh, c'est ma dernière invention.
Une machine qui reproduit
ma voix à l'identique.
Bonne nouvelle:
Je suis un serpent à lunettes.
Moi? C'est pas
une bonne nouvelle, espèce de...
Combien comptez-vous en vendre?
Quel est le consommateur cible?
Il n'y a pas de consommateur cible.
Que des cibles.
Des cibles qui trembleront quand
on leur annoncera les nouveaux décrets...
avec ma voix tonitruante!
Maintenant, cessez de m'importuner,
bande de crapules!
- Je peux classer?
- Non.
- Je peux détruire ces contrats?
- Non!
Super!
Un tamponneur électrique.
Quel travail tu me donnes!
NUL
Les ingrédients sont cuits.
Avec un arrière-goût
métallique naturel.
Ajoutons la levure.
La levure? Tu veux dire que
quelque chose va grandir en moi?
C'est magnifique.
- Je vous écoute.
- Ici le Pr Farnsworth.
J'ai une livraison
pour votre équipe de débiles.
Vous avez une pizza à livrer
sur Dog Doo 8...
une planète au fin fond de l'univers.
Je peux pas vous dire au revoir,
je suis trop occupé avec mon bric-à-brac.
Et je sens mauvais.
UNE SEMAINE PLUS TARD
Si vous étiez mes fils, vous recevriez
une leçon... de votre père.
A son retour du Sénat.
La barbe!
Qu'ont-ils encore fait?
Ces petits morveux nous ont donné
une fausse livraison.
Sur la planète Dog Doo 8.
Mais l'univers s'arrête
à la planète Dog Doo 7.
- Petit homme, c'est vrai?
- Pourquoi c'est nous qui prenons?
Ils ont perdu 1 semaine.
C'était évident que la mission était bidon.
En plus, ils fabriquent
illicitement de la bière.
Mensonges!
Mensonges et calomnies!
Vous accusez le gentil Bender
d'un délit? C'est le comble!
Vous avez assez traîné ici!
J'allais justement le dire.
On est leurs pères, et il est temps
qu'on agisse comme tels.
Va y avoir de la bagarre.
Trouvez-vous un boulot,
paresseux.
Si je veux qu'ils se fassent corriger,
va falloir que je le fasse moi-même.
Traîne les pieds plus vite!
Vous allez manquer l'inauguration
de notre société.
Votre société?
C'est mignon. Qu'allez-vous vendre?
De la limonade? Du cirage?
Ils ont peut-être construit un hôpital
pour les ours en peluche.
En fait, on a monté
une société de livraison.
Terriblement Express
Bienvenue dans le monde des affaires.
Qui fera appel à une société
avec une enseigne abîmée?
- Personne.
- On a déjà un client.
On livre le Daily Supernova.
Donc vous allez livrer
le journal dans le voisinage?
Non. C'est du sérieux!
Oui. C'est une énorme responsabilité.
C'est vrai.
Le journal pourrait atterrir
dans une flaque!
Notre civilisation pourrait en pâtir.
Pourquoi ils nous traitent
comme des débiles?
On est assez vieux pour trouver
la chaîne Fox puérile.
On va leur montrer.
Tout ce qu'il nous faut...
c'est un vaisseau de livraison
assez robuste.
Voilà!
T'as une pièce?
La pub dit que la livraison
se fait dans les 5 à 6 secondes.
C'est plutôt 7.
Je gonfle sous l'effet de la bière.
Je dois avoir l'air ridicule.
Non. Tu es rayonnant.
- Je l'ai senti bouger!
- Je peux toucher?
T'as trouvé un nom?
J'avais pensé à Benderbrau,
si c'est une brune...
Botwiser, si c'est une blonde.
J'ai toujours eu un faible
pour les blondes.
Je l'ai senti!
Il y a une fissure dans la coque.
La décompression risque
d'être explosive.
Mets un autocollant dessus.
HUILE POUR ROBOTS CRETINS
C'est votre 1ère livraison?
Fais attention, mon petit lapin.
Tu te souviens quand on t'appelait
comme ça? Mon petit lapin.
Dépêchez-vous. Ces journaux
ne vont pas se livrer tout seuls.
Y a que celui du dimanche
qui peut.
Seigneur, il doit y avoir 50 journaux
dans ce paquet.
- Ca fait beaucoup, 50.
- Oui, pour les crétins.
- Trois, deux, un.
- Paré pour le décollage.
Mise à feu!
- A ce soir, pour le dîner.
- Je t'envoie un baiser.
On prend la tangente!
Il se rapproche. Tu peux pas l'éviter.
C'est un chasseur de joues.
Et...
Cible atteinte!
Non!

LES LIVREURS DE JOURNAUX
DE LA SEMAINE
Les affaires vont mal.
Dorénavant, vous serez des esclaves.
Regardez qui voilà.
Notre adorable progéniture!
Que se passe-t-il?
Vous avez besoin de petite monnaie?
Grâce au don de Dwight
pour la comptabilité...
et au mien pour tout le reste...
on a plus d'un million de clients!
On gagne plus d'argent que vous!
Ca t'en bouche un coin, hein?
N'est-ce pas?
Un peu, c'est vrai.
Il vous manque encore un local,
une table de conférence...
et un truc comme ca.
Bonjour.
On n'arrivera jamais
à impressionner nos pères.
On devrait peut-être mettre le feu.
Pour les impressionner, il va falloir
les écraser selon la méthode...
La Foudre de Dwight.
Très bien. C'est moi qui nommerai
la 2ème méthode.
Cette semaine dans The Real World,
le soleil.
Je suis en train de cramer!
Vous savez combien ca coûterait
un appart aussi grand sur le soleil?
Comme vous le savez,
nos fils réussissent brillamment...
sur le même marché que nous.
- C'est bien!
- Génial!
On se sent humiliés.
On a besoin de vous,
fidèle équipe...
pour augmenter les profits
de Planet Express de 800%.
On va commencer par baisser
les salaires. Et pas une petite baisse.
Je sais pas comment vous le dire...
alors comme Fry est insensible,
c'est lui qui le dira.
On bosse plus pour vous!
- Quoi?
- Vos fils nous ont fait une offre.
- On livre des journaux maintenant.
- C'est nous!
On a des journaux à livrer!
Un, deux. Un, deux.
- Oui, chef.
- On s'y met, M. Farnsworth.
Les amis, la situation est critique.
Mais on s'en sortira grâce à vous,
pauvre équipe de paumés fidèles.
- Je sais même pas qui c'est.
- Je suis Scruffy, le gardien.
C'est évident. Maintenant,
il va pas falloir chômer...
pour sauver le Planet Express.
C'est ma pause.
Désolé d'interrompre votre travail
acharné, on a une annonce à faire.
Veuillez accepter ces formulaires
que je suis chargé de vous remettre.
Nom d'un cochon d'Inde!
Ils ont racheté notre société.
Balivernes! J'ai rien signé!
Pour frauder les impôts, il y a 3 ans,
vous avez dit être mort.
Moi, un fraudeur? On fait la sieste
dans un fossé dans le parc...
et les gens insinuent
des tas de choses.
Dans tous les cas, j'hérite
de ton local et de ton vaisseau.
Ce qui signifie que Planet Express
devient...
Terriblement Express!
Sales mioches!
- Vous engagez?
- Non.
Sales mioches!
Voilà. Un million de journaux
pliés et chargés.
Aide-moi à coller ca.
Je l'ai eu dans mes céréales.
Le vaisseau ira plus vite.
Quel raisonnement scientifique
te fait penser ça?
J'ai 12 ans.
Tu sais que, jadis,
ce vaisseau était à moi.
Ca aurait tout aussi bien pu être moi.
Mon Dieu!
Je crois que c'est l'heure!
Vite, Leela!
Apporte des verres frais.
Pousse, Bender! Pousse!
Tu te débrouilles bien.
C'est comme si on m'aspirait
un matelas d'eau.
C'est bientôt fini.
Plus que 2 bouteilles.
Ca va? Je n'entends rien.
C'est une brune.
19 litres, 170 ml.
BENDERBRAU
Fusion à froid
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
C'est une société de livraison,
pas un hôpital.
On s'est crevé le cul à livrer
un million de journaux...
et c'est comme ça que vous
nous remerciez? Avec de la bière?
Comment avez-vous pu livrer
un million de journaux en une heure?
On l'a fait, c'est tout.
Parce qu'on est terribles.
Oui. Terrible.
Bonjour, Terriblement Express,
les livreurs grossiers.
C'est à quel sujet?
Comment?
Vous n'avez pas reçu votre journal?
Depuis quand, vous dites?
Y aurait-il une autre part de bœuf
Bourguignon pour un vieux SDF...
et une autre tequila-paf?
- S'il vous plaît?
- Cessez ces flagorneries...
- espèce de vieux machin ridé.
- Je peux en avoir aussi, ma chérie?
Vous êtes pathétiques.
Etre jaloux de ses enfants!
Vous devriez être contents
qu'ils aient réussi...
au lieu de suivre vos traces.
C'est vrai.
Mais ils ont grandi si vite!
On voulait être meilleurs qu'eux
encore pour quelques années.
Ils sont si talentueux,
ils n'ont plus besoin de leurs pères.
- Papa, on a fait une bêtise!
- Vraiment? Pas de pot, vermines!
Aide-nous. On a accepté
trop de journaux à livrer.
On a jeté le reste des journaux
dans un cratère de la Lune.
Maintenant, tout le monde se plaint.
Et on ne sait pas quoi faire!
Pourquoi avez-vous fait tout ça?
- On voulait que vous soyez fiers.
- Fiers de vous?
Vous nous avez ruinés avec
vos pratiques peu commerciales...
et vous avez manqué totalement
de bienséance.
- Bien sûr qu'on est fiers de vous.
- Evidemment!
Viens, on va arranger ça ensemble,
père et fils.
Heureusement que j'avais ce filet
pour attraper des girafes.
Les enfants, regardez comment
fait un livreur professionnel.
Au revoir!
Je peux me servir du pistolet?
Quel genre de père serais-je
si je refusais?
Il ne reste qu'une maison.
On a réussi!
Fuyons!
Le gluant Brett Blob vit ici.
Il est moche, méchant,
et stupide!
Et la semaine dernière,
on a cassé sa fenêtre.
D'accord. Que fait-on
quand on casse une fenêtre?
- On la rembourse?
- Mon Dieu, non!
On s'excuse avec des mots gentils
et pas chers.
Je croyais avoir entendu la sonnette.
Mais c'était vos "sornettes".
Elle est bonne celle-là, Brett.
Evitons d'entrer dans ce jeu-là.
- On voudrait parler à ton papa.
- Si vous voulez. Papa!
Je suis sûr que son père est
tout à fait normal et sensé.
Que me voulez-vous?
M. Blob, nos fils sont venus
s'excuser pour la fenêtre.
Ils ont compris la leçon
et sont venus réparer les torts.
- Pardon, monsieur.
- Oui, pardon.
Vous pouvez vous mettre
vos excuses où je pense!
On a promis à nos fils
que vous accepteriez leurs excuses.
J'accepterai leurs excuses
quand ils me lécheront le derrière.
Et je n'en ai pas.
- On parle pas comme ça à mon fils!
- Amène-toi, tas de gélatine.
- Oui, vas-y.
- Montre-lui qui est le meilleur.
- Vas-y... papa.
- Allez.
HOPITAL TACO BELLEVUE
C'était génial!
Vous êtes les pères
les plus courageux de l'hôpital.
Vous avez failli l'avoir
avant qu'il vous digère.
Vous êtes mignons.
Si je pouvais ressentir quelque chose,
ce serait de la fierté.
J'avais tort! Je ressens la douleur!
Il est venu finir ce qu'il a commencé.
Jetez-moi par la fenêtre!
Non, attendez.
Je m'en veux de ce qui s'est passé.
Je suis sous pression en ce moment
à cause du boulot.
Ils installent des ordinateurs
pour "améliorer la productivité".
Mais ca n'excuse en rien
mon comportement.
Les gosses doivent savoir
qu'on règle nos différends en parlant...
pas en étant violent.
Veuillez accepter mes excuses.
J'espère qu'on pourra oublier
cet incident embarrassant.
Je crois.
Il paraît que vous vous êtes fait
engloutir par un malabar.
Je me suis dit
que ça vous ferait du bien.
Pourquoi pas. Autant en profiter
tant que j'ai ce cathéter.
Vous nous accompagnez,
M. Blob?
Avec plaisir.
Voilà pourquoi la vie
vaut d'être vécue.
Trois pères passant une journée
avec leurs fils.
On aura appris quelque chose
à nos fils.
Humain ou Blob, c'est ce qui est
à l'intérieur qui compte.

Lorsqu'on regarde le ciel,
de notre regard fuyant,
on peut voir que notre drapeau

Il est plus lŗ!
Oui, patriotes,
je dťteste votre drapeau!
Je l'ai fait avec fiertť.
S'exprimer en agissant avec le cúur,

AMBASSADE DE DECAPODIAN
Je pensais comprendre ce monde,

Mais je n'ai pas plus ma place ici
que sur notre sale planŤte.
- Dťsolť.
- Pourquoi?
Notre planŤte est pourrie.
Je dis stop ŗ la persťcution.
Zoidberg, je vous promets
le soutient du gouvernement.
Pauvre petit. Tu veux un chocolat?
Ambassadeur Mervin,

J'accepte humblement.
Y a pas de marshmallows?
Envahissons cet endroit!
Sans que je le sache.

Du calme, Nixon.
Vous pouvez dťsapprouver

On rigole pas avec la terre.

J'ai ťtť le premier ŗ le dťtester.
Oý lui trouver un avocat?
Je demanderai au ACLU.
AprŤs la chanson.
On ne rigole pas avec la terre
Tuez Zoidberg! Bonsoir!
Salut.
Je suis avocat.
J'aimerais aider votre ami.
- Qui Ítes-vous, vieillard?
- Vieux Waterfall.
Mais on m'appelle vieillard.
Dur ŗ retenir.
J'suis vťtťran de 36 guerres.
J'ai ťtť touchť sur tout le corps

Pour la libertť du drapeau.
Et vous voulez dťfendre Zoidberg?
Vous connaissez le proverbe robot:

Un robot n'est qu'une poubelle

C'est pour la chaleur.
Je condamne ce qu'il a fait

Parlez au nom de la terre,
si vous Ítes prÍt.
Je suis prÍt.
Honorable tÍtes du jury,
cette ťcrevisse a mangť notre drapeau.
Un discours de libertť.
Un droit sacrť sur terre.
La libertť d'expression
concerne ce qui sort de la bouche,
pas ce qui y rentre.
- Veuillez citer un prťcťdent.
- Oui, ma chŤre.
Dans Alabama contre
Iguane Gťant de l'Espace,
m‚cher la constitution fut jugť
discours non protťgť.
Il te l'a coupťe, O'Connor.
M. Waterfall, prťsentez vos arguments
au nom du Dr. Zoidberg.
Je suis nerveux.
2 de mes 3 cúurs
ont une attaque.
C'est sympa un procŤs
quand c'est pas pour soi.
Des nachos?
AÔe, blessure de Goshen.
Je n'ai pas autant de bagou
que l'avocat qui m'est opposť.
Je suis me suis battu
pour cette planŤte.
- Vous voyez ma main?
- Oui.
Non!
Je l'ai perdue en plantant le drapeau
sur la comŤte de Halley.
«a valait le coup.
J'aime tant ce drapeau.
Je l'aime plus que mes sept femmes.
Oui, je suis polygame.
Je mangerais volontiers un drapeau,
si mes intestins n'avaient pas
servi de corde pour hisser un drapeau
et si Áa protťgeait les libertťs
de ceux qui saluent ce drapeau.
Libertťs, comme la polygamie.
Fin de plaidoirie.
Purťe.
Les jurťs et moi
allons nous concerter par tťlťpathie.
Par un vote de 6 contre 3,
cette action n'est pas protťgťe
par la constitution.
6 contre 3? J'ai gagnť!
La Cour ordonne des excuses publiques.
J'accepte vos excuses.
Que Áa n'arrive plus.
- Toi! Dindon de mer.
- M'excuser? Jamais.
Je suis sur cette planŤte
pour sa libertť!
Mais vous devriez
en tirer une lecon.
Essayez toujours,
aucune punition n'est pire
que renier ma libertť!
Vous Ítes donc condamnť ŗ mort.
Laissez-moi finir.
Et double coup dur, la Cour
dťclare la polygamie autorisťe.
Mon mari sera content.
Prenez-le vivant,
qu'il reste quelque chose ŗ tuer.
En arriŤre!
L'ambassade de Decapod 10
ne relŤve pas de votre juridiction!
Envahir ces lieux
est un acte de guerre!
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire,
la crevette?
Vous voulez voir, M. Je-sais-tout?
Attaquez la terre!
Je sais que c'est dur mais faites-le!
L'ťlastique est sur l'autre pince!
PrÍts? Repli!
BIBLIOTHEQUE DU CONGRES
Vous reniez mes libertťs?
On vous fera la mÍme chose
qu'aux Squashs sur Squash.
Vous ťcraser!
- Chewing-gum?
- Bien sŻr!
On va montrer ŗ ces monstres
ce qu'un budget militaire
surenflť peut faire.
Donne-moi les codes
du rťseau de dťfense.
Oui, monsieur.
Identification des lŤvres.
Sans la langue.
Soyons prudents.
On dit qu'il y a peut-Ítre
un agent double.
Je vous ai ŗ l'úil.
- Comment tu t'appelles?
- Hu Main.
Hu Main. J'ai confiance en ce nom.
Va rentrer ces codes
dans l'ordinateur central.
Quelque chose chez cet officier...
Oui, il y a quelque chose.
Il veut vous piquer votre boulot.
Et il pourrait.
L'ennemi approche.
Tirez un missile et faites
que j'aie une mťdaille.
Bien voyante, je sors en boÓte aprŤs.
Tic-tac.
Les dťfenses ne rťpondent pas.
Les Decapodians se sont peut-Ítre
emparťs des codes.
Assumez-en la responsabilitť.
PrÍt, prÍt...
Maintenant!
LES ENVAHISSEURS GAGNENT
Comment se battre pour la libertť
et faire des terriens vos esclaves?
Vous ne mťritez pas la libertť
avant d'avoir connu
le manque de libertť.
AÔe!
C'est pour quoi ce tas de boue?
«a te regarde pas, esclave.
Tu sauras assez tŰt.
Fais ton tas de boue.
Au boulot!
SOUS NOUVELLE ADMINISTRATION
Je ne suis pas un bon esclave.
Je pense ŗ un 3e cycle de coiffure.
«a ne peut plus durer.
Aujourd'hui, on riposte!
- Il est dťjŗ 22h.
- T'as raison.
Demain, on riposte!
Bonne chance.
Nos technologies ne marchent plus.
Moi, si.
Attends, j'ai une de ces choses.
- Une migraine avec des images.
- Une idťe?
MUS…E DE L'ARMEMENT
ARSENAL SECRET DE MERE TH…R…SA
De mon temps, on avait pas
d'armes digitales.
Mais on se tuait trŤs bien.
L'arbalŤte.
Une machine sans pitiť.
Le Bender du 15e siŤcle!
Pas assez gros.
Il faut descendre toute une armťe.
Un truc capable d'un crime de guerre...
Wouah!
AÔe.
Esclaves, voici le fruit
de votre travail:
Le Palais mobile de l'oppression!
Super!
Vous savez que les forces d'occupation
sont coŻteuses.
Avec le Palais mobile de l'oppression,
quelques dignitaires peuvent opprimer
la planŤte ŗ tarif rťduit!
Vaisseaux, rentrez chez vous!
CHAPEAUX PLIABLES
ACCORD…ONS PLIANTS
PEIGNES INCASSABLES
Essayez donc, dťmons de mer!
Je me battrai avec Ol'Freebie!
Vous pouvez m'ťcraser
mais pas mon esprit!
Oh, mon esprit!
ArriŤre grand-pŤre, non!
Encore une victime de la m‚le-o-cratie.
Vous avez tuť mon avocat!
De rien.
Il a dťfendu ma libertť.
- C'ťtait un homme bon et respectable.
- Je demande des funťrailles sataniques.
L'esclavage et l'oppression
- peuvent g‚cher notre leÁon de libertť.
- Prends un cachet.
On continue ŗ ťcraser!
Vous n'avez pas encore gagnť.
Vous pensiez pas qu'on irait au musťe
voler un missile
attirť par la chaleur!
Je vous connais pas.
Ca va faire des saletťs.
C'est votre plan secret?
Ce genre de missile ne marche
pas contre le Palais mobile.
La technologie de Decapodia
a le sang froid!
On regarde Zoidberg!
Il faut bien que je fume!
Comment as-tu pu?
Je te trouvais cool.
Ecoutez, peuple de la terre.
Je profane un drapeau pour prťserver
la libertť qu'il reprťsente.
Zoidberg, tu nous as libťrťs!
J'aimerais pouvoir te serrer.
Je m'en passerai. Tu sais pourquoi.
Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!
Si seulement ils pouvaient autant
apprťcier la libertť sur ma planŤte.
C'est le cas!
C'est ma planŤte, ici!
Maintenant, pour brandir
ce beau nouveau drapeau,
un homard rouge qui ne vous g‚chera
pas le dÓner, le Dr. John Zoidberg!
Vous Ítes bon, Nixon.
Si vous le croquiez
pour le journal de demain?
- Je ne peux pas.
- Vous l'avez mťritť.
Juste pour goŻter.
Maintenant,
c'est un grand vieux drapeau!
Vas-y, Zoidberg!
Je me demande quel goŻt a le linceul.
Bien jouť!

LE CHOIX DE YÉTI
Kif et le polichinelle dans le tiroir
C'est un spot d'enfer
pour faire du dance-board.
- C'est clair.
- J'ai eu des appels?
Oui. 2 transmissions télésoniques
de Kif il y a 2 heures.
Mon Kif a appelé?
- Kif?
- Amy, tu es rentrée!
Encore une heure et je raccrochais.
Fallait laisser un message.
J'ai inondé ton répondeur
de messages,
- mais apparemment, tu n 'as rien reçu.
- Bender!
J'y peux rien si tu me consultes pas.
Messages effacés.
Cette relation à distance
est trop difficile à gérer.
Un centimètre nous sépare
et c'est l'horreur.
Alors tu imagines ce que je ressens
avec 1 milliard d'années-lumière!
Kif, ne pleure pas,
tu vas être ballonné.
Lieutenant,
j'ai bouché le siphon avec...
Mais qui vois-je?
C'est trop beau pour être vrai.
Leela les gros lolos!
Désolée. Ça passe pas!
Bonne nouvelle!
Il faut livrer des médocs sur Nigel 7.
Le cachet sort de sa cachette.
Vous allez sur Nigel 7?
Kif est en mission dans le coin!
- Vous pourriez me déposer.
- Dans tes rêves!
Y a pas marqué taxi sur ce vaisseau!
Si vous me cherchez,
je serai dans le dôme de la colère.
C'est un long voyage.
Des siestes hibernatives
nous feront économiser de l'oxygène.
Je marche même pas à l'oxygène.
Me voilà, Kif.
C'est ce qui s'appelle
une pantalonnade!
VAISSEAU PROCHE!
COLLISION IMMINENTE!
Quoi encore? Activez les fenêtres.
Kif, je ressens une perturbation
très sensuelle dans la Force.
Préparez-vous
à un tête-à-tête très intime.
Oui, capitaine.
La fin du rêve est en direct.
D'accord. J'en étais là:
Il faudrait viser plus bas
et plus en douceur.
Passagère clandestine
et voleuse de vaisseau?
C'est si romantique
que j'en ai des frissons.
Je n'ai pas réfléchi.
Mes lèvres avaient besoin
de ton absence de lèvres.
Amy, l'univers qui nous sépare
est un cauchemar.
J'ai beaucoup réfléchi.
Accepterais-tu d'emménager avec moi?
Ici?
On risque d'être un peu à l'étroit.
C'est plus grand que ça en a l'air.
Tu pourrais prendre le sol
et moi, le plafond.
Kif, ta créativité et ta gentillesse
te perdront.
- Mais je ne suis pas sûre de...
- Chut!
Avant de te prononcer, viens par là.
C'est l'Holo-tel
Il simule tous tes souhaits.
C'est sans danger,
sauf si les hologrammes
deviennent réels.
Y a pas de raison.
Ça te donnera un aperçu
de notre vie ensemble.
Ordinateur, lance le programme Kif 1.
C'est magnifique!
Esprit! C'est le seul poney
qui manque à collection!
C'est pour ça que je l'ai programmé.
4 millions de lignes en basic.
Et que dis-tu de cette vie-là?
Lance le programme Kif 2.
Oh, Kif!
On pourrait vivre
au bord de la Mer Tranquilibrius.
Pour toi,
je serais prêt à décrocher la lune.
J'y suis presque.
On dirait qu'elle est coincée.
Je t'aime!
Lance le programme Kif
2 points 2 barres 3!
Pas mal. On se croirait chez ma tante.
Ça me serait égal
de vivre dans les W. -C. D'une gare.
Parce qu'avec toi,
ce serait la vie de château.
Kif, j'adorerais vivre avec toi.
Mais pas encore.
J'ai encore plein de choses
à découvrir par moi-même.
Que se passe-t-il?
Zut. Je crains une nouvelle panne.
Tant qu'on ne croise pas Attila, on...
Regarde. C'est Esprit!
Et voilà le Professeur Moriarty.
Jack l'Eventreur!
Lincoln le méchant!
On dirait
que la simulation a encore foiré.
Meurtre et chaos.
Vous connaissez la procédure.
Le vrai hologramme du faux Lincoln
le méchant est de retour!
L'Holo-tel déconne.
Tout devient réel.
La dernière fois,
j'ai dû faire 3 tests de paternité.
- Oh, mon Dieu!
- Ecoutez, les méchants de l'Histoire.
Rentrez à l'Holo-tel
avant que je m'énerve.
Non! Pas tirer bâtons de feu
dans canoë spatial.
Engendrer décompression explosive!
Arrête ton charabia techno-spatial
à la noix, Attila roi des Huns.
- Kif, tiens bon!
- C'est le but!
- Accroche-toi!
- Par ici!
Ne me lâche pas!
Bon voyage!
Oh, bon sang!
J'ai bien mérité une petite séance
de relaxation.
Je vais à l'Holo-tel.
CLINIQUE DE LA DERNIERE CHANCE
A part quelques os fêlés,
une hémorragie interne
et un cœur amoché,
vous allez bien.
Et Kif est enceinte.
C'est merveilleux!
C'est pas génial?
Je suis enceinte.
Oui, c'est incroyable.
Un vrai miracle.
Et pas un miracle à la noix
comme un lever de soleil.
- Mais, t'es pas un homme?
- Ouais.
Et moi qui croyais
avoir enfin compris les humains!
Je vais me le faire!
Ramène-toi, Kif!
A vrai dire, on se demande tous
ce qui s'est passé.
Nous t'écoutons, Kif.
Et n'épargne aucun détail croustillant.
C'est simple.
Lorsque les gens de mon espèce
tombent profondément amoureux,
ils entrent
dans une "phase réceptive".
C'est écœurant. Continue.
La peau se transforme alors
en une membrane semi-perméable
qui laisse filtrer les gènes.
J'ai tenu la main d'Amy, et voilà!
D'accord. Mais j'espère que c'est tout.
Amy, tu vas devenir maman!
BÉBÉ
A BORD
Quelle belle preuve d'amour!
Et tout ça, du bout des doigts.
Attendez. Souvenez-vous
du trou dans le vaisseau.
- En effet.
- Kif nous a tous touchés.
- On a pu le féconder.
- C'est clair!
Qu'en penses-tu, Kif?
Oui, j'aurais pu tomber
enceinte comme ca
ou par le siège des W. -C.
Mais c'est impossible.
J'ai des toilettes privées.
Ca va mieux!
Au fait, Kif, ta chasse d'eau est réglée
sur "assommer" au lieu de "tuer".
C'est sûrement moi la mère.
Ou quelqu'un d'autre.
Bien sûr, j'espère que c'est moi,
mais faisons un test, au cas où.
Un test! Je réclame un test!
J'ai construit cet analyseur génétique
sur un coup de tête.
Mais j'ai eu du nez!
Chers patients, veuillez entrer.
Prélevons d'abord un échantillon d'ADN.
Une fois activée, la materni-fugeuse
atteindra les 10000 tr/mn,
rejetant toutes les mères improbables...
Ou les pères. Peu importe.
Plus vite!
Super! L'éjection de Fry
prouve qu'il n'est pas la maman.
- Pareil pour Brannigan.
- Merci, mon Dieu.
Zoidberg? Tu fichais quoi, là-dedans?
C'est là que je vis.
Je n'ai pas d'autre maison.
Amy? Ça veut donc dire...
Leela a dû me toucher
quand j'avais ôté mon gant.
Je comprends mieux le slogan:
"Sortez couvert".
- Tout ça me dépasse.
- Comment as-tu osé, Leela?
Notre amour a dû enduré
toute cette haine et maintenant, ça?
- Je ne te suffis donc pas!
- Je vous en prie, Capitaine.
Merci pour ton ADN, Leela,
mais dans mon espèce,
la vraie mère
est celle qui a fait naître l'amour.
On appelle cette personne
le "Smizmarr". Et le mien, c'est Amy.
Le siège des W. -C. Serait donc
l'oncle du bébé?
PUB D'O'ZORGNAX
MINEURS ACCEPTÉS
- Désolée d'avoir mis Kif enceinte.
- C'est rien.
On devrait bien rigoler à la fête.
Je vais noter la date.
Jeudi. Fête bébé.
Entrée.
Je vais devoir réorganiser ma vie.
Initialiser mode maternité.
MATERNITÉ
A la future maman!
HOLIDAY ROBOT INN
VIVE
LES TRUCS DE BÉBÉ!
Zoidberg?
J'avais le visage coincé
dans la pizza.
- Maman, papa, je sais, c'est bizarre...
- Oui, d'accord.
Mais peu importe d'où vient la graine.
On est contents d'être grands-parents.
- Quelle ouverture d'esprit, Mme Wong.
- Appelez-la "mamie".
Oui. Nuit et jour!
Je vois que tout le monde est là.
- Et aussi Zoidberg.
- Ouvrons les cadeaux.
- Oh, oui!
- Je tiens plus.
Commençons par celui de Bender.
C'est mes chaussons de bébé.
- C'est lourd!
- C'est du bronze.
Celui-ci vient de Leela.
J'adore le nœud.
- Je me demande ce que c'est.
- J'avoue que moi aussi.
- Un panier! Pour pique-niquer?
- Ca me tenait à cœur.
C'est celui dans lequel
j'ai été abandonnée.
Idéal pour pique-niquer.
- Ça, Amy, c'est pour toi.
- Un dance-board?
Presque. Une planche à repasser.
On a converti ton vieux dance-board.
T'en auras plus besoin.
- Vous avez fait quoi?
- Désormais, t'es maman.
C'est sur la vague des responsabilités
que tu vas surfer.
C'est le plus beau jour de ma vie.
Merci pour ces fantastiques cadeaux.
- Mon préféré, c'est...
- Le mien!
...le lien qui m'unit à mon Smizmarr.
Bientôt, la vie qui croît en moi
dépendra de nous deux.
Je le sens déjà se nourrir, se tortiller,
chercher, enquêter.
Sous peu, mon bas-ventre explosera,
nous entraînant loin, très loin
dans les eaux troubles
de la parentalité.
C'est magnifique.
Effectivement, c'est...
Non! Je n'y arriverai jamais!
Oh, mon Dieu!
Comment peut-elle me quitter?
Les femmes sont si immatures
quand il s'agit d'assumer un enfant.
Ça s'agite! Je vais accoucher.
Je dois rentrer
procéder au rite sacré des naissances.
Envoie-nous une carte postale.
La route sera longue
jusqu'au marécage
où je suis venu au monde.
Laisse-moi t'accompagner.
- Mon ADN est en jeu.
- Non, Leela.
La tradition exige
que mon Smizmarr m'accompagne.
Mais comme Amy s'y refuse,
je dois m'y rendre seul.
Adieu.
Je doute que l'on se revoie.
Ça va déjà beaucoup mieux.
C'est quoi ce truc? Une rainette?
Un crapaud? Ou ta mère?
C'est une crapouille venimeuse.
Attention.
Me revoilà, les amis.
Regardez.
Le lieu de naissance sacré
de mes ancêtres.
Ça sent le slip sale.
- Je suis la Sage-Femme.
- Bonjour.
Je suis Kif, du clan Kroker,
et je souhaite accoucher.
D'après les écrits, il faut
"laisser le thé de la vie infuser
avant de le servir bien chaud."
- Où est votre Smizmarr?
- Elle n'est pas venue.
Quelle tristesse! Quelle honte!
Désolée d'en rajouter une couche.
Tant qu'Amy est dans mon cœur,
j'ai la force de deux êtres.
On dirait
qu'Amy a arrêté de faire du sport.
Le thé bout. Il est l'heure
de serrer la main de votre Smizmarr.
Désolée. J'ai tellement l'habitude.
J'ai appris ça par cœur.
- C'est pas grave.
- Tant mieux.
A présent, tournez-vous
et plongez votre regard dans le sien.
Tu veux ma photo?
Que l'amour qui vous unit aujourd'hui
vous unisse à jamais.
Le thé de la vie est prêt.
Les procréateurs doivent à présent
prononcer leur nom et boire.
- Amy.
- Kif!
Amy! Est-ce toi
ou ai-je perdu la tête?
Les deux.
J'ignore encore si je suis prête,
mais je t'aime.
Je voulais te soutenir.
Génial. J'ai plus qu'à recommencer.
Trop tard. Les jeux sont faits.
Oh, mon Dieu!
- Souris!
- Tu vas y arriver, Kif.
Nom d'un laser!
Oh, bon sang!
C'est bon, ils sont dans l'eau?
Touchez pas à mes bébés!
Naissance accomplie.
- Dieu merci.
- Sur ce, je vous laisse.
Mais vu qu'on est chez moi, je reste.
Vous n'aurez qu'à m'ignorer.
- Félicitations.
- Bien joué, mollasson!
Adieu, ADN.
- C'était beau mais gerbant.
- C'est la vie!
Tout semble bien parti, Amy.
Dans 20 ans, ils auront des jambes
et pourront regagner la terre ferme.
D'ici là, je serai prête.

Via EgoutCom.
Sponsor officiel des égouts.
Regarde, Morris!
C'est Leela!
Salut la compagnie.
Prêts à remonter à la surface?
On a hâte,
mais on veut pas te faire honte.
Ta mère et moi sommes des monstres.
Stresse pas.
Et arrête de faire ton mutant.
J'ai trouvé ce joli sac
pour porter sur ma tête. En soldes!
Il est pas question
que tu portes un joli sac sur la tête.
Je n'aurai jamais honte de mes parents.
On se voit ce week-end.
Devinez à qui je viens de parler?
- Non.
- Mes parents!
Ils vont enfin
sortir des égouts pour me voir.
T'as perdu ton œil?
Ce sont des mutants!
C'est illégal de faire surface
pour ces minables
génétiquement inférieurs.
Je parle pas pour toi, bien sûr.
La mairie m'accorde
un droit de visite spécial.
Tu pourrais m'avoir
un permis de tuer?
Bien sûr.
Mains nues ou flingue?
Avec des cordes de piano.
Bonne nouvelle.
Le super-robot exterminateur de Pi-kéa
vient d'arriver.
Vive le bas de gamme suédois!
De quoi a-t-on besoin?
IL VOUS FAUT:
On a tout!
Rien ne vaut
la bonne vieille huile de coude.
Terminé!
Il manque seulement 6 pièces.
Ils sont quand même forts,
ces Suédois.
J'ai mal partout. J'ai l'impression
d'avoir fait un match de catch.
Et moi, que j'ai été mutilé
par Jésus.
Cabinet Médical
J'ai la solution.
Une super-crème miracle
que j'ai achetée à un représentant.
"Allez, approchez!", qu'il disait.
Je me suis dit: "C'est trop beau
pour être vrai".
Il disait
que j'avais l'air intelligent!
"On fait affaire?", j'ai dit.
Deux heures plus tard, il avait mis
les voiles avec mes 60 $!
Mais j'avais ma crème miracle.
Mauvaise nouvelle.
Le super-robot a super-explosé!
Echangez-le
contre une tour à CD bancale
et ces boulettes de viandes rances
dont ils ont le secret.
Vous auriez un instant?
J'habite loin. Ma caisse
est en panne et ma tante est malade.
Il lui faut des médocs et je dois
payer le bus, alors je vous attaque!
- Filez-moi votre fric!
- Je crois pas vos sornettes.
- Peu importe. Je vous attaque!
- Aucun bus ne va à Loin.
Filez le fric ou mon robot tire!
Ne me forcez pas
à vous faire du mal.
J'ai trop peur
pour trouver mes poches.
J'enlève mon fut
et je vous le donne.
Ça fait peur à voir!
Tire, Andrew!
Tire encore, Andrew!
FEUX D'ARTIFICE ILLÉGAUX
Des T-Shirts pare-lasers?
Vous allez voir!
Ça va pas la tête?
Raté. Et après des années
de préparation.
Tu fais plus partie du gang.
Comment a-t-on survécu?
D'où viennent ces pouvoirs?
On a peut-être tous un anneau magique,
mais invisible.
Alors on ne s'en rend pas compte.
Et on ne sent pas l'anneau.
Attends, Fry! Ecoute ça.
"Peut provoquer des super-pouvoirs
chez les humains."
Dingue! Des super-pouvoirs
juste en appliquant la crème?
Une drogue qu'on a pas
à purifier!
De quels pouvoirs a-t-on hérité?
"Super-force"?
- Oui.
- "Vitesse d'enfer"?
- C'est bon.
- Pour sûr.
"Super-domination
des créatures de la mer".
- Zoidberg, ramène-toi.
- Va te faire!
- Ça a pas l'air.
- Non.
C'est incroyable!
Je vais pouvoir remplir mes journées
de 2 fois plus d'activités routinières.
Leela, tu oublies l'essentiel.
Gamine, c'était quoi ton rêve?
D'avoir des parents.
La bonne réponse:
Être un super-héros!
On a des super-pouvoirs,
et on est Américains. C'est inespéré.
J'ai toujours voulu mettre
ma violence au service des autres!
- Faisons équipe!
- Tu le regretteras à peine.
Un pote m'a dit qu'il vous avait attaqués
et que vous aviez des super-pouvoirs.
Exact. Grâce à cette crème géniale.
Leela et moi
allons combattre le crime en duo.
Vous combattez le crime! Cool!
Vous bossez en duo?
C'est super les duos.
Mais, bon, vous risquez
d'être vite débordés.
A plus.
Avec 2 humains, il devrait y avoir
un robot pour équilibrer les choses.
Mais, bon...
J'ai trois costumes pour vous.
Je suppose que je pourrais
jeter le troisième.
Joins-toi à nous.
Mais t'es pas plutôt
un fournisseur pour les criminels?
En plus, la crème est inefficace
sur les robots.
Et alors, je suis déjà super fort.
Et je peux faire ça avec mon bras:
Je sais aussi faire ca:
Chers New New-yorkais!
Nous sommes vos nouveaux super-héros.
- Et nous...
- La ferme!
Il est 4 h du mat et c'est la 1re fois
que je m'endors en 30 ans!
Désolée!
Une nouvelle ère de justice
vient de commencer.
Quoi?
Avis aux filous, voyous
et hors-la-loi.
Vous feriez bien de rentrer
dans vos taudis, bande de cafards!
Sinon, vous vous ferez
réduire en bouillie par
les Nouveaux Justiciers.
- Capitaine Jadis!
- Castagnella!
Et Super-Roi!
Le meilleur des trois!
DES JUSTICIERS FONT LA LOI
Capitaine Jadis, vous êtes sexy
dans votre combinaison moulante.
On peut se revoir?
Je suis dans le bottin.
Une fois que j'aurai révélé mon nom,
mon adresse et une copie
de mon certificat de naissance...
T'es fou! Notre identité secrète
doit rester secrète.
- Pour tout le monde?
- Pour tout le monde en particulier.
Et pourquoi ça?
A force de tout casser
sur notre passage,
on pourrait se faire traîner
en justice.
Mouais. T'as peut-être raison.
Et tous les bandits de cette ville
nous en veulent.
- Ils s'attaqueront à notre famille.
- Super-Roi n'a pas de famille.
Ça va, gamin?
HÔTEL DE VILLE
Et voilà.
Deux passes journée, spécial mutants.
Merci, M. Merdenmeyer.
Oui, je suis le maire.
Quoi? Un horrible crime?
Un scélérat! Des citoyens en danger?
Excellent!
J'appelle tout de suite
les Nouveaux Justiciers.
- Ils devraient déjà être là.
- A la prochaine.
Restez! Ils vont arriver.
Vous êtes trois, eux aussi,
c'est parfait!
Il marche ou quoi, ce clown?
Ils attendent le déluge?
Zut, j'avais oublié!
Mon appartement est en feu.
Et moi, je suis à la bourre
pour mon partiel de droit.
Moi, j'en ai marre de vivre!
Castagnella, Capitaine Jadis, Sire.
Vous tombez à pic.
Le Musée d'Histoire Naturelle
sera cambriolé, demain, à 9 heures.
La Gémeraude Quantum est la cible.
Qui ferait ca?
Un terrible escroc, le Garde-Chasse,
qui se fait aider par une bande
d'animaux compétents.
Une bande de cons pétants.
Noté.
L'équipe est composée d'un blaireau
au passé douteux et prêt à tout.
Un éléphant qui n'oublie jamais...
de tuer.
Et un crabe qui s'appelle Chanceux,
alias Casse-croûte.
Comptez sur nous, M. Le Maire.
Que justice soit faite!
Retiens l'ascenseur!
PASSE
POUR LA SURFACE
On est là aussi.
Que vas-tu faire de tes parents?
On a déjà planifié de neutraliser
le Garde-chasse au musée, à 9 h.
Pas de souci.
J'ai dit à mes parents
de venir au musée, à 10 h.
Neuf, dix, poil aux saucisses!
A votre service.
MUSÉE D'HISTOIRE NATURELLE
FONDATEUR
TARIF SUGGÉRÉ 5$
Le Garde-chasse est en retard
pour son casse. Quelle incorrection!
Enfer et damnation, 10 h!
Mes parents doivent m'attendre
et je suis toujours en costume!
Les voilà!
C'est bizarre.
Tu crois qu'elle a oublié?
Stresse pas. Elle doit avoir honte.
Hé, les monstres. Retournez
à la bouche d'égout la plus proche!
Mais nous avons un passe.
Signé par le maire.
C'est louche.
Jamais entendu parler du maire.
Le Garde-chasse!
Désolé d'être à la bourre.
Mesdames, messieurs, circulez!
Je vole tout.
Y aura bientôt plus rien à voir!
Vous ne toucherez à rien.
Que personne ne bouge.
Les super-héros.
Ou devrais-je dire, les super-zéros?
- Ça, c'était pas gentil.
- Animaux, à l'attaque!
Il est interdit
de nourrir les animaux.
Avec un coup de poing, je vais
te renvoyer dans l'autre hémisphère.
Un homme qui boxe avec un kangourou
est un étrange spectacle.
Mais un kangourou qui affronte
un robot? Ça, ça me dépasse.
Casse-croûte!
Bien joué, Orteil.
J'y comprends plus rien.
Ils doivent tourner un film.
Non, ils jouent trop mal.
Si on vous demande quand j'ai disparu,
vous direz: "maintenant".
Dans tes rêves!
On va te mettre en captivité.
Jeunes insensés! Parler de me mettre
derrière les barreaux serait plus spirituel.
- Va chercher!
- Non! Tu tombes pas assez vite.
C'est bon. Je l'ai!
Non, je l'ai pas!
Vous avez sauvé la Gémeraude.
Mais le Garde-chasse court toujours,
ce qui prouve que le pire des animaux,
- c'est le Garde-Chasse!
- Tu te lèves quand tu veux.
Mes parents s'en vont!
Je dois vite enlever ce costume.
- Bravo à nos Justiciers.
- Merci à vous.
Cette Gémeraude coûte presque autant
que les dégâts
que vous avez provoqués.
Les contribuables
vous en sont reconnaissants.
C'est bien qu'elle ne nous aime pas.
Elle sera moins triste à notre mort.
Maman? Papa? Je suis là!
J'ai même des casques pour une visite
guidée de la tombe de Liberace!
Chérie, tu n'as pas à t'excuser
de nous avoir fait faux bond
pour notre seule
et unique visite à la surface.
J'aimerais vous expliquer,
mais je ne peux pas.
Mais croyez-moi,
j'ai une raison valable.
Je suis désolée
de vous décevoir.
Leela, tu ne peux pas nous décevoir.
Nous sommes,
et serons toujours, fiers de toi.
Tu es notre petite fille adorée.
Et puis zut! Autant vous le dire.
Je suis Castagnella!
- Nom d'un tentacule!
- Tu es un super-héros!
C'est fantastique!
Fallait-il que ton costume
soit aussi moulant?
Ma fille est un super-héros!
On devrait faire des T-shirts!
Et des F-Shirts, pour nos amis
avec 2 bras du même côté.
Non, il ne faut surtout pas
le dire à qui que ce soit.
En aucun cas.
- Et si je suis bourré?
- Papa, tu bois?
- Même bourré, c'est top secret.
- D'accord, bouche cousue.
A vrai dire,
je ne devrais même pas porter ça ici.
Il faisait frais.
Je me suis couverte.
Qu'elle est futée!
LAC MUTAGENE
- Au fait, ma fille est Castagnella.
- Leela est Castagnella?
- Tu déconnes!
- Motus et bouche cousue.
C'est un secret.
Vous êtes les seuls au courant.
La fille de ce mec est Castagnella!
- Ne le répète à personne.
- Entendu.
Bonsoir, les super-héros.
Vous me remettez?
Votre visage, plutôt laid,
soit dit en passant, ne me dis rien.
- C'est pas l'heure de la sieste?
- Oui, saperlipopette!
Comment avez-vous découvert
notre identité?
Mon petit oiseau me l'a dit.
Leela l'a dit à ses parents
et ils ont vendu la mèche.
Leela, la personne que cet oiseau imite
dit-elle la vérité par perroquet interposé?
Oui, mes parents avaient de la peine
et j'ai pas pu faire autrement.
Mais je leur avais bien précisé
de le garder pour eux.
On trouve pas ça drôle.
Voilà quelque chose
qui devrait vous intéresser.
- Maman! Papa!
- Leela, pardonne-nous.
Surtout ton père qui a cafté.
Encore merci, Morris!
- Ça va? Vous n'êtes pas blessés?
- Non, mais mon allergie me reprend.
Oh, bon sang!
Il y a des poils dans toute la maison.
Les animaux grimpent sur tout.
Garde-Chasse,
qu'attends-tu de nous?
La Gémeraude, bien sûr.
Je la veux avant minuit,
sinon tes parents seront dévorés
par des piranhas,
entraînés à marcher
sur la terre ferme.
Sauve-nous, Leela!
Enfin, si t'as rien de mieux à faire!
On a pas le choix.
On doit voler la Gémeraude!
Mais le crime n'est-il pas contraire
à notre éthique?
Je ne sais plus où j'en suis.
Bender?
Inutile de dire que Super-Roi
est super-dégoûté par le vol.
Mais quand faut y aller,
faut y aller!
Flûte! Y a plus de crème
dans le tube de crème!
Vérifie le bouchon.
Il pourrait contenir un petit trésor.
Macache.
On est fichus.
Macache? C'est trop tard
pour changer mon nom de super-héros?
Ayez l'air naturel.
Ils ignorent qu'on joue la comédie.
Ce costume pèse une tonne.
Capitaine Jadis?
C'est vrai que vous êtes blindé
- contre la douleur?
- Même pas mal!
Tout va bien, les super-héros?
Tout baigne, l'ami.
On fait juste notre ronde.
- Tout roule, alors.
- Tout baigne.
Chope-la!
Yo! Ils ont retourné leur veste.
Pas cool!
Attrapez-les.
Plus un geste ou vous allez mordre
notre super-poussière!
- C'est ça, ta tanière?
- Mais non.
J'allais pas vous montrer où j'habite.
C'est mille fois mieux qu'ici.
T'excite pas.
Voilà ta Gémeraude à la noix.
Faucon, va chercher!
C'était pas nécessaire.
Affaire réglée.
Solomon, à la tanière!
Maman! Papa!
Désolée pour le kidnapping
par un taré avec ses piranhas.
On est contents de participer
un peu à ta vie.
C'est ma faute.
- J'aurais dû garder le secret.
- Oui.
Je voulais pas que vous pensiez
que j'ai honte de vous.
C'est gentil.
Mais c'est normal pour un enfant
d'avoir honte de ses parents.
- Oh, oui!
- Et pour les parents,
d'être déçus par leur enfant.
Dieu nous en garde.
Tu pourrais appeler plus souvent.
Et soigne ta mauvaise haleine,
veux-tu?
Tant qu'on a la tenue,
on se fait un cambriolage?
Pourquoi pas.
Si tu crois qu'on devrait.
En avant les super-héros!

Yo, Capitaine Cataracte,
on fait quoi, lŕ?
Il est 14h30. Allons dîner,
c'est l'heure du menu carte vermeille.
Et votre gargouille?
Ma quoi?
Bonjour, Mavis.
Surprise de me revoir si tôt?
Mavis est morte.
Voici ma carte de réduction
pour grand-pčre grincheux.
- Elle n'est plus valable.
- Elle est valable ŕ vie.
La vôtre est finie.
Vos dents n'ont rien ŕ faire
dans votre pantalon.
Je ne peux pas les garder
dans la bouche, elles sont nucléaires!
- Elles m'ont mordu le doigt.
- Non! Elles ont goűté au sang humain!
Bonne viande.
On en a parlé et on pense tous
que vous ętes trop vieux.
On a décidé d'ętre cléments
et de vous faire jouvencer.
Grand Dieu, non!
Du calme. Se faire jouvencer
est le nouveau spa ŕ la mode.
Un lavement
au cartilage de requin!
J'aime ętre vieux!
Je ne dois ni parler ŕ mes parents,
ni aider mes potes ŕ déménager,
ni comprendre les sitcoms
d'aujourd'hui.
D'accord, on ne vous forcera pas
avant la fin de ma phrase.
Sautez-lui dessus!

Je suis Heather,
votre jouvenceuse personnelle.
Commencons
par un traitement botulique.
Va te faire, Heather!
CHAMPIGNONS CHAUDS
EN BOÎTE
A petites doses, la toxine botulique
retend les muscles faciaux
au lieu de vous tuer de facon horrible.
Rendez-moi mon visage qui pend!
Attentions aux abats!
Il y a encore beaucoup de rogne
dans ces bourrelets.
Plus fort.
Grave cas de vieillesse.
Essayons un traitement plus fort.
Un bain relaxant
dans du goudron brűlant.
Il n'est ni nécessaire
ni judicieux d'ętre nu.
C'est ce que mon prof de tennis
me dit toujours.
Le goudron décolle l'âge du corps,
ce que les scientifiques
appellent un miracle.
J'ai pas le temps!
Je dois aller acheter un fruit
avec une réduction et le rapporter
en faisant attendre les autres clients
pendant que je râle.
Il a encore l'air assez vieux.
Trčs vieux, męme.
Poussez-vous, madame.
Comme pour tout,
le pompage est la forme
primitive du pliage.
Allez, Bender!
Pompe encore! Plus fort!
Je fais de mon mieux.
Plus fort, bon sang!
Quelle perte de temps.
Ca a marché!
Vous pourriez ętre mon pčre!
Crachat de caniche!
Cinquante-trois ans?
Il me faudra une fausse carte d'identité
pour l'ultra-porno.
C'est cool.
On devrait aller fęter ca!
Seigneur!
Vous ętes tous retournés en enfance!
Hourra! Je suis de nouveau
un jeune tombeur!
Pendant que j'essaie d'arranger ça,
allez au travail
comme des professionnels responsables.
C'est pas moi, c'est Amy.
- Arręte, Amy!
- Tu pues!
C'était toi!
Silence! Silence, j'ai dit!
On est venus chercher
mon petit bout de mari.
Hermes, dis au revoir ŕ M. Farnsworth.
Au revoir, M. Proutworth!
C'est l'occasion de voir mes parents.
Tes parents sont
de dégoűtants mutants des égouts.
Orpheline,
je voulais ętre avec mes parents.
Maintenant qu'on a été projetés
dans le passé...
Ce n'est pas le cas!
Tais-toi et retourne chez tes parents!
Ça va ętre super, maman!
On peut cuisiner,
se disputer sur ma coupe de cheveux.
Et si un gamin m'embęte,
papa se battra avec son pčre!
Je peux pas me battre avec le gamin?
D'accord, Leela.
Si tu penses pouvoir
supporter ton pčre, bienvenue.
On respectera ton indépendance.
Non!
Je veux une vraie expérience d'ado.
Corvées, couvre-feu, le grand jeu!
D'accord, ma puce,
on sera des parents trčs stricts.
Un peu de tequila pour fęter ça?
Je suis mineure!
C'est vrai. Voilŕ une paille.
BIENVENUE CHEZ LES WONG
Mon Amy est redevenue
une gentille petite fille.
Le ręve de toute mčre!
Un mauvais ręve. J'aurai jamais
de petits-enfants ŕ ce rythme-lŕ!
Elle est pas grande,
mais elle est grosse!
Si tu comptes te moquer de mon poids,
je reste dans ma chambre!
T'es si grosse
que tu remplis ta chambre!
Je dois me débarrasser
des ravages de la jeunesse.
Je vais aux toilettes
toutes les trois heures.
Ces cons de la sécu
ne me donnent plus d'argent.
Maintenant,
c'est moi qui leur en donne!
J'en ai marre de vos jacassements!
Vous ne faites
que vous plaindre sans agir.
Je quitte cette famille sans avenir.
Il y a un endroit pour ceux
qui ont de nouvelles idées.
- Y en a bien un, non?
- Vas-y.
Je pars et vous allez ętre lŕ:
"Oů est Bender? Il me manque!"
Pars et on verra.
- Je pars.
- Voici la porte.
Je serai sage.
T'es obligé de muer sur le canapé?
On vit dans un zoo ou quoi?
Je vais ouvrir.
C'est pour moi?
Bonsoir. Quelle soirée agréable.
Je viens pour votre fille.
Salut, Fry. Chouette veste.
Merci. Les poches sont cousues.
L'argent
est dans mes chaussettes.
Oů emmčnes-tu ma fille?
Voir un film.
Voir un film, madame.
Quoi que vous fassiez,
ne nous réveillez pas aprčs minuit.
Tu es trop indulgent.
Je dois rentrer avant 23 h.
D'accord! C'est toi le chef!
Non!
Je veux un Mac-égout
sans crottes de rats.
T'es au régime?
Leela, t'es canon.
Moose, jette-moi devant elle
tant que tu y es.
Moose, Mandy, voici mon ami Fry.
Il vient de la surface.
C'est donc le fameux Fry.
Il est si naze lŕ-haut
qu'il doit traîner avec ceux des égouts?
- Ils sont au courant!
- Allons.
Soyons un peu adultes.
- On fait la course?
- D'accord.
UN VIOLON SOUS LE TOIT
CA PUE UN MAX!

Voilŕ. L'eau est potable
pour quelques jours de plus.
Bordel!
GARDEZ NOS ÉGOUTS

Un ténia!
On a raté le virage!
On les rattrapera jamais.
Mais si. Cet égout passe
sous Planet Express et il est 21 h.
Que le diable emporte
ce côlon si prévisible!
Ouais!
Arręte, on a gagné maintenant.
J'atteins pas le frein!
2 heures de colle.
Et un ténia géant
a essayé de nous avoir,
mais on a pu semer Moose.
J'aimerais rencontrer ce Moose.
En attendant, bonne nouvelle!
J'ai résolu notre problčme d'âge.
Ce goudron jouvenceur était plein
de kronatons altérateurs de temps.
On en a une fine couche sur l'ADN
et sur l'"ARN" de Bender.
- Question.
- Oui?
Vous puez.
Oui, oui. J'ai créé
une bactérie mangeuse d'huile
qui devrait enlever le goudron.
On va chercher Leela
pour grandir ensemble.
Merci mais je ne veux pas
de traitement.
Tu comprends pas, crétine?
Si on te soigne pas rapidement,
tu ne retrouveras ton âge
qu'avec le temps,
comme Dieu le voulait.
Il a raison.
Pense ŕ ton travail et ŕ tes amis.
Tu veux vraiment abandonner ta vie?
Elle n'était pas aussi glamour
que sur mon site web.
J'ai toujours voulu grandir ici,
avec vous.
- S'il vous plaît?
- Si c'est ce que tu veux.
C'est ce que je veux.
Tu vas me manquer, Leela.
Je viendrai te voir
quand je serai grand.
- Avec de la bičre.
- Tu finis la tequila avant!
Les microbes
restaurateurs d'âge sont pręts.
Tous dans la chambre bactérienne.
Tout le monde pareil.
Infection contrôlée, commencée.
Je suis pas docteur,
mais ce type a besoin d'une pastille.
On est encore plus jeunes!
Les bactéries se sont goinfrées
de goudron
et maintenant elles répandent
des kronatons dans tout notre systčme!
On rajeunit ŕ chaque minute!
Je vais passer
par tous mes états de larve?
On va tous rajeunir encore et encore
jusqu'ŕ un destin pire que la mort:
L'avant-vie! Puis la mort.
JO YEUX ANNIVERSAIRE
Il faut arręter ca
avant qu'on se ratatine
et qu'on souffre de non-naissance!
Creuse-toi la tęte, disco man!
Qu'est-ce qui se tortille
sous votre chemise?
Va-t'en,
espčce de lamproie parasite!
Comme si t'avais besoin
de tout ton sang.
Relax.
Je peux pas réfléchir
si vous me cassez le groove.
Il me faut une baby-sitter.
C'est l'heure de se calmer.
Faites comme si un lutin avait mangé
votre langue et je vous lis une histoire.
Ouais, une histoire!
Je ne vois rien d'ici!
Voilŕ.
Aujourd'hui, on lit
Adomutant Magazine.
Vous préférez Chachi Quatre-jambes
ou Chachi Tentacules?
Une histoire de l'espace!
LÉGENDES SPATIALES
ENFANTINES
C'est pour les bébés, mais d'accord.
"Blanche-Neige naine
et les 7 nains rouges",
"Le Pičge des Tholiens de Charlotte",
"La Source de la vieillesse".
La Source de la vieillesse?
C'est qu'une légende.
On disait que le Pčre Noël était
une légende et il est chef du FBI!
Vous ętes pręts?
Le prof est lŕ!
Vous sentez la fumée.
Et l'alcool!
J'ai bu quelques bičres,
mais je peux conduire.
J'aimerais vous dire au revoir
avant que vous ne grandissiez,
mais je suis punie,
j'ai détruit l'école.
Peu importe!
C'était une école publique.
Va avec tes amis.
Je t'en prie.
Non. Un ado puni doit ętre
enfermé dans sa chambre!
Et il fait le mur.
Quand je serai grand,
je serai un bulldozer!
Apparemment,
la source se trouve dans la région
la plus ancienne de l'espace,
ŕ la jonction du Nounours.
La jonction du Nounours,
le trou de balle de la galaxie.
Ce systčme solaire est super vieux!
Regardez comme l'anneau
d'astéroďdes est haut!
Flash d'information:
Tout est plus vieux
ŕ l'approche de ce vieux soleil.
Mec, la Source de vieillesse
doit ętre sur le soleil lui-męme!
A fond! J'allais le dire.
Il faut faire vite.
Les gamins n'ont pas de couche.
Faisons trčs attention
ŕ rester juste le temps nécessaire
pour revenir ŕ notre vrai âge.
Zoidberg, sors de lŕ!
Le courant! C'est déjŕ trop tard!
A l'aide!
Nom d'une pipe!
- Zoidberg est mort!
- Non! Son frčre est mort.
Je suis ŕ l'âge oů mes frčres
ont commencé ŕ me pousser dessus
et mon frangin Norman a sauté
dans la source.
Il fallait toujours
qu'il fasse son intéressant!
Laissez-le partir.

PILES NON INCLUES
PROJET DE ROBOT
Vite! Dans la source!
Merci de ton aide, Leela.
Quand on sera grands,
tu pourras retourner dans ta famille.
On t'embętera plus.
Vous pouvez m'embęter un peu.
Ca marche! Hourra!
Je tiens plus!
Je viens vous chercher!
Non, Leela!
N'abandonne pas ton enfance.
Tu ne la retrouveras jamais!
Ça a marché! On a nos vrais âges!
Je crois bien
que j'ai 2 ans de moins!
Moi aussi!
Au secours!
Je suis encore en danger,
bande de crétins!
On peut pas l'atteindre!
Dans mon dernier soupir,
je maudis Zoidberg!
Pazoozoo!
Tu es revenu.
Vous avez retrouvé votre âge?
Encore plus vieux! Youpi!
Désolé que tu aies dű
abandonner ton enfance.
Je crois que tout adulte
voudrait parfois redevenir enfant.
Mais j'aime qui je suis devenue.
- Une personne super.
- Avec de tels amis.
Des amis super.
Je suis trčs contente
de retrouver ma vie.
Toi, mon ami fidčle, comment
pourrais-je jamais te remercier?
Voilŕ comment papa ŕ gagné sa liberté.
Maintenant...
A vous tous.

TU M'ÉTONNES!
Fry: Le pourquoi du comment
Livreur Philip J. Fry au rapport.
Dr Zoidberg au bain de mer.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire?
On a une livraison!
Amy, plan de mission.
Intéressant. Intéressant.
- Dr Zoidberg, sac de mission?
- Pręt, monsieur.
C'est la męme surprise
que la derničre fois!
Je peux pas travailler comme ça.
Sans moi, pas de mission.
- Je suis la mission.
- On revient de mission.
Quoi? Sans moi?
Tu cherchais des insultes
dans le dico.
- T'avais l'air d'avoir mieux ŕ faire.
- C'est moi le livreur.
- Tout s'est bien passé.
- Mieux que jamais.
On a eu une médaille.
Bon boulot.
On a fait une bonne équipe.
Ils ont eu une médaille.
Désolé de ne pas ętre venu.
- Vous aviez besoin de moi.
- Non.
- Si j'étais...
- Non!
- Ecoute...
- Non.
- Bender est génial.
- Non.
Laisse-moi me rattraper
en vous invitant ŕ dîner.
- Non, j'ai rendez-vous avec Chaz.
- Chaz?
Je l'ai connu ŕ un combat de coq.
Il est conseiller du maire.
Vas-y, mutante.
- J'y vais. C'est un homme important.
- Moi aussi je le suis.
C'est juste que mon importance,
on s'en moque.
Je ne suis personne.
Męme dans les bandes dessinées,
ils sont plus importants.
On se secoue, gros légume.
Bender va te sortir.
Tu veux faire quoi?
N'importe quoi, tu décides.
Dis et on fait. T'es le chef.
D'accord, allons au bowling.
Une table pour deux?
Par ici.
Nous n'avons pas réservé
mais comme vous voyez,
je suis le conseiller du maire.
Une table pour deux.
D'accord.
Pas de soucis,
je vous couvre
pour l'inspection d'hygične.
Merci, conseiller du maire. Tenez.
Cadeau de la maison.
Du pain gratuit! Y a-t-il une chose
qui vous soit impossible?
Décevoir le maire est impossible.
- Mince, je veux pas que Leela me voit.
- C'est Fry.
Cool que tu sois lŕ.
Ça marche pas avec Cékoi Sonom?
En fait, si.
Entre nous, je pense
que je rentrerai pas ce soir.
Tu peux sortir Nibbler?
Prends un sachet
au cas oů il fait un paquebot.
S'il te plaît, non!
Parfait.
Ca sent le 289.
Il n'a pas ramassé. Oh, ouais.
J'essaie mais ça pčse au moins
1000 soleils.
T'inquičte. Je tire deux, trois ficelles
et tu seras jugé ŕ la cour des mineurs.
Oh, Chaz.
Je ne vaux pas mieux
que cette poubelle.
Tu me crois aussi inutile que toi?
Essaie d'attraper les ordures
dans ta tęte et d'élever six enfants.
Je suis au moins important pour toi,
męme si c'est parce que
je ramasse tes crottes.
L'éradication des crottes
n'est qu'un aspect de ton importance.
- Tu as parlé?
- Oui,
et j'ai d'autres super pouvoirs.
Lesquels?
- T'es ma maman?
- Négatif.
DIMENSIONS INCONCEVABLES
CACHÉES
- Bienvenue, Lord Nibbler.
- Bienvenue recue.
Voici le Tout Puissant.
Nos sičcles d'attente
ont enfin porté leurs fruits.
Il est mignon tout plein!
Arręte!
S'il te plaît, Ta Grandeur.
"Grandeur"? Je suis kidnappé
par des singes de Guinée!
- Il ne sait pas?
- Non.
- Il sait pas?
- Sait pas il.
- Pas il sait?
- Assez!
J'ai le devoir de t'informer
que le destin de l'humanité,
celui de notre race,
de tout ce qui existe
et existera, repose sur toi.
Tu es la personne
la plus importante de l'univers.
Ca alors!
En cette occasion, que la corne
de l'éternité sonne un grand coup.
Que commence le festin
de milliers de bętes.
- Tu manges pas?
- Plus tard.
Le moment est venu de parler
de choses de haute importance.
Tu te rappelles
l'attaque de la Terre
par des cerveaux volants?
Je me souviens des estomacs dansants.
Ou c'était une pub.
Les cerveaux! Je me souviens,
mais personne ne m'avait cru.
Tu t'en souviens parce que
tu étais immunisé
contre l'attaque mentale.
Car je suis hyper intelligent?
Trop bon...
Ton immunité est due
ŕ un manque d'ondes cérébrales,
anomalie provoquée
par ton retour dans le temps
oů tu es devenu ton propre grand-pčre.
J'ai fait des bętises par le passé.
Ces bętises t'ont protégé
contre les cerveaux.
Tu es le dernier espoir de l'univers.
Je suis important?
Comme ce que je ressens bourré?
Oui, sauf que l'orchestre
de Dave Matthews n'est pas lŕ.
Pendant mille ans,
les cerveaux ont construit
l'info-sphčre, mémoire géante
deux fois plus grosse
que trois mémoires ordinaires.
- Oů est le mal?
- Ils vont stocker
toutes les informations
de l'univers dans la sphčre.
- Ils veulent apprendre?
- Oui.
- Les bâtards!
- En tant que cerveaux,
ils veulent tout savoir.
Bientôt, ils sauront tout.
- Je suis aussi énervé que d'habitude.
- Ensuite,
ils empęcheront
tout savoir d'émerger
en détruisant l'univers.
C'est entre eux et moi.
Tu dois infiltrer l'info-sphčre
et mettre cette bombe quantique
qui les projettera
dans l'univers du non retour.
Puis il faut que tu fuies
l'explosion sur le Juniorscout.
PRĘT POUR DU FUN
SANS DANGER?
Allez, on répčte depuis le début...
- Cerveaux!
- N'aie crainte, Tout Puissant.
Tes ondes manquantes
te rendent invisible.
- Tant que tu ne réfléchis pas trop.
- J'ai pas écouté.
- C'est plus sage.
- Qui?
Quelques secondes avant qu'ils aient
les derničres informations de l'univers.
Les castors restent ensemble ŕ vie.
Pour une moquette douce,
Moquettes St Matou!
COMPLETE AQUISITION
AUTO-SCAN
L 'info-sphčre va ouvrir sa croűte
pour se scanner elle-męme,
complétant sa tâche de mille ans.
C'est ta seule chance d'y rentrer.
Scoute!
Je suis aux commandes.
Je suis nerveux
et j'ai du cerveau dans le fut.
Reçu.
Une fois le détonateur enclenché,
tu auras 60 secondes pour partir.
Ce cerveau sait tout, non?
Bientôt. C'est pourquoi
tu dois mettre une bombe.
Je peux pas rater l'occasion de poser
les grandes questions de notre temps.
La colle des timbres est faite...
Correct, de bave de crapaud.
Pas le temps. Active la bombe.
Attendez. Qui a tué les dinosaures?
Moi!
Accčs non autorisé.
Trace d'activité mentale détectée.
Un hamster mort
ou un fan de dessins animés.
Arrętez.
Il est immunisé ŕ notre attaque.
Impossible. On est ambitieux
et on a tout ŕ prouver.
On est en présence du mec légendaire,
mais sans son scooter,
il ne peut pas s'échapper.
Une bombe quantique?
Ça va pas les neurones?
Tu as deviné, Poindexter.
Pas bon.
Détonation ŕ T moins 60 secondes.
Imbécile! Tu iras avec nous
dans l'autre univers.
Enfermé pour l'éternité.
On te mettra ŕ l'écart.
J'aurais au moins fait un truc bien,
combattre le mal par le bien.
- Ouais!
- Exact!
Les Nibbloniains sont bons?
Pour tes derniers instants ici,
pose une question
sur la nuit du 31 décembre 1999.
- Le jour de ma congélation? Quoi?
- Non.
Ne demande rien. C'est ennuyeux.
- Pas grave.
- Demande!
D'accord.
Que m'est-il arrivé
la nuit du 31 décembre 1999?
Précision. Tu es le Fry de la Terre
ou celui de Hovering Squid World 97 A?
De la Terre, triple idiot.
Dépęche-toi.
CRYOGÉNIE
SANS PROBLEME DEPUIS 1997
J'ai une pizza ŕ livrer pour
"M. Jean Bon"? Oh, crotte.
Qu'est-ce que j'étais gros.
C'est Nibbler. Quoi?
Qu'est-ce...
Je comprends pas. Tu m'as poussé
dans le tube de congélation?
Détonation dans T moins 15 secondes.
Vous m'avez congelé, bande d'avortons.
- On peut t'expliquer.
- Fermez vos jolies gueules.
Tu étais le seul ŕ pouvoir nous aider.
Une vie n'est rien
ŕ côté de l'univers tout entier.
Mais c'était ma vie.
Détonation dans 2, 1...
Le propriétaire de la Pontiac...
Peu importe, zéro!
Nous voilŕ enfermés pour l'éternité.
- Chantons "American Pie."
- Allez-y, je le mérite.
Si seulement ces ratons laveurs stupides
m'avaient laissé dans le passé.
J'ai des informations ŕ ce sujet.
On s'en fout, le naze.
C'est plus ton boulot
dans cet univers.
Philip Fry peut recommencer sa vie
ŕ partir du 31 décembre 1999.
Je peux retourner dans le temps?
Il y a une liaison entre les univers
ŕ l'espace-temps
oů tu es tombé dans le tube.
Tu es le seul ŕ pouvoir y retourner.
Intéressant. Tu pourrais empęcher
le Nibbloniain
de te pousser dans le tube.
Ça c'est intéressant. Pourquoi?
Ce sera comme si t'étais
jamais venu dans le futur.
Tu retrouveras ta vie et on réussira
ŕ comprendre et détruire l'univers.
- Tous gagnants.
- L'humain retourne dans la passé!
Pendant ce temps...
J'aime la fusée ŕ glace,
mais il faut faire la queue longtemps.
Une fois, Fry a attendu 6 heures
pour m'avoir un ticket.
Six heures? C'est personne ce gars.
Lŕ, il y a quelqu'un
avec une nana pour patiner.
FERMÉ
UTILISATION PRIVÉE
- T'as réservé la patinoire?
- Un coup de fil
en disant que le conseiller
du maire venait.
Oh, Chaz!
M. Vogel, on croyait qu'on allait patiner.
On n'est pas assez importants.
On attend que le chauffeur
revienne de chez le coiffeur.
- Laissons ces enfants patiner avec nous.
- Sérieusement?
- J'essaie de t'impressionner.
- Je sais et ca marche.
Ils doivent tant
avoir envie de patiner.
On n'a pas mangé pour pouvoir venir.
C'est leur seule chance de patiner ici.
- On est qui pour les en priver?
- Le conseiller.
Revenez quand vous aurez des relations.
Allez les petits,
retour ŕ l'orphelinat.
Vous patinerez en chaussettes.
Quelles chaussettes?
Alors, je vais arriver
ŕ mes fins ce soir?
Les calculs sont bons?
Nos calculs sont toujours bons,
on est des cerveaux géants.
Transfert espace-temps.
VIEUX NEW YORK
31 DÉCEMBRE 1999
Je veux commander
une pizza au fromage.
Une pizza avec rien de bon dessus.
Nom?
J.E.A. N BON.
Parlez plus fort.
On dirait que vous avez une petite tęte.
LABORATOIRE DE CRYOGÉNIE
J'ai une pizza ŕ livrer pour
"M. Jean Bon"? Oh, crotte.
Je t'ai eu!
- Je comprends pas.
- Mais si.
Tu es dans le passé
pour me cryogéniser,
je vais t'en empęcher.
Je suis pas revenu dans le passé.
Mais dans le futur,
je nettoie tes crottes.
Possible.
On vit vieux et on fait plein de crottes.
On se verra quand j'aurai 1000 ans.
Pas si tu me congčles pas.
Nos sages ont prévu que dans 1000 ans,
le destin de l'univers dépendra de toi.
Comme tu ne vivras pas jusque-lŕ,
je dois te congeler.
- Il fallait demander.
- On craignait un non.
Pourquoi, j'adore le futur.
Alors pourquoi m'étouffer?
J'aime pas qu'on m'utilise.
A toi de voir.
Rien ne vaut-il la peine dans le futur?
Leela, mais elle me prend pour un nul.
Ce doit ętre L'Autre.
Quoi?
Ne laisse pas tomber.
Je suis d'un monde lointain
appelé Virgon Six.
Si tu vas dans le futur,
j'irai sur Terre
pour t'aider.
- 10, 9, 8, 7...
- J'ai une chance avec Leela?
Tu dois choisir. Présent ou futur?
Te sauver toi ou sauver Leela.
Un!
1000 ANS
J'arrive, futur! Attends!
On va m'enfermer dans l'info-sphčre.
Souviens-toi
que ce Juniorscout est nul!
Dans 1000 ans, je monterai dessus.
1000 ans plus tard, Fry,
encore une fois,
infiltra l'info-sphčre
et posa ses super bombes.
Mais cette fois...
SENIORSCOUT
Merci d'avoir sauvé l'univers, Fry.
- Tiens.
- Merci.
Besoin d'un sauveur?
Je suis lŕ.
Ça viendra, ça viendra.
J'ai hâte de tout raconter.
Oui, mais il faut
que je reste sous couverture,
alors j'efface ta mémoire.
C'était bizarre pendant une seconde.
Allez, ŕ la maison, machine ŕ crotte.
- Bender, tu me fais l'honneur?
- Avec gusto.
Salut Leela. C'est pour toi, je crois.
Merci.
Je me moque que tu ne sois pas
le plus important de l'univers.
Je suis si contente de te voir.
Alors je suis
le plus important de l'univers.
Ouais!

UN DÉRIVÉ DE LA TÉLÉVISION
Le dard
Le silence envahit la foule.
On n'entend que les insultes que Bender
adresse à ses concurrents. Il swingue!
SCORE:
A L'EAU, GROS NUL
Et il slice... dans l'eau.
Non!
Ah, je te jure!
Mauvaise nouvelle: Vous n'êtes pas
assez bons pour la prochaine mission.
- Hourra!
- Pas assez bons!
- Pourquoi? Qui l'a dit?
- Parce que. C'est moi.
Ceux que j'avais choisis avant vous
y ont laissé la vie.
Et vous êtes loin d'être aussi bons.
On sera nuls un jour de plus!
On est aussi bons que tous ceux
que vous avez envoyés à la mort.
- Quelle est la mission?
- Aller chercher du miel.
- Cela n'a pas l'air terrible.
- Pas n'importe quel miel,
celui de violentes abeilles cosmiques.
Une piqûre et leur venin neurotoxique
provoque une mort subite.
Si vous n'êtes pas allergiques.
Sinon... mieux vaut ne pas savoir.
Vos entrailles jailliront de vos orbites
comme la lave d'un volcan.
Je ne voulais pas savoir!
Ces abeilles sont plus grosses
qu'une Buick et deux fois plus laides.
Plus grosses qu'une berline?
Quelle taille ont les alvéoles?
Elles sont grosses.
Oui, oh oui.
- Elles ne sont pas petites?
- Non, oh non.
Ce ne sont pas de simples abeilles
tueuses qui vont nous arrêter.
- On y va.
- Leela, on n'est pas assez bons.
Moi aussi, j'ai peur. Mais j'ai encore
plus peur de me décevoir moi-même.
Ça, ça ne me fait pas peur.
Les abeilles communiquent en dansant.
Comme mes parents.
Non, eux, ils se battaient.
Cette cartouche te permettra
de les distraire.
J'ai souvent des pensées
que l'on n'exprime que par la danse.
Tu pues.
Bender est génial.
Prends-le comme tu veux.
Bender, vite! Une danse.
Salut les amies.
Comment va l'abdomen?
Gorgé de nectar, j'imagine?
A ton avis?
Partons, Leela.
Il n'y a pas de honte à se dégonfler!
Du calme, tout ira bien.
Mon Dieu!
Le vaisseau de l'autre équipe.
Voici la boîte noire.
Capitaine! Nous sommes encerclés!
Le professeur disait vrai.
- Nous ne sommes pas assez bons.
- C'est ce qu'on va voir.
Ce ne sont pas de simples abeilles
tueuses... Oh mon Dieu!
On n'entend rien.
Trop d'électricité statique.
Enfin! Les alvéoles!
- Qu'est-ce que c'est?
- De la gelée royale, pour la reine.
Elles font du miel et de la gelée?
Pourquoi les humains
ne font rien de bon?
Je ne sais pas nager dans la gelée.
Du moins, je ne crois pas.
Regardez!
Une petite reine!
Elle est tellement mignonne!
Adorable petit chou, tout doux...
Arrête de bêtifier et partons.
J'ai de la gelée plein le slip.
Je l'emmène avec nous.
On peut construire une ruche.
La reine nous fera du miel.
Je lui prépare un goûter et on y va.
Accélère, petite dame.
J'en ai marre de me bouger
pour ces gros tas.
Je ne parlais pas de vous.
Seulement de cette grosse-là.
Il insulte notre Reine!
Allez garder la ligne
après 10000 naissances.
Au secours!
C'est là qu'on se distingue
de l'autre équipe.
Activation d'urgence
des modules de survie
à haute vitesse. Vite!
Bonne chance, Bender!
Me revoilà, chérie!
- On a réussi, on est en vie!
- Nulle, l'autre équipe.
Ils étaient plus nuls et ils sont
plus morts. C'est tout.
On a été chanceux.
Tu devrais être plus prudente.
- Je ne veux pas te perdre.
- Merci, mais je suis assez grande.
- Je sens le danger à 1 km à la ronde.
- Attention!
Tu la veux?
Il faudra me passer dessus.
Tu appelles ça une blessure?
Un simple bobo!
Merci d'avoir voulu me sauver, Fry.
Fry?
Il est...
Il est mort.
Qui va me faire
mes gaufres préférées?
LES PRAIRIES ORBITALES
A NOTRE CHER AMI ET LIVREUR
REPOSE EN PAIX, SAC A VIANDE
DE BENDER
Tout est de ma faute.
Il est mort à cause de moi.
Non, non, non, non, non, non.
Je mens pour qu'elle se sente mieux.
Tu ne peux aller nulle part
sans rien brûler?
Tradition comptable de Jamaïque:
C'est sa carte de pointage.
Ainsi son âme ne viendra pas
réclamer ses arriérés.
Il a l'air si naturel.
Dire qu'il est plein de sciure
et d'agents conservateurs.
J'aurais aimé pouvoir enlever le dard.
Je connaissais à peine Philip.
Mais le prêtre que je suis
peut dire à ses proches qui il était.
Apaise-nous de tes doux mensonges.
Cela vous consolera de savoir
qu'il est mort en 15 secondes.
Mais la douleur était telle
qu'elles lui ont paru durer 15 années.
Il va sans dire
que ses intestins se sont vidés.
Confions le corps de Fry
à la nuit des temps.
Il vole vers le soleil, désormais.
Voilà qui fait de moi
le plus vieux membre de la famille.
Lui bien faire snu-snu.
J'ai toujours dit: "Mort aux humains."
Mais je murmurais: "tous sauf un."
C'était Fry,
et je ne lui ai jamais dit!
Le monde de demain te dit adieu!
MIEL
On dit qu'une cuiller de miel cosmique
apaise la douleur.
SOUVENIRS DE FRY
C'est bon.
Je me sens drôle. Très drôle.
- Leela?
- Fry? Je te croyais mort.
Jamais senti aussi bien! Avant
l'accident, je ne pouvais pas faire ça.
Impressionnant. Mais ça confirme
mon idée que tu es mort.
Je vais te prouver le contraire
en te disant un secret.
Une surprise t'attend dans mon casier.
J'ai trouvé ca
dans une boutique de souvenirs.
Je n'ose pas l'ouvrir. Je peux?
Bien sûr. Je ne demande qu'une chose.
- Laquelle?
- Je veux que tu te réveilles.
Que je me réveille? Mais...
Dans mon rêve, Fry parlait
d'un cadeau dans son casier.
Si c'est vrai, c'est qu'il existe,
quelque part.
Bien sûr qu'il existe.
Un cadavre congelé dans l'espace.
Je me rends triste moi-même.
C'est le moment.
Que dalle.
Je me sens mieux.
J'ai vendu tous ses souvenirs,
ca aide à faire le deuil.
- Il n'y avait pas un cadeau pour moi?
- Non, rien du tout.
Jamais de la vie, Lucie.
Le voilà.
POUR: Leela
DE: Fry
- Tu l'as pris dans son casier?
- Il est mort.
Aucune loi ne me l'interdit.
Cela prouve que Fry vit
et qu'il me parle dans mes rêves.
Foutaises!
Allonge-toi, on va faire des tests.
Si Fry est en vie,
le cerveau de Leela peut agir
comme une planche oui-ja.
- C'est un scanner?
- En quelque sorte.
En France, on appelle ça une guillotine.
Vous ne pouvez pas m'examiner
sans me décapiter?
Si. Sans aucun problème.
Imaginez qu'on l'ait inhumé vivant!
- Vous savez, comme Julia Roberts.
- Je suppose qu'il est possible...
Je ne peux y croire.
Quoi? Il est en vie
dans une autre dimension?
Non! Ce Trucomètre dit qu'il est mort
et que rien ne le ramènera.
- Incroyable!
- Mais, mon rêve...
Votre science ne peut expliquer
comment j'ai su
- que le cadeau était dans le casier.
- Facile.
Il te l'a dit en mourant,
mais la peine t'a fait oublier.
Vous dites que je deviens folle?
Non, personne ne dit cela.
Mais je le pense sûrement très fort.
Leela, je vais te parler,
même si tu n'entends pas.
- Bla, bla, bla. Bla, bla, bla...
- Tais-toi, je t'entends!
Le professeur dit
que tu n'es qu'un rêve.
Un rêve pourrait-il t'emmener danser
dans un jardin vénusien?
Techniquement parlant, oui.
Mais c'est très gentil de ta part.
Que dis-tu d'une randonnée de minuit
dans les glaciers d'Hypérion?
CACAO MISS ORIENT
Fry, tu es forcément en vie.
Même dans mes rêves, je n'ai jamais
rien vu d'aussi romantique.
Prends ma veste.
Tu as l'air d'avoir froid.
Merci. Tout est si magnifique.
Je n'ai pas idée
du froid qu'il doit faire.
J'aimerais tant prouver
que tu es en vie.
Tu le peux, en te réveillant.
Non, ne dis pas ça! Tout est vrai.
Encore un rêve.
La veste que Fry portait
pour ses funérailles!
Mon rêve disait vrai, il est vivant.
Assez de vantardise!
Mon mec aussi est vivant.
Plus maintenant.
C'est mieux comme ca.
Fry est vivant. J'en ai la preuve!
- Quoi?
- C'est faux!
En Jamaïque, on est sceptique.
Bouge-toi le train et montre-nous ça.
Il m'a donné sa veste. Regardez.
Ce n'est pas sa veste.
La sienne était rouge.
C'est ta veste.
Verte, et pendue à ton cintre.
Mais Fry... sa veste...
A mon réveil, je la portais.
La culpabilité te joue des tours.
Tu dois te calmer.
Je suis très calme.
Tout va bien se passer, Leela.
- Quoi?
- Tout va bien se passer.
Je suis peut-être un peu nerveuse.
Un peu? Tu es plus dingue
que ma tante Rita, qui est dingue.
Je dois me calmer.
Je vais reprendre un peu de ce miel.
Tu as pris du miel cosmique?
Sois prudente, espèce d'imbécile!
Une cuiller pour te calmer,
deux cuillers pour t'endormir.
Mais à la troisième,
tu t'endormiras si profondément
que tu ne te réveilleras plus jamais.
- Jamais!
- Jamais!
MIEL
GELÉE RO YALE
Une cuiller pour me calmer.
Parfait, je me sens plutôt calme.
Deux cuillers pour m'endormir.
Toujours éveillée. Une cuiller de plus
ne peut pas me faire de mal.
Zut! Il me faut une éponge.
Fry, c'est toi? Pas besoin d'éponge.
Je colle, je suis nu...
J'ai raté un truc bien?
Incroyable. Le Trucomètre dit
que Fry a touché la gelée royale
dans la ruche cosmique,
y laissant une empreinte d'ADN.
En se renversant sur le canapé,
cet ADN a été en contact
avec des cheveux de Fry...
Et du sang! N'oubliez pas son sang.
C'est vrai, Bender, merci.
Les fluides
que Fry a laissés sur le canapé
ont permis à la gelée
de reconstituer son corps.
- Super!
- C'est génial!
Mon pote vit,
et ses cartes de crédit fonctionnent.
Allons picoler!
Je vous préviens,
j'ai l'alcool mauvais.
- Je suis si contente de pas t'avoir tué.
- Et moi donc!
Ca me rendait folle
de me sentir coupable.
- Tout va bien, maintenant.
- Pas tout à fait.
- Que veux-tu dire?
- Tu dois te réveiller.
Me réveiller? Oh, non!
C'est impossible!
Crotte!
Je craque. Dans mes rêves,
je suis heureuse, Fry est en vie.
Au réveil,
mon esprit me joue des tours.
- Du calme, Leela.
- Toute vie a ses soucis.
Inquiète-toi,
et t'en auras toute la vie.
- Tu chantais?
- Je te disais de ne pas t'inquiéter.
Je ne peux pas chanter.
Décision judiciaire.
Je vais trouver le cadavre de Fry
et le garder sous mon lit
pour être sûre qu'il est mort
et prouver mon bon sens.
Ce n'est qu'un simple cercueil
qui contient un ami,
mort à cause de moi.
Qu'est-ce qui... Que fais-je chez moi?
Tu as tué Fry!
Tu as tué Fry!
- Tu as tué Fry!
- Arrêtez!
Arrêtez!
Tu as tué Fry.
D'accord, je suis folle.
Mais pas assez pour ne pas le savoir.
Je ne me sens bien
que dans mes rêves, avec toi.
Trois cuillers
et je rêverai à tout jamais.
Une.
Deux.
Et voilà.
Adieu, monde éveillé.
Leela, non! Ecoute-moi!
Tu veux passer le reste de ta vie
comme un légume?
- J'ai essayé. Bonjour les escarres.
- Que puis-je faire?
- Bats-toi!
- Je ne peux pas.
Ma Leela n'abandonnait pas comme ça.
D'accord, je vais essayer.
Va-t-en!
Je ne sais pas si tu entends
mais j'ai quelque chose à te dire.
- Je t'aime.
- J'ai si peur, Fry.
- Je ne sais pas quoi faire.
- Réveille-toi, simplement.
- Réveille-toi.
- Je ne te comprends pas.
Réveille-toi.
S'il te plaît, réveille-toi, Leela.
- Fry, tu es vivant.
- Leela! Tu es réveillée!
Bien sûr. C'est toi qui me réveillais
sans cesse. Où suis-je?
A l'hôpital.
On t'y a amenée après la piqûre.
C'est toi que l'abeille a piqué.
Le dard m'a traversé,
tu as été empoisonnée.
J'ai récupéré la rate
d'un ancien motard.
Nom d'un paresseux saturnien,
elle est réveillée!
C'était le plus beau coma
que j'ai jamais vu!
Le toubib te croyait fichue.
- Combien de temps ai-je dormi?
- Deux semaines.
Fry ne t'as pas quittée un instant.
Il te parlait sans cesse.
Un vrai perroquet des mers.
Je pensais
qu'en entendant une voix amie,
ton esprit resterait sain.
- Qui sait si tu m'as entendu?
- Je t'ai entendu, Fry.
Je t'ai entendu.
- Tu devrais te doucher.
- Toi aussi.

MIEUX QU'UNE GRANDE CLAQUE
DANS LA GUEULE
Le bon, la boîte et l'ahuri
Bon sang! A l'aide!
Je sais que tu m'as déjà
souvent repoussé,
mais nous sommes faits
l'un pour l'autre.
- Alors, on sort ce soir?
- Désolée, mais je crois que...
mon grille-pain est resté branché.
Bouddha! Zeus! Dieu!
Que l'un de vous réagisse!
Allez, Leela.
Donne-moi ta vraie raison.
A l'aide, Satan! Tu me le dois bien.
C'est embarrassant,
mais tu me forces à te le dire.
Je ne peux pas sortir avec toi,
- car j'ai des mycoses aux pieds.
- Sans blague!
Pourquoi crois-tu que je reste
dans la zone sans odeur?
Alors tu sors avec moi?
Bonne nouvelle!
Je suis techniquement encore en vie.
Mais je dois détruire
cette folle expérience
qui a failli me tuer.
Vous devrez la jeter dans le soleil,
car seule
sa chaleur nucléaire infernale
est assez puissante
pour la détruire totalement.
- Et en utilisant une pelle?
- Insuffisant.
J'ai déjà réussi à enfoncer
un type dans le sol avec une pelle.
- Qu'y a-t-il dans cette boîte?
- On ne regarde pas!
J'ignore ce que c'est.
Mais je suis sûr
que nous ne le comprendrions pas.
- Mon collationneur!
- Je m'en fiche.
Ecoutez-moi bien.
Quoi qu'il arrive,
aussi curieux que vous soyez,
ne regardez jamais dans cette boîte.
Jamais!
C'est pourtant très tentant.
C'est ce que j'ai toujours désiré.
Les boîtes sont souvent vides,
ou avec du fromage sous le couvercle.
Et une fois, du pepperoni.
C'était un grand jour.
Donnez-la-moi!
Dégagez, sales serpents verts!
Voilà. Sers-toi de ca
pour les descendre.
- Oui, s'ils essaient de regarder.
- Ou pas.
Oublions cette boîte.
Le professeur nous l'a dit.
Comment peux-tu être aussi naïf?
Il plaisantait. Tu captes?
- Non.
- C'est pour ça que c'est marrant.
Bon, il plaisantait pas.
Tais-toi et suis-moi.
VAPEUR SURCHAUFFÉE
DÉFENSE DE RAMPER
Il fait chaud!
Le beurre dans ma poche fond.
Merci, Bender, pour le cadeau
que nous allons recevoir.
Une guirlande emmêlée
pour jouer à la démêler!
De l'alcool sans marque.
Le bonheur!
Ça devrait les occuper.
Je peux garder la vraie boîte,
ils ne la chercheront plus.
L 'ENQUÊTEUR
BIGFOOT A 80 ANS!
Toute une nuit
sans que personne ne regarde.
Pas même moi, qui ai sacrifié
ma soirée pour la surveiller.
Une soirée de télé perdue!
Quelle ironie du sort
que je ne puisse même pas
y jeter un œil. Il me faut un café.
NOUVEAU POULET COSTAUD!
Face je regarde,
pile je ne regarde pas.
Oui! Face!
Je veux dire: "Bien."
C'est mon devoir de ne pas regarder.
D'un autre côté,
je l'ai promis à la pièce.
C'est profond,
plus qu'une petite boîte.
Je ne manquerai pas
d'en parler à mon avocat!
Qu'as-tu fait?
Rien.
Je n'ai pas regardé dans la boîte.
Non, tes cheveux. Ils ont changé.
- Bender? C'est toi?
- Tu me connais. Beau et responsable.
Ça, c'est bien une femme.
Se faire une couleur
au lieu de protéger la boîte.
Mes cheveux ont toujours été comme ça.
Ils ont toujours été comme ça.
Cela remet en cause
toute ma perception de la réalité.
Clone? Robot? Jumelle ignorée?
Je prends les paris.
J'offre un jeu de poker vidéo.
C'est un type en costume de Leela!
Attrapons-le.
Attendez, vous ne comprenez pas.
Je suis tombée dans la boîte
jusqu'ici.
- La ferme, monsieur!
- Non. J'ai compris.
Tout est dans la boîte.
J'ai été aussi bête que Fry.
- Je ne le suis pas.
- Elle renferme un univers parallèle.
Un univers parallèle est
presque toujours peuplé
de jumeaux diaboliques.
Je ne suis pas diabolique.
Mon comptable me l'a dit.
Tu voudrais qu'on te croie, Leela.
Ou devrais-je dire "Diabla"?
C'est horrible. Il existe un Bender
plus diabolique que moi.
Je fais de mon mieux.
Leela? La vraie Leela.
Va découvrir, dans l'autre univers,
leur degré de diabolisme.
- Tiens.
- Ils ne sont pas diaboliques.
Mais ce sont bien des crétins.
Salut.
Sortez de là les mains en l'air.
On dirait le trip d'un film
que j'ai vu en plein trip.
Epoustouflant!
- J'ai créé un univers parallèle.
- Baratin de chauve. C'est plutôt moi.
Tu n'as créé que mon poing
parallèle à ta tronche.
Peu importe qui a créé quoi.
Ce qui compte, c'est...
C'est mon double.
Je connais ses coups.
J'ai donc l'avantage.
La violence parfaitement symétrique
n'a jamais rien résolu.
Récapitulons les événements.
J'ai donc accidentellement créé
une boîte renfermant votre univers.
Dans une gaffe simultanée, j'ai créé
une boîte renfermant votre univers.
Ça devient compliqué.
Notre univers sera "l'univers A"
et celui-ci "l'univers B".
Et pourquoi on serait pas "l'univers A"?
Nous voulons le A.
C'était notre idée.
Et cet endroit fait plutôt "B".
Soyez donc le minable "univers A".
Nous serons "l'univers 1".
Ou "Les mangoustes". Ça sonne bien,
"Les braves mangoustes".
Attendez.
Si nous sommes identiques,
pourquoi notre Leela a-t-elle regardé
et pas la vôtre?
J'ai tiré à pile ou face.
C'était pile, je n'ai pas regardé.
Bizarre.
Moi c'était face, j'ai regardé.
Intéressant. La différence-clé
entre nos deux univers
serait le résultat de pile ou face.
Ça explique celui-là.
J'ai tiré à pile ou face pour ma finition.
- Gris brouillard.
- Tu veux goûter mon poing doré?
Vous et vos petites différences
me dégoûtez. Je rentre.
Où est cette boîte bleue
avec notre univers?
Tu veux retourner
dans ton univers diabolique
détruire la boîte
qui contient le nôtre.
C'est faux. Je ne ferai jamais ça.
Sauf si tu prévois d'en faire autant.
- Quoi?
- Parfaitement.
Quoi qu'il en soit,
la boîte restera cachée
jusqu'à preuve de votre bonté.
Gardez tous un œil sur votre double.
Même chose pour vous.
Puis-je le faire avec Fry?
Nous dînons ensemble.
- Vous sortez ensemble?
- Non, nous sommes mariés.
Je garde un œil sur toi.
Et moi donc, boîte-repas!
Au moindre truc louche, je te lamine.
C'est vrai. Allons dans
un club de strip-tease.
J'attendais que tu le proposes.
Bender A, tu es le prince des robots.
Tu pardonnes ma méfiance?
Je ne peux pas en vouloir
à mon caractère. Je m'adore.
C'est génial. J'ai toujours voulu
avoir une amie imaginaire.
Pas imaginaire, parallèle.
On est identiques jusqu'aux...
C'est du vernis rose?
C'est du vernis pas rose?
Le professeur a raison.
Tu es diabolique et superficielle.
C'est faux.
LA MONTAGNE DE GOULASCH
A VOLONTÉ POUR 19,95 $
Comment êtes-vous sortis ensemble?
C'est plutôt marrant.
Je l'invitais et elle refusait.
J'inventais des excuses,
une mycose aux pieds,
un dîner avec le président...
Des excuses énormes.
Mais, pauvre andouille, je la croyais.
Avec le recul, c'est assez marrant.
C'est sûr. N'est-ce pas, Leela?
Un soir, à court d'idées,
ma seule excuse était un fantôme.
Ça n'était pas crédible.
Alors, comme toujours...
- Mon Dieu.
- J'ai tiré à pile ou face.
C'était face et j'ai accepté.
Tu as fait pareil?
Et c'était pile?
Et tu m'avais parlé d'un fantôme.
Tu as manqué quelque chose.
C'était magique.
Un an après, je lui offrais un chouchou
en diamants et on se mariait.
Et moi, un an après,
je me faisais tabassé
par un mec appelé Chouchou.
C'est inutile.
Ne me trouve pas trop "diabolique",
mais d'où vient cette cicatrice?
Ce vieux truc? D'une expérience
pour transplanter mon propre cerveau.
Bien sûr! J'ai eu la même idée.
J'ai tiré à pile ou face.
Mais c'est tombé sur pile.
C'était comment?
Enlever le cerveau, c'était facile.
Le plus dur,
ca a été d'enlever le cerveau.
Sacré toi!
Parle-moi de toi.
Ne te renseigne pas trop,
mais je suis un médecin respecté.
Une boîte!
Moi, je dessine des manoirs
que j'habite ensuite.
C'est un mensonge.
Je suis un effroyable raté.
Moi aussi. Un raté tout gras.
Et ces collègues qui nous méprisent,
nous les Zoidberg.
Ils sont du Mont Aristo?
"Arrête de me couvrir d'encre,
Zoidberg!"
"Mets un pantalon, Zoidberg!"
"Ne touche pas la belle boîte."
Une boîte trop bien pour nous.
Un jour,
ils seront au fond du caniveau
alors que le roi Zoidberg
caressera leur boîte.
Peut-être qu'un homard bleu sait
où est cachée la boîte.
- Bonne nouvelle!
- Après examen des textes sacrés,
personne n'est diabolique.
La Bible,
c'est la vraie bonne nouvelle.
Tout le monde est donc libre
de rejoindre son univers.
Que se passe-t-il? Vous n'êtes pas
tous partis détruire la boîte?
Tu n'es pas étonné
de nous voir tous en double?
Non. Mais comme disait Grand-mère
dans sa cabane en Jamaïque,
"Si la boîte doit aller au soleil,
- apporte-la toi-même."
- Au diable Grand-mère!
J'ai caché la boîte
pour protéger l'univers
- de mon bel ami.
- Arrête.
Attends. Si ton Hermes
s'apprêtait à détruire la boîte
- contenant notre univers...
- Alors ton Hermes...
Bon sang!
Et bien entendu...
Grand-mère disait:
"Si la boîte doit aller au soleil,
apporte-la toi-même."
Que Dieu préserve ses os de zombie.
Nous devons sauter dans la boîte.
Oui. Le professeur B l'a cachée
dans cet aquarium à cœlacanthe.
Seul un homard fou la chercherait là.
Elle n'y est plus!
Gloire à Zoidberg,
le roi de la boîte.
- A mon tour, maintenant?
- La boîte dit non.
Pendant ce temps, dans l'univers A,
Hermes A se dirige vers le soleil...
A.
PROTOCOLE
Objet 1, la boîte. C'est bon.
Objet 2, le soleil.
C'est très bon.
Connaissant mon double,
il est arrivé.
Notre univers est anéanti.
Anéanti!
Ne désespérez pas, pleurnichards.
Il nous reste
un petit espoir ridicule.
- Une laque pour les cheveux?
- Non.
Nous devons construire
une boîte contenant notre univers.
- C'est ton univers?
- Non. Trop froid.
Que des femmes.
Je la garde pour plus tard.
C'est sans espoir.
Nous ne la trouverons jamais à temps.
Et cette boîte me colle à la tête.
Oui, c'est l'apocalypse.
Je savais que j'y jouerais un rôle.
Je ne suis pas triste,
un autre est aussi bien que moi.
C'est ma devise: Se faire des amis
en gardant les anciens.
- L'un en argent...
- Et l'autre en or.
Pourquoi ces têtes?
- Les idiots ont la boîte!
- C'est pour toi, ça.
Attrapez-les!
Trouillard! Attends-moi!
Dans lequel sont-ils?
C'est certainement en se le demandant
qu'on va trouver.
Chacun devra explorer un univers.
Prenez tous un câble
pour pouvoir retrouver votre chemin.
Avez-vous vu deux homards puants?
Nous n'avons rien vu.
Jamais.
- Avez-vous vu passer deux crustacés?
- Non.
- La ferme!
- Dégage, minable!
Les robots, avez-vous vu
d'autres Zoidberg par ici?
- Négatif. On sort, ce soir?
- Accès refusé.
Mec, regarde ce que j'ai piqué
dans l'univers Farfadet.
L'univers Farfadet, c'est cool,
si tu ne connais pas l'univers Pirate.
Sacrebleu!
Vite, une autre boîte!
Il n'y en a pas ici.
Toi!
- Et les boîtes?
- Elles sont quelque part.
Tout est quelque part.
Cet endroit est au naturel.
Les voilà!
Je l'ai!
C'est vraiment dingue de vous voir
vous battre pour cette boîte.
Elle renferme tout un univers.
Chacun de nous renferme un univers.
Ça roule, Professeur Freaksworth!
Travaillez!
Nous avons la boîte.
Tirez sur vos câbles.
Vite! Dans l'univers A!
N'appuie pas sur ce bouton!
- Au revoir.
- A bientôt.
A bientôt, Votre Majesté.
C'est nous, à un pile ou face près.
Comme l'univers n'a pas été détruit,
tu veux aller voir un combat
de singes? Ensemble?
Tu mérites bien un autre tirage.
- Pile ou face?
- Disons que c'est face.
Prêt? Un.
Deux. Trois. Tire!
Cette éversion d'espace-temps
nous a donné leur boîte et vice versa.
Vous pensiez nous expliquer que...
C'est ca.
Cette boîte contient notre univers.
Petite abeille d'infini.
Bender, tu détruis l'univers!
Mais...
Tout ce qui est et sera
est contenu dans cette boîte.
Et cette boîte vaut sûrement
quelque chose en elle-même.
Nous devons la chérir
comme chaque instant de notre vie.

ÉLU "MEILLEUR"
La cagnotte de la soie
Cette semaine dans l'univers
Nouvelles de Tarantulon 6.
Les braves soldats
commandés par
le général Webelo Zapp Brannigan
ont défait
le monde des araignées.
Aux victorieux revient le butin:
Un billion de dollars
de soie précieuse.
Chers Terriens, après avoir rencontré
de grands économistes vaudou,
j'ai décidé de vous reverser
l'excédent de soie.
Je vous ai envoyé chacun 300 bollars
sous forme d'un billet attrape-Dick.
Eclatez-vous!
SCEAU DU PRÉSIDENT
Je suis un peu plus riche.
Que faire, que faire?
Une passe à 300 $
ou 300 passes à 1 $?
Je vais nager avec
les baleines.
- Les gentils géants des profondeurs.
- Je sais bien.
Pour Scruffy, ce sera
une coupe de cheveux à 300 $.
Celle-ci a perdu son panache.
C'est une fortune.
Zoidberg va enfin vivre
comme un homme riche.
Arrêtez! Allez-vous en!
Laissez-moi!
Seulement 300 $.
Ça fait quoi, 100 tasses de café?
C'est ça! Je vais prendre 100 cafés,
dès maintenant.
Machine à café,
un café!
Ca sent bon.
- Leela, tu es là?
- Non.
Si. Je t'invite,
toi et tes collègues loufoques,
à une réception spéciale
pour présenter l'excédent de soie.
Tu dois connaître l'étalon
qui l'a trouvé.
Montre-leur ma médaille, Kif.
Il l'a louée avec ses 300 dollars.
Alors, Leela, me feras-tu ce plaisir?
Comme si c'était fait.
Alors demain, 20 h.
Bisous!
TOUT A 99 c
TOUT A 299,99 $
Adieu, les fumeries bon marché!
MANOIR DU CRACK
Merci, Monsieur. Dois-je
préchauffer la pipe de Monsieur?
Kif, c'est si romantique d'avoir loué
cet avion à pédales. Nous sommes
2 pissenlits
flottant dans la brise.
Oui. Pissenlits. Flottant.
J'ai presque honte de m'être offert
ce tatouage parlant.
Je coûte aussi cher
que ce rendez-vous minable.
La ferme!
Ca devient une véritable corvée
de nettoyer mes rides.
Les cellules souches
arrêtent-elles le vieillissement?
Oui, comme un bébé
arrêterait Mohammed Ali...
Une livre de cellules souches!
Tout effet de rajeunissement
est purement temporaire.
LES CIGARES FINS DE HACKING JACK
DERRIERES HOLLANDAIS
1,99 $
ZUBANS FINS
25 $
KOOPARILLO RO YAL
300 $
Le Grand Cigare
10000 $
Mec, pourquoi ce Grand Cigare
est-il si cher?
Comme on le voit,
il fut roulé dans le papier
de la Constitution
par la Reine Elizabeth
pendant ses années de débauche
et fut enterré avec George Burns
jusqu'à son vol...
Vous savez bien.
- Pour 300 $.
- Impossible.
Bon. Alors je prends juste
les outils de cambriolage pour 300 $.
Très bien, Monsieur.
Vous fermez à quelle heure, ce soir?
Papa! Tu as eu
ton exonération fiscale?
Eue et dépensée.
Tu es le propriétaire
de ces échasses Boogie!
Avec un tel avertissement,
on ne peut que s'amuser.
Je ne veux pas m'amuser.
Je veux être comme toi,
ennuyeux et prudent.
Cloches de Babylone!
J'ai dépensé presque 300 bananes
pour ça.
- Mets-les et amuse-toi.
- Pas question!
C'est moi qui les mets
et tu me regardes m'amuser.
M'amuser...
- Dwight! Au secours!
- Je vais te sauver!
Que cette fichue musique...
Continue.
- Marrant?
- Plutôt avoir 2 mamans.
DIAMANTS ÉTERNELS
LIQUIDATION
Essayez ceci, Monsieur.
Je demande des trucs de riche
et j'ai des cailloux brillants.
Je vous salue bien bas.
Aquarium de Brooklyn
ICI POISSON
Je voudrais nager avec Mushu.
Ça tombe bien,
je suis biologiste marin.
Mais moi, je déteste les baleines.
Surtout Mushu.
Alors pourquoi ce métier?
Je ne vous connais pas assez
pour en parler. 300 $.
Demain, midi. Un retard
et vous nagez avec les mollusques.
STARFISHBUCKS
CAFÉ
Je voudrais un café.
- Guppy, truite, sirène?
- Baleine.
Amy, je t'ai aussi acheté un cadeau.
Kify!
Ça donne l'heure où que nous soyons
et ca fonctionne à l'amour.
Il faut la remonter.
- On a gagné le jackpot.
- La ferme!
Je l'adore. Je m'en servirai
pour avoir l'heure.
Fry et Leela.
Pédale! Bon sang, pédale!
Au revoir, Fry et Leela!
Vivement que ses tatouages fessiers
entendent ca.
- Entendent quoi?
- Raconte-nous!
Ne sois pas triste, mon petit têtard.
J'essaie.
Mais mon cadeau
est dans le ventre d'une baleine.
Comme quand j'avais avalé
la montre qu'il t'avait offerte.
- C'est à peu près pareil.
- Il faut vomir.
C'était ça, la solution.
J'en ai mis partout.
Quelle super Saint Valentin!
C'est une grosse coïncidence,
mais je dois voir la baleine.
Scruffy a un plan,
mais il te faut
du poisson pourri tout prêt.
Chez Elzar
CARPE BOUILLIE
- Encore du café, Monsieur?
- Oui.
Posez ça. Dégagez!
Tu es si jeune d'esprit,
tu ne fais pas tes 25 ans.
Il suffit de croquer la vie,
comme si chaque jour était le dernier.
- C'est choisi, les enfants?
- Un saladier de farine douce.
CHAMPAGNE -
PRODUIT VAISSELLE - SAUCISSE
POISSON FRAIS
Génial.
Voici, dépensier.
Foie gras et caviar.
Du foie d'oie. Des œufs de poisson.
Où est l'oie, où est le poisson?
C'est ce que les riches mangent,
des déchets.
J'ai mangé des déchets hier,
mais par pour 300 $.
Je ne paierai pas. Bien le bonsoir.
Le Grand Cigare, il est à moi.
Et sans aucune conséquence.
- Tu as vu ca?
- Tabac Grand-vol.
Il est temps de bouger
nos gros derrières de flics.
C'est trop pourri,
même pour du jambalaya.
Jusqu'ici tout va bien.
Où est Kif?
LA GOUTTE MARRON
Café Gourmet
J'avais demandé du yéménite,
pas du sulawesi.
Et ma tasse tremble, pas de ça!
Tu as l'air un peu tendu
et ton visage est tout gras.
- Tu n'as pas dormi?
- Non.
Une insomnie. Je pensais au café.
Je m'endors.
Pause café!
- De la fine fumette.
- Super cigare.
Fume-le là!
Puff, puff! Allez!
On ne crache pas
cette fumée majestueuse
vers n'importe qui.
Je le garde pour la réception
de Zapp Brannigan.
Tu viens?
Cinquièmement,
les baleines tuent par plaisir.
- C'est tout?
- Vous êtes grosse et vous puez.
Je dis ce que je pense,
je suis un biologiste marin.
C'est l'heure de manger, Mushu.
NE PAS NOURRIR LA BALEINE
- Zut. Elle a mangé mon maillot.
- Il était moche. Biologiste marin.
- Serrez le manche, Monsieur.
- Merci, esclave de golf.
Une perte de temps,
pas pour les riches.
Et ces œufs sont grumeleux
et sans goût.
Pas si fort!
Mesdames et messieurs,
voici Mushu,
une baleine éduquée
qui se croit supérieure.
Allez, Mushu, vomis comme un bizut!
Bande d'ignorants,
nous allons voir qui
la fait sauter dans le cerceau.
Saute, Mushu.
Qui veut son poisson?
Mushu est triste.
Ça ne s'arrête pas.
RECHERCHÉ
Attends. Elle s'étrangle.
C'est la montre.
Je l'ai, Amy.
- Les doigts...
- Propriété de l'aquarium. Arrêtez-le.
Nous devrions faire ce qu'il dit.
C'est un biologiste marin.
Vous êtes en état d'arrestation.
TRÉSORS DE L'EX CÉDENT DE SOIE
FERMÉ POUR RÉCEPTION PRIVÉE
Les Araigniens sont faibles
et peu courageux,
mais maîtrisent l'art textile.
Ils ont goût de crabe.
Ces insectes fous tissaient
cette tapisserie me représentant
alors même que je les tuais.
Quoi? Ça ne sent même pas.
Mais si ça plaît aux riches,
je l'achète. Une œuvre pour moi!
Quelle brillante incarnation
d'un stupide pauvre.
Combien cela vaut-il, Brannigan?
- Exactement 1 milliard de dollars.
- Une bagatelle.
Comment?
Alors je dis à Kitty:
"La seule manière de le garder ici,
c'est de lui couper les pieds."
Ça me rappelle une blague
sur les petits bourgeois.
Je n'avais jamais
été triste à une fête.
Mon esprit pense-t-il à Kif
en prison?
On y fait de la sangria
dans les toilettes.
- Bien sûr, c'est "marche ou crève".
- Bien sûr.
ÎLE DU COMMANDANT RIKER
Rends-nous notre bien
et tu seras libre.
Bien. La voilà.
Elle est cassée, de toutes façons.
Je veux pas ta montre,
mais le précieux ambre gris.
Précieux hamburger?
"Ambre gris." Nom.
Concrétion intestinale de la baleine
utilisée en parfumerie.
C'était Roseanne,
votre guide dans le monde des faits.
Tu l'as entendue.
Donne-moi l'ambre et tu es libre.
Ou mieux,
je change de peau.
Arrête, ça va.
Je vais t'anéantir.
PYJAMA RO YAL OU PRESQUE
Je dois y aller. Fight club.
Que t'arrive-t-il?
Le visage dont tu es tombée amoureuse
n'était qu'un morceau de chair
payé avec mon billet.
Puisqu'on se parle franchement,
je l'ai aussi dépensé
dans un traitement fou.
C'est plutôt franc.
Nous ferions mieux
de rester nous-mêmes.
- Toi, ridé comme une prune.
- Toi, grosse comme un lamantin.
Je t'aime.
Bon sang!
Donc cette substance putride
- sur moi était...
- De l'ambre gris?
Oui. Et j'ai pu en voler un peu.
A partir de ça, je vais te créer un parfum
au lilas, au jasmin et à la franken-boise.
C'est si romantique.
Je ne peux pas attendre.
Je vais le porter dès maintenant.
- Qui sent le marsouin?
- C'est moi.
Embrasse-moi, Kif.
SORTIE DE SECOURS
J'ai été un stupide encornet.
Je ne suis pas riche. Je ne peux
même pas m'offrir une œuvre minable.
Excusez-nous. Deux clochards affamés
peuvent-ils se servir
dans cette boîte?
Je suis désormais dans les poubelles,
avec des mangeurs de détritus.
L'argent n'a pas fait mon bonheur.
Il reste du pudding sur la semelle!
SOIE TRES INFLAMMABLE
Les Araigniens
sont plus proches de nos éléphants
que de nos araignées.
Ne faites pas attention.
Y a le butin qui flambe!
Leela, ma précieuse colombe,
je vais te sauver.
- Tous vers la sortie de secours!
- Elle est en feu!
Nous sommes piégés,
mon doux hippopotame.
Café, café!
- Où sommes-nous?
- Et la nourriture?
Un mystérieux homme orange
nous a sauvés.
Bienvenue à tous!
Cet argent m'a enfin rendu heureux:
J'ai payé un festin
à mes amis affamés.
Hourra!
Joignez-vous à nous. L'huître
Rockefeller paye les hot-dogs.
On n'est jamais trop riche
pour un hot-dog gratuit.
- Oui.
- Allez! Hot-dog!
- J'en veux quatre.
- Moi, deux.
Peu importe.
36 SAUCISSES
Tiens, Dwight.
Les échasses ne coûtent que 299,99 $.
- Le cent restant est pour toi.
- Merci.
Je vais acheter 5 actions d'Amazon. Com.
Une tête brûlée.
C'est bien mon fils.
Tout l'excédent est perdu.
J'ai été un vrai McGovern.
Pourquoi vous avoir fait ce cadeau?
Il a donné
plusieurs histoires intéressantes.
Ça, oui!
Mon histoire a tourné court
sans que j'en tire une leçon.
Le voilà!
D'accord. C'est la conclusion!
"Futurama." Nom.
Tu viens de le regarder, crétin.
Tu me demandes quoi?
J'ai une définition marrante.
"Idiot." Nom.
Toi!
C'était Roseanne,
votre guide dans le monde des faits.

La trompe humaine
FORÊT NATIONALE
DURAFLAME
Mon Dieu. La randonnée fait toujours
aussi mal aux fesses.
- C'était quoi?
- Pas un nid d'oiseau qui tombe.
Ca fait ca:
- C'est si mignon quand ça a peur.
- Je parlais de Bigfoot.
Il a été vu par ici la semaine dernière.
Un aveugle l'a senti.
Ne me dis pas que tu crois au Bigfoot,
sale crétin de blablateur.
Bien sûr que si. C'est mon héros.
Enfant, c'était ma célébrité préférée.
- Pourquoi?
- C'était un solitaire fuyant
la popularité
tout en essayant d'en avoir.
Je m'identifie tellement à ca.
Assez d'émotions.
Ce n'est pas le Club Med, bon Dieu.
Même si ça ne saute pas aux yeux.
Si tu veux dormir dans la tente,
rejoins-nous, moi et Hermes,
pour de petites papouilles "entre amis".
Non, c'est confortable ici
à la belle étoile.
Vraiment confortable.
POSTE
FORESTIER
- Je suis Ranger Park, le ranger du parc.
- J'ai compris.
Comme c'est une réserve de Bigfoot,
voici un film sur Bigfoot
pendant que je passe quelques appels.
Bigfoot. Un mystère en danger.
Dans les denses forêts
du Pacific Northwest,
vit l'étrange et superbe Bigfoot,
peut-être.
- C'est la preuve.
- Malheureusement, l'homme
menace aujourd'hui son possible habitat.
Quoique non, si ce n 'est pas le cas.
La population Bigfoot a besoin d'espace
pour pouvoir se cacher.
Ils vivent surtout derrière les rochers,
mais sont aussi joueurs,
se cachant dans les brumes épaisses
et les zones floues.
On doit lire
"A Vendre Exercycle en Bon Etat."
Tu pourrais mettre "Bon Etat" en gras?
Non? Ok, oublie.
N'oubliez pas, ça dépend de nous.
Bigfoot est crucial à l'écosystème,
s 'il existe.
Donc, faisons tout pour qu'il survive,
pour la joie des générations futures,
à moins qu'il n 'existe pas.
Fin!
Je te rappelle.
Des questions?
- Oui. Vous avez déjà vu un Bigfoot?
- A vrai dire, non.
Mais je le vois chaque nuit en rêve
et chaque jour
sur le visage souriant des enfants.
Bobards! Apportez-moi un sac rempli
de crottes de Bigfoot ou fermez-la.
J'ai celles d'un gars qui l'a vu.
- La ferme.
- Regardez, c'est Bigfoot.
- Où ca?
- Oh, il est plus là.
Mais il a dit que vous devriez continuer
à gâcher votre vie.
J'ai vu un Bigfoot écraser des voitures
à la foire.
C'était Bigfoot, le monster truck.
Mais merci pour la super question.
Pourquoi ne pas installer
un milliard de caméras vidéo
dans les bois afin de l'apercevoir?
Ce serait très cher
et ceux qui croient en Bigfoot
sont fauchés.
Regardez! Bigfoot est revenu.
- Où?
- Dans ton cul.
Tout le monde fait le Bender.
Le ciel est formidable par ici.
Regarde tous ces satellites.
MANGEZ Bachelor Chow
Buvez SHIZ!

- Bonne nuit.
- Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit, Hubert.
- Tout va bien, mon pote?
- Mieux que ces moucherons.
Celui-là reverra pas ses gosses.
C'était quoi? Un loup?
Ou un autre genre de créature?
Dieu que j'aimerais être en sécurité
sous une tente.
Fry. Réveille-toi.
C'est moi, Bigface.
Viens panser ma fourrure miteuse.
Bigfoot? Tu as appris l'anglais?
Bigfoot. Bigfoot!
Bigfoot? C'est toi?
Je suis différent, Bigfoot.
Je vois le doux solitaire
qu'il y a en toi.
Je parie que t'as un raton blessé
que tu soignes tendrement
tout en disant:
A la fin, ils te tuent,
mais tu nous donnes des lecons.
STATIONNEMENT INTERDIT
C'est juste une soucoupe volante.
Vous ne pouvez pas vous garer ici.
Le parking est là-bas.
Joli tube.
C'est quoi l'idée, là?
Arrêtez de m'enlever.
Pourquoi y a marqué "Sonde 1"?
A l'aide!
Rien ne rafraîchit plus
que le goût pur et coulant
de cette bière canadienne.
On se voit dans 1 h.
J'ai à faire derrière cet arbre.
- Bender, c'était pas la tente de Fry?
- "Bender..."
Bender a raison.
Où est Fry?
Amy, tu ne vas jamais le croire.
C'était si effrayant que...
Je sais. Mais attends la suite.
Fry, par la genèse Sega,
que t'est-il arrivé?
C'est ce que j'essaie de vous dire.
Pourquoi vous me regardez comme ça?
J'ai un truc sur le visage?
Non.
- Il devrait savoir.
- Quoi?
- Rien.
- J'ai l'habitude
d'annoncer les mauvaises nouvelles,
je vais donc le lui dire avec ménagement.
Fry, tu n'as plus de nez.
Ton nez a disparu.
Il n'est plus sur ton visage.
J'ignore où il est,
pas sur ton visage, en tout cas.
Quoi?
C'est mignon.
Tu as coupé ton nez pour ressembler
à ton héros: Moi, Bender.
Ils ont dû le prendre hier soir.
- Hier soir?
- Dans les bois. Je marchais.
Je cherchais Bigfoot.
Puis les E.T. M'ont téléporté.
C'était de petits bonshommes gris
avec une grosse tête ovale?
Je comprends pas. J'ai tort?
Courage, mon ami. En rentrant,
une belle prothèse te redonnera
tout ton éclat.
Je suis un monstre pathétique.
Ma vie est finie.
T'es vraiment un plaisantin, mec.
Je ne connaîtrai plus jamais
le bonheur.
Tu essaies de cacher ta douleur,
je sais, mais t'inquiète pas.
Le professeur peut sûrement te cloner
un nouveau nez.
Ce ne serait pas le même.
Je veux mon nez.
J'apprendrai pas à un autre nez
comment gicler du lait quand je ris.
Inutile de se tracasser.
Dieu que tu es horrible.
C'est un fait, tu n'as plus de nez,
et on ne saura jamais pourquoi.
Les gars. Regardez la télévision.
Les enlèvements E. T:
Inoffensifs jusqu'à maintenant.
Ils ont pris une dimension sinistre
depuis que des victimes insoupçonnées
sont revenues sans nez.
- Comme moi!
- Les coupables:
D'éhontés braconniers,
chasseurs d'humains sans permis.
Le nez précieux ou klaxon humain
est un aphrodisiaque de luxe
chez les extraterrestres.
Mon nez est un aphrodisiaque?
Je vais dégueuler.
La demande est forte, notamment
à cause de scènes émoustillantes
d'émissions d'E. T. Dépravés
trop obscènes pour la TV terrienne.
Regardons.
Du klaxon humain? Mais c'est interdit.
Tout comme notre amour.
Retrouvons mon nez avant qu'un E.T.
Ne s'en empare.
Qui est partant?
Moi, Bender et Zoidberg,
si ca lui dit.
Non, ça va.
BAZAR GALACTIQUE
OFFRANT ARTICLES LÉGAUX, etc.
Voyons, je prendrai un pancréas,
deux sphincters et un grand coca.
Un menu numéro 3.
Inutile. On a fait
tous les bazars dégueulasses
de la galaxie, y compris Pottery Barn.
Attendez. C'est quoi, ça?
LA BÊTE AUX DEUX TRUCS
SEX SHOP
Bienvenue.
Comment puis-je vous pervertir?
Je cherche du klaxon humain.
- Vous n'êtes pas flics, hein?
- Non, bien sûr. C'est un escroc.
Ouais. Qui veut des PEZ volés?
Par ici.
Du klaxon humain. Si frais qu'on peut
encore voir la marque des lunettes.
Non.
Nous voulons ce nez.
Vous l'avez vendu?
Désolé, mais en raison de la nature
pervertie de notre commerce,
les renseignements sur les clients
sont strictement confidentiels.
Par ici.
J'enregistre tout ceux qui entrent ici
pour pouvoir les faire chanter.
Je suis un monstre qui fait dans
le porno. Qu'en ai-je à cirer?
Voici le type bizarre
qui a acheté votre klaxon.
C'est Lrrr, le souverain
de la planète Omicron Persei 8.
Vous avez du klaxon humain?
- Plus fort, vous marmonnez.
- J'ai dit... Du klaxon humain?
- Vous êtes pas flic, hein?
- Non.
Je ne suis que le souverain
de la planète Omicron Persei 8!
Voyons si j'ai bien saisi.
Si j'achète 8 barres de Caramello,
vous irez dans un camp?
C'est le même mensonge qu'on a dit
pour passer vos gardes.
Oh grand roi de l'espace,
rendez-moi mon klaxon humain.
Du klaxon humain? C'est ridicule.
Pourquoi un mâle viril comme Lrrr
en aurait-il besoin?
J'ignore d'ailleurs son utilité.
Qu'est-ce?
- Un ingrédient de la sauce salade?
- T'as jamais vu de salade.
Mon poids est approprié et séduisant.
Vous avez des problèmes.
Elle, elle en a. Pas moi.
Mais il n'y a pas de klaxon humain ici,
alors déguerpissez.
D'accord, j'abandonne.
Je n'ai plus qu'à rentrer
et épouser un putois.
Oh, donnons-le-lui. Tenez!
Mon nez! La lumière de mon visage!
Qu'est-ce?
D'où ça vient, Ndnd?
Je ne l'ai jamais vu auparavant.
Mon ami l'a laissé ici.
Ne bouge pas, Fry. Je peux le recoller
avec mon laser facial d'urgence.
Tu m'as brûlé la joue.
Désolée, j'étais pas concentrée.
Non...
La chair roussie, je peux la sentir.
- Et ces lilas.
- Au moins quelqu'un s'en sera aperçu.
Tu sais que je n'aime pas les lilas.
C'était ta première femme qui les aimait.
Elle aimait aussi la fermer.
- C'était sympa. Nous allons...
- Hé, Altesse.
Juste par curiosité robotique,
pourquoi prendre un nez humain
comme aphrodisiaque au lieu
de son petit oiseau?
Mais je pensais que c'était le klaxon,
le petit oiseau humain.
Non, monsieur. C'est en bas
que ça se passe, près du portefeuille.
Déjà vu des footballeurs
faire un mur?
Ils ne protègent pas leur nez,
ça, c'est sûr. Allez, à plus.
Intéressant. Les pantalons cachent
un petit klaxon secondaire.
- Qu'avez-vous entendu?
- Gardes, saisissez-le.
Préparez-vous à moissonner
le klaxon inférieur.
Ok, vous pouvez prendre mon nez.
- Gardes.
- Oui?
Otez le klaxon inférieur
et préparez-le pour que je le mange.
Donc, mettez beaucoup
de ketchup et de sel dessus.
Amenez-le à notre chambre
et mettez-le dans le tiroir à chaussettes
avec tout ce qui a échoué à réveiller
ma passion pour cette femme.
- Otez pantalon.
- Attendez. Ecoutez...
Je suis souvent le premier
à "klaxonner"...
Ça, c'est sûr!
Mais là, je crois pas que
ca sera bien.
C'est ce qu'elle a dit!
Vous avez des problèmes de couple
qu'un aphrodisiaque
ne peut résoudre.
Peu importe la taille.
Que suggères-tu donc,
pénible petite humaine?
Pourquoi ne pas repenser
à ce qui vous a réunis la première fois?
Oh, je ne sais pas.
Lrrr était si tendre.
J'ai seulement écrit ce poème
pour tester mon imprimante.
On marchait dans les bois
et Lrrr trouvait des lapins blessés
et les soignait.
- Mais c'est moi qui les blessais.
- Chut.
Tu marchais sur eux par accident
puis tu pleurais.
Voilà le sensible que tu étais.
Et tu portais une cape taille 3,
mais plus maintenant!
Apportez-moi ce klaxon inférieur
tant que je suis encore d'humeur!
Si on vous rendait votre passion
sans me mutiler?
Oui. On connaît un super
lieu dans la montagne.
Vous pourriez y dîner à la belle étoile.
Intéressant.
Mais il ne voudrait jamais.
Oh que si.
Tu m'en voudrais si j'y allais pas.
Alors d'accord. Pour une nuit.
Je garde mon klaxon si
vous finissez par la position horizontale.
J'ai pas compris.
Bonjour.
Puis-je vous offrir une boîte de vin?
Non, merci. De l'eau, s'il vous plaît.
Du robinet.
Oh, grande dépense.
Ca suffit. Ce rencard est terminé.
Garcon.
- Que puis-je vous apporter ce soir?
- Votre klaxon inférieur.
Du pain, pour commencer.
Du pain sexy et stimulant.
Bien. Mais pas de cette bouffe
de chèvre.
Et apportez plein de beurre fondu.
Mets-toi donc de la graisse
dans le cul et oublie l'intermédiaire.
Un de ces jours, Ndnd.
Bang. Zoom. Directement sur la 3e lune
d'Omicron Persei 8.
Ce poulet secoué est bon. Je ferai
secouer le klaxon inférieur de Fry.
Il y est habitué!
Alors, comment ça va
les deux amoureux?
- Mal.
- Elle a raison, pour une fois.
Il y a très peu de magie dans l'air.
Préparez le récipient pour le klaxon.
Qui aurait cru qu'une glacière puisse
servir de cercueil?
- Hé, je peux les mettre dedans?
- Ok.
Ne t'inquiète pas, Fry.
J'ai encore une carte à jouer.
La plus belle chanson d'amour
jamais écrite.
Les humains attaquent!
Cueillez le klaxon inférieur
et filons d'ici!
Vite, Fry, sauve-toi.
Allez, cage de la liberté.
Mets-moi en sécurité!
Je ne pensais pas m'échapper avec
mon petit oiseau, mais je l'en ai sorti.
Exactement comme au cinéma!
Donne-moi ca.
Bigfoot! Il existe. Je le savais.
Le livre sur le monstre du Loch Ness
était vrai.
Salut, mon ami à fourrure.
Regarde ses adorables petits pieds.
Oui, tu es vraiment mignon.
Nom d'un chien!
Incroyable, je vois Bigfoot.
Et l'image est nette.
J'ai attendu toute ma vie
pour cet instant.
- Quoi?
- Que faites-vous?
Vous allez tuer ce géant innocent?
Non, bien sûr.
Je vais juste l'endormir
pour couper ses pieds
comme preuves de son existence
puis le larguer dans la nature.
Il s'en sortira.
Il faudra d'abord me passer dessus.
D'accord. Cinq sur cinq.
Maintenant, laissez en paix
ce gentil yéti ou singe des forêts
afin que je puisse enfin récolter le klaxon
inférieur de cet humain pathétique.
Ouais!
Stop. Qu'est-ce que je raconte?
Si je braconne son klaxon inférieur,
suis-je meilleur
que ce ranger et sa folle soif
de pieds?
Oui, mais pas assez.
But!
Le klaxon inférieur de cet humain
est l'une des créatures de Dieu.
Une chose vivante.
Et toutes, petites et grandes...
Petite, en ce qui le concerne!
Ont de la dignité
et un étincelle divine.
Voilà le guerrier poète doux et sensible
dont je suis tombée amoureuse.
Oh, oui...
Vous serez en sécurité
dans un rayon de 500 m.
On dirait que tu vas pouvoir te tenir
à ton klaxon inférieur.
Comme d'habitude!
Fuyez!
- Là, là, là.
- Oh, oui.
Vous êtes sur une aire de loisirs,
l'esprit humain. Vous demandez
votre chemin à un passant
mais il n 'a pas de visage.
Soudain devant,
une porte sur la route.
Vous déviez, évitant de justesse
la Porte de l'Effroi.
J'ai combiné l'ADN
des pires monstres du monde
pour créer la plus diabolique
des créatures.
Il s'avère que c'est l'homme.

JEUX OLYMPIQUES 3004
CÉRÉMONIE D'OUVERTURE
Bienvenue aux
Olympiades terriennes de 3004!
Vivez-en toutes les émotions
grâce à notre extraordinaire couverture.
Vous retrouverez Combats de singes
la semaine prochaine.
Qui soutenir? L'Amérique?
Ou un pays dont
je viens d'apprendre l'existence?
Pourquoi pas ces types?
Non. C'est la République
des Stéréotypes Français.
Tout le monde les déteste.
Allons voir Hermes.
Tout ce multiculturalisme inspiré
me fait tourner le sang!
La Suède? Je n'y crois pas.
Vas-y, barre, essaie de me toucher!
Mon mari, ça fait 20 ans que
tu ne pratiques plus le limbo olympique.
Cesse de te mentir, mon gros.
L'équipe jamaïcaine de limbo
semble pouvoir se passer de toi.
C'est tout ce que
les Jamaïcains font, non?
Nous avons
d'autres passions!
C'est pour ça que l'équipe
est retenue à l'aéroport.
Ils ont donc demandé à mon mari
de se ridiculiser pour les remplacer.
J'ai promis de faire de mon mieux.
Ont-ils vu ton physique
après toutes ces années?
J'ai utilisé les plus beaux euphémismes
pour me décrire au téléphone.
Pas d'inquiétude.
Ce gros porc sera parfait
avec ce costume anti-flasque extensible
que j'ai spécialement conçu.
Il redistribue le poids et rapproche
le centre de gravité des genoux.
C'est douillet.
- J'attends ça depuis des années.
- Voilà un corps de limbo-man!
Quel beau rôti jamaïcain!
Tais-toi, Zoidberg.
L'épreuve de pliage commence.
Je pourrais facilement battre
ces professionnels.
NON PLIABLE
C'est sûrement
le plus grand plieur du monde!
Mes rêves de gloire s'évanouissent déjà.
Et c'est là toute ma vie.
Athlètes, veuillez prendre place
pour le 500 mètres de limbo masculin.
Hermes Conrad, c'est toi
dans ce petit corps boulot?
Barbade Svelte!
Que fais-tu ici?
- Je te croyais à la Barbade.
- Et j'y retournerai
avec une médaille d'or pesant
sur mes élégantes épaules antillaises.
Ton corps est aussi parfait
qu'il y a 20 ans
quand tu me bottais le train
sans cesse.
Mais aujourd'hui,
je me sens en veine.
Je vois que tu places toujours la barre
aussi bas en matière d'élégance.
Barbade Svelte, c'est la taffe
qui fait déborder le filtre!
Limbo-eurs, à vos marques.
Détendus... Limbo!
Ils partent!
Barbade Svelte prend la tête.
Dieu, faites qu'il gagne.
Que vois-je?
Hermes Conrad le rattrape.
Une leçon de volonté
qui me va droit au cœur.
Va au diable, Barbade Svelte!
Allez, costume chéri!
C'EST TOI LE MAN
Allez, Hermes!
Ecrase ce dieu d'acajou!
Barbade, puis Conrad.
Conrad prend le dessus.
Et Conrad se disqualifie!
Barbade Svelte, mon héros,
est médaillé d'or.
Mon Hermes!
Tu as fait de ton mieux.
Si j'avais voulu un adonis
pour époux,
je serais restée mariée
à Barbade Svelte.
Moi non plus,
je n'aurais pas pu remporter l'or.
Même au pliage,
ce pour quoi je suis fait.
C'est si gênant.
J'aimerais que tout le monde meure.
Et maintenant,
l'épreuve de robot féminin de pliage.
Féminin?
Un robot mâle, intelligemment déguisé,
doit pouvoir gagner.
Mais il me faudra faire preuve
de subtilité, de nuance, de grâce.
Comment ça, pas inscrite?
Je m'appelle Fernande,
je viens de Robonia.
- Fernande est un nom de fille.
- Oui.
Mais Robonia, ça sonne improvisé.
T'as déjà été cogné
par un type déguisé en nana?
Oui.
FERNANDE
GRAND-DUCHÉ DE ROBONIA
Elle est droite. Fernande gagne!
Encore une médaille d'or
pour l'audacieuse Robonienne!
Un pliage parfait,
une réception sans vagues!
Résultats parfaits!
Cinq médailles d'or pour Fernande.
Je suis génial. Ils sont tous nuls.
A part ce type, Bender.
Lui, c'est quelque chose.
Vérification de sexe
pour tous les médaillés.
Tu pensais qu'on te laisserait partir
sans vérifier tes fluides?
Mon Dieu, et mes médailles!
C'est tout ce qui me reste
des Olympiades.
Attendez. J'ai une idée.
- Professeur, faites de moi une femme!
- Tenons-nous-en à l'amitié.
Je ne veux pas d'amis,
mais changer de sexe. Et maintenant!
Bender, changer de sexe est
une opération complexe et dangereuse.
Remplacer ta testostér-huile
par des fluides de robot-femme
peut jouer sur tes humeurs.
Et ce peut être irréversible.
- Allons-y.
- Non! Vous ne pouvez pas!
C'est un manque de respect
envers la dignité des femmes.
Je suis désolé, je dois le faire.
Pas pour vous, pas pour Bender,
mais pour la fierté
du peuple de Robonia.
MÉDECINE ROBOTIQUE
Allez. Allez!
Je ne regarderai pas,
c'est sale et c'est mal.
- Quoique, par curiosité.
- Silence!
Je vais bientôt
donner au corps de Bender
une apparence tendre et délicate.
Je draine l'huile mâle.
J'injecte l'huile femelle.
J'enlève une chose.
On ne peut plus attendre
Fernande!
C'est bientôt l'heure
des Zombies Osbourne.
Je suis prête pour le test,
les garçons.
Vive Robonia
Un pays que je n 'ai pas inventé
Vas-y, chérie, vise un peu la bombe.
Allez, bébé, vas-y!
Bouge tes lolos! Remue-toi!
J'hésite entre rage et dégoût.
Je sers notre image,
à nous les femmes.
Tu nous fais passer
pour des imbéciles, oui!
- Mais tu n'es pas vraiment une femme.
- Bien sûr que non.
Mon Dieu, un dessous de verre!
Les fémifluides semblent
se lover dans ton processeur.
Faites-moi l'opération inverse.
Mes seins m'empêchent de dormir.
Allo? Pardon?
Passer dans
Sacrée soirée avec Humourbot 5.0?
J'en serais ravie! Ma limousine?
Je ne l'ai pas. Envoyez-m'en une.
Ce sera pour plus tard, professeur.
Je passe à la télé.
Fry, aide-moi à trouver une tenue.
SACRÉE SOIRÉE
avec Humourbot 5.0
Calculon, voulez-vous présenter
cet extrait de Tous mes circuits?
Non, je crois qu'il parle de lui-même.
Pour l'anecdote, dans le script,
je devais dire "oui".
- Mais je l'ai joué à ma manière.
- Anecdote approuvée.
Pas de réplique disponible.
Tapez dans vos mains pour accueillir
mon invitée cinq fois médaillée,
Fernande de Robonia.
Fernande, de nombreuses robot-femmes
vous adulent.
- Un conseil pour elles?
- Oui, Humourbot.
Je crois
que les femmes sont trop coincées
pour sortir et se dandiner
comme tout le monde le veut.
Voulez-vous que je vous montre?
Très bien.
Regarde bien, chéri. On y va.
Remue-moi ca.
Tu dois en jouer, ma fille, le remuer.
C'est bon. Allez. Bouge-moi tout ça.
La célébrité que je suis
est impressionnée.
Je parie que tu dis ça à toutes
les robot-femmes cinq fois médaillées.
A partir d'aujourd'hui, je le ferai
autant que possible.
Ca alors! Pardon?
- Ça peut vous sembler présomptueux...
- J'adore ca.
...mais je serais heureux
de dîner avec vous.
Calculon, vous exaucez le rêve
d'une jeune fille naïve de Robonia.
Evidemment.
Ce haut me grossit. C'est trop osé
d'aller nue à un premier dîner?
- Oui!
- Parfait.
Sois honnête. Tu n'es pas
vraiment attiré par Calculon?
- Si c'est oui, ne dis rien.
- Bien sûr que non.
C'est juste l'occasion de dîner
avec une star non bâillonnée.
Est-ce trop demander?
C'est une honte, ce dîner.
Je ne m'y impliquerai pas.
Et tu as trop de rouge à lèvres.
Tu plaisantes?
Il m'en faut plus. Bien plus!
Et voilà. Les hommes adorent
quand y en a une tonne.
- C'est faux!
- Non!
De grâce!
Tous les hommes aiment les traînées.
Pas étonnant
que vous soyez célibataires.
Les hommes sont les mieux placés
pour jouer les femmes.
Mais s'il veut...
S'il essaie de...
Barry White?
Je dirai que je veux qu'il s'engage.
Ca lui bouchera les conduits.
Quel genre de femme volatile es-tu?
Pourquoi ne comprenez-vous rien?
Une fille ne peut-elle pas s'amuser
sans être jugée?
Ses changements d'humeur
s'aggravent.
Elle est esclave de ses émotions.
Comme toutes les femmes.
Toi en particulier, Leela.
Moi aussi, je m'inquiète pour lui.
PLAT DU SOIR:
CUISSOT DE SAUMON
Avec une telle descente, vous m'évitez
un tour aux poubelles. Bam!
J'apprécierais que vous ne "bamiez" pas
ma compagne.
Et moi, j'apprécierais de le faire.
Nous sommes quittes.
Fernande, jamais une femme
ne m'a fasciné autant que moi-même.
Vous êtes si douce.
Et vous savez garder l'esprit libre.
J'ai l'impression que vous comprenez
mieux les hommes que moi-même.
- Je ne connais personne comme vous.
- Mais si.
J'aimerais passer
un moment précieux avec vous.
Quoi? Pas question, rien du tout!
Pour qui me prenez-vous?
Vous ai-je dit que je possède
le plus beau yacht du monde?
LA FIERTÉ DE CALCULON
LE TALENT DE CALCULON
COUPLES DE SPORTIFS
ET D'ACTEURS EN IMAGES
Je suis un trophée!
Sans blague! Il pleut des cadeaux.
Je crois que Calculon est amoureux.
Il me jettera bientôt
pour un autre sucre d'orge.
Je redeviendrai un homme, point final.
Ce n'est qu'un jeu.
Fernande, je ne pense plus qu'à toi,
je ne dors plus.
Comme tous les robots,
je ne dors jamais.
Mais peu importe,
je ne dors pas car je t'aime.
Oh, ma chérie.
Veux-tu m'épouser?
Oh, Calculon. Oui, je le veux!
Elle a peut-être raison
pour le rouge à lèvres.
Tu me manqueras. Tu étais
comme un frère, puis une sœur.
Et maintenant tu te maries.
Je t'aime, vieux.
- C'est une blague, ce mariage.
- Cool. A table?
- Comment ça, une blague?
- Je l'épouse, je divorce,
je prends la moitié de son fric
et je redeviens un homme.
Comme une arnaque pyramidale
pour 2.
- C'est beau, le mariage.
- Tu le manipules, c'est mal!
T'es jamais sortie avec un type
parce que tu avais faim?
Je pensais l'aimer,
l'estomac plein.
Bien essayé, sœurette.
Veuillez m'excuser, je dois rencontrer
mon organisateur de mariage.
Zoidberg?
Zoidy chéri? Les fanfreluches
sont à la mode cette année?
Il y a un gâteau là-dedans
dont tu te souviendras toute ta vie.
En tout cas, moi, oui.
Le soir, il me hante
avec son glaçage de rêve.
Commande ce gâteau!
J'ai quelque chose pour toi.
Une télécommande?
Tu m'as acheté une télé?
Non, ma chérie.
Elle commande mon cœur.
Elle symbolise ton pouvoir
sur mes émotions.
- Ca marche avec ma télé?
- Pas besoin de télé.
Nous sommes ensemble.
Fernande, si je ne pouvais
passer ma vie avec toi,
je sauterais de ce ballon.
- Allons! Vraiment?
- Oui.
Nous sommes faits
pour nous aimer.
Alors, tu m'aimes réellement?
Tellement que je me prépare à quitter
la télévision pour être avec toi.
Tu as toujours dit
que tu brûlerais un couvent
- plutôt qu'abandonner la télé.
- J'ai dit tant de choses.
Tout ce que je veux maintenant,
c'est une villa avec vue sur les vignes,
et toi.
- Avec des ânes?
- Tout ce que tu pourras manger.
Prends-moi dans tes bras
et comprime-moi. Comprime-moi fort!
Attends!
Montons au plus haut des cieux,
que les dieux eux-mêmes
nous envient!
Je n'arrive plus
à assumer cette farce.
- Quoi?
- Tu veux l'épouser?
Non, mais je ne veux pas le blesser
ni l'humilier.
Maudit soit ce cœur de femme!
Tu atteins le stade
le plus débilitant de la féminité.
Tu es restée une femme trop longtemps,
imbécile!
Ecoute. Si je t'aide,
promets-tu de redevenir un homme
et de le rester?
On ne peut empêcher ce mariage
sans blesser Calculon.
Mais il est acteur.
Il est donc capable d'endurer
la douleur de série B.
MARIAGE DE STARS
GENS ORDINAIRES EX CLUS
- Tout le monde est prêt?
- Ouais.
Absolument.
Chers acteurs,
chers agents de casting,
vous qui pourriez me trouver
un rôle de prêtre,
bienvenue!
La mariée a écrit des vœux
que nous allons tous
faire semblant d'écouter.
Cher Calculon,
l'éternité ne serait pas assez longue
pour que je te dise combien je t'aime.
Y a-t-il un docteur...
J'ai fait au plus vite.
Cela m'a tout l'air d'être
une fièvre hydraulique d'Afrique.
Mon Dieu! La maladie
de mon personnage dans la saison 2
quand je demandais plus d'argent.
Elle est fatale.
Quoi qu'il arrive, souviens-toi:
La flamme de mon amour éternel
brûlera à tout jamais.
Bien sûr. Mais mon sucre, je croyais
que cette maladie n'existait
que dans les mines
de diamants du Congo.
Fernande! Tu es le Mal!
Tu croyais pouvoir nous voler
ces diamants, à Congo Jack et moi?
Ils appartiennent aux indigènes!
Le sort est si cruel et mélodramatique!
Pourquoi?
Calculon, chéri, ce puissant "pourquoi"
m'a partiellement ramenée à la vie.
- Congo Jack!
- Encore un coup de théâtre!
J'ai un message
de la part du colonel Matombay.
Il dit: "C'est de la part
de Congo Jack."
N-O-O-O!
Je ne te quitterai pas
tant que je ne serai pas sûre
que tu as compris ce que j'ai dit
à propos de mon amour éternel
pour toi.
- Et cetera.
- J'ai compris.
- J'ai compris.
- Très bien.
Je suis médecin. Elle est morte.
La vie l'a quittée.
Mais consolons-nous en pensant
qu'elle m'aimait vraiment.
Pour honorer mon deuil, je serai la star
d'un film tourné à sa mémoire.
Et cette fois,
ils ne me refuseront pas l'Oscar.
Pas quand ils verront
Fernande: L 'histoire de Calculon.
Fernande, ta mort me remplit
de douleur, de colère, de crainte.
Toutes les émotions
qu'un acteur peut jouer.
Eteignez cette cochonnerie.
Une seule erreur
et Bender restera à jamais
à osciller entre les deux sexes.
Ça t'apprendra à ne pas vouloir
changer de sexe pour une médaille.
C'est certain.
Cette romance m'a beaucoup appris
sur moi-même.
- Presque terminé.
- J'aimerais tant...
que lui et moi allions à Végas
pour trouver des cailles
et les plumer toute la nuit!
Je retrouve mon pote
et ses sentiments envers les femmes.
J'espérais que cette expérience
t'ait ouvert à la sensibilité.
Ouais, mais on se refait pas.
Fernande, les cieux eux-mêmes
pleurent
la plus belle fleur
que les champs aient portée.
- Cochonnerie larmoyante!
- Allez, Bender, on y va.
Ce navet gnangnan
me donne la nausée.
Les émotions sont minables
et devraient être bannies.
Bonne nuit éternelle, ma tourterelle.
- Bonne nuit, Calculon.
- Que dis-tu?
Je dis que vous n'êtes pas
assez sexy, vous deux.
Fidèle à moi-même.

- 10 dollars, s'il vous plaît.
- La vache.
Dors, mon petit beignet.
Je remplace ta maman.
- Des pouêt-pouêt pour robots.
- Et un arbre à robots.
- Tu devrais essayer, Bender.
- J'ai encore ma fierté.
Mesdames, messieurs, Killbot a
des Notes Lotus et une mitrailleuse.
- C'est le meilleur.
- Dans tes rêves, wallaby à lunettes.
Ne m'appelle pas comme ça, attention.
Wernstrom.
Que de violence gratuite.
Allons faire un tour
en pédalo.
PRÉSENTATION DES NOUVEAUTÉS
mamancomp
Le secret pour y arriver,
c'était de gratter un bon coup.
Voici celle qui a le maman-pole
de l'industrie des robots.
- J'ai compris.
- Maman!
Maintenant, j'ai compris.
Bonjour, mes chéris.
J'adore cette vieille taupe.
Mesdames et messieurs,
pour la 17e année consécutive,
l'avenir des robots s'offre à nous.
Mes garçons,
je vous présente le Robot 1 -X.
Magnifique.
Pour être honnête, le Robot 1 -X
va ridiculiser tous mes autres robots.
L'un de mes anciens modèles
veut-il monter sur scène?
Ici. J'arrive. Je suis à toi.
- Allez, Maman.
- Pauvre nase!
Voilà.
Je suis ton super crack.
Ce robot obsolète marche à l'alcool
et émet des substances polluantes.
Le Robot 1 -X marche à la pollution
et émet de l'oxygène pur
avec une fine senteur de pin.
Ca sent drôlement bon.
Observons ces robots
devant une même tâche ménagère,
comme trier un pot de petite monnaie.
Tâche accomplie. Valeur totale:
4,73 $ plus 1 Lek albanais.
Très bien, Robot 1 -X.
Et vous, unité bourrée?
On ne m'a rien donné à trier.
Nuls.
Voici les Robots Gentils de Maman.
AVANT APRES
Génial, ce robot.
A côté, j'étais un vieux tas rouillé.
C'est vrai.
C'est pour ça que j'en ai acheté un.
Essayons-le. Robot 1 -X, peux-tu
nettoyer la litière de Nibbler?
Oui, tout de suite.
Moi aussi, si on me le demande.
Je te l'ai demandé il y a 5 minutes.
Ça, un baiser? Regarde plutôt.
Viens là, Nibbler.
Si tu veux faire quelque chose,
arrête de flirter et aide-nous.
Monte installer cette fausse parabole.
- C'est pour épater les voisins.
- A vos ordres.
- Demande à Robot 1 -X de t'aider.
- Non!
Dégage, bizut! Je me débrouille.
- Nos propriétaires m'ont envoyé.
- Regarde ce que j'envoie, moi.
A l'aide!
Je ne voulais pas dire toi.
Désolé. J'ai fini ton travail
avant de te sauver la vie.
Je vous évite le tracas
d'avoir à me jeter.
Sors de là et viens regarder la télé.
Impossible. Je suis coincé.
Demande à Robot 1 -X de te tirer.
Jamais!
- Pourquoi?
- Je le déteste.
C'est un outil qui facilite la vie.
Comme une clé à pipe.
- Je ne peux pas lui demander, car...
- Oui?
Il me fait peur.
- Désolée.
- Il n'y a qu'une solution.
Tu as besoin d'une mise à jour
de compatibilité avec Robot 1 -X.
Je croyais que tout le monde
me trouvait parfait.
- N'est-ce pas, Fry?
- Tu es pratiquement parfait.
"Pratiquement parfait"? Tu penses
qu'il me faut une mise à jour.
Mais oui, bon sang!
Bien. Je reviens dans quelques jours.

C'est rien.
Je déteste tellement ces 1 -X
que ça ne me fera rien.
A mort, les Robots 1 -X!
J'adore ces magnifiques Robots 1 -X.
Les Robots 1 -X sont mes amis.
Et ton envie féroce
de les poignarder?
C'est fini. A plus, mec.
Il n'est plus lui-même.
Vous avez brisé sa robo-humanité.
J'ai changé d'avis.
J'ai réussi. Je me suis échappé.
Mais vers quelle vie?
J'ai peur de la mise à jour,
mais sans, je ne peux pas
revoir mes amis.

C'est moi qui devrais être fâché.
Tourne-toi.
C'est marrant, j'ai chaud.
Des bières!
Qui est-ce?
Qui êtes vous
et en quoi ça me concerne?
Face A: Nous sommes
une communauté de robots dépassés
refusant les mises à jour.
Nous sommes venus ici...
Face B: Pour mener une vie simple,
sans technologie.
Une unité à chargeur qui fonctionne?
C'est dépassé depuis longtemps.
RÉPONSE CINGLANTE
Ta mère!
Ce qu'Unité à Chargeur veut dire,
c'est parce qu'on est dépassés
qu'on est uniques.
Moi, je dois recharger ma roue à eau
sinon je m'éteins à jamais.
C'est trop tard cette fois!
C'est la fin!
- On se plaît ici.
- Comme si vous aviez le choix.
- Quel est ton problème?
- Pas assez...
- De mémoire?
- Génial.
Ce mot a remplacé ma femme
dans ma mémoire.
Mon Dieu! Non!
Je veux vivre!
Tu es le bienvenu
dans notre communauté.
Sans vous vexer, j'ai besoin
de technologie, e-mails et autoneiges.
Et la télévision. Sans elle,
comment être branché?
Pourquoi la télé alors qu'on peut
observer un escargot durant des heures?
C'est complètement ridicule.
Il ne passera jamais ce caillou.
Attendez. Il a réussi!
- Oui!
- Génial.
C'est extraordinaire. Fêtons ca.
- Allez!
- D'où sort ce CD?
Un de mes CD pour une île déserte.
Je ne pensais jamais m'en servir.
Allez! Je danse.
Les CD ne sont pas naturels.
Ecoute l'océan.
Quel océan? Celui-là?
Comme si la Terre
se faisait l'amour sucré-salé,
avec tous les poissons qui dansent.
Je me débarrasse de ca.
Prends ça, Beethoven, bâtard sourd!
Bang, bang, bang.
Tu as tout compris à la vie,
petit singe aux cymbales.
On sait que la technologie te manque.
Alors on t'a trouvé cette machine
qui s'est échouée.
Je vais si bien laver mon linge...
Je ne comprends pas.
Cette technologie
ne m'apporte que malheur.
DIRE L'ÉVIDENCE
Mais Bender, tu es technologie,
tu es la chose la plus évoluée ici.
C'est vrai. Je représente l'horrible
triomphe de la forme et de la fonction.
Mais plus pour longtemps.
Aïe! Ca fait mal.
La rétroaction est accomplie.
Admirez ma pureté artisanale.
Le monde moderne peut aller
se faire mettre... une écharde!
Bienvenue dans une vie
de simple tranquillité.
Laisse tomber! Le monde
doit apprendre nos mœurs pacifiques.
Par la force.
Quoi?
- Quoi?
- Retour à la civilisation
pour combattre la technologie.
Quoi?
Souquez ferme.
Cette attaque de la technologie
sera digne
de figurer dans une chanson.
Trois semaines de mer...
Je devrais vérifier notre position.
Des miroirs réfléchissants?
De la sorcellerie high-tech, oui.

D'accord. Tirez!

Nous vivons dans le futur.
Je vais allumer des bougies.
Je viens vous libérer
de vos vies compliquées.
Enfin, vous libérer du "compliqué",
pas de vos vies.
Il est en bois.
- Alors, Bender?
- J'ai subi une rétroaction:
Robot à vapeur,
tel que la nature m'a fait.
- Je dois donc tuer le Robot 1 -X.
- C'est stupide.
M. Bender veut que je me détruise?
Pas besoin de ta pitié.
Visez le Robot 1 -X et tirez!
Tu as détruit mon vaisseau,
idiot à la noix!
Essaie encore, Sinclair.
Vise le Robot 1 -X.
- C'est qui?
- Feu.
Tout est bien qui finit bien.
Génial. Nous sommes écrasés.

A l'aide, Bender en bois!
Ils détestent le feu.
Je dois les aider.
Que se...

Je peux sauver mes amis sans jambe.
J'ai mes vieux bras extensibles.
Dépêche-toi. L'essence coûte cher.
- Et aussi... Nous allons mourir.
- J'arrive.
Corps primitif minable!
J'aurais dû faire la mise à jour.
Je suis un vieux débris.
- Puis-je suggérer...
- La ferme!
Attends. Je peux me servir de toi.
Je resterai quand même le héros adulé.
- Que puis-je faire?
- Sauve mes amis et Zoidberg.
Regardez, mes cheveux roussis
sont encore plus jolis.
- Où est Bender?
- Ici.
Je ne voulais pas vous faire de mal,
juste détruire ce en quoi vous croyez.
Tu nous as au moins sauvés...
De toi.
Tu as enfin résolu
ton incompatibilité.
Nous étions en phase.
Je lui ai demandé de vous sauver
et il l'a fait.
Sa technologie est formidable.
J'adore ces super robots 1 -X.
Les robots 1 -X sont mes amis.
Il a changé de personnalité.
Ce n'est pas une si bonne idée.
Je voudrais peloter le Robot 1 -X...
- Que se passe-t-il?
- Une mise à jour.
J'ai détruit la technologie,
j'ai couru sur la plage
et senti le sable sur mes écrous.
Chacun vit la mise à jour différemment.
Si ce n'était pas réel,
comment distinguer la réalité?
N'est-il pas possible, probable,
que ma vie ne soit
que le produit d'une imagination?
Non. Dégage. Au suivant.
Disons que la réalité
est ce qu'on en fait.
Oui. Merci, mon chou.

Censurez Bender
Précédemment
dans All My Circuits...
Je suis désolé, père.
J'ai oublié comment être votre fils.
- Pourquoi, Antonio?
- Parce que... Je suis amnésique!
- Calculon! Je te croyais...
- Egyptien?
Avant de te tuer, une question:
Qui suis-je?
Car je suis... Amnésique!
Soyons clairs.
Quelqu'un ici n'est pas amnésique?
- Je ne suis pas sûre.
- Je sais pas.
Cette série est géniale!
Plus tard, je serai amnésique.
Moi aussi! Je le suis. J'ai oublié.
- Je le suis plus que toi!
- Bande de nazes!
- Désolé.
- C'est bon, je l'ai mérité.
BON ANNIVERSAIRE
CALCULON!
Bienvenue, la jet-set!
C'est la folie douce!
Des groupes de rock nus,
de gros tas de talc.
Quel anniversaire.
Je vais fêter mon anniversaire
comme Calculon!
Eh bien, je viendrai
aussi classe que Monique.
Vous êtes obligés de toujours
imiter la télé?
Oui, puisqu'on n'a que 12 ans.
T'es un clone du professeur.
Les clones fêtent leur anniversaire?
Quoi?
Papa, j'ai un anniversaire?
Tu n'es pas vraiment né,
donc techniquement, non.
Ne sois pas triste.
On peut fêter ta sortie
de la cuve de clonage.
Ou quand j'ai eu ton ADN
en grattant ma tumeur du dos.
- Celui-là!
- Oui.
Ça fera 13 ans la semaine prochaine.
J'ai utilisé cette fourchette.
Mais c'est pas...
Ce sera aussi
mon anniversaire!
Comment faire une fête
pour vous deux ici
et faire passer les frais sur le bureau.
Je sais!
Comme je viens de dire!
Bravo, vieux!
Il se passe un truc à la télé!
Tant d'années avant de prendre
un bain de champagne!
J'ai découvert le secret
que Mère a gardé depuis 200 ans!
Accroche-toi bien,
tu pourrais avoir
une attaque d'amnésie!
L 'horrible secret c'est...
Le réalisateur est le roi du suspense!
Il est foutu. Sortons-le d'ici.
Acteur Cassé
Voici votre programme préféré:
Tout le monde aime Hypno-Crapo!
C'est de plus en plus mauvais.
BONNE JOURNÉE
DU GRATTAGE!
Regardez qui est là.
Zoidberg, le clochard!
Un spectacle pour enfants?
Un spectacle? J'aurais besoin d'argent
pour acheter des chaussures.
Fête pourrie!
Il y a 3 heures que les invités
devraient être arrivés.
Ça veut pas dire qu'ils ne viendront pas
ou que vous êtes nuls.
Pourquoi penser ça?
Ils ont dû venir en groupe!
Bienvenue la jet-set!
C'est la folie douce!
On m'a donné cette invitation
comme aumône.
Bonne journée du grattage!
...vire-les tous.
Il se passe encore
quelque chose à la télé!
Diversion et Invasion
Bienvenue à Diversion et Invasion.
De l'autre côté de la galaxie,
mon peuple a une flotte
qui exterminera les humains!
D 'abord, ces nouvelles d'Hollywood.
Suite à la panne de Calculon junior,
la série All My Circuits
fait un casting
d'enfants robots pour le remplacer.
Un casting d'enfants robots?
Tu penses comme moi?
- Quoi?
- Que je suis fait pour le rôle!
Mes espoirs sont nés
et morts en peu de temps!
Ton charme latin ne suffira pas.
Y a plein d'enfants célèbres.
C'est Macaulay Culkon!
Il n'est plus mignon depuis la puberté.
Ce robot a dévalisé
un magasin de bonbons.
Et ce robot est devenu
un magasin de bonbons.
Ticket de loterie, s'il te plaît.
On est prêts pour la 1re audition.
"Emote-atron Jr."?
On va te faire beau pour la dame.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai dit?
Plus de câbles qui pendent!
Tu viens d'apprendre
que ton vrai père
est un des septuplés démoniaques
de Calculon, Sleazy Martinez.
On y va!
Maintenant que je sais la vérité,
je dois aller rejoindre
les robo-banditos à Veracruz!
Ce gamin est nul! On veut Bender!
Je le trouvais bon
mais le public a parlé.
- Mais...
- Suivant!
...à Veracruz.
Passe-moi mon poncho et...
On veut Bender!
Bender est le meilleur!
Désolé, ça marche pas.
90 acteurs, et tous ont été hués.
J'aimerais voir ce fameux Bender.
Il a l'air bon.
Il y a un Bender
mais il est trop vieux...
Sur-le-champ!
Bender est meilleur!
M. Bender?
- Etes-vous déjà passé à la télé?
- Pour enlèvement.
J'ai vu. J'ai aimé. On vous écoute.
"Banditos"? Super!
Je sais prendre
un accent espagnol parfait.
On verra. Adios, Padre.
Viens, Jesus, fidèle chihuahua.
Ce soir on mange du guacamole
au bord du El Rio!
C'était tellement nul
que vous m'avez filé un cancer!
Malgré votre popularité,
je ne veux pas de vous!
- Ouais, Bender!
- On veut Bender!
Cependant, je vous engage.
Bienvenue fiston!
Père!
ENREGISTREMENT
BIENVENUE (SAUF AUTEURS)
Le réalisateur.
Je ne connais pas son nom.
J'ai lu le script.
Le personnage serait mieux
- s'il était en feu.
- T'inquiète.
On l'a adapté pour toi.
Alors j'ai un accent anglais?
Tu es dans le coma.
Couche-toi et ne bouge pas.
Action!
C'est nul. Je pouvais être anglais.
Hélas, mon seul fils sombre
dans un irréversible et permanent
coma.
Permanent? Ça ne va pas du tout
pour Antonio. Je me lève.
Maudit soit cet accident...
Salut, c'est Antonio!
Appelez-moi Bender!
J'ai des fourmis aux fesses,
je veux qu'on me voit!
Allez!
Je ne suis pas habitué à voir ça.
Mords mon cul en métal brillant!
Allez, baby, vas-y baby!
Coupez! Quel mauvais jeu de coma!
On recommence.
Non, je ne fais pas deux prises.
- Mais...
- Les amateurs font 2 prises.
Je ne fais qu'une prise. T'imprimes?
Mords mon cul en métal brillant!
Allez baby, vas-y baby!
Ça c'est une bonne danse, non, Calcy?
Les figurants de Godzilla étaient meilleurs.
Je ne me souviens pas de cette scène.
C'est la caméra de sécurité du vestiaire.
Il vole la vedette et mon argent!
Virez-moi ce criminel!
- Les exécu-bots arrivent!
- Mon Dieu!
Présentation du président de la chaîne!
Vous connaissez déjà mes exécu-bots:
Alpha est programmé
pour aimer ce qu'il a déjà vu.
- Salut...
- Beta.
Programmé pour jeter les dés
pour déterminer la prochaine saison.
Encore plus de télé-réalité!
Et Gamma, programmé
pour sous-estimer l'Américain moyen.
Arriverons-nous à leur faire
quitter leurs tracteurs?
Qui a mis cet odieux robot
sur ma chaîne?
- On le vire...
- Silence!
On a observé l'audimat.
Pendant ces 12 secondes,
l'attention oculaire
était de plus de 90 pour cent!
Mais des enfants regardent.
Bender est un sale modèle.
On aime la saleté.
Etre salement riches,
c'est ce qu'on aime!
"Mords mon cul en métal"
peut être une accroche!
- 80 pour cent de chances.
- Passera à Peoria.
Jeux-télé de retour!
Il nous faut ce robot excité!
Vous pouvez continuer à boire
et fumer à la télé?
Sans problème.

- Ces voyous ont fumé un de tes cigares.
- C'est pas un cigare!
- C'est pas à moi.
- Mords mon cul en métal brillant!
Ce serait des plus désagréables
pour nous deux!
- Qui t'a appris un tel langage?
- Bender, mon brave.
Ce type commence à me friser

- Là, vous allez voir!
- Tais-toi, y a Bender.

C'est si bon de fuir la ville

N'ESSAYEZ PAS CA CHEZ VOUS
Ce phénomène de télé
est-il un mauvais exemple?
N'importe quoi.
Les "Parents En Télépétard"
répondent "Sans dec, oui!"
Quels tordus
se regrouperaient contre Bender?
Bonne nouvelle!
On fait un groupe anti-Bender!
Ça, c'était bizarre.
Les Parents En Télépétard
dénoncent

Tout ça pour des rires bon marché?
Le P.E.T. Ne va pas se laisser faire.
Pas avec le P.E. T, messieurs!
On peut pas me censurer que pour ça.
C'est grossier,
mais je suis d'accord avec Bender.
Ça n'influence pas les gosses.
Pour ça, faites confiance à l'école.
Les pères sont gonflés de bêtostérone.
- On veut juste être cool comme lui.
- Ça marche même pas.
Fumer et boire nous fait gerber.
Je sais comment l'imiter sans gerber.
On peut voler des trucs.
Bender adore voler des trucs!
Qui? On connaît personne
ayant des trucs cool.
Si! On connaît quelqu'un
de très cool: Bender!
On va voler Bender!

Voilà ma carte.
On a juste invité quelques amis.
Votre histoire cloche
mais je ne sais pas pourquoi.
Si! Vous n'avez pas d'amis!
Pourquoi ils vous trouvent cools

- On est cools.
- Balivernes!
Je vais juger de ça

Bon sang!
Je lis plus de 40 mega-Fonzies.
Tous dehors!
Vous connaissez une autre fête?
Parce que j'ai l'esprit
à la fête, maintenant.
Il y en a des trucs cools ici.
D'où ca vient?
Ne parlez pas!
Un pour tous, tous pour un!
- On a tout volé.
- Zut.
- Que se passe-t-il?
- Je vais te dire.
Nos garçons se sont mis à voler.
Un des pires crimes!
A cause de toi, con de cool!
Lâchez-moi!
La télé serait nulle,
s'il n'y avait que de bons exemples.
Bender, c'est du divertissement!
Je ne suis pas coupable
de ce que les gamins...
C'est mes affaires!
C'est le comble!
Interdisons Bender à la télé!
Arrêtons Bender!
Ça va trop loin!
Pour qui me prend-on?
- Ouais!
- Juste!
Marchons sur Hollywood,
qu'ils arrêtent de nous infliger
ce robot dégueu!

La réponse est un "non" catégorique

- Je démissionne!

Tu vas finir la scène.
Vas-y fort.
C'est fini!
On peut avoir recours à la violence!
- Ca marchera?
- J'ai vu ca à la télé
quand Bender tue Calculon.
Trop cool.
Ouais! Vas-y!
- Démissionne!
- Fais la scène.
Je suis un voyou sans pitié!
J'ai mis des faux rires
dans un sitcom sans blagues.
- L'accessoiriste a une lampe!
- Vraiment?
C'est à moi!
Je vais faire un discours-clé.
Caméras!
- Réalisateur, situation!
- Colère.
Téléspectateurs,
fumer et boire à la télé
me rendent vraiment cool?
Bien sûr!
Et les délits, la violence?
Encore, oui.
Mais nos enfants doivent vraiment
voir ces ordures?
Je dis non!
D'un autre côté,
la faute est aux parents.
C'est vrai, vous!
Je vous pose la question:
Avez-vous essayé d'éteindre la télé,
de vous asseoir avec eux,
et de les frapper?
- On n'a pas le temps.
- Prenez-le.
Coupez!
Faites un montage
avec des plans de moi et diffusez.
Avez-vous essayé d'éteindre la télé,
de vous asseoir avec eux,
et de les frapper?
On a tous appris
une bonne lecon sur la télé.
Laquelle?
Qu'on devrait prendre la télé
moins au sérieux.
Et l'éteindre de temps en temps.
- Ouais!
- C'est vrai!
Là, on l'éteint?
Ça dépend de ce qu'il y a.
- Rien de bien.
- On continue à regarder.

J'ai pris des leÁons.
Des lecons! Riche idťe!
Tu ne devrais pas abandonner l'espoir

Je sais bien,

- Vous Ítes vraiment un robot?
- Je prťfŤre le terme "love machine".
Votre gosse est douť.

- Assez fort.

Il est trop grognon!
Non! Non! ArrÍtez! Stop!
M. Bender,
je refuse d'enseigner ŗ votre enfant.
Alors bonne journťe, madame!
Venez prendre le thť chez nous
quand vous voulez.
C'est sans espoir.
J'entends la musique dans ma tÍte,
mais mes mains ne suivent pas.
Tu sais ce qui me dťride?
Rire du malheur des autres!
Salut.
Vous avez ratť une super livraison.
- Oý ťtiez-vous?
- A un concert.
C'ťtait du jazz?
Mon ex, Shawn, jouait du saxo.
Je l'ťcoutais des heures
improviser nu sur mon canapť.
Les musiciens te font
tourner la tÍte, hein?
Oui. C'est bizarre.
Shawn n'avait ni ťducation ni ambition.
- Il ťtait p‚le et bossu.
- Un joli cúur.
Mais quand il jouait, je sentais
son incroyable et superbe ‚me crťatrice.
Un jour, j'ai dťcouvert qu'il improvisait
sur le canapť d'une autre.
J'avais peine ŗ y croire.
Vraiment...
Ce pourrait Ítre moi,
assis nu sur son canapť.
Si seulement j'arrivais ŗ en jouer.
Oh, mais tu peux.
Mais il faudra pactiser
mťtaphoriquement avec le dťmon.
Par dťmon, j'entends Robot Dťmon.
Et par mťtaphoriquement,
j'entends: On y va.
Ta derniŤre fausse note

Reprenons depuis le dťbut.
Bender! Fry!
De retour

Ce n'est pas une visite religieuse.
Fry veut des leÁons d'holophone.
Je dois devenir un pro
sans m'entraÓner.
L'enfer est rempli de gamins
qui voulaient la mÍme chose.
Malheureusement,
tu as ce que ma vieille prof,
Mme Mellonger,
appelle "des doigts stupides".
Avec de telles mains,
tu sais ŗ peine boucler ta ceinture.
Ce ne serait pas bien si tu avais
des mains de robot ŗ la place?
Bien sŻr. Tant pis. Au revoir.
Fry, espŤce d'idiot.
Je crois qu'il est d'accord
pour pactiser avec toi.
Vraiment? Super!
- Attendez, Áa cache quoi?
- Rien.
Je prendrai un robot au hasard
dans l'univers,
un que tu ne connais pas,
je lui prendrai ses mains
et les ťchangerai avec les tiennes.
Je suis comme ca.
- Alors?
- Je ne sais pas.
- «a ne semble pas trŤs moral...
- Si tu n'acceptes pas tout de suite,
je ne te respecterai plus

Bon, d'accord.

Et... redonne-moi mes mains!
Ces choses me tripotent sans cesse
ŗ certains endroits.
Oui, elles sont baladeuses.
Mais on a fait un marchť.
- J'ai g‚chť un ticket de bus.
- Exact.
SALLE
DE CON-CERVEAU …LECTRONIQUE
Vous pouvez entendre Philip Fry,
le virtuose de l'holophone,
jouant 900 de ces thŤmes classiques,
chez vous sur ce coffret 2 disques.
Plus de 30 mn de musique
pour seulement 14,99 $.
14,99 $ pour un coffret 2 disques.
2 disques!
Oh, Zoidberg, tu deviens enfin
un consommateur astucieux.
AllŰ? J'en prends huit!
- Un M. Hťdonisme-bot veut vous voir.
- Qu'il entre.
- TrŤs bien.
- Oh, Fry! Fťlicitations!
Votre concert m'a fait le mÍme bien
que tremper mon derriŤre
encore et encore dans un bain
d'huiles et de crŤmes soyeuses.
Merci.
C'ťtait exactement l'effet voulu.
Vous Ítes le rayon de soleil
de cette p‚le et triste saison.
J'aimerais donc
vous commander un opťra.
- Mais je n'ai jamais ťcrit d'opťra.
- Et je n'en ai jamais entendu.
Nťanmoins, si vous m'amusez
durant l'ouverture,
ce sera un succŤs fracassant.
Mais que pourrais-je ťcrire?
A moins que...
C'est d'accord.
Si je peux le faire sur Leela.
Moi? Vraiment?
Un homme ťcrivant un opťra
sur une femme?
Seigneur. Dťlicieusement absurde.
Je vous verrai ŗ la premiŤre.
- «a fait partie de l'opťra?
- N'ťcoute pas.
- Pas avant que je l'aie terminť.
- Mais c'est si beau.
Un paon aussi,
mais on le mange pas cru.
Ce doit Ítre parfait.
Tu dois entendre ce que j'entends
quand je pense ŗ toi.
Oh, Fry. Tout ce temps,
tu avais ce don et je l'ignorais.
J'ai ťtť sotte. Une sotte
prudente et tout ŗ fait justifiťe.
- Elles sont si froides!
- Et pourtant, l'enfer est si chaud!
- Je peux rťcupťrer mes mains?
- Non!
Tu n 'es pas sympa!
Bender, c'est une surprise.
Pour toi, de me trouver dans le frigo!
Au moins, je n'ai plus le hoquet.
Quoi de neuf?
Eh bien, j'ai envie de faire
un marchť avec toi.
- Oublie. Tu ne me tenteras pas.
- Vraiment? Tu ne dťsires rien?
J'avais oubliť
que tu pouvais me tenter.
Je me suis toujours demandť
ce que Áa ferait d'Ítre plus ťnervant.
Rien de plus simple.
Je ne demande en retour que tes mains
pour remplacer ces maigres saucisses.
Attrapo et Palpi? Jamais!
Je les adore!
Autre chose
dont tu veux te sťparer?
Non! Rien! Pas question.
Super! Avec ce klaxon incorporť,
je peux vraiment ťnerver les gens!
Et ca ne m'a coŻtť
que ma plaque d'entrejambe.
Tu es vraiment habile en affaires,
Bender.
Allez, trouve quelqu'un et assourdis-le.
Ouais! Ca donnera une lecon
ŗ la 1re personne que je verrai.
Mon plan follement dťtournť
est achevť ŗ 25%.
C'est la premiŤre demain soir.
Je vais me trouver des gants
adaptťs ŗ mes ťnormes avant-bras.
- Assez ťnervant, hein?
- Quoi? Tu parles?
Oh, mon Dieu, je suis sourde!
Je suis vraiment dťsolť.
Je voulais juste t'ťnerver.
Quoi? C'est horrible!
Je ne pourrai pas entendre
l'opťra de Fry.
Que c'est dťlicieusement ironique!
C'est pas ironique. C'est mťchant.
Prends ca:
Plus d'aťrosol. Egalement ironique.
Ah oui?
Parle ŗ ma brillante plaque...
Oh, non!
OP…RA-TION
GRANDE PREMIERE
LEELA: ORPHELINE DES …TOILES
Fry ne doit rien savoir.
S'il savait que je suis sourde,
ca lui briserait le cúur.
D'ac, la sourde.
Courtisanes et doux dandys,
bienvenue ŗ mon opťra.
Faisons les fous tels les Grecs de jadis.
Vous savez de qui je parle.
- Hourra!
- Ouais, Fry!
Je regarde la tťlť avec lui!
SCENE 1: LORSQUE LEELA
EST TROUV…E A L'ORPHELINAT
Qui est ce bťbť femelle ŗ un úil?
Quel courage rebelle
Dans son sourire de bťbť femelle
Un sauveur venu de l'au-delŗ
Ou un truc plus ťtrange que Áa?
Ou simplement une enfant seule,
Sale et affamťe?
Amy, Fry me regarde.
Que suis-je censťe ressentir?
CARTES D'…MOTIONS
Leela, Leela, Leela, tu dois le sauver
Sauve Fry, sauve Fry
Godzilla va le dťvorer
Moi, je pars, au revoir ŗ vous
Je vois mon docteur pour ma toux
Au revoir
Je ne me souviens pas m'Ítre battu
avec Godzilla. Mais c'est tout ŗ fait moi.
Entracte
Un double martini light,
s'il vous plaÓt.
- Et pour vous?
- Un diabolo chanvre.
Extra! Extra! Le plus grand opťra
du monde ŗ moitiť terminť!
A moitiť terminť?
- Je donnerais tout pour entendre la fin.
- Tout?
Merci, monsieur.
Tout, disais-je?
Je peux vous donner
de nouvelles oreilles robotiques.
Quoi?
De nouvelles oreilles?
Attendez. Que voulez-vous
d'apparemment raisonnable en ťchange?
- Vos mains, c'est tout, ma chŤre.
- Oubliez, alors.
Bon, d'accord. Juste une main.
Juste ma main gauche?
- L 'acte 2 va dťbuter.
- Je n'ai pas fini de vomir!
C'est trop dur!
- D'accord! Prenez-la.
- Formidable! Signez ici.
Calculon, mon vieil ami,
il me faut tes oreilles.
Je te suis redevable de m'avoir donnť
ce profane talent d'acteur!
J'entends!
Comme un perceur de coffre-fort!
- Vous ne prenez pas ma main?
- En temps voulu. Profitez de l'opťra.
Pour gagner le cúur de Leela la bonne
Avec l'art de l'holophone
Il me faut des mains
D 'une rapiditť transcendantale
Eh bien, je ne vois pas de danger
A marchander avec un ťtranger
Car ma tÍte est
D 'une ťpaisseur qui me sera fatale
Je suis stupide, je suis stupide
Plus stupide que toi
Je suis plus stupide que toi
Personne ne le niera
Plus stupide? Cet opťra
est aussi nul qu'il est gťnial!
Tes paroles
manquent de subtilitť.
Les personnages ne peuvent pas
annoncer leurs sentiments.
- Ca m'ťnerve!
- Que veux-tu?
Je veux rťcupťrer mes mains
Jamais!
Un marchť est un marchť
MÍme avec un sale marchand
TrŤs bien, alors je prendrai
Ce que je veux de Leela
Leela m 'a promis sa main
Fry, tu ne comprends pas bien
J'aurais dŻ rťvťler
Ma rťcente surditť
La honte, la honte
Je craignais que tu cesses de crťer
Cette splendeur musicale
Dťception et malťdiction sont nťes
Car je suis une horrible femme fatale
Il m 'a donnť des oreilles mťcaniques
Efficaces, mais pas trŤs esthťtiques
En ťchange, sans montrer mon chagrin
J'ai promis de lui donner ma main
- En mariage
- Quoi?
Tu m 'ťpouseras
Est-ce la rťalitť
Ou ils ne font que jouer?
- Ce ne peut Ítre la rťalitť
- Pas si Leela est fiancťe
Ce n 'est pas notre marchť
Ce n 'est pas ce que j'ai signť
Il aurait fallu que tu te mťfies
Des termes ťcrits en petits
CaractŤres
- "Je vous donnerai ma main..."
- En mariage
"L 'utilisation de mots pouvant exprimer
Autre chose que leur sens premier"
«a, c'est de l'ironie
Maintenant, je vais l'ťpouser
Et en enfer l'enfermer
Que c'est drŰle, que c'est drŰle
Lŗ oý le Styx est une riviŤre de choc
Et pas seulement un groupe de rock
Bien qu'ils joueront ŗ notre rťception
Enfin, c'est ce que nous espťrons
A moins que Fry, ce cabotin,
Ne me rende mes mains
Le destin me fait souffrir
En me forÁant ŗ choisir
Entre la femme que je dťsire
Et les mains de ce satyre
Sans ces mains je ne peux achever
L 'opťra qui l'a captivťe
Mais si je dťcide de les garder
Elle devra l'ťpouser
Et il refusera sŻrement
Que je sois son amant
Bravo! Encore!
Je n 'arrive pas ŗ croire que le diable
Ainsi les martyrise
Je n 'arrive pas ŗ croire
Que tout le monde ainsi improvise
Par les pouvoirs qui me sont confťrťs
Par l'Etat de New New York
Non! Stop! Prends mes mains!
EspŤce de sale tÍte de torque
De la chirurgie dans un opťra?
Follement dťcadent!
Juste au moment
oý je commenÁais ŗ m'ennuyer.
Jombee, le glaÁage au chocolat.
Oh, oui, c'est bon.
Mes mains!
Mes horribles mains humaines!
- Et qu'as-tu fait ŗ mes ongles?
- Je les ai nettoyťs.
Je vous laisse. J'ai une soirťe poker
et je me sens en veine.
Je retourne en enfer.
RamŤne-toi, Nixon!
Moins de rťalitť, plus de fantaisie!
Que l'opťra reprenne!
Mais je ne peux plus jouer!
Mais si! La beautť ťtait dans ton cúur,
pas dans tes mains!
La musique est mauvaise
et tu devrais te sentir mal!
Extra! Extra! Le plus grand opťra
de tous les temps craint!
J'en prends huit.
Ne t'arrÍte pas de jouer, Fry.
Je veux entendre comment ca finit.

frais comme des gardons,</i>
<i>Futurama n'ayant jamais été annulé
par des débiles,</i>
<i>ni ramené par d'autres débiles.</i>
Un...
Deux...
Professeur, mon Afry est tout frisé.
C'est tout. Aussi,
j'ai des brulures sévčres.
Ouais, et alors ?
Pourquoi j'ai tout ça ?
Tu te souviens de rien ?
Rien du tout.
Comme mon blackout ŕ la fac.
Mais lŕ, j'ai pas de pénis dessinés
sur ma tęte.
C'est sűrement mieux,
vu les horreurs que tu as endurées.
N'en parlons plus jamais.
Tout commença
il y a quelques jours.
<i>Nous étions des fugitifs stellaires,</i>
<i>fuyant la loi.</i>
Que toutes nos armes tirent,
et ouvrez un canal
pour mon cri de la victoire.
<i>Alors que tu embrassais Leela
pour la derničre fois,</i>
<i>avec une superbe tendresse linguale,</i>
<i>nous plongeâmes dans un trou de ver,</i>
<i>et disparűmes ŕ jamais !</i>
Nous revoilŕ.
Nom d'une coďncidence
digne de Port-Au-Prince !
- Voilŕ la Terre !
- Normal !
C'était le trou de ver du Panama,
la principale chaîne de transport
de la Terre.
Quelle bonne blague.
Oui, c'est un peu la chaîne
de Comedy Central.
On passe dessus !
J'ai compris !
Perte de puissance
sur la Game Boy avant !
Mario ne répond pas !
Procédure d'atterrissage forcé !
Compris !
Activez vos sphčres protectrices !
La mienne a l'air conditionné.
Grâce ŕ ma sphčre protectrice,
j'ai surbécu ŕ de tribiales
lésions cérévriales.
- Et les autres ?
- Derričre ce rideau de l'horreur.
Tous morts ?
Bien pire.
Bouge de lŕ !
Que vienne la résurrection !
Mauvais interrupteur.
Allez, mes cellules souches,
montrez le résultat
de votre absurdité scientifique !
Des cellules foetales ?
C'est pas mal vu ?
Ŕ ton époque, oui.
Mais aujourd'hui, ta gueule !
En plus,
ce sont des cellules adultes,
récoltées sur des adultes
en parfaite santé,
que j'ai tués exprčs pour ça.
Hermes Conrad !
Je suis couvert de placenta !
Ça va, c'est Friday wear.
Amy Wong !
Comme un bébé !
En effet !
Dr Zoidberg !
Hermes, mon ami !
Laisse-moi couper
ton cordon ombilical.
Les retardataires !
On est de retour !
Faudra me passer sur le corps.
C'est pas grave.
Bender,
les cellules souches fonctionnent ?
Je me meurs.
- Vite, un bouche-ŕ-cul.
- Compte sur moi !
Ça marche pas !
Je meurs heureux,
sachant que tu l'as fait.
Ses batteries sont mortes !
Son cardio est ŕ plat !
Une seule chose peut le sauver.
Sűrement ça !
Je pčte le feu comme jamais !
C'est mon outil d'Apocalypse,
il t'envoie 50 gigawatts
dans le corps !
C'est dix fois la norme...
T'es pas mon pčre, d'accord ?
Qu'elle est bonne...
Nom de Dieu, Bender !
Continue ŕ danser !
Ne t'arręte pas !
Tu dois brűler l'énergie
aussi vite qu'elle se crée,
ou elle atteindra
un seuil critique !
Vous dites...
C'est ça.
Ne t'arręte jamais de danser,
sinon tu tueras tout le monde
en explosant,
dans un festival de métaux
et d'entrailles !
C'est parti pour la fęte !
En parlant d'entrailles,
ça te dit un dîner romantique,
Leela ?
Oů est Leela ?
Elle va bien ?
Pourquoi elle réagit pas
ŕ ma proposition ?
Quelque chose cloche !
Elle ne réagit pas ŕ mon bâton !
Tapez plus fort !
Je peux pas faire plus fort !
Désolé, Fry,
mais je crains que Leela soit...
dans un coma irréversible !
Mon âme soeur n'est plus !
Pourquoi continuer ŕ vivre ?
Parce que la douleur s'estompe,
mais l'amour dure toujours.
Et si j'oublie
le doux son de sa voix,
ou la sensation poisseuse
de mes lčvres sur son oeil ?
Tu te souviens encore de son nom ?
Passe ŕ autre chose !
- T'as peut-ętre raison.
- C'est peut-ętre toujours le cas !
<i>Atelier Fais-Ton-Robot</i> ?
Il est temps
de reprendre ma vie en main !
Au moins, je penserai moins ŕ Leela.
Je préfčre comme ça, bizarrement.
J'aime les bonbons !
- Et toi ?
- Oui, chérie.
Allez, Fry !
Cette romance impossible
est inacceptable !
Surtout sans notre aide.
Il y a des caméras
partout dans le Planet Express :
dans le vaisseau,
les douches, et les toilettes.
Ça n'a pas arręté
ce voleur des toilettes.
Il nourrit peut-ętre sa famille.
Ordinateur, extrais ŕ partir
des enregistrements le profil de
Turanga Leela.
<i>Analyse.</i>
<i>Analyse.</i>
<i>Vérification de mon enchčre eBay.
Et merde !</i>
<i>Analyse terminée.</i>
On faisait un câlin !
<i>Transfert en cours.</i>
<i>Pointure 47, etc.</i>
Procédure d'atterrissage forcé !
On a survécu au crash ?
Tout le monde dans la salle dit...
C'est super !
Mourir dans une explosion
était mon dernier souvenir.
Et je suis lŕ en chair et en os,
plus vivante que jamais !
Vivante ?
- Tu devrais lui dire, Fry.
- Quoi ?
Mon boulot est terminé.
Je vais prendre une douche.
Nibbler,
viens faire un câlin ŕ maman !
Qu'est-ce que... Méchant Nibbler !
Pourquoi, choupinou ?
C'est moi, Leela !
Je ne suis qu'un robot ?
Mais j'ai ses souvenirs,
son avis sur les gazelles,
majestueuses, ses émotions...
perdue et blessée.
Je ne savais pas
que ça allait arriver.
La seule chose que je sais,
c'est que je t'aime.
Enfin, elle.
Je m'enfonce.
- Sans fesson.
- Faites-le !
En fait, Fry,
j'éprouve quelque chose pour toi.
Mais ces sentiments sont-ils réels ?
Suis-je un simple robot ?
Ou une machine complexe
peut-elle avoir une conscience ?
C'est vrai.
Je dois y réfléchir.
Pour l'instant, restons amis.
Écoutez, les abrutis !
Vous ętes virés
de la Bender Fiesta Académie !
C'est la danse du dos,
la danse du dos.
Bonne nouvelle !
Je vais tenter une derničre fois
de réveiller Leela.
Il reste toujours de l'espoir.
- Vraiment ?
- Ne l'espčre pas.
Pour l'instant, c'est juste un tas
de croűtes et de pus.
J'avais pas ŕ entendre ça.
Et tu ne devrais pas voir ça.
<i>Debout ! Debout !</i>
C'est fini.
La médecine traditionnelle a échoué.
Je n'abandonnerai pas !
Debout, Leela !
- Je t'aime !
- Arręte, Fry.
C'est fini.
Dr Zoidberg,
pouvez-vous déclarer
l'heure du décčs ?
Si je peux ?
C'est ma spécialité !
Comme vous le savez,
Leela voulait qu'en cas de coma,
son corps soit mangé
par le cyclophage,
une créature en voie d'extinction
qui mange les cyclopes.
C'est sur sa carte de donneur.
Adieu, mon amour.
Voilŕ la bęte !
Tous en rythme !
Tous en rythme !
Je danse le gig tout en rythme !
Bender, ferme-la !
On essaie d'ętre triste !
Tu crois que j'en ai pas marre
de faire la fęte ?
On continue !
- Chut, Bender !
- La ferme !
Coupe ton sale micro !
Bender, rallume ton micro !
C'est vrai.
Leela est vivante, hyper cool.
Enfin, Leela !
C'est bon de se réveiller
pour voir...
C'est pas possible !
En plus, elle porte un marcel
ŕ mes funérailles !
La ferme, il faut partir !
Toi, la ferme, il faut partir !
Tous dans le fęte-sseau.
Y a pas la place
pour deux capitaines !
Il y en aurait
si t'avais fait de la gym
au lieu de tomber dans le coma.
C'est fou !
J'ai l'impression de regarder
une copie robotique de moi-męme.
C'est le cas.
Comment t'as pu, Fry ?
Le coma... triste...
Je m'en vais.
C'est trop bizarre.
Ne te fâche pas, Leela.
Elle n'est pas toi.
Je m'en vais.
C'est trop bizarre.
J'ai besoin de m'amuser, Bender.
Tu veux qu'on sorte faire la fęte ?
J'ai horreur de ça.
Si seulement j'avais moins d'énergie
dans mes bougies.
Pourquoi je foire
avec toutes mes copines ?
J'aime Leela.
Pour toute la vie.
Et si j'aimais le robot Leela,
c'est parce qu'il me rappelait Leela.
Je pensais que c'était réciproque.
- Mais j'avais tort, comme toujours.
- Faux.
T'avais raison.
Leela ? Leela Leela ?
J'ai réfléchi, Fry.
Si je te perdais,
je ne le supporterais pas non plus.
Je ferais aussi une copie de toi.
Tant que le robot Leela
n'a pas ma jalousie, tout ira...
Je vais te tuer, salope !
Il est ŕ moi !
Du calme, traînée !
Faites quelque chose !
Prends ça.
Un pistolet ? Je dois...
C'est elle, le robot.
Tire !
C'est elle, l'humaine.
Tire sur elle !
Mais comment vous différencier ?
- On vient de le dire !
- Ouais, abruti !
D'accord.
Si c'est comme ça,
je tire sur personne.
Juste entre les poumons.
C'était chaud.
Je suis un robot !
Cela explique l'excroissance
sur votre arbre ŕ cames.
- Comment est-ce possible ?
- Qui sait ?
Moi. Je vais vous expliquer
ce qui s'est vraiment passé
le jour du crash.
Je te protégerai, Leela.
Mon amour est plus fort
que n'importe quelle explosion.
<i>Fry a bien sauvé Leela,</i>
<i>ŕ un prix énorme.</i>
<i>Je l'ai jeté
dans les cellules souches</i>
<i>mais il s'est dissout,
comme une aspirine dans l'eau.</i>
<i>Leela était effondrée,</i>
<i>alors elle est allée au magasin
fabriquer une copie.</i>
<i>Elle a téléchargé
la personnalité de Fry</i>
<i>grâce aux enregistrements
des toilettes.</i>
J'aime Leela.
<i>Hélas, lors de la création
de la copie de Fry</i>
<i>elle avait mis trop
de ouate de cuivre.</i>
<i>Une décharge a électrocuté Leela,</i>
<i>et effacé la mémoire ŕ court terme
des deux amants.</i>
C'est pour ça que je suis étonné
de savoir ce que je sais.
<i>Que faire ?</i>
<i>J'ai mis Leela
avec les autres sacs d'os</i>
<i>et ajouté le dernier ingrédient
de ma mixture.</i>
Professeur, mon Afry est tout frisé.
Je peux pas croire
que je ne reverrai jamais Fry.
Et mes pompes ?
Désolé.
Je savais pas que j'étais lŕ.
Pourquoi y a deux Leela ?
Cherche pas.
OK, abruti.
Bon, je vais aux toilettes,
parler de ma vie...
Attends.
Il reste des choses ŕ régler.
En fait,
j'aime Fry.
- Celui-lŕ.
- Et j'aime Leela.
Toutes.
On est des robots amoureux.
Enlevons ces sacs de viande.
Hasta la vista, les losers.
On reviendra. Pour notre tâche.
Pourquoi leur voix a changée ?
C'est un mystčre incompréhensible.
C'est assez étrange.
Non ?
Je sais pas...
Je suivais plus
ŕ partir du second robot.
Tu sais ce que je ressens.
Je t'ai attendue mille ans.
Un peu plus ne me dérange pas.
C'est bon, j'en ai marre !
Il va exploser !
Fais la fęte, Bender !
Fais-la pour survivre !
Pas question, les cons.
Je préfčre tous nous tuer
que faire la fęte une autre seconde !
Le cyclophage !
Attends, mon pote !
Je suis pas un cyclope !
Je suis invincible ou quoi ?
Bender, tu t'es débarrassé
du surplus d'énergie.
Tu es guéri !
Dieu merci !
Ce cauchemar est fini !
Je ferai plus jamais la fęte !
C'est d'accord.
On est de retour !
En avant la fęte !
<i>On the count of three,
you will awake feeling refreshed,</i>
<i>as if Futurama
had never been cancelled by idiots,</i>
<i>then brought back by bigger idiots.</i>
One...
two...
Professor, my fry-fro is all frizzy.
Well, that's all.
Also,
I'm covered with severe burns.
So? What of it?
Why is... those things?
You mean you don't remember?
Nope, nothing.
It's like when I passed out in college.
Except no one drew magic marker penises
on my forehead.
I suppose it's for the best,
considering the unbearable horrors
you've endured.
Let's never speak of it again.
It all began a few days ago.
<i>We were interstellar fugitives,</i>
<i>on the run from the law.</i>
Fire all weapons
and open a hailing frequency
for my victory yodel.
<i>And so,
as you and Leela kissed good-bye</i>
<i>in a tender display
of tonguesmanship,</i>
<i>we plunged into a massive wormhole,</i>
<i>never to be seen again!</i>
Yeah, we're back.
Sweet coincidence of Port-Au-Prince!
- We're back at Earth!
- Of course!
That was the Panama wormhole,
Earth's central channel
for shipping.
How humorous.
Yes! It's sort
of a comedy central channel.
And we're on it now!
I get it!
We've lost power
to the forward gameboy!
Mario not responding!
Brace for emergency landing!
Roger that!
Activate safety spheres!
Also, mine has air-conditioning.
Yet thanks
to my trusty safety sphere,
I "surblibed"
with only "tribial" brain "dablage."
- And the others?
- Right here behind this horror cloth.
Are they dead?
Much worse.
Move over, God!
Prepare for rebirth!
Wrong switch.
Come on, stem cells,
work your astounding
scientific nonsense!
Fetal stem cells?
Aren't those controversial?
In your time, yes.
But nowadays, shut up!
Besides, these are adult stem cells,
harvested from perfectly
healthy adults
whom I killed for their stem cells.
Hermes Conrad!
I'm dripping with placenta!
Good thing it's casual Friday.
Amy Wong!
Baby soft!
Indeed!
Dr. Zoidberg!
Hermes, my friend!
Let me cut off your umbilical cord.
And the rest!
We're back in business!
Over my dead body.
Never mind.
Bender! Are the stem cells working?
I'm dyin'.
- I need mouth-to-ass resuscitation.
- I'm on it!
It's not working!
I die happy,
knowing you fell for that.
His power supply is shot!
He's flatlining!
Only one thing can keep him alive.
Possibly this thing!
I've never felt so energetic!
That's because the doomsday device
I shoved all up
in you puts out 50 gigawatts!
That's ten times your recommended...
Who are you, my warranty?
That's a good...
For God sakes, Bender!
Keep dancing!
Keep whooping it up!
You must burn off the doomsday energy
as fast as its produced,
or it will build to critical levels!
You don't mean...?
But I do.
If you stop partying
for a single second,
you'll explode
and kill everyone here
in a fireball of melted gears
and splatter bowels!
Sounds like a party, baby!
Speaking of splattered bowels,
can I cook you
a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?
Where's Leela?
Is she okay?
Why hasn't she acknowledged
my dinner offer?
Something's wrong!
She's not responding to my poking stick!
Poke harder, damn it!
I'm poking as hard as I can!
I'm sorry, Fry,
but I'm afraid Leela is in...
An irreversible coma!
My soul mate is gone!
Why should I go on living?
Because the pain slowly fades,
but the love is forever.
But what if I forget
the sweet sound of her voice,
or the moist touch of her eyeball
on my lips?
Are you still hung up
on what's her name? Move on already!
- Maybe you're right.
- Maybe I'm always right!
"Build-a-bot workshop"?
It's time to start living again!
At least it's something
to distract me from Leela.
Now that I like, for some reason.
I like jelly beans!
- Do you?
- I sure do, honey.
Come, now, Fry!
You can't live out
this sick fantasy!
Not without our help.
These security tapes record everything
at planet express,
including the ship,
shower and urinals.
And yet, it still hasn't stopped
the elusive bathroom burglar.
Maybe he's just trying

I was dying in an explosion.
Yet here I am in the flesh,
more alive than ever!
Alive?
- You better tell her, Fry.
- Tell me what?
Anyway, my work is done.
I'm gonna hit the showers.
Nibbler, come give mama a hug!
What the...
Bad Nibbler! Bad Nibbler!
What you doing, pooper-doodle?
It's me, Leela!
Am I really just a robot?
I mean, I have Leela's memories,
her opinion of gazelles,
majestic, her emotions...
confused and hurt.
I swear,
I didn't know this would happen.
The only thing I truly know is,
I love you.
Her. Wait.
Help me out here.
- No, spank you.
- I said do it!
The truth is, Fry,
I still have feelings for you.
But are they really my feelings?
Am I just an automaton?
Or can a machine
of sufficient complexity
legitimately achieve consciousness?
I agree.
I need some time to figure this out.
Until then...
friends?
Listen up, disco dummies!
You just flunked out of Bender's
College of Party Knowledge!
Do the back dance,
do the back dance.
Good news, everyone.
I'm going to make one final attempt
to awaken Leela.
After all, there's always hope.
- Really?
- No, don't get your hopes up.
Frankly, she's just a brainless mound
of scabs and pus.
I didn't need to hear that.
No, and you don't need to see this.
<i>Wake up! Wake up!</i>
Well, that's it.
I'm afraid traditional medicine
has failed.
I refuse to give up!
Wake up, Leela!
I...
love...
- you!
- Fry, stop.
She's gone.
Dr. Zoidberg,
can you note the time
and declare the patient legally dead?
Can I!
That's my specialty!
As you all know,
Leela's living will states that,
in the event of coma,
her body is to be fed
to the wild cyclophage,
a highly endangered creature
that eats only cyclopses.
Yup, that's what
her donor card says.
Good-bye, my love.
The beast approacheth!
To the beat, y'all!
To the beat, y'all!
I'm dancin' a jig
with my feet, y'all!
Bender, cut it out!
People are trying to have emotions!
You think I want to party?
I'm sick of partying!
More partying!
- Quiet, Bender!
- Cut it out!
Shut the hell up!
Bender, stop shutting the hell up!
Oh, right.
Leela's back,
as if I care.
All right, Leela!
Thanks.
It's so nice to wake up and see...
How is this possible?
And can you believe
she wore a tank-top to my funeral?
We've got to get out of here!
No, you shut up.
We've got to get out of here!
All aboard the party ship.
There's no room for two captains
in this chair!
There would be
if you'd taken a spin class
instead of lounging around
in a coma.
This is crazy.
It's like I'm looking at
an exact robot duplicate of myself.
That is what you're looking at.
How could you do this, Fry?
Coma... sad...
I have to go.
This is just too freaky.
Please don't get upset, Leela.
She's nothing like you.
I have to go.
This is just too freaky.
I need cheering up, Bender.
I don't know.
You want to go out and party tonight?
I hate partying.
If only I didn't have so much crunk
in my badunkadunk.
Why does everything I date run away?
I love Leela.
Always and forever.
And if I loved robot Leela, too,
that's only 'cause she had so much
of real Leela in her.
I thought she loved me, too.
- But obviously, I was wrong, as usual.
- Wrong again.
You were right.
Leela? Leela Leela?
I've been thinking, fry.
If I lost you,
I don't think I could stand it,
either.
I'd probably build
a copy of you, too.
As long as robo Leela's not a jealous
type like me, things will work...
I'll kill you, you slut-clops!
He's mine!
Back off, missy!
Somebody do something!
Here, take this.
A gun? Do-do I really need to...?
Shoot her!
She's the robot!
No. Shoot her!
She's the human!
But how do I know who's the human
and who's the robot?
- We just told you!
- Yeah, you idiot!
Okay, fine.
If you're gonna be like that,
I'm not shooting anyone.
Right between the lungs.
Man, that was close.
I'm a robot, too!
That explains this growth
on your drive shaft.
- But how is this possible?
- Who knows?
I do.
Allow me to explain
what really happened
the day the ship crashed.
I'll protect you, Leela.
My love is stronger than
the vast majority of explosions.
<i>Fry did, in fact, save Leela,</i>
<i>though at a terrible cost
to himself.</i>
<i>I tossed him into the stem cells,</i>
<i>but he just bubbled away,
like phlegm on a hot sidewalk.</i>
<i>Leela was so distraught,</i>
<i>she went all blade runner
and built a duplicate.</i>
<i>Then uploaded Fry's personality</i>
<i>from the urinal surveillance tapes.</i>
I sure love Leela.
<i>Alas, in recreating
Fry's adorable jelly belly,</i>
<i>she had overstuffed him
with copper wadding.</i>
<i>The inevitable static discharge
electrocuted Leela,</i>
<i>and destroyed both
of their short-term memories.</i>
So that's why I'm so amazed
by these things I already knew.
<i>What to do?</i>
<i>I hung up Leela
with the other bone-bags</i>
<i>and went to procure the final ingredient
for my stem cell brew.</i>
Professor, my fry fro is all frizzy.
My God,
I can't believe I'll never see
that particular Fry again.
Where's my shoes?
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I was already here.
Wait.
What's with all the Leelas?
Trust me, don't ask.
Okay, dork.
I'm gonna hit the urinal,
maybe talk about myself a little bit...
Hang on.
It's time to sort things out.
The truth is,
I love fry.
- That fry.
- And I love Leela.
Any Leela.
We're robots, and we're in love.
Let's ditch these meat jackets.
Hasta la vista, Wiener.
We'll be back.
For our stuff.
Why did their voices change?
That's the one thing
we'll never truly understand.
This is a bit awkward.
Or is it?
I'm not sure...
I lost track
around the second robot.
You know how I feel.
I waited for you for a thousand years.
I can wait a little longer.
What a load of mush!
I've had it!
He's gonna blow!
Party, Bender!
Party for your life!
No chance, high pants.
I'd rather die
and kill all of you than party
for one more millisecond!
The cyclops eater!
Hold on, mack!
It ain't like that!
Geez, what does it take to kill me?
Bender, you blew out
your excess capacity.
You're cured!
Sweet mercy!
My hellish nightmare is over!
I never have to party again!
Well, that's that, then.
We're back, everyone!
Par-tay!

<i>Et voici...</i>
Les Incroyables Exploits
de Zapp Brannigan
<i>présentés par Bartley,
la cire pour fusée.</i>
J'astique ma fusée tous les jours.
Personne ne peut te sauver, Leela.
Et Zapp Brannigan ?
Bien sûr qu'il le pourrait, mais...
Empereur Coupe-Coupe,
nous nous rencontrons enfin.
Baissez votre arme spatiale
ou je tire... comme ça.
Attache-moi de nouveau
et capture-moi.
J'aimerais ça, donc je le ferai.
Bouge ton corps, bébé.
Vas-y, bouge.
Je me rends, prêt à la trahison.
Convocation urgente du président.
C'est toi.
Laisse-moi me rafraîchir.
Ordinateur, musc du capitaine.
Le long et dramatique corridor.
Jamais un bon signe.
<i>Gant reconnu.</i>
<i>Avancez, Mme Eisenhower.</i>
M. le président.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Repos, Brannigan.
Ce que vous allez voir
est hautement confidentiel.
Reptilicus, fais marcher le machin.
À 0-100 heures,
la planète X-3 a été attaquée
par une Sphère de la Mort.
Agrandis la Sphère de la Mort.
- Pourquoi c'est flou ?
- C'est la plus grande résolution.
Agrandir ne rend pas moins flou.
Si, dans <i>Les experts : Miami</i>.
Ils se sont battus
avec un équipement militaire avancé,
mais c'était comme
tirer à la carabine sur Bebe Rebozo.
Ce pauvre équipement courageux.
La Sphère a ensuite tiré
un rayon noir infernal,
et effacé cette planète
comme 18 minutes
de cassette compromettante.
J'aimerais comprendre pourquoi...
ça me concerne ?
Parce que la Sphère de la Mort
est en route vers la Terre.
Nous sommes sans défense,
comme un poisson dans un tonneau.
- Options ?
- Mon instinct me dit de me cacher
comme le poisson futé.
Nous n'avons plus qu'un espoir.
Une arme radicale construite
par un scientifique visionnaire
que j'ai traité de fou.
Voyons à quel point je suis fou.
La réponse correcte est "très fou".
C'est bon,
allez-y.
Nouvelle top secrète.
J'ai développé un vaisseau furtif
pour une personne
virtuellement indétectable.
À quel point ?
Il est juste là.
C'est dur...
à croire.
Comment un jouet Happy Meal
peut détruire
la Sphère de la Mort ?
De l'intérieur.
Ce vaisseau peut se faufiler
discrètement
dans la seule ouverture vulnérable
de la Sphère.
Il y en a une ?
Toutes les Sphères de la Mort
ont une ouverture vulnérable.
Qui est assez courageux
pour voler dans quelque chose
qu'on appelle Sphère de la Mort ?
- Je dis Brannigan.
- Je dis non.
- Je dis moi.
- Je dis Leela.
- Je dis oui.
- Je dis non.
Je dis aussi Leela.
Je dis encore oui.
Je dis que je l'accompagne.
Mais il ne peut contenir
qu'un homme. Je dis.
Il n'y aura qu'un homme... moi.
Je couvrirai tes arrières
en tant que mitrailleur de queue.
- T'en penses quoi ?
- C'est effrayant.
C'est décidé.
Pourquoi sur tes genoux ?
Ça nous aidera
à porter un meilleur coup.
Voilà des fruits pour le trajet.
Et aussi ce tableau
pour te souvenir de moi.
Garde-le.
Je reviens bientôt.
Activation du bouclier furtif.
- Décollage !
- C'est parti.
Quelqu'un d'autre
se sent excité, jaloux et inquiet ?
J'ai pas ressenti grand-chose
depuis la mort de mon cochon d'Inde.
Sphère de la Mort à portée,
démarrage du ciblage holographique.
Activation de la Force.
<i>Sens l'entrée, Leela.</i>
<i>Destination à gauche
dans </i>500<i> mètres.</i>
Zapp à Leela.
Regarde
cet équipement de surveillance.
Chuchotons.
Mode "confidences sur l'oreiller".
C'est quoi, ces immenses lettres ?
V-GINY ?
Ça me dit rien.
Ce V-GINY ne me dit rien qui vaille.
Quelqu'un reconnaît ces lettres ?
Pas non plus dans l'annuaire.
Déchiffrer ce code d'identificaton
est crucial.
Je serai dans
la Chambre de Compréhension.
Voilà le moment
pour lequel on aurait dû s'entraîner.
Bordel de m...
- Truc dégueu en approche.
- Lancement des mini-fusées !
Ne panique pas, Leela. Allez.
J'espère que c'est le bon manche.
Journal de bord,
nous avons perdu le contrôle. PS...
<i>Maintenant, la suite des...</i>
Incroyables Exploits
de Zapp Brannigan.
Chapitre deux :
"La Température Grimpe".
Réveille-toi.
Je ne peux affronter seul
cette planète,
sans toi ou quelqu'un comme toi.
Réveille-toi.
- On est où ?
- Écrasés sur une planète inconnue.
Je me suis réveillée
coincée sous cet arbre.
Tu m'aides ?
Si quelqu'un peut le bouger,
alors je peux.
Personne ne peut.
Tu es blessée ?
Non, mais j'ai si soif.
Cette combinaison
me fait suer à grosses gouttes.
Moi aussi.
On devrait les enlever
et vivre au naturel.
J'imagine.
On peut se couvrir de ces feuilles
collantes et couvertes de sève.
J'essaierai d'éviter
de regarder ta nudité.
Vraiment ?
À quoi ça sert ?
Tu devras bien regarder à un moment.
Je promets de ne pas abuser
de ce privilège.
Je ferais mieux d'aller chercher
des vivres et de l'aide.
C'est si prévenant et attentionné.
Ça va pas ?
Je suis pas sûr.
C'est peut-être l'air frais
ou une commotion.
Bref, j'y vais.
Un steak serait parfait.
Pourquoi Leela est absente ?
- Tu crois qu'elle va bien ?
- Comment savoir ?
Pourquoi tu demandes jamais
si je vais bien ?
Je me sens négligé.
- Ça va, Bender ?
- Ta gueule.
À quoi bon ?
Quand la Sphère de la Mort arrivera,
on finira en steak haché.
C'est le moment de céder
à la débauche de fin du monde.
Motivés par une orgie ?
Ou un jeu des petits chevaux ?
Oubliez ça.
J'ai identifié la Sphère de la Mort.
Nous avons peut-être
un petit espoir de survie.
Quand même, les petits chevaux.
Voici un satellite militaire
top secret
lancé par l'Air Force en 1998.
Et voici un satellite
de communication top secret
lancé la même année
pour censurer les programmes TV.
Comme <i>Les Simp-suce</i>
et <i>Fu-cul-rama ?</i> ?
Exactement.
Toutefois, ils se sont percutés
peu après leur lancement
et ont disparu.
J'ai trouvé le jeu !
Voici une simulation de la collision
utilisant la vision shrapnel.
D'accord, ça a l'air vrai.
Mais pourquoi cette Sphère
détruit des planètes ?
C'est ça, le plus sensé.
Regardez les planètes détruites.
D'abord X-3,
la planète des nudistes,
puis, Merdecure,
et enfin ce monde
qu'on ne mentionne pas
en bonne compagnie.
Vous voulez dire...
Comment oses-tu ?
Donc, la Sphère de la Mort
censure les planètes indécentes ?
Et nous sommes les suivants,
si on ne peut pas la garder rangée.
Notre seul espoir
est de persuader les terriens
d'abandonner l'obscénité.
Donc, l'orgie est annulée ?
J'ai si soif.
Pourquoi une fontaine
ne m'est pas tombée dessus ?
Je n'ai pas trouvé d'eau,
mais l'humidité de ces fruits
devrait suffire.
J'ai grimpé dangereusement haut
pour les attraper,
et je n'ai vu aucun signe
de vie intelligente.
Mince.
De plus, le crash
a totalement détruit le vaisseau.
On est coincés
jusqu'à ce qu'on nous trouve ?
Hélas, c'est peu probable.
Le camouflage du vaisseau
le rend impossible à localiser,
mais c'est facile de s'y cogner.
Il y a pire, comme endroit.
Plein de nourriture,
climat tempéré...
C'est un vrai Jardin d'Eden.
C'est vrai ?
Ce serpent a dit bonjour ?
Non, on délire
car on est déshydratés.
Tout comme Adam et Ève.
On peut encore sauver la Terre.
Les gens deviennent plus sérieux
quand des faits leur sont montrés
par des gens rationnels comme nous.
<i>La fin est proche !
Repentez-vous !</i>
J'y penserai,
tout en donnant 5 dollars
à cette prostituée.
<i>Arrêtez, ça vaut pas le coup !</i>
OK, donne-m'en que trois.
Je veux pas
de prostituée à 3 dollars !
Je retourne
à la bibliothèque pour adultes.
Pour adulte ? Je croyais
que c'était une bibliothèque publique.
Bibliothèque pubienne.
Où es-tu ?
Il commence à vraiment me manquer.
Vous êtes peut-être faits
l'un pour l'autre.
Non.
Et tu ne parles pas.
Allez.
Ça doit être une terrible tentation.
Devine qui a tué une marmotte
pieds nus ?
J'ai pensé à nous faire un abri.
Faire comme une maison.
La Terre me manque beaucoup.
Je me demande si elle est encore là.
Découvrons-le.
Je vais braver
l'épave du vaisseau
pour t'apporter le télescope.
C'est si gentil.
Je dis ça, je dis rien.
Ça a peu de chances de marcher,
mais c'est notre dernier espoir.
Maintenant, j'ai tout entendu.
Sur mon iPod.
Vous avez un plan, professeur ?
Il y a encore de l'espoir ?
Oui.
Voici la dernière zone terrienne
encore inaltérée,
pour montrer à la Sphère de la Mort
que la pureté existe encore sur Terre.
Commencez la transmission.
Commencez le chant de pureté.
Je suis fier de toi, Bender.
Éviter le pêché pendant une minute...
Ouais, bébé,
tu veux voir mon antenne ?
Doucement.
Que pourrait-il arriver de grave ?
Adieu, Terre !
On est les derniers humains
de l'Univers !
Je suis désolé, Leela.
C'était peut-être écrit
que toi et moi devions
construire un nouveau monde, ici.
On peut éviter
les erreurs de l'Humanité.
Comme le tuba.
On sera comme Adam et Ève.
Mais sans tuba.
Et le petit Zapp Junior naîtra.
Et Leela Junior,
puis ils auront leurs propres enfants.
C'est vraiment
ce qui est écrit dans la Bible ?
C'est un bouquin malsain
sur la sainteté.
Alors on écrira la nôtre.
Avec moins de Sodome
et plus de Gomorrhe.
Allons-y.
Je deviendrai
la mère d'un nouveau monde,
coincée ici, sous cet arbre.
L'Arbre de la Connaissance.
Il y a même des pommes !
Viens ici, Adam.
Je partage mon fruit défendu.
Et cela fut fait.
Attends. Encore une bouchée
avant de commencer la procréation.
Juteux.
Ces fruits étaient si salés,
j'en perdais mes esprits.
Sans vouloir me répéter,
c'était aussi salé
que le paquet que Fry m'a donné.
Tout aussi salé.
Une minute.
J'ai une terrible confession
à te faire.
Quand je suis allé
chercher à manger,
j'ai trouvé la carcasse fumante
du vaisseau.
Ignorant le danger,
je me suis précipité
afin de libérer les provisions.
Donc ça provient bien
du paquet de Fry !
J'ai exagéré en disant
que je les avais cueillis d'un arbre.
Je voulais que tu penses...
à moi en mieux.
Tes motifs étaient bons.
Et on est déshydratés et fous.
Attends.
Tu n'a pas arrêté d'uriner.
Il y a plein d'eau.
Après avoir sauvé altruistement
le paquet de fruits,
j'ai encore bravé les flammes
pour trouver à boire.
Pourquoi t'as tout bu ?
Je pensais que ça t'aiderait
à oublier ta haine pour moi
si tu te mettais à délirer un peu.
Tu me laisses me déshydrater
pendant que tu bois de l'eau
pour faire passer les fruits ?
Pas exactement.
Tu vois, en plus des fruits,
le mini-bar contenait des Doritos,
du boeuf séché,
et un assortiment de chocolats.
Je voulais te les offrir,
vraiment, mais j'étais préoccupé
par ton poids.
Très préoccupé.
J'ai pas fait beaucoup d'exercice.
Si seulement cet arbre
ne m'était pas tombé dessus...
Oh, Seigneur !
C'était juste après le crash.
Je me suis réveillé,
tu étais piégée.
Debout !
Tu aurais pu déplacer ce tronc
à tout moment ?
Bien sûr,
mais tu n'aurais pas eu besoin
que je m'occupe de toi.
Je te laisserais mourir ici
si le vaisseau n'était pas détruit.
Il fonctionne parfaitement,
c'est ça ?
Après t'avoir piégée à nouveau,
et avant de feindre l'inconscience,
j'ai fait une pause
et fumé un cigare.
La satisfaction et sa douceur
m'ont donné soif,
donc j'ai cherché du brandy.
C'est là que mon sens aigu
détecta le vaisseau encore invisible.
On peut retourner sur Terre ?
Mais la Terre a disparu !
Tout le monde est mort !
Ça a l'air bien
pour couler un bronze, ici.
Leela, tu es en vie !
Comment as-tu trouvé cette planète ?
Alors ?
On est sur Terre.
Le module de secours nous a ramenés.
Mais j'ai vu la Terre exploser.
Je suis plutôt fier de celle-là.
Ce que tu as vu
n'était qu'une simulation
que j'ai créée,
en utilisant le projecteur
de ciblage holographique.
Le pseudo télescope
était un rouleau de papier-toilette.
Tu as dit qu'il n'y en avait plus !
Et que l'humanité avait disparue !
Mes motifs était bons.
Je voulais te persuader
de sauver l'humanité
pour que tu couches avec moi.
Dis-moi que tu me crois.
Oui, je te crois.
Il doit y avoir un truc à voler
sur cette île.
C'est Leela !
Rentrons, tout le monde.
Au moins, le monde est sauf.
Pour l'instant.
<i>Terriens !</i>
<i>Écoutez la juste parole
du puissant V-GINY.</i>
Le puissant V-GINY !
<i>Vous voir batifoler
dans ce jardin inaltéré</i>
<i>m'a donné l'espoir que ce monde
mérite une seconde chance.</i>
Hourra !
Le chant de pureté a marché !
<i>Mauvais usage de vêtement,
inacceptable !</i>
<i>Je parlais d'Adam et Ève.</i>
On est pas Adam et Ève.
À cause d'une série de...
<i>Consommez votre union,</i>
<i>ou je détruirai la Terre.</i>
Si c'est pour la sauver...
je suppose que je peux me dévouer.
Quoi ? Maintenant ?
J'ai besoin de romance, d'abord.
D'une bougie à la vanille, ou autre.
<i>Commencez le rapport !</i>
Ces pistolets géants
me rendent un peu défaillant.
- Je ne sais pas si je peux...
- Dépêche.
J'ai du linge à laver.
Pour l'amour de Dieu, censurez-les !
<i>Approuvé pour tout public !</i>
<i>Et maintenant, le final épicé...</i>
<i>des</i> Incroyables Exploits
de Zapp Brannigan.
C'était juste,
mais on a sauvé la Terre.
C'était aussi bon pour toi
que pour la race humaine ?
Allons sauver une autre planète
tout de suite !

<i>And now...</i>
The transcredible exploits
of Zapp Brannigan
<i>brought to you
by Bartley's Rocket Wax.</i>
I wax my rocket every day.
No one can save you now, Leela.
What about Zapp Brannigan?
Well, obviously, Zapp Brannigan
could save you, but...
So, Emperor Chopchop,
once again, we meet at last.
Drop that space gun
or I'll shoot... like so.
Tie me back up and ravish me.
I'd like to, Leela, so I will.
Shake it, baby.
Shake it like...
I surrender
and volunteer for treason.
Emergency summons
from the president, Captain.
Oh, it's you.
Just let me freshen up.
Computer, captain's musk.
The long, dramatic corridor.
That's never a good sign.
<i>Glove recognized.</i>
<i>Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower.</i>
Mr. President.
What the hell?
At ease, Brannigan.
What you're about to see
is highly classified.
Reptilicus, hit the thingy.
At oh-zero-hundred hours,
Planet X-3 was attacked
by a mysterious Death-Sphere.
Magnify that Death-Sphere.
- Why is it still blurry?
- That's all the resolution we have.
Making it bigger
doesn't make it clearer.
It does on <i>CSI: Miami</i>.
They fought back
with advanced military hardware,
but it was like shooting
BBs at Bebe Rebozo.
That poor, brave hardware.
The Sphere then fired
some kind of hellish blackout ray.
Erased that planet
like 18 minutes of incriminating tape.
I just wish I understood why.
Why I should care.
Because the Death-Sphere
is now on course for Earth.
My God, we're defenseless,
like fish in a barrel.
- Options?
- My instinct is to hide in this barrel
like the wily fish.
Then we're down to our last hope:
a radical new weapon
built by a visionary scientist
I once dismissed as crazy.
Let's see how crazy I am now, Nixon.
The correct answer is "very."
All right, Professor,
sock it to me.
Top secret news, everyone.
I've developed a tiny,
one-man stealth fighter
that's virtually undetectable.
How undetectable?
It's in front of you.
I find that...
to believe.
But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy
going to destroy a giant Death-Sphere?
From within.
This ship should be able
to sneak, undetected,
through the Sphere's
one vulnerable opening.
What vulnerable opening?
All Death-Spheres
have one vulnerable opening.
Well, sure, but who's brave
enough to fly into something
we all keep calling a Death-Sphere?
- I say Brannigan.
- I say no.
- I say me.
- I say Leela.
- I say yes.
- I say no.
I say Leela, too.
I say yes again.
I say I shall join her.
But it's only a one-man craft.
I say.
There'll only be one man... me.
How would you feel if I rode rear
as your personal tail gunner?
Creeped out.
Then it's decided.
I have to sit in your lap?
It'll help us achieve
maximum thrust.
I made you some trail mix
for the flight.
Also, this picture, to remember me.
You hold onto it.
I'll be back soon.
Activating stealth shielding.
- Liftoff!
- I'll roger that.
Does anybody else feel aroused
and jealous and worried?
I haven't felt much of anything
since my guinea pig died.
Death-Sphere in range.
Engaging holographic targeting.
Activating the Force.
<i>Feel the entrance, Leela.</i>
Destination on your left
in 0.3 miles.
Zapp to Leela.
Look at all that surveillance equipment.
We better whisper.
Switching to pillow talk mode.
Look! What are those huge letters?
V- GINY?
Doesn't ring a bell.
I don't like
the looks of this V-GINY.
Does anyone recognize
those call letters?
Nope.
It's not in the Janeway's Guide.
Deciphering that I.D. code
is critical.
I'll be
in the Chamber of Understanding.
This is it... the moment
we should have trained for.
Holy cr...
Incoming yucky.
Firing pocket-rocket!
Don't panic, Leela.
Go, go.
I hope this is the control stick.
Captain's log. We've lost control.
Addendum...
<i>And now back to...</i>
The transcredible exploits
of Zapp Brannigan
Chapter Two: "The Heat Thickens".
Leela, wake up.
I can't face
this mysterious planet alone
without you or someone like you.
Zapp, wake up.
- Where are we?
- We crashed on an uncharted planet.
When I woke up,
I was pinned under this tree.
Help me!
If anyone can move it, I can.
No one can move it.
Are you hurt?
No, but I'm so thirsty.
This space suit is making me
sweat like a sow.
Me, too.
We'd better strip them off
and continue surving au naturel.
I suppose so.
Here, we can cover ourselves
with these sticky, sap-covered leaves.
I'll try to avert my eyes
from your nudery.
You will?
What's the point?
You'll have to look sooner or later.
Well, I promise
not to abuse the privilege.
For now I'd better scout around
for food and water and help.
What a thoughtful
and considerate thing to say.
What's wrong with you?
I'm not quite sure.
Perhaps it's the fresh air
or a severe head injury.
In any case, I'm off.
If you see any steaks,
that'd be good!
Why isn't Leela back yet?
- Do you think she's okay?
- How should I know?
And how come you never ask
if I'm okay?
I'm feeling a little neglected here.
- Are you okay, Bender?
- Shut up.
What difference does it make?
When that Death- Sphere gets here,
we'll all be blown to Manwich meat.
Well, I guess it's time to indulge
in some end-of-the-world debauchery.
Who's up for an orgy?
Maybe a Parcheesi tournament.
Belay that Parcheesi tournament.
I've identified the Death-Sphere.
We may yet have
a faint hope of survival.
Still, a Parcheesi tournament.
This is a top secret
military satellite
launched by the air force in 1998.
And this is a top
secret FCC satellite
launched that same year
to censor indecent TV programs.
Like <i>The Pimpsons</i> and <i>Ass-o-rama</i>?
Precisely.
However, the satellites collided
shortly after launch
and were never heard from again.
I found the board!
Now I've simulated that collision
using Shrapnel-vision.
Granted, all that makes
perfect sense.
But why is this Death-Sphere
destroying planets?
That makes the most sense of all.
Look at the planets
it's destroyed so far.
First came X-3
the nude beach planet,
then Poopiter,
and finally that world
that can't be mentioned
in polite company.
You mean...
How dare you.
So the Death-Sphere
is "censoring" indecent planets?
Indeed, and we're next,
if we can't keep it
in our collective pants.
Our sole hope
is to persuade the people of Earth
to abandon their smutty ways.
So the orgy's off?
So thirsty.
Why couldn't a water fountain
have fallen on me?
I couldn't find any water, but
the moisture in these fruit-nut-berries
should sustain you.
I climbed perilously high
into the trees to pick them,
yet I saw no sign
of intelligent life.
Bummer.
Moreover, the crash
totally destroyed our ship.
So we're stuck here
until someone finds us?
Alas, that may never happen.
Stealth technology
makes the ship impossible to locate,
yet easy to stub your crotch on.
Well, there's worse places
to be marooned.
Plenty of food, mild climate.
It's a veritable Garden of Eden.
It is?
Did that snake say hello?
No. We're both delirious
from dehydration.
Just like Adam and Eve.
We can still save Earth.
People are sure
to clean up their act
when presented with cold, hard facts
by rational folks like us.
<i>The end is near!
Repent thy sins!</i>
I'll thinks it overs
while I engages
this five-dollar hooker.
Don't do it!
It's not worth it!
Okay, make it three dollars.
I don't wants
no three-dollar hooker.
I'm going backs
to the adults bookstore.
Adult bookstore?
I thought this was the public library.
Pubic library.
Where are you?
God, I'm actually
starting to miss him.
Maybe you two belong together.
We do not.
And you can't talk.
Come on.
It must be an awful temptation.
Guess who just killed a
woodchuck with his bare feet?
I thought I'd whip
us up some shelter.
Make this a little more like home.
I do miss the Earth terribly.
I wonder if it's even still there?
Let's find out together.
I'll brave
the ship's wreckage to
fetch you the telescope.
That's so sweet.
I'm just sayin', is all.
I know my new plan is a long shot,
but it's the only hope left.
Well, now I've heard everything.
On my iPod.
So, do you have a new plan, Professor?
And is there any hope left?
Indeed. We're here on
Earth's last unspoiled acre
to show the Death-Sphere
there's still purity in the world.
Begin transmitting.
Commence purity chant.
I'm proud of you, Bender...
avoiding sin for almost a full minute.
Yeah, baby, you're quite a dish.
Quiet your riot.
What's the worst that could happen?
Earth is gone!
We're the only two humans
left in the universe!
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela.
Maybe this was meant to be.
Maybe you and I were meant
to build a new world here.
We can avoid humanity's mistakes.
Like the tuba.
We'll be like Adam and Eve.
Only without the tuba.
And we'll beget little Zapp Junior.
And Leela Junior.
And they'll have kids of their own.
Yuck! Is that really
what happened in the Bible?
It's a sick and twisted book
of holiness, all right.
Then we'll write our own bible.
With less Sodom and more Gomorrah.
Let's do it.
I shall become
the mother of a new world,
trapped here, under this tree.
The Tree of Knowledge.
Look, it even has apples!
Come here, Adam.
Partake of my forbidden fruit.
Thee will be done.
Wait. One more bite
before we begin the begetting.
Juicy.
Those nut-berries
you found were so salty,
I couldn't think straight.
I mean, not to belabor it,
but they were as salty
as that bag of trail mix
Fry gave me.
Exactly as salty.
Wait a second!
I have a terrible
confession to make.
You see, when I first went foraging,
what I actually found was the smoldering
wreckage of the ship.
Ignoring all danger, I charged
inside to liberate our provisions.
So thisisthe trail mix Fry gave me!
I exaggerated when I said
I picked it from the treetops.
I just wanted you to think...
a little better of me.
Your motives were good.
And we were both loopy
from dehydration.
Wait.
You've been doing
an awful lot of urinating.
There's plenty of water.
You see, after I selflessly
rescued the trail mix,
I braved the flames once more,
in search of fluids.
Why didn't you give me any?
I thought it might help you forget
your intense hatred for me if
you were a teensy bit delirious.
So you let me dehydrate
while you washed down the trail mix
with imported mineral water?
Not exactly.
You see, besides the trail mix,
the minibar also contained
Doritos, beef jerky,
and an assortment
of fine chocolates.
I wanted to offer you
the chocolates.
I truly did... but I was
concerned about your waistline.
Very concerned.
It's because
I haven't been exercising.
If only this tree
hadn't fallen on me by chance.
Oh, dear God!
It was just after we crashed.
I awoke first, to find you trapped.
Wake up.
You could've moved
this grub-infested log
any time you wanted?
Well, sure...
but then I wouldn't have been able
to provide the loving care
you wouldn't have needed.
I'd leave you to rot
in this paradise,
if only the ship weren't destroyed.
The ship's fully functional,
isn't it?
You see, after re-trapping you
and before feigning unconsciousness,
I paused to enjoy a cigar.
Though mellow and satisfying,
it did parch me a bit,
so I went in search of brandy.
That's when my keen senses
detected the still-invisible ship.
So we can go back to Earth?
But there is no Earth anymore!
Everyone I know is dead!
This seems like a good place
to take a dump.
You're alive!
But how did you find this planet?
Well?
We're actually on Earth.
The ship's homing device
brought us back.
But I saw Earth explode.
I'm actually
kind of proud of this one.
You see, what you saw
was merely a simulation I rigged up,
using the ship's holographic
targeting projector.
The alleged "telescope"
was a toilet paper tube.
You said there wasn't
any toilet paper!
And that humanity was annihilated!
My motives were pure.
I just wanted to you to think
we had to save humanity
so you'd be willing to have sex.
Please say you believe me.
Yes, I believe you.
There must be something
to steal on this island.
It's Leela.
Let's go home, everybody.
At least the world wasn't destroyed.
Yet.
<i>People of Earth!</i>
<i>Hear the righteous word
of the mighty V-GINY!</i>
The mighty V-GINY!
<i>Seeing you frolic</i>
<i>in this unspoiled garden</i>
<i>gives hope that this world
may yet be redeemed.</i>
Huzzah!
The purity chant worked!
<i>Unacceptable wardrobe malfunction!</i>
<i>I was referring to Adam and Eve!</i>
We're not Adam and Eve.
You see, due to a series of...
<i>Consummate your union,</i>
<i>or I shall destroy Earth.</i>
If it's to save Earth...
I guess I could take one
for the team.
What? Right now?!
But I need a romance first.
Maybe a vanilla candle or something?
<i>Commence intercourse!</i>
Those giant guns
are making me feel sort of inadequate.
- I'm not sure if I can...
- Move it.
I gotta get home and do laundry.
For God's sake, censor it!
Censor it!
<i>Approved for all audiences!</i>
<i>And now, the spicy finale of...</i>
The transcredible exploits
of Zapp Brannigan
That was a close call,
but we saved Earth.
Was it as good for you
as it was for the human race?
Let's save another planet right now!

Moi, le maire,
je lance sans aucun plaisir
le 83e ou 84e
Festival
de Recyclage Électronique Annuel !
Baisse-toi !
Désolé, les foules m'excitent.
Je vais commencer
en jetant un déchet symbolique,
cette machine à vote
vieille et inutile !
Ces vieux outils d'Apocalypse
sont très instables.
Je préfère
ne pas savoir où ils sont.
Adieu,
toilettes japonaises compliquées.
Pitié, pas jeter moi.
Moi donner vous bons moments.
Tu en sais trop, désolé.
Ça m'a l'air pas mal
pour jeter des preuves.
Flexo ?
Tu fais quoi
dans les déchets toxiques ?
Tu le sais pas ? Les robots tordeurs
sont complètement dépassés.
Surchauffe, radioactivité,

À qui parles-tu ?
Personne. Ta mère. Ta gueule.
Choisis.
Scoop Chang, éditeur du blog

Monsieur, n'est-ce pas dangereux ?
Pas du tout, Scoop.

Bonne nouvelle, les inconnus !
TIERS MONDE
DE LA GALAXIE D'ANTARÈS
Bonjour, mes amis !
On va vous démonter
cette carcasse vite fait.
Pas touche à notre carcasse.
Vraiment ?
Parce qu'on peut récupérer le chrome
pour faire de la mort aux rats
et des édulcorants artificiels.
Non merci.
On apporte des déchets.
Dommage. On avait commencé.
40 % de chrome là-dedans !
Doucement avec la benne.
Début du traitement !
Ça sent les sinus saignants.
Nous brûlons vos déchets
pour récupérer les métaux,
ce qui libère les toxines
dans l'air et l'eau potable.
- J'ai jamais rien vu de pire !
- Alors ne regardez pas ça.
Les enfants !
On joue à "Trouve le brillant" !
C'est encore pire !
Les enfants font tout le travail ?
Pas le fouet.
Nous avons peut-être appris
de bonnes choses sur le recyclage,
mais ce serait mieux
d'utiliser nos appareils
le plus longtemps possible,
au lieu de les jeter
n'importe où.
Je vais donc garder
mon ancien portable,
même s'il est dépassé.
<i>Bonjour, Mlle Turanga.</i>
<i>Appel à Saint-Louis effectué.</i>
Jetons au moins cette télé.
Les piles de la télécommande
sont mortes.
Non ! Remets-la et allume !
C'était pour participer.
<i>Plus de détails
après un mot de notre sponsor.</i>
<i>Avec le nouvel eyePhone,
regardez, écoutez, ignorez vos amis,</i>
<i>harcelez votre ex,
regardez du porno dans le bus,</i>
<i>ou lisez vos mails
pendant un accident de train.</i>
<i>Tout ça avec le nouvel eyePhone.</i>
<i>M'man.</i>
Un nouvel eyePhone ?
Retourne dans la poubelle.
- En voilà un bel au revoir !
- À plus !
- <i>Sayonara !</i>
- Bon débarras !
On va acheter nos eyePhone en ligne.
Je pensais
qu'on allait les acheter en ligne.
On est en ligne.
Je pensais au magasin
à l'autre bout de la ville.
C'est ça.
- Je pensais...
- Arrête de penser !
Je suis un zombie. J'aimerais savoir
depuis quand on attend.
Il y a une application pour ça !
Il y en a une
pour m'embrasser le cul ?
Plein !
La lumière ! On est en enfer ?
C'est celle du magasin.
DÉCOUVREZ LE NOUVEL EYEPHONE
C'est cette chanson underground
qu'on entend partout.
<i>Bonjour, chers clients.
Bienvenue dans le magasin M'man.</i>
<i>Le nouvel eyePhone
est en quantité limitée,</i>
- <i>donc allez sagement former...</i>
- Dégagez !
- Il en reste ?
- Un ou deux.
Ça vaut 500 $,
il y a un seul opérateur,
la batterie dure 10 minutes,
et la réception est pas...
Prenez mon argent !
<i>Le nouvel eyePhone est superbe.</i>
<i>J'y vérifie mes recettes,</i>
<i>et envoie des mails menaçants</i>
<i>aux développeurs libres.</i>
Vous venez d'une de ces minorités
qui s'y connaissent en technologie.
- Pourquoi ça s'appelle "eyePhone" ?
- Laissez-moi l'installer, avant.
Cool.
Et voici l'oreillette.
<i>Mon application favorite
est Twitcher.</i>
<i>Vous pouvez envoyer et recevoir
des textos et vidéos appelés Twit.</i>
<i>D'ailleurs, en voici un.</i>
<i>Coucou, M'man.
Je t'aime plus que...</i>
<i>Batterie faible.</i>
<i>Mais ne me croyez pas sur parole.</i>
<i>Critiques-impartiales.mman dit
que c'est une application mortelle.</i>
Et quand je dis "mortelle",
je le pense !
<i>Et maintenant,
un nouvel épisode téléchargeable</i>
<i>des Vraies Simettes aux foyers.</i>
<i>Elle doit rebooter.
Faut lui dire en face.</i>
On comprend la fin
des médias traditionnels.
Regardez ce webisode
du Crapaud Hypno.
REJOUER ?
Kif ton vieux format, l'ancêtre.
Les jeunes comme moi,
on fait nos propres épisodes.
<i>Ça vient du kidnappeur.
Mon neveu est vivant !</i>
<i>Et il est</i>
<i>dans cette enveloppe.</i>
<i>Ils m'ont enlevé ma 3D !</i>
<i>Voilà Bender ! Il va nous sauver !</i>
Il m'arrive quoi ?
C'est la puberté ?
On t'appelle, débile.
L'eyePhone fait aussi téléphone ?
- Fry-lut.
- <i>Salut, Fry.</i>
<i>Tu savais que l'eyePhone
faisait aussi téléphone ?</i>
Parler en vol, c'est pas dangereux ?
<i>Oui, mais c'est mains libres.</i>
<i>Comme ça, je peux manger
ce taco et ces spaghettis.</i>
Je raccroche.
Regardez cette vidéo d'une idiote
qui défonce son vaisseau !
T'as filmé ?
L'eyePhone filme tout.
J'ai juste ajouté des rires
et l'ai twité à mes 10 000 abonnés.
D'ailleurs,
c'est l'heure de ma Twit-à-jour.
Salut, les gars.
<i>Ici Fry.</i>
<i>Rotant des oeufs,
grattant mes champignons,</i>
<i>et cherchant l'amour.</i>
Des champignons ?
C'est trop d'informations.
Au contraire, c'est parfait !
Avant, je collectais mes données
avec de vieilles méthodes,
comme les robots espions,
ou les infomoustiques.
- Ce mec adore le porno.
- Mais,
grâce à Twitcher,
ces débiles déballent
ce qu'il me faut pour les manipuler !
Cible localisée, M'man.
Lance l'algorithme de marketing !
<i>Souffrez-vous horriblement...</i>
de mes champignons.
<i>Vous, monsieur ou madame</i>
<i>devez acheter
la crème antichampignons de M'man !</i>
Vous pouvez l'ajouter
à ma facture d'eyePhone ?
<i>Bien sûr !</i>
<i>Regarde par ici !</i>
Cet appareil sait toujours
quand j'ai faim !
Écoutez, mes abonnés.
Garniture gratuite à la pizzeria
de l'autre côté de la rue ! Envoi.
C'est pour ça qu'on est là. Envoi.
Salut, mes abonnés.
Cinquième jour de mon voyage
autour du monde en kayak.
Envoi.
T'imagines que 50 000 débiles
vont y croire ?
Envoi.
Attends, t'as 50 000 abonnés ?
J'en ai que trois. Envoi.
Je me suis désabonnée hier.
J'ai plus d'abonnés,
car je leur donne ce qu'ils veulent.
Comme cette vidéo de toi en caleçon,
faisant du karaté.
À l'aide ! Police !
Envoi.
C'est bas, Bender,
- même pour toi.
- Comment ça ?
Depuis quand l'intimité est violée
sur internet ?
6 août 1991.
Je peux avoir plus d'abonnés
sans m'abaisser à ton niveau.
Le premier à un million
gagne un dollar !
J'en suis !
Envoi.
- Et pour le perdant ?
- Rendons ça intéressant.
Pourquoi M. Chunks
vomit dans ce bassin ?
Parce que le perdant
doit plonger dans un bassin
de vomi de chèvre alien.
Compliquons les choses.
Du vomi et de la diarrhée.
Bonne idée.
Pas de gâchis, au moins.
C'est dégueu.
Vous lui donnez quoi à manger ?
Ce qui sort par un trou,
rentre par l'autre.
Et de la bouffe indienne.
Que le défi commence !
LECON DE POLITIQUE 56
LES TARIFS
Incroyable.
Presque un million d'abrutis
suivent les twits
d'un autre abruti !
Vous m'écoutez,
bande d'abrutis ?
Pourquoi êtes-vous en colère,
M'man ?
Désolée.
Ce plan diabolique me rend nerveuse.
Bande d'abrutis !
On entre dans la phase 2 du plan.
Quand quelqu'un
aura un million d'abonnés,
je propagerai grâce à lui...
le ver-twit.
Quelle sorcière.
Parlez-nous de ce ver-twit.
C'est un virus spécial,
qui n'affecte pas les ordinateurs,
mais le cerveau humain.
J'adore.
Tous les abonnés
deviendront des zombies,
obéissant à mes ordres.
On est une famille,
et c'est ça l'important.
Non !
Il a éternué dedans.
Mince, je vais perdre le pari.
Je vais devoir me baigner
dans du vomi-pipi.
N'abandonne pas.
Il te faut des twits intéressants.
Et c'est ce que je veux.
Alors abaisse-toi
au niveau de Bender.
Arrête de faire
ta reine d'Angleterre.
C'était qui, la reine d'Angleterre ?
Pardon.
Je dois... ailleurs.
Bizarre. D'où ça venait ?
Pas de la chèvre.
Tous ses orifices sont occupés.
- C'est quoi, ça ?
- Rien.
Je ne suis pas rien.
Tout ma vie, on m'a traité de rien.
Tu as un furoncle sur tes fesses
qui chante de la variété ?
Va-t'en. Je suis un monstre.
Non... en fait...
J'ai honte de Susan depuis toujours.
Ton furoncle s'appelle Susan ?
J'ai pas le droit ?
Et on dit qu'un furoncle
ne peut pas chanter, mais...
Une Écossaise.
Je la perce tous les mois,
mais elle revient toujours.
C'est déjà assez dur
d'être un cyclope,
mais si quelqu'un sait pour Susan,
je suis fichue.
Dégueu !
Et valant un million d'abonnés.
Supprime.
- Supprime ça maintenant !
- Quoi ?
Pour un bon bain de vomi.
Envoi.
Tu l'as supprimée ?
Tu es un bon ami.
Voilà la vraie.
Prêt à huer ?
Voilà le plus gros buzz d'Internet !
Où ça ?
Et... quoi ?
Remets-la encore une fois.
C'est humiliant et dégradant
pour Leela.
Remets-la dix fois de plus.
J'aurais pas dû le twiter,
mais gagner ce pari
calmera ma conscience.
Mais si Leela le découvre,
sa dignité s'effondrera.
Elle ne doit pas voir ça.
Leela, ferme la porte
pour que Leela ne...
Comment t'as pu faire ça ?
Pauvre M. Chunks.
Au moins, il est mort
en faisant ce qu'il aimait.
Il est parti pour un monde meilleur.
J'ai transformé une planche normale
en plongeoir.
Réponse imminente !
Nous allons connaître
le gagnant du pari.
Super !
J'espère que c'est moi.
Une minute.
Je pourrais perdre ?
Ça faisait pas partie du plan.
Nom de Georgia Brown
de Kingston Town.
Match nul.
Personne n'a perdu,
donc personne ne doit sauter.
Match nul ! Je gagne encore.
Je suis un vrai salaud.
Te tracasse pas.
Au moins, t'es pas Leela.
Match nul ?
C'est mieux que je ne l'avais rêvé.
J'aurai 2 millions de zombies.
Fry et Bender peuvent avoir
les mêmes abonnés.
Ce qui est sûr,
c'est qu'il y aura
entre 1 et 2 millions de zombies.
Ce qui est sûr, c'est...
Arrête de te faire baffer,
et branche le ver-twit.
C'est à la fois
dégoûtant et inspirant,
comme Jared de <i>Subway.</i>
J'ai un bouton au cul qui chante,
mais je suis encore
plus ou moins un être humain.
Bouton chantant ?
C'est dépassé.
Comme cette chenille géante
qui a mangé Jared de <i>Subway.</i>
Nous, geeks de l'Internet,
on a un nouveau buzz.
Mon humiliation est terminée ?
T'es qui ?
Maintenant,
créons une armée invincible
d'entre 1 et 2 millions de zombies.
Ce serait pas mieux
d'attendre une meilleure météo ?
Voici le ver-twit.
Envoi.
Ma tête fait n'importe quoi.
- Je suis venue te parler.
- Non, je suis venu te parler.
T'étais juste assis là,
mais c'est pas grave.
Je suis désolé de ce que j'ai fait,
je pourrai jamais me rattraper.
Pas besoin d'excuses.
En fait, je suis venue te remercier.
Tu veux dire me frapper.
Tout le monde connaît mon secret,
mais ils s'en foutent.
Je n'ai plus rien à cacher.
Avec ton égoïsme,
tu m'as soulagée d'un énorme poids.
C'est pas le seul endroit
où t'as besoin de perdre un poids.
Susan et moi sommes d'accord.
Pour la première fois,
nous n'avons pas
honte de nous-mêmes.
Je n'ai jamais eu honte.
Viens par là.
Qu'est-ce qui pue ?
T'es allé au New Jersey ?
Je savais
que je pouvais pas me rattraper,
donc j'ai fait de mon mieux.
J'ai subi la même humiliation
que je t'ai faite subir.
Fallait pas faire ça.
Non ? Merde.
T'inquiète pas.
Demain, ce sera oublié.
Un autre câlin ?
Bouche-toi le nez et vas-y.

As mayor,
it is my deeply tedious pleasure
to kick off
the 83rd or 84th
Annual E-Waste Recycling Festival!
Down in front!
Sorry. I get aroused in crowds.
I will now throw out
the ceremonial first dump,
this old, inefficient vote rigger!
These old doomsday devices
are dangerously unstable.
I'll rest easier not knowing
where they are.
So long,
overly complicated Japanese toilet.
Please not to throw away.
I give you a happy poopie time.
Sorry, you know too much.
Seems like a good place
to ditch some evidence.
Flexo?
What are you doing
in a hazardous waste bin?
Haven't you heard? Us bending units
are dangerously outdated.
We overheat, we're radioactive,
we cause erectile dysfunc...
Who are you talking to?
No one. Your mama. Shut up.
Take your pick.
Scoop Chang, New New York Times
online podcast blog comments editor.
Mr. Mayor,
isn't this e-waste dangerous?
Not at all, Scoop.
Not after it's hauled
off to the Third World
by an expendable team
of minimum-wage nobodies.
Good news, nobodies!
Greetings, my friends!
It shan't take long
to strip down your clunker.
Nothing wrong with our clunker.
Really? Because we can smelt out
the deadly, deadly chromium
to make rat poison
and artificial sweeteners.
No, thanks.
We're delivering e-waste.
Pity. We're halfway done.
This thing is 40% chromium!
Gentle now.
Gentle with the hoverdumpster.
Ready for processing!
What smells like bloody sinuses?
We burn your e-waste down
to the usable metals,
safely releasing the toxins
into our air and drinking water.
- That's the worst thing I've ever seen!
- Really? Then don't look over there.
Okay, kids.
Let's play find the shiny!
That's even more horrific!
Is all the work done by children?
Not the whipping.
Granted, we later learned
some positive things about recycling,
but a better solution
is to use our electronics
as long as possible
instead of throwing them out
in the first place.
I'm gonna start by keeping
my old cell phone,
even if it is outdated.
<i>Hello, Miss Turanga.</i>
<i>Your call to Saint Louis
has gone through.</i>
Let's at least throw this TV out.
The batteries in the remote
are getting low.
No! Put that back and turn it on!
I was just trying to help.
<i>More on this breaking puff-piece
after a word from our sponsor.</i>
<i>With the new eyePhone, you can watch,
listen, ignore your friends,</i>
<i>stalk your ex,
download porno on a crowded bus,</i>
<i>even check your e-mail
while getting hit by a train.</i>
<i>All with the new eyePhone.</i>
<i>From Mom.</i>
A new eyePhone?
Forget this junk.
- This is a fine how-do-you-do!
- So long!
- <i>Sayonara!</i>
- Good riddance!
Come on,
let's buy some eyePhones online.
Wait. I thought we were buying
our eyePhones online.
We are on line.
But I thought the Mom Store
was across town.
It is across town.
- But I thought...
- Stop thinking, Fry!
I feel like a mindless zombie. I wish
I knew how long we've been waiting.
The eyePhone has an app for that!
Is there an app
for kissing my shiny metal ass?
Several!
The light!
I guess I'm off to hell.
That's the store, Professor.
It's that obscure underground song
that's constantly playing everywhere.
<i>Hello, dearies.
Welcome to the Mom Store.</i>
<i>The new eyePhones
are in short supply,</i>
- <i>so please form an orderly...</i>
- Out of the way!
- Are there any left?
- There may be one.
Okay, it's $500,
you have no choice of carrier,

Say, you're from one of those
ethnicities that knows about technology.
- Why is it called an eyePhone?
- I'll explain after I install it.
Neat.
Now for the ear piece.
<i>But my favorite app
is called Twitcher.</i>
<i>Twitcher lets you send and receive
short messages or videos called twits.</i>
<i>Why, here's a twit now.</i>
<i>Hi, Mom.
I love you more than can...</i>
<i>Low battery.</i>
<i>But don't takey word for it.</i>
<i>Unbiased-Reviews-dot-Mom
says Twitcher is the killer app.</i>
<i>And when I say killer app,</i>
<i>I mean killer app!</i>
<i>And now another downloadisode</i>

Nowadays, cool kids like me

<i>And he's...</i>

<i>They cut off one of my dimensions!</i>
<i>My God, it's Bender!

What's happening to me?
Is it puberty?
It's a phone call, dingus.
These eyePhones are phones, too?
- Fry-lo.
- <i>Hi, Fry.</i>
<i>Did you know these eyePhones
are phones, too?</i>
Is it safe to talk
while you're flying?
<i>Totally.
This thing's hands-free.</i>
<i>That's how I can eat this taco.
And this spaghetti.</i>
I'm hanging up now.
Check out this Internet video
of some idiot crashing her spaceship!
You recorded?
The eyePhone records everything.
All I did was add a laugh track
and twit it to my 10,000 followers.
That reminds me.
It's time to my hourly twupdate.
'Sup, followers.
<i>Fry here.</i>
<i>Burping eggs,
scratching my underarm fungus,</i>
<i>looking for love.</i>
Underarm fungus?
Too much information.
It's exactly the right amount
of information!
For years, I've collected personal data
with old-fashioned methods,
like spybots and info-squitos.
- This guy sure loves porno.
- But now,
thanks to Twitcher,
morons voluntarily spew out
every fact I need to exploit them!
Target acquired, Mother.
Fire direct marketing algorithm!
Do you suffer from
the heartbreak of...
My underarm fungus.
Then you, Mr. or Mrs...
<i>... need the soothing relief
of Mom's Caustic Anti-Fungal Bleach!</i>
Can I somehow charge it to my eyePhone
for an additional fee?
<i>Hell, yes!</i>
<i>Hey, fatso, stuffa you face!</i>
This thing always seems to know
when I got the munchies!

Wait.

I only have three. Send.
I unsubscribed yesterday.
I got the most followers 'cause
I give the people what they want.
Like this video of you doing karate
in your underpants.
Help! Police!
Send.
That is low, Bender,
- even by your standards.
- My what now?
Since when is the Internet
about robbing people of their privacy?
August 6, 1991.
I'll bet I can get as many followers
as you without sinking to your level.
What do you say? First one
to a million followers wins a buck.
You're on!
Send.
- What happens to the loser?
- Let's make it interesting.
Why is Mr. Chunks doing that?
Because the loser of our bet
has to do a double somersault
into a tub of alien goat vomit.
Let's make it interestinger.
Vomit and diarrhea.
Good idea.
That way we don't waste an end.
It's putrid.
What do you feed him?
What comes out one end,
we feed to the other.
Also Indian food.
Let the contest begin!
Amazing.
Some dumb bastard has nearly
a million other dumb bastards
following his every twit!
Are you dumb bastards
listening to me,
you dumb bastards?
Why are you so angry, mommy?
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just a little nervous
about my evil plan.
You dumb bastards!
You see, the plan is about
to enter phase two.
As soon as someone
reaches a million followers,
I'll use them to transmit...
The twit-worm.
Mother, you devious hag.
Tell us more about this "twit-worm."
It's a very special computer virus,
for instead of infecting computers,
it infects the human brain.
I like it.
The million followers
will become an army of zombies,
eager to obey my every command.
The important thing is,
we're a family.
It's not!
He sneezed in it.
God, I'm going to lose the bet.
I'm gonna have to swim in the juice
of the puke-me-poop-you.
Don't give up.
You just need more titillating twits.
Trust me, I want twits that tittle.
Then you're gonna have
to sink to Bender's level.
Stop acting like the
Queen of England.
Who was that...
the Queen of England?
Excuse me.
I have to... someplace.
That was odd.
Where'd that singing come from?
It wasn't the goat.
All of its orifices are in use.
- What the hell is that?
- Nothing.
I'm not nothing.
All my life everyone's
called me nothing.
You have a boil on your butt
that sings show tunes with you?
Don't look at me. I'm a freak.
No, no... well...
I've been ashamed of Susan
as long as I can remember.
You named your boil Susan?
A boil kinna have a name?
They also said a boil
kinna sing, but...
She's Scottish.
I lance her every few months,
but she always grows back.
It's hard enough being a cyclops,
but if anyone found out about Susan,
I'd be devastated.
Gross. Million-follower gross.
Delete that.
- Delete that right now!
- What?
So much for a pleasant swim
in vomit.
Send.
Did you delete it?
You're a good friend.
There she goes in the genuine.
Let's get to hooting.
If it ain'ts the world's number ones
Internet sensation!
Where?
Also... what?
Play it one more time.
It's humiliating
and degrading to Leela.
Play it ten more times.
I shouldn't have twitted that,
but not swimming in barf
might ease my conscience.
But if Leela should find out,
her dignity sac will rupture.
We can't let her see this.
Leela, lock the door
so Leela doesn't...
How could you do this?
Poor Mr. Chunks.
At least he died doing
what he loved.
He's in a better place now.
I turned a regular board
into a diving board.
Impending news, everyone.
We're about to learn
the winner of the bet.
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
I hope it's me.
Wait a minute.
There's a chance I could lose?
That wasn't part of the deal.
Sweet Georgia Brown
of Kingston Town.
It's a tie.
Since no one lost,
no one has to jump.
All right, a tie! I win again!
I'm a scuzzball.
Don't feel bad.
At least you're not Leela.
A tie?
This worked out better
than I could have hoped.
Now I'll have two million zombies.
Actually, Fry and Bender
may share the same followers.
All we can say for sure
is that there will be
between one million
and two million zombies.
All I can say for sure is...
Now, stop getting slapped
and power up the twit-worm.
It's both disgusting and inspiring,
like Jared from subway.
I'm a freak
with a singing butt boil,
but I'm still a human being,
more or less.
Singing butts boil?
That's yesterdayses news.
Like that giant caterpillar
what ate Jared from subway.
Nows us Internet geeks
gots a whole new video sensation.
So my humiliation is over?
Who are you?
And now,
to create an unstoppable army
of between one
and two million zombies.
Shouldn't you wait
for the weather to clear up?
I give you the twit-worm.
Send.
I'm sick of my head doing things.
- I came to talk to you.
- No, I came to talk to you.
It looked like you
were just sitting there, but whatever.
I am so, so sorry for what I did,
and I can never make it up to you...
You don't have to apologize.
In fact, I came to thank you.
I think you mean hit me.
Everyone knows my secret,
but noone cares.
I have nothing to hide anymore.
Thanks to your selfish rudeness,
a terrible weight
has been lifted from my heart.
That's not the only place you
need a terrible weight lifted.
Susan and I are agreed.
For the first time in our lives,
we're not ashamed of who we are.
I was never ashamed.
Come here.
What stinks?
Were you rolling around
in New Jersey?
I knew I could never
make it up to you,
so I did the next best thing...
I put myself
through the same humiliation
I put you through.
- You didn't have to do that.
- I didn't?
- Damn.
- Don't worry.
By tomorrow, no one will remember.
Can I have another hug?
Hold your nose and give it a go.

Merci.
Je suis de retour sur le marché.
Le marché des vieilles filles.
- Excusez-moi, ce sont les vôtres ?
- Ouais.
Et ça aussi.
Je sais que c'est dur.
Vous allez divorcer ?
On était des Fon-Fon-Rus,
donc pas vraiment mariés.
Le plus intéressant, c'est...

Pourquoi il t'a jeté

Il pense que j'aime les <i>bad boys</i>.
C'est stupide.

Tu sais ce qui est arrivé

Quoi ?
C'était cool.

Et ce loser dégueu et puant ?
- Que fais-tu ici ?
- Je viens sauver Amy...
de son désir robosexuel.
En gros, j'ai compris mon erreur ?
- Étranges, ces clins d'oeil.
- C'est l'amour !
Mes parents ont le mérite
d'être stupides.
Vous allez maintenant
combattre vos démons.
Des démons bien gaulés
et bien en chair.
Regarde-moi ces seins !
Enfin... je veux être un saint !
Bien !
C'est très bien.
Changez de démon.
La monogamie, ça craint.
C'est bien, allez-y.

Amen.

Bonsoir,

Votre hôte pour ce débat.
Applaudissez.
On a joué à pile ou face,
mais Bender a volé la pièce.
Il commence, donc.
Mesdames et messieurs les jurés.
Désolé, l'habitude.
Je soutiens cette loi,
car j'aime une superbe humaine.
Sans surprise, c'est réciproque.
C'est une question de justice.
D'habitude, je lutte contre elle.
Alors, votez oui.
Notre amour ne diffère pas du vôtre.
Sauf pour le sexe,
car je me la donne.
C'est le meilleur discours
que j'ai entendu
depuis Bill Shatner m'expliquant
pourquoi il ne pouvait me rembourser.
Professeur, un avis ?
Ce tas de ferraille parle d'amour,
mais ce qu'il décrit,
c'est de la perversion !
Tu la verrais pas,
même pendue à tes couilles.
T'es jaloux
de pas connaître l'amour.
Quand j'étais rempli d'urine
et de vinaigre,
contrairement à mon lit,
je connus l'amour.
Avec la plus belle fille
à emmener dans un champ de fleurs.
<i>Elle s'appelait Eunice.</i>
<i>On passait nos journées au labo,</i>
<i>à développer un poison
pour stopper l'invasion des fleurs.</i>
<i>Je pensais notre amour éternel.</i>
<i>Mais, elle me quitta,
43 ans plus tard.</i>
<i>Pour un robot !</i>
Comment a-t-elle pu faire ça
à sa Farnscrotte ?
C'est tout ?
Tu hais les robosexuels
car on t'a quitté pour un robot ?
Elle m'a pas seulement quitté
pour un robot,
c'était un robot !
Elle ne s'appelait pas Eunice.
Mais Unité !
Unité 47 !
<i>J'ai eu le coeur brisé.</i>
Puis, comme un vieux ronchon,
je m'en suis pris
à tous les robosexuels.
J'ai tellement honte !
Au risque de perdre le débat,
je vous demande
de soutenir la loi Infini !
Fais-moi un câlin !
Je les câline mentalement.
Et ils me le rendent bien.
Mon Dieu !
<i>Étonnamment,</i>
<i>la loi Infini est passée.</i>
<i>Le mariage robosexuel est légal.</i>
<i>Ce sera quoi ensuite,
le mariage robosexuel gay ?</i>
On a réussi, chéri !
Le mariage monogame nous attend !

this is mine, too.
Tough break, Amy.
Are you and Kif getting divorced?
No, technically we were Fon-Fon-Rus,
so we weren't really married.
The interesting thing
about that is...
So, Amy, how can I phrase
this delicately?
Why did Kif dump you
like a sack of yesterday's turds?
He says I have a thing for bad boys.
It's so stupid.
The truth is often stupid.
Bender, why do you have
to be so mean to me?
Shut up, baby, you love it.
Don't tell me to shut up.
You know what happened
to the last guy who told me to shut up?
What?
That was great.
Shut up.
Yeah, come over here.
Remember, love between a human

only affected children.
Children of all ages.
Bender, old friend,
what's on your face?
Blood.
You know...
shaving of the face beard.
Amy, are those gear imprints
on your sweatpants?
Maybe. So what?
I only brought it up
'cause Bender's wearing them.
I stole 'em from her.
Yeah, that's it, call the cops.
My swollen feet.
I'd better take my pills.
Amy, I reckon sweet talk
don't come natural to me,
but of everyone I've ever dated,
you are probably in the top ten.
You always say just the wrong thing
in just the right way.
Sinners!
Robosexuality is an abomination!
- This guy.
- The good book say
a robot shall not lie down
with a human,
nor do it standing up,
nor at any angle in between.
Look, a single mother!
Let's get her!
Quickly, into the ship's basement!
Now then, as you all know,
the county fair
is approaching once again,
so I'm preparing my entry
of pickled winds and weathers.
I've got sunny, snow flurries,
hail with onions,
even my grandmother's
cranberry-raisin typhoon,
but no tornado.
I'll be damned if I let Mrs. Girdleson
take the blue ribbon again.
That's why I need you
to get out there
and harvest a nice ripe one.
This cattle prod should help.
- How will that...?
- Get out there!
Is everybody in position?!
What?!
Is someone talking?!
Okay, good! On three!
One!
What did she say?!
- Two!
- Wait, I'm not in position!
- Three!
- I'm ready for the countdown!
I'm not hearing anyone!
Abort mission!
She said go!
Good work, everyone.
Honestly, that went
better than I expected.
I just need to reduce it
down into this pickle jar,
toss in a bay leaf
to impress those stupid judges...
Where's Amy and Bender?
They're missing out
on some hot pickle action.
Sounds like a muskrat's
caught in there.
That's Amy's sweatshirt.
And that's Bender's hat
from the Playah's Ball!
Sweet tornado of Barbado.
Amy and Bender
have been torn to shreds.
The humanity.
Also Bender.
What's going on here?!
Nothing.
A pair of deviant robosexuals?!
Not under my roof.
What about on the roof?
- Get your mind out of the gutter.
- What about in the gutter?
Professor, there's nothing wrong
with robosexuality.
Yeah, when the lights go out,
it's nobody's business
what goes on
between two consenting adults.
Or one.
Thanks, guys.
Everything will be okay as long
as my parents don't find out.
<i>Zai jian.</i>
Mom? Dad?
Come home, Amy. It your decision.
We can't make you.
Attagirl.
Not the innocent whistling.
Repent!
Oh, this guy.
Look, we're your family,
and if you can't talk about your problem
with us, that would be great.
I don't have a problem!
I'm in a happy relationship
that just happens to be robosex...
You finish that word,
you kill your parents!
<i>Low wine level detected.</i>
- Thank you.
- Stop seducing him, you hussy!
Dad, gleesh!
I'm attracted to Bender,
not this emotionless wine bucket!
Hopes...
deleted.
Robotic brothers,
the path to robot hell
- is paved with human flesh!
- Neat!
Over the course
of this escape-proof workshop
your software will be reprogrammed
through prayer.
And by some tech-support guys
in India.
But I read in <i>Esquire</i> magazine
that some robots are hard-wired
to be robosexual.
Don't believe those lies, son!
The only lies worth believing
are the ones in the Bible.
Can I get an amen?
I'll take-a three men. Holla!
Come on, Amy.
Pick a male human already.
I want to be a grandmother...
nine months from five minutes from now.
Cut it out, mom!
I'm not interested in any
of these gross, ugly losers!
What about this gross,
ugly, smelly loser?
- Fry! What you doing here?
- I'm here to rescue Amy...
from her robosexual desire.
If I understand you correctly,
I've seen the error of my ways?
- Look at all that awkward winking?
- It must be love!
My parents may be evil,
but at least they're stupid.
In this phase,
you will literally wrestle
with your demons.
Your shapely, buxom, human demons.
Look at the rack on that one!
I mean... That one on the rack!
Good!
That's very good.
Everybody switch demons.
No point in staying with just one demon.
Now, work it hard!
Harder!
Till the sin explodes outcha!
Mercy.
The Lord's work is done.
Now, now, cuddle,
cuddle with your demons.
I wonder where you are right now.
I'm inside the dummy to rescue you!
That answers that.
Wait, what? Amy?
Bender, be careful!
Fry? Leela? You're in there, too?
I guess we should have waited
in the ship.
Aw, phooey!
Listen up, everybody,
I love Amy, and I'm tired
of pussyfootcupping around.
I finally found someone I want
to spend the rest of her life with.
Will you marry me?
I'm just glad I didn't live
to see this day.
Wait a second.
So, it's a stone.
Is it real?
Hooray!
Hooray denied!
Need I remind you
that robosexual marriage is illegal?
- Not in Space Massachusetts.
- You mean Space-Tax-Achusetts?
No chance, stretch pants!
We're gonna fight to legalize it
right here!
Yah, mon! You got to legalize it!
We're talking about
robosexual marriage.
We're talking of lots stuff.
Cool. Can you turn into a race car?
Nah, I'm just a pre-op transformer.
Thanks for coming, everyone.
We're all having some good,
clean fun here.
Squeaky, squishy clean.
But it's time to discuss
a pressing issue...
the right to marry who
or what we want!
Every other couple
has the right to marry.
Robot and fembot,
man and woman,
man and man.
Our poodle has two daddies!
Interracial,
interplanetary,
even ghost and horse,
but not robot and human!
That's why we're introducing
this ballot initiative to legalize
robosexual marriage!
If you hate intolerance
and being punched in the face by me,
please support Proposition Infinity!
As election day nears,
Prop Infinity appears doomed
to certain defeat.
Doomed!
More fair and balanced coverage
after a word from our sponsor,
no on Infinity.
<i>A storm is gathering.</i>
<i>A storm of robosexual marriage</i>
<i>that will rain down on us like fire.</i>
<i>It's probably a firestorm.</i>
<i>If robosexual marriage
becomes legal,</i>
<i>imagine the horrible things
that will happen to our children,</i>
<i>then imagine we said those things,
since we couldn't think of any.</i>
<i>As a mother, those things worry me.</i>
<i>Vote no on Infinity.
Paid for by the Farnsworth Foundation.</i>
We can't compete against
that much stock footage of clouds!
We're boned!
But we still have one hope...
my big televised debate!
I'm our A in the hole!
Professor,
who's debating for your side?
That guy...
You know, I forget his name.
That's him!
Good evening.
I'm George Takei's head and neck,
your host for tonight's debate.
You may applaud.
We flipped a coin before the debate,
and Bender stole it,
so we'll start with him.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
Sorry, force of habit.
I support this proposition
because I love a goopy,
flesh-and-blood woman,
and, not surprisingly, she loves me.
This is a simple matter of justice,
which I'm not normally for.
So please, vote yes.
After all, our love
isn't any different from yours...
except it's hotter,
'cause I'm involved.
I haven't heard such
an eloquent speech
since Bill Shatner explained
why he couldn't pay me back.
Rebuttal, Professor?
This four-dollar coffeepot
talks about love,
but what he describes is perversion!
You wouldn't know perversion
if it put clamps on your testicles!
You're just jealous,
'cause you've never known true love.
Oh, no? Back when
I was full of piss and vinegar,
and my bed wasn't, I feel in love
with the sweetest girl ever
to skip through a field of posie.
<i>Her name was Eunice,</i>
<i>and we spent out blissful days
working in a lab,</i>
<i>developing a poison</i>
<i>to wipe out
that dreadful posie infestation.</i>
<i>I thought our love
would last forever.</i>
<i>But then, 43 years later,</i>
<i>she left me...</i>
<i>for a robot!</i>
How could she do that to me,
her Farnypoo!
That's it?
You hate robosexuals 'cause
your girlfriend left you for a robot?
She didn't just leave me
for a robot,
she was a robot!
Her name wasn't Eunice,
it was Unit!
Unit 47!
<i>My heart was broken,</i>
and like a bitter old picklepuss,
I took it out
on robosexuals everywhere.
I'm so ashamed!
At the risk of losing this debate,
I beg you,
support Proposition Infinity!
Give me a hug!
I, too, am hugging them in spirit.
And now they're hugging me back.
In a stunning turnabout,
<i>voters have approved
Proposition Infinity.</i>
<i>Robosexual marriage is now legal.</i>
<i>What's next,</i>
<i>gay robosexual marriage?</i>
We did it, honey!
Finally, we can have a legal,
monogamous marriage,
like everyone else!
Monogamous?
<i>And now, a long-distance dedication</i>
<i>from a squishy green bad boy
to his pink pork dumpling...</i>
<i>at number 12,</i>
<i>It's Wailing Fungus with...</i>
<i>"Shut up and love me."</i>

Bienvenue à...
Qui Osera Gagner Des Millions ?
Tremblez
devant l'amabilité de Morbo,
pendant que je converse
avec notre candidat, Philip J. Fry.
APPLAUDISSEZ
OU MOURREZ
Le ménage pas, Morbo !
Préparez-vous à palabrer !
Que faites-vous dans la vie ?
Moi ?
- Je peux appeler un ami ?
- Fin du blabla !
Prêt à jouer ?
Je suis là pour gagner,
pas pour jouer.
Jouons.
Pour un dollar...
Avec quoi martèle-t-on un clou ?
Est-ce A : un marteau,
B : un clou...
B, et c'est mon dernier mot !
Nom d'un dodo du Lesotho !
Tu réfléchis avant de parler ?
J'arrête pas d'y réfléchir.
Laissez-le tranquille.
Son intellect est juste un peu...
différent.
T'es un abruti !
J'ai l'impression
que vous me croyez tous bête.
Tu te souviens à peine de ton nom,
Einstein.
Einstein est difficile à mémoriser.
N'en faites pas une syncope.
Fry est votre ancêtre lointain.
Pas assez lointain.
Si je suis le neveu d'un singe,
alors je suis un singe.
Vous êtes ma seule famille.
Qui récompensera mes réussites ?
J'ai peut-être été un peu rude.
Prends ma main, je vais t'expliquer
pourquoi je te trouve si répugnant.
J'ai toujours été inspiré
par de grands esprits...
tels qu'Euclide, Copernic, Cervo...
Et mon modèle,
Léonard de Vinci.
Ils sont pétrifiés ?
De Vinci était le meilleur inventeur
de tous les temps.
Voilà !
Il a inventé des aéroplanes,
des machines de guerre,
des sous-marins...
- Nibbler est mort.
- Ce n'est pas lui.
C'est mon bien le plus précieux.
La barbe de Léonard !
Elle m'a coûté une fortune
à une enchère de membres historiques.
Je pense que le talon d'Achille
vient de la même enchère.
En effet.
C'est évident.
Attention, pauvre fou !
Ou peut-être oui.
C'est quoi ?
C'est l'invention oubliée
de de Vinci.
Même les écrits des savants
le concernant
ne purent identifier son utilité.
Et enfin, moi non plus !
- On peut peut-être le deviner.
- On ?
Je suis peut-être pas très malin,
mais je connais la ville.
Deux semaines d'hôpital.
- Personne n'est venu.
- Tais-toi !
J'essaie de deviner
à quoi sert l'invention de de Vinci.
Même pas une carte.
Il y a peut-être un indice
dans ses autres travaux.
Bender est parti chercher
une copie de <i>La Cène</i>.
Me revoilà !
Tous des abrutis chez Kinko,
donc j'ai pris l'original.
Jésus Christ...
et ses douze Apôtres.
Bizarre.
Cette main
n'est rattachée à personne.
Et elle pointe un couteau
vers Jacques le Mineur.
C'est ça qui est bien.
Vous avez vu ces pieds de table ?
Sûrement dessinées
par un autre peintre plus funky.
De Vinci a peut-être recouvert
une autre toile.
Ça s'appelle un pentimento.
C'est vrai, Dr Zoidberg.
Comment le savez-vous ?
Je suis docteur
en histoire de l'art.
Voyons ce qu'il y a là-dessous.
Attendez !
J'ai pas une ossature lourde.
Je suis gros.
Mon Dieu ! Regardez !
Mon Dieu ! Je regarde !
Mon Dieu !
Saint Jacques était un robot !
Mon Dieu ! Il n'a pas peint ses jambes
pour laisser un indice.
Mon Dieu !
Le plus grand mystère
de tous les temps.
Prenons l'avion pour Rome
pour y exhumer saint Jacques.
- On est pas une société de livraison ?
- Au vaisseau !
Tu veux rejoindre
mon club très spécial ?
Pourquoi pas.
Plus tard !
J'ai trouvé l'indice
permettant d'accéder à tous les secrets.
- Regardez ces chiffres romains.
- Chiffres romains ?
- J'ai trouvé, on est à Rome !
- Ne sois pas bête.
C'est un code mathématique
oublié depuis longtemps.
Je dois consulter ce manuscrit.
De stupides balivernes...
sur la séquence de Fibonacci...
L'inscription indique
le nombre de pas qu'on doit faire.
Un...
Nous y sommes.
Frères et soeurs, ouvrons.
C'est vrai !
Saint Jacques était un robot.
Je parie
qu'il est au paradis des robots.
Il a pas besoin de ses yeux.
Mon Dieu !
Le robot saint Jacques est un zombie.
Que nenni,
je ne suis point saint Jacques.
Arrête de mentir, saint Jacques.
On t'a vu dans <i>La Cène</i>.
Le grand Léonard m'a construit
en tant que modèle.
En prenant place dans ce cercueil,
j'ai disposé de saint Jacques
avec soin
par ce tas.
Vos questions doivent affluer.
Venez dans la salle
où je discutais
avec le pape Jean le Patient.
Je lui ai dit
que je reviendrai dans cinq minutes.
Il fera un beau petit tas.
Je suis Animatronio,
le gardien du grand secret
de de Vinci.
Il a laissé mes jambes
pour donner un indice
et m'a envoyé ici
pour attendre les intellectuels
de sa société de l'ombre.
Salut, Animatronio.
Tu as connu de Vinci en personne ?
Il était gentil ?
Que sentaient ses cheveux ?
Et d'ailleurs,
à quoi sert cet appareil ?
Assez ! Vous ignorez la fonction
de la <i>Machina Magnifica</i> ?
Alors, vous ne faites point partie
de la société de l'ombre !
- Quoi ?
- Je ne piperai plus un mot.
Pas même sur la grande fontaine
où vous pourriez trouver...
Attendez...
Cette fontaine vous était inconnue,
n'est-il pas ?
Malédiction !
Il faut me punir.
Nous devons découvrir ce qu'il sait,
avant qu'il ne se flagelle à mort.
- Où est la fontaine ?
- En quoi elle est grande ?
Pourquoi t'as une coquille ?
Arrière, bande de mécréants !
Vous ne tirerez aucune information
de ces lèvres mécaniques !
Dis-nous tout.
D'accord,
la fontaine que vous cherchez est...
Notre seul espoir
de résoudre ce mystère s'est envolé.
Venez.
On rentre à la maison.
Attendez !
N'abandonnons pas si facilement.
Animatronio a parlé d'une fontaine.
Et voici une statue de Neptune,
le Dieu de l'eau.
Son trident a trois flèches,
<i>tre</i> en italien.
Le "U" de son nom
a une forme de "V".
Tre... V...
Tre...
Trevi !
La fontaine de Trevi !
C'est sûr et certain !
- Mais professeur...
- Sûr et certain !
Elle n'a pas changé en mille ans.
Allez, tout le monde,
dans la fontaine.
T'es sénile ?
Je vais pas là-dedans.
Il y a des pièces.
J'ai 48 centimes.
Une autre pièce de cinq centimes,
et une grosse !
Vite, dans la bouche d'égouts.
Pourquoi ?
C'est quoi, ce trou ?
Mon Dieu !
C'est le Panthéon !
Cet endroit a 3 000 ans.
Il reste quoi à découvrir ?
Peut-être une part
de notre intimité.
Qu'y a-t-il sous ce drap ?
L'homme de Vitruve de de Vinci !
Un vrai chef d'oeuvre.
Regardez, la perspective attire l'oeil
vers sa bête.
C'est quoi ?
Vous avez entendu ?
Une fente.
Introduis cette pièce géante.
OK.
Chut !
À quoi tu joues, homme de Vitruve ?
Oublie la question,
homme de Vitruve.
L'atelier perdu de de Vinci.
Au risque d'avoir l'air bête,
ces trucs fonctionnent ?
Bien sûr que non, débile !
Cette machine volante
est aussi aérodynamique qu'un sofa !
Comment pourrait-elle décoller ?
Vous ne le découvrirez jamais !
Salut, Animatronio.
J'ai feint la mort et vous ai suivis
pour préserver le plus grand secret
de Léonard.
Allez, mon pote,
on veut des secrets.
Et ils ont intérêt à être vieux.
<i>Porco metallico !</i>
Je ne révèlerai jamais
comment ces machines s'assemblent.
Elles s'assemblent ?
Je n'ai rien dit !
Et je me meurs.
Vous avez raison,
cette chose ne vole pas.
Sors de là, idiot.
C'est dangereux !
Pas étonnant
que ce ne soit pas aérodynamique !
Ce n'est pas un avion,
mais un vaisseau spatial !
<i>Basta</i> ! Moi vivant,
vous ne découvrirez jamais
le grand secret !
À plus, Animatronio !
UN MOIS PLUS TARD
Mon Dieu !
Pourquoi la machine de Léonard
nous a amenés ici ?
Je sais pas, demandons à ce mec.
Je suis Léonard.
Bienvenue sur la planète Vinci.
Mon Dieu !
J'allais dire la même chose.
Vous êtes vivant ? Ici ?
Vous avez appris mon grand secret.
J'étais un visiteur sur la Terre.
Je suis ce que vous appelez
un extraterrestre.
Un honneur de vous rencontrer.
Vous étiez génial dans <i>Titanic.</i>
<i>La Plage</i>...
C'est Leonardo DiCaprio,
espèce de débile.
C'était pas si bête
de manger des cailloux.
Les gens s'amusent où, ici ?
Vous aimez faire la fête
toute la nuit,
avec de la bière
et des filles faciles ?
- Et comment !
- Pas nous.
Nous passons notre temps libre
au musée des mathématiques.
La planète Vinci
est une sorte d'énorme université.
- Comment est votre équipe de foot ?
- Savante.
Je vais voir ce cours de maths.
Toute cette connaissance
fait bander mon cerveau.
Aimeriez-vous aussi
assister au cours ?
Ça entrerait par une oreille
et sortirait par un autre trou.
Allons nous asseoir.
Ça, je sais faire.
J'ai un terrible secret à vous dire,
M. DiCaprio.
Je suis un idiot.
J'aime ta franchise.
J'arrive même pas à vous comprendre.
J'ai aussi un secret.
Ici, sur la planète Vinci,
je suis le plus débile.
Quoi ?
Qui pourrait penser ça ?
Moi Léonard !
Je connais pas la masse
du Boson de Higgs.
Je dessine au crayon,
car le dessin sur ordinateur et moi,
ça fait deux.
Saleté de Biff !
- Il se croit intelligent.
- Il a aussi l'air plus fort.
Je partis sur Terre,
car cette humiliation m'exaspérait.
Mais être entouré
de gens plus stupides
était tout aussi énervant.
Je me vois dans votre bouton.
Inventer est ma raison d'être.
Ou l'était, car j'ai perdu
les plans de mon chef-d'oeuvre.
C'est ça ?
La <i>Machina Magnifica !</i>
Quelle joie !
Mon ami,
tu as redonné un sens à ma vie !
Ce cours de maths
était plus dur que prévu.
On doit répondre en chantant.
Je vais travailler dur ce soir,
pour ne pas être
humilié.
DÉCOUVERTE
DE LA MEILLEURE INVENTION DE LÉONARD
CONCERT DE DESSOUS DE BRAS DE FRY
Merci beaucoup.
Si vous avez aimé,
vous adorerez la suite.
Mesdames et messieurs,
Leonardo DiCaprio !
Plutôt, de Vinci !
Des siècles durant,
vous m'avez humilié.
Surtout toi, Biff.
Beau chapeau !
Mais, et enfin,
cette invention va vous épater.
Vous tous !
Admirez
ma machine de mort inarrêtable !
Et j'ai aidé ! Attendez...
vous aviez parlé
d'une machine à glace inarrêtable.
Les glaces sont
une fonction secondaire.
Sa vraie fonction est d'exterminer
tous ceux qui m'ont fait
me sentir inférieur !
J'ai trop peur !
On t'attend, le débile !
Vraiment ?
On va voir si vous rigolerez
quand ma machine
vous aura coupé la tête !
Léonard, attendez !
Je veux en être !
Vous êtes fou ?
Je hais ces nerds !
Ils pensent être plus intelligents
parce que je suis plus bête qu'eux.
Tuez-les tous,
en commençant par le prof de maths !
Je savais
que cette invention valait de l'or.
Le trio d'idiots va enfin se venger.
Je ne pense pas.
Avec vous,
j'ai honte de me qualifier d'idiot.
On trouve toujours
plus intelligent que nous,
donc pour être heureux,
on fait avec ce qu'on a.
Mais, tu n'as rien.
Vraiment ? J'ai un clou,
et un autre, pour taper dessus.
Et je vais arrêter
cette machine à glace infernale.
Quelle machine de mort !
Elle n'a tué personne !
Prends ça !
Pauvre Léonard de Vinci.
Il était vraiment stupide.
Fry, j'admire ce que tu as fait,
et je m'excuse
d'avoir insulté ton intelligence.
Ta minuscule intelligence.
Je recommence, débile.
Je veux dire, andouille.
C'est bon.
Je suis peut-être pas futé,
mais j'ai un grand coeur.
Ma mère me le disait souvent.
C'était une sage femme.
Aussi, que je suis pas beau.
Vraiment, une sage femme.

And welcome to...
Who Dares To Be A Millionaire?
Tremble
before Morbo's mighty likeability,
as I chit-chat
with our first contestant,
Philip J. Fry.
Give him hell, Morbo!
Prepare for pleasantries!
So, Fry, what do you do
for a living?
Me?
- Can I phone a friend?
- Chit-chat achieved!
Are you ready to play?
I didn't come to play.
I came to win.
Now let's play.
For one dollar...
Is it...
B, nail, final answer!
Sweet dodo of Lesotho!
Don't you ever stop to think
before you speak?
I never stop to think about it.
Leave Fry alone.
His intelligence is just a little...
differenty.
You a big dummy!
I'm beginning to think
you guys don't think I'm very smart.
You can barely remember
your own name, Einstein.
Einstein is a hard name to remember.
Smeesh, Professor.
Don't have a shmaneurysm.
Fry's your distant relative.
Not distant enough.
I'll be a monkey's uncle
if I'm this monkey's nephew.
But you're my only family.
Who will hug me
if I achieve something?
Perhaps I've been too harsh.
Come, lad, take my hand
and I'll explain
why I find you so repugnant.
All my life,
I've been inspired by great minds...
Euclid,
Copernicus, Braino...
And my personal role model,
Leonardo da Vinci.
What turned them to stone?
Da Vinci was history's greatest artist
and inventor.
<i>Voilŕ!</i>
He invented flying machines,
war engines, submarines...
- Nibbler died in the wall.
- That's not Nibbler.
That's my most precious possession.
Leonardo's beard!
I paid a fortune for it
at an auction of historic body parts.
I suppose
if I have an Achilles' heel,
it's because I bought it
at that same auction.
Indeed so.
Most indeededly.
Careful with that, you fool!
But possibly yes.
What is it?
It's da Vinci's
fabled lost invention.
Even the scholars
who wrote of this device
had no idea what it was for.
And now, at last, neither do I!
- Maybe we can figure it out.
- We?
Well, I may not have brain smarts,
but at least I have street smarts.
I was in the hospital two weeks.
- No one visited me.
- Quiet, you!
I'm trying to deduce the function
of da Vinci's lost invention.
Not even a card.
He might have hidden a clue
in one of his other works.
Ergo, I sent Bender out
for a copy of The Last Supper.
I'm back!
Everybody at Kinko's was an idiot,
so I just brought the original.
Jesus Christ...
and his 12 Apostles.
That's odd.
This hand here doesn't belong
to anybody.
And it's pointing a knife
at James the Lesser.
That's the great thing
about that hand.
And what about
these funky table legs?
It's like they're from some other,
funkier painting.
Maybe da Vinci painted
over something else.
It's called a pentimento.
That's true, Dr. Zoidberg.
How did you know that?
My doctorate is in art history.
Let's see
what's under The Last Supper.
Wait a second! I'm not big-boned.
I'm just fat.
My God! Look!
My God! I'm looking!
My God! Saint James was a robot!
My God! Da Vinci left
his legs unpainted as a clue.
My God! This is
the greatest mystery of all time.
We must fly to Rome
and exhume the body of Saint James.
Didn't we used to be
a delivery company?
To the ship.
Leela,
wanna join the mile-deep club?
Sure, why not?
No time!
I've found a clue that could unlock
all the secrets of history.
- Look at these Roman numerals.
- Roman numerals?
- I've got it! We're in Rome.
- Don't be stupid.
It's a long-lost mathematical code.
I'll need to consult
these ancient writings.
Some preposterous hogwash...
About the Fibonacci sequence...
The markings indicate
how many paces we need to take.
One...
Okay, we're there.
Brothers and sisters, let us pry.
It's true!
Saint James really was a robot.
I bet he's up
in Robot Heaven right now.
So he won't miss his eyes.
My God!
Robot Saint James is a zombie.
Nay, I am not Saint James.
Enough of your lies, Saint James.
We saw you in The Last Supper.
The great man Leonardo
built me as an artist's model.
When I took repose in this coffin,
I carefully tossed
the real Saint James
in yonder heap.
I'm sure you have many questions.
Come, there is a chamber
where I used to speak
with Pope John the Patient.
I told him
I'd be back in five minutes.
He'll make a nice heap.
I am Animatronio,
guardian of da Vinci's great secret.
He left my legs visible
in the painting as a clue,
then dispatched me hither
to await his shadow society
of intellectuals.
Hi, Animatronio.
You personally knew da Vinci?
Was he nice?
How did his hair smell?
And on a personal note,
what is the function of this device?
Halt! You know not the function
of the <i>Machina Magnifica</i>?
Then thou art not members
of the shadow society!
- The what, now?
- Not one more word shall I breathe.
Not even about the great fountain
where thou mayest find the...
Wait...
Thou didst not know about the fountain,
didst thou?
Curses!
I must be punished.
Quick, we must find out what he knows,
before he flays himself to death.
- Where is the great fountain?
- What makes it so great?
Why does a robot need a codpiece?
Fie, thou fen-suckled bumbailey!
Thou willst never pry information
from these mechanical lips!
Just tell us, already.
Okay,
the fountain thou seekest is...
And so dies our hope
of solving this mystery.
Come on, gang.
Let's go home.
Wait! Let's not give up so easily.
Animatronio mentioned a fountain.
That's a statue of Neptune,
god of water.
The number of points on his trident
is three, or "trey."
The "U" in his name
is written like "V."
Trey... V...
Trey...
Trevi!
It's the Trevi Fountain!
There can be no question!
- But Professor...?
- There can be no question!
It hasn't changed
in a thousand years.
Okay, everyone, into the fountain.
What are you, senile?
I'm not jumping in there.
Look... coins.
I got 48 cents.
There's one more nickel,
and it's a big one!
Quickly, into the sewer hole.
Why?
What's this dump?
It's the Pantheon!
This place is 3,000 years old.
What could possibly be left
to discover?
Maybe something about ourselves.
Wait! What's under that blanket?
Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!
It's truly a masterpiece.
Note how the perspective lines
draw the eye right to his dong.
Say, what's this?
Anyone hear something?
It's a coin slot.
Bender, insert that giant nickel.
Sure.
Hush, Bender!
What's your game, Vitruvian Man?
I withdraw the question,
Vitruvian Man.
Da Vinci's lost workshop.
At the risk of sounding stupid,
do these things actually work?
Of course not, stupid!
That flying machine's
as aerodynamic as a sofa!
How could it possibly
get off the ground?
In a way thou shalt ne'er discover!
Hi, Animatronio.
I feign death and stalk thee,
that I might preserve
the greatest of Leonardo's secrets.
All right, buddy,
we want secrets.
And they better be ancient!
<i>Porco metallico!</i>
Ne'er shall I reveal
how these wondrous machines
fit together!
They fit together?
I said no such thing.
And then I died!
You're right, Professor.
This thing doesn't fly.
Don't sit in there, you idiot!
That's dangerous!
No wonder this contraption
isn't aerodynamic!
It's not an aircraft,
it's a spacecraft!
<i>Basta!</i> As I live,
thou shan't discover
the great secret!
Bye, Animatronio!
Why would Leonardo's machine
have brought us here?
I don't know, let's ask this guy.
I am Leonardo.
Welcome to planet Vinci.
That's what I was gonna say!
You're alive? Here?
You've learned my great secret.
I was but a visitor to Earth.
In truth,
I am what you call "a space alien."
It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo.
And might I say,
you were great in <i>Titanic.</i>
<i>The Beach...</i>
That's Leonardo DiCaprio,
you blockhead!
Looks like eating rocks
wasn't as dumb as you said.
So what do people do for fun here?
Do you enjoy partying all night,
with plenty of ale and lusty women?
- I sure do!
- Not us.
We spend our leisure time
in the mathematics museum.
Planet Vinci
is basically
a single colossal university.
- How's your football team?
- Learned.
I'm going to check out
that math lecture.
All this knowledge
is giving me a raging "brainer."
Would you like to hear
the lecture, too, Fry?
No. It would just go in one ear
and our some other hole.
Come. Sit down.
Now, that I can do.
I have a terrible secret to confess,
Mr. DiCaprio.
I'm not very smart.
I appreciate your candor.
I don't even know
what language you're speaking.
I, too, have a confession.
You see, here on planet Vinci,
I am the stupidest person.
What?
Who'd possibly think you're stupid?
I'm Leonardo!
I don't know the mass
of the Higgs boson.
I have to draw in pencil,
'cause I don't know how to use
rendering software.
Stupid Biff!
- Thinks he's so smart.
- He looks stronger than you, too.
I went to Earth
because I could no longer stand
the ridicule.
But being surrounded
by even stupider people
was equally infuriating.
I can see myself
in your shiny button.
Inventing is what makes me happy.
Or did, until I misplaced the plans
for my masterpiece.
You mean these?
The <i>Machina Magnifica!</i>
Infinite joy!
Fry, my friend,
you have given my life meaning again!
That calculus lecture was harder
than I expected.
We had to answer every question
in the form of an opera.
I have a lot of homework for tomorrow,
if I don't want to be...
embarrassed.
Thank you. Thank you.
And if you like that,
you'll love our main event.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Leonardo DiCaprio!
I mean da Vinci!
For centuries, you've ridiculed me.
Especially you, Biff.
Nice hat!
But, at long last,
this invention will show you.
'Twill show you all!
Behold,
my unstoppable doomsday machine!
And I helped! Wait...
You told me it was
an unstoppable ice cream machine.
Ice cream is just a byproduct
of the machine.
Its primary purpose
is to exterminate
everyone who ever
made me feel inferior!
I'm so scared!
Bring it on, dum-dum!
Oh, yeah?
Let's see how hard you're laughing
when my doomsday machine
chops off your face!
Leonardo, stop!
I want in on this!
Are you crazy, Professor?
I hate these nerds!
Just 'cause I'm stupider than them,
they think they're smarter than me.
Kill them all...
starting with the math teacher!
I knew this final invention
would be a humdinger.
We three idiots
will finally have our revenge.
I don't think so.
You two make me ashamed
to call myself an idiot.
There's always going
to be someone smarter than you,
so the only way to be happy
is to make the most of what you've got.
But you've got nothing.
Oh, no?
I've got one single nail,
and another nail to nail it in with,
and I'm gonna stop this infernal
ice cream machine once and for all.
Some doomsday machine!
It barely killed anyone!
Well, take this!
Poor Leonardo da Vinci.
He sure was stupid.
Fry, I admire what you did today
and I'm deeply sorry
for insulting your intellect...
Your tiny, tiny intellect.
There I go again, you dope.
I mean, dummy.
It's okay.
I may not be clever,
but I have a good heart.
That's what my mom used to say.
She was a wise woman.
Also that I'm not much to look at.
A wise woman indeed.

J'ai peur de ne pas survivre
à cette reconstitution.
Et dire qu'on n'est qu'à 4 mètres
du parking.
C'est aussi cool
que la vraie Guerre Civile.
Pas la Guerre Civile.
C'est la Guerre Sith-ile.
Sith ?
Sith-rieux ?
Ils nous envahissent du ciel !
Je suis Dark Stroyer.
Dark Stroyer ?
- Le pire nom que j'ai jamais entendu.
- Écoutons les autres.
Dark Troce.
Dark Sploseur.
Dark Urtrier.
Dark Bruti.
Soldats, à l'attaque !
Ne tirez pas avant de voir
le vert de leurs yeux.
Ça économise des balles.
Je vais t'arracher leur coeur
et te le montrer.
C'est fait.
Plus la bougie éclaire,
plus elle est éphémère.
- T'es mort !
- Non, seulement très vieux.
Très bon jeu d'acteur.
C'est l'heure de la vengeance.
Dis à ma mère...
de venir me chercher
au centre commercial.
Trois morts.
Augmentez la cadence.
À ce moment de la vraie guerre,
il y avait déjà 98 millions de morts.
Les humains
et leurs organes fragiles.
Un petit coup dans le mou et...
T'es mort, Terrien.
Destin cruel, je suis mort.
Ils me mettent
en costume du dimanche
et me placent dans la boîte à sapin.
S'ensuit mon enterrement
dans le sol froid et glacial.
Et voilà les vers.
Tu rigolerais moins,
si t'étais vraiment mort.
C'est toi que la mort effraie,
au cas où t'avais pas remarqué,
je suis un robot.
Et si un truc lourd t'écrabouillait,
comme une église ?
Tu mourrais.
Mon unité de sauvegarde
fait une copie de moi chaque jour.
Si mon corps meurt, je m'en fous,
je me télécharge
dans un autre corps.
- Je suis immortel, bébé.
- Quoi ?
Alors, pourquoi tu cries autant
quand t'es en danger ?
J'ai jamais dit
que j'aimais pas dramatiser.
Et le gagnant de la guerre est...
Laissez-moi contrôler ma tabulation.
Facteur de rentes de veuves...
Dépêche-toi, saleté de compteur.
Tout le monde sauf moi
meurt de vieillesse.
Les gagnants, au coût net de 12 $
par vie tragiquement raccourcie,
nos Grands Seigneurs Siths.
Super victoire !
Enfin...
Victoire suprême.
- Bonne guerre...
- Bonne guerre...
C'était peut-être du flan,
mais j'ai bien les genoux en compote.
J'ai mal à des articulations
enlevées il y a un siècle.
Bender, amène-moi
ma chaise confortable à roues.
- Ta chaise roulante ?
- Pas besoin de ça !
Celle avec les roues.
Pauvres humains fragiles.
Vous aimeriez pas
être parfaits comme moi ?
Un brasier imposant
de perfection physique ?
Je déteste rabaisser ton ego démesuré,
mais t'es pas parfait.
- Si.
- Non.
- Si.
- Qui le dit ?
Le seul humain
dont je respecte l'opinion.
L'inspecteur cinq,
le meilleur
qu'un enfant puisse avoir.
Le jour de ma construction,
il m'a inspecté,
sans doute
avec des larmes de fierté,
et a proclamé au monde entier,
par ce bout de papier,
que j'étais parfait
et entièrement infaillible.
M. Parfait,
t'as mouillé ta chaise.
C'est pas moi.
Ça doit être de cette urine
dont vous vous vantez.
Non, c'est de l'huile.
Impossible.
J'ai trois couches, aucun risque...
T'appelles ça un jet d'encre ?
Salut, les amis.
C'est dû à quoi ?
Surchauffe,
à force d'enflammer des coeurs ?
Hélas, non.
C'est un symptôme d'un défaut fatal.
Mes fesses.
Si je meurs,
je copierai ma sauvegarde
dans un nouveau corps
tout aussi fabuleux.
Justement.
Tu ne pourras pas.
Tu n'as pas d'unité de sauvegarde.
Je ne sauvegarde rien ?
C'est ce que j'ai dit,
simple mortel.
Alors, si je meurs...
Tu meurs, ou comme tu le dis...
Veuillez m'excuser.
J'y crois pas !
Je vais mourir !
Combien de temps lui reste-t-il ?
Entre une minute
et un milliard d'années.
Au moins, tu peux t'y préparer.
Ça craint de crever !
Comment vivent les mortels ?
- Accès de colère.
- Débauche.
Grâce au déni, je suis immortel.
Je suis censé être parfait !
L'inspecteur cinq
m'a donné sa bénédiction !
Pourquoi me laisser naître,
si je peux mourir ?
Tu préférerais ne pas être né ?
C'est une perte de temps
de ne pas être immortel.
Ce sera un suicide.
Viens dans mon bureau.
J'offre de bons suicides.
Pas avant
que j'aie retrouvé l'inspecteur cinq
pour avoir une explication.
Je suis d'accord,
mais tu le trouveras pas.
Les inspecteurs
sont des gratte-papiers,
ils portent même du papier kraft,
en cas de manque.
Pas d'accord.
Sales bureaucrates, je les hais !
Tu pourrais trouver
l'inspecteur cinq
avec l'aide d'un autre bureaucrate.
- Hermes, mon pote.
- "Mon pote" ?
Tu me haïssais il y a 8,5 secondes.
Le temps arrange tout.
Tu sais quoi ? Je vais t'aider,
juste pour prouver que je suis pas
qu'un trieur de papiers.
Tu prends ton classeur portable ?
Mêle-toi de tes affaires.

Je m'absente une heure,

Désolé, j'ai fini ton blanco.
Une fois connecté, j'aurai accès

Je dois y réfléchir.
C'est inné, chez moi.

C'est impossible !
Lève-toi et regarde ça.

six !
Rien sur l'inspecteur cinq !
Mais c'est celui qu'on veut !
Si je bottais le cul
de l'inspecteur deux,

- L'addition n'est pas une solution.
Laissons tomber et rentrons.
Alors, je vais mourir,
sans pouvoir cogner le responsable ?
À quoi bon ?
Le suicide n'est pas une solution.
C'est pas une cabine à suicide.
C'est une cabine téléphonique.
Des cabines téléphoniques ?
Plus besoin de ce portable.
Qui est-ce ?
Où avez-vous eu ce numéro ?
C'est la compagnie robotique ?
Je veux me plaindre
d'un robot défectueux.
Je parle de moi !
Un robot défectueux ?
Ne bougez pas, mon cher.
Le SAV va arriver.
- Bender se relève enfin.
- À terre !
T'as appelé bombe-à-domicile ?
J'ai dit à la compagnie
que j'étais défectueux.
Sale shaker à cocktail !
M'man ne veut pas ternir son nom
avec un mauvais robot !
T'es foutu !
Je me téléchargerai dans...
Ah, mince.
Je peux mourir.
D'ailleurs...
t'as raison.
Le voilà, ton SAV.
Je peux plus courir.
Je vais sautiller.
Encore un peu.
On doit atteindre ces ours morts

Des ours morts
ne peuvent signifier qu'une chose.
Mais quoi ?
C'est le 7 h 38 !
Saute !
- On se tire !
- J'ai entendu tire !
INTERDIT

- On est foutu.

Pas sans la musique limbo.
Ça ira !
- On va se faire tuer.
- J'ai entendu tuer.
CHEMIN DE FER SOUTERRAIN
TRANSCONTINENTAL
- On a réussi !
- 12 heures de limbo.
Ça me rappelle ma lune de miel.
Tu te souviens des chauves-souris ?
- Bien sûr.
- C'était marrant.
On est où ?
Aucune idée.
BIENVENUE AU MEXIQUE

Tijuana est à un jet de pierre.
Tu vois ?

Une pierre est tombée
dans la banlieue de Tijuana.
Ça fait partie de la ville ?
Oui, je pense.
Voilà.
On fête notre fuite ?
On se fait une tequila
devant un combat de coq ?
Ouais. Attends.
J'ai été conçu ici.
L'inspecteur cinq
vit peut-être encore ici.
J'espère qu'il prie,
parce que je vais le transformer
en guacamole.
Il est Mexicain, moi aussi.
Je m'en occupe.
Voici nos passeports, visas,
et permissions territoriales.
Notariés et amidonnés.
Un pot-de-vin aurait fait l'affaire.
Pas mal, mon pote.
J'étais en Italie hier.
Ma maternité, fermée !
Même pas une tombe
avec un magasin de souvenirs
qui vend des <i>piñatas</i> de moi !
C'est fini.
Viens, on va voir un combat de coqs.
Attends !
C'est quoi, dans les poubelles ?
- Une tranche de fromage grignotée ?
- À côté !
Un manuel pour employés grignoté.
C'est l'adresse
de l'inspecteur cinq !
<i>Gracias</i> à ses fess-ias !
Où tu te caches, pauvre lâche ?
Viens te faire tuer comme un homme !
Bender, je crois que c'est la fin.
Ça se voit qu'il est parti.
C'est peut-être lui, déguisé !
Je vais te faire sortir
comme du dentifrice !
Bender, tu es un mortel.
Et l'inspecteur cinq a merdé.
Mais du coup,
le temps qu'il te reste est précieux.
Tu veux le gâcher
en restant énervé ?
Je sais pas !
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi me faire ça ?
Je voulais juste
un contrôle de qualité.
Mais il l'a mal fait,
donc je vais mourir.
Je méritais mieux !
Je suis Bender, quoi !
Je suis Bender !
Du calme. Tout va bien.
Tu es Bender,
et l'inspecteur cinq
ne le sera jamais.
Tu sais quoi ? T'as raison.
C'était un simple bureaucrate.
Bon pour la paperasserie.
Bon pour écraser sa chaise...
C'est pas contre toi, Hermes.
T'es pas pareil.
Enfin, si, mais t'es cool.
En vrai,
t'es sur ma liste "À ne pas tuer".
Allez, vieille branche.
On est à Tijuana.
Je veux m'éclater.
On va m'éclater !
Je retire ce que j'ai dit !
Sors de là !
Je vais simuler ta mort
via ce terminal
pour arrêter les robots.
On peut pas hacker ce terminal !
Je reste, point final !
Bonne chance.
<i>Bender exterminé.</i>
Bender est sauvé.
Cessez le feu.
M'man a annulé l'attaque.
- Étrange en tout cas, non ?
- J'ai entendu canon !
Il a réussi !
Et il ne regarde pas en arrière
alors que ça explose !
C'est un héros !
Il se passe quoi ?
Le téléphone est déconnecté,
le vaisseau est plus là
et Zoidberg est en train de cuire !
Ça n'a pas changé.
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
Trop de papiers !
Pas assez de plantes !
C'est pas grave.
Laisse-moi bureaucratiser
une petite heure.
Ça a l'air simple avec toi.
Je brûle beaucoup de papier
dans mon boulot.
Bender, t'as trouvé l'inspecteur ?
Mais grâce à ce cerveau,
je vois la vie autrement.
C'est sacrée et précieuse,
et on a
que quelques millions d'années ici-bas.
Alors, on va se torcher !

I fear I may not survive
this war reenactment.
I can't believe we're only 12 feet
from the parking lot.
This is every bit as fun
as the real Civil War.
Not the Civil War, private.
We're reenacting the Sith-al War.
Sith?
What the hoth?
Enemy invaders up in yonder sky!
I am Darth Stroyer.
Darth Stroyer?
That's the stupidest name
I've ever heard.
Let's hear the rest.
Darth Trocious.
Darth Sploder.
Darth Urderer.
Darth It-head.
Company, attack!
Don't fire till you see
the greens of their eyes.
It saves on bullets.
I shall rip out your heart
and show it to you.
It is done.
The candle
that burns twice as bright
burns half as long.
- You're dead.
- No, I'm just very old.
That's good acting.
It's payback time, Sploder.
Tell my mother...
To pick me up outside Quizno's.
That's three dead.
Let's pick up the pace, people.
At this point in the actual War,
the death toll was 98 million.
You humans and your fragile organs.
One little stab to the goo, and...
You're dead, Earth man.
Cruel fate, I'm dead.
They're putting me in my Sunday suit
and shoving me in a wooden box.
Now they're lowering me
into the cold, cold ground.
Hello, here come the worms.
If you were really dead,
you wouldn't be laughing so hard.
Death's a big deal
to you flesh bags,
but in case you didn't notice,
I'm a robot.
So? What if something heavy
fell on you, like a church?
You could still die.
My wireless backup unit
saves a copy of me every day,
If my body gets killed, big whoop,
I just download into another body.
- I'm immortal, baby.
- What?
Then how come you always scream
when you're in danger?
I never said I wasn't a drama queen.
And the winner of the war is...
Let me just cross-check
my tabulation here.
Factor in the corsages
for the widows...
Hurry up,
you number-crunching crumbnuncher.
Everybody but me
is dying of old age.
The winners, at a net cost
of only $12 per life
cut tragically short,
our Sith Overlords.
Hot diggity.
I mean...
Supreme diggity.
- Good war...
- Good war...
It may have been a fake war,
but my scuffed knee is all too real.
I've got pains in joints
I had removed a century ago.
Bender, bring me my soft chair
with the wheels on it.
- Your wheelchair?
- I don't need a wheelchair!
The one with the wheels.
Poor flimsy humans.
Don't you wish
you were flawless like me?
A towering inferno
of physical perfection?
I hate to pop your blimp-like ego,
but you are not perfect.
- Am so.
- Are not.
- Is too.
- Says who?
Says the only human whose opinion
I even remotely respect.
Inspector five,
the best inspector a kid could want.
The day I was built,
he looked me over,
probably with tears of pride
in his eyes,
and proclaimed to all the world,
by means of this scrap of paper,
that I was perfect
and infallible in every way.
Mr. Perfect,
you wet the chair.
Wasn't me.
Must be some of that urine
you're all so proud of.
That's not urine. It's oil.
Impossible.
I'm triple-sealed
to prevent any chance of...
You call that an ink defense?
Good-bye, friends.
What could have caused that?
Excessive heat,
on account of I'm so hot?
Alas, no.
I'm afraid it's a symptom
of a fatal defect.
Fatal, shmatal.
If I die,
I can download my backup copy
into a new, equally fabulous body.
That's just it. You can't.
You were built
without a backup unit.
There's no backup copy of me?
That's what I just said,
you mortal coil.
So, if I die...
You die, or as you put it...
Excuse me for a moment.
I can't believe it!
I'm gonna die!
How much time
does he have left, Professor?
Between a minute
and a billion years.
At least you can plan accordingly.
Dying sucks butt!
How do you living beings cope
with mortality?
- Violent outbursts.
- General sluttiness.
Thanks to denial, I'm immortal.
Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect!
Inspector five gave me his blessing!
How could he bring me into this world,
knowing I would die?
So you wish you
were never born, maybe?
Anything less than immortality
is a complete waste of time.
Then suicide it is.
Step into my office.
I'll give you a nice kevorking.
Not until I hunt down inspector five
and beat an explanation out of him.
I'm all for a good beating,
but you'll never find him.
Product inspectors are bureaucrats,
faceless bean-counters
who blend into the woodwork.
I beg to differ.
Stinkin' bureaucrats... I hate 'em!
Then again,
you might be able to find inspector five
with the help of another
seasoned bureaucrat.
- Hermes, old pal.
- Old pal?
8.5 seconds ago,
you said you hated me.
Time heals all wounds.
You know what? I will help you,
but only to prove
I'm not a paper-pushing file jockey.
Will you be taking
your portable filing cabinet?
None of your beeswax.
I'll only be away an hour,
but I'm counting on you
to do the all-critical filing
in my absence.
Shall we review alphabetical order?
- <i>A, B, C, D</i>...
- Get out of my office.
I'd like to request
a death certificate.
<i>Sorry, that's Building C.</i>
The Central Bureaucracy
maintains records on all bureaucrats.
We should be able
to look up inspector five.
Application for ingress approved.
And the other potential entrant?
- He's my pencil sharpener.
- You betcha!
Proceed.
I maintain a cubicle here
for weekend getaways.
Until now, I thought
giant cubes were exciting.
I did like the part
where they screamed.
This is mine,
right next to the Center Square.
Sorry, Hermes,
I drank all your white-out.
Once I log in,
I can access
inspector five's profile.
Damn it, it won't go on!
That's because you're not me.
Hooray, it won't go on!
The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone
but the assigned bureaucrat log in.
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>
<i>Also, you have a rectangular mass
in your colon.</i>
That's a calculator.
I ate it to gain its power.
You locate inspector five
while I slip
into my ass-kicking feet.
Sweet file-not-found
of Puegot sound.
His record's been blanked.
How am I gonna find
some anonymous guy
I don't know anything about?
I recommend the men's room
at the T.W.A. Terminal.
Okay, just file it alphabetically...
<i>A-B-C-D...</i>
This requires
a little extra thought.
I'm a natural.
The information we need will be here,
in the physical files.
Those bastards won't know
what leafed through them.
It's on.
No! This is impossible!
Quit blacking out and look at this.
Inspector One,
Two, Three, Four,
Six!
There's no trace of inspector five!
But five's the one we want!
Maybe if I kicked the asses
of inspector Two,
- plus inspector Three...
- Addition never solved anything, mon.
Let's cut our losses and go home.
So I'm doomed to die,
and I'll never even get
to punch whoever's responsible?
What's the point?
Suicide isn't necessarily
the answer.
It's not a suicide booth,
you lard ass.
It's a phone booth.
They have phones in booths now?
Finally, I don't have to lug
this cell phone around.
Who the hell is this?
How did you get this number?
Is this the robot company?
'Cause I have a complaint about
a defective robot.
His name is me!
A defective robot, you say?
Stay right there, dearie.
I'll have tech support
take care of you.
- Things are starting to look up.
- Look up!
Who did you call, dial-a-bomb?
No, I just told the robot company
I was defective.
You dumb cocktail shaker!
Mom won't allow a defective product
to tarnish her good name!
She'll kill you!
Big whoop.
I'll just download into a new...
Oh, right.
If I die, I die.
Speaking of which...
You're right. You're right.
That's what you get
for calling tech support.
I can't run anymore.
I'll have to skip.
Just a few more feet.
We have to get
to that pile of dead bears by 7:38.
A pile of dead bears
can only mean one thing.
But what?
It's the 7:38!
Jump!
- Shoot!
- Someone said shoot.
- Well, we're boned.
- No, we're not!
We just got to limbo.
But I'm not designed
to bend that low.
Not without limbo music.
That'll do it!
- We're gonna get fired.
- Someone said fire.
- We did it!
- 12 straight hours of limbo.
I haven't done
that since my honeymoon.
Hermes, Hermes,
remember that flock of bats?
- I sure do.
- That was fun.
Where are we?
I have no idea.
We're just a stone's throw
from Tijuana.
See?
<i>Dios mio!</i>
A rock has fallen here
in the outskirts of Tijuana.
Is it within the city limit?
I think, yes.
Told you.
You want to celebrate our escape?
Maybe grab a shot of Tequila
and take in a big-league cockfight?
Sure. No, wait.
I was built in Tijuana.
Maybe inspector five
still works there.
He better do some splainin'
before I mash up some face
guacamole.
He's Mexican, I'm Mexican.
Let me handle this.
<i>Sus papeles, por favor.</i>
Here are our passports, visas,
and Homeland Security permission slips.
Notarized and starched.
I also would have accepted a bribe.
Nice work, butterball.
I was in Italy last week.
My birthplace. It's closed!
There's not even a shrine to me
with a gift shop,
selling pińatas of me!
End of the line, mon.
Come on, we can still catch
a twi-night double-cockfight.
No, wait!
What's that in the Mexican garbage?
- Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper.
- No, next to that.
A half-eaten employee directory.
Inspector five's home address!
His ass-ias is <i>gracias</i>!
Where are you hiding, you coward?
Get out here
and get murdered like a man!
Bender,
I'm afraid our search is at an end.
He's obviously long gone.
Well, maybe this is him
in a costume!
I'm gonna squeeze you out of there
like Tijuana toothpaste!
Okay, Bender, you're mortal.
And okay, inspector five screwed up.
But that just makes the time
you have left all the more precious.
Do you really to waste
the rest of your life in a bitter,
homicidal rage?
I don't know!
Why?
Why did he do this to me?
All I wanted was
a little quality control.
But he didn't care enough,
and now I'm gonna die!
I deserved better!
I'm Bender, damn it!
I'm Bender!
There, there, mon.
It's gonna be okay.
You are Bender,
which is something inspector five
will never be.
You know what? You're right.
He was just a stupid bureaucrat.
A stupid, paper-pushing bureaucrat.
A stupid I-dotting,
chair-squashing...
No offense, Hermes.
You're not like that.
I mean, you're exactly like that,
but you're okay.
In fact, I'm putting you
on the do-not-kill list.
Come on, fellow mortal.
We're in Tijuana.
I want to live a little.
I'm gonna die!
That's the opposite of what I want!
Quick, run out the back!
I'll hack into inspector five's terminal
and fake your death,
they'll call off the kill-bots.
You know
that terminal is unhackable!
I'm not leaving you,
and that's final!
Good luck, buddy.
<i>Bender terminated.</i>
Bender's saved.
Cease fire.
Mom called off the attack,
- although I don't see how it's her.
- Someone said Howitzer!
He did it!
And he's not looking back
at that cool explosion.
He's a hero!
What's happening?
The phone's been disconnected,
the ship's repossessed
and Zoidberg's getting overcooked!
This place never changes.
What in the name of Jah happened?
Too much papers!
Not enough hiding plants!
It's all right.
This place just needs
a one-hour bureaucratizing.
You make it look so easy.
I've smoked a lot a paperwork
in my day.
Bender, did you ever find
that inspector guy you were looking for?
But thanks to this knucklehead,
I did find a new outlook on life.
It's precious and sacred,
and you only get so many millions
of years on this Earth.
So let's get brick-faced!
SI VOUS LE MATEZ PAS,
UN AUTRE LE FERA

<i>The Late Phllip J. Fry</i>
=:= Bite My Shiny Metal Ass Team =:=
Ne réveille pas Fry.
Mon coloc dort.
Réveille-toi !
Je vais m'amuser
avec cette demoiselle,
et je veux
qu'un maximum de gens le sache.
On peut avoir de l'intimité ?
On recommence.
La pause est finie,
on retourne dans la chambre.
Debout, voilà le café !
Je suis encore en retard.
Désolé.
Regardez qui se pointe enfin.
J'en ai marre de tes retards.
Tu dois arriver à la même heure
que les autres.
Leela n'est pas encore là.
Elle est partie.
Un idiot l'a invitée
pour son anniversaire.
Je suis en retard !
Puisqu'on vous a posé un lapin,
voilà de quoi vous réconforter.
Non, merci.
<i>Quel jour est-on là</i>
- <i>L'anniv de Leela</i>
- Arrêtez.
<i>Quel bel anniversaire, là</i>
J'aimerais
que vous arrêtiez de chanter.
Vous voulez
une part de gâteau à 11,95 $ ?
Joli gâteau.
Désolé de mon retard.
T'étais... ?
C'est rien.
- T'es pas fâchée ?
- Je l'étais.
Mais c'est ma faute,
j'ai pensé
que tu pourrais être à l'heure.
J'ai mangé nos deux plats.
T'as pris du homard,
c'était pas donné.
Je veux me rattraper.
Je t'invite pour un bon dîner,
ce soir à La Caverne des Jardins.
Un très bel endroit
pour se faire humilier.
Pas cette fois,
je serai là quoi qu'il arrive.
Les gars, Hadonis
se case enfin,
il épouse une maison en banlieue.
Mais ce soir,
c'est l'enterrement de vie de garçon
le plus fou de tous les temps !
Je préfère dîner avec Leela.
Va à ta fête débile.
On fera mon dîner d'anniversaire
une autre année.
Je peux vomir sur une strip-teaseuse
tous les jours.
Ce soir, je veux ne pas vomir...
sur toi.
Vraiment ?
Tant pis.
Professeur,
vous êtes mon coéquipier.
Très bien.
Cubert, mon dentier de boisson.
Je dois signer la carte de Leela.
Comment tu écris "XO" ?
Tu peux enregistrer ton message.
Tu la signes pas,
tu fais une vidéo à poil.
Forcément à poil ?
Peut-être pas.
J'y ai jamais pensé.
Si je pars maintenant,
enregistre le message en route,
m'asperge de parfum au kiosque,
je serai à l'heure.
Tu n'iras nulle part.
- J'ai un rencard.
- Tu étais en retard,
donc tu restes pour tester
ma dernière invention.
La voilà !
Une machine à voyager
dans le temps !
Le temps ? Je veux pas y retourner.
Mais cette machine
ne va que dans le futur.
Comme ça,
impossible de changer l'histoire
ou de faire un truc dégoûtant,
comme coucher avec sa grand-mère.
Je veux plus refaire ça.
On va la tester
en avançant d'une minute.
Entrez.
OK, finissons-en.
J'enregistrerai
la carte de Leela là-dedans.
Bon anniversaire.
Désolé,
j'aurai une minute de retard,
on teste la machine temporelle
du professeur.
On va avancer d'exactement
une minute dans le...
Ma carte !
On est allés trop loin ?
Quand exactement ?
L'an 10 000.
AN 10 000
Mon Dieu.
Enfin... oh, zut.
L'an 10 000 ?
J'ai promis à Leela
d'être à l'heure !
Du calme, tous nos amis sont morts
depuis des millénaires.
Tous nos amis ?
Je les ai jamais aimés.
Non ! C'est arrivé !
Ils se sont éradiqués !
Et les singes
ont aussi éradiqué leur société !
Comment est-ce arrivé ?
Et les oiseaux ont repris le pouvoir
et ruiné leur société.
Et les vaches, et...
Je sais pas. C'est une limace ?
AN 3010
En attendant votre ami,
permettez-moi de vous conter
l'histoire de notre caverne.
Ces formations rocheuses uniques
se sont formées
en plusieurs millions d'années
par de l'eau riche en minéraux
s'écoulant du plafond.
Goutte par goutte,
année après année,
siècle après siècle...
<i>Quel jour est-on là</i>
On vous a déjà posé un lapin
dans mon autre restaurant.
La ferme et amenez-moi deux dîners.
Quelqu'un a vu le cul de Fry ?
Il a rencard avec ma botte.
Fry n'est pas là,
il est sûrement à cette fête
avec Bender et le Professeur.
Fry est allé à la fête ?
<i>Nous interrompons</i> Hypnotoad on Ice
<i>pour un reportage sur la catastrophe
à la soirée d'Hedonismbot.</i>
<i>Ce qui commençait bien</i>
<i>a fini en tragédie,
quand un robot strip-teaser</i>
<i>fonctionnant au nucléaire
a vu son coeur fondre.</i>
<i>Il n'y a qu'un survivant.</i>
<i>Il y avait des corps partout.</i>
<i>Puis, ça a explosé.</i>
Mes trois collègues préférés
sont morts !
Fry est mort au lieu de venir ?
Je suis fâchée !
Non, je suis triste !
Mais je suis quand même fâchée !
Mais triste aussi.
- Je peux ?
- Il l'aurait voulu.
Et c'est ce que je suis !
AN 10 000
Le futur, ça craint.
Et tous ceux qui vivent ici aussi !
- C'est pas contre vous.
- T'inquiète pas.
Je reverrai jamais Leela.
Sans machine à remonter le temps,
on est coincés ici dans ce fourbi.
- On a compris.
- Attendez.
Je sais !
On peut pas remonter le temps,
mais on peut y avancer
jusqu'à ce que l'humanité invente
la machine à remonter le temps.
- Et on pourra rentrer.
- Compris.
<i>En l'an 105105, on verra,</i>
<i>Si l'homme vivra</i>
<i>Si le robot survivra</i>
<i>Ils trouveront...</i>
<i>En l'an 252525</i>
<i>La recherche de la machine
ne mène à rien</i>
<i>Il n'existe qu'une technologie</i>
<i>L'épée, pour la proctologie</i>
<i>En cette année finissant par vingt</i>
<i>Un triton essaiera
de se faire des copains</i>
<i>Il a l'air tête en l'air</i>
<i>Mais en vrai,

<i>En l'an un million et demi</i>
<i>Les girafes dominent sans merci</i>
<i>L'homme paie pour ses péchés</i>
<i>Et les feuilles d'arbre sont mangées</i>
AN 3030
Je n'arrive pas à croire
comment Planet Express
est devenue rentable
après la disparition du professeur.
Les temps ont été durs,
mais on s'en est sortis.
J'ai fait des calculs
pour notre stratégie spatiale...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je t'ai viré il y a 20 ans.
Je suis trop vieux
pour fuir comme ça.
J'aime la réussite,
mais le passé me manque.
AN CINQ MILLIONS
Pouvons-nous vous aider, étrangers ?
On vient du passé, cher nabot.
Je vois.
L'évolution de l'humanité a divergé
depuis votre époque.
Nous voilà,
intelligents et moraux.
Et les abrutos,
des brutes stupides
vivant dans les souterrains.
Intelligents, dites-vous ?
Avez-vous inventé
une machine à remonter le temps ?
Non,
mais avec nos esprits supérieurs,
ça ne prendrait que 5 ans.
À plus !
CINQ ANS PLUS TARD
On est là pour la machine !
AN DIX MILLIONS
On est dans quelle ère ?
Les machines...
Elles devaient faciliter notre vie,
mais elles se sont rebellées.
Elles tueront tous les humains.
Ça a l'air pas mal. On reste.
On peut se poser sur les crânes.
Y avait une belle vue
sur le Lac Sanglant !
AN 50 MILLIONS
Bienvenue, voyageurs temporels.
Abrutis !
Je préférais l'autre futur.
Comment vous le savez ?
Nous étudions les voyages temporels.
Nous avons trouvé une méthode
utilisant des champs de neutrinos
pour remonter le temps.
- Je m'appelle Hubert.
- On peut rentrer !
On parlera de ça demain.
Il y a très peu d'hommes par ici.
Même les vieux et les idiots
sont prisés.
Venez en tant qu'invités d'honneur
au banquet de fertilité.
Je ne vois aucun problème là-dedans.
Je mangerai. Et fertiliserai.
Très bien.
Nous allons vous enduire d'huile
sans les mains.
Alors, on peut rester
dans votre futur,
mais pas le mien ?
Suivant !
J'allais conclure !
Elles avaient
une machine à remonter le temps !
Mon monde était pas mal aussi !
Vous avez vu cette pile de crânes ?
Oh, toi !
T'as pas fait ça.
Leela m'attend quelque part,
à une certaine heure.
On doit continuer de chercher.
Fry a raison.
Ouais, on doit collaborer,
pas se battre,
même si j'allais gagner.
L'an un milliard.
Je sens que c'est le bon moment
pour trouver ce qu'on cherche !
Toute vie a disparue.
Alors, avançons.
Pas la peine.
La Terre est morte.
C'est la fin.
La Caverne des Jardins.
Je suis là, Leela.
En retard d'un milliard d'années.
CHER FRY
AN 3050
Tu l'auras ta pension alimentaire.
Va-t'en.
Relax.
Je suis venu voir Amy.
On y va, mon beau.
Mamie t'emmène à Atlantic City.
Pourquoi t'as épousé ce minable ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je suis mariée au travail, maintenant.
Je croyais avoir une âme soeur,
mais...
Bizarre.
Une vieille carte d'anniversaire
où on enregistre son voeu.
<i>Joyeux anniversaire, Leela !
Désolé, j'aurai une minute de retard,</i>
<i>on teste la machine temporelle
du professeur.</i>
<i>Mais bon anniversaire, tout ça et...</i>
<i>Je t'aime.</i>
<i>Ma carte !</i>
Je lui en ai voulu toute ma vie,
et c'était pas sa faute.
<i>Cher Fry,</i>
<i>on a eu peu de temps ensemble,</i>
<i>mais c'était le meilleur moment
de ma vie.</i>
Vous savez, j'ai eu une bonne vie.
Et si on regardait la fin de l'univers
devant une bière ?
Bonne idée !
C'est ce que je fais tous les jours.
À la fin de l'univers !
À plus, la Terre.
Merci pour l'air et tout.
Quel était le but de la vie ?
Qui sait ?
Sûrement une sottise
sur l'esprit humain.
On dirait bien.
Les étoiles s'éteignent.
Quel grand vide !
Oui, c'est bon, j'ai compris.
Le dernier proton
devrait être en train de se désintégrer.
Salut, dernier proton.
Et...
Nous y voilà.
La fin de l'univers.
Et maintenant ?
- On discute ?
- Non merci.
- Vous avez vu ça ?
- Incroyable !
Un deuxième Big Bang !
Mon Dieu,
est-ce possible ?
Sûrement,
c'est en train de se produire.
D'ailleurs, c'est quoi ?
Cet univers semble être
identique à l'ancien.
Dans ce cas,
on doit avancer dans le temps
jusqu'à la date de notre départ !
La Terre est née !
Mesdames et messieurs, la Lune !
Là.
Le premier poisson sorti de l'eau.
Il venait sur nous !
Tu l'as vu.
Je vais prendre une bière.
Tu rates les dinosaures !
C'est pas grave.
Ils ne vont pas disparaître.
Ils sont où ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- C'est l'Histoire.
Attendez, j'ai un truc à faire.
Doucement, doucement.
On va se poser.
Plus qu'un an.
Six mois.
J'arrive, Leela.
Un mois...
Deux semaines...
Une heure...
30 secondes...
Attention, et...
Donne-moi les clés !
On va devoir refaire un tour.
Ralenti un peu.
Je vais tuer Hitler par la fenêtre.
Zut !
J'ai tué Eleanor Roosevelt.
On approche de notre ère.
Nous voici.
Attention, cette fois.
Attention.
Nous allons la tester
en avançant d'une minute.
- Montez.
- Dépêchons-nous.
Ce nouvel univers
est 3 m plus bas que l'ancien.
On a réglé
le paradoxe du voyage temporel.
- Super !
- Youpi !
Je suis en retard pour le dîner.
Bienvenue à La Caverne des Jardins.
Du pain de viande pour patienter ?
Excuse mon retard.
Tu es à l'heure, en fait.
Ah oui ?
J'avoue que j'ai eu peur
que tu ne viennes pas.
Ça, c'est l'ancien Fry.
Il est mort.
Joyeux anniversaire.
Je t'ai acheté une carte,
mais j'ai dû la perdre.
Pas grave,
je n'aime pas trop les cartes.
Je me souviendrai
de nos moments ensemble.

<i>The Late Philip J. Fry</i>
=:= Bite My Shiny Metal Ass Team =:=
Don't wake up Fry.
My roommate's sleeping!
Wake up already!
I'm about to get down and funky
with this ladybot,
and I'd appreciate it if as many people
as possible could know about it.
Now can we get some privacy?!
Back it on up.
Okay, Hambone break's over.
Back to the bedroom!
Wake up and feel the coffee!
I'm late for work again!
Sorry I'm late.
Look who decided to show up.
I've had it with your tardiness.
I expect you to arrive
the same time as everyone else.
Wait a second.
Leela's not here yet.
She left a while ago.
She said some idiot was taking her
to lunch for her birthday.
I'm late!
Since you got stood up, I thought
this might cheer you up a notch.
That's not necessary.
<i>What day is today</i>
- <i>It's Leela's birthday</i>
- Please stop.
<i>What a day for a birthday</i>
I really would like you
to stop singing.
You want to buy
a slice of birthday cake for $11.95?
Please.
Nice cake.
Sorry I'm late.
Where have you...
It's fine.
You're not mad?
I was.
But then I realized
it's actually my fault
for thinking you might be
on time for once.
Anyhow, I ate both our lunches.
You ordered the lobster pileup.
It wasn't cheap.
Please, let me make it up to you.
I'll treat you to a fancy birthday
dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.
That'll be the nicest place
I've ever been stood up.
Not this time. No matter what happens,
I swear I'll be there.
Guys, guys! Hedonismbot
is finally gonna settle down
and marry a nice house in the suburbs!
But tonight,
he's having the girls gone
wildest bachelor party of all time!
Cares?
I'm having dinner with leela.
Just go to your stupid party.
We can have dinner
on my birthday some other year.
I can throw up
on a stripper anytime.
Tonight, I want to not throw up...
On you.
Really?
Your loss.
Professor, you're my wingman!
Very well.
Cubert, fetch my drinking teeth.
I just have
to sign Leela's birthday card.
How do you spell "XO"?
It's a record-your-own-message card.
You don't sign it.
You leave a nude video greeting.
Does it have to be nude?
I guess not.
That never occurred to me.
If I leave now,
record a birthday greeting on the way,
score some fancy cologne
at the newsstand,
- I'll be exactly on time.
- You're not going anywhere!
- But I have a date.
- You were late this morning,
so you have to stay
and test my latest invention!
Behold!
A time-traveling machine!
Time? I can't go back there!
But this time machine
only goes forward in time!
That way you can't accidentally
change history
or do something disgusting,
like sleep with your own grandmother.
I wouldn't want to do that again.
We're going to test it
by going forward in time one minute.
Get in.
Hurry. Let's get it over with.
I can record Leela's birthday card
while we're in there.
Happy Birthday, Leela!
I'm really sorry
I'm gonna be one minute late,
'cause we're testing
the Professor's dumb time machine...
I'll just nudge us forward exactly
one minute into the...
My card!
Did we go too far?
What time is it?
The year 10,000.
Oh, dear.
I mean, oh, my.
The year 10,000?
But I promised Leela
I'd be on time for dinner!
Relax, Fry.
Everyone we ever knew died
thousands of years ago.
Everyone we ever knew?
I never liked those guys.
No! They did it!
They blew it up!
And then the apes blew up
their society, too!
How could this happen?
And then the birds took over
and ruined their society!
And the cows, and then...
I don't know.
Is that a slug maybe?
While you await your "friend",
allow me to read
from a prepared history of our Cavern.
"These unique rock formations
"were created over millions of years
by mineral-rich water
"dripping from pores in the ceiling.
"Dripping and dripping,
"year upon year,
"century upon century..."
<i>What day is today?</i>
<i>Aren't you the loser who got stood up
at my other restaurant?</i>
Just shut up
and bring me two dinners.
Has anyone seen Fry's ass?
It's late for a date with my boot.
Fry's not here.
Obviously, he went to that pervert party
with Bender and the Professor.
Fry went to the party?
<i>We interrupt</i> Hypnotoad on Ice
<i>to bring you breaking coverage
of the disaster</i>
<i>at Hedonismbot's bachelor party.</i>
<i>Linda, what began as innocent fun</i>
<i>ended in tragedy tonight
when a nuclear-powered</i>
<i>robot stripper suffered
a catastrophic reactor meltdown.</i>
<i>There is only one survivor.</i>
<i>Everywhere I looked,
there were piles of bodies.</i>
<i>And then the explosion struck.</i>
The three co-workers I liked
are all dead!
Fry stood me up and died?
I'm so angry!
I mean, I'm so sad!
But I'm still pretty angry!
But also sad.
- Can I be both?
- It's what he'd want.
Then that's what I am!
Man, the future is a total craphole,
and whoever lives here
is a crap-faced sack of crap!
- No offense, fellas.
- Don't sweat it, man.
I'll never see Leela again.
No,
without a backwards time machine,
we're stuck in this craphole.
- Dude, give it a rest.
- Hold on!
I've got it!
We can't go back in time,
but we can keep going forward
until people invent
the backwards time machine.
- And then we can go home.
- Hit it.
<i>In the year 105105</i>
<i>If man is still alive</i>
<i>If robot can survive</i>
<i>They may find...</i>
<i>In the year 252525</i>
<i>The backwards time machine
still won't have arrived</i>
<i>In all the world,
there's only one technology</i>
<i>A rusty sword
for practicing proctology</i>
<i>In a future year that ends with 20</i>
<i>A shlubby merman's gonna try
to get chummy</i>
<i>He may look like a watery wimp</i>
<i>When in fact
he's a bloodthirsty shrimp!</i>
<i>In the year one million and a half</i>
<i>Humankind is enslaved by giraffe</i>
<i>Man must pay for all his misdeeds</i>
<i>When the treetops
are stripped of their leaves</i>
Sometimes I can't believe
how successful Planet Express
became once the Professor was killed
and you seized control.
There were tough times,
but we all pulled together.
I've been crunching the numbers
on our trans-galactic strategy...
What are you doing here?
I laid you off 20 years ago.
The claws can't flee
like they used to.
Success is nice,
but I do kind of miss the old days.
May we help you, strange ones?
We are travelers from the past,
my good runt.
I see.
Since your time,
human evolution has diverged.
There are we,
advanced in intellect and morality.
And the dumblocks,
stupid, vicious brutes
who live underground.
Advanced in intellect, you say?
Have you invented
a backwards time machine?
No, but if we apply
our superior minds,
we could perfect such
a device within five years.
See you then!
We're back for our time machine!
What's this era
in human history like?
The machines...
We built them to make our lives easier,
but they rebelled.
They won't stop
until every human is dead.
This seems like a nice future.
Let's just stay here.
We could settle down
on that mountain of skulls.
That place had a gorgeous view
of Blood Lake!
Greetings, time travelers.
Stupid jerks!
Wouldn't let me stay in the good future.
How did you know
we're time travelers?
We, too,
study the time travel enigma.
We have perfected a method
using negative-mass neutrino fields
that allows us
to travel backwards in time.
- My name's Hubert.
- All right! We can go home!
We can talk
of our research tomorrow.
Men are very rare in our society.
Even very old and stupid males
are prized.
Tonight, please be the guests of honor
at our fertility banquet.
There's certainly no harm
in a fertility banquet.
I could eat.
And fertilize.
Very well.
Let us anoint our guests in oil
without using our hands.
So we can stay
in the future you like,
but not the future I like?
Next.
I was about to close the deal!
Bender, they had
a backwards time machine!
The other place had
a lot of good things, too!
Did you even see
that mountain of skulls?
Why, you!
No, you didn't.
Stop! Somewhere, some time,
Leela is waiting for me.
We need to keep looking
for a backwards time machine.
Fry's right.
Yes. We have to work together,
not have this fight,
which I was definitely winning.
The year one billion.
I've got a feeling
this could be exactly
the point in time
we've been looking for!
In fact, all life is extinct.
So let's keep going forward.
It's no use.
Earth is dead.
This is the end of all things.
The Cavern on the Green.
I made it, Leela.
Sorry I'm a billion years late.
You'll get your alimony check, Cubert.
Now get lost!
Chill out.
I'm just here to see Amy.
Move it, boy toy.
Granny's taking you
to Atlantic City.
I don't know why you ever married
that pig-nosed punk.
I don't know, either.
I'm married to the job now.
I used to think there was someone
for me, but...
How odd.
It's one of those old
record-your-own-message birthday cards.
<i>Happy Birthday, Leela! I'm really sorry
I'm gonna be one minute late,</i>
<i>'cause we're testing
the Professor's dumb time machine...</i>
<i>But, you know,
happy birthday and all, and...</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>My card!</i>
My whole life I've been mad at him,
and it wasn't his fault.
<i>Dear Fry,</i>
<i>our time together was short</i>
<i>but it was the best time of my life.</i>
You know, all in all,
I had a good life.
What do you say
the three of us grab a six-pack
- and watch the universe end?
- Hear! Hear!
That's basically
what I do every day.
To the end of the universe!
So long, Earth.
Thanks for the air and whatnot.
What was the purpose of life,
anyway?
Who knows.
Probably some hogwash
about the human spirit.
Sounds about right.
The stars are receding.
Oh, the vast emptiness!
Yeah, yeah, I can take a hint.
The last proton
should be decaying about now.
Bye, last proton.
And...
here we are.
The end of the universe.
Well, now what?
- You guys want to talk?
- No, thanks.
- Did anyone else see that?
- Unbelievable!
It's a second Big Bang!
My God,
is it possible?
It must be possible. It's happening.
By the way, what's happening?
It appears this universe
is exactly identical to the old one.
If so, we just need
to keep going forward
in time to the point when we left!
The Earth is born!
Ladies and gentlemen, the Moon!
Look.
The first fish to crawl up on land.
It was coming right at us!
You saw it.
I'm gonna grab another beer.
You're missing the dinosaurs!
It's okay.
They're not going anywhere.
Where'd they go?
- Now, what's going on there?
- History.
Hang on.
I just want to make one stop.
Easy. Easy.
Taking her in for a landing.
One year to go.
Six months.
I'm almost there, Leela.
One month...
Two weeks...
One hour...
30 seconds...
And here we...
Give me the keys, Magoo!
We'll have
to bring her around again.
Just slow it down.
I'll shoot Hitler out the window.
Darn!
I hit Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake.
Nearing our era again.
Here we go.
Careful this time.
Careful.
We're going to test it by going forward
in time one minute.
- Get in.
- Okay. Hurry. Let's get it over with.
This new universe is about
ten feet lower than our old one.
We took care
of the time travel paradox.
- All right!
- Yabba-dabba-doo!
I'm late for dinner with Leela.
Welcome to Cavern on the Green.
May I offer you some meat loaf
while you wait?
Sorry I'm late!
Actually, you're on time.
Really?
I have to admit,
I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
That was the old Fry.
He's dead now.
Happy Birthday, Leela.
I got you a card,
but I guess I kind of lost it.
That's okay.
I don't really like cards.
What I'll remember
is our time together.

Nibbler a fait un popo pour maman.
Je vais le ramasser
avec ma super pelle à popo.
Champ magnétique du noyau...
31 microteslas.
Génial.
Température...
Le P.I. du magma
est à 10 000° Selleck.
Je collecte des données,
tu peux aller jeter ça ailleurs ?
Impossible. C'est de la matière noire
très volatile.
Et du maïs.
Je présente ma thèse demain
et j'ai pas pu me préparer.
Balivernes.
Tu es ma thésarde depuis 12 ans.
Ça fait 6 ans que tu es prête.
- Quoi ?
- J'aurais peut-être dû te le dire.
Bref, l'important,
c'est d'être détendue demain.
- Vous êtes sûr ?
- Oui.
Va décompresser,
comme les jeunes savent le faire.
Va faire un tour en voiture.
Mets un t-shirt
et mange un poisson pané.
Allez !
Les amis, un petit verre
pour aider Amy à se relaxer.
Santé !
Je suis toujours nerveuse.
Un autre petit verre
pour aider Amy à se relaxer.
Toujours nerveuse ?
C'est une boule de nerfs !
J'ai peut-être pas de copain,
mais au moins,
je t'ai toi, mon petit chou.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Parler ?
Tu peux pas me quitter,
t'es mon animal.
J'apprécie beaucoup
d'être l'objet de ton affection,
mais je suis un être
très sophistiqué
qui rêve
de conversation intelligente.
Chouchou se sent pas chtimulé ?
Quel euphémisme ! Il est temps
que tu me traites avec respect.
Tu veux être traité
comme un membre de l'équipe ? OK.
Tu n'iras plus dans mon sac,
et je t'habillerai plus
avec le mignon costume de marin.
Je te l'ai déjà dit,
c'est mon vrai uniforme naval.
- Chez toi ou chez moi ?
- Les deux.
Mais d'abord, ici.
Il reste une place ?
Je pensais t'avoir réglée
pour 7 h 15.
Désolée.
J'étais avec Bender, hier soir.
Il s'est amusé avec mes boutons.
Mais ma soutenance de doctorat
est dans 10 minutes,
sur Mars !
Kif, t'as vomi sur le sol ?
Oui, il l'a fait.
Où est votre candidate ?
J'ai beaucoup d'étudiants
à humilier aujourd'hui.
- Vous êtes en retard.
- Mon Dieu,
on se croirait
dans un de ces cauchemars.
Prends ma blouse.
Laissez-moi vous présenter les juges
par ordre de mauvais caractère.
Professeur Ogden Wernstrom.
Wernstrom.
Professeur de physique appliquée,
Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate.
Je vois dans votre CV
que vous êtes sagittaire.
Et professeur
Fischerpreis Parléhépèl.
La vache dit...
Il l'a prouvé il y a 50 ans,
et depuis, il le rabâche.
Je suis l'estimé
professeur Morris Sha,
vous me faites perdre mon temps.
Allez-y.
- Imaginez...
- Mon Dieu.
... un générateur géant sphérique,
fournissant une énergie illimitée
grâce à son mouvement perpétuel.
Jeune fille, vous avez bu ?
Oui, mais ce n'est pas pernitent.
Je parle de la Terre.
Le générateur, c'est la Terre.
Imaginez que ce ballon de basket
est le monde.
C'est le cas
pour beaucoup de jeunes.
En tournant, elle produit
un énorme champ magnétique.
En utilisant ce champ
pour générer du courant électrique,
nous pourrions exploiter
l'énergie rotative de la T...
er... atchou !
Prendre l'énergie de la Teratchou.
Continue.
Désolée, je suis très allergique
aux chats.
Professeur Sha,
ça vous dérangerait ?
Mlle Wong, tout me dérange.
Il suffit de polariser
le coeur terrestre avec une immense...
charge statique...
en enroulant
du câble superconducteur...
Désolée.
Assez.
Les membres du comité vont voter.
- Non.
- Non.
Non de non.
Le cheval dit : "Doctorat refusé".
T'en fais pas.
J'ai pas de diplôme, moi non plus,
mais je suis un membre important
dans le secteur de la livraison.
En tant que membre de l'équipe
à part entière,
je vous dédie ma loyauté,
ma perspicacité
et, si je puis dire, mon amitié.
Leela, fais-le taire.
On n'arrête pas une réunion
pour un mignon...
Regardez, un petit chat.
Toi ?
Va-t'en, tas d'histamines !
Laisse le minou.
J'essaie de faire marcher
une entreprise,
- donc le chat est pour moi.
- Non, moi.
Son anus ressemble à un astérisque.
Capitaine boule de poil
au rapport...
plutôt, au ronron.
Mon meilleur ami est mort
dans cet uniforme.
Je hais ce chat.
Si j'avais un spray,
je le giclerais.
Tu sais quoi,
impossible d'être aussi chou
sans un but caché.
Tu veux que je te change ?
Il faudra l'observer de près.
Pense au talc.
Voici ma nouvelle théorie :
c'est un chat adorable.
Je devais être jaloux,
tout simplement.
Ça me manque
d'être le chouchou de Leela.
Je vais m'excuser
et espérer une caresse de bonté.
Oui, seigneur.
Amy et Nibbler
sont une menace tewwible.
Ils doivent être stérilisé
et castré, wespectivement.
Le chat est diabolique,
on en a la preuve.
Il appelait une soucoupe.
Bien sûr qu'il voulait une soucoupe,
espèce d'idiot.
Une soucoupe de cwème délicieuse.
Imbécile,
ce n'est pas pour la crème.
Ça se pwononce "cwème".
Je caresse le mien très fort.
Touche sa douce fouwwuwe.
Gwatte ses joues pelucheuses.
Regawde ce poil soyeux.
Cawesse, cawesse.
Que font-il avec autant de laine
et de cobalt ?
Ils font quelque chose en bas.
On doit découvrir quoi.
Tu vas où, sans chat ?
La cave. J'ai laissé
le hockey sur table allumé.
Sans chat,
tu vas nulle part.
Tu peux nous dire
ce qu'il se passe ?
On ne construit rien de sinistre,
si c'est ce que tu insinues.
Viens, quelque chose de sinistre
ne se construit pas tout seul.
Le nom du professeur Sha est Sha.
Il serait impliqué avec ces chats ?
Cette conclusion
est aussi inéluctable que débile.
Allons le voir,
et s'il ne nous parle pas,
il parlera à Smith & Wesson.
Ou au Super Réducteur de Tête.
Professeur Sha,
nous voulons des réponses.
Je vous préviens,
si je dois être chou,
ça va être moche.
Il est mort !
C'est quoi, ces ficelles ?
C'est quoi... ?
Il n'est pas mort.
C'est une de ces marionnettes
pour chiens
adaptée pour les chats !
Mon doctorat a été refusé
par cette boule de poil ?
Vilain chat !
Ils ont construit
le cliquet de ma thèse !
Voyez donc cela.
- Tu parles !
- Tu parles ?
Quelle ironie.
Deux êtres hyper intelligents
prétendant être
des animaux de compagnie.
Tu connais Obliteron ?
Il prétend être un hamster, mais...
C'est génial.
Dis-nous ce qu'il se passe.
Quoi ? Ah, oui.
Mes associés et moi
venons de la neuvième planète
de l'étoile appelée Thuban.
Il y a longtemps,
la vie y était idéale.
<i>Le soleil fournissait
de la chaude et reposante lumière.</i>
<i>Les poulets-saumons vagabondaient.</i>
<i>Mais un désastre était imminent.</i>
<i>La rotation de notre planète
ralentissait.</i>
<i>Au début, cela semblait bénéfique.</i>
<i>De longues nuits pour dormir.</i>
<i>De longues journées pour dormir.</i>
<i>Puis, il fit trop chaud.</i>
<i>Et trop froid.</i>
<i>Nos scientifiques
se mirent au travail.</i>
<i>Ils localisèrent
une planète ayant la bonne orientation</i>
<i>et le bon champ magnétique
pour récolter son énergie rotative.</i>
La Terre.
Tout à fait. Nous l'appelons
boule brillante bleue.
ÉGYPTE : 3 500 Av. J.C.
<i>Dans l'Égypte ancienne,</i>
<i>mon peuple construisit
une antenne géante semi-octaèdre</i>
<i>pour transmettre l'énergie de la Terre
à Thuban.</i>
<i>La grande pyramide de Gizeh !</i>
<i>Les Égyptiens
nous prenaient pour des dieux,</i>
<i>mais ironiquement,
cela causa notre perte.</i>
<i>Ils nous bichonnaient
avec de magnifiques festins</i>
<i>et de tendres victuailles.</i>
<i>Nous sommes devenus gros
et domestiqués.</i>
<i>Des milliers d'années ont passé</i>
<i>et notre monde était proche
d'une destruction totale.</i>
La ferme !
Mais la technologie pouvant
sauver notre planète fut perdue.
Jusqu'à ce que je vous entende
parler à l'université de Mars.
T'as traité ma thèse
de gros sac de vomi,
et tu l'as volée ?
Bienvenue à l'Académie.
Il veut voler l'énergie rotative
de la Terre !
La Terre s'arrêtera et...
La moitié grillera
et l'autre moitié gèlera.
La Terre deviendra
une grosse Coupe Danemark.
On a découvert ça l'année dernière.
Alors, pattes malignes,
vous avez construit le cliquet,
mais impossible d'atteindre
le noyau sans 6 000 km
de câble superconducteur.
La boule de laine !
Exact.
Même ainsi,
il faut une charge statique
très puissante pour le déclencher.
Un chat s'est-il déjà frotté
contre toi ?
Si c'est une proposition,
je ne suis pas intéressé.
Je parle de la charge générée
par 50 000 félins
qui se frottent contre une surface.
Bientôt,
le monde s'arrêtera de tourner
et vous ne pouvez rien faire
pour l'arrêter.
L'arrêt du monde
ne peut être arrêté.
Excusez-moi.
La Terre s'arrête.
Regardez les chats et poussez.
Ces chats de l'espace
utilisent une forme d'hypnose
hyper-chou.
On est deux à pouvoir faire ça.
Et l'un des deux, c'est moi.
Nibbler ? Mon chouchou ?
M. Winkles, Caramel.
Vite, dansez ensemble.
Ils sont très forts.
On s'arrête.
Tous les chats à vos postes.
Fête de plage catastrophique...
Scène 1.
Effets de désastre...
Action !
Coupez.
Le figurant a regardé la caméra.
On recommence.
Et maintenant, transférons l'énergie
de votre planète à mon monde.
Eh bien,
fêtons ça.
Que font ces poils de chat
sur mon pull ?
Pourquoi je suis plein de sable ?
Et de bonbons ?
Vous étiez sous l'emprise
de ces odieux chats de l'espace !
Savourez votre rôtissage
sous le soleil,
et l'oiseau mort qu'on a laissé
dans vos pantoufles.
Vite ! En tournant le cliquet
dans l'autre sens,
nous pourrions peut-être
redémarrer la Terre.
C'est bloqué.
- Pousse plus fort, Bender !
- Je peux pas !
T'aurais dû appeler mon cousin,
Tourneur.
C'est sans espoir.
L'engin ne peut tourner
que dans une direction.
On peut ouvrir la fenêtre ?
Il commence à faire chaud.
C'est mieux ?
Mince, qu'il fait chaud.
Pourquoi j'ai inventé
cet horrible engin ?
La technologie n'est intrinsèquement
ni bonne ni mauvaise.
C'est la façon dont on s'en sert.
Comme le Rayon de la Mort.
Vous avez peut-être raison.
La science doit continuer à avancer
avec l'espoir que...
C'est ça ! Avancer !
Je sais comment
redémarrer la Terre !
Impossible de trouver une idée
en assemblant des mots.
C'est ça !
Je vais assembler ton comité !
Le cliquet ne peut reculer,
mais si on continue à le pousser,
la Terre recommencerait à tourner !
Oui, dans le sens inverse !
Et ?
Messieurs,
mesdames,
faisons tourner le monde.
Ça marche ! Un peu plus vite.
On n'en peut plus.
Regardez Nibbler !
Globalement,
la société terrestre ne vaut rien.
Mais ils ont des choses appelées :
vieux tapis,
parfaits pour faire ses besoins.
Bon spectacle.
Même si le monde tourne désormais
dans le mauvais sens,
c'est bien.
Bien joué, Amy.
Je suis honoré de vous présenter,
à contre coeur, votre doctorat.
En physique appliquée.
Et un prix de sport
qui trainait dans ma boîte à gants.
J'ai enfin fini l'école !
Comment est le marché du travail ?
Félicitations, Dr Wong !
Permission de monter à bord ?
Accordée, chouchou.
Un futur brillant t'attend.
Aussi sûr que le soleil
se couche à l'est.
Cash, cash, cash for your bones.
Too many bones, not enough cash?
Call Cashbone!
Ribs, skulls, spines,
even certain tiny ear bones.
The leg bone's connected
to the Cashbone.

Nibbler made a bobo for Mama.
I'll pick it up
with my supey-dupey poopy scoopy.
Core magnetic field...
31 microteslas.
Nice.
Temperature...
The magma P.I.
is 10,000 degrees selleck.
I am collecting data.
Could you dump that somewhere else?
Not really.
It's highly volatile dark matter...
And some corn.
But I'm presenting my thesis tomorrow
and I've barely had time to prepare.
Nonsense.
You've been my grad student
for 12 years.
You were ready six years ago.
- What?
- I probably should have told you.
Anyway, the important thing
is to be relaxed tomorrow.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Do what you young people do
to unwind.
Take a joyride in your jalopy.
Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick.
Go!
Okay, amigos, one teensy drink
to help Amy relax.
Hear, hear!
I guess I'm still kind of nervous.
One more teensy drink
to help Amy relax.
Still a little nervous?
She's a nervous wreck!
Well, I may not have a man,
but at least I've got you,
poopsie-doodle.
It's time you and I had a talk.
A talk?
You can't break up with me.
You're my pet.
As much as I enjoy being the object
of your misplaced affections,
I am also a highly sophisticated being
who longs for intelligent conversation.
Is shnookums
not feeling "shtimuwated"?
An understatement to say the least.
It's time you treated me with respect.
If you want to be treated
like a fellow crew member, fine,
but no more purse rides
and no more dressing you up
in your cute little sailor suit.
I keep telling you,
that's my real naval uniform.
- Your place or mine?
- Both.
But first, this place.
Room for one more?
I thought I set you for 7:15.
Sorry.
I hooked up with Bender last night.
Dude was all over my snooze button.
But my doctoral exam
is in ten minutes,
on Mars!
Kif, did you yack on the floor?
Yes, I did.
Where's your candidate?
I have a long list of students
to humiliate today.
- You're late, Miss Wong.
- Oh, God,
this is like one
of those nightmares.
Here, take my lab coat.
Allow me to introduce
your examining committee
in descending order of grumpiness.
Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
Wernstrom.
Downtown Professor
of applied physics:
Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate.
I see by your curriculum vitae
that you're a sagittarius.
And Professor
Fischerpreis Schpeeknschpell.
The cow says...
He proved that 50 years ago,
and he's been coasting on it
ever since.
I am the esteemed
Professor Morris Katz,
and you are wasting my time.
Proceed.
- Imagine, if you will...
- Oh, God.
A gigantic spherical generator,
one that could provide
unlimited energy
because it's essentially
in perpetual motion.
Young lady, have you been drinking?
Yes, but that's not revelant.
I'm talking about Earth.
Earth's the Generator.
Suppose this basketball
is the whole world.
To many young men
in the inner city, it is.
As it spins, it's producing
an enormous magnetic field.
If we could use that field
to generate electric current,
we could actually harness
the Earth's rotational ener...
ener... kerchoo!
Tapping the Earth's ener-kerchoo.
Go on.
Sorry, I'm super allergic to cats.
Professor Katz, would you mind?
Miss wong, I mind everything.
You just need to polarize
the earth's core with a huge...
Static charge...
By ratcheting superconductive
wire down into...
Sorry.
Enough.
The committee members
will now vote yay or nay.
- Nay.
- Nay.
Hell, nay.
The horse says: "doctorate denied."
It's okay, Amy.
I don't have a fancy degree either,
but today I'm a prominent boy
in the package delivery field.
Now that I am a full
and equal member of the crew,
I pledge my loyalty,
my perspicacity,
and dare I say it, my friendship.
Leela, muzzle that skunk.
We can't stop a meeting
for some cute, fuzzy, little...
Look, a kitty cat.
You again?
Get away,
you mangy ball of histamines!
You leave kitty cat alone.
People, please,
I'm trying to run a business,
- so I get to hold kitty.
- No, me.
Its anus looks like an asterisk.
Captain Fuzzy Toes
reporting for duty...
I mean, cutie.
My best friend died in that uniform.
I hate that cat!
If I had a spray bottle,
I'd give him such a spritzing.
I'll tell you one thing...
Nothing acts that cute
without some ulterior motive.
You want your dipey changed?
We'll have to watch its every move.
Powder, please.
Here's my new theory:
That is one adorable cat.
I guess I was just jealous.
I do miss being Leela's shnookums.
I'm going to apologize
and hope for a pity pet.
Yes, my lord.
Amy and Nibbler
are a "tewwible thweat."
They must be spayed
and neutered, "wespectivewy."
The cat is evil.
We have proof.
It was summoning a saucer.
Of course it wanted a saucer,
you idiot...
A saucer of "dewicious cweam."
You fool,
this isn't about the cream.
It's pwonounced "cweam."
I'm petting mine down to the bone.
Just stwoke its fwuffy fur.
Scwatch its fwubby chin.
Fweeble its fwooby pwow.
Pet it, pet it...
What do cats need
with that much yarn and cobalt?
They're doing something downstairs.
We've got to find out what.
Where do you think
you're going, no-cat?
The basement.
I left the air-hockey table on.
Without a cat,
you ain't going nowhere.
Can you tell us
what's going on down there?
We're certainly not building
something sinister,
if that's what you're implying.
Come on, Bender,
something sinister won't build itself.
Professor Katz's last name is Katz.
Do you think he has something to do
with these cats?
The conclusion is as inescapable
as it is moronic.
I say we pay him a visit,
and if he won't talk to us,
he'll talk to Smith & Wesson.
Or perhaps Consolidated Head Melter.
Professor Katz, we want answers.
I warn you,
if I have to get cute,
it's gonna get ugly.
He's dead!
Wait.
What are these strings on his lap?
What the...?
He isn't dead.
He's one
of those dog-operated puppets
that's been adapted
for use by a cat!
So I had my doctorate denied
by that fuzz ball?
Bad kitty!
They built the planetary ratchet
from my thesis!
Look what the me dragged in.
- You can talk!
- You can talk?
How ironic!
Two hyper-intelligent beings both
pretending to be simple house pets.
Say, do you know Obliteron?
He pretends to be a hamster, but...
That's really great. Could you please
tell us what's going on?
What? Right.
You see, my associates and I
are from the ninth planet
of the star you call Thuban.
Long ago, life there was ideal.
<i>The sun provided plenty of warm,
dozy light.</i>
<i>The chicken-salmon roamed free.</i>
<i>Yet,</i>
<i>disaster loomed.</i>
<i>Our planet's rotation
was gradually slowing.</i>
<i>At first, it seemed beneficial.</i>
<i>Long dark nights for sleeping,</i>
<i>long sunny days for sleeping.</i>
<i>But then, it got too hot.</i>
<i>And too cold.</i>
<i>Our top scientists went to work.</i>
<i>At last, they located a planet
with the necessary orientation</i>
<i>and magnetic field
to harness its rotational energy.</i>
Earth!
Indubitably. Although we call it
blue-blue shiny ball.
<i>In the area now known as Egypt,</i>
<i>my people constructed a giant,
semi-octahedral antenna</i>
<i>to beam earth's rotational energy
to Thuban.</i>
The great pyramid at Giza!
<i>The Egyptians viewed us as gods,</i>
<i>but ironically,
that was our downfall.</i>
<i>They pampered us
with feasts most fancy</i>
<i>and vittles most tender.</i>
<i>We grew fat and domesticated.</i>
Thousands of years passed,
<i>and our home world
was nearing total destruction.</i>
Shut up!
But the technology
to save our planet was lost.
Lost, that is, until I heard you speak
at Mars University.
So you called my thesis
a fat sack of barf,
and then you stole it?
Welcome to Academia.
He intends to siphon off
earth's rotational energy!
Earth will come to a stop, and...
Half of you will cook,
and half of you will freeze.
Earth will be one big McDLT.
We just got that commercial
last year.
Yeah, smartly paws?
You may have built the ratchet,
but you can't reach the core
without 4,000 miles
of superconducting wire.
The ball of yarn!
Quite.
Even so,
you'd still need
a tremendously powerful static charge
to trigger the process.
Ever had a cat rub up against you?
If you're propositioning me,
I'm not interested.
I'm talking about
the charge generated
when 50,000 felines
rub against a single surface.
Soon the world will come to a stop,
and there's nothing you can do
to stop it.
The stopping of the world, that is.
It's unstoppable.
Excuse me.
The Earth is coming to a stop!
Keep your eyes on the kitties
and push!
These space cats
seem to be employing some form
of hypnotic hyper-cuteness.
Two can play at that game.
And one of them is me.
Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle?
Mr. Winkles, Smudge-smudge.
Quick, dance with each other!
Damn, they are good.
We're coming to a full stop.
All cats, to your posts!
Catastrophic beach party...
Scene one.
Cue disaster effects and... action!
Cut!
That extra looked at the camera.
We'll have to do it again.
And now to transfer
your planet's rotational energy
to my home world.
Well, now,
this calls for a celebration.
What's all this cat hair
on my sweater?
Why am I full of sand?
And Tootsie Rolls?
You were all under the spell
of those obnoxious space cats!
Enjoy being broiled alive
by the sun,
and also the dead bird
we've left in your slipper.
Quickly! If we turn the ratchet
the other way,
perhaps we can restart the earth!
It won't turn.
- Push harder, Bender!
- I can't!
You should have called my cousin,
Turner.
It's hopeless.
Even in theory,
the device can only apply force
in one direction.
Can someone open a window?
It's getting a little warm in here.
Is that better?
Shmeezus, it's hot!
Why'd I have to invent
that awful device?
Technology isn't intrinsically
good or evil.
It's how it's used.
Like the death ray.
Maybe you're right.
I guess science
has to keep pushing forward
with the hope that...
That's it!
Pushing forward!
Professor,
I know how to restart the earth!
You can't suddenly know something
by assembling a committee of words.
That's it!
I'll assemble your committee!
The ratchet won't turn backwards,
but what
if we kept pushing it forward?
Earth would start turning again!
Yes... the wrong direction!
So?
Gentlemen,
ladies,
let's get this globe trotting.
It's working!
Just a little faster!
But we're plotzing here!
Then look at Nibbler!
On the whole,
earth society is worthless.
But they do have these things
called antique rugs
that are great for peeing on.
Good show.
And though the world is now spinning
in the wrong direction,
it's good enough.
Well done, Amy.
I'm honored to begrudgingly present
with your PHD.
In applied physics.
Also, some kind
of sportsmanship award
I had in my glove compartment.
I'm finally done with school!
How's the job market?
Ruff.
Congratulations, Dr. Wong!
Permission to come aboard?
Granted, shnookums.
You've got a bright future, Amy.
As sure as the Sun sets in the east.
