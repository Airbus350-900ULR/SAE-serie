Do you know what happens next?
Da.
Where are you
shipping the bodies?
Detroit.
Who is taking possession?
Van Sciver.
Marcus Van Sciver.
Okay, you can go.
You kidding, yes ?
Yes.
Blade The Series - 101 - Pilot
You're lost ?
These streets are dangerous.
I can take care of myself.
Oh, really ?
And, uh,
these can take care of you.
Well, bring them him.
Not you.
We're gonna go
for a little ride.
Where are we ?
Friend of mine's.
- What is this place ?
- You're gonna love it, sweetheart.
Are you robbing me, asshole ?
Just wait here a
second, beautiful.
What the hell is in there ?
Don't worry about it.
It's easier if you don't struggle,
honey. 50 bucks ? Cheap Whore !
It's a disaster.
Just the way you like it.
Barred windows. Plenty of space.
And, if we get bored,
there's a ping pong
table in the back.
I know how much
you love ping pong.
Come on !
I've taken you to a half of dozen sites
sealed as tight as a frog's ass, you
pissed on every one of them.
You said we have to move fast.
We do.
Well then pick a place and throw
down your damn sleeping bag.
Set up shop.
Thanks Marcus.
You don't know how
much this means to me.
You deserve this, Zack.
You've been such a good boy !
It's right. But it's,
like, the last time you
ever really feel pain ?
There's only
pleasure I had baby.
- Hey Marcus. Is there anything I should know ?
- Get out of the car.
Is there a... speech I need to
say or a... prayer or something ?
Nobody wants a prayer.
We are big on unity, Zack, and trust
is an important part of that unity.
That's why we brought in here.
The House of Chthon has
a lot of locked doors.
Doors meant to hold my secrets.
You've been picking through
a lot of keyholes, Zack.
- Too many.
- Wait, wait !
She's home. Oh, my baby girl's home !
I missed you!
I'm back.
It's great to have you back.
It's great to be back.
I heard about the
action you saw.
You know, I run that support
group up in Pyac if you need it.
How about that beer ?
Works too ! For a while.
You should eat something.
I will in a little while.
Where is Zack ?
He was arrested last week.
Listen.
I'm thinking we should all sit down,
have a nice long talk
- before he winds up in prison.
- Waste of time.
Mum ! He's not a bad guy!
He's just a little lost !
- Why do you always defend him ?
- Because nobody else will !
Look, why don't we just cool
down here and think about...
Oh, it's probably
Zack right now.
Is this the family of Zack Starr ?
- Yes.
Sorry, but there's
been a shooting.
I know this is very difficult for you,
Miss Starr.
That's my brother.
Twin brother, eh ?
Yeah.
Harsh.
What is that ?
Oh, that, it's a gang sign,
I've seen it around.
He wasn't in a gang.
Yeah? When was the
last time you saw him?
Two years ago.
A lot can change in two years.
Zack wasn't in a gang !
We are doing everything we can
to find out who do this. Hey !
So, well, uh, I'll uh,
I'll be in touch.
Bryan Boone.
Call me, I mean if you need any help.
3 men may be tied to the east side
but an identified man fired an
assault riffle.
This  continues away the violence that
hits the city over the last two months.
The mayor called it a priority
of the city earlier this morning
after the body of Zack Starr, an
alleged gang member, was discovered
by the Detroit river.
This is the tenth gang-related
death in the last three weeks.
Authorities are asking anyone for
information to please come forward.
Back to you Bill.
Have you finished ?
Yeah, I'm finished.
Security, media feeds
and infrared are on.
Sun's down.
Time to make some new friends.
Huh Blade.
Try to do this quietly.
Yeah, that's my M.O..
How does it feel ?
Hum, that hurts.
Good tattoo always does.
It's not a buttlerfly or a key
or some 5-minute shit like that.
Doesn't count if you don't need
the needle for at least an hour.
How long have you been
working for Van Sciver ?
Tell me!
Tell me what I want to know !
Get him off !
What  do you wanna know?
Tell me, I'll tell you.
What the hell ?
I told you I'd talk.
Sorry, I didn't hear.
You've reached Detective Bryan Booin
robbery and homicide, I'm not avalaible
right now,
but if it's an emergency hang up, then
dial 911. Otherwise leave a message
after the tone.
Zack...
Hey  !
Come on in.
Oh god !
No, no, no, no, I gotta go.
I'm sorry about that, hello.
I left some messages.
And you are uh ?
Krista Starr.
Krista St...
Oh right, the dealer's sister.
My brother wasn't a drug
dealer or a gang member.
Ok, that took place...
Here we go. The, the docks right ?
I was just to his appartment and there
was this man there going through
his stuff.
What did he looked like ?
Black, dressed in black.
Oh black, that narrows it down.
But he could be a suspect
or he can know something.
- Can I see my brother's file ?
- No.
Maybe I could help,
I was a sergent in the Army.
Yeah, this ain't the army.
Listen, sweetheart.
At the end of the day, your brother got
caught up and somebody shot him, okay ?
Got in over his head, he pissed off the
wrong people just like every single one
of these guys.
My brother isn't like every
single one of these guys.
Look, people like this, all they end up
doing is taking up file space, you
understand ?
Yeah, I understand.
Have a nice day.
Boone. Ah, yeah !
- Take it easy, pal!
- Hey pancho! Shut that guy up!
Son of a bitch.
What ? I got hungry too.
I need those inhalers.
I'm working on it.
Work... faster.
Dude, most of ??? is destroyed.
The serum that keeps the thirst is
easy to replicate but inhalers work on a
completely different system.
You see,
they allow you to generate hemoglobine.
Humains have genes that develop
proteins, but vampires have disabled
links between them.
These inhalers help diffuse...
Figure it out !
You're supposed to
be the smart one.
Yeah, I'm the
good-looking one too.
Got any leads on what
Marcus is up to ?
I cracked open a dozen
families last night.
If they knew what he was realy
doing in Detroit. So would I.
Well, can't hide forever.
He is Detroit's
great white hope.
The guy started some kind of
Renaissance movement two years ago.
Restored a dozen
buildings from late 1800s,
preached about the
historical value of the city
??? his way to in the future,
blah blah blah.
It's only a matter of time before
he shows his smug little face.
And when he does,
he'll be surrounded by the press.
He'll be hard to get close to.
And you don't exactly blend in.
Damn.
- Danny Milano ?
- Yeah.
Do I know you ?
I'm Zack's sister.
Don't know him.
He's the guy you got
arrested with last week.
I don't know who you think I am.
I'm not. I'm not.
Did you kill my brother ?
No, no, no freaking way.
Why would I wanna kill Zack ?
Memory coming back ?
All right, yeah. He lived a
street from me. We hung around.
Who wanted him dead ?
I don't know. People disappear
around here all the time.
What is that ?
Gang sign ?
It's just a tatoo.
Of what ?
Psycho bitch!
Yeah, hey.
Zack's sister showed up.
I think we got a problem.
Yes ?
Professor Melvin Caylo ?
Who are you ?
What is this ?
Let me see.
Hello ?
Let me see your wrist.
- What ?
- Let me see them !
And the neck. The neck !
You didn't use it, did you ?
Use it ?
The hash. It's found its
way under the streets now.
With the rest of the drugs.
Inhale enough of it, it will give you
the abilities of the omines nocturni.
It is for an hour or two.
Though the sad effects. The...
The thirst that comes with it.
Most end up chewing
their own fingers off.
The omines nocturni?
Vampires.  This is vampire hash.
It's quite expensive too.
This vial is at least
a thousand dollars.
Ten if it comes
from a pure blood.
And I supposed next you're gonna
to tell me that werewolves exist.
My colleague Mock's
area of expertise.
Really ?
What do you think this means ?
This brand's familiar,
it's dedicated to the House of Chthon.
Humans who ???
their lives or their culture.
Hoping to be changed some day.
They're everywhere you see, the police,
the governement, everywhere.
Here.
Take this and flush
it down the toilet.
But I read you were
searching for proof.
I have plenty of that.
Proof.
Hum, thank you for your time.
Wait ! Come back !
God. What a hell of a day!
You okay ?
Hello ?
Hello ?
Hey !
Jesus !
Krista.
Krista.
Krista.
I know who killed your brother.
Here. Hurry !
Hello ?
You wanna know what happen to
your brother ? The wannabe.
He is now meat...
just like you.
Holly shit !
- Those... are...
- Were.
... vampires !
And what does that make you ?
Something else.
What does that mean ?
- Oh, god! What is that smell ?
- Garlic.
They don't like it either.
This is impossible.
There's a whole other world
underneath this one, Krista.
Why is it everybody
know my name ?
Do yourself a favor.
Get out of the city !
Forget everything
you saw here tonight.
Yeah, right ! I can't just forget
about this. I mean, I just...
Hey !
Vampires exist, young lady.
But most people don't
see the dangers.
So, who the hell is Blade ?
My favorite fascination.
His parents were Robert
and Vanessa Brooks.
They lived in Detroit.
Vanessa was nine months pregnant the
night she was attacked, bitten, left
for dead.
Robert found her, struggling to survive
for the sake of her unborn child outside
of their apartment.
He rushed her into the hospital where
their son was delivered by C-section.
Robert named him Eric.
The boy aged
relatively normally.
But he wasn't normal.
Yeah, kind of figured it that.
Eric went through
genetic changes at birth.
He was born a different
kind of vampire. ???
He has all of their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.
Ah... except of the thirst.
The thirst is what controls
all omines nocturni.
And no one can fight it.
Except for Blade.
His father...
kept Blade secret.
He provided fresh blood for him for the
ten first years of his life. Don't ask
me how.
Until he couldn't
handle it anymore.
And Blade was loose
out on the streets.
Until a friend of mine, Abraham
Whistler found him and took him in.
So we saved Blade from
drinking the blood of animals,
others... clone suppliers
like the House of Lychan.
But I know the truth,
he  lives off a synthetic serum.
Where can I find him ?
Well, I will tell you,
he hasn't stayed in
one place very long.
Here uh,
the only address he ever had.
How can you see
with those things ?
What are you doing here ?
You were following me.
You should have left !
You've seen them in the flesh.
You've been seen all ???
after you.
You know who killed my brother.
He was one of them.
Let it go !
Help me take out
these bastards !
Help you?
I'm going after them,
with or without you.
Silver bullet.
Mmh. Doesn't work on me.
But I bet it hurts
like a son of a bitch.
Blade ?
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead ?
I'm not talking to you.
What ?
News... Van Sciver finished
restoring some art gallery last week.
Tonight there's a big party and
our boy's making an appearence.
Good.
Good ?
Who are you talking to, man?
Where are you ?
No, no. Dude, that is Zack's sister.
Do not get her involved.
I'll hold this,
you have a job to do.
- You're listening to me ?
- No, no, Blade. Damn !
Test subject, G1139,
baseline trial on batch 97G.
Beginning vaccine
injection, now.
Stand by for Stage
1 confirmation.
Introduction of Stage
1 garlic extract now.
Stage 1 failure.
Moving on to batch 98G.
New UV blade is not working.
My stuff always works.
Isn't all of this a
little elaborate ?
He likes the pretty lights.
What is this ?
The fat lady.
Oh, the fat lady.
Ultrasonic brain scrambler.
Finally, something I recognize.
Kind of.
Customized PDW.
We call it a shotgun.
One taste of liquid garlic chamber from
that monster sends any vampire in
anaphylactic shock.
Their skin ruptures,
their blood evaporates.
I know.
I saw in action already.
So, what about crosses
and holy water ?
They don't do anything.
You don't need this.
Why not ?
Here, this is a transponder.
To track it anywhere
in the city.
I see, you want me to carry it.
We want someone else too.
Marcus Van Sciver is a player
in the House of Chthon.
The largest vampire
colony in North America.
And tonight you'll be parading
around the Van Sciver house gallery.
So take him out.
I ash Van Sciver.
There is a dozen other vampires
to step up and take his place.
So take them out too.
If we can track him,
he can lead us to the House of Chthon.
If we play this cool,
if we have a little patience,
we can find out what they're up to,
what their operations are.
You take this seriously.
There's no other
way to take it.
A big party.
Excuse me.
This gallery hasn't opened
its doors since 1978.
How does it feel to be a part of another
revitalized institution, Mr Van
Sciver ?
I'm just doing my best to keep
this city alive. Thank you.
There's our girl.
Of course, Chief Edwards.
We always look after our friends.
Dr Dideo.
Fire chief, councilman.
That's the man right there.
It's like stepping
back in time.
Exactly.
She's gonna do it !
This building,
none would have been possible if it
wasn't for the efforts of ten coming up
pioneers in the automotive industry.
Come on.
I am simply...
following the legacy they left.
Oh, don't be so modest.
They say you're the man
who's gonna save Detroit.
Some do.
Gentlemen excuse me. Fritz.
Gentlemen.
I believe we are all to quick to
forget our past. Did you know ?
The average age of building in United
States is less than 30 years old.
Didn't know that.
Take this city, it's been around
since the 18th century and yet,
if  you ask somebody to point out
a prominent historical landmark,
they probably aim for
the Joe Louis Arena.
You see the past has been torn down and
replaced by something that in a short
matter of time
will also be torn
down and replaced.
It's a wasteful cycle.
There's only one thing this country
values when it comes to old age.
So, try to recapture the past ?
Just try not to forget it.
Me either.
So tell me about you.
So much to tell.
Well, you could just
start with a name.
Katherine.
Katherine ?
Now you seem to me to be more like a...
Krista !
Man, I told you !
You look familiar.
Like someone I once knew.
There was this young man,
his name was... Zack Starr.
And he wasn't particularly
bright or assertive.
But he was desperate.
Desperate for some sort
of control of his life.
Let go.
People like him are always
taking never giving,
draining on the
people around him.
Sucking a life from them.
Honestly,
he's better off.
Or at least the world is.
Screw this.
Where is she going ?
What the hell is she doing ?
I'm gonna kill her !
Excuse me, Mr Van Sciver.
It's okay.
She wanted me to give you this.
Who ?
The woman you were talking to.
Hello, Krista.
I know what you are.
You're watching me,
aren't you ?
Through a ten power scope attached to
the top of a matched grade sniper rifle.
Wow, it sounds impressive.
You're allergic to garlic so,
let's stay away
from the gaspacho.
I did, thank you.
There you are.
Tell me more.
Sunlight can burn your skin.
It will turn you into ash.
and I've got a silver bullet ready to
blow that stupid smile right of
your face.
You killed my brother.
Yes, yes I did.
If you knew who I was,
why mess with me like that ?
Because it's my nature.
You're everything your brother wasn't,
aren't you ?
A success where
he was a failure.
Bright... where he was dimmed.
Shut up !
Oh come on, Krista,
take the shot !
I don't care how
fast vampires are.
You can't dodge with a bullet moving
2000 meters per second and trust me,
I'm a hell of a good shot.
What happened ?
She screwed up.
I'm impressed, Krista.
I hope you still are when I'm
shoving a stake up your ass !
I killed a lot of people.
But your brother,
that wasn't out of pleasure.
I really did like him.
But he was looking around of
things he wasn't supposed to.
Being too curious.
You on the other hand,
might just work.
What you're gonna do ?
Bite me ?
Bite you...
That's for savages.
In truth, it's not the most
reliable form of transmission.
No. Here is the
House of Chthon.
We're people civilized.
You need permission Marcus.
Not this time, no.
Just let me kill
her and end it.
Hush, Chase.
Stay the hell away from me !
Oh I know, you're scared.
You think of us as sociopaths that
just walked out of a nightmare.
But this is an honor, Krista.
Trust me.
There are severe restrictions based on
the number of humans we're allowed
to turn.
We don't wanna attract unwanted
attention or put a strain on our
food soures.
We survive by living
in the shadows.
???
It's okay to fight.
It's only natural.
But you will think so much better,
so much clearer
once you've been
through the change.
Now Krista,
all you have to do is die.
Wake up !
Zack ?
He can't catch me, catch me...
Ah ah ah !
Over there,
I want to tell you something.
Zack.
Krista, all you
have to do is die.
You understand ?
Please, kill me. Kill me!
Hello, Krista.
Welcome to the family.
You can't stop looking.
Body was delivered at the city morgue
last night at 2 a.m. Vanished about 3.
Has she been turned?
Blade, we can't cure her.
And the thirst is going to take over
by the time the sun rises tomorrow.
You find her, you got to stake her.
Just like always.
The serum ?
You mean the chance
of that working ?
Are what ?
Slim, man !
You pump her full of it before sunrise,
she might get a clear head for a
few hours.
But if she feeds off a fresh kill
before, then who the hell knows !
And finding her is
still a problem.
Krista left a loose end out there.
I'm gonna tie it up.
I would have warned you.
But there is something to be said
for learning from experience.
You've been asleep all day.
- I feel...
- Alive ?
Yeah.
Those shoes, put them on.
You see Krista,
the so-called living.
The ones growing
obese and passive.
Oblivious to the
true layers of life.
They are the ones you are dead.
The dull senses have no abilities to
unlock the real beauty of this world.
Unlike us.
You will learn, soon enough,
everything has so many
more facets of pleasure.
Music, food, sex.
Your rebirth is here.
Your grihalt.
Grihalt?
In our language, it means someone
who has achieved true life.
And as your sponsor,
it's my privilege to teach it to you.
And to introduce
you to our culture.
I saw you.
And I saw my brother.
The images you witnessed
are part of your ADE.
And after that experience triggered by
the genetic memories of your sponsor.
And your own synapses,
they rebuilt your cognitive functions.
The visions you witnessed
are sacred, Krista.
And must only be shared with
someone you really trust.
Don't touch me.
What did you do to me ?
What did you do ?
I saved you.
Take her with you.
This is a mistake.
What is ? Her ?
Yes, Marcus.
And when you were
turned, Chase?
Everyone starts somewhere.
And some...
start a lot lower in
life than Krista Starr.
You will take her on a ride along.
And you will teach her.
And you will dress her.
When the board finds out
what you've been doing.
Don't question me, Chase!
Ever !
I told the sister
everything I know.
You can't do that !
You can't do that... I'm protected.
Not from me.
If someone disappears down here,
who knows where they go ?
I don't know.
Give me a name, Danny.
He's a cop, Boone. He got the
charges on Zack and I dropped.
You gotta understand
why we do this man.
We wanna be like you.
Strong, fast. And immortality, man.
I'm gonna live for freaking ever.
No, you won't.
Can you see it ?
Krista ?
See what ?
Relax your eyes.
Pull your focus back.
Look !
I see something.
They can only be read in
the ultraviolet spectrum.
The House of Chthon's glyph.
It means it's ours.
Ours ?
One of the places we recruit.
We also have save houses throughout the
city where fresh blood is delivered.
If you're out and dawn approaches,
you go.
But if you see the House of
Lychan glyph, stay away.
The thirst, it hurts.
Yes.
You'll drink.
Soon enough.
Fritz, go.
Blade, the
transponder's online.
I smell it.
Me too.
Drink.
Slowly, take it all in slowly.
When did that happen to you ?
When did you become grihalt?
Marcus told you that,
didn't he ?
It's his favorite word.
He says the same
speech to all of them.
All of who ?
The new born. But with the strict
rules we live by, the enemies outside,
most of them don't last a year.
Did Marcus change you ?
No. My husband did.
And lived to regret it.
He still does.
Hey !
You should be careful out there, honey.
These streets are dangerous.
There a bed inside ?
You wouldn't believe what's inside.
You are just a little snack thing, huh?
Jesus.
I thought I told you my pets
are on the strict diet.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Don't pull that Dracula shit, sneaking
up on people, I almost crap myself.
You've been
overfeeding them again.
And for what ?
A few dirty twenties ?
I've got something for you.
Shit !
Blade.
Fat lady's early.
Burn her.
I told you too many times.
All right, all right,
I'll stay away ok ?
You got to help me now.
If I was like you, I mean I could
do some much more. Come on !
Make me Marcus.
Make you?
I've put up with your desobedience
and carelessness long enough.
Come on man ! I...
Wait a minute, you turned her ?
That slacker sister !
It's my turn, my...
There is no room for someone
like you in my inner circle.
It's time to cut bait.
And unfortunately for you,
you're the only person
I know she hates.
You'll make it easy for her.
Now Krista,
it's time for your fist kill.
That's enough!
Live him be.
This is something she
must do on her own.
No...
Come along,
the new vaccine is ready.
Blade's here.
Deal with it.
Marcus, give me
the new vaccine.
No.
He is here.
Let me serve you.
Krista !
You can still fight it.
It's been fun.
His shit always works my ass !
Shen?
- Shen ? Shen ?
- I'm here, I'm here !
Shen, something's wrong.
Shen, make the fat
lady sing now !
I hope your earplugs are in,
buddy, here we go !
Fritz ? That's enough.
You're my new favorite.
You've proven our success.
Shit !
Fat lady is recharging.
She's got one more hit in her.
Give me one sec to get
her to do it again.
She is singing again !
Blade, gotta juice. Coming in.
Shen, don't !
Sorry brother.
Go, goddamn it !
What did you do ?
This stuff doesn't work,
but I found you, didn't I ?
Up. There you go, big guy.
Next time I offer
backup you take it.
Good day, Fritz.
You did well, Krista.
How's Chase ?
She'll be fine.
Marcus, the ??? would like a
few words with you, privately.
Of course.
Excuse me.
Marcus ?
Yes.
The visions I saw
when I was changed.
The ones with my brother,
what did they mean ?
What did you see ?
Him and I,
a long time ago as kids in this
story book village we used to go to.
Zach wanted me to chase him.
He was trying to
show you something.
What should I do ?
What you have been, follow him.
My stuff always works.
Not this time !
Where did you hit him ?
Then it's something else.
So what the hell are
they doing here ?
What did you do to me ?
I injected you with a serum,
to get you thinking straight.
Krista, Krista !
That cop,
I ripped his throat out.
I killed him.
Listen,
if you take this
serum twice a day,
it might keep the
thirst under control.
Look, you wanted in,
and you're in.
In as far as you can go.
You're one of them.
So are you.
You can learn so much.
I can work with you.
Just like I worked
with your brother.
My brother ?
Zack worked for you ?
Yes. He was my contact here.
- Oh my god, you got him killed.
- No, Marcus did.
But Marcus was wrong about him.
He was a good man.
Give me the serum.
I got to get back.
What do you think ?
Could go either away.
No !!!
Next time on Blade.
I need information on Fritz.
Like what ?
He's not your every vampire.
I'm beginning to
think you like this.
You're sure the
vaccine is stable ?
Yes, it's stable.
Then perhaps a new
day has dawned.
No !!!
Let's finish this.
Transcript : Rijad
Do you know what happens next?
Da.
Where are you
shipping the bodies?
Detroit.
Who is taking possession?
Van Sciver.
Marcus Van Sciver.
Okay, you can go.
You kidding, yes?
Yes.
Blade The Series - 101- Pilot
You're lost?
These streets are dangerous.
I can take care of myself.
Oh, really?
And, uh,
these can take care of you.
Well, bring them him.
Not you.
We're gonna go
for a little ride.
Where are we?
Friend of mine's.
- What is this place?
- You're gonna love it, sweetheart.
Are you robbing me, asshole?
Just wait here a
second, beautiful.
What the hell is in there?
Don't worry about it.
It's easier if you don't struggle,
honey. 50 bucks? Cheap Whore!
It's a disaster.
Just the way you like it.
Barred windows. Plenty of space.
And, if we get bored,
there's a ping pong
table in the back.
I know how much
you love ping pong.
Come on! I've taken you to a half of dozen
sites sealed as tight as a frog's ass,
you pissed on every one of them.
You said we have to move fast.
We do.
Well then pick a place and throw
down your damn sleeping bag.
Set up shop.
Thanks Marcus.
You don't know how
much this means to me.
You deserve this, Zack.
You've been such a good boy!
It's right. But it's,
like, the last time you
ever really feel pain?
There's only
pleasure I had baby.
Hey Marcus. Is there anything I should know?
Get out of the car.
Is there a... speech I need to
say or a... prayer or something?
Nobody wants a prayer.
We are big on unity, Zack, and trust
is an important part of that unity.
That's why we brought in here.
The House of Chthon has
a lot of locked doors.
Doors meant to hold my secrets.
You've been picking through
a lot of keyholes, Zack.
- Too many.
- Wait, wait!
She's home. Oh, my baby girl's home!
I missed you!
I'm back.
It's great to have you back.
It's great to be back.
I heard about the
action you saw.
You know, I run that support
group up in Pyac if you need it.
How about that beer?
Works too! For a while.
You should eat something.
I will in a little while.
Where is Zack?
He was arrested last week.
Listen.
I'm thinking we should all sit down,
have a nice long talk
- before he winds up in prison.
- Waste of time.
Mum! He's not a bad guy!
He's just a little lost!
- Why do you always defend him?
- Because nobody else will!
Look, why don't we just cool
down here and think about...
Oh, it's probably
Zack right now.
Is this the family of Zack Starr?
- Yes.
Sorry, but there's
been a shooting.
I know this is very difficult for you,
Miss Starr.
That's my brother.
Twin brother, eh?
Yeah.
Harsh.
What is that?
Oh, that, it's a gang sign,
I've seen it around.
He wasn't in a gang.
Yeah? When was the
last time you saw him?
Two years ago.
A lot can change in two years.
Zack wasn't in a gang!
We are doing everything we can
to find out who do this. Hey!
So, well, uh, I'll uh,
I'll be in touch.
Bryan Boone.
Call me, I mean if you need any help.
3  men may be tied to the east side but
an identified man fired an assault riffle.
This continues away the violence that
hits the city over the last two months.
The mayor called it a priority
of the city earlier this morning...
after the body of Zack Starr,
an alleged gang member,
was discovered by the Detroit river.
This is the tenth gang-related
death in the last three weeks.
Authorities are asking anyone for
information to please come forward.
Back to you Bill.
Have you finished?
Yeah, I'm finished.
Security, media feeds
and infrared are on.
Sun's down.
Time to make some new friends.
Huh Blade.
Try to do this quietly.
Yeah, that's my M.O..
How does it feel?
Hum, that hurts.
Good tattoo always does.
It's not a buttlerfly or a key
or some 5-minute shit like that.
Doesn't count if you don't need
the needle for at least an hour.
How long have you been
working for Van Sciver?
Tell  me!
Tell me what I want to know!
Get him off!
What do you wanna know?
Tell me, I'll tell you.
What the hell?
I told you I'd talk.
Sorry, I didn't hear.
You've reached Detective Bryan Booin robbery
and homicide, I'm not avalaible right now,
but  if it's an emergency hang up,
then dial 911.
Otherwise leave a message after the tone.
Zack...
Hey!
Come on in.
Oh god!
No, no, no, no, I gotta go.
I'm sorry about that, hello.
I left some messages.
And you are uh?
Krista Starr.
Krista St...
Oh right, the dealer's sister.
My brother wasn't a drug
dealer or a gang member.
Ok, that took place...
Here we go. The, the docks right?
I was just to his appartment and there
was this man there going through his stuff.
What did he looked like?
Black, dressed in black.
Oh black, that narrows it down.
But he could be a suspect
or he can know something.
- Can I see my brother's file?
- No.
Maybe I could help,
I was a sergent in the Army.
Yeah, this ain't the army.
Listen, sweetheart.
At the end of the day, your brother got
caught up and somebody shot him, okay?
Got in over his head, hepissed off
the wrong people...
just like every single one of these guys.
My brother isn't like every
single one of these guys.
Look, people like this,
all they end up doing...
is taking up file space, you understand?
Yeah, I understand.
Have a nice day.
Boone. Ah, yeah!
- Take it easy, pal!
- Hey pancho! Shut that guy up!
Son of a bitch.
What? I got hungry too.
I need those inhalers.
I'm working on it.
Work... faster.
Dude, most of? is destroyed.
The serum that keeps the thirst
is easy to replicate...
but inhalers work on a completely
different system.
You see,
they allow you to generate hemoglobine.
Humains have genes that develop proteins,
but vampires have disabled links
between them.
These inhalers help diffuse...
Figure it out!
You're supposed to
be the smart one.
Yeah, I'm the
good-looking one too.
Got any leads on what
Marcus is up to?
I cracked open a dozen
families last night.
If they knew what he was realy
doing in Detroit. So would I.
Well, can't hide forever.
He is Detroit's
great white hope.
The guy started some kind of
Renaissance movement two years ago.
Restored a dozen
buildings from late 1800s,
preached about the
historical value of the city...
pass show his way to in the future,
blah blah blah.
It's only a matter of time before
he shows his smug little face.
And when he does,
he'll be surrounded by the press.
He'll be hard to get close to.
And you don't exactly blend in.
Damn.
- Danny Milano?
- Yeah.
Do I know you?
I'm Zack's sister.
Don't know him.
He's the guy you got
arrested with last week.
I don't know who you think I am.
I'm not. I'm not.
Did you kill my brother?
No, no, no freaking way.
Why would I wanna kill Zack?
Memory coming back?
All right, yeah. He lived a
street from me. We hung around.
Who wanted him dead?
I don't know. People disappear
around here all the time.
What is that?
Gang sign?
It's just a tatoo.
Of what?
Psycho bitch!
Yeah, hey.
Zack's sister showed up.
I think we got a problem.
Yes?
Professor Melvin Caylo?
Who are you?
What is this?
Let me see.
Hello?
Let me see your wrist.
- What?
- Let me see them!
And the neck. The neck!
You didn't use it, did you?
Use it?
The hash. It's found its
way under the streets now.
With  the rest of the drugs.
Inhale enough of it, it will give you
the abilities of the omines nocturni.
It is for an hour or two.
Though the sad effects. The...
The thirst that comes with it.
Most end up chewing
their own fingers off.
The omines nocturni?
Vampires. This is vampire hash.
It's quite expensive too.
This vial is at least
a thousand dollars.
Ten if it comes
from a pure blood.
And I supposed next you're gonna
to tell me that werewolves exist.
My colleague Mock's
area of expertise.
Really?
What do you think this means?
This brand's familiar,
it's dedicated to the House of Chthon.
Humans who?
their lives or their culture.
Hoping to be changed some day.
They're everywhere you see, the police,
the governement, everywhere.
Here.
Take this and flush
it down the toilet.
But I read you were
searching for proof.
I have plenty of that.
Proof.
Hum, thank you for your time.
Wait! Come back!
God. What a hell of a day!
You okay?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey!
Jesus!
Krista.
Krista.
Krista.
I know who killed your brother.
Here. Hurry!
Hello?
You wanna know what happen to
your brother? The wannabe.
He is now meat...
just like you.
Holly shit!
- Those... are...
- Were.
...vampires!
And what does that make you?
Something else.
What does that mean?
- Oh, god! What is that smell?
- Garlic.
They don't like it either.
This is impossible.
There's a whole other world
underneath this one, Krista.
Why is it everybody
know my name?
Do yourself a favor.
Get out of the city!
Forget everything
you saw here tonight.
Yeah, right! I can't just forget
about this. I mean, I just...
Hey!
Vampires exist, young lady.
But most people don't
see the dangers.
So, who the hell is Blade?
My favorite fascination.
His parents were Robert
and Vanessa Brooks.
They lived in Detroit.
Vanessa was nine months pregnant the night
she was attacked, bitten, left for dead.
Robert found her, struggling to survive for the
sake of her unborn child outside of their apartment.
He rushed her into the hospital where
their son was delivered by C-section.
Robert named him Eric.
The boy aged
relatively normally.
But he wasn't normal.
Yeah, kind of figured it that.
Eric went through
genetic changes at birth.
He was born a different
kind of vampire.?
He has all of their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.
Ah... except of the thirst.
The thirst is what controls
all omines nocturni.
And no one can fight it.
Except for Blade.
His father...
kept Blade secret.
He  provided fresh blood for him for the ten
first years of his life. Don't ask me how.
Until he couldn't
handle it anymore.
And Blade was loose
out on the streets.
Until a friend of mine, Abraham
Whistler found him and took him in.
So we saved Blade from
drinking the blood of animals,
others... clone suppliers
like the House of Lychan.
But I know the truth,
he lives off a synthetic serum.
Where can I find him?
Well, I will tell you,
he hasn't stayed in
one place very long.
Here uh,
the only address he ever had.
How can you see
with those things?
What are you doing here?
You were following me.
You should have left!
You've seen them in the flesh.
You've been seen all?
after you.
You know who killed my brother.
He was one of them.
Let it go!
Help me take out
these bastards!
Help you?
I'm going after them,
with or without you.
Silver bullet.
Mmh. Doesn't work on me.
But I bet it hurts
like a son of a bitch.
Blade?
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead?
I'm not talking to you.
What?
News... Van Sciver finished
restoring some art gallery last week.
Tonight there's a big party and
our boy's making an appearence.
Good.
Good?
Who are you talking to, man?
Where are you?
No, no. Dude, that is Zack's sister.
Do not get her involved.
I'll hold this,
you have a job to do.
- You're listening to me?
- No, no, Blade. Damn!
Test subject, G1139,
baseline trial on batch 97G.
Beginning vaccine
injection, now.
Stand by for Stage
1 confirmation.
Introduction of Stage
1 garlic extract now.
Stage 1 failure.
Moving on to batch 98G.
New UV blade is not working.
My stuff always works.
Isn't all of this a
little elaborate?
He likes the pretty lights.
What is this?
The fat lady.
Oh, the fat lady.
Ultrasonic brain scrambler.
Finally, something I recognize.
Kind of.
Customized PDW.
We call it a shotgun.
One taste of liquid garlic chamber from that
monster sends any vampire in anaphylactic shock.
Their skin ruptures,
their blood evaporates.
I know.
I saw in action already.
So, what about crosses
and holy water?
They don't do anything.
You don't need this.
Why not?
Here, this is a transponder.
To track it anywhere
in the city.
I see, you want me to carry it.
We want someone else too.
Marcus Van Sciver is a player
in the House of Chthon.
The largest vampire
colony in North America.
And tonight you'll be parading
around the Van Sciver house gallery.
So take him out.
I ash Van Sciver.
There is a dozen other vampires
to step up and take his place.
So take them out too.
If we can track him,
he can lead us to the House of Chthon.
If we play this cool,
if we have a little patience,
we can find out what they're up to,
what their operations are.
You take this seriously.
There's no other
way to take it.
A big party.
Excuse me.
This gallery hasn't opened
its doors since 1978.
How does it feel to be a part of another
revitalized institution, Mr Van Sciver?
I'm just doing my best to keep
this city alive. Thank you.
There's our girl.
Of course, Chief Edwards.
We always look after our friends.
Dr Dideo.
Fire chief, councilman.
That's the man right there.
It's like stepping
back in time.
Exactly.
She's gonna do it!
This building,
none would have been possible if it wasn't for the efforts
of ten coming up pioneers in the automotive industry.
Come on.
I am simply...
following the legacy they left.
Oh, don't be so modest.
They say you're the man
who's gonna save Detroit.
Some  do.
Gentlemen excuse me. Fritz.
Gentlemen.
I believe we are all to quick to
forget our past. Did you know?
The average age of building in United
States is less than 30 years old.
Didn't know that.
Take this city, it's been around
since the 18th century and yet,
if you ask somebody to point out
a prominent historical landmark,
they probably aim for
the Joe Louis Arena.
You see the past has been torn down and replaced
by something that in a short matter of time
will also be torn
down and replaced.
It's a wasteful cycle.
There's only one thing this country
values when it comes to old age.
So, try to recapture the past?
Just try not to forget it.
Me either.
So tell me about you.
So much to tell.
Well, you could just
start with a name.
Katherine.
Katherine?
Now you seem to me to be more like a...
Krista!
Man, I told you!
You look familiar.
Like someone I once knew.
There was this young man,
his name was... Zack Starr.
And he wasn't particularly
bright or assertive.
But he was desperate.
Desperate for some sort
of control of his life.
Let go.
People like him are always
taking never giving,
draining on the
people around him.
Sucking a life from them.
Honestly,
he's better off.
Or at least the world is.
Screw this.
Where is she going?
What the hell is she doing?
I'm gonna kill her!
Excuse me, Mr Van Sciver.
It's okay.
She wanted me to give you this.
Who?
The woman you were talking to.
Hello, Krista.
I know what you are.
You're watching me,
aren't you?
Through a ten power scope attached to
the top of a matched grade sniper rifle.
Wow, it sounds impressive.
You're allergic to garlic so,
let's stay away
from the gaspacho.
I did, thank you.
There you are.
Tell me more.
Sunlight can burn your skin.
It will turn you into ash.
and I've got a silver bullet ready to
blow that stupid smile right of your face.
You killed my brother.
Yes, yes I did.
If you knew who I was,
why mess with me like that?
Because it's my nature.
You're everything your brother wasn't,
aren't you?
A success where
he was a failure.
Bright... where he was dimmed.
Shut up!
Oh come on, Krista,
take the shot!
I don't care how
fast vampires are.
You can't dodge with a bullet moving
2000 meters per second and trust me,
I'm a hell of a good shot.
What happened?
She screwed up.
I'm impressed, Krista.
I hope you still are when I'm
shoving a stake up your ass!
I killed a lot of people.
But your brother,
that wasn't out of pleasure.
I really did like him.
But he was looking around of
things he wasn't supposed to.
Being too curious.
You on the other hand,
might just work.
What you're gonna do?
Bite me?
Bite you...
That's for savages.
In truth, it's not the most
reliable form of transmission.
No. Here is the
House of Chthon.
We're people civilized.
You need permission Marcus.
Not this time, no.
Just let me kill
her and end it.
Hush, Chase.
Stay the hell away from me!
Oh I know, you're scared.
You think of us as sociopaths that
just walked out of a nightmare.
But this is an honor, Krista.
Trust me.
There are severe restrictions based on
the number of humans we're allowed to turn.
We don't wanna attract unwanted attention
or put a strain on our food soures.
We survive by living
in the shadows.
It's okay to fight.
It's only natural.
But you will think so much better,
so much clearer
once you've been
through the change.
Now Krista,
all you have to do is die.
Wake up!
Zack?
He can't catch me, catch me...
Ah ah ah!
Over there,
I want to tell you something.
Zack.
Krista, all you
have to do is die.
You understand?
Please, kill me.
Kill me!
Hello, Krista.
Welcome to the family.
You can't stop looking.
Body was delivered at the city morgue
last night at 2 a. m. Vanished about 3.
Has she been turned?
Blade, we can't cure her.
And the thirst is going to take over
by the time the sun rises tomorrow.
You find her, you got to stake her.
Just like always.
The serum?
You mean the chance
of that working?
Are what?
Slim, man!
You pump her full of it before sunrise,
she might get a clear head for a few hours.
But if she feeds off a fresh kill
before, then who the hell knows!
And finding her is
still a problem.
Krista left a loose end out there.
I'm gonna tie it up.
I would have warned you.
But there is something to be said
for learning from experience.
You've been asleep all day.
- I feel...
- Alive?
Yeah.
Those shoes, put them on.
You see Krista,
the so-called living.
The ones growing
obese and passive.
Oblivious to the
true layers of life.
They are the ones you are dead.
The dull senses have no abilities to
unlock the real beauty of this world.
Unlike us.
You will learn, soon enough,
everything has so many
more facets of pleasure.
Music, food, sex.
Your rebirth is here.
Your grihalt.
Grihalt?
In our language, it means someone
who has achieved true life.
And as your sponsor,
it's my privilege to teach it to you.
And to introduce
you to our culture.
I saw you.
And I saw my brother.
The images you witnessed
are part of your ADE.
And after that experience triggered by
the genetic memories of your sponsor.
And your own synapses,
they rebuilt your cognitive functions.
The visions you witnessed
are sacred, Krista.
And must only be shared with
someone you really trust.
Don't touch me.
What did you do to me?
What did you do?
I saved you.
Take her with you.
This is a mistake.
What is? Her?
Yes, Marcus.
And when you were
turned, Chase?
Everyone starts somewhere.
And some...
start a lot lower in
life than Krista Starr.
You will take her on a ride along.
And you will teach her.
And you will dress her.
When the board finds out
what you've been doing.
Don't question me, Chase!
Ever!
I told the sister
everything I know.
You can't do that!
You can't do that... I'm protected.
Not from me.
If someone disappears down here,
who knows where they go?
I don't know.
Give me a name, Danny.
He's a cop, Boone. He got the
charges on Zack and I dropped.
You gotta understand
why we do this man.
We wanna be like you.
Strong, fast. And immortality, man.
I'm gonna live for freaking ever.
No, you won't.
Can you see it?
Krista?
See what?
Relax your eyes.
Pull your focus back.
Look!
I see something.
They can only be read in
the ultraviolet spectrum.
The House of Chthon's glyph.
It means it's ours.
Ours?
One of the places we recruit.
We also have save houses throughout the
city where fresh blood is delivered.
If you're out and dawn approaches,
you go.
But if you see the House of
Lychan glyph, stay away.
The thirst, it hurts.
Yes.
You'll drink.
Soon enough.
Fritz, go.
Blade, the
transponder's online.
I smell it.
Me too.
Drink.
Slowly, take it all in slowly.
When did that happen to you?
When did you become grihalt?
Marcus told you that,
didn't he?
It's his favorite word.
He says the same
speech to all of them.
All of who?
The new born. But with the strict
rules we live by, the enemies outside,
most of them don't last a year.
Did Marcus change you?
No. My husband did.
And lived to regret it.
He still does.
Hey!
You should be careful out there, honey.
These streets are dangerous.
There a bed inside?
You wouldn't believe what's inside.
You are just a little snack thing, huh?
Jesus.
I thought I told you my pets
are on the strict diet.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Don't pull that Dracula shit, sneaking
up on people, I almost crap myself.
You've been
overfeeding them again.
And for what?
A few dirty twenties?
I've got something for you.
Shit!
Blade.
Fat lady's early.
Burn her.
I told you too many times.
All right, all right,
I'll stay away ok?
You got to help me now.
If I was like you, I mean I could
do some much more. Come on!
Make me Marcus.
Make you?
I've put up with your desobedience
and carelessness long enough.
Come on man! I...
Wait a minute, you turned her?
That slacker sister!
It's my turn, my...
There is no room for someone
like you in my inner circle.
It's time to cut bait.
And unfortunately for you,
you're the only person
I know she hates.
You'll make it easy for her.
Now Krista,
it's time for your fist kill.
That's enough!
Live him be.
This is something she
must do on her own.
No...
Come along,
the new vaccine is ready.
Blade's here.
Deal with it.
Marcus, give me
the new vaccine.
No.
He is here.
Let me serve you.
Krista!
You can still fight it.
It's been fun.
His shit always works my ass!
Shen?
- Shen? Shen?
- I'm here, I'm here!
Shen, something's wrong.
Shen, make the fat
lady sing now!
I hope your earplugs are in,
buddy, here we go!
Fritz? That's enough.
You're my new favorite.
You've proven our success.
Shit!
Fat lady is recharging.
She's got one more hit in her.
Give me one sec to get
her to do it again.
She is singing again!
Blade, gotta juice. Coming in.
Shen, don't!
Sorry brother.
Go, goddamn it!
What did you do?
This stuff doesn't work,
but I found you, didn't I?
Up. There you go, big guy.
Next time I offer
backup you take it.
Good day, Fritz.
You did well, Krista.
How's Chase?
She'll be fine.
Marcus, the? would like a
few words with you, privately.
Of course.
Excuse me.
Marcus?
Yes.
The visions I saw
when I was changed.
The ones with my brother,
what did they mean?
What did you see?
Him and I,
a long time ago as kids in this
story book village we used to go to.
Zach wanted me to chase him.
He was trying to
show you something.
What should I do?
What you have been, follow him.
My stuff always works.
Not this time!
Where did you hit him?
Then it's something else.
So what the hell are
they doing here?
What did you do to me?
I injected you with a serum,
to get you thinking straight.
Krista, Krista!
That cop,
I ripped his throat out.
I killed him.
Listen,
if you take this
serum twice a day,
it might keep the
thirst under control.
Look, you wanted in,
and you're in.
In as far as you can go.
You're one of them.
So are you.
You can learn so much.
I can work with you.
Just like I worked
with your brother.
My brother?
Zack worked for you?
Yes. He was my contact here.
- Oh my god, you got him killed.
- No, Marcus did.
But Marcus was wrong about him.
He was a good man.
Give me the serum.
I got to get back.
What do you think?
Could go either away.
No!
Next time on Blade.
I need information on Fritz.
Like what?
He's not your every vampire.
I'm beginning to
think you like this.
You're sure the
vaccine is stable?
Yes, it's stable.
Then perhaps a new
day has dawned.
No!
Let's finish this.
Transcript: Rijad
Previously on Blade
Where are you
shipping the bodies ?
Detroit.
Who is taking possession ?
Marcus Van Sciver.
You've been picking through
a lot of keyholes, Zack.
It's my brother.
Your brother got caught up
and somebody shot him, okay ?
Got in over his head, he pissed off
the wrong people just like every
single one of these guys.
The ash. It's found its
way onto the streets now.
With the rest of the drugs.
There's a whole other world
underneath this one, Krista.
Do yourself a favor.
Get out of the city !
You know who killed my brother.
If we have a little patience,
we can find out what they're up to,
what their operations are.
You look familiar.
Like someone I once knew.
It's ok to fight.
It's only natural.
You turned her ?
It's my turn, my...
He's here.
Let me serve you.
It's been fun.
Fritz. That's enough.
You're my new favorite.
What did you do to me ?
I injected you with a serum,
to get you thinking straight.
I can work with you.
Just like I worked
with your brother.
I got to get back.
What do you think ?
Could go either away.
No !!!
You better do it !
Wouldn't want any vampire running
around the countryside, now would we ?
- Please, god!
- God's off playing with himself.
Just you and me now, lunch meat.
Blade The Series - 102 - Death Goes On
If they figured out how to neutralize
garlic and silver, we are chit ???
Any sign of Krista ?
Nothing.
Good morning, sweetheart.
You must be hungry.
Mom ?
You can't be here.
I know, it's all so confusing.
But it will come down.
You just need to eat.
Get out !
Get out !
Get out !
Krista !
No !
No !!!
Oh god...
Help ! Help ! Help !
Bloody newborns!
You had night terrors for ten years.
She won't last that long.
But she's gone
the first chance I get.
What's different ?
In this world.
What's new ?
Besides, you deciding to work with a
revenge-crazed vampire chick.
Ash.
Vampire ash.
Now you think Marcus is
juicing his own troups ?
I'll have to have Fritz
when I'll catch him.
You mean kill him.
Catch him.
Dissectr him.
Then kill him.
Does the silver burn?
No. It tickles.
I'm going to think
you like this.
Marcus.
- Pleasant flight?
- No complaints.
Heard you raised a few eyebrows.
It's a new girl ?
An essential addition to the fold.
And how is Prague ?
Missing you.
I'll never understand what
you see in this despicable city.
It has a special
place in my heart.
Hello, Winston.
Chase.
Fritz.
Trenched in blood as always.
And how are you ?
Feeling like a rock star ?
I'm feeling like a rematch.
Blade.
I see.
Is that wise?
No, not yet.
The  vaccine works. We should
take advantage of it.
Fritz.
Blade's interference must
make things difficult.
We're moving RND
to the West Coast.
Trucks carrying test subjects
should be arriving now.
Well, that will be welcomed
news for the board.
You're sure the
vaccine is stable ?
Yes, it's stable.
Then perhaps a new
day has dawned.
I haven't done ash in two days.
It's so hard.
Ok.
You spend this on aspirine,
antiseptic and food for your baby.
Cherry ? Cherry ?
You're listening to me ?
Yes, sir.
Next meeting
tomorrow on noon,
you stay out of
the ash until there.
And keep your fingers
out of your mouth.
Thank you, Reverend.
Sorry for the interruption.
The  church let you back in ?
They call me Reverend
out of respect.
You don't have to be
ordained to have a calling.
As you already know.
Having much success?
Some.
Vampire  ash ain't like
the usual junk.
best stuff hooks you bone deep.
I was wondering
if you'd ever return.
And now I can start worrying that
my recovering ashes are gonna get
caught up in your crossfire.
Your ashes ?
All they need is a little help and
I offer 'em empathy, support, love.
You should try it sometimes.
Back to the question.
There's some vampire
moving in on the ash trade.
Wouldn't surprise me.
Feeding off our own.
But you've heard
nothing concrete ?
Experiments.
On vampires, might be
ash related, might not.
How will I find out ?
You know an ash dealer named Cain ?
Not yet.
So maybe Cain will give
you some answers.
How do I find Cain ?
Try to ask one of
his customers.
But watch yourself.
If they're amped up on vampires dope,
you might find yourself in some serious shit.
Where's Cain ?
How much ash did you do?
All of it.
Like I've got
time for this.
I hear you're having
a difficult time.
Yeah, death's a bitch.
You're not dead, Krista.
My life is over.
What I was,
where I was going.
All that's gone.
Your life is
just beginning.
My life is what ?
Some sort of
a prisonner ?
My door's locked.
It's just a precaution.
Newborns sometimes snap.
It's only until your mind and body
reconcile with the metabolic changes.
Here I was thinking it was
because nobody trusted me.
Perhaps I haven't given
you the proper respect.
Yeah, throwing me off the
building was a little rude.
Yeah, you were trying to
kill me, let's not forget.
I haven't.
You will.
We should talk.
Aren't we ?
I mean over dinner.
I'll collect you
in one hour.
And what's
on the menu ?
Leftovers.
Courtesy of
Detective Boone.
We're not all monsters, Krista.
This will get easier.
I promise.
- Yes.
- This complicates things ?
Immeasurably.
Is Chase in on the joke ?
No.
Only the doctor.
And he's more surprised then I am.
It's all I can do to
keep on track.
Maybe this is fate trying
to tell you something.
Well, there is a bigger
picture Winston, much bigger.
Yes.
Let's hope the board never sees it.
I'll leave that up to you.
Safe journey.
And to you, my friend.
We're making a detour.
Take me to Meanus.
Yes, sir.
Who's this ?
Asher.
Is he high ?
Oh, yeah.
Son of a bitch.
One more time,
where's Cain ?
Go to hell !
Who is Cain ?
A lead that Carlyle gave me.
What about Fritz ?
Fine.
Then I won't tell you that Marcus
made reservation for two at Lotus.
How did you find out ?
Hey, it's what you
don't pay me for.
Is he with Krista ?
That, I can't tell you.
But it is his usual table.
From what I hear, a nice one.
Keep your fingers
away from him.
Anything here
tempt your palate ?
What are they tranqued with ?
You won't taste it.
It's a new herbal recipe.
Too many complaints with
the other stuff.
Mmh,  good.
But I was hoping for something
a little more cornfed.
It's not everyday I get to
sample American cuisine.
You're in luck.
I've just took possession of an honor
student from Illinois out on vacation.
Plucked from a Cancun beach.
Blonde, big boned.
Carpet matches drapes?
Hardwood floor.
Kids!
Don't be so surprised.
- I just... wasn't expecting...
- Food ?
Thank you.
Nutrionally, its effect are negligeable.
But it is pleasurable nonetheless.
You have noticed
your senses are hightened.
Is that what we're
living for now ?
Pleasure ?
Some of us.
As in most families, there are the
breadwinners and the freeloaders.
What are we ?
If I'm successful,
the House of Chthon is going to be
something different entirely.
What's that ?
Eternal.
You were thinking we are already ?
Apart from silver and
garlic we'll live forever ?
No.
Granted our years on this earth
are generous. But like most lives.
We're subjects to nature
occasional calling.
And your experiments
in the slaughterhouse ?
I'm assuring we are not
subject to anything.
Least of all nature.
- What about...
- Blade ?
Ashers ?
You know about them.
I know that there's a drug
trade based on dead vampires.
I'd imagine that's
a problem for you.
Increasingly.
Well, maybe one day
they'll take out Blade.
Blade isn't a vampire.
He's a Daywalker.
half human. And he is the bane
of the Twelve Houses.
Twelve Houses ?
Ah yes.
Your new family
is quite extended.
Is everyone here ?
No.
Just us.
You alright ?
- I don't think so.
- Krista !
It's the serum.
Food will make you sick.
That's nice to know.
- Marcus is up there.
- I know.
I need information
on Fritz.
Like what ?
He is not your average vampire.
Find out what you can.
How he did it.
Hurry.
Krista ?
Feeling better ?
Next stop ?
Hell !
Yo Cain.
Product's in the back.
He just fed so step
on it a few times.
How many times ?
23.
Just make it last.
Dipshit.
You're keeping the car ?
Crash it.
Is there a problem ?
Winston missed
his flight.
We can't trace the driver.
GPS ?
The signal was
terminated.
But we did get
a final fix.
Where ?
M eanus.
You're driving.
You are staying here.
I don't think that's
a good idea.
You said what?
If Blade took Winston...
In all likelyhood, you're
Blade number one target.
If you cross paths,
either you'll kill him,
he'll kill you
or quite possibly he'll take
you down and carve you up
thereby discovering and ruining
all of our considerable efforts.
I'm not going
to risk that.
Neither should you.
Is that quiet clear ?
Yeah.
Can I get something to drink now ?
You haven't told
where Cain is.
I don't know anything.
Swear to god !
You know.
Please, can I
get some blood ?
It'll chew off my gut.
How about an
appetizer ?
What happens now ?
He wakes up in a ditch and
leads me to Cain.
That's positive
thinking ?
He's an addict.
I'm a threat.
He needs to protect
his source.
Something I know
a little about.
We found him maybe 30
minutes after Winston left.
Look, Blade's in town, right ?
Maybe Blade got him.
Blade got Winston.
The man is a scurge.
You really should do
something about it.
This wasn't Blade.
Blade wouldn't have just
stopped Winston.
He would have come in here, slaughtered
you and then freed the poor soldiers
celled to people like us.
Where can Chase find a towel?
There's a closet
in there.
So,
how was your
asher problem ?
It's not so bad.
Ok.
Ok, so we've had some
little trouble lately.
Please, Marcus,
don't shut me down.
Look, I'm upgrading security.
I've a vested interest in keeping
my clientele as safe as possible.
And how many of your clients
have you lost so far ?
This month, 4...
5 if you want to count Winston.
If I must ?
What's with the towel ?
He's shuting you down.
That's a private party ?
Yeah.
Get out !
I thought you were
Marcus' right hand man.
Seems strange him
not letting you...
do what you do.
He has his reasons.
Which you don't
agree with.
Not sure I do either.
Things change.
Take you.
One day you're
home from Iraq.
The next thing you're
the boss' new plaything.
You're walking around,
asking questions.
I'm asking you.
What happened ?
I don't get why Blade
would wanna carve you up.
What's he gonna learn ?
Nothing.
He'll be dead.
And I'll be the
one to kill him.
In broad daylight.
But that's not possible.
Like I said, things change.
One day you're scared
shitless of a pizza topping.
And the silver fillings
of some old man's teeth.
Of the dawn's early
goddamn light.
The sun doesn't
matter anymore.
Because you're different.
Because you believed
in something.
You helped make some
things happen.
What happened ?
Project Aurora.
Five years and
millions of dollars.
And a thousand dead
vampires later.
You get me...
The vaccines were a success,
and where am I ?
In the basement,
beating meat.
Sorry.
Honey, it's okay.
It will be over soon,
I promise.
Just need to
talk about this.
I'm sorry I don't know. I swear to
god, I don't know anything.
We know you use it.
That you use us.
That your blood smells so bad that
it makes me want to drown you in it.
I'll quit snorting ash,
I will I promise.
I've got a baby.
I've  got a little
boy please.
Does his blood reak too ?
No, no, no, no,
please, no !
You tell me you took my friend
Winston and your boy grows
safe and sound.
Cross my barely
beating hearts.
Give me a name or I'll eat
him in front of you.
I think we must assume
that Winston is gone.
Yes, Charlotte, yes.
I'm taking care
of that problem.
Yes, but as I outlined in the proposal,
Blade's involvement is inevitable.
I'm just surprised
you're taking this...
Yes, Charlotte, absolutely.
Everything will be handled.
All assets will be secured.
They want proof of
Aurora's success.
I'm right here.
But there're not willing to
send another evaluator.
They want you in Prague.
And you want me as far
away from Blade as possible.
I know you're eager to
finish what you started.
But Blade must wait.
I'm beholden from those above me,
and they demand caution.
We have done an amazing thing but
no one must know how we did it.
Fritz ?
Fritz tells me you caught
him in a weak moment.
Aurora ?
I want it.
You want ?
We should all have it.
If it's everything that
Fritz said it is.
Fritz has no idea what it is.
And neither do you.
And you will not discuss it
anymore especially with Fritz.
What did you do to him ?
He's going away tonight.
Some place safe.
Marcus.
The girl,
she knew who took Winston.
- Are you certain ?
Dead. His name is Cain.
He deals in ash.
We hit him.
We hit the largest
ash lab in Detroit.
I can have a red
team ready in one hour.
Good.
Let's take the war hero.
I'm sure you'll find it
invigorating.
That's a splendid idea.
Krista.
Keep your head down.
Where are you going?
A warehouse in West Mile.
Where you ate the raver ?
Stop with me.
You best get packed.
See you in a few days.
Kill everything.
Burn it to the ground.
Hey !
Let me in.
Hey, let me in !
I got to see Cain,
I got to warn him.
Shit's coming down.
Blade.
I didn't tell him anything.
You didn't have to.
Stupid son a bitch !
Man, I did you a favor.
Thanks for that.
Give me the belt.
Guys, down there.
Stay with me.
This way !
We got movement on
the north side.
Say again.
Repeat, movement inbound.
Get a fix and pin it down.
We'll do. I'll investigate
and report back.
Let's get going.
Sorry, sir.
Just listening to
the assault feed.
- Seems like Chase's got her hands full.
- What's happening ?
- Not sure, something inbound.
- Really?
Go !
They're gone.
Something over here !
Where's Cain ?
Chase ?
Shut up.
God, don't !
I can't move my leg.
So much for the frying pan.
Welcome to the fire.
Fritz !
Stop, Fritz !
Let's finish this !
Krista, don't let
him take Fritz !
Krista, kill him !
Do it now !
You think she's gone native?
No.
She killed the golden goose.
Fritz was the key.
She did what
she had to do.
She's the key.
She's the way in.
And what about Cain ?
Another day.
Hey ?
Wake up !
Dispatcher, I need a
coroner on county 319,
2 miles east of the Boxton overpass
overpassed and a tow truck.
Better tell the crime lab to.
What you got ?
Body under a blanket
in a silver Dodge.
South Dakota plate 3 6 Adam 4 7 9 current.
Body appears male.
No obvious signs of foul play.
Hardware's rolling.
ETA in 15 minutes.
Thanks, Dany.
Somebody in there ?
I'm a state trooper. I'm armed.
Come out hands first.
Dispatch, I need
an ambulance ASAP.
Did you say an ambulance ?
Come back.
Too late for that, sweetheart.
Next time on Blade.
I think we waked up
the neighboors.
Ready to answer
my question ?
I need you to
make a delivery.
Do I need to know
what it's in the bag ?
Do you ?
You killing vampires ?
Scum from the House of Armaya.
You ???
Jesus Christ !
Transcript : Rijad
Previously on Blade.
You know an ash dealer named Kane?
Used to be a familiar.
Next stop?
Hell.
Dispatch, I need an ambulance ASAP.
It's a little late for that, sweetheart.
Kill everything. Burn it to the ground.
Krista!
Kill Fritz! Do it now!
Deep breath, sweety.
This might sting.
I think we woke the neighbors.
Screw them.
I've got a better idea.
What's the problem, asshole?
Ready to answer my question?
I didn't know you asked one.
If you weren't running,
you would have heard it.
Wow!
Okay! Okay!
Ask me the question.
Sands. A vampire.
You know him?
No. Yeah! Yeah, Sands.
I know him.
I was his personal familiar for a while.
Quick is the perk with shit.
How do I find him?
Man, how the hell would I know?
Shit!
Goddamn it!
The guy's got a habit.
Gambling.
- He hangs out in casinos?
- Huh-uh.
He got a favorite one?
I don't know, man, something shitty.
Something with bad lighting,
he doesn't like to be looked at.
He got pretty messed up a while back.
What? That's it?
Bonus question.
Great.
You pissed off the House of Chthon.
Do you know how?
Yeah, I ashed a heavy hitter.
Winston Haupt.
Haupt?
You're sure?
Two years ago, I watched him
serv up a cubscout at a party.
I'm sure.
Hey! Hey! Hey, do not
take my money!
That is some bullshit!
Hey!
About you ashing vampires...
Yeah?
Keep it up.
Blade The Series - 103 - Descent
That's tags?
Yeah, car belongs to one Patricia Barton.
Waitress, married, mother of 3.
Disappeared some place between
her last shift and her home in
Spearfith, South Dakota.
I went to her wedding.
They were about to adopt.
It's connected to that rest
stop thing at Sturges?
What thing?
Just came in. Trucker vanished
from the rest stop.
Lots of blood, no body.
Whoever it was torched the cargo.
Where's the truck?
- Have to ask Sturges.
- You ask 'em.
Please.
I'm told you're not
drinking enough.
The more hemoglobin your
body metabolizes,
the faster you regenerate
damaged tissue.
Allow me.
The curative properties should
be particularly potent...
I just fed.
Sorry about Fritz.
His demise was an
unfortunate necessity.
One you recognized
and acted upon.
Otherwise Blade would
have taken him.
For preventing that,
you have my most
sincere appreciation.
Only few have faced
Blade and survived.
I guess I got lucky.
No, you had an angel
on your shoulder.
How are you feeling?
Thankful.
It's amazing... sometimes...
how things work out.
Krista needs her rest.
I think we can leave
this door unlocked now.
And Krista...
don't forget to drink.
Oh, thank you.
What's this?
For services rendered.
You found Kane.
Is he dead?
Man's doing a public service.
Keeping people hooked
on dead vampire ash?
Sometimes you have to take
the good with the bad.
From my side, it's all bad.
Well, if you can't use it.
Wait, wait, no, I can use it.
I can use it.
It's just...
I'm out here treating the symptom
and you're going after the disease,
no doubt about it.
What's you point?
There might be another approach.
Not for me.
Good luck.
You know it's all getting bad,
don't you?
It always does.
Krista! Thank God!
Are you all right?
Where did I get this?
Can't remember.
I gave it to you.
Your 6th birthday.
Honey, where have you been?
We haven't heard
from you in days.
I've been busy.
Well, where are you staying?
Uncle Pat's been looking everywhere.
I'm sorry.
Honey, are you in trouble?
Just trying to make things right.
For us.
For Zach.
For Zach?
Oh Krista!
What are you doing?
I'm just...
I'm just letting you know
I won't be around for a while.
Mom! Mom!
- Here. Here. Go over here.
- No, I'm ok.
I'm good. I'm good.
- What's the matter?
- I'm fine.
I just don't wanna lose you.
Krista, if anything bad happened,
Zach's gone.
You're all I have left.
I know we've had our troubles...
Mom.
I just want time.
I want to get to know
my daughter again.
I want it like it was.
There'll be time for that.
But I need to do this first.
And I need you to trust me.
Please.
You're so cold.
If I can track you,
so can Chthon.
I had to see my mother.
Get in.
If Marcus even suspects
you still have links to your past...
Marcus spends his time
renovating old buildings,
- I don't think having a link to my past...
- That's his cover.
Yours doesn't include
dropping in on mom's.
If you're pissed about Fritz...
No.
You played it right.
How's that healing?
- Slowly.
- Good.
What did they give to Fritz
to make him immune?
- It's called Aurora.
- What is?
Some kind of vaccine.
Marcus made it.
No.
Someone made it for him.
- Any ideas about that?
- No.
- Are they all on it?
- I don't know.
Get me a sample.
Sure I'll get right on that.
And while I'm doing that,
what are you gonna be doing?
Looking for a vampire named Sands.
Why?
He may be one of Marcus'
failed experiments.
See if he can lead me to
the doctor in charge.
I didn't sign up for this.
Yes, you did.
You wanted to know what Marcus
is up to, I told you.
If I get you this vaccine,
this Aurora thing,
that's your proof.
After that,
I'm done.
Come on!
Son of a bitch!
Used to be a halfly
respectable joint.
Now they let in
everybody in here.
Let's go.
Or what?
You're gonna stake me right here?
Take a hike, daywalker.
Eye in the sky is watching you.
Okay, go ahead.
Kill me, see if I care.
'Cause living for everything
ain't nothing but one long bust.
What? You're gonna sunglass
me to death?
Wondering about the scars.
Go to hell.
What do you want?
I wanna know who did that.
Okay.
You want information I wanna
keep breathing so...
here are my terms.
Here are the terms.
You talk and you get to
keep your rotten dick.
Ah ah! Junk grows back!
Then I'll be busy.
Time to run!
That's off limits.
Oh, it is?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
This place is like a maze.
Where's the kitchen?
Marcus wants you.
Now.
You don't trust her, do you?
I trust your judgement.
That wasn't the question.
Yes, it was.
How are you this evening?
Bored?
You can say it.
No, just wondering what
I'm gonna be doing
for the next few hundred years.
Some decades I wondered the same.
We're shorthanded at the moment.
We need you to make a delivery.
140 Park Place. Give that to Vanessa.
Carver and Schultz.
- Is that a law firm?
- No.
Well, do I need to know
what's in the bag?
Do you?
The clock is ticking.
Evening, boys.
This is a private game.
I've got my invitation right here.
Hey, hot stuff. Johnny Black
on the rocks.
Hold the rocks, make it a double.
You were cheating vampires?
Yeah, mostly scum from
the House of Armaya.
You fleest Armayans.
And I thought you
lived dangerously.
2,000.
Raise. 5,000.
Oh yeah? Gotta be in it
to win it, huh?
Call.
Cheater!
Hey, today must be my lucky day.
You know?
Think again, hot stuff.
I walked right into an ambush.
They dragged us out and they locked
us up in cages right there.
The whole operation was right there.
The lab, scientists types
and lots of knives.
How did you get out?
A few weeks later, I found a
loose brick in the wall.
that lead to a crack in the
foundations so I crawled through,
dug my way out.
Some of the others were behind
me when it all hit the fan.
They didn't make it.
Pal, I've been reading
faces a long time.
Yours is telling me you know
exactly what's going on.
Who carved me up?
The hired help.
Research scientists who work
for one of the Houses.
Researching what?
Tell me. What was I there for?
What was I there for?
What I need from you is a name.
The doctor in charge.
I don't have one.
Okay? Nobody used names.
No nametags.
Okay, let's go.
Go where?
Go there? No!
No way. i'm not going.
You're kidding me?
Just in case.
Carver and Schultz?
I think you missed all the fun.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
I'm just glad the damn
thing is finally over.
Vanessa's been expecting you.
Vanessa?
Only as fast as I can.
Sorry, I thought you were my boss.
No problem, just making a delivery.
Is everything okay?
Tell the doctor I said thanks.
Sure.
Which doctor should I thank?
I work for a few.
Okay, seen enough can we go now?
You get the point, right?
There's not much to see here so...
Keep it up, he's gonna
nail your jaw shut.
Ah! Looks like a dead-end to me.
Now can you just take me back
or kill me, please?
Or you could smash my
head through a wall.
You want the 6 or the 9?
The 9 should do.
Watch our backs.
Hey, how about I get one
of he big weapons?
Shut up.
No, really, my timing's off.
I've got this thing with my eye...
Seriously, shut up!
They kept 10 of us in here.
All from the House of Armaya.
Except me.
First 2 weeks, they didn't feed us.
No blood, no nothing.
Then when we were
too weak to stand,
took us out one by one.
And did what?
We're not talking about that.
Lab was down here.
Let's get this over with.
Stop!
Four aces, my ass!
I ain't good.
I'm hungry.
Buffet is closed, Pal.
Time to follow. We gotta go.
I've got one last
thing I gotta kill.
Get out of here. You're done.
What?
Don't make him say it twice.
I think we may have the doctor's home.
How?
Trace those.
Tell me who bought that.
Might just be another
Van Sciver front.
Might not be.
Hope you don't mind.
Pretty. Where did you get it?
Found it. What are you doing?
Seeing what you have to wear.
These aren't my clothes.
I don't know where
they came from.
We pick a few things up here
and there, along the way.
Did you make the delivery?
Yeah.
Did you peek?
I bet you peeked, didn't you?
No.
We're going out.
Just you and me.
Still haven't found the truck driver.
But if the prints are in the system,
we should get a hit by tomorrow.
You said they were pallets.
Right over here.
Who's he cargo?
Based on the remains,
we think it was people.
Alive?
Dead folk don't need oxygen.
What is this?
Sex trafficking,
illegal body parts,
I've never seen this before.
For the record, the truck has
Michigan's plates
but there's no record of any
company based out of Michigan
or anywhere in the country
for that matter by the name
of American Butcher.
It's hot fire.
To get this kind of ash,
you need 1500 degrees.
And the truck, it's barely burned.
Not likely when the fire
lasts 2 seconds.
So how does that happen?
You caught me.
This is interesting.
This pallet is pretty
much untouched.
There is no ignition source.
Either there was nothing on it
or maybe somebody came along
and took what was there
before doing the driver and
torching the cargo.
What's this gotta do
with your kidnapping?
Maybe nothing it
was just a busy night.
And weird.
Very weird.
I'll be over there if you have
any more questions.
Hi, my name is Sarah.
Hi, Sarah.
I had a rough week.
Not that anyone
cares all that much.
But I got through it.
One day at a time, right?
Look, I'm not gonna stand here
and play victim.
Sure it would be really easy,
I could tell you my ex husband
was a real sick bastard.
Tell you how he'd get wasted
and smack me around.
Bring his buddies home so they
could have their turn.
That's not who I am anymore.
That pathetic,
cowering little girl
is long dead and buried
along with all the nightmares
and all the suffering.
Nobody gets to hurt me anymore.
Nobody.
Just sitting the whole funny.
Trolling for the drags,
the ones no one will miss.
Well, all right Sarah.
Takes a mighty strong woman
to do what you did.
And I love strong women.
That'd be my addiction of choice.
If you had a choice.
- Name is Phil.
- Pleased to meet you.
Who's your friend?
Oh, that's Chuck.
Chuck!
Chuck, meet Carol.
Hey, Carol.
Yeah, so I've been rebuilding
the thing for about a year now.
It was my dad's truck so...
sentimental reasons and all that.
Sure.
Hey, Carol.
Do you think you kids may wanna
run off and have a good time?
- Run off where?
- Well...
We're going in here.
If this alley's a-rocking.
Don't come a-knocking.
- Your friend's pretty funny.
- Yeah.
- So, how long have
you been sober for?
- No!
What do you mean no?
Oh, you need a drink
to loosen up.
Stupid bitch!
Phil?
You gotta get out of here!
Hey, you're all right man?
Phil?
Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?
- I...
- You're gonna eat that?
Don't sweat it.
A puppet killed takes a little
getting used to.
We should go.
Just a second.
After you.
Everybody okay?
We're fine. My boyfriend
just passed out!
Okay, according to customs,
the entire production
batch was shipped
from a manufacturer in Pennsylvania
to a clearing house in the Ukraine.
Set for 9 months before being
shipped back to the US
and sold to one Ravenson
Wholesale Medical.
Right here in Detroit.
Ravenson medical database for
Detroit number is 2700.
- 2700 customers?
- Give or take.
- Get me one.
- I'm grounding through that now.
How you doing? Keeping your
blood pressure down?
Dropping in unannouced?
Not a good idea.
Yeah, well, I saw 2 men
murdered last night.
- Did you feed?
- Screw you!
- Did you?
- No.
You need more serum.
I'm fine. Considering...
You just came by
to cry on my shoulder?
What about Aurora?
I know where they're keeping
it but security's tight.
Get around it.
How about I just
tell you where it is
and then you can go
in and get it yourself?
Too noisy.
Since when that's ever been
a problem for you?
I've been doing this a long time.
I make a move, they counter it.
They make a move, I react.
It's time to change the game.
If I'm gonna keep them from
winning this fight,
I have to trust another human being.
Just so happens she's a vampire.
And how hard is that?
Almost impossible.
Take care of yourself.
I'll get you what you want.
Thank you.
In case you're interested,
I found the doctor.
You a cop?
Took the eggs overeasy.
Sure.
I bet your family doesn't
appreciate you bringing your
work home with you.
It doesn't bother them anymore.
And a bacon too.
Sure.
Good luck with that.
Collins.
Hey, I've got these print
results back from the truck.
Okay, hold on.
Okay, go ahead.
The print belongs to
a fellow out of Detroit.
- Name?
- Brian Boone.
510. 190 pounds.
Oh, and he just happens to be
one of Detroit's finest.
He's a cop?
A homicide detective to be precise.
One who's been recently
listed as missing.
- Is this your guy?
- I'll let you know.
Can I help you?
Next time on Blade.
Blade!
Welcome home, old man.
I can deliver you Blade,
wrapped up and ready to die.
- What's in Oregon?
- The House of Lychan.
They know where Boone is.
No, you do.
Lychan is just going to take it out.

Previously on Blade
He was born a different
kind of vampire.
He has all of their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.
Except of the thirst.
He lives off a synthetic serum.
- Did Marcus change you?
- My husband did.
And lived to regret it.
Now Krista, it's time
for your first kill.
Dispatch, I need
an ambulance ASAP.
Did you say an ambulance ?
A little late for that, sweetheart.
The print belongs to
a fellow out of Detroit.
Brian Boone. 510. 190 pounds.
Oh, and he just happens to be
one of Detroit's finest.
He's a cop?
I'm out here
treating the symptom
and you're going after the
disease, no doubt about it.
What's your point?
There might be
another approach.
Not for me.
What did they give to Fritz
to make him immune?
- It's called Aurora.
- What is?
Some kind of vaccine.
Marcus made it.
No. Someone made it for him.
Everything's come back.
Amnosynthesis tested
negative for AFPE.
No blood disorders,
no neurotube defects,
and no abnormalities
on the sonogram.
So our baby's fine?
He's perfectly normal.
Doctor Vonner?
Where is the doctor?
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
There's a dead-end.
I suggest you get his
files and get out of there.
No time for that.
Send me his home address.
Marcus got his people
in and out right now.
So you think this baby
doctor thing was just for fun?
There's a reason Marcus
recruited him for Aurora.
Hm, if you believe this guy's press.
He was a miracle worker.
He looks like he worked
one for Marcus.
Every vampire needs a
familiar with skills.
Yeah, I make the weapons.
And I use them.
That's the arrangement.
No shit!
I thought we were dating.
Blade?
Blade?
Nailed is ass.
Damn straight.
Blade The Series - 104 - Bloodlines
Chain him up.
Zack was here.
Can I get you anything else?
No, I'm done.
All right, you can pay at
the register when you're done.
You play soccer?
Good evening.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Well...
That is a dead-end.
Every vampire needs a
familiar with skills.
Ah, I make the weapons,
and I use them,
that's the arrangement.
Bullshit, I thought
we were dating.
Little man.
*** this.
Damn straight.
We have Aurora.
We know it works.
You were going to kill
Doctor Vonner anyway.
Blade just saved you the trouble.
At the moment, I have
different troubles.
Those shipments were
your responsability.
And so is Boone,
I'll take care of him.
No.
You and Krista will together.
I don't need her!
Boone is Krista's first turn.
There's a connection between
them that can be exploited.
Marcus... not the House of Lychan.
The shortest distance between
Boone and Krista is through
theit shared experience.
I'll find Boone another way.
- He left a trail...
- That ends in the middle of Kansas!
I don't have time to humor
your sordid past!
Find Boone and use Krista!
What?
Charlotte's calling.
Tell her we'll find Boone.
I'm gonna tell her
you already have.
Hey!
Blade?
Blade?
Carlyle.
I'm here to negociate for
your release. You're okay?
Shut up and start negociating!
Things need killing.
Well, that's just it.
I'm, I'm negotiating with you.
I'm with them, this was my idea.
Then I'll be killing you too!
Little help?
Heard you halfway down the hall.
Gained a little weight?
Time to clean up your mess.
Boone...
He's loose and
complicating matters.
That's impossible.
I killed him.
You turned him.
To kill him, you'd
have to drain him.
Being an amateur, you didn't.
Now you're gonna see how
the other half lives.
- Other half of what?
- Us.
Pack a bag.
- We're flying to Oregon.
- What's in Oregon?
The House of Lychan.
And they know where Boone is?
No, you do.
Lychan's just
going to take it out.
Wait a minute.
You mind telling me what
I'm walking into?
Sweetheart, walking in
is not a problem.
I bet you wonder why you're here.
I told you there was another
way to fight the war.
You weren't always the man you are now.
You still need a little redemption.
With the help of
a few old friends.
Just go ahead.
Say hello.
Remember him?
Remember your childhood.
Little man.
Steppin' Razor.
It's been a while.
What you're going by now little man: Blade.
You got a deep rep,
you're big, bro!
Not too big though.
Welcome home, little man.
Blade?
Hello?
Blade's gone.
Taken off the street by
four masked vampires.
- Now what would you know about that?
- Shen...
Where is he?
- Marcus didn't do it.
- Bullshit.
You come here to
finish things off?
You don't believe me?
Shoot.
What are you doing here?
Boone's alive.
- The cop?
- He is turned.
No shit. That's what
happen when a vampire...
Shut up, and get the
gun out of my face!
Boone's going around
killing people and Chase
and I have been ordered
to eliminate him.
Shen?
I don't know what
happened to Blade.
Ok.
I got to torch
this place and go.
Wait a minute.
You're leaving?
That's the protocol.
What happens to me?
We all got problems.
Shen, what do you know about
the House of Lychan?
Lychan vampires have sworn off
killing, they drink clone blood.
I'm going there to find Boone.
He's there?
No.
Then why are you...
Oh, well...
What?
You can't go Krista.
They have this ritual.
You've ever heard sweat lodge the
native American thing where you see visions?
What, they want me to see Boone?
That's the idea,
except there's no sweat.
Just lots of blood.
How much blood?
You can't do it.
If it will stop Boone...
I'm doing it.
Hey!
Good luck with Blade.
I've got serum.
You're gonna need more.
And after it's done,
inject it, all of it.
First chance you get.
Ok, thanks.
Good luck to you too.
Jesus!
Blade? Blade???
*** this.
Damn straight.
What is that?
It's the last transmission.
Rewind it.
I can hear them.
It's static.
Shen, I can hear them.
I thought we were dating.
- It's taken off of context.
- Shh.
Blade? Blade???
*** this.
Damn straight.
What?
They're still talking.
Play it again.
He ain't so bad.
He used to be.
But he's no
Bad Blood anymore.
Bad Blood?
Bad Blood...
I guess you're pretty
thristy by now.
Probably want to get back
on that serum of yours.
Yeah, I know about that.
And I know what you
did on the streets.
After your father left.
Before Whistler found you,
such bad things to these poor boys.
They're weren't
exactly boyscouts.
But they took you
in off the streets.
And you took their souls
for it, you took their lives.
Cue the violins.
Because they were been turned by you,
they've been rejected by every House.
Forced to live on their own, to do
horrible things just to survive.
I can fix them.
I've gotten through to them.
They want stop feeding,
stop killing.
They just need your
serum to do it.
They don't want my serum.
They want me,
and now that they've got me,
you're nothing but their next meal.
Your real bleeding heart here...
I can't believe how much
you've changed little man.
I wish that I could tell
you that it's not too late
That you could come back.
Be a brother again.
But we got plans we need to execute.
Let me guess...
Comfort plan.
Yeah.
You're gonna help us, little man.
You're gonna change our life.
You're Agent Collins?
You're Detective Gibbs?
I'm, you're ready?
Yep.
How long were you
and Boone partners?
About two years.
The last six months, he was more
of a solo act.
Took a lot of personal time.
Any idea why?
We stopped talking,
I mean about anything other than
the number of girls he was banging.
Pretty long list
if you believe the stories.
Did you?
There was a lot of detail.
Any talk of
personal problems,
where he might have gone
if things got bad?
Like a beach in Bahi or something? No.
He talked about the future a lot,
what he'd like to live in a 100 years from now.
What like science-fiction?
No, not really, more like,
like standard vacation.
Yeah, I didn't get it either.
- You need a key?
- You got one?
He speaks German?
The only thing I ever saw him read
was a menu and he couldn't pronounce half of it.
You recognize this?
What's Armaya?
Look at you.
Playing vampire cop.
You won't think I'm playing
when I turn your ass up in smoke!
Yeah.
There's that look.
Are you trying to tell me you're
going to kill me?
Who taught you that look?
You were a kid,
lost and scared!
No place for nobody.
A scrowny ass, little blood sucker.
You fed, you killed.
Some you turned.
Remember that night
you turned us?
Bolt was joining us.
I was giving him his tats.
I was just wiping the fresh blood off the back of neck. You must have tasted in the air.
That's what brought you to us.
Back when we were just kids.
I was just a kid too!
No!
That night you were a killer.
You walk right into
this place here.
All shaking and crying
and saying you were hungry.
We offered you shelter and food.
We reached out to help you.
You bit us for it.
You turned us into addicts.
Gave us the thirst.
That pain so deep inside
that it never goes away.
Oh, yeah, you got the thirst
right now, don't you?
That's what you gave us.
But we ran with it.
And you ran with us.
Hell.
You were proud to wear our mark
and live under our protection.
But you were smaller
than the others.
Different.
A brother.
I would have done anything for you, Little Man.
And I did.
I killed a lot of people.
You were killing way before
I even met you.
And that's what will
be when this is over.
That's how we survive.
Damn!
You really don't know what you
did to us after you left.
You remember that night
Whistler came knocking ?
That old man killed Brick,
and cut off before
he drag you away.
We told he'd ash
your sorry ass!
About a decade later,
we started to hear rumors about
this vampire killer named Blade.
Big bad scary mother.
Tatoos crawling up the
back of his neck.
Sunlight don't burn him.
Guess Whistler gave you
a different thirst,
a thirst for killing us addicts.
Addicts that you turned
us too.
When you got your new rep,
as a daywalker,
all the Houses started ashing
every vampire you ever turned.
Every one that comes from your blood.
Bad Bloods had go underground.
Like goddamn rats!
While you traveled all over the world.
But you're home now.
Hell!
You even still
dress like a Bad Blood.
With the coat, the glasses.
You still got our mark.
But it wasn't you.
Rep says, uh,
without your serum,
you can't see straight.
Every minutes that goes pass,
you're more like us.
Feel the thirst, like us!
Hurt like us!
Bleed like us!
I will keep you alive.
I need you alive.
Nothing can take back
what happened.
No.
Nothing can.
But... you can help us, little man.
You can help us live our whole
long lives a whole lot better!
See, we're tired of hiding!
We want what we gave you!
A home.
Wherever you build it,
I'm gonna burn it down!
Little man still thinks
he's gonna be a hero.
He's crazy but it's
good to have a dream.
Reality is always better.
Especially when we've got an ace in the hole.
Give me that.
You get something for that.
I'll get it.
You just be sure you save me some.
Gang violence on the rise.
Bad Bloods terrorize Krainze
Woods neighborhood.
Bad Bloods gang member
shot, paralysed.
Hello, Chase.
- A pleasure to see you again.
- Save the talk.
And you must be Krista.
I'm Doctor Berganza, we are
absolutely delighted to
have you here.
Everything's been prepared.
Let's go, ladies,
we have a lot to do.
If you'd like to leave
your bags here, somebody
will collect them.
It's not often that we get
visitors from other Houses
for the most part
they seem to stay away.
Possibly because
you're all bat shit.
If that assesment eases your
discomfort in some way
then by all means you stick
to it as long as you require.
But the dialisys machines
are downstairs.
The what?
It's an essential step in the processing.
We keep things very clean here.
Yes, because according to
the freaks, we are dirty girls,
our blood must be cleansed.
Apparently it reaks of death.
It does.
Hello, Chase.
And how is life with Marcus?
Never a dull moment.
How nice for you.
Are you going to introduce me?
Krista, meet Frederick.
My ex-husband.
Why have you suddendly
got ambition?
Well you got to start somewhere.
Yes, yes you do.
Although, you unfortunately
started with Blade.
What does that mean?
That means he turned you.
And now I hear you and your
lost boys are looking for a home?
We just want in.
I'll be blunt.
My superiors will not
allow streets scum
tainted by the blood of the
Daywalker in the House of Chthon.
We'd not adopt polluted strays.
You must try the House of Sacara,
they're... less particular.
Yeah.
About that Daywalker...
And...
this means what to me?
It means that I can deliver you Blade,
wrapped up and ready to die.
And for this gift you want
keys to my front door?
I think your superior
will make an exception.
What do you think?
I think you like risk.
Could pay off if it's worth it.
Sometimes you have to take
things to get things.
I'm sure you've taken plenty.
Things your superiors
know nothing about.
And you're planning on
taking more, don't you?
A lot more.
Ah, it's how men like you and me
get the respect that we deserve.
Oh, is that what you're doing?
Getting respect?
I'm giving you Blade!
You're gonna kill him or not?
Welcome.
Now where do I find him?
Germaine Turner?
You got the wrong guy.
Mmh.
In case you're thirsty.
Who are you?
Doesn't matter.
After this, you'll
never see me again.
What?
Back in the seventies,
you used to be a member of a street
gang called the Bad Bloods?
After you were shot, what happened
to the rest of the gang?
They disappear.
They all die.
How did they die?
Little man.
Little man?
Who's...?
So I won't find the bodies
in a cemetary, will I?
Now you listen to me.
If you got anybody
that cares about you,
that loves you,
or depends on you for living,
you'll stop asking questions
and stop looking for whatever
it is you're looking for.
Cause if you find it,
you'll wish to God you didn't.
You see,
it's because somebody
depends on me for living,
that thing I'm looking for,
I'm gonna find it.
And that thing
is whatever you son of bitches
called a home.
Now tell me where I can
find the Bad Bloods?
How long is this gonna take?
That's up to you.
Listen to me,
this isn't magic,
there's no pentagrams using,
chanting and essence burning.
When we kill,
what you've done or you wouldn't
be here, energy's released.
Which takes you into an after death
that experience.
Been there.
So has Boone.
Because of you,
you're connected.
Now because of your
new metabolic chemistry,
your senses have been retuned,
calibrated higher.
What we do here is simply
turn up the dial even more.
If we can turn it
high enough,
you can pick up the energy
of your first kill.
You'll be able to find
him wherever he is.
Now here is the rough part,
you're going to come out of
this incredibly thirsty.
You must be careful,
not to drink too much
blood too fast.
Or what?
Or Boone's energy will take
root in your soul.
And whoever you were will
be gone forever.
I'm already gone.
Whoever you were,
still very strong in you.
I can see that.
And you'd better be careful
because Chase can see it too.
Now don't worry.
I'll be your guide.
I've got some experience on this.
With Chase?
You turned her?
Yes.
Sorry to break this up.
But can we please get this over with?
Let's find your problem,
child, shall we?
You get us
into this, little man.
You'll get us out.
Marcus Van Sciver exposed me that.
One more last thing
to do before we...
turn you over to our
new family, Blade.
Let's take those tatoos back.
And cut that skin clean off.
That's it, little man.
Scream for me.
***
I used to be like you.
I used to be his friend.
But he screws us all over.
Everyone he touches, he hurts.
Mostly he just touches vampires.
And yeah, it hurts.
Another time, little man.
So much for the Cosby kids.
I swear to God, if you
say thank you I'm quitting.
Just give me a minute.
Where is Krista?
Oh that's a story.
Funny.
Suck me.
Collins? That's me Gibbs.
Brought you those files you asked for.
All of Boone's open cases.
Do me a favor, don't tell my Cap'.
I wanted the last three months.
That's what you got.
What can I say, Detroit is
a dangerous place to live.
Runaways, protistutes,
roll over pushers.
Boone's specialty.
I guess you could say he had
a soft spot for lost souls.
What about this one?
What's the name?
Starr, Zach Starr?
Single GSW to the head,
no viable suspects,
yes, that's one of Boone's
special projects.
- You heard of this?
- Yeah.
Case was never closed.
What about the soldier?
I assumed Boone
wanted to screw her.
- Did he?
- I don't know.
She went missing,
if she turns up,
you can ask her.
If she's still alive...
Next time on Blade.
- What did you see?
- I know, I know!
His next stop, it's
a small town in Louisiana.
Just kill him and come home.
She's pregnant,
but the question is...
of what.
I believe we may have
a problem with Marcus.
Dust 'em all!
Boone!
Ahh, you stay away from me!

If they figured out how to neutralize
garlic and silver, we are up shit's creek.
- You're sure the vaccine is stable?
- Yes, it's stable.
Trace those. Tell me who bought that.
Doctor Vonner...
No!!!
What do you know about
the House of Lychan?
You can't go Krista.
They have this ritual.
You've ever heard of a sweat lodge,
the native American thing where
you see visions?
What, they want me to see Boone?
That's the idea,
except there's no sweat.
Just lots of blood.
If it will stop Boone...
I'm doing it.
Hey sis'!
Zach?
How you doin'?
I missed you so much!
Mmh, I missed you too!
How is Mom?
She's ok.
Too bad she doesn't know
you're a vampire.
She's not gonna know.
What are you doing out here?
What do you mean?
I mean, right place,
wrong time.
I need to feel the sun.
You need to finish
what you started.
Zach, I want to be done.
Oh sweetie, it's just beginning.
Boone's in there.
The eyes of Texas are upon you,
all the live-long day
The eyes of Texas are...
Badada..
Come on honey,
we got miles to go
before you'll sleep.
Next stop, Silvan Louisiana,
you're gonna meet my new
best friend.
Hell, put the hammer down, might
even make it there by midnight.
What do you think?
I think so too.
Help her!
Did you see Boone?
Where is he?
She needs a moment Chase.
What did you see?
I know, I know!
What?
I know where he's going.
I know where he's going.
You didn't really think Marcus was
going to pay his last respects, did you?
Not in the middle
of the day. No.
There is that.
- Anything else of interest?
- Yeah.
People loved this guy.
After him we knew.
I bet some of them did.
Well, she's cute.
She's pregnant.
Figures.
The question is...
with what?
Blade - 105 - The Evil Within
Krista connected.
Boone's next stop is a
small town in Louisiana.
Some place called Silvan.
Silvan?
Does that mean something?
There's a splinter faction there.
Of what House?
The House of Armaya.
Domic's faction.
You don't think Boone can really
get an audience with a Pure Blood, do you?
I'm not willing to risk it.
I want you in Silvan.
I'll send a team to meet you there.
I'm sending Krista back.
No! Use every asset.
If he gets to Domic and he discovers
what we've been doing here.
He won't.
Just kill him and come home.
I'm tying up some of Dr. Vonner's
loose ends and I'll need you
to secure them.
Krista.
How are you feeling?
Thirsty.
What?
Five hours.
You were under for 5 hours
and 9 minutes to be precise.
Until now the longest time
for a lychan blood ritual
was 27 minutes.
So after doing a little research
in the archives,
I've come to the conclusion
that there are 2
possible explanations for this.
One, you don't want
this vampire Boone found,
for either conscious
or subconscious reasons.
So you rejected the connection
for as long as possible.
Of course I want him found,
Marcus wants him get...
Or two,
you're rejecting the world of death
that Marcus and Chase have led you to.
Which would make things
very complicated.
Now, is there anything
you'd like to say?
Boone and I, we had a...
relationship.
And all that went flash.
Yes.
And that's why you've fought
the connection, because
you don't want him killed.
Yes.
Yes!
Alright then.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
She needs to rest.
She needs to go and so do I.
One more minute of listening to you
yap on about solace and serenity and
I'll ash myself.
Please.
You know...
You once were such a vampire.
I still am.
Sweetheart,
you're not even close.
Her name is Vanessa Sims.
She's 26, grew up in Cincinatti,
moved to Detroit in 98.
She does temp work, mostly
secretarial, waitressing,
all minimum wage stuff.
Married?
No, and no boyfriend
that I can see.
How do you know that?
Her movie rentals are
all chickflicks.
Hundreds of them.
That she watches on her
brand new HD plasma TV costing
over 9000 dollars,
thank you very much.
Fat pockets.
A whole lot fatter than
a few weeks ago.
You think they're paying her
to carry a vampire baby?
She's carrying something.
Yo yo, what's up, what you need,
brother, what you need?
Smoke, coke, ups, downs,
point where you want to go baby,
I'll get you there.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, oh, my man looking to get sideways.
Ok, baby, I can get that to you,
you know what I'm saying...
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
what??? What???
What, you're selling here
without my say-so?
N-no, baby, don't work that way.
You know what I'm saying?
Move!
So what? You want it, uh?
Come on!
What you got brother? Bring it.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Now! Tonight!
Let's go!
The girl is alive in there.
It's about freaking time.
You Armayans got some shit to learn about
how to treat your guest department.
I had a grandmother
that looked like you.
Had less teeth,
but still much prettier.
Yeah, that was pretty fun.
Last night she looked even better
with my dick in her rear.
And which one of you
beauty is Domic?
Mr Domic is not here.
What do you mean, he's not here?
Come on, what is this?
We will deliver the message.
So what is it?
No, no, I ain't come always to end up
with a bunch of
junior level students.
I speak to Domic and nobody else.
Aah, so now you think you're worthy
of an audience with a Pure Blood, uh?
Yeah, like that means anything.
You desorganized idiots haven't had
a seat at the table a long time, pal.
So shove your desillusions of grandeur
up your ass and go fetch Domic. Chop, chop!
Oh yeah, and tell your boss
I come bearing a nice goddamn gift.
** but her seal ain't been broken
if you get my drift.
Very considerate of you but you
know Mr Domic will still want to know
what your message is about?
What's it about?
Revenge.
Oh yeah, I've done my homework
on you Armayans.
I know all about
you backward bastards.
Sucking high in tit.
And I know that same high ranking
son of a bitch that backstabbed me
has been disappearing you guys
for the last few years.
Oh yeah, I know about that.
I know who's doing it and why.
And Domic's gonna want
to know it too.
It's time for a
little payback brother.
Let me make a call.
Get down!
Let's go!
Dust 'em all.
Boone!
Go! Go! Move!
***
Go! Move!
Go! Go!
Move, bitch!
Boone stop!
Wow, wow, wow, now look
you gotta understand.
Me and Marcus had an agreement,
but he doublecrossed me.
He threw me to the wolves, shit,
he threw me to you, you bitch!
Let her go.
Do what?
You're kidding? This meat
means something to you?
No more killing.
No more.
No more killing?
It's a tall order, sweetheart.
I'll tell you what, why don't you
suck on this instead?
No!!!
Where is Boone?
Go!
Go!
- Go!
- Shut up!
Predictable piece of shit!
Shut up! Shut up!
Come on, what do you see?
Courtesy flush.
- Boone's dead?
- Yes, no thanks to you.
Finish your little snack.
She's long gone.
Then so are we.
- Is he in?
- Yes, but, uh...
I ccompletely agree.
And if there's anything else
I can do to help,
please do not hesitate to contact.
How goes the day job?
They want another environmental impact
report on the Bristol Park project.
If you'd like I could
impact their environment.
Now you've done enough for one night.
But thank you for taking care
of our Boone problem.
Both of you.
Our little war hero
didn't miss a beat.
Expect for getting the munchies
in the middle of the fire fight.
Momentary laps.
And how is your ex-husband?
I was thinking,
if I had a little time,
I go back and castrate him.
Well, there was somewhere else
I would rather you go.
Krista, will you excuse us?
Of course.
So, where am I going?
Berlin.
I need you to safeguard
something for me.
Our future depends upon it.
Something to do with Aurora?
This goes beyond on Aurora.
What are you doing?
I'm asking you for help.
And this must remain a secret.
Or the Pure Bloods
will kill us all.
Why would they do that?
What are you planning?
I can't tell you yet.
Just know that
it is very important.
Alright.
Thank you.
Mr Van Sciver?
There's someone to see you.
No more visitors, Sabine.
Sir, it's a Pure Blood.
Chase.
Ah, this is a surprise.
Thank you, Thorne.
Charlotte, if you told me
you were coming...
You would have done everything
in your power
to make me believe I haven't
a care in the world.
Yes.
But that, as we both know,
would be just another of your
many... lies.
Son of a bitch!
You're good.
No... no I need more.
I need more.
You've had enough.
Krista.
I saw his kills... Boone!
I know.
You know what I'm feeling?
Besides guilt?
That's just it
I don't feel guilty.
What I... what I feel is...
is left out!
I'm jealous.
Cause of the way...
his freedom!
The way he can just...
he can just be and I can't.
What is happening to me?
You'll get through this.
Why, because you did?
You're half-human.
I've nothing human left.
Eyes up.
Oh, Jesus!
What can you tell me
about her?
What is it?
Her name's Vanessa.
Marcus had me deliver
something to her.
She wanted me to thank
her doctor.
Her doctor's dead.
Of course he is.
- I need to find her.
- Why?
She's pregnant.
What's that got to do
with Project Aurora?
Has Marcus ever mentioned
this place here? It's in Berlin.
Marcus just send
Chase to Berlin.
This vampire safe house must
be where she's headed.
I have people.
They tell me it's gotten busy.
Somebody just arrived that fits
Vanessa's description.
This isn't just us, is it?
What you got, some sort
of a underground network?
Do they know
I'm working for you?
Or is one of them gonna kill me one day,
thinking they're doing you a favor.
You have to be careful.
What if I kill one
of your friends?
Cost of doing business.
How close are you to getting
your hands on the Aurora vaccine?
- Krista?
- I'll get it!
There's a med lab underground,
heavily protected.
Just gotta find a way in.
Get it before
I get back from Berlin.
Aurora could change
the entire game.
We can't let that happen.
I'm never gonna see
the sunlight again, am I?
If you do, it'd the last
thing you ever see.
The wound on her neck, and where
tissue was lacerated
is consistant with an animal attack,
a wild dog maybe.
Where was she found?
Out by St. Langrish parish,
about 5 miles west of here.
A trucker found her walking
alone on the side of the road.
What's out that way?
Mostly swamp.
Did she say anything to anybody?
When they wheeled into the E.R.
she was jibber jaberish on
something about a lady helping her.
A lady?
Yeah.
Or maybe a...
a soldier, somebody with a gun,
E.M.T.s couldn't make
much sense of it
and then she lost consciouness.
Tricia?
I want you to look
at something for me.
Oh, that's not a good idea.
Here.
Right here.
- Hold on, you're upsetting her.
- You can shut up or you can leave.
No, you don't understand.
Her larynx...
What? What? This?
This right here, what...
this is what he looked like?
There's still the question of
the vaccine's long term viability.
- And Doctor Vonner's death affected us how?
- Not at all.
I'm moving forward.
When will you reach it?
5 weeks.
We'll have to accelerate
final testing.
At no additonnal cost
to the board.
But at what cost to the stability
of the Twelve Houses.
I know about Boone.
You've got a little problem there,
don't you?
Not anymore.
Boone's dead.
We got to him before
there was any trouble.
What sort of trouble might
there have been, Marcus?
Domic.
Boone gets to Domic, tells him
we've been experimenting
on his people.
Just the sort of thing, the House
of Armaya might need to turn this
into full scale war.
That didn't happen.
Not yet.
When Domic does find out what
we've been up to.
They're to fractured and desorganized
to cause any problems.
Domic didn't survive as Armaya's
last remaining Pure Blood by shutting
those beedy little eyes of his.
And it won't just be the House
of Armaya that comes after us.
At least 5 other Houses
will join them.
They don't even ever have
a seat at the council...
Armaya may be exiled but that doesn't
mean they don't have sympathisers.
And if there is a war,
we will loose,
unless Aurora works,
unless we can strike first,
in day light.
It will work.
It'd damn well better.
Well, I'm tired,
I've had a long day,
and I'd like to rest.
I thought you'd be
taking the plane back.
No Marcus, I will be
staying here tonight.
If you could have
my room prepared.
Of course.
And Marcus...
Yes.
Bring me something to eat.
Something young.
How close are you to get your
hands on the Aurora vaccine?
Just gotta find a way in.
Papers are proved and ready?
Just get 'em to Chase.
Tell her not to hurt anyone
but to make the implication clear.
Yes, Sir.
T unnels.
What is your business in Germany?
Pleasure.
You have a place in mind?
Waiting for confirmation
on the adminities.
According to my sources,
a positive Berlin institute has exactly
what you're looking for.
And to aid you in your travels.
Hey.
Good morning,
have a nice coma.
There's something wrong
with my baby?
Everything's fine.
Where am I?
You're safe, just relax.
I have to get up.
Shh, you really must relax.
Give your body a chance
to incubate your pride and joy.
Sound like a good idea,
Who are you?
The big bad wolf.
Now go back to sleep before I huff
and puff and blow your head off.
Security check, talk to me.
That's all clear.
Second floor clear.
Walk everything down.
Double check it.
Perimeter?
Perimeter is good too.
Ja, it's secured, ja.
Chase, come in,
I'm on the first fl...
It is Chase, say again?
I'm on the first floor.
No one goes in or out but me.
Who are you?
You stay away from me!
You stay away from...
Are you the devil?
Whatever works.
Goddamn it!
She wanted to see me.
Is everything alright?
It's fine Gonesse, I was just
waiting for the sunrise.
So how long has it been Gonesse?
Since you were turned.
This May, it will be 52 years.
So you must still dream of it.
Dream of what?
The sun.
I do, sometimes.
Don't feel guilty.
It's only natural.
A part of who you used to be.
I've never felt it.
Pure Bloods, born as vampires.
- We've never known day light.
- You will.
When Mr Van Sciver
delivers Aurora.
If that's even his plan.
Madam.
I believe we may have
a problem with Marcus.
Tell me what to do.
I want an internal audit,
top to bottom.
Covered investigation into everything
the House of Chthon is involved with.
Everything on the books and off.
I want phones tapped, cars tailed
and I want you to focus
on Marcus Van Sciver.
I want whoever he's turned from
the moment he first tasted blood
until now investigated.
Yes, madam.
And Gonesse, do this quietly.
Screw all of them.
Hold Krista.
You miss your world.
The one you left behind.
Yeah, and I want it back.
That's impossible.
Can come close... with this.
Doesn't work.
You're lying.
Not at the moment.
I saw Fritz.
Fritz was an unexpected and
quite frankly unwanted success.
In couple of days, he would
have started to decompose.
Is that what you want?
To die?
Don't touch me.
Aurora's effects are temporary.
It is simply a stepping stone.
To what?
A better world, for all of us.
- You mean for vampires.
- I mean for the House of Chthon.
From the dying ashes of one world,
we will emerge into better one.
You make it sound like apocalpyse.
Destruction is always required
before rebirth.
Now, you have 2 choices.
You can ever join me
in this new life.
Or you can die in your old one.
Trust me, Krista.
There is nothing left for you
but the life I can offer.
Stop fighting.
Stop wanting.
Let go and come with me.
Be with me.
Forever.
Next time on Blade...
Come on!
What did he do to you?
I'm not telling you
anything, you freak.
No! No!
Is something wrong with my baby?
Blade.
Boone is dead.
Domic learnt nothing from him.
He knows.
Charlotte!
Domic.
Armaya is back in the fold
by Friday.
All Chthon will be destroyed.

From the dying ashes of one world,
we will emerge into better one.
You make it sound like apocalpyse.
Destruction is always required
before rebirth.
Doctor Vonner? No!!!
People loved this guy.
After him we knew.
- Well, she's cute.
- She's pregnant.
The question is...
with what?
Boone gets to Domic, tells him
we've been experimenting on his people.
Just the sort of thing, the House of
Armaya might need to turn this into
full scale war.
And if there is a war,
we will lose,

- Everything's fine.
You stay away from me!
What is that?
Dinner.
Please, let me go.
When it's time.
I'll scream.
I'll stop you.
What was all that back there?
Hello, I have a right to know
what's happening to me, damn it!
Let's discuss Doctor Vonner first.
Come on, what does he have to
do with any of this?
Did you kill him?
Is this about my baby?
Is my baby ok?
Vonner, what did he do to you?
I'm not telling you anything,
you freak.
That's it.
Blade The Series - 106 - Delivery
Let's get some to my wife.
Powerful isn't it?
Those bombs even sort of sounded
like that, if that makes any sense.
Yeah.
Who painted this?
There's no signature.
Our specialist Pete Allison.
We were in the 123rd bataillon
together near Doah.
After the bomb went off, when
everybody was yelling and screaming,
at home, it must
has been his lucky day.
A week after he painted this,
he hung himself.
He'd uh, he'd only
been home a month.
I think holding on this community
landmark is essential.
This building, before it became
a glass plant for early 20th century
automobiles was a blacksmith foundry.
Turning it into a public art house
instead of tearing it down
it's not only good for people,
it's good for the soul.
Sorry.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Where's the girl?
Track her down!
Let me talk to Chase.
Is she alive?
When?
Have a full medical team ready.
- Uncle Pat!
- Buddy of mine thought
he saw you here.
- I can't talk to you right now.
- Fine, I'll talk, you'll listen.
Do you have any idea what
you're doing to your mother?
She's got a son who's dead and
a daughter who's vanished.
- God I'm not vanished!
- God knows what you're doing!
Showing up in the middle of the night,
telling her that you're avenging
- Zach's death or some kind of bullshit.
- No.
No, you got to get her help.
I've seen this before. You get back,
you think you're fine but you're not.
I know what you're going through.
You have absolutely no idea what
I'm going through.
Well, I know a couple of things.
That you're abandonning your family
- and your mother needs
you now more than ever!
- Mom is fine!
No she's not, she's not fine Krista,
she's sick!
What?
She collapsed this morning.
I took her to the hospital.
- What's wrong with her?
- We don't know yet.
- Which hospital?
- Heaven View.
Krista! Gotta go.
Hold on, buddy, I'm talking to
my niece here.
Your niece?
Pleased to meet you,
Marcus Van Sciver.
Now we would love to stay and chat,
but we just don't have the time.
Krista?
Chase?
You are home now.
You are home.
Blade.
Blade?
Yes I know.
There'll be time for him.
I want you in Berlin tonight.
What's in Berlin?
A young woman.
My property was stolen.
I want you to find her
and bring her back to me.
- Marcus...
- There is no discussion!
Go!
You know with
that baby coming...
Adams said I could get
a few extra shift.
You know what,
you get that Joe's shift
because I'm telling you, the man just
drives the paychecks away.
Sassy!
So how long until dinner?
20 minutes!
Why don't you go watch
Mannix or something?
Ok.
Just gonna go finish up outside.
Ma?
Hello, sweetie.
Now, you take those shoes off before
you track blood all over my floor.
You know, if I'd had known
what a murderer son of a bitch
you'd grow up to be.
I would have killed you in my room.
Eric, you know what you got to do!
Gut the bitch!
Let me show you how!
You always look at people like that?
Like what?
Like you want to kill them.
If I wanted you dead.
You'd be.
Small mercies.
Don't count 'em just yet.
Just excuse me
for a second.
H ey!
How is she doing?
She's asleep.
- They know what's wrong with her?
- Yeah.
Leuchimia.
Is she dying?
Doctor Westler says with a bone marrow
transplant she's got a good chance.
Of course, it's gotta come from
the family. I was no match.
You're the only family left.
I can't do it.
- What do you mean?
- I mean I can't!
What's the problem?
Hepathitis?
Something worse?
Some goddamn junk?
You smoking it?
Shooting it?
What's that Van Sciver punk
doing to you?
The Army will pay for a program,
Krista, you can get clean!
- You don't get it.
- What's not to get it, you'd rather be
an addict than help your mom!
We're family Krista.
- I'll be back.
- Krista!
What do you think it is?
My baby.
A girl or a boy?
No idea.
And I don't care.
Look, I need to go.
You're staying right here.
Then I'm pissing right here.
Hold it.
Uh, yeah.
Well, how about you punch the pregnant
lady again and see what happens?
I think we need
a new route to Paris.
- Any report from the hunters?
- They're working through Europe
city by city.
There's no sign of Blade though.
And Jakob?
Heading to Paris. He thinks that
Blade has a friend there.
Krista's on road to Berlin, send her
to Paris, tell Jakob to expect her.
Sir?
How many?
Just her.
You're borrowing or returning?
Sit please.
There.
What's on my mind, Marcus?
- I'm sure I've no idea.
- Guess!
Berlin I assume.
And I can bet what's on yours.
Chase.
Roasted and marinating in blood
from what I hear.
She's recovering quite well.
And tell me why
she was in Berlin.
What she was doing at the Malinger
Institute and why Blade showed up.
Let me add...
do... not... lie!
Inspired by my previous
assessment in Project Aurora,
Doctor Vonner's death
has ended us somewh...
Go on!
Chase was in Berlin protecting
an asset that was supposed
to further our progress.
The asset got taken.
By Blade?
You have other assets?
18, in various locations.
Blade has only compromised this one,
the others are safe.
Where are they?
I'd rather not say.
- That information is limited
to keep the assets...
- Safe.
Yes.
So many secrets.
I trust you of all people
who'd want it no other way.
You may have to share
those secrets.
With who?
The House of Armaya.
Domic.
He's requested a meeting.
He has certain informations
he would like to discuss.
To be more specific,
what he'd like to discuss
are terms.
Terms?
Could it be that Boone somehow
managed to spill the beans about our
slaughtering of Armayans for science?
Boone is dead.
- Domic learnt nothing from him.
- He knows!
Is this really the best way?
Streets aren't safe.
You know I saved your ass from
those undead freaks back there.
The least you can do is to
answer some questions!
You first.
Start with Vonner.
I met him at a free clinic
that I go to for check-ups.
He said that I was
a prime candidate,
young, healthy,
good genetic history.
He told me there were
this couple he knew.
Couldn't have kids.
I needed the money.
Screw you.
Look, I'm helping a couple that
can't have children become parents.
Think that was the idea.
Look I don't have anyone okay?
It's just, it always has been,
doing what I have to do.
I saw a way to pay some bills,
lose some debt.
What? What? Maybe I should
have been a stripper?
Doctor Vonner gave me
a better option. You know.
One that make people happy.
He lied.
Those undead freaks,
he worked for them.
They want what you have.
What?
My baby? Why?
That's what I'm going
to find out.
How? Where are we going?
To see a doctor,
someone I trust.
- To make sure everything's ok?
- That's the idea.
Donne-moi 9 mois!
Donnez 9 mois!
Allez-y!
Don't hit the pregnant lady.
Let's go.
What's wrong?
Is something wrong
with my baby?
No, no, no, no dear,
everything is fine.
Yeah, just as I thought.
Perfectly healthy.
How is it?
Allow me to consult
with my associate.
Movement.
We're going in.
Is it Blade and the girl?
If it isn't, we'll wait for him.
Just so everyone understands.
The girl is secondary.
That's what she is carrying
that we are after.
That comes with us.
Dead or alive.
Weapon check.
Marcus tells me you're a vet.
Recent?
Very.
You?
I've served my country.
Several countries over
the past few years.
Where was your first battle?
Gettysburg.
No kidding?
Blue or gray?
Both.
I found the food on both sides
of the line aqually tempting.
Whatt's your ammo?
Hallow point, silver-tipped.
Silver has no effect on Blade.
I know.
I don't know how to say this.
- Vampire?
- No.
What am I looking at?
Well, that's just it.
She's carrying
some kind of fluid.
Uh, nothing else.
Let's see it.
- Vanessa, do you what
an amniocentisis is?
- Yeah.
Uh, Doctor Vonner checked out
some fluid last week.
Everything was fine.
What's wrong?
What's wrong with my baby?
Who is it?
Open it.
Oh my god!
Hi.
I'm here to kill you, kill Blade
and take the girl back to Marcus.
Like that's ever gonna happen.
Bonjour.
Marcus sent you?
Me and a team.
Where are they?
I had them first.
Excusez-moi, I need a drink.
Hello Vanessa.
I know you.
You worked for Doctor Vonner.
You're with the freaks.
Not exactly.
I'm one.
Word of advice, Marcus.
Don't speak to Domic
unless spoken to you.
You're not his favorite person
these days.
Charlotte!
Domic!
Your protégé has done quite well
for himself.
You know,
back in the day, I used to be
in the gladiator business.
Nothing like a good
blood sport, yes?
What are we talking about?
Well, why don't we start with the vaccine,
you've been making with the blood
of my people.
What's the cute name Marcus
gave it? Aurora.
I can't imagine many tears
being shed over the demise of
a thousand or so Armayans.
Can you imagine what the reaction
will be when they'll learn that
the House of Chthon, the high
and mighty Chthon
who styled themselves the leader
of the vampire nation,
the tireless support for the peace
between the Twelve Houses
has secretly been
developping a vaccine
that would give them,
and only them
total superiority over the
rest of their vampire brathering.
What do you want?
In.
You want immunity?
Yes.
Immunity.
And amnesty.
It is time for our exile to come
to an end as well.
The House of Armaya demands
full inclusion back into the
governing body.
That's impossible!
You tried to destroy us.
The folly of youth.
You've been keeping the Houses
in line for over a hundred years.
They'll listen to you.
And what you are going to say,
is "we welcome back Armaya
with open arms
and Domic, Domic deserves his rightful
place along side his fellow
Pure Bloods."
Just to be clear,
this is blackmail.
It's justice!
And in the events of
my untimely death
I have certain document detailing
your transgrations against m...
- I get it!
- Good.
When would you like this done?
Within the week.
I'll need more time.
You don't have it.
Armaya is back in
the fold by Friday.
Or by Saturday.
Chthon will be destroyed.
Domic!
How did you find out?
His name is Sands,
luckily for me.
He survived your funny games.
Mr Van Sciver, if I could just
say one thing.
Go to hell.
All of you.
Like life ain't hard enough,
we got you bastards
pushing your goddamn chess pieces
all over the goddamn board!!!
Lost pawns are sick of it.
You have my number.
You know he won't stop.
He'll keep wanting more.
Yes.
Like someone else I know.
How are you doing?
Sleepy.
Just close your eyes,
it will be over soon.
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.
I know.
I just wanted to have a baby.
What's inside me?
I don't know, sweetheart.
We're gonna get it out, ok?
You... are going to feel a tug.
Ok.
You're doing ok, you're doing ok.
It will be fine.
You're ok, you're ok.
I wanna kill them,
I wanna kill them for
what they've done!
They're gonna pay, they will.
They die too fast.
They need to suffer.
I know.
Do you even feel pain?
I want them to feel pain for
what they've done!
We do.
My little man.
Marcus had
incubated something.
Some sort of biological substance.
Is she alright?
She'll never have children.
I was forced to remove
compromised tissue, a lot of it.
I don't know what the long term
effects might be.
She's sleeping.
What happens now?
I'll figure out what this is.
Well, I gotta get this back to Marcus,
it's what he sent me here for.
Not all of it.
I need a sample.
And Vanessa?
She goes underground.
Get her as far away from me
as possible.
Blade, this isn't about Aurora.
Marcus is up to something else.
It could be even
something worse,
- I don't know...
- Later.
You know,
she has his mother's name.
Is she ready?
One moment.
It is time to go.
Don't be afraid, Vanessa.
You will be safe.
Where am I going?
I don't know.
And you won't know to, until
you'll get there.
As far as anyone else is concerned,
you are dead.
No one will come looking for you.
Come, you're free.
Like, I can't go home, ever.
No, no, no, you must very careful.
Many people have risked everything.
To make sure you and others like
you remain hidden from them. Here!
Tell them I said thank you,
tell them both.
If I see them again, yes.
I will do so.
Au revoir.
I'm done, I can't do this anymore.
I want out.
We're doing a good thing here.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Yes, you could have,
you don't need me.
What I need is more.
Information.
Locations, photographs,
plans, names...
- Oh, I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.
You're inside,
don't give up now.
This never gonna end, is it?
Marcus is expecting that.
This is all of it?
I got what I need.
What?
I oughta walk back into Chthon
and tell Marcus yet
another one of his assassination
squad has been wiped out.
You got away and Vanessa is dead.
Yet, somehow I wound up walking away
with whatever was inside of her?
Uh, he ain't buying that.
What are you suggesting?
I'm in a war.
With you.
I better look like it.
Collins?
So, I haven't heard from you
in the last 3 days.
Crime's still running.
That's not your problem,
Louisiana 's got that.
We're all done.
Get on the plane and come home!
You came back to early,
you weren't ready.
But you're not hearing me.
I'm gonna make this real simple,
you're relieved, you're completely
off this now!
Nat, look, I think...
I think I'm looking for a...
a monster.
Yeah, they're all monsters,
let someone else do it.
I have to do this!
Ray, I'm shit serious now,
this is not about
Sarah and Johanna,
if you try to work something out
you do it on the couch with Dr Bishop.
Do not screw up your carrier
over this now!
Just go home!
Sorry.
I'm sorry I lost the prize.
It's ok.
Krista's on the job.
Like I said...
I'm sorry.
Domic's weight in.
He knows.
He wants to enter exile
Heard of Aurora and he is forcing
Charlotte to plead his case to
the Pure Bloods.
He's humiliating her.
She doesn't see it that way.
You're humiliating her.
Sir, Krista's back.
Thank you.
I gotta go.
You rest.
She tells me you had a
qualified success.
What happened?
Blade happened.
Jakob and the rest of the team?
Gone.
Vanessa?
Disemboweled.
I salvaged what I could.
Blade got nothing.
You're certain?
Good.
There was no child.
What she was carrying
was more valuable than life.
Death?
We'll see.
If that's all,
I'd like to get to medical.
Of course.
Krista!
Excellent work.
I have great plans
for you in the future.
Happy to hear it.
Next time on Blade.
Donny?
Looks like your past is
only coming back to haunt you.
***, it's about me.
Derek?
Dad.
- Something's happening to me?
- Yeah, son.
He's going to find out what
he is soon enough.
I'm his father, I'll handle it.
We can stay together for a while.
We can stay together forever
if you want.
Mr Brooks?
Yeah.
I'm here about the boy.
I'm Abraham Whistler.

- Your mother needs you
now more than ever!
- Mom is fine!
She's not fine Krista,
she's sick!
What's wrong with her?
Blade.
Blade? Yes I know.
I want you in Berlin tonight.
- What's in Berlin?
- My property was stolen.
I want you to find her
and bring her back to me.
- Silver has no effect on Blade.
- I know.
I'm in a war. With you.
I better look like it.
- What happened?
- Blade happened.
I salvaged what I could.
Blade got nothing.
We reached out to help you.
You bit us for it.
You were killers way
before I even met you.
Another time, little man.
Hello, Donny.
Looks like your past is...
finally coming back to haunt you.
What do you want from me?
This!
Did you call your friend at the CDC?
When did I become your secretary?
You wanna dial her up,
just hit that key, right there.
I *** the choice to fill.
I don't do this.
That's cause I do everything.
Didn't fix the AC
in the car yet.
Maybe you should look into
getting the bad-ass summer-weight coat.
Hey, you gotta stop biting me,
- I'm going as fast...
- Do you know what it is?
Like I said before,
not completely.
You got the sample 3 days ago.
Yeah, and I got access
to CDC computers 9 hours ago.
You're stressing everybody, dude.
What have you learned in 9 hours?
Ok, I think it's a key hole virus.
- A key hole virus?
- Yeah.
A virus targeted
at a specific DNA sequence.
So, it's targeted at one person?
People, I think, a race maybe,
even a species.
Human or vampire?
Working on that now.
When will you know?
I'll call you when I have something.
Later.
First Marcus is trying to make
vampires immune to their weaknesses.
And now, he's trying to make
a virus that wipes out, what?
If your girlfriend worked faster,
we'd know.
Can I make a suggestion?
Take a walk.
I hear the houseware
on the fifth floor is wide open,
with nothing but
dark empty space. Go chill.
What's that?
A name just tripped the system.
Donny Flanigan.
What happened to him?
He died...
oddly.
Went down a few minutes ago.
He was an ex-cop.
Blade?
Who is it?
Blade The Series - 107 - Sacrifice
Mom? Hold on, they're here.
She has leuchimia, stage 4.
It's chronic lymphocytic.
She's on Pyridazine,
Dolasetron and Predozon.
Mom? The ambulance is here ok?
No hospital.
She's been coughing up blood
for the past 15 minutes.
Let's go, let's go!
Krista, I'm not going to the hospital.
- I want to stay here.
- No, Mom, you're not staying here.
Krista, I'm not dying in a hospital.
They can do what they need to here.
I'm not leaving my home.
Krista?
Krista?
Right now, the best thing
for her is to do what she wants.
Right now, the best thing
for her is to stay alive.
That's not gonna happen Krista.
We  gotta let her go.
No, we don't.
Radio made it sound like
crime scene techs
will be here in 15.
We don't have much time.
When I'll clear the room,
you'll be in there. Ok?
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to clear this room.
I need a minute alone
to process this.
Ok.
This is going to come up a suicide.
We'll see. I'm sorry did you know him?
Yeah.
Ok guys, let's go!
This wasn't a suicide.
Gun hand's broken.
He was a cop,
maybe he had ennemies.
You knew him?
Yeah.
Eric Brooks, how you doin' kid?
- Hey Flanigan.
- You feeling better?
Sleepy.
That's what you get for running
into the countryside, uh?
Viola is gonna get you all fixed up.
Make a fist, honey.
Hey, I brought you some uh,
some comic books.
All *** heroes.
- The Avengers.
- Yeah, you bet!
Gonna have a lot of holes in you.
That's for sure.
No.
Viola says that I'm healing.
That's right.
Hole today, gone tomorrow.
Hey you just lay back
and get some rest.
And I'll check on that
in a couple of hours.
Ok.
You stay cool, ok buddy?
No  more funny stuff now,
you hear? You rest.
Yes, Daddy.
Thanks Donny and Viola.
- I don't know how he's doing it.
- He's a kid.
Sneaking out is what kids do.
No, it's like he's a ghost.
Yeah, well, at least we know
he is not a ghost.
Robert, I'm having
a problem at work.
They're getting suspicious
about the blood.
I  don't think I can keep up
these deliveries.
You just start tapping me again.
We can't do that forever!
What about the guy at
the slaughter house?
- The cow blood was...
- No!
This stuff just made him sick.
Can we talk about
this professor Caylo guy?
I mean, he knows people,
people who might be able to,
I don't know, talk...
Come on! He's just some crazy
asshole movie freak.
He's gonna tell you my son is
some kind of monster.
Robert, he's not going
to be a boy forever.
You can not keep him locked up.
Out of school,
away from the world!
He's going to find out
what he is soon enough.
And how are you
going handle that?
I'm is father.
I'll handle it.
Blade?
There's something in his mouth.
What's that about?
It's about me.
Does that hurt?
No.
Cover the other eye please.
Good.
Can you read that?
There's nothing on it.
Ultraviolet spectrum.
It's a glyph from
one of the Houses.
M-mmh, Armaya.
You should know that.
I do.
Look I'm fine, can I go?
Your arm isn't fine
but it's healing.
Wear these until
you don't need them anymore.
I heal from everything.
Except the silver stake
through the head.
Too much exposure to the sun.
Garlic, but I guess you know
all those rules by now.
Yeah.
What if I was sick before
I was turned?
I've seen cases of MS
cured over night.
Cripples walk again.
Mortality and immunity.
That's why some of the familiars
are so desperate to be turned.
I got to go!
Where to?
Chase, I haven't seen you
in a while.
Butterfly isn't ready to emerge yet.
How are you feeling Krista?
I'm thirsty.
You haven't been drinking enough.
You'd be healing faster if you had.
- Why don't we take you down
to the feeding room?
- No!
I need to get out.
I want a fresh kill.
Maybe I'll come with you.
We had fun, didn't we, last time?
Actually, Chase, I need you
for something else.
Happy hunting.
What do you have
in store for me?
The details are there,
but in general terms.
Per our agreement.
The money we fronted Marcus to
produce the Aurora vaccine
it's been laundered through his
legitimate businesses.
Dispersed through the global network
of harvesters.
The money went nowhere else?
Not that I can see.
He's either a very good boy or
he's very good at covering his tracks.
No evidence of a side project.
Or something we didn't contract for?
Not so far. I still have
two investigators in the field.
How soon before we get Aurora?
Madam, I'm not sure
Aurora will ever be delivered.
Or if it is, it will make us
immune to our weaknesses.
And why is that?
Marcus has shut down all the facilities
except one outside Reno, Nevada.
Per our arrangement with Domic.
Aramayans are being delivered
but soon after their arrival
they're being destroyed.
Prior to testing.
It seems so.
So Marcus is making theater.
Trying to delay us?
Or distract us.
From what?
From whatever Berlin was perhaps.
I would like more time
to investigate Marcus' women.
Chase? She's been with him
for years.
No, the new girl. Krista.
Marcus killed her brother a few
days before she fell into Chthon.
Killing a sibbling is a common lure.
I've used it myself.
Still there's something off.
Something of influence
that I can't quite see.
Alright. Investigate.
Now, did you bring me
what I asked for?
Lovely.
Gonesse, you never disappoint.
Oh, look at you.
I could just eat you up!
Yes I could, yes I could.
I smell blood.
Who was he?
A friend.
Check.
Take a moment now.
I've been taken a lot of moments.
In this moment you'll see
the trap I leave for you.
I saw it.
You don't see my way out.
I got you beat.
What?
Do you see it?
You knew where I was going?
Because I was thinking like you.
What were you thinking like?
Shining knight on a powerful
horse riding to the rescue?
Learn to think like your opponent.
Or lose every time.
Checkmate!
I have to say you had worried.
For a while there.
Yeah, you bet I did.
E ric?
Mr. Brooks?
Mr. Taka please,
just stay out of this.
Eric, get up. Get over here.
Eric?
Eric?
Dad?
I don't feel so good.
It's uh...
It's gonna be ok, just uh,
we'd better go home, come on,
let's go.
I was playing the game.
There'll be other games here.
Let's go.
Shen?
I'm awake.
Find Viola.
I'm working on it.
Any guesses as to
who's done this?
A few.
You wanna share?
Not yet.
Now focus.
I am focused.
As focused as I've ever been.
Got something.
What?
Viola Watkins,
changed her name in 1981.
To what?
I, uh... I don't know yet.
Why you think
she changed her name?
I'm sure she had her reasons.
Dad?
Yeah, son.
Is something happening to me?
Yeah. There is.
What  are you gonna do?
I'm gonna help you, I am.
We're gonna fix this together.
You and me.
Why?
Am I broken?
No.
Just special.
We just gotta be extra careful.
You said there was somebody.
Somebody who could help.
Yeah, I got a name.
It's a guy who's had experience
with this sort of things, but...
well, would you got
to know something...
What?
If you do this,
everything is gonna be different,
I mean, forever.
Alright.
What's his name?
Mr. Brooks?
Yeah.
I'm here about the boy.
I'm Abraham Whistler.
These would be the only things
that could stop him
if he was a true vampire.
But he ain't.
So what is he?
He's a Daywalker.
Born of a woman who was bitten
but not yet turned.
In time he will come to possess
all their strenghs
but none of their weaknesses.
When will that happen?
As soon as he starts
feeling thirst.
Something neither he nor you
will be able to control.
What he is trying
to tell you, Robert...
Your boy is unstoppable.
But he's not like the others.
And he's not even a Pure Blood.
And what the hell is a Pure Blood?
Born vampires.
They're the elite, the rules
of the Houses,
everything, power, influence, evil...
Flows from them down to the ***.
***.
But your son is different.
It will be a force to be reckoned with.
So what do you want
to do with him?
Enlist him in the fight.
They're giving us a weapon.
We can either use it or kill it.
So you want my son to help you.
Start some kind of war.
You're not listening to me.
War is already raging.
Your boy is at a crossroads.
Now he's tasted blood.
He's got to killer insticts now.
At this moment, we can decide
who he's gonna destroy.
Innocent people?
Or those responsible for his pain.
And yours.
What?
Eric?
Eric?
Eric???
Mr. Taka?
Mr. Taka?
Mr Taka?
Quit making so much noise, man!
Just open the safe.
Come on, come on!
Hurry up, old man.
I ain't gonna say it again.
Look, listen to me!
If this thing ain't
open in 3 seconds,
my  boy here is gonna
cut your heart out, alright?
Leave him alone!
Eric! No!
Pit, he's gonna look!
No!
What have you done?
Dad?
Oh my god...
Step aside, Mr. Brooks.
I'm ok, I'm ok.
You said me and you
would get through this.
You lied.
You don't want me anymore.
Eric.
No Eric, stop!
Oh my god!
Oh Eric.
I'm gonna find her.
Can I ask you a question?
What?
Since you mom passed away,
was your dad and Viola...
Yes.
Maybe he's a target of all this.
He's not.
Uh, you're sure?
He's dead, I'm sure.
Got it.
Names and addresses...
Place and employment.
Set the alarms.
Let's go.
What's her name?
Sally Porter.
Oh yeah sir,
do you have an appointment?
Yes.
She was going to give me
a tour of the facilities.
For my mother.
Oh yeah absolutely,
you know give me one second
and I'll just track her down for you.
I'm Sally Porter.
How can I help you?
Hi.
How she's doing now?
She's doing ok.
She's been talking about you.
You have a birthday coming in?
No, I don't.
It's the morphine.
She thinks you're gonna be 6.
She's been shopping.
A music box.
Yeah.
I still have it.
Look, if you wanna go,
I can stay until, uh,
just before dawn and
if you can get another nurse.
Yeah, the day shift nurse,
I can get her here by 5.
Thanks.
Right, have a good night.
Can I, can I ask you how long?
Well, it's difficult to say.
It might be 2 days, I wouldn't say
more than a week. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Thanks for everything.
Hey!
You're gonna be late.
You can't afford to be late.
Late for what?
For school.
You better go or
you're gonna miss the bus.
It's not a school day.
It isn't?
Well, then.
Why don't you sit here with me?
We can stay together for a while.
We can stay together forever
if you want.
Would you like that?
Honey...
that would be wonderful.
Sally Porter? Where is she?
She's giving a tour...
Boy, that is some serious bling
you got getting on there.
Where is she?
Down in rehab.
This isn't good.
Come on, Viola!
Come on back!
Eric?
Oh my god! Oh my god!
Are you alright?
No, no, he's killing everyone!
Do you know who it is?
- He had these...
- Steppin' Razor!
Do you know where he's going?
Home, your home.
He's going to kill your father.
Viola, my father's dead.
No, honey...
he's not.
He came back to town 2 months ago.
He's here because of you.
Stay with her.
I was wondering
when you'd turned up.
Well, you'll stop wondering.
You killed him too?
I wouldn't had to if you'd gotten
your stories straight.
You said your daddy been shot,
you saw him die.
That's what I saw.
Uh, I think that's what you hoped.
The good thing is his girlfriend
was a nurse.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Out to lunch, gone fishing.
That doesn't matter now,
does it?
It's just you and me now.
Another second, it'll just be me.
Sure.
You know if you ask me...
he's been keeping an eye on you.
You hit Detroit.
And guess what?
He shows up, he...
He kinda gets me.
Right here.
Just like old times, uh?
Hello, son.
They're dead, Flanigan, Taka...
He did that?
Viola?
She's alive.
You saved her.
Son?
There's some things we need
to talk about.
I'm not interested!
Eric, you got to know,
I was never ever gonna let you go!
You're not a monster, you're...
you're my son.
Not anymore.
You couldn't accept me.
What could I do, tell me right now,
tell me, what the hell could I do?
Go to hell!
Eric...
That's not my name!
And you're not my father!
He was the vampire who
attacked my mother.
You just the guy who was
stuck holding a bag.
Please, please...
If you wanna live,
get as far away
from me as possible!
Mr. Gerrard,
I'd like to talk to you.
So when did my nephew's murder
become a federal case?
It hasn't.
I'm looking for your niece, Krista.
Why? What's she done?
Nothing that I know of.
You know where I can find her?
No, I don't.
I mean she's here in Detroit but uh,
I don't know where she's staying.
I called her mother's house,
I spoke to the nurse.
You did what?
- I understand the situation...
- Yeah, well maybe, you don't.
Krista has pretty much checked
out of this family.
After his brother Zack was killed,
she kinda went off the rails.
She's hanging out with
a different crowd now.
What kind of crowd?
Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver?
No, who he is?
This town's answer to Donald Trump.
So what Krista is doing with him?
God only knows.
Oh, there's my sweetheart.
Hey, mom.
Do you know how much I love you?
I think so.
Mom, I don't want you to go.
I have to.
There's nothing more we can do.
Yes, there is.
What is that?
It's medecine.
But I can't give it to you yet.
We have to do something first.
What do we have to do?
It's gonna hurt.
But only for a minute.
And then what?
Then you won't feel anything.
And when you wake up,
I can give you this.
And we can be together forever.
That's nice.
Honey!
Honey, what are you doing?!
No!
I love you, mom!
Wasn't that touching?
- Give it back.
- Don't waste your breath!
I've been following you all night.
Mr. Van Sciver will be interested
to know that you have somehow
required a large stash of...
What is this exactly?
FBI, hold it!
Oh shit!

What did you do to me ?
I injected you with a serum,
to get you thinking straight.
Aurora's effects are temporary.
It is simply a stepping stone.
To what?
A better world, for all of us.
I believe we may have
a problem with Marcus.
Tell me what to do.
I think I'm looking for a monster.
They're all monsters,
let someone else do it.
Is she dying?
With a bone marrow transplant
she's got a good chance.
I can't do it.
- What do you mean?
- I mean I can't!
It's medecine.
But I can't give it to you yet.
We have to do something first.
Then we can be together forever.
No! No!
Mr. Van Sciver will be interested
to know that you have somehow
required a large stash of...
What is this exactly?
FBI, hold it!
Oh shit!
You got the serum from
the Daywalker, didn't you?
You work for him?
How unlucky for you!
Take your last breath,
you traitorous bitch!
Silver, mirrors are backed with it,
didn't you know that?
Good bye.
What the hell is...?
Hold it!
You need to get out of my way.
What are you?
Krista?
Blade The Series - 108 - Turn of the Screw
We should do something
about that.
Blade?
It'll heal.
It always does.
You're going after him?
Who?
Your father.
Man, I...
I'd do anything to get
my old man back.
Difference between
you and me.
- Look, I'm just saying...
- I need serum.
Shen.
What was she doing?
I was under the impression Van Sciver
was serious about this venture.
He wouldn't have sent me out here,
if he wasn't.
He's offering me 4 million dollars
less than he promised
don't come to my club
and give me blue balls.
He's giving you 2 million
over the market price.
Marcus considers this
a personal favor.
Really?
If he wants to play in Vegas,
he'll pony up.
He has 2 days before
I move on to another buyer.
- Mr. Taylor...
- And you tell Marcus
next time he wants to screw me,
he should do it face to face.
Shawn?
Do you know who that is?
She's from *** on business.
Tell me where she's staying.
- Someone got dusted.
- Krista?
I doubt it.
Cytoxin?
That's a chimio therapy drug.
Her mother has cancer?
Had.
So when did she die?
Probably after Krista
stole my serum.
She turned her mother.
That's what it looks like.
I can't find her.
Help me.
What's this?
Well, I saw you in that club,
and you looked uh, lonely.
And you want to what?
Keep me company?
Sure, why not?
You look good, Chase.
That's the best you could do,
after what, 60 years?
63,
but who's counting?
Apparently, you are.
I've waited for you, you know.
All night.
And then, every night after that,
for months.
Surrounded by your fair share of
champagne and starlets I'm sure.
And I'd given 'em all up,
if you had left Marcus.
Let's leave the past
where it belongs.
You're here now.
Yes, I am.
She was dying.
That's what humans do.
Who shot you?
I don't know.
I think he was a cop.
A cop?
I've never seen him before.
Who did you ash?
Some woman,
she came after me.
From Chthon?
No, I don't know!
- But she saw you, with serum.
- I took care of it!
You know, my mother is out there
somewhere and we got to find her.
Did you inject her before
she went out the window?
Did you?
- We have to take care of this.
- What does that mean?
Blade.
The serum worked for her,
I mean it kept her
thinking straight.
Maybe it's not too late
for her mother.
Give her your jacket.
Where was she going?
I don't know.
Some place she thinks it's safe.
Where would that be?
Oh no!
Lisa?
Pat?
Before Vegas, it was in Hong Kong.
Before that, Rio.
Been traveling for a while,
trying to get some distance.
From what?
The House of Erebus is becoming
increasingly conservative.
Claiming in the old ways,
the old laws...
The other Pure Bloods,
they're afraid.
Of what?
Losing their grip.
And you're not?
Well, I've never had
a grip on anything.
I beg to differ.
Yes.
But you got away,
didn't you?
You're a Pure Blood.
You were born a vampire,
and I was turned.
I'm unworthy.
Come on, Chase,
that is so old world.
It's not me anymore.
You're still with Marcus?
Of course.
But is he with you?
Your master's voice.
Excuse me.
Hello, Marcus.
You didn't close the deal?
No, it didn't go well.
Nothing has since Berlin.
What's wrong with you, Chase?
You said you were ready
to come back to work.
- I am.
- Let me talk to that prick.
So what's the problem?
Taylor is playing hardball,
he won't budge on the price.
You assured me you could do this.
Do I need to send someone else
out there who can make this happen?
No, I'll get it done.
The clock is ticking.
- I thought you were his favorite.
- Things change.
Let me guess...
Tall, brown hair.
How did you know?
When things get stressful, Marcus
reverts to his old bad habits.
What does that mean?
His wife.
Tall...
brown hair...
Really quite the beauty,
until she wasn't, but I guess
we all have our weaknesses, uh?
- I didn't know he was married.
- Oh yeah.
A long time ago,
it didn't end well.
Then again,
what does?
I have missed you.
I haven't thought of you once.
Maybe it's time
for you to get out.
Maybe it's time
for you to shut up!
Close the deal and get out.
I will, I have to.
What are you up to, Chase?
I need change.
What do you mean?
Vegas. I could leave Detroit.
Run things from out here.
Put a little space between
Marcus and I.
What for?
Is he hurting you?
No.
Not yet.
It's complicated.
Alright.
Then what is Taylor asking for?
Four million.
It's a drop in the bucket for
a guy like Marcus.
I think he wants me to fail.
Why?
I almost died in Berlin.
Blade.
I got burned.
I think Marcus
lost faith in me.
All he needs is an excuse
to replace me.
Then he's a goddamn fool.
Lisa?
Lisa.
I called the house
but nobody's there.
Nobody's answering.
Is the nurse there?
Lisa?
You chill to the bone.
Do you wanna go
to the hospital?
Alright, alright...
Well, let me
take you home.
I don't want
to go back there.
I don't feel very well.
What the hell is that?
Ok, I'm gonna call 911.
Come on, pick up
that goddamn phone.
I think I need
something to eat.
Please hang up,
and try your call again.
Please hang up now,
this is a recording.
Please hang up, and tr...
Krista.
Oh no!
No!
Is he dead?
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Make it sure he stays that way.
Where will she go now?
I don't know.
- Think.
- I don't know!!!
They are all dead!
My entire family is...
dead.
Not yet.
But the sun is coming up soon.
Let's go.
She's hanging out with
a different crowd now.
Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver?
Van Sciver Incorporated,
how can I direct your call, hello?
Hello?
Krista.
All you have to do is die.
Welcome to the family.
Family?
Hey, is somebody down there?
I didn't see you sign in.
Hey?
Is this somebody in here?
You're beautiful.
You already have me in bed.
You can stop.
No, please continue.
It's a hell of a show.
Marcus?
Get dressed. We're leaving.
Wow, no!
Wait.
You don't wait,
you don't listen to him!
You get up and you get dressed now
or I will kill you
before you take another breath.
You were here to close a deal,
not to whore yourself out
to a degenerate Pure Blood.
Wouldn't you rather just,
cut the insults and rip my throat out.
Oh that's right you can't,
because I am a Pure Blood.
And what are you?
You're just...
infected. Which is all
you'll ever be.
Doing our biddings, serving our will.
Yeah.
Vampires like you it's...
nothing but pieces of meat.
They got a reprieve.
Thank you of
reminding me of that.
Chase?
Chase?
It's getting dark.
It's time to go.
Where?
To the cemetary.
Your brother's grave.
My dead brother
is not the problem.
Your mother is.
She might be dropping by
just to say hello.
Mothers are like that.
So we're gonna go stake out
a cemetary?
Until you come over
with something better.
A.D.E.
What?
- After Death Experience...
- I know what it is.
My mom had one
when I turned her.
Which means she saw you
being turned.
By Marcus.
At the House of Chthon.
She's probably looking for me there.
Please, please help me!
I need to see my daughter. I...
Sorry, sir.
She came out of nowhere.
Not a problem. Happens
from time to time. Is she?
Infected...
Lane, this is Leon.
I've got a stray in the lobby
who needs an immediate
transportation to disposal.
Ma'am,
if you'd like to accompany
these gentlemen through that door,
I'll see to it that you receive
all the attention you deserve.
I want my daughter,
where is my daughter?
Ma'am, we're gonna
take care of you.
I want my daughter.
Agent Collins,
Mr. Van Sciver will see you now.
Will you follow me?
Sure, thank you.
My mom is in that ambulance,
let's go!
What can I do for the FBI?
Well, I'm just following up on a case.
What do you know about
a young man named Zack Starr?
That name isn't familiar.
What about Krista Starr?
- His wife?
- Sister.
I'm sorry, what is this about?
Zack Starr was murdered
and the case was being handled
by a local detective,
a cop named Brian Boone.
Looks like Krista Starr was involved
in the investigation.
- Well, have you talked to her?
- No, she's missing.
You wouldn't know where I could
find her by any chance, would you?
- Do you say Boone?
- Yeah.
Is this the same detective
who is being accused of
this cross country killing spree?
Yeah.
And you're handling that case.
Well, it might be tied
to the Starr murder.
You think it might be 2 murders,
him and his sister?
No.
She isn't dead.
In fact,
her uncle saw her recently,
just doesn't know how
to get ahold of her.
- You spoke to the uncle?
- Uh-uh.
And he tells me that you and Krista
know each other pretty well.
Tell me...
- Do you understand british
divorce courts, Mr. Collins?
- Sorry.
UK law,
elementary requirements.
Not at all.
My situation is such that
discretion in this case
with this single young woman
is both financially
and publically essential.
So you, you do know
about Zack Starr?
I'm afraid so. Yes.
Only what Krista told me over
the pillow, so to speak.
How did you two meet?
Social function.
I was at a gallery opening,
she walked in, and, I noticed.
It happened like that.
Did it?
So can you tell me
where she is now?
No.
I haven't seen her
in a few days.
And to be quite honest,
she finds me,
I don't have a number
or an address,
- just a willingness
to see whenever she gets...
- ...bitch.
I tell you what.
If you meet me at
this park,
I've got a meeting downtown, I'll...
have some of my people
dig her up for you.
I'm sorry, poor choice of words,
but I'm sure once I get them onto it.
I'll be able to tell you
exactly where she's been found.
Now if there's nothing else,
I think we're done here.
There is one more thing,
Mr. Van Sciver.
Do you know what
this symbol is?
Should I?
That wasn't my question.
No.
I don't know what it is.
Do you?
Not yet.
Now we are done here.
I apologize again.
For what?
Keeping me waiting or
lying to me?
Both.
Good evening.
Sabine will show you out.
Picked the wrong House
to crash, Ma'am.
Chthon is pretty picky.
I was looking for my daughter.
She was there.
A lot of people
pass through them, Ma'am.
What's that?
An extract of garlic.
I'd say this is gonna hurt
a little but I'd be lying.
I've always hated garlic.
This will be the last time
you'll be able to smell it.
I promise.
Oh my god, mom!
What are you doing?
Get out of the way.
You're gonna have to kill me first,
you son of a bitch.
Blade.
Krista?
Mum, we're gonna
get you out of here.
I'm a little busy, sweetheart.
Mom, look at me!
You've to come with me now!
Right now!
What, what have you done to me?
I'm gonna tell, I'll talk about that.
Just...
give me your hand.
Come on.
Come on.
Alex.
What are you doing here?
Getting you out.
Please?
Here is a... cashier's check
for 4 million dollars.
It's what you need to get
that property from Taylor.
- And you want in on the deal?
- No.
I only want Chase.
Alex,
you do know that relationships
between Pure Bloods and non
Pure Bloods is frowned upon.
To speak nothing of a...
financial arrangement between
Erebus ans the House of Chthon...
Trust me.
No one knows I'm here, this is
strictly between you and me. So...
take the money,
buy whatever you want,
but let Chase go.
You're buying me.
I'm rescuing you.
There's a difference.
Yes, there is.
You're right.
Since Berlin,
I'm just not the same.
Fine, go.
Let me say goodbye properly.
Pour us a drink, Chase.
Let's toast to our new lifes.
To endings and beginnings.
Sorensen?
- You're a long way from home, Ray.
- Yes, so are you.
But I'm not the one
who's been ruffling feathers.
Where did you hear that?
I got a call from
Director Hendricks
who heard of a Michigan senator
who was responding to a call
from a local mover and shaker.
Marcus Van Sciver.
Is that the guy you've been
accusing of killing people?
I didn't accuse him of anything.
But this has to do with that local cop
that you've been chasing.
Starts there, I don't know
where it's gonna end.
It's gonna end right here, Ray.
Right here.
It's time to fold up the tent,
people are tired of the sideshow, Ray.
You're asking for my gun?
Do I have to ask?
- Do you have a spare?
- No.
I'm gonna believe that.
Is there something else?
What?
Van Sciver isn't human.
Ok Ray, I've gonna get...
No, you have to believe me,
I've seen things.
- I don't buy this...
- No, listen to me!
There's a conspiracy here.
And it goes way back.
I, I'm not sure who it involves,
but these...
these people, these things...
Hey, I'm gonna
make you promise,
hey look at me,
look at me in my eyes!
We're gonna go home,
you're gonna get to talk to...
I'm not talking to another doctor!
Talk to Hendricks.
If you believe this,
whatever it is,
and I don't bring it forward
in this day and age...
I'm not willing take that risk.
You've shitting me right?
I've known you too long.
Thank you.
There's a flight at 7.30 am.
- You got a hotel here, right?
- Yeah.
I'll pick you up first thing.
We're gonna figure this out,
Ray, you and me.
We're gonna gat all this squared away.
This ***.
Where I am ?
You are where you need to be, honey.
You don't have to this, Chase.
This is the only way
to ensure the project success.
What project?
What are you talking about?
What is he doing?
Chase?
It's ok.
Don't worry about what he's doing.
What is that?
What is he doing?
Marcus?
Marcus?
It's just an experiment.
But one I'm sure will work.
Ready.
You're sure about this, Chase?
I've nothing but faith in you.
Chase?
What's happening?
Deep breaths.
What are you doing?
Giving you the chance to prove
that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.
Pure Bloods could die,
and that we, the infected ones,
will be the ones
to take you all down.
I... I... I thought
you loved me.
I do.
For everything you've just done
for Marcus and I.
Who is infected now?
I know it hurts, mom.
- Please don't!!!
- I can't.
Stop it you bitch!
It has to work right?
Tell me it's gonna work!
I'm so thristy!
I can smell him, he's right there.
I'm so thirsty, honey, please!
Why isn't this working?
She's fed to many times,
she's been turned for too long.
Let me out!!!
What can I do?
You can let me do it.
Mom!
Krista?
I'm sorry.

Previously on Blade
We can stay together for a while.
We can stay together
forever if you want.
What are you doing?!
- She turned her mother.
- That's what it looks like.
Boone is dead.
- Domic learnt nothing from him.
- He knows!
Charlotte!
Domic!
Armaya is back in the fold by Friday.
Or Chthon will be destroyed.
Silver, mirrors are backed with it.
What is this?
Sex trade, illegal body parts,
I've never seen this before.
Van Sciver isn't human.
- I've gonna get...
- No, you have to believe me,
I've seen things.
- I don't buy this...
- No, listen to me!
And what are you?
You're just... infected.
You're nothing but pieces of
meat that got a reprieve.
Chase, what are you doing?
Giving you the chance to prove
that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.
Pure Bloods could die, and that we,
the infected ones, will be
the ones to take you all down.
Who is infected now?
I'm so thirsty, honey!
She's fed to many times,
she's been turned for too long.
Mom!
Krista?
I'm sorry.
Slow down, sweetheart.
Then again, everyone
who loved you is dead.
And it's all your fault.
I need another one.
Beautiful women...
should never have
to buy their own drinks.
Thanks.
I'm Lance by the way.
You see, this is where
you supposed to say who you are.
Someone you don't
wanna know.
Why? Do you bite?
So mystery girl, are you...
here to forget a bad day or
are you looking to have
a good night?
Just trying to have a drink.
Alone.
In a place like this?
Let me get you another one.
Bartender?
Whatever she's having,
we'll have the bottle.
Lance?
Go away.
Look,
VIP room upstairs
guy ***
You and I will go out
and we chill, and uh...
You can use some warmed up,
you're ice cold honey.
I can get a lot colder.
You're a crazy bitch,
you know that?
Yeah, I know.
Blade The Series - 109 - Angels and Demons
You look like a little boy,
Waiting to open presents
on Christmas morning.
These are exciting times, Chase.
So the final ***
is confirmed?
Overwhelmingly.
All that's left is replication
the pathogen and of generalization
for delivery.
That,
and you enjoy the last look
on their faces.
I hate to ruin your day,
but you remember a few nights ago
when that woman stormed the lobby
then killed our disposal team?
One Lisa Starr.
Tell me you're joking.
Crazed, out of control,
like mother, like daughter.
Where is Krista?
We are about to achieve
something magnificient here.
Transform Chthon into
something new, something better.
Maybe it's time we thin our ranks,
clear out the underbrush.
Locate Krista and
collect her, safely.
Once the Pure Bloods are gone,
the last thing we need
is a problem like Krista.
Chase!
Find her!
This is where you guys work?
I gotta say, it looks
better over a computer.
Ever heard of a lamp,
maybe a couple of throw pillows?
- Did you bring 'em?
- Yeah.
The Aurora vaccine
I just needed in half,
and, a little bit less of the
stuff that came out of the girl.
Final results are right here.
So Marcus is making a...
Pure Blood poison?
It's biological masterpiece.
The Aurora vaccine
was just a start.
The emerging agent
is a DNA-based weapon
specifically engineered
to attack the Pure Blood genom.
It's one nasty bug.
Why use a pregnant woman?
A womb is the perfect
nutrient rich incubator.
It also ensures biological immunity
for anyone other than
the intended target.
So it's armless against us.
It only kills Pure Bloods.
So that sneaky bastard
wasn't even trying to create
a vampire immunity.
He was playing a palace coup.
Dude, crack a smile.
If Marcus takes out the
Pure Blood trash, we don't have to.
Maybe.
All he needs to do is get
the Pure Bloods together
in one place.
Sounds like a party.
You think Krista
got an invitation?
Find her, and I'll ask.
I'm trying.
Blurried all eyes in the street
but no one's seen her shadow.
Jus get it done.
No, really Blade.
You don't have to thank me.
Welcome to my nightmare.
Get off of me!
Please, I... said no!
***
Is that the only word
you bitches can say!
"No"?
Please!
I said no!
You... leave!
You... die!
Krista.
We've been looking
for you, darling.
It's time to go home.
Excuse-me sir.
What?
Armaya's reinstatement
has just become official.
The leaders of all the factions
are sending very generous gifts.
Send them back.
Sir?
Screw them all.
We're going to clean
this House.
Once I'm done with
the House of Chthon.
I thought that we were.
We haven't even started.
Call Van Sciver.
Tell him that we're stopping
by for a little visit.
Domic, with all your respect,
it's not wise.
It's necessary.
Charlotte and her lap dog Marcus
have been living the good lives
for years.
Forcing us to live of
of tables craps.
But Chthon has already
provided you with everything
you've demanded.
Then it's time to demand more.
- Let go of me.
- Look what I've found.
Where have you been?
In a filthy alley,
rummaging for a midnight snack.
I've been worried
about you Krista.
You know, well, worry is
your middle name, ain't it?
You've been drinking.
Obviously not enough.
You know, bitterness
isn't the most attractive emotion.
What am I supposed to feel Marcus, mmh?
Gratitude?
It would be a start.
No, the start was when
you killed my brother.
I told you before.
I didn't mean to kill Zack.
Don't you even say his name!
You need to accept
you brother's fate,
the same you need
to accept your own.
What, by living here?
With you animals?
We're your family.
My family is dead!
All I ever loved,
everything I ever was
is gone!
Replaced by a life
even better.
Life?
All you've given me is
one long night of nothing!
Then you simply haven't
opened your eyes.
Oh they are opened,
and every day they look at you
and see the bastard that killed me.
You think you're the only one.
You think you're the only vampire
who's ever felt pain?
Who's ever suffered loss?
Help me!!!
Get her to her room.
Clean her off.
Sir?
He just called.
- He?
- Domic, he'll be here tomorrow night.
Shen?
Haven't found Krista yet.
So what are you
doing about it?
I told you.
Put the word out.
What do you want me to do?
Tack up flyers around the neighborhood?
Lost vampire. Last scene :
ashing her own mother.
Maybe suicidal, homicidal or both.
Needs her meds.
We have to find out where Marcus
is going to poison the Pure Bloods.
And Krista will tell us,
just relax!
Give the girl some time.
It's weird, isn't it?
What?
That I haven't taken
your head off yet?
No, you and Marcus,
on the same side, gunning
for the Pure Bloods.
I guess the ennemy of
my ennemy is my friend.
Well, I don't have a problem
of killing my friends either.
Oh, bingo.
What?
One of those streets punks
that hangs out downtown.
He just saw Krista get scooped
outside a club before daybreak.
- Hot ride, hotter blonde.
- Chase.
At least our girl's
still alive.
So to speak.
Grab your shit.
We're going to Chthon.
What do you want?
I need to know that you're better.
Uh, you mean no longer a threat.
If I thought you really meant
the things you said and did
in my office
then Chase would be disposing
an ash stained carpet right about now.
Then why am I tied up?
Because you are a threat
to yourself.
Screw you!
Krista?
Krista?
Do you really think
you're alone?
Everyone I had is gone.
Everyone you thought you had.
The ones whose memories
are fading even now
no matter how hard you try
to hold on to them.
What are those people
to you really?
Acquaintances come and go,
friends... lose touch.
- You move on, they move on.
- But my family?
Accident of birth.
No more intentional than the color
of your eyes.
But you and I...
we're connected.
My life is in you.
Flows through you.
You know this.
A.D.E...
Every vampire shares an eternal
link with the one who turned them.
That's the gift of the
after death experience.
Who I am, who I was,
now lives in your blood.
Your mind,
is the only bone that
can't be broken by hate or hurt
or even time.
So if you want to kill me,
fine.
Just know that you can't kill
the part of me that will live
inside of you... forever.
Marcus, where are you
taking me?
Your eyes are closed?
Ok, nearly there.
- Are they still closed?
- Yes.
Ok.
- Ready?
- I'm ready.
- But you're really ready?
- Marcus!
Ok, open.
Oh, it's beautiful.
It's ***.
It's, it's apauling.
No, it's ours.
It's yours and mine.
We can start with dry goods,
and then fresh produce and flowers.
Let's start by removing
the rog*** first, shall we?
Didn't I tell you coming here
would change everything?
Your father can't stop us now.
We're oceans away,
and we can do whatever we choose.
So, we can buy a house?
As soon as you find one.
Start a family?
Maybe even sooner than that.
Whatever I am, Isabelle,
whatever kind of man I become,
it's all because of you.
No, it's all been
taken care of.
He's here.
See you when we land.
Hey Ray, are you ready?
You keep your word
and get me that meeting with Hendricks.
That was the director's office
on the horn
Said they'll have a car waiting
for us.
Let's go.
I'm proud at you, Ray.
Coming in is the
right thing to do.
Oh, what are you doing, buddy?
Thanking God that I didn't
give you my back up yesterday.
Come one Ray,
don't do anything crazy.
Come on!
I saw the mark.
I know!
So what, you're gonna start
running like there's some place
to hide from them?
You tell me, you work for them!
What you gonna do, shoot me, now?
Here in the street? Come on!
Shoot me.
Come on!
Shoot me, Ray.
Isabelle?
Yes.
She is beautiful.
In every way.
And you were?
Younger?
Human.
What I saw, you and Isabelle,
was that before you were turned?
You already know.
Marcus?
Marcus?
Take a break,
I'll bring you dinner.
Isabelle.
Don't have time.
We open in 2 days.
Oh, 5 minutes won't kill you.
Hum, I'm sorry gentlemen,
but we don't actually open until
the day after tomorrow.
Evening, friend.
That's some venture
you're undertaking.
Ambitious.
Thank you.
- Uh, mister?
- Domic.
And let me guess
you are not from Detroit.
London.
Disgusting city.
*** the smell of myself.
What can I do for you
Mr. Domic?
Actually, it's...
what I could do for you.
I'm not sure I follow.
You're surely noticed ours
is a growing city.
Each day more enterprises are commenced,
more people arrive.
Unfortunately not all newcomers
are honest in these industries such as yourself.
Rebels who don't know how to comport
themselves like gentlemen.
I understand, and you would like
to protect me from such rebel.
All that is due me is a small
sum paid weekly.
For that, my associates and
I will provide a bull work
against the unsafe tides raising
in our fair streets.
That's very generous,
Mr. Domic, but uh,
I believe I'll decline
your offer.
Offer?
I don't recall making one.
Marcus?
It's all right, dear.
It's just our neighbors ***.
We should be opening properly
in the next few days.
Yes.
We'll be back then,
to finalize our arrangement.
Untill then Madam,
just tell your husband
to secure the front doors.
Detroit is a lovely city but
it has his ugly elements.
I heard his demands.
Then you heard my refusal.
- Marcus, I don't think a man like...
- Isabelle!
He's gone.
It's all right.
Now,
how about that dinner
that smells so good.
You're shitting me?
You wanna break into Chthon?
Girl's on a knife's edge.
If she falls off,
I wanna her falling our way.
So you can catch her right?
Right?
That's our way in.
The sewer?
Lovely.
It's how Krista
got to their labs.
And got caught.
We'll do it quieter.
I'll grab my tools.
And I'll grab mine.
How is sleeping beauty?
She's still sleeping.
You've been terribly
indulgent with her.
We all make allowances with
those who share birth experience.
You and Frederick for example.
I'd like to kill him.
And yet, you never have.
I hear Domic's on his way.
In a few hours.
What are you going to do?
Remind him who he's dealing with.
So shop keep, our arrangement?
I told you, there'll be none.
It would be wise to reconsider.
You'd be wise
to leave my store.
Better do as he says, fellows.
Man's armed with the push ***.
You'll get nothing from me Domic,
nothing!
We'll see, shop keep.
We'll see.
And I thought vampires were
the most disgusting things
in this place.
Well, Krista said the pipe
leading to the med lab is
around this corner.
Van Sciver bricked it up.
So this enjoyable little *** has gotten squat..
- We can get through this.
- No, no, no, wait!
Shock sensors.
Any unordinary vibration
and the cavalery comes running.
Well, we have to find the way
to know what's going on with Krista.
Think we just did.
Still no word from Gonesse?
Then we must assume they never will be.
At least, it confirms
our suspicions.
Marcus and his newest recruit
cannot be trusted.
Which means we will
accelerate our plans.
Bring me the girl.
*** the *** of
the security camera.
Oh, if I don't fry
myself first.
Got it.
Now, this trunk supports
the IT system PBX,
phones, data and alpha can just
isolate the security feed.
And, pop an uplink,
who can tune in to BSTV.
BSTV?
Blood Sucker Television,
24-hour Chthon network,
all vamps, all the time!
Tough room.
You think it's vampire
or familiars?
Either way, they die.
Keep working.
Control?
Have a possible breach
in tunnel 12,
checking it out now.
You?
What you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Getting a manucure?
Someone called city about an IT
line that got chewed through.
This is motorisation.
Toolbox, right there.
You got some real
problems, pal.
Real scary shit.
What?
Like rats?
No.
Daywalkers.
Done.
So was he.
Sleep my angel.
Marcus!
You had your chance to pay.
No!
Now she will!
No, Isabelle!
No!
What kind of a monster
are you?
A monster?
I am something far greater.
Something you'll come
to understand.
I'd be rather choose death.
Death just chose you,
shop keep.
Isabelle?
Marcus?
Where are you taking me?
Blade.
I'm online.
So where is she?
There!
Something's wrong with her.
Yeah, she looks drunk.
No, something else.
Wait!
Help. Help me.
Agent Collins?
I'm sorry,
I had nowhere else to go.
- Come in, please.
- Thanks.
Was Sorensen alive?
I don't know. I think so.
- But you don't know...
- He was trying to kill me,
I didn't check his pulse.
I just have to stay alive
long enough to
expose these things for what
they are and the people who helped them.
Bastards like Sorensen.
You must think
I'm out of my mind.
Then we both are.
If you'd shown up at my door step
in the middle of the night
a month ago talking
about vampires.
Governments in collusion.
I probably would have called the cops.
What changed?
Everything.
What's this?
Proof
that you're not crazy
and neither am I.
Believe me, I started
to feel pretty nuts
trying to figure out
what happened that night
at the truck store.
The butcher truck?
Yeah, fire, the body pallets.
It all just got too weird.
So I called in a favor at central.
A friend of mine gave me
all the files of every case
over the last 10 years
with even the slightest similarity.
And?
And I found stuff.
Strange deaths.
Corpses with bite wounds.
Evidence of...
events describing
spontaneous combustion.
So what are the people
to be ***?
Whoever does is trying
to burry him.
Right after I xeroxed all these
and got the originals
back to my friend at central.
He disappeared.
His job, his appartment,
every trace of him is gone.
They got him.
Somebody did.
So there's no one
who can help us?
There might be one.
He uh,
he goes with
the name of Blade.
The guy is in profiling peg him
as psychopath with psyzophrenic deviations.
Blade on the other hand
reffers to himself as a hunter.
Who is he hunting?
Not who, what.
Is he custody?
He escaped.
Last seen in Detroit.
Van Sciver.
Domic.
I'm surprised you allowed me in.
Is that why you brought help?
Puzic, wait downstairs.
- Sir, I don't...
- Wait downstairs.
So, this is where it
all happens uh?
The heights from which the mighty
Marcus Van Sciver makes
the world do his bidding.
It's good furniture, Domic.
Please, suppress the urge
to urinate on it.
I just thought for the self proclaimed
leaders of the vampire nation,
the House of Chthon would be
a little more... upscale.
Get to the point.
Do I need one?
Can't I just visit?
We are partners now right?
Under protest.
Oh yeah, that's right,
you didn't want Charlotte
cutting me in on your little
experiments, did you?
Even after I found out it was
my people you were cutting up
to make it happen.
The House of Armaya will receive
priority access when
the Aurora vaccine is ready.
The negociations for this
arrangement have been concluded.
So there really is nothing left
for us to discuss.
That's just it.
I'm here to reopen
negociations.
I want a piece of
your action too.
Precisely what action
would that be?
All of it.
Real estate developments,
currency speculation.
My House has been living out
of *** for centuries.
So I want a slice of every pie
you got your fingers in.
I'm afraid,
you've made your trip in vain.
You'll receive nothing
more from me.
Or my House.
Do I have to remind you of
your place in the world, Van Sciver?
I am a Pure Blood.
I can take whatever I want from you
and there's not a goddamn thing
you could say about it.
You know what Domic,
there was a time when
it was indeed true.
You did take everything I had.
What are you talking about?
A hundred years ago.
My wife Isabelle.
I swallowed my grief.
Biding my time.
A century's worth.
And now it's here.
The moment where I...
take from you.
Screw you!
And screw Isabelle!
Marcus?
Do you know how many men
I killed over the years?
How many women I've taken?
Why are you laughing?
You, all this time,
burning with revenge for me.
I don't even remember you
of whoever you say that whore
was you say I killed.
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
I do!
Marcus?
I'm fine!
I'll alert medical.
I said I'm fine Chase!
Domic's man. He's downstairs.
On my way.
Marcus, I saw what
happen to Isabelle.
To you.
It's only what happens
to all our kind.
Like you and your mother.
It hurts so much,
being alone.
Then you don't have
to be Krista...
ever.
Where is Domic?
Hell.
Care to join him?
Wait, wait, here she is.
- Who is she with? Is that...
- Yeah.
So where are they going?
It just got worse.
They're onto us, They're trying
to find our taps.
Not yet.
Damn it!
Hey?
Where are you going?

Previously on Blade
Marcus and his newest
recruit cannot be trusted.
Bring me the girl.
- You wanna break into Chthon?
- Girl's on a knife's edge.
If she falls off,
I want her falling our way.
- We're your family.
- My family is dead!
... you're the only vampire
who's ever felt pain?
Who's ever suffered loss?
- What I saw... you were?
- Younger?
Human.
I'm here to
reopen negociations.
I want a piece of
your action too.
- Something's wrong with her.
- Yeah, she looks drunk.
No, something else.
It hurts so much, being alone.
Then you don't
have to be Krista.
Two beers.
Good crowd tonight?
Not if you're working
on tips.
You gotta take a day off.
You've ever been
to Detroit zoo?
We should go sometime.
They have lions.
Alright.
We're already in a zoo.
Can I get a vodka and tonic?
- Lime?
- Yeah.
4 bucks.
Hey?
What are you doing
off the floor?
You're tired already?
Thirsty.
Zed?
Watch and learn.
Just don't forget to pay
your tab this time.
Come on, sexy!
- It's Jennifer.
- Yeah.
You want to get out
of here?
Like leave?
Yeah.
This place is dead anyway.
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
Who is there?
Who is that?
Let me go!
Leave me alone!
All you want!
Blade The Series - 110 - Hunters
***
I don't know. You know?
What am I gonna do?
I can't ***.
I didn't talk to her. You know.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Come on, give me a break!
You know what?
Come on!
You're hunting?
Me too.
What... what are you doing?
Cleaning you up.
From what?
You got too close to Marcus.
What are you talking about?
House of Chthon keeps
their windows open at night.
I took a peak.
Screw you!
Hmm, screw me.
Come on Blade, look,
I had to protect my cover.
You're off the serum.
You drank blood.
Look, Blade...
I'm done.
I'm fine.
Fine huh?
Damn!
If the detox doesn't work.
Our partnership is done.
And you're ash.
What?
That asshole forgot
to pay his tab again.
It's Zed, he will be back.
Yeah, but he never
tips when he forgets.
Have some of mine.
I had a good night.
That's sweet but... it's ok.
Maybe this snake's
still here.
Zed?
Zed?
Zed?
Since when does a missing person
involve vampires?
They're the reason people
go missing around here.
You know that.
She's probably already dead,
or worse.
You didn't give up
when it was your sister.
That was different.
Before the Daywalker...
you did it anyway.
At least talk to the girl...
or you can forget
the free popcorn.
I don't have time for this.
I told you to wait.
I know, I'm sorry.
My name is Bethany.
He  said that
you could help me.
Will you?
I haven't spoken to her
in 4 days.
- You said your sister's
name was Nicki?
- Yeah.
Let me guess.
She's the wild sister?
Not  really, no.
Those are from work.
She's a waitress at a club.
It's some underground
place.
She's only been there
for a few weeks.
She was trying to get me
to move downtown with her.
She said that
she missed me.
I didn't know
she ever missed me.
But the police aren't
doing anything.
I don't have anyone else
to go to.
I'll look into it. Ok?
Thank you.
How did you get so big?
Don't bother, Chase.
He only likes to play
with human girls.
He has quite a collection.
I'm sure.
Relax, my dear.
If I wanted you dead,
Thorne would have already
twisted your head off.
You do know
why you're here.
I'm sure I don't,
Charlotte.
I've watched you
for decades Chase.
Most of the turned lacked
the proper perspective.
Their emotional turmoils from
their human lives carry over
into the next like phantom pains.
It's a weakness.
One the Pure Bloods
thankfully don't share.
Your anger from your human life
stains this one, Chase.
But somehow you've managed
to use it as fuel.
I know at your core
it's because
you are a survivor.
- I had to be.
- Yes.
Ambitious.
Thirsty for control.
Willing to tear apart
anything that threathens you.
Anything.
And I admire that.
The truth is...
You remind me of me
when I was your age.
And perhaps in 200 years,
you'll understand why
I do the things I do.
Have you ever smelled
something so sweet?
Fresh blood taken from
a newborn only hours old.
Free from the sourness of life.
Drink.
Marcus Van Sciver is
different than you and I Chase.
He suffers from
delusions of grandeur.
He doesn't understand that
the survival of our world
depends on a hierarchy.
I believe he's been
planning something sinister
against us for quite some time.
I  don't know.
Oh, but you do.
I've brought you here to ask you
one simple question Chase.
Are you loyalties of Marcus...
or Chthon?
So what do we do
if she gets out?
If Krista breaks out
before I let her out,
you treat her like
any other blood suckers.
Dude!
Van Sciver is ready
to make his move against
the Chthon Pure Bloods.
I wanna make sure he succeeds.
If Krista doesn't return to them,
there can be delays.
She could expose
herself and us.
Then everything we work towards
goes up in flame.
Man, she's had a rough few weeks.
Ease up a little.
I let her out,
she's going straight
for your throat.
She's not your friend right now.
She gets free, people will die!
And part of our job
is to keep people from dying.
- Right?
- What do you got?
So what do you think?
I don't see a face.
I didn't either but,
that's not what got my attention.
Check this out.
A glyph.
I'm guessing, but it doesn't
belong to any of the Twelve Houses.
- No.
- And it makes no sense.
Unfortunately it does.
There are a lot of
unaffiliated vampires.
Building their own little kingdoms.
They don't want
to belong to the Houses?
Houses don't want them.
Too uncontrolable.
Like the White Prince.
That's who this glyph
belongs to?
- Now, who is he?
- Whistler mentionned
him once or twice.
I know the glyph
and the name, but...
that's about it.
See what you can dig up.
In the meantime,
I gonna find his familiar.
How are you gonna do that?
Shake the right tree.
This is *** god!
You own this place?
Dude, I own ten places.
If you get marked, you get it.
You want girls?
You want a fistful of cash?
You want *** for a while?
Get it all.
You sure you can get me in?
Dude, I'm the king
of familiars in this town.
Your dad being a judge
and all that?
You got a use.
You got a future.
How many years you gotta put in?
How much time for you're turned?
See, that's the beautiful
thing right there, Andy.
Once you get bit
by the bosses,
time don't matter no more.
Join up. Get marked.
Get it all.
Yeah!
Oh shit.
Oh yeah!
Hey, hey, we're cool, you are
not going to kill me, are you?
Come back here, I will.
Now you better get to a doctor.
You're bleeding.
Help me! Somebody help me!
Go get some ice cream.
This my club, it's under the
protection of Chthon.
King of familiars, uh?
Well, I got a question for you.
I'm looking for
another familiar.
Branded with this.
Know him?
Yeah, yeah,
there was a guy.
He was with the House of Erebus
until he found a better gig.
He became a personal
to some solo vamp.
He bragged about how he was on
the fast track to immortality.
What his asshole's name?
Man  I can't remember,
so many of these guys come and go!
Where do I find him?
Metal club called Trash.
Wannabee spends all
his time there.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ!
Krista?
Let me out.
-  I can't.
- No!
It hurts.
I know.
No, you don't.
Blade knows.
Blade doesn't know anything!
Krista, I know
you can do this.
You went to the Lychan
blood ritual and you came back.
I know you can handle this.
You can beat the thirst.
Krista?
Help!
Somebody help me, please!!!
What are you doing?
What are you doing to me?
No!
Please don't!
How has she been?
Quiet.
Really?
You think what
she's doing is easy?
I know it's not.
Have you found that familiar?
Getting there.
Hangs at the same club
the missing girl worked at.
Learned anything more
about this White Prince?
More than I want to.
Looks like our perp
is a nomad.
And he works on the
metonic lunar cycle.
Pops up once
every 19 years.
Have you ever heard of
Gilles de Rais?
Should I?
He was a 15th century nobleman
in France who had a taste for
canibalism, sadism,
and was probably a cat lover.
His servants used to lure
children back to his home
where he tortured
and mutilated them.
When they caught him, he was
found dancing in one of his
victims entrails.
Became known as
the White Prince.
And there have been other killers
like him throughout history.
Places where this glyph
would show up.
Garrett the Butcher,
16th century Germany.
And the Red Rover Man in Seattle,
early 1900s.
And you think
this is the same guy?
Changing his M.O.
along the way.
Not entirely.
It says that he disfigured
his face by his own hands,
So he somehow managed
to permanently scar himself
with silver.
That's why he's gotta get
familiars to lure his victims in.
I found out where the
new familiar likes to fish.
So let's go find him and ask him
where the Prince
is building his castle?
No.
We have to do it quietly.
Why?
One wrong move from us
and this guy is a shadow!
Could disappear for
another 19 years.
Then how do we get this familiar
to show us the way?
Give him what
his master wants.
A girl.
Who?
The sister.
You don't have
to do this, Bethany.
Who else is going to?
We could find someone.
And how long will that take?
You should know your sister
might not be alive.
Yeah.
You can only hope.
Do you know who took
my sister, Shen?
Not really but, we know that
he'll be going for another girl.
So I'll be that girl.
Alright.
What's that?
This has a transponder in it.
- I can track you anywhere you are.
- Ok.
- I just need to attach you.
- Ok.
Here.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's ok. Just...
You can clip it on.
We won't let anything
happen to you, Bethany.
We?
Wow.
Don't freak.
Freak?
No, I...
Are you kidding?
I mean, he...
looks like he could
take anything on. And,
that's good, right?
Open your eyes.
Open them.
Do you know what I am?
I know what you are.
You're a child of God.
You're corrupted
by your sins.
I was too.
But I died.
And rose again.
Royalty reborn
as a seraphim.
A by-product of
humans and angels.
I will forever
walk on earth
drowning in your blood
to behold the glory.
Your insides hold the doorway
to the bite.
If only for the briefest
of moment.
You don't believe I'm what
I say I am, do you?
You're like the others,
you need to see.
I am chosen.
I am holy.
Do you have her in sight, Shen?
I see her.
She's cute.
What?
- That chick, she's cute.
- Yeah.
Can I get you a drink?
Coke.
And?
Just a coke.
Sure.
Blade?
I don't like this.
You don't think I'd rather be
in there cracking skulls open?
I  show my face, the White Prince disappear.
Look,
there's only one way
get in and out this place.
And I'm watching it.
Still,
using a desperate girl
as a piece of cheese.
It's the only move, Shen.
What about her sister?
You don't think
she's still alive, do you?
No.
Do you even hope she is?
Do you care?
You do that for me.
You're new here?
You're looking for someone?
Cause if not,
I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Shit!
- What?
Actually, I...
I am here with someone.
Must be a real lucky guy.
Why don't you tell me
how I can get that lucky.
Please, stop,
stop, stop, please!
Blade?
He's making a move for her.
Stick to the plan!
New plan! Hey!
Where is she, you prick?
Who?
Shen?
You know who.
Her sister.
The girl you picked up
the other night.
You alright?
Come on!
Show me the glyph.
What?
I don't know what
you're talking about!
I'm sorry, alright man.
I didn't know she was with you.
Bethany?
Bethany?
Blade?
- She didn't come out.
- But, she had to. She's not in.
Shit!
The virus will be ready
for transport in 3 days, sir.
Thank you.
Marcus.
Chase.
I've been looking for Krista.
Have you seen her?
No.
Where have you been?
At a tea party.
I know you can handle this.
You can beat the thirst.
I don't feel very well.
Our partnership is done.
And you're ash.
And you're ash.
We're doing a good thing.
We could't have done
it without you.
You can beat the thirst.
Hmm, Krista.
Don't forget to drink.
You shouldn't have gone
to Charlotte's.
I didn't have a choice.
What else did you tell her?
Our little girl
did most of the talking.
But did you tell her anything?
Nothing she didn't
already know.
She wants a pair of eyes
and ears inside your operations.
Mine.
And your answer?
I told Goldy Locks
I needed to think about it.
Go back to her.
Tell her you made up
your mind.
And you'd like to prove it.
I know!
I didn't say anything.
I made a mistake.
I'm gonna get cleaned up.
Holy shit!
Shen?
What?
The transponder is moving.
She's still in there.
Just looked! I didn't see her.
There's gotta be
another way out.
Is there a basement?
I don't know.
Yeah, I bet there is.
You bet there is what?
Where did you take her?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Yes,
you goddamn
well know who.
You're that sick bastard's
delivery boy.
Shen?
Blade. I got him.
Shen?
Son of a bitch.
He's leading me to the glory,
to divinity.
Where is she?
He's been transformed.
And one day I will be...
into perfection.
Go, go ***. Come on!
You're his familiar,
aren't you?
We heard you talk to him.
Say his name... Blade!
Tell me.
After all the work you do
for him.
What's he gonna do for you.?
Fuck you.
Please, don't!
I'm sorry.
If I'd known you worked
for Blade, I...
Shen, find the girl.
What a pretty smile.
And I'm gonna rip yours off.
You're gonna be alright.
You're gonna be alright.
He said he wanted
a hundred people.
One hundred people and
I'd get to live forever.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, we are.
Now living forever?
I got you!
It's just not you!
You're a hunter.
Like me.
I'm nothing like you.
But you are.
You enjoy it.
Enjoy what?
Killing, pain, torture.
You think you're special?
Some kind of god?
I am a seraphim!
A prince appointed by a power
much higher than us.
You're nothing but an another
crazy ass vampire.
Blasphemy!
You were sent by the devil
to challenge my faith.
To close the doorway
to the heavens.
You talk too much.
What's the matter, asshole?
Not smiling anymore?
You know, I think
I see the light.
I got you, ok?
Everything is gonna be
alright now.
I still don't understand
everything that happened.
Take care of yourself.
Thorne, we're going home.
Call the jet. I wanna be
in the air within the hour.
The board will be
very interested to hear this.
I'm sure they will.
You've done well, Chase.
It's only the beginning
of what I can do for you.
A present. How nice.
The Daywalker's?
A promise.
Marcus now, Blade next.
Our relationship
is paying off already.
Shit!
What do want me to say?
That you were right?
You don't have
to say anything.
I lost everyone, mmh...
everything.
Addicts never handle
loss very well.
And that's what you are.
An addict.
But you have a choice.
Keep going or not.
Does it ever getting better?
Every time I kill a vampire.
Marcus is making his move against
the Chthon Pure Bloods soon.
I need to know where
it's gonna be.
He's not gonna tell me.
Get him to trust you.
And he will.
Yeah.
Do you trust her?
Next time on Blade.
Do you know a Pure Blood
named Charlotte?
One of Chthon's heavy hitters.
Marcus snuck a bomb into her jet,
blew out of the sky about an hour ago.
This ain't nothing you wanna
get involved in.
- Just get the hell out of here.
- I'm staying.
We gotta find that plane.
What do you need, Chase?

Did you have fun?
Fun?
Where have you been for
last 36 hours?
I didn't know you were counting.
Your absence is always apparent.
Really?
When you're gone, I hardly
even notice.
All I'm saying Krista
is that you were missed.
So you and I spend a night together
and now I'm on your leash.
Of course not.
I was just concerned.
Don't be.
About Charlotte.
What about her?
She intercepted Chase.
Tried to corrupt her.
And?
Chase loyalties are with us,
as they will always be.
Why would Charlotte
make a play now?
Do you think she knows?
About my plans against them?
It doesn't matter.
Since when?
Since right about...
this very moment.
Do you think this will
be our world forever?
Or we will one day walk in
daylight like Marcus promises?
For once, I'm at a loss to know.
So many changes occurring.
This Marcus business.
The Conclave approaching.
Yes, and Gonnesse.
Still part of me has hope.
Odd isn't it?
Perhaps, it's knowing that
Chase is now on our side.
Or perhaps it's the prize
she's promised us.
Didn't I say it'd be
awesome up here.
You didn't say it'd this cold.
Small price to pay.
Hearing all this.
I don't hear anything.
Exactly, no cars,
no cell phones,
no corporate sheep babbling
their corporate bullshit.
Just you and me...
Holy shit!!!
Call 911!
We don't have cell phone!
Maybe someone made it.
Come on!
Blade The Series - 111 - Monsters
Any luck?
Another dead end.
With a dead vampire
I'm guessing.
Only thing I made ***.
You get that list done yet?
It'd be easier finding places
Marcus didn't own property.
Dude got buildings worldwide.
I mean I find 90 so far 22
in North America alone.
We only need to find one.
Where he's gonna mask
to Chthon Pure Bloods.
So you can go watch?
So I can join the party.
We're gonna getting close uh?
The big brass ring.
We'll be getting a big brass dick
if we don't find out where
it’s going down.
Any word on Krista?
Not a peep since
she went back to Chthon.
You think she’s getting
hell for being AWOL too long?
All Chthon all you get is hell.
What's that?
Company.
Probably just a homeless guy
looking for a place to crash.
That's a gun, not a pillow.
Let's go wish him good night.
You, get up!
Ok.
Easy, put your hands
above you head.
Turn around slowly.
Were you Eric Brook...
Wait a minute,
you're not Blade!
And you're not that smart!
Oh...
my god!
Who was that?
Scott, no one...
would survive this.
I  don't think I wanna
be here anymore.
- Elise stay put, I'll be right back.
- No!
Jesus!
Honey, are you, are you...
are you ok?
I will be in a moment.
Scott?
Scott?
Enjoy your nap?
He won't wake up
for the next one.
Hey, easy guys, I'm uh,
I'm just someone looking
for a few answers.
Just someone?
Alright I'm a Fed.
Ok, that hurt.
I hate Feds.
Yeah he does. They anger him.
Now start talking.
Kind of a long story.
You ain't going nowhere.
So  Charlotte is dead?
As Cesar. And only
a hundred years too late.
- And a Pure Blood believe you.
- Unanimously.
I've been filling cause all day.
It's a horrible loss.
A painful day for the vampire nation.
And just what I told them it was.
A tragic accident.
Though, I may have planted
the tinyest seed.
Could have been an act of retaliation
from the House of Armaya.
Marcus?
Be careful.
- If the board suspects
even the slightest thing.
- Please.
Compared to convincing Charlotte I
was a loyal servant all these years,
making those idiots think
that I'm consumed with grief
will be walking in a park.
So the Conclave is proceeding.
They're insisting upon it.
Said the delivery of Aurora
would have been Charlotte's wish.
A tribute to her enduring
legacy in the House of Chthon.
My  only regret?
It's that I didn't get to watch
the little bitch die in the same
excruciating manner they all will.
So Toronto?
What job do I get?
The best one.
Unleashing it.
Probably more condoleances now.
Van Sciver.
No.
No, don't put him on the phone.
I wanna to hear his explanation
in person in my office
first thing tomorrow.
Problem?
Renovation on the Conclave site
is falling behind.
Bringing the architect here
for a little come to Jesus!
Should I join the party?
You know how much I enjoy
helping people meet our Lord.
No you stay here.
Keep us on schedule.
Krista'll help me.
Marcus, not her!
You have your job Chase,
so do it.
Your people at the FBI
know you find me?
Actually.
I haven't uh,
kept them up to speed
in my investigation.
- I don't think they'd understand.
- Good.
Now do everybody a favor,
and leave.
Leave?
This ain't nothing
you wanna get involved in.
You got a ring on your finger.
Go back to your family
wherever they are.
- Just get the hell out of here.
- I'm staying.
Not if you plan
on living.
Hey listen to me!
I'm not some asshole off
the street. I'm a Federal agent!
We can work together.
Take down Van Sciver.
- Nobody is bringing him down.
- He's a goddamn killer.
I'm not saying he doesn't
deserve it.
But right now his goals
are my goals.
Enemy of my enemy
and all that...
Fine, so when you're done with that,
then we take him down.
We?
There's no we.
There's me and there's vampires.
I kill 'em and they die.
Only way it works.
You want me stopped?
Stop me.
Not a problem.
Another incoming.
Payphone...
22nd & Adams.
Gotta be her.
And?
I'll kill him in a second.
Just answer it.
- Krista?
- Yeah, it's me.
Tell me you've found
out where the Conclave is at.
Sorry, but Marcus has already
started the blood bath.
Do you know a Pure Blood
named Charlotte?
- One of Chthon's heavy hitters.
- Well not anymore.
Marcus snuck a bomb into her jet,
blew out of the sky about an hour ago.
Hey, one hunter down, five to go.
Where was Charlotte's plane
when he took her down?
Somewhere over
north of Michigan.
Hey, listen, I gotta get back.
Just thought you guys should know.
We gotta find that plane.
Blade those vamps ashed
long before they hit the ground.
I'm not looking for them.
Just what they had.
Pure Bloods live like ghosts.
Secret lives, always on the move.
Which means all the information
travels with them.
Maybe even edges to the Conclave.
If it didn't burn up.
We find the wreckage
and we find out.
- So get on it.
- Ok,
but finding a down plane
in the middle of nowhere
could take a couple of hours,
maybe a couple of days.
I'm not exactly the FAA.
You don't need the FAA,
just the FBI.
Bureau has access
to Napster 3.0 for flights.
Domestic surveillance imaging.
So do it.
We need the information.
We?
- I... I thought there was no we.
- Let me guess,
unless you're involved.
Where you go I go.
Forget it.
And good luck finding
that plane!
Hey Collins, he barely lets me
going anywhere with him
and this time I'm going.
Dude.
He's staying here.
Track the Conclave for ***.
- You said we've find it out there.
- I said maybe.
It could turn out just to be
another dead end.
Great!
So it's back printouts
and push pens and hey!
Even before I do that,
I gotta pull a missing jet
out of my ass!
Wasting time
doing that too.
Answer might just be
a few clicks away.
Okay, Collins.
Find the goddamn plane.
Alright.
Sir?
You wanted to see me?
Don't I always?
Yeah.
Sometimes so much
you come to my room unasked.
Not to be confused with
those times you invite me in.
Let me say again.
I invaded your privacy
and I apologize.
Accepted.
Now,
about me invading your privacy.
Well that was simply
something that happened.
Exactly.
Not to say it was meaningless.
- I didn't...
- Good, because I would hate
to exclude you
from the number of things
recently that have given me
great pleasure.
- Like?
- Like,
you coming to a better
understanding of who I am.
And me getting to collect
on a debt long owned me by Domic.
Hallucinations and murder.
I'm almost touched the game
with me ranks so highly.
You know what I mean.
So what's on the menu
for today?
Well, despite Charlotte's
tragic demise,
the leaders of our House have
agreed that Aurora should be
delivered as planned.
Right now they're preparing
to join into the Conclave from
points around the world.
Unfortunately though,
the building's restauration
is falling behind schedule.
I have summoned my architect.
I was hoping that you and I could
impress upon him the importance
of meeting our deadline.
I'm sure we can.
And it shouldn't take long
for me to get up to speed either.
That...
would be a terrible mistake.
You don't trust me?
I think
that you and I can spend
the next half-an-hour
more productively.
You didn't answer my question.
I only trust those I know.
So this would be you getting
to know me better?
Like I said,
you've  got under my skin.
And allow me the same pleasure.
Holy shit!
Come on!
So what exactly
are we looking for?
Paper work, laptops,
any kind of information.
Hey Blade?
Did you find any bodies?
I'm not expecting to.
Charlotte's people
would have all been vampires.
Vampires ash.
We have a pretty good
hole here.
Take it back and
comb through it.
Not just yet.
What is it?
Blood.
Jesus!
- What are you, a vampire?
- Half.
Still happy you came along?
Ok...
Collins, over here!
Jesus! I guess there was
a human aboard.
Look at their necks.
There were fed on.
Somebody in that plane survived.
How is that possible?
Doesn't  matter.
Only thing that matters
is finding 'em
and killing 'em.
Faster, it will be light soon.
Put me down.
Finally, refuge.
Another meal as well.
So what uh,
what language is this?
Serdic, vampire mother tongue.
- You can read it?
- Shen can.
The other guy who
is working for you.
Not working,
an arrangement.
He's been looking for
a couple of vampires for years.
And then you kill them?
Just find them.
Shen gets the honors.
What about the girl
who called? Krista?
What about we see how long
you can walk without asking
me a question?
Sorry.
Investigating is the job.
Was.
You got fired from the FBI.
On the computer.
You tipped in
the name Jessica Ellis.
So,
- unless you had
some kind of an operation.
- No.
No. I got fired.
I found out my bosses were working
for Van Sciver as well as the Bureau.
He had some kind of a...
- a tatoo on his wrist like a...
- Glyph.
Your bosses are familiars.
That's what you call 'em,
familiars?
I call 'em targets.
Blade you and I are more
like than you think.
We both kill monsters.
What do you know
about monsters?
More than I'd like,
year and a half ago.
I arrested to a spree killer,
he just liked murdering people.
Tracked  him down, made a case,
locked him up.
His lawyer found a problem
with the warrant.
Got him sprung.
While he was awaiting his trial,
he took the opportunity to uh,
break into my house.
He murdered my wife and child.
Sara and Johanna.
I made sure he didn't make it
to the second trial.
Franck?
You are on pancakes.
Ok, when those doors open,
I want big smiles,
people, big smiles.
Knock it off before
I start cracking heads.
I'm going to the back
to get more of *** sugar.
Let's go come on!
It's good.
Good Lord!
Are you alright?
Sir, can I help you?
Sir, can you hear me?
Nice place.
Look quiet though.
Like a crypt.
Where do you want to start?
Where they did.
Jesus!
I've seen some things but...
Closer you'll get to Charlotte,
the worse you're gonna see.
You think she's still here?
It's light out.
Nowhere else for her to go.
- Now let's get busy!
- Hey wait no!
They'll rise again.
- Exactly why she turned them.
- They're people!
Not anymore!
That's why we send 'em
to their graves now.
Hey, maybe someone
is still alive, come on!
No, Collins!
Dumbass!
Ok I got this!
Collins.
Ready?
It's a trap.
It's a school.
It could be a kid.
You gotta be kidding me!
Come on.
This is outrageous.
Marcus is pissed
because we're behind, so he
makes me drop everything
and come all the way here
just to keep me waiting!
Is there a problem Tucker?
Yes there is, your boss.
Who is he in with, Sabine?
Sorry for the delay,
please come in.
- I already told you that...
- No one
shuts me out.
How bad is it?
Bad.
Femoral artery.
Alright, I'm not leaving.
You will when I'll put your ass
out into the street.
Blade, half the town is
in here, ready to rise.
You told me yourself.
Do you ever leave
when someone tells you to?
Look,
you just go find Charlotte and
I'll take care of the rest of 'em.
How?
By being the bait.
I understand why you want
to retina scanners on the entrance.
I just don't get why the entire
ventilation system needs refitting.
Because I requested it.
But the one in there is fine!
The compressors are 78/50,
the ACH for the *** fine.
Which is way more than enough.
My guests are irreclusive.
I know who your guests are.
I'm busting my ass for accomodating
their long lists of security needs.
As well as yours.
The location for the Conclave site
is very highly guarded secret.
I get that!
You just need to understand
this is a very old building.
Beautiful but old.
Which means the preparation...
Mr. Marfit,
this is not a negociation.
- Who is she?
- My associate.
Well, tell your associate
I do not respond to threats.
What do you respond to, Tucker?
Excuse me?
Is it more money?
Because I'm suddendly getting
the distinct impression I'm being widdeled.
You know what Marcus?
You don't like
I'm doing this job?
Do it yourself.
You said what?
You've heard me.
I'm hoping I didn't.
Or what?
You'll fire me, kill me?
This close to your big party.
And even if you did,
you'll never find someone
half as good as me.
There are buildings all over
the world that attest of the fact
that we are a hell of a team.
But you must remember that you're not
the only one under a hell of
lot of pressure on this job!
And even though,
I may be just a familiar
but I believe
I've earned the right
to not be treated like
a goddamn shoe-shine boy.
You know, Tucker, you're right.
I'm not going to fire you.
And I'm certainly not gonna waste
your considerable talent
by killing you.
In fact, I'll make you a promise.
Money is as no object,
while this project is concerned.
We'll supply you with
every additional ressource.
Tools, man power,
anything you require.
Thank you.
And if even then,
though you get everything
you've asked for,
the location is not completely
ready for the Conclave,
I promise I will render every one
you ever loved...
just like this!
You may not be replacible,
but every one around you...
is.
Sabine!
See, you already
have a new assistant.
Don't worry, Mr. Marfit,
I'll be right behind you
every step away.
Now Tucker,
do us all a favor.
Go back and finish your job.
Thank you.
Dispose of that.
Krista!
I'll do it,
as I always have.
Yes Chase,
as you always have.
You're sure about this?
It's better than leaving huh?
And if it doesn't work.
Then you do me a favor.
- And you make sure...
- Trust me, you won't.
No, I'm safe where I am
for the moment.
Send no one until dusk.
Make no other moves.
I want Marcus to enjoy
his little illusion of victory.
Till it's time for him
not to enjoy it.
I'll sleep untill dark.
Then we're gone.
Ok.
Come on, you bastards!
That's right.
Fresh human blood.
Everybody gets a taste,
come on!
God, I hope this works.
What was that?
Time is up, Pure Blood.
Charlotte?
Hey, Lurch.
Freeze.
Please don't hurt me.
Those things out there.
We were helping out with pancakes.
They got my daddy.
I ran in here to hide.
No.
No, you're the...
the Pure Blood.
I just wanna find my daddy.
And make everything ok.
Alright, honey.
I'll help you find your daddy.
I wanna hear you scream.
Scream!!!
Can you hear me now???
Collins.
Blade?
Blade!
So good to finally meet you.
Wish I could say the same.
Come now.
No respect for
long time fellow?
Not even a little.
Well, I have respect for you.
That's why hope you'll entertain
my offer.
You're in a position
to offer anything?
I'll admit,
recent events haven't quite gone
as I would have liked.
But now it's clear.
You and I share
a common ennemy.
Marcus.
I might even be able to broker
you a deal between you and
the Twelve Houses.
Allow me to get to the Conclave
and I'll secure you a place
in the family.
You're half of what we are Blade.
I wouldn't even claim that much
keenship with a traitor like Marcus.
Think about it.
A chance to have a home.
To lay down your arms.
We could put your skills
to their best use.
Help your many talents
flower like never before.
You know Charlotte,
that does sound pretty good.
But this is my only talent.
Nice.
Collins,
don't worry.
I'm getting you out of here.
No, it's too late.
But,
thanks for letting me do it.
Do what?
Kill a few monsters.
Now it's your turn.
Collins, listen you don't...
No,
no, you promised.
Oh Marcus, no.
Yes.
It was hers.
Long ago, too long.
Doesn't anyone knock
in this place?
I knocked, you didn't answer.
I was in the shower.
For a very long time.
What do you want Chase?
Only to let you know
that I understand.
Understand?
What he sees in you.
Your beauty.
Your youth.
Even a man trully dead
cannot help but notice.
I only wish
he could see what I see.
Which is?
Nothing.
I look at you Krista,
and I see absolutely nothing.
Oh, maybe not nothing.
I suppose I do see
a hollow little girl
playing hollow little games.
The only thing
about you of any substance,
any real value, is this.
And it isn't even yours.
It is now.
At least you've finally found
the grace to accept one
of the many gifts
- you've been offered.
- Such as?
The gift of this House.
The gift of friendship
I've continually extended to you.
The gift
of healing.
Is that what this visit
is about Chase? Healing?
Or do you just want
your man back?
That's entirely up to you.
But I'd hate to think that
in the next few days
when so much change
is happening to the House.
You didn't have me
as your friend.
Because I know you don't
want me as your enemy.
Can I get back
to you on that?
Of course.
Let's just hope time
doesn't run out before you do!
Tic toc.
Next time on the
season finale of Blade.
You gotta get out, Marcus' people
are coming for you.
Give it up, Daywalker!
What are you doing?
Toying with you.
My final performance.
Where is the new place?
Waiting your touch.
I come bearing a magnificient gift.
The gift of a new dawn
for our House.

Do you know how unusual this is
to be here,
take these very steps.
One is usually only fortunate enough
to encounter history in his past tense.
A visit to ancient ruins.
Battlefields won and lost.
But to see it in advance,
to know that this place
in which you now stand
will become one
of monumental history.
And to know that your hand
will scratch out
the old world narrative.
Find a new one.
A end of a ***.
One of the mere infected
finally rising up against those
who keep us eternally
benath their feet.
And to know, it'll be your hand
that takes the favorite sword of Chthon.
The very symbol of their oppressive rule.
And uses it against them.
Or will.
With you right there by my side.
Is that where you want me?
Just as the first moment
we met.
You're sure?
I seem you to remember
the moment we met,
I was trying to kill you.
And I was intended upon having you.
Funny how things work out.
It does find a way, doesn't it?
It's all ready Marcus.
Everything installed,
your exact specifications.
New ventilation interface,
down in the security room,
large board duct,
with the AC system, and...
every door now requires laser
confirmation by retinal identity.
Identity confirmed.
Tucker Morfit.
What did I tell you?
- I'm good.
- Yes, you are.
I do apologize for
my outburst the other day.
Marcus, I'm just glad it wasn't
me you made your point on.
But I'm done with him, right?
His last task is
to show you out.
Have a safe trip on Tucker.
Your well deserved reward awaits you.
Until our next masterpiece.
It's all happening.
Everything you've worked so hard for,
is finally going to pay off.
Actually one last problem remains.
The same one
we always had it seems.
Blade.
What about him?
He has a habit of showing up
when least expected.
I thought Chthon would do
the same to him.
So,
where do we find him?
That's the best part.
I already have.
Blade The Series - 112 - Conclave
Blade?
Would you just sit tight?
I don't do that very well.
You said you wanted Marcus' plans
to be happening and they're happening.
I'm supposed to have
faith in him?
No, not in him, in Krista.
It's exactly why
you recruited her.
She can get in place
and we can't.
Or shouldn't if it screws
things up like right now.
So just chill.
She said she'd call
when the deed is done.
Seeing is believing.
Ah, I diddn't see this coming.
Ok.
Got any idea how we're gonna
get into that building?
Krista said they got
security up the ass.
I know someone who has a key.
Who is it?
It's her.
Krista?
You got to get out, Marcus'
people are coming for you.
They're already here.
Can you hear me? Blade?
Krista?
We're about to land.
Hum, be there in a second.
I'll tell you one thing,
no vamps aren't coming here
with UV lights in this place.
Now we're screwed.
Now  while we're still breathing.
Now we're screwed.
Give it up, Daywalker!
Do it.
Blow it up!
Come on!
Shit! I'm trying!
Your boyfriend's dead.
Guess you'll have to do.
What are you doing?
Toying with you.
Are you enjoying this, Chase?
Have you met our guest before?
Shen Lu-Wei,
Blade's weaponsmith ,
sidekick, ***,
take your pick.
If you think you can use
me as leverage.
We don't need you as leverage.
Blade is dead.
Have you found the body?
*** error on the man,
they don't have dick.
Assuming you're right, then you
represent nothing more than
a liability right now.
Blade wouldn't dream of compromising
his jihad in order to rescue you.
So why am I still alive?
Because you got knowledge.
They are operations that
still remain in existence.
An underground network
of hunters you traffic with.
You have names,
locations, methodologies,
all kinds of informations we can
pry from your skull before we bleed you out.
I need you to leave for
Toronto immediately.
Only to oversee every
aspects of tonight's operation.
Is that understood?
Well, let's begin.
I'm sorry?
Coercing our friend here into talking.
Choose use your poison.
Are  you meaning you
want me to...?
I presume you've encounted tortured
victims during your time in Iraq.
I'd imagine you have a fairly
extensive knowledge
of human pain thresholds.
Let me take care of this,
you've  got other business
to attend to, you should go.
There's time yet.
Enough for me to enjoy
a few more moments of this.
I'm sorry.
Just do it, you bloodsucking bitch.
Do it!!!
God!!!
If you don't start talking,
I'm gonna work on your teeth.
...
Good.
Maybe I'll start to hurt.
Krista?
I'm impressed.
Please, escalate.
My pleasure.
Sir, the plane is ready.
That's enough for now Krista.
You'll finish when
we return from Toronto.
In the meantime our friend
can meditate on his own mortality.
Come.
We have a revolution to start.
They totally destroyed the place.
Blade is dead.
Hey, we got the
little bitch of his.
I know, I know, I know.
Shit!
Later.
Got any toilet paper?
I was just kidding about that though.
So,
you're my reward, aren't you?
Take your time, I don't mind.
You do whatever Marcus tells you,
don't you?
We all have to.
Can't be too safe though?
You're gonna need
more protection than that.
Stay!
Wait, wait, wait!!! Ok, look!
Ok, ok, look!
I'll tel what Marcus is planning.
I'll tell you
where Chthon is meeting.
I already know.
But then, what the hell
do you want?
A way in.
Don't worry, I only need one.
Damn...
What did you say?
I said, sun's up.
Damn it!
I'm here Marcus,
rest assured,
everything is proceeding
as planned.
I'll be taking over security.
Chase,
I'm here on Marcus' orders.
Yes, and Marcus ordered me
to replace you.
- I didn't hear anything about...
- Or did he say remove you?!
Which would you prefer?
I'll go do the rounds.
That's prudent.
Lovely.
All we need now is
the Pure Bloods,
and the games can begin.
- Are you infected?
- No.
You wearing a wire or
some shit like that?
Not unless, they shoved it up
my ass when I wasn't looking.
Figured you were dead.
So did I,
until Krista slipped me
a little "pick me up".
Still can't believe you called.
One of us gets separated, it's every man for himself.
You know that.
Oh, I surprised you answered.
Now, are you gonna tell me
where you got this fine new ride?
Same place I got that.
- Their ETA?
- Five minutes.
Check on Chase.
Meet me upstairs.
Krista.
Get anything juicy
out of Blade's little helper?
Not yet.
Must not have squeezed hard enough.
Sounds to me like another job
I'll be required to finish.
Just get this one done first.
So that's it.
You came all this way
just to say that.
Do you roll over too?
Catch a ball.
You know Chase,
- you and I don't have to be like this.
- Too late, darling.
Now run along,
daddy will want you to fetch his sleepers.
They're here, aren't they?
Just staying at the door.
I can feel them.
Not for long.
Van Sciver.
Overlord Rusk, it is an honor to
gain an audience with all of you.
Almost all of us.
Yes,
Charlotte's passing came
as quite as surprise.
A terrible blow for Chthon.
A sacrifice.
But after tonight, one that will
not have been made in vain, yes?
I trust you've something
to present us?
Indeed.
We wait ***.
So,
what are we going in with?
A sword, one UV blade
and two guns!
And?
And that's it.
Great!
Oh, and one of the guns
might not work.
Oh, I'll take the other one, then.
Seriously bro,
what do you think our odds are?
Whatever they are.
They're even worse for Krista.
You actually care what happens to her?
I care because she's our way
into their world.
If she dies, Marcus goes with her.
And everything we worked
for goes up in smoke.
She got us tickets to
the Pure Blood ball.
If  Marcus survives, he gets upgraded.
So does Krista.
Then we move one notch up the
vampire foodchain, I get it.
You're just protecting our assets.
That's right.
Anyone I ever tell you
you're a  *** son of a bitch.
Every goddam day.
My fellow Pure Bloods,
we are the untainted.
The true.
And after tonight,
we will rule over even more
than the House of Chthon.
I thank you all for accepting
my invitation to convene.
Conclave is a rare occurence.
Even for our House.
The first among the Twelve.
And this is the time
of great sorrow.
A voice is missing from our table.
Silenced by tragic circumstance.
Nevertheless, I trust that
Charlotte joins us in spirit,
if not in form.
And this gathering accords
with our tradition.
We  meet only in times
of great urgency.
First, in year one
of our calendar,
convened by Lord Chthon himself
when he took this sword in hand,
and ended the tyranny
of our gender.
More recently,
we've met in
the ruins of Nagasaki.
In the winning days of
the Second World War,
our kind made unprecedented
advances amids the disarray
and dislocation.
Now we meet for
a different purpose.
True,
they are many pressing issues
for our House,
our eternal war against the humans.
Our recent hostilities
against the House of Erebus
and the returning pollution of
the Armayans back to the vampire nation.
Don't forget the worst filth of all.
Identity confirmed.
Tucker Morfit.
After tonight,
Blade will no longer be
a factor in the great game.
How can you be so sure?
Because tonight,
we all become daywalkers.
Tonight,
we take possession of a weapon
that will ciment our domination
of the other Houses.
The fruit
of Charlotte's final project
begun nearly a decade ago
finally birthed then brought
to us from beyond her grave :
Aurora.
Your prop.
To my final performance.
Everything ready on the ***?
Perfectly.
Yours?
Poison in place.
Awaiting your touch.
In a very short while,
the three of us will leave that
room upstairs and with it
the old House of Chthon.
Now I know that your relationship
has had its difficulties.
I just hope all that
can be put behind us.
Because we are about
to walk into a new world.
And there is just simply no one,
I would rather take those
first few steps with.
And the two of you...
Sir?
The Overlord is ready for you.
And so will I to ***.
What's he doing back in here?
Van Sciver asked to make
the presentation in
Charlotte's absence.
He's a turned blood.
Under the circumstances, I'm...
willing to make an exception.
Just this once.
Thank you, Lord Rusk.
And I thank all of you
for your indulgence.
I am honored to have had
the opportunity to prepare
this site for this...
Oh, get on with it, Van Sciver.
We’re far too old to be moved
by your honey-voiced ass-kissing.
And remember,
you might have built this room.
But that doesn't mean a turned blood
like you belongs here.
Or ever will.
Of course.
But I assure you I come bearing
a magnificient gift.
The gift of a new dawn
for our House.
A real dawn.
One that will allow each and every
one of you to experience things
that you never have before.
To be what you never have been.
Kill 'em all.
Familiars too.
I was hoping for something
more specific.
The security room is
like *** poison gaz.
- We'll start there and work our way up.
- And when we get to the top?
Kill more vampires.
I'm  awarr some of you had doubts when
Charlotte presented my proposal
for Aurora's development.
And it did take many years,
and many millions of dollars to perfect.
But what I bring tonight is
a prize unlike anything our House
or any other Houses has ever seen.
Enough theater Marcus,
just give us what
you came to give us.
Happily.
The vaccine you've
all been expecting.
The magical cure that will conquer
our genetic weakness to garlic,
silver and sunlight.
It never worked.
But don't worry.
I've come to deliver
what you really deserve.
Shit!
Well done, Marcus, well done!
You almost had me actually believing
that Aurora wasn't the lie that
you've been selling all this time.
The same lie that forced you
to blow up Charlotte's plane.
Friends,
I apologize for not informing
you of this subterfuge sooner.
We thought it was important
that Marcus revealed himself.
We?
We!
Chase!
Charlotte gave me
a simple choice, Marcus.
You or the House of Chthon.
And as much as I've grown
to care for you,
I decided it was more prudent
to bet on the House.
After everything I gave to you.
And everything you didn't.
Chase!
Chase, no.
Marcus belongs to us.
The vents are screwed.
There's no delivery system
for the poison.
Yes, there is, me.
Get the other two working.
And then get your ass up there.
What a delightful
way top end the evening?
Drinking the blood of a traitor.
After you've watched him die,
you belong to me.
Can't have a party without a keg.
Screw this!
Just stay cool pal,
and no one dies.
I forgot the one
that doesn't work.
I should have let him kill you, Van Sciver.
It's nice to meet you too, Blade.
Who belongs to who now, bitch!
Shit!
Damn it!
Identity confirmed.
Is it about a man, Chase?
You're such a girl!
This isn't about Marcus.
This is about me moving up
in the world.
Sorry, sweetie!
I only see you going down!
That's the relic of Chthon?
Why am I not surprised
it's a piece of shit!
Blade!
Your death will make
this night complete.
Krista!
Shen!
Don't try to tell me
that was a win.
Pure Bloods dead is a win.
Marcus further up the ladder is a win.
Krista still with him...
- is a win.
- Yeah, yeah, for how long?!
- Because you know the deeper
she goes!
- She can handle it.
Anyone ever tell you you're
an optimistic son of a bitch.
Every goddam day!
Marcus, what are we doing here?
Just tying up loose ends.
Blade was a thorn in my sight
for quite some time.
It caused to people considerable
troubles over the years.
And now he's gone.
For now.
They're going underground, eventually
re-emerge in some other city.
Won't you have to do the same?
I mean, the Pure Bloods
are gonna be looking for you now.
No doubt,
but they'll have to be cautious.
I have the great equalizer.
The weapon which targets the royal
blood but yet leaves the rest of us
turned safe and sound.
The atom bomb is at my disposal.
They'll have no choice
but to acceed to my demands.
Which are what?
Rule Chthon, first of all.
The entire House.
Never in the history of our people
has a turned blood been able to top it all.
Now one is.
I promise you,
things will be very different
from here on out.
Especially now that
Chase is dead.
We don't know that for certain.
Come on Marcus,
I saw her drop a dozen storeys.
Even if I saw her ash!
Even if I had my hand
with her reminants.
I would still watch my back
for the rest of my years on earth!
Can I ask you something?
Anything.
How did you find out where
Blade was operating from?
Who told you about
this location?
Blade
has a network of people
working with him.
Informants, ashers,
people who traffic
on both sides of the fence.
We were able to intercept
a phone call last week.
We traced it.
Followed this person here.
The rest was simplicity.
Now I have a question for you.
How long have you
been working for Blade?
