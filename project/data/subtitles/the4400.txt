I don't think it's gonna clear up.
It won't last long.
It's not raining that hard.
- It was so nice this morning.
- Yeah. It'll clear up.
If it doesn't,
we'll just have a picnic in the car.
Daddy, I want to go outside and play.
You're gonna get all wet, sweetie.
- Maybe later.
- Please.
It's a very light shower.
Please, I won't get wet.
OK. But for just a minute.
- And I want you to come right back.
- I promise.
- Have fun.
- I will.
We treated you as an equal.
That wasn't enough.
You had to cross the line.
I'd put in for a transfer if I were you.
- Where are you going for dinner?
- Chez Michael's.
That's gonna set you back.
Elizabeth has been married to me
for 35 years.
- She deserves a nice meal.
- Have a good evening, Orson.
You need to slow down. I'm not
driving into town for another six-pack.
You're afraid my Dad will kick your ass
if I smell like beer.
Evil cousin Shawn. That's me.
Corruptor of the innocent.
Your neighbour. What's her name?
- She seems ready for some corruption.
- You mean Nikki?
- She's 14, Kyle.
- 14?
- Yeah.
- Hmm.
Hmm.
Would it be fair
to say that this comet
is close in size to Haley's Comet,
or is it a little bigger?
As far as comets go,
this one's a little smaller than Haley's.
But what makes this interesting to us
is how close it will pass by Earth.
What are the projections
on how close it will get?
Hey, kiddo. You're missing the show.
It's a big comet.
NASA says we'll never see one closer
in our lifetime.
Yeah, I didn't think that would work.
Hi.
- How is he?
- Same.
Same as always.
Some of your mail's
still coming to the house.
I'll call the post office.
Hi, baby.
I haven't seen you for a few days.
I can't make it every day. Not any more.
Not after three years.
Are we supposed to just give up on him?
I better go.
Linda, just wait. Linda!
- Linda!
- It's not a competition, Tom!
It's not about who can
sit by his side the longest.
I still love him.
I just can't live here like you do.
I know. I wasn't accusing you.
You got a bill from Olympian
Investigations. More private detectives?
We were onto something.
Someone matching Shawn's description.
But it wasn't him, was it?
Shawn could be anywhere. Even if you
found him, it wouldn't wake Kyle up.
- At least I'd have some answers.
- I'm worried about you, Tom.
Finding Shawn and figuring out
what happened to our son is my job.
How can you not know that?
You look tired.
Try and get some rest.
I thought we were watching the comet.
Oh, yeah, the comet.
Is it supposed to be that bright?
- Skouris.
- Get over here. Now.
This cannot be good.
Listen up, everyone. We're Defcon One.
These envelopes are orders
from HomeSec.
Our first priority is secure SeaTac
Airport, ground all the planes.
Gather up all the foreign dignitaries
in the area.
Get them, the local elected officials,
take them all to the shelters.
- Sid, bring me up to speed.
- The comet's not a flyby any more.
It's heading right at us.
Sir, it just changed course again.
- A comet can't change course.
- It has.
- Then it's not a comet.
- Velocity is...
- 3,000kms a second.
- How long do we have?
- Impact in 28 minutes.
- Sir.
Ryland.
Understood.
China just launched its missiles at it.
We're going next.
The US military has launched
a volley of 24 Titan Two missiles.
Danny, what's going on?
All right, our missiles are in the air.
- England launched.
- France. Russia.
The first flight of missiles will intercept
in 15 seconds.
Nine... eight... seven...
six... five... four...
...three... two... one...
We should get inside.
Multiple hits. I think they got it.
At least nine of the missiles have hit
their target. The comet has...
- It's still headed for us.
- How hard will it hit?
Something that big, that fast...
You don't want to know.
You don't want to know.
I'm scared.
I'm gonna go find my parents, OK?
Hey, Dad, if you're there,
can you pick up the phone?
It's Diana. You know, your daughter?
- Just tell my brother that I love him.
- Tell Mummy that I love her, OK?
Nancy, it's Dad.
I just wanted to tell you I love you.
Impact with Earth now appears...
Tom, it's Susan. What is going on?
Isn't there a shelter we can go to?
You still work for Homeland Security.
Susan, it doesn't matter.
Shelters aren't gonna make
a damn bit of difference. Just...
I'm sorry. I love you, sis.
Just hug Danny close
and pray for the best.
A British missile hit the object,
but it's still coming.
- It's entered the atmosphere.
- I got it on radar.
- It's slowing down.
- What?
It's at Mach seven. Mach two.
It's going subsonic.
It's continuing to lose speed.
It's as if it's coming in for a landing.
- What? Like a plane?
- No, more like the mother ship.
Give me some coordinates.
Where's it going?
47 north longitude,
122, maybe 123 west latitude.
That's by Mount Rainier.
That's our backyard.
Come on, get the shot!
We're at Mount Rainier.
The ball of light is massive.
100, 200 feet in diameter.
It's hard to tell. We'll try to get closer.
I can tell you that this is,
without a doubt,
one of the most incredible sights
I've ever seen.
We're looking for an official
from the government.
Jim? Jim, now, what's going on?
We're not sure what's just happened.
The ball of light is gone.
Thousands of people have just
suddenly appeared! This is amazing.
There are thousands of people.
- I think I just... I saw your brother!
- Shawn?
Yeah!
Pull me all the files
from the northern counties.
I want back in.
Tom, do you have any idea
what I'm wading through here?
Over 4,000 people stepped
out of a ball of light and landed in my lap.
Some have been gone 60 years, none
have any memory of what happened.
- And you want back in?
- I can help.
I needed help from you before.
When HomeSec asked me
who I wanted from the Bureau,
your name was at the top of the list.
- What did I get from you?
- Five months.
Five months.
Then an indefinite leave of absence.
You made fools of both of us.
I needed to know what happened
to my son.
And that's the reason you want back in.
Your nephew is one of the returnees.
I admit I have a personal stake in this.
That's why I'll come through for you.
I need answers, too.
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
You'll be investigating
what happened to the returnees.
- Skouris. Ex-CDC, right?
- Yeah, I heard of you, too.
- You're kidding.
- Is there a problem?
He went MIA once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
Me.
Is this where you say,
"Be a good soldier"?
No, this is where I say
you're my best field scientist
and Tom is my best lead investigator,
and together
you're gonna make a good team.
Well, it should be interesting.
Huh. Nice to meet you, too.
Beautiful. The sooner we find out
what's going on, the better for us.
The better for them.
- What's your name?
- Julius.
- Anita.
- Amanda.
I wanna see my family.
Orson Bailey.
- It's not possible.
- Fine, it's 1979.
- So for them, no time has past.
- Last night was our anniversary.
So where do you think they've been?
I don't know. There had to be
some kind of intelligence behind it.
Is it the hand of God or little green men?
I'm not discounting anything.
Look. This is an interesting one.
- They're dead, aren't they?
- This is Maia Rutledge.
She was the first one to disappear.
She's eight, only she was born in 1938.
I'll be OK. Mostly.
She's a tough little kid.
There's a returnee
I'd like to interview myself.
Yeah, so I've been told. Returnee 2,117.
Shawn Farrell. He's all yours.
We just want access.
They deserve to see their families,
to receive representation.
- They've done nothing wrong.
- We don't know that.
These people could be walking
time bombs, disease vectors, spies.
She doesn't like us much.
The feeling's mutual.
- The secretary of state is coloured?
- Black. I'll take your word for it.
And the national security advisor, too.
The world sure has changed since '51.
You should try to relax.
You won't get out any quicker
by wearing a groove in the floor.
- Are you a jailhouse philosopher?
- Barracks philosopher.
I was a combat pilot in Korea.
- Nice tattoo. Who's Lily?
- A girl I used to know.
Shawn Farrell to interview room one.
See you.
- What's your name, sir?
- Orson Bailey.
I want to speak to someone in charge.
Why can't I make a call?
Uncle Tommy! Hi!
It's good to see you!
What's going on?
Nobody will tell us anything.
We'll let you know
as soon as we find out. I...
- I can't believe it's you.
- How do you think I feel?
Do you know how long they're gonna
keep us? I really want to go home.
Shawn, er...
Do you remember anything? Anything
at all about what happened that night?
Nothing.
Nothing.
One minute I'm sitting
with Kyle on the beach,
the next it's three years later
and I'm standing next to a mountain
with a couple thousand strangers
around me.
Listen, Uncle Tommy,
some people are saying that...
we were abducted by aliens.
We can't rule anything out yet.
Well, can you give me anything?
- How's my mum? How's Danny?
- Fine.
- They miss you.
- Great.
What about Kyle? He must have seen
something the night I disappeared.
Did he tell you anything?
- He hasn't said a word.
- He's OK, isn't he?
- Isn't he?
- Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.
What are you talking about?
Kyle's lying on a bed being fed through
one tube and pissing out another,
and he's been like that
ever since the night you left.
He was fine.
We were having a couple of beers.
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.
I've waited three years
to hear the truth from you
so please don't lie to me.
I just told you the truth.
Is that what you've been thinking
this whole time?
That I gave Kyle something
that messed him up and I just took off?
Screw you, Uncle Tommy.
I just told you everything I know.
Goddamn it!
You look as bored as I feel.
I wish there were windows in this place.
I'd like to see the stars. Wouldn't you?
- Do I look that bad?
- No, it's...
You remind me of someone
I used to know.
- How long have you been gone?
- Since '51.
Wouldn't be me, then. '93.
- I'm Richard.
- Lily.
My friend. Her name was Lily, too.
Lily Bonham.
That's my grandmother's name.
- Lily Bonham from St Louis?
- You knew my grandmother.
- Is she still alive?
- I'm sorry.
She died before I was born.
Are you all right?
Lily's dead and I'm sitting here
with her granddaughter.
Doesn't make any goddamn sense at all.
I know how you feel.
I keep thinking I'll wake up
and tell my husband all about this dream.
- You have a family?
- Yeah.
Brian and I and our daughter, Heidi.
She was six months when I...
So what was she like? My grandmother.
Everyone says I look a lot like her.
They were right.
- That's not possible right now.
- This is ridiculous.
You've got no right to hold us.
We haven't done anything wrong.
I'm sorry.
This is for you.
We're letting them go? They've only
been back six weeks. It's too soon.
The court of appeal's upheld a lawsuit
by the ACLU on behalf of the families.
- We have no right to hold them.
- Some of them have no place to go.
Egypt and China won't repatriate
its citizens. India's on the fence.
Whoever wants to stay can stay.
American citizens who leave
will get the assistance required
to get their life on track -
Medicare, Unemployment,
rent vouchers, vocational training.
- We need to isolate these people.
- They're human beings not viruses.
The order's been given.
We're letting them go.
I wouldn't book your vacations just yet.
Each Homeland Security office
will be responsible for the returnees
in their region.
We'll be monitoring 79 people
plus another 135 who have chosen
to remain in quarantine for now.
Each returnee will check in once a week.
Any difficulties faced by our returnees
will be handled by this office.
Finally, we'll continue
with our investigation.
We'll all sleep better once we know
what the hell's going on. Thank you.
You look so lonely without an ID number.
I'm supposed to be 82 years old.
There's no one here waiting for me.
So what are you going to do?
Head back to the old neighbourhood,
I suppose. What about you?
Wait. Let me guess.
- Take your daughter to Woodland Park.
- We used to love that place.
Of course, Heidi was barely crawling
then, and now she's twelve.
Er...
You've been a good friend.
- They said there'd be a bus to the city.
- Right over there.
- Hey, Mum! Danny!
- Shawn!
Brian! Brian!
Sorry, I...
Let's go.
- Can I help you?
- Heidi?
- Yeah.
- Heidi, it's Mummy.
- Who?
- Heidi?
It's OK, sweetie. I got it.
Brian.
Lily.
Look at you. You haven't aged a day.
Why didn't you come and pick me up?
Didn't they contact you?
Yeah.
You have to understand. I didn't think
I was ever going to see you again.
I'm married, Lily.
Carol has been a really good mother
to Heidi.
We have a son now, too. A little boy.
I'm sorry, Lil, I'm...
Lily...
Elizabeth.
Orson?
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.
I know.
Where's the car?
We're going to be late for dinner.
I'm sorry, hon.
Things got a little out of control.
But it won't happen again.
- Hey, Mum.
- It's good to see you!
Oh, hey, Joel. Good to see you.
Sorry your buddies couldn't show.
I guess they're away at college.
They're jealous I get to enjoy
two more years of high school.
High school's not that bad. Hey, Shawn.
- Remember me?
- Nikki?
No!
Last time I saw you
you were just a little kid.
- Lucky me, huh?
- Yeah, I guess so.
What the hell are you looking at?
- I used to live here.
- Yeah?
Well, I live here now.
Get the hell outta here.
- Why am I here?
- To put a human face on the returnees.
To remind you they're people,
not viruses.
- Tom. Who is your new friend?
- This is my partner. My work partner.
Diana Skouris, this is my wife Linda.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
We're separated.
Call me. We need to talk.
- Well, that was awkward.
- Really? I hadn't noticed.
Give me a second.
- You look thirsty.
- Thank you.
I just wanted you to know,
I really am glad you're back.
Whatever. You...
Jeez.
- Neck's broken.
- Reflection must have confused him.
Come back inside.
You're missing your own party.
It's just weird being in there...
- I guess he was just stunned.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I guess so.
- See you in there.
I have to see the doctor every week?
It doesn't sound like much fun
to me either but...
you get to live with these lovely people.
And that beats a bunk in quarantine,
right?
- There's nothing we can't handle, right?
- That would be nice.
We should get going. It's a bit of a drive.
Terrific. Good luck, Maia.
- You'll see me again.
- Yeah. Next week.
Sooner than that.
When we bought the building,
your mother said, "That old thing?"
- Can I get you anything?
- Water would be fine.
Mary, get Mr Bailey some water?
Just down here.
You look exactly the same
as the last time I saw you.
And you were 13. Your father asked me
to show you the ropes.
Looks like I succeeded.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
So what can I do for you, Mr Bailey?
My old corner office for starters,
a secretary, some business cards.
I can start seeing clients in a week.
- You're looking for a job?
- This is still Kensington and Bailey.
I'm embarrassed.
Times are tight. I just had to lay off
three of my actuaries.
- I don't have any openings right now.
- "Openings"? I'm a partner here.
Your interest was bought out
when you were declared dead.
I'm not dead.
- It is all legal.
- Don't be too sure of that.
What happened to me,
there is no precedent.
But it might be years
until precedent is established.
Until that happens, all of you... returnees
will have to plead your case
in front of a judge.
- Do you have the...
- Have you seen where my wife is?
I have to get her out of there.
I need money. Now.
The living room.
There's the kitchen.
Do you want to see your room?
It's the one over here.
- Here.
- We just had it redone.
It's a very nice room.
I got you a few outfits. Tomorrow
you can pick out some more yourself.
OK.
Maia, honey.
We have a rule.
No shoes on the furniture.
- I don't want them to get wet.
- Wet?
Why would they get wet?
Why don't you get cleaned up?
We're gonna eat soon.
Anita?
Adam, it's Orson. Let me in.
I want to talk.
I know you can hear. Let me in!
You want me to wake
the whole neighbourhood?
- Tom.
- What are you doing here?
Your phone is off.
Ryland wants us to come in.
- What's up?
- There's been a murder.
The police are holding one of the 4400.
That's Orson Bailey.
Bailey. Some kind of businessman,
right?
- Life insurance.
- Disappeared in the '70s.
'79. Declared dead in '86.
Seattle police are holding him
in connection with a homicide.
- They know he's one of the 4400?
- Bailey told them.
The returnees were told
not to discuss their status.
We counsel them to avoid it
if they can
but we were talking interviews
and applications.
There's no protocol for murder enquiries.
- You said holding not charging?
- Right.
There are conflicting reports
about what went on.
- We'll check it out.
- Quietly.
- I don't want to dodge microphones.
- Quietly it is.
Diana.
Hi, this is Linda. I can't take your call
right now but please leave a message.
Linda, it's me again.
You said we needed to talk
so pick up the phone.
Linda, come on.
All right, call me.
- Everything OK?
- Same old same old.
I wish she'd make up her mind.
- I had a boyfriend once. Every...
- Boyfriend?
Well, don't look so surprised.
- Yeah, anyway. The thing about...
- You can stop.
I barely got started.
You don't have to try
to make me feel better.
It was more of an attempt at bonding
via a shared similar experience.
Can you open the door?
How long did you go out with this guy?
- Nine months.
- Nine months.
You're equating your nine months
with my 19 years.
You're right. OK. Forget it.
You want me to drive?
- What for?
- So you can brood.
Just get in.
Look who floated in on a ball of light.
- Remember me, Farrell?
- Rossi. Hi.
Looks like the steroids finally kicked in.
Funny, man. Always did appreciate
your sense of humour.
Like when you sold me those tickets.
To the Foo Fighters?
How was the show?
Cops were waiting for me
when I showed up.
The tickets were stolen. I got arrested.
- You got arrested for stolen tickets?
- Yeah. I had five tabs of X on me.
I had to pee in a cup once a week
for two years.
- Stop it!
- Get off of him!
- It's between me and your brother.
- I say it's between you and me.
See you round, freak.
By the way, I like the new paint job
on your ride.
Are you OK?
Fine.
The cameras caught everything.
He had a bug up his ass.
But he never went inside.
Kensington fell and impaled himself.
- You've seen all the footage?
- Yes.
- Bailey never made it past the gate.
- Hold on. Did you see that?
- That's glass.
- Yeah.
Something blew out the windows
from the inside.
We're trying to figure that out.
There was no seismic activity,
no bomb or gas leak.
- And Bailey's not talking?
- I've sent half a dozen guys in.
He hasn't given us anything.
I've been over and over this
with you people.
We're Homeland Security.
Tell the bozos out there I had nothing
to do with what happened to Adam.
Let's go over your day.
You went to see Adam about a job.
Even though your name is still
on the letterhead, he brushed you off.
- I know how that'd make me feel.
- I admit I was angry.
I went to Adam's house to...
I don't know why I went.
But I didn't kill him.
Let me read you an e-mail Kensington
sent his attorney after your visit.
It's not important.
"Bailey is making claims
regarding his stake in the company.
"He threatened to sue. There will be
hundreds of law suits involving the 4400.
"It'll take years. Poor bastard.
He really is rather a pathetic case."
I am not a lawyer
but I'm not an idiot either.
You've had me here for twelve hours.
Either you charge me with something...
...or let me go.
- We're gonna let him walk?
- Looks like it.
If I ever want to play good cop, bad cop,
I'll let you know.
- Which one am I?
- This isn't a joke.
There's a time to lean on a guy.
That wasn't it.
Look, I'm sorry. But Bailey admitted
he was angry with Kensington.
- He was at his house.
- I didn't say it was over, did I?
Do you think they thought about me?
Oh, sweetie! They were your parents!
I am sure that they thought about you
every day.
Thanks for bringing me here.
This place used to be so nice.
Now the kids leave garbage everywhere.
- It's a shame.
- You don't have to worry.
- Crown Ridge is nice.
- Crown Ridge Cemetery?
Yes.
- That's where you will be.
- Be? Be what?
Buried.
Kensington is a popular guy today.
The whole staff's seen the post mortem.
Why is that?
He might have been a boring suit alive,
but in death, he's a rock star.
God, look at that.
Those were his parietal bones?
We've seen terrible beating deaths.
One guy jumped off the Space Needle
and was brought to us in a garbage bag.
But I have never seen a skull
in this kind of shape before.
- Thousands of tiny bone fragments...
- He was impaled.
- That's not how he died?
- That would have killed him.
But he was already dead
from his shattered skull.
- Hello.
- Hello, is Lily there?
- Who?
- Is this Heidi?
Yes.
I'm Richard Tyler.
A friend of your mother's.
My mother's name is Carol.
Are you sure you have the right number?
This is the Moore residence, isn't it?
Yeah, but there's
no one named Lily here. Sorry.
I'm afraid I can't give you
any medicine for the nausea.
- Why not?
- Because it wouldn't work.
You're not sick, Lily, you're pregnant.
That's impossible. The quarantine
doctors would have told me.
They gave you a full screening
seven weeks ago.
If you'd just conceived
it wouldn't have shown.
Conceived? When?
I assume, right before you disappeared.
But there's no mistake.
You're definitely pregnant.
There's nothing to worry about.
But I'd like to see you again next week
when you're used to the information.
- Shawn.
- Hey.
- How are you doin'?
- Good.
- Did you get your car fixed?
- It'll be in the shop for a week.
Yeah? Danny and I are going to a party
tonight at Evie Chobin's house.
You should come.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
They're gonna be listening to music
I've never heard,
talking about movies I've never seen.
School is bad enough.
Partying with runts from...
Is that how you saw me? A runt?
- You were 14, Nikki.
- And now?
I'm late for class.
Where's my wife?
- My wife. Where is she?
- You have our deepest condolences.
- We called. There was no answer.
- Elizabeth?
It was a pulmonary embolism.
We tried to revive her.
- No!
- Please, calm down.
- She's dead?
- Mr Bailey!
- She's all I have.
- Let go of me!
- Let go of me! Please!
- No!
Get away from me!
So the dots are where the American
members of the 4400 originally lived.
- You mean the returnees.
- According to the press, it's "the 4400".
You have to admit it's a bit strange,
a nice round number like that.
I wonder if it has any significance.
So if 3,781 people had shown up that
night it wouldn't have been as strange?
I'd say slightly less strange.
This, however, is downright weird.
Here's where the 4400 are now,
two weeks after their release.
- 65% are still in Seattle.
- They're just not going home.
- And none of them can say why.
- You think it means something?
In the CDC we'd call this
a statistically significant disease cluster.
In the FBI we'd call it a coincidence.
I don't believe in coincidences.
Disease clusters...
I believe in those.
- You're pregnant?
- Yes.
When you disappeared
I'd been in New York for weeks.
I haven't been with anyone else.
- We're talking immaculate conception?
- I don't know. I wish I did.
You know, when you disappeared,
I'd have given anything to talk to you.
I'd have whole conversations with you
in my head.
I missed you so much, Lil.
But we can't do this.
I have another family now.
I know that's not fair but...
I am part of your life
whether you want me to be or not.
You haven't been part of my life
for 11 years.
I want to see Heidi.
- That's impossible.
- She's my daughter.
She doesn't know that.
She thinks that Carol is her mother.
- You never told her about me?
- She was a baby.
- We were babies.
- You can't stop me from seeing her.
I already have.
- What is that?
- It's a temporary restraining order.
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- I'm a lawyer.
I know how to work the system.
I will only use this if you force me to.
- My priority is protecting my family.
- I am your family.
I wish you were.
But you're not. Not any more.
I'm sorry, Lil. I'm asking you,
please stay away from Heidi.
And from me.
I'm sorry, Lily.
At first I thought it was an earthquake.
Everything was shaking.
Then... I can't believe
I'm going to say this...
Things started to fly around the room.
Paper. Chairs.
- What do you mean, "fly"?
- I mean, fly, like it was a tornado.
Except there was no wind.
Everybody was screaming.
My head felt like it was gonna burst.
Then suddenly it was over.
- What about Bailey?
- He looked scared. Like the rest of us.
That's when he ran away. The staff...
Everyone's saying
he's one of these people. The 4400.
- Is that true?
- Listen to me very carefully.
You are not going to talk about this
to the press.
If I see this reported on the news,
we'll take an interest in this place.
- Things flying around the room?
- All the witnesses say the same.
Flying? I've got to do a briefing
for HomeSec DC and I'll tell him what?
"The incident is under investigation."
Bailey checked out of his hotel.
He could be on the run.
Find him. You bought us some time
but this story's gonna leak
and I want Bailey in our hands
before it does.
So is Calculus
everything you remember it to be?
You heard about Williams
and Miss Sinclair?
- No? They found them in the closet.
- What?
- Making out, not dead.
- What?
Everybody's been talking about it.
Yo, freak. Still hiding behind
your little brother?
You know what, Brad?
You need to shut it down.
You want to shut me down?
The only thing I'm shutting down
is you, bitch.
- You're starting to piss me off.
- Come on. Bring it.
Shut me down.
- Let him go!
- Shawn!
What did you do to him?
- I don't want her here any more.
- Hey! She'll hear you.
It's bad enough she says we'll be buried
there, but then we get a brochure?
It's a coincidence.
Look, she's not what we expected,
so let's just talk to her.
Yeah.
Maia...
It's OK. I knew
I wasn't going to be here very long.
Come on. Come on, let's go.
Give me the ball.
- Your shot, space boy.
- What is your problem?
- What is my problem?
- Yeah, what's your problem?
- What did you do to Brad?
- Not you, too. Come on.
The way he went down?
That's not normal.
You know it, I know it.
Everybody saw it.
- What are you saying?
- You tell me.
I didn't do anything to him, all right?
Not a thing.
Is this all that's left when you're done?
Poor Mrs Bailey. It's a box of trinkets.
They're not trinkets. They're memories.
The kind you leave behind,
for family, friends.
- I should get to work on that.
- I'm not going there.
Believe it or not,
some of us are happier alone.
If anyone thinks they're happy alone,
they're kidding themselves.
I thought you weren't going there.
You see this? This looks promising.
"Wyler Summer Cabin."
Wyler was Elizabeth's maiden name.
Orson's panicking,
he needs a place to run.
- There's no address.
- We'll have to find one.
It's better this way. For everyone.
Everyone? Or just you?
Maia, honey. You know this isn't
about you. You are a wonderful girl.
It's just... Kenneth and I...
We just made a mistake.
We're not ready to be parents yet.
- It's OK.
- No, it's not.
But sweetie, those things you say.
They can scare people if
you're not careful. Do you understand?
Good.
For you.
Come on. Take it.
- What is it?
- A CD I burned.
Think of it as a crash course
in all things new and cool.
- The bands you've never heard of.
- Thanks.
But Nikki, I could listen to all the music
and watch all the shows,
but they'll still think I'm different.
But you'll be listening to good music.
I don't understand, see. Everybody has
been looking at me like I'm a monster.
But you...
Aren't you afraid to be seen with me?
No. What do I care
what those creeps think?
If you like the CD,
I'll burn you another one.
- Sounds great.
- All right. OK.
- See you.
- Talk to you later.
OK. Bring up the satellite shots.
So we're looking for a small house
with a north-facing exposure
somewhere near Appleton Lake.
- If it's still standing.
- No structures in grids 1, 2, 3 and 9.
4 and 7 each have one
but they're the wrong shape.
- Eliminate all those.
- That leaves us with 5, 6 and 8.
That's too small.
That's the wrong orientation.
That's too small. That's too big.
It's not there anymore.
Hang on. Get a little tighter on this.
It looks like it could be a house.
These trees would be huge by now.
Enlarge again.
- Bingo. There's your house.
- Bingo.
Appleton is what, about 70 miles?
Yeah. And look, when we get up there...
- I'll handle Bailey.
- All right.
- Are we leaning on him?
- No leaning.
- No problem.
- Excuse me, are you Tom Baldwin?
Yeah. Who are you?
You've been served. Sorry, man.
You're getting sued?
Linda's filed for divorce.
- Over this way.
- Get ready.
- Lily.
- Richard!
Richard!
I don't understand.
I thought you went home.
I did but there was nothing there for me.
How did you find me here?
Woodland Park, right?
This is where you used to bring Heidi.
Richard, it was terrible.
Brian's married
and Heidi doesn't know I exist.
- Hello, Maia.
- Hello.
Oh, I like it out here.
It's much better than my stuffy office.
But you didn't bring me out here
to talk about the weather.
- You're a very smart little girl.
- Thank you.
The thing is that the Griffins didn't give
a reason why they brought you back.
Maybe they didn't have a reason.
It could be.
- Were they mean to you?
- No.
- Were you mean to them?
- No.
Why do you think you're back here?
I don't think they like kids much.
Why do you say that?
They brought me back and I'm a kid.
You don't really want to tell me
the reason, do you?
It's OK.
Maybe you'll change your mind one day.
Maybe.
Hi, this is Linda. I can't take your call
right now but please leave a message.
- She's still not answering?
- Nope.
- Can I ask you a question?
- No.
I'm gonna ask you anyway.
Your son.
How long has he been in a coma?
Three years.
- That's a long time.
- You have no idea.
Maybe you and your wife
can work things out.
One day Kyle will wake up and I'll have
to tell him his family's fallen apart.
I go to that hospital every day and I tell
myself that makes me a good father.
You are a good father.
Kyle's lucky to have a dad like you.
Not everyone does.
You can trust me cos I know.
A baby?
Are you sure?
I had the doctors do the tests
three times.
The thing is that Brian was out of town
when I disappeared
and I haven't been with anyone
since I've been back.
- I don't understand. How could you...
- I don't know.
I'm sorry to dump this on you.
It's not really fair.
It's OK. I...
I want to help.
There's some sort of connection
between us, isn't there?
- I feel it.
- I can feel it, too.
That's why I came back.
But it's more complicated than that.
Your grandmother and I...
We weren't just friends.
It was... It was more than that.
We were gonna start a family.
I think part of me already knew that.
The way you talk about her.
The look in your eye.
I thought I was playing it so safe.
It must have been difficult. A white
woman and a black man in the '50s.
Hmm. "Black."
Back then I was "Negro"
or "coloured" or worse.
But we didn't care.
We figured after the war
we'd take off to some big city
like Chicago or New York or Paris.
- But you never made it home.
- No.
I never did.
I'm glad you found me.
Me too.
Mr Bailey, it's Tom Baldwin,
Homeland Security.
We met at the police station, remember?
We're here to help.
You've got to talk to us.
- Go away.
- We can't do that.
I just want to be left alone.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Good cos we don't want
anyone else hurt.
If you leave, I promise
no one will ever see me again.
I'll just stay here away from everyone.
You know that's not going to work.
Open the door.
We can figure this out.
I'm on your side.
No, you're not. No one is.
My nephew is one of the 4400
just like you.
It's hard for him. It's harder for you.
You don't know anything. My wife.
She was everything to me.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- I don't want any pity.
Go away! I just want to be left alone.
- We can't do that.
- I said... get away from me.
Stay away. Please.
Tom!
Your nose!
I can't control it.
Whatever it is you're doing, stop it!
- I can't control it!
- Stop it! Now!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
- I'll call for an ambulance.
- OK.
We're gonna get you some help,
Mr Bailey.
Just don't die on me.
Well, he's alive, but he won't be
talking to us any time soon.
As far as the public's concerned,
we'll deny it ever happened.
But we know better.
The question is, will it happen again?
You suggest we put them all
back in quarantine?
You saw what Bailey could do.
And you felt it, same as me.
Who knows what they rest of them
are capable of?
I sure as hell don't.
But then again it's not my job to find out.
It's yours.
Aren't you glad you wanted back in?
I never thanked you for saving my life.
You know, I never shot anyone before.
- Seeing him lying there like that...
- Are you OK?
I'll get there. You know, I meant
what I said to Ryland back there.
Who knows where all this is going?
We've got one case.
Maybe that's all we'll ever have.
You haven't noticed anything unusual
with Shawn?
I just need to know
if you had you'd tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
Look at this guy.
There's three other sites
just like this one.
- What are you guys doing?
- Research.
- On The 4400 Scoop. Com?
- It's just...
You know the Web.
There's a site for everything.
"The 4400 Menace?" I know this guy.
I was in quarantine with him.
They're saying he killed someone
just by thinking about it.
- So that makes me some kind of freak?
- No. No, we were just...
I want to know
how you took Brad down so fast.
- Come on, you saw it.
- Danny.
You have no idea
what you're talking about.
Neither do you.
Shawn.
What?
You were thinking the same thing.
Previously on "The 4400".
Listen up, everyone.
We're Defcon One.
- It's not a flyby.
- A comet can't change course.
- This one has.
- Then it's not a comet.
There appears
to be something out there.
The light has gone and thousands
of people have suddenly appeared.
Finding Shawn and figuring out
what happened to our son is my job.
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
You will be one of the teams responsible
for investigating the returnees.
What about my parents?
They're dead, aren't they?
This is Maia Rutledge. She's eight
years old, only she was born in 1938.
No time has passed.
Returnee 2,117, Shawn Farrell.
- Uncle Tommy.
- He's all yours.
- What about Kyle?
- Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.
We're letting them go. We don't
have a legal right to hold them.
Shawn!
- Remember me?
- Nikki?
- I'm Richard.
- Lily.
- Lily Bonham from St Louis?
- You knew my grandmother.
Some people have no place to go.
- What you looking at?
- I used to live here.
Heidi? Heidi, it's Mommy.
It's OK, sweetie.
- Brian.
- Lily.
There's no mistake.
You're definately pregnant.
- It's a restraining order.
- You can't stop me seeing her.
Who knows where all this is going?
We've got one case.
Maybe that's all.
You haven't noticed anything
unusual with Shawn?
I need to know if you had you'd tell me.
What looks good today, Carl?
I have a white fish with your name on it,
Mrs Martino.
When you were gone, in 18 months,
I haven't got a decent piece of fish.
You... you take care of me.
- You are such a sweetheart.
- Oh, it's easy being nice to you.
Tell me, how does it feel to be back?
It's OK. It's good.
Carl.
It's like I never left.
What do you think
you're doing out there?
I was helping a customer.
Rosie and Derek
can help a customer.
I said stock the display cases.
But I've known Mrs Martino
since I was a kid.
And I'm supposed to care?
Now, get that flounder on ice.
Grace.
- So how'd it go today?
- Slow as usual.
It's the neighbourhood.
It's not like it used to be.
- It's not that bad.
- It's gotten worse since you were away.
- I don't see it.
- You don't want to see it.
OK, I admit it.
It's not like when we were kids.
No one cares about the place any more.
There's no pride.
There's no sense of community.
I didn't know you were so unhappy.
I'm not unhappy. I got you back, didn't I?
I got nothing to complain about.
Yeah.
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Fish smell.
I don't mind.
I'll hop in the shower
when we get back.
- Let's cut across the park.
- Nobody goes into Bradley Park. No.
Yeah? Sure they do.
How do you think I got here?
It's not safe. There's nothing but
lowlifes and junkies in there.
Grace, 15 years ago
I proposed to you in this park.
15 years ago I was a size 2 and you had
your hair down to your shoulders.
Things change. From now on,
you take the long way around.
Grace, I just wish that you'd...
...stop worrying.
- Marry me, Gracie.
- Of course I will.
Yo, what are you doing
in our park, man?
Your park?
Just give up your wallet.
- You're mugging me?
- Now you're catching on.
- Seven bucks!
- It's all I have.
The complaints started after her foster
parents brought her back to quarantine.
What kind of complaints?
Well, for instance, yesterday
Maia spoke to a cafeteria employee.
She told her that her daughter would be
in the hospital soon, but would be OK.
Then the little girl was in a car accident.
So you're saying she's got
some kind of second sight?
I have five stories just like that one.
Why hold a little girl for 60 years
and then send her back
able to predict the future?
What were they thinking?
- We don't know if there is a they.
- He, she it, take your pick.
Let's leave that for the team
in the theory room.
We're not playing video games.
That's why they're intimidated.
They feel your hostility.
Good.
Don't worry too much
about the big brains.
Just talk to that girl.
Thanks.
I never meant to scare anyone.
We know that, sweetie.
But why did you say those things to
Mrs Krause about her daughter?
- Because they're true.
- But how did you know?
I just do.
If I asked you if it was going to rain next
Sunday, would you know the answer?
Maybe.
I don't know.
What's going to happen to me now?
The doctors here are going to take
another look at you.
Don't worry. It won't hurt.
I don't believe you.
It's gonna hurt, isn't it?
You might be uncomfortable some of the
time, but mostly it's going to be boring.
- Will you look in on me now and then?
- Me?
To see that I'm all right.
Sure.
- It's expensive.
- Rental vouchers will cover it.
So... do you have any questions?
The small bedroom, do you think it'll
get too much light for a nursery?
It's a northern exposure,
so you should be all right.
So what do you think?
- I like it.
- Me, too.
- Is this your first baby?
- Oh... we're not actually a couple.
Oh, so it's just you and the baby.
No, it'll be the three of us.
Why not? You can't stay in that hotel
forever. We can share this place.
Unless you don't want to.
No. No, I'd like that.
Great. I'll go do the paperwork.
- I hope I didn't embarrass you.
- No. It's...
It's not that. I figure he wouldn't rent
you the place if I was part of the deal.
I know, I know. It's not 1951 any more.
Times have changed, but...
Sometimes I'm just surprised
at how much.
Good. It's settled, then?
Oh, God.
Lily? Lily, what is it?
- Oh.
- Lily?
I don't feel so good.
You need to sit down.
Shall I call a doctor?
- No, no. No, let's just leave.
- And go where?
Anywhere but here.
Carl, where have you been?
- I got mugged.
- Oh, God. Are you all right?
- Did they hurt you?
- I didn't get hurt. They got hurt.
- Who did?
- I learned something important tonight.
I'm a different man. Those aliens, or
whoever took me, they did something.
They took me. They changed me.
They made me better.
First thing in the morning call
the counsellor and make an appointment.
I don't have time for that.
I've got things to do.
- What kind of things?
- The park, Gracie!
I want to make it like it was before.
People will bring their kids again.
You and me, we can have
our picnics at the old spot.
- Carl, you're scaring me.
- Wh...
There's nothing to be scared of,
not any more.
Linda, any idea why
Dr Mayhew wants to see us?
He didn't say.
So how have you been?
Good.
My lawyer was asking if you'd signed
those divorce papers yet.
I thought maybe if we had dinner
one night... we could sign them together.
You mean make plans
that you cancel at the last minute?
I'll bring the papers, we'll have a good
meal, a couple of glasses of wine...
And a good cry.
That, too.
Stefano's?
Yeah. Where else?
Tom, Linda, thanks for coming in.
I reviewed Kyle's EEG readout
and noticed something peculiar.
What now?
Last Thursday he had
a burst of brain activity.
It was brief, no more
than a few seconds.
That's good, isn't it?
Technically, yes.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I'll run tests,
see if I can find out what happened.
We've had three years of tests.
I understand your frustration,
but we need to look into this.
- It's a roller coaster, isn't it?
- Never ends.
Linda.
So Stefano's, right?
How does Thursday night sound, 7:30?
I'll be there.
- Dorothy.
- Yeah.
Did anyone visit last Thursday night,
besides his mother and me?
Let me check.
Yes. He had one other visitor.
Your nephew Shawn.
Shawn!
Yeah, I went and saw Kyle
on Thursday night.
He's my cousin. I wanted to see him.
- What about it?
- Nothing happened there?
I was only there for a couple of minutes.
So you saw nothing, did nothing?
What could I have done?
At your welcome home party, a bird
smacked into the window, remember?
It was stunned. What about it?
No, it was more than that.
And then... you picked it up.
Suddenly, it was alive and well.
What the hell did you do to Kyle?
Argh! I didn't do anything to him.
Look, I really like these chats we have,
Uncle Tommy, but I gotta go to class.
Shawn.
- We'll talk again.
- Oh, I can't wait.
We're going to see
Fountains Of Wayne this weekend.
Have fun.
You know,
this whole loner thing is so tired.
Well, it works for me.
Fountains of Wayne... Friday night!
What is with you?
Why do you keep pushing him?
Someone has to.
I don't see you doing anything.
I'm giving him his space, let him
figure things out for himself.
You should try it sometime.
Ugh!
Marco.
Skouris. Good. I checked out your idea.
- What idea?
- So am I a genius or am I crazy?
We don't make that distinction.
I visited a sampling of disappearance
sites on the west coast.
You were right.
The gravity there is weaker.
- But only by five parts per billion.
- That's barely measurable.
Not to mention barely understandable.
English, please.
The gravity changed at some places
people disappeared.
The question is, was it natural
or was it manipulated?
If it was manipulated,
the question is, by who?
So back to alien abductions?
I won't rule out little green men.
I need more measurements.
In other words,
you've made no progress.
Er... you explain it to him.
Oh, hold on!
You remember Adam Kensington?
The insurance guy Orson Bailey killed.
Yeah, what about him?
Not one of the good guys as it turns out.
He was in an insurance scheme
to defraud policy holders.
Bailey saved Washington state
a billion-dollar buy-out.
- Could have been Enron all over again.
- That's interesting.
Brings up all kinds of possibilities.
Well, er... don't be a stranger.
So are you saying whoever sent him
back meant him to go after Kensington?
It's a theory.
That's why they call it the theory room.
That's tight.
Oh, no. I suck.
Hey, is this about the concert thing?
No, no, it's got nothing to do with that.
I just want to know what's
going on with you and Nikki.
Me and Nikki what?
I just want to know what's going on
between you.
- What do you think's going on?
- Something.
She's always talking about you.
Can't go anywhere without
her wanting to bring you along.
- How's that my problem, Danny?
- Just do me a favour. Leave her alone.
I thought that's what I'd been doing.
Look, you got a problem with her,
go talk to her about it.
Yeah. We're the same age.
- I'm not your little brother now.
- Then stop acting like a two-year-old.
You're my brother. She's your girlfriend.
It's all good... right?
Yeah, right.
Richard, I am so glad I found this place.
Now we have a new apartment,
we can get you a computer.
Forget about the computer.
Let's get you to a doctor.
I'm fine.
I know this is going to sound strange,
but that other place we looked at,
the baby didn't like it.
Maternal instincts
kicking in already, huh?
No, it's not that. It's that somehow
I know what the baby's thinking.
Lily, the baby's barely two months along.
It's not thinking anything.
I can't explain it any more than you can
explain where you've been for 50 years,
or what's happened to us
during the time we've been gone.
I don't sound too strange, do I?
Of course not.
Lily?
I used to rock Heidi like that
when she was a baby.
- It feels like yesterday, but it wasn't.
- No.
It was what... 11 years ago?
I want to see Heidi. I miss her.
Lily, give it some time.
Once Brian's used to you being back,
he'll drop the restraining order.
Don't move!
Stop it! Cut it out! It isn't funny!
Shut up! Just shut up!
Hey, guys,
why don't you leave her alone?
- Get lost!
- No!
You get lost.
Go get him, man! Come on!
Hey, Maia.
How long have they left you like this?
A while. I think they all went
on their coffee break.
Oh! Well!
You know, that's pretty dumb
of them, isn't it?
- Will you stay until they come back?
- Of course.
When they show up, your doctors
and I are going to have a little talk.
- And then can I go home?
- Home?
With you. I don't like being here alone.
- You want to stay with me?
- You don't like being alone either.
I can always come back
for my checkups. Please.
Look, Maia, I'm not even sure I'm
the kind of person I want to live with.
No, I... eat cold pizza for breakfast and...
- That sounds all right to me.
- Yeah.
You know, Maia, just let me
think about it, OK?
- Where have you been?
- I was looking in on Maia.
- Really?
- I promised her, didn't I?
- So what have you got?
- Sid lent us his research clippings.
I think I found something
worth checking out.
One guy taking on three attackers
isn't far-fetched.
But if you saw him,
you'd think it was impossible.
He was... 35, 40, maybe five-foot-six,
weighed 150 pounds.
- So not exactly the Rock, huh?
- It was the way that he moved.
Could he have been on drugs,
maybe PCP?
He didn't act like he was on drugs.
You know, most guys
would have walked away.
Or, er... maybe called the cops later,
after it was too late.
But, er... this guy, he saved me.
I'm sorry.
Baldwin.
Linda.
Dinner. Yeah, no... Linda, I'm s...
Don't hang up, Linda. Just...
- Anything else you can remember?
- One thing.
This guy... I don't mean to be rude
or anything, but... he smelled funny.
Like day-old fish.
So that was your wife on the phone?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Fair enough.
So are we in Orson Bailey
territory here?
I wouldn't rule it out,
which would give us what?
A telekinetic insurance salesman,
a clairvoyant eight-year-old,
and now some kind of super vigilante.
- Hell of a trio.
- They're only the ones we know about.
Unless you can think of anyone else.
Just take it one case at a time.
Heidi, can you remember the formula
for an isosceles triangle?
Hey.
I'm probably not the best at this, but...
Oh!
- Richard?
- Lily. Thank God. Are you all right?
- I was worried sick. Where are you?
- I've been arrested.
Carl, I have my grandchildren
coming for dinner.
- How about some nice swordfish?
- You can't go wrong with swordfish.
- Carl!
- Give me a second, Burt. You got like...
What did I tell you about chatting
when work has to be done?
- Please stop with the finger.
- Stop?
I asked you not to do that.
Let go!
I mean it.
I show up on time. I do my work.
Now just leave me alone.
- OK?
- OK, OK.
So... how much swordfish
are we talking here?
There's a lot of chatter in DC about
putting the 4400 back in quarantine.
Not that I agree.
If they're dangerous, how is cramming
them into one space going to be safer?
...so I took my pistol
and I shot her in the forehead.
Shot who?
Do us a favour, Tom,
sign the divorce papers.
Do me a favour, Dennis, stay out of it.
- I spoke to her.
- What are you doing talking to Linda?
I danced with her at your wedding,
now I'm not supposed to talk to her?
- I was in the middle of an investigation.
- Tom.
You asked her for dinner
and you stood her up.
It slipped my mind.
Maybe.
Maybe you just don't want
to admit the truth to yourself.
- Brian Moore?
- Yeah.
- I'm Richard Tyler, a friend of Lily's.
- You another one of those 4400?
Is that a problem?
Look, I told her to stay away,
but she wouldn't listen.
I understand you're upset,
but Lily's in jail. You don't want that.
What I want is a normal life
for my daughter, for my family.
- It won't happen again.
- I'm supposed to take your word for it?
I promise, if you drop the charges, she'll
never bother you or Heidi ever again.
You used to love her once, remember?
Yeah, I remember.
- I want you to stop.
- I can't!
What do you mean, "can't"?
What you're doing is dangerous,
not to mention illegal.
You can't just go around
beating people up.
I've been given an opportunity
and I'm going to take it.
I'll clean up that park
and then I'll clean up the neighbourhood.
Oh, God, you sound like a crazy man.
You promised me
you'd call your counsellor.
- I never said that. You said it.
- Tomorrow, I'm going to call him.
You'd call Homeland Security on me?
The way you're acting,
can you blame me?
What I'm doing here,
I'm doing for us, Grace.
This is where we live. I just want us
to be happy and not be afraid any more
and it starts with Bradley Park!
- I don't want it to end there.
- It won't. I won't let it.
They can't hurt me. No one can.
You're just one man.
I lost you once
and I don't want to lose you again.
I can do it.
I can make
this neighbourhood safe again.
For you, for Mrs Martino... even Burt.
So please stop worrying.
This is what I was meant to do.
This is my destiny.
This was brand new when I disappeared.
And it's a... What do you call it?
Golden oldie.
I guess I'm a golden oldie, too.
No, not to me.
Hey, we have to talk about
what happened last night.
No, there's nothing to talk about.
Do you know what I saw when I looked
through Brian's window?
A happy family.
I realised Heidi doesn't need me.
- Maybe one day...
- I'll be there for her if she does.
But until then I'll stay away.
This is where I want to be now,
here with you.
Where I'm happy. And the baby's happy.
Well, that makes three happy people.
All you've done for me...
...it's not because I remind you
of the other Lily, is it?
Maybe at first.
Now all I see is you.
- Danny's inside.
- I'm not here to see Danny.
Cute. Can you turn it back on, please?
Did Danny say something to you?
Is that why you're acting like his? Our
friendship has nothing to do with him.
Nikki, we don't have a friendship, OK?
Shawn, listen to me...
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Hey, hey, come here. Let me see it.
Let me see.
It's gone.
It doesn't hurt any more.
It must not have been that bad of a burn.
Yes, it was.
You did something to it, didn't you?
Tom. See, the thing about vigilantes
is that they're not very common,
except in Charles Bronson movies,
so I have to create my own profile.
Now, we know he's a white male,
slender, somewhere between 30 and 50.
He works a blue-collar job,
has low self-esteem,
lives in a high-crime area.
I'm with you so far.
I cross-checked my profile
with the members of the 4400
in and around the Seattle area
and I came up with 37 names.
You're not taking me through all 37.
Of those 37, I was able to eliminate 24.
I'm sure you don't care how.
- And that left me with 13.
- I'm on the edge of my seat.
Here are my two favourites -
Robert Lorenzano and Carl Morrissey.
They both fit the profile,
but Carl, he's our guy.
Check out his occupation.
- Supermarket employee.
- Yeah, I called the store.
Carl works in the seafood section.
- And our guy smelled like day-old fish.
- Oh, yeah. I'm good.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
I just cleaned that!
Come on!
We'd like to talk to your husband.
Why?
- Any idea where he was Tuesday night?
- He was here.
- You sure about that?
- I just told you.
Have you heard of
the "Bradley Park vigilante"?
What does that have to do with Carl?
You tell us, Mrs Morrissey.
You're not going to throw him
back into quarantine, are you?
- We want to help him.
- That's funny.
That's all Carl wants to do is help.
People grumble
but nobody does anything,
nobody tries to make anything better,
except Carl.
Where is he, Mrs Morrissey?
- Carl.
- Grace.
I got rid of all the graffiti.
Oh, my God, Carl.
You should have seen it.
They were falling like bowling pins.
I didn't see the knife.
I don't know why I didn't see the knife.
- This is Agent Baldwin...
- Get an ambulance!
Get an ambulance to
Bradley Park right away.
I thought I could clean the whole
neighbourhood up myself.
I thought that's why they sent me back,
but I guess I was wrong.
No, no, no, no!
No, don't leave me, Carl. Please.
No! No!
I just want you. I just... want you.
No.
Why give him extra juice to think he can
make a difference, send him back...
Only to get himself killed.
- What's the point?
- I wish to hell I knew.
The wife of slain
Bradley Park vigilante, Carl Morrissey,
revealed that her husband
was one of the controversial 4400.
Mrs Morrissey stated that her husband
was a true neighbourhood hero,
a sentiment echoed
by many area residents.
Law enforcement officials
and a spokesperson
for the National Threat
Assessment Command
refused to confirm or deny
Mrs Morrissey's statement.
That paperwork.
OK. I need you to sign there.
And there.
And initial here.
- And sign there.
- That's it?
You got Mr Ryland to sign the approvals,
that simplifies things.
- I thought you were one of the doctors.
- Yeah. I thought you were asleep.
So you sure fooled me.
- How would you like to get out of here?
- Now?
Right now.
Look out, look out, look out!
- Where's Kyle?
- Surgery.
Dr Mayhew said he's got some kind
of fluid building up in his skull.
They're trying to relieve the pressure.
What do you mean "trying"?
They said that draining the fluid
might not be enough.
That more might build up and if it does,
then Kyle could suffer permanent
brain damage within a week.
Uncle Tommy, Mom's on the way.
Previously on "The 4400".
- Listen up, we're DefCon 1.
- A comet cannot change course.
- This one has.
- Then it's not a comet.
We're not sure what's happened.
Thousands of people have appeared.
A telekinetic salesman,
a clairvoyant eight-year-old
and some kind of super-vigilante.
They can't hurt me, no one can.
Those are only the ones we know about.
Unless you can think of anyone else?
There's nothing to tell.
What's going on between you two?
You're my brother.
She's your girlfriend.
It's all good.
Oh... We're not actually a couple.
- So, it's just you and the baby?
- No. It'll be the three of us.
- What did you do to Kyle?
- I didn't do anything to him.
Then can I go home? With you?
I don't like being here alone.
You don't like being alone either.
They said draining the fluid might
not be enough, more might build up.
If it does, Kyle could suffer
permanent brain damage.
The time I lost is gone.
I'll never get it back,
but my years in the dark
didn't kill me.
And my work remains.
And even though I might not
understand what's happening to me,
I have faith in the final outcome.
After all, I'm doing
what I was intended to do,
becoming what I was meant to be.
I look forward to
corresponding with you again,
I know it's been a long time.
I tell you this as a courtesy -
you can observe my work,
but there's no point
in trying to interfere with it.
I'm now in full command of my talents.
I hope the world is ready.
Despite protests, Homeland Security
refuses to divulge the names
or whereabouts of the 4400
living here in the US.
Confirmed reports of unusual abilities
have the public panicked.
And yet this man sitting beside me
says we have nothing to worry about.
I'm sure most of you recognise him
even though he's been away
for the past 28 months.
I'm talking about Mr Jordan Collier,
who recently breached
the government's wall of silence
and chose to out himself
as one of the notorious 4400.
Jordan...
Why? Why now? Why here?
- What's your agenda?
- I have no agenda.
But someone had to put
a human face on the 4400.
We've been demonised enough
by people like you.
If you're implying this is a witch-hunt,
I disagree.
You're not the one burnt at the stake.
- Breakfast is ready.
- Shouldn't I be saying that to you?
Maia!
Thank you very much!
This beats a can of coke
and a slice of cold pizza.
- I'll get better at being the grown-up.
- It's OK.
I like being the grown-up.
I think you'll have a good time
with Mrs Benke.
I hear she's a very cool babysitter.
I talked to Mr Ryland about permission
to get you enrolled in school.
- That would be nice, right?
- Yeah, school might be fun.
Diana...
You're not going to like what's in there.
Oliver Knox disappeared
August 22nd 1983,
five nights after the last body turned up.
- He moved back when?
- Three weeks ago.
- Nineteen days before the latest body.
- It could be a coincidence.
The letter seems genuine but
the latest victim wasn't a prostitute.
- The others were.
- Coincidence.
That's the kind of positive thinking
we like to encourage.
If it is Knox, we've got
a 4400 serial killer on our hands.
If that's not a worst-case scenario,
it'll do for one.
It's the kind of issue
Barbara Yates lives for.
- So we're off to Friday Harbor.
- Bring me back a t-shirt. Alex...
National Threat
Assessment Command, NTAC.
- You're here about Knox?
- Got it.
It's a small town.
Oliver reappeared after 21 years
and he doesn't look a day older.
We connected the dots.
Are you gonna take over
my investigation?
We'll be co-operating until we
establish Knox's guilt or innocence.
I could use some fresh air.
And some co-operation.
His alibi's airtight.
We still want to talk to him.
Anything else you can tell us?
You want to know about Knox?
When he was 15,
he was bow hunting with his cousin.
There was an accident, Knox
ended up with an arrow in his chest.
His cousin panicked and ran.
Knox woke up in a pool of blood,
with an arrow in his chest.
So he pulled it out
and cauterised the wound?
Even better. He stood up
and walked four miles into town,
strolled into the emergency room
and checked himself in.
All this with an arrow in his chest.
Years later, I asked him
if it happened that way.
He said every word was true.
I told him, "That must have been
the walk from hell."
"Not at all", he said. "It was exhilarating."
He felt like he could
have walked forever.
That's Oliver Knox.
Mr Knox... Mr Knox.
We've a few questions
about the death of Theresa Baron.
Sheriff Conrad call you or you
jumped to the same conclusion?
Not a big jump. You were
on the police radar back in '83.
Along with a number of other people.
Did you know Ms Baron?
No. She was born after I was abducted.
Look, I know how tempting
the math is on this murder.
I disappear in '83, the killings stop.
- Here I am, and the poor girl's dead.
- We noticed.
In your shoes,
I'd probably want me to be guilty too.
It would be so convenient, but...
I almost feel bad I can't oblige you.
I did not kill that woman.
Listen, can I get you some water?
If we're going to talk
we might as well be civilised.
No. We've taken up
enough of your time.
Conrad told me about
how you got shot in the chest that day.
Jim does love to talk.
You'd like to see the arrow?
I have it inside.
That won't be necessary.
How's Kyle?
We don't know yet.
About last night...
- The kiss.
- That.
And other things.
- We have a lot to talk about.
- No, we don't.
Shawn.
You have a gift.
- Nikki. When did you get here?
- How's Kyle?
Still in intensive care
but Uncle Tommy says he's stable.
Guess whatever they've been
doing to him worked.
For now, anyway.
Listen, I'm starving. You wanna
come with us to the cafeteria?
Yeah. I'll bring you a burrito.
Start with something easy.
- Tell me about your parents.
- My parents?
They used to argue about money a lot.
That was before they split up.
- They divorced?
- Yeah, I was 14.
Do you remember
how that made you feel?
Depressed.
Angry, maybe.
Why don't you tell me
about the rest of your family?
They're gone.
Got a few cousins outside of St Louis
who remember me as a...
picture in an old photo album.
My husband married another woman.
My brother hates that I'm back.
What's the point of this?
Look, you wanna help me?
Help me find a job.
Tell me what to say
when they ask me how old I am.
Or about my work experience or
how to explain that gap in my resume.
Everyone says the world's better,
people don't judge you by your skin.
I'm still being judged. You're asking me
about my relationship with my parents?
Let's talk about this hostility
that you're manifesting towards me.
Danny, you wanted to see me?
Thanks, Peter.
- So this is where you work?
- Yeah.
- What's up?
- I want to talk to you about something.
- Is it about Shawn?
- How did you know?
I'm listening.
He had a fight
at school a few weeks ago.
He might've killed the guy
but I stepped in.
What did he do to him?
It sounds crazy but...
It was like Shawn was draining
the life out of him, somehow.
I'm not the only one who saw it.
What made you decide to tell me now?
Just thought you should know.
Beautiful, aren't they?
I wonder if that's where we were.
- What's everybody doing here?
- What are you doing here?
I don't know. I wanted to see it,
where we came back.
I figured it would be a good place
to come and think, to clear my head.
Most people come for the conversation.
- There's not a lot of that going on.
- Give it time.
Around 11 o'clock, this place becomes
one big group therapy session.
I'm sorry to interrupt
but I just had to see this myself.
My name's Jordan Collier.
Some of you may recognise me.
If you do, you know I'm one of the 4400,
just like you.
I'm impressed that
you've found each other.
And I'm glad that you've come
in support of each other.
And...
I'm cold!
And I have to guess
that you guys are cold too.
I suggest that we continue
these get-togethers indoors.
I have a place nearby.
It's warm, it's spacious.
I want to invite all of you to meet me
there next Thursday afternoon.
You listen to the news,
you read the paper, you hear the talk.
It seems like the entire world
is turning against us.
Well, what are we going to do about it?
Are we gonna give up?
Run and hide? Maybe.
Or maybe, just maybe,
we build a world of our own.
This is the spot where
we found Theresa Baron's body.
- We went over everything pretty good.
- Yeah, well...
We have the toys.
We like to take them out of the box.
The killer posed her
after she was dead?
There should have been
blood hand-prints all over.
It rained that day.
The scene was washed clean.
But if he dragged her over here,
he had to grab onto something.
Tom.
I'll be damned.
His name is Philip Lopez.
He did 18 years for rape.
He was paroled six months ago.
His prints were found at the scene
of Theresa Baron's murder.
Everyone set?
Go.
Lopez!
Tom.
The suicide note says
he killed all nine women.
Only his time away
kept him from doing more.
The dates makes sense?
Lopez worked as seasonal
labour during the first round of killings.
I guess we owe Oliver Knox an apology.
Excuse me, can I get
a cranberry juice and Seltzer?
And... give me another
of what he's having.
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, I...
I go to Florence in four days
and I didn't want to seem like a tourist.
- Ice?
- A little.
- I studied Italian in college.
- Really?
"Beautiful as a sunset over Duomo."
- That is very good. You get an A Plus.
- And you get a free round.
- Felicia. Can I get a beer?
- Grazie.
Need a refill, friend?
- Thanks.
- Listen, I...
We don't know each other
but I've something to show you.
- So, what's her name?
- I don't know.
But... I can tell you something about her.
Hello?
So sorry I'm late!
Hey, Iris, how did we do today?
- I can't come back here.
- What? Why?
That child. I'm sorry.
You'll find someone.
I told her we wouldn't be seeing
each other for a couple of weeks.
Why did you tell her that?
Because she was
gonna be called for jury duty.
She thought I was kidding.
A few hours later, her husband called.
And she got a summons for jury duty?
Well, hey, come here.
It's OK, all right? It's OK.
- What are you doing here so late?
- My mom said he was getting worse.
The fluid's building inside his skull again.
Why did they take me
and leave him like this?
We were both on the beach that night,
I don't understand.
I wish I could remember something
'cause I keep thinking,
I think it would help.
Tom said you were here
the night Kyle had that...
jump in his brain activity.
He was getting better.
And now he's dying.
Shawn, did you do something to him?
Shawn, tell me. Just talk to me.
You know I didn't do anything.
I told Uncle Tommy. I told you, OK?
I gotta go.
I wish we could talk to a doctor.
And say what?
"My baby may be an alien and,
by the way, I know what it's thinking"?
That will just get me thrown
right back in to quarantine.
I was there today
to register our address.
Thanks,
I can't stand going back there.
I ran into Gary Branscombe.
He had the bed next to mine. He told me
about Jordan Collier's get-togethers.
- He's the hotel guy?
- Yeah, turns out he's one of us.
We should go.
Richard, come on! You can't tell me
teenagers didn't make out in 1951.
- Yeah, in a parked car by the lake.
- Oh, in a parked car by the lake?
That's very cute.
Let me tell you somethin' about her...
Let me tell you somethin'...
I can tell you somethin'...
Let me tell you somethin'...
Let me tell you somethin'...
Are you crazy?
Get outta the road!
I killed them. I killed them all.
- I killed them all.
- Hands up! Keep your hands up!
Gail Keating.
She worked at a video store.
They found her body
in the park this morning.
Her blood was all over him.
He spoke for five minutes
when we brought him in.
Confessed to Gail's death
and the other nine murders.
- Not a word since.
- Lopez killed Theresa Baron.
He said so in his suicide note,
her shirt was in his apartment...
This morning, Charlie Staley
confessed to the same murder.
They both claim to be
behind the original killings?
Yeah. Only Charlie's 39. He was five
years old when the first death happened.
We can eliminate Lopez
as a suspect as well.
- How d'you figure that?
- Lopez's prison records.
He was left-handed.
The autopsy reports show
the Friday Harbor killer
was right-handed.
So Lopez kills one girl,
Staley kills the other,
and neither one
committed the original crimes.
Why would they confess to murders
they couldn't possibly have committed?
- The pieces don't quite fit together.
- Until you add Knox into the puzzle.
He disappears, the killings stop.
He came back, they started again.
Let's say Knox is involved somehow.
That means what? He's forcing
these men to do his murders for him?
Could be. The question is, how?
Why have more than one person
admit the crimes?
One, we'd stop digging.
Two gets our attention.
Maybe he can't control everything.
What if Knox can force people to kill?
But only by convincing them
they really are the Friday Harbor killers?
In for one murder, in for them all.
Good!
Hi, welcome.
1969, huh? The good news is,
your bell-bottoms are back in style.
- Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.
There's this guy I was just
talking to, he was gone for 40 years.
He picked everything up
without missing a beat.
Then there's me,
I'm gone for three years.
- And it's like my life's fallen apart...
- I know, Shawn.
Remember that most of us
feel the same way you do.
Some of us are more different
than others, if you know what I mean.
I'm not sure I do.
OK. I had this fight with a guy at school,
I know it's gonna sound crazy...
I really can't hear the specifics right now.
Not yet, anyway. I've a lot of interviews
over the next few weeks.
I have to be able to deny what I need to.
I know you're feeling confused,
and I can't blame you.
But it sounds to me
like you've been given a gift.
That's what Nikki called it.
Well, Nikki's right, whoever she is.
And this gift, don't let it scare you.
- You will find the right way to use it.
- OK.
What can I do for you this afternoon,
Lily '93?
Don't worry, it's not a line.
Though you're the most attractive
abductee I've met all afternoon.
- Jordan Collier. I'm throwing this party.
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Do I detect a little romance
brewing among the 4400?
You have a good eye.
I'm happy you're getting
something positive out of all this.
- You're Jordan Collier.
- Yes. See? He's not afraid of me.
I'm a little light-headed. It's hot.
I should sit down.
- Why don't I find you a seat?
- I'll get some water.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do you want me to call a doctor?
No, I'm not sick. It'll pass.
- Here you go.
- That's good.
- If you're not sick, then what's...?
- It's just morning sickness.
- You're pregnant.
- First trimester.
Well, that explains it.
Congratulations to both of you.
Did I say something wrong?
- It's a little more complicated...
- Richard's not the father.
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted
but I was when I got back.
Strange, huh?
Interesting, is more like it.
It makes you wonder
what they had in mind.
Whoever took us, I mean.
You haven't told your counsellor
about this, have you?
- We haven't told anyone.
- I'd keep it that way for now.
Look, how are you guys managing?
Have everything you need?
Everything except a job.
I was a pilot in the air force,
supposed to be drawing a pension.
That hasn't come through yet.
I've applied for flight instructor jobs,
even for Seattle PD.
Every time they find out
I'm one of the 4400,
the job suddenly goes away.
Look. I may have something
you'd be interested in.
It doesn't involve flying but given
your background in the military...
My foundation has an opening
in the security department.
- Foundation?
- For the 4400.
If you're interested,
come by tomorrow and see me.
- I'll be there.
- Good.
The rash of violence
involving the 4400 continues.
Sources tell us Homeland Security is
investigating a possible connection
between the Friday Harbor murders
and an undisclosed returnee.
That hypocritical, self-righteous,
irresponsible bitch...
- I take it he doesn't like her show.
- He doesn't like her.
When we were with the FBI,
she disclosed the name of a juror.
Judge declared a mistrial,
three years of work down the drain.
She blindsided me once.
That is not going to happen again.
Tom Baldwin.
Yes, Sheriff.
I see.
We'll be there. That was Conrad.
He got another letter.
"I decide who lives and who dies.
"My judgement is final
and more verdicts are coming."
The date's clipped
from this morning's paper.
Couldn't have been composed
by Charlie Staley. Not from jail.
This letter's
from the Friday Harbor killer?
It's genuine. It describes
wound patterns on the original victims.
We kept that private.
If you believe Knox is involved,
why's he out there walking around?
- Let's pick him up, right now.
- We can't.
We need to know exactly how he's
linked to these murders to bring him in.
So what do we do?
Wait for another girl to turn up dead?
We can do better than that.
- $27.75, your change.
- Thank you.
- What's this?
- Let me tell you something about her.
Her name's Felicia.
She works over at the bar...
I expected a scolding on the phone.
Maybe a tax audit. Not an invitation
into the belly of the beast.
Consider it a tribute to your bully pulpit.
- I'm flattered.
- Don't be.
DC is calling for your head.
I want you to dial back on the 4400.
Not gonna happen. I'm a journalist,
I answer to my viewers.
Don't hide behind freedom of the press.
You shout "Fire!" in a crowded theatre.
And you're gonna stop
before the stampede begins.
Yeah, you have a really strong face.
Seriously, you should come on my show.
You're getting in the way of my job.
If you continue to interfere with
Homeland Security, tread lightly.
And what are you gonna do?
Disappear me?
- I asked for your cooperation.
- I've chosen not to give it.
Fair enough. Don't forget to get
your parking validated on the way out.
This healthcare plan is incredible.
The cover should provide
for all your doctor's visits
and hospital care once the baby's born.
- Mr Collier, I don't know what to say.
- Say you'll take the job?
I'm sorry, I have to take this...
Len?
Good, good.
The whole property?
Excellent. 26 million.
Yes, I want you to close.
Don't worry about the board of directors.
They voted me back in as CEO
when I returned. I'll handle them.
Call me when it's done. OK.
Real estate deals.
They're never over till they're over.
So, are you going to come
to work for me or not?
I can start tomorrow.
Mr Ryland, Phil Gibson.
This is an honour.
Barbara will be very disappointed
not to be here.
- Actually, I prefer to speak to you.
- Great.
First, just let me say, sir,
any information you give us
about the 4400
will never be traced back to you.
Glad to hear that.
I've something important to pass on.
- Mind if I tape this?
- Quick and simple.
I want Barbara Yates's
coverage of the 4400 to stop.
- What do you mean?
- I mean it ends.
She stops covering the story, period.
Listen, Mr Ryland, Barbara has sole
authority over her editorial content.
Barbara says what Barbara wants.
There's nothing I can do about it.
You're her producer. Produce.
You don't know what it's like
in this business these days.
- We're not Walter Cronkite.
- You want to talk about the old days?
In the old days, I would need
a warrant to tap all your phones,
to freeze all your assets,
and to prevent you from ever being
a passenger on any airline in the world.
Like you say,
it's not the old days any more.
You've worked for Barbara Yates
since the beginning.
I'm guessing you know
where the bodies are buried.
Draw me a map.
My Dad will kick your ass
if I come home smelling of beer.
Evil cousin Shawn,
corruptor of the innocent.
Help! Help me, Shawn!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me.
I lost my dog.
Can you help me find him?
- I haven't seen him.
- A wire-haired terrier named Boss.
I haven't seen him.
Would you let me by?
This isn't funny.
- I'll scream.
- Yes, you will.
Don't move!
Felicia has to die! She has to!
This man. What did he say to you,
Mr Mitchell?
- You've been following me?
- No. Actually, we were following Knox.
I really like the composition of this shot,
its nice, cosy symmetry.
Now, what did he say to you?
You keep at him. We'll bring in Knox,
sit him next to his friend.
See what they
have to say to each other.
- Knox! Open up!
- Tom!
Knox!
- Are the police at the girl's house?
- She refused an escort.
Hello.
Hello?
Excuse me. I lost my dog.
Can you help me find him?
A wire-haired terrier named Boss.
Somebody help me!
Let her go, Knox!
Knox! Get away from her or I'll shoot.
- I think you broke my nose.
- Stay down!
- You got me wrong. Let me tell you...
- Not a word, not a word.
Goddamn serial killer. This guy murders
eight people before he's abducted.
They send him back,
he picks up where he left off.
In '83, Knox was
your garden variety psychopath.
They sent him back enhanced.
Big difference.
It makes whoever took him
sound pretty nasty.
They also sent back Shawn. And Maia.
I know. For that, I'd like to thank them.
But it all seems so random.
Maybe. Until you start
to look at the bigger picture.
Orson Bailey kills Adam Kensington.
Revenge murder. Open and shut.
Carl Morrissey's a well-intentioned
vigilante who ends up dead.
Random.
But we know Kensington's company
was perpetrating a massive fraud.
We've learned that
since Morrissey's death,
his neighbours formed
a committee protecting the park.
Anyone starting to see a pattern?
What? You're talking about
some kind of ripple effect?
Diana to the head of the class.
The incidents themselves
are just catalysts for change.
- Positive change in these two cases.
- Wait a minute.
Whoever sent them back planned
for these changes to take place?
Nothing positive in the Knox killing.
Or maybe we haven't
seen the ripples yet.
Excuse me.
Hey... I have something I wanna tell you.
Hey...
I have something I wanna tell you!
Police won't say who released
this closely-guarded secret.
A document containing the names
and addresses
of all the 4400
has appeared on the internet
and is now posted
on more than 20 sites.
Authorities won't confirm the leak
but efforts to shut down the sites,
with an emergency injunction,
suggest the list is genuine.
We'll have more on this breaking story
as it develops.
What are you doing here, Shawn?
Kyle?
How long...
...have I been in the dark?
Previously on 'The 4400'.
We're not sure what's
happened. There's something out there.
The light has gone and
thousands of people have appeared.
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
You will be one of the teams
investigating what happened
to the returnees.
- We're letting them go.
- Letting them go?
We don't have a right to hold them.
Why disappear a little girl,
hold her for 60 years
and send her back,
able to predict the future?
- What were they thinking?
- Is there a 'they'?
Whoever sent them planned
for these changes to take place.
You're talking about a ripple effect?
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.
You haven't told your counsellor,
have you?
My foundation has an opening
in the security department.
- If you're interested, come and see me.
- I'll be there.
Despite nationwide
protests, Homeland Security refuses
to divulge the names or whereabouts
of the 4400 living in the United States.
You don't do journalism,
You're getting in the way.
What are you going to do?
Disappear me?
- About last night...
- The kiss.
And other things.
We've got a lot to talk about.
I was reviewing Kyle's EEG
read-out and it seems last Thursday
he had a momentary burst
of increased brain activity.
Shawn, did you do something
to him? Talk to me.
- How long have I been in the dark?
- Kyle?
The results are inconclusive
but we must be missing something.
People don't regain consciousness
after a three year coma for no reason.
We don't care why this happened.
Right, Tom?
We're just glad to have Kyle back.
You've been prodding him for a week.
When can we take him home?
- I don't see why not now.
- That's wonderful.
But there is something else.
Patients like Kyle often have difficulty
adjusting to their awakenings.
They do best in environments similar to
those they were in before their comas.
In every detail. Places, the people...
All right, come on.
- Why are we here?
- We thought you'd be happier at home.
- Then, why take me here?
- Kyle, this is your home.
This is your room, Kyle.
It's just the way you left it.
OK.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got you.
I got you.
This isn't my room.
And this isn't my house.
- Kyle.
- Kyle.
What are looking for, buddy?
What are you looking for?
- We can help.
- Kyle, Kyle, talk to us.
- What is he doing?
- I say we just let him work it out.
But he hasn't recognised his room.
Linda, the doctor told us
he'd be disoriented.
I'm glad you're moving back in.
I'll try to stay out of your way
as much as I can.
Come on, Jordan,
aren't you overreacting?
No, I'm not at all.
Publishing the names and addresses
of the 4400 is a crime, Barbara.
It's a violation of the privacy
of over 4,000 people.
Whoever did it should be prosecuted.
So, warning people
they may be living next to
a public menace is a crime...
- We don't want any.
- Shawn, it's your uncle.
Let me in.
- Uncle Tommy.
- Hey, Shawn.
- Come to take the tour?
- Quite a procession out there.
Yep. They started driving by the house
the day my name showed up on the Net.
They haven't stopped since.
Yey for us!
Well, I know this is hard for you, Shawn.
I just stopped by to say thank you.
We took Kyle home yesterday
and... I'm grateful.
- He's doing good, right?
- Yeah. He's got a lot of work to do but...
...he's awake.
Aunt Linda, does she know?
- About what I did, I mean?
- No, I figured you wouldn't want that.
Truth is, Uncle Tommy...
I don't know what happened.
I put my hands on him. That's it.
He woke up.
- He woke up and I don't know why.
- You see, Shawn.
This thing that you can do.
Whatever it is, we need to learn more.
Well how? How?
I could go into quarantine again.
They could study me some more.
No! I'm done with all that.
With the hypnosis and the dream
journals and the counselling.
I hear you. But I can be an ally.
Maybe I can help you.
I don't think so, Uncle Tommy.
That was some movie.
Biggest screen I ever saw.
And the sound and all those, er...
- Special effects.
- Yes.
- So, did you like it?
- Not really. But it sure did look good.
- Something's wrong.
- Down!
- The genie is out of the bottle.
- Three different bombings in one day.
Each targeting the 4400s
whose addresses were made public.
Wait a second.
- It's a pipe bomb, tripwire trigger.
- It's about as basic as you can get.
Amateur.
Diana, I just found part of the casing.
Mm-hm.
It's beautiful.
Shawn's name is on that list.
I had my sister upgrade
her security system, but...
Yeah, I'm worried about Maia, too.
Did you ever think about
putting her back into quarantine?
Yeah, I've thought about it.
I've even talked it over with her.
She started crying.
She wants to stay with me, Tom.
I'm glad it's working out.
Who would have thought?
How's Kyle adjusting
to being back home?
Still weak, his memory's a mess
but he's out of that damn hospital.
What does his doctor think?
He's stunned, just like us.
It's a miracle. I don't have
any other way of putting it.
What about Shawn?
What about him?
Where was he when Kyle woke up?
I have no idea.
All three bombs so far were
identical in design and composition.
Pipe casings, tripwire triggers.
I did a chemical analysis
of the explosive.
It's homemade plastique,
boiled down from bleach.
The recipe's on the internet.
Just like the list of victims.
I'd like to get my hands on
whoever leaked those names.
Come on, Tom.
Who do you think leaked them?
- Barbara Yates.
- Goddamn right. It's just her style.
Cheap, inflammatory
and dangerously irresponsible.
I'll handle Yates.
You two back-trace hits on websites
that published these bomb recipes.
- We'll have the results soon.
- So will I.
- You own this entire complex?
- 80 homes.
Once we have this place off the ground,
I'm planning developments in Chicago
and Los Angeles.
I intend to provide a safe haven for
any 4400 in this country who needs one.
We're opening sooner than I planned
but the bombings make that necessary.
You do think big, don't you?
I'm a business man.
I've been given a second chance
to do something with my life,
besides make money.
Cos right now, that's just not enough.
Or maybe I'm having a mid-life crisis.
93 Tomberra Lane,
what do you think?
Oh, they're beautiful.
They're all beautiful.
Well, it's yours.
You'll be our first official residents.
Oh, we can't afford a house right now.
Consider it a gift
for the two of you and your new baby.
It's a small world.
You did it, didn't you?
Kyle waking up?
That was you.
You fixed him,
just like you fixed my hand.
- Have you told Danny?
- No, and I don't want you to.
But maybe if he knew
what you did,
he'd stop thinking of you as...
A monster.
I've been doing some thinking.
This thing between Danny and me.
- Maybe it was a mistake.
- I don't want to hear this.
It's not your fault.
I mean that.
Danny's sweet.
I like him, but...
...that's all.
He more than likes you.
I know.
- Dennis Ryland?
- Yeah.
I'm Warren Lyttel. I believe HomeSec
in D.C. Mentioned I was coming.
Oh yeah, they warned me.
Well, they're never happy.
They seem to think you need to be more
aggressive investigating the 4400.
I'm here to nudge things along.
"Authority to review all 4400 case files.
"Access to all meetings
and briefing sessions.
"Permission to ride with field agents
at your discretion."
- That's a pretty broad mandate.
- They're looking at five murders.
Three unsolved bombings.
Barbara Yates
bashing us all over the airwaves.
Seems to them you could use help.
I suppose it could look that way
from a conference room in D.C.
It looks that way from everywhere
except this glass tower of yours.
I have 1,000 returnees
within 75 miles of Seattle.
I've got two dozen agents
to ride herd on all of them.
You wanna help me?
Get me some more personnel.
You wanna help me?
Get D.C. Off my back.
But you're not really here to help me,
are you?
No.
- We're here to clean up your mess.
- Where did they recruit you from?
- FBI? NSA?
- Doesn't matter where I came from.
How long have you been
in public service? 15, 16 years?
And suddenly you got a shot
at a command of your own.
Well, you come and take it from me.
If you can.
Kyle, what's going on?
- They're lies.
- What do you mean?
These pictures, I don't belong in them.
These people, I don't know them.
No, no, no. Of course, you do.
Look. This is you at the zoo with
Grandma Fran when you were eight.
Remember?
And this is your birthday party
when you turned ten.
You remember George?
- He was my friend.
- That's right. That's right.
And Freddy,
you have to remember Freddy.
He was over here all the time
when you were little. Remember?
- Bugs Bunny.
- That's right.
- Exactly. He was crazy about cartoons.
- Don't touch me!
I'm sorry. I'm, I'm... trying to help.
It's not my memory.
You're my father. I recognise you,
but I don't know who you are.
It's like you're a stranger.
Kyle, Kyle.
Kyle, just look at me.
Just look at me.
- I need help.
- I want to help you.
- Why can't you help me?
- I'm trying.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
The ripple effect. What about it?
Every time we stop by the theory room,
you and Marco always talk about
how every case we work on
has a ripple effect.
Every case but
the Friday Harbor murders.
What if these bombings
are that ripple?
Knox went from killing prostitutes
before his disappearance
to killing random women
once he came back.
- What if they weren't random?
- That's interesting.
We should look into Knox's victims.
See if we can find a connection there.
I can't condone these bombings,
but I understand the fear behind them.
The easiest way to stop the violence
is to put the 4400 out of harm's way.
Someplace safe for them and for us.
Now, I know to some of you that
that may sound harsh, heartless even.
And I assure you, I don't mean it to be.
Just as I assure you that
there are those among the 4400 who...
Truck's ready to go.
I won't be happy till we torch them all.
They can all burn in hell.
- Hey, I was listening to that.
- I'm sick of listening to it.
- She's on our side.
- That woman is a parasite.
She doesn't give a damn about us
or that our sister was murdered
by one of those 4400 bastards. OK?
Why don't you unload the fertiliser, eh?
Leave the air filter on.
Those damn fumes are killing me.
Kyle! Kyle!
Hey!
Hey!
It's good to see you, man.
What are you doing
sitting out here in the rain?
What are you staring at?
Listen, you're looking pretty good.
The way your folks were talking
I thought you'd be some kind of zombie.
They won't leave me alone.
Asking me questions,
staring at me all the time.
They're just glad to have you back.
My mom did the same thing to me.
My parents had you come here, didn't
they? To try to make me remember.
- No, Kyle. Hey!
- I'm going inside.
- I've got reading to do.
- You've got reading to do!
Kyle!
Come on! I just got here.
Look at you!
I could have bought a car in my day
for the price of this suit.
- How's it going?
- We've got a lot of work to do.
Five families moved in today.
Seven more by the end of the week.
Got half a mile of property line
to shore up. The fences are too short.
- Overhanging trees along the perimeter.
- Along the perimeter?
Well, as long as you're on the job,
I feel safe and so does the baby.
Two happy residents.
That's a start.
It has been a crazy day.
No, my assistant's out.
My phone sheet is a mile long.
I never got to the end of it. Anyway...
Miss Yates, Dennis Ryland
would like to speak with you.
Dennis.
What a pleasant surprise!
Well, this is a bit theatrical,
don't you think?
- Read this.
- What is it?
- It's a story. A good one.
- About the 4400?
No, about a TV talking head that was
involved in a car accident last year.
A hit and run, actually.
It was really ugly.
The pedestrian she hit died instantly.
It was a shame.
He was 40 years old, father of three.
No wonder she spent
so much money covering it up.
So...
Are you blackmailing me, Dennis?
I shut up about the 4400 and this
envelope goes in a vault somewhere?
Not good enough, Barbara.
- What do you want me to do?
- It's too late for you to do anything.
I gave you a chance and you refused.
Steve Smizick from
the D.A.'s office wants to talk to you.
He's going to charge you
with vehicular manslaughter,
among other things.
Look, face it.
Shutting me up is not going to make
the 4400 disappear from the headlines.
And eventually,
they will cost you your job.
We'll see.
Goodbye, Barbara.
Is this wisest move under
the circumstances, Mr Collier?
All these 4400s in the same place
is a target.
There are always dangers.
That's why I hired the security team.
Mr Tyler, I know you're trying to protect
your family, but you must realise
that by staying here,
you could be in serious danger.
Maybe.
But you know I was born in 1922,
in Missouri.
And my skin was as black, then,
as it is now.
So, I've had to worry about fire
bombings and beatings my entire life.
And if there's anything I learned,
it's this.
Eventually a man's got to take a stand.
I'm making mine right here.
...a sprained ankle.
- To the other side.
- Maia, how did you do today?
- Miss Skouris, can we talk?
Well, give us a sec. Can you?
Sorry I'm late again.
Please understand...
I'm afraid you can't bring Maia
back to school anymore.
We have to consider
the safety of the other students.
- Has Maia been a problem?
- Not at all. She's lovely.
But it's the bombings.
With Maia's name on that list we can't
risk having her here at school. I'm sorry.
I understand.
I'm sorry, Maia.
We'll find someplace else, I promise.
- It'll be OK.
- No, it's not OK. It's wrong.
No, I mean, someone's coming
who will make everything better.
We just have to wait a little longer.
Oh, you got too warm.
Come on. Let's look pretty.
Don't you want to look pretty?
That's better.
- Is that a blasting cap?
- It's a commercial detonator.
It'll be easier to trace
than a bottle of bleach.
We'll send it to the lab. It needs serial
numbers. Or a purchaser would be nice.
What do you have on the victim?
Mary Denneville. 27-years-old.
The flower shop was her father's.
She disappeared in 1999 but picked up
her life right where she left off.
Until today.
Are the 4400 that frightening to people?
Are we too close, so we don't see it?
Something like this isn't fear.
This is hate, pure and simple.
Baldwin.
Right now!
- What?
- We have to go in.
Nikki.
Shawn.
- There's something I need to tell you.
- I know.
- I saw you and Danny talking yesterday.
- I just... want to make one thing clear.
Me breaking up with Danny
has nothing to do with you. OK?
OK.
Do you ever feel like you just...
...wanted to get away
from your life for a while?
I did that for three years.
I don't recommend it.
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.
Find a quiet place where you
can pretend that... things are simple.
That nobody's angry at you,
or hurt or sad.
I know just the spot.
Come on. I'll take you. Yeah?
- Yeah.
- OK.
I've been studying your case files.
You're the first investigative team
I've talked to,
but it seems like
you're the right place to begin.
Where shall we start,
Orson Bailey, Oliver Knox?
How about Maia Rutledge?
Age eight. Disappeared in '46.
What about her?
It says here her foster parents returned
her to quarantine, no reason given.
Then there's all these reports of
her making predictions that come true.
Next thing, she's been removed from
quarantine by one of our field agents.
I believe it goes on to say,
"For further study".
But you haven't filed any other reports
though, have you?
All of this was approved by Ryland.
I don't see what the problem is.
Next case, Shawn Farrell, aged 17.
Disappeared in April of 2001.
It's a little thin. Isn't it, Tom?
Why don't you accuse us of whatever
it is and let us get back to work.
You two are good field agents.
But it was a mistake to let two people
with such obvious conflicts of interest
to remain on the 4400 investigation.
This is not a conflict of interest, it is
a window into these people's lives.
You have a gang task force,
you want people on it who know gangs.
We know the 4400 better than anyone.
That's why we're on this case.
- Nice spin. Is this what Ryland thinks?
- Is that all your after? Ryland?
You know it's ironic. The North-West
Division used to be a backwater.
It was given to Ryland like a pat on
the back for a career of good service.
A quiet place where he could ride out
his last years before retirement.
But his free ride ended the night
the 4400 showed up by that lake.
Now there's going to be a change
around here, whether you like it or not.
You can either be part of it
or you can get swept aside.
- Lily Moore to see you.
- Uh, send her in.
- Lily, what can I do for you?
- Um...
Yeah, Chilean sea bass?
Tenderloin medallions? Lobster sushi?
Jordan, I just asked if I could use the
common area for our support group,
I didn't mean for you to cater it
like a black tie dinner.
People want to eat whether
they're wearing tuxedos or not.
It's going to be
a really emotional night.
These people are like me. Their family
reunions didn't turn out as planned.
It's all paid for.
Anyone ever tell you
you're a control freak?
Once or twice.
Or that throwing money
at people might make them question
what you want in return?
That sounds awfully serious.
If I've made you uncomfortable...
It's just... you go so far out of your way
to make sure I'm taken care of.
You give me for than I've thought about,
or asked for or needed.
You know I'm in love with Richard, right?
Lily Moore, you are a blunt woman
and I find that attractive,
which I know was not your intent.
Look, why would I try
to break up you and Richard?
One, I'm smart enough to know I'd fail.
Two, I just would never do that.
Lily, thanks for coming by and I hope
your support group enjoys the lobster.
The William Wayne Construction
Company bought the blasting caps.
OK. Check their employee list
with the names from the Knox case.
I'm already onto it.
- I'll call you back if I find your ripple.
- Thanks.
- How is he?
- You better see for yourself.
What are you doing, buddy?
I'm looking.
- For what?
- For me.
- This is the spot?
- Yep.
Me and 4,399 of my closest friends
popped out of a ball of light right here.
It's so pretty. I wonder why
they sent you back here?
Why not on the White House lawn?
Or in the middle of Times Square?
I dunno, maybe
they just appreciate a good view.
- You think?
- I have no idea.
- You're such a jerk.
- You're just figuring that out now?
- Hey, let me see this.
- What are you doing?
Doctor's follow-up. Just...
It looks good.
I keep thinking you're still fourteen.
I'm not.
I know.
Tom? I've found something.
What do you got?
Gone.
- We've got fertiliser.
- And tyre tracks.
They've got a truck bomb.
The tyre prints matched
the phone company's service trucks.
So, we pulled their personnel records
and found one Dean Keating.
As in Gail Keating -
Friday Harbor murder victim?
- Dean's her older brother.
- Not only that.
Gail's younger brother, Glenn works
construction and on his last job
the company was short
two dozen blasting caps.
So, a returnee kills their sister
and they get revenge.
And the 4400 go from being a threat
to being sympathetic victims.
Your ripple effect.
All right, put out an APB
on Keating's truck,
and don't let it
get to where it's going.
Come on. Where are you?
Mr Tyler, we're looking for a truck
bomb. Be on high alert.
Understood. Thanks.
We're running out of time.
There! Truck number 85. That vehicle's
assigned to Dean Keating.
And it's heading north on...
Aurora.
Heading into Richmond Highlands.
We need a list of all the 4400s
in Richmond Highlands.
There's only one 4400 in that area.
It's Tom's nephew.
Tom, hold up!
Operations. Patch me through
to that phone number again.
Farrell residence.
We're not in. You know the drill.
Susan, Shawn, Danny. If you
can here this, get out of the house!
Is anyone there?
There it is. Number 85.
Get us down. Now!
Put your hands where I can see them!
Out of the truck. Keep
your hands where we can see them.
- What the hell...
- Shut up! Stay down.
- You're not Keating. Where is he?
- He didn't come in.
No explosives. The truck's clean, Tom.
They switched vans.
It's not Keating. Come on! Let's go.
We got the wrong van.
Re-check all principle targets.
Report anything suspicious.
We've got a 12ft step van
parked near Collier's housing complex.
No plates, new paint job.
That's what the phone company
uses. Patch us through to Collier's.
- Use any line you can find.
- The phones are dead.
Code Red. Main gate.
There they are. Get me over there.
Go!
I've set it. Go!
Hands over your head!
Down! Down! Down! Down!
On your stomach now!
You are being arrested as a terrorist.
You will be treated as
an enemy combatant.
You do not have the right to an attorney.
Whatever you say
will damn sure be used against you!
Doctor MacMillan to...
Doctor Mayhew. I'm Warren Lyttel
from Homeland Security.
I need to ask a
few questions about Kyle Baldwin.
- Tom, you have to come quick!
- What?
Just come!
Kyle!
What are you doing?
I know what's wrong with me.
- I finally understand.
- What is it, Kyle?
Tell me!
There's only one explanation.
Why I remember everything,
but can't feel anything.
Why all the people in my life
seem like strangers.
They're not strangers.
I am.
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.
Previously on "The 4400".
We're not sure what happened.
Something's out there.
The light has gone and
thousands of people have appeared.
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
You'll be one of the teams investigating
what happened to the returnees.
We're letting them go.
We have no right to hold them.
I'm Warren Lytell.
HomeSec mentioned I was coming.
I'm here to clean up your mess.
There's gonna be a change around here.
Be part of it or get swept aside.
I'll provide a safe haven for any 4400.
You'll be our first residents.
- I'm in love with Richard.
- Why would I break you up?
If you're on the job, I feel safe.
So does the baby.
Two happy residents. That's a start.
Maia Rutledge, aged eight.
Disappeared in '46.
She makes predictions.
Once they come true,
she's removed from quarantine
by one of our field agents.
You can't bring Maia
back to school any more.
We have to consider the other students.
- It'll be OK.
- It's not OK.
Somebody will make everything better.
Next case, Shawn Farrell, aged 17.
Disappeared in April of 2001.
It's a little thin.
Me breaking up with Danny
is not about you.
OK.
I need to ask you a few questions.
I don't know what happened.
I just put my hands on him.
Woke up...
Don't touch me.
I recognise you
but I don't know who you are.
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking.
- For what?
- For me.
I finally understand.
They're not the strangers.
I am.
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.
Kyle.
I'm not Kyle.
- Then who are you?
- I don't know.
- I need more screens.
- OK.
Your son is experiencing
a dissociative disorder.
That's common
for newly awakened coma patients.
He feels disconnected
from his personality.
We knew he'd need to adjust
but he doesn't know who he is.
This is frustrating but you did
the right thing bringing him back here.
Yeah.
- So what now?
- We need to do another cranial MRI.
They'll be here in an hour
to take him downstairs.
I know this is difficult, Tom.
But Kyle's come this far.
We can't give up now.
I think I've got the exact change.
Hello, cutie.
Thanks.
- How long have you known that man?
- Tony? About two years.
- He's nice.
- He's very nice.
- Why do you say that?
- He's going to fall in love today.
Tony? My God. Good for him.
- It's not with me, is it?
- Nope.
I didn't think so.
Is there something else, Maia?
- How long am I going to be like this?
- Like what?
I don't want to know things
before they happen.
I want to be normal, like I used to be.
It's gonna be OK, sweetie.
- Besides, who's normal anyway?
- You are.
Huh! You want to know a secret?
Normal people like me...
...they just wish
they were special, like you.
Put the television back on.
Kyle, when you came home you spent
all that time looking through your books.
Then the maps, now the TV.
What are you looking for?
Maybe we can help you look, too.
Come here.
- You should go and get some rest.
- I'm not leaving him.
All right. I'll go and grab some stuff.
Be back in a half hour, OK?
What are you doing? Leave him alone!
Who are you people?
I'm calling Security.
I'm Agent Lytell.
I work with your husband.
I don't care who you work with.
Tell Tom I figured it out.
I know where I have to be.
Don't worry. He's gonna be safe.
The government's gonna be supervising
his medical care from now on.
You snatched that kid from a hospital?
What were you thinking?
He's the only witness to an abduction.
He can't remember his own name.
Then we'll help him remember.
His mother's upset. It's understandable.
- But DC sent me...
- Tom!
- Where's my son?
- Whoa!
- Get your hands off me.
- I'll ask you one more time.
- Ryland? You wanna help me?
- It's a tough call.
- Where's Kyle?
- All right, Tom.
- Put the gun away.
- Dennis...
Tom, put the gun away.
- You should have let me pull the trigger.
- I was tempted.
But shooting Lytell won't get Kyle back.
It'd make me feel a hell of a lot better.
Why Kyle?
Why didn't he go after Shawn?
Our doctors went over Shawn
dozens of times.
- Kyle's new territory for them.
- New territory?
- That's my son.
- I know that.
- Can't you call DC?
- What good would that do?
DC put Lytell here in the first place.
- They're backing his play.
- So we do nothing?
- I didn't say that. We'll get Kyle back.
- When?
For Christ's sake, I don't know.
I just heard an hour ago.
I don't know where Lytell put him.
Not good enough, Dennis.
I'm not sitting around
while you play phone tag.
- I'm getting my son. Get your hands off.
- Tom!
We go back a long way.
If you try to go around me on this,
none of it matters.
I know.
Tom, what happened
between you and Lytell?
Ask Ryland.
Tom!
- Tom!
- What?
- If you're in trouble, I need to know.
- Why?
- Cos I might be able to help.
- Just stay out of it, all right?
Drive the car.
Blood work looks fine,
the RH factor levels are normal
and your calcium's OK.
So how do you feel, Lily?
- It's hard sometimes.
- That's to be expected.
Now, where was I?
Oh, right. I'll have to draw
some more amniotic fluid.
Why? Is something wrong?
What kind of genetic anomaly?
All I know is she wants to grow
one of the baby's chromosomes in a lab.
It'll be OK.
It's gonna be a beautiful 18 holes.
Either of you play golf?
- I'm afraid not.
- That's too bad.
Listen, about that doctor you sent us to.
Roxanne Kern. She's the best OBGYN
in the Pacific northwest.
You're in good hands. So how did
that support group meeting go?
- It went well, thank you.
- Nobody complain about the catering?
I have to admit,
the lobster sushi was a great idea.
You see? You just have to trust me.
Your girlfriend has quite an imagination.
She thought I was trying
to steal her away from you.
- Can you believe that?
- Er... not really.
I like your confidence.
See? You were worried about nothing.
I wasn't worried.
- We've gotta tell him.
- I'll do it. It should be me.
When?
Soon.
I can't take all this sneaking around.
- Besides, I miss seeing you.
- I miss you, too.
You suspected that Shawn had these
abilities since his coming home party
and you never told me.
- I never told Linda.
- You're divorcing her.
- I'm your partner.
- I know.
When we were assigned to the 4400,
you were calling them viruses.
Have you noticed any change in me?
Maybe because I have one of them
living in my apartment.
- Point taken.
- I would have told you.
I heard you, all right?
- Can we continue the reprimand later?
- Fine.
- What are we going to do about Kyle?
- "We"?
Of course "we".
We are gonna go find him
and bring him home.
Then we better get to work.
Mr Collier is not available right now.
I'll have him return your call.
Thank you, Dr Kern.
Dr Kern, the OBGYN?
- Mm-hm.
- Jordan about to have a baby?
- I wouldn't know.
- Huh.
Here's the security logs
he asked to see.
I'll put them on his desk.
Can I see Jordan's phone logs
for the last couple of weeks?
What for?
He's been receiving
some threatening mail.
I want to crosscheck it
with his incoming calls.
It doesn't leave this office.
I need to see Dr Kern right now.
Mr Tyler, she can't be disturbed.
- Mr Tyler!
- This won't take long. Dr Kern.
- She's busy.
- Does Lily have an appointment?
No. Why do you call Jordan Collier
every time she comes to see you?
- My phone habits don't concern you.
- I think they do.
What does Collier know
about Lily's baby that she doesn't?
Sickle cell anaemia?
How can my baby have the trait
for sickle cell anaemia?
Unless the father's black.
Maybe he is.
- What are you saying, Richard?
- I don't know.
Maybe whoever took us
used me as some kind of donor.
The question is, why would Jordan
have Dr Kern keep this from us?
The baby's carrying the sickle cell trait.
That brings us closer.
Maybe he doesn't want that to happen.
Maybe.
I think it's time me and him had a talk.
Michelle Hickock, returnee number 938.
She's coming in at 4:00 for counselling
and I want to see her afterwards, OK?
He's logged on.
Lytell's on the network. You good to go?
Tom really appreciates you helping him.
I'm not doing it for Tom.
Come on.
Kyle's being held at the quarantine
Centre, building 9, sub-basement 3.
That's great. I owe you.
OK. Well...
- Marco, thanks for your help.
- No worries.
- You ready to roll?
- We should wait for the nightshift.
- They're half staff.
- OK. I'll pick you up at 4:00.
See you.
This is the place. It's just outside
of the city in West Belleview.
The seller won't be there?
He's in Spain. Another realtor told me.
- It'll be a perfect safe house.
- Set it up.
- Make sure you're not followed.
- I'm being watched?
If I was Lytell, I'd keep an eye on you.
Check your mirrors and stay cool.
I never thought I'd have to use
what you taught me.
You'll do fine.
- I'll get Kyle and I'll meet you up there.
- I'll be waiting.
- You be careful.
- I will.
They're nice, huh? I remember how
much you told me you liked moonstones.
I do. But I can't accept these.
Why not? I mean, I got them for you.
Come on, Nikki.
Look, I know I messed up.
- Didn't Shawn talk to you?
- What does he have to do with it?
Nikki?
- Hey.
- Maia ready?
Maia's talking
with one of your colleagues.
Some of the clothes look funny.
And the cars.
But I don't know.
Video games are kind of fun.
Did you like the video games
at quarantine?
I hardly ever got a chance to play.
Lytell, what are you doing here?
Just talking with Maia.
I thought it was time we met.
- Stay away from her.
- That's not really your call, is it?
Maia, it was nice talking with you.
We'll do it again soon.
I don't like him.
And he doesn't really like me either.
Well, don't you worry about him.
- Are you sure?
- Oh! You listen to me, Maia.
I am absolutely sure. I am not gonna let
anything bad happen to you. Hear me?
- All right?
- OK.
Jordan, do you have a minute?
I know why you're here.
Roxanne Kern called me
as soon as you left her office.
I hope you and Lily aren't blowing this up
into something bigger than it is,
cos a doctor's
trying to get on my good side.
We appreciate everything you've done,
from the house to my job.
Our lives have been a lot more
comfortable since we met.
- You're gonna hurt me now, aren't you?
- It's time you back off.
Let us run our own lives.
Whatever you want.
Tell Lily I said hi, will you?
I'll do that.
- You good to go?
- Just give me a sec.
Gloria, don't answer the door
to anyone you don't know, OK?
Cool.
- Are you leaving now?
- Yeah. I'll be back before you wake up.
OK.
Better go. Bye.
- Diana.
- Don't worry.
- You'll find him.
- Find who?
Your son, Kyle.
He's the answer.
- The answer to what?
- Everything.
I want to see Kyle Baldwin, please.
- You're not on the list.
- I'm a friend of the family.
I want to know that he's all right.
He's not even one of the 4400
and his father works with me
and if you could just give me something
I could tell him cos...
Come on, we're both supposed
to be on the same side, right?
- I'll see what I can find out.
- Thank you so much. That's great.
You won't even have a headache
when you wake up.
Well, maybe a little headache.
Come on in.
Kyle. Hey, buddy. It's me, buddy.
- Highland Beach.
- What about it?
- That's where I have to go.
- Highland Beach.
Let's get you out of here first.
Come on. Up.
We got him.
He's sitting right here next to me.
He's about the same.
No worse, anyway.
See you in a little while.
- How far away is this safe house?
- It's about 30 miles.
Your mom's waiting for you, buddy.
No. Highland Beach.
- Hey!
- Kyle! Let go!
- Kyle!
- Highland Beach!
- Let go! Let go!
- Calm down!
- We have to go there now.
- What's at Highland Beach?
- That's where Shawn disappeared.
- I have to go back there.
Just calm down, buddy. Just...
- If that's what you want, we'll take you.
- Are you sure about that?
Kyle's the answer, right?
Two agents are operating outside us.
I noticed. It's because you pulled
the Baldwin kid out of the hospital.
- DC wouldn't see it that way.
- DC decided to send you here.
Are we gonna bring him in or not?
Find him.
These people are coming
to the next meeting.
It's bigger than the last
so we may need a couple more tables.
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.
Lily.
Can I see you for a minute?
- I have a few errands to run.
- This won't take long.
Where did you get this?
I've been doing security checks on
everyone who's moved into the complex.
Don't look shocked, Lily.
A lot of people would love
to see me fall on my face here.
A scandal like this would allow them
to force me out of the company.
- Richard wouldn't do this.
- I'd have thought so, too.
I guess we were both wrong.
Do you really think this is going
to change the way I feel about him?
That's up to you.
But Lily...
you really have to ask yourself...
Is this the man
you want raising your baby?
Aren't you gonna say something?
It was my 23rd birthday.
A bunch of guys from the barracks
invited me out to a bar.
- You don't drink.
- Didn't then either.
But it was a big deal
them asking me to come along.
In those days, Negroes and whites
didn't do much socialising.
So I went.
It was kind of nice, you know?
Then this woman started
coming onto me. People started staring.
So I figured it was time
for me to get out of there.
She followed me outside
and asked me to go home with her.
I declined respectfully.
That's when she started screaming.
- That's all that happened?
- That's all it took in 1945.
But the statement the woman made
to the police. I mean...
- It's so detailed.
- But Lily, none of it's true.
If I hadn't been exonerated
of those charges,
would the air force have sent me
to flight school? Made me a pilot?
The woman lied.
The charges got dropped.
- Why would Jordan bring this up?
- He wants you doubt me.
Doubt us.
Do you?
We've gotta pack
whatever we can in five minutes.
We're getting out of here.
They're heading west on Sandburg.
There are no freeways in that direction.
Highland Beach. That's where they're
going. Have my car brought around.
I don't care what you do, just keep your
mouth shut and stay out of my way.
Come on, Mom. Are you serious?
The movies? Like, you and me?
Is that so weird? We used to go
to the movies all the time.
When I was six.
Shawn!
You prick!
- Danny!
- Danny!
- Listen to me...
- You goddamn freak!
Danny, stop this!
Boys, please! Danny, Shawn, stop!
Stop blaming me for Nikki!
Don't you see
it's over between you two?
That's enough! Shawn, stop it!
You're killing him!
- What did you do?
- I didn't mean to do anything!
- Danny!
- Get away from him!
Shawn?
- I heard you guys shouting.
- Don't touch me.
What?
Don't touch me.
You're the only good thing that's
happened to me since I've been back.
But I can't stay here
and you can't come where I'm going.
Shawn...
I love you, Nikki.
- I love you.
- What are you doing? Shawn!
No! Stay here and talk about this.
Shawn! Shawn, what are you doing?
Shawn!
- What's all this?
- What's it look like?
Have you thought about
what you're doing?
- It is dangerous outside those gates.
- We'll risk it.
- Lily, think about the baby.
- What has the baby to do with this?
That baby could be the key to the future
and I can protect it
better than Richard or anyone.
- Lily, get in the car.
- I can't let you do that.
Stay away from her.
Argh!
Go ahead! Run!
It won't do you any good.
I will find you.
That baby belongs with me.
Kyle!
Kyle, we've been walking for ten
minutes. What are you looking for?
Maybe we can help you, Kyle.
This is where we found him.
We're running out of time.
Kyle, I brought you here like you asked.
But if there's something you need to do,
you better do it fast.
I belong here.
I tried really hard and...
no matter what I've done,
which way I've turned, it just...
It sucks.
I need to clear my head
and get away for a while.
I guess what I'm asking
is if I could stay here for a while.
Shawn, you're one of the 4400.
As far as I'm concerned,
you can stay here as long as you want.
That's great, man. Thanks. Thank you.
So, erm... tell me a little bit more
about this ability of yours.
- Any idea where we're headed?
- I'll know it when I see it.
He's gonna come after us.
The baby likes that.
You know...
It really wouldn't be so bad, would it?
If you were the father?
No, it wouldn't be bad at all.
That's their car. Let's go.
Listen, these are not criminals.
They're two of our own.
Keep your gun holstered. There's no
cause for anybody to get hurt.
Kyle, they're coming for you.
They want to take you away.
They're too late.
- Kyle!
- No! Tom, don't!
Kyle?
Tom.
- You're not my son, are you?
- No.
Kyle was meant to be a channel,
a way to communicate.
- Communicate with who?
- With you.
To guide you in your dealings
with the returnees.
But something went wrong.
Shawn interrupted the process.
That's what put him in a coma.
He was like that for three years.
Tom!
Tom.
Tom.
Who are you? What are you?
I'm human.
- Like you.
- No. You're nothing like me.
I come from a different time.
That is all.
Your future.
Is that where you took them?
My nephew and all the others?
- We needed them.
- For what?
To survive.
Skouris.
Skouris!
In my time, humanity is dying out.
You mean it's all going to end?
Everything?
- What is going on?
- Kyle brought us out here.
- Like he knew it was going to happen.
- Maybe he's not Kyle Baldwin.
He said he wasn't.
Maybe he's telling the truth.
Tom? Tom, are you all right?
We've got to do something. He could
take Baldwin with him. Or kill him.
Nobody's doing anything
until we know what's going on.
Only those we took could prevent
the catastrophe from happening.
That's why they've been altered
and seeded back into the timeline.
Why here? Why now?
Because history tells us
this is where the path to oblivion began.
And the people you took are gonna stop
that from happening? How?
They've begun their work.
And you have begun yours.
- Tom, come on.
- Do something or I will.
I need you out of there.
I don't understand.
What are we supposed to do?
- You have to help them.
- How?
Go!
How?
You're bleeding.
Oh, God. Get an ambulance. Now!
Kyle! Kyle!
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle!
Kyle! Stay with me, Kyle! Stay with me!
Stay with me! Look at me! Look at me!
Stay! Stay!
No! No!
Kyle! Kyle! Look at me! Look at me!
Stay with me, Kyle! Stay with me!
Stay with me! Come on! Come on!
- No!
- Tom...
- Dad?
- Kyle!
What are you doing here?
- Where's Shawn?
- Kyle?
- I can explain about the beer.
- No!
Forget the beer.
You don't have to explain anything.
What's going on?
Tom. Tom.
What did you see?
I got you, Kyle.
The baby.
It's time?
I'll get the car.
Précédemment dans 4400…
Une comète ne change pas de trajectoire.
- Celle ci l'a fait.
- Alors ce n'est pas une comète.
Nous ne sommes pas sûrs de ce qui arrive.
On distingue quelque chose.
La lumière a disparue,
laissant place à des milliers de personne.
Diana Skouris. Tom baldwin.
Vous deux serez une des équipes
qui enquêtera sur les revenants.
On les laisse partir.
On les laisse partir ?
On n’a aucun droit de les retenir.
Pourquoi faire disparaître une petite fille dans les années 40,
la retenir durant 60 ans
et la renvoyer avec la capacité
de prédire l'avenir.
- Je peux rentrer à la maison ?
- La maison ?
Avec vous,
je n'aime pas être seule ici.
Shawn Farrell...
- Oncle Tommy.
- Salut.
Il est tout a vous.
Et Kyle ?
Kyle est dans le coma, Shawn.
Que diable as tu fais à Kyle ?
Je ne sais pas ce qui s’est passé.
J'ai posé mes mains sur lui. C’est tout.
Il s'est réveillé.
Tu parles d'une sorte d’effet domino ?
Diana Skouris toujours
première de la classe.
Les incidents ne sont que des catalyseurs
du changement.
Je le jure devant Dieu.
je ne te le demanderai qu'une fois…
Où est mon fils ?
- Kyle ! Kyle
- Non !
Tom, Non !
Vous n'êtes pas mon fils.
Qui êtes vous ? Qu’est ce que vous êtes.?
Je suis un humain.
Je viens d'une autre époque, votre futur.
A mon époque, l'humanité est mourante.
Seuls les revenants
peuvent empêcher la catastrophe.
C'est pourquoi ils ont été modifiés
et rendus au cours du temps.
Vous voulez dire que ce sera la fin du monde ?
- Vous devez les aider.
- Les aider ? Comment ?
Papa ?
Kyle...
Je veux fournir un endroit sûr,
pour chacun des 4400 qui le souhaite.
Sale taré.
Danny, arrête ça.
Arrête de m’accuser pour Nikki !
Je suppose que ce que je demande c'est
si je peux rester ici quelques temps.
Parle moi un peu plus
de ton pouvoir...
Je n'étais pas enceinte avant l'enlèvement,
mais je l'étais à mon retour.
Ce bébé peut-être la clef pour le futur
et doit être protégé, et je peux le faire.
Fuyez !
Je vous retrouverai.
Ce bébé m'appartient.
Isabelle...
Isabelle...
Quoi, mon trésor ?
Un cauchemar ?
Toujours le même.
6 mois plus tard
Elle va bien, Richard.
On va tous bien.
Reviens te coucher.
C'est certainement un raton laveur...
C'était qui ?
Ils sont partis
avant que j’ai pu demander.
Ils ont laissés quelque chose.
Quelqu'un nous a trouvé.
Qui ?
NTAC, Collier ?
Ça ressemble
à leur carte de visite pour toi ?
Je ne sais pas qui, mais quelqu'un
sait que nous sommes des 4400.
Commence à faire les valises.
Je vais en ville demain,
prendre ma paye et on file d'ici.
Pourquoi pas maintenant ?
On aura besoin de cet argent, Lily.
Mr et Mme Sumlin.
Peter.
Si vous voulez me suivre.
Pardon pour le décor,
le centre n'ouvre
officiellement que demain.
Peter n'a plus le temps d'attendre.
C'est là où vous avez tort, Mme Sumlin.
Peter a tout le temps du monde.
Salut, Peter.
Mon nom est Jordan Collier.
Par ici.
Notre centre hospitalier n'est pas prêt.
Nous avons pensé
que Peter serait plus à l'aise ici.
Bonjour, Peter.
Je suis Shawn.
Et si on commençait ?
Ouais.
Ok, petit.
Prends mes mains.
Détends toi.
D’accord ?
C’est bon.
Tu le fais bien. Très bien.
C’est bon.
Oh, mon dieu,
il va bien ?
Il va très bien.
Observez.
C'est bon.
Tu vas bien. Tu vas bien.
Peter ?
Comment te sens-tu, mon chéri ?
Fiston ?
Merci
pour  votre généreuse donation.
On a tout essayé.
Radiothérapie, greffe de moelle osseuse…
Est  il vraiment guéri ?
Retournez voir son médecin,
faites lui passer des examens.
La  leucémie de Peter est partie.
C'est un miracle.
Pour l'instant,
cela doit rester secret.
L'accord de confidentialité
que vous avez signé le stipule.
Mais les gens devraient savoir
à propos de ce jeune homme.
Et ils le sauront.
Le moment venu.
Ils sauront tout.
Très joli.
Survole le 5. Survole le 5.
- Tu es nerveuse ?
- Pas toi ?
Non, pas du tout.
Bon, peut-être un peu.
D'accord, extrêmement.
Mais tu veux vraiment faire ça, n’est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Allons-y.
Il est dit ici qu’elle a montré une capacité
de type Dinstman-Lenhoff.
Elle a des sortes de visions prémonitoires ?
Oui, ses visions se sont arrêtés
il y a 4 mois, sans raison apparente.
Dommage,
j'allais demander si Teledex allait
exploser des prévisions trimestrielles.
On aimerait commencer
si c'est possible.
Bien sûr.
Si vous voulez signer aux endroits indiqués.
Diana Skouris, votre adoption de
Maia Rutledge est par ceci effective,
officielle, et définitive.
Attesté par moi-même, Henry Biederman,
et par le 10ème tribunal des affaires
familiales de Seattle.
Certains de nous doivent regarder
bien loin, pour trouver leur "famille".
Vous deux avez regardé
au delà du temps.
Diana laissez moi vous présentez
votre fille, Maia.
Maia, dis bonjour à Maman.
<i>Commandemant de l'Evaluation de la Menace Nationale - Seattle, Etat de Washington.</i>
Je ne le ferai pas.
Et je le pense cette fois. Y a pas moyen.
C'est juste un scanner, Kyle.
T'en as déjà eu.
Celui là va leur dire la même chose
que les 150 précédents… C'est-à-dire rien.
Il n'y a personne
d'autre que moi, là.
Je le sais,
et tôt ou tard,
ils vont arrêter de chercher.
Quand ? Quand ça ?
J'aimerais le savoir.
Mais avec le NTAC, le gouvernement,
il y a bien plus en jeux que toi ou moi, tu comprends ?
Kyle, ils veulent juste comprendre
ce qui s'est passé à Highland Beach. C’est tout.
Ils ont peur que s’ils me laissent sortir,
je révèle leur grand secret.
Ils peuvent se détendre,
je veux juste sortir d'ici
et redevenir normal.
Et les gens normaux ne radotent pas
sur le futur de l'humanité
ou sur la fin du monde.
En plus, je ne me souviens même pas
ce qu'il s'est passé.
Je sais.
Vous m'entendez ?
Je ne me souviens pas !
Calme toi.
Papa, sors moi de là.
Parle à quelqu'un,
n'importe qui. S’il te plaît, parce que…
D'accord.
C'est bon.
Ok.
Tom,
ça fait un bail, hein ?
Tu sais comment c'est.
Les bureaucrates n'ont pas beaucoup
de raison de te mettre avec un agent rebelle.
Quelqu'un s'apitoie
sur son sort aujourd'hui ?
« Le chemin de l'oubli commence ici. »
Les 4400 ont été envoyé pour sauver
l'humanité, et je suis supposé les aider...
J'étais là sur la plage, tu te souviens ?
Ils m'ont donné une mission,
Quel est ma plus belle action
de la semaine ?
J'ai convaincu
mon fils de repasser un scanner.
Et je ne suis pas sûr
que c'était ce qu'ils avaient en tête...
Diana, vous êtes prête ?
Dans une minute.
On doit contrôler 3 revenants de plus,
et je veux m'assurer
qu'on rendra le rapport avant 17h.
Pourquoi ne vas-tu pas fais chauffer la voiture ?
J'arrive.
Bien sur.
Vic Hubbard est le meilleur enquêteur
que t’aies pu trouver ?
Oh, non, c'est le 4ème cette année.
2 de plus et je bats un record.
On doit te sortir de derrière ce bureau.
Je suis déjà chanceux d'avoir un boulot ici.
J'ai braqué un autre agent,
tu te souviens ?
Ouais , bon,
j'ai pas dit que ça allait être facile.
C'est vraiment ce qui s'est passé.
Tu vas recommencer
avec les énergies négatives ?
Les trous blancs, ils sont la clef.
C'est comme ça qu’ils les ont enlevés,
et renvoyés
Mais les trous blancs... La 2ème loi de...
- Oui, parce que j’ai raison.
Voyons.
- Les gars !
- C’est comment d’avoir tort ?
J'interromps quelque chose ?
Brady en remet une couche
avec ses trous blancs, encore.
Un jour tu m'expliqueras la différence
entre les blancs et noirs.
Bien, pourquoi pas ce soir ?
Pourquoi est-ce que tu ne me donnerais
pas simplement ce dont on a parlé ?
- Je peux pas.
- Pourquoi ?
Je l'ai déjà envoyé là haut.
Je me demande si quelqu'un le lit...
Quand ce sera fait, je suis sûr
que t'en entendras parler.
Je te suis redevable, beau gosse.

Tu essayes
de me dire quelque chose.
A quel aide-soignant tu l'as volé ?
Matt ?
Arlo ?
Tu es si gentil.
Tu es la seule personne ici,
qui ne veut pas me voir morte.
J'aurais aimé t'emmener avec moi,
mais c'est impossible.
Ils ne veulent que moi.
Mais je vais partir bientôt.
Très bientôt.
Joanne ? Paul ?
Que faites vous ?
Maniaque sexuel. Ne me fais pas
ces gros yeux.
Johanne, je suis sérieux.
Pose ces trucs par terre
avant de te blesser.
On construit quelque chose.
Je le vois bien.
Vraiment ?
Ça va être gigantesque.
Enorme. Rivalisant avec les pyramides.
Mais certaines choses doivent rester
Dans l'imagination, Joanne.
En plus,
vous deux avez physiothérapie
maintenant.
Allez.
Construire quelque chose.
Construire rien du tout.
Aide moi à me débarrasser de ce foutoir.
Désolée, c'était trop fort ?
Oh, non.
Continuez, donnez le meilleur.
Quoi que vous fassiez, vous devez être
vraiment bon dedans.
Oh, oui, je travaille avec mes mains,
comme vous.
Mon appart ne ressemble pas
du tout à ici.
Ça aide d'avoir des amis bien placés.
Je suis toujours prête
à me faire de nouveaux amis.
Entrez.
En parlant du loup.
Laissez nous.
Quelqu'un vous a déjà dit
que vos arrivées était craignos ?
Si quelqu’un l'a fait, je l’ai viré.
Pour toi.
Ça sort demain.
Jordan, ça va se vendre
par million.
Les gens vont flipper
quand ils liront ça.
Les grandes idées
font beaucoup de bruit, Shawn.
Vous  vouliez me voir, Nina ?
Vous couchez avec Tom Baldwin ?
Je devrais refaire une entrée, non ?
On pourrait peut-être recommencer…
Répondez à la question !
Même pas une poignée de main.
Vous lui devez de l'argent ?
Quel jeu on joue, là ?
Si je connaissais les règles...
Je joue au jeu de la salle des Théories
- Je ne connais pas celui là.
- Laissez moi vous donner un indice.
"La nécessité de l'immédiate réassignation
de Thomas Baldwin à son poste sur le terrain."
Un titre accrocheur.
Vous avez trouvé ça toute seule,
ou ce sont les cerveaux du sous sol ?
Disons que je suis d'accord avec l'idée.
Tom est le meilleur agent avec lequel
j'ai bossé, peut être le meilleur de la division.
Pendant les 3 mois ou Baldwin a enquêté
sur les 4400,
ce département en a appris plus
que durant toute cette année
où il a trié de la paperasse.
Il a menacé la vie d'un autre agent.
Il essayait de protéger son fils,
que ces hommes du futur, ou quoi qu'ils soient,
ont pris pour porte-parole.
Sans mentionner
que son neveu Shawn est un 4400.
C'est un énorme
conflit d'intérêt pour moi.
Ce n'est pas
ce que Dennis Ryland pensait.
Dennis Ryland n'est plus en poste ici.
Vous devriez appeler Washington et
lui parler.
Je n'ai pas à appeler Washington.
On est en ligne directe.
Députés, sénateurs,
commissions, sous-commissions
tous observent ce département, et ils m'observent,
pour avoir des réponses.
Voilà pourquoi vous ne pouvez pas
garder Tom Baldwin hors jeu.
C'est un atout majeur, dans cette affaire.
Peut être l'atout majeur.
C'est drôle,
c'est exactement ce qui est dit dans ce mémo.
Peut être que Marco m'a demandé
de vérifier la typo.
La prochaine fois que vous voulez
me faire passer un message,
mettez votre nom.
Mr Walcott !
Descendez de là.
Arlo !
Mr Walcott, descendez de là !
Arlo ! Vous avez entendu le monsieur.
Mr Walcott,
descendez tout de suite !
J'appelle la sécurité
si vous ne descendez pas immédiatement.
Arlo !
C'est votre dernière chance.
Que diable fais-tu là haut ?
Je l'ai.
Arlo !
Arlo,  dernier avertissement !
Arlo, s'il te plait.
Soyez prudent !
Je descends.
Arlo attention.
Regarde ce que tu fais !
Je l'ai.
Je l'ai !
Oh, oh... oh, mon dieu.
Oh, mon dieu !
Non !
Lily, je suis rentré.
Lily, détends-toi, on n'est plus obligés de partir.
Un dingue a placardé ça dans toute la ville.
Il ne nous a pas repairé.
Je crois quand même
qu'on devrait partir.
J'avais peur hier aussi.
Mais tu as lu ça ?
C'est un délire
pas une chasse aux sorcières.
Peut-être, mais Richard,
On ne se sent plus en sécurité ici.
Tu veux dire qu'Isabelle ne
se sens plus protégée.
Richard, on en a déjà parlé une douzaine de fois.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
elle me parle qu’à moi et pas à toi...
Parle ?
Communique. Qu'importe.
Est-ce qu’elle a dit où on devrait aller ?
Elle a déjà choisi un lieu,
ou elle saura en le voyant ?
On peut trouver une ville.
On l'a déjà trouvée, ici.
Isabelle a 6 mois.
Je sais qu'elle est spéciale,
mais nous sommes ses parents.
Nous prenons les décisions
pour elle, pas le contraire.
Je sais. Il est temps de partir d'ici.
Tu as raison.
Tu as tout à fait raison.
On reste ici.
Maia ?
c'est la fête.
Des macaroni aux fromages, de la purée
de pommes de terre, et du pain blanc.
Tout ce que j'aime.
Les seules choses que tu manges.
Promets-moi de dépasser cette phase bientôt.
Maman, comment tu fais pour que
ce soit si bon ?
Un talent caché, je suppose.
Tu viens de m'appeler maman.
Tu es ma maman maintenant, pas vrai ?
Maintenant, et pour toujours.
- J'aime bien ça.
- Moi aussi.
Tu penses que je pourrai
retourner à l'école ?
Tu n'étais pas en train de me dire
que tu as eu 97 à ton test de Maths ?
Pas l'école à domicile.
La vraie école.
Avec un terrain de jeu
et des récréations.
Eh bien, oui, tu y retourneras…
Quand  tu seras un peu plus grande...
Grande comment ?
Je n'ai plus de prémonitions,
alors je devrais pouvoir être avec d'autres enfants.
Je pense que je serais heureuse à l'école.
Eh bien, tu es heureuse maintenant.
Je suis contente que tu sois ma maman pour de vrai,
- mais je pourrais quand même avoir, genre une amie ou deux.
- ahh...
Encore des macaronis au fromage, s'il te plait.
Juste un peu.
Signez ça.
Qu'est ce que c'est ?
Votre lettre de démission.
Je pensais être à nouveau sur le terrain.
Vous l'êtes.
C'est effectif immédiatement.
Je veux des résultats.
Nous avons une collection précieuse de diplômés au sous-sol
qui me disent que vous êtes le meilleur moyen d’en obtenir.
Je suis donc disposée à prendre ce risque.
Mais j'ai besoin de garanties.
Ceci.
Je n'ai pas mis de date.
Si vous dépassez les limites, je remplis la case.
C'est juste.
Bien.
Là. Regardez ça.
Tess Doerner.
Diagnostic de schizophrénie paranoïaque à l'âge de 15 ans.
Disparue de l'hôpital psychiatrique d'Abendson en avril 1955.
Laissez-moi deviner, ils l'ont renvoyée sans se soucier de la guérir ?
Guérir les gens ne faisait sûrement pas partie de leur plan.
On vient de recevoir un appel à propos de l'hôpital.
Un de leurs infirmiers est mort.
Il prétend qu'il y a un rapport.
On va vérifier ça.
Attends.
Il y a encore un élément du deal qu'on doit régler.
Vous imposez des conditions ?
C'est ta nouvelle maison ?
C'est aussi la tienne.
Toutes tes affaires sont ici. Je...
On dirait ton ancienne chambre, tu ne trouves pas ?
J'ai essayé au moins.
Il y a juste une chose qui manque...
Maman.
Je sais. Parfois je n'arrive pas non plus à croire qu'elle ne soit plus là.
Mais on a essayé, Kyle, tu sais,
on a vraiment voulu que ça marche.
J'aurais aimé que vous essayiez un peu plus sérieusement.
Désolé, c'est juste que...
Tu sais, quand quelque chose d'horrible se passe au sein d'une famille,
comme quand tu étais à l'hôpital, ça peut...
rapprocher les gens, ou bien...
les éloigner. Ta mère et moi...
Je vais devoir l'appeler, pour qu'elle sache que je suis sorti de quarantaine.
Oui, bonne idée. Tu sais, elle sera vraiment contente...
Shawn va halluciner, lui aussi.
Quoi ? Tu savais que je voudrais le voir, non ?
Tu es un bon cousin.
Ne te fais pas trop d'illusions. Les gens changent en 4 ans, tu sais.
Je n'arrive pas à croire que tu sois ici. Je...
J'ai attendu ce moment trop longtemps.
Hé...
Tu te souviens combien on aimait aller dans les cages pour frapper des balles ?
Tu n'arrivais jamais à renvoyer les balles courbes.
Moi ? Non, c'était toi,
J'ai gardé plein de monnaie, alors si tu veux...
On pourrait aussi s'arrêter au practice ?
Tu veux apprendre à jouer au golf ?
J'ai toujours voulu t'apprendre !
Il y a beaucoup de choses que je veux essayer à présent, papa.
Fais une liste. Quoique tu veuilles, on le fera.
Tout ce que tu veux.
Tu me la montreras ce soir, d'accord ?
Tu t'en vas déjà ? Je viens juste d'arriver !
C'est mon boulot, mon pote.
Tu peux commencer ta liste maintenant.
On prend vraiment les travaux manuels au sérieux ici, hein ?
Vous êtes sûr que Tess a dessiné ça avant qu'ils ne commencent à construire ça ?
Elle a fait son premier croquis il y a 2 semaines.
Ils ont commencé à monter ce truc hier.
Et vous pensez que l'infirmier qui est mort a un rapport avec tout ça ?
Arlo était sur la corniche du bâtiment B, en train de forcer pour détacher une girouette.
Je pense que c'était cette girouette.
Mais pourquoi ne confinez vous pas tous les autres patients dans leur chambre ?
Ca m'a traversé l'esprit, mais ce genre de comportement coopératif est sans précédent avec de telles maladies.
En plus, je voulais que voyiez ce truc avant qu'on ne le détruise à nouveau.
Tout va bien, Kevin.
Ils sont là pour parler avec Tess, c'est tout.
Il est très protecteur avec elle.
C'est sa seule amie ici.
Tout va bien, vraiment.
Je vais la prévenir de votre arrivée.
Bien.
Nous avons vu certains de vos dessins, Tess. Ils sont vraiment bons.
Ils vont vous entendre.
Il y a des micros dans les murs.
Ils émettent par satellite, vers les sous-marins.
Qui ça ?
Les médecins.
Les médecins de cet hôpital ?
Certains sont dans cet hôpital.
D'autres se trouvent dans le sous-marin.
D'accord, on va parler moins fort.
Ils ont pris mes crayons, mais c'était trop tard.
Ah oui ? Pourquoi ça ?
Parce que ce sera construit de toutes façons.
Ils veulent qu'on soit en contact,
c'est pour ça qu'ils ont mis les plans dans ma tête.
On parle des médecins de l'hôpital, là, ou bien de ceux
qui sont sous la mer ?
Ni l'un ni l'autre.
On parle des gens qui m'ont enlevée...
...idiot.
Donc, les gens qui vous ont enlevée...
ils veulent que les malades d'ici construisent cette tour ?
Ils feraient n'importe quoi pour me renvoyer.
Ils m'aiment bien.
C'est vous qui avez demandé de l'aide aux autres malades, Tess ?
Je n'aime pas leur parler.
Ils sont cinglés.
Est-ce qu'Arlo était cinglé ?
Je n'ai jamais pensé qu'il l'était...
mais peut-être que la folie est contagieuse.
Pour mon premier jour de reprise, avec quoi je me retrouve ?
Trois fois rien.
Juste une bande de malades mentaux construisant un engin
pour contacter le futur.
C'est ce que pense Tess en tout cas.
Elle pense aussi qu'il y a des médecins sous l'océan Pacifique,
qui écoutent une transmission radio de ses conversations privées.
Ca pourrait être un genre d'hystérie collective.
Même si ça n'explique pas le cas Arlo.
C'est un infirmier d'un certain âge que sa femme a quitté.
Ca pourrait être un suicide.
Il aurait renoncé à la dernière minute,
et se serait agrippé à la girouette ?
Je me demande depuis quand Marco n'a pas vu le soleil, tu vois ?
Je pensais qu'on pourrait l'emmener ici
jeter un oeil sur ce truc qu'ils construisent.
Une virée pour Marco ?
Il lui arrive de prendre l'air, Tom,
et puis tu sais, on pourrait facilement se procurer de la crème solaire.
Ce serait incroyable, quand même ?
Si elle pouvait vraiment le faire. Contacter le futur.
Tess a raison.
La folie est sûrement contagieuse.
Il me dictait une lettre.
Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé. Il a attrapé sa tête et a commencé à crier.
Attendez dehors. Tout de suite.
Calmez-vous. Calmez-vous.
Merci.
Elles empirent.
Jordan...
Elles reviennent plus souvent aussi.
- Ca va ?
- Je vais bien.
Je ne comprends pas. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi ces attaques
continuent de survenir.
J'ai guéri...
l'emphysème, la leucémie...
des fractures...
Ce bébé vous a vraiment mis au tapis.
Eh bien, souviens-toi de ça quand on retrouvera Richard et Lily.
On dirait que vous êtes très confiant là dessus, mais ça fait 1 an, Jordan.
J'oublie parfois qu'ils ne sont pas ici.
Moi, je n'oublie jamais,
et les hommes que j'ai payés pour les trouver non plus.
Ok, mais si j'étais vous,
je n'aimerais pas me trouver dans le même fuseau horaire que ce gamin.
Si vous vous rencontrez à nouveau,
ça pourrait vous achever.
J'ai mes raisons.
- Repose-toi maintenant, ok ?
- D'accord.
C'est un grand jour demain.
<i>En titre de ce journal,</i>
<i>des révélations à propos des origines des 4400.</i>
<i>Dans son autobiographie sortie aujourd'hui,</i>
<i>l'ancien magnat de l'immobilier, Jordan Collier, affirme</i>
<i>que les 4400 ont été enlevés</i>
<i>par des humains venant du futur.</i>
<i>Le livre contient des copies de documents gouvernementaux, dont Collier prétend</i>
<i>qu'elles prouvent ses dires.</i>
<i>Les documents viendraient d'une source anonyme au sein du commandement national de l'évaluation de la menace.</i>
<i>Selon Collier,</i>
<i>les 4400 ont été renvoyés pour empêcher la catastrophe qui menacerait la survie de l'humanité.</i>
Pourquoi tu ne m'en as pas parlé ?
<i>Collier ajoute</i>
<i>que le gouvernement avait cette information depuis plus d'un an,
mais l'a gardée secrète afin d'éviter une panique générale.</i>
<i>Le gouvernement déclare que ces documents sont
purement spéculatifs et ont été cités hors contexte.</i>
Rien à foutre de qui les a enlevés.
Rien à foutre de qui les a renvoyés. Le gouvernement aurait du les garder derrière des barreaux.
T'as pas entendu ce que ce mec dit ? Ils sont là pour sauver le monde.
Qu'est ce que tu voulais qu'il dise d'autre ? C'est l'un d'entre eux.
T'es bien silencieux.
Je ne crois que ce que je vois...
Et ce que je vois c'est que...
je dois vider ce radiateur avant le déjeuner.
Vous serez heureux d'apprendre que la source anonyme de M. Collier ne l'est plus.
L'agent Hubbard sera poursuivi dans toute l'étendue de la loi.
Qu'est ce qu'on fait avec Collier ?
Ce type a acheté des secrets d'état au marché noir.
Je suis sure que tout le monde ici voudrait voir Collier accusé de trahison, mais c'est peu probable.
Et je doute qu'on arrive à remonter les paiements jusqu'à lui.
Maintenant,
pour ce qui est de ce qu'ils appellent "le Centre 4400",
il est sous surveillance 24h/24 jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
Je veux des photos de quiconque s'approche à moins de 100 mètres de cet endroit.
Est-il exact que Collier est en train d'essayer d'obtenir un statut qui l'exonère d'impôts ?
Apparemment.
Il transforme les 4400 en une sorte de religion ?
Plutôt en un culte.
Oui enfin, c'est comme ça que les grosses congrégations
appellent une petite congrégation.
Culte, religion, peu importe. Sur quoi est-ce qu'il le base ?
Vous avez lu ce truc ?
Collier prétend qu'il peut révéler un 4400 à l'intérieur de n'importe qui.
Donc il espère qu'un gars qui pointe à Pittsburgh
va croire qu'il a un genre de superpouvoir latent ?
La plupart des 4400 n'ont même pas ce genre de capacités.
Pas encore, à vrai dire.
Non, mais si vous pensiez qu'il y a une chance
que vous ayez un pouvoir caché en vous...
On dirait que vous êtes prête à vous inscrire.
Non,
mais je ne blâmerais personne d'être curieux.
Il faut continuer à dire aux gens que, biologiquement,
les 4400 ne sont pas différents de nous autres.
Ils n'ont pas été altérés génétiquement, ni neurologiquement...
Autant qu'on puisse le dire.
Mais si Collier croit que les gens vont gager leur vie
et leurs économies pour une sorte de...
système pyramidal métaphysique, alors...
le réveil va être brutal.
Bienvenue au Centre. Je m'appelle Devon.
- Comment vous appelez-vous ?
- Kyle
Enchantée, Kyle. Je vous inscris pour une visite ?
Merci. Je cherche juste mon cousin, Shawn Farrell ?
Je suis désolée, M. Farrell n'est pas disponible pour l'instant.
Vous pourriez lui dire que Kyle le cherche ? Il vit ici, n'est ce pas ?
J'ai bien peur que nos règles nous interdisent de parler de nos membres.
Je ne cherche pas à discuter. Je veux juste saluer mon cousin.
Si vous voulez bien me laisser vos nom et numéro...
Je ne vous laisse rien du tout ! Quel est le problème ?
Il n'y a aucun problème.
Alors dites à Shawn que je suis là ! S'il ne veut pas me voir, très bien, mais c'est lui que ça regarde, ok ?
Pourriez-vous baisser d'un ton, s'il vous plaît ?
Ecoutez, je n'ai rien contre vous. Personnellement,
j'espère que vous, le robot, vous retrouverez votre corps un jour.
Si c'est ça, je trouverai Shawn moi-même.
Par ici, monsieur.
- Lâchez-moi !
- Vous devez partir.
Vous ne m'aviez pas dit que ce truc était si gros.
- Il ne l'était pas.
- Pas hier.
Et eux, on ne dirait pas que ce sont des patients.
Ils ne le sont pas.
Dr. Clayton !
Je sais ce que vous allez dire. On a pris du retard.
On rattrapera le temps perdu cet après-midi.
Bon, est-ce que tout l'hôpital travaille sur cet engin ?
C'est le seul moyen d'y arriver.
Excusez-moi.
Randy, Winston, on a besoin d'aide par ici.
Dr. Cho est de retour avec la parabole.
Ok.
Les patients d'abord, et maintenant le personnel.
S'il s'agit d'hystérie collective, c'est en train de s'étendre.
Qui c'est l'amour de papa ?
Ta maman...
et Isabelle.
Si, c'est vrai.
Tu sais ce qu'il voit quand il te regarde ?
Hein ?
Un bébé magnifique. Si, c'est vrai.
Mais maman voit bien plus que ça,
Et tu sais pourquoi ?
Parce que tu communiques avec maman.
Mais tu ne parles jamais à ton papa.
Alors qu'est ce que tu en dis ?
Tu veux dire quelque chose à ton papa ?
Hein ?
Parce que je t'écoute.
Comme tu veux.
Je suppose que j'en suis réduit à me débrouiller tout seul.
Richard. On doit acheter ce bouquin, je veux le lire.
Tout comme moi, mais j'ai regardé en ville.
Ils n'auront aucun exemplaire avant demain.
Je ne sais pas pour toi, mais je me fais à
l'idée qu'on ne saura jamais d'où elle est venue.
Eh bien, si nous sommes allés dans le futur, au moins nous sommes revenus avec un souvenir.
Les gens qui nous ont enlevés,
ils ont fait se produire tout ce qui est arrivé, n'est-ce pas ?
Ils se sont assurés qu'on ait Isabelle.
Ils doivent prévoir quelque chose pour elle.
Je prévois aussi quelque chose pour elle,
une vie normale.
Ce serait super mais,
ça fait longtemps qu'on a dit adieu à la normalité.
C'est scandaleux ! On a un travail à finir, ici. Un travail important.
Les médecins veulent travailler. Dites leur de faire leurs
visites. Personne ne les empêche de s'occuper de leurs patients.
A partir de maintenant,
- la tour et la cour intérieure sont interdites, compris ?
- Compris.
Mec, regarde la taille de ce truc.
Ca me déplairait pas d'en avoir un comme ça dans mon jardin.
Ta virée est finie. Va attendre dans la voiture.
Donc hier, quelques patients ne pouvaient pas s'empêcher de travailler sur cette chose,
et aujourd'hui, c'est l'hôpital entier.
Si on sort Tess d'ici,
est-ce que tu penses que cette aliénation va s'atténuer ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ca vaut le coup d'essayer, non ?
Ok, je te tiens.
Tout va bien.
Je ne suis pas une personne mauvaise.
Vraiment pas.
Personne n'a dit ça, Tess.
Alors pourquoi est-ce que vous allez m'enfoncer des fils dans le cerveau ?
Je te promets, Tess, que personne ne vas te faire de mal.
C'est ce que tout le monde dit, juste avant de vous faire mal.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'on me puni ? Je suis gentille. Vraiment. Je leur obéis, c'est tout.
Les gars ! Les gars ! Ramenez-vous !
Kevin !
Ok, Tess. Allons-y. Allez.
- Tout va bien.
- Kevin...
- Est-ce que tu as un 7 ?
- Tu pioches.
Je suis désolée d'être en retard.
Qui est-ce qu'on a là ?
C'est Carrie. Elle habite à l'étage en dessous.
Le monsieur d'UPS a laissé leur colis ici par erreur,
et quand sa maman est venue le chercher, Carrie était avec elle,
et maintenant je suis invitée à sa fête d'anniversaire,
et à rester dormir.
Je peux y aller, dis ?
Bonjour, Carrie.
Je m'appelle Diana.
Enchantée de vous connaître.
Enchantée de te connaître.
Je lui ai déjà dit d'accord.
Eh bien, je pense qu'on devrait d'abord en parler à la mère de Carrie, non ?
Oh, d'accord, tu sais quoi ? C'est bon tu peux y aller.
Merci, merci, merci, merci.
Vous ne m'avez jamais dit que j'étais prisonnier.
Tu as déjà vu une cellule de prison, Shawn ? Ca n'a rien à voir avec ton appartement.
Bon sang, Jordan, depuis quand est-ce que vous décidez
qui je peux voir et à qui je peux parler ?
C'est à propos de ton cousin, n'est-ce pas ?
Donc vous savez qu'il est venu.
Je sais qu'il a été grossier et agressif, et qu'il a du être escorté dehors.
Vous voulez dire jeté dehors.
Ca aurait pu se passer plus doucement, Shawn,
mais à tout prendre, je dirais que c'était mieux ainsi.
Kyle est mon ami.
Il était ton ami.
Ecoute, il y a un an, tu es venu me voir
parce que tu cherchais une nouvelle vie,
la tienne était en pagaille.
Kyle, ami ou pas,
fait partie de cette ancienne vie.
Qu'est ce que vous voulez que je fasse ?
Couper les ponts avec lui et oublier qu'il existe ?
Il n'est pas différent de ta mère, de ton frère ou de ton amie Nikki.
Je ne vous permets pas...
Ils ne comprennent pas ce qu'on essaye d'accomplir ici.
Vous savez, peut-être que moi non plus.
Alors je te suggère de prendre
tes affaires et de partir
Et que se passera t'il la prochaine fois que vous
hurlerez de douleur ?
Fais ce qui est juste pour toi Shawn,
je prendrai soin de moi.
Je viens de recevoir les résultats de Tess
Laisse moi deviner...
En bonne santé sur toute la ligne ?
Tu peux dire ça pour tous les 4400...
ils sont tous identiques.
Tess a dessiné le croquis...
d'une tour, d'un monument...
Oui, ou d'une balise...
Et les gens autour d'elle ont tout laissé tomber
et ont commencé à la construire
Ils n'ont plus de libre arbitre.
Ils doivent travailler
C'est comme chez les fourmis.
Venez ici.
La reine sécrète une substance chimique,
qui dicte aux autres fourmis ce qu'elles doivent faire
Les ouvriers ne s'arrêteront pas de travailler
tant que la tâche n'est pas terminée.
ils ne se soucient pas si l'un d'eux meurt,
ou si
une tempête arrive et balaie la fourmilière
Ils continuent simplement à travailler...
A moins que vous n'enleviez la reine.
Espérons que nos ouvriers fonctionnent ainsi.
Donc le futur nous a renvoyé
une reine fourmi schizophrène,
avec un plan pour quoi ?
Une sorte de talkie-walkie interstellaire.
Voyons ce que Tess peut nous dire.
Nous ne devrions pas trop nous en approcher,
car si ta théorie est juste,
n'importe qui exposé à elle serait vulnérable.
Bien, j'irai parler à Tess. Vous, vous vérifiez
avec Garrity à l'hôpital.
Ces amis à vous,
ceux qui vous ont enlevés,
que pensez vous qu'ils veulent nous dire ?
ils sont beaucoup plus futés que vous,
Ce n'est même pas amusant.
Oui, et bien...
Oui, je n'en doute pas.
Je veux dire, ils ont découvert comment vous enlever
et comment vous ramener.
Me renvoyer était une erreur, et ils le savent.
Je suis supposée être toujours là bas.
C’est où, exactement, "là bas" ?
Il y avait aussi des docteurs là bas.
Ils étaient gentils, tous gentils.
Ils étaient gentils.
Vous vous souvenez où vous avez été emmenée ?
Nous dormions beaucoup,
mais pas tout le temps.
Nous portions des vêtements gris.
Il y avait un building géant.
Les docteurs portaient des vestes brillantes.
Cela me manque tellement.
Continuez.
J'aimerais vraiment vous entendre parler de ça.
Nos chambres avaient des fenêtres rondes.
De hautes portes voûtées.
Les pierres étaient gravées.
Des symboles mathématiques ou quelques choses comme ça,
des inscriptions,
des fioles de métaux violacés,
Des tiges aux bouts colorés.
Ces symboles, Tess, à quoi ressemblaient-ils ?
Tess ?
Tess ? Vous souvenez-vous ce que les inscriptions disaient?
Ils attendent de mes nouvelles.
J'ai besoin d'être en contact avec eux.
Tess, Tess attendez...
Tess, attendez.
Garrity, pourquoi n'avez-vous pas pris votre portable ?
Je suis désolé.
C'est une peu la folie par ici.
Donc, tout va bien ?
Oui, tout va bien.
Nous avons presque fini ici.
fini ?
Et bien, l'antenne parabolique est un peu dure à hisser,
mais nous y arriverons.
Allez tout le monde. Sécurisons cette antenne.
Nous n'avons pas toute la journée.
Je viens d'avoir une conversation des plus incroyables avec Tess
Et bien elle ne peut pas être plus incroyable
que celle que je viens d'avoir avec Garrity.
Je dois dire que je ne le vois pas de cette façon.
Il n'y a pas d'autre façon de le voir.
Ce livre est blasphématoire.
Et bien ne l'achetez pas si c'est ce que vous pensez.
"Le 3éme ange souffla dans sa trompette, et une grande
étoile tomba du paradis, brûlante comme une torche."
Révélations, chapitre 8, verset 10.
Je vais vous croire sur parole.
" Le jour de leur retour
marqua le commencement de la fin des temps. "
On dirait que vous y avez réfléchi un peu plus que moi.
Soit vous enlevez ce livre de votre magasin,
soit mon fils le fera pour vous
Un peu, qu’il le fera !
Savez vous ce que vous tenez là, madame ?
C'est juste un livre.
C'est la porte de l'enfer.
C'est votre enfant ?
C'est ma fille.
Les abominations engendrent des abominations.
Richard !
Qu'est ce qui ce passe ?
Nous devons partir d'ici.
Maintenant.
Ok...
Shérif, que diable se passe-t-il ?
Les nouveaux gars que vous nous avez envoyés sont nuls.
Park m'avait dit qu'il avait de l'expérience
avec les chalumeaux.
Expérience en quoi ? A allumer des feux ?
Maintenant notre programme tombe à l'eau.
L'un d'entre vous a appelé les pompiers ?
Il est temps d'y aller
Vite, Richard.
Vite !
A partir de cette nuit, l'hôpital d'Abendson
est officiellement en quarantaine.
Les patients resteront enfermés.
Le personnel hospitalier et celui de l'NTAC qui a été infecté,
seront confinés dans l'hôpital jusqu'a ce que nous
isolions la source de la contamination.
Ca parait être un bon plan,
mais qui les surveillera ?
La dernière équipe que nous avons envoyée à été
contaminée en quelques heures.
Ce qui est, pour être franc,
un peu perturbant,
si vous considérez cela comme une épidémie...
Au CDC, nous appelons Tess
"le vecteur unique de la maladie."
Vous l'éloignez, vous enlevez l'envie de construire,
Excepté, autant qu’on le sache,...
qu'aucun de ces agents n'a eu de contact avec Tess.
Donc c'est comme la grippe,
ou tout autre virus aérophile.
Vous l'attrapez, vous pouvez le transmettre.
Quoi qu'il en soit, qu'est ce que cette chose est censée être ?
Mon avis, et je ne peux souligner
le mot "avis" suffisamment,
est que Tess nous a dit la vérité.
C'est une sorte de dispositif de communication.
Pour contacter qui ?
Le futur ?
La seule façon de le savoir
et de laisser les patients finir la construction.
Cette nuit là sur la plage d'Highland, ils ont essayé de
nous dire quelque chose. La conversation a été coupée trop tôt
C'est pourquoi nous sommes restés
dans le noir l'année dernière.
Tess est la seule 4400
qui se souvient où elle a été emmenée...
Non, elle prétend se souvenir où elle a été emmenée.
Elle est aussi la seule paranoïaque schizophrène,
Et cela me fait penser que vous deux
avez passé un peu trop de temps prés d'elle.
Heu, peut être que j'ai attrapé le bug aussi,
mais, heu...
Je suis d'accord avec eux.
L'avis de quarantaine pour l'hôpital reste effectif,
jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
Les gardes effectueront des rotations
pour minimiser le risque d'exposition.
Bon, où est-ce que cela nous mène ?
Jusqu'a ce que nous soyons sûrs
que la contamination ne se répand plus,
vous deux ne vous approcherez pas de ce bâtiment.
Isabelle s'est endormie.
Les jours pluvieux arrivent plus rapidement que prévu.
Tu penses qu'on les a semés ?
Je ne suis pas encore prêt à m'arrêter pour un pique-nique.
J'ai 1200 dollars ici.
Et 300 dans ma poche.
J'en ai aussi.
Nous allons devoir remplacer les vitres arrière dans la matinée.
Ce devrait-être suffisant pour aller jusqu'au Montana.
Qu'est ce que Eric a dit quand tu l'as appelé ?
Il a été un peu surpris d'avoir de mes nouvelles,
mais même en quarantaine,
il avait l'habitude de nous dire que les 4400 devaient rester soudés.
Oui, nous n'avions pas beaucoup d'autre choix,
n'est ce pas ?
La banque nous virera nos économies quand nous y arriverons.
Si les choses vont très mal, nous pouvons vendre ça.
Je t'ai donné cet anneau pour toujours.
Il semble que toi et Isabelle aviez raison.
Nous aurions du partir quand nous en avions l’occasion.
Ca va être une longue nuit.
Tu veux que je conduise un peu ?
Dors un peu.
Maia, qu'est ce qui ne va pas ?
Je suis désolée.
Je sais qu'il est tard, mais...
Maia avait vraiment envie de rentrer à la maison.
Qu'est ce qu'il y a, chérie ?
Je n'ai pas envie d'en parler.
Quelques une des filles,
pas ma fille, mais
quelques une des autres filles,
ont taquiné Maia.
Je crois qu'elle leur a dit qu'elle
avait le béguin pour Franck Sinatra.
Et bien, vu ses yeux bleus... vous lui en voudriez ?
Beaucoup d'enfants de 9 ans ne savent même pas qui était Franck Sinatra.
Je veux aller au lit.
Je pense que c'était un peu dur.
Je me sens confuse.
Peut être que Maia pourrait revenir une autre fois ?
Juste elle et Carrie.
Oui. Nous en discuterons.
Merci.
- Bonne nuit.
- Bonne nuit.
Maia.
Je sais que tu ne t'endors pas aussi vite.
C'était horrible.
Tu avais raison.
Et bien, je n'avais pas envie d'avoir raison.
Je n'ai pas besoin d'amis.
Tout le monde a besoin d'amis, Maia.
Allez, je pense vraiment que nous devrions parler de ça.
Eh bien pas moi.
Les hamburgers de chez Buck.
Aussi bon que dans mes souvenirs.
Tu as des choses étranges sur ta liste des priorités,
mais, tu sais quoi ?
Je suis heureux d'avoir pu faire que tes rêves deviennent réalité.
Kyle, tu ne devrais pas être au lit ?
Papa, j'ai 21 ans.
Oui, je dois m'en souvenir...
Je vais faire du pop-corn. T'en veux un peu ?
Tu te fous de moi.
Tu peux encore manger ?
J'ai mangé de la bouffe de quarantaine pendant un an.
Vous devez veiller à la sécurité du pays,
mais votre cafétéria pue.
Allo ?
Allo ?
Kyle.
Nous devons éloigner le bébé du froid.
Je ne pense pas qu'il y ait des hôtels sur cette route.
Je pensais nous allions plein sud,
prendre la 35éme.
Ce type devrait baisser ses phares.
C'est la première voiture que nous croisons depuis, quoi...
13 kms ?
Garde la tête baissée.
Oh, mon dieu, Richard.
C'est eux.
Tiens bon ! Tiens bon !
Tout le monde va bien ?
Oui je pense.
Ok, allons y.
Dispersez vous.
Hé, Maia, chérie.
C'est l'heure de se réveiller.
- Ok.
- Heu ?
Ce fut une longue nuit, hein ?
D'accord. 15 minutes de plus.
Tu sais quoi ?
Frank Sinatra est le plus cool,
et ne laisse personne te dire que tu es différente.
Donc tu n’en as lu aucune ?
Non, je ne voudrais pas que
ma fille lise mon journal intime.
Tu tiens un journal intime ?
J'ai raison ?
Allez, ne t’envoies pas de fleurs.
Donc tu ne sais pas vraiment
si "ce qu'elle voit" concerne...
ce qu'elle fait dans la journée,
des émissions de télé, des poneys, n'importe quoi...
ou c'est peut être "ce qu'elle voit,"
une semaine, un mois, une année au final.
Elle n'a plus eu une seule de ces visions depuis 4 mois.
Oui, c'est ce qu'elle t’a dit, en tout cas.
Pourquoi elle mentirait ?
Elle veut être normale, n'est ce pas ?
A chaque fois qu'elle fait une prédiction,
quelqu'un la traite d'anormale.
Ecoute, je comprends.
Tu es sa mère maintenant.
Il y a certaines règles.
Pourquoi je ne jetterais pas un coup d'oeil
la prochaine fois?
Tu penses que ça serait une sorte de trahison ?
Le fait de respecter la vie privée de Maia est important,
mais
tu dois mettre ça dans la balance en face des informations
que ce journal pourrait contenir.
Tu sais quoi ?
Quand tu perds la confiance en tes parents,
c'est très difficile de la retrouver,
Et oui, je parle en connaissance de cause.
Hé.
Je suis heureux que ce ne soit pas ma décision,
mais si Maia a des visions, tu devrais être au courant,
et tu devrais savoir ce qu'elles disent.
C'est grave ?
Je me la suis coincée quand on a quitté la route.
J'ai juste besoin de s’éloigner encore un peu.
Nous suivrons cette rivière vers le sud.
on marchera un peu dans l'eau,
ça leur fera perdre notre trace.
Ca sera froid.
Mais ça nous tiendra éveillé.
Après 1km nous...
retournerons sur nos pas vers l'ouest.
Droit vers l'autoroute.
Ca parait facile quand tu le dis.
Nous pouvons le faire.
Nous allons le faire, n'est ce pas ?
Fais la taire.
Elle va les mener droit vers nous.
Est ce que le nom "Gene Pecusa" te dit quelque chose ?
Oui, revenant 927.
Oh, laisse moi deviner.
Il a toujours la capacité
de transformer 20 dollars en formidable gueule de bois.
Et une nuit en cellule de dégrisement.
Allez, nous devons le ramener chez lui.
Laisse ça à Mortimer et Falcone.
Nous avons autre chose à faire ?
Non.
Tout est calme à Abendson.
Personne n'est autorisé à approcher de la tour.
C'est bien ça le problème, tu ne crois pas ?
Tom... Tom, non.
Tu te souviens
que Jarvis a encore ta lettre de démission.
Elle veut des résultats.
Je vais lui en donner.
En plus, tu veux savoir autant que moi ce que c’est que ce truc.
J'essaye de ne pas y penser.
Oui, eh bien, je ne peux pas penser à autre chose.
Donc il semblerait que Tess ait pris possession de toi.
Je n'ai pas une envie irrésistible de prendre une trousse à outils.
Je viens avec toi.
Tout va bien, Tess.
Nous vous ramenons à Abendson.
On a signé votre sortie, Tess.
Personne du NTAC ne vous+ poursuivra.
Pas vous. Les docteurs dans les sous-marins.
Ils nous observent.
Allez, quoi, tu as des remords ?
Non, entrons.
Donc, tu me dois toujours …
4 ou 5 dollars pour ces
2 packs ? Quelque chose comme ça ?
J'en ai 20 avec moi,
Si tu penses que tu peux me les prendre.
Regarde toi, vieux.
De retour parmi les vivants. Tu as l'air bien.
Je marche. Je parle.
J'ai le contrôle total de mes membres.
Tu tapes toujours comme une fille.
Rien n'a changé.
4 ans ? Plein de choses ont changées.
De quoi tu parles ?
On s'est vus juste quand tu es sorti de l'hôpital.
Je ne me souviens de rien.
De rien ?
Donc tu ne te souviens pas t'être assis à poil
au milieu des arroseurs ?
Non.
Ca ressemble plus à quelque chose que toi tu ferais.
Et bien...
Merci.
Je n'ai jamais eu la chance de le dire.
Pour m'avoir sorti du coma... Merci
Tu sais, si ça n'avait pas été pour moi,
tu n'aurais jamais été
dans ce stupide hôpital de toutes façons, alors...
Non, j'aurais été celui de nous deux qui aurait disparu dans la colo des 4400.
Je serais peut-être revenu avec les mains magiques.
C'est bon, c'est bon. Ok.
En parlant de disparition, espèce de débile...
Kyle, ne reviens pas là dessus.
Ne reviens pas là dessus ? Ta mère est complètement flippée.
Tu ne l'as pas vue depuis 1 an. Tu n'as vu personne.
Ton frère. Mon père.
Qu'est ce qui s'est passé avec Nikki ?
Kyle, j'ai pas envie de parler de Nikki.
On s'inquiète tous beaucoup pour toi, mec.
Vous n'avez pas besoin de l'être. Je veux dire...
Je vais bien.
Je suis allé là où tu vis.
Il y a de sérieuses ondes négatives style La Firme, tu t'en rends compte, n'est-ce pas ?
Toutes ces conneries à propos de "révéler le 4400 qui est en chacun de nous..."
Et alors ?
Tu ne crois pas vraiment que Collier peut faire ça, si ?
Kyle...
Regarde autour de nous, mon pote.
Le monde est en chute libre.
Ces centres,
c'est le moyen pour rapprocher les gens, peut-être notre dernière chance.
Non seulement je crois qu'il peut le faire,
mais en plus je crois que c'est sa mission.
On dirait qu'on t'a fait un lavage de cerveau.
Il m'avait dit que tu ne comprendrais pas.
Collier ?
Oui.
Tu sais quoi ? Il avait raison.
Isabelle...
Richard !
Mon Dieu. Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Je suppose que je ne regardais pas où j'allais.
Ok. On a juste besoin de se reposer.
Tu penses que eux, ils font des pauses ?
S'il te plait, Richard.
D'accord.
5 minutes.
Ok, tout le monde, allez !
Tout le monde sort et se dirige vers la tour.
Allez.
On a beaucoup de travail, et pas beaucoup de temps, alors on y va, allez.
Allez, allez.
Allez, vous entendez ? Allons-y.
Celui là c'est pour moi. Restez dehors.
Hé, Kevin !
Regarde. Je me suis échappée.
Tu penses toujours à moi.
Kevin est un génie, vous savez,
mais il ne s'en vante pas.
Je parie que dans quelques jours, ces baies seront mûres.
Ne les manges pas maintenant.
La dernière chose dont on ait besoin, c'est d'avoir des crampes d'estomac.
Regarde.
Je croyais que tu avais dit qu'elles n'étaient pas mûres.
Elles ne l'étaient pas.
Eh bien...
C'est Isabelle ?
Sûrement.
Tu nous encourages, fillette.
Ils vont devoir travailler vite.
Je vais les aider.
C'est pas drôle, Diana.
Il faut vraiment que je le fasse.
Non, tu ne ferais que les gêner.
Tu ne comprends pas. J'ai vraiment besoin de le faire.
Faites envoyer ça chez moi.
Shawn, je te cherchais.
Ouais, je suis allé faire un tour.
Nous avons une visite particulière, ce soir.
Elle a un cancer du pancréas. Son mari
va nous faire don d'un immeuble pour un Centre 4400 à Los Angeles.
Ben, ce soir ça ne va pas être possible pour moi, Jordan.
Eh bien, tu as 5... non, 6 heures pour te mettre de bonne humeur.
L'humeur n'a rien à voir là dedans.
Je ne travaille pas ce soir, c'est tout.
Richard,
s'il te plait. Ne fais pas ça.
On a pas le choix.
Ils sont 3.
Ils vont te tuer.
Pas si j'arrive à mettre la main sur un de leurs fusils.
Tu peux à peine marcher.
C'est notre seule chance.
Je dois le faire maintenant, tant que j'en ai encore la force.
Si je ne suis pas revenu au coucher du soleil,
prends le bébé et marche tout droit vers l'ouest.
C'est par là.
Prends garde à bien suivre une ligne droite.
Compris ?
Je donnerais encore 50 ans si c'était pour te retrouver à nouveau.
Vous le saviez, n'est-ce pas ?
Savoir quoi ?
Que Baldwin et Skouris ont sorti Tess Doerner d'ici pour la ramener à Abendson.
Ils reconstruisent la tour.
Ce serait une théorie.
Ne pleures pas.
Tu ne peux pas pleurer maintenant.
Lâche ça.
Sinon je te coupe en 2.
Voilà...
Tourne-toi.
Je vous ai mieux éduqués que ça.
Lève-toi !
Diana,
où est-ce que ça en est ?
Eh bien, on dirait qu'elle est en meilleur état que je ne l'aurais pensé.
Le feu a épargné la plupart du câblage.
Donc combien de temps avant que ce soit prêt ?
Il faut qu'on finisse de trianguler les paraboles, et c'est bon.
Alors faites-le.
Baldwin.
Nous avons votre mari !
Soit vous sortez,
soit le prochain son que vous entendrez sera celui de votre mari allant
tout droit en enfer !
Je vous l'ai dit, elle est à des kilomètres...
Ouvre encore une fois la bouche, et je te coupe la langue.
Ok...
Surveille le.
Lily ! Cours !
Tu es sur de ne pas vouloir me dire au revoir ?
C'est surtout toi qui va me manquer.
Pour la dernière fois, Baldwin, ouvrez cette porte.
Je peux pas faire ça.
Vous aviez dit vouloir des résultats.
Ecoutez-moi Baldwin, vous n'êtes pas dans votre état normal.
Et ce ne sont pas les résultats dont je voulais parler.
Maintenant, reculez-vous avant d'être blessé.
Allez-y.
Non, non, attendez, attendez !
Je vous en prie, attendez.
Nous avons besoin des réponses que cette tour pourrait nous fournir.
Ecoutez-moi, je vous en prie...
Il y a un risque, je le sais.
Mais parfois, pour trouver la vérité, il faut avoir la foi...
je vous en prie écoutez-moi.
Hmmm.
Vous voulez la vérité ?
Les souvenirs du futur de Tess Doerner...
Ce ne sont pas des souvenirs.
Elle a lu la nouvelle de H. P. Lovecraft.
"The Shadow Out of Time", je l'ai avec moi.
J'ai souligné les passages qui apparaissent
mot pour mot dans ton rapport.
Encore une hallucination.
Non.
Je suis désolé Tom.
OK, allons-y. Mes hommes s'en occupent.
Que tout le monde s'éloigne de cette tour.
Isabelle...
Isabelle...
Mon fils ! Qu'est ce que vous m'avez fait faire ?
Mon Dieu, Gabriel... mon fils !
Richard !
Je n'ai pas fait ça !
Cette créature... m'a fait presser la détente.
Vous avez relâché le diable sur cette terre !
Et nous allons tous être réduits en cendre !
Richard !
Où êtes-vous ?
Où êtes-vous ?
Faisons rentrer tout le monde dans leur chambre.
On va avoir besoin de faire l'appel
avant la prochaine tournée de soins.
Où êtes-vous ?
J'ai fait ce que vous vouliez, non ?
Parlez-moi.
Allons, Tess.
Nous devrions prendre un peu de repos.
Mais ils m'ont mentie.
Ou alors c'est moi qui vous ai menti ?
Quelque part, j'en aurais voulu davantage.
Je ne sais pas ce que j'attendais.
Une autre boule de lumière,
une voix retentissante venant du ciel... enfin, quelque chose.
Est-ce qu'on a pu faire une erreur de construction ?
Peut-être.
Tout ce que je sais, c'est que
je n'ai plus envie de tenir un marteau, et il y a 10 minutes,
c'est tout ce à quoi je pouvais penser.
- Oui...
- Ok.
Le NORAD affirme que l'impulsion s'est dissipée avant de quitter l'atmosphère.
Tout ce bruit et cette fureur pour rien ?
Notre priorité à présent est d'aider le personnel à remettre de l'ordre ici.
Ok ? Et je veux que tout ceux d'entre vous qui ont été infectés par cette chose soit examinés par un médecin du NTAC.
Vous m'incluez dans cet ordre ? Parce que je ne suis pas sûr que...
Vous avez été infecté,
parce que si vous restez là à me dire que vous ne l'avez pas été,
je mets une date sur votre lettre de démission.
J'ai vraiment été infecté.
C'est bien ce que je pensais.
On ne refuserait pas un peu d'aide pour mettre de l'ordre dans cette zone,
et on doit se débarrasser de ces outils avant qu'un patient ne se blesse.
Vous l'avez entendu ?
Excusez-moi, Dr. Clayton ?
Kevin...
Est-ce que vous venez de me parler ?
Je crois que oui.
Je n'ai pas
prononcé un mot depuis longtemps, n'est-ce pas ?
Voilà 6 ans que vous essayez.
Je peux aussi penser à nouveau.
Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est produit,
mais...
je me sens...
mieux.
Vous m'avez fait suivre ?
J'aurais même pu faire enregistrer ta conversation.
Mais j'ai pensé que ce serait aller trop loin.
Bon Dieu, Kyle a raison. Je suis une sorte de prisonnier.
Je te l'ai dit, Shawn, tu peux quitter cet endroit quand tu veux.
Et je le pensais,
mais jusqu'à ce que tu le fasses,
je ne permettrai pas à ces ombres du passé d'altérer ton avis
sur ce que nous essayons d'accomplir ici. Tu es trop important.
Non, non, vous avez juste besoin de moi pour encaisser de gros chèques.
Shawn, l'argent...
est un moyen d'arriver à nos fins.
C'est le but qui est important.
Assurer le futur.
Sauver...
la planète.
Je ne peux pas y arriver sans toi.
Vous voulez une preuve que le futur fonctionne de bien étrange façon ?
Ne cherchez pas plus loin que M. Kevin Burkhoff.
Ouais, au lieu de contacter le futur, on l'a eu, lui.
Il s'avère que ce n'est pas aussi décevant que ça en a l'air au premier regard.
Burkhoff était titulaire d'une chaire de neurochimie à l'Université de Stanford.
La neuroscience.
La seule matière où j'ai eu un B.
Oui, tu n'es pas la seule.
Seule une poignée de gens sont au top d'une discipline sur une période donnée.
Notre M. Burkhoff était l'hériter désigné,
jusqu'à ce qu'il souffre de ses premières hallucinations à l'âge de 30 ans,
et qu'il soit interné 2 ans plus tard.
Sur quoi travaillait-il ?
Vous voulez un effet domino ?
Que dites-vous de ça :
Burkhoff
spécialisé dans les capacités latentes du cerveau.
Il essayait de réveiller des parties du cerveau que nous ne pouvons pas utiliser.
Des parties capables de faire quoi ?
Eh bien, des parties qui pourraient amener à toutes sortes de nouvelles capacités, comme...
la prémonition.
Exact, Marco ?
Prémonition, télékinésie,
Arrêtez-moi si ça vous semble familier.
Maia Rutledge.
Orson Bailey.
Vous êtes en train de dire que Burkhoff est le père de la technologie des 4400 ?
C'est possible.
Et l'on vient de le réveiller.
Madame Oster, de l'appartement d'à côté, va avoir un chaton.
J'espère qu'elle me laissera jouer avec lui en dépit du fait qu'un livre va sortir sur la façon dont...
... moi et Diana on va former une vraie famille...
... un ordinateur pour Noël...
...
... les chefs de maman...
Les chefs de maman seront punis pour nous avoir trahis.
Les chefs de maman seront punis pour nous avoir trahis.

Précédemment dans "The 4400"…
Nous ne sommes pas sûrs de ce qui arrive.
La lumière a disparue,
laissant place à des milliers de personnes.
- On les laisse partir.
- On les laisse partir ?
On n’a aucun droit de les retenir.
Vous êtes enceinte ?
Je n'étais pas enceinte
quand j'ai été enlevée,
mais je l'étais à mon retour.
- C'est quoi tout ça ?
- A quoi ça ressemble, d'après vous ?
Ce bébé pourrait être la clé de notre futur,
et il doit être protégé,
et je peux le faire.
C'est ça, fuyez !
Ce bébé m'appartient.
C'est ta nouvelle maison ?
C'est la tienne aussi.
J'ai attendu ce moment
pendant si longtemps.
Diana Skouris, votre adoption
de Maia Rutledge est par ceci effective,
officielle et définitive.
Ses visions ont cessé il y a environ 4 mois.
On ne sait pas vraiment pourquoi.
Mme Usher, de l'appartement d'à côté,
va avoir un chaton.
Les chefs de maman seront punis
pour nous avoir trahis.
Ce n'était pas moi !
Cette créature m'a fait
presser la détente !
Tu commences à t'habiller
par le casque, maintenant ?
C'est comme ça qu'ils font
chez les Mariners ?
Les Mariners ?
Gary a plutôt des vues sur les Sox.
Tu veux dire que les Sox
ont des vues sur lui.
Comment tu te sens,
avec ces recruteurs dans les gradins ?
Tu te penches pour refaire tes lacets,
ils prennent des notes.
Et si tu lui montrais
un peu de respect ?
Tu es en présence
du nouveau Jackie Robinson.
Le premier 4400 à entrer
en ligue nationale.
T'inquiète pas à propos
des recruteurs, mec.
Je te ferai des passes bien au centre.
Prends bien ton rythme,
et oublie même qu'ils sont là, d'accord ?
<i>On peut pas lui en vouloir.
Six recruteurs.</i>
<i>Moi j'aurais tellement la trouille
que j'étoufferais.</i>
Je n'étoufferai pas.
<i>Ca commence aujourd'hui.</i>
<i>... La justice a un sens...</i>
<i>... Négro !...</i>
<i>... Impossible ! Impossible !...</i>
Barnes ne peut pas
mieux servir que ça.
Donne moi juste une seconde.
<i>Il lui lance une balle molle.</i>
<i>Il a peur.</i>
<i>C'était quoi le problème
avec celle-là ?</i>
<i>Quel loser.</i>
<i>Va jusqu'au bout.
Va jusqu'au bout.</i>
<i>Cette fois, essaye de sortir
la batte de tes épaules.</i>
Ca te dirait de tâter de ma batte ?
C'est quoi ton problème, Gary ?
Navarro ! Remets-toi dans le jeu.
Concentre toi.
Je veux voir du contact.
<i>La Ligue Nationale ?</i>
<i>Ce gamin n'a même pas l'air d'être prêt
pour des balles de débutants.</i>
Ferme la !
Est-ce que tout le monde
va se la fermer...
que je puisse me concentrer ?
Whoa, Gary...
Prends le un cran en dessous.
<i>T'es un cas, toi, hein ?
Vas-y. Frappe-moi.</i>
Je resterai là planté devant toi.
Je ne vais pas te frapper !
Qui a parlé de frapper, mec ?
Ca suffit, Navarro.
T'as fini pour la journée.
Je veux te voir dans mon bureau
après l'entraînement.
Je n'ai aucun problème.
Je n'ai aucun problème.
Continue de marcher, mon vieux.
Je n'ai aucun problème !
Continue de marcher, mon vieux.
Tout de suite.
- Détends-toi.
- Ne me touche pas !
<i>Ce gamin n'est pas prêt.</i>
<i>C'était une sacrée perte de temps.</i>
<i>...qu'il aille à la douche...</i>
<i>Prêt pour la Ligue Nationale, mon cul.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce qui n'allait pas ?</i>
Fermez-la !
Fermez-la !
Vous allez la fermer !
Vous allez la fermer !
Fermez-la !
Je n'ai aucun problème !
Je n'ai aucun problème !
Eh bien, cet endroit est mieux
qu’un fossé dans les bois.
Pas de beaucoup.
C'est juste pour un jour ou deux,
pour laisser Isabelle se reposer, ensuite,
on finira le reste de la route.
On a assez pour arriver
jusqu'à White Bird ?
Avec une nouvelle voiture,
un voyage aux urgences...
ça va être juste.
Fuir et se cacher tout le temps,
parfois j'oublie
qu'on n'a rien fait de mal.
Il y a 3 homes morts dans les bois
qui te contrediraient.
Tu veux aller te doucher en premier,
ou je peux y aller ?
Vas-y d'abord.
Tu donnes le biberon à Isabelle, d'accord ?
D 'accord.
C'était toi, n'est-ce pas ?
C'est  toi qui as arrêté
ces hommes dans les bois ?
Hein ?
Papa  aimerait bien savoir.
Mais tu ne vas rien me dire,
n'est-ce pas ?
ce qui te fait rire ?
Marmaduke.
On peut avoir un chien ?
Oh, habile, la façon dont tu glisses ça
dans la conversation.
Non.
Skouris.
April.
Wahou !
Non, non, non. Je suis...
ravie d'avoir de tes nouvelles.
Tu es ma soeur.
C'est juste que...
ça fait un bail, c'est tout.
Non, on est ici,
on prend le petit-déjeuner.
Reste en ligne une seconde.
Mme Lannox a dû oublier ses clefs.
J'y vais.
Non, non, non, je m'en occupe.
Continue de manger.
Je dois faire entrer
la maîtresse de Maia.
J'arrive !
Encore une seconde.
Surprise ?
April...
Comment tu vas, soeurette ?
Bien.
Tu as l'air en forme.
Oui, toi aussi.
Merci.
ce que tu fais ici ?
L'expo d'art corporel
de la Pacific Northwest.
J'ai un stand.
Ne me dis pas que tu n'as pas
encore pris tes tickets ?
Euh... non.
Bonjour.
Oh mon dieu, tu dois être Maia.
April Skouris, le mouton noir de la famille.
Di', tu as tellement de chance.
Regarde moi cette jolie
petite fille que tu as.
Et pas d'accouchement,
pas de vergetures,
pas de couches...
pas de mari emmerdant.
Oh attends,
Ca c'était moi.
Comment ça se fait que je ne t'ai
jamais rencontrée avant ?
- C'est compliqué.
- On a été très occupées.
Ok, tenons-nous en à "occupées".
Peu importe.
Je suis là maintenant.
Où est-ce que tu es descendue
pour ton séjour ici ?
Le canapé a l'air confortable.
Ce n’est pas une exécution, Shawn.
La dernière fois que
je suis monté sur scène,
c'était en CM1 pour
un concours d'orthographe.
Nous intéressons ces gens.
Ils veulent écouter ce qu'on a à dire.
Tu trouveras bien quelque chose.
Bonsoir.
Je m'appelle Shawn Farrell,
et je suis un des 4400.
Wahou, euh...
il y a quelques mois, je n'aurais jamais cru
que quelqu'un applaudirait sur ces paroles.
Mais on ne savait pas alors,
ce que nous savons maintenant.
L'avenir de l'humanité est en danger,
et c'est ici,
avec votre aide,
que nous allons commencer
à remettre les choses en ordre.
Si vous nous rejoignez...
M. Collier,
M. Dravitt est ici pour vous voir.
Merci.
... la meilleure partie de vous-même.
Ian.
Merci de me recevoir.
Voilà un endroit intéressant.
Je ne vais pas être enlevé
par des aliens, n'est-ce pas ?
Non, Ian.
Ce n'était pas des aliens.
- Ils venaient du futur.
- Je sais. Vous me l'avez répété
jusqu’à la nausée. Ecoutez, tout ça
n'est que du divertissement pour moi.
Donc,
me voilà ici. Et vous voilà.
Et si on retournait à nos affaires ?
Ian Dravitt.
Fondateur et PDG d'Executive Projections,
une multinationale basée au Zimbabwe.
Si votre société veut faire des affaires
avec un pays du tiers-monde,
ils vous montrent les ficelles.
Tout ceci est parfaitement légal.
Oui, à première vue,
mais la véritable fortune
de Dravitt vient
d'activités mercenaires
et du trafic d'armes.
Il a vendu à l'I. R. A des lance grenades,
et des mines au phosphore blanc
aux guérilleros du Chemin Lumineux au Pérou.
Alors qu'est-ce qu'il vend à Collier ?
Bonne question,
mais notre équipe de surveillance
n'arrive même pas à dire
à quelle heure Collier déjeune.
Au-delà du lobby,
cet endroit est un mystère.
Je veux dire, on a envoyé nos agents
déguisés en installateurs de climatisation,
en réparateurs de fibre optique...
Oui, quand on installe un micro,
il est arraché avant la fin de la journée.
Ils sondent sûrement le bâtiment
toutes les deux ou trois heures.
Aussi longtemps que Collier
ne fait que rencontrer Dravitt...
tout ce que nous pouvons faire,
c'est deviner.
Vous pensez qu'il stocke des armes ?
Des armes, de l'anthrax,
rien ne me surprendrait.
Collier ne fait que clamer qu'il est
en guerre contre le gouvernement américain.
Il pourrait être en train d'établir
un périmètre de défense autour du Centre.
Comme ça, si jamais on avait
à se rendre là-bas, il serait prêt.
Pense au suicide collectif de Waco.
A celui de Jonestown.
Jarvis.
Je les envoie là-bas.
M. Navarro ? Je suis l'agent Skouris,
et voici l'agent Tom...
S'il vous plaît...
Je vous en prie ne parlez pas.
Il y a trop de bruit.
Vos voix et vos pensées, elles sont
comme diffusées en même temps.
Le rapport des urgences dit
que vous parlez sans cesse de...
Aucune parole.
Concentrez-vous sur ce
que vous voulez me demander,
et je vous entendrai.
Il y a quelques semaines.
C'était pendant un match.
Je pouvais entendre
les pensées de tout le monde.
Au début, c'était juste le lanceur,
ce qui m'arrangeait bien, en fait...
puisque je savais à l'avance
ce qu'il allait lancer avant qu'il lance.
J'ai marqué 5 points sur 5.
Deux home-runs,
deux simples et un double.
- C'est exactement...
- Chut...
Oui,
oui, c'était super
quand ça a commencé.
Mais je ne peux pas le contrôler.
D'abord, c'était toute l'équipe, ensuite
tout le gradin, et après,
je sais pas, c'était...
tout le monde.
c'est comme un océan de bruit qui vient
percuter l'intérieur de ma tête.
Je veux que quelqu'un fasse
en sorte que ça s'en aille.
C'est ça que je veux.
J'étais tellement près...
d'arriver à rentrer en Ligue Nationale
quand ça m'a pris.
Cette fois je vais y arriver.
Je dois y arriver.
Alors quoi, Navarro arrive vraiment
à lire dans les pensées ?
Je crois que le mot que vous
cherchez, c'est "télépathe"
Eh bien, appelez-le autrement
si ça vous rend mal à l'aise,
mais cet homme savait vraiment
à quoi on pensait.
Hmmm, quel don intéressant.
J'arriverais à imaginer quelques
applications pratiques pour ça.
Le Dr. Ostman lui a donné
de l'Halopéridol.
Ca l'a calmé,
et apaisé un peu le bruit.
Il peut vivre aussi longtemps
qu'il est sous antipsychotiques ?
On  n'aura pas à lui faire essayer
une camisole de force,
mais il ne va pas pouvoir non plus
frapper des balles de base-ball, ce qui est
son seul désir.
D'accord, je vais mettre l'équipe
médicale du NTAC là dessus.
S'ils peuvent aider, ils le feront.
Super.
- Kyle Baldwin.
- Numéro de sécurité sociale ?
Le voilà.
Baldwin...
Rien.
Vous n'avez pas le droit de vous inscrire.
Mais si, je l'ai reçu le semestre dernier.
J'ai eu une dérogation.
Votre tuteur n'a pas été payé.
Quoi ? Mon père a envoyé un chèque.
Non.
Paiement effectué par : aucun paiement.
Baldwin.
Heureux de vous avoir.
J'ai la demande de transfert
pour Navarro. Vous signez,
et il sera soigné par le NTAC.
Ouais, je le ferais,
mais pas encore.
Pourquoi pas ?
Bien, on veut savoir
ce que Collier et Ian Dravitt font.
Un 4400 qui peut lire dans les pensées
nous le dira.
Vous voulez utiliser Navarro
comme une taupe ?
Est-ce même légal ?
D. C. l'a autorisé.
Et l'étique ?
Ce type nous a demandé de l'aide.
Il nous supplie, bon sang.
On l'aidera.
Mais il nous aidera d'abord.
Et s'il dit non ?
Vous lui ferez dire oui.
Pardon.
On peut avoir une autre couverture ?
Celles qu'on a sont plutôt minces.
Oui, elles sont plutôt minces, mais
si vous voulez la ramener,
je vous l'échangerais.
Je crois qu'on aura besoin des deux.
Vous pensez en avoir besoin,
mais vous ne les aurez pas.
Il y a autant de couvertures
que de chambres.
Et vous avez les vôtres.
Mon bébé a froid.
Je peux avoir une autre couverture,
s'il vous plait, pour
qu'elle ne tombe pas malade ?
Je vous donne 5 dollars.
Je  suis bonne poire
pour un joli minois.
Il n’était pas très sympa, hein ?
Voilà.
Merci.
Et s'ils m'attrapent ?
On vous suivra pas à pas.
On implante un petit émetteur-transmetteur
dans votre oreille
sous la peau
ça prend 10 minutes,
pas de traces.
Si les choses tournent mal,
on arrive comme la cavalerie.
Quand j'étais môme, heu
Ma série favorite était
”Des agents très spéciaux”
30 ans en arrière d'un coup.
Mon petit frère prend sa retraite
de la police de Tacoma en fin d'année.
Il a 53 ans.
Les types avec qui je jouais  ?
Ceux qui ont réussi
à devenir professionnels...
Signent des autographes
dans des spectacles...
Jouer, c'est tout ce que j'ai.
J'avais compris.
Vous avez joué ?
En dernière année de fac, je me suis
démis le genou en glissant sur une marque.
Quelle position ?
3ème base.
Une autre infidélité ?
Ça vous manque ?
Tout le temps.
Mais ce qu'on fait ici,
Gary, ce qu'on vous demande...
C'est...
Ce n’est pas le mondial,
mais c'est...
c'est important.
Je fais ça pour vous...
Vous allez me soigner ?
Vous avez ma parole.
Ok.
Désolé d'avoir manqué le dîner.
Un nouveau cas.
Je suis content que
tu n’aies pas attendu.
C'est pour ça que tu es désolé ?
Le dîner ?
Demande moi comment était
ma première journée de fac ?
Comment était
ta première journée de fac ?
Je ne l'ai pas eue.
Personne n'a payé mes droits.
De quoi tu parles,
bien sûr que si, c'est ridicule.
J'ai essayé de t'appeler un paquet de fois,
mais tu ne répondais pas.
J'étais en réunion toute la journée,
mais j'ai fait ce chèque.
C'est super, papa.
Désolé, Kyle, j'ai dû oublier.
On  en a parlé des mois,
comment as-tu pu oublier ?
Voilà, amène le demain,
j'écris un mot.
Où je parlerais à l'admission,
ce que tu veux.
Voilà.
Kyle ! Ne t'en vas pas.
Juste... Ecoute.
Je l'admets.
Je ne le nie pas, j'ai merdé,
mais le boulot me rend cinglé...
Le boulot ?
Je l'attendais celle-la.
C'est comme avant, finalement.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Lily ?
C'est quoi ?
Tu as...
dépensé tout l'argent pour ça ?
Quoi ?
Parle moi.
La caisse enregistreuse du Motel...
était ouverte...
Et on avait besoin de nourriture.
Et Isabelle a besoin de couches
Tu as volé de l'argent ?
C’est pas comme si je l’avais prémédité,
mais j'ai du supplier
pour une couverture.
Et la caisse était ouverte, alors...
Il est parti en te laissant
avec la caisse ouverte ?
Il l'avait fermé, je pense,
je ne sais plus...
C'était fermé et puis...
et puis c'était ouvert.
C'est quand même du vol !
Je ne veux pas vivre comme ça.
Regarde autour de toi ?
Je n'avais pas prévu
de vivre comme ça non plus.
Je sais que c'était mal.
Ce n'est pas la peine de me le répéter.
Arrête de secouer la tête.
Mange un peu, d'accord ?
Ça serait stupide de gâcher
toute cette nourriture.
Commence.
Je n'ai pas faim.
Ce n’était pas super ?
J'ai aimé, merci.
Vous étiez où,
le mot disait juste "sorties".
Plein d'endroit, l'embarcadère,
le périph', et même le ferry.
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait...
Non !
Je t'avais dit qu'elle aurait peur !
Calme toi, c'est des décalcos.
C’est des "faux".
Mais ils sont chouettes, hein ?
Très chouettes.
Pourquoi tu ne vas pas
faire tes devoirs ?
Je suis préoccupée.
Tu aimes au moins le T-shirt ?
Et au fait...
Tu vis à Seattle et tes enfants
ne savent pas qui est Kurt Cobain ?
Quel est ton problème, Di ?
Mais dieu merci, tu lui parles des tatouages
et des rocks stars suicidaires.
Et au fait,
qui t'a donné la permission
de lui faire manquer l'école ?
Je suis sa tante.
Je ne pensais pas en avoir besoin.
Si tu renvoies sa prof pour la journée, oui.
Assise à la table de la cuisine
toute la journée ?
C'est une grande perte.
De quoi tu protèges cette gosse ?
Si j'avais besoin de ton opinion
pour élever ma fille, je te le dirais.
Maman ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, mon coeur ?
Je crois que je vais vomir.
Elle a mangé quoi ?
Tout ce qu'elle voulait.
Oh.
Bien vu, tante April.
Ok, les gars, j'entre.
Collier va vouloir te rencontrer
si tu es un des 4400.
Tout ce que tu pourras apprendre
sur lui est utile,
mais l'objectif principal est Ian Dravitt.
Vois ce que tu peux apprendre sur lui.
Pourquoi il est là.
Tu as pour 2 semaines d'Halopéridol.
Tu garderas l'esprit clair, mais si tout
va bien tu seras sorti dans quelques jours.
Pardon.
<i>Mignon. Jolies chaussures.</i>
<i>Le tenir éloigné des brochures.</i>
Bienvenue au centre.
Je m'appelle Devon.
Je suis Gary Navarro.
Je suis plutôt intéressé
par ce que vous faites ici.
Je serais ravie de vous faire visiter.
Vous avez lu le livre de Mr. Collier ?
Pas besoin, je l'ai vécu.
Je suis un des 4400.
Alors, bienvenue chez vous.
Gary Navarro,
Jordan Collier.
Je suis ravi de vous rencontrer.
C'est une poignée de main ferme.
Je ne m'attendais pas à moins,
d'un joueur de deuxième base.
Comment le saviez-vous ?
C'est mon métier
de tout savoir sur les 4400.
Donc...
Vous avez trouvé quelque chose ?
Une capacité ou...
Non, pas moi,
Je passe déjà pas mal de temps
à taper une balle rapide.
C'est frustrant, non ?
Toutes ces années perdues ?
<i>Pas de capacités. Le repasser à Devon.
Revenir à Dravitt.</i>
Jordan, nous devons parler.
Absolument, Shawn.
Mais avant, je te présente
un de nos revenants,
Gary Navarro, Shawn Farrell.
- Bonjour.
- Comment allez-vous ?
Shawn est plus chanceux
que vous et moi.
Il est revenu
avec une aptitude incroyable.
Je suis béni, c'est bon,
voyez l'auréole autour de ma tête.
Je dois vraiment te parler.
Donnez nous une seconde.
J'ai fais des recherches sur Internet.
J’ai trouvé des trucs que vous avez besoin
de savoir, parce que, laissez moi vous dire
j'espère vraiment que vous les ignorez.
Si ça peut être trouvé par un moteur
de recherche, je le sais déjà.
Vous êtes bien avec ce Dravitt ?
Les yeux sur la récompense,
tu t'en souviens ?
Faire des affaires avec des amis,
n'en fais pas des amis.
<i>Dravitt n'est pas mon ami,
c'est un dangereux taré.</i>
Je te retrouve dehors dans 10 minutes,
le temps que Gary s'installe.
On va en parler.
C'est reparti.
Bonjour ?
Bonjour ?
Vous allez bien ?
C'est quoi ?
Très lointain, je pense.
Premier jour et déjà déconnecté ?
Juste perdu, et en retard.
A demander ma route pour des classes
où je n’ai même pas envie d’aller.
Pas un très bon jour, alors.
"Introduction sur les nouvelles du 19ème."
Achevez moi.
Peut-être que ça va vous intéresser,
plus que vous ne l'imaginiez.
Rien de tel, c'était le seul module
disponible sur cette période.
Bien, c'est la salle Olin.
Prenez les escaliers à votre gauche.
Merci.
Peut-être à plus tard.
On ne sait jamais.
Bonjour tout le monde,
je suis Wendy Paulson
Bienvenue à l'introduction
sur les nouvelles du 19ème.
Tout le monde est dans le bon cours ?
Je vous parlerai après les cours.
Je n'entends rien,
je vais m'approcher.
Gary, vous faites quoi ?
Collier et ce gamin, votre neveu,
Je pense qu'ils discutent de Dravitt.
Où êtes vous ?
Gary, rentrez à l'intérieur.
Une bonne vue ?
Je suis juste...
On ne devrait pas le récupérer ?
Non, pas encore.
Il peut peut-être en apprendre plus.
Que faites-vous ?
Lâchez le.
Soyez plus attentif à ceux que vous
laissez entrer dans votre manoir, fiston.
Nous avons arrêté cet homme,
par politesse...
Jordan,
Ce sont des malfrats.
Pas besoin de nous nommer.
On a mis la main sur ce type
en train de vous espionner.
J'ai des questions pour vous, c'est tout.
J'ai vu que vous vous disputiez,
je devais faire quoi,
vous interrompre ?
Vous voulez savoir de quoi nous parlions ?
Parce que ce n'est pas un grand secret.
Je vais vous dire,
- ... précisément nous parlions...
- Shawn, c'est assez...
Vous allez trouver que je suis
tout le temps trés occupé Gary,
Si vous avez des questions,
n'importe qui de mon personnel...
sera heureux de vous aider
Oui, désolé,
la prochaine fois je le saurai.
Très bien.
Retournez à l'intérieur.
<i>Il faut faire attention où il traîne.</i>
<i>Personne ne se mettra
entre moi et 30 millions de dollars.</i>
Richard ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Les flics.
Oh, mon dieu.
Je suis désolée.
Je leur dirai que c'est moi
qui ait pris l'argent.
Tu n'as rien à voir avec ça.
Police, ouvrez !
Donnez nous une minute !
Ouvrez. Maintenant !
Ils ne sont pas après nous.
Allez !
C'est bon.
Les mecs ? Vous êtes là ?
Allez-y, Gary
Oui, désolé d'avoir coupé
le contact aussi longtemps.
Ils m'ont mis en classe toute la matinée.
Je n'ai pas vu Collier de toute la journée
ou cet autre type.
Bien, c'est bon.
Vous êtes allé où ils vous ont dit d'aller.
Oui, mais je pensais que vous aviez dit que
vous vouliez en savoir plus à propos
de l'argent que Collier a allongé ?
Où sont mes médicaments ?
Gary, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Mes médicaments, ils ont disparus.
Je n'ai pas…
Laissez moi vous montrer
Ok, ça sera bien.
Heu, excusez moi ?
Je, heu, j'avais une prescription,
quelques tranquillisants dans ma chambre
et maintenant ils ont disparus.
Vous n'en avez pas besoin.
Vous avez été conditionné
pour penser que vous en aviez besoin.
Prendre quelque chose
qui supprime vos dons
est contraire à notre programme.
Peut être devriez vous lire encore
"Purification et Nutrition" jusqu'à la fin.
Vous avez entendu ça, Baldwin ?
Ils ont pris l'halopéridol !
Oui, Gary, J'ai entendu.
Vous voulez arrêter ?
Vous voulez quitter les lieux ?
Tout est seulement, seulement...
plus fort dans ma tête...
Ca empire déjà.
Les voix commencent
à traverser les murs.
Calmez-vous, Gary.
Nous viendrons vous chercher si besoin.
C'est votre appel qui en décidera.
Gary, parlez-moi.
Ok. Hum...
V- V-Vous n'allez pas mettre
fin au deal, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui. Bien sûr.
Ok, ok.
je vais, heu, je vais continuer.
Je me tiendrai tranquille, et je vais tenir
aussi longtemps que possible.
Bien. Nous sommes avec vous.
Maintenant, écoutez, Gary, Quelqu'un sera
à l'écoute 24h/24, vous vous en souviendrez ?
Ok, d'accord.
D'accord.
J'ai, heu,
j'ai lu "le secret partagé"
la nuit dernière.
Comme votre programme le recommande.
C'est un bon début.
Eh bien, pas juste
les 20 premières pages.
Je me suis vraiment mis dedans.
Je l'ai lu entièrement.
Les nouvelles du 19éme siècle, pas forcément
l'enfer auquel vous vous attendiez ?
Ca n'a pas du tout été ennuyeux.
Bien que, j'ai beaucoup de questions.
Ok, d'accord, je serai dans mon bureau
mercredi de 13h à 16h.
Ok, d'accord, j'essayerai de m'y arrêter.
Ou nous pourrions aller au "Coop" et
prendre quelques cafés ?
Maintenant ?
J'aime parler de Joseph Conrad.
C'est pourquoi j'ai choisi ce métier.
Où as-tu appris à faire tout ça ?
Maman ne nous a jamais
appris à cuisiner.
Je ne sais pas.
J'ai seulement appris comment...
être meilleure que toi
pour certaines choses.
Tante April,
est-ce que tu as des enfants ?
Non.
Pas d'enfants.
Tu es mariée ?
Je l'étais. Demande à ta mère
ce qu'elle pensait de mon ex-mari.
Ne commence pas.
Tu ne l'aimais pas ?
Pas plus qu'April apparemment.
Elle est restée avec Trevor
pendant quoi, 7 mois ?
Tu ne l'as pas aimé dès le 1er jour.
Tu ne lui as laissé aucune chance.
Je ne pense pas qu'il méritait une chance.
Il était...
un genre de débile.
Il avait 22 ans.
Montre moi un mec
qui ne soit pas débile à 22 ans.
Il savait que tu le détestais,
Et ça ne nous a pas rendu les choses
plus faciles pour rester ensemble.
Allez. Tu ne peux pas toujours
m'en vouloir pour ça. Je veux dire,
grandit un peu.
Ok, c'était une erreur.
Je pensais que c'était
une bonne idée de venir ici,
mais il est évident que j'avais tort.
Je rassemble mes affaires. Il y a un
petit hôtel juste en haut de la rue.
Non !
C'est bon, chérie,
nous nous verrons toujours...
Mais l'électricité va être coupée cette nuit
et tu n'auras pas de lumière.
De quoi parle-t-elle ?
Puis-je être excusée ?
Mr. Navarro,
quelque chose ne vas pas ?
Ce n'est pas bon.
J'ai besoin de mon halopéridol.
Où est Collier ?
Mr. Collier est à une réunion.
Mr. Navarro ?
Mr. Navarro...
Gary, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Je vais juste parler à Collier.
Ce n'est pas une bonne idée, Gary.
Mr. Navarro...
Il est à une réunion !
Arrêtez ça.
S'il vous plait, arrêtez ça.
Arrêtez ça.
J'ai besoin de mes médicaments.
Peut importe ce qui vous arrive, fiston,
nous l'arrêterons.
Compte dessus.
Un 4400 qui peut lire les pensées ?
Donc vous avez un don.
Vous n'auriez pas dû
me mentir, Gary.
Vous voulez dire...
que ce mec sait ce que je pense ?
Parce que je n'aime personne d'autre
que moi à l'intérieur de ma tête.
Jordan, ce mec est l'un des notre.
Nous ne pouvons pas rester là
et le regarder se faire tuer.
Personne ne tuera personne.
Premièrement, nous devons déterminer
ce que notre homme sait.
Et ensuite, nous discuterons de son sort.
Car il y a des choses que je sais
qui pourraient vous faire tuer !
Qui pourraient tous vous faire tuer.
Appelez Jarvis.
Dites lui qu'on y va.
Ecoutez, Ian…
Fermez la !
Fermez la, maintenant !
Bonjour. Je suis Evan.
Bienvenue dans le centre des 4400.
Le second étage
n'est pas ouvert aux visiteurs.
Nous ne sommes pas des visiteurs.
Hey, mec, regarde, moi aussi j'ai un badge,
et c'est une propriété privée.
Qu'est-ce qu'il lui fait ?
Laissez le,
ou Dieu me vienne en aide,
je ferai gicler vos cervelles
sur tout votre plancher si propre.
Maintenant, s'en est assez.
Jetez cette arme ! Maintenant !
Comment êtes-vous entrés ici ?
Vous ne paraissez pas
si heureux de nous voir.
Eh bien, maintenant.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce bordel ?
Des agents de l'NTAC.
Je n'apprécie pas que le gouvernement
intervienne dans mes affaires.
Vous devriez faire attention
avec qui vous traitez.
Ils n'achètent pas des armes.
Ils projettent un coup d'état à l'étranger,
dans un pays minuscule.
Tu as envoyé un espion ici,
oncle Tommy ?
Beau travail.
Tu as failli nous faire tuer.
Vous aussi, Mr. Dravitt.
Bien, ça sera intéressant de voir
si les accusations de vos amis
tiennent le coup devant un tribunal.
Je suppose que je suis le seul à devoir
faire attention avec qui je fais affaire.
Shawn, tu peux venir avec nous si tu veux.
Super.
Je dirai à ta mère
que tu lui dis bonjour.
Gary,
vous auriez dû venir me voir d'abord.
Je vous aurais bien mieux traité
qu'ils ne le feront jamais.
<i>Nous sommes en guerre ici.</i>
<i>Ne choisit pas le coté perdant.</i>
Regarde ce mignon petit bébé.
Je crois que quelqu'un
veut essayer ton jouet, Walt.
Je pense que vous avez raison.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Tu la remets dans la voiture ?
Pourquoi ?
Maintenant, s'il te plait.
Quel est ton problème ?
Ce petit garçon était gentil avec elle.
Je voulais juste
que personne ne soit blessé.
Blessé ?
Qui aurait été blessé ?
Et si elle n'avait pas voulu
rendre le jouet ?
Qu'est-ce qui se serait passé ?
Ne me regarde pas comme si
tu ne savais pas de quoi je parle.
Ces trois hommes dans les bois...
Ils voulaient nous voir morts.
Tu as vu ce qui leur est arrivé.
C'était Isabelle.
Nous le savons tous les deux,
et ça ne mène à rien
de prétendre le contraire.
Peut importe ce qu'Isabelle fait,
elle le fait par amour pour nous.
Elle est notre fille, Richard.
Je le sais.
Je l'aime tout autant.
Mais elle est autre chose aussi,
et je prie Dieu pour savoir ce que c'est.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Je vais bien.
Alors, quoi ? Donc Collier avait prévu
de dépenser 30 millions de dollars
pour financer des troupes
de mercenaires à Sao Tome ?
Il y a eu 3 coups d'état depuis leur
indépendance en 1974. Mon opinion ?
Collier a tenté d'acheter le quatrième.
Est-ce que Gary a entendu
pourquoi Collier
était si intéressé par cette île
de la côte ouest Africaine ?
Sans ses médicaments, nous sommes
chanceux d'avoir pu en tirer autant.
Oui, mais nous savons ce que Collier pense,
il se tient prêt pour un conflit avec quelqu'un.
Le NTAC, le gouvernement, je ne sais pas.
Il compte placer un gouvernement
amical à Sao Tome.
Cela pourrait être un endroit où aller
quand les choses chaufferont.
Comme quoi,
une terre promise pour les 4400 ?
Malheureusement vous ne pouvez pas
poursuivre quelqu'un
pour des illusions de grandeur.
Ce ne sont pas des illusions
si vous pouvez les réaliser.
Nous avons toujours un train de retard
par rapport à Collier
car nous continuons à le voir
comme une sorte de
gourou.
Ce que nous devrions
nous demander, c'est si...
avant que Collier ne soit enlevé,
il avait déjà ce projet en tête et si...
il est parvenu à le réaliser ?
Ils ne l'ont pas rendu cinglé
dans cette boule de lumière.
Bien, en tout cas, nous voulions
savoir à quoi Collier pensait.
Gary l'a trouvé pour nous.
Il est temps de le ramener
à la section médicale, n'est-ce pas ?
Bientôt.
"Bientôt" ?
La NSA est prévenue, à chaque fois que nous
enregistrons un nouveau don chez un 4400.
Ils ont pensé à D. C., emprunter Garry
pour l'une de leurs opérations.
Non, plus de mission d'espionnage,
il aura juste à être assis à des conférences.
Vous savez comment c'est avec les diplomates
Ils ne disent jamais ce qu'ils pensent.
Ce n'était pas l'arrangement
que j'ai fait avec lui.
Mais les termes ont changé.
Gary est trop précieux.
Je lui ai donné ma parole.
Vous me faites passer pour un menteur.
Vous avez joué le jeu
pendant prés de 20 ans.
Mon opinion c'est que, vous avez vous aussi
commis les sept péchés capitaux,
comme nous tous ici.
J'aurais dû le laisser avec Collier.
Il l'aurait lui aussi utilisé,
mais il l'aurait aussi aidé.
Ne m'utilisez plus jamais.
Tous ce que je voulais
c'était jouer au base-ball.
Vous aviez promis de m'aider, mais
vous ne pouvez pas le faire, n'est-ce pas ?
On s'inquiète à propos des 4400,
il semble de plus en plus
qu'ils devraient s'inquiéter de nous.
Vous connaissez ce bar, Chez Mel ?
Au coin de Lancaster et de la 3éme ?
Tu te joins à moi ?
Nous n'allons pas faire les bars.
Eh bien, j'y vais cette nuit,
avec ou sans toi.

Précédemment dans "The 4400"…
Nous ne sommes pas sûrs de ce qui arrive.
La lumière a disparue,
laissant place à des milliers de personnes.
Tom est le meilleur agent avec lequel j'ai
bossé, peut être le meilleur de la division.
Je pensais être à nouveau sur le terrain.
Vous l'êtes.
C'est effectif immédiatement.
Ca a été de la folie au boulot...
Ah ouais, le boulot.
Je l'attendais, celle-là.
Finalement, rien n'a vraiment changé ici.
April, je suis contente d'avoir
de tes nouvelles. Tu es ma soeur.
Surprise ?
Comment ça se fait que
je ne t'aie jamais vue avant ?
- C'est compliqué.
- On a été très occupées.
Je m'appelle Shawn Farrell.
Je suis l'un des 4400.
Je vous inscris pour une visite ?
Je cherchais mon cousin, Shawn Farrell.
Nos règles m'interdisent de discuter
d'un de nos membres.
Je suis venu te voir.
Il y a des mauvaises ondes du genre
La Firme là bas, tu t'en rends compte, non ?
Ces centres, ils représentent une chance
de réunir les gens.
On dirait qu'on t'a fait
un lavage de cerveau.
Je ne permettrai pas que ces ombres
de ton passé altèrent ton jugement.
C'est le but qui est important.
Assurer l'avenir.
Sauver le monde.
Si Maia a des visions,
tu devrais être au courant,
et tu devrais savoir ce qu'elles disent.
Isabelle a 6 mois.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi elle me parle
et pas à toi.
- Parle ?
- NTAC ? Collier ?
Je ne sais pas de qui il s'agit, mais
quelqu'un sait que nous sommes des 4400.
Fais les bagages.
C'était comment ta journée, papa ?
Pas génial, hein ?
Personne ne veut acheter
du time share a Wilmington dans l'Idaho.
A Baja en Californie, peut-être.
Si j'étais toi, j'irais là bas
et je leur dirais:
"soit vous me donnez les bons
fichiers clients, soit je démissionne".
Tous les commerciaux veulent Baja, chérie.
et je n'ai pas l'ancienneté pour l'avoir.
En quoi est-ce que c'est juste ? Tu es
commercial depuis plus longtemps qu'eux.
Commercial, pas télémarketeur.
C'est différent.
Hé, hé. Appelbaum.
C'est jour de paye.
Laissez-le tranquille !
Il essaye de vous rembourser !
C'est ta bière, Appelbaum ?
Ca te dérange pas si j'étanche ma soif, si ?
Chérie, reste en arrière.
Reste en arrière.
J'ai juste besoin de
quelques semaines de plus.
Je vais me refaire.
Tu sais, dans mon business,
on en entend des histoires larmoyantes,
mais je dois te dire que
la tienne est inédite.
"disparu il y a 15 ans, revenu
dans une boule de lumière, épouse décédée
fille qui a arrêté ses études."
T'as traversé une mauvaise passe,
mais t'as emprunté du fric, et maintenant
tu vas devoir me rembourser.
Je trouverai quelque chose.
Fais le vite, parce que toi et moi,
on en reparlera dans 48 heures.
Je croyais que les 4400
avaient des pouvoirs.
Comment se fait-il que
tu sois tellement insignifiant ?
Je crois que je suis chanceux.
Ok, on se tire.
Merci pour la bière.
On devrait arriver chez Eric demain.
Ca va être sympa de voir un visage amical,
on fera peut-être la grasse mat pour changer
Ca m'a l'air pas mal.
Tu apprécies Eric, n'est-ce pas ?
Bien sur, vous avez passé du temps
ensemble en quarantaine.
Richard, j'ai du retard.
Comme dans "j'ai du retard
donc je pourrais être enceinte."
Tu es sure ?
Non, je n'en suis pas sure.
J'ai du retard.
On va attendre et voir ce qui se passe.
Attendre et voir ce qui se passe ?
On pourrait aller à la pharmacie...
acheter un de ces tests.
Et qu'est-ce que tu souhaiterais
qu'il dise ?
J'aimerais qu'il dise: "Félicitations.
Vous avez un boulot, une maison,
et un avenir.
Vous êtes prêt pour un autre enfant."
Mais je ne pense pas qu'il va nous dire ça.
Non.
Probablement pas.
3150... 32, 33...
3400 dollars.
Ca devrait tenir ce salaud tranquille
pour un moment.
2 jours plus tard.
Je suis désolé pour ta voiture.
Je prendrais le bus jusqu'au travail.
Désolé pour la télévision.
Je lirai un livre.
Appelbaum, le faiseur de miracles, hein ?
Tu ne remarques pas quelque chose
de différent chez moi ?
Mon dieu...
35 kilos en 2 jours.
J'ai d'abord pensé que les termites
m'avaient bouffé. Tu sais, que j'avais
le cancer. Les médecins ont fait tous les
tests. Il s'avère que tout va bien. Mais
comment j'ai pu perdre autant de poids ?
Alors,
j'ai pensé à toi.
Toi et moi, on a partagé une bière,
et tu es un de ces 4400.
Qu'est-ce que ça prouve ?
Rien encore. Mais on va en être surs.
Je veux que tu boives une gorgée.
Parce que si j'ai raison, tu m'as
fait perdre tout ce poids,
et la même chose devrait arriver
à ma femme, qui...
bien  que je l'aime beaucoup, vraiment,
devrait perdre 10 kilos.
1 5.
Allez-y.
B uvez.
Appelbaum...
Ces gens qui t'ont enlevé,
t'ont lancé dans les affaires pour la vie.
Ils ont ramassé un commercial fainéant,
et ils t'ont ramené en tant que
"le régime humain."
"Le régime humain."
J'aime bien.
Vas-y.
Chloé !
Vous pouvez vous mettre à côté de la porte ?
Pour quand est prévu votre prochain album ?
Merci, merci.
Lire le livre de Jordan a été
une véritable révélation.
J'ai acheté des exemplaires
pour tous mes danseurs
et on en discute tous les soirs
après le concert.
Elle a raccourci sa tournée.
Oui, parce que je sentais
que je devais être ici.
Evidemment, je ne suis pas une des 4400.
mais j'attends d'être traitée
comme n'importe quel étudiant ici.
Si je suis assez chanceuse
pour pouvoir disposer d'un pouvoir,
je m'en servirai pour fournir au monde
un avenir meilleur.
Félicitations, Chloé Grenzer,
vous avez atteint
le premier niveau.
Merci.
L'année dernière, elle était dans Compila.
C'est incroyable, j'ai perdu 11 kilos.
Je n'avais pas pesé moins de 60 kilos
depuis le lycée.
Je t'avais dit qu'Appelbaum
était un super bon plan, n'est-ce pas ?
Quelle bonne idée
de l'avoir harcelé davantage.
Chérie, ce qu'on a obtenu de lui
représente tellement plus
que ce qu'il me devait, tu ne trouves pas ?
Tourne toi.
Question du jour :
Qui est Trent Appelbaum et pourquoi
la société Drandix m'appelle à son sujet ?
Appelbaum a disparu à la fin des années 80.
Il vend des portables, c'est ça ?
Et maintenant, il se vend lui-même.
Il prétend que sa salive est
un catalyseur pour la perte de poids.
Appelbaum a de quoi prouver ses dires ?
Deux clients très satisfaits.
Couple marié,
l'un a perdu 35 kilos, l'autre 11,
pratiquement en une nuit.
Mon dieu.
Ils ont mis une sérieuse option sur l'avenir
avec celui-là.
S'ils lui ont vraiment donné ce pouvoir,
ça pourrait être le remède contre l'obésité.
Oui, ça changerait le monde.
C'est déjà en train de changer le monde
de Trent Appelbaum.
Il a engagé un avocat, un agent,
ils demandaient 20 millions de dollars,
mais Trent fait monter les enchères
avec trois autres sociétés alors...
qui sait ce que sera le chiffre final.
Un 4400 qui vend ses droits d'exclusivités
sur son pouvoir, est-ce que c'est légal ?
Notre avocat est en train de chercher
une injonction, mais pour le moment,
aucune loi ne l'interdit spécifiquement.
Alors notre gars risque de
devenir un homme très riche.
On devrait peut-être lui rendre visite.
Ouais, découvrir s'il vaut vraiment
20 millions de dollars.
Héhé, le pilote de jet !
- Est-ce que je l'ai bien dit ?
- C'était assez proche.
alors... tu semblais un peu
paniqué au téléphone.
il y a quelque chose que
je devrais savoir ?
Ce serait mieux que tu ne le saches pas.
Hé !
Regardez-vous,
les tourtereaux de la quarantaine
du bâtiment B.
Ce petit bout de chou doit être Isabelle.
Ton papa m'a parlé de toi.
Je l'aurais parié.
Venez à l'intérieur.
Je vais vous montrer la chambre d'amis
à moins que quelqu'un veuille
dormir sur le canapé.
A -
pas trop minable pour mon premier
devoir de fac.
C'était un bon devoir, bien argumenté.
Alors pourquoi un moins ?
Eh bien, j'aime bien laisser un peu
de marge pour l'amélioration.
Les derniers jours de Pompéi.
Ouais, ils organisent cette fête
chaque année.
Vous devriez y aller, évacuer la pression.
Vous l'avez mérité.
Je déteste sortir seul, ça vous dit ?
J'ai probablement mérité cette menace en vous narguant,
ce n'est pas ma place, mais...
que ça ne vous empêche pas d'y aller.
Je ne sais pas comment ça marche,
ils ont mis quelque chose en moi.
une de ces enzymes,
ou quoi que ce soit d'autre.
Donc quelqu'un boit dans la même bouteille
que vous, et il perd du poids.
On devrait peut-être leur
faire une démonstration.
Ca suffit, Elise.
Elle pense qu'elle a besoin
de perdre quatre kilos.
- J'essaye d'en perdre cinq.
- Ma puce, tu es magnifique,
tu n'as pas un kilo à perdre.
Il a raison à propos de ça,
vous n'avez pas à perdre de poids.
Beaucoup de gosses vont
au lycée à 18 ans,
Elise a du travailler dans un resto.
Nous avons été séparés
pendant 16 ans,
mais pendant que j'étais parti,
ils m'ont donné un moyen de me rattraper.
M. Appelbaum, personne ne dit que vous n'avez
pas à subvenir aux besoins de votre fille.
Mais un 4400 qui met son don sur le marché,
c'est une première.
On veut s'assurer que personne
ne tire avantage de ça,
ni vous, ni l'acheteur, ni d'autres 4400
Vous n'avez rien à m'apprendre
sur la vente.
J'ai été vendeur toute ma vie.
La plupart des affaires dans lesquelles
j'ai trempé,
des bêtises
mais maintenant, j'ai un produit
qui intéresse tout le monde
et que moi seul peux fournir,
je suis ce foutu produit.
Personne ne remettra Trent Appelbaum
en cage.
Mon père s'est battu en Corée,
dans l'infanterie.
J'étais dans la 36ème aéroportée.
Eric me l'a dit.
Papa vous admirait, les gars.
Il disait qu'il n'y avait que
25 pilotes noirs dans tout l'Air Force
autorisés à voler comme tous les autres.
On n’était pas beaucoup, c'est vrai.
La première personne que
j'ai rencontrée à l'époque
ne pouvait même pas parler
de la guerre de Corée.
C'était aussi quelque chose
d'important dans notre famille,
Le Jour des Vétérans, une fois l'école finie,
on va toujours prier.
Oui, mon grand-père et ma mère
disaient qu'il m'emmènerait.
sauf que, rétrospectivement,
ils l'ont appelé le Jour de l'Armistice.
Pour celui de la première guerre mondiale,
il mettait ces bottes, il s'habillait,
et il allait voir ses camarades.
Papa était vraiment beau dans son uniforme
Je parie que vous aussi.
J'aimerais avoir l'occasion
de le rencontrer.
Ouais ben, trop tard.
Il nous a quittés, ça fera deux ans en août.
Je suis désolé de l'apprendre.
Merci.
Il aurait adoré vous rencontrer aussi.
Il avait 81 ans,
il est né quatre ans après moi.
Eh bien, heureusement pour toi,
je préfère les hommes plus âgés.
Richard, on sait ce que tu faisais en 1951,
mais maintenant ?
Eh bien, j'ai travaillé à temps partiel
Vraiment ?
Alors qu'est-ce qui vous amène
dans ce coin du pays ?
C'est assez éloigné pour des vacances.
Ils sont venus me voir,
en tant que 4400,
on doit se serrer les coudes.
On a des liens que vous, simples humains,
ne comprendrez jamais.
Eric, tu me fais halluciner quand tu parles
de cette union de merde des 4400.
Vous n'êtes pas très bavarde,
n'est-ce pas, Lily ?
Je  ne suis plus très habituée à
la vie sociale ces derniers temps.
Alors vous êtes un homme chanceux.
Avec elle,
que des blas blas,
mais je pense que
vous l'aviez déjà remarqué, non ?
Je dois aller aux toilettes
pour environ la 75ème fois aujourd'hui.
Je dois changer Isabelle.
Ce truc est joli.
Ils le sont tous.
Simplement, je les préfère dans ce livre
que sur l'épaule de quelqu'un.
Tu ne comprends pas, Dia.
Ces dessins ne doivent pas
vivre sur ces pages.
Ils doivent vivre sur la peau.
C'est très profond.
Mais tu as raison,
je ne comprends pas.
Moi si.
Tu dois laisser
cette brillante petite fille
venir avec moi demain.
C'est une boutique de tatouages.
Un temple de l'art corporel.
Et pendant 5 heures demain,
je suis l'artiste.
Tu dois être plutôt douée.
On peut y aller ?
Juste un petit peu.
Une heure.
Shawn, vous avez vu
l'emploi du temps de Chloé ?
Pourquoi je l'aurais vu, Devon ?
Elle a une interview demain à 3 heures, non ?
Avec de la chance,
elle mentionnera le centre.
Mais sa classe de nutrition
et de purification est à 3 heures.
Ouais, je crois avoir entendu Jordan
dire qu'elle en était excusée...
Elle a fait un régime macrobiotique,
pendant 3 ans.
C'est ce qu'elle dit aussi.
Ecoutez,
je suis certain que Jordan traitera
Chloé comme les autres étudiants.
Ok ?
Non, je suis prêt à fermer.
Je ne veux pas attendre,
dis-lui que c'est fait,
je le verrai demain.
Bon,
merci, Céline.
Combien ?
40 millions de dollars.
Où est le prochain plat ?
Ça arrive.
Mais,  ce sera
votre 4ème steak, Monsieur.
- On a faim.
- Ok,
je n'aimerais pas vous voir
vous rendre malade.
Personne n'est malade.
On a juste faim,
et on est affamé, allez,
enlevez vos mains, s'il vous plait.
Je suis affamé.
Bonjour, tu n'es pas habillé ?
Les types de Arkham films
sont là pour la promo.
Oh la vidéo pour le recrutement.
Tu peux t'occuper
de cet entretien, non ?
Bien sûr, si vous êtes trop occupé.
Salut.
Je parie que Jordan
va commencer tard ce matin.
C'est ma faute.
Je file à la douche, ok ?
La douche, c'est bien, Chloé.
Ferme la bouche, Shawn.
Tu vas gober des mouches.
Des leçons particulières
avec un premier niveau ? C'est...
C'est nouveau.
Premier niveau ou non,
Chloé demande... mérite
un autre niveau d'attention.
Elle est notre ticket d'entrée, Shawn,
dans le show-business.
Jordan, vous avez un chapitre entier
de votre livre qui descend ces gens-là.
C'est un cancer qui sépare les hommes,
qui aide à distinguer les nantis
des nécessiteux.
Et la culture 4400 est basée sur l'unité.
Oui, s'il te plait, Shawn
ne me récite pas.
Le fait est que les stars
ont des moyens, et une grande instabilité,
et on peut utiliser les deux à notre avantage.
Vous pouvez être
un putain de manipulateur.
Vous le savez ?
Ouais.
Bon,
ça aide d'utiliser toutes tes capacités
quand tu veux changer le monde.
Toi et Lily devriez penser à vous installer.
Je pense que cette fuite
vous met tous les deux sur les nerfs.
T'as remarqué.
C'est clair.
T'aurais pu tomber plus mal quà White Bird.
C'est calme.
Tout le monde s'occupe de ses affaires.
En fin de compte, tu devras arrêter
de sillonner les autoroutes.
Mieux vaut être ici,
qu'épuisé sur la route.
A propos, merci,
pour ne pas avoir demandé
ce que l'on fuyait.
J'ai pensé que si j'avais dû le savoir,
tu me l'aurais dit.
Ecoute, Richard.
J'ai assez de travail sur Livingston,
à m'occuper des résidences secondaires
des Stars.
Je ne suis pas contre un coup de main.
Tu  me proposes un job ?
Ils nous appelaient "hommes à tout faire".
Maintenant nous sommes des
"directeurs de propriétés".
Aussi, tu travaillerais avec moi,
pas pour moi.
Et vous signez juste là...
comme convenu...
votre bonus.
Quand est-ce que je commence ?
Vous faites le petit déjeuner.
En versant le lait sur vos céréales,
vous remarquez la photo
d'un enfant disparu sur le coté de la boite.
Vous réalisez après un moment
que c'est une photo de vous
à l'age de 10 ans.
Ça me donne des frissons.
Qui prépare ces trucs ?
Idiote.
Devon, ne laissez pas Jordan entendre
ce que vous dites.
Ils étaient ensemble hier soir.
Ouais, et probablement aussi ce matin.
Il y a un numéro de téléphone
sur l'avis de disparition.
C'est le numéro
de votre maison, enfant.
Rester ici ?
Tu veux dire tout le temps ?
C'est une jolie ville,
et Eric dit que je peux commencer
à bosser demain.
Ecoute, Lily.
On doit arrêter de fuir,
surtout si tu es de nouveau enceinte.
Je ne le suis pas.
Tu es sûre ?
Certaine.
S'il te plaît, n'essaie pas de prétendre que
tu n'es pas soulagé.
Soulagé ?
Lily, j'essayais de me faire
à cette idée, c'est tout.
Surtout si l'on n'a plus à fuir.
Je ne suis pas sûre de l'endroit, Richard.
- Isabelle pense...
- Oh,
laisse moi deviner.
On devrait continuer.
J'espérais qu'on irait à Salem,
dans l'Oregon.
J'ai des parents là-bas.
Je pense qu'ils nous aideront
et qu'ils resteront discrets.
Salem ?
C'est une ville.
On peut se fondre
dans la foule pour changer.
Cet endroit
cette vie, me semble bien pour moi.
C'est la vie d'Eric.
Ce n'est pas la tienne.
Pas la notre.
Non, ce n'est pas négociable.
C'est ma réponse, non.
Au revoir.
Laisse moi deviner, la réponse est non ?
C'était un représentant
de la compagnie Yoyotron.
Ils veulent que Maia signe un contrat
de $300,000 par an.
Mais Maia n'a plus de capacité.
Ils n'ont pas besoin de ça.
Ils veulent les 4400 à tout hasard.
Au cas où ils développeraient des capacités.
Tu as fait le bon choix
en disant non.
Tom,
pour Maia.
Quoi, elle va bien ?
Elle va très bien.
J'essaye de trouver la bonne manière
de te le dire.
J'aurais probablement
dû le faire tout de suite,
mais tu sais, les visions que Maia avait ?
Il se trouve qu'elle a simplement prétendu
qu'elles se sont arrêtées.
Tu sais depuis quand ?
Pas longtemps.
Je l'ai découvert en lisant son journal,
mais j'en ai pris plein les yeux.
Tu vas le dire à Jarvis ?
Je ne préfèrerais pas.
Donner le journal intime de ma fille
au gouvernement.
Ne me regarde pas comme ça, Tom.
Tu as gardé pour toi les capacités
de Shawn un moment.
Je pense qu'on est à égalité.
C'est aussi cool que ça en a l'air ?
Ta tante, c'est une vraie artiste.
Redis-le encore, petit Billy.
Je ne pense pas
que ma soeur t'ai entendu.
Je l'ai entendu.
Tu es une star.
Croyez-le.
Dès que j'ai su qu'April revenait,
je me suis tout de suite inscrit.
C'est presque tout mon corps.
C'est impressionnant.
Je suis fière de toi.
Attends un peu.
Tu ne viens pas de dire
que tu es fière de moi ?
Arrête, bien sûr que je le suis.
J'ai toujours cru
que tu te disais que j'étais une ratée.
Tu penses vraiment ça ?
Oui, vraiment.
April.
Tout ce que j'ai dit
c'est que j'aimais le tatouage.
Tu ne portes pas toujours ton casque ?
Tu devrais le porter ce soir.
Pourquoi donc ?
Tu n'arriveras pas chez Monica sinon.
Ça fait mal ?
Comment sais-tu pour ma copine ?
Je crois vraiment
que tu devrais porter ton casque.
- Tu l'as tué.
- Dimitri ?
Qu'est ce qu'il t'est arrivé ?
Ma femme est partie.
Les docteurs ont dit qu'elle était
morte de faim. Je suis le suivant.
Tu nous as tués tous les deux.
Combien de fois je dois le répéter ?
Je ne me souviens pas de cette boutique,
et bien sûr je ne me souviens pas
d'avoir brisé des vitres.
Ne pas te souvenir
n'est pas une excuse.
Et arrête de me dire
que quelqu'un a trafiqué ton verre.
La police a fait des tests, Kyle.
Tu n'as pas de trace de GHB.
Qu'est-ce que ça pourrait être d'autre ?
Tu as passé trois ans dans le coma.
Tu ne dois rien boire du tout !
D'accord, j'ai merdé,
qu'est ce que tu veux de plus ?
Pourquoi ne pas reconnaître
que c'est sérieux ?
Tu sais qu'ils voulaient t'inculper
de violation de domicile ?
Ce qui est un crime, au passage.
Si je n'avais pas joué ma carte NTAC,
tu serais dans une cellule maintenant.
Je peux aller au lit ?
Non, c'est sérieux.
Tu veux rattraper le temps perdu, Kyle.
J'ai compris.
Mais on doit parler de ta punition.
Je ne suis pas un gosse.
Je n'ai pas besoin d'être puni.
Je n'en suis plus si sûr depuis ce soir.
Réponds.
Quoi ?
Tu rigoles.
Ouais, j'arrive.
On finira plus tard.
Et que devient l'autorité ?
Ok, quelque chose de plus important
est arrivé.
Monte, Kyle.
Monte.
Richard ?
Que faites vous dehors ?
Je prends l'air.
Montez, on vous ramène.
Je lisais quelque chose hier sur Internet
à propos de votre unité de l'air force.
Sans rire.
J'y ai jeté un œil aussi quelques fois.
Vous étiez un des escadrons les plus décorés
Tara, tu arrêtes
de le harceler sur son passé ?
C'est bon, ça m'est égal.
Tant que vous êtes bavard,
j'ai une question pour vous...
que doit faire un frère dans les années 50
pour pouvoir piloter un avion.
Astiquer les bottes
des officiers le week-end ?
David.
Non, sérieusement, je me demande.
Vous deviez sacrement faire des courbettes
avant qu'ils ne vous donnent les clés, non ?
Ok, ça suffit.
Désolée, Richard.
Pas de problème.
Certains en disent plus
qu'ils n'en savent.
Je sais des choses.
Plus que vous ne réalisez.
Qu'est ce que ça veut dire ?
Ça veut dire arrête de minauder
et boucle la.
Pourquoi vous ne pas me déposer ici ?
Attends,
reste assis, et détends toi, ok ?
Tu vois ça ?
Ça s'appelle le mariage.
C'est tout.
Tu sais de quoi je parle.
Dimitri est mort ?
Une rupture d'organe dûe
à une malnutrition comme sa femme.
Ils devaient perdre 10, 15 kilos,
pas mourir de faim.
Vous êtes sûr
qu'il n'y a personne d'autre ?
De la famille ?
Des amis ?
Non.
Vous avez embrassé quelqu'un ?
Partagé un verre ?
Non, personne d'autre.
On pense savoir
ce qu'il s'est passé pour les Kazars.
Il y a une protéine dans votre salive
qui a suractivé leur métabolisme.
C'est une cachottiere aussi. Elle stimule le
cerveau pour qu'il libère de l'épinephrine.
et elle détruit les graisses en même temps.
Pas étonnant qu'ils aient brûlé
leurs calories
plus vite que leur corps
ne pouvait le supporter.
Ils auraient pu manger tout et n'importe quoi
ils auraient continué de mourir de faim.
Ca n'a pas de sens.
Nous sommes censés aider les gens,
n'est-ce pas ?
C'est pour cela qu'ils nous ont renvoyé.
Tout ce que je voulais,
c'était le bien de ma fille.
Maintenant je suis un meurtrier.
Ce n'est pas de votre faute, Trent.
Je suis censé me sentir mieux avec ça ?
Nous allons devoir vous garder ici.
Essayer de trouver un moyen
de supprimer la protéine de votre organisme.
Bon, la bonne nouvelle,
c'est que nous l'avons arrêté rapidement.
Beaucoup plus de gens
auraient pu être infectés.
Oh. Non.
J'étais à Drandix ce matin.
J'ai passé deux heures dans le labo pour
leur fournir des échantillons de tissu.
Ce n'est pas de ma faute,
et j'ai les documents pour l'attester.
Combien de gens avez vous testé ?
Vous voyez, mes supérieurs,
ils voulaient un programme de test clinique
effectif avant la fin de la journée.
- Ils m'ont dit: "Priorité absolue !"
- Combien ?
Une centaine.
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Hé, qu'est ce qui se passe ?
Qu'est ce qui se passe ?
Pourquoi Devon essaierait-elle de se tuer ?
Apparemment c'est une jeune fille
très perturbée.
Mais elle va s'en remettre quand même ?
Oui. Ils lui ont fait une gastrectomie
aux urgences.
Elle se repose chez elle.
Ok.
Je pense que le mieux
est de continuer à travailler.
Kyle, si les flics disent qu'on ne t'a pas
drogué, tu dois les croire non ?
Ils ont pu se tromper dans les tests.
Je n'ai pas bu tant que ça.
Peut-être que ton père a raison. Peut-être
que tu ne devrais pas boire du tout.
J'espère que c'était juste l'ivresse.
Qu'est ce que ça aurait pu être d'autre ?
Quand je suis sorti du coma.
Je n'étais pas tout à fait moi-même.
J'espère que ça n'est pas
en train de recommencer.
Je ne comprends pas tout.
Mais si tu as des pertes de mémoire,
tu devrais en parler à ton père.
Qu'est ce qu'il va y faire ? Me renvoyer au
centre médical du NTAC ?
Je ne retournerai pas en quarantaine.
Pas moyen.
Si vous cherchez Eric...
Tiens voilà tes maudites excuses.
De quoi est-ce que tu parles ?
Elle a été sur mon dos toute la matinée.
"Richard ceci." "Richard cela."
"Je devrais aller m'excuser."
A partir de maintenant,
tu ne t'approches plus de ma femme.
T'es fou, c'est ça ?
Je n’ai aucune vue sur ta femme.
Maintenant tu ferais mieux de t'en aller
et respirer un bon coup.
Mec, je vais où je veux.
Maintenant, tu m'écoutes.
Tu retournes chez toi.
Et tu vas faire tes excuses à Tara.
Et si tu as ne serait-ce
qu'un peu de cervelle,
tu vas commencer à mieux la traiter.
Parce que sinon,
un jour, quelqu'un va te la prendre.
Maintenant casse toi d'ici.
Trent, ceci ne nous aide pas.
Je devais voir ce que j'ai fait.
Vous voulez faire quelque chose ?
Retournez au labo.
Aidez les à trouver un moyen
pour contrer ça.
Laissez moi juste appeler Elise avant hein ?
Elle va se demander où j'étais cette nuit.
Aidez moi.
Elise ?
Papa ?
Aide moi.
Je suis désolée.
Je voulais juste perdre 5 kilos.
Bébé.
Je t'avais dis que tu es parfaite.
J'ai pris un de tes verres d'eau.
On va t'aider.
On va aider tout le monde.
Tom.
On a quelque chose.
Quoi ?
Dis moi.
Et bien, j'ai demandé aux gars en bas
si nous pouvions le comparer
au vaccin de la variole.
Utiliser des traces de l'antigène
pour le rendre plus résistant
et contrer les effets de la maladie.
Ces gens sont en train de mourir de faim.
Oui mais c'est à cause
d'une réaction chimique.
Ils ont fait une biopsie du foie de Trent.
C'est de là que vient la protéine.
Donc si on extrait la protéine.
Ils peuvent faire un sérum qui stimulera
la production d'anticorps chez les victimes.
Mais ils vont devoir lui prélever du tissu.
Ils ont besoin d'une grosse partie
du foie de Trent ?
Etant donné le temps qu'il nous reste,
ils veulent tout prendre.
Je n'ai jamais vu un tel coucher de soleil.
La façon dont il descend, lentement.
Comme s'il ne voulait pas
abandonner le ciel.
C'est un beau ciel.
Il vaut le coup qu'on s'y attarde.
Je suis désolé.
Pour quoi ?
Pour t'avoir laissé croire,
ne serait-ce qu'une seconde,
que je ne voulais pas avoir
un autre enfant avec toi.
Je veux bâtir un futur pour nous Lily.
J'ai juste besoin
de me remettre sur pied avant.
Et si on reste ici tu pourras.
Je suis sérieuse Richard.
Tu adores cet endroit.
Je ne veux pas m'opposer à ça.
Je détesterais avoir à me passer de ce ciel.
Moi aussi.
Etes-vous sûrs que ça va marcher au moins ?
Et bien c'est la seule option pour Elise.
Pour elle et tous les autres.
Nous avons trouvé un donneur compatible.
Le risque reste énorme.
Mais dites le mot et le foie est en chemin.
Ok alors.
Vous voulez qu'on se mette d'accord,
voilà mes exigences.
Vous voulez qu'Elise aille à l'école.
C'est déjà fait.
J'ai parlé à Drandix. Ils ont accepté
d'ouvrir une bourse à son nom.
- Conclu.
- Génial.
Ta mère les a mises dans un vase pour moi.
C'est une femme très gentille.
Elles sont très belles Shawn.
Il ne fallait pas te sentir obligé.
J'en avais envie.
J'espère que Jordan n'est pas trop contrarié.
Non.
Non.
Hé.
Il est sûrement trop occupé
avec sa starlette.
Devon.
Pourquoi est-ce que tu penses
à Jordan et Chloé ?
Hé.
Hé.
Tu n'as pas idée de ce que
je ressens pour lui.
A quel point c'est intense.
Je vénère Jordan.
pour tout ce qu'il m'a donné.
pour m'avoir permis d'être si près de lui.
Il a fait de moi quelqu'un que
je n'aurais jamais pensé pouvoir être.
Devon.
Tu veux dire que toi et Jordan...
Le coeur de Jordan est rempli d'amour.
Il partage cet amour avec moi.
C'est un honneur.
Un honneur que Chloé ne mérite pas.
Elle n'est pas un vrai disciple de Jordan.
Billy ?
Mon dieu, qu'est ce qui t'est arrivé ?
A la boutique l'autre nuit, j'ai été percuté
par une voiture en sortant du parking.
Mais tu portais ton casque n'est ce pas ?
Oui. Les médecins ont dit
que ça m'a sauvé la vie.
Comment as-tu su que ça allait m'arriver ?
L'intuition des enfants.
Je suis contente que tu ailles bien.
Oui.
Moi aussi.
C'est terrible de te perdre si vite.
Ca craint hein ?
Je pensais que mes dates à Atlanta
étaient reportées.
Maintenant ils me menacent de poursuites
si je ne viens pas.
Tu as fait tellement de progrès.
En si peu de temps.
Oui.
Crois moi, ça n'arrive pas si souvent.
Et bien.
J'espère bien que non.
Tu me connais Jordan...
J'aime me sentir spéciale.
Tu l'es.
C'était génial.
Je suis impatiente de revenir.
Au revoir.
Ca c'est de la formation accélérée.
"Troisième niveau"
en moins d'une semaine hein ?
Noblesse oblige Shawn.
Elle en tire profit et nous aussi.
C'est dommage que toutes les femmes
que tu as eu ne partagent pas ce bénéfice.
C'est petit et puéril.
J'attends plus de ta part.
Je connais la sensation.
Je suis tellement désolée pour vous deux.
- Qu'est ce qui ne va pas ?
- C'est David.
Il a visité le site web des 4400.
Ca disait que vous deux étiez manquants.
Que vous n'aviez pas donné de nouvelles
comme vous étiez censé le faire.
Je viens juste de l'entendre parler
au téléphone.
Il est en train de vous dénoncer
au gouvernement.
Désolé pour cet idiot de David, mec.
J'aurais tant aimé vous avoir par ici.
Merci de t'être occupé de nous.
Euh, je ne peux pas.
Prends le mec. Considère ça comme une avance
sur votre future maison, où qu'elle soit.
J'espère que vous trouverez un endroit sûr.
Je croyais que c'était ici.
Est ce que tout va bien se passer
pour mon père ?
Et bien il va être mis en soins intensifs
pour un bon moment.
Mais la transplantation s'est bien passée.
Votre père est un héros.
Je vais lui dire quand il se réveillera.
Si tu as quelque chose à me dire,
dis le maintenant.
Vous savez quoi ?
Vous voulez distribuer des niveaux
comme si c'était des tracts,
faites comme bon vous semble.
Cette femme va jouer devant
20000 personnes tous les soirs.
En portant notre logo.
En favorisant notre image.
Notre image ?
Parce que se foutre de votre secrétaire
favorise notre image Jordan ?
Je ne suis pas parfait.
Je n'ai jamais prétendu l'être.
Je n'ai pas besoin de perfection.
Je veux juste que vous arrêtiez
de me donner des raisons de penser que
vous n'êtes qu'une espèce d'hypocrite.
Quand tu seras aux commandes, Shawn.
tu pourras te comporter
aussi dignement que tu le veux.
Ce qui veut dire ?
Ce qui veut dire qu'un jour,
tout ceci sera à toi.
Les papiers sont prêts.
Les avocats savent ce qu'ils ont à faire.
Tout est prêt.
Mais vous ne partez pas ?
Néanmoins,
je dors mieux
en sachant que le travail de toute ma vie
est entre les mains
du saint,
de l'immaculé Shawn Farrell.
Donc on pensait avoir un remède aux
problèmes d'obésité du monde entier.
Oui et à la place, on a deux cadavres,
une centaine de personnes convalescentes,
et une entreprise qui brouille
les pistes pour se couvrir.
On dirait que la ruée vers l'or
des 4400 est finie.
Faisons le point sur ce petit exercice,
qu'est qu'on a exactement ?
Ils se sont peut-être trompés.
Ils pensaient avoir un remède,
mais en fait non.
Je veux dire, ils viennent du futur,
mais ce sont quand même des êtres humains,
n'est ce pas ?
Pas de conclusions hâtives.
On sait que l'effet sur le corps humain est
la perte rapide de poids.
Mais le but de cette protéine est
de provoquer un changement chimique
au niveau métabolique.
Elle pourrait être utilisée autrement.
Comme...
Je ne sais pas...
en éliminant les déchets toxiques.
Elle pourrait dépolluer les océans.
peut être même restaurer la couche d'ozone.
Donc en quelque sorte, les possibilités
sont infinies.
Mais c'est tout ce qu'on a pour le moment.
Des possibilités. Je veux dire, il faudra
des années avant de les mettre en pratique.
Mais avec ce nouveau foie, Applebaum ne
sera plus capable de produire la protéine.
Il n'aura pas besoin.
Maintenant qu'on l'a isolé,
on peut la reproduire.
Et chercher ce qu'on a vraiment ici.
Donc Trent a mérité sa récompense
après tout.
Peut être que sa fille
peut étudier la chimie au lycée.
Hé.
Bon.
On ne sera pas interrompu à cause de moi.
C'est le bon moment pour parler ?
Oui.
Ok.
Um.
Je veux te remercier
pour m'avoir tiré d'affaire avec les flics.
Ecoute Kyle.
Je sais que tu vas faire des erreurs.
J'en ai fait à ton âge.
Tout ce que je veux, c'est que
tu me laisses t'aider à en tirer partie.
Ca se comprend.
Donc je veux juste savoir
tu m'as dit tout ce qui s'est passé
l'autre nuit, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.

Précédemment dans les 4400...
Nous ne sommes pas sûrs
de ce qui vient de se produire.
La lumière a disparue,
laissant place à des milliers de gens.
Certains d'entre eux ont disparu
depuis plus de 60 ans.
Aucun n'a de souvenirs de
ce qui lui est arrivé.
J'ai vu ton frère.
Shawn ?
Tu sais, ces visions que Maia avait.
Il s'avère qu'elle a seulement prétendu
qu'elles s'étaient arrêtées.
Ne me regarde pas comme ça, Tom.
Tu as gardé pour toi le pouvoir de Shawn
pendant assez longtemps.
J'ai guéri
l'emphysème, la leucémie...
je ne comprends pas pourquoi ces crises continuent.
Ce bébé vous a vraiment mis dans un sale état.
Heidi, c'est maman.
Qui ?
J'ai une autre famille, maintenant,
et je suis désolé.
Je sais que ce n'est pas juste, mais...
Brian, je fais toujours partie de ta vie.
Si tu as des trous de mémoire,
tu devrais en parler à ton père.
Tu m'as bien dit tout ce qui s'était passé
l'autre nuit, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Shawn, on a besoin de vous !
Tout va bien, tout va bien, Jordan.
Tu n'as pas besoin de me veiller, Shawn.
Vous allez annuler votre apparition
à Riverfront Park ?
Non, ce serait une erreur.
Ce n'est pas uniquement moi qu'ils honorent.
Mais aussi le Centre, et
tout ce que nous avons accompli.
Une nouvelle clinique neurologique
vient d'ouvrir à Atlanta.
Non, écoute.
J'ai consulté tous les spécialistes,
Shawn. Ma maladie n'a aucun nom.
On ne peut pas simplement abandonner.
Il doit y avoir un moyen de savoir
ce que ce bébé vous a fait.
Je sais ce que ce bébé m'a fait.
Il m'a sauvé la vie.
Quoi ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Quand j'ai touché le ventre de Lily,
et que j'ai été frappé par la douleur,
j'ai réalisé que j'avais été jugé et qu'on m'avait trouvé défaillant.
Par un bébé qui n'était même pas encore né ?
A ce moment...
J'ai bien été obligé de reconnaître la vérité
à mon sujet.
à propos de mes motivations
envers les 4400,
et elles étaient...
impures.
Ce bébé a essayé de vous tuer.
Et il a réussit.
Il a tué l'ancien Jordan Collier, et je suis...
né à nouveau,
avec un dessein pur.
tout ce que j'ai fait depuis,
tout ce que j'ai construit,
je le dois à Richard,
à Lily,
et à cet enfant.
J'y vais.
- Hé.
- Bonjour.
Entrez.
Lily...
Regarde qui est là.
On aurait du appeler, mais...
Heidi voulait te faire la surprise.
Heidi...
Bonjour maman.
Elle est trop mignonne.
Maintenant que vous vivez dans le quartier, j'ai
pensé qu'il était temps pour Heidi
de rencontrer sa vraie mère.
Ca fait de toi mon 2ème papa.
Je crois, oui.
Maman, pourquoi est-ce que tu pleures ?
Lily, est-ce que ça va ?
- Lily ?
- Lily ?
Lily ?
Lily ?
Mon coeur, réveille-toi.
C'était un rêve...
plutôt un cauchemar.
Non, non.
On habitait à côté de chez Heidi et Brian, et
on était tous ensemble. Et la maison...
Richard, c'était si joli.
Alors pourquoi est-ce que tu pleurais ?
Je crois que je savais que ce n'était pas réel.
Combien de temps on va pouvoir continuer
avant que quelqu'un nous rattrape ?
On doit continuer à bouger,
à rester éloigné de Collier et du NTAC.
J'en ai vraiment assez de fuir.
On va trouver un endroit
où on pourra s'arrêter de fuir.
C'est tout prêt...
sûrement.
C'est bien.
Très bon travail jusque là.
C'est vraiment bien.
Bel emploi des couleurs.
Ca prend forme, Greg,
mais je pense que ça demande
encore un peu de travail.
Je peux pas faire mieux.
Ne perdez pas votre temps.
Mme Tobey,
voulez-vous bien nous suivre, s'il vous plait ?
Harmon.
Harmon...
Sam...
C'est quoi tout ça ?
Mme  Tobey, je vous mets en état d'arrestation.
Arrestation ?
Pour  quel motif ?
Pédophilie.
Mon  dieu.
Ecoute.
je sais que son acte de naissance
dit qu'il a 21 ans,
mais mentalement, Kyle est toujours un ado.
Je dois accepter le fait
qu'il va faire des conneries,
comme un ado.
Il tirera des leçons de ses erreurs,
il ne gagnera rien à fonctionner ainsi.
Ouais...
Mais Shawn...
Ca fait un an.
Comment a t-il pu couper les ponts comme ça ?
Et Danny.
Il se mine à l'intérieur.
C'était un garçon tellement gentil.
Oui. Je me souviens de ce que papa disait :
tu penses que t'as des problèmes ?
Attends de voir quand tu seras parent.
On ne s'en doutait pas.
Ouais.
Combien tu paries qu'ils sont en train
de parler de nous en bas ?
Ils ne vivent que pour ça.
S'ils n'avaient pas à se soucier de nous,
ils mourraient d'ennui.
Je t'ai vu sur le campus.
Je t'ai vu aussi.
Pourquoi tu n'es pas venu me parler ?
Ca fait, genre 4 ans.
Qu'est-ce que j'étais censé dire ?
"Bon retour du monde du coma" ?
Je sais pas. Je crois
que te voir me rappelle Shawn.
Vous étiez si proche.
Et tu étais comme notre ombre...
"Où est-ce que vous allez ? Je peux venir aussi ?"
Je vous trouvais vachement cools.
J'avais 14 ans, qu'est-ce que j'en savais ?
Maman m'a dit que tu lui avais parlé ?
Je ne pense pas qu'il m'ait écouté.
J'arrêtais pas de blâmer Shawn pour tout...
de m'avoir volé Nikki,
de s'éloigner de nous comme ça,
d'avoir brisé le coeur de maman.
Mais ce n'était pas sa faute.
Et les connards qui l'ont enlevé
ont renvoyé un monstre.
C'est leur faute.
Je crois qu'ils ont fait n'importe quoi
avec nous.
Je veux remercier le conseiller Lowe
au nom du Centre 4400 pour ce magnifique honneur.
En sponsorisant ce projet d'épuration,
je voulais rendre hommage
non seulement à la gloire du passé,
mais aussi aux promesses de l'avenir.
Je crois que les actions que nous menons,
les choix que nous faisons,
vont conditionner le genre d'avenir
dans lequel nous, nos enfants,
et leurs enfants allons vivre.
Merci.
- Hé.
- Hé !
Quoi ?
Enlevez vos mains.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez, me le casser ?
Arrêtez !
Hé ! C'est quoi le problème ?
Ces gens ne devraient pas se trouver ici.
Non, c'est vous qui ne devriez pas
être ici.
C'était notre maison, jusqu'à ce que vous,
sacs à foutre, décidiez de tout embellir
et de nous virer.
C'est bon. Vous pouvez les laisser partir.
Ils volaient de la nourriture.
Aux dernières nouvelles,
la nourriture était gratuite.
Ne me faites pas jouer au chef, allez.
Oui, Mr Farrell.
Merci.
Grand chef, hein ?
Je suis impressionnée
Je suis vraiment désolé
qu'on ait détruit votre abri.
Tu ferais mieux.
C'est diablement plus chaud ici
que de crécher sous le pont de la I-90.
La bouffe est bien gratuite ?
Oui, bien sûr,
je vous invite.
On fait comme ça.
Protéger le futur ?
Faudrait en avoir un.
Même sur une carte,
Fairview semble bien éloigné.
C'est à 4 heures maxi.
C'est ma première nuit loin de Maia.
Ta soeur n'est pas avec elle ?
Celle avec tous les tatouages ?
Désolé.
Les fûts que Kyle a commandés devraient arriver
- maintenant.
- Ouais.
Tu as lu les charges ?
"Le professeur est accusé
de mettre en péril par imprudence
la vie de ses élèves, leur bien-être
et d'être un risque à leur sécurité."
Ça pourrait être plus vague ?
Ça pourrait être de les pendre dans les bras
ou de pratiquer des attouchements.
Ou peut-être n'a-t-elle rien fait.
Ouais, je vote "rien".
Un tueur en série
dans les 4400 était déjà très mauvais.
Mais un 4400 abusant d'enfants ?
Ouais, qu'elle ne revienne pas !
Ni maintenant ni jamais.
Ecoutez.
Je ne sais pas
ce qui va arriver à Mlle Tobey.
Libérée sous caution ?
Oui, sa caution a été payée
par des parents de l'école.
S'ils se fichent de leurs enfants,
on s'en chargera nous-même.
Demandez à Sal. Il vous le dira.
Son fils a été abusé,
ainsi que Melinda et Teddy.
Et votre enfant Mr...
Venner.
Frank Venner.
Ce n'est pas qu'elle n'ait pas essayé
avec mon fils.
Greg a juste été un des chanceux.
Essayé quoi ?
Vous êtes qui vous deux ?
Je suis l'agent Skouris, voici
l'agent Baldwin. Nous sommes du NTAC.
Bien, vous arrivez à temps.
Ouais, les flics l'ont relâchée.
Vous pouvez la mettre en quarantaine
ou la coller en taule.
Elle n'est encore reconnue coupable de rien.
Elle n'est pas une 4400 ?
Elle n'aurait jamais dû revenir
dans cette école d'abord.
Selon les examens préliminaires,
aucuns des enfants
ne présente de signe d'abus.
Pas de marques, d'ecchymose ?
Pas de signes physiques,
à aucun niveau.
On parle de quoi alors ?
Un abus mental ?
Personnellement, je ne suis pas
convaincu que ce soit un abus.
mais il est certain,
certains élèves ont changé.
Changés ?
Dans quel sens ?
C'était superbe.
Je crois.
Tu me dis qu'avant 2 semaines,
tu n'avais jamais joué de violon.
Même jamais touché.
J'ai pris cette option car
l'art c'est généralement
la garantie d'un "A".
Vous êtes sensés apprendre
les peintres morts, et d'autres trucs.
C'est trop génial.
J'ai vu un tas d'argile.
J'ai vu la figure que je voulais faire.
J'ai taillé
ce dont je n'avais pas besoin et
voilà.
Vous devriez voir
comment elle vous fixe.
C'est comme si elle perçait un trou.
Pour essayer de rentrer à l'intérieur,
et vous réarranger le cerveau.
Elle m'a touché l'épaule.
Ce que je me rappelle ensuite.
Elle me tendait un violon.
Et je me tenais là, en me demandant
ce que je faisais avec un pinceau dans la main.
Et j'ai vu ce bloc d'argile,
c'était comme...
"où étiez-vous tout ce temps ?"
Le plus grand rêve de mon père était
de m'obtenir une bourse de football.
C'était aussi le mien.
Mais  ces histoires de peinture,
je suis à fond dedans maintenant.
Mlle Tobey est le meilleur prof
que j'ai eu de ma vie.
Mon père dit que ces gosses
semblent normaux maintenant.
mais dans 2 ans par exemple
ils pourraient développer des tumeurs,
devenir aveugles ou fous.
Qui sait ?
Vous devriez la remettre en prison.
Ton père,
ce n'est pas Frank Venner, par hasard ?
Comment vous savez ça ?
C'est juste...
une supposition.
Blessé mes étudiants ?
C'est ridicule.
Ce n'est pas ridicule pour ces parents.
Les gens s'effraient quand
ils ne reconnaissent plus leur enfant.
Mais ce sont les mêmes enfants.
Je les aide juste à trouver
ce qu'ils ont en eux, et à l'exprimer.
Comment vous faites ?
Je les étudie.
Parfois,
Il y a une lumière dans leurs yeux.
Comme une petite flamme,
et pendant que je regarde
elle devient plus brillante.
Dés lors je sais qu'il y a quelque chose en eux,
quelque chose de beau.
Cette lumière,
vous l'avez vue chez tout le monde ?
Ça ne semble pas marcher
pour les adultes.
ni pour tous les enfants.
Comme ce garçon, Greg Venner.
Je continue à regarder,
mais aussi loin...
Je crois que son père désir
que vous arrêtiez de regarder.
Frank ?
J'ai instruis Frank.
C'était un de mes étudiants en 72.
J'ai dû instruire la moitié
des parents qui veulent m'arrêter.
C'est fou, je n'ai rien fait de mal.
Je dois retourner prés de mes élèves.
Ceux qui m'ont enlevé.
Ce n'est pas par accident
qu'ils m'ont donné ce don.
Voilà pourquoi ils m'ont renvoyé.
Pour l'utiliser.
Tyler ?
Richard  Tyler ?
Richard Tyler.
Oui, je suis Richard Tyler.
A s'époumoner dans le froid
pendant 10 heures, on a gagné quoi ?
Moins de 20 balles.
On va faire quoi ?
Ça va nous faire vivre.
Qui a amené ça ?
Personne.
Repas d'amis.
Shawn, regarde qui est venu.
J'avais envie de pizza.
Je ne voulais pas manger seul.
mon très protecteur Parrain.
Ou t'es juste un riche qui cherche
à acheter une fille pour la nuit ?
Je ne suis pas là pour ça.
Quel est le problème ?
Je ne suis pas assez bien pour toi ?
Peut-être je ne suis pas
assez bien pour toi.
Je peux l'oublier.
Yo, Wayne. Pepperoni.
Tu vas rester à regarder,
ou tu vas t'asseoir et manger ?
Hello ?
Brian.
C'est moi, Lily.
Lily, où es-tu ?
Le NTAC m'a appelé
tout l'été pour te trouver.
Brian, j'ai besoin de ton aide.
Richard, il a été arrêté.
Tu es avocat.
Tu pourrais appeler le bureau du shérif
à Weldon, Idaho, et voir ce qu'il y a.
Je ne peux rien faire pour ce type,
je ne suis pas un avocat spécialisé dans le pénal.
Brian, si tu ne veux pas aider...
Je te jure, Lily,
tu disparais pendant un an,
et tu m'appelles parce que
la police a arrêté ton copain.
Richard est mon mari.
Nous avons un enfant.
Une petite fille de 6 mois.
Comment va Heidi ?
Elle va bien.
Elle est entrée en cinquième et
est dans les meilleurs au premier semestre.
C'est merveilleux.
Brian.
Je suis désolée d'avoir à t'embêter avec ça.
Mais
Je n'ai personne d'autre vers qui me tourner.
Ok. Je passerai quelques coups de fil
et je ferai ce que je peux.
La première fois que Mike est revenu
avec ce violon et a commencé à jouer,
sa mère et moi, on était
tous les deux un peu effrayés.
Alors pourquoi avez vous payé
la caution d'Heather ?
Je l'aurais payée intégralement
si j'en avais eu les moyens.
Ma  femme, elle a fait une vidéo de Mike
en train de jouer.
Elle l'a envoyé au conservatoire.
Le lendemain, ils rappelaient.
Disant que notre fils était un prodige.
Vous lui avez dit qu'il ne jouait que depuis deux semaines ?
Et bien, ils ont cru que je me moquais d'eux.
Ils m'ont dit que son talent méritait une bourse d'étude.
Vous savez, je pensais que ce gamin allait finir
sur une chaîne d'assemblage.
Comme son vieux père.
Maintenant il a un moyen de s'en sortir.
Mlle Tobey est au NTAC aujourd'hui pour des tests physiques.
Nous demandons aux parents des élèves à qui elle a offert un don
de venir là bas pour être interrogés.
Sans problème. J'appellerai sa mère.
Nous ferons tout notre possible pour ramener Heather dans cette classe.
Génial.
Merci.
Vous auriez dû les voir dévorer cette pizza.
En ayant juste de quoi se nourrir.
Vous savez, c'est une vraie lutte.
Et tu as rendu cette lutte plus facile.
Je suis fier de toi Shawn.
Je pense retourner là bas.
Il y a tellement de choses dont ils ont besoin.
Des vestes, des sacs de couchages peut-être.
Deux ou trois kits de premier secours.
Des trucs de base pour survivre, vous voyez.
Tu leur donnes toutes les provisions dont ils ont besoin.
Très bien.
Mais écoute.
Peu importe ce que tu fais, Shawn.
Ne révèle pas ton pouvoir de guérison.
Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'ils ne peuvent pas payer ?
Non.
Parce que si tu guéris l'un d'entre eux,
tu devras tous les guérir.
Je suis sérieux.
Même toi, tu ne peux pas faire ça.
Oui.
J'écoute.
Quand est-ce que ça s'est passé ?
Cool.
Je suis un peu rouillé.
Un de ces jours, je vais écrire
un album conceptuel.
A propos du temps que j'ai passé dans la rue.
Oh.
Je vais gagner un Grammy.
Décrocher la timbale.
Tu vois, m'acheter un jet privé.
Une de ces vieilles demeures avec une grille à l'entrée.
Avec assez de chambres pour Wayne, Kimmy et Shadow.
Ca semble être un bon plan.
Oui, ils vont bien avec tes yeux chérie.
Hé
Il y a des mois que je l'avais pas vu ne pas trembler.
C'est surprenant ce qu'un manteau bien chaud peut faire.
Tu t'es acheté une guitare, hein ?
Non, à vrai dire, tu sais quoi ?
Je t'ai acheté une guitare.
C'est quoi le problème, petite fille ?
On dirait qu'on ne t'a jamais offert de cadeau avant.
Ca fait un moment.
Tu y touches, tu meurs.
"Touches-y, tu meurs ?"
Je crois oui. Qu'est ce que ça veut dire ?
Je déteste faire la queue. Je déteste attendre la bas.
Fais moi confiance, il n'y aura pas d'attente ce soir.
J'ai été dans ce club plein de fois.
Je connais le videur, il nous laissera rentrer.
J'espère que tu dis vrai.
Je déteste faire la queue.
Hey, ce livre que vous lisez, c'est rien que des mensonges.
Excusez moi.
Je vous parle.
Cette merde va vous pourrir l'esprit.
Danny.
Qu'est ce qui se passe ?
Elle ferait bien de faire attention.
Ce livre est remplie de conneries.
- Je l'ai acheté pour elle.
- Ah oui ?
Grosse erreur.
Quelqu'un t'a demandé ton avis.
Danny, viens mec.
Surveille juste mes arrières ok ?
Ecoute mon ami.
Laisse moi te dire quelque chose sur les sectes.
Qu'est ce qui se passe ?
Vous me laissez partir ?
Bonjour, Richard.
C'est quoi ce sourire d'abruti ?
C'est rien, juste la façon que tu as de...
mordre ta langue quand tu essaies de te concentrer.
Je fais ça depuis que je suis gamine.
Depuis quand es-tu à Seattle ?
Deux ans.
J'ai quitté ma maman et mon nouveau copain.
et je suis venu ici pour la musique.
Je ne sais pas comment, mais ma vie a pris un tournant bizarre.
J'ai connu la même chose moi aussi.
Quoi ? Tu t'es enfui de chez toi aussi ?
Um.
En quelque sorte.
A part que j'ai eu de la chance, j'ai trouvé un endroit où m'enfuir.
Autrement...
Tu aurais fini comme nous, rejetés ?
Quelque chose dans ce style.
T'es un des ces gars des 4400 hein ?
Tu peux rendre mes yeux verts ?
Quoi ? Tu peux marcher sur l'eau ?
J'aime tes yeux tels qu'ils sont.
Et je peux à peine nager.
J'hallucine.
Qu'est ce que c'est que ce cirque ?
Dewey..
Je vois que tu t'es bien occupée.
Non bébé, c'est juste un mec.
Il nous a acheté de la nourriture et des couvertures.
Liv, qui est ce mec ?
Shawn, tu dois partir.
Je l'écouterais si j'étais toi.
Qu'est ce que tu fais ?
Tu vois, elle fait ce que je lui dis de faire.
Ca te pose un problème ?
Oui.
Oui. Ca me pose un problème.
Shawn, s'il te plait.
Tu as fait ta BA, mais..
rentre chez toi. Ok ? S'il te plait.
Viens avec moi.
Viens avec moi.
Et après quoi ?
Tu vas me sauver ?
Je veux pas être sauvée.
Casse toi d'ici.
Va t'en. Je suis sérieuse.
Va t'en !
Hé.
Tu ne retourneras pas dans cette école.
Tant que cette femme ne sera pas partie.
Et mes autres cours ?
J'ai des devoirs.
Depuis quand tu te soucies de l'école ?
Tu veux que je finisse comme toi ?
Hé. Fais gaffe à ce que tu dis.
Je veux pas prendre du retard.
Prendre du retard ?
Avec les notes que tu as ramenées ?
Tu as été en retard depuis
ton premier bulletin de notes.
Quoi ? Tu vas juste rester assis là
ou tu vas me parler ?
Parce que je pense vraiment que tu me dois une explication.
Tu sais, ces mecs voulaient me tuer.
Je me retourne.
Et mon cousin a disparu.
Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé.
Ouais. Je sais ce qui s'est passé.
Tu m'as laissé tomber.
Heureusement que le vigile était la.
L'autre fois, je pensais que c'était la bière.
Quand tu bois trop,
tu peux avoir des pertes de mémoire, non ? Mais
Aujourd'hui, je n'ai rien bu.
J'ai des pertes de mémoire,
je perds des morceaux de temps.
C'est comme si ils avaient fait quelque chose à mon organisme.
Ils ?
Kyle. De qui parles tu ?
Des même qui ont
enlevé Shawn,
qui ont provoqué mon coma.
Ils ont laissé quelque chose en moi.
Hé, mec. Tu me fais peur.
Qu'est ce que tu crois que je ressens ?
Brian.
Des nouvelles ?
Yeah. J'ai eu un entretien avec les autorités de Weldon.
Richard à été relâche de sa garde à vue.
Oh merci mon dieu.
Quand ?
Il y a environ une heure.
Pourquoi il n'a pas appelé ?
Vous êtes sure que vous ne voulez pas appeler Lily?
Lui faire savoir que vous allez bien ?
Est ce que je vais bien ?
Vous n'avez rien à craindre de moi, Richard.
Tout ce que je veux c'est vous faire une offre.
Si elle ne vous convient pas,
vous pouvez partir. Vous ne me reverrez plus jamais.
Combien d'argent avez vous donné à ces policiers
pour qu'ils vous appellent plutôt que l'NTAC
pour qu'ils aient ma description ?
C'est mon argent, Richard.
Regardez,
vous avez dit que j'étais libre de partir après avoir entendu votre offre.
Si vous en avez une,
faites la.
Je veux que vous reveniez à la maison,
vous et votre famille.
au centre des 4400.
Je ne pense pas.
Vous avez dit que vous aviez lu mon livre.
ce qui signifie que vous savez pourquoi nous avons été enlevés
et ce que nous sommes supposés faire.
Le futur...
Le futur est entre nos mains, Richard.
Vous. Moi. Lily... nous avons été choisis.
Allons Jordan.
nous savons tous les deux que cela n'a rien à voir avec moi ou Lily.
Tout ça est à propos d'Isabelle.
Isabelle.
Et bien, c'est un joli nom.
Pour une fois
pourquoi ne dites vous pas ce que vous voulez vraiment
nous l'enlever, la contrôler.
Votre fille
est le futur.
Je le croyais, je le crois toujours.
Alors qu'est ce qui a changé ?
J'ai changé.
J'ai besoin de plus que votre parole.
Bien sur.
Amenez moi à Isabelle.
Laissez la me juger.
Isabelle n'ira jamais prés de vous.
De quoi avez vous peur, Richard ?
C'est moi qui prends des risques.
Je souffre toujours des effets secondaires
de notre dernière rencontre.
Richard, c'est très simple.
Si je mens.
Si mes motivations ne sont pas sincères.
Isabelle me punira en conséquence.
et vous serez débarrassé de moi une fois pour toute.
Mais si je suis sincère,
si Isabelle m'accepte.
Alors je pourrai vous offrir à vous,
à Lily et à votre enfant une nouvelle vie.
Arrêtez de courir Richard.
Oublie ça.
Ca n'arrivera jamais.
Il n'y a aucune chance pour que je laisse Isabelle s'approcher de cet homme.
Mais pense à ça.
Si Collier avait vraiment changé,
ça voudrait dire que nous pourrions quitter la route, arrêter de fuir.
C'est un grand si.
Il nous offre d'être un intermédiaire entre nous et le NTAC.
Il dit qu'il peut les obliger à nous lâcher.
Et tu le crois ?
Il a des avocats,
toute une organisation derrière lui.
Nous pouvons à peine payer l'essence.
Il nous a déjà menti.
Cet homme a essayé de détruire notre relation.
Ok, disons qu'il ment.
Peut être que tout ceci est une sorte de piège...
pour mettre la main sur notre fille.
Il veut un face à face avec Isabelle ?
Je dis que nous devons lui donner.
Tu as vu de quoi elle est capable,
ce qu'elle peut faire si elle se sent menacée.
Ca semble toujours être un énorme risque.
Pour Collier.
Bienvenue, Heather.
Je suis désolée pour tout ça.
Quand les média seront moins intéressés,
tout ceci se calmera.
Tant que ce n'est pas le cas, nous devons discuter
de comment vous comptez gérer la sécurité.
Laissez moi mettre Heather au courant,
et je vous verrai dans mon bureau.
Ne t'installes pas, monstre ! Tu ne resteras pas !
J'aime celui ci avec la fumée et les nuages.
Greg.
Ton père sait que tu es là ?
Tout est de votre faute.
Tout allait bien jusqu'à ce que vous réapparaissiez.
Greg.
Pose ce pistolet s'il te plait.
Non.
Vous m'avez fait faire ça.
Je n'ai pas le choix.
Oui, tu as le choix,
mais seulement si tu poses ce pistolet.
Je ne pourrai plus être ici.
Mon père ne me laissera pas.
C'est ma dernière chance.
Greg, calme toi...
Non !
Pas avant que vous me changiez
comme vous l'avez fait avec eux.
Vous le devez !
Il n'y a rien à discuter.
Je prendrai n'importe quoi.
Le violon.
La peinture.
La photographie. Je m'en fous !
Ecoute Greg.
Ton problème c'est avec moi,
pas avec tes camarades de classe.
Laisses les partir,
et nous ferons un marché
seuls.
Ok, bien sur.
Ca marche pour moi.
Ok.
J'aimerai que vous partiez tous maintenant.
En silence, ne courrez pas.
- Mlle Tobey, est ce que ça ira ?
- Bouge !
Durant toute une semaine ?
C'est vraiment nécessaire ?
Depuis et vers l'école. Par pure précaution.
Une présence policière prolongée enverra un message clair
- à quiconque pensera qu'il peut...
- Ok
maintenant nous sommes seuls.
Maintenant, faites ce que vous avez promis !
est ce que tu pourrais poser ce pistolet.
- Non !
- Greg ?
S'il te plait. Pose ce pistolet.
Il me fait peur.
Et bien...
c'est supposé vous faire peur !
Greg...
D. A. dit qu'il n'y a pas de crime.
Bien, nous irons devant une cour civile.
- D'une façon ou d'une autre...
- Excusez nous.
Hey, mec, quel est ton problème ?
On a besoin de vous à l'intérieur.
Je ne me sens pas différent.
Greg, j'essaye.
Et bien essayez plus fort.
Vous avez trouvé quelque chose en Mike, en Rita...
vous pouvez trouver quelque chose en moi !
Je vous l'ai dit.
Je vous l'ai dit qu'elle était dangereuse.
Aucun d'entre vous n'a écouté.
Ce n'est pas elle qui tient le pistolet.
Greg est un gamin.
Il ne sait pas ce qu'il fait.
Elle lui a dérangé l'esprit.
J'ai des nouvelles pour vous.
J'ai su tout ce que j'avais à savoir la première fois que j'ai parlé à Greg.
Vous êtes celui qui lui a dérangé l'esprit.
Vous avez mis ce pistolet entre ses mains
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Nous savons tous les deux que c'est vrai...
et maintenant vous êtes celui qui va
sortir son fils vivant de là.
Bien.
Quel que soit le talent qu'ils ont,
ils l'avaient déjà en eux.
Mais nous parlons seulement d'une poignée d'élèves.
Vous l'avez trouvé en eux.
Vous pouvez le trouver en moi.
Vous le devez.
Avant que je ne devienne comme lui...
vous savez, mon père.
C'est de ça que tu as peur ?
Et vous vous inquiétiez du mal
qu'elle allait faire à votre fils ?
Vous savez comment est mon père.
Il n'est rien.
C'est un gros rien teigneux
et c'est exactement ce qu'il veut que je sois
et je ne peux pas laisser ça arriver.
Maintenant, sapristi, faites quelque chose !
C'est pas bon, hein ?
Il n'y a rien ici.
Je suis désolée.
Greg.
Tout le monde ne peut pas devenir artiste ou musicien.
Tu trouveras ta place.
Bien sûr que je trouverai.
J'ai un talent pour l'échec, tout comme lui.
Tu n'as pas à devenir comme ton père.
Quelque part en cours de route, il a fait un choix.
Tu peux en faire un différent
un meilleur.
Elle a raison, Greg.
Papa ?
Les erreurs que j'ai faites...
ce sont les miennes.
Ce ne sont pas les tiennes.
C'est pas parce que j'ai échoué
que ça veut dire que tu le dois aussi.
Pose ce pistolet s'il te plait Greg.
Ne laisse pas... ne laisse pas mes erreurs te faire tuer.
Yo, Shawn !
Tu dois faire quelque chose mec,
il a des convulsions.
De quoi tu parles ?
Dewey à vendu la guitare que tu as donnée à Liv.
Maintenant il délire complètement, hurlements et tout ce qui s'ensuit.
- Elle a besoin de toi.
- Allez, allez.
Je lui ai dit qu'il en avait trop pris !
Ce type meurt.
Non !
Non !
Non !
Jésus...
Qu'est ce que t'as fais ?
Il l'a ramené.
Bordel qu'est ce qui est arrivé ?
Qu'est ce qui est arrivé ?
Ce mec t'a sauvé la vie.
Merci.
Ma jambe...
S'il vous plait, réparez la.
Je suis désole, ça ne marche pas comme ça.
Pourquoi pas ? Vous l'avez bien aidé.
Je...
Non, je ne peux pas.
Je ne peux pas aider tout le monde, je suis désolé.
Je suis désolé.
Je ne peux pas aider tout le monde.
Je ne peux pas aider tout le monde.
Je ne peux pas aider tout le monde.
Non ! Ils ont besoin de toi.
Vous êtes sur de ça ?
Oui, j'en suis sur.
Lily...
c'est bon de vous revoir.
Et voilà Isabelle.
Bonjour.
Oui.
Oui.
Comment ça ?
Et bien,
Je pense que c'est fini.
Au revoir Fairview.
Au moins, cette fois, c'est votre choix.
Heu...
Je trouverai une autre ville,
une autre école,
peut être travailler dans le privé pendant un temps.
Je dois juste trouver un moyen d'utiliser ce don
sans provoquer tant de souffrance.
Et bien, le monde aura toujours besoin d'un peu plus de beauté.
Je l'espère.
Bonne chance.
Merci.
Tu sais, je pensais donner à Maia des leçons de piano.
Ah ouais ?
Je parie qu'elle aimera ça.
Ou peut être lui faire étudier la peinture,
car elle colorie tout le temps.
Je pense que tu peux appeler ça un effet papillon.
Un effet positif.
Ouais.

Pendant ces 60 derničres années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées
Elles ont été renvoyées
toutes ensemble
Sans aucun souvenir
de l'endroit oł elles étaient
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un seul jour
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des pouvoirs
Toutes tentent de se reconnecter...
... avec leur vie passée
Nous ne sommes pas la menace,
nous sommes le remčde.
Le monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans les 4400...
Tu sais, les visions que Maia avait ?
Il s'est avéré qu'elle a seulement
prétendu qu'elles avaient disparu.
Depuis combien de temps tu le sais ?
Pas longtemps.
Je l'ai découvert en lisant son journal.
Tu es un de ces 4400 n'est-ce pas ?
Un jour, tout ceci sera ą toi.
Mais tu ne vas nulle part, n'est-ce pas ?
Quoique tu fasses, Shawn,
ne révčle pas ton pouvoir de guérison.
Parce que si tu guéris l'un d'entre eux,
tu devras les guérir tous.
J'ai des pertes de mémoire.
Si tu perds des bribes de temps,
tu devrais en parler ą ton pčre.
Qu'est-ce qu'il ferait ?
Me renvoyer ą la clinique du NTAC ?
Je peux vous aider ?
Heidi, c'est maman.
Qui ?
Tout va bien, chérie, je m'en occupe.
C'est ma fille.
Elle ne le sait pas.
Elle pense que Carol est sa mčre.
Brian, écoute. J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Richard. Il a été arrźté.
Ok, je vais passer quelques coups de fils
et je ferai tout ce que je peux.
Bonjour Richard.
Je veux que vous rentriez ą la maison.
Si je mens, Isabelle
me punira en conséquence.
Si Isabelle m'accepte,
Alors je pourrai offrir ą toi, ą Lily
et ą l'enfant une nouvelle vie.
Laissez-la me juger.
Hush-a-bye.
Hush-a-bye.
go to sleep little baby
when you wake I'll give you cake
and all the pretty little horses
and go to sleep-y little baby.
Qui est une petite fille vraiment spéciale ?
C'est Isabelle cette petite fille
si spéciale ? C'est elle ?
Viens lą.
Regarde-le avec Isabelle.
Si ēa continue, on va devoir
commencer ą l'appeler Oncle Jordan.
Il y a vraiment quelque chose qui
ne tourne pas rond, non ?
Il y a une semaine,
c'était l'homme qu'on essayait
de tenir éloigné d'elle, et maintenant...
Ils sont inséparables.
Elle s'est vraiment attachée ą lui.
Ne serait-ce pas le couple ą la mode ?
Richard. Quoi de neuf, mon pote ?
C'est bon de te revoir.
Regarde-toi. Tu as l'air en forme.
Tu as l'air en forme.
Alors combien de temps
vous pensez rester ?
On n’est pas sūrs.
Collier nous a dit qu'on pourrait rester au
centre le temps de nous remettre sur pied.
Est-ce qu'il a tout arrangé avec le NTAC ?
Il a commencé.
Ses avocats ont pris nos dépositions.
Je pense qu'on va avoir droit ą des amendes
pour ne pas nous źtre signalés.
Eh bien, je suis sur que Jordan
prendra ēa en charge.
Il nous l'a proposé, mais je pense qu'on
va essayer de régler nos dettes nous-mźme.
Eh bien, vous avez choisi
la bonne semaine pour venir.
Cette réunion va źtre énorme, hein ?
On a des 4400 qui vont venir
de 27 pays différents.
Peut-źtre mźme de 3 autres.
Il n'y pas eu autant de 4400 ensemble
depuis la quarantaine.
Que s'est-il passé depuis qu'on
a quitté la ville. Je veux dire...
tout ą coup, on dirait que tout le monde
meurt d'envie de rencontrer un vrai 4400.
Qu'est-ce qui est arrivé ?
Jordan est arrivé.
Bienvenue dans la Révolution, jeune fille.
Oui.
Il va mourir ! Je l'ai vu, il va mourir !
Mon coeur, est-ce que ēa va ?
Tu as fait un cauchemar ?
Non. J'étais éveillée, et je l'ai vu.
Dis-nous ce que tu as vu.
Cet homme qu'on a vu ą la télé une fois.
Quel homme ?
Lui.
Jordan Collier ?
Quelqu'un va le tuer.
Autant que ce département sache,
Maia n'avait plus de visions.
Exact ?
Eh bien, elle m'a caché ce secret,
et elle écrivait tout dans son journal.
Mais je ne suis pas ici
pour parler de ma fille.
Nous sommes ici pour parler de Collier.
On pourra en parler tant qu'on voudra.
Mais si j'étais Collier, je rapporterais
vite fait mes bouquins ą la bibliothčque,
si vous voyez ce que je veux dire.
Cette enfant ne se trompe jamais,
n'est-ce pas ?
Autant que je sache,
Maia a deux sortes de visions.
Si elle peut voir assez clairement
un événement dans sa tźte,
elle peut parfois
influer sur le cours du temps.
Mais le plus souvent, ses visions sont
abstraites. Elle sont plus comme...
des certitudes.
Des prophéties.
On pourrait les appeler comme ēa.
C'est  l'une de celles-lą.
Et autant que je sache...
elles ne sont jamais fausses.
Pas  encore, en tout cas.
Mais jamais personne n'a fait d'effort
concerté pour les empźcher d'arriver.
Bon,  on peut toujours offrir ą Collier
une suite au sous-sol,
une surveillance 24h/24 et un goūteur.
Bien sūr. On a juste ą lui dire
qu'il doit rester isolé pendant quoi,
une semaine ? une année ?
Si on parle de prévenir un futur crime,
il n'y a aucune limite de temps,
et tout le monde est suspect.
Vraiment tout le monde.
Alors comment empźcher
l'inévitable d'arriver ?
Empźcher l'inévitable, ce n’est pas déją
ce qu'on fait tous les jours ?
Je veux dire que c'est pour cette raison que
les 4400 ont été renvoyés, non ?
J'aime bien cet état d'esprit
du "tout est possible", mais
je dois poser la question.
Est-ce qu'on veut au moins sauver Collier ?
Eh bien, c'est quand mźme
le méchant de l'histoire.
Peut-źtre que c'est ce que
l'avenir désire.
A moins qu'ils nous aient donné ce message
afin d'empźcher la mort de Collier.
Fascinant.
Quel cadeau extraordinaire.
Vous avez bien compris
ce qu'on vient de vous dire ?
Votre fille a une sorte de super capacité
ą voir le futur.
Sa derničre vision concernait ma mort.
J'ai oublié quelque chose ?
Non. C'est ą peu prčs ēa.
Le NTAC met ą votre disposition
toutes ses ressources. Ce qui veut dire
protection permanente,
évaluation de la menace
Et je suis invité, bien sūr, ą m'isoler.
Eh bien, ce serait la décision la plus sūre.
Disons que je suis disposé ą admettre
votre bonne foi, ce qui,
étant donné votre exploitation des 4400 pour
arriver jusqu'ą moi, est assez généreux...
Quoi ? Vous pensez qu'on a inventé ēa ?
Je ne suis pas sūr
que vous soyez aussi créatifs
mais votre plan demande mon repli complet
aux yeux du public
et l'annulation de la fźte célébrant
l'intérźt du public pour les 4400,
qui est prévue depuis des mois.
Notre passé commun est ce qu'il est,
mais ceci est la vérité,
et le dénier est un luxe
que vous ne pouvez vous permettre.
Merci pour l'information.
J'y penserai.
Maia ne se trompe jamais.
Quelque soit la protection
que vous pouvez me fournir,
je peux la prendre en charge moi-mźme.
Prenez de la documentation sur la réunion
sur le chemin du retour.
Les histoires des revenants étrangers
sont particuličrement instructives.
Tu viens toujours chaque jeudi, hein ?
Je pensais te trouver avec un peu de chance.
Lily.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je suis de retour ą Seattle.
Je voulais juste te remercier
d'avoir aidé Richard.
C'était juste quelques coups de fils.
Rien de décisif.
On était en mauvaise posture.
Tu as fait tout ce que tu as pu.
Ca signifie beaucoup.
Eh bien, tu n'avais pas
ą m'acheter quelque chose.
En fait, c'est pour Heidi.
C'est bientōt son anniversaire.
Oh, Lily...
C'est juste un petit sac ą main sympa.
Tu n'as pas ą lui dire que ēa vient de moi.
Je ne veux pas me mźler de ta vie, Brian.
J'essaye juste de te dire merci.
Ok.
Tu as l'air en forme, Lily.
Je suis content que les choses
marchent pour toi.
Je n'aurai pas le temps de parler
aux premiers niveaux aujourd'hui.
J'ai trop ą faire avec cette fźte.
Mais le cours commence dans 10 minutes.
Je ne peux pas, Lucy.
Vous allez devoir leur dire de considérer ēa
comme une heure d'étude.
Hum...
C'est ą poster. Merci.
Vous venez pour la visite ?
On peut te parler dehors ?
C'est un mauvais jour,
c'est de la folie ici.
Je t'avais dis qu'il nous jetterait.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Oh, Liv...
Ils étaient trop gźnés pour entrer.
Je ne peux pas. Je ne peux pas.
Mais j'ai vu ce que tu pouvais faire.
On l'a tous vu.
Tu peux guérir les gens.
Ecoute, ce n'est pas si simple.
Je ne peux pas guérir tout le monde.
Je ne te demande pas
de guérir tout le monde.
Juste eux.
Tu ne comprends pas,
c'est comme si ēa me vidait.
Je peux peut-źtre
le faire pour un, peut-źtre.
Un c'est mieux que rien.
Et qui choisi lequel, toi ?
Moi ?
Je ne peux pas guérir
le monde entier, désolé.
Qu'est-ce que je t'avais dit ?
Une perte de temps...
Ne me regarde pas comme ēa.
Kyle ?
T'es avec nous, mec ?
Quoi ?
Je croyais que tu étais...
tu sais, autre part.
Non je suis avec toi,
je réfléchissais juste.
Relax, je n’ai pas eu de trous de mémoire
depuis des jours.
J'espčre que c'est fini.
Ouais, moi aussi.
Je pense quand mźme que tu devrais
en parler ą ton pčre pour te faire examiner.
Tu veux venir avec moi, voir "the Kills" ?
Ok, donc...
On ignore cette histoire
de trous de mémoire...
Oui en gros.
Ils passent ą 8 h.
Tu devrais venir.
L'Administration de Sécurité des Transports
met sous surveillance
Ian Dravitt et ses acolytes connus.
Ils nous appellent
s'ils se montrent ą Seattle.
Toute cette histoire autour de Dravitt
c'est juste la derničre affaire de Collier
qui part en vrille.
Collier
avait son nom sur un gratte ciel
ą l'āge 30 ans.
Quand tu cours aprčs le pouvoir tźte baissé,
tu te fais des ennemis.
Donc on trouve celui qui correspond
le plus ą John Hinckley ou Sirhan Sirhan.
Et aprčs quoi ? On le traque
tout au long de sa vie ?
On pourrait passer toute l'année ą
répertorier les déplacements de Collier
depuis qu'il a fondé le Centre.
Ce type a eu toute une carričre
avant son enlčvement.
Ou peut-źtre alors que ēa vient de
quelqu'un que Collier ne connaīt pas.
Je veux dire, si tu détestes les 4400,
tuer leur emblčme est un bon moyen
de les faire souffrir.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'on est supposés faire ?
La victime potentielle refuse notre aide.
Personne n'a dit qu'empźcher
le futur allait źtre
simple.
Diana, regarde ēa.
Son nom est Miles Quinlan.
Il clame que Collier l'a ruiné,
et qu'aprčs il l'a viré du centre.
Il vit chez ses parents.
Quoi ?
Il nourrit un complexe de persécution ?
L’illustration parfaite
de la théorie d'Oswald.
Allons, Maia. J'ai cité tout les gars
avec qui je suis sortie au cours
des 5 derničres années.
Tu me dis que je n'ai aucun avenir
avec aucun d'entre eux ?
Ne t'inquičte pas pour ēa.
On dirait que tu rencontres
plein de garēons.
Oui, mais c'est le problčme,
j'en ai marre de rencontrer des garēons.
Je veux rencontrer un homme.
Ēa arrivera.
Quand ?
Tante April,
ce n'est pas parce que je ne le vois pas,
que ēa n'arrivera pas.
C'est probablement Mlle Bradshaw
de l'étage du dessus.
Elle va te surveiller ce soir
pendant que je vais bosser.
Pardon.
Ce n'est pas ma faute.
Tu me reconnais.
Vous źtes...
Jordan Collier.
Je ne voulais pas...
l 'effrayer.
Je voulais juste lui parler une minute.
Oui, et bien,
on dirait que ēa n'arrivera pas.
Elle croit que je vais mourir.
Présentez lui mes excuses
s'il vous plait.
Je lui ai apporté ēa.
J'espčre qu'elle n'en a pas déją une.
Merci.
Bonjour, je suis Lily Tyler.
Je crois que quelqu'un m'a demandé.
Excusez-moi.
Heidi...
Tu es ma mčre ?
Je les ai entendu
se disputer ą ton sujet.
Mon pčre et ma mčre...
Carol.
Ca ne te dérange pas si je continue
ą l'appeler "maman" ?
Je sais que c'est perturbant, ma petite.
Qu'ils parlent dans la pičce ą cōté,
ne veut pas dire que je les ne entends pas.
Ils ont dit que tu étais une 4400.
C'est pourquoi j'étais partie.
C'est pourquoi
on ne se connaīt pas vraiment.
Vous n'źtes pas venue
ą la maison, déją ?
C'est la premičre chose
que j'ai fait ą mon retour.
Je voulais te voir.
Mais ton pčre et moi, nous n'étions pas sūr
que ce soit une bonne idée.
Ma chérie, est-ce que ton pčre
sait que tu es lą ?
Non.
Je ne leur ai pas dit
que je les avais entendu.
Je ne suis pas allée ą l'école aujourd'hui.
Je suis venue ici.
Je suis ravie que tu l'aies fait.
C'était dur pour toi de ne pas me voir ?
C'est la chose la plus dure que
je n'ai jamais eu ą faire.
Je pense ą toi tous les jours.
Regarde.
C'est moi ?
C'est le jour
oł on t'a ramené de l'hōpital.
Tu es pareille que maintenant.
J'étais absente tellement longtemps mais...
Pour moi, c'est comme si c’était hier.
Vous voulez parler de Collier ?
Il utilise les gens, puis les
laisse sur le pavé.
C'est pourquoi
vous avez quitté le centre ?
Je ne suis pas parti.
Ils m'ont mis dehors.
C'est ce qui arrive,
quand vous n'avez plus d'argent.
Ils ont tous ces niveaux différents
qu'ils appellent clefs, ok ?
Quand  vous atteignez la septičme
clef, vous źtes libre.
"Libre"... signifie que vous avez
une capacité de 4400 ?
C'est la grande récompense, seulement
ils font en sorte que personne ne l'ait.
Il y a des niveaux intermédiaires,
et des séminaires que vous devez réussir.
Si vous n'źtes pas un 4400,
vous devez payer pour chacun d'entre eux.
D'abord j'ai épuisé mes économies,
puis j'ai liquidé ma maison.
Et ils ne vous ont pas libéré.
Au premier chčque refusé par la banque.
ils m'ont dit que j'avais atteint mon
maximum, et m'ont dit de suivre ma route.
C'est pourquoi vous avez fait
une demande de permis de port d'armes ?
On a fait une vérification sur la base
de données des crimes violents ce matin.
J'ai acheté une arme et alors ?
Je dois me protéger de Collier.
J'espčre que l'auto-défense est tout
ce que vous avez ą l'esprit,
parce que si vous prévoyez autre chose,
on sera sur vous ą la minute
oł vous approcherez du centre des 4400.
Vous voulez une raison pour źtre parano ?
Pensez-y.
Tu simplifies le problčme.
Annuler le gala
ne garantira pas ma sécurité.
C'est un début.
Jordan, tu me dis qu'il y a une fille
qui voit l'avenir et qui t'a vu mort.
Fais toi plus discret.
Et oł ēa s'arrźtera ?
Je dois rester loin du centre ?
Et me retirer de notre travail ?
Si ēa peut te garder en vie, oui.
Je ne vais pas...
devenir un ermite.
Ca ne serait pas une victoire pour nous.
Ecoute, le centre semble
plus sūr qu'il ne parait.
La moitié des gens en tenue d’ouvrier
sont des gardes du corps.
Vous prévoyez de mourir en public ?
Tu as vraiment le sens du drame, tu le sais ?
C'est une menace pour moi, pas pour toi.
Ecoutez, Jordan, je suis désolé,
je suis juste...
Je ne suis pas
prźt ą devenir un martyre.
Et vous n’avez pas ą l'źtre.
Je sais que vous attendez ce week-end
depuis longtemps.
Rassembler tous les 4400.
C'est comme
un aboutissement pour tout ce que
vous avez fait jusqu'ą maintenant.
Mais si quelque chose devait vous arriver
ēa pourrait anéantir tout
ce que nous avons commencé.
Le mouvement n'est pas prźt
ą ce que vous deveniez un martyre.
Va t'en, c'est tout, va t'en.
Oł étais tu ?
J'étais sur le point de te faire biper.
Richard, il y a quelqu'un
que j'aimerais te présenter.
Voici ma fille,
Heidi.
Elle est venue au centre pour me rencontrer.
Nous étions en train de parler.
Eh bien.
Je suis vraiment heureux de te rencontrer.
Je  suis Richard Tyler,
je suis marié ą Lily...
... ta mčre.
Elle me l'a dit.
Je suis heureuse de vous rencontrer aussi.
- Est-ce...
- Isabelle.
C'est ta demi-soeur.
N'aie pas peur.
Je suis désolée.
Elle doit avoir faim.
C'est bon.
Je dois rentrer ą la maison de toute faēon.
Bien. J'espčre que je pourrai te revoir.
Je l'espčre aussi.
Peut źtre que la prochaine fois
je pourrais prendre Isabelle dans mes bras.
Je parie que ēa pourra se faire.
Je te raccompagne.
Plus d'école buissonničre, ok ?
Quel est le problčme ?
Tout ce que je dis c'est qu'il était
plus grand que je me l’imaginais.
Eh bien, grand ou petit.
Collier n'a rien ą faire ici.
Je suis totalement d'accord Di,
je ne l'ai pas laissé entrer.
Tante April aime les hommes grands.
Oh.
Donc tu as parlé d'hommes avec ma fille ?
C'est une enfant.
Ca ą dū arriver par mégarde.
Hey, maman ?
Pourquoi tu n'as jamais de rencard ?
Eh bien...
Je ne dirais pas jamais.
Mais tante April passe son temps ą sortir.
Je pense que ta tante est un exemple extrźme
Comment saurai-je lequel est le bon ?
Peu ou beaucoup ?
Je pense qu'il faut plutōt chercher
entre les deux.
J'essayerai.
Mais est-ce que les rencards
doivent toujours źtre avec des garēons ?
Ils sont si grossiers.
Tu t'y habitueras.
Pouvons-nous avoir cette conversation
dans 2 ou 3 ans, peut-źtre 10 ans ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Oh, une femme l'a laissé aujourd'hui.
Oh, c'est une citation ą comparaītre.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Eh bien, c'est quand quelqu'un veut
que tu lui remettes quelque chose
De qui ēa vient ?
De mes patrons.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils veulent ?
Ton journal.
Kyle !
Ca va mec ?
Tu n’as pas bu, hein ?
Juste du Coca light.
- Le son est vraiment fort ici, hein ?
- Ouais, mais ils sont géniaux, hein ?
Tu veux y retourner ?
Allez viens, mon pote nous garde
des places prčs de la scčne.
Sais-tu quelle heure il est ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais lą ?
Kyle ! Sais-tu quelle heure il est ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais
devant mon appartement ?
Je ne sais pas, j'étais au pub.
Tu me fais peur.
Depuis combien de temps es-tu ici ?
Je sais pas. Je crois que j'étais en train
de planer ou quelque chose comme ēa.
Ecoutes, Kyle, je crois que tu devrais
partir, On peut parler de ēa demain.
Je suis désolé, Je ne voulais pas
te faire peur, c'est encore arrivé.
Laissez moi entrer ! Laissez moi entrer !
Virez vos sales pattes de moi !
Vous ne comprenez pas,
c'est un charlatan.
Vous tous, vous m'entendez ?
Votre mascotte est un charlatan.
Liv, tu dois te calmer.
C'est bon les mecs, je m'en charge.
Toute ma vie,
j'ai cherché une seule et unique chose,
juste une chose en laquelle croire.
Je pensais que c'était toi.
Ca fait combien de temps
que tu es défoncée ?
Tu va m'aider ou quoi ?
Est-ce que tu vas cesser
de me hurler dessus ?
J'en ai fini avec toi,
une bonne fois pour toute.
Retourne dans tes appartements dorés,
Fais comme si nous n'existions pas.
Tout le monde le fait.
Pourquoi pas toi ?
Ecoute...
Calme toi.
je ne te laisserai pas retourner
dans la nuit dans un état pareil.
Tu peux dormir sur mon divan.
Je te tiens,
c'est bon.
C'est toi qui es ą l’origine
de tout ēa, tu sais.
Tout ce qu'il y a autour de toi
a pris forme aprčs que tu m'aies montré
la voie que je devais suivre
Je ne sais que faire, cependant.
Je pourrais compter sur les doigts d'une
main le nombre de fois oł j'ai dit cela.
mais maintenant c'est vrai.
C'est vrai, si tu sais quelque chose,
maintenant, serait un bon moment
pour le dire ą oncle Jordan, hein ?
Merci.
Merci.
La réunion aura lieu.
Diana, l'un des tireurs engagés par Dravitt
a disparu en ville la nuit derničre.
Son nom est Laurent Ganning.
Il est fiché par la TSA.
Bien, avons-nous une idée
d'oł il peut źtre ?
Il s'est juste présenté ą un motel sur
"first hill" sous le nom de Lawrence Gawain
C'est clair.
Tom...
Il est en mouvement.
Wendy, attend,
je suis désolé, je suis désolé.
Tu attendais dans le couloir devant
mon appartement la nuit derničre.
Sais-tu ą quel point c’est étrange ?
Je ne sais pas comment je suis arrivé lą,
s'il te plait, crois moi. Je... Je...
J'ai eu un autre trou noir la nuit derničre.
Ecoute, Kyle, ēa empire,
et je ne peux pas te fournir
l'aide dont tu as besoin.
Donc tu veux juste que je m'en aille ?
Non, je...
Je voudrais que tu parles ą quelqu'un
quelqu'un de compétent.
J'ai peur pour toi.
Peur pour moi ou peur de moi ?
Et restons humble devant le courage
de nos invités étrangers,
Car beaucoup d'entre eux ont pris tellement
de risques pour źtre ici aujourd'hui...
Vous savez, Glen.
J'ai quelques méchants échos, Pouvons-nous
ajuster le volume des enceintes du fond ?
Test, Test.
Test.
Vous savez, c'est beaucoup mieux.
Personne ne bouge !
Tout le monde reste ou il est.
Ne bougez pas, ne bougez pas !
Mettez vos mains sur la tźte,
mettez les en l'air.
Tournez vous, tournez vous !
Baissez vous, baissez vous !
Le pistolet de Ganning était fait en
polymčre synthétique, les balles aussi.
Il a passé votre détecteur de métaux
sans un beep.
Vous étiez la pour l'attraper,
il n'aurait jamais pu me tuer.
Il était ą 60cms de vous
avec une arme ą feu chargée.
Tout ceci a commencé ą cause de Maia.
La vision de votre fille
a été un cadeau pour moi,
une prescription, si vous voulez.
Pour changer le futur.
Dans une des réalités
la balle de Ganning me tue.
Je peux seulement dire
que quelqu'un a un autre plan pour moi.
Et bien,
je n'en mettrai pas encore ma main ą couper.
Je n'ai aucune intention d'annuler les
mesures de sécurité supplémentaires.
Les mźmes mesures supplémentaires qui ont
permis ą un assassin d'arriver jusqu'ą vous.
Est-ce que le NTAC aimerait
źtre présent au gala de demain ?
Oui.
Mr. Collier,
nous ne nous tiendrons pas ą l'écart,
pour regarder,
Nous prendrons les choses en main.
Je délivrerai les autorisations.
C'était une démonstration plutōt
radicale de vos compétences, ą l'instant.
Quelle heure est-il ?
Prés de 2 heures
Comment je me suis retrouvée ici au fait ?
Liv,
tu étais vraiment défoncée la nuit derničre.
Mais es-tu en train de me dire
que tu ne te souviens pas ?
Je m'en souviens.
Tu n'es pas obligé de me surveiller.
Je ne vais rien voler.
La femme de ménage peut venir pour
nettoyer le divan dčs que je serai partie.
Combien de nuits comme celle-ci
crois-tu qu'il te reste ?
Avec un peu de chance, pas beaucoup
T'as vu ma vie.
Quand je ferai une overdose.
Ca ne sera pas une grosse perte.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Et comment ēa pourrait changer ?
Je me sentais pareil avant.
Ce que je t'ai dit, c'était sérieux.
Je ne peux pas sauver le monde entier.
et je ne peux mźme pas sauver tes amis.
et j'en suis désolé.
Mais si tu comptes sérieusement changer,
peut-źtre que je peux te sauver.
Comment ?
En te donnant
la mźme chose qui m'a sauvé moi.
Il est ici.
Bonjour, content de vous voir.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Content de vous voir.
Bonjour mon amour.
Nous y voilą.
Je pense que je dois...
Ravi de vous rencontrer.
Bonjour.
Content de vous voir.
Bonjour.
Excusez moi, monsieur.
Tous les invités ont déją été contrōlés.
Oui, nous avons sécurisé les toits
des bātiments alentours,
et cherché des traces de bombes.
Donc maintenant il ne nous reste plus
qu'ą croiser les doigts.
Oui.
Bonne aprčs-midi.
Merci d'źtre venus au centre.
Nous avons prévu une grande journée
pour vous aujourd'hui, mais
avant que nous commencions.
J'aimerais remercier l'homme
qui a rendu tout cela possible.
Ce que je veux dire, littéralement,
c'est qu'il ne s'est pas
contenté de nous acheter ą manger.
Il a construit cet endroit.
et ce mouvement.
J'aimerais donc que vous accueilliez
mon mentor s'il vous plaīt,
mon ami...
Mr. Jordan Collier.
Merci. Et merci ą toi, Shawn,
pour cette présentation.
Euh... Restons modestes
devant le courage
de nos invités étrangers,
qui ont pris tant de risques
pour źtre ici aujourd'hui.
Venez.
Je veux juste entendre
ce que cet homme a vraiment ą dire.
Jordan ?
Il est lą haut ! Allez !
Tout le monde va bien ?
Tout le monde reste ą terre !
A terre, tout le monde
Il y a un tireur.
Tout le monde se calme ! Restez ą terre.
Restez ą terre.
Il y a un tireur, ok, il y a un tireur.
Laissez moi y aller, laissez moi y aller.
Oh. mon dieu !
Oh. mon dieu...
Préparez une civičre.
S'il vous plaīt laissez nous
faire notre boulot les gars.
Les gars, non !
Hey !
S'il vous plait laissez moi faire !
S'il vous plait !
Le pouls est faible et filant.
Allez, dépźchons nous !
Restez oł vous źtes !
Il ne respire plus.
On est en train de le perdre.
Non ! Vous n’allez nul part.
Shawn !
Shawn !
Elle m'a dit d’affronter cette épreuve.
Qui ēa ?
Elle ment.
Non...
Non, Non, Non,
Non...
Non...
Brian. Je n'ai pas beaucoup de temps.
Je n'ai pas violé notre accord.
C'est Heidi qui m'a trouvée.
Lily.
Heidi est malade.
Elle est ą l'hōpital.
C'est arrivé hier.
Il y a un problčme avec sa rate.
Ils ont dū l'opérer sur le champ.
Elle va bien ?
Est-ce que je peux la voir ?
Elle va bien.
Elle est encore
en train de se remettre de l'anesthésie.
Elle t'a demandé.
Elle est encore en salle de réveil. Mais
Carol ne voit pas d'inconvénient
ą ce que tu viennes lą bas demain.
Brian. Que s'est-il passé ?
Sa rate ? Elle a 12 ans.
Elle s'est juste rompue.
Ses médecins ont dit qu'ils n'avaient
jamais vu quelque chose comme ēa.
Ils ne peuvent mźme
pas nous dire pourquoi.
Oł étais tu ?
Les obsčques sont sur le point de commencer.
Lily. Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Heidi est malade.
et je pense qu'Isabelle en est responsable.
Je pense qu'ils vous attendent.
Vous allez lire beaucoup de choses
ą propos de Jordan Collier
dans les prochaines semaines.
Il y aura des bonnes choses
mais surtout des mauvaises.
J'ignorerai tout cela.
Comme Jordan aurait fait.
Parce que Jordan aurait utilisé les médias.
Mais il ne se serait jamais
laissé séduire par eux.
Je pourrais vous dire
tout ce que je dois ą cet homme.
Il m'a accueilli
quand je me sentais seul et perdu,
désorienté.
Je suis certain que beaucoup parmi vous
ont vécu une histoire similaire
Le fait est
que toutes les personnes vivantes
aujourd'hui,
qu'elles en soient conscientes ou non
le doivent ą Jordan Collier.
Il avait une vision pour préserver le futur.
Et il nous a inculqué cette vision.
et maintenant, il ne sera plus lą
pour nous voir l'achever.
Mais nous l'achčverons.
Je vous le promets. Nous l'achčverons.
Nous avons tous souffert
d'une perte immense.
Nos coeurs sont meurtris et nous souffrons
au plus profond de nous-mźmes.
Mais nous ne laisserons pas
cela nous arrźter.
et je ne laisserai pas cela m'arrźter.
Nous ferons honneur ą Jordan Collier.
et nous créerons
le futur meilleur
pour lequel il est mort.
Merci d'źtre venus.
Au revoir.
Beau discours. shawn.
Je pense que Collier aurait approuvé.
Oui.
J'espčre bien.
Il aurait aimé que tu viennes.
Oh, je ne pense pas que j'étais
aussi haut dans son estime.
N'en sois pas aussi sūr.
Vous vous źtes combattus.
Mais vous croyiez en la mźme chose,
que les 4400 sont la clé du futur.
Vos buts respectifs étaient identiques.
Mais nos méthodes étaient différentes.
Pas aussi différentes que tu ne le crois.
Tu vois, c'est lą que ta vision de
Jordan Collier diffčre de la mienne.
Et bien, au moins,
nous avons un point commun.
Peut-źtre que nos deux camps
peuvent travailler ensemble maintenant que
j'assume de nouvelles responsabilités ici.
Tu es en train de devenir un politicien,
Shawn.
Maintenant,
je sais que Collier aurait été fier de toi.
Il a disparu. Son corps. Il n'est plus lą.
Quelqu'un a volé le corps.
Il n'y a qu'une sortie.
Et nous nous tenons juste devant.
Comment aurait-il été volé ?
Que s'est-il passé alors ?
Jordan Collier assassiné.
Qui est le 4400 guérisseur ?

Pendant ces 60 derničres années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées
Elles ont été renvoyées
toutes ensemble
Sans aucun souvenir
de l'endroit oů elles étaient
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un seul jour
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des pouvoirs
Toutes tentent de se reconnecter...
... avec leur vie passée
Nous ne sommes pas la menace,
nous sommes le remčde.
Le monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans "Les 4400"...
Je ne suis plus ton petit frčre.
Alors arręte d'agir comme si tu avais 2 ans.
Tu es mon frčre.
C'est ta petite amie.
Tout est clair.
Bon sang de taré !
Danny, arręte !
Arręte de m'accuser pour Nikki !
Diana Skouris, votre demande d'adoption de
Maia Rutledge est, par ceci, effective.
Il va mourir. Je l'ai vu.
Il va mourir.
Jordan Collier ?
Quelqu'un va le tuer.
Non !
Non !
Son corps, il n'est pas lŕ !
C'est ta nouvelle maison ?
C'est la tienne aussi.
J'ai attendu ce moment depuis tant de temps.
Une seule chose vous manque...
Maman.
On a vraiment tout fait pour que ça marche.
Comment s'est passé
ton premier jour au lycée ?
Je n'ai pas eu de premier jour.
Personne n'a payé pour les cours.
Je suis désolé, Kyle.
J'ai dű oublier.
On parle de cela depuis des mois
Comment as-tu pu oublier ?
Tu as passé 3 années dans le coma.
Tu ne dois pas boire !
Tu m'as dit tout ce qui s'est
passé cette nuit lŕ, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Il reste du café ?
Sers-toi.
Tu n'as pas trouvé de t-shirt propre ?
C'est ce que je porte ŕ l'école.
J'aime bien. Tu as l'air classe.
Merci.
Donc...
Comment tu vas, papa ?
Bien. Ca va. Pourquoi ?
Pour rien. C'est juste que, euh,
tu sais. Bonne chance.
Ok ? Je penserai ŕ toi.
Ok ? Je t'appellerai.
Voir comment ça va. Ok ?
A plus tard.
Hey, le voilŕ !
Qu'est-ce que c'est que tout ça ?
Bon retour.
L'enfant prodige est de retour.
De retour d'oů ?
Mets la machine en route,
faut que ça reparte.
Tom, je suis si contente de te voir.
Oui, toi et tous les autres.
Dčs qu'on aura arręté Doherty,
on sabrera le champagne
Doherty ? Qui est Doherty ? Diana, attends.
Mets moi au courant. Qui est Doherty ?
Est-ce qu'il a quelque chose ŕ voir
avec le meurtre de Collier ?
Quoi ? Le gouverneur Collier ?
De quoi est-ce que tu parles ?
Il n'est pas mort.
C'est une idée de Garrity, n'est-ce pas ?
Je dois l'admettre, il a de l'imagination.
Mais la journée "on-se-fout-de-Tom-Balwdin"
est terminée.
Hey, écoute, Tom, ne fais pas ça.
Les médecins t'ont trouvé
en parfaite santé.
Les médecins ? Quels médecins ?
Oů est-ce qu'ils vont tous ?
Et qu'est-ce qui se passe ici aujourd'hui ?
Je pense que tu ferais mieux de rester ici.
On en parlera ŕ mon retour.
Diana, c'est juste que...
Donc, ce gars, Doherty, est-il un 4400 ?
C'est quoi un 4400 ?
S'il te plait, arręte ça.
4400 personnes disparues... L'avenir
les a renvoyés dans une boule de lumičre.
Ca ne te dit rien ?
Diana,
Je ne plaisante pas.
Donc quel que soit le jeu auquel tu joues,
arręte, et arręte tout de suite.
Tom, tout ce que tu as traversé
durant ces derniers mois,
je ne peux męme pas l'imaginer,
et tout le monde fait tout pour que tu
t'en remettes, mais écoute ce que tu dis,
tu as l'air d'halluciner.
L'avenir ? Je veux dire,
je n'ai jamais entendu parler des 4400.
Et je peux te promettre que personne
n'est revenu dans une boule de lumičre.
Dis moi une chose. D'aprčs toi,
qu'est-ce qu'on a fait
pendant toute cette année ?
Tu es sérieux ?
Fais moi plaisir.
C'est ton dossier, Tom.
Les bombes sales, tu te rappelles ?
Tu étais sous couverture pour infiltrer une
cellule terroriste de la secte Aum Shinrikyo
Rien de tout ça n'a de sens pour toi,
n'est-ce pas ?
Bien sűr que non. Pourquoi ça devrait ?
Eh bien, ta couverture a été compromise.
Tu as été détenu pendant 3 semaines.
Privation de sommeil, torture...
Ils t'auraient tué
si tu ne t'étais pas échappé.
Et quel est le rôle de Doherty ?
Aum Shinrikyo avait planifié une attaque
sur les Etats-Unis,
Ils ont fait entrer du matériel radioactif
dans le pays via des colis pour un musée.
Doherty en est le conservateur. Il a
coopéré avec eux depuis le début.
Tom, il t'a vendu.
Tu as passé 3 semaines en enfer
ŕ cause de ce gars.
Tu  as été en arręt thérapeutique
pendant 2 mois, pour t'en remettre, et...
de toute évidence, ça aurait dű ętre 3 mois.
Le  musée d'art contemporain
de Jordan Collier.
Dis moi que tu reconnais cet endroit.
-  Je le reconnais, ok...
- Eh bien, c'est un début.
Mais tout est différent.
C'est ŕ cet endroit. C'est...
C'est ici que Collier a été abattu.
Fais moi une faveur. Ne laisse personne
t'entendre dire ça.
Tom ?
Tom !
Est-il lŕ-dedans ?
Oui, je crois.
Ok.
Tu en veux l'honneur ?
As-tu trouvé quelque chose ?
Quelqu'un a bidouillé mon ordinateur.
Tous mes fichiers ont disparu.
Je tape "4400" dans un
moteur de recherche et...
Rien. Comment ça se fait qu'il ne soit fait
mention d'eux nulle part ?
Peut-ętre parce que...
rien de tout ça ne s'est produit ?
Quelque chose a changé en toute évidence.
Ce n'est pas le męme monde qu'hier.
Mais je suis...
je suis toujours Tom Baldwin,
et tu es toujours Diana Skouris,
ce qui veut dire que...
les gens qu'ils ont enlevés,
existent aussi, n'est-ce pas ?
Gary Navarro.
On a travaillé avec lui le mois dernier.
Il pouvait lire dans les pensées.
Lire dans les pensées ? Tom, allez.
A joué pour Cincinnati ? Une moyenne de 317
ŕ la batte sur toute sa carričre.
Ne serait-ce pas plutôt 300 quand tu sais
ce que le lanceur pense ?
Mais, il n'a jamais été enlevé !
Richard Tyler ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il avait ? Vision thermique ?
Non, certains peuvent faire des choses...
D'autres,
D'autres ne peuvent rien faire.
Il est mort.
Son avion a été abattu au-dessus
de Sinanju en 1951.
Donc ça en fait 2 de moins.
Si on doit se taper les 4398 autres,
ne compte pas sur moi.
Diana, ta fille. Ta fille !
Ta fille, Maia Rutledge. Tu l'as adopté,
n'est-ce pas ? Elle est l'un d'entre eux.
Tom, ne m'inclus pas dans tes fantasmes.
Tu sais bien que je n'ai pas de fille.
Si ! Juste ici. C'est l'adresse de Maia
Rutledge ŕ Seattle. C'est juste ici.
Juste ici.
Oh, merci mon dieu. Maia, c'est moi.
C'est moi, Tom. Tom Baldwin.
Je ne vous connais pas.
Ne dis pas ça, s'il te plait.
Ne dis pas ça.
Mon nom est Ella.
Maia est ma grand-mčre.
Ella, qui est-ce ?
Oh, la voilŕ.
Voici ma grand-mčre.
- Vous ętes Maia Rutledge ?
- Puis-je vous aider ?
Je ne t'attendais pas aussi tôt.
Comment ça s'est passé lŕ-bas aujourd'hui ?
Heureux de te voir aussi. Tout va bien ?
Dis moi juste une chose.
Tu as été dans le coma pendant...
pendant 3 ans, n'est-ce pas ?
Si j'en buvais une de plus, je pourrais
tomber tout de suite dans le coma.
Viens, je veux te montrer quelque chose.
Viens.
Ouais !
Oncle Tommy ! On peut enfin manger !
Comment tu vas ?
Shawn,
qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Eh bien, le groupe a pris du retard ŕ Berlin
On ne va pas commencer ŕ
enregistrer avant mardi.
De plus, je ne pouvais pas
manquer ton grand jour.
Ou celui de Danny.
Vas-y, dis leur.
Crois le ou pas, elle a vraiment dit "oui."
On va se marier.
Regarde, il m'a offert ça !
Oh, je lui ai pourtant dit
que je n'en voulais pas
tant qu'il n'avait pas
fini sa fac de droit.
Ca te plait ?
Vous allez bien, Mr. Baldwin ?
Papa, as-tu besoin de t'asseoir ?
Ca ne peut pas ętre une farce.
Il y a trop de gens dans le coup.
Assieds-toi.
Soit c'est moi qui
ne tourne pas rond, soit c'est le monde.
Papa,
les médecins ont dit que tu allais bien.
Je ne veux pas t'effrayer mais
quelque chose ne va pas.
Je ne reconnais pas cet endroit.
Je veux dire, je le reconnais en
quelque sorte, mais tout a été modifié.
Papa, papa, regarde moi.
Ce que tu dis n'a pas de sens.
Tu t'en rends compte, n'est-ce pas ?
Alors les gars vous avez commencé
sans nous ? C'est trčs bien.
Le trafic ŕ l'aéroport était dément.
Bonjour les gars, Nikki.
Tu arrives ŕ croire que mon gamin, mon
plus jeune gamin va se marier ?
Quand sommes nous
devenus aussi vieux ?
Alors tu es de nouveau en selle.
Comment ça s'est passé ?
Pas trčs bien je crois.
Vraiment ? J'étais juste en train de dire ŕ
ta femme que tu allais aller mieux.
Ma femme ?
Je suis toujours marié ŕ Linda ?
J'ai dit ta femme, pas ton ex-femme.
Alana, lŕ-bas. Viens par ici.
Je n'ai jamais vu cette femme auparavant.
Je crois qu'on a besoin d'ętre seuls...
Allons en haut, pour parler.
Non. Je ne sais pas qui vous ętes.
Papa, Alana est ta femme. Tu es marié
avec elle depuis 2 ans. Elle vit ici, papa.
Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles,
mais c'est fini, c'est fini.
Comment m'as tu trouvé ?
Les gars en bas ont appelé. Ils ont dit
que ça fait 4 heures que tu es ici.
Ouais, c'est triste, n'est-ce pas ?
Il n'y a qu'en me cachant dans débarras
que je me sens normal.
Je suppose que c'est la sensation
qu'on a quand on est fou.
Tu n'es pas fou, Tom.
Tu as juste besoin de repos.
Tout le monde continue de me dire
que j'ai été torturé.
Peut-ętre qu'ils ont brisé mon esprit.
Tu vas t'en remettre, Tom.
C'est juste que ça va prendre du temps.
Et je vais t'aider.
Je te le promets.
Donc parlez moi encore
de cette boule de lumičre.
Quand croyez-vous que
c'est arrivé pour la premičre fois ?
Le 14 aoűt 2004. C'est ŕ ce
moment qu'ils sont revenus.
Peut-ętre pas dans le monde que vous
connaissez. Mais c'est arrivé dans le mien.
Faites la sortir d'ici !
Personne ne complote contre toi, Tom.
J'ai fait ce que je devais faire
pour que tu ailles mieux.
Sa femme est ici. Elle demande ŕ le voir.
Je ne suis pas marié.
Je ne suis pas marié.
Ecoutez madame, je ne sais pas qui vous ętes
Et je me fous de ce que vous avez ŕ dire.
Tu dois jouer le jeu.
J'ai besoin que tu sortes d'ici. Afin
qu'on puisse comprendre ce qui se passe.
De quoi parlez vous ?
Rien de tout ça n'est réel pour moi non plus
Je sais que nous ne sommes pas mariés.
Je ne t'avais jamais vu avant hier.
Ces choses dont tu parles...
La boule de lumičre, les 4400...
Vous ętes au courant ŕ propos des 4400 ?
Tu les connais ?
Je suis une 4400.
- 72H PLUS TARD -
Je sais que mon comportement était hors de
propos. Et je voudrais m'en excuser.
J'ai fait une fixation
sur mon retour au travail,
et de toute évidence,
la pression, la, euh...
l'excitation, c'était juste trop pour moi.
Nous allons prolonger votre arręt
thérapeutique de 6 semaines,
et alors on verra si vous pouvez
retourner sur le terrain.
Je marquerai cette date sur mon agenda.
Ok.
Donc je peux partir maintenant ?
Votre détention psychiatrique est terminée.
Je...
Je  suis désolé pour le guet-apens.
Période désespérée, mesures désespérée.
Je te verrai dans 6 semaines.
- Tom Baldwin.
- Alana Mareva.
Donc je suppose que nous sommes mariés.
C'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
Allons ŕ la maison.
Voir si on arrive ŕ comprendre
ce qui se passe ici.
Oů crois tu que nous nous trouvons ?
Je ne sais pas, on a peut-ętre
traversé une sorte de...
réalité alternative,
une dimension différente.
Je sais, ça a l'air dingue.
Ca semble impossible.
L'impossible n'est plus ce qu'il était,
et...
Tu es une 4400.
Tu penses que c'est moi qui fait tout ça ?
C'est une explication.
Une explication simpliste ŕ vrai dire.
Simpliste, et fausse.
Si j'étais en train de faire cela,
pourquoi est-ce que je me placerais
en plein milieu de ta vie ?
Je suis désolé. Ca ne doit pas ętre
facile pour toi non plus.
Ouais, facile.
Mes amis, ma famille...
Tout ce que je connais a disparu.
Effacé.
Je suis piégée au milieu de ta vie.
Comment je peux savoir que ce
n'est pas toi qui fait tout ça ?
Effacé ? Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire,
ta vie a été effacée ?
Cet endroit m'appartenait.
Je l'ai acheté il y a 4 ans, quelques
mois avant que je ne sois enlevée.
Et rien de tout ça ne te dit
quelque chose maintenant ?
J'ai parcouru le monde entier, et acheté
principalement des sculptures,
de l'art primitif.
Excusez-moi.
Puis-je parler au propriétaire ?
Il n'est pas lŕ aujourd'hui.
Savez-vous depuis combien de temps
il a ouvert cet endroit ?
Il y a longtemps, 15, peut-ętre 20 ans.
Ca ne fait qu'empirer.
Tu es sűre que c'est ce banc ?
Je venais ici toutes les semaines.
Crois-moi, je sais quel banc j'ai dédié
ŕ mon mari et ŕ mon fils.
Donc dans le monde d'oů nous venons...
Ils sont morts...
dans un accident de voiture...
Peu de temps avant que je ne sois enlevée.
Il  y a un moyen de rentrer chez nous.
Nous allons le trouver.
Si tu as besoin de quoi que ce soit,
je serai juste dans l'entrée.
Quoi, tu dors dans la chambre d'amis ?
Dans ces circonstances, oui.
Je ne pense pas que ce soit une bonne idée.
On doit jouer le jeu. Nous sommes supposés
mariés et heureux.
On ne veut pas que ton fils
pose des questions.
Okay, euh, je vais trouver
une place par terre.
Es-tu sűr que ce ne serait pas plus
confortable dans la baignoire ?
Je plaisante, Thomas.
Le lit est grand.
Je suis sűre qu'on peut
rester chacun de notre côté.
Est-ce que tu penses que
nous sommes les seuls ?
Est-ce qu'il y a d'autres gens dehors,
comme nous,
en train de se demander comment
ils sont arrivés lŕ ?
S'il y en a, on les trouvera.
On passera des annonces classées dans
tous les journaux importants de cette ville.
"Des souvenirs des 4400 ?
Laissez nous un mot."
On vérifiera tous les revenants
qu'on pourra trouver.
Dis moi quelque chose ŕ propos de toi.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux savoir ?
Mes disques préférés ?
L'école oů je suis allée ?
Ton mari et ton fils ? Comment étaient-ils ?
Paul était radiologue.
On s'est rencontrés lorsque il était
en vacances ŕ Tahiti.
C'est de lŕ que je viens.
Linda et moi avions envisagé d'aller lŕ-bas
pour notre lune de miel. On...
On a choisi Haďti ŕ la place.
2 ans plus tard, aprčs s'ętre mariés,
on a eu Billy.
Il était si calme et si doux.
C'est incroyable.
Je pense que c'était l'entretien oů
j'avais dit vouloir faire médecine
- 2 SEMAINES PLUS TARD -
parce que les infirmičres sont sexy.
Tu n'as pas dit ça.
Je suis admis en fac de médecine !
Stanford baby !
Félicitations.
Le vrai Kyle disait tout le temps
qu'il voulait devenir médecin.
Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'il tombe dans le coma.
"Le vrai Kyle..."
Je sais que ce n'est pas tout ŕ fait
ton fils, mais il me semble bien réel.
Il est heureux quand
il entend de bonnes nouvelles,
grincheux quand il est fatigué, et il
oublie de rabattre la cuvette des toilettes.
C'est un bon gamin.
Il a bien grandi.
J'ai une réponse ŕ notre annonce
dans le Seattle Post.
Philip Kendrick, il veut nous rencontrer.
Philip Kendrick ?
Tom Baldwin.
De quoi vous souvenez-vous
ŕ propos des 4400 ?
C'est  la meilleure berline
que Citroën n'ait jamais sorti.
Suspensions hydrauliques de série
sur tous les modčles...
Vous parlez d'une voiture ?
Oui ! La mienne est garée dehors.
Oů est la votre ?
Elle est au garage.
Je vous enverrai une photo.
Euh, Tom, je n'ai pas votre adresse.
Eh bien, c'était... productif.
Ouais...
Est-ce qu'on va jeter un oeil ŕ l'expo Blake
tant qu'on est ici ?
Euh... oui, pourquoi ne...
Pourquoi ne partirai tu pas devant ?
Je te rejoins dans une minute.
Non, c'est...
Thomas...
Thomas...
Thomas...
Thomas ?
Thomas !
C'est parti.
- Qu'est-ce qui est parti ?
- Cette porte.
Elle était revenue,
et je l'ai ouverte cette fois.
C'était une sorte de salle d'opération,
je crois.
Je n'ai rien vu de semblable.
Tu te tenais juste lŕ, comme une statue.
Cette pičce est lŕ réponse. C'est obligé.
C'est la seule chose qui
ne va pas avec le reste.
Elle ne fait pas partie de cette réalité.
Męme si elle existe, tu es le seul
qui peut la voir.
Je dois y retourner.
Je dois y retourner.
- UN MOIS PLUS TARD -
Hey, partenaire.
Noir, deux sucres.
Alors, les gardiens m'ont dit
que tu avais passé...
cinq heures ici hier,
trois le jour d'avant, et,
et samedi ils en ont compté 12.
Oui, et alors, j'aime l'art.
C'est une belle porte,
fonctionnelle, Tom, mais,
je n'appellerais pas ça une oeuvre d'art.
Maintenant, peut-ętre que si c'était
de l'obsidienne noire...
J'ai lu ton dossier psychologique.
Tu prévois de me faire enfermer
encore une fois, Diana ?
Tu sais, cette autre réalité,
oů tu as
peur de retourner ?
Je veux dire,
męme si tu pouvais y retourner,
ça n'a vraiment pas l'air terrible, Tom.
Lŕ-bas, tu étais divorcé.
Ici, tu as une femme magnifique.
Lŕ-bas, ton fils, Kyle, a passé
quatre années dans le coma.
Ici, il s'appręte ŕ en passer quatre
en faculté de médecine.
Lŕ-bas, la famille de ta soeur
est complčtement disloquée,
ton neveu est dans une secte,
et l'avenir du monde est en péril.
Tu rends tout ça si...
Lugubre. C'est juste...
C'est juste la vie.
C'est la vie,
et c'est une vie meilleure pour toi et
pour tous ceux qui comptent ŕ tes yeux.
Accepte simplement ce que tu as.
Parce que si tu ne le fais pas,
eh bien, tu vas passer le reste de ta vie
assis dans ce hall d'entrée.
Alana ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
As-tu vu ces photos ?
Regarde toutes les choses
qu'on a faites ensemble.
Tu vois, tu penses que
si nous étions retenus ici,
ils nous auraient donné tous ces souvenirs.
Tu vois ?
Regarde, on a été en Chine. Toute ma vie
j'ai toujours voulu aller en Chine.
Ecoute, Alana, je ne sais pas combien
de temps il nous faudra pour sortir d'ici.
Je ne sais pas.
Qui a dit qu'on en sortirait ?
Tu n'arrętes pas de parler de cette porte.
Ca va faire un mois déjŕ.
Et si elle ne revient pas ?
Alors nous sommes piégés, ok,
nous sommes piégés. Je ne...
Mais si nous le sommes, Alana, je te promets
on se construira de nouveaux souvenirs.
Aussi biens que ceux-lŕ.
Mieux encore.
Oh, je crois qu'on pourrait, Thomas.
J'aime quand tu m'appelles comme ça.
"Thomas".
Et ça remonte, et alors… Ugh, je n'arrive
jamais ŕ les faire correctement.
- 8 ANS PLUS TARD -
Laisse moi essayer. Viens ici.
Tiens toi droit.
Tu dois te rappeler qu'il faut
faire des grandes boucles.
Laisse toi un peu de place
pour faire le reste.
Des mains de chirurgien.
Des mains d'interne, plutôt.
Non, tu vas y arriver.
Alors comment tu te sens lŕ-bas ŕ St. Bede ?
Je ne compte plus les heures. Les médecins
me traitent comme un bénévole exalté.
Je ne me rappelle plus ce qu'est une bonne
nuit de sommeil. J'adore !
Eh bien, je ressemble ŕ une figurine
sur une pičce montée.
Hey, c'est ton idée.
Il y a des gens qui vont aux Fidji
pour leur 10čme anniversaire de mariage.
Vous deux avez préféré renouveler vos voeux.
Oui, eh bien, la premičre fois ressemblait
plus ŕ des photos dans un album. Cette fois,
Cette fois est pour moi et Alana.
Pręt ŕ y aller, champion ?
Et vous, Alana Baldwin,
voulez-vous renouveler votre engagement
pour honorer, obéir,
et aimer votre mari, Thomas, jusqu'ŕ
ce que la mort vous sépare ?
Je le veux. Je le veux.
Alors, par le pouvoir qui m'est donné,
je vous déclare ŕ nouveau, mari et femme.
Ouais !
Allez-y vous pouvez embrasser votre
belle mariée.
J'arrive.
Oh, je vous aime les gars.
Ouais, hey !
Alors comment vous sentez-vous,
Mme Baldwin ?
Mariée, enfin.
Ca a l'air réel maintenant, hein ?
Eh bien ça l'était depuis un long moment.
Il est difficile de croire
qu'on y ait résisté.
Oui.
Est-ce qu'elle te manque ?
Ton ancienne vie ?
J'y pense encore,
Mais aprčs toutes ces années,
cette vie, ce monde...
on dirait une illusion.
Je sais, je dois męme me concentrer
pour me souvenir de la vie sans toi.
Tu vois, je suis bon pour ça.
Comme un portable, ou un caméscope
Une fois que tu m'as, tu ne peux plus
t'en passer.
Je t'aime, Thomas.
Ca me rend encore fou
quand tu m'appelles comme ça.
Viens lŕ, femme.
Vous démissionnez ?
Je déménage, Tom.
Ca fait 11 ans que je suis ici.
Le secteur privé m'appelle.
Dennis Ryland m'a offert de m'associer
ŕ son cabinet de consultant.
C'est un bon job.
Donc vous déménagez en Virginie ?
Dans trois semaines.
Ecoutez, Washington m'a demandé de leur
fournir une liste de remplaçants potentiels.
Je leur en donne un.
Le vôtre.
Euh.
Eh bien, je... je suis flatté. Je, euh...
Mais vous avez besoin d'une sauvegarde ou
deux. Je veux dire, quelque part dans mon
dossier personnel il y a les mesures
de ma camisole de force.
Non, vous étiez en convalescence pour les
blessures reçues dans le cadre du service.
Votre implication dans
ce dossier était héroďque.
Je pense que vous pouvez annoncer
la nouvelle d'ici la fin de la journée.
Enfin, si vous voulez ce job.
Ow…
Une occasion de m'asseoir dans
le fauteuil du patron ?
Je le veux, ok.
Alors entraînez vous ŕ dire:
"Ravi de vous rencontrer sénateur."
C'est le meilleur moyen de vous préparer
ŕ entendre la confirmation de ceci.
J'irais m'acheter un nouveau costume.
Ma derničre action ŕ la tęte de cette
division sera de m'assurer que cela arrive.
Félicitations, Tom.
Vous l'avez mérité.
Merci.
Devine quoi.
Ne me dis rien.
Tu viens de parler ŕ Jarvis.
Tu savais ?
Elle a peut-ętre parlé de quelque chose.
Et tu ne m'as pas dit ?
Je te mute au Groenland.
Oh regarde, ce n'est męme encore confirmé
qu'il est déjŕ excité par le pouvoir.
Baldwin.
Hey, tu ne vas pas me croire.
Ils viennent juste de me demander d'intégrer
le conseil de direction du musée Collier.
Wow, c'est un sacré honneur.
Penses-tu que je devrais accepter ?
Le meilleur musée de la côte Ouest.
Tu dois accepter.
Il y a une soirée de charité au
Conseil des Arts de Seattle vendredi soir.
Ils veulent que je me présente.
Je n'ai pas encore rangé mon smoking
dans les cartons, donc, um...
On dirait qu'on a eu tous les deux
une petite surprise au bureau aujourd'hui.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Es-tu assise ?
Dis moi Thomas.
Chéri, je te vois ce soir ŕ la maison.
Glendon Ritter,
PDG de Stradwick Pharmaceuticals.
Ce n'est pas le président
du Conseil des Arts ?
Eh bien, tu devrais aller le saluer.
Tu m'accompagnes.
Non, non, vas y...
Je suis ŕ court de politesses.
Vas-y.
Mr. Ritter, je suis si heureuse
que vous ayez pu venir.
Thomas ?
Est-ce que tu la vois ?
Non.
Pourquoi ? Toi tu la vois ?
Elle a disparu pendant huit ans.
Pourquoi maintenant ?
Retourne en bas avec moi.
C'est la sortie. C'est...
C'est obligé.
Et si ça l'est...
et que tu passes cette porte...
Que va-t-il arriver ŕ tout ça ?
A nous ?
Je ne sais pas.
Et je ne veux pas savoir.
Je veux aller ŕ Washington le mois prochain,
pour te voir recevoir ta promotion.
Je veux voir qui Kyle va épouser.
Moi aussi...
Mais cette porte, elle...
Si elle est de retour,
c'est qu'il y a une raison.
C'est comme si elle voulait
que je la franchisse.
Mais toi, est-ce que tu veux la franchir ?
Je ne veux pas non plus.
Viens, Thomas.
Rentrons ŕ la maison.
Kyle !
Non ! Kyle est mon fils !
Laissez moi tranquille ! C'est mon fils !
Kyle ! Stop ! Lâchez moi !
Félicitations.
Tu as réussi.
Oů sommes-nous ?
Je pense que tu sais.
C'est ici qu'ils t'ont amené...
avec le reste des 4400.
Oui, c'est ici qu'ils nous ont changé...
qu'ils m'ont donné le pouvoir
de créer le monde
dans lequel nous avons vécu
ces 8 derničres années.
C'est donc toi.
Tu as fait ça pendant tout ce temps.
Nous avons vécu dans mon esprit,
Mais les instructions pour ta réalité
venaient d'eux.
Ils ont créé un sanctuaire pour toi.
Un monde plus facile, moins compliqué.
Mais rien de tout cela n'est réel.
Tu l'es. Je le suis.
Les sentiments que nous avons
l'un pour l'autre
sont aussi réels que tout
ce que nous avons traversé.
Est-ce pourquoi ils ont fait ça ?
Nous garder ici pendant huit ans ?
Parce qu'ils voulaient qu'on tombe amoureux ?
Quelques instants.
C'est tout ce qui s'est passé.
Mais dans ces quelques secondes, nous avons
accumulé des années de souvenirs,
qui vont nous lier dans le monde réel.
Je croyais qu'ils s'inquiétaient de sauver
le monde, pas de jouer aux entremetteurs.
Ils étaient inquiets ŕ ton sujet.
Ta vie est sur le point
de plonger dans une crise.
Ta mission sera menacée. Ils ne peuvent pas
permettre que cela arrive.
Ils t'ont donné cette relation,
comme une source de force,
pour te soutenir dans les épreuves
qui vont se présenter ŕ toi.
Quelle crise ? Qu'est...
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Pourquoi ne me disent pas
tout simplement ce que c'est ?
Je peux l'empęcher de se produire.
Elle a déjŕ commencé.
Mais désormais
tu n'auras pas ŕ l'affronter seul.
Non, si elle a commencé,
je dois retourner lŕ-bas.
Seule ta femme
peut te faire revenir chez toi.
Tu es ma femme.
Non.
Je suis une partie du programme
qu'ils ont mis dans son esprit.
Elle ne se doute pas
qu'elle a créé tout cela.
Si elle le savait, cela aurait interféré
avec votre liaison.
Quoi alors ? Je suis supposé la mettre
au courant, et qu'est-ce que je lui dis ?
Qu'elle le sache ou non, elle permet
ŕ ce monde d'exister.
Elle peut lui permettre de ne plus exister.
Oui, et si elle ne veut pas ?
Tu dois la convaincre.
Ce sera le premier test de votre relation.
Ils ont créé un bon dieu de monde
presque parfait rien que pour moi.
Et si je ne veux pas le quitter ?
Hein ?
Alors l'avenir a choisi la mauvaise personne
Non !
Non !
Et Kyle alors ?
Il a passé 9 ans ŕ devenir médecin.
Quoi ? Je suis supposé me débarrasser
de lui, le laisser s'en aller ?
Ce n'est pas vraiment Kyle.
Ne dis pas ça ! Si ce n'est pas Kyle,
qui est en train de se promener
en bas dans la cuisine ?
Kyle. Shawn. Danny. Aucun d'entre eux
n'est réel. Ils sont justes des projections.
Tu as passé 8 ans avec ces gens. Ils sont
aussi réels pour toi qu'ils le sont pour moi
J'aime ma famille.
Je les aime vraiment. Ce n'est pas comme si
j'avais envie de faire ça.
C'est ce que nous devons faire. Mais...
Ils sont ma famille aussi. Lŕ bas,
je suis juste une étrangčre pour eux.
Et pour toi et moi ? Notre vie ?
C'est une projection ça aussi ?
Non, ce que nous avons, nos souvenirs,
nous les emporterons dans le monde réel.
Mais ça ne sera pas pareil.
Ca ne pourra pas.
Peut-ętre pas.
Mais peu importe ce que nous aurons,
ce sera réel.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Fais la disparaître.
Qu'est-ce que je fais ? Je la fixe jusqu'ŕ
ce qu'elle disparaisse.
Non, persuade toi qu'elle n'est pas lŕ.
Bon, merci ŕ tous d'ętre venus.
Alana et moi voulions juste vous dire que
nous allons partir.
Nous prenons des congés. Nous serons
partis pendant un moment, et, euh...
Je sais que c'est brusque, mais nous venons
de le décider ce matin.
Quelle est la durée d'un moment ?
Je veux dire, tu viens d'avoir
la plus grosse promotion de ta carričre.
Elle devra attendre.
Nous voulions tous vous voir une derničre
fois avant de partir,
et vous dire...
combien nous vous aimions.
C'est tellement gentil.
Attention Alana. Elle va se mettre
ŕ pleurer dans une seconde.
C'est quelque chose que nous devons faire.
C'est…
C'est un voyage dont nous discutons
depuis un bon moment.
Oů est-ce que vous allez ?
Pas loin.
Bien...
Envoyez nous une carte postale... au moins.
A ceux que nous aimons.
Vous n'avez pas idée
ŕ quel point vous allez nous manquer.
Vous allez nous manquer vous aussi.
Ne regarde pas en arričre.
Tom ?
Tom ?
Es-tu avec moi, Tom ?
Peux-tu me mailer le dossier Mareva ?
Alana Mareva ?
Oui, aussi connue comme revenante 2155.
Elle était juste ici pour
son évaluation médicale.
C'est ŕ mon tour de faire les rapports
cette semaine, tu te souviens ?
Diana, les 4400, la boule de lumičre,
c'est arrivé, n'est-ce pas ?
- Devrais-je m'inquiéter pour toi...
- Dis moi juste que c'est arrivé.
Oui, bien sur que c'est arrivé.
Que veux-tu que nous ayons fait d’autre
durant cette année ?
C'est génial.
Mon dieu.
Merci. Merci.
Alana. Alana ! Alana !
Alana !
Alana, attends !
Thomas...

Pendant ces 60 derničres années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées
Elles ont été renvoyées
toutes ensemble
Sans aucun souvenir
de l'endroit oů elles étaient
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un seul jour
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des pouvoirs
Toutes tentent de se reconnecter...
... avec leur vie passée
Nous ne sommes pas la menace,
nous sommes le remčde.
Le monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans les 4400...
Autant que ce département sache,
Maia n'avait plus de visions.
Elle m'a caché ce secret,
et écrivait tout dans son journal.
C'est une citation ŕ comparaître.
- Qu'est-ce qu'ils veulent ?
- Ton journal.
Ne révčle pas ton pouvoir de guérison.
Parce que si tu guéris l'un d'entre eux,
tu devras les guérir tous.
Un jour, tout ceci sera ŕ toi.
Les papiers sont pręts.
Les avocats savent ce qu'ils ont ŕ faire.
Tout est pręt.
Il avait une vision pour préserver le futur.
et maintenant, il ne sera plus lŕ
pour nous voir l'achever.
Mais nous l'achčverons.
Rien de tout ça n'est réel pour moi non plus.
C'est ici qu'ils nous ont changé,
qu'ils m'ont donné le pouvoir de créer le monde
dans lequel nous avons vécu ces 8 derničres années.
Je t'aime, Thomas.
Donc, voyons si j'ai bien compris,
Vous vous ętes rencontrés,
vous ętes tombés amoureux l'un de l'autre, et vous avez
passé 8 ans ensemble dans une sorte de... réalité alternative,
et maintenant vous voilŕ ici, avec 8 ans
d'amour et de mariage derričre vous,
alors que pour nous il ne s'est rien passé.
Oui, ça... ça résume bien
ce qui s'est passé, oui.
Oui.
Je vais jouer le jeu.
Mais si vous commencez ŕ vous appeller
"lapin d'amour", je me casse d'ici.
Je t'avais dit qu'il essayerait, Thomas.
Comment tu savais ça ?
Eh bien, bien que tu me rencontres pour la
premičre fois, moi je sais tout ŕ ton sujet.
Tu es intelligent, ton écrivain
préféré est Alan Moore,
et ton plat favori est le pain ŕ la viande.
Mais je ne peux pas ętre tout ŕ fait le męme.
Vous avez dit qu'il n'y avait pas de 4400, ce qui signifie
pas de coma, pas de perte de temps...
Pas de problčme important. C'est exact.
Tu étais heureux. Tu avais réussi.
Ce qui veut dire ?
Rien. On parlait souvent de la
fac de médecine, tu te souviens ?
Lŕ-bas, tu es allé ŕ Stanford.
Comment j'ai fait ?
Tu as eu ton diplôme avec mention.
Tu es devenu neurologue.
Ca a dű te rendre fier.
Je suis toujours fier de toi.
Ok, mais "Dr. Kyle Baldwin" et ce monde dans lequel
vous ętiez retirés, ça venait de ton esprit, exact ?
En fait, c'était mon esprit.
Ok, mais tu l'as créé
en utilisant ses souvenirs.
Kyle, je suis aussi fier de ce que tu as
accompli ici... Plus fier encore.
Hey.
Tu veux savoir pourquoi tous les
avocats sont des crétins ?
Parce qu'ils passent leur vie
ŕ lire ces conneries.
Quelles conneries, en particulier ?
Je suis un bon interprčte.
J'ai 24 heures pour donner le
journal de Maia au NTAC,
et pas une seule option légale
pour y échapper.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Eh bien, le NTAC prend tout ce qu'il veut,
mais j'ai une fille de 9 ans ŕ la maison
qui compte sur moi pour la protéger.
Puis-je t'aider d'une certaine façon ?
Oui, tu peux me taper sur le crâne
pour avoir fait mention de ce journal.
Il n'a męme pas sauvé la vie de Collier,
et maintenant il rend la mienne un enfer.
Et si je te faisais plutôt
un bon café ?
Oh... merci.
Oui.
Est-ce que tu penses qu'ils vont
trouver celui qui a fait ça ?
Si, par "ils", tu veux dire "Thomas",
alors oui, probablement.
Mon pčre les attrape toujours.
Tu t'en vas ?
Oui, je dois garder ŕ l'esprit
que je ne vis plus ici désormais.
Ecoute, Kyle, ton pčre et moi,
nous nous aimons.
C'est génial.
Il n'y a pas assez d'amour
dans ce monde.
Mais je viens de te rencontrer.
Donne moi quelques jours avant que
je ne commence ŕ t'appeller "maman", ok ?
Tu en as déjŕ une. Je me contenterais
d'ętre une bonne amie,
et je continuerai ŕ te corrompre avec du pain
ŕ la viande jusqu'ŕ ce que je réussisse.
Bonjour, Mr. Ross.
Votre vol s'est-il bien passé ?
Oui. Merci.
Voulez-vous que je vous fasse visiter,
ou préférez-vous vous reposer ?
Ni l'un, ni l'autre.
Emmenez-moi voir Mr. Farrell.
Oui, monsieur. Par ici.
Ils attendent. Depuis 3 jours.
Dites au service publicité
que je ne suis pas encore sűr.
Ils disent qu'on a dépassé le délai.
On doit publier ce communiqué de presse.
Et c'est supposé venir de moi ?
Je n'en comprends męme pas la moitié.
Ca ne me ressemble pas, Lucy.
Changez-le alors.
Vous ętes le patron.
Oh, et le département juridique a besoin de ces
signatures maintenant, ou personne ne sera payé,
y compris le département juridique.
Je ne peux faire qu'une chose ŕ la fois.
Commençons donc avec ce communiqué.
Pourquoi ne me dicteriez-vous pas
quelque chose ?
Pas de communiqué de presse.
Si la presse veut savoir
ce que Mr. Farrell pense,
ils n'ont qu'ŕ regarder "60 Minutes",
comme le reste des Etats-Unis.
J'ai déjŕ programmé une interview exclusive
avec la nouvelle tęte des 4400.
C'est tout pour le moment.
Merci.
Je suis désolé de débarquer de cette façon. J'ai pensé que
vous pourriez avoir besoin d'un coup de main. Matthew Ross.
Oui.
Ouais.
Que  faites-vous ŕ Seattle ?
Je vais oů on a besoin de moi.
Vous ętes venu au bon endroit.
Ce n'est pas une coďncidence, Shawn.
Jordan m'a clairement fait savoir,
qu'au cas oů il mourrait,
je devais me présenter au centre
des débats, afin de vous aider.
Eh bien, encore un de ces des plans
que Jordan a omis de me faire partager.
Mais je suis content que vous soyez ici.
Jordan m'a beaucoup parlé de vous...
Il va falloir que vous engagiez
un nouveau lobbyistes.
Je m'installe dans le bureau
administratif pour le moment.
Prenez le bureau que vous voulez.
Vous commencez dčs maintenant.
Euh, ces lettres ? Tout le monde sait que
vous pouvez guérir maintenant.
Jordan avait l'intention de révéler
votre pouvoir de guérison au public,
mais il pensait le faire par étapes.
Nous n'avons plus ce luxe désormais.
On va faire avec.
Je ne peux plus sortir. Il y a des gens malades.
La presse, ils me suivent partout.
Et ils le feront
tout au long de votre vie.
Le sol vient de se dérober
sous vos pieds.
Soit vous trouvez un équilibre,
soit vous allez vous effondrez.
Le centre est devenu
le nouveau "Lourdes".
Personne ne va plus
nous traiter de secte.
Plus on refuse de gens,
plus ils sont nombreux ŕ postuler.
Dans 10 ans, ce mouvement sera la religion
la plus dominante sur cette plančte.
Arrętez.
Je suis heureux que tout aille aussi bien,
mais il y a une semaine, je n'étais qu'un gars
qui essayait de passer le dernier niveau de Doom.
Je n'étais pas le pape ŕ ce moment,
et je ne le suis toujours pas.
Si, vous l'ętes,
et vous devez commencer
ŕ vous y habituer.
Le FBI mčne la chasse de l'homme
qui a tué Jordan Collier.
Oh, mais on est encore dans le coup,
et le NTAC va gagner ŕ ce petit jeu.
Je ne veux pas que quelqu'un d'autre
se charge de nettoyer notre bordel.
Alors on ferait mieux de se dépęcher.
On sait tous que ces chasses ŕ l'homme
expirent ŕ un moment donné.
Les traces commencent ŕ disparaitre
aprčs 48 heures.
Je veux revérifier toutes les listes de pointage
des immeubles d'affaires et des parkings alentours
dans un rayon de 10 patés de maison
autour du centre.
On a déjŕ examiné soigneusement
tous ces registres.
Il va donc falloir qu'on vérifie
au delŕ de ces registres.
Le mec a abattu une personnalité
en pleine lumičre.
Il doit y avoir un témoin visuel.
Et, jusque lŕ, Tom, le seul
qui ait vu le tueur, c'est vous.
Perdant.
Perdant pathétique.
Chérie, peu importe ce que tu fais,
ne joue jamais, jamais ŕ ces jeux de hasard.
C'est nul et stupide.
Alors pourquoi est-ce que tu le fais ?
Parce que, ŕ l'inverse de ta maman, ta tante
April n'a pas des revenus confortables.
Elle est artiste, et les artistes
ont toujours besoin de liquidités,
ce qui rend la chose stupide,
parce que je perds tout le temps.
Donc, ce truc de "voir l'avenir",
ça ne marche pas qu'avec les
évenements ultra importants, hein ?
Pas toujours.
Donc, si je te demandais quel ticket...
Celui-ci.
Je vais prendre celui-lŕ.
Merci.
GAGNANT.
Bébé...
tu es mon nouveau
porte-bonheur.
Je vous retire du dossier Collier.
De quoi est-ce que vous parlez ?
On a encore la moitié des alentours ŕ quadriller.
Ca va devoir attendre.
A 10:37, heure du Pacifique,
l'agence de gestion d'urgence fédérale a envoyé
une équipe d'élite ŕ Granite Pass, Oregon,
273 habitants, oů un virus...
mortel, hautement contagieux,
et non identifié, a été libéré.
- Volatile ?
- Hmmm, oui, probablement.
- Créé par l'homme ?
- Inconnu.
Ce que nous savons, c'est que si vous
aviez dormi ŕ Granite Pass la nuit derničre,
il y a de fortes chances pour que vous
remplissiez un sac mortuaire ce matin.
Il n'y a qu'un seul habitant que l'agence de
gestion d'urgenge fédérale n'a pas pu répertorier.
Jean Delynn Baker, 30 ans.
Revenante 0188. Disparue en 1999.
Divorcée. Pas d'enfant. Le profil
psychiatrique indique qu'elle est solitaire.
Tout n'a pas été rose pour elle
depuis qu'elle est revenue.
Elle n'a pas pu se trouver de travail. Elle s'est
retrouvée au chômage 4 fois durant l'année derničre.
Et maintenant, elle est l'unique habitante de Granite
Pass, dans l'Oregon, qui n'a pas pu ętre répertoriée.
Donc on a deux possibilités.
Soit elle est immunisée contre le virus, auquel
cas on devrait l'étudier pour trouver un antidote.
Ou alors...
elle en est le porteur.
Dans les deux cas,
votre boulot reste le męme.
Utilisez toutes les ressources dont
vous avez besoin pour la retrouver.
Donc,
allez-vous me dire oů vous allez ?
Je n'ai jamais pu résister
ŕ une femme en pleurs.
Je suppose que c'est la raison pour
laquelle je ne me suis jamais marié.
Vous avez des problčmes ?
Vous fuyez votre famille ?
Vous ętes recherchée ?
Seattle. Je vais ŕ Seattle.
C'est une grande ville.
Vous voulez que je vous laisse
ŕ l'entrée de la ville ?
Je vais au centre des 4400.
Je dois aller lŕ-bas.
Pourquoi donc ?
Vous allez vous inscrire ?
Emmenez moi aussi prčs que
vous pourrez, s'il vous plait.
Si vous cherchez le salut,
vous ne le trouverez pas lŕ-bas.
Ce que vous devez faire,
c'est vous adonner...
ŕ votre vrai seigneur et sauveur.
Le jour de la purification arrive.
Il y a des signes partout...
La pestilence, la peste.
A qui le dites vous.
Je me suis révéillée dans une ville pleine
de morts ce matin... ma mčre
mon pčre...
tout... tout le monde.
Ouais ?
Comment ça se fait que
vous ayez survécu ?
Je pense que
j'en suis peut-ętre la cause.
Vous ?
Maintenant vous vous foutez de moi.
Ok, allez-y,
moquez vous du fou de dieu,
mais, je vous le dis, le monde entier
sera bientôt purifié.
Ecoutez, je ne pense pas que vous soyez
fou, monsieur. A vrai dire, je crois...
tout ce que vous dites.
Les yeux et les ongles ne sont que légčrement
décolorés. Il n'y a presque pas de rigidité cadavérique.
Qu'est-ce que
les autopsies ont montré ?
Rien sur lequel
on puisse mettre un nom.
Leurs organes internes sont liquéfiés, en quelque
sorte. Cette chose fait effet rapidement.
Donc, vous venez d'enlever votre casque...
vous avez envie de mourir ?
Le virus est libéré, s'échappe dans l'air,
puis se dissipe en moins d'une demi-heure.
- Vous en avez vu assez ?
- Beaucoup.
Donc, toutes les personnes qu'on a vu ce matin sont mortes
parce qu'elles se trouvaient dans le rayon d'origine du virus ?
Oui, s'ils avaient débarqué en ville une heure
plus tard, elles se porteraient bien.
C'est quelque chose de toute façon,
mais Orson Bailey, Trent Applebaum...
quand le pouvoir d'un 4400 se manifeste,
il peut s'intensifier rapidement.
Ce qui signifie que, si Jean Delynn Baker
transmet le virus...
Oui, ce n'est peut-ętre qu'un début.
<i>Les médecins ont dit qu'ils ne pouvaient
stopper la croissance de mon cancer...</i>
<i>Et j'ai travaillé dur pendant toute ma vie, mais la tuberculose
a épuisé nos économies, et ma femme bien-aimée...</i>
<i>Mamy m'a dit de prier, donc quand
je vous ai vu ŕ la télé, j'ai su...</i>
<i>- que vous m'aideriez.
- S'il vous plait.</i>
Shawn ? C'est Lucy.
Il est prévu que vous vous adressiez
aux nouveaux diplomés. Tout le monde attend.
Shawn ?
Oui, je suis flattée. Je ne suis pas sűre de pouvoir
assumer un travail ŕ l'heure actuelle.
Richard va pas mal voyager.
Ici, la garderie est de premičre ordre
et complčtement gratuite.
Eh bien, dans un sens, je ne suis pas sűre
d'avoir les qualifications requises.
Je veux dire, assistante du directeur
des ressources humaines ?
J'ai eu ma premičre fille en sortant du lycée.
Mon CV entier peut tenir sur une demie-page.
Vous ętes une 4400.
Ca équivaut ŕ un diplôme
de troisičme cycle par ici.
De plus, Jordan m'a parlé de vous.
Oh, ça j'en suis sűre.
Il a dit que vous aviez un don d'empathie,
que vous étiez une organisatrice née,
et que vous aviez le chic
pour tirer le meilleur des gens.
Jordan  a dit ça de moi ?
Vous ętes une revenante.
Vous ętes intelligente.
Nous donnons des responsabilités
aux gens comme vous par ici.
Essuyez vos pieds.
Un virus mortel volatile a été libéré, et tu
t'inquičtes ŕ propos de traces de pas boueuses ?
Ca reste la maison de quelqu'un.
Donc c'est ici que vivait
Jean Delynn Baker.
Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'elle s'enfuisse, ouais.
Est-ce qu'elle a un agenda ?
Un genre de planning quotidien ?
Oui, mais je pense qu'il s'est évaporé quand elle s'est
rendu compte que la ville toute entičre avait été anéantie.
Personne n'a contacté les parents ?
C'est leur maison. Ils dormaient ŕ l'étage
quand le virus a frappé.
Ok, les gars, vous ne quittez pas cette maison
jusqu'ŕ ce que vous ayez tout passé au peigne fin,
lettres, factures de téléphone,
listes de courses. Marco, écoute moi.
Trouve moi des caractčristiques particulčres,
la maničre dont elle pense.
Elle est en fuite. Je veux arriver avant elle,
peu importe oů elle se dirige.
Flirt.
T'as entendu le monsieur.
Centre des 4400. Comment puis-je
diriger votre appel ?
Je ne voulais pas faire ça.
Je ne voulais pas les tuer. Je...
ces... ces cloques
elles me démangent tellement.
- Tuer qui ?
- J'ai besoin que vous m'aidiez, s'il vous plait.
Qui est-ce ?
Je suis une 4400, et il y a quelque
chose qui ne va pas chez moi.
Tout le monde meurt autour de moi, et je ne sais pas
comment l'arręter. Je ne sais pas comment l'arręter.
Dites moi votre nom et le lieu
oů vous vous trouvez.
Combien de gens sont morts ?
Elle a dit des centaines, mais
ils n'en parlent pas aux infos.
Il se pourrait qu'ils essaient d'étouffer l'affaire,
et il y a une 4400 nommée Jean Baker ?
Elle a dit qu'elle restait dans un motel prčs
de la sortie de Squirrel Hill sur la route 65.
Passez moi le NTAC au téléphone.
Ouais ! Tu avais raison.
Philadelphie les a rétamé !
Combien as-tu gagné ?
$200 pour tante April.
Tout ça grâce ŕ toi,
mon petit génie.
Maintenant, il me faut Chicago
contre New York, assez équilibré.
Chicago joue ŕ domicile,
ce qui leur donne un avantage,
mais New York reste sur
une série de trois victoires.
Donc, qu'est-ce que tu choisis ?
Combien tu paries ?
Les 200 dollars,
ce qui ne sera pas assez pour que je prenne ma retraite,
mais il faut bien que je commence quelque part.
Alors, tu vois quelque chose ?
Est-ce  que tu m'aimes ?
C'est quoi cette question ?
Je veux dire, m'aimer pour moi-męme...
ou parce que je te dis des
trucs qui vont se passer ?
Chérie, écoute.
Je t'aime pour ce que tu es,
pas pour ce que tu peux faire.
Toujours.
Ok ?
Je choisirais Chicago.
Chicago alors.
Maintenant, viens. Tante April
va t'emmener manger une pizza.
Va te nettoyer, et
enlčve les trucs de ta mčre.
Tu sais qu'elle
se crispe vite ŕ propos...
Maia.
C'est la bague de fiançaille de ma mčre.
Oů l'as tu trouvée ?
Je joue toujours avec.
Cette bague a beaucoup de valeur,
ce qui veut dire qu'elle n'est pas faite
pour que les petites filles jouent avec.
Maintenant lave-toi bien,
ou je commande des anchois. Vas y.
Salut.
Salut.
Ne le prends pas mal,
mais comment es-tu rentrée ici ?
Ton pčre m'a donné une clé.
Un peu tôt pour diner, non ?
Tôt pour manger.
Pas pour préparer.
Tu sais cuisiner ?
Désolé, je suis un neurochirurgien
de classe mondiale, pas un chef.
Mais je peux vider un sac de courses
mieux que personne.
Mais je dois t'avertir,
tu ignores la rčgle n°1 de papa.
Qui est ?
Plus tu passes de temps et d'attention
ŕ préparer une fęte de famille...
plus il y a de chances
qu'elle ne se produise pas.
Je suppose que tu connais
bien le bonhomme.
Ce qui signifie que tu me connais aussi,
ce qui, je suis désolé, est vraiment bizarre.
Tu dois admettre que c'est
un peu étrange pour moi aussi.
Nous avons une relation de 8 ans,
et je dois garder ŕ l'esprit
qu'elle n'existe pas vraiment.
Alors, dis moi, est-ce que j'étais, genre
le premier de la classe en fac de médecine ?
En quoi est-ce important, Kyle ?
Tu n'es pas en compétition
avec toi-męme.
Je suis juste curieux.
Eh bien tu ramčnes
tout le temps ce sujet.
C'est plus que de la curiosité.
Et alors, si ça l'est ?
Si tu savais qu'il y avait un univers parallčle oů se promčne
une version de toi-męme meilleure et plus intelligente,
comment te sentirais-tu ?
Il n'était ni meilleur,
ni plus intelligent. C'était toi.
Il  a juste eu des options
que je n'aurai jamais.
Pas de 4400, pas de coma.
Il a pu aller en fac de médecine.
Qui dit que tu n'as pas
cette option ?
J'ai 21 ans, je suis en seconde.
Tu as commencé un peu en retard. Tu continues
de penser que je connais deux Kyles. C'est faux.
Je ne connais que toi.
Tu veux ętre médecin ?
Je sais de source sűre que tu peux réussir
les tests d'admission en fac de médecine.
Jean Baker est dans un motel
ŕ 16 kilomčtres de lŕ.
A l'heure actuelle, la moitié du NTAC se dirige
lŕ-bas. Mortimer et Falcone doivent déjŕ y ętre.
C'est bizarre, hein ? Répondre ŕ un tuyau
venant du centre des 4400 ?
Shawn m'a dit qu'il voulait
coopérer avec nous.
Je suppose qu'il était sérieux.
Pardon, on est du NTAC.
On a besoin de passer.
Je vais vous faire passer.
Alors, qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
Un chauffeur routier mort.
On suppose une mort subite.
Jean Delynn Baker ?
Non, non, non, que faites-vous ?
Je vous ai appellés ŕ l'aide.
On sait. Venez avec nous.
Vous m'effrayez, arrętez, s'il vous plait. Ca commence
ŕ me démanger quand j'ai peur. S'il vous plait,
éloignez vous de moi !
Mon dieu.
Ce chauffeur est mort
il y a moins de 3 heures.
Ouais, et il n'a pas pu prendre
Jean plus de 2 heures avant.
Ce qui signifie qu'il a été exposé,
infecté, et tué, en quoi, 120 minutes.
C'est plus rapide que
tous les virus que j'ai vu.
Mortimer et Falcone.
On dirait qu'on joue les renforts. Baldwin.
Ce n'est pas ma faute.
Qui est ŕ l'appareil ?
J'ai appelé pour de l'aide. Vous avez envoyé
du gaz lacrymogčne dans ma chambre !
Jean Baker ?
Comment vous avez eu
le téléphone de Mortimer ?
Comment est-ce que
vous croyez que je l'ai eu ?
Ils m'ont fait peur.
Ils sont venus frapper ŕ ma porte.
Qu'est-ce que vous leur avez fait ?
Je suppose que vous avez cru que leurs combinaisons
les protégeraient ? Eh bien, vous aviez tort,
Ok ? Personne n'est ŕ l'abri.
C'est pourquoi je vous mets en garde...
Restez loin de moi, ok ?
Laissez tout le monde ŕ distance.
- Oů ętes-vous ?
- Je roule.
Je pense qu'elle a pris leur voiture.
Appelle Jarvis. Qu'elle la mette sous surveillance.
Jean, dites-moi oů vous ętes,
oů vous allez. On veut vous aider.
Non, j'ai déjŕ essayé ça.
Personne ne peut m'aider, personne n'a jamais pu.
Pourquoi ce serait différent maintenant ?
Je sais que vous ne voulez
tuer personne,
mais écoutez moi, le virus qui se développe
en vous est incroyablement mortel.
J'ai toujours été toxique, j'ai empoisonné
toutes les relations que j'ai eu.
C'est différent.
Oui, ils l'ont rendu réel.
Mes parents disaient toujours que
j'étais une catastrophe ambulante.
Ils n'auront jamais l'occasion de voir
ŕ quel point ils avaient raison.
Jean, ça n'est pas obligé de se passer comme ça.
Si vous voulez que tout s'arręte, c'est possible.
Trouvez un endroit désert, garez-vous,
et attendez qu'on vienne vous retrouver.
Je n'ai pas besoin de vous.
Je peux prendre soin de moi-męme.
Qu'allez vous faire ?
Je vais mettre fin ŕ ça
avant de tuer quelqu'un d'autre.
Mettre fin ŕ quoi ?
Cet appel, cette journée, tout.
Non, Jean, attendez.
Ne raccrochez pas. Ecoutez moi.
Adieu, baldwin.
Elle a dit qu'elle allait se tuer.
Je ne crois pas que ce soit la solution. Ça
pourrait déclencher une autre diffusion du virus.
Est-ce qu'on l'a localisée ?
Oui, elle roule vers l'ouest sur la route 99.
Jarvis a mis 3 hélicos sur le coup.
Si elle ne se gare pas,
ils ont ordre de l'incinérer.
Des vacances ?
Pour combien de temps ?
Un mois, peut-ętre deux.
Je ne sais pas.
Vous croyez que le centre, le mouvement,
a besoin de ça en ce moment ?
Je ne sais pas Matthew, mais je suis sűr
d'en avoir besoin maintenant.
Je crois que vous allez vous contenter
d'un long week-end.
On m'a dit que
Puget Sound était sympa.
Ok, vous ne m'écoutez pas.
Je vous ignore.
Il y a une différence.
Ecoutez.
Je ne dis pas que
je ne peux pas le faire.
Je dirigerai ce mouvement.
Mais Jordan
vient juste de mourir,
et j'ai besoin de temps
pour m'y faire.
Vous allez devoir faire votre deuil
rapidement, comme nous tous.
Ça s'appelle ętre un adulte.
Ne me faites pas la morale
au sujet de mes responsabilités.
Vous venez d'arriver ici,
et si cet endroit a besoin de moi,
comme vous le répétez,
alors il va devoir faire
en fonction de moi.
En fonction de vous ?
On peut faire ça.
Mary O'Connell. Enlevée en 1972.
Empathie trčs prometteuse.
Robert Fields, 1987. Génie des nombres
et de la classification statistique.
- John Gersten...
- Qui sont ces gens ?
Des remplaçants potentiels.
Aucun d'entre eux n'aurait le męme impact que vous, mais
je suis décidé ŕ faire avancer le centre, avec ou sans vous.
Jordan avait l'habitude de me parler
comme ça parfois. Il était doué pour...
me faire voir les choses
de son point de vue.
Vous ?
Vous n'y ętes pas encore.
Votre pouvoir de guérison
vous rend unique.
Jordan le savait.
Je le croyais.
Je suis venu ici travailler avec vous,
mais vous me demandez de faire en
fonction de vous, et ça, je ne peux pas.
Alors, vous allez devoir passer pas mal
de temps ŕ bien étudier cette liste,
parce que je m'en vais.
Je suis certain que vous n'hésiterez
pas longtemps cependant.
Je sais qu'il y a une forte demande
pour la classification statistique.
C'est impossible.
Mortimer et Falcone portaient un
équipement anti-biologique dernier cri.
Ce truc a été élaboré pour résister
a une attaque d'anthrax.
Ils sont morts, Marco.
Apparemment, ce qu'elle libére
est un peu plus mesquin que l'anthrax.
Si ça passe au travers de ces combinaisons, ça veut
dire que l'antigčne opčre ŕ un niveau sub-atomique.
Ce qui le rend
pratiquement inarrętable.
Ouais, ŕ peu prčs.
Jean m'a dit que Mortimer et Falcone
l'avaient effrayée. Est-ce possible...
que la diffusion du virus
soit liée ŕ son état émotionnel ?
Plus que possible,
c'est fort probable.
Sa pharmacie ressemble ŕ une enseigne lumineuse
affichant "troubles de la personnalité borderline".
Elle a des crčmes ŕ la cortisone
pour l'urticaire dű au stress,
un assortiment des
meilleurs psychotropes...
Xanax, Prozac...
Ouais, on a compris, Marco.
C'est une loque humaine.
Une loque humaine dont le corps agit comme un systčme
de distribution pour le virus qu'elle produit...
de la męme maničre que les fleurs
répandent leur pollen.
Quoi ? Elle émet des spores ?
Un truc dans le genre.
Ecoutez, les spores ne sont que des entités
reproductives émises par un systčme vasculaire.
Le corps humain est
un gros systčme vasculaire.
Qui fonctionne grâce
ŕ la circulation sanguine.
Oui, qui peut accélérer ou ralentir,
suivant l'humeur ou les sensations.
Donc quand la circulation sanguine de Jean s'accélčre,
qu'elle soit en colčre, confuse, contrariée,
peu importe... le virus mortel
se répand dans l'air.
On arrive ŕ sa voiture, Marco.
Un conseil pour la gérer au mieux ?
Euh... Ne l'énervez pas ?
- Salut.
- Salut.
Comment allez vous, Lily ?
Bien.
J'ai entendu que tu partais
quelques temps.
C'était rapide.
Peu importe... Ouais, je ne sais pas
combien de temps je serai parti.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Pour commencer,
je vais disparaître un moment,
et aprčs, hum,
je ne sais pas, qui sait ?
Je veux dire, je n'ai pas ŕ travailler ici,
ŕ guérir les gens, donc...
je pense que je pourrais
aller n'importe oů.
Donc tu vas juste parcourir
la plančte, style "kung fu" ?
Je ne vais pas me raser le crâne, ni porter une
robe... mais oui, quelque chose dans le genre.
Eh bien tu pourrais
emmener ça avec toi,
regarder les adresses d'expédition...
t'arręter ŕ Gloucester, Massachusetts,
guérir quelqu'un rapidement,
et continuer ton chemin.
Tu es au courant pour les lettres ?
Shawn, il y en a partout.
Chacune plus triste que la précédente.
C'est plus que tu ne peux faire.
Ca m'a donné une idée, cependant,
mais, tu sais, tu pars,
donc on en reparlera ŕ ton retour.
Non, Lily,
je veux dire, comme je l'ai dit, je ne sais pas
quand je reviendrai, donc je t'en prie,
j'adorerais entendre
ce que tu as ŕ dire.
Trčs bien, donc, j'ai pensé...
je veux dire, nous ne sommes pas un hôpital,
et nous ne sommes pas une oeuvre de bienfaisance.
et pourtant, des milliers de ces demandes.
continuent d'affluer chaque jour,
Ce n'est pas étonnant que tu te sentes submergé.
Nous ne sommes pas préparés ŕ ça.
Oui, exactement, c'est pour ça
que je dois partir d'ici.
Et si on montait une fondation ?
Une partie du centre, mais séparée.
Engager du personnel dont l'unique travail
serait d'ouvrir ces lettres et
trouver les cas
qui en ont le plus besoin,
les gens que personne n'a pu aider,
mais que nous pouvons aider.
Mais ça revient ŕ dire non
ŕ des milliers de personnes.
C'est exact, Shawn, mais
si on pouvait dire oui ŕ une ?
Je veux dire, tu guéris
une personne par jour,
chaque jour.
Ca reste un sacré travail...
de décider de qui le mérite plus.
Eh bien, tu formes un comité avec
des médecins et
des assistantes sociales.
Et toi.
Oh. Bien...
Allez, je veux dire, c'est ton idée, tu devrais
au moins ętre lŕ pour faire en sorte que ça se fasse.
Oui, je viens de prendre un boulot
aux ressources humaines.
Je pense pouvoir
te transférer, probablement.
Avez trouvé le corps ŕ l'interieur ?
On ne peut pas
s'approcher encore assez.
Dčs que vous pouvez,
on a besoin de le récupérer.
Elle a dit vouloir en finir.
Di'...
Je suppose qu'on peut renvoyer Marco et
ses gars ŕ la base, les laisser chercher
l'effet domino, sur ce cas lŕ.
Pardon.
Baldwin.
J'y étais presque, mais...
- Je ne sais pas...
- Jean ?
Je ne pouvais pas le faire.
C'est bien, personne ne vous veut morte.
Dites moi juste oů vous ętes.
Non, vous ne pouvez pas m'aider.
Le centre des 4400 ne peut pas
non plus, mais qu'importe.
Je sais enfin oů
je suis supposée aller.
Dites moi oů.
Je vous retrouve lŕ-bas.
Vous avez déjŕ lu la bible,
Baldwin ?
Je suis allé au catéchisme.
J'ai passé du temps dessus
tout ŕ l'heure, au motel.
"Le temps est ŕ portée de main".
C'est "Révélations", n'est-ce pas ?
Mais en connaissez-vous la signification ?
Je parie que non.
Voyez,
ces cloques...
elles se forment sur ma main.
Vous comprenez ?
Je ne suis pas sűr, Jean.
Ils parlent de moi dans ce livre.
Vous avez une famille ?
Jean, de quoi
est-ce que vous parlez ?
Allez les voir.
Serrez les fort dans vos bras. J'ai finalement
compris pourquoi ils m'ont renvoyé.
Je fais partie de leur plan,
ils veulent que je le fasse.
Faire quoi ?
Purifier l'humanité.
Elle a cité "révélation" ?
Ce n'est jamais un bon signe, Tom.
Elle voulait qu'on l'aide, elle voulait arręter tout ça
et maintenant elle croit ętre la fin du monde,
Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ?
Elle a dit qu'ils voulaient
qu'elle fasse ça ?
Eh bien, ça implique que
ce n'est plus entre ses mains.
La destinée.
Elle se dégage des responsabilités.
Oui, c'est une maničre de gérer le fait d'ętre un
fléau ambulant... prétendre ne pas pouvoir décider.
Je ne crois pas qu'elle veuille y repenser.
Je crois qu'elle veut juste en finir.
C'est son état d'esprit.
Ça ne nous dit toujours pas oů elle va.
Elle est sur pilotage
automatique, Tom.
Tu sais ce que je crois ?
Elle fait ce qu'elle voulait faire avant que
les cadavres ne commencet ŕ s'empiler.
Oui, Marco.
Aujourd'hui on est mardi, hein ?
On est mercredi, Marco.
Excuse.
Elle n'a écrit qu'une seule chose
pour cette journée.
Elle a rempli une demande
de recherche d'emploi
dans le centre ville de Portland.
Enfoiré !
Je n'y crois pas.
Je ręve, ou ne m'as tu pas dit
que Chicago gagnerait ?
Tu sais ce que j'ai parié ?
200$.
La bague de fiançailles
en diamant de ma mčre,
et maintenant je ne l'ai plus,
tout ça parce que je t'ai cru,
je t'ai fait confiance,
et tu m'as laissé tomber.
Tu m'as menti.
Tu as dit que gagner
n'était pas important.
Que tu m'aimerais quand męme.
Alors tu savais que Chicago
allait perdre, n'est-ce pas ?
Depuis le début,
ce n'était qu'un test.
Une fondation ?
Ne pensez vous pas
qu'on a déjŕ assez ŕ faire ?
C'est une personne par jour. Une fois que ce sera pręt et
en marche, ça ne prendra pas beaucoup de mon temps.
Je croyais que vous
cherchiez un peu d'intimité.
En faisant ça, vous allez ętre
sous les projecteurs.
Oui, mais ce sont mes conditions.
Une bonne publicité.
Pas trop dur ŕ mettre en marche.
On pourrait trouver des grands noms
pour ce comité de filtrage.
Je pense que c'est une bonne idée.
Je suis content que vous approuviez,
mais je ne demandais pas
vraiment votre permission.
Je n'en espérais pas moins.
Jean.
Baldwin ?
Exact.
Vous auriez dű rester éloigné.
Regardez autour de vous.
Tous ces gens,
ils n'ont rien fait pour vous blesser.
Ils n'ont rien fait
pour m'aider non plus.
De plus, ça n'a pas d'importance. Je n'ai pas
le choix. Je fais ce qu'ils voulaient que je fasse.
Vous n'ętes pas obligée d'accepter ça.
Vous avez le choix.
Oui, comme j'ai eu le choix
quand on m'a enlevée.
Je n'ai jamais eu le choix.
Jamais.
Ils ont pris la fille
adéquate pour ce boulot.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici, de toute façon ? Vous auriez dű
retourner auprčs de votre famille, comme je vous l'avais dit.
Non. Je suis juste
oů je voulais ętre.
Alors vous devez
avoir envie de mourir.
Vous pensez ętre ici pour tuer des gens.
Je pense ętre ici pour vous arręter.
Ils vous ont infecté, Jean,
et c'était mal,
mais vous n'ętes pas obligée de les laisser
faire de vous une meurtričre massive.
Je suis déjŕ une tueuse.
Non. Non. Vous n'avez pas décidé de tuer qui que
ce soit. Mais c'est ce que vous faites ŕ cet instant.
Peu importe ce que vous pensez au sujet de la
destinée ou de la foi, peu importe... Vous avez tort.
Vous n'ętes pas obligée de faire ça.
Vous n'ętes pas obligée.
Vous voulez entendre
un truc marrant ? Je...
je vous crois.
Mais il est trop tard.
Oh... elles sont trop développées.
Je ne peux plus
l'arręter maintenant.
Elles me démangent tellement.
C'est vrai.
Sacrée journée.
Comment tu tiens le coup ?
Eh bien...
j'ai un rendez-vous avec
le conseiller psychiatrique lundi.
J'ai sauvé des milliers d'innocents,
mais j'ai dű abattre une femme pour ça...
Tu as fait ce que tu devais faire.
En tout cas, euh,
je ne suis pas sűr que ce soit le bon moment,
mais je t'ai fait un petit truc.
C'est un genre de...
eh bien, une version falsifiée du journal de Maia.
Ca devrait tromper ŕ peu prčs tout le monde.
Tu as bricolé ça pour que
le NTAC me laisse tranquille ?
Je sais que c'est un gros truc, mais
tu étais en quelque sorte ŕ leur merci, donc...
Ca pourrait m'attirer beaucoup de problčmes.
Ca pourrait t'attirer beaucoup de problčmes.
Oui, euh, tu n'es pas obligée
de l'utiliser si tu ne veux pas.
Je te donne juste une option.
C'est fou.
C'est peut-ętre aussi une des choses les plus
gentilles qu'on ait jamais faite pour moi.
Je voudrais vous remercier
pour le travail bien fait.
Vous avez dű ętre trčs persuasive.
J'ai juste dit ce que je pensais.
Votre idée de fondation était géniale.
Vous voulez dire votre idée,
n'est-ce pas ?
Est-ce qu'on doit
garder ça secret ?
Vous et Shawn avez eu tous deux ce que vous vouliez,
et beaucoup de gens malades vont recevoir de l'aide.
Eh bien, vous avez fait beaucoup
pour le centre aujourd'hui,
et je ne l'oublierai pas.
Hey, Matthey,
vous savez ce que le centre
représente pour moi ?
Quoi ?
Loyer gratuit et
garderie pour ma fille.
Je ne suis pas une gamine de 18 ans. Je n'ai pas
besoin de me découvrir un pouvoir magique.
Donc, en d'autres termes...
vous n'ętes pas une vraie croyante ?
Est-ce un problčme ?
Pas du tout.
Moi non plus.
Tu as l'air lessivé.
Ouais, ne m'en parle pas.
Tu n'étais pas obligée de faire ça.
Eh bien, ce n'est pas moi.
C'est ton fils qui a cuisiné.
Kyle ?
Je parie qu'on lui a filé
un coup de main.
Eh bien, tu sais, on a pu discuter.
C'était sympa.
Comment s'est passée ta journée, Alana ?
Eh bien, j'ai acheté ces objets de ce jeune artiste, cette fille
de Bed-Stuy, (Bedford-Stuyvesant, quartier de New York)
autodidacte, et elle a peint
ce bout de jardin
dans son arričre-cour, oů il fait nuit,
et le ciel est tellement riche,
et profond...
Vous allez bien ?
Plus ou moins.
Je parie que vous aviez presque oublié.
Non,
mais je pensais, étant donné les évenements
du jour, vous donner un petit délai.
Eh bien, ce n'est pas nécessaire.
C'est une bonne lecture.
Plein de trucs sympa
sur Bob l'Eponge.
Merci.
le NTAC a travaillé en collaboration
avec les services policiers locaux et nationaux
dans l'enquęte du meurtre de Jordan Collier...
Bien qu'aucune arrestation n'a encore été effectuée,
le NTAC affirme que des progrčs ont été réalisés...
Les déclarations officielles des fédéraux indiquent que l'enquęte prend
une direction positive et sont confiants qu'elle va mener ŕ l'arr..
Ses yeux étaient plus étroits.
Oui, c'est lui.
Sa bouche était plus plate,
pas trčs souriante.
C'est lui.

Pendant ces 60 derničres années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées
Elles ont été renvoyées
toutes ensemble
Sans aucun souvenir
de l'endroit oů elles étaient
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un seul jour
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des pouvoirs
Toutes tentent de se reconnecter...
... avec leur vie passée
Nous ne sommes pas la menace,
nous sommes le remčde.
Le monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans les 4400...
Tu te souviens de moi ?
Nikki ? Tu es la seule chose de bien qui
me soit arrivée depuis que je suis rentré.
Dan...oh !
Danny !
Danny !
Arręte de m'en vouloir pour Nikki !
Shawn, arręte !
Tu es en train de le tuer !
Donc, tout ce truc de "voir l'avenir",
C'est pas seulement
pour les trucs importants, si ?
Pas toujours.
Celui-ci.
Fillette, tu es mon nouveau
porte bonheur.
Tu sais ce que j'ai parié ?
La bague de fiançailles en diamant de ma mčre.
Et maintenant, je l'ai perdue.
Tu as dit que c'était pas de gagner qui comptait.
Tu as dit que tu m'aimais.
- Tout ça n'était qu'un test...
- Et tu as échoué.
Ca ne me ressemble pas, Lucy.
Alors modifiez-le. C'est vous le patron.
- Matthew Ross.
- Oui.
Jordan a bien spécifié qu'en cas de décčs,
je devais me présenter au Centre pour vous aider.
Le sol viens de se dérober
sous vos pieds.
Soit vous trouvez un équilibre,
soit vous tomberez sur vos fesses.
Le fait est que, tous ceux qui vivent
aujourd'hui, le doivent ŕ Jordan Collier.
Il avait la perspective de sauver le futur.
Tu as attendu dans le couloir devant
mon appartement la nuit derničre.
Je ne sais pas comment j'ai atterri lŕ. S'il te plait,
crois-moi. J'ai encore eu un trou noir la nuit derničre.
Kyle ?
Kyle !
Ouais, je suis lŕ. Attends une seconde.
Il est 8h10. Tu ne vas pas en cours ?
Je suppose que mon réveil n'a pas marché.
Tu ferais mieux de te dépęcher.
Ton 1er cours commence ŕ 9h les mardis, non ?
- Hé.
- Hé.
Tu ne veux quand męme pas que je te donne du speed ?
Allez. Il est temps de se bouger. Allons-y.
Alana a appelé la nuit derničre.
J'avais oublié de te le dire.
Elle est ŕ Barcelone, Kyle.
On a seulement 20 minutes pour se parler
quand on est tous les 2 réveillés.
Un message ?
Oui, elle... elle, euh...
Elle a acheté quelques tableaux
pour sa galerie, et tu lui manques.
La prochaine fois qu'elle appelle
pendant que je suis absent...
Oui, oui, j'essaierai de m'en souvenir.
Je dois me préparer, ok ?
Ok, mais je ne peux pas t'attendre.
Tu vas devoir prendre le bus.
Et arręte de laisser traîner ta serviette
sur le sol de la salle de bain, ok ?
<i>La chasse au tueur s'intensifie.</i>
Ben ?
Tyler ? Mon Dieu, tu n'as pas changé.
50 ans de vacances auraient
le męme effet sur toi.
- Tu m'as l'air...
- J'ai l'air vieux.
Particuličrement ŕ côté de toi.
J'avais 8 mois de plus que toi.
La derničre fois que je t'ai vu, c'était...
Sous une tente, ŕ la sortie
de Sinanju, en Corée.
Le 11 mai 1951.
Tu te souviens de cette date.
Parfois j'ai du mal ŕ me souvenir
de l'anniversaire de mes petits-enfants
mais ça c'est un jour
que je n'oublierai jamais.
Lee t'a frappé, et toi...
Je ne sais pas, tu as disparu.
Alors,
qu'est-ce que tu fais ici, Ben ?
Tu te souviens de Milton Weinberg,
ton vieil ailier ?
Milt a été le premier ŕ m'inviter ŕ s'asseoir
ŕ sa table au mess des officiers.
Il vient de mourir.
La maladie de Parkinson.
Je suis désolé. Je sais que
vous étiez proches tous les 2.
Et je suis sűr qu'il aurait voulu
que tu sois lŕ ŕ ses funérailles.
Est-ce que...
Lee sera lŕ ?
On t'a traité comme un des nôtres
mais c'était pas encore assez pour toi.
Il a fallu que tu dépasses les limites.
Aucun d'entre nous n'a parlé
ŕ Lee depuis des années.
Je serai lŕ...
par respect pour Milt.
Est-ce qu'il va bien ?
Mieux que bien.
Rythme cardiaque,
respiration,
réflexes...
Tous sont au dessus la moyenne.
Dites bonjour ŕ votre enfant
en bonne santé.
Edwin, je...
Je ne pourrais męme pas
trouver les mots.
Comment vous remercier ?
Et on lui dira tout sur vous,
l'infirmier qui a changé sa vie.
Profitez bien de votre fils,
M. et Mme Ward.
Prenez soin de lui.
Edwin, vous avez une seconde ?
Désolé, docteur.
Je suis attendu ŕ l'infirmerie.
Ca pourra attendre.
Je veux savoir ce que
vous avez fait au bébé Ward.
On  avait fait une amniocentčse
au premier trimestre.
On avait diagnostiqué ŕ ce bébé
un syndrome de Prader-Willi.
Peut-ętre  qu'il y a eu
une erreur dans les tests.
Vous avez vu ces résultats, Edwin.
Le  15čme chromosome était endommagé.
Cela induisait un retard mental sévčre ŕ la naissance,
mais leur enfant vient d'obtenir 9
au test Apgar (sur 10).
En général, un miracle amčne une fęte,
pas une inquisition.
C'est la 4čme fois que ça arrive
ces 6 derniers mois.
Dans chacun de ces cas,
vous étiez l'infirmier assistant.
Et vous ętes un 4400.
Je ne suis pas sűr de voir le rapport.
Tout le monde a entendu parler de ce jeune
homme qui dirige le Centre 4400 désormais.
Ils disent qu'il a guéri des maladies
comme la sclérose,
des maladies qu'aucun hôpital
au monde ne peut guérir.
C'est un guérisseur.
Tout comme vous.
Dans mon cas,
ça ne marche qu'in utero.
Je peux sentir les dégâts
dans leurs chromosomes.
Je ne suis pas sur de savoir
comment ça marche exactement, mais
malgré ça, je peux les réparer.
C'est incroyable.
Dr. Hodler, si ça ne vous fait rien,
je préférerais travailler anonymement.
Il y a déjŕ des rumeurs de naissances
miraculeuses dans cet hôpital, Edwin.
Et les gens parlent.
Je ne pense pas que vous allez
pouvoir conserver ce privilčge.
Attends une minute.
C'est la déposition de Gavin Mar que j'ai déjŕ lue hier.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'ils renvoient ça ici ?
Peut-ętre qu'on a manqué quelque chose.
Il y avait un millier de personnes ŕ la fęte
quand Collier a été assassiné.
Tu ne penses pas qu'ils auraient au moins pu
nous envoyer des fichiers inutiles, mais nouveaux ?
Une piste sérieuse lŕ dedans ?
Je plaisantais.
Je vous enlčve l'affaire Collier
pour le moment.
Pour quelque chose d'important, j'espčre.
Un des dossiers dans les rapports
du matin a attiré mon attention.
Il y a un chat sur Internet
pour les femmes enceintes.
Hier, quelqu'un a lancé un post sur des guérisons
inexpliquées de défauts de naissance ŕ l'hôpital Mercy.
Alors vous nous arrachez l'affaire Collier
pour enquęter sur des internautes qui chattent ?
Il y a un 4400 qui travaille dans cet hôpital.
Bingo.
Edwin Mayuya. Il est né au Rwanda.
Alors ce type est une sorte de guérisseur ?
Selon Internet. Ne vous inquiétez pas,
vous ętes toujours le mâle dominant.
Ce n'est pas ŕ ça que je pensais.
C'est super s'il l'est, bien sűr.
On devrait l'inviter au Centre.
La moindre des choses serait
d'offrir ŕ M. Mayuya une entrevue.
Trčs bien, organisez-lŕ.
Je serai lŕ.
Pourquoi ne me laisseriez-vous pas
m'occuper de l'accueil et de la rencontre ?
Je verrai bien s'il y a du vrai
dans ces histoires.
En męme temps, il y a un geste dont
j'aimerais que vous considériez l'opportunité.
Considérez-le comme la phase suivante
de votre développement en tant que leader.
Matthew, je vous ai dit que je lirais
l'Art de la Guerre, d'accord ?
Je voudrais que
vous appeliez votre mčre.
Je sais que Jordan vous avait conseillé
de garder vos distances avec votre famille.
Avant męme que Jordan dise quoi que ce soit,
ma famille avait déjŕ pris ses distances avec moi.
Les relations familiales
sont... complexes.
Je ne pense pas qu'un simple coup de fil
nous mčnerait ŕ un gros câlin en famille.
Męme si ça ne mčne qu'ŕ un dîner,
vous iriez dans la bonne direction.
Mais qu'est-ce que
ça vous apporte ŕ vous ?
En ce moment, toutes
les rédactions du pays
vous observent de trčs prčs.
Il cherchent une faille.
Et le fait que je ne parle pas ŕ ma famille,
qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Que tout le monde ici est censé
faire la męme chose ?
La presse le présentera comme ça.
C'est comme ça qu'ils nous ont collé
l'étiquette "secte".
Vous voulez que je remue
cette vieille histoire
et que j'en fasse
un stratagčme publicitaire ?
Vous pouvez vous en occuper
maintenant, ou attendre
et voir tout ça étalé
dans les journaux.
Voilŕ le numéro de votre mčre.
Au cas oů vous l'auriez oublié.
Il arrive et il dit :
"comment tu crois que j'ai sonné la cloche ?"
On disait que c'était une belle cérémonie.
Ce vieux Milt
a laissé une bonne famille
derričre lui.
Il avait beaucoup d'amour ŕ donner.
On a pensé que tu avais été tué,
ou peut-ętre capturé.
Il y en a qui disaient
que tu avais déserté.
Mais aucun de nous
n'y a accordé de crédit.
Disparu dans un rayon de lumičre...
personne n'avait pensé ŕ ça, hein ?
Tu es en ville ce soir ?
Bien. Nous organisons une veillée privée
pour Milt au Chauncey's.
Tu sais qu'il aimait sa Bud, alors on va
en vider quelques unes en son honneur.
Tu devrais venir.
On parlera du bon vieux temps.
"Le bon vieux temps" c'était
il y a un peu plus d'un an pour moi.
Tu pourras nous rafraîchir
la mémoire, alors.
Il y a un tas de choses dont
on ne se souvient plus du tout.
Une occasion d'échanger des petites histoires avec vous,
vieux débris ? Je ne manquerais ça pour rien au monde.
La NTAC m'a déjŕ examiné
plusieurs fois cette année.
Je ne crois pas ętre
attendu pendant encore...
3 mois, je crois.
Vous n'avez jamais manqué
un rendez-vous. Nous apprécions.
Vous nous avez avoué que
vous aviez développé ce pouvoir.
Et c'en est un qui peut
faire du bruit, je dois dire.
Excusez-moi, mais je ne vois pas en quoi me
soumettre ŕ d'autres tests aiderait qui que ce soit.
Ces mutations que
vous pouvez provoquer...
Je ne crois pas que ce soit des mutations,
Monsieur, mais plutôt des réparations.
De toutes façons, nos médecins
doivent jeter un oeil sur vous.
S'ils peuvent comprendre la façon dont votre pouvoir
fonctionne, ça pourrait aider beaucoup de gens.
Trčs bien, dans ce cas.
Je laisserai vos docteurs m'examiner
ŕ la loupe pour en avoir le coeur net.
Mais je vous demande une chose...
que vous préserviez ma vie privée.
Je ne veux pas devenir
un personnage public.
Ca marche pour nous.
Quand un nouveau pouvoir arrive aux oreilles de la presse,
qu'il soit bon, mauvais ou autre... Ca attire beaucoup de gens.
C'est justement ce que je veux éviter.
J'ai déjŕ vu le genre de comportement
qu'une peur irrationnelle pouvait provoquer.
Vous avez quitté
le Rwanda en avril 1994.
C'était le début
du génocide des Tutsis.
Le début ?
Croyez moi, j'ai vu mon lot d'horreurs,
pendant ces 2 semaines.
Si je n'avais pas obtenu l'asile
en Amérique, je serais mort.
Vous étiez seulement en train de vous habituer
ŕ l'endroit quand vous avez été enlevé, non ?
Il y avait des nuits ŕ Kigali oů j'aurais
accueilli avec bonheur la chance
de disparaître
de la surface de la plančte.
Donc, si je comprends bien tout...
Tu as utilisé les prédictions
de Maia pour parier ?
Je ne l'ai pas utilisée pour parier.
Je l'ai utilisée pour gagner.
Tu veux dire que
tu l'as utilisée pour tricher.
Tu as exploité une fillette
de 9 ans qui t'adore.
Elle s'amusait bien.
On s'amusait toutes les deux.
Mais une seule d'entre vous reste une adulte.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire que tu sois lŕ ŕ te défendre.
Eh bien, sur cette partie, j'avais
quand męme une défense crédible.
Parce qu'on en est pas encore arrivées
ŕ la partie dont tu as honte ?
Ces paris ?
C'était du tout cuit.
Mais j'ai eu besoin
d'argent pour les faire.
Tu sais, la bague
de fiançailles de maman ?
Tu parles de celle
qu'elle m'a laissée ?
Celle que j'aurais dű
porter ŕ mon mariage.
J'ai l'ai gagée.
Je ne peux pas croire que j'ai laissé
Maia dans tes parages.
Je veux que tu t'en ailles.
Lucy ! Si je regarde les infos ce soir,
est-ce que ça va me rendre heureux ?
Les chaînes que j'ai appelées
semblaient toutes trčs intéressées.
Un 4400 qui guérit les défauts de naissance ?
Je l'aurais moi-męme couvert.
Je suppose que le tuyau
est resté anonyme ?
Vous pouvez ętre sűr que
je ne voulais pas laisser mon nom.
Le Centre qui lâche un 4400 en pâture aux
médias ? Ca parait méchant, de toute façon.
Eh bien, ce n'est pas trčs habituel comme méthode, je vous
l'accorde, mais on l'a lâché donc on contrôle l'histoire.
et c'est mieux que de le laisser
pourrir dans le sous-sol du NTAC.
Shawn est monté se coucher ?
Il est sorti. Il a dit que c'était
pour raisons personnelles.
Bonne nuit, Lucy.
Qui est-ce ?
Qui est lŕ ?
Maman, est-ce que tu vas ouvrir la porte,
ou vais-je devoir utiliser ma clé ?
Shawn !
Bonsoir  !
Oh...
J'aurais dű... j'aurais dű
appeler avant, mais...
Surprise !
<i>Est-ce les 4400 vont se révéler ętre
le remčde pour toutes les maladies humaines ?</i>
<i>C'est la question qui est sur toutes les lčvres,
puisqu'il semble qu'un membre des 4400</i>
<i>a démontré son pouvoir de réparer certains
défauts génétiques infantiles in utero.</i>
<i>Des sources anonymes prétendent que Edwin
Mayuya, un infirmier de 38 ans de l'hôpital de Mercy</i>
Assassin !
<i>... est responsable d'une série
de guérisons miraculeuses...</i>
Assassin !
<i>... ces 5 derniers mois.</i>
Assassin ! Assassin !
<i>... mais si ces affirmations
se révčlent ętre vraies...</i>
C'est lui, l'homme
qui a tué tes parents !
Il y a mieux.
Je bondis dans le sičge du tireur
et Tyler est pied au plancher
sur l'accélérateur.
On avait parié 200 billets
sur cette course.
et Davis est 10 mčtres derričre moi.
Je peux presque l'entendre hurler...
"Pas par lŕ. Il y a des mines."
Si j'avais su qu'il était sérieux,
j'aurais peut-ętre fait attention.
Ouais, ouais.
Personne n'allait
nous suivre sur ce chemin
alors on est arrivés 2 minutes avant
le peloton, et on a partagé l'argent.
On a acheté quelque chose comme 5 fűts
de Budweiser pour le club des officiers.
Regardez-moi ça.
C'est la męme que dans le temps.
Comme toi, Tyler.
C'est difficile ŕ croire.
50 ans ont passé.
On est la męme bande,
avec la męme bičre.
C'est super de vous revoir, les gars.
C'est dommage d'avoir attendu
la mort de Milt pour que ça arrive.
C'est dur de trouver des raisons
pour réunir toute la bande.
Ce n'est pas toute la bande, non ?
Il y a toujours Lee.
Lequel d'entre vous
va me dire oů il est ?
Qu'est-ce que ça peut faire ?
Ca a de l'importance pour moi.
La derničre fois que j'en ai entendu parler, il était
dans un hôpital pour vétérans ŕ la sortie de Bakersfield.
Ca fait longtemps
qu'il n'est plus en forme.
Ecoute. Tout le monde ici se sent mal
ŕ cause de ce qu'il t'a fait.
Ce n'est pas assez ?
Ca ne va pas te quitter juste parce que
tu auras parlé ŕ Lee. Je veux dire...
Fais-toi une faveur :
oublie tout ça.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu sais, ton guérisseur miraculeux ?
En fait son vrai nom est Edwin Musinga.
Tous ses papiers ont été falsifiés.
Il  est recherché par le gouvernement
Rwandais depuis 1995.
Recherché pour quoi ?
Des atrocités.
Il était médecin pendant la rébellion.
Il a tué un tas de gens.
J'étais pédiatre
dans une clinique de Kigali.
Je suis Hutu.
Mais la plupart de mes patients
étaient des Tutsis.
Ainsi que beaucoup de mes amis.
Ca a remis ma loyauté en question
quand les tueries ont commencé.
Des militaires sont venus
dans ma clinique
et m'ont dit qu'ils voulaient
en faire un endroit sűr,
un endroit oů les Tutsis
pourraient venir,
pour ętre ŕ l'abri des massacres.
Et ils sont venus.
A 15h, la clinique était pleine.
Toutes les chambres, tous les couloirs.
Tous remplis de Tutsis effrayés
qui me voyaient
comme leur protecteur.
Les męme soldats sont revenus
avec la milice ŕ leurs côtés.
C'était un pičge.
Vous avez au moins
essayé de les arręter ?
La radio annonçait que
les Tutsis avaient tué
notre président.
La colčre s'est répandue
comme un virus.
J'ai été infecté aussi.
Alors vous ętes simplement resté lŕ
et vous n'avez rien fait ?
Partout dans la ville,
il y avait des meurtres organisés.
On aurait jamais réussi
ŕ rendre la ville sűre.
Vous auriez pu essayer.
Doucement, Tom.
Laisse-le finir son histoire.
Oui, j'aurais pu essayer.
C'est vrai, je le sais maintenant.
Ils m'ont fait regarder.
Ils les ont tous tués.
Je les ai autorisés ŕ transformer
ma clinique en lieu de massacre.
Mais vous n'avez tué
personne vous-męme.
C'est vrai. Mais il n'y a pas
beaucoup de différence.
Je savais ce qui allait se produire.
J'ai laissé la situation se mettre en place.
Je suis coupable.
Ma femme m'a quitté.
Je ne l'ai vue, ni elle,
ni mes enfants depuis.
Ils viendront peut-ętre
ŕ mon exécution.
Votre gouvernement fait pression
pour votre extradition.
Vous devriez ętre
dans un avion ŕ l'heure qu'il est.
Mais votre pouvoir...
complique les choses.
Ca me laisserait une chance
de faire amende honorable.
Mais je pourrais sauver un enfant
chaque jour pendant le restant de ma vie,
que je mériterais encore
chacun de mes cauchemars.
Qu'est-ce qui t'as pris
lŕ dedans, Tom ?
Parce que si ton intention était de
le faire taire avant qu'il ait fini son histoire,
ce  foudroiement du regard
était un bon moyen d'y arriver.
Ce mec devrait ętre sur le chemin du tribunal.
Au lieu de ça, on lui sert un déjeuner en bas.
Alors quoi ? Tu préfčrerais
qu'on le laisse mourir de faim ?
Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire
que tu le défendes !
Je ne défendrais jamais ce qu'il a fait. Mais
je peux débattre sur ce qu'il peut faire maintenant.
Il y a une raison pour que le futur l'ait
renvoyé avec ce pouvoir incroyable.
Mais pardonne moi si ça
ressemble trop, disons, ŕ toi ?
Non, non. Pas cette fois.
Non. On est pas en train de parler d'un criminel.
On est męme pas en train de parler d'un meurtrier.
On parle de génocide, Diana.
Peut-ętre que l'avenir n'a aucun
problčme avec ça, mais moi si.
Donc si je ne pense pas que le monde se portera
mieux quand ce mec aura une balle dans le crâne,
je défends un génocide ?
Non. Il y a des gens au Rwanda
ŕ cet instant, qui ont perdu des mčres,
des frčres et des enfants
dans cette clinique.
Et il est resté lŕ,
et a laissé ça arriver.
Tout comme notre gouvernement.
Comme tous les gouvernements du monde.
Ils savaient tous ce qui se passait, Tom,
mais personne n'a levé
le petit doigt pour arręter ça.
Oui. Et c'était mal également.
Tout comme ça maintenant.
On travaille aveuglément
depuis 1 an et demi,
supposant que ces gens savaient
ce qu'ils faisaient. Mais trop, c'est trop.
Ok, on sauve le futur, mais on relčgue
la justice au second plan.
C'est quelque chose dont tu veux
faire partie, Diana ?
Alors comme ça, Shawn
s'est pointé de nulle part,
et tout ŕ coup, je suis censé laisser tomber
tous mes plans et aller ŕ un dîner de réconciliation.
On sait tous les deux pourquoi
il se montre, non ? Pas besoin d'ętre
psy pour comprendre ça,
Son papa mentor se fait tuer,
et il vient ramper devant mamant,
Danny, tu veux pas arręter de te plaindre ŕ propos de
Shawn ? C'est ton frčre, ça fait un an, laisse tomber,
Hey, c'est toi qui lui a parlé et qui m'a dit
ŕ quel point on lui avait lavé le cerveau,
Et alors, il vient diner, c'est bien, non ?
Fais semblant, au moins, pour ta mčre.
Ca veut dire quoi ça, mec ?
Je ne veux plus
t'entendre râler, ok ?
Je ne comprends pas,
pourquoi tu dois partir ?
Tu ne peux pas simplement
dire que tu es désolée ?
Ca ne marche pas toujours
comme ça avec les adultes,
Parfois quand on a trop
gâché ce qu'on a,
ętre désolée n'y change rien.
Ca arrive souvent quand je
suis impliquée, ŕ vrai dire.
Mais si tu ne fais que partir,
ça n'arrange rien.
Chérie...
Je suis désolée,
je t'ai utilisée,
c'était mal.
Mais je te pardonne.
Je dois quand męme partir.
Je sais que j'ai passé toute la journée ŕ cuisiner
ces lasagnes, mais sont-elles assez bonnes
pour que vous en restiez
tous deux bouche-bée ?
Je n'ai pas mangé
de truc aussi bon
depuis un an.
C'est bien, tu as dit quelquechose.
Danny, pourquoi
tu n'essaierais pas ?
Trčs bien, tu sais quoi ?
C'est bon, Danny,
cette soirée est pour toi et moi,
c'est pour ça que maman l'a organisée.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je fasse, dire que tout est beau
dans le meilleur des mondes ? Ce n'est pas aussi facile.
Je ne m'attends pas ŕ ce que ça le soit, mais il y a
des choses qu'on doit mettre au clair, toi et moi.
Ok, donc tu vas me présenter
tes excuses maintenant, c'est ça ?
Ou c'était juste mon imagination
quand tu t'es tapé ma petite amie ?
Ce truc avec Nikki,
j'aurais aimé que
ça se passe autrement.
Et quand tu as failli
arręter mon coeur,
ou peu importe ce que tu as fait ?
Tu te sens mal pour ça aussi ?
Tu sais quoi ? Tu veux me haďr
pour toujours ? Ne te gęne pas,
mais tu es mon frčre, et je suis venu
ici pour arranger les choses avec toi.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je
fasse ? Tu veux me frapper ou quoi ?
Je veux dire, ne te gęne pas.
Danny, si tu oses...
Juste un coup, 'man, il le mérite.
Regarde, il le demande.
C'est bon ? On a fini ?
On le laisse partir ?
Il est responsable de la
mort de centaines de gens.
Ce n'est pas ŕ nous de déterminer
son degré de culpabilité.
Ok, écoutez, je ne peux pas le renvoyer
au Rwanda. Pas tout de suite en tout cas.
Pendant ce temps, ses 48 heures
de préventive sont passées
et le centre des 4400 a engagé des avocats
qui nous mettent la pression pour le libérer.
La presse couvre toute cette histoire, est-ce
qu'il sera au moins en sécurité dans la rue ?
Ouais, la sécurité d'un criminel de guerre,
c'est ma plus grande inquiétude.
Ca ferait bien de l'ętre.
En échange de notre protection, Edwin Musinga
a accepté de continuer de venir dans nos labos.
On le babysitte ?
En échange de pouvoir étudier
ce qu'il est capable de faire.
Ce gars pourrait faire avancer la recherche
génétique de plusieurs centaines d'années.
Ca me semble ętre un bon marché.
Hmm-hmm.
Depuis combien de temps
avez vous des malaises ?
De temps en temps, depuis un mois.
Vous auriez dű
en parler aux médecins.
Vous oubliez, Mlle Skouris, je suis médecin. Je suis
anémique depuis l'âge de 15 ans, je suis certain...
- Tu vas bien ?
- Oui.
Reste avec lui, je vais dehors.
A terre, ŕ terre, ŕ terre,
Faites partir ces gens,
je veux une voiture de patrouille
toutes les 20 minutes ici,
A l'aide !
Appellez une ambulance !
Je crois qu'elle a
une crise cardiaque.
C'est lui qui a fait ça.
Pourquoi le protégez-vous ?
C'est un assassin !
Qui a rendu ça publique ?
Je peux vous assurer
que ce n'est pas le NTAC.
Peut-ętre que si j'étais sorti
leur parler, on aurait pu éviter ça.
Oh oui, ça les aurait calmés,
ils vous auraient déchiré.
Je pense avoir démontré jusqu'oů
je suis pręt ŕ aller
pour rester en vie.
Vous pouvez ajouter une autre victime
ŕ votre liste, cette femme est morte.
Ok, Tom, pourquoi tu ne retournerais pas
dehors ? Va faire un tour dans le quartier.
Vous savez pourquoi
elle était lŕ dehors ? Hein ?
Parce que cet enfoiré a laissé son fils, sa belle-fille,
et environ 8 de ses neveux et ničces mourir
- Hein ? N'est-ce pas vrai, docteur ?
- Tom, arręte !
Arręte !
Je regrette sa mort,
de męme que
je regrette toutes ces morts.
Oui, eh bien je suis désolé que vous vous sentiez
mal mais ça n'y change rien, n'est-ce pas ?
Tom, assez !
Lâche le, maintenant !
Lâche le.
Ecoute, Benjamin, je ne vois pas
oů est le problčme,
Edwin Musinga n'a jamais tué personne,
pas personnellement en tout cas.
Je t'ai déjŕ donné les noms
des sénateurs ŕ appeler,
parle leur face-ŕ-face
si tu le peux.
Je dois me pointer lŕ-bas et le faire moi-męme ?
Je ne pensais pas avoir ŕ le faire.
Envoie moi un message sur mon PDA
quand les choses commenceront ŕ bouger
Vous avez mis tous
vos contacts sur le coup ?
J'aimerais ętre dehors
ŕ négocier quelques faveurs,
voir les pontes se mettre d'accord...
Vous voulez vraiment négocier
des faveurs pour ce gars ?
Il dit lui-męme qu'il est mauvais.
Oh, il est pire que mauvais,
c'est pratiquement un boucher.
Alors pourquoi est-ce qu'on
perd notre temps avec lui ?
Quelqu'un d'autre pourrait réellement
avoir besoin de notre aide, Matthew.
C'est un 4400,
Coupable ou non,
il fait partie de notre plan,
il y a une raison pour laquelle
ils lui ont donné ce pouvoir,
et je doute que ça ait quoi que ce soit
ŕ voir avec son éxécution au Rwanda.
Alors, disons que s'il était
revenu sans pouvoir,
est-ce qu'on ferait
tout ça pour lui ?
Vous ętes le boss.
A vous de me le dire.
Le petit déjeuner est pręt.
Tu sais que tu vas devoir commencer
ŕ me parler au bout d'un moment ?
Je doute sérieusement que
tu tiennes jusqu'ŕ tes 18 ans.
Elle t'a utilisée Maia.
Elle a dit qu'elle était désolée.
Eh bien, il doit quand męme
y avoir des conséquences.
Ton pouvoir est un don, mais
ça fait aussi de toi une cible,
et je dois te protéger des
gens qui veulent t'exploiter.
En outre,
tu n'es pas la seule que tante
April ait blessée cette semaine.
Mais c'est moi qui
lui ai montré la bague.
Elle n'en aurait męme pas eu connaissance
si je ne lui avais pas montré.
Bon, tu n'aurais jamais dű
jouer avec, c'est pourquoi
tu es privée de télé
cette semaine.
Ce que ta tante a fait
est complétement différent,
et elle le sait.
Elle a fait une grosse erreur,
c'est pas ce ŕ quoi
sert une famille ?
Pardonner quand quelqu'un
fait une grosse erreur ?
Peu importe
que je lui pardonne,
je ne peux pas l'avoir par ici.
Mais on n'a pas
une si grande famille que ça,
on ne peut pas virer quelqu'un
męme
si elle a déconné.
Oh, Maia, tu dois...
me faire une faveur,
cesse d'ętre plus
mature que ta maman.
Maintenant, viens.
Viens, sinon tes céréales
vont ressembler ŕ de la bouillie.
Allez.
Je ne plaisante pas.
C'était, genre, le plus gros
cocard que j'ai jamais mis,
il l'a pris comme un homme,
ça je lui accorde.
Ouais mec, aprčs ça,
on a mangé,
on a parlé un peu,
j'étais étonné...
ça s'est plutôt bien passé.
Ca fait plaisir ŕ entendre.
Je suis fier de l'avoir fait,
et bien, tu sais
ce que ça fait de toi ?
Hein ?
Ouais, je suis un génie.
Je ne capte pas, Kyle.
Tu vois, ça t'énerve quand je te dis
que je ne veux pas voir Shawn,
et quand je le fais, et que je
te dis que ça s'est bien passé,
tu hausses les épaules ?
Personne ne t'a demandé de
venir t'asseoir ici, mec.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Kyle ?
- Quoi, t'as des pertes de mémoire encore ?
- Laisse tomber.
Ecoute, si tu ne me dis pas ce qui
se passe, j'irai parler ŕ ton pčre.
Je n'ai plus de pertes de mémoire, ok ? Je
me sens bien, tu ne dis rien ŕ mon pčre.
Ah ouais ? Alors dis moi pourquoi
tu erres comme un zombie ?
Je me souviens maintenant,
de certaines choses que j'ai fait durant
mes pertes de mémoires, je me souviens.
Comme quoi ?
Je suis dans la merde, c'est tout ce que je
peux te dire. Je suis dans une grosse merde.
Il y a quelque chose
que je peux faire ?
Rends toi service.
Reste loin de moi.
T'as une cigarette ?
Tu as un emphysčme.
Je sais que j'ai un emphysčme.
Ce que je n'ai pas, c'est une cigarette.
Est-ce que tu sais qui je suis ?
Pendant une seconde, j'ai cru
que tu étais l'ange de la mort.
Richard Tyler.
Comment était
l'enterrement de Weinberg ?
Simple,
plein de dignité,
un peu comme Milt.
Je n'ai jamais aimé
sa façon de penser.
Tu sais, aprčs ta disparition,
il m'a accusé.
On s'est battu
une ou deux fois.
Bien sűr, il avait tort.
Alors pourquoi es-tu ici ? Pour me filer quelques
claques ? Débrancher ma pompe ŕ oxygčne ?
Euh...
Tu n'es pas une cible trčs
attrayante en ce moment, Lee.
Quoi alors ?
Tu veux des excuses ?
Au début,
quand je suis revenu,
je restais éveillé sur mon lit
de quarantaine ŕ penser ŕ toi,
toutes les choses que je te
ferais si jamais je te revoyais.
Oh,
tu veux ta vengeance.
Bon, désolé de te décevoir,
ça ne va pas marcher non plus.
Le temps m'a botté le cul beaucoup
mieux que tu aurais pu le faire.
Le temps botte le cul
de tout le monde, Lee.
Il t'aura aussi ŕ la longue.
Il a rattrapé
ce vieux Milt, pour sűr.
A l'enterrement,
ces gars se bousculaient pour dire
ŕ quel point ils étaient désolés,
mais toi tu as eu 50 années pour
réfléchir ŕ ce que tu as fait...
Je n'aimais pas avoir ŕ
frapper un collčgue officier,
mais tu m'as donné
une bonne raison.
J'ai mangé ŕ tes côtés,
je me suis battu ŕ tes côtés,
mais quand tu es sorti avec cette
femme blanche, tu as dépassé les limites.
C'est ce que tu disais avant.
Je le dis encore maintenant.
Le monde a changé, Lee,
tu n'as pas remarqué ?
Le monde...
peut-ętre, pas moi.
Et qu'est-ce que
ça t'a apporté ?
J'ai fait un tour
dans ta chambre,
pas de cartes,
pas de fleurs,
la dame ŕ l'accueil n'arrivait pas
ŕ croire que tu avais un visiteur.
Tu sais,
j'aurais vraiment aimé que
tu m'apportes des cigarettes.
Tu t'accroches toujours
ŕ tes habitudes, Lee...
męme quand
elles commencent ŕ te tuer.
Salut.
Ce ne sont pas que
des statistiques, Diana,
il l'a laissé se produire.
Je sais ce qu'il a fait, et je n'ai pas
besoin que tu me le répčtes.
C'est encore pire d'associer
des visages ŕ ces numéros.
On a un problčme.
Le département d'Etat a décidé
de s'opposer ŕ l'extradition.
Ils vont plaider
des circonstances atténuantes.
Donc Edwin s'en sort ?
Et qui sait combien de gamins
auront droit ŕ une vie normale ?
Non, pas autant
qu'on l'espčrait.
Nos labos n'arrivent męme pas ŕ comprendre comment
marche son pouvoir. Inutile d'envisager de le répliquer.
Et j'ai eu son évaluation médicale,
il se trouve qu'il est dans un sale état.
Il m'a dit qu'il était anémique,
et qu'il n'arrivait pas ŕ dormir.
Non, non, c'est pire
que ça. Ce pouvoir,
chaque fois qu'il répare un chromosome
fétal, il endommage l'un des siens.
Donc, s'il continue ŕ guérir
les autres... ça va le tuer.
Ecoute, si tu ne veux pas
parler de ce que tu as fait,
je ne vais pas t'y forcer.
Mais je te garantis,
peu importe ce que c'est,
il y a un moyen de t'en sortir.
C'est facile ŕ dire,
tu ne sais pas ce que c'est.
Dis le nous alors.
Comment peut-on t'aider si
on ne sais pas ce qui se passe ?
Je n'ai pas demandé d'aide. En fait, je t'avais
dit de n'en parler ŕ personne, Danny.
Et je ne suis pas n'importe qui.
Je suis ton ami.
Arręte de dire ça, ok ?
Je sais que vous voulez bien faire, mais vous
n'avez pas la moindre idée de ce dont vous parlez.
Je dois gérer ça moi-męme.
On comprend.
Par toi-męme, absolument.
Et on va t'aider ŕ le faire.
Je crois que
ce qu'il essaie de dire
c'est que tu as besoin de temps
pour t'éclaircir les idées,
et t'éloigner de tout afin que tu puisses
comprendre certaines choses.
Je peux faire ça pour toi.
Viens au Centre avec moi, Kyle.
Tu prends ça comme
une campagne de recrutement ?
Ce n'est pas de ça dont je parle.
Tu auras la place dont tu auras besoin.
Personne ne t'embętera.
Kyle, si jamais tu en arrives ŕ
avoir besoin de parler ŕ quelqu'un,
on a des conseillers,
des thérapeutes, des avocats.
Ca vaut le coup d'essayer mec,
parce que peu importe ce que
tu fais lŕ, ça ne marche pas.
Ma voiture est dehors.
Tu peux venir avec moi
maintenant, si tu veux.
Ok.
Laisse moi juste... J'ai deux ou
trois choses dont je dois m'occuper
filer une note d'absence ŕ l'école,
des trucs dans le genre.
Je te vois lŕ-bas ce soir.
Et je t'attendrai.
Ok.
Merci les gars.
Combien de temps
me reste-t-il ?
Eh bien, c'est difficile ŕ dire.
Je veux dire, vos gęnes mutent ŕ
chaque fois que vous soignez un foetus.
Il y a des signes qui montrent
qu'une maladie du coeur se développe.
Il y a des irrégularités
vertébrales sur votre IRM.
Si vous continuez ŕ guérir les autres,
peut-ętre un an, peut-ętre moins.
Et si j'arręte ?
Eh bien, si vous arrętez
de guérir les foetus,
alors le département d'Etat n'aura plus
de raison de s'opposer ŕ votre extradition.
Vous serez remis au
gouvernement Rwandais.
Qui me jugera et
me condamnera sans tarder,
donc,
peu importe ce que je choisis,
ça me mčnera ŕ la mort.
Oui, c'est exact.
Il semblerait que mes ravisseurs
ont un sens de l'humour pervers.
Bien sűr que je vais
continuer ŕ guérir,
tant que mon corps
me le permettra.
Au moins, comme ça, la vengeance
ne sera pas l'unique raison de ma mort.
Vous devrez ętre surveillés
par les médecins d'ici.
Ils essaieront de ralentir votre déclin
mais vous devriez vraiment venir avec nous,
parce que nous avons quelques uns des meilleurs
physiciens du monde parmi notre personnel.
Mlle Skouris, si vous ętes en train de m'offrir
un lit au NTAC, j'ai bien peur de devoir refuser.
Je n'ai pas évité une prison
pour mourir dans une autre.
Il y a un endroit
oů vous pourriez aller.
Les services médicaux du NTAC vont
avoir besoin de lui 5 jours par semaine,
je vous donnerai le planning.
Nous nous assurerons
qu'il soit ŕ l'heure,
ŕ chaque fois.
Edwin Musinga, voici Shawn
Farrell, il dirige le centre,
et vous avez beaucoup
de choses en commun.
Pas beaucoup de choses,
juste une seule.
Une chose trčs importante.
Tu lui as dit ?
Oui, il va continuer ŕ guérir,
ce qui ne me suprend pas.
Je l'ai emmené au centre des 4400.
Je pense qu'il est mieux lŕ-bas que chez lui.
Qu'est-ce que ça te fait, Tom ?
Des bébés seront sauvés,
et il aura la punition qu'il mérite.
Tu veux vraiment savoir ?
Je te l'ai demandé, non ?
Ca ressemble ŕ la justice.
Oh..
Salut.
Comment m'as-tu trouvé ?
Parfois c'est bien d'avoir
une gamine qui sait des choses.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ŕ Berkeley ?
Une boutique de tatouage
qui apprécie mon travail.
Oh.
Des amis chez qui je peux
m'incruster quelques temps.
Ecoute,
Di'... Je l'ai dit ŕ Maia, mais...
Je suis tellement désolée.
Eh bien, ça fait
du bien de l'entendre,
mais ça ne change rien.
On ne peut vraiment pas te croire,
ni te faire confiance, et...
Bon, tu ne verras pas Maia jusqu'ŕ ce
que tu me prouves que tu peux changer.
J'aimerais savoir comment faire
pour que tout se passe bien.
Oui, moi aussi j'aimerais
que tu le saches.
Et je sais que ça va prendre
beaucoup de temps,
mais tu restes ma soeur,
et tu es la seule que j'ai,
et je, euh..
je ne te laisse pas tomber.
Je l'ai rachetée chez
le pręteur sur gages,
je sais que tu as toujours estimé
que maman aurait dű te la laisser,
et pour te dire la vérité, je pense qu'elle me
l'a laissée simplement parce qu'elle pensait que...
Eh bien, elle a cru que c'était le seul
moyen pour que j'en ai une ŕ moi.
Hmm,
c'est un nouveau
genre de thérapie.
Di', je ne le mérite pas.
Non c'est vrai, mais tu vas
quand męme la prendre.
Un jour,
Maia portera cette bague
pour son mariage,
et j'espčre,
eh bien..
j'espčre qu'avant ça, vous
vous serez déjŕ retrouvés.
Oui.
Kyle ?
Papa,
j'ai dű partir.
Je suis désolé.
Kyle ? Hey, c'est moi.
Euh, oů es-tu mec ?
Il est 2h du matin,
tu n'es pas encore lŕ.
Ecoute... rappelle moi
quand tu auras ce message.
Ou viens ici. Ok ?
Viens.
Bon,
Ouais, je sais que vous voulez bien faire, mais vous
n'avez pas la moindre idée de ce dont vous parlez.
Je dois gérer ça moi-męme.

Pendant ces 60 dernières années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées
Elles ont été renvoyées
toutes ensemble
Sans aucun souvenir
de l'endroit où elles étaient
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un seul jour
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des pouvoirs
Toutes tentent de se reconnecter...
... avec leur vie passée
Nous ne sommes pas la menace,
nous sommes le remède.
Le monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans les 4400.
J'ai des pertes de mémoire.
Si tu as des pertes de mémoire,
tu devrais en parler à ton père.
Qu'est-ce qu'il va y faire ?
Me renvoyer au centre médical du NTAC ?
Donc, voyons si j'ai bien compris,
Vous vous êtes rencontrés, vous êtes tombés amoureux, et vous
avez passé 8 ans ensemble dans une sorte de réalité alternative ?
Liv, tu étais vraiment défoncée
la nuit dernière.
Quand je ferai une overdose,
ça ne sera pas une grosse perte.
Peut-être que je peux te sauver.
Peu importe ce que c'est,
il y a un moyen de t'en sortir.
C'est facile à dire,
tu ne sais pas ce que c'est.
Tu m'as dit tout ce qui s'est passé
cette nuit-là, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Si tu as besoin de temps
pour t'éclaircir les idées,
et t'éloigner de tout afin que tu puisses
comprendre certaines choses.
Je peux faire ça pour toi.
Papa,
J'ai dû partir.
Je suis désolé.
Ecoutez, je ne veux pas
entendre vos excuses.
Je me fous de la manière
et de qui vous devez utiliser,
Vous le faites sortir de garde à vue
et vous l'envoyez à l'aéroport de L. A.
Je le veux sur le prochain vol.
Skouris, où est Baldwin ?
Il n'est pas encore là. Pourquoi ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
La police de L. A. retient une espèce de voyou
de quartier qui veut revoir la lumière du jour.
Il prétend qu'il peut nous dire qui
a vendu l'arme du meurtre de Collier.
Qui se charge
de l'interrogatoire à L. A. ?
Personne. Je l'ai fait envoyer
ici pour l'interroger.
Je le sens bien.
Ca va plaire à mon équipier
d'entendre ça.
Tu me brieferas
quand j'arriverai au bureau.
Ecoute, on n'en est pas encore
à sabrer le champagne, mais
ce témoin a des infos qu'on n'a pas divulguées aux medias,
des détails spécifiques sur l'arme qui a tué Collier.
On dirait qu'on a enfin
trouvé une brêche.
Ecoute, Diana,
je dois vraiment y aller.
Tu vas bien ?
Tu as l'air un peu distrait.
C'est personnel.
Ne t'inquiètes pas.
Tu as une idée
de quand tu seras là ?
Je ne sais pas encore.
Je te recontacterai
dès que j'en saurai plus, ok ?
Ok, pas de problème.
Bye.
Depuis quand ça se produit ?
Calme toi.
Non, je t'ai posé une question.
Depuis quand ?
Ecoute, Kyle me l'a dit
il y a, genre, un mois.
Ecoute, tu te souviens
de cette nuit ?
Quell...
Quelle nuit ?
La nuit où il a failli se faire arrêter pour
avoir explosé la fenêtre d'une boutique.
Tu veux dire
quand il était bourré ?
Il n'a jamais dit qu'il était bourré.
Tu as dit qu'il était bourré.
Kyle a dit qu'il a eu
une perte de conscience.
C'est arrivé plein de fois depuis.
A un moment,
il se trouve à un endroit. Le prochain moment
dont il peut se rappeller, il se retrouve autre part.
Il ne m'en a jamais parlé.
Il n'a jamais rien dit.
Bon, il a essayé une fois,
mais tu ne l'as pas écouté.
Ecoute, tu aurais pu
venir me voir, Danny,
pour me dire ce qui se passe.
C'est ton cousin, et ton ami.
C'est pourquoi je lui ai promis
de ne rien dire.
Être renvoyé en quarantaine était
la dernière chose qu'il voulait.
Danny, Kyle n'est pas
rentré hier soir.
Si tu sais où il est,
s'il te plait, dis le moi.
Il est parti se poser avec Shawn
au Centre des 4400.
Génial.
Oncle Tommy...
Il y a autre chose
que tu devrais savoir.
Kyle pense qu'il a fait quelque chose
durant l'une de ces pertes de conscience.
Il ne nous a pas dit ce que c'était,
mais il avait vraiment l'air de flipper.
Voici la dernière
recommandation du comité
Un plombier de 37 ans de Détroit.
On lui a diagnostiqué un lymphome
de Hodgekin il y a 4 mois de ça.
Quand est-ce
qu'on nous l'amène ?
Dans 2 jours.
Shawn.
Où est-il ?
Qui ? Kyle ?
Il n'est pas ici.
Ne joue pas à ce petit jeu
avec moi, Shawn.
Vous voulez bien
nous excuser, Lucy ?
Merci.
Danny a dit que
Kyle est venu ici.
Ouais, eh bien, Danny devrait vérifier ces
textos, parce que Kyle n'est jamais arrivé.
Tu ne m'écoutes pas Shawn.
Je veux mon fils.
Tu ne m'entends pas.
Il n'est pas ici. Où est-ce que tu crois
que je l'ai caché, au sous-sol ?
Je ne laisserais pas
passer ça.
Oh mon dieu !
Oncle Tommy !
Juste parce que Kyle est en galère
ça ne veut pas dire que c'est de ma faute !
C'est déjà arrivé, Shawn.
Il n'est pas ici !
Il  n'est pas ici.
Kyle ?
T homas.
J'ai acheté ça dans un village
à la sortie de Barcelone.
Et  ils m'ont dit que
c'était très spécial.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Kyle ne m'a jamais parlé de ça.
Au moins je ne suis pas le seul
à ne pas être dans la confidence.
Je pensais que les médecins avaient dit
qu'il allait bien quand il a quitté la quarantaine.
Ils l'ont dit...
Mais il a passé 3 ans avec une conscience
séparée vivant à l'intérieur de lui.
Je ne pense pas que les médecins
savaient quoi faire de ça.
Est-ce que tu as
appelé la police ?
Je ne veux pas qu'ils soient impliqués,
pas avant que je sais ce qu'a fait Kyle.
Et Linda ?
Eh bien, elle a dit qu'elle n'a pas eu de nouvelles
de lui. Elle m'a promis d'appeler si ça arrive.
Je suis désolé pour tout ça.
Je suis juste contente
d'être de retour.
Où est-ce que tu vas ?
Eh bien, ce n'est pas en restant
assis ici que je vais le trouver.
Je viens avec toi.
Non. Ecoute... Je préfere que
tu restes ici, près du téléphone.
Comme ça, si il appelle...
Tu seras là.
Ok.
Je te contacte.
et ce gars est un consultant
médiatique de premier plan ?
Oh, bien plus que ça.
Keith Petrick a formé des premiers
ministres, des membres du parlement.
Je dirais qu'une interview avec Sky News
vaut bien quelques heures d'entrainement.
Il va me dire quoi ? Différentes manières
de dire qu'on n'est pas une secte ?
Non,
il va vous apprendre
à ne pas dériver du sujet.
La presse britannique
adore jouer à "je t'ai eu".
Keith.
Matthew Ross.
Merci d'être venu.
Voici Shawn Farrell.
Bonjour, ravi de vous rencontrer.
Shawn.
Juste une minute.
Désolé.
Oncle Tommy est venu me voir.
Ouais, c'est ce que je me suis dit.
Il est venu ici aussi.
Qu'est-ce que tu lui as dit ?
Eh bien, la vérité. Kyle nous a planté.
Il n'est jamais venu.
Ecoute,
tu sais, il peut encore se pointer.
- Tu sais ?
- Ouais.
Je te ferais bien visiter, mais...
Ouais. Non. Tu es débordé.
Je comprends.
Attends, attends, attends.
Liv. Liv. Hey.
Voici Danny, mon frère.
- Bonjour.
- Salut.
Voici Liv.
Elle est premier niveau.
En fait, je suis deuxième
niveau maintenant.
Vraiment ?
Je suis impressionné.
Brillant élève.
Hey, est-ce que tu aurais le
temps de lui faire visiter ?
Tu sais, Shawn,
faut pas te sentir obligé...
Je veux que tu vois cet endroit.
Attends un peu. C'est cool ?
Bien sûr. Oui.
C'est cool.
Amusez vous bien les enfants.
Je dois... Je dois retourner
travailler, donc...
C'est mon frère,
occupé à guérir le monde.
Quelqu'un doit le faire.
Tu es prêt ?
Oui. Je suis tout à toi.
Je sais qui a vendu
la carabine qui a tué Collier.
C'est un début.
Est-ce que vous avez un nom ?
Victor Rios.
R- I-O-S.
Il vit au 43207
Sumac Drive.
S- U-M-A-C..
C'est bon. Merci.
J'étais chez Victor le mois dernier.
Il est devenu tout excité
et a brandi ce flingue,
comme si c'était le retour
de Tony Montana.
Il voulait l'échanger
contre l'un de mes produits.
Je lui ai dit que
je n'étais pas intéressé.
Pouvez vous décrire
l'arme, Mr Kovec ?
Je l'ai vu monter ce truc.
Calibre .50. Jamais vu
des balles aussi grosses.
Et il avait cette lunette
énorme au-dessus,
Comme un néon affichant
"Tu ne peux pas rater ta cible".
Pourquoi êtes-vous tellement certain
que c'est l'arme qui a tué Collier ?
Parce que...
Quand j'ai vu Rios la fois d'après, il se vantait
du prix qu'il avait eu pour cette pièce.
C'était, genre...
deux jours avant que
Collier ne se fasse abattre.
Je me suis dit que
ça n'était pas une coïncidence.
Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ?
Je lui demande de te faire une
visite rapide, et 2 heures plus tard...
C'est un bon guide.
Elle vend vraiment bien l'endroit.
Danny s'attendait à voir
des têtes rasées et des robes.
Ouais, je n'ai même pas vu
un seul tambour.
Tu es déçu ?
Ah, tu ne sais pas ce que c'est
quand je me plains.
Donc, hey, écoute,
grand chef,
tu laisses tes ouvriers
sortir de la ferme le soir ?
J'ai invité Liv à une fête, mais elle est
trop timide pour te demander si ça le fait.
Pense à elle comme
à une missionaire...
Beaucoup de recrues potentielles
là-bas sur le campus de NorthMount.
Ca peut être sympa. Je n'ai pas
quitté le centre depuis un moment
Je ne pense pas que
ce soit une bonne idée.
Je suis désolé, mec. Il va falloir
que tu te trouves un autre rencard.
Tu es quoi, son maton ?
Danny.
Ecoute, vous pouvez trainer ici autant
que vous voulez, pas de problème.
Mais une beuverie,
ça c'est une autre histoire.
Le sage et puissant Shawn a parlé.
J'écoute et j'obéis, votre majesté.
Je suis sérieux.
Depuis quand Shawn a un problème
avec les beuveries ?
Depuis qu'il a développé
le complexe du messie.
Alors, à quelle heure est la fête ?
Très bien.
Je me suis réveillée au milieu de la nuit,
et Kyle était ici, affalé dans la couloir.
Ne sachant pas
pourquoi il était là.
C'est cela.
Et je l'ai chassé.
Vous étiez...
Vous étiez effrayée.
Ca se comprend.
Pas aussi effrayée que lui.
Je lui ai dit qu'il avait besoin d'aide, qu'il devait
vous parler de ces pertes de conscience.
J'aurais aimé qu'il le fasse.
On aurait fait le nécessaire.
Eh bien, il voulait.
Qu'est-ce qu'il l'en a empêché ?
Ecouté, Mr. Baldwin, vos relations avec
votre fils ne sont pas mes affaires...
On est d'accord, mais si vous avez
quelque chose à dire, dites le.
Je suis sûre
que Kyle vous aime...
Mais je ne pense pas
qu'il ait confiance en vous.
Quoi ?
Il vous a dit ça ?
A peu près.
Des oeufs, du beurre, des noisettes,
de la poudre de cacao.
Qui a dit que c'était difficile
de faire des brownies ?
N'oublie pas de préchauffer
le four à 350 degrés.
Euh, oh...
Maintenant
ça se complique vraiment.
Relaxe.
Je plaisante.
Ouais ?
Maintenant ?
Non. Ca ne devrait pas poser problème.
Il faut que je trouve une nounou d'abord.
Si il y a un problème,
je vous rappelle.
Je suis désolé, chérie, je dois aller travailler.
Je vais appeler Mme Skalka, voir si...
Non, attends. N'y vas pas.
Eh bien, je suis obligée.
On fera des brownies une autre fois.
Cet  homme..
Il ne faut pas que tu l'attrapes.
Quel homme ?
Celui que vous poursuivez.
Quelqu'un va être blessé.
Qui ?
C'est un de mes collègues ?
Je ne sais pas.
N'y vas pas.
Tu t'inquiètes pour moi ?
N'y vas pas.
Tu penses que je devrais monter
dans ma voiture et me casser d'ici ?
Ou demander à être assignée
à une autre affaire.
Hmm, mettre un autre
agent en danger ?
Ce n'est pas une option.
En as-tu parlé à Tom ?
Non, pas encore. Il n'est plus
sur ce dossier depuis un moment.
C'est sûrement mieux pour sa santé
qu'il en reste éloigné.
Elle a dit que quelqu'un allait être blessé,
mais elle n'a pas dit qui.
Je ne sais pas.
Les visions de Maia ne sont pas aussi
vagues habituellement.
Cette fois, elle a eu une vision
impliquant sa mère.
Peut-être qu'elle ne veut pas
la voir trop précisément.
Tu ne me fais pas
me sentir mieux.
Ok.
Et ça alors ?
Hmm ?
C'est mieux ?
Bien sûr.
Vous reconnaissez
cette homme, Mme Rios ?
C'était un client de votre mari.
Mari ?
Il m'a eu ma carte verte et
plus de problème que besoin est.
Pourquoi est-ce que vous ne demandez pas
à Victor ? Si vous pouvez le trouver.
Eh bien, c'est le problème, Mme Rios.
Votre mari a quitté le pays.
A l'heure actuelle, nous savons
qu'il est à Porto Rico.
Vous voyez ?
Vous en savez plus que moi.
Il en vous a pas dit qu'il partait ?
Je ne l'ai pas vu
depuis deux semaines.
Ecoutez, je dois retourner travailler.
Il y a un mois, votre mari a vendu
une arme à cet homme.
Votre mari est impliqué
dans un meurtre, Mme Rios.
Ce n'est pas très bon
pour vous.
Surtout si vous tenez
à votre carte verte.
Pourquoi ne jeteriez-vous pas un
autre coup d'oeil au portrait-robot ?
Je me rappelle du bonnet.
C'est pas un client régulier.
Il est juste venu une fois.
C'est  lui qui a acheté la carabine.
Et l'arme de poing.
Quelle arme de poing ?
Euh, vous savez... Comment
vous appelez ça ? Un 9 mm.
Rien d'autre ?
Il était jeune, une vingtaine
d'années. Très calme.
Il n'est resté que quelques minutes,
et est reparti en taxi.
Comment vous le savez ?
Je l'ai appelé pour lui.
Oh, on va avoir besoin
de ce numéro.
On était au milieu de travaux
pratiques dans le labo de biologie,
Kyle s'est levé,
a dit qu'il revenait, et voilà...
Bye bye.
On ne l'a pas revu
avant le lendemain.
A quelle heure est-il parti ?
Ca devait être à 7h ou 8h, max.
Il a tort, comme d'habitude,
c'était plus vers 6h.
Tu ne te souviens pas ? On a cassé
juste après que Kyle soit parti.
Ouais vous voyez.
Vous vous rappellez de la date ?
A la fin du mois dernier, non ?
C'était le 25.
Vous en êtes sûre ?
Oui, je me rappelle, quand je suis rentrée
au dortoir, c'était partout aux infos.
Le meurtre de Jordan Collier.
Baldwin.
Allez-vous nous gratifier
d'une visite demain ?
Oui, je l'espère, mais
maintenant j'en doute fort.
Le doute ne fait pas l'affaire.
On se rapproche de ce gars. Ecoutez, on a
des pistes réelles, et j'ai besoin de vous ici.
Quel genre de pistes ?
Vous voulez le savoir ?
Ramènez vos fesses au boulot.
Thomas, ça pourrait être
n'importe qui.
Regarde de plus près. Dis moi
qu'il n'y a aucune ressemblance.
C'est tordu. Pourquoi est-ce que
Kyle tuerait Jordan Collier ?
Si ça s'est produit durant l'une de ces pertes
de conscience, il n'a pas besoin d'une raison.
Pas si le futur voulait la mort
de son prophète numéro 1.
Donc tu penses
qu'ils le contrôlent encore ?
Oui, ils dirigent ses actes,
ils le déplacent comme une marionnette.
Tout est possible.
Bien, dans ce cas,
il n'est pas responsable.
Le coup du "voleur de corps" ? Alana,
je ne pense pas qu'un jury va y croire.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils veulent
faire de Kyle ?
Ils ont pris 4 années de sa vie,
ce n'est pas assez ?
Ils nous ont prévenu de ça,
tu te rappelles ?
Ils ont dit que
tu ferais face à une crise.
Ouais, et quoi,
ça rend tout ça correct ?
Ils m'ont prévenu ?
Je ne me souviens pas qu'ils m'aient dit
qu'ils feraient de mon fils un meurtrier.
Il doit y avoir une raison.
Ne  les défends pas, Alana.
Ne fais pas ça ! Ils m'ont utilisé...
Nous tous... Kyle, Shawn...
Je suis gavé.
Je l'aime aussi.
Je sais. Je sais que tu l'aimes,
Alana. C'est juste que...
Je dois le trouver avant le NTAC.
Je dois le trouver.
Arrête, c'est sérieux là.
Tes réponses vont déterminer jusqu'où
tu pourrais aller dans le Centre.
Si le vigile se pointe,
on se fait tous les deux virer.
C'est assez loin ?
Ok... Première question...
Est-ce que tu t'es amusé ce soir ?
N'es-tu pas content
de ne pas avoir écouté Shawn ?
Ca fait deux questions.
- Shhh.
- Oh !
Tu es censé penser aux réponses,
pas les dire tout haut.
- Bien.
- Les règles sont les règles.
Ok.
Quoi, on a fini ?
Deuxième question...
Es-tu prêt pour que
cette nuit se finisse ?
Si ta réponse à la deuxième
question est "non",
enlève tes lunettes
et prends tes pilules.
Percocet.
Où est-ce que tu as eu ça ?
A la fête. Ton pote les avait
dans son armoire à pharmacie.
Donc tu les a volés ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
Cette zone est fermée.
Merci beaucoup, Mme Skalka.
Je n'arrivais pas à dormir.
A cause de moi ?
Je suis à la maison,
maintenant, chérie.
Ne t'inquiètes pas.
Tu sais, cette affaire
sur laquelle je bosse,
peux tu me dire
ce que tu as vu d'autre ?
Rien d'autre ?
Parce que si tu me caches
quelque chose...
Je t'ai tout dit.
Tu ne me crois pas ?
Bien sûr que je te crois.
Tu vas travailler demain ?
Eh bien, chérie, c'est mon job.
Est-ce que je peux
dormir maintenant ?
Bien sûr.
Voilà.
Linda.
As-tu des nouvelles de Kyle ?
Non, je t'aurais appelé si c'était le cas.
J'espèrais que tu en aies.
Linda, vous parlez
tout le temps ensemble.
Ouais, je ne me rappelle pas d'une ligne
l'interdisant dans notre accord de divorce.
Ecoute, Linda, si tu as
la moindre idée d'où il peut être...
Quoi, tu crois que
je te cache quelque chose ?
C'est toi qui a tous ces secrets.
Ecoute, tu es sa mère. Ce serait logique
que tu essaies de le protéger.
Par tous les moyens possibles.
Mais je pensais que c'était la raison pour
laquelle il vivait avec toi, n'est-ce pas ?
Le protéger était censé
être ta spécialité.
Tu veux me blamer pour ça ? Bien, vas y.
Mais je dois trouver Kyle maintenant.
Et s'il ne veut pas
que tu le trouves ?
Je pense qu'il a des problèmes.
De sérieux problèmes.
Tom, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
Donne moi
au moins un indice.
Tu ne veux pas savoir.
Comme je l'ai dit...
C'est toi qui a tous ces secrets.
Allo ?
Kyle, je viens
de parler à ton père.
Tu ne lui as pas dit où j'étais.
Tu es venu vers moi parce que tu ne voulais pas
retourner au NTAC, c'est ce que tu m'as dit.
Maman, je ne peux pas
t'en parler, je te l'ai déjà dit.
Eh bien, tu ne m'as pas
tout dit, n'est-ce pas ?
Maman, s'il te plait.
Kyle, dis moi ce qui se passe.
Pouvez-vous nous
excuser un instant ?
- Bien sûr.
- Merci.
Ne me dis pas
"je te l'avais dit".
Ok, je ne le ferai pas,
mais c'est le cas.
Ne va pas accuser Danny pour ça,
c'est de ma faute, ok ?
La nuit est passée vite,
j'ai bu quelques bières, et..
Tu ne devrais pas boire de bière.
Tu ne devrais rien prendre du tout.
Il y a un mois,
tu étais dépendante.
Arrête tes sermons,
j'ai déjà fait mes valises.
Tu sais, si tu veux partir,
je ne peux pas t'en empêcher.
Mais si tu veux rester...
Et que tu peux me promettre que rien
de tout ça ne se reproduira, alors s'il te plait,
profites de la vie
d'un premier niveau.
Je suis deuxième niveau.
Plus maintenant.
Mr. Farrell ? Est-ce que ça va
prendre plus de temps ?
Non, venez.
Donc j'ai...
j'ai écrit un paquet
de nouvelles chansons.
Je pourrais peut-être te les jouer.
Oui. On verra.
Ce n'est pas comme si je le connaissais
mieux que toi, mais on discute.
Et il t'a dit où était
sa cachette secrète ?
Non, mais tu as regardé
dans les endroits évidents,
Kyle aime son intimité.
Peut-être que tu le connais
mieux que moi.
Non...
Je ne veux pas y croire...
Je continuais...
Je continuais à espèrer
que j'avais tort.
Thomas, ce n'est pas Kyle.
Tu dois t'accrocher à ça.
Ok.
Attends, ne te retourne pas.
Alana,
Prends ça, cache le chez nous.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Retourner bosser.
Très bien, je veux
qu'on sécurise cette zone.
Garrity, je veux un mandat pour ouvrir et fouiller
tous ces casiers aussi vite que possible.
Bien.
Regardez qui est sorti
de sa retraite.
Bon timing, Baldwin. Votre équipière
peut vous mettre dans le bain.
Enfin, si vous comptez
rester dans le coin.
- Je suis là.
- Hmm-Hmm.
Bon, on sait que deux jours
avant l'assassinat,
notre homme est venu dans cette station
avec un sac plein d'armes à feu.
Il a pu aller n'importe où
à partir d'ici.
Oui, c'est pourquoi on quadrille
toutes les lignes de métro,
On interroge les porteurs de bagages,
les agents de guichets, les conducteurs de bus...
Ca me parait bien.
Entre temps, on a eu
un cireur de chaussures qui a
identifié le portrait-robot. Il prétend que notre homme
a fait de la monnaie pour s'acheter un casier.
Il se souvient quel casier ?
Il pense que c'est
dans ce groupe là,
mais avec tous les gens qui utilisent
ces casiers chaque mois...
Les chances sont de 1 sur, quoi, 10000,
qu'on trouve quoi que ce soit d'utile.
Ouais, alors pourquoi
on s'embête avec ça ?
On ne sait jamais.
Une empreinte nous suffit.
Ouais, on peut juste espèrer.
Je suppose.
Tu vas bien ?
Maia a eu une autre vision.
Maintenant, elle dit que
si on attrape ce gars,
quelqu'un va être blessé.
Elle a dit qui ?
Bon retour.
Tom est ici ?
Euh, non il n'est pas là.
Vous devez être Alana.
Je suis Linda.
Je sais.
C'est mon interview ?
Je ne veux pas la voir.
Je sais que j'ai foiré.
Je n'irais pas
jusqu'à dire "foiré".
Mais vous pourriez
améliorer le contact visuel,
une meilleure énonciation.
Mais ils n'en ont retiré aucun
déchet inutile, et ça c'est déjà bien.
J'étais distrait. Liv était là juste avant,
et on s'est pris la tête avec ce truc...
Parce que vous avez dit à cette junkie
de ne pas sortir avec votre frère.
Ex-junkie.
J'essaie juste
de la protéger, c'est tout.
Je suis sûr que c'était pour ça.
Qu'est-ce que vous croyez,
que je suis jaloux de Danny ?
Vous vous rendez bien compte qu'une relation
avec cette fille est hors de propos.
Matthew,
donnez moi tous les conseils que
vous voulez concernant le Centre...
Mais ça se limite à ça.
Vous ne comprenez pas, Shawn.
Vous êtes le Centre.
Tout ce qui vous concerne,
tout ce que vous faites.
Vous ne pouvez pas vous permettre
d'avoir des relations inappropriées.
Jordan Collier n'avait que ça,
des relations inappropriées.
Je veux dire, toutes les filles ici
étaient des cibles potentielles pour lui.
Raison de plus pour ne pas
répéter ses erreurs.
Alors, quelle fille est assez bien
pour le grand Shawn Farrell ?
Je vous le ferai savoir quand
vous l'aurez rencontrée.
Passons à des sujets
plus importants...
J'aurais aimé avoir le temps
de nettoyer ce casier.
Les empreintes de Kyle
pourraient être partout dessus.
On doit le trouver,
lui faire quitter la ville.
Ou le pays.
Tu n'as rien pu tirer d'autre de Linda ?
Quelque chose qu'elle ne m'aurait pas dit ?
Non, elle est aussi
effrayée que nous.
Je me sens coupable
de lui mentir.
Moins il y aura de gens qui
connaitront la vérité, mieux ce sera.
Quand même, je sais à quel point elle doit être désespérée.
Son fils a disparu. Elle a besoin d'avoir des réponses.
Et tout ce sur quoi elle peut se reposer,
c'est une note d'adieu de 3 lignes.
Tu lui as parlé de la note ?
Non.
C'est elle qui en a parlé.
Je ne lui en ai jamais fait part.
Kyle...
Papa.
Non, Kyle, attends ! Attends !
Putain de merde,
- Arrête ça !
- Lâche moi !
Assez !
Assez, Kyle.
... Puis j'étais sur le toit, en train de
regarder Collier par la lunette, la façon
dont je sentais la détente,
quand j'ai appuyé dessus...
et comment son corps
s'est contorsionné avant de s'écraser par terre...
je veux dire, je me rappelle de tout ça,
mais c'est comme si c'était
les souvenirs de quelqu'un d'autre.
Ce le sont.
Tu ne contrôlais pas
tes actes, Kyle.
Tu n'as pas tué Jordan Collier.
Je n'ai pas eu d'autre perte de conscience
depuis. Tu penses que c'est fini ?
Espèrons le.
Combien tu penses
que je vais prendre pour ça ?
Kyle, je ne vais pas les laisser te mettre en prison
pour un crime que tu n'as pas commis.
- Tu m'as bien entendu ?
- Ouais.
J'aurais juste aimé que tu m'aies...
parlé de ces pertes de mémoire
quand elles ont commencé.
Ok, tu as essayé.
Je ne t'ai pas écouté.
Tu sais...
C'est pas nouveau, papa.
Je... Je sais que je n'ai pas toujours
été là pour toi Kyle, mais, je...
je pensais qu'on avait
des relations plutôt bonnes.
C'est le cas. C'est juste que,
tu sais, grandir avec un père qui travaille pour le FBI,
le NTAC... Ca peut être assez extrême, tu sais ?
Tu veux dire que
je suis assez extrême.
Tu peux être effrayant parfois.
Si tu ne me crois pas,
demande à maman.
C'est inutile. Je te crois.
Je suis désolé, papa.
Moi aussi.
Hey, bébé.
- Kyle.
- Bonjour.
Je t'ai emballé quelques affaires. Les autres choses
dont tu auras besoin, on les achètera à Bruxelles.
A quelle heure est le vol ?
Midi.
Très bien, on ferait mieux d'aller pointer
à l'aéroport. On sera plus en sécurité là-bas.
Ok, j'ai envoyé un e-mail à mon ami,
il nous retrouvera après l'atterrissage.
Ils m'ont promis de bien
prendre soin de Kyle.
Dis au revoir à maman
de ma part, ok ?
- Bien sûr.
- Ouais.
Je te promets que je lui annoncerai
la nouvelle en douceur.
- Je viendrai te rendre visite dès que je pourrai, Kyle.
- Ca sera cool.
Ok.
- Je t'aime.
- Je t'aime.
Très bien.
- Merci papa.
- Ouais.
Alana...
Surveille le bien, ok ?
Je le ferai Thomas.
Je le ferai.
Jusqu'à maintenant, on a trouvé
60 grammes de haschish, des DVD pirates,
et 3 trousses de toilettes qui appartiennent aux gens
qui se douchent dans les vestiaires du terminal.
J'espèrais qu'on trouve une photo de Collier avec
un gros X au milieu, couverte d'empreintes utilisables.
Ouais.
Tout va bien chez toi ?
Parce que si tu dois t'occuper de tes
problèmes personnels, c'est le bon moment.
Je peux rester avec les scientifiques au cas où
l'on trouve quelque chose d'intéressant
Merci. Je, euh...
Je vais rester par ici.
Skouris.
Quand est-ce que
ça s'est produit ?
Non. On arrive tout de suite.
C'était Jarvis. Elle a reçu
un appel de Metro West.
Ils ont arrêté un suspect il y a 40 minutes.
Ils disent que c'est notre homme.
Roy Keith Marsden.
25 ans, sans emploi,
a envoyé des menaces à Collier après que
son oncle ait rejoint le centre des 4400.
Oh, et regardez ça...
Il possède un JLHP-6
de calibre .50.
Alana ?
Laisse tomber l'avion.
Ramène Kyle à la maison.
Ils viennent d'arrêter un suspect
pour le meurtre de Collier.
Tu sais, si tu viens ici pour m'engueuler
à propos de Liv, oublie ça.
Ce qui s'est passé
c'est de ta faute, pas la mienne.
Tu sais,
tu aurais pu
me prendre en aparté,
et me dire qu'elle avait ce problème
de drogue. J'aurais fait machine arrière.
Donc...
si tu espères que je vais m'excuser et me mettre
à genoux devant toi, tu perds ton temps.
Je ne suis pas venu pour ça.
Ecoute, je ne veux pas que
ça devienne toute une histoire.
Ok, quand on était gosses,
on se battait comme des dingues.
Ouais. Tout le temps.
Ouais, et le lendemain, on avait oublié.
Et tout redevenait normal.
Ouais. Aussi simple que ça.
Il n'y a rien de mal
à la simplicité.
Est-ce que tu as, euh, prévu de rester ici,
ou tu vas me filer un coup de main ?
Pour la voiture ?
Je ne lave plus les voitures.
J'ai des gens qui le font pour moi.
- Ah ouais ?
- Ouais.
Ouais, eh bien pas moi,
alors attrape une éponge.
Oh, tu vois, maintenant...
J'aurais dû me douter
que j'allais finir trempé.
Ouais, grand garçon.
Salis toi un peu les mains.
Ca fait un bout, hein ?
Allez.
Hey, chérie.
Bonjour.
Ecoute, je sais
que tu as déja dinné,
mais qu'est-ce que tu dirais
de se remettre à faire ces cookies ?
Ok.
Génial.
Comment s'est passé ta journée ?
Plutôt bien.
Bien.
Et tu ne me demandes pas
pour la mienne ?
On a attrapé cette homme,
celui que l'on cherchait, et devine quoi.
Personne n'a été blessé.
Donc il n'y a pas de quoi s'inquiéter.
Tout est fini.
Pas encore.

Pendant ces 60 derničres années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées
Elles ont été renvoyées
toutes ensemble
Sans aucun souvenir
de l'endroit oů elles étaient
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un seul jour
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des pouvoirs
Toutes tentent de se reconnecter...
... avec leur vie passée
Nous ne sommes pas la menace,
nous sommes le remčde.
Le monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans les 4400...
Kevin est un génie, vous savez,
mais il ne s'en vante pas.
Kevin, est-ce que tu m'as parlé ?
Je n'ai pas
dit quoi que ce soit depuis trčs longtemps.
Genre 6 années.
Tu es en train de dire que Burkhoff est
le pčre de la technologie des 4400.
Je peux penser ŕ nouveau.
Kyle n'est pas rentré ŕ la maison hier soir.
Kyle a dit qu'il avait des pertes de mémoire
Tu aurais pu venir me voir, pour me dire ce
qui se passe. C'est ton cousin, et ton ami.
Kyle pense qu'il a fait quelque chose
durant l'une de ces pertes de conscience.
Il avait l'air de vraiment flipper.
C'est tordu. Pourquoi est-ce Kyle
voudrait tuer Jordan Collier ?
Si ça s'est produit durant l'une
de ces pertes de conscience,
il n'a pas besoin d'une raison.
Je ne me souviens pas qu'ils m'aient dit
qu'ils feraient de mon fils un meurtrier.
Je continuais ŕ espérer
que j'avais tort.
Ce n'est pas Kyle.
Tu dois t'accrocher ŕ ça.
Kyle...
tu ne contrôlais pas tes actes, Kyle.
Tu n'as pas tué Jordan Collier.
Laisse tomber l'avion.
Ramčne Kyle ŕ la maison.
Ils viennent d'arręter un suspect
pour le meurtre de Collier.
On a attrapé cet homme,
celui qu'on cherchait. Tout est fini.
Pas encore.
Jeudi 28 Juillet
17:37
Maman,
j'ai peur.
Je sais, ma puce.
J'ai peur aussi.
Mais tout va bien se passer,
parce que maman est lŕ.
D'accord ?
Quoi qu'il entre par cette porte...
je te protégerai.
Jeudi 28 Juillet - 07:22
10 heures plus tôt
C'est l'anniversaire de Collier aujourd'hui.
Il est mort sous la surveillance du NTAC.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Qu'est-ce qui veut dire quoi ?
Rien. Juste un détraqué...
ce n'est rien.
Je suppose que c'est
l'anniversaire de Jordan Collier.
L'état de Washington lui a donné un cadeau
d'anniversaire. Est-ce que tu as lu ça ?
Ils en parlent comme si c'était
un dossier facile ŕ boucler.
Il a menacé Collier. Deux témoins l'ont
identifié parmi une liste de suspects.
Mais ils ont tort.
Roy Mardsen n'a pas tué Jordan Collier.
Et toi non plus, Kyle.
Tu m'as dit qu'il n'irait jamais au tribunal
Ils veulent exécuter ce gars.
Ca ne va pas se produire, Kyle.
Personne n'a pu le voir sur ce toit. Tout...
n’importe quel avocat de la défense
fera une demande d'annulation
devant un juge avant la semaine prochaine.
Et si tu as tort ?
Et si ils le déclarent coupable ?
Qu'est-ce que je serais censé faire ? Rien ?
Mardsen a fait des allers-retours
en prison depuis qu'il a 15 ans.
Vol, agression, tentative de viol...
mais il n'a tué personne.
Et il ne va pas ętre condamné pour ça, Kyle.
Je ne vais pas laisser ça se produire.
Moi non plus.
Kyle, ça ne va pas ętre facile,
mais tu vas devoir commencer
ŕ mettre tout ça derričre toi.
C'est le premier jour oů
tu es de retour ŕ l'école,
et je veux que tu sois concentré
et acharné,
pour de bonnes notes.
Ok.
Ok.
Trčs bien.
Chérie.
Mme Benke va arriver d'une minute ŕ l'autre.
Il est temps de se lever.
Je ne me sens pas bien.
Tu as une sacrée fičvre, jeune fille.
Hey,
depuis combien de temps as tu ça ?
Malhonnęte ? Non, non, non. Je ne pense
pas du tout que nous soyons malhonnętes.
Les ętres humains utilisent moins de
20% de leurs capacités cérébrales.
Tout le reste est...
complčtement inutilisé.
Ici au centre des 4400,
nous essayons d'exploiter
ce potentiel inutilisé.
Donc, votre propre talent
vous croyez qu'il provient
d'un pouvoir cérébral accru ?
Donnez moi une autre explication.
Ecoutez, que vous croyez ou non que
nous avons été emmenés dans le futur,
quelqu'un nous a changé, et ils ont utilisé
la technologie pour le faire.
Nous essayons de découvrir comment
ils ont fait, afin de le partager.
Mais "premier niveau", "deuxičme niveau",
"révéler les pouvoirs qui sont en vous..."
vous devez admettre que cette terminologie
est plus religieuse que scientifique.
Et bien, le mouvement se base en partie
sur la foi et en partie sur la science.
C'est une association efficace.
Alors ŕ quelle heure est votre rendez-vous ?
Ils  m'ont dit 11:15...
mais ils me disent toujours 11:15.
Et  ils ne me prennent
jamais avant 12:00, 12:30.
Hey, c'est un suivi médical gratuit, non ?
Qu'est-ce que ça fait si ils sont lents ?
Suivi  médical gratuit obligatoire.
Si vous ne venez pas
pour le check-up trimestriel,
vous avez une meute de gorilles
frappant ŕ votre porte.
Ca ne vous plait pas ?
Ne venez pas.
Ca m'étonnerait qu'ils passent
les menottes ŕ une grand-mčre.
Est-ce que ça gratte ?
Ici.
39.5.
Pas étonnant que tu voulais rester au lit.
C'est un genre de grippe ?
Vraisemblablement.
C'est ok si on la garde ici
quelques heures ?
Je veux retourner ŕ la maison.
Je sais que tu le veux, chérie, mais le
Dr. Hudson va trčs bien prendre soin de toi,
et je viendrai te voir
aussi souvent que je pourrai.
J'aurais aimé emmener Citron.
C'est son chien en peluche.
Laissez moi deviner.
Il est jaune.
Oui.
Bon, je peux y retourner et le ramener.
Tu as une maman trčs gentille.
J'essaie.
A propos de cette éruption cutanée...
j'ai travaillé pour le CDC pendant 7 ans,
et je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel.
Ca a une forme assez bizarre, hein ?
Oui.
N'y voyez pas trop de choses.
Ca pourrait trčs bien ętre
de l'urticaire, une réaction allergique.
On s'en chargera.
Chérie, tu seras bien ici
si je vais chercher Citron ?
Ok, ma chérie.
Bye chérie.
Quand papa n'est pas lŕ, Isabelle lui manque
tellement. Mais voyager dans tout le pays,
parler ŕ toutes sortes de gens,
les renseigner sur ma vie...
c'est assez sympa.
Shawn est étonnant.
Cette femme vient ici.
Son scanner tomographique montre qu'elle a
une tumeur cérébrale de la taille d'une noix
20 minutes plus tard, elle est repartie.
Comme neuve.
Hmm.
Je vais la nourrir.
Elle n'a pas encore faim.
Comment tu le sais ?
Elle me l'a dit avant que tu n'arrives.
Donc elle...
me parle.
Elle communique.
Comme elle le fait avec toi.
- Depuis quand ?
- Ce matin.
Je pensais que tu serais heureuse. C'est la
premičre fois qu'elle me dit quelque chose.
C'est génial. C'est jusque que...
elle ne m'a rien dit depuis des semaines.
Je ne m'inquičterais pas ŕ ta place.
C'est juste comme tu me disais...
les gamins alternent souvent entre
leurs parents. C'est normal...
C'est juste qu'avec Isabelle,
ça se passe différemment.
Voici le major Charles Culp de la Division
des opérations de terrain de la NSA.
Washington nous pręte ses services.
Application immédiate, le major
et son équipe fourniront un soutien
dans tous les dossiers des 4400 qui
nécessitent une intervention armée.
Nous savons que ce bureau supporte une
charge importante de dossiers,
et nous sommes ici pour aider
quand ce sera nécessaire.
Bienvenue ŕ bord.
J'espčre que vous en ętes capable,
parce que je vais vous mettre
en raccourci sur mon portable.
On reste hors de votre chemin,
on vous laisse faire votre boulot.
Le moment venu,
nous espérons que vous
nous rendrez cette faveur.
Et bien, la derničre femme
ŕ qui nous avons eu ŕ faire
a libéré des spores de poison
de ses mains, donc euh...
si vous voulez la poursuivre ŕ ma place...
par tous les moyens.
Mes hommes et moi-męme sommes
habitués aux défis particuliers.
Ca fait combien de temps qu'on demande
une assistance tactique ?
8 mois.
Je suppose que quelqu'un lŕ-haut nous aime.
Les gars, vous avez lu vos mails ce matin ?
"Joyeux anniversaire Jordan Collier" ?
Tout le monde l'a eu dans le bâtiment.
Peut-ętre que Marco devrait mettre un
de ces gars pour le tracer ŕ la source.
Ils l'ont déjŕ fait. Ca vient d'un
terminal public d'un cybercafé.
C'était un nouveau compte mail.
Cool de savoir que Collier
a encore ses fans.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Des racines de valériane ou
quelque chose comme ça. Je ne sais pas.
Alana ne jure que par ça. Ca me calme un peu
Ma suggestion ? Double ta dose.
Tu as été un peu sur les nerfs derničrement.
Ma copine est d'accord avec toi.
J'ai besoin que tu me couvres
pendant une heure.
Maia a la grippe ou un truc dans le genre,
et Hudson veut qu'elle passe la journée ici.
Elle va bien ?
Je suis sűre que ce n'est rien.
Je veux dire, j'étais sűre
que c'était la peste bubonique,
mais le médecin m'a dit que ce n'était rien.
Donc tu as roulé sur un gars et
tu t'en es tiré sans rien ?
C'est une façon bizarre de le dire.
Ben, c'est un petit avantage d'avoir
un pčre au NTAC je suppose.
Et ce gars que tu as heurté,
il était bousillé ŕ quel point ?
Je ne peux pas vraiment en parler.
Tu sais, des histoires juridiques.
A qui je pourrais bien le dire ?
J'ai cassé ses 2 jambes et sa clavicule.
C'est tout ?
Il était dans sa voiture, Danny. Ce n'est
pas comme si j'avais fauché un piéton.
Ouais mais tu parlais de cette
"chose horrible" que tu as faite.
Je pensais que tu avais tué quelqu'un.
Quoi ?
Et bien merci beaucoup mec.
Pareil pour Shawn.
Et bien désolé de vous décevoir les gars.
Bon, écoute, fais moi une faveur, ok ?
Si tu as des problčmes une autre fois,
dis le ŕ quelqu'un.
Il n'y a rien que tu puisses nous dire ŕ moi
ou ŕ Shawn que nous ne pourrions pas gérer.
La prochaine fois que j'ai un accident
de voiture pendant une perte de mémoire,
tu seras le premier ŕ le savoir.
Ouais, tant que je ne suis pas
sur le sičge du passager.
Oh, hey, écoute, tu veux venir voir
"Arcade Fire" avec moi vendredi soir, ou
est-ce que tu dois rester chez toi ŕ
entretenir ta conscience coupable ?
Pas besoin. Je viens.
- Ouais ?
- Je viens.
- Bien.
- Ouais.
Je suis content que tu sois de retour.
Content d'ętre de retour.
Je dois y aller.
Ok. A plus.
Vous entendez ça ?
Ce bourdonnement ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Quoi ?
Est-ce que ça vient de votre gadget ?
Qu'est-ce qui vient de mon gadget ?
Ce bruit.
Je n'entends rien.
Moi non plus.
C'est quoi ce bruit ?
Vous entendez ça ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
J'ai comme un mal de crâne.
Est-ce que vous avez entendu ça ?
Un cadeau pour vous de ma part.
Amusez vous bien ŕ essayer
de survivre ŕ cette journée.
Pourquoi est-ce que ma signature
est sur cette commande ?
Parce que j'en avais besoin !
Ne signe pas d'autres papiers ŕ ma place.
Ils attendent sur ton bureau
depuis des semaines.
Si il y a une place pour ma signature,
ça doit ętre ma signature !
Foster et McClenahan sont en train
de s'entretuer prčs de l'ascenseur.
Juste avant que ça ne commence,
il y a eu un bruit.
Je  n'ai rien entendu.
Ouais et bien nous on l'a entendu !
il y a eu un genre de gémissement aigu,
et on a eu un autre de ces emails.
Il disait "Amusez vous bien ŕ
essayer de survivre ŕ cette journée."
Montrez-moi.
Ok, tout le monde, essayez de rester calme.
Si ce bruit ou ce signal vous a fait
quelque chose, vous devez le combattre.
De quoi est-ce qu'elle parle ?
Qu'est-ce que je viens de vous dire ?
- Nina.
- Vous avez vu.
Elle a sorti son arme en premier.
Je n'ai fait que me défendre...
Comment va-t-elle ?
Elle respire. Elle saigne beaucoup.
Emmenez la au service médical.
Park est en état d'arrestation.
Crowley, retiens le.
Baldwin, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Tant qu'on ne sait pas ce qui se passe,
personne ne rentre ni ne sort.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Procédure de sécurité activée.
Qui est une trčs gentille fille ?
C'est Isabelle.
Isabelle est intelligente.
Ravie de voir que vous vous amusez.
Lily. Je ne m'attendais pas
ŕ vous voir avant 17h.
Et bien j'ai déjeuné tôt. Je pensais
emmener Isabelle se promener dans le jardin.
Ca a l'air sympa,
n'est-ce pas petite fille ?
Oh, j'utilise tout le temps
ces cartes avec elle.
Voyons voir si je peux trouver une pomme.
C'est sa préférée.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Quelqu'un a mélangé les cartes.
Je leur ai dit un million de fois.
Vous les utilisez pour quoi faire ?
Celles-ci ne sont pas ŕ la garderie.
Je crois qu'ils les utilisent
pour les candidats,
pour leur profils psychologiques. Désolée.
Ok, Isabelle.
Tu vas venir avec maman.
Ok.
A trčs bientôt.
Et bien, le mouvement se base en partie
sur la foi et en partie sur la science.
C'est une association efficace.
Les 100.000 membres du mouvement
seraient certainement d'accord,
mais Kevin Burkhoff,
un chercheur en neurologie de
l'université de Western Washington,
pense autrement.
Euh, je ne mets pas en doute
la foi de qui que ce soit.
Pourquoi devrais-je ?
La foi est une bonne chose, n'est-ce pas ?
Mais  ce qu'ils font lŕ-bas n'a rien
ŕ voir avec la science. Je veux dire,
dîtes moi comment le jeűne,
la méditation, et le chant
peuvent altérer, de quelque maničre que ce
soit, votre neurologie. C'est irrationnel.
C'est une bonne arnaque,
mais ça reste irrationnel.
"Arnaque", le mot est fort.
Il convient bien.
Ils prennent ce noyau de vérité
ŕ propos du potentiel cérébral,
et l'utilisent pour tromper les gens
afin de leur prendre leurs économies.
Beaucoup de gens seront peut-ętre surpris
par votre position. Aprčs tout,
vous avez souffert de troubles paranoďaques
de la personnalité pendant des années.
N'est-ce pas un engin conçu
par un 4400 qui vous a guéri ?
Oui et j'en suis reconnaissant,
mais vous devez faire la distinction
entre les 4400 et le centre des 4400.
Les 4400 ont des pouvoirs remarquables...
Tout le monde le sait...
mais le centre co-opte ce phénomčne
pour le profit.
Ces machines auxquelles
ils connectent les gens lŕ bas ?
Elles ne devraient męme pas ętre branchées.
D'aprčs moi, il a toujours l'air dément.
Il m'a semblé plutôt sain d'esprit, Matthew,
surtout quand il nous a attaqué...
Shawn, ne réagissez pas trop vivement.
Ce n'est qu'une interview.
Oh...
Vous vous ętes bien débrouillé cependant.
Ouais.
Garrity, donne moi ce flingue.
Ecouté, c'est dingue, Baldwin.
Comment est-ce qu'on va se défendre ?
Celui qui nous fait ça veut
qu'on s'attaque entre nous.
Si on reste armés, on sera morts
avant la fin de la journée.
Et si on ne l'est pas, on sera massacrés.
Ecoutez, tous les gens de ce bâtiment sont
sous l'effet de ce truc, ok ?
L'équipe de la cafétéria pourrait ętre
en train de former une armée en ce moment.
Voilŕ pourquoi je vais découvrir qui est
en train de faire ça afin de l’arręter.
Ils font des check-ups
dans le labo médical aujourd'hui.
Ce qui signifie qu'il y a
des 4400 dans le bâtiment.
Tu penses que c'est l'un d'entre eux
qui est derričre tout ça ?
Je...
Je ne sais pas,
mais c'est tout ce que j'ai pour le moment.
Toi ?
Qui t'a donné le commandement ?
Il ne l'a pas. Je l'ai.
Le bâtiment est la cible d'une attaque
terroriste d'un 4400.
C'est désormais une situation militaire.
C'est génial, Baldwin.
Pourquoi est-ce que tu
n'expliques pas ŕ ces gars
pourquoi ils devraient laisser
tomber leurs armes, hein ?
Major Culp, le signal,
peu importe ce que c'est,
c'est comme si quelqu'un avait
posé une bombe enrageante.
Ca développe l'agressivité de tout le monde
dans ce bâtiment. Les hommes en tout cas.
On  ne peut pas se promener
avec des armes ŕ feu chargées.
Mon équipe est entraînée pour résister ŕ des
tactiques de pression psychologique.
C'est un pouvoir de 4400.
Vous ne pouvez pas y résister.
Il y a des 4400 en bas dans le labo médical.
C'est peut-ętre l'un d'entre eux
qui fait tout ça.
Baldwin s'apprętait ŕ aller lŕ-bas.
Cartwright, surveillez les.
Tous les autres, avec moi.
Attendez. Attendez.
Qu'est-ce que vous allez faire ?
Je vais trouver lequel d'entre eux
est responsable de tout ça.
Et alors quoi ?
Je vais m'assurer que ça s'arręte.
Faites attention.
Il y a une petite fille lŕ bas.
Si ce n'est pas elle,
alors elle n'a pas ŕ s'inquiéter.
Vous devez me laisser sortir !
On doit sortir !
On va se faire tuer !
Vous voulez bien arręter de dire ça ?
Ca ne nous aide pas.
Un "A" ?
C'est génial.
Mais qu'est-ce que mon nom fait lŕ-dessus ?
Et bien, on forme un binôme au labo,
n'est-ce pas ?
C'est notre présentation.
Mais je ne t'ai pas vu
depuis presque 3 semaines.
Je n'ai pas écrit un mot de tout ça.
Et bien ce n'est pas comme
si tu n'avais rien fait.
Tu as dit que tu voulais faire
une étude sur la mitose.
Tu as coloré les diapos.
Un ou deux, peut-ętre.
Ecoute, tu avais des problčmes, exact ?
Je me suis juste dit que,
peu importe ce que c'était,
tu pouvais probablement te passer
d'un "incomplet" en biologie.
Je ne sais toujours pas si je mérite ça,
mais, merci.
Qu'est-ce que je peux dire ?
J'ai un penchant pour les chats égarés.
J'ai l'air aussi pathétique ?
A peine.
Vous vous shootez ?
Ce ne me met pas vraiment en confiance.
C'est un sédatif. Si je ne me contrôle plus,
et que je deviens comme tous les autres ici,
je ne pourrai plus vous aider.
Qu'est-ce qui arrive ŕ mes agents ?
Je ne me sens pas différente,
mais eux ils deviennent tous dingues.
Dr Hudson ?
Je me sens encore plus mal.
Tu ne devrais pas ętre debout.
Qu'est-ce que tu as au bras, ma puce ?
Skouris, NTAC.
Vous devez me laisser entrer.
Le bâtiment est bouclé.
Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Atteinte ŕ la sécurité depuis l'intérieur.
C'est tout ce que l'on sait.
- Je dois y aller.
- Ca ne risque pas d'arriver.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Ma fille est lŕ dedans.
Jeudi 28 Juillet.
15h19
Je ne peux pas me le mettre moi-męme.
Tournez-vous.
Ne bougez pas.
J'arrive pas ŕ croire que
vous m'ayez cassé le nez.
Ouais, ben, vous avez cassé l'articulation
de mon doigt quand je vous ai frappé.
Mais j'ai toujours raison.
Le signal est constant,
Je me fiche que vous l'entendiez ou non.
C'est comme un sifflet ŕ ultrasons.
Ce n'est qu'une impulsion, ça va s'arręter.
On a juste ŕ attendre que ça disparaisse...
Fermez lŕ, tous les deux !
J'essaye de faire mon boulot.
Ce n'est pas vraiment le moment, Diana.
Marco,
qu'est-ce qui se passe ŕ l'intérieur ?
Ca dépend ŕ qui tu demandes.
Quelqu'un a lâché un mauvais sort ici.
Quelque chose qui augmente
notre instinct de défense et d'attaque.
Avec un gros penchant
pour la partie attaque.
Bon, Marco, je dois absolument entrer
et j'ai besoin de ton aide.
Chaque mâle de ce bâtiment
a 5 litres d'adrénaline
qui parcourent ses veines en ce moment męme.
Et la plupart d'entre eux sont armés.
Si tu es dehors, alors restes-y.
Ecoute, Marco. Maia est ŕ l'intérieur,
et je dois aller la retrouver.
Tu as accčs aux plans du bâtiment ?
Euh, oui.
Je peux les obtenir.
Fais-le.
Et qu'est-ce que j'aurai en retour ?
Eh bien... on pourra en parler plus tard.
Bien. Bien.
Je rappellerai ça ŕ ton souvenir.
Eloigne-toi de moi.
Tu es dans mon espace !
Reste en ligne.
- Tu es dans mon espace !
- Les mecs !
Réglez ça plus tard !
On doit faire rentrer Skouris
dans le bâtiment.
Je t'ai dit de te mettre ŕ genoux.
J'ai juste besoin de les prendre.
Elles me permettent de garder mon calme.
C'est un peu tard pour ça.
Tu es sűr que tu n'en veux pas une ?
Ca pourrait t'aider.
- Détache-nous. Vas-y.
- Détache-moi.
Prends des attaches.
Mets-les ŕ Rambo Junior.
Et seulement ensuite tu libčres les autres.
Hé, hé, oů est-ce que tu vas ?
Je vais aux labos médicaux.
En espérant que le major ait rencontré
de la résistance sur le chemin.
Quel genre de tests ?
Tu veux dire du genre test de Q. I. ?
Je ne sais pas, Richard.
Ces cartes étaient étranges,
et aprčs que l'on soit rentrées,
je l'ai changée.
Elle avait ces marques sur la peau.
Des marques ? Des bleus ?
Non. Comme des irritations.
Comme si quelqu'un l'avait maintenue
contre quelque chose.
Fais-moi voir.
Elles ont disparues.
Richard...
Ne me regarde pas comme ça.
Ce n'est pas le fruit de mon imagination.
Elle ne retournera pas dans cette garderie.
Lily... tu n'arrętais pas de dire combien
tu appréciais Ruth
et la garderie, et combien
Isabelle avait l'air d'aimer y ętre.
J'aurais aimé que tu sois lŕ.
Tu vois, Ruth avait ce drôle de sourire
sur le visage.
Réfléchis ŕ ce que tu dis. Personne ne fait
de tests sur elle ŕ la garderie.
Je sais ce que tu ressens du fait
qu'elle t'exclue, et
sans vouloir t'offenser, peut-ętre
que tu réagis trop vivement.
- Je peux la prendre une seconde ?
- Non.
Lily, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Excuse-moi. C'est cet endroit.
C'est comme s'il changeait tout.
Qu'il nous changeait, nous.
Ca va. Tout va bien.
Les cours de méditation,
les détecteurs synaptiques de potentiel,
et nos séminaires de purification...
c'est la moitié de notre cursus
que vous mettez sur le billot.
On n'en a pas besoin, Matthew.
Jordan semblait penser que si.
Jordan n'est plus lŕ, si ?
En plus, ce Burkhoff a raison...
un tas de psaumes ne permettra jamais
de développer le 4400 de qui que ce soit.
Qu'il le fasse ou pas, le produit se vend.
Attendez, attendez. Le "produit" ?
Ceci n'est pas un systčme pyramidal,
Matthew.
Les gens qui viennent ici cherchent
ŕ changer. Ils espčrent des réponses.
Et nous les trouverons,
mais si nous changeons,
nous paraîtrons faibles.
Pour l'instant, ce qui compte c'est que
les gens croient en ce que nous faisons.
J'ai besoin d'y croire moi aussi.
Personne ne bouge !
Ils sont partis. Ils se sont tous tirés.
Qui ętes-vous ?
Roger Wolcott.
J'étais juste venu pour mon check-up.
Les 4400 ?
Pour quelle autre raison serais-je lŕ ?
Maintenant, libérez-moi !
Jeudi 28 Juillet
16h22
Ca n'arrętera personne. Pas pour longtemps.
Espérons que personne ne nous trouvera.
Combien vous pensez qu'on a de chances ?
Plus on restera calmes, plus longtemps
nous resterons en vie.
Comment tu te sens ma puce ?
Je suis en sueur,
et je commence ŕ avoir du mal ŕ respirer.
Pauvre bébé.
J'ai quelque chose pour toi.
- Citron.
- Oui.
Aussitôt que tout ceci sera fini,
je t'emmčnerai ŕ l'hôpital, d'accord ?
Trčs bien.
Je suppose que vous ne m'avez pas
de peluche pour moi.
Ou alors une bouteille de Jack Daniels ?
Désolée.
On dirait que ça commence ŕ coaguler.
Est-ce que vous voulez une autre dose
pour la douleur ?
Ca ira.
Vous avez davantage besoin
des sédatifs que moi.
Combien de doses avez-vous prises ?
3.
Et vous tenez toujours debout ?
Est-ce que ça n'aurait pas
déjŕ du vous clouer sur place ?
Eh bien, un jour normal, je serais H-S pour
les 12 prochaines heures, mais aujourd'hui,
c'est ŕ peine suffisant pour
me maintenir sain d'esprit.
Merci...
pour prendre soin de Maia.
C'est une enfant adorable.
Ecoutez, Diana...
il me reste seulement 3 doses.
L'effet passe plus vite ŕ chaque fois,
donc...
je ne veux blesser personne. Je ne veux
tuer personne. Alors si je
commence ŕ partir...
Ne vous en faites pas.
Je m'occuperai de vous.
Faites-moi une faveur...
A l'arričre de la tęte, ok ?
Vous ne le verrez pas venir.
Ecoutez, Hudson...
Je viens de vous donner la permission
d’enfoncer mon crâne.
Appelez-moi Max.
Trčs bien, Max.
Ce signal...
laquelle de ces salopes
l'envoie d'aprčs vous ?
Je ne vois pas ce que ça a ŕ voir
avec quoi que ce soit.
Hé, tu voulais connaître mon histoire, non ?
Eh bien, en ce moment męme,
tu la vis.
Ouvre tes yeux.
Maintenant, imagine que 3 ans se sont
envolés pendant qu'ils étaient fermés.
Je ne peux pas.
Je ne le pouvais pas non plus...
mais ils sont partis.
J'ai manqué ma terminale, qui est
supposée ętre la meilleure année de la vie.
J'ai été spolié.
Le reste du lycée, c'était nul.
Donc ce trou de mémoire
que tu as eu au volant,
c'était un genre d'effet
secondaire du coma ?
Oui.
Waow.
Tu en as traversé, des épreuves.
Tu es jalouse ?
Quelle partie semble intéressante ?
Le coma ?
Le délit de fuite ?
Je suis jalouse
parce que tu as toute cette expérience
dans les tripes.
Ca te rend intéressant.
Mais je n'ai rien fait.
Ce n'est pas moi.
Génial, alors maintenant,
on peut me tuer dans mon sommeil.
Comment vous savez que
c'est l'une d'entre nous ?
Eh bien, je ne le sais pas,
mais aucune de vous ne parle,
alors je n'ai plus d'autre option.
Ca ne fera aucune espčce de différence.
Voilŕ.
Plus de sédatifs.
Vous vous sentez toujours capable
d'agir en tant que médecin ?
Pour l'instant.
On est un peu occupés, lŕ, Diana !
On a mis hors d'état de nuire les 4400,
mais on n’est pas sűrs
que ça ait arręté le signal.
Tu te sens encore survolté ?
Oui, en effet, ok ? Je travaille
sur le sujet de mon côté.
C'est quoi ce bruit ?
J'essaye de contrer les effets du signal.
Si tu pouvais la fermer pendant une seconde,
peut-ętre que je pourrais
trouver la bonne fréquence...
Ok, calme-toi Marco.
Tu dois continuer ŕ faire ça.
C'est toujours pour ma pomme, n'est-ce pas ?
Ce bon vieux et infaillible Marco
fait tout ce que tu veux.
Je crois sincčrement
ŕ ce que nous tentons de faire.
Les 4400 sont un prototype pour le
prochain niveau de l'évolution humaine.
Vous voulez bien reculer ?
Vous vous tenez un peu trop prčs.
Nous pouvons recréer la technologie
qu'ils ont utilisée pour nous changer.
Pas en chantant des "ommm" 3 fois, ça non.
Je suis d'accord…
Mais si vous venez travailler avec nous,
ça pourrait nous mener quelque part.
Vous savez,
le gouvernement
m'a approché une demi-douzaine de fois.
On dirait qu'ils ont cette drôle de théorie
selon laquelle je suis
le créateur de cette nouvelle partie
de la science. J'ai décliné leur offre.
Je n'aime pas travailler avec des gens
qui portent des badges.
Ecoutez, vous ne pouvez pas
leur en vouloir d'ętre curieux.
Vous étiez dans un hôpital psychiatrique
pendant... 6 ans ?
Le futur s'est décarcassé
pour vous faire fonctionner ŕ nouveau.
Je n'ai pas oublié mes dettes.
En plus, le gouvernement ne peut pas
vous offrir ce que je peux vous offrir.
Ah ? Quoi donc ?
Un bonus ŕ la signature ? Une voiture chic ?
Moi.
Je suis l'emblčme, n'est-ce pas ?
Les mains guérisseuses.
Accčs illimité.
Est-ce que vous pouvez vraiment refuser ça ?
Maman,
j'ai peur.
Je sais, ma puce.
J'ai peur aussi.
Mais tout va bien se passer,
puisque maman est lŕ.
D'accord ?
Quoi qu'il entre par cette porte...
je te protégerai.
Tom.
Tom... Baisse ton arme.
C'est moi, Diana.
Non, tu vas...
tu vas me tirer dessus si je la baisse.
Non, Tom. Je ne veux pas te faire de mal.
Moi si, Diana.
Tom... j'ai dit du calme.
Ma mčre a toujours voulu que je sorte
avec un docteur mignon,
mais faites encore un mouvement,
et j'appuie sur cette détente.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Ca doit ętre Marco qui gagne sa paye.
Je me sens idiote.
C'est juste que... Isabelle et moi avons été
tellement proches pendant si longtemps.
Et vous l'ętes toujours.
Je sais.
C'est ce que tu dis...
c'est un bébé. Ca n'a rien de personnel.
Oui, tu dois continuer ŕ t'en souvenir.
Hé, Ruth, regardez qui revoilŕ.
C'était un long déjeuner.
Oui, désolés.
On n'a pas fait attention ŕ l'heure.
Viens lŕ. On y est.
On reviendra la chercher dans une heure.
- Nous serons lŕ.
- Merci.
Bye, Isabelle.
J'aimerais faire un peu de
recherches pour la maison.
On pourrait jeter un oeil aux alentours,
pour voir ce qu'il y a.
Vous ętes le patron
jusqu'ŕ mon rétablissement.
Rassemblez toutes les forces
qui sont encore en état.
Commencez ŕ trouver des indices.
Je m'en occuperai.
Trčs bien. Et faites examiner votre tęte.
Comment tu te sens ?
Ben, pour une femme menue,
t'as un sacré punch.
Je ne veux pas tirer toute la couverture
ŕ moi. Culp t'avait déjŕ ramollit pas mal.
Hmmm
C'est le dernier pointage.
3 agents sont morts, 2 de la NSA, un 4400...
Commotions, os cassés, coups de couteau...
la vache.
C'est dur ŕ avaler. C'était une attaque
importante, et on n'étaient pas pręts.
Ouais.
Comment tu vas, chérie ?
Ok.
Pas si bien.
Je l'ai mise sous glucose et érythromycine.
On l'emmčne ŕ St Michael et on va voir
si on peut faire baisser cette fičvre.
Et l'éruption ?
Je vais faire appel ŕ un spécialiste.
Est-ce que je devrais m'inquiéter ?
Brett Kellerman est un des meilleurs
dermatologues de la ville.
Je suis sűr qu'il va trouver.
Tu viens avec nous,
hein ?
Bien sűr.
Je serai lŕ dans l'ambulance avec toi.
Trčs bien,
j'arrive ŕ l'hôpital dčs que possible.
Ok.
- Oh, Max...
- Oui ?
Merci pour tout.
Non, merci ŕ vous, pour...
ne pas m'avoir logé une balle dans le crâne.
Alors ces 4400 que Diana protégeait...
ils ne reverront pas la lumičre du jour
jusqu'ŕ ce que le NTAC soit sűr
qu'ils ne sont pas responsables.
Ca va ętre un débriefing marathon.
Oui, je vous parie qu'elles seront
toutes les deux debout toute la nuit.
Deux ?
Je croyais que Diana avait dit
qu'elles étaient trois.
Tom ?
Elle est partie.
Une 4400 a presque mis ŕ terre une
installation fortifiée du gouvernement,
et a réussi ŕ s'enfuir
sans verser une goutte de sueur.
Y a un nom pour ça ?
Oui, terrorisme.
Ca fait mal de se prendre le retour, hein ?
Bienvenue au Centre.
Vous voulez vous inscrire pour la visite ?
Non.
Dites ŕ Shawn Farrell que Kevin Burkhoff
veut le voir.
Je suis désolée.
M. Farrell est occupé pour le moment.
Puis-je lui transmettre un message ?
Oui.
Je veux commencer immédiatement.
Tu peux rester si tu veux.
On peut dîner,
étudier un peu...
Kyle ?
Est-ce que ça va ?
Je ne te mérite pas.
C'est trop mignon.
Je reviens.
Ok.
Shawn...
Voici Olivia Cohen.
Asseyez-vous ici.
Hm-hmmm.
C'est bien.
Elle a perdu la vue ŕ cause d'une
dégénérescence de la cornée il y a 10 ans.
La fondation a été trčs émue
par son histoire.
Bonjour, Mme Cohen.
Bonjour.
Ravi de vous rencontrer.
Donc, euh...
Ce qu'on va faire maintenant
va vous paraître un peu étrange, mais
quand nous en aurons fini,
vous pourrez voir ŕ nouveau.
Je suis impatiente.
Je dois admettre,
que je suis un peu nerveuse.
C'est inutile.
Je vais prendre vos mains maintenant,
d'accord ?
Hm hmmm.
Nous y voilŕ.
Nous y voilŕ.
Quand est-ce qu'on commence ?
Quand est-ce que je vais voir ŕ nouveau ?
Donnez-moi un instant.
Shawn ?
Oh...
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il fait chaud ici ou c'est moi ?

Pendant ces 60 dernières années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées
Elles ont été renvoyées
toutes ensemble
Sans aucun souvenir
de l'endroit où elles étaient
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un seul jour
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des pouvoirs
Toutes tentent de se reconnecter...
... avec leur vie passée
Nous ne sommes pas la menace,
nous sommes le remède.
Le monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans les 4400...
C'est là où je sors mon speech comme quoi
vous êtes ma meilleure
scientifique de terrain
et Tom mon meilleur enquêteur,
et comment ensemble,
vous allez former une bonne équipe.
Voyons voir si j'ai bien tout compris...
vous deux vous vous êtes rencontrés,
êtes tombés amoureux,
et avez passé 8 ans dans une sorte
de réalité alternative.
Oui.
A quelle heure est le vol ?
Euh, midi.
Dis au revoir à maman de ma part.
Ils ont arrêté un suspect il y a 40 minutes.
Ils prétendent que c'est notre gars.
Roy Keith Mardsen.
Laisse tomber l'avion.
Ramène Kyle à la maison.
Ils viennent d'arrêter un suspect
dans le meurtre de Collier.
Ca va faire un peu bizarre,
mais quand on aura fini,
vous serez en mesure de voir à nouveau.
Quand est-ce que ça commence ?
Quand est-ce que je vois de nouveau ?
Donnez moi un instant, ok ?
Kevin est un génie, vous savez.
Tu es en train de dire que Burkhoff est
le père de la technologie des 4400.
Je peux penser à nouveau, aussi.
Tu as une sacrée fièvre, jeune fille.
J'ai travaillé au CDC pendant 7 ans,
et je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel.
Je la changeais.
Elle avait ces marques sur la peau.
Des marques ? Des éraflures ?
Non. Comme des irritations.
Comme si quelqu'un
l'avait accrochée à quelque chose.
Qu'est-ce que je viens de te dire ?
Vous avez les commandes
jusqu'à ce que je sois rétablie.
Rassemble tous les hommes
qui peuvent encore marcher.
Commencez à recoller les morceaux.
Je m'en chargerai. Ne vous inquiétez pas.
Ok, sérieusement,
mon dos va bientôt dire stop.
Allez...
tu ne nous aides pas. Où est-ce que ça va ?
Juste ici.
S'il te plait dis moi que
c'est la dernière boite.
C'est bon.
On vit officiellement dans le péché.
Oh, vraiment. Et bien je préfère appeler ça
"la reprise de nos 8 années de mariage".
Appelle le comme tu veux.
Mais ne vous embrassez pas devant moi, ok ?
C'est dégoûtant.
Oh, ton père pense que c'est si romantique,
mais ce qu'il ne sait pas
c'est que j'ai emménagé ici pour bazarder
son vieux matériel de golf.
Quoi ?
Pour les remplacer avec quoi ? Oh oh,
tes gribouillages de peinture ?
Peut-être une photo d'un triangle.
- Les enfants !
- C'est de l'art.
Réglez vos problèmes de déco entre vous,
mais je suis vraiment sérieux au sujet
de la règle des baisers, ok ?
Ce n'est pas négociable.
Oh, Kyle,
mes allergies continuent à me gêner.
Pourrais tu me faire une ordonnance
avant que je m'en aille ?
Euh, Alana...
Kyle est un médecin seulement dans le monde
que tu as créé pour moi, tu te souviens ?
Je suis désolée.
J'avais un mal de crâne.
Ok.
Vous essayez de décrypter mon écriture ?
J'étais à deux doigts
d'abandonner à vrai dire ?
Une mauvaise écriture est le meilleur moyen
pour un médecin de garder son côté mystique.
Il y a une page manquante dedans.
Ca va de la page 4 à la 6.
Désolé.
J'ai engagé une infirmière débutante.
Donc écoutez, je pense qu'on sait enfin
ce qui ne va pas chez votre fille.
Maia souffre d'un type de pneumonie
appelée pneumocystis jiroveci
"P. J. P." pour faire court.
Je n'en ai jamais entendu parler.
C'est rare, mais on peut la traiter.
dieu merci.
Mais ce genre de pneumonie pourrait être un
symptôme pour quelque chose de plus sérieux.
On l'a testé pour tous les virus...
tous négatifs.
D'où est-ce que ça vient alors ?
On ne sait pas, mais on fait plus de tests.
On va trouver.
Ce n'est pas si important.
Tu sais, j'ai juste... j'ai travaillé
vraiment dur dernièrement.
Je pense que j'ai la grippe
ou un truc dans le genre.
Ca arrive à tout le monde, non ?
Bien sûr. C'est juste que...
Shawn...
tu ne peux pas guérir.
Pour le moment.
Je pense que tu devrais te faire examiner.
Si je ne m'en débarrasse pas dans
un jour ou deux, je le ferai,
mais euh, en attendant,
peux-tu reprogrammer tous mes
rendez-vous pour la fondation ?
Dis leur que c'est temporaire.
Assures toi qu'ils sachent ça.
L ily...
Ne dis à personne que
je ne peux plus soigner.
Bien  sûr.
Merci.
L ily...
Je suis sérieux. Personne.
Oh, mon dieu.
Combien sont malades ?
300...
dont on est au courant. Les médecins
disent que les appels continuent d'affluer.
Qu'est-ce que c'est alors ?
Et bien, c'est une sorte de
trouble du système immunitaire,
qui laisse les 4400 vulnérables
à tous genres de maladies.
Son avion a atterri à Seatac
à l'heure prévue.
L'hélicoptère devrait arriver ici
très bientôt.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Ils m'ont dit qu'il aime le thé vert.
Est-ce contagieux ?
On ne sait pas.
Est-ce qu'ils ont été affectés
quand ils étaient partis ?
Peut-être qu'ils ont ramené ça avec eux.
Et bien, peut-être. On n'en sait rien.
La situation est instable mais voici un
résumé de ce que nous savons jusqu'à présent
Euh, monsieur ?
Ils m'ont dit que vous voudriez ça.
Les chiffres continuent d'augmenter.
Donc on est en train de se remettre
d'une attaque contre le bâtiment...
le chef de la division
est encore à l'hôpital...
Qu'est-ce qu'on est censé faire ?
On va sur le terrain.
Ryland ?
D'où est-ce qu'il sort ?
On va faire tester tous les 4400 de cette
juridiction avant la fin de la journée.
Dennis, content de vous voir.
Tom.
Diana.
Qu'est-ce qui vous amène à Seattle, Ryland ?
Je prends temporairement le commandement
de cette division.
Mes ordres sont de faire quelque chose pour
empêcher la propagation de cette épidémie.
Je vais trouver un moyen d'y parvenir.
Vous devriez enlever ça,
à moins que vous vouliez que
les gens vous appellent "Nina".
Comment va Jarvis ?
Ils ont replacé la clavicule.
Les médecins disent qu'elle sera
de retour dans 2 semaines.
Ce que je pense ? Plutôt une semaine.
Oui.
Donc, comment c'est Washington ?
Oh, beaucoup d'interconnexions.
Beaucoup de dîners.
Patty adore ça.
Et vous ?
Le nord-ouest pacifique
est le point critique.
J'ai comme le sentiment d'avoir
été promu hors de la partie.
Beaucoup de gars échangeraient
leurs places avec vous.
Je ne les blâmerais pas.
Une femme libère un fléau dans l'air ?
Une attaque terroriste contre le bâtiment ?
Les gens pour qui je travaille pensent
que vous êtes en pleine guerre.
Je suis sûr que ça en a l'air sur le papier.
Ne soyez pas sur la défensive.
Je prêche toujours le gospel
à Highland Beach.
Je crois toujours que les 4400 sont revenus
pour rendre les choses meilleures.
Oui et les gens pour qui vous travaillez ?
Ne vous inquiétez pas d'eux.
Un jour, tout ceci sera fini,
on ira boire une bière,
on reparlera du passé, on échangera
des histoires de guerre.
Oui.
Elle est un peu capricieuse ce matin.
Je pense qu'elle a une autre dent qui pousse
Elles arrivent vite, hein ?
C'est l'âge.
Bye, bye, chérie.
On se voit demain.
Merci, Ruth.
Lily, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je croyais qu'on était d'accord,
que personne ne faisait d'expériences
scientifiques sur notre bébé.
Je ne faisais que m'en assurer.
Shawn, nous devons réorganiser
votre calendrier de guérison.
Il y a quelque chose qui se passe,
une sorte de maladie
qui se répand chez les 4400.
Je suis déjà au courant.
Vous.
Est-ce que c'est vous qui avez fait ça ?
Non, non. Ce n'est pas moi.
Alors que faites vous là ?
J'ai lu quelque chose sur cet endroit dans
un journal. J'étais juste... juste curieux.
Oui ? Et bien, allez être curieux ailleurs,
parce que des gens vivent toujours ici, ok ?
Avez vous besoin d'aide ?
Quoi, vous êtes mécanicien ?
Je peux changer une roue.
Il y a sûrement un cric dans le coffre,
n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Je suis désolée
de vous avoir parlé sur ce ton.
Je suis juste... je suis pressée, et...
le petit frère de mon petit ami est encore
dans le bureau du proviseur, et il n'est…
pas là... encore.
Je suppose qu'il a pas mal de problèmes,
hein ?
Oui.
Oui, on peut dire ça.
Et bien je veux dire, ce ne sont
pas mes affaires. Je peux juste
changer la roue et partir.
S'il vous plait.
Bonjour. Bienvenue au Centre.
Est-ce que vous venez pour la visite ?
C'est faux.
Tout est faux.
Excusez moi ?
C'est le musée Collier.
Où sont tous les tableaux ?
Thomas.
Hey, chérie. Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
J'ai une réunion du conseil de direction,
et ils ne me laissent pas monter.
Oui, oui, ils m'ont appelé.
Ils ont dit que tu étais un peu confuse.
Alana...
Ce n'est pas le musée Collier.
C'est... c'est le centre des 4400.
De quoi est-ce que tu parles ?
Je viens tout le temps ici.
Regarde moi.
Alana...
L'endroit auquel tu penses,
il est autre part.
Non. Non !
Pourquoi est-ce que tu m'embrouilles ?
- Calme toi !
- Non !
C'est bon. Tout va bien.
Le taux d'infection est de 18%.
Un sur cinq est déjà malade ?
Un sur cinq aujourd'hui. Demain...
l'institut national sanitaire
s'inquiète du fait que cette maladie,
peu importe ce que c'est,
puisse muter et se transmettre
au reste de la population.
Est-ce qu'elle aurait à muter au moins ?
Il n'y a pas de garantie qu'elle
reste l'exclusivité des 4400,
et pendant ce temps, on a des douzaines
de malades juste en bas.
Ils ne vont pas rester là-bas longtemps.
Pourquoi ? Qu'allez vous faire d'eux ?
Washington veut remettre
tous les 4400 en quarantaine
et les garder jusqu'à la fin de la crise.
Je sais que c'est une décision difficile,
mais c'est la meilleure
qu'on ait pour le moment.
Est-ce qu'on peut faire ça ?
D'après l'ordre 74 de quarantaine d'urgence,
oui on peut.
Mais attendez, on ne parle que des malades,
n'est-ce pas ?
Non.
Tous.
Chaque 4400 dans ce pays
est soumis à cet ordre.
Ok, mais ça n'en fait que la moitié,
cette chose est mondiale, n'est-ce pas ?
L'Angleterre et la France
font passer des législations similaires.
On s'attend à ce que
les autres pays suivent.
Mais pourquoi est-ce qu'on
les force tous à venir ?
Parce que la maladie semble
se manifester au hasard.
Jusqu'à ce qu'on comprenne
comment elle se transmet,
on  doit présumer que chaque 4400
est un vecteur potentiel.
Combien de temps leur donne-t-on ?
On fera l'annonce dans la matinée.
Ils auront 12 heures pour se présenter
dans un bureau local du NTAC,
puis ils seront transférés à Camp Dekker
et au centre de quarantaine.
Et s'ils ne se présentent pas ?
Alors ce sera à nous de les ramener.
Vous ne m'avez pas bien entendu...
c'est temporaire.
En êtes vous sûr ?
Vous nous avez déjà dit que les gens à
Washington pensent que nous sommes en guerre
Washington est plein d'opinions.
La ville vit grâce à eux.
Les 4400 ne sont pas que
des noms dans des rapports...
et ne sont définitivement pas
des combattants ennemis.
Vous parlez de ma fille, du neveu de Tom...
la femme que j'aime.
J'allais vous le dire en buvant cette bière.
Maintenant, quelles assurances pouvez
vous nous donner que ces gens
ne vont pas être jeté
dans un trou pour toujours ?
Vous avez mon assurance,
et ça devrait suffire.
J'étais celui qui a fait pression pour les
laisser sortir, vous vous souvenez ?
Nous n'essayons pas
de vous critiquer, Dennis,
mais les gens que l'on aime sont malades.
Je comprends,
mais les rassembler tous au même endroit
va faciliter les choses
pour trouver ce que c'est.
Quand ce sera fini,
tout le monde rentrera chez lui.
On sait que vous menez le bon combat,
Dennis.
J'espère juste que vous pouvez gagner.
Maman ?
Tu es réveillée.
Comment vas-tu bébé ?
J'en ai marre d'être malade.
Quand est-ce que je peux rentrer ?
Pourquoi est-ce que tu ne me le dis pas ?
J'espérais en quelque sorte
que tu aies une vision,
sur quand tout ceci sera fini.
Elles ne viennent plus.
Je ne vois pas de choses.
Ma patiente préférée est réveillée.
Plus réveillée que vous n'en avez l'air.
Mm.
Ouvre grand.
Je fais du meilleur travail quand
je me passe totalement de sommeil.
Et bien, si vous avez besoin de quelqu'un
pour vous jeter de l'eau froide,
faites  moi savoir.
Merci.
Vous permettez ?
J'ai remarqué que la page manquante
est revenue.
Oh, oui.
Je vous avis dit qu'elle reviendrait.
Quelles sont ces deux lignes noircies ?
On dirait qu'on a doublé un test.
Ils l'ont barré afin qu'on ne lise
pas les mêmes résultats deux fois.
Ok, voyons comment va cette éruption.
Je vais bien, Brian.
Dis à Heidi ne pas s'inquiéter.
Richard va bien.
Isabelle va bien.
Et bien, on croirait que tout le monde
est malade d'après les journaux.
Les gens sont terrifiés,
et si les gens normaux
commencent à être malades...
"Les gens normaux" ?
Ok, ce n’était pas comme ça que je voulais
le dire, mais tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Et écoute, Lily,
Heidi n'est pas la seule inquiète pour toi.
Je le suis aussi.
Il y a un an et demi, tu m'as accueilli
avec un ordre restrictif.
Je sais.
J'ai paniqué quand tu es revenue.
Ne pense pas que j'ai pu dormir
avec ce que j'ai fait.
Je veux juste que tu saches maintenant
que je suis là pour toi.
Toi, Richard, Isabelle.
Si tu as besoin de quoi que ce soit...
appelle moi.
"Quarantaine".
C'est un mot évocateur en ce moment.
Il évoque des images
de prisons secrètes et...
quel euphémisme utilisez vous maintenant ?
"Tactiques coercitives" ?
Laissez moi vous demander quelque chose...
Vous avez des médecins ici, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Ils ont pu trouver la source du problème ?
Pas encore.
Alors descendez de votre estrade.
Vous voulez une image
à laquelle vous accrocher ?
Essayez celle-ci...
des 4400 mourant en masse.
Je pense que ce que mon partenaire
essaie de vous dire, c'est que
nos 2 organisations devraient s'entraider.
Nous devrions coopérer.
Et comment fait-on ça exactement ?
On veut faire paraître un communiqué public.
Si le centre conseille au 4400
de se plier à cet ordre,
les choses se passeront plus calmement.
Et si on refuse ?
Pourquoi est-ce qu'on vous parle
de toute façon ? Où est Shawn ?
Est-ce qu'il va bien ?
Mr. Farrell est en train de
s'occuper d'affaires urgentes.
Cette situation demande
son entière attention.
E coutez,
il faudra qu'il l'approuve d'abord, mais
je ne vois pas de problèmes
à ce que les 4400 malades
aillent chercher des soins
médicaux auprès du NTAC.
Bon, c'est un début.
Et pour ceux qui n'ont pas de symptômes ?
Ce sujet va demander plus de réflexion.
Super. Vous avez 12 heures.
A quoi ça sert de repeindre de toute façon ?
Ils vont recommencer.
On n'en sait rien. Ecoute, Sam,
Kyle a été assez gentil pour venir ici
et nous aider,
donc le moins que tu puisses faire
est de t'y mettre.
Oh, oui, très bien... Picasso.
Je vais faire des sandwichs.
Ok,
sérieusement, c'est quoi ton histoire ?
Pourquoi tu nous aides,
Kyle qui-que-tu-sois ?
Mon nom est Bingham...
et je ne sais pas.
Je me promenais par ici hier.
Alison semblait avoir
besoin d'un coup de main...
Ouais et bien si tu penses te mettre
avec elle, laisse tomber.
Alison va se marier avec mon frère
dès qu'il sortira de prison.
Je sais. Je sais. Elle me l'a dit.
Tu devrais l'écouter.
Roy n'a pas tué ce Collier.
Je te crois.
Oui ?
Et bien tu es le seul.
Toi et moi.
Quand il sortira,
je ne pense pas que tu veuilles
qu'il revienne ici et voit "assassin"
écrit sur sa porte, n'est-ce pas ?
Richard...
Tu es prêt pour une promotion ?
Moi ?
Une promotion pour quoi ?
J'essaye, là, mec.
Je veux nous diriger pour traverser ça,
mais je ne peux pas le faire maintenant.
Merci.
Je suis un 4400, c'est vrai, mais à part ça,
mes qualifications sont assez minces.
Ils ne m'ont même pas donné de pouvoir.
Et pour être honnête avec vous,
je ne sais pas combien de temps Lily
et moi avons prévu de rester ici.
Donc ça ne convient pas parfaitement,
mais vous vous exprimez bien,
et vous êtes un héros de guerre,
et vous avec les épaules d'un leader.
Je pense que c'est une bonne idée.
Je n'ai pas donné un ordre depuis 1951.
J'étais au lycée il y a un an et demi.
J'y suis arrivé.
Vous le ferez tout aussi bien.
Mais c'est seulement temporaire,
n'est-ce pas ? Dés que
vous irez mieux, je pourrai
retourner dans les coulisses.
Oui.
Temporairement.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Ce que je dois faire.
Cette maladie effraye tout le monde,
et c'est compréhensible.
Mais personne n'est aussi effrayé
que nous le sommes.
Et ceci parce que, malgré toutes les rumeurs
que vous pouvez entendre aux alentours,
seuls les 4400 tombent malades.
Et maintenant, le gouvernement
exige que nous nous placions en quarantaine.
Ils disent que la coopération
est essentielle.
Alors,
voilà ce que nous pouvons faire de mieux...
Si vous êtes malade,
la chose à faire est de le signaler au NTAC.
Vous avez notre soutien,
et nos prières vont vers vous.
Mais si vous allez bien,
si vous ne montrez aucun symptôme,
nous vous demandons
de prendre en compte ceci...
entrer en quarantaine est facile,
mais en sortir...
cela pourrait se révéler bien plus dur.
Merci.
Ils ne comprennent pas ?
On essaye d'aider ces gens.
Tout ce qu'ils entendent
c'est "quarantaine", Dennis.
Vous ne pouvez pas leur
en vouloir d'avoir peur.
Peut-être que si on leur donne une autre
journée, même une demi-journée.
Selon vous, ils n'ont pas encore
pris leur décision ?
Nous avons essayé d'être raisonnables.
Dans 10 heures, nous commencerons
à aller les chercher.
Salut.
Bonjour.
Je sais qui vous êtes.
Vous êtes la personne qui répare les gens.
Ouais.
Shawn.
Comment ça se fait que vous êtes ici ?
Pourquoi vous ne vous guérissez pas
vous-même ?
J'aimerais pouvoir.
Elles sont cassées.
Un peu comme le reste.
Je voyais des choses.
Des choses qui allaient arriver.
C'est fini aussi maintenant.
C'est drôle, non ?
Quand j'ai découvert que j'étais différent,
tout ce que je voulais
c'était être à nouveau normal.
Moi aussi.
Mais on s'habitue.
Maintenant que c'est parti,
c'est comme s'il me manquait un bras.
Ca reviendra.
Dès qu'on ira mieux.
Tu as une idée de quand ça va arriver ?
Pas exactement,
mais ma maman m'a dit que tout allait
bien se passer,
et je crois ce qu'elle dit.
Ca doit être un sentiment agréable.
Tu n'as personne en qui croire ?
Avant, oui...
mais maintenant, je crois que je vais devoir
croire en toi.
Vous êtes celui que
j'ai attaqué à l'hôpital ?
On ne pensait pas que
vous vous souviendriez de nous.
Je me souviens.
J'étais...
très malade à l'époque.
Je vais mieux maintenant.
Diana, vous vouliez me voir ?
Kevin Burkhoff.
Je fais des recherches neurologiques
sur les 4400.
J'ai entendu parler de vous.
Comme tout le monde ici.
Voilà.
Il y a des données très intéressantes
dans les recherches que j'ai
mené sur leur sang. Regardez.
Voyez si ça peut vous aider à trouver
ce qui se passe avec cette maladie.
Eh bien, merci.
Je vais éplucher ça.
Bien,
et j'attends de voir votre travail...
alors, quand ?
Je vous ai montré le mien.
Vous me montrez le vôtre.
C'est comme ça que ça marche, non ?
D'habitude oui, mais les recherches
qu'on fait ici sont confidentielles.
Max...
Max, s'il doit y avoir un moment
pour enfreindre un peu les règles,
que ce soit maintenant.
Un petit coup de coude et un clin d'oeil
ne suffiront pas, Diana.
Si je donne des documents confidentiels,
je vais en prison.
Oui, et si vous ne le faites pas,
des gens pourraient mourir.
Vous sous-entendez que nous ne faisons
pas tout ce que nous pouvons ?
Il y a des douzaines de médecins
qui travaillent 24h/24
pour essayer de résoudre ce problème.
Je...
je vais regarder tout
ce que vous m'avez donné.
Si je trouve quoi que ce soit
qui puisse vous aider,
je vous appellerai.
C'est le mieux que je puisse faire.
Je suis vraiment désolée...
Vos excuses ne m'intéressent pas.
Je veux avoir accès à ces informations.
A moins que le NTAC ne soit pas intéressé
par guérir ces gens ?
Je sais que vous êtes enthousiastes
lorsqu'il s'agit de risquer vos carrières,
mais rendez-moi service...
arrêtez de me demander
de me joindre à vous, ok ?
Moi j'aime bien mon job.
Ce sont des dossiers médicaux, Marco.
Pas des secrets d'état.
Erreur. Ce sont des dossiers médicaux
et des secrets d'état.
Voilà pourquoi ils sont gardés
dans une base de données
pour laquelle vous avez
besoin de 6 mots de passe.
et c'est pour ça que Mr Muscle
ne vous les donnera pas.
Laissons Max en dehors de ça.
Il subit beaucoup de pression.
Et il veut garder son boulot.
Je ne le blâme pas.
Je viens d'ouvrir un plan épargne retraite.
Et je suis presque sur que le gouvernement
arrête d'abonder dessus
quand vous avez trahi le pays.
Le gouvernement vient de décliner une
offre d'aide de la part de Kevin Burkhoff.
Tu te souviens de lui ?
Tu sais, le futur avait construit
une tour géante pour le réveiller.
Je pense qu'ils croyaient
qu'il avait de l'importance.
Quiconque à Washington a lu mon rapport
sait aussi qu'il a de l'importance.
C'est bizarre.
Des centaines de gens sont malades.
On pourrait penser qu'ils veulent toute
l'aide qu'ils peuvent trouver.
Eh bien, ils auront son aide.
Qu'ils la veuillent ou non.
Pigé.
Hé !
Isabelle est prête pour sa promenade ?
Ok, allons nous amuser.
Depuis combien de temps est-elle là-dedans ?
Je ne sais pas, 5 minutes.
Je suis venue te chercher
dès que j'ai vu ça.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils lui font là-dedans ?
Recule.
Vous voulez bien nous excuser ?
Depuis combien de temps ça dure ?
Richard, votre fille n'a jamais été
en danger d'aucune sorte.
Il vous a posé une question.
Jordan allait commencer ces tests dès
qu'il vous aurait convaincu de revenir ici.
Quels tests ?
Qu'est-ce que vous lui faites ?
Tout ce que nous faisons, c'est ce que
vous auriez du faire depuis longtemps...
essayer de découvrir qui est Isabelle,
ou plutôt ce qu'elle est.
C'est notre fille. C'est tout ce que vous,
ou quiconque avez à savoir.
Votre fille est la pierre de Rosette
qui permet de comprendre ce qui est arrivé
aux 4400, même si vous deux
vous accrochez à l'illusion
qu'elle ira à la maternelle,
qu'elle fera sa communion,
ou qu'elle ira au bal de promo.
Elle n'appartient pas à la communauté. Nous
sommes ses parents, c'est nous qui décidons.
Ses parents ?
Vous êtes les garants de l'avenir,
et pardonnez-moi de dire ça,
mais vous êtes pitoyables dans ce rôle.
Nous avons tout abandonné pour cette enfant,
toutes nos chances de vivre une vie normale,
pour la protéger de gens comme vous.
Ecoutez, Richard, ce n'est pas le moment
d'avoir cette conversation.
Dans 2 heures, le gouvernement va arriver
par la grande porte.
Oui, eh bien, vous n'utiliserez pas ma fille
comme une sorte d'arme contre eux.
Ca n'a jamais été mon intention.
Vous n'en aurez jamais l'occasion.
Nous partons sur-le-champ.
C'est votre choix. mais si vous faites ça,
si on se sépare maintenant,
ils rafleront les 4400 un par un,
et cette communauté sera finie.
Hé.
Hé, Thomas.
Hé.
Ils ont dit que tu m'avais demandé.
Tu ne devrais pas être au lit ?
Ils m'y remettront bien assez tôt.
Je voulais te voir.
Comment tu te sens, ma chérie ?
Ils ne peuvent pas faire baisser la fièvre,
mais...
le pire, c'est dans ma tête.
Tout est tellement confus.
Cette maladie,
ça affecte le pouvoir des gens.
Maia n'a plus de prédictions, et…
et Shawn, Shawn ne peut plus guérir,
et en ce qui te concerne, chérie,
je pense que les barrières
entre ce monde et celui que tu avais créé
sont en train de s'effondrer.
C'est tellement perturbant.
Je ne sais plus ce qui est réel.
Je sais que c'est effrayant.
Tu dois t'accrocher.
Ils vont réparer ça.
Et s'ils y arrivent trop tard ?
Et s'ils peuvent guérir mon corps,
mais pas mon esprit ?
Je ne veux pas vivre comme ça, Thomas.
Ca n'arrivera pas. Tu vas aller mieux.
Tu dois y croire, Alana.
Thomas...
Oui ?
Je t'aime tellement.
Je voulais qu'on se marie en vrai,
dans ce monde.
C'est tout ce que je voulais te dire,
avant...
avant que mon esprit s'en aille...
parce que...
je ne sais pas s'il fonctionnera à nouveau.
Tu es sûr que tu ne veux pas une bière,
ou autre chose ?
Non, non, c'est bon. Je ne bois pas.
D'accord.
Tu sais, ce n'est pas vraiment nécessaire.
Je n'ai fait que quelques travaux.
Ce n'est peut-être rien pour toi, mais
ça faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas
vu un visage amical, pas depuis...
que Roy est parti.
euh...
je ne veux pas t'offenser,
mais euh...
les journaux le présentent comme
le nouveau Lee Harvey Oswald.
Oui. Je n'appellerais pas ça
du journalisme juste et impartial.
Mais il avait une gigantesque collection
d'armes, n'est-ce pas ?
Je ne dis pas qu'il était un parfait
petit employé de bureau, et
il n'était certainement pas
le meilleur petit copain du monde.
Mais s'en prendre à 2 agents du NTAC et
abattre Jordan Collier ? Je t'en prie.
Bien sur.
Ouais.
Mange.
Sam !
Sam, amène-toi ! On commence.
J'arrive.
Hé.
Ok.
Vous êtes Marco ?
Merci.
Ne me remerciez pas.
Engagez-moi.
Je vais avoir besoin d'un boulot.
Où est-ce que tu étais ?
Je suis allé parler à Matthew.
Lily...
Il a une idée pour empêcher la rafle.
Je pense que ça pourrait marcher.
Je suis sûre qu'il est plein
d'idées intelligentes.
On s'occupera de ce que Matthew a fait,
mais pas maintenant.
Le gouvernement va déclarer la loi martiale
à propos de tout ça,
on n’a pas le temps pour ces chamailleries.
Tout ce que je veux entendre, c'est que
tu en as fini avec cet endroit, pour de bon.
Ce n'est pas si simple.
On ne peut pas s'en aller comme ça et
se cacher quelque part dans les bois.
Ca ne marchera pas cette fois.
Le Centre nous a trahi.
Il a trahi notre fille.
Et ils ont appris des choses
à propos d'elle,
plus que nous en presque un an.
Lily, arrête.
Tu savais qu'Isabelle avait des connexions
entre les hémisphères droit et gauche de son
cerveau que personne n'a jamais vu avant ?
Même si c'est vrai, Richard...
ce n'est pas qu'ils l'aient étudiée.
C'est comment ils l'ont fait.
Tu fais confiance au gouvernement ?
Parce que si nous allons en quarantaine,
Isabelle atterrira ici, ou avec eux,
et s'ils découvrent ce qu'elle peut faire...
on la perdra pour toujours.
Ca y est. C'est le moment.
Par où est-ce qu'on commence ?
Je veux que tout le monde garde
son arme dans son étui.
Mon but est de faire ça dans le calme,
tranquillement, et sans incident.
Et s'ils cherchent un incident ?
Alors on leur en donnera un.
Tout le monde est prêt ?
Allons-y.
Bienvenue au Centre.
Vous souhaitez faire une visite ?
Bon sang,
vous savez bien pourquoi on est là.
Nous débusquer je suppose.
J'ai bien peur que vous vous soyez
trompés d'endroit.
Vous êtes bien sur invités à chercher,
mais il n'y a aucun 4400 ici.
Je n'ai aucune idée de l'endroit
où ils sont allés.
Vous aviez 120 des 4400 qui
trouvaient refuge dans votre Centre.
Ca me parait exact.
Je n'ai pas le chiffre en tête.
Vous êtes descendu, et ils étaient partis ?
Jusqu'à 19h, ils restaient
des citoyens libres.
Je n'avais aucune raison de
surveiller leurs faits et gestes.
et puisque je n'ai violé aucune loi,
à moins que vous ne vouliez parler
de lever l'ordre de quarantaine,
nous n'avons rien d'autre à discuter.
On en reparlera.
Je suppose que votre travail va devenir
un peu plus ingrat à partir de maintenant,
frapper aux portes, et autre.
Si je travaillais au NTAC,
je passerais un peu moins de temps à essayer
de retrouver les 4400 manquants,
et un peu plus à essayer
de soigner ceux que j'ai.
Dites-moi, est-ce qu'on a une liste des 4400
qui ne se sont pas encore signalés ?
Oui.
Tous ceux que nous savons malades sont ici.
Pour le reste, environ 75% se sont pliés
à notre injonction.
Dans tout le pays, il y a environ 520
4400 qui ne se sont pas présentés.
Eh bien, ce n'est pas qu'une petite
résistance. C'est une rébellion.
Alors ça y est ?
Nous contre eux.
Vous savez,
ça ressemble fort à la guerre que
Jordan Collier a toujours prédite.
Prédite ou provoquée ?
On a déclaré la loi martiale pour eux.
Nous n'avions pas le choix.
Je vais continuer à prôner
une politique de non-agression,
aussi longtemps que je le pourrai,
Mais si le choix se présente entre
la sécurité du peuple Américain
et le bien-être des 4400, Tom...
ce n'est même pas un choix.
Collier a laissé 37 abris
à travers le pays.
Nous avons liquidé le fond secret
du Centre ce matin.
Ca devrait nous durer un moment.
Tout 4400 qui contactera le Centre
pour lui demander de l'aide
se verra communiquer une adresse e-mail.
Si l'on est convaincu de sa légitimité,
on lui dira où se rendre.
Notre but est d'assurer la sécurité
de chaque 4400 qui demandera asile.
Et ensuite ?
Matthew va tenter de mettre fin à ça
pacifiquement,
mais si nous devons nous protéger...
nous serons prêts.
Excusez-moi.
Excusez-moi. Pardon.
Lily...
Excellent discours,
mais on n’est pas en Corée ici,
et ce ne sont pas des soldats,
et ta fille pourrait être prise
dans des tirs croisés.
Tu penses que je ne
m'inquiète pas pour elle ?
et pour toi aussi ?
Lily, je ne cherche pas la bataille,
mais là, tout de suite,
nous n'avons pas d'autre choix.
- Hé. Sam a dit qu'il aimait les comics...
- Sale enfoiré !
Tu m'as menti.
Quoi ? Attends une seconde.
Ce n'était pas dans ce but.
Ah, vraiment, "Kyle Bingham" ?
Ton nom c'est Baldwin,
et ton père bosse au NTAC.
Alors, tu es qui ? Son petit espion, hein ?
Tu pensais pouvoir coucher avec moi ?
Que j'allais tout te dire à propos de Roy ?
Vas-t'en, et dis à ton père
qu'il n'a tué personne.
Je le sais.
J'essayais juste de t'aider.
Pourquoi ?
Tu t'es pointé comme si
t'étais un garçon sympa,
et tout ce que t'essayais de faire c'était
te servir de moi. T'es un putain de menteur.
Ok.
Ok.
Cette chose qui les tue,
ce n'est pas une infection.
C'est un effet secondaire.
Dr. Burkhoff, calmez-vous. De quoi
est-ce que vous parlez ?
Un effet secondaire de quoi ?
Je ne sais pas exactement,
mais il y a une chose dont je suis sur...
il y a une substance synthétique
dans le sang de tous les 4400,
tous ceux que j'ai testés,
dans tous les dossiers médicaux
que vous m'avez donné, malades
ou en bonne santé, peu importe.
Ils l'ont tous.
Ils lui ont même donné un nom.
Ils appellent ça "inhibiteur de promicine".
Promicine ? Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Je n'en ai aucune idée,
et je ne sais pas non plus pourquoi
quelqu'un voudrait l'inhiber, d'ailleurs.
Mais quoi que ce soit, ça se rassemble
dans leurs ganglions lymphatiques,
ce qui atteint leur système immunitaire...
c'est ce qui les rend malades.
Mais le NTAC étudie les 4400 depuis qu'ils
sont revenus, Ils auraient du le savoir.
Ils le savent.
Tout est ici. Ils savent.
Alors pourquoi ils ne l'ont dit à personne ?
C'est une excellente question.
Quand vous aurez la réponse,
faites-le moi savoir.
Vous êtes sûre de vouloir faire ça ?
Emmenez-moi simplement Isabelle
et moi dans un endroit sûr.
"Dosage d'I. P."... C'est dans les mémos,
dans tous les rapports médicaux des 4400.
C'est dans la 5ème page
de tous les dossiers.
C'est ce que Hudson avait barré
quand je suis venue voir Maia.
"I. P."
"Inhibiteur de Promicine".
Alana en a reçu, et Shawn.
Tout le monde en a eu.
A chaque fois qu'ils sont venus au centre
médical du NTAC. Dans chaque check-up.
C'est nous qui avons fait ça, Tom.
On les a rendus malades.

Pendant ces 60 derničres années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées
Elles ont été renvoyées
toutes ensemble
Sans aucun souvenir
de l'endroit oů elles étaient
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un seul jour
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des pouvoirs
Toutes tentent de se reconnecter...
... avec leur vie passée
Nous ne sommes pas la menace,
nous sommes le remčde.
Le monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans les 4400
Ils ont arręté un suspect pour
le meurtre de Jordan Collier.
Roy Mardsen n'a pas tué Jordan Collier.
Et toi non plus, Kyle.
Fils de pute !
Vas-t'en, et dis ŕ ton pčre
qu'il n'a tué personne.
Si Maia a des visions,
tu devrais ętre au courant,
et tu devrais savoir ce qu'elles sont.
Les patrons de maman seront punis
pour nous avoir trahi.
Je veux retourner ŕ la maison.
Je sais que c'est ce
que tu veux, chérie,
mais le Dr. Hudson va
trčs bien s'occuper de toi.
Ne dis ŕ personne que
je ne peux plus guérir.
Bien sűr.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Ce que j'ai ŕ faire.
Si vous ętes malade, la chose
ŕ faire est de le signaler au NTAC.
Mais si vous allez bien...
entrer en quarantaine est facile,
mais en sortir... cela pourrait
se révéler bien plus dur.
Il y a une substance synthétique
dans le sang de tous les 4400,
Ils lui ont męme donné un nom.
Ils appellent ça...
"inhibiteur de promicine".
A chaque fois qu'ils sont venus au centre
médical du NTAC. A chaque check-up.
Votre fille est la pierre de Rosette pour
comprendre ce qui est arrivé aux 4400.
Nous sommes ses parents,
c'est nous qui décidons.
Tu es sűre de vouloir faire ça ?
Emmčne-nous juste, Isabelle
et moi, dans un endroit sűr.
Mais si le choix se présente
entre la sécurité du peuple Américain
et le bien-ętre des 4400, Tom...
ce n'est męme pas un choix.
Nous avons essayé
d'ętre raisonnables.
Dans 10 heures, nous
commencerons ŕ aller les chercher.
Tranquille McCullough.
Laissez moi partir ! Je ne suis pas malade !
Tout va bien chez moi !
On le sait, mais vous ętes un 4400
et tout le monde doit y aller.
Allez.
Je ne veux pas vous menotter.
mais si vous fuyez encore,
vous ne me donnerez pas le choix
"Quarantaine" n'est qu'un mot
pour vous les gars.
Essayez de le vivre.
Allez.
Qu'est-ce qu'on est en train
de faire Diana ? C'est mal.
Ok, qu'est-ce que tu suggčres ?
On arrive au NTAC,
et on crie "c'est nous. C'est nous
qui les avons rendu malade."
Oui, oui, c'est un bon début.
On a les dossiers médicaux.
On peut les montrer ŕ Dennis.
Tu crois vraiment que Max Hudson
et quelques médecins isolés
ont tramé un plan secret pour
empoisonner les 4400 ? Je veux dire,
tu penses vraiment
qu'ils l'ont fait sans approbation ?
Approbation de qui ?
Dennis Ryland premičrement.
Il était ŕ la tęte de la division
quand tout ça a commencé.
Je veux dire, tu crois
qu'il ne savait pas ?
Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'on sache jusqu'oů
ça remonte, on doit rester calme,
travailler calmement...
et surveiller nos arričres.
Ne me dis pas de me calmer, Lily.
Comment je suis censé ętre calme
alors que ma femme et ma fille
sont parties au milieu de la nuit ?
On ne t'a pas quitté, Richard.
Je sentais qu'Isabelle
n'était pas en sécurité lŕ bas.
Tu as fait de cette résistance ŕ la
quarantaine une affaire personnelle.
Le NTAC en a fait mon affaire personnelle
quand ils ont commencé ŕ nous ramasser.
J'admire ce que tu fais,
mais ce n'est pas mon combat,
et je ne le laisserais pas
devenir celui d'Isabelle.
Dis moi juste oů vous ętes.
Rassure moi. Je viendrais vous voir.
Lily ?
Je suis désolée. Je pense simplement
que c'est mieux comme ça pour le moment.
J'appellerai bientôt.
Ca ne s'est pas passé aussi bien
que maman l'espérait.
- Urgences, décrivez la nature...
- Non...
J'ai besoin d'une ambulance.
Je suis... Je suis malade.
J'ai ce...
Allo ?
Allo ?
Mademoiselle, vous ętes lŕ ?
Laissez tomber.
Tu crois qu'ils s'échangent
des tuyaux boursiers ?
Soit ça, soit elle lui reprend son bureau.
- Aprčs toi.
- Merci.
Nina.
Content de vous voir.
Merci. J'aimerais que les circonstances
soient un peu meilleures.
On a perdu les premiers
4400 durant la nuit.
7 morts.
Il y en aura plus
avant la fin de la journée.
Aucune nouvelle
sur un vaccin, un remčde ?
Je viens de raccrocher avec Hudson.
Il a dit qu'ils ont travaillé
sur quelques trucs durant la nuit.
Je vais ŕ la quarantaine.
Diana...
Je sais que c'est frustrant,
mais  on a les meilleurs cerveaux
de ce pays, de ce monde, sur le coup.
Ils feraient bien de travailler rapidement.
7 personnes sont mortes.
Alana  pourrait ętre
la prochaine, ou Maia
et personne n'a une idée d'oů
ça peut venir, n'est-ce pas ?
On  le découvrira.
Hey chérie.
C'est moi Tom.
Qui ętes vous ?
Qui ętes vous ?
Elle était réveillée tout ŕ l'heure.
Seulement quelques minutes.
A- t-elle dit quelque chose ?
Elle a parlé de vous.
Elle a dit que vous alliez tout régler.
J'espčre qu'elle dit vrai.
Moi aussi.
Allons y.
Oů est-ce qu'on va ?
On a un rendez-vous avec
ce cher docteur Hudson.
Diana, qu'est-ce...
qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
On doit parler de
certaines choses, Max.
On pourrait bientôt avoir
ce qu'ils ont nous aussi.
Ce gars que nos agents
ont ramené, Orson Bailey,
je pense pouvoir expliquer
comment il a développé ça...
mon dieu, je ne peux
męme pas dire ce mot.
Télékinésie.
Merci.
Le corps comporte
4 neurotransmetteurs principaux.
Ce sont les flics de la
circulation du cerveau.
Ils contrôlent tout, régulent tout.
Dites moi quelque chose
que je ne sais pas.
Bailey présente un 5čme
neurotransmetteur.
On n’a jamais vu ça avant.
Personne.
Je suppose que ça détermine
les capacités de Bailey
ŕ pouvoir plier des petites
cuillčres avec son esprit.
Disons que la promicine est
pratiquement un laissez-passer
pour la section VIP du cerveau.
Il utilise des parties du cervelet
auquel aucun humain
n'a jamais eu accčs.
J'ai fait des tests sur les 4400
qui sont encore en quarantaine.
Chacun d'entre eux produit
des petites quantités de promicine.
Donc ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant
que chaque 4400 ne développe la télékinésie ?
On ne peut pas prévoir
le comportement de la promicine.
Ils n'auront peut ętre pas la télékinésie,
mais ils ont auront quelque chose.
Mettez ça par écrit.
Je veux que mon speech soit clair avant
d'essayer d'expliquer ça ŕ Washington.
Washington a paniqué.
On m'a ordonné de
travailler sur un médicament
pour supprimer la production
de promicine chez les 4400.
Une fois l'inhibiteur synthétisé,
on l'a donné ŕ chacun d'entre eux,
chaque fois qu'il venait faire un check-up.
Mais ça ne marche pas. Les 4400
développent des capacités tout le temps.
Seulement un petit pourcentage,
mais sans l'inhibiteur,
ils en auraient tous.
Je sais qu'il n'a pas
marché parfaitement.
"Parfaitement" ?
7 des 4400 sont morts
la nuit derničre.
C'est ŕ cause de votre inhibiteur.
Vous les avez rendu malade !
Vous croyez que je ne suis pas au courant ?
On n'essayait pas de tuer quelqu’un.
On préservait le statu quo,
faire ce qu'il fallait.
Je crois que ça a raté.
J'essaie d'inverser les choses,
mais si vous voulez appuyer sur la détente,
s'il vous plait, ne vous gęnez pas.
Peut-ętre qu'enfin je pourrais dormir.
Trčs bien.
Si vous ne me descendez pas,
laissez moi retourner
ŕ mon travail.
Je veux que personne
d'autre ne meure.
Alison ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Ils vont proposer perpétuité ŕ Roy.
Ils vont lui proposer perpétuité,
et il va accepter.
De quoi tu parles ?
L'Etat voulait
la peine de mort, mais
l'avocat a convaincu Roy
d'accepter un marché.
Mais ils n'ont pas de dossier
contre lui. Mon pčre me l'a dit.
Je ne sais pas. L'avocat, il gčre,
genre, 10 dossiers différents,
et il ne veut pas aller au tribunal.
Je ne sais pas.
Mais il ne l'a pas fait, ok ?
Il n'a pas tué Jordan Collier.
Tu n'arrętes pas de dire ça. Est-ce que
ton pčre sait quelque chose ? Quoi ?
Il y a des preuves
que tu me caches ?
Quoi ? Tu dois me dire.
Si Roy accepte le deal, il ne pourra męme
pas ętre libéré sur parole avant 20 ans.
Il ne va pas en prison.
Pourquoi ?
Les 4400 sont revenus le 14 aoűt.
Hudson a découvert
la promicine le 11 octobre.
Ils ont probablement donné les premičres
doses d'inhibiteur environ ŕ la fin du mois.
Mais on a tous les documents internes
d'octobre. Il n'y a rien sur ça.
Il n'y a męme pas
une mention d'Orson Bailey.
On a tous les deux écrits des rapports
sur lui, Diana. Ils ont disparu.
Ils espéraient que ce serait la seule capacité
surhumaine développée chez un 4400
Si ils détruisent tous les dossiers...
personne ne saurait.
Mais c'est remonté en haut
de la chaîne alimentaire.
Ici. Grande Bretagne, France, Corée...
partout il y a des 4400 malades.
Il doit y avoir une trace écrite.
Est-ce important ?
On pourrait trouver un mémo signé par tout
le conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies.
Ca ne guérira personne.
Diana, on a fourni des dossiers médicaux
confidentiels au Dr. Burkhoff.
On a le soi disant
"pčre de la technologie 4400"
qui travaille sur ce dossier,
et tu viens de coller ton flingue
sur la tęte du directeur médical du NTAC.
On a fait tout ce qu'on pouvait pour que les
personnes adéquates bossent sur un remčde.
Si le NTAC veut un remčde.
Ryland a parlé aux gens de Washington, qui
sont sur le pied de guerre depuis des mois.
Ce n'est rien qu'un coup
de chance pour eux.
Tu penses qu'ils
les veulent tous morts ?
Je vous l’avais dit ! Je vous l’avais dit
que je n'étais pas en sécurité ici.
Ce n'est qu'une précaution, Kevin.
On pense que vous serez plus en sécurité si
vous déménagez dans un endroit moins exposé.
C'est parce que je vous ai dit pour
l'inhibiteur, n'est-ce pas ?
J'ai passé 6 ans dans
un hôpital psychiatrique
ŕ souffrir de troubles
paranoďaques de la personnalité.
Dčs que je serai sorti, vous me mettrez
en plein milieu d'une énorme conspiration.
Le Dr. Burkhoff a inventé toutes
sortes d'histoires sur le NTAC.
Des choses trčs intéressantes.
Il peut inventer toutes les théories
qu'il veut, mais pas ici.
Je m'assurerai qu'il a un
endroit sűr pour travailler.
J'ai découvert ce qu'est la promicine.
C'est le nom qu'ils donnent ŕ
ce neurotransmetteur, exact ?
Celui qui donne leurs
capacités aux 4400 ?
Et si je peux trouver un 4400 qui
n'a pas été exposé ŕ l'inhibiteur,
je pense pouvoir le neutraliser.
Hey.
Tu m'as fait peur.
Pourquoi n'as tu pas utilisé ta clé ?
Oh, désolé. J'avais les mains pleines.
Je vous ai amené
quelques provisions.
Tu aimes toujours
les cerises au chocolat ?
Ca a l'air super. Merci.
Oh...
Tu...
Tu vas bien ?
Oui, un peu nerveuse.
C'est tellement calme ici.
Oui, beaucoup d'endroits
ont fermé pour la saison.
Oh, j'ai pensé que, euh...
je pourrais peut-ętre rester pour un
petit dîner ou quelque chose comme ça.
Tu ne dois pas rentrer ?
Oh, pas vraiment.
Carol est partie.
Elle a découvert
que toi et moi parlions.
Ne t'inquičtes pas, elle ne sait pas
que tu es ici, mais elle s'est fâchée.
Brian, je suis désolée.
Elle dormira ailleurs
pendant quelques nuits.
Je dormirais sur le canapé
pendant un moment...
mais pendant ce temps,
Heidi est chez une amie, et je me
suis dit, pourquoi manger seul ?
Bien  sűr,
mais j'espčre que tu ne
t'attends pas ŕ des grands trucs.
Je n'ai pas fait de
rôti depuis longtemps.
Tu sais, Lily, la vérité, c'est que...
je n'aurais jamais dű me marier
avec Carol pour commencer.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, Brian ?
Allez. Je suis seul.
Tu es seule.
Avec Richard,
vous n'ętes pas heureux.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Ca pourrait ętre comme avant, Lily.
- Brian, ne fais pas ça.
- Pourquoi tu résistes ?
Brian, arręte ! Lâche moi !
- Je ne veux pas te faire du mal, Lily !
- Arręte !
Petite salope.
Allo ?
Lily ?
Tu vas bien ?
Brian ?
Oui, j'allais amener ŕ manger.
Ne fais pas ça.
Quelque chose ne va pas ici.
Je n'ai pas eu de nouvelles
de l’abri de Wheeling depuis hier.
On doit supposer
qu'il a été découvert.
C'est le 3čme ŕ devenir silencieux.
Ils nous attrapent un par un.
On doit envisager de se défendre.
On peut faire ça, Richard.
On a certainement des 4400
qui peuvent faire des dégâts,
mais une fois qu'on a franchi cette limite,
on ne peut plus revenir en arričre.
Excusez moi, mais ne devrait-il pas y avoir
des barreaux sur ces fenętres ?
Le but est d'ętre discret,
Dr. Burkhoff.
Bien,
ça me semble ętre un peu négligeant.
La plupart d'entre vous sont
des 4400. Je suis un collabo.
Vous savez ce qu'ils font
aux collabos ?
On doit le mettre au travail.
Ca le calme considérablement.
On a vidé une pičce pour vous.
Si vous avez besoin de quoi
que ce soit, faites nous savoir.
Ce dont j'ai besoin, c'est un 4400 propre,
un qui n'a pas été exposé ŕ l'inhibiteur.
Je suppose que vous
n'en avez pas, n'est-ce pas ?
A vrai dire, peut-ętre.
En 20 ans, je ne vous ai jamais vu vous
servir ŕ boire au frais du gouvernement.
Je n'ai jamais supervisé la rafle
de citoyens innocents avant.
Votre conscience
vous titille, Dennis ?
Putain, oui.
en effet...
et étant donné les circonstances,
je dirais que c'est un bon signe,
mais  j'essaie de me concentrer
sur mon travail, Tom...
et j'ai besoin que
tu fasses de męme.
Mais parfois, quand vous...
vous cherchez une chose, vous...
vous apprenez autre chose.
Vous savez comment c'est, Dennis.
Je sais exactement
ce que vous voulez dire.
J'ai appris des choses
par moi męme.
Ouvrez lŕ.
Le savoir est un fardeau, hein, Tom ?
Est-ce que vous croyez que
j'allais le libérer de quarantaine
sans garder un oeil sur lui ?
Pourquoi n'avez vous pas
arręté tout ça ?
Parce que je ne savais pas
exactement ce que Kyle allait faire.
J'ai en quelque sorte laissé
le futur jouer son jeu.
N'est-ce pas ce dont vous
parlez tout le temps ?
Vous avez piégé Roy Mardsen.
C'était mon cadeau
pour vous, Tom.
Est-ce que vous préféreriez que
j'envoie ça ŕ mes patrons ?
Je préférerais que vous soyez l'ami...
que vous soyez le Ryland avec
qui j'ai travaillé pendant 20 ans.
Je n'ai pas changé.
J'ai un rude travail,
et je fais de mon mieux,
et en tant que patron,
et en tant qu'ami,
j'attends que vous m'aidiez.
Kyle détestait la quarantaine.
Je me demande
ce qu'il pense de la prison.
Ils savent.
Le NTAC sait que
tu as descendu Collier.
Quoi ? Comment ?
Ils savent tout depuis le début.
Ils ont laissé ça se produire.
J'ai besoin que tu te
prépares ŕ partir d'ici.
Je vais appeler les amis d'Alana.
Tu m'envoies en Espagne ?
Si ils viennent te chercher, j'ai besoin
que tu sois pręt ŕ partir sur le champ.
As tu entendu que Roy Mardsen va
ętre envoyé en prison ŕ vie ?
Ils l'ont piégé.
Mais si je fuis...
une seule chose ŕ la fois, Kyle.
Laisse moi m'inquiéter pour toi,
puis je me chargerai de Mardsen.
Alors tu veux que je
commence ŕ faire mes valises ?
Oui, Kyle ! Tu n'entends pas
ce que je te dis ?
J'avoue le meurtre de Jordan Collier.
Il s'est suicidé ?
Je savais que Max avait
beaucoup de pression mais...
il avait les vies de tous ces gens
entre ces mains. Celle de Maia...
je sais,
mais le Dr. Pinero est l'adjoint
d'Hudson depuis le tout début.
Il sait tout ce qu'Hudson savait.
On  va quand męme
vaincre cette chose.
- Bonjour Tom.
- Nina.
Tiens.
J'ai attrapé ça dans
ta boite ŕ lettres.
Tu es au courant pour Hudson ?
Oui. Tu vas bien ?
Ils disent que c'est un suicide.
Qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?
Tom, regarde ça.
C'est de la part de Max.
"Mémo Firewall".
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Je ne sais pas.
Pourquoi tu fais ça, Isabelle ?
Maman doit savoir.
Je t'ai amené ici pour qu'on soit en
sécurité. N'est-ce pas ce que tu veux ?
Lily, qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
Tu vas bien ?
Non. Vas-t'en !
Je t'ai dit de ne pas venir ici !
C'est pour ça que je suis lŕ.
Lily, je t'en prie, laisse-moi entrer.
Comment je peux ętre sűre
que tu es réel ?
De quoi est-ce que tu parles ?
Bien sur que je suis réel.
Est-ce que Carol t’a quitté ?
Pourquoi est-ce
qu'elle me quitterait ?
Lily, je vais entrer, d'accord ?
Non. Non !
Non !
Lily... whow, whow, whow, whow.
Lily...
Pose le couteau. S'il te plait.
Je suis juste venu vérifier
que tout allait bien.
Regarde, c'est moi.
Brian.
Pose ce couteau.
Lily, on va tous mourir.
C'est ce que tu veux ?
Non !
Arręte, Isabelle !
Non !
Lily, j'ai entendu crier.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Brian... Si tu es réel,
il faut que tu me sortes d'ici.
Isabelle ne veut pas ętre ici.
Firewall... C'est un logiciel de sécurité.
C'est grâce ŕ ça qu'on empęche les virus
de s'installer sur le disque dur.
Ok, est-ce que tu as déjŕ vu un mémo
avec le mot "firewall" en sujet ?
Non, mais de toutes façons je ne lis
presque jamais les mémos qui circulent ici.
Combien de temps est-ce que
vous allez bosser ici, les gars ?
Ils repeignent vos bureaux ou quoi ?
On avait besoin d'intimité, ok ?
Tom, quoi que contienne ce mémo, je doute
qu'il ait été distribué ŕ tout le monde
et toute copie a du ętre
détruite il y a des mois.
Donc s'il n'y a pas de copie,
et si Marco est la seule personne
en qui on doit avoir confiance
pour parler de ça,
alors c'est une voie sans issue.
On pourrait toujours débouler dans le bureau
de Ryland et le questionner ŕ ce sujet.
Ce mec adore les mémos.
Quand il travaillait ici, j'ai du en jeter
quelque chose comme 15 par jour.
Plutôt 20. Il aimait
faire fumer son clavier.
Qui ça, Ryland ?
Oui.
Il ne les tapait pas. Il m'appelait
parfois quand il plantait son pc.
Le roi de la frappe ŕ 1 doigt.
Ca lui prenait 10 minutes
pour taper une adresse mail.
Ryland dictait tout ŕ sa secrétaire.
Elle avait un accčs de sécurité niveau "L".
Regarde.
"D. R. /J. O."
"D. R. /J. O." est marqué partout.
D. R. pour Dennis Ryland.
Et J. O. pour Jane Orman. Elle a
travaillé pour lui pendant 22 ans.
Elle est restée ŕ Seattle ?
Passez-lui le bonjour pour moi.
Lily.
Tu es revenue.
Tu vas bien ?
Je pensais faire pour le mieux,
mais Isabelle...
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Elle voulait ętre avec toi,
et cet endroit... Je ne sais pas.
Hé.
Papa t'a manqué ?
Oui ? Eh bien
tu lui as manqué aussi.
Toutes les deux.
Ecoute, je vais...
Je vais m'en aller.
Brian...
Merci... pour tout.
Hé...
Fais-moi une faveur.
oublie cette adresse,
oublie-nous tous.
et j'oublierai que tu as conduit ma femme
hors d'ici au milieu de la nuit.
Bonne chance, Lil.
Je t'ai appelé toute la journée.
Il y a un homme ici qui pense qu'Isabelle...
Excusez-moi. Est-ce que personne
n'a entendu cette voiture arriver...
C'est elle ?
Je pense qu'il y a quelqu'un ici
qui veut faire ta connaissance.
Voici Isabelle.
Qu'est-ce qu'on est censés dire ?
"Vous savez, cette
énorme conspiration destinée ŕ
supprimer les pouvoirs des 4400 ?"
"On espérait un peu que vous nous
rencardiez sur les détails."
Oui et "ne soyez pas inquičte, on a du semer
un agent du gouvernement pour venir ici."
Oui, c'est un bon début.
Hmmm.
Tom Baldwin.
Ca fait un bail, Jane.
Tu te souviens de ma coéquipičre,
Diana Skouris ?
- Bien sur.
- Oui. Bonjour.
Je me suis toujours
demandée qui viendrait.
J'aurais dű deviner
que ce serait vous deux.
Vous ętes lŕ pour "firewall",
n'est-ce pas ?
Venez.
L'inhibiteur n'a pas été testé.
Il n'est pas pręt.
Un des 4400 est un tueur en série
qui utilise, je ne sais pas moi,
un genre de contrôle mental pour obliger
les gens ŕ commettre des meurtres.
L'inhibiteur est pręt.
Ce n'est pas bien, Dennis.
On est au-delŕ du bien et du mal, lŕ !
Il n'y a pas de précédent ŕ cette situation.
Maintenant Washington
a été informé de l'opération.
Elle a été approuvée au plus haut niveau.
Il n'y a plus rien ŕ discuter, si ?
Je ne ferai pas ça.
Je l'ai ramené
ŕ la maison cette nuit lŕ.
Le lendemain,
je donnais ma démission.
Vous devez comprendre
que pendant 2 décennies,
j'ai pensé que Dennis Ryland était le
meilleur homme que je n’ai jamais connu,
et aprčs avoir lu ça, je ne
pouvais plus travailler pour lui.
Je n'arrętais pas de me dire de l'envoyer
quelque part... ŕ des journaux, ou...
je ne sais pas...
mais les noms qui ont signé ça...
j'étais une simple secrétaire.
Qu'est-ce que j'aurais
pu faire contre ces noms ?
Tout est lŕ.
Tu as vu les noms ?
Quand Maia a dit "les patrons de maman
seront punis pour nous avoir trahis",
je n'avais aucune idée qu'elle voulait
parler de toute la chaîne de commandement.
On ne peut pas encore
rendre ça publique.
Quoi ?
On en peut rendre ça
publique tout de suite.
Ecoute, plus vite on révčle ça,
mieux ce sera pour Maia,
Alana, Shawn... tout le monde.
Plus de secrets.
On ne peut plus compter sur les gens
qui ont fait ça pour trouver un remčde.
Ils vont au moins devoir annuler
l'ordre de quarantaine.
Diana, Ryland a
quelque chose contre moi.
Ryland ?
Tout ce mémo comporte sa signature.
Qu'est-ce qu'il peut bien avoir contre toi ?
Il sait que Kyle a tué
Jordan Collier.
Quoi ?
Cette nuit lŕ ŕ Highland Beach,
ils ont mis quelqu'un en lui,
ou un programme... je ne sais pas,
qui contrôle ses actes,
et Ryland a une preuve.
Je suis désolée, Tom,
mais je ne peux pas cacher ça.
L'état de Maia empire !
Donne-moi seulement une heure,
Diana. Juste une heure.
S'il te plait.
Arręte de dire ça.
Tout ne va pas bien, Kyle.
Si je vais plus loin avec ça,
ils vont te rechercher,
et peu importe si tu es
en Espagne ou en Sibérie.
Je sais, mais avec toutes ces vies
en jeux, tu dois le faire.
Ok, je t'emmčne ŕ l'aéroport.
Papa...
je n'irai nulle part.
Ca rend les choses plus faciles, en fait.
Je ne savais pas comment te le dire.
Me dire quoi ?
Je ne peux plus vivre comme ça.
Je ne peux pas vivre en sachant
que ce gars est en prison.
Je résiste chaque jour en prétendant que
tout est normal, mais c'est une mascarade.
Je ne peux pas te laisser
faire ça, Kyle.
Marsden m'a tiré dessus.
Il a aussi tiré sur d'autres flics.
Męme si tu avoues, Kyle,
il ira en prison.
Si tu essayes d'enterrer des
choses comme ça, ça te change.
Regarde l'effet que
ça a eu sur ton patron.
Ryland était ton ami.
C'est fini, papa. Plus de mensonges.
Je ne peux plus faire ça. Je n'en peux plus.
Ok ? Tu ne m'en empęcheras pas.
Ok ?
Ne t’avise pas de faire quoi que
ce soit avant que je sois rentré.
Tu m'entends ?
C'est la chose ŕ faire,
le comportement héroďque,
et devenir un héros
apporte des avantages.
Vous me dites ce que je veux savoir,
Je verrai pour vous faire transférer dans un
centre de quarantaine privé cet aprčs-midi.
Vous pourrez faire des promenades,
choisir vos repas...
qu'est-ce qu'il y a de mal ŕ ça ?
139 rue Lebanon.
C'est lŕ qu'ils m'ont dit d'aller.
L'inhibiteur est transporté
par le glucose.
Ca pénčtre dans le cerveau
grâce ŕ une diffusion facilitée.
C'est une protéine qui se fixe.
C'est comme ça qu'ils ont fait...
Je vous crois sur parole.
Mais ce sérum
contient de la promicine pure.
Ca peut neutraliser la charge.
L'inhibiteur ne sera plus capable
de traverser les membranes.
On peut le faire sortir
de leur cerveau.
Une fois que c'est parti,
la maladie disparaît ?
S'il vous plait.
Arrętez de l'appeler "maladie."
Pour la derničre fois,
c'est un effet secondaire.
Otez l'inhibiteur, le systčme
immunitaire fonctionnera.
Ca se produira pratiquement
instantanément.
Donc
cette substance...
Promicine.
C'est ce qui vous rend unique.
Comment vous l'avez
extraite de ma fille ?
Elle en a
quelques traces
dans son flux sanguin.
Avant que vous ayez l'inhibiteur,
vous en aviez tous.
C'est comme ça qu'ils l'ont
découvert la premičre fois...
mais...
c'est une enfant.
Je n'ai pu extraire assez de sang…
que pour faire une dose.
Si vous arrivez ŕ faire
entrer ça en quarantaine,
une dose devrait
pouvoir vous suffire.
Nina, oů est Ryland ?
Un 4400 a divulgué la location
de l’abri de Seattle.
Ils sont en route
pour le prendre d'assaut.
Excusez-moi.
Ne tirez pas.
Dr Burkhoff, pourquoi est-ce
qu'on vous tirerait dessus ?
Aucune idée, mais je ne me sens pas
trčs en sécurité lŕ maintenant.
J'ai apporté
quelque chose pour vous.
Quoi que vous fassiez,
ne la lâchez pas.
Tout le monde dans cette maison est sujet ŕ
la quarantaine et est en état d'arrestation.
d'aprčs l'ordre d'urgence 74.
Vous avez 5 minutes
pour sortir dans le calme.
Sinon, nous entrerons et
viendrons vous chercher.
Oh...
Il y a toute une armée dehors.
Ryland !
Arrętez ça.
C'est fini.
La quarantaine. Tout ça.
L'agent Baldwin fait obstruction
ŕ la justice. Arrętez-le.
Je ne crois pas, Dennis.
Je suis au courant pour Firewall.
Gardez-le en joue.
Vous voulez vraiment
abandonner votre fils ?
Kyle va se rendre lui-męme.
Il ne peut pas vivre
dans ce mensonge.
Quand j'ai écrit ce mémo,
nous n'avions aucune idée de
l'endroit d'oů venaient les 4400,
ou pourquoi
ils avaient été renvoyés.
Dr Hudson m'a donné l'information.
J'ai agit en fonction, Tom.
Si vous aviez été ŕ ma place,
vous auriez fait la męme chose.
Salut.
J'ai un médicament pour toi.
Pour ętre honnęte avec toi,
je préférerais donner ça ŕ Maia,
mais un neuroscientifique cinglé m'a dit que
ce n'était pas la bonne chose ŕ faire, alors
si ça ne t'embęte pas
de tenir encore une minute...
Vous avez rencontré
Orson Bailey en personne.
Oliver Knox.
Vous saviez de quoi
étaient capable ces gens.
Et bordel j'ai joint vos rapports au mémo
quand je l'ai envoyé ŕ Washington.
Mais nous avons appris
mieux, Dennis.
Highland beach ?
"Sauver le futur" ?
Quel message sincčre, Tom,
et pendant qu'ils vous le donnaient,
ils programmaient votre fils
pour qu'il commette un meurtre.
Est-ce que d'aprčs vous ils avaient l'air
de nous emmener vers le paradis ?
Je ne sais pas, mais
je suis sűr d'une chose,
c'est que je ne veux pas vous
suivre lŕ oů vous m'emmenez.
Bon sang, Tom !
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire,
d'abord, "sauver le futur" ?
Sauver le futur comment ?
En nous tuant tous ? En redémarrant avec
une population moindre et plus évoluée ?
Est-ce que c'est une solution
avec laquelle vous pouvez vivre ?
Avec quoi pouvez-vous vivre, Dennis ?
La mort de Max Hudson était-elle un suicide
ou avez vous encore tiré les ficelles ?
Et pour moi Dennis ?
Parce si vous vous accrochez ŕ l'espoir
de garder tout ça sous silence,
tu vas devoir me descendre
ici et maintenant.
Tom, tu réduis le destin de la plančte
ŕ une question de foi personnelle.
Sans le programme d'inhibition,
qui sait ce qui se passera ?
Qui peut savoir ?
Trčs prudent.
Simpliste.
Mais si le monde devient un espace pour
des 4400 aux capacités non contrôlées,
j'espčre qu'on ne le regrettera pas.
Baissez vos armes.
On en a fini ici.
Vous pouvez tous retourner chez vous.
- Thomas.
- Alana.
Alana.
Thomas...
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ici ?
Un miracle.
Bon retour, bébé.
La maison...
Je n'ai jamais pu
défaire mes cartons.
On va s'occuper de ça tout de suite.
Oů est Kyle ?
Je suis impatiente de le voir.
Oui, je lui ai dit que tu revenais ŕ
la maison. Hey, Kyle ! On est de retour.
Hey, Kyle.
Mec, je n’aurais jamais cru
que je te reverrais.
Tu vas bien, n'est-ce pas ?
Je me sens comme si j'avais vidé
15 fűts de bičre hier soir,
mais oui, ŕ peu prčs.
On va tous bien.
Le Dr. Burkhoff a pris des échantillons
de sang des personnes que j'ai guéri.
Chaque échantillon a guéri
quelqu'un d'autre, donc...
Vous avez eu du pot, hein ?
Du pot ? 23 d'entre nous sont morts,
et ils n'ont pas encore fini de compter.
Je ne pense pas que ça faisait
partie du plan, tu sais ?
Ce n'est pas pourquoi
ils nous ont ramené.
Toute cette idée de plan...
Je ne sais pas.
J'aimerais pouvoir croire ça.
Crois moi simplement quand
je te dis qu'il y a un plan,
qu'il est important, et que
chaque 4400 en fait partie.
Shawn...
J'ai tué Jordan Collier.
Quoi ?
J'ai acheté une carabine,
je suis monté sur ce toit,
j'ai descendu 2 agents du gouvernement
et puis je l'ai abattu.
Tu te souviens quand
j'avais des problčmes ?
Que j'avais des pertes de conscience ?
C'est ce que je faisais.
Je planifiais un assassinat.
Pourquoi ?
Tu crois que je le sais ? Il y a quelque
chose ŕ l'intérieur de moi, Shawn...
ou quelqu'un.
Il prend le dessus.
Ces gens qui vous ont pris ?
Si ils ont un plan,
ça m'inclue en tant que
meurtrier de Jordan Collier.
Ce n'est pas vrai, Kyle !
Alors pourquoi ils m'ont fait faire ça ?
Pourquoi ils ont ruiné ma vie ?
Je suis sur le point d'aller en prison
pour les gens que tu vénčres.
Tu as assassiné Jordan ?
Je ne voulais pas...
Je ne savais męme pas ce que
je faisais, Shawn. Je suis désolé.
Je suis tellement désolé.
Kyle...
Arręte... Shawn...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ? Arręte ça.
Tu es en train de me tuer.
Shawn...
Je te libčre.
Libčre...
Tiens le coup. Ca marche.
Je vais le faire sortir de toi.
Tiens le coup.
Tiens le coup, Kyle. Ca marche.
Tu n'avais vraiment pas
ŕ faire ça, tu sais.
En fait...
je pense vraiment
que je devais le faire.
Ah.
Quoi ?
Eh bien,
tu es censé dire,
"je voulais le faire".
Oh, oh...
Oui.
Ne pousse pas ta chance.
Whoa.
Euh,
on dirait qu'ils parlent de poursuivre
ces personnes pour meurtre.
Ryland. Toute l'équipe.
On dirait que maman va avoir
un paquet de nouveaux patrons.
Et bien, j'espčre qu'ils vont ętre
enfermés pour trčs longtemps.
Je serai au premier rang au procčs.
Je suppose que je devrai
acheter un costume.
Je vais m'asseoir ŕ coté de toi
jusqu'ŕ ce que tout ça soit fini.
Rien n'est fini.
Ca ne fait que commencer.
Ma puce, de quoi tu parles ?
Qu'est-ce qui commence ?
La guerre.
Kyle...
Je suis pręt.
Es-tu sűr ?
Oui.
Je viens avec vous.
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Isabelle ?
Isabelle ?
Bonjour, Shawn.
Je suis Isabelle.

Merci aux Fantastic4400 pour cette saison
previously on the 4400...
a comet cannot change course.
this one has.
then it's not a comet.
we're not sure what's just happened.
there appears to be something out there.
the light is gone,
and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared.
diana skouris. tom baldwin.
you two will be one of the teams
that's responsible for investigating
what happened to the returnees?
-we're letting them go. -we're letting them go?
we don't have a legal right to hold them.
why disappear a little girl from the 1940s,
hold her for 60 years,
and then send her back with the ability
to predict the future?
can i go home?
home? with you.
i don't like being here alone.
shawn farrell...
uncle tommy. hi.
he's all yours.
hey, what about kyle?
kyle's in a coma, shawn.
what the hell did you do to kyle?
i don't know what happened.
i put my hands on him.   that's it.
he woke up.
you're talking about   some kind of ripple effect.
diana skouris    to the head of the class.
the incidents themselves are just catalysts for change.
i swear to god.
i'll ask you one more time...
where's my son?
-kyle! kyle! -no! tom, don㦙!
you're not my son.
who are you? what are you?
i'm human.  i come from a different time.
your future.
in my time, humanity is dying out.
only those we took can prevent the catastrophe from happening.
that's why they've been altered
and seeded back into the timeline.
you mean it's all going to end?
you have to help them.
help them? how?
dad?
kyle...
i intend to provide a safe haven
for any 4400 in this country who needs one.
you goddamn freak!
danny, stop it!  stop blaming me  for nikki!
i guess what i'm asking is if i could stay here for awhile.
tell me a little more about this...ability of yours.
i wasn't pregnant  when i was abducted,
but i was when i got back.
that baby could be the key to the future,
and it has to be protected,and i can do that.
go ahead! run!
i will find you.
that baby belongs with me.
isabelle...
isabelle...
what is it,baby?
bad dream?
same one.
she's fine,richard.
we're all fine.
come back to bed.
it's probably just a raccoon--
who was it?
they took off  before i could ask.
they left something behind.
someone tracked us down.
who?
ntac?
collier?
this look like their calling card to you?
i don't know who it is,
but someone knows we're 4400s.
start packing.
i'll drive into town    tomorrow morning
to pick up my last paycheck,
and then we're out of here.
can't we just go now?
we're gonna need that money,lily.
mr. and mrs. sumlin.
peter.
if you'll follow me.
forgive our appearance.
as you know,
the center doesn't officially  open until tomorrow.
peter doesn't have time to wait.
that's where you're wrong,mrs. sumlin.
peter has   all the time in the world.
hi,peter.
my name is jordan collier.
just this way.
our medical lab isn't quite ready,
so we thought peter would be more comfortable up here.
hello,peter.
i'm shawn.
what do you say we get started?
yeah?
okay,buddy.
i want you to take my hands.
try and relax.
okay?
you're okay.
you're doing good.  you're doing so good.
it's okay.
oh,my god.
is he okay?  he's fine.
just watch.
it's okay.
you're okay. you're okay.
peter?
how do you feel,honey?
son?
thank you for your   generous donation.
we tried everything.
radiation,bone marrow transplants...
is he really cured?
take him back   to his doctor.
run some tests.
peter's leukemia is gone.
this is a miracle.
for now,it has to remain   a private miracle.
may i remind you that the confidentiality agreement
you've signed is strictly binding.
but people should know  about that young man.
and they will.
in time,they'll know everything.
very nice.
floating the five.   floating the five.
you nervous?
aren't you?
no,not at all.
well,maybe a little bit.
okay. a lot.
now,you really want to do this,right?
right.
let's go.    okay.
says here    she registered an ability
under the dinstman-lenhoff bill.
some kind    of precognitive insight?
yes,her visions stopped about four months ago.
we're not sure why.
oh,too bad.
i was going to ask if teledex will hit its quarterly projection.
well,we'd like to get started,if that's all right.
certainly.
if you'll just sign  where indicated.
diana skouris,
your adoption of maia rutledge is hereby complete,
legal,and binding.
so witnessed by me,henry biederman,
10th circuit family court of seattle.
you know,some of us have to look far and wide
to find the people  we'll call "family."
you two had to look   clear across time.
diana,let me introduce you to your daughter maia.
maia,say hello  to mommy.
i'm not doing it.
i mean it this time. no way.
it's just    a cat scan,kyle.
you've had them before.
this one's gonna tell them the same thing
the last 150 told them--nothing.
there's nobody in here but me.
i know that,
and sooner or later,
they're going to stop looking.
when? when?
i wish i knew,
but with ntac,the government,
they've got bigger issues  than you or me,okay?
just--
kyle,they're still  trying to make sense
about what happened that night   at highland beach.
that's all.
they're afraid   if they let me out
i'm gonna spill the beans about their big secret?
well,they can relax,
because i just want to get out of you and be normal again,
and normal people don't go around
sounding off   about future humans
and the end of the world.
besides,i don't even remember what happened.
i know.
you listening?
<i>i don't remember!</i>
<i>just calm down.</i>  <i>just calm down.</i>
<i>dad,get me</i>  <i>out of here.</i>
talk to someone. anyone.
please,'cause--
shh. okay,okay.
okay. okay.
tom.
been awhile,huh?
yeah,you know how it is.
us desk jockeys don't have much cause
to mingle with you hot-shot field agents.
someone feeling a little sorry for himself today?
"the path to oblivion  starts here."
the 4400 were sent back to save humanity,
and i'm supposed to help them.
i was there on the beach,remember?
they gave me a mission,
and what's my biggest accomplishment of the week?
i convinced my son to take another cat scan.
somehow,i don't think that's what they had in mind.
diana,you ready to roll?
in a minute.
it's just we have to check in on three more returnees.
i want to make sure we get our reports in by 5:00.
okay,why don't you keep the car warmed up?
and i'll be right there.
you bet.
vic hubbard's the best lead investigator you could find?
oh,no,he's the fourth one this year.
two more,i break a record.
we've got to get you out from behind that desk.
i'm lucky to have a job here.
i put a gun to another agent's head,remember?
yeah,well,
i never said it was going to be easy.
it's obvious what really happened.
are you going to start in with your negative energy again?
white holes.    see,they're the answer.
that's how they took them,
and that's how they brought them back.
yeah,but white holes--  the second law of--
yeah,because i'm right.
switch it up.    switch it up.
guys! what's it like to not be right?
am i interrupting?
brady's back on his "white hole" kick again.
well,one day you'll explain to me the difference
between the white ones and the black ones,right?
well,how about tonight?
how about you just give me  that thing that we discussed?
can't.
why not?
i already sent it upstairs.
i wonder    if anyone's read it yet.
when they do,i'm sure you'll hear about it.
i owe you one,handsome.
h.p. lovecraft's
<i>the mountains of madness.</i>
are you trying  to tell me something?
which orderly did you steal it from?
matt?
arlo?
you're so sweet.
you're the only  person here
who doesn't    want me dead.
i wish i could take you with me when i go,
but i can't.
they only want me.
but i'll be    leaving soon.
very soon.
joanne? paul?
what are you doing?
sex maniac.
don't go flashing    those bedroom eyes at me.
joanne,i'm serious.
put that stuff down before you hurt yourself.
we're building something.
i can see that.
can you really?
it's gonna be gigantic.
humongous.
rival the pyramids.
but some things are better left to the imagination,joanne.
besides,
you two   have physical therapy now.
let's go.
building something...
building nothing.
help me get rid of this junk.
i'm sorry. too hard?
oh,no. hey,go ahead.
give it your best shot.
whatever you do,
you must be pretty good at it.
uh,yeah,i work with my hands.
same as you.
my apartment doesn't look   anything like this.
well,it helps to have friends in high places.
i'm always open to making new friends.
come in.
speak of the devil.
give us a moment.
has anyone ever told you your timing sucks?
if they did,i probably fired them.
for you.
it's in bookstores   tomorrow.
jordan,this is gonna sell,like,a million copies.
people are gonna freak out  when they read this.
big ideas make a loud noise when they land,shawn.
you wanted to see me,nina?
are you sleeping    with tom baldwin?
should i come back in?
maybe we could start over--
answer the question.
never even held hands.
do you owe him money?
okay,what game  are we playing here?
because if i knew the rules--
i am playing   the theory room paper game.
i don't know that one.
well,let me give you a hint.
"the necessity for the immediate reassignment
of thomas baldwin to active field duty."
catchy title.
did you come up with it    yourself,
or did the big brains    in the basement pitch in?
let's just say that i agree with the sentiment.
tom is the best agent i've ever worked with,
maybe the best  you've got in this division.
in the three months that baldwin was investigating the 4400,
this department learned more,far more,
than it has in the entire year   he's been shuffling paper.
he threatened  another agent's life.
he was trying   to protect his son,
who these future people,whoever they are,
chose as their spokesman.
that's not to mention that his nephew shawn is one of the 4400.
all of which sound like major conflicts of interest to me.
that's not  what dennis ryland believed.
dennis ryland  is no longer in charge here.
maybe you should call washington    and talk to him.
i don't have to call washington.
they've got me on speed dial.
congressmen,senators,
committee chairs,subcommittee chairs,
all of them looking   to this department,to me,
for answers.
which is why you can't keep an agent
like tom baldwin on the shelf.
he's a major player  in this case.
he's maybe the major player.
see,funny,that's exactly what it says in this paper.
maybe marco had me check it   for typos.
uh,the next time that you want  to send me a message,
put your own name on it.
mr. walcott!
get down from there!
arlo!
mr. walcott,get down from there!
arlo!
you heard the man!
mr. walcott,
get down from there this instant!
i'm calling security if you don't come down right now.
arlo!
this is your last chance.
what the hell are you    doing up there?
i got it.
arlo!
arlo,this is your last warning.
arlo,please!
be careful!
i'm coming down.
arlo,be careful!
watch what    you're doing.
i got it.
i got it.
oh,oh--oh,my god.
oh,my god!
no!
lily,i'm home.
lily,relax.
we don't   have to leave.
some nut papered the entire town   with these things.
he wasn't singling us out.
well,i still think  we should go.
i was scared  last night too,
but did you read this?
it's a rant,not a witch hunt.
maybe,but richard,
we still don't feel safe here    anymore.
you mean   isabelle doesn't feel safe.
richard,we've gone over this a dozen times.
i don't know why she talks to me and not to you.
"talks?"
communicates.
whatever.
did she happen to mention    where we should go?
does she have a place   picked out,
or will she know it    when she sees it?
we can find the town.
we already did.  right here.
isabelle is six months old.
i know she's   a special kid,
but we're still  her parents.
we make decisions for her.
she doesn't make them for us.
i know.
it's time we get out of here.
you're right.
you're absolutely right.
we're staying put.
maia?
party time.
macaroni and cheese,mashed potatoes,
and white bread.
everything i like.
the only things you'll eat.
you've got to promise me
that you'll    outgrow this phase soon.
mommy,how do you make this taste so good?
well,it's a hidden talent,i guess.
you just called me "mommy."
you're my mom now,right?
now and forever.
i like that.
me too.
so do you think  i'll ever go back to school?
weren't you just telling me you got,
like,a 97   on your math test?
not home-school.
real school,
with a playground,and recess.
well,sure you will...
you know,when you get  a bit older.
how much older?
i'm not seeing things that are going to happen anymore,
so it should be okay for me to be around other kids.
i think i'd be happy at school.
aren't you happy now?
i'm glad you're my mom for real,
but i could still use a...
like,friend or two.
more mac and cheese,please.
just a little.
sign this.
what is it?
your letter of resignation.
i thought i was being reassigned to field duty.
you are,effective immediately.
i need results.
we have a high-priced collection of sheepskin in the basement
that tells me you're the best way to get them,
so i'm willing to take a risk,
but i need  some insurance.
this.
i left the date blank.
you cross the line,i fill it in.
fair enough.
good.
here,look at this.
tess doerner.
diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the age of 15.
disappeared from abendson psychiatric hospital in april of 1955.
let me guess,they sent her back without bothering to cure her.
curing people was not part of their agenda.
we just got a call from the c.a.  over at the hospital.
one of their orderlies is dead.
he claims that there's    some kind of connection.
so...
we'll check it out.
hold on.
there's still one piece of business we need to get straight.
you're setting conditions?
this is your new house?
it's yours too.
well,all your stuff is here.  i...
kind of looks like  our old place,huh?
well,i tried,anyway.
only one thing missing.
mom.
yeah,i know.
sometimes i can't believe she's not here,either,
but we tried,kyle.
you know,we really tried to make it work.
i wish you both would have tried    a little harder.
i'm sorry. it's just...
you know,when something terrible happens to a family,
like when you were in the hospital,it can...
bring people closer together,
or drive them apart.
your mom and me...
i'll have to call her,
let her know i'm out of quarantine.
yeah,you should do that.
you know,it'd make her really happy.
shawn's gonna freak out too.
what?you know i'm gonna go see him,right?
you're a good cousin.
just don't expect too much.
you know,people change in four years.
i can't believe  you're standing here.
i've been looking forward to this moment for too long.
hey,you remember how we used to love to go to the batting cages?
you never could hit that curve ball.
me?no,it was you,
and i got plenty of quarters saved up,so...
maybe we should stop off    at the driving range too.
you want to learn    how to play golf?
i used to beg to teach you.
lot of things i want to try now,dad.
you make a list.
you want it,and we'll do it.
anything.
you can show me  tonight,okay?
you're leaving? i just got here.
it's my job,buddy.
now,get started on that list.
you people take your arts and crafts seriously,don't you?
you're sure tess drew this  before they started building?
she made her first sketch two weeks ago.
that thing started going up yesterday.
and you think that the orderly who died
is connected  to all of this?
arlo was on the ledge of "b" building,
prying loose a weather vane.
i believe it was this weather vane.
so why don't you just confine all the other patients to their rooms?
well,i've been tempted,
but this kind of cooperative behavior,
it's unheard of with these illnesses.
besides,i wanted you to get a look at that thing
before we tore it down again.
it's all right,kevin.
they're just here    to talk to tess.
he's very   protective of her.
she's his only friend in here.
really,it's okay.
i'll just let her know you're coming.
great.
we saw some of the pictures you did,tess.
they're really good.
they'll hear you.
there's microphones  in the walls.
they broadcast by satellite   to the submarines.
who does?
the doctors.
the doctors  here in the hospital?
some of them  are in the hospital.
some of them are stationed    on the submarine.
all right,we'll just talk really softly.
they took my crayons away,but they're too late.
yeah? why's that?
because it's gonna get built anyway.
they want me to  get in touch with them.
that's why they put the plans in my head.
uh,now,are we talking about the doctors here in the hospital
or the doctors under the sea?
neither.
we're talking about the people  who took me,stupid.
so the people who took you...
they want the patients here  to build that tower?
they'll do anything to get me back.
they like me.
did you ask the other patients for help,tess?
i don't like talking to them.
they're crazy.
was arlo crazy?
i never thought he was...
but maybe crazy is catching.
so my first day back,and what's going on?
nothing much.
just a bunch   of mental patients
building a machine   to contact the future.
well,that's what tess thinks,anyway.
she also thinks there are doctors
stationed under the pacific ocean,
listening to a radio broadcast
of her private conversations.
could be some kind  of collective hysteria.
doesn't explain   this guy arlo,though.
he's a middle-aged hospital orderly whose wife just left him.
it could have been suicide.
lost his nerve  at the last minute,
tried to grab    the weather vane.
i wonder how long it is since marco got some sun,you know?
i was thinking we could bring him down to have a look
at that thing they're building.
a road trip for marco?
he goes outside,tom,
but,you know,we could    have some sunblock handy.
it would be something,though,huh?
if she could actually do it.
contact the future.
tess is right.
maybe crazy is catching.
he was dictating a letter.
i don't know what happened.
he just grabbed his head and started screaming.
wait outside. now.
hold still. hold still.
thanks.
thank you.
they're getting worse.
jordan...
they're coming more often too.
you okay?
i'm fine.
i don't get it.
i don't get why these attacks    keep coming back.
i've cured...
emphysema,leukemia...
broken bones...
that baby really kicked your ass.
well,you just remember that when we find richard and lily.
you u und pretty confident,jordan,
but it's been a year.
sometimes i forget they're still out there.
i never forget,
and neither do the men i'm paying to find them.
okay,but if i were you,
i wouldn't want to be in the same time zone
as that kid.
if you two meet up again,it might just finish you off.
i have my reasons.
now,get some rest,okay?
all right.
big day tomorrow.
<i>in breaking news,</i>
<i>a revelation</i>  <i>about the origins of the 4400.</i>
<i>in his newly published</i>  <i>autobiography,</i>
<i>former real estate mogul</i>  <i>jordan collier</i>
<i>claims that the 4400</i>  <i>were abducted</i>
<i>by human beings</i>     <i>from the future.</i>
<i>the book contains copies</i>
<i>of classified</i>   <i>government memoranda</i>
<i>that collier says</i>    <i>prove his claims.</i>
<i>the documents</i>     <i>are said to come</i>
<i>from an anonymous source</i>
<i>within the national</i>   <i>threat assessment command.</i>
<i>according to collier,</i>
<i>the 4400 were returned</i>  <i>to avert a catastrophe</i>
<i>that threatens</i>     <i>the survival of mankind.</i>
why didn't you tell me?
<i>collier charges</i>
<i>that the government has</i>  <i>had this information</i>
<i>for more than a year,</i>
<i>but has kept it secret</i>
<i>in an effort to avert</i>    <i>a public panic.</i>
<i>the government claims</i>
<i>that the documents</i>  <i>are purely speculative</i>
<i>and have been quoted</i>  <i>out of context.</i>
don't care   who took them.
don't care who sent them back.
the government should have   kept them behind bars.
didn't you hear what the man said?
they're here to save the world.
what do you expect him to say?    he's one of them.
you're awful quiet.
i deal in facts...
and the fact is,
i've got to flesh the ... before lunch.
you'll be happy to hear that mr. collier's anonymous source
is anonymous no more.
agent hubbard will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
so,what about collier?
guy bought national secrets  on the black market.
i'm sure we'd all like to see collier charged with treason,
but it's unlikely.
i doubt we'll be able  to trace the payments directly to him.
now,as for this so-called "4400 center,"
round-the-clock surveillance  is in effect
until further notice.
i want pictures of everyone
who comes within a hundred yards of that place.
is it true that collier's filing for tax-exempt status?
apparently.
he's turning the 4400 into some kind of religion?
more like a cult.
well,"cult"is what the big congregation calls the little congregation.
cult,religion,whatever.
what's he basing it on?
have you read this thing?
collier claims that he can unlock the 4400 within anybody.
so he expects a guy punching a clock in pittsburgh
to believe he has some kind of latent superpower?
most of the 4400
don't even have    those kinds of abilities.
not yet,anyway.
no,but if you thought there was a chance
that you had an ability    locked away inside you...
you sound like you're ready to sign up.
no,
but i wouldn't blame anyone for being curious.
we keep telling the public that biologically,
the 4400 aren't any different  than the rest of us.
they haven't been altered  genetically,neurologically--
as far as we can tell,
but if collier thinks people are just going to sign their lives
and their life savings over to some metaphysical pyramid scheme,then...
he's in for    a rude awakening.
welcome to the center.
my name's devon.
what's yours?
kyle.
nice to meet you,kyle.
can i sign you up for a tour?
uh,thanks.
i'm just looking for my cousin.
shawn farrell?
i'm sorry.
mr. farrell's    not available right now.
could you tell him kyle's looking for him?
he does live here,right?
i'm afraid policy prohibits me from discussing our membership.
i'm not looking    for a discussion.
i just want to say hi to my cousin.
if you'd leave your name--
i'm not leaving anything.
what is the problem here?
there's no problem.
then tell shawn i'm here!
if he doesn't want to see me,fine,
but that's up to him,right?
would you lower your voice,please?
look,i've got nothing against you.
personally,
i hope the pod people return your body to you someday.
if it's all the same,i'll find shawn myself.
this way,sir.
get your hands off me!
you have    to leave.
you guys didn't tell me this thing was so big.
it wasn't.
not yesterday.
and those don't look like patients to me.
they're not.
dr. clayton.
i know what you're going to say.  we're falling behind.
we'll make up the time   this afternoon.
so is the entire hospital working on this thing?
it's the only way to get it done.
excuse me.
uh,randy,winston,we need a little help here.
dr. cho's back there with the satellite dish.
okay.
so first the patients,now the staff.
if this is some kind of mass hysteria,
it's spreading.
who does daddy love?
mommy...
and isabelle.
yes,he does.
you know what he sees  when he looks at you?
a beautiful baby. yes,he does.
but mommy sees  much more than that,
and you know why?
because you communicate   with mommy.
but you never talk to daddy.
so how about it?
anything you want to say    to daddy?
huh?
because i'm listening.
okay,then.
guess i'm left to muddle along   all alone.
richard.
we got to get  a copy of that book.
i want to read it.
you and me both,but i checked in town.
they won't have any copies till tomorrow.
i don't know about you,
but i kind of got used   to the idea
we'd never know  where she came from.
well,if we went to the future,
at least we came back    with a souvenir.
the people who took us,
they made all this happen,right?
they saw to it  that we got isabelle.
they must have   something in mind for her.
i have something in mind  for her too--
a normal life.
sounds good,
but we left normal behind    a long time ago.
this is outrageous!
we have work to finish here. important work.
the doctors want to work.
tell them to make their rounds.
no one's stopping them from taking care of their patients.
but the courtyard and the tower   are off-limits,you got it?
got it.
man,look at the size of that thing.
wouldn't mind having one of those  in my backyard,huh?
road trip's over. wait in the car.
so yesterday,
a few patients were compelled to work on this thing,
and today it's the entire hospital.
if we get tess out of here,
do you think   this compulsion will fade?
i don't know.
it's worth a try,isn't it?
all right,i got you.
it's okay.
i'm not a bad person.
i'm not.
no,no,no one's saying you are,tess.
then why are you going to    stick wires in my brain?
i promise,tess.
no one's   going to hurt you.
that's what everyone says,right before they hurt you.
why am i being punished?
i'm a good person. really.
i'm only doing what they want.
guys! guys! get over here!
kevin!
kevin...
okay,tess. let's go. come on.
come on.
it's all right.    kevin...
do you have a seven?
go fish.
i am   so sorry i'm late.
who do we have here?
this is carrie. she lives downstairs.
the u.p.s. man left their package with us by mistake,
and when her mom came to get it,carrie was with her,
and now i'm invited to her birthday party,
and it's a sleep-over.
i can go,right?
hi,carrie.
i'm diana.
it's nice to meet you.
nice to meet you.
i already said it's okay.
well,i think we should probably   talk to carrie's mom first,
don't you?
oh,look,you know what?  it sounds fine to me.
thank you,thank you,thank you,thank you.
you never told me    i was a prisoner.
have you ever seen a prison cell,shawn?
it looks nothing like your apartment.
goddammit,jordan,since when do you decide
who i see and talk to?
this is about your cousin,isn't it?
so you did know  he was here.
i know he was rude and aggressive,
and had to be escorted from the premises.
you mean thrown out.
it might have been handled more smoothly,shawn,
but all in all,
i'd have to say it was for the best.
kyle is my friend.
he was your friend.
look,a year ago,
you came to me looking for a new life,
your old one in shambles.
kyle,friend or not,
is part of that old life.
so what do you   want me to do?
you just want me to cut him loose and forget he exists?
he's no different    than your mother,
your brother,or your friend nikki.
don't you-- they do not understand
what it is we're trying to accomplish here.
you know,maybe i don't either.
well,then,i suggest    you pack your bags and...
leave.
so,what happens next time you start screaming out in pain?
do what's right for you,shawn.
i'll take care of myself.
i just got the full medical workup on tess.
let me guess--
physically normal across the board.
you can say this for the 4400--
they're consistent.
tess draws a picture of a...
a tower,or a monument...
yeah,or a beacon...
and the people around her drop everything and start building it.
well,they can't help themselves.
they have to work.
it's like ants.
come here.
the queen secretes a chemical,
tells the other ants what to do.
the drones don't stop working until the job is done.
doesn't matter if one of them dies,
or if a storm comes  and washes away the anthill.
they just keep working...
unless you take the queen away.
let's hope our drones respond the same way.
right,so the future sent back    a schizophrenic queen ant
with a blueprint for what,some interstellar walkie-talkie?
let's see what tess can tell us.
we'd just better not get too close,
because if your  theory's right,
anyone who gets exposed to her  could be vulnerable.
all right,i'll talk to tess.
you check in with garrity    at the hospital.
these friends of yours,
the ones who took you,
what do you think they want to talk about?
they're so much smarter than you,
it isn't even funny.
yeah,well...
yeah,i don't doubt it.
i mean,they figured out how to take you
and how to send you back.
sending me back was a mistake,and they know it.
i'm supposed to be there.
where exactly is "there?"
there were doctors there too.
they were nice. all of them.
they were nice.
you remember  where you were taken?
we slept a lot,but not all the time.
we wore gray clothes.
there was a giant building.
the doctors wore shiny jackets.
i miss it so much.
go on.
i really like hearing you talk about it.
our rooms had round windows.
high doorways with arches in them.
the stones had writing in them.
math symbols or something,
inscriptions,
jars of purplish metals,
and rods with stained tips.
these symbols,tess,what did they look like?
tess?
tess,do you remember   what the inscriptions said?
they're waiting to hear from me.
i need to get in touch   with them.
tess. tess.  just wait--
tess,just wait.
garrity,why haven't you been   picking up your cellphone?
<i>i'm sorry.</i>
<i>it's been kind of crazy</i>  <i>down here.</i>
so is everything all right?
<i>yeah. fine.</i>
<i>we're just about</i>  <i>done here.</i>
done?
well,the satellite dishes are a bitch to hook up,
but we'll get 'em.
come on,people.
let's get those dishes secured.
we don't have all day.
i just had the most unbelievable conversation with tess.
well,it couldn't    have been any more unbelievable
than the one i just had  with garrity.
can't say   i see it that way.
no other way to see it.
that book is blasphemy.
well,don't buy it  if that's how you feel.
"the third angel blew his trumpet,
"and a great star fell from heaven,
burning like a torch."
revelations 8:10.
i'll take your word  for it.
the day they came back
was the beginning    of the end times.
sounds like you've done  a little more thinking on it than i have.
either remove the book from the store,
or my boy here will remove it for you.
like hell he will!
do you know what  you're carrying there,woman?
it's just a book.
it's the doorway to hell.
that child yours?
that's my daughter.
abomination begets abomination.
richard!
what's going on?
we've got to get out of here.
now.
these new guys you sent us  are no good.
park told me he had experience with a welding torch.
experience at what? starting fires?
now our schedule's in the toilet.
did either of you call the fire department?
time to go.
hurry,richard.
hurry!
as of tonight,abendson state hospital
is officially    under quarantine.
the patients will remain locked down.
hospital staff and affected ntac personnel
will be confined to the site
until we've isolated  the source of the compulsion.
that sounds like a good plan,
but who's going to watch over them?
the last group we sent was compromised within hours.
which is,quite frankly,
a little disturbing,
if you think of this like an epidemic...
in the cdc,
we'd call tess   "the sole disease vector."
you remove her,you remove the urge to build,
except as far as we know--
none of those agents   had any contact with tess.
so it's like the flu,
or any other  airborne virus.
you catch it,you can pass it on.
what is this thing supposed to be,anyway?
my guess,
and i cannot emphasize the word "guess"strongly enough,
is that tess is telling us the truth.
it's some kind of communication device.
to contact who?
the future?
the only way to find out
is to let the patients   finish building it.
that night on highland beach,
they were trying  to tell us something.
the conversation was cut short.
which is why we've been stumbling around in the dark this last year.
tess is the only 4400
who remembers  where she was taken--
no,claims to remember  where she was taken.
she's also the only paranoid schizophrenic,
and it sounds to me like you two
have been spending a little too much time around her.
well,maybe i caught    the bug too,
but,uh...
i agree with them.
the quarantine orders at the hospital remain in effect
until further notice.
the guards will rotate shifts to minimize their exposure.
so where does that leave us?
until we're sure the compulsion's not spreading anymore,
you two aren't going  anywhere near that facility.
isabelle's asleep.
rainy day came sooner than expected.
do you think we lost them?
i'm not ready to stop    for pie just yet.
i got 1,200 here.
another 300    in my pocket.
i'm carrying two.
we're going to have to get those back windows replaced in the morning.
this should be enough to carry us through  to montana.
what did eric say when you called?
he was a little  surprised to hear from me,
but even back   in quarantine,
he used to say how us 4400s should stick together.
yeah,we didn't have much choice back then,
though,did we?
the bank will  wire us our savings when we get there.
if things get really bad,we can sell these.
i put that ring on you forever.
guess you and isabelle   were right.
we should have taken off when we had the chance.
it's gonna be a long night.
you want me to drive a shift?
get some sleep.
maia,what's wrong?
i'm sorry.
i know it's late,
but maia really wanted to come home.
why is that,sweetie?
i don't want to talk about it.
some of the girls,not my daughter,
but some of the other girls,
were teasing maia.
i guess she said she has a crush on frank sinatra.
well,ol' blue eyes.    do you blame her?
most nine-year-olds don't even know who frank sinatra was.
i want to go to bed.
i guess it got   pretty nasty.
i feel terrible.
maybe maia can come back  another time?
just her and carrie.
yeah. we'll talk about it.
thank you.
good night.
good night.
maia.
i know you didn't fall asleep   that fast.
it was awful.
you were right.
well,i didn't want to be right.
i don't need any friends.
everyone needs friends,maia.
come on,i really think   we should talk about this.
well,i don't.
buck's burgers.
good as i remembered.
kind of a strange thing to have on top of your list,
but hey,you know what?
i'm glad i could make   your dreams come true.
kyle,shouldn't you  be in bed?
dad,i'm 21.
so i have to keep    reminding myself.
i'm making some popcorn. you want some?
you're kidding me.
you could eat more?
i've been eating quarantine food for a year.
you guys might be keeping the country safe,
but your cafeteria sucks.
hello?
hello?
kyle.
we got to get the baby out of the cold.
i don't think there's any motels on this road.
i was thinking we'd head south,catch the 35.
guy should lose his high beams.
that's the first car we've seen in,what,like,15 miles?
get your head down.
ah... oh,my god,richard.
it's them.
hold on! hold on!
everybody okay?
yeah,i think so.
okay. let's go.
spread out.
hey,maia,sweetie.
it's wake-up time.
okay.
huh?
it was a late night,huh?
all right. 15 more minutes.
you know what?
frank sinatra is the coolest,
and don't you let anyone ever tell your dear friend.
so you didn't read any of it?
no.
i wouldn't want my daughter reading my diary.
you keep a diary? am i in it?
oh,come on,don't flatter yourself.
so,really,you don't even know
if "what she sees" means...
things during the day,
tv shows,ponies,whatnot...
or it could be "what she sees,"
a week,a month,a year down the line.
she hasn't had  one of those visions in,like,four months.
well,that's what she tells you,anyway.
why would she lie?
she wants to be normal,right?
every time she makes a prediction,
someone calls her a freak.
look,i understand.
you're her mom now.
there are certain protocols.
next time i'm over,why don't i take a peek?
you think that'd be  any less of a betrayal?
respecting maia's privacy   is no small thing,
but you've got to weigh that against the information
that could be in that diary.
you know what?
when you stop   trusting a parent,
it's really hard to start again,
and yes,i'm speaking    from experience.
hey.
i'm glad it's not my decision,
but if maia's having visions,you should know about it,
and you should know what they are.
is it bad?
i just jammed it    when we spun out.
just need to walk it off a little more.
we'll follow this stream south.
hike through the water a bit,
throw 'em off our trail.
it'll be cold.
it'll keep us awake.
after a mile,we'll...
we'll double back west.
head straight for the highway.
sounds easy when you say it.
we can do it.
we're going to do it,right?
keep her quiet.
she's going to bring them right to us.
does the name "gene pecusa"  ring a bell?
yeah,returnee 927.
oh,let me guess.
he still has the ability
to turn 20 bucks into a crushing hangover.
and a night in  the drunk tank.
we've got to ferry him   back to his halfway house.
give it to mortimer and falcone.
we got something else    on our plates?
everything's quiet   at abendson.
no one's been allowed    near the tower.
that's the problem,isn't it?
tom... tom,no.
you do remember
that jarvis has still got   your letter of resignation.
she wants results.
i'm going to give them to her.
and besides,you want to know
what that thing is as badly as i do.
i'm trying not to    think about it.
yeah,well,i can't think of anything else.
so it sounds like tess    has got her hooks in you.
i don't have the urge to pick up a tool belt.
i'm coming with you.
it's all right,tess.
we're taking you back to abendson.
we signed you out,tess.
no one from ntac is coming after you.
not you people. the doctors in the submarines.
they're watching us.
what,you're having second thoughts?
no,just get in.
so you still owe me four or five dollars
for those   two six-packs?
something like that?
i've got a 20 right here,
if you think you can take it from me.
look at you,man.
back among the living.   you look great.
i walk. i talk.
i seem to have full control of my limbs.
you still hit    like a girl.
nothing's changed.
four years? plenty's changed.
what are you talking about?
we saw each other right when  you got out of the hospital.
i don't remember any of that.
you don't?
so you don't remember sitting naked in the sprinklers?
no.
sounds like something you'd do.
well...
thank you.
i never got a chance to say that.
for getting me out of the coma...thank you.
you know,if it  hadn't been for me,
you wouldn't have been  in that stupid hospital
anyway,so...
no,i'd have been the one who disappeared into 4400 boot camp.
maybe i'd have come back with the magic hands.
all right,all right.    okay.
speaking of disappearing,you jerk...
oh,kyle,don't go there yet.    come on.
don't go there?
your mom   is so freaked out.
you haven't seen her in a year.
you haven't seen anybody.
your brother.
my dad.
what was going on  with you and nikki?
kyle,i don't want to talk about nikki.
we're all really worried about you,man.
you don't need to be.
i mean,i'm fine.
i've been to that place  where you're living.
there are some serious   <i>stepford wives</i> vibes
going on there,you know that,right?
all that stuff about "unlocking the 4400 inside everybody..."
yeah?
you don't really believe  collier can do that,do you?
kyle...
look around us,man.
the world is in a total freefall.
these centers,
they're a chance    to bring people together,
maybe our last chance.
i don't just believe that he can do it.
i believe that he has to do it.
sounds like someone  got inside your head.
he said you wouldn't understand.
collier?
i got to tell you,man,he was right.
richard!
god. what happened?
guess i wasn't looking   where i was going.
okay. we just need to rest.
you think they're stopping for breaks?
come on,richard.
five minutes.
all right,people,come on!
everyone out to the tower.
come on.
we've got a lot of work to do,and not a lot of time to do it,
so let's go,come on.
go,go.
come on,you heard me. let's go.
this one's mine.    stand over there.
hey,kevin!
look. i escaped.
always thinking of me.
kevin's a genius,you know,
but he doesn't brag about it.
i bet in a couple of days all these berries will be ripe.
don't eat them now.
the last thing we need    is to start cramping up.
look.
i thought you said   they weren't ripe.
they weren't.
well...
isabelle?
had to be.
way to go,little girl.
they're going to   have to work fast.
i'm going to help them.
that's not funny,diana.
i really want to do this.
no,you'd only be    in the way.
you don't understand.
i really need to do this.
have these sent to my house.
shawn,i've been looking for you.
yeah,i took a walk.
we have a special visitor    tonight.
she has pancreatic cancer.
her husband is willing   to donate real estate
for a 4400 center    in los angeles.
well,tonight doesn't really  work for me,jordan.
well,you have five...
no,six hours  to get in the mood.
mood's   got nothing to do with it.
i'm just not working tonight.
richard,please.
don't do this.
we don't have another choice.
there's three of them.
they're going to kill you.
not if i get my hands on one of those shotguns.
you can barely walk.
it's our only chance.
i've got to do it now,
while i still have the strength.
if i'm not back by sundown,
take the baby and walk due west.
it's that way.
just keep going in a straight line.
understand?
i'd give up another 50 years if it meant finding you again.
you knew about this,didn't you?
knew about what?
baldwin and skouris signed tess doerner out of here
and took her back to abendson.
they're rebuilding the tower.
that would be one theory.
no crying. you can't cry now.
drop it.
i'll cut you in half.
turn around.
i taught you boys    better than this.
get up!
diana,how's it going?
well,it turns out we're in better shape than i thought.
the fire missed  most of the wiring.
so how soon till it's ready to go?
well,we've got to finish    triangulating the dishes,
and then we're good.
just get it done.
baldwin.
we've got your man!
either you come out,
or the next sound you hear
is him being blown straight to hell!
i told you,she's miles away by--
open your mouth again,
i'll cut your tongue out.
watch him.
lily! run!
are you sure you don't want to say goodbye to me?
 ..
last time,bowen,unlock the door.
can't do that
you said you want results.
listen to me bob,when you are not in your right mind.
it's not the results that we was talking about.
you step awey before you get hurt.
take
no,no,just wait
we need a
just listen,listen to me
it's a risk,i know.
it's sometime you want to get the tureth
you have to take a ...
just listen to me.
you want the trueth?
tess sdores the memery...
they are not memeries.
she read the short...
step awey from that tower.
where are you?
where are you?
let's get everyone back in their rooms.
we need a full head count before the next round of medications.
where are you?
i did what you wanted,right?
talk to me.
come on,tess.
we all could use a little rest.
but they lied to me.
or did i lie to you?
well,somehow   i wanted more.
i don't know what i expected.
another ball of light,
a booming voice from the sky...something.
could we have built it wrong?
maybe.
all i know is that i don't feel like  picking up a hammer anymore,
and 10 minutes ago,
that was all i could think of.
i want to be updated as soon as there's    new information.
norad said the pulse dissipated before it left the atmosphere.
could be all this sound and fury   was for absolutely nothing.
now,our first priority is to help the hospital personnel
restore order here,okay?
and then i want all of you who were infected    with this thing
to be checked out    by ntac medical.
you including me in that order? because i'm not sure--
you were infected,
because if you're standing here telling me you weren't,
i'm putting a date on that letter of resignation.
i was definitely infected.
i thought so.
we could use a little help policing the area here,
and we need to get rid   of these tools
before  one of the patients hurts themselves.
you heard the man.
excuse me. dr. clayton?
kevin...
did you just speak to me?
i guess i did.
i haven't said anything    for a long time,have i?
try six years.
i can think again too.
i don't know   what happened,
but...
i feel...
better.
you had me followed?
i could have had your   conversation recorded.
i just thought    that might be pushing it.
god,kyle's right.
i am some kind of prisoner.
shawn,i've told you,
you can leave here   any time you want,
and i meant it,
but until you do,
i will not allow these shadows   from your past
to alter your perceptions
of what it is we're trying   to accomplish here.
you're too important.
no,no,you mean you need me
to help bring in the big checks.
shawn,the money...
is a means to an end.
the goal is what matters.
ensure the future.
save the planet.
i can't do that without you.
you want proof the future works   in mysterious ways?
look no further than mr. kevin burkhoff.
yeah,instead    of contacting the future,
we got him.
well,not as disappointing as it might seem at first blush.
burkhoff was a tenured professor of neurochemistry at stanford university.
neuroscience.
only class i ever got a "b" in.
yeah,you're not alone.
only a handful of people work at the top of the field at any given time.
our mr. burkhoff was the heir apparent,
until he suffered his first delusion at the age of 30,
and he was institutionalized two years later.
what was he working on?
you want a ripple effect?
how's this?
burkhoff specialized   in dormant neural pathways.
he was trying to wake up   parts of the brain
that we can't use.
parts that would do what?
well,parts that could lead to all kinds    of special new abilities,
like...precognition.
right,marco?
precognition,
telekinesis...
stop me if any of this sounds familiar.
maia rutledge.
orson bailey.
you're saying that burkhoff is the father of the 4400 technology?
it's possible.
and we just woke him up.
PREVIOUSLY ON THE 4400--
WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT'S JUST HAPPENED.
THE LIGHT IS GONE,AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
HAVE JUST SUDDENLY APPEARED.
-WE'RE LETTING THEM GO.
-WE'RE LETTING THEM GO?
YOU DON'T HAVE A LEGAL RIGHTTO HOLD THEM.
YOU'RE PREGNANT?
I WASN'T PREGNANT WHEN I WAS ABDUCTED,
BUT I WAS WHEN I GOT BACK.
WHAT'S ALL THIS?
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?
THAT BABY COULD BE THE KEY TO THE FUTURE,
AND IT HAS TO BE PROTECTED,AND I CAN DO THAT.
GO AHEAD. RUN!
THAT BABY BELONGS WITH ME.
THIS IS  YOUR NEW HOUSE?
IT'S YOURS TOO.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MOMENT FOR TOO LONG.
DIANA SKOURIS,
YOUR ADOPTION OF MAIA RUTLEDGE
IS HEREBY COMPLETE,LEGAL,AND BINDING.
HER VISIONS STOPPEDABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO.
WE'RE NOT SURE WHY.
MRS. USHER NEXT DOOR IS GETTING A KITTEN.
MOMMY'S BOSSES WILL BE PUNISHED FOR BETRAYING US.
IT WASN'T ME!
THAT CREATURE MADE ME    PULL THE TRIGGER!
GETTING DRESSED FROM THE TOP DOWN NOW?
THAT THE WAY THEY DO IT ON THE MARINERS?
MARINERS?
GARY'S GOT HIS EYES  ON THE SOX.
NO,YOU MEAN THE SOX GOT THEIR EYES ON HIM.
HOW'S IT FEEL,ALL THOSE SCOUTS IN THE STANDS?
YOU BEND OVER TO TIE A SHOELACE,THEY MAKE A NOTE.
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE RESPECT,HUH?
YOU'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE NEW JACKIE ROBINSON.
FIRST 4400 TO MAKE THE BIG LEAGUES.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SCOUTS,MAN.
I'LL FLOAT YOU SOME RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.
YOU JUST GET INTO YOUR RHYTHM,
FORGET THEY'RE EVEN OUT THERE,ALL RIGHT?
CAN'T BLAME HIM.
SIX SCOUTS.
I'D BE AFRAIDI WAS GOING TO CHOKE.
I'M NOT GONNA CHOKE.
BARNES CAN'T SERVE THEM  ANY BETTER THAN THAT.
JUST... JUST    GIVE ME A SECOND.
HE'S THROWING HIM A BEACH BALL.
HE'S SCARED,MAN.
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT?
WHAT A LOSER.
FOLLOW THROUGH.FOLLOW THROUGH.
THIS TIME TRY TAKING THE BAT OFF YOUR SHOULDER.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY KISSING MY ASS?
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,GARY?
NAVARRO!GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME. FOCUS.
I WANT TO SEE SOME CONTACT.

I'LL PLANT YOU WHERE YOU STAND.
I AM NOT GOING TO HIT YOU!
WHO SAID ANYTHING   ABOUT HITTING,MAN?
THAT'S IT,NAVARRO.    YOU'RE DONE FOR THE DAY.
I WANT TO SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE AFTER PRACTICE.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.
-KEEP WALKING,MISTER.
-THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME!
KEEP WALKING,MISTER. NOW.
GARY,MAN,TAKE IT EASY.

THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME!
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG    WITH ME!
WELL,IT BEATS THAT DITCH IN THE WOODS.
NOT BY MUCH.
IT'S JUST   A DAY OR TWO.
LET ISABELLE  GET RESTED UP,
THEN WE'LL PUSH ON    THE REST OF THE WAY.
WE GOT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT TO WHITE BIRD?
NEW CAR...
TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM...
IT'S GOING    TO BE CLOSE.
ALL THIS RUNNING AND HIDING,
SOMETIMES I FORGET WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.
THREE DEAD MEN IN THE WOODS MIGHT DISAGREE.
DO YOU WANT TO SHOWER FIRST,OR SHOULD I?
YOU GO AHEAD.
GIVE ISABELLE HER BOTTLE,OKAY?
THAT WAS YOU,WASN'T IT?
WHO STOPPED THOSE MEN    IN THE WOODS?
DADDY SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME,ARE YOU?
WHAT'S FUNNY?
MARMADUKE.
CAN WE GET A DOG?
OH,SMOOTH,HOW YOU SLID THAT IN THERE.
NO.
SKOURIS.
APRIL.
NO,NO,NO,NO.
I'M GLAD TO HEAR FROM YOU.    YOU'RE MY SISTER.
IT'S JUST... IT'S BEEN A WHILE,THAT'S ALL.
NO,WE'RE HERE,JUST HAVING BREAKFAST.
HANG ON A SEC.
MRS. LENNOX MUST'VE FORGOTTEN HER KEY.
I'LL GET IT.
NO,NO. NO,I'LL GET IT.  YOU JUST KEEP EATING.
I JUST HAVE TO LET MAIA'S TEACHER IN.
COMING!
ONE MORE SEC.
SURPRISED?
APRIL--
HOW'S IT GOING,SIBLING?
GOOD.
YOU LOOK GOOD.
YEAH,YOU TOO.
THANKS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST    BODY ART EXPO.
I HAVE A BOOTH.
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T    GOTTEN YOUR TICKETS YET.
UH,NO.
HELLO.
OH,MY GOD.
YOU MUST BE MAIA.
APRIL SKOURIS,BLACK SHEEP OF THE FAMILY.
DI,YOU ARE SO LUCKY.
LOOK AT THIS FABULOUS KID YOU GOT.
AND NO LABOR,NO STRETCH MARKS,NO DIAPERS...
NO CRAPPY HUSBAND.
OH,WAIT,THAT WAS ME.
HOW COME I NEVER MET YOU BEFORE?
-IT'S COMPLICATED. -WE'VE BEEN BUSY.
OKAY,WE'LL STICK WITH "BUSY."
WHATEVER.
I'M HERE NOW.
SO WHERE ARE YOU STAYING  WHILE YOU'RE IN TOWN?
THIS COUCH LOOKS COMFORTABLE.
IT'S NOT AN EXECUTION,SHAWN.
LAST TIME I WAS ON STAGE
WAS MY FOURTH-GRADE  SPELLING BEE.
THESE PEOPLE  ARE INTERESTED IN US.
THEY WANT TO HEAR  WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY.
YOU'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.
HELLO.
MY NAME IS SHAWN FARRELL,
AND I AM ONE OF THE 4400.
UH,A FEW MONTHS AGO,
I NEVER THOUGHT ANYONE WOULD EVER CLAP WHEN I SAID THAT.
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW THEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW--
THE FUTURE OF MANKIND IS IN JEOPARDY,
AND RIGHT HERE,WITH YOUR HELP,
IS WHERE WE START TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT.
IF YOU JOIN US HERE--
MR. COLLIER,MR. DRAVITT'S HERE FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
...THE BEST VERSION  OF YOURSELVES.
IAN.
THANKS FOR FITTING ME IN.
INTERESTING PLACE YOU GOT HERE.
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABDUCTED    BY ALIENS,AM I?
NO,IAN.  THEY WEREN'T ALIENS.
THEY WERE FROM THE--FUTURE
I KNOW.SO YOU'VE TOLD ME,AD NAUSEUM.
LOOK,IT'S ALL THE SAME SIDESHOW TO ME.
SO,HERE I AM.
HERE YOU ARE.
WHAT SAY    WE GET DOWN TO BUSINESS?
IAN DRAVITT.
FOUNDER AND CEO    OF EXECUTIVE PROJECTIONS,
A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION   BASED IN ZIMBABWE.
YOUR COMPANY WANTS TO DO
BUSINESS IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY,
THEY'LL SHOW YOU  THE LAY OF THE LAND.
IT'S ALL PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE--
YEAH,ON THE SURFACE,
BUT DRAVITT'S REAL MONEY COMES
FROM MERCENARY ACTIVITY  AND ARMS DEALING.
SOLD GRENADE LAUNCHERS   TO THE I.R.A.,
WHITE PHOSPHORUS LANDMINES TO
THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS IN PERU...
SO WHAT'S HE SELLING   TO COLLIER?
GOOD QUESTION,
BUT OUR OBSERVATION TEAMS CAN'T EVEN
 TELL YOU WHAT TIME COLLIER TAKES LUNCH.
BEYOND THE LOBBY,THAT PLACE IS A MYSTERY.
I MEAN,WE'VE SENT OUR AGENTS
IN DISGUISED AS AIR CONDITIONING GUYS,
FIBER OPTICS REPAIRMEN--
YEAH,WE GET A BUG IN,
IT'S YANKED BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER.
PROBABLY SWEEPING THE PLACE    EVERY FEW HOURS.
AS FAR AS COLLIER'S POW-WOWS WITH DRAVITT...
ALL WE CAN DO    IS GUESS.
YOU THINK    HE'S STOCKPILING WEAPONS?
OH,ARMS,ANTHRAX--
NOTHING WOULD SURPRISE ME.
I MEAN,COLLIER'S ALL BUT SAID
HE'S AT WAR WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
COULD BE LAYING DOWN
A DEFENSE PERIMETER AROUND THE CENTER.
THAT WAY,IF WE EVER HAVE TO GO IN THERE,HE'LL BE READY.
THINK WACO.
JONESTOWN.
JARVIS.
I'LL SEND THEM DOWN.
MR. NAVARRO?
I'M AGENT SKOURIS.   THIS IS AGENT--
PLEASE... PLEASE,DON'T TALK.
IT'S TOO NOISY.
YOUR VOICES AND YOUR THOUGHTS,THEY JUST ALL BLEED TOGETHER.
THE E.R. REPORT SAID YOU WERE GOING ON ABOUT--
NO VOICES.
JUST CONCENTRATE   ON WHAT YOU WANT TO ASK ME,
AND I'LL HEAR YOU.
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
IT WAS DURING A GAME.
I COULD HEAR EVERYONE'S THOUGHTS.
AT FIRST,IT WAS JUST THE PITCHER,WHICH WAS PRETTY GOOD,ACTUALLY...
BECAUSE I KNEW EVERYTHING  HE WAS GOING TO THROW BEFORE HE THREW IT.
WENT FIVE FOR FIVE.
TWO HOMERS,TWO SINGLES,AND A DOUBLE.
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT--
YEAH,IT WAS GREAT   WHEN IT STARTED,
BUT I CAN'T CONTROL IT.
FIRST,IT WAS    EVERYONE ON THE TEAM,
AND THEN EVERYONE IN THE STANDS,
AND THEN,I DON'T KNOW,IT WAS JUST...
JUST EVERYONE.
IT'S LIKE  THIS OCEAN OF NOISE CRASHING AROUND IN MY HEAD.
I WANT SOMEONE   TO MAKE IT GO AWAY.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
I WAS THIS CLOSE...
TO MAKING IT TO THE MAJORS  WHEN I GOT SNATCHED.
THIS TIME,I'M GONNA MAKE IT.
I HAVE TO MAKE IT.
WHAT,SO NAVARRO IS REALLY SOME KIND OF MIND READER?
I BELIEVE "TELEPATH" IS THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
WELL,CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE
 IF THE WORD MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE,
BUT THE GUY DEFINITELY KNEW WHAT WE WERE THINKING.
INTERESTING GIFT.
I COULD THINK OF A FEW PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS FOR IT.
DR. OSTMAN GAVE HIM SOME HALOPERIDOL.
IT CALMED HIM DOWN,QUIETED THE NOISE SOME.
SO HE CAN FUNCTION AS LONG AS HE'S ON  ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDS?
WE DON'T HAVE TO FIT HIM  FOR ANY STRAITJACKET,
BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HITTING ANY KNUCKLEBALLS EITHER,
WHICH IS ALL HE WANTS TO DO.
YEAH,I'LL PUT  NTAC MEDICAL ON IT.
IF THEY CAN HELP HIM,THEY WILL.
GREAT.
KYLE BALDWIN.
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?
THERE IT IS.
BALDWIN...
NOPE.
YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE TO REGISTER.
SURE I AM. I GOT IN LAST SEMESTER.
I JUST TOOK DEFERRED ADMISSION.
EXCEPT YOUR TUITION    HASN'T BEEN PAID.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
MY DAD SENT A CHECK.
NOPE.
BALDWIN.
GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
I'VE GOT NAVARRO'S   TRANSFER FORMS RIGHT HERE.
YOU SIGN THEM,HE'S ON HIS WAY TO NTAC MEDICAL.
YEAH,I WILL,BUT NOT JUST YET.
WHY NOT?
WELL,WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT COLLIER AND IAN DRAVITT ARE UP TO.
A 4400 WHO CAN READ MINDS JUST WALKED THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR.
YOU WANT TO USE NAVARRO  AS A MOLE?
IS THAT EVEN LEGAL?
MM-HMM. D.C. CLEARED IT.
WELL,HOW ABOUT ETHICAL?
GUY'S ASKING US FOR HELP.
HELL,HE'S EVEN BEGGING US.
AND WE'LL HELP HIM.
BUT HE'S GOT TO HELP US FIRST.
WHAT IF HE SAYS NO?
THEN YOU'LL GET HIM   TO SAY YES.
EXCUSE ME.
CAN WE GET ONE MORE BLANKET?
THE ONE WE HAVE    IS KIND OF THIN.
YEAH,WELL,THEY'RE ALL KIND OF THIN,
BUT IF YOU WANT    TO BRING IT DOWN,I'LL SWITCH YOU.
OH,I THINK WE MIGHT NEED BOTH.
YOU MIGHT THINK YOU NEED THEM,
BUT YOU AREN'T   GOING TO GET THEM.
SEE,THERE'S ONLY SO MANY ROOMS  AND SO MANY BLANKETS.
AND YOU HAVE YOUR ALLOTMENT.
MY BABY IS COLD.
CAN I PLEASE  HAVE ONE MORE BLANKET SO SHE DOESN'T GET SICK?
I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE DOLLARS.
I'M A SUCKER FOR A PRETTY FACE.
HE WASN'T VERY NICE TO US,WAS HE?
HERE.
THANK YOU
WHAT OF THAY CATCH ME?
WE'LL BE MONITORING YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
WE PLANT A TINY TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER
BEHIND YOUR EAR UNDER THE SKIN
TAKES 10 MINUTES,NO SCAR
IF THINGS GO SOUTH
WE'LL BE IN THERE LIKE THE CAVALRY
WHEN I WAS A KID,MY,UH
MY FAVORITE SHOW WAS

I TRIED CALLING YOU A BUNCH OF TIMES
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR PHONE
I WAS IN MEETINGS ALL DAY

I'M SORRY,KYLE

FINALLY FEELS LIKE OLD TIMES AROUND HERE
WHAT'S THIS?
LILY?
WHAT IS IT?
DID YOU SPEND ALL THE CASH
BUYING THIS STUFF?
THEN WHAT? TALK TO ME
THE CASH REGISTER  AT THE FRONT DESK...
WAS OPEN...
AND WE NEEDED FOOD
AND ISABELLE NEEDED DIAPERS
YOU STOLE MONEY?
IT'S NOT LIKE I PLANNED IT
I MEAN,I HAD TO BEG FOR A BLANKET
AND THE DRAWER WAS OPEN,SO...
HE LEFT YOU STANDING THERE
WITH THE CASH REGISTER OPEN?
NO,NO,HE CLOSED IT
AT LEAST I THOUGHT HE DID
I DON'T KNOW--
IT WASN'T OPEN,AND THEN--
AND THEN IT WAS OPEN
THAT STILL DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT
THAT'S NOT HOW I LIVE MY LIFE
HAVE YOU LOOKED AROUND?
'CAUSE THIS ISN'T HOW I PLANNED
TO LIVE MY LIFE EITHER
LOOK,I KNOW IT WAS WRONG
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO TELL ME IT WAS WRONG
STOP SHAKING YOUR HEAD
JUST EAT SOMETHING,OKAY?
IT'S SILLY FOR ALL THIS FOOD
TO GO TO WASTE
GO AHEAD
I'M NOT HUNGRY
HOW MUCH FUN WAS THAT?
I LIKED IT. THANK YOU
SO WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?
YOUR NOTE JUST SAID "OUT."
LOTS OF PLACES
THE PIER,PIKE STREET
AND EVEN THE FERRY
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO--
YOU DIDN'T!
I TOLD YOU SHE'D FREAK!
RELAX,THEY'RE RUB-ONS
AS IN "FAKE."
BUT THEY'RE PRETTY,AREN'T THEY?
OH,YEAH,THEY'RE VERY PRETTY
NOW WHY DON'T YOU GO
GET STARTED ON YOUR HOMEWORK?
I'M IN TROUBLE
DO YOU AT LEAST LIKE THE SHIRT?
AND BY THE WAY--
YOU LIVE IN SEATTLE
AND YOUR KID'S NEVER
HEARD OF KURT COBAIN?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,DI?
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE HERE TO TEACH HER
ALL ABOUT TATTOOS
AND SUICIDAL ROCK STARS
AND BY THE WAY
WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION
TO TAKE HER OUT OF SCHOOL?
I'M HER AUNT
I DIDN'T KNOW I NEEDED PERMISSION
WELL,IF YOU'RE GOING
TO SEND HER TEACHER HOME FOR THE DAY
YOU DO
SITTING AT YOUR KITCHEN TABLE
ALL DAY LONG?
YEAH,THAT'S A BIG LOSS
WHAT ARE YOU KEEPING
THIS KID LOCKED AWAY FOR?
IF I WANTED YOUR OPINION
ON HOW I'M RAISING MY DAUGHTER
I'D ASK
MOMMY?
WHAT'S WRONG,SWEETHEART?
I THINK I HAVE TO THROW UP
WHAT DID YOU GIVE HER TO EAT?
ANYTHING SHE WANTED
OH. GOOD GOING,AUNT APRIL

I,UH,I HAD A PRESCRIPTION
SOME TRANQUILIZERS IN MY ROOM
AND NOW THEY'RE GONE
YOU DON'T NEED THOSE
YOU'VE BEEN CONDITIONED
TO THINK YOU NEED THEM
TAKING ANYTHING THAT SUPPRESSES
YOUR NATURAL OPENNESS
IS COUNTERINTUITIVE TO OUR PROGRAM
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SIT THROUGH
THE NUTRITION AND PURIFICATION LECTURE AGAIN
DID YOU HEAR THAT,BALDWIN?
THEY TOOK THE HALOPERIDOL!
YES,GARY,I HEARD IT
YOU WANT TO ABORT?
YOU WANT TO WALK OUT OF THERE?
EVERYTHING IS JUST-- JUST--
GETTING LOUDER IN MY HEAD ALREADY
IT'S ALREADY GETTING WORSE
VOICES ARE STARTING
TO BLEED THROUGH THE WALLS
JUST CALM DOWN,GARY.
WE'LL COME AND GET YOU IF WE NEED TO.
IT'S YOUR CALL.
GARY,TALK TO ME.
OKAY. UM...
Y-Y-YOU GUYS  ARE GOING TO HOLD UP
YOUR END OF THIS DEAL,RIGHT?
YES. OF COURSE.
<i>OKAY,OKAY.</i>
I'LL,UH,I'LL HOLD UP MY END,
AND I'LL HANG IN    AS LONG AS I CAN.
GOOD. WE'LL HANG IN WITH YOU.
NOW,LISTEN,GARY,
SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE ON THIS CHANNEL 24/7,REMEMBER?
YEAH RIGHT
RIGHT
I,UH,
I READ<THE SECRET SHARER>LAST NIGHT.
JUST LIKE YOUR SYLLABUS SAID.
THAT'S A GOOD START.
WELL,NOT JUST THE FIRST 20 PAGES.
I GOT REALLY INTO IT
I READ THE WHOLE THING.
19TH-CENTURY NOVELLAS NOT QUITE
THE HELL ON EARTH  YOU EXPECTED?
IT DEFINITELY WASN'T BORING.
I'VE GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS,THOUGH.
OKAY,WELL,
I HAVE OFFICE HOURS WEDNESDAYS,ONE TO FOUR.
OKAY,YEAH,I'LL TRY TO STOP BY.
OR WE COULD RUN BY
THE COOP  AND GRAB SOME COFFEE?
LIKE,RIGHT NOW?
I LIKE TALKING  ABOUT JOSEPH CONRAD.
IT'S WHY I PICKED THIS   FOR A LIVING.
WHERE DID YOU LEARN  TO DO ALL THIS?
MOM NEVER TAUGHT US  TO COOK.
I DON'T KNOW
I JUST LEARNED HOW.
HAD TO BE BETTER THAN YOU AT SOMETHING.
AUNT APRIL,DO YOU HAVE ANY KIDS?
NOPE.
NO KIDS.
ARE YOU MARRIED?
I USED TO BE.
ASK YOUR MOM WHAT
SHE THOUGHT OF MY EX-HUSBAND.
DON'T START.
YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM?
NEITHER DID APRIL,APPARENTLY.
SHE ONLY STAYED  WITH TREVOR FOR WHAT,SEVEN MONTHS?
YOU WERE HOSTILE FROM DAY ONE.
YOU NEVER GAVE HIM   A CHANCE.
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK HE DESERVED    MUCH OF A CHANCE.
HE WAS... KIND OF A MORON.
HE WAS 22.
SHOW ME ONE GUY    WHO ISN'T A MORON AT 22.
HE KNEW   YOU HATED HIM,
AND THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT   ANY EASIER
FOR US TO STAY TOGETHER.
COME ON.
YOU CAN'T KEEP BLAMING THAT ON ME.
I MEAN,JUST GROW UP.
OKAY,THIS WAS A MISTAKE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD  IDEA TO COME HERE,
BUT OBVIOUSLY I WAS WRONG.
I'LL GO PACK.
THERE'S A LITTLE HOTEL   UP THE STREET.
NO!
IT'S OKAY,HONEY.    WE'LL STILL SEE--
BUT THE POWER'S GOING TO GO OUT THERE TONIGHT,
AND YOU WON'T HAVE ANY LIGHTS.
WHAT IS SHE   TALKING ABOUT?
CAN I PLEASE BE EXCUSED?
MR. NAVARRO,IS SOMETHING WRONG?
THIS IS NO GOOD. I NEED MY HALOPERIDOL.
WHERE'S COLLIER?
MR. COLLIER'S IN A MEETING.
MR. NAVARRO?
MR. NAVARRO...
[DIANA]: <i>GARY,WHAT'S WRONG?</i>
[GARY]: <i>I JUST GOT</i>  <i>TO TALKTO COLLIER.</i>
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA,GARY.
MR. NAVARRO--
HE'S IN A MEETING!
MAKE IT STOP.
PLEASE,MAKE IT STOP.
MAKE IT STOP.
I NEED MY MEDICATION.
WHATEVER'S EATING YOU,OLD SON,WE'LL MAKE IT STOP.
COUNT ON THAT.
A 4400 WHO CAN READ MINDS?
SO YOU DO HAVE AN ABILITY.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE LIED TO ME,GARY.
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
THAT THIS GUY KNOWS   WHAT I'M THINKING?
BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE ANYONE INSIDE MY HEAD BUT ME.
JORDAN,THIS GUY'S ONE OF US.
WE CAN'T JUST STAND HERE AND LET HIM GET KILLED.
NOBODY'S KILLING ANYONE.
FIRST WE DETERMINE WHAT OUR MAN HERE KNOWS
AND THEN WE DISCUSS HIS FATE.
BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS I KNOW   THAT COULD GET YOU KILLED!
THAT COULD GET   ALL OF YOU KILLED.
CALL JARVIS.    TELL HER WE'RE GOING IN.
LOOK,IAN--
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP NOW!
HI. I'M EVAN.   WELCOME TO THE 4400 CENTER.
SECOND LEVEL'S NOT OPEN  TO VISITORS.
WE'RE NOT VISITORS.
HEY,LOOK,BUDDY,I'VE GOT A BADGE TOO,
AND THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.
WHAT THE HELL'S    HE DOING TO HIM?
LET HIM GO,
OR SO HELP ME,
I'LL SPLATTER YOUR BRAINS
ALL OVER   YOUR HIGHLY POLISHED FLOOR.
NOW,THAT IS ENOUGH.
DROP THAT WEAPON! NOW!
HOW THE HELL  DID YOU GET IN HERE?
YOU DON'T SOUND SO HAPPY   TO SEE US.
WELL,NOW.    WHAT IN THE HELL IS THIS?
NTAC AGENTS.
I DON'T APPRECIATE THE GOVERNMENT INTERFERING IN MY BUSINESS.
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WHO YOU DO BUSINESS WITH.
THEY'RE NOT BUYING WEAPONS.
THEY'RE PLANNING A COUP OVERSEAS,SOME TINY COUNTRY.
YOU SENT A SPY IN HERE,UNCLE TOMMY?
GOOD JOB.
YOU ALMOST GOT US ALL KILLED.
YOU TOO,MR. DRAVITT.
WELL,IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
IF YOUR FRIEND'S IMPRESSIONS WILL STAND UP IN COURT.
I GUESS I'M THE ONE SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL
WHO I DO BUSINESS WITH.
SHAWN,YOU CAN COME WITH US  IF YOU WANT.
GREAT.
I'LL TELL YOUR MOTHER YOU SAID HELLO.
GARY,YOU SHOULD HAVE    COME TO ME FIRST.
I'D HAVE TREATED YOU BETTER THAN THEY EVER WILL.
<i>WE'RE AT WAR HERE.</i>
<i>DON'T PICK THE LOSING SIDE.</i>
LOOK AT THE CUTE LITTLE BABY.
I THINK SOMEBODY WANTS TO TRY YOUR TOY,WALT.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
HI.
HI.
PUT HER BACK IN THE CAR?
WHY?
NOW,PLEASE.
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
THAT LITTLE BOY WAS BEING SWEET WITH HER.
I JUST DIDN'T WANT    ANYBODY GETTING HURT.
HURT?    WHO'S GOING TO GET HURT?
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THE TOY BACK?
WHAT'S GOING  TO HAPPEN THEN?
DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW  WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
THOSE THREE MEN  IN THE WOODS...
THEY WANTED US DEAD.
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.   THAT WAS ISABELLE.
WE BOTH KNOW IT,
AND THERE'S NO USE    IN PRETENDING OTHERWISE.
WHATEVER ISABELLE DOES,SHE DOES IT OUT OF LOVE FOR US.
SHE'S OUR DAUGHTER,RICHARD.
I KNOW SHE IS.
I LOVE HER RIGHT BACK,BUT SHE'S SOMETHING ELSE TOO,
AND I WISH TO GOD  I KNEW WHAT THAT WAS.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?
I'M FINE.
SO,WHAT?
SO COLLIER PLANNED TO SPEND   $30 MILLION
FUNDING MERCENARY ACTIVITY  IN SAO TOME?
THEY'VE HAD THREE COUPS SINCE    THEIR INDEPENDENCE IN '75.
MY GUESS?
COLLIER WAS TRYING  TO BUY NUMBER FOUR.
DID GARY HAPPEN TO HEAR
WHY COLLIER'S SO INTERESTED  IN AN ISLAND
OFF THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA?
WITHOUT HIS MEDICATION,
WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE GOT  THAT MUCH OUT OF HIM.
YEAH,BUT WE DO KNOW
THAT COLLIER THINKS HE'S HEADED TOWARDS A CONFLICT WITH SOMEONE
NTAC,THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT,I DON'T KNOW.
HE INSTALLS    A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT IN SAO TOME.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A PLACE TO GO  WHEN THINGS HEAT UP.
WHAT,LIKE A HOMELAND  FOR THE 4400?
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE A MAN FOR DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR.
THEY'RE NOT DELUSIONS
IF YOU CAN MAKE  THEM COME TRUE.
WE'RE ALWAYS  ONE STEP BEHIND COLLIER
BECAUSE WE KEEP SEEING HIM    AS SOME KIND OF CULT NUT.
WHAT WE SHOULD BE  ASKING OURSELVES IS,
BEFORE COLLIER WAS ABDUCTED,
DID HE EVER SET HIS MIND  TO SOMETHING
AND... NOT GET IT DONE?
THEY DIDN'T MAKE HIM ANY DUMBER IN THAT BALL OF LIGHT.
WELL,ANYWAY,WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT COLLIER WAS THINKING.
GARY FOUND OUT   FOR US.
TIME TO TURN HIM OVER  TO NTAC MEDICAL,RIGHT?
SOON.
"SOON"?
THE NSA IS CC'D
ANY TIME WE REGISTER A NEW 4400 ABILITY.
THEY HAVE BEEN LEANING ON D.C.
TO BORROW GARY FOR AN OP  THEY'VE GOT PLANNED.
NO-- NO MORE CLOAK-AND-DAGGER STUFF.
HE'LL SIT IN ON A FEW CONFERENCES.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH DIPLOMATS.
THEY DON'T ALWAYS SAY WHAT THEY THINK.
THAT WASN'T THE AGREEMENT    I MADE WITH HIM.
BUT TERMS HAVE CHANGED.
GARY'S TOO VALUABLE.
I GAVE HIM MY WORD.
YOU'RE TURNING ME INTO A LIAR.
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE GAME    ALMOST 20 YEARS.
MY GUESS IS,
YOU'VE COMMITTED ALL THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS,
JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.
I SHOULD HAVE LET HIM   STAY WITH COLLIER.
HE MIGHT HAVE USED HIM,BUT HE WOULD'VE HELPED HIM TOO.
DON'T YOU <i>EVER</i> USE ME AGAIN.
ALL I WANTED WAS TO PLAY BALL.
YOU GUYS PROMISED TO HELP,
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT,CAN YOU?
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE 4400.
IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE LIKE THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT US.
YOU KNOW THAT BAR,MEL'S?
CORNER OF LANCASTER  AND THIRD?
YOU FEEL LIKE JOINING ME?
WE DON'T GO TO BARS.
WELL,I'M GOING TONIGHT,WITH YOU OR WITHOUT YOU.
[previously on the 4400...]
we're not sure what's just happened.
The light is gone,
and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared.
Tom is the best agent I've ever worked with,
maybe the best you've got in this division.
I thought I was being re-assigned to field duty.
You are, effective immediately.
Work's been a little crazy lately
oh, the job?
I've been waiting for that one.
It finally feels like old times around here.
April, glad to hear from you.You're my sister.
Surprised?
How come I've never met you before?
- It's complicated.
- We've been busy.
I'm shawn farrell.
I am one of the 4400.
Can I sign you up for a tour?
I was looking for cousin, shawn farrell.
Policy prohibits me from discussing our membership.
Been to that place where you're living.
There's some serious stepford wives vibes going on there.
You know that, right?
These centers,they're a chance to bring people together.
Sounds like someone got inside your head.
I will not allow these shadows from your past to alter your perceptions.
The goal is what matters.
Ensure the future.
Save the planet.
If maia's having visions,you should know about it
and you should know what they are.
Isabelle is six months old.
I don't know why she talks to me and not to you.
Talks?
Ntac? Collier?
I don't know who it is,
but someone knows we're 4400s.
Start packing
How'd it go today, daddy?
That bad, huh?
Nobody wants to buy time shares in wilmington, idaho.
Baja california, maybe.
If I were you, I'd go in there
and tell them "either let me have the good listings,
or I quit".
The whole staff wants baja,honey
and I don't have the seniority.
How is that fair?
You've been a salesman longer than any of them.
Salesman, not telemarketer.
It's different.
Hey, hey. Appelbaum.
Payday.
Leave him alone!
He's trying to pay you back!
This your beer, appelbaum?
You don't mind if I quench my thirst, do you?
Honey, stay back.
Stay back.
I just need a couple more weeks.
Something will turn around.
You know, in my business
you hear every sob story in the book
but I got to tell you,yours is a new one
"disappeared 15 years ago,
"came back in a ball of light
wife died
daughter dropped out of school
" You got a bad break,
but you borrowed the money,
and now you're going to have to pay me back.
I'll figure something out.
Oh, you do it quickly,
because you and I are going to talk again in 48 hours.
I thought you 4400s got special powers.
How come you're such a big nothing?
Just lucky, I guess.
All right, let's go.
Thanks for the beer.
Should be at eric's place tomorrow.
Be nice to see a friendly face,
maybe sleep in for a change.
Sounds good.
You like eric, right?
Yes You guys got along in quarantine.
Richard, I'm late.
Like, "I might be pregnant" late.
You sure?
No, I'm not sure.
I'm late.
Well, we just have to wait and see.
Wait and see?
We could go to the drug store, maybe...
get one of those test things.
And what would you want it to say?
I'd like it to say, "congratulations.
You have a job, a house, and a future.
You're ready for another child.
" But I don't think it's going to say that.
No.
Probably not.
$3,150... 32, 33... $3,400.
Well, that should keep that creep happy for a while.
I'm sorry about your car.
I'll ride the bus to work.
Sorry about the television.
I'll read a book.
Appelbaum, the miracle man, huh?
You notice anything different about me?
My god...
75 pounds in two days.
Now, at first, I thought the termites had gotten me.
You know, I was sick-- cancer.
Doctors ran all the tests. Turns out I'm fine.
But
how could I lose all that weight?
Then I thought of you.
Me and you, we shared a bottle of beer,
and you're one of those 4400s.
What does that prove?
Nothing yet.
But let's-- let's find out.
I want you to take a sip.
Because if I'm right,
you made me lose all this weight,
and then the same thing should happen to my wife.
Who-- mm...
though I love very much,
I do-- could stand to lose maybe 20 pounds.
30.
Go ahead.
Drink up.
Applebaum...
these people who took you,
they set you up for life.
They snatched up a bum salesman,
and they sent you back "the human diet."
"The human diet."
I like that.
Go ahead.
So long ago, another life
I can feel your heart beat
it's not a dream remember us
I can see it in your eyes
we'll find our place in time
our place in time beyond the sun
we'll find our place in time
our place in time to call our own
Chloe
thank you thank you
reading Jordan's book was an absolute Revelation
I bought copies for all my back up dangers
and we discuss it every night after the show
she cut her tour short
yes,because i felt like i had to be here
obviously,i'm not one of 4400
but i expect to be treated just like any other student here
if i'm lucky enough
to tap into an ability
i will use it to ensure the world a brighter future
congratulations,Chloe Greezer,you have achieved "first key"
thank you
Last year, she was into Compila.
it's amazing, i lost 23 pounds
i haven't weighed less than 130 since college
told you applebaum was a real deal,right?
you have been happy harrassing him anymore
honey,what we got from him is way more than he owns me,right?
come on
turn around
Question of the day
who is Trent Applebaum and why is Drandix coporation calling me about it.
Applebaum disappeared in the late 80's
he's in phone-sells,right?
and now he's selling himself
he claimed that his saliva is catalogued for weight loss
Applebaum backed his claim up?
two good satisfied customers
married couple,one drop 75 pounds,the other 23
particularly over a night
my god
they got a hand of the future on this one
if they really give him this ability,it could be the cure for adiposity
yeah,it will change the world
that's about to change Trent Applebaum's world
he hired a lawyer,an agent
they were asking 20 million dollars
but Trent's in a bidding war with three other company so...
who knows what the final number will end up
a 4400 selling exclusive rights to his ability is legal
our lawyer is looking into conjunction
but at the moment,no legislation specifically prevents it
then our guy Stands to be a very rich man
hmm
maybe we should go see him
yeah,find out if he's really worth 20 million dollars
hey hey jet pilot
did i get it right?
close enough
so...you sounded a little freaked out on the phone
anything i should know about?
better that you don't
look at you two,love birds from quarantine building B
this little cutie must be Isabelle. your daddy told me all about you
i bet he did
look,come on in.i'll show you guys the guest room
or maybe somebody sleep on the couch
not too shabby from my first college
it was a good paper,well fall out
so what's the minus for?
well, i always like to leave a bit room for improvement
last days of pompeii
yeah,they throw that party every year
you should go,go out some steam you've earned it
i hate to go alone,you're up for it?
i probably love to have remembered that threat
not my scene, but don't let me stop you
i don't know how it works, they put something inside me
one of those enzyme or whatever
so someone drinks from the same bottle as you do and they lose weight
maybe we should give him a demonstration
cut it out,Louis
she thinks she needs to lose eight pounds
try ten
sweetie,you're beautiful,you don't need to lose anything
he's right about that, you don't
a lot of kids go to college when they're eighteen
and Lis had to take a job at a diner
we were apart for sixteen years
but while i was gone, they gave me a way to make it up to her
Mr.Applebaum, no one's telling you not to provide for your daughter
but a 4400 putting his gift on the open market is the first
we wanna make sure nobody gets to take advantage of that
not you, not the buyer,other 4400...
you don't have to teach me about selling
i've been a salesman my whole life
most of the stuff i paddled
junk
but now i got the product that everybody wants
and only i can provide,i'm the damn product
nobody is putting Trent Appelbaum back in the bottle
my father fought in Korea, infantry
i flew in 36
Eric told me
daddy admired you guys
he said there were only 25 black pilots in the whole air force
who allowed to flylike everybody else
there weren't a lot of us, it's true
the first person i met long time ago
couldn't metion the Korea War
that was a big deal in our house,we always go to pray
yeah,my grandfather and my mom said he'd take me too
except it was called "Armistice Day" back day
for world war one
put on those boot dress, go visit old buddy
daddy looks so handsome in his uniform
i bet you'd too
i'd like to meet him sometime
yeah,well,too late
he passed away two years ago this August
i'm sorry to hear that
thank you
he would really love to meet you too
the guy was 81, he was born four years after i was
well,lucky for you,i like elder man
so Rrichard, we've known what were you up to in 1951
how about lately
well, i've been working as an alternate weekend
oh,really?
so what brings you to this part of the country,it's kind of remote for vacation
they came to see me, as 4400, we gotta stick together
we have bond that you mere human will never understand
Eric,you freak me out when you talk that 4400 unity crap
not much of a talker,are you,Lily?
i'm not really used to be in social situation since these days

a boddy art emporium
and for five hours tomorrow
i'm the featured artist

one hour
Shawn, have you seen Chloe's schedule?
why would i see Chloe's schedule,Devon?
she has an interview with media three o'clock tomorrow?
oh,hopefully,she will mention the center
but her nutrition and purification class is at three o'clock
yeah, i think i heard Jordan said she was excused from the...
she's been on the microbiotic diet for three years
also she says
look, i'm sure Jordan plans on treating Chloe like any other student
Ok?
No, i'm ready to close.
I don't wanna wait,just tell him it's done
and i'll be in tomorrow
alright,thanks,Celine

Ok, just hate to see make yourself sick
no one is sick, we're hungry and starving,now go go

i'm starving
Morning-- you're not dressed?
Those guys from arkham films are here to pitch us.
Oh, the recruitment video.
Yeah, well, you can handle that meeting, can't you?
Well, yeah, sure,
if you're too busy, yeah.
Hey.
Guess jordan's getting a late start this morning.
My bad.
I'm going to just jump in the shower, okay?
Shower sounds good, chloe.
Close your mouth, shawn.
You'll draw flies.
One-on-one tutoring with a first key?
That'S.that's new.
First key or not,
chloe demands--
deserves a different level of attention.
She's our entree, shawn,
into the entertainment community.
Jordan, you have an entire chapter in your book that rips celebrity culture.
It's a cancer that separates people,
that helps define the haves and have-nots.
And 4400 culture is all about unity.
Yes.Please, shawn
do not quote me back to myself.
The fact is,celebrities have deep pockets and deeper insecurities,
and we can use both to our advantage.
You can be a manipulative prick.
You know that?
Yeah.
Well.
it helps to use your entire skill set when you're trying to change the world.
You and lily should think about putting down some roots here.
I think all this running is fraying you both around the edges.
You noticed.
Hard not to.
You can do a lot worse than white bird.
It's quiet.
Everyone minds their own business.
Eventually you're going to have to stop criss-crossing the highways.
Might as well do it here,before you run out of road.
Thank you, by the way.
for not asking what we're running from.
I figured if you wanted me to know, you'd tell me.
Look,richard.
I got all the work I can handle up in livingston,
keeping up these movie stars' second homes.
I could use a hand.
You offering me a job?
They used to call us handymen.
Now we're property managers.
Either way, you'd be working with me,
not for me.
And if you'll just sign right here..
as agreed-- your signing bonus.
When do I start?
You're making breakfast.
As you pour the milk over your cereal,
you notice that there's a photo of a missing child on the side of the carton.
It takes you a moment to realize that it's a picture of you at 10 years old.
this one's giving me the chills.
Who's making this stuff up?
Moron.
Devon, do not let jordan hear you say that.
The two of them hooked up last night.
Yeah,and by the looks of it,probably this morning, too.
There's a telephone number on the missing persons report.
It's the number of your childhood home.
Stay here?
You mean permanently?
It's a nice town,
and eric says I can start work tomorrow.
Look,lily.
We've got to get you off the road,
especially if you're pregnant again.
I'm not.
You sure?
positive.
Please don't try and pretend you're not relieved.
Relieved?
Lily, I was trying to wrap my head around it,that's all.
Especially if we're not going to be running anymore.
I don't know about this place, richard.
Isabelle thinks--
oh, let me guess.
We should move on.
I was hoping we could go to salem, oregon.
I have some relatives there.
I think they might be willing to help us out and keep quiet about it.
Salem?
That's a city.
Maybe we could get lost in a crowd for a change.
This place
this life,it feels right to me.
This is eric's life.
It's not yours.
It's not ours.
No,this is not a negotiating stance.
It's my answer-- no.
Goodbye.
So let me guess-- the answer is no?
That was a rep from the yoyotron corp.
They want to sign maia to a $300,000-a-year holding contract.
But maia doesn't have any ability anymore.
Well, you don't need any to make any of these deals.
They're signing 4400s up on spec.
They want them in their pocket in case something develops down the line.
Well, you did the right thing by saying no.
Tom.
about maia.
What?She's okay, isn't she?
She's fine.
I've been trying to figure out the right time to tell you this.
I probably should have done it right away, but.
you know those visions that maia used to have?
It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped.
How long have you known?
Not long.
I only found out because I read her diary,
but it was an eyeful.
You going to tell jarvis?
I'd rather not turn my daughter's diary over to the government.
Hey, don't give me that look, tom.
You kept shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.
Guess we're even now.
See how cool that looks?
Your aunt, she's a real artist.
Oh, say it again, billy boy.
I don't think my sister heard you.
Oh, I heard him.
You're a star.
Believe it.
As soon as I heard april was appearing here,
I booked my time right away.
So did pretty much all of my buddies.
that's impressive.
I'm proud of you.
Wait a minute.
You didn't actually just say
that you were proud of me?
Cut it out.Of course I am.
I always thought you thought I was a loser.
Did you really think that?
Yeah, I really did.
April.
all I said was that I liked the tattoo.
You don't always wear your helmet, do you?
You should wear one tonight.
Why's that?
You won't make it over to
monica's house if you don't.
Does that hurt?
How do you know about my girlfriend?
I really think you should wear your helmet.
You killed her.
Dmitri?
What happened to you?
My wife, she's gone.
Doctors say that she starved to death.
I'm next.
You killed us both.
How many times am I supposed to tell you?
I don't know how I got to that store.
and I sure as hell don't
remember breaking any window.
Not remembering is no excuse.
and stop telling me somebody spiked your drink.
The police ran tests.kyle.
There's no ghb in your system.
What else could it be?
You spent three years in a coma.
You have no business drinking anything!
Okay.so I screwed up.
I'm sorry.What more do you want?
How about acknowledging that this was serious?
Do you know how close they were to
charging you with breaking and entering?
Which by the way is a felony.
If I didn't play the ntac card.
you'd be sitting in a jail cell right now.
Can I go to bed?
No.this is serious.
You want to make up for last time.
kyle.I get it.
I get it.
but we need to talk about
some ground rules for you.
I'm not a kid.
I don't need ground rules.
I wouldn't know that from tonight.
Answer it.
What?
You're kidding me.
Yeah.I'll be right in.
We'll finish this later.
What happened to laying down the law?
Oh.right.Something more important came up.
Just go upstairs.kyle.
Just go upstairs.
Richard?
What are you doing out here?
Oh.I'm just getting some air.
Well.hop in.We'll give you a ride back.
I was reading about your air
force unit on the internet yesterday.
No kidding.
I looked at it a couple times too.
You guys were one of the most decorated flying squads--
tara.
will you stop pestering the man about his past?
It's okay.
I don't mind.
Well. as long as you're feeling talkative.
I've got a question for you--
what did a brother have to do back in the '50s
before they'd let you fly a plane.huh?
Polish the officer's boots on the weekends?
David.
No.no.no.seriously.I mean.
I'm wondering.
Boy must've done some serious bowing and
scraping before they'd hand you them keys.right?
Okay.that is enough.
I'm so sorry.richard.
No problem.
Some people the less they know the more they talk.
Oh.I know some things.
I know a lot more than you realize.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means quit fawning over the
man and keep your mouth closed.
Why don't you just let me out right here?
Hey.
you sit back and relax.huh?
Now this here?
It's called marriage.
That's all.
You know what I'm talking about.
Dmitri's dead?
Organ failure resulting from
malnutrition just like his wife.
They were supposed to lose 20 or 30 pounds.
not starve to death.
Are you sure there isn't anyone else?
Family?
Friends?
No.
Did you kiss anyone?
Share a drinking glass?
No.there's no one else.
We think we know what happened to the kazars.
There's a protein in your saliva that
hyper-accelerated their metabolism.
It's a cagey one too.
It stimulates the brain to release epinephrine
and it breaks down fat cells at the same time.
No wonder they burned up calories
faster than their bodies could take them in.
Well.they could eat anything and
everything and still starve to death.
That doesn't make any sense.
We're supposed to be helping people.right?
That's why we were sent back.
All I wanted was to make good for my daughter.
Now I'm a murderer.
You didn't mean to do it trent.
That supposed to make me feel better?
We're going to have to keep you here.
Try and find a way to remove the protein from your system.
Well.the good news is we caught it early.
A lot more people could have been infected.
Oh.no.
I was at drandix this morning.
I spent two hours in their lab giving tissue samples.
Oh my god.
Look this isn't my fault.
and I have the documents to prove it.
How many people did you test?
Look.my bosses.
They wanted a clinical trial up
and running by the end of the day.
They said."make it your top priority."
How many?
A hundred.
Whoa.whoa.whoa.
Hey.what's going on?
What's going on?
Why would devon try to kill herself?
Obviously she's a very troubled young girl.
But she's going to be okay though?
Yeah.
they were able to pump her
stomach out at the emergency room.
She's at home recovering.
Okay.
I think what we need to
do right now is continue our work.
Kyle if the cops say you didn't get "g"ed.
you have to believe them right?
They could have screwed up the test.
I didn't drink that much.
Well maybe your dad's right.
Maybe you shouldn't drink at all.
I hope it was just the booze.
Well.what else could it have been?
When I first came out of my coma.
I wasn't quite myself.
I hope it's not happening again.
I don't know exactly what you mean.
but if you're losing chunks of time.
you should talk to your dad about it.
What's he going to do?
Turn me over to ntac medical?
I'm not going back into quarantine.
No way.
If you're looking for eric--
now there's your goddamn apology.
What are you talking about?
She was at me all morning.
"Richard this." "Richard that."
I should "go apologize."
From here on in.
you stay the hell away from my wife.
You're crazy.right?
I've got nothing going on with your wife.
Now you'd better step away
and take a deep breath or something.
Man.I step where I please.
Now.listen to me.
You're going to go home.
and you're going to apologize to tara.
and if you've got any brains at all.
you're going to start treating her better.
because if you don't.
one day someone is going to take her away from you.
Now get your ass out of here.
Trent.this isn't helping.
I had to see what I did.
You want to do something?
Get back to the lab.
Help them work on a way to counter this.
Just let me call elise first huh?
She'll be wondering where I was all night.
Help me.
Elise?
Daddy?
Help me
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to lose 10 pounds.
Baby.
I told you you were perfect.
I used one of your water glasses.
We're going to get you help.
We're going to get everybody help.
Tom.
We've got something.
What?
Tell me.
Well.I asked the guys downstairs if we
could approach this like a smallpox vaccine
use trace amounts of the antigen to build
resistance and counter the effects of the disease.
These people are starving to death.
Yeah.but it's because of a chemical reaction.
Now.they biopsied trent's liver.
That's where the protein is coming from.
So if we extract this protein.
they can make a serum that will stimulate
antibody production in the victims.
but they're going to have
to harvest tissue to do it.
How much of his liver would they have to use?
Given how much time we have.
they want to take all of it.
I've never seen a sunset like that.
the way it takes forever to go down.
It's like it doesn't want to give up the sky.
It's a pretty sky.
Worth holding on to.
I'm sorry.
What for?
For letting you believe even for a second.
that I wouldn't want to have another child with you.
I want to build a future for us lily.
I just need to get my feet under me first.
Well maybe if we stay here you can.
I mean it richard.
You love it here.
I don't want to stand in the way of that.
I'd sure hate to give up that sky.
Me too.
Are you even sure this will work?
Well.it's elise's only shot--
her and all the others.
We've got a matching donor lined up.
It's still a big risk.
but say the word and the liver's on its way.
Okay.then.
You want to close this deal.
here's the fine print--
you want elise to go to school.
It's already done.
I talked to drandix.
They've agreed to open up a college fund in her name.
Sold.
Great.
Your mom put them in a vase for me.
She's a very nice lady.
They're very pretty shawn.
but you didn't have to.
Well I wanted to.
I hope jordan's not too upset.
No.
no.
Hey.
He's probably too busy with his pet superstar.
Devon.
what are you doing thinking
about jordan and chloe right now?
Hey.
hey.
You have no idea how I feel about him.
How deep it runs.
I worship jordan for everything he's given me.
for allowing me to be so close to him.
He took me to a place I never thought possible.
Devon.
are you telling me that you and jordan.
jordan's heart is full of love.
He shares that love with me.
It's an honor.
An honor that chloe doesn't deserve.
She's not a real student of jordan's.
Billy?
God.what happened to you?
At the shop the other night.
I got clipped by a car on the way out of the parking lot.
But you were wearing your helmet.weren't you?
Yeah.
Doctors said it saved my life.
How'd you know that was going to happen to me?
Children's intuition.
I'm glad you're okay.
Yeah.
Me too.
It's a shame to lose you so soon.
Sucks huh?
I thought my atlanta dates were pushed.
Now they're threatening to sue if I don't show.
You've made such progress
in such a short period of time.
Yeah.
Believe me.that doesn't happen very often.
Well.
I sure as hell hope not.
You know me jordan--
I like feeling special.
You are.
This was amazing.
I can't wait to get back here.
Goodbye.
Talk about a quick study.
Third key status in less than a week huh?
Noblesse oblige shawn.
She benefits and so do we.
It's too bad all of the women that
you screw don't share the same benefits.
That's cheap and childish.
I expect more of you.
I know the feeling.
I am so sorry you two.
What's wrong?
It's david.
He just looked on the website for the 4400s.
It said that you two were missing.
that you hadn't reported
in the way you were supposed to.
I heard him on the phone just now.
He's reporting you guys to the government.
Sorry about that idiot david.man.
I would have loved to have you two around.
Thanks for putting us up.
Uh-uh.I can'T.
take it.man.
Call it a down payment on your next house.
wherever that may be.
Hope you find a safe place.
I thought it was here.
Is my dad going to be all right?
Well.he's going to be in intensive care for a while.
but the transplant.it went well.
Your dad's a hero.
I'm going to tell him that when he wakes up.
If you have something to say.
now would be a good time.
You know what?
You want to hand out keys like they're junk mail.
you be my guest.
That woman will play to 20.000 people every night.
wearing our insignia.promoting our image.
Image?
How does nailing your
secretary help our image.jordan?
I'm not perfect.
I never pretended--
I don't need perfection!
I just want you to stop giving me reason
to think of you as some kind of hypocrite.
When you're running this place.shawn.
you can behave as nobly as you'd like.
Meaning what?
Meaning one day all of this will be yours.
The paperwork's been drawn up.
The lawyers know what to do.
Everything's in place.
But you're not going anywhere?
Nevertheless.
I sleep better knowing my life's
work is in the hands of the saintly.
the unsullied shawn farrell.
So we thought we had a cure
for the world's obesity problems.
Yeah.and instead.
we've got two dead bodies.
a hundred other people in recovery.
and one corporation scrambling to cover its ass.
It looks like the great 4400 gold rush is over.
Making the point of this little exercise what.exactly?
Well.maybe they got it wrong.
They thought they had a cure.but they didn't.
I mean.they're from the future.
but they're still human beings.right?
Let's not rush to judgment.
We know rapid weight loss is
the effect on the human body.
but if the purpose of this protein is
to provoke metabolic chemical change.
it could have other applications.
Like.
I don't know-- breaking down toxic waste.
It could rid the ocean of pollutants.
maybe even restore in the ozone layer.
So in other words.
the possibilities are pretty much endless.
That's all they are right now though
possibilities.
I mean we're years away from practical use.
But with his new liver.
appelbaum won't be able to produce the chemical anymore.
He doesn't have to.
Now that we've got it isolated.
we can reproduce it and
find out what we've really got here.
So trent earned his golden parachute after all.
Maybe his daughter can study chemistry in college.
Hey.
All right.
There won't be any interruptions on my end.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah.
Okay.
Um.
Here to say thanks.
for getting me off the hook with the cops.
Look kyle.
I know you're going to make mistakes.
I did when I was your age.
The only thing I ask is you
let me help you learn from them.
Makes sense.
So I just need to know.
you told me everything that
happened that night.right?
Yeah.
previously on the 4400...
We're not sure what's just happened.
The light is gone.
and thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.
Some of them have been missing over 60 years.
None of them have any memory
of what happened to them.
I saw your brother.
Shawn?
You know those visions that maia used to have.
It turns out she was only
pretending that they stopped.
Don't give me that look, tom.
You kept shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.
I've cured emphysema, leukemia...
I don't get why these attacks keep coming back.
That baby really kicked your ass.
Heidi, it's mommy.
Who?
I have another family now, and I'm sorry.
I know that's not fair to you, but...
brian, I am still part of your life.
If you're losing chunks of time,
you should talk to your dad about it.
You told me everything that happened that night, right?
Yeah.
It's okay, it's okay.
Jordan.
You don't have to keep vigil, shawn.
Are you going to cancel the appearance at riverfront park?
No. That would be a mistake.
They're not just honoring me.
They're honoring the center and all the work we've done.
- A new neurological clinic just opened in atlanta.
- No, look, look.
I've been to all the specialists, shawn.
There's no name for what I have.
We can't just give up.
There's got to be a way to
figure out what that baby did to you.
I know what that baby did to me.
It saved my life.
What?
What are you talking about?
When I touched lily's pregnant
belly and was hit with that pain
I realized I'd been judged and found wanting.
- By a baby that wasn't even born yet?
- In that moment...
I was forced to see the truth about myself,
about my motives toward the 4400,
and they were...not pure.
That baby tried to kill you.
And it succeeded.
It killed the old jordan collier,
and I was reborn,
pure of purpose.
All I've done since,
everything I've built,
I owe to richard,
to lily... and to that child.
I'll get it.
- Hey.
-  Hi.
Come in. Lily...
look who's here.
We would have called,
but heidi wanted to surprise you.
Heidi...
hi, mom.
She's so cute.
Now that you guys are living on the block,
I figured it was time for heidi to meet her real mom.
That makes you my second dad.
I guess so.
Mom, why are you crying?
Lily, are you all right?
- Lily?
- Lily?
Lily?
Lily?
sweetheart, wake up.
It was a dream...
more like a nightmare.
No, no.
We were living next door to heidi and brian,
and we were all getting along.
And the house...
richard, it was so pretty.
So why were you crying?
I guess I knew it wasn't real.
How long can we keep going
before someone catches up to us?
We just got to keep moving,
stay ahead of collier and ntac.
I'm just so tired of running.
We're going to find a place to stop running.
It's out there...
got to be.
That's good.
You've come so far.
Nice use of color.
It's shaping up, greg,
but I think it could use some work.
That's as good as it gets.
Don't waste your time.
Ms. Tobey,
would you come with us, please?
Harmon.
Harmon...
sam...
what's this all about?
Ms. Tobey,  I'm placing you under arrest.
Arrest?
For what?
Child abuse.
Oh, my god. What...
<i>So long ago, another life</i>
<i>I can feel your heart beat</i>
<i>it's not a dream remember us</i>
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>
<i>our place in time beyond the sun</i>
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>
<i>our place in time to call our own</i>
Look
I know his birth certificate says the kid's 21.
but emotionally kyle is still a teenager.
I've got to accept the fact that he's gonna screw up like a teenager.
He'll learn from his mistakes.
get it out of his system.
but shawn--
it's been a year.
How could he cut us out like that?
And danny.he's eating himself up inside.
He used to be such a sweet boy.
Yeah.I remember what pop used to say--
"you think you've got problems?
Wait till you become a parent.
Little did we know.
Yeah.
What do you want to bet they're talking about us downstairs?
That's what they live for.
If they didn't have us to worry about.they'd die of boredom.
I've seen you around campus.
I saw you too.
Why didn't you say something?
It's been.like. four years.
I mean.what was I supposed to say.
"welcome back from coma world"?
I don't know.I guess
seeing you reminded me of shawn.
You two were always so tight.
And you were like our shadow--
"where you going?Can I come too?"
I thought you guys were so cool.
I was 14.What did I know?
Mom says you talked to him?
I don't think he heard me.
You know.
I used to blame shawn for everything--
stealing nikki.
running out on us the way he did.
breaking mom's heart.
But it wasn't his fault.
And the bastards who took him sent him back a freak.
They're the ones.
Guess they screwed us all up.
Well.I want to thank councilman lowe on behalf of the 4400 center for this wonderful honor.
In funding this cleanup project.
I wanted to pay tribute not only to the glories of the past but to the promise of the future.
I believe that the actions we take.
the choices we make
will create the kind of future that we and our children and their children will live in.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey!
What?
Get your hands off of me.
What do you want to do.break it?
Stop it!
Hey! What's the deal?
These people don't belong here.
No.you're the ones who don't belong here.
This used to be our home until you scumbags decided to make everything beautiful and kicked us out.
It's okay.You can let 'em go.
They were stealing food.
Well.last time I checked.the food was free.
Don't make me pull rank.
Come on.
Yes.sir.mr.Farrell.
Thank you.
Big shot.huh?
I'm impressed.
I'm really sorry that we trashed your home.
I am.
You should be.
It's a hell of a lot warmer here than crashing near I-90 bridge.
Food's still free.right?
Yes.Absolutely.
Please be my guest.
Yeah.we will.
Protect the future.huh?
Got to have one first.
Even on the map.fairview seems far away.
That's four hours tops.
This is my first time spending the night away from maia.
Isn't your sister with her?
The one with all the tattoos?
Sorry.
Those beer kegs kyle ordered should be showing up right about now.
Yeah.You read these charges?
"Teacher is accused of reckless endangerment.
placing her students' health.welfare.and safety at risk.
" Could that be any more vague?
Well.that could be anything from grabbing them on the arms to touching them on the privates.
Or maybe she did nothing.
Yeah."Nothing" would be my vote.
A 4400 serial killer was bad enough.
but a 4400 child molester?
You're damn right we don't want her back!
Not now.not ever.
Look.
I don't know what's going to happen with ms.Tobey.
She's out on bail.right?
That's right.
And her bond was paid by
parents from this school.
Yeah.and if they're not worried about their kids.
then we'll worry for them.
Ask sal here.He'll tell you.
His kid was abused.
same as melinda and teddy.
What about your child.mr...
Venner.Frank venner.
It's not like she didn't try with my boy.
Greg just happened to be one of the lucky ones.
Tried what?
Now.who the hell are you two?
I'm agent skouris.This is agent baldwin.
We're with ntac.
Great.
You got here just in time.
Yeah.Cops let her go.
You can take her to quarantine or stick her back in jail.
She hasn't been found guilty of anything yet.
She's a 4400.isn't she?
She should never have been allowed back in this school in the first place.
According to the preliminary exams.
none of the kids showed any signs of abuse.
No marks.no bruises?
No physical signs.at any rate.
So what are we talking about? Some kind of mental abuse?
Personally.I'm not convinced it's abuse at all.
but there's no denying that some of her students have been changed.
Changed?
In what way?
That was beautiful.
I guess.
You're telling me two weeks ago you'd never played a violin.
Never even touched one.
Hey. I only took this class 'cause
art appreciation's supposed to be a guaranteed "A.
You're supposed to learn about dead painters and stuff.
It's so cool.
I look at a bunch of clay.
I see the figure I want to mold.
I just carve away the pieces
I don't need and there it is.
You should see the way she stares at you.
It's like she's drilling a hole.
trying to get in there and rearrange your brain.
One minute. she was touching my shoulder.
The next thing I remember.she was handing me a violin.
And I'm standing there wondering what the
hell am I doing with a paintbrush in my hand.
And then I see this block of clay.
and it was like.
"where have you been all my life?
" My dad's big dream was to get me a football scholarship.
It used to be my dream.too.
But this painting stuff.
I'm really into it now.
Ms.Tobey's the best teacher I ever had in my life.
My dad says these kids may seem normal now.
but in.like.two years.
they might develop brain tumors.go blind.crazy.
who knows?
You guys should throw her back in jail.
Your dad.
he wouldn't be frank venner.by any chance.would he?
How'd you know?
Oh.just...
a wild guess.
Hurt my students?
That's so ridiculous.
Well.it's not ridiculous to these parents.
People get scared when they don't recognize their kids.
But they're still the same kids.
I just find what's already inside them and help bring it out.
How do you do that?
I study them.
Sometimes.
there's a light in their eyes.
like a tiny flame.
and while I'm watching.
it gets brighter.
That's when I know there's something in them.
something beautiful.
So this light.have you seen it in anyone else?
It doesn't seem to work with grownups.
It doesn't work with every kid.either.
like this one boy.greg venner.
I keep looking.
but so far...
I think his father's pretty adamant that you stop looking.
Frank?
I taught frank.
He was one of my first students back in '72.
The fact is.
I probably taught half the parents who are out to get me.
This is crazy.
I-- I haven't done anything wrong.
I need to get back to my kids.
The people who took me.
it can't be an accident they gave me this wonderful gift.
That's why they sent me back.
to use it.
Tyler?
Richard tyler?
Richard tyler.
Yes.I'm richard tyler.
as wind carved the lung feel like 10 hours
WHAT've WE GOT SHOW FOR IT?
less than 20 bucks
what we ganna do?
gotta make it lived
who's got this
no one  friends treat
Hey.shawn.
look who showed.
I was in the mood for pizza.
I didn't feel like eating alone.
soˇŁˇŁˇŁ
my very own fairy godfather.
Or are you just some rich boy looking to rent some down-and-dirty for the night?
I'm not here for that.
What's the matter? Am I not good enough for you?
Maybe I'm not good enough for you.
I can get behind that.
Yo.wayne.Pepperoni.
You going to stand there and watch.
or you going to sit down and eat?
Hello?
Brian.
It's me.lily.
Lily.where are you?
You know.ntac's been calling me all summer trying to find you.
Brian.look.
I need your help.
RichardˇŁˇŁˇŁhe's been arrested.
ou're a lawyer.
I need you to call the sheriff's office in weldon.idaho.
See what you can find out.
Well.I don't know what I can do for the guy.
I'm not a criminal lawyer.
Brian.if you don't want to help--
I swear to god.lily.
you disappear for over a year.
and then you call me up with these stories about the police arresting your boyfriend--
richard's my husband.
We have a child.
a six-month-old girl.
How's heidi?
She's good.
Started seventh grade andˇŁˇŁˇŁ
aced her first semester.
That's wonderful.
Brian.
I'm sorry to be bothering you with this.
but I have nowhere else to turn.
Okay.I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.
I got to admit.
the first time mike came home with that violin and started playing.
his mom and me.we were both a little spooked.
So why did you help pay heather's bail?
I would've paid the whole thing if I could've afforded it.
My wife.she shot a video of mike playing.
sent it over to the conservatory.
Next day.they called back.
said our son was a prodigy.
Did you tell them he'd been playing for only two weeks?
Well.they thought I was putting them on.
talked about how his playing was worthy of a scholarship.
You know.I thought this kid was going to wind up working on the assembly line like his old man.
Now he's got a way out.
Hmm.
Ms.Tobey's at ntac today for a physical.
We're asking the parents of the students she's "gifted" to come in to be interviewed.
No problem.I'll call his mom.
We'll do anything we need to to get heather back in that classroom.
Great.
Thanks.
You should've seen them chowing down on the pizza.
Just getting enough to eat.
you konw it's such a struggle.
And you made that struggle a little easier.
I'm proud of you.shawn.
I'm thinking about going back down there.
There's so much they need--jackets.sleeping bags.
maybe a couple of first aid kits.
Basic stuff to survive.you know.
You give them all the supplies they need.
- All right.
- But look.
whatever you do.shawn.
don't reveal your healing ability.
Why?
'Cause they can't pay? No.
because if you heal one of them.
you'll have to heal them all.
I mean it.
Not even you can do that.
Yeah.
I'm listening.
When was this?
Sweet.
I'm a little rusty.
One of these days.I'm going to write a concept album
about my time on the street.
Oh.
I'm gonna win a grammy.
make the bling-bling.
you know.and get a private jet.
one of those big old gated houses with enough room for wayne.kimmy.and shadow.
Sounds like a plan.
Yeah. It matches your eyes.sweetie.
Hey.
First time in months I haven't seen him shivering.
It's amazing what a warm coat'll do.
You got yourself that guitar. huh?
No.Actually.you know what?
I got you a guitar.
What's the matter. baby girl?
You act like you never had a present before.
It's been a while.
You touch this.you die.
- "Touch it.you die?"
- I guess so.
What does that mean?
I hate lines.Hate waiting in 'em.
Trust me.there'll be no waiting tonight.
I been to this club plenty of times.
I know the bouncer.He'll let us walk right in.
I hope you're right.
I hate waiting in lines.
Hey.that book you're reading is nothing but lies.
Excuse me.
I'm talking to you.
That trash is going to rot your mind.
Danny.What's going on?
She ought to be careful.
That book's a load of bull.
- I bought it for her.
- Yeah?
Big mistake.
Anyone ask your opinion?
Danny.come on.man.
Just watch my back.okay?
Listen. pal.
Let me tell you a little something about cults.
What's going on?
You letting me go?
Hello.richard.
What's with the dopey grin?
Nothing.Just the way that you...
you bite on your tongue when you're trying to concentrate.
I've been doing that since I was a kid.
How long have you been in seattle?
Two years.
Left my mom and her new boyfriend
and came out here for the music.
Somehow.my life took a weird turn.
I've had a few of those myself.
What.you run away from home too?
Um...
sort of.
except I lucked out.I found a place to run to.
Otherwise--
you would have wound up like the rest of us rejects?
Something like that.
You're one of those 4400 guys.huh?
Can you make my eyes turn green?
What.you able to walk on water?
I like your eyes the way that they are.
and I can barely swim.
Come on.now.
What the hell is this?
Dewey...
I see you been keeping busy.
No.baby.
he's just some guy--
bought us some food and blankets.
Liv.who is this guy?
Shawn.you got to go.
I'd listen to her.
What are you doing?
Well.see.she does whatever I tell her to do.
Do you have a problem with that?
Yeah.
Yeah.I do.
Shawn.please.
You've done your good deed.Just...
just go home.okay?Please.
Come with me.
Come with me.
And then what?
What.you gonna rescue me?
I don't want to be saved.
Get the hell out of here.
Go.I mean it.
Go!
Hey.
You're not going back to that school.
not till that woman is gone.
But what about my other classes?
I've got homework.
Since when do you care about school?
You want me to wind up like you?
Hey.you watch your mouth.
I don't want to fall behind.
"Fall behind"?
With the grades you've been bringing home?
You been behind since your first report card.
What.you just going to sit there.
or are you going to talk to me?
'Cause I really think you owe me an explanation.
You know.those guys wanted to kill me.
and I turn around.
and my cousin's nowhere in sight.
I don't know what happened.
Yeah.I know what happened--you ran out on me.
It's a good thing that security guard was there.
The other time.I could blame it on the beer.
You drink too much.
you can black out.right?
But today.I didn't drink anything.
I'm blacking out.
losing chunks of time.
It's like they did something to my wiring.
They?
Kyle.who are you talking about?
The same ones who took shawn.
who put me in the coma.
They left me messed up inside.
Hey.man.you're scaring me.
How do you think I feel?
Brian.
Any news?
Yeah.I got ahold of the weldon authorities.
and richard's been released from custody.
Oh.thank god.
When?
about an hour ago.
Why hasn't he called?
You sure you don't want to call lily.
let her know you're all right?
Am I?
You're in no danger from me.richard.
All I want is to make you an offer.
If it's not to your liking.
you can walk out of here.
You'll never see me again.
How much did you pay those cops to call you instead of ntac to get my picture into their hands?
It's my money.richard.
Look.
you said I was free to go after I heard your offer.
If you got one for me.
make it.
I want you to come home.
you and your family.
to the 4400 center.
I don't think so.
you said you read my book.
which means you know why we were taken and what we're meant to do.
The future...
The future rests in our hands.richard.
You.me.lily-- we are the chosen ones.
Come on.jordan.
we both know this has nothing to do with me or lily.
This is all about isabelle.
Isabelle.
Well.that's a lovely name.
For once.
why don't you say what you really want--
to take her from us.control her.
Your daughter is the future.
I believed that then.I believe it now.
Then what's changed?
I have.
I'll need more than your word.
Of course.
Bring me to isabelle.
Let her judge me.
Isabelle's not coming anywhere near you.
What are you afraid of.richard?
I'm the one at risk.
I'm still suffering the after-effects of our last encounter.
Richard.it's simple.
If I'm lying.
if my motives are not pure.
isabelle will punish me accordingly.
and you'll be free of me once and for all.
But if I'm sincere.
if isabelle accepts me.
well.then.I can offer you and lily and the child a new life.
Stop running.richard.
Forget it.
It's not going to happen.
There's no way I'm going to allow isabelle anywhere near that man.
But think about it.
If collier really has changed.
it means we can get off the road.stop running.
That's a big if.
He offered to act as a middleman between us and ntac.
Says he can get them to back off.
And you believe him?
He's got lawyers.
a whole organization behind him.
We can barely even pay for gas.
He's lied to us before.
The man tried to destroy our relationship.
Okay.let's say he is lying.
Maybe all of this is some kind of trap...
to get his hands on our daughter.
He wants a face-to-face with isabelle?
I say we give it to him.
You've seen what she's capable of.
what she can do if she feels threatened.
It still feels like an awful big risk.
For collier.
Stand back.Let her through.
Get out of here!
Welcome back.heather.
I'm sorry about all of this.
Once the media loses interest.
things will die down.
Until it does.
we need to discuss how you intend to handle security.
Let me get heather situated.
then I'll meet you in my office.
- Come on.
- Don't get comfortable.freak! You're not staying!
I like this one with the smoke and the clouds--
Greg.
Does your father know you're here?
It's all your fault.
Everything was okay till you showed up.
Greg.
please put the gun down.
No.
You made me do this.
I have no choice.
Yes.you do.
but only if you put the gun away.
I can't be here anymore.My dad won't let me.
This is my last chance.
Greg.calm down--
no!
Not until you change me like you did them.
You have to!
there's nothing to discuss.
I'll take anything.
Violin.
painting.
photography.I don't care!
Listen.greg.
You're problem is with me.
not your classmates.
Let them go.
and you and i will deal with this alone.
Yeah.sure.
That works for me.
Okay.
I'd like you all to leave now.
quietly.don't run.
Ms.Tobey.will you be okay?
Move!
Go on.
For an entire week?
Is that really necessary?
To and from school.strictly as a precaution.
- A continued police presence will send a
clear message to anyone who feels they can--
- Okay.
so now we're alone.
Now.do whatyou promised!
would you put the gun down.
- No!
- greg?
Please.put the gun down.
It scares me.
Well.good.
It's supposed to scare you!
Greg...
D.A. Says we don't have a criminal case.
fine.We'll take it to civil court.
- One way or another--
- excuse us.
Hey.buddy.what's your problem?
You're needed inside.
I don't feel any different.
Greg.I'm trying.
Well.try harder.
You found it in mike.in rita...
you can find it in me!
I told you.
I told you she was dangerous.
None of you would listen.
She's not the one holding the gun.
Greg is a kid.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
She's got his mind all twisted.
I got news for you.
I knew everything I needed to know the first time I talked to greg.
You're the one who twisted his mind.
- You put that gun in his hand.
- That is not true.
We both know it's true...
and now you're the only one who's going to get your son out of this alive.
Good.
Whatever talents they have were there to begin with.
But we're only talking about a handful of students.
You found it in them.
You can find it in me.
You have to.
before I wind up like him--
you know.my dad.
Is that what you're afraid of?
- You were worried she was going to damage your son?
- You know what my dad's like.
He's nothing.
He's a big.angry nothing.
and that's exactly what he wants me to be.
and I can't let that happen.
Now.goddamn it.do something!
It's no good.is it?
There's nothing there.
I'm sorry.Greg.
not everybody's meant to be an artist or a musician.
You'll find a place.
Sure I will.
I have a talent for failure.just like him.
You don't have to become like your father.
Somewhere along the line.he made a choice.
You can make a different one.
a better one.
She's right.greg.
Dad?
The mistakes I made...
they're mine.
They're not yours.
Just because I failed.
it doesn't mean that you have to.
Please put down the gun.greg.
Don't-- don't let my mistakes get you killed.
Yo.shawn!
You got to do something.man.
He's knocking the crap out of her.
What are you talking about?
Dewey sold that guitar you got liv.
Now he's all cranked up.screaming and whatnot.
She needs you.
Come on.Come on
A liv?
I begged him.
Told him he was taking too much!
Dude's dying.
No!
No!
No!
Jesus...
what did you do?
He brought him back.
What the hell happened?
What happened?
This guy just saved your life.
Thank you.
My leg...
please fix it.
I'm sorry,it doesn't work like that.
Why not? You helped him.
I...
save us!
No, I can'T.
I can't help everyone.I'm sorry.
Have mercy on us.
I'm sorry.
I can't help everyone.
I can't help everyone.
I...
I can't help everyone!
No!They need you.
You sure about this?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Lily...
good to see you.
And this is isabelle.
Hi.
Yes.
Yes.
How's that?
Well, I guess that's it.
Good-bye fairview.
At least,this time,it's your call.
I'll find another town,
another school,
maybe work as a private tutor for a while.
I just have to figure out a way to use this gift of mine without causing so much pain.
Well, the world could always use a little more beauty.
I hope so.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You know,I was thinking of getting maia piano lessons.
Oh yeah?
I bet she'd like that.
Or maybe even study painting,
'cause she's always coloring.
I guess you could call that a ripple effect.
A positive one.
we are not a threat
we are salvation
the world will have to deal with us
Previously on the 4400...
you know those visions that maia used to have?
It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped.
How long have you known?
Not long.
I only found out because I read her diary.
You're one of those 4400 guys. huh?
One day.
all of this will be yours.
But you're not going anywhere.
Whatever you do. shawn.
don't reveal your healing ability.
because if you heal one of them.
you'll have to heal them all.
I'm blacking out.
If you're losing chunks of time.
you should talk to your dad about it.
What's he going to do.
turn me over to ntac medical?
Can I help you?
Heidi.it's mommy.
Who?
That's okay. sweetie. I got it.
She's my daughter.
She doesn't know that.
She thinks carol is her mother.
Brian. look. I need your help.
Richard. he's been arrested.
Okay. I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.
Hello. richard.
I want you to come home.
If I'm lying.
isabelle will punish me accordingly.
If isabelle accepts me.
well. then I can offer you and lily and the child a new life.
Let her judge me.
Hush-a-bye.
hush-a-bye
go to sleep little baby
when you wake I'll give you cake
and all the pretty little horses
and go to sleep-y little baby
who's a special girl?
Is isabelle a special girl? Is she?
Come here.
Look at him with isabelle.
This keeps up.
we're going to have to start calling him "uncle jordan.
" There's something so wrong about that.
Isn't there?
A week ago.
he was the one guy we were trying to keep away from her.
-and now it's like...
- they've bonded.
She's really taken to him.
Is that the couple of the hour?
Hi.
Richard. what's up. man?
It's good to see you.
Look at you. Oh.
you look great. You look great.
So how long do you guys think you're going to be staying?
We're not sure.
Collier said we could stay at the center till we get back on our feet.
Did he get you squared away with ntac?
Started to.
His lawyers took our statements.
I guess we're looking at back fines for not reporting in.
Well. hey.
I'm sure jordan will take care of it.
He offered to.
but I think we're going to try and swing it ourselves.
Well. hey. you picked the right week to come.
This reunion thing's going to be big. huh?
We've got 4400s coming in from 27 different countries.
Three more maybes.
There haven't been this many of us in the same place since quarantine.
What's happened since we left town?
I mean. suddenly it seems like
everyone's dying to meet a real. live 4400.
Yeah. well. what happened? Jordan happened.
Welcome to the revolution. little lady.Huh?
He's going to die! I saw it.
He's going to die.
Sweetheart. are you okay?
Did you have a nightmare?
No. I was awake. and I saw it.
Tell us what you saw.
That man we watched on tv once.
What man?
Him.
Jordan collier?
Someone's going to kill him.

As far as this department knew.
maia wasn't having visions anymore.
Right?
Well. she was keeping them secret from me
and writing everything down in a diary.
but I'm not here to talk about my daughter.
We're here to talk about collier.
We could talk about him all you want.
but if I was collier.
I'd be bringing all my books back to the library.
If you know what i'm mean.
The kid's never wrong. right?
Look. as far as I can tell.
maia has two kinds of visions.
If she can see an event clearly enough in her head.
she can sometimes influence the course of the future.
But mostly her visions are abstract.
They're more like...
certainties.
Prophecies.
I guess you could call them.
Now. this is one of those.
and as far as I can tell.
they're never wrong.
Well. not yet. anyway.
but nobody's made a concerted effort
to stop one of them from happening.
So we could always offer collier a suite in the basement.
24-hour surveillance. and a food taster.
Sure. we just tell the guy
he needs to stay isolated for what.
a week?
A year?
When it comes to the prevention of future crime.
there are no time limits-- and everyone's a suspect.
I mean. literally everyone.
So how to stop the inevitable from happening?
Stopping the inevitable--
isn't that what we deal with every day?
I mean. that's why the 4400 were sent back. right?
I like the "can-do" attitude.
but I have to ask--
do we even want to save collier?
Well. he is kind of the bad guy.
Maybe that's the way the future wants it.
Unless they gave us this message as a way to stop collier's death from happening.
Fascinating.
What an extraordinary gift.
You are clear on what we're telling you?
Your daughter
has quite a track record when it comes to seeing the future.
Her latest vision involves my death.
I leave anything out?
No. that about covers it.
Ntac is offering you all its resources.
That means round-the-clock protection.threat assessment
and I'm meant. of course. to isolate myself?
Well. that would be the safest move.
Let's say I'm willing to assume good faith on your part-- which.
given your exploitation of the 4400 to get to me.
is rather generous...
what. you think we made this up?
I'm not sure you're that creative.
but your plan does call for my total withdrawal from the public eye
and cancellation of a celebration of the public interest
in the 4400 that's been months in the planning.
Our history with each other is what it is.
but this is real.
and denial is not a luxury you can afford.
Thank you for the information.
I'll keep it in mind.
Maia is never wrong.
Whatever protection you can afford me.
I can afford myself.
Pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out.
The foreign returnees' stories are particularly inspirational.
Still come here every thursday. huh?
Thought I might get lucky.
Lily.
What are you doing here?
I'm back in seattle.
I just wanted to thank you for helping richard.
Just a couple of phone calls.
It was no big deal.
We were in a bad spot.
You did what you could. It meant a lot.
Well. you really didn't have to get me anything.
It's actually for heidi.
Her birthday's coming up.
Oh.lily...
it's just a cool little handbag.
You don't have to tell her it's from me.
I don't want to mess with your life. brian.
I'm just trying to say "thank you."
Okay.
You're looking well.lily.
I'm glad things are working out.
I can't talk to first keys today.
There's too much going on with this party.
But class starts in 10 minutes.
I can't do it. lucy.
You're just going to have to tell them to think of it as a study hall.
Um...this is outgoing. Thank you.
You guys come for the tour?
Could we talk to you outside?
Kind of a bad day.
It's pretty crazy around here.
Told you he'd blow us off.
What's up?
Oh. liv.
They were too embarrassed to come inside.
I can'T. I can'T.
But I saw what you can do.
We all did.
You can heal people.
Listen. it's not that simple.
I can't heal everyone.
I'm not asking you to heal everyone.
Just them.
You don't understand. It's like it drains me.
I can do it for maybe one. maybe.
One is better than none.
And who chooses that one. way? You? Me?
I can't heal the world. I'm sorry.
What'd I tell you?
Waste of time...
don't look at me like that.
Kyle?
Hey.you with us. buddy?
What?
I thought you were...
you know. elsewhere.
No. I'm right here with you.
was just thinking. Relax.
I haven't had one of those blackouts in a couple of days.
I'm hoping that's all done.
Yeah. I do too.
But I still think you should tell your dad about it and get yourself checked out.
You want to go with me to see the kills?
Okay.
so we're ignoring the whole blackout thing. or...
pretty much.
They go on at 8:00.
You should come.
The tsa is putting a flag on ian dravitt and his known associates.
They'll call us if anyone shows up in seattle.
This whole dravitt thing is just collier's latest deal gone south.
Collier had his name on the side of a skyscraper by the time he was 30.
You pursue power that ruthlessly.
you pick up some enemies along the way.
So we find the one who seems most like john hinckley or sirhan sirhan.
And then do what?
Follow him around for the rest of his natural life?
We could spend the next year looking at collier's moves since he founded the center.
The guy had a whole career before he got abducted.
Or maybe it is coming from someone who collier's never met.
I mean. if you hate the 4400.
killing their figurehead's a good way to make them suffer.
But what are we supposed to do?
The potential victim has refused our help.
No one said stopping the future was going to be easy.
Diana. look at this.
His name is miles quinlan.
Claims collier bankrupted him.
then kicked him out of the center.
Lives with his parents
What.
nursing a persecution complex?
Pretty much a poster boy for the lone gunman theory.
Come on. maia.
I've named every guy
I've dated for like the last five years.
Are you telling me I don't have a future with any of them?
I wouldn't worry about it.
Seems like you meet a lot of boys.
Yeah. well.that's the trouble.
I'm tired of meeting boys.
I want to meet a man.
You will.
When?
Aunt april.
just because I don't see it doesn't mean it's not going to happen.
Oh. that's probably mrs. Bradshaw from upstairs.
She's going to watch you tonight while I go to work.
I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.
You recognize me.
You're jordan collier.
I didn't mean to frighten her.
I just wanted to talk to her for a minute.
Yeah. well.
doesn't look like that's going to happen.
She believes I'm going to die.
Please give her my apologies.
I brought this for her.
I hope she doesn't already have one.
Thanks.
Hi. I'm lily tyler.
- I think someone was asking for me-
- excuse me.
Heidi...
are you my mother?
I heard them fighting about you.
My mom and dad... carol.
It's okay that I still call her "mom." right?
I know it's confusing. baby.
Just 'cause they're talking in the other room doesn't mean I can't hear them.
They said you were one of the 4400.
That's why I was gone.
That's why we don't know each other.
Didn't you come to our house once?
It's the first thing I did when I got back.
I wanted to see you.
But your dad and I.
we weren't sure it was a good idea.
Sweetie. does your father know you came down here?
No.
I didn't tell them I heard.
I didn't go to school today.
I came here instead.
I'm glad you did.
Was it hard for you not to see me?
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
I think about you every single day.
Look at this.
Is that me?
That was the day we brought you back from the hospital.
You look the same as you do now.
I was gone so long.but...
to me...
this feels like yesterday.
You want to talk about collier?
He uses people up and leaves them on the curb.
Is that why you left the center?
I didn't leave. They threw me out.
That's what happens when you run out of money.
They have all these different levels.
They call them keys. right?
You make seventh key. you're unlocked.
"Unlocked"-- meaning you've got your own 4400 ability?
Well. that's the big prize.
only they set it up so no one ever gets there.
There's mid-levels and side seminars you have to pass.
If you're not one of the 4400. each one costs.
First I ate up my savings.
then I cashed out the equity in my house.
And they didn't deliver.
Soon as the first check bounced.
they told me I'd reached maximum potential and sent me on my way.
Is that why you applied for a handgun permit?
We ran a vicap check on you this morning.
So I bought a gun. So what?
I need to protect myself from collier.
Yeah. well.
I hope self-defense is all you have in mind.
because if you're planning anything else.
we will be all over you the minute you approach the 4400 center.
You want something to be paranoid about? Think about that.
You're simplifying the issue.
Canceling the gala is no guarantee of my safety.
It's a start.
Jordan. you just told me there's a little girl out there
who can see the future and she saw you dead.
It's time to make yourself scarce.
And where does it stop?
Do I stay away from the center?
I cut myself off from our work?
Yeah. if it means staying alive.
I am not going to become a hermit.
That is not a win for us.
Look. the center is significantly safer than it seems.
Half the people you see in workmen's uniforms are bodyguards.
Are you looking to die in public?
You're developing a real flair for drama.
you know. This is hanging over my head.
not yours.
Look. I'm sorry. jordan.I'm just-
I am not ready to become a martyr.
And you don't have to be.
I know you've been looking forward to this weekend for a long time.
Bringing all the 4400 together.
it's like a validation for everything you've done so far.
But if something happens to you.
it could undo everything that we've started.
The movement's not ready for you to be a martyr.either.
Just
go. Go.
Where'd you go? I was about to have them page you.
Richard. there's someone I want to introduce to you.
This is my daughter.
heidi.
She came to the center to meet me. We've been talking.
Well.
it's very nice to meet you.
I'm richard tyler.I'm married to lily-
- your mother.
She told me.
It's nice to meet you. too.
Is that...
isabelle.
This is your half-sister.
Don't be scared.
I'm sorry.
She must be hungry.
It's okay.
I should probably get home anyway.
Well. I hope I can see you again.
I hope so. too.
Maybe next time I can hold isabelle.
I bet we could make that happen.
I'll walk you out.
No more cutting school. okay?
What's the matter?
All I'm saying is he was taller than I pictured him.
Well. tall or short.
collier had no business showing up here.
I totally agree. Di.
I didn't let him in.
Aunt april likes tall boys.
Oh. So you're talking about men to my daughter?
She's a child.
It might have come up in passing.
Hey. mom?
How come you never go out on dates?
Well. I wouldn't say never.
But aunt april Goes out all the time.
Well. I think your aunt's an extreme example.
How do I know which one is right?
Not many or lots?
I think that you should probably shoot for somewhere in the middle.
I'll try.
But do dates always have to be with boys?
They're so gross.
You get used to them.
Can we have this conversation. like in two or three.
maybe 10 years?
What's that?
Oh. A lady dropped it off today.
Oh It's a subpoena.
What's that?
Well. it's when someone wants you to give them something.
Who's it from?
It's from my bosses.
What do they want?
Your diary.
Kyle! You okay. man?
You didn't have a drink. did you?
Just diet coke.
It's really loud in there. huh?
Yeah. but they're great. huh?
You want to go back in?
Come on. My buddy's saving us a spot by the stage.
Do you know what time it is?
What are you doing here?
Kyle! Do you know what time it is?
What are you doing outside my apartment?
I don't know. I was at the pub.
You're scaring me.
How long have you been out here?
I don't know...
I think I was digging or something.
Look. kyle. I think you should go.
- We can talk about this-
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
It just happened again.
Let me in.
Get your hands off of me! You don't understand.
He's a fraud. All of you.
do you hear me?
Your golden boy is a big fraud.
Liv. you need to calm down.
It's okay. guys. I got it.
My whole life.
I have been looking for just one thing.
just one thing to believe in.
I thought it was you.
How long ago did you get high?
You gonna help me up. or what?
Are you going to stop yelling at me?
I am done with you altogether.
Go back to your penthouse.
Pretend we don't exist.
Everyone else does.
Why not you?
Listen...
easy.
I'm not going to sen d youoff into the night like this.
You can sleep on my couch.
I got you.
It's okay.
You started all this. you know.
Everything around you took shape after you showed me where to go.
I don't know what to do. though.
I could count the number of times I've said that on one hand.
but right now it's true.
That's right. If you know anything...
now would be a good time to tell uncle jordan. huh?
Oh...
thank you.
Thank you.
The reunion goes forward.
Diana. One of dravitt's hired guns flew into town last night.
His name is laurent ganning.
Tsa had his alias flagged.
Well. do we have a present whereabouts?
He just checked into a motel in first hill under the name "lawrence gawain"
It's clear.
Tom...
he's on the move.
Wendy. wait. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
You were waiting in the hallway outside my apartment last night.
Do you know how weird that is?
I don't know how I got there. Please. believe me.I-I-
I had another blackout last night.
Look. kyle. this is getting bad.
and I can't give you tHe kind of help that you need.
So you want me to just go away?
No. I...
I want you to talk to someone.
someone qualified.
I'm scared for you.
Scared for me or scared of me?
And we are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests.
many of whom risked so much to be here today...
you know. glen.
I'm getting some nasty echos.
Can we adjust the levels on the speakers in the back?
Testing. testing. one. two.three.Testing.
You know. that's a lot better.
Nobody moves!
Everyone stay right where you are.
Don't move. Don't move!
Get your hands on your head.
Get them up. Turn around. Turn around!
Get down. down. Down!
Ganning's pistol was made from synthetic polymers.
The bullets. too.
He walked it right through your metal
detectors without so much as a peep.
You were Round to get him.
He never would have killed me.
He was standing two feet away from you with a loaded firearm.
The whole thing was put in motion by maia.
Your daughter's vision was a gift to me.
a prescription. if you will.
for changing the future.
In one chain of events.
ganning's bullet killed me.
I can only assume that somebody has a different plan for me.
Well. I wouldn't be putting my feet up by the fire just yet.
I have no intention of canceling the extra security measures.
The same extra measures that just allowed an assassin to walk right up to you.
Would ntac like a presence at the gala tomorrow?
Yes.
Mr. Collier. we don't stand off to the side and watch.
We take command.
I'll issue credentials.
That was a rather dramatic demonstration of competence just now.
What time is it?
It's about 2:00.
How'd I end up here. anyway?
Liv. you were pretty far gone last night.
but are you really telling me you don't remember?
I remember.
You don't have to hover over me.
I'm not going to steal anything.
The maid can come in and clean the couch as soon as I'm gone.
How many of these nights do you think you have left in you?
Hopefully not too many.
You've seen my life.
When I O.D..
It's not gonna be any big loss.
That is not true.
How's it going to change?
I used to feel the same way.
I meant what I told you.
I can't save the whole world.
and I can't even save your friends.
and I'm sorry.
but if you're serious about wanting a change.
maybe I can save you.
How?
By giving you the same thing that saved me.
He's here.
hi.Good to see you.
Excuse me.
Hello. my love.
Here we go.
I think I have to...
nice to meet you
Pleasure to see you.
Excuse me. sir.
All the guestscheck out so far.
Yeah. we secured the surrounding rooftops.
did a bomb sweep.
So now it's cross-our-fingers time.
Yeah.
Good afternoon.
Thank you for coming to the center.
We have a great day planned for you.
but before we get started.
I'd like to thank the man that made this all possible.
I mean that literally-- he didn't just pay for the food.
He built this place.
and this movement.
so I'd like you to please welcome my mentor.
my friend-- mr. Jordan collier.
Thank you.
and thank you. shawn.
for that introduction.
We are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests.
many of whom risked so much to be here today.
Let's go.
I just want to hear what the man has to say for himself.
Jordan?
He's up there! Go!
Everybody stay down!
we've got a shooter.
Everyone calm down! Just stay down. Stay down!
We've got a shooter.
Let me go.
Jordan! Oh. my god!
Oh.god...
please let me go. please!
get that stretcher ready.
Pulse is weak and thready come on let's go harry up!
Breathing's stopped.
We're losing him again.
No! You're not going anywhere yet.
shawn! She told me to go through with it.
Who did?
She lies.
No....
don't go anywhereno.....
-Lily.I need to-
- brian. I don't have much time.
I did not violate our agreement.
Heidi found me.
Lily.
heidi's sick.
She's in the hospital.
It happened yesterday.
Something with her spleen.
They had to operate right away.
Is she okay?
Can I see her?
She's okay.
She's still recovering from the anesthesia.
She's been asking for you.
She's still in recovery now.
but carol thinks it's all right if you want to get in there tomorrow.
Brian. what happened?
Her spleen? She's 12 years old.
It just ruptured.
Her doctors said they've never seen anything like it.
Even they can't tell us why.
Where you been?
The funeral's about to start.
Lily. what's wrong?
What is it?
Heidi's sick.
and I think isabelle's responsible.
I think they're ready for you.
You are going to read a lot about jordan collier in the next few weeks.
some of it good.
a lot of it bad...
I will be ignoring all of it.
just like jordan would have.
because jordan may have used the media.
but he never allowed himself to be seduced by it.
I could tell you how much I owe the man.
He took me in when I was feeling lost and alone. confused.
I'm sure many of you have similar stories.
The fact is that everyone alive today.
whether they know it or not.
owes jordan collier.
He had a vision to save the future.
and he gave us that vision.
and now he won't be here to see us achieve it...
but we will achieve it.
I promise you.
we will achieve it.
We have all suffered a tremendous loss.
We are heartbroken and bleeding on the inside.
but we will not let that stop us.
and I will not let that stop me.
We will honor jordan collier.
and we will create the better future that he died building.
Thank you for coming.
Goodbye.
Nice words. shawn.
I think collier would have approved.
Yeah. I hope so.
He would have liked that you came.
Oh. I don't think I was that high on his radar.
Don't be too sure.
You guys bumped heads.
but you believed the same thing.
that the 4400 are the key to the future.
Your goals were identical.
But our methods were different.
Not as different as you think.
See. that's where your view of jordan collier splits from mine.
Well. at least we have some common ground.
Maybe your side and my side can work together now that I'm assuming new duties around here.
You're becoming quite the little politician. shawn.
Now I know collier would have been proud of you.
He's gone.
is body.
it's not there.
Someone stole the body.
There's only one way out.
and we were standing right in front of it.
Stole it how?
Then what happened?
All lying across the ground
try not to make no sound
to make or break you down I said
to make or break you down I break
all lying across the ground try not to make no sound
to make or break you down I said
to make or break you down I break
I take down what I need
'cause you know I need to breathe
I'm tired of walking on another plane
another plane 'cause I feel insane
I step back to get to you
cut back I'm falling through
another day I feel the same
I'm cutting and I'm bleeding here with you
WE'RE NOT A THREAT.
WE'RE SALVATION.
THE WORLD
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US.
I'M NOT YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
ANYMORE.
THEN STOP ACTING
LIKE A TWO-YEAR-OLD.
YOU'RE MY BROTHER.
SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
YOU GODDAMN FREAK!
DANNY,STOP IT!
STOP BLAMING ME FOR NIKKI!
DIANA SKOURIS,
YOUR ADOPTION OF MAIA RUTLEDGE
IS HEREBY COMPLETE.
HE'S GONNA DIE.
I SAW IT. HE'S GONNA DIE.
JORDAN COLLIER?
SOMEONE'S GOING TO KILL HIM.
NO!
NO!
HIS BODY,
IT'S NOT THERE!
THIS IS
YOUR NEW HOUSE?
IT'S YOURS TOO.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS MOMENT FOR TOO LONG.
ONLY ONE THING
MISSING--
MOM.
WE REALLY TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK.
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY
OF COLLEGE?
I DIDN'T HAVE ONE.
NOBODY PAID
MY TUITION.
I'M SORRY,KYLE.
I MUST HAVE FORGOT.
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS.
HOW COULD YOU FORGET?
YOU SPENT THREE YEARS
IN A COMA.
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS
DRINKING ANYTHING!
YOU TOLD ME EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT,RIGHT?
YEAH.
ANY COFFEE LEFT?
HELP YOURSELF.
COULDN'T FIND A CLEAN T-SHIRT?
THIS IS WHAT I WEAR
TO SCHOOL.
I LIKE IT.
YOU'RE LOOKING SHARP.
THANKS.
SO...
HOW YOU DOING,DAD?

FINE. WHY?
NO REASON.
JUST,UH...
YOU KNOW,GOOD LUCK.
OKAY?
I'LL BE THINKING
ABOUT YOU.
I'LL CALL YOU.

WHAT'S ALL THIS?
WELCOME BACK.
THE PRODIGAL SON
RETURNS.
RETURNS FROM WHERE?
GET YOUR GEAR ON.
WE GOT TO ROLL.
TOM,I AM SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU.
YEAH,YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE.
AS SOON AS WE TAKE
DOHERTY DOWN,
WE'RE GOING TO
POP THE CHAMPAGNE.
DOHERTY?
WHO'S DOHERTY?
DIANA,STOP.
FILL ME IN HERE.
WHO'S DOHERTY?
DOES HE HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH COLLIER'S MURDER?
WHAT,GOVERNOR COLLIER?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE'S NOT DEAD.
THIS WAS
GARRITY'S IDEA,RIGHT?
GOT TO ADMIT,
IT'S CREATIVE,
BUT "SCREW WITH
TOM BALDWIN DAY"IS OVER.
HEY,LISTEN,TOM,
DON'T DO THIS.
THE DOCTORS GAVE YOU
A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.
DOCTORS?
WHAT DOCTORS?
WHERE IS EVERYBODY HEADED?
AND WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
AROUND HERE TODAY?
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY JUST STAY HERE.
WE'LL TALK
WHEN I GET BACK.
DIANA,JUST--
SO,THIS GUY,DOHERTY,
IS HE A 4400?
WHAT'S A 4400?
PLEASE,STOP THIS.
FOUR THOUSAND,FOUR HUNDRED
MISSING PEOPLE...
THE FUTURE SENT THEM BACK
IN A BALL OF LIGHT.
ANY OF THIS
SOUND FAMILIAR?
DIANA,
I'M NOT LAUGHING,
SO WHATEVER GAME
YOU'RE PLAYING,
STOP IT,AND STOP IT RIGHT NOW.
TOM,WHATEVER
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS,
I CAN'T EVEN
IMAGINE IT,
AND EVERYONE HERE IS PULLING
FOR YOUR RECOVERY,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.
YOU SOUND DELUSIONAL.
THE FUTURE?
I MEAN,I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF THE 4400,
AND I CAN PROMISE YOU
THAT NOBODY EVER CAME BACK
IN A BALL OF LIGHT.
TELL ME ONE THING.
ACCORDING TO YOU,
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING
FOR THE LAST YEAR?
YOU'RE SERIOUS.
HUMOR ME.
IT'S YOUR CASE,
TOM.
DIRTY BOMBS,
REMEMBER?
YOU WENT UNDERCOVER
AND INFILTRATED
AN AUM SHINRIKYO TERROR CELL.
NONE OF THIS MEANS ANYTHING
TO YOU,DOES IT?
OF COURSE NOT.
WHY SHOULD IT?
WELL,YOUR COVER
WAS COMPROMISED.
THEY HELD YOU
FOR THREE WEEKS.
SLEEP DEPRIVATION,
TORTURE--
THEY'D HAVE KILLED YOU
IF YOU DIDN'T ESCAPE.
SO HOW DOES DOHERTY
FIT IN?
AUM SHINRIKYO'S BEEN PLANNING
AN ATTACK ON THE U.S.
SINCE THEY'VE BEEN SNEAKING
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL
INTO THE COUNTRY
IN MUSEUM POUCHES.
DOHERTY'S THE CURATOR.
HE'S BEEN IN BED WITH THEM
ALL ALONG.
TOM,HE SOLD YOU OUT.
YOU SPENT THREE WEEKS IN HELL
'CAUSE OF THIS GUY.
YOU'VE BEEN
ON MEDICAL LEAVE
FOR TWO MONTHS,
RECOVERING,AND...
OBVIOUSLY,
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THREE.
JORDAN COLLIER
MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART.
TELL ME YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS PLACE.
I RECOGNIZE IT,ALL RIGHT...
WELL,THAT'S A START.
BUT EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT.
THIS IS THE SPOT.
THIS IS WHERE COLLIER GOT SHOT.
DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T LET ANYONE ELSE
HEAR YOU SAY THAT.
TOM?
TOM!
IS HE IN THERE?
YEAH,I THINK SO.
YOU WANT TO DO
THE HONORS?
DID YOU FIND
ANYTHING?
SOMEBODY'S BEEN MESSING
WITH MY COMPUTER.
ALL MY CASE FILES ARE GONE.
I TYPE "4400"
INTO A SEARCH ENGINE,AND...
NOTHING.
HOW COULD THERE NOT BE
A SINGLE MENTION OF THEM?
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE BECAUSE...
NONE OF IT EVER HAPPENED?
SOMETHING HAS OBVIOUSLY
CHANGED.
THIS IS NOT THE SAME WORLD
THAT IT WAS YESTERDAY.
BUT I'M STILL TOM BALDWIN,
AND YOU'RE STILL DIANA SKOURIS,
WHICH MEANS THAT THE PEOPLE
THEY TOOK,
THEY EXIST TOO,RIGHT?
GARY NAVARRO.
WE WORKED WITH HIM LAST MONTH.
HE COULD READ THOUGHTS.
READ THOUGHTS?
TOM,COME ON.
PLAYED FOR CINCINNATI?
LIFETIME .317 BATTING AVERAGE.
ISN'T IT .300
WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PITCHER'S THINKING?
BUT...HE WAS NEVER TAKEN!
RICHARD TYLER.
WHAT DID HE HAVE?
HEAT VISION?
NO,SOME OF THEM
CAN DO...THINGS.
SOME OF THEM...
SOME OF THEM CAN'T.
HE'S DEAD.
HE'S PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN
OVER SINANJU IN 1951.
SO THAT'S TWO DOWN.
ARE WE GOING TO GO THROUGH
ALL 4,398 MORE?
I'LL TAKE MY BOOTS OFF
IF WE ARE.
DIANA,YOUR DAUGHTER.
YOUR DAUGHTER!
YOUR DAUGHTER,MAIA RUTLEDGE.
YOU ADOPTED HER,
RIGHT?
SHE'S ONE OF THEM.
TOM,DON'T INCLUDE ME
IN YOUR FANTASY LIFE.
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE
A DAUGHTER.
YES! RIGHT HERE.
IT'S A SEATTLE ADDRESS
FOR MAIA RUTLEDGE.
IT'S RIGHT HERE.
RIGHT HERE.
OH,THANK GOD.
MAIA,IT'S ME.
IT'S ME,TOM.
TOM BALDWIN.
I DON'T KNOW YOU.
DON'T SAY THAT,PLEASE.

MAIA'S MY GRANDMOTHER.
ELLA,WHO IS IT?
OH,HERE SHE IS.
THIS IS MY GRANDMOTHER.
YOU'RE MAIA RUTLEDGE?

DIDN'T EXPECT YOU HOME
SO SOON.
HOW'D YOU DO OUT THERE
TODAY?
GLAD TO SEE YOU,TOO.
EVERYTHING OKAY?
JUST TELL ME ONE THING.
YOU WERE IN A COMA
FOR THREE YEARS,RIGHT?
IF I HAVE ONE MORE OF THESE,
I COULD WIND UP IN A COMA
RIGHT NOW.
COME ON.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.
COME ON.
UNCLE TOMMY.
WE CAN EAT,FINALLY.
HOW YOU DOING?
SHAWN,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WELL,THE BAND

WE'RE NOT GOING TO START
RECORDING UNTIL TUESDAY.
BESIDES,I COULDN'T MISS
YOUR BIG DAY.
OR DANNY'S.
COME ON,TELL THEM.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
SHE ACTUALLY SAID "YES."
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
LOOK,HE BOUGHT ME THIS!
OH,I TOLD HIM
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT ONE
TILL HE WAS
OUT OF LAW SCHOOL.
I LIKE THAT.
YOU LIKE THAT?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,MR. BALDWIN?
DAD,DO YOU
NEED TO SIT?
IT CAN'T BE A JOKE.
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE
IN ON IT.
SIT DOWN.
SO THEN EITHER
I'M CRACKING UP,
OR THE WORLD IS.
DAD,THE DOCTORS SAID
YOU WERE OKAY.
I DON'T WANT TO SCARE YOU,
BUT SOMETHING'S WRONG.
I DON'T RECOGNIZE
THIS PLACE.
I MEAN,
I SORT OF DO,
BUT EVERYTHING'S
BEEN TWEAKED.
DAD,DAD,
LOOK AT ME.
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE.
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?
YOU GUYS STARTED
WITHOUT US?
JUST AS WELL.
AIRPORT TRAFFIC WAS INSANE.
HI,GUYS,NIKKI.
CAN YOU BELIEVE MY KID,
MY YOUNGEST KID,
IS GETTING MARRIED?
WHEN THE HELL
DID WE GET SO OLD?
SO YOU'RE BACK IN THE SADDLE.
HOW'D IT GO?
I DON'T THINK IT WENT TOO GOOD.
REALLY? I WAS JUST
TELLING YOUR WIFE
THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO BE FINE.
MY WIFE?
I'M STILL MARRIED TO LINDA?
I SAID WIFE,
NOT EX-WIFE.
ALANA,OVER HERE.
COME HERE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS WOMAN
BEFORE.
I THINK WE NEED TO BE ALONE...
GO UPSTAIRS. TALK.
NO. I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
DAD,ALANA'S
YOUR WIFE.
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED TO HER
FOR TWO YEARS.
SHE LIVES HERE,DAD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF YOU ARE
TALKING ABOUT,BUT IT'S OVER.
IT'S OVER,
IT'S OVER.
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?
GUYS DOWNSTAIRS CALLED.
THEY SAID YOU'VE BEEN
HERE FOUR HOURS.
YEAH.
SAD,ISN'T IT?
THE ONLY PLACE
I FEEL NORMAL
IS HIDING
IN A STORAGE CLOSET.
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT MUST
FEEL LIKE TO BE INSANE--
YOU'RE NOT INSANE,TOM.
YOU JUST NEED A REST.
EVERYONE KEEPS TELLING ME
I WAS TORTURED.
MAYBE THEY BROKE MY MIND.
YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK
FROM THIS,TOM.
IT'S JUST GOING
TO TAKE SOME TIME.
AND I'M GOING TO HELP YOU,
I PROMISE.
SO TELL ME AGAIN
ABOUT THIS BALL OF LIGHT.
WHEN DID YOU FIRST COME
TO BELIEVE IT HAPPENED?
AUGUST 14th,2004.
THAT'S WHEN THEY CAME BACK.
MAYBE NOT IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW,
BUT IT HAPPENED IN MINE--
GET HER OUT OF HERE!
NO ONE'S PLOTTING AGAINST YOU,
TOM.
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO
TO GET YOU BETTER.
HIS WIFE'S HERE.
SHE'S ASKING TO SEE HIM.
I AM NOT MARRIED.
I AM NOT MARRIED...
LOOK,LADY,I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.
YOU HAVE TO
PLAY ALONG.
I NEED YOU TO
GET OUT OF HERE
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
NONE OF THIS IS REAL
TO ME,EITHER.
I KNOW WE'RE
NOT MARRIED.
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
BEFORE YESTERDAY.
THE THINGS YOU TALK ABOUT--
THE BALL OF LIGHT,
THE 4400...
YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 4400?
KNOW OF THEM?
I AM A 4400.
OW MY BEHAVIOR
WAS TOTALLY OUT OF LINE,
AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.
I GOT FIXATED
ON GETTING BACK TO WORK,
AND OBVIOUSLY,
THE STRAIN,THE,UH...
THE EXCITEMENT,
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.
WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND
YOUR MEDICAL LEAVE
BY ANOTHER
SIX WEEKS,
AND THEN WE WILL SEE ABOUT
GETTING YOU BACK OUT IN THE FIELD.
I'LL CIRCLE THE DATE.
OKAY.
SO I CAN GO NOW?
YOUR PSYCH HOLD IS OVER.
GREAT.
I'M...
I'M SORRY FOR THE AMBUSH.
DESPERATE TIMES,
DESPERATE MEASURES.
I'LL SEE YOU
IN SIX WEEKS.
TOM BALDWIN.
ALANA MAREVA.
SO I GUESS WE'RE MARRIED.
SO I'M TOLD.
LET'S GO HOME.
SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.
-WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE?
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE WE CROSSED INTO
SOME KIND OF...
ALTERNATE REALITY,
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION.
I KNOW.
IT SOUNDS INSANE.
IT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE.
IMPOSSIBLE
ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE,AND...
YOU'RE A 4400.
YOU THINK I'M DOING THIS?
IT'S AN EXPLANATION.
A PRETTY SIMPLE ONE,ACTUALLY.
SIMPLE,BUT WRONG.
IF I WERE MAKING THIS UP,
WHY WOULD I PUT MYSELF
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR LIFE?
I'M SORRY.THIS CAN'T
BE EASY FOR YOU,EITHER.
YEAH,EASY.
MY FRIENDS,MY FAMILY,
EVERYTHING I KNOW IS GONE.
ERASED.
I'M TRAPPED
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR LIFE.
HOW DO I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU
MAKING THIS UP?
ERASED?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN ERASED?
I USED TO OWN
THIS PLACE.
I BOUGHT IT
FOUR YEARS AGO,
A FEW MONTHS
BEFORE I WAS ABDUCTED.
AND NONE OF THIS
LOOKS FAMILIAR NOW?
I WAS MY OWN BUYER.
I FLEW ALL OVER THE WORLD
AND BOUGHT
MOSTLY SCULPTURES,
PRIMITIVE ART.
EXCUSE ME.
CAN I TALK TO THE OWNER?
HE'S NOT HERE TODAY.
ANY IDEA
WHEN HE OPENED THIS PLACE?
A LONG TIME AGO.
15,MAYBE 20 YEARS.
IT ONLY GETS WORSE.
YOU'RE SURE
THAT'S THE RIGHT BENCH?
I USED TO COME HERE
EVERY WEEK.
BELIEVE ME,I KNOW WHICH BENCH
I DEDICATED
TO MY HUSBAND AND SON.
SO BACK IN THE WORLD
WE CAME FROM...
THEY DIED...
IN A CAR ACCIDENT...
SHORTLY BEFORE I WAS ABDUCTED.
THERE'S A WAY BACK HOME.
WE'RE GOING TO FIND IT.
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.
WHAT,YOU'RE SLEEPING
IN THE GUEST ROOM?
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
YEAH.
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
WE HAVE TO PLAY ALONG.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HAPPILY MARRIED.
WE DON'T WANT YOUR SON
ASKING QUESTIONS.
OKAY,I'LL,UH,FIND A SPOT
ON THE FLOOR.
ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T BE
MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE BATHTUB?
I'M KIDDING,THOMAS.
IT'S A BIG BED.
I'M SURE WE CAN KEEP
IN OUR OWN SECTORS.
DO YOU THINK
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES?
ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE
LIKE US,
WONDERING HOW
THEY GOT HERE?
IF THERE ARE,WE'LL FIND THEM.
WE'LL TAKE OUT
CLASSIFIED ADS
IN EVERY MAJOR
CITY PAPER.
"REMEMBER THE 4400s?
DROP US A LINE."
WE'LL CHECK OUT EVERY RETURNEE
WE CAN FIND.
TELL ME
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
FAVORITE RECORDS?
WHERE I WENT TO SCHOOL?
HOW ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND AND SON?
WHAT WERE THEY LIKE?
PAUL WAS A RADIOLOGIST.
WE MET WHILE HE WAS ON VACATION
IN TAHITI.
THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM.
LINDA AND I THOUGHT ABOUT
GOING THERE FOR OUR HONEYMOON.
WE PICKED HAITI INSTEAD.
TWO YEARS LATER,
AFTER WE WERE MARRIED,
WE HAD BILLY.
HE WAS SO QUIET AND SWEET.
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
I THINK THIS WAS
THE INTERVIEW
WHERE I SAID I WANTED
TO GO INTO MEDICINE
BECAUSE NURSES
ARE SEXY.
YOU DID NOT
SAY THAT.
I GOT INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL!
STANFORD,BABY!
CONGRATULATIONS.
THE REAL KYLE USED TO TALK
ABOUT BEING A DOCTOR ALL THE TIME.
RIGHT UP
UNTIL HE WENT INTO A COMA.
"THE REAL KYLE..."
I KNOW
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY YOUR SON,
BUT HE SEEMS PRETTY REAL TO ME.
HE GETS HAPPY
WHEN HE HEARS GOOD NEWS,
CRANKY WHEN HE GETS TIRED,
AND HE FORGETS TO PUT
THE TOILET SEAT DOWN.
HE'S A GOOD KID.
HE WAS RAISED WELL.
I GOT A RESPONSE
FROM OUR AD IN THE POST.
PHILIP KENDRICK.
HE WANTS TO MEET US.
PHILIP KENDRICK?
TOM BALDWIN.
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT THE 4400?
IT WAS THE BEST SEDAN
CITROEN EVER PUT OUT.
HYDRAULICS CAME STANDARD
ON EVERY MODEL--
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A CAR?
YEAH!
MINE'S PARKED OUTSIDE.
WHERE'S YOURS?
IT'S IN THE SHOP.
I'LL SEND YOU A PICTURE.
UH,TOM,
I DON'T HAVE YOUR ADDRESS.
WELL,THAT WAS
PRODUCTIVE.
YEAH...
SHOULD WE CHECK OUT
THE BLAKE EXHIBIT
WHILE WE'RE HERE?
UH...YEAH,
WHY DON'T YOU...
WHY DON'T YOU
GO AHEAD?
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.
NO,IT'S...
THOMAS...
THOMAS...
THOMAS?
THOMAS!
IT'S GONE.
WHAT'S GONE?
THAT DOOR. IT WAS BACK.
AND I OPENED IT THIS TIME.
IT WAS SOME KIND OF
OPERATING ROOM,I THINK.
I DIDN'T SEE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
YOU WERE JUST STANDING
THERE LIKE A STATUE.
THAT ROOM'S THE ANSWER.
IT HAS TO BE.
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT DOESN'T FIT.
IT'S NOT PART
OF THIS REALITY.
IF IT EVEN EXISTS.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SEE IT--
I HAVE TO GET BACK THERE.
HEY,PARTNER.
BLACK,TWO SUGARS.
SO THE GUARDS TELL ME
THAT YOU SPENT...
FIVE HOURS HERE YESTERDAY,
THREE THE DAY BEFORE THAT,
AND,ONE SATURDAY,
YOU LOGGED UP 12.
YEAH,SO I LIKE ART.
IT'S A NICE,
FUNCTIONAL DOOR,TOM,
BUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT
A WORK OF ART.
NOW,MAYBE IF IT WERE MADE
OF BLACK OBSIDIAN...
I READ YOUR PSYCH FILE.
YOU PLANNING ON HAVING ME
LOCKED UP AGAIN,DIANA?
YOU KNOW,THIS OTHER REALITY
THAT YOU'RE ANXIOUS
TO GET BACK TO?
I MEAN,EVEN IF YOU COULD
GET BACK TO IT,
IT DOESN'T SOUND
THAT GREAT,TOM.
BACK THERE,
YOU WERE DIVORCED.
HERE,YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL WIFE.
BACK THERE,
YOU SON,KYLE,
SPENT FOUR YEARS
IN A COMA.
HERE,HE'S ABOUT TO SPEND
FOUR IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.
BACK THERE,YOUR SISTER'S FAMILY
IS COMPLETELY DYSFUNCTIONAL,
YOUR NEPHEW IS IN A CULT,
AND THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD
IS IN JEOPARDY.
YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO...BLEAK.
IT'S JUST A...
JUST LIFE.
THIS IS LIFE,
AND IT'S A BETTER LIFE FOR YOU
AND FOR EVERYONE YOU CARE ABOUT.
JUST ACCEPT
WHAT YOU HAVE.
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
WELL,YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
JUST SITTING IN THIS HALLWAY.
ALANA?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
HAVE YOU SEEN
THESE PICTURES?
LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS
WE'VE DONE TOGETHER.
YOU KNOW,YOU'D THINK
IF WE'RE TRAPPED HERE,
THEY WOULD GIVE US
THESE MEMORIES.
YOU KNOW?
LOOK,WE'VE BEEN
TO CHINA.
I'VE WANTED TO GO
MY ENTIRE LIFE TO CHINA.
LOOK,ALANA,I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE
FOR US TO GET OUT OF HERE.
I DON'T KNOW.
WHO SAYS WE WILL?
YOU KEEP TALKING
ABOUT THAT DOOR.
IT'S BEEN A MONTH ALREADY.
WHAT IF
IT NEVER COMES BACK?
THEN WE'RE TRAPPED,OKAY,
THEN WE'RE TRAPPED.
I DON'T...
BUT IF WE ARE,
ALANA,
I PROMISE YOU,
WE WILL MAKE NEW MEMORIES.
JUST AS GOOD AS THESE.
BETTER.
OH,I BELIEVE WE COULD,THOMAS.
I LIKE IT
WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT.
"THOMAS."
AND THIS GOES UP,AND THEN...
UGH,I CAN NEVER GET
THESE THINGS RIGHT.
LET ME TAKE A SHOT.
COME HERE. HOLD STILL.
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
TO MAKE BIG LOOPS.
LEAVE YOURSELF
A LITTLE ROOM TO WORK WITH.
HANDS
OF A SURGEON.
HANDS OF A RESIDENT,
MORE LIKE.
NO,YOU'LL GET THERE.
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE IT
OVER AT ST. BEDE'S?
THE HOURS ARE KILLER.
DOCTORS TREAT ME LIKE
A GLORIFIED CANDYSTRIPER.
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
IS A DISTANT MEMORY.
I LOVE IT.
WELL,I LOOK
LIKE I BELONG
ON TOP
OF A WEDDING CAKE.
HEY,YOU BROUGHT THIS
ON YOURSELF.
SOME PEOPLE GO TO FIJI
FOR THEIR 10th ANNIVERSARY.
YOU TWO WANTED
TO RENEW YOUR VOWS.
YEAH,WELL,
THE FIRST TIME
JUST FELT LIKE
PICTURES IN A BOOK.
THIS ONE...
THIS ONE IS FOR ME AND ALANA.
READY TO GO,CHAMP?
AND DO YOU,
ALANA BALDWIN,
ALSO RENEW YOUR
COMMITMENTS TO HONOR,OBEY,
AND LOVE
YOUR HUSBAND,THOMAS,
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?
I DO.
THEN BY THE POWER
VESTED IN ME,
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
STILL MAN AND WIFE.
GO AHEAD.YOU MAY KISS
YOUR BEAUTIFUL BRIDE.
I'M GETTING IN HERE.
OH,I LOVE YOU GUYS.
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL,
MRS. BALDWIN?
MARRIED. FINALLY.
FEELS REAL NOW,HUH?
WELL,IT FELT REAL
FOR A LONG TIME.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
WE RESISTED IT.
DO YOU MISS IT?
YOUR OLD LIFE?
I STILL THINK ABOUT IT,
BUT AFTER
ALL THESE YEARS,
THAT LIFE,THAT WORLD--
THAT FEELS
LIKE THE DELUSION.
I KNOW.
I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE
TO EVEN REMEMBER
A LIFE WITHOUT YOU.
SEE,I'M GOOD THAT WAY.
LIKE A CELLPHONE
OR TIVO.
ONCE YOU'VE GOT ME,
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
NOT HAVING ME.
I LOVE YOU,THOMAS.
IT STILL KILLS ME
WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT.
COME HERE,WOMAN.
YOU'RE RESIGNING?
I'M MOVING ON,TOM.
I'VE BEEN HERE
11 YEARS.
THE PRIVATE SECTOR BECKONS.
DENNIS RYLAND
OFFERED ME
A PARTNERSHIP
IN HIS CONSULTING FIRM.
NICE GIG.
SO YOU'RE MOVING TO VIRGINIA?
THREE WEEKS.
LOOK,D.C. HAS ASKED ME
TO SUBMIT A LIST OF NAMES
AS POTENTIAL REPLACEMENTS.
I'M GIVING THEM ONE.
YOURS.
WELL,I'M-- I'M FLATTERED.
I,UH...
BUT YOU MIGHT NEED
A BACKUP OR TWO.
I MEAN,
SOMEWHERE IN MY PERSONNEL FILE
ARE MEASUREMENTS
FOR MY STRAITJACKET.
NAH,YOU WERE
CONVALESCING
FROM INJURIES
RECEIVED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
YOUR SERVICE IN THAT CASE
WAS HEROIC.
I THINK YOU CAN TALK YOUR
WAY AROUND THE FALLOUT.
THAT IS,IF YOU WANT THE JOB.
A CHANCE TO SIT
IN THE BIG CHAIR?
I WANT IT,ALL RIGHT.
GOOD.
THEN PRACTICE SAYING,
"NICE TO MEET YOU TOO,SENATOR."
BEST WAY TO PREP FOR
YOUR CONFIRMATION HEARING.
I'LL SPRING
FOR A NEW SUIT.
MY LAST ACT
AS HEAD OF THIS DIVISION
WILL BE TO MAKE SURE
THAT THIS HAPPENS.
CONGRATULATIONS,TOM.
YOU'VE EARNED THIS.
THANK YOU.
GUESS WHAT.
DON'T TELL ME.
YOU JUST SPOKE TO JARVIS.
YOU KNEW?
SHE MIGHT HAVE
MENTIONED SOMETHING.
AND YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME?
I'M TRANSFERRING YOU
TO GREENLAND.
OH,LOOK,
HE'S NOT EVEN CONFIRMED YET,
AND HE'S MAD WITH POWER.
BALDWIN.
HEY,YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.
THEY'VE JUST ASKED ME
TO JOIN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
AT THE COLLIER MUSEUM.
WOW. THAT'S...QUITE AN HONOR.
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD TAKE IT?
THE BEST MUSEUM
ON THE WEST COAST.
YOU GOT TO TAKE IT.
THERE'S A BENEFIT
AT THE SEATTLE INNER CITY
ARTS COUNCIL ON FRIDAY NIGHT.
THEY WANT
TO INTRODUCE ME AROUND.
I DIDN'T PUT MY TUX
BACK INTO STORAGE.
SO IT,UM...
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH GOT A LITTLE
SURPRISE AT THE OFFICE TODAY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?
JUST TELL ME,THOMAS.
HONEY,I'LL SEE YOU
AT HOME TONIGHT.
GLENDON RITTER,
C.E.O.
OF STRADWICK PHARMACEUTICALS.
ISN'T HE PRESIDENT
OF THE ARTS COUNCIL?
WELL,YOU SHOULD GO
SAY HELLO.
YOU COME WITH.
NO,NO,YOU...
YOU GO.
I'M ALL OUT
OF SMALL TALK.
GO AHEAD.
MR. RITTER.
SO HAPPY
YOU COULD MAKE IT.
THOMAS?
DO YOU SEE IT?
NO.
WHY? YOU DO?
IT'S BEEN GONE
FOR EIGHT YEARS.
WHY NOW?
COME BACK DOWNSTAIRS WITH ME.
THAT'S THE WAY OUT. IT...
IT HAS TO BE.
AND IF IT IS...
AND YOU WALK THROUGH IT...
WHAT HAPPENS
TO ALL OF THIS?
TO US?
I DON'T KNOW.
AND I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT.
I WANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON
NEXT MONTH,
AND I WANT TO WATCH YOU
GET PROMOTED.
I WANT TO SEE WHO KYLE MARRIES.
SO DO I...
BUT THIS DOOR,IT'S...
IT'S BACK FOR A REASON.
IT'S LIKE
IT WANTS ME TO WALK THROUGH IT.
BUT DO YOU WANT
TO WALK THROUGH IT?
I DON'T WANT YOU TO,EITHER.
COME ON,THOMAS.
LET'S GO HOME.
KYLE!
NO,KYLE'S MY SON!
LEAVE ME ALONE! HE'S MY SON!
KYLE!
STOP.
LET GO OF ME!
WHAT...
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU MADE IT.
WHERE ARE WE?
I THINK YOU KNOW.
THIS IS WHERE
THEY BROUGHT YOU...
AND THE REST OF THE 4400.
YES,THIS IS WHERE
THEY ALTERED US--
GAVE ME THE ABILITY
TO CREATE THE WORLD
WE'VE BEEN LIVING IN
FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.
SO IT IS YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
THE WHOLE TIME.
WE'VE BEEN LIVING
IN MY MIND,
BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS
FOR YOUR REALITY
CAME FROM THEM.
THEY CREATED
A SANCTUARY FOR YOU,
AN EASIER,
LESS COMPLICATED WORLD.
BUT NONE OF IT'S REAL.
YOU ARE.
I AM.
THE FEELINGS
WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER ARE
AS REAL AS ANYTHING
WE'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.
IS THAT WHY THEY DID THIS?
KEPT US HERE FOR EIGHT YEARS?
BECAUSE THEY WANTED US
TO FALL IN LOVE?
MOMENTS.
THAT'S ALL THAT'S PASSED,
BUT IN THOSE
FEW SECONDS,
WE'VE ACCUMULATED
YEARS OF MEMORIES
THAT WILL BOND US
IN THE REAL WORLD.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE WORRIED
ABOUT SAVING THE WORLD,
NOT PLAYING MATCHMAKER.
THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.
YOUR LIFE
IS ABOUT TO PLUNGE INTO CRISIS.
YOUR MISSION
WILL BE THREATENED.
THEY CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.
THEY GAVE YOU THIS RELATIONSHIP
AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH,
TO SUSTAIN YOU
IN THE TRIALS
THAT LAY AHEAD.
WHAT CRISIS? WHAT--
WHAT IS IT?
WHY CAN'T THEY JUST TELL ME
WHAT IT IS?
I CAN STOP IT FROM HAPPENING.
IT'S ALREADY BEGUN...
BUT NOW YOU WON'T HAVE TO
FACE IT ALONE.
NO,IF IT'S STARTED,
I HAVE TO GET BACK THERE.
ONLY YOUR WIFE
CAN GET YOU HOME.
YOU ARE MY WIFE.
NO.
I'M PART OF THE PROGRAM
THEY PLACED IN HER MIND.
SHE HAS NO IDEA
SHE'S CREATING THIS.
IF SHE DID,
IT WOULD INTERFERE
WITH THE BONDING.
SO,WHAT,I'M SUPPOSED
TO JUST FILL HER IN
AND TELL HER WHAT?
WHETHER SHE KNOWS IT OR NOT,
SHE'S WILLING THIS WORLD
INTO EXISTENCE.
SHE CAN WILL IT
OUT OF EXISTENCE.
YEAH,AND WHAT IF
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO?
YOU HAVE TO
CONVINCE HER.
THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TEST
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
THEY'VE CREATED A DAMN NEAR
PERFECT WORLD FOR ME.
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE?
THEN THE FUTURE
PICKED THE WRONG MAN.
WHAT ABOUT KYLE?
HE SPENT NINE YEARS
BECOMING A DOCTOR.
WHAT,AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET RID OF HIM?
WISH HIM AWAY?
IT'S NOT REALLY KYLE.
DON'T SAY THAT!
IF IT'S NOT KYLE,
WHO'S MOVING AROUND
DOWNSTAIRS IN THE KITCHEN?
KYLE. SHAWN. DANNY.
NONE OF THEM ARE REAL.
THEY'RE JUST PROJECTIONS.
YOU'VE SPENT EIGHT YEARS
WITH THESE PEOPLE.
THEY'RE AS REAL TO YOU
AS THEY ARE TO ME.
I LOVE MY FAMILY.
I REALLY DO LOVE THEM.
IT'S NOT THAT I WANT TO DO THIS.
IT'S THAT WE HAVE TO DO IT.
BUT THEY'RE MY FAMILY,TOO.
BACK THERE,
I'M JUST A STRANGER TO THEM.
WHAT ABOUT YOU AND ME?
OUR LIFE?
IS THAT A PROJECTION,TOO?
NO.
WHAT WE HAVE,OUR MEMORIES,
THEY'LL CARRY OVER
INTO THE REAL WORLD.
BUT IT WON'T BE THE SAME.
IT CAN'T BE.
MAYBE NOT,
BUT WHATEVER WE HAVE,
IT'LL BE REAL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MAKE IT GO AWAY.
WHAT DO I DO?
STARE AT IT UNTIL IT DISAPPEARS?
NO,JUST BELIEVE
IT'S NOT THERE.
WELL,THANKS
FOR COMING,EVERYBODY.
ALANA AND I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU ALL THAT...
WE'RE GOING TO BE
LEAVING.
WE'RE TAKING
A VACATION.
WE'LL BE GONE
FOR A WHILE,AND,UH...
I KNOW IT'S SUDDEN,
BUT WE JUST DECIDED
THIS MORNING.
WELL,
HOW LONG IS A WHILE?
I MEAN,YOU JUST GOT THE BIGGEST
PROMOTION OF YOUR CAREER.
IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT.
WE WANTED TO SEE YOU ALL
ONE LAST TIME BEFORE WE GO,
AND TELL YOU...
HOW MUCH WE LOVE YOU.
THAT'S SO SWEET.
CAREFUL,ALANA.
SHE'S GOING TO BE CRYING
IN A SECOND.
IT'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO DO.
IT'S A...
IT'S A TRIP THAT WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
NOT FAR.
WELL...
SEND US A POSTCARD...
AT LEAST.
TO THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH WE WILL MISS YOU.
WE WILL MISS YOU,TOO.
DON'T LOOK BACK.
TOM?
TOM?
ARE YOU WITH ME,TOM?
CAN YOU EMAIL ME
THE MAREVA FILE?
ALANA MAREVA?
YEAH,A.K.A. RETURNEE 2155.
SHE WAS JUST HERE
DOING HER MED EVAL.
IT'S MY WEEK
TO DO REPORTS,
REMEMBER?
DIANA,THE 4400,
THE BALL OF LIGHT,
IT HAPPENED,RIGHT?
SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU--
- JUST TELL ME IT HAPPENED.
- YES,OF COURSE IT HAPPENED.
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE BEEN
DOING HERE THE LAST YEAR?
THAT'S GREAT.
MY GOD.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
ALANA. ALANA!
ALANA!
ALANA,WAIT!
THOMAS.
we are not a threat.
we are salvation.
the world will have to deal with us.
previously on the 4400
remember me?
Nikki?
You're the only good thing that's
happened to me since I've been back.
Dan-- oh!
Danny!
Danny!
Stop blaming me for nikki!
Shawn, stop it.
You're killing him!
So this whole "see the future" thing.
it doesn't just apply to
earth-shattering events. huh?
Not always.
That one.
Baby girl, you are my new lucky charm.
Do you know what I bet?
Try my mother's diamond engagement ring.
and now it's gone.
You said winning didn't matter.
You said you liked me.
This was all just a test...
and you failed.
This doesn't sound like me, lucy.
So change it.
You're the boss.
Matthew ross.
Yes.
Jordan made it clear that
in the event of his death.
I was to step up front and center to help you out.
The ground just shifted under your feet.
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.
The fact is that everyone
alive today owes jordan collier.
He had a vision to save the future.
You were waiting in the hallway
outside my apartment last night.
I don't know how I got there.
Please. believe me.
I had another blackout last night.
Kyle?
Kyle!
Yeah, I'm in here.
Hold on a sec.
It's 10 after 8:00.
You taking the day off?
I guess my alarm didn't go off.
You'd better get moving.
Your first class is at 9:00 on tuesdays, right?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Want me to get you some smelling salts?
Come on, buddy. it's time to roll.
Let's go.
Alana called last night.
I forgot to tell you.
She's in barcelona, kyle.
There's only like a 20-minute
window when we're both awake.
Any message?
Yeah, She...she.uh.
she bought a couple of paintings for her gallery.
and she misses you.
Next time she calls and I'm not here-- yeah.
yeah. I'll try to remember.
I've got to get ready, Okay?
Right, Well, I can't wait.
You're going to have to grab the bus.
and don't leave your towel
on the bathroom floor again. okay?
Ben?
Tyler?
My god. You haven't changed.
50-year vacation will do that for you.
You look...
I look old.Especially next to you.
I had you beat by eight months.
Last time I saw you was...
in a tent, Outside of sinanju, Korea.
May 11th. 1951.
You remember the date.
Sometimes I have trouble
remembering my grandkid's birthday.
but that's a day that I'll never forget it.
I mean, lee hit you.
and you, uh...
I don't know, you disappeared.
So. what are you doing here, ben?
You remember milton weinberg,
your old wingman?
Milt was the first guy who invited me over
to sit at his table in the officers' mess.
He passed on.
Parkinson's disease.
I'm sorry.I knew you guys were close.
And I'm sure he would
want you at the funeral.
Is.uh...
lee going to be there?
We treated you as an equal.
but that wasn't good enough for you.
You had to cross the line.
None of us has spoken to lee in years.
I'll be there...
out of respect for milt.
Is he okay?
Better than okay.
Heart rate, respiration, reflexes...
all above average.
Say hello to your healthy child.
Edwin.I...
I can't even find the words.
We don't know how to thank you.
And he's going to know all about you.
the nurse who changed his life.
Enjoy your son, mr. And mrs. Ward.
Keep him safe.
Edwin.do you have a second?
I'm sorry. doctor.
I'm due in the nursery.
It can wait.
I want to know what
you did to the ward baby.
We did amnio in the first trimester.
That baby was diagnosed
with prader-willi syndrome.
Perhaps there was some mistake in the tests.
You saw those results, edwin.
The 15th chromosome was damaged.
That indicates severe
mental retardation at birth.
but their kid just scored
nine on the apgar test.
A miracle is traditionally cause
for celebration, not an inquisition.
This is the fourth time this
has happened in the last six months.
In every one of those cases.
edwin. you are the attending nurse.
And you're one of the 4400.
I'm not sure I see the connection.
Everyone's read about that
kid who's running the 4400 center now.
They say he's cured diseases like A.L.S..
Diseases no hospital in
the world can put a dent in.
He's a healer.
So are you.
For me, it only works in utero.
I can feel the damage
to their chromosomes.
I'm not sure exactly how it works.but,
somehow, I'm able to repair them.
That's incredible.
Dr.Hodler,
if it's all the same to you.
I'd prefer to work anonymously.
There are already rumors in
this hospital of miracle births, edwin.
and people talk.
I don't think you're
going to have that option.
<i>So long ago.</i>
<i>another life</i>
<i>I can feel your heart beat</i>
<i>it's not a dream remember us</i>
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>
<i>our place in time beyond the sun</i>
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>
<i>our place in time to call our own</i>
Wait a minute.
xxxx
Maybe we missed something.
There were a thousand people at
the party where collier got assassinated.
Wouldn't you think that they could at least
send us a new set of completely useless files
Any hot leads in there?
I didn't think so.
I'm pulling you off the collier case,
just for the moment.
Something important, I hope.
One of the files in the morning
research report caught my eye.
There's an internet chat
room for pregnant women.
Yesterday,someone
started a thread about some
unexplained reversals of
birth defects at mercy hospital.
So you're yanking us off collier
to check out internet chatter?
There's a 4400 who works at the hospital.
Bingo.
Edwin mayuya.
He was born in rwanda.
So this guy's some kind of healer?
According to the internet.
Don't worry, you're still the alpha dog.
It's not like I mind.
It's great if he is, of course.
We should invite him to the center.
At the very least,
I think mr.Mayuya merits a sitdown.
All right, set it up.
I'll be there.
Why don't you let me
handle the meet and greet?
I'll figure out if there's
anything to these stories.
In the meantime,
there's a move I'd like
you to consider making.
Call it the next phase in
your development as a leader.
Matthew, I told you,
I will read the art of war, okay?
I want you to call your mom.
I know jordan counseled you
to distance yourself from your family.
Before jordan was telling me anything,
my family had already distanced themselves from me.
Family dynamics are complex.
I don't think that a phone call
is going to lead straight into some kind of group hug.
Even if it leads to just dinner,
you're heading in the right direction.
But,matthew
what is it to you?
Right now,every news desk in the country
is taking a long,hard look at you.
They're looking for a weakness.
And because I'm not speaking to my family,
that implies what?
Everybody here is supposed to do likewise?
The press will spin it that way.
That's how they smear us with the "cult" label.
You want me to stir up all of this old business
as a publicity ploy?
You can take care of it now,or wait
and see it splashed all over the newspapers.
Here's your mom's phone number.
In case you forgot.
comes in and says,
"how do you think I rang the bell?"
We were just saying,what a nice ceremony this was,Old milt
he left a great family behind.
He had a lot of love to spread around.
We thought you got killed,
or captured, maybe.
There was some talk you went awol.
None of us put any stock in that.
Disappearing in a beam of light-- nobody thought of that,huh?
Hey,uh, you in town tonight?
Oh, good.We're going to have our own private wake for milt down at chauncey'S.
You know he loved his bud,
so we're going to hoist a few in his memory.
You should come.
We'll kick around old times.
"Old times" was hardly more than a year ago for me.
You can fill in the gaps,then.
There's a lot of stuff we don't remember anymore.
Chance to swap tall tales with you old duffers?
Wouldn't miss it.
Ntac has examined me several times already this year.
I don't think I'm due for another for?
three months,I believe.
You've never missed an appointment.
We appreciate that.
You just admitted to us that you've developed this ability.
It's a kind of earth-shaking one,I have to say.
Forgive me,
but I don't see how submitting
to another round of tests helps anyone.
These mutations you can induce--
I believe they are not mutations,sir.
I believe they are repairs.
Either way,our doctors need to take a look at you.
If they can figure out the way your ability works,
it could help a lot of people.
All right,then.
I will let your doctors poke and prod me to their hearts' content.
But I ask one thing--
that you allow me my privacy.
I do not want to become a public figure.
Well,that works for us.
I mean,whenever a new ability leaks to the press--
good,bad,or whatever--
it stirs a lot of people up.
Precisely what I hope to avoid.
I've seen firsthand the type of behavior
that irrational fears can provoke.
You left rwanda in april of 1994.
That was the beginning of the tutsis' genocide.
The beginning?
Believe me,I saw my fill of horrors during those two weeks.
If I hadn't been granted asylum here in america,
I'd be dead.
You were probably just getting used to the place when you got abducted,I'm sure.
There were nights in kigali when I would have welcomed the chance
to disappear from the face of this earth.
So, uh,just let me get this straight--
you used maia's predictions so that you could gamble?
I didn't use her to gamble.
I used her to win.
You mean that you used her to cheat.
You exploited a nine-year-old girl who loves you.
She was having a good time.
We both were.
But only one of you is an adult.
I can't believe that you're standing there defending it.
Well, this part of it,
I can kind of mount a credible defense.
What,so you haven't got to the part that you're ashamed of yet?
These bets?
they were sure things?
but I needed money to make them.
You know mom's engagement ring?
You mean the one that she left to me?
The one I should have worn to my wedding.
I pawned it.
I just can't believe that I let maia anywhere near you.
I want you out of here.
Lucy.
If I watch the news tonight,
am I going to be a happy man?
The stations I called all seemed very interested.
A 4400 who cures birth defects?
I'd cover it.
I suppose the tip was anonymous?
Believe me,I didn't want to leave my name.
The center outing a 4400 to the media?
Seems wrong somehow.
Well,it's not business as usual,I grant you,
but we leak it,we control the story,
and it beats letting him rot in the basement at ntac.
Did shawn go upstairs for the night?
He went out.
Personal business,he said.
Good night, lucy.
Who is it?
Hello?
Mom,are you going to,uh, are you going to open the door,
or should i use my key?
Shawn!
I would've-- I would've called ahead,but I?
?surprise.
Will the 4400 prove to be the cure for all human disease?
That's the question on everyone's lips,
as it appears a member of the 4400
has manifested the ability to reverse certain genetic birth defects in utero.
Anonymous sources claim that edwin mayuya,
a 38-year-old nurse at mercy hospital?
murderer!
...Is responsible for a series of miraculous healings?
murderer!
over the past five months.
Murderer!
Murderer!
but if these claims prove true--
that's the man,
the one who killed your parents!
There's more.
I'm bouncing around in the shotgun seat.
and tyler here has got the gas
pedal all the way through the floor?
hey. we had 200 bucks on that race?
and davis is 30 feet behind me.
and I can barely hear him screaming--
not that way.
That's where the landmines are.
If I knew he was serious.
maybe I would have paid attention.
Yeah.Yeah.
Well.no one was going to follow us that way.
so we came in two minutes before the pack.
and we split the money.
We bought like five kegs of
budweiser for the officers' club.
Get a load of this.
Looks just like it did back in the day.
Like you.tyler.
Hard to believe-- 50 years go by.
we got the same guys.
same beer.
It's great to see you guys.
It's a shame it took milt
dying to make it happen.
It's hard to find excuses
to get the whole gang together.
It's not exactly the whole gang, is it?
There's always lee.
Which one of you guys
is going to tell me where he is?
Come on does it matter?
Matters to me.
Well.last I heard.he was in
a V.A.Hospital outside of bakersfield.
In bad shape for a long time.
Look.everyone here feels
terrible about what we did to you.
Huh? Isn't that enough?
You're not going to get
anything out of talking to lee. I mean.
do yourself a favor-- just let it go.
I don't give a damn.
I don't care if he?
What's up?
You know your miracle healer?
Turns out his real name is edwin musinga.
All his papers have been forged.
He's been wanted by the
rwandan government since 1995.
Wanted for what?
Atrocities.
He was a doctor during the uprising.
He's killed a whole bunch of people.
I was a pediatrician at a clinic in kigali.
I am a hutu.
but most of my patients were tutsi.
Many of my friends as well.
That called my loyalty into
question when the killings began.
Some men from the military came to my clinic.
and they said they wanted
to broadcast it as a safehouse.
a place tutsi could come
to be safe from the slaughter.
And they came?
By 3:00.the clinic was full.
Every room. every corridor.
all filled with frightened tutsi
looking to me as their protector.
The same soldiers came back?
with militia at their side.
It was a setup.
Did you at least try to stop them?
The radio reports were claiming
the tutsis had killed our president.
The anger spread like virus.
I got infected. too.
So basically. you stood by and did nothing?
All over the city.it was organized murder.
We never would have made it to safety.
You could have tried.
Easy tom.
Let the man finish his story.
Yes.I could have tried.
That's true.I know that now.
They made me watch.
They killed them all.
I allowed them to turn
my clinic into a slaughterhouse.
But you didn't murder anyone personally.
True.
but not much of a distinction.
I knew what was going to happen.
I let it take place.
I'm guilty.
My wife left me.
I have not seen her or my children since.
Perhaps they will come to my execution.
Your government's pushing for extradition.
You should be on a plane right now.
But your ability?
complicates things.
It would give me the
chance to make amends.
But I could save an infant
every day for the rest of my life.
and I'd still deserve
every one of my nightmares.
What was going on in there tom?
Because if you were looking to shut
him down before he got his story out.
all that glaring was a
great way to go about it.
That guy should be
on his way to a tribunal.
Instead.we're serving
him lunch downstairs.
Oh.what. would you
prefer it if we starved him?
I don't believe you're defending him!
I would never defend what he did.
but I would make an
argument for what he can do now.
There's a reason the future
sent him back with this amazing ability.
But forgive me if I sound like?
I don't know.you?
No.No.not this time.
No.we're not talking about a criminal.
We're not even talking about a murderer.
We're talking about genocide, Dian
Maybe the future doesn't
have a problem with that.but I do.
So if I don't believe that the world is
better off with a bullet in this guy's head.
I'm advocating genocide?
No.
There are people in rwanda
right now who have lost mothers.
brothers. and children in that clinic.
and he stood by.
and he let it happen.
That's just like our government.
just like governments all over the world.
They all knew what was happening. tom.
but nobody lifted a finger to stop it.
Yeah. and that was wrong. too.
and so is this.
We've been working on
blind faith for a year and a half.
assuming these people
knew what they were doing.
but enough is enough.
Yeah.we're saving the future.
but we're leaving justice behind.
Is it something that you
want to be a part of. diana?
so shawn just shows out of nowhere,
and all of a sudden I'm supposed to drop all of my plans
and head to some peace dinner,
We both know why he's turned up now, right?
You don't have to be a shrink to piece it together,
His mentor daddy figure gets killed,
and he comes crawling back to mommy,
Danny,why don't you quit whining about shawn?
He's your brother,It's been a year,Let it go,
Hey, you're the guy who talked to him and told me how brainwashed he is,
So if he's coming for dinner,
that's a good thing, right?
At least pretend it is,
for your mom's sake,
What's with the attitude, man?
I just don't want to hear you bitch anymore, okay?
I don't understand,
Why do you have to go?
Can't you just say you're sorry?
It doesn't always work that way with grown-ups,
Sometimes things gets so messed up
that "sorry" doesn't cut it,
Happens a lot when I'm involved,actually,
But if you only just leave,
nothing gets better,
Sweetie...
I'm sorry,
I used you,
It was wrong,
But I forgive you,
I still have to go,
Well,I know I cooked all day
but is my lasagna really that great?
You're both just stunned into silence?
I haven't had this stuff in,
like a year,
Good,You said something,
Danny, why don't you give it a try?
All right,you know what?
That's it, Danny,
this entire night is about you and me,
That's why mom did this,
you know?What do you want me to do,
say we're all fine and dandy?
It's not that easy,
I don't expect it to be,
but you and I obviously have some stuff we need to get into the open
Okay,so you're going to apologize to me now,
is that it?
Or was I just imagining it when you screwed my girlfriend?
The thing with nikki,
I wish it wouldn't have happened that way,
What about almost stopping my heart,
or whatever it is that you did?
You feel bad about that, too?
You know what?
You want to hate me forever?
You be my guest,
But you're my brother,
and I came here to make things right by you,
What do you want me to do?
You need to punch me in the face or something?I mean
be my guest
Danny, don't you dare,
Just one shot, ma,
He deserves it,
Look,he's even asking for it,
Are we okay?Are we done?
We're letting him walk?
He's responsible for hundreds of deaths,
His degree of culpability is not for us to determine,
Okay,look,I can't ship him off to rwanda,
Not yet,anyway,
In the meantime,his 48-hour hold is up,
and the 4400 center has hired lawyers who are pressing for his release,
The press are all over this story,
Will he even be safe on the streets?
Yeah, a war criminal's safety,
that's my big concern,
Oh, it had better be,
In exchange for protection,
edwin musinga has agreed to continue coming into our labs,
We're babysitting him?
In exchange for a chance to study what he can do,
This guy could advance genetic research by a hundred years,
It sounds like a fair trade to me,
Mm-hmm,
How long have you been feeling faint?
On and off,perhaps a month,
You should have told your doctors,
You forget,miss skouris,I am a doctor,
I have been anemic since I was 15,
I'm certain--
you okay?
Yeah,
Stay with him,I'm going out,
Stay down,Stay down,stay down,
Take these people out of here,
I want a patrol car passing by every 20 minutes,
Help!
Someone call an ambulance!
I think she's having a heart attack,
He did this to her,
Why are you protecting him?
He's a murderer!
How did this become public?
Well,I assure you,
it wasn't ntac,
Perhaps if I had gone out and spoken to them,
this could have been avoided,
Oh, yeah,that would have calmed them down,
They could have torn you apart,
I think I have already demonstrated the lengths
I'm willing to go in order to live,
You can add another victim to your list,
That woman is dead,
Okay,tom,why don't you just go back outside?
Take a walk around the block,
You know why she was out there?
Huh?
Because this son of a bitch
let her son,her daughter-in-law,and about eight of her nephews and nieces die,
Huh?
Isn't that right, doctor?
Tom, stop!
Isn't that right?
stop!
I regret her death,
same as I regret them all,
Yeah,well, I'm sorry you feel bad,
but it doesn't change anything,does it?
Tom, enough,
Let him go,
Now!
Let him go,
Look, benjamin,
I don't see what the problem is,
Edwin musinga never killed anybody,
Not personally,anyway,
I already told you which senators to call,
Get face time if you can,
Do I have to fly out there and do this myself?
I thought not,
Blackberry me when things start to tip,
Full-court press is on?
I kind of wish I was out there,
Cash in a few favors,
watch the hill fall in line...
do we really want to be cashing in favors for this guy?
He says himself he's dirty,
Oh, he's worse than dirty,
He's practically a mass murderer,
So why are we wasting our time with him?
Somebody might come along who actually deserves our help, matthew,
He's a 4400,
Guilty or not,he's a part of what we're doing,
They gave him that ability for a reason,
and I doubt it has anything to do with being executed in rwanda,
So let's say he didn't come back with an ability,
Would we still be fighting the good fight on his behalf?
You're the boss,
You tell me,
Breakfast is ready,
You know you're going to start talking to me eventually,right?
I seriously doubt that you can hold out till you're 18,
She used you,maia,
She said she was sorry,
Well,there--there still has to be consequences,
your ability is a gift,
but it makes you a target, too,
and I have to protect you from people who want to exploit you,
Besides,
you're not the only one your aunt april hurt this week,
But I showed her the ring,
She wouldn't even have known about it if it weren't for me,
Well, you should never have been playing with it,
which is why you don't get any tv this week,
What your aunt did was completely different,
and she knows it,
She made a bad mistake,
Isn't that what having a family's about?
Forgiving someone when they make a bad mistake?
It doesn't matter if I forgive her,
I...
I just can't have her around you,
But we don't have such a big family,
We can't just kick someone out--
even if they mess up,
Oh, maia,
you've got to-- do me a favor,
Stop being more grown-up than your mom,
Now, just come on,
Come on,Your cereal's getting mushy,
let's go,
I am not kidding you,
It was,like,the most intense wrist-burn I think I've ever given,
He took it like a man,I'll give him that,
After that,we ate,
we talked a little bit,
I was surprised-- it was pretty much okay,
Good to hear,
I was glad I went,
Well, you know what that makes you?
Right,
Yeah,I'm a genius,
I don't get it,kyle,
Look,you're pissed at me when I tell you I don't want to see shawn,
and then I do it,and I tell you it went pretty good,
and I get a big shrug,
Nobody asked you to sit here, man,
What's going on,kyle?
What,are you blacking out again?
Just forget it,
Look, if you don't tell me what's going on,
I'll talk to your dad,
I am not blacking out,all right?
I feel fine,You're not saying a word to my dad,
Yeah?
Then tell me why you're walking around like a zombie,
I can remember now,
Some of the things I was doing during those blackouts,I can remember,
Like what?
I'm in trouble,that's all I can tell you,
I'm in big trouble,
Is there anything I can do?
Help yourself,
Stay away from me,
Got a cigarette?
You have emphysema,
I know I have emphysema,
What I don't have is a cigarette,
Do you know who I am?
For a second,I thought you were the angel of death,
Richard tyler,
How was weinberg's funeral?
Simple,
Dignified,Kind of like milt,
Never did like his politics much,
You know,after you disappeared,he blamed me,
Fought me once or twice,
Of course,he was wrong,
So what are you here for?
Going to slap me around a little bit?
Shut off my oxygen tank?
Uh...
you don't make a very appealing target these days,lee,
What,then?Looking for an apology?
When I first got back,
I used to lie awake in quarantine thinking about you,
All the things I would do to you if I ever saw you again,
Oh,
You want vengeance,
Well,
sorry to disappoint you,That's not going to work out either,
Time has kicked my ass worse than you ever could,
Time kicks everybody's ass,lee,
Get you too,eventually,
Caught up with old milt,didn't it,for sure,
At the funeral,
those guys were tripping over each other to say sorry,
But you've had 50 years to dwell on what you did...
I didn't like hitting a fellow officer,
but you gave me cause,
I ate beside you,I fought beside you,
but when you took up with a white woman,
you crossed the line,
That's what you said back then,
I'm saying it again now,
The world's changed,lee,or haven't you noticed?
The world,maybe,Not me,
And how's that working out for you?
I stopped by your room,
No cards,
No flowers,
The lady at the front desk couldn't believe you had a visitor,
You know,
I really wish you'd brought some cigarettes,
You always did stick to your habits,lee...
even after they started to kill you,
So long,
They're not just statistics,diana,
He let that happen,
I know what he did,
and I don't need you to rub my nose in it,
It's worth putting the faces to the numbers,
We've got a problem,
The state department has decided to fight extradition,
They're going to argue special circumstances,
So edwin gets a pass?
And who knows how many kids get a shot at a normal life?
No, not as many as we'd hoped,
Our labs can't even figure out how his ability works,
forget about replicating it,
And I just got his med eval,
It turns out he's in bad shape,
Well, he told me he's anemic,
and he couldn't sleep,
No,no,it's worse than that,
This ability,every time he rearranges a fetal chromosome,
he's damaging his own,
So if he keeps healing...
it's going to kill him,
Listen, if you don't want to talk about what you did,
I'm not going to try to force you to,
But I guarantee you,whatever it is,
there's a way out of it,
That's easy to say,You don't know what it is,
So tell us,
How can we help you if we don't know what's going on?
I didn't ask for help,
In fact,I told you not to mention it to anyone, danny,
And I'm not "anyone",
I'm your friend,
Stop saying that, okay?
I know you two mean well,
but you don't have a goddamn clue what you're talking about,
I have to deal with this on my own,
We get it,
On your own,Absolutely,
And we're going to help you do that,
I think what he's trying to say
is if you need some time to clear your head and get away from everything so you can figure stuff out,
I can make that happen,
Come to the center with me, kyle,
You're turning this into a recruiting drive?
That's not what I'm talking about,
You will have the space you need,
No one will bother you,
Kyle,if you ever get to the point where you feel like you want to talk to somebody,
we have counselors,
therapists, lawyers,
It was worth a try, man,
because whatever you're doing right now,it's not working,
My car is outside,
You can come with me right now,if you want,
Okay,
Just let me... I got a couple of things to take care of...
get a leave of absence from school,stuff like that,
I'll meet you there tonight,
And I'll be waiting,
Okay,
Thank you, guys,
How much time do I have left?
Well,that's difficult to say,
I mean,your genes are mutating every time you heal a fetus,
There's an indication of heart disease developing,
You have spinal irregularities on your mri,
If you keep healing,maybe a year, maybe less,
And if I stop?
Oh,well,I mean, if you stop healing,
then there's no reason for the state department to fight the extradition,
You'll be handed back to the rwandan government,
Who will have me tried and sentenced with all dispatch,
So...
either choice that I make leads to my death,
Yes,that's right,
It would seem my abductors have quite a perverse sense of humor,
I will,of course,continue to heal
for as long as my body allows,
At least then,my death will have a purpose other than vengeance,
You'll have to be monitored by doctors from here on in,
They'll try and slow your decline,
but you really should come with us,
because we have some of the best physicians in the world on payroll,
Miss skouris,if you're offering me a bed at ntac,
I'm afraid I have to refuse,
I did not pass up one prison so I can die in another,
There is one place you could go,
Ntac medical's going to need him five days a week,
so I'll get you the schedule,
We'll make sure he's there on time, every time,
Edwin musinga,this is shawn farrell,
He runs the center,
and you two have a lot in common,
Not a lot,
Just one thing,
One very important thing,
Did you tell him?
Yeah,He's going to keep healing,
Not that that surprises me,
I took him over to the 4400 center,
I think he's probably better off there than he is at home,
How does it feel, tom?
Some babies'll get saved,
and you'll get your pound of flesh,
You really want to know?
I asked you, didn't I?
It feels like justice,
Hi
How'd you find me?
Sometimes it's good to have a kid who knows things,
What's in berkeley?
A tattoo shop that likes my work,
Oh, Some friends I can force myself on for a while,
Listen,di...
I said this to maia,but...
I'm so sorry,
Well, it's nice to hear,
but it doesn't change anything,
You are so deceitful,and you're completely untrustworthy,and--
well,you're not seeing maia until you've proven otherwise,
I wish I knew how to make things right,
Yeah,I wish I did, too,
And I do know it's going to take a long time,
But you're still my sister,
and you're the only one I've got,
and I'm, uh...
well, I'm not giving up on you,
You bought it back from the pawn shop,
I know you always felt that mom should have left it to you,
and tell you the truth,
I thought she only gave it to me because she...
well, she figured that was the only way I was ever going to get one of those things,
Hmm, That's a whole othertherapy session,
Di, I don't deserve this,
No,you don't,
but you're going to take it anyway,
One day...
maia's going to wear that ring to her wedding...
and I hope--
well,
I hope you know each other again by then,
Yeah,
Kyle?
Dad,
I had to leave,
I'm sorry,
Kyle?Hey,it's me,
Uh, where are you, man?
It's 2:00 A,M,
You're not here yet,
Listen, just-- when you get this,
call me,or just show up,
Okay?Show up,
All right,
Yeah,I know you two mean well,
but you don't have a goddamn clue what you're talking about,
I have to deal with this on my own
Previously on the 4400...
I'm blacking out.
If you're losing chunks of time,
you should talk to your dad about it.
What's he going to do ?
Turn me over to NTAC medical ?
Let me see if i've got this straight.
You two met, fell in love, and spent eight years
together in some kind of alternative reality ?
Liv, you were pretty far
gone last night.
When i O. D., it's not going
to be any big loss, right ?
Maybe i can save you.
Whatever it is,
there's a way out of it.
That's easy to say.
You don't know what "it" is.
You told me everything
that happened that night, right ?
Yeah.
If you need some time
to clear your head
and get away from everything
so you can figure stuff out,
I can make that happen.
dad,
i had to leave. I'm sorry.
Look, i'm not interested in excuses.
I don't care how you do it,
who you have to lean on,
You just get him out of
lock-up and over to L. A. X.
I want him on
the next plane out.
Skouris, where's Baldwin ?
He's not in yet. Why ?
What's going on ?
L. A. P. D. Is holding some piece of street garbage
who wants to see daylight again.
Says he can make the dealer
who sold the Collier murder weapon.
Who's handling
the l. A. Interview ?
Nobody. I'm having him shipped
up here for questioning.
This one feels good.
My partner's going to
like hearing that.
You can fill me in when
i get to the office.
Look, i know we're not ready
to pop any champagne yet, but
this witness has intel we kept out of the media,
specific details about the Collier murder weapon.
Sounds like we finally
caught a break.
Look, Diana, i really have to go.
Are you okay ?
You sound a little distracted.
It's personal business.
Not your worry.
Well, any idea
what time you'll be in ?
I can't really say just yet.
Look, i'll get in touch with you
as soon as i can, okay ?
Okay, no problem.
Bye.
How long has this been going on ?
Calm down.
No. I asked you a question.
How long ?
Look, Kyle told me, like, a month ago.
Look, you remember that night ?
Wha...
What night ?
The night that he almost got arrested
for smashing that store window.
You mean when he got drunk ?
He never said he was drunk.
You said he was drunk.
Kyle said he blacked out.
It happened a bunch of times
after that. One minute,
he'd be one place, the next thing
he knew, he was someplace else.
He never mentioned it to me.
He never said anything.
Well, he tried once,
but you wouldn't listen.
Look, you could have
come to me, Danny,
Told me what was going on.
He's your cousin, your friend.
Which is why i promised him not to.
The last thing Kyle wanted was to
be thrown back into quarantine.
Danny, Kyle never came
home last night.
If you know where he is,
please, tell me.
He went to stay with Shawn
over at the 4400 center.
Great.
Uncle Tommy...
There's something else
you ought to know.
Kyle thinks he did something
during one of his blackouts.
He wouldn't tell us what it was,
But he really seemed
freaked out about it.
This is the committee
latest recommendation
37-Year-old pipe fitter from Detroit.
He was diagnosed with hodgkin's
disease four months ago.
When do we fly him in ?
Two days from now.
Shawn.
Where is he ?
Who ? Kyle ? He's not here.
Don't play games with me, Shawn.
Can you excuse us, Lucy ?
Thank you.
Danny said Kyle came here.
Yeah, well, Danny needs to check his text
messages, because Kyle never showed.
You're not listening to me, Shawn.
I want my son.
You're not hearing me.
He's not here. Where do you think
i have him stashed, in the basement ?
I wouldn't put it past you.
Oh, my g...
Uncle Tommy !
Just because Kyle is having a rough time
does not make it my fault !
Been known to happen, Shawn.
He's not here !
he's not here.
Kyle ?
Thomas.
I picked this up
in a village outside Barcelona,
And they said it was very special.
What's wrong ?
Kyle never told me any of this.
At least i'm not the only one
out of the loop.
I thought the doctors said he was
fine when he left quarantine.
They did...
But he spent three years with a separate
consciousness living inside of him.
I don't think the doctors
knew what to do with that.
Have you called the police ?
I can't get them involved,
not until i know what Kyle did.
What about Linda ?
Well, she says she hasn't heard from him.
Promises to call if she does.
I'm sorry about all of this.
I'm just glad i'm back.
Where are you going ?
Well, i'm not going
to find him sitting here.
I'll come with you.
No. Look... I'd rather you
stay here by the phone.
This way, if he calls...
You'll be here.
Okay.
I'll stay in touch.
and this guy is some
big-deal media consultant ?
oh, he's more than that.
Keith Petrick has prepped prime
ministers, members of parliament.
I'd say an interview with Sky News
merits a few hours' homework.
So he's going to tell me what ? Just new and
different ways to say "we're not a cult ?"
No,
he's going to teach you
to stay on message.
The british press loves
to play "gotcha."
Keith.
Matthew Ross. Thank you for coming.
This is Shawn Farrell.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Shawn.
Just one minute. Sorry.
Uncle Tommy came to see me.
Yeah. That's what i figured.
He came here, too.
What'd you tell him ?
Well, the truth.
Kyle ditched us. He never showed.
Listen,
you know, he might still show up.
- You know ?
- Yeah.
I'd give you the big tour, but...
Yeah. No. Things are crazy. I get it.
Wait, just wait, just wait.
Liv. Liv. Hey.
This is Danny, my brother.
- Hi.
- Hey.
This is Liv.
She's one of our first keys.
Actually, i'm second key now.
Really ?
I'm impressed. Star pupil.
Hey, do you think
you could give him a tour ?
You know, Shawn, you don't have to...
I want you to see the place.
Just hold on. Is that cool ?
Sure. Yeah.
It's cool.
You two kids have fun.
I've got to... I have to
go back to work, so...
That's my brother,
off to heal the world.
Somebody has to.
You ready ?
Yeah. I'm all yours.
I know who sold the rifle
that killed Collier.
That's a start.
Does we have a name ?
Victor Rios.
R- I-O-S.
He lives at 43207
Sumac Drive.
S- U-M-A-C...
I've got it. Thank you.
I'm at Victor's place last month.
He gets all cranked up and starts
waving this cannon around
Like he's the second coming
of Tony Montana.
He wants to swap it
for some of my product.
I told him i wasn't interested.
Can you describe
the weapon, mr. Kovec ?
I watched him put
that sucker together.
.50 caliber.
Never saw bullets so big.
And it had this humongous
scope on it,
Like a huge neon sign
saying "can't miss."
What makes you so sure this was
the weapon that killed Collier ?
Because...
Next time i saw Rios, he was bragging on
how much he scored for that piece.
This was, like...
Two days before Collier
got taken out.
I figure that's not a coincidence.
What do you think ?
I ask you to give him a quick tour,
and two hours later...
She's a good guide.
Really sells this place.
Danny was expecting
shaved heads and robes.
Yeah. I didn't see
a single tambourine.
Are you disappointed ?
Ah, you don't hear
me complaining.
So, hey, listen, big boss man,
You let your workers off
the farm at night ?
So i invited Liv to a party,
but she's too shy to ask if it's okay.
Think of her like a missionary...
A lot of potential recruits
out there at the northmount campus.
Could be cool. I haven't left
the center in a while.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I'm sorry, man. You're going to have
to find yourself a different date.
Who are you, her warden ?
Danny.
Listen, you guys can hang out here
as much as you want, no problem.
But a kegger,
that's an different story.
The wise and powerful
Shawn has spoken.
I hear and obey, your majesty.
I'm serious.
Since when did Shawn have
such a problem with keggers ?
Since he developed
a messiah complex.
So what time's this party ?
All right.
I woke up in the middle of the night and there
was Kyle, out here, crouching in the hallway.
With no idea how he got there.
That's right.
And i sent him away.
You were, uh..
you were scared.
It's understandable.
Not as scared as he was.
I told him he needed to get help, that
he should talk to you about these blackouts.
I wish he had.
We'd have worked it out.
Well, he wanted to.
Then what stopped him ?
Look, Mr. Baldwin, your relationship
with your son is none of my business...
Agreed, but if you have
something to say, say it.
I'm sure Kyle loves you...
But i don't think he really trusts you.
What ?
He told you that ?
Pretty much.
Eggs, butter, walnuts,
cocoa powder.
Who said making
brownies was difficult ?
Don't forget to preheat
the oven at 350 degrees.
Uh-Oh.
Now things are getting
really complicated.
Relax.
I'm just kidding.
Yeah ?
Now ?
No. That shouldn't be a problem.
I just need to get a sitter first.
If there's a problem,
i'll call you back.
I'm sorry, sweetie, i've got to go
to work. I'll call mrs. Skalka, see...
No, wait. Don't go.
Well, i have to. We can make
brownies another time.
That man...
You don't want to catch him.
What man ?
The man you're chasing after.
Someone's going to get hurt.
Who ?
Is it someone i work with ?
I don't know.
Just don't go.
Are you worried about me ?
Don't go.
Do you think i should get to
my car and head for the border ?
Or ask to be assigned
to another case.
Hmm. Hand the risk
off to another agent ?
It's not an option.
Have you told Tom ?
No, not yet. He's been off
the case for a while.
Might be better for his health
if he stays that way.
She said someone was going to
get hurt, but she didn't say who.
I don't know.
Maia's visions
aren't usually so vague.
This time, she's had a vision
involving her mother.
Maybe she doesn't want
to see it too clearly.
You're not making me
feel any better.
Okay.
How about this ?
Hmm ?
Any better ?
Sure.
You recognize that man,
Mrs. Rios ?
He was a customer
of your husband's.
Husband ?
He got me my green card
and more trouble than i need.
Why don't you ask victor ?
If you can find him.
Yeah, well, that's the problem, Mrs. Rios.
Your husband has left the country.
Now, we know he's in puerto rico.
You see ? You know more than me.
He didn't tell you he was leaving ?
I haven't seen him in two weeks.
Look, i need to get back to work.
A month ago, your husband
qold this man a weapon.
Your husband is implicated
in a murder, Mrs. Rios.
This is not a very good
thing for you.
Particularly if you value
your green card.
Why don't you just take
another look at the sketch ?
I remember the beanie.
Not a regular customer.
He only stopped by once.
He was the one
who bought the big rifle.
And the handgun.
What handgun ?
Uh, you know.
What do you call it ? A 9 mm.
Anything else ?
He was young... In his twenties.
Very quiet.
He only stayed a few minutes,
then left in a taxi.
How do you know that ?
I called it for him.
Oh, we're going to
need that number.
We were in the middle
of a bio-lab practical,
Kyle stood up, said he'd be
right back, and that was it...
Bye-Bye.
Didn't see him again
till the next day.
About what time did he leave ?
Had to be 7:00, 8:00, tops.
He's wrong, as usual.
It was closer to 6:00.
Don't you remember ?
We broke up right after Kyle ditched.
Yeah, look.
Anybody remember the date ?
End of last month, wasn't it ?
It was the 25th.
You sure ?
Yeah. I remember when i got back to
the dorm, it was all over the news.
Jordan Collier's murder.
Baldwin.
You going to grace us
with a visit tomorrow ?
Yeah, i'm hoping, but right now
it's looking doubtful.
Doubtful doesn't cut it.
We're closing in on this guy. Look,
we've got real leads, and i need you in here.
What kind of leads ?
You want to know ?
You get your ass into work.
Thomas, it could be anyone.
Look closer.
Tell me there isn't a resemblance.
This is insane. Why would Kyle
want to shoot Jordan Collier ?
If it happened during one of the blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.
Not if the future wanted
their number one prophet dead.
So you think they were
controlling him again ?
Yeah, directing his actions,
moving him around like a puppet.
Anything's possible.
Well, in that case,
he wasn't responsible.
The "body snatcher" defense ? Alana,
i'm not sure the jury's going to buy it.
What the hell do
they want from Kyle ?
They took four years of his life.
Isn't that enough ?
They warned us
about this, remember ?
They said you'd be
facing a crisis.
What, and that makes it all right ?
They warned me ?
I don't remember them telling me
they'd turn my son into a murderer.
There must be a reason.
Don't defend them, Alana.
Just don't ! They used me...
All of us... Kyle, Shawn.
I'm fed up.
I love him too.
I know. I know you do,
Alana. Just...
I've got to find him
before ntac does.
I've got to find him.
Stop it.
Serious business.
Your answers are going to determine
how far you would go in the center.
If that security guard comes by,
we'll both get kicked out.
Is that far enough ?
Okay... question number one...
Did you have fun tonight ?
Aren't you glad
we didn't listen to Shawn ?
That's two questions.
- Shh.
- Oh !
You're supposed to think about your
answers, not say them out loud.
- Right.
- Rules are rules.
Okay.
What, are we done ?
Question number two...
Are you ready for
the night to be over ?
If your answer to question
number two is "no,"
Remove your goggles
and take your medicine.
Percocet.
Where'd you get these ?
At the party. Your buddy had
them in the medicine cabinet.
So you stole them ?
What's going on in here ?
This area's closed.
Thanks so much, mrs. Skalka.
I couldn't sleep.
Was that because of me ?
Well, i'm home now, sweetie.
No worries.
You know this case
that i'm working on,
Can you tell me anything else
about what you saw ?
Anything at all ?
Because if you're keeping
something from me...
I told you everything.
Don't you believe me ?
Of course i do.
Are you going to work tomorrow ?
Well, honey, it's my job.
Can i go to sleep now ?
Sure.
Here.
Linda.
Have you heard from Kyle ?
No. I would've called you if i had.
I was hoping you'd heard something.
Linda, you two talk all the time.
Yeah, i don't remember any law
against it in the divorce settlement.
Listen, Linda, if you have
any idea where he is...
What, you think i'm holding
something back ?
You're the one with all the secrets.
Look, you're his mother. It makes
sense you'd try to protect him.
In any way i could.
But i thought that's why he was
living with you, wasn't it ?
Protecting him was
supposed to be your specialty.
You want to blame me ? Fine.
Go ahead, but i've got to find Kyle now.
What if he doesn't want
you to find him ?
I think he may be in trouble.
Serious trouble.
Tom, what is it ?
What did he do ?
At least give me a hint.
You don't want to know.
It's like i said...
You're the one
with all the secrets.
Hello ?
Kyle, i just spoke to your father.
You didn't tell him where i was.
You came to me because you didn't want to
go back to NTAC. That's what you said.
Mom, i can't talk to you
about this. I told you.
Well, that's not the whole story, is it ?
Mom, please.
Kyle, tell me what's going on.
Could you excuse me
for a moment ?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Just don't tell me
"i told you so."
Okay, i won't, but i did.
Don't go blaming Danny for any of this.
It was all me, okay ?
The night just got away from me.
I had some beers, and i...
You shouldn't be having beers, Liv.
You shouldn't be having anything.
A month ago, you were an addict.
We can quit the lecture.
I've already packed my bags.
You know, you want to quit,
i can't stop you.
But if you want to stay...
and you can promise me that nothing like this
is ever going to happen again, then please,
enjoy life as a first key.
I'm a second key.
Not anymore.
Mr. Farrell ? Are you going
to be much longer ?
No.
Come in.
So i've...
i've got a bunch o
new songs i've written.
Maybe i can play them
for you sometime.
Yeah. We'll see.
It's not like i know him better
than you, but we do talk.
And he told you where his
secret hiding place was ?
No, but you looked
in all the obvious places,
And Kyle likes his privacy.
Maybe you do know him
better than i do.
No...
I didn't want to believe it, i kept...
I kept hoping i was wrong
about this.
Thomas, this is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold on to that.
okay...
Wait, don't turn around.
Alana,
take this, hide it in the house.
What are you going to do ?
Go back to work.
All right, i want
this area secured.
Garrity, i want a warrant to have these
lockers opened and searched, a. S. A. P.
Well...
Look who came out of retirement.
Good timing, Baldwin.
Your partner can bring you up to speed.
That is, assuming
you intend to stick around.
- I'm here.
- Mm-Hmm.
Well, we do know that two days
before the assassination,
Our man arrived at this station
with a bag full of firearms.
Well, he could've gone
anywhere from here.
Yes, so we're canvassing
all the metro routes,
We're talking to the baggage handlers,
ticket agents, bus drivers...
That sounds right.
Meantime, we just had
a shoeshine guy
I. D. The sketch. He claims he helped
our man make change to buy a locker.
Does he recall which locker ?
He thinks it's in that
group there.
but all the people who use
these lockers in a month...
The odds are, like, 1 in, what, 10,000
we'll turn up anything useful.
Yeah, so why are
we even bothering ?
You never know.
All we need is one print.
Yeah. We can only hope.
I guess.
You okay ?
Maia had another vision.
Now, she says if
we catch this guy,
Someone's going to get hurt.
Did she say who ?
Welcome back.
Is Tom here ?
Uh, no, he isn't.
You must be Alana.
I'm Linda.
I know.
That my interview ?
I don't want to see it.
I know i sucked.
I wouldn't go
so far as "sucked."
But you could do
with more eye contact,
Better enunciation.
But they didn't drag any unnecessary
dirt out of you, and that's something.
I was all distracted. Liv was here right
before, and we got into this thing...
Because you told that junkie
not to go out with your brother.
Ex-junkie.
I'm just trying to protect
her, that's all.
I'm sure that was part of it.
What do you think, i'm jealous of Danny ?
You do realize that a relationship
with this girl is out of the question.
Matthew,
advise me all you want
about the center...
But that's where it stops.
You don't understand, Shawn.
You are the center.
Everything about you,
everything you do.
You cannot afford to have
an inappropriate relationship.
Jordan Collier was all about
inappropriate relationships.
I mean, every girl in this place
was fair game to him.
All the more reason
not to repeat his mistakes.
So what girl is worthy
of the great Shawn Farrell ?
I will let you know
when you meet her.
On to more important things...
I wish i had time
to wipe that locker clean.
Kyle's prints could be all over it.
We've got to find him,
get him out of town.
Out of the country.
You didn't get anything else out of Linda ?
Something she wouldn't tell me ?
No, she's as scared as we are.
I felt guilty lying to her.
The less people who know
the truth, the better.
Still, i know how hopeless she feels.
Her son is missing. She needs answers,
And all she has to go on
is a three-line goodbye note.
Did you tell her about the note ?
No.
She brought it up herself.
I never mentioned it to her.
Kyle...
Dad.
No, Kyle, wait !
Wait !
Goddammit,
- Stop it !
- Let go of me !
Enough !
Enough, Kyle.
Then i have been up on that roof, watching
Collier through the scope, the way the
trigger felt
when i pulled it,
And how his body
twisted before it hit the ground...
I mean, i remember all of it,
But it just feels like
somebody else's memories.
They are.
You weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.
You did not kill Jordan Collier.
I haven't had another blackout since.
You think it's over ?
Let's hope so.
How long do you think
i'll be put away for ?
Kyle, i am not going to let them put you
in prison for something you did not do.
- Do you hear me ?
- Yeah.
I just only wish
you would have
told me about these blackouts
when they first started.
You tried.
I didn't listen.
You know...
It's not a new thing, dad.
I... I know i haven't always
been there for you, Kyle, but i
i thought we had
a pretty good relationship.
We do. It's just,
you know, growing up with a dad who works for
the FBI, NTAC... It can be pretty intense, you know ?
You mean i can be
pretty intense.
You can be scary at times.
If you don't believe me, ask mom.
I don't have to.
I believe you.
I'm sorry, dad.
Me too.
Hey, baby.
- Kyle.
- Hi.
I packed a few things for you.
Anything else you need, we'll get in brussels.
What time is the flight ?
Noon.
All right, we'd better check in at
the airport. We'll be safer there.
Okay, i emailed my friend,
and they'll meet us when we land.
They promised
to take good care of Kyle.
Say goodbye to mom for me, okay ?
- Sure.
- Yeah
I promise to break
the news to her gently.
- I'll come and visit you as soon as i can, Kyle.
- That'd be good.
Okay.
- I love you.
- I love you.
All right.
- Thanks, dad.
- Yeah.
Alana...
Keep a close eye on him, okay ?
I will, Thomas.
I will.
So far, we've found two ounces of hash,
some bootleg dvds,
and three dop kits that belong to people
who shower in the terminal bathrooms.
I'm hoping we find a picture of Collier with a big fat "X"
marked through it, all covered in usable prints.
Yeah.
Is everything okay at home ?
Because if you need to take care
of business, now is a good time.
I can hang with Forensics
i case something turns up.
Thanks. I'll, uh...
I'll stick around here.
Skouris.
When did that happen ?
No. We'll be right there.
That was Jarvis.
She just got a call from metro west.
They arrested a suspect 40 minutes ago,
claim he's our guy.
Roy Keith Marsden.
25, unemployed,
Made threats against Collier
after his uncle joined the 4400 center.
Oh, and get this...
He owned a .50-caliber JHLP-6.
Alana ?
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.
You know, if you're here to give me
grief about Liv, you can forget it.
What happened was
your screw-up, not mine.
You know,
you could've pulled me aside,
Told me she had this drug problem.
I would've backed off.
So
if you're expecting me to apologize
and kiss your robe, you're wasting your time.
I didn't come here for that.
Look, i just don't want
this to become a big thing.
Ok, when we were kids
we used to fight like crazy.
Yeah. All the time.
Yeah, and then the next day, we'd blow it off.
Everything would go back to normal.
Yeah.
Simple as that.
Nothing wrong with simple.
Are you, uh, planning on standing there,
or are you going to help me out here ?
With the car ?
I don't wash cars anymore.
I've got people that do that for me.
- Oh, yeah ?
- Yeah.
Yeah, well, i don't, so...
Grab a sponge.
Oh, see, now...
I should've known
i was going to get wet.
Yeah, attaboy.
Get your hands dirty.
It's been a while, huh ?
Come on.
Hey, sweetie.
Hi.
Look, i know you've
already had dinner,
But what do you say we take
another crack at those brownies ?
Okay.
Great.
So how was your day ?
Pretty good.
Good.
Aren't you going
to ask me about mine ?
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for, and guess what.
Nobody was hurt.
So there's nothing to worry about.
It's all over.
Not yet.

We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> the 4400...
as far as
this department knew,
maia wasn't having
visions anymore.
She was keeping them
secret from me
and writing everything
down in a diary.
It's a subpoena.
What do they want?
Your diary.
Don't reveal
your healing ability,
because if you heal
one of them,
you're going
to have to heal them all.
One day,
all of this will be yours.
The paperwork's been drawn up.
The lawyers know what to do.
Everything's in place.
He had a vision
to save the future,
and now he won't be here
to see us achieve it.
But we will achieve.
 None of this
is real to me either.
This is where they altered us,
gave me the ability
to create the world
we've been living in
for the last eight years.
I love you, thomas.
So, let me see
if i've got this, um, straight.
You two met,
fell in love,
and spent eight years
together
in some kind of...
alternate reality,
and now you're here,
with eight years of love
and marriage under your belts,
in what to us was...
no time at all.
Yeah, that...
that about sums it up.
Yeah.
I'll play along.
But if you two start
calling each other "honeybunny,"
i'm so out of here.
I told you
he'd try, thomas.
How'd you know that?
Well, you might be meeting me
for the first time,
but i know all about you.
You're smart,
your favorite writer
is alan moore,
and your favorite meal
is meatloaf.
But i can't be
exactly the same.
You said there was no 4400,
so that means
no coma, no time lost...
no major problems.
That's right.
You were happy.
Successful.
Meaning what?
Nothing.
We used to talk about
medical school, remember?
Over there,
you went to stanford.
How'd i do?
You graduated
with honors.
You became
a neurologist.
Must have made you proud.
I'm always proud of you.
Right, but "dr. Kyle baldwin"
and that world
you were vacationing in,
it came from your mind,
right?
Actually, it was my mind.
Right,
but you created it
using his memories.
Kyle, i'm just as proud
of what
you've accomplished here.
Prouder.
Hey.
You want to know why
all lawyers are jerks?
Because they spend
a lifetime
reading this crap.
What kind of crap,
specifically?
I'm a pretty good
interpreter.
I have 24 hours
to turn maia's diary over
to ntac,
and not one legal option
to get out of it.
What are you going to do?
Well, what ntac wants,
ntac gets,
but i have a 9-year-old
daughter at home
who's counting on me
to protect her.
Any way i can help?
Yeah, you can slap me
upside the head
for ever mentioning the diary
in the first place.
It didn't save collier's life,
and now it's making mine hell.
How about i just make
some fresh coffee instead?
Oh... thanks.
Yeah.
Do you think
they'll find
the man
who did it?
If, by "they,"
you mean "thomas,"
then yeah, probably.
My dad always gets
his man.
You heading out?
Yes, i have to keep
reminding myself
i don't live here
anymore.
Look, kyle,
your father and i
love each other.
That's great.
There's not enough love
in the world.
But i just met you.
Give me a few days
before i start
calling you "mom," okay?
You've got
one of those already.
I'll settle for being
a good friend...
and i'll keep bribing you
with meatloaf
until you give in.
Oh...
* so long ago, another life *
* i can feel your heart beat *
* it's not a dream
remember us *
* i can see it in your eyes *
* we'll find our place in time *
* our place in time
beyond the sun *
* we'll find our place in time *
* our place in time
to call our own *
Hello, mr. Ross.
Did you have
a good flight?
Yes. Thanks.
Now, would you like me
to show you around,
or do you want
to get some rest?
Neither. Take me
to mr. Farrell.
Yes, sir.
Right this way.
They've
been waiting.
Three days.
Tell publicity
i'm not sure yet.
They're saying
we're past our deadline.
We have to release
this press statement.
This is supposed to be coming
from me?
I don't even understand
half of what it says.
It doesn't sound
like me, lucy.
So change it.
You're the boss.
Oh, and legal
needs signatures now,
or no one gets paid,
including legal.
I can only do one thing
at a time.
So let's start
with the statement.
Why don't you dictate
something to me?
No press statement.
If the press wants to know
what mr. Farrell
is thinking,
they can watch
<i>60 minutes</i>
along with the rest of america.
I've already booked
an exclusive interview
with our new face
of the 4400.
That's all for now.
Thanks.
I'm sorry to just jump in
like that.
I thought you could use a hand.
Matthew ross.
Yes.
Yeah.
What are you doing
in seattle?
I go
where i'm needed.
You've come
to the right place.
It's no coincidence, shawn.
Jordan made it clear
that, in the event of his death,
i was to step up,
front and center,
to help you out.
Well, another in a long line
of plans
that jordan neglected
to share with me.
Huh.
But i'm glad
you're here.
Jordan talked about you a lot...
you're going to need
to hire yourself a new lobbyist.
I'm moving to the home office
for the time being.
Pick any office you want.
You start right away.
Uh, these letters?
Everyone knows i can heal now.
Jordan had every intention
of revealing
your healing ability
to the public,
but he was planning on doing it
in stages.
We don't have
that luxury anymore.
We'll deal with it.
I can't go outside anymore.
There's sick people.
The press,
they follow me everywhere.
And they will
for the rest of your life.
The ground just shifted
under your feet.
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.
This center
is the new lourdes.
Nobody's going to be calling us
a "cult" anymore.
We're turning away people
faster than we can sign them up.
In 10 years,
this movement's going to be
one of the dominant faiths
on the planet.
Stop.
I'm glad things are going
so well, i am,
but a week ago,
i was just some guy trying
to beat the last level of <i>doom.</i>
I wasn't the pope then,
and i'm not the pope now.
Yes, you are,
and you need to start
getting used to it.
The fbi is spearheading
the hunt for the man
who killed jordan collier.
Oh, but we're still in the game,
and ntac is making this collar.
I'm not having someone else
clean up our mess for us.
Then we'd better get moving.
We all know
there's an expiration date
on these manhunts.
Trail starts getting cold
after 48 hours.
I want another look at employee
sign-in sheets
for every office building
and parking garage
within a 10-block radius
of the center.
We've already cross-examined
everyone on those books.
Then we have to look
off the books.
This guy shot a public figure
in broad daylight.
There has to be an eyewitness.
And so far, tom, the only one
who has seen this killer
is you.
Loser.
Pathetic loser.
Sweetie, whatever you do,
never, ever gamble.
It's wrong
and it's stupid.
Then why do you do it?
Because,
unlike your mommy,
your aunt april doesn't
have a steady income.
She's an artist,
and artists
always need cash,
which is where the "stupid" part
comes in,
because i always lose.
So this whole
"see the future" thing,
it doesn't just apply
to earth-shattering events, huh?
Not always.
So, if i were to ask you
which card...
that one.
I'll take this one right here.
Thanks.
Baby girl...
you are my new lucky charm.
I'm pulling you off
the collier case.
What are you
talking about?
We still have half
that neighborhood to canvass.
It's going to have to wait.
At 10:37 a.m.,
pacific standard,
the federal emergency
management agency
sent in a task force
to granite pass, oregon,
population 273,
where there's been
an outbreak
of a lethal, highly contagious,
and as yet unidentified virus.
Airborne?
Mm-hmm. Yeah, likely.
Man-made?
Unknown.
What we do know is,
if you went to sleep
in granite pass last night,
chances are you're filling out
a body bag this morning.
There's only
one resident
that fema hasn't
accounted for yet.
Jean delynn baker,
age 30.
Returnee 0188.
Disappeared in '99.
Divorced. No kids.
Psych profile says
she's a loner.
Things have been
pretty grim for her
since she got back.
Hasn't been able
to hold down a job.
She was unemployed
four times
in the last year.
And now she's the only resident
of granite pass, oregon
who can't be
accounted for.
So we've got two possibilities.
Either she's immune
to this virus,
in which case we could
study her,
look for a cure.
Or else...
she's the carrier.
Either way,
your job is the same.
Use whatever resources you need
and find her.
[Country western playing
on radio]
[Driver]: So, are you
going to tell me
where you're headed?
I never could
stand the sight
of a woman in tears.
I guess that's why
i never got married.
You in some kind
of trouble?
Run off
on your family?
Law on your tail?
Seattle.
I'm going to seattle.
That's a big city.
You want me to just drop you
on the edge of town?
I'm going to the 4400 center.
I've got to get there.
What the hell for?
Are you joining up?
Just get me as close
as you can.
Please.
If you're looking
for salvation,
you're not going
to find it there.
What you want to do
is to give yourself
over...
to your true lord
and savior.
Purification day
is coming.
Signs are everywhere...
pestilence, plagues.
Tell me about it.
I woke up in a town
full of dead people
this morning...
my mother,
my father.
Every...
everyone.
Yeah?
How come you survived?
I think maybe i caused it.
You?
Now i know you're
messing with me.
Okay, go ahead,
laugh at the jesus freak,
but i'm telling you,
the whole world'll be
wiped clean soon enough.
Look, i don't think
you're a freak at all, mister.
Matter of fact,
i believe...
The eyes and fingernails show
only slight discoloration.
Rigor mortis
has barely set in.
What did the autopsies show?
Nothing we have a name for.
Their internal
organisms
are pretty much liquefied.
This thing works fast.
So you just took
your helmet off...
you got a death wish?
This virus gets released,
goes airborne,
then dissipates
within a half-hour.
Seen enough?
Plenty.
So everyone
we're looking at
died this morning
because
they were within
the virus's
original radius?
Yeah, and if they
drove through town
an hour later,
they'd be fine.
That's something,
anyway,
but orson bailey,
trent appelbaum...
when a 4400
manifests an ability,
it can get more intense,
quickly.
Which means that
if jean delynn baker
is transmitting
the virus...
yeah, she might be
just warming up.
 <i>the doctors say</i>
<i>they cannot stop</i>
<i>my cancer from spreading.</i>
<i>and i've worked</i>
<i>hard all my life,</i>
<i>but tuberculosis has</i>
<i>eaten up our life's savings,</i>
<i>and my beloved wife</i>
<i>of four years can barely...</i>
<i>grandma</i>
<i>told me to pray,</i>
<i>so when i saw you</i>
<i>on tv,</i>
<i>i knew</i>
<i>that you would...</i>
<i>help me.</i>
<i>Please.</i>
Shawn?
It's lucy.
You're scheduled
for the new keys
address.
Everybody's waiting.
Shawn?
Yeah, i'm flattered.
I'm just not sure
i can take a job
right now.
Richard's going to be
travelling quite a bit.
The daycare here is first-rate
and completely free.
Well, for one thing,
i'm not sure i'm qualified.
I mean, assistant director
of human resources?
I had my first daughter
right out of college.
You could fit my entire resume
on half a page.
You're a 4400.
That's like an advanced
graduate degree around here.
Besides,
jordan talked about you.
Oh, i'm sure he did.
He said you had
the gift of empathy,
that you were
a natural born organizer,
and that you had a knack
for bringing out
the best in people.
Jordan said that about me?
You're a returnee.
You're smart.
We empower people like you
around here.
Wipe your feet.
A killer airborne virus
has been released,
and you're worried
about muddy footprints?
It's still
somebody's home.
So this is where
jean delynn baker lived.
Until she hit
the road, yeah.
Does she keep a schedule?
Any kind of daily planner?
Yeah, but i think
it went out the window
when she realized
her entire hometown
had been wiped out.
Anyone get in touch
with the parents?
This
is their house.
They were sleeping
upstairs
when the virus hit.
Okay, you guys
aren't leaving this house
until you've been through
everything...
letters, phone bills,
grocery lists.
Marco, listen to me.
Find me a pattern,
the way she thinks.
She's on the run.
I want to beat her
to wherever she's headed.
Flirt.
You heard the man.
4400 center.
How may i direct your call?
<i>I didn't mean</i>
<i>to do it.</i>
I didn't mean to kill them.
I...
these... these blisters,
they itch so bad.
Killed who?
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to help me, please.</i>
Who is this?
I'm a 4400,
and there's something wrong
with me.
<i>Everybody</i>
<i>that i'm around dies,</i>
<i>and i don't know</i>
<i>how to stop it.</i>
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how to stop it.</i>
Tell me your name
and where you are.
How many
people dead?
She said hundreds,
but there's nothing about it
on the news.
Could be
they're trying to keep it quiet,
and there is a 4400
named jean baker?
She said
she's staying
at a motel near
the squirrel hill exit
on the 65.
Get me ntac on the phone.
Yes!
You were right.
Philadelphia creamed 'em.
How much
did you win?
$200 for aunt april.
All because of you,
my little genius.
Now, i'm looking
at chicago versus new york,
even up.
Chicago's the home team,
which gives them some advantage,
but new york
is coming off
a three-game
winning streak.
So, who's your pick?
How much are you betting?
The whole
200 bucks,
which won't win me
enough to retire on,
but a girl's got
to start somewhere.
So, you getting
anything?
Do you like me?
What kind of question is that?
I mean,
like me for myself...
or because i tell you stuff
that's going to happen?
Honey, listen.
I love you
for who you are,
not what you can do.
Always.
Okay?
I'd go with chicago.
Chicago it is.
Now, come on.
Aunt april is going
to take you out for pizza.
Go wash up,
and take your mom's stuff off.
You know she gets
kind of uptight about...
maia.
This is my mother's
engagement ring.
Where did you get this?
I always play with it.
This is a very valuable ring,
which means
it is not
for little girls
to play with.
Now wash good,
or i'll order anchovies.
Go!
Hey.
Hey.
Don't take this the wrong way,
but how'd you get in here?
Your dad gave me a key.
A little early
for dinner, isn't it?
Early for eating.
Not for preparing.
Can you cook?
Sorry, i'm a world-class
brain surgeon,
not a chef.
But i can empty
a grocery bag
with the best
of them, though.
But i have
to warn you,
you're ignoring
the number-one
"rule of dad."
Which is?
The longer and more carefully
you prepare for a family event...
the more likely it is
he won't show.
I guess you do know the man.
Which means i guess
you also know me,
which, i'm sorry,
is really weird.
You have to admit
it's a little strange
for me, too.
We have an eight-year
relationship,
and i have to
keep reminding myself
that it doesn't really exist.
So tell me,
was i, like, number one
in my class in medical school?
What does it matter, kyle?
You're not in competition
with yourself.
I'm just curious.
Well, you keep bringing it up.
It's more than curiosity.
So what if it is?
If you knew there was
some parallel universe
where a better, smarter version
of you was walking around,
how would you feel?
He wasn't better,
and he wasn't smarter.
He was you.
He just had options
i'll never have.
No 4400,
no coma.
He got to go to medical school.
Who says
you don't have that option?
I'm 21.
I'm a freshman in college.
So you started a little late.
You keep thinking
i know two kyles.
I don't. I just know you.
You want
to be a doctor?
I know for a fact
that you can pass your mcats.
Jean baker's in a motel
about 10 miles ahead.
Right now, half of ntac
is headed for that place.
Mortimer and falcone
should be there already.
It's weird, huh?
Responding to a tip
that came from inside
the 4400 center?
Shawn did tell me
he wanted
to cooperate with us.
I guess he meant it.
Excuse me. We're ntac.
We need to get through here.
I'll open it for you.
So what's going on
down there?
Dead trucker.
Looks like
it came on sudden.
Jean delynn baker?
No, no, no.
What are you doing?
I called you for help.
We know.
Come with us.
No, you're scaring me.
Please, stop.
They start to itch
when i get scared.
Please, get away from me!
Oh, god.
H
that trucker died
not more than
three hours ago.
Yeah, and he couldn't
have picked up jean
more than two hours
before that.
Which means
he was exposed, infected,
and killed within,
what, 120 minutes.
That's faster
than any virus
i've ever seen.
Mortimer and falcone.
Looks like
we're playing backup.
Baldwin.
[Jean]: <i>it's not my fault.</i>
Who is this?
<i>I called you for help.</i>
You tossed tear gas
into my room!
Jean baker?
How did you get
mortimer's phone?
<i>How do you think i got it?</i>
They scared me.
They... they came barging in
to my room.
What did you do
to them?
<i>I guess you thought</i>
<i>those suits they had on</i>
<i>would keep them safe, huh?</i>
<i>Well, you were wrong, okay?</i>
Nobody's safe.
That's why i'm warning you.
You stay away from me, okay.
Just keep everyone away.
Where are you?
<i>I'm driving.</i>
I think
she took their car.
Call jarvis.
Get a bead on it.
Jean, tell me
where you are,
where you're going.
We want to help you.
<i>No. I tried that.</i>
No one can help me.
No one ever could.
Why should it be
any different now?
I know you don't want
to kill anyone,
but listen to me,
this virus that's
growing inside you,
it's incredibly lethal.
I've always been toxic.
I poisoned every relationship
i ever had.
This is different.
Yes, they made it real.
<i>My parents always said</i>
<i>i was a walking disaster.</i>
They never got to see
how right they were.
<i>Jean, it doesn't have</i>
<i>to be like that.</i>
If you want this
to be over,
it can be.
Just find a deserted
spot, pull over,
and wait for us
to come to you.
<i>I don't need you.</i>
I'm taking care of it myself.
What are you
going to do?
I'm going to end this
before i kill anyone else.
End what?
This phone call, this day,
everything.
No, jean, just wait.
Hold on. Listen to me.
Goodbye, baldwin.
She says she's going
to kill herself.
Well, i'm not sure
that's a solution.
It could trigger
another release of the virus.
Do we have a fix on her?
Yeah, she's driving west
on the 99.
Jarvis has got three
helicopters in the air.
If she doesn't pull over,
there's orders
to incinerate.
Vacation?
For how long?
A month, maybe two.
I don't know.
You think that's what
the center, the movement,
needs right now?
I don't know, matthew,
but i'm damn sure
it's what i need
right now.
I think you're going
to have to settle
for a long weekend.
I hear puget sound
is nice.
Okay, you're not hearing me.
I'm ignoring you.
There's a difference.
Listen.
I'm not saying
i can't do this.
I will lead this movement.
But jordan just died,
and i need some time
to get my head around that.
You're going to have to grieve
on the run
like the rest of us.
It's called being a grownup.
Don't lecture me
about my responsibilities.
You just got here,
and if this place needs me
the way that you keep
saying that it does,
then it's going to have
to work around me sometimes.
Work around you?
We can do that.
Mary o'connell.
Taken 1972.
Very promising empath.
Robert fields,
1987.
Genius with numbers
and pattern recognition.
John gersten...
who are these people?
Replacements, potentially.
None of them make
the slam dunk you would,
but i'm ready
to move this center forward,
with you or otherwise.
Jordan used to talk to me
that way sometimes.
He was great at getting me
to see things his way.
You?
You're not quite there yet.
Your healing power
makes you unique.
Jordan knew it.
I believed it.
I came here to work with you,
but you're asking me
to work around you,
and that i can't do.
Then you are going
to have to spend
some quality time
with that list,
because i'm leaving.
I'm sure you won't
miss a beat, though.
I know there's a huge demand
for pattern recognition.
Th-th-that's impossible.
Mortimer and falcone
were wearing
state-of-the-art
biohazard gear.
That stuff's engineered
to withstand an anthrax attack.
They're dead, marco.
Obviously, whatever
she's releasing
is a little craftier
than the anthrax virus.
If it got through those suits,
that means the antigen's
operating on a subatomic level.
Which basically
makes it unstoppable.
<i>Yeah, pretty much.</i>
Jean told me mortimer
and falcone scared her
when they came
into her room.
Is it possible
the release of this virus
is connected
to her emotional state?
Yeah, more than possible,
it's likely.
Her medicine cabinet
is basically a neon sign
flashing "borderline
personality disorder."
<i>She's got cortisone creams</i>
<i>for stress rashes,</i>
<i>an assortment</i>
of your finer
psychopharmaceuticals...
xanax, prozac...
<i>yeah,</i>
<i>we get it, marco.</i>
<i>She's a wreck.</i>
A wreck whose body acts
as a delivery system
for the virus she's producing...
the same way
flowers release pollen.
What, she's emitting
spores?
<i>Something like that.</i>
<i>Look, spores are just</i>
reproductive bodies
released by a vascular system.
The human body
is one big vascular system.
It runs on blood flow.
Yeah, which can
speed up or slow down,
depending on moods,
feelings.
Right, so when jean's blood
gets going...
when she's angry,
confused, upset, whatever...
a killer virus goes airborne.
We're not far
from her car now, marco.
Any advice on how
to deal with her?
Uh... don't piss her off?
Hey.
Hi.
How are you, lily?
Good.
I heard, um,
you're leaving for a while.
That was fast.
Anyway, yeah, i don't know
how long i'm going to be gone.
What are you going to do?
For starters, i'm going to
disappear for a while,
and then, um, i don't know,
who knows?
I mean, i don't have
to work here
to make people healthy,
so i guess i could go anywhere.
So you're just
going to kind of roam the earth,
kung fu style?
I'm not going to shave my head
and wear a robe,
but... something like that,
i guess.
Well, you could take these
with you,
check out
the return address...
stop off
in gloucester, massachusetts,
do a quick healing,
and then go on your way.
You know about the letters?
Oh, shawn,
they're everywhere.
Yeah, each one sadder
than the next.
It's too much to take, almost.
It did give me
an idea, though,
but, you know, you're leaving,
so we'll talk it over
when you get back.
No, lily, i mean...
like i said, i don't know when
that's going to be, so, please,
i would love to hear
what you have to say.
All right, well,
i was thinking...
i mean, we're not
a hospital,
and we're not
a charity,
and still, thousands
of these requests
keep pouring in
every day.
I mean, no wonder
you feel overwhelmed.
We're not set up
to handle it.
Yes, exactly.
That's why
i've got to get out of here.
What if we set up a foundation?
Part of this place,
but separate.
Hire a staff
whose only job
is to open
these letters
and find the neediest cases,
people that we can help
that no one else can.
But that is still saying no
to thousands of people.
Well, that's right, shawn,
but what if we can say yes
to one?
I mean, you heal
one person a day,
every day.
That's a big job, though...
deciding who deserves it most.
Well, so you form a committee,
and you load it up
with doctors and social workers.
And you.
Oh. Well...
come on, i mean,
it's your idea.
You should at least be there
to help make it happen.
Yeah, i just took a job
at human resources.
I think i could probably
get you transferred.
Did you find a body
in there?
Can't get
close enough yet.
As soon as you can,
we need to retrieve it.
Well, she said
she wanted to end it.
I guess we could send
marco and his boys
back down
to the basement,
let 'em find
a ripple effect
on this one.
Excuse me.
Baldwin.
<i>I came close,</i>
<i>but i don't know...</i>
jean?
I couldn't go through with it.
That's good.
Nobody wants you dead.
Just tell me where you are.
<i>No. You can't</i>
<i>help me.</i>
The 4400 center can't help me,
but it doesn't matter.
I finally know
where i'm supposed to go.
Tell me where.
I'll meet you
there.
You ever read
the <i>bible,</i> baldwin?
I went to sunday school.
<i>I spent some time</i>
<i>with it earlier today,</i>
<i>back at that motel.</i>
"The time is at hand."
That's "revelations," right?
<i>But do you know</i>
<i>what it means?</i>
<i>I bet you don't.</i>
See, these blisters...
they form on my hands.
Do you get it?
I'm not sure i do, jean.
<i>They're talking</i>
<i>about me in that book.</i>
You got family?
Jean, what are you
talking about?
<i>Go to them.</i>
Hug them real tight.
<i>I've finally</i>
<i>figured it out,</i>
<i>why they</i>
<i>sent me back.</i>
I'm part of their plan.
They want me to do this.
Do what?
Purify humanity.
She was quoting "revelations?"
Never a good sign, tom.
She's gone
from wanting to help,
wanting to stop
all of this,
to believing she's
the end of the world,
so what does she do?
She said they want her
to do this, right?
Well, that implies
it's out of her hands.
Destiny.
She's giving up
responsibility.
Yeah, that's one way
to deal with being
a walking plague...
pretend the decision's
out of your hands.
I don't think
she wants to even
think about it
anymore.
I think she just
wants it over.
Well,
that's her mindset.
It still doesn't tell us
where she's going.
She's on
autopilot, tom.
My best guess?
She does whatever
she planned on doing
before the bodies
started rolling.
Right.
[Cellphone ringing]
Marco.
Today's tuesday, right?
<i>It's wednesday,</i>
<i>marco.</i>
My bad.
She's only got one thing
written down for the day.
She's filing
her unemployment claim
in downtown portland.
Son of a bitch!
I don't believe it.
Am i dreaming,
or did you not tell me
that chicago would win?
Do you know
what i bet?
$200.
Try my mother's
diamond engagement ring,
and now it's gone,
all because i believed in you,
trusted you,
and you let me down.
You lied to me.
You said winning
didn't matter.
You said you liked me anyway.
Oh, so you knew chicago
would lose, didn't you?
Right from the jump,
this was all just a test.
A foundation?
Don't you think
we have our hands
full already?
It's one person a day.
Once it's up
and running,
it's not really going
to eat into my time.
I thought you were
looking for privacy.
You do this,
you're stepping into
a white-hot spotlight.
Yes, but it's
on my terms.
Be good publicity.
Not too hard
to get off the ground.
We could get
some huge names
for that
filtering committee.
I think
it's a good idea.
Well, i'm glad
that you approve,
but i wasn't really asking
for your permission.
I would hope not.
Jean.
Baldwin?
That's right.
You should've stayed away.
Look around you.
All these people, they haven't
done anything to hurt you.
They haven't done anything
to help me, either.
Besides,
it doesn't matter.
I don't have a choice.
I am doing
what they wanted me to do.
 You don't have
to accept that.
You have a choice.
Yeah, like i had a choice
when i was abducted.
I never had a choice.
Ever.
They have
the right girl
for the job.
What are you doing
here, anyway?
You should have gone
back to your family,
like i said.
No. I'm right where
i want to be.
Then you must have
some kind of death wish.
You think you're here
to kill people.
I think i'm here to stop you.
They infected you, jean,
and that was wrong,
but you don't have to let them
make you into a mass murderer.
I'm already a killer.
No. No.
You haven't decided
to kill anyone.
That's what you're doing
right now.
Whatever
you're thinking
about destiny or fate,
whatever...
you're wrong.
You don't have to do this.
You don't.
Want to hear
something funny?
I... i believe you.
But it's too late.
Oh...
they're so ripe.
I can't stop it now.
They itch so bad.
They do.
Hell of a day.
How are you holding up?
Well...
i'm scheduled
for psychiatric
counseling on monday.
Saved thousands
of innocent people,
had to shoot a woman
to do it...
you did what you had to do.
Anyway, uh,
not sure if this
is a good time,
but i made you
a little something.
It's kind of a...
well, a fake version
of maia's diary.
Should fool
just about anybody.
You forged this
to get ntac off my back?
I know
it's a big thing,
but you were kind of
over a barrel, so...
this could get me
into a lot of trouble.
This could get you
in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, uh...
you don't
have to use it
if you don't want to.
Just giving you
an option.
This is insane.
It's also maybe one
of the nicest things
anybody's ever done
for me.
I want to thank you
for a job well done.
You must have been
very persuasive.
I just said what i thought.
Your idea for a foundation
was terrific.
You mean your idea, don't you?
Do we have to be
all cloak-and-dagger
about it?
You and shawn
both got what you wanted,
and a lot of sick people
are going to get help.
Well, you did a lot of good
for the center today,
and i'm not going to forget it.
Hey, matthew,
you know what the center
means to me?
What?
Free rent and daycare
for my daughter.
I'm not
an 18-year-old kid.
I don't need to discover
the magic power inside of me.
So, in other words...
you're not a true believer?
Is that a problem?
Not at all.
Neither am i.
You look wiped.
Yeah. Don't ask.
You didn't
have to do this.
Well, i didn't.
Your son's the cook.
Kyle?
I bet he had
a little help.
Well, you know,
we got to talking.
It was nice.
How was your day, alana?
Well, i bought
these pieces
from this young artist,
this girl from bed-stuy,
self-taught,
and she painted
this little
scrap of garden
in her backyard,
and it's night,
and the sky
is so rich and deep...
You okay?
More or less.
Bet you almost forgot.
No, i didn't,
but i thought,
in light of today's events,
i would give you
a little extension.
Well, it's not necessary.
It's a hot read.
Lots of good stuff
about spongebob.
Thank you.
<i>the national</i>

We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> the 4400...
this is where
i give you the speech
about how you're
my best field scientist
and tom is my best
lead investigator,
and how together,
you're going to make
a good team.
Let me see
if i've got this straight...
you two met,
fell in love,
and spent eight years together
in some kind
of alternate reality.
Yeah.
What time is the flight?
Uh, noon.
Say goodbye to mom for me.
They arrested a suspect
40 minutes ago.
Claim he's our guy.
[Jarvis]: Roy keith marsden.
Forget about the flight.
Bring kyle home.
They just arrested a suspect
in the collier killing.
It's going to feel
a little weird,
but when we're done,
you'll be able
to see again.
When does it start?
When do i see again?
Just give me one moment, okay?
Kevin's a genius, you know.
You're saying that burkhoff
is the father
of the 4400 technology.
I can think again, too.
You've got
a real fever,
young lady.
I worked at the c.d.c.
For seven years,
and i never saw
anything like it.
I was changing her.
She has these marks on her skin.
Marks? Bruises?
No. Like irritations.
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.
What did i just tell you?
[Jarvis]: You're in charge
until i'm released.
Pool whatever manpower
is still up walking.
Start picking up the pieces.
I'll handle it.
Don't worry about it.
[Tom]:
Okay, seriously,
my back is about
to call it a day.
Just come on...
you're not helping.
Where's this going?
Right there.
Please say
that was the last box.
That's it.
We're officially
living in sin.
Oh, really.
Well, i prefer to call it
"resuming
our eight-year marriage."
Call it whatever you want.
Just don't kiss
in front of me again, okay?
That's disgusting.
Oh, your father thinks
this is so romantic,
but what
he doesn't know
is the reason
i'm moving in
is to take down
his tacky golf stuff.
[Tom]: What?
And replace it
with what?
Oh, oh,
paint splatters?
Maybe a picture
of a triangle
kids!
It's art.
Work out
these decorating issues
amongst yourselves,
but i'm dead serious
about this kissing rule, okay?
It's non-negotiable.
Oh, kyle,
my allergies are
bothering me again.
Could you write me
another prescription
before you go?
Uh, alana...
kyle's only a doctor
in the world you created for me,
remember?
I'm sorry.
I had a brain freeze.
Right.
Trying to decipher
my handwriting?
I was just on the verge
of giving up, actually.
Good.
Bad penmanship
is the best way
for a doctor to keep
his mystique.
There's a page missing
in there.
It goes from page four
to page six.
Sorry.
I'm breaking in a new nurse.
So listen, i think
we finally know
what's wrong
with your daughter.
Maia's suffering
from a type of pneumonia
called pneumocystis jiroveci.
It's "p.j.p."
For short.
I've never heard of it.
It's rare,
but we can treat it...
well, thank god.
But this kind
of pneumonia
could be a symptom
for something more serious.
We've tested her
for every virus...
all negative.
So where is it coming from?
We don't know,
but we're running more tests.
We'll figure it out.
It's not that big
of a deal.
You know, i've just...
i've been working
real hard lately.
I think i got the flu
or something.
Everybody gets that,
right?
Sure. It's just...
shawn...
you can't heal.
For now.
I think you should
get it checked out.
If i can't kick it
in a day or two, i will,
but, uh...
until then,
can you reschedule
all my foundation
appointments?
Tell them that it's temporary.
Make sure they know that.
Lily...
don't tell anyone
i can't heal.
Sure.
Thank you.
Lily...
i mean it. Nobody.
Oh, god.
Ah...
[Speaking german]
[Tom]: How many
are sick?
300... that we know of.
Medical says
more calls keep coming in.
So, what is it?
Well, it's some kind
of immune system disorder,
and it's leaving the 4400
vulnerable
to all kinds of diseases.
His plane landed
at seatac
on schedule.
Chopper should be here
any minute.
What's that?
They told me
he likes green tea.
Is it contagious?
We don't know.
Were they infected
while they were gone?
Maybe they brought this
back with them.
Well, maybe.
We just don't know.
The situation is fluid,
but here's a summary
of what we know so far.
Uh, sir?
They told me
you'd want this.
The numbers just keep
getting bigger.
So we're recovering
from an attack
on this building...
the division commander's
still in the hospital...
what are we
supposed to do?
We take to the field.
Ryland?
Where did he
come from?
We're going to have
every 4400 in this jurisdiction
tested
for this sickness
by day's end.
Dennis, is it good to see you.
Tom.
Diana.
What brings you
to seattle, ryland?
I'm assuming temporary command
of this division.
My orders are to do something
about the spread
of this epidemic.
I'm going to figure out a way
to do just that.
* so long ago, another life *
* i can feel your heart beat *
* it's not a dream
remember us *
* i can see it in your eyes *
* we'll find our place in time *
* our place in time
beyond the sun *
* we'll find our place in time *
* our place in time
to call our own *
You might want
to move that,
unless you want people
calling you "nina."
How's jarvis doing?
They set her collarbone.
Doctors said
she'll be back in two weeks.
My guess?
She makes it in one.
Yeah.
So how's d.c.?
Oh, it's a lot of networking.
Lots of dinner parties.
Patty loves it.
And you?
The pacific northwest
is the flashpoint.
I kind of feel
like i was promoted
out of the game.
A lot of guys here
would trade places with you.
I wouldn't blame them.
A woman releases plague
into the air?
A terrorist attack
on the building?
Some people i work for
think you're
in the middle of a war.
I'm sure
it looks that way on paper.
Don't get defensive.
I'm still preaching the gospel
of highland beach.
I still believe
the 4400 came back here
to change things for the better.
Yeah, and the people
you work for?
Don't worry
about them.
One day, this'll be over,
we'll go out for a beer,
we'll kick back,
we'll trade war stories.
Yeah.
[Ruth]: She was a little cranky
this morning.
I think
she's cutting another tooth.
They're
coming in fast, huh?
She's that age.
Bye, bye, sweetie.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you, ruth.
Lily, what are you doing?
I thought we agreed
nobody was doing
science experiments on our baby.
Just making sure.
Shawn, we need to rearrange
your healing schedule.
There's something going on,
some sort of illness
spreading among the 4400.
I know all about it.
You.
Did you do this?
No, no. It wasn't me.
Then what are you doing here?
I read about this place
in the paper.
I just... i was curious.
Yeah?
Well, go be curious
somewhere else,
because people
still live here, okay?
Do you need some help?
What, are you
a mechanic now?
I can change a tire.
There's probably a jack
in the trunk, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry i snapped at you.
I just... i'm in a hurry, and...
my boyfriend's little brother
is in the principal's office
again,
and he's... not here...
again.
I guess he's in
a lot of trouble, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.
Well, i mean,
it's none of my business.
I can just change the tire
and go.
Please.
Hi there.
Welcome to the center.
Are you here to take the tour?
This is wrong.
It's all wrong.
Excuse me?
This is
the collier museum.
Where are
all the paintings?
Thomas.
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?
I have a board of directors
meeting,
and they won't let me
go upstairs.
Yeah, yeah.
They called me.
They said you were
a little mixed up.
Alana...
this isn't
the collier museum.
It's...
it's the 4400 center.
What are you
talking about?
I come here
all the time.
Look at me. Look...
alana...
the place
you're thinking of,
it's somewhere else.
No. No!
Why are you
confusing me?
Just calm down!
No!
It's okay.
It's all right.
[Ryland]:
The infection rate is 18%.
One in five of them
are already sick?
One in five today.
Tomorrow...
the national
institute of health
is worried that this illness,
whatever it is,
can mutate
and cross over
into the general
population.
Would it even
have to mutate?
There's
no guarantee
that this is going to
stay exclusive to 4400s
and meanwhile,
we've got two dozen sick ones
right downstairs.
They're not going to
be there long.
Why?
What are we doing with them?
D.c. Wants to put all the 4400
back in quarantine
and keep them there
for the rest
of the crisis.
I know it's a big move, people,
but it's the best one we've got
at the moment.
Can we do that?
According to emergency
quarantine order 74,
we can.
But wait,
you're just talking
about the sick ones here,
right?
No. All of them.
Every 4400
in the country
is subject to this order.
Okay,
but that's only half of them.
This thing's worldwide, right?
England and france
are passing similar legislation.
We expect
other countries to follow.
But why are you forcing them all
to come in?
Because the disease seems to be
showing up at random.
Until we understand
how it's transmitted,
we have to assume
that every 4400
is a potential vector.
How much time
are we giving them?
We'll make
the announcement
in the morning.
They'll have 12 hours
to get to a local
ntac branch,
then they'll be
transferred
to camp dekker
and the quarantine facility.
What if they don't report?
Then it'll be our job
to bring them in.
You're not hearing me...
it's temporary.
Can you be sure?
You already told me
people in washington
think we're
fighting a war.
Washington is
full of opinions.
The town runs on them.
The 4400
aren't just names
in some report...
and they're definitely
not enemy combatants.
You're talking
about my daughter,
tom's nephew...
the woman i love.
I was going to tell you
over that beer.
[Diana]: Now,
what assurances
can you give us
that these people
aren't just being
thrown down some hole
permanently?
You have my assurance,
and that should be
enough.
I was the one who pushed
to let them out
in the first place,
you remember?
We're not trying
to second-guess you, dennis,
but people we love are sick.
I get it,
but getting them all
together in one place
is going to make it
a lot easier
to find out
what the hell this is.
When it's over,
everybody goes home.
We know you'll
fight the good fight, dennis.
I just hope you can win.
Mommy?
You're awake.
How are you, baby?
I'm tired of being sick.
When can i go home?
Why don't you tell me?
I was kind of hoping
you'd had a vision,
about how all this
will be over soon.
They're not coming
anymore.
I'm not seeing things.
My favorite patient
is awake.
More awake than you look.
Mm.
Open wide.
I do my best work
when i eliminate sleep
altogether.
Well, if you need someone
to splash cold water
on your face,
you just let me know.
Thanks.
Do you mind?
I noticed that missing page
made its way back in.
Oh. Yeah.
I told you it'd be back.
What are those two lines
blacked out for?
Well, looks like
we duplicated a test.
They cross it out
so we don't read
the same results twice.
Okay, let's see
how that rash is doing.
[Lily]: I'm fine, brian.
Tell heidi not to worry.
Richard's fine.
Isabelle's fine.
Well, the news
is making it sound
like everybody's sick.
People are terrified,
and if normal people
start getting sick...
"normal people"?
Okay, that
came out wrong,
but you know
what i mean.
And listen, lily,
heidi's not the only one
that's worried about you.
I am, too.
A year and a half ago,
you welcomed me home
with a restraining order.
I know.
I panicked when you got back.
Don't think i haven't lost sleep
over what i did.
I just want you
to know now
that i'm there for you.
You, richard, isabelle.
You need anything...
just call.
"Quarantine."
That's an evocative word
these days.
Conjures up images
of secret prisons and...
what's the euphemism
you're using now?
"Coercion tactics"?
[Tom]: Let me
ask you something...
you have some doctors
on staff here, right?
Yes.
They having any luck
getting to the bottom
of this thing?
Not yet.
Then get off
your soapbox.
You want an image
to hold on to?
Try this one...
4400s dying in droves.
I think what my partner
means to say
is that our
two organizations
need each other.
We should cooperate.
And how exactly
do we do that?
We want you to issue
a public statement.
If the center
counsels the 4400s
to go along
with this order,
things will go
much more smoothly.
And if we don't?
Why are we talking
to you, anyway?
Where's shawn?
Is he all right?
Mr. Farrell
is handling urgent business.
This situation requires
his full attention.
Look, i'll have to
run it by him,
but i don't see a problem
advising any ill 4400s
to seek medical care
from ntac.
Well, that's a start.
What about the ones
who aren't
showing symptoms?
That issue's going to require
a little more thought.
Great.
You have 12 hours.
[Teenage boy]:
What's the point
of painting it over,
anyway?
They're just gonna
do it again.
We don't know that.
Look, sam,
kyle has been nice enough
to come over here
and help us out,
so the least that you can do
is pitch in.
Oh, yes, very good...
picasso.
I'm going to make sandwiches.
Okay, seriously,
what's your story?
Why are you helping us,
kyle whoever-you-are?
My last name's bingham...
and i don't know.
I was just walking by here
yesterday.
Alison looked
like she could use a hand...
yeah, well,
if you were thinking
about hooking up with her,
forget it.
Alison's gonna
marry my brother
as soon as he gets out of jail.
I know. I know.
She told me.
You should listen to her.
Roy didn't kill
this collier guy.
I believe you.
Yeah?
Well, you're the only one.
You and me.
When he does get out,
i don't think
you want him coming home
and seeing "murderer"
written all over his door,
do you?
Richard...
you ready for a promotion?
Me?
A promotion to what?
I'm trying here, man.
I want to lead us all
through this,
but i can't do that right now.
Thank you.
I know i'm a 4400,
but after that,
my qualifications
are a little thin.
They didn't even give me
an ability.
To be honest with you,
i'm not sure how long
lily and i were planning
on staying here.
So it's not a perfect fit,
but you're articulate,
and a war hero,
and you have
the gravitas
of a leader.
I think
it's a good idea.
I haven't given an order
since 1951.
I was in high school
a year and a half ago.
I managed.
So will you.
But it's only temporary, right?
As soon as you get better,
i can go right back
to being camera-shy.
Yeah.
Temporary.
What are you going to do?
What i have to.
Has everyone frightened,
and that's understandable.
But no one's more frightened
than we are.
And that's because,
in spite of all the rumors
that you hear flying around,
only 4400s
are getting sick,
and now the government
wants us to head
into quarantine.
They say cooperation
is essential.
Well, here's
the best we can do...
<i>if you're sick,</i>
<i>the responsible thing</i>
<i>is to report to ntac.</i>
<i>Our best wishes</i>
<i>and prayers</i>
<i>go with you.</i>
But if you're well,
if you're showing no symptoms,
we ask you to consider this...
walking into quarantine
is an easy step,
but walking out...
that might be
considerably more difficult.
<i>Thank you.</i>
Don't they get it?
We're trying
to help these people.
All they hear is
"quarantine," dennis.
You can't blame them
for being scared.
Maybe if we give them
another day,
half a day, even.
Does it look to you
like they haven't
made up their minds?
We tried
being reasonable.
In 10 hours,
we start rounding them up.
Hi.
Hey.
I know who you are.
You're the one
who fixes people.
Yeah. Shawn.
How come you're in here?
Why don't you just
make yourself better?
I wish i could.
They're broken.
Kind of like
the rest of me.
I used to see things.
Stuff that was
gonna happen.
That's gone now too.
It's funny, huh?
When i found out
i was different,
all i wanted to do
was be normal again.
Me too.
But you
get used to it.
Now that it's gone,
i feel like i'm missing an arm.
It'll come back.
Once we get better.
Any idea when that's gonna be?
Not exactly,
but my mom told me
everything's gonna be fine,
and i believe what she says.
That must be a nice feeling.
Don't you have someone
to believe in?
I used to...
but now i guess
i'm just going to have to
believe in you.
You're the one
i attacked
at the hospital.
We didn't think
you'd remember us.
I remember.
I was...
very sick back then.
I'm better now.
Diana, you wanted
to see me?
Kevin burkhoff.
I've been doing
neurological research
on the 4400.
Oh, i've heard of you.
Everybody here has.
Here.
There's some very
interesting data
on the blood work
i've been doing.
Have a look.
See if it helps you figure out
what's going on
with this disease.
Well, thank you.
I'll comb
through this.
Good,
and i can expect
to see your work... when?
I showed you mine.
You show me yours.
That is the way
it works,
isn't it?
Usually,
but the research we do here
is classified.
[Diana]: Max...
max, if ever
there was a time
to bend the rules
a little,
i think
it might be now.
Well, it's not
a wink-and-a-nudge situation.
I give over
classified documents,
i go to jail.
Yeah, and if you don't,
people might die.
Are you implying we're not doing
everything we can?
We've got dozens
of doctors
working
around the clock
to try to solve this thing.
Now, i will look over
everything that you've given me.
If i find anything
that can help you,
i'll give you a call.
That's the best i can do.
I am so sorry...
i'm not interested
in apologies.
I want to see
that information.
Or is ntac not interested
in curing these people?
I know you guys
are kind of cavalier
about putting your own careers
on the line,
but do me a favor...
stop asking me
to join in the fun, okay?
I like what i do here.
They're medical records, marco.
Not national secrets.
Wrong.
They're medical records
and national secrets.
That is why they keep them
in a database
you need six passwords
to get into,
and that's why sport-o
wouldn't give them to you.
Let's just leave max
out of this.
He's under a lot of pressure.
And he wants
to keep his job.
I don't blame him.
You know, i just
opened a 401(k).
Yeah, pretty sure
the government stops
matching donations
once you commit treason.
The government
just turned down
an offer of help
from kevin burkhoff.
Remember him?
Yeah, the future
built a giant tower
to wake him up.
I guess they think he matters.
If anyone in washington
read my report,
they know
he matters, too.
You know, it's weird.
Hundreds of people are sick.
You'd think they'd want
any help they could get.
Well, they're going to
get his help.
Yeah, whether they want it
or not.
Gotcha.
Yeah.
Is isabelle ready
to go for her walk?
Okay, let's go have some fun.
How long has she
been in there?
I don't know.
Five minutes.
I came and got you
as soon as i saw.
What are they
doing to her in there?
Step back.
[Matthew]: Would you
excuse us, please?
How long has this been going on?
Richard, your daughter
has never been
in any kind of danger.
He asked you a question.
Jordan was going to
initiate these tests
as soon as he convinced you
to come back into the fold...
what tests?
What have you been doing to her?
All we're doing
is what you should have done
a long time ago...
trying to figure out who,
or what, isabelle is.
She's our daughter.
That's all you
or anyone else
your daughter
is the rosetta stone
for understanding
what happened to the 4400,
yet you both cling
to the illusion
that she's going to go
to preschool,
first communion, the prom...
she's not communal property.
We're her parents. We decide.
Parents?
You are the stewards
of the future,
and forgive me for saying so,
but you're doing
a piss-poor job of it.
We have given up
everything we have
for that child,
any chance we had
of living a normal life,
to protect her
from people like you.
Look, richard, this is no time
for this conversation.
In two hours,
the government is
coming through the front door.
Yeah, well,
you won't use my daughter
as some kind of weapon
against them.
That was never my intention.
You'll never have the chance.
We're leaving right now.
That's your choice,
but if you do,
if we splinter now,
they will round up the 4400
one by one,
Hey.
Hey, thomas.
Hey.
They said
you've been asking for me.
Shouldn't you be in bed?
They'll take me back
soon enough.
I wanted to see you.
How do you feel, baby?
They can't get the fever down,
but...
the worst part is my head.
Everything's so mixed up.
This illness,
it affects people's abilities.
Maia can't see things, and...
and shawn, shawn can't heal,
and for you, honey,
i think the boundaries
between this world
and the one you created
are breaking down.
It's so confusing.
I don't know
what's real anymore.
I know it's scary.
You just have to hang on.
They'll get this fixed.
What if they're too late?
What if they can
make my body right,
but not my mind?
I don't want to live like that,
thomas.
You're not
going to have to.
You're going to get better.
You have to believe that, alana.
Thomas...
yeah?
I love you so much.
I wanted us to get married
for real,
in this world.
That's all i wanted to tell you,
before...
before my mind goes...
because...
i don't know
if it will be good again.
So you're sure i can't get you
a beer or something?
No, no,
that's okay.
I don't drink.
Okay.
You know, this isn't
really necessary.
I just did
a couple of chores.
Maybe it's not a big deal
to you,
but i just haven't seen
a friendly face
in a while,
not since... roy went away.
no offense, but, um...
the papers make him sound
like the second coming
of lee harvey oswald.
Yeah.
Well, i wouldn't exactly call it
"fair and balanced coverage."
But he did have
some monstrous gun collection,
right?
Look, i'm not saying
that he was a candidate
for higher office,
and...
he sure as hell
wasn't the world's
greatest boyfriend.
But taking out
two ntac agents
and shooting jordan collier?
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Eat up.
Sam!
Sam, come on!
We're starting.
I'll be right there.
Hey.
Okay.
Are you marco?
Thanks.
Don't thank me.
Hire me.
I'm gonna need a job.
Where have you been?
Talking to matthew.
Lily...
he's got an idea
on how to handle
this roundup.
I think it might work.
I'm sure
he's full of clever ideas.
We will deal with
what matthew did,
but not now.
The government is about
to declare martial law
we don't have time to squabble.
All i want to hear
is that you're done
with this place for good.
It's not that simple.
We can't just go off
and hide in the woods somewhere.
It's not going to work
this time.
The center betrayed us.
They betrayed our daughter.
And they learned
about her,
more than we did
in almost a year.
Lily, stop.
Did you know
isabelle has connections
between the right and left
hemispheres of her brain
that have never been
seen before?
Even if that's true, richard...
it's not that they studied her.
It's how they did it.
Do you trust
the government?
Because
if we go into quarantine,
isabelle will end up
right here,
or with them,
and if they find out
what she can do...
we'll lose her forever.
[Ryland]: That's it.
That's the deadline.
Where do we start?
I want everybody
to holster their pistols.
My goal is to do this quietly,
peacefully,
and without incident.
What if they want
an incident?
Then we'll give them one.
Is everybody ready?
<i>Affirmative, sir.</i>
<i>We're in position.</i>
Let's go.
Moving in now.
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>They're on the move.</i>
They're
spreading out
and letting us
through.
Welcome to the center.
Did you come for the tour?
You know damn well
why we're here.
Out hunting, i'd guess.
Well, i'm afraid
you've come to the wrong place.
You are welcome to look around,
????????
?????
I have no idea
where they went.
You had 1204400s
taking shelter at your center.
That sounds about right.
I don't have an exact figure.
You just came
downstairs,
and they were gone?
Until 7:00 this evening,
they were free citizens.
I had no reason
to track
their movements,
and since i've broken no laws,
unless you want to talk about
lifting this quarantine order,
we have nothing left to discuss.
We'll talk again.
I suspect your job
is going to get rather ugly
from here on out,
kicking in doors
and such.
If i worked at ntac,
i might spend a little less time
trying to find missing 4400s,
and a little more
trying to cure the ones i had.
So tell me,
have we got a list
yeah.
All the sick ones we know of
are in.
As for the rest,
we had about 75% compliance.
Nationwide,
there's about 5204400s
unaccounted for.
Well, that's not a few holdouts.
That's an insurgency.
So this is it, huh?
Us against them.
You know, it feels
kind of like the war
jordan collier always predicted.
Predicted or provoked?
We declared martial law on them.
We had no option.
I'm going to pursue
a policy of non-aggression
as long as i can,
but if it comes down
to a choice
between the safety
of the american people
and the welfare
of the 4400,
tom...
that's no choice at all.
[Richard]: Collier left behind
37 safe houses
throughout the country.
We liquidated the center's
emergency slush fund
should last for awhile.
Any 4400
who contacts the center
for help
will be given
an email address.
If we're satisfied
they're legitimate,
they'll be told
where to go.
Our goal is to get
every 4400 who wants shelter
to safety.
And then what?
Matthew will try
to continue
to end this peacefully,
but if we have to
protect our own...
we'll be ready.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Lily...
you make a good speech,
but this isn't korea,
and those
aren't soldiers,
and your daughter
could get caught
in the crossfire.
You don't think
i'm worried about her?
And you too?
Lily, i'm not looking
for a fight,
but right now,
we don't have another option.
Hey. Sam said he liked comics...
you son of a bitch!
You lied to me.
What?
Wait a minute.
It wasn't like that.
Oh, really,
"kyle bingham"?
Your last name
is baldwin,
and your dad works
for ntac.
So, what are you?
His little spy? Huh?
Did you think you were going to
sleep with me?
I was going to tell you
all about roy?
You go and you tell your daddy
that he didn't kill anybody.
I know that.
I was just trying to help you.
Why?
You come off like you're
this really great guy,
and all you were trying to do
was use me.
You're a lying prick.
Okay.
Okay.
This thing that's
killing them,
it's not a disease.
It's a side-effect.
Dr. Burkhoff,
just calm down.
What are you
talking about?
A side-effect of what?
I don't know exactly,
but i do know this...
there's a synthetic substance
present in the blood
of every 4400,
all the ones i tested,
every medical report
you gave me,
sick ones, well ones,
doesn't matter.
They all have it.
They even gave it a name.
They call it
"promicin inhibitor."
Promicin?
What's promicin?
I have no idea,
and i don't know why anyone
would want to inhibit it,
either.
But whatever it is,
it's gathering
in their lymph nodes,
compromising
their immune systems...
it's what's making them sick.
But ntac's been
studying the 4400
ever since
they got back.
They should have
known about this.
They do know.
It's all in here. They know.
So why haven't they
told anyone?
That's a very good question.
When you find out,
why don't you tell me?
[Car idling]
Are you sure
you want to do this?
Just get me and isabelle
someplace safe.
"P.i. Dosage"...
it's on memos,
in every 4400 medical report.
It's on the fifth page
of every report.
That's what hudson
had crossed out
when i went to see maia.
"P.i."
"Promicin inhibitor."
Alana was getting it too,
and shawn.
Everyone was getting it.
Every time
they came to ntac medical.
Every checkup.
We did it to them, tom.
We made them sick.
Previously on the 4400...
Kevin's a genius, you know,
but he doesn't brag about it.
Kevin, did you just speak to me ?
I haven't
said anything for a long time.
Try six years.
You're saying that Burkhoff
is the father of the 4400 technology.
I can think again too.
Kyle never came home last night.
Kyle said he blacked out.
You could've come to me, told me what was
going on. He's your cousin, your friend.
Kyle thinks he did something during one of
his blackouts. He seemed really freaked out about it.

If it happened during one of his blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.
I don't remember them telling me
to turn my son into a murderer.
I kept hoping
i was wrong about it.
This is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold onto that.
Kyle...
you weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.
You did not kill Jordan Collier.
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.
They just arrested
a suspect in the Collier killing.
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for. It's all over.
Not yet.
Thursday, July 28
5:37 pm
Mommy,
i'm scared.
I know, baby.
I'm scared too.
But it's going to be okay,
because mommy's here.
Okay ?
Whatever's coming through that door...
i'll protect you.
Thursday, July 28
7:22 am
Ten Hours Earlier
Today is Jordan Collier's Birthday
He died on NTAC's watch
What does that mean ?
What's what means ?
Nothing.
Just some crank..
it's nothing.
Guess it's Jordan Collier's birthday.
The state of washington gave him
a birthday present. Did you read this ?
They're talking like
it's an open-and-shut case.
He made threats against Collier.
Two witnesses picked him out of a lineup.
But they're wrong.
Roy marsden didn't kill Jordan Collier.
And neither did you, Kyle.
You told me he'd never see a courtroom.
They want to execute this guy.
It's not going to happen, Kyle.
No one can put him up on that roof. Any...
any public defender will have a motion to dismiss
in front of a judge by this time next week.
What if you're wrong ? What if they find him guilty ?
What am i supposed to do ? Nothing ?
Marsden has been in and out of jail since
he was 15. Theft, assault, attempted rape...
but he didn't kill anybody.
And he's not going to be convicted of it, Kyle.
I'm not going to let it happen.
Neither will i.
Kyle, it's not going to be easy, but you're going
to have to start putting all this behind you.
It's your first day back at school,
and i want you focused
and fierce,
and thinking about "a"s.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Sweetie...
Mrs. Benke's going to be here
any minute. It's time to get up.
I don't feel good.
You've got a real fever, young lady.
Hey,
how long have you had that ?
Dishonest ? No, no, no.
I don't think we're being dishonest at all.
Human beings use less than
20% of their brain capacity.
Everything else is just...
collecting cobwebs.
Here at the 4400 center,
we're trying to tap into
that unused potential.
So your own ability, you believe it
stems from increased brainpower ?
Show me another explanation.
Look, whether you believe that
we were taken to the future or not,
somebody did change us,
and they used technology to do it.
We're just trying to figure out
how and share it.
But "first keys," "second keys,"
"unlocking the ability inside you..."
you have to admit that the terminology
is more religious than scientific.
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.
It's a potent combination.
So what time was
your appointment for ?
They told me 11:15...
but they always tell me 11:15.
I never get in before 12:00, 12:30.
Hey, free health care, right ?
So what if they're so slow ?
Compulsory free health care.
You don't show up for a quarterly checkup,
you've got the goon squad knocking at your door.
You don't like it ?
Don't show.
Doubt they'd slap the cuffs
on someone's grandma.
Does it itch at all ?
Here.
103.1.
No wonder you wanted
to stay in bed.
Is it some kind of flu ?
Most likely.
Is it okay if we keep her
here for a few hours ?
I want to go home.
I know you do, honey, but dr. Hudson
is going to take very good care of you,
and i'll look in on you as often as i can.
I wish i brought Lemon.
That's her stuffed dog.
Let me guess.
He's yellow.
Yeah. Well, i could go
back and get him.
You have a very nice mommy.
I try.
About this rash...
now, i worked at the C. D. C. for seven years,
and i never saw anything like it.
It's kind of a weird shape, huh ?
Yeah.
Don't read too much into it.
It could still be
hives... an allergic reaction.
We'll take care of it.
Sweetie, you'll be okay here
if i go get lemon ?
Okay, my darling.
Bye, darling.
When daddy's away, he misses Isabelle so much.
But traveling around the country,
talking to all sorts of people,
clueing them in about my life...
it's kind of fun.
Shawn's amazing.
This woman comes in.
Her c. a. t. Scan says she's got
a brain tumor the size of a walnut.
20 minutes later, she's on
her way. Good as new.
Hmm.
I'll feed her.
She's not hungry yet.
How do you know ?
She told me before you came in.
So she's...
... talking to me.
Communicating.
Same as she does with you.
- Since when ?
- This morning.
I thought you'd be happy.
First time she ever said anything to me.
That's great.
It's just...
she hasn't said anything
to me for weeks.
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's just how you used to tell me...
kids always alternate
between parents. It's normal...
just with Isabelle,
it comes with a twist.
This is major Charles Culp of the National
Security Agency's field enforcement division.
D. C. Has loaned us his services.
Effective immediately, the major
and his team will be providing backup
in any 4400 cases
requiring armed intervention.
We know this office bears
a heavy caseload,
and we're here to help when needed.
Welcome aboard.
Hope you guys are up to it, 'cause
i'm going to have you on speed dial.
We'll stay out of your way,
let you do your jobs.
When the time comes,
we hope you'll return the favor.
Well, the last lady that we went up against
released poison spores from her palms, so, uh...
if you want to track her
down instead of me...
by all means.
My men and i are used to
unique challenges.
How long have we been asking
for tactical support ?
Eight months.
I guess someone up
there likes us.
You guys check your emails
this morning ?
"Happy birthday, Jordan Collier" ?
Everyone in the building
got that one.
Maybe Marco should have one
of his guys try to backtrack it.
They already did. It came from
a public terminal in an internet cafe.
It was a new email account.
Nice to know
Collier's still got his fans.
What's that ?
It's valerian root or
something. I don't know. Alana swears by it.
They calm me down a little.
My suggestion ?
Double your dosage.
The Baldwin trigger has been
a little "hair" lately.
My girlfriend agrees with you.
I need you to cover me
for an hour.
Maia's got the flu or something, and
Hudson wants her to spend the day here.
She okay ?
I'm sure it's nothing.
I mean, i was sure that it was the bubonic plague,
but her doctor tells me that it's nothing.
So you plowed into some guy
and got away with it ?
That's kind of a weird way to put it.
Well, the perks of having
a dad at N. T. A. C., i guess.
And this guy you hit,
how messed up was he ?
I can't really talk about it.
You know, it's lawyer stuff.
Who am i going to tell ?
I broke both his legs
and his collarbone.
That's it ?
He was in a car, Danny.
It's not like i mowed over a pedestrian.
Yeah, but you kept talking about this "awful thing"
you did. I thought you killed somebody.
What ?
Well, thanks a lot, man.
So did Shawn.
Well, sorry to disappoint you guys.
Well, look, do me a favor, okay ?
If you get in trouble again,
tell somebody.
There's nothing you can tell me
or Shawn that we can't handle.
Next time i black out and have a car accident,
you'll be the first to know.
Yeah, long as i'm not riding shotgun.
Oh, hey, listen, you want to go see
arcade fire with me on friday night, or
do you have to stay home
and nurse your guilty conscience ?
No nursing. I'll go.
- Yeah ?
- I'll go.
- All right.
- Yeah.
It's good to have you back.
Good to be back.
I got to go.
Okay. See you.
You hear that ?
That buzz ?
What is it ?
What ?
Is that coming from your gadget ?
Is what coming from my gadget ?
That noise.
I don't hear anything.
Neither do i.
What is that noise ?
You hear that ?
What's going on ?
I've got, like, a headache.
Did you hear that ?
A gift from me to you
Have fun trying to survive the day
Why is my signature
on this requisition ?
Because i had to get it in !
Do not sign my name
on another report.
They sit on your desk for weeks.
If there's a space for my signature,
it should be my signature !
Foster and mcclenahan are tearing
each other apart by the elevator.
Right before this started,
there was a noise.
I didn't hear anything.
Yeah, well, the rest of us did !
there was some kind
of high-pitched whine,
and we got another one of those emails.
It said, "have fun trying to survive the day."
Show me.
Okay, everybody try to stay calm.
If this noise or signal did something
to you... you've got to fight it.
What she's talking about ?
What did i just tell you ?
- Nina.
- you saw it.
She pulled her weapon first.
I was defending myself...
how is she ?
Breathing.
She's bleeding pretty bad.
Get her to medical.
Park is under arrest.
Crowley, restrain him.
Baldwin, what are you doing ?
Until we know what's going on,
nobody gets in and nobody goes out.
What's going on ?
Security procedure enabled.
Who's a very good girl ?
Isabelle is.
Isabelle's a smartie.
Glad to see you guys are having fun.
Lily. I didn't expect to
see you till 5:00.
Well, i'm taking an early lunch. I thought
i'd take Isabelle out to the garden.
That sounds fun.
Doesn't it, little girl ?
Oh, i use flash cards with her
all the time.
Let's see if i can find an apple.
It's her favorite.
What is this ?
Someone's been mixing up our cards.
I've told them a million times.
What do you use these for ?
These don't belong in the nursery.
I think they use them for the applicants.
Part of their psych profile. Sorry.
Okay, Isabelle.
Going to go with mommy.
Okay.
See you real soon.
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.
It's a potent combination.
The movement's 100,000 members
would certainly agree,
but Kevin Burkhoff, a neuroscientist
at western washington university,
thinks otherwise.
Uh, i don't question anybody's faith.
Why should i ? Faith is a good thing, right ?
But what they're doing over there at the center
has nothing to do with science. I mean,
you tell me how fasting,
meditation, and chanting
can alter, in any way, your
neurochemistry. It's preposterous.
It's a good scam,
but still preposterous.
"Scam." That's a strong word.
it fits. They're taking
this kernel of truth
about the brain's potential, and using it
to bilk people out of their life savings.
A lot of people might be surprised
by your stance. After all,
you suffered from paranoid
personality disorder for years.
Wasn't it a device engineered
by a 4400 that cured you ?
Yes, and i'm grateful,
but you need to make the distinction
between the 4400 and the 4400 center.
4400s have remarkable abilities...
everybody knows it...
but the center is co-opting
that phenomenon for profit.
Those machines they're hooking
people up to over there ?
They might as well not
even be plugged in.
If you ask me, he still
looks rather demented.
He seemed pretty sane to me, Matthew,
especially when he was ripping us...
Shawn, don't overreact.
It's just one interview.
Oh...
You did good, though.
Yeah.
Garrity, give me the gun.
Look, this is crazy, Baldwin.
How are we going to
defend ourselves ?
Whoever's doing this wants us
to attack each other.
If we stay armed, we're dead
by the end of the day.
If we don't, we'll be slaughtered.
Look, everyone in the building
is under the effects of this thing, okay ?
The cafeteria staff could be
forming an army right now.
Which is why i'll find out
who's doing this and stop it.
They're doing checkups in the medical lab today.
That means there's 4400s in the building.
You think that one of them
is behind this ?
I...
I don't know,
but right now,
it's all i have to go on.
You ?
Who put you in command ?
He's not. I am.
This building is the target
of a 4400 terrorist attack.
It is now a military situation.
This is great, Baldwin.
Why don't you explain to these guys
why they should just lay down their arms, huh ?
Major Culp, the signal, whatever it is,
it's like someone set off a rage bomb.
It's pumping up the aggression of everybody
in the building. The men, anyway.
We cannot be walking around
with loaded firearms.
My team's trained to resist
psychological pressure tactics.
This is a 4400 ability.
You can't resist it.
There's 4400s down in the med lab.
It's probably one of them doing it.
Baldwin was just headed
down there right now.
Cartwright, watch them.
Everyone else, with me.
Just wait. Wait.
What are you going to do ?
I'm going to find out which one of
them's responsible for this.
And then what ?
I'm going to make sure that it stops.
Be careful.
There's a little girl down there.
If it's not her,
then she has nothing
to worry about.
You have to let me out !
We got to get out !
We're going to get killed !
Would you stop saying
that already ?
It's not helping.
An "a" ?
That's great.
But what's my name
doing on here ?
Well, we're lab partners, right ?
This is our presentation.
But i haven't met with you in almost three
weeks. I didn't type a word of this.
Well, it's not like you didn't do anything.
You said you wanted to do a paper on mitosis.
You stained the slides.
One or two of them, maybe.
Look... you were in trouble, right ?
I just figured
that whatever it was,
you could probably do without
an "incomplete" in bio.
I still don't know if i deserve this,
but thank you.
What can i say ?
I have a soft spot for stray cats.
I look that pathetic ?
Hardly.
You're shooting up ?
Doesn't exactly fill me
with confidence.
It's a sedative.
If i lose control
and become like everyone
else in this place,
i can't help you anymore.
What's happening to my agents ?
I don't feel any different,
but they're all going crazy.
Dr. Hudson ?
I feel worse.
You shouldn't be out of bed.
Sweetie, what's that on your arm ?
Skouris, N. T. A. C. I need to get past.
Building's locked down.
Well, what's going on ?
Security breach from the inside.
That's all we know.
- I have to get through.
- That's not going to happen.
You don't understand.
My daughter's in there.
Thursday, July 28
3:19 pm
Well, I can't do it myself.
Turn around.
Hold still.
I can't believe you
broke my nose.
Yeah, well, you broke
my knuckle when i hit you.
But i'm still right.
The signal is constant.
It doesn't matter if you can hear it
or not. It's like a dog whistle.
It's one pulse, and it'll wear off.
We just have to wait it out...
Both of you guys shut up !
I'm trying to get work done.
Not a good time, Diana.
Marco, what's going on in there ?
Depends on who you ask.
Somebody's definitely
set off a whammy in here.
Something's pumping up
our "fight or flight" instincts.
Heavy emphasis
on the "fight" part.
Well, Marco, i need to get inside,
and i need your help.
Every male in this building has got a gallon of
adrenaline coursing through his veins right now.
And most of them are armed.
If you're on the outside, stay there.
Listen to me, Marco. Maia is inside,
and i need to get to her.
Do you have access
to the building schematics ?
Uh, yeah.
I can pull them up.
Do it.
And what do i get in return ?
Well, we can talk about that later.
Good. Good.
I'm going to hold you to that.
Get off me.
You're in my space !
Hang on.
- You're in my space !
- Guys !
Settle it later !
We've got to get
Skouris into the building.
I said get on your knees.
I just need to take these.
They're keeping me calm.
Little late for that.
You sure you don't want one ?
They might help.
Cut us loose. Come on.
Cut me free.
Get some cuffs.
Put them on commando-boy.
Then you can let everybody else go.
Hey, hey, where are you going ?
I'm going to the med labs. Hopefully
the major met some resistance along the way.
What kind of tests ?
You mean like an i. q. Thing ?
I don't know, Richard.
Those flash cards were weird,
and after we got back,
i was changing her.
She has these marks on her skin.
Marks ? Bruises ?
No. Like irritations.
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.
Let me see.
They faded.
Richard...
don't look at me like that.
I'm not imagining things.
She's not going back
to that nursery.
Lily... all you've been talking about
is how much you love ruth
and the nursery, and how much
Isabelle seems to love it there.
I wish you'd been there.
I mean, ruth, she had
this weird smile on her face.
Think about what you're saying.
Nobody's doing tests on her at the nursery.
You know, i know you feel
like she's shutting you out, and
no offense, but maybe
this is an overreaction.
- Can i take her for a second ?
- No.
Lily, what are you doing ?
I'm sorry.
It's just this place.
I feel like it's changing everything,
like it's changing us.
we're okay.
Everything's okay.
The meditation courses, the synaptic potential
readers, and our purification seminars...
that's half our curriculum
you're putting on the chopping block.
We don't need them, Matthew.
Jordan seemed to think we did.
Jordan's not here anymore, is he ?
Besides, that Burkhoff guy is right...
a bunch of chanting is not going to
unlock the 4400 inside of anyone.
Whether it will or it won't,
the product is selling.
Wait, wait, wait. "product" ?
This is not a pyramid scheme, Matthew.
People are coming here, they're looking to be
changed. They're looking for answers.
And we'll find them,
but if we change, we look weak.
For now, all that matters is that
people believe in what we're doing.
I need to believe in it, too.
Nobody move !
They're gone.
They all took off.
Who are you ?
Roger wolcott.
I'm just here for my checkup.
The 4400 ?
Why else would i be here ?
Now cut me loose !
Thursday, July 28
4:22 pm
That's not going to hold anybody.
Not for long. Let's hope no one finds us.
What do you think
our chances are ?
The calmer we are,
the longer we stay alive.
How are you doing, sweetie ?
I feel all sweaty,
and it's getting hard to breathe.
Poor baby.
I have something for you.
- Lemon.
- Yeah.
As soon as this is over, i'm going
to get you to the hospital, okay ?
All right.
I'm guessing you don't have
a stuffed animal for me.
Maybe a fifth of Jack Daniels ?
Sorry.
Looks like it's starting to clot.
You need another shot for pain ?
No.
You need the sedatives
more than i do.
How many shots have you taken ?
Three.
And you're still on your feet ? Shouldn't that
have knocked you on your ass by now ?
Well, on a normal day, i'd be out
for the next 12 hours, but today,
it's barely enough
to keep me sane.
Well, thank you...
for keeping Maia safe.
She's a sweet kid.
Listen, Diana...
look, i've only got
three shots left.
They're wearing off a little
faster each time, so...
i don't want to hurt anybody.
I don't want to kill anybody. So if i...
start to go...
oh, don't worry.
I'll take care of you.
Do me a favor...
back of the head, okay ?
You'll never see it coming.
Now, listen, Hudson...
look, i just gave you permission
to blow my head off.
Why don't you call me Max ?
All right, Max.
About this signal...
which one of these bitches
do you think is sending it ?
I don't see what this
has to do with anything.
Hey, you wanted to
know my story.
Well, right now, you're living it.
Open your eyes.
Now, imagine three years went
by while you had them shut.
Can't do it.
Neither could i...
but they were gone.
I missed senior year of high school,
which is supposedly the best year ever.
I got robbed. The rest
of high school just sucked.
So this blackout that
you had behind the wheel,
that was some sort of
after-effect of the coma ?
Yeah.
Wow.
God, you've been through so much.
You're jealous ?
What part sounds good ?
The coma ?
The hit and run ?
I'm jealous
because you have all
this experience under your belt.
It makes you interesting.
But i didn't do it.
It wasn't me.
Great, so now someone
can kill me in my sleep.
How do you know it's one of us ?
Well, i don't,
but none of you are talking,
and so i'm about out of options.
This isn't going to make
a damn bit of difference.
That's it.
No more sedatives.
Can you still function as a doctor ?
For now.
Kind of busy here, Diana.
We just put the 4400s under, but we're
not sure if that's killed the signal.
Do you still feel amped up ?
Yes, i do, okay ?
I'm working on it from my end.
What's that noise ?
I'm trying to counter
the effects of the signal.
If you'd just shut up for a second,
maybe i could find the right frequency...
Okay, calm down, Marco.
I need you to do this.
It always has to be me,
doesn't it ?
Old, reliable Marco
does whatever you want.
I truly believe in what
we're trying to do.
The 4400 are the template
for the next stage in human evolution.
Do you mind backing up ?
You're standing a little close.
We can recreate the technology
they used to change us.
Not by chanting "om"
three times, you can't.
Agreed...
but if you come to work with us,
we could get somewhere.
You know,
the government
has approached me
half a dozen times.
They seem to have
this bizarre theory i'm
the father of this new branch
of science. I turned them down.
I don't like working
with people with badges.
Listen, you can't blame
them for being curious.
You were in a mental hospital
for... six years ?
The future busted its ass
to get you working again.
I haven't forgotten my debts.

Oh ? What's that ?
Signing bonus ?
Fancy car ?
Me.
I'm the poster boy, right ?
Healing hands.
Unlimited access.
Can you really turn that down ?
Mommy,
i'm scared.
I know, baby.
I'm scared too.
But it's going to be okay,
because mommy's here.
Okay ?
Whatever's coming
through that door...
i'll protect you.
Tom.
Tom... put the gun down.
It's me. It's Diana.
No, you'll... you'll shoot me
if i put it down.
No, Tom.
I don't want to hurt you.
Well, i want to hurt you, Diana.
Tom... i said calm down.
My mom always wanted me
to hit it off with a cute doctor,
but make another move,
and i will pull this trigger.
What is that ?
That'd be Marco
earning his paycheck.
I feel like an idiot.
It's just... Isabelle and i
were so close for so long.
And you still are.
I know.
It's like you say...
she's a baby.
It isn't personal.
Yeah, you just have
to remember that.
Hey, ruth, look who's back.
That was a long lunch.
Yeah, sorry.
Time got away from us.
Come on. Here you are.
we'll be back in an hour for her.
- We'll be here.
- Thank you.
Bye, Isabelle.
I'd still like to do
a little house-hunting.
We could take a look around,
see what's out there.
You're in charge until i'm released.
Pool whatever manpower is still up walking.
Start picking up the pieces.
- I'll handle it.
- Mm-hmm.
All right. And you get
that head looked at.
How are you doing ?
Well, for a slender lady,
you pack a punch.
I can't take all the credit.
Culp softened you up a little bit.
Hmm.
It's the final tally.
Three agents dead, two N. S. A.
operatives, a 4400...
concussions, broken bones,
stab wounds... yikes.
It's tough to swallow. It was
a major attack, and we weren't ready.
Yeah.
How are you, baby ?
Okay.
Not so good.
I've got her on glucose
and erythromycin.
We're going to get her over to St. Michael's
and see if we can bring that fever down.
And the rash ?
I'm going to bring in a specialist.
Should i be worried ?
Brett Kellerman is one of the best dermatologists
in the city. I'm sure he'll figure it out.
You're coming with us,
right ?
Of course. I'll be right there
in the ambulance with you.
All right, i'll get to the hospital
as soon as i can.
Okay.
- Oh, Max...
- yeah.
Thank you... for everything.
No, thank you, for...
well, for not putting one
in the back of my head.
Uh, so those 4400s
Diana was protecting...
they're not going to see daylight until N. T. A. C.'s
sure they're not responsible for this.
That's going to be
a marathon debriefing session.
Yeah, i bet you they'll
both be up all night.
Both ?
I thought Diana said
there was three of them.
Tom ?
She's gone.
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified government facility,
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.
Do they even have
a name for that ?
Yeah, "terrorism."
Payback is a bitch.
Welcome to the center.
Would you like to sign up for the tour ?
No.
Tell Shawn Farrell that Kevin
Burkhoff is here to see him.
I'm sorry. Mr. Farrell's
busy at the moment.
Is there a message
i can pass along ?
Yes.
I want to get
started immediately.
You can stay over if you like.
Get some dinner,
do a little studying...
Kyle ?
Are you okay ?
I don't deserve you.
That is so sweet.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Shawn...
this is Olivia Cohen.
Take a seat here.
Mm-hmm.
That's good.
She lost her eyesight to macular
degeneration 10 years ago.
The foundation was
very moved by her story.
Hi, Mrs. Cohen.
Hello.
It's nice to meet you.
So, uh,
what we're going to do here
is going to feel
a little weird, but
when we're done,
you'll be able to see again.
Oh, i can't wait.
I have to admit,
i'm a little nervous.
You don't have to be.
I'm going to take
your hands now, okay ?
Mm-hmm.
Here we go.
Here we go.
So when does it start ?
When do i see again ?
Just give me a moment.
Shawn ?
Oh...
What's wrong ?
I don't know.
Is it warm in here ?

Previously on the 4400...
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.
Roy Marsden didn't kill
Jordan Collier.
And neither did you, Kyle.
Son of a bitch !
You go and you tell your daddy
that he didn't kill anybody.
If Maia's having visions, you should know about it,
and you should know what they are.
mommy's bosses will be
punished for betraying us.
I want to go home.
I know you do, honey, but Dr. Hudson
is going to take very good care of you.
Don't tell anyone i can't heal.
Sure.
What are you going to do ?
What i have to.
If you're sick, the responsible
thing is to report to ntac,
but if you are well...
walking into quarantine is an easy step,
but walking out, that might be
considerably more difficult.
There's a synthetic substance
present in the blood of every 4400.
They even gave it a name.
They call it...
"promicin inhibitor."
Every time they came to ntac
medical, every checkup.
Your daughter is the rosetta stone
for understanding what happened to the 4400.
We're her parents. We decide.
Are you sure you want to do this ?
Just get me and Isabelle
someplace safe.
But if it comes down to a choice
between the safety of the american people
and the welfare of the 4400, Tom...
that's no choice at all.
We tried being reasonable.
In 10 hours, we start rounding them up.
Easy, McCullough.
Let me go ! I'm not sick !
There's nothing wrong with me !
We know that, but you're a 4400,
and everybody's got to go in.
Come on...
now, i don't want to cuff you,
but if you run again,
you're going to give me no choice.
"Quarantine" is just a word to you guys.
Try living it.
Come on.
What are we doing here, Diana ?
This is so wrong.
All right, what do you suggest ?
We walk into the middle of ntac,
and shout out, "we did this.
We made them sick."
Yeah, yeah, that's good start. We've got the
medical records. We can take them to Dennis.
You really think that Max Hudson
and a couple of rogue doctors
hatched a covert plan
to poison the 4400 ? I mean,
you really think that they could
do that without approval ?
Whose approval ?
Dennis Ryland's, for one. He was the head of
this division when this whole thing started.
I mean, you think he didn't know ?
Until we know how far up this goes,
we've got to stay calm,
work quietly...
and watch our backs.
Don't tell me to calm down, Lily.
How am i supposed to be calm when my wife
and daughter left in the middle of the night ?
We didn't leave you, Richard.
I just didn't feel like
Isabelle was safe there.
You've turned this resisting quarantine
into your personal mission.
Ntac turned it into my personal mission
when they started rounding us up.
And i admire what you're doing,
but it's not my fight,
and i sure as hell won't let it
become Isabelle's fight.
Just tell me where you are.
Put my mind at ease. I'll come see you.
Lily ?
I'm sorry. I just feel like
it's better this way for now.
I'll call soon.
That didn't go as well
as mommy hoped.
- 911. please state the nature of...
- No...
i need an ambulance.
I'm... i'm sick.
I've got this...
Hello ?
Hello ?
Miss, are you there ?
Never mind.
Think they're sharing trade secrets ?
Either that, or she's asking
for her office back.
- After you.
- Thanks.
Nina.
Good to see you.
Thanks. I wish the circumstances
were a little better.
We lost the first 4400s
to this thing overnight.
Seven dead.
There'll be more by day's end.
No word about a vaccine, a cure ?
I just got off the phone with Hudson. He said
that they've worked on a few things overnight.
I'm going to quarantine.
Diana...
i know this is frustrating,
but we've got the best minds in the country,
in the world, working on this.
Well, they better work fast.
Seven people are dead.
Alana could be next,
or Maia,
and still, nobody has any idea
where this came from, do they ?
We'll get it figured out.
Hey, sweetie.
It's me, Tom.
Who are you ?
Who are you ?
She was awake earlier.
Only for a few minutes, though.
Did she say anything ?
She talked about you.
Said you were going to
make everything okay.
I hope she's right.
Me too.
Let's go.
Where are we headed ?
We've got an appointment
with the good doctor Hudson.
Diana, what...
what the hell are you doing ?
We've got some things
we need to talk about, Max.
We may have what
they have too soon.
This guy your agents
brought in, rOrson Bailey,
i think i can explain
how he developed this...
jesus, i can't even say the word.
Telekinesis.
Thank you.
The body produces four main neurotransmitters.
They're like traffic cops to the brain.
They control everything,
regulate everything.
Tell me something i don't know.
Bailey is producing
a fifth neurotransmitter.
We've never seen it before.
Nobody has.
I'm guessing it factors into Bailey's ability
to bend spoons with his mind.
Let's just say promicin is basically a backstage
pass to the v. i. p. Section of the brain.
He is using parts of the cerebellum
no human has ever had access to.
I ran some tests on the 4400s
who are still in quarantine.
Every single one of them
is producing trace amounts of promicin.
So it's just a matter of time
before every 4400 develops telekinesis ?
Promicin's behavior is unpredictable.
They might not get telekinesis,
but they'll get something.
Put everything on paper.
I want to get my talking points straight
before i try to explain this to D. C.
D. C. Panicked.
I was ordered to work on a drug to suppress
the production of promicin in the 4400.
Once i synthesized the inhibitor,
we gave it to every 4400,
every time they came in for a checkup.
But it doesn't even work.
4400s are developing abilities all the time.
A small percentage of them are,
but if it wasn't for the inhibitor,
they'd all have them.
I know it didn't work perfectly.
"Perfectly ?"
Seven 4400s died last night.
It was your inhibitor that did it.
You made them sick !
You think i don't know that ?
We weren't trying to kill anyone.
We were preserving the status quo,
doing a good thing.
I guess it backfired.
I am trying to undo it,
but if you want to pull that trigger,
please, be my guest.
Maybe then finally
i'll get some sleep.
All right.
If you're not going to shoot me,
let me get back to work.
I don't want anyone else to die.
Alison ?
What are you doing here ?
They're going to give Roy life.
They're going to give him life,
and he's going to take it.
What are you talking about ?
The state was going to go for
the death penalty, and the
public defender convinced Roy
to take a plea bargain.
But they've got no case against him.
My dad told me.
I don't know. This lawyer,
he's handling, like, 10 different cases,
and he just doesn't want to see
the inside of a courtroom. I don't know.
But he didn't do it, okay ?
He didn't kill Jordan Collier.
You keep saying that. Does your
dad know something ? What ?
Is there evidence
that they're hiding ?
What ? You have to tell me.
If Roy takes this deal,
he can't even get parole for 20 years.
He's not going to prison.
Why ?
The 4400 came back august 14th.
Hudson discovered
promicin october 11th.
So they probably gave the first doses of the inhibitor
sometime around the end of the month.
But we have every internal document for october.
There's nothing about any of this.
There's hardly even
a mention of Orson Bailey.
We both wrote reports about him,
Diana. They're gone.
They were hoping that was going to be the only
extrahuman ability ever developed in a 4400.
If they destRoy all records of it...
nobody would ever know.
But this went to the top of the food chain.
Here. Britain, France, Korea...
everywhere there's a sick 4400.
There has to be a paper trail.
Does it even matter ?
we could find a memo signed by the entire
united nations security council.
It's not going to cure anyone.
Diana, we delivered confidential
medical records to Dr. Burkhoff.
We've got the so-called
"father of 4400 technology"
working on the case,
and you just stuck a gun
to the head of ntac's medical director.
We've done everything we can
to get the right people working on a cure.
That's if ntac even wants a cure.
Ryland's been talking about people in D. C.
who've been on a wartime footing for months.
This is nothing but
a stroke of luck for them.
You think they want them all dead ?
I told you !
I told you i wasn't safe here.
It's just a precaution, Kevin.
We think you'll just be safer
if you move to a less exposed location.
It's because i told you
about that inhibitor thing, right ?
I spent six years in a psychiatric hospital
suffering from paranoid personality disorder.
As soon as i get out, you two put me smack
in the middle of a massive conspiracy.
Dr. Burkhoff's been spinning all kinds of stories
about ntac. Very interesting stuff.
Well, he can spin all the theories
he wants, just not here.
I'll make sure he has
a safe place to work.
I figured out what promicin is.
That's the name they gave the neurotransmitter, right ?
The one that gives the 4400 their abilities ?
And if i can find one 4400 that
hasn't been exposed to the inhibitor,
i think i can neutralize it.
Hey.
You scared me.
Why didn't you use your key ?
Oh, sorry. My hands were full.
I brought you guys some supplies.
You still like chocolate cherry ?
That sounds great. Thank you.
Oh...
you...
you okay ?
Yeah, just jumpy.
It's so quiet out here.
Yeah, a lot of places have
closed up for the season.
Oh, i thought that, uh...
maybe i could stay for
a little dinner or something.
You don't have to get back home ?
No, not really.
Carol's gone.
She found out
that you and i were talking.
Don't worry, she doesn't know
you're here, but she got mad.
Brian, i'm sorry.
She'll stay away for a few nights.
I'll stay on the couch for a while...
but in the meantime,
Heidi's staying with a friend,
and i figured, why eat alone ?
Sure,
but i hope you're not expecting much.
I haven't made pot roast in a while.
You know, Lily, the truth is...
i never should have married
Carol in the first place.
What are you doing, Brian ?
Come on. I'm alone.
You're alone.
You and Richard aren't happy.
That's not true.
We could have it back, Lily.
- Don't, Brian.
- Why are you fighting it ?
Brian, stop it ! Let me go !
- I don't want to hurt you, Lily !
- Stop it !
You little bitch.
Hello ?
Lily ?
Are you okay ?
Brian ?
Yeah, i was going to
bring by some food.
Don't.
Something's not right here.
I haven't heard from the safe
house in wheeling for a day.
We have to assume it's been compromised.
That's the third one that's gone silent.
They're picking us off one by one.
We might want to think about fighting back.
We can do that, Richard.
We certainly have 4400s
that can do some damage,
but once we take that step,
there's no turning back.
Excuse me, but shouldn't there
be bars on these windows ?
The point is to be
unobtrusive, Dr. Burkhoff.
Well,
this seems a little lax to me.
Most of you are 4400s.
I'm a collaborator.
You know what they do
to collaborators ?
We need to get him working.
It calms him down considerably.
We cleared out a room for you.
Anything you need, just let us know.
What i need is a clean 4400, one that
hasn't been exposed to the inhibitor.
I don't guess you've got
one of those, do you ?
Actually, i might.
20 years, i've never seen you
pour a drink on government property.
I never supervised a round-up
of innocent citizens before.
Conscience bothering you, Dennis ?
Hell, yes...
it is...
and given the circumstances,
i'd say that's a good sign,
but i'm trying to focus
on my job, Tom...
and i need the same from you.
But sometimes when you...
you look for one thing, you...
you learn something else.
You know how it is, Dennis.
I know exactly what you mean.
I've learned some things myself.
Open it.
Knowledge is a burden, huh, Tom ?
Did you think that i would release Kyle from
quarantine and not keep an eye on him ?
Why didn't you stop this ?
Because i didn't know
exactly what Kyle was going to do.
I just sort of let the future play out.
Isn't that what you're always talking about ?
You set up Roy Marsden.
That was my gift to you, Tom.
Would you rather
i just turn these over to my bosses ?
I would rather you be the friend...
you be the Ryland i worked
with for 20 years.
I haven't changed.
I have a tough job,
and i'm doing my best,
and as your boss,
and as your friend,
i expect support.
Kyle hated quarantine.
I wonder what he thinks of prison.
They know.
Ntac knows you shot Collier.
What ? How ?
They've known all along.
They let it happen.
I need you to be ready
to get out of here.
I'm going to call Alana's friends.
You're sending me to Spain ?
If they come after you, i need you
to be ready to leave right away.
Did you hear Roy Marsden's
being sent to jail for life ?
They set him up.
But if i run...
just one thing at a time, Kyle.
Let me worry about you,
then i will deal with Marsden.
So you want me to start packing ?
Yeah, Kyle !
Aren't you hearing me ?
<i>I confess to the murder of Jordan Collier</i>
He committed suicide ?
I know that Max was
under a lot of strain, but...
he had all those people's
lives in his hands. Maia's...
i know,
but Dr. Pinero's been Hudson's number
two from the very beginning.
He knows everything that Hudson knew.
We're still going to beat this thing.
- Good morning, Tom.
- Nina.
Here.
I grabbed this out of your mail cubby.
Did you hear about Hudson ?
Yeah. You okay ?
They're calling it a suicide.
What are you calling it ?
Tom, look at this.
It's from Max.
"Firewall memo."
What is that ?
I don't know.
Why are you doing this, Isabelle ?
Mommy needs to know.
I brought you here so we could be safe.
Don't you want that ?
Lily, what's going on out here ?
You okay ?
No. Go away !
I told you not to come here !
That's why i'm here.
Lily, please, let me in.
How do i know you're real ?
What are you talking about ?
Of course i'm real.
Did carol leave you ?
Why would she leave me ?
Lily, i'm coming in, okay ?
No. No !
No !
Lily... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Lily...
put down the knife. Please.
I just came to check on you guys,
make sure you were okay.
Look, it's me.
Brian.
Put the knife down.
Lily, we're all going to die.
Is that what you want ?
No !
Stop it, Isabelle !
No !
Lily, i heard screaming.
What is going on ?
Brian... if you're real,
you've got to get me out.
Isabelle doesn't want to be here.
Firewall... it's a program, a safety net.
That's how you keep viruses off your hard drive.
Okay, did you ever see a memo with the
word "firewall" written in the subject line ?
No, but i don't read most of the memos
that circulate around here anyway.
Look, how long are you guys going to be working
in here ? What, are they painting your offices ?
We need a little privacy, okay ?
Tom, this memo, whatever it is, i doubt it
ever went out on a general distribution,
and every copy probably went
through the shredder months ago.
So if there's no hard copy, and if
Marco is the only one we even trust
to even talk about it with,
then we're at a dead end.
We could always march into Ryland's
office and ask him about it.
The guy does know memos.
When he was working here, i must have
thrown away, like, 15 every day.
More like 20. He liked to keep
his keyboard burning.
Who, Ryland ?
Yeah.
He didn't type. He used to call me in
sometimes when he froze up his computer.
Hunt-and-peck city.
Took him 10 minutes to type
in an email address.
Ryland dictated everything to his secretary.
She had "l" level security clearance.
Look.
"D. R. / J. O."
Everything says "d. R. / J. O."
"D. R.," Dennis Ryland.
And "J. O." is Jane Orman.
She worked for him for 22 years.
Did she stay in Seattle ?
Say hi for me.
Lily.
You came back.
Are you all right ?
I thought i was doing
the smart thing,
but Isabelle...
what happened ?
She just wanted to be with you,
and this place... i don't know.
Hey.
Did you miss daddy ?
Yeah ?
Well, he missed you.
Both of you.
Listen, i'm, uh...
i'm going to take off.
Brian...
thank you... for everything.
Hey, uh...
do me a favor...
forget this address,
forget about all of us,
and i'll forget you drove off with
my wife in the middle of the night.
Good luck, Lil.
Hey, i've been calling you all day.
There's a guy here who thinks that Isabelle...
excuse me. Didn't anyone
hear that car pull up...
is that her ?
I think there's somebody here
who wants to meet you.
This is Isabelle.
What are we supposed to say ?
You know that
massive conspiracy to suppress
the abilities of the 4400 ?
We were just kind of hoping
you would fill us in on the particulars.
Yeah, and don't be nervous, but we had to shake
a government tail on the way here to do it.
Yeah, sounds like a start.
Hmm...
Tom Baldwin.
Long time, Jane.
Do you remember my
partner, Diana Skouris ?
- Of course.
- Yeah. Hi.
I always wondered
who would show up.
I should have figured
it'd be the two of you.
You're here about firewall, right ?
Come on in.
The inhibitor hasn't been tested.
It is not ready.
One of the 4400 is a serial killer
who was using, i don't know,
some kind of mind control to get people
to commit murder. The inhibitor's ready.
This is wrong, Dennis.
We are beyond right and wrong here !
There's no precedent for this.
Now, D. C.'s been advised
of the operation.
It's been approved at the highest level.
There is nothing further to discuss, is there ?
I am not doing this.
I took it home with me that night.
The next day, i put in my notice.
I mean, you have to understand,
for two decades,
i thought that Dennis Ryland
was the finest man i ever met,
and after i read this, i couldn't
work for him anymore.
I kept telling myself i should send it
somewhere... the newspapers, or...
i don't know...
but the names that signed off on this...
i was just a secretary.
What could i do against those names ?
It's all here.
Did you see the names ?
When Maia said, "mommy's bosses
are going to be punished,"
i had no idea she meant
all the way up the chain of command.
We can't go public yet.
What ?
We can't go public yet.
Listen, the faster this gets exposed, the better
it is for Maia, Alana, Shawn... all of them.
No more secrets. No more relying on
the people who did this to find a cure.
At the very least, they're going to have
to rescind the quarantine order.
Diana, Ryland's got
something on me.
Ryland ?
This entire memo is over his signature.
What could he possibly have over you ?
He knows Kyle killed
Jordan Collier.
What ?
That night on highland beach, they put someone
inside of him, or some program... i don't know...
directing his actions,
and Ryland has evidence.
I'm sorry, Tom,
but i can't just sit on this !
Maia's getting sicker !
Just give me one hour, Diana.
Just one hour.
Please.
Stop saying that.
It's not okay, Kyle.
If i go through with this,
they're going to come after you,
and it doesn't matter
if you're in Spain or Siberia.
I know, but with all those lives
at stake, you have to do it.
Okay, i'm taking you to the airport.
Dad...
i'm not going anywhere.
This actually makes it easier.
I didn't know how i was going to tell you.
Tell me what ?
I can't live like this anymore.
I can't live knowing
that guy is in jail.
I go through every day trying to pretend
it's all normal, but it's just a cover-up.
I can't let you do it, Kyle.
Marsden shot at me.
He, uh... he shot at other cops too.
Even if you confess, Kyle,
he is still going to jail.
You try to bury stuff like
this, it changes you.
Look what it did to your boss.
Ryland used to be your friend.
It's over, dad. No more lies.
I can't do it anymore. I just can't do it.
Okay ? You can't stop me.
Okay ?
Don't you do anything
until i get back.
You hear me ?
This is the right thing,
the heroic thing,
and being a hero comes
with some perks.
You tell me what i need to know,
i'll see that you're transferred to
a private quarantine facility this afternoon.
You can walk the grounds,
you can choose your own meals...
what's wrong with that ?
139 Lebanon street.
That's where they told me to go.
The inhibitor
is piggybacking on glucose.
It enters the brain through facilitated
diffusion. It's a binding protein.
That's how they did it...
i'll take your word for it.
But this serum
has pure promicin in it.
It can neutralize the charge.
The inhibitor won't be able to cross membranes
anymore. We can flush it out of their systems.
So once it's gone,
the disease goes away ?
Please.
Stop saying "disease."
For the last time, it's a side effect.
Remove the inhibitor,
the immune system functions.
It'll happen virtually instantly.
So
this substance...
promicin.
It's what makes you people unique.
How did you get it out
of my daughter ?
She has
race amounts of it
in her bloodstream.
Before the inhibitor, you all did.
That's how they found it
in the first place...
but...
she's an infant.
I could only draw enough blood...
to make one shot.
If you can get
that into quarantine,
one shot might be all you need.
Nina, where's Ryland ?
A 4400 gave up
the seattle safe house.
They're on their way
to take it down.
Excuse me.
Please don't shoot.
Dr. Burkhoff, why
would we shoot you ?
I have no idea, but i'm feeling
a little insecure right now.
I brought something for you.
Whatever you do, don't
drop it.
Everybody in this house
is subject to quarantine and arrest
under emergency order 74.
You have five minutes
to come out peacefully.
If not, we'll come in and get you.
Oh...
There's an army out there.
Ryland !
Call it off.
It's over.
Quarantine. Everything.
Agent Baldwin is obstructing
justice. Arrest him.
I don't think so, Dennis.
I know about firewall.
Keep your weapon on him.
You're really willing
to give up your son ?
Kyle's turning himself in.
He can't live with the cover-up.
When i wrote that memo,
we had no idea where the 4400 were
from or why they were brought back.
Dr. Hudson gave me information.
I acted on it, Tom.
If you were in my chair,
you'd have done the same thing.
Hi.
I've got some medicine for you.
To be honest with you,
i'd rather be giving this to Maia,
but a crazy neuroscientist told me that
that was not the right thing to do, so
if you don't mind holding still
for a minute...
you saw Orson Bailey
up close and personal.
Oliver Knox.
You know what these people
were capable of.
Hell, i attached your reports
to the memo when i sent it to D. C.
But we learned better, Dennis.
Highland beach ?
"Save the future ?"
Heartfelt message, Tom,
and while they were giving it to you, they were
programming your son to commit murder.
Does that sound to you like
they were guiding us toward eden ?
I don't know, but i sure as hell
don't want to go where you're taking me.
Goddammit, Tom !
What does it even mean,
"save the future ?"
Save the future how ?
Kill us all ? Start over with a smaller,
more evolved population ?
Is that an outcome
you can live with ?
What can you live with, Dennis ?
Was Max Hudson really a suicide,
or did you pull that little string too ?
And what about me, Dennis ?
Because if you're holding on to any
hope of keeping this covered up,
you're going to have to start by putting me
in the ground right here and right now.
Tom, you're reducing the fate of the planet
to a question of your personal faith.
Without the inhibitor program,
who the hell knows what'll happen ?
Who the hell ever knows ?
Very wise.
Pithy.
But if the world turns out to be a place
of unchecked 4400 abilities,
i hope we don't live to regret it.
Stand down !
We're done here.
You can all go home now.
- Thomas.
- Alana.
Alana.
Thomas...
What happened here ?
A miracle.
Welcome home, baby.
Home...
i never even unpacked.
We'll take care of that right now.
Where's Kyle ?
I can't wait to see him.
Yeah, i told him you were coming home.
Hey, Kyle ! We're back !
Hey, Kyle.
Man, i never thought
i was going to see you again.
You're okay, right ?
I feel like i did 15 keg stands last night,
but yeah, pretty much.
We all are.
Dr. Burkhoff took blood samples
from the people that i healed.
Every sample he gets
cures someone else, so...
hey, you guys kind of lucked out, huh ?
"Lucked out ?" There's 23 of us dead,
and they don't even have a final count yet.
I don't think that was part
of the plan, you know ?
That's not why
they brought us back.
This whole idea that there's
some kind of plan... i don't know.
I wish i could believe that.
Just trust me when i say
that there's a plan,
it's important,
and every 4400 is a part of it.
Shawn...
i killed Jordan Collier.
What ?
I bought a rifle, i went up on that roof, took out
two government agents, and then i shot him.
Remember when i was in trouble ? Losing
chunks of time ? That's what i was doing.
Planning out an assassination.
Why ?
You think i know ? There's
something inside me, Shawn...
or someone.
It takes over.
Those people who took you ?
If they have a plan,
it includes me killing Jordan Collier.
That's not true, Kyle !
Then why did they make me do it ?
Why did they ruin my life ?
I'm about to go to prison
for the people you worship.
You murdered Jordan ?
I didn't mean...
i didn't even know what
i was doing, Shawn. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Kyle...
Stop... Shawn...
what are you doing ? Stop it.
You're killing me. Shawn...
i'm freeing you.
Freeing...
just hold on.
It's working.
I'm going to get it out of you.
Just hold on.
Hold on, Kyle. It's working.
You really didn't have
to do this, you know.
Actually...
i really think i needed to.
Ha...
What ?
Well,
you're supposed to say,
"i wanted to."
Oh, oh...
Yeah.
Don't push your luck.
Whoa.
uh,
looks like they're talking about
charging these people with murder.
Ryland. The whole crew.
Looks like mommy's going to get
a whole bunch of new bosses.
Well, i hope they go away for a very long time.
I'll be in the front row at the hearings.
Guess i have to buy a suit.
I'm going to be sitting next to you
until the whole thing is over.
Nothing's over.
It's just starting.
Sweetie, what are you talking about ?
What's starting ?
The war.
Kyle...
i'm ready.
Are you sure ?
Yeah.
I'll come with you.
Hello ?
Isabelle ?
Isabelle ?
hello, Shawn.
I'm Isabelle.

Merci aux Fantastic4400 pour cette saison
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>
[tom]:
They just arrested a suspect
in the collier killing.
Roy marsden didn't kill
jordan collier.
And neither did you, kyle.
Son of a bitch!
You go and you
tell your daddy
that he didn't kill anybody.
If maia's having visions,
you should know about it,
and you should know
what they are.
<i>[Maia]: mommy's bosses
will be punished</i>
<i>for betraying us.</i>
I want to go home.
I know you do, honey,
but dr. Hudson is going to take
very good care of you.
Don't tell anyone
i can't heal.
Sure.
What are you going to do?
What i have to.
<i>[Richard]:
If you're sick,</i>
<i>the responsible thing
is to report to ntac,</i>
but if you are well...
walking into quarantine
is an easy step,
but walking out, that might be
considerably more difficult.
There's a synthetic substance
present in the blood
of every 4400.
They even gave it a name.
They call it...
"promicin inhibitor."
Every time
they came to ntac medical,
every checkup.
Your daughter
is the rosetta stone
for understanding
what happened to the 4400.
We're her parents.
We decide.
Are you sure
you want to do this?
Just get me and isabelle
someplace safe.
But if it comes down
to a choice
between the safety
of the american people
and the welfare
of the 4400,
tom...
that's no choice at all.
We tried being reasonable.
In 10 hours,
we start rounding them up.
[Siren wailing]
[Grunts]
Easy, mccullough.
Let me go! I'm not sick!
There's nothing wrong with me!
We know that,
but you're a 4400,
and everybody's
got to go in.
Come on...
now, i don't want
to cuff you,
but if you run again,
you're going to
give me no choice.
"Quarantine"
is just a word to you guys.
Try living it.
Come on.
What are we
doing here, diana?
This is so wrong.
All right,
what do you suggest?
We walk into
the middle of ntac,
and shout out,
"we did this.
We made them sick."
Yeah, yeah, that's good start.
We've got the medical records.
We can take them to dennis.
You really think that max hudson
and a couple of rogue doctors
hatched a covert plan
to poison the 4400?
I mean, you really think
that they could do that
without approval?
Whose approval?
Dennis ryland's, for one.
He was the head
of this division
when this whole thing
started.
I mean, you think
he didn't know?
Until we know
how far up this goes,
we've got to stay calm,
work quietly...
and watch our backs.
Don't tell me to calm down,
lily.
How am i supposed to be calm
when my wife and daughter
left in the middle of the night?
We didn't leave you, richard.
I just didn't feel
like isabelle was safe there.
<i>You've turned this
resisting quarantine</i>
<i>into your
personal mission.</i>
Ntac turned it
into my personal mission
when they started
rounding us up.
<i>And i admire
what you're doing,</i>
but it's not my fight,
and i sure as hell won't let it
become isabelle's fight.
Just tell me where you are.
<i>Put my mind at ease.</i>
<i>I'll come see you.</i>
Lily?
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
I just feel like
it's better this way for now.
<i>I'll call soon.</i>
That didn't go as well
as mommy hoped.
<i>911. please state
the nature of...</i>
i need an ambulance.
I'm... i'm sick.
I've got this...
<i>hello?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Miss, are you there?</i>
Never mind.
Think they're sharing
trade secrets?
Either that,
or she's asking
for her office back.
After you.
Thanks.
Nina.
Good to see you.
Thanks.
I wish the circumstances
were a little better.
We lost the first 4400s
to this thing
overnight.
Seven dead.
There'll be more
by day's end.
No word about a vaccine,
a cure?
[Jarvis]: I just got
off the phone with hudson.
He said that they've worked
on a few things overnight.
I'm going to quarantine.
Diana...
i know this is frustrating,
but we've got
the best minds in the country,
in the world,
working on this.
Well, they better work fast.
Seven people are dead.
Alana could be next,
or maia,
and still,
nobody has any idea
where this came from, do they?
We'll get it figured out.
Hey, sweetie.
It's me, tom.
Who are you?
[Weakly]:
Who are you?
She was awake earlier.
Only for a few
minutes, though.
Did she say anything?
She talked about you.
Said you were going to
make everything okay.
I hope she's right.
Me too.
Let's go.
Where are we headed?
We've got
an appointment
with the good doctor
hudson.
Diana, what...
what the hell
are you doing?
We've got some things
we need to talk about.
* so long ago, another life *
* i can feel your heart beat *
* it's not a dream
remember us *
* i can see it in your eyes *
* we'll find our place in time *
* our place in time
beyond the sun *
* we'll find our place in time *
* our place in time
to call our own *
?????
This guy your agents brought in,
orson bailey,
i think i can explain
how he developed this...
jesus,
i can't even say the word.
Telekinesis.
Thank you.
The body produces four
main neurotransmitters.
They're like traffic cops
to the brain.
They control everything,
regulate everything.
Tell me something i don't know.
Bailey is producing
a fifth neurotransmitter.
We've never seen it before.
Nobody has.
I'm guessing
it factors into bailey's ability
to bend spoons with his mind.
Let's just say
promicin
is basically a backstage pass
to the v.i.p. Section
of the brain.
He is using
parts of the cerebellum
no human has ever had access to.
I ran some tests
on the 4400s
who are still
in quarantine.
Every single one of them
is producing trace amounts
of promicin.
So it's just a matter of time
before every 4400
develops telekinesis?
Promicin's behavior
is unpredictable.
They might not get telekinesis,
but they'll get something.
Put everything on paper.
I want to get
my talking points straight
before i try to explain this
to d.c.
D.c. Panicked.
I was ordered to work on a drug
to suppress
the production of promicin
in the 4400.
Once i synthesized
the inhibitor,
we gave it to every 4400,
every time they came in
for a checkup.
But it doesn't even work.
4400s are developing abilities
all the time.
A small percentage of them are,
but if it wasn't
for the inhibitor,
they'd all have them.
I know it didn't
work perfectly.
"Perfectly?"
Seven 4400s died last night.
It was your inhibitor
that did it.
You made them sick!
You think
i don't know that?
We weren't trying
to kill anyone.
We were preserving
the status quo,
doing a good thing.
I guess it backfired.
I am trying to undo it,
but if you want to
pull that trigger,
please, be my guest.
Maybe then
finally i'll get some sleep.
All right.
If you're not going to shoot me,
let me get back to work.
I don't want anyone else to die.
Alison?
What are you doing here?
They're going to
give roy life.
They're going to
give him life,
and he's
going to take it.
What are you
talking about?
The state was going to go
for the death penalty,
and the public defender
convinced roy
to take a plea bargain.
But they've got no case
against him.
My dad told me.
I don't know.
This lawyer,
he's handling, like,
10 different cases,
and he just
doesn't want to see
the inside
of a courtroom.
I don't know.
But he didn't do it, okay?
He didn't kill jordan collier.
You keep saying that.
Does your dad know something?
What?
Is there evidence
that they're hiding?
What?
You have to tell me.
If roy takes this deal,
he can't even get parole
for 20 years.
He's not going to prison.
Why?
The 4400 came back august 14th.
Hudson discovered promicin
october 11th.
So they probably gave
the first doses
of the inhibitor
sometime around
the end of the month.
But we have every
internal document
for october.
There's nothing
about any of this.
There's hardly even
a mention of orson bailey.
We both wrote reports
about him, diana.
They're gone.
They were hoping
that was going to be
the only extrahuman ability
ever developed in a 4400.
If they destroy
all records of it...
nobody would ever know.
But this went to the top
of the food chain.
Here.
Britain, france,
korea...
everywhere there's a sick 4400.
There has to be a paper trail.
Does it even matter?
I mean,
we could find a memo
signed by the entire
united nations security council.
It's not going to cure anyone.
Diana, we delivered
confidential medical records
to dr. Burkhoff.
We've got the so-called
"father of 4400 technology"
working on the case,
and you just
stuck a gun
to the head of ntac's
medical director.
We've done everything we can
to get the right people
working on a cure.
That's if ntac
even wants a cure.
Ryland's been talking
about people in d.c.
Who've been on a wartime footing
for months.
This is nothing
but a stroke of luck for them.
You think
they want them all dead?
I told you!
I told you
i wasn't safe here.
It's just a precaution, kevin.
We think
you'll just be safer
if you move to
a less exposed location.
It's because
i told you
about that inhibitor
thing, right?
I spent six years
in a psychiatric hospital
suffering from paranoid
personality disorder.
As soon as i get out,
you two put me
smack in the middle
of a massive
conspiracy.
Dr. Burkhoff's been spinning
all kinds of stories about ntac.
Very interesting stuff.
Well, he can spin
all the theories
he wants,
just not here.
I'll make sure
he has a safe place to work.
I figured out what promicin is.
That's the name they gave
the neurotransmitter,
right?
The one that gives the 4400
their abilities?
And if i can find
one 4400
that hasn't been exposed
to the inhibitor,
i think i can neutralize it.
Hey.
You scared me.
Why didn't you use
your key?
Oh, sorry.
My hands were full.
I brought you guys
some supplies.
You still like chocolate cherry?
That sounds great. Thank you.
Oh...
you okay?
Yeah, just jumpy.
It's so quiet out here.
Yeah, a lot of places
have closed up for the season.
Oh, i thought that, uh...
maybe i could stay for
a little dinner or something.
You don't have to
get back home?
No, not really.
Carol's gone.
She found out
that you and i
were talking.
Don't worry,
she doesn't know you're here,
but she got mad.
Brian, i'm sorry.
She'll stay away
for a few nights.
I'll stay on the couch
for a while...
but in the meantime,
heidi's staying with a friend,
and i figured,
why eat alone?
Sure,
but i hope
you're not expecting much.
I haven't made pot roast
in a while.
You know, lily,
the truth is...
i never
should have married carol
in the first place.
What are you doing, brian?
Come on.
I'm alone.
You're alone.
You and richard aren't happy.
That's not true.
We could have it back, lily.
Don't, brian.
Why are you
fighting it?
Brian, stop it!
Let me go!
I don't want to hurt you, lily!
Stop it!
You little bitch.
Hello?
<i>[Brian]: lily?
Are you okay?</i>
Brian?
<i>Yeah, i was going to
bring by some food.</i>
Don't.
Something's not right here.
I haven't heard
from the safe house
in wheeling
for a day.
We have to assume
it's been compromised.
That's the third one
that's gone silent.
They're picking us off
one by one.
We might want to think
about fighting back.
We can do that, richard.
We certainly have 4400s
that can do some damage,
but once
we take that step,
there's no turning back.
Excuse me,
but shouldn't there be
bars on these windows?
The point is
to be unobtrusive,
dr. Burkhoff.
Well, this seems
a little lax to me.
Most of you are 4400s.
I'm a collaborator.
You know what they do
to collaborators?
[Quietly]:
We need to get him working.
It calms him down considerably.
We cleared out a room for you.
Anything you need,
just let us know.
What i need is a clean 4400,
one that hasn't been exposed
to the inhibitor.
I don't guess
you've got one of those, do you?
Actually, i might.
20 years,
i've never seen you pour a drink
on government property.
I never supervised a round-up
of innocent citizens before.
Conscience bothering you,
dennis?
Hell, yes...
it is...
and given the circumstances,
i'd say that's a good sign,
but i'm trying to focus
on my job, tom...
and i need the same from you.
But sometimes when you...
you look for one thing,
you...
you learn something else.
You know how it is, dennis.
<i>[Ryland]:
I know exactly what you mean.</i>
<i>I've learned some things
myself.</i>
Open it.
Knowledge is a burden, huh, tom?
<i>Did you think</i>
<i>that i would release kyle
from quarantine</i>
<i>and not keep an eye on him?</i>
Why didn't you stop this?
Because i didn't know
exactly what kyle
was going to do.
I just sort of let the future
play out.
Isn't that what
you're always talking about?
You set up roy marsden.
That was my gift to you, tom.
Would you rather
i just turn these over
to my bosses?
I would rather
you be the friend...
you be the ryland
i worked with for 20 years.
I haven't changed.
I have a tough job,
and i'm doing my best,
and as your boss,
and as your friend,
i expect support.
Kyle hated quarantine.
???????
They know.
Ntac knows
you shot collier.
What? How?
They've known all along.
They let it happen.
I need you to be ready
to get out of here.
I'm going to call
alana's friends.
You're sending me to spain?
If they come
after you,
i need you to be ready
to leave right away.
Did you hear roy marsden's
being sent to jail for life?
They set him up.
But if i run...
just one thing at a time, kyle.
Let me worry about you,
then i will deal with marsden.
So you want me
to start packing?
Yeah, kyle!
Aren't you
hearing me?
[Diana]: He committed suicide?
I know that max was under
a lot of strain, but...
he had
all those people's lives
in his hands.
Maia's...
i know,
but dr. Pinero's been
hudson's number two
from the very beginning.
He knows everything
that hudson knew.
We're still going to
beat this thing.
Good morning, tom.
Nina.
Here.
I grabbed this
out of your mail cubby.
Did you hear
about hudson?
Yeah.
You okay?
They're calling it
a suicide.
What are you calling it?
Tom, look at this.
It's from max.
"Firewall memo."
What is that?
I don't know.
Why are you doing this,
isabelle?
Mommy needs to know.
I brought you here
so we could be safe.
Don't you want that?
[Pounding on door]
Lily, what's going on
out here?
You okay?
No. Go away!
I told you not to come here!
That's why i'm here.
Lily, please, let me in.
How do i know you're real?
What are you
talking about?
Of course i'm real.
Did carol leave you?
Why would she leave me?
Lily, i'm coming in,
okay?
No. No!
No!
Lily... whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.
Lily...
put down the knife. Please.
I just came
to check on you guys,
make sure
you were okay.
Look, it's me.
Brian.
Put the knife down.
Lily, we're all going to die.
Is that what you want?
No!
Stop it, isabelle!
Lily, i heard screaming.
What is going on?
Brian...
if you're real,
you've got to get me out.
Isabelle
doesn't want to be here.
Firewall...
it's a program,
a safety net.
That's how
you keep viruses
off your hard drive.
Okay, did you ever see a memo
with the word "firewall"
written in the subject line?
No, but i don't read
most of the memos
that circulate
around here anyway.
Look, how long
are you guys
going to be
working in here?
What, are they painting
your offices?
We need a little privacy, okay?
Tom, this memo,
whatever it is,
i doubt it ever went out
on a general distribution,
and every copy probably went
through the shredder
months ago.
So if there's no hard copy,
and if marco is the only one
we even trust
to even
talk about it with,
then we're at a dead end.
We could always
march into ryland's office
and ask him about it.
[Marco]: The guy
does know memos.
When he was working here,
i must have thrown away,
like, 15 every day.
More like 20.
He liked to
keep his keyboard burning.
Who, ryland?
Yeah.
He didn't type.
He used to
call me in sometimes
when he froze up
his computer.
Hunt-and-peck city.
Took him 10 minutes
to type in an email address.
Ryland dictated everything
to his secretary.
She had "l" level
security clearance.
Look.
"D.r. /j.o."
Everything says
"d.r. /j.o."
"D.r.,"
dennis ryland.
And "j.o." is jane orman.
She worked for him
for 22 years.
Did she stay in seattle?
Say hi for me.
Lily.
You came back.
Are you all right?
[Lily]: I thought
i was doing
the smart thing,
but isabelle...
what happened?
She just wanted to be with you,
and this place...
i don't know.
Hey.
Did you miss daddy?
Yeah?
Well,
he missed you.
Both of you.
Listen, i'm, uh...
i'm going to take off.
Brian...
thank you...
for everything.
Hey, uh...
do me a favor...
forget this address,
forget about
all of us,
and i'll forget
you drove off with my wife
in the middle
of the night.
Good luck, lil.
Hey, i've been
calling you all day.
There's a guy here
who thinks that isabelle...
excuse me.
Didn't anyone hear
that car pull up...
is that her?
I think
there's somebody here
who wants to meet you.
This is isabelle.
What are we
supposed to say?
"You know that
massive conspiracy
"to suppress
the abilities
"of the 4400?
"We were just
kind of hoping
you would fill us in
on the particulars."
Yeah,
"and don't be nervous,
"but we had to shake
a government tail
on the way here
to do it."
Yeah, sounds
like a start.
Tom baldwin.
Long time, jane.
Do you remember my partner,
diana skouris?
Of course.
Yeah. Hi.
I always wondered
who would show up.
I should have figured
it'd be the two of you.
You're here about firewall,
right?
????
The inhibitor
hasn't been tested.
It is not ready.
[Ryland]:
One of the 4400
is a serial killer
who was using,
i don't know,
some kind
of mind control
to get people
to commit murder.
The inhibitor's ready.
This is wrong, dennis.
We are beyond
right and wrong here!
There's no precedent for this.
Now, d.c.'s been advised
of the operation.
It's been approved
at the highest level.
There is nothing further
to discuss, is there?
I am not doing this.
I took it home with me
that night.
The next day,
i put in my notice.
I mean, you have to understand,
for two decades,
i thought that dennis ryland
was the finest man i ever met,
and after i read this,
i couldn't work for him anymore.
I kept telling myself
i should send it somewhere...
the newspapers, or...
i don't know...
but the names
that signed off
on this...
i was just a secretary.
What could i do
against those names?
It's all here.
Did you see the names?
When maia said,
"mommy's bosses are
going to be punished,"
i had no idea
she meant
all the way up
the chain of command.
We can't go public yet.
What?
We can't go public yet.
Listen, the faster
this gets exposed,
the better it is
for maia, alana, shawn...
all of them.
No more secrets.
No more relying
on the people who did this
to find a cure.
At the very least,
they're going to
have to rescind
the quarantine order.
Diana,
ryland's got something on me.
Ryland?
This entire memo
is over his signature.
What could he possibly
have over you?
He knows
kyle killed jordan collier.
What?
That night
on highland beach,
they put someone inside of him,
or some program...
i don't know...
directing his actions,
and ryland has evidence.
I'm sorry, tom,
but i can't just sit on this!
Maia's getting sicker!
Just give me one hour, diana.
Just one hour.
Please.
Stop saying that.
It's not okay, kyle.
If i go through
with this,
they're going to
come after you,
and it doesn't matter
if you're in spain
or siberia.
I know, but with all those lives
at stake,
you have to do it.
Okay, i'm taking you
to the airport.
Dad...
i'm not going anywhere.
This actually makes it easier.
I didn't know
how i was going to tell you.
Tell me what?
I can't live like this anymore.
I can't live
knowing that guy is in jail.
I go through every day
trying to pretend
it's all normal,
but it's just a cover-up.
I can't let you do it, kyle.
Marsden shot at me.
He, uh...
he shot at other cops too.
Even if you confess, kyle,
he is still going to jail.
You try to bury stuff like this,
it changes you.
Look what it did
to your boss.
Ryland used to be your friend.
It's over, dad.
No more lies.
I can't do it anymore.
I just can't do it.
Okay? You can't stop me.
Okay?
Don't you do anything
until i get back.
You hear me?
[Ryland]: This is
the right thing,
the heroic thing,
and being a hero
comes with some perks.
You tell me
what i need to know,
i'll see that
you're transferred
to a private
quarantine facility
this afternoon.
You can
walk the grounds,
you can choose
your own meals...
what's wrong with that?
139 lebanon street.
That's where
they told me to go.
The inhibitor
is piggybacking
on glucose.
It enters the brain
through facilitated
diffusion.
It's a binding protein.
That's how
they did it...
i'll take your word for it.
But this serum
has pure promicin
in it.
It can neutralize the charge.
The inhibitor won't be able
to cross membranes anymore.
We can flush it
out of their systems.
So once it's gone,
the disease goes away?
Please.
Stop saying "disease."
For the last time,
it's a side effect.
Remove the inhibitor,
the immune system functions.
It'll happen
virtually instantly.
So this substance...
promicin.
It's what makes you people
unique.
How did you get it
out of my daughter?
She has trace amounts of it
in her bloodstream.
Before the inhibitor,
you all did.
That's how they found it
in the first place...
but...
she's an infant.
I could only draw
enough blood...
to make one shot.
If you can get that
into quarantine,
one shot might be all you need.
Nina, where's ryland?
A 4400 gave up
the seattle safe house.
They're on their way
to take it down.
Excuse me.
Please don't shoot.
Dr. Burkhoff,
why would we shoot you?
I have no idea,
but i'm feeling
a little insecure right now.
I brought something
for you.
Whatever you do, don't drop it.
<i>Everybody in this house</i>
<i>is subject
to quarantine and arrest</i>
<i>under emergency order 74.</i>
<i>You have five minutes
to come out peacefully.</i>
<i>If not,</i>
<i>we'll come in and get you.</i>
There's an army out there.
Ryland!
Call it off.
It's over.
Quarantine. Everything.
Agent baldwin
is obstructing justice.
Arrest him.
I don't think so,
dennis.
????
Keep your weapon on him.
You're really willing
to give up your son?
Kyle's turning himself in.
He can't live with the cover-up.
When i wrote that memo,
we had no idea where
the 4400 were from
or why they were
brought back.
Dr. Hudson
gave me information.
I acted on it, tom.
If you were in my chair,
you'd have done the same thing.
Hi.
I've got some
medicine for you.
To be honest with you,
i'd rather be giving this
to maia,
but a crazy neuroscientist
told me
that that was not
the right thing to do,
so if you don't mind
holding still
for a minute...
you saw orson bailey
up close and personal.
Oliver knox.
You know what these people
were capable of.
Hell, i attached your reports
to the memo
when i sent it to d.c.
But we learned better, dennis.
Highland beach?
"Save the future?"
Heartfelt message, tom,
and while they were
giving it to you,
they were
programming your son
to commit murder.
Does that sound to you
like they were
guiding us toward eden?
I don't know,
but i sure as hell
don't want to go
where you're taking me.
Goddammit, tom!
What does it even mean,
"save the future?"
Save the future how?
Kill us all?
Start over
with a smaller,
more evolved
population?
Is that an outcome
you can live with?
What can you
live with, dennis?
Was max hudson really a suicide,
or did you pull
that little string too?
And what about me,
dennis?
Because if you're
holding on to any hope
of keeping this covered up,
you're going to have to start
by putting me in the ground
right here and right now.
<i>[Ryland]: tom, you're reducing
the fate of the planet</i>
<i>to a question
of your personal faith.</i>
<i>Without the inhibitor program,</i>
<i>who the hell knows
what'll happen?</i>
Who the hell ever knows?
Very wise.
Pithy.
But if the world
turns out to be a place
of unchecked
4400 abilities,
i hope we don't live
to regret it.
Stand down!
We're done here.
You can all go home now.
Thomas.
Alana.
Alana.
What happened here?
A miracle.
Welcome home, baby.
Home...
i never even unpacked.
We'll take care of that
right now.
Where's kyle?
I can't wait
to see him.
Yeah, i told him
you were coming home.
Hey, kyle!
We're back!
Hey, kyle.
Man, i never thought
i was going
to see you again.
You're okay, right?
I feel like i did
15 keg stands last night,
but yeah,
pretty much.
We all are.
Dr. Burkhoff
took blood samples
from the people that i healed.
Every sample he gets
cures someone else, so...
hey, you guys
kind of lucked out, huh?
"Lucked out?"
There's 23 of us dead,
and they don't even have
a final count yet.
I don't think that was
part of the plan,
you know?
That's not why
they brought us back.
This whole idea
that there's some kind
of plan...
i don't know.
I wish
i could believe that.
Just trust me when i say
that there's a plan,
it's important,
and every 4400 is a part of it.
Shawn...
i killed jordan collier.
[Softly]: What?
I bought a rifle,
i went up on that roof,
took out two government agents,
and then i shot him.
Remember
when i was in trouble?
Losing chunks of time?
That's what i was doing.
Planning out an assassination.
Why?
You think i know?
There's something inside me,
shawn...
or someone.
It takes over.
Those people
who took you?
If they have a plan,
it includes
me killing jordan collier.
That's not true, kyle!
Then why did they
make me do it?
Why did they
ruin my life?
I'm about
to go to prison
for the people
you worship.
You murdered jordan?
I didn't mean...
i didn't even know
what i was doing, shawn.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Kyle...
Stop... shawn...
what are you doing?
Stop it.
You're killing me.
Shawn...
i'm freeing you.
Freeing.
Freeing...
just hold on.
It's working.
Hold on.
I'm going to get it out of you.
Just hold on.
Hold on, kyle. It's working.
[Marco]: You really
didn't have to do this,
you know.
Actually...
i really think i needed to.
What?
Well, you're supposed to say,
"i wanted to."
Yeah.
Don't push your luck.
Whoa.
uh, looks like they're talking
about charging these people
with murder.
Ryland. The whole crew.
Looks like
mommy's going to get
a whole bunch of new bosses.
Well, i hope they go away
for a very long time.
I'll be in the front row
at the hearings.
Guess i have to buy a suit.
I'm going to be
sitting next to you
until the whole thing
is over.
Nothing's over.
It's just starting.
Sweetie,
what are you talking about?
What's starting?
The war.
Kyle...
i'm ready.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I'll come with you.

RETOUR A NOTRE EPOQUE
<i>Peut-on la comparer à la comète</i>

<i>Cette comète est un peu plus petite</i>

Hé, petit. Tu rates quelque chose.
C'est une grosse comète.
Selon la NASA,

Je savais bien
que ça ne marcherait pas.
Bonjour.
- Comment va-t-il ?
- Pareil.
Aucun changement.

J'appellerai la poste.
Bonjour, mon coeur.
Je ne t'ai pas vue ces derniers jours.
Je ne viens plus tous les jours.

Alors quoi ?
On est censés se résigner ?
Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
Linda, attends. Linda !

Mais ce n'était pas lui, n'est-ce pas ?
Même si tu retrouves Shawn,
ça ne réveillera pas Kyle pour autant.
- Au moins, j'aurai des réponses.
- Tu m'inquiètes, Tom.
Trouver Shawn et découvrir
ce qui lui est arrivé, c'est mon boulot.
Tu le sais bien.
Tu as l'air fatigué.
Essaie de te reposer.
N'est-on pas là pour la comète ?
Ah oui, la comète !
C'est normal qu'elle brille autant ?
- Skouris.
- <i>Venez sur-le-champ.</i>
MINISTERE DE LA SECURITE
INTERIEURE, BUREAU DE SEATTLE
C'est mauvais signe.
Etat d'alerte nucléaire maximal.
Voici les ordres du ministère.
Assurer la sécurité de l'aéroport SeaTac
et maintenir les avions au sol.
Rassembler tous les dignitaires
étrangers du coin.
Faites de même avec les élus
et mettez-les aux abris.
- Sid, où en est-on ?
- La comète a changé de trajectoire.
Elle se dirige droit sur nous.
Chef, elle change encore de cap.
- Ça n'arrive jamais.
- A croire que si.
- Ce n'est pas une comète.
- Vélocité ?
- 3 000 km/s.
- Combien de temps avons-nous ?
- Impact dans 28 minutes.
- Chef.
Ryland.
Compris.
La Chine a lancé ses missiles.
Tenez-vous prêts, ça va être à nous.
<i>L'armée américaine a lancé</i>
<i>une salve de 2 4 missiles Titan-2.</i>
Danny, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Très bien, nos missiles sont lancés.
- L'Angleterre a suivi.
- La France et la Russie aussi.
Les premiers missiles atteindront
la cible dans 15 secondes.
9... 8... 7...
6... 5... 4...
3... 2... 1...
Rentrons.
Cible touchée. Je crois qu'ils l'ont eue.
<i>Au moins neuf missiles ont atteint</i>
<i>leur cible. La comète a...</i>
- Elle est encore là.
- Magnitude de l'impact ?
Vu sa taille et sa vitesse...
Mieux vaut ne pas savoir.
Mieux vaut ne pas savoir.
J'ai peur.
Je retourne voir mes parents.
Papa, si tu es là, peux-tu répondre ?
C'est Diana. Tu sais, ta fille ?
- Dis à mon frère que je l'aime.
- Surtout dis à maman que je l'aime.
Nancy, c'est papa.
Je voulais juste te dire
que je t'aime.
<i>Un impact avec la Terre est...</i>
Tom, c'est Susan.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Trouve-nous un abri.
Tu travailles toujours pour le ministère.
Susan, ça ne servirait à rien.
Un abri ne fera aucune différence.
Va juste...
Je regrette. Je t'aime, soeurette.
Prends Danny dans tes bras
et garde espoir.
Le missile britannique
n'a pas réussi à freiner sa course.
- Elle est entrée dans l'atmosphère.
- Je l'ai sur radar.
- Elle ralentit.
- Quoi ?
Mach 7. Mach 2.
Elle passe en vitesse subsonique.
Elle ralentit.
Comme si elle se préparait à atterrir.
- Quoi ? Comme un avion ?
- Non, plutôt comme un vaisseau.
Coordonnées ?
Vers quoi se dirige-t-elle ?
4 7° de longitude nord,
122° ou 123° de latitude ouest.
C'est le mont Rainier.
C'est notre secteur.
Vas-y, ne la rate pas !
Nous sommes au mont Rainier.
La boule de lumière est énorme.
Elle fait entre 30 et 60 mètres
de diamètre. Difficile à dire.
<i>Je peux vous dire,</i>
<i>sans l'ombre d'un doute,</i>
<i>que c'est la chose la plus incroyable</i>
<i>que j'aie jamais vue.</i>
<i>Nous essayons de trouver</i>
<i>un représentant du gouvernement.</i>
<i>Jim ?</i>
<i>Jim, que se passe-t-il ?</i>
<i>Nous ne sommes pas sûrs.</i>
<i>La boule de lumière a disparu.</i>
<i>Des milliers de personnes viennent</i>
<i>d'apparaître. C'est incroyable.</i>
<i>Il y a des milliers de gens.</i>
- Je crois... Je viens de voir ton frère !
- Shawn ?
Oui !
Sortez-moi tous les dossiers
des comtés du nord.
Je veux reprendre du service.
As-tu la moindre idée du pétrin
dans lequel je me trouve ?
Plus de 4 000 personnes tout droit
sorties d'une boule me tombent dessus.
Certains ont disparu il y a 60 ans,
mais ils ne se souviennent de rien.
- Tu crois que j'ai le temps ?
- Je t'aiderai.
C'était avant
que j'avais besoin d'aide.
Quand le ministère m'a demandé
qui je voulais du FBI,
j'ai mis ton nom en tête de liste.
- Et que m'as-tu donné en retour ?
- Cinq mois.
Cinq mois.
Avant de t'évanouir dans la nature.
Tu nous as tournés en ridicule.
Je devais découvrir la vérité
sur mon fils.
Voilà pourquoi tu veux revenir.
Ton neveu fait partie des enlevés.
C'est vrai,
j'ai des raisons personnelles.
Je serai utile parce que moi aussi,
je veux la vérité.
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
Vous enquêterez
sur le retour des enlevés.
- Skouris. Ex-CDC ?
- J'ai aussi entendu parler de vous.
- C'est une plaisanterie ?
- Quel est le problème ?
Il a disparu une fois.
Qui dit qu'il ne recommencera pas ?
Moi.
Vous allez me faire
un discours sur l'obéissance ?
Vous êtes ma meilleure scientifique
de terrain
et Tom est mon meilleur enquêteur.
Ensemble,
vous formerez une excellente équipe.
Eh bien, on ne devrait pas s'ennuyer.
Enchanté, moi aussi.
Parfait. Plus tôt on découvrira de quoi
il en retourne, mieux ce sera pour nous.
Et mieux ce sera pour eux.
- Votre nom ?
- Julius.
- Anita.
- Amanda.
<i>Je veux voir ma famille.</i>
<i>Orson Bailey.</i>
- <i>C'est impossible.</i>
- <i>Très bien. En 19 79.</i>
- Pour eux, le temps s'est arrêté.
- <i>C'était notre anniversaire hier.</i>
Où penses-tu qu'ils soient allés ?
Ce doit être le fait
d'une sorte d'intelligence.
Est-ce la main de Dieu
ou des petits hommes verts ?
Je n'écarte rien. Regarde.
Voilà un cas intéressant.
- <i>Ils sont morts, n'est-ce pas ?</i>
- C'est Maia Rutledge.
Elle a été la première à disparaître. Elle
a 8 ans, sauf qu'elle est née en 1938.
<i>Ça ira. Dans l'ensemble.</i>
C'est une petite fille très forte.
Il y a un enlevé
que je veux interroger.
Oui, je suis au courant.
Enlevé 2117.
Shawn Farrell. Il est tout à toi.
<i>Nous voulons les voir.</i>
<i>Ils méritent de voir leur famille</i>
<i>et d'être représentés par un avocat.</i>
- <i>Ils n'ont rien fait de mal.</i>
- <i>Nous l'ignorons.</i>
<i>Ils pourraient exploser, être porteurs</i>
<i>de maladies, être des espions.</i>
Elle ne nous aime pas beaucoup.
C'est réciproque.
- Un secrétaire d'Etat de couleur ?
- Noir. Je te crois sur parole.
Le conseiller à la Sécurité aussi ?
Le monde a bien changé depuis 1951.
Tu devrais essayer de te calmer.
Creuser un sillon dans le sol
ne t'aidera pas à sortir plus vite.
- Tu es un prisonnier philosophe ?
- Un militaire philosophe.
J'étais pilote de chasse en Corée.
- Joli tatouage. Qui est Lily ?
- Une fille de l'époque.
<i>Shawn Farrell, parloir n</i>° <i>1.</i>
A plus.
- Votre nom, monsieur ?
- Orson Bailey.
Je veux parler à l'un de vos supérieurs.
Je veux téléphoner.
Oncle Tommy ! Bonjour !
Je suis content de te voir !
C'est quoi, tout ça ?
Personne ne nous dit rien.
Dès qu'on en saura plus,
vous serez mis au courant.
- Je n'arrive pas à croire que c'est toi.
- Moi non plus.
Combien de temps va-t-on rester ici ?
J'ai vraiment envie de rentrer.
Shawn...
Te souviens-tu de ce qui s'est passé
cette nuit-là ?
Rien.
Rien.
Je suis assis sur la plage avec Kyle
et l'instant d'après, trois ans ont passé
et je suis au pied d'une montagne
au milieu
de plusieurs milliers d'étrangers.
Ecoute, oncle Tommy,
il y en a qui disent que...
des extraterrestres nous ont enlevés.
On ne peut pas écarter cette possibilité.
Tu n'as rien à raconter ?
- Comment va maman ? Et Danny ?
- Bien.
- Tu leur manques.
- Tant mieux.
Et Kyle ? Il a dû voir quelque chose,
la nuit de ma disparition.
Que t'a-t-il dit ?
- Il n'a pas dit un mot.
- Il va bien, pas vrai ?
- Non ?
- Kyle est dans le coma, Shawn.
Que veux-tu dire ?
Kyle est dans un lit. Il mange
par un tube et pisse par un autre.
Il est dans cet état
depuis ta disparition.
Il allait bien.
On avait bu quelques bières.
- Ne mens pas !
- Je ne mens pas.
Trois ans que j'attends
d'entendre la vérité de ta bouche,
alors ne me mens pas.
Je t'ai dit la vérité.
Voilà ce que tu as cru
pendant tout ce temps ?
Que j'avais filé une vacherie à Kyle
avant de m'enfuir ?
Va te faire foutre, oncle Tommy.
Je t'ai dit tout ce que je sais.
Nom de Dieu !
Vous semblez vous ennuyer
autant que moi.
Si seulement il y avait des fenêtres.
J'aimerais voir les étoiles. Pas vous ?
- Fais-je tellement peur à voir ?
- Non, c'est que...
C'est juste
que vous me rappelez quelqu'un.
- Quand avez-vous disparu ?
- En 1951.
Alors ça ne peut pas être moi.
1993.
- Richard.
- Lily.
Mon amie s'appelait aussi Lily.
Lily Bonham.
C'est le nom de ma grand-mère.
- Lily Bonham de St Louis ?
- Vous avez connu ma grand-mère ?
- Est-elle toujours en vie ?
- Je suis désolée.
Elle était déjà morte à ma naissance.
Ça va ?
Lily est morte et me voilà assis
avec sa petite-fille.
Tout ça n'a vraiment aucun sens.
Je ressens la même chose.
J'ai l'impression que je vais me réveiller
et raconter ce rêve à mon mari.
- Vous avez une famille ?
- Oui.
Brian, moi et notre fille, Heidi.
Elle avait six mois quand j'ai...
Alors, comment était-elle ?
Ma grand-mère ?
Tout le monde dit que je lui ressemble.
Ils ont raison.
- C'est impossible pour l'instant.
- C'est ridicule.
Vous n'avez aucun droit de nous retenir.
Nous n'avons rien fait.
Désolé.
Tenez.
On les laisse partir ? Ils ne sont là
que depuis 6 semaines. C'est trop tôt.
L'organisation de défense des libertés
individuelles a fait un procès.
- Ce serait illégal de les garder.
- Certains n'ont nulle part où aller.
L'Egypte et la Chine ne rapatrieront
personne. L'Inde est indécise.
Ceux qui veulent rester
le peuvent.
Les citoyens américains qui partiront
recevront l'aide dont ils auront besoin
pour se réinsérer.
Soins médicaux, aides à l'emploi,
au logement, à la formation.
- Nous devons isoler ces gens.
- Ce ne sont pas des virus.
Le verdict a été rendu.
Il faut les laisser partir.
Ce n'est pas le moment
de partir en vacances.
Chaque bureau du ministère
sera responsable des enlevés
dans sa région.
Nous aurons 79 personnes
sous notre surveillance,
plus les 135 personnes qui ont choisi
de rester en quarantaine.
Chaque enlevé se présentera
chaque semaine.
Les difficultés qu'ils rencontreront
seront gérées par ce bureau.
Et pour finir,
nous continuerons notre enquête.
Nous dormirons mieux lorsque nous
saurons de quoi il en retourne. Merci.
Tu sembles perdu
sans ton immatriculation.
Je suis censé avoir 82 ans.
Je n'ai personne qui m'attend.
Que vas-tu faire ?
Retourner dans mon ancien quartier,
j'imagine. Et toi ?
Ne dis rien. Laisse-moi deviner.
- Woodland Park avec ta fille ?
- On adorait cet endroit.
Heidi marchait à peine à quatre pattes
à l'époque. Maintenant, elle a 12 ans.
Tu as été une amie précieuse.
- Où est le bus qui va en ville ?
- Là-bas.
- Hé ! Maman ! Danny !
- Shawn !
Brian !
Pardon, je...
Allons-y.
- Je peux vous aider ?
- Heidi ?
- Oui.
- Heidi, c'est maman.
- Qui ?
- Heidi ?
C'est bon, ma chérie, je m'en occupe.
Brian.
Lily.
Tu n'as pas pris une ride.
Tu n'es pas venu me chercher.
Ils ne t'ont pas prévenu ?
Si.
Essaie de comprendre.
Je pensais ne jamais te revoir.
Je suis marié, Lily.
Carol est une très bonne mère
pour Heidi.
Nous avons aussi un petit garçon.
Je regrette, Lily, je...
Lily...
Elizabeth.
Orson ?
Où étais-tu passé ?
Je t'ai attendu.
Je sais.
Où est la voiture ?
Nous allons être en retard au restaurant.
Je regrette, ma chérie.
J'ai eu quelques ennuis.
Mais ça ne se reproduira pas.
- Bonjour, maman.
- C'est cool de te voir.
Salut, Joel. Content de te voir.
Tes potes n'ont pas pu venir, dommage.
Ils sont à la fac, j'imagine.
Ils sont jaloux que j'aie encore deux ans
à passer au lycée.
Le lycée n'est pas si mal.
Salut, Shawn.
- Tu me reconnais ?
- Nikki ?
Non !
Tu n'étais qu'une gamine
la dernière fois.
- J'ai de la chance, hein ?
- Oui, j'imagine.
Tu regardes quoi, au juste ?
- J'habitais là, avant.
- Ah oui ?
Eh bien, c'est chez moi, maintenant.
Allez, tire-toi.
- Pourquoi m'amener ici ?
- Pour que tu voies qu'ils sont humains.
Pour te rappeler que ces gens
ne sont pas des virus.
- Tom. Tu ne me présentes pas ?
- Ma partenaire. Enfin... ma collègue.
Diana Skouris.
Voici ma femme, Linda.
- Bonjour.
- Enchantée.
Nous sommes séparés.
Appelle-moi. Il faut qu'on parle.
- C'était un peu bizarre.
- Vraiment ? Je n'ai rien remarqué.
Je reviens.
- Tu as l'air d'avoir soif.
- Merci.
Je voulais te dire...
Je suis content que tu sois de retour.
C'est bon, oncle Tommy...
Nom de Dieu !
- Il s'est brisé le cou.
- Sans doute le reflet de la vitre.
Rejoins les autres à l'intérieur.
Cette fête est pour toi.
C'est un peu bizarre d'être ici.
- Il devait juste être étourdi.
- Oui.
- Ça doit être ça.
- A tout à l'heure.
Je dois vraiment revenir
chaque semaine ?
C'est vrai que ce n'est pas drôle,
mais...
au moins tu vas vivre
avec ce couple charmant.
C'est mieux qu'une couchette
en quarantaine, non ?
- Tout va bien se passer.
- Ce serait bien.
Allons-y. On a du chemin à faire.
Super. Bonne chance, Maia.
- On se reverra.
- Oui, la semaine prochaine.
Avant ça.
Quand on a acheté cet immeuble,
ta mère a dit : "Cette ruine ?"
- Vous buvez quelque chose ?
- De l'eau s'il te plaît.
Mary, un verre d'eau pour M. Bailey.
Par là.
Vous n'avez absolument pas changé
depuis la dernière fois.
Tu avais 13 ans. Ton père voulait
que je t'apprenne le métier.
J'ai bien fait mon travail.
- Asseyez-vous.
- Merci.
Que puis-je faire pour vous, M. Bailey ?
J'aimerais retrouver mon bureau,
une secrétaire, mes cartes de visite.
Je peux voir des clients
dans une semaine.
- Vous cherchez un emploi ?
- C'est bien Kensington & Bailey ?
C'est un peu gênant.
Les temps sont durs.
Je viens de licencier trois actuaires.
- Nous ne recrutons pas pour l'instant.
- Attends... Je suis associé ici.
Nous avons racheté votre participation
lorsque vous avez été déclaré mort.
Je ne suis pas mort.
- Tout est légal.
- N'en sois pas si sûr.
Ce qui m'est arrivé est sans précédent.
Il vous faudra des années
pour en établir un.
Et d'ici là, tous les... enlevés
devront faire la queue devant le juge.
- Avez-vous les moyens de... ?
- Tu as vu où est ma femme ?
Je dois la sortir de là.
J'ai besoin d'argent. Immédiatement.
Le salon. Et voilà la cuisine.
Tu veux voir ta chambre ?
C'est la pièce là-bas.
- Juste là.
- On vient de la refaire.
Cette chambre est très belle.
Je t'ai acheté des vêtements,
mais tu en choisiras d'autres demain.
D'accord.
Maia, ma chérie.
Nous avons une règle :
pas de chaussures sur les meubles.
- Elles vont être mouillées.
- Quoi ?
Pourquoi seraient-elles mouillées ?
Va donc te débarbouiller.
Nous allons bientôt manger.
MONSTRE
Anita ?
<i>Adam, c'est Orson.</i>
<i>Laisse-moi entrer.</i>
Nous devons parler.
<i>Je sais que tu m'entends.</i>
<i>Laisse-moi entrer.</i>
<i>Tu préfères que je réveille</i>
<i>tout le voisinage ?</i>
- Tom.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Ton portable est éteint.
Ryland veut nous voir.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Il y a eu un meurtre.
La police détient l'un des 4400.
C'est lui.
C'est Orson Bailey.
Bailey.
Un homme d'affaires, c'est bien ça ?
- Dans l'assurance vie ?
- Disparu dans les années 70.
En 1979. Déclaré mort en 1986.
La police de Seattle l'a arrêté
hier soir en rapport avec un homicide.
- Savent-ils que c'est l'un des 4400 ?
- Bailey leur a dit.
Je croyais qu'ils n'étaient pas censés
en discuter ?
C'est ce que le psy leur a dit,
mais on pensait plus
à leur entretien d'embauche.
En matière de meurtre,
il n'y a pas de protocole.
- Il est juste détenu, pas inculpé ?
- Exact.
Les dépositions sont contradictoires.
- On vérifiera.
- Discrètement.
- Je ne veux pas attirer l'attention.
- Nous serons discrets.
Diana.
<i>Bonjour, c'est Linda. Je ne suis pas là.</i>
<i>Merci de me laisser un message.</i>
Linda, c'est encore moi.
Tu voulais me parler,
alors réponds.
Linda, allez !
Très bien, rappelle-moi.
- Tout va bien ?
- Même scénario.
Il faudrait savoir ce qu'elle veut.
- J'ai eu un petit copain qui...
- Un petit copain ?
C'est si surprenant que ça ?
- Bref. Ce type...
- Arrête-toi là.
J'ai à peine commencé.
Je n'ai pas besoin d'être consolé.
Je pensais qu'une expérience commune
nous rapprocherait.
Tu peux ouvrir la porte ?
Combien de temps es-tu sortie
avec ce type ?
- Neuf mois.
- Neuf mois.
Tu compares tes neuf mois
avec mes 19 ans de mariage ?
Tu as raison. Laisse tomber.
Tu veux que je conduise ?
- Pourquoi ?
- Comme ça tu pourras ruminer.
Monte.
Regardez qui flottait
dans une boule de lumière.
- Tu te souviens de moi, Farrell ?
- Rossi. Salut.
Tes stéroïdes ont finalement fait effet.
Très drôle. J'ai toujours apprécié
ton sens de l'humour.
Comme le jour
où tu m'as vendu ces tickets.
Pour les Foo Fighters ?
Comment était le concert ?
Les flics m'attendaient à la porte.
Les tickets étaient volés.
On m'a arrêté.
- On t'a arrêté pour ça ?
- J'avais cinq pilules d'exta sur moi.
J'ai dû pisser dans un tube
pendant deux ans.
- Arrêtez.
- Lâche-le !
- C'est entre ton frère et moi.
- Ce sera bientôt entre toi et moi.
A plus tard, le monstre.
Au fait, sympa l'inscription sur ta voiture.
Ça va ?
Ça va.
On a tout sur vidéo.
Le type n'était pas content.
Mais il n'a jamais franchi le portail.
Kensington est tombé et s'est empalé.
- Vous avez vu toute la bande ?
- Oui.
- Bailey n'a pas passé la grille.
- Vous avez vu ça ?
- Du verre.
- Oui.
Il y a eu une explosion de l'intérieur.
On cherche une explication.
Aucune activité sismique, bombe
ou fuite de gaz n'ont été signalées.
- Et Bailey n'a rien dit ?
- Six personnes l'ont interrogé.
Rien de rien.
Vous m'avez déjà posé ces questions.
Nous sommes du ministère.
Dites aux guignols que je n'ai rien
à voir avec le meurtre d'Adam.
Résumons. Vous êtes allé voir Adam
pour un emploi.
Bien que cette société porte toujours
votre nom, il vous a rembarré.
- J'imagine ma réaction.
- Je l'admets. J'étais en colère.
Je suis allé chez lui pour...
Je ne sais pas bien pourquoi.
Mais je ne l'ai pas tué.
Nous avons l'e-mail que Kensington a
envoyé à son avocat après votre visite.
Ce n'est pas important.
"Bailey revendique sa participation
financière dans la société.
"Il veut intenter un procès. Réalise-t-il
que beaucoup de 4400 feront pareil ?
"Cela prendra des années.
Le pauvre bougre. C'est bien triste."
Je ne suis pas avocat,
mais je ne suis pas non plus idiot.
Ça fait douze heures
que je suis ici.
Soit vous m'inculpez...
soit vous me laissez partir.
- On va le laisser partir ?
- On dirait bien.
Le jour où je veux qu'on joue au bon
et au méchant flic, je te sonne.
- Et je jouerai lequel ?
- Je ne plaisante pas.
Il y a un temps pour allumer le type,
et ce n'était pas le bon.
Je suis désolée. Mais Bailey
a reconnu en avoir contre Kensington.
- Il est allé chez lui.
- Ai-je dit que l'affaire était classée ?
Vous croyez qu'ils pensaient à moi ?
Oh, ma chérie ! C'était tes parents !
Je suis sûre qu'ils pensaient à toi
tous les jours.
Merci de m'avoir amenée ici.
C'était si joli ici, avant. Maintenant,
les gosses laissent leurs détritus.
- Quel dommage.
- Ne t'inquiète pas.
- Crown Ridge est un bel endroit.
- Le cimetière ?
Oui.
- C'est là que tu seras.
- Que je serai quoi ?
Enterré.
Kensington a beaucoup de succès
aujourd'hui.
Tout le personnel a assisté
à son autopsie.
Pourquoi ?
Il était peut-être ennuyeux à mourir dans
la vie, mais dans la mort, c'est une star.
Regardez-moi ça.
Ce sont ses os pariétaux ?
Des morts par coups et blessures,
on en a vu.
Le type qui s'est jeté de la Space
Needle tenait dans un sac poubelle.
Mais je n'ai jamais vu un crâne
dans cet état auparavant.
- Des milliers de fragments d'os.
- Il s'est empalé.
- Il n'est pas mort de ça ?
- Ça l'aurait tué.
Mais c'est lorsque son crâne a explosé
qu'il est mort.
- Allô.
- Bonjour. Lily est là ?
- Qui ?
- <i>C'est Heidi ?</i>
Oui.
C'est Richard Tyler.
Je suis un ami de ta mère.
Ma mère s'appelle Carol.
Vous êtes sûr d'avoir le bon numéro ?
C'est bien la maison des Moore ?
Oui, mais il n'y a pas de Lily ici.
Désolée.
Je ne vais rien pouvoir
vous donner contre les nausées.
- Ah bon ? Pourquoi ?
- Ça ne marcherait pas.
Vous n'êtes pas malade, Lily,
mais enceinte.
C'est impossible. Les docteurs
me l'auraient dit en quarantaine.
La visite que vous avez passée
remonte à sept semaines.
Vous veniez peut-être de concevoir.
Concevoir ? Quand ?
Juste avant votre disparition, j'imagine.
Pas d'erreur possible,
vous êtes bien enceinte.
<i>Il n'y a pas d'inquiétude à avoir.</i>
<i>J'aimerais vous revoir quand</i>
<i>vous aurez assimilé la nouvelle.</i>
- Shawn.
- Salut.
- Comment vas-tu ?
- Bien.
- Tu as récupéré ta voiture ?
- Ça prendra encore une semaine.
Danny et moi allons à une fête
chez Evie Chobin, ce soir.
Viens avec nous.
- Je ne crois pas.
- Pourquoi pas ?
Ils vont écouter de la musique
que je ne connais pas,
parler de films que je n'ai jamais vus.
Le lycée me suffit,
alors faire la fête avec des jeunots...
C'est comme ça que tu me vois ?
- Tu avais 14 ans, Nikki.
- Et maintenant ?
Je suis en retard.
Où est ma femme ?
- Ma femme. Où est-elle ?
- Toutes nos condoléances.
- Nous vous avons appelé.
- Elizabeth ?
Embolie pulmonaire.
Nous avons essayé de la ranimer.
- Non !
- Essayez de vous calmer.
- Elle est morte ?
- M. Bailey !
- Je n'ai qu'elle au monde.
- Lâchez-moi.
- Lâchez-moi ! Arrêtez !
- Non !
Lâchez-moi !
Les points représentent les lieux
d'habitation d'origine des 4400.
- Tu veux dire "des enlevés".
- La presse les appelle "les 4400".
Reconnais qu'il est étrange
que ce soit un nombre rond.
Je me demande si ça a une signification.
Si 3 781 personnes étaient apparues
cette nuit-là, ça n'aurait pas été drôle ?
Cela aurait été moins bizarre.
Ce chiffre-là est carrément bizarre.
Et voilà où sont les 4400,
deux semaines après leur sortie.
- 65 % d'entre eux sont à Seattle.
- Ils ne rentrent pas chez eux.
- Et aucun d'eux ne sait pourquoi.
- On tient quelque chose ?
Au CDC, on appellerait ça
un foyer de maladies significatif.
Au FBI, on appellerait ça
une coïncidence.
Je ne crois pas aux coïncidences.
Aux foyers de maladies...
oui.
- Enceinte ?
- Je viens de l'apprendre.
Quand tu as disparu,
j'étais à New York depuis des semaines.
Je n'ai eu personne d'autre.
- Tu es l'Immaculée Conception ?
- J'ignore comment c'est arrivé.
Quand tu as disparu, j'aurais donné
n'importe quoi pour te reparler un jour.
Je parlais avec toi dans ma tête.
Tu m'as tellement manqué, Lil.
Mais ce n'est pas possible.
J'ai une autre famille, maintenant.
C'est injuste, mais...
Je fais partie de ta vie,
que tu le veuilles ou non.
Tu n'es plus dans ma vie depuis 11 ans.
Je veux voir Heidi.
- C'est impossible.
- C'est ma fille.
Elle l'ignore.
Elle pense que Carol est sa mère.
- Tu ne lui as jamais parlé de moi ?
- C'était un bébé.
- Tout comme nous.
- Tu ne peux pas m'empêcher de la voir.
C'est déjà fait.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Une ordonnance restrictive.
- Je n'ai rien fait de mal.
- Je suis avocat.
Je sais comment exploiter le système.
Je m'en servirai si tu m'y obliges.
- Ma priorité est de protéger ma famille.
- C'est moi, ta famille.
J'aurais bien aimé,
mais ce n'est plus le cas.
Je regrette, Lil. Je te demande
de ne pas t'approcher d'Heidi.
Ni de moi.
Désolé, Lily.
Au début, j'ai pris ça
pour un tremblement de terre.
Puis... je n'arrive pas à croire
que je vais dire ça...
Tout s'est mis à voler dans la pièce.
Le papier, les chaises.
- Que voulez-vous dire par "voler" ?
- Comme dans une tornade.
Sauf qu'il n'y avait pas de vent.
Tout le monde hurlait.
C'était comme si ma tête allait exploser.
Et puis ça s'est arrêté subitement.
- Et Bailey ?
- Il avait l'air effrayé, comme nous.
C'est là qu'il s'est enfui.
Le personnel...
Tout le monde dit qu'il fait partie
de ces gens, les 4400.
- Est-ce vrai ?
- Ecoutez-moi attentivement.
Que personne ne dise rien à la presse.
Le cas échéant,
nous nous intéresserons à cet endroit.
- Tous s'est mis à voler ?
- Tous les témoins l'ont confirmé.
Vais-je écrire ça dans mon rapport
au ministère de la Sécurité intérieure ?
Je dirais :
"Incident en cours d'enquête."
Bailey a quitté son hôtel.
Il est peut-être en cavale.
Trouvez-le. Les fuites à la presse
ne sauraient tarder
et je veux épingler Bailey
avant que ça n'arrive.
Le calcul est fidèle à tes souvenirs ?
Tu es au courant pour Williams
et Mlle Sinclair ?
- On les a surpris dans un placard.
- Quoi ?
- En train de se peloter, pas morts !
- De quoi ?
Tout le monde ne parle que de ça.
Alors, le monstre. Tu te caches encore
derrière ton petit frère ?
Tu sais quoi, Brad ?
Tu ferais mieux de t'écraser.
Et c'est toi qui vas m'y forcer ?
La seule chose que je vais écraser,
c'est toi, connard.
- Tu commences à m'énerver.
- Allez, vas-y.
Essaie toujours.
- Lâche-le !
- Shawn !
Qu'est-ce que tu lui as fait ?
- Je veux qu'elle parte.
- Doucement ! Elle va t'entendre.
En plus de me dire où je vais être
enterré, je reçois une brochure ?
C'est une coïncidence.
On s'attendait à autre chose.
Allons juste le lui expliquer.
Oui.
Maia...
Pas de problème. Je savais
que je ne resterais pas longtemps.
Allez, vas-y.
Passe-moi le ballon.
- A toi de lancer, homme de l'espace.
- C'est quoi, ton problème ?
- Mon problème ?
- Oui, ton problème.
- Qu'as-tu fait à Brad ?
- Tu ne vas pas t'y mettre. Arrête.
Tu as vu comment tu l'as fait tomber ?
Tu le sais, tout comme moi.
On l'a tous vu.
- Que veux-tu dire ?
- A toi d'expliquer.
Je ne lui ai rien fait, d'accord ?
Rien du tout.
Est-ce là tout ce qu'il reste ?
Pauvre Mme Bailey.
Une caisse de bibelots.
Ce sont des souvenirs.
Le genre de chose que tu lègues
à ta famille, à tes amis.
- Encore faudrait-il en avoir.
- Arrêtons là la discussion.
Il y en a qui sont
plus heureux célibataires.
Ceux qui croient ça
se fourrent le doigt dans l'oeil.
Je croyais que tu ne voulais pas
en parler.
Regarde ça.
Ça m'a tout l'air d'une piste.
"Résidence d'été des Wyler."
Le nom de jeune fille d'Elizabeth.
Orson panique, il doit se cacher.
- Il n'y a pas d'adresse.
- Il faudra la trouver.
C'est mieux comme ça.
Pour tout le monde.
Pour tout le monde ?
Ou pour toi ?
Maia, ma chérie. Ce n'est pas ta faute.
Tu es une petite fille merveilleuse.
C'est juste que... Kenneth et moi...
Nous avons fait une erreur.
Nous ne sommes pas prêts.
- C'est bon.
- Non.
Mais ma chérie, ces choses que tu dis...
Si tu ne fais pas attention, ça peut
effrayer les gens. Tu comprends ?
Bien.
Cadeau.
Allez. Prends-le.
- C'est quoi ?
- Un CD que j'ai gravé.
Un cours intensif
sur toutes les chansons cool du moment.
- Les groupes que tu ne connais pas.
- Merci.
Mais Nikki, j'aurai beau écouter
toutes les chansons du monde,
ils penseront toujours
que je suis différent.
Au moins tu écouteras
de la bonne musique.
Eclaire-moi. Tout le monde se comporte
comme si j'étais un monstre.
Mais toi... Tu n'as pas peur
qu'on te voie avec moi ?
Non. Je me fiche
de ce que ces abrutis pensent.
Si tu aimes le CD,
je t'en graverai un autre.
- D'accord.
- Très bien. Bon.
- A plus tard.
- A plus.
Montre-moi les photos satellites.
Nous cherchons donc une maisonnette
d'exposition nord
aux alentours du lac d'Appleton.
- Si elle est encore debout.
- Rien dans les sections 1, 2, 3 et 9
et celles des sections 4 et 7
ne correspondent pas.
- Ecarte-les.
- Restent les sections 5, 6 et 8.
Celle-ci est trop petite
et celle-ci n'a pas la bonne exposition.
Trop petite. Celle-ci est trop grande.
Elle n'existe plus.
Attends. Agrandis ici.
Ça pourrait bien être une maison.
Ces arbres doivent être gigantesques,
maintenant.
Agrandis encore.
- Bingo. Voilà la maison.
- Bingo.
Appleton est à quoi, 100 kilomètres ?
Oui. Et écoute bien :
quand on arrivera là-bas...
- Je me chargerai de Bailey.
- D'accord.
- On lui tombe dessus ?
- Pas de ça.
- Pas de problème.
- Vous êtes bien Tom Baldwin ?
Oui. Qui êtes-vous ?
Pour vous. Désolé.
On te poursuit en justice ?
Linda demande le divorce.
- Par ici.
- Tiens-toi prêt.
- Lily.
- Richard !
Richard !
Je ne comprends pas.
Je croyais que tu rentrais chez toi.
Oui, mais je n'avais aucune raison
de rester.
Comment as-tu fait pour me trouver ?
Woodland Park...
C'est bien là que tu emmenais Heidi ?
Richard, ça a été terrible.
<i>Brian est marié</i>
<i>et Heidi ne sait pas que j'existe.</i>
- Bonjour, Maia.
- Bonjour.
On est bien, ici.
J'étouffe dans mon bureau.
Vous ne m'avez pas amenée ici
pour me parler du temps.
- Tu es une petite fille très intelligente.
- Merci.
Le problème, c'est que les Griffin
n'ont pas dit pourquoi ils te ramenaient.
Il n'y a peut-être aucune raison.
Possible.
- Ont-ils été méchants avec toi ?
- Non.
- Alors, tu as été méchante ?
- Non.
Pourquoi t'ont-ils ramenée, alors ?
Ils n'aiment pas beaucoup les enfants.
Pourquoi dis-tu cela ?
Eh bien, ils m'ont ramenée
et je suis une enfant.
Tu ne veux pas vraiment
m'en parler, hein ?
Pas de problème.
Un jour, tu changeras peut-être d'avis.
Peut-être.
<i>Bonjour, c'est Linda. Je ne suis pas là.</i>
<i>Merci de me laisser un message.</i>
- Elle ne répond toujours pas ?
- Non.
- Je peux te poser une question ?
- Non.
Je vais quand même le faire.
Ton fils. Depuis combien de temps
est-il dans le coma ?
Trois ans.
- C'est long.
- Tu n'as pas idée.
Cela s'arrangera peut-être
entre ta femme et toi.
Un jour, Kyle se réveillera et je devrai
lui annoncer qu'on n'est plus ensemble.
Je vais à l'hôpital tous les jours. Ça me
donne l'impression d'être un bon père.
Tu es un bon père. Kyle a de la chance
d'avoir un père comme toi.
Ce n'est pas le cas de tout le monde.
Et crois-moi, j'en sais quelque chose.
Un bébé ?
Tu es sûre ?
J'ai fait trois tests.
Le problème, c'est que Brian
n'était pas là quand j'ai disparu
et je n'ai eu personne d'autre
depuis mon retour.
- C'est impossible. Comment peux-tu...
- Je l'ignore.
Désolée de vider mon sac sur toi,
c'est injuste.
C'est bon. Je...
Je veux t'aider.
Il y a quelque chose entre nous,
n'est-ce pas ?
- Je le sens.
- Je le sens, moi aussi.
C'est pour ça que je suis revenu.
Mais c'est plus compliqué que ça.
Ta grand-mère et moi...
Nous n'étions pas qu'amis.
Nous étions... plus que ça.
Nous allions former une famille.
Je le savais déjà, quelque part.
La façon dont tu parles d'elle.
L'expression dans ton regard.
Et moi qui croyais être impassible.
Une femme blanche et un homme noir
dans les années 50, ça devait être dur.
"Noir."
A l'époque, j'étais un "négro"
ou un "coloré", ou pire encore.
Mais ça nous était égal.
On se disait qu'après la guerre,
on irait dans une grande ville
comme Chicago, New York ou Paris.
- Mais tu n'es jamais rentré.
- Non.
Je ne suis jamais rentré.
Je suis contente que tu m'aies trouvée.
Moi aussi.
M. Bailey,
c'est Tom Baldwin du ministère.
On s'est rencontrés au poste de police.
<i>Nous voulons vous aider.</i>
<i>Vous devez nous parler.</i>
- Allez-vous-en.
- Impossible.
Je veux être seul.
Je ne veux faire de mal à personne.
Justement, on n'y tient pas non plus.
Partez, et vous n'entendrez plus jamais
parler de moi.
Je resterai ici, loin de tous.
Vous savez que c'est impossible.
Ouvrez la porte.
On peut trouver une solution.
Je suis de votre côté.
Non, c'est faux. Personne ne l'est.
Mon neveu est l'un des 4400,
tout comme vous.
Je sais combien c'est dur
pour vous.
Vous ne savez rien. Ma femme.
Elle était tout pour moi.
- Toutes mes condoléances.
- Gardez votre pitié.
Allez-vous-en.
Je veux qu'on me laisse tranquille.
- C'est impossible.
- Je le répète : laissez-moi tranquille.
N'approchez pas. S'il vous plaît.
Tom !
Ton nez !
Je ne contrôle rien.
Quoi que vous fassiez, arrêtez !
- Je ne contrôle rien !
- Arrêtez ! Maintenant.
- Tu vas bien ?
- Oui.
- J'appelle une ambulance.
- OK.
Nous appelons de l'aide, M. Bailey.
S'il vous plaît, ne mourez pas.
Il est toujours en vie,
mais il ne nous dira rien de sitôt.
Pour ce qui est du public,
nous nierons les faits.
Mais nous savons.
Cela va-t-il se reproduire ?
Suggères-tu de tous les remettre
en quarantaine ?
Tu as vu de quoi Bailey était capable.
Et tu l'as senti, tout comme moi.
Qui sait de quoi les autres
sont capables.
Moi, je n'en sais rien du tout.
Mais ce n'est pas mon boulot.
C'est le vôtre.
Content d'avoir repris du service ?
Merci de m'avoir sauvé la vie.
Je n'avais encore jamais tiré
sur personne.
- Le voir comme ça par terre...
- Ça ira ?
Oui. Tu sais, je pensais vraiment
ce que j'ai dit à Ryland.
Qui sait où tout cela va mener.
Nous n'avons qu'un cas.
Ce sera peut-être le seul.
Tu n'as rien remarqué d'inhabituel
chez Shawn ?
Je me demandais juste si tu me le dirais.
Rien de particulier.
Regarde ce type.
J'ai trouvé trois autres sites
comme celui-ci.
- Vous faites quoi ?
- De la recherche.
- Sur "4400 Scoop.com" ?
- C'est juste...
C'est ça, Internet.
Il y a des sites sur tout.
"La menace des 4400" ?
J'étais en quarantaine avec ce type.
Il aurait tué quelqu'un
juste par la pensée.
- Ça fait donc de moi un monstre ?
- Non, c'est juste que...
Comment as-tu mis Brad à terre
si rapidement ?
- Tu l'as vu aussi.
- Danny.
Tu ne sais absolument pas
de quoi tu parles.
Et toi non plus.
Shawn.
Quoi ? Tu pensais la même chose.
Traduction : Christelle Couvert
Dans l'épisode précédent...
Ecoutez-moi tous.
Etat d'alerte nucléaire maximal.
- La comète a changé de trajectoire.
- Ça n'arrive jamais.
- A croire que si.
- Ce n'est pas une comète.
<i>On dirait qu'il y a quelque chose,</i>
<i>là-bas.</i>
<i>La lumière a disparu et des milliers</i>
<i>de personnes viennent d'apparaître.</i>
Trouver Shawn et découvrir
ce qui lui est arrivé, c'est mon boulot.
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
Vous enquêterez
sur le retour des enlevés.
Et mes parents ?
<i>Ils sont morts, n'est-ce pas ?</i>
C'est Maia Rutledge.
Elle a 8 ans, sauf qu'elle est de 1938.
Le temps s'est arrêté.
Enlevé 2117 : Shawn Farrell.
- Oncle Tommy.
- Il est tout à toi.
- Et Kyle ?
- Kyle est dans le coma, Shawn.
On les laisse partir.
Ce serait illégal de les garder.
Shawn !
- Tu me reconnais ?
- Nikki ?
- Richard.
- Lily.
- Lily Bonham de St Louis ?
- Vous avez connu ma grand-mère ?
Certains n'ont nulle part où aller.
- Tu regardes quoi ?
- J'habitais là, avant.
Heidi ?
Heidi, c'est maman.
C'est bon, ma chérie.
- Brian.
- Lily.
Pas d'erreur possible,
vous êtes bien enceinte.
- C'est une ordonnance restrictive.
- Tu ne peux m'empêcher de la voir.
Qui sait où tout cela va mener.
Nous n'avons qu'un cas.
Ce sera peut-être le seul.
Tu n'as rien remarqué d'inhabituel
chez Shawn ?
Je me demandais juste
si tu me le dirais.
Qu'avez-vous de bon,
aujourd'hui, Carl ?
Il y a un poisson blanc
qui vous attend, Mme Martino.
Pendant les 18 mois de votre absence,
je n'ai jamais eu de bon poisson.
Mais vous...
vous savez me faire plaisir.
- Vous êtes si gentil.
- C'est facile de vous faire plaisir.
- Qu'est-ce que ça fait d'être de retour ?
- Ça va. C'est bien.
DISPARU LE 16 FEVRIER 2003
Carl.
J'ai l'impression
de n'être jamais parti.
Qu'est-ce que vous fabriquez ?
Je sers une cliente.
Rosie et Derek peuvent le faire.
Réapprovisionnez l'étal.
Mais je connais Mme Martino
depuis toujours.
Je m'en contrefiche.
Mettez ce flet sur la glace.
Grace.
- Bonne journée ?
- Longue, comme toujours.
C'est le quartier.
Rien n'est plus comme avant.
- Ça va encore.
- Ça a empiré pendant ton absence.
- Je ne trouve pas.
- Parce que tu refuses de le voir.
D'accord, c'est vrai. Ce n'est pas
comme quand on était petits.
Tout le monde s'en fiche.
Plus aucune fierté.
Plus aucun sens de la communauté.
J'ignorais que ça t'affectait à ce point.
Non, ça va.
Après tout, je t'ai récupéré.
Je n'ai aucune raison
de me plaindre.
Non.
Je suis désolé.
Je sens le poisson.
Ça ne me dérange pas.
Je prendrai une douche
en rentrant.
- Coupons par le parc.
- Tout le monde évite Bradley Park. Non.
Mais non.
A ton avis, par où suis-je passé ?
C'est dangereux.
C'est plein de voyous et de drogués.
Grace, c'est dans ce parc que je t'ai
demandée en mariage il y a 15 ans.
Oui, et je faisais du 36
et toi, tu avais les cheveux longs.
Les choses changent.
A partir de maintenant, tu feras le détour.
Grace, j'aimerais bien que tu...
arrêtes de t'en faire.
- <i>Acceptes-tu de m'épouser, Gracie ?</i>
- <i>Bien sûr que oui.</i>
Qu'est-ce que tu fous
dans notre parc ?
Votre parc ?
Ton portefeuille !
- Vous me rackettez ?
- T'as tout compris.
- Sept dollars ?
- Je n'ai que ça.
Il y a eu des plaintes quand sa famille
d'accueil l'a remise en quarantaine.
Quel genre de plaintes ?
Eh bien, par exemple, hier,
Maia parlait à une employée
de la cafétéria.
Elle lui a dit que sa fille irait à l'hôpital,
mais que tout irait bien.
Puis la fillette
a été victime d'un accident.
Vous voulez dire
qu'elle a le don de double vue ?
J'ai cinq incidents de ce genre.
Pourquoi retenir une fillette
pendant 60 ans
et la renvoyer
pour prédire l'avenir ?
Qu'avaient-ils derrière la tête ?
- On ignore s'il y a un "ils".
- Lui, elle, peu importe.
L'équipe de la salle des théories
verra ça.
On ne joue pas à des jeux vidéos.
C'est pour ça que tu les intimides.
Ils te sentent hostile.
Tant mieux.
Ne vous en faites pas trop
pour les intellos.
Allez plutôt voir la fillette.
Merci.
Je ne voulais pas leur faire peur.
On le sait, ma belle.
Mais pourquoi as-tu dit tout ça
à propos de la fille de Mme Krause ?
- Parce que c'est vrai.
- Mais comment le savais-tu ?
Je le sais, c'est tout.
Si je te demande s'il pleuvra
dimanche prochain, sauras-tu me dire ?
Peut-être.
Je ne sais pas.
Qu'est-ce que je vais devenir ?
Les médecins vont t'examiner
à nouveau.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Ça ne fera pas mal.
Je ne vous crois pas.
Ça va faire mal, pas vrai ?
Ce sera peut-être un peu désagréable,
mais ce sera surtout ennuyeux.
- Vous viendrez me voir parfois ?
- Moi ?
Pour voir si je vais bien.
D'accord.
- C'est cher.
- Avec l'allocation logement, ça ira.
Alors, avez-vous des questions ?
La petite chambre sera-t-elle
trop lumineuse pour un bébé ?
Elle donne au nord,
donc ça devrait aller.
Alors, qu'en penses-tu ?
- Il me plaît.
- A moi aussi.
- Est-ce votre premier bébé ?
- Nous ne sommes pas ensemble.
Ah, alors c'est pour vous et le bébé.
Non, pour nous trois.
Pourquoi pas ? Tu ne peux pas vivre
à l'hôtel. On partagera l'appartement.
A moins que tu n'en aies
pas envie.
Non. Non, j'en serais heureux.
Parfait.
Je vais remplir les papiers.
- J'espère ne pas t'avoir mis mal à l'aise.
- Non. C'est...
Ce n'est pas ça. J'ai pensé qu'avec moi,
il te refuserait l'appartement.
Je sais, je sais. On n'est plus en 1951.
Les choses ont changé, mais...
Je me dis parfois
qu'elles ont beaucoup changé.
Bon. Alors, c'est d'accord ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
Lily ? Lily, qu'y a-t-il ?
Lily ?
Je ne me sens pas très bien.
Assieds-toi.
J'appelle un médecin ?
- Non, partons d'ici.
- Pour aller où ?
N'importe où, mais pas ici.
Carl, où étais-tu passé ?
- Je me suis fait racketter.
- Oh, mon Dieu. Ça va ?
- T'ont-ils fait du mal ?
- Non, c'est plutôt le contraire.
- Comment ça ?
- J'ai appris quelque chose d'important.
Je suis différent. Ces extraterrestres
ont fait quelque chose.
Ils m'ont emporté. Ils m'ont changé.
En mieux.
Prends rendez-vous chez le psy
dès demain matin.
Je n'ai pas le temps.
J'ai des choses à faire.
- Comme quoi ?
- Le parc, Gracie !
Je veux qu'il soit comme avant.
Les gens y ramèneront leurs enfants.
On pourra aller pique-niquer
dans notre coin préféré.
Carl, tu me fais peur.
Tu n'as plus à avoir peur.
Linda, sais-tu pourquoi
le Dr Mayhew veut nous voir ?
Il n'a rien dit.
Alors, comment ça va ?
Bien.
Mon avocat m'a demandé
si tu avais signé les papiers du divorce.
On pourrait dîner ensemble un soir...
et les signer par la même occasion.
Comme ça tu pourrais annuler
à la dernière minute ?
J'apporterai les papiers, on prendra
un bon repas, un ou deux verres de vin...
Et on pleurnichera.
Oui, notamment.
Stefano's ?
Oui.
Je ne vois pas d'autre endroit.
Tom, Linda, merci d'être venus.
L'électro-encéphalogramme de Kyle
révèle une chose étrange.
Quoi encore ?
Kyle aurait eu une activité cérébrale
jeudi dernier.
De courte durée.
Quelques secondes.
C'est positif, non ?
En théorie, oui.
Ne nous réjouissons pas trop vite.
Je vais faire des examens
pour voir ce qui s'est passé.
Ça fait trois ans qu'on fait des examens.
Je sais que c'est frustrant,
mais il faut qu'on voie ça de près.
- Un coup ça va, un coup ça ne va pas.
- Ça n'en finit pas.
Linda.
On se voit chez Stefano's.
Jeudi, 19h30, ça te va ?
Parfait.
- Dorothy.
- Oui.
Kyle a-t-il eu de la visite, jeudi dernier,
à part sa mère et moi ?
Je vais vous dire ça.
Oui. Il a eu une autre visite.
Shawn, votre neveu.
Shawn !
Oui, je suis allé voir Kyle,
jeudi soir.
C'est mon cousin.
Je voulais le voir.
- Pourquoi ?
- Et il ne s'est rien passé ?
Je ne suis pas resté
plus de deux minutes.
Donc tu n'as rien vu
et n'as rien fait ?
Que voulais-tu que je fasse ?
Lors de ta soirée, un oiseau a heurté
la vitre, tu te souviens ?
Il s'est assommé.
Oui, et alors ?
Non, il s'est plus qu'assommé.
Ensuite... tu l'as ramassé.
Et soudain,
c'était comme si de rien n'était.
Qu'as-tu fait à Kyle ?
Je ne lui ai rien fait du tout !
J'aime bien discuter avec toi, oncle
Tommy, mais je dois aller en cours.
Shawn.
- On en reparlera plus tard.
- J'en suis ravi.
On va voir Fountains Of Wayne,
ce week-end.
Amusez-vous bien.
Arrête de jouer les solitaires,
c'est dépassé.
Moi, ça me convient très bien.
Fountains Of Wayne...
Vendredi soir !
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as ?
Lâche-le un peu.
Il faut bien le pousser.
Et ce n'est pas toi qui le feras.
Je le laisse tranquille.
Il a besoin de prendre ses repères.
Tu ferais bien d'en faire autant.
Marco.
Skouris. J'ai réfléchi à ton idée.
- Laquelle ?
- Alors, suis-je un génie ou suis-je folle ?
Pour nous, c'est pareil.
Je suis allé là où certains
avaient disparu sur la côte ouest.
Tu avais raison.
La pesanteur y est plus faible.
- Mais seulement de 5 milliardièmes.
- C'est à peine mesurable.
Et à peine compréhensible.
Pas de jargon, par pitié.
La pesanteur a changé
là où certaines personnes ont disparu.
Reste à savoir
si c'était naturel ou artificiel.
Et si c'était artificiel,
qui se cache derrière ça.
On en revient donc
aux extraterrestres ?
C'est possible.
Mais je dois prendre d'autres mesures.
En d'autres termes, on piétine.
Je te laisse le soin
de lui expliquer.
Attendez ! Vous vous souvenez
d'Adam Kensington ?
Le type des assurances
qu'Orson Bailey a tué.
Oui, et alors ?
Eh bien,
ce n'était pas un enfant de choeur.
Il faisait partie d'une combine
destinée à escroquer les clients.
Bailey a évité un rachat
d'1 milliard de dollars à Washington.
- Ça aurait été un deuxième Enron.
- Intéressant.
Ça ouvre toutes sortes de possibilités.
Bon... tenez-moi au courant.
Ceux qui l'ont renvoyé voulaient
qu'il règle le cas de Kensington ?
C'est une théorie.
Ça s'appelle la salle des théories.
Pas mal.
Mais non. Je suis nul.
Tu veux parler
de cette histoire de concert ?
Non, rien à voir avec ça.
Je veux juste savoir
ce qui se passe avec Nikki.
Comment ça ?
Je veux juste savoir
ce qu'il y a entre vous.
- Que crois-tu qu'il y ait ?
- Quelque chose.
Elle n'arrête pas de parler de toi.
Où qu'on aille,
elle veut que tu viennes.
- En quoi est-ce mon problème, Danny ?
- Sois gentil. Laisse-la tranquille.
C'est ce que je fais, non ?
Si tu as un problème avec elle,
c'est à elle qu'il faut en parler.
Ouais.
On a le même âge.
- Je ne suis plus ton petit frère.
- Tu te comportes comme un gamin.
Tu es mon frère. C'est ta copine.
Tout va pour le mieux... d'accord ?
Ouais.
Je suis ravie
d'avoir trouvé cet appartement.
Maintenant,
tu vas pouvoir avoir un ordinateur.
On verra plus tard.
Il faut que tu voies un médecin.
Je vais bien.
Je sais que ça va paraître bizarre,
mais l'autre appartement,
le bébé ne l'aimait pas.
Tu as déjà l'instinct maternel ?
Non. Je ne sais pas pourquoi,
mais je sais ce que pense le bébé.
Lily, tu n'es même pas encore enceinte
de deux mois. Le bébé ne pense pas.
Je ne le sais pas plus que tu ne sais
où tu étais ces 50 dernières années,
ou ce qui nous est arrivé
pendant notre absence.
Ça paraît bizarre, ce que je dis ?
Mais non.
Lily ?
Je berçais Heidi comme ça
quand elle était bébé.
- J'ai l'impression que c'était hier.
- Je sais.
Mais c'était il y a quoi... 11 ans ?
J'ai envie de voir Heidi.
Elle me manque.
Lily, attends un peu.
Quand Brian se sera fait à l'idée
de ton retour, il annulera l'ordonnance.
Arrête de bouger !
Arrêtez ! Arrêtez !
Ce n'est pas drôle !
Ferme-la ! Ferme-la, j'ai dit !
Hé, les gars, je vous suggère
de lui fiche la paix !
- Va te faire voir !
- Non !
Va te faire voir toi-même.
Vas-y, chope-le ! Allez !
Bonjour, Maia.
Ça fait longtemps
que tu es toute seule ?
Un petit moment. Je crois
qu'ils prennent leur pause-café.
Eh bien !
Ce n'est pas très malin
de leur part.
- Vous restez avec moi en attendant ?
- Evidemment.
Quand les médecins reviendront,
j'aurai à leur parler.
- Après, je pourrai rentrer à la maison ?
- A la maison ?
Avec vous.
Je n'aime pas être ici toute seule.
- Tu veux venir habiter chez moi ?
- Vous n'aimez pas être seule non plus.
Je pourrai revenir
pour me faire examiner. S'il vous plaît.
Maia, je ne suis même pas sûre
d'avoir envie de vivre avec moi-même.
Non, je... je mange de la pizza froide
au petit-déjeuner et...
Ça me va.
Ecoute, Maia.
Je vais y réfléchir, d'accord ?
- Où étais-tu passée ?
- Je suis passée voir Maia.
- Vraiment ?
- Je le lui avais promis.
- Alors ?
- Sid nous a envoyé ses travaux.
J'ai trouvé quelque chose d'intéressant.
Un type s'attaquant
à trois agresseurs, c'est possible.
Si vous l'aviez vu,
vous sauriez que non.
Il avait... 35, 40 ans,
environ 1 m 65, 75 kilos.
- Pas une armoire à glace.
- C'était sa façon de bouger.
Il avait peut-être pris de la drogue,
du PCP ?
Il ne se comportait pas
comme un drogué.
N'importe qui d'autre
aurait passé son chemin.
Ou... aurait appelé les flics après,
trop tard.
Mais... ce type m'a sauvée.
Excusez-moi.
Baldwin.
Linda.
Le restaurant. Oui, non... Linda, je suis...
Ne raccroche pas, Linda. Ecoute...
- Vous souvenez-vous d'autre chose ?
- Oui.
Ce type... Je ne veux pas critiquer,
mais... il sentait bizarre.
Le poisson pas frais.
Alors, c'était ta femme, au téléphone ?
- Je ne veux pas en parler.
- Très bien.
Y a-t-il un lien avec Orson Bailey ?
C'est possible.
Ce qui nous donnerait quoi ?
Un assureur aux pouvoirs télécinétiques,
une fille de 8 ans extralucide,
et à présent,
une sorte de super-défenseur.
- Beau trio.
- Les seuls pour lesquels on sait.
Vois-tu quelqu'un d'autre ?
Chaque cas en son temps.
Heidi, te souviens-tu
de la formule du triangle isocèle ?
Je ne suis peut-être pas
le meilleur, mais...
- Richard ?
- <i>Lily, enfin. Tu vas bien ?</i>
- <i>J'étais inquiet. Où es-tu ?</i>
- Je me suis fait arrêter.
Carl, mes petits-enfants
viennent dîner.
- Et si je leur faisais de l'espadon ?
- Excellente idée.
- Carl !
- Une seconde, Burt. Vous avez...
Je vous avais dit de ne pas bavarder
quand il y avait du travail.
- Arrêtez, avec votre doigt.
- Arrêter ?
Je vous ai demandé d'arrêter.
Lâchez-moi !
Je suis sérieux.
Je suis à l'heure. Je fais mon travail.
Alors, laissez-moi tranquille.
- Compris ?
- Compris.
Je disais donc...
combien vous en faut-il ?
Washington parle de remettre
les 4400 en quarantaine.
Pas que je sois d'accord.
S'ils sont dangereux,
les rassembler ne résoudra rien.
...alors j'ai pris mon revolver
et je l'ai abattue.
Qui ça ?
Tom, signe donc
les papiers du divorce.
Dennis, ne te mêle
donc pas de ça.
- Je lui ai parlé.
- Et depuis quand tu parles à Linda ?
J'ai dansé avec elle à votre mariage
et je ne suis pas censé lui parler ?
- J'étais en pleine enquête.
- Tom.
Tu l'as invitée à dîner
et tu lui as posé un lapin.
J'ai complètement oublié.
Peut-être.
Peut-être tout simplement
que tu ne veux pas voir la vérité en face.
- Brian Moore ?
- Oui.
- Je suis Richard Tyler, un ami de Lily.
- Encore un de ces 4400 ?
Cela vous pose-t-il problème ?
Je l'avais prévenue,
mais elle ne m'a pas écouté.
Je comprends, mais elle est en prison.
On ne peut pas la laisser comme ça.
Je veux seulement que ma fille,
que ma famille ait une vie normale.
- Ça ne se reproduira plus.
- Et je suis censé vous croire, c'est ça ?
Si vous retirez votre plainte,
elle n'embêtera plus jamais Heidi.
Vous l'aimiez, fut un temps, non ?
Oui, fut un temps.
- Je veux que tu arrêtes.
- Je ne peux pas !
Comment ça, tu ne peux pas ?
Ce que tu fais est dangereux.
Et en plus, c'est illégal.
Tu ne peux pas tabasser
les gens comme ça.
On m'a donné une chance
et je ne vais pas la laisser passer.
Je vais nettoyer ce parc et ensuite,
je nettoierai le quartier.
Mon Dieu, on dirait un fou.
Tu m'avais promis d'appeler ton psy.
- Non, c'est toi qui l'avais dit.
- Je l'appellerai demain.
Tu appellerais le ministère ?
Vu ton comportement,
que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Ce que je fais,
je le fais pour nous, Grace.
On habite ici. Je veux qu'on soit heureux
et qu'on arrête d'avoir peur,
peur de Bradley Park !
- Je ne veux pas que ça tourne mal.
- Tout ira bien.
Personne ne peut me faire de mal.
Tu n'es qu'un homme.
Je t'ai déjà perdu une fois.
Je ne veux pas te perdre à nouveau.
J'en suis capable.
Ce quartier redeviendra sûr.
Pour toi, pour Mme Martino...
et même pour Burt.
Alors s'il te plaît, arrête de t'inquiéter.
C'est ma mission.
Ma destinée.
Elle venait de sortir quand j'ai disparu.
Et c'est... Comment on appelle ça ?
Un bon vieux classique.
Un peu comme moi.
Mais non.
Il faut qu'on parle
de ce qui s'est passé hier soir.
Non, il n'y a rien à dire.
Tu sais ce que j'ai vu quand j'ai regardé
par la fenêtre de Brian ?
Une famille heureuse.
J'ai compris qu'Heidi
était bien sans moi.
- Peut-être qu'un jour...
- Je serai là si elle a besoin de moi.
Mais en attendant,
je garderai mes distances.
Je veux être auprès de toi,
maintenant.
Là où je suis heureuse.
Et le bébé est heureux, lui aussi.
Nous sommes donc trois
à être heureux.
Tout ce que tu as fait pour moi...
ce n'est pas parce que
je te fais penser à l'autre Lily ?
Au début, peut-être.
Mais maintenant, je ne vois que toi.
- Danny est à l'intérieur.
- Ce n'est pas lui que je suis venue voir.
Malin. Remets-la en route,
s'il te plaît.
Danny t'a-t-il dit quelque chose ?
C'est pour ça que tu es comme ça ?
Notre amitié ne le regarde pas.
Nikki, il n'y a pas d'amitié qui tienne,
d'accord ?
Shawn, écoute-moi...
Viens voir. Fais voir.
Fais voir.
Il n'y a plus rien.
Je n'ai plus mal.
Ce devait être
une brûlure superficielle.
Non, c'était plus que ça.
Tu as fait quelque chose,
pas vrai ?
ETAT CIVIL DU COMTE DE KING
COUR SUPREME DE WASHINGTON
Tom. Les super-défenseurs
ne courent pas les rues,
sauf dans les films avec Charles
Bronson, alors j'ai dû établir un profil.
On sait que c'est un homme blanc,
mince, qui a entre 30 et 50 ans.
C'est un ouvrier,
il a une mauvaise opinion de lui-même
et vit dans un quartier malfamé.
Jusque-là, ça va.
J'ai comparé mon profil
avec les 4400
de Seattle et des environs,
et j'ai trouvé 37 noms.
Tu ne vas pas tous les passer
en revue ?
J'ai réussi à en éliminer 24.
Je te passe les détails.
- Ça n'en laisse que 13.
- Le suspense est insoutenable.
Mes deux préférés :
Robert Lorenzano et Carl Morrissey.
Tous deux correspondent au profil,
mais Carl est notre homme.
Vise un peu son métier.
- Employé de supermarché.
- Oui. J'ai appelé le magasin.
Carl travaille au rayon poissonnerie.
- Et notre homme sentait le poisson.
- Eh oui. Je suis forte.
Hé ! Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Je viens de nettoyer !
Allez !
Nous voudrions parler à votre mari.
Pourquoi ?
- Où se trouvait-il mardi soir ?
- Il était ici.
- En êtes-vous sûre ?
- Puisque je vous le dis.
Avez-vous entendu parler
du "défenseur de Bradley Park" ?
Je ne vois pas le rapport avec Carl.
A vous de nous le dire,
Mme Morrissey.
Vous n'allez tout de même pas
le remettre en quarantaine ?
- Nous voulons l'aider.
- Comme c'est drôle.
Carl veut aider les gens,
lui aussi.
Les gens râlent,
mais personne ne fait rien,
personne n'essaie
d'arranger les choses, à part Carl.
Où est-il, Mme Morrissey ?
- Carl.
- Grace.
J'ai enlevé tous les graffitis.
Oh, mon Dieu. Carl.
Si tu avais vu ça.
Ils tombaient comme des quilles.
Je n'avais pas vu le couteau.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi.
- Ici l'agent Baldwin...
- Une ambulance, vite !
Envoyez une ambulance
à Bradley Park.
Je croyais pouvoir
nettoyer le quartier moi-même.
Que c'était pour ça qu'ils m'avaient
renvoyé, mais j'avais tort.
Non, ne me quitte pas, Carl.
Je t'en supplie.
Non !
Je te veux toi.
Je... te veux toi.
Non.
Pourquoi lui faire croire qu'il peut
faire la différence, le renvoyer...
Tout ça pour qu'il se fasse tuer.
- A quoi bon ?
- J'aimerais bien le savoir.
<i>La veuve du défenseur</i>

J'aime bien ętre l'adulte.
Je pense que tu vas bien t'amuser

On m'a dit

J'ai demandé ŕ M. Ryland la permission

Diana... Ce que tu vas lire

21 ANS APRES : LE RETOUR
DU TUEUR DE FRIDAY HARBOR
Oliver Knox a disparu
le 22 aoűt 1983,
cinq jours aprčs la découverte
du dernier cadavre.
- Quand est-il revenu ?
- Il y a trois semaines.
- 19 jours avant le tout dernier cadavre.
- Ça pourrait ętre une coďncidence.
La lettre semble authentique, mais
la victime n'était pas une prostituée.
- Les autres si.
- Une coďncidence.
On aime bien
ce genre d'attitude positive, ici.
Car si c'est Knox, il y a un tueur
en série parmi les 4400.
Ce n'est peut-ętre pas la pire
des hypothčses, mais c'est déjŕ bien.
Barbara Yates est trčs avide
de ce genre d'affaires.
- Alors, direction Friday Harbor.
- Rapportez-moi un t-shirt. Alex...
Service d'évaluation
de la menace intérieure, SEMI.
- C'est au sujet de Knox ?
- Oui.
C'est une petite ville.
Oliver réapparaît au bout de 21 ans,
il n'a pas pris une ride.
Nous avons fait le lien.
Allez-vous prendre le relais
pour l'enquęte ?
On coopérera jusqu'ŕ ce qu'on prouve
que Knox est coupable ou innocent.
Un peu d'air me fera du bien.
Et un peu d'aide aussi.
Son alibi est hermétique.
On veut quand męme lui parler.
Que pouvez-vous nous dire d'autre ?
Vous voulez
que je vous parle de Knox ?
A l'âge de 15 ans, lors d'une partie
de chasse ŕ l'arc avec son cousin,
Knox fut victime d'un accident
et reçut une flčche dans la poitrine.
Pris de panique,
son cousin a fui en courant.
Knox s'est réveillé dans une mare
de sang, une flčche dans la poitrine.
Alors il l'a retirée
et a cautérisé la plaie, c'est ça ?
Mieux que ça. Il s'est relevé
et a parcouru 12 km pour aller en ville.
Il s'est fait admettre aux urgences.
Et tout ça avec une flčche
dans la poitrine.
Plus tard, je lui ai demandé
si ça s'était passé ainsi.
Il a confirmé.
Je lui ai dit :
"Vous avez dű souffrir le martyre."
"Pas du tout", a-t-il répondu.
"C'était grisant."
Il aurait pu marcher comme ça
éternellement.
C'est lui.
DISPARU LE 22 AOUT 1983
M. Knox.
Nous avons des questions
au sujet de la mort de Theresa Baron.
Le shérif vous a appelés ou vous avez
tiré les męmes conclusions hâtives ?
Pas trčs hâtives. Vous avez été filmé
par une caméra de police en 83.
Avec plusieurs autres personnes.
Connaissiez-vous Mme Baron ?
Non. Elle est née
aprčs mon enlčvement.
Ecoutez, je sais que tout porte
ŕ croire que je l'ai tuée.
Je disparais en 83,
les meurtres cessent.
- Me revoilŕ, et la pauvre fille est tuée.
- Nous avons remarqué.
Si j'étais vous, j'aimerais aussi
que ce soit moi le coupable.
Ça serait bien pratique, mais...
Désolé de ne pouvoir
vous rendre service.
Je n'ai pas tué cette femme.
Voulez-vous un verre d'eau ?
Si on doit parler,
autant le faire de maničre civilisée.
Non. On vous a déjŕ
fait perdre assez de temps.
Conrad m'a dit qu'un jour vous aviez
reçu une flčche dans la poitrine.
Jim aime bien parler.
Vous voulez voir la flčche ?
Je l'ai encore.
Ce ne sera pas nécessaire.
Comment va Kyle ?
On ne sait pas encore.
A propos d'hier soir...
- Le baiser.
- Oui.
Entre autres.
- Il faut qu'on parle.
- Non.
Shawn.
Tu as un don.
- Nikki. Quand es-tu arrivée ?
- Comment va Kyle ?
Il est toujours en soins intensifs,
mais il est dans un état stable.
Je suppose que ce qu'ils lui ont fait
a marché.
Enfin pour l'instant.
Je meurs de faim.
Tu viens avec nous ŕ la cafétéria ?
Je te ramčne un burrito.
Commencez par quelque chose
de facile.
- Parlez-moi de vos parents.
- De mes parents ?
Ils se disputaient pour des questions
d'argent. Puis ils se sont séparés.
- Ils ont divorcé ?
- Oui, quand j'avais 14 ans.
Qu'avez-vous ressenti ?
J'étais déprimé.
En colčre, peut-ętre.
Parlez-moi des autres membres
de votre famille.
Ils sont morts.
J'ai des cousins en dehors de St Louis.
Pour eux, je ne suis...
qu'une photo dans un vieil album.
Mon mari s'est remarié.
Mon frčre n'est pas content
que je sois de retour.
A quoi tout cela sert-il ?
Ecoutez, vous voulez m'aider ?
Aidez-moi ŕ trouver du travail.
Dites-moi ce que je dois dire
quand on me demande mon âge.
Ou comment justifier le trou
dans mon CV.
On dit que c'est un monde meilleur,
qu'on n'est plus jugés sur sa couleur.
Mais on me juge encore.
Mes relations avec mes parents ?
Parlons de l'hostilité
que vous manifestez ŕ mon égard.
Danny, tu voulais me voir ?
Merci, Peter.
- Alors, c'est lŕ que tu travailles ?
- Oui.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- J'ai quelque chose ŕ te dire.
- A propos de Shawn ?
- Comment tu le sais ?
Vas-y, je t'écoute.
Il y a quelques semaines,
il s'est bagarré, au lycée.
Il aurait pu tuer l'autre,
mais je l'ai arręté.
Que lui a-t-il fait ?
Ça paraît fou, mais...
On aurait dit que Shawn drainait
la vie de son corps.
Je ne suis pas le seul ŕ l'avoir vu.
Pourquoi me dis-tu ça maintenant ?
Je pensais
qu'il fallait que tu le saches.
C'est magnifique.
Je me demande
si c'est lŕ qu'on était.
- Pourquoi tout le monde est-il ici ?
- Et toi ?
Je ne sais pas. Je voulais voir l'endroit
oů nous sommes revenus.
Je me suis dit que c'était l'endroit idéal
pour méditer, me changer les idées.
La plupart des gens viennent ici
pour parler.
- Il n'y en a pas beaucoup qui parlent.
- Pas pour l'instant.
Vers 23h00 se tient une sorte
de séance de thérapie de groupe.
Désolé de faire irruption,
mais je tenais ŕ venir voir ça.
Je m'appelle Jordan Collier.
DISPARU LE 10 AVRIL 2002
Vous me reconnaissez peut-ętre.
Si c'est le cas, vous savez que je suis
l'un des 4400, tout comme vous.
Vous vous ętes trouvés
les uns les autres. Je n'en reviens pas.
Et je suis ravi que vous vous souteniez
les uns les autres.
Et...
J'ai froid !
Et je suppose
que je ne suis pas le seul.
Je propose que ces réunions
se tiennent désormais ŕ l'intérieur.
Venez chez moi. Ce n'est pas loin.
Il y fait bon, il y a de la place.
Je vous invite tous ŕ m'y retrouver
jeudi prochain, dans l'aprčs-midi.
Vous écoutez les informations,
lisez le journal, entendez les rumeurs.
On dirait que le monde entier
se retourne contre nous.
Qu'allons-nous faire ?
Abandonner ?
Nous cacher ? Peut-ętre.
A moins que nous ne construisions
notre monde ŕ nous.
C'est ici qu'on a trouvé
le corps de Theresa Baron.
- On a passé les lieux au peigne fin.
- Oui, eh bien...
On a nos jouets.
On aime bien les sortir de leur boîte.
Le tueur l'a posée lŕ
aprčs l'avoir tuée ?
Il aurait dű y avoir
des traces de sang partout.
Il pleuvait, ce jour-lŕ.
La pluie a tout balayé.
Mais s'il l'a traînée jusqu'ici,
il a dű s'agripper ŕ quelque chose.
Tom.
Bon sang !
Son nom : Philip Lopez.
Emprisonné pendant 18 ans pour viol.
Il est en liberté conditionnelle
depuis 6 mois.
On a relevé ses empreintes
sur le lieu du crime de Theresa Baron.
Tout le monde est pręt ?
On y va.
Lopez !
Tom.
Il a laissé un mot.
Il aurait tué les 9 femmes.
Sa disparition
l'a empęché d'en tuer d'autres.
Les dates coďncident ?
Lopez était ouvrier saisonnier
lors de la premičre série de meurtres.
Nous devrions nous excuser
auprčs d'Oliver Knox.
S'il vous plaît ?
Un jus de canneberge Seltzer.
Et aussi...
la męme chose que lui.
- Comment ?
- Désolée, je...
Je pars ŕ Florence dans 4 jours. Je ne
veux pas passer pour une touriste.
- Des glaçons ?
- Oui.
- J'ai appris l'italien ŕ la fac.
- Vraiment ?
"Aussi belle
qu'un coucher de soleil sur le Duomo."
- Bravo. Vous méritez 20/20.
- Et vous une tournée gratuite.
- Felicia. Une bičre, s'il te plaît.
- <i>Grazie.</i>
Encore un verre, mon cher ?
- Merci.
- Ecoutez, je...
On ne se connaît pas,
mais j'ai quelque chose ŕ vous montrer.
- Comment s'appelle-t-elle ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Mais... je peux vous dire
quelque chose sur elle.
Coucou !
Désolée d'ętre en retard !
Bonjour, Iris,
comment s'est passée la journée ?
- Je ne peux pas revenir.
- Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
Cette enfant. Je suis désolée.
Vous trouverez bien
quelqu'un d'autre.
Je lui ai dit qu'on ne se verrait pas
pendant deux semaines.
Pourquoi lui as-tu dit ça ?
Parce qu'elle allait devoir
remplir la fonction de jurée.
Elle a cru que je plaisantais.
Quelques heures plus tard,
son mari l'a appelée.
Elle a reçu une convocation ?
Viens dans mes bras.
Ce n'est rien.
- Que fais-tu ici ŕ cette heure-ci ?
- Maman m'a dit que son état empirait.
Il a de nouveau
du liquide dans le crâne.
Pourquoi m'ont-ils emporté
et l'ont-ils laissé comme ça ?
On était tous les deux sur la plage,
ce soir-lŕ. Je ne comprends pas.
Si seulement je me rappelais
ce qui s'est passé.
Ça ferait avancer les choses.
Tom m'a dit que tu étais lŕ
le soir oů Kyle a eu...
Oů une activité cérébrale
a été enregistrée.
Il allait mieux.
Et maintenant,
il est en train de mourir.
Shawn, lui as-tu fait quelque chose ?
Shawn, dis-le-moi.
Dis-moi quelque chose.
Tu sais bien que je n'ai rien fait.
Je l'ai dit ŕ oncle Tommy.
Je te le dis aussi, d'accord ?
Il faut que j'y aille.
Si seulement on pouvait en parler
ŕ un médecin.
Et lui dire quoi ?
"Mon bébé est un extraterrestre,
et, au fait, je sais ce qu'il pense" ?
Avec ça, s'ils ne me renvoient pas
en quarantaine...
J'ai déclaré
notre changement d'adresse.
Merci, je n'ai pas envie
de retourner lŕ-bas.
Je suis tombé sur Gary Branscombe.
Il était dans le lit d'ŕ côté. Il m'a parlé
des réunions de Jordan Collier.
- Le type qui tient un hôtel ?
- Oui. Il serait l'un des nôtres.
On devrait y aller.
Voyons, Richard ! Les adolescents
faisaient ça aussi en 1951.
- Oui, dans une voiture prčs d'un lac.
- Dans une voiture prčs d'un lac ?
Comme c'est mignon.
<i>Je vais vous dire quelque chose</i>
<i>sur elle...</i>
<i>Je vais vous dire quelque chose...</i>
<i>Je peux vous dire quelque chose...</i>
<i>Je vais vous dire quelque chose...</i>
<i>Je vais vous dire quelque chose...</i>
Vous ętes malade ?
Dégagez !
Je les ai tuées.
Je les ai toutes tuées.
- Je les ai toutes tuées.
- Haut les mains ! Pas un geste !
Gail Keating.
Elle travaillait dans un vidéoclub.
Son corps a été retrouvé
dans le parc ce matin.
Il était couvert de sang.
Il a parlé pendant cinq minutes
quand on l'a amené.
Il a avoué le meurtre de Gail
et celui des neuf autres filles.
- Depuis, pas un mot.
- C'est Lopez qui a tué Theresa Baron.
Il l'a écrit avant de se suicider.
La chemise de Theresa était chez lui...
Ce matin, Charlie Staley a avoué
avoir commis ce meurtre-lŕ.
Ils ont déclaré ętre coupables
de la 1re série de meurtres ?
Oui. Mais Charlie a 39 ans. Il en avait 5
quand le premier meurtre a eu lieu.
On peut aussi éliminer Lopez
de la liste des suspects.
- Pourquoi ça ?
- Les registres de la prison.
Lopez était gaucher.
D'aprčs l'autopsie,
le tueur de Friday Harbor
était droitier.
Donc, Lopez tue une fille,
Staley tue l'autre,
mais aucun des deux
n'a commis la 1re série de meurtres.
Pourquoi avouer des meurtres
qu'ils n'auraient pas pu commettre ?
- Il y a quelque chose qui cloche.
- Sauf si on fait le lien avec Knox.
Il disparaît : plus de meurtres.
Il revient : ça recommence.
Knox est impliqué
d'une façon ou d'une autre.
Il obligerait ces hommes
ŕ commettre les meurtres pour lui ?
Peut-ętre.
Mais dans ce cas, comment ?
Pourquoi faire avouer les meurtres
ŕ 2 personnes ?
Une personne : on arręte de chercher.
Deux : ça attire notre attention.
Il ne contrôle peut-ętre pas tout. Et si
Knox pouvait obliger les gens ŕ tuer ?
En les convainquant
qu'ils sont le tueur de Friday Harbor ?
S'ils commettent un meurtre,
ils les commettent tous.
Bonjour, bienvenue.
1969 ? L'avantage, c'est que les pattes
d'éléphant sont revenues ŕ la mode.
- Bonjour.
- Enchantée.
Je viens de parler ŕ un type
disparu il y a 40 ans.
Quand il est revenu,
la vie a repris son cours.
Moi, j'ai disparu
il y a trois ans seulement.
- Et tout s'écroule autour de moi...
- Je sais, Shawn.
Nous ressentons tous
la męme chose, tu sais.
Nous ne sommes pas tous pareils,
si vous voyez ce que je veux dire.
Je n'en suis pas sűr.
Bon. Je me suis battu au lycée,
et je sais que ça va paraître dingue...
Je ne peux pas en savoir
davantage.
Pas maintenant. J'ai beaucoup
d'interviews dans les semaines ŕ venir.
Il y a des choses
que je dois ętre en mesure de nier.
Je sais que tu es un peu perdu,
c'est tout ŕ fait normal.
Mais j'ai l'impression
que tu as reçu un don.
C'est ce que Nikki a dit.
Eh bien, cette fameuse Nikki
a raison.
Ne te laisse pas impressionner
par ce don.
- Tu sauras comment l'utiliser.
- Bon.
Que puis-je faire pour vous,
Lily 93 ?
Ne vous en faites pas,
je ne vous drague pas.
Męme si vous ętes la plus jolie enlevée
que j'aie rencontrée cet aprčs-midi.
- Jordan Collier. J'organise la réception.
- Oh, enchantée.
- Tiens.
- Merci.
Serait-ce le début d'une idylle
entre deux 4400 ?
Vous ętes observateur.
Je suis ravi qu'il en ressorte
quelque chose de positif.
- Vous ętes Jordan Collier.
- Oui. Vous voyez ? Il ne me craint pas.
J'ai la tęte qui tourne.
Il fait chaud.
Je ferais bien de m'asseoir.
- Je vais vous trouver un sičge.
- Je vais te chercher de l'eau.
Merci.
Merci.
Vous voulez que j'appelle un médecin ?
Non, je ne suis pas malade.
Ça va passer.
- Tiens.
- Tant mieux.
- Si vous n'ętes pas malade, alors que...
- Ce sont les nausées du matin.
- Vous ętes enceinte.
- En début de grossesse.
Tout s'explique.
Félicitations ŕ tous les deux.
J'ai dit quelque chose
qu'il ne fallait pas ?
- C'est un peu compliqué...
- Richard n'est pas le pčre.
Je n'étais pas enceinte quand on m'a
enlevée, mais je l'étais ŕ mon retour.
Bizarre, non ?
Intéressant, je dirais.
C'est ŕ se demander
ce qu'ils avaient en tęte.
Ceux qui nous ont enlevés,
je veux dire.
Vous n'en avez pas parlé
ŕ votre psychologue, j'espčre ?
- On n'en a parlé ŕ personne.
- C'est plus sage pour l'instant.
Est-ce que tout va bien pour vous ?
Vous n'avez besoin de rien ?
Non, si ce n'est d'un travail.
J'étais pilote dans l'armée de l'air.
Je devais toucher ma retraite.
Pour l'instant, je n'ai rien reçu.
J'ai posé ma candidature pour ętre
pilote, męme pour la police de Seattle.
Dčs qu'ils apprennent
que je suis l'un des 4400,
le poste me passe sous le nez.
Ecoutez. J'ai quelque chose
ŕ vous proposer.
Rien ŕ voir avec l'aviation, mais vu que
vous avez travaillé pour l'armée...
Il y a un poste dans le département
de la sécurité de ma fondation.
- Votre fondation ?
- Pour les 4400.
Si ça vous intéresse,
venez me voir demain.
- J'en serai ravi.
- Trčs bien.
<i>La vague de violence</i>
<i>liée aux 4400 continue.</i>
<i>Le ministčre de la Sécurité</i>
<i>enquęte sur la possibilité d'un lien</i>
<i>entre les meurtres de Friday Harbor</i>
<i>et un enlevé encore inconnu.</i>
C'est une hypocrite, une irresponsable,
et en plus, elle est contente d'elle...
- Il n'aime pas son émission.
- C'est elle qu'il n'aime pas.
Quand on travaillait pour le FBI,
elle avait révélé le nom d'un juré.
Le procčs fut ajourné.
Trois ans de travail pour rien.
Un jour, elle m'a fait un sale coup.
Pas question que ça se reproduise.
Tom Baldwin.
Oui, shérif.
Je vois.
On arrive. C'était Conrad.
Il a encore reçu une lettre.
"C'est moi qui décide du sort de chacun.
"Mon jugement est définitif.
Je rendrai d'autres verdicts."
La date provient
du journal de ce matin.
Charlie Staley n'a pas pu faire ça.
Pas de prison.
Le tueur de Friday Harbor
a envoyé cette lettre ?
Elle est authentique. Elle décrit
les blessures des 1res victimes.
Ces informations étaient secrčtes.
Si vous croyez Knox coupable,
pourquoi court-il toujours ?
- Allons le cueillir.
- Impossible.
Il nous faut d'abord établir un lien
entre lui et les meurtres.
Alors on fait quoi ? On attend
qu'une autre fille se fasse tuer ?
On peut faire mieux que ça.
- Votre monnaie : 27,75 dollars.
- Merci.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Je vais vous dire quelque chose.
Elle s'appelle Felicia.
Elle travaille au bar...
Je m'attendais ŕ une réprimande
par téléphone.
Ou ŕ un audit fiscal. Mais pas ŕ ętre
invitée dans le ventre de la bęte.
C'est comme ça quand une personne
en vue sčme le trouble.
- C'est flatteur.
- Non, pas vraiment.
Washington vous a dans le collimateur.
Laissez tomber l'affaire des 4400.
Pas question.
Je suis journaliste, j'obéis au public.
Ne vous cachez pas derričre la liberté
de la presse. Vous semez la panique.
Et vous allez arręter
avant que les choses ne s'enveniment.
Oui, votre visage respire la force.
Vous devriez venir dans mon émission.
Vous m'empęchez
de faire mon travail.
Si vous continuez ŕ marcher sur
les platebandes du ministčre, attention.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Me faire disparaître ?
- Je vous ai demandé de coopérer.
- J'ai choisi de refuser.
Trčs bien. N'oubliez pas de faire
valider votre ticket de stationnement.
La couverture sociale est incroyable.
Toutes vos visites
chez le médecin et ŕ l'hôpital
seront prises en charge
aprčs la naissance du bébé.
- M. Collier, je ne sais pas quoi dire.
- Dites que vous acceptez le poste !
Excusez-moi, je dois répondre...
Len ?
Bien.
Toute la propriété ?
Parfait. 26 millions.
Oui, clôture l'affaire.
Ne t'en fais pas
pour le conseil d'administration.
Ils m'ont réélu Directeur général
ŕ mon retour. J'en fais mon affaire.
Appelle-moi quand ce sera fait.
D'accord.
Ah, les transactions immobiličres !
Elles n'en finissent pas.
Alors, allez-vous travailler pour moi ?
Je peux commencer demain.
M. Ryland, Phil Gibson.
Enchanté.
Barbara sera déçue
de ne pas pouvoir ętre lŕ.
- A vrai dire, je préfčre vous parler.
- Trčs bien.
Sachez que quoi que
vous nous disiez sur les 4400,
on ne remontera pas
jusqu'ŕ vous.
J'en suis ravi. J'ai quelque chose
d'important ŕ vous dire.
- Puis-je enregistrer ?
- Je serai bref et précis.
Je veux que Barbara Yates
arręte ses reportages sur les 4400.
- Comment ça ?
- Qu'elle abandonne.
Plus de reportages sur cette affaire,
point final.
M. Ryland, c'est Barbara elle seule
qui décide du contenu des reportages.
Barbara dit ce qu'elle veut.
Je n'ai pas mon mot ŕ dire.
Vous ętes son producteur.
Alors produisez.
Savez-vous comment
on travaille, aujourd'hui ?
- Je ne suis pas Walter Cronkite.
- Vous voulez parler du passé ?
Autrefois, il m'aurait fallu un mandat
pour mettre votre téléphone sur écoute,
bloquer tous vos capitaux,
et vous empęcher de voyager par avion,
quelle que soit la compagnie aérienne.
Comme vous dites,
ce n'est plus comme avant.
Vous avez toujours travaillé
avec Barbara Yates.
Vous devez savoir
oů les corps sont enterrés.
Faites-moi un plan.
Mon pčre t'engueulera
si je sens la bičre en rentrant.
L'affreux cousin Shawn
qui corrompt les innocents.
Au secours !
Aide-moi, Shawn !
Oh, mon Dieu !
Excusez-moi.
J'ai perdu mon chien.
Aidez-moi ŕ le retrouver.
- Je ne l'ai pas vu.
- Un terrier blanc. Il s'appelle Boss.
Je ne l'ai pas vu.
Laissez-moi passer.
Ça ne m'amuse pas.
- Je vais crier.
- Oh, ça oui.
Pas un geste !
Felicia doit mourir !
Il le faut !
Cet homme.
Que vous a-t-il dit, M. Mitchell ?
- Vous m'avez suivi ?
- Non. C'est Knox que nous suivions.
J'aime la composition de cette photo.
Belle symétrie.
Alors, que vous a-t-il dit ?
Continue avec lui. On va faire
asseoir Knox ŕ côté de son ami.
On va voir
ce qu'ils ont ŕ se dire.
- Knox ! Ouvrez !
- Tom !
Knox !
- La police est-elle chez la fille ?
- Elle a refusé de se faire escorter.
FELICIA DOIT MOURIR
Allô.
Allô ?
Excusez-moi.
J'ai perdu mon chien.
Aidez-moi ŕ le retrouver.
Un terrier blanc. Il s'appelle Boss.
Au secours ! A l'aide !
Lâchez-la, Knox !
Knox ! Lâchez-la ou je tire.
- Vous m'avez cassé le nez.
- Ne bougez pas !
- Vous faites erreur. Je vais vous dire...
- Silence.
Foutu tueur en série. Il assassine
huit personnes avant d'ętre enlevé.
Ils le renvoient, et il remet ça.
En 83, Knox était
le psychopathe moyen.
Ils l'ont renvoyé plus puissant.
C'est différent.
Ceux qui l'ont enlevé
sont sournois.
Ils ont aussi renvoyé Shawn.
Et Maia.
Je sais. Et j'aimerais les en remercier.
Mais tout ça semble aléatoire.
Peut-ętre. Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'on mette
tous les éléments bout ŕ bout.
Orson Bailey tue Adam Kensington.
Vengeance. Ça crčve les yeux.
Carl Morrissey est un défenseur
bien intentionné. Il meurt.
C'est aléatoire.
Mais on sait que Kensington
était impliqué dans une fraude.
On sait ŕ présent
que depuis la mort de Morrissey,
ses voisins ont créé
un comité de protection du parc.
Ne voyez-vous pas
un certain schéma ?
Quoi ? Tu veux dire
qu'il y a comme un effet de cascade ?
Diana, premičre de la classe.
Les incidents sont les catalyseurs
des changements.
- Qui sont positifs dans ces 2 cas.
- Une petite minute.
Ceux qui les ont renvoyés
auraient prévu ces changements ?
Les meurtres de Knox
n'ont rien de positif.
Les conséquences ne sont
peut-ętre pas encore visibles.
S'il vous plaît !
Hé... J'ai quelque chose ŕ vous dire.
Hé...
J'ai quelque chose ŕ vous dire !
<i>La police refuse de dire</i>

Que fais-tu ici, Shawn ?
Kyle ?
Combien de temps...
ai-je passé dans l'obscurité ?
Traduction : Mireille Sirvain
Dans les épisodes précédents...
Nous ne sommes pas sûrs.
On distingue quelque chose.
La boule a disparu. Des milliers
de personnes viennent d'apparaître.
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
Vous enquêterez
sur le retour des enlevés.
- On les laisse partir.
- On les laisse partir ?
Ce serait illégal de les garder.
Pourquoi retenir une fillette
pendant 60 ans
et la renvoyer
pour prédire l'avenir ?
- Qu'avaient-ils derrière la tête ?
- S'il y a un "ils".
Ceux qui les ont renvoyés
auraient prévu ces changements ?
Tu veux dire
qu'il y a comme un effet de cascade ?
Je n'étais pas enceinte quand on m'a
enlevée, mais je l'étais à mon retour.
Vous n'en avez pas parlé
à votre psychologue, j'espère ?
Il y a un poste dans le département
de la sécurité de ma fondation.
- Si ça vous intéresse, venez demain.
- J'en serai ravi.
<i>Malgré les protestations, le ministère</i>
<i>refuse de divulguer les noms</i>
<i>et l'endroit où se trouvent</i>
<i>les 4400 vivant aux Etats-Unis.</i>
Vous m'empêchez
de faire mon travail.
Et qu'allez-vous faire ?
Me faire disparaître ?
- A propos d'hier soir...
- Le baiser.
Entre autres.
Il faut qu'on parle.
L'électro-encéphalogramme de Kyle
révèle une chose étrange.
Kyle aurait eu jeudi dernier
une activité cérébrale de courte durée.
Shawn, lui as-tu fait quelque chose ?
Dis-le-moi.
- Depuis quand suis-je dans l'obscurité ?
- Kyle ?
Ses résultats ne révèlent rien.
Il doit nous manquer des éléments.
On ne se réveille pas
d'un coma de trois ans sans raison.
Ça nous est égal. Pas vrai, Tom ?
Tout ce qui compte,
c'est qu'il soit réveillé.
Ça fait une semaine qu'il subit des tests.
On peut le ramener à la maison ?
- <i>Il n'a plus aucune raison de rester ici.</i>
- <i>C'est formidable.</i>
<i>Mais il y a autre chose.</i>
<i>Les patients comme Kyle ont souvent</i>
<i>des problèmes de réinsertion.</i>
<i>Ils réagissent mieux</i>
<i>dans un environnement familier.</i>
<i>Que ce soit par rapport</i>
<i>aux lieux, aux gens...</i>
Allez, on y va.
- Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ici ?
- Tu seras mieux à la maison.
- Alors qu'est-ce qu'on fait ici ?
- Kyle, c'est chez toi ici.
C'est ta chambre, Kyle.
Exactement comme tu l'avais laissée.
Tout va bien.
Je suis là.
Je suis là.
Ce n'est pas ma chambre.
Et ce n'est pas chez moi ici.
Kyle.
Qu'est-ce que tu cherches, fiston ?
Dis-moi ce que tu cherches.
- On peut t'aider.
- Kyle, dis-nous ce qu'il y a.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
- Laissons-le retrouver ses repères.
Mais il ne reconnaît même pas
sa chambre.
Linda, le docteur a dit
qu'il serait désorienté.
Je suis contente
que tu reviennes vivre ici.
J'essaierai de te déranger
le moins possible.
<i>Vous ne croyez pas</i>
<i>que vous exagérez, Jordan ?</i>
<i>Non, pas du tout.</i>
<i>Publier les noms et adresses</i>
<i>des 4400 constitue un délit, Barbara.</i>
<i>Il s'agit d'une violation de la vie privée</i>
<i>de plus de 4000 personnes.</i>
<i>L'instigateur devrait être</i>
<i>poursuivi en justice.</i>
<i>Donc avertir le public</i>
<i>qu'ils pourraient vivre à proximité</i>
<i>d'une menace publique est un délit...</i>
- On n'en veut pas.
- <i>Shawn, c'est ton oncle.</i>
<i>Ouvre-moi.</i>
- Oncle Tommy.
- Salut, Shawn.
- C'est pour une visite guidée ?
- C'est le défilé dans la rue.
Ils ont commencé à se pointer le jour
où mon nom est apparu sur Internet.
Et depuis ça n'arrête pas.
Ce n'est pas génial ?
Je sais que c'est dur pour toi, Shawn.
Je suis juste passé te dire merci.
On a ramené Kyle à la maison hier
et... je t'en suis reconnaissant.
- Il va bien, hein ?
- Il a beaucoup de progrès à faire mais...
il est réveillé.
Tante Linda est au courant ?
- Elle sait ce que j'ai fait ?
- J'ai pensé que tu ne préférerais pas.
Pour être honnête, oncle Tommy...
Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé.
J'ai juste posé mes mains sur lui,
et il s'est réveillé.
- Je ne sais pas pourquoi il s'est réveillé.
- Tu sais, Shawn.
Ce truc que tu peux faire,
il faut qu'on en apprenne davantage.
Comment ?
Il faudrait que j'aille en quarantaine,
pour qu'ils m'examinent.
Non ! J'en ai assez de tout ça.
De l'hypnose, des carnets de rêves
et de la psychothérapie.
Je comprends parfaitement,
mais je peux peut-être t'aider.
Je ne crois pas, oncle Tommy.
Quel film !
Le plus grand écran que j'aie jamais vu.
Et le son et tous ces...
- Effets spéciaux.
- Oui.
- Alors ça t'a plu ?
- Pas trop. Mais c'était beau à voir.
- Quelque chose ne va pas.
- Couche-toi !
- Le génie est sorti de sa bouteille.
- Trois bombes différentes en un jour.
Chacune ayant pour cible les 4400 dont
les adresses ont été rendues publiques.
Attends un peu.
- C'est une bombe détonnée par un fil.
- Un engin très rudimentaire.
Un amateur.
Diana, je viens de trouver
un morceau du tuyau.
Bien joué.
Shawn est sur la liste.
Ma soeur a renforcé
son système de sécurité, mais...
Je m'inquiète aussi pour Maia.
Tu as pensé à la remettre
en quarantaine ?
Oui, j'y ai pensé.
Nous en avons même discuté.
Elle s'est mise à pleurer.
Elle veut rester avec moi, Tom.
Je suis content que ça se passe bien.
Qui l'aurait cru ?
Et comment va Kyle
depuis qu'il est rentré ?
Il est encore faible,
mais au moins il n'est plus à l'hôpital.
Qu'en pense son docteur ?
Il est stupéfait, tout comme nous.
C'est un miracle.
Je ne trouve pas d'autre mot.
Et Shawn ?
Que veux-tu savoir ?
Où était-il quand Kyle s'est réveillé ?
Je n'en ai aucune idée.
La conception et la composition
des trois bombes étaient identiques.
Toutes détonnées par des fils.
J'ai fait une analyse de l'explosif.
Il est de type artisanal,
à base de détergent.
On trouve les instructions sur Internet.
Comme la liste des victimes.
J'aimerais savoir
qui a divulgué les noms.
Allons, qui a vendu la mèche,
d'après vous ?
- Barbara Yates.
- C'est son style tout craché.
Minable, inflammable,
irresponsable et dangereux.
Je m'occupe de Yates.
Retrouvez les visiteurs des sites
qui ont publié ces instructions.
- On aura bientôt les résultats.
- Moi aussi.
- Tout le complexe est à vous ?
- 80 maisons.
Une fois qu'il sera terminé,
je prévois des développements
à Chicago et Los Angeles.
J'ai l'intention d'offrir un havre de paix
aux 4400 qui en ont besoin.
On ouvre plus tôt que prévu
à cause des attentats.
Vous voyez grand.
Je suis un homme d'affaires.
J'ai enfin l'occasion
de faire autre chose dans la vie
que m'enrichir.
Car en ce moment, ça ne me suffit plus.
C'est peut-être
la crise de la quarantaine.
93 Tomberra Lane,
qu'est-ce que vous en dites ?
Elles sont belles.
Elles sont toutes belles.
Elle est à vous. Vous allez être
nos premiers résidents officiels.
Nous n'avons pas les moyens
d'acheter une maison.
Considérez ça comme un cadeau
pour vous deux et votre bébé.
Le monde est petit.
C'est grâce à toi, hein ?
Que Kyle s'est réveillé ?
C'était toi.
Tu l'as guéri, de la même manière
que tu as guéri ma main.
- Tu en as parlé à Danny ?
- Non, et ne lui dis rien.
Mais peut-être que s'il savait
ce que tu as fait,
il arrêterait de te voir comme...
Un monstre.
J'ai beaucoup réfléchi.
A ma relation avec Danny.
- Je pense que c'était une erreur.
- Je ne veux rien savoir.
Ce n'est pas ta faute.
Tu peux me croire.
Danny est un chic type.
Je l'aime bien, mais...
rien de plus.
Toi par contre,
tu lui plais beaucoup.
Je sais.
- Dennis Ryland ?
- Oui.
Je m'appelle Warren Lyttel. Le ministère
vous a averti de mon arrivée.
Oui, ils m'ont prévenu.
Eh bien, ils ne sont jamais contents.
Ils trouvent que votre enquête
sur les 4400 n'avance pas assez vite.
Je suis ici
pour vous donner un coup de pouce.
"Autorisation de consulter
les dossiers des 4400.
"Accès aux réunions et aux briefings.
"Permission d'accompagner
les agents de terrain."
- Vous avez un mandat étendu.
- Vous avez cinq meurtres sur les bras.
Trois attentats non résolus.
Barbara Yates
qui nous malmène sur les ondes.
Il leur semble
que vous avez besoin d'aide.
Pas étonnant que des bureaucrates
voient les choses ainsi.
Tout le monde les voit ainsi,
sauf vous dans votre tour de verre.
J'ai 1 000 enlevés dans un rayon
de 100 km autour de Seattle.
Et j'ai une vingtaine d'agents
pour les surveiller.
Vous voulez m'aider ?
Engagez-moi du personnel.
Vous voulez m'aider ? Dites
à Washington de me laisser tranquille.
Mais vous n'êtes pas vraiment ici
pour m'aider, je me trompe ?
Non.
- On est là pour recoller les pots cassés.
- Où vous ont-ils recruté ?
- Au FBI ? A la NSA ?
- Ça n'a aucune importance.
Vous êtes dans le service public
depuis combien de temps ? 15, 16 ans ?
Et soudain, vous avez l'opportunité
d'être à la tête d'une affaire.
Vous voulez prendre les rênes,
faites donc.
Si vous pouvez.
Kyle, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Ce sont des mensonges.
- De quoi ?
Je n'ai rien à faire dans ces photos.
Je ne connais pas tous ces gens.
Bien que sûr que si.
Regarde. Ici, c'est toi au zoo
avec mamie Fran. Tu avais huit ans.
Tu te souviens ?
Et ici tu fêtais tes dix ans.
Tu te souviens de George ?
- C'était mon ami.
- Exactement.
Et Freddy,
tu te souviens sûrement de Freddy.
Il venait tout le temps à la maison
quand tu étais petit. Tu te rappelles ?
- Bugs Bunny.
- Oui.
- Il adorait les dessins animés.
- Ne me touche pas !
Je suis désolé. J'essaie juste de t'aider.
Ce n'est pas ma mémoire.
Tu es mon père. Je te reconnais,
mais je ne sais pas qui tu es.
C'est comme si tu étais un inconnu.
Kyle.
Kyle, regarde-moi.
Regarde-moi.
- J'ai besoin d'aide.
- Je veux t'aider.
- Pourquoi ne peux-tu pas m'aider ?
- J'essaie.
J'essaie.
J'essaie.
L'effet de cascade. Que veux-tu savoir ?
A la salle des théories,
toi et Marco dites toujours
que toutes les affaires
ont un effet de cascade.
Toutes sauf les meurtres
de Friday Harbor.
Et si ces attentats
en étaient la conséquence ?
Alors que Knox assassinait
des prostituées avant sa disparition,
il s'est mis à tuer des femmes au hasard
à son retour.
- Et si ce n'était pas au hasard ?
- Intéressant.
On devrait étudier les victimes de Knox.
Voir si on peut établir un lien.
<i>Bien qu'inexcusables, je comprends</i>
<i>la peur qui motive ces attentats.</i>
<i>Le meilleur moyen de stopper</i>
<i>la violence serait d'isoler les 4400.</i>
<i>Dans un endroit sûr,</i>
<i>pour eux et pour nous.</i>
<i>Certains d'entre vous doivent</i>
<i>me trouver dure, sans coeur même.</i>
<i>Je peux vous assurer</i>
<i>que ce n'est pas mon intention.</i>
<i>Tout comme je peux vous assurer</i>
<i>que parmi les 4400 certains...</i>
Le fourgon est prêt.
J'ai envie de les faire tous sauter.
Qu'ils brûlent tous en enfer.
- Hé ! J'étais en train d'écouter.
- J'en ai ras le bol de l'écouter.
- Elle est dans notre camp.
- C'est un parasite.
Elle se fiche de nous ou que notre soeur
se soit fait assassiner
par l'un de ces salauds de 4400.
Ok ?
Et si tu déchargeais le fertilisant ?
Laisse le filtre à air. Je ne supporte pas
ces satanées vapeurs.
Kyle !
Hé !
C'est bon de te revoir, mec.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais
assis par terre sous la pluie ?
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
Tu as l'air plutôt en forme.
A entendre tes parents,
on croirait que tu es un zombi.
Il ne me lâchent pas une seconde.
Ils me posent des questions
et m'épient sans cesse.
Ils sont contents de t'avoir avec eux.
C'était pareil avec ma mère.
Mes parents t'ont demandé de venir ici,
pour m'aider à me souvenir ?
- Non, Kyle. Hé !
- Je rentre.
- Il faut que je lise.
- Il faut que tu lises ?
Kyle !
Allez, quoi ! Je viens d'arriver.
Ce que tu en jettes !
A mon époque, j'aurais pu acheter
une voiture pour le prix de ce costume.
- Comment ça se passe ?
- On a beaucoup de boulot.
Cinq familles ont emménagé aujourd'hui.
Sept autres vont arriver.
J'ai 800 m de mur à étayer.
Les palissades sont trop courtes.
- Il faut tailler les arbres tout autour.
- Tout autour ?
Tant que tu travailleras ici, avec le bébé,
on se sentira en sécurité.
Deux résidents satisfaits.
C'est un début.
Ça a été une journée dingue.
Non, mon assistant n'est pas là.
Je n'ai pas eu le temps de retourner
tous mes appels. Et puis...
Mademoiselle Yates,
Dennis Ryland voudrait vous parler.
Dennis. Quelle agréable surprise !
C'est un peu théâtral,
vous ne croyez pas ?
- Lisez ça.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- C'est une histoire qui vous plaira.
- Sur les 4400 ?
Non, c'est à propos d'une présentatrice
impliquée dans un accident de voiture.
Un délit de fuite, pour être exact.
Une affaire sordide.
Le piéton qu'elle a renversé
est mort sur le coup.
Quel gâchis. C'était un homme
de 40 ans, père de trois enfants.
Pas étonnant qu'elle ait dépensé
une fortune pour couvrir l'affaire.
Alors...
Vous voulez me faire chanter, Dennis ?
Je me tais sur les 4400
et cette enveloppe va dans un coffre ?
Je crains que ce ne soit pas suffisant.
- Que voulez-vous que je fasse ?
- C'est trop tard.
Je vous ai fait une offre
et vous l'avez refusée.
Steve Smizick du bureau
du procureur général veut vous parler.
Il va vous inculper
pour homicide involontaire,
entre autres.
Regardez les choses en face.
Avec ou sans moi, les 4400
continueront de faire les gros titres.
Et à terme,
ils vous coûteront votre emploi.
On verra.
Au revoir, Barbara.
Vous croyez que ce soit
une sage décision, M. Collier ?
Réunir tous ces 4400 au même endroit
est très risqué.
C'est pourquoi
j'ai embauché une équipe de sécurité.
M. Tyler, je sais que vous voulez
protéger votre famille, mais sachez
qu'en restant ici,
vous courez un grave danger.
Peut-être.
Mais vous savez,
je suis né en 1922, dans le Missouri.
J'avais la peau aussi noire
que maintenant.
J'ai été confronté toute ma vie
aux incendies et aux lynchages.
Et j'en ai tiré un enseignement.
Un homme doit réagir face à l'adversité.
Et c'est ce que je fais ici.
- ...tordu la cheville.
- De l'autre côté.
- Maia, ta journée s'est bien passée ?
- Puis-je vous parler ?
Tu veux bien m'attendre un instant ?
Désolée d'être encore en retard.
C'est à cause...
Je crains que Maia
ne puisse plus venir à l'école.
Nous devons prendre en compte
la sécurité des autres élèves.
- Maia a créé des problèmes ?
- Non, elle est adorable.
C'est à cause des attentats.
Son nom étant sur la liste, c'est trop
risqué de la garder ici. Je suis désolée.
Je comprends.
Je suis désolée, Maia. On trouvera
une autre école, je te le promets.
- Ce n'est pas grave.
- Si, c'est grave. C'est injuste.
Ce que je veux dire, c'est que
quelqu'un va venir et tout arranger.
Il faut juste qu'on attende un peu.
DISPARUE LE 4 AOUT 1999
Tu as pris un coup de chaud.
Allez, fais-toi jolie.
Tu ne veux pas être jolie ?
Je préfère.
- C'est une amorce ?
- Un détonateur commercial.
Ce sera plus facile
d'en déterminer la provenance.
On va l'envoyer au labo
pour retrouver le numéro de série.
Que sait-on de la victime ?
Mary Denneville. 27 ans.
Le magasin de fleurs était à son père.
Elle avait disparu en 1999, mais avait
repris sa vie là où elle l'avait laissée.
Jusqu'à aujourd'hui.
Les gens ont-ils si peur des 4400 ?
Est-on trop impliqués pour le voir ?
Ce n'est pas de la peur.
C'est de la haine, pure et simple.
Baldwin.
Tout de suite ?
- Quoi ?
- Il faut qu'on y aille.
Nikki.
Shawn.
- J'ai quelque chose à te dire.
- Je sais.
- Je t'ai vue discuter avec Danny hier.
- Je veux juste que ce soit clair.
Je n'ai pas rompu avec Danny
à cause de toi. D'accord ?
D'accord.
Ça t'arrive parfois d'avoir envie
de t'échapper de ta vie
quelque temps ?
J'ai fait ça pendant trois ans.
Je te le déconseille.
- Tu sais ce que je veux dire.
- Ouais.
Trouver un endroit calme
où on peut croire que tout est simple.
Où personne n'est en colère
contre nous, ni blessé ou triste.
Je connais un endroit
exactement comme ça.
Viens. Je t'emmène. Tu veux ?
- Oui.
- Ok.
J'ai étudié vos dossiers.
Vous êtes les premiers enquêteurs
à qui je parle.
Vous semblez les mieux indiqués
pour démarrer.
On commence par qui,
Orson Bailey, Oliver Knox ?
Pourquoi pas Maia Rutledge ?
Huit ans. Disparue en 1946.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Sa famille d'accueil l'a ramenée
en quarantaine sans donner de raison.
Les rapports indiquent qu'elle fait
des prédictions qui s'avèrent vraies.
Suite à quoi, un de nos agents
la retire de la quarantaine.
Le rapport dit :
"Pour une étude plus poussée".
Mais vous n'avez pas rempli
d'autres rapports pourtant.
Tout a été fait avec l'aval de Ryland.
Je ne vois pas où est le problème.
Dossier suivant : Shawn Farrell, 17 ans.
Disparu en avril 2001.
C'est un peu maigre,
vous ne croyez pas ?
Dites-nous de quoi vous nous accusez,
qu'on puisse se remettre au travail.
Vous êtes de bons agents de terrain.
Mais vu vos conflits d'intérêts,
c'était une erreur
de vous laisser sur l'affaire des 4400.
Partager leur vécu nous permet
d'avoir une optique différente.
Vous avez affaire à des gangs,
il vous faut la brigade antigang.
En ce qui concerne les 4400,
aucun agent n'en sait plus que nous.
- C'est ce que Ryland pense ?
- Seul Ryland vous intéresse ?
Quelle ironie ! Il ne se passait
jamais rien à la division nord-ouest.
Ryland a été nommé ici en remerciement
de ses bons et loyaux services.
Un endroit pépère où finir sa carrière
avant de partir en retraite.
Mais son train-train a été interrompu
la nuit où les 4400 sont apparus.
Les choses vont changer ici,
que ça vous plaise ou non.
Si vous ne coopérez pas,
vous serez mis à l'écart.
- <i>Lily Moore veut vous voir.</i>
- Faites-la entrer.
Lily, que puis-je faire pour vous ?
Voyons. Du mérou ? Du filet mignon
de boeuf ? Du sushi au homard ?
Je vous ai demandé d'utiliser
la salle commune pour notre réunion,
pas de nous recevoir
en grandes pompes.
Quelle que soit l'occasion,
il faut bien manger.
Ça va être une soirée très intense.
Certains ont eu, tout comme moi,
des retrouvailles difficiles.
J'ai payé pour tout.
Vous a-t-on déjà dit
que vous vouliez tout contrôler ?
Une ou deux fois.
Vos excès de générosité peuvent
pousser les gens à se demander
ce que vous voulez en retour.
Vous avez l'air très sérieuse.
Lily, si j'ai fait quoi que ce soit
qui vous ait mise mal à l'aise...
C'est juste que...
vous vous pliez en quatre pour moi.
Vous me donnez plus que ce que
j'ai demandé ou ce dont j'ai besoin.
Vous savez que j'aime Richard ?
Vous êtes quelqu'un de très direct,
ce que je trouve charmant,
même si je sais que
ce n'était pas votre intention.
Pourquoi essaierais-je
de vous séparer de Richard ?
Je sais que ce serait peine perdue
et jamais je ne ferais une chose pareille.
Merci d'être passée.
J'espère qu'ils aimeront le homard.
La société de construction William
Wayne a acheté les amorces.
Compare la liste des employés
aux noms de l'affaire Knox.
J'ai déjà commencé.
- Si je trouve un lien, je t'appelle.
- Merci.
- Comment va-t-il ?
- Tu ferais mieux d'aller voir.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, fiston ?
Je cherche.
- Quoi ?
- Moi.
- C'est ici ?
- Oui.
Moi et mes 4399 amis les plus proches
avons surgi d'une boule de lumière ici.
C'est beau. Je me demande pourquoi
ils vous ont renvoyés ici ?
Pourquoi pas à la Maison blanche ?
Ou au milieu de Times Square ?
Peut-être que la vue leur plaisait.
- Tu crois ?
- Je n'en sais rien.
- Tu es vraiment nul.
- Tu ne t'en étais jamais aperçu ?
- Hé, fais voir ta main.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire ?
Laisse-moi faire. Reste...
Tout va bien.
Pour moi tu es toujours
la gamine de quatorze ans.
Plus maintenant.
Je sais.
Tom ? J'ai trouvé quelque chose.
Qu'est-ce que vous avez ?
Ils ne sont plus là.
- On a trouvé du fertilisant.
- Et des traces de pneu.
Ils ont un camion-bombe.
Les pneus correspondent
à ceux de la compagnie de téléphone.
On a trouvé un certain Dean Keating
dans leurs fichiers.
Comme Gail Keating,
la victime de Friday Harbor ?
- Dean est son frère aîné.
- Ce n'est pas tout.
Glenn, le frère de Gail, est maçon,
et sur son dernier chantier,
il manquait une vingtaine d'amorces.
Donc, un enlevé tue leur soeur
et ils se vengent.
Et les 4400 n'apparaissent plus
comme un danger mais des victimes.
L'effet de cascade.
Localisez le fourgon de Keating
et empêchez-le d'arriver à destination.
Où peut-il bien être ?
On recherche un camion-bombe.
Soyez extrêmement vigilants.
Entendu. Merci.
Le temps presse.
Ici ! Numéro 85. Ce véhicule
est assigné à Dean Keating.
Et il se dirige au nord vers...
Aurora.
Il file vers Richmond Highlands.
Il nous faut une liste de tous les 4400
à Richmond Highlands.
Il n'y a qu'un 4400 dans le coin.
C'est le neveu de Tom.
Tom, attends !
Communications. Mettez-moi en ligne
avec ce numéro de téléphone.
<i>Vous êtes chez les Farrell.</i>
<i>Nous ne sommes pas là.</i>
Susan, Shawn, Danny. Si vous
m'entendez, sortez de la maison !
<i>Il y a quelqu'un ?</i>
Le voilà. Numéro 85.
Descendez immédiatement !
Je veux voir vos mains !
Sortez du camion.
Nous voulons voir vos mains !
- Mais...
- Taisez-vous ! Restez à terre.
- Vous n'êtes pas Keating. Où est-il ?
- Il n'est pas venu.
Pas d'explosifs. Il n'y a rien, Tom.
Ils ont échangé les camions.
Ce n'est pas Keating. Allez ! On y va.
Ce n'était pas le bon camion.
Revérifiez les principales cibles.
Signalez tout ce qui est suspect.
Un fourgon surélevé
est garé près du complexe de Collier.
<i>Pas de plaque</i>
<i>et fraîchement repeint.</i>
La compagnie de téléphone utilise
les mêmes. Passez-nous Collier.
- Utilisez n'importe quelle ligne.
- <i>Elles sont coupées.</i>
Code rouge. Entrée principale.
Les voilà.
Descendez-moi.
Vas-y !
Je déclenche.
Va-t'en !
Les mains sur la tête !
Restez à terre !
A plat ventre !
Je vous arrête pour terrorisme.
Vous serez traité
comme un combattant ennemi.
Vous n'avez pas droit à un avocat.
Tout ce que vous direz
sera utilisé contre vous !
<i>Le docteur MacMillan est demandé...</i>
Docteur Mayhew ? Warren Lyttel,
ministère de la Sécurité intérieure.
Je dois vous parler
au sujet de Kyle Baldwin.
- Tom, viens vite !
- Quoi ?
Viens, je te dis !
Kyle !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je sais ce qui cloche chez moi.
- Je comprends enfin.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Kyle ?
Dis-moi !
Il y a une seule explication.
Pourquoi je me souviens de tout,
mais que je ne ressens rien.
Pourquoi tous ces gens dans ma vie
semblent être des étrangers.
Ce ne sont pas eux les étrangers.
C'est moi.
Je ne suis pas Kyle Baldwin.
Traduction : Firouz Benchelef
Dans les épisodes précédents...
Nous ne sommes pas sûrs.
On distingue quelque chose.
La boule a disparu. Des milliers
de personnes viennent d'apparaître.
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
Vous enquêterez
sur le retour des enlevés.
- On les laisse partir.
- On les laisse partir ?
Ce serait illégal de les garder.
Je suis Warren Lyttel.
On vous a averti de mon arrivée.
Je suis là pour recoller les pots cassés.
Les choses vont changer ici. Si vous ne
coopérez pas, vous serez mis à l'écart.
J'ai l'intention d'offrir un havre de paix
aux 4400 qui en ont besoin.
- J'aime Richard.
- Pourquoi voudrais-je vous séparer ?
Tant que tu travailleras ici, avec le bébé,
on se sentira en sécurité.
Deux résidents satisfaits.
C'est un début.
Maia Rutledge, huit ans.
Disparue en 1946.
Elle fait des prédictions
qui s'avèrent vraies.
Suite à quoi, un de nos agents
la retire de la quarantaine.
Je crains que Maia
ne puisse plus venir à l'école.
Nous devons prendre en compte
la sécurité des autres élèves.
- Ce n'est pas grave.
- Si, c'est grave.
Quelqu'un va venir et tout arranger.
Dossier suivant : Shawn Farrell, 17 ans.
Disparu en avril 2001.
C'est un peu maigre.
Je n'ai pas rompu avec Danny
à cause de toi.
Ok.
Je dois vous poser
quelques questions.
Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé.
J'ai juste posé mes mains sur lui,
et il s'est réveillé.
Ne me touche pas.
Je te reconnais,
mais je ne sais pas qui tu es.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais, fiston ?
- Je cherche.
- Quoi ?
- Moi.
Je comprends enfin.
Ce ne sont pas eux les étrangers.
C'est moi.
Je ne suis pas Kyle Baldwin.
Kyle.
Je ne suis pas Kyle.
- Qui es-tu alors ?
- Je n'en sais rien.
Il me faut plus d'écrans.
Votre fils présente
des troubles dissociatifs.
C'est courant chez les patients
qui sortent du coma.
Il ne se sent pas en phase
avec sa personnalité.
Il ne sait même plus qui il est.
C'est frustrant, mais vous avez bien fait
de le ramener ici.
- Et maintenant ?
- Il faut faire un autre IRM du crâne.
Ils viendront dans une heure
pour l'emmener en bas.
Je sais que c'est dur, Tom.
Mais Kyle revient de loin,
on ne peut pas baisser les bras.
Je crois que j'ai la monnaie exacte.
Salut, toi.
Merci.
- Tu le connais depuis longtemps ?
- Tony ? Environ deux ans.
- Il est gentil.
- Il est très gentil.
- Pourquoi dis-tu ça ?
- Il va tomber amoureux aujourd'hui.
Tony ? Mon Dieu. C'est génial.
- Pas de moi, quand même ?
- Non.
Je m'en doutais.
Quelque chose ne va pas, Maia ?
- Je vais rester longtemps comme ça ?
- Comme quoi ?
Je ne veux pas deviner les choses
avant qu'elles arrivent.
Je veux être normale, comme avant.
Ça va aller, ma puce.
- Et puis, qui est normal ?
- Toi.
Tu veux savoir un secret ?
Les gens normaux comme moi...
rêvent d'être exceptionnels,
comme toi.
Rallume la télévision.
Kyle, à la maison, tu as passé,
tout ton temps à regarder tes livres.
Ensuite les cartes, maintenant la télé.
Que cherches-tu ?
Peut-être qu'on peut t'aider à chercher.
Viens.
- Tu devrais rentrer te reposer.
- Je ne veux pas le laisser seul.
Bon, je vais chercher des affaires.
Je reviens dans une demi-heure.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Laissez-le tranquille !
Qui êtes-vous ?
J'appelle la sécurité.
Je suis l'agent Lyttel.
Je travaille avec votre mari.
Je me fiche de savoir
avec qui vous travaillez.
Dis à Tom que je sais
où je dois aller.
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
Il ne lui arrivera rien.
Dorénavant, le gouvernement
contrôlera ses soins médicaux.
Vous l'avez emmené de force ?
Vous avez perdu la tête ?
C'est le seul à avoir été témoin
d'un enlèvement.
Il ignore jusqu'à son nom !
On l'aidera à se souvenir.
Sa mère est bouleversée.
Ça peut se comprendre.
- Mais Washington m'a envoyé...
- Tom !
Où est mon fils ?
- Lâchez-moi.
- Vous allez me répondre ?
- Ryland ? Vous allez m'aider ?
- Je me tâte.
- Où est Kyle ?
- Ça suffit, Tom.
- Rangez votre arme.
- Dennis...
Tom, rangez votre arme.
- Il fallait me laisser lui mettre une balle.
- J'ai failli.
Mais tuer Lyttel ne ramènera pas Kyle.
Mais ça m'aurait fait un bien fou.
Pourquoi Kyle ?
Pourquoi pas Shawn ?
Nos docteurs ont effectué
des tas de tests sur Shawn.
Kyle est une énigme pour eux.
Une énigme ?
- C'est de mon fils qu'on parle.
- Je sais.
- Tu ne peux pas appeler Washington ?
- A quoi bon ?
C'est Washington
qui a mis Lyttel sur l'affaire.
- Ils soutiennent ses décisions.
- Alors on ne fait rien ?
- Je n'ai pas dit ça. On ramènera Kyle.
- Quand ?
Je n'en sais rien. Je ne suis
au courant que depuis une heure.
J'ignore où Lyttel l'a emmené.
Je regrette, Dennis.
Je ne vais pas rester ici,
les bras croisés.
Je vais chercher mon fils.
Lâche-moi.
On se connaît depuis longtemps.
Mais si tu décides de faire cavalier seul,
ne compte pas sur moi.
Je sais.
Tom, que s'est-il passé
entre toi et Lyttel ?
Demande à Ryland.
- Tom !
- Quoi ?
- Si tu as des ennuis, je dois le savoir.
- Pourquoi ?
- Je pourrai peut-être t'aider.
- Reste en dehors de ça, d'accord ?
Prends le volant.
La créance de sang est bonne,
les taux du facteur Rh sont normaux
et votre taux de calcium est bon.
Comment vous sentez-vous, Lily ?
- C'est dur parfois.
- Il fallait s'y attendre.
Bon, où en étais-je ?
Ah oui ! Je vais devoir encore prélever
du liquide amniotique.
Pourquoi ? Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Quel type d'anomalie génétique ?
Elle a juste dit qu'elle voulait
analyser un des chromosomes du bébé.
Tout ira bien.
Ça va être un superbe 18 trous.
Vous jouez au golf ?
- J'ai bien peur que non.
- Quel dommage.
Vous savez, ce docteur
que vous nous avez recommandé...
Roxanne Kern. C'est la meilleure gynéco
du Nord-Ouest pacifique.
Vous êtes en de bonnes mains.
Comment s'est passée la réunion ?
- Bien, merci.
- Ils ont aimé les petits fours ?
Je dois dire que le sushi au homard
était une très bonne idée.
Il suffit de me faire confiance.
Votre fiancée
a beaucoup d'imagination.
Elle croyait que j'essayais
de vous la souffler.
- Vous arrivez à y croire ?
- Euh... pas vraiment.
Vous voyez ?
Vous vous inquiétiez pour rien.
Je n'étais pas inquiète.
- Il faut qu'on lui dise.
- Il vaut mieux que ce soit moi.
Quand ?
Bientôt.
Je n'en peux plus de me cacher.
- En plus, tu me manques.
- Toi aussi tu me manques.
Tu soupçonnais Shawn d'avoir
ce don depuis sa fête d'arrivée
et tu ne m'en as jamais parlé.
- Je n'ai rien dit non plus à Linda.
- Vous allez divorcer !
- Je suis ta coéquipière.
- Je sais.
Quand on t'a affectée aux 4400,
tu les traitais de virus.
Tu n'as pas remarqué
que j'ai changé ?
Je te signale
que l'une d'entre eux vit avec moi.
- D'accord, tu as raison.
- Je t'en aurais parlé.
C'est bon, j'ai compris.
- Tu vas continuer longtemps ?
- Comme tu voudras.
- Que va-t-on faire pour Kyle ?
- "On" ?
Bien sûr, "on".
On va le retrouver
et le ramener à la maison.
Alors on ferait mieux de s'y mettre.
Je regrette, M. Collier est occupé.
Je lui dirai de vous rappeler.
Merci, docteur Kern.
Le docteur Kern, la gynécologue ?
Jordan va avoir un bébé ?
Je n'en sais rien.
Voici les dossiers sécuritaires
qu'il a demandés.
Je les déposerai sur son bureau.
Puis-je voir
les relevés des appels de Jordan ?
Pourquoi ?
Il a reçu des lettres de menace.
Je veux les vérifier par recoupement
avec ses appels.
Ils ne doivent pas quitter ce bureau.
<i>J'ai besoin de voir le docteur Kern</i>
<i>tout de suite.</i>
<i>M. Tyler, elle ne peut être dérangée.</i>
- M. Tyler !
- Je n'en ai pas pour longtemps.
- Il n'a pas voulu m'écouter.
- Lily a rendez-vous ?
Non. Pourquoi appelez-vous M. Collier
chaque fois qu'elle vient vous voir ?
- Qui j'appelle ne vous regarde pas.
- Je n'en suis pas si sûr.
Qu'est-ce que Collier
sait de plus sur le bébé de Lily ?
La drépanocytose ?
Comment mon bébé peut-il avoir
le trait drépanocytaire ?
A moins que le père soit noir.
Peut-être qu'il l'est.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire, Richard ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Peut-être que ceux qui nous ont enlevés
m'ont utilisé comme donneur.
Pourquoi Jordan aurait demandé
au Dr Kern de nous cacher ça ?
Le bébé est porteur
du trait drépanocytaire.
Il a peut-être peur
que ça nous rapproche.
Peut-être.
Il est grand temps que j'aille lui parler.
Michelle Hickock, enlevée numéro 938.
Elle vient voir la psy à 16h00.
Je veux lui parler après, d'accord ?
Il s'est connecté.
Lyttel est sur le réseau.
Tu es prête ?
Tom apprécie vraiment ton aide.
Je ne fais pas ça pour Tom.
Allez.
Kyle est au centre de quarantaine,
bâtiment 9, sous-sol 3.
Super. Je te revaudrai ça.
Bon...
- Marco, merci pour ton aide.
- Il n'y a pas de quoi.
- Tu es prête ?
- Il vaudrait mieux y aller après 17h00.
- L'effectif est réduit de moitié.
- Je passe te prendre à 16h00.
A plus.
C'est ici. C'est juste à la périphérie
de la ville, à West Belleview.
Le vendeur ne sera pas là ?
Un autre agent immobilier
m'a dit qu'il était en Espagne.
- Ce sera un endroit sûr.
- Occupe-toi de tout.
- Fais attention qu'on ne te suive pas.
- Je suis surveillée ?
Si j'étais Lyttel, je te tiendrais à l'oeil.
Vérifie ton rétroviseur et ne panique pas.
Je vais devoir me servir
de ce que tu m'as appris.
Tout se passera bien.
- On se retrouve là-bas.
- Je vous attendrai.
- Fais attention.
- Promis.
Elles sont belles, hein ? Je sais combien
tu aimes les pierres de lune.
Oui, mais je ne peux pas les accepter.
Pourquoi ? Je les ai achetées pour toi.
Ecoute, Nikki.
Je sais que j'ai foiré.
- Shawn ne t'a rien dit ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a à voir là-dedans ?
Nikki ?
Salut. Maia est prête ?
Maia discute avec un de vos collègues.
Certains habits sont bizarres.
Les voitures aussi.
Par contre, j'aime bien les jeux vidéo.
Tu aimais bien les jeux vidéo
en quarantaine ?
Je n'ai pas souvent eu
l'occasion d'y jouer.
Lyttel, que faites-vous ici ?
Je discute avec Maia.
J'avais hâte de la rencontrer.
- Ne vous approchez pas d'elle.
- Ce n'est pas à vous d'en décider.
Ça m'a fait plaisir
de discuter avec toi.
On se reverra bientôt.
Je ne l'aime pas.
Et lui non plus il ne m'aime pas vraiment.
Tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter à cause de lui.
- Tu en es sûre ?
- Ecoute-moi bien, Maia.
J'en suis certaine.
Je ne laisserai personne te faire du mal.
- D'accord ?
- D'accord.
Jordan, vous avez une minute ?
Je sais pourquoi vous êtes ici.
Roxanne Kern m'a appelé
dès que vous avez quitté son cabinet.
J'espère que vous et Lily
n'allez pas faire un scandale
parce qu'un docteur
fait des excès de zèle.
Nous vous sommes reconnaissants
pour la maison et mon emploi.
Grâce à vous,
nos vies sont bien plus confortables.
- Je sens que vous allez me faire mal.
- Laissez-nous tranquilles.
Arrêtez de vous immiscer dans nos vies.
C'est comme vous voulez.
Passez le bonjour à Lily, vous voulez ?
Ce sera fait.
- Tu es prête ?
- Donne-moi une seconde.
Gloria, n'ouvrez surtout pas la porte
aux inconnus, d'accord ?
Bien.
- Tu t'en vas maintenant ?
- Oui, je serai là quand tu te réveilleras.
Il faut que je me sauve. Ciao.
- Diana.
- Ne vous en faites pas.
- Vous allez le retrouver.
- Retrouver qui ?
Votre fils, Kyle.
C'est lui, la réponse.
- La réponse à quoi ?
- A tout.
Je veux voir Kyle Baldwin, s'il vous plaît.
- Vous n'êtes pas sur la liste.
- Je suis une amie de la famille.
Je veux m'assurer qu'il va bien.
Il ne fait pas partie des 4400,
son père travaille avec moi
et si je pouvais lui ramener
des nouvelles...
On est censés être
dans le même camp, non ?
- Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
- Merci infiniment. C'est super.
Vous n'aurez même pas mal à la tête
à votre réveil.
Un petit peu peut-être.
Tu peux rentrer.
Kyle, c'est moi.
- Highland Beach.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- C'est là où il faut que j'aille.
- Highland Beach.
Sortons d'ici d'abord.
Allez, debout.
Il est avec nous.
Il est assis à côté de moi.
Il est dans le même état.
Pas pire, en tout cas.
A bientôt.
- Elle est loin, cette maison ?
- A environ 45 kilomètres.
Ta mère t'attend.
Non. Highland Beach.
Kyle ! Lâche le volant !
Highland Beach !
- Lâche-le ! Lâche-le !
- Calme-toi !
- Il faut y aller maintenant.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a là-bas ?
- C'est là que Shawn a disparu.
- Il faut que j'y retourne.
Calme-toi, fiston.
- Si c'est ce que tu veux, on va y aller.
- Tu en es sûr ?
Kyle est la réponse, non ?
Deux agents opèrent
en dehors de l'équipe.
J'ai remarqué. C'est parce que vous
avez enlevé le fils Baldwin de l'hôpital.
- Washington verrait ça d'un autre oeil.
- C'est eux qui vous ont envoyé ici.
On va le ramener ou non ?
Trouvez-le.
Ces gens vont venir
à la prochaine réunion.
Il va y avoir plus de monde,
il faudrait deux tables de plus.
- Je m'en occupe.
- Merci.
Je peux vous parler une minute ?
- J'ai quelques courses à faire.
- Ce ne sera pas long.
Où avez-vous trouvé ça ?
Par mesure de sécurité, j'ai vérifié
les antécédents des résidents.
Ne soyez pas outrée, Lily.
Nombreux sont ceux
qui aimeraient me voir échouer.
Un tel scandale leur permettrait
de m'évincer de la société.
- Jamais Richard ne ferait ça.
- C'est ce que je croyais aussi.
Apparemment
nous avions tous les deux tort.
Vous croyez vraiment que cela
va changer mes sentiments pour lui ?
C'est à vous de décider.
Mais Lily... il est important
que vous vous demandiez...
Vous voulez que ce soit
cet homme qui élève votre enfant ?
Tu ne dis rien ?
Je fêtais mes 23 ans.
Des types de la caserne
m'ont proposé d'aller dans un bar.
- Tu ne bois pas.
- En ce temps-là non plus.
Mais c'était difficile
de refuser leur invitation.
En ce temps-là, les Noirs et les Blancs
ne se fréquentaient guère.
Alors, j'y suis allé.
C'était sympa, tu sais ?
Une femme s'est mise à me draguer.
Tout le monde nous regardait.
Alors je me suis dit qu'il valait mieux
que je mette les voiles.
Elle m'a suivi
et m'a invité à aller chez elle.
J'ai poliment refusé.
C'est alors qu'elle s'est mise à hurler.
- C'est tout ce qui s'est passé ?
- Il n'en fallait pas plus en 1945.
Mais la déclaration qu'elle a faite
à la police... Je veux dire...
- Elle est si détaillée.
- C'est un tissu de mensonges.
Si je n'avais pas été innocenté,
tu crois que j'aurais pu devenir pilote
dans l'armée de l'air ?
Elle avait menti.
J'ai été acquitté.
- Pourquoi Jordan m'en aurait-il parlé ?
- Il veut que tu doutes de moi.
De nous.
Tu me crois ?
Faisons vite nos bagages.
Il faut qu'on parte d'ici.
Ils se dirigent à l'ouest vers Sandburg.
Il n'y a pas d'autoroute
dans cette direction.
Highland Beach. C'est ici qu'ils vont.
Amenez ma voiture devant.
Faites ce que bon vous semble,
mais ne m'importunez pas.
Sans blague, maman ? Tu veux
qu'on aille tous les deux au cinéma ?
Pourquoi pas ?
On y allait tout le temps avant.
Quand j'avais six ans.
Espèce de salaud !
- Ecoute...
- Sale monstre !
Danny, arrête !
Arrêtez, je vous en prie !
Danny, Shawn, arrêtez !
Arrête de m'en vouloir pour Nikki !
Ne vois-tu donc pas
que c'est fini entre vous deux ?
Ça suffit ! Shawn, arrête !
Tu vas le tuer !
- Qu'est-ce que tu lui as fait ?
- Ce n'était pas volontaire !
- Danny !
- Ne t'approche pas de lui !
Shawn ?
- Je vous ai entendus crier.
- Ne me touche pas.
Quoi ?
Ne me touche pas.
Tu es la seule chose de bien
qui me soit arrivée depuis mon retour.
Mais je ne peux pas rester ici
et tu ne peux pas aller où je vais.
Shawn...
Je t'aime, Nikki.
- Je t'aime.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ? Shawn !
Non ! Reste ici, parlons-en.
Shawn ! Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
- A votre avis ?
Vous avez pensé
à ce que vous faites ?
- C'est dangereux à l'extérieur.
- On part quand même.
- Lily, pensez au bébé.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a à voir là-dedans ?
Ce bébé est peut-être la clé du futur
et personne ne peut le protéger
mieux que moi.
- Monte dans la voiture.
- Je ne peux pas vous laisser partir.
Ne vous approchez pas d'elle.
Allez-y ! Enfuyez-vous !
Ça ne vous mènera à rien.
Je vous retrouverai.
Ce bébé m'appartient.
Kyle !
On marche depuis dix minutes.
Qu'est-ce que tu cherches ?
Peut-être qu'on peut t'aider.
C'est ici qu'on l'a trouvé.
Le temps presse.
Je t'ai amené ici
comme tu me l'as demandé.
Si tu as quelque chose à faire,
tu ferais mieux de te dépêcher.
Je viens d'ici.
J'ai essayé de toutes mes forces et...
quoique je fasse, où que j'aille, tout...
Tout foire.
J'ai besoin de m'aérer l'esprit
et de m'éloigner quelque temps.
En fait, je voulais vous demander
si je pouvais rester un peu ici.
Shawn, tu fais partie des 4400.
En ce qui me concerne,
tu peux rester ici tant que tu veux.
C'est super. Merci.
Alors, parle-moi un peu de ton don.
- Tu sais où on va ?
- Je le saurai quand je le verrai.
Il va se lancer à notre poursuite.
Ça plaît au bébé.
Tu sais...
Ça ne serait pas si mal, non ?
Si c'était toi le père ?
Non, ça ne serait pas mal du tout.
C'est leur voiture. Allons-y.
Ecoutez, ce ne sont pas des criminels.
Ils sont avec nous.
Gardez vos armes dans leur étui.
Il est inutile de recourir à la violence.
Kyle, ils sont ici pour toi.
Ils veulent t'emmener.
C'est trop tard.
- Kyle !
- Non ! Tom, arrête !
<i>Kyle ?</i>
<i>Tom.</i>
- <i>Tu n'es pas mon fils, n'est-ce pas ?</i>
- <i>Non.</i>
<i>Kyle était une enveloppe,</i>
<i>un moyen de communiquer.</i>
- <i>Communiquer avec qui ?</i>
- <i>Avec vous.</i>
<i>Pour vous guider dans vos relations</i>
<i>avec les enlevés.</i>
<i>Mais il y a eu un problème.</i>
<i>Shawn a interrompu le processus.</i>
<i>C'est ce qui l'a plongé dans le coma.</i>
<i>Il est resté trois ans dans cet état.</i>
Tom !
<i>Qui êtes-vous ? Qu'êtes-vous ?</i>
<i>Je suis un être humain.</i>
- <i>Comme vous.</i>
- <i>Non. Tu es complètement différent.</i>
<i>Je viens d'une période différente.</i>
<i>C'est tout.</i>
<i>Votre futur.</i>
<i>C'est là où vous les avez emmenés ?</i>
<i>Mon neveu et tous les autres ?</i>
- <i>Nous avions besoin d'eux.</i>
- <i>Pour quoi ?</i>
<i>Pour survivre.</i>
Skouris !
Skouris !
<i>Dans le futur,</i>
<i>l'humanité est en train de s'éteindre.</i>
<i>Tu veux dire que</i>
<i>ça va être la fin du monde ?</i>
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Kyle nous a emmenés ici.
- Il devait savoir ce qui allait se passer.
- Peut-être que ce n'est pas Kyle.
Il disait que ce n'était pas lui.
Il dit peut-être la vérité.
Tom, ça va ?
Il faut agir. Et s'il emmenait Baldwin
avec lui ? S'il le tuait ?
Ne faites rien tant qu'on ne saura pas
ce qui se passe.
<i>Seuls les enlevés peuvent empêcher</i>
<i>une telle catastrophe de se produire.</i>
<i>C'est pourquoi ils ont été modifiés</i>
<i>et réintégrés dans la ligne du temps.</i>
<i>Pourquoi ici ? Pourquoi maintenant ?</i>
<i>Parce que c'est ici que commença</i>
<i>le sentier de l'oubli.</i>
<i>Et comment les enlevés</i>
<i>vont-ils empêcher ça ?</i>
<i>Ils ont déjà commencé.</i>
<i>Et vous aussi.</i>
- Tom, sors de là.
- Si vous ne faites rien, j'y vais.
Il faut que tu sortes de là.
<i>Je ne comprends pas.</i>
<i>Que sommes-nous censés faire ?</i>
- <i>Vous devez les aider.</i>
- <i>Comment ?</i>
Allez-y !
<i>Comment ?</i>
<i>Tu saignes.</i>
Oh, mon Dieu.
Appelez une ambulance. Vite !
Kyle !
Kyle ! Tiens bon.
Tiens bon !
Ne me laisse pas ! Regarde-moi !
Regarde-moi ! Tiens bon !
Non !
Kyle ! Regarde-moi !
Tiens bon, Kyle ! Ne me quitte pas !
Tiens bon ! Je t'en prie !
- Non !
- Tom...
- Papa ?
- Kyle !
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ici ?
- Où est Shawn ?
- Kyle ?
- Je peux tout t'expliquer pour la bière.
- Non !
Ne t'en fais pas.
Tu n'as pas à te justifier.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tom.
Qu'est-ce que vous avez vu ?
Je t'ai enfin avec moi, Kyle.
SIX MOIS PLUS TARD
Le bébé.
C'est le moment ?
Je vais chercher la voiture.

Au cours des 60 dernières années
4400 personnes ont été enlevées
Toutes sont revenues en même temps
sans aucun souvenir
d’où elles étaient
Elles n’avaient pas vieilli d’un jour
et certaines sont revenues
avec de nouvelles capacités
Toutes essaient de renouer...
...avec une vie interrompue
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le Salut.
Le monde devra faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans les 4400...
Je dois parler à Shawn.
Dis lui qu’il ne peut pas
rompre avec moi.
Ce serait une erreur.
Isabelle n’abandonnera pas,
pas sans se battre.
Je ne veux pas que cette relation s’achève...
donc elle ne s’achèvera pas.
Je sais que je n’ai pas toujours,
été là pour toi, Kyle,
mais je croyais que nous avions
plutôt une bonne relation.
C’est vrai. C’est juste...
que, grandir avec un père qui
travaille pour le FBI, au NTAC
ça peut être assez intense, tu sais?
Tu étais censé dire, “ Je le voulais”.
Ne tente pas le diable.
Je t’ai dit ce que nous faisions,
et tu l’as utilisé pour me trahir.
Ryland est responsable de la mort de
28 des 4400,
28 personnes qui auraient pu changer
le monde en mieux, si on leur avait
permis de vivre
Alana va être poursuivie tout comme
n’importe quelle membre du groupe Nova.
Tu es l’un des seuls hommes bien
qui continuent de se battre.
Je trouverai un moyen de te ramener.
Je le promets.
Salut, Erika.
Ne t’approche pas.
Je ne vais pas te faire
de mal, Erika.
Je veux juste te parler.
C’est toujours ce que tu dis.
C’est comme ça que tu m’attirais
dans ta chambre.
Je ne plaisante pas.
Je le jure.
cette fois je suis sérieuse.
Je ne te laisserai pas me toucher!
C’est bon.
Oncle Patrick est ici.
Tom Baldwin?
J’ai besoin de vos initiales sous la croix.
Qu’est-ce que c’est?
Désolé, vieux. Je ne suis pas médium.
"Ce n’est pas ton dîner. Tiens bon. Diana."
Baldwin.
Jarvis dit que c’est un suicide.
Une idée de pourquoi on nous a appelé?
Pas vraiment.
Elle a dit qu’il y a un agent de
la D.E.A sur place.
Apparemment, il a réclamé la présence du NTAC.
Hé, au fait, merci pour les cookies.
C’était très attentionné.
des cookies?
Ouais. Le panier de cookies.
Ceux que tu as envoyés.
Pourquoi tu me regardes comme ça?
Je ne t’ai rien envoyé,Tom.
En fait, j’allais te remercier.
Remercier? Pourquoi?
J’ai eu un panier rempli de cookies,
moi aussi, il y a une heure,de ta part,
Du moins, c’est ce que disait la carte.
Moi non plus, je ne t’ai rien envoyé.
Vous êtes du NTAC, vous deux?
Oui.
Matt Ruddy.
Je suis de la D.E.A.
Entrez.
Je suis certain que vous trouverez ça
intéressant.
Son nom est Erika Lundgren.
Elle est notre troisième suicide
de la semaine.
Pourquoi la D.E.A enquête sur des suicides?
Parce que l’on pense qu’ils ont tous un lien.
Depuis les six dernières semaines,
On entend parler de cette nouvelle drogue
qui arpente les rues.
Elle s’appelle "blink."
On en a eu un échantillon d’un dealer
qu’on a arrêté.
Mais pourquoi nous appeler? Ce n’est
pas vraiment dans nos prérogatives.
On a fait analyser l’échantillon.
Un des composants que nos gars du labo  ont isolé,
ne ressemble à rien de connu,
alors, ils ont approfondis leurs recherches.
C’est similaire à ce qu’on a trouvé dans les 4400.
Comment vous l’appelez déjà? Promicine?
Dons, quoi, cette drogue, la “ blink ”
vous pensez que c’est un des 4400 qui
la synthétise ?
C’est pour ça que je vous ai appelé.
Si l’un des 4400 est impliqué,
Je me suis dis que vous pourriez nous
aider à le repérer.
Absolument.
Ca nous aiderait d’en savoir plus
sur cette drogue.
On n’en sait pas trop,
sauf que ça à l’air d’être un
puissant hallucinogène.
Et bien, comment savez-vous qu’Erika Lundgren
était sous “ blink ” quand elle a sauté ?
Sa colocataire nous l’a dit.
Erika a pris de la “blink” ce matin.
Presque juste après,
elle a commencé à dire qu’elle voyait
son oncle.
Elle flippait vraiment.
je veux dire, ce mec est en prison
pour au moins encore 12 ans.
Savez-vous où elle s'est procuré la drogue?
Quand Erika voulais se défoncer,
elle allait voir ce type avec
qui elle allait à l'école.
Je pense qu'il deal maintenant.
Je veux dire, je ne sais pas si
c'est là qu'elle l'a eue,
mais son nom c'est Greg.
En général il traîne à Cowen Park.
Il porte toujours cette vieille
veste d'université.
Erika disait qu'il avait un stand ou quelque chose comme ça
Tony.
Prends soin d'elle.
Merci.
On devrait probablement aller
à Cowen Park,
découvrir où ce Greg se procure sa "blink".
Bonjour Tommy.
Papa ?
Hey, Tommy,
tu es au milieu de la rue.
Tu ferais mieux de faire attention.
Tom ?
Tom, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Aller. Sors de la route.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Diana, ce type de la D.E.A. ,
il a dit que la "blink" donnait
des hallucinations, n'est-ce pas ?
Bien sûr. Pourquoi ?
Parce que je crois que je viens
de voir mon père.
Il était juste là.
Tom, ton père est mort il y a 9 ans.
Précisément.
--- TEAM 4400 ---  Episode 8  Saison 3
Merci a The lovers , Mamaroulia , Lucie et Annagibbs
Un spécial Thanks a Rubeus et Choucas777 qui m'ont aidé en pleine nuit.
www.séries-vo.com
C'était les gâteaux.
Ca ne peut être que ça.
Tom, doucement.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'on voudrait
te faire prendre de la "blink" ?
Je ne sais pas.
Peut-être un 4400 amer qui haît le NTAC.
Oui, peut-être, mais j'ai aussi
mangé un gâteau.
Je ne vois aucun parent mort. Je me sens bien.
Tom, tu as subi beaucoup de stress
ces derniers temps.
Toutes ces histoires d'hallucinations...
ton esprit a juste décidé de te jouer des tours.
Oui. Peut-être.
Je pense quand même que je ferais
mieux de conduire.
Alors, de quoi tu veux parler ?
Diana, est-ce que tu le vois?
Vois qui ?
Mon père. Il est juste là.
Tom, Je ne vois rien.
Personne d'autre ne peux me voir.
Je suis juste là pour toi.
Tais-toi. Tu n'est pas réel.
Ecoute-moi Tom. Il n'y a personne ici.
Réel ou pas réel, Je suis là,
et tu vas avoir a faire à moi.
Qu’est-ce que tu veux, papa ?
Ce n’est pas ce que je veux. C’est ce que tu veux.
Tu es celui qui m’a emmené ici.
Ca doit être pour me dire quelque chose.
Je n’ai rien à te dire.
Tom, écoute-moi. Il n’y a personne ici.
Tu dois juste essayer de te calmer.
Si, il y a quelqu’un, Diana. Il est juste...
Il est parti.
Il était juste ici, Diana. Je le jure.
Tom, je vais t’emmener au centre médical du NTAC, d’accord ?
Ca va aller.
C’était bien.
Tu vois ? Ca marche toujours parfaitement entre nous.
Je suis contente que tu sois revenu.
Isabelle, pas maintenant, OK ?
J’ai des choses à faire.
Ca peut attendre.
Isabelle...
Cette fois, si tu veux,
je peux te faire penser que je suis quelqu’un d’autre.
Quelqu’un qui a toujours été un fantasme ?
Je peux déplacer la Terre pour nous.
Littérallement.
Isabelle, tu n’as pas besoin d’utiliser tes dons pour me séduire.
Crois-moi, tu y arrive très bien toute seule.
Je dois y aller.
Tu n’es jamais parti juste après.
Nous avons raté quelque chose, non ?
Je veux dire, nous allons toujours bien ensemble et tout,
mais ce n’est plus pareil, n’est-ce pas ?
Non, c’est vrai.
Et nous continuons à faire semblant que tout est comme avant.
Je continue à faire semblant.
Ca marche comment pour toi ?
Pas bien.
Je pense que je sais ce que nous avons à faire.
Bien.
Je suis heureuse que tu t’en rendes compte aussi.
Nous devons nous marier.
C’est la seule manière d’être sûrs de ne jamais nous perdre.
Isabelle...
Toi, tu vas faire ce que tu as à faire.
Je vais commencer à réfléchir à la liste des invités.
Votre scan est correct,
mais votre pression sanguine est encore un peu élevée.
A part ça, vos organes vitaux sont constants.
Et ses résultats du labo ? Aucune drogue dans son organisme ?
Sa toxicologie est négative, mais ce n’est pas surprenant,
parce que nous ne savons encore pas trop comment tester la “blink*”.
(* drogue inventée pour la série)
Nous vous avons administré un léger sédatif,
mais c’est tout ce que nous pouvons faire pour le moment.
Alors je peux rentrer à la maison, c’est ça ?
Je n’ai pas vu mon père en, quoi, six heures.
Eh bien, généralement, il faut compter environ 48 heures pour qu’un psychotrope quitte un organisme.
Nous ne savons pas grand chose sur la “blink”.
Donc il est impossible de dire combien de temps les effets vont durer.
Ou à quel point ils seront importants.
Les hallucinogènes affectent en général chaque personne différemment.
Ca dépend du genre de questions que porte votre subconscient.
Très bien, je vais demander à Garrity de vous raccompagner tous les 2.
Vous prenez quelques jours de repos tous les 2.
Je n’ai pas besoin de quelques jours. Je me sens bien.
Oui, mais tu as mangé les cookies aussi.
Et jusqu’à ce que nous soyons sûrs que le produit a disparu de votre organisme,
vous êtes tous les 2 en congé maladie.
J’ai parlé à ton père de notre conversation.
Nous voulions te parler ensemble.
Je ne sais pas si tu es sérieuse au sujet de cette proposition de mariage,
mais nous devons y mettre fin tout de suite.
Nous 2 mariés, ce n’est pas une bonne idée.
Vous êtes trop jeunes tous les 2,
et aucun de vous 2 n’êtes prêts pour ce type d’engagement.
Je ne peux pas le permettre.
Je suis ton père,
et je te dis que ça ne se produira pas.
Ton père parle pour nous 2.
Cette histoire n’ira pas plus loin.
Je comprends ce que vous dites.
Il y a des millions de raisons pour lesquelles nous ne devrions pas nous marier.
Il y en a davantage pour que nous le fassions.
Aucun de vous n’a jamais pensé que peut-être cette relation était destinée à exister ?
Que Shawn et moi étions faits pour nous rencontrer, pour tomber amoureux ?
Isabelle, je ne t’aime pas.
Shawn, toi et moi, nous sommes les 2 personnes les plus puissantes de la planète.
Nous sommes censés être ensemble. Qui d’autre est assez bien pour toi ?
Isabelle, cet homme est en train de te dire directement
qu’il ne veut pas t’épouser. Devons-nous être encore plus clairs ?
Tu dois l’accepter.
Non.
Je ne l’accepte pas.
A vrai dire, vous devez tous 2 changer votre façon de penser.
Ca aiderait peut-être si vous le voyiez comme un mariage arrangé.
L’avenir veut que nous soyons ensemble.
Nous serons ensemble.
Je m’en assurerai.
Tu es sûre que ça va aller seule ?
Parce que je peux rester avec toi si tu veux.
Non, je vais bien.
Avec de la chance, ces choses diminuent déjà.
Eh bien, appelle si t’as besoin de quelque chose.
Je le ferai.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit.
OK, Garrity, tu peux m’emmener à la maison maintenant.
Salut Diana.
Josh ?
C’est bon de te voir.
Tu sembles...differente.
Tu sembles exactement pareil.
Que fais-tu ici ?
Il y a des choses dont on doit parler.
Je ne pense pas.
Je veux dire, nous n’avons pas parlé en, quoi, 11 ans ?
Je ne vois pas une seule raison de changer ça.
C’est un peu dur, tu ne crois pas ?
Nous avons été ensemble longtemps.
Non, tu m’as quitté il y a longtemps.
Il y a une différence.
Tu vas bien ?
On aurait dit que tu te parlais à toi-même.
Non. Je vais bien.
Je pense que j’ai pris une dose de “blink” aussi.
Vraiment.
Qui as-tu vu ?
Personne.
Juste un gars que je connaissais.
Tu étais fiancée ?
Oui. A l’université.
J’ai dû prendre des cours de physique.
Josh Sandler était l’assistant du prof,
et nous sommes sortis ensemble pendant 3 ans.
Je suis désolé. Je sais que c’est une grosse surprise.
Oui, eh bien, tu n’en as jamais rien dit.
Eh bien, ce n’est pas quelque chose dont j’aime particulièrement parler.
Euh, je ne veux pas paraître jaloux d’une hallucination,
mais...tu dois beaucoup penser à ce gars, hein ?
Tom voit son père.
Tu sais, ça a un sens.
Tous les pères sont profondément enfouis dans le psychisme de leurs enfants.
Erika Lundgren voyait son oncle.
Qui sait quel genre d’histoire ils avaient ?
Ecoute, je ne peux pas répondre pour elle,
mais je peux te dire que Josh et moi avons une histoire chargée,
et que la majeure partie de cette histoire n’est pas bonne.
Nous avons eu une dispute environ 10 jours avant le mariage qui a tout annulé.
C’était horrible.
Tu veux en parler ?
Non.
La dernière chose que j’ai envie de faire, c’est de parler de Josh Sandler.
Ecoute, je suis épuisée,
et je veux juste prendre une douche et aller au lit.
Tu veux de la compagnie ?
Non, pas ce soir.
Je t’appelle dans la matinée.
OK.
Tu as toute la place pour toi maintenant, hein ?
Beaucoup de pièces pour un homme seul.
Tu sais, maintenant qu’Alana est partie,
tu devrais songer à vendre,
prendre quelque chose comme un appartement.
Merci pour la suggestion, papa.
Je me sens bien ici.
Tu la gardes toujours pour le retour de ton fils, hein ?
Je dois te le dire, mon pote,
je ne pense pas que ça va arriver.
Hé, ne sois pas fâché.
J’essaie d’avoir une conversation,
sauf que tu ne dis rien.
Je ne saurais même pas par où commencer.
Choisis un sujet.
Bien. Parlons de mon enfance.
Je détestais rentrer à la maison quand je savais que tu allais y être.
Tu étais méchant avec maman. Tu buvais.
Tu détestais tant être policier que tu faisais tout ce que tu pouvais pour m’empêcher
de me tourner vers les forces de l’ordre.
Quand je suis entré au FBI, tu n’as jamais appelé.
Jamais de félicitations.
Trop occupé à être jaloux de ton propre fils.
OK. Je suis officiellement en train de me parler à moi-même maintenant.
Tu te sens mieux ?
Allez, Tommy, tu es adulte.
Je n’imaginais pas que tu gardais autant de haine envers moi.
Etre père, tu sais à quel point c’est compliqué.
Regarde toi et Kyle. Le gamin est en prison.
Il ne te parle même pas, ne te laisse pas le voir.
Kyle a besoin de temps, et je lui donne.
Ca s’appelle du respect.
J’ai toujours été là pour lui, dans les bons moments comme dans les mauvais.
Je n’ai pas appris ça de toi.
Je sais que je n’ai pas été un bon père.
J’essayais d’être là pour toi et pour Susan.
Cherche un autre endroit où aller.
En fait, pourquoi ne nous rends-tu pas service à tous les 2 en partant d’ici ?
Ca ne va pas arriver.
Bien. Alors je le ferai.
Tu ne peux pas fuir, mon pote.
Ca ne va pas être facile de se débarasser de moi.
Si tu ne veux pas partir, je te ferai partir.
Je vais trouver le 4400 qui me fait ça, et je vais le forcer à arrêter ça.
Tu retournes sur l’affaire ?
Je viens avec toi.
Non, non.
Je ne vais pas enquêter avec mon père mort.
Je ne pense pas que tu aies beaucoup le choix, Tom.
Soit je suis du voyage...
ou alors toi et moi nous retournons à l’intérieur pour parler un peu plus.
Bien.
Juste ne te montre pas quand je suis au milieu d’une conversation avec quelqu’un, OK?
Pas de problème.
Ca fait longtemps que je n’ai pas travaillé sur une affaire.
Ca va être amusant.
Tu fais toujours ces boules de glace Ben & Jerry tardives, hein ?
Josh, je veux que tu partes.
Arrête d’apparaître dans ma vie.
Tu sais, c’est marrant,
mais tu ne te prépares de la glace que lorsque tout le monde est au lit.
Je me suis toujours demandé ce que ça signifiait.
Tu sais, tu vas bien être obligée de me parler.
Non.
Tu vois, tu es une hallucination,
donc j’ai juste à faire un choix conscient pour t’ignorer,
et tu finiras par disparaître.
C’est un bon plan.
Je pense juste que ça ne va pas marcher.
Tu vois, il y a une raison à ma présence, Diana. Il doit y en avoir une.
Tu es un hasard, juste un hoquet mental.
Josh Sandler n’est même pas mort.
Je lui ai parlé ce soir.
Il enseigne l’astronomie au Lycée Pomona.
Et alors ? C’est le Josh Sandler d’aujourd’hui.
Tes problèmes, tu les as avec moi, le type avec qui tu étais fiancée.
Je n’ai aucun problème !
Maman ?
Tu vas bien ?
J’ai entendu des bruits.
Je vais bien, ma chérie.
J’étais juste... en train de préparer quelque chose pour le travail.
Allez.
Au lit.
Tu étais fiancée ?
Pourquoi est-ce que tout le monde a autant de mal à le croire ?
Eh bien, ce n’est pas difficile à croire.
C’est juste... eh bien, tu ne me l’as jamais dit.
C’était il y a longtemps.
Ca n’a pas marché.
Ecoute, je suis heureux que tu aies appelé.
Je n’aime pas l’idée d’avoir une substance dans mon corps qui est à l’origine de 3 suicides.
Ces hallucinations que nous avons,
jusqu’ici, ça ne ressemble pas à ce qu’Erika Lundgren a traversé.
Tout ce que mon père veut, c’est parler.
Je sais. Josh ne m’a pas menacé non plus.
Tant que ça reste ainsi,
il n’y a pas de raison que nous n’utilisions pas notre temps libre pour s’occuper de cette affaire.
Il y a ce service de livraisons.
Si nous pouvons tracer la piste de ces cookies,
peut-être que nous pouvons trouver le 4400 qui est derrière tout ça.
Et il y a le Cowen Park.
Ce dealer ne sait pas que quelqu’un le cherche.
Je prends le parc, tu prends le service de livraisons.
Ca semble une bonne idée.
Tout mais attendre que mon ex se montre...
Devon, tous ces messages sont de ce matin ?
Oui, eh bien, tout le monde veut te féliciter pour tes fiancailles.
Tu ne veux pas te retourner ?
Non, je ne veux parler à personne.
Même pas à ta mère ? Je l’ai là.
Si. Merci, Devon.
Maman. Salut.
Non.
Maman.
Maman, qui t’a dit que je me suis fiancé ?
Non. Je viens.
Maman, où es-tu ?
Il était un peu coquin, non ?
Si mignon.
Regardez-moi ces yeux.
Regardez ce petit derrière !
Quelqu’un me dit ce qu’il se passe ici ?
Voici M. Secret.
Je montre juste tes photos de bébé à ta fiancée.
Considère que c’est la punition pour ne pas m’avoir prévenu la première.
Viens, assieds-toi.
J’aimerais, mais en fait Isabelle et moi devons partir.
Nous avons beaucoup de choses à nous dire.
Tu m’étonnes.
Mon ainé se marie, et je vais aider aux préparatifs.
Je promets que nous ne prendrons aucune décision sans toi,
mais Isabelle, nous devons y aller maintenant.
Shawn, tu es impoli.
Je ne veux pas l’être, mais nous devons vraiment y aller.
Maintenant.
C’était vraiment bon de vous revoir.
Vous aussi.
J’aime énormément votre fils.
Nous devrions probablement aller dans l’autre direction.
Super. Tu es de retour.
Nous allons à Covington, non ?
Tu ne devrais pas t’asseoir à l’arrière, Josh.
Tu sais, ça a toujours été une de tes qualités les moins flatteuses.
Pourriez-vous parler un peu plus fort, madame? Je n’ai pas compris.
Je ne vous parlais pas.
J’étais juste...
Désolé.
Je ne voulais pas être ennuyeux.
En fait, je suis désolé pour tout
la manière don’t les choses se sont passées entre nous
Je devais te le dire.
Pas d'excuses. Peux-tu juste te taire?
Tu sais je dois reconnaître
que ce n’est pas comme ça que je t’imaginais.
Le fait de travailler pour le gouvernement, de porter une arme,
ce qui s’est passé entre nous, le mariage…
ça a vraiment du te changer.
Comme d’habitude, Josh, tu te places au centre de tout.
Peut-être que j’ai changé, mais ça n’a rien à voir avec toi.
En fait, jusqu’à hier soir, moment où tu es réapparu,
je n’avais pas pensé à toi depuis……cinq ans.
Quoi?
C’est juste que ton oeil gauche a toujours ce petit tic quand tu mens.
Oui. Je me souviens de vous. Le panier garni.
Oui. Il y avait des cookies dedans
et nous avons des raisons de croire qu’une drogue y a été ajoutée.
Je ne sais rien à ce sujet.
Je ne fais que récupérer des paquets et les livrer.
Vous me les avez livrer.
Où les avez-vous récupérer?
C’est censé être confidentiel.
Je pense que ça ira pour cette fois.
C’était un vieux bâtiment en centre ville.
Le voilà. 156 Liberty Avenue
Regardes ces gens.
Ils n’essaient même pas de se cacher de ce qu’ils font.
Je te dis que les choses ont changé depuis que j’ai fini mes rondes.
Ouais. Je sais.
Tu aurais gagné la guerre de la drogue d’une seule main.
Tu es devenu un homme très coléreux, tu le sais.
Je ne suis pas en train d’essayer de déclencher une bataille,
je sais que je ne suis pas parfait.
Tu n’es même pas vivant.
D’accord. C’est juste.
Je n’étais pas parfait.
J’en tiens rigueur à ce job.
Tu te brûles à force de jouer avec cette merde.
De le violence, de la laideur…
c’est entré dans ma tête…
Je ne pouvais plus m’en séparer, même une fois rentré.
C’est pour ça que je me suis mis à boire.
C’est pour quoi je suis devenu méchant avec toi et avec ta mère.
Je ne me cherche pas d’excuses.
Tu sembles avoir besoin de quelques explications pour comprendre ce que j’ai fait.
C’est ce que je peux te dire de mieux.
OK.
Ce n’est pas quelque chose que j’ignorais mais …… OK.
A propos du dealer que nous recherchons?
Tu ne m’as pas dit qu’il portait une veste du style première catégorie au lycée?
Oui, pourquoi?
Je ne sais pas à quoi tu te prépares.
Tu ne trouveras rien.
Ca  ne serait pas de la blink, par hasard?
Et si ça en était ?
La "blink" est la grande nouveauté.
Les fédéraux n’ont pas encore eut le temps de le faire passer en tant que substance illicite.
Ouais, nous trouverons le temps.
C’est ce que nous faisons lorsque les gens commencent à mourir.
Et qui tu supplies avec ça?
Tu penses que je te le dirai?
Baldwin.
Est-ce que Jarvis a dit à propos de quoi c’était ?
Non, juste qu’il y avait de nouvelles pistes sur l’enquête.
Ce sont les agents qui étaient affectés?
Voici Tom Baldwin et Diana Skouris.
Hier, ils étaient compromis.
Je suis désolé pour tout ça.
Vous avez été drogué contre votre volonté
et ces jeunes gens qui se suicident…
c’est si terrible.
Euh, madame, qui êtes-vous?
Mon nom est Naomi Bonderman.
C’est mon talent qui vous a fait ça.
Je suis la cause de tout ça.
Un jour il y a 3 mois,
je me suis réveillé avec ce qui m’a semblé être des paumes moîtes.
Ensuite, j’ai compris que ce n’était pas de la transpiration.
C’était comme…
de l’huile, je suppose que vous lui donnez ce nom.
Et c’est à ce moment là que j’ai vu ma sœur pour la première fois.
Votre sœur, vous ne l’aviez pas vu depuis longtemps?
Ruth est morte depuis 30 ans.
Et pourtant elle était là, debout au pied de mon lit.
Nous n’avons jamais été très proche.
Et une fois que j’ai compris que je n’étais pas complètement timbrée
nous avons passé une visite très sympa.
Finalement, après tant d’années
nous avons arrangé les choses entre nous.
Au matin, elle était partie.
Ensuite, j’ai touché la main de Gordon.
Gordon? Votre mari?
Non, mon facteur.
Cette nuit là, il avait eu la visite de quelques anciens camarades blessés lors de la première guerre du golfe.
C’est à partir de ce moment-là que j’ai commence à porter des gants.
Mrs. Bonderman, savez-vous comment votre talent est venu à être vendu dans les rues?
Au début, je n’en avais aucune idée…
mais maintenant je pense qu’il y a un lien avec mon poulet frit.
J’utilise beaucoup d’herbes
quand je cuisine.
Je les fais pousser moi-même.
C’est le seul endroit où
je ne porte pas mes gants,
quand je travaille dans le jardin.
Et les herbes ont absorbé
l’huile de vos mains.
Ma famille était venue
pour un repas dominicale,
et cette nuit là, ils ont tous commencé
à avoir leur propres visiteurs.
Ça été très éprouvant
pour tout le monde,
mais ça a semblé se régler au mieux.
Personne n’ait mort ou
quelque chose comme ça.
Est-ce que quelqu’un aurait
pu se procurer ces herbes,
les utiliser pour faire cette drogue ?
Bien, c’est ce qui a dû arriver.
Le mardi après le dîner,
je suis sortie pour arroser,
et toutes mes plantes avaient disparu.
Arrachées.
Quelqu’un a volé les herbes
de votre jardin...
Quelqu’un qui connaissait
l’effet qu’elles pouvaient avoir.
J’avais espoir que mon habilité pourrait un jour
être utilisée comme une sorte de thérapie,
pour aider les gens,
mais maintenant on la vend
dans les rues et des gens meurent.
C’est juste horrible.
Mme Bonderman, savez-vous combien de
temps ces visions durent habituellement ?
Quelques fois les visiteurs restent
pendant des jours, des semaines parfois.
Je sais une chose ceci dit.
Plus vous les ignorez, plus ils restent
et plus ils deviennent insistants.
Je sais que nous sommes
officiellement en congé maladie,
mais je pensais vérifier cette adresse
qu’on a eu de la compagnie de livraison,
essayer de trouver qui a envoyé ces cookies.
Tu veux venir ?
En fait, je pensais me
rendre chez Mme Bonderman,
vérifier la liste des invités
de ce dîner une fois de plus.
Elle semble un peu vague
à propos des personnes présentes.
Tu penses que l’un d’entre eux pourrait avoir
monté une affaire avec la recette de grand-mère ?
Ça vaut le coup de vérifier.
Isabelle, ça doit cesser.
Tu ne peux pas me forcer à t’épouser.
Tu as peur de t’engager.
J’ai lu ça quelque part.
Non, ce n’est pas la peur de l’engagement.
Je veux que tu comprennes
que cela ne va pas arriver.
Je ne vais pas t’épouser,
et si tu ne peux pas accepter ça,
si tu veux me faire du mal
pour t’avoir rejeté,
vas-y, fais-le.
Je suis juste là.
Finissons-en.
Je ne te ferai jamais de mal, Shawn.
C’est bon à entendre.
Ok, on est d’accord, hein ?
C’est fini entre nous ?
Tu m’as dit un jour qu’il fallait
choisir entre le bien ou le mal,
un choix que tu avais dû faire.
Bien, en ce moment,
je me trouve devant ce choix,
et j’ai peur que si je te perds,
je vais faire le mauvais choix.
Qui vas-tu menacer cette fois ?
Ma mère ?
Shawn, je ne menace personne.
- Je te demande ton aide.
- Mon aide ?
J’ai été envoyé ici pour faire des choses,
des choses brutales.
Ta mère et des millions d’autres gens
pourraient mourir à cause de moi.
Je ne sais pas comment tu peux savoir ça,
mais ça n’a pas à se passer comme ça.
Tu peux le combattre.
C’est ce que j’essaye de faire.
C’est pour ça que toi et moi,
on a besoin d’être ensembles,
parce que je pense que tu es
le seul qui puisse m’arrêter.
Vous êtes sûr que c’est le bon endroit ?
Ouai. J’étais juste ici.
Le type est venu de derrière,
m’a donné les cookies, c’est tout.
Le propriétaire a dit que ce local
était vide depuis huit mois.
Vous avez dit que ces gars
étaient des dealers, n’est-ce pas ?
Je veux dire, peut être
qu’ils déménagent souvent.
Peut être qu’ils opèrent
dans un tas d’endroits différents.
Et l’homme qui vous a donné les cookies,
vous ne vous souvenez de rien sur lui ?
Je ne prêtais pas vraiment attention.
Si je le revoyais, peut être...
Écoutez, comme personne n’est là,
est-ce que je peux y aller ?
Je dois retourner travailler.
Oui, bien sûr.
Merci d’avoir essayé.
Appelez-moi si quelque chose vous revient.
Bien sûr.
Est-ce que c’est un indice ?
J’essaye de travailler là.
Tu sais quoi, pour moi
non plus ce n’est pas marrant.
J’ai un boulot, aussi.
Il doit y avoir quelque chose que tu
veux me dire, parler du bon vieux temps…
Du bon vieux temps ?
Tu m’as trompé, deux semaines
avant notre mariage.
Qui fait des choses comme ça ?
Je pensais bien que tu serais toujours
en colère à propos de ça.
Ça m’a pris un temps fou pour
surmonter ce que tu m’avais fait.
La douleur, la trahison…
Mais je l’ai fait.
Je t’ai mis derrière moi,
j’ai été de l’avant,
Je ne suis pas intéressée par une seule
des choses que tu aurais à me dire.
Josh ?
On a fini ?
N’importe qui aurait pu passer
par dessus cette barrière.
Merci de le faire remarquer.
Tu te souviens quand tu étais enfant,
tu m’aidais à tondre la pelouse ?
Je me souviens de toi me criant
dessus pour avoir mal tondu.
Je voulais que tu fasses du bon boulot,
que tu sois fiers de ton travail,
que tu sois un homme.
Oui, bien, ça a marché.
Quelque soit la situation,
Je pense à ce que tu aurais fait,
et je fais le contraire.
Ça n’a jamais raté.
Ça c’est bien mon Tommy.
Il a toutes les réponses, hein?
Quand ça te concerne, oui.
Très bien, alors, réponds moi.
La dernière fois que j’étais à l’hôpital,
la fois où je n’en suis pas sorti,
pourquoi tu n’es pas venu me voir ?
C’est une question simple, Tom.
Agent Baldwin ?
Voudriez-vous du thé glacé ?
Voyons, il y a avait Barry,
Kathleen, et les jumeaux…
Oh, ils ont pleuré pendant tout le dîner…
Philip et sa nouvelle petite amie.
J’ai peur de ne pas me souvenir de son nom.
Heu, Roger et Julie.
Je suis désolée, Julie
était malade ce jour là.
Une migraine. Elle en a tout le temps.
C’est mon petit fils, Randy.
Il travaille pour la société
“ Livraisons portes à portes ” ?
Il se cherche toujours…
Est-ce qu’il sait pour votre habilité ?
Oh, bien sûr qu’il sait.
Il était là pour le dîner.
Il a pris deux portions de poulet.
Le voisin a dit que Randy était
parti il y a quelques heures.
Aucune idée où il a pu aller.
On sait qu’il n’est pas à son travail.
Je vais vérifier la chambre,
voir si je peux trouver un carnet d’adresse.
Vous ne vous arrêtez même pas pour manger ?
Je pensais m’être débarrassé de toi.
Non, non, on a encore
quelques points à éclaircir.
Tu sais cette chose que tu as dite
à propos de comment tu es allée de l’avant,
que tu m’as mis derrière toi ?
Je ne suis pas sûr de te croire.
Je m’en fou.
Bien, peut être pas.
Mais si tu m’as vraiment oublié,
comment ça se fait que tu n’as pas eu
une seule relation sérieuse depuis qu’on a rompu ?
j’ai eu plein de relations sérieuses,
bien plus respectueuses et réussies
que celle que j’ai eu avec toi.
Tu veux en citer une ?
Qu’est-ce que tu fais de Marco ?
Je dirai que c’est un type adorable
qui ferait n’importe quoi pour toi.
Tu pourrais apprendre de lui.
Cela étant dit, c’est une relation
sans futur, et tu le sais.
C’est pour ça que tu es avec lui.
Je n’ai aucune idée de
l’avenir que j’ai avec Marco.
On ne sort pas ensemble depuis longtemps.
Vous serez ensemble pendant quelques mois,
et quand il te poussera à t’engager,
tu lui diras finalement la vérité,
qu’il n’y a aucune alchimie,
que vous n’allez pas ensemble…
Toutes ces choses que tu sais déjà.
Est-ce que c’est vraiment comme ça
que je traite les hommes avec qui je sors ?
Di…
Tu es une fille formidable,
et j’ai tout gâché.
Ce que je t’ai fait était cruel,
mais tu ne peux pas te
protéger pour toujours.
Ce n’est pas juste pour toi,
et ce n’est pas juste pour Marco.
Là tout de suite, je dirai que quelqu’un
a fait un peu de pâtisserie.
Oui, mais où sont passés
tous les cookies ?
Écoutes, petit, je sais que tu es occupé,
mais tu ne réponds jamais à mes questions.
Pourquoi n’es-tu pas venu me voir
quand je mourrai ?
Papa, je ne peux vraiment
pas parler de ça maintenant.
Hey, c’est pas mon souvenir préféré non plus.
Alors finissons-en avec ça.
Et je te laisserai tranquille.
Tu veux dire que si je te le dis,
c’est fini ?
On a fini, tu partiras ?
Ça serait un pas dans la bonne direction.
J’étais à Baltimore, je travaillais
sur une affaire pour le bureau.
Quand j’ai eu l’appel de maman,
j’ai acheté un billet d’avion pour la maison.
J’étais prêt à partir, mais l’affaire
s’est emballée et j’ai raté mon avion.
Le temps que j’en attrape un autre,
c’était trop tard.
Je t’ai demandé la vérité, Tommy.
Tu me donnes juste des excuses.
Tu veux la vérité ?
Je suis resté loin
pour te faire une faveur.
Tu ne me voulais pas là bas, papa.
Quoi que j’aurai pu dire,
quoi que j’aurai pu faire,
ça t’aurait juste énervé, comme toujours.
J’ai pensé que mon absence rendrait
les choses plus faciles pour toi.
Je t’ai laissé mourir en paix.
Je voulais te voir une dernière fois.
Tu es mon fils, Tommy.
Je t’aime.
Bien, c’est bon à entendre,
mais c’est un peu tard.
Je sais.
C’était ma faute.
Je suis désolé.
Mais je te voulais avec moi, Tommy.
Tu avais tort à propos de moi,
de ce que je ressentais.
Peut être que tu as tort
sur d’autres choses.
J’espère que tu vas me montrer
une cuisine remplie de cookies.
J’aimerai bien.
Je pense qu’il les a pris avec lui.
Tu devrais jeter un œil là dessus.
Je l’ai trouvé coincé derrière le buffet.
On dirait qu'il a gardé un registre de toutes les personnes qu'il a « dosé ».
Tu penses que c'est une sorte de liste d'ennemis ? IL essaye de se venger de toutes ces personnes ?
Diana...
C'est la foire gastronomique. Ca commence aujourd'hui
Maintenant nous savons où il a pris les gâteaux.
Tom...
Arrête !
Lève toi.
Où sont les autres gâteaux ?
Il n'y en a plus, je le jure.
Il vient juste d'ouvrir la boîte. On dirait que nous sommes arrivés juste à temps.
Bon travail, vous deux.
Les médecins du Ntac vont être occupés un bout de temps.
Oui, on va les garder en observation. Rassemblez-les.
Je suppose que vous avez été trop occupé à ignorer vos congés médicaux pour vous occuper de vos propres situations.
Nous avons commencé par le début.
Ouais, si mon père se montre, je vais passer beaucoup de temps au travail, moi aussi.
Mais maintenant, je veux que vous rentriez tout les deux à la maison et que vous vous occupiez de ça.
Si vous pensez que vous ne pouvez pas y arriver,
on vous prendra des suites communiquantes à l'hopital du ntac.
Ok ?
Je veux juste que vous sachiez que je n'ai jamais voulu blesser qui que ce soit.
Et bien, dis ça à Erika Lundgren et aux autres qui sont morts.
Je suis vraiment désolé à propos de ça.
Vraiment.
Mais tout ce que j'ai fait c'est leur donner une chance de gérer leurs propres problèmes.
Vous savez, face à face.
Je voulais juste partager cet éclaircissement.
Je suppose qu'ils ne pouvaient pas gérer ça.
Et bien, je ne vois pas le rapport. Pourquoi nous envoyer les gâteaux à nous ?
De quoi parles-tu ?
Les gars, vous avez mis à jour le scandal de la Promicin.
Vous avez sauvé la vie de ma grand-mère.
C'était un cadeau, ma manière de vous remercier.
« Merci » ?
Je suppose qu'aucune bonne action ne reste impunie, hein ?
Tous ces trucs qu'Isabelle t'a dit,
tu es sûr qu'elle ne l'a pas inventé, pour t'effrayer et essayer de te garder auprès d'elle ?
Parce que je te dis, Shawn,
ça a l'air fou.
Je peux guérir les gens. Tu peux faire bouger des choses avec ton esprit.
On vit dans un monde de dingues.
Quand elle était bébé,
même plus tôt, quand elle était dans le ventre de sa mère,
j'ai su qu'elle était différente, dangeureuse.
Richard, si je croyais que rester avec Isabelle pour sauver toutes ces vies,
je l'épouserais dès demain.
Mais que va-t-il se passer d'ici un mois ou un an ?
Que se passera-t-il si elle fini par s'ennuyer de moi ou si je la mets en colère ?
Je comprends. L'épouser n'est pas la solution.
Il faut qu'on trouve un autre moyen pour l'arrêter.
Elle est ma fille, Shawn.
Qu'est-ce que tu me ferais faire ?
Hé, j'étais dehors avec certains des gars.
J'ai rappliqué dès que j'ai eu ton message.
Ca va ?
Je suis passé chez un italien en venant.
Ne soit pas gentil avec moi.
Euh, je n'aime pas ça.
Je sais que ce n'est pas agréable, mais tu fais ce qui est juste.
Ca veut dire qu'on peut se dire aurevoir ?
En fait, oui.
Essaye de ne pas me rater, Di.
Ce ne sera pas le cas.
Aurevoir ? Tu veux dire que tu pars ?
Tout ce que j'ai fait c'est te rendre malheureux.
Je pense en avoir assez fait quand tu étais enfant.
Ouais, on s'arrête là.
On a fait à peu près tous les progrès que nous pouvions faire, hein ?
Prends soin de toi.
Je te serrerais bien la main, mais ça ne marche pas ainsi.
Papa ?
Tu sais ce que j'ai dit, que j'avais raté cet avion pour te faire une faveur ?
Ce n'était pas vrai.
Je ne l'ai jamais pensé.
Je l'ai fait pour moi.
C'était cette idée de rester dans une chambre d'hôpital à te regarder mourir...
avec toute cette colère entre nous,
en sachant que nous ne nous réconcilierons jamais,
que nous...
nous ne serions jamais aussi proche que je l'aurais voulu. Je ne pouvais pas.
Ca va, Tommy. Je...
Je ne méritais pas de t'avoir là-bas.
J'aurais néanmoins dû être là. Je suis désolé.
C'est le temps qui nous a rattrapé, hein ?
Et bien, je suppose qu'il n'y a plus d'horloge maintenant, n'est-ce pas ?
J'ai tout le temps nécessaire,
mais nous ne sommes pas obligés de l'utiliser
Pourquoi ne viens-tu pas t'asseoir ?
Tommy, nous ne sommes pas obligés de faire ça.
Je sais. Pourquoi est-ce que tu, euh...
Pourquoi est-ce que tu ne retournes pas dans la cuisine, hein ?
Je n'ai jamais aimé manger seul.
Rien de pire.
Donc... de quoi voulais-tu parler ?
Content ?
Tu as essayé.
Ca n'a pas marché..
Je suppose que nous allons nous marier, finalement.
Tu ne peux pas me tuer, Shawn.
Je suppose que nous allons nous marier, finalement.

* I'm in heaven... *
Ethan, I don't think
it's going to clear up anytime soon.
I don't think it's
going to last that long.
It's not raining that hard.
It was so nice this morning.
Yeah. It'll clear up.
And if it doesn't, we'll just
have a picnic in the car.
No, Daddy. I want
to go outside and play.
Oh, no, you're going
to get all wet, sweetie.
Maybe later.
Please?
It's a very light shower.
Please? I won't get wet.
Please?
Okay.
Yay!
But just for a minute.
Okay.
And I want you to come right back.
I promise.
Have fun.
I will.
We treated you as an equal.
That wasn't good enough for you.
You had to cross the line.
I'd put in for a transfer
if I were you.
So, where you two going
for dinner?
Chez Michael's.
That's going to set you back.
Elizabeth has been married
to me for 35 years.
She deserves a nice meal.
Have a good evening,
Orson.
God bless.
Oh, you need to slow down, cousin.
I'm not driving back into town
for another six pack.
You're just afraid my dad
will kick your ass
if I come home smelling like beer.
Evil cousin Shawn-- that's me.
Corrupter of the innocent.
That next door neighbor
of yours, what's-her-name?
She seems ready
for some corruption.
You mean Nikki?
She's 14, Kyle.
14?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Now, would it be fair to say
that this comet is close in size
to Haley's comet,
or is it a little bigger?
Well, actually, as far as comets go,
this one's a little smaller
than Haley's,
but what makes this
particularly interesting to us
is how close it will pass by Earth.
And what are the predictions
on how close it will pass?
Hey, kiddo.
WOMAN:
Somewhere between two
and five million miles.
You're missing the show.
There's a big comet.
WOMAN:
...the distance from the sun
to the Earth
is about 93 million miles...
NASA says we'll never see one
closer in our lifetime.
Yeah, I didn't think
that would work.
MAN:
...appears to have
little or no tail.
WOMAN:
Well, it's a little unusual...
Hi.
How is he?
The same.
Same as always.
Some of your mail's
still coming to the house.
I'll call the post office.
Hi, baby.
Haven't seen you around here
for the last couple of days.
Can't make it every
day, not anymore.
Not after
three years.
So what are we supposed to do,
just give up on him?
I better go.
Linda, just wait.
Linda!
Linda.
It's not a competition, Tom.
It's not about who can sit by
his side the longest.
I still love him.
I just can't live here
like you do.
I know.
I wasn't accusing you.
I saw you got a bill
from Olympia Investigations.
More pvate detectives?
I thought we were
on to something.
Someone matching
Shawn's description
living down in Monterey.
But it wasn't him, was it?
Shawn can be anywhere.
Even if you found him
it wouldn't wake Kyle up.
At least I'd have some answers.
I'm worried about you, Tom.
Finding Shawn and figuring out
what happened to our son,
that is my job.
How can you not know that?
You look tired.
Try and get some rest.
I thought we were supposed
to be watching the comet.
Oh, yeah, the comet.
Is it supposed to
be that bright?
Skouris here.
Get over here. Now.
This cannot be good.
All right, listen up, everyone.
We're at DEFCON One.
These envelopes
are orders from Home Sec.
Our first priority is
secure SeaTac Airport,
ground all the planes,
gaer up all the foreign dignitaries
in the greater metropolitan area.
Get them, the local
elected officials,
take them all to the
shelters in those orders.
Someone bring me up
to speed. Sid?
The comet.
It's not a fly-by anymore.
It's heading right at us.
Sir, it just changed course
and accelerated again.
A comet cannot change course.
This one has.
Then it's not a cot.
Revised estimate
of velocity is...
3,000 kilometers a second.
How much time do we have?
Impact in 28 minutes.
Sir.
Ryland.
Understood.
China just launched
its missiles at it.
Get ready, guys.
We're going next.
There has been a launch.
The U.S.ilitary
has launched a volley
of 24 Titan II missiles.
Danny...
what's going on?
All right.
Our missiles are in the air.
England has launched, too.
France and Russia.
NORAD's saying
the first flight of missiles
will intercept in 15 seconds.
Nine...
eight...
seven...
six...
five... four...
Three... two...
one.
We should get inside.
Multiple hits.
I think they got it.
NORAD is reporting that at least
nine of the Titan II missiles
have hit their target.
It appears the comet has...
No effect. The comet
is still headed right for us.
How hard will it hit?
Something that big, that fast?
You don't want to know.
You don't want to know.
I'm scared.
I'm going to go find
my parents, okay?
Okay
Hey, Dad?
If you're there can you pick up
the phone?
It's Diana.
You know, your daughter.
Ju tell my brother that I love him.
You tell Mommy that I love her,
okay?
Nancy, it's dad.
I just wanted to tell you
I love you.
Catastrophic impact with Earth
now appears unavoidable...
Tom,t's Susan. What is going on?
...Where and exactly when
this now certain...
Tom, isn't there a shelter
we can go to?
I mean, technically you still
work for Homeland Security,
don't you?
Susan, it doesn't matter.
The shelters aren't going to
make a damn bit of difference.
Just...
I'm sorry. I love you, sis.
Just hug Danny close
and pray for the best.
Sir, British missiles
just hit the object
but it's still coming.
It's entered the atmosphere.
I got it on SeaTac radar.
It's slowing down.
What?
It's at Mach Seven, Mach Two.
It's going subsonic.
It's leveling off
and continuing to lose speed.
It's as if it's coming in
for a landing.
Landing? Wha... like...
Like a pla?
No, more like the mothership.
Give me some coordinates.
Where's it going?
47 North Longitude;
122, maybe 123 West Latitude.
That's by Mount Rainier.
That's our backyard.
Come on, get the shot.
Get the sh.
We're, we're close to the base
of Mount Rainier.
The ball of light is massive;
100, 200 feet in diameter.
It's hard to tell.
We're going to try to get closer.
I can tell you that this is,
without a doubt, one of the most
incredible sights I've ever seen.
We're still looking
for some sort of official
that might be here
from the government.
Jim?
Jim, what's going on?
We're not sure what's just happened.
The ball of light is gone.
Thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.
This is amazing.
There are thousands of people
as far as the eye can see.
I think I just...
I saw your brother.
Shawn?
Yeah!
Pull me all the files
from the Northern Counties.
I want back in.
Tom, do you have any idea
what I'm wading through here?
I have over 4,000 people
that stepped out
of a ball of light
and landed in my lap.
Somef them have been gone 60 years.
None of them have any memory
of what happened to them.
You want me to drop everything
because u want back in?
I can help.
I needed help from you before.
When Home Sec asked me
who I wanted
to bring over from the Bureau,
your name
was at the top of the list.
What did I get from you?
Five months.
Five months.
And then an indefinite leave
absence.
You made fools out of both of us.
I needed to find the truth
about what happened toy son.
And you still do.
And that's the reason
you want back in...
because your nephew
is one of the returnees.
Look, I admit
I have a personal stake in this.
That's why I'll come through
for you.
I need answers, too.
Diana Skouris.
Tom Baldwin.
You two will be one
of the teams
that's responsible
for investiging
what happened to the returnees.
Skouris, ex-CDC, right?
Yeah, I heard of you, too.
You got to be
kidding me, right?
Is there a problem?
He went MIA once.
Who's to say
he won't do it again?
Me.
Is this where you give me
the "Be a good soldier" speech?
No, this is ere
I give you the speech
about how you're
my best field scientist
and Tom is my best
lead investigator,
and how together,
you're going to make a good team.
Hmm.
Well, should be interesting.
Nice to meet you, too.
Beautiful.
The sooner we find out
what's going on,
the better for us.
The better for them.
What's your name again, sir?
Julius.
Anita.
Amanda.
I want to see my family.
( speaks Spanish )
( speaks German )
Orson Bailey.
It's not possible.
Why? It's 1979.
So for them, no timeas passed.
Last night was our anniversary.
So between you and me,
what do you think
happened to them?
Where do you think they've been?
I don't know.
There had to be some kind
of ielligence behind it.
As in the hand of God
or little green men?
I'm not discounting anything.
Here, look.
This is an interesting one.
They're dead, aren't they?
This is Maia Rutledge.
She was the first one to disappear
as far as we can tell.
She's eight years old,
only she was born in 1938.
I'll be okay, mostly.
She's a tough little kid.
Look,
there's one returnee
I'd like to interview myself.
Yeah, so I've been told.
Returnee 2,117--
Shawn Farrell.
He's all yours.
All we're asking for is access.
These people deserve
to see their families.
To receive legal representation.
They're private citizens
who've done nothing wrong.
We don't know that.
It's been less than a week.
For all we know, these people
could be walking time bombs,
disease vectors, spies.
Sent by who?
She doesn't like us much.
We've just seen thousands of...
The feeling's mutual.
The government won't tell us
anything about it.
I believe a little
paranoia is warranted
and I believe that
the majority of the American
public agrees with me.
Well, fortunately, the American
public has been know to disagree.
The Secretary of State is colored?
You mean black.
I'll take your word for it.
The National Security
Advisor, too.
Boy, the world sure
has changed since '51.
You should try to relax, son.
You're not going to get out
of here any quicker
by wearing a groove in the floor.
Are you some kind
of jailhouse philosopher?
Barracks philosopher, actually.
Oh...
I was a combat pilot in Korea.
Nice tattoo.
Who's Lily?
A girl I ud to know.
Shawn Farrell, report
to interview room one.
I'll see you.
Medical exams for group F returnees
have been delayed by one hour...
What's your name again, sir?
Orson Bailey.
I want to speak
to someone in charge.
I mean, why can't I
just make a call?
Uncle Tommy, hi.
It's good to see you.
Look, what's going on?
Nobody will tell us anything.
We'll let you know
as soon as we find out.
I still can't believe it's you.
How do you think I feel?
Listen, do you know how long
they'rgoing to keep us,
because I really want
to go home.
Shawn,
do you remember anything?
Anything at all about what
happened that night?
Nothing.
Nothing.
One minute I'm sitting there
with Kyle on the beach.
The next it's three years later
and I'm standing next
to some mountain
with a couple thousand
strangers around me.
Listen, Uncle Tommy,
some people are saying
that we were abducted by aliens.
We can't rule anything out yet.
Well, can you give me anying?
How's my mom? How's Danny?
Fine, they're all fine.
They miss you.
Great.
Hey, what about Kyle?
I mean, he mushave seen
something the night
that I disappeared.
Did he tell you anything?
He hasn't said a word.
He's okay, isn't he?
Isn't he?
Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.
What are you talking about?
What I'm talking about
is Kyle lying on a bed
with a ventilator down his throat
being fed through one tube
and pissing out another.
He's been like that ever since
the night you left.
He was fine last time I saw him.
We were having
a couple of beers.
Look, don't you lie to me, Shawn.
I'm no
Don't u lie to me!
I've been waiting
three years
to hear the truth from you,
so please don't lie to me.
I just told you the truth.
Is that what you've been
thinking this whole time?
That I gave Kyle something
that messed him up
and that I just took off?
Screw you, Uncle Tommy.
I just told you everything I know.
Goddamn it!
You look
as bored as I feel.
I wish there were windows
in this place.
I'd like to see the stars,
wouldn't you?
Do I look that bad?
No, it's just you
remind me of someone
I used to know.
How long you've been gone?
Since '51.
It wouldn't be me, then.
'93.
I'm Richard.
Lily.
My friend, her name
was Lily, too.
Lily Bonham.
That's my grandmother's name.
Lily Bonham from Saint Louis?
You knew my grandmother.
Is she still alive?
I'm sorry.
She died before I was born.
Are you all right?
Lily's dead and I'm sitting
here with her granddaughter.
It doesn't make any sense.
No goddamn sense at all.
I know how you feel.
I keep thinking I'm going
to wake up from this dream
and tell my husband
all about it.
You have... you have a family?
Yeah.
Brian and I
and our daughter, Heidi.
She was six months when I...
So, what was she like,
my grandmother?
Oh...
Everyone says I look
a lot like her.
They were right.
I'm sorry, that's not
possible right now.
Th is ridiculous.
You have no right  hold us
here like this.
We haven't done anything wrong.
I'm sorry.
This is for you.
Well, the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals upheld a lawsuit
by the ACLU on behalf
of the families.
We don't have a legal right
to hold them.
Okay, but some of these people
have no place to go,
no familieleft.
The word is,gypt and China
are refusing
to repatriate its citizens.
India's on the fence.
Oh, wait a minute.
We're not kicking anybody out.
Whoever wants to stay can stay.
As far as American citizens,
whoever leaves will get whatever
assistance is required to get
their life back on track:
Medicare, unemployment,
rent vouchers,
vocational training.
Vocational training?
We need to isolate these people.
They're not virus samples,
they're human beings.
The order's been given.
We're letting them go.
I wouldn't book
your vacations just ye
Each Regional Homeland
Security Office
will be responsible
for the returnees
who settle in their region.
So, we'll be monitoring
79 people,
plus another 135 have chosen
to remain in quarantine
for the time being.
Each of our returnees
will check in once a week.
Any difficulties faced
by the rurnees in our district
will be handled by this office.
nally, we'll continue
with our ongoing investigation.
We'll all sleep better
once we know
what the hell's going on.
Thank you.
You look so lonely standing
there without an ID number.
I'm supposed to be 82 years old.
There's no one here
waiting for me.
So what are you going to
do now that you're out?
Head back to the old
neighborhood, I suppose.
What about you?
No, wait, let me guess.
Take your daughter
to Woodland Park.
We used to love that place.
Of course, Heidi was barely
crawling then and now she's 12.
Uh...
You've been a good friend.
They told me there'd
be a bus to the city.
Yes, sir.
Right over there.
Thanks.
Hey, Mom! Danny!
Shawn! Oh, my God.
Hey, buddy.
Oh...
Brian!
Brian!
Sorry, I...
How you doing?
Good. Let's...
Let's go.
Yeah, let's get out of her
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Heid
Yeah?
Heidi, it's Mommy.
Who?
Heidi...
It's, uh,
it's okay, sweetie.
I got it.
Brian.
Lily.
Look at you.
You han't aged a day.
Why didn't you come pick me up?
Didn't...
Didn't they contact you?
Yeah.
You have to try to
undersnd, Lil.
I didn't think I was ever
gonna see you again.
I'm married, Lily.
Carol has been a really
good mother to Heidi and...
we have a son now,
too, a little boy.
I'm sorry.
Lil, I'm...
Lily.
Elizabeth?
Orson?
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.
I know.
Where's the car?
We're going to be late
for dinner.
I'm sorry, hon.
Things got a little
out of control.
But it won't happen again.
Hi, Mom.
Sweetie.
Hey, Shawn.
Oh, y, George.
Hey, guys.
Good to see you.
Hi.
Yeah, sorry your buddies
couldn't show.
I guess most of them
are away at college.
They're just jealous
I get to enjoy two more
years of high school.
High school's not that bad.
Hey, Shawn.
Remember me?
Nikki?
No.
Last time I saw you, you
were just a little kid.
Now look at you. Lucky me, huh?
Yeah, guess so.
What the hell are
you looking at?
I used to live here.
Yeah?
Well, I live here now.
Get the hell out of here.
Why did you
bring me here?
I thought I'd put a human face
on the returnees for you.
Remind you they're
people, not viruses.
Tom.
You going to introduce me
to your new friend?
Uh, Linda, this is,
uh, this is my partner.
My work partner.
Diana Skouris. Diana,
this is my wife, Linda.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
We're separated.
Oh.
Call me.
We need to talk.
Well, that was awkward.
Really?
Yeah.
I hadn't noticed.
Give me a second.
Hey, how you doing?
You look thirsty.
Thank you.
I-I just wanted you
to know I'm...
I really am glad you're back.
Whatever, Uncle Tom.
Geez.
Neck's broken.
Reflection must have
confused him, huh?
Yeah.
Why don't you come back inside?
You're missing your own party.
I know. It's just weird
being in there...
I guess he was just stunned.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
I'll see you in there.
lovely people and that,
thain Quarantine, right?
Besides, there's nothing
we can handle, right, Maia?
That would be nice.
Well, we should get going.
It's a bit of a drive to Everett.
Yeah, terrific.
Good luck, Maia.
You'll see me again.
Yeah, next week.
Sooner than that.
And when we bought the building,
your mother said,
"What? That old thing?"
Can I get you anything?
Uh... water, that'd be fine.
Mary could you get
Mr. Bailey some water?
Just down here.
You know, I can't get over it.
You look exactly the same
as the last time I saw you.
And you were what, 1
Your father asked me
to show you the ropes.
Looks like I succeeded.
Please, have a seat.
Thank you.
So what can I do
for you, Mr. Bailey?
My old corner office,
for starters.
Thank you... A secretary,
some business cards.
I should be able to start
seeing clients within a week or so.
You're looking for a job?
This is still
Kensington & Bailey, isn't it?
I'm embarrassed. Uh...
Times are tight.
I just had to lay off
three of my actuaries.
I don't have any openings
right now, Mr. Bailey.
Openings?
I'm a partner here.
Mr. Bailey,
your interest in this company
was bought out
when you were declared dead.
Well, your wifet dead.
accepted the settlement.
It is all legal.
Don't be too sure of that.
What happened to me...
there is no precedent.
You are right about that,
but it might be years until
precedent is established.
Until that happens,
all of you... returnees
are going to have to get in line
and plead your case
in front of a judge.
I mean, do you have
the kind of resources to...?
Have you seen
the place my wife is in?
I have to get her out of there.
I don't think we should
discuss is any further.
I need money. Now.
The living room...
and there's the kitchen.
Do you want
to see your room?
Okay.
I think it's really nice.
It's the one over here.
Come here.
We just had it redone.
It's a very nice room.
I got you a few outfits to start.
Tomorrow we'll go shopping.
You can pick out
some more yourself.
Okay.
Maia.
Honey.
We have a rule.
No shoes on the furniture.
I don't want them
to get wet.
Wet?
Why would they get wet?
Why don't you get cleaned up?
We're going to eat soon.

Anita?!
Adam, it's Orson.
Let me in.
I want to talk.
I know you
can hear me.
Let me in!
You want me to wake the
whole neighborhood?
Tom?
What are you doing here?
Your phone is off.
Ryland wants us to come in.
What's up?
There's been a murder.
The police are holding
one of the 4400.
That's him.
That's Orson Bailey.
Bailey-- some kind of
businessman, right?
Right.
Life insurance?
Yeah.
Disappeared in the '70s.
'79, declared dead in '86.
Seate police are holding him
in connection with a homicide
in Madison Park last night.
Do they know he's one of the 4400?
Bailey told them.
That why ty called us.
Well, I thought the returnees
were told not to
discuss their status.
Well, weounsel them to avoid it
if they possibly can,
but, you know,
we were talking job interviews
and housing applications.
There's not really a protocol
for being questioned
about a murder.
You said holding, not charging.
That's right. There are
some conflicting reports
about what actually went on
at the crime scene.
We'll check it out.
Quietly.
I don't want to be
dodging microphones
at the 6:00 news.
Quietly it is.
Diana?
Hi, this is Linda.
I can't take your call
right now,
but please leave me a message
and I'll call you back.
Linda, it's me again.
You said we needed to talk,
so pick up the phone.
Linda, come on.
All right, call me.
Everything all right?
Yeah, same old same old.
Call me, don't call me.
I wish she'd make up her mind.
You know, I had
a boyfriend once.
Every time he'd tell...
A boyfriend?
Well, don't look so surprised.
Yeah, anyway,
the thing about this guy
that used to drive.
You can stop.
I barely got started.
All I'm ying is,
yodon't have to try
to make me feel better.
Well, it was more of an attempt
at bonding
via a shared similar experience.
Can you open the door?
How long did you go out
with this guy?
Nine months.
Nine months?
Mm-hmm.
So, you're equating
your nine months
of dating with my 19
years of marriage?
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, forget it.
You want me to drive?
What for?
I don't know. So you can brood?
Just get in.
Look who floated in
on a ball of light.
Remember me, Farrell?
Rossi
Hi
Well, it looks like
the steroids finally kicked in.
Funny man.
Funny.
Always did appreciate
your sense of humor.
Like that time you sold me
those concert tickets
right before you disappeared.
To the Foo Fighters?
How was the show?
I wouldn't know; the cops were
waiting for me when I showed up.
Tickets were stolen, man.
You got me arrested.
You got arrested
for stolen tickets?
Yeah, I had five
tabs of X on me.
I had to pee into a cup once a week
for two years because of you!
Stop it!
Hey, hey! Come on!
Get off of him.
This is between me
and your brother.
Yeah? Well, I'm making
it between you a me.
See you around, freak.
Oh, by the way, how'd you like
the new paint job on your ride?
You okay?
I'm fine.
The security cameras
caught everything.
The guy definitely had
a bug up his ass.
Except, as far as we can tell,
he never went inside.
Kensington fell into all
that glass and impaled himself.
You've been through
all the footage?
Every scrap. Bailey never
made it past the gate.
Wait. Hold on a second.
Did you see that?
That's glass.
Yeah.
Something blew out the windows,
but from the inside.
Yeah, we're still trying
to figure that one out.
There was no seismic activity.
No evidence of a bomb
or a gas leak.
And Bailey's not talking?
We've sent half a dozen guys
in there,
but he hasn't given us anything.
Look, I've been over
and over this with you people.
We're not the police.
We're Homeland Security.
Well, tell the bozos out there
that I had nothing to do
with what happened to Adam.
Let's just go over your d again.
You went to see
Adam Kensington about a job,
and even though
your name is still
on the company letterhead,
he brushed you off.
I know how that'd make me feel.
I admit it, I was angry.
I went to Adam's house to, uh...
I don't know why I went,
but I didn't kill him.
Let me read you an e-mail
Kensington sent his attorney
after your visit.
It's not imptant.
Just a sec.
"Bailey is making desperate claims
"regarding his financial
stake in the company.
"He actually threatened to sue.
"I don't think he realizes
"that there are
probably going to be
"hundreds of lawsuits
involving the 4400.
"It'll take years.
"The poor bastard,
he really is a rather...
pathetic case."
I am not a lawyer,
but I'm not an idiot either.
You've had me here for 12 hours.
Now, either you charge me
with something.
...or let me go.
So, we're just going to let him
walk, after what happened in there?
Yeah, looks like it.
But for futureeference,
if I ever want to play good
cop/bad cop, I'll let you kwow.
Which one do I get to be?
This isn't a joke.
There's a time to lean on a guy,
and that wasn't it.
You shut him down.
Look, I'm sorry.
But Bailey admitted he
was angry with Kensington.
He was at his house.
I didn't say it was over, did I?
Do you think
they ever thought about me?
Oh, sweetie!
They were your parents.
I am sure that they thought
about you every day.
Thanks for bringing me here.
This place used to be so nice.
Now thkids leave their
garbage everywhere.
Ah, it really is a shame.
You don't have to worry.
Crown Ridge is nice.
Crown Ridge Cemetery?
Yes.
That's where you'll be.
Be...?
Be what?
Buried.
Kensington's a popular guy
around here today.
The whole staff's been through
to look at the postmortem.
Yeah, why's that?
Well, he might have been a boring
old suit when he was alive,
but in death... he's a rock star.
God, look at that!
Those were his parietal bones?
We've seen beating deaths in
here as bad as you can imagine.
Even the guy that jumped
off the Space edle
and had to be brought
to us in a garbage bag.
But I have never seen a skull
in this kind of shape before.
Thousands of tiny little
bone fragments...
Kensington was impaled.
Are you saying that's not
how he died?
Oh, that would have killed him,
but he was already dead
from a shattered skull.
Hello?
Hello.
Is, uh... Lily there?
Who?
Is this Heidi?
Yes.
I'm Richard Tyler.
A friend of your mother's.
My mother's name is Carol.
Are you sure you have
the right number?
This is the Moore residence,
isn't it?
Yeah, buthere's no one
named Lily here.
Sorry.
Well, I'm afraid I can't give you
any medicine for the nausea.
Why not?
Because it wouldn't work.
You're not sick, Lily.
You're pregnant.
That's impossible.
The-the quarantine doctors
would have told me.
You said they gave you
a full screening
seven weeks ago.
If you just conceived,
it wouldn't have shown up
in their tests.
Conceived...?!
en?
I assume it happened
right before you disappeared.
But there's no mistake.
You're definitely pregnant.
Now, there's nothing
to worry about.
I would like to see
you again next week,
and you can get used
to the information.
Shawn!
Hey.
How you doing?
Mm... good.
What's up?
You get your car fixed?
It's going to be
in the shop for about a week.
Yeah. You know, Danny
and I are going
to a party tonight at
Eddie Tobin's house.
You should come.
I don't think so.
Why not?
Um, well, they're going
to be listening to music
I've never listened to,
talking about movies
I've never seen.
School is bad enough.
Partying with a bunch
of runts from...
Is that how you saw me, a runt?
You were 14, Nikki.
And now?
I'm late for class.
Where's my wife?
My wife, where is she?
Mr. Bailey, you have our deepest
condolences.
What?
We called your hotel room,
there was no answer. Elizabeth?
It was a pulmonary embolism,
about 1:00 this morning.
We tried to revive her.
No!
A pulmonary embolism...
Please, Mr. Bailey.
Calm down.
Don't tell me e's dead.
Mr. Bailey, just calm down.
She's all I have!
Let go of me!
No!
No!
Get away from me!
So the red dots
mark the spots where
the American members
of the 4400 originally lived.
You mean the returnees.
Not according to the press.
It's the 4400.
You know, you have to admit,
it's a bit strange,
a nice round number like that.
ff
I wonder if it has any significance.
So you're saying that
if 3,781 people
had suddenly showed
up that night,
it wouldn't have been as strange?
I'd say... slightly less strange.
This, however, is downright weird.
Here's where the 4400 are right now,
two weeks after their release.
65% are still in Seattle.
They're just not going home.
And none of them can come up
with a good reason as to why.
You think it means something?
In the CDC, we'd call this
a statistically significant
disease cluster.
Yeah, well, in the FBI,
we'd call it a freaky coincidence.
Well, I don't believe
in coincidences.
Disease clusters.
I lieve in those.
What do you mean,
you're pregnant?
I just found o a few days ago.
I don't understand.
When you were disappeared,
I'd been in New York
for weeks studying for the bar.
I can't explain it.
I haven't been with anyone else.
So what are we talking,
immaculate conception?
I don't know what
we're talking about.
I wish I did.
You know, when you disappeared...
I would have given
anything in the world
to talk to you again.
I had whole conversations
with you in my head.
I missed you so much, Lily.
But we can't do this.
I have another family now.
And I'm sorry, I know
that's not fair  you, but...
Brian, I'm still
part of your life,
whether you want me to be or not.
Lily, you haven't been a part of
my life for 11 years.
I want to see Heidi.
I'm sorry, that's impossible.
She's my daughter.
She doesn't know that.
She thinks that Carol is her mother.
You never told her about me?
She was a baby when you left.
Hell, we were babies when you left.
You can't stop me from seeing her.
I already have.
What is that?
It's a temporary
restraining order.
Brian,
I haven't done anything wrong.
Lily, I'm a lawyer.
I know how to work the system.
Now, I don't want to u this,
but I will if you force me to.
My first priority has
to be to protect my family.
I am your family.
I wish you were,
but you're not.
Not anymore.
I'm sorry, Lil, I'm asking you,
please, stay away from Heidi.
And from me.
I'm sorry, Lil.
At first I thought
it was an earthquake.
Everything was shaking, falling
off the walls.
But then-- I can't believe
I'm going to say this--
things started to fly
around the room.
Paper, chairs.
What do you mean, fly?
I mean fly, like it was a tornado.
Except there was no wind.
Everybody was screaming,
Mr. Bailey was shouting.
My head felt like
it was going to burst.
And then suddenly it was over.
What about Bailey?
Oh, he looked scared.
Like the rest of us.
That's when he ran away.
The staff... everyone's saying
he's one of these people,
the 4400.
Is that true?
Listen to me very carefully.
You are not going
to talk about this
to the press or anyone else,
and the same goes for your staff.
If I pick up a paper
and see a word of this
or I see it reported on the news,
I'm going to take an
interest in this place.
Things flying around the room.
I know, but we got
a half dozen witnesses
all saying the same thing.
Yeah, flying.
I've got to do a briefing
for Home Sec DC
in the morning and I'm
going to tell them what?
Well, I'd go with
"the incident is
under investigation."
Bailey checked out
of his hotel
after he left the nursing home.
He could be on the run,
we're not sure.
Find him.
You bought us some time,
but this story's going to leak
and I want Bailey in our
hands before it does.
So is calculus everything
you remember it to be?
Uh, you heard about
Williamson and
Ms. Sinclair, right?
No.
No?
Oh, they found them in
the janitor's closet.
What is that?
Making out, not dead.
What?
Everybody in school's
been talking about it.
Yo, freak.
You still hiding behind
your little brother?
You know what,
Brad?
You need to shut it down.
You want to shut me down?
You know, the only thing I'm
shutting down is you, bitch.
You're really starting
to piss me off now.
Come on. Bring it.
Shut me down.
Let him go.
Shawn!
What did you do to him?
I dHey, keep your voice down,
here anyshe'll hear you.
It's bad enough she tells us
we're going to be buried
at Crown Ridge Cemetery,
but the next day we get a brochure
from the place in the mail?
It a coincidence.
Look, she's not what we expected,
so let's just talk to her.
Yeah. I...
Maia...
It's okay.
I knew I wasn't going
to be here very long.
Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Give me the ball.
Your shot, space boy.
What is your problem, Danny?
What's my problem?
Yeah, what's your problem?
at'd you do to Brad?
Come on, Danny.
Not you, too. Come o
The way he went down,
that's not normal.
You know it, I know it,
everybody saw it.
What are you saying?
You tell me.
I didn't do anything to him,
all right, Danny?
Not a thing.
And is this all that's
left when you're done?
I mean, poor Mrs. Bailey.
It's a box of trinkets.
They're not trinkets,
they're memories.
The kind you leave behind,
you know, for your
family and friends.
I should get to work on that.
I'm not going there.
Well, believe it or not,
some of us arhappier alone.
No one's happier alone.
If they think that,
they're kidding themselves.
I thought you weren't going there.
You see this?
This looks promising.
"Wyler Summer Cabin."
Wyler was Elizabeth's
maiden name.
Orson's panicking,
he needs a place to run.
Well, there's no address.
We'll have to find one.
It's better this way.
For everyone.
Everyone?  Or just you?
Maia, honey, you know
this isn't about you.
You are a wonderful girl.
It's just, Kenneth and I,
we just made a mistake.
We're t ready to be parents yet.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
But, sweetie, those things you say,
they can scare people
if you're not careful.
Do you understand?
Good.
For you.
Go ahead, take it.
Wh is it?
A CD I burned.
Think of it as a crash course
in all things new and cool.
The Darkness,
Handsome Boy, Modeling School,
Killing Joke.
All the bands you never heard of.
Thank yo But, Nikki,
I could listen to all the music
and watch all the shows,
but it wouldn't matter
'cause they're still going to
look at meike I'm differt.
At least you'll be listening
to some good music.
I don't understand.
See, because everybody
has been looking at me
like I'm somkind of monster
since the fight. But you...
aren't you afraid
to be seenith me
No.
What do I care
what those creeps think?
If you like the CD,
I'll burn you another one.
Sounds great.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
See you.
I'll talk to you later.
Okay.
Hello?
Okay, bring up the satellite shots.
So we're looking for a small house
with a north-facing exposure
somewhere within the vicinity
of Appleton Lake.
If it's still standing.
No structures in grids one,
two, three and nine.
Four and seven each have one,
but they're the wrong shape.
Let's eliminate all those.
That leaves us with
five, six and eight.
That's too small.
at's the wrong orientation.
That's too small, that's too big.
Nothing but trees in eight.
It's not there anymore.
Hang on a second.
Get in a little tighter on this.
Well... it looks like
it could be a house.
No, this was taken 50 years ago.
These trees would be huge by now.
Enlarge again.
Bingo.
Thers your house.
Bingo.
Appleton's what, aut 70 miles?
Yeah.
Look, when we get up there,
I'll handle Bailey.
All right.
Are we leaning on him?
No leaning.
No problem.
Excuse me. You Tom Baldwin?
Yeah, who are you?
You've been served.
Sorry, man.
You're getting sued?
Linda's filed for divorce.
Lily.
Richard!
Richard.
Oh.
I don't understand.
I... I thought you went home.
I did, but there was
nothing there for me.
But, uh...
How did you find me here?
Woodland Park, right?
This is where you used
to bring Heidi.
Richard, was terrible.
Brian's remarried.
Heidi doesn't know anything...
Hello, Maia.
Hello.
Oh... I like it out here.
It's much better
than my stuffy office.
But you didn't bring me out here
to talk about the weather.
You're a very smart little girl.
Thank you.
The thing is...
that the Griffins didn't
really give a reason
why they brought you back.
Maybe they didn't have a reason.
Could be.
Were they mean to you?
No.
Were you mean to them?
No.
Why do you think you're back here?
I don't think they like kids mh.
Why do you say that?
They brought me back and I'm a kid.
You don't really want to tell me
the reason, do you?
That's okay.
Maybe you'll change
your mind one day.
Maybe.
Hi, this is Linda.
I can't take your call right now,
but please leave me a message
and I'll call you back.
What, she's still not answering?
Nope.
Can I ask you a question?
No.
Well, I'm going to ask you anyway.
So your son, how long
has he been in a coma?
Three years.
That's a long time.
You have no idea.
Maybe you and your wife,
you can work things out?
You know, one day
Kyle's going to wake up
and I'll have to tell him his
whole family's fallen apart.
I go to that hospital every day
and I tell myself that
makes me a good father.
Oh, you are a good father.
Kyle's lucky to have a dad like you.
Not everyone does.
You can trust me, 'cause I know.
A baby?
You sure?
I had the doctors
do the test three times.
'Cause the thing is that Brian
was out of town when I disappeared
and I haven't been with
anyone since I've been back.
I don't understand it.
How-how could you be...?
I don't know.
I'm sorry to be dumping this
on you.
It doesn't...
It's not really fair.
It's okay.
I want to help.
There's some sort of connection
between us, isn't there?
I feel it.
I can feel it, too.
That's why I came back.
But it's more complicated
than that.
Your grandmother and I,
we weren't just friends,
it was... it was more than that.
We were going to start a family.
I think part of me already knew that.
The way you talk about her.
The look in your eye.
Here it is, I thought
I was playing it so safe.
It must have been difficult,
the two of you,
a white woman
and a black man in the '50s.
Mmm. Black. Back then
I was Negro, colored or worse.
We didn'care.
We figured after the war,
we'd take off to some big city
like Chicago or New York or Paris.
But you never made it home.
No.
I never did.
I'm glad you found me.
Me, too.
* Bye, bye, baby *
* Don't be long *
* I worry about you *
* When you're gone *
* Bye, bye, baby *
* Don't be long *
* I worry about you... *
Mr. Bailey, it's Tom Baldwin,
Homeland Security.
We met at the police station,
remember?
Mr. Bailey, we're here
to help but you've got
to talk to us.
Go away.
I'm afraid we can't do that.
I just want to be left alone.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
That's good because we don't
want anyone else hurt.
If you leave, I promise
no one will ever see me again.
I'll just stay here...
Listen to me...
...away from everyone.
We both know that's not going
to work, Mr. Bailey.
Now please, open the door.
We can figure this out together.
I'm on your side.
No, you're not.
No one is.
My nephew, he's one of the 4400.
Just like you.
I've seen how hard it is for him.
I know it's even harder for you.
You don't know anything.
My wife, she was
everything to me.
Believe me, I'm sorry
for your loss.
I don't want any pity
out of you.
Go away!
I just want
to be left alone.
We can't do that.
I said...
get away from me.
Stay away, please.
Tom.
Your nose.
Hold on...
I can't control it.
I can't control it.
Whatever it is you're
doing, Mr. Bailey, stop it.
I can't control it.
Stop it now!
You all right?
Yeah.
I'll call for an ambulance.
Okay.
We're going to get you
some help, Mr. Bailey.
Just don't die on me.
Well, he's alive.
But it doesn't look like he's
going to be talking to us anytimsoon.
As far as the general public's
concerned,
we're going to deny it
ever happened.
Yeah, but we know better.
The question is,
will it happen again?
So what do you suggest we do
Round them all up and put
them back in quarantine?
You saw what Bailey could do.
I mean, you felt it...
same as me.
Who knows what the rest
of them are capable of.
I sure as hell don't.
But then again,
it's not my job to find out.
It's yours.
Aren't you glad you wanted back in?
I never thanked you
for saving my life.
I never shot anyone before.
But seeing him lying
there like that...
You going to be okay?
Yeah, I'll get there.
You know, I meant what
I said to Ryland back there.
If Orson can do those things,
who knows where all this is going?
So far we've got one case
and maybe that's all
we'll ever have.
You ever noticed anything
unusual with Shawn?
Because I just need to know
if you had, you'd tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
Wha...?
Yeah, look at this guy.
There's like three other
sites just like this,
but this one's got a lot more
stuff than the other ones.
What are you guys doing?
Research.
On T 4400 scoop.com?
It's just...
You know, the web, there's
a site for everything.
"The Forty-Four Hundred Menace"?
I know this guy.
I was in quarantine with him.
They're saying he killed someone
just by thinking about it.
So that makes me
some kind of freak?
No. No, we were just...
I want to know how you
took Brad down so fast.
Come on, he did someing
to him, you saw it.
Danny, you have no idea what
you're talking about.
Neither do you.
Shawn.
What?
You were thinking the same thing.
All right, listen up, everyone.
We're at DEFCON 1.
It's a comet.
It's not a flyby anymore.
A comet cannot change course.
This one has.
Then it's not a comet.
We're not sure what's happened.
There appears
to be something out there.
The light is gone,
and-and thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.
Finding Shawn and figuring out
what happened to our son-
that is my job.
Diana Skouris,
Tom Baldwin.
You two will be
one of the teams
that's responsible
for investigating
what happened to the returnees.
And what about my parents?
They're dead, aren't they?
This is Maia Rutledge.
She's eight years old,
only she was born
in 1938.
No time has ssed.
Returnee 2117: Shawn Frell.
Uncle mmy.
Hi.
He's all yours.
Hey, what about Kyle?
Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.
We're letting them go.
We're letting them go?
We don't have
a legal right to hold them.
Hey, Mom, Dad!
Shawn!
Hey, buddy.
Remember me?
Nikki?
I'm Richard.
Lily.
Lily Bonham from St. Louis?
You knew my granother.
Some of these people
have no place to go,
no families left. What the
hell are you looking at?
I used to live here.
Heidi?
Yeah?
Heidi, it's Mommy.
It's, uh... it's okay,
sweetie, I got it.
Brian.
Lily.
But there's no mistake.
You're definitely pregnant.
It's a temporary
restraining order.
You can't stop me
from seeing her.
If Orson can do those things,
who knows
where all this is going.
So far we've got one case,
and maybe that's all
we'll ever have.
You haven't noticed
anything unusual with Shawn?
'Cause I just need
to know-
if you had, you'd tell me.
What looks good
today, Carl?
I have a whitefish
with your name on it,
Mrs. Martino.
Oh.
When you were gone,
in 18 month,
I haven't got a decent piece
of fish.
You...
You take care of me.
You are such a sweetheart.
Aw, it's easy
being nice to you.
Tell me,
how does it feel
to be back?
It's okay.
It's good.
Carl.
It's like I never left.
What do you think
you're doing out there?
I was helping a customer.
Rosie
can help a customer.
Derek can help a customer.
I told you to stock
the display cases.
BuI-I...
I've known Mrs. Martino
since I was a kid.
And I'm supposed to care?
Now get that
flounder on ice.
Grace!
So how'd it go today?
It was slow, as usual.
It's the neighborhood.
It's not like it used to be.
It's not that bad.
Ug It's gotten
a lot worse
since you were away.
I don't see it.
You don't want
see it.
Okay.
I admit it, it's not like
when we were kids.
Yeah, no one cares
about the place anymore.
There's no pride.
There's no sense
of community.
I didn't know
you were so unhappy.
I'm not unhappy.
Hey, I got you
back, didn't I?
I gonothing to
complain about.
Yeah.
Oh...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Fish smell.
I don't mind.
I'll hop in the shower
as soon as we get back.
Hey, let's cut across the park.
The park?
Nobody goes into
Bradley Park anymore.
No.
Yeah? Sure they do.
No.
How do you think I got here?
It's not safe.
There's nothing
but lowlifes
and junkies in there.
Grace, 15 years ago,
I proposed to you
in this park.
Aw...
15 years ago?
Yeah.
I was a size 2,
and you had your hair down
to your shoulders.
Things change.
From now on,
you take the long way around
You know, Grace, I just wish
that you'd, you know...
...stop worrying.
Marry me, Gracie.
Of course I will.
Yo, what are you doing
in our park, man?
Your park?
Ju give up your wallet.
You're mugging me?
Now you're
catching on.
Seven bucks?
It's all I have.
* So long ago *
* Another life *
* I can feel your heartbeat *
* It's not a dream *
* Remember us *
* I can see it inour eyes *
* We'll find our place in time *
* Our place in time
beyond the sun *
* We'll find our place in time *
* Our place in time
to call our own *
So the complaints started
right after her foster parents
brought her back
to quarantine last week.
Well, what kind of complaints?
Well, for instance,
yesterday, Maia was talking
to an employee in the cafeteria.
She told her
her daughter would be
in the hospital soon,
but that she'd be okay.
The next day, the little girl
was in a car accident.
So you're saying what?
She-She's got some kind
of second sight?
I'm saying I have five stories
just like that one.
Why disappear
a little girl
from the 1940s,
hold her for 60 years,
and then send her back
with the ability to
predict the future?
I mean, what were
they thinking?
"They"? We don't even know
if there is a "they."
He, she, it-
take your pick.
Somebody's behind this.
You know, let's leave that
for the team
in the theory room, huh?
Yeah, when they're not
playing video games.
Oh, that's why they're
intimidated by you, Tom.
They feel your hostility.
Good.
I wouldn't worry too much
about the big brains.
Just talk to that girl.
Thanks.
I never meant
to scare anymore.
We know that, sweeti
But why did
you say those things
to Mrs. Krause
about her daughter?
Because they're true.
But how did you know?
I just do.
If I asked you
whether it was going
to rain next Sunday,
would you know the answer?
Maybe.
I don't know.
What's going
to happen to me now?
The doctors here are going
to take another look at you.
Oh, don't worry.
It won't hurt.
I don't believe you.
It's going to hurt, isn't it?
You might be uncomfortable
some of the time,
but mostly, oh,
it's just going to be boring.
Will you look in on me
every now and then?
Me?
To see that I'm all right?
Sure.
It's expensive, though.
The rental vouchers
will cover it.
So... do you
have any questions?
Um,
the small bedroom-
do you think
it'll get too much light
for a nursery, I mean?
It's a northern exposure,
so you should be all right.
So, what do you think?
I like it.
Me, too.
Is this your first baby?
Oh, we're not actually
a couple.
Oh, uh, so, it's just you
and the baby?
No, it'll be the three of us.
Why not?
You can't stay
in that hotel forever.
We can share this place.
Unless you don't want to.
No.
No, I'd like that.
Great.
I'll go do the paperwork.
I hope I didn't barrass you.
No, it's... it's not that.
It's, uh...
It's just, I figure
he wouldn't rentou the place
if I was part the deal.
I know, I know.
It's not 1951 anymore.
Times have changed, but...
Sometimes I'm just surprised
at how much.
Good.
It's settled then?
Oh, God.
Lily? Lily, what is it?
No.
Oh.
Lily.
No, I... I don't feel so good.
You need to sit down.
Should I call a doctor?
No, no.
No, I... I just have to leave.
And go where?
Anywhere but here.
Carl, where have you been?
I got mugged.
Oh, God, are you all right?
Did they hurt you?
No, I didn't get hurt.
They got hurt.
Who did?
Grace, I learned
something tonight,
something important.
I'm a different man.
Those aliens-
or whoever took me-
they did something.
They took me;
they changed me.
They made me better.
I think first thing
in the morning
you should call the counselor
and make an appointment.
What? No.
I don't have time for that.
I got things to do.
What kind of things?
The park, Gracie.
I want to make it
like it was before.
People will bring
their kids there again.
You and me-
we can have our picnics
at the old spot.
Carl, you're scaring me.
There's nothing to be scared of,
not anymore.
Linda, any idea
why Dr. Mayhew wants to see us?
He didn't say.
So how have you been?
Good.
My lawyer was asking if you'd
signed those divorce papers yet.
I thought maybe if
we had dinner some night,
you know, we could...
sign them together.
Oh, you mean make plans
that you'd cancel
at the last minute?
I'll bring the papers,
we'll have a good meal,
a couple glasses of wine...
And a good cry?
That, too.
Stefano's?
Where else?
Tom, Linda-
thanks for coming in.
I was reviewing
Carl's EEG readout,
and I noticed
something peculiar.
What now?
Well, it seems
last Thursday night
he had a momentary burst
of increased brain activity.
It was brief- no more
than a few seconds.
That's good, isn't it?
Technically, yes.
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.
I'm going to run some tests,
see if I can find
out what happened.
Tests- we've had
three years of tests.
I understand your frustration,
Linda,
but we really need
to look into this.
It's a roller coaster,
isn't it?
It never ends.
Linda...
So, Stefano's, right?
How does Thursday
night sound? 70?
I'll be there.
Dorothy...
Yeah?
Did anyone visit my son
last Thursday night
besides his mother
and me?
Let me check.
Yes, he had one
other visitor:
Your nephew Shawn.
Shawn!
Yeah, I went and s Kyle
on Thursday night.
He's my cousin.
I wanted to see him.
What about it?
And nothing happened
while you were there?
Well, I was ly there
for a couple minutes.
So, you saw nothing,
did nothing?
What could I have done?
The day of your welcome home
party, a bird
smacked into the window,
remember?
Yeah, it was stunned.
at about it?
No, it wasore than that.
And then... you picked it up
and suddenly,
it was alive and well.
What the hell did you do
to Kyle?
I didn't do anything to him!
Look, look, I really like
these little chats we have,
Uncle Tommy,
but I got to go to class.
Shawn.
We'll talk again.
Oh, I can't wait.
A bunch of us are going to see
Fountains of Wayne
this weekend.
Have fun.
You know, um, this whole
loner thing is so tired.
Well, it works for me.
Fountains of Wayne!
Friday night!
What is with you?
Why do you keep
pushing him like that?
Someone has to.
I don't see you
doing anything.
Well, I'm giving him his space.
Let him figure things
out for himself.
You should try it sometime.
Oh...!
Marco.
Skouris- good.
I checked out your idea.
What idea?
So, am I a genius, or am I crazy?
We don't make that distinction
in here.
of disappearance sites on the
West Coast, like you suggested.
Turns out you were right.
The avity at those
sites is weaker.
But according to
the interferometer,
only by five parts per billion.
That's barely measurable.
Not to mention
barely understandable.
English, please.
The gravity is changed
at some of the places
where people disappeared.
The question is
did it change naturally,
or was it articially manipulated.
Now, if the gravity
was manipulated,
the question then becomes by who.
So we're back to
the possibility
of alien abductions.
I wouldn't rule out
little green men,
but obviously I'm going to need
to take more measurements.
So, in other words,
you've made no progress.
Uh, you explain it to him.
Oh, hold on.
You remember Adam Kensington?
The, uh, insurance guy
Orson Bailey killed?
Yeah, what about him?
Not one of the good guys,
as it turns out.
He was point man
in a huge insurance scheme
to defraud tens of thousands
of policyholders.
Orson Bailey
saved the State of Washington
like, a billion-dollar buyout.
Could've been Enron
all over again.
God, that's interesting,
'cause that brings up
all kinds of possibilities.
Well, uh, don't be a stranger.
Oh...
So, this thing about Bailey.
Are you trying to say
whoever sent him back
meant him to go
after Kensington?
It's a theory.
That's why they call it
"the theory room."
That's tight.
Oh, no, I suck.
Hey, if this is about
the, uh, concert thing...
No, no, no, it's got nothing
to do about that.
I just want to know
what's going on
with you and Nikki.
Me and Nikki what?
I just want to know
what's going on between you two.
Well,
what do you think's going on?
Something.
She's always talking about you.
Can't go anywhere or do anything
without her wanting
to bring you along.
How is that my problem, Danny?
Just do me a favor.
Leave her alone, okay?
Oh...
I thought
that's what I've been doing.
Look, Danny, you got a problem
with your girlfriend,
go talk to her about it, okay?
Hey, uh...
we're the same age.
I'm not your little brother
anymore.
Then stop ting
like a two-year-old.
You're my brother.
She's your girlfriend.
It's all good...
right?
Yeah, right.
Oh, Richard, I am so glad
we found this place.
And now that we got an apartment,
we can get you a computer.
Forget abouthe computer.
I still think we need
to get you to a doctor.
I'm fine.
I know this is going
to sound strange,
but that other place
we looked at-
the baby didn't like it.
Marnal instinct's
kicking in already, huh?
No, it's not that.
It's that somehow...
I know what the baby's thinking.
Lily, the baby's
barely two months along.
It's not thinking anything.
Look, I can't explain it
any more than you can explain...
where you've been
for the past 50 years
or, or what's happened
to any of us
during the time we've been gone.
I don't sound too strange, do I?
Of course not.
Lily?
I used to rock Heidi like that
when she was a baby.
It feels like yesterday,
but it wasn't, was it?
No.
It was... what, 11 years ago?
I want to see Heidi.
I miss her.
Lily, give it some time.
Once Brian
is used to you being back,
he'll drop
the restraining order.
Shut up.
Just shut up!
Stop it! Cut it out!
It isn't funny!
Shut up! Just shut up!
Grab her legs, man.
Hey, guys.
Why don't you leave her alone?
Get lost!
No.
You get lost.
Go get him, man. Come on.
Hey, Maia.
How long have they
left you like this?
A while.
I think they all wt
on their coffee break.
Well, you know...
that's pretty dumb
of them, isn't it?
Will you stay
until they come back?
Of course.
And when they show up,
your doctors and I,
we're going to have
a little talk.
And then can I go home?
Home?
With you.
I don't like being here alone.
You want to come and stay with me?
You don't like
being alone, either.
I can always come back
for my checkups.
Please.
Look, Maia...
I'm not even sure
I'm the kind of person
I want to live with.
No, I-I eat cold pizza
for breakfast and...
That sounds all right to me.
Yeah, you know, Maia...
Just let me think
about it, okay?
Where have you been?
I was looking in on Maia.
Really.
Well, I promised her,
didn't I?
So, what do you got?
Sid e-mailed the latest
rearch clippings to us.
I think I found something
worth checking out.
One guy taking on three attackers
doesn't sound that farfetched.
I know, but if you saw him
you'd think it was impossible.
He was, uh, 35, 40.
Maybe 5'6".
Wehed 150 pounds.
So not exactly The Rock, huh?
But it was the way
that he moved.
Could he have been on
some kind of drug, maybe PCP?
He didn't act
like he was on drugs.
You know,
most guys would have walked away,
or, uh, maybe called the cops,
later, after it was
too late, but, uh...
this guy- he saved me.
I'm sorry.
Baldwin.
Linda.
Dinner, yeah. No.
Linda, I'm so...
Don't hang up, Linda.
Just, just...
Is there anything else
you can remember?
There is one thing.
This guy,
I don't mean
to be rude or anything,
but, uh, he smelled funny.
Like day-old fish.
So that was your
wife on the phone?
Excuse me... I don't
want to talk about it.
Fair enough.
So what, are we
in Orson Bailey territory here?
Well, I wouldn't rule it out.
Which would give us what?
A telekinetic insurance salesman,
a clairvoyant eight-year-old
and now some kind of
sad-sack super-vigilante.
Hell of a trio.
And those are only
the ones we know about.
Unless you can think
of anyone else.
Just take it one case at a time.
Heidi, do you remember
the formula
for an isosceles triangle?
Hey, buddy.
I saw that.
Richard...
Lily- Thank God.
Are you all right?
I been worried sick.
Where are you?
I've been arrested.
Carl...
I have my grandchildren
coming for dinner.
Uh, how 'bout
some nice swordfish?
You can't go wrong
with swordfish.
Carl!
Uh, give me a second, Burt.
You got, like...
What did I tell you about
chatting with customers
when there's work to be done?
Stop with the finger.
Stop...
I asked you
not to do that.
Let go.
I mean it.
I show up on time.
I do my work.
Now just leave me alone, okay?
Okay, okay.
So, how much swordsh
are we talking here?
I'm telling you, Tom,
there's a lot of chatter in DC
about putting the 4400
back in quarantine.
Not that I agree.
I mean, if they're
so dangerous,
how is cramming th
all into one space
going to make us
any safer?
So I took my pistol
and I shot her in the forehead.
Shot who?
Do us a favor, Tom.
Sign the divorce papers.
Do me a far, Dennis.
Stay out of it.
I spoke to her.
What are you doing
talking to Linda?
I've known her for 20 years.
I danced with her at your wedding.
Now I'm not supposed
to talk to her.
I was in the middle
of an investigation.
Tom, you asked her for dinner,
and you stood her up.
It slipped my mind.
Maybe.
Maybe you just don't want to
admit the truth to yourself.
Brian Moore?
Yeah.
I'm Richard Tyler,
a friend of Lily's.
Are you another one
of those 4400?
Is that a problem?
Look,
I warned her;
I told her to stay away,
but she wouldn't listen.
I understand you're set,
but Lily's in jail.
You don't want that.
What I want is a normal life
for my daughter, for my family.
She made a mistake.
It won't happen again.
I'm just supposed to take
your word for it?
I promise, you drop the charges...
she'll never bother you
or Heidi ever again.
You used to love her once,
remember?
Yeah, I remember.
I want you to stop.
I can't.
What do you mean, "can't"?
What you're doing
is dangerous,
not to mention illegal.
You can't just
go around beating people up.
I've been given an oppornity
here, Gracie,
and I'm going to take it.
I'm going to clean up that park,
and when I'm finished,
I'm going to clean up
the whole neighborhood.
Oh, God.
You sound like a crazy man.
You promised me you'd
call your counselor.
I never said that.
You said that.
Come tomorrow, I'm
going to call him.
You'd call Homeland Security on me?
If that's what it takes.
The way you're acting,
can you blame me?
What I'm doing here
I'm doing for us, Grace.
This is where we live.
I just want us to be happy
and to not be afraid anymore,
and it starts with Bradley Park.
And I don't want it to end there.
It won't. I won't let it.
They can't hurt me.
No one can.
Oh...
You're just one man.
I lost you once,
and I don't want
to lose you again.
I can do it.
I can make this neighborhood
safe again.
For you, for Mrs. Martino...
even Burt.
So please, stop worrying.
This is what I was meant to do.
This is my destiny.
*...or is this your way *
* To hide a broken heart? *
* Many dreams *
* Have been brought
to your doorstep *
* They just lie there *
* And they die there *
* Are you warm, are you real *
* Mona Lisa... *
This was brand-new
when I disappeared.
And it's a...
What'd you call it, a...?
Golden oldie.
Oh.
I guess I'm a golden oldie, too.
No, not to me.
Lily, we have to talk about
what happened last night.
No, there's nothing
to talk about.
Do you know what I saw
when I looked
through Brian's window?
A happy family.
I realized Heidi doesn't need me.
Well, maybe one day she...
Yeah, I'll be there
r her, if she does.
But until then, I...
I'll stay away.
This is where I want to be now.
Here with you.
Where I'm happy,
and the baby's happy.
Well, that makes three
happy people then.
All you've done for me...
it's not because I remind you
of the other Lily, is it?
Maybe at first.
But now all I see is you.
* Mona Lisa *
* Mona Lisa. *
Danny's inside.
I'm not here
to see Danny.
Cute. Could you turn it
back on, please?
Did Danny say something to you?
Is that why you're acting
like this?
Because our friendship
has nothing to do with him.
Nikki...
we don't have a friendship, okay?
Shawn, listen to me...
Hey, hey, hey, come here.
Let me see. Let me see.
Let me see what's going on.
It's okay. It's okay.
Let me see.
It's gone.
It doesn't hurt anymore.
Must not have been
that bad of a burn.
Yes, it was.
You did something
to it, didn't you?
*...And be the one who
catches all your tears *
* That's why I need you to hear *
* I've found out a reason for me *
* To change who I used to be *
* A reason to start over new *
* And the reason is you. *
Tom.
See, the thing about vigilantes
is that they're not very common,
except in Charles Bronson movies,
so I had to create my own profile.
Now, we know he's
a white male, slender,
somewhere between 30 and 50.
He probably works a blue-collar job,
suffers from low self-esteem,
lives in a high-crime area.
I'm with you so far.
Right. So I cross-
checked my profile
with the members of the 4400
in and around the Seattle area,
and I came up with 37 names.
You're not going to take me
through all 37, are you?
Of those 37, I was able
to eliminate 24-
I'm sure you don't care how-
and that left me with 13.
I'm on the edge of my seat.
Here are my o favorites.
Robert Laurenzano
and Carl Morrissey.
They both fit the profile,
but Carl- he's our guy.
Check out his occupation.
Supermarket employee.
Yeah. I called the store.
Carl works in the seafood section.
And our guy smelled
like day-old fish.
Oh, yeah. I'm good.
Hey!
What the hell you doing?
I just cleaned that.
What?
Do you know
where your husband is?
We'd like to talk to him.
Why?
Any idea where he
was Tuesday night?
He was here.
You sure about that?
I just told you.
Have you heard of the Bradley
Park Vigilante?
Wh-What does that have to do
with Carl?
You tell us, Mrs. Morrissey.
You're not going to throw him
back into quarantine, are you?
We want to help him.
That's funny. That's all Carl
wants to do is help.
People grumble. They complain.
Nobody does anything.
Nobody tries to make
anything better except Carl.
Where is he, Mrs. Morrissey?
Carl.
Grace, I got rid
of all the graffiti.
Oh, my... oh, my God, Carl.
Oh, you should've seen it.
They, uh...
they were falling like bowling pins.
I didn't see the knife.
I don't know why
I didn't see the knife.
Get an ambulance!
It's a nice night.
No, no, no, stay here.
Just sit with me.
No...
I thought I could clean it up.
I thought I could clean the
whole neighborhood up myself.
I thought that's why
they sent me back here,
but I guess I was wrong, huh?
No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah.
No, don't leave me,
Carl, please.
No, no!
No! I just want you.
I just... I just want you.
No, no!
No!
No...
Why take this guy,
give him enough extra juice
to think he can make
a difference, send him back...
Only to get himself killed.
What's the point?
I wish to hell I knew.
Grace Morrissey,
wife of slain Bradley Park
Vigilante Carl Morrissey,
revealed today that her
late husband was one of
the controversial 4400.
Mrs. Morrissey went on to state
that her husband was a true
neighborhood hero,
a sentiment echoed
by many area residents.
Local law enforcement officials,
as well as a spokesperson for
the National Threat
Assessment Command,
refused to confirm or deny
Mrs. Morrissey's statement.
Okay, I got the paperwork.
Okay, I need you to sign there...
and there...
and initial here...
Mm-hmm.
and sign there.
So that's it?
You got Mr. Ryland's
signed approval.
That simplifies things.
I thought you were
one of the doctors.
Yeah. I thought you were asleep...
so you sure fooled me.
How would you like
to get out of here?
Now?
Right now.
Look out, look out,
look out. Thanks.
Where'Kyle?
Surgery.
Dr. Mayhew said he's got
some kind of fluid
building up in his skull,
and they're going to try and
relieve some of the pressure.
What do they mean, try?
They said
the draining fluid
might not be enough,
that... that-that more
might build up,
and if it does, then Kyle
could suffer permanent
brain damage within a week.
Uncle Tommy...
Mom's on the way.
Previously on The 4400...
All right, listen up, everyone.
We're at DEFCON One.
A comet cannot change course.
This one has.
Then it's not a comet.
We're not sure what's just happened.
The light is gone
and thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared...
A lekinetic insurance salesman,
a clairvoyant eight-year
old, and now some kind
of sad sack super vigilante.
They can't hurt me.
No one can.
And those are only
the ones we know about.
Unless you can think
of anyone else.
There's nothing to tell.
I just want to know what's
going on between you two.
Yore my brother.
She's your girlfriend.
It's all good.
No. Wee not actually a couple.
So, it's just you and the baby?
No. It'll be the three of us.
What the hell
did you do to Kyle?
I didn't do anythingo him!
Then can I go home?
Home?
With you.
I don't like being here alone.
You don't like being alone either.
They said draining the fluid
might not be enough--
That more might build up,
and if it does...
then Kyle will suffer
permanent brain damage.
The time I lost is gone.
I'll never get it back.
But my years in the dark
didn't kill me
and my work remains.
And even though
I might not understand
what's happening to me,
I have faith in the final outcome.
After all...
I'm doing what I was intended to do,
becoming what I was meant to be.
I look forward to corresponding
with you again.
I know it's been a long time.
I tell you this as a courtesy.
You can observe my work,
but there's no point
triyng to interfere with it.
I'm now in full command
of my talents.
I hope the world is ready.
Despite nationwide protests,
Homeland Security reses
to divulge the names
or the whereabouts
of the 4400 living here
in the United States.
Confirmed reports of unusual abilities
have the public panicked,
and yet this man sitting beside me
says we have nothing
to worry about.
I'm sure most of you
still recognize him,
even though he's been away
for the past 28 months.
I'm talking about Mr. Jordan Collier,
who recently breached
the government's wall of silence
and chose to out himself
as one of the notorious 4,400.
Jordan...
why?
Why now, why here?
What's your agenda?
I have no agenda.
But someone had to put
a human face on the 4,400.
We have been demonized
enough by people like you.
Well, if you're implying
this is a witch hunt,
I disagree.
You're not the one
being burned at the stake.
Breakfast is ready.
Shouldn't I be saying that to you?
Maia, thank you very much.
This beats a can of Coke
and slice of cold pizza.
And I promise, I will get better
at being the grownup
in this relationship.
It's okay.
I like bei the grownup.
You know, I think
you're going to have a good time
with Mrs. Banky
'cause I hear
she's a very cool baby-sitter.
Oh, and I talked to Mr. Ryland
about getting permission
to get you enrolled in school
because that would be nice, right?
Yeah.
School might be fun.
Diana...
you're not going
to like what's in there.
Oliver Knox disappeared
August 22, 1983,
five nights after the last
of the eight bodies turned up
And he moved back
to Friday Harbor when?
About three weeks ago.
19 days before
the latest body turned up.
You know, it could be coincidence.
And the letter the guy
sent appears genuine,
but this latest victim
wasn't a prostitute.
The eight original ones were.
Coincidence.
That's the kind of positive thinking
we like to encourage
in this department.
Because if it is Knox,
then it means we've got
a 4400 serial killer on our hands,
and if that's not
a worst-case scenario,
it'll sure as hell do for one.
It's the kind of hot button issue
that Barbara Yates lives for.
So I guess wre taking
a trip up to Friday Harbor.
Bring me back a T-shirt.
Alex...
National Threat Assessment Command
NTAC. Are you here about Knox?
Got it in one.
It's a small town.
Oliver reappeared
after 21 years in the wind
and he dsn't look a day older.
We connected the dots.
So you two going to take over
my investigation?
Let's just say we'll be
cooperating with your department
until we've established
Knox's guilt or innocence.
I could use some fresh air...
and some cooperation.
His alibi's airtight.
Alibi or not, we're still going
to want to talk to him.
Anything else you can tell us?
You want to know about Knox?
When he was 15, he was
bow hunting with his cousin.
There was an accident.
Knox ended up with
an arrow in his chest.
His cousin panicked and ran.
Knox woke up lying
in a pool of blood
with this arrow sticking
out of his chest.
So l me guess.
He pulled it out,
and he cauterized the wound?
Even better.
He stood up
and walked four miles into town.
Strolled into the emergency room
and checked himself
in at the front desk.
All this with an arrow in his chest.
Years later,
I asked him if it
really happened that way.
He said every word was true.
I told him that must
have been the walk from hell.
"Not at all," he said.
"It was exhilarating."
He felt like he could
have walked forever.
That's Oliver Knox.
* So long ago *
* Another life *
* I can feel your heartbeat *
* It's not a dream *
* Remember us *
* I can see it in your eyes *
* We'll find our place in time *
* Our place in time beyond the sun *
* We'll find our place in time *
* Our place in time to call our own *
Mr. Knox?
Mr. Knox.
We have a few questions to ask you
about the death of Theresa Baron.
Sheriff Conrad call you
or did you jump
to the same conclusion he did?
Not exactly a big jump.
You were on the police
roll out back in '83.
Along with a number of other people.
Did you know Ms. Baron?
No.
She was born after I was abducted.
Look, I know how tempting
the math is on this murder.
I disappear in '83, the killings stop.
Here I am and the poor girl is dead.
We noticed.
And if were in your shoes,
you know, I'd probably
want me to be guilty too.
It would be so convenient.
But I almost feel bad
I can't oblige you.
I did not kill that woman.
Listen, can I get you
some water or something?
I mean, if we're going to talk,
we might as well be civilized
about it, right?
No. No.
We've taken up enough of your time.
Thanks.
Conrad told me the story
about how you got shot
in the chest that day.
Jim does love to talk.
Would you like to see the arrow?
I have it inside.
Th won't be necessary.
How's Kyle?
We don't know yet.
Um, about last night.
The kiss.
That...
and other things.
We've kind of got a lot to talk about.
No, we don't.
Shawn.
You have a gift.
Nikki.
When did you get here?
How's Kyle?
He's still in intensive care,
but Uncle Tommy says he's stable.
I guess whatever they're doing
to him this whole time worked.
For now, anyway.
Listen, I'm starving.
Yowant to come with us
to the cafeteria?
Yeah, I'll bring you a burrito.
Why don't you start
with something easy.
Tell me about your relationship
with your parents.
My parents?
They used to argue about money a lot.
That was before they split up.
They divorced?
Yeah, I was 14.
Do you remember how
that made you feel?
Depressed.
I don't know. Angry, maybe.
Why don't you tell me
about the rest of your family.
They're gone.
I've got a few cousins
outside of Saint Lis
who remember me as a picture
in an old photo album.
Well, my husband
married another woman.
My brother hates that I'm back.
What's the point of this?
Look... you want to help me
Help me find a job.
Tell me what to say
when they ask me how old I am...
or about my work experience,
or-or tell me how to explain
that 50-year gap in my resume.
Everyone says that the world
has-has-has changed for the better,
that people don't judge you
by the color of your skin.
Well, let me tell you something:
I'm still being judged,
and you're sitng there asking me
about my-my relationship
with my parents?
Let's talk about this hostility
that you're manifesting towards me.
Danny, you wanted to see me?
Thanks, Peter.
So, this is where you work, huh?
Yeah. What's up?
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about something, Uncle Tommy.
Is this about Shawn?
How'd you know?
I'm listening.
He, uh... he had a fight at school
a few weeks ago.
He might've killed the guy if
I didn't step in.
What'd he do to him?
Well, it sounds crazy,
but... I don't know.
It was like Shawn was draining the life
out of him somehow...
and I'm not the only one who saw it.
What made you decide to tell me now?
Just thought you should know.
Beautiful, aren't they?
I wonder if that's
where we were.
What's everybody doing here?
What are you doing here?
I don't know. I wanted to see it--
where we came back.
I figured it'd be a good place
to come and think,
you know, clear my head.
Most people come for the conversation.
Well, there's not
a lot of that going on.
Oh, give it time.
Around 11:00, this place becomes
one big group therapy session.
I'm sorry to interrupt...
but I just had to see this myself.
My name's Jordan Collier.
Some of you may recognize me,
and if you do, you know
I'm one of the 4400 just like you.
I'm impressed that you found each other,
and I'm glad that you've come
in support of each other.
And, uh... I'm cold,
and I have to guess that you guys
are cold, too...
...so I want to suggest that we continue
these get-togethers indoors.
I have a place nearby.
It's warm, it's spacious...
and I want to invite all of you
to meet me there
next Thursday afternoon.
You listen to the news.
You read the paper. You hear the talk.
Seems like the entire world
is turning against us.
Well, what are we going to do about it?
We going to give up?
We going to run and hide?
Maybe.
Or maybe... just maybe,
we build a world of our own.
This is the spot where we found
Theresa Baron's body.
We went over everything pretty good.
Yeah, well, we have the toys.
We like to take 'em out of
the box every once in a while.
The killer posed her after
she was dead, right?
There should've been
blood, handprints all over the place.
It rained the day we found the body.
The whole scene was washed clean.
Yeah, but if he dragged her
over here, he had
to grab onto something.
Tom.
I'll be damned.
His name is Philip Lopez.
He did 18 years on an aggravated
rape conviction.
He was paroled six months ago.
We just got confirmation.
His prints were found at the scene
of Theresa Baron's murder.
All right.
Everyone set?
Go.
Lopez!
Tom.
The suicide note says
he killed all nine women.
He wrote that only his "time away"
kept him from doing more.
Do the dates make sense?
Lopez was up here
working as seasonal labor
during the first round of killings.
Guess we owe Oliver Knox an apology.
Excuse me.
Can I get a cranberry juice and seltzer?
And, uh... give me another of
what he's having.
Vengo subito.
Vuolo giaccho con quello?
Excuse me?
Sorry, I, uh...
I'm going to Florence in four days,
and I didn't want to seem like a tourist
when I get there
Oh.
Ice?
Yeah, a little.
I studd, uh, Italian in college.
Really?
Tu sci bella...
come il tramanto di Duomo.
"Beautiful as a sunset over Duomo."
That is very good.
You get an A-plus.
And you get a free round.
Grazie. Hey, Felicia,
can I get a beer?
Need a refill, friend?
Thanks.
Listen, I, uh...
I know we don't know each other,
but I have something
I want to show you.
So, what's her name?
I don't know, but...
I can tell you something about her.
Hello? I'm so sorry I'm late.
Oh, hey, Iris. How did we do today?
I can't come back here.
What? Why?
That child.
I'm sorry. You'll find someone.
I told her that we wouldn't
be seeing each other
for a couple of weeks.
Why... why did
you tell her that?
'Cause she was going to be called
for jury duty.
She thought I was kidding.
A few hours later, her husband called.
And she got a summons for jury duty?
Wellhey, come here.
It's okay, all right?
It's okay.
What are you doing
here so late?
Well, mom said
he was getting worse.
Thă fluid's building
inside his skull again.
Why did they take me
and leave him like this?
We were both on the beach that night.
I don't understand.
I wish I could remember something,
'cause I keep thinking...
think it would help.
Tom said that you were here the night
that Kyle had that jump
in his brain activity.
And he was getting better,
and now he's dying.
Shawn, did you do something to him?
Shawn, tell me.
Just talk to me and tell me...
Aunt Linda, no, I didn't do anything.
Please...
I told Uncle Tommy, and
I'm telling you, oy?
I got to go.
I wish we could talk
to a doctor about it.
And say what? "My baby
may be some kind of alien,
and by the way,
I know what it's thinking"?
Yeah, all that'll do
is get me thrown
right back into quarantine.
I was there today
to register our new address.
Oh, thank you for doing that.
I can't stand going back there.
I ran into Gary Branskul.
He had the bed next to mine.
He told me about some get-together
Jordan Collier's throwing.
Hey, Jordan Collier.
He's the-the hotel guy.
Yeah. Turns out he's one of us.
Yeah, we should go.
Richard, come on.
You can't tell me teenagers didn't
make out in 1951.
Yeah, in a parked car by the lake.
Ohin a parked car by the lake.
That's very cute.
Let me tell you something...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Are you crazy?
Get out of the road!
I killed them.
I killed them all.
I killed them all.
Hands... hands up.
Keep your hands up.
Her name was Gayle Keating.
She worked at a local video store.
They found her body in
Frick Park this morning.
Her blood was all over him.
He spoke for five minutes straight
when we first brought him in.
Confessed to Gayle's death
and the other nine murders.
Hasn't said a word since.
Philip Lopez killed Theresa Baron.
He said so in his suicide note.
We found her shirt
in his apartment, his prints...
I know, but this morning,
Charlie Staley confessed
to the same murder.
And they both claim to be behind
the original round of killings?
Yeah, only Charlie's 39.
He was five years old
when the first death happened.
And we can eliminate Lopez
as a suspect in the original
murders as well.
How do you figure that?
checked Lopez's prison records.
He's left-handed.
According to the autopsy reports
in the '80s,
the Friday Harbor killer
was right-handed.
So, Lopez kills one girl,
Staley kills the other,
and neither one of them
committed the original crimes?
Why would they confess to murders
they couldn't possibly have committed?
Pieces don't quite fit together, do they?
Until you add Knox into the puzzle.
He disappears, the killings stop.
He came back, they started again.
So, let's say
Knox is involved somehow.
That means what, he's...
he's forcing these men
to do his murders for him?
Could be.
The question is how.
I mean, why would he want
more than one person
to admit to the original crimes?
One confession, we might stop digging,
but two - it just gets our attention.
Well, maybe he can't control
everything they do.
What if Knox can force
people to kill?
But only by convincing them
that they really are
the Friday Harbor killers.
In for one murder, in for them all.
Good, good.
Hi. Welcome.
1969, huh?
Well, the good news
is your bell bottoms are back in yle.
Hi.
So, there's this one guy--
I was just talking to him--
and he was gone for 40 years,
and he came back
and picked everything up
without missing a beat.
And then there's me.
I'm gone for three years,
and I come back,
and it's like my whole life
has fallen apart,
everything's different...
I know Shawn, look, the thing to remember
is that most of us feel
the same way you do.
Well, some of us are
more different than others,
if you know what I mean.
I'm not sure I do.
Okay, I had this fight
with a guy at school,
and I know it's going
to sound crazy...
I really can't hear
the specifics right now.
Not yet, anyway.
I have a lot of interviews
over the next few weeks,
and I have to be able to deny
what I need to.
Look, I, I know you're feeling
confused right now,
and I can't blame you.
But it sounds to me
like you've been given a gift.
That's, uh, that's what Nikki called it.
Well, Nikki's right, whoever she is.
And about this gift--
don't let scare you.
You will find the right way to use it.
Okay.
Well, what can I do for you
this afternoon...Lily, '93?
Don't worry, it's not a line.
Though I do have to say
you're the most attractive abductee
I've met all afternoon.
I'm Jordan Collier.
I'm throwing this party.
Oh. Nice to meet you.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Do I detect a little romance brewing
among the 4400?
You have a good eye.
Well, I'm just happy you two
are getting something
positive out of all this.
You're Jordan Collier?
Yes. See, he's not afraid of me.
I, I'm a little lightheaded.
It's hot.
Yeah, I should sit down.
Uh, why don't I find you a seat, huh?
I'll get you some water.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You want me
to, uh, call a doctor or...?
No, I'm not sick.
It'll pass.
Here you go.
Well, that good.
If you're not sick, then what's, uh...?
It's just morning sickness.
You're pregnant.
Uh... first trimester.
Well, that explains it
Congratulations to both of you.
Did I say
something wrong?
I-It's a little
more complicated than that.
Richard's not the father.
I-I wasn't pregnant
when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.
Strange, huh?
Well, interesting is more like it. Uh...
Kind of makes you wonder
what the hell they have in mind--
whoever took us, I mean.
You haven't told your counselor
about this, have you?
We haven't told anyone.
Well, I'd keep it that way for now.
Look, how are you guys managing?
You have everything you need?
Yeah, everything except a job.
I was a pilot in the Air Force.
Supposed to be drawing a pension, but...
that hasn't come through yet.
I've applied for flight instructor jobs.
I even filed a application
with Seattle P.D.
But every time they find out
I'm one of the 4400...
the job suddenly goes away.
Well, look, I may have something
you'd be interested in.
Doesn't involve flying,
but given ur background
in the military, uh...
My foundation has an opening
in the security department.
Foundation?
For the 4400.
Anyway, if you're interested,
why don't you come by
tomorrow and see me?
I'll be there.
Good.
The rash of violence
involving the 4400 continues,
with sources telling us tonight
that Homeland Security
is investigating a possible connection
between the Friday Harbor murders
and an undisclosed returnee.
That hypocritical, self-righteous,
irresponsible bitch.
Oh, I-I take it he doesn't like her show.
He doesn't like her.
When we were with the FBI,
she disclosed the name of a
juror in a RICO prosecution.
Judge declared a mistrial.
Three years of work down the drain.
You know, she blindsided me once.
That is not going to happen again.
Tom Baldwin.
Yeah, sure.
I see.
We'll be there.
That was Conrad.
He got another letter.
"I decide who lives and who dies.
My judgment is final,
and more verdicts are coming."
The date's clipped from
this morning's paper.
It couldn't have been composed
by Charlie Staley--
not from jail.
You telling us this letter's
from the Friday Harbor killer?
It's genuine.
He describes wound patterns
on the original victims.
We kept that private.
If you really believe
Knox is involved in this,
why the hell is he out
there walking around?
Let's pick him up right now.
We can't do that.
The bottom line is
we need to know exactly
how he's connected to these murders
before we can bring him in.
So, what do we do--
wait for another girl
to turn up dead?
I think we can do better than that.
That's $27.75 - your change.
Thank you.
Who's this?
Let me tell you
something about her.
Her name's Felicia
and she works over at the bar...
W or maybe a tax audit,lling
but I didn't think I'd merit
an invitation into the belly of the beast.
Consider it a tribute to
the size of your bully pulpit.
I'm flattered.
Don't be.
DC is calling for your head.
I want you to dial back on the 4400.
Not going to happen.
I'm a journalist;
I answer only to my viewers.
Don't you hide behind
freedom of the press.
What you do isn't journalism;
it's shouting "fire" in a crowded theater,
and you're going to stop
before the stampede begins.
Yeah.
You have a really strong face.
Seriously, Dennis,
you should come on my show.
You're getting in the way
of my job, Barbara.
And if you're going to continue
interfering
with Department of Homeland Security,
I'd advise you to tread lightly.
And what are you going to do,
disappear me?
I asked for your cooperation.
And I've chosen not to give it.
Fair enough.
Don't forget to get your parking
validated on the way out.
This healthcare plan is incredible.
Yeah, well, the maternity coverage
should provide for all yo doctors' visits
and hospital care once the baby's born.
Mr. Collier, I don't...
I don't know what to say.
Say you'll take the job?
I'm sorry, one moment;
I have to take this.
Yeah, Len.
Oh, good, good.
The whole property?
Excellent. 26 million.
Yes, I want you to lose.
Well, don't worry about
the board of directors, Len.
They voted me back in as CEO
when I returned, didn't they?
I will handle them.
Call me when it's done. Okay.
Real estate deals-- they're
never over till they're over.
So are you going to come
to work for me or not?
I can start tomorrow.
Mr. Ryland - Phil Gibson.
This is an honor.
Uh, Barbara will be very disappointed
she wasn't able to meet with you herself.
Actually, I prefer to speak to you.
Great. First, just let me
say right off the top, sir,
that any information that
you give us about the 4400
will never be traced back to you.
I'm glad to hear that
because I have something
very important to pass on.
Great. Do you mind if I tape this, sir?
Quick and simple.
I want Barbara Yates's
coverage of the 4400 to stop.
What do you mean "stop"?
I mean it ends.
She stops covering the story, period.
Uh, listen, uh, Mr. Ryland,
Barbara has sole ahority
over her editorial content.
It's Barbara. Barbara says what Barbara wants.
There's nothing I can do about it.
You're her producer - produce.
I don't think you know what it's like
to work in this business these days.
We're not Walter Cronkite here.
You want to talk about the old days?
In the old days, I would need a warrant
to tap all your phones,
to freeze all your assets,
and to prevent you
from ever being a passenger
on any airline in the world.
But like you say,
it's not the old days anymore.
Now you've worked for Barbara Yates
for a long time, since the beginning,
and I'm guessing that you know
where the bodies are buried.
Draw me a map.
You're just afraid
my dad will kick your ass
if I come home smelling like beer.
Evil cousin Shawn.
Corrupter of the innocent.
Help!
Help me, Shawn! Shawn, help me!
Oh, my God.
Excuse me.
I-I lost my dog.
Could you help me find him?
I haven't seen him.
He's a-a wirehaired terrier.
His name's Boss.
I haven't seen him.
Could you let me by?
This isn't funny.
I'll scream.
Yes, you will.
Don't move!
Felicia has to die!
She has to!
This man, what did he say
to you, Mr. Mitchell?
You've been following me?
No. Actually, we were following Knox.
You know, I really like
the composition of this shot.
It's nice cozy symmetry.
Now, what did he say to you?
You keep at him.
We'll bring in Knox,
sit him down next to his friend.
See what they have
to say to each other.
Knox! Open up!
Tom!
Knox!
Tell me the police have someone
at the girl's house.
She refused an escort.
She's leaving for Italy
in the morning.
Hello?
Hello?
Excuse me.
I-I lost my dog.
Can you help me find him?
He's a wirehaired terrier.
His name's Boss.
Somebody, help me!
Stay back!
Let her go! Let her go, Knox!
Knox, get away from her,
or I'll shoot!
I think you break my nose.
Stay down!
Hey, you got me all wrong.
Let me tell you a story...
Not a word. Not a word.
Not a word.
...damn serial killer.
This guy murders eight people
before he's abducted.
They send him back,
and he picks up right where he left off.
In '83, Knox was your
garden-variety psychopath.
They sent him back enhanced.
Big difference.
Well, it makes whoever took
him sound pretty nasty.
They also sent back Shawn.
And Maia.
Yes, I know, Tom.
And for that, I'd like to thank them.
But it all seems so random.
Maybe.
Until you start to look
at the bigger picture.
Orson Bailey kills Adam Kensington.
Revenge murder - open-and-shut.
Carl Morrisey is a well-intentioned,
but hapless vigilante
o ends up dead.
Like I said, random.
Yeah, but we know that
Adam Kensington's company
was perpetrating a massive
fraud on the public.
And now we've learned,
since Carl Morrisey's death,
his neighbors have formed a watch committee
that's helping to protect Bradley Park.
Anyone starting to see a pattern?
What, you're talking about
some kind of ripple effect?
Diana Skouris to the head of the class.
The incidents themselves
are just catalysts for change.
But positive change
in these two cases.
Wait a minute. What?!
Who-whoever sent them back,
you're saying they planned
for these changes to take place?
What about the Knox killings?
There's nothing positive there.
Or maybe we have seen the ripples yet.
Excuse me.
Hey, I have something
I want to tell you.
Hey, I have something
I want to tell you!
Police aren't saying
who is behind the release
of this closely guarded secret.
A document containing the names
and the current addresses of all the 4400
has appeared on the Internet,
and is now posted on more than 20 sites.
Authorities aren't confirming the leak,
but their efforts to shut down the sites
with an emergency injunction
suggest the list is genuine.
We will have more on this
breaking story as it develops.
What are you doing here, Shawn?
Kyle?
How long...
...have I been in the dark?
Previously on The 4400:
We're not sure what's just happened.
There appears to be something out there.
The light is gone,
and, and thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.
Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin.
You two will be one of the teams
that's responsible for investigating
what happened to the returnees.
We're letting them go.
We're letting them go?
We don't have
a legal right to hold them.
Shawn!
Why disappear
a little girl from the 1940s,
hold her for 60 years,
and then send her back
with the ability to
predict the future?
What were they thinking?
"They"? We don't even know
if there is a "they."
Whoever sent them back, you're saying
they, they planned
for these changes to take place?
You're talking about
some kind of ripple effect.
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.
You haven't told your counselor
about this, have you?
My foundation has an opening
in the security dertment.
If you're intereed,
why don't you come by
tomorrow and see me?
I'll be there.
Despite nationwide protests,
Homeland Security refuses
to divulge the names or the whereabouts
of the 4400 living here
in the United States.
What you do isn't journalism.
You're getting ithe way
of my job, Barbara.
Well, what are you going to do,
disappear me?
About last night...
The kiss?
And other things.
We've kind of got a lot to talk about.
I was reviewing Kyle's EEG readout.
It seems last Thursday night,
he had a momentary burst
of increased brain activity.
Shawn, did you do something to him?
Talk to me.
How long have I been in the dark?
Kyle?
So far, the test results
have been inconclusive.
But there must be something
we're missing.
People don't simply
regain consciousness
after three years in a coma
for no reason.
Honestly, we don't care
why this happened, right, Tom?
We're just glad to have Kyle back.
You've been poking and prodding him
for more than a week.
When can we take him home?
I don't see why you can't do it now.
That's wonderful.
Well, there is something else.
Patients like Kyle
often have difficulty
adjusting to their awakenings.
They do best in environments
as similar as possible
to what those they were in
before their comas.
In every detail.
The places, the people...
Hey, come on.
Why are we here?
We thought you'd be happier at home.
Then why take me here?
Kyle, this is your home.
And this is your room, Kyle.
It's just the way you left it.
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoawhoa.
I got you.
This isn't my room.
And this isn't my house.
Kyle, Kyle.
Kyle?
Wha-what are you looking for, buddy, huh?
What are you looking for?
Maybe we can help.
Kyle, Kyle, talk to us.
What is he doing?
Whatever it is,
I say we just let him work it out.
But he doesn't recognize
the house, or his room.
Linda, the doctor told us
he'd be disoriented.
I'm glad you're moving back in.
I'll try to stay out of your way
as much as I can.
Yeah.
Oh, come on, Jordan,
aren't you overreacting?
No, I'm not, not at all.
Publishing the names and addresses
of the 4400 - it, it's a crime, Barbara.
It's a violation of the, uh, privacy
of over 4,0 people, and whoever did it
should be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.
So, you're saying
that warning people
that they might be living
next to a public menace
is a crime?
I don't think...
We don't want an
Shawn, it's your uncle.
Let me in.
Uncle Tommy.
Hey, Shawn.
Come to take the to?
Quite a procession out there.
Yup. They started driving by the house
the day my address and
name swed up on the net.
And they haven't stopped since.
Yay for us.
Well, I know this is hard for you, Shawn.
I just... I just stopped by
to say thank you.
You know, we took Kyle home yesterday,
and, um, I'm gteful.
He's doing good, right?
Yeah. He's got a lot of work
ahead of him, but... he's awake.
Aunt Linda-- does she know?
About what I did, I mean?
No, I figured you wouldn't want that.
Truth is, Uncle Tommy...
I don't know what happened.
I put my hands on him,
that's it.
He woke up.
He woke up, and I don't know why.
See, Shawn, this,
this thing that you can do--
whatever it is,
we need to learn more about it.
Well, how? How?
What, I could go
into quarantine again?
They can study me some more?
No, because I'm done with all that--
with the hypnosis and the dream journals
and the counseling sessions.
I hear, I hear you.
But I can be an ally.
Maybe I can help you.
I don't think so, Uncle Tommy.
That was some movie.
Biggest screen I ever saw.
A-d the sound, and all those, uh, uh...
Special effects.
Yes.
So, did you like it?
Not really.
But it sure did look good.
Down!
The genie is definitely out of the bottle
Three different bombings in one day.
Yeah, each targeting the 4400s
whose addresses were made public.
Wait a second.
Pipe bomb, tripwire trigger.
That's about as basic as you can get.
Amateur.
Diana, I just found part of the casing.
Mm-hmm.
It's beautiful.
Shawn's name is on that list.
I had my sister upgrade
her security system, but...
Yeah, I'm worried
about Maia, too.
You ever think about bringing her
back into quarantine
until this blows over?
Yeah, I've thought about it.
I've even talked it over with her.
She started crying.
She wants to stay with me, Tom.
I'm gladt's working out.
Who would have thought?
How's Kyle adjusting
to being back home?
He's still pretty weak.
His memory's a mess,
but he's out of that damn hospital.
What's his doctor think?
He's stunned, just like us.
Look, it's a miracle.
I don't know any other way
of putting it.
What about Shawn?
What about him?
Where was he... when Kyle woke up?
I have no idea.
All three bombs so far were identical
in design and composition.
Pipe casings, tripwire triggers.
I did a chemical analysis
of the explosive.
It's homemade plastique
basically boiled down fr bleach.
You get the recipe on the Internet.
Just like the list of victims.
I'd like to get my hands on
whoever leaked those names.
Come on, Tom.
Who do you think leaked them?
Barbara Yates.
You're ...damn right it was Yates.
It's just her style.
Cheap, inflammatory, and
dangerously irresponsible.
I'll handle Yates.
Meanwhile, I want you two
to back-trace hits
on every website that
published these bomb recipes.
We'll have the results soon.
So will I.
You own this entire complex?
80 homes.
Once we have this place off the ground,
I'm planning developments
in Chicago and in Los Angeles.
I intend to provide a safe haven
for any 4400 in this country
who needs one.
We're opening a little
sooner than I had planned,
but the bombings have made that necessary.
You do think big, don't you?
I'm a businessman.
But I've been given
a second chance to do something
with my life besides make money.
Because right now,
that's just not enough.
Or maybe I'm just
having a mid-life crisis.
93 Tomberra Lane. What do you think?
Oh, they're beautiful.
They're all beautiful.
Well, it's yours.
You'll be our first official residents.
Oh, we can't afford a house right now.
Consider it a gift.
For the two of you, and your new baby.
It's a small world.
You did it, didn't you?
Kyle waking up?
That was you.
You fixed him,
just like you fixed my hand.
Have you told Danny?
No, and I don't want you to, either.
But maybe if he knew
what you d, he'd...
stop thinking of you as...
monster?
I've been doing some thinking...
This thing between Danny and
me... maybe it was a mistake.
I don't want to hear this.
It's not your fault.
I mean that.
Danny's sweet.
I like him, but...
that's all.
Well, he more than likes you.
I know.
Dennis Ryland?
Yeah.
How are you doing?
I'm Warren Lytell.
I believe Home Sec in DC
mentioned I was coming.
Oh, yeah, they warned me.
Right. Well, they're never happy.
They seem to think your department
needs to be a little more aggressive
investigating the 4400.
I'm just here to see
if I can't nudge things along.
The authority to review
all 4400 case files,
access to all meetings
and briefing sessions,
permission to with field
agents at your discretion.
It's a pretty broad mandate.
Well, they're looking at five murders,
three unsolved bombings,
Barbara Yates bashing us
all over the airwaves.
It seems to them you could
use a little bit of help.
I suppose it could look that way
from a conference room in DC.
I gotta tell you, Dennis,
it looks that way
from everywhere except
this glass tower of yours.
I have a thousand returnees
within 75 miles of Seattle.
I've got about two dozen agents
to ride herd on all of them.
You want to help me?
Get me some more personnel.
You want to help me?
Get DC off my back.
But you're not really here to
help me, are you, Warren?
No. I'm here to clean up your mess.
The hell you are. Where'd they
recruit you from? FBI? NSA?
It doesn't matter where I came from.
How long you been in public service?
15, 16 years?
And suddenly you got a shot
at a command of your own.
Now you come and take it
from me... if you can.
Kyle, what's going on?
They're lies.
What do you mean?
These pictures. I don't belong in them.
These people. I don't know them.
No, no, no, of course you do.
Look, wait, wait, wait.
Look, th is you at the zoo
with Grandma Fran when you were eight.
Remember?
And, and, uh, and this is your
birthday party when you turned ten.
You remember George?
He was my friend.
That's right. That's right.
That's right. And Freddy,
Freddy, you have to remember Freddy.
Freddy was over here all the time
when you were little, remember?
Bugs Bunny.
That's right.
Exactly, the kid was crazy
about cartoons.
Don't, don't.
Don't touch me.
I'm sorry. I-I'm trying to help.
It's not my memory. You're my father.
I recognize you, but I
don't know who you are.
It's like you' a stranger.
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.
Kyle, look. Just look at me.
Just look ate.
Just look at me. I need... I need...
Just look at me.
I need... I need help.
I want to help you.
I want to.
Why can't you help me?
I'm trying. I'm trying.
I'm trying.
Yeah the ripple effect.
What about it?
Every time we stop by the Theory Room,
you and Marco are always
talking about how every case
we work, there's a ripple effect.
Yeah, every case
but the Friday Harbor murders.
But what if these bombings
are that ripple?
The thing we couldn't figure out
about Knox is he went
from killing prostitutes
before his disappearance
to killing just random
women once he came back.
What if they weren't random?
at's interesting.
Yeah, we should start
looking into Knox's victims.
See if we can find out
some kind of connection there.
I can't condone these bombings,
but I do understand the fear
that motivates them.
The easiest way to stop
these acts of violence
is to put the 4400
somewhere out of harm's way,
someplace safe for them and for us.
Now, I know to some of you that
may sound harsh, heartless even.
And I assure you I don't mean it to be.
Just as I assure you
that there are those
among the 4400 who would jump
at the chance to find sanctuary...
Truck's ready to go.
Won't be happy till we torch them all.
They can all burn in hell.
Hey, I was listening to that.
I'm sick of listening to it.
She's on our side, man.
That woman is a parasite, all right?
She doesn't give a damn about us,
or that our sister was murdered
by one of those 4400 bastards, okay?
Why don't you go unload
the fertilizer, huh?
And leave the air filter on.
These damn fumes are killing me.
Kyle? Kyle?
Hey. Mm. Hey.
It's good to see you, man.
What are you doing...
what are you doing
sitting out here in the rain?
What are you staring at?
Listen, you're looking pretty good.
The way your folks talk,
I thought you'd be some kind of zombie.
They w't leave me alone.
Asking me questions,
staring at me all the time.
They're just glad to have you back.
My mom did the exact same thing to me.
My parents had you
come here, didn't they?
To try to make me remember?
No, Kyle. Hey...
I'm going inside.
I've got reading to do.
You've got reading to do?
Kyle.
Comen, man, I just gotere.
Look at you.
I could have bought a car in my
day for the price of this suit.
How's it going?
Ah, we got a lot of work to do.
Five families moved in today.
Seven more by the end of the week.
Got a half a mile
of property line to shore up.
The fences are too short,
overhanging trees along the perimeter.
Along the perimeter?
Mm-hmm.
Well, as long as you're on the job
I feel safe, and so does the baby.
Two happy residents. That's a start.
It has been a crazy day. No.
Myssistant's out.
My phone sheet is, it's a mile long.
I never got to the end of it.
Anyway, I...
Ms. Yates,
Dennis Ryland would
like to speak with you.
Dennis. What a pleasant surprise.
Well, this is a bit
theatrical, don't you think?
Read this.
What is it?
It's a story. A good one.
About the 4400?
No, about a TV talking head
that was involved in an automobile
accident last year.
A hit and run, actually.
It was really ugly.
The pedestrian she hit
died instantly.
It was a shame.
Just 40 years old, father of three.
No wonder she spent so much
money covering it up.
So, you blackmailing me, Dens?
I shut up about the 4400
and this envelope goes away
in a vault somewhere?
Not good enough, Barbara.
What do you want me to do?
It's too late for you to do anything.
I gave you a chance and you refused.
Steve Smizik from the DA's office
wants to talk to you.
He's gonna charge you with
vehicular manslaughter,
among other things.
Look, face it.
Shutting me up
is not gonna make the 4400 disappear
from the headlines.
And eventually, they will
cost you your job.
We'll see.
Good-bye, Barba.
Do you really think
this is the wisest move
to make under the circumstances,
Mr. Collier?
All these 4400s
in the same place?
You're a hell of a target.
There are always potential dangers,
but that's why I hired the security team.
Mr. Tyler, I know you're trying
to protect your family,
but you have to realize
that by staying here
you could be putting
urself in serious danger.
Maybe.
But you know, I was born in 1922...
in Missouri.
And my skin was as black then
as it is now.
So I've had to worry about fire bombings
and lynchings and beatings
my entire life.
If there's anything I learned, it's this:
eventually, a man's got to take a stand.
I'm making mine right here.
* To your old friend *
* You don't want to know *
* How do you then *
* Come back *
* To your new friend *
* When you don't nt to leave? *
* Crazy times ahead *
* Kee me running every day... *
Because he had a sprained ankle.
The other side.
Maia.
How'd you do today?
Miss Skouris, can we talk, please?
Well, give us a sec, can you?
I know I'm late again...
Please just understand.
I'm afraid you can't bring Maia
back to school anymore.
It's... We have to consider
the safety of the other students.
Has Maia been a problem?
No, not at all.
Maia's lovely.
But it's the bombings.
With Maia's name on that list,
we can't risk having her here at school.
I'm sorry.
I understand.
I'm sorry, Maia.
We'll, we'll find someplace else.
I promise.
It'll be okay.
No, it's not okay.
It's wrong.
No, I mean...
Someone's coming
who'll make everything better.
We just have to wait a little longer.
Oh. It got too warm.
Come on, let look pretty.
Well, don't you want
to look pretty?
That's better.
Is that a blasting cap?
It's a commercial detonator,
which means it'll be
a lot easier to trace
than a bottle of bleach.
We need to send it to the lab.
We need serial numbers, lot numbers.
A purchaser would be nice.
What do you have on the victim?
Uh... Mary Deneville, 27 years old.
The flower shop is her father's.
She disappeared in 1999,
but picked up her life
right where she left off.
Until today.
Are the 4400 that frightening to people?
I mean, are we just too close,
so we don't see it?
Something like this isn't fear.
This is hate, pure and simple.
Baldwin.
Right now?
What?
We have to go in.
Nikki?
Shawn.
There's something I need to tell you.
I know.
I saw you and Danny talking yesterday.
I just... want to make one thing clear.
Me breaking up with Danny
has nothing to do with you.
Okay?
Okay.
Did you ever feel like you just...
wanted to get away
from your life for awhile?
I did that for three years.
I don't recommend it.
You know what I mean.
Yeah.
Find a quiet place
where you can pretend that...
things are simple,
that nobody's angry at you,
or hurt... or sad.
I know just the spot.
Come on, I'll take you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Ok.
I've been studying your case files.
Now, you're the first investigative
team that I've talked to,
but it seems like you two are the
right place to begin.
Where do you want to start--
Orson Bailey, Oliver Knox?
How about Maia Rutledge?
Age eight, disappeared in '46.
Well, what about her?
Well, it says in here
that her foster parents
returned her to quarantine,
no reason given.
Then there's all these reports
of her making predictions--
ones that come true.
Next thing you know,
she's been removed from quarantine
by one of our field agents.
I believe it goes on to say
"for further study."
But you haven't filed any
other reports, though, have you?
All of this was approved by Ryland.
I, uh, I don't see what the problem is.
Next case - Shawn Farrell, age 17,
disappeared in April of 2001.
It's a little thin, isn't it, Tom?
Why don't you accuse us
of whatever it is you're going
to accuse us of
and let us get back to work?
You two are good field agents,
but it was a mistake
to allow two people
with such obvious conflicts of interest
to remain on the 4400 investigation.
This is not a conflict of interest.
It is a unique perspective.
It is a window into these people's lives.
You have a gang task force,
you want people on
it who know gangs.
Same thing here.
We know the 4400 better than
any other agents in the country.
That's why we belong on these cases.
That's a nice spin.
Is this what Ryland thinks?
Is that who you're after - Ryland?
You know what's ironic?
The Northwest Division
used to be a backwater.
It was given to Ryland like
a pat on the back
for a career of good service.
A nice quiet place where he could ride out
his last few years before retirement.
But his free ride ended
the night the 4400
showed up by that lake.
Now, there's going
to be a change around here
whether you like it or not.
You can either be part of it,
or you can get swept aside.
Lily Moore is here to see you.
Send her in.
Lily.
What can I do for you?
Um... yeah.
Chilean sea bass?
Tenderloin medallions?
Lobster sushi?
Jordan, I-I just asked
if I could use the common area
for our support group meeting.
I didn't mean for you to... cater it
like a black tie dinner.
Lily, people want to eat,
whether they're wearing tuxedos
or not.
It's going to be a really emotional night.
I mean, these people are like me.
Their mily reunions
didn't turn out as planned.
It's all paid for.
Did anyone ever tell you
you're a bit of a control freak?
Once or twice.
Or that the way you throw money at people
might make them question
what you want in return?
That sounds awfully serious.
Lily, if I've done anything
to make you uncomfortable...
Oh, it's just, um...
you go so far out of your y
to make sure I'm taken care of.
You give me more than I've thought about
or... asked for or neede
You know I'm in love with Richard, right?
Lily Moore, you are a blunt woman,
and I find that attractive,
which I know was not your intent.
Look, why would I try
to break up you and Richard?
One, I smart enough to know I'd fail.
Two... I just tould never do that.
Lily, thanks for coming by.
And I hope your support group
enjoys the lobster.
Yeah, it's the William Wayne
Construction Company.
That's who bought the blasting caps.
Okay, good.
Check their employee list
with the names we found
from the Knox case.
Yeah, I'm already onto it.
I'll call you back
if I find your ripple.
Thanks.
How is he?
You better see for yourself.
What are you doing, buddy?
I'm looking.
For what?
For me.
This is the spot?
Yup. Me and 4,399
of my closest friends
popped out of a ball of light
right about here.
It's so pretty.
I wonder why they sent you back here.
I mean, why not on the White House lawn,
or... in the middle of Times Square?
I don't know.
Maybe they just appreciate
a good view.
You think?
I have no idea.
You're such a jerk.
What, you're just
figuring that out now?
Hey, let me see this.
What are you doing?
Doctor's follow-up. Just...
It looks good.
* I want to make you feel beautiful... *
I keep thinking you're still 14.
* I know I tend to get so insecure *
I'm not.
I know.
* It doesn't matter anymore *
* I don't mind spending every day *
* Out on your corner in the pouring rain *
* Look for the girl with the broken smile *
* And ask her if she wants to stay a while *
* And she will *
* Be loved *
* And she will *
* Be loved*
* And she will *
* Be loved *
* And she will *
* Be loved... *
Tom? I found something.
What do you got?
Gone.
We got fertilizer.
And tire tracks.
They got a truck bomb.
The tire prints matched up
to phone company service trus.
So, we pulled their personnel records
and found one Dean Keating.
Keating?
As in Gayle Keating,
Friday Harbor murder victim?
Dean's her older brother.
Not only that,
Gayle's younger brother Glen
works construction,
and on his last job, the company
wound up short two dozen blasting caps.
So, one of the returnees
kills their sister,
and these guys get their revenge.
Yeah, and the 4400 go from being a threat
to being sympathetic victims.
The ripple effect.
All right,
put out an A.P.B. on the Keating's truck,
and you better not let that truck
get to where it's going.
Come on, come on, where are you?
Mr. Tyler, we're
looking for a truck mb.
You need to be on high alert.
Understood. Thanks.
We're running out of tim
There - truck number 85.
That vehicle's assigned
to Dean Keating,
and it's headed north on...
Aurora...
heading into Richmond Highlands.
We need a list of all the 4400s
in Richmond Highlands.
There's only one 4400 living in that area.
It's Tom's nephew.
Tom, hold up.
Operations, patch me through
to that phone number again.
This is the Farrell residence.
We're noin.
You know the drill.
Susan, Shawn, Danny, it's me again.
If you can hear this,
get out of the house now!
Is anyone there?
There it is, the number 85.
Get us down, now!
Put your hands
where I can see them! Now!
Get out of theruck!
Get your hands where we can see them!
What the hell? Shut up! Stay down!
You're not Keating.
Where's Dean Keating?!
He didn't come into work today.
No explosives!
The truck's clean, Tom.
They switched vans!
He's not Keating!
Come on! Let's go!
We got the wrong van.
Recheck all principal targets.
Report anything suspicious.
We got a twelve-foot step van
parked near Collier's housing complex.
No plates, new paint job.
That's what the phone company uses.
Patch us through to Collier's development.
Use any line you can find.
Nothing. All the phones are dead.
Code red, main gate.
There they are.
Get me over there.
Go!
Set it! Go!
Hands on your head!
Hands on your head!
Down, down, wn, down!
On your stomach, now!
You're being arrested as a terrorist.
You will be treated as an enemy combatant.
You do not have the right to remain silent.
You do not have the right
to an attorney.
And whatever you say will
damn sure be used against you.
Dr. Mayhew?
I'm Warren Lytel from Homeland Security.
I need to ask you a few questions
about Kyle Baldwin.
Tom? Tom, you have to come.
You have to come quick.
Just come on.
Kyle...
what are you doing?
I know what's wrong with me.
I finay understand.
What is it, Kyle?
Tell me.
There's only onexplanation.
Why I remember everything,
but can't feel anything.
Why all the people in my life
seem like strangers.
They're not the strangers.
I am.
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.
Previously on The 4400:
We're not sure
what's just happened.
There pears
to be something out there.
The light is gone
and thousands of people have
just suddenly appeared.
Diana Skouris,
Tom Baldwin.
You two will be one
of the teams
that's responsible
for inveigating
what happened to the returnees.
We're letting them go.
We're letting them go?
You don't ha
a legal right to hold them.
Dennis Ryland,
I'm Warren Lytell.
I believe Home Sec
in D.C. mentioned I was coming.
I'm here to clean up your mess.
The hell you are.
Now, there's gonna be
a change around here.
You can either be part of it,
or you can get swept aside.
I intend to provide a safe haven
for any 4400 in this coury
who needs one.
You'll be our first
official residents.
You know I'm in love
with Richard, right?
Why would I try to break up
you and Richard?
long as you're on the job,
I feel safe,
and so does the baby.
Two happy residents.
That's a start.
w 'bout Maia Rutledge, age eight,
disappeared in '46.
And there's all these reports of her
making predictions,
ones that come true.
Next thing you know, shs been removed
from quarantine
by one oour field agents.
I'm afraid you can't bring Maia
back to school anymore.
We have to consider the safety
of the other students.
It'll be okay.
No, it's not okay.
Somebody's coming who'll make
everything better.
Next case, Shawn Farrell, age 17.
Disappeared in April
of 2001.
It's a little thin.
Me breaking up with Danny
has nothing to do with you.
Okay.
I need to ask you a few questions
abt Kyle Baldwin.
I don't know what happened.
I put my hands on him, that's it.
He woke up.
Don't touch me!
You're my father.
I recognize you,
but I don'know who you are.
What are you doing, buddy?
I'm looking.
For what?
For me.
I finally understand.
They're not the strangers.
I am.
I'm not Kyle Baldwin.
Kyle?
I'm not Kyle.
Well, then who are you?
I don't know.
I need more screens.
Okay.
Your son is experiencing
a severe dissociative disorder.
Now, it's not uncommon
for newly awakened coma patients.
He feels disconnected
from his memories, his personality.
Yeah, well, we knew
when he woke up
there'd be a period of adjustment,
but the kid doesn't even know
who he is.
I know this is frustrating
for you and Linda,
but you did the right thing
bringing him back here.
Yeah.
So what now? More tests?
We need to do another cranial MRI.
They'll be here in an hour
to take him back downstairs.
Look, I know this is difficult, Tom.
But Kyle's come this far.
We can't give up now.
I think I've got the exact change.
Here you go.
Hello, cutie.
Thanks.
How long have you known that man?
Tony? Oh, about two years.
He's nice.
He's very nice.
Why do you say that?
He's going to fall in love today.
Tony? My God, good for him.
It's not with me, is it?
Nope.
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Is there something else, Maia?
How long am I going
to be like this?
Like what?
I don't want to know things
before they happen.
I want to be normal,
like I used to be.
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
Besides, I mean, you know,
who's normal anyway?
You are.
Ha. You want to know a secret?
Normal people, like me...
they just wish
they were special like you.
The television, put it back on.
Kyle, when you came home,
you spent all that time
looking through your books.
Then the maps, now the TV.
Why don't you tell us what
you're looking for, huh?
Maybe we can help you look, too.
You should go home and get some rest.
I'm not aving him.
All right.
I'll go grab some stuff.
I'll be back in a half hour, okay?
Mm-hmm.
What are you doing?
Mrs. Baldwin...
You leave him alone!
Who are you people?
I'm calling security.
That won't be necessary.
My name is Agent Warren Lytell.
I work with your husband.
I don't give a damn
who you work with.
Leave him alone!
Tell Tom I figured iout.
I know where
I have to be.
Mrs. Baldwin, don't worry.
He's gonna be safe.
The government's gon be
supervising himedical care
from now on.
* So long ago *
* Another life *
* I can feel your heartbeat *
* It's not a dream *
* Remember us *
* I can see it in your eyes *
* We'll find our place in time *
* Our place in time beyond the sun *
* We'll find our place in time *
* Our place in time to call our own... *
You snatched that kid from a hospital?
What were you thinking?!
He's the only witness to an abduction.
He could have some valuable information.
Kyle Baldwin
can't remember his own name.
Then we'll help him remeer.
His mother's upset. It's understandable.
The family's been through a lot.
But D.C. sent me here to get some resu...
Tom!
Where's my son?
Whoa. Get your hands off me, Baldwin.
I swear to God.
I'll ask you one more time.
Ryland, you want to give me some help?
It's a tough call.
Where's Kyle?!
All right, Tom.
You made your point. Put the gun away.
Dennis, Dennis.
Tom, put the gun away.
You should have let me pull the trigger.
Don't think I wasn't tempted
But shooting Lytell
is not gonna get Kyle back.
Maybe not,
but it'd make me feel
a hell of a lo better.
Damn it!
What I don't understand is why Kyle?
Why didn't they go after Shawn?
Because our doctors
have been over Shawn
dozens of times.
Kyle's new territory for 'em.
New territory?
That's my son
you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
Can't you call D.C.?
What in the hell good would that do?
It was D.C. that put Lytell here
the first place.
They're backing his play.
So what then? We do nothing?
I didn't say that. We'll get Kyle back.
When?
For Christ's sake, I don't know.
I just heard an hour ago.
I don't know where Lytell put him.
No, not good enough, Dennis.
No. I'm not gonna sit around
while you play phone tag
with some Beltway bureaucrat.
I'm getting my son.
Hey, Tom. Get your hands off me.
Tom!
We go back a long way.
If you try to go around me on this,
none of it matters.
I know.
Tom, what the hell happened
between you and Lytell?
Ask Ryland.
Tom.
Tom!
What?!
If you're in trouble, I need to know.
Why?
'Cause I might be able to help.
Diana, just stay
out of it, all right?
Drive the car.
Blood work looks fine.
The Rh factor levels are normal,
and your calcium's okay.
So, how do you feel, Lily?
A little tired sometime
Well, that's to be expected.
Now, where was I?
Oh, right.
I'm gonna have to draw
some more amniotic fluid.
Why?
Is something wrong?
What kind of genetic anomaly?
All I know is she wants to grow
one of the baby's chromosomes
in the lab.
It'll be okay.
It's gonna be a beautiful 18 holes.
Either of you play golf?
Oh, I'm afraid not.
at's too bad.
Listen,
Jordan, about that doctor
you sent us to.
Roxanne Kern.
She's the best OB-GYN
in the Pacific Northwest.
You're in good hands.
So, how'd that support group
meeting go the other night?
Yeah, it, it went well.
Thank you.
Nobody complained about the catering?
I have to admit
the, um, lobster sushi was a great idea.
You see?
You just have to trust me.
This girlfriend of yours
has quite an imagination.
She actually thought I was trying
to steal her away from you.
You believe that?
Uh, not really.
I like your confidence.
You see?
You were worried about nothing.
I wasn't worried.
* Oh... yeah, three to one *
* Lights, camera, transaction... *
We've got to tell him.
I'll do it. It should be me.
When?
Soon. I can't take all
this sneaking around.
Besides, I miss seeing you.
I miss you, too.
* Come one, come all into 1984... *
Yeah, but you suspected
that Shawn had these abilities
from the day of his coming home party,
and you never told me.
I...
Thanks for sharing.
I never told Linda, either.
Yeah, but you're divorcing
Linda - I'm your partner.
Yeah, I know.
When we were first assigned to the 4400,
you we calling them
disease vectors and viruses.
I know what I was calling them,
but have you noticed
any change in me lately,
maybe because, I don't know,
I have one of them
living in my apartment?
All right, point taken.
Because if the situati
were reversed,
I would have told you.
I know. I heard you, all right?
Can we continue the reprimand later?
Fine.
Fine.
Now, what are we gonna do about Kyle?
We?
Of course, we.
We are gonna go find him
and bring him home.
Then we'd better get to work.
I'm sorry Mr. Collier's not available right now.
I'll have him return your call
as soon as he gets in.
Thank you, Dr. Kern.
Dr. Kern, the OB-GYN?
Mm-hmm.
Jordan about to have a baby?
I wouldn't know.
Ah.
Here's the, uh, security logs
he asked to see.
I'll put them on his desk.
Can I see Jordan's phone logs
for the last couple of weeks?
What for?
He's been receiving
some threatening mail.
Uh, I want to cross check it
with all his incoming calls.
It doesn't leave this office.
Sorry, Mr. Tyler. She can't be disrbed.
Mr. Tyler, please.
This won't take long.
Dr. Kern...
I told him you were busy.
Lily isn't scheduled for another
appointment today, is she?
No, she isn't.
I want to know why you call Jordan Collier
every time s comes see you.
My phone habits don't really
concern you, Mr. Tyler.
That's just it - I think they do.
And you're gonna tell me
what Jordan Collier knows
about Lily's baby that she doesn't.
Sickle-cell anemia?
How can my baby have the trait
for sickle-cell anemia?
Unless t father is black.
Maybe he is.
What are you saying, Richard?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe whoever took us used me
as some kind of... donor.
The question is,
why would Jordan have Dr. Kern
keep this from us?
This baby's carrying
the sickle-cell trai..
that brings you and I closer together
Maybe he doesn't want that to happen.
Maybe.
I think it's time me
and him have a talk.
Michelle Hickock,
returnee number 938 -
she's coming in
this afternoon at 4:00
for a counseling session,
and I want to see her
afterwards, okay?
He's logged on.
Lytell's on the network.
You're good to go.
Tom really appreciates
your helping him.
I'm not doing it for Tom.
Come on...
Hey.
So Kyle's being held
at the Quarantine Center,
building nine, subbasement three.
That's great. I owe you.
Okay, well...
Marco.
Thanks for your help.
No worries.
All right, you ready to roll?
I think we should wait
till after 5:00
when the night shift comes on.
That way, at least they're half staffed.
Okay, I'll pick
you up at 4:00. See you.
Here. This is the place.
It's just outside of the city
in West Bellevue.
How do you know the guy selling
it isn't gonna be there?
He's in Spain for three months.
Another realtor told me.
It'll make a perfect safe house.
Okay, get it set up.
And make sure you're not
followed on the way there.
You think I'm being watched?
Well, if I was Lytell,
I'd keep an eye on you.
Just remember to check your
rearview mirror and stay cool.
I remember what you taught me.
I just never thought
I'd have to use it.
You'll do fine.
I'll get Kyle,
and I'll meet you out there.
I'll be waiting.
And be careful.
I will.
Nice, huh?
I remember how much you told me
you like moonstones.
I do.
But I-I can't accept these.
Why not?
I mean, I got them for you.
Come on, Nikki.
Look, I know I messed up.
Didn't Shawn talk to you?
Shawn. What does he have to do
with anything?
Come on. Nikki?
* It's been a while *
* Since I could call you... *
Hey, Dawn. Hey.
Maia ready?
Maia's over by the playground
talking with one of your colleagues.
Some of the clothes look funny,
and the cars.
But I don'know,
video games are kind of fun.
Did you like the video games in
the rec room at Quarantine?
There are so many people,
I hardly ever got a chance to play.
Lytell!
What are you doing here?
Just talking with Maia.
I'd heard so much about her,
I thought it was time we met.
Stay away from her.
That's not really your call,
now, is it?
Maia, it was nice talking with you.
We'll do it again soon.
I don't like him.
And he doesn't really like me, either.
Well, don't you worry about him.
Are you sure?
Oh... you listen to me, Maia.
I am absolutely sure.
I am not gonna let anything bad
happen to you, you hear me?
All right?
Okay.
Jordan, you have a minute?
I know why you're here.
Roxanne Kern called me
as soon as you left her office.
Look, Richard,
I hope you and Lily
aren't blowing this up
into something bigger than it is
just 'cause some doctor's
trying to land
on the good side of my checkbook.
Lily and I appreciate everything
you've done for us,
from the house to my job.
Our lives have been a lot more
comfortable since we met.
You're gonna hurt me now, aren't you?
But we think it's time you back off
and let us run our own lives.
Whatever you want.
Tell Lily I said hi, will you?
I'll do that.
You good to go?
Just give me a sec.
Gloria, just remember what I told you.
Don't answer the door
to anyone you don't know, okay?
Cool.
You leaving now?
Yeah, but don't worry, sweetheart,
'cause I'll be back before
you wake up, all right?
Okay.
All right.
There you go. Bye.
Diana.
Don't worry.
You'll find him.
Find who?
Your son, Kyle.
He's the answer.
The answer to what?
Everything.
I want to see, uh,
Kyle Baldwin, please.
You're not on the authorization list.
Oh, no, no, I'm just
a friend of the family,
and I want to know that he's all right.
'Cause he's not even one of the 4400,
and his father works with me at Intec,
and I don't know,
if you could just give me something
that I could tell him.
'Cause...
come on, we're both supposed to be
on the same side, right?
I'll see what I can find out.
Oh, great. Thank you so much.
That's great.
It's all right, you won't even have
a headache when you wa up, okay?
Oh, well, maybe a little headache.
Come on in.
Kyle, buddy.
It's me, buddy, okay, huh?
Huh?
Highland Beach.
Yeah, what about it?
That's where I have to go.
Highland Beach?
Let's get you out
of here first, okay?
Come on, up.
Okay?
We got him, Linda.
Yeah. No, he's sitting
right here next to me.
He's about the same.
No worse, anyway.
I'll see you in a little while.
How far away is the safe house?
It's about 30 miles.
Your mom's waiting for you, buddy.
No.
Highland Beach.
Hey!
Kyle! No, let go.
Kyle, Kyle, stop!
Highland Beach!
Kyle, let go, Kyle!
Back off! Calm down!
We have to go there.
We have to go there now.
What's at Highland Beach?
That's where Shawn disappeared.
I have to go back there.
Just, just
calm down, buddy.
Just...
If that's what you want,
we'll-we'll take you.
You sure about that?
Kyle's the answer, right?
Two of your agents are operating
outside of the tent.
I noticed.
Do you know why?
Because you pulled the Baldwin kid
out of the hospital.
Yeah, well, D.C.
wouldn't see it that way.
D.C. thought it was a good move
to send you here.
Well, you gonna bring him in or not?
Find him.
So, these are the
names of the people
who are coming to the next
support group meeting.
It's a little bigger
than the last one,
so we may need a couple more tables.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
Lily?
Can I e you for a minute?
Um, I-I have a few errands to run.
is won't take long.
Where'd you get this?
I've been doing security
checks on everyone
who's moved into the complex.
Well,
don't look shocked, Lily.
I mean, consider my position.
A lot of people, including half
my own board of directors
would love to see me
fall on my face here.
A scandal like this would give
them the last bit of leverage
they need to force me
out of the company
and put themselves back in power.
Richard would ver do anything
like this.
I'd have thought so, too.
I guess we were both wrong.
Do you really think
this is gonna change the way
I feel about him?
That's up to you.
But, Lily,
you really have to a yourself...
is this the man you
want raising your baby?
Aren't you gonna say something?
It was my 23rd birthday.
A bunch of guys from the barracks
invited me out
to a bar.
You don't drink.
Didn't then, either.
But these guys -
it was a big deal
they asking me to come along.
In those days,
Negroes and whites didn't do
much socializing.
So, I went.
It was kind of nice, you know.
Then this...
woman started coming on to me.
People started staring.
So...
I figured it was time
for me to get out of there.
She followed me outside
and asked me to go home with her.
I declined respectfuy.
That's when she started screaming.
That's it?
That's all that happened?
That's all it took in 1945.
Because the statement
the woman made to the police-
I mean, it's so detailed.
Lily, none
of it's true.
If I hadn't been completely
exonerated of those charges,
do-do-do you think
the Air Force would-would
have sent me
to flight school?
Made me an officer or a pilot?
The woman lied.
The charges got dropped.
Why would Jordan bring
any of this up?
He wants you to start doubting me...
doubting us.
Do you?
We got to pack
whatever we can in five minutes.
We're gettg out of here.
They're heading west
on Sandberg.
There are no freeways in that direction.
Highland Beach.
I bet that's where they're going.
Have my car brought around.
I'm coming.
I don't care what the hell you do.
Just keep your mouth shut
and stay out of my way.
Come on, Mom are you serious?
The movies-- like, you and me?
Is that so weird?
I mean, we used to g
to the movies all the time.
Well, when I was six.
Shawn!
You prick.
Get... Oh!
Danny.
Danny...
listen to me.
You goddamned freak...!
Danny, stop this!
Boys, please!
Danny
Shawn, stop! Please!
Goddamn it,
stop blaming me for Nikki!
Don't you see it's over
between you two?!
That's enough!
Danny?!
Shawn, stop it! You're killing him!
What did you do?
I don't know.
I didn't mean to do anything.
Danny?
Get away from him!
Shawn?
What happened?
I heard you guys shouting.
Don't touch me.
What?
Don't touch me.
Ah. You're the only good thing
that's happened to me
since I've been back.
But I can't stay here,
and you can't come where I'm going.
Shawn.
I love you, Nikki.
I love you.
What are you doing?
Shawn?
What... No.
Stay here and talk about this.
Shawn?
Shawn, what are you doing?!
Shawn!
What's all this?
What's it look like?
Have you two thought
about what you're doing?
I mean, really thought about it?
Because let me remind you,
it is dangerous outside those gates.
We'll risk it.
Lily, think about the baby.
What does the baby have to do with this?
Everything.
That baby could be the key
to the future, and it has
to be protected, and I can do that,
better than Richard, better than anyone.
Lily, get in the car.
I'm afraid I can't
let you do that. Stay away from her.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, God...
Go ahead, run!
It won do you any good.
I will find you.
That baby belongs with me.
Kyle.
Damn it, Kyle, we've been
walking for ten minutes.
What are you looking for?
Maybe we can help you, Kyle.
This was where we found him.
We're running out of time.
Kyle, I brought you here like you asked.
But if there's something you need to do,
you better do it fast.
I belong here.
I tried really hard.
And no matter what I've done,
which way I've turned, it just...
It sucks.
I need to clear my head
and get away for a while.
I guess what I'm asking is
if I could stay here for a while.
Shawn, you're one of the 4400.
As far as I'm concerned,
you can stay here as long as you want.
That's great, man, thanks.
Thank you.
So, um, tell me a little more
about this ability of yours.
Any idea where we're headed?
I'll know it when I see it.
He's gonna come after us.
Baby likes that.
You know, it really
wouldn't be so bad, would it?
If you were the father?
No, it wouldn't be bad at all.
That's their car. Let's go.
Now listen, these are not criminals here.
These are two of our own.
I want you to keep your gun holstered.
There's no cause for anybody to get hurt.
Kyle, they're coming for you.
They're gonna want to take you away.
They're too late.
Kyle. Kyle!
Don't!
Kyle.
Tom.
You're not my son, are you?
No.
Kyle was meant to be a channel...
a way to communicate.
Communicate with who?
With you.
To guide you in your dealings
with the returnees.
But something went wrong.
Shawn interrupted the process.
That's what put him in a coma.
He was like that
for three years because of you.
Tom.
Tom.
Tom.
Who are you? What are you?
I'm human.
Like you.
No, you're nothing like me.
I come from a different time.
That is all.
Your future.
Is that where you took them?
My nephew and, and all the others?
We needed them.
For what?
To survive.
Skouris.
Skouris.
In my time, humanity is dying out.
You mean, it's all going to end?
Everything?
What in the ll is going on?
I don't know.
Kyle brought us out here.
It's like he knew it was gonna happen.
Did you ever think
that maybe he's not Kyle Baldwin?
He kept claiming he wasn't.
Maybe he's telling the truth.
Hey, Tom.
Tom, are you all right?
We can't just stand around.
We got to do something.
He could take Baldwin with him
or kill him.
Hey, nobody is going to do anything
until we know what's going on in there.
Only those we took can prevent
the catastrophe from happening.
That's why they've
been altered and seeded
back into the timeline.
But why here? Why now?
'Cause history tells us this is where
the path to oblivion began.
And-and the people you took?
They're going to stop that from
happening - how?
They've already begun their work...
and you've begun yours.
Tom, come on.
Do something, Ryland, or I will.
That's it.
I need you out of there.
I don't understand.
What... what is their work?
What are we supposed to do?
You have to help them.
Help them? How?
How?
You're bleeding.
Oh, God. G-Get an ambulance. Now!
Kyle... Kyle, no, Kyle,
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!
Stay-stay with me, stay with me, Kyle.
Stay with me. Just stay with me.
Look at me, look at me, look at me, Kyle.
Stay here, stay here.
No, no, no...
Kyle... Kyle...
Kyle, look at me, look at me.
Stay with me Kyle, stay with me.
Stay with me, come on.
Stay with me.
No.
Come on, come on.
No.
No...
No... no, no!
Tom.
Dad?
Kyle?
What are you doing here?
Where's - where's Shawn?
Kyle?
Oh, I-I can explain about the beer.
No.
I-I...
Oh, forget the beer.
You don't have to explain anything.
What's going on?
Tom.
Tom, what did you see?
I got you.
The baby.
It's time?
Mm.
I'll get the car.
Précédemment dans 4400…
Une comčte ne change pas de trajectoire.
- Celle ci l'a fait.
- Alors ce n'est pas une comčte.
Nous ne sommes pas sűrs de ce qui arrive.
On distingue quelque chose.
La lumičre a disparue,
laissant place ŕ des milliers de personne.
Diana Skouris. Tom baldwin.
Vous deux serez une des équipes
qui enquętera sur les revenants.
On les laisse partir.
On les laisse partir ?
On n’a aucun droit de les retenir.
Pourquoi faire disparaître une petite fille dans les années 40,
la retenir durant 60 ans
et la renvoyer avec la capacité
de prédire l'avenir.
- Je peux rentrer ŕ la maison ?
- La maison ?
Avec vous,
je n'aime pas ętre seule ici.
Shawn Farrell...
- Oncle Tommy.
- Salut.
Il est tout a vous.
Et Kyle ?
Kyle est dans le coma, Shawn.
Que diable as tu fais ŕ Kyle ?
Je ne sais pas ce qui s’est passé.
J'ai posé mes mains sur lui. C’est tout.
Il s'est réveillé.
Tu parles d'une sorte d’effet domino ?
Diana Skouris toujours
premičre de la classe.
Les incidents ne sont que des catalyseurs
du changement.
Je le jure devant Dieu.
je ne te le demanderai qu'une fois…
Oů est mon fils ?
- Kyle ! Kyle
- Non !
Tom, Non !
Vous n'ętes pas mon fils.
Qui ętes vous ? Qu’est ce que vous ętes.?
Je suis un humain.
Je viens d'une autre époque, votre futur.
A mon époque, l'humanité est mourante.
Seuls les revenants
peuvent empęcher la catastrophe.
C'est pourquoi ils ont été modifiés
et rendus au cours du temps.
Vous voulez dire que ce sera la fin du monde ?
- Vous devez les aider.
- Les aider ? Comment ?
Papa ?
Kyle...
Je veux fournir un endroit sűr,
pour chacun des 4400 qui le souhaite.
Sale taré.
Danny, arręte ça.
Arręte de m’accuser pour Nikki !
Je suppose que ce que je demande c'est
si je peux rester ici quelques temps.
Parle moi un peu plus
de ton pouvoir...
Je n'étais pas enceinte avant l'enlčvement,
mais je l'étais ŕ mon retour.
Ce bébé peut-ętre la clef pour le futur
et doit ętre protégé, et je peux le faire.
Fuyez !
Je vous retrouverai.
Ce bébé m'appartient.

Isabelle...
Quoi, mon trésor ?
Un cauchemar ?
Toujours le męme.
Elle va bien, Richard.
On va tous bien.
Reviens te coucher.
C'est certainement un raton laveur...
C'était qui ?
Ils sont partis
avant que j’ai pu demander.
Ils ont laissés quelque chose.
Quelqu'un nous a trouvé.
Qui ?
NTAC, Collier ?
Ça ressemble
ŕ leur carte de visite pour toi ?
Je ne sais pas qui, mais quelqu'un
sait que nous sommes des 4400.
Commence ŕ faire les valises.
Je vais en ville demain,
prendre ma paye et on file d'ici.
Pourquoi pas maintenant ?
On aura besoin de cet argent, Lily.
Mr et Mme Sumlin.
Peter.
Si vous voulez me suivre.
Pardon pour le décor,
le centre n'ouvre
officiellement que demain.
Peter n'a plus le temps d'attendre.
C'est lŕ oů vous avez tort, Mme Sumlin.
Peter a tout le temps du monde.
Salut, Peter.
Mon nom est Jordan Collier.
Par ici.
Notre centre hospitalier n'est pas pręt.
Nous avons pensé
que Peter serait plus ŕ l'aise ici.
Bonjour, Peter.
Je suis Shawn.
Et  si on commençait ?
Ouais.
Ok, petit.
Prends mes mains.
Détends toi.
D’accord ?
C’est bon.
Tu le fais bien. Trčs bien.
C’est bon.
Oh, mon dieu,
il va bien ?
Il va trčs bien.
Observez.
C'est bon.
Tu vas bien. Tu vas bien.
Peter ?
Comment te sens-tu, mon chéri ?
Fiston ?
Merci
pour votre généreuse donation.
On a tout essayé.
Radiothérapie, greffe de moelle osseuse…
Est il vraiment guéri ?
Retournez voir son médecin,
faites lui passer des examens.
La leucémie de Peter est partie.
C'est un miracle.
Pour l'instant,
cela doit rester secret.
L'accord de confidentialité
que vous avez signé le stipule.
Mais les gens devraient savoir
ŕ propos de ce jeune homme.
Et ils le sauront.
Le moment venu.
Ils sauront tout.
Trčs joli.
- Tu es nerveuse ?
- Pas toi ?
Non, pas du tout.
Bon, peut-ętre un peu.
D'accord, extręmement.
Mais tu veux vraiment faire ça, n’est-ce pas ?
Oui.
A llons-y.
Il est dit ici qu’elle a montré une capacité
de type Dinstman-Lenhoff.
Elle a des sortes de visions prémonitoires ?
Oui, ses visions se sont arrętés
il y a 4 mois, sans raison apparente.
D ommage,
j'allais demander si Teledex allait
exploser des prévisions trimestrielles.
On aimerait commencer
si c'est possible.
Bien sűr.
Si vous voulez signer aux endroits indiqués.
Diana Skouris, votre adoption de
Maia Rutledge est par ceci effective,
officielle, et définitive.
Attesté par moi-męme, Henry Biederman,
et par le 10čme tribunal des affaires

Certains de nous doivent regarder
bien loin, pour trouver leur "famille".
Vous deux avez regardé
au delŕ du temps.
Diana laissez moi vous présentez
votre fille, Maia.
Maia, dis bonjour ŕ Maman.
<i>Commandemant de l'Evaluation de la Menace Nationale - Seattle, Etat de Washington.</i>
Je ne le ferai pas.
Et je le pense cette fois. Y a pas moyen.
C'est juste un scanner, Kyle.
T'en as déjŕ eu.
Celui lŕ va leur dire la męme chose
que les 150 précédents… C'est-ŕ-dire rien.
Il n'y a personne
d'autre que moi, lŕ.
Je le sais,
et tôt ou tard,
ils vont arręter de chercher.
Quand ? Quand ça ?
J'aimerais le savoir.
Mais avec le NTAC, le gouvernement,
il y a bien plus en jeux que toi ou moi, tu comprends ?
Kyle, ils veulent juste comprendre
ce qui s'est passé ŕ Highland Beach. C’est tout.
Ils ont peur que s’ils me laissent sortir,
je révčle leur grand secret.
Ils peuvent se détendre,
je veux juste sortir d'ici
et redevenir normal.
Et les gens normaux ne radotent pas
sur le futur de l'humanité
ou sur la fin du monde.
En plus, je ne me souviens męme pas
ce qu'il s'est passé.
Je sais.
Vous m'entendez ?
Je ne me souviens pas !
Calme toi.
Papa, sors moi de lŕ.
Parle ŕ quelqu'un,
n'importe qui. S’il te plaît, parce que…
D'accord.
C'est bon.
Ok.
Tom,
ça fait un bail, hein ?
Tu sais comment c'est.
Les bureaucrates n'ont pas beaucoup
de raison de te mettre avec un agent rebelle.
Quelqu'un s'apitoie
sur son sort aujourd'hui ?
« Le chemin de l'oubli commence ici. »
Les 4400 ont été envoyé pour sauver
l'humanité, et je suis supposé les aider...
J'étais lŕ sur la plage, tu te souviens ?
Ils m'ont donné une mission,
Quel est ma plus belle action
de la semaine ?
J'ai convaincu
mon fils de repasser un scanner.
Et je ne suis pas sűr
que c'était ce qu'ils avaient en tęte...
Diana, vous ętes pręte ?
Dans une minute.
On doit contrôler 3 revenants de plus,
et je veux m'assurer
qu'on rendra le rapport avant 17h.
Pourquoi ne vas-tu pas fais chauffer la voiture ?
J'arrive.
Bien sur.
Vic Hubbard est le meilleur enquęteur
que t’aies pu trouver ?
Oh, non, c'est le 4čme cette année.
2 de plus et je bats un record.
On doit te sortir de derričre ce bureau.
Je suis déjŕ chanceux d'avoir un boulot ici.
J'ai braqué un autre agent,
tu te souviens ?
Ouais , bon,
j'ai pas dit que ça allait ętre facile.
C'est vraiment ce qui s'est passé.
Tu vas recommencer
avec les énergies négatives ?
Les trous blancs, ils sont la clef.
C'est comme ça qu’ils les ont enlevés,
et renvoyés
Mais les trous blancs... La 2čme loi de...
- Oui, parce que j’ai raison.
Voyons.
- Les gars !
- C’est comment d’avoir tort ?
J'interromps quelque chose ?
Brady en remet une couche
avec ses trous blancs, encore.
Un jour tu m'expliqueras la différence
entre les blancs et noirs.
Bien, pourquoi pas ce soir ?
Pourquoi est-ce que tu ne me donnerais
pas simplement ce dont on a parlé ?
- Je peux pas.
- Pourquoi ?
Je l'ai déjŕ envoyé lŕ haut.
Je me demande si quelqu'un le lit...

Tu es si gentil.

J'aurais aimé t'emmener avec moi,

Je joue au jeu de la salle des Théories

- Laissez moi vous donner un indice.
"La nécessité de l'immédiate réassignation
de Thomas Baldwin ŕ son poste sur le terrain."
Un titre accrocheur.
Vous avez trouvé ça toute seule,
ou ce sont les cerveaux du sous sol ?
Disons que je suis d'accord avec l'idée.
Tom est le meilleur agent avec lequel
j'ai bossé, peut ętre le meilleur de la division.
Pendant les 3 mois ou Baldwin a enquęté
sur les 4400,
ce département en a appris plus
que durant toute cette année
oů il a trié de la paperasse.
Il a menacé la vie d'un autre agent.
Il essayait de protéger son fils,
que ces hommes du futur, ou quoi qu'ils soient,
ont pris pour porte-parole.
Sans mentionner
que son neveu Shawn est un 4400.
C'est un énorme
conflit d'intéręt pour moi.
Ce n'est pas
ce que Dennis Ryland pensait.
Dennis Ryland n'est plus en poste ici.
Vous devriez appeler Washington et
lui parler.
Je n'ai pas ŕ appeler Washington.
On est en ligne directe.
Députés, sénateurs,
commissions, sous-commissions
tous observent ce département, et ils m'observent,
pour avoir des réponses.
Voilŕ pourquoi vous ne pouvez pas
garder Tom Baldwin hors jeu.
C'est un atout majeur, dans cette affaire.
Peut ętre l'atout majeur.
C'est drôle,
c'est exactement ce qui est dit dans ce mémo.
Peut ętre que Marco m'a demandé
de vérifier la typo.
La prochaine fois que vous voulez
me faire passer un message,
mettez votre nom.
Mr Walcott !
Descendez de lŕ.

Mr Walcott, descendez de lŕ !

Je l'ai !
Oh, oh... oh, mon dieu.
Oh, mon dieu !
Non !
Lily, je suis rentré.
Lily, détends-toi, on n'est plus obligés de partir.
Un dingue a placardé ça dans toute la ville.
Il ne nous a pas repairé.
Je crois quand męme
qu'on devrait partir.
J'avais peur hier aussi.
Mais tu as lu ça ?
C'est un délire
pas une chasse aux sorcičres.
Peut-ętre, mais Richard,
On ne se sent plus en sécurité ici.
Tu veux dire qu'Isabelle ne
se sens plus protégée.
Richard, on en a déjŕ parlé une douzaine de fois.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
elle me parle qu’ŕ moi et pas ŕ toi...
Parle ?
Communique. Qu'importe.
Est-ce qu’elle a dit oů on devrait aller ?
Elle a déjŕ choisi un lieu,
ou elle saura en le voyant ?
On peut trouver une ville.
On l'a déjŕ trouvée, ici.
Isabelle a 6 mois.
Je sais qu'elle est spéciale,
mais nous sommes ses parents.
Nous prenons les décisions
pour elle, pas le contraire.
Je sais. Il est temps de partir d'ici.
Tu as raison.
Tu as tout ŕ fait raison.
On reste ici.
Signez ça.
Qu'est ce que c'est ?
Votre lettre de démission.
Je pensais ętre ŕ nouveau sur le terrain.
Vous l'ętes.
C'est effectif immédiatement.
Je veux des résultats.
Nous avons une collection précieuse de diplômés au sous-sol
qui me disent que vous ętes le meilleur moyen d’en obtenir.
Je suis donc disposée ŕ prendre ce risque.
Mais j'ai besoin de garanties.
Ceci.
Je  n'ai pas mis de date.
Si vous dépassez les limites, je remplis la case.
C'est juste.
Bien.
Lŕ. Regardez ça.
Tess Doerner.
Diagnostic de schizophrénie paranoďaque ŕ l'âge de 15 ans.
Disparue de l'hôpital psychiatrique d'Abendson en avril 1955.
Laissez-moi deviner, ils l'ont renvoyée sans se soucier de la guérir ?
Guérir les gens ne faisait sűrement pas partie de leur plan.
On vient de recevoir un appel ŕ propos de l'hôpital.
Un de leurs infirmiers est mort.
Il prétend qu'il y a un rapport.
On va vérifier ça.
Attends.
Il y a encore un élément du deal qu'on doit régler.
Vous imposez des conditions ?
C'est ta nouvelle maison ?
C'est aussi la tienne.
Toutes tes affaires sont ici. Je...
On dirait ton ancienne chambre, tu ne trouves pas ?
J'ai essayé au moins.
Il y a juste une chose qui manque...
Maman.
Je sais. Parfois je n'arrive pas non plus ŕ croire qu'elle ne soit plus lŕ.
Mais on a essayé, Kyle, tu sais,
on a vraiment voulu que ça marche.
J'aurais aimé que vous essayiez un peu plus sérieusement.
Désolé, c'est juste que...
Tu sais, quand quelque chose d'horrible se passe au sein d'une famille,
comme quand tu étais ŕ l'hôpital, ça peut...
rapprocher les gens, ou bien...
les éloigner. Ta mčre et moi...
Je vais devoir l'appeler, pour qu'elle sache que je suis sorti de quarantaine.
Oui, bonne idée. Tu sais, elle sera vraiment contente...
Shawn va halluciner, lui aussi.
Quoi ? Tu savais que je voudrais le voir, non ?
Tu es un bon cousin.
Ne te fais pas trop d'illusions. Les gens changent en 4 ans, tu sais.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ croire que tu sois ici. Je...
J'ai attendu ce moment trop longtemps.
Hé...
Tu te souviens combien on aimait aller dans les cages pour frapper des balles ?
Tu n'arrivais jamais ŕ renvoyer les balles courbes.
Moi ? Non, c'était toi,
J'ai gardé plein de monnaie, alors si tu veux...
On pourrait aussi s'arręter au practice ?
Tu veux apprendre ŕ jouer au golf ?
J'ai toujours voulu t'apprendre !
Il y a beaucoup de choses que je veux essayer ŕ présent, papa.
Fais une liste. Quoique tu veuilles, on le fera.
Tout ce que tu veux.
Tu me la montreras ce soir, d'accord ?
Tu t'en vas déjŕ ? Je viens juste d'arriver !
C'est mon boulot, mon pote.
Tu peux commencer ta liste maintenant.
On prend vraiment les travaux manuels au sérieux ici, hein ?
Vous ętes sűr que Tess a dessiné ça avant qu'ils ne commencent ŕ construire ça ?
Elle a fait son premier croquis il y a 2 semaines.
Ils ont commencé ŕ monter ce truc hier.
Et vous pensez que l'infirmier qui est mort a un rapport avec tout ça ?
Arlo était sur la corniche du bâtiment B, en train de forcer pour détacher une girouette.
Je pense que c'était cette girouette.
Mais pourquoi ne confinez vous pas tous les autres patients dans leur chambre ?
Ca m'a traversé l'esprit, mais ce genre de comportement coopératif est sans précédent avec de telles maladies.
En plus, je voulais que voyiez ce truc avant qu'on ne le détruise ŕ nouveau.
Tout va bien, Kevin.
Ils sont lŕ pour parler avec Tess, c'est tout.
Il est trčs protecteur avec elle.
C'est sa seule amie ici.
Tout va bien, vraiment.
Je vais la prévenir de votre arrivée.
Bien.
Nous avons vu certains de vos dessins, Tess. Ils sont vraiment bons.
Ils vont vous entendre.
Il y a des micros dans les murs.
Ils émettent par satellite, vers les sous-marins.
Qui ça ?
Les médecins.
Les médecins de cet hôpital ?
Certains sont dans cet hôpital.
D'autres se trouvent dans le sous-marin.
D'accord, on va parler moins fort.
Ils ont pris mes crayons, mais c'était trop tard.
Ah oui ? Pourquoi ça ?
Parce que ce sera construit de toutes façons.
Ils veulent qu'on soit en contact,
c'est pour ça qu'ils ont mis les plans dans ma tęte.
On parle des médecins de l'hôpital, lŕ, ou bien de ceux
qui sont sous la mer ?
Ni l'un ni l'autre.
On parle des gens qui m'ont enlevée...
...idiot.
Donc, les gens qui vous ont enlevée...
ils veulent que les malades d'ici construisent cette tour ?
Ils feraient n'importe quoi pour me renvoyer.
Ils m'aiment bien.
C'est vous qui avez demandé de l'aide aux autres malades, Tess ?
Je n'aime pas leur parler.
Ils sont cinglés.
Est-ce qu'Arlo était cinglé ?
Je n'ai jamais pensé qu'il l'était...
mais peut-ętre que la folie est contagieuse.
Il me dictait une lettre.
Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé. Il a attrapé sa tęte et a commencé ŕ crier.
Attendez dehors. Tout de suite.
Calmez-vous. Calmez-vous.
Merci.
Elles empirent.
Jordan...
Elles reviennent plus souvent aussi.
- Ca va ?
- Je vais bien.
Je ne comprends pas. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi ces attaques
continuent de survenir.
J'ai guéri...
l'emphysčme, la leucémie...
des fractures...
Ce bébé vous a vraiment mis au tapis.
Eh bien, souviens-toi de ça quand on retrouvera Richard et Lily.
On dirait que vous ętes trčs confiant lŕ dessus, mais ça fait 1 an, Jordan.
J'oublie parfois qu'ils ne sont pas ici.
Moi, je n'oublie jamais,
et les hommes que j'ai payés pour les trouver non plus.
Ok, mais si j'étais vous,
je n'aimerais pas me trouver dans le męme fuseau horaire que ce gamin.
Si vous vous rencontrez ŕ nouveau,
ça pourrait vous achever.
J'ai mes raisons.
<i>En titre de ce journal,</i>
<i>des révélations ŕ propos des origines des 4400.</i>
<i>Dans son autobiographie sortie aujourd'hui,</i>
<i>l'ancien magnat de l'immobilier, Jordan Collier, affirme</i>
<i>que les 4400 ont été enlevés</i>
<i>par des humains venant du futur.</i>
<i>Le livre contient des copies de documents gouvernementaux, dont Collier prétend</i>
<i>qu'elles prouvent ses dires.</i>
<i>Les documents viendraient d'une source anonyme au sein du commandement national de l'évaluation de la menace.</i>
<i>Selon Collier,</i>
<i>les 4400 ont été renvoyés pour empęcher la catastrophe qui menacerait la survie de l'humanité.</i>
Pourquoi tu ne m'en as pas parlé ?
<i>Collier ajoute</i>
<i>que le gouvernement avait cette information depuis plus d'un an,
mais l'a gardée secrčte afin d'éviter une panique générale.</i>
<i>Le gouvernement déclare que ces documents sont
purement spéculatifs et ont été cités hors contexte.</i>
Rien ŕ foutre de qui les a enlevés.
Rien ŕ foutre de qui les a renvoyés. Le gouvernement aurait du les garder derričre des barreaux.
T'as pas entendu ce que ce mec dit ? Ils sont lŕ pour sauver le monde.
Qu'est ce que tu voulais qu'il dise d'autre ? C'est l'un d'entre eux.
T'es bien silencieux.
Je ne crois que ce que je vois...
Et ce que je vois c'est que...
je dois vider ce radiateur avant le déjeuner.
Vous serez heureux d'apprendre que la source anonyme de M. Collier ne l'est plus.
L'agent Hubbard sera poursuivi dans toute l'étendue de la loi.
Qu'est ce qu'on fait avec Collier ?
Ce type a acheté des secrets d'état au marché noir.
Je suis sure que tout le monde ici voudrait voir Collier accusé de trahison, mais c'est peu probable.
Et je doute qu'on arrive ŕ remonter les paiements jusqu'ŕ lui.
Maintenant,
pour ce qui est de ce qu'ils appellent "le Centre 4400",
il est sous surveillance 24h/24 jusqu'ŕ nouvel ordre.
Je veux des photos de quiconque s'approche ŕ moins de 100 mčtres de cet endroit.
Est-il exact que Collier est en train d'essayer d'obtenir un statut qui l'exončre d'impôts ?
Apparemment.
Il transforme les 4400 en une sorte de religion ?
Plutôt en un culte.
Oui enfin, c'est comme ça que les grosses congrégations
appellent une petite congrégation.
Culte, religion, peu importe. Sur quoi est-ce qu'il le base ?
Vous avez lu ce truc ?
Collier prétend qu'il peut révéler un 4400 ŕ l'intérieur de n'importe qui.
Donc il espčre qu'un gars qui pointe ŕ Pittsburgh
va croire qu'il a un genre de superpouvoir latent ?
La plupart des 4400 n'ont męme pas ce genre de capacités.
Pas encore, ŕ vrai dire.
Non, mais si vous pensiez qu'il y a une chance
que vous ayez un pouvoir caché en vous...
On dirait que vous ętes pręte ŕ vous inscrire.
Non,
mais je ne blâmerais personne d'ętre curieux.
Il faut continuer ŕ dire aux gens que, biologiquement,
les 4400 ne sont pas différents de nous autres.
Ils n'ont pas été altérés génétiquement, ni neurologiquement...
Autant qu'on puisse le dire.
Mais si Collier croit que les gens vont gager leur vie
et leurs économies pour une sorte de...
systčme pyramidal métaphysique, alors...
le réveil va ętre brutal.
Bienvenue au Centre. Je m'appelle Devon.
- Comment vous appelez-vous ?
- Kyle
Enchantée, Kyle. Je vous inscris pour une visite ?
Merci. Je cherche juste mon cousin, Shawn Farrell ?
Je suis désolée, M. Farrell n'est pas disponible pour l'instant.
Vous pourriez lui dire que Kyle le cherche ? Il vit ici, n'est ce pas ?
J'ai bien peur que nos rčgles nous interdisent de parler de nos membres.
Je ne cherche pas ŕ discuter. Je veux juste saluer mon cousin.
Si vous voulez bien me laisser vos nom et numéro...
Je ne vous laisse rien du tout ! Quel est le problčme ?
Il n'y a aucun problčme.
Alors dites ŕ Shawn que je suis lŕ ! S'il ne veut pas me voir, trčs bien, mais c'est lui que ça regarde, ok ?
Pourriez-vous baisser d'un ton, s'il vous plaît ?
Ecoutez, je n'ai rien contre vous. Personnellement,
j'espčre que vous, le robot, vous retrouverez votre corps un jour.
Si c'est ça, je trouverai Shawn moi-męme.
Par ici, monsieur.
- Lâchez-moi !
- Vous devez partir.
Vous ne m'aviez pas dit que ce truc était si gros.
- Il ne l'était pas.
- Pas hier.
Et eux, on ne dirait pas que ce sont des patients.
Ils ne le sont pas.
Dr. Clayton !
Je sais ce que vous allez dire. On a pris du retard.
On rattrapera le temps perdu cet aprčs-midi.
Bon, est-ce que tout l'hôpital travaille sur cet engin ?
C'est le seul moyen d'y arriver.
Excusez-moi.
Randy, Winston, on a besoin d'aide par ici.
Dr. Cho est de retour avec la parabole.
Ok.
Les patients d'abord, et maintenant le personnel.
S'il s'agit d'hystérie collective, c'est en train de s'étendre.
C'est scandaleux ! On a un travail ŕ finir, ici. Un travail important.
Les médecins veulent travailler. Dites leur de faire leurs
visites. Personne ne les empęche de s'occuper de leurs patients.
A partir de maintenant,
- la tour et la cour intérieure sont interdites, compris ?
- Compris.
Mec, regarde la taille de ce truc.
Ca me déplairait pas d'en avoir un comme ça dans mon jardin.
Ta virée est finie. Va attendre dans la voiture.
Donc hier, quelques patients ne pouvaient pas s'empęcher de travailler sur cette chose,
et aujourd'hui, c'est l'hôpital entier.
Si on sort Tess d'ici,
est-ce que tu penses que cette aliénation va s'atténuer ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ca vaut le coup d'essayer, non ?
Ok, je te tiens.
Tout va bien.
Je ne suis pas une personne mauvaise.
Vraiment pas.
Personne n'a dit ça, Tess.
Alors pourquoi est-ce que vous allez m'enfoncer des fils dans le cerveau ?
Je te promets, Tess, que personne ne vas te faire de mal.
C'est ce que tout le monde dit, juste avant de vous faire mal.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'on me puni ? Je suis gentille. Vraiment. Je leur obéis, c'est tout.
Les gars ! Les gars ! Ramenez-vous !
Kevin !
Ok, Tess. Allons-y. Allez.
- Tout va bien.
- Kevin...
Je viens de recevoir les résultats de Tess
Laisse moi deviner...
En bonne santé sur toute la ligne ?
Tu peux dire ça pour tous les 4400...
ils sont tous identiques.
Tess a dessiné le croquis...
d'une tour, d'un monument...
Oui, ou d'une balise...
Et les gens autour d'elle ont tout laissé tomber
et ont commencé ŕ la construire
Ils n'ont plus de libre arbitre.
Ils doivent travailler
C'est comme chez les fourmis.
Venez ici.
La reine sécrčte une substance chimique,
qui dicte aux autres fourmis ce qu'elles doivent faire
Les ouvriers ne s'arręteront pas de travailler
tant que la tâche n'est pas terminée.
ils ne se soucient pas si l'un d'eux meurt,
ou si
une tempęte arrive et balaie la fourmiličre
Ils continuent simplement ŕ travailler...
A moins que vous n'enleviez la reine.
Espérons que nos ouvriers fonctionnent ainsi.
Donc le futur nous a renvoyé
une reine fourmi schizophrčne,
avec un plan pour quoi ?
Une sorte de talkie-walkie interstellaire.
Voyons ce que Tess peut nous dire.
Nous ne devrions pas trop nous en approcher,
car si ta théorie est juste,
n'importe qui exposé ŕ elle serait vulnérable.
Bien, j'irai parler ŕ Tess. Vous, vous vérifiez
avec Garrity ŕ l'hôpital.
Ces amis ŕ vous,
ceux qui vous ont enlevés,
que pensez vous qu'ils veulent nous dire ?
ils sont beaucoup plus futés que vous,
Ce n'est męme pas amusant.
Oui, et bien...
Oui, je n'en doute pas.
Je veux dire, ils ont découvert comment vous enlever
et comment vous ramener.
Me renvoyer était une erreur, et ils le savent.
Je suis supposée ętre toujours lŕ bas.
C’est oů, exactement, "lŕ bas" ?
Il y avait aussi des docteurs lŕ bas.
Ils étaient gentils, tous gentils.
Ils étaient gentils.
Vous vous souvenez oů vous avez été emmenée ?
Nous dormions beaucoup,
mais pas tout le temps.
Nous portions des vętements gris.
Il y avait un building géant.
Les docteurs portaient des vestes brillantes.
Cela me manque tellement.
Continuez.
J'aimerais vraiment vous entendre parler de ça.
Nos chambres avaient des fenętres rondes.
De hautes portes voűtées.
Les pierres étaient gravées.
Des symboles mathématiques ou quelques choses comme ça,
des inscriptions,
des fioles de métaux violacés,
Des tiges aux bouts colorés.
Ces symboles, Tess, ŕ quoi ressemblaient-ils ?
Tess ?
Tess ? Vous souvenez-vous ce que les inscriptions disaient?
Ils attendent de mes nouvelles.
J'ai besoin d'ętre en contact avec eux.
Tess, Tess attendez...
Tess, attendez.
Garrity, pourquoi n'avez-vous pas pris votre portable ?
Je suis désolé.
C'est une peu la folie par ici.
Donc, tout va bien ?
Oui, tout va bien.
Nous avons presque fini ici.
fini ?
Et bien, l'antenne parabolique est un peu dure ŕ hisser,
mais nous y arriverons.
Allez tout le monde. Sécurisons cette antenne.
Nous n'avons pas toute la journée.
Je viens d'avoir une conversation des plus incroyables avec Tess
Et bien elle ne peut pas ętre plus incroyable
que celle que je viens d'avoir avec Garrity.
Je dois dire que je ne le vois pas de cette façon.
Il n'y a pas d'autre façon de le voir.
Ce livre est blasphématoire.
Et bien ne l'achetez pas si c'est ce que vous pensez.
"Le 3éme ange souffla dans sa trompette, et une grande
étoile tomba du paradis, brűlante comme une torche."
Révélations, chapitre 8, verset 10.
Je vais vous croire sur parole.
" Le jour de leur retour
marqua le commencement de la fin des temps. "
On dirait que vous y avez réfléchi un peu plus que moi.
Soit vous enlevez ce livre de votre magasin,
soit mon fils le fera pour vous
Un peu, qu’il le fera !
Savez vous ce que vous tenez lŕ, madame ?
C'est juste un livre.
C'est la porte de l'enfer.
C'est votre enfant ?
C'est ma fille.
Les abominations engendrent des abominations.
Richard !
Qu'est ce qui ce passe ?
Nous devons partir d'ici.
Maintenant.
Shérif, que diable se passe-t-il ?
Les nouveaux gars que vous nous avez envoyés sont nuls.
Park m'avait dit qu'il avait de l'expérience
avec les chalumeaux.
Expérience en quoi ? A allumer des feux ?
Maintenant notre programme tombe ŕ l'eau.
L'un d'entre vous a appelé les pompiers ?
Il est temps d'y aller
A suivre

Précédemment dans 4400…
Une comète ne change pas de trajectoire.
- Celle ci l'a fait.
- Alors ce n'est pas une comète.
Nous ne sommes pas sûrs de ce qui arrive.
On distingue quelque chose.
La lumière a disparue,
laissant place à des milliers de personne.
Diana Skouris. Tom baldwin.
Vous deux serez une des équipes
qui enquêtera sur les revenants.
On les laisse partir.
On les laisse partir ?
On n’a aucun droit de les retenir.
Pourquoi faire disparaître une petite fille dans les années 40,
la retenir durant 60 ans
et la renvoyer avec la capacité
de prédire l'avenir.
- Je peux rentrer à la maison ?
- La maison ?
Avec vous,
je n'aime pas être seule ici.
Shawn Farrell...
- Oncle Tommy.
- Salut.
Il est tout a vous.
Et Kyle ?
Kyle est dans le coma, Shawn.
Que diable as tu fais à Kyle ?
Je ne sais pas ce qui s’est passé.
J'ai posé mes mains sur lui. C’est tout.
Il s'est réveillé.
Tu parles d'une sorte d’effet domino ?
Diana Skouris toujours
première de la classe.
Les incidents ne sont que des catalyseurs
du changement.
Je le jure devant Dieu.
je ne te le demanderai qu'une fois…
Où est mon fils ?
- Kyle ! Kyle
- Non !
Tom, Non !
Vous n'êtes pas mon fils.
Qui êtes vous ? Qu’est ce que vous êtes.?
Je suis un humain.
Je viens d'une autre époque, votre futur.
A mon époque, l'humanité est mourante.
Seuls les revenants
peuvent empêcher la catastrophe.
C'est pourquoi ils ont été modifiés
et rendus au cours du temps.
Vous voulez dire que ce sera la fin du monde ?
- Vous devez les aider.
- Les aider ? Comment ?
Papa ?
Kyle...
Je veux fournir un endroit sûr,
pour chacun des 4400 qui le souhaite.
Sale taré.
Danny, arrête ça.
Arrête de m’accuser pour Nikki !
Je suppose que ce que je demande c'est
si je peux rester ici quelques temps.
Parle moi un peu plus
de ton pouvoir...
Je n'étais pas enceinte avant l'enlèvement,
mais je l'étais à mon retour.
Ce bébé peut-être la clef pour le futur
et doit être protégé, et je peux le faire.
Fuyez !
Je vous retrouverai.
Ce bébé m'appartient.
Isabelle...
Isabelle...
Quoi, mon trésor ?
Un cauchemar ?
Toujours le même.
6 mois plus tard
Elle va bien, Richard.
On va tous bien.
Reviens te coucher.
C'est certainement un raton laveur...
C'était qui ?
Ils sont partis
avant que j’ai pu demander.
Ils ont laissés quelque chose.
Quelqu'un nous a trouvé.
Qui ?
NTAC, Collier ?
Ça ressemble
à leur carte de visite pour toi ?
Je ne sais pas qui, mais quelqu'un
sait que nous sommes des 4400.
Commence à faire les valises.
Je vais en ville demain,
prendre ma paye et on file d'ici.
Pourquoi pas maintenant ?
On aura besoin de cet argent, Lily.
Mr et Mme Sumlin.
Peter.
Si vous voulez me suivre.
Pardon pour le décor,
le centre n'ouvre
officiellement que demain.
Peter n'a plus le temps d'attendre.
C'est là où vous avez tort, Mme Sumlin.
Peter a tout le temps du monde.
Salut, Peter.
Mon nom est Jordan Collier.
Par ici.
Notre centre hospitalier n'est pas prêt.
Nous avons pensé
que Peter serait plus à l'aise ici.
Bonjour, Peter.
Je suis Shawn.
Et  si on commençait ?
Ouais.
Ok, petit.
Prends mes mains.
Détends toi.
D’accord ?
C’est bon.
Tu le fais bien. Très bien.
C’est bon.
Oh, mon dieu,
il va bien ?
Il va très bien.
Observez.
C'est bon.
Tu vas bien. Tu vas bien.
Peter ?
Comment te sens-tu, mon chéri ?
Fiston ?
Merci
pour votre généreuse donation.
On a tout essayé.
Radiothérapie, greffe de moelle osseuse…
Est il vraiment guéri ?
Retournez voir son médecin,
faites lui passer des examens.
La leucémie de Peter est partie.
C'est un miracle.
Pour l'instant,
cela doit rester secret.
L'accord de confidentialité
que vous avez signé le stipule.
Mais les gens devraient savoir
à propos de ce jeune homme.
Et ils le sauront.
Le moment venu.
Ils sauront tout.
Très joli.
Survole le 5. Survole le 5.
- Tu es nerveuse ?
- Pas toi ?
Non, pas du tout.
Bon, peut-être un peu.
D'accord, extrêmement.
Mais tu veux vraiment faire ça, n’est-ce pas ?
O ui.
Allons-y.
Il est dit ici qu’elle a montré une capacité
de type Dinstman-Lenhoff.
Elle a des sortes de visions prémonitoires ?
Oui,  ses visions se sont arrêtés
il y a 4 mois, sans raison apparente.
Dommage,
j'allais demander si Teledex allait
exploser des prévisions trimestrielles.
On aimerait commencer
si c'est possible.
Bien sûr.
Si vous voulez signer aux endroits indiqués.
Diana Skouris, votre adoption de
Maia Rutledge est par ceci effective,
officielle, et définitive.
Attesté par moi-même, Henry Biederman,
et par le 10ème tribunal des affaires
familiales de Seattle.
Certains de nous doivent regarder
bien loin, pour trouver leur "famille".
Vous deux avez regardé
au delà du temps.
Diana laissez moi vous présentez
votre fille, Maia.
Maia, dis bonjour à Maman.
<i>Commandemant de l'Evaluation de la Menace Nationale - Seattle, Etat de Washington.</i>
Je ne le ferai pas.
Et je le pense cette fois. Y a pas moyen.
C'est juste un scanner, Kyle.
T'en as déjà eu.
Celui là va leur dire la même chose
que les 150 précédents… C'est-à-dire rien.
Il n'y a personne
d'autre que moi, là.
Je le sais,
et tôt ou tard,
ils vont arrêter de chercher.
Quand ? Quand ça ?
J'aimerais le savoir.
Mais avec le NTAC, le gouvernement,
il y a bien plus en jeux que toi ou moi, tu comprends ?
Kyle, ils veulent juste comprendre
ce qui s'est passé à Highland Beach. C’est tout.
Ils ont peur que s’ils me laissent sortir,
je révèle leur grand secret.
Ils peuvent se détendre,
je veux juste sortir d'ici
et redevenir normal.
Et les gens normaux ne radotent pas
sur le futur de l'humanité
ou sur la fin du monde.
En plus, je ne me souviens même pas
ce qu'il s'est passé.
Je sais.
Vous m'entendez ?
Je ne me souviens pas !
Calme toi.
Papa, sors moi de là.
Parle à quelqu'un,
n'importe qui. S’il te plaît, parce que…
D'accord.
C'est bon.
Ok.
Tom,
ça fait un bail, hein ?
Tu sais comment c'est.
Les bureaucrates n'ont pas beaucoup
de raison de te mettre avec un agent rebelle.
Quelqu'un s'apitoie
sur son sort aujourd'hui ?
« Le chemin de l'oubli commence ici. »
Les 4400 ont été envoyé pour sauver
l'humanité, et je suis supposé les aider...
J'étais là sur la plage, tu te souviens ?
Ils m'ont donné une mission,
Quel est ma plus belle action
de la semaine ?
J'ai convaincu
mon fils de repasser un scanner.
Et je ne suis pas sûr
que c'était ce qu'ils avaient en tête...
Diana, vous êtes prête ?
Dans une minute.
On doit contrôler 3 revenants de plus,
et je veux m'assurer
qu'on rendra le rapport avant 17h.
Pourquoi ne vas-tu pas fais chauffer la voiture ?
J'arrive.
Bien sur.
Vic Hubbard est le meilleur enquêteur
que t’aies pu trouver ?
Oh, non, c'est le 4ème cette année.
2 de plus et je bats un record.
On doit te sortir de derrière ce bureau.
Je suis déjà chanceux d'avoir un boulot ici.
J'ai braqué un autre agent,
tu te souviens ?
Ouais , bon,
j'ai pas dit que ça allait être facile.
C'est vraiment ce qui s'est passé.
Tu vas recommencer
avec les énergies négatives ?
Les trous blancs, ils sont la clef.
C'est comme ça qu’ils les ont enlevés,
et renvoyés
Mais les trous blancs... La 2ème loi de...
- Oui, parce que j’ai raison.
Voyons.
- Les gars !
- C’est comment d’avoir tort ?
J'interromps quelque chose ?
Brady en remet une couche
avec ses trous blancs, encore.
Un jour tu m'expliqueras la différence
entre les blancs et noirs.
Bien, pourquoi pas ce soir ?
Pourquoi est-ce que tu ne me donnerais
pas simplement ce dont on a parlé ?
- Je peux pas.
- Pourquoi ?
Je l'ai déjà envoyé là haut.
Je me demande si quelqu'un le lit...
Quand ce sera fait, je suis sûr
que t'en entendras parler.
Je te suis redevable, beau gosse.
<i>Hôpital Psychiatrique d'Abendson.</i>

« Les montagnes hallucinées »
Tu essayes
de me dire quelque chose.
A quel aide-soignant tu l'as volé ?
Matt ?
Arlo ?
Tu es si gentil.
Tu es la seule personne ici,
qui ne veut pas me voir morte.
J'aurais aimé t'emmener avec moi,
mais c'est impossible.
Ils ne veulent que moi.
Mais je vais partir bientôt.
Très bientôt.
Joanne ? Paul ?
Que faites vous ?
Maniaque sexuel. Ne me fais pas
ces gros yeux.
Johanne, je suis sérieux.
Pose ces trucs par terre
avant de te blesser.
On construit quelque chose.
Je le vois bien.
Vraiment ?
Ça va être gigantesque.
Enorme. Rivalisant avec les pyramides.
Mais certaines choses doivent rester
Dans l'imagination, Joanne.
En plus,
vous deux avez physiothérapie
maintenant.
Allez.
Construire quelque chose.
Construire rien du tout.
Aide moi à me débarrasser de ce foutoir.
Désolée, c'était trop fort ?
Oh, non.
Continuez, donnez le meilleur.
Quoi que vous fassiez, vous devez être
vraiment bon dedans.
Oh, oui, je travaille avec mes mains,
comme vous.
Mon appart ne ressemble pas
du tout à ici.
Ça aide d'avoir des amis bien placés.
Je suis toujours prête
à me faire de nouveaux amis.
Entrez.
En parlant du loup.
Laissez nous.
Quelqu'un vous a déjà dit
que vos arrivées était craignos ?
Si quelqu’un l'a fait, je l’ai viré.
Pour toi.
Ça sort demain.
Jordan, ça va se vendre
par million.
Les gens vont flipper
quand ils liront ça.
Les grandes idées
font beaucoup de bruit, Shawn.
Vous vouliez me voir, Nina ?
Vous couchez avec Tom Baldwin ?
Je devrais refaire une entrée, non ?
On pourrait peut-être recommencer…
Répondez à la question !
Même pas une poignée de main.
Vous lui devez de l'argent ?
Quel jeu on joue, là ?
Si je connaissais les règles...
Je joue au jeu de la salle des Théories
- Je ne connais pas celui là.
- Laissez moi vous donner un indice.
"La nécessité de l'immédiate réassignation
de Thomas Baldwin à son poste sur le terrain."
Un titre accrocheur.
Vous avez trouvé ça toute seule,
ou ce sont les cerveaux du sous sol ?
Disons que je suis d'accord avec l'idée.
Tom est le meilleur agent avec lequel
j'ai bossé, peut être le meilleur de la division.
Pendant les 3 mois ou Baldwin a enquêté
sur les 4400,
ce département en a appris plus
que durant toute cette année
où il a trié de la paperasse.
Il a menacé la vie d'un autre agent.
Il essayait de protéger son fils,
que ces hommes du futur, ou quoi qu'ils soient,
ont pris pour porte-parole.
Sans mentionner
que son neveu Shawn est un 4400.
C'est un énorme
conflit d'intérêt pour moi.
Ce  n'est pas
ce que Dennis Ryland pensait.
Dennis Ryland n'est plus en poste ici.
Vous devriez appeler Washington et
lui parler.
Je n'ai pas à appeler Washington.
On est en ligne directe.
Députés, sénateurs,
commissions, sous-commissions
tous  observent ce département, et ils m'observent,
pour avoir des réponses.
Voilà pourquoi vous ne pouvez pas
garder Tom Baldwin hors jeu.
C'est un atout majeur, dans cette affaire.
Peut être l'atout majeur.
C'est drôle,
c'est exactement ce qui est dit dans ce mémo.
Peut être que Marco m'a demandé
de vérifier la typo.
La prochaine fois que vous voulez
me faire passer un message,
mettez votre nom.
Mr Walcott !
Descendez de là.
Arlo !
Mr Walcott, descendez de là !
Arlo ! Vous avez entendu le monsieur.
Mr Walcott,
descendez tout de suite !
J'appelle la sécurité
si vous ne descendez pas immédiatement.
Arlo !
C'est votre dernière chance.
Que diable fais-tu là haut ?
Je l'ai.
Arlo !
Arlo, dernier avertissement !
Arlo, s'il te plait.
Soyez prudent !
Je descends.
Arlo attention.
Regarde ce que tu fais !
Je l'ai.
Je l'ai !
Oh, oh... oh, mon dieu.
Oh, mon dieu !
Non !
Lily, je suis rentré.
Lily, détends-toi, on n'est plus obligés de partir.
Un dingue a placardé ça dans toute la ville.
Il ne nous a pas repairé.
Je crois quand même
qu'on devrait partir.
J'avais peur hier aussi.
Mais tu as lu ça ?
C'est un délire
pas une chasse aux sorcières.
Peut-être, mais Richard,
On ne se sent plus en sécurité ici.
Tu veux dire qu'Isabelle ne
se sens plus protégée.
Richard, on en a déjà parlé une douzaine de fois.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
elle me parle qu’à moi et pas à toi...
Parle ?
Communique. Qu'importe.
Est-ce qu’elle a dit où on devrait aller ?
Elle a déjà choisi un lieu,
ou elle saura en le voyant ?
On peut trouver une ville.
On l'a déjà trouvée, ici.
Isabelle  a 6 mois.
Je sais qu'elle est spéciale,
mais nous sommes ses parents.
Nous prenons les décisions
pour elle, pas le contraire.
Je sais. Il est temps de partir d'ici.
Tu as raison.
Tu as tout à fait raison.
On reste ici.
Maia ?
c'est la fête.
Des macaroni aux fromages, de la purée
de pommes de terre, et du pain blanc.
Tout ce que j'aime.
Les seules choses que tu manges.
Promets-moi de dépasser cette phase bientôt.
Maman, comment tu fais pour que
ce soit si bon ?
Un talent caché, je suppose.
Tu viens de m'appeler maman.
Tu es ma maman maintenant, pas vrai ?
Maintenant, et pour toujours.
- J'aime bien ça.
- Moi aussi.
Tu penses que je pourrai
retourner à l'école ?
Tu n'étais pas en train de me dire
que tu as eu 97 à ton test de Maths ?
Pas l'école à domicile.
La vraie école.
Avec un terrain de jeu
et des récréations.
Eh bien, oui, tu y retourneras…
Quand tu seras un peu plus grande...
Grande comment ?
Je n'ai plus de prémonitions,
alors je devrais pouvoir être avec d'autres enfants.
Je pense que je serais heureuse à l'école.
Eh bien, tu es heureuse maintenant.
Je suis contente que tu sois ma maman pour de vrai,
- mais je pourrais quand même avoir, genre une amie ou deux.
- ahh...
Encore des macaronis au fromage, s'il te plait.
Juste un peu.
Signez ça.
Qu'est ce que c'est ?
Votre lettre de démission.
Je pensais être à nouveau sur le terrain.
Vous l'êtes.
C'est effectif immédiatement.
Je veux des résultats.
Nous avons une collection précieuse de diplômés au sous-sol
qui me disent que vous êtes le meilleur moyen d’en obtenir.
Je suis donc disposée à prendre ce risque.
Mais j'ai besoin de garanties.
Ceci.
Je n'ai pas mis de date.
Si vous dépassez les limites, je remplis la case.
C'est juste.
Bien.
Là. Regardez ça.
Tess Doerner.
Diagnostic de schizophrénie paranoïaque à l'âge de 15 ans.
Disparue de l'hôpital psychiatrique d'Abendson en avril 1955.
Laissez-moi deviner, ils l'ont renvoyée sans se soucier de la guérir ?
Guérir les gens ne faisait sûrement pas partie de leur plan.
On vient de recevoir un appel à propos de l'hôpital.
Un de leurs infirmiers est mort.
Il prétend qu'il y a un rapport.
On va vérifier ça.
Attends.
Il y a encore un élément du deal qu'on doit régler.
Vous imposez des conditions ?
C'est ta nouvelle maison ?
C'est aussi la tienne.
Toutes tes affaires sont ici. Je...
On dirait ton ancienne chambre, tu ne trouves pas ?
J'ai essayé au moins.
Il y a juste une chose qui manque...
Maman.
Je sais. Parfois je n'arrive pas non plus à croire qu'elle ne soit plus là.
Mais on a essayé, Kyle, tu sais,
on a vraiment voulu que ça marche.
J'aurais aimé que vous essayiez un peu plus sérieusement.
Désolé, c'est juste que...
Tu sais, quand quelque chose d'horrible se passe au sein d'une famille,
comme quand tu étais à l'hôpital, ça peut...
rapprocher les gens, ou bien...
les éloigner. Ta mère et moi...
Je vais devoir l'appeler, pour qu'elle sache que je suis sorti de quarantaine.
Oui, bonne idée. Tu sais, elle sera vraiment contente...
Shawn va halluciner, lui aussi.
Quoi ? Tu savais que je voudrais le voir, non ?
Tu es un bon cousin.
Ne te fais pas trop d'illusions. Les gens changent en 4 ans, tu sais.
Je n'arrive pas à croire que tu sois ici. Je...
J'ai attendu ce moment trop longtemps.
Hé...
Tu te souviens combien on aimait aller dans les cages pour frapper des balles ?
Tu n'arrivais jamais à renvoyer les balles courbes.
Moi ? Non, c'était toi,
J'ai gardé plein de monnaie, alors si tu veux...
On pourrait aussi s'arrêter au practice ?
Tu veux apprendre à jouer au golf ?
J'ai toujours voulu t'apprendre !
Il y a beaucoup de choses que je veux essayer à présent, papa.
Fais une liste. Quoique tu veuilles, on le fera.
Tout ce que tu veux.
Tu me la montreras ce soir, d'accord ?
Tu t'en vas déjà ? Je viens juste d'arriver !
C'est mon boulot, mon pote.
Tu peux commencer ta liste maintenant.
On prend vraiment les travaux manuels au sérieux ici, hein ?
Vous êtes sûr que Tess a dessiné ça avant qu'ils ne commencent à construire ça ?
Elle a fait son premier croquis il y a 2 semaines.
Ils ont commencé à monter ce truc hier.
Et vous pensez que l'infirmier qui est mort a un rapport avec tout ça ?
Arlo était sur la corniche du bâtiment B, en train de forcer pour détacher une girouette.
Je pense que c'était cette girouette.
Mais pourquoi ne confinez vous pas tous les autres patients dans leur chambre ?
Ca m'a traversé l'esprit, mais ce genre de comportement coopératif est sans précédent avec de telles maladies.
En plus, je voulais que voyiez ce truc avant qu'on ne le détruise à nouveau.
Tout va bien, Kevin.
Ils sont là pour parler avec Tess, c'est tout.
Il est très protecteur avec elle.
C'est sa seule amie ici.
Tout va bien, vraiment.
Je vais la prévenir de votre arrivée.
Bien.
Nous avons vu certains de vos dessins, Tess. Ils sont vraiment bons.
Ils vont vous entendre.
Il y a des micros dans les murs.
Ils émettent par satellite, vers les sous-marins.
Qui ça ?
Les médecins.
Les médecins de cet hôpital ?
Certains sont dans cet hôpital.
D'autres se trouvent dans le sous-marin.
D'accord, on va parler moins fort.
Ils ont pris mes crayons, mais c'était trop tard.
Ah oui ? Pourquoi ça ?
Parce que ce sera construit de toutes façons.
Ils veulent qu'on soit en contact,
c'est pour ça qu'ils ont mis les plans dans ma tête.
On parle des médecins de l'hôpital, là, ou bien de ceux
qui sont sous la mer ?
Ni l'un ni l'autre.
On parle des gens qui m'ont enlevée...
...idiot.
Donc, les gens qui vous ont enlevée...
ils veulent que les malades d'ici construisent cette tour ?
Ils feraient n'importe quoi pour me renvoyer.
Ils m'aiment bien.
C'est vous qui avez demandé de l'aide aux autres malades, Tess ?
Je n'aime pas leur parler.
Ils sont cinglés.
Est-ce qu'Arlo était cinglé ?
Je n'ai jamais pensé qu'il l'était...
mais peut-être que la folie est contagieuse.
Pour mon premier jour de reprise, avec quoi je me retrouve ?
Trois fois rien.
Juste une bande de malades mentaux construisant un engin
pour contacter le futur.
C'est ce que pense Tess en tout cas.
Elle pense aussi qu'il y a des médecins sous l'océan Pacifique,
qui écoutent une transmission radio de ses conversations privées.
Ca pourrait être un genre d'hystérie collective.
Même si ça n'explique pas le cas Arlo.
C'est un infirmier d'un certain âge que sa femme a quitté.
Ca pourrait être un suicide.
Il aurait renoncé à la dernière minute,
et se serait agrippé à la girouette ?
Je me demande depuis quand Marco n'a pas vu le soleil, tu vois ?
Je pensais qu'on pourrait l'emmener ici
jeter un oeil sur ce truc qu'ils construisent.
Une virée pour Marco ?
Il lui arrive de prendre l'air, Tom,
et puis tu sais, on pourrait facilement se procurer de la crème solaire.
Ce serait incroyable, quand même ?
Si elle pouvait vraiment le faire. Contacter le futur.
Tess a raison.
La folie est sûrement contagieuse.
Il me dictait une lettre.
Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé. Il a attrapé sa tête et a commencé à crier.
Attendez dehors. Tout de suite.
Calmez-vous. Calmez-vous.
Merci.
Elles empirent.
Jordan...
Elles reviennent plus souvent aussi.
- Ca va ?
- Je vais bien.
Je ne comprends pas. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi ces attaques
continuent de survenir.
J'ai guéri...
l'emphysème, la leucémie...
des fractures...
Ce bébé vous a vraiment mis au tapis.
Eh bien, souviens-toi de ça quand on retrouvera Richard et Lily.
On dirait que vous êtes très confiant là dessus, mais ça fait 1 an, Jordan.
J'oublie parfois qu'ils ne sont pas ici.
Moi, je n'oublie jamais,
et les hommes que j'ai payés pour les trouver non plus.
Ok, mais si j'étais vous,
je n'aimerais pas me trouver dans le même fuseau horaire que ce gamin.
Si vous vous rencontrez à nouveau,
ça pourrait vous achever.
J'ai mes raisons.
- Repose-toi maintenant, ok ?
- D'accord.
C'est un grand jour demain.
<i>En titre de ce journal,</i>
<i>des révélations à propos des origines des 4400.</i>
<i>Dans son autobiographie sortie aujourd'hui,</i>
<i>l'ancien magnat de l'immobilier, Jordan Collier, affirme</i>
<i>que les 4400 ont été enlevés</i>
<i>par des humains venant du futur.</i>
<i>Le livre contient des copies de documents gouvernementaux, dont Collier prétend</i>
<i>qu'elles prouvent ses dires.</i>
<i>Les documents viendraient d'une source anonyme au sein du commandement national de l'évaluation de la menace.</i>
<i>Selon Collier,</i>
<i>les 4400 ont été renvoyés pour empêcher la catastrophe qui menacerait la survie de l'humanité.</i>
Pourquoi tu ne m'en as pas parlé ?
<i>Collier ajoute</i>
<i>que le gouvernement avait cette information depuis plus d'un an,
mais l'a gardée secrète afin d'éviter une panique générale.</i>
<i>Le gouvernement déclare que ces documents sont
purement spéculatifs et ont été cités hors contexte.</i>
Rien à foutre de qui les a enlevés.
Rien à foutre de qui les a renvoyés. Le gouvernement aurait du les garder derrière des barreaux.
T'as pas entendu ce que ce mec dit ? Ils sont là pour sauver le monde.
Qu'est ce que tu voulais qu'il dise d'autre ? C'est l'un d'entre eux.
T'es bien silencieux.
Je ne crois que ce que je vois...
Et ce que je vois c'est que...
je dois vider ce radiateur avant le déjeuner.
Vous serez heureux d'apprendre que la source anonyme de M. Collier ne l'est plus.
L'agent Hubbard sera poursuivi dans toute l'étendue de la loi.
Qu'est ce qu'on fait avec Collier ?
Ce type a acheté des secrets d'état au marché noir.
Je suis sure que tout le monde ici voudrait voir Collier accusé de trahison, mais c'est peu probable.
Et je doute qu'on arrive à remonter les paiements jusqu'à lui.
Maintenant,
pour ce qui est de ce qu'ils appellent "le Centre 4400",
il est sous surveillance 24h/24 jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
Je veux des photos de quiconque s'approche à moins de 100 mètres de cet endroit.
Est-il exact que Collier est en train d'essayer d'obtenir un statut qui l'exonère d'impôts ?
Apparemment.
Il transforme les 4400 en une sorte de religion ?
Plutôt en un culte.
Oui enfin, c'est comme ça que les grosses congrégations
appellent une petite congrégation.
Culte, religion, peu importe. Sur quoi est-ce qu'il le base ?
Vous avez lu ce truc ?
Collier prétend qu'il peut révéler un 4400 à l'intérieur de n'importe qui.
Donc il espère qu'un gars qui pointe à Pittsburgh
va croire qu'il a un genre de superpouvoir latent ?
La plupart des 4400 n'ont même pas ce genre de capacités.
Pas encore, à vrai dire.
Non, mais si vous pensiez qu'il y a une chance
que vous ayez un pouvoir caché en vous...
On dirait que vous êtes prête à vous inscrire.
Non,
mais je ne blâmerais personne d'être curieux.
Il faut continuer à dire aux gens que, biologiquement,
les 4400 ne sont pas différents de nous autres.
Ils n'ont pas été altérés génétiquement, ni neurologiquement...
Autant qu'on puisse le dire.
Mais si Collier croit que les gens vont gager leur vie
et leurs économies pour une sorte de...
système pyramidal métaphysique, alors...
le réveil va être brutal.
Bienvenue au Centre. Je m'appelle Devon.
- Comment vous appelez-vous ?
- Kyle
Enchantée, Kyle. Je vous inscris pour une visite ?
Merci. Je cherche juste mon cousin, Shawn Farrell ?
Je suis désolée, M. Farrell n'est pas disponible pour l'instant.
Vous pourriez lui dire que Kyle le cherche ? Il vit ici, n'est ce pas ?
J'ai bien peur que nos règles nous interdisent de parler de nos membres.
Je ne cherche pas à discuter. Je veux juste saluer mon cousin.
Si vous voulez bien me laisser vos nom et numéro...
Je ne vous laisse rien du tout ! Quel est le problème ?
Il n'y a aucun problème.
Alors dites à Shawn que je suis là ! S'il ne veut pas me voir, très bien, mais c'est lui que ça regarde, ok ?
Pourriez-vous baisser d'un ton, s'il vous plaît ?
Ecoutez, je n'ai rien contre vous. Personnellement,
j'espère que vous, le robot, vous retrouverez votre corps un jour.
Si c'est ça, je trouverai Shawn moi-même.
Par ici, monsieur.
- Lâchez-moi !
- Vous devez partir.
Vous ne m'aviez pas dit que ce truc était si gros.
- Il ne l'était pas.
- Pas hier.
Et eux, on ne dirait pas que ce sont des patients.
Ils ne le sont pas.
Dr. Clayton !
Je sais ce que vous allez dire. On a pris du retard.
On rattrapera le temps perdu cet après-midi.
Bon, est-ce que tout l'hôpital travaille sur cet engin ?
C'est le seul moyen d'y arriver.
Excusez-moi.
Randy, Winston, on a besoin d'aide par ici.
Dr. Cho est de retour avec la parabole.
Ok.
Les patients d'abord, et maintenant le personnel.
S'il s'agit d'hystérie collective, c'est en train de s'étendre.
Qui c'est l'amour de papa ?
Ta maman...
et Isabelle.
Si, c'est vrai.
Tu sais ce qu'il voit quand il te regarde ?
Hein ?
Un bébé magnifique. Si, c'est vrai.
Mais maman voit bien plus que ça,
Et tu sais pourquoi ?
Parce que tu communiques avec maman.
Mais tu ne parles jamais à ton papa.
Alors qu'est ce que tu en dis ?
Tu veux dire quelque chose à ton papa ?
Hein ?
Parce que je t'écoute.
Comme tu veux.
Je suppose que j'en suis réduit à me débrouiller tout seul.
Richard. On doit acheter ce bouquin, je veux le lire.
Tout comme moi, mais j'ai regardé en ville.
Ils n'auront aucun exemplaire avant demain.
Je ne sais pas pour toi, mais je me fais à
l'idée qu'on ne saura jamais d'où elle est venue.
Eh bien, si nous sommes allés dans le futur, au moins nous sommes revenus avec un souvenir.
Les gens qui nous ont enlevés,
ils ont fait se produire tout ce qui est arrivé, n'est-ce pas ?
Ils se sont assurés qu'on ait Isabelle.
Ils doivent prévoir quelque chose pour elle.
Je prévois aussi quelque chose pour elle,
une vie normale.
Ce serait super mais,
ça fait longtemps qu'on a dit adieu à la normalité.
C'est scandaleux ! On a un travail à finir, ici. Un travail important.
Les médecins veulent travailler. Dites leur de faire leurs
visites. Personne ne les empêche de s'occuper de leurs patients.
A partir de maintenant,
- la tour et la cour intérieure sont interdites, compris ?
- Compris.
Mec, regarde la taille de ce truc.
Ca me déplairait pas d'en avoir un comme ça dans mon jardin.
Ta virée est finie. Va attendre dans la voiture.
Donc hier, quelques patients ne pouvaient pas s'empêcher de travailler sur cette chose,
et aujourd'hui, c'est l'hôpital entier.
Si on sort Tess d'ici,
est-ce que tu penses que cette aliénation va s'atténuer ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ca vaut le coup d'essayer, non ?
Ok, je te tiens.
Tout va bien.
Je ne suis pas une personne mauvaise.
Vraiment pas.
Personne n'a dit ça, Tess.
Alors pourquoi est-ce que vous allez m'enfoncer des fils dans le cerveau ?
Je te promets, Tess, que personne ne vas te faire de mal.
C'est ce que tout le monde dit, juste avant de vous faire mal.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'on me puni ? Je suis gentille. Vraiment. Je leur obéis, c'est tout.
Les gars ! Les gars ! Ramenez-vous !
Kevin !
Ok, Tess. Allons-y. Allez.
- Tout va bien.
- Kevin...
- Est-ce que tu as un 7 ?
- Tu pioches.
Je suis désolée d'être en retard.
Qui est-ce qu'on a là ?
C'est Carrie. Elle habite à l'étage en dessous.
Le monsieur d'UPS a laissé leur colis ici par erreur,
et quand sa maman est venue le chercher, Carrie était avec elle,
et maintenant je suis invitée à sa fête d'anniversaire,
et à rester dormir.
Je peux y aller, dis ?
Bonjour, Carrie.
Je m'appelle Diana.
Enchantée de vous connaître.
Enchantée de te connaître.
Je lui ai déjà dit d'accord.
Eh bien, je pense qu'on devrait d'abord en parler à la mère de Carrie, non ?
Oh, d'accord, tu sais quoi ? C'est bon tu peux y aller.
Merci, merci, merci, merci.
Vous ne m'avez jamais dit que j'étais prisonnier.
Tu as déjà vu une cellule de prison, Shawn ? Ca n'a rien à voir avec ton appartement.
Bon sang, Jordan, depuis quand est-ce que vous décidez
qui je peux voir et à qui je peux parler ?
C'est à propos de ton cousin, n'est-ce pas ?
Donc vous savez qu'il est venu.
Je sais qu'il a été grossier et agressif, et qu'il a du être escorté dehors.
Vous voulez dire jeté dehors.
Ca aurait pu se passer plus doucement, Shawn,
mais à tout prendre, je dirais que c'était mieux ainsi.
Kyle est mon ami.
Il était ton ami.
Ecoute, il y a un an, tu es venu me voir
parce que tu cherchais une nouvelle vie,
la tienne était en pagaille.
Kyle, ami ou pas,
fait partie de cette ancienne vie.
Qu'est ce que vous voulez que je fasse ?
Couper les ponts avec lui et oublier qu'il existe ?
Il n'est pas différent de ta mère, de ton frère ou de ton amie Nikki.
Je ne vous permets pas...
Ils ne comprennent pas ce qu'on essaye d'accomplir ici.
Vous savez, peut-être que moi non plus.
Alors je te suggère de prendre
tes affaires et de partir
Et que se passera t'il la prochaine fois que vous
hurlerez de douleur ?
Fais ce qui est juste pour toi Shawn,
je prendrai soin de moi.
Je viens de recevoir les résultats de Tess
Laisse moi deviner...
En bonne santé sur toute la ligne ?
Tu peux dire ça pour tous les 4400...
ils sont tous identiques.
Tess a dessiné le croquis...
d'une tour, d'un monument...
Oui, ou d'une balise...
Et les gens autour d'elle ont tout laissé tomber
et ont commencé à la construire
Ils n'ont plus de libre arbitre.
Ils doivent travailler
C'est comme chez les fourmis.
Venez ici.
La reine sécrète une substance chimique,
qui dicte aux autres fourmis ce qu'elles doivent faire
Les ouvriers ne s'arrêteront pas de travailler
tant que la tâche n'est pas terminée.
ils ne se soucient pas si l'un d'eux meurt,
ou si
une tempête arrive et balaie la fourmilière
Ils continuent simplement à travailler...
A moins que vous n'enleviez la reine.
Espérons que nos ouvriers fonctionnent ainsi.
Donc le futur nous a renvoyé
une reine fourmi schizophrène,
avec un plan pour quoi ?
Une sorte de talkie-walkie interstellaire.
Voyons ce que Tess peut nous dire.
Nous ne devrions pas trop nous en approcher,
car si ta théorie est juste,
n'importe qui exposé à elle serait vulnérable.
Bien, j'irai parler à Tess. Vous, vous vérifiez
avec Garrity à l'hôpital.
Ces amis à vous,
ceux qui vous ont enlevés,
que pensez vous qu'ils veulent nous dire ?
ils sont beaucoup plus futés que vous,
Ce n'est même pas amusant.
Oui, et bien...
Oui, je n'en doute pas.
Je veux dire, ils ont découvert comment vous enlever
et comment vous ramener.
Me renvoyer était une erreur, et ils le savent.
Je suis supposée être toujours là bas.
C’est où, exactement, "là bas" ?
Il y avait aussi des docteurs là bas.
Ils étaient gentils, tous gentils.
Ils étaient gentils.
Vous vous souvenez où vous avez été emmenée ?
Nous dormions beaucoup,
mais pas tout le temps.
Nous portions des vêtements gris.
Il y avait un building géant.
Les docteurs portaient des vestes brillantes.
Cela me manque tellement.
Continuez.
J'aimerais vraiment vous entendre parler de ça.
Nos chambres avaient des fenêtres rondes.
De hautes portes voûtées.
Les pierres étaient gravées.
Des symboles mathématiques ou quelques choses comme ça,
des inscriptions,
des fioles de métaux violacés,
Des tiges aux bouts colorés.
Ces symboles, Tess, à quoi ressemblaient-ils ?
Tess ?
Tess ? Vous souvenez-vous ce que les inscriptions disaient?
Ils attendent de mes nouvelles.
J'ai besoin d'être en contact avec eux.
Tess, Tess attendez...
Tess, attendez.
Garrity, pourquoi n'avez-vous pas pris votre portable ?
Je suis désolé.
C'est une peu la folie par ici.
Donc, tout va bien ?
Oui, tout va bien.
Nous avons presque fini ici.
fini ?
Et bien, l'antenne parabolique est un peu dure à hisser,
mais nous y arriverons.
Allez tout le monde. Sécurisons cette antenne.
Nous n'avons pas toute la journée.
Je viens d'avoir une conversation des plus incroyables avec Tess
Et bien elle ne peut pas être plus incroyable
que celle que je viens d'avoir avec Garrity.
Je dois dire que je ne le vois pas de cette façon.
Il n'y a pas d'autre façon de le voir.
Ce livre est blasphématoire.
Et bien ne l'achetez pas si c'est ce que vous pensez.
"Le 3éme ange souffla dans sa trompette, et une grande
étoile tomba du paradis, brûlante comme une torche."
Révélations, chapitre 8, verset 10.
Je vais vous croire sur parole.
" Le jour de leur retour
marqua le commencement de la fin des temps. "
On dirait que vous y avez réfléchi un peu plus que moi.
Soit vous enlevez ce livre de votre magasin,
soit mon fils le fera pour vous
Un peu, qu’il le fera !
Savez vous ce que vous tenez là, madame ?
C'est juste un livre.
C'est la porte de l'enfer.
C'est votre enfant ?
C'est ma fille.
Les abominations engendrent des abominations.
Richard !
Qu'est ce qui ce passe ?
Nous devons partir d'ici.
Maintenant.
Ok...
Shérif, que diable se passe-t-il ?
Les nouveaux gars que vous nous avez envoyés sont nuls.
Park m'avait dit qu'il avait de l'expérience
avec les chalumeaux.
Expérience en quoi ? A allumer des feux ?
Maintenant notre programme tombe à l'eau.
L'un d'entre vous a appelé les pompiers ?
Il est temps d'y aller
Vite, Richard.
Vite !
A partir de cette nuit, l'hôpital d'Abendson
est officiellement en quarantaine.
Les patients resteront enfermés.
Le personnel hospitalier et celui de l'NTAC qui a été infecté,
seront confinés dans l'hôpital jusqu'a ce que nous
isolions la source de la contamination.
Ca parait être un bon plan,
mais qui les surveillera ?
La dernière équipe que nous avons envoyée à été
contaminée en quelques heures.
Ce qui est, pour être franc,
un peu perturbant,
si vous considérez cela comme une épidémie...
Au CDC, nous appelons Tess
"le vecteur unique de la maladie."
Vous l'éloignez, vous enlevez l'envie de construire,
Excepté, autant qu’on le sache,...
qu'aucun de ces agents n'a eu de contact avec Tess.
Donc c'est comme la grippe,
ou tout autre virus aérophile.
Vous l'attrapez, vous pouvez le transmettre.
Quoi qu'il en soit, qu'est ce que cette chose est censée être ?
Mon avis, et je ne peux souligner
le mot "avis" suffisamment,
est que Tess nous a dit la vérité.
C'est une sorte de dispositif de communication.
Pour contacter qui ?
Le futur ?
La seule façon de le savoir
et de laisser les patients finir la construction.
Cette nuit là sur la plage d'Highland, ils ont essayé de
nous dire quelque chose. La conversation a été coupée trop tôt
C'est pourquoi nous sommes restés
dans le noir l'année dernière.
Tess est la seule 4400
qui se souvient où elle a été emmenée...
Non, elle prétend se souvenir où elle a été emmenée.
Elle est aussi la seule paranoïaque schizophrène,
Et cela me fait penser que vous deux
avez passé un peu trop de temps prés d'elle.
Heu, peut être que j'ai attrapé le bug aussi,
mais, heu...
Je suis d'accord avec eux.
L'avis de quarantaine pour l'hôpital reste effectif,
jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
Les gardes effectueront des rotations
pour minimiser le risque d'exposition.
Bon, où est-ce que cela nous mène ?
Jusqu'a ce que nous soyons sûrs
que la contamination ne se répand plus,
vous deux ne vous approcherez pas de ce bâtiment.
Isabelle s'est endormie.
Les jours pluvieux arrivent plus rapidement que prévu.
Tu penses qu'on les a semés ?
Je ne suis pas encore prêt à m'arrêter pour un pique-nique.
J'ai 1200 dollars ici.
Et 300 dans ma poche.
J'en ai aussi.
Nous allons devoir remplacer les vitres arrière dans la matinée.
Ce devrait-être suffisant pour aller jusqu'au Montana.
Qu'est ce que Eric a dit quand tu l'as appelé ?
Il a été un peu surpris d'avoir de mes nouvelles,
mais même en quarantaine,
il avait l'habitude de nous dire que les 4400 devaient rester soudés.
Oui, nous n'avions pas beaucoup d'autre choix,
n'est ce pas ?
La banque nous virera nos économies quand nous y arriverons.
Si les choses vont très mal, nous pouvons vendre ça.
Je t'ai donné cet anneau pour toujours.
Il semble que toi et Isabelle aviez raison.
Nous aurions du partir quand nous en avions l’occasion.
Ca va être une longue nuit.
Tu veux que je conduise un peu ?
Dors un peu.
Maia, qu'est ce qui ne va pas ?
Je suis désolée.
Je sais qu'il est tard, mais...
Maia avait vraiment envie de rentrer à la maison.
Qu'est ce qu'il y a, chérie ?
Je n'ai pas envie d'en parler.
Quelques une des filles,
pas ma fille, mais
quelques une des autres filles,
ont taquiné Maia.
Je crois qu'elle leur a dit qu'elle
avait le béguin pour Franck Sinatra.
Et bien, vu ses yeux bleus... vous lui en voudriez ?
Beaucoup d'enfants de 9 ans ne savent même pas qui était Franck Sinatra.
Je veux aller au lit.
Je pense que c'était un peu dur.
Je me sens confuse.
Peut être que Maia pourrait revenir une autre fois ?
Juste elle et Carrie.
Oui. Nous en discuterons.
Merci.
- Bonne nuit.
- Bonne nuit.
Maia.
Je sais que tu ne t'endors pas aussi vite.
C'était horrible.
Tu avais raison.
Et bien, je n'avais pas envie d'avoir raison.
Je n'ai pas besoin d'amis.
Tout le monde a besoin d'amis, Maia.
Allez, je pense vraiment que nous devrions parler de ça.
Eh bien pas moi.
Les hamburgers de chez Buck.
Aussi bon que dans mes souvenirs.
Tu as des choses étranges sur ta liste des priorités,
mais, tu sais quoi ?
Je suis heureux d'avoir pu faire que tes rêves deviennent réalité.
Kyle, tu ne devrais pas être au lit ?
Papa, j'ai 21 ans.
Oui, je dois m'en souvenir...
Je vais faire du pop-corn. T'en veux un peu ?
Tu te fous de moi.
Tu peux encore manger ?
J'ai mangé de la bouffe de quarantaine pendant un an.
Vous devez veiller à la sécurité du pays,
mais votre cafétéria pue.
Allo ?
Allo ?
Kyle.
Nous devons éloigner le bébé du froid.
Je ne pense pas qu'il y ait des hôtels sur cette route.
Je pensais nous allions plein sud,
prendre la 35éme.
Ce type devrait baisser ses phares.
C'est la première voiture que nous croisons depuis, quoi...
13 kms ?
Garde la tête baissée.
Oh, mon dieu, Richard.
C'est eux.
Tiens bon ! Tiens bon !
Tout le monde va bien ?
Oui je pense.
Ok, allons y.
Dispersez vous.
Hé, Maia, chérie.
C'est l'heure de se réveiller.
- Ok.
- Heu ?
Ce fut une longue nuit, hein ?
D'accord. 15 minutes de plus.
Tu sais quoi ?
Frank Sinatra est le plus cool,
et ne laisse personne te dire que tu es différente.
Donc tu n’en as lu aucune ?
Non, je ne voudrais pas que
ma fille lise mon journal intime.
Tu tiens un journal intime ?
J'ai raison ?
Allez, ne t’envoies pas de fleurs.
Donc tu ne sais pas vraiment
si "ce qu'elle voit" concerne...
ce qu'elle fait dans la journée,
des émissions de télé, des poneys, n'importe quoi...
ou c'est peut être "ce qu'elle voit,"
une semaine, un mois, une année au final.
Elle n'a plus eu une seule de ces visions depuis 4 mois.
Oui, c'est ce qu'elle t’a dit, en tout cas.
Pourquoi elle mentirait ?
Elle veut être normale, n'est ce pas ?
A chaque fois qu'elle fait une prédiction,
quelqu'un la traite d'anormale.
Ecoute, je comprends.
Tu es sa mère maintenant.
Il y a certaines règles.
Pourquoi je ne jetterais pas un coup d'oeil
la prochaine fois?
Tu penses que ça serait une sorte de trahison ?
Le fait de respecter la vie privée de Maia est important,
mais
tu dois mettre ça dans la balance en face des informations
que ce journal pourrait contenir.
Tu sais quoi ?
Quand tu perds la confiance en tes parents,
c'est très difficile de la retrouver,
Et oui, je parle en connaissance de cause.
Hé.
Je suis heureux que ce ne soit pas ma décision,
mais si Maia a des visions, tu devrais être au courant,
et tu devrais savoir ce qu'elles disent.
C'est grave ?
Je me la suis coincée quand on a quitté la route.
J'ai juste besoin de s’éloigner encore un peu.
Nous suivrons cette rivière vers le sud.
on marchera un peu dans l'eau,
ça leur fera perdre notre trace.
Ca sera froid.
Mais ça nous tiendra éveillé.
Après 1km nous...
retournerons sur nos pas vers l'ouest.
Droit vers l'autoroute.
Ca parait facile quand tu le dis.
Nous pouvons le faire.
Nous allons le faire, n'est ce pas ?
Fais la taire.
Elle va les mener droit vers nous.
Est ce que le nom "Gene Pecusa" te dit quelque chose ?
Oui, revenant 927.
Oh, laisse moi deviner.
Il a toujours la capacité
de transformer 20 dollars en formidable gueule de bois.
Et une nuit en cellule de dégrisement.
Allez, nous devons le ramener chez lui.
Laisse ça à Mortimer et Falcone.
Nous avons autre chose à faire ?
Non.
Tout est calme à Abendson.
Personne n'est autorisé à approcher de la tour.
C'est bien ça le problème, tu ne crois pas ?
Tom... Tom, non.
Tu te souviens
que Jarvis a encore ta lettre de démission.
Elle veut des résultats.
Je vais lui en donner.
En plus, tu veux savoir autant que moi ce que c’est que ce truc.
J'essaye de ne pas y penser.
Oui, eh bien, je ne peux pas penser à autre chose.
Donc il semblerait que Tess ait pris possession de toi.
Je n'ai pas une envie irrésistible de prendre une trousse à outils.
Je viens avec toi.
Tout va bien, Tess.
Nous vous ramenons à Abendson.
On a signé votre sortie, Tess.
Personne du NTAC ne vous+ poursuivra.
Pas vous. Les docteurs dans les sous-marins.
Ils nous observent.
Allez, quoi, tu as des remords ?
Non, entrons.
Donc, tu me dois toujours …
4 ou 5 dollars pour ces
2 packs ? Quelque chose comme ça ?
J'en ai 20 avec moi,
Si tu penses que tu peux me les prendre.
Regarde toi, vieux.
De retour parmi les vivants. Tu as l'air bien.
Je marche. Je parle.
J'ai le contrôle total de mes membres.
Tu tapes toujours comme une fille.
Rien n'a changé.
4 ans ? Plein de choses ont changées.
De quoi tu parles ?
On s'est vus juste quand tu es sorti de l'hôpital.
Je ne me souviens de rien.
De rien ?
Donc tu ne te souviens pas t'être assis à poil
au milieu des arroseurs ?
Non.
Ca ressemble plus à quelque chose que toi tu ferais.
Et bien...
Merci.
Je n'ai jamais eu la chance de le dire.
Pour m'avoir sorti du coma... Merci
Tu sais, si ça n'avait pas été pour moi,
tu n'aurais jamais été
dans ce stupide hôpital de toutes façons, alors...
Non, j'aurais été celui de nous 2 qui aurait disparu dans la colo des 4400.
Je serais peut-être revenu avec les mains magiques.
C'est bon, c'est bon. Ok.
En parlant de disparition, espèce de débile...
Kyle, ne reviens pas là dessus.
Ne reviens pas là dessus ? Ta mère est complètement flippée.
Tu ne l'as pas vue depuis 1 an. Tu n'as vu personne.
Ton frère. Mon père.
Qu'est ce qui s'est passé avec Nikki ?
Kyle, j'ai pas envie de parler de Nikki.
On s'inquiète tous beaucoup pour toi, mec.
Vous n'avez pas besoin de l'être. Je veux dire...
Je vais bien.
Je suis allé là où tu vis.
Il y a de sérieuses ondes négatives style La Firme, tu t'en rends compte, n'est-ce pas ?
Toutes ces conneries à propos de "révéler le 4400 qui est en chacun de nous..."
Et alors ?
Tu ne crois pas vraiment que Collier peut faire ça, si ?
Kyle...
Regarde autour de nous, mon pote.
Le monde est en chute libre.
Ces centres,
c'est le moyen pour rapprocher les gens, peut-être notre dernière chance.
Non seulement je crois qu'il peut le faire,
mais en plus je crois que c'est sa mission.
On dirait qu'on t'a fait un lavage de cerveau.
Il m'avait dit que tu ne comprendrais pas.
Collier ?
Oui.
Tu sais quoi ? Il avait raison.
Isabelle...
Richard !
Mon Dieu. Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Je suppose que je ne regardais pas où j'allais.
Ok. On a juste besoin de se reposer.
Tu penses que eux, ils font des pauses ?
S'il te plait, Richard.
D'accord.
5 minutes.
Ok, tout le monde, allez !
Tout le monde sort et se dirige vers la tour.
Allez.
On a beaucoup de travail, et pas beaucoup de temps, alors on y va, allez.
Allez, allez.
Allez, vous entendez ? Allons-y.
Celui là c'est pour moi. Restez dehors.
Hé, Kevin !
Regarde. Je me suis échappée.
Tu penses toujours à moi.
Kevin est un génie, vous savez,
mais il ne s'en vante pas.
Je parie que dans quelques jours, ces baies seront mûres.
Ne les manges pas maintenant.
La dernière chose dont on ait besoin, c'est d'avoir des crampes d'estomac.
Regarde.
Je croyais que tu avais dit qu'elles n'étaient pas mûres.
Elles ne l'étaient pas.
Eh bien...
C'est Isabelle ?
Sûrement.
Tu nous encourages, fillette.
Ils vont devoir travailler vite.
Je vais les aider.
C'est pas drôle, Diana.
Il faut vraiment que je le fasse.
Non, tu ne ferais que les gêner.
Tu ne comprends pas. J'ai vraiment besoin de le faire.
Faites envoyer ça chez moi.
Shawn, je te cherchais.
Ouais, je suis allé faire un tour.
Nous avons une visite particulière, ce soir.
Elle a un cancer du pancréas. Son mari
va nous faire don d'un immeuble pour un Centre 4400 à Los Angeles.
Ben, ce soir ça ne va pas être possible pour moi, Jordan.
Eh bien, tu as 5... non, 6 heures pour te mettre de bonne humeur.
L'humeur n'a rien à voir là dedans.
Je ne travaille pas ce soir, c'est tout.
Richard,
s'il te plait. Ne fais pas ça.
On a pas le choix.
Ils sont 3.
Ils vont te tuer.
Pas si j'arrive à mettre la main sur un de leurs fusils.
Tu peux à peine marcher.
C'est notre seule chance.
Je dois le faire maintenant, tant que j'en ai encore la force.
Si je ne suis pas revenu au coucher du soleil,
prends le bébé et marche tout droit vers l'ouest.
C'est par là.
Prends garde à bien suivre une ligne droite.
Compris ?
Je donnerais encore 50 ans si c'était pour te retrouver à nouveau.
Vous le saviez, n'est-ce pas ?
Savoir quoi ?
Que Baldwin et Skouris ont sorti Tess Doerner d'ici pour la ramener à Abendson.
Ils reconstruisent la tour.
Ce serait une théorie.
Ne pleures pas.
Tu ne peux pas pleurer maintenant.
Lâche ça.
Sinon je te coupe en 2.
Voilà...
Tourne-toi.
Je vous ai mieux éduqués que ça.
Lève-toi !
Diana,
où est-ce que ça en est ?
Eh bien, on dirait qu'elle est en meilleur état que je ne l'aurais pensé.
Le feu a épargné la plupart du câblage.
Donc combien de temps avant que ce soit prêt ?
Il faut qu'on finisse de trianguler les paraboles, et c'est bon.
Alors faites-le.
Baldwin.
Nous avons votre mari !
Soit vous sortez,
soit le prochain son que vous entendrez sera celui de votre mari allant
tout droit en enfer !
Je vous l'ai dit, elle est à des kilomètres...
Ouvre encore une fois la bouche, et je te coupe la langue.
Ok...
Surveille le.
Lily ! Cours !
Tu es sur de ne pas vouloir me dire au revoir ?
C'est surtout toi qui va me manquer.
Pour la dernière fois, Baldwin, ouvrez cette porte.
Je peux pas faire ça.
Vous aviez dit vouloir des résultats.
Ecoutez-moi Baldwin, vous n'êtes pas dans votre état normal.
Et ce ne sont pas les résultats dont je voulais parler.
Maintenant, reculez-vous avant d'être blessé.
Allez-y.
Non, non, attendez, attendez !
Je vous en prie, attendez.
Nous avons besoin des réponses que cette tour pourrait nous fournir.
Ecoutez-moi, je vous en prie...
Il y a un risque, je le sais.
Mais parfois, pour trouver la vérité, il faut avoir la foi...
je vous en prie écoutez-moi.
Hmmm.
Vous voulez la vérité ?
Les souvenirs du futur de Tess Doerner...
Ce ne sont pas des souvenirs.
Elle a lu la nouvelle de H. P. Lovecraft.
"The Shadow Out of Time", je l'ai avec moi.
J'ai souligné les passages qui apparaissent
mot pour mot dans ton rapport.
Encore une hallucination.
Non.
Je suis désolé Tom.
OK, allons-y. Mes hommes s'en occupent.
Que tout le monde s'éloigne de cette tour.
Isabelle...
Isabelle...
Mon fils ! Qu'est ce que vous m'avez fait faire ?
Mon Dieu, Gabriel... mon fils !
Richard !
Je n'ai pas fait ça !
Cette créature... m'a fait presser la détente.
Vous avez relâché le diable sur cette terre !
Et nous allons tous être réduits en cendre !
Richard !
Où êtes-vous ?
Où êtes-vous ?
Faisons rentrer tout le monde dans leur chambre.
On va avoir besoin de faire l'appel
avant la prochaine tournée de soins.
Où êtes-vous ?
J'ai fait ce que vous vouliez, non ?
Parlez-moi.
Allons, Tess.
Nous devrions prendre un peu de repos.
Mais ils m'ont mentie.
Ou alors c'est moi qui vous ai menti ?
Quelque part, j'en aurais voulu davantage.
Je ne sais pas ce que j'attendais.
Une autre boule de lumière,
une voix retentissante venant du ciel... enfin, quelque chose.
Est-ce qu'on a pu faire une erreur de construction ?
Peut-être.
Tout ce que je sais, c'est que
je n'ai plus envie de tenir un marteau, et il y a 10 minutes,
c'est tout ce à quoi je pouvais penser.
- Oui...
- Ok.
Le NORAD affirme que l'impulsion s'est dissipée avant de quitter l'atmosphère.
Tout ce bruit et cette fureur pour rien ?
Notre priorité à présent est d'aider le personnel à remettre de l'ordre ici.
Ok ? Et je veux que tout ceux d'entre vous qui ont été infectés par cette chose soit examinés par un médecin du NTAC.
Vous m'incluez dans cet ordre ? Parce que je ne suis pas sûr que...
Vous avez été infecté,
parce que si vous restez là à me dire que vous ne l'avez pas été,
je mets une date sur votre lettre de démission.
J'ai vraiment été infecté.
C'est bien ce que je pensais.
On ne refuserait pas un peu d'aide pour mettre de l'ordre dans cette zone,
et on doit se débarrasser de ces outils avant qu'un patient ne se blesse.
Vous l'avez entendu ?
Excusez-moi, Dr. Clayton ?
Kevin...
Est-ce que vous venez de me parler ?
Je crois que oui.
Je n'ai pas
prononcé un mot depuis longtemps, n'est-ce pas ?
Voilà 6 ans que vous essayez.
Je peux aussi penser à nouveau.
Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est produit,
mais...
je me sens...
mieux.
Vous m'avez fait suivre ?
J'aurais même pu faire enregistrer ta conversation.
Mais j'ai pensé que ce serait aller trop loin.
Bon Dieu, Kyle a raison. Je suis une sorte de prisonnier.
Je te l'ai dit, Shawn, tu peux quitter cet endroit quand tu veux.
Et je le pensais,
mais jusqu'à ce que tu le fasses,
je ne permettrai pas à ces ombres du passé d'altérer ton avis
sur ce que nous essayons d'accomplir ici. Tu es trop important.
Non, non, vous avez juste besoin de moi pour encaisser de gros chèques.
Shawn, l'argent...
est un moyen d'arriver à nos fins.
C'est le but qui est important.
Assurer le futur.
Sauver...
la planète.
Je ne peux pas y arriver sans toi.
Vous voulez une preuve que le futur fonctionne de bien étrange façon ?
Ne cherchez pas plus loin que M. Kevin Burkhoff.
Ouais, au lieu de contacter le futur, on l'a eu, lui.
Il s'avère que ce n'est pas aussi décevant que ça en a l'air au premier regard.
Burkhoff était titulaire d'une chaire de neurochimie à l'Université de Stanford.
La neuroscience.
La seule matière où j'ai eu un B.
Oui, tu n'es pas la seule.
Seule une poignée de gens sont au top d'une discipline sur une période donnée.
Notre M. Burkhoff était l'hériter désigné,
jusqu'à ce qu'il souffre de ses premières hallucinations à l'âge de 30 ans,
et qu'il soit interné 2 ans plus tard.
Sur quoi travaillait-il ?
Vous voulez un effet domino ?
Que dites-vous de ça :
Burkhoff
spécialisé dans les capacités latentes du cerveau.
Il essayait de réveiller des parties du cerveau que nous ne pouvons pas utiliser.
Des parties capables de faire quoi ?
Eh bien, des parties qui pourraient amener à toutes sortes de nouvelles capacités, comme...
la prémonition.
Exact, Marco ?
Prémonition, télékinésie,
Arrêtez-moi si ça vous semble familier.
Maia Rutledge.
Orson Bailey.
Vous êtes en train de dire que Burkhoff est le père de la technologie des 4400 ?
C'est possible.
Et l'on vient de le réveiller.
Madame Oster, de l'appartement d'à côté, va avoir un chaton.
J'espère qu'elle me laissera jouer avec lui en dépit du fait qu'un livre va sortir sur la façon dont...
... moi et Diana on va former une vraie famille...
... un ordinateur pour Noël...
...
... les chefs de maman...
Les chefs de maman seront punis pour nous avoir trahis.
Les chefs de maman seront punis pour nous avoir trahis.

Previously on the 4400...
A comet cannot change course.
- This one has.
- Then it's not a comet.
We're not sure what's just happened.
There appears to be something out there.
The light is gone, and thousands
of people have just suddenly appeared.
Diana Skouris. Tom Baldwin.
You two will be one of the teams that's responsible
for investigating what happened to the returnees.
We're letting them go.
We're letting them go?
We don't have a legal right to hold them.
Why disappear a little girl from the 1940s,
hold her for 60 years,
and then send her back with the ability
to predict the future?
- Can I go home?
- Home?
With you. I don't like
being here alone.
Shawn Farrell...
Uncle Tommy. Hi.
He's all yours.
Hey, what about Kyle?
Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.
What the hell did you do to Kyle?
I don't know what happened.
I put my hands on him. That's it.
He woke up.
You're talking about some kind of ripple effect.
Diana Skouris to the head of the class.
The incidents themselves
are just catalysts for change.
I swear to god.
I'll ask you one more time...
Where's my son?
- Kyle! Kyle!
- No!
Tom, don't!
You're not my son.
Who are you? What are you?
I'm human. I come from a different time.
Your future.
In my time, humanity is dying out.
Only those we took can prevent
the catastrophe from happening.
That's why they've been altered
and seeded back into the timeline.
You mean it's all going to end?
- You have to help them.
- Help them? How?
Dad?
Kyle...
I intend to provide a safe haven
for any 4400 in this country who needs one.
You goddamn freak!
Danny, stop it!
Stop blaming me for nikki!
I guess what I'm asking is
if I could stay here for awhile.
Tell me a little more about this...
ability of yours.
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.
That baby could be the key to the future,
and it has to be protected, and I can do that.
Go ahead! Run!
I will find you.
That baby belongs with me.
Isabelle...
Isabelle...
What is it, baby?
Bad dream?
Same one.
She's fine, Richard.
We're all fine.
Come back to bed.
It's probably just a raccoon...
Who was it?
They took off before I could ask.
They left something behind.
Someone tracked us down.
Who?
NTAC?
Collier?
This look like their calling card to you?
I don't know who it is,
but someone knows we're 4400s.
Start packing.
I'll drive into town tomorrow morning to pick up
my last paycheck, and then we're out of here.
Can't we just go now?
We're gonna need that money, Lily.
Mr. and Mrs. Sumlin.
Peter.
If you'll follow me.
Forgive our appearance.
As you know,
the Center doesn't officially open until tomorrow.
Peter doesn't have time to wait.
That's where you're wrong, Mrs. Sumlin.
Peter has all the time in the world.
Hi, Peter.
My name is Jordan Collier.
Just this way.
Our medical lab isn't quite ready,
so we thought Peter would be
more comfortable up here.
Hello, Peter.
I'm Shawn.
What do you say we get started?
Yeah?
Okay, buddy.
I want you to take my hands.
Try to relax.
Okay?
You're okay.
You're doing good. You're doing so good.
It's okay.
Oh, my god. Is he okay?
He's fine.
Just watch.
It's okay.
You're okay. You're okay.
Peter?
How do you feel, honey?
Son?
Thank you
for  your generous donation.
We tried everything.
Radiation, bone marrow transplants...
Is he really cured?
Take him back to his doctor.
Run some tests.
Peter's leukemia is gone.
This is a miracle.
For  now, it has to remain a private miracle.
May I remind you
that the confidentiality agreement
you've signed is strictly binding.
But people should know about that young man.
And they will.
In time,
they'll know everything.
Very nice.
Floating the five. Floating the five.
- You nervous?
- Aren't you?
No, not at all.
Well, maybe a little bit.
Okay. A lot.
Now, you really want to do this, right?
Right.
Let's go. Okay.
Says here she registered an ability
under the Dinstman-Lenhoff bill.
Some kind of precognitive insight?
Yes, her visions stopped about four months ago.
We're not sure why.
Oh, too bad.
I was going to ask if Teledex
will hit its quarterly projection.
Well, we'd like to get started,
if that's all right.
Certainly.
If you'll just sign where indicated.
Diana Skouris, your adoption of
Maia Rutledge is hereby complete,
legal, and binding.
So witnessed by me, Henry Biederman,
10th circuit family court of Seattle.
You know, some of us have to look far and wide
to find the people we'll call "family".
You two had to look clear across time.
Diana, let me introduce you
to your daughter Maia.
Maia, say hello to mommy.
I'm not doing it.
I mean it this time. No way.
It's just a cat scan, Kyle.
You've had them before.
This one's gonna tell them the same thing
the last 150 told them... nothing.
There's nobody in here but me.
I know that,
and sooner or later,
they're going to stop looking.
When? When?
I wish I knew,
but with NTAC, the Government, they've got
bigger issues than you or me, okay? Just...
Kyle, they're still trying to make sense about what
happened that night at Highland Beach. That's all.
They're afraid if they let me out
I'm gonna spill the beans about their big secret?
Well, they can relax,
because I just want to get out of here
and be normal again,
and normal people don't go around
sounding off about future humans
and the end of the world.
Besides, I don't even remember what happened.
I know.
You listening?
I don't remember!
Just calm down. Just calm down.
Dad,
get me out of here.
Talk to someone. Anyone.
Please, 'cause...
Sshh. Okay, okay.
Okay
Okay.
Okay.
Tom.
Been awhile, huh?
Yeah, you know how it is.
Us desk jockeys don't have much cause
to mingle with you hot-shot field agents.
Someone feeling
a little sorry for himself today?
"The path to oblivion starts here".
The 4400 were sent back to save humanity,
and I'm supposed to help them.
I was there on the beach, remember?
They gave me a mission,
and what's my biggest
accomplishment of the week?
I convinced my son to take another cat scan.
Somehow, I don't think that's
what they had in mind.
Diana, you ready to roll?
In a minute.
It's just we have to check in
on three more returnees.
I want to make sure we get our reports in by 5:00.
Okay, why don't you keep the car warmed up?
And I'll be right there.
You bet.
Vic Hubbard's the best
lead investigator you could find?
Oh, no, he's the fourth one this year.
Two more, I break a record.
We've  got to get you out from behind that desk.
I'm lucky to have a job here.
I put a gun to another agent's head, remember?
Yeah, well,
I never said it was going to be easy.
It's obvious what really happened.
Are you going to start in
with your negative energy again?
White holes. See, they're the answer.
That's how they took them,
and that's how they brought them back.
- Yeah, but white holes... the second law of...
- Yeah, because I'm right.
Come on, come on.
- Guys!
- What's it like to not be right?
Am I interrupting?
Brady's back on his "white hole" kick again.
Well, one day you'll explain to me the difference
between the white ones and the black ones, right?
Well, how about tonight?
How about you just give me
that thing that we discussed?
- Can't.
- Why not?
I already sent it upstairs.
I wonder if anyone's read it yet.
When they do, I'm sure you'll hear about it.
I owe you one, handsome.
H. P. Lovecraft's
The Mountains of Madness.
Are you trying to tell me something?
Which orderly did you steal it from?
Matt?
Arlo?
You're so sweet.
You're the only person here
who doesn't want me dead.
I wish I could take you with me when I go,
but I can't.
They  only want me.
But I'll be leaving soon.
Very soon.
Joanne ? Paul?
What are you doing?
Sex maniac.
Don't go flashing those bedroom eyes at me.
Joanne, I'm serious.
Put that stuff down before you hurt yourself.
We're building something.
I can see that.
Can you really?
It's gonna be gigantic.
Humongous.
Rival the pyramids.
But some things are better left
to the imagination, Joanne.
Besides,
you two have physical therapy now.
Let's go.
Building something...
Building nothing.
Help me get rid of this junk.
I'm sorry. Too hard?
Oh, no. Hey,
go ahead.
Give it your best shot.
Whatever you do, you must be pretty good at it.
Uh, yeah, I work with my hands.
Same as you.
My apartment doesn't look anything like this.
Well, it helps to have friends in high places.
I'm always open to making new friends.
Come in.
Speak of the devil.
Give us a moment.
Has anyone ever told you your timing sucks?
If they did, I probably fired them.
For you.
Oh...
It's in bookstores tomorrow.
Jordan, this is gonna sell,
like, a million copies.
People are gonna freak out
when they read this.
Big ideas make a loud noise
when they land, Shawn.
You wanted to see me, Nina?
Are you sleeping with Tom Baldwin?
Should I come back in?
Maybe we could start over...
Answer the question.
Never even held hands.
Do you owe him money?
Okay, what game are we playing here?
Because if I knew the rules...
I am playing the theory room paper game.
- I don't know that one.
- Well, let me give you a hint.
"The necessity for the immediate reassignment
of Thomas Baldwin to active field duty".
Catchy title.
Did you come up with it yourself,
or did the big brains in the basement pitch in?
Let's just say that I agree with the sentiment.
Tom is the best agent I've ever worked with,
maybe the best you've got in this division.
In the three months that
Baldwin was investigating the 4400,
this department learned more, far more,
than it has in the entire year
he's been shuffling paper.
He threatened another agent's life.
He was trying to protect his son,
who these future people, whoever they are,
chose as their spokesman.
That's not to mention that
his nephew Shawn is one of the 4400.
All of which sound like
major conflicts of interest to me.
That's not what Dennis Ryland believed.
Dennis Ryland is no longer in charge here.
Maybe you should call Washington and talk to him.
I don't have to call washington.
They've got me on speed dial.
Congressmen, senators,
committee chairs, subcommittee chairs,
all of them looking to this department, to me,
for answers.
Which is why you can't keep an agent
like Tom Baldwin on the shelf.
He's a major player in this case.
He's maybe the major player.
See, funny,
that's exactly what it says in this paper.
Maybe Marco had me check it for typos.
Uh, the next time that
you want to send me a message,
put your own name on it.
Mr. Walcott!
Get down from there!
Arlo!
Mr. Walcott, get down from there!
Arlo!
You heard the man!
Mr. Walcott,
Get down from there this instant!
I'm calling security
if you don't come down right now.
Arlo!
This is your last chance.
What the hell are you doing up there?
I got it.
Arlo!
Arlo, this is your last warning.
Arlo, please!
Be careful!
I'm coming down.
Arlo, be careful!
Watch what you're doing.
I got it.
I got it.
Oh, oh... oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
No!
Lily, I'm home.
Lily, relax.
We don't have to leave.
Some nut papered the entire town with these things.
He wasn't singling us out.
Well, I still think we should go.
I was scared last night too,
but did you read this?
It's a rant, not a witch hunt.
Maybe, but Richard,
we still don't feel safe here anymore.
You mean Isabelle doesn't feel safe.
Richard, we've gone over this a dozen times.
I don't know why she talks to me and not to you.
"talks?"
Communicates.
Whatever.
Did she happen to mention where we should go?
Does she have a place picked out,
or will she know it when she sees it?
We can find a town.
We already did. Right here.
Isabelle is six months old.
I know she's a special kid,
but we're still her parents.
We make decisions for her.
She doesn't make them for us.
I know. It's time
we get out of here. You're right.
You're absolutely right.
We're staying put.
Maia?
Party time.
Macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes,
and white bread.
Everything I like.
The only things you'll eat. You've got to
promise me that you'll outgrow this phase soon.
Mommy, how do you make this taste so good?
Well, it's a hidden talent, I guess.
You just called me "mommy".
You're my mom now, right?
Now and forever.
- I like that.
- Me too.
So do you think I'll ever go back to school?
Weren't you just telling me you got,
like, a 97 on your math test?
Not home-school.
Real school,
With a playground, and recess.
Well, sure you will...
You know, when you get a bit older.
How much older?
I'm not seeing things
that are going to happen anymore,
So it should be ok for me to be around other kids.
I think I'd be happy at school.
Well, you're happy now.
I'm glad you're my mom for real...
- ... but could I still use a, like a friend or two.
- Ahh...
More "Mac and Cheese", please.
Just a little.
Sign this.
What is it?
Your letter of resignation.
I thought I was being reassigned to field duty.
You are
Effective immediately.
I need results.
We have a high-priced collection
of sheepskin in the basement
that tells me you're the best way to get them.
So I'm willing to take a risk.
But I need some insurance.
This.
I left the date blank.
You cross the line, I fill it in.
Fair enough.
Good.
Here. Look at this.
Tess Doerner.
Diagnose of paranoid schizophrenia
at the age of 15.
Disapeared from
Abendson Psychiatric Hospital in April of 1955.
Let me guess, they sent her back
without bothering to cure her?
Curing people was not part of their agenda.
We just got a call
from the C.A. over the hospital.
One  of their orderlies is dead.
He claims that there's some kind of connection.
We'll check it out.
Hold on.
There's still one piece of business
we need to get straight.
You're setting conditions?
This is your new house?
It's yours too.
Well, all your stuff is here. I...
Kind of looks like your old place, huh?
Well, I tried, anyway.
Only one thing missing,
Mom.
Yeah I know.
Sometimes I can't believe she's not here either.
But we tried, Kyle, you know, we...
we really tried to make it work.
I wish you both would have tried a little harder.
I'm sorry, it's just...
You know, when something terrible happens to a family,
like when you were in the hospital, it can...
bring people closer together or...
drive them apart. Your mom and me...
I'll have to call her,
let her know I’m out the quarantine.
Yeah, you should do that.
You know, it'd make her really happy...
Shawn is gonna freak out too.
What? You know I’m gonna see him, right?
You're a good cousin.
Just don't expect too much.
You know, people change in four years.
I can't believe you're standing here. I...
I've been looking forward
to this moment for too long.
Hey...
You remember how we used to love
to go to the batting cages?
You never could hit that curve ball.
Me? No, it was you,
And I got plenty of quarters saved up, so...
Maybe we should stop off at the driving range too.
You want to learn how to play golf?
I used to beg to teach you!
Lot of things I want to try now, dad.
You make a list. You want it, and we'll do it.
Anything.
You can show me tonight, okay?
You're leaving? I just got here!
That's my job, buddy.
Now, get started on that list.
You people really take
your arts and crafts seriously, don't you?
You're sure Tess drew this
before they started building?
Ske made her first sketch 2 weeks ago.
That thing started going up yesterday.
And you think that the orderly
who died is connected to all of this?
Arlo was on the ledge of "B" building
prying loose a weather vane.
I believe it was this weather vane.
So why don't you just confine
all the other patients to their rooms?
Well, I've been tempted, but this kind of cooperative
behavior, it's unheard of with these illnesses.
Besides, I wanted you to get a look at that thing
before we tore it down again.
It's all right, Kevin.
They're just here to talk to Tess.
He's very protective of her.
She's his only friend in here.
Really, it's okay.
I'll just let her know you're coming.
Great.
We saw some of the pictures you did, Tess.
They're really good.
They'll hear you.
There's microphones in the walls.
They broadcast by sattellite to the submarines.
Who does?
The doctors.
The doctors here in the hospital?
Some of them are in the hospital.
Some of them are stationed on the submarine.
All right, we'll just talk really softly.
They took my crayons away, but they're too late.
Yeah? Why's that?
Because it's gonna get built anyway.
They want me to get in touch with them,
that's why they put the plans in my head.
Huh, now, are we talking about the doctors
here in the hospital or the doctors
under the sea?
Neither
We're talking about the people who took me...
... stupid.
So the people who took you...
they want the patients here to build that tower?
They'll do anything to get me back.
They like me.
Did you ask the other patients for help, Tess?
I don't like talking t them.
They're crazy.
Was Arlo crazy?
I never thought he was...
but maybe crazy is catching.
So my first day back, and what's going on?
Nothing much.
Just a bunch of mental patients building
a machine to contact the future.
Well, that's what Tess thinks, anyway
She also thinks there are doctors
stationed under the pacific ocean,
listening to a radio broadcast
of her private conversations.
Could be some kind of collective hysteria.
Doesn't explain this guy Arlo, though.
He's a middle-aged hospital orderly whose wife
just left him. It could have been suicide.
Lost his nerve at the last minute,
tried to grab the weather vane?
I wonder how long it is since
Marco got some sun, you know?
I was thinking we could bring him down
to have a look at that thing they're building.
A road trip for Marco?
He goes outside, Tom,
but, you know, we could have some sunblock handy.
It would be something, though, huh?
If she could actually do it. Contact the future.
Tess is right.
Maybe crazy is catching.
He was dictating a letter.
I don't know what happened.
He just grabbed his head and started screaming.
Wait outside. Now.
Hold still. Hold still.
Thanks. Thank you.
They're getting worse.
Jordan...
They're coming more often too.
- You're okay?
- I'm fine
I don't get it.
I don't get why these attacks keep coming back.
I've cured...
... emphysema, leukemia...
... broken bones...
That baby really kicked your ass.
Well, you just remember that
when we find Richard and Lily.
You sound pretty confident,
Jordan, but it's been a year.
Sometimes I forget they're still out there.
I never forget,
and neither do the men I'm paying to find them.
Okay, but if I were you,
I wouldn't want to be
in the same time zone as that kid.
If you two meet up again,
it might just finish you off.
I have my reasons.
- Now, get some rest, okay?
- Alright.
Big day tomorrow.
In the breaking news,
revelation about the origins of the 4400.
In his newly published autobiography,
former real estate mogul, Jordan Collier, claims
that the 4400 were abducted
by human beings, from the future.
The book contains copies of
classified government memoranda, that Collier says
prove his claims.
The documents are said to come from an anonymous
source within the national threat assessment command.
According to Collier,
the 4400 were returned to avert a catastrophe
that threatens the survival of mankind.
Why didn't you tell me?
Collier charges
that the government has had this information for
more than a year, but has kept it secret
in an effort to avert a public panic.
The government claims that the documents are purely
speculative and have been quoted out of context.
Don't care who took them.
Don't care who sent them back.
The government should have kept them behind bars.
Didn't you hear what the man said?
They're here to save the world.
What do you expect him to say?
He's one of them.
You're awful quiet.
I deal in facts...
And the fact is,
I've got to flush this radiator before lunch.
You'll be happy to hear that Mr. Collier's
anonymous source is anonymous no more.
Agent Hubbard will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.
So, what about Collier?
Guy bought national secrets on the black market.
I'm sure we'd all like to see Collier
charged with treason, but it's unlikely.
I doubt we'll be able to trace
the payments directly to him.
Now...
... as for this so-called "4400 Center"...
Round-the-clock surveillance is
in effect until further notice.
I want pictures of everyone who comes
within a hundred yards of that place.
Is it true that Collier's filing
for tax-exempt status?
Apparently.
He's turning the 4400 into some kind of religion?
More like a cult.
Well, "cult" is what the big congregation
calls the little congregation.
Cult, religion, whatever. What's he basing it on?
Have you read this thing?
Collier claims that he can unlock
the 4400 within anybody.
So he expects a guy punching a clock in Pittsburgh
to believe he has some kind of latent superpower?
Most of the 4400 don't even have
those kinds of abilities.
Not yet, anyway.
No, but if you thought there was a chance
that you had an ability locked away inside you...
You sound like you're ready to sign up.
No,
but I wouldn't blame anyone for being curious.
We keep telling the public that biologically,
the 4400 aren't any different than the rest of us.
They haven't been altered genetically, neurologically...
As far as we can tell.
But if Collier thinks people
are just going to sign their lives
and their life savings over to some...
metaphysical pyramid scheme, then...
He's in for a rude awakening.
Welcome to the Center. My name's Devon.
- What's yours?
- Kyle.
Nice to meet you, Kyle. Can I sign you up for a tour?
Huh, thanks. I'm just looking
for my cousin, Shawn Farrell?
I'm sorry, Mr. Farrell's not available right now.
Could you tell him Kyle's looking for him?
He does live here, right?
I'm afraid policy prohibits me from
discussing our membership.
I'm not looking for a discussion.
I just want to say hi to my cousin.
If you'd like to leave your name and number...
I'm not leaving anything!
What's the problem here?
There's no problem.
Then tell Shawn I'm here! If he doesn't want
to see me, fine, but that's up to him, right?
Would you lower your voice, please?
Look, I've got nothing against you. Personally,
I hope the pod people return your body to you someday.
If it's all the same, I'll find Shawn myself.
This way, sir.
- Get your hands off me!
- You have to leave.
You guys didn't tell me this thing was so big.
- It wasn't.
- Not yesterday.
And those don't look like patients to me.
They're not.
Dr. Clayton!
I know what you're going to say.
We're falling behind.
We'll make up the time this afternoon.
So is the entire hospital working on this thing?
It's the only way to get it done.
Excuse me.
Uh, Randy, Winston, we need a little help here.
Dr. Cho's back there with the satellite dish.
Okay.
So first the patients, now the staff.
If this is some kind of mass hysteria, it's spreading.
Who does daddy love?
Mommy...
... and Isabelle.
Yes, he does.
You know what he sees when he looks at you?
Huh?
A beautiful baby. Yes, he does.
But mommy sees much more than that,
And you know why?
Because you communicate with mommy.
But you never talk to daddy.
So how about it?
Anything you want to say to daddy?
Huh?
Cause I'm listening.
Okay, then.
Guess I'm left to muddle along all alone.
Richard. We got to get a copy
of that book. I want to read it.
You and me both, but I checked in town.
They won't have any copies till tomorrow.
I don't know about you, but I kind of got used
to the idea we'd never know where she came from.
Well, if we went to the future,
at least we came back with a souvenir.
The people who took us,
they made all this happen, right?
They saw to it that we got Isabelle.
They must have something in mind for her.
I have something in mind for her too,
a normal life.
Sounds good but,
we left normal behind a long time ago.
This is outrageous! We have work
to finish here. Important work.
The doctors want to work. Tell them to make their rounds.
No one's stopping them from taking care of their patients.
Now on...
- ... the tower and the courtyard
are off-limits, you got it?
- Got it.
Man, look at the size of that thing.
Wouldn't mind having one of those in my backyard, huh?
Road trip's over. Wait in the car.
So yesterday, a few patients were compelled to work on this thing,
and today it's the entire hospital.
If we get Tess out of here,
do you think this compulsion will fade?
I don't know.
It's worth a try, isn't it?
All right, I got you.
It's okay.
I'm not a bad person.
I'm not.
No, no, no one's saying you are, Tess.
Then why are you going to stick wires in my brain?
I promise, Tess. No one's going to hurt you.
That's what everyone says, right before they hurt you.
Why am I being punished? I'm a good person.
Really. I'm only doing what they want.
Guys! Guys! Get over here!
Kevin!
Okay, Tess. Let's go. Come on.
- It's all right.
- Kevin...
- Do you have a seven?
- Go fish.
I am so sorry I'm late.
Who do we have here?
This is Carrie. She lives downstairs.
The U.P.S. man left their package
with us by mistake,
and when her mom came to get it,
Carrie was with her,
and now I'm invited to her birthday party,
and it's a sleep-over.
I can go, right?
Hi, Carrie.
I'm Diana.
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I already said it's okay.
Well, I think we should probably talk
to Carrie's mom first, don't you?
Oh, look, you know what? It sounds fine to me.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
You never told me I was a prisoner.
Have you ever seen a prison cell, Shawn?
It looks nothing like your apartment.
Goddammit, Jordan, since when
do you decide who I see and talk to?
This is about your cousin, isn't it?
So you did know he was here.
I know he was rude and aggressive,
and had to be escorted from the premises.
You mean thrown out.
It might have been handled more smoothly, Shawn,
but all in all, I'd have to say it was for the best.
Kyle is my friend.
He was your friend.
Look, a year ago, you came to me looking for a new life,
your old one in shambles.
Kyle, friend or not,
is part of that old life.
So what do you want me to do?
You just want me to cut him loose
and forget he exists?
He's no different than your mother,
your brother, or your friend Nikki.
Don't you...
They do not understand what it is
we're trying to accomplish here.
You know, maybe I don't either.
Well, then, I suggest you pack your bags and...
Leave.
So, what happens next time
you start screaming out in pain?
Do what's right for you, Shawn.
I'll take care of myself.
I just got the full medical workup on Tess.
Let me guess...
Physically normal across the board.
You can say this for the 4400...
They're consistent.
Tess draws a picture of a...
a tower, or a monument...
Yeah, or a beacon...
And the people around her drop everything
and start building it.
Well, they can't help themselves.
They have to work.
It's like ants.
Come here.
The queen secretes a chemical,
tells the other ants what to do.
The drones don't stop working until
the job is done.
Doesn't matter if one of them dies,
or if
a storm comes and washes away the anthill.
They just keep working...
Unless you take the queen away.
Let's hope our drones respond the same way.
Right, so the future sent back
a schizophrenic queen ant
with a blueprint for what,
some interstellar walkie-talkie?
Let's see what Tess can tell us.
We'd just better not get too close,
because if your theory's right, anyone
who gets exposed to her could be vulnerable.
All right, I'll talk to Tess.
You check in with Garrity at the hospital.
These friends of yours,
the ones who took you,
what do you think they want to talk about?
They're so much smarter than you,
it isn't even funny.
Yeah, well...
Yeah, I don't doubt it.
I mean, they figured out how to take you
and how to send you back.
Sending me back was a mistake, and they know it.
I'm supposed to be there.
Where exactly is "there?"
There were doctors there too.
They were nice. All of them.
They were nice.
You remember where you were taken?
We slept a lot, but not all the time.
We wore gray clothes.
There was a giant building.
The doctors wore shiny jackets.
I miss it so much.
Go on.
I really like hearing you talk about it.
Our rooms had round windows.
High doorways with arches in them.
The stones had writing in them.
Math symbols or something,
inscriptions,
jars of purplish metals,
and rods with stained tips.
These symbols, Tess, what did they look like?
Tess?
Tess, do you remember
what the inscriptions said?
They're waiting to hear from me.
I need to get in touch with them.
Tess. Tess. Just wait...
Tess, just wait.
Garrity, why haven't you been
picking up your cellphone?
I'm sorry.
It's been kind of crazy down here.
So is everything all right?
Yeah. Fine.
We're just about done here.
Done?
Well, the satellite dishes are a bitch to hook up,
but we'll get 'em.
Come on, people. Let's get those
dishes secured. We don't have all day.
I just had the most unbelievable
conversation with Tess.
Well, it couldn't have been any more unbelievable
than the one I just had with Garrity.
Can't say I see it that way.
No other way to see it.
That book is blasphemy.
Well, don't buy it if that's how you feel.
"The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great
star fell from heaven, burning like a torch".
Revelations 8:10.
I'll take your word for it.
The day they came back
was the beginning of the end times.
Sounds like you've done a little more thinking
on it than I have.
Either remove the book from the store,
or my boy here will remove it for you.
Like hell he will!
Do you know what you're carrying there, woman?
It's just a book.
It's the doorway to hell.
That child yours?
That's my daughter.
Abomination begets abomination.
Richard!
What's going on?
We've got to get out of here.
Now.
Ok...
Sheriff, what's the hell happen?
These new guys you sent us are no good.
Park told me he had experience with a welding torch.
Experience at what? Starting fires?
Now our schedule's in the toilet.
Did either of you call the fire department?
Time to go.
Hurry, Richard.
Hurry!
As of tonight, Abendson State Hospital
is officially under quarantine.
The patients will remain locked down.
Hospital staff and affected NTAC personnel
will be confined to the site until we've
isolated the source of the compulsion.
That sounds like a good plan,
but who's going to watch over them?
The last group we sent was compromised
within hours.
Which is, quite frankly,
a little disturbing.
If you think of this like an epidemic...
In the CDC, we'd call Tess
"the sole disease vector".
You remove her, you remove the urge to build,
except as far as we know...
None of those agents had any contact with Tess.
So it's like the flu,
or any other airborne virus.
You catch it, you can pass it on.
What is this thing supposed to be, anyway?
My guess, and I cannot emphasize
the word "guess" strongly enough,
Is that Tess is telling us the truth.
It's some kind of communication device.
To contact who?
The future?
The only way to find out
is to let the patients finish building it.
That night on Highland Beach, they were trying to
tell us something. The conversation was cut short.
Which is why we've been stumbling
around in the dark this last year.
Tess is the only 4400
who remembers where she was taken...
No, claims to remember where she was taken.
She's also the only paranoid schizophrenic.
And it sounds to me like you two have been
spending a little too much time around her.
Well, maybe I caught the bug too,
but, uh...
I agree with them.
The quarantine orders at the hospital
remain in effect until further notice.
The guards will rotate shifts to minimize their exposure.
So where does that leave us?
Until we're sure the compulsion's
not spreading anymore,
you two aren't going anywhere near that facility.
Isabelle's asleep.
Rainy day came sooner than expected.
Do you think we lost them?
I'm not ready to stop for pie just yet.
I got 1,200 here.
Another 300 in my pocket.
I'm carrying two.
We're going to have to get those back windows
replaced in the morning.
This should be enough to carry us
through to Montana.
What did Eric say when you called him?
He was a little surprised to hear from me,
but even back in quarantine, he used to say
how us 4400s should stick together.
Yeah, we didn't have much choice back then,
though, did we?
The bank will wire us our savings
when we get there.
If things get really bad, we can sell these.
I put that ring on you forever.
Guess you and Isabelle were right.
We should have taken off when we had the chance.
It's gonna be a long night.
You want me to drive a shift?
Get some sleep.
Maia, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
I know it's late, but...
Maia really wanted to come home.
Why is that, sweetie?
I don't want to talk about it.
Some of the girls,
not my daughter, but
some of the other girls,
were teasing Maia.
I guess she said she has a crush on Frank Sinatra.
Well, ol' blue eyes. Do you blame her?
Most nine-year-olds don't even know
who Frank Sinatra was.
I want to go to bed.
I guess it got pretty nasty.
I feel terrible.
Maybe Maia can come back another time?
Just her and Carrie.
Yeah. We'll talk about it.
Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Maia.
I know you didn't fall asleep that fast.
It was awful.
You were right.
Well, I didn't want to be right.
I don't need any friends.
Everyone needs friends, Maia.
Come on, I really think we should talk about this.
Well, I don't.
Buck's burgers.
Good as I remembered.
Kind of a strange thing to have on top of your list,
but hey, you know what?
I'm glad I could make your dreams come true.
Kyle, shouldn't you be in bed?
Dad, I'm 21.
So I have to keep reminding myself.
I'm making some popcorn. You want some?
You're kidding me.
You could eat more?
I've been eating quarantine food for a year.
You guys might be keeping the country safe,
but your cafeteria sucks.
Hello?
Hello?
Kyle.
We got to get the baby out of the cold.
I don't think there's any motels on this road.
I was thinking we'd head south,
catch the 35.
Guy should lose his high beams.
That's the first car we've seen in, what, like,
15 miles?
Get your head down.
Oh, my god, Richard.
It's them.
Hold on! Hold on!
Everybody okay?
Yeah, I think so.
Okay. Let's go.
Spread out.
Hey, Maia, sweetie.
It's wake-up time.
- Okay.
- Huh?
It was a late night, huh?
All right. 15 more minutes.
You know what?
Frank Sinatra is the coolest...
... and don't you let anyone
ever tell you're different.
So you didn't read any of it?
No. I wouldn't want
my daughter reading my diary.
You keep a diary?
Am I in it?
Come on, don't flatter yourself.
So, really, you don't even know
if "what she sees" means...
... things during the day,
tv shows, ponies, whatnot...
Or it could be "what she sees"...
... a week, a month, a year down the line.
She hasn't had one of those visions
in, like, four months.
Well, that's what she tells you, anyway.
Why would she lie?
She wants to be normal, right?
Every time she makes a prediction,
someone calls her a freak.
Look, I understand.
You're her mom now.
There are certain protocols.
Next time I'm over, why don't I take a peek?
You think that'd be any less of a betrayal?
Respecting Maia's privacy is no small thing,
but
you've got to weigh that against the information
that could be in that diary.
You know what?
When you stop trusting a parent,
it's really hard to start again,
And yes, I'm speaking from experience.
Hey.
I'm glad it's not my decision,
but if Maia's having visions,
you should know about it,
and you should know what they are.
Is it bad?
I just jammed it when we spun out.
Just need to walk it off a little more.
We'll follow this stream south.
Hike through the water a bit,
throw 'em off our trail.
It'll be cold.
It'll keep us awake.
After a mile, we'll...
we'll double back west.
Head straight for the highway.
Sounds easy when you say it.
We can do it.
We're going to do it, right?
Keep her quiet.
She's going to bring them right to us.
Does the name "Gene Pecusa" ring a bell?
Yeah, returnee 927.
Oh, let me guess.
He still has the ability
to turn 20 bucks into a crushing hangover.
And a night in the drunk tank.
Come on, we've got to ferry him back to his halfway house.
Give it to Mortimer and Falcone.
We got something else on our plates?
No.
Everything's quiet at Abendson.
No one's been allowed near the tower.
That's the problem, isn't it?
Tom... Tom, no.
You do remember that Jarvis has still
got your letter of resignation.
She wants results.
I'm going to give them to her.
And besides, you want to know
what that thing is as badly as I do.
I'm trying not to think about it.
Yeah, well, I can't think of anything else.
So it sounds like Tess has got her hooks in you.
I don't have the urge to pick up a tool belt.
I'm coming with you.
It's all right, Tess.
We're taking you back to Abendson.
We signed you out, Tess.
No one from NTAC is coming after you.
Not you people. The doctors in the submarines.
They're watching us.
Come on, what, you're having second thoughts?
No, just get in.
So you still owe me
four or five dollars for those two
six-packs? Something like that?
I've got a 20 right here,
if you think you can take it from me.
Look at you, man.
Back among the living. You look great.
I walk. I talk.
I seem to have full control of my limbs.
You still hit like a girl.
Nothing's changed.
Four years? Plenty's changed.
What are you talking about?
We saw each other right when you got out of the hospital.
I don't remember any of that.
You don't?
So you don't remember sitting naked in the sprinklers?
No.
Sounds like something you'd do.
Well...
Thank you.
I never got a chance to say that.
For getting me out of the coma... thank you.
You know, if it hadn't been for me,
you wouldn't have been
in that stupid hospital anyway, so...
No, I'd have been the one who disappeared into 4400 boot camp.
Maybe I'd have come back with the magic hands.
All right, all right. Okay.
Speaking of disappearing, you jerk...
Oh, Kyle, don't go there yet.
Don't go there?
Your mom is so freaked out.
You haven't seen her in a year.
You haven't seen anybody.
Your brother.
My dad.
What was going on with you and Nikki?
Kyle, I don't want to talk about Nikki.
We're all really worried about you, man.
You don't need to be.
I mean,
I'm fine.
I've been to that place where you're living.
There are some serious Stepford Wives vibes going on there, you know that, right?
All that stuff about
"unlocking the 4400 inside everybody..."
Yeah?
You don't really believe Collier can do that, do you?
Kyle...
Look around us, man.
The world is in a total freefall.
These centers,
they're a chance to bring people together,
maybe our last chance.
I don't just believe that he can do it.
I believe that he has to do it.
Sounds like someone got inside your head.
He said you wouldn't understand.
Collier?
Yeah.
I got to tell you, man, he was right.
Isabelle...
Richard!
God. What happened?
Guess I wasn't looking where I was going.
Okay. We just need to rest.
You think they're stopping for breaks?
Come on, Richard.
Alright.
Five minutes.
All right, people, come on!
Everyone out to the tower.
Come on.
We've got a lot of work to do, and not a lot of time to do it,
so let's go, come on.
Go, go.
Come on, you heard me. Let's go.
This one's mine. Stand over there.
Hey, Kevin!
Look. I escaped.
Always thinking of me.
Kevin's a genius, you know,
but he doesn't brag about it.
I bet in a couple of days all
these berries will be ripe.
Don't eat them now.
The last thing we need is to start cramping up.
Look.
I thought you said they weren't ripe.
They weren't.
Well...
Isabelle?
Had to be.
Way to go, little girl.
They're going to have to work fast.
I'm going to help them.
That's not funny, Diana.
I really want to do this.
No, you'd only be in the way.
You don't understand.
I really need to do this.
Have these sent to my house.
Shawn, I've been looking for you.
Yeah, I took a walk.
We have a special visitor tonight.
She has pancreatic cancer.
Her husband
is willing to donate real estate
for a 4400 center in Los Angeles.
Well, tonight doesn't really work for me, Jordan.
Well, you have five...
no, six hours to get in the mood.
Mood's got nothing to do with it.
I'm just not working tonight.
Richard,
please.
Don't do this.
We don't have another choice.
There's three of them.
They're going to kill you.
Not if I get my hands on one of those shotguns.
You can barely walk.
It's our only chance.
I've got to do it now,
while I still have the strength.
If I'm not back by sundown,
take the baby and walk due west.
It's that way.
Just keep going in a straight line.
Understand?
I'd give up another 50 years if it meant finding you again.
You knew about this, didn't you?
Knew about what?
Baldwin and Skouris signed Tess Doerner out of here
and took her back to Abendson.
They're rebuilding the tower.
That would be one theory.
No crying.
You can't cry now.
Drop it.
I'll cut you in half.
Yeah...
Turn around.
I taught you boys better than this.
Get up!
Diana,
how's it going?
Well, it turns out we're in better shape
than I thought.
The fire missed most of the wiring.
So how soon till it's ready to go?
Well, we've got to finish triangulating the dishes,
and then we're good.
Just get it done.
Baldwin.
We've got your man!
Either you come out,
or the next sound you hear
is him being blown
straight to hell!
I told you, she's miles away by...
Open your mouth again,
I'll cut your tongue out.
Okay...
Watch him.
Lily! Run!
Are you sure you don't want to say
goodbye to me?
I'm gonna miss you most of all.
Last time, Baldwin, unlock the door.
Can't do that
You said you wanted results.
Listen to me Baldwin, you are not in your right mind.
These are not the results that I was talking about.
Now step away before you get hurt.
Take it.
No, no, just wait, wait!
Just wait, just wait...
We need answers that tower might provide.
Just listen, listen to me...
It's a risk, I know.
But sometimes when you want to get to the truth
you have to take a leap of faith, just...
just listen to me.
Hmmm.
You want the truth?
Tess Doerner's memories of the future...
They're not memories.
She read the mini-short story by H. P. Lovecraft.
"The Shadow Out of time", I have it right here.
I underlined some of the passages that show up verbatim in your report.
Just another delusion.
No.
I'm sorry Tom.
Ok, let's go, okay, guys take it.
Everyone step away from that tower.
Isabelle...
Isabelle...
My son! What did you make me do?
Gabriel, my god... my son!
Richard!
It wasn't me!
That creature... made me pull the trigger.
You've unleashed the Devil into this world!
And we all are going to burn!
Richard!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Let's get everyone back in their rooms.
We're gonna need a full head count before the next round of medications.
Where are you?
I did what you wanted, right?
Talk to me.
Come on, Tess.
We all could use a little rest.
But they lied to me.
Or did I lie to you?
Well, somehow I wanted more.
I don't know what I expected.
Another ball of light,
a booming voice from the sky... something.
Could we have built it wrong?
Maybe.
All I know is that
I don't feel like picking up a hammer anymore,
and 10 minutes ago,
that was all I could think of.
- Yeah...
- Alright.
NORAD said the pulse dissipated
before it left the atmosphere.
Could be all this sound and fury
was for absolutely nothing.
Now, our first priority is to help the hospital
personnel restore order here.
Okay? And then I want all of you who were infected
with this thing to be checked out by NTAC medical.
You including me in that order?
Because I'm not sure...
You were infected,
because if you're standing here telling me you weren't,
I'm putting a date on that letter of resignation.
I was definitely infected.
I thought so.
We could use a little help policing the area here,
and we need to get rid of these tools
before one of the patients hurts themselves.
You heard the man.
Excuse me. Dr. Clayton?
Kevin...
Did you just speak to me?
I guess I did.
I haven't
said anything for a long time, have I?
Try six years.
I can think again too.
I don't know what happened...
... but...
... I feel...
... better.
You had me followed?
I could have had your conversation recorded.
I just thought that might be pushing it.
God, Kyle's right.
I am some kind of prisoner.
Shawn, I've told you,
you can leave here anytime you want,
and I meant it,
but until you do,
I will not allow these shadows from your past
to alter your perceptions
of what it is we're trying to accomplish here.
You're too important.
No, no, you mean you need me
to help bring in the big checks.
Shawn, the money...
... is a means to an end.
The goal is what matters.
Ensure the future.
Save...
... the planet.
I can't do that without you.
You want proof the future works in mysterious ways?
Look no further than Mr. Kevin Burkhoff.
Yeah, instead of contacting the future,
we got him.
Well, not as disappointing as it might seem at first blush.
Burkhoff was a tenured professor of neurochemistry at Stanford university.
Neuroscience.
Only class I ever got a "b" in.
Yeah, you're not alone.
Only a handful of people work at the top of the field at any given time.
Our Mr. Burkhoff was the heir apparent,
until he suffered his first delusion at the age of 30,
and he was institutionalized two years later.
What was he working on?
You want a ripple effect?
How's this...
Burkhoff
specialized in dormant neural pathways.
He was trying to wake up parts of the brain
that we can't use.
Parts that would do what?
Well, parts that could lead to all kinds of special new abilities,
like...
... precognition.
Right, Marco?
Precognition, Telekinesis...
Stop me if any of this sounds familiar.
Maia Rutledge.
Orson Bailey.
You're saying that Burkhoff is the father of the 4400 technology?
It's possible.
And we just woke him up.
Miss Usher, next door, is getting a kitten.
Hope she'll let me play despite the fact there's going to be a book about how we all...
... me and Diana get to be a real family...
... a computer for Christmas...
... mommy's bosses...
Mommy's bosses will be punish for betraying us.
Mommy's bosses will be punish for betraying us.
Précédemment dans "The 4400"…
Nous ne sommes pas sûrs de ce qui arrive.
La lumière a disparue,
laissant place à des milliers de personnes.
- On les laisse partir.
- On les laisse partir ?
On n’a aucun droit de les retenir.
Vous êtes enceinte ?
Je n'étais pas enceinte
quand j'ai été enlevée,
mais je l'étais à mon retour.
- C'est quoi tout ça ?
- A quoi ça ressemble, d'après vous ?
Ce bébé pourrait être la clé de notre futur,
et il doit être protégé,
et je peux le faire.
C'est ça, fuyez !
Ce bébé m'appartient.
C'est ta nouvelle maison ?
C'est la tienne aussi.
J'ai attendu ce moment
pendant si longtemps.
Diana Skouris, votre adoption
de Maia Rutledge est par ceci effective,
officielle et définitive.
Ses visions ont cessé il y a environ 4 mois.
On ne sait pas vraiment pourquoi.
Mme Usher, de l'appartement d'à côté,
va avoir un chaton.
Les chefs de maman seront punis
pour nous avoir trahis.
Ce n'était pas moi !
Cette créature m'a fait
presser la détente !
Tu commences à t'habiller
par le casque, maintenant ?
C'est comme ça qu'ils font
chez les Mariners ?
Les Mariners ?
Gary a plutôt des vues sur les Sox.
Tu veux dire que les Sox
ont des vues sur lui.
Comment tu te sens,
avec ces recruteurs dans les gradins ?
Tu te penches pour refaire tes lacets,
ils prennent des notes.
Et si tu lui montrais
un peu de respect ?
Tu es en présence
du nouveau Jackie Robinson.
Le premier 4400 à entrer
en ligue nationale.
T'inquiète pas à propos
des recruteurs, mec.
Je te ferai des passes bien au centre.
Prends bien ton rythme,
et oublie même qu'ils sont là, d'accord ?
<i>On peut pas lui en vouloir.
Six recruteurs.</i>
<i>Moi j'aurais tellement la trouille
que j'étoufferais.</i>
Je n'étoufferai pas.
<i>Ca commence aujourd'hui.</i>
<i>... La justice a un sens...</i>
<i>... Négro !...</i>
<i>... Impossible ! Impossible !...</i>
Barnes ne peut pas
mieux servir que ça.
Donne moi juste une seconde.
<i>Il lui lance une balle molle.</i>
<i>Il a peur.</i>
<i>C'était quoi le problème
avec celle-là ?</i>
<i>Quel loser.</i>
<i>Va jusqu'au bout.
Va jusqu'au bout.</i>
<i>Cette fois, essaye de sortir
la batte de tes épaules.</i>
Ca te dirait de tâter de ma batte ?
C'est quoi ton problème, Gary ?
Navarro ! Remets-toi dans le jeu.
Concentre toi.
Je veux voir du contact.
<i>La Ligue Nationale ?</i>
<i>Ce gamin n'a même pas l'air d'être prêt
pour des balles de débutants.</i>
Ferme la !
Est-ce que tout le monde
va se la fermer...
que je puisse me concentrer ?
Whoa, Gary...
Prends le un cran en dessous.
<i>T'es un cas, toi, hein ?
Vas-y. Frappe-moi.</i>
Je resterai là planté devant toi.
Je ne vais pas te frapper !
Qui a parlé de frapper, mec ?
Ca suffit, Navarro.
T'as fini pour la journée.
Je veux te voir dans mon bureau
après l'entraînement.
Je n'ai aucun problème.
Je n'ai aucun problème.
Continue de marcher, mon vieux.
Je n'ai aucun problème !
Continue de marcher, mon vieux.
Tout de suite.
- Détends-toi.
- Ne me touche pas !
<i>Ce gamin n'est pas prêt.</i>
<i>C'était une sacrée perte de temps.</i>
<i>...qu'il aille à la douche...</i>
<i>Prêt pour la Ligue Nationale, mon cul.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce qui n'allait pas ?</i>
Fermez-la !
Fermez-la !
Vous allez la fermer !
Vous allez la fermer !
Fermez-la !
Je  n'ai aucun problème !
Je n'ai aucun problème !
Eh bien, cet endroit est mieux
qu’un fossé dans les bois.
Pas de beaucoup.
C'est juste pour un jour ou deux,
pour laisser Isabelle se reposer, ensuite,
on finira le reste de la route.
On a assez pour arriver
jusqu'à White Bird ?
Avec une nouvelle voiture,
un voyage aux urgences...
ça va être juste.
Fuir et se cacher tout le temps,
parfois j'oublie
qu'on n'a rien fait de mal.
Il y a 3 homes morts dans les bois
qui te contrediraient.
Tu veux aller te doucher en premier,
ou je peux y aller ?
Vas-y d'abord.
Tu donnes le biberon à Isabelle, d'accord ?
D'accord.
C'était toi, n'est-ce pas ?
C'est toi qui as arrêté
ces hommes dans les bois ?
Hein ?
Papa aimerait bien savoir.
Mais tu ne vas rien me dire,
n'est-ce pas ?
ce qui te fait rire ?
Marmaduke.
On peut avoir un chien ?
Oh, habile, la façon dont tu glisses ça
dans la conversation.
Non.
Skouris.
April.
Wahou !
Non, non, non. Je suis...
ravie d'avoir de tes nouvelles.
Tu es ma soeur.
C'est juste que...
ça fait un bail, c'est tout.
Non, on est ici,
on prend le petit-déjeuner.
Reste en ligne une seconde.
Mme  Lannox a dû oublier ses clefs.
J'y vais.
Non, non, non, je m'en occupe.
Continue de manger.
Je dois faire entrer
la maîtresse de Maia.
J'arrive  !
Encore une seconde.
Surprise ?
April...
Comment tu vas, soeurette ?
Bien.
Tu as l'air en forme.
Oui, toi aussi.
Merci.
ce que tu fais ici ?
L'expo d'art corporel
de la Pacific Northwest.
J'ai un stand.
Ne me dis pas que tu n'as pas
encore pris tes tickets ?
Euh... non.
Bonjour.
Oh mon dieu, tu dois être Maia.
April Skouris, le mouton noir de la famille.
Di', tu as tellement de chance.
Regarde moi cette jolie
petite fille que tu as.
Et pas d'accouchement,
pas de vergetures,
pas de couches...
pas de mari emmerdant.
Oh attends,
Ca c'était moi.
Comment ça se fait que je ne t'ai
jamais rencontrée avant ?
- C'est compliqué.
- On a été très occupées.
Ok, tenons-nous en à "occupées".
Peu importe.
Je suis là maintenant.
Où est-ce que tu es descendue
pour ton séjour ici ?
Le canapé a l'air confortable.
Ce n’est pas une exécution, Shawn.
La dernière fois que
je suis monté sur scène,
c'était en CM1 pour
un concours d'orthographe.
Nous intéressons ces gens.
Ils veulent écouter ce qu'on a à dire.
Tu trouveras bien quelque chose.
Bonsoir.
Je m'appelle Shawn Farrell,
et je suis un des 4400.
Wahou, euh...
il y a quelques mois, je n'aurais jamais cru
que quelqu'un applaudirait sur ces paroles.
Mais on ne savait pas alors,
ce que nous savons maintenant.
L'avenir de l'humanité est en danger,
et c'est ici,
avec votre aide,
que nous allons commencer
à remettre les choses en ordre.
Si vous nous rejoignez...
M. Collier,
M. Dravitt est ici pour vous voir.
Merci.
... la meilleure partie de vous-même.
Ian.
Merci de me recevoir.
Voilà un endroit intéressant.
Je ne vais pas être enlevé
par des aliens, n'est-ce pas ?
Non, Ian.
Ce n'était pas des aliens.
- Ils venaient du futur.
- Je sais. Vous me l'avez répété
jusqu’à la nausée. Ecoutez, tout ça
n'est que du divertissement pour moi.
Donc,
me voilà ici. Et vous voilà.
Et si on retournait à nos affaires ?
Ian Dravitt.
Fondateur et PDG d'Executive Projections,
une multinationale basée au Zimbabwe.
Si votre société veut faire des affaires
avec un pays du tiers-monde,
ils vous montrent les ficelles.
Tout ceci est parfaitement légal.
Oui, à première vue,
mais la véritable fortune
de Dravitt vient
d'activités mercenaires
et du trafic d'armes.
Il a vendu à l'I. R. A des lance grenades,
et des mines au phosphore blanc
aux guérilleros du Chemin Lumineux au Pérou.
Alors qu'est-ce qu'il vend à Collier ?
Bonne question,
mais notre équipe de surveillance
n'arrive même pas à dire
à quelle heure Collier déjeune.
Au-delà du lobby,
cet endroit est un mystère.
Je veux dire, on a envoyé nos agents
déguisés en installateurs de climatisation,
en réparateurs de fibre optique...
Oui, quand on installe un micro,
il est arraché avant la fin de la journée.
Ils sondent sûrement le bâtiment
toutes les deux ou trois heures.
Aussi longtemps que Collier
ne fait que rencontrer Dravitt...
tout ce que nous pouvons faire,
c'est deviner.
Vous pensez qu'il stocke des armes ?
Des armes, de l'anthrax,
rien ne me surprendrait.
Collier ne fait que clamer qu'il est
en guerre contre le gouvernement américain.
Il pourrait être en train d'établir
un périmètre de défense autour du Centre.
Comme ça, si jamais on avait
à se rendre là-bas, il serait prêt.
Pense au suicide collectif de Waco.
A celui de Jonestown.
Jarvis.
Je les envoie là-bas.
M. Navarro ? Je suis l'agent Skouris,
et voici l'agent Tom...
S'il vous plaît...
Je vous en prie ne parlez pas.
Il y a trop de bruit.
Vos voix et vos pensées, elles sont
comme diffusées en même temps.
Le rapport des urgences dit
que vous parlez sans cesse de...
Aucune parole.
Concentrez-vous sur ce
que vous voulez me demander,
et je vous entendrai.
Il y a quelques semaines.
C'était pendant un match.
Je pouvais entendre
les pensées de tout le monde.
Au début, c'était juste le lanceur,
ce qui m'arrangeait bien, en fait...
puisque je savais à l'avance
ce qu'il allait lancer avant qu'il lance.
J'ai marqué 5 points sur 5.
Deux home-runs,
deux simples et un double.
- C'est exactement...
- Chut...
Oui,
oui, c'était super
quand ça a commencé.
Mais je ne peux pas le contrôler.
D'abord, c'était toute l'équipe, ensuite
tout le gradin, et après,
je sais pas, c'était...
tout le monde.
c'est comme un océan de bruit qui vient
percuter l'intérieur de ma tête.
Je veux que quelqu'un fasse
en sorte que ça s'en aille.
C'est ça que je veux.
J'étais tellement près...
d'arriver à rentrer en Ligue Nationale
quand ça m'a pris.
Cette fois je vais y arriver.
Je dois y arriver.
Alors quoi, Navarro arrive vraiment
à lire dans les pensées ?
Je crois que le mot que vous
cherchez, c'est "télépathe"
Eh bien, appelez-le autrement
si ça vous rend mal à l'aise,
mais cet homme savait vraiment
à quoi on pensait.
Hmmm, quel don intéressant.
J'arriverais à imaginer quelques
applications pratiques pour ça.
Le Dr. Ostman lui a donné
de l'Halopéridol.
Ca l'a calmé,
et apaisé un peu le bruit.
Il peut vivre aussi longtemps
qu'il est sous antipsychotiques ?
On n'aura pas à lui faire essayer
une camisole de force,
mais il ne va pas pouvoir non plus
frapper des balles de base-ball, ce qui est
son seul désir.
D'accord, je vais mettre l'équipe
médicale du NTAC là dessus.
S'ils peuvent aider, ils le feront.
Super.
- Kyle Baldwin.
- Numéro de sécurité sociale ?
Le voilà.
Baldwin...
Rien.
Vous n'avez pas le droit de vous inscrire.
Mais si, je l'ai reçu le semestre dernier.
J'ai eu une dérogation.
Votre tuteur n'a pas été payé.
Quoi ? Mon père a envoyé un chèque.
Non.
Paiement effectué par : aucun paiement.
Baldwin.
Heureux de vous avoir.
J'ai la demande de transfert
pour Navarro. Vous signez,
et il sera soigné par le NTAC.
Ouais, je le ferais,
mais pas encore.
Pourquoi  pas ?
Bien, on veut savoir
ce que Collier et Ian Dravitt font.
Un 4400 qui peut lire dans les pensées
nous le dira.
Vous voulez utiliser Navarro
comme une taupe ?
Est-ce même légal ?
D.  C. l'a autorisé.
Et l'étique ?
Ce type nous a demandé de l'aide.
Il nous supplie, bon sang.
On l'aidera.
Mais il nous aidera d'abord.
Et s'il dit non ?
Vous lui ferez dire oui.
Pardon.
On peut avoir une autre couverture ?
Celles qu'on a sont plutôt minces.
Oui, elles sont plutôt minces, mais
si vous voulez la ramener,
je vous l'échangerais.
Je crois qu'on aura besoin des deux.
Vous pensez en avoir besoin,
mais vous ne les aurez pas.
Il y a autant de couvertures
que de chambres.
Et vous avez les vôtres.
Mon bébé a froid.
Je peux avoir une autre couverture,
s'il vous plait, pour
qu'elle ne tombe pas malade ?
Je vous donne 5 dollars.
Je suis bonne poire
pour un joli minois.
Il n’était pas très sympa, hein ?
Voilà.
Merci.
Et s'ils m'attrapent ?
On vous suivra pas à pas.
On implante un petit émetteur-transmetteur
dans votre oreille
sous la peau
ça prend 10 minutes,
pas de traces.
Si les choses tournent mal,
on arrive comme la cavalerie.
Quand j'étais môme, heu
Ma série favorite était
”Des agents très spéciaux”
30 ans en arrière d'un coup.
Mon petit frère prend sa retraite
de la police de Tacoma en fin d'année.
Il a 53 ans.
Les types avec qui je jouais  ?
Ceux qui ont réussi
à devenir professionnels...
Signent des autographes
dans des spectacles...
Jouer, c'est tout ce que j'ai.
J'avais compris.
Vous avez joué ?
En dernière année de fac, je me suis
démis le genou en glissant sur une marque.
Quelle position ?
3ème base.
Une autre infidélité ?
Ça vous manque ?
Tout le temps.
Mais ce qu'on fait ici,
Gary,  ce qu'on vous demande...
C'est...
Ce n’est pas le mondial,
mais c'est...
c'est important.
Je fais ça pour vous...
Vous allez me soigner ?
Vous avez ma parole.
Ok.
Désolé d'avoir manqué le dîner.
Un nouveau cas.
Je suis content que
tu n’aies pas attendu.
C'est pour ça que tu es désolé ?
Le dîner ?
Demande moi comment était
ma première journée de fac ?
Comment était
ta première journée de fac ?
Je ne l'ai pas eue.
Personne n'a payé mes droits.
De quoi tu parles,
bien sûr que si, c'est ridicule.
J'ai essayé de t'appeler un paquet de fois,
mais tu ne répondais pas.
J'étais en réunion toute la journée,
mais j'ai fait ce chèque.
C'est super, papa.
Désolé, Kyle, j'ai dû oublier.
On en a parlé des mois,
comment as-tu pu oublier ?
Voilà, amène le demain,
j'écris un mot.
Où je parlerais à l'admission,
ce que tu veux.
Voilà.
Kyle ! Ne t'en vas pas.
Juste... Ecoute.
Je l'admets.
Je ne le nie pas, j'ai merdé,
mais le boulot me rend cinglé...
Le boulot ?
Je l'attendais celle-la.
C'est comme avant, finalement.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Lily ?
C'est quoi ?
Tu as...
dépensé tout l'argent pour ça ?
Quoi ?
Parle moi.
La caisse enregistreuse du Motel...
était ouverte...
Et on avait besoin de nourriture.
Et Isabelle a besoin de couches
Tu as volé de l'argent ?
C’est pas comme si je l’avais prémédité,
mais j'ai du supplier
pour une couverture.
Et la caisse était ouverte, alors...
Il est parti en te laissant
avec la caisse ouverte ?
Il l'avait fermé, je pense,
je ne sais plus...
C'était fermé et puis...
et puis c'était ouvert.
C'est quand même du vol !
Je ne veux pas vivre comme ça.
Regarde autour de toi ?
Je n'avais pas prévu
de vivre comme ça non plus.
Je sais que c'était mal.
Ce n'est pas la peine de me le répéter.
Arrête de secouer la tête.
Mange un peu, d'accord ?
Ça serait stupide de gâcher
toute cette nourriture.
Commence.
Je n'ai pas faim.
Ce n’était pas super ?
J'ai aimé, merci.
Vous étiez où,
le mot disait juste "sorties".
Plein d'endroit, l'embarcadère,
le périph', et même le ferry.
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait...
Non !
Je t'avais dit qu'elle aurait peur !
Calme toi, c'est des décalcos.
C’est des "faux".
Mais ils sont chouettes, hein ?
Très chouettes.
Pourquoi tu ne vas pas
faire tes devoirs ?
Je suis préoccupée.
Tu aimes au moins le T-shirt ?
Et au fait...
Tu vis à Seattle et tes enfants
ne savent pas qui est Kurt Cobain ?
Quel est ton problème, Di ?
Mais dieu merci, tu lui parles des tatouages
et des rocks stars suicidaires.
Et au fait,
qui t'a donné la permission
de lui faire manquer l'école ?
Je suis sa tante.
Je ne pensais pas en avoir besoin.
Si tu renvoies sa prof pour la journée, oui.
Assise à la table de la cuisine
toute la journée ?
C'est une grande perte.
De quoi tu protèges cette gosse ?
Si j'avais besoin de ton opinion
pour élever ma fille, je te le dirais.
Maman ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, mon coeur ?
Je crois que je vais vomir.
Elle a mangé quoi ?
Tout ce qu'elle voulait.
Oh.
Bien vu, tante April.
Ok, les gars, j'entre.
Collier va vouloir te rencontrer
si tu es un des 4400.
Tout ce que tu pourras apprendre
sur lui est utile,
mais l'objectif principal est Ian Dravitt.
Vois ce que tu peux apprendre sur lui.
Pourquoi il est là.
Tu as pour 2 semaines d'Halopéridol.
Tu garderas l'esprit clair, mais si tout
va bien tu seras sorti dans quelques jours.
Pardon.
<i>Mignon. Jolies chaussures.</i>
<i>Le tenir éloigné des brochures.</i>
Bienvenue au centre.
Je m'appelle Devon.
Je suis Gary Navarro.
Je suis plutôt intéressé
par ce que vous faites ici.
Je serais ravie de vous faire visiter.
Vous avez lu le livre de Mr. Collier ?
Pas besoin, je l'ai vécu.
Je suis un des 4400.
Alors, bienvenue chez vous.
Gary Navarro,
Jordan Collier.
Je suis ravi de vous rencontrer.
C'est une poignée de main ferme.
Je ne m'attendais pas à moins,
d'un joueur de deuxième base.
Comment le saviez-vous ?
C'est mon métier
de tout savoir sur les 4400.
Donc...
Vous avez trouvé quelque chose ?
Une capacité ou...
Non, pas moi,
Je passe déjà pas mal de temps
à taper une balle rapide.
C'est frustrant, non ?
Toutes ces années perdues ?
<i>Pas de capacités. Le repasser à Devon.
Revenir à Dravitt.</i>
Jordan, nous devons parler.
Absolument, Shawn.
Mais avant, je te présente
un de nos revenants,
Gary Navarro, Shawn Farrell.
- Bonjour.
- Comment allez-vous ?
Shawn est plus chanceux
que vous et moi.
Il est revenu
avec une aptitude incroyable.
Je suis béni, c'est bon,
voyez l'auréole autour de ma tête.
Je dois vraiment te parler.
Donnez nous une seconde.
J'ai fais des recherches sur Internet.
J’ai trouvé des trucs que vous avez besoin
de savoir, parce que, laissez moi vous dire
j'espère vraiment que vous les ignorez.
Si ça peut être trouvé par un moteur
de recherche, je le sais déjà.
Vous êtes bien avec ce Dravitt ?
Les yeux sur la récompense,
tu t'en souviens ?
Faire des affaires avec des amis,
n'en fais pas des amis.
<i>Dravitt n'est pas mon ami,
c'est un dangereux taré.</i>
Je te retrouve dehors dans 10 minutes,
le temps que Gary s'installe.
On va en parler.
C'est reparti.
Bonjour ?
Bonjour ?
Vous allez bien ?
C'est quoi ?
Très lointain, je pense.
Premier jour et déjà déconnecté ?
Juste perdu, et en retard.
A demander ma route pour des classes
où je n’ai même pas envie d’aller.
Pas un très bon jour, alors.
"Introduction sur les nouvelles du 19ème."
Achevez moi.
Peut-être que ça va vous intéresser,
plus que vous ne l'imaginiez.
Rien de tel, c'était le seul module
disponible sur cette période.
Bien, c'est la salle Olin.
Prenez les escaliers à votre gauche.
Merci.
Peut-être à plus tard.
On ne sait jamais.
Bonjour tout le monde,
je suis Wendy Paulson
Bienvenue à l'introduction
sur les nouvelles du 19ème.
Tout le monde est dans le bon cours ?
Je vous parlerai après les cours.
Je n'entends rien,
je vais m'approcher.
Gary, vous faites quoi ?
Collier et ce gamin, votre neveu,
Je pense qu'ils discutent de Dravitt.
Où êtes vous ?
Gary, rentrez à l'intérieur.
Une bonne vue ?
Je suis juste...
On ne devrait pas le récupérer ?
Non, pas encore.
Il peut peut-être en apprendre plus.
Que faites-vous ?
Lâchez le.
Soyez plus attentif à ceux que vous
laissez entrer dans votre manoir, fiston.
Nous avons arrêté cet homme,
par politesse...
Jordan,
Ce sont des malfrats.
Pas besoin de nous nommer.
On a mis la main sur ce type
en train de vous espionner.
J'ai des questions pour vous, c'est tout.
J'ai vu que vous vous disputiez,
je devais faire quoi,
vous interrompre ?
Vous voulez savoir de quoi nous parlions ?
Parce que ce n'est pas un grand secret.
Je vais vous dire,
- ... précisément nous parlions...
- Shawn, c'est assez...
Vous allez trouver que je suis
tout le temps trés occupé Gary,
Si vous avez des questions,
n'importe qui de mon personnel...
sera heureux de vous aider
Oui, désolé,
la prochaine fois je le saurai.
Très bien.
Retournez à l'intérieur.
<i>Il faut faire attention où il traîne.</i>
<i>Personne ne se mettra
entre moi et 30 millions de dollars.</i>
Richard ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Les flics.
Oh, mon dieu.
Je suis désolée.
Je leur dirai que c'est moi
qui ait pris l'argent.
Tu n'as rien à voir avec ça.
Police, ouvrez !
Donnez nous une minute !
Ouvrez. Maintenant !
Ils ne sont pas après nous.
Allez !
C'est bon.
Les mecs ? Vous êtes là ?
Allez-y, Gary
Oui, désolé d'avoir coupé
le contact aussi longtemps.
Ils m'ont mis en classe toute la matinée.
Je n'ai pas vu Collier de toute la journée
ou cet autre type.
Bien, c'est bon.
Vous êtes allé où ils vous ont dit d'aller.
Oui, mais je pensais que vous aviez dit que
vous vouliez en savoir plus à propos
de l'argent que Collier a allongé ?
Où sont mes médicaments ?
Gary, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Mes médicaments, ils ont disparus.
Je n'ai pas…
Laissez moi vous montrer
Ok, ça sera bien.
Heu, excusez moi ?
Je, heu, j'avais une prescription,
quelques tranquillisants dans ma chambre
et maintenant ils ont disparus.
Vous n'en avez pas besoin.
Vous avez été conditionné
pour penser que vous en aviez besoin.
Prendre quelque chose
qui supprime vos dons
est contraire à notre programme.
Peut être devriez vous lire encore
"Purification et Nutrition" jusqu'à la fin.
Vous avez entendu ça, Baldwin ?
Ils ont pris l'halopéridol !
Oui, Gary, J'ai entendu.
Vous voulez arrêter ?
Vous voulez quitter les lieux ?
Tout est seulement, seulement...
plus fort dans ma tête...
Ca empire déjà.
Les voix commencent
à traverser les murs.
Calmez-vous, Gary.
Nous viendrons vous chercher si besoin.
C'est votre appel qui en décidera.
Gary, parlez-moi.
Ok. Hum...
V- V-Vous n'allez pas mettre
fin au deal, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui. Bien sûr.
Ok, ok.
je vais, heu, je vais continuer.
Je me tiendrai tranquille, et je vais tenir
aussi longtemps que possible.
Bien. Nous sommes avec vous.
Maintenant, écoutez, Gary, Quelqu'un sera
à l'écoute 24h/24, vous vous en souviendrez ?
Ok, d'accord.
D'accord.
J'ai, heu,
j'ai lu "le secret partagé"
la nuit dernière.
Comme votre programme le recommande.
C'est un bon début.
Eh bien, pas juste
les 20 premières pages.
Je me suis vraiment mis dedans.
Je l'ai lu entièrement.
Les nouvelles du 19éme siècle, pas forcément
l'enfer auquel vous vous attendiez ?
Ca n'a pas du tout été ennuyeux.
Bien que, j'ai beaucoup de questions.
Ok, d'accord, je serai dans mon bureau
mercredi de 13h à 16h.
Ok, d'accord, j'essayerai de m'y arrêter.
Ou nous pourrions aller au "Coop" et
prendre quelques cafés ?
Maintenant ?
J'aime parler de Joseph Conrad.
C'est pourquoi j'ai choisi ce métier.
Où as-tu appris à faire tout ça ?
Maman ne nous a jamais
appris à cuisiner.
Je ne sais pas.
J'ai seulement appris comment...
être meilleure que toi
pour certaines choses.
Tante April,
est-ce que tu as des enfants ?
Non.
Pas d'enfants.
Tu es mariée ?
Je l'étais. Demande à ta mère
ce qu'elle pensait de mon ex-mari.
Ne commence pas.
Tu ne l'aimais pas ?
Pas plus qu'April apparemment.
Elle est restée avec Trevor
pendant quoi, 7 mois ?
Tu ne l'as pas aimé dès le 1er jour.
Tu ne lui as laissé aucune chance.
Je ne pense pas qu'il méritait une chance.
Il était...
un genre de débile.
Il avait 22 ans.
Montre moi un mec
qui ne soit pas débile à 22 ans.
Il savait que tu le détestais,
Et ça ne nous a pas rendu les choses
plus faciles pour rester ensemble.
Allez. Tu ne peux pas toujours
m'en vouloir pour ça. Je veux dire,
grandit un peu.
Ok, c'était une erreur.
Je pensais que c'était
une bonne idée de venir ici,
mais il est évident que j'avais tort.
Je rassemble mes affaires. Il y a un
petit hôtel juste en haut de la rue.
Non !
C'est bon, chérie,
nous nous verrons toujours...
Mais l'électricité va être coupée cette nuit
et tu n'auras pas de lumière.
De quoi parle-t-elle ?
Puis-je être excusée ?
Mr. Navarro,
quelque chose ne vas pas ?
Ce n'est pas bon.
J'ai besoin de mon halopéridol.
Où est Collier ?
Mr. Collier est à une réunion.
Mr. Navarro ?
Mr. Navarro...
Gary, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Je vais juste parler à Collier.
Ce n'est pas une bonne idée, Gary.
Mr. Navarro...
Il est à une réunion !
Arrêtez ça.
S'il vous plait, arrêtez ça.
Arrêtez ça.
J'ai besoin de mes médicaments.
Peut importe ce qui vous arrive, fiston,
nous l'arrêterons.
Compte dessus.
Un 4400 qui peut lire les pensées ?
Donc vous avez un don.
Vous n'auriez pas dû
me mentir, Gary.
Vous voulez dire...
que ce mec sait ce que je pense ?
Parce que je n'aime personne d'autre
que moi à l'intérieur de ma tête.
Jordan, ce mec est l'un des notre.
Nous ne pouvons pas rester là
et le regarder se faire tuer.
Personne ne tuera personne.
Premièrement, nous devons déterminer
ce que notre homme sait.
Et ensuite, nous discuterons de son sort.
Car il y a des choses que je sais
qui pourraient vous faire tuer !
Qui pourraient tous vous faire tuer.
Appelez Jarvis.
Dites lui qu'on y va.
Ecoutez, Ian…
Fermez la !
Fermez la, maintenant !
Bonjour. Je suis Evan.
Bienvenue dans le centre des 4400.
Le second étage
n'est pas ouvert aux visiteurs.
Nous ne sommes pas des visiteurs.
Hey, mec, regarde, moi aussi j'ai un badge,
et c'est une propriété privée.
Qu'est-ce qu'il lui fait ?
Laissez le,
ou Dieu me vienne en aide,
je ferai gicler vos cervelles
sur tout votre plancher si propre.
Maintenant, s'en est assez.
Jetez cette arme ! Maintenant !
Comment êtes-vous entrés ici ?
Vous ne paraissez pas
si heureux de nous voir.
Eh bien, maintenant.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce bordel ?
Des agents de l'NTAC.
Je n'apprécie pas que le gouvernement
intervienne dans mes affaires.
Vous devriez faire attention
avec qui vous traitez.
Ils n'achètent pas des armes.
Ils projettent un coup d'état à l'étranger,
dans un pays minuscule.
Tu as envoyé un espion ici,
oncle Tommy ?
Beau travail.
Tu as failli nous faire tuer.
Vous aussi, Mr. Dravitt.
Bien, ça sera intéressant de voir
si les accusations de vos amis
tiennent le coup devant un tribunal.
Je suppose que je suis le seul à devoir
faire attention avec qui je fais affaire.
Shawn, tu peux venir avec nous si tu veux.
Super.
Je dirai à ta mère
que tu lui dis bonjour.
Gary,
vous auriez dû venir me voir d'abord.
Je vous aurais bien mieux traité
qu'ils ne le feront jamais.
<i>Nous sommes en guerre ici.</i>
<i>Ne choisit pas le coté perdant.</i>
Regarde ce mignon petit bébé.
Je crois que quelqu'un
veut essayer ton jouet, Walt.
Je pense que vous avez raison.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Tu la remets dans la voiture ?
Pourquoi ?
Maintenant, s'il te plait.
Quel est ton problème ?
Ce petit garçon était gentil avec elle.
Je voulais juste
que personne ne soit blessé.
Blessé ?
Qui aurait été blessé ?
Et si elle n'avait pas voulu
rendre le jouet ?
Qu'est-ce qui se serait passé ?
Ne me regarde pas comme si
tu ne savais pas de quoi je parle.
Ces trois hommes dans les bois...
Ils voulaient nous voir morts.
Tu as vu ce qui leur est arrivé.
C'était Isabelle.
Nous le savons tous les deux,
et ça ne mène à rien
de prétendre le contraire.
Peut importe ce qu'Isabelle fait,
elle le fait par amour pour nous.
Elle est notre fille, Richard.
Je le sais.
Je l'aime tout autant.
Mais elle est autre chose aussi,
et je prie Dieu pour savoir ce que c'est.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Je vais bien.
Alors, quoi ? Donc Collier avait prévu
de dépenser 30 millions de dollars
pour financer des troupes
de mercenaires à Sao Tome ?
Il y a eu 3 coups d'état depuis leur
indépendance en 1974. Mon opinion ?
Collier a tenté d'acheter le quatrième.
Est-ce que Gary a entendu
pourquoi Collier
était si intéressé par cette île
de la côte ouest Africaine ?
Sans ses médicaments, nous sommes
chanceux d'avoir pu en tirer autant.
Oui, mais nous savons ce que Collier pense,
il se tient prêt pour un conflit avec quelqu'un.
Le NTAC, le gouvernement, je ne sais pas.
Il compte placer un gouvernement
amical à Sao Tome.
Cela pourrait être un endroit où aller
quand les choses chaufferont.
Comme quoi,
une terre promise pour les 4400 ?
Malheureusement vous ne pouvez pas
poursuivre quelqu'un
pour des illusions de grandeur.
Ce ne sont pas des illusions
si vous pouvez les réaliser.
Nous avons toujours un train de retard
par rapport à Collier
car nous continuons à le voir
comme une sorte de
gourou.
Ce que nous devrions
nous demander, c'est si...
avant que Collier ne soit enlevé,
il avait déjà ce projet en tête et si...
il est parvenu à le réaliser ?
Ils ne l'ont pas rendu cinglé
dans cette boule de lumière.
Bien, en tout cas, nous voulions
savoir à quoi Collier pensait.
Gary l'a trouvé pour nous.
Il est temps de le ramener
à la section médicale, n'est-ce pas ?
Bientôt.
"Bientôt" ?
La NSA est prévenue, à chaque fois que nous
enregistrons un nouveau don chez un 4400.
Ils ont pensé à D. C., emprunter Garry
pour l'une de leurs opérations.
Non, plus de mission d'espionnage,
il aura juste à être assis à des conférences.
Vous savez comment c'est avec les diplomates
Ils ne disent jamais ce qu'ils pensent.
Ce n'était pas l'arrangement
que j'ai fait avec lui.
Mais les termes ont changé.
Gary est trop précieux.
Je lui ai donné ma parole.
Vous me faites passer pour un menteur.
Vous avez joué le jeu
pendant prés de 20 ans.
Mon opinion c'est que, vous avez vous aussi
commis les sept péchés capitaux,
comme nous tous ici.
J'aurais dû le laisser avec Collier.
Il l'aurait lui aussi utilisé,
mais il l'aurait aussi aidé.
Ne m'utilisez plus jamais.
Tous ce que je voulais
c'était jouer au base-ball.
Vous aviez promis de m'aider, mais
vous ne pouvez pas le faire, n'est-ce pas ?
On s'inquiète à propos des 4400,
il semble de plus en plus
qu'ils devraient s'inquiéter de nous.
Vous connaissez ce bar, Chez Mel ?
Au coin de Lancaster et de la 3éme ?
Tu te joins à moi ?
Nous n'allons pas faire les bars.
Eh bien, j'y vais cette nuit,
avec ou sans toi.

Qu'est-ce qui t'es arrivé ?
Comment tu sais que ça va m'arriver ?
Qu'est-ce que ça pourrait être ?
Je ne retournerai pas
en quarantaine
Non devons aider les gens.
C'est pourquoi nous avons été renvoyés.
- De quoi parlez-vous ?
- Que voulez-vous.
- Qu'est-ce qui ce passe ?
- Combien ?
C'est-ce que vous
voulez dire, n'est-ce pas ?
Previously on the 4400...
We're not sure what's just happened.
The light is gone, and thousands of
people have just suddenly appeared.
- We're letting them go.
- We're letting them go?
You don't have a legal
right to hold them.
You're pregnant?
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.
What's all this?
What's it look like?
That baby could be
the key to the future,
And it has to be
protected, and I can do that.
Go ahead. Run!
That baby belongs with me.
This is your new house?
It's yours too.
I've been looking forward
to this moment for too long.
Diana Skouris,
your adoption of Maia Rutledge is
hereby complete, legal, and binding.
Her visions stopped about
four months ago.
We're not sure why.
Mrs. Usher next door
is getting a kitten.
Mommy's bosses will be
punished for betraying us.
It wasn't me!
That creature made me pull the trigger!
Getting dressed from the top down now?
That the way they do it on the Mariners?
Mariners?
Gary's got his eyes on the Sox.
No, you mean the Sox
got their eyes on him.
How's it feel, all those
scouts in the stands?
You bend over to tie a
shoelace, they make a note.
How about a little respect, huh?
You're in the presence of
the new Jackie Robinson.
First 4400 to make the big leagues.
Don't worry about the scouts, man.
I'll float you some
right down the middle.
You just get into your rhythm, forget
they're even out there, all right?
Can't blame him.
Six scouts.
I'd be afraid I was going to choke.
I'm not gonna choke.
Barnes can't serve them
any better than that.
Just... just give me a second.
He's throwing him a beach ball.
He's scared, man.
What was wrong with that?
What a loser.
Follow through. Follow through.
This time try taking the
bat off your shoulder.
Why don't you try kissing my ass?
What's your problem, Gary?
Navarro!
Get your head in the game. Focus.
I want to see some contact.
The majors?
Kid doesn't look like
he's ready for rookie ball.
Just shut up!
Will all of you just shut the
hell up and let me concentrate?
Whoa, Gary...
Take it down a notch.
Yeah, you're a flake, aren't you?
Go ahead. Take a swing at me.
I'll plant you where you stand.
I am not going to hit you!
Who said anything about hitting, man?
That's it, Navarro.
You're done for the day.
I want to see you in my
office after practice.
There's nothing wrong with me.
There is nothing wrong with me.
- Keep walking, mister.
- There is nothing wrong with me!
Keep walking, mister. Now.
Gary, man, take it easy.
Don't touch me!
This kid isn't ready, man.
This was a big waste of time.
Ready for the bigs, my ass.
What was wrong with that?
You shut up.
Shut up!
You shut up!
Shut up!
There's nothing wrong with me!
Well, it beats that ditch in the woods.
Not by much.
It's just a day or two.
Let Isabelle get rested up,
then we'll push on the rest of the way.
We got enough to make it to White Bird?
New car...
Trip to the emergency room...
It's going to be close.
All this running and hiding,
sometimes I forget we
haven't done anything wrong.
Three dead men in the
woods might disagree.
Do you want to shower first, or should I?
You go ahead.
Give Isabelle her bottle, okay?
That was you, wasn't it?
Who stopped those men in the woods?
Daddy sure would like to know.
But you're not going to tell me, are you?
What's funny?
Marmaduke.
Can we get a dog?
Oh, smooth, how you slid that in there.
No.
Skouris.
April.
No, no, no, no.
I'm glad to hear from
you. You're my sister.
It's just... it's been
a while, that's all.
No, we're here, just having breakfast.
Hang on a sec.
- Mrs. Lennox must've forgotten her key.
- I'll get it.
No, no. No, I'll get it.
You just keep eating.
I just have to let Maia's teacher in.
Coming!
One more sec.
Surprised?
April...
How's it going, sibling?
Good.
You look good.
Yeah, you too.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
The "Pacific Northwest Body Art Expo".
I have a booth.
Don't tell me you haven't
gotten your tickets yet.
Uh, no.
Hello.
Oh, my god.
You must be Maia.
April Skouris, black sheep of the family.
Di, you are so lucky.
Look at this fabulous kid you got.
And no labor, no stretch
marks, no diapers...
No crappy husband.
Oh, wait, that was me.
How come I never met you before?
- It's complicated.
- We've been busy.
Okay, we'll stick with "busy".
Whatever.
I'm here now.
So where are you staying
while you're in town?
This couch looks comfortable.
It's not an execution, Shawn.
Last time I was on stage was
my fourth-grade spelling bee.
These people are interested in us.
They want to hear what we have to say.
You'll think of something.
Hello.
My name is Shawn Farrell,
and I am one of the 4400.
Uh, a few months ago,
I never thought anyone would
ever clap when I said that.
But we didn't know
then what we know now...
The future of mankind is in jeopardy,
and right here, with your help,
is where we start to
set things straight.
If you join us here...
- Mr. Collier, Mr. Dravitt's here for you.
- Thank you.
... the best version of yourselves.
Ian.
Thanks for fitting me in.
Interesting place you got here.
I'm not going to be
abducted by aliens, am I?
No, Ian. They weren't aliens.
They were from the future...
I know. So you've told me, ad nauseum.
Look, it's all the same sideshow to me.
So, here I am.
Here you are.
What say we get down to business?
Ian Dravitt.
Founder and CEO of
"Executive Projections",
a multinational corporation
based in Zimbabwe.
Your company wants to do
business in a third world country,
they'll show you the lay of the land.
It's all perfectly legitimate...
Yeah, on the surface,
but Dravitt's real money comes from
mercenary activity and arms dealing.
Sold grenade launchers to the I.R.A.,
white phosphorus landmines to the
"Shining Path" guerrillas in Peru...
- So what's he selling to Collier?
- Good question...
But our observation teams can't even
tell you what time Collier takes lunch.
Beyond the lobby, that
place is a mystery.
I mean, we've sent our agents in
disguised as air conditioning guys,
fiber optics repairmen...
Yeah, we get a bug in, it's
yanked before the day is over.
Probably sweeping the
place every few hours.
As far as Collier's
pow-wows with Dravitt...
All we can do is guess.
You think he's stockpiling weapons?
Oh, arms, anthrax...
Nothing would surprise me.
I mean, Collier's all but said he's
at war with the U.S. government.
Could be laying down a defense
perimeter around the center.
That way, if we ever have to
go in there, he'll be ready.
Think Waco.
Jonestown.
Jarvis.
I'll send them down.
Mr. Navarro?
I'm Agent Skouris. This is Agent...
Please... please, don't talk.
It's too noisy.
Your voices and your thoughts, they
just all bleed together.
The E.R. report said you
were going on about...
No voices.
Just concentrate on
what you want to ask me,
and I'll hear you.
A couple of weeks ago.
It was during a game.
I could hear everyone's thoughts.
At first, it was just the pitcher, which
was pretty good, actually...
Because I knew everything he was
going to throw before he threw it.
Went five for five.
Two homers, two singles, and a double.
That is exactly what...
Yeah, it was great when it started,
but I can't control it.
First, it was everyone on the team,
and then everyone in the stands,
and then, I don't know, it was just...
... just everyone.
It's like this ocean of noise
crashing around in my head.
I want someone to make it go away.
That's what I want.
I was this close...
To making it to the
majors when I got snatched.
This time, I'm gonna make it.
I have to make it.
What, so Navarro is really
some kind of mind reader?
I believe "telepath" is
the word you're looking for.
Well, call it something else if
the word makes you uncomfortable,
but the guy definitely
knew what we were thinking.
Interesting gift.
I could think of a few
practical applications for it.
Dr. Ostman gave him some Haloperidol.
It calmed him down, quieted
the noise some.
So he can function as long
as he's on antipsychotic meds?
We don't have to fit
him for any straitjacket,
but he's not going to be
hitting any knuckleballs either...
... which is all he wants to do.
Yeah, I'll put NTAC medical on it.
If they can help him, they will.
Great.
Kyle Baldwin.
Social security number?
There it is.
Baldwin...
Nope.
You're not eligible to register.
Sure I am. I got in last semester.
I just took deferred admission.
Except your tuition hasn't been paid.
What are you talking about?
My dad sent a check.
Nope.
Baldwin.
Glad I caught you.
I've got Navarro's
transfer forms right here.
You sign them, he's on
his way to NTAC medical.
- Yeah, I will, but not just yet.
- Why not?
Well, we want to know what
Collier and Ian Dravitt are up to.
A 4400 who can read minds just
walked through the front door.
You want to use Navarro as a mole?
Is that even legal?
Mm-hmm.
D.C cleared it.
Well, how about ethical?
Guy's asking us for help.
Hell, he's even begging us.
And we'll help him.
But he's got to help us first.
What if he says no?
Then you'll get him to say yes.
Excuse me.
Can we get one more blanket?
The one we have is kind of thin.
Yeah, well, they're all kind of thin,
but if you want to bring
it down, I'll switch you.
Oh, I think we might need both.
You might think you need them,
but you aren't going to get them.
See, there's only so many
rooms and so many blankets.
And you have your allotment.
My baby is cold.
Can I please have one more
blanket so she doesn't get sick?
I'll give you five dollars.
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.
He wasn't very nice to us, was he?
Here.
Thank you...
What if they catch me?
We'll be monitoring you
every step of the way.
We plant a tiny transmitter/receiver
behind your ear under the skin.
Takes 10 minutes, no scar.
If things go south we'll
be in there like the cavalry.
When I was a kid, my, uh...
... my favorite show was
"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.".
30 years, just gone in a snap.
My little brother is retiring...
... from the Tacoma police
force at the end of the year.
He's 53.
The guys I played ball with?
The ones that made it
to the majors are...
... signing autographs at card shows now.
The game is all I have.
Yeah, I get that.
What, did you play ball?
Senior year in college.
I blew my knee out trying
to slide under a tag.
What position?
Third base.
Another infielder, huh?
You miss it?
All the time.
But what we do here, Gary...
... what we're asking you to do for us...
... it's not the world series...
... but it's pretty damn important.
I do this for you guys...
You're gonna fix me, right?
You have my word.
Okay.
Sorry about dinner.
New case.
Well, I'm glad you didn't wait for me.
That's what you're sorry about?
Dinner?
Ask me how my first day of college was...
How was your first day of college?
I didn't have one.
Nobody paid my tuition!
What are you talking about?
Of course I did, that's ridiculous!
I tried calling you a bunch of times...
... you didn't answer your phone.
I was in meetings all day...
I know I wrote that check.
That's great, dad.
I'm sorry, Kyle, I must have forgot...
We've been talking about this for months,
how could you forget?
Here. Bring it in tomorrow.
I'll send a note.
Or I'll talk to the registrar myself.
Whatever you want.
Here...
Kyle! Don't walk away from me...
Just... look...
... I admit it.
I'm not denying it, I screwed up...
But work's been a little crazy...
Oh, the job?
I've been waiting for that one.
Finally feels like old times around here.
What's this?
Lily?
What is it?
Did you spend all the
cash buying this stuff?
Then what? Talk to me.
The cash register at the front desk...
... itas open...
... and we needed food...
... and Isabelle needed diapers...
You stole money?
It's not like I planned it.
I mean, I had to beg for a blanket,
and the drawer was open, so...
He left you standing there
with the cash register open?
No, no, he closed it.
At least I thought
he did I don't know...
It wasn't open, and then...
... and then it was open.
That still doesn't make it right.
That's not how I live my life.
Have you looked around?
'Cause this isn't how
I planned to live my life either.
Look, I know it was wrong.
I don't need you to tell me it was wrong.
Stop shaking your head.
Just eat something, okay?
It's silly for all
this food to go to waste.
Go ahead.
I'm not hungry.
How much fun was that?
I liked it. Thank you.
So where have you two been?
Your note just said "out".
Lots of places... the pier, Pike Street...
... and even the ferry.
What have you done to...
You didn't!
I told you she'd freak!
Relax, they're rub-ons.
As in "fake".
But they're pretty, aren't they?
Oh, yeah, they're very pretty
Now why don't you go get
started on your homework?
I'm in trouble
Do you at least like the shirt?
And by the way...
You live in Seattle...
... and your kid's never
heard of Kurt Cobain?
What's wrong with you, Di?
Thank goodness you're here to teach her
all about tattoos and
suicidal rock stars.
And by the way...
... who gave you permission
to take her out of school?
I'm her aunt,
I didn't know I needed permission.
Well, if you're going to send her teacher
home for the day. You do.
Sitting at your kitchen
table all day long?
Yeah, that's a big loss.
What are you keeping
this kid locked away for?
If I wanted your opinion on
how I'm raising my daughter...
... I'd ask.
Mommy?
What's wrong, sweetheart?
I think I have to throw up.
What did you give her to eat?
Anything she wanted...
Oh. Good going, aunt April...
Okay, guys, I'm going in.
Collier's going to want to meet you,
You're one of the 4400.
Anything you can learn
about him is great,
but our main target is Ian Dravitt.
See what you can find out about him...
... and why he's there.
You have a two-week
supply of Haloperidol.
It should keep your mind clear...
... but hopefully you'll be
done in a couple of days.
Excuse me.
Cute. Nice shoes.
Steer him over to the brochures.
Welcome to the center.
My name's Devon.
I'm Gary Navarro.
I'm kind of interested in
finding out what you guys do here.
Well, I'd be happy to show you around.
Have you read Mr. Collier's book?
I didn't have to, I lived it.
I'm one of the 4400.
Oh.
Well, welcome home.
Gary Navarro.
Jordan Collier.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
Well, that's a nice firm grip.
I'd expect nothing less of
a promising second baseman.
How did you know I played ball?
Well, it's my business to
know everything about the 4400.
So, uh... has anything shown up yet?
An ability, or...
No, not me.
I, uh, have a hard enough time
hitting a split-finger fastball.
It's kind of disappointing, isn't it?
All those years lost?
No abilities.
Pass him off to Devon.
Get back to Dravitt.
Jordan, we need to talk.
Absolutely, Shawn.
First, I'd like you to
meet a fellow returnee...
Gary Navarro. Shawn Farrell.
- Hi.
- How're you doing?
Shawn here's a little
luckier than you and I.
He came back with quite
a remarkable ability.
Yeah, I'm blessed, all right
see the halo around my head?
I really need to talk to you.
Give us a second...
I've been doing some poking
around on the internet.
I found out some stuff
that you need to know
because, let me tell you,
I really hope that
you don't know already.
If it can be found on a search engine,
believe me, I know it.
You're okay with this Dravitt guy?
Eyes on the prize, remember?
Doing business with our friend
does not make us our friend.
Dravitt's not my friend.
He's a dangerous prick.
I'll meet you outside in 10 minutes.
As soon as I get Gary squared away here.
We'll talk about it.
Here you go.
Hello?
Hello?
Are you all right?
Whoa. Where was I?
Far away, I think.
First day meltdown?
Just lost and late.
And begging my way into classes
I don't even want to take.
Not such a good day, then.
"Introductory survey of
19th-century novellas".
Kill me now!
Maybe it'll enlighten you in
ways you never could have imagined.
Not likely...
It was the only thing open this period.
Well, this is Olin Hall...
Take the stairs inside to your left
Thanks.
Maybe I'll see you around.
You never know.
Hello, everybody.
I'm Wendy Paulson.
Welcome to "Intro to
19th-century novellas".
Is everyone in the right place?
I will speak to you after class.
I can't hear anything.
I'm going to try to get closer.
Gary, what are you doing?
Collier and that kid...
... your nephew...
... I think they're arguing
about that guy Dravitt.
Where are you?
Gary, go inside...
Getting a good eyeful?
I'm just...
Should we pull him out?
No, no, no...
Not yet. Not yet.
Maybe he can talk his way out of it.
Now what the hell do
you think you're doing?
Let him go.
You should be careful who
you let in your manor, my son.
We detained him as a
professional courtesy.
Jordan, these guys are thugs.
No need for name-calling.
We merely happened upon this gentleman...
... in the process of
spying on the two of you.
I had a couple of
questions for you that's all...
I mean, I saw you guys were
having an argument or something,
what am I supposed to do, interrupt?
Want to know what we were talking about?
Because it's no big secret.
I'll tell you exactly what
we were talking...
You're going to find I'm
tied up a lot of the time.
Gary, if you have questions,
any of my staff... will be happy to help.
Yeah, sorry next time I'll know better.
All right.
Go on back inside.
Careful where he wanders.
No one's getting between
me and $30 million.
Richard?
What is it? What's wrong?
The police...
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.
I'll tell them I took the money.
You didn't have anything to do with it.
Police, open up!
Give us a minute!
Open up. Now!
They're not after us.
We're okay.
Guys? You there?
Go ahead, Gary.
Yeah, sorry I've been so out of touch.
They had me in these classes all morning.
I haven't even seen Collier all day...
... or that other guy.
Well, that's okay.
You just go where they tell you.
Yeah, but I thought you
said you wanted to know more
about that money that
Collier's shelling out?
Where are my meds?
Gary, what's wrong?
My meds, they're gone. I don't...
Uh, excuse me?
I, uh, I had a prescription...
... some tranquilizers in my room...
... and now they're gone.
You don't need those.
You've been conditioned
to think you need them.
Taking anything that
suppresses your natural openness
is counterintuitive to our program.
Maybe you should sit through
the nutrition and
purification lecture again.
Did you hear that, Baldwin?
They took the Haloperidol!
Yes, Gary, I heard it.
You want to abort? You
want to walk out of there?
- Everything is just
- Just...
... getting louder in my head already.
It's already getting worse.
Voices are starting to
bleed through the walls.
Just calm down, Gary.
We'll come and get you if we need to.
It's your call.
Gary, talk to me.
Okay. Um...
Y- y-you guys are
going to hold up...
... your end of this deal, right?
Yes. Of course.
Okay, okay.
I'll, uh, I'll hold up my end,
and I'll hang in as long as I can.
Good. We'll hang in with you.
Now, listen, Gary,
someone's going to be on
this channel 24/7, remember?
Yeah, right.
Right.
I read "The Secret Sharer" last night.
Just like your syllabus
said. That's a good start.
Well, not just the first 20 pages.
I got really into it,
I read the whole thing.
19th-century novellas not quite
the hell on earth you expected?
It definitely wasn't boring.
I've got a lot of questions, though.
Okay, well, I have office
hours wednesdays, one to four.
Okay, yeah, I'll try to stop by.
Or we could run by the
coop and grab some coffee?
Like, right now?
I like talking about Joseph Conrad.
It's why I picked this for a living.
Where did you learn to do all this?
Mom never taught us to cook.
I don't know I just learned how.
Had to be better than you at something.
Aunt April, do you have any kids?
Nope.
No kids.
Are you married?
I used to be.
Ask your mom what she
thought of my ex-husband.
Don't start.
You didn't like him?
Neither did April, apparently.
She only stayed with Trevor
for what, seven months?
You were hostile from day one.
You never gave him a chance.
I didn't really think he
deserved much of a chance.
He was... kind of a moron.
He was 22.
Show me one guy who isn't a moron at 22.
He knew you hated him,
and that didn't make it any easier
for us to stay together.
Come on you can't keep
blaming that on me.
I mean, just grow up.
Okay, this was a mistake.
I thought it was a
good idea to come here,
but obviously I was wrong.
I'll go pack.
There's a little hotel up the street.
No!
It's okay, honey. We'll still see...
But the power's going
to go out there tonight,
and you won't have any lights.
What is she talking about?
Can I please be excused?
Mr. Navarro, is something wrong?
This is no good.
I need my Haloperidol.
Where's Collier?
Mr. Collier's in a meeting.
Mr. Navarro?
Mr. Navarro...
Gary, what's wrong?
I just got to talk to Collier.
That's not a good idea, Gary.
Mr. Navarro...
He's in a meeting!
Make it stop.
Please, make it stop!
Make it stop...
I need my medication.
Whatever's eating you, old son,
we'll make it stop.
Count on that.
A 4400 who can read minds?
So you do have an ability.
You shouldn't have lied to me, Gary.
You mean to tell me
That this guy knows what I'm thinking?
Because I do not like
anyone inside my head but me.
Jordan, this guy's one of us.
We can't just stand here
and let him get killed.
Nobody's killing anyone.
First we determine
what our man here knows...
... and then we discuss his fate.
Because there are things
I know that could get you killed!
That could get all of you killed.
Call Jarvis. Tell her we're going in.
Look, Ian...
Shut up!
Shut up now!
Hi. I'm Evan.
Welcome to the 4400 center.
Second level's not open to visitors.
We're not visitors.
Hey, look, buddy, I've got a badge too,
and this is private property.
What the hell's he doing to him?
Let him go,
or god help me,
I'll splatter your brains
all over your highly polished floor.
Now, that is enough.
Drop that weapon! Now!
How the hell did you get in here?
You don't sound so happy to see us.
Well, now. What in the hell is this?
NTAC agents.
I don't appreciate the government
interfering in my business.
You should be more careful
who you do business with.
They're not buying weapons.
They're planning a coup
overseas, some tiny country.
You sent a spy in here, uncle Tommy?
Good job, you almost got
us all killed.
You too, Mr. Dravitt.
Well, it'll be interesting to see
If your friend's impressions
will stand up in court.
I guess I'm the one
should be more careful
Who I do business with.
Shawn, you can come with us if you want.
Great.
I'll tell your mother you said hello.
Gary, you should have come to me first.
I'd have treated you
better than they ever will.
We're at war here.
Don't pick the losing side.
Look at the cute little baby.
I think somebody wants
to try your toy, Walt.
I think you're right.
Hi.
Put her back in the car?
Why?
Now, please.
What's your problem?
That little boy was
being sweet with her.
I just didn't want anybody getting hurt.
Hurt? Who's going to get hurt?
What if she doesn't want
to give the toy back?
What's going to happen then?
Don't look at me
like you don't know
what I'm talking about.
Those three men in the woods...
... they wanted us dead.
You saw what happened to them.
That was Isabelle.
We both know it, and there's no use in
pretending otherwise.
Whatever Isabelle does, she
does it out of love for us.
She's our daughter, Richard.
I know she is.
I love her right back, but
she's something else too,
and I wish to god I knew what that was.
What is it?
What's wrong?
I'm fine.
So, what?
So Collier planned to spend $30 million
funding mercenary activity in Sao Tome?
They've had three coups since
their independence in '75.
My guess?
Collier was trying to buy number four.
Did Gary happen to hear why Collier's
so interested in an island
off the west coast of Africa?
Without his medication,
we're lucky to have got
that much out of him.
Yeah, but we do know
that Collier thinks he's headed
towards a conflict with someone...
... NTAC, the entire government, I don't know.
He installs a friendly
government in Sao Tome,
it could have been a place
to go when things heat up.
What, like a homeland for the 4400?
Too bad you can't prosecute a
man for delusions of grandeur.
They're not delusions
if you can make them come true.
We're always one step behind Collier
because we keep seeing him
as some kind of cult nut.
What we should be asking ourselves is,
before Collier was abducted,
did he ever set his mind to something and...
... not get it done?
They didn't make him any
dumber in that ball of light.
Well, anyway, we wanted to know
what Collier was thinking.
Gary found out for us.
Time to turn him over
to NTAC medical, right?
Soon.
"Soon"?
The NSA is CC'd
any time we register a new 4400 ability.
They have been leaning on DC
to borrow Gary for an
op they've got planned.
No... no more
cloak-and-dagger stuff.
He'll sit in on a few conferences.
You know how it is with diplomats.
They don't always say what they think.
That wasn't the
agreement I made with him.
But terms have changed.
Gary's too valuable.
I gave him my word.
You're turning me into a liar.
You've been in the game almost 20 years.
My guess is, you've committed all
the seven deadly sins,
just like the rest of us.
I should have let him stay with Collier.
He might have used him, but
he would've helped him too.
Don't you ever use me again.
All I wanted was to play ball.
You guys promised to help,
but you can't do that, can you?
We're worried about the 4400.
It seems more and more like
they should be worried about us.
You know that bar, Mel's?
Corner of Lancaster and Third?
You feel like joining me?
We don't go to bars.
Well, I'm going tonight, with
you or without you.
We're not sure what's just happened.
The light is gone,
and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared.
Tom is the best agent I've ever worked with,
maybe the best you've got in this division.
I thought I was being re-assigned to field duty.
You are, effective immediately.
Work's been a little crazy lately...
Oh, the job?
I've been waiting for that one.
It finally feels like old times around here.
April, glad to hear from you. You're my sister.
Surprised?
How come I've never met you before?
- It's complicated.
- We've been busy.
I'm Shawn Farrell.
I am one of the 4400.
Can I sign you up for a tour?
I was looking for my cousin, Shawn Farrell.
Policy prohibits me from discussing our membership.
I've been to that place where you're living.
There's some serious Stepford Wives vibes going on there.
You know that, right?
These centers, they're a chance to bring people together.
Sounds like someone got inside your head.
I will not allow these shadows from your past
alter your perceptions.
The goal is what matters.
Ensure the future.
Save the planet.
If Maia's having visions, you should know about it
and you should know what they are.
Isabelle is six months old.
I don't know why she talks to me and not to you.
- Talks?
- NTAC? Collier?
I don't know who it is,
but someone knows we're 4400s.
Start packing.
How'd it go today, daddy?
That bad, huh?
Nobody wants to buy time shares in Wilmington, Idaho.
Baja, California maybe.
If I were you, I'd go in there
and tell them "either let me have the good listings,
or I quit".
The whole staff wants Baja, honey
and I don't have the seniority.
How is that fair?
You've been a salesman longer than any of them.
Salesman, not telemarketer.
It's different.
Hey, hey. Appelbaum.
Payday.
Leave him alone!
He's trying to pay you back!
This your beer, Appelbaum?
You don't mind if I quench my thirst, do you?
Honey, stay back.
Stay back.
I just need a couple more weeks.
Something will turn around.
You know, in my business
you hear every sob story in the book
but I got to tell you, yours is a new one.
"disappeared 15 years ago, came
back in a ball of light, wife died
daughter dropped out of school".
You got a bad break,
but you borrowed the money,
and now you're going to have to pay me back.
I'll figure something out.
Oh, you do it quickly,
because you and I are going to talk again in 48 hours.
I thought you 4400s got special powers.
How come you're such a big nothing?
Just lucky, I guess.
All right, let's go.
Thanks for the beer.
We should be at Eric's place tomorrow.
Be nice to see a friendly face,
maybe sleep in for a change.
Sounds good.
You like Eric, right?
You guys got along in quarantine.
Richard, I'm late.
Like, "I might be pregnant" late.
You sure?
No, I'm not sure.
I'm late.
Well, we just have to wait and see.
Wait and see?
We could go to the drugstore, maybe...
get one of those test things.
And what would you want it to say?
I'd like it to say, "Congratulations.
You have a job, a house, and a future.
You're ready for another child".
But I don't think it's going to say that.
No.
Probably not.
$3,150... 32, 33...
$3,400.
Well, that should keep
that creep happy for a while.
I'm sorry about your car.
I'll ride the bus to work.
Sorry about the television.
I'll read a book.
Appelbaum, the miracle man, huh?
You notice anything different about me?
My god...
75 pounds in two days.
Now, at first, I thought the termites had gotten me.
You know, I was sick
cancer. Doctors ran all the
tests. Turns out I'm fine. But
how could I lose all that weight?
Then
I thought of you.
Me and you, we shared a bottle of beer,
and you're one of those 4400s.
What does that prove?
Nothing yet. But let's-- let's
find out. I want you to take a sip.
Because if I'm right,
you made me lose all this weight,
and then the same thing
should happen to my wife, who...
though I love very much,
I do-
could stand to lose maybe 20 pounds.
30.
Go ahead.
Drink up.
Applebaum...
these people who took you,
they set you up for life.
They snatched up a bum salesman,
and they sent you back...
... "the human diet".
"The human diet".
I like that.
Go ahead.
Chloe! Want you next the door.
When is your next CD promo?
Thank you. Thank you.
Reading Jordan's book was an absolute revelation.
I bought copies for all my back up dancers
and we discuss it every night after the show.
She cut her tour short.
Yes, because I felt like I had to be here.
Obviously, I'm not one of 4400.
But I expect to be treated
just like any other student here.
If I'm lucky enough
to tap into an ability,
I will use it to ensure the world
a brighter future.
Congratulations, Chloe Grenzer, you have achieved...
... "first key".
Thank you.
Last year, she was into Compila.
It's amazing, I lost 23 pounds.
I haven't weighed less than 130 since college.
Told you Applebaum was a real deal, right?
You have been happy harrassing him anymore.
Honey, what we got from him is way more
than he owns me, right?
Turn around.
Question of the day...
Who is Trent Applebaum and why
is Drandix corporation calling me about him.
Applebaum disappeared in the late 80's.
He's in phone-sells, right?
And now he's selling himself.
He claimed that his saliva
is a catalyst for weight loss.
Applebaum backed his claim up?
Two good satisfied customers...
Married couple,
one drop 75 pounds, the other 23,
practically over a night.
My god.
They got a hand of the future on this one.
If they really gave him this ability,
it could be the cure for obesity.
Yeah, it will change the world.
That's about to change Trent Applebaum's world.
He hired a lawyer, an agent,
they were asking 20 million dollars
but Trent's in a bidding war with three other company so...
who knows what the final number will end up.
A 4400, selling exclusive rights to his ability, is it legal?
Our lawyer is looking into an injunction,
but at the moment,
no legislation specifically prevents it.
Then our guy stands to be a very rich man.
Maybe we should go see him.
Yeah, find out if he's really worth 20 million dollars.
Hey hey! Jet pilot!
...
...
- Did I get it right?
- Close enough.
So... you sounded a little freaked out on the phone.
Anything I should know about?
Better that you don't.
Hey!
Look at you two,
love birds from quarantine, building B.
This little cutie must be Isabelle.
Your daddy told me all about you.
I bet he did.
Look, come on in.
I'll show you guys the guest room,
or maybe somebody sleep on the couch.
A minus.
Not too shabby from my first college assignment.
It was a good paper, well fall out.
So what's the minus for?
Well, I always like to leave
a bit of room for improvement.
"Last Days of Pompeii".
Yeah, they throw that party every year.
You should go, go out
some steam you've earned it.
I hate to go alone, you're up for it?
I probably flaunted to have
rememberance of that threat.
Not my scene, but...
don't let me stop you.
I don't know how it works,
they put something inside me.
One of those enzyme or whatever.
So someone drinks from the same bottle
as you do and they lose weight.
Maybe we should give him a demonstration.
Cut it out, Elise.
She thinks she needs to lose eight pounds.
- Try ten.
- Sweetie, you're beautiful...
... you don't need to lose anything.
He's right about that, you don't.
A lot of kids go to college when they're eighteen.
Elise had to take a job at a diner.
We were apart for sixteen years,
but while I was gone,
they gave me a way to make it up to her.
Mr. Applebaum, no one's telling you
not to provide for your daughter,
but a 4400 putting his gift
on the open market is a first.
We wanna make sure nobody gets taking advantage of that.
Not you, not the buyer, other 4400...
You don't have to teach me about selling.
I've been a salesman my whole life.
Most of the stuff I paddled?
Junk.
But now I've got a product that everybody wants
and only I can provide, I am the damn product.
Nobody is putting Trent Appelbaum
back in the bottle.
My father fought in Korea, infantry.
I flew in F-36.
Eric told me.
Daddy admired you guys.
He said there were only 25 black pilots
in the whole Air Force
who were allowed to fly like everybody else.
There weren't a lot of us, it's true.
The first person I met along time
he couldn't mention the Korean War.
That was a big deal in our house,
Veterans Day, I'd be off from school, we always go to pray.
Yeah, my grandfather and my mom said
he'd take me too.
except it was called "Armistice Day" back date.
For world war one,
he put on those boot, dress,
go watch with his buddy.
Daddy looks so handsome in his uniform.
I bet you did too.
I'd like to meet him sometime.
Yeah, well, too late.
He passed away, two years ago this August.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thank you.
He would really love to have met you too.
The guy was 81,
he was born four years after I was.
Well, lucky for you, I like older man.
So Richard, we've known
what were you up to in 1951...
... how about lately?
Well, I've been working as a auto mechanic...
Oh, really?
So what brings you to this part of the country?
It's kind of remote for vacation.
They came to see me,
as 4400s, we gotta stick together.
We have a bond that you mere humans
will never understand.
Eric, you freak me out
when you talk that 4400 unity crap.
Not much of a talker, are you, Lily?
I'm not really used to be in
social situation these days.
You are a lucky man.
With this one here,
it's "iap iap iap",
but I guess you already noticed that, didn't you?
I have to pee,
for about 75th time today.
I have to change Isabelle.
That thing is beautiful.
Other all are beautiful.
I just like them better in this book
than I do on somebody's shoulder.
You don't get it, Dia.
These drawings are not meant live on the page,
they're meant to live on the skin.
That's very deep,
but you're right, I don't get it.
I do.
Ok, you got to let this brilliant little girl
go with me tomorrow.
It's a tattoo shop.
A body art emporium.
And for five hours tomorrow,
I'm the featured artist.
You must be pretty good.
Can we go?
Just for a little while?
One hour.
Shawn, have you seen Chloe's schedule?
Why would I see Chloe's schedule, Devon?
She has an interview with media
three o'clock tomorrow?
Oh, hopefully, she will mention the center.
But her nutrition and purification class
is at three o'clock.
Yeah, I think I heard Jordan say
she was excused from that.
She's been on the macrobiotic diet
for three years.
Or so she says.
Look,
I'm sure Jordan plans on treating Chloe
like any other student.
Ok?
No, I'm ready to close.
I don't wanna wait,
just tell him it's done
and I'll be in tomorrow.
Alright,
thanks, Celine.
How much?
40 million dollars.
Where is the next round? Come on.
It's on its way.
But sir, this will be your fourth steak.
- We're hungry.
- Ok,
just hate to see make yourself sick.
No one is sick, we're hungry,
and starving, now go go.
Get your hands up, please, go.
I'm starving.
Morning-- you're not dressed?
Those guys from Arkham Films
are here to pitch us.
Oh, the recruitment video.
Yeah, well, you can handle that meeting,
can't you?
Well, yeah, sure,
if you're too busy, yeah.
Hey.
Guess Jordan's getting a late start this morning.
My bad.
I'm going to just jump in the shower, okay?
Shower sounds good, Chloe.
Close your mouth, Shawn.
You'll draw flies.
One-on-one tutoring with a first key?
That's...
... that's new.
First key or not,
Chloe demands-- deserves
a different level of attention.
She's our entree, Shawn,
into the entertainment community.
Jordan, you have an entire chapter in your book
that rips celebrity culture.
It's a cancer that separates people,
that helps define the haves and have-nots.
And 4400 culture is all about unity, yes.
Please, Shawn...
... do not quote me back to myself.
The fact is, celebrities have deep pockets
and deeper insecurities,
and we can use both to our advantage.
You can be a manipulative prick.
You know that?
Yeah.
Well.
It helps to use your entire skill set
when you're trying to change the world.
You and Lily should think about putting down
some roots here.
I think all this running is fraying you both
around the edges.
You noticed.
Hard not to.
You can do a lot worse than White Bird.
It's quiet.
Everyone minds their own business.
Eventually you're going to have to stop
criss-crossing the highways.
Might as well do it here,
before you run out of road.
Thank you, by the way.
For not asking what we're running from.
I figured if you wanted me to know, you'd tell me.
Look, Richard.
I got all the work I can handle up in Livingston,
keeping up these movie stars' second homes.
I could use a hand.
You offering me a job?
They used to call us handymen.
Now we're property managers.
Either way, you'd be working with me,
not for me.
And if you'll just sign right here..
as agreed--
your signing bonus.
When do I start?
You're making breakfast.
As you pour the milk over your cereal,
you notice that there's a photo
of a missing child on the side of the carton.
It takes you a moment to realize
that it's a picture of you
at 10 years old.
This one's giving me the chills.
Who's making this stuff up?
Moron.
Devon, do not let Jordan hear you say that.
The two of them hooked up last night.
Yeah, and by the looks of it, probably this morning, too.
There's a telephone number
on the missing persons report.
It's the number of your childhood home.
Stay here?
You mean permanently?
It's a nice town,
and Eric says I can start work tomorrow.
Look, Lily.
We've got to get you off the road,
especially if you're pregnant again.
I'm not.
You sure?
Positive.
Please don't try to pretend you're not relieved.
Relieved?
Lily, I was trying to wrap my head around it,
that's all.
Especially if we're not going
to be running anymore.
I don't know about this place, Richard.
- Isabelle thinks...
- Oh,
let me guess.
We should move on.
I was hoping we could go to Salem, Oregon.
I have some relatives there.
I think they might be willing to help us out
and keep quiet about it.
Salem?
That's a city.
Maybe we could get lost in a crowd for a change.
This place
this life, it feels right to me.
This is Eric's life.
It's not yours.
It's not ours.
No, this is not a negotiating stance.
It's my answer-- no.
Goodbye.
So let me guess-- the answer is no?
That was a rep from the Yoyotron corp.
They want to sign Maia to a $300,000-a-year holding contract.
But Maia doesn't have any ability anymore.
Well, you don't need any
to make any of these deals.
They're signing 4400s up on spec.
They want them in their pocket in case something develops down the line.
Well, you did the right thing
by saying no.
Tom.
About Maia.
What? She's okay, isn't she?
She's fine.
I've been trying to figure out
the right time to tell you this.
I probably should have done it right away, but...
you know, those visions that Maia used to have?
It turns out she was only pretending
that they stopped.
How long have you known?
Not long.
I only found out because I read her diary,
but it was an eyeful.
You going to tell Jarvis?
I'd rather not.
Turn my daughter's diary over to the government.
Hey, don't give me that look, Tom.
You kept Shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.
Guess we're even now.
See how cool that looks?
Your aunt, she's a real artist.
Oh, say it again, Billy boy.
I don't think my sister heard you.
Oh, I heard him.
You're a star.
Believe it.
As soon as I heard April was appearing here,
I booked my time right away.
So did pretty much all of my buddies.
That's impressive.
I'm proud of you.
Wait a minute.
You didn't actually just say
that you were proud of me?
Cut it out. Of course I am.
I always thought you thought I was a loser.
Did you really think that?
Yeah, I really did.
April.
All I said was that I liked the tattoo.
You don't always wear your helmet, do you?
You should wear one tonight.
Why's that?
You won't make it over to
Monica's house if you don't.
Does that hurt?
How do you know about my girlfriend?
I really think you should wear your helmet.
- You killed her.
- Dimitri?
What happened to you?
My wife, she's gone.
Doctors say that she starved to death.
I'm next.
You killed us both.
How many times am I supposed to tell you?
I don't know how I got to that store.
and I sure as hell don't
remember breaking any window.
Not remembering is no excuse.
And stop telling me somebody spiked your drink.
The police ran tests, Kyle.
There's no GHB in your system.
What else could it be?
You spent three years in a coma.
You have no business drinking anything!
Okay. So I screwed up.
I'm sorry. What more do you want?
How about acknowledging that this was serious?
Do you know how close they were to
charging you with breaking and entering?
Which by the way, is a felony.
If I didn't play the NTAC card,
you'd be sitting in a jail cell right now.
Can I go to bed?
No. This is serious.
You want to make up for last time, Kyle.
I get it. I get it.
But we need to talk about
some ground rules for you.
I'm not a kid.
I don't need ground rules.
I wouldn't know that from tonight.
Answer it.
What?
You're kidding me.
Yeah. I'll be right in.
We'll finish this later.
What happened to laying down the law?
Oh. right. Something more important came up.
Just go upstairs, Kyle.
Just go upstairs.
Richard?
What are you doing out here?
Oh. I'm just getting some air.
Well, hop in. We'll give you a ride back.
I was reading about your airforce unit
on the internet yesterday.
No kidding.
I looked at it a couple times too.
You guys were one of the most
decorated flying squads--
Tara. Will you stop pestering the man
about his past?
It's okay.
I don't mind.
Well, as long as you're feeling talkative,
I've got a question for you.
What did a brother have to do back in the 50s
before they'd let you fly a plane, huh?
Polish the officer's boots on the weekends?
David.
No, no, no. Seriously. I mean,
I'm wondering.
Boy must've done some serious bowing and
scraping before they'd hand you them keys, right?
Okay. That is enough.
I'm so sorry, Richard.
No problem.
Some people the less they know
the more they talk.
Oh. I know some things.
I know a lot more than you realize.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means quit fawning over the man
and keep your mouth closed.
Why don't you just let me out right here?
Hey.
You sit back and relax, huh?
Now this here?
It's called marriage.
That's all.
You know what I'm talking about.
Dimitri's dead?
Organ failure resulting from
malnutrition just like his wife.
They were supposed to lose 20 or 30 pounds.
Not starve to death.
Are you sure there isn't anyone else?
Family?
Friends?
No.
Did you kiss anyone?
Share a drinking glass?
No. There's no one else.
We think we know what happened to the Kazars.
There's a protein in your saliva
that hyper-accelerated their metabolism.
It's a cagey one too.
It stimulates the brain to release epinephrine
and it breaks down fat cells at the same time.
No wonder they burned up calories faster
than their bodies could take them in.
Well, they could eat anything and everything
and still starve to death.
That doesn't make any sense.
We're supposed to be helping people, right?
That's why we were sent back.
All I wanted was to make good for my daughter.
Now I'm a murderer.
You didn't mean to do it, Trent.
That supposed to make me feel better?
We're going to have to keep you here.
Try and find a way to remove the protein
from your system.
Well, the good news is we caught it early.
A lot more people could have been infected.
Oh, no.
I was at Drandix this morning.
I spent two hours in their lab
giving tissue samples.
Look this isn't my fault.
And I have the documents to prove it.
How many people did you test?
Look, my bosses, they wanted a clinical trial up
and running by the end of the day.
- They said "Make it your top priority".
- How many?
A hundred.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. What's going on?
What's going on?
Why would Devon try to kill herself?
Obviously she's a very troubled young girl.
But she's going to be okay though?
Yeah. They were able to pump her stomach out
at the emergency room.
She's at home recovering.
Okay.
I think what we need to do right now
is continue our work.
Kyle, if the cops say you didn't get "g"ed,
you have to believe them right?
They could have screwed up the test.
I didn't drink that much.
Well maybe your dad's right.
Maybe you shouldn't drink at all.
I hope it was just the booze.
Well. What else could it have been?
When I first came out of my coma,
I wasn't quite myself.
I hope it's not happening again.
I don't know exactly what you mean,
but if you're losing chunks of time,
you should talk to your dad about it.
What's he going to do?
Turn me over to NTAC medical?
I'm not going back into quarantine.
No way.
If you're looking for Eric--
Now there's your goddamn apology.
What are you talking about?
She was at me all morning.
"Richard this". "Richard that".
"I should go apologize".
From here on in,
you stay the hell away from my wife.
You're crazy, right?
I've got nothing going on with your wife.
Now you'd better step away
and take a deep breath or something.
Man, I step where I please.
Now, listen to me.
You're going to go home,
and you're going to apologize to Tara.
And if you've got any brains at all,
you're going to start treating her better.
Because if you don't,
one day someone is going
to take her away from you.
Now get your ass out of here.
Trent. This isn't helping.
I had to see what I did.
You want to do something?
Get back to the lab.
Help them work on a way to counter this.
Just let me call Elise first, huh?
She'll be wondering where I was all night.
Help me.
Elise?
Daddy?
Help me.
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to lose 10 pounds.
Baby.
I told you you were perfect.
I used one of your water glasses.
We're going to get you help.
We're going to get everybody help.
Tom.
We've got something.
What?
Tell me.
Well. I asked the guys downstairs
if we could approach this like a smallpox vaccine,
use trace amounts of the antigen to build
resistance and counter the effects of the disease.
These people are starving to death.
Yeah, but it's because of a chemical reaction.
Now they biopsied Trent's liver.
That's where the protein is coming from.
So if we extract this protein,
they can make a serum that will
stimulate antibody production in the victims,
but they're going to have to
harvest tissue to do it.
How much of his liver would they have to use?
Given how much time we have,
they want to take all of it.
I've never seen a sunset like that.
The way it takes forever to go down,
it's like it doesn't want to give up the sky.
It's a pretty sky.
Worth holding on to.
I'm sorry.
What for?
For letting you believe even for a second
that I wouldn't want to have another child with you.
I want to build a future for us Lily,
I just need to get my feet under me first.
Well maybe if we stay here you can.
I mean it Richard.
You love it here.
I don't want to stand in the way of that.
I'd sure hate to give up that sky.
Me too.
Are you even sure this will work?
Well. It's Elise's only shot.
Her and all the others.
We've got a matching donor lined up.
It's still a big risk,
but say the word and the liver's on its way.
Okay then.
You want to close this deal?
here's the fine print--
You want Elise to go to school.
It's already done.
I talked to Drandix. They've agreed
to open up a college fund in her name.
- Sold.
- Great.
Your mom put them in a vase for me.
She's a very nice lady.
They're very pretty Shawn,
but you didn't have to.
Well I wanted to.
I hope Jordan's not too upset.
No.
No.
Hey.
He's probably too busy with his pet superstar.
Devon.
What are you doing thinking
about Jordan and Chloe right now?
Hey.
Hey.
You have no idea how I feel about him.
How deep it runs.
I worship Jordan
for everything he's giving me.
For allowing me to be so close to him.
He took me to a place I never thought possible.
Devon.
Are you telling me that you and Jordan... ?
Jordan's heart is full of love.
He shares that love with me.
It's an honor.
An honor that Chloe doesn't deserve.
She's not a real student of Jordan's.
Billy?
God. What happened to you?
At the shop the other night. I got clipped
by a car on the way out of the parking lot.
But you were wearing your helmet, weren't you?
Yeah.
Doctors said it saved my life.
How'd you know that was going to happen to me?
Children's intuition.
I'm glad you're okay.
Yeah.
Me too.
It's a shame to lose you so soon.
Sucks huh?
I thought my Atlanta dates were pushed.
Now they're threatening to sue if I don't show.
You've made such progress
in such a short period of time.
Yeah.
Believe me, that doesn't happen very often.
Well.
I sure as hell hope not.
You know me Jordan--
I like feeling special.
You are.
This was amazing.
I can't wait to get back here.
Goodbye.
Talk about a quick study.
Third key status in less than a week huh?
Noblesse oblige Shawn.
She benefits and so do we.
It's too bad all of the women that you screw
don't share the same benefits.
That's cheap and childish.
I expect more of you.
I know the feeling.
I am so sorry, you two.
- What's wrong?
- It's David.
He just looked on the website for the 4400s.
It said that you two were missing.
That you hadn't reported
in the way you were supposed to.
I heard him on the phone just now.
He's reporting you guys to the government.
Sorry about that idiot David, man.
I would have loved to have you two around.
Thanks for putting us up.
I can't.
Take it, man. Call it a down payment on
your next house, wherever that may be.
Hope you find a safe place.
I thought it was here.
Is my dad going to be all right?
Well. he's going to be in intensive care for a while.
But the transplant, it went well.
Your dad's a hero.
I'm going to tell him that when he wakes up.
If you have something to say,
now would be a good time.
You know what?
You want to hand out keys
like they're junk mail, you be my guest.
That woman will play to 20.000 people every night,
wearing our insignia, promoting our image.
Image?
How does nailing your secretary
help our image, Jordan?
I'm not perfect.
I never pretended--
I don't need perfection!
I just want you to stop giving me reason
to think of you as some kind of hypocrite.
When you're running this place, Shawn,
you can behave as nobly as you'd like.
Meaning what?
Meaning one day all of this will be yours.
The paperwork's been drawn up.
The lawyers know what to do.
Everything's in place.
But you're not going anywhere?
Nevertheless.
I sleep better,
knowing my life's work is in the hands of the...
the saintly,
the unsullied Shawn Farrell.
So we thought we had a cure
for the world's obesity problems.
Yeah. And instead, we've got two dead bodies,
a hundred other people in recovery,
and one corporation scrambling to cover its ass.
It looks like the great 4400 gold rush is over.
Making the point of this little exercise what, exactly?
Well, maybe they got it wrong.
They thought they had a cure, but they didn't.
I mean, they're from the future,
but they're still human beings, right?
Let's not rush to judgment.
We know rapid weight loss is
the effect on the human body.
But if the purpose of this protein is
to provoke metabolic chemical change,
it could have other applications.
Like...
I don't know-- breaking down toxic waste.
It could rid the ocean of pollutants.
maybe even restore in the ozone layer.
So in other words,
the possibilities are pretty much endless.
That's all they are right now though,
possibilities. I mean we're years away
from practical use.
But with his new liver, Appelbaum won't be able
to produce the chemical anymore.
He doesn't have to.
Now that we've got it isolated,
we can reproduce it
and find out what we've really got here.
So Trent earned his golden parachute after all.
Maybe his daughter can study chemistry in college.
Hey.
All right.
There won't be any interruptions on my end.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah.
Okay.
Um.
Here to say thanks,
for getting me off the hook with the cops.
Look, Kyle.
I know you're going to make mistakes.
I did when I was your age.
The only thing I ask is you
let me help you learn from them.
Makes sense.
So I just need to know,
you told me everything that
happened that night, right?
Yeah.
Previously on the 4400...
We're not sure what's just happened.
The light is gone.
And thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.
Some of them have been missing over 60 years.
None of them have any memory
of what happened to them.
I saw your brother.
Shawn?
You know those visions that Maia used to have.
It turns out she was only
pretending that they stopped.
Don't give me that look, Tom.
You kept Shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.
I've cured emphysema, leukemia...
I don't get why these attacks keep coming back.
That baby really kicked your ass.
Heidi, it's mommy.
Who?
I have another family now, and I'm sorry.
I know that's not fair to you, but...
Brian, I am still part of your life.
If you're losing chunks of time,
you should talk to your dad about it.
You told me everything that happened that night, right?
Yeah.
It's okay, it's okay.
Jordan.
You don't have to keep vigil, Shawn.
Are you going to cancel the appearance at Riverfront Park?
No, that would be a mistake.
They're not just honoring me.
They're honoring the center and all the work we've done.
- A new neurological clinic just opened in Atlanta.
- No, look, look.
I've been to all the specialists, Shawn.
There's no name for what I have.
We can't just give up.
There's got to be a way to
figure out what that baby did to you.
I know what that baby did to me.
It saved my life.
What?
What are you talking about?
When I touched Lily's pregnant
belly and was hit with that pain
I realized I'd been judged and found wanting.
- By a baby that wasn't even born yet?
- In that moment...
I was forced to see the truth about myself,
about my motives toward the 4400,
and they were... not pure.
That baby tried to kill you.
And it succeeded.
It killed the old Jordan Collier,
and I was reborn,
pure of purpose.
All I've done since,
everything I've built,
I owe to Richard,
to Lily... and to that child.
I'll get it.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Come in. Lily...
... look who's here.
We would have called,
but Heidi wanted to surprise you.
Heidi...
hi, mom.
She's so cute.
Now that you guys are living on the block,
I figured it was time for Heidi to meet her real mom.
That makes you my second dad.
I guess so.
Mom, why are you crying?
Lily, are you all right?
- Lily?
- Lily?
Lily?
Lily?
Sweetheart, wake up.
It was a dream...
more like a nightmare.
No, no.
We were living next door to Heidi and Brian,
and we were all getting along.
And the house...
Richard, it was so pretty.
So why were you crying?
I guess I knew it wasn't real.
How long can we keep going
before someone catches up to us?
We just got to keep moving,
stay ahead of Collier and NTAC.
I'm just so tired of running.
We're going to find a place to stop running.
It's out there...
... got to be.
Nice use of color.
It's shaping up, Greg,
but I think it could use some work.
That's as good as it gets.
Don't waste your time.
Ms. Tobey,
would you come with us, please?
Harmon.
Harmon...
Sam...
... what's this all about?
Ms. Tobey, I'm placing you under arrest.
Arrest?
For what?
Child abuse.
Oh, my god. What...
Look...
I know his birth certificate says the kid's 21.
But emotionally Kyle is still a teenager.
I've got to accept the fact that he's gonna screw up like a teenager.
He'll learn from his mistakes.
Get it out of his system.
But Shawn...
it's been a year.
How could he cut us out like that?
And Danny. He's eating himself up inside.
He used to be such a sweet boy.
Yeah. I remember what pop used to say...
"You think you've got problems?
Wait till you become a parent.
Little did we know.
Yeah.
What do you want to bet they're talking about us downstairs?
That's what they live for.
If they didn't have us to worry about.
They'd die of boredom.
I've seen you around campus.
I saw you too.
Why didn't you say something?
It's been, like, four years.
I mean, what was I supposed to say?
"Welcome back from coma world"?
I don't know. I guess
seeing you reminded me of Shawn.
You two were always so tight.
And you were like our shadow...
"Where you going? Can I come too?"
I thought you guys were so cool.
I was 14. What did I know?
Mom says you talked to him?
I don't think he heard me.
You know.
I used to blame Shawn for everything...
Stealing Nikki.
Running out on us the way he did.
Breaking mom's heart.
But it wasn't his fault.
And the bastards who took him sent him back a freak.
They're the ones.
Guess they screwed us all up.
Well, I want to thank councilman Lowe
on behalf of the 4400 center for this wonderful honor.
In funding this cleanup project.
I wanted to pay tribute not only to the glories of the past but to the promise of the future.
I believe that the actions we take.
The choices we make
will create the kind of future that
we and our children and their children will live in.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey!
What?
Get your hands off of me.
What do you want to do, break it?
Stop it!
Hey! What's the deal?
These people don't belong here.
No. You're the ones who don't belong here.
This used to be our home until you scumbags decided to make everything beautiful and kicked us out.
It's okay. You can let 'em go.
They were stealing food.
Well, last time I checked, the food was free.
Don't make me pull rank.
Come on.
Yes, Sir, Mr. Farrell.
Thank you.
Big shot, huh?
I'm impressed.
I'm really sorry that we trashed your home.
I am.
You should be.
It's a hell of a lot warmer here than crashing near l-90 bridge.
Food's still free, right?
Yes. Absolutely.
Please be my guest.
Yeah. We will.
Protect the future, huh?
Got to have one first.
Even on the map, Fairview seems far away.
That's four hours tops.
This is my first time spending the night away from Maia.
Isn't your sister with her?
The one with all the tattoos?
Sorry.
Those beer kegs Kyle ordered should be showing up right about now.
Yeah. You read these charges?
"Teacher is accused of reckless endangerment.
Placing her students' health,
welfare and safety at risk.
"Could that be any more vague?
Well. That could be anything from grabbing them
on the arms to touching them on the privates.
Or maybe she did nothing.
Yeah. "Nothing" would be my vote.
A 4400 serial killer was bad enough.
But a 4400 child molester?
You're damn right we don't want her back!
Not now. Not ever.
Look.
I don't know what's going to happen with Ms. Tobey.
She's out on bail, right?
That's right.
And her bond was paid by
parents from this school.
Yeah. And if they're not worried about their kids.
Then we'll worry for them.
Ask Sal, here. He'll tell you.
His kid was abused.
Same as Melinda and Teddy.
What about your child, Mr...
Venner. Frank Venner.
It's not like she didn't try with my boy.
Greg just happened to be one of the lucky ones.
Tried what?
Now, who the hell are you two?
I'm Agent Skouris. This is Agent Baldwin.
We're with NTAC.
Great.
You got here just in time.
Yeah. Cops let her go.
You can take her to quarantine or stick her back in jail.
She hasn't been found guilty of anything yet.
She's a 4400.isn't she?
She should never have been allowed
back in this school in the first place.
According to the preliminary exams.
None of the kids showed any signs of abuse.
No marks. No bruises?
No physical signs, at any rate.
So what are we talking about? Some kind of mental abuse?
Personally. I'm not convinced it's abuse at all.
But there's no denying that some of her students have been changed.
Changed?
In what way?
That was beautiful.
I guess.
You're telling me two weeks ago you'd never played a violin.
Never even touched one.
Hey, I only took this class 'cause
art appreciation's supposed to be a guaranteed "A".
You're supposed to learn about dead painters and stuff.
It's so cool.
I look at a bunch of clay.
I see the figure I want to mold.
I just carve away the pieces
I don't need and there it is.
You should see the way she stares at you.
It's like she's drilling a hole.
Trying to get in there and rearrange your brain.
One minute, she was touching my shoulder.
The next thing I remember, she was handing me a violin.
And I'm standing there wondering what the
hell am I doing with a paintbrush in my hand.
And then I see this block of clay.
And it was like.
"Where have you been all my life?
"My dad's big dream was to get me a football scholarship.
It used to be my dream, too.
But this painting stuff.
I'm really into it now.
Ms. Tobey's the best teacher I ever had in my life.
My dad says these kids may seem normal now.
But in, like, two years...
... they might develop brain tumors,
go blind, crazy...
... who knows?
You guys should throw her back in jail.
Your dad.
He wouldn't be Frank Venner,
by any chance, would he?
How'd you know?
Oh. Just...
... a wild guess.
Hurt my students?
That's so ridiculous.
Well, it's not ridiculous to these parents.
People get scared when they don't recognize their kids.
But they're still the same kids.
I just find what's already inside them and help bring it out.
How do you do that?
I study them.
Sometimes.
There's a light in their eyes.
Like a tiny flame.
And while I'm watching.
It gets brighter.
That's when I know there's something in them.
Something beautiful.
So this light, have you seen it in anyone else?
It doesn't seem to work with grownups.
It doesn't work with every kid, either.
Like this one boy, Greg Venner.
I keep looking.
But so far...
I think his father's pretty adamant that you stop looking.
Frank?
I taught Frank.
He was one of my first students back in '72.
The fact is.
I probably taught half the parents who are out to get me.
This is crazy.
I... I haven't done anything wrong.
I need to get back to my kids.
The people who took me.
It can't be an accident they gave me this wonderful gift.
That's why they sent me back.
To use it.
Tyler?
Richard Tyler?
Richard Tyler.
Yes. I'm Richard Tyler.
As wind carved the lung feel like 10 hours
what've we got show for it?
Less than 20 bucks...
What we ganna do?
Gotta make it lived.
Who's got this?
No one, friends treat...
Hey, Shawn.
Look who showed.
I was in the mood for pizza.
I didn't feel like eating alone.
So...
My very own fairy godfather.
Or are you just some rich boy looking to rent some down-and-dirty for the night?
I'm not here for that.
What's the matter? Am I not good enough for you?
Maybe I'm not good enough for you.
I can get behind that.
Yo, Wayne, pepperoni.
You going to stand there and watch.
Or you going to sit down and eat?
Hello?
Brian.
It's me, Lily.
Lily, where are you?
You know, NTAC's been calling me
all summer trying to find you.
Brian.
Look.
I need your help.
Richard, he's been arrested.
You're a lawyer.
I need you to call the sheriff's office
in Weldon, Idaho.
See what you can find out.
Well, I don't know what I can do for the guy.
I'm not a criminal lawyer.
Brian, if you don't want to help...
I swear to god, Lily...
... you disappear for over a year...
... and then you call me up with these stories
about the police arresting your boyfriend...
Richard's my husband.
We have a child.
A six-month-old girl.
How's Heidi?
She's good.
Started seventh grade and
aced her first semester.
That's wonderful.
Brian.
I'm sorry to be bothering you with this.
But I have nowhere else to turn.
Okay. I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.
I got to admit.
The first time Mike came home with that violin and started playing.
His mom and me, we were both a little spooked.
So why did you help pay Heather's bail?
I would've paid the whole thing if I could've afforded it.
My wife, she shot a video of Mike playing.
Sent it over to the conservatory.
Next day, they called back.
Said our son was a prodigy.
Did you tell them he'd been playing for only two weeks?
Well, they thought I was putting them on.
Talked about how his playing was worthy of a scholarship.
You know, I thought this kid was going to wind up
working on the assembly line like his old man.
Now he's got a way out.
Hmm.
Ms. Tobey's at NTAC today for a physical.
We're asking the parents of the students she's "gifted" to come in to be interviewed.
No problem. I'll call his mom.
We'll do anything we need to to get
Heather back in that classroom.
Great.
Thanks.
You should've seen them chowing down on the pizza.
Just getting enough to eat.
You know it's such a struggle.
And you made that struggle a little easier.
I'm proud of you, Shawn.
I'm thinking about going back down there.
There's so much they need...
jackets, sleeping bags...
... maybe a couple of first aid kits.
Basic stuff to survive, you know.
You give them all the supplies they need.
- All right.
- But look...
... whatever you do, Shawn...
... don't reveal your healing ability.
Why?
- 'Cause they can't pay?
- No.
Because if you heal one of them...
... you'll have to heal them all.
I mean it.
Not even you can do that.
Yeah.
I'm listening.
When was this?
Sweet.
I'm a little rusty.
One of these days, I'm going to write a concept album
about my time on the street.
Oh.
I'm gonna win a Grammy.
Make the bling-bling.
You know, and get a private jet.
One of those big old gated houses with enough room
for Wayne, Kimmy and Shadow.
Sounds like a plan.
Yeah, it matches your eyes, sweetie.
Hey.
First time in months I haven't seen him shivering.
It's amazing what a warm coat'll do.
You got yourself that guitar, huh?
No, actually, you know what?
I got you a guitar.
What's the matter, baby girl?
You act like you never had a present before.
It's been a while.
You touch this, you die.
- "Touch it, you die"?
- I guess so.
What does that mean?
I hate lines. Hate waiting in 'em.
Trust me, there'll be no waiting tonight.
I been to this club plenty of times.
I know the bouncer. He'll let us walk right in.
I hope you're right.
I hate waiting in lines.
Hey. That book you're reading is nothing but lies.
Excuse me.
I'm talking to you.
That trash is going to rot your mind.
Danny, what's going on?
She ought to be careful.
That book's a load of bull.
- I bought it for her.
- Yeah?
Big mistake.
Anyone ask your opinion?
Danny, come on, man.
Just watch my back, okay?
Listen, pal.
Let me tell you a little something about cults.
What's going on?
You letting me go?
Hello, Richard.
What's with the dopey grin?
Nothing, just the way that you...
you bite on your tongue when you're trying to concentrate.
I've been doing that since I was a kid.
How long have you been in Seattle?
Two years.
Left my mom and her new boyfriend
and came out here for the music.
Somehow, my life took a weird turn.
I've had a few of those myself.
What, you run away from home too?
Um...
sort of.
Except I lucked out. I found a place to run to.
Otherwise...
you would have wound up like the rest of us rejects?
Something like that.
You're one of those 4400 guys, huh?
Can you make my eyes turn green?
What, you able to walk on water?
I like your eyes the way that they are.
And I can barely swim.
Come on, now...
... what the hell is this?
Dewey...
I see you been keeping busy.
No, baby.
He's just some guy...
... bought us some food and blankets.
Liv, who is this guy?
Shawn, you got to go.
I'd listen to her.
What are you doing?
Well, see, she does whatever I tell her to do.
Do you have a problem with that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
Shawn, please.
You've done your good deed, just...
... just go home, okay?
Please.
Come with me.
Come with me.
And then what?
What, you gonna rescue me?
I don't want to be saved.
Get the hell out of here.
Go, I mean it.
Go!
Hey.
You're not going back to that school.
Not till that woman is gone.
But what about my other classes?
I've got homework.
Since when do you care about school?
You want me to wind up like you?
Hey, you watch your mouth.
I don't want to fall behind.
"Fall behind"?
With the grades you've been bringing home?
You been behind since your first report card.
What, you just going to sit there...
... or are you going to talk to me?
'Cause I really think you owe me an explanation.
You know, those guys wanted to kill me.
And I turn around.
And my cousin's nowhere in sight.
I don't know what happened.
Yeah, I know what happened... you ran out on me.
It's a good thing that security guard was there.
The other time, I could blame it on the beer.
You drink too much...
... you can black out, right?
But today, I didn't drink anything.
I'm blacking out...
... losing chunks of time.
It's like they did something to my wiring.
They?
Kyle, who are you talking about?
The same ones who took Shawn.
Who put me in the coma.
They left me messed up inside.
Hey, man, you're scaring me.
How do you think I feel?
Brian.
Any news?
Yeah, I got ahold of the Weldon authorities.
And Richard's been released from custody.
Oh, thank god.
When?
About an hour ago.
Why hasn't he called?
You sure you don't want to call Lily.
Let her know you're all right?
Am I?
You're in no danger from me, Richard.
All I want is to make you an offer.
If it's not to your liking...
... you can walk out of here.
You'll never see me again.
How much did you pay those cops to call you
instead of NTAC to get my picture into their hands?
It's my money, Richard.
Look.
You said I was free to go after I heard your offer.
If you got one for me...
... make it.
I want you to come home.
You and your family.
To the 4400 center.
I don't think so.
You said you read my book...
... which means you know why
we were taken and what we're meant to do.
The future...
The future rests in our hands, Richard.
You, me, Lily... we are the chosen ones.
Come on, Jordan.
We both know this has nothing to do with me or Lily.
This is all about Isabelle.
Isabelle...
Well, that's a lovely name.
For once.
Why don't you say what you really want...
... to take her from us. Control her.
Your daughter is the future.
I believed that then. I believe it now.
Then what's changed?
I have.
I'll need more than your word.
Of course.
Bring me to Isabelle.
Let her judge me.
Isabelle's not coming anywhere near you.
What are you afraid of, Richard?
I'm the one at risk.
I'm still suffering the after-effects of our last encounter.
Richard, it's simple.
If I'm lying.
If my motives are not pure.
Isabelle will punish me accordingly.
And you'll be free of me once and for all.
But if I'm sincere.
If Isabelle accepts me.
Well, then, I can offer you and Lily and the child a new life.
Stop running, Richard.
Forget it.
It's not going to happen.
There's no way I'm going to allow Isabelle
anywhere near that man.
But think about it.
If Collier really has changed.
It means we can get off the road.
Stop running.
That's a big if.
He offered to act as a middleman between us and NTAC.
Says he can get them to back off.
And you believe him?
He's got lawyers.
A whole organization behind him.
We can barely even pay for gas.
He's lied to us before.
The man tried to destroy our relationship.
Okay, let's say he is lying.
Maybe all of this is some kind of trap...
... to get his hands on our daughter.
He wants a face-to-face with Isabelle?
I say we give it to him.
You've seen what she's capable of...
... what she can do if she feels threatened.
It still feels like an awful big risk...
... for Collier.
Stand back, let her through.
Get out of here!
Welcome back, Heather.
I'm sorry about all of this.
Once the media loses interest.
Things will die down.
Until it does.
We need to discuss how you intend to handle security.
Let me get Heather situated.
Then I'll meet you in my office.
- Come on.
- Don't get comfortable, freak! You're not staying!
I like this one with the smoke and the clouds...
Greg.
Does your father know you're here?
It's all your fault.
Everything was okay till you showed up.
Greg.
Please put the gun down.
No.
You made me do this.
I have no choice.
Yes. You do.
But only if you put the gun away.
I can't be here anymore, my dad won't let me.
This is my last chance.
Greg, calm down...
No!
Not until you change me like you did them.
You have to!
There's nothing to discuss.
I'll take anything...
Violin...
Painting...
Photography, I don't care!
Listen, Greg.
You're problem is with me.
Not your classmates.
Let them go.
And you and I will deal with this alone.
Yeah, sure.
That works for me.
Okay.
I'd like you all to leave now.
Quietly, don't run.
Ms. Tobey, will you be okay?
Move!
Go on.
For an entire week?
Is that really necessary?
To and from school. Strictly as a precaution.
- A continued police presence will send a
clear message to anyone who feels they can...
- Okay.
So now we're alone.
Now, do what you promised!
Would you put the gun down.
- No!
- Greg?
Please, put the gun down.
It scares me.
Well, good.
It's supposed to scare you!
Greg...
D.A. says we don't have a criminal case.
Fine. We'll take it to civil court.
- One way or another...
- Excuse us.
Hey, buddy, what's your problem?
You're needed inside.
I don't feel any different.
Greg, I'm trying.
Well, try harder.
You found it in Mike, in Rita...
... you can find it in me!
I told you.
I told you she was dangerous.
None of you would listen.
She's not the one holding the gun.
Greg is a kid.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
She's got his mind all twisted.
I got news for you.
I knew everything I needed to know
the first time I talked to Greg.
You're the one who twisted his mind.
- You put that gun in his hand.
- That is not true.
We both know it's true...
and now you're the only one who's going
to get your son out of this alive.
Good.
Whatever talents they have were there to begin with.
But we're only talking about a handful of students.
You found it in them.
You can find it in me.
You have to.
Before I wind up like him...
... you know, my dad.
Is that what you're afraid of?
- You were worried she was going to damage your son?
- You know what my dad's like.
He's nothing.
He's a big, angry nothing.
And that's exactly what he wants me to be.
And I can't let that happen.
Now, goddamn it, do something!
It's no good, is it?
There's nothing there.
I'm sorry, Greg.
Not everybody's meant to be an artist or a musician.
You'll find a place.
Sure I will.
I have a talent for failure. Just like him.
You don't have to become like your father.
Somewhere along the line, he made a choice.
You can make a different one.
A better one.
She's right, Greg.
Dad?
The mistakes I made...
they're mine.
They're not yours.
Just because I failed.
It doesn't mean that you have to.
Please put down the gun, Greg.
Don't... don't let my mistakes get you killed.
Yo, Shawn!
You got to do something, man.
He's knocking the crap out of her.
What are you talking about?
Dewey sold that guitar you got Liv.
Now he's all cranked up, screaming and whatnot.
She needs you.
Come on, come on...
Liv?
I begged him.
Told him he was taking too much!
Dude's dying.
No!
No!
No!
Jesus...
... what did you do?
He brought him back.
What the hell happened?
What happened?
This guy just saved your life.
Thank you.
My leg...
... please fix it.
I'm sorry, it doesn't work like that.
Why not? You helped him.
I...
Save us!
No, I can't.
I can't help everyone.
I'm sorry.
Have mercy on us.
I'm sorry.
I can't help everyone.
I can't help everyone.
I...
I can't help everyone!
No! They need you.
You sure about this?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Lily...
good to see you.
And this is Isabelle.
Hi.
Yes.
Yes.
How's that?
Well, I guess that's it.
Good-bye fairview.
At least, this time, it's your call.
I'll find another town,
another school,
maybe work as a private tutor for a while.
I just have to figure out a way to use this gift of mine without causing so much pain.
Well, the worid could always use a little more beauty.
I hope so.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You know, I was thinking of getting Maia piano lessons.
Oh yeah?
I bet she'd like that.
Or maybe even study painting,
'cause she's always coloring.
I guess you could call that a ripple effect.
A positive one.
We are not a threat.
We are salvation.
The world will have to deal with us...
Previously on the 4400...
You know those visions that Maia used to have?
It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped.
How long have you known?
Not long.
I only found out because I read her diary.
You're one of those 4400 guys, huh?
One day.
All of this will be yours.
But you're not going anywhere.
Whatever you do, Shawn...
... don't reveal your healing ability.
Because if you heal one of them...
... you'll have to heal them all.
I'm blacking out.
If you're losing chunks of time.
You should talk to your dad about it.
What's he going to do.
Turn me over to NTAC medical?
Can I help you?
Heidi, it's mommy.
Who?
That's okay, sweetie, I got it.
She's my daughter.
She doesn't know that.
She thinks Carol is her mother.
Brian, look, I need your help.
Richard. He's been arrested.
Okay. I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.
Hello, Richard.
I want you to come home.
If I'm lying.
Isabelle will punish me accordingly.
If Isabelle accepts me.
Well, then I can offer you and Lily
and the child a new life.
Let her judge me.
Hush-a-bye
Hush-a-bye
Go to sleep little baby
When you wake I'll give you cake
And all the pretty little horses
And go to sleep-y little baby
Who's a special girl?
Is Isabelle a special girl? Is she?
Come here.
Look at him with Isabelle.
This keeps up, we're going to have
to start calling him "Uncle Jordan".
There's something so wrong about that.
Isn't there?
A week ago.
He was the one guy we were trying to keep away from her.
- And now it's like...
- They've bonded.
She's really taken to him.
Is that the couple of the hour?
Hi.
Richard, what's up, man?
It's good to see you.
Look at you.
You look great. You look great.
So how long do you guys think you're going to be staying?
We're not sure.
Collier said we could stay at the center
till we get back on our feet.
Did he get you squared away with NTAC?
Started to.
His lawyers took our statements.
I guess we're looking at back fines for not reporting in.
Well, hey,
I'm sure Jordan will take care of it.
He offered to.
But I think we're going to try and swing it ourselves.
Well, hey, you picked the right week to come.
This reunion thing's going to be big, huh?
We've got 4400s coming in from 27 different countries.
Three more maybes.
There haven't been this many of us in
the same place since quarantine.
What's happened since we left town?
I mean, suddenly it seems like
everyone's dying to meet a real, live 4400.
Yeah, well, what happened?
Jordan happened.
Welcome to the revolution, little lady, huh?
He's going to die! I saw it.
He's going to die.
Sweetheart, are you okay?
Did you have a nightmare?
No, I was awake.
And I saw it.
Tell us what you saw.
That man we watched on tv once.
What man?
Him.
Jordan Collier?
Someone's going to kill him.
So long ago, another life
I can feel your heart beat
it's not a dream remember us
I can see it in your eyes
we'll find our place in time
our place in time beyond the sun
we'll find our place in time
our place in time to call our own
As far as this department knew.
Maia wasn't having visions anymore.
Right?
Well, she was keeping them secret from me
and writing everything down in a diary.
But I'm not here to talk about my daughter.
We're here to talk about Collier.
We could talk about him all you want.
But if I was Collier.
I'd be bringing all my books back to the library.
If you know what I mean.
The kid's never wrong, right?
Look, as far as I can tell...
... Maia has two kinds of visions.
If she can see an event clearly enough in her head...
... she can sometimes influence the course of the future.
But mostly her visions are abstract.
They're more like...
... certainties.
Prophecies,
I guess you could call them.
Now, this is one of those.
And as far as I can tell...
... they're never wrong.
Well, not yet, anyway.
But nobody's made a concerted effort
to stop one of them from happening.
So we could always offer Collier a suite in the basement.
24-hour surveillance, and a food taster.
Sure. We just tell the guy
he needs to stay isolated for, what...
... a week?
A year?
When it comes to the prevention of future crime.
There are no time limits... and everyone's a suspect.
I mean, literally everyone.
So how to stop the inevitable from happening?
Stopping the inevitable...
isn't that what we deal with every day?
I mean, that's why the 4400 were sent back, right?
I like the "can-do" attitude.
But I have to ask...
do we even want to save Collier?
Well, he is kind of the bad guy.
Maybe that's the way the future wants it.
Unless they gave us this message as a way
to stop Collier's death from happening.
Fascinating.
What an extraordinary gift.
You are clear on what we're telling you?
Your daughter
has quite a track record when it comes to seeing the future.
Her latest vision involves my death.
I leave anything out?
No, that about covers it.
NTAC is offering you all its resources.
That means round-the-clock protection,
threat assessment...
And I'm meant, of course, to isolate myself?
Well, that would be the safest move.
Let's say I'm willing to assume
good faith on your part... which...
... given your exploitation of the 4400
to get to me, is rather generous...
What, you think we made this up?
I'm not sure you're that creative.
But your plan does call for my total
withdrawal from the public eye
and cancellation of a celebration of the public interest
in the 4400 that's been months in the planning.
Our history with each other is what it is.
But this is real.
And denial is not a luxury you can afford.
Thank you for the information.
I'll keep it in mind.
Maia is never wrong.
Whatever protection you can afford me.
I can afford myself.
Pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out.
The foreign returnees' stories are particularly inspirational.
Still come here every thursday, huh?
Thought I might get lucky.
Lily.
What are you doing here?
I'm back in Seattle.
I just wanted to thank you for helping Richard.
Just a couple of phone calls.
It was no big deal.
We were in a bad spot.
You did what you could. It meant a lot.
Well, you really didn't have to get me anything.
It's actually for Heidi.
Her birthday's coming up.
Oh, Lily...
It's just a cool little handbag.
You don't have to tell her it's from me.
I don't want to mess with your life, Brian.
I'm just trying to say "thank you".
Okay.
You're looking well, Lily.
I'm glad things are working out.
I can't talk to first keys today.
There's too much going on with this party.
But class starts in 10 minutes.
I can't do it, Lucy.
You're just going to have to tell them
to think of it as a study hall.
Um... this is outgoing.
Thank you.
You guys come for the tour?
Could we talk to you outside?
Kind of a bad day.
It's pretty crazy around here.
Told you he'd blow us off.
What's up?
Oh, Liv.
They were too embarrassed to come inside.
I can't. I can't.
But I saw what you can do.
We all did.
You can heal people.
Listen, it's not that simple.
I can't heal everyone.
I'm not asking you to heal everyone.
Just them.
You don't understand.
It's like it drains me.
I can do it for maybe one.
Maybe.
One is better than none.
And who chooses that one, Wayne?
You? Me?
I can't heal the world. I'm sorry.
What'd I tell you?
Waste of time...
Don't look at me like that.
Kyle?
Hey, you with us, Buddy?
What?
I thought you were...
... you know... elsewhere.
No, I'm right here with you.
Was just thinking. Relax.
I haven't had one of those blackouts in a couple of days.
I'm hoping that's all done.
Yeah, I do too.
But I still think you should tell your dad
about it and get yourself checked out.
You want to go with me to see the kills?
Okay.
So we're ignoring the whole blackout thing, or...
Pretty much.
They go on at 8:00.
You should come.
The TSA is putting a flag on Ian Dravitt and his known associates.
They'll call us if anyone shows up in Seattle.
This whole Dravitt thing is just Collier's latest deal gone south.
Collier had his name on the side of a
skyscraper by the time he was 30.
You pursue power that ruthlessly.
You pick up some enemies along the way.
So we find the one who seems most
like John Hinckley or Sirhan Sirhan.
And then do what?
Follow him around for the rest of his natural life?
We could spend the next year looking at
Collier's moves since he founded the center.
The guy had a whole career before he got abducted.
Or maybe it is coming from someone who Collier's never met.
I mean, if you hate the 4400...
... killing their figurehead's a good way
to make them suffer.
But what are we supposed to do?
The potential victim has refused our help.
No one said stopping the future was going to be easy.
Diana, look at this.
His name is Miles Quinlan.
Claims Collier bankrupted him.
Then kicked him out of the center.
Lives with his parents
What.
Nursing a persecution complex?
Pretty much a poster boy for the lone gunman theory.
Come on, Maia,
I've named every guy
I've dated for like the last five years.
Are you telling me I don't have a future with any of them?
I wouldn't worry about it.
Seems like you meet a lot of boys.
Yeah, well, that's the trouble.
I'm tired of meeting boys.
I want to meet a man.
You will.
When?
Aunt April.
Just because I don't see it doesn't
mean it's not going to happen.
Oh. That's probably Mrs. Bradshaw from upstairs.
She's going to watch you tonight while I go to work.
I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.
You recognize me.
You're Jordan Collier.
I didn't mean to frighten her.
I just wanted to talk to her for a minute.
Yeah, well,
doesn't look like that's going to happen.
She believes I'm going to die.
Please give her my apologies.
I brought this for her.
I hope she doesn't already have one.
Thanks.
Hi. I'm Lily Tyler.
- I think someone was asking for me-
- Excuse me.
Heidi...
Are you my mother?
I heard them fighting about you.
My mom and dad... Carol.
It's okay that I still call her "mom", right?
I know it's confusing, baby.
Just 'cause they're talking in the other
room doesn't mean I can't hear them.
They said you were one of the 4400.
That's why I was gone.
That's why we don't know each other.
Didn't you come to our house once?
It's the first thing I did when I got back.
I wanted to see you.
But your dad and I.
We weren't sure it was a good idea.
Sweetie, does your father know you came down here?
No.
I didn't tell them I heard.
I didn't go to school today.
I came here instead.
I'm glad you did.
Was it hard for you not to see me?
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
I think about you every single day.
Look at this.
Is that me?
That was the day we brought
you back from the hospital.
You look the same as you do now.
I was gone so long. But...
... to me...
... this feels like yesterday.
You want to talk about Collier?
He uses people up and leaves them on the curb.
Is that why you left the center?
I didn't leave. They threw me out.
That's what happens when you run out of money.
They have all these different levels.
They call them keys, right?
You make seventh key, you're unlocked.
"Unlocked"... meaning you've got your own 4400 ability?
Well, that's the big prize.
Only they set it up so no one ever gets there.
There's mid-levels and side seminars you have to pass.
If you're not one of the 4400, each one costs.
First I ate up my savings.
Then I cashed out the equity in my house.
And they didn't deliver.
Soon as the first check bounced.
They told me I'd reached maximum
potential and sent me on my way.
Is that why you applied for a handgun permit?
We ran a vicap check on you this morning.
So I bought a gun.
So what?
I need to protect myself from Collier.
Yeah, well,
I hope self-defense is all you have in mind.
Because if you're planning anything else.
We will be all over you the minute you approach the 4400 center.
You want something to be paranoid about? Think about that.
You're simplifying the issue.
Canceling the gala is no guarantee of my safety.
It's a start.
Jordan, you just told me there's a little girl out there
who can see the future and she saw you dead.
It's time to make yourself scarce.
And where does it stop?
Do I stay away from the center?
I cut myself off from our work?
Yeah, if it means staying alive.
I am not going to become a hermit.
That is not a win for us.
Look, the center is significantly safer than it seems.
Half the people you see in workmen's
uniforms are bodyguards.
Are you looking to die in public?
You're developing a real flair for drama.
You know, this is hanging over my head.
Not yours.
Look, I'm sorry, Jordan.
I'm just-
I am not ready to become a martyr.
And you don't have to be.
I know you've been looking forward
to this weekend for a long time.
Bringing all the 4400 together.
It's like a validation for everything you've done so far.
But if something happens to you.
It could undo everything that we've started.
The movement's not ready for you to be a martyr, either.
Just...
Go. Go.
Where'd you go? I was about to have them page you.
Richard, there's someone I want to introduce to you.
This is my daughter.
Heidi.
She came to the center to meet me.
We've been talking.
Well.
It's very nice to meet you.
I'm Richard Tyler. I'm married to Lily...
... your mother.
She told me.
It's nice to meet you, too.
Is that...
Isabelle.
This is your half-sister.
Don't be scared.
I'm sorry.
She must be hungry.
It's okay.
I should probably get home anyway.
Well, I hope I can see you again.
I hope so, too.
Maybe next time I can hold Isabelle.
I bet we could make that happen.
I'll walk you out.
No more cutting school, okay?
What's the matter?
All I'm saying is he was taller than I pictured him.
Well, tall or short,
Collier had no business showing up here.
I totally agree, Di.
I didn't let him in.
Aunt April likes tall boys.
Oh, so you're talking about men to my daughter?
She's a child.
It might have come up in passing.
Hey, mom?
How come you never go out on dates?
Well, I wouldn't say never.
But aunt April goes out all the time.
Well, I think your aunt's an extreme example.
How do I know which one is right?
Not many or lots?
I think that you should probably shoot
for somewhere in the middle.
I'll try.
But do dates always have to be with boys?
They're so gross.
You get used to them.
Can we have this conversation,
like, in two or three...
... maybe 10 years?
What's that?
Oh, a lady dropped it off today.
Oh, it's a subpoena.
What's that?
Well, it's when someone wants you
to give them something.
Who's it from?
It's from my bosses.
What do they want?
Your diary.
Kyle! You okay, man?
You didn't have a drink, did you?
Just diet coke.
It's really loud in there, huh?
Yeah, but they're great, huh?
You want to go back in?
Come on, my buddy's saving us a spot by the stage.
Do you know what time it is?
What are you doing here?
Kyle! Do you know what time it is?
What are you doing outside my apartment?
I don't know, I was at the pub.
You're scaring me.
How long have you been out here?
I don't know...
I think I was digging or something.
Look, Kyle, I think you should go.
- We can talk about this-
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
It just happened again.
Let me in.
Get your hands off of me! You don't understand.
He's a fraud. All of you.
Do you hear me?
Your golden boy is a big fraud.
Liv, you need to calm down.
It's okay, guys, I got it.
My whole life.
I have been looking for just one thing.
Just one thing to believe in.
I thought it was you.
How long ago did you get high?
You gonna help me up or what?
Are you going to stop yelling at me?
I am done with you altogether.
Go back to your penthouse.
Pretend we don't exist.
Everyone else does.
Why not you?
Listen...
easy.
I'm not going to send you off into the night like this.
You can sleep on my couch.
I got you.
It's okay.
You started all this, you know.
Everything around you took shape
after you showed me where to go.
I don't know what to do, though.
I could count the number of times I've
said that on one hand.
But right now it's true.
That's right. If you know anything...
... now would be a good time
to tell uncle Jordan, huh?
Oh...
... thank you.
Thank you.
The reunion goes forward.
Diana. One of Dravitt's hired guns
flew into town last night.
His name is Laurent Ganning.
TSA had his alias flagged.
Well, do we have a present whereabouts?
He just checked into a motel in first hill
under the name "Lawrence Gawain".
It's clear.
Tom...
he's on the move.
Wendy, wait.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
You were waiting in the hallway
outside my apartment last night.
Do you know how weird that is?
I don't know how I got there, please.
Believe me, I...  I...
I had another blackout last night.
Look, Kyle, this is getting bad.
And I can't give you the kind of help that you need.
So you want me to just go away?
No, I...
I want you to talk to someone.
Someone qualified.
I'm scared for you.
Scared for me or scared of me?
And we are humbled by the bravery
of our foreign guests.
Many of whom risked so much to be here today...
You know, Glen....
... I'm getting some nasty echos.
Can we adjust the levels on the speakers in the back?
Testing. Testing.
One, two, three, testing.
You know, that's a lot better.
Nobody moves!
Everyone stay right where you are.
Don't move. Don't move!
Get your hands on your head.
Get them up. Turn around.
Turn around!
Get down. Down.
Down!
Ganning's pistol was made from synthetic polymers.
The bullets, too.
He walked it right through your metal
detectors without so much as a peep.
You were round to get him.
He never would have killed me.
He was standing two feet away
from you with a loaded firearm.
The whole thing was put in motion by Maia.
Your daughter's vision was a gift to me.
A prescription, if you will.
For changing the future.
In one chain of events.
Ganning's bullet killed me.
I can only assume that somebody
has a different plan for me.
Well, I wouldn't be putting my feet up by the fire just yet.
I have no intention of canceling the extra security measures.
The same extra measures that just allowed
an assassin to walk right up to you.
Would NTAC like a presence at the gala tomorrow?
Yes.
Mr. Collier, we don't stand off to the side and watch.
We take command.
I'll issue credentials.
That was a rather dramatic demonstration
of competence just now.
What time is it?
It's about 2:00.
How'd I end up here, anyway?
Liv, you were pretty far gone last night.
But are you really telling me you don't remember?
I remember.
You don't have to hover over me.
I'm not going to steal anything.
The maid can come in and clean the
couch as soon as I'm gone.
How many of these nights do you
think you have left in you?
Hopefully not too many.
You've seen my life.
When I OD....
It's not gonna be any big loss.
That is not true.
How's it going to change?
I used to feel the same way.
I meant what I told you.
I can't save the whole world.
And I can't even save your friends.
And I'm sorry.
But if you're serious about wanting a change.
Maybe I can save you.
How?
By giving you the same thing that saved me.
He's here.
Hi, good to see you.
Excuse me.
Hello, my love.
Here we go.
I think I have to...
nice to meet you
Pleasure to see you.
Excuse me, sir.
All the guests check out so far.
Yeah, we secured the surrounding rooftops.
Did a bomb sweep.
So now it's cross-our-fingers time.
Yeah.
Good afternoon.
Thank you for coming to the center.
We have a great day planned for you.
But before we get started.
I'd like to thank the man that made this all possible.
I mean that literally... he didn't just pay for the food.
He built this place.
And this movement.
So I'd like you to please welcome my mentor.
My friend... Mr. Jordan Collier.
Thank you.
And thank you, Shawn,
for that introduction.
We are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests.
Many of whom risked so much to be here today.
Let's go.
I just want to hear what the man has to say for himself.
Jordan?
He's up there! Go!
Everybody stay down!
We've got a shooter.
Everyone calm down!
Just stay down. Stay down!
We've got a shooter.
Let me go.
Jordan! Oh, my god!
Oh, god...
Please let me go, please!
Get that stretcher ready.
Pulse is weak and thready come on let's go hurry up!
Breathing's stopped.
We're losing him again.
No! You're not going anywhere yet.
Shawn! She told me to go through with it.
Who did?
She lies.
No...
Don't go anywhere, no...
- Lily, I need to-
- Brian, I don't have much time.
I did not violate our agreement.
Heidi found me.
Lily.
Heidi's sick.
She's in the hospital.
It happened yesterday.
Something with her spleen.
They had to operate right away.
Is she okay?
Can I see her?
She's okay.
She's still recovering from the anesthesia.
She's been asking for you.
She's still in recovery now.
But Carol thinks it's all right if you
want to get in there tomorrow.
Brian, what happened?
Her spleen? She's 12 years old.
It just ruptured.
Her doctors said they've never seen anything like it.
Even they can't tell us why.
Where you been?
The funeral's about to start.
Lily, what's wrong?
What is it?
Heidi's sick.
And I think Isabelle's responsible.
I think they're ready for you.
You are going to read a lot about
Jordan Collier in the next few weeks.
Some of it good.
A lot of it bad...
I will be ignoring all of it.
Just like Jordan would have.
Because Jordan may have used the media.
But he never allowed himself to be seduced by it.
I could tell you how much I owe the man.
He took me in when I was feeling
lost and alone... confused.
I'm sure many of you have similar stories.
The fact is that everyone alive today.
Whether they know it or not.
Owes Jordan Collier.
He had a vision to save the future.
And he gave us that vision.
And now he won't be here to see us achieve it...
but we will achieve it.
I promise you.
We will achieve it.
We have all suffered a tremendous loss.
We are heartbroken and bleeding on the inside.
But we will not let that stop us.
And I will not let that stop me.
We will honor Jordan Collier.
And we will create the better future that he died building.
Thank you for coming.
Goodbye.
Nice words, Shawn.
I think Collier would have approved.
Yeah, I hope so.
He would have liked that you came.
Oh, I don't think I was that high on his radar.
Don't be too sure.
You guys bumped heads.
But you believed the same thing.
That the 4400 are the key to the future.
Your goals were identical.
But our methods were different.
Not as different as you think.
See, that's where your view of
Jordan Collier splits from mine.
Well, at least we have some common ground.
Maybe your side and my side can work together
now that I'm assuming new duties around here.
You're becoming quite the little politician, Shawn.
Now I know Collier would have been proud of you.
He's gone!
His body,
it's not there!
Someone stole the body.
There's only one way out.
And we were standing right in front of it,
stole it how?
Then what happened?
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world
will have to deal with us.
I'm not your little brother
anymore.
Then stop acting
like a two-year-old.
You're my brother.
She's your girlfriend.
It's all good.
You goddamn freak!
Danny, stop it!
Stop blaming me for Nikki!
Diana Skouris,
your adoption of Maia Rutledge
is hereby complete.
He's gonna die.
I saw it. He's gonna die.
Jordan Collier?
Someone's going to kill him.
No!
No!
His body,
it's not there!
This is
your new house?
It's yours too.
I've been looking forward
to this moment for too long.
Only one thing
missing--
Mom.
We really tried to make it work.
How was your first day
of college?
I didn't have one.
Nobody paid my tuition.
I'm sorry, Kyle.
I must have forgot.
You've been talking
about this for months.
How could you forget?
You spent three years
in a coma.
You have no business
drinking anything!
You told me everything
that happened that night, right?
Yeah.
Any coffee left?
Help yourself.
Couldn't find a clean t-shirt?
This is what I wear
to school.
I like it.
You're looking sharp.
Thanks.
So...
How you doing, dad?
Good.
Fine. Why?
No reason.
Just, uh...
... you know, good luck.
Okay?
I'll be thinking
about you.
I'll call you.
See how it goes.
Okay?
See you.
Hey,
there he is!
What's all this?
Welcome back.
The prodigal son returns.
Returns from where?
Get your gear on.
We got to roll.
Tom, I am so glad
to see you.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
As soon as we take
Doherty down,
we're going to
pop the champagne.
Doherty?
Who's Doherty?
Diana, stop.
Fill me in here.
Who's Doherty?
Does he have something
to do with Collier's murder?
What, governor Collier?
What are you talking about?
He's not dead.
This was
Garrity's idea, right?
Got to admit,
it's creative,
but "screw with
Tom Baldwin day" is over.
Hey, listen, Tom,
don't do this.
The doctors gave you
a clean bill of health.
Doctors?
What doctors?
Where is everybody headed?
And what the hell is going on
around here today?
I think you should
probably just stay here.
We'll talk
when I get back.
Diana, just--
So, this guy, Doherty,
is he a 4400?
What's a 4400?
Please, stop this.
Four thousand, four hundred
missing people...
... the future sent them back
in a ball of light.
Any of this
sound familiar?
Diana,
I'm not laughing,
so whatever game
you're playing,
stop it, and stop it right now.
Tom, whatever
you've been through
in the past few months,
I can't even
imagine it,
and everyone here is pulling
for your recovery,
but you've got to
listen to yourself.
You sound delusional.
The future?
I mean, I've never
heard of the 4400,
and I can promise you
that nobody ever came back
in a ball of light.
Tell me one thing.
According to you,
what have we been doing
for the last year?
You're serious.
Humor me.
It's your case,
Tom.
Dirty bombs,
remember?
You went undercover
and infiltrated
an Aum Shinrikyo terror cell.
None of this means anything
to you, does it?
Of course not.
Why should it?
Well, your cover
was compromised.
They held you
for three weeks.
Sleep deprivation,
torture--
They'd have killed you
if you didn't escape.
So how does Doherty
fit in?
Aum Shinrikyo's been planning
an attack on the U.S.
since they've been sneaking
radioactive material
into the country
in museum pouches.
Doherty's the curator.
He's been in bed with them
all along.
Tom, he sold you out.
You spent three weeks in hell
'cause of this guy.
You've been
on medical leave
for two months,
recovering, and...
... obviously,
it should have been three.
Jordan Collier
museum of contemporary art.
Tell me you recognize
this place.
I recognize it, all right...
Well, that's a start.
But everything's different.
This is the spot.
This is where Collier got shot.
Do me a favor.
Don't let anyone else
hear you say that.
Tom?
Tom!
Is he in there?
Yeah, I think so.
You want to do
the honors?
Did you find
anything?
Somebody's been messing
with my computer.
All my case files are gone.
I type "4400"
into a search engine, and...
Nothing.
How could there not be
a single mention of them?
I don't know.
Maybe because...
... none of it ever happened?
Something has obviously changed.
This is not the same world
that it was yesterday.
But I'm still Tom Baldwin,
and you're still Diana Skouris,
which means that the people
they took,
they exist too, right?
Gary Navarro.
We worked with him last month.
He could read thoughts.
Read thoughts?
Tom, come on.
Played for Cincinnati?
Lifetime. 317 batting average.
Isn't it 300?
When you know what
the pitcher's thinking?
But... he was never taken!
Richard Tyler.
What did he have?
Heat vision?
No, some of them
can do... things.
Some of them...
some of them can't.
He's dead.
He's plane was shot down
over Sinanju in 1951.
So that's two down.
Are we going to go through
all 4,398 more?
I'll take my boots off
if we are.
Diana, your daughter.
Your daughter!
Your daughter, Maia Rutledge.
You adopted her,
right?
She's one of them.
Tom, don't include me
in your fantasy life.
You know I don't have
a daughter.
Yes! Right here.
It's a Seattle address
for Maia Rutledge.
It's right here.
Right here.
Oh, thank god.
Maia, it's me.
It's me, Tom.
Tom Baldwin.
I don't know you.
Don't say that, please.
- Don't say that.
- My name is Ella.
Maia's my grandmother.
Ella, who is it?
Oh, here she is.
This is my grandmother.
You're Maia Rutledge?
Can I help you?
Didn't expect you home
so soon.
How'd you do out there
today?
Glad to see you, too.
Everything okay?
Just tell me one thing.
You were in a coma
for three years, right?
If I have one more of these,
I could wind up in a coma
right now.
Come on.
I want to show you
something.
Come on.
Uncle Tommy.
We can eat, finally.
How you doing?
Shawn, what are you doing here?
Well, the band
got delayed in Berlin.
We're not going to start
recording until tuesday.
Besides, I couldn't miss
your big day.
Or Danny's.
Come on, tell them.
Believe it or not,
she actually said "yes".
We're getting married.
Look, he bought me this!
Oh, I told him
I didn't even want one
till he was
out of law school.
I like that.
You like that?
Are you all right, Mr. Baldwin?
Dad, do you
need to sit?
It can't be a joke.
There's too many people
in on it.
Sit down.
So then either
I'm cracking up,
or the world is.
Dad, the doctors said
you were okay.
I don't want to scare you,
but something's wrong.
I don't recognize
this place.
I mean,
I sort of do,
but everything's
been tweaked.
Dad, dad,
look at me.
You're not making
any sense.
You know that,
right?
You guys started
without us?
Just as well.
Airport traffic was insane.
Hi, guys, Nikki.
Can you believe my kid,
my youngest kid,
is getting married?
When the hell
did we get so old?
So you're back in the saddle.
How'd it go?
I don't think it went too good.
Really? I was just
telling your wife
that you were going
to be fine.
My wife?
I'm still married to Linda?
I said wife, not ex-wife.
Alana, over here.
Come here.
I've never seen this woman
before.
I think we need to be alone...
Go upstairs. Talk.
No. I don't know who you are.
Dad, Alana's
your wife.
You've been married to her
for two years.
She lives here, dad.
I don't know what any of you are
talking about, but it's over.
It's over,
it's over.
How'd you find me?
Guys downstairs called.
They said you've been
here four hours.
Yeah.
Sad, isn't it?
The only place
I feel normal
is hiding
in a storage closet.
I guess that's what it must
feel like to be insane--
You're not insane, Tom.
You just need a rest.
Everyone keeps telling me
I was tortured.
Maybe they broke my mind.
You're going to come back
from this, Tom.
It's just going
to take some time.
And I'm going to help you,
I promise.
So tell me again
about this ball of light.
When did you first come
to believe it happened?
August 14th, 2004.
That's when they came back.
Maybe not in the world you know,
but it happened in mine--
Get her out of here!
No one's plotting against you, Tom.
I did what I had to do
to get you better.
His wife's here.
She's asking to see him.
I am not married.
I am not married...
Look, lady, I don't
know who you are,
and I don't care
what you have to say.
You have to
play along.
I need you to
get out of here
so we can figure out
what's going on.
What are you talking about?
None of this is real
to me, either.
I know we're
not married.
I've never seen you
before yesterday.
The things you talk about--
The ball of light,
the 4400...
You know about the 4400?
Know of them?
I am a 4400.
I know my behavior
was totally out of line,
and I want to apologize.
I got fixated
on getting back to work,
and obviously,
the strain, the, uh...
The excitement,
it was just too much.
We're going to extend
your medical leave
by another six weeks,
and then we will see about
getting you back out in the field.
I'll circle the date.
Okay.
So I can go now?
Your psych hold is over.
Great.
I'm...
I'm sorry for the ambush.
Desperate times,
desperate measures.
I'll see you
in six weeks.
Tom Baldwin.
Alana Mareva.
So I guess we're married.
So I'm told.
Let's go home.
See if we can figure out
what the hell is going on.
- Where do you think we are?
- I don't know.
Maybe we crossed into
some kind of...
... alternate reality,
a different dimension.
I know.
It sounds insane.
It sounds impossible.
Impossible
isn't what it used to be, and...
... you're a 4400.
You think I'm doing this?
It's an explanation.
A pretty simple one, actually.
Simple, but wrong.
If I were making this up,
why would I put myself
in the middle of your life?
I'm sorry. This can't
be easy for you, either.
Yeah, easy.
My friends, my family,
everything I know is gone.
Erased.
I'm trapped
in the middle of your life.
How do I know it's not you
making this up?
Erased?
What do you mean,
your life has been erased?
I used to own
this place.
I bought it
four years ago,
a few months
before I was abducted.
And none of this
looks familiar now?
I was my own buyer.
I flew all over the world
And bought
mostly sculptures,
primitive art.
Excuse me.
Can I talk to the owner?
He's not here today.
Any idea
when he opened this place?
A long time ago.
15, maybe 20 years.
It only gets worse.
You're sure
that's the right bench?
I used to come here
every week.
Believe me, I know which bench
I dedicated
to my husband and son.
So back in the world
we came from...
They died.
In a car accident.
Shortly before I was abducted.
There's a way back home.
We're going to find it.
If you need anything,
I'll be right down the hall.
What, you're sleeping
in the guest room?
Under the circumstances,
yeah.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
We have to play along.
We're supposed to be
happily married.
We don't want your son
asking questions.
Okay, I'll, uh, find a spot
on the floor.
Are you sure you wouldn't be
more comfortable in the bathtub?
I'm kidding, Thomas.
It's a big bed.
I'm sure we can keep
in our own sectors.
Do you think
we're the only ones?
Are there other people out there
like us,
wondering how
they got here?
If there are, we'll find them.
We'll take out
classified ads
in every major city paper.
"Remember the 4400s?
Drop us a line".
We'll check out every returnee
we can find.
Tell me
something about yourself.
What do you want to know?
Favorite records?
Where I went to school?
How about your husband and son?
What were they like?
Paul was a radiologist.
We met while he was on vacation
in Tahiti.
That's where I'm from.
Linda and I thought about
going there for our honeymoon.
We picked Haiti instead.
Two years later,
after we were married,
we had Billy.
He was so quiet and sweet.
This is unbelievable.
I think this was
the interview
where I said I wanted
to go into medicine
because nurses
are sexy.
You did not
say that.
I got into medical school!
Stanford, baby!
Congratulations.
The real Kyle used to talk
about being a doctor all the time.
Right up
until he went into a coma.
"The real Kyle..."
I know
that's not exactly your son,
but he seems pretty real to me.
He gets happy
when he hears good news,
cranky when he gets tired,
and he forgets to put
the toilet seat down.
He's a good kid.
He was raised well.
I got a response
from our ad in the post.
Philip Kendrick.
He wants to meet us.
Philip Kendrick?
Tom Baldwin.
What do you remember
about the 4400?
It was the best sedan
Citroen ever put out.
Hydraulics came standard
on every model--
You're talking
about a car?
Yeah!
Mine's parked outside.
Where's yours?
It's in the shop.
I'll send you a picture.
Uh, Tom,
I don't have your address.
Well, that was
productive.
Yeah...
Should we check out
the Blake exhibit
while we're here?
Uh... yeah,
why don't you...
Why don't you
go ahead?
I'll catch up with you
in a minute.
No, it's...
Thomas...
Thomas...
Thomas?
Thomas!
It's gone.
What's gone?
That door. It was back.
And I opened it this time.
It was some kind of
operating room, I think.
I didn't see
anything like that.
You were just standing
there like a statue.
That room's the answer.
It has to be.
It's the only thing
that doesn't fit.
It's not part
of this reality.
If it even exists.
You're the only one
who can see it--
I have to get back there.
Hey, partner.
Black, two sugars.
So the guards tell me
That you spent...
Five hours here yesterday,
three the day before that,
and, one saturday,
you logged up 12.
Yeah, so I like art.
It's a nice,
functional door, Tom,
but I wouldn't call it
a work of art.
Now, maybe if it were made
of black obsidian...
I read your psych file.
You planning on having me
locked up again, Diana?
You know, this other reality
that you're anxious
to get back to?
I mean, even if you could
get back to it,
it doesn't sound
that great, Tom.
Back there,
you were divorced.
Here, you have
a beautiful wife.
Back there,
you son, Kyle,
spent four years
in a coma.
Here, he's about to spend
four in medical school.
Back there, your sister's family
is completely dysfunctional,
your nephew is in a cult,
and the future of the world
is in jeopardy.
You make it sound so... bleak.
It's just a...
Just life.
This is life,
and it's a better life for you
and for everyone you care about.
Just accept
what you have.
Because if you don't,
well, you're going to spend
the rest of your life
just sitting in this hallway.
Alana?
What's the matter?
Have you seen
these pictures?
Look at all the things
we've done together.
You know, you'd think
if we're trapped here,
they would give us
these memories.
You know?
Look, we've been to China.
I've wanted to go
my entire life to China.
Look, Alana, I don't know
how long it's going to take
for us to get out of here.
I don't know.
Who says we will?
You keep talking
about that door.
It's been a month already.
What if
it never comes back?
Then we're trapped, okay,
then we're trapped.
I don't...
But if we are,
Alana,
I promise you,
we will make new memories.
Just as good as these.
Better.
Oh, I believe we could, Thomas.
I like it
when you call me that.
"Thomas".
And this goes up, and then...
Ugh, I can never get
these things right.
Let me take a shot.
Come here. Hold still.
You got to remember
to make big loops.
Leave yourself
a little room to work with.
Hands
of a surgeon.
Hands of a resident,
more like.
No, you'll get there.
So how do you like it
over at St. Bede's?
The hours are killer.
Doctors treat me like
a glorified candystriper.
A good night's sleep
is a distant memory.
I love it.
Well, I look
like I belong
on top of a wedding cake.
Hey, you brought this
on yourself.
Some people go to Fiji
for their 10th anniversary.
You two wanted
to renew your vows.
Yeah, well,
the first time
just felt like
pictures in a book.
This one...
This one is for me and Alana.
Ready to go, champ?
And do you,
Alana Baldwin,
also renew your
commitments to honor, obey,
and love
your husband, Thomas,
till death
do you part?
I do.
Then by the power
vested in me,
I now pronounce you
still man and wife.
Go ahead. You may kiss
your beautiful bride.
I'm getting in here.
Oh, I love you guys.
So how do you feel,
Mrs. Baldwin?
Married. Finally.
Feels real now, huh?
Well, it felt real
for a long time.
It's hard to believe
we resisted it.
Do you miss it?
Your old life?
I still think about it,
but after
all these years,
that life, that world--
That feels
like the delusion.
I know.
I have to concentrate
to even remember
a life without you.
See, I'm good that way.
Like a cellphone
or TiVo.
Once you've got me,
you can't imagine
not having me.
I love you, Thomas.
It still kills me
when you call me that.
Come here, woman.
You're resigning?
I'm moving on, Tom.
I've been here
11 years.
The private sector beckons.
Dennis Ryland offered me
a partnership
in his consulting firm.
Nice gig.
So you're moving to Virginia?
Three weeks.
Look, D.C. has asked me
to submit a list of names
as potential replacements.
I'm giving them one.
Yours.
Well, I'm-- I'm flattered.
I, uh...
But you might need
a backup or two.
I mean,
somewhere in my personnel file
are measurements
for my straitjacket.
Nah, you were
convalescing
from injuries
received in the line of duty.
Your service in that case
was heroic.
I think you can talk your
way around the fallout.
That is, if you want the job.
A chance to sit
in the big chair?
I want it, all right.
Good.
Then practice saying,
"nice to meet you too, senator".
Best way to prep for
your confirmation hearing.
I'll spring
for a new suit.
My last act
as head of this division
will be to make sure
that this happens.
Congratulations, Tom.
You've earned this.
Thank you.
Guess what.
Don't tell me.
You just spoke to Jarvis.
You knew?
She might have
mentioned something.
And you didn't
tell me?
I'm transferring you
to Greenland.
Oh, look,
he's not even confirmed yet,
and he's mad with power.
Baldwin.
Hey, you're not
going to believe this.
They've just asked me
to join the board of directors
at the Collier museum.
Wow. That's... quite an honor.
Do you think I should take it?
The best museum
on the west coast.
You got to take it.
There's a benefit
at the "Seattle Inner City
Arts Council" on friday night.
They want
to introduce me around.
I didn't put my tux
back into storage.
So it, um...
Looks like we both got a little
surprise at the office today.
What do you mean?
Are you sitting down?
Just tell me, Thomas.
Honey, I'll see you
at home tonight.
Glendon Ritter,
C.E.O. of Stradwick Pharmaceuticals.
Isn't he president
of the arts council?
Well, you should go
say hello.
You come with.
No, no, you...
you go.
I'm all out
of small talk.
Go ahead.
Mr. Ritter.
So happy
you could make it.
Thomas?
Do you see it?
No.
Why? You do?
It's been gone
for eight years.
Why now?
Come back downstairs with me.
That's the way out. It...
... it has to be.
And if it is...
... and you walk through it...
... what happens to all of this?
To us?
I don't know.
And I don't want to find out.
I want to go to Washington
next month,
and I want to watch you
get promoted.
I want to see who Kyle marries.
So do I...
But this door, it's...
... it's back for a reason.
It's like
it wants me to walk through it.
But do you want
to walk through it?
I don't want you to, either.
Come on, Thomas.
Let's go home.
Kyle!
No, Kyle's my son!
Leave me alone! He's my son!
Kyle!
Stop.
Let go of me!
What...
Congratulations.
You made it.
Where are we?
I think you know.
This is where
they brought you...
... and the rest of the 4400.
Yes, this is where
they altered us--
Gave me the ability
to create the world
we've been living in
for the last eight years.
So it is you.
You've been doing this
the whole time.
We've been living
in my mind,
but the instructions
for your reality
came from them.
They created
a sanctuary for you,
an easier,
less complicated world.
But none of it's real.
You are.
I am.
The feelings
we have for each other are
as real as anything
we've ever experienced.
Is that why they did this?
Kept us here for eight years?
Because they wanted us
to fall in love?
Moments.
That's all that's passed,
but in those
few seconds,
we've accumulated
years of memories
that will bond us
in the real world.
I thought they were worried
about saving the world,
not playing matchmaker.
They're worried
about you.
Your life
is about to plunge into crisis.
Your mission
will be threatened.
They can't allow this to happen.
They gave you this relationship
as a source of strength,
to sustain you
in the trials
that lay ahead.
What crisis? What--
What is it?
Why can't they just tell me
what it is?
I can stop it from happening.
It's already begun...
... but now you won't have to
face it alone.
No, if it's started,
I have to get back there.
Only your wife
can get you home.
You are my wife.
No.
I'm part of the program
they placed in her mind.
She has no idea
she's creating this.
If she did,
it would interfere
with the bonding.
So, what, I'm supposed
to just fill her in
and tell her what?
Whether she knows it or not,
she's willing this world
into existence.
She can will it
out of existence.
Yeah, and what if
she doesn't want to?
You have to
convince her.
That will be the first test
of your relationship.
They've created a damn near
perfect world for me.
What if I don't want to leave?
Then the future
picked the wrong man.
What about Kyle?
He spent nine years
becoming a doctor.
What, am I supposed
to get rid of him?
Wish him away?
It's not really Kyle.
Don't say that!
If it's not Kyle,
who's moving around
downstairs in the kitchen?
Kyle. Shawn. Danny.
None of them are real.
They're just projections.
You've spent eight years
with these people.
They're as real to you
as they are to me.
I love my family.
I really do love them.
It's not that I want to do this.
It's that we have to do it.
But they're my family, too.
Back there,
I'm just a stranger to them.
What about you and me?
Our life?
Is that a projection, too?
No.
What we have, our memories,
they'll carry over
into the real world.
But it won't be the same.
It can't be.
Maybe not,
but whatever we have,
it'll be real.
What are you doing?
Make it go away.
What do I do?
Stare at it until it disappears?
No, just believe
it's not there.
Well, thanks
for coming, everybody.
Alana and I just wanted
to tell you all that...
... we're going to be
leaving.
We're taking
a vacation.
We'll be gone
for a while, and, uh...
I know it's sudden,
but we just decided
this morning.
Well,
how long is a while?
I mean, you just got the biggest
promotion of your career.
It'll have to wait.
We wanted to see you all
one last time before we go,
and tell you...
How much we love you.
That's so sweet.
Careful, Alana.
She's going to be crying
in a second.
It's something
we have to do.
It's a...
It's a trip that we've been
talking about for a long time.
Where are you going?
Not far.
Well...
Send us a postcard...
At least.
To the people we love.
You have no idea
how much we will miss you.
We will miss you, too.
Don't look back.
Tom?
Tom?
Are you with me, Tom?
Can you email me
the Mareva file?
Alana Mareva?
Yeah, A.K.A. returnee 2155.
She was just here
doing her med eval.
It's my week
to do reports,
remember?
Diana, the 4400,
the ball of light,
it happened, right?
Should I be worried about you--
- Just tell me it happened.
- Yes, of course it happened.
What else have we been
doing here the last year?
That's great.
My god.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Alana. Alana!
Alana!
Alana, wait!
Thomas.
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world
will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
As far as
this department knew,
Maia wasn't having
visions anymore.
She was keeping them
secret from me
and writing everything
down in a diary.
It's a subpoena.
What do they want?
Your diary.
Don't reveal
your healing ability,
because if you heal
one of them,
you're going
to have to heal them all.
One day,
all of this will be yours.
The paperwork's been drawn up.
The lawyers know what to do.
Everything's in place.
He had a vision
to save the future,
and now he won't be here
to see us achieve it.
But we will achieve.
None of this
is real to me either.
This is where they altered us,
gave me the ability
to create the world
we've been living in
for the last eight years.
I love you, Thomas.
So, let me see
if I've got this, um, straight.
You two met,
fell in love,
and spent eight years
together
in some kind of...
alternate reality,
and now you're here,
with eight years of love
and marriage under your belts,
in what to us was...
no time at all.
Yeah, that...
that about sums it up.
Yeah.
I'll play along.
But if you two start
calling each other "honeybunny",
I'm so out of here.
I told you
he'd try, Thomas.
How'd you know that?
Well, you might be meeting me
for the first time,
but I know all about you.
You're smart,
your favorite writer
is Alan Moore,
and your favorite meal
is meatloaf.
But I can't be
exactly the same.
You said there was no 4400,
so that means
no coma, no time lost...
no major problems.
That's right.
You were happy.
Successful.
Meaning what?
Nothing.
We used to talk about
medical school, remember?
Over there,
you went to Stanford.
How'd I do?
You graduated
with honors.
You became
a neurologist.
Must have made you proud.
I'm always proud of you.
Right, but "Dr. Kyle Baldwin"
and that world
you were vacationing in,
it came from your mind,
right?
Actually, it was my mind.
Right,
but you created it
using his memories.
Kyle, I'm just as proud
of what
you've accomplished here.
Prouder.
Hey.
You want to know why
all lawyers are jerks?
Because they spend
a lifetime
reading this crap.
What kind of crap,
specifically?
I'm a pretty good
interpreter.
I have 24 hours
to turn Maia's diary over
to NTAC,
and not one legal option
to get out of it.
What are you going to do?
Well, what NTAC wants,
NTAC gets,
but I have a 9-year-old
daughter at home
who's counting on me
to protect her.
Any way I can help?
Yeah, you can slap me
upside the head
for ever mentioning the diary
in the first place.
It didn't save Collier's life,
and now it's making mine hell.
How about I just make
some fresh coffee instead?
Oh... thanks.
Yeah.
Do you think
they'll find
the man
who did it?
If, by "they",
you mean "Thomas",
then yeah, probably.
My dad always gets
his man.
You heading out?
Yes, I have to keep
reminding myself
I don't live here
anymore.
Look, Kyle,
your father and I
love each other.
That's great.
There's not enough love
in the world.
But I just met you.
Give me a few days
before I start
calling you "mom", okay?
You've got
one of those already.
I'll settle for being
a good friend...
and I'll keep bribing you
with meatloaf
until you give in.
Oh...
Hello, Mr. Ross.
Did you have
a good flight?
Yes. Thanks.
Now, would you like me
to show you around,
or do you want
to get some rest?
Neither.
Take me to Mr. Farrell.
Yes, sir.
Right this way.
They've
been waiting.
Three days.
Tell publicity
I'm not sure yet.
They're saying
we're past our deadline.
We have to release
this press statement.
This is supposed to be coming
from me?
I don't even understand
half of what it says.
It doesn't sound
like me, Lucy.
So change it.
You're the boss.
Oh, and legal
needs signatures now,
or no one gets paid,
including legal.
I can only do one thing
at a time.
So let's start
with the statement.
Why don't you dictate
something to me?
No press statement.
If the press wants to know
what Mr. Farrell
is thinking,
they can watch
60 minutes
along with the rest of America.
I've already booked
an exclusive interview
with our new face
of the 4400.
That's all for now.
Thanks.
I'm sorry to just jump in
like that.
I thought you could use a hand.
Matthew Ross.
Yes.
Yeah.
What are you doing
in Seattle?
I go
where I'm needed.
You've come
to the right place.
It's no coincidence, Shawn.
Jordan made it clear
that, in the event of his death,
I was to step up,
front and center,
to help you out.
Well, another in a long line
of plans
that Jordan neglected
to share with me.
Huh.
But I'm glad
you're here.
Jordan talked about you a lot...
You're going to need
to hire yourself a new lobbyist.
I'm moving to the home office
for the time being.
Pick any office you want.
You start right away.
Uh, these letters?
Everyone knows I can heal now.
Jordan had every intention
of revealing
your healing ability
to the public,
but he was planning on doing it
in stages.
We don't have
that luxury anymore.
We'll deal with it.
I can't go outside anymore.
There's sick people.
The press,
they follow me everywhere.
And they will
for the rest of your life.
The ground just shifted
under your feet.
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.
This center
is the new Lourdes.
Nobody's going to be calling us
a "cult" anymore.
We're turning away people
faster than we can sign them up.
In 10 years,
this movement's going to be
one of the dominant faiths
on the planet.
Stop.
I'm glad things are going
so well, I am,
but a week ago,
I was just some guy trying
to beat the last level of Doom.
I wasn't the pope then,
and I'm not the pope now.
Yes, you are,
and you need to start
getting used to it.
The FBI is spearheading
the hunt for the man
who killed Jordan Collier.
Oh, but we're still in the game,
and NTAC is making this collar.
I'm not having someone else
clean up our mess for us.
Then we'd better get moving.
We all know
there's an expiration date
on these manhunts.
Trail starts getting cold
after 48 hours.
I want another look at employee
sign-in sheets
for every office building
and parking garage
within a 10-block radius
of the center.
We've already cross-examined
everyone on those books.
Then we have to look
off the books.
This guy shot a public figure
in broad daylight.
There has to be an eyewitness.
And so far, Tom, the only one
who has seen this killer
is you.
Loser.
Pathetic loser.
Sweetie, whatever you do,
never, ever gamble.
It's wrong
and it's stupid.
Then why do you do it?
Because,
unlike your mommy,
your aunt April doesn't
have a steady income.
She's an artist,
and artists
always need cash,
which is where the "stupid" part
comes in,
because I always lose.
So this whole
"see the future" thing,
it doesn't just apply
to earth-shattering events, huh?
Not always.
So, if I were to ask you
which card...
that one.
I'll take this one right here.
Thanks.
Baby girl...
you are my new lucky charm.
I'm pulling you off
the Collier case.
What are you
talking about?
We still have half
that neighborhood to canvass.
It's going to have to wait.
At 10:37 a.m.,
pacific standard,
the federal emergency
management agency
sent in a task force
to Granite Pass, Oregon,
population 273,
where there's been
an outbreak
of a lethal, highly contagious,
and as yet unidentified virus.
Airborne?
Mm-hmm. Yeah, likely.
Man-made?
Unknown.
What we do know is,
if you went to sleep
in Granite Pass last night,
chances are you're filling out
a body bag this morning.
There's only
one resident
that FEMA hasn't
accounted for yet.
Jean Delynn Baker,
age 30.
Returnee 0188.
Disappeared in '99.
Divorced. No kids.
Psych profile says
she's a loner.
Things have been
pretty grim for her
since she got back.
Hasn't been able
to hold down a job.
She was unemployed
four times
in the last year.
And now she's the only resident
of Granite Pass, Oregon
who can't be
accounted for.
So we've got two possibilities.
Either she's immune
to this virus,
in which case we could
study her,
look for a cure.
Or else...
she's the carrier.
Either way,
your job is the same.
Use whatever resources you need
and find her.
So, are you
going to tell me
where you're headed?
I never could
stand the sight
of a woman in tears.
I guess that's why
I never got married.
You in some kind
of trouble?
Run off
on your family?
Law on your tail?
Seattle.
I'm going to Seattle.
That's a big city.
You want me to just drop you
on the edge of town?
I'm going to the 4400 center.
I've got to get there.
What the hell for?
Are you joining up?
Just get me as close
as you can.
Please.
If you're looking
for salvation,
you're not going
to find it there.
What you want to do
is to give yourself
over...
to your true lord
and savior.
Purification day
is coming.
Signs are everywhere...
pestilence, plagues.
Tell me about it.
I woke up in a town
full of dead people
this morning...
my mother,
my father.
Every...
everyone.
Yeah?
How come you survived?
I think maybe I caused it.
You?
Now I know you're
messing with me.
Okay, go ahead,
laugh at the Jesus freak,
but I'm telling you,
the whole world'll be
wiped clean soon enough.
Look, I don't think
you're a freak at all, mister.
Matter of fact,
I believe... everything you are saying.
The eyes and fingernails show
only slight discoloration.
Rigor mortis
has barely set in.
What did the autopsies show?
Nothing we have a name for.
Their internal
organisms
are pretty much liquefied.
This thing works fast.
So you just took
your helmet off...
you got a death wish?
This virus gets released,
goes airborne,
then dissipates
within a half-hour.
Seen enough?
Plenty.
So everyone
we're looking at
died this morning
because
they were within
the virus's
original radius?
Yeah, and if they
drove through town
an hour later,
they'd be fine.
That's something,
anyway,
but Orson Bailey,
Trent Appelbaum...
when a 4400
manifests an ability,
it can get more intense,
quickly.
Which means that
if Jean Delynn Baker
is transmitting
the virus...
Yeah, she might be
just warming up.
The doctors say
they cannot stop
my cancer from spreading.
... and I've worked
hard all my life,
but tuberculosis has
eaten up our life's savings,
and my beloved wife
of four years can barely...
Grandma
told me to pray,
so when I saw you
on tv,
I knew
that you would...
Help me.
Please.
Shawn?
It's Lucy.
You're scheduled
for the new keys
address.
Everybody's waiting.
Shawn?
Yeah, I'm flattered.
I'm just not sure
I can take a job
right now.
Richard's going to be
travelling quite a bit.
The daycare here is first-rate
and completely free.
Well, for one thing,
I'm not sure I'm qualified.
I mean, assistant director
of human resources?
I had my first daughter
right out of college.
You could fit my entire resume
on half a page.
You're a 4400.
That's like an advanced
graduate degree around here.
Besides,
Jordan talked about you.
Oh, I'm sure he did.
He said you had
the gift of empathy,
that you were
a natural born organizer,
and that you had a knack
for bringing out
the best in people.
Jordan said that about me?
You're a returnee.
You're smart.
We empower people like you
around here.
Wipe your feet.
A killer airborne virus
has been released,
and you're worried
about muddy footprints?
It's still
somebody's home.
So this is where
Jean Delynn Baker lived.
Until she hit
the road, yeah.
Does she keep a schedule?
Any kind of daily planner?
Yeah, but I think
it went out the window
when she realized
her entire hometown
had been wiped out.
Anyone get in touch
with the parents?
This
is their house.
They were sleeping
upstairs
when the virus hit.
Okay, you guys
aren't leaving this house
until you've been through
everything...
letters, phone bills,
grocery lists.
Marco, listen to me.
Find me a pattern,
the way she thinks.
She's on the run.
I want to beat her
to wherever she's headed.
Flirt.
You heard the man.
4400 center.
How may I direct your call?
I didn't mean
to do it.
I didn't mean to kill them.
I...
these... these blisters,
they itch so bad.
Killed who?
I need you
to help me, please.
Who is this?
I'm a 4400,
and there's something wrong
with me.
Everybody
that I'm around dies,
and I don't know
how to stop it.
I don't know
how to stop it.
Tell me your name
and where you are.
How many
people dead?
She said hundreds,
but there's nothing about it
on the news.
Could be
they're trying to keep it quiet,
and there is a 4400
named Jean Baker?
She said
she's staying
at a motel near
the Squirrel Hill exit
on the 65.
Get me NTAC on the phone.
Yes!
You were right.
Philadelphia creamed 'em.
How much
did you win?
$200 for aunt April.
All because of you,
my little genius.
Now, I'm looking
at Chicago versus New York,
even up.
Chicago's the home team,
which gives them some advantage,
but New York
is coming off
a three-game
winning streak.
So, who's your pick?
How much are you betting?
The whole
200 bucks,
which won't win me
enough to retire on,
but a girl's got
to start somewhere.
So, you getting
anything?
Do you like me?
What kind of question is that?
I mean,
like me for myself...
or because I tell you stuff
that's going to happen?
Honey, listen.
I love you
for who you are,
not what you can do.
Always.
Okay?
I'd go with Chicago.
Chicago it is.
Now, come on.
Aunt April is going
to take you out for pizza.
Go wash up,
and take your mom's stuff off.
You know she gets
kind of uptight about...
Maia.
This is my mother's
engagement ring.
Where did you get this?
I always play with it.
This is a very valuable ring,
which means
it is not
for little girls
to play with.
Now wash good,
or I'll order anchovies.
Go!
Hey.
Hey.
Don't take this the wrong way,
but how'd you get in here?
Your dad gave me a key.
A little early
for dinner, isn't it?
Early for eating.
Not for preparing.
Can you cook?
Sorry, I'm a world-class
brain surgeon,
not a chef.
But I can empty
a grocery bag
with the best
of them, though.
But I have
to warn you,
you're ignoring
the number-one
"rule of dad".
Which is?
The longer and more carefully
you prepare for a family event...
the more likely it is
he won't show.
I guess you do know the man.
Which means I guess
you also know me,
which, I'm sorry,
is really weird.
You have to admit
it's a little strange
for me, too.
We have an eight-year
relationship,
and I have to
keep reminding myself
that it doesn't really exist.
So tell me,
was I, like, number one
in my class in medical school?
What does it matter, Kyle?
You're not in competition
with yourself.
I'm just curious.
Well, you keep bringing it up.
It's more than curiosity.
So what if it is?
If you knew there was
some parallel universe
where a better, smarter version
of you was walking around,
how would you feel?
He wasn't better,
and he wasn't smarter.
He was you.
He just had options
I'll never have.
No 4400,
no coma.
He got to go to medical school.
Who says
you don't have that option?
I'm 21.
I'm a freshman in college.
So you started a little late.
You keep thinking
I know two Kyles.
I don't. I just know you.
You want
to be a doctor?
I know for a fact
that you can pass your MCATs.
Jean Baker's in a motel
about 10 miles ahead.
Right now, half of NTAC
is headed for that place.
Mortimer and Falcone
should be there already.
It's weird, huh?
Responding to a tip
that came from inside
the 4400 center?
Shawn did tell me
he wanted
to cooperate with us.
I guess he meant it.
Excuse me. We're NTAC.
We need to get through here.
I'll open it for you.
So what's going on
down there?
Dead trucker.
Looks like
it came on sudden.
Jean Delynn Baker?
No, no, no.
What are you doing?
I called you for help.
We know.
Come with us.
No, you're scaring me.
Please, stop.
They start to itch
when I get scared.
Please, get away from me!
Oh, god.
That trucker died
not more than
three hours ago.
Yeah, and he couldn't
have picked up Jean
more than two hours
before that.
Which means
he was exposed, infected,
and killed within,
what, 120 minutes.
That's faster
than any virus
I've ever seen.
Mortimer and Falcone.
Looks like
we're playing backup.
Baldwin.
It's not my fault.
Who is this?
I called you for help.
You tossed tear gas
into my room!
Jean Baker?
How did you get
Mortimer's phone?
How do you think I got it?
They scared me.
They... they came barging in
to my room.
What did you do
to them?
I guess you thought
those suits they had on
would keep them safe, huh?
Well, you were wrong, okay?
Nobody's safe.
That's why I'm warning you.
You stay away from me, okay.
Just keep everyone away.
Where are you?
I'm driving.
I think
she took their car.
Call Jarvis.
Get a bead on it.
Jean, tell me
where you are,
where you're going.
We want to help you.
No. I tried that.
No one can help me.
No one ever could.
Why should it be
any different now?
I know you don't want
to kill anyone,
but listen to me,
this virus that's
growing inside you,
it's incredibly lethal.
I've always been toxic.
I poisoned every relationship
I ever had.
This is different.
Yes, they made it real.
My parents always said
I was a walking disaster.
They never got to see
how right they were.
Jean, it doesn't have
to be like that.
If you want this
to be over,
it can be.
Just find a deserted
spot, pull over,
and wait for us
to come to you.
I don't need you.
I'm taking care of it myself.
What are you
going to do?
I'm going to end this
before I kill anyone else.
End what?
This phone call, this day,
everything.
No, Jean, just wait.
Hold on. Listen to me.
Goodbye, Baldwin.
She says she's going
to kill herself.
Well, I'm not sure
that's a solution.
It could trigger
another release of the virus.
Do we have a fix on her?
Yeah, she's driving west
on the 99.
Jarvis has got three
helicopters in the air.
If she doesn't pull over,
there's orders
to incinerate.
Vacation?
For how long?
A month, maybe two.
I don't know.
You think that's what
the center, the movement,
needs right now?
I don't know, Matthew,
but I'm damn sure
it's what I need
right now.
I think you're going
to have to settle
for a long weekend.
I hear puget sound
is nice.
Okay, you're not hearing me.
I'm ignoring you.
There's a difference.
Listen.
I'm not saying
I can't do this.
I will lead this movement.
But Jordan just died,
and I need some time
to get my head around that.
You're going to have to grieve
on the run
like the rest of us.
It's called being a grownup.
Don't lecture me
about my responsibilities.
You just got here,
and if this place needs me
the way that you keep
saying that it does,
then it's going to have
to work around me sometimes.
Work around you?
We can do that.
Mary O'Connell.
Taken 1972.
Very promising empath.
Robert Fields, 1987.
Genius with numbers
and pattern recognition.
John Gersten...
Who are these people?
Replacements, potentially.
None of them make
the slam dunk you would,
but I'm ready
to move this center forward,
with you or otherwise.
Jordan used to talk to me
that way sometimes.
He was great at getting me
to see things his way.
You?
You're not quite there yet.
Your healing power
makes you unique.
Jordan knew it.
I believed it.
I came here to work with you,
but you're asking me
to work around you,
and that I can't do.
Then you are going
to have to spend
some quality time
with that list,
because I'm leaving.
I'm sure you won't
miss a beat, though.
I know there's a huge demand
for pattern recognition.
Th-th-that's impossible.
Mortimer and Falcone
were wearing
state-of-the-art
biohazard gear.
That stuff's engineered
to withstand an anthrax attack.
They're dead, Marco.
Obviously, whatever
she's releasing
is a little craftier
than the anthrax virus.
If it got through those suits,
that means the antigen's
operating on a subatomic level.
Which basically
makes it unstoppable.
Yeah, pretty much.
Jean told me Mortimer
and Falcone scared her
when they came
into her room.
Is it possible
the release of this virus
is connected
to her emotional state?
Yeah, more than possible,
it's likely.
Her medicine cabinet
is basically a neon sign
flashing "borderline
personality disorder".
She's got cortisone creams
for stress rashes,
an assortment
of your finer
psychopharmaceuticals...
Xanax, Prozac...
Yeah, we get it, Marco.
She's a wreck.
A wreck whose body acts
as a delivery system
for the virus she's producing...
the same way
flowers release pollen.
What, she's emitting
spores?
Something like that.
Look, spores are just
reproductive bodies
released by a vascular system.
The human body
is one big vascular system.
It runs on blood flow.
Yeah, which can
speed up or slow down,
depending on moods,
feelings.
Right, so when Jean's blood
gets going...
when she's angry,
confused, upset, whatever...
a killer virus goes airborne.
We're not far
from her car now, Marco.
Any advice on how
to deal with her?
Uh... don't piss her off?
Hey.
Hi.
How are you, Lily?
Good.
I heard, um,
you're leaving for a while.
That was fast.
Anyway, yeah, I don't know
how long I'm going to be gone.
What are you going to do?
For starters, I'm going to
disappear for a while,
and then, um, I don't know,
who knows?
I mean, I don't have
to work here
to make people healthy,
so I guess I could go anywhere.
So you're just
going to kind of roam the earth...
... "Kung Fu" style?
I'm not going to shave my head
and wear a robe,
but... something like that,
I guess.
Well, you could take these
with you,
check out
the return address...
stop off
in Gloucester, Massachusetts,
do a quick healing,
and then go on your way.
You know about the letters?
Oh, Shawn,
they're everywhere.
Yeah, each one sadder
than the next.
It's too much to take, almost.
It did give me
an idea, though,
but, you know, you're leaving,
so we'll talk it over
when you get back.
No, Lily, I mean...
... like I said, I don't know when
that's going to be, so, please,
I would love to hear
what you have to say.
All right, well,
I was thinking...
I mean, we're not
a hospital,
and we're not
a charity,
and still, thousands
of these requests
keep pouring in
every day.
I mean, no wonder
you feel overwhelmed.
We're not set up
to handle it.
Yes, exactly.
That's why
I've got to get out of here.
What if we set up a foundation?
Part of this place,
but separate.
Hire a staff
whose only job
is to open
these letters
and find the neediest cases,
people that we can help
that no one else can.
But that is still saying no
to thousands of people.
Well, that's right, Shawn,
but what if we can say yes
to one?
I mean, you heal
one person a day,
every day.
That's a big job, though...
deciding who deserves it most.
Well, so you form a committee,
and you load it up
with doctors and social workers.
And you.
Oh. Well...
come on, I mean,
it's your idea.
You should at least be there
to help make it happen.
Yeah, I just took a job
at human resources.
I think I could probably
get you transferred.
Did you find a body
in there?
Can't get
close enough yet.
As soon as you can,
we need to retrieve it.
Well, she said
she wanted to end it.
I guess we could send
Marco and his boys
back down
to the basement,
let 'em find
a ripple effect
on this one.
Excuse me.
Baldwin.
I came close,
but I don't know...
Jean?
I couldn't go through with it.
That's good.
Nobody wants you dead.
Just tell me where you are.
No. You can't
help me.
The 4400 center can't help me,
but it doesn't matter.
I finally know
where I'm supposed to go.
Tell me where.
I'll meet you
there.
You ever read
the Bible, Baldwin?
I went to sunday school.
I spent some time
with it earlier today,
back at that motel.
"The time is at hand".
That's "Revelations", right?
But do you know
what it means?
I bet you don't.
See, these blisters...
they form on my hands.
Do you get it?
I'm not sure I do, Jean.
They're talking
about me in that book.
You got family?
Jean, what are you
talking about?
Go to them.
Hug them real tight.
I've finally
figured it out,
why they
sent me back.
I'm part of their plan.
They want me to do this.
Do what?
Purify humanity.
She was quoting "Revelations?"
Never a good sign, Tom.
She's gone
from wanting to help,
wanting to stop
all of this,
to believing she's
the end of the world,
so what does she do?
She said they want her
to do this, right?
Well, that implies
it's out of her hands.
Destiny.
She's giving up
responsibility.
Yeah, that's one way
to deal with being
a walking plague...
pretend the decision's
out of your hands.
I don't think
she wants to even
think about it
anymore.
I think she just
wants it over.
Well,
that's her mindset.
It still doesn't tell us
where she's going.
She's on autopilot, Tom.
My best guess?
She does whatever
she planned on doing
before the bodies
started rolling.
Right.
Marco.
Today's tuesday, right?
It's wednesday, Marco.
My bad.
She's only got one thing
written down for the day.
She's filing
her unemployment claim
in downtown Portland.
Son of a bitch!
I don't believe it.
Am I dreaming,
or did you not tell me
that Chicago would win?
Do you know
what I bet?
$200.
Try my mother's
diamond engagement ring,
and now it's gone,
all because I believed in you,
trusted you,
and you let me down.
You lied to me.
You said winning
didn't matter.
You said you liked me anyway.
Oh, so you knew Chicago
would lose, didn't you?
Right from the jump,
this was all just a test.
A foundation?
Don't you think
we have our hands
full already?
It's one person a day.
Once it's up
and running,
it's not really going
to eat into my time.
I thought you were
looking for privacy.
You do this,
you're stepping into
a white-hot spotlight.
Yes, but it's
on my terms.
Be good publicity.
Not too hard
to get off the ground.
We could get
some huge names
for that
filtering committee.
I think
it's a good idea.
Well, I'm glad
that you approve,
but I wasn't really asking
for your permission.
I would hope not.
Jean.
Baldwin?
That's right.
You should've stayed away.
Look around you.
All these people, they haven't
done anything to hurt you.
They haven't done anything
to help me, either.
Besides,
it doesn't matter.
I don't have a choice.
I am doing
what they wanted me to do.
You don't have
to accept that.
You have a choice.
Yeah, like I had a choice
when I was abducted.
I never had a choice.
Ever.
They have
the right girl
for the job.
What are you doing
here, anyway?
You should have gone
back to your family,
like I said.
No. I'm right where
I want to be.
Then you must have
some kind of death wish.
You think you're here
to kill people.
I think I'm here to stop you.
They infected you, Jean,
and that was wrong,
but you don't have to let them
make you into a mass murderer.
I'm already a killer.
No. No.
You haven't decided
to kill anyone.
That's what you're doing
right now.
Whatever
you're thinking
about destiny or fate,
whatever...
you're wrong.
You don't have to do this.
You don't.
Want to hear
something funny?
I... I believe you.
But it's too late.
Oh...
they're so ripe.
I can't stop it now.
They itch so bad.
They do.
Hell of a day.
How are you holding up?
Well...
I'm scheduled
for psychiatric
counseling on monday.
Saved thousands
of innocent people,
had to shoot a woman
to do it...
you did what you had to do.
Anyway, uh,
not sure if this
is a good time,
but I made you
a little something.
It's kind of a...
well, a fake version
of Maia's diary.
Should fool
just about anybody.
You forged this
to get NTAC off my back?
I know
it's a big thing,
but you were kind of
over a barrel, so...
this could get me
into a lot of trouble.
This could get you
in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, uh...
you don't
have to use it
if you don't want to.
Just giving you
an option.
This is insane.
It's also maybe one
of the nicest things
anybody's ever done
for me.
I want to thank you
for a job well done.
You must have been
very persuasive.
I just said what I thought.
Your idea for a foundation
was terrific.
You mean your idea, don't you?
Do we have to be
all cloak-and-dagger
about it?
You and Shawn
both got what you wanted,
and a lot of sick people
are going to get help.
Well, you did a lot of good
for the center today,
and I'm not going to forget it.
Hey, Matthew,
you know what the center
means to me?
What?
Free rent and daycare
for my daughter.
I'm not
an 18-year-old kid.
I don't need to discover
the magic power inside of me.
So, in other words...
you're not a true believer?
Is that a problem?
Not at all.
Neither am I.
You look wiped.
Yeah. Don't ask.
You didn't
have to do this.
Well, I didn't.
Your son's the cook.
Kyle?
I bet he had
a little help.
Well, you know,
we got to talking.
It was nice.
How was your day, Alana?
Well, I bought
these pieces
from this young artist,
this girl from Bed-stuy,
self-taught,
and she painted
this little
scrap of garden
in her backyard,
and it's night,
and the sky
is so rich and deep...
You okay?
More or less.
Bet you almost forgot.
No, I didn't,
but I thought,
in light of today's events,
I would give you
a little extension.
Well, it's not necessary.
It's a hot read.
Lots of good stuff
about Spongebob.
Thank you.
the national
threat assessment command
has been working closely
with state
and local law enforcement
in the Jordan Collier
murder investigation...
Though there have been
no arrests made
as of yet,
NTAC claims
that progress is being made...
Federal officials did say
that the investigation
is headed
in a positive direction
and are confident
that it will lead to an arr...
We are not a threat.
We are salvation.
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400...
Remember me?
Nikki?
You're the only good thing that's
happened to me since I've been back.
Dan-- oh!
Danny!
Danny!
Stop blaming me for Nikki!
Shawn, stop it.
You're killing him!
So this whole "see the future" thing.
it doesn't just apply to
earth-shattering events, huh?
Not always.
That one.
Baby girl, you are my new lucky charm.
Do you know what I bet?
Try my mother's diamond engagement ring.
and now it's gone.
You said winning didn't matter.
You said you liked me.
This was all just a test...
and you failed.
This doesn't sound like me, Lucy.
So change it.
You're the boss.
Matthew Ross.
Yes.
Jordan made it clear that
in the event of his death.
I was to step up front and center to help you out.
The ground just shifted under your feet.
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.
The fact is that everyone
alive today owes Jordan Collier.
He had a vision to save the future.
You were waiting in the hallway
outside my apartment last night.
I don't know how I got there.
Please, believe me.
I had another blackout last night.
Kyle?
Kyle!
Yeah, I'm in here.
Hold on a sec.
It's 10 after 8:00.
You taking the day off?
I guess my alarm didn't go off.
You'd better get moving.
Your first class is at 9:00 on tuesdays, right?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Want me to get you some smelling salts?
Come on, buddy, it's time to roll.
Let's go.
Alana called last night.
I forgot to tell you.
She's in Barcelona, Kyle.
There's only like a 20-minute
window when we're both awake.
Any message?
Yeah, she... she, uh...
she bought a couple of paintings for her gallery.
and she misses you.
- Next time she calls and I'm not here...
- Yeah...
... yeah, I'll try to remember.
I've got to get ready, okay?
Right, well, I can't wait.
You're going to have to grab the bus.
and don't leave your towel
on the bathroom floor again, okay?
Ben?
Tyler?
My god. You haven't changed.
50-year vacation will do that for you.
You look...
I look old. Especially next to you.
I had you beat by eight months.
Last time I saw you was...
... in a tent, outside of Sinanju, Korea.
May 11th, 1951.
You remember the date.
Sometimes I have trouble
remembering my grandkid's birthday.
but that's a day that I'll never forget it.
I mean, Lee hit you,
and you, uh...
I don't know, you disappeared.
So, what are you doing here, Ben?
You remember Milton Weinberg,
your old wingman?
Milt was the first guy who invited me over
to sit at his table in the officers' mess.
He passed on.
Parkinson's disease.
I'm sorry. I knew you guys were close.
And I'm sure he would
want you at the funeral.
Is, uh...
Lee going to be there?
We treated you as an equal.
but that wasn't good enough for you.
You had to cross the line.
None of us has spoken to Lee in years.
I'll be there...
out of respect for Milt.
Is he okay?
Better than okay.
Heart rate, respiration, reflexes...
all above average.
Say hello to your healthy child.
Edwin, I...
I can't even find the words.
We don't know how to thank you.
And he's going to know all about you.
the nurse who changed his life.
Enjoy your son, Mr. and Mrs. Ward.
Keep him safe.
Edwin.
Do you have a second?
I'm sorry, doctor.
I'm due in the nursery.
It can wait.
I want to know what
you did to the ward baby.
We did amnio in the first trimester.
That baby was diagnosed
with Prader-Willi syndrome.
Perhaps there was some mistake in the tests.
You saw those results, Edwin.
The 15th chromosome was damaged.
That indicates severe
mental retardation at birth.
but their kid just scored
nine on the Apgar test.
A miracle is traditionally cause
for celebration, not an inquisition.
This is the fourth time this
has happened in the last six months.
In every one of those cases,
Edwin, you are the attending nurse.
And you're one of the 4400.
I'm not sure I see the connection.
Everyone's read about that
kid who's running the 4400 center now.
They say he's cured diseases like A.L.S.
Diseases no hospital in
the world can put a dent in.
He's a healer.
So are you.
For me, it only works in utero.
I can feel the damage
to their chromosomes.
I'm not sure exactly how it works, but,
somehow, I'm able to repair them.
That's incredible.
Dr. Hodler,
if it's all the same to you.
I'd prefer to work anonymously.
There are already rumors in
this hospital of miracle births, Edwin.
and people talk.
I don't think you're
going to have that option.
So long ago.
another life
I can feel your heart beat
it's not a dream remember us
I can see it in your eyes
we'll find our place in time
our place in time beyond the sun
we'll find our place in time
our place in time to call our own
Wait a minute.
It's Gavin Maar, I've read statement yesterday.
Why are they sending us these again?
Maybe we missed something.
There were a thousand people at
the party where Collier got assassinated.
Wouldn't you think that they could at least
send us a new set of completely useless files?
Any hot leads in there?
I didn't think so.
I'm pulling you off the Collier case,
just for the moment.
Something important, I hope.
One of the files in the morning
research report caught my eye.
There's an internet chat
room for pregnant women.
Yesterday, someone
started a thread about some
unexplained reversals of
birth defects at Mercy hospital.
So you're yanking us off Collier
to check out internet chatter?
There's a 4400 who works at the hospital.
Bingo.
Edwin Mayuya.
He was born in Rwanda.
So this guy's some kind of healer?
According to the internet.
Don't worry, you're still the alpha dog.
It's not like I mind.
It's great if he is, of course.
We should invite him to the center.
At the very least,
I think Mr. Mayuya merits a sitdown.
All right, set it up.
I'll be there.
Why don't you let me
handle the meet and greet?
I'll figure out if there's
anything to these stories.
In the meantime,
there's a move I'd like
you to consider making.
Call it the next phase in
your development as a leader.
Matthew, I told you,
I will read the art of war, okay?
I want you to call your mom.
I know Jordan counseled you
to distance yourself from your family.
Before Jordan was telling me anything,
my family had already distanced themselves from me.
Family dynamics are complex.
I don't think that a phone call
is going to lead straight into some kind of group hug.
Even if it leads to just dinner,
you're heading in the right direction.
But, Matthew
what is it to you?
Right now, every news desk in the country
is taking a long, hard look at you.
They're looking for a weakness.
And because I'm not speaking to my family,
that implies what?
Everybody here is supposed to do likewise?
The press will spin it that way.
That's how they smear us with the "cult" label.
You want me to stir up all of this old business
as a publicity ploy?
You can take care of it now, or wait
and see it splashed all over the newspapers.
Here's your mom's phone number.
In case you forgot...
Comes in and says,
"How do you think I rang the bell?"
We were just saying what a nice
ceremony this was. Old Milt...
... he left a great family behind.
He had a lot of love to spread around.
We thought you got killed,
or captured, maybe.
There was some talk you went AWOL.
None of us put any stock in that.
Disappearing in a beam of light--
nobody thought of that, huh?
Hey, uh, you in town tonight?
Oh, good. We're going to have our own
private wake for Milt down at Chauncey's.
You know he loved his bud,
so we're going to hoist a few in his memory.
You should come.
We'll kick around old times.
"Old times" was hardly more than a year ago for me.
You can fill in the gaps, then.
There's a lot of stuff we don't remember anymore.
Chance to swap tall tales with you old duffers?
Wouldn't miss it.
NTAC has examined me several times already this year.
I don't think I'm due for another for?
three months, I believe.
You've never missed an appointment.
We appreciate that.
You just admitted to us that you've developed this ability.
It's a kind of earth-shaking one, I have to say.
Forgive me,
but I don't see how submitting
to another round of tests helps anyone.
These mutations you can induce--
I believe they are not mutations, sir.
I believe they are repairs.
Either way, our doctors need to take a look at you.
If they can figure out the way your ability works,
it could help a lot of people.
All right, then.
I will let your doctors poke and prod me to their hearts' content.
But I ask one thing--
that you allow me my privacy.
I do not want to become a public figure.
Well, that works for us.
I mean, whenever a new ability leaks to the press--
good, bad, or whatever--
it stirs a lot of people up.
Precisely what I hope to avoid.
I've seen firsthand the type of behavior
that irrational fears can provoke.
You left Rwanda in April of 1994.
That was the beginning of the Tutsis' genocide.
The beginning?
Believe me, I saw my fill of horrors
during those two weeks.
If I hadn't been granted asylum here in America,
I'd be dead.
You were probably just getting used
to the place when you got abducted, I'm sure.
There were nights in Kigali
when I would have welcomed the chance
to disappear from the face of this earth.
So, uh, just let me get this straight--
you used Maia's predictions so that you could gamble?
I didn't use her to gamble.
I used her to win.
You mean that you used her to cheat.
You exploited a nine-year-old girl who loves you.
She was having a good time.
We both were.
But only one of you is an adult.
I can't believe that you're standing there defending it.
Well, this part of it,
I can kind of mount a credible defense.
What, so you haven't got to the part
that you're ashamed of yet?
These bets?
they were sure things?
but I needed money to make them.
You know mom's engagement ring?
You mean the one that she left to me?
The one I should have worn to my wedding.
I pawned it.
I just can't believe that I let Maia anywhere near you.
I want you out of here.
Lucy.
If I watch the news tonight,
am I going to be a happy man?
The stations I called all seemed very interested.
A 4400 who cures birth defects?
I'd cover it.
I suppose the tip was anonymous?
Believe me, I didn't want to leave my name.
The center outing a 4400 to the media?
Seems wrong somehow.
Well, it's not business as usual, I grant you,
but we leak it, we control the story,
and it beats letting him rot in the basement at NTAC.
Did Shawn go upstairs for the night?
He went out.
Personal business, he said.
Good night, Lucy.
Who is it?
Hello?
Mom, are you going to, uh,
are you going to open the door,
or should I use my key?
Shawn!
I would've-- I would've called ahead, but I?
Surprise.
Will the 4400 prove to be the cure for all human disease?
That's the question on everyone's lips,
as it appears a member of the 4400
has manifested the ability to reverse certain genetic birth defects in utero.
Anonymous sources claim that Edwin Mayuya...
... a 38-year-old nurse at Mercy hospital...
Murderer!
... responsible for a series of miraculous healings...
Murderer!
... over the past five months.
Murderer!
Murderer!
But if these claims prove true...
That's the man,
the one who killed your parents!
There's more.
I'm bouncing around in the shotgun seat,
and Tyler here has got the gas
pedal all the way through the floor?
Hey, we had 200 bucks on that race?
and Davis is 30 feet behind me.
and I can barely hear him screaming--
not that way.
That's where the landmines are.
If I knew he was serious.
maybe I would have paid attention.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, no one was going to follow us that way.
so we came in two minutes before the pack.
and we split the money.
We bought like five kegs of
Budweiser for the officers' club.
Get a load of this.
Looks just like it did back in the day.
Like you, Tyler.
Hard to believe-- 50 years go by,
we got the same guys,
and the same beer.
It's great to see you guys.
It's a shame it took Milt
dying to make it happen.
It's hard to find excuses
to get the whole gang together.
It's not exactly the whole gang, is it?
There's always Lee.
Which one of you guys
is going to tell me where he is?
Come on does it matter?
Matters to me.
Well, last I heard, he was in
a V. A. hospital outside of Bakersfield.
In bad shape for a long time.
Look, everyone here feels
terrible about what we did to you.
Huh? Isn't that enough?
You're not going to get
anything out of talking to Lee...
Do yourself a favor-- just let it go.
I don't give a damn.
I don't care if he?
What's up?
You know your miracle healer?
Turns out his real name is Edwin Musinga.
All his papers have been forged.
He's been wanted by the
Rwandan government since 1995.
Wanted for what?
Atrocities.
He was a doctor during the uprising.
He's killed a whole bunch of people.
I was a pediatrician at a clinic in Kigali.
I am a Hutu,
but most of my patients were Tutsi.
Many of my friends as well.
That called my loyalty into
question when the killings began.
Some men from the military came to my clinic.
and they said they wanted
to broadcast it as a safehouse.
a place Tutsi could come
to be safe from the slaughter.
And they came?
By 3:00, the clinic was full.
Every room, every corridor.
all filled with frightened Tutsi
looking to me as their protector.
The same soldiers came back
with militia at their side.
It was a setup.
Did you at least try to stop them?
The radio reports were claiming
the Tutsis had killed our president.
The anger spread like virus.
I got infected, too.
So basically, you stood by and did nothing?
All over the city, it was organized murder.
We never would have made it to safety.
You could have tried.
Easy, Tom.
Let the man finish his story.
Yes, I could have tried.
That's true, I know that now.
They made me watch.
They killed them all.
I allowed them to turn
my clinic into a slaughterhouse.
But you didn't murder anyone personally.
True.
but not much of a distinction.
I knew what was going to happen.
I let it take place.
I'm guilty.
My wife left me.
I have not seen her or my children since.
Perhaps they will come to my execution.
Your government's pushing for extradition.
You should be on a plane right now.
But your ability?
complicates things.
It would give me the
chance to make amends.
But I could save an infant
every day for the rest of my life.
and I'd still deserve
every one of my nightmares.
What was going on in there Tom?
Because if you were looking to shut
him down before he got his story out.
all that glaring was a
great way to go about it.
That guy should be
on his way to a tribunal.
Instead, we're serving
him lunch downstairs.
Oh, what, would you
prefer it if we starved him?
I don't believe you're defending him!
I would never defend what he did.
but I would make an
argument for what he can do now.
There's a reason the future
sent him back with this amazing ability.
But forgive me if I sound like?
I don't know, you?
No. No, not this time.
No, we're not talking about a criminal.
We're not even talking about a murderer.
We're talking about genocide, Diana!
Maybe the future doesn't
have a problem with that, but I do.
So if I don't believe that the world is
better off with a bullet in this guy's head.
I'm advocating genocide?
No.
There are people in Rwanda
right now who have lost mothers,
brothers, and children in that clinic.
And he stood by,
and he let it happen.
That's just like our government,
just like governments all over the world.
They all knew what was happening, Tom,
but nobody lifted a finger to stop it.
Yeah, and that was wrong, too...
... and so is this.
We've been working on
blind faith for a year and a half,
assuming these people
knew what they were doing.
but enough is enough.
Yeah, we're saving the future,
but we're leaving justice behind.
Is it something that you
want to be a part of, Diana?
So Shawn just shows out of nowhere,
and all of a sudden I'm supposed to drop all of my plans
and head to some peace dinner.
We both know why he's turned up now, right?
You don't have to be a shrink to piece it together...
His mentor daddy figure gets killed,
and he comes crawling back to mommy.
Danny, why don't you quit whining
about Shawn?
He's your brother,
it's been a year, let it go...
Hey, you're the guy who talked to him and
told me how brainwashed he is.
So if he's coming for dinner,
that's a good thing, right?
At least pretend it is,
for your mom's sake.
What's with the attitude, man?
I just don't want to hear you bitch anymore, okay?
I don't understand.
Why do you have to go?
Can't you just say you're sorry?
It doesn't always work that way with grown-ups.
Sometimes things gets so messed up
that "sorry" doesn't cut it.
Happens a lot when I'm involved, actually.
But if you only just leave,
nothing gets better...
Sweetie...
I'm sorry.
I used you.
It was wrong.
But I forgive you.
I still have to go.
Well, I know I cooked all day
but is my lasagna really that great?
You're both just stunned into silence?
I haven't had this stuff in,
like a year...
Good, you said something...
Danny, why don't you give it a try?
All right, you know what?
That's it, Danny,
this entire night is about you and me.
That's why mom did this...
... you know?
What do you want me to do...
... say we're all fine and dandy?
It's not that easy.
I don't expect it to be,
but you and I obviously have some stuff
we need to get into the open.
Okay, so you're going to apologize to me now,
is that it?
Or was I just imagining it when you screwed my girlfriend?
The thing with Nikki,
I wish it wouldn't have happened that way,
What about almost stopping my heart,
or whatever it is that you did?
You feel bad about that, too?
You know what?
You want to hate me forever?
You be my guest,
But you're my brother,
and I came here to make things right by you,
What do you want me to do?
You need to punch me in the face or something?I mean
be my guest
Danny, don't you dare,
Just one shot, ma.
He deserves it.
Look, he's even asking for it.
Are we okay?
Are we done?
We're letting him walk?
He's responsible for hundreds of deaths,
His degree of culpability is not for us to determine,
Okay, look, I can't ship him off to Rwanda,
Not yet, anyway,
In the meantime, his 48-hour hold is up,
and the 4400 center has hired lawyers
who are pressing for his release,
The press are all over this story,
Will he even be safe on the streets?
Yeah, a war criminal's safety,
that's my big concern,
Oh, it had better be,
In exchange for protection,
Edwin Musinga has agreed
to continue coming into our labs,
We're babysitting him?
In exchange for a chance to study what he can do,
This guy could advance genetic research by a hundred years,
It sounds like a fair trade to me,
Mm-hmm,
How long have you been feeling faint?
On and off, perhaps a month,
You should have told your doctors,
You forget, miss Skouris, I am a doctor,
I have been anemic since I was 15,
I'm certain--
You okay?
Yeah...
Stay with him, I'm going out.
Stay down, stay down, stay down...
Take these people out of here...
I want a patrol car passing by every 20 minutes...
Help!
Someone call an ambulance!
I think she's having a heart attack.
He did this to her...
Why are you protecting him?
He's a murderer!
How did this become public?
Well, I assure you,
it wasn't NTAC.
Perhaps if I had gone out and spoken to them,
this could have been avoided.
Oh, yeah, that would have calmed them down...
They could have torn you apart.
I think I have already demonstrated the lengths
I'm willing to go in order to live,
You can add another victim to your list.
That woman is dead.
Okay, Tom, why don't you just go back outside?
Take a walk around the block.
You know why she was out there?
Huh?
Because this son of a bitch
let her son, her daughter-in-law, and about
eight of her nephews and nieces die,
Huh?
Isn't that right, doctor?
Tom, stop!
Isn't that right?
Stop!
I regret her death,
same as I regret them all.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry you feel bad,
but it doesn't change anything, does it?
Tom, enough.
Let him go!
Now!
Let him go!
Look, Benjamin,
I don't see what the problem is,
Edwin Musinga never killed anybody,
not personally, anyway,
I already told you which senators to call...
Get face time if you can,
do I have to fly out there and do this myself?
I thought not.
Blackberry me when things start to tip.
Full-court press is on?
I kind of wish I was out there,
cash in a few favors,
watch the hill fall in line...
Do we really want to be cashing in favors
for this guy?
He says himself he's dirty...
Oh, he's worse than dirty,
he's practically a mass murderer...
So why are we wasting our time with him?
Somebody might come along who actually
deserves our help, Matthew...
He's a 4400,
guilty or not, he's a part of what we're doing,
they gave him that ability for a reason,
and I doubt it has anything to do
with being executed in Rwanda.
So let's say he didn't come back with an ability,
would we still be fighting the good fight on his behalf?
You're the boss,
you tell me.
Breakfast is ready.
You know you're going to start talking to me eventually, right?
I seriously doubt that you can hold out till you're 18.
She used you, Maia.
She said she was sorry.
Well, there--there still has to be consequences.
Your ability is a gift,
but it makes you a target, too,
and I have to protect you from people who want to exploit you.
Besides,
you're not the only one your aunt April hurt this week.
But I showed her the ring...
... she wouldn't even have known about it
if it weren't for me.
Well, you should never have been playing with it,
which is why you don't get any tv this week.
What your aunt did was completely different,
and she knows it.
She made a bad mistake...
Isn't that what having a family's about?
Forgiving someone when they make a bad mistake?
It doesn't matter if I forgive her,
I...
I just can't have her around you.
But we don't have such a big family...
We can't just kick someone out--
even if they mess up.
Oh, Maia,
you've got to-- do me a favor.
Stop being more grown-up than your mom.
Now, just come on.
Come on, your cereal's getting mushy.
Come on, let's go.
I am not kidding you,
it was, like, the most intense
wrist-burn I think I've ever given.
He took it like a man, I'll give him that.
After that, we ate,
we talked a little bit.
I was surprised-- it was pretty much okay.
Good to hear.
I was glad I went.
Well, you know what that makes you?
Right.
Yeah, I'm a genius.
I don't get it, Kyle.
Look, you're pissed at me when
I tell you I don't want to see Shawn,
and then I do it, and I tell you it went pretty good,
and I get a big shrug.
Nobody asked you to sit here, man.
What's going on, Kyle?
What, are you blacking out again?
Just forget it.
Look, if you don't tell me what's going on,
I'll talk to your dad.
I am not blacking out, all right?
I feel fine, you're not saying a word to my dad.
Yeah?
Then tell me why you're walking around like a zombie.
I can remember now.
Some of the things I was doing during
those blackouts, I can remember.
Like what?
I'm in trouble, that's all I can tell you.
I'm in big trouble.
Is there anything I can do?
Help yourself...
... stay away from me.
Got a cigarette?
You have emphysema.
I know I have emphysema.
What I don't have is a cigarette.
Do you know who I am?
For a second, I thought you were the angel of death.
Richard Tyler.
How was Weinberg's funeral?
Simple.
Dignified, kind of like Milt.
Never did like his politics much.
You know, after you disappeared, he blamed me.
Fought me once or twice.
Of course, he was wrong.
So what are you here for?
Going to slap me around a little bit?
Shut off my oxygen tank?
Uh...
... you don't make a very appealing target
these days, Lee.
What, then?
Looking for an apology?
When I first got back,
I used to lie awake in quarantine thinking about you.
All the things I would do to you
if I ever saw you again...
Oh...
You want vengeance.
Well,
sorry to disappoint you,
that's not going to work out either.
Time has kicked my ass worse than you ever could.
Time kicks everybody's ass, Lee.
Get you too, eventually.
Caught up with old Milt,
didn't it, for sure...
At the funeral,
those guys were tripping over
each other to say sorry.
But you've had 50 years to dwell on what you did...
I didn't like hitting a fellow officer,
but you gave me cause.
I ate beside you, I fought beside you,
but when you took up with a white woman,
you crossed the line.
That's what you said back then.
I'm saying it again now.
The world's changed, Lee, or haven't you noticed?
The world, maybe, not me.
And how's that working out for you?
I stopped by your room...
... no cards...
... no flowers...
The lady at the front desk couldn't believe you had a visitor.
You know,
I really wish you'd brought some cigarettes.
You always did stick to your habits, Lee...
... even after they started to kill you.
So long.
They're not just statistics, Diana...
... he let that happen.
I know what he did,
and I don't need you to rub my nose in it.
It's worth putting the faces to the numbers.
We've got a problem.
The state department has decided to fight extradition.
They're going to argue special circumstances.
So Edwin gets a pass?
And who knows how many kids get a shot at a normal life?
No, not as many as we'd hoped.
Our labs can't even figure out how his ability works,
forget about replicating it.
And I just got his med eval.
It turns out he's in bad shape.
Well, he told me he's anemic,
and he couldn't sleep...
No, no, it's worse than that.
This ability, every time he rearranges a fetal chromosome,
he's damaging his own.
So if he keeps healing...
It's going to kill him.
Listen, if you don't want to talk about what you did,
I'm not going to try to force you to.
But I guarantee you, whatever it is,
there's a way out of it.
That's easy to say, You don't know what it is.
So tell us.
How can we help you if we don't know what's going on?
I didn't ask for help.
In fact, I told you not to mention it to anyone, Danny.
And I'm not "anyone".
I'm your friend.
Stop saying that, okay?
I know you two mean well,
but you don't have a goddamn
clue what you're talking about.
I have to deal with this on my own.
We get it,
on your own, absolutely,
and we're going to help you do that.
I think what he's trying to say
is if you need some time to clear your head and
get away from everything so you can figure stuff out,
I can make that happen.
Come to the center with me, Kyle...
You're turning this into a recruiting drive?
That's not what I'm talking about.
You will have the space you need,
no one will bother you...
Kyle, if you ever get to the point where you
feel like you want to talk to somebody,
we have counselors,
therapists, lawyers.
It was worth a try, man...
... because whatever you're doing right now,
it's not working.
My car is outside.
You can come with me right now, if you want.
Okay.
Just let me... I got a couple of things to take care of...
... get a leave of absence from school, stuff like that.
I'll meet you there tonight.
And I'll be waiting.
Okay.
Thank you, guys.
How much time do I have left?
Well, that's difficult to say.
I mean, your genes are mutating
every time you heal a fetus...
... there's an indication of heart disease developing...
... you have spinal irregularities on your MRI...
If you keep healing, maybe a year, maybe less...
And if I stop?
Oh, well, I mean, if you stop healing,
then there's no reason for the state
department to fight the extradition.
You'll be handed back to the Rwandan government.
Who will have me tried and sentenced with all dispatch.
So...
... either choice that I make leads to my death...
Yes, that's right.
It would seem my abductors have
quite a perverse sense of humor.
I will, of course, continue to heal
for as long as my body allows...
At least then, my death will have a
purpose other than vengeance.
You'll have to be monitored by doctors from here on in.
They'll try and slow your decline,
but you really should come with us,
because we have some of the best
physicians in the world on payroll...
Miss Skouris, if you're offering me a bed at NTAC...
... I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I did not pass up one prison so I can die in another.
There is one place you could go.
NTAC medical's going to need him five days a week,
so I'll get you the schedule.
We'll make sure he's there on time, every time.
Edwin Musinga, this is Shawn Farrell.
He runs the center,
and you two have a lot in common.
Not a lot.
Just one thing.
One very important thing.
Did you tell him?
Yeah, he's going to keep healing.
Not that that surprises me...
I took him over to the 4400 center...
I think he's probably better off
there than he is at home.
How does it feel, Tom?
Some babies'll get saved,
and you'll get your pound of flesh.
You really want to know?
I asked you, didn't I?
It feels like justice...
Hi...
How'd you find me?
Sometimes it's good to have a kid who knows things.
What's in Berkeley?
A tattoo shop that likes my work.
Oh, some friends I can force myself on for a while.
Listen, Di...
I said this to Maia, but...
I'm so sorry.
Well, it's nice to hear,
but it doesn't change anything...
You are so deceitful, and you're
completely untrustworthy, and...
... well, you're not seeing Maia until
you've proven otherwise.
I wish I knew how to make things right.
Yeah, I wish I did, too.
And I do know it's going to take a long time,
but you're still my sister,
and you're the only one I've got,
and I'm, uh...
... well, I'm not giving up on you.
You bought it back from the pawn shop.
I know you always felt that
mom should have left it to you,
and tell you the truth,
I thought she only gave it to me because she...
... well, she figured that was the only way I was
ever going to get one of those things.
Hmm, that's a whole other
therapy session.
Di, I don't deserve this...
No, you don't,
but you're going to take it anyway...
One day...
Maia's going to wear that ring to her wedding...
... and I hope...
... well...
... I hope you know each other again by then.
Yeah.
Kyle?
Dad.
I had to leave.
I'm sorry.
Kyle?
Hey, it's me.
Uh, where are you, man?
It's 2:00 A.M.
You're not here yet...
Listen, just-- when you get this,
call me, or just show up...
Okay? Show up...
All right...
Yeah, I know you two mean well,
but you don't have a goddamn clue
what you're talking about.
I have to deal with this on my own.
Previously on the 4400...
I'm blacking out.
If you're losing chunks of time,
you should talk to your dad about it.
What's he going to do?
Turn me over to NTAC medical?
Let me see if I've got this straight.
You two met, fell in love, and spent eight years
together in some kind of alternative reality?
Liv, you were pretty far
gone last night.
When I O.D., it's not going
to be any big loss, right?
Maybe I can save you.
Whatever it is,
there's a way out of it.
That's easy to say.
You don't know what "it" is.
You told me everything
that happened that night, right?
Yeah.
If you need some time
to clear your head
and get away from everything
so you can figure stuff out,
I can make that happen.
Dad,
I had to leave. I'm sorry.
Look, I'm not interested in excuses.
I don't care how you do it,
who you have to lean on,
you just get him out of
lock-up and over to L.A.X.
I want him on
the next plane out.
Skouris, where's Baldwin?
He's not in yet, why?
What's going on?
L.A.P.D. is holding some piece of street garbage
who wants to see daylight again.
Says he can make the dealer
who sold the Collier murder weapon.
Who's handling
the L.A. interview?
Nobody. I'm having him shipped
up here for questioning.
This one feels good.
My partner's going to
like hearing that.
You can fill me in when
I get to the office.
Look, I know we're not ready
to pop any champagne yet, but
this witness has intel we kept out of the media,
specific details about the Collier murder weapon.
Sounds like we finally
caught a break.
Look, Diana, I really have to go.
Are you okay?
You sound a little distracted.
It's personal business.
Not your worry.
Well, any idea
what time you'll be in?
I can't really say just yet.
Look, I'll get in touch with you
as soon as I can, okay?
Okay, no problem.
Bye.
How long has this been going on?
Calm down.
No. I asked you a question.
How long?
Look, Kyle told me, like, a month ago.
Look, you remember that night?
Wha...
What night?
The night that he almost got arrested
for smashing that store window.
You mean when he got drunk?
He never said he was drunk.
You said he was drunk.
Kyle said he blacked out.
It happened a bunch of times
after that. One minute,
he'd be one place, the next thing
he knew, he was someplace else.
He never mentioned it to me.
He never said anything.
Well, he tried once,
but you wouldn't listen.
Look, you could have
come to me, Danny,
told me what was going on.
He's your cousin, your friend.
Which is why I promised him not to.
The last thing Kyle wanted was to
be thrown back into quarantine.
Danny, Kyle never came
home last night.
If you know where he is,
please, tell me.
He went to stay with Shawn
over at the 4400 center.
Great.
Uncle Tommy...
There's something else
you ought to know.
Kyle thinks he did something
during one of his blackouts.
He wouldn't tell us what it was,
but he really seemed
freaked out about it.
This is the committee
latest recommendation
37-year-old pipe fitter from Detroit.
He was diagnosed with Hodgkin's
disease four months ago.
When do we fly him in?
Two days from now.
Shawn.
Where is he?
Who? Kyle? He's not here.
Don't play games with me, Shawn.
Can you excuse us, Lucy?
Thank you.
Danny said Kyle came here.
Yeah, well, Danny needs to check his text
messages, because Kyle never showed.
You're not listening to me, Shawn.
I want my son.
You're not hearing me.
He's not here. Where do you think
I have him stashed, in the basement?
I wouldn't put it past you.
Oh, my g...
uncle Tommy!
Just because Kyle is having a rough time
does not make it my fault!
Been known to happen, Shawn.
He's not here!
he's not here.
Kyle?
Thomas.
I picked this up
in a village outside Barcelona,
and they said it was very special.
What's wrong?
Kyle never told me any of this.
At least I'm not the only one
out of the loop.
I thought the doctors said he was
fine when he left quarantine.
They did...
But he spent three years with a separate
consciousness living inside of him.
I don't think the doctors
knew what to do with that.
Have you called the police?
I can't get them involved,
not until I know what Kyle did.
What about Linda?
Well, she says she hasn't heard from him.
Promises to call if she does.
I'm sorry about all of this.
I'm just glad I'm back.
Where are you going?
Well, I'm not going
to find him sitting here.
I'll come with you.
No. Look... I'd rather you
stay here by the phone.
This way, if he calls...
You'll be here.
Okay.
I'll stay in touch.
And this guy is some
big-deal media consultant?
Oh, he's more than that.
Keith Petrick has prepped prime
ministers, members of parliament.
I'd say an interview with Sky News
merits a few hours' homework.
So he's going to tell me what? Just new and
different ways to say "we're not a cult?"
No,
he's going to teach you
to stay on message.
The British press loves
to play "gotcha".
Keith.
Matthew Ross. Thank you for coming.
This is Shawn Farrell.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Shawn.
Just one minute. Sorry.
Uncle Tommy came to see me.
Yeah. That's what I figured.
He came here, too.
What'd you tell him?
Well, the truth.
Kyle ditched us. He never showed.
Listen,
you know, he might still show up.
- You know?
- Yeah.
I'd give you the big tour, but...
Yeah. No. Things are crazy. I get it.
Wait, just wait, just wait.
Liv. Liv. Hey.
This is Danny, my brother.
- Hi.
- Hey.
This is Liv.
She's one of our first keys.
Actually, I'm second key now.
Really?
I'm impressed. Star pupil.
Hey, do you think
you could give him a tour?
You know, Shawn, you don't have to...
I want you to see the place.
Just hold on. Is that cool?
Sure. Yeah.
It's cool.
You two kids have fun.
I've got to... I have to
go back to work, so...
That's my brother,
off to heal the world.
Somebody has to.
You ready?
Yeah. I'm all yours.
I know who sold the rifle
that killed Collier.
That's a start.
Do we have a name?
Victor Rios.
R-I-O-S.
He lives at 43207
Sumac Drive.
S-U-M-A-C...
I've got it. Thank you.
I'm at Victor's place last month.
He gets all cranked up and starts
waving this cannon around
like he's the second coming
of Tony Montana.
He wants to swap it
for some of my product.
I told him I wasn't interested.
Can you describe
the weapon, Mr. Kovec?
I watched him put
that sucker together.
.50 caliber.
Never saw bullets so big.
And it had this humongous
scope on it,
like a huge neon sign
saying "can't miss".
What makes you so sure this was
the weapon that killed Collier?
Because...
... next time I saw Rios, he was bragging on
how much he scored for that piece.
This was, like...
Two days before Collier
got taken out.
I figure that's not a coincidence.
What do you think?
I ask you to give him a quick tour,
and two hours later...
She's a good guide.
Really sells this place.
Danny was expecting
shaved heads and robes.
Yeah. I didn't see
a single tambourine.
Are you disappointed?
Ah, you don't hear
me complaining.
So, hey, listen, big boss man,
you let your workers off
the farm at night?
So I invited Liv to a party,
but she's too shy to ask if it's okay.
Think of her like a missionary...
... a lot of potential recruits
out there at the Northmount campus.
Could be cool. I haven't left
the center in a while.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I'm sorry, man. You're going to have
to find yourself a different date.
Who are you, her warden?
Danny.
Listen, you guys can hang out here
as much as you want, no problem.
But a kegger,
that's an different story.
The wise and powerful
Shawn has spoken.
I hear and obey, your majesty.
I'm serious.
Since when did Shawn have
such a problem with keggers?
Since he developed
a messiah complex.
So what time's this party?
All right.
I woke up in the middle of the night and there
was Kyle, out here, crouching in the hallway.
With no idea how he got there.
That's right.
And I sent him away.
You were, uh..
you were scared.
It's understandable.
Not as scared as he was.
I told him he needed to get help, that
he should talk to you about these blackouts.
I wish he had.
We'd have worked it out.
Well, he wanted to.
Then what stopped him?
Look, Mr. Baldwin, your relationship
with your son is none of my business...
Agreed, but if you have
something to say, say it.
I'm sure Kyle loves you...
But I don't think he really trusts you.
What?
He told you that?
Pretty much.
Eggs, butter, walnuts,
cocoa powder.
Who said making
brownies was difficult?
Don't forget to preheat
the oven at 350 degrees.
Uh-oh.
Now things are getting
really complicated.
Relax.
I'm just kidding.
Yeah?
Now?
No. That shouldn't be a problem.
I just need to get a sitter first.
If there's a problem,
I'll call you back.
I'm sorry, sweetie, I've got to go
to work. I'll call Mrs. Skalka, see...
No, wait. Don't go.
Well, I have to. We can make
brownies another time.
That man...
You don't want to catch him.
What man?
The man you're chasing after.
Someone's going to get hurt.
Who?
Is it someone I work with?
I don't know.
Just don't go.
Are you worried about me?
Don't go.
Do you think I should get to
my car and head for the border?
Or ask to be assigned
to another case.
Hmm. Hand the risk
off to another agent?
It's not an option.
Have you told Tom?
No, not yet. He's been off
the case for a while.
Might be better for his health
if he stays that way.
She said someone was going to
get hurt, but she didn't say who.
I don't know.
Maia's visions
aren't usually so vague.
This time, she's had a vision
involving her mother.
Maybe she doesn't want
to see it too clearly.
You're not making me
feel any better.
Okay.
How about this?
Hmm?
Any better?
Sure.
You recognize that man,
Mrs. Rios?
He was a customer
of your husband's.
Husband?
He got me my green card
and more trouble than I need.
Why don't you ask Victor?
If you can find him.
Yeah, well, that's the problem, Mrs. Rios.
Your husband has left the country.
Now, we know he's in Puerto Rico.
You see? You know more than me.
He didn't tell you he was leaving?
I haven't seen him in two weeks.
Look, I need to get back to work.
A month ago, your husband
sold this man a weapon.
Your husband is implicated
in a murder, Mrs. Rios.
This is not a very good
thing for you.
Particularly if you value
your green card.
Why don't you just take
another look at the sketch?
I remember the beanie.
Not a regular customer.
He only stopped by once.
He was the one
who bought the big rifle.
And the handgun.
What handgun?
Uh, you know.
What do you call it? A 9 mm.
Anything else?
He was young... in his twenties.
Very quiet.
He only stayed a few minutes,
then left in a taxi.
How do you know that?
I called it for him.
Oh, we're going to
need that number.
We were in the middle
of a bio-lab practical,
Kyle stood up, said he'd be
right back, and that was it...
Bye-bye.
Didn't see him again
till the next day.
About what time did he leave?
Had to be 7:00, 8:00, tops.
He's wrong, as usual.
It was closer to 6:00.
Don't you remember?
We broke up right after Kyle ditched.
Yeah, look.
Anybody remember the date?
End of last month, wasn't it?
It was the 25th.
You sure?
Yeah. I remember when I got back to
the dorm, it was all over the news.
Jordan Collier's murder.
Baldwin.
You going to grace us
with a visit tomorrow?
Yeah, I'm hoping, but right now
it's looking doubtful.
Doubtful doesn't cut it.
We're closing in on this guy. Look,
we've got real leads, and I need you in here.
What kind of leads?
You want to know?
You get your ass into work.
Thomas, it could be anyone.
Look closer.
Tell me there isn't a resemblance.
This is insane. Why would Kyle
want to shoot Jordan Collier?
If it happened during one of the blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.
Not if the future wanted
their number one prophet dead.
So you think they were
controlling him again?
Yeah, directing his actions,
moving him around like a puppet.
Anything's possible.
Well, in that case,
he wasn't responsible.
The "body snatcher" defense? Alana,
I'm not sure the jury's going to buy it.
What the hell do
they want from Kyle?
They took four years of his life.
Isn't that enough?
They warned us
about this, remember?
They said you'd be
facing a crisis.
What, and that makes it all right?
They warned me?
I don't remember them telling me
they'd turn my son into a murderer.
There must be a reason.
Don't defend them, Alana.
Just don't! They used me...
All of us... Kyle, Shawn.
I'm fed up.
I love him too.
I know. I know you do,
Alana. Just...
I've got to find him
before NTAC does.
I've got to find him.
Stop it.
Serious business.
Your answers are going to determine
how far you would go in the center.
If that security guard comes by,
we'll both get kicked out.
Is that far enough?
Okay... question number one...
Did you have fun tonight?
Aren't you glad
we didn't listen to Shawn?
That's two questions.
- Shh.
- Oh!
You're supposed to think about your
answers, not say them out loud.
- Right.
- Rules are rules.
Okay.
What, are we done?
Question number two...
Are you ready for
the night to be over?
If your answer to question
number two is "no",
remove your goggles
and take your medicine.
Percocet.
Where'd you get these?
At the party. Your buddy had
them in the medicine cabinet.
So you stole them?
What's going on in here?
This area's closed.
Thanks so much, Mrs. Skalka.
I couldn't sleep.
Was that because of me?
Well, I'm home now, sweetie.
No worries.
You know this case
that I'm working on,
Can you tell me anything else
about what you saw?
Anything at all?
Because if you're keeping
something from me...
I told you everything.
Don't you believe me?
Of course I do.
Are you going to work tomorrow?
Well, honey, it's my job.
Can I go to sleep now?
Sure.
Here.
Linda.
Have you heard from Kyle?
No. I would've called you if I had.
I was hoping you'd heard something.
Linda, you two talk all the time.
Yeah, I don't remember any law
against it in the divorce settlement.
Listen, Linda, if you have
any idea where he is...
What, you think I'm holding
something back?
You're the one with all the secrets.
Look, you're his mother. It makes
sense you'd try to protect him.
In any way I could.
But I thought that's why he was
living with you, wasn't it?
Protecting him was
supposed to be your specialty.
You want to blame me? Fine.
Go ahead, but I've got to find Kyle now.
What if he doesn't want
you to find him?
I think he may be in trouble.
Serious trouble.
Tom, what is it?
What did he do?
At least give me a hint.
You don't want to know.
It's like I said...
You're the one
with all the secrets.
Hello?
Kyle, I just spoke to your father.
You didn't tell him where I was.
You came to me because you didn't want to
go back to NTAC. That's what you said.
Mom, I can't talk to you
about this, I told you.
Well, that's not the whole story, is it?
Mom, please.
Kyle, tell me what's going on.
Could you excuse me
for a moment?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Just don't tell me
"I told you so".
Okay, I won't, but I did.
Don't go blaming Danny for any of this.
It was all me, okay?
The night just got away from me.
I had some beers, and I...
You shouldn't be having beers, Liv.
You shouldn't be having anything.
A month ago, you were an addict.
We can quit the lecture.
I've already packed my bags.
You know, you want to quit,
I can't stop you.
But if you want to stay...
and you can promise me that nothing like this
is ever going to happen again, then please,
enjoy life as a first key.
I'm a second key.
Not anymore.
Mr. Farrell? Are you going
to be much longer?
No.
Come in.
So I've...
I've got a bunch o
new songs I've written.
Maybe I can play them
for you sometime.
Yeah. We'll see.
It's not like I know him better
than you, but we do talk.
And he told you where his
secret hiding place was?
No, but you looked
in all the obvious places,
and Kyle likes his privacy.
Maybe you do know him
better than I do.
No...
I didn't want to believe it, I kept...
I kept hoping I was wrong
about this.
Thomas, this is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold on to that.
okay...
Wait, don't turn around.
Alana,
take this, hide it in the house.
What are you going to do?
Go back to work.
All right, I want
this area secured.
Garrity, I want a warrant to have these
lockers opened and searched, ASAP.
Well...
Look who came out of retirement.
Good timing, Baldwin.
Your partner can bring you up to speed.
That is, assuming
you intend to stick around.
- I'm here.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, we do know that two days
before the assassination,
our man arrived at this station
with a bag full of firearms.
Well, he could've gone
anywhere from here.
Yes, so we're canvassing
all the metro routes,
we're talking to the baggage handlers,
ticket agents, bus drivers...
That sounds right.
Meantime, we just had
a shoeshine guy
I.D. the sketch. He claims he helped
our man make change to buy a locker.
Does he recall which locker?
He thinks it's in that
group there.
But all the people who use
these lockers in a month...
The odds are, like, 1 in, what, 10,000
we'll turn up anything useful.
Yeah, so why are
we even bothering?
You never know.
All we need is one print.
Yeah. We can only hope.
I guess.
You okay?
Maia had another vision.
Now, she says if
we catch this guy,
someone's going to get hurt.
Did she say who?
Welcome back.
Is Tom here?
Uh, no, he isn't.
You must be Alana.
I'm Linda.
I know.
That my interview?
I don't want to see it.
I know I sucked.
I wouldn't go
so far as "sucked".
But you could do
with more eye contact,
better enunciation.
But they didn't drag any unnecessary
dirt out of you, and that's something.
I was all distracted. Liv was here right
before, and we got into this thing...
Because you told that junkie
not to go out with your brother.
Ex-junkie.
I'm just trying to protect
her, that's all.
I'm sure that was part of it.
What do you think, I'm jealous of Danny?
You do realize that a relationship
with this girl is out of the question.
Matthew,
advise me all you want
about the center...
But that's where it stops.
You don't understand, Shawn.
You are the center.
Everything about you,
everything you do.
You cannot afford to have
an inappropriate relationship.
Jordan Collier was all about
inappropriate relationships.
I mean, every girl in this place
was fair game to him.
All the more reason
not to repeat his mistakes.
So what girl is worthy
of the great Shawn Farrell?
I will let you know
when you meet her.
On to more important things...
I wish I had time
to wipe that locker clean.
Kyle's prints could be all over it.
We've got to find him,
get him out of town.
Out of the country.
You didn't get anything else out of Linda?
Something she wouldn't tell me?
No, she's as scared as we are.
I felt guilty lying to her.
The less people who know
the truth, the better.
Still, I know how hopeless she feels.
Her son is missing. She needs answers,
and all she has to go on
is a three-line goodbye note.
Did you tell her about the note?
No.
She brought it up herself.
I never mentioned it to her.
Kyle...
Dad.
No, Kyle, wait!
Wait!
Goddammit!
- Stop it!
- Let go of me!
Enough!
Enough, Kyle.
Then I have been up on that roof, watching
Collier through the scope, the way the
trigger felt
when I pulled it,
and how his body
twisted before it hit the ground...
I mean, I remember all of it,
but it just feels like
somebody else's memories.
They are.
You weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.
You did not kill Jordan Collier.
I haven't had another blackout since.
You think it's over?
Let's hope so.
How long do you think
I'll be put away for?
Kyle, I am not going to let them put you
in prison for something you did not do.
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.
I just only wish
you would have
told me about these blackouts
when they first started.
You tried.
I didn't listen.
You know...
It's not a new thing, dad.
I... I know I haven't always
been there for you, Kyle, but I...
... I thought we had
a pretty good relationship.
We do. It's just,
you know, growing up with a dad who works for
the FBI, NTAC... it can be pretty intense, you know?
You mean I can be
pretty intense.
You can be scary at times.
If you don't believe me, ask mom.
I don't have to.
I believe you.
I'm sorry, dad.
Me too.
Hey, baby.
- Kyle.
- Hi.
I packed a few things for you.
Anything else you need, we'll get in Brussels.
What time is the flight?
Noon.
All right, we'd better check in at
the airport. We'll be safer there.
Okay, I emailed my friend,
and they'll meet us when we land.
They promised
to take good care of Kyle.
Say goodbye to mom for me, okay?
- Sure.
- Yeah
I promise to break
the news to her gently.
- I'll come and visit you as soon as I can, Kyle.
- That'd be good.
Okay.
- I love you.
- I love you.
All right.
- Thanks, dad.
- Yeah.
Alana...
Keep a close eye on him, okay?
I will, Thomas.
I will.
So far, we've found two ounces of hash,
some bootleg DVDs,
and three dop kits that belong to people
who shower in the terminal bathrooms.
I'm hoping we find a picture of Collier with a big fat "X"
marked through it, all covered in usable prints.
Yeah.
Is everything okay at home?
Because if you need to take care
of business, now is a good time.
I can hang with forensics
in case something turns up.
Thanks. I'll, uh...
I'll stick around here.
Skouris.
When did that happen?
No. We'll be right there.
That was Jarvis.
She just got a call from Metro West.
They arrested a suspect 40 minutes ago,
claim he's our guy.
Roy Keith Marsden.
25, unemployed.
Made threats against Collier
after his uncle joined the 4400 center.
Oh, and get this...
He owned a .50-caliber JHLP-6.
Alana?
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.
You know, if you're here to give me
grief about Liv, you can forget it.
What happened was
your screw-up, not mine.
You know,
you could've pulled me aside,
told me she had this drug problem.
I would've backed off.
So
if you're expecting me to apologize
and kiss your robe, you're wasting your time.
I didn't come here for that.
Look, I just don't want
this to become a big thing.
Ok, when we were kids
we used to fight like crazy.
Yeah. All the time.
Yeah, and then the next day, we'd blow it off.
Everything would go back to normal.
Yeah.
Simple as that.
Nothing wrong with simple.
Are you, uh, planning on standing there,
or are you going to help me out here?
With the car?
I don't wash cars anymore.
I've got people that do that for me.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah, well, I don't, so...
grab a sponge.
Oh, see, now...
I should've known
I was going to get wet.
Yeah, attaboy.
Get your hands dirty.
It's been a while, huh?
Come on.
Hey, sweetie.
Hi.
Look, I know you've
already had dinner,
but what do you say we take
another crack at those brownies?
Okay.
Great.
So how was your day?
Pretty good.
Good.
Aren't you going
to ask me about mine?
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for, and guess what.
Nobody was hurt.
So there's nothing to worry about.
It's all over.
Not yet.
Previously on the 4400...
Kevin's a genius, you know,
but he doesn't brag about it.
Kevin, did you just speak to me?
I haven't
said anything for a long time.
Try six years.
You're saying that Burkhoff
is the father of the 4400 technology.
I can think again too.
Kyle never came home last night.
Kyle said he blacked out.
You could've come to me, told me what was
going on. He's your cousin, your friend.
Kyle thinks he did something during one of
his blackouts. He seemed really freaked out about it.
If it happened during one of his blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.
I don't remember them telling me
to turn my son into a murderer.
I kept hoping
I was wrong about it.
This is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold onto that.
Kyle...
you weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.
You did not kill Jordan Collier.
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.
They just arrested
a suspect in the Collier killing.
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for. It's all over.
Not yet.
Thursday, July 28
5:37 pm
Mommy,
I'm scared.
I know, baby.
I'm scared too.
But it's going to be okay,
because mommy's here.
Okay?
Whatever's coming through that door...
I'll protect you.
Thursday, July 28
7:22 am
Ten Hours Earlier
Today is Jordan Collier's Birthday
He died on NTAC's watch
What does that mean?
What's what means?
Nothing.
Just some crank...
it's nothing.
Guess it's Jordan Collier's birthday.
The state of Washington gave him
a birthday present. Did you read this?
They're talking like
it's an open-and-shut case.
He made threats against Collier.
Two witnesses picked him out of a lineup.
But they're wrong.
Roy Marsden didn't kill Jordan Collier.
And neither did you, Kyle.
You told me he'd never see a courtroom.
They want to execute this guy.
It's not going to happen, Kyle.
No one can put him up on that roof. Any...
any public defender will have a motion to dismiss
in front of a judge by this time next week.
What if you're wrong? What if they find him guilty?
What am I supposed to do? Nothing?
Marsden has been in and out of jail since
he was 15. Theft, assault, attempted rape...
but he didn't kill anybody.
And he's not going to be convicted of it, Kyle.
I'm not going to let it happen.
Neither will I.
Kyle, it's not going to be easy, but you're going
to have to start putting all this behind you.
It's your first day back at school,
and I want you focused
and fierce,
and thinking about As.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Sweetie...
Mrs. Benke's going to be here
any minute. It's time to get up.
I don't feel good.
You've got a real fever, young lady.
Hey,
how long have you had that?
Dishonest? No, no, no.
I don't think we're being dishonest at all.
Human beings use less than
20% of their brain capacity.
Everything else is just...
collecting cobwebs.
Here at the 4400 center,
we're trying to tap into
that unused potential.
So your own ability, you believe it
stems from increased brainpower?
Show me another explanation.
Look, whether you believe that
we were taken to the future or not,
somebody did change us,
and they used technology to do it.
We're just trying to figure out
how and share it.
But "first keys", "second keys",
"unlocking the ability inside you"...
you have to admit that the terminology
is more religious than scientific.
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.
It's a potent combination.
So what time was
your appointment for?
They told me 11:15...
but they always tell me 11:15.
I never get in before 12:00, 12:30.
Hey, free health care, right?
So what if they're so slow?
Compulsory free health care.
You don't show up for a quarterly checkup,
you've got the goon squad knocking at your door.
You don't like it?
Don't show.
Doubt they'd slap the cuffs
on someone's grandma.
Does it itch at all?
Here.
103.1.
No wonder you wanted
to stay in bed.
Is it some kind of flu?
Most likely.
Is it okay if we keep her
here for a few hours?
I want to go home.
I know you do, honey, but dr. Hudson
is going to take very good care of you,
and I'll look in on you as often as I can.
I wish I brought Lemon.
That's her stuffed dog.
Let me guess.
He's yellow.
Yeah. Well, I could go
back and get him.
You have a very nice mommy.
I try.
About this rash...
... now, I worked at the C.D.C. for seven years,
and I never saw anything like it.
It's kind of a weird shape, huh?
Yeah.
Don't read too much into it.
It could still be
hives... an allergic reaction.
We'll take care of it.
Sweetie, you'll be okay here...
... if I go get Lemon?
Okay, my darling.
Bye, darling.
When daddy's away, he misses Isabelle so much.
But traveling around the country,
talking to all sorts of people,
clueing them in about my life...
it's kind of fun.
Shawn's amazing.
This woman comes in.
Her C.A.T. scan says she's got
a brain tumor the size of a walnut.
20 minutes later, she's on
her way. Good as new.
Hmm.
I'll feed her.
She's not hungry yet.
How do you know?
She told me before you came in.
So she's...
... talking to me.
Communicating.
Same as she does with you.
- Since when?
- This morning.
I thought you'd be happy.
First time she ever said anything to me.
That's great.
It's just...
she hasn't said anything
to me for weeks.
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's just how you used to tell me...
kids always alternate
between parents. It's normal...
Just with Isabelle,
it comes with a twist.
This is major Charles Culp of the National
Security Agency's field enforcement divisi¾n.
D.C. has loaned us his services.
Effective immediately, the major
and his team will be providing backup
in any 4400 cases
requiring armed intervention.
We know this office bears
a heavy caseload,
and we're here to help when needed.
Welcome aboard.
Hope you guys are up to it, 'cause
I'm going to have you on speed dial.
We'll stay out of your way,
let you do your jobs.
When the time comes,
we hope you'll return the favor.
Well, the last lady that we went up against
released poison spores from her palms, so, uh...
if you want to track her
down instead of me...
by all means.
My men and I are used to
unique challenges.
How long have we been asking
for tactical support?
Eight months.
I guess someone up
there likes us.
You guys check your emails
this morning?
"Happy birthday, Jordan Collier"?
Everyone in the building
got that one.
Maybe Marco should have one
of his guys try to backtrack it.
They already did. It came from
a public terminal in an internet cafe.
It was a new email account.
Nice to know
Collier's still got his fans.
What's that?
It's Valerian root or...
... something. I don't know, Alana swears by it.
They calm me down a little.
My suggestion?
Double your dosage.
The Baldwin trigger has been
a little "hair" lately.
My girlfriend agrees with you.
I need you to cover me
for an hour.
Maia's got the flu or something, and
Hudson wants her to spend the day here.
She okay?
I'm sure it's nothing.
I mean, I was sure that it was the bubonic plague,
but her doctor tells me that it's nothing.
So you plowed into some guy
and got away with it?
That's kind of a weird way to put it.
Well, the perks of having
a dad at NTAC, I guess.
And this guy you hit,
how messed up was he?
I can't really talk about it.
You know, it's lawyer stuff.
Who am I going to tell?
I broke both his legs
and his collarbone.
That's it?
He was in a car, Danny.
It's not like I mowed over a pedestrian.
Yeah, but you kept talking about this "awful thing"
you did. I thought you killed somebody.
What?
Well, thanks a lot, man.
So did Shawn.
Well, sorry to disappoint you guys.
Well, look, do me a favor, okay?
If you get in trouble again,
tell somebody.
There's nothing you can tell me
or Shawn that we can't handle.
Next time I black out and have a car accident,
you'll be the first to know.
Yeah, long as I'm not riding shotgun.
Oh, hey, listen, you want to go see
Arcade Fire with me on friday night, or
do you have to stay home
and nurse your guilty conscience?
No nursing. I'll go.
- Yeah?
- I'll go.
- All right.
- Yeah.
It's good to have you back.
Good to be back.
I got to go.
Okay. See you.
You hear that?
That buzz?
What is it?
What?
Is that coming from your gadget?
Is what coming from my gadget?
That noise.
I don't hear anything.
Neither do I.
What is that noise?
You hear that?
What's going on?
I've got, like, a headache.
Did you hear that?
A gift from me to you
Have fun trying to survive the day
Why is my signature
on this requisition?
Because I had to get it in!
Do not sign my name
on another report.
They sit on your desk for weeks.
If there's a space for my signature,
it should be my signature!
Foster and McCenahan are tearing
each other apart by the elevator.
Right before this started,
there was a noise.
I didn't hear anything.
Yeah, well, the rest of us did!
There was some kind
of high-pitched whine,
and we got another one of those emails.
It said, "have fun trying to survive the day".
Show me.
Okay, everybody try to stay calm.
If this noise or signal did something
to you... you've got to fight it.
What she's talking about?
What did I just tell you?
- Nina.
- You saw it.
She pulled her weapon first.
I was defending myself...
How is she?
Breathing.
She's bleeding pretty bad.
Get her to medical.
Park is under arrest.
Crowley, restrain him.
Baldwin, what are you doing?
Until we know what's going on,
nobody gets in and nobody goes out.
What's going on?
Security procedure enabled.
Who's a very good girl?
Isabelle is.
Isabelle's a smartie.
Glad to see you guys are having fun.
Lily. I didn't expect to
see you till 5:00.
Well, I'm taking an early lunch. I thought
I'd take Isabelle out to the garden.
That sounds fun.
Doesn't it, little girl?
Oh, I use flash cards with her
all the time.
Let's see if I can find an apple.
It's her favorite.
What is this?
Someone's been mixing up our cards.
I've told them a million times.
What do you use these for?
These don't belong in the nursery.
I think they use them for the applicants.
Part of their psych profile. Sorry.
Okay, Isabelle.
Going to go with mommy.
Okay.
See you real soon.
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.
It's a potent combination.
The movement's 100,000 members
would certainly agree,
but Kevin Burkhoff, a neuroscientist
at Western Washington University,
thinks otherwise.
Uh, I don't question anybody's faith.
Why should I? Faith is a good thing, right?
But what they're doing over there at the center
has nothing to do with science. I mean,
you tell me how fasting,
meditation, and chanting
can alter, in any way, your
neurochemistry. It's preposterous.
It's a good scam,
but still preposterous.
"Scam". That's a strong word.
It fits. They're taking
this kernel of truth
about the brain's potential, and using it
to bilk people out of their life savings.
A lot of people might be surprised
by your stance. After all,
you suffered from paranoid
personality disorder for years.
Wasn't it a device engineered
by a 4400 that cured you?
Yes, and I'm grateful,
but you need to make the distinction
between the 4400 and the 4400 center.
4400s have remarkable abilities...
everybody knows it...
but the center is co-opting
that phenomenon for profit.
Those machines they're hooking
people up to over there?
They might as well not
even be plugged in.
If you ask me, he still
looks rather demented.
He seemed pretty sane to me, Matthew,
especially when he was ripping us...
Shawn, don't overreact.
It's just one interview.
Oh...
You did good, though.
Yeah.
Garrity, give me the gun.
Look, this is crazy, Baldwin.
How are we going to
defend ourselves?
Whoever's doing this wants us
to attack each other.
If we stay armed, we're dead
by the end of the day.
If we don't, we'll be slaughtered.
Look, everyone in the building
is under the effects of this thing, okay?
The cafeteria staff could be
forming an army right now.
Which is why I'll find out
who's doing this and stop it.
They're doing checkups in the medical lab today.
That means there's 4400s in the building.
You think that one of them
is behind this?
I...
I don't know,
but right now,
it's all I have to go on.
You?
Who put you in command?
He's not. I am.
This building is the target
of a 4400 terrorist attack.
It is now a military situation.
This is great, Baldwin.
Why don't you explain to these guys
why they should just lay down their arms, huh?
Major Culp, the signal, whatever it is,
it's like someone set off a rage bomb.
It's pumping up the aggression of everybody
in the building. The men, anyway.
We cannot be walking around
with loaded firearms.
My team's trained to resist
psychological pressure tactics.
This is a 4400 ability.
You can't resist it.
There's 4400s down in the med lab.
It's probably one of them doing it.
Baldwin was just headed
down there right now.
Cartwright, watch them.
Everyone else, with me.
Just wait. Wait.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to find out which one of
them's responsible for this.
And then what?
I'm going to make sure that it stops.
Be careful.
There's a little girl down there.
If it's not her,
then she has nothing
to worry about.
You have to let me out!
We got to get out!
We're going to get killed!
Would you stop saying
that already?
It's not helping.
An "a"?
That's great.
But what's my name
doing on here?
Well, we're lab partners, right?
This is our presentation.
But I haven't met with you in almost three
weeks. I didn't type a word of this.
Well, it's not like you didn't do anything.
You said you wanted to do a paper on mitosis.
You stained the slides.
One or two of them, maybe.
Look... you were in trouble, right?
I just figured
that whatever it was,
you could probably do without
an "incomplete" in bio.
I still don't know if I deserve this,
but thank you.
What can I say?
I have a soft spot for stray cats.
I look that pathetic?
Hardly.
You're shooting up?
Doesn't exactly fill me
with confidence.
It's a sedative.
If I lose control
and become like everyone
else in this place,
I can't help you anymore.
What's happening to my agents?
I don't feel any different,
but they're all going crazy.
Dr. Hudson?
I feel worse.
You shouldn't be out of bed.
Sweetie, what's that on your arm?
Skouris, NTAC.
I need to get past.
Building's locked down.
Well, what's going on?
Security breach from the inside.
That's all we know.
- I have to get through.
- That's not going to happen.
You don't understand.
My daughter's in there.
Thursday, July 28
3:19 pm
Well, I can't do it myself.
Turn around.
Hold still.
I can't believe you
broke my nose.
Yeah, well, you broke
my knuckle when I hit you.
But I'm still right.
The signal is constant.
It doesn't matter if you can hear it
or not. It's like a dog whistle.
It's one pulse, and it'll wear off.
We just have to wait it out...
Both of you guys shut up!
I'm trying to get work done.
Not a good time, Diana.
Marco, what's going on in there?
Depends on who you ask.
Somebody's definitely
set off a whammy in here.
Something's pumping up
our "fight or flight" instincts.
Heavy emphasis
on the "fight" part.
Well, Marco, I need to get inside,
and I need your help.
Every male in this building has got a gallon of
adrenaline coursing through his veins right now.
And most of them are armed.
If you're on the outside, stay there.
Listen to me, Marco. Maia is inside,
and I need to get to her.
Do you have access
to the building schematics?
Uh, yeah.
I can pull them up.
Do it.
And what do I get in return?
Well, we can talk about that later.
Good. Good.
I'm going to hold you to that.
Get off me.
You're in my space!
Hang on.
- You're in my space!
- Guys!
Settle it later!
We've got to get
Skouris into the building.
I said get on your knees.
I just need to take these.
They're keeping me calm.
Little late for that.
You sure you don't want one?
They might help.
Cut us loose. Come on.
Cut me free.
Get some cuffs.
Put them on commando-boy.
Then you can let everybody else go.
Hey, hey, where are you going?
I'm going to the med labs. Hopefully
the major met some resistance along the way.
What kind of tests?
You mean like an I.Q. thing?
I don't know, Richard.
Those flash cards were weird,
and after we got back,
I was changing her.
She has these marks on her skin.
Marks? Bruises?
No. Like irritations.
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.
Let me see.
They faded.
Richard...
don't look at me like that.
I'm not imagining things.
She's not going back
to that nursery.
Lily... all you've been talking about
is how much you love Ruth
and the nursery, and how much
Isabelle seems to love it there.
I wish you'd been there.
I mean, Ruth, she had
this weird smile on her face.
Think about what you're saying.
Nobody's doing tests on her at the nursery.
You know, I know you feel
like she's shutting you out, and
no offense, but maybe
this is an overreaction.
- Can I take her for a second?
- No.
Lily, what are you doing?
I'm sorry.
It's just this place.
I feel like it's changing everything,
like it's changing us.
We're okay.
Everything's okay.
The meditation courses, the synaptic potential
readers, and our purification seminars...
that's half our curriculum
you're putting on the chopping block.
We don't need them, Matthew.
Jordan seemed to think we did.
Jordan's not here anymore, is he?
Besides, that Burkhoff guy is right...
a bunch of chanting is not going to
unlock the 4400 inside of anyone.
Whether it will or it won't,
the product is selling.
Wait, wait, wait.
"Product"?
This is not a pyramid scheme, Matthew.
People are coming here, they're looking to be
changed. They're looking for answers.
And we'll find them,
but if we change, we look weak.
For now, all that matters is that
people believe in what we're doing.
I need to believe in it, too.
Nobody move!
They're gone.
They all took off.
Who are you?
Roger Wolcott.
I'm just here for my checkup.
The 4400?
Why else would I be here?
Now cut me loose!
Thursday, July 28
4:22 pm
That's not going to hold anybody.
Not for long. Let's hope no one finds us.
What do you think
our chances are?
The calmer we are,
the longer we stay alive.
How are you doing, sweetie?
I feel all sweaty,
and it's getting hard to breathe.
Poor baby.
I have something for you.
- Lemon.
- Yeah.
As soon as this is over, I'm going
to get you to the hospital, okay?
All right.
I'm guessing you don't have
a stuffed animal for me.
Maybe a fifth of Jack Daniels?
Sorry.
Looks like it's starting to clot.
You need another shot for pain?
No.
You need the sedatives
more than I do.
How many shots have you taken?
Three.
And you're still on your feet? Shouldn't that
have knocked you on your ass by now?
Well, on a normal day, I'd be out
for the next 12 hours, but today,
it's barely enough
to keep me sane.
Well, thank you...
for keeping Maia safe.
She's a sweet kid.
Listen, Diana...
Iook, I've only got
three shots left.
They're wearing off a little
faster each time, so...
I don't want to hurt anybody.
I don't want to kill anybody. So if I...
... start to go...
Oh, don't worry.
I'll take care of you.
Do me a favor...
... back of the head, okay?
You'll never see it coming.
Now, listen, Hudson...
Look, I just gave you permission
to blow my head off.
Why don't you call me Max?
All right, Max.
About this signal...
Which one of these bitches
do you think is sending it?
I don't see what this
has to do with anything.
Hey, you wanted to
know my story.
Well, right now, you're living it.
Open your eyes.
Now, imagine three years went
by while you had them shut.
Can't do it.
Neither could I...
but they were gone.
I missed senior year of high school,
which is supposedly the best year ever.
I got robbed. The rest
of high school just sucked.
So this blackout that
you had behind the wheel,
that was some sort of
after-effect of the coma?
Yeah.
Wow.
God, you've been through so much.
You're jealous?
What part sounds good?
The coma?
The hit and run?
I'm jealous
because you have all
this experience under your belt.
It makes you interesting.
But I didn't do it.
It wasn't me.
Great, so now someone
can kill me in my sleep.
How do you know it's one of us?
Well, I don't,
but none of you are talking,
and so I'm about out of options.
This isn't going to make
a damn bit of difference.
That's it.
No more sedatives.
Can you still function as a doctor?
For now.
Kind of busy here, Diana.
We just put the 4400s under, but we're
not sure if that's killed the signal.
Do you still feel amped up?
Yes, I do, okay?
I'm working on it from my end.
What's that noise?
I'm trying to counter
the effects of the signal.
If you'd just shut up for a second,
maybe I could find the right frequency...
Okay, calm down, Marco.
I need you to do this.
It always has to be me,
doesn't it?
Old, reliable Marco
does whatever you want.
I truly believe in what
we're trying to do.
The 4400 are the template
for the next stage in human evolution.
Do you mind backing up?
You're standing a little close.
We can recreate the technology
they used to change us.
Not by chanting "om"
three times, you can't.
Agreed...
But if you come to work with us,
we could get somewhere.
You know,
the government
has approached me
half a dozen times.
They seem to have
this bizarre theory I'm
the father of this new branch
of science. I turned them down.
I don't like working
with people with badges.
Listen, you can't blame
them for being curious.
You were in a mental hospital
for... six years?
The future busted its ass
to get you working again.
I haven't forgotten my debts.
Oh? What's that?
Signing bonus?
Fancy car?
Me.
I'm the poster boy, right?
Healing hands.
Unlimited access.
Can you really turn that down?
Mommy,
I'm scared.
I know, baby.
I'm scared too.
But it's going to be okay,
because mommy's here.
Okay?
Whatever's coming
through that door...
I'll protect you.
Tom.
Tom... put the gun down.
It's me. It's Diana.
No, you'll... you'll shoot me
if I put it down.
No, Tom.
I don't want to hurt you.
Well, I want to hurt you, Diana.
Tom... I said calm down.
My mom always wanted me
to hit it off with a cute doctor,
but make another move,
and I will pull this trigger.
What is that?
That'd be Marco
earning his paycheck.
I feel like an idiot.
It's just... Isabelle and I
were so close for so long.
And you still are.
I know.
It's like you say...
She's a baby.
It isn't personal.
Yeah, you just have
to remember that.
Hey, Ruth, look who's back.
That was a long lunch.
Yeah, sorry.
Time got away from us.
Come on. Here you are.
We'll be back in an hour for her.
- We'll be here.
- Thank you.
Bye, Isabelle.
I'd still like to do
a little house-hunting.
We could take a look around,
see what's out there.
You're in charge until I'm released.
Pool whatever manpower is still up walking.
Start picking up the pieces.
- I'll handle it.
- Mm-hmm.
All right. And you get
that head looked at.
How are you doing?
Well, for a slender lady,
you pack a punch.
I can't take all the credit.
Culp softened you up a little bit.
Hmm.
It's the final tally.
Three agents dead, two N.S.A.
operatives, a 4400...
concussions, broken bones,
stab wounds... yikes.
It's tough to swallow. It was
a major attack, and we weren't ready.
Yeah.
How are you, baby?
Okay.
Not so good.
I've got her on glucose
and erythromycin.
We're going to get her over to St. Michael's
and see if we can bring that fever down.
And the rash?
I'm going to bring in a specialist.
Should I be worried?
Brett Kellerman is one of the best dermatologists
in the city. I'm sure he'll figure it out.
You're coming with us,
right?
Of course. I'll be right there
in the ambulance with you.
All right, I'll get to the hospital
as soon as I can.
Okay.
- Oh, Max...
- Yeah.
Thank you... for everything.
No, thank you, for...
well, for not putting one
in the back of my head.
Uh, so those 4400s
Diana was protecting...
they're not going to see daylight until NTAC's
sure they're not responsible for this.
That's going to be
a marathon debriefing session.
Yeah, I bet you they'll
both be up all night.
Both?
I thought Diana said
there was three of them.
Tom?
She's gone.
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified government facility,
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.
Do they even have
a name for that?
Yeah, "terrorism".
Payback is a bitch.
Welcome to the center.
Would you like to sign up for the tour?
No.
Tell Shawn Farrell that Kevin
Burkhoff is here to see him.
I'm sorry. Mr. Farrell's
busy at the moment.
Is there a message
I can pass along?
Yes.
I want to get
started immediately.
You can stay over if you like.
Get some dinner,
do a little studying...
Kyle?
Are you okay?
I don't deserve you.
That is so sweet.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Shawn...
this is Olivia Cohen.
Take a seat here.
Mm-hmm.
That's good.
She lost her eyesight to macular
degeneration 10 years ago.
The foundation was
very moved by her story.
Hi, Mrs. Cohen.
Hello.
It's nice to meet you.
So, uh,
what we're going to do here
is going to feel
a little weird, but
when we're done,
you'll be able to see again.
Oh, I can't wait.
I have to admit,
I'm a little nervous.
You don't have to be.
I'm going to take
your hands now, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Here we go.
Here we go.
So when does it start?
When do I see again?
Just give me a moment.
Shawn?
Oh...
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Is it warm in here?
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world
will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
This is where
I give you the speech
about how you're
my best field scientist
and Tom is my best
lead investigator,
and how together,
you're going to make
a good team.
Let me see
if I've got this straight...
you two met,
fell in love,
and spent eight years together
in some kind
of alternate reality.
Yeah.
What time is the flight?
Uh, noon.
Say goodbye to mom for me.
They arrested a suspect
40 minutes ago.
Claim he's our guy.
Roy Keith Marsden.
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.
It's going to feel
a little weird,
but when we're done,
you'll be able
to see again.
When does it start?
When do I see again?
Just give me one moment, okay?
Kevin's a genius, you know.
You're saying that Burkhoff
is the father
of the 4400 technology.
I can think again, too.
You've got
a real fever,
young lady.
I worked at the CDC
for seven years,
and I never saw
anything like it.
I was changing her.
She has these marks on her skin.
Marks? Bruises?
No. Like irritations.
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.
What did I just tell you?
You're in charge
until I'm released.
Pool whatever manpower
is still up walking.
Start picking up the pieces.
I'll handle it.
Don't worry about it.
Okay, seriously,
my back is about
to call it a day.
Just come on...
You're not helping.
Where's this going?
Right there.
Please say
that was the last box.
That's it.
We're officially
living in sin.
Oh, really.
Well, I prefer to call it
"resuming
our eight-year marriage".
Call it whatever you want.
Just don't kiss
in front of me again, okay?
That's disgusting.
Oh, your father thinks
this is so romantic,
but what
he doesn't know
is the reason
I'm moving in
is to take down
his tacky golf stuff.
What?
And replace it
with what?
Oh, oh,
paint splatters?
Maybe a picture
of a triangle...
- Kids!
- It's art.
Work out
these decorating issues
amongst yourselves,
but I'm dead serious
about this kissing rule, okay?
It's non-negotiable.
Oh, Kyle,
my allergies are
bothering me again.
Could you write me
another prescription
before you go?
Uh, Alana...
Kyle's only a doctor
in the world you created for me,
remember?
I'm sorry.
I had a brain freeze.
Right.
Trying to decipher
my handwriting?
I was just on the verge
of giving up, actually.
Good.
Bad penmanship
is the best way
for a doctor to keep
his mystique.
There's a page missing
in there.
It goes from page four
to page six.
Sorry.
I'm breaking in a new nurse.
So listen, I think
we finally know
what's wrong
with your daughter.
Maia's suffering
from a type of pneumonia
called "Pneumocystis Jiroveci".
It's "P.J.P." for short.
I've never heard of it.
It's rare,
but we can treat it...
Well, thank god.
But this kind
of pneumonia
could be a symptom
for something more serious.
We've tested her
for every virus...
all negative.
So where is it coming from?
We don't know,
but we're running more tests.
We'll figure it out.
It's not that big
of a deal.
You know, I've just...
I've been working
real hard lately.
I think I got the flu
or something.
Everybody gets that,
right?
Sure. It's just...
Shawn...
you can't heal.
For now.
I think you should
get it checked out.
If I can't kick it
in a day or two, I will,
but, uh...
until then,
can you reschedule
all my foundation
appointments?
Tell them that it's temporary.
Make sure they know that.
Lily...
don't tell anyone
I can't heal.
Sure.
Thank you.
Lily...
I mean it. Nobody.
Oh, god.
Ah...
How many are sick?
300... that we know of.
Medical says
more calls keep coming in.
So, what is it?
Well, it's some kind
of immune system disorder,
and it's leaving the 4400
vulnerable
to all kinds of diseases.
His plane landed
at SEATAC
on schedule.
Chopper should be here
any minute.
What's that?
They told me
he likes green tea.
Is it contagious?
We don't know.
Were they infected
while they were gone?
Maybe they brought this
back with them.
Well, maybe.
We just don't know.
The situation is fluid,
but here's a summary
of what we know so far.
Uh, sir?
They told me
you'd want this.
The numbers just keep
getting bigger.
So we're recovering...
... from an attack
on this building...
... the division commander's
still in the hospital...
... what are we
supposed to do?
We take to the field.
Ryland?
Where did he
come from?
We're going to have
every 4400 in this jurisdiction
tested
for this sickness
by day's end.
Dennis, is it good to see you.
Tom.
Diana.
What brings you
to Seattle, Ryland?
I'm assuming temporary command
of this division.
My orders are to do something
about the spread
of this epidemic.
I'm going to figure out a way
to do just that.
You might want
to move that,
unless you want people
calling you "Nina".
How's Jarvis doing?
They set her collarbone.
Doctors said
she'll be back in two weeks.
My guess?
She makes it in one.
Yeah.
So how's D.C.?
Oh, it's a lot of networking.
Lots of dinner parties.
Patty loves it.
And you?
The pacific northwest
is the flashpoint.
I kind of feel
like I was promoted
out of the game.
A lot of guys here
would trade places with you.
I wouldn't blame them.
A woman releases plague
into the air?
A terrorist attack
on the building?
Some people I work for
think you're
in the middle of a war.
I'm sure
it looks that way on paper.
Don't get defensive.
I'm still preaching the gospel
of Highland Beach.
I still believe
the 4400 came back here
to change things for the better.
Yeah, and the people
you work for?
Don't worry
about them.
One day, this'll be over,
we'll go out for a beer,
we'll kick back,
we'll trade war stories.
Yeah.
She was a little cranky
this morning.
I think
she's cutting another tooth.
They're
coming in fast, huh?
She's that age.
Bye, bye, sweetie.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you, ruth.
Lily, what are you doing?
I thought we agreed
nobody was doing
science experiments on our baby.
Just making sure.
Shawn, we need to rearrange
your healing schedule.
There's something going on,
some sort of illness
spreading among the 4400.
I know all about it.
You.
Did you do this?
No, no. It wasn't me.
Then what are you doing here?
I read about this place
in the paper.
I just... I was curious.
Yeah?
Well, go be curious
somewhere else,
because people
still live here, okay?
Do you need some help?
What, are you
a mechanic now?
I can change a tire.
There's probably a jack
in the trunk, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry I snapped at you.
I just... I'm in a hurry, and...
my boyfriend's little brother
is in the principal's office
again,
and he's... not here...
again.
I guess he's in
a lot of trouble, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.
Well, I mean,
it's none of my business.
I can just change the tire
and go.
Please.
Hi there.
Welcome to the center.
Are you here to take the tour?
This is wrong.
It's all wrong.
Excuse me?
This is
the Collier museum.
Where are
all the paintings?
Thomas.
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?
I have a board of directors
meeting,
and they won't let me
go upstairs.
Yeah, yeah.
They called me.
They said you were
a little mixed up.
Alana...
this isn't
the Collier museum.
It's...
it's the 4400 center.
What are you
talking about?
I come here
all the time.
Look at me. Look...
Alana...
the place
you're thinking of,
it's somewhere else.
No. No!
Why are you
confusing me?
Just calm down!
No!
It's okay.
It's all right.
The infection rate is 18%.
One in five of them
are already sick?
One in five today.
Tomorrow...
the national
institute of health
is worried that this illness,
whatever it is,
can mutate
and cross over
into the general
population.
Would it even
have to mutate?
There's
no guarantee
that this is going to
stay exclusive to 4400s
and meanwhile,
we've got two dozen sick ones
right downstairs.
They're not going to
be there long.
Why?
What are we doing with them?
D.C. wants to put all the 4400
back in quarantine
and keep them there
for the rest
of the crisis.
I know it's a big move, people,
but it's the best one we've got
at the moment.
Can we do that?
According to emergency
quarantine order 74,
we can.
But wait,
you're just talking
about the sick ones here,
right?
No. All of them.
Every 4400
in the country
is subject to this order.
Okay,
but that's only half of them.
This thing's worldwide, right?
England and France
are passing similar legislation.
We expect
other countries to follow.
But why are you forcing them all
to come in?
Because the disease seems to be
showing up at random.
Until we understand
how it's transmitted,
we have to assume
that every 4400
is a potential vector.
How much time
are we giving them?
We'll make
the announcement
in the morning.
They'll have 12 hours
to get to a local
NTAC branch,
then they'll be
transferred
to Camp Dekker
and the quarantine facility.
What if they don't report?
Then it'll be our job
to bring them in.
You're not hearing me...
it's temporary.
Can you be sure?
You already told me
people in Washington
think we're
fighting a war.
Washington is
full of opinions.
The town runs on them.
The 4400
aren't just names
in some report...
and they're definitely
not enemy combatants.
You're talking
about my daughter,
Tom's nephew...
the woman I love.
I was going to tell you
over that beer.
Now, what assurances
can you give us
that these people
aren't just being
thrown down some hole
permanently?
You have my assurance,
and that should be
enough.
I was the one who pushed
to let them out
in the first place,
you remember?
We're not trying
to second-guess you, Dennis,
but people we love are sick.
I get it,
but getting them all
together in one place
is going to make it
a lot easier
to find out
what the hell this is.
When it's over,
everybody goes home.
We know you'll
fight the good fight, Dennis.
I just hope you can win.
Mommy?
You're awake.
How are you, baby?
I'm tired of being sick.
When can I go home?
Why don't you tell me?
I was kind of hoping
you'd had a vision,
about how all this
will be over soon.
They're not coming
anymore.
I'm not seeing things.
My favorite patient
is awake.
More awake than you look.
Mm.
Open wide.
I do my best work
when I eliminate sleep
altogether.
Well, if you need someone
to splash cold water
on your face,
you just let me know.
Thanks.
Do you mind?
I noticed that missing page
made its way back in.
Oh. Yeah.
I told you it'd be back.
What are those two lines
blacked out for?
Well, looks like
we duplicated a test.
They cross it out
so we don't read
the same results twice.
Okay, let's see
how that rash is doing.
I'm fine, Brian.
Tell Heidi not to worry.
Richard's fine.
Isabelle's fine.
Well, the news
is making it sound
like everybody's sick.
People are terrified,
and if normal people
start getting sick...
"Normal people"?
Okay, that
came out wrong,
but you know
what I mean.
And listen, Lily,
heidI's not the only one
that's worried about you.
I am, too.
A year and a half ago,
you welcomed me home
with a restraining order.
I know.
I panicked when you got back.
Don't think I haven't lost sleep
over what I did.
I just want you
to know now
that I'm there for you.
You, Richard, Isabelle...
You need anything...
just call.
"Quarantine".
That's an evocative word
these days.
Conjures up images
of secret prisons and...
what's the euphemism
you're using now?
"Coercion tactics"?
Let me ask you something...
you have some doctors
on staff here, right?
Yes.
They having any luck
getting to the bottom
of this thing?
Not yet.
Then get off
your soapbox.
You want an image
to hold on to?
Try this one...
4400s dying in droves.
I think what my partner
means to say
is that our
two organizations
need each other.
We should cooperate.
And how exactly
do we do that?
We want you to issue
a public statement.
If the center
counsels the 4400s
to go along
with this order,
things will go
much more smoothly.
And if we don't?
Why are we talking
to you, anyway?
Where's Shawn?
Is he all right?
Mr. Farrell
is handling urgent business.
This situation requires
his full attention.
Look, I'll have to
run it by him,
but I don't see a problem
advising any ill 4400s
to seek medical care
from NTAC.
Well, that's a start.
What about the ones
who aren't
showing symptoms?
That issue's going to require
a little more thought.
Great.
You have 12 hours.
What's the point
of painting it over,
anyway?
They're just gonna
do it again.
We don't know that.
Look, Sam,
Kyle has been nice enough
to come over here
and help us out,
so the least that you can do
is pitch in.
Oh, yes, very good...
... Picasso.
I'm going to make sandwiches.
Okay, seriously,
what's your story?
Why are you helping us,
Kyle whoever-you-are?
My last name's Bingham...
... and I don't know.
I was just walking by here
yesterday.
Alison looked
like she could use a hand...
Yeah, well,
if you were thinking
about hooking up with her,
forget it.
Alison's gonna
marry my brother
as soon as he gets out of jail.
I know. I know.
She told me.
You should listen to her.
Roy didn't kill
this Collier guy.
I believe you.
Yeah?
Well, you're the only one.
You and me.
When he does get out,
I don't think
you want him coming home
and seeing "murderer"
written all over his door,
do you?
Richard...
you ready for a promotion?
Me?
A promotion to what?
I'm trying here, man.
I want to lead us all
through this,
but I can't do that right now.
Thank you.
I know I'm a 4400,
but after that,
my qualifications
are a little thin.
They didn't even give me
an ability.
To be honest with you,
I'm not sure how long
Lily and I were planning
on staying here.
So it's not a perfect fit,
but you're articulate,
and a war hero,
and you have
the gravitas
of a leader.
I think
it's a good idea.
I haven't given an order
since 1951.
I was in high school
a year and a half ago.
I managed.
So will you.
But it's only temporary, right?
As soon as you get better,
I can go right back
to being camera-shy.
Yeah.
Temporary.
What are you going to do?
What I have to.
Desease has everyone frightened,
and that's understandable.
But no one's more frightened
than we are.
And that's because,
in spite of all the rumors
that you hear flying around,
only 4400s
are getting sick,
and now the government
wants us to head
into quarantine.
They say cooperation
is essential.
Well, here's
the best we can do...
If you're sick,
the responsible thing
is to report to NTAC.
Our best wishes
and prayers
go with you.
But if you're well,
if you're showing no symptoms,
we ask you to consider this...
walking into quarantine
is an easy step,
but walking out...
that might be
considerably more difficult.
Thank you.
Don't they get it?
We're trying
to help these people.
All they hear is
"quarantine", Dennis.
You can't blame them
for being scared.
Maybe if we give them
another day,
half a day, even.
Does it look to you
like they haven't
made up their minds?
We tried
being reasonable.
In 10 hours,
we start rounding them up.
Hi.
Hey.
I know who you are.
You're the one
who fixes people.
Yeah. Shawn.
How come you're in here?
Why don't you just
make yourself better?
I wish I could.
They're broken.
Kind of like
the rest of me.
I used to see things.
Stuff that was
gonna happen.
That's gone now too.
It's funny, huh?
When I found out
I was different,
all I wanted to do
was be normal again.
Me too.
But you
get used to it.
Now that it's gone,
I feel like I'm missing an arm.
It'll come back.
Once we get better.
Any idea when that's gonna be?
Not exactly,
but my mom told me
everything's gonna be fine,
and I believe what she says.
That must be a nice feeling.
Don't you have someone
to believe in?
I used to...
but now I guess
I'm just going to have to
believe in you.
You're the one
I attacked
at the hospital.
We didn't think
you'd remember us.
I remember.
I was...
very sick back then.
I'm better now.
Diana, you wanted
to see me?
Kevin Burkhoff.
I've been doing
neurological research
on the 4400.
Oh, I've heard of you.
Everybody here has.
Here.
There's some very
interesting data
on the blood work
I've been doing.
Have a look.
See if it helps you figure out
what's going on
with this disease.
Well, thank you.
I'll comb
through this.
Good,
and I can expect
to see your work... when?
I showed you mine.
You show me yours.
That is the way
it works,
isn't it?
Usually,
but the research we do here
is classified.
Max...
Max, if ever
there was a time
to bend the rules
a little,
I think
it might be now.
Well, it's not
a wink-and-a-nudge situation.
I give over
classified documents,
I go to jail.
Yeah, and if you don't,
people might die.
Are you implying we're not doing
everything we can?
We've got dozens
of doctors
working
around the clock
to try to solve this thing.
Now, I will look over
everything that you've given me.
If I find anything
that can help you,
I'll give you a call.
That's the best I can do.
I am so sorry...
I'm not interested
in apologies.
I want to see
that information.
Or is NTAC not interested
in curing these people?
I know you guys
are kind of cavalier
about putting your own careers
on the line,
but do me a favor...
stop asking me
to join in the fun, okay?
I like what I do here.
They're medical records, Marco.
Not national secrets.
Wrong.
They're medical records
and national secrets.
That is why they keep them
in a database
you need six passwords
to get into,
and that's why sport-o
wouldn't give them to you.
Let's just leave Max
out of this.
He's under a lot of pressure.
And he wants
to keep his job.
I don't blame him.
You know, I just
opened a 401(k).
Yeah, pretty sure
the government stops
matching donations
once you commit treason.
The government
just turned down
an offer of help
from Kevin Burkhoff.
Remember him?
Yeah, the future
built a giant tower
to wake him up.
I guess they think he matters.
If anyone in Washington
read my report,
they know
he matters, too.
You know, it's weird.
Hundreds of people are sick.
You'd think they'd want
any help they could get.
Well, they're going to
get his help.
Yeah, whether they want it
or not.
Gotcha.
Yeah.
Is Isabelle ready
to go for her walk?
Okay, let's go have some fun.
How long has she
been in there?
I don't know.
Five minutes.
I came and got you
as soon as I saw.
What are they
doing to her in there?
Step back.
Would you excuse us, please?
How long has this been going on?
Richard, your daughter
has never been
in any kind of danger.
He asked you a question.
Jordan was going to
initiate these tests
as soon as he convinced you
to come back into the fold...
What tests?
What have you been doing to her?
All we're doing
is what you should have done
a long time ago...
trying to figure out who,
or what, Isabelle is.
She's our daughter.
That's all you
or anyone else
your daughter
is the Rosetta Stone
for understanding
what happened to the 4400,
yet you both cling
to the illusion
that she's going to go
to preschool,
first communion, the prom...
She's not communal property.
We're her parents. We decide.
Parents?
You are the stewards
of the future,
and forgive me for saying so,
but you're doing
a piss-poor job of it.
We have given up
everything we have
for that child,
any chance we had
of living a normal life...
To protect her
from people like you.
Look, Richard, this is no time
for this conversation.
In two hours,
the government is
coming through the front door.
Yeah, well,
you won't use my daughter
as some kind of weapon
against them.
That was never my intention.
You'll never have the chance.
We're leaving right now.
That's your choice,
but if you do,
if we splinter now,
they will round up the 4400 one by one,
and this movement is over.
Hey.
Hey, Thomas.
Hey.
They said
you've been asking for me.
Shouldn't you be in bed?
They'll take me back
soon enough.
I wanted to see you.
How do you feel, baby?
They can't get the fever down,
but...
the worst part is my head.
Everything's so mixed up.
This illness,
it affects people's abilities.
Maia can't see things, and...
and Shawn, Shawn can't heal,
and for you, honey,
I think the boundaries
between this world
and the one you created
are breaking down.
It's so confusing.
I don't know
what's real anymore.
I know it's scary.
You just have to hang on.
They'll get this fixed.
What if they're too late?
What if they can
make my body right,
but not my mind?
I don't want to live like that,
Thomas.
You're not
going to have to.
You're going to get better.
You have to believe that, Alana.
Thomas...
Yeah?
I love you so much.
I wanted us to get married
for real,
in this world.
That's all I wanted to tell you,
before...
before my mind goes...
because...
I don't know
if it will be good again.
So you're sure I can't get you
a beer or something?
No, no,
that's okay.
I don't drink.
Okay.
You know, this isn't
really necessary.
I just did
a couple of chores.
Maybe it's not a big deal
to you,
but I just haven't seen
a friendly face
in a while,
not since... Roy went away.
No offense, but, um...
the papers make him sound
like the second coming
of Lee Harvey Oswald.
Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it
"fair and balanced coverage".
But he did have
some monstrous gun collection,
right?
Look, I'm not saying
that he was a candidate
for higher office,
and...
he sure as hell
wasn't the world's
greatest boyfriend.
But taking out
two NTAC agents
and shooting Jordan Collier?
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Eat up.
Sam!
Sam, come on!
We're starting.
I'll be right there.
Hey.
Okay.
Are you Marco?
Thanks.
Don't thank me.
Hire me.
I'm gonna need a job.
Where have you been?
Talking to Matthew.
Lily...
he's got an idea
on how to handle
this roundup.
I think it might work.
I'm sure
he's full of clever ideas.
We will deal with
what Matthew did,
but not now.
The government is about
to declare martial law
we don't have time to squabble.
All I want to hear
is that you're done
with this place for good.
It's not that simple.
We can't just go off
and hide in the woods somewhere.
It's not going to work
this time.
The center betrayed us.
They betrayed our daughter.
And they learned
about her,
more than we did
in almost a year.
Lily, stop.
Did you know
Isabelle has connections
between the right and left
hemispheres of her brain
that have never been
seen before?
Even if that's true, Richard...
it's not that they studied her.
It's how they did it.
Do you trust
the government?
Because
if we go into quarantine,
Isabelle will end up
right here,
or with them,
and if they find out
what she can do...
we'll lose her forever.
That's it.
That's the deadline.
Where do we start?
I want everybody
to holster their pistols.
My goal is to do this quietly,
peacefully,
and without incident.
What if they want
an incident?
Then we'll give them one.
Is everybody ready?
Affirmative, sir.
We're in position.
Let's go.
Moving in now.
Copy that.
They're on the move.
They're
spreading out
and letting us
through.
Welcome to the center.
Did you come for the tour?
You know damn well
why we're here.
Out hunting, I'd guess.
Well, I'm afraid
you've come to the wrong place.
You are welcome to look around,
but there are no 4400 here.
I have no idea
where they went.
You had 120 4400s
taking shelter at your center.
That sounds about right.
I don't have an exact figure.
You just came
downstairs,
and they were gone?
Until 7:00 this evening,
they were free citizens.
I had no reason
to track
their movements,
and since I've broken no laws,
unless you want to talk about
lifting this quarantine order,
we have nothing left to discuss.
We'll talk again.
I suspect your job
is going to get rather ugly
from here on out,
kicking in doors
and such.
If I worked at NTAC,
I might spend a little less time
trying to find missing 4400s,
and a little more
trying to cure the ones I had.
So tell me,
have we got a list?
Yeah,
all the sick ones we know of are in.
As for the rest,
we had about 75% compliance.
Nationwide,
there's about 520 4400s
unaccounted for.
Well, that's not a few holdouts.
That's an insurgency.
So this is it, huh?
Us against them.
You know, it feels
kind of like the war
Jordan Collier always predicted.
Predicted or provoked?
We declared martial law on them.
We had no option.
I'm going to pursue
a policy of non-aggression
as long as I can,
but if it comes down
to a choice
between the safety
of the American people
and the welfare
of the 4400...
Tom...
... that's no choice at all.
Collier left behind
37 safe houses
throughout the country.
We liquidated the center's
emergency slush fund
should last for awhile.
Any 4400
who contacts the center
for help
will be given
an email address.
If we're satisfied
they're legitimate,
they'll be told
where to go.
Our goal is to get
every 4400 who wants shelter
to safety.
And then what?
Matthew will try
to continue
to end this peacefully,
but if we have to
protect our own...
... we'll be ready.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Lily...
You make a good speech,
but this isn't Korea,
and those
aren't soldiers...
And your daughter
could get caught
in the crossfire.
You don't think
I'm worried about her?
And you too?
Lily, I'm not looking
for a fight,
but right now,
we don't have another option.
Hey. Sam said he liked comics...
you son of a bitch!
You lied to me.
What?
Wait a minute.
It wasn't like that.
Oh, really,
"Kyle Bingham"?
Your last name is Baldwin,
and your dad works
for NTAC.
So, what are you?
His little spy? Huh?
Did you think you were going to
sleep with me?
I was going to tell you
all about Roy?
You go and you tell your daddy
that he didn't kill anybody.
I know that.
I was just trying to help you.
Why?
You come off like you're
this really great guy,
and all you were trying to do
was use me.
You're a lying prick.
Okay.
Okay.
This thing that's
killing them,
it's not a disease.
It's a side-effect.
Dr. Burkhoff,
just calm down.
What are you
talking about?
A side-effect of what?
I don't know exactly,
but I do know this...
there's a synthetic substance
present in the blood
of every 4400,
all the ones I tested,
every medical report
you gave me,
sick ones, well ones,
doesn't matter.
They all have it.
They even gave it a name.
They call it
"promicin inhibitor".
Promicin?
What's promicin?
I have no idea,
and I don't know why anyone
would want to inhibit it,
either.
But whatever it is,
it's gathering
in their lymph nodes,
compromising
their immune systems...
it's what's making them sick.
But NTAC's been
studying the 4400
ever since
they got back.
- They should have known about this.
- They do know.
It's all in here. They know.
So why haven't they
told anyone?
That's a very good question.
When you find out,
why don't you tell me?
Are you sure
you want to do this?
Just get me and Isabelle
someplace safe.
"P.I. dosage"...
it's on memos,
in every 4400 medical report.
It's on the fifth page
of every report.
That's what Hudson
had crossed out
when I went to see Maia.
"P.I."
"Promicin inhibitor".
Alana was getting it too,
and Shawn.
Everyone was getting it.
Every time
they came to NTAC medical.
Every checkup.
We did it to them, Tom.
We made them sick.
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world
will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.
Roy Marsden didn't kill
Jordan Collier.
And neither did you, Kyle.
Son of a bitch!
You go and you
tell your daddy
that he didn't kill anybody.
If Maia's having visions,
you should know about it,
and you should know
what they are.
Mommy's bosses
will be punished
for betraying us.
I want to go home.
I know you do, honey,
but Dr. Hudson is going to take
very good care of you.
Don't tell anyone
I can't heal.
Sure.
What are you going to do?
What I have to.
If you're sick,
the responsible thing
is to report to NTAC,
but if you are well...
walking into quarantine
is an easy step,
but walking out, that might be
considerably more difficult.
There's a synthetic substance
present in the blood
of every 4400.
They even gave it a name.
They call it...
... "Promicin inhibitor".
Every time
they came to NTAC medical,
every checkup.
Your daughter
is the Rosetta Stone
for understanding
what happened to the 4400.
We're her parents.
We decide.
Are you sure
you want to do this?
Just get me and Isabelle
someplace safe.
But if it comes down
to a choice
between the safety
of the American people
and the welfare
of the 4400,
Tom...
that's no choice at all.
We tried being reasonable.
In 10 hours,
we start rounding them up.
Easy, McCullough.
Let me go! I'm not sick!
There's nothing wrong with me!
We know that,
but you're a 4400,
and everybody's
got to go in.
Come on...
Now, I don't want
to cuff you,
but if you run again,
you're going to
give me no choice.
"Quarantine"
is just a word to you guys.
Try living it.
Come on.
What are we
doing here, Diana?
This is so wrong.
All right,
what do you suggest?
We walk into
the middle of NTAC,
and shout out,
"We did this.
We made them sick".
Yeah, yeah, that's good start.
We've got the medical records.
We can take them to Dennis.
You really think that Max Hudson
and a couple of rogue doctors
hatched a covert plan
to poison the 4400?
I mean, you really think
that they could do that
without approval?
Whose approval?
Dennis Ryland's, for one.
He was the head
of this division
when this whole thing
started.
I mean, you think
he didn't know?
Until we know
how far up this goes,
we've got to stay calm,
work quietly...
and watch our backs.
Don't tell me to calm down,
Lily.
How am I supposed to be calm
when my wife and daughter
left in the middle of the night?
We didn't leave you, Richard.
I just didn't feel
like Isabelle was safe there.
You've turned this
resisting quarantine
into your
personal mission.
NTAC turned it
into my personal mission
when they started
rounding us up.
And I admire
what you're doing,
but it's not my fight,
and I sure as hell won't let it
become Isabelle's fight.
Just tell me where you are.
Put my mind at ease.
I'll come see you.
Lily?
I'm sorry.
I just feel like
it's better this way for now.
I'll call soon.
That didn't go as well
as mommy hoped.
911. Please state
the nature of...
I need an ambulance.
I'm... I'm sick.
I've got this...
Hello?
Hello?
Miss, are you there?
Never mind.
Think they're sharing
trade secrets?
Either that,
or she's asking
for her office back.
After you.
Thanks.
Nina.
Good to see you.
Thanks.
I wish the circumstances
were a little better.
We lost the first 4400s
to this thing
overnight.
Seven dead.
There'll be more
by day's end.
No word about a vaccine,
a cure?
I just got
off the phone with Hudson.
He said that they've worked
on a few things overnight.
I'm going to quarantine.
Diana...
I know this is frustrating,
but we've got
the best minds in the country,
in the world,
working on this.
Well, they better work fast.
Seven people are dead.
Alana could be next,
or Maia,
and still,
nobody has any idea
where this came from, do they?
We'll get it figured out.
Hey, sweetie.
It's me, Tom.
Who are you?
Who are you?
She was awake earlier.
Only for a few
minutes, though.
Did she say anything?
She talked about you.
Said you were going to
make everything okay.
I hope she's right.
Me too.
Let's go.
Where are we headed?
We've got
an appointment
with the good doctor
Hudson.
Diana, what...
what the hell
are you doing?
We've got some things
we need to talk about.
This guy your agents brought in,
Orson Bailey,
I think I can explain
how he developed this...
Jesus,
I can't even say the word.
Telekinesis.
Thank you.
The body produces four
main neurotransmitters.
They're like traffic cops
to the brain.
They control everything,
regulate everything.
Tell me something I don't know.
Bailey is producing
a fifth neurotransmitter.
We've never seen it before.
Nobody has.
I'm guessing
it factors into Bailey's ability
to bend spoons with his mind.
Let's just say Promicin
is basically a backstage pass
to the V.I.P. section of the brain.
He is using
parts of the cerebellum
no human has ever had access to.
I ran some tests
on the 4400s
who are still
in quarantine.
Every single one of them
is producing trace amounts
of Promicin.
So it's just a matter of time
before every 4400
develops telekinesis?
Promicin's behavior
is unpredictable.
They might not get telekinesis,
but they'll get something.
Put everything on paper.
I want to get
my talking points straight
before I try to explain this to D.C.
D.C. panicked.
I was ordered to work on a drug
to suppress
the production of Promicin
in the 4400.
Once I synthesized
the inhibitor,
we gave it to every 4400,
every time they came in
for a checkup.
But it doesn't even work.
4400s are developing abilities
all the time.
A small percentage of them are,
but if it wasn't
for the inhibitor,
they'd all have them.
I know it didn't
work perfectly.
"Perfectly"?
Seven 4400s died last night.
It was your inhibitor
that did it.
You made them sick!
You think
I don't know that?
We weren't trying
to kill anyone.
We were preserving
the status quo,
doing a good thing.
I guess it backfired.
I am trying to undo it,
but if you want to
pull that trigger,
please, be my guest.
Maybe then
finally I'll get some sleep.
All right.
If you're not going to shoot me,
let me get back to work.
I don't want anyone else to die.
Alison?
What are you doing here?
They're going to
give Roy life.
They're going to
give him life,
and he's
going to take it.
What are you
talking about?
The state was going to go
for the death penalty,
and the public defender
convinced Roy
to take a plea bargain.
But they've got no case
against him.
My dad told me.
I don't know.
This lawyer,
he's handling, like,
10 different cases,
and he just
doesn't want to see
the inside
of a courtroom.
I don't know.
But he didn't do it, okay?
He didn't kill Jordan Collier.
You keep saying that.
Does your dad know something?
What?
Is there evidence
that they're hiding?
What?
You have to tell me.
If Roy takes this deal,
he can't even get parole
for 20 years.
He's not going to prison.
Why?
The 4400 came back August 14th.
Hudson discovered Promicin
October 11th.
So they probably gave
the first doses
of the inhibitor
sometime around
the end of the month.
But we have every
internal document
for october.
There's nothing
about any of this.
There's hardly even
a mention of Orson Bailey.
We both wrote reports
about him, Diana.
They're gone.
They were hoping
that was going to be
the only extrahuman ability
ever developed in a 4400.
If they destroy
all records of it...
nobody would ever know.
But this went to the top
of the food chain.
Here.
Britain, France, Korea...
... everywhere there's a sick 4400.
There has to be a paper trail.
Does it even matter?
I mean,
we could find a memo
signed by the entire
United Nations security council.
It's not going to cure anyone.
Diana, we delivered
confidential medical records
to Dr. Burkhoff.
We've got the so-called
"father of 4400 technology"
working on the case,
and you just
stuck a gun
to the head of NTAC's
medical director.
We've done everything we can
to get the right people
working on a cure.
That's if NTAC
even wants a cure.
Ryland's been talking
about people in D.C.
Who've been on a wartime footing
for months.
This is nothing
but a stroke of luck for them.
You think
they want them all dead?
I told you!
I told you
I wasn't safe here.
It's just a precaution, Kevin.
We think
you'll just be safer
if you move to
a less exposed location.
It's because
I told you
about that inhibitor
thing, right?
I spent six years
in a psychiatric hospital
suffering from paranoid
personality disorder.
As soon as I get out,
you two put me
smack in the middle
of a massive
conspiracy.
Dr. Burkhoff's been spinning
all kinds of stories about NTAC.
Very interesting stuff.
Well, he can spin
all the theories
he wants,
just not here.
I'll make sure
he has a safe place to work.
I figured out what Promicin is.
That's the name they gave
the neurotransmitter,
right?
The one that gives the 4400
their abilities?
And if I can find
one 4400
that hasn't been exposed
to the inhibitor,
I think I can neutralize it.
Hey.
You scared me.
Why didn't you use
your key?
Oh, sorry.
My hands were full.
I brought you guys
some supplies.
You still like chocolate cherry?
That sounds great. Thank you.
Oh...
... you okay?
Yeah, just jumpy.
It's so quiet out here.
Yeah, a lot of places
have closed up for the season.
Oh, I thought that, uh...
maybe I could stay for
a little dinner or something.
You don't have to
get back home?
No, not really.
Carol's gone.
She found out
that you and I were talking.
Don't worry,
she doesn't know you're here,
but she got mad.
Brian, I'm sorry.
She'll stay away
for a few nights.
I'll stay on the couch
for a while...
but in the meantime,
Heidi's staying with a friend,
and I figured,
why eat alone?
Sure,
but I hope
you're not expecting much.
I haven't made pot roast
in a while.
You know, Lily,
the truth is...
I never
should have married Carol
in the first place.
What are you doing, Brian?
Come on.
I'm alone.
You're alone.
You and Richard aren't happy.
That's not true.
We could have it back, Lily.
Don't, brian.
Why are you
fighting it?
Brian, stop it!
Let me go!
I don't want to hurt you, Lily!
Stop it!
You little bitch.
Hello?
Lily?
Are you okay?
Brian?
Yeah, I was going to
bring by some food.
Don't.
Something's not right here.
I haven't heard
from the safe house
in wheeling
for a day.
We have to assume
it's been compromised.
That's the third one
that's gone silent.
They're picking us off
one by one.
We might want to think
about fighting back.
We can do that, Richard.
We certainly have 4400s
that can do some damage,
but once
we take that step,
there's no turning back.
Excuse me,
but shouldn't there be
bars on these windows?
The point is
to be unobtrusive,
Dr. Burkhoff.
Well, this seems
a little lax to me.
Most of you are 4400s.
I'm a collaborator.
You know what they do
to collaborators?
We need to get him working.
It calms him down considerably.
We cleared out a room for you.
Anything you need,
just let us know.
What I need is a clean 4400,
one that hasn't been exposed
to the inhibitor.
I don't guess
you've got one of those, do you?
Actually, I might.
20 years,
I've never seen you pour a drink
on government property.
I never supervised a round-up
of innocent citizens before.
Conscience bothering you,
Dennis?
Hell, yes...
... it is...
... and given the circumstances,
I'd say that's a good sign...
... but I'm trying to focus
on my job, Tom...
... and I need the same from you.
But sometimes when you...
you look for one thing,
you...
you learn something else.
You know how it is, Dennis.
I know exactly what you mean.
I've learned some things
myself.
Open it.
Knowledge is a burden, huh, Tom?
Did you think
that I would release Kyle
from quarantine
and not keep an eye on him?
Why didn't you stop this?
Because I didn't know
exactly what Kyle
was going to do.
I just sort of let the future
play out.
Isn't that what
you're always talking about?
You set up Roy Marsden.
That was my gift to you, Tom.
Would you rather
I just turn these over
to my bosses?
I would rather
you be the friend...
you be the Ryland
I worked with for 20 years.
I haven't changed.
I have a tough job,
and I'm doing my best,
and as your boss,
and as your friend,
I expect support.
Kyle hated quarantine.
I wonder what you think of prison?
They know.
NTAC knows
you shot Collier.
What? How?
They've known all along.
They let it happen.
I need you to be ready
to get out of here.
I'm going to call
Alana's friends.
You're sending me to Spain?
If they come after you,
I need you to be ready
to leave right away.
Did you hear Roy Marsden's
being sent to jail for life?
They set him up.
But if I run...
... just one thing at a time, Kyle.
Let me worry about you,
then I will deal with Marsden.
So you want me
to start packing?
Yeah, Kyle!
Aren't you hearing me?
He committed suicide?
I know that Max was under
a lot of strain, but...
He had
all those people's lives
in his hands.
Maia's...
I know,
but Dr. Pinero's been
Hudson's number two
from the very beginning.
He knows everything
that Hudson knew.
We're still going to
beat this thing.
Good morning, Tom.
Nina.
Here.
I grabbed this
out of your mail cubby.
Did you hear
about Hudson?
Yeah.
You okay?
They're calling it
a suicide.
What are you calling it?
Tom, look at this.
It's from Max.
"Firewall memo".
What is that?
I don't know.
Why are you doing this,
Isabelle?
Mommy needs to know.
I brought you here
so we could be safe.
Don't you want that?
Lily, what's going on
out here?
You okay?
No. Go away!
I told you not to come here!
That's why I'm here.
Lily, please, let me in.
How do I know you're real?
What are you
talking about?
Of course I'm real.
Did Carol leave you?
Why would she leave me?
Lily, I'm coming in,
okay?
No. No!
No!
Lily... whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.
Lily...
put down the knife. Please.
I just came
to check on you guys,
make sure
you were okay.
Look, it's me.
Brian.
Put the knife down.
Lily, we're all going to die.
Is that what you want?
No!
Stop it, Isabelle!
Lily, I heard screaming.
What is going on?
Brian...
if you're real,
you've got to get me out.
Isabelle
doesn't want to be here.
Firewall...
it's a program,
a safety net.
That's how
you keep viruses
off your hard drive.
Okay, did you ever see a memo
with the word "firewall"
written in the subject line?
No, but I don't read
most of the memos
that circulate
around here anyway.
Look, how long
are you guys
going to be
working in here?
What, are they painting
your offices?
We need a little privacy, okay?
Tom, this memo,
whatever it is,
I doubt it ever went out
on a general distribution,
and every copy probably went
through the shredder
months ago.
So if there's no hard copy,
and if Marco is the only one
we even trust
to even
talk about it with,
then we're at a dead end.
We could always
march into Ryland's office
and ask him about it.
The guy does know memos.
When he was working here,
I must have thrown away,
like, 15 every day.
More like 20.
He liked to
keep his keyboard burning.
Who, Ryland?
Yeah.
He didn't type.
He used to
call me in sometimes
when he froze up
his computer.
Hunt-and-peck city.
Took him 10 minutes
to type in an email address.
Ryland dictated everything
to his secretary.
She had "L" level
security clearance.
Look.
"D.R. /J.O."
Everything says
"D.R. /J.O."
"D.R.", Dennis Ryland.
And "J.O." is Jane Orman.
She worked for him
for 22 years.
Did she stay in Seattle?
Say hi for me.
Lily.
You came back.
Are you all right?
I thought I was doing
the smart thing,
but Isabelle...
What happened?
She just wanted to be with you,
and this place...
I don't know.
Hey.
Did you miss daddy?
Yeah?
Well,
he missed you.
Both of you.
Listen, I'm, uh...
I'm going to take off.
Brian...
thank you...
for everything.
Hey, uh...
... do me a favor...
... forget this address...
... forget about all of us...
... and I'll forget...
... you drove off with my wife...
... in the middle of the night.
Good luck, Lil.
Hey, I've been
calling you all day.
There's a guy here
who thinks that Isabelle...
... excuse me.
Didn't anyone hear
that car pull up...
Is that her?
I think
there's somebody here
who wants to meet you.
This is Isabelle.
What are we
supposed to say?
"You know that
massive conspiracy
to suppress the abilities
of the 4400?
We were just kind of hoping
you would fill us in
on the particulars".
Yeah,
"And don't be nervous,
but we had to shake
a government tail
on the way here to do it".
Yeah, sounds
like a start.
Tom Baldwin.
Long time, Jane.
Do you remember my partner,
Diana Skouris?
Of course.
Yeah. Hi.
I always wondered
who would show up.
I should have figured
it'd be the two of you.
You're here about firewall,
right?
The inhibitor
hasn't been tested.
It is not ready.
One of the 4400
is a serial killer
who was using,
I don't know,
some kind
of mind control
to get people
to commit murder.
The inhibitor's ready.
This is wrong, Dennis.
We are beyond
right and wrong here!
There's no precedent for this.
Now, D.C.'s been advised
of the operation.
It's been approved
at the highest level.
There is nothing further
to discuss, is there?
I am not doing this.
I took it home with me
that night.
The next day,
I put in my notice.
I mean, you have to understand,
for two decades,
I thought that Dennis Ryland
was the finest man I ever met,
and after I read this,
I couldn't work for him anymore.
I kept telling myself
I should send it somewhere...
... the newspapers, or...
... I don't know...
... but the names
that signed off
on this...
... I was just a secretary.
What could I do
against those names?
It's all here.
Did you see the names?
When Maia said,
"mommy's bosses are
going to be punished",
I had no idea she meant
all the way up
the chain of command.
We can't go public yet.
What?
We can't go public yet.
Listen, the faster
this gets exposed,
the better it is
for Maia, Alana, Shawn...
... all of them.
No more secrets.
No more relying
on the people who did this
to find a cure.
At the very least,
they're going to
have to rescind
the quarantine order.
Diana,
Ryland's got something on me.
Ryland?
This entire memo
is over his signature.
What could he possibly
have over you?
He knows
Kyle killed Jordan Collier.
What?
That night on Highland Beach,
they put someone inside of him,
or some program...
... I don't know...
directing his actions,
and Ryland has evidence.
I'm sorry, Tom,
but I can't just sit on this!
Maia's getting sicker!
Just give me one hour, Diana.
Just one hour.
Please.
Stop saying that.
It's not okay, Kyle.
If I go through
with this,
they're going to
come after you,
and it doesn't matter
if you're in Spain
or Siberia.
I know, but with all those lives
at stake,
you have to do it.
Okay, I'm taking you
to the airport.
Dad...
I'm not going anywhere.
This actually makes it easier.
I didn't know
how I was going to tell you.
Tell me what?
I can't live like this anymore.
I can't live
knowing that guy is in jail.
I go through every day
trying to pretend
it's all normal,
but it's just a cover-up.
I can't let you do it, Kyle.
Marsden shot at me.
He, uh...
he shot at other cops too.
Even if you confess, Kyle,
he is still going to jail.
You try to bury stuff like this,
it changes you.
Look what it did
to your boss.
Ryland used to be your friend.
It's over, dad.
No more lies.
I can't do it anymore.
I just can't do it.
Okay? You can't stop me.
Okay?
Don't you do anything
until I get back.
You hear me?
This is the right thing,
the heroic thing,
and being a hero
comes with some perks.
You tell me
what I need to know,
I'll see that
you're transferred
to a private
quarantine facility
this afternoon.
You can
walk the grounds,
you can choose
your own meals...
what's wrong with that?
139 Lebanon Street.
That's where
they told me to go.
The inhibitor
is piggybacking
on glucose.
It enters the brain
through facilitated
diffusion.
It's a binding protein.
That's how
they did it...
I'll take your word for it.
But this serum
has pure Promicin in it.
It can neutralize the charge.
The inhibitor won't be able
to cross membranes anymore.
We can flush it
out of their systems.
So once it's gone,
the disease goes away?
Please.
Stop saying "disease".
For the last time,
it's a side effect.
Remove the inhibitor,
the immune system functions.
It'll happen
virtually instantly.
So this substance...
Promicin.
It's what makes you people
unique.
How did you get it
out of my daughter?
She has trace amounts of it
in her bloodstream.
Before the inhibitor,
you all did.
That's how they found it...
... in the first place...
... but...
... she's an infant.
I could only draw
enough blood...
to make one shot.
If you can get that
into quarantine,
one shot might be all you need.
Nina, where's Ryland?
A 4400 gave up
the Seattle safe house.
They're on their way
to take it down.
Excuse me.
Please don't shoot.
Dr. Burkhoff,
why would we shoot you?
I have no idea,
but I'm feeling
a little insecure right now.
I brought something
for you.
Whatever you do, don't drop it.
Everybody in this house
is subject
to quarantine and arrest
under emergency order 74.
You have five minutes
to come out peacefully.
If not,
we'll come in and get you.
There's an army out there.
Ryland!
Call it off.
It's over.
Quarantine. Everything.
Agent Baldwin
is obstructing justice.
Arrest him.
I don't think so,
Dennis.
I know about firewall.
Keep your weapon on him.
You're really willing
to give up your son?
Kyle's turning himself in.
He can't live with the cover-up.
When I wrote that memo,
we had no idea where
the 4400 were from
or why they were
brought back.
Dr. Hudson
gave me information.
I acted on it, Tom.
If you were in my chair,
you'd have done the same thing.
Hi.
I've got some
medicine for you.
To be honest with you,
I'd rather be giving this
to Maia,
but a crazy neuroscientist
told me
that that was not
the right thing to do,
so if you don't mind
holding still
for a minute...
you saw Orson Bailey
up close and personal.
Oliver Knox.
You know what these people
were capable of.
Hell, I attached your reports
to the memo
when I sent it to D.C.
But we learned better, Dennis.
Highland Beach?
"Save the future"?
Heartfelt message, Tom,
and while they were
giving it to you,
they were
programming your son
to commit murder.
Does that sound to you
like they were
guiding us toward eden?
I don't know,
but I sure as hell
don't want to go
where you're taking me.
Goddammit, Tom!
What does it even mean,
"save the future"?
Save the future how?
Kill us all?
Start over
with a smaller,
more evolved
population?
Is that an outcome
you can live with?
What can you
live with, Dennis?
Was Max Hudson really a suicide,
or did you pull
that little string too?
And what about me,
Dennis?
Because if you're
holding on to any hope
of keeping this covered up,
you're going to have to start
by putting me in the ground
right here and right now.
Tom, you're reducing
the fate of the planet
to a question
of your personal faith.
Without the inhibitor program,
who the hell knows
what'll happen?
Who the hell ever knows?
Very wise.
Pithy.
But if the world
turns out to be a place
of unchecked
4400 abilities,
I hope we don't live
to regret it.
Stand down!
We're done here.
You can all go home now.
Thomas.
Alana.
Alana.
What happened here?
A miracle.
Welcome home, baby.
Home...
I never even unpacked.
We'll take care of that
right now.
Where's Kyle?
I can't wait
to see him.
Yeah, I told him
you were coming home.
Hey, Kyle!
We're back!
Hey, Kyle.
Man, I never thought
I was going
to see you again.
You're okay, right?
I feel like I did
15 keg stands last night,
but yeah,
pretty much.
We all are.
Dr. Burkhoff
took blood samples
from the people that I healed.
Every sample he gets
cures someone else, so...
hey, you guys
kind of lucked out, huh?
"Lucked out"?
There's 23 of us dead,
and they don't even have
a final count yet.
I don't think that was
part of the plan,
you know?
That's not why
they brought us back.
This whole idea
that there's some kind
of plan...
I don't know.
I wish
I could believe that.
Just trust me when I say
that there's a plan,
it's important,
and every 4400 is a part of it.
Shawn...
I killed Jordan Collier.
What?
I bought a rifle,
I went up on that roof,
took out two government agents,
and then I shot him.
Remember
when I was in trouble?
Losing chunks of time?
That's what I was doing.
Planning out an assassination.
Why?
You think I know?
There's something inside me,
Shawn...
or someone.
It takes over.
Those people
who took you?
If they have a plan,
it includes
me killing Jordan Collier.
That's not true, Kyle!
Then why did they
make me do it?
Why did they
ruin my life?
I'm about
to go to prison
for the people
you worship.
You murdered Jordan?
I didn't mean...
I didn't even know
what I was doing, Shawn.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Kyle...
Stop... Shawn...
what are you doing?
Stop it.
You're killing me.
Shawn...
I'm freeing you.
Freeing.
Freeing...
Just hold on.
It's working.
Hold on.
I'm going to get it out of you.
Just hold on.
Hold on, Kyle. It's working.
You really
didn't have to do this,
you know.
Actually...
I really think I needed to.
What?
Well, you're supposed to say,
"I wanted to".
Yeah.
Don't push your luck.
Whoa.
Uh, looks like they're talking
about charging these people
with murder.
Ryland. The whole crew.
Looks like
mommy's going to get
a whole bunch of new bosses.
Well, I hope they go away
for a very long time.
I'll be in the front row
at the hearings.
Guess I have to buy a suit.
I'm going to be
sitting next to you
until the whole thing
is over.
Nothing's over.
It's just starting.
Sweetie,
what are you talking about?
What's starting?
The war.
Kyle...
I'm ready.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I'll come with you.
Isabelle?
Isabelle?
Isabelle?
Hello, Shawn.
I'm Isabelle.
<i>sync by 1000fr</i>
<i>We're not a threat.</i>
<i>We're salvation.</i>
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> the 4400...
[jarvis]: What,
so navarro was really
some kind
of mind-reader?
I believe "telepath"
is the word you're looking for.
Just concentrate
on what you want
to ask me
and i'll hear you.
The guy definitely knew
what we were thinking.
[Jarvis]: I could think of a few
practical applications for it.
[Collier]: You should have
come to me first.
I'd have treated you better
than they ever will.
<i>We're at war here.</i>
<i>Don't pick the losing side.</i>
There's a synthetic substance
present in the blood
of every 4400,
and they call it
"promicin inhibitor."
But ntac's been
studying the 4400
ever since
they got back.
They should have
known about this...
they do know.
I was ordered to work on a drug
to suppress
the production of promicin.
Once i synthesized
the inhibitor,
we gave it
to every 4400.
If it comes down
to a choice
between the safety
of the american people
and the welfare
of the 4400,
tom...
that's no choice at all.
If you're holding on
to any hope
of keeping this covered up,
you're going to have to start
by putting me in the ground
right here and right now.
[Marco]:
Every male in this building
has got a gallon of adrenaline
coursing through his veins
right now,
and most of them are armed.
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified
government facility
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.
I wasn't pregnant
when i was abducted,
but i was when i got back.
[Richard]: You've seen
what she's capable of,
what she can do
when she feels threatened.
Did you know
isabelle has connections
between the right and left
hemispheres of her brain
that have never
been seen before?
[Matthew]: You are the stewards
of the future.
Your daughter
is the rosetta stone
for understanding
what happened to the 4400.
Isabelle...
isabelle!
Hello, shawn.
I'm isabelle.
The world has changed.
Everything is different now.
The promicin inhibitor program
was an international effort.
Its goal
was to prevent the coming
of a world
dominated by a tiny fraction
of the population.
In short,
we were doing
everything we could
to prevent the 4400
from developing
extrahuman capabilities.
We believed that,
without the inhibitor program,
<i>these abilities would show up</i>
<i>in virtually</i>
<i>every single one of the 4400.</i>
<i>I don't think i need to explain</i>
<i>to this committee</i>
<i>why that would be</i>
<i>something less</i>
<i>than a best-case scenario.</i>
<i>Overnight, normal human beings</i>
<i>like you and i</i>
<i>and all the institutions</i>
<i>we've come to rely on</i>
<i>would be obsolete.</i>
<i>The program wasn't perfect.</i>
<i>People got sick.</i>
<i>Some died.</i>
<i>That was not our intent.</i>
<i>But now it's gone,</i>
<i>and the future</i>
<i>that we were trying to prevent</i>
<i>is here,</i>
<i>and we are not ready.</i>
<i>I believe it comes down</i>
<i>to a question of power.</i>
<i>Who is going to hold it?</i>
<i>Us...</i>
<i>or them?</i>
Because, believe me...
it's going to come down...
to us against them.
Shawn, you're not
making any sense.
Just tell me what's
wrong with isabelle.
I told you,
i can't explain.
Is she sick?
Is she hurt?
You'll see
for yourself.
Dad.
W-who the hell is this?
Where's isabelle?
I am your daughter.
I'm isabelle.
L-i don't get it.
Something happened.
I... i changed.
I don't know how.
She just
walked in here.
She knew my name.
She seems to know
about you and lily.
I don't know
what game
you're playing here,
and i don't care.
Richard... richard.
Lily.
Lily!
Lily?
Is isabelle with you?
Lily...
lily.
Are you all right?
Oh, richard,
i must have fainted.
Is isabelle with you?
Who are you?
Where's my wife?
Richard, what are you
talking about?
I'm lily, your wife.
Why are you
looking at me like...
oh, my god.
Ma'am, i don't know who you are.
Oh...
oh, my god.
No!
Your blood pressure
is elevated...
but i suppose
that's to be expected.
Heart, lungs, reflexes...
all within the normal range.
Doctor,
you call this normal?
Richard, i want
to see isabelle.
Where is my daughter?
She's right outside.
I'll bring her in
in a minute.
I realize
how alarming this must be,
but at least
you can take some solace
in the fact that your wife
is a perfectly healthy
older woman.
If i had to guess,
i'd say she's about 75.
I'm 29...
and i don't understand.
Please help me understand.
How could
this happen?
Maybe it's a reaction
to being taken off
the promicin inhibitor,
but truthfully,
i don't know.
There is a condition
called progeria.
It's associated
with rapid aging.
So this kind of thing
has happened before?
Mr. Tyler...
when your wife fainted
this morning,
she was a young woman.
When she woke up
less than a minute later,
she was 50 years older.
I can guarantee you...
this is a first.
Excuse me.
Are you okay, dr. Burkhoff?
Fine.
Not enough sleep, that's all.
Research.
Well, what do we do now?
Is there any way
to reverse this?
I wish i knew.
I need...
to do some thinking.
Are you my mother?
Isabelle?
Every day,
the 4400 are changing
and getting stronger.
Instead of mobilizing
to meet this challenge,
we're wringing our hands
and trying to determine
who knew what when.
I will save this committee
the trouble and expense
of a long investigation.
The inhibitor program
was my idea.
I was proud to lead it.
The men on this board
were simply following my orders.
If there's blame
to be assigned,
it's mine.
Mine alone.
Yeah, i know kyle
doesn't want to see me.
Is there some way
we can force him to?
I'm his father.
I want to know
how he's doing.
Look, i realize you're trying,
but it'll be months
before he goes to trial.
I mean, you really think
people are going to let ryland
position himself
as some kind
of patriotic martyr?
The man headed a conspiracy
that caused 28 deaths.
Well, he says
it was accidental.
A significant percentage
of this country
believes him.
Try "overwhelming."
You guys listened
to talk radio lately?
The calls
are like 90% in his favor.
You can buy a "free
dennis ryland" t-shirt
within a block of here.
Maybe they should put him up
for the nobel peace prize.
Just tell him
i need to see him.
We don't have to talk
about the case.
I just have to see my son.
Just ask him one more time,
okay?
And...
and tell him we love him.
Give him some time, thomas.
Kyle needs to live
with his choice for a while.
We're back.
Tom...
break's over.
Ladies and gentlemen,
i'd like to call the proceedings
to order.
Everyone just
take your seats.
We can get started.
Members of the press,
i was including you
in that "ladies
and gentlemen"
designation.
Thank you.
Mr. Ryland,
i'd like to pick up
the questioning
where we left off.
You insist that you alone
gave the go-ahead
for the promicin inhibitor
program.
Is that right, sir?
Yes, sir.
It was my program all the way.
So this committee
is to understand
that your department
was able to plan and implement
an international
conspiracy
without some
cabinet-level approval?
That's correct.
I was given
a broad mandate
in my duties
as head of ntac.
I felt that the project fell
within that mandate,
so there was no need
to seek outside approval.
Excuse us, everybody.
Did you hear that?
Well, yeah, the microphones
went haywire.
No, no, not that.
Something else.
Just set that
approval issue
to the side
for the moment.
Did you ever
discuss the project
with anyone outside of ntac?
I mean, someone
somewhere
must have taken an interest
in what you people
were doing over there.
[Whispering]
It's a simple question,
mr. Ryland.
Surely it can't be
that difficult to answer.
If i could have your attention
up here, mr. Ryland...
[gasping]
Security!
Stop that man!
Get some protection
around ryland.
Stay here. I'll be right back.
We need
an ambulance!
Stand back, please!
Back! Get back!
Hey!
Stop! T.j.!
Someone get these photographers
out of here.
Stay over there.
I don't understand what i did.
Would somebody please
tell to me what i just did?
Hang on, dennis.
The ambulance
is coming.
Yeah, it was her.
The blood we picked up
at the scene
matches the dna
in our records.
That was t.j. Kim
running from the courthouse.
When she hit this place,
t.j. Drove
every man in the building
into a homicidal rage.
Now it sounds
like she just zapped one guy.
She's learning
to control what she can do.
They all are.
Ever since we took them
off the inhibitor,
they're either
developing abilities
or they're refining
the ones that they've got.
So they are getting
more dangerous.
I guess ryland
was right.
I'll be sure to mention that
to my daughter.
Save the point-
counterpoint.
At the moment,
we've been tasked
with two jobs...
we track down t.j. Kim.
What's the second job?
We are to protect
ryland's co-conspirators
from any
further reprisals.
So we arrest them,
and now we're their bodyguards?
The entire country just saw
a 4400 turn a government hearing
into her own personal
slasher film.
If t.j.
Gets to ryland again...
or any of them...
before we can
bring her in,
people are going to
start to wonder
if the united states government
is capable
of protecting its citizens,
and that's the beginning
of chaos.
Back to work, please.
Tom...
in case you're wondering,
dennis is still
in surgery.
They say that it is
touch and go.
[Shawn]: It's okay.
Give me your hands.
Try and relax.
Relax.
Is it better?
Much better.
For now.
When this thing first came on,
it was bad,
but at least she was healthy.
Now she's had diabetes,
emphysema...
it seems like every day
there's something new.
I'll come help her every day.
Listen,
we've got everyone
working on this.
We're going to
figure it out.
Is my mother okay?
Uh, yeah.
She had a little problem.
Shawn fixed it.
It's all
in the wrists.
Can i see her?
Please?
Mom?
[Weakly]: Isabelle.
Come here.
Is there anything i can do?
No, i'm... i'm fine.
Really.
Sit down.
You were such a beautiful baby.
I used to hold you
all day long.
I knew exactly
what you were feeling.
What you wanted.
We were so close.
I'm sorry for
growing up so fast.
I didn't mean to.
I didn't want to.
Neither did i.
The crazy thing is
i keep thinking
about patty.
Ryland's wife.
I feel like i should
call her or something,
help her through this.
Maybe you should.
You and ryland
were friends
for a long time.
It's okay to be conflicted.
Well, ryland's little experiment
almost got you killed.
Shawn, too.
The guy knew
that kyle was stalking
jordan collier
and he did nothing.
I'd say that trumps friendship.
You have so much
on your mind.
Kyle, ryland, the 4400s...
i need to get you
away from here.
Away from your problems.
Yeah, well, that sounds nice,
but i can't go anywhere.
I'm starting an investigation
in the morning.
What if i told you
i could take you away
between now and then?
My ability.
Since i'm off the inhibitor...
i think i can control it now.
What, you mean you want to...
you want to take me
into another dream world?
Alternate reality...
i don't even know
what to call it.
Call it a vacation.
A week, a year...
as long as we want.
All that in the space
of a few moments.
Should we try it?
Right here?
Now?
Well, what...
what do we do?
We're already doing it.
There's no one
on the beach.
It's all ours, thomas.
So's the hotel.
And we can stay here
for as long as we like.
There is no jet lag.
That sounds perfect.
It feels perfect, too.
The door's open. Come in.
Whoa.
What? What is it?
Uh, you're naked.
I'm more comfortable
this way.
I haven't really
gotten used to them.
Clothes.
I have a bathrobe.
Is this better?
Almost.
I never met anybody
that read the encyclopedia
from cover to cover before.
Oh, i'm not finished.
We just delivered those to you
yesterday.
Okay, you're a fast reader.
That's really cool.
Um, listen,
they're looking for you
down in the labs.
You're like an hour late.
They sent you to get me?
Aren't you in charge?
Well, yeah,
more or less.
You know,
i go where i'm needed.
They were scared of me,
weren't they?
Pretty much.
That's all right.
I think even my parents
are frightened of me.
I don't think your mom and dad
are scared of you.
I think they're just confused.
I don't blame them.
It's mostly how i feel, too.
I...
don't understand
what happened to me.
I don't understand what happened
to my mother.
And i'm trying to read
and learn things, but...
mostly, i just...
i still feel lost.
See, now you sound
like a real 4400.
But i'm not a 4400...
not like my mother
and father...
or you.
Looks like i'm going to live.
Sorry to disappoint you, tom.
Why'd you ask me to see me,
dennis?
I hear
that you and skouris
are in charge
of the investigation.
Yeah, we know who did it.
We'll find her.
T.j. Kim attacked thuildx weeks ago.
No one's
tracked her down yet.
We got a little sidetracked
cleaning up your mess, dennis.
Did you ever think
that maybe she has help?
Other 4400s
who feel the same way
about the government
she does?
When we catch her,
we'll ask.
Will you?
I want to make sure
you're going to
take this thing
as far as it goes, tom,
the same way you did
when you came after me...
and i want my people
protected.
They were acting
under my orders.
They're under guard.
So was the courthouse
when kim attacked.
I'd feel better
if you brought them in.
We offered sanctuary
to every single conspirator.
There were no takers.
<i>I guess no one</i>
<i>wanted to cooperate</i>
<i>with the organization</i>
<i>that was working</i>
<i>to put you in prison.</i>
<i>We had to fight</i>
<i>just to get them</i>
<i>to let us post agents</i>
<i>outside their houses.</i>
Crockett!
You ready
to go for a walk, boy?
Come on, crockett.
Let's go.
They wanted no part of us.
They all seemed confident
that t.j. Kim
was acting alone.
Crockett?
What's wrong?
It's me.
[Jarvis]: This arrived
15 minutes ago.
[Distorted voice]:
<i>This is a message</i>
<i>from the nova group.</i>
<i>We are the defensive wing</i>
<i>of the 4400.</i>
<i>Today, the world has seen</i>
<i>what happens to those</i>
<i>who try to harm us.</i>
<i>A second demonstration</i>
<i>of our capabilities</i>
<i>is planned for october 19th.</i>
<i>A new era dawns.</i>
Defensive wing, huh?
What happens when they
decide to play offense?
I guess we find out
in five days.
They didn't even say
what they want.
No demands,
no room for compromise.
We don't even know
how many 4400s
are in this nova group.
We couldn't even handle one
when she walked in
and attacked the place.
Now there's a whole team
of assassins out there,
all with abilities?
They've got someone
who can kill you
by lowering your
body temperature.
Don't forget
the beastmaster.
What?
That dog got pissed off
pretty quick.
Well, i've been
all over the files,
and none of these abilities
have been registered
with us.
They're off
the inhibitor now.
We can't even pretend
to have
a comprehensive list
of what these people
can do.
Is anyone feeling...
a little overmatched here?
You two remember gary navarro?
Hey, gary.
Been a while.
You're right, baldwin.
I do think you two sold me out.
It really bothered me
for a while,
but now i understand it's just
standard operating procedure.
Well, i guess
that mind reading thing
is working
pretty well, huh?
Better than ever, actually.
Gary's telepathic abilities
have been very useful
to the national security agency.
They have agreed
to let us borrow him
while we investigate
the nova group.
So you're clear
on what we're doing here?
You want to use a 4400
to track down other 4400s.
Do you have a problem
with that?
Not at all.
It won't be my first time.
So...
can we get started?
Never heard of the nova group.
Between ntac
and this place,
but i trust you realize
how serious this is.
Believe me, if i knew anything,
i would tell you.
Well, do you mind
if the three of us
walk around the place,
talk to some people?
You and your pet mind-reader?
No, i can't
let you do that.
These people haven't
done anything wrong,
and i won't let you
invade their privacy,
and i actually can't believe
that you brought
this guy here again.
How much do they pay you
to spy on your own kind?
Getting
a clear signal?
You see anything you like
up there?
As far as i can tell,
he's not hiding anything.
I have a lot of work to do.
If i hear anything,
i'll give you a call.
For now,
that's the best i can do.
Sorry about my nephew.
Why?
Well, he was kind of rude
back there.
I get that kind
of stuff a lot.
I don't take it personally.
Do you mind
if i ask you...
you've sort of implied
that you've pursued 4400s
in the past.
What exactly do you do
for the nsa?
Overseas stuff, mostly.
But, like, what?
Give me an example.
They fly me someplace.
I approach the subject,
find out what he's thinking,
and i tell the people
i work for,
who then fly me home,
where i live
comfortably.
What happens to the subject?
I don't ask.
That's good.
The neural pathway
comparisons
are particularly
illuminating.
Make sure
you understand them
before you move on.
Dr. Burkhoff,
i don't understand
any of this.
A bunch of her neurons
don't work anymore.
Every time one of hers
turns off,
one of mine turns on.
Exactly...
and what's true for neurons
is true for muscle fibers,
synaptic pathways...
there is a...
one-to-one
correspondence
between the amount you lost
and the amount you gained.
So all this is just a way
of saying i'm doing this to her?
The correlation
is too precise
to be random.
Your rapid aging
has caused her rapid aging.
How do we stop it?
Put me back to the way i was.
I'm afraid i can't.
So, what do we do about it?
There is a possibility
that if the aging agent
were eliminated
that lily
might be restored
to her normal self.
The aging agent?
He means me.
I'm killing you.
The only way
for you to live
is for me to die,
isn't that right?
Don't answer that,
dr. Burkhoff.
Thank you for your time.
We're done here.
Where are you going?
We're not discussing this.
Not now.
Not ever.
It's true, isn't it?
I think so.
But it's only a theory.
Guys, i went over this
six weeks ago
with the men in black.
Humor us.
I went on two dates
with t.j. Kim.
I cut it off.
Girl had a lot of baggage.
How long ago was that?
Uh, two months ago?
Look, if i'd known
there'd be government agents
showing up every other day
to ask me about her,
i would've taken notes,
hey, so listen...
all this stuff
about october 19th...
you guys think it's serious?
Like, should i be
getting out of town?
I don't think
that's the answer.
As far as we know,
you're as safe here
as anywhere else.
That kid was lying...
or at least he wasn't
telling you everything.
The whole time
you were talking to him,
he was thinking
about an address.
331 reynolds avenue.
Looks like it's clear.
Nobody's home.
Nobody's been for home
for a while, i'd say.
Look at this.
That's
the government report
on the return of the 4400.
I tried to
read this once.
Kind of dry.
Yeah.
Looks like someone
made it right through
to the end.
Wesley hauser.
Wesley hauser.
Wesley hauser.
Who the hell is wesley hauser?
[Jarvis]: Hauser was a marine.
Did two tours of duty
in vietnam.
He led protests against the war
after he got home in '72.
Disappeared in '75.
Once he got
out of quarantine,
he never checked
back in with us.
Guy's been living
off the grid
for almost two years.
Which means he never
went on the inhibitor,
so who knows
what he's capable of by now.
Hauser was disillusioned
with the government
before he disappeared,
and i wouldn't say
we've done much
to win him over
since he's been back.
When he was
in quarantine,
he was housed in barracks 3.
Same building as t.j. Kim.
An agitator.
An organizer.
A radical.
Sounds like we have
our second member
of the nova group.
[Telephone rings]
Baldwin.
You're kidding me.
All right. I know.
Put him through.
Says he's wesley hauser.
No way.
Yeah, hello.
<i>How'd you like my apartment?</i>
Well, to be honest,
it felt a little empty
without you there.
<i>I'm on a tight schedule.</i>
<i>Lot to do before next week.</i>
Sound like you have
interesting plans,
so why don't we get together
someplace,
talk them over?
<i>No more talking.</i>
<i>There's nothing to say.</i>
<i>Your time is ending.</i>
<i>Ours begins on october 19th.</i>
come on, let me go.
Why'd you run
when we asked you
about hauser, huh?
You two used to eat together
in quarantine.
We've got it on camera.
So?
The guy had
a lot of good war stories.
Doesn't make us best friends.
So why did you run?
Because when i see
ntac agents,
i run the other way.
You people
almost killed us all.
Can you blame me?
Turn around.
Turn around.
We done here?
Get out of here.
Call me sensitive,
but i felt like
saying to him,
"we exposed the inhibitor.
We saved your life."
You guys just
don't really get it,
do you?
It's not just
that guy.
Every 4400
we've talked to today,
they're scared of you,
or they
don't trust you,
or they hate you.
Look, i'm sorry,
but the days
when you could expect
friendly conversation
from these people,
they're gone.
You're the bad guys now.
Get used to it.
I'm just warning you,
motherhood's
no cakewalk.
Since when
are you an expert?
I'm only saying
she landed on twins.
Kind of a big
responsibility...
especially when
she's trying to get by
on a teacher's salary.
What are you
going to name them?
I don't really want
to play anymore.
Is that okay?
What's wrong, sweetheart?
Nothing, except...
i know marco's going to win,
i'm going to come second,
and you're going to end up alone
with no money.
Don't be jealous.
He's smarter than you,
but mom likes you better.
Uh...
So, uh, who's...
who's smarter than me?
Who knows?
I'm not even sure
she knows exactly.
You know, in some ways,
she was better off
on the promicin
inhibitor.
At least she wasn't overwhelmed
back then.
All she wants to do
is record what she sees
in those notebooks.
It's like some kind
of compulsion.
Well...
think about it
for a minute.
Every morning,
she wakes up and...
knows pretty much what's coming.
She's already lived
the whole day
once in her head,
and by the time
something
actually does happen,
it's like a rerun.
I hate watching reruns.
Yeah. Try living one.
Hey, what about kevin burkhoff?
Maybe he can
figure out a way
for maia to control her visions.
He is brilliant.
I don't say this
about many people,
but he is smarter than me.
I know you.
Well, of course you do.
It's diana skouris.
You work at ntac.
I'm not here on business.
I'm here
about my daughter maia.
The precog.
What about her?
She's still 10, right?
She's not 65 now, is she?
Interesting guess.
Kind of wide of the mark,
though.
Good.
Might as well come on in.
Thank you.
Oh, sorry
about the clutter.
I fired the maid last week.
She was always cleaning.
Excuse me.
So...
your daughter.
What's troubling her?
I'll let you do it.
I caused all this, right?
And getting rid of me
is the only way
to save my mother.
No...
that's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?
Shh.
No, it wasn't.
I don't want her
to die either,
so i'll let you do it.
I'll...
i'll even shut my eyes.
Isabelle...
i would never hurt you.
Why?
I don't understand.
It's the only way to save her.
We don't know that,
and i won't make a choice
between the two of you.
"Won't" or "can't"?
Sorry.
I don't mean
to invade anyone's space.
Oh, that's okay.
It's not my desk.
But it looks like you'll be here
for a while now, huh?
Assuming
this place is still standing
on october 20th,
yeah.
Maybe we should talk
to jarvis.
Get you a room
of your very own.
That's fine with me.
To tell you the truth,
i could use
a little bit of a buffer zone.
This problem you're having
with your daughter's...
precog ability?
I keep wanting
to give you my opinion,
but i don't want to intrude.
So you are...
listening to my thoughts.
You and baldwin.
I can't help it.
I try to tune you guys out,
but every now and then,
something leaks through.
I'll try to keep that in mind.
You said you had an opinion
about maia.
What is it?
When i first...
developed this thing of mine,
i was a basket case.
You saw me.
I truly thought
i was going insane,
so i fought against it,
and that just
made it worse.
I had to give in to it,
let it
take control of me,
and then, slowly,
i learned
how to take control of it.
Listen, your kid
stops fighting,
and eventually,
it'll become
like seeing or hearing
or any other sense.
She won't even
think about it.
It's just a part
of who she is.
That's how it worked
for me, anyway.
Thank you.
Diana.
We just got a call
from the seattle police.
Someone down there
read our apb.
They know exactly
where hauser is.
You guys are lucky,
actually.
In another day or two,
we would have buried him
in potter's field.
Buried who?
Him.
I always read the apb memos
when they circulate
in the police department.
Kind of a hobby.
Gets boring in here.
Anyway, there was
a description
of a regimental tattoo
on the memo for hauser.
82nd airborne.
"Death from above."
I remember it from a john doe
they brought in here
three weeks ago.
This guy drowned
in the harbor.
A lot of veterans
have that tattoo.
Do a lot of veterans
look exactly like
the mug shot you circulated?
Don't believe me?
Take a look
for yourselves.
Say hello
to wesley hauser.
Hauser died
two and a half weeks
before ryland was attacked.
Obviously, that wasn't him
on the phone the other day.
And that copy
of the 4400 report
with all his notes over it?
For all we know,
that could have been a plant.
Somebody wanted us distracted.
They deliberately
put us on the trail
of some phantom member
of the nova group.
I mean, how did we first
find out about hauser?
T.j.'s old boyfriend.
He gave us the address.
No, he was thinking it.
At least,
according to gary, he was.
Gary navarro
put us onto wesley hauser.
Get in.
You lied to me, daniel.
You never said anything
about killing people.
We were protecting you, shawn.
If we tell you in advance,
you're culpable.
[Woman groaning]
What is she doing here?
She's dying.
She needs your help.
I told you,
i don't want
anything more
to do with you.
The nova group
was supposed to protect us.
That's why i gave you money,
daniel.
That's why i gave you money.
Not to start
a terrorist organization!
We'll talk about your concerns
later.
She's got a stomach wound,
and it's infected.
She needs you right now,
or she's not
going to make it.
Shawn, she's a 4400.
If we don't
help each other,
what hope do we have?
Give me your hand.
What are you doing here?
You're awake.
Good.
It's important
that you know it was me.
I'm the guy who killed you.
[Monitor beeping]
[Man on radio]: <i>med post.</i>
<i>Do you have a 20</i>
<i>on gary navarro?</i>
Yeah, he just
walked by.
Why?
<i>Get him!</i>
Hey! Stop!
Go. I'll check on ryland.
He's seizing.
He's bradying down.
I need a crash cart
and ativan.
Find dr. Danoff.
Now!
Stay right there, gary.
Isabelle.
Isabelle!
Oh, god.
Somebody call an ambulance!
What's everybody
standing around for?
Somebody call an ambulance!
They're on
their way!
Somebody call an ambulance...
dad...
what am i?
[Daniel]:
<i>It's miraculous, shawn.</i>
I watch you
heal someone, and...
it makes me wonder
why they hate us so much.
They hate us
because you're
killing them, daniel.
They're afraid of us.
I can't blame them.
You make it sound
like we acted out of
some sort of blood lust.
These were precise,
tactical strikes, shawn,
and you
and every other 4400
are ultimately much safer
because of them.
You killed people.
That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.
I gave you money
to start a defensive arm
for the center
in case the government
ever came after us again.
It was a precaution.
And all we've done
is taken
precautionary measures.
Shawn, do you think
that because
their inhibitor program
was exposed
that the government's
just going to leave us in peace?
No, they know
we've gotten stronger,
which threatens
their hold on power,
which increases their need
to eliminate us.
So we strike first?
Is that it?
Is that what happens
on the 19th?
Look, shawn,
you do great work
at that center of yours.
You just focus on that.
I don't want to distract you.
Knowledge can be a burden.
And thanks
for helping t.j. Out.
You're a hero
to your own people.
Never forget that.
Yeah.
It did not work,
you know.
Ryland was o.d.'ing,
but the doctors
pulled him out of it.
He'll be awake
within a couple of hours.
Well, i'm sure
you're as disappointed as i am.
Don't worry.
We'll get him.
Let's talk about
wesley hauser.
You first met him
in quarantine.
I liked wes.
He was 10 kinds of crazy,
but his heart was
in the right place.
I guess he was bipolar
or something,
but he never
took medication.
After quarantine,
he lived on the streets.
I used to visit him
down at the docks.
You know, give him food,
a little money.
So when did you decide
to kill him?
Wes, he didn't need my help
with that.
He drank about
three bottles of mad dog a day.
One morning about a month ago,
i went down to see him, and...
i found him by the dumpster.
Dead.
And somewhere
in the middle
of your grieving process,
you figured he'd make
a handy decoy.
Hauser wouldn't
have minded.
Going back
to his marine corps days.
So when i found him,
i said a word or two
over his body,
and i pushed him
into elliott bay.
So how long have you been
working with this nova group?
Did someone approach you,
or was the whole thing
your idea?
Tell me...
you and this girlfriend
of yours...
is it like a role-playing thing
you get up to?
Or is she actually
taking you into these...
i don't know.
What do you call it?
Fantasy worlds?
Oh, and this guy marco...
does he know
that you're too...
embarrassed
to tell your partner
that you two have been dating?
Done showing off?
Why don't you tell us
what's going to happen
on october 19th?
I guess you're going to have to
find yourself another telepath.
Good luck with that.
So you got nothing out of him?
Well, he told us
about hauser,
but as far as
the nova goes,
it's going to take time
to break him down.
How much time?
He's a telepath.
He knows what
we're thinking.
A little longer
than usual.
Okay, so it's not easy,
but gary navarro
has a level-seven
security clearance.
We have to assume
that he's been using it
to funnel
national secrets
to the nova group.
We need to know what he knows.
Now.
He'll talk.
Gary's been
inside our heads
for a year.
I think i know how to
get inside of his.
Careful with this.
Matthew.
I didn't expect
to see you back
for a couple of weeks.
The nova group revised
my calendar for me.
Wiped it clean, actually.
It's difficult to lobby
on behalf of the 4400
when some of them
are boasting
about their body count.
I suppose.
How's lily?
Any improvement
since i left?
If anything,
she's getting worse.
Sorry to hear that.
Isabelle?
She tried
to kill herself
this morning.
She jumped off the roof.
A few minutes later,
she was walking around
like nothing happened.
I got to tell you,
matthew...
i'm not going to lie.
I'm really glad
you're back.
[Knock on door]
Hello, isabelle.
Hello. Who are you?
My name is matthew ross.
I work closely with shawn.
I'm an advisor
to the 4400.
May i come in?
I understand there was
an incident this morning.
You attempted...
to harm yourself.
I see.
You had no right to do that!
Don't you understand
who you are?
What you're here to do?
No...
well, i do.
I know everything about you,
isabelle.
I know why you're here,
and i know
what you're supposed to do.
Sit...
and i'll tell you
a story.
You'll like it.
It's about your past,
and it's about your future.
Over the last 60 years 4400 people
have been abducted
<font color="#ffff00">-=www.ydy.com/bbs=-
proudly presents</font>
All at once they were returned
<font color="#ffff00">sync:gagegao
-=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font>
With no memory of where they've been
They haven't aged a day
And some have returned with new abilities
All are trying to reconnect....
...with a life interrupted
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
What,so navarro was really some
kind of mind-reader?
I believe "telepath" is the
word you're looking for.
Just concentrate on what you want
to ask me and I'll hear you.
The guy definitely knew what we were thinking.
I could think of a few practical
applications for it.
You should have come to me first.
I'd have treated you better than they ever will.
We're at war here.
Don't pick the losing side.
There's a synthetic substance present
in the blood of every 4400,
and they call it "promicin inhibitor."
But ntac's been studying the 4400 ever
since they got back.
- They should have known about this--
- they do know.
I was ordered to work on a drug to
suppress the production of promicin.
Once I synthesized the inhibitor,
we gave it to every 4400.
If it comes down to a choice
between the safety
of the american people and the
welfare of the 4400,
tom...
that's no choice at all.
If you're holding on to any hope
of keeping this covered up,
you're going to have to start by putting
me in the ground right here and right now.
Every male in this building has
got a gallon of adrenaline
coursing through his veins right now,
and most of them are armed.
A 4400 nearly took down a fortified government
facility and walked away without breaking a sweat.
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.
You've seen what she's capable of,
what she can do when she feels threatened.
Did you know isabelle has connections
between the right and left
hemispheres of her brain that have
never been seen before?
You are the stewards of the future.
Your daughter is the rosetta stone
for understanding wh happened to the 4400.
Isabelle...
isabelle!
Hello,shawn.
I'm isabelle.
<font color="#ffff00">4400
Season 03 Episode 01-02</font>
The world has changed.
Everything is different now.
The promicin inhibitor program was
an international effort.
Its goal was to prevent the coming of a world
dominated by a tiny fraction of the population.
In short,we were doing everything we could
to prevent the 4400 from developing
extrahuman capabilities.
We believed that,without the inhibitor program,
these abilities would show up
in virtually every single one of the 4400.
I don't think I need to explain to ts committee
why that would be something
less than a best-case scenario.
Overnight,normal human beings like you and i
and all the institutions we've
come to rely on would be obsolete.
The program wasn't perfect.
People got sick.Some died.
That was not our intent.
But now it's gone,
and the future that we were
trying to prevent is here,
and we are not ready.
I believe it comes down to
a question of power.
Who is going to hold it?
Us...or them?
Because,believe me...
it's going to co down...
to us against them.
THREE WEEKS EARLIER
Shawn,you're not making any sense.
Just tell me what's wrong with isabelle.
I told you,I can't explain.
Is she sick?
Is she hurt?
You'll see for yourself.
Dad.
W-who the hell is this?
Where's isabelle?
I am your daughter.
I'm isabelle.
- I-I don't get it.
- It's not a joke.
Something happened.I... I changed.
I don't know how.
She just walked in here.She knew my name.
She seems to know about you and lily.
Stop.
I don't know what game you're playing here,
and I don't care.
Richard... richard.
Lily.
Lily!
Lily?
Is isabelle with you?
Lily--
lily.
Are you all right?
Oh,richard,I must have fainted.
Is isabelle with you?
Who are you?
Where's my wife?
Richard,what are you talking about?
I'm lily,your wife.
Why are you looking at me like--
oh,my god.
Ma'am,I don't know who you are.
oh,my god.
No!
Your blood pressure is elevated...
but I suppose that's to be expected.
Heart,lungs,reflexes...
all within the normal range.
- Doctor,you call this normal?
- Richard,I want to see isabelle.
- Where is my daughter?
- She's right outside.
I'll bring her in in a minute.
I realize how alarming this must be,
but at least you can take some
solace in the fact that
your wife is a perfectly
healthy older woman.
If I had to guess,I'd say she's about 75.
I'm 29...
and I don't understand.
Please help me understand.
How could this happen?
Maybe it's a reaction to being
taken off the promicin inhibitor,
but truthfully,I don't know.
There is a condition called progeria.
It's associated with rapid aging.
So this kind of thing has happened before?
Mr. Tyler...
when your wife fainted this morning,
she was a young woman.
When she woke up less than a minute later,
she was 50 years older.
I can guarantee you...
this is a first.
Excuse me.
- Are you okay,dr. Burkhoff?
- Fine.
Not enough sleep,that's all.
Research.
Well,what do we do now?
Is there any way to reverse this?
I wish I knew.
I need...
to do some thinking.
Are you my mother?
Isabelle?
PRESENT DAY
we're wringing our hands and trying
to determine who knew what when.
I will save this committee the trouble
and expense of a long investigation.
The inhibitor program was my idea.
I was proud to lead it.
The men on this board were simply
following my orders.
If there's blame to be assigned,it's mine.
Mine alone.
Yeah,I know kyle doesn't want to see me.
Is there some way we can force him to?
I'm his father.
I want to know how he's doing.
Look,I realize you're trying,
but it'll be months before he goes to trial.
xxxxxxxxxx
I mean,you really think people
are going to let ryland
position himself as some kind of
patriotic martyr?
The man headed a conspiracy that
caused 28 deaths.
Well,he says it was accidental.
A significant percentage of this
country believes him.
Try "overwhelming."
You guys listened to talk radio lately?
The calls are like 90% in his favor.
You can buy a "free dennis ryland"
t-shirt within a block of here.
Maybe they should put him up for
the nobel peace prize.
Just tell him i need to see him.
We don't have to talk about the case.
I just have to see my son.
Just ask him one more time,okay?
and tell him we love him.
Give him some time,thomas.
Kyle needs to live with his choice
for a while.
We're back.
Tom...
break's over.
Ladies and gentlemen,I'd like to
call the proceedings to order.
Everyone just take your seats.
We can get started.
Members of the press,I was including you in that
"ladies and gentlemen" designation.Thank you.
Mr. Ryland,
I'd like to pick up the questioning
where we left off.
You insist that you alone gave the go-ahead for
the promicin inhibitor program.Is that right,sir?
Yes,sir.
It was my program all the way.
So this committee is to understand that
your department was able to plan
and implement an international conspiracy
without some cabinet-level approval?
That's correct.I was given a broad mandate
in my duties as head of ntac.
I felt that the project fell within that mandate,
so there was no need to seek outside approval.
Excuse us,everybody.
Did you hear that?
Well,yeah,the microphones went haywire.
No,no,not that.
Something else.
Just set that approval issue to
the side for the moment.
Did you ever discuss the project
with anyone outside of ntac?
I mean,someone somewhere must have taken an interest
in what you people were doing over there.
It's a simple question,mr. Ryland.
Surely it can't be that difficult to answer.
If I could have your attention up here,
mr. Ryland...
Security!
Stop that man!
Get some protection around ryland.
Stay here. I'll be right back.
We need an ambulance!
Stand back,please!Back! Get back!
Hey!
Stop! T.J.!
Someone get these photographers out of here.
Stay over there.
I don't understand what I did.
Would somebody please tell to me
what I just did?
Hang on,dennis. The ambulance is coming.
Yeah,it was her.
The blood we picked up at the scene
matches the dna in our records.
That was T.J. Kim running from the courthouse.
When she hit this place,T.J. Drove
every man in the building into a homicidal rage.
Now it sounds like she just zapped one guy.
She's learning to control what she can do.
They all are.
Ever since we took them off the inhibitor,
they're either developing abilities or
they're refining the ones that they've got.
So they are getting more dangerous.
I guess ryland was right.
I'll be sure to mention that to my daughter.
Save the point-
counterpoint.
At the moment,we've been tasked with two jobs--
we track down T.J. Kim.
What's the second job?
We are to protect ryland's
co-conspirators from any further reprisals.
So we arrest them,and now we're their bodyguards?
The entire country just saw a 4400 turn a government
hearing into her own personal slasher film.
If T.J.Gets to ryland again--
or any of them--before we can bring her in,
people are going to start to wonder if the united states
government is capable of protecting its citizens,
and that's the beginning of chaos.
Back to work,please.
Tom...
in case you're wondering,dennis
is still in surgery.
They say that it is touch and go.
It's okay.Give me your hands.
Try and relax.
Relax.
Is it better?
Much better.
For now.
When this thing first came on,it was bad,
but at least she was healthy.
Now she's had diabetes,emphysema...
it seems like every day there's something new.
I'll come help her every day.
Listen,we've got everyone working on this.
We're going to figure it out.
- Is my mother okay?
- Uh,yeah.
She had a little problem.
Shawn fixed it.
It's all in the wrists.
Can I see her?
Please?
Mom?
Isabelle.
Come here.
Is there anything I can do?
No,I'm-- I'm fine.
Really.
Sit down.
You were such a beautiful baby.
I used to hold you all day long.
I knew exactly what you were feeling.
What you wanted.
- We were so close.
- I'm sorry for growing up so fast.
I didn't mean to.
I didn't want to.
Neither did I.
The crazy thing is i keep thinking about patty.
Ryland's wife.
I feel like I should call her or something,
help her through this.
Maybe you should.
You and ryland were friends for a long time.
It's okay to be conflicted.
Well,ryland's little experiment almost
got you killed.
Shawn,too.
The guy knew that kyle was stalking
jordan collier and he did nothing.
I'd say that trumps friendship.
You have so much on your mind.
Kyle,ryland,the 4400s...
I need to get you away from here.
Away from your problems.
Yeah,well,that sounds nice,
but I can't go anywhere.
I'm starting an investigation in the morning.
What if I told you i could take
you away between now and then?
My ability.
Since I'm off the inhibitor...
I think I can control it now.
What,you mean you want to...
you want to take me into another dream world?
Alternate reality--I don't even know what to call it.
Call it a vacation.
A week,a year...
as long as we want.
All that in the space of a few moments.
Should we try it?
Right here?
Now?
Well,what...
what do we do?
We're already doing it.
- There's no one on the beach.
- It's all ours,thomas.
So's the hotel.
And we can stay here for as long as we like.
- There is no jet lag.
- That sounds perfect.
It feels perfect,too.
OCTOBER 14
The door's open. Come in.
What? What is it?
- Uh,you're naked.
- I'm more comfortable this way.
I haven't really gotten used to them.
Clothes.
I have a bathrobe.
Is this better?
Almost.
I never met anybody that read the
encyclopedia from cover to cover before.
- Oh,I'm not finished.
- We just delivered those to you yesterday.
Okay,you're a fast reader.
That's really cool.
Um,listen,they're looking for you down
in the labs.You're like an hour late.
They sent you to get me?
Aren't you in charge?
Well,yeah,more or less.
You know,I go where I'm needed.
They were scared of me,weren't they?
- Pretty much.
- That's all right.
I think even my parents are frightened of me.
I don't think your mom and dad are scared
of you.I think they're just confused.
I don't blame them.
It's mostly how I feel,too.
I...
don't understand what happened to me.
I don't understand what happened to my mother.
And I'm trying to read and learn things,but...
mostly,I just...
I still feel lost.
See,now you sound like a real 4400.
But I'm not a 4400...
not like my mother and father...
or you.
Looks like I'm going to live.
Sorry to disappoint you,tom.
Why'd you ask me to see me,dennis?
I hear that you and skouris are
in charge of the investigation.
Yeah,we know who did it.
We'll find her.
T.J. Kim attacked thuildx weeks.
No one's tracked her down yet.
We got a little sidetracked cleaning
up your mess,dennis.
Did you ever think that maybe she has help?
Other 4400s who feel the same way
about the government she does?
When we catch her,we'll ask.
Will you?
I want to make sure you're going to take
this thing as far as it goes,tom,
the same way you did when you came after me...
and I want my people protected.
They were acting under my orders.
They're under guard.
So was the courthouse when kim attacked.
I'd feel better if you brought them in.
We offered sanctuary to every single conspirator.
There were no takers.
I guess no one wanted to cooperate
with the organization
that was working to put you in prison.
We had to fight just to get them to let
us post agents outside their houses.
Crockett!
You ready to go for a walk,boy?
Come on,crockett.
Let's go.
They wanted no part of us.They all seemed
confident that T.J. Kim was acting alone.Crockett?
What's wrong?
This arrived 15 minutes ago.
This is a message from the nova group.
We are the defensive wing of the 4400.
Today,the world has seen what happens
to those who try to harm us.
A second demonstration of our
capabilities is planned for october 19th.
- A new era dawns.
- Defensive wing,huh?
What happens when they decide to play offense?
- I guess we find out in five days.
- They didn't even say what they want.
No demands,no room for compromise.
We don't even know how many 4400s
are in this nova group.
We couldn't even handle one when she
walked in and attacked the place.
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there,all with abilities?
They've got someone who can kill
you by lowering your body temperature.
- Don't forget the beastmaster.
- What?
That dog got pissed off pretty quick.
Well,I've been all over the files,and none of
these abilities have been registered with us.
They're off the inhibitor now.We can't even pretend
to have a comprehensive list of what these people can do.
Is anyone feeling...
a little overmatched here?
You two remember gary navarro?
Hey,gary.
Been a while.
You're right,baldwin.
I do think you two sold me out.
It really bothered me for a while,but now I
understand it's just standard operating procedure.
Well,I guess that mind reading
thing is working pretty well,huh?
Better than ever,actually.
Gary's telepathic abilities have been
very useful to the national security agency.
They have agreed to let us borrow him
while we investigate the nova group.
So you're clear on what we're doing here?
You want to use a 4400 to track down other 4400s.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Not at all.
It won't be my first time.
So...
can we get started?
Never heard of the nova group.xxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxx Between ntac and this place,
but I trust you realize how serious this is.
Believe me,if I knew anything,I would tell you.
Well,do you mind if the three of us walk
around the place,talk to some people?
You and your pet mind-reader?
No,I can't let you do that.
These people haven't done anything wrong,
and I won't let you invade their privacy,
and I actually can't believe that
you brought this guy here again.
How much do they pay you to spy on
your own kind?Getting a clear signal?
You see anything you like up there?
As far as I can tell,he's not hiding anything.
I have a lot of work to do.
If I hear anything,I'll give you a call.
For now,that's the best I can do.
Sorry about my nephew.
Why?
Well,he was kind of rude back there.
I get that kind of stuff a lot.
I don't take it personally.
Do you mind if I ask you...
you've sort of implied that you've
pursued 4400s in the past.
What exactly do you do for the nsa?
Overseas stuff,mostly.
But,like,what?
Give me an example.
They fly me someplace.
I approach the subject,
find out what he's thinking,
and I tell the people i work for,who then
fly me home,where I live comfortably.
What happens to the subject?
I don't ask.
That's good.
The neural pathway comparisons
are particularly illuminating.
Make sure you understand them
before you move on.
Dr. Burkhoff,I don't understand any of this.
A bunch of her neurons don't work anymore.
Every time one of hers turns off,
one of mine turns on.
Exactly...
and what's true for neurons is
true for muscle fibers,synaptic pathways...
there is A...
one-to-one correspondence between the
amount you lost and the amount you gained.
So all this is just a way of saying
I'm doing this to her?
The correlation is too precise to be random.
Your rapid aging has caused her rapid aging.
How do we stop it?
Put me back to the way I was.
- I'm afraid I can'T.
- So,what do we do about it?
There is a possibility that if the aging agent
were eliminated that lily might be
restored to her normal self.
- The aging agent?
- He means me.
I'm killing you.The only way for you
to live is for me to die,isn't that right?
Don't answer that,dr. Burkhoff.
Thank you for your time.We're done here.
Where are you going?
We're not discussing this.
Not now.Not ever.
- It's true,isn't it?
- I think so.
But it's only a theory.
Guys,I went over this six weeks
ago with the men in black.
Humor us.
I went on two dates with T.J. Kim.
I cut it off.
- Girl had a lot of baggage.
- How long ago was that?
Uh,two months ago?
Look,if I'd known there'd be government agents
showing up every other day to ask me about her,
I would've taken notes,
hey,so listen...
all this stuff about october 19th...
you guys think it's serious?
Like,should I be getting out of town?
I don't think that's the answer.As far as
we know,you're as safe here as anywhere else.
That kid was lying...
or at least he wasn't telling you everything.
The whole time you were talking to him,
he was thinking about an address.
331 reynolds avenue.
Looks like it's clear.
Nobody's home.
Nobody's been for home for a while,
I'd say.
Look at this.
That's the government report on
the return of the 4400.
I tried to read this once.
Kind of dry.
Yeah.Looks like someone made it
right through to the end.
Liies!!!
Wesley hauser.
Wesley hauser.
Wesley hauser.
Who the hell is wesley hauser?
Hauser was a marine.
Did two tours of duty in vietnam.
He led protests against the war after he
got home in '72.Disappeared in '75.
Once he got out of quarantine,
he never checked back in with us.
Guy's been living off the grid
for almost two years.
Which means he never went on the inhibitor,
so who knows what he's capable of by now.
Hauser was disillusioned with
the government before he disappeared,
and I wouldn't say we've done much to
win him over since he's been back.
When he was in quarantine,he was housed
in barracks 3.Same building as T.J. Kim.
An agitator.An organizer.
A radical.
Sounds like we have our second
member of the nova group.
Baldwin.
You're kidding me.
All right. I know.Put him through.
- Says he's wesley hauser.
- No way.
- Yeah,hello.
- How'd you like my apartment?
Well,to be honest,it felt a little
empty without you there.
I'm on a tight schedule.
Lot to do before next week.
Sound like you have interesting plans,
so why don't we get together someplace,talk them over?
No more talking.
There's nothing to say.
Your time is ending.
Ours begins on october 19th.
come on,let me go.
Why'd you run when we asked
you about hauser,huh?
You two used to eat together in quarantine.
We've got it on camera.
So?The guy had a lot of good war stories.
Doesn't make us best friends.
So why did you run?
Because when I see ntac agents,
I run the other way.
You people almost killed us all.
Can you blame me?
Turn around.
Turn around.
- We done here?
- Get out of here.
Call me sensitive,
but I felt like saying to him,
"we exposed the inhibitor.We saved your life."
You guys just don't really get it,do you?
It's not just that guy.
Every 4400
we've talked to today,they're scared of you,
or they don't trust you,or they hate you.
Look,I'm sorry,but the days when you could expect
friendly conversation from these people,they're gone.
You're the bad guys now.
Get used to it.
I'm just warning you,
motherhood's no cakewalk.
Since when are you an expert?
I'm only saying she landed on twins.
Kind of a big responsibility...
especially when she's trying to get
by on a teacher's salary.
- What are you going to name them?
- I don't really want to play anymore.
- Is that okay?
- What's wrong,sweetheart?
Nothing,except...
I know marco's going to win,I'm going to come second,
and you're going to end up alone with no money.
Don't be jealous.
He's smarter than you,but mom likes you better.
So,uh,who's--
who's smarter than me?
Who knows?
I'm not even sure she knows exactly.
You know,in some ways,
she was better off on the promicin inhibitor.
At least she wasn't overwhelmed
back then.
All she wants to do is record what
she sees in those notebooks.
It's like some kind of compulsion.
Well...
think about it for a minute.
Every morning,she wakes up and...
knows pretty much what's coming.
She's already lived the whole
day once in her head,
and by the time something actually
does happen,it's like a rerun.
- I hate watching reruns.
- Yeah. Try living one.
Hey,what about kevin burkhoff?
Maybe he can figure out a way for
maia to control her visions.
He is brilliant.
I don't say this about many people,
but he is smarter than me.
- I know you.
- Well,of course you do.It's diana skouris.
- You work at ntac.
- I'm not here on business.
I'm here about my daughter maia.
The precog.
What about her?
She's still 10,right?
She's not 65 now,is she?
Interesting guess.
Kind of wide of the mark,though.
Good.
Might as well come on in.
Thank you.
- Oh,sorry about the clutter.
- That's all right.
I fired the maid last week.
She was always cleaning.
Excuse me.
So...
your daughter.
What's troubling her?
OCTOBER 15
I'll let you do it.
I caused all this,right?
And getting rid of me is the only way
to save my mother.
- No...
- that's what you were thinking,wasn't it?
No,it wasn'T.
I don't want her to die either,
so I'll let you do it.I'll...
- I'll even shut my eyes.
- Isabelle...
I would never hurt you.
Why?
I don't understand.
It's the only way to save her.
We don't know that,and I won't
make a choice between the two of you.
"Won't" or "can't"?
Sorry.
I don't mean to invade anyone's space.
Oh,that's okay.
It's not my desk.
But it looks like you'll be here for
a while now,huh?
Assuming this place is still standing
on october 20th,yeah.
Maybe we should talk to jarvis.
Get you a room of your very own.
That's fine with me.
To tell you the truth,I could use a
little bit of a buffer zone.
This problem you're having with your daughter'S...
precog ability?
I keep wanting to give you my opinion,
but I don't want to intrude.
So you are...
listening to my thoughts.
You and baldwin.
I can't help it.
I try to tune you guys out,but every now
and then,something leaks through.
I'll try to keep that in mind.
You said you had an opinion about maia.
What is it?
When I first...
developed this thing of mine,
I was a basket case.You saw me.
I truly thought i was going insane,
so I fought against it,
and that just made it worse.
I had to give in to it,
let it take control of me,
and then,slowly,I learned how to
take control of it.
Listen,your kid stops fighting,
and eventually,
it'll become like seeing or hearing
or any other sense.
She won't even think about it.
It's just a part of who she is.
That's how it worked for me,anyway.
Thank you.
Diana.We just got a call from the seattle
police.Someone down there read our apb.
They know exactly where hauser is.
You guys are lucky,actually.
In another day or two,we would have
buried him in potter's field.
- Buried who?
- Him.
I always read the apb memos when they
circulate in the police department.
Kind of a hobby.
Gets boring in here.
Anyway,there was a description of a
regimental tattoo on the memo for hauser.
82nd airborne.
"Death from above."
I remember it from a john doe they
brought in here three weeks ago.
This guy drowned in the harbor.
A lot of veterans have that tattoo.
Do a lot of veterans look exactly
like the mug shot you circulated?
Don't believe me?
Take a look for yourselves.
Say hello to wesley hauser.
Hauser died two and a half weeks
before ryland was attacked.
Obviously,that wasn't him on the
phone the other day.
And that copy of the 4400 report
with all his notes over it?
For all we know,that could have been a plant.
Somebody wanted us distracted.
They deliberately put us on the trail
of some phantom member of the nova group.
I mean,how did we first find out about hauser?
T.J.'S old boyfriend.
He gave us the address.
No,he was thinking it.
At least,according to gary,he was.
Gary navarro put us onto wesley hauser.
Get in.
You lied to me,daniel.
You never said anything about killing people.
We were protecting you,shawn.
If we tell you in advance,you're culpable.
- What is she dohere?
- She's dying.She needs your help.
I told you,I don't want anything more
to do with you.
The nova group was supposed to protect us.
That's why I gave you money,daniel.
That's why I gave you money.
Not to start a terrorist organization!
We'll talk about your concerns later.
She's got a stomach wound,and it's infected.
She needs you right now,
or she's not going to make it.
Shawn,she's a 4400.
If we don't help each other,
what hope do we have?
Give me your hand.
What are you doing here?
You're awake.
Good.
It's important that you know it was me.
I'm the guy who killed you.
Med post.
Do you have a 20 on gary navarro?
Yeah,he just walked by.
Why?
- Get him!
- Hey! Stop!
Go. I'll check on ryland.
He's seizing.
He's bradying down.
I need a crash cart and ativan.
Find dr. Danoff.
Now!
Stay right there,gary.
Isabelle.
Isabelle!
Oh,god.
Somebody call an ambulance!
What's everybody standing around for?
Somebody call an ambulance!
They're on their way!
- Somebody call an ambulance--
- dad...
what am I?
It's miraculous,shawn.
I watch you heal someone,and...
it makes me wonder why they
hate us so much.
They hate us because you're killing them,
daniel.
They're afraid of us.
I can't blame them.
You make it sound like we acted out of
some sort of blood lust.
These were precise,tactical strikes,shawn,
and you and every other 4400 are
ultimately much safer because of them.
You killed people.That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.
I gave you money to start a defensive
arm for the center in case
the government ever came after us again.
It was a precaution.
And all we've done is taken
precautionary measures.
Shawn,do you think that because
their inhibitor program
was exposed that the government's
just going to leave us in peace?
No,they know we've gotten stronger,
which threatens their hold on power,
which increases their need to eliminate us.
So we strike first?
Is that it?
Is that what happens on the 19th?
Look,shawn,you do great work at
that center of yours.
You just focus on that.I don't want to
distract you.Knowledge can be a burden.
And thanks for helping T.J. Out.
You're a hero to your own people.
Never forget that.
Yeah.
It did not work,you know.
Ryland was O.D.'Ing,
but the doctors pulled him out of it.
He'll be awake within a couple of hours.
Well,I'm sure you're as
disappointed as I am.
Don't worry.
We'll get him.
Let's talk about wesley hauser.
You first met him in quarantine.
I liked wes.
He was 10 kinds of crazy,but his heart
was in the right place.
I guess he was bipolar or something,
but he never took medication.
After quarantine,he lived on the streets.
I used to visit him down at the docks.
You know,give him food,a little money.
So when did you decide to kill him?
Wes,he didn't need my help with that.
He drank about three bottles of mad dog a day.
One morning about a month ago,
I went down to see him,and...
I found him by the dumpster.
Dead.
And somewhere in the middle of your grieving
process,you figured he'd make a handy decoy.
Hauser wouldn't have minded.
XXXXXXXX Going back to his marine corps days.
So when I found him,I said a word
or two over his body,
and I pushed him into elliott bay.
So how long have you been working
with this nova group?
Did someone approach you,or was the
whole thing your idea?
Tell me...
you and this girlfriend of yours...
is it like a role-playing thing you get up to?
Or is she actually taking you into these...
I don't know.What do you call it?
Fantasy worlds?
Oh,and this guy marco...
does he know that you're too...
embarrassed to tell your partner
that you two have been dating?
Done showing off?
Why don't you tell us what's
going to happen on october 19th?
I guess you're going to have
to find yourself another telepath.
Good luck with that.
So you got nothing out of him?
Well,he told us about hauser,but as far as the
nova goes,it's going to take time to break him down.
- How much time?
- He's a telepath.He knows what we're thinking.
- A little longer than usual.
- Okay,so it's not easy,
but gary navarro has a level-seven
security clearance.
We have to assume that he's been using it to
funnel national secrets to the nova group.
We need to know what he knows.
Now.
He'll talk.
Gary's been inside our heads for a year.
I think I know how to get inside of his.
Careful with this.
Matthew.
I didn't expect to see you back
for a couple of weeks.
The nova group revised my calendar for me.
Wiped it clean,actually.
It's difficult to lobby on behalf of the 4400
when some of them are boasting about
their body count.
I suppose.
How's lily?
Any improvement since I left?
- If anything,she's getting worse.
- Sorry to hear that.
Isabelle?
She tried to kill herself this morning.
She jumped off the roof.
A few minutes later,she was walking
around like nothing happened.
I got to tell you,matthew...
I'm not going to lie.
I'm really glad you're back.
Hello,isabelle.
Hello. Who are you?
My name is matthew ross.
I work closely with shawn.
I'm an advisor to the 4400.
May I come in?
I understand there was an incident
this morning.
You attempted...
to harm yourself.
I see.
You had no right to do that!
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?
- No...
- well,I do.
I know everything about you,isabelle.
I know why you're here,and I know what
you're supposed to do.
Sit...
and I'll tell you a story.
You'll like it.
It's about your past,and it's about your future.
I know you went to a lot of
trouble to get this.
Thank you.
But?
I'm not sure i want to send maia
to a school that only teaches 4400s.
It sounds like a great way to get
her to withdraw even further from the world.
Look,just...
just pretend it's got nothing to
do with the 4400 for a second.
It's a good school.
You know,top-notch faculty,
the facilities are great,and it's all free.
The 4400 center picks up the whole tab.
They even have a class on how
to manage your abilities.
Just give me some time to think about it,okay?
It's a big step.
I was king of hoping dr.
Burkhoff would have...
I don't know,a magic pill or something.
What's he working on?
Anything interesting?
You know that promicin serum that
he invented that saved everybody?
Well,I saw a syringe at his place,
and it looked like there was some in it.
Well,he's a researcher,right?
He's probably injecting it into,
what,mice,guinea pigs?
The only animals i saw at his place
were a couple of cockroaches.
You don't think he's injecting it
into himself,do you?
That's ridiculous.I am not injecting
myself with the promicin serum.
Good.
I'm glad to hear it.
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.
Dr. Burkhoff,I have to ask you this.
Have you stopped taking your medication?
Of course not.
I'm as sane as you are.
Once the course of treatment is finished,
I will have taught my body how
to produce promicin,
and then I will be the first
non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities.
The first of many.
You're talking about the next
step in human evolution.
- Do you think the world is ready for that?
- The world is never ready for change.
You have to force it on them.
Isn't that why the 4400 were brought back?
Isn't that why the future woke me up?
You shouldn't be doing research
of this magnitude in--excuse me,but...
in a dump.
These are hardly sterile working conditions.
You could help me with that.
You have scientific background,right?
I have graduate degrees in microbiology
and epidemiology.
Good.
That'll be handy.
I need someone to monitor my progress...
as the changes...
continue.
Changes?
I think it's an exciting first step.
Don't you?
I was thinking,next time,we could make a
world where kyle never shot jordan collier,
never went to prison,the inhibitor
scandal never happened...
sounds nice...
although i have to tell you,at the moment,
I'm not really feeling the need to be
transported to some kind of fantasy world.
As long as this water stays hot,things
are a-okay with me right here in reality.
Maybe tomorrow we can try it again.
I'll take a rain check.
I'm going to a seminar at
the 4400 center tomorrow.
It's about what we can expect
physically now that we're off the inhibitor.
Is everything okay?
I mean,you're not having any problems,are you?
No,I feel fine.
I feel great,actually.
Well,then I don't get it.
Why do you need to go?
I don'T.I want to go.
I'm curious.
But alana,you never...
you never wanted to go to the center before.
Why start now?
I never felt the need to be around
other 4400s before.
Now you do?
It's just a seminar,thomas.
Yeah,okay.
I get it.
OCTOBER 16
Do you recognize those names?
They're 4400s,all of them foreign nationals.
Alessandro ortiz from venezuela.
Ismael namir from libya.
Chitra singh from indonesia.
They've all gone missing in the past year.
That's one year.
Now,that's about as long you've
worked for the nsa,isn't it,gary?
We checked your travel records.
You left venezuela two days before ortiz disappeared.
Same thing in libya,indonesia...
everyone on that list.
You were there,they went away.
What exactly did you do for the nsa,gary?
There's an arms race going on,isn't there?
Only now it's with 4400s.
These people,I bet their abilities
make the wrong people very nervous.
And the nsa couldn't stand by while foreign--
and potentially hostile--
governments developed,what,
human weapons of mass destruction?
Is this list complete?
'Cause I'm just wondering
how many 4400s you did kill.
I did not kill anyone.
Oh,no,no,no,you just got the right
people in the right zip code.
Because you,you were living back home--
what did he say?
Oh,yeah--
"very comfortably" when the actual
dirty work was done.
And that's why you went across to
the nova group,isn't it,gary?
Because you just couldn't live with yourself.
The nsa told me that I was helping my country.
They didn't fill in the blanks.
I had to do that myself.
You felt used.
They made you a weapon against your own people.
So when did you figure it out?
- What's up?
- Who are these guys?
This is agent wood and dr. Boll of the nsa.
They've been brought in to help
expedite the interrogation.
Okay,first of all,no more sitting.
What's going on?
Brought in by who?
Gary navarro tried to kill me.
I made a phone call.
You should be in jail right now,dennis.
I still have a few friends,tom.
I had him talking.
I was making progress.
Not fast enough.
The members of gary's cell
know he's been taken.
They're already changing their plans.
If it takes too long to break him,
the information he gives us is stale.
October 19th is three days away.
Yeah.
I know you find this hard to believe,
tom,but we're on the same side.
We have the same goal.
Those agents are tools.
Use them.
You're sitting in my spot.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
There's room for two people to sit.
You got stalin,pol pot,and the marquis de sade?
Did you finish all the fun books?
Well,I'm interested in learning
more about evil.
Everybody's scared of me,so I thought,
"what if they're right?What if I'm bad?"
Why would you think that?
Sometimes I think i feel it inside of me,
like....
I could be capable of anything.
Everyone's capable of anything.
- Believe me,I know.
- How?
- Have you done bad things?
- Yeah,of course I have.
Will you tell me about them?
Um,okay.
- I slept with my brother's girlfriend.
- How bad is that?
Some people would call that a major betrayal.
A lot of hard feelings.
This man did much worse than that.
Well,I'm not a dictator,but
I've done the big kind of bad,too.
I can't say much about it,
but I gave some money to some people.
They used it for something really,
really wrong,and...
- I don't think that they're finished.
- Well,can you stop them?
I could turn them in,but the thing is
so far,they've only gone after bad people,
people that tried to kill me,
tried to kill all of us.
So if they've only gone after bad people,
then doesn't that make them good?
Maybe.
I don't know.
We're relating now,aren't we?
I read about this.
Yeah,we are.
How was it for you?
I liked it.
We talked.
It helped me understand good and evil.
According to you,you get to pick.
It's a choice.
I have it right,don't I?
Yeah,you do.
OCTOBER 17
I can't open my hand.
I woke up from a nap,
and it was all bunched up like this.
Arthritis I can handle.
That feels good.
You're like a human heating pad.
I like that.
Human heating pad.
I'll take it as a compliment.
Seriously,you better?
Yeah.
I've been trading emails with
somebody down at the mayo clinic.
He says we should go to sweden
and try this experimental treatment.
Here.
What's this?
Open it.
Can you believe that the air
force lets you do that now?
You give them some money,
and they let you ride along in an f-16.
It says here i get to take the controls.
Oh,I talked to the guy who was
in charge of the program,
and I told him about your
background as a pilot,
and he said he would let you
drive for 30 seconds.
Lily,I was a pilot in 1950.
That's why it's only 30 seconds.
Happy birthday,richard.
Thanks,but it's not my birthday
for another six weeks.
Richard,I'm not going to be
here in six weeks.
That's not true.
Yes,it is.
You and I have both known for a while.
Richard,I'm dying.
Lily...
I know how hard this is on you,
but you can't give up.
Shawn said he's willing to stay
here with you all day if he has to.
He'll keep you healthy.
He can'T.
Not anymore.
Are all these people 4400s?
Well,some are,and some just wish they were.
Why would they want that?
Good morning.
Welcome to the center.
Are you a 4400?
No,sweetie.
Are you?
Well,it is an honor to meet you.
Are you here to take our seminar?
No,we're here to look at the school.
We have an appointment with ms. Tobey.
I'll get her right away.
In the meantime,would you sign
in and register your ability?
We're creating a database.
You sure you want to do this?
I want to meet kids like me.
My name is alana mareva.
I have to admit,
I was pretty hesitant about
coming here today.
I was lucky.My life was pretty
much intact when I was returned.
I never thought much about being a 4400,
but when we all got sick,
and seeing everyone together in quarantine...
it made me feel like I had been
denying a part of myself,
so...
here I am,and I'm glad I came.
Anything you want to tell me?
Gary...
Let's end this.
I'll let you sit down.
Who contacted you first?
Just give me a name.
Oh,man.
So how about it?
October 19th is two days away.
Now,you got something to tell me or not?
Suit yourself.
One of our members has been compromised.
I have to assume he's going to give up my name.
So you call me?
For all I know,ntac is monitoring this line.
Well,we're going to have to go underground.
It's going to cost money.
You think I'm just going to
write you a check?
You can arrange it however you want.
I need it tomorrow.
I will see you at the usual
spot at the usual time.
We are in a war,
and we all have to do our part.
Talk to me,gary.
What do you got to say,man?
Talk to me!
Talk to me,gary.
I need names.
Give me a name!
- Talk to me,gary.
- Daniel armand!
Daniel armand.
Daniel armand.
Okay.
It's a start.
- Who else?
- That's it. He was my only contact.
I never met anyone else in the group.
He kept us all separate.
I'm sorry.I'm just having a hard
time believing that's true.
His pulse is tachy at 210.
Systolic's up to 240.
We need to lay off.
- We've only got one name.
- You can't put him under again.Not for a few hours.
We haven't got a few hours.
Don't worry.
He's my responsibility.
No,he's not. He's ours.
And he's done for the day.
It's okay,gary.
Okay,so he's back.
It's not like we weren't expecting this.
No.
Relax.
He won't get anywhere near isabelle.
We'll find him and we'll deal with it.
You made a mistake.
You've got the wrong person.
- I have to go.
- I don't think I do.
Those things you told me?
Those things you said i'm going to do?
That's not me.
I have a choice.
And I don't know who you are,
and I don't know how you think
you know so much about me,but you're wrong.
Isabelle...
I understand why you're having
trouble adjusting.
Growing up is hard.
But don't be angry at the messenger.
It's not my plan.
I'm just here to help facilitate.
To help you reach your full potential.
Think of me as a favorite uncle.
No.
No,I don't have any uncles.
I don't have any uncles,
and I won't be a part of any plan.
Fair enough.
You can always opt out.
You can even try saving your mother,
if you like.
How?
What is that?
Open it.
There aren't
a lot of things that'll hurt you,isabelle...
but that right there,that'll do the job.
If you can't accept the fact that your life
is vastly more important than your mother's,
just give yourself that shot.
You'll be dead in minutes.
And lily?
Who knows.
Maybe she'll wake up and be
a young woman again.
Will it really save her?
I don't know.
It's a gamble.
But if you can't live with who you are,
then don'T.
Sorry about that.
Ah. Good.
I knew it.
I knew I had a clean cup somewhere.
Now,where are the filters?
It's okay.
I don't need coffee.
I swear I just saw them.
Do you mind if I just use paper towels?
- Kevin,if I do this--
- "if" you do it?
You're already doing it.
You're here,right?
If I monitor you throughout this experiment,
I need you to know one thing--
if it gets to a point where your
life is in danger,I am cutting this off.
I will not stand by and watch you die.
Well,I would hope not...
because I'm too valuable.
I think it's going to be fun.
I haven't really...
worked with anyone for quite some time.
I'm looking forward to it.
Me too.
So...
want to draw some blood?
OCTOBER 18
Nina.
We were just downstairs.
The guard on duty said wood signed gary out.
Gary was transferred to an nsa-run facility.
But he's a 4400.
He's our jurisdiction.
And someone at the pentagon
signed an order overriding us.
Apparently,they feel we lack experience
in high-pressure interrogation.
And who do you think put that
little bug in their ear?
I don't know if it was ryland or not,
but we had our shot at navarro.
Tomorrow is october 19th.We are a day
away from an announced terrorist attack.
The nsa thinks they can get him to talk.
So where are they taking him?
- They didn't share that information.
- This is so wrong.
This is the only place in the country that's
at least somewhat equipped to handle 4400s.
Do you think that I didn't tell them that?
They weren't interested.
- Isabelle.
- Hi.
May I come in?
Are you going somewhere?
I saw dad putting luggage into his car.
Oh,we're just going to try another clinic,
but we will be away for a while.
Do you want me to come with you?
No,it's all right.
Thank you.
Now,if there's anything that you need,
you talk to shawn.
He'll be looking out for you.
Okay?
And...
I want to give you this.
It's my wedding band.
I inherited it from my grandmother.
Her name was lily,too.
You used to love to play with it
when you were a little baby.
I remember.
I used to like to bite on it.
And my finger,too.
You can wear it if you want.I always knew
that I would give it to you one day.
It doesn't fit me anymore,and...
I'd hate to lose it.
I'll keep it safe for you.
I know you will.
I'm sorry i have to leave so soon.
I...
I wish we had more time together.
- Well,when do you think you'll be back?
- It's hard to say.
Goodbye,isabelle.
Bye.
Thank you very much.
I'll take her from here.
Thank you.
Okay...
you told her we were going over
to the hospital?
How'd it go over?
Fine.I had it easy.
I got to lie.
You're the one who has to tell her the truth.
What's going on?
What's happening?
We'll get him.
Funny,that's the exact same thing
navarro said about you.
So far,he's wrong.
He never should have been moved
in the first place.
- There was no reason--
- there was every reason.
You're too soft,tom.
I don't know what's happened to you.
I had him,dennis!
You lost him!
Sunset's in four hours.
At this point,we can't even say with 100% certainty
that it's going to rise again in the morning,
and the one guy who can tell us is gone.
That's a defeatist attitude.
We'll get him.
Yeah. I know.
You keep saying that.
Hey,shawn.
You got something for me?
Where's daniel?
Busy. He sent me.
No,no,no.
That's not how we work.
Today it is.
You can trust me.
You saved my life.
I owe you.
Come on.Let's get this over with.
I feel a little naked standing out here.
Thanks.
Listen,if there's ever anything you need--
you sold us out.
- You okay?
- Yeah,I'm fine.
I don't guess we'll be seeing
her in court any time soon.
You did the right thing by calling us,shawn.
Seriously.You're a hero.
OCTOBER 19
One minute to go.
Just tell me one thing--
are we as prepared as we can be?
The entire country is on level-red
terror alert.
All commercial air traffic has
been suspended for the day.
The national guard has been
deployed to likely targets.
"Likely targets."
Kind of a broad term.
I wish T.J. Could have narrowed
that down for us.
Well,me,too,but we have to keep
her sedated to inhibit her ability.
She's already turned this place
into a war zone once.
So now we wait.
Anyone else feel like they're
staring at a doomsday clock?
Well,that's it.
October 19th.
Looks like the world's still here.
For the moment,anyway.
Oh,my god!
What? What happened?
It's the nova group.
Certainly,"miracle" is an imprecise term,
but I'm not sure how else to describe it.
To repeat,I'm broadcasting livefrom
the nubian desert north of khartoum,
where,overnight,a thousand-acre
patchof barren sand
has somehow been transformedinto
fertile wheat fields.
Scientists are at a loss to explain
the conversion,
but tests confirm that the wheat
is real and edible.
There hasn't been food growing in that part
of the world since before the birth of christ.
They make us all terrified,
and then,rather than attacking us,
they give us a gift.
Our station has just received
a statement from the radical
4400 organization known as the nova group,
claiming responsibility for this morning'S
transformation.
You are witnesses to the beginning
of a new era.
What happens next is up to you.
The 4400 can be mankind's greatest ally
or its most dangerous adversary.
Don't kid yourself.It's an attack.
An act of aggression,anyway.
They just showed everyonethat they
can change the world,
and there's nota damn thing
we can do about it.
Hello?
I'm very disappointed in you,shawn.
Daniel.
I realize you're still a young man,
but I'm afraid i can't forgive you.
To repeat,
I'm broadcasting live
from the nubian desert
north of khartoum where,overnight...
it's okay,kyle.
Daddy'S...
daddy's here.
I'm right here.
I'm right here.
Just go to sleep.
Hey. I'm tyler.
Maia.
lily...
we are here.
Hasn't changed much,
has it?
No.
We were so happy here.
Just you and me and the baby.
It was so much simpler.
Would you like to head on inside?
Not just yet.
No,let'S...let's stay out here for a while.
It's so peaceful.
Remember
when you went into labor?
I could hardly get the car in gear.
But you gave me directions to the hospital.
How did you stay so calm?
Lily?

Season 03 Episode 01-02</font>
Durant les 60 dernières années
4000 personnes ont été enlevées..
Toutes sont revenues en même temps.
sans un souvenir d'où elles étaient.
Elles n'avaient pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines étaient revenues avec de nouvelles capacités.
Tous essaient de renouer....
...avec une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le Salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans "les 4400"...
Quoi, alors Navarro était réellement une
sorte de "liseur de pensées" ?
Je crois que "télépathe" est le
mot que vous cherchez.
Concentrez vous juste sur ce que vous voulez
me demander et je vous entendrai.
Le gars savait bel et bien ce que nous pensions.
J'entrevois déjà quelques
utilités pour ça.
Tu aurais dû venir d'abord vers moi.
Je t'aurais traité mieux qu'ils ne
l'auraient jamais fait.
Nous sommes en guerre.
Ne choisis pas le camp des perdants.
Il y a une substance synthétique présente
dans le sang de tous les 4400.
Et ils appellent ça "inhibiteur de promicine".
Mais le NTAC a toujours étudié
les 4400 depuis leur retour.
- Ils auraient dû être au courant.
- Ils SONT au courant.
On m'a ordonné de travailler sur un médicament
supprimant la synthèse de promicine.
Une fois que j'ai synthétisé l'inhibiteur
nous l'avons donné à tous les 4400.
S'il faut décider entre la sécurité,
des Américains et le bien-être des 4400.
Tom...
Le choix est déjà fait.
Si tu t'obstines à vouloir couvrir cette opération,
Il va falloir que tu me descendes ici et maintenant.
Chaque homme de ce batiment
a plus de 4 litres d'adrénaline,
Coulant dans ses veines,
et la plupart sont armés.
Récemment un 4400 a mis à mal un
bâtiment gouvernemental,
et est reparti sans verser une goutte de sueur.
Je n'étais pas enceinte quand j'ai été enlevée,
mais je l'étais à mon retour.
Vous avez vu ce dont elle est capable,
ce qu'elle peut faire quand elle se sent menacée.
Saviez-vous qu'Isabelle a des connexions
entre les parties
droite et gauche de son cerveau qui
n'avaient jamais été vues auparavant?
Vous êtes les garants du futur.
Votre fille est la clé pour comprendre,
Ce qui est arrivé aux 4400.
Isabelle...
Isabelle!
Bonjour, Shawn.
Je suis isabelle
Le monde a changé.
Tout est différent désormais.
Le programme d'inhibition de la promicine
était un projet international.
Son but était d'empêcher un monde,
dominé par une petite fraction de la population.
En résumé, nous avons fait tout notre possible,
pour empêcher les 4400 de développer
des aptitudes surhumaines.
Nous pensions que, sans le
programme d'inhibition,
ces capacités, se seraient manifestées,
dans chacun des 4400.
Je ne pense pas avoir besoin
d'expliquer à cette commission
Pourquoi ce serait loin d'être
le meilleur des scénarios.
Soudain, les humains normaux comme vous et moi,
et toutes les institutions sur lesquelles
nous comptons seraient obsolètes.
Le programme n'était pas parfait.
Des gens sont tombés malades. D'autres sont morts.
Ce n'était pas notre intention.
Mais maintenant c'est fait,
Et le futur que nous avons essayé
d'empêcher est ici.
Et nous ne sommes pas prêts.
Je crois qu'ici tout est
une question de pouvoir.
Qui le détiendra?
Nous...ou eux?
Parce que, croyez moi...
Ca va en revenir...
à nous contre eux.
3 semaines plus tôt.
Shawn, je ne te comprend pas.
Dis moi juste ce qui cloche avec Isabelle.
Je te l'ai dit,
je ne peux l'expliquer.
Est-elle malade?
Est-elle blessée?
Tu le verras par toi-même..
Papa !
Q-qui est donc cette personne?
Où est Isabelle?
Je suis ta fille.
Je suis Isabelle.
- J-je ne comprends pas.
- Ce n'est pas une blague.
Quelque chose s'est produit. Je... j'ai changé.
Je ne sais pas comment.
Elle est venue me voir. Elle connaissait mon nom.
Elle semblait tout savoir de toi et Lily.
Stop!
Je ne sais pas quel jeu vous jouez là,
et je m'en fiche.
Richard... richard..
Lily.
Lily!
Lily?
Isabelle est avec toi?
Lily--
Lily.
Tu vas bien?
Oh, Richard, j'ai dû m'évanouir..
Isabelle est avec toi?
Qui êtes vous?
Où est ma femme?
Richard, de quoi parles-tu?
Je suis Lily, ta femme.
Pourquoi me regardes-tu ainsi...
Oh, mon Dieu.
M'dame, je ne sais pas qui vous êtes.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Non!
Votre tension est élevée...
Mais je suppose que c'était à prévoir.
Coeur, poumons, réflexes...
Tout est dans les normales.
- Docteur, vous appelez ça normal ?
- Richard, je veux voir Isabelle.
- Où est ma fille?
- Elle est dehors.
Je te la ramène dans une minute..
Je réalise à quel point ça peut être alarmant,
mais au moins vous pouvez être soulagés du fait que
Votre femme est une femme agée en
parfaite santé.
Si je devais deviner, je dirais
qu'elle a dans les 75 ans.
J'ai 29 ans...
et je ne comprends pas.
Aidez moi à comprendre.
Comment cela a-t-il pu arriver?
Peut-etre est-ce une réaction à
l'arrêt de l'inhibiteur de promicine?
Sans vous mentir, je ne sais pas.
Il y a une maladie appelée "progeria"..
Elle se traduit par un vieillissement rapide.
Alors ce genre de choses est déjà arrivé?
Mr. Tyler...
Quand votre femme a perdu connaissance
ce matin, elle était une jeune femme.
Quand elle s'est réveillée moins d'une minute
plus tard, elle avait vieilli de 50 ans..
Je ne peux vous le garantir...
C'est une première.
Excusez moi.
- Vous allez bien, Dr. Burkhoff?
- Bien.
Pas assez dormi, voilà tout.
Chercheur...
Bien, que faisons-nous maintenant?
Y a-t-il un moyen d'inverser cela?
J'aurais aimé le connaitre.
J'ai besoin...
d'y réflechir.
Etes-vous ma mère??
Isabelle?
Aujourd'hui.
Chaque jour, les 4400 changent et deviennent
plus forts,
Au lieux de se mobiliser pour faire face à ce challenge
Nous nous creusons la tête pour déterminer
"qui savait", "quoi" et "quand..".
Je vais épargner à cette commission l'ennui
et le coût d'une longue enquête.
Le programme d'inhibition était mon idée.
J'étais fier de le diriger.
Les hommes sur ce tableau ne faisaient
que suivre mes ordres.
S'il y a quelqu'un à condamner,
c'est moi.
Et moi seul.
Oui, je sais que Kyle ne veut pas me voir..
N'y-a-t'il pas un moyen de l'y forcer?
Je suis son père.
Je veux savoir comment il va.
Dites, je comprends que vous essayez,
mais il se passera des mois avant son procès.
Et je n'attendrai pas aussi longtemps.
Je veux dire, vous pensez vraiment que les
gens vont laisser Ryland,
Se placer comme une sorte de martyr patriotique?
Cet homme a mené une conspiration
qui a causé la mort de 28 personnes.
Bien, il dit que c'était accidentel.
Une part significative de cet état
le croit.
Plutôt "accablante".
Vous avez écouté la radio dernièrement?
Les appels sont comme à 90% en sa faveur...
On peut acheter un tshirt
"libérez Ryland" dans un de ces batiments.
Peut-être qu'ils pourraient l'élire
prix Nobel de la paix.
Dites lui juste que j'ai besoin de lui parler.
Nous ne sommes pas obligés de parler du dossier.
Je dois juste voir mon fils.
Demandez lui juste encore une fois, ok ?
Et dites lui que nous l'aimons.
Donne lui du temps, Thomas.
Kyle a besoin de vivre avec son choix
durant un certain temps.
On reprend.
Tom...
La pause est finie.
Mesdames et messieurs, j'aimerais
reprendre la séance.
Que tout le monde prenne place
Nous pouvons poursuivre.
Membres de la presse, l'expression
"mesdames et messieurs" vous incluait. Merci.
Mr. Ryland,
J'aimerais reprendre l'interrogatoire là où nous en étions restés..
Vous insistez sur le fait que vous êtes le seul responsable,
Du lancement du programme de l'inhibiteur de promicine. Est-ce correct ?
Oui, monsieur.
C'était mon programme depuis le début.
Alors cette commission est supposée comprendre
que votre département était en mesure de planifier
et d'exécuter une conspiration internationale
sans l'approbation de sa hiérarchie?
C'est exact. J'avais une grande marge de manoeuvre
en tant que directeur du NTAC.
J'estimais que ce projet était dans cette marge,
Ainsi je n'avais aucun besoin d'approbation extérieure.
Veuillez tous nous excuser.
T'as entendu ça?
Oui, les microphones ont disjoncté.
Non, non, pas ça.
Autre chose.
Mettez ce problème d'approbation
de côté pour le moment.
Avez-vous parlé de ce projet
avec quiconque extérieur au NTAC?
Je veux dire, quelqu'un... quelque part... devait
s'intéresser à ce que vous faisiez là-bas.
C'est une quesion simple, Mr. Ryland.
Il ne doit pas être difficle d'y répondre.
Si je pouvais avoir votre attention,
Mr. Ryland...
Securité !
Arretez cet homme !
Protége Ryland.
Restez ici, je reviens.
Il nous faut une ambulance!
Reculez s'il vous plait! Reculez-vous! Allez reculez!
Hey!
Arrétez! T.J.
Que quelqu'un fasse sortir ces photographes.
Restez là bas.
Je ne comprends pas ce que j'ai fait.
Quelqu'un peut-il m'expliquer ce que je viens de faire?
Tenez bon, Dennis. L'ambulance arrive.
Oui, c'était elle.
Le sang retrouvé sur la scène du crime correspond à son ADN.
C'était bien T.J. Kim qui s'est enfuie du tribunal.
Quand elle est arrivée ici, T.J. a plongé
tous les hommes du bâtiment dans une rage meutrière.
Maintenant c'est comme si elle avait changé un seul homme..
Elle est en train d'apprendre à contrôler ce qu'elle fait.
Ils le font tous.
Depuis que nous avons arreté l'inhibiteur,
Soit ils développent des capacités soit
ils affinent celles qu'ils avaient déjà.
Donc ils deviennent de plus en plus dangereux.
Je suppose que Ryland avait raison.
- J'en ferai sûrement part à ma fille.
- Un point partout, on arrête là.
A ce moment précis, nous avons deux missions.
Nous traquons T.J. Kim.
Quelle est la deuxième mission?
Nous allons protéger les co-conspirateurs
de Ryland contre d'autres représailles.
Alors nous les arrêtons, et maintenant
nous voilà leurs gardes du corps?
Le pays tout entier vient de
voir une 4400 transformer
une audience gouvernementale en film gore.
Si T.J. s'en prend à nouveau à Ryland,
ou à l'un d'entre eux, avant que nous l'ayons arrêtée,
les gens vont commencer à se demander si le gouvernement
des USA est capable de protéger ses citoyens,
Et ce sera le début du chaos.
Au boulot, s'il vous plait.
Tom...
Au cas où tu te le demanderais, Dennis
est toujours en chirurgie.
Il disent qu'il est dans un état délicat.
C'est bon. Donne moi tes mains.
Essaie de détendre. Relax.
Ca va mieux?
Bien mieux.
Pour l'instant..
Quand c'est arrivé, c'était triste,
mais au moins elle était en bonne santé.
Maintenant elle a du diabète, de l'amphisème...
Chaque jour il y a quelque chose d'autre.
Je viendrai l'aider chaque jour.
Ecoutez, tout le monde y travaille.
Nous allons y arriver.
- Ma mère va bien ?
- Euh, oui.
Elle a eu un petit problème.
Shawn s'en est occupé.
Tout est dans les poignets.
Je peux la voir ?
S'il-vous-plait ?
Maman ?
Isabelle.
Viens là.
Y a-t-il quelque chose que je puisse faire?
Non, je ... je vais bien.
Vraiment.
Assieds toi.
Tu étais un si beau bébé.
J'avais l'habitude de te porter toute la journée.
Je savais exactement ce que tu ressentais.
Ce que tu voulais.
- Nous étions si proches.
- Désolée d'avoir grandi si vite.
Je n'en avais pas l'intention.
Je ne voulais pas.
Moi non plus.
Le plus fou est que je continue de penser à Patty,
La femme de Ryland.
J'ai le sentiment que je devrais l'appeler,
l'aider à traverser tout ça.
Peut-être le devrais-tu.
Toi et Ryland étiez amis depuis longtemps.
C'est normal d'être en conflit.
Bien, la petite expérience de Ryland vous aura presque tué.
Shawn, aussi.
Le gars savait que Kyle traquait
Jordan Collier et il n'a rien fait.
Je dirais que ça forge l'amitié.
Tu as tant de choses en tête.
Kyle, Ryland, les 4400...
J'ai besoin de t'éloigner d'ici.
Loin de tes problèmes.
Oui, ça parait intéressant
mais je ne peux aller nulle part.
Je commence une enquête au matin.
Et si je te disais que je peux
t'emmener loin d'ici de temps en temps?
Mon don.
Depuis que je n'ai plus l'inhibiteur...
Je pense pouvoir le contrôler maintenant.
Quoi, tu veux dire que tu veux...
Tu veux m'emmener dans
un autre monde imaginaire?
Une réalité alternative...
Je ne sais même pas comment appeler ça
Appelle ça un repos.
Une semaine, un an...
Aussi longtemps que nous le voudrons.
Tout cela en l'espace d'un instant.
On essaye ?
Ici ?
Maintenant ?
Eh bien...
Que devons-nous faire?
Nous y sommes déjà.
- Il n'y a personne sur la plage.
- Elle est toute à nous, Thomas.
Ainsi que l'hôtel.
Et nous pouvons y rester autant que nous le voulons.
- Il n'y a pas de décalage horaire.
- Ca semble parfait.
Ca me semble parfait à moi aussi.
14 octobre
La porte est ouverte. Entrez.
Quoi ? Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
- Oh, tu es nue.
- Je suis plus à l'aise ainsi.
Je n'en ai pas encore pris l'habitude.
Les vêtements.
J'ai un peignoir.
C'est mieux?
Presque.
Je n'ai jamais rencontré quiconque qui lisait
l'encyclopédie du début à la fin.
- Oh, je n'ai pas fini.
- Nous te les avons livrées hier.
Ok, tu lis rapidement.
C'est vraiment chouette.
Euh, ils t'attendent aux labos.
Tu as un heure de retard.
Ils t'ont envoyé me chercher?
Tu dois t'en occuper?
Bien, oui, plus ou moins.
Tu sais, je vais là où on a besoin de moi.
Ils avaient peur de moi, n'est ce pas?
- Plutôt oui.
- C'est pas grave.
Je pense que même mes parents ont peur de moi.
Je ne crois pas que ton père et ta mère ont peur de toi.
Je pense qu'ils sont perdus.
Je ne leur en veux pas.
Je suis comme ça aussi.
Je.....
ne comprends pas ce qui m'est arrivé.
Ni ce qui est arrivé à ma mère.
Et j'essaie de lire et d'apprendre des choses mais..
Surtout, je...
Je me sens toujours perdue.
Maintenant tu se sens comme une vraie 4400.
Mais je ne suis pas une 4400..
Pas comme ma mère et mon père...
Ou toi.
On dirait que je vais vivre.
Désolé de te decevoir Tom.
Pourquoi as-tu demandé à me voir, Dennis?
J'ai entendu que toi et Skouris étiez en charge
de l'enquête.
Ouai, nous savons qui a fait ça.
Nous la trouverons.
T.J. Kim a attaqué ce batiment il y a 6 semaines.
Personne n'a encore reussi à la localiser.
Nous avons eu du mal
à nettoyer ton bordel, Dennis.
Tu n'as même pas pensé
qu'elle pouvait être aidée.
D'autres 4400 qui détestent
le gouvernement comme elle?
Quand nous l'attraperons, nous lui demanderons.
Tu es sûr ?
Je veux que tu t'occupes de ça jusqu'a la fin, Tom.
De la même façon que quand
tu en avais après moi.......
Et je veux que mes associés soient protégés.
Ils agissaient sous mes ordres.
- Ils sont sous protection.
Ainsi que le tribunal l'était quand Kim a attaqué.
Je me sentirais mieux si tu les ramenais ici.
Nous avons offert un abri à chaque conspirateur.
Aucun n'en a voulu.
Je suppose que personne n'a voulu coopérer
avec l'organisation,
Qui t'a conduit en prison.
On a même essayer de les convaincre de mettre des agents
devant leur maison.
Crockett !
T'es prêt pour pour aller faire un tour, mon garçon ?
Allez, Crockett.
C'est parti.
Ils ne voulaient pas de notre aide.
Ils semblaient certains que T.J. Kim agissait seule.
Crockett ?
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ? C'est moi.
On a remis ça il y a 15 minutes.
C'est un message du groupe Nova.
Nous sommes une cellule défensive des 4400.
Aujourd'hui, le monde a vu ce qui arrive à ceux
qui essayent de nous tuer.
Une seconde démonstration de nos capacités
est prévue pour le 19 Octobre.
- Une nouvelle ère est sur le point d'apparaitre.
- Cellule défensive, huh?
Qu'est-ce qui arrive quand ils décident d'attaquer?
- Je suppose qu'on va le découvrir dans 5 jours.
- Ils n'ont même pas dit ce qu'ils voulaient.
Pas de demande, pas de place pour un compromis.
On ne sait même pas combien de 4400
sont dans ce groupe.
On n'a pas pu en gérer un seul quand
elle a attaqué ce bâtiment.
Maintenant, il y a une équipe entière
d'assassins avec chacun un don ?
Ils détiennent quelqu'un qui peut te tuer rien
qu'en baissant la température de ton corps.
- N'oubliez pas celui qui contrôle les animaux.
- Quoi ?
Quoi ? Ce chien s'est enragé très rapidement.
Bien, j'ai parcouru tous les fichiers,
et aucun de ces dons n'a été enregistré.
Ils ne prennent plus d'inhibiteur maintenant.
On ne peut pas prétendre
Avoir une liste étendue de
tout ce qu'ils peuvent faire.
Personne ne se sent...
un peu dépassé ici ?
Vous vous rappelez de Gary Navarro?
Hey, Gary.
Ca fait lontemps.
Vous avez raison, Baldwin.
Je pense vraiment que
vous deux m'avez trahi.
Ca m'a vraiment dérangé un moment,
Mais à présent je sais que c'est juste
la procédure règlementaire.
Bien, je suppose que ce truc de lecture
de pensées marche plutôt bien, huh?
Mieux que jamais, en fait.
Les aptitudes télépathiques de Gary
ont été très utiles à la NSA.
Ils nous l'ont laissé pour
l'enquête sur le groupe Nova.
Donc on est bien d'accord sur ce qu'on fait là ?
Vous voulez utiliser un 4400 pour localiser un autre 4400.
- Ca te pose un problème ?
- Pas du tout.
Ce ne sera pas la première fois.
Alors...
on peut commencer?
Jamais entendu parler du groupe Nova.
Pas avant ce matin en tout cas.
Je vais devoir aller à la télévision
et expliquer à chacun,
Que le centre n'a rien à voir avec ça.
Je sais qu'il y a un passé tumultueux
entre le NTAC et cet endroit,
Mais j'ai besoin que tu réalise
combien c'est important.
Crois moi, si je savais quelque chose,
je te le dirais.
Bien, ca te dérange si on fait
le tour du centre, questionner des gens ?
Vous et votre animal liseur de pensées ?
Non, je peux pas vous laisser faire ça.
Ces gens n'ont rien fait de mal et je ne vais pas
vous laisser troubler leur intimité,
Je n'arrive pas croire que vous ayez
ramené ce type ici encore une fois...
Combien vous paient-ils pour espionner ceux
de votre propre espèce ? Obtenir de bonnes infos ?
Voyez-vous quoique ce soit
qui vous intéresse ici ?
Pour autant que je puis dire,
il ne cache rien.
J'ai beaucoup à faire. Si j'apprends quelque chose,
je vous passe un coup de fil.
Pour l'instant, c'est tout que je peux faire.
Désolé pour mon neveu.
Pourquoi ?
- Il a été un peu dur avec vous là-bas.
J'entends çà tous les jours.
Je n'y fais pas attention.
Vous permettez que je vous demande...
Vous sous-entendez que vous avez pourchassé
des 4400 dans le passé.
Qu'est-ce vous faisiez exactement pour la NSA?
Des trucs à l'étranger, la plupart du temps.
Mais comme quoi ?
Donnez moi un exemple.
Ils m'envoient quelque part.
J'approche la cible,
découvre ce qu'elle pense,
Ensuite je le dis aux gens qui m'emploient puis ils
me raménent chez moi, où je vis confortablement.
Qu'est-ce qui arrive à la cible ?
Je ne demande pas.
C'est bien.
Les comparaisons des liaisons neuronales
sont très claires.
Assurez-vous que vous compreniez
tout avant de continuer.
Dr. Burkhoff, je ne comprends rien à tout ça.
Un bon nombre de ses neurones ne fonctionnent plus
A chaque fois qu'un de ses neurones disparait,
un des miens apparait.
Exactement.
Et ce qui est vrai pour les neurones est vrai pour
les cellules musculaires, liaisons synaptiques...
Il y a une...
parfaite correspondance entre le nombre
que vous perdez et le nombre que vous gagnez.
Tout ça n'est juste une manière de dire
que c'est moi qui lui fait ça?
La corrélation est trop précise pour être aléatoire.
Ton vieillissement prématuré
a causé votre vieillissement.
Comment peut-on arrêter ça ?
Comment me faire revenir comme j'étais avant?
- J'ai bien peur de ne pas en être capable.
- Alors, qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Il est possible que, si la cause du viellissement
est éliminée, Lily redevienne comme avant.
- La cause du vieillisement ?
- Il veut dire moi.
Je suis en train de te tuer.
Le seul moyen pour toi de vivre est que je meurs ?
Ne répondez pas à ca, Dr. Burkhoff.
Merci pour votre temps. Nous en avons fini ici.
Où vas-tu ?
On ne va pas parler de ça.
Pas maintenant. Jamais.
- C'est vrai, hein?
- Je crois bien.
Mais ce n'est qu'une théorie.
Les gars, j'ai passé six semaines
avec des gars en uniforme.
Bah voyons.
Je suis sorti deux fois avec T.J Kim.
Ensuite, j'ai arrêté.
- La fille avait trop de bagages.
- Combien de temps cela fait-il ?
Euh, il y a deux mois?
Ecoutez, si j'avais su que des agents du gouvernement
allaient venu me voir
pour me poser des questions sur elle,
J'aurais pris des notes.
Hey, alors ecoutez.
Tous ces trucs à propos du 19 octobre,
vous pensez que c'est sérieux?
Vous pensez que je devrais quitter la ville ?
Pour autant qu'on sache, tu es en sécurité ici
comme dans n'importe quel autre endroit.
Ce gosse mentait.
Ou du moins, il ne vous disait pas toute la vérité.
Pendant que vous lui parliez,
il pensait à une adresse.
331 Reynolds Avenue.
Je pense que c'est bon.
Personne n'est là.
Personne n'est venu depuis un moment,
à mon avis.
Regarde ça.
C'est le rapport du gouvernement
sur le retour des 4400.
J'ai essayé de le lire une fois.
J'ai pas reussi.
Ouais. On dirait que quelqu'un a reussi à le lire
jusqu'à la fin.
Mensonges !
Wesley hauser.
Wesley hauser.
Wesley hauser.
Qui est donc ce Wesley Hauser?
Hauser était un marine.
Il a servi deux ans au Vietnam.
Il menait des protestations contre la guerre
après qu'il est rentré en 72. Disparu en 75.
Une fois sorti de la quarantaine,
il n'est plus jamais revenu nous voir.
Le gars vit en solitaire depuis presque plus de deux ans.
Ce qui signifie qu'il n'a jamais pris l'inhibiteur,
donc qui sait de quoi il est capable aujourd'hui.
Hauser était déçu par le gouvernement
avant de disparaître,
Je ne pense pas qu'on fait tout ce qu'on peut
pour le retrouver depuis qu'il est revenu.
Quand il était en quarantaine, il était dans le quartier 3.
Le même batiment que T.J. Kim.
Un agitateur. Un organisateur.
Un extremiste.
On dirait qu'on détient notre second membre du
groupe Nova.
Baldwin.
Vous plaisantez ?
Très bien. Je sais. Passez le moi.
- Il dit qu'il est Wesley Hauser.
- Pas possible.
- Ouais, salut.
- Comment avez-vous trouvé mon appartement?
Bien, pour être honnête,
il semblait un peu vide sans vous.
J'ai un emploi du temps très chargé.
Beaucoup à faire avant la semaine prochaine.
On dirait que vous avez des projets intéressants,
Pourquoi ne conviendrait-on pas d'un lieu, pour en parler ?
Arrêtez votre barratin.
Il n'y a rien à dire.
Votre époque est finie.
La notre commence le 19 octobre.
Allez, laissez-moi partir.
Pourquoi est-ce que tu as couru
quand on t'a parler de Hauser, huh?
Vous mangiez ensemble à la cantine.
On l'a vu sur la vidéo.
Alors ? Le gars connaissaient pas mal d'histoires de guerre.
Ca ne fait pas de nous les meilleurs amis du monde.
Alors pourquoi t'es-tu enfuis ?
Parce que quand je vois des agents du NTAC,
je change de trottoir.
Vous nous avez presque tous tués.
Vous me le reprochez ?
Tourne-toi.
Tourne-toi.
- Je peux partir ?
- Dégage d'ici.
J'avoue être sensible,
mais j'ai envie de lui dire..
"On a découvert l'inhibiteur.
On a sauvé votre vie."
Vous ne comprenez vraiment pas, hein?
Il ne s'agit pas que de cet homme.
Chaque 4400 à qui on a parlé aujourd'hui
avait peur de vous
Ou ne vous fait pas confiance ou vous hait.
Ecoutez, je suis désolé,
mais les jours où vous pouviez avoir
Des conversations amicales avec ces gens
n'existent plus.
Vous êtes les méchants maintenant.
Habituez vous y.
Je te préviens juste
que la maternité n'est pas facile.
Depuis quand es-tu un expert ?
Je dis juste qu'elle a mis au monde des jumeaux.
C'est une grosse responsabilité...
Surtout quand elle essaye de recupérer
son salaire d'enseignant.
- Comment vas-tu les appelés?
- Je n'ai plus vraiment envie de jouer.
- C'est pas grave
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, ma puce?
Rien, sauf...
que je sais que Marco va gagner,
je vais être seconde,
Et que tu vas finir seule et sans argent.
Il est plus intelligent que vous,
mais maman vous préfère vous.
- Alors, euh, Q-qui est plus intelligent que moi?
- Qui sait?
Je ne suis même pas certaine
qu'elle le sache réellement.
Tu sais, d'une certaine manière,
elle allait mieux avant de prendre l'inhibiteur.
Au moins elle n'était pas cinglée
quand elle est revenue.
Tout ce qu'elle veut faire c'est noter
dans son journal tout ce qu'elle voit.
C'est comme une sorte de compulsion.
Bien...
Réfléchis-y une minute.
Chaque matin elle se reveille et..
sait presque tout ce qui va arriver.
Elle vit déjà la journée entière dans sa tête,
Et quand quelque chose arrive,
c'est comme une rediffusion.
- Je déteste regarder les rediffusions.
- Ouai. Essaye d'en vivre une.
Hey, et Kevin Burkhoff?
Peut-être qu'il pourrait trouver un moyen
pour que Maia puisse contrôler ses visions.
Il est brillant.
Je ne dis pas ça de tout le monde,
mais il est plus intelligent que moi.
- Je vous connais.
- Biensûr. Je suis Diana Skouris.
- Vous travaillez au NTAC.
- Je ne suis pas là pour le travail.
Je suis là au sujet de ma fille, Maia.
La voyante.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a ?
Elle a encore 10 ans, hein?
Elle n'a pas 65 ans maintenant, non?
Suggestion intéressante.
Cependant, un peu hors sujet.
Bien.
Vous feriez bien de rentrer.
Merci.
- Oh, désolé pour le désordre.
- C'est pas grave.
J'ai viré la bonne la semaine dernière.
Elle était toujours en train de nettoyer.
Excusez-moi.
Alors...
Votre fille.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
15 Octobre.
Vas-y.
C'est à cause de moi tout ça, hein?
Et se débarasser de moi
est la seule façon de la sauver.
- Non...
- C'est ce à quoi tu pensais, hein?
Non, c'est pas vrai.
Je ne veux pas non plus qu'elle meure.
Donc vas-y.
- Je ne regarderai pas.
- Isabelle...
Je ne te ferai jamais de mal.
Pourquoi ?
Je ne comprend pas.
C'est le seul moyen de la sauver.
On n'en sait rien
et je ne choisirai pas entre vous deux.
Tu veux pas ou tu ne peux pas?
Désolé.
Je ne voulais pas envahir l'espace de quelqu'un.
Oh, c'est bon.
Ce bureau ne m'appartient pas.
Mais on dirait que tu es là pour un moment, hein?
Si cet endroit est encore debout le 20 Octobre, oui.
Peut-être qu'on devrait parler à Jarvis.
Pour que vous ayez votre propre bureau.
Ca ne me dérange pas.
A dire vrai, je pourrais utiliser
un simple coin de table.
Ce problème avec votre fille...
Le don de voyance ?
Je voulais vous donner mon avis,
mais je ne veux pas paraitre indiscret.
Alors vous le faites...
Vous lisez dans mes pensées...
Pour vous et Baldwin.
Je ne peux rien y faire.
J'ai essayé de vous mettre d'accord mais
à chaque fois il y avait quelque chose bloquait.
Je tâcherai de m'en souvenir.
Vous avez dit que vous aviez une opinion sur Maia.
Quelle est-elle ?
Quand au début...
J'ai dévéloppé ce truc,
J'étais très enervé. Vous m'avez vu.
Je pensais reellement que j'allais devenir fou,
donc je luttais contre ça.
Et ca n'a fait qu'empirer.
Donc j'ai renoncé.
Et j'ai laissé ce truc me contrôler.
Et ensuite j'ai progressivement
appris à le contrôler.
Ecoutez, votre fille arrête de lutter,
et éventuellement
cela deviendra comme voir ou entendre,
ou un autre sens.
Elle n'y pensera même plus.
C'est juste une partie d'elle même.
C'est ainsi que ça a marché pour moi, en tout cas.
Merci.
Diana. La police de Seattle vient d'appeler.
Quelqu'un de là-bas a lu notre avis de recherche.
Ils savent exactement où est Hauser.
Vous êtes chanceux, en fait.
D'ici un jour ou deux, nous aurions dû
l'enterrer dans la fausse commune.
- Enterrer qui ?
- Lui.
Je lis toujours les avis de recherche quand
ils circulent dans le département de police.
Une sorte de passe-temps.
Ca devient ennuyeux ici.
Bref. Dans le signalement, il y avait une
description d'un tatouage régimentaire pour Hauser.
La 82e aéroportée.
"La mort vue d'en haut."
Je me suis rappelé ce signe sur un corps
non identifié apporté il y a 3 semaines.
Ce gars s'était noyé dans le port.
- Beaucoup de vétérans portent ce tatouage.
Est-ce que beaucoup de vétérans ressemblent
à la photo d'identité que vous faisiez circuler ?
Vous ne me croyez pas ?
Regardez par vous-même.
Dites bonjour à Wesley Hauser.
Hauser est mort il y a 2 semaines et demi,
avant que Ryland ne soit attaqué.
Manifestement, ce n'était pas
lui au téléphone l'autre jour.
Et cette copie du rapport des 4400
avec toutes ces notes dessus?
D'après ce qu'on sait, c'est peut-être un agent infiltré.
Quelqu'un veut détourner notre attention.
Ils nous ont délibérément mis sur la piste
d'un membre fantôme du groupe Nova.
Je veux dire,
comment a-t-on appris au début pour Hauser ?
L'ancien petit ami de T.J. Il nous a donné l'adresse.
Non, il y pensait.
Du moins, selon Gary, il l'a fait.
Gary Navarro nous a mis sur la piste de Wesley Hauser.
Montes.
Vous m'avez menti, Daniel.
Vous n'avez jamais rien dit à propos de tuer des gens.
Nous vous avons protégé, Shawn.
Si nous vous l'avions dit avant,
vous auriez été coupable.
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ici ?
- Elle est en train de mourir. Elle a besoin de votre aide.
Je vous l'ai dit, je ne veux
plus rien à voir à faire avec vous désormais.
Le groupe Nova était censé nous protéger.
C'est pourquoi je vous ai donné de l'argent, Daniel.
C'est pourquoi je vous ai donné de l'argent.
Pas pour lancer une organisation terroriste !
Nous parlerons de vos inquiétudes plus tard.
Elle a une blessure à l'estomac qui s'est infectée.
Elle a besoin de vous maintenant, ou elle ne tiendra pas.
Shawn, c'est une 4400.
Si nous ne nous aidons pas les uns les autres,
quel espoir avons-nous?
Donnez-moi votre main.
Que faites-vous ici?
Vous êtes réveillé.
Bien.
C'est important que vous sachiez que c'était moi.
Je suis l'homme qui vous a tué.
Poste Médical.
Avez-vous une vue sur Gary Navarro?
Oui, il vient juste de partir.
Pourquoi ?
- Attrapez-le !
- Hey! Arrêtez-vous!
Vas-y. Je vais surveillez Ryland.
Il fait une crise.
Sa tension chûte.
J'ai besoin d'une table d'urgence et de l'Ativan.
Trouvé le Dr. Danoff. Tout de suite !
Trouvez le Dr. Danoff. Tout de suite!
Isabelle.
Isabelle!
Oh, mon dieu !
Que quelqu'un appelle une ambulance !
Qu'est-ce que vous attendez ?
Que quelqu'un appelle une ambulance !
Ils sont en route !
- Que quelqu'un appelle une ambulance...
- Papa...
Qu'est-ce que je suis ?
C'est un miracle, Shawn.
Je te vois guérir quelqu'un, et...
Je me demande bien pourquoi
ils nous détestent tant.
Ils nous détestent parce que vous les tuez,
Daniel.
Ils ont peur de nous.
Je ne peux pas leur en vouloir.
Tu dis cela comme si on agissait par soif de sang.
C'était des frappes précises et tactiques, Shawn.
Et toi et tous les autres 4400 êtes en fin de compte
plus en sécurité grâce à eux.
Vous avez tué des gens. Ce n'est pas ce dont
on avait convenu quand vous m'avez approché.
Je vous ai donné de l'argent pour lancer
une défense armée pour le centre dans le cas où
le gouvernement en avait encore après nous.
C'était une précaution.
Et tout ce que nous avons fait
était des mesures préventives.
Shawn, tu penses que, parce que
leur programme inhibiteur
a été dévoilé, que le gouvernement
va nous laisser en paix ?
Non, ils savent que nous sommes devenus plus puissant,
ce qui menace leur maintien au pouvoir,
et qui augmente leur besoin de nous éliminer.
- Donc on frappe les premiers ?
C'est ça?
C'est ce qu'il va se passer le 19 ?
Ecoute, Shawn, tu fais un grand travail à ton centre.
Tu dois te focaliser dessus. Je ne veux pas te distraire.
La connaissance peut être un fardeau.
Et merci d'avoir aider T.J.
Tu es un héros pour les tiens.
Ne l'oublie jamais.
Ouais.
Cela n'a pas marché, tu sais. Ryland a fait une overdose,
mais les docteurs l'ont sorti de là.
Il se réveillera d'ici quelques heures.
- Bien, je suis sûr que tu es déçu autant que moi.
Ne t'en fait pas.
On l'aura.
Parles nous de Wesley Hauser.
Tu l'as rencontré pour la première fois en quarantaine.
J'aimais bien Wes. Il était un peu cinglé,
mais il n'était pas fou pour autant.
Je crois qu'il était bipolaire ou un truc dans le genre,
mais je ne l'ai jamais vu prendre de médicaments.
Après la quarantaine, il vivait dans la rue.
J'allais le voir de temps en temps aux docks.
Lui donnez un peu de nourriture, un peu d'argent.
Donc quand as-tu décidé de le tuer ?
- Wes, il n'a pas eu besoin de mon aide pour ça.
Il buvait au moins 3 bouteilles par jour.
Un matin, il y a environ un mois,
j'étais allé le voir, et...
Je l'ai trouvé dans la décharge.
Mort.
Et au mileu de ta période de deuil,
tu as pensé que Hauder ferait un très bon appât.
Hauser s'en serait moquer.
Je veux dire, il détestait les gens comme vous
qui fouinez dans sa période chez les marines..
Donc quand je l'ai trouvé, j'ai dit un mot
ou deux en sa mémoire,
et je l'ai poussé dans la baie Elliot.
Alors depuis combien de temps
travailles-tu avec ce groupe Nova?
Quelqu'un t'a approché ou c'était ton idée ?
Dis moi...
Toi et ta petite amie...
Vous êtes comme dans un jeu de rôle
ou en fait elle t'emmène dans ce...
Je ne sais pas. Comment appelles-tu ça?
Monde imaginaire?
Oh, et ce gars Marco...
Il sait que tu es trop...
embarassée de dire à ton partenaire
que vous deux sortez ensemble ?
Tu frimes ?
Pourquoi tu nous ne dis pas
ce qu'il va se passer le 19 octobre?
Je crois que vous allez devoir vous
trouver un autre télépathe.
Bonne chance.
Donc vous n'avez rien obtenu de lui ?
Bien, il nous a dit pour Hauser,
mais tant que le groupe Nova agira,
il va falloir du temps pour le forcer à parler.
Combien de temps ?
C'est un télépathe. Il sait ce que nous pensons.
- Un peu plus que d'habitude.
- Ok, donc ce n'est pas facile,
mais Gary Navarro est
dans une zone de sécurité de niveau 7.
En supposant qu'il se sert de ça pour
toutes les informations données au groupe Nova,
on a besoin de savoir ce qu'il sait. Maintenant.
- Il va parler.
Gary a été dans nos têtes pendant un an.
Je pense que je sais comment rentrer dans la sienne.
Attention avec ça.
- Matthew.
Je ne m'attendais pas
à te revoir avant 2 semaines.
Le groupe Nova a modifié mon calendrier.
Il l'a complétement changé, en fait.
Il est difficile de faire
pression au nom des 4400,
quand certains d'entre eux se vantent
à propos du comptage des morts.
Je suppose.
Commnent va Lily ?
Une quelconque amélioration depuis que je suis parti ?
- Non, elle va de plus en plus mal.
- Je suis désolé de l'entendre.
Isabelle?
Elle a essayé de se suicider ce matin.
Elle a sauté du toit.
Et quelques minutes plus tard, elle
marchait comme si rien ne s'était passé.
Je vais te dire, Matthew... Je ne vais pas te mentir.
Je suis très content que tu sois revenu.
Bonjour, Isabelle.
Salut. Qui êtes-vous ?
Je m'appelle Matthew Ross.
Je travaille étroitement avec Shawn.
Je suis conseiller pour les 4400.
Puis-je entrer ?
J'ai cru comprendre qu'il y a eu
un incident ce matin.
Tu as essayé...
de te faire du mal.
Je vois.
Tu n'avais pas le droit de faire ça !
Tu ne comprends pas qui tu es ?
Ce que tu dois faire ici ?
- Non...
- Bien, moi je sais.
Je sais tout sur toi, Isabelle.
Je sais pourquoi tu es ici, et je sais
ce que tu es censée faire.
Assis-toi...
et je vais te raconter une histoire.
Tu va l'aimer. C'est à propos de ton passé,
et de ton futur.
Je sais que que tu as rencontré
beaucoup de problèmes pour obtenir cela.
Merci.
Mais ?
Je ne suis pas sûre de vouloir envoyer Maia
dans cette école où on enseigne qu'à des 4400.
Cela ressemble à un bon moyen pour l'écarter
encore plus du reste du monde.
Ecoutes, juste...
Essaye pendant une seconde de penser comme si cela
n'avait rien à voir avec les 4400. C'est une bonne école.
Tu sais, la faculté de première classe,
les installations sont grandes, et tout est gratuit.
Le centre des 4400 prend tout en charge.
Ils ont même une classe sur
comment contrôler tes capacités.
Donne-moi un peu de temps pour y réfléchir, ok ?
C'est important.
J'aurais espérer que Dr Burkiff veuille ......
Je ne sais pas, une pilule magique
ou un truc dans le genre.
Sur quoi travaille-t-il ?
Quelque chose d'intéressant ?
Tu sais ce sérum de promicine qu'il a
inventé et qui a sauvé tout le monde ?
J'ai vu une seringue là-bas,
et j'ai l'impression qu'ils y en avaient dedans.
Bien, c'est un chercheur, non ? Il doit probablement
l'injecter dans..., dans des souris, des cochons ?
Les seuls animaux que j'ai vu là-bas
étaient un couple de cafars.
Tu ne penses tout de même pas qu'il se l'injecte ?
C'est ridicule. Je ne m'injecte pas le
sérum de promicine.
Bien. Je suis contente de l'entendre.
Je m'injecte une version
modifiée de ce sérum.
Dr. Burkhoff, je doit vous le demander.
Avez-vous arrêter de prendre vos médicaments ?
Bien sûr que non. Je suis aussi sain que vous l'êtes.
Une fois que le traitement sera fini,
je devrais apprendre à mon corps
comment produire la promicine,
et puis je deviendrais le premier non-disparu
à développer des capacités comme les 4400.
Le premier de beaucoup.
Vous parlez de la prochaine
étape dans l'évolution humaine.
- Vous pensez que le monde est prêt pour ça ?
- Le monde n'est jamais prêt pour changer.
On doit l'y forcer. Ce n'est pas la raison
pour laquele les 4400 ont été ramenés ?
N'est-ce pas ce pourquoi le futur m'a réveillé ?
Vous ne devriez pas faire des recherches de
cette ampleur dans, excusez-moi, mais...
Dans une décheterie.
Ce sont des conditions de travail à peine stérile.
Vous pouvez m'aidez.
Vous êtes une scientifique dans le fond, n'est-ce pas ?
- J'ai une licence en microbiologie et épidemiologie.
- Bien.
Ca sera utile.
J'ai besoin de quelqu'un pour suivre mes progrés.
Comme les changements...
En continue.
Changements ?
Je pense que c'est une première étape enthousiasmante,
vous ne trouvez pas ?
Je pensais, que la prochaine fois, nous pourrions faire
un monde où Kyle n'a jamais tiré sur Jordan Collier,
n'est jamais allé en prison, où le scandale
de l'inhibiteur n'a jamais eu lieu...
Ça a l'air cool..
Mais je dois te dire, que pour le moment,
je ne ressens pas vraiment le besoin d'être
transporté dans une sorte de monde imaginaire.
Aussi longtemps que cette eau reste chaude,
tout va bien bien pour moi en ce moment dans la réalité.
Peut-être que demain nous pourrons réessayer.
Je devrai remettre ça à un autre jour.
Je vais à un seminaire
au centre des 4400 demain.
C'est à propos de ce qu'on peut s'attendre physiquement
maintenant que l'on nous a retirer l'inhibiteur.
Est-ce que tout va bien ?
Je veux dire, tu n'as aucun problème ?
Non, je me sens bien.
Je me sens très bien, en fait.
Bien, mais je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi tu as besoin d'y aller ?
Je n'en ai pas besoin. Je veux y aller.
Je suis curieuse.
Mais alana, tu n'as...tu n'as jamais voulu aller
au centre avant. Pourqoui commencer maintenant ?
Je n'avais jamais ressentis le besoin
d'être entourer d'autres 4400 auparavant.
Et maintenant si ?
C'est juste un séminaire, Thomas.
Oui, ok.
Je comprends.
16 octobre.
Tu reconnais ces noms ?
Ce sont des 4400, tous des étrangers.
Alessandro Ortiz du Venezuela.
Ismael Namir de Libye.
Chitra Singh d'Indonésie.
Ils ont tous disparus l'an dernier.
Voilà un an.
C'est à peu près depuis ce moment que tu
travailles pour la NSA, n'est-ce pas, Gary ?
Nous avons vérifié tes voyages.
Tu as quitté le Vénézuela 2 jours avant qu'Ortiz disparaisse.
La même chose en Lybie, en Indonésie...Tous ceux sur la liste.
Tu étais là-bas, lorsqu'ils ont disparus.
Qu'est-ce que tu as exactement fait pour la NSA, Gary ?
Il y a une course à l'armement qui continue, n'est-ce pas ?
Mais maintenant il faut compter avec les 4400.
Ces gens, je parie que leur capacité
rendait les mauvaises personnes vraiment nerveuses.
Et la NSA ne pouvait rester sans rien faire pendant que
des gouvernements étrangers
et potentiellement hostiles développaient, quoi,
une arme humaine de destruction massive ?
Est-ce que cette liste est complète ? Parce que
je voudrais juste savoir combien de 4400 tu as tué.
Je n'ai tué personne.
Oh, non, non, non, tu as juste mis
les bonnes personnes au bon endroit.
Puisque, tu rentrais chez toi.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
Oh, oui.
"Très confortablement" quand le travail habituel était fini.
Et c'est pourquoi tu es passé
par le groupe nova, n'est-ce pas, Gary ?
Parce que tu ne pouvais plus vivre avec toi-même.
La NSA m'a dit que j'aidais mon pays.
Ils n'ont pas rempli les cases manquantes.
Je devais faire cela moi-même.
Tu t'es senti manipulé.
Il ont crée une arme contre les gens
comme toi. Donc quand tu l'as découvert...
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? C'est qui ces gars ?
Voici l'agent Wood et le Dr. Boll du NSA.
Ils ont envoyés pour que vous accélérez l'interrogatoire.
Ok, pour commencer, tu t'assieds plus.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Envoyés par qui ?
Gary navarro a essayé de me tuer.
J'ai passé un coup de fil.
Tu devrais être en prison normalement, Dennis.
J'ai encore de nombreux amis, Tom.
Je l'avais mis en confiance. Je faisais des progrès.
Pas assez rapidement.
Les membres du groupe de Gary savant qu'il a été pris.
Ils ont déjà changé leur plans.
Si on met trop de temps à recupérer des informations,
elles deviennent sans intérêt.
Le 19 ocotbre est dans trois jours.
Ouais.
Je sais que tu trouves ça dur à croire Tom,
mais on est du même côté.
Nous avons le même but.
Ces agents sont ouvragés.
Utilises-les.
Tu es assis à ma place.
- Désolé.
- C'est bon.
Il y a de la place pour deux ici.
Tu lis Staline , Pol Pot, et Le marquis de Sade ?
T'as fini tous les bons livres ?
Eh bien, je m'intéresse plus à apprendre sur le mal.
Tout le monde a peur de moi, donc j'ai pensé.
Et s'ils avaient raison ?
Et si j'étais mal ?
Pourquoi tu penserais ça ?
Parfois je sens quelque chose à
l'intérieur de moi, comme si....
J'étais capable de tout.
Tout le monde est capable de tout.
- Crois-moi, j'en sais quelque chose.
- Comment ?
- T'as fait de mauvaises choses ?
- Ouais, bien sûr que oui.
Tu voudrais m'en dire plus sur elle ?
Um, d'accord.
J'ai couché avec la petite amie de mon frère.
A quel point c'est mal ?
Certains appelerait ça une haute trahison.
Beaucoup de rancunes.
Cette homme a fait des choses pires que ça.
Ben, je ne suis pas un didacteur, mais....
J'ai fait beaucoup de mal aussi.
Je ne peux pas en dire plus,
mais j'ai donné de l'argent à des personnes.
Ils l'ont utilisé pour quelque chose de,
vraiment, vraiment mal et..
- Je ne crois pas qu'ils ont finis.
- Ben, tu peux les arrêter ?
Je pourrais les dénoncer, mais le fait est que,
jusqu'à maintenant, ils ne s'en sont pris
qu'après de mauvaises personnes,
Des personnes qui ont essayé de
me tuer, de nous tuer tous.
Alors s'ils ne s'en prennent
qu'après de mauvaises personnes,
Ca ne fait pas d'eux des gens biens ?
Peut-être. Je ne sais pas.
Nous sommes ensemble, maintenant, non ?
J'ai lu sur ce sujet.
Ouais, en effet.
Comment c'était pour toi ?
J'ai aimé.
Nous avons parlé.
Ca m'a aidé à différencier le bien du mal.
Selon toi, tu dois choisir.
C'est une decision.
J'ai raison, non ?
Ouais, sans doute.
17 Octobre.
Je ne peux pas ouvrir ma main.
J'ai fait une sieste,
et c'était tout replié comme ça.
De l'arthrite, je peux m'en occuper.
Ca fait du bien.
Tu es comme une bouillote humaine...
J'aime ça.
Bouillote humaine...
Je prends ça comme un compliment.
Sérieusement, ça va mieux ?
Ouais.
J'ai échangé des e-mails avec
quelqu'un de la clinique Mayo.
Il dit qu'on devrait aller en Suède,
et essayer ce traitement expérimental.
Tiens.
C'est quoi ?
Ouvre-la.
Tu peux croire que la Air Force
te laisse faire ça maintenant ?
Tu leur donnes de l'argent,
et ils te laissent voler avec un F-16.
Ca dit que je vais prendre les commandes.
Oh, j'ai parlé au gars qui s'occupe du programme,
Et je lui ai parlé de ton passé de pilote,
et il a dit qu'il te laisserait aux commandes 30 secondes.
Lily, j'étais pilote en 1950.
C'est pourquoi ce ne sont que 30 secondes.
Joyeuse anniversaire, Richard.
Merci, mais mon anniversaire n'est que
dans six semaines.
Richard, je ne serais plus là dans six semaines.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Si, j'ai raison.
Toi et moi le savons depuis un moment.
Richard, je suis mourante.
Lily...
Je sais que c'est dur pour toi,
mais tu ne dois pas abandonner.
Shawn a dit qu'il restera avec toi
tous les jours s'il le faut.
Il te gardera en bonne santé.
Il ne peut pas.
Plus maintenant.
Ces gens sont des 4400 ?
Eh bien, certains oui, et certains
auraient souhaité en être un.
Pourquoi ils voudraient ça ?
- Bonjour. Bienvenue au centre.
- Vous êtes un 4400 ?
Non, chérie. Et toi ?
Bien, c'est un honneur de te rencontrer.
Vous êtes ici pour le séminaire ?
- Non, nous sommes ici pour l'école.
- Nous avons un RDV avec Mrs. Tobey.
Je vais la prévenir de votre arrivée.
Pendant ce temps-là, tu pourrais signer
et marquer ta compétence ?
Nous créons une base de données.
Tu es sûre de vouloir faire ça ?
Je veux rencontrer des enfants comme moi.
Mon nom est Alana Mareva.
Je dois admettre que
j'étais plutôt hésitante pour venir
aujourd'hui.
J'étais plutôt chanceuse. Ma vie n'a pas
beaucoup changé quand je suis revenue.
Je n'ai jamais beaucoup pensé
au fait d'être un 4400,
mais quand nous sommes tous tombés malade,
Et de voir tout le monde ensemble en quarantaine...
J'ai senti comme j'avais nié une partie de moi-même,
Alors...
Me voilà ici, et je suis ravie d'être venue.
Rien que tu veuilles me dire ?
Gary...
Finissons-en.
Je te laisserai t'assoire.
Qui t'as contacté en premier ?
Donne-moi juste un nom.
Oh, mec.
Et que dis-tu de ça ?
Le 19 octobre est dans deux jours.
Maintenant, t'as quelque chose à me dire ou pas ?
Comme tu voudras.
Un de nos membres a été compromis.
Je présume qu'il va donner mon nom.
Alors tu m'appelles ?
Autant que je sache, le NTAC surveille la ligne.
Bien, nous allons devoir nous cacher.
Ca va coûter cher.
Tu penses que je vais te signer
un chèque comme ça ?
Tu fais comme tu veux.
J'en ai besoin demain.
Je vois à l'endroit habituel
et à l'heure habituelle.
Nous sommes en guerre,
et nous devons choisir notre camp.
Parle, gary.
Qu'est-ce que tu as à dire, mec ?
Parle!
Parle! Gary.
Je veux des noms.
Donne-moi un nom !
- Parle ! Gary.
- Daniel Armand !
Daniel Armand.
Daniel Armand.
Ok.
C'est un début.
- Qui d'autre ?
- C'est tout. C'était mon seul contact.
Je n'ai rencontré personne d'autre du groupe.
Il nous gardait tous séparés.
Je suis désolé. J'ai du mal
à croire ce que tu dis.
Son pouls est à 210.
Les palpitations montent à 240.
Nous devons attendre.
On veut seulement un nom.
Tu ne peux pas continuer.
Pas avant quelques heures.
On a pas ces quelques heures.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Il est de ma responsabilité.
Non, c'est faux. C'est la nôtre.
Et c'est fini pour aujourd'hui.
Ca va aller, Gary.
Ok, donc il est de retour.
Ce n’est pas comme si on ne s'y attendait pas.
Non.
Du calme.
Il n'approchera pas Isabelle.
Nous le trouverons et nous nous en occuperons.
Vous avez fait une erreur.
Vous vous trompez de personne.
Je dois vous laisser.
Je ne crois pas.
Ces choses que vous m'avez racontées ?
Ces choses que je vais faire ?
Ce n'est pas moi.
J'ai le choix.
Et je ne sais pas qui vous êtes,
et je ne sais pas à quoi vous pensez.
Vous en savez beaucoup sur moi,
mais vous vous trompez.
Isabelle...
Je comprends pourquoi que tu as du mal
à t'adapter. Grandir est si dure.
Mais ne sois pas si dure avec
le messager. Ce n'est pas mon plan.
Je suis juste là pour t'aider à y arriver.
Pour t'aider à atteindre ton vrai potentiel.
Considère-moi comme ton oncle préféré.
Non. Non, je n'ai pas d'oncle.
Je n'ai pas d'oncle,
et je ne ferai pas partie de votre plan.
D'accord.
Tu fais comme tu veux.
Tu peux même essayer de sauver
ta mère si tu veux.
Comment ?
C’est quoi ça ?
Ouvre-la.
Il n'y pas beaucoup de chose qui
puissent te blesser, Isabelle...
Mais ça là, ça fera l'affaire.
Si tu ne peux pas accepter le fait que ta vie
est plus importante que celle de ta mère.
Fais-toi juste une injection.
Tu mourras dans la minute.
Et Lily ?
Qui sait.
Peut-être qu'elle se réveillera
et elle sera de nouveau une jeune femme.
Ca va vraiment la sauver ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est le hasard.
Mais si tu ne peux pas vivre avec toi-même,
alors non.
Désolé pour ça.
Ah. Génial.
Je le savais.
Je savais qu'il me restait
une tasse de propre par-là.
Maintenant, où sont les filtres ?
C'est bon.
Je ne veux pas de café.
J'aurais juré les avoir vu. Ca vous dérange
si je me sers de serviette en papier ?
- Kevin, si je fais ça...
- "Si" vous faites ça ?
Vous le faites déjà.
Vous êtes là, non ?
Si je vous surveille durant cette expérience,
j'ai besoin que vous sachiez une chose....
Si on en arrive à un point où
votre vie est en danger, j'arrête tout.
Je ne vais pas restez planter là et vous regarder mourir.
Bien, je n’espère pas...
Parce que je suis trop précieux.
Je crois que ça va être marrant.
Je n'ai pas vraiment ...
Travaillé avec quelqu'un depuis un moment.
J'attendais ça avec impatience.
Moi aussi.
Alors...
Vous voulez faire une prise de sang ?
18 Octobre.
Nina.
Nous étions juste en bas, le gardien en
fonction nous a dit que Wood avait emmené Gary.
Gary a été transféré à la NSA.
Mais c'est un 4400.
Il est de notre juridiction.
Et quelqu'un du Pentagone a signé un ordre
que nous ne pouvons discuter.
Apparemment, ils pensent que nous manquons
d'expérience pour les interrogatoires.
Et si on leur mettait un micro dans les oreilles ?
Je ne sais pas si c'était Ryland ou pas,
mais nous avons eu notre essai pour Navarro.
Le 19 octobre est demain. Nous sommes à un jour
d'une annonce de menace terroriste.
La NSA pense qu'ils peuvent le faire parler.
Alors où est-ce qu'on peut le prendre ?
- Ils ne m'ont pas fait part de cette information.
- C'est dégeulasse.
C'est le seul endroit dans tous le pays
qui est équipé pour s'occuper des 4400.
Vous croyez que je ne leur ai pas dit ?
Ils n’étaient pas intéressés.
- Isabelle.
- Salut.
Je peux entrer ?
Vous allez quelque part ?
J'ai vu papa mettre des bagages dans la voiture.
Oh, nous allons juste essayer une autre clinique,
mais nous allons partir pour un moment.
Vous voulez que je vienne avec vous ?
Non, ça va aller.
Merci.
Si il y a quelque chose dont tu as besoin,
va voir Shawn.
Il fera attention à toi.
Ok ?
Et..
Je voulais te donner ça.
C'est ma bague de fiançailles.
Je l'ai hérité de ma grand-mère.
Elle s'appelait également Lily.
Tu aimais jouer avec quand tu étais bébé.
Je m'en souviens.
- J'aimais la mordre.
- Et mon doigt avec..
Tu peux la porter si tu veux. J'ai toujours
su que je te la donnerais un jour.
Elle ne me va plus, et...
Je détesterais la perdre....
Je la garderai précieusement pour toi.
Je sais que tu le feras.
Je suis désolé si je dois partir si tôt.
Je...
J'aurais souhaité passer plus de temps avec toi.
- Eh bien, tu penses être de retour quand ?
- C'est dur à dire.
Au revoir, Isabelle.
Bye.
Merci beaucoup
Je l'emmène. Merci.
Ok...
Tu lui as dit qu'on retournait à l'hôpital ?
Comment ça s'est passé ?
Bien. Ca été facile.
J'ai dû mentir.
Tu es celui qui doit lui dire la vérité.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Nous le rattraperons.
C’est marrant, c’est exactement
la même personne qui disait ça à ton propos.
Apparemment, il a tort.
D'abord, il n'aurait jamais dû être déplacé.
- Ce n'était pas justifié....
- Si, c'était justifié.
Tu es trop gentil, Tom.
Je ne sais pas ce qui t’est arrivé.
Je l'avais, Dennis !
Tu l’as perdu !
Le coucher du soleil est dans 4 heures.
A ce point-là, nous ne pouvons pas dire avec 100% de certitude,
ce qui va arriver dans la matinée.
Et le seul gars qui pouvait
nous le dire est parti.
Voilà une attitude défaitiste.
Nous allons le retrouver.
Ouais. Je sais.
Tu n’arrêtes pas de le dire.
Hé, Shawn.
T'as quelque chose pour moi ?
Où est Daniel ?
Occupé. Il m'a envoyé.
Non, non, non. Ce n'est pas comme ça que ça marche.
Aujourd'hui si.
Tu peux me faire confiance.
Tu m’as sauvé la vie
Je te suis redevable.
Allez. Finissons-en.
Je me sens un peu mal comme ça dehors.
Merci.
Ecoute, s'il y a quelque chose
dont tu as besoin...
Tu as vendu.
- Ca va ?
- Ouais, je vais bien.
Je ne crois pas qu'on va la revoir
au tribunal de si tôt.
Non, tu as fait ce qui fallait
faire en nous appelant, Shawn.
Franchement, tu es un héros.
19 Octobre.
Plus qu'une minute.
Dites-moi juste une chose..
Sommes-nous préparé comme il le fallait ?
Le pays entier est en alerte rouge.
Tous les trafics aériens ont
été suspendus pour la journée.
La garde nationale a été déployée
aux cibles probables.
"Cibles probables."
Ca en fait beaucoup.
J'aurais aimé que T.J. rétrécisse
le nombre pour nous.
Eh bien, moi, aussi, mais on doit la garder sous
sédatif pour éviter qu'elle ne se sert de son pouvoir.
Elle a déjà changé cet endroit
en un champ de bataille, une fois.
Donc maintenant nous attendons.
Est-ce quelqu'un sent qu'il regarde
l'horloge du jugement dernier ?
Eh bien, nous y voilà
Le 19 Octobre.
On dirait que le monde est encore là.
Enfin, pour le moment.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Quoi ? Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
C'est le Groupe Nova.
Certainement, "miracle" est le mot inexact.
Mais je ne sais pas comment le décrire autrement.
Pour répéter, je suis en ce moment-même
dans le Désert Nubien au nord du Soudan,
où, durant la nuit, une grande
étendue de sable infertile
a été transformé en champs de blé.
Les scientifiques ont du mal
à expliquer la transformation,
Mais les tests confirment que le blé
est réel et comestible.
Il n'y a pas eu de nourriture dans cette partie
du monde depuis bien avant la naissance du Christ.
Ils nous ont rendu horrifié,
Et après au lieu de nous attaquer,
Ils nous ont fait un cadeau.
Nous station vient de recevoir
un message de l'organisation
Extrémiste des 4400 connus sous le nom du Groupe Nova,
qui prétende être responsable
de la transformation de ce matin.
Vous êtres les temoins d'une nouvelle ère.
Ce qui va se passer ensuite dépendra de vous.
Les 4400 peuvent être vos alliés les plus forts
comme vos redoutables ennemis.
Ne vous réjouissez pas trop. C'est une attaque.
Enfin un acte de provocation.
Ils viennent juste de montrer
qu'ils pouvaient changer le monde,
Et qu'il y a des choses
qu'on ne peut pas régler.
Allô ?
Je suis très déçu, Shawn.
Daniel.
Je réalise que tu es encore un jeune homme
et j'ai bien peur que je ne puisse pas te pardonner.
Pour répéter, je suis en ce moment-même,
Dans le Désert Nubien au nord
du Soudan, où, durant la nuit....
Ca va aller, Kyle.
Papa est...
Papa est là.
Je suis là.
Je suis là.
Rendors-toi.
Hé. Je suis tyler.
Maia.
Lily...
Nous y sommes.
Ca n'a pas beaucoup changé, hein ?
Non.
Nous étions si heureux ici.
Juste toi et moi, et le bébé.
La vie était si simple.
Tu veux aller à l'intérieur ?
Non, pas encore
Non, rest...restons encore ici un moment.
C’est si paisible.
Tu te rappelles quand tu as perdu les os ?
J'avais du mal à contrôler la voiture.
Mais tu m’as montré le chemin de l'hôpital.
Comment pouvais-tu rester si calme ?
Lily ?

We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
What? So Navarro Was really
some kind of mind reader?
I believe "telepath" is the word
you're looking for.
Just concentrate
on what you wanna ask me,
and I'll hear you.
He definitely knew
what we were thinking.
I can think of a feW
practical applications for it,
You should've come to me first,
I'd have treated you better
than they ever Will,
We're at War here,
Don't pick the losing side,
There's a synthetic substance present
in the blood of every 4400.
They call it promicin inhibitor,
NTAC's been studying the 4400
since they got back.
- They should've known.
- They do know.
I was ordered to work on a drug
to suppress the production of promicin.
Once I synthesized the inhibitor,
we gave it to every 4400.
But if it comes down to a choice
between the safety
of the American people
and the welfare of the 4400, Tom,
that's no choice at all.
Because if you're holding on to
any hope of keeping this covered up,
you're gonna have to start by putting
me in the ground right here, right now.
Every male in this building
has got a gallon of adrenaline
coursing through his veins right noW,
and most of them are armed,
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified government facility,
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.
I wasn't pregnant
when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.
You've seen What she's capable of,
What she can do
When she feels threatened,
You knoW Isabelle has connections
between the right
and left hemispheres of her brain
that have never been seen before,
You are the steWards of the future,
Your daughter is the Rosetta stone
for understanding
what happened to the 4400.
Isabelle?
Isabelle!.
Hello, Shawn. I'm lsabelle.
The world has changed.
Everything is different now.
The Promicin lnhibitor Program
was an international effort.
Its goal was to prevent
the coming of a world
dominated by a tiny fraction
of the population.
In short, we were doing
everything we could
to prevent the 4400 from developing
extra-human capabilities.
We believe
that without the inhibitor program,
these abilities Would shoW up
in virtually every one of the 4400,
I don't think I need to explain
to this committee
Why that Would be something less
than the best-case scenario,
Overnight, normal human beings
like you and I,
and all the institutions
We've come to rely on
Would be obsolete,
The program Wasn't perfect,
People got sick, Some died,
That Was not our intent,
But noW it's gone,
And the future that We Were trying
to prevent is here,
and We are not ready,
I believe it comes doWn
to a question of poWer,
Who is going to hold it?
Us or them?
Because, believe me, it's going
to come down to us against them.
Shawn, you're not making any sense.
Just tell me what's wrong with lsabelle.
I told you, I can't explain.
Is she sick? Is she hurt?
You gotta see for yourself.
Dad.
Who the hell is this?
Where's lsabelle?
I am your daughter. I'm lsabelle.
- I don't get it.
- It's not a joke.
Something happened. I changed.
I don't know how.
She just walked in here.
She knew my name. She seems
to know about you and Lily--
Stop.
I don't know what game
you're playing here, and I don't care.
Richard. Richard...
Lily.
Lily.
Lily?
Is lsabelle with you?
Lily? Lil--
Lily, are you all right?
Oh, Richard. I must've fainted.
Is lsabelle with you?
Who are you? Where's my wife?
Richard, what are you talking about?
I'm Lily, your wife.
Why are you looking at me like--?
- Oh, my God.
- Ma'am, I don't know who you are.
Oh, my God.
No!.
Your blood pressure is elevated.
But I suppose that's to be expected.
Heart, lungs, reflexes,
all within the normal range.
Doctor, you call this normal?
Richard, I wanna see lsabelle.
Where is my daughter?
She's right outside.
I'll bring her in in a minute.
I realize how alarming this must be.
But at least you can take
some solace in the fact
that your wife is a perfectly healthy
older woman.
If I had to guess,
I'd say she's about 75.
I'm 29, and I don't understand.
Please, help me understand.
How could this happen?
Maybe it's a reaction to being taken off
the promicin inhibitor.
But truthfully, I don't know.
There is a condition called progeria.
It's associated with rapid aging.
So this kind of thing
has happened before?
Mr. Tyler, when your wife
fainted this morning,
she was a young woman.
When she woke up
less than a minute later,
she was 50 years older.
I can guarantee you, this is a first.
Excuse me.
- Are you okay, Dr. Burkhoff?
- I'm fine. Not enough sleep, that's all.
Research.
Well, what do we do now?
Is there any way to reverse this?
I wish I knew.
I need to do some thinking.
Are you my mother?
Isabelle?
Every day, the 4400 are changing
and getting stronger.
Instead of mobilizing
to meet this challenge,
we're wringing our hands and trying
to determine who knew what when.
I will save this committee the trouble
and expense of a long investigation.
The inhibitor program was my idea.
I was proud to lead it.
The men on this board
were simply following my orders.
If there's blame to be assigned,
it's mine.
Mine alone.
Yeah, I know Kyle
doesn't wanna see me.
Is there some way
we can force him to?
I'm his father.
I wanna know how he's doing.
Look, I realize you're trying,
but it'll be months before he goes
to trial, I'm not gonna wait that long.
Do you really think people
are gonna let Ryland position himself
as some kind of patriotic martyr?
The man headed a conspiracy
that caused 28 deaths.
He says it was accidental.
A significant percentage
of this country believes him.
Try overwhelming.
You guys listen to talk radio lately?
I mean, the calls are, like,
90 percent in his favor.
You can buy a "Free Dennis Ryland"
T-shirt within a block of here.
Maybe they should put him up
for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Just tell him I need to see him.
We don't have to talk about the case.
I just have to see my son.
Just ask him one more time, okay?
And tell him we love him.
Give him some time, Thomas.
Kyle needs to live with his choice
for a while.
We're back.
Tom, break's over.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to call the proceedings to order.
Everyone, just take your seats
so we can get started.
Members of the press,
I was including you
in that "ladies and gentlemen"
designation, thank you.
Mr. Ryland, I'd like to pick up
the questioning where we left off.
You insist that you alone
gave the go-ahead
for the Promicin lnhibitor Program,
is that right, sir?
Yes, sir.
It was my program all the way.
So this committee is to understand
that your department
was able to plan and implement
an international conspiracy
without some
Cabinet-level approval?
That's correct.
I was given a broad mandate
in my duties as head of NTAC.
I felt that the project fell
within that mandate.
So there was no need
to seek outside approval--
- Excuse us, everybody.
- Did you hear that?
Well, yeah, the microphones
went haywire.
No, not that. Something else.
Just set that approval issue to the side
for the moment.
Did you ever discuss the project
with anyone outside of NTAC?
I mean, someone, somewhere,
must have taken an interest
in what your people
were doing over there.
- Listen to me.
- What? What's wrong?
- A simple question, Mr. Ryland.
- What do you mean, "What's wrong"?
Surely, it can't be that difficult
to answer.
If I could have your attention
up here, Mr. Ryland.
You need to relax, Miles.
Security!. Stop that man!
Get some protection on Ryland.
Stay here. I'll be right back.
We need an ambulance!
Someone call an ambulance!
Stand back, please. Back. Back.
Hey!
Stop! T.J.!
Someone get these photographers
out of here.
You stay with him.
I don't understand what I did.
Would somebody please tell me
what I just did?
Hang on, Dennis.
The ambulance is coming.
Yeah, it was her.
The blood we picked up at the scene
matches the DNA in our records.
That was T.J. Kim running
from the courthouse.
When she hit this place,
T.J. drove every man in the building
into a homicidal rage.
Now it sounds like
she just zapped one guy.
She's learning to control
what she can do. They all are.
Ever since we took them off
the inhibitor,
they're either developing
new abilities,
or they're refining the ones
that they've got.
So they are getting more dangerous.
I guess Ryland was right.
I'll be sure to mention that
to my daughter.
Okay, save the point-counterpoint.
At the moment,
we've been tasked with two jobs.
We track down T.J. Kim.
What's the second job?
We are to protect Ryland's
co-conspirators
from any further reprisals.
So we arrest them,
and now we're their bodyguards?
Well, the entire country just saw
a 4400 turn a government hearing
into her own personal slasher film.
If T.J. gets to Ryland again, or any
of them, before we can bring her in,
people are gonna start to wonder
if the United States government
is capable of protecting its citizens.
And that's the beginning of chaos.
Back to work, please.
Tom.
In case you're wondering,
Dennis is still in surgery.
They say that it is touch-and-go.
It's okay. Give me your hands.
Try and relax.
Relax.
Is it better?
Much better.
For now.
When this thing first came on,
it was bad,
but at least she was healthy.
Now she's had diabetes,
emphysema.
Seems like every day,
there's something new.
I'll come help her every day.
Listen, we got everyone
working on this.
We're gonna figure it out.
- Is my mother okay?
- Yeah.
She had a little problem.
Shawn fixed it.
It's all in the wrists.
Can I see her?
Please?
Mom?
Isabelle.
- Come here.
- Is there anything I can do?
I'm fine. Really. Sit down.
You were such a beautiful baby.
I used to hold you all day long.
I knew exactly what you were feeling,
what you wanted.
We were so close.
I'm sorry for growing up so fast.
I didn't mean to.
I didn't want to.
Neither did l.
Crazy thing is, I keep thinking
about Patty, Ryland's wife.
I feel like I should call her
or something, help her through this.
Maybe you should. You and Ryland
were friends for a long time.
It's okay to be conflicted.
Yeah, well, Ryland's little experiment
almost got you killed. Shawn too.
The guy knew that Kyle was stalking
Jordan Collier and he did nothing.
I'd say that trumps friendship.
You have so much on your mind.
Kyle, Ryland, the 4400s.
I need to get you away from here,
away from your problems.
Yeah, well, it sounds nice.
But I can't go anywhere.
I'm starting investigation
in the morning.
What if I told you
I could take you away
between now and then?
My ability.
Since I'm off the inhibitor,
I think I can control it now.
What, you mean you wanna--?
You wanna take me into another
dream world? Alternate real--?
- I don't even know what to call it.
- Call it a vacation.
A week. A year. As long as we want.
All that in the space
of a few moments.
Should we try it?
What, right here? Now?
- What do we do?
- We're already doing it.
There's no one on the beach.
It's all ours, Thomas, so is the hotel.
We can stay here
for as long as we like.
There is no jet lag.
That sounds perfect.
It is perfect too.
The door's open. Come in.
What? What is it?
- You're naked.
- I'm more comfortable this way.
Haven't really gotten used
to them. Clothes.
I have a bathrobe.
Is this better?
Almost.
Just--
Never met anybody
that read the encyclopedia
- from cover to cover before.
- Oh, I'm not finished.
I just delivered those
to you yesterday.
Okay, you're a fast reader.
That's really cool.
Listen, they're looking for you
down in the labs.
You're like an hour late.
They sent you to get me?
- Aren't you in charge?
- Well, yeah, more or less.
You know, I go where I'm needed.
They were scared of me,
weren't they?
- Pretty much.
- That's all right.
I think my parents are frightened of me.
I don't think your mom and dad
are scared of you.
I think they're just confused.
I don't blame them.
It's mostly how I feel too.
I don't understand
what happened to me.
I don't understand
what happened to my mother.
And I'm trying to read and learn things,
but mostly, I just--
I still feel lost.
See, now you sound like
a real 4400.
But I'm not a 4400.
Not like my mother and father,
or you.
Looks like I'm gonna live.
Sorry to disappoint you, Tom.
Why'd you ask to see me, Dennis?
I hear that you and Skouris
are in charge of the investigation.
Yeah. We know who did it.
We'll find her.
T.J. Kim attacked this building
six weeks ago.
No one's tracked her down yet?
We got a little sidetracked
cleaning up your mess, Dennis.
Did you ever think
that maybe she has help?
Other 4400s who feel the same way
about the government she does?
When we catch her, we'll ask.
Will you?
I wanna make sure you're gonna take
this thing as far as it goes, Tom.
The same way you did
when you came after me.
And I want my people protected.
They were acting under my orders.
They're under guard.
So was the courthouse
when Kim attacked.
I'd feel better if you brought them in.
We offered sanctuary
to every single conspirator.
There were no takers.
I guess no one Wanted to cooperate
With the organization
that Was Working to put you in prison,
We had to fight
just to get them to let us
post agents outside their houses,
Crocket, are you ready to go
for a walk, boy?
Come on, Crocket. Let's go.
They wanted no part of us.
They all seemed confident
that T.J. Kim was acting alone.
Crock?
What's wrong? It's me.
This just arrived 1 5 minutes ago.
This is a message
from the Nova Group,
We are the defensive Wing
of the 4400,
Today, the World has seen
What happens to those
Who try to harm us,
A second demonstration
of our capabilities
is planned for October 1 9th,
A neW era daWns,
Defensive wing, huh?
What happens
when they decide to play offense?
- I guess we find out in five days.
- They didn't say what they want.
No demands.
No room for compromise.
We don't even know how many 4400s
are in this Nova Group.
We couldn't handle one when she
walked in here and attacked the place.
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there, all with abilities?
They got someone who can kill you
by lowering your body temperature.
Don't forget the beast master.
What? That dog got pissed off
pretty quick.
I've been all over the files,
and none of these abilities
have been registered with us.
They're off the inhibitor now.
We can't even pretend
to have a comprehensive list
of what these people can do.
Is anyone else feeling
a little overmatched here?
You two remember Gary Navarro?
Hey, Gary. Been a while.
You're right, Baldwin.
I do think you two sold me out.
It really bothered me for a while,
but now I understand
it's just standard operating procedure.
Well, I guess that mind-reading thing's
working pretty well, huh?
Better than ever, actually.
Gary's telepathic abilities
have been very useful
to the National Security Agency.
They've agreed to let us borrow him
while we investigate the Nova Group.
You're clear on what we're doing?
You want to use a 4400
to track down other 4400s.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Not at all.
It won't be my first time.
So can we get started?
Never heard of the Nova Group.
Not until this morning, anyway.
Now I gotta go on television
in an hour
and explain that the Center
had nothing to do with this.
Shawn.
I know there's a lot of history
between NTAC and this place.
But I trust you realize
how serious this is.
Believe me, if I knew anything,
I would tell you.
Well, do you mind if the three of us
walk around the place,
- talk to people?
- You and your pet mind reader?
No, I can't let you do that.
These people
haven't done anything wrong.
I won't let you invade their privacy.
And I actually can't believe
that you brought this guy here again.
How much do they pay you
to spy on your own kind?
Are you getting a clear signal?
See anything you like up there?
As far as I can tell,
he's not hiding anything.
I have a lot of work to do.
If I hear anything, I'll give you a call.
For now, that's the best I can do.
Sorry about my nephew.
- Why?
- He was kind of rude back there.
I get that kind of stuff a lot.
I don't take it personally.
You mind if I ask you--?
You've sort of implied
that you've pursued 4400s in the past.
What exactly do you do
for the NSA?
- Overseas stuff, mostly.
- But like what? Give me an example.
They fly me someplace.
I approach the subject,
find out what he's thinking.
And I tell the people I work for,
who then fly me home
where I live comfortably.
What happens to the subject?
I don't ask.
That's good.
The neural pathway comparisons
are particularly illuminating.
Make sure you understand them
before you move on.
Dr. Burkhoff,
I don't understand any of this.
A bunch of her neurons
don't work anymore.
Every time one of hers turns off,
one of mine turns on.
Exactly.
And what's true for neurons
is true for muscle fibers,
synaptic pathways.
There is a one-to-one
correspondence
between the amount you lost
and the amount you gained.
So all this is just a way
of saying I'm doing this to her?
The correlation is too precise
to be random.
Your rapid aging
has caused her rapid aging.
How do we stop it?
Put me back the way I was?
- I'm afraid I can't.
- So, what do we do about it?
There is a possibility
that if the aging agent were eliminated,
that Lily might be restored
to her normal self.
- The aging agent?
- He means me.
I'm killing you.
The only way for you to live
is for me to die. Isn't that right?
Don't answer that, Dr. Burkhoff.
Thank you for your time,
but we're done here.
Where are you going?
We're not discussing this.
Not now.
Not ever.
- It's true, isn't it?
- I think so.
But it's only a theory.
Guys, I went over this six weeks ago
with the men in black.
Humor us.
I went on two dates with T.J. Kim.
Then I cut it off.
- Girl had a lot of baggage.
- How long ago was that?
About two months ago.
If I'd known there would be
government agents
showing up every other day
to ask me about her,
I would've taken notes.
Hey, so listen.
All this stuff about October 1 9th,
you guys think it's serious?
I mean, like,
should I be getting out of town?
I don't think that's the answer.
As far as we know,
you're as safe here as anywhere else.
That kid was lying. Or at least
he wasn't telling you everything.
The whole time
you were talking to him,
he was thinking about an address.
331 Reynolds Avenue.
Looks like it's clear. Nobody's home.
Nobody's been home for a while,
I'd say.
Look at this.
It's the government report
on the return of the 4400.
I tried to read this once.
Kind of dry.
It looks like someone made it
right through to the end.
"Wesley Hauser."
- "Wesley Hauser. Wesley Hauser."
- Who the hell is Wesley Hauser?
Hauser was a Marine.
Did two tours of duty in Vietnam.
He led protests against the war
after he got home in '72.
Disappeared in '75.
Once he got out of quarantine,
he never checked back in.
Guy's been living off the grid
for almost two years.
Which means he never went
on the inhibitor.
So who knows
what he's capable of by now.
He was disillusioned with the
government before he disappeared.
I wouldn't say we've done much
to win him over since he's been back.
When he was in quarantine,
he was housed in barracks three,
same building as T.J. Kim.
An agitator. An organizer. A radical.
Sounds like we have our
second member of the Nova Group.
Baldwin.
You're kidding me.
All right. All right. I know.
Put him through.
- He says he's Wesley Hauser.
- No way.
Yeah, hello?
HoW'd you like my apartment?
Well, to be honest, it felt a little empty
without you there.
I'm on a tight schedule,
A lot to do before next Week,
Sounds like you have interesting plans.
Why don't we get together someplace,
- talk them over?
- No more talking,
There's nothing to say,
Your time is ending,
Ours begins October 19th,
Come on. Let me go.
Why'd you run
when we asked you about Hauser?
You two used to eat together
in quarantine.
- We've got it on camera.
- So...?
The guy had a lot
of good war stories.
- Doesn't make us best friends.
- So why did you run?
Because when I see NTAC agents,
I run the other way.
You people almost killed us all.
Can you blame me?
Turn around. Turn around.
- Are we done here?
- Get out of here.
I mean, call me sensitive,
but I felt like saying to him,
"We exposed the inhibitor.
We saved your life."
You guys just don't really get it,
do you?
It's not just that guy.
Every 4400 we've talked to today,
they're scared of you.
Or they don't trust you.
Or they hate you.
I'm sorry, but the days
when you could expect
friendly conversation
from these people, they're gone.
You're the bad guys now.
Get used to it.
Now, I'm just warning you,
motherhood's no cakewalk.
Since when are you an expert?
I'm only saying she landed on twins.
Kind of a big responsibility.
Especially when she's trying to get by
on a teacher's salary.
- What are you gonna name them?
- I don't really want to play anymore.
- Is that okay?
- Oh, what's wrong, sweetheart?
Nothing,
except I know Marco's gonna win,
I'm gonna come second, and you're
gonna end up alone with no money.
Don't be jealous.
He is smarter than you,
but Mom likes you better.
So who's smarter than me?
Who knows?
I'm not even sure
she knows exactly.
In some ways she was better off
on the promicin inhibitor.
At least she wasn't overwhelmed
back then.
All she wants to do is record
what she sees in those notebooks.
It's like some kind of compulsion.
Well, think about it for a minute.
Every morning she wakes up
and knows pretty much what's coming.
She's already lived the whole day
once in her head.
By the time
something actually does happen,
it's like a rerun.
- I hate watching reruns.
- Yeah, try living one.
Hey, what about Kevin Burkhoff?
Maybe he can figure out a way
for Maia to control her visions.
- He's brilliant.
- I don't say this about many people,
but he is smarter than me.
I know you.
- Of course you do. It's Diana Skouris.
- You work at NTAC.
I'm not here on business, though.
I'm here about my daughter, Maia.
The precog. What about her?
She's still 1 0, right?
She's not 65 now, is she?
Interesting guess.
- Kind of wide of the mark, though.
- Good.
Might as well come on in.
Thank you.
- Oh, sorry about the clutter.
- That's okay.
I fired the maid last week.
She was always cleaning.
Excuse me.
So your daughter,
what's troubling her?
I'll let you do it.
I caused all this, right?
And getting rid of me is the only way
to save my mother.
No.
That's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?
No, it wasn't.
I don't want her to die either.
So I'll let you do it.
I'll even shut my eyes.
Isabelle, I would never hurt you.
Why?
I don't understand.
It's the only way to save her.
We don't know that.
And I won't make a choice
between the two of you.
Won't or can't?
Sorry. I don't mean
to invade anyone's space.
Oh, that's okay. It's not my desk.
But it looks like you'll be here
for a while now, huh?
Assuming this place is still standing
on October 20th, yeah.
Maybe we should talk to Jarvis.
Get you a room of your very own.
That's fine with me.
To tell you the truth,
I could use a little bit of a buffer zone.
This problem you're having
with your daughter's precog ability.
I keep wanting to give you
my opinion.
But I don't want to intrude.
So you are listening to my thoughts.
You and Baldwin. I can't help it.
I try to tune you guys out,
but every now and then
something leaks through.
I'll try to keep that in mind.
You said you had an opinion
about Maia. What is it?
When I first developed
this thing of mine,
I was a basket case. You saw me.
I truly thought I was going insane.
So I fought against it.
And that just made it worse.
I had to give in to it,
let it take control of me.
And then slowly,
I learned how to take control of it.
Listen, your kid stops fighting,
and eventually it'll become like seeing,
or hearing, or any other sense.
She won't even think about it.
It's just a part of who she is.
That's how it worked for me,
anyway.
Thank you.
Diana, we just got a call
from Seattle police.
Someone down there read our APB.
They know exactly where Hauser is.
You guys are lucky, actually.
In another day or two,
we would've buried him
in the potter's field.
- Buried who?
- Him.
I always read the APB memos
when they circulate
in the police department.
Kind of a hobby.
Gets boring in here.
Anyway, there was a description
of a regimental tattoo
on the memo for Hauser.
82nd Airborne.
"Death From Above."
I remember it from a John Doe
they brought in here three weeks ago.
This guy drowned in the harbor.
Well, a lot of veterans
have that tattoo.
Do a lot of veterans look exactly
like the mug shot you circulated?
Don't believe me?
Take a look for yourselves.
Say hello to Wesley Hauser.
Hauser died two and a half weeks
before Ryland was attacked.
Obviously, that wasn't him
on the phone the other day.
And that copy of the 4400 report
with all his notes over it?
For all we know,
that could've been a plant.
Somebody wanted us distracted.
They deliberately put us on the trail
of some phantom member
of the Nova Group.
How did we first find out
about Hauser?
T.J.'s old boyfriend
gave us the address.
No, he was thinking it.
At least according to Gary he was.
Gary Navarro put us
on to Wesley Hauser.
Get in.
You lied to me, Daniel.
You never said anything
about killing people.
No, we were protecting you, Shawn.
If we tell you in advance,
you're culpable.
- What is she doing here?
- She's dying. She needs your help.
I told you, I don't want anything more
to do with you.
The Nova Group
was supposed to protect us.
That's why I gave you money,
Daniel.
That's why I gave you money.
Not to start a terrorist organization!
We'll talk about your concerns later.
She's got a stomach wound
and it's infected.
She needs you right now
or she's not gonna make it.
Shawn, she's a 4400.
And if we don't help each other,
what hope do we have?
Give me your hand.
What are you doing here?
You're awake. Good.
It's important
that you know it was me.
I'm the guy who killed you.
Med post, do you have a 20
on Gary Navarro?
- Yeah, he just walked by. Why?
- Get him,
Hey. Stop!
Go. I'll check on Ryland.
He's seizing. He's bradying down.
I need a crash cart and Ativan.
Find Dr. Danoff. Now!
Stay right there, Gary.
Isabelle.
Isabelle. Oh, God!
Somebody call an ambulance!
What's everybody
standing around for?
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- They're on their way.
- Somebody call an ambulance.
- Dad.
What am l?
It's miraculous, ShaWn,
When I watch you heal someone,
well, it makes me wonder
why they hate us so much.
They hate us
because you're killing them, Daniel.
They're afraid of us.
I can't blame them.
You make it sound like we acted out
of some sort of blood lust.
These were precise,
tactical strikes, Shawn.
And you and every other 4400
were ultimately much safer
because of them.
You killed people.
That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.
I gave you money to start
a defensive arm for the Center,
in case the government
ever came after us again.
It was a precaution.
And all we've done
is taken precautionary measures.
Shawn, do you think that because
their inhibitor program was exposed,
that the government's just gonna
leave us in peace?
They know we've gotten stronger,
which threatens their hold on power,
which increases their need
to eliminate us.
So we strike first?
Is that it?
Is that what happens on the 1 9th?
Look, Shawn.
You do great work
at that center of yours.
You just focus on that.
I don't wanna distract you.
Knowledge can be a burden.
And thanks for helping T.J. out.
You're a hero to your own people.
Don't forget that.
Yeah.
It did not work, you know.
Ryland was OD'ing,
but the doctors pulled him out of it.
He'll be awake
within a couple of hours.
Well, I'm sure
you're as disappointed as I am.
Don't worry, we'll get him.
Let's talk about Wesley Hauser.
You first met him in quarantine.
I liked Wes.
He was ten kinds of crazy,
but his heart was in the right place.
I guess he was bipolar or something,
but he never took medication.
After quarantine,
he lived on the streets.
I used to visit him
down at the docks.
You know, give him food,
a little money.
So when did you decide to kill him?
Wes, he didn't need
my help with that.
He drank about three bottles
of Mad Dog a day.
One morning, about a month ago,
I went down to see him,
and I found him by the dumpster,
dead.
And somewhere in the middle
of your grieving process,
you figured
he'd make a handy decoy.
No, Hauser wouldn't have minded it.
I mean, he hated people like you
going back to his Marine Corps days.
So when I found him,
I said a word or two over his body.
And I pushed him into Elliot Bay.
So how long you been working
with this Nova Group?
Did someone approach you?
Was the whole thing your idea?
Tell me.
You and this girlfriend of yours.
Is it like a role-playing thing
you get up to,
or is she actually taking you
into these...?
I don't know. What do you call it?
Fantasy worlds?
Oh, and this guy, Marco.
Does he know that you're too
embarrassed to tell your partner
that you two have been dating?
Done showing off?
Why don't you tell us what's
gonna happen on October 1 9th?
I guess you're gonna have
to find yourself another telepath.
Good luck with that.
- So you got nothing out of him?
- He told us about Hauser.
But as far as the Nova goes,
it's gonna take time to break him down.
- How much time?
- He's a telepath.
- He knows what we're thinking.
- Longer than usual.
Okay, so it's not easy.
But Gary Navarro
has a Level 7 security clearance.
We must assume he's been using it
to funnel national secrets
to the Nova Group.
We need to know what he knows.
Now.
He'll talk.
Gary's been inside our heads
for a year.
I think I know
how to get inside of his.
- Careful with this, please.
- Matthew.
I didn't expect to see you back
for a couple weeks.
Nova Group provides
my calendar for me.
Wiped it clean, actually.
It's difficult to lobby
on behalf of the 4400
when some of them are boasting
about their body count.
I suppose.
How's Lily?
Any improvement since I left?
- If anything, she's getting worse.
- Sorry to hear that.
Isabelle?
She tried to kill herself
this morning.
She jumped off the roof.
A few minutes later, she was walking
around like nothing happened.
I gotta tell you, Matthew.
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm really glad you're back.
Hello, lsabelle.
Hello. Who are you?
My name is Matthew Ross.
I work closely with Shawn.
I'm an adviser to the 4400.
May I come in?
I understand
there was an incident this morning.
You attempted to harm yourself.
I see.
You had no right to do that!
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?
- No.
- Well, I do.
I know everything about you.
I know why you're here,
and I know
what you're supposed to do.
Sit.
And I'll tell you a story.
You'll like it.
It's about your past
and it's about your future.
I know you went
to a lot of trouble to get this.
- Thank you.
- But...?
I'm not sure
I wanna send Maia to a school
that only teaches 4400s.
It sounds like a great way to get her to
withdraw even further from the world.
Just pretend it's got nothing to do
with the 4400 for a second.
It's a good school.
You know, topnotch faculty.
The facilities are great.
And it's all free.
The 4400 Center picks up
the whole tab.
They even have a class
on how to manage your abilities.
Just give me some time
to think about it, okay? It's a big step.
I was kind of hoping
Dr. Burkhoff would have,
I don't know,
a magic pill or something.
What's he working on?
Anything interesting?
You know that promicin serum
that he invented that saved everybody?
Well, I saw a syringe at his place,
and it looked like there was some in it.
Well, he's a researcher, right?
He's probably injecting into, what?
Mice? Guinea pigs?
The only animals I saw at his place
were a couple of cockroaches.
You don't think he's injecting it
into himself, do you?
That's ridiculous,
I am not injecting myself
with the promicin serum.
Good. I'm glad to hear it.
I'm injecting myself
with a modified version
of the promicin serum.
Dr. Burkhoff, I have to ask you this:
Have you stopped taking
your medication?
Of course not.
I'm as sane as you are.
Once the course of treatment
is finished,
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin.
And then I will be the first
non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.
The first of many.
You're talking about the next step
in human evolution.
Do you think
the world's ready for that?
The world is never ready for change.
You have to force it on them.
Isn't that why the 4400
were brought back?
Isn't that why the future
woke me up?
You shouldn't be doing research
of this magnitude
in, excuse me, but-- In a dump.
These are hardly sterile
working conditions.
You could help me with that.
You have a scientific background,
right?
I have graduate degrees
in microbiology and epidemiology.
Good. That'll be handy.
I need someone
to monitor my progress
as the changes continue.
Changes?
I think it's an exciting first step,
don't you?
I was thinking, next time,
we could make a world
where Kyle never shot Jordan Collier,
never went to prison,
the inhibitor scandal
never happened.
Sounds nice.
Although I have to tell you,
at the moment,
I'm not really feeling a need
to be transported
to some kind of fantasy world.
As long as this water stays hot,
things are A-okay with me
right here and now.
Maybe tomorrow we can try it again.
I'll take a rain check.
I'm going to a seminar
at the 4400 Center tomorrow.
It's about what
we can expect physically
now that we're off the inhibitor.
Is everything okay? You're not
having any problems, are you?
No, I feel fine. I feel great, actually.
Well, then I don't get it.
Why do you need to go?
I don't. I wanna go. I'm curious.
But why? You never wanted
to go to the Center before.
Why start now?
I never felt the need
to be around other 4400s before.
Now you do?
It's just a seminar, Thomas.
Yeah, okay.
I get it.
Do you recognize those names?
They're 4400s.
All of them foreign nationals.
Alesandro Ortiz from Venezuela.
Ismael Namir from Libya.
Chitra Singh from lndonesia.
They've all gone missing
in the past year.
That's one year.
That's about as long as you've worked
for the NSA, isn't it, Gary?
We checked your travel records.
You left Venezuela two days
before Ortiz disappeared.
Same thing in Libya, lndonesia.
Everyone on that list.
You were there. They went away.
What exactly did you do
for the NSA, Gary?
There's an arms race going on,
isn't there?
Only now it's with 4400s.
These people, I bet their abilities
make the wrong people very nervous.
And the NSA couldn't stand by
while foreign and potentially
hostile governments developed what?
Human weapons
of mass destruction?
Is this list complete, huh?
Because I'm just wondering
how many 4400s you did kill.
- I did not kill anyone.
- Oh, no, no, no.
You got the right people
in the right ZlP code
because you were living back home.
What did you say? Oh, yeah.
"Very comfortably
when the actual dirty work was done."
And that's why you went across
to the Nova Group, isn't it, Gary?
Because you just couldn't live
with yourself.
The NSA told me
that I was helping my country.
They didn't fill in the blanks.
I had to do that myself.
You felt used.
They made you a weapon
against your own people.
So when did you figure it out?
What's up? Who are these guys?
This is Agent Wood
and Dr. Boll of the NSA.
They've been brought in
to help expedite the interrogation.
First of all, no more sitting.
What's going on here?
- Brought in by whom?
- Gary Navarro tried to kill me.
I made a phone call.
You should be in jail right now,
Dennis.
- I still have a few friends, Tom.
- I had him talking.
- I was making progress.
- Not fast enough.
The members of Gary's cell
know he's been taken.
They're already changing
their plans.
If it takes too long to break him,
the information he gives us is stale.
- October 1 9th is three days away.
- Yeah.
I know you find this
hard to believe, Tom,
but we are on the same side.
We have the same goal.
Those agents are tools.
Use them.
You're sitting in my spot.
Sorry.
It's okay.
There's room for two people to sit.
You've got Stalin, Pol Pot
and the Marquis de Sade?
Did you finish all the fun books?
Well, I'm interested
in learning more about evil.
Everybody's scared of me.
So I thought, what if they're right?
- What if I'm bad?
- Why would you think that?
Sometimes, I think
I feel it inside of me,
Iike, I could be capable of anything.
Everyone's capable of anything.
- Believe me, I know.
- How?
- Have you done bad things?
- Yeah, of course I have.
Will you tell me about them?
Okay.
- I slept with my brother's girlfriend.
- How bad is that?
Some people would call that
a major betrayal.
A lot of hurt feelings.
- This man did much worse than that.
- Well, I'm not a dictator.
But I've done the big kind of bad too.
I can't say much about it,
but I gave some money
to some people.
They used it for something
really, really wrong.
And I don't think
that they're finished.
- Well, can you stop them?
- I could turn them in.
The thing is, so far, they've
only gone after bad people.
- People that tried to kill me.
- Tried to kill all of us.
So if they've only gone
after bad people,
- then doesn't that make them good?
- Maybe.
I don't know.
We're relating now, aren't we?
I read about this.
Yeah, we are.
How was it for you?
I liked it.
We talked.
It helped me understand
good and evil.
According to you, you get to pick.
It's a choice.
I have it right, don't l?
Yeah, you do.
I can't open my hand.
I woke up from a nap,
and it was all bunched up like this.
Arthritis, I can handle.
Feels good.
You're like a human heating pad.
I like that.
Human heating pad.
I'll take it as a compliment.
Seriously, you better?
Yeah.
I've been trading e-mails
with somebody
down at the Mayo Clinic.
He says we should go to Sweden
and try this experimental treatment.
Here.
What's this?
Open it.
Can you believe that the Air Force
lets you do that now?
You give them some money,
and they let you ride along in an F-1 6.
It says here
I get to take the controls.
I talked to the guy
who was in charge of the program
and I told him about
your background as a pilot,
and he said he would let you drive
for 30 seconds.
Lily, I was a pilot in 1 950.
That's why it's only 30 seconds.
Happy birthday, Richard.
Thanks, but it's not my birthday
for another six weeks.
Richard, I'm not going to be here
in six weeks.
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.
You and I have both known
for a while.
Richard, I'm dying.
Lily,
I know how hard this is on you,
but you can't give up.
Shawn said he's willing to stay
here with you all day if he has to.
- He'll keep you healthy.
- He can't.
Not anymore.
Are all these people 4400s?
Some are.
Some just wish they were.
Why would they want that?
Good morning.
Welcome to the Center.
Are you a 4400?
No, sweetie. Are you?
Well, it is an honor to meet you.
- Are you here to take our seminar?
- No. We're here to look at the school.
We have an appointment
with Ms. Tobey.
I'll get her right away.
In the meantime, would you sign in
and register your ability?
We're creating a database.
You sure you wanna do this?
I wanna meet kids like me.
My name is Alana Mareva.
I have to admit,
I was pretty hesitant
about coming here today.
I was lucky. My life was pretty much
intact when I was returned.
I never thought much
about being a 4400.
But when we all got sick,
and seeing everyone together
in quarantine,
it made me feel like
I had been denying a part of myself.
So here I am.
And I'm glad I came.
Anything you wanna tell me?
Gary.
Let's end this.
I'll let you sit down.
Who contacted you first?
Just give me a name.
Oh, man.
So how about it?
October 1 9th is two days away.
Now, you got something
to tell me or not?
Suit yourself.
One of our members
has been compromised.
I have to assume
he's gonna give up my name.
What, so you call me?
For all I know,
NTAC is monitoring this line.
Well, we're gonna have
to go underground.
It's gonna cost money.
You think I'm just gonna write you
a check?
You can arrange it
hoWever you Want,
I need it tomorrow.
I will see you at the usual spot,
at the usual time.
We are in a war,
and we all have to do our part.
Talk to me, Gary.
What do you got to say, man?
Talk to me! Talk to me.
I need names.
Give me a name!
- Talk to me, Gary.
- Daniel Armand.
Daniel Armand.
Daniel Armand.
Okay. That's a start.
- Who else?
- That's it.
He was my only contact.
I never met anyone else in the group.
He kept us all separate.
I'm sorry. I'm just having
a hard time believing that's true.
His pulse is tachy at 21 0.
Systolic's up to 240.
- We need to lay off.
- We've only got one name.
Can't put him under again.
Not for a few hours.
We haven't got a few hours.
Don't worry. He's my responsibility.
No. No.
No, he's not. He's ours.
And he's done for the day.
Okay, so he's back.
It's not like we weren't expecting this.
No. Relax.
He won't get anywhere
near lsabelle.
We'll find him, and we'll deal with it.
You made a mistake.
- You got the wrong person.
- I have to go. I don't think I do.
Those things you told me,
those things you said I'm going to do.
That's not me. I have a choice.
And I don't know who you are,
and I don't know how you think
you know so much about me,
- but you're wrong.
- lsabelle,
I understand
why you're having trouble adjusting.
Growing up is hard,
but don't be angry at the messenger.
It's not my plan.
I'm just here to help facilitate,
to help you reach your full potential.
Think of me as a favorite uncle.
No. No, I don't have any uncles.
I don't have any uncles,
and I won't be a part of any plan.
That's fair enough.
You can always opt out.
You can even try saving
your mother if you like.
How?
- What is that?
- Open it.
There aren't a lot of things
that'll hurt you, lsabelle.
But that right there, that'll do the job.
If you can't accept the fact
that your life
is vastly more important
than your mother's,
just give yourself that shot.
You'll be dead in minutes.
And Lily? Who knows?
Maybe she'll wake up
and be a young woman again.
- Will it really save her?
- I don't know. It's a gamble.
But if you can't live
with who you are, then don't.
Sorry about that.
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew I had a clean cup
somewhere.
Now, where are the filters?
- It's okay. I don't need coffee.
- I swear I just saw them.
Do you mind
if I just use paper towels?
- Kevin, if I do this...
- If you do it?
You're already doing it.
You're here, right?
If I monitor you
throughout this experiment,
I need you to know one thing.
If it gets to a point
where your life is in danger,
I am cutting this off.
I will not stand by
and watch you die.
Well, I would hope not,
because I'm too valuable.
I think this is gonna be fun.
I haven't really worked with anyone
for quite some time.
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Me too.
So...
Wanna draw some blood?
Nina.
We were just downstairs. The guard
on duty said Wood signed Gary out.
Gary was transferred
to an NSA-run facility.
But he's a 4400.
He's our jurisdiction.
And someone at the Pentagon
signed an order overriding us.
Apparently,
they feel we lack experience
in high-pressure interrogation.
And who do you think put
that little bug in their ear?
I don't know if it was Ryland or not.
But we had our shot at Navarro.
Now, tomorrow is October 1 9th.
We are a day away
from an announced terrorist attack.
The NSA thinks
they can get him to talk.
- So where are they taking him?
- They didn't share that information.
This is so wrong.
This is the only place in the country
that's at least somewhat equipped
to handle 4400s.
Do you think
that I didn't tell him that?
They weren't interested.
- lsabelle.
- Hi.
May I come in?
Are you going somewhere?
I saw Dad putting luggage
into his car.
Oh, we're just gonna try another clinic,
but we will be away for a while.
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.
No, it's all right. Thank you.
Now, if there's anything that you need,
you can talk to Shawn.
He's...
He'll be looking out for you, okay?
And...
I wanna give you this.
It's my wedding band.
I inherited it from my grandmother.
Her name was Lily too.
You used to love to play with it
when you were a little baby.
I remember.
- I used to like to bite on it.
- And my finger too.
You can wear it if you want.
I always knew
that I would give it to you one day.
It doesn't fit me anymore,
and I'd hate to lose it.
I'll keep it safe for you.
I know you will.
I'm sorry I have to leave so soon.
I wish we had more time together.
Well, when do you think
you'll be back?
It's hard to say.
Goodbye, lsabelle.
Bye.
Thank you very much.
I'll take her from here.
Thank you.
Okay,
you told her we were going over
to the hospital?
- How'd it go over?
- Oh, fine.
I had it easy. I got to lie.
You're the one
who has to tell her the truth.
What's going on?
What's happening?
We'll get him.
Funny, that's the exact same thing
Navarro said about you.
So far, he's wrong.
He never should've been moved
in the first place.
- There was no reason.
- There was every reason.
You're too soft, Tom.
I don't know what's happened to you.
No, I had him, Dennis! You lost him.
Sunset's in four hours.
At this point, we can't even say
with 1 00% certainty
that it's gonna rise again
in the morning.
And the one guy
who can tell us is gone.
That's a defeatist attitude.
We'll get him.
Yeah, I know. You keep saying that.
Hey, Shawn.
- You got something for me?
- Where's Daniel?
Busy. He sent me.
- No, no, no. That's not how we work.
- Today it is.
You can trust me.
You saved my life. I owe you.
Come on. Let's get this over with.
I feel a little naked standing out here.
Thanks.
Listen,
if there's ever anything you need--
You sold us--
Get in there, get in there.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I don't guess we'll be seeing her
in court anytime soon.
No, you did the right thing
by calling us, Shawn.
Seriously.
You're a hero.
One minute to go.
Just tell me one thing.
Are we as prepared as we can be?
The entire country's
on level-red terror alert.
All commercial air traffic
has been suspended for the day.
The National Guard
has been deployed to likely targets.
"Likely targets." Kind of a broad term.
I wish T.J. could've narrowed
that down for us.
Well, me too. But we have to keep her
sedated to inhibit her ability.
She's already turned this place
into a war zone once.
So now we wait.
Anyone else feel like they're staring
at a doomsday clock?
Well, that's it.
October 1 9th.
Looks like the world's still here.
For the moment, anyway.
Oh, my God!
- What? What happened?
- It's the Nova Group.
Certainly, "miracle"
is an imprecise term,
but I'm not sure hoW else
to describe it,
To repeat:
I'm broadcasting live from
the Nubian Desert, north of Khartoum,
Where overnight,
a thousand-acre patch of barren sand
has somehoW been transformed
into fertile Wheat fields,
Scientists are at a loss
to explain the conversion,
but tests confirm that the Wheat
is real and edible,
There hasn't been food growing
in that part of the world
since before the birth of Christ.
They make us all terrified,
and then rather than attacking us,
they give us a gift.
Our station
has just received a statement
from the radical 4400 organization
knoWn as the Nova Group,
claiming responsibility
for this morning's transformation,
You are Witnesses to the beginning
of a neW era,
What happens next is up to you,
The 4400 can be mankind's
greatest ally,
or its most dangerous adversary,
Don't kid yourself. It's an attack.
An act of aggression, anyway.
They just showed everyone
that they can change the world,
and there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.
- Hello?
- I'm very disappointed in you, Shawn.
- Daniel.
- I realize you're still a young man,
But I'm afraid I can't forgive you.
Keith, I'm broadcasting live
from the Nubian Desert,,,
It's okay, Kyle. Daddy's...
Daddy's here. I'm right here.
I'm right here.
Just go to sleep.
Hey, I'm Tyler.
Maia.
Lily,
We are here.
- Hasn't changed much, has it?
- No.
We were so happy here.
Just you and me, and the baby.
It was so much simpler.
- Would you like to head on inside?
- No, not just yet.
No, let's stay out here for a while.
It's so peaceful.
Remember When you Went
into labor?
I could hardly get the car into gear.
But you gave me directions
to the hospital.
How did you stay so calm?
Lily?
Durant les 60 derničres années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées.
Elles sont toutes revenues ensemble.
Sans aucun souvenir d'oů elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certains sont revenus avec un don.
Toutes essayent de reprendre...
...Leurs vies passées.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le Salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans les 4400...
Lily, est-ce que ça va ?
- Oů est ma femme ?
- De quoi tu parles ?
Mr. Tyler, quand elle est tombée ce matin,
votre femme était jeune.
Quand elle s'est relevée,
elle avait vieilli de 50 ans.
Etes-vous ma mčre ?
Richard, je suis mourante.
J'ai cru comprendre qu'il y a eu un accident ce matin.
Vous avez essayez de vous tuer.
Vous n'avez pas le droit de faire ça !
Vous ne comprenez pas qui vous ętes ?
Ce que vous ętes censée faire ?
Je me fais des injections avec une
version modifiée de promicine.
Mon corps va apprendre ŕ
produire de la promicine.
Et je serai le premier non disparu
ŕ avoir les męmes capacités que les 4400.
C'était T.J. Kim qui s'enfuyait du tribunal.
Quand elle est venue ici, T.J. a plongé
tous les hommes dans un rage meurtričre.
Depuis que nous leur donnons plus l'inhibiteur,
Ils peuvent développer de nouvelles capacités,
ou perfectionnent celles qu'ils avaient.
Donc ils deviennent de plus en plus dangereux.
Tu m'as sauvé la vie.
Je te suis redevable.
Tu nous as vendus.
Ca ne m'étonnerait pas qu'on la revoie
devant un juge trčs bientôt.
C'est un message du groupe Nova.
Nous sommes le mouvement défenseur des 4400.
Aujourd'hui, le monde a vu ce qui arrivait
ŕ ceux qui nous défiaient.
Une nouvelle čre commence.
Hé.
Je les prends toutes les munitions agent Baldwin.
Oh, ouais.
Bien sűr. J'oubliais, Ian. Merci.
- Vous pouvez entrer.
- Bien.
Hé, T.J.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Dr. Burkhoff ?
J'ai ce que vous m'avez demandé.
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Dites quelque chose si vous ętes lŕ.
Arrętez.
S'il vous plaît.
J'ai une migraine.
Elle est comment ?
Assez forte.
Ne vous inquiétez pas. Ce sont juste des
maux de tęte que j'ai depuis des années.
7:45.
Vous ętes juste ŕ l'heure pour mon réveil.
Ces piqűres de promicine...
A combien d'injections ętes-vous par jour ?
6.
Vous avez doublé les doses ?
Je pensais que vous ne pouviez faire ça
sans m'en parler.
Nous en parlons maintenant.
Ecoutez, j'apprends ŕ mon corps
ŕ produire un nouveau neurotransmetteur.
Et je vous garantis que je ne suis
pas le seul ŕ essayer.
Dčs le moment oů un 4400 a présenté une capacité,
les recherches ont commencé.
Quelqu'un produit du sérum de promicine
Qui permettra aux non-4400 de développer un pouvoir.
Il en sera ainsi.
Les seules questions sont quand et qui
contrôlera ce produit ?
J'espčre que quelqu'un qui possčde un grand
sens des responsabilités...
Et de jugement.
Permettez moi de vous demander...
Avez-vous rencontré beaucoup de personnes
de ce genre dans votre travail quotidien.
Beaucoup d'entre eux occupent
des postes haut placés au gouvernement
Ou sičgent dans de grandes compagnies
Pharmaceutiques ?
Dr. Burkhoff...
Je savais que vous aviez quelques...
Troubles de personnalités,
mais je ne vous savais pas cynique.
Je ne peux pas me permettre d'ętre charitable
en la nature humaine. Il y a trop en jeu ici.
Si ces expériences me coűtent quelques
maux de tęte ou blessures.
C'est le prix ŕ payer.
N'est-ce pas ?
Je suis ici, non ?
Sainte mčre.
Pourquoi faisons-nous ça ?
Tout ce que je vous dis est
déjŕ dans mon dossier. Vous le savez déjŕ.
Du calme, T.J.
Je pense juste qu'il est important que nous passions
en revue tout ce que vous avez dit aux gouvernement.
N'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Je n'arręte pas de vous dire que c'est
tout ce que je sais.
Ok.
Merci pour votre coopération.
Nous essayons juste d'avoir de solides informations.
Vous n'avez pas idée de la difficulté
de la bureaucratie.
Ouais, bref...
J'espčre que vous n'espérez pas que je dise "de rien."
Que faites-vous ?
Quoi, ça ?
C'est rien. Je nettoie juste ce qui gčne.
Faites vite. Nous partons dans 2 minutes.
Pourquoi ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Votre partenaire a vu
T.J. Kim ce matin.
Quand Tom a quitté la salle d'entretien,
T.J. était morte.
- Quoi ?
- Deux balles dans la tęte.
Apparemment, Tom est entré dans la salle
avec une arme cachée.
Le temps que le garde entre dans la pičce
et trouve le corps de T.J,
Tom avait quitté le bâtiment.
- Nous allons l'attraper maintenant.
- Attendez, attendez.
On parle de Tom lŕ.
Il doit y avoir une explication.
Peut-ętre que T.J. a utilisé sa capacité sur lui.
Non, on lui a injecté de
l'inhibiteur dans les veines.
Nous avons essayé de contacter Tom,
mais il ne répond pas au téléphone.
Nous devons l'emmener ici,
laissez-moi d'abord lui parler.
Mais laissez-moi lui parler en premier.
Il a confiance en moi.
Maintenant, c'est Tom.
Allez, nous lui devons bien ça !
Bon, ok.
Je n'essayais pas de me noyer.
Je n'aurai męme pas pu si je le voulais.
Ok.
Isabelle, j'ai juste pensé qu'aprčs tout ce
qu'il s'est passé avec Lily..
Shawn...
Ca n'a rien ŕ voir avec ma mčre.
J'apprenais ŕ nager.
Toute habillée ?
Et bien, je n'ai jamais porté de maillot avant.
Je ne savais pas comment le mettre.
Et je suis trop âgée pour demander de l'aide.
C'est embarrassant de ne pas savoir nager.
Tout le monde a appris un jour ou l'autre, Isabelle.
J'ai appris quand j'étais enfant.
Mais je n'ai jamais été enfant.
C'est pourquoi je n'ai jamais appris ŕ nager,
ou ŕ conduire, je ne suis jamais sortie avec quelqu'un.
J'ai lu des choses sur ces...
rites de passage.
Comme toutes les choses que font les
personnes avant de grandir ?
Ouais. Oui, mais j'ai grandi...
Et j'ai manqué tout ça.
Ce n’est pas juste.
Je dois faire des choses,
donc j'ai fais une liste.
Une liste ?
T'es trčs organisée.
Bon, Isabelle,
Il y a une piscine au Centre.
Je peux probablement t'apprendre les bases.
Vraiment ?
Merci, Shawn.
Papa ?
Tu avais quel âge quand tu as appris ŕ nager ?
Vers environ 11 ans je suppose.
Tu veux que je t’apprenne ?
C'est bon .Shawn a dit qu'il le ferait.
Il le fera.
Bien, assure-toi qu'il ne te fait pas
aller dans le grand bassin tout de suite.
C'est ce que ma grand-mčre m'a fait.
Ecoute, isabelle...
Je serai absent cette nuit. Si tu as besoin de
Quoi que ce soit, va voir Shawn.
Oů vas-tu ?
Je ramčne ta mčre ŕ la maison.
Oů elle reposera en paix.
Je peux venir avec toi ?
Je ne pense pas.
Je vais prendre l'avion et...
Je ne pense pas que tu sois pręte pour
T’éloigner du Centre.
Tu veux ętre seul pour lui dire
au revoir, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui, je suppose que oui.
- Tom.
- Mon Dieu !
Tu m'as fais peur, Diana.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Pourquoi tu tiens ton pistolet ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
Jarvis arrive.
Elle a quelqu'un avec elle. Tu dois venir.
De quoi tu parles ?
Tu as tué T.J. ce matin.
- Quoi ?
- Tu ne t'en souviens pas ?
M'en souvenir ? Je n'ai tiré sur personne.
Je suis resté ici toute la matinée.
Quelqu'un peut le confirmer ?
Non. Non. Je devais aller ŕ une
conférence, mais ils ont annulé.
Ecoute, j'ai pris un demi-jour de congé,
Diana. Je viens de courir, je ne suis pas allé bosser.
Tu peux arręter de dire ça,
car des personnes t'ont vu.
Maintenant, je ne sais pas ce qui se passe.
Peut-ętre que tu as des absences, comme Kyle.
Peut-ętre que c'est autre chose.
Peut-ętre que c'est une capacité de 4400.
Je veux dire, je ne sais pas, mais...
Tu dois venir.
Et il se passera quoi si je viens ?
Je serai arręté pour meurtre ?
Tu sais, on va s'occuper de ça,
Tout le monde veut t'aider.
Tu dois juste...juste venir.
Tu permets que je m'habille d'abord ?
Bien sűr.
Es-tu sűr de te rappeler tout ce que
tu as fait ce matin ?
Il n'y a pas de trou ou n'importe quoi d'autre ?
Tu ne t'es pas endormi ?
Tom ?
Tom ??
Merde.
Ouais, salut. C'est moi. Il est parti.
Je-je ne sais pas comment.
Ils ont déjŕ envoyé un agent aprčs lui.
Ecoute, désolé. Il s'est enfuit.
Quoi ?
Pas possible. C'est un agent du NTAC.
Ils s'attendront ŕ ça.
Ok.
Tu as raison. Ca doit arriver. Je le ferai.
Je le laissais s'habiller.
Je n'ai męme pas pensé qu'il sauterait
par la fenętre.
Bien, il est évident que vous sous-estimez
votre partenaire.
Etait-ce un comportement d'innocent ?
Je ne sais pas. Ecoutez,
C'était une mauvaise approche,
et j'en prends l'entičre responsabilité.
J'ai mis le FBI sur le coup.
Je leurs ai dit que Tom était recherché
pour ętre questionné sur un meurtre.
C'est un fugitif maintenant.
Oh, ne me regardez pas comme ça, Diana.
Je n'avais pas le choix.
Désolée.
- C'est Tom.
- ouais.
Tom ?
Je suis désolé d'ętre parti.
Oů es-tu ?
- Je n'ai pas tué T.J., je n'ai tué personne
Je te crois. Mais tu dois revenir, et on pourra
essayer de comprendre ce qui se passe.
Non, je n'irai pas en prison.
Personne ne te mettra en prison.
Ils ont fait ça ŕ mon fils, Diana.
Etait-ce vraiment lui qui a appuyé sur la
détente le jour de la mort de Collier ?
Il est enfermé. Non, ce n'était pas lui,
et il est enfermé.
Tu es un fugitif Tom.
Toute la police de Washington te cherche.
Certains flics veulent ętre des héros,
tu sais comment ces choses peuvent finir.
Je dois prouver que ce n'est pas moi.
Ecoute, creuse un peu, Diana. Il doit y avoir
des indices qui disent que ce n'est pas moi.
Aide-moi juste ŕ les trouver.
Vous a-t-il dit oů il était ?
Marco, aide-moi.
Si tu devais prouver que ton partenaire n'a pas
commis de crime alors que tout le monde le pense...
Par oů tu commencerais ?
Bien, je suppose que je commencerais par dire
que mon partenaire est innocent.
Ok, imagine que c'est un autre cas.
Quelle est la premičre chose que tu ferais ?
Bien, regarde les faits.
Je veux dire, il y a un cadavre,
il y a l'arme qu'a laissée Tom,
et il y a plein de personnes
qui l'ont vu ici.
Et, ils ont pleins de caméras de
sécurité non ?
T'es sérieuse ?
Tu me demandes réellement ça ?
Bien sűr que je suis sérieuse.
C'est un problčme ?
Bien, c'est juste que...
Je t'ai donné toutes les cassettes
il y a juste une heure.
De quoi tu parles ?
Je ne suis pas monté de la journée.
C'est quoi, une blague ?
Marco, allez.
Tu étais juste ici. Tu as signé pour
toutes les vidéos.
Ce n’est pas si compliqué.
C'est parce que je te tiens encore.
Trčs bien... Je vais enlever mes mains.
Tu es pręte ?
Non, pas maintenant. C'est agréable.
Agréable ?
Je me gčle.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi.
C'est une piscine supposée chauffée.
- Tu veux que je la rende plus chaude ?
- Tu peux faire ça ?
Je pense oui. Attends.
Comment tu fais ça ?
Je ne sais pas. Comment tu guéris ?
Ce n’est pas pareil, Isabelle.
Soigner est une seule chose.
C'est que nous pouvons tous faire une chose.
Pas moi. Je suppose que je suis différente.
Shawn.
Désolé de débarquer.
Nous vous attendons au conseil d'administration.
- Ca commence juste ?
- Ca fait 5 minutes.
Ils attendent.
Psst.
Alana.
Thomas, que fais-tu ici ?
J'ai des ennuis.
Mes patrons au NTAC,
ils pensent que j'ai fait quelque chose.
J'ai besoin que tu viennes avec moi.
- De quoi tu parles...
- J'ai pas le temps de t'expliquer.
Thomas!
- Allô ?
- Alana, je suis dans la rue.
J'ai besoin que tu viennes avec moi.
Chérie, j'ai des ennuis.
Ils pensent que j'ai tué quelqu'un.
Qui ętes-vous ?
Je sais que vous n'ętes pas Thomas.
De quoi tu parles ?
J'ai Thomas en face de moi.
Chérie, écoute, ce n'est pas moi.
L'homme que tu regardes,
il peut se transformer en moi.
Je ne vous crois pas.
Il est entré au NTAC ce matin
et il a tué quelqu'un.
Alana, il est dangereux. Eloigne-toi de lui.
Alana, écoute-moi
Le nom de ta mčre est Madeleine.
Tu voulais un chien étant enfant,
mais tes parents t'ont offert un oiseau,
un perroquet appelé Charly.
Ecoute, nous avons fait l'amour cette nuit.
Il y avait deux bougies.
Attends. J'arrive tout de suite.
Avais-je un chien étant petite ?
Je n'ai pas le temps pour ça.
- Que fais-tu ?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Tom ?
- Est-ce que ça va ?
- Oui.
- Oů est-il ?
- Il vient juste de sortir par l'arričre.
Hé !
Avez-vous vu un homme passer ?
Il me ressemblait.
- Je n'ai vu personne.
- Vous ętes sűr ?
Il est parti.
Il est parti.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Il est parti juste quelques secondes avant toi.
Il n'y avait personne, juste un garçon.
C'était lui.
C'était lui. Je l'avais.
T'avais qui ? De quel garçon tu parles ?
Celui qui me ressemblait.
Le gars qui a commis le meurtre.
Il te ressemblait. Il parlait comme toi.
Il se tenait prčs de moi comme tu l'es maintenant,
et il m'a complčtement dupée.
Ne t'en veux pas, il a trompé tout le NTAC aussi.
Au moins nous savons ce qui se passe.
C'est un 4400 n'est-ce pas ?
D'une façon ou d'une autre il se fait
passer pour quelqu'un d'autre.
Ouais. Je ne sais pas comment.
Je veux dire, peut-ętre qu'il a une sorte
de camouflage visuel.
Il peut convaincre le cerveau qu'on
parle ŕ la personne qu'il veut qu'on voie.
C'est un garçon. Pourquoi voudrait-il tuer quelqu'un ?
Pas juste quelqu'un.
T.J. Kim, le seul membre du groupe Nova
que nous avions attrapés.
Je veux dire, reféchis-y. C'est un bon plan.
Tu te débarrasses d'un membre de ta cellule
qui pourrait témoigner contre toi,
tu compromets un agent et le NTAC,
l'agence qui essaye de te faire tomber,
celle qui passe son temps ŕ te chercher.
Alana.
Tu devrais venir ŕ l'intérieur.
Il y a toutes sortes de gens
avec des insignes.
Ils disent faire parti du NTAC.
Ecoute, retiens-les.
Je veux que tu retournes ŕ la maison.
Je veux que tu fermes la porte,
et n'ouvre pas jusqu'ŕ ce que ce soit réglé.
Si je dois te voir...
J'utiliserai un mot de passe.
Que dis-tu de "Mort ŕ Venise" ?
Ton livre préféré. C'est un bon choix.
Ecoute, Shawn, merci de m'avoir laissé entrer.
Je sais que tu peux avoir des ennuis.
Je ne savais pas oů aller.
Ecoute, vous devez avoir une base de donnée sur les capacités
des 4400, non?
Ouai.
J'ai besoin d'y jeter un coup d'oeil.
Je veux découvrir ce qu'est ce gamin.
Je l'ai sur mon portable.
Ca peut prendre du temps.
Tu le dis si ça te gęne ?
Non, c'est bon.
Tiens.
Tu sais, oncle Tommy,
tu peux rester ici si tu veux.
Je m'en souviendrai.
Trčs bien...
Mais heu, tu prends le canapé.
Ok...
Les reins, hum ?
Ca explique le sang dans l'urine.
Kevin, nous avions un accord.
Que je vous aiderai tant que votre santé
n'est pas en danger.
Et deviner quoi..?
Je vais appeler l'hôpital.
Mais ils ne me laisseront pas faire mes
injections.
Oh, non.
Vous avez fini avec ça.
Je sais que nous avions un accord,
et je le respecterai.
Laissez-moi vous montrer quelque chose
avant d'appeler.
Qu'est-il arrivé ŕ vos ongles ?
Oh, ils sont tombés.
Dissous, vous diriez plutôt.
Si vous pensez me faire changer d'avis,
vous n'utilisez pas un bon moyen...
Kevin..
Mais qu'est-ce que vous venez de faire ?
Votre peau guérit toute seule...
d'une blessure si rapidement.
Kevin, vous avez développé une capacité de 4400.
On y arrive.
Ca ne marche pas toujours.
Ca ne marche pas toujours ?
Le scalpel est passé au travers de votre main.
Je sais, ça me rendait nerveux.
C'est marrant de conduire vite !
Ouais.
Et toutes ces infos sur le taux
de compression
et le mécanisme du ratio semble
complčtement sans rapport.
Bien, tu ne nous ramčnes pas ŕ la maison.
Sors de lŕ.
Tu as de la chance de ne pas avoir
envoyé ma voiture dans un poteau.
Y'a-t-il quoi que ce soit dans ta liste
qui implique
moins de risques de blessure ?
Nous pourrions faire l'amour.
Allez. Tu as un grand lit.
Whoa, Isabelle, hé...
heu, non.
Pourquoi ? C'est sur ma liste.
C'est un rite de passage
important pour ętre adulte.
Ca sera marrant. J'étais bonne en conduite.
Je suis sűr que tu me battras rapidement.
Je ne sais pas.
Une chose, ton pčre voudra me tuer.
Pourquoi ? Je suis assez grande.
Et bien, tu l'es et tu ne l'es pas, Isabelle.
Je dis juste qu'il a droit de donner son
avis sur le sujet.
Je ne sais pas, Isabelle. C'est comme si je
profitais de toi.
Mais je le veux.
Bien, je suis flatté. Vraiment.
Mais je ne suis pas sűr que tu sois pręte pour prendre
cette décision. Nous devons nous connaître mieux.
Je te connais mieux que n'importe
quelle personne au monde.
C'est peut ętre vrai.
Ce n'est juste pas pręt d'arriver.
Les leçons avec Isabelle se passent bien ?
Il n'y a pas de leçon,
et c'est complčtement innocent.
Faites-moi une faveur, ne me posez plus
jamais la question.
- C'est Skouris.
- Son nom est Boyd Gelder, Diana.
C'est un 4400. Je sais oů il habite.
Qui vit oů ? Qui est Boyd Gelder ?
Le garçon qui fait ça.
Il peut m'imiter je ne sais pas comment.
Et pas juste imiter.
Il peut ętre moi.
Au moins, vous faire croire que c'est moi.
Il vit avec sa mčre. Je suis dans le parc
Schenley. C'est ŕ côté de sa maison.
Bien, peux tu m'attendre ?
Je serai lŕ dans 15 minutes.
J'attendrai... mais Diana, juste toi.
Juste moi.
Nous venons juste d'arriver. Oů vas-tu ?
Au parc Schenley.
Je pense qu'on fait une pause sur le dossier de Tom.
Tom !
Tom !
Je ne l’ai dit ŕ personne
Juste Marco.
Du moins, je pensais que c'était Marco.
Je marchais dans le parc,
tu étais lŕ..
Mais c'était toi, enfin ce n’était pas toi.
Parle-moi de ça. Tu étais celui qui nous
poursuivais dans le parc.
Je veux dire, je ne cours pas comme ça, si ?
C'est une incroyable capacité. Marco va avoir
du boulot sur ça.
Bon. Laisse-le travailler lŕ-dessus.
Nous allons avoir besoin d'utiliser ce gars.
Attends, attends. Non,
Tu n'as plus besoin de courir.
Tu peux rentrer avec moi maintenant.
Je suis toujours accusé de meurtre, Diana.
Non, tu ne l'es pas.
Boyd s'est fait passer pour toi. Il a tué T.J.
Tu n'es pas responsable.
Ecoute, j'ai vu également
sa capacité juste ici.
C'est bien la preuve de quelque chose
Je te soutiendrai sur ce que tu diras.
Ce qui ne signifie rien.
Je veux dire, merci, Diana,
mais tu es ma partenaire.
Tout le monde s'attend ŕ ce que
tu me défendes.
C'est la seule façon de prouver
que je n'ai pas tuer T.J. Kim.
- Je dois attraper Boyd Gelder.
- Ok, allons-y.
Tu es sűre de vouloir venir ?
Je suis ta partenaire.
Tout le monde s'attend ŕ ce que je te soutienne.
Je serai de retour ce soir.
J'ai...
pris mon temps, je me suis promené
aux endroits préférés de ta mčre.
Tout va bien ? Tu as été aux rendez-vous
du docteur ?
Oui ŕ la plupart.
Nous devons continuez de te surveiller.
Je vais bien.
Shawn prend bien soin de moi, juste comme
tu lui as demandé. Il fait du bon boulot.
- Oh, vraiment ?
- Ouais.
Il m'a appris le dos crawlé,
Il m'a laissé conduire sa voiture...
et puis je lui ai demandé de coucher avec
moi mais il a dit non.
Il a dit que tu serais fâché. C'est vrai ?
Isabelle...
tu es trop jeune pour penser ŕ...
- ça.
- Ah bon?
Mais j'ai pensé que j'avais
presque 20 ans.
Tu avais quel âge quand tu as perdu
ta virginité ?
Il y a...
Les choses étaient différentes de mon temps.
 Ce n'est pas pareil.
Vraiment ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu sais quoi, Isabelle ?
Je ne vais pas avoir cette
discussion avec toi au téléphone.
Donc Shawn avait raison. Tu es fâché.
Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi le NTAC veut parler
ŕ mon fils de toute façon ?
Il a des ennuis. Nous ne pouvons en parler ici.
Nous devons juste lui parler.
Bien, Il n'est pas lŕ.
Il est parti faire du ski avec des amis,
et il ne revient que demain.
Madame...
votre fils n'est pas parti au ski et c'est sérieux.
Y a t-il un moyen de le contacter ?
D'abord, dites-moi ce qui se passe.
Vous pensez que mon fils a fait quoi ?
Mme Gelder, il y a de nombreux agents qui recherchent votre fils...
Des situations pareilles peuvent dégénérées.
Des gens peuvent ętre blesser.
Plus tôt il sera avec nous, et plus tôt il sera en sécurité.
Donc pourquoi ne l'appelez-vous pas pour
le convaincre de venir me parler.
Boyd est en retard,
Je me demande s'il va venir.
Attendons encore quelques minutes.
Une gentille mčre, une belle maison...
on peut se demander...
Si le groupe Nova ont engrainé ce gosse,
Qui d'autre peuvent-ils entraînés ?
Tout le monde continue de dire
que les 4400 sont lŕ pour sauver le monde.
- Quoique cela signifie.
- Exactement.
Regarde ce que nous avons sur le groupe Nova.
Ils semblent vraiment avoir une stratégie.
Je suis sure qu'ils cachent quelque chose.
Bien, je suppose juste,
Mais je ne pense pas que ce soit Boyd.
Que diable fait la NTAC ici ?
Peut-ętre que Boyd a senti le pičge
et les a avertis.
- Thomas
- Alena, ouvre-moi.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais lŕ ?
Il y a des agents de la NTAC qui surveillent la maison.
Ils viennent de partir. Ils doivent changer
de position. Allez, laisse-moi entrer.
Mort ŕ Venise, ok ? Ouvre.
Je ne veux pas que quelqu'un me voit entrer.
Allez.
Qu'as-tu fait de tes clés ?
Je les ai perdues. Ca a dű arriver
quand je courais.
Allez. C'est moi, Tom, Alena
Je t'ai donné le mot de passe.
S'il vous plaît, ne m'y obligé pas,
Je n'ai rien contre vous.
Tom... c'est ta maison.
Alana ?
Je viens d'écrire une lettre sur ton ordinateur.
Tu dois venir la signer.
- Boyd ?
- C'est une lettre d'aveu.
Ca dit que vous avez craqué avec le meurtre
qu'a commis votre fils.
Vous avez tué T.J., et maintenant vous ne pouvez plus vivre avec ça,
Donc vous avez décidé de vous suicider.
Oů est Alana ? Qu'avez-vous fait ?
Elle est ma carte "sortie de prison".
Vous ętes le seul qui peut
m'identifier.
Tous les autres ont juste vu double,
On les prendra pour des fous.
Je ne signerai pas la lettre d'adieu,
Boyd. Passe-moi Alana.
Oh, tu signeras, parce que soit je te tue...
soit je la tue.
C'est un choix.
Ta vie contre la sienne.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je ne pense pas que je te laisserai faire, Tom.
Nous devons appeler Jarvis. Nous devons bloquer
la rue. Nous devons entourer la maison.
- Il a Alana.
- Tom.
Il veut te tuer. Nous n'allons pas lui faciliter la tâche.
Si Maia était dedans...tu appellerais Jarvis ?
Vous aimez ?
Pourquoi vous m'offrez ça ?
Vous ętes une jeune femme. Vous devez avoir
une belle robe.
Elle doit bien vous aller.
Essayez-la.
Merci.
Je vois que vous passez beaucoup
de temps avec Shawn.
Et ?
Je pense que c'est trčs bien.
Shawn est un jeune homme trčs seul.
Il ne voit pas beaucoup de jeunes
de son âge.
Je pense que...vous devriez ętre
plus proche de lui.
Matthew ?
Shawn est gentil.
Ce que je fais avec lui, ce n'est pas pour vous,
et je n'essaye pas de l'utiliser.
Bien sűr que non...
mais éventuellement, Isabelle,
Vous et Shawn allez ętre de chaque côté
d'une grande idéologie,
Donc... profitez de votre amitié...
Mais ne laissez pas courir vos émotions.
Elles feront des choses
plus compliquées plus tard.
Quelles choses ?
Vous le saurez.
Elle ne correspond pas ŕ vos yeux.
Occupez-vous en.
Tu étais une femme magnifique.
Vous deux.
Vous étiez vraiment les męmes.
Je ne pourrai jamais savoir pourquoi.
D'une façon ou d'une autre j'ai eu une
Lily dans ma vie pendant plus de 50 ans.
Tout ça est terminé maintenant...
Et je ne sais pas quoi faire...
Mais, euh...
Je me sens mieux car je sais que
vous ętes toutes les deux...
Pour toujours.
C'est pour toi, tu sais.
Je ne sais pas quel genre de conte de fées
le groupe Nova t'a racontée
Mais ça n'a pas d'importance.
Ta vie est terminée.
Ils t'ont envoyée dans une mission suicide.
J'étais volontaire, et je ne pense pas que
vous ętes en position de me donner des conseils.
Tu es une 4400.
Tu es spéciale.
Tu es sensée changer les choses.
Et non vivre avec un agent de la NTAC.
Et qu'est-ce que tu changes, Boyd ?
Tu as tué une fille.
En quoi le monde va mieux ?
T.J. Kim était un soldat.
Elle préférait que je la tue
plutôt qu'elle nous trahisse.
Tout le monde parle de sauver le monde.
Męme dans le passé.
Tout est devenu mauvais,
désastre aprčs désastre...
Mais nous montrons au monde
une alternative.
Nous allons lui faire prendre un
autre chemin...
Par la force si nous le devons.
Comment pouvez-vous ne pas voir la catastrophe
et rester lŕ ŕ ne rien faire ?
Vous avez entendu ?
Arrętez ça !
Bougez plus, vous deux ! Arrętez, ou je tire.
Bien joué, Alana. On l'a eu. Ferme-la !
Alena, Mort ŕ Venise.
Ouais, c'est le mot de passe.
Allez Alena, Alana. Donne-moi le pistolet.
On appellera la NTAC. C'est fini.
Alena, c'est moi Tom,
Pose-moi une question. N'importe quoi.
Te fais pas avoir avec ça.
Il a probablement lu mon dossier. Il sait
sur nous. Ne l'écoute pas.
Demande-moi n'importe quoi
ŕ propos de nous deux.
Quelque chose que moi seul connaitrait.
N'importe quoi.
Taisez-vous tous les deux.
Bébé...
Je suis si fier de toi.
Billy aurait été fier aussi.
Tu sais pour Billy ?
Ouais. C'était ton fils.
Il est mort dans un accident
de voiture.
Alena, il a fait des recherches.
Tout le monde peut trouver ça.
Donne-moi le pistolet. Donne-le moi--
Donne-moi le pistolet.
Alena, donne-moi le pistolet.
Non. Alena...
Donne-moi le pistolet.
Au sol.
Quoi ?
Non, tu te trompes.
Réfléchis.
J'ai dit ŕ terre.
Ne bouge pas.
Tu es juste un garçon.
Je suis un soldat.
Et on est de plus en plus nombreux
chaque jour.
Allons-y, soldat.
Bon retour parmi nous.
Ouais, merci. Tout va bien ?
Oui, merci, et merci de garder
un oeil sur Isabelle.
Oh, bien, ce n'est pas un problčme.
Je n'ai pas fait grand-chose.
Ouais, bien, merci quand męme.
Je m'inquičte pour elle.
Vous ne devriez pas.
Elle semble aller trčs bien.
Je suis son pčre. C'est mon rôle.
Et c'est plus dur avec elle.
Les gens qui la voient, ils voient une femme,
Une femme magnifique...
Et ils peuvent oublier qu'ŕ l'intérieur
elle n'est qu'une petite fille.
Mais...
Je suis heureux qu'elle t'ait...
Comme un ami.
Shawn.
Comment t'es entrée ?
Je peux faire des trucs, tu te souviens ?
Ouais.
Donc, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu as besoin de quelque chose ?
Juste une chose.
Elle est sur ma liste.
Mon premier baiser.
C'est mal Isabelle.
Ok.

We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
Lily, are you all right?
- Where's my wife?
- What are you talking about?
Mr. Tyler, when your wife fainted this
morning, she was a young woman.
When she woke up
less than a minute later,
she was 50 years older?
Are you my mother?
Richard, I'm dying.
I understand there was
an incident this morning.
You attempted to harm yourself.
You had no right to do that!
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin.
And then I will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.
That was T.J. Kim
running from the courthouse.
When she hit, T.J. drove every man
in the building into a homicidal rage.
Ever since we took them
off the inhibitor,
they're either developing
new abilities
or they're refining the ones
that they've got.
So they are getting more dangerous.
You saved my life. I owe you.
You sold us out.
I don't guess we'll be seeing her
in court anytime soon.
This is a message
from the Nova Group,
We are the defensive Wing
of the 4400,
Today, the World has seen
What happens
to those Who try to harm us,
A neW era daWns,
Hi.
I'll need your auxiliary rounds as well,
Agent Baldwin.
Oh, yeah.
Of course. I forgot again.
- Thanks. You can go in.
- Great.
Hi, T.J.
What do you want?
Dr. Burkhoff?
I have your prescriptions.
Hello?
Say something if you're here.
No, don't.
Please.
I've been having migraines.
How severe?
Bad enough.
Don't worry. They're just headaches.
I've been getting them for years.
Seven forty-five.
You're just in time
for my wake-up call.
These promicin shots,
how many a day are you up to now?
Six.
You've doubled your dosage?
I thought you weren't gonna do that
without talking to me.
We're talking now.
Look, I'm training my body
to produce a new neurotransmitter.
And I guarantee you,
I'm not the only one trying.
The moment the first 4400
manifested an ability,
an arms race began.
Someone is going to produce
a promicin serum
that will cause non-4400s
to develop extraordinary abilities.
It will happen.
And the only questions are:
who's going to do it?
And who's going to control it?
Hopefully, someone with a highly
developed sense of responsibility.
And some judgment.
Let me ask you,
do you meet many people like that
in your day-to-day affairs?
Do a lot of them
hold high-ranking government posts
or sit on the board
of giant pharmaceutical companies?
Dr. Burkhoff, I knew
that you had some personality quirks,
but I never pegged you for a cynic.
I can't afford to have a charitable view
of human nature.
There's too much at stake here.
If these experiments
cost me some headaches,
some sores,
I'd say that's a price worth paying.
Wouldn't you?
I'm here, right?
Holy mother!
Why are we doing this?
Everything I'm telling you,
it's all in my file.
You know it already.
Relax, T.J.
I just think it's important we review
everything you told
the government so far.
- Have we?
- Yes.
I keep telling you, yes.
That's everything I know.
Okay.
Thanks for your cooperation.
We're just trying
to consolidate information.
You'd be amazed how hard
that can be in a bureaucracy.
Yeah, well, I hope you don't expect
me to say, "You're welcome."
What are you doing?
What, this?
It's nothing.
I'm just wrapping up the interview.
Get geared up.
We're leaving in two minutes.
What for? What's going on?
Your partner registered
to see T.J. Kim this morning.
When Tom left the interview room,
T.J. was dead.
- What?
- Two gunshot wounds to the head.
Apparently, Tom snuck a small firearm
into the interrogation room.
By the time the guard went in
and found T.J.'s body,
Tom had already left the building.
- I'm going to pick him up now.
- Oh, wait, wait.
This is Tom we're talking about, here.
There's gotta be some explanation.
Now, maybe T.J.
used her ability on him.
No, she had concentrated promicin
inhibitor pumping through her veins.
We tried to contact Tom,
but he hasn't been picking up.
We need to get him in
and figure out what happened.
Okay, well just let me talk to him first.
He trusts me.
Look, this is Tom.
Come on, we owe him that much.
Yeah, okay.
I wasn't trying to drown myself.
I don't even know if I could.
Okay.
Isabelle, I just thought that after
everything that happened with Lily--
Shawn, this has nothing to do
with my mother.
I was teaching myself to swim.
In your clothes?
I never wore a bathing suit before.
I didn't know what to get.
And I'm too old to ask for help.
It's embarrassing
not knowing how to swim.
Everybody's got to learn sometime,
lsabelle.
I learned when I was a kid.
But I never was a kid.
That's why I never learned
how to swim or how to drive.
Or ever went out on a date.
I keep reading
about all these rites of passage.
Like stuff everyone goes through
before they grow up, yeah?
Yeah, but I am grown up.
And I missed out on all of it.
It's not fair.
- I've got to catch up, so I made a list.
- A list?
That's pretty organized.
Well, lsabelle,
there is a pool at the Center.
I could probably teach you
the basics.
Really?
Thanks, Shawn.
Dad?
How old were you
when you learned how to swim?
Oh, about 1 1, I guess.
Why? You want me to teach you?
That's okay. Shawn said he'd do it.
Oh, he did, did he?
Well,
make sure he doesn't throw you
in the deep end right away.
That's what my grandmother
did to me.
Look, lsabelle.
I'm gonna be gone overnight.
- If you need anything, go see Shawn.
- Where are you going?
I'm gonna take your mother home.
I'm putting her to rest.
Well, can I come with you?
I don't think so.
I'm flying
and to tell you the truth,
I don't think you're ready to be away
from the Center yet.
You want to be alone with her
when you say goodbye, don't you?
Yeah. I guess I do.
- Tom.
- Oh, God!
You scared the hell out of me, Diana.
What are you doing here?
Why is your gun out?
What the hell is going on?
Jarvis is on her way over,
she's got everyone with her.
You need to come in.
- Why? What are you talking about?
- You shot T.J. Kim this morning.
- What?
- You don't remember?
Don't remember?
I didn't shoot anybody.
- I've been here all morning.
- Can someone confirm that?
No, no, I was supposed to have
a conference call with Kyle's attorneys.
They cancelled, though.
Look, I took a half a personal day,
Diana.
I went jogging. I wasn't at work.
You gotta stop saying that because
two dozen people saw you there.
Look, I don't know
what's going on. I--
Maybe you're blacking out
like Kyle did.
Maybe it's something else.
Maybe it's like some 4400 ability.
I mean, I don't know,
but you gotta come in.
And what happens if I do?
- I get arrested for murder?
- You know, we'll figure it out, okay?
Everyone wants to help you.
You just have to come in.
- You mind if I get dressed first?
- Oh, sure.
Are you sure you remember everything
you did this morning?
Like there's no time gaps
or anything?
You didn't take a nap?
Because, Tom...
Tom?
Damn it!
Yeah, hi, it's me. He got away.
I don't know how.
They only sent one agent after him.
Look, sorry. He got away.
What? No way. He's an NTAC agent.
He'll be expecting that.
Okay.
You're right. This has to happen.
I'll do it.
I was letting him get dressed.
I didn't think he would jump
from a second story window.
Well, obviously you underestimated
your partner's resolve.
- Does he still seem blameless to you?
- I don't know.
Look, it was a really bad call
and I take full responsibility.
I've alerted local law enforcement,
the FBl.
I've told them that Tom
is wanted for questioning
in connection with a murder.
He's a fugitive now.
Oh, don't give me that look, Diana.
I had no choice.
Sorry.
- It's Tom.
- Yeah.
Tom.
I'm sorry I ran out on you,
- Where are you?
- I didn't kill T.J. I didn't kill anyone.
I believe you. But you have to come in,
we can figure out what's going on.
- No, I'm not going to jail,
- No one's gonna put you in prison.
They did it to my son, Diana,
Was it really him that pulled the trigger
the day Jordan Collier died?
No, it wasn't, was it?
It was that thing inside of him.
- And where's Kyle? He's incarcerated.
- You're a fugitive,
Every police department
in Washington is looking for you.
NoW, some local cop
Wants to be a hero, spots you,
you know how these things can end.
No, it's gonna end with me
proving I didn't do this.
Look, dig around, Diana,
There's got to be some evidence
that'll clear me.
Just help me find it.
Did he give you a location?
Marco, help me out here.
If you were trying to prove
that your partner didn't commit a crime
that the whole world thinks he did,
where would you start?
Well, I guess I'd start by pretending
that my partner wasn't involved.
Okay, just think of it
like any other case.
What's the first thing you do
when you start?
Well, look at the evidence.
I mean, there's a dead body.
There's the gun that Tom left behind.
And there's a bunch of people
that saw him here.
Well, they've got security cameras
down in the detention ward, right?
You're serious?
You're really asking me
for all that footage?
Of course I'm serious.
Is that a problem?
Well, it's just...
I gave all the tapes to him,
like, an hour ago.
What are you talking about?
I haven't been up here all day.
What is this, a joke?
Marco, come on.
You were just here.
You signed for all the footage
from the detention ward.
- This isn't so hard.
- That's because I haven't let go yet.
All right, I'm gonna move my hands.
Are you ready?
No, not yet.
I'm kind of comfortable.
You're kind of comfortable?
I'm freezing.
I don't know what's going on.
- This pool is supposed to be heated.
- Want me to make it warmer?
- Oh, you can do that?
- I think so. Hold on.
How do you do that?
I don't know. How do you heal?
It's not the same, lsabelle.
Healing's one thing.
That's what we can all do, one thing.
Not me. I guess I'm different.
Shawn? I'm sorry to barge in.
We're scheduled to brief
the board of directors.
- That's starting now?
- Five minutes ago. They're on hold.
Alana.
Thomas. What are you doing here?
I'm in trouble. My bosses at NTAC,
they think I did something.
- I need you to come.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't have time to explain. Just--
- Thomas!
- Hello?
- Alana,
I'm right down the street.
I need you to come meet me.
Honey, I'm in trouble,
Everyone thinks I killed somebody,
- Who is this? I know it's not Thomas.
- What are you talking about?
I'm looking at Thomas right noW,
Honey, listen. That's not me.
The man you're looking at,
he can impersonate me somehow.
I don't believe you.
He Walked into NTAC
and he shot someone this morning,
Alana, he's dangerous,
get away from him.
Alana, listen to me, Your mother's
middle name is Madeleine,
You wanted a dog when you were
a kid, your parents gave you a bird.
A parakeet named Charlie.
Listen, we made love last night.
There were two candles burning.
Just hold on. I'll be right there.
- Did I have a dog?
- I don't have time for this.
- What are you doing? Let me go!
- What's going on, Tom?
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Where is he?
- He just ran through the back.
Hey!
Did you see a guy come down
this alley? He looked exactly like me.
- I didn't see anybody.
- You sure?
He's gone. He's gone.
What do you mean?
He just ran out a few seconds ago.
There was no one here.
Just some kid...
It was him. It had to be.
I had him. I had him.
Had who?
What kid are you talking about?
The one who's impersonating me.
The guy who's framing me
for murder.
He looked like you,
he sounded like you.
He was standing
as close as you are to me right now.
And he had me completely fooled.
Don't feel bad.
He fooled everyone at NTAC too.
At least we know
what's going on now.
- He's a 4400, isn't he?
- Yeah.
Somehow he can
pass himself off as you.
Yeah, I'm not sure how.
I mean, maybe he's got
some kind of optical camouflage.
He convinces your brain you're talking
to whoever he wants you to see.
He's a boy.
Why would he want to kill anyone?
Not just anybody. T.J. Kim.
The one member
of the Nova Group we had in custody.
I mean, think about it.
It's a good plan.
You get rid of the one member
of your cell
who could testify against you.
You compromise
a government agent.
And NTAC, the one agency
that's trying to hunt you down,
is wasting their time
chasing one of their own.
Alana.
You might want to get in here.
There's all kind of people
flashing badges everywhere.
They say they're NTAC agents.
Look, stall them.
I want you to go home.
I want you to lock the doors
and don't open it
until this is all cleared up.
If I need to get ahold of you,
I'll use a password.
How about Death in Venice?
Your favorite book.
It's a good choice.
Listen, Shawn,
thanks for letting me come in here.
I know it puts you at risk.
I just didn't know where else to go.
Look, you guys must have a database
of 4400s here, right?
- Yeah.
- I need to get a look
and find out who this kid is.
Here, I can pull it up
on my laptop for you.
This might take a while,
you mind if I let myself out?
No, that's fine.
There you go. You know,
Uncle Tommy,
you can stay here if you want.
- I might take you up on it.
- All right.
But, hey, you get the couch.
Okay.
Kidneys, huh?
That explains the blood in the urine.
Kevin, we had a deal.
I was gonna help you through this
as long as it wasn't compromising
your health.
Well, guess what?
I'm calling the hospital.
But they won't let me take my shots.
Oh, no. You're done with your shots.
I know we had an agreement.
And I'll honor it.
Just let me show you something
before you call.
What happened to your fingernails?
They fell off.
Dissolved, I guess you'd say.
God, if you're trying to change my
mind, you're not doing a very good job.
Kevin, what the hell did you just do?
Your tissue is healing itself
from trauma that quickly?
Kevin, you've developed
a 4400 ability.
It's getting there.
It doesn't always work.
Doesn't always work?
You just put a scalpel
- through the back of your hand.
- I know.
I was nervous about that.
- These are fun to drive fast.
- Yeah.
You know, all that information
about compression rates
and gear ratios
just seems completely irrelevant.
Well, you're not driving home.
Get out of there.
You're lucky you didn't wrap my car
around a pole.
Is there anything on this list of yours
that involves, you know,
a little less risk of bodily harm?
We could have sex.
Come on, you have a big bed.
Isabelle. Hey, hey.
- No.
- Why? It's on my list.
It's an important rite of passage
into adulthood.
It'll be fun. I was good at driving.
I'm sure you'd catch on real quick.
I don't know.
For one thing,
your dad would kill me.
Why? I'm an adult.
Well, you are
and you aren't, lsabelle.
Let's just say he has a right
to have an opinion on the matter.
I don't know, lsabelle. I feel like
I'd be taking advantage of you.
But I want to.
I'm flattered. I really am.
But I just don't think you're ready
to make that decision.
We barely know each other.
I know you better
than I know anyone else in the world.
That may be true.
It's still not gonna happen.
Lessons with lsabelle going well?
Not lessons
and it's completely innocent.
Do me a favor and
don't ask about them again.
- This is Skouris.
- His name is Boyd Gelder, Diana.
He's a 4400. I know where he lives.
Where who lives?
Who's Boyd Gelder?
The kid Who's doing this,
He can imitate me somehow.
And not just imitate. He can be me.
At least make you think he's me.
He lives with his mom. I'm in
Schenley Park. It's right by his house.
Well, can you wait for me?
I'll be 1 5 minutes.
I'll wait. But, Diana, just you.
Just me.
We just got here.
Where are you going?
Schenley Park. I think
we caught a break on Tom's case.
Tom!
Tom!
I didn't tell anyone, Tom.
Just Marco.
At least I thought it was Marco.
I looked across the park,
you were standing there.
It was you.
- But it wasn't.
- Listen, tell me about it.
You weren't the one actually
chasing yourself across the park.
I mean, I don't really run like that,
do l?
It's an amazing ability.
Marco's gonna have a field day
over this.
Good. Get him working on it.
We'll need a way to handle this guy
when we get him into custody.
Well, wait, wait, wait.
No, you don't need
to skulk around anymore.
You can come in with me now.
I'm still on the hook
for murder, Diana.
No, you're not. Boyd posed as you.
He shot T.J. Kim.
You're not responsible.
Listen, I just saw his abilities
with my own eyes.
That's proof of something,
right there.
I will back you up
on everything you say.
Which means exactly nothing.
Thank you, Diana,
but you're my partner.
Everyone expects you
to stand up for me.
There's only one way to prove
I didn't kill T.J. Kim.
- I have to get Boyd Gelder.
- Okay, let's go.
Are you sure you want to come?
I'm your partner.
Everyone expects
that I'll stand up for you.
I should be back by tonight.
I've been taking my time,
stopping off at all the places
your mother liked.
Everything okay? You been going
to your doctor's appointments?
- Most of them.
- Isabelle,
- We'll need to keep monitoring you.
- I'm fine,
Shawn's been taking good care of me
just like you asked.
He's doing a really good job.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah,
He taught me the back stroke.
He let me drive his car.
And then I asked him
to have sex with me, but he said no.
He said you'd be angry
if we did. Is that true?
Isabelle,
you're too young
to be thinking about
- that.
- I am?
But I thought I was almost 20.
What--?
How old were you
when you lost your virginity?
It was--
Things were a bit different in my day.
It's not the same.
It's not?
Why?
You know what, lsabelle?
I'm not having this conversation
with you over the phone.
So, Shawn was right. You are mad.
I don't understand.
What does NTAC wanna talk
to my son for, anyway?
Look, he's in some trouble
we can't discuss.
We just needed to talk to him.
Well, he's not here.
He went away on a ski-trip
with some friends
and won't be back till tomorrow.
Ma'am,
your son is not on a ski-trip
and this is serious.
Is there any way
you can contact him?
First, tell me what's going on.
I mean, what is it
you think my son did?
Mrs. Gelder, there are a lot of agents
looking for Boyd.
Situations like this
can get very chaotic.
People get hurt. The sooner we get
to your son, the safer he'll be.
So why don't you call him
and convince him you need to see him.
Boyd's late.
I wonder if he'll even show.
Let's just give him
another few minutes.
Nice mom. Nice house.
It makes you wonder.
If the Nova Group can turn this kid,
who else have they gotten to?
Everyone keeps telling the 4400
they're here to save the world.
- Whatever that means.
- Exactly.
I mean, say what you like about Nova,
they do seem to have a game plan.
I'm sure that helps
their recruiting pitch.
Well, I'm just guessing,
but I don't think that's Boyd.
How the hell did NTAC get here?
Maybe Boyd figured out it was a trap
and tipped them off.
- Thomas.
- Alana, open up.
What are you doing here?
NTAC agents are watching the house.
They just drove away.
They must be changing shifts
or something. Come on, let me in.
Death in Venice, okay? Open up.
I don't want anyone to see me
standing out here. Come on.
What did you do with your key?
I lost it. I must have lost it
while I was running around.
Come on, it's me, Tom, Alana.
I gave you the password.
Please don't make me.
I don't have anything against you.
Tom, it says it's your house.
- Alana?
- I Wrote a letter on your computer,
You need to come sign it.
- Boyd?
- It's a confession,
It says you cracked under the strain
of the murder charges
against your son.
You shot T.J.
and now you can't live with it.
- So you decided to kill yourself.
- Where is Alana? What did you do?
It's my get-out-of-jail-free card.
See, you're the only one
who can identify me.
Everyone else,
they've just been seeing double.
- They'll sound crazy.
- I'm not signing a suicide note, Boyd,
- Put Alana on the phone.
- Oh, you'll sign,
Because either I shoot you
or I shoot her.
It's a trade.
Your life for hers.
You know what?
I don't think I can let you do this, Tom.
We need to call Jarvis.
We need to block off the street.
We need to surround your house.
- He has Alana.
- Tom, he wants to kill you.
The least we can do
is make it a little bit difficult for him.
If it was Maia in there,
would you call Jarvis?
Do you like it?
Why did you bring this to me?
You're a young woman.
A young woman
should have a nice dress.
This is gonna look good on you.
See for yourself.
Thank you.
I see you've been
spending a lot of time with Shawn.
So?
Well, I think it's wonderful.
Shawn's a very isolated young man.
He doesn't get to spend much time
around people his own age.
I think
you should get
as close to him as you can.
Matthew?
Shawn's nice.
And what I'm doing with him
is not for you
and it's not because
I'm trying to use him.
Of course not.
But eventually, lsabelle,
you and Shawn
are gonna be on opposite sides
of a very large ideological divide.
So enjoy your friendship.
But don't let your emotions
run too deep.
If you do,
it'll make things more difficult later.
- What things?
- You'll know.
It doesn't match your eyes.
You should take care of that.
You were a beautiful woman.
Both of you.
You looked exactly alike.
I never could figure out why.
But one way or the other,
I've had a Lily in my life
for over 50 years.
That's all gone now.
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.
But it makes me feel better
knowing the two of you are together.
Forever.
This is it for you, you know.
I don't know what kind of fairy tale
the Nova Group sold you,
but it doesn't matter
what happens to me or Tom.
Your life is over.
They sent you on a suicide mission.
I volunteered.
And I don't think you're in any spot
to be giving me advice.
You're a 4400.
You're special.
You're supposed to be
changing things.
Instead you live
with an NTAC agent.
And what are you going to change,
Boyd?
You killed a girl.
How does that
make the world better?
T.J. Kim was a soldier.
She would rather have me
put a bullet in her head than betray us.
Everyone talks
about saving the world.
Meanwhile, for the past 50 years,
everything's been turning bad.
One disaster after another.
But we're gonna show the world
a new way.
We're gonna take them down
a new path.
By force if we have to.
I mean, can't you see?
The real catastrophe
is to sit back and do nothing.
Did you hear that?
Stop it.
- Stop it, both of you. Stop or I'll shoot.
- Nice work, Alana. We got him.
Shut up!
- Alana, Death in Venice,
- Yeah, that's the password.
Come on, Alana. Give me the gun.
We'll call NTAC. It's over.
Alana, it's me, Tom.
Ask me a question. Anything--
Wait, don't fall for it.
He's probably read my file.
He knows everything about us.
Don't listen to him.
Ask me something about us.
Something only I would know.
Anything about us.
Shut up, both of you.
Baby, I am so proud of you.
Billy would have been proud.
- You know about Billy?
- Yeah.
That was your son.
He died in a car accident.
Alana, he did research.
Anyone could find that out.
Give me the gun.
Just give me the gun.
Alana, give me the gun.
- No.
- Alana, give me the gun.
- Come on.
- Get down on the ground.
What? No, no.
You've got the wrong one.
- Think about this.
- I said get down.
Hold still, Boyd.
Don't move.
You're just a boy.
I'm a soldier.
- And there are more of us every day.
- Let's go, soldier.
Hey, welcome back.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Did everything go okay?
Yeah, thank you.
And thank you
for keeping an eye on lsabelle.
Oh, well.
It's not a problem.
I didn't really do much.
Yeah, well, thank you, anyway.
I worry about her.
Well, you don't really need to.
She seems to be getting along
really well.
I'm her father. It's my job.
And it's harder with lsabelle.
People see her, they see a woman.
A beautiful woman.
And they might forget
that inside she's just a little girl.
Still,
I'm glad she has you around,
to be a friend.
Shawn.
- How'd you get in here?
- I can do stuff, remember?
Yeah.
So, what's up? What do you need?
Just one thing.
It's on my list.
First kiss.
This isn't smart, lsabelle.
Okay.
Durant les 60 dernières années
4400 personnes ont été enlevées...
Toutes sont revenues en même temps.
Sans aucun souvenir d'où elles étaient
Elles n'avaient pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines étaient revenues
avec de nouvelles capacités.
Tous essaient de renouer....
...avec une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le Salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans "les 4400"...
Lily.
Tu vas bien ?
Où est ma femme ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
M. Tyler, quand votre femme a perdu connaissance ce matin.
Elle était une jeune femme.
Quand elle s'est réveillée moins d'une minute
plus tard, elle avait vieilli de 50 ans...
Etes-vous ma mère ?
Richard, je suis mourante.
J'ai cru comprendre qu'il y a eu un incident
ce matin. Tu as essayé de te faire du mal.
Tu n'as pas le droit de faire ça !
Ne comprends-tu pas qui tu es ?
Ce que tu dois faire ici ?
Je m'injecte une version
modifiée de ce sérum.
Je vais apprendre à mon corps
comment produire de la promicine.
Ainsi je deviendrais le premier non disparu
à développer des capacités comme les 4400.
C'était bien T.J. Kim qui s'est enfuie du tribunal.
Quand elle est arrivée ici, T.J. a plongé tous
les hommes du bâtiment dans une rage meurtrière.
Depuis que nous avons arrêté l'inhibiteur,
Soit ils développent de nouvelles capacités,
soit ils affinent celles qu'ils avaient déjà.
Donc ils deviennent de plus en plus dangereux.
Tu m’as sauvé la vie.
Je te suis redevable.
Tu nous as piégé.
Je ne crois pas qu'on va la revoir
au tribunal de si tôt.
Ceci est un message du groupe Nova.
Nous sommes la cellule protectrice des 4400.
Aujourd'hui, le monde a vu ce qui arrive à ceux
qui essayent de nous tuer.
Une nouvelle ère arrive.
Salut.
Vous devez aussi me donner vos munitions
supplémentaires, agent Baldwin.
Oh, oui.
Bien sûr. Les voici.
- Merci.
Vous pouvez y aller.
- Merci.
Salut, T.J.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Dr. Burkhoff ?
J'ai vos médicaments.
Y'a quelqu'un ?
Dites quelque chose si vous êtes là.
Arrêtez.
S'il vous plaît.
J'ai des migraines.
Ca vous fait mal ?
Assez mal.
Ne vous inquiétez pas. Ce ne sont que
des maux de tête. J'en ai depuis des années.
7h45.
Vous êtes juste à l'heure pour mon
injection du réveil.
Ces injections de promicine...
Vous en êtes à combien par jour ?
Six.
Vous avez doublé vos doses ?
Je pensais que vous ne deviez pas faire ça
sans m'en parler.
Nous en parlons en ce moment.
Ecoutez. J'entraîne mon corps à
produire un nouveau neurotransmetteur.
Et je vous assure que je ne suis pas le seul.
Au moment où le premier 4400 a manifesté une capacité.
Une course aux armements a débuté.
Quelqu'un va produire un sérum de promicine
Qui aura pour cause le développement de capacités
extraordinaires chez des non-4400.
Il en sera ainsi.
Les seules questions sont "Qui va le faire ?"
et "Qui en aura le contrôle ?"
Espérons que ce soit quelqu'un doué d'un sens
des responsabilités très développé
Et d'une qualité de jugement.
Laissez-moi vous posez une question.
Avez-vous rencontré beaucoup de personnes
de ce genre dans votre travail quotidien ?
Sont-ils hauts placés au sein du gouvernement ?
Ou apparaissent sur les plaques
des grandes compagnies pharmaceutiques ?
Dr. Burkhoff...
Je savais que vous aviez quelques...
Troubles de la personnalité, mais je
ne vous savez pas cynique.
Je ne peux pas me permettre d'être charitable envers
la nature humaine.
Il y a trop de choses en jeu ici.
Si ces expériences me coûtent quelques
maux de têtes... quelques blessures...
Je dirais que c'est le prix à payer.
Pas vous ?
Je suis là, non ?
Sainte Mère...
Pourquoi faisons-nous cela ?
Tout ce que je vous raconte... tout est
dans mon dossier. Vous le savez déjà.
Du calme, T.J.
Je pense seulement qu'il est important
Que nous revoyons tout ce que tu as dit au gouvernement.
N'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Je n'arrête pas de vous dire que
c'est tout ce que je sais.
D'accord.
Merci de ta coopération.
Nous essayons seulement de consolider
les informations.
Tu serais surprise de voir comme
c'est difficile avec la bureaucratie.
Oui, et bien...
J'espère que vous n'attendez pas de moi
que je vous dise "De rien."
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Quoi, ça ?
C'est rien. Je nettoie juste
ce qui gène.
Activez-vous. Nous partons dans 2 minutes.
Pour quoi faire ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Votre partenaire est passé voir T.J ce matin.
Quand Tom a quitté la salle d'interrogatoire,
T.J. était morte.
Quoi ?
- Deux balles en pleine tête.
Apparemment, Tom a introduit une arme à feu
dans la salle d'interrogatoire.
Le temps que le garde aille dans
la salle et trouve le corps de T.J,
Tom avait déjà quitté le bâtiment.
Nous devons le récupérer maintenant.
- Attendez, attendez.
C'est de Tom dont nous parlons là.
Il doit y avoir une explication.
Peut-être que T.J. a utilisé sa capacité sur lui.
Non, elle avait un concentré d'inhibiteur de promicine
dans les veines.
On a essayé de joindre Tom,
mais il ne répond pas au téléphone.
Nous devons le ramener ici pour
trouver ce qui s'est passé.
Ok, ok. Laissez-moi d'abord lui parler.
Il me fait confiance.
Il s'agit de... Tom !
Voyons. Vous me devez bien ça.
Oui, d'accord.
Je n'essayais pas de me noyer.
Je ne sais même pas si j'aurais pu.
Ok.
Isabelle, je pensais seulement qu'après
tout ce qui est arrivé avec Lily...
Shawn...
Cela n'a rien à voir avec ma mère.
J'apprenais toute seule à nager.
Toute habillée ?
Ben, je n'ai jamais porté de maillot de bain avant.
Je ne savais pas quoi mettre.
Et je suis trop âgé pour demander de l'aide.
C'est embarrassant de ne pas savoir nager.
Tout le monde doit apprendre un jour,
Isabelle.
J'ai appris quand j'étais enfant.
Mais je n'ai jamais été une enfant.
Voilà pourquoi je n'ai jamais appris à nager,
ou à conduire,
Ou même sortir avec quelqu'un.
Je n'arrête pas de lire plein de choses
au sujet de ces... parcours initiatiques.
Le genre d'événements que les gens
traversent afin de devenir adulte ?
- Oui.
- Oui. Mais je suis une adulte...
et j'ai raté tout le reste.
Ce n'est pas juste.
Je dois me rattraper. Alors j'ai fait une liste.
Une liste ? Quelle organisation !
Et bien, Isabelle. Il y a une piscine au centre.
Je pourrais probablement t'enseigner
les bases.
Vraiment ?
Merci, Shawn.
Papa ?
Quel âge avais-tu lorsque tu as appris à nager ?
Environ 11 ans je crois.
Pourquoi ? Tu veux que je t'apprenne ?
C'est bon. Shawn a dit qu'il le ferait.
Ah, il a dit ça ?
Et bien, assure-toi qu'il ne te jette pas
tout de suite dans le grand bain.
C'est comme ça que ma grand-mère a fait pour moi.
Ecoute, Isabelle...
Je serais absent cette nuit. Si tu as besoin
de quoique ce soit. Demande à Shawn.
Où vas-tu ?
Je vais ramener ta mère à la maison.
Qu'elle puisse reposer en paix.
Je peux venir avec toi ?
Je ne crois pas.
J'y vais en avion et...
A vrai dire, je ne crois pas que tu sois encore prête
à t'éloigner du Centre pour l'instant.
Tu veux être seul avec elle
pour lui dire "Adieu", c'est ça ?
Oui, je pense que oui.
- Tom.
- Mon dieu !
Tu m'as fait une de ces peurs, Diana.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Pourquoi ton arme est elle sortie ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Jarvis est en route.
Tout le monde est avec elle. Tu dois venir.
De quoi tu parles ?
Tu as tué T.J Kim ce matin.
- Quoi ?
- Tu ne t'en souviens pas ?
Me souvenir ? Je n'ai tué personne.
J'étais ici toute la matinée.
Quelqu'un peut confirmer ça ?
Non. Non.
J'étais supposé avoir un appel en conférence
mais ils l'ont annulée.
Ecoute, j'ai pris une demi-journée de congé, Diana.
Je suis allé courir. Je n'étais pas au travail.
Tu dois arrêter de dire ça,
parce que deux douzaines de personnes t'ont vu.
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il se passe.
Peut-être es tu amnésique, comme Kyle.
C'est peut-être autre chose.
C'est peut-être une capacité de 4400.
Je veux dire, je ne sais pas, mais...
Tu dois venir.
Et qu'est-ce qui m'arrive si je viens ?
Je suis arrêté pour meurtre ?
Tu sais, on va trouver une solution, ok ?
Tout le monde veut t'aider.
Tu dois...Tu dois juste venir.
Tu permets que je m'habille d'abord ?
Bien sûr.
Es-tu certain de te souvenir de
tout ce que tu as fait ce matin ?
Pas d'absence ou autre chose ?
Tu n'as pas fait un somme ?
Tom ?
Tom ?
Bon sang !
Hé, salut. C'est moi. Il est parti.
Je-je ne sais pas comment.
Ils n'ont envoyé qu'un agent après lui.
Ecoute, désolé. Il est parti.
Quoi ?
Pas question. C'est un agent du NTAC.
Ils vont s'y attendre.
Ok.
Vous avez raison. Il en sera ainsi. Je le ferai.
Je l'ai laissé s'habiller.
Je ne pensais qu'il sauterait
d’une fenêtre du deuxième étage.
Bien, apparemment, vous avez sous-estimé
la détermination de votre équipier.
Est-ce qu'il vous paraît encore innocent ?
Je ne sais pas. Ecoutez,
C'était vraiment une mauvaise visite,
et j'en prends l'entière responsabilité.
J'ai alerté les forces de l'ordre, le FBI.
Je leur ai dit que Tom était recherché pour
être interrogé au sujet d'un meurtre.
C'est un fugitif maintenant.
Oh, ne me regardez pas comme ça, Diana.
Je n'ai eu pas le choix.
Désolé.
- C'est Tom.
- Oui.
Tom ?
Je suis désolé de t'avoir faussé compagnie.
Où es-tu ?
- Je n'ai pas tué Kim. Je n'ai tué personne.
Je te crois. Mais tu dois venir, et nous
pourrons essayer de comprendre ce qu'il se passe.
Non, je n'irai pas en prison.
Personne ne va te jeter en prison.
Ils l'ont fait à mon fils, Diana.
C'était vraiment lui qui a pressé la
détente le jour où Jordan Collier est mort ?
Non, c'était pas lui, c'était pas lui.
Il est incarcéré. Ce n'était pas lui mais
il est incarcéré.
Tu es un fugitif, Tom.
Tout le département de police de
Washington te recherche.
Si un flic qui veut jouer les héros te repère,
tu sais comment ça peut finir.
Je dois prouver que je n'y suis
pour rien.
Ecoute, fouille, Diana. Il doit y avoir des
preuves qui m'innocenteront.
Aide-moi juste à les trouver.
Il t'a donné sa position ?
Marco, aide-moi à m'en sortir.
Si tu essayais de prouver que
ton équipier n'a pas commis un crime
Et que le monde entier pense que
c'est lui le coupable...
Par où tu commencerais ?
Eh bien, je pense que je commencerais par supposer
que mon équipier n'était pas impliqué.
Ok, penses-y comme à un autre dossier.
Quelle est la première chose que tu ferais au départ ?
Eh bien, reconnaître les faits.
Je veux dire, il y a un cadavre,
il y a l'arme que Tom a laissée,
Et il y a une quantité de personnes
qui l'ont vu sur les lieux.
Ils ont des caméras de sécurité
dans la salle de détention, non ?
Vous êtes sérieux ?
Vous me demandez vraiment tous ces enregistrements ?
Bien sûr que je suis sérieuse.
Ca pose un problème ?
Bien, c'est juste que...
Je lui ai donné toutes les cassettes,
il y a environ une heure.
De quoi tu parles ?
Je ne suis pas monté de toute la journée.
Qu'est-ce que c'est, une blague ?
Marco, voyons !
Tu étais juste là. Tu as signé pour tous les
enregistrements de la salle de détention.
Ce n'est pas si difficile.
C'est parce que je n'ai pas encore lâché.
Bon...Je vais déplacer mes mains.
Es-tu prête ?
Non, pas encore. Je suis à l'aise.
Tu es à l'aise ?
Je gèle.
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il se passe.
Cette piscine est supposée être chauffée.
- Tu veux que je réchauffe ça ?
- Tu peux le faire ?
Je pense. Attends.
Comment as-tu fait ça ?
Je ne sais pas. Comment tu soignes toi ?
Ce n'est pas pareil, Isabelle.
Soigner est une chose.
C'est ce que nous pouvons touts faire: une chose.
Pas moi. Je pense que je suis différente.
Shawn.
Désolé de faire irruption.
Nous sommes attendus au conseil d'administration.
- Ca commence maintenant ?
- Il y a déjà 5 minutes.
Ils attendent.
Psst.
Alana.
Thomas. Que fais-tu ici ?
J'ai des ennuis.
Mes patrons au NTAC, ils pensent que j'ai fait quelque chose.
J'ai besoin que tu viennes avec moi.
- De quoi parles ...
- Pas le temps de t'expliquer.
Thomas !
- Salut ?
- Alana, je suis juste en bas de la rue.
J'ai besoin que tu viennes à ma rencontre.
Chérie. J'ai des problèmes.
Tout le monde pense que j'ai tué quelqu'un.
Qui est-ce ? Je sais que ce n'est pas Thomas.
De quoi tu parles ?
Thomas est en face de moi en ce moment-même.
Chérie, écoute, ce n'est pas moi.
L'homme que tu regardes, il peut se faire
passer pour moi je ne sais comment.
Je ne vous crois pas.
Il est entré au NTAC et
a tué quelqu'un ce matin.
Alana, il est dangereux. Eloigne-toi de lui.
Alana, écoute-moi.
Le deuxième prénom de ta mère est Madeleine..
Tu voulais un chien quand tu étais gamine,
Mais à la place tes parents t'ont donné un oiseau,
un perroquet nommé Charlie.
Ecoute, nous avons fait l'amour la nuit dernière.
Il y avait 2 bougies qui brûlaient.
Attends. J'arrive tout de suite.
Est-ce que j'avais un chien quand j'étais petite ?
Je n'ai pas le temps pour ça.
- Qu'est-ce qui te prend ?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Tom ?
- Tu vas bien ?
- Oui.
- Où est-il ?
- Il vient de s'enfuir par derrière.
Hé !
Avez-vous vu un gars descendre cette ruelle ?
Il me ressemblait trait pour trait.
- Je n'ai vu personne.
- Vous êtes sûr ?
Il est parti.
Il est parti.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Il vient juste de sortir il y a quelques secondes.
Il n'y avait personne. Seulement un gamin.
C'était lui.
Je l'avais.
C'était lui. Je l'avais !
Tu avais qui ? De quel gamin parles-tu ?
Celui qui se fait passer pour moi..
Le gars qui veut me faire endosser le meurtre.
Il te ressemblait. Il avait la même voix.
Il se tenait aussi prêt que tu l'es maintenant,
et il m'a complètement bernée.
Ne te blâme pas. Il a berné tout le NTAC aussi.
Au moins on sait ce qu'il se passe maintenant.
C'est un 4400, n'est-ce pas ?
D'une certaine manière,
il peut se faire passer pour toi.
Ouais. Je ne suis pas sûr de savoir comment.
Je veux dire, peut-être qu'il a une
sorte de camouflage optique.
Il peut convaincre ton cerveau que tu es en train de parler
à la personne qu'il veut que tu vois.
C'est un garçon. Pourquoi voudrait-il tuer quelqu'un ?
Pas n'importe qui.
T.J. Kim, le premier membre du groupe
Nova que nous avions attrapés.
Je veux dire, réfléchis, c'est un bon plan.
Tu te débarrasses de l'un des membres
de ta cellule qui peut témoigner contre toi,
Tu compromets un agent gouvernemental, et le NTAC,
La seule agence qui essaye de te retrouver,
Perd son temps en poursuivant l'un des siens.
Alana.
Tu devrais peut-être rentrer.
Il y a des gens avec toutes sortes d'insignes partout.
Ils ont dit qu'ils étaient des agents de la NTAC.
Ecoutes, fait-les patienter.
Je veux que tu rentres à la maison.
Je veux que tu fermes la porte à double tour,
Et que tu ne l'ouvres pas jusqu'à ce que
tout soit tiré au clair.
Si j'ai besoin de te joindre...
J'utiliserai un code.
Que penses-tu de "Mort à Venise" ?
Ton livre préféré. C'est un bon choix.
Ecoutes, Shawn, merci de m'avoir laisser venir ici.
Je sais que tu peux avoir des problèmes.
C'est juste que je ne savais pas où aller.
- Vous devez avoir une base de données sur les 4400 ici, pas vrai ?
- Ouais.
J'ai besoin d'y jeter un oeil.
- Je veux trouver ce qu'est ce gamin.
- Je peux le transférer sur mon portable.
Ca peut prendre du temps.
Ca te gène si je me mets à l'aise ?
Non, c'est bon.
Ca y est.
Tu sais, oncle Tommy,
tu peux rester ici si tu veux.
Il se pourrait que j'accepte ton offre.
Très bien...
Mais hé, tu prends le canapé.
Ok...
Les reins, hein ?
Cela explique le sang dans l'urine.
Kevin, on avait un marché.
Je vous aidais tant que cela
ne mettait pas votre santé en danger.
Bien, devinez quoi...
J'appelle l'hôpital.
Mais ils ne me laisseront pas prendre mes piqûres
Oh, non.
C'est fini avec vos piqûres.
Je sais qu'on avait un arrangement,
et je le respecterai.
Laissez-moi juste vous montrer
quelque chose avant que vous appeliez.
Qu'est-il arrivé à vos ongles ?
Uh, ils sont tombés.
Dissous, je dirais.
Si vous essayez de me faire changer d'avis,
vous ne faites pas un très bon...
Kevin...Bon sang qu'est-ce que vous venez de faire ?
Kevin, vous avez développé un don de 4400.
Ca vient.
- Ca ne marche pas tout le temps.
- Le scalpel est passé à travers de votre main.
Je sais, j'étais inquiet à ce sujet.
C'est cool de conduire vite.
Ouais.
Toutes ces informations
à propos des taux de compression
Et de rapports de vitesse
n'ont complètement rien à voir.
Bien, tu ne nous ramènes pas à la maison.
Descends de là.
Tu as de la chance de ne pas avoir
accrocher ma voiture avec un poteau.
Est-ce qu'il y a quelque chose
sur ta liste qui implique
Tu sais, un peu moins de risque de se faire mal ?
On peut faire l'amour.
Allez. Tu as un grand lit.
Whoa, Isabelle, hé...
Euh, non.
Pourquoi ? C'est sur ma liste.
C'est un rite important dans le passage à l'âge adulte.
Ce sera cool. J'étais bonne pour la conduite.
Je suis certain que tu appendrais vite.
Euh. Je ne sais pas.
D'abord, ton père me tuerait.
Pourquoi ? Je suis une adulte.
Bien, tu l'es et tu ne l'es pas, Isabelle.
Disons qu'il a le droit
d'avoir une opinion sur la question.
Je ne sais pas, isabelle.
J'ai l'impression que je profiterais de toi.
Mais je veux le faire.
Bien, je suis flatté. Vraiment.
Mais je ne pense pas que tu sois prête pour
prendre cette décision.
On se connaît à peine.
Je te connais mieux que personne.
C'est peut-être vrai.
Mais ça n'arrivera pas.
Les leçons avec Isabelle se passent bien ?
Ce ne sont pas des leçons,
et c'est complètement innocent.
Fais-moi une faveur.
Ne me pose plus de question à ce sujet.
- C'est Skouris.
- Son nom est Boyd Gelder, Diana.
C'est un 4400. Je sais où il vit.
Qui vit où ? Qui est Boyd Gelder ?
Le gosse qui fait ça.
Il peut m'imiter par je ne sais quel moyen.
Et pas seulement m'imiter.
Il peut être moi.
Ou du moins vous faire croire que c'est moi.
Il vit avec sa mère.
Je suis au parc Schenley. C'est juste à côté de sa maison.
Bien, tu peux m'attendre ?
J'y serais dans 15 minutes.
J'attendrais...mais Diana, seulement toi.
Que moi.
On vient juste d'arriver. Où vas-tu ?
Au parc Schenley. Je pense que l'on
peut faire une pause sur l'affaire de tom.
Tom !
Tom !
Je n’en ai parlé à personne, Thomas.
Sauf à Marco.
Du moins, je pensais que c'était Marco.
Je regardais à travers le parc.
Tu étais là.
Mais c'était toi, enfin ce n’était pas toi.
Dis-moi en plus. En réalité, tu poursuivais dans le parc
celui qui s'est changé en toi.
Je veux dire, je ne cours pas
vraiment comme ça, n'est-ce pas ?
C'est un don incroyable.
Marco va s'en donner à coeur joie.
Bien. Mets-le au travail.
On va avoir besoin de trouver
un moyen de mettre la main sur ce gars.
Attends, attends, attends. Non,
tu n’as plus besoin de te cacher maintenant.
Tu peux rentrer avec moi maintenant.
Je suis encore recherché pour meurtre, Diana.
Non, tu ne l'es plus.
Boyd s'est fait passer pour toi. Il a tiré sur T.J.
Kim. Tu n'es pas responsable.
Ecoutes, je viens de voir son don de mes propres yeux.
C'est bien la preuve de quelque chose.
Je te soutiendrais dans tout ce que tu diras.
Ce qui signifie exactement rien.
Je veux dire, merci, Diana,
mais tu es mon partenaire.
Tout le monde s'attend à ce que tu me défendes.
Il n'y a qu'un seul moyen pour
prouver que je n'ai pas tué T.J. Kim.
- Je dois attraper Boyd Gelder.
- Ok, c'est parti.
Tu es sûre de vouloir venir ?
Je suis ta partenaire.
Tout le monde s'attend à ce que je te défende.
Je devrais être de retour dès ce soir.
J'ai...
Pris mon temps, j'ai fait une halte
à tous les endroits qu'aimait ta mère.
Tout va bien ? Tu es allée à tous
tes rendez-vous chez le médecin ?
La plupart d'entre eux.
C'est important.
On doit continuer à te surveiller.
Je vais bien.
Shawn prend bien soin de moi, comme tu l'as demandé.
Il fait un bon travail.
- Ah, ouais ?
- Ouais.
Il m'a appris à nager sur le dos,
il m'a laissé conduire sa voiture...
Et puis je lui ai demandé de faire l'amour avec moi,
mais il a dit non.
Il a dit que tu serais en colère. C'est vrai ?
Isabelle...
Tu es trop jeune pour penser à...
- Ca.
- Ah bon ?
Mais je pensais que j'avais presque 20 ans.
Quel âge avais-tu quand tu as perdu ta virginité ?
C'était...
Les choses étaient différentes à mon époque.
Ce n'est pas la même chose.
Ah bon ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu sais quoi, Isabelle ?
Je ne veux pas avoir cette conversation
avec toi au téléphone.
Donc Shawn avait raison. Tu es furieux.
Je ne comprends pas.
Mais pourquoi le NTAC veut parler à
mon fils ?
Il a des ennuis. On ne peut pas en parler.
On veut juste lui parler.
Eh bien, il n'est pas là.
Il est parti au ski avec des amis,
et il ne sera de retour que demain.
Madame...
Votre fils n'est pas parti au ski, et c'est sérieux.
Il n'y a aucun moyen de le contacter ?
Dites-moi d'abords ce qui se passe.
Qu'est-ce que mon fils a fait ?
Mrs. Gelder, il y a beaucoup d'agents
qui recherchent votre fils.
Des situations pareilles peuvent dégénérées.
Des personnes peuvent être blessées.
Plus vite nous le retrouverons, plus vite il sera en sécurité.
Alors pourquoi vous ne l'appelez pas
et persuadez le que vous devez le voir.
Boyd est en retard.
Je me demande même s'il va venir.
Laisse-lui encore quelques minutes.
Une mère géniale, une maison magnifique...
Ce qui me fait penser...
Si le groupe Nova peut engrainer ce gosse,
Qui d'autre ont-ils déjà entraîné ?
Tout le monde dit que les 4400
sont là pour sauver le monde.
- Peu importe ce que ça coûte.
- Exactement.
Enfin, dit ce que tu veux au sujet de Nova.
Mais ils semblent avoir un stratagème.
Je suis sûre qu'ils cachent quelque chose.
Ben, je me trompe peut-être,
mais je ne pense pas que ce soit Boyd.
Qu'est-ce que le NTAC vient donc faire ici ?
Peut-être que Boyd a découvert que
c'était un piège et les a averti.
- Thomas.
- Alana, ouvre.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Il y a des agents du NTAC qui surveillent la maison.
Ils viennent de partir. Ils doivent changer d'équipe.
Allez, laisse-moi entrer.
"Mort à Venise", ok ? Ouvre.
Je ne veux pas qu'on me voit ici.
Allez.
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait de tes clés ?
Je les ai perdu. J'ai dû les perdre pendant que je fuyais.
Allez. C'est moi, Tom, Alana.
Je t'ai donné le code.
Pitié, ne m'y oblige pas.
Je n'ai rien contre toi.
Tom... C'est de chez toi.
Alana ?
Je viens juste d'écrire une lettre sur ton ordinateur.
Tu dois venir la signer.
- Boyd ?
- C'est une confession.
Ca dit que tu as craqué à cause de la pression
due aux charges retenues contre ton fils.
Tu as tiré sur T.J, et maintenant tu ne peux pas vivre avec ça,
donc tu as décidé de te suicider.
Où est Alana ? Qu'est-ce que tu lui as fait ?
C'est ma porte de sortie.
Tu vois, tu es le seul
qui pourrait m'identifier.
Pour les autres, ils voient juste en double.
Ils ont l'impression de devenir fou.
Je ne vais pas signer la lettre de suicide Boyd,
Passe-moi Alana.
Oh, tu vas la signer, car soit je te tue...
Ou soit je la tue elle.
C'est un marché.
Ta vie contre la sienne.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je ne crois pas que je vais te laisser faire, Tom.
On doit appeler Jarvis. On doit bloquer toute la rue.
On doit encercler ta maison.
Il détient Alana.
Tom, il veut te tuer. Le moindre qu'on puisse faire
c'est de lui rendre ça un peu plus difficile.
Si c'était Maia là-bas...Tu appellerais Jarvis ?
Tu l’aimes ?
Pourquoi tu m'as ramené ça ?
Tu es une jeune femme. Une jeune femme
devrait toujours avoir une jolie robe.
Ca te va super bien.
Regarde par toi-même.
Merci.
Je vois que tu passes beaucoup de temps avec Shawn.
Alors ?
Je pense que c'est magnifique.
Shawn est un vrai solitaire.
Il ne passe pas beaucoup de temps avec
des gens de son âge.
Je crois...que tu devrais te rapprocher de lui
autant que tu le peux.
Matthew ?
Shawn est gentil.
Ce que je fais avec lui n'est pas pour toi,
et ce n'est pas parce que j'essaye de profiter de lui.
Bien sûr que non...
Mais par la suite, Isabelle,
Toi et Shawn n'allez pas être d'accord sur certains points
idéologiques,
Alors...Profite bien de ton amitié...
Mais ne laisse pas tes émotions prendre le dessus.
Ca rendra les choses plus difficiles plus tard.
Quelles choses ?
Tu verras.
Ca ne va pas avec la couleur de tes yeux.
Tu devrais y remédier.
Vous étiez de merveilleuses femmes.
Toutes les deux.
Vous étiez exactement pareilles.
Je ne saurai jamais pourquoi.
D'une certaine manière, j'ai eu une Lily
dans ma vie pendant 50 ans.
Vous avez toutes disparu maintenant...
Et je ne sais pas ce que je vais faire...
Mais, euh...
Ca me rassure de savoir que toutes les deux
êtes ensemble...
Pour l'éternité.
C'est fini pour toi tu sais.
Je ne sais pas quel genre de mensonges
le groupe Nova t'a raconté,
Mais ça na pas d'importance
ce qui peut arriver à moi, ou Tom.
Ta vie est finie.
Tu t'es engagé dans une mission suicide.
Je me suis proposé, et je ne crois pas
que vous êtes en position de me donner des conseils.
Vous êtes un 4400.
Vous êtes spécial.
Vous êtes censé changer les choses.
Vivre avec un agent du NTAC.
Et qu'est-ce que vous allez changer, Boyd ?
Vous avez tué une fille.
Est-ce que ça va rendre le monde meilleur ?
T.J. Kim était un soldat.
Elle aurait préférée que je lui mette une balle dans la tête
que de nous trahir.
Tout le monde parle de changer le monde.
Mais ces 50 dernières années,
Tout s'est empiré,
une catastrophe après l'autre...
Mais nous allons montrer au monde une autre voie.
Nous allons les diriger vers un nouveau chemin...
De force si nous y sommes obligés.
Pourquoi ne voyez-vous pas que la réelle catastrophe
est de rester assis là et de ne rien faire ?
Vous avez entendu ça ?
Arrêtez !
Arrêtez, tous les deux ! Arrêtez, ou je tire.
Beau travail, Alana. Nous l'avons. La ferme !
Alana, "Mort à Venise".
Ouais, c'est le code.
Allez, Alana. Donne-moi le révolver.
On va appeler le NTAC. C'est fini.
Alana, c'est moi, Tom.
Pose moi une question. Quoi que ce soit.
Ne te fais pas avoir.
Il a probablement lu mon dossier. Il sait tous sur nous.
Ne l'écoute pas.
Pose-moi une question sur nous.
Quelque chose que seulement moi je sais.
Quelque chose sur nous.
Fermez-la, tous les deux.
Bébé...
Je suis tellement fier de toi.
Bill aurait été aussi si fier.
Tu sais pour Billy ?
- Ouais.
- C'était ton fils.
Il est mort dans un accident de voiture.
Alena, il a fait des recherches.
Tout le monde pourrait le découvrir.
Donne-moi le révolver. Donne-moi..
Donne-moi le révolver.
Alana, donne-moi le révolver.
Non. Alana...
Donne-moi le révolver.
A genoux !
Quoi ?
Non, tu te trompes de personnes.
Réfléchis.
J'ai dit "A genoux".
Ne bouges plus.
Tu n’es qu'un gosse.
Je suis un soldat.
Et nous sommes de plus en plus nombreux chaque jour.
Allons-y, Soldat.
Bon retour parmi nous.
Ouais, merci. Tout se passe bien ?
Ouais, merci, et merci de garder
un oeil sur Isabelle.
Oh, ben, ce n'est pas un problème.
Je n'ai pas fait grand chose.
Ouais, ben, merci en tout cas.
Je m'inquiète pour elle.
Tu ne devrais pas.
Elle semble se débrouiller de mieux en mieux.
Je suis son père. C'est mon devoir.
Et c'est bien plus difficile avec Isabelle.
Les gens la regardent, ils voient une femme
Une femme magnifique...
Mais ils oublient peut-être que à l'intérieur d'elle,
c'est encore une jeune fille.
Si n'est que...
Je suis heureux qu'elle t'ait..
En tant qu'ami.
Shawn.
Comment t'es entré ?
Je peux faire des trucs, tu te rappelles ?
Ouais.
Alors, comment ça va ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Juste une chose.
C'est sur ma liste.
Un premier baiser.
Ce n’est pas bien, Isabelle.
Ok.

Over the last 60 years 4400
people have been abducted
All at once they were returned
With no memory of where they've been
They haven't aged a day
And some have returned with new abilities
All are trying to reconnect...
...with a life interrupted
(Č±Ň»ľä)
Previously on the 4400...
lily,are you all right?
- Where's my wife?
- What are you talking about?
Mr. Tyler,when your wife fainted this morning,
she was a young woman.
When she woke up less than a minute later,
she was 50 years older.
Are you my mother?
(Č±Ň»ľä)
I understand there was an incident this morning.
You attempted to harm yourself.
You had no right to do that!
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin,
and then I will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.
That was T.J. Kim running from the courthouse.
When she hit this place,T.J. Drove every man
in the building into a homicidal rage.
Ever since we took them off the inhibitor,
they're either developing new abilities or
they're refining the ones that they've got.
(Č±Ň»ľä)1
(Č±Ň»ľä)2
You sold us out.
I don't guess we'll be seeing
her in court any time soon.
This is a message from the nova group.
We are the defensive wing of the 4400.
Today,the world has seen what happens to
those who try to harm us.A new era dawns.
Hi.
Need your auxiliary rounds as well,
agent baldwin.
Oh,yeah.
Of course.I forgot,ian.Thanks.
- You can go in.
- Great.
Hi,T.J.
What do you want?
Dr. Burkhoff?
I have your prescriptions.
Hello?
Say something if you're here.
Don'T.
Please.
I've been having migraines.
How severe?
Bad enough.
Don't worry.They're just headaches.
I've been getting them for years.
7:45.
You're just in time for my wake-up call.
(Ç°Ăć»ąÓĐ)How many a day are you up to now?
Six.
You've doubled your dosage?
I thought you weren't going to do that
we're talking now.
Look,I'm training my body to
produce a new neurotransmitter.
And I guarantee you i'm not the only one trying.
The moment the first 4400 manifested an ability,
an arms race began.
Someone is going to produce a promicin serum
that will cause non-4400s to develop
extraordinary abilities.It will happen.
The only questions are who's going
to do it and who's going to control it?
Hopefully someone with a highly
developed sense of responsibility...
and some judgment.
Let me ask you--
in your day-to-day affairs?
Do a lot of them hold
high-ranking government posts
or sit on the board of
giant pharmaceutical companies?
Dr. Burkhoff...
I knew that you had some...
personality quirks,
but I never pegged you for a cynic.
I can't afford to have a charitable view
of human nature.There's too much at stake here.
If these experiments cost me
some headaches...some sores...
I'd say that's a price worth paying.
Wouldn't you?
I'm here,right?
Holy mother--
why are we doing this?
Everything I'm telling you,
it's all in my file.You know it already.
Relax,T.J.
I just think it's important we review
everything you've told the government so far.
Have we?
Yes.
(Ç°Ăć»ąÓĐ)That's everything I know.
Okay.
Thanks for your cooperation.
We're just trying to consolidate information.
You'd be amazed how hard that can be in a bureaucracy.
Yeah,well...
I hope you don't expect me to say "you're welcome."
What are you doing?
What,this?
It's nothing.(şóĂć»ąÓĐ)

Season 03 Episode 03</font>
Get geared up.We're leaving in two minutes.
What for?What's going on?
Your partner registered to
see T.J. Kim this morning.
When tom left the interview room,
T.J. Was dead.
- What?
- Two gunshot wounds to the head.
Apparently,tom snuck a small firearm
into the interrogation room.
By the time the guard went into the room and
found T.J.'S body,tom had already left the building.
- We're going to pick him up right now.
- Wait,wait.
This is tom we're talking about here.
There's got to be some explanation.
Maybe T.J. Used her ability on him.
No,she had concentrated promicin
inhibitor pumping through her veins.
We've tried to contact tom,
but he hasn't been picking up his phone.
We need to get him in here
just let me talk to him first.
He trusts me.
Now,this is tom.
Come on.We owe him that much.
Yeah,okay.
I wasn't trying to drown myself.
I don't even know if I could.
Okay.
Isabelle,I just thought that after
everything that happened with lily--
shawn...
this has nothing to do with my mother.
I was teaching myself to swim.
In your clothes?
Well,I never wore a bathing suit before.
I didn't know what to get.
And I'm too old to ask for help.
It's embarrassing not knowing how to swim.
Everybody's got to learn sometime,isabelle.
I learned when I was a kid.
But I never was a kid.
That's why I never learned how to swim,
or how to drive,or ever went out on a date.
I keep reading about all these...
rites of passage.
Like stuff everyone goes
through before they grow up?
Yeah.Yeah,but I am grown up...
and I missed out on all of it.
It's not fair.
I've got to catch up,
so I made a list.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
Well,isabelle,
there's a pool at the center.
I could probably teach you the basics.
Really?
Thanks,shawn.
Dad?
How old were you when you learned how to swim?
(Č±Ň»ľä)
You want me to teach you?
Shawn said he'd do it.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
Well,just make sure he doesn't
throw you in the deep end right away.
That's what my grandmother did to me.
Look,isabelle...
I'm going to be gone overnight.
If you need anything,see shawn.
Where are you going?
I'm going to take your mother home.
I'm putting her to rest.
Well,can I come with you?
I don't think so.
I'm flying,and...
I don't think you're ready to
be away from the center yet.
You want to be alone with her
when you say goodbye,don't you?
Yeah,I guess I do.
- Tom.
- God!
You scared the hell out of me,diana.
What are you doing here?
Why is your gun out?
What the hell is going on?
Jarvis is on her way over.
She's got everyone with her.You need to come in.
What are you talking about?
You shot T.J. Kim this morning.
- What?
- You don't remember?
Don't remember?I didn't shoot anybody.
I've been here all morning.
Can someone confirm that?
No.No.I was supposed to have a
conference call they canceled,though.
Look,I took a half a personal day,
diana.I went jogging.I wasn't at work.
You got to stop saying that,
because two dozen people saw you there.
Now,I don't know what's going on.
Maybe you're blacking out,like kyle did.
Maybe it's something else.
Maybe it's like some 4400 ability.
I mean,I don't know,but...
(Č±Ň»ľä)1
and what happens if I do?
I get arrested for murder?
You know,we'll figure it out,okay?
Everyone wants to help you.
You just--you just have to come in.
You mind if I get dressed first?
Sure.
Are you sure you remember
everything you did this morning?
There's no time gaps or anything?
You didn't take a nap?
Tom?
Tom??
Damn it.
Yeah,hi. It's me.He got away.
I-I don't know how.
They only sent one agent after him.
Look,sorry.He got away.
What?
No way. He's an ntac agent.
They'll be expecting that.
Okay.
You're right.This has to happen.I'll do it.
I was letting him get dressed.
I didn't think he would jump
from a second story window.
Well,obviously,you underestimated
your partner's resolve.
Does he still seem blameless to you?
I don't know.Look,
it was a really bad call,
and I take full responsibility.
I've alerted local law enforcement,the fbi.
I've told them that tom is wanted for
questioning in connection with a murder.
He's a fugitive now.
Oh,don't give me that look,diana.
I had no choice.
Sorry.
- It's tom.
- Yeah.
Tom?
I'm sorry I ran out on you.
Where are you?
- (Č±Ň»ľä)
I believe you.But you have to come in,
and we can figure out what's going on.
No,I'm not going to jail.
No one's going to put you in prison.
They did it to my son,diana.
Was it really him that pulled the
trigger the day jordan collier died?
He's incarcerated.(Č±Ň»ľä)
You're a fugitive,tom.
Every police department in
washington is looking for you.
Some local cop wants to be a hero,spots you,
you know how these things can end.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
Look,dig around,diana.There's got
to be some evidence that will clear me.
Just...help me find it.
Did he give you a location?
Marco,help me out here.
If you were trying to prove that your partner didn't
commit a crime that the whole world thinks he did...
where would you start?
Well,I guess I'd start by pretending
that my partner wasn't involved.
Okay,just think of it like any other case.
What's the first thing you do when you start?
Well,look at the evidence.
I mean,there's a dead body,
there's the gun that tom left behind,
and there's a bunch of
people that saw him here.
Well,they've got security cameras
down in the detention ward,right?
You're serious?You're really
asking me for all that footage?
Of course I'm serious.
Is that a problem?
Well,it's just...
I gave all the tapes to him,
like an hour ago.
what are you talking about?
I haven't been up here all day.
What is this,a joke?
Marco,come on.
You were just here.You signed for
all the footage from the detention ward.
This isn't so hard.
That's because i haven't let go yet.
All right...I'm going to move my hands.
Are you ready?
No,not yet.I'm kind of comfortable.
You're kind of comfortable?
I'm freezing.
I don't know what's going on.
This pool's supposed to be heated.
- Want me to make it warmer?
- You can do that?
I think so. Hold on.
How did you do that?
I don't know.How do you heal?
It's not the same,isabelle.
Healing's one thing.
That's what we can all do--one thing.
Not me.I guess I'm different.
Shawn.
Sorry to barge in.
We're scheduled to brief the board of directors.
- That's starting now?
- Five minutes ago.
They're on hold.
Psst.
Alana.
What are you doing here?
I'm in trouble.
My bosses at ntac,
they think i did something.
I need you to come with me.
- What are you talking--
- I don't have time to explain.
Thomas!
- Hello?
- Alana,I'm right down the street.
I need you to come meet me.
Honey,I'm in trouble.
Everyone thinks I killed somebody.
Who is this?I know it's not thomas.
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at thomas right now.
Honey,listen,that's not me.
The man you're looking at,
he can impersonate me somehow.
I don't believe you.
He walked into ntac and
he shot someone this morning.
Alana,he's dangerous.Get away from him.
Alana,listen to me.
Your mother's middle name is madeleine.
You wanted a dog when you were a kid,
but your parents gave you a bird instead,
a parakeet named charlie.
Listen,we made love last night.
There were two candles burning.
Just hold on.I'll be right there.
Did I have a dog when I was a girl?
I don't have time for this.
- What are you doing?
- What's going on,tom?
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Where is he?
- He just ran through the back.
Hey!
Did you see a guy come down this alley?
He looked exactly like me.
- I didn't see anybody.
- (Č±Ň»ľä)
He's gone.
He's gone.
What do you mean?
He just ran out a few seconds ago.
There was no one here.Just some kid.
It was him.
It had to be.I had him.
Had who?What kid are you talking about?
The one who's impersonating me.
The guy who's framing me for murder.
He looked like you.He sounded like you.
He was standing as close as you are right now,
and he had me completely fooled.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
At least we know what's going on now.
He's a 4400,isn't he?
Somehow he can pass himself off as you.
Yeah. I'm not sure how.
I mean,maybe he's got some
kind of optical camouflage.
He can convince your brain you're
talking to whoever he wants you to see.
He's a boy.Why would he want to kill anyone?
Not just anybody.
T.J. Kim,I mean,think about it.
You get rid of the one member of
your cell who could testify against you,
you compromise a government agent,and ntac,
the one agency that's trying to hunt you down,
is wasting their time chasing one of their own.
Alana.
You might want to get in here.
There's all kinds of people
flashing badges everywhere.
They said they're ntac agents.
Look,stall them.I want you to go home.
I want you to lock the doors,
and don't open it until this is all cleared up.
If I need to get ahold of you...
I'll use a password.
How about "death in venice"?
Your favorite book.That's a good choice.
Listen,shawn,thanks for letting me come in here.
I just didn't know where else to go.
Look,you guys must have
a database of 4400s here,right?
I need to get a look at it,here.
I can pull it up on my laptop for you.
This might take a while.
You mind if I let myself out?
There you go.
You know,uncle tommy,
you can stay here if you want.
I might take you up on it.
All right...
but hey,you get the couch.
Okay...
kidneys,huh?
That explains the blood in the urine.
Kevin,we had a deal.
I was going to help you through this as
long as it wasn't compromising your health.
Well,guess what--
I'm calling the hospital.
But they won't let me take my shots.
Oh,no.
You're done with your shots.
I know we had an agreement,
and I'll honor it.
Just let me show you something before you call.
What happened to your fingernails?
Uh,they fell off.
Dissolved,I guess you'd say.
If you're trying to change my mind,
you're not doing a very good--
Kevin...what the hell did you just do?
Kevin,you've developed a 4400 ability.
It's getting there.
Doesn't always work?
I was nervous about that.
It's fun to drive fast.
Yeah.
All that information
about compression rates
and gear ratios just
seems completely irrelevant.
Well,you're not driving home.
Get out of there.
You're lucky you didn't
wrap my car around a pole.
Is there anything on this list
of yours that involves,you know,
a little less risk of bodily harm?
We could have sex.
Come on.You have a big bed.
Whoa,isabelle,hey...
uh,no.
Why? It's on my list.
It's an important rite of passage into adulthood.
It'll be fun.I was good at driving.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
I don't know.
For one thing,your dad would kill me.
Why?I'm an adult.
Well,you are and you aren'T.
Let's just say he has a right to
have an opinion on the matter.
I don't know,isabelle.I feel like
I'd be taking advantage of you.
But I want to.
Well,I'm flattered.I really am.
But I just don't think you're ready to
make that decision.We barely know each other.
I know you better than I
know anyone else in the world.
That may be true.
It's still not going to happen.
Lessons with isabelle going well?
They're not lessons,
and it's completely innocent.
Do me a favor and don't ask about them again.
- This is skouris.
- His name's boyd gelder,diana.
He's a 4400.I know where he lives.
Where who lives?Who's boyd gelder?
The kid who's doing this.
And not just imitate.
He can be me.
At least make you think he's me.
He lives with his mom.
I'm in schenley park.It's right by his house.
Well,can you wait for me?
I'll be 15 minutes.
I'll wait...but diana,just you.
Just me.
We just got here.Where you going?
Schenley park.
I think we caught a break on tom's case.
Tom!
Tom!
(Č±Ň»ľä)
Just marco.
At least,I thought it was marco.
I looked across the park.
You were standing there.
But it wasn'T.
Tell me about it.You weren't the one
actually chasing yourself across the park.
I mean,I don't really run like that,do I?
It's an amazing ability.Marco's
going to have a field day over this.
Good.Get him working on it.
We're going to need
a way to handle this guy
wait,wait,wait.No,
you don't need to skulk around anymore.
You can come in with me now.
I'm still on the hook for murder,diana.
No,you're not.
Boyd posed as you.He shot T.J.
Kim.You're not responsible.
Listen,I just saw his abilities
that's proof of something right there.
I will back you up on everything you say.
Which means exactly nothing.
I mean,thank you,diana,
but you're my partner.
Everyone expects you to stand up for me.
There's only one way to
prove I didn't kill T.J. Kim.
- I have to get boyd gelder.
- Okay,let's go.
You sure you want to come?
I'm your partner.
Everyone expects that I'll stand up for you.
I should be back by tonight.
I've...
been taking my time,stopping off at
all the places your mother liked.
Everything okay?You been going
to your doctors' appointments?
Most of them.
We need to keep monitoring you.
I'm fine.
Shawn's taking good care of me,just like
you asked.He's doing a really good job.
- Oh,yeah?
- Yeah.
He taught me the backstroke,
he let me drive his car...
and then I asked him to
have sex with me,but he said no.
He said you'd be angry.Is that true?
Isabelle...
you're too young to be thinking about...
- that.
- (Č±Ň»ľä)
But I thought I was almost 20.
How old were you when
you lost your virginity?
It was...
things were a bit different in my day.
It's not the same.
It's not?
Why?
You know what,isabelle?
I'm not having this conversation
with you over the phone.
So shawn was right.You are mad.
I don't understand.
What does ntac want to
talk to my son for,anyway?
He's in some trouble.We can't discuss it.
We just need to talk to him.
Well,he's not here.
He went away on a ski trip with some friends,
and he won't be back till tomorrow.
Ma'am...
your son is not on a ski trip,and this
is serious.Is there any way you can contact him?
First tell me what's going on.I mean,
what is it you think my son did?
Mrs. Gelder,there are a lot of agents...
people get hurt.The sooner we
get to your son,the safer he'll be.
So why don't you call him and
convince him you need to see him.
(Č±Ň»ľä)1
(Č±Ň»ľä)2
Nice mom,nice house...makes you wonder...
if the nova group can turn this kid,
who else have they gotten to?
Everyone keeps telling the 4400
they're here to save the world.
- Whatever that means.
- Exactly.
Say what you like about nova.
They do seem to have a game plan.
Well,I'm just guessing,
but I don't think that's boyd.
How the hell did ntac get here?
Maybe boyd figured out it
was a trap and tipped them off.
- (Č±Ň»ľä)
- Alana,open up.
There are ntac agents watching the house.
They just drove away.They must
be changing shifts.Come on,let me in.
Death in venice,okay?Open up.
I don't want anyone to see me come on.
What did you do with your key?
I lost it.I must have lost
it while I was running around.
Come on.It's me,tom,alana.
I gave you the password.
Please don't make me.
I don't have anything against you.
Tom...says it's your house.
Alana?
I just wrote a letter on your computer.(Č±Ň»ľä)
- Boyd?
- It's a confession.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
You shot T.J.,And now you can't live with it,
so you've decided to kill yourself.
Where's alana?What did you do?
It's my "get out of jail free" card.
See,you're the only
one who could identify me.
Everyone else,they've just been
seeing double.They'll sound crazy.
I'm not signing a suicide note,
boyd.Put alana on the phone.
Oh,you'll sign,'cause either I shoot you...
or I shoot her.
It's a trade.
Your life for hers.
You know what?
I don't think i can let you do this,tom.
We need to call jarvis.We need to block off
the street.We need to surround your house.
- He has alana.
- Tom,
he wants to kill you.The least thing we can
do is make it a little bit difficult for him.
If it was maia in there...would you call jarvis?
Do you like it?
Why did you bring this to me?
You're a young woman.(Č±Ň»ľä)
It's going to look good on you.
See for yourself.
Thank you.
I see you've been spending
a lot of time with shawn.
So?
(Č±Ň»ľä)
Shawn's a very isolated young man.
He doesn't get to spend much
time around people his own age.
I think...you should get
as close to him as you can.
Matthew?
Shawn's nice.
What I'm doing with him is not for you,
and it's not because i'm trying to use him.
Of course not...
but eventually,isabelle,
you and shawn are going to be on opposite
sides of a very large ideological divide,
so...enjoy your friendship...
but don't let your emotions run too deep.
It'll make things more difficult later.
What things?
You'll know.
It doesn't match your eyes.(Č±Ň»ľä)
You were a beautiful woman.
Both of you.
You looked exactly alike.
I never could figure out why.
One way or the other,I've had a
lily in my life for over 50 years.
That's all gone now...
and I don't know what I'm going to do...
but,uh...
it makes me feel better knowing
the two of you are together...
forever.
This is it for you,you know.
I don't know what kind of fairy
tale the nova group sold you,
but it doesn't matter
what happens to me,or tom.
Your life is over.
They sent you on a suicide mission.
I volunteered,and I don't think you're
in any spot to be giving me advice.
You're a 4400.
You're special.
You're supposed to be changing things.
Live with an ntac agent.
And what are you going to change,boyd?
You killed a girl.
How does that make the world better?
T.J. Kim was a soldier.
She would rather have me put a
bullet in her head than betray us.
Everyone talks about saving the world.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
Everything's been turning bad,
one disaster after another...
but we're going to show the world a new way.
We're going to take them down a new path...
by force if we have to.
Why can't you see the real
catastrophe is to sit back and do nothing?
Did you hear that?
Stop it!
Stop it,both of you!Stop,or I'll shoot.
Nice work,alana.We got him.Shut up!
Alana,death in venice.
Yeah,that's the password.
Come on,alana.Give me the gun.
We'll call ntac.It's over.
(Č±Ň»ľä)Ask me a question. Anything.
Don't fall for it.
He's probably read my file.He knows
everything about us.Don't listen to him.
Ask me something about us.
Something only I would know.
Anything about us.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
Baby...
I am so proud of you.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
You know about billy?
Yeah.That was your son.
He died in a car accident.
Alana,he did research.
Anyone could find that out.
Give me the gun.Just give me--
give me the gun.
Alana,give me the gun.
No.Alana...
give me the gun.
Get down on the ground.
What?
No,you've got the wrong one.
Think about this.
I said get down.
Don't move.
You're just a boy.
I'm a soldier.
And there are more of us every day.
Let's go,soldier.
Welcome back.
Yeah,thanks.Everything go okay?
Yeah,thank you,and thank you
for keeping an eye on isabelle.
Oh,well,it's not a problem.
Didn't really do much.
Yeah,well,thank you anyway.
I worry about her.
You don't really need to.
She seems to be getting along really well.
I'm her father. It's my job.
And it's harder with isabelle.
People see her,they see a woman,
a beautiful woman...
and they might forget that
inside she's just a little girl.
Still...
I'm glad she has you around...
to be a friend.
(Č±Ň»ľä)
How did you get in here?
I can do stuff,remember?
Yeah.
So,what's up?What do you need?
Just one thing.
It's on my list.
First kiss.
This isn't smart,isabelle.
Okay.

Proudly Presents</font>
Over the last 60 years 4400 people
have been abducted
<font color="#ffff00">-=www.ydy.com/bbs=-
proudly presents</font>
All at once they were returned
<font color="#ffff00">sync: xjeff0 gagegao heta_lee
-=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font>
With no memory of where they've been
They haven't aged a day
And some have returned with new abilities
All are trying to reconnect....
...with a life interrupted
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The worldwill have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
this is isabelle.
You are the stewards of the future.
Your daughter is the rosetta stone
for understanding what happened to the 4400.
Are you my mother?
Your rapid aging has caused her rapid aging.
The only way for you to live is for me to die.
Don't you understand who you are,
what you're here to do?
P.I....
promicin inhibitor.
We did it to them,tom.
We made them sick.
We are in a war.
This is a message from the nova group.
The second demonstration of our
capabilities is planned for october 19th.
You think I'm just going towrite you a check?
I need it tomorrow.
We couldn't even handle one when she
walked right in here and attacked the place.
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there all with abilities?
I gave you money to start a defensive
arm for the center
in case the government ever came after us again.
You lied to me,daniel.
You never said anything about killing people.
You sold us out.
You did the right thing by calling us,shawn.
You're a hero.
I'm tyler.
Maia.
Where are we?
This is where they altered us...
gave me the ability to create the world we've
been living in for the last eight years.
People see her,they see a woman,
and they might forget that,inside,
she's just a little girl.
I'm glad she has you around to be a friend.
You are ticklish.
Cut it out.
It bothers me.
It bothers you?
It didn't seem to bother you a few minutes ago.
I could hold you like this.
Oh,you could hold me like this?
Really?
What about that?
don't answer it.
I have to.
I'm still the boss around here.
Richard,hey.
Sorry to bother you.
I was waiting for you down in your office.
Oh,you know...
yeah,sorry.
I'm just running a little late this morning.
What's up?
Before lily...
um,before she passed,
she asked if I'd take over her job
at the foundation.
The healing work you do was really
important to her.
I remember.
I'm glad to have you aboard.
What do you need?
A better head for numbers.
I've been trying to decipher these
financial reports.
There's some pretty big cash payments.
You signed the transfers.
I figured you might remember what they were for.
no idea.
I'm sorry,no idea.
Just checking.
See you soon.
Maybe we should tell him.
No,no,I don't think so.
We just...
we've just got to be more careful
from now on,okay?
Okay.
Thank you for doing this,thomas.
I know an open house at the center
isn't your favorite sunday activity.
Hey,I love a good barbecue.
You've been spending a lot of time here.
If this place is important to you,
it's important to me.
I don't believe you,
but I love you for saying it,
and don't be nervous.
Everyone here's going to love you,too.
So help me out here,tom.
You say you love alana,
and yet she's a 4400,
and you're an ntac agent.
I mean,if I were you,
and I really loved her,
well,I'd quit that job.
First of all,you're not me.
You don't know anything about me.
You don't know anything about this relationship,
and frankly,I doubt you know much about ntac.
you did almost kill us all.
Thanks for the input,ryan.
Nice chatting with you.
I am so sorry,thomas.
He's usually not that rude.
We've been here an hour.
I've had four conversations like that.
You think we can call it a day?
Alana?
I didn't realize your thomas was tom baldwin.
Remember me?
Heather tobey.
Nice to see a friendly face.
How are you?
I couldn't be better.
Tom was my hero.
you mean heather was one of your assignments?
about eight months ago.
********
Heather,you seem great.
What are you up to?
I teach at the school here now.
It's a good match,huh?
Finally found a place where they won't run me
out on the rails for being a 4400,
and now alana and i are going to be
working together.
Isn't that cool?
I've been offered a job working with
the children at the school.
But I haven't decided if I'm going to take it yet.
I blew the surprise,didn't I?
So help me out here.
Who's amy again?
Is she a 4400?
Everyone in my class is a 4400.
She wants me to come over tomorrow.
********
Oh,it's not?
Well,I guess when you put it like that,
then there's no way i can say no.
Where's your sweater?
I left it upstairs.
Quickly run and get it.
It's freezing by the water.
We're going to miss the ferry.
You're going to forget me.
Excuse me?
********
*****
Maia,do you mind explaining that,
because,frankly,it sounds a little creepy.
It's okay.
It's not your fault.
***
I would never forget you.
Not ever.
Come on,you know that,don't you?
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Maia,come on.
Come on,sweetie,
we're going to miss the boat,literally.
Maia,come here right now.
Mommy,it's okay.
-It's fine--
-who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I was just knocking on your door
when maia came upstairs.
It's so great.
Tell her.
Tell me what?
Ms. Skouris,my name is sara.
Sara rutledge.
I'm maia's sister.
<font color="#ffff00">4400
Season 03 Episode 04</font>
He was my dog.
I know.
He slept on your bed,every night,
right until he died.
You really lived in my house?
22 white oak lane,crescent city.
My room was at the top of the steps.
I know.
It was always your room.
Mom and dad kept it all the same,just for you.
They missed you so much.
Maia,I need you to give me some time alone
with sara.
Did daddy teach you to play poker?
We played for tootsie rolls.
Maia...
I think your mom needs a word with me,sweetie.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to sandbag you.
I was going to leave a note.
**********
Every phone number out of date,
every letter comes back "return to sender."
Guyana,the ivory coast?
I've been hard to find.
**********
Which,I'm guessing,is...
is why you never told maia about me.
I'm sorry,
what was I supposed to say?
"Sweetheart, you have an older sister,
"but it doesn't seem like she's terribly
interested in meeting you?"
I'm sorry.
I should have called first.
I just felt like i needed to do this in person.
I just want to know her.
That's all.
You think it's that easy?
There are a lot of people to get close to a 4400.
Until you can prove to me that you are
who you say you are,
you're not seeing my daughter again.
*******
I'm willing to take a dna test.
It's a good start.
You didn't even tell me you were thinking
about teaching,
that the possibility existed.
To be honest,I was avoiding it.
I know how you feel about the center.
*********
They're not fine with me.
What about your gallery?
I can still do all the buying,
and tina can handle sales.
Okay,I'm sorry if this seems just-- sudden.I...
I told them about my ability at the center,
and they thought they could use it at the school.
You're going to use your ability?
Don't you think that's why we came back here
with these gifts?
To help other people?
No,it sounds great.
I just didn't think that...
I mean,does it even work with other people?
I did an experiment with heather.
We went to paris for lunch.
Don't worry,
I don't think my batteries run out.
I'll save my best work for you.
I promise.
I'd like to thank you for agreeing
to be a part of our...
experiment,I guess you'd call it.
We've never tried a healing this large,
but we think you'll all be very happy
with the results.
Before we begin,
I'd like to say that this foundation was
started by my late wife,lily tyler.
I'm proud to be carrying on her work.
She's the reason why we're all here today.
her,and the man i'm about to introduce to you...
shawn farrell.
Thank you.
Okay
,first off,
kids,
I promise this is not going to hurt.
listen,I'd like to ask everyone here a favor.
When you leave here today--
and you will be leaving the hospital today--
please tell anyone that asks
that a 4400 made you better,
**********
because we're not bogeymen.
We're here to help.
So...
let's get this thing started.
Traitor!
You betrayed your own kind.
Next time it won't be paint!
You okay?
It's in her file.
Maia's parents had a baby five years after
she disappeared,
and her name was sara.
so it is possible.
No word at all for two years,
and then she just shows up?
You think she's the real deal?
I don't know,maybe.
What does your gut tell you?
it tells me that she's not going to see
maia again
until the dna tests comes back.
Smart gut.
Her name is lindsey hammond.
She disappeared on november 23,1979.
You know,just once,
I wish a 4400 would smile for their picture.
Is that too much to ask?
Since her return,
she's been living with her stepfather.
Until yesterday,that is.
What,she's missing?
her stepfather thinks she ran away.
Take a drive out to her house,
see if we need to be worried.
That just came in.
***********Wasn't random.
Somehow you've become a target of the nova group.
Any idea why?
Two months ago...
someone called me.
They were trying to raise money to start
a defensive wing of the 4400.
I made a couple of contributions.
You gave money to the nova group?
Shawn,they murdered half a dozen people.
That was after.
Do you really think i would have given them money
if I thought that they were going to hurt anybody?
When they came back asking for more,
I said no.
You got the money from the foundation,didn't you?
That's what all those signatures were for.
You diverted money from my wife's foundation
to a terrorist group?
Richard,it was a mistake.
I know that.
Don't you think I know that?
I'll serve to you.
We have to try to keep it going for
as long as we can.
Okay?
Maia...
where's maia?
She's at a friend's house--
a girl from the class. Why?
Preliminary dna came back.
Negative match.
Sara isn't maia's sister.
Where's maia?
They're in the yard.
I-is everything okay?
Maia!
She left.
Where did she go?
She went with that lady, her sister.
Her picture's already on the wire.
An amber alert's been issued.
We'll find her,diana.
I know we will.
We're tapped into every surveillance
camera in the city downstairs.
We're monitoring every toll booth,
every intersection we can.
If sara shows up on any of them,
we can be there in minutes.
You're going to keep an eye on things
yourself,right?
you got it.
Okay.
*******
What did the lab say?
Nothing good.
They ran the fingerprints from your apartment,
and the dna samples against every known database.
No names came up.
So she has maia.
We have no idea who she is.
No.
She said i was going to forget her.
Mom really kept my room just like I left it?
Sure she did.
She always believed that you were going
to come home.
Maia,can I ask you a question?
Do you see the future more clearly since
you stopped taking the inhibitor?
at first,I couldn't control it.
I thought i was going crazy,
but now i can see the future,
more when I want to.
It doesn't really sneak up on me anymore.
Not much,anyway.
That's great.
You're learning to focus your ability.
What if I asked you to predict something
right now?
Wait.
We can go now.
You are a very special girl.
What do you think?
This is your house?
I bought it so I can stay in seattle.
We've spent enough time apart,
don't you think?
Come on.
Let me show you the inside.
There's a surprise.
my gosh.
It's just like my old room.
I told you mom kept it the same.
Else how would I know?
Sorry to interrupt--
hoping i could have a word?
Matthew...
come on in.
What's on your mind?
I was brought into this organization
by jordan collier.
I didn't always know what he had
in mind for it,
but I did know that he was a man
of experience and vision.
Six months after i came aboard,he died.
My new boss was a 19-year-old boy.
This is about shawn?
He's overwhelmed,richard.
Running this center requires substantive
decisions,
decisions that he's not qualified to make.
Now,you,on the other hand,
you were an officer.
You led men into battle--
stop.
Shawn runs things here.
I am not interested in a palace coup.
I am not talking about getting rid of him.
I'm talking about power sharing.
The two of you make decisions together.
It's a way of helping him,
giving him the benefit of your experience.
This is all very flattering.
I'm not trying to flatter you.
I'm trying to keep this movement alive.
Think about it.
And before you say no,
I want you to tell me,
could you,under any circumstances,
see yourself inadvertently funding
a terrorist attack?
Look familiar?
Maia's been drawing it a lot the last few days.
Are you sure?I mean,it's all through
the margins of her journals.
I've never seen it before,
but she likes butterflies.
It might just be a doodle.
Did you find anything else,
anything we can use?
It's hard to say.
I mean,it's all stream of consciousness.
You know,predictions about big events
right next to tiny things in her everyday life,
and there's no dates.
I did find out how I'm going to die.
that was interesting.
Oh,don't worry.
It's actually kind of cool.
,she did mention a friend's house.
Just referred to the mom,though,mrs. Paspalis.
Amy paspalis?
That's the house she was taken from.
Great,show us that page.
Spooky.
I could spend the rest of my career
working on these things.
Come on,marco,just...
here.
********
But I'm already gone."
I'm in a circle with tyler downing."
Tyler downing?
Isn't he a 4400?
He goes to school with maia.
1
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,920
I told you,
I didn't do anything to maia.I swear!
Look,nobody thinks
that you did anything.
I just need you
to try and remember.
Now,did she ever talk to you
about a circle?
Did she ever mention XXXXXXXXXXX
no,I said already 10 times.
I'm not lying--
ma'am,I know you're worried about your kid.
You're scaring the crap out of my brother.
Diana...
there's nothing here.
There's no sign of maia or the woman.
"I'm in the circle with tyler downing."
Tyler's here,so where is maia?
I don't know.Maybe if we knew what circle
she was talking about.
Is it a street? Barnaby circle?
There's a circle park--
well,we need to check them all,
because she's trying to tell me how to find her.
sara...
is my mom coming
to pick me up soon?
Sara?
Sara,the door won't open.
Sara?
You can yell
all you want.
She won't come.
She never does.
Who are you?
I'm lindsey.
I'm a part of her collection.
We all are.
Now you are,too.
All of us are 4400s.
What is she
going to do to us?
Sell us to the highest bidder,
do experiments,I mean,who knows?
It doesn't matter.
We're not going to let it come to that.
Hello?
That was incredible.
Hi.
Oh,hi,thomas.I didn't hear you
come in.
Any word about maia?
Sorry to invade your house,tom.
Alana and i were just practicing.
I think I might take that job at the school.
Heather and I were just trying something.
Don't be shy about it.
Alana just took me back
to the year I disappeared.
We just watched richard nixon fly away
from the white house after he resigned.
That's remarkable,huh?
Well,alana's an amazing woman.
She certainly is.
Are you all right,thomas?
Fine.I'm just...
I'm just worried for diana.
She's strong,
and so are you.
After heather leaves,XXXXXXXXXX
it might calm you down some.
No,I think I'm just going to
go to sleep,
hit the investigation fresh
in the morning.
So things are going well
between you and shawn?
Yeah,I think so.
We're having lots of sex.
Has he said
"I love you" yet?
No.
Do you think he should have?
Try this.
It would be a way to gauge
the level of his involvement.
Men can do things with their bodies
entirely unrelated to their hearts and minds.
Shawn likes me.
It's real.
Good.
Shawn's going to be having
a difficult time these next few days.
He's going to have
some decisions to make.
You need to help guide him
toward the right choice.
You want me to use him?
Use him?
What does that even mean?
You're getting close to shawn,right?
So he'll value your advice.
That's a relationship.
That's two people trusting each other.
I guess.
- What do you want me to say to him?
- Just the truth.
A leader should never be afraid
to ask for help.
It's not a sign of weakness.
It's a display of strength.
Wear that.
Hey,kid...
you have to try
to be quiet,okay?
I just want to go home.
We all do,but crying is not
going to help.
Listen,we can do stuff.
They can'T.
That's why they want us,
but maybe we can use it against them.
Maybe we could figure out a way
to get us out of here.
Everyone,tell me
what you can do,okay?
My sister and me,
we can make water move.
Back and forth.Our teacher says
we can make dis-fusion happen.
- Diffusion.
- Yeah.
We have to be together to do it,though.
What about you,kid?
I do stuff with electricity.
Currents.
I can make machines
in my kitchen stop working.
Okay,good,
that will come in handy.
I can see things,
things that are going to happen.
Really?
That's awesome.
Can you tell if they're going to
keep us here?Are they going to let us go?
Come on,tell us.
We're not going to be here long.
Why,do we get to go home?
I don't think so.
Sorry I asked.
Listen,I don't know
about the rest of you,
but I'm going to try to figure out a way
to get us out of here.
So are you guys up for it?
No,let me go!
Stop! Let me go!
Stop it!
Let me go!
Help me!
Let me go!
Help!
Stop it! Let me go!
No!
Tyler downing wasn't home when his sister
got back from her waitressing shift last night.
My god,that's the third
4400 kid missing.
No,try five.
Olivia and duncan germaine's parents thought they
went on a camping trip with their youth group.
Turns out they never showed.
Tom,update me here.
What are we doing to find this woman?
Well,maia's journal said
she was inside the circle with tyler downing.
We've checked out every street
with the name "circle" in it.
Skyline circle park, circle theater
on first hill. And there's nothing yet.
What about the reservoirs?
They're basically circular.
We've already looked.
There's a prayer circle scheduled
this morning in denny park.Maybe there.
It's over here.
Hey,I thought
you could use a jolt.
Thanks.
Didn't get
much sleep last night.
Any,actually.
This helps.
You were up all night?
You should go lie down
in the theory room for an hour.
Tom...
diana,
you all right?
Look.
"I'm in the circle..."
I don't believe this.
I tell you the truth...
and you use it
to kick me out.
No,shawn.
I'm just talking about helping you.
You've got an impossible job.
Jordan collier left me in charge
of this place.
For the past year and a half,
it has been my entire life.
So thank you for the offer,
but I am good.
The center has a board of directors,
shawn,
and collier's appointment of you
is subject to their ongoing approval.
They approved it because that's what
jordan wanted,matthew.
Frankly,if jordan was here,
his thoughts on succession might change
if he knew you bankrolled an attack
on the united states government.
You've made yourself,and this place,
a target for terrorists.
Shawn...
when you got sick
from the inhibitor,
you asked me to pinch-hit for you.
It's like that.You need help.
You're talking like
you're offering me a choice.
- I am.
- Really?
Because right now
it sounds like a threat.
Tyler,you have to talk to us.
No.
If we get out of the house,
can you make it so their cars can't start?
No,I'm not helping.
Didn't you see what they did
to that other girl? They took her away.
- I don't want to go away.
- You will.
We all will if we don't do something.
Lindsey...
lindsey,are you okay?
Who are you?
What did they do to you?
Maia,do you want to come with me,please?
No.
It's okay,sweetie,it's not so bad.I promise.
Help!
Tyler! Duncan!Please!
Somebody help me! Help!
Seattle pd has the south edge.
We'll take center and work east.
It'd be nice if I knew what we were looking for.
A message.
A sign.
Anything.
Oh...
do you like this?
You're seriously asking?
I knew you would.
I picked it out just for you.
Green's your favorite color,isn't it?
I can tell.
I know you now.
Isabelle.Isabelle...
I'm not really ready for another
round right now,okay?
What are you so worried about?
If you don't want to share your job,don't.
What are you talking about?
I can do things,shawn.
Lots of them.
I figure out more every day.
If you want to keep your job,you can.
I can make it happen.
You can do whatever.
Who's going to say different?
Thanks,I guess,
but,uh...
just hold off on the air strikes,okay?
We're talking about your dad
and matthew here.
It's just an argument.
They're not the enemy.
Besides...
they do have a point,don't they?
I did screw up.
Okay.
Just so you know,it's your call.
Drink this.
It'll make you feel better.
You're frightened.
It's all right,I understand,
but you don't have to be.
We're not going to hurt you.
Soon,you won't even be worried anymore,
I promise.
These are just to relax you.
They'll help you get ready.
Now,drink up,okay?
I'll give you a brownie for dessert.
No.
Maia...
They're doing it.They're helping.
We'll take dexter south,swing around
for another pass.
Wait,tom. Stop. Stop!
What?
Those butterflies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
She's here.
Maia...
what is going on?
Don't move!
Please.
Please,this house is for sale.
All the valuables are gone.
Is this a dream?
No,honey.
Remember the first time you were
taken away from your parents?
This is where we brought you.
No.
This isn't real.
Yes,it is.
We've brought you back.
You've been here ever since you
walked through the front door of my house.
You're in the future.
We had to bring you here,maia,
you and your friends.
We need your help.
XXXXXXX
The 4400 haven't changed the timeline.
The catastrophe,it's still coming.
We've found a way to fix it.
You and your friends,
you're going to save us all.
We found it all.
The circle,
the butterflies...
she's here.
I mean,she has to be here.
Come on,I'll take you home.
Here.
Sign here.
Thank you,shawn.
I know this wasn't an easy decision.
We all want the same things,
you're a good man,shawn.
It's an honor to be working with you.
Why are you giving this to me?
It's a thank you.
You did well.
Everything went smoothly with shawn.
I disobeyed you,matthew.
I told shawn he should keep his job.
I disobeyed you,and you know what?
Nothing happened.
There wasn't an earthquake.
I didn't melt.
I used to be scared of you,
but I don't think you have any
power over me at all,do you?
I didn't think so.
I'll do my own shopping from now on,okay?
Okay,sweetheart,we're ready to begin.
Don't cry.
You and the other children we took,
we tested your abilities,
and you are so special.
That's why you were chosen.
Now...
here's what's going to happen.
We're going to put you all back--
not the same year we took you from,
but earlier,much earlier.
We calculated wrong the first time.
We have to try again.
There's no other way.
There's no other hope for humanity.
I don't care.
I don't want to go anywhere.
I want to stay with my mom.
I know.It's hard.
I can make the pain go away.
Before we put you back in your new time,
we'll make you forget your mother,
marco,and your friends.
Please don'T.
They'll forget you,too.
It's better this way.
There'll be no sorrow,no pain,no loss.
As far as the world is concerned,
you'll just be a girl who disappeared
in 1946 and was never found.
That's a lie.
My mom won't ever forget me.
She will.
It's happening already.
Now...
just lie still.
All the hope we have rests with you.
No...
don't do it,please.
Mommy!

To Be Continued
We're not a threat,
We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
This is lsabelle.
You are the stewards of the future.
Your daughter is the Rosetta stone
for understanding what happened
to the 4400.
- Are you my mother?
- Your rapid aging
has caused her rapid aging.
The only way for you to live
is for me to die.
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?
P.I. Promicin inhibitor.
We did it to them, Tom.
- We made them sick.
- We are in a war.
This is a message
from The Nova Group,
The second demonstration
of our capabilities
is planned for October 19th,
You think I'm gonna
write you a check?
I need it tomorrow.
We couldn't even handle one when
she walked in and attacked the place.
Now there's a whole team
of assassins, all with abilities?
I gave you money to start
a defensive arm for the Center
in case the government
ever came after us again.
You lied to me, Daniel.
You never said anything
about killing people.
You sold us out.
You did the right thing
by calling me, Shawn.
You're a hero.
- Hey, I'm Tyler.
- Maia.
- Where are we?
- This is where they altered us.
Gave me the ability
to create the world
we've been living in
for the last eight years.
People see her, they see a woman.
And they might forget that inside,
she's just a little girl.
I'm glad she had you around
to be a friend.
You are ticklish.
Cut it out.
- That bothers me.
- It bothers you?
It didn't seem to bother you
a few minutes ago.
- I could hold you like this.
- You could hold me like this?
- Really?
- Yeah.
What about that?
Oh, don't answer it. Don't answer it.
I have to.
I'm still the boss around here.
I have to.
Richard, hey.
Sorry to bother you.
I was waiting for you in your office.
Oh, you know--
Yeah, sorry, I'm just running
a little late this morning. What's up?
Before Lily-- Before she passed,
she asked if I'd take over her job
at the foundation.
The healing work you do
was really important to her.
I remember.
I'm glad to have you aboard.
- What do you need?
- A better head for numbers.
I've been trying to decipher
these financial reports.
There's some
pretty big cash payments.
You signed the transfers,
I figured you might remember
what they were for.
No idea. I'm sorry, no idea.
Just checking.
See you soon.
Maybe we should tell him.
No. No, I don't think so.
We just...
We just gotta be more careful
from now on, okay?
Okay.
Thank you for doing this, Thomas.
I know an open house at the Center
isn't your favorite Sunday activity.
I love a good barbecue.
You've been spending
a lot of time here.
If this place is important to you,
it's important to me.
I don't believe you,
but I love you for saying it.
And don't be nervous, everyone here
is going to love you too.
So help me out here, Tom.
You say you love Alana,
and yet she's a 4400
and you're an NTAC agent.
I mean, if I were you
and I really loved her, I'd quit that job.
First of all, you're not me.
You don't know anything about me.
You don't know anything
about this relationship and frankly,
I doubt you know much
about NTAC.
Well, they did almost kill us all.
Thanks for the input, Ryan.
Nice chatting with you.
I am so sorry, Thomas.
He's usually not that rude.
We've been here an hour.
I've had four conversations like that.
- You think we can call it a day?
- Alana?
I didn't realize your Thomas
was Tom Baldwin.
- Remember me?
- Heather Tobey.
Nice to see a friendly face.
How are you?
I couldn't be better.
Tom was my hero.
Oh, you mean Heather
was one of your assignments?
Yeah, about eight months ago.
Back when I first got my ability.
Heather, you seem great.
What are you up to?
I teach at the school here now.
It's a good match, huh?
Finally found a place where
they won't run me out on the rails
for being a 4400.
And now Alana and l
are gonna be working together.
Isn't that cool?
I've been offered a job
working with the children at the school.
But I haven't decided
if I'm going to take it yet.
I blew the surprise, didn't l?
So help me out here.
Who is Amy again?
- Is she a 4400?
- Everyone in my class is a 4400.
She wants me to come over tomorrow.
It's not a huge deal.
Oh, it's not?
I guess when you put it like that,
then there's no way I can say no.
- Where's your sweater?
- I left it upstairs.
Run and get it.
It's freezing by the water.
We're gonna miss the ferry.
- You're gonna forget me.
- Excuse me?
You're gonna forget me. I saw it.
Maia, do you mind explaining that?
Because frankly,
it sounds a little creepy.
It's okay. It's not your fault.
Maia, listen to me.
I would never forget you.
Not ever.
Come on, you know that, don't you?
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Maia, come on.
Come on, sweetie.
We're gonna miss the boat, literally.
- Maia, come here right now.
- Mommy, it's okay. It's fine.
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I was just knocking on your door
when Maia came upstairs.
It's so great.
- Tell her.
- Tell me what?
Ms. Skouris, my name is Sara.
Sara Rutledge.
I'm Maia's sister.
That's Lemon. He was my dog.
I know. He slept on your bed,
every night, right until he died.
You really lived in my house?
22 White Oak Lane, Crescent City.
- My room was at the top of the stairs.
- I know. It was always your room.
Mom and Dad kept it all the same,
just for you.
They missed you so much.
Maia, I need you to give me
some time alone with Sara.
Did Daddy teach you to play poker?
- We played for Tootsie Rolls.
- Maia.
I think your mom needs
a word with me, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to sandbag you.
I was gonna leave a note.
I've been trying to find you for years.
Every phone number out of date.
Every letter comes back
return to sender.
Guyana? The lvory Coast?
I've been hard to find.
Hard to find?
I didn't know if you were alive or dead.
Which, I'm guessing,
is why you never told Maia about me.
I'm sorry,
what was I supposed to say?
"Sweetheart,
you have an older sister,
but it doesn't seem like she's
terribly interested in meeting you"?
I'm sorry.
I should have called first.
I just felt like
I needed to do this in person.
I just want to know her.
That's all.
You think it's that easy?
There are a lot of people
who would do anything
to get close to a 4400.
Until you can prove to me
that you are who you say you are,
you're not seeing
my daughter again.
I understand.
I'm willing to take a DNA test.
That's a good start.
You didn't even tell me
you were thinking about teaching,
that the possibility existed.
To be honest, I was avoiding it.
I know how you feel about the Center.
No, I'm fine with the Center.
They're not fine with me.
What about your gallery?
I can still do all the buying
and Tina can handle sales.
Look, I'm sorry
if this seems just sudden.
I told them about my ability
at the Center,
and they thought
they could use it at the school.
You're gonna use your ability?
Don't you think that's why
we came back here with these gifts?
To help other people?
Yeah, yeah. No, it sounds great.
I just didn't think that...
I mean, does it even work
with other people?
I did an experiment with Heather.
We went to Paris for lunch.
Don't worry,
I don't think my batteries run out.
I'll save my best work for you.
I promise.
I'd like to thank you for agreeing
to be a part of our experiment,
I guess you'd call it.
We've never tried
a healing this large,
but we think you'll all be very happy
with the results.
Before I begin,
I'd like to say that this foundation
was started by my late wife, Lily Tyler.
I'm proud to be carrying on
her work.
She's the reason
why we are all here today.
Well, her and a man
I'm about to introduce to you.
Shawn Farrell.
Thank you.
Okay, first off, kids,
I promise this is not gonna hurt.
Listen, I'd like to ask
everyone here a favor.
When you leave here today,
and you will be leaving
the hospital today,
please tell anyone that asks
that a 4400 made you better.
Made your children better.
Because we're not bogeymen,
we're here to help.
- So let's get this thing started.
- Traitor! Traitor to your own kind.
Next time it won't be paint.
You okay?
Yeah.
It's in her file.
Maia's parents had a baby
five years after she disappeared
and her name was Sara.
So it is possible.
No word at all for two years
and then she just shows up.
- You think she's the real deal?
- I don't know. Maybe.
What does your gut tell you?
Oh, it tells me that
she's not gonna see Maia again
until the DNA tests come back.
Smart gut.
Her name is Lindsey Hammond.
She disappeared
November 23rd, 1 979.
You know, just once I wish a 4400
would smile for their picture.
Is that too much to ask?
Since her return she's been living
with her stepfather.
Until yesterday, that is.
What, she's missing?
Well, her stepfather thinks
she ran away.
Take a drive out to her house.
See if we need to be worried.
That just came in.
The attack at the hospital
this morning wasn't random.
Somehow you've become a target
of the Nova Group.
Any idea why?
Two months ago,
someone called me.
They were trying to raise money
to start a defensive wing of the 4400.
I made a couple of contributions.
You gave money
to the Nova Group?
Shawn, they murdered
half a dozen people.
That was after.
Do you think I would have
given them money
if I thought that
they were gonna hurt anybody?
When they came back
asking for more, I said no.
You got the money
from the foundation, didn't you?
That's what all those signatures
were for.
You diverted money from my wife's
foundation to a terrorist group?
Richard, it was a mistake.
I know that.
Don't you think I know that?
I'll serve to you.
We have to try to keep it going
for as long as we can, okay?
Maia?
Where's Maia?
She's at a friend's house.
A girl from the class. Why?
Preliminary DNA came back.
Negative match.
Sara isn't Maia's sister.
Where's Maia?
They're in the yard.
Is everything okay?
Maia!
- She left.
- Where did she go?
She went with that lady. Her sister.
Her picture's already on the wire.
An AMBER Alert's been issued.
- We'll find her, Diana.
- I know we will.
We're tapped into every surveillance
camera in the city downstairs.
We're monitoring every tollbooth,
every intersection we can.
If Sara shows up on any of them,
we can be there in minutes.
You're gonna keep an eye
on things yourself, right?
- Yeah, yeah, you got it.
- Okay.
- Tom, what did the lab say?
- Nothing good.
They ran the fingerprints from
your apartment and the DNA samples
against every known database.
No names came up.
So she has Maia,
we have no idea who she is.
No.
She said I was going to forget her.
Mom really kept my room
just like I left it?
Sure she did.
She always believed
that you were gonna come home.
Maia, can I ask you a question?
Do you see the future more clearly
since you stopped taking
the inhibitor?
Well, at first I couldn't control it.
I thought I was going crazy.
But now I can see the future,
more when I want to.
It doesn't really
sneak up on me anymore.
- Not much anyway.
- That's great.
You're learning to focus your ability.
What if I asked you
to predict something right now?
Wait.
We can go now.
You are a very special girl.
What do you think?
This is your house?
I bought it so I can stay in Seattle.
We've spent enough time apart,
don't you think?
Come on, let me show you the inside.
There's a surprise.
Oh, my gosh.
It's just like my old room.
I told you Mom kept it the same,
else how would I know?
Sorry to interrupt.
Hoping I could have a word.
Matthew.
Come on in. What's on your mind?
I was brought into this organization
by Jordan Collier.
I didn't always know
what he had in mind for it,
but I did know that he was a man
of experience and vision.
Six months after I came aboard,
he died.
My new boss was a 1 9-year-old boy.
This is about Shawn?
He's overwhelmed, Richard.
Running this Center
requires substantive decisions.
Decisions that he's not qualified
to make.
But you, on the other hand...
You were an officer.
You led men into battle.
Stop. Shawn runs things here.
I am not interested
in a palace coup.
I'm not talking about
getting rid of him.
I'm talking about power-sharing.
The two of you
make decisions together.
It's a way of helping him.
Giving him the benefit
of your experience.
This is all very flattering.
I'm not trying to flatter you.
I'm trying to keep
this movement alive.
Think about it.
And before you say no,
I want you to tell me,
could you,
under any circumstances,
see yourself inadvertently
funding a terrorist attack?
Look familiar?
Maia's been drawing it a lot
the last few days.
You sure? It's all
through the margins of her journals.
Well, I've never seen it before,
but she likes butterflies.
It might just be a doodle.
You find anything else?
Anything we can use?
It's hard to say. I mean,
it's all stream of consciousness.
Predictions about big events right next
to tiny things in her everyday life.
And there's no dates.
Oh, did find out how I'm gonna die.
Yeah, that was interesting.
Don't worry, it's actually kind of cool.
She did mention a friend's house.
Just referred to the mom, though.
Mrs. Paspalis.
Amy Paspalis.
That's the house she was taken from.
Great, show us that page.
Spooky. I could spend the rest
of my career working on these things.
- Come on, Marco, just--
- Yeah, yeah.
Here.
"Mommy's coming to pick me up
from Mrs. Paspalis' house,
but I'm already gone.
I'm in a circle with Tyler Downing."
Tyler Downing?
- lsn't he a 4400?
- He goes to school with Maia.
I told you, I didn't do anything to Maia.
I swear.
Look, nobody thinks
that you did anything.
I just need you
to try and remember.
Now, did she ever talk to you
about a circle?
Did she ever mention having visions
about the two of you?
No. I said already ten times,
I'm not lying.
Ma'am, I know you're worried
about your kid,
but you're scaring the crap
out of my brother.
Diana.
There's nothing here.
There's no sign of Maia or the woman.
"I'm in a circle with Tyler Downing."
Tyler's here, so where is Maia?
I don't know.
Maybe if we knew what circle
she was talking about.
Is it a street? Barnaby Circle?
There's a Circle Park--
We need to check them all, because
she's trying to tell me how to find her.
Sara?
Is my mom coming
to pick me up soon?
Sara?
Sara, the door won't open.
Sara?
You can yell all you want,
she won't come.
She never does.
Who are you?
I'm Lindsey.
I'm a part of her collection.
We all are.
Now you are too.
All of us are 4400s?
What is she gonna do to us?
Sell us to the highest bidder
or do experiments?
I mean, who knows?
It doesn't matter.
We're not gonna let it come to that.
Hello?
That was incredible.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Thomas.
I didn't hear you come in.
Any word about Maia?
Sorry to invade your house, Tom.
Alana and I were just practicing.
I think I might take that job
at the school.
Heather and l
were just trying something.
Don't be shy about it.
Alana just took me back
to the year I disappeared.
We just watched Richard Nixon
fly away from the White House
after he resigned.
It's remarkable, huh?
Well, Alana's an amazing woman.
She certainly is.
Are you all right, Thomas?
I'm fine. I'm just...
I'm just worried for Diana.
She's strong. And so are you.
After Heather leaves,
you want me to take you somewhere?
It might calm you down some.
No, I think
I'm just gonna go to sleep.
Hit the investigation
fresh in the morning.
So things are going well
between you and Shawn?
Yeah, I think so.
We're having lots of sex.
Has he said, "l love you," yet?
No.
Do you think he should have?
Try this.
It would be a way to gauge
the level of his involvement.
Men can do things with their bodies
entirely unrelated
to their hearts and minds.
Shawn likes me. It's real.
Good.
Shawn's gonna be having
a difficult time these next few days.
He's gonna have
some decisions to make.
You need to help guide him
toward the right choice.
You want me to use him?
Use him?
What does that even mean?
You're getting close to Shawn, right?
So he'll value your advice.
That's a relationship.
That's two people trusting each other.
I guess.
What do you want me
to say to him?
Just the truth.
A leader should never be afraid
to ask for help.
It's not a sign of weakness,
it's a display of strength.
Wear that.
Hey, kid,
you have to try to be quiet, okay?
I just wanna go home.
We all do,
but crying is not going to help.
Listen, we can do stuff they can't.
That's why they want us.
But maybe we can use it against them,
maybe we could figure out a way
to get us out of here.
Everyone tell me
what you can do, okay?
My sister and me,
we can make water move.
Back and forth.
Our teacher says
we can make dis-fusion happen.
Diffusion.
Yeah.
We have to be together
to do it, though.
What about you, kid?
I do stuff with electricity. Currents.
I can make machines in my kitchen
stop working.
Okay, good, that will come in handy.
I can see things.
Things that are gonna happen.
Really? That's awesome.
Can you tell
if they're gonna keep us here?
Are they gonna let us go?
Come on, tell us.
We're not gonna be here long.
Why? Do we get to go home?
I don't think so.
Sorry I asked.
Listen, I don't know
about the rest of you,
but I'm gonna try to figure out
a way to get us out of here.
Are you guys up for it?
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Stop it! Let me go!
Help me! Let me go!
Help! Somebody! Let me go! Help!
Tyler Downing wasn't home
when his sister got back
from her waitressing shift last night.
My God,
that's the third 4400 kid missing.
No, try five.
Olivia and Duncan Germaine's
parents
thought they went on a camping trip
with their youth group.
It turns out they never showed.
Tom, update me, here.
What are we doing
to find this woman?
Well, Maia's journal said she was
inside the circle with Tyler Downing.
We've checked out every street
with the name Circle in it.
Skyline Circle Park,
Circle Theatre on First Hill.
There's nothing yet.
What about the reservoirs?
They're basically circular.
We've already looked.
There's a prayer circle scheduled
this morning in Denny Park.
- Maybe there.
- It's over here.
Hey, I thought you could use a jolt.
Thanks.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
Any, actually. This helps.
You were up all night?
You should go lay down
in the Theory Room for an hour.
Tom.
Diana, are you all right?
Look.
"I'm in the circle."
I don't believe this.
I tell you the truth
and you use it to kick me out?
No, Shawn.
I'm just talking about helping you.
You've got an impossible job.
Jordan Collier left me
in charge of this place.
For the past year and a half,
it has been my entire life.
So thank you for the offer,
but I am good.
The Center
has a board of directors, Shawn.
And Collier's appointment of you
is subject to their ongoing approval.
They approved it because
that's what Jordan wanted, Matthew.
If Jordan was here, his thoughts
on succession might change
if he knew you bankrolled an attack
on the United States government.
You've made yourself and this place
a target for terrorists.
Shawn,
when you got sick
from the inhibitor,
you asked me to pinch-hit for you.
It's like that.
You need help.
You're talking like
you're offering me a choice.
- I am.
- Really?
Because right now
it sounds like a threat.
- Tyler, you have to talk to us.
- No.
If we get out of the house, can you
make it so their cars can't start?
No, I'm not helping.
Didn't you see what they did
to that other girl?
They took her away.
I don't wanna go away.
You will.
We all will if we don't do something.
Lindsey. Lindsey, are you okay?
Who are you?
What did they do to you?
Maia, do you wanna come
with me, please?
No.
It's okay, sweetie.
It's not so bad. I promise.
Tyler! Duncan!
Please, somebody help me!
Help!
Seattle P.D. has the south edge.
We'll take center and work east.
It would be nice if we knew
what we were looking for.
A message.
A sign.
Anything.
Do you like this?
You are seriously asking?
I knew you would.
I picked it out just for you.
Green's your favorite color, isn't it?
I can tell.
I know you now.
Isabelle, lsabelle.
I'm not really ready
for another round right now, okay?
What are you so worried about?
If you don't wanna share
your job, don't.
What are you talking about?
I can do things, Shawn.
Lots of them.
I figure out more every day.
If you wanna keep your job,
you can.
I can make it happen.
You can do whatever.
Who's gonna say different?
Thanks, I guess.
But why don't you just hold off
on the air strikes, okay?
We're talking about
your dad and Matthew here.
It's just an argument.
They're not the enemy.
Besides, they do have a point,
don't they?
I did screw up.
Okay.
Just so you know, it's your call.
Drink this.
It'll make you feel better.
You're frightened.
It's all right, I understand.
But you don't have to be.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Soon you won't
even be worried anymore.
I promise.
These are just to relax you.
They'll help you get ready.
Now, drink up, okay?
I'll give you a brownie for dessert.
No.
Maia.
They're doing it. They're helping.
Take Dexter south.
Swing back around for another pass.
- Wait, Tom. Stop. Stop.
- What?
It's those butterflies.
They're in Maia's journals.
She's here.
All right, let's go. Secure the area.
Maia.
- What is going on?
- Don't move!
Please.
Please, this house is for sale,
all the valuables are gone.
Is this a dream?
No, honey.
Remember the first time you
were taken away from your parents?
This is where we brought you.
- No, this isn't real.
- Yes, it is.
We've brought you back.
You've been here ever since
you walked through the front door
of my house.
You're in the future.
We had to bring you here, Maia.
You and your friends.
We need your help.
It'll all be over soon.
Please let me go.
I wanna go home.
I'm afraid you can't.
You're too important.
Sweetheart,
the experiment we tried is failing.
There's been too much interference.
The 4400
haven't changed the timeline.
The catastrophe, it's still coming.
We found a way to fix it.
You and your friends,
you're gonna save us all.
We found it all.
You know, the circle, the butterflies.
She's here.
I mean, she has to be here.
Come on, I'll take you home.
Sign here.
Can you sign here?
Thank you, Shawn.
I know this wasn't an easy decision.
Yeah, well,
we all want the same things, right?
You're a good man, Shawn.
It's an honor to be working with you.
Why are you giving this to me?
To thank you.
You did well.
Everything went smoothly
with Shawn.
I disobeyed you, Matthew.
I told Shawn he should keep his job.
I disobeyed you
and you know what?
Nothing happened.
There wasn't an earthquake.
I didn't melt.
I used to be scared of you.
But I don't think you have
any power over me at all, do you?
I didn't think so.
I'll do my own shopping
from now on, okay?
Okay, sweetheart,
we're ready to begin.
Don't cry.
You and the other children
we took,
we tested your abilities
and you are so special.
That's why you were chosen.
Now, here's what's gonna happen.
We're gonna put you all back.
Not the same year
we took you from, but earlier.
Much earlier.
We calculated wrong the first time.
We have to try again.
There's no other way.
There's no other hope for humanity.
I don't care.
I don't wanna go anywhere.
I wanna stay with my mom.
I know.
It's hard.
I can make the pain go away.
Before we put you back
in your new time,
we'll make you forget your mother,
Marco and your friends.
- Please, don't.
- They'll forget you too.
It's better this way.
There'll be no sorrow,
no pain, no loss.
As far as the world is concerned,
you'll just be a girl who disappeared
in 1 946 and was never found.
That's a lie.
My mom won't ever forget me.
She will. It's happening already.
Now, just lie still.
All the hope we have rests with you.
No, don't do it, please.
Mommy!
This should be good.
Durant les 60 dernières années
4400 personnes ont été enlevées...
Toutes sont revenues en même temps.
Sans aucun souvenir d'où elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines sont revenues
avec de nouvelles capacités.
Tous essaient de renouer...
...avec une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le Salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans "les 4400"...
Voici Isabelle.
Vous êtes les garants de notre avenir.
Votre fille est la pierre de Rosette
Permettant de comprendre ce qui
est arrivé aux 4400.
Etes-vous ma mère ?
Ton vieillissement prématuré
a causé son vieillissement.
Le seul moyen pour toi de vivre est que je meurs ?
Ne comprends-tu pas qui tu es ?
Ce que tu dois faire ici ?
I.P...
Inhibiteur de promicine.
C'est nous qui leur avons fait ça, Tom.
Nous les avons rendus malades.
Nous sommes en guerre.
Ceci est un communiqué du Nova Group.
La seconde démonstration de ce dont nous sommes capables
Est prévue pour le 19 octobre.
Tu penses que je vais te signer
un chèque comme ça ?
J'en ai besoin demain.
On n'a pas pu en gérer un seul quand
elle a attaqué ce bâtiment.
Maintenant, il y a une équipe entière
d'assassins, tous dotés d'un don ?
Je vous ai donné de l'argent pour lancer
une défense armée pour le centre
Dans le cas où le gouvernement
en avait encore après nous.
Vous m'avez menti, Daniel.
Il n'a jamais été question de tuer des gens.
Tu nous as piégés.
Tu as fait ce qu'il fallait en nous appelant,
Shawn.
Tu es un héros.
Je suis Tyler.
Maia.
Où sommes-nous ?
C'est ici qu'ils nous ont modifiés...
Qu'ils m'ont donné l'habilité de créer le monde
Dans lequel nous avons vécu ces 8 dernières années.
Quand les gens la regardent,
ils voient une femme,
Et ils pourraient oublier qu'à l'intérieur,
Elle n'est qu'une petite fille.
Je suis heureux qu'elle t'ait à ses côtés,
comme ami.
Tu es chatouilleuse.
Arrête ça !
Ca me gêne.
Ca te gêne ?
Ca n'avait pas l'air de te gêner
il y a quelques minutes.
Je peux te retenir comme ça.
Ah, tu crois ?
Vraiment ?
Et maintenant ?
Ne réponds pas.
Ne réponds pas.
Je suis obligé.
Je suis toujours le boss ici.
Salut, Richard.
Désolé de te déranger.
Je t'attendais dans ton bureau en bas.
Oh, tu sais...
Ouais, désolé.
Je suis un peu en retard ce matin.
Qu'y-a-t'il ?
Avant que Lily...
Avant qu'elle nous quitte,
Elle m'a demandé si je voulais bien
reprendre son travail à la fondation.
Les séances de guérison que tu fais
étaient très importantes à ses yeux.
Je me souviens.
Je suis ravi de te compter parmi nous.
De quoi as-tu besoin ?
D'un meilleur cerveau pour les nombres...
J'essaye de déchiffrer
ces rapports financiers.
Il y a quelques paiements
vraiment élevés.
C'est toi qui as signé les transferts.
Je suppose que tu dois te souvenir
à quoi ils correspondent.
Aucune idée.
Je suis désolé. Aucune idée.
Je vérifiais juste.
A plus tard.
Peut-être que nous devrions lui dire.
Non, non. Je ne pense pas.
On doit juste...
Il faut juste qu'on soit plus
prudents à l'avenir, d'accord ?
Ok.
Merci d'être venu, Thomas.
Je sais qu'une journée porte ouverte au centre
N'est pas ton activité du dimanche préférée.
Je ne dis jamais "non"
à un bon barbecue.
Tu passes pas mal de temps ici.
Si cet endroit est important pour toi,
alors il l'est pour moi aussi.
Je ne te crois mais je t'aime
juste pour avoir dit ça.
Et ne sois pas inquiet :
tout le monde va t'adorer.
Aide-moi à résoudre ça, Tom.
Tu dis aimer Alana.
Pourtant elle est une 4400
Et tu es un agent du NTAC.
Je veux dire... Si j'étais toi
et que je l'aimais vraiment...
Moi, je démissionnerais.
Premièrement, tu n'es pas moi.
Tu ne sais rien du tout de moi.
Tu ne connais rien de notre relation,
et franchement, je doute que tu
connaisses quoique ce soit du NTAC.
Eh bien, vous nous avez quasiment tous tués.
Merci pour l'info, Ryan.
Ravi de t'avoir rencontré.
Je suis vraiment désolée, Thomas.
D'habitude, il n'est pas aussi dur.
Voilà une heure que nous sommes là.
J'ai déjà eu 4 conversations de ce genre.
Tu crois que ça va durer toute la journée ?
Alana ?
Je n'avais pas compris que ton Thomas
était Tom Baldwin.
Tu te souviens de moi ?
Heather Tobey. Oui.
Ravi de voir enfin un visage amical.
- Comment vas-tu ?
- Ca ne peut aller mieux.
Tom a été mon héros.
Tu veux dire qu'Heather faisait partie
de tes assignations ?
Oui. Il y a environ 8 mois.
La fois où j'ai découvert ma capacité.
Heather, tu sembles heureuse.
Que fais-tu maintenant ?
J'enseigne à l'école, ici.
Ca tombe bien, hein ?
J'ai enfin trouvé un endroit où je ne suis pas
mise sur la touche pour être une 4400.
Et maintenant Alana et moi
allons travailler ensemble.
Ce n'est pas génial ?
On m'a offert une place auprès
des enfants à l'école.
Mais je ne suis pas encore décidée.
J'ai gâché la surprise, c'est ça ?
Donc, aide-moi à comprendre...
Qui est Amy déjà ?
Est-elle une 4400 ?
Tout le monde est un 4400
dans ma classe.
Elle veut que je passe la soirée chez elle demain.
Ce n'est pas très important.
Ah bon ?
Eh bien, je suppose que dit comme ça,
je ne peux pas refuser.
Où est ton manteau ?
Je l'ai laissé à l'étage.
Va vite le chercher.
Il fait très froid au bord de la mer.
Nous allons rater le ferry.
Tu vas m'oublier.
Pardon ?
Tu vas m'oublier.
Je l'ai vu.
Maia, pourrais-tu m'expliquer ça,
parce que là, franchement, tu me fais un peu peur.
Ce n'est pas grave.
Ce n'est pas de ta faute.
Maia, écoute-moi.
Jamais je ne t'oublierai.
Jamais.
Voyons. Tu le sais bien, non ?
Je reviens tout de suite.
Ok.
Maia. Allez.
Allez, chérie.
On va vraiment manquer le bateau.
Maia, viens ici tout de suite.
Maman, ça va.
Tout va bien...
- Qui êtes-vous ?
Comment êtes-vous entrée ici ?
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Je ne voulais pas vous faire peur.
Je venais juste de frapper à la porte
lorsque Maia descendait.
C'est génial.
Dis-lui.
Me dire quoi ?
Mme Skouris, je m'appelle Sara.
Sara Rutledge.
Je suis la soeur de Maia.
C'est Lemon.
C'était mon chien.
Je sais. Il dormait sur ton lit, toutes les nuits,
Jusqu'à ce qu'il meurt.
Vous avez vraiment vécu dans ma maison ?
22 White Oak Lane, Crescent City.
Ma chambre était en haut des escaliers.
Je sais. Et c'est toujours ta chambre.
Maman et papa n'y ont pas touché,
juste pour toi.
Tu leur manquais terriblement.
Maia, j'ai besoin que tu me laisses
seule avec Sara pendant un moment.
Est-ce que papa t'a appris à jouer au poker ?
Nous misions des bonbons.
Maia...
Je pense que ta mère a besoin de me parler, mon coeur.
Je suis désolée.
Je ne voulais pas vous déranger.
J'allais laisser un mot.
Je vous ai cherchée pendant des années.
Tous les numéros de téléphone étaient périmés,
Chaque lettre était retournée
à l'expéditeur.
Guyane, la Côte d'Ivoire ?
J'ai été dure à trouver.
"Dure à trouver" ? Je ne savais même pas
si vous étiez vivante ou morte.
Ce qui, je suppose, est...
la raison pour laquelle vous n'avez
jamais parlé à Maia de moi.
Je suis désolée,
Qu'étais-je censée dire ?
"Mon coeur, tu as une grande soeur,
mais il ne semble pas qu'elle soit vraiment
intéressée par l'idée de te rencontrer."
Je suis désolée.
J'aurais dû d'abord appeler.
Je sentais juste que j'avais besoin
de le faire par moi-même.
Je veux juste la connaître.
C'est tout.
Vous pensez que c'est aussi facile ?
Il y a bon nombre de gens qui feraient
n'importe quoi pour approcher un 4400.
Jusqu'à ce que vous puissiez me prouver
que vous êtes qui vous prétendez être,
vous ne reverrez plus ma fille.
Je comprends.
Je veux bien faire un test ADN.
C'est un bon début.
Tu ne m'avais même pas dit
que tu envisageais d'enseigner.
Que cette possibilité existait.
Pour être honnête, j'ai évité de t'en parler.
Je sais ce que tu penses du centre.
Non, je n'ai aucun problème avec le centre.
C'est eux qui en ont avec moi.
Et qu'adviendrait-il de la galerie ?
Je peux continuer à faire tous les achats,
et Tina peux s'occuper des ventes.
Ok, je suis désolée si tout ceci
semble si... soudain. Je...
J'ai parlé de mon don au centre,
Et ils ont pensé que je pourrais
l'utiliser à l'école.
Tu vas utiliser ton don ?
Ne crois-tu pas que c'est pour cette raison
que nous sommes revenus avec ces dons ?
Pour aider les autres ?
Oui, Oui.
Non, ça semble bien.
Je ne pensais pas que...
Je veux dire, est-ce que cela
marche avec d'autres personnes ?
J'ai fait un essai avec Heather.
Nous sommes allées à Paris pour le déjeuner.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Je ne pense pas que mes batteries
vont s'épuiser.
Je garderai le meilleur pour toi.
Promis.
Je voudrais vous remercier d'accepter
de faire partie de notre...
expérience. Je crois qu'on peut l'appeler ainsi.
Nous n'avons jamais essayé une
guérison de cette envergure.
Mais nous pensons que vous serez
tous très heureux des résultats.
Avant de commencer,
je voudrais dire que cette fondation a été lancée
Par ma défunte femme, Lily Tyler.
Je suis fier de poursuivre son travail.
Elle est la raison pour laquelle
nous sommes tous ici aujourd'hui.
Elle, et l'homme que je vais vous présenter...
Shawn Farrell.
Merci.
Ok.
Premièrement,
les enfants,
Je vous promets que ça ne fera pas mal.
Ecoutez, je voudrais vous demander
à tous une faveur.
Quand vous partirez d'ici aujourd'hui,
parce que vous allez quitter l'hôpital
aujourd'hui.
S'il vous plaît, dites à tous ceux
qui vous demanderont,
qu'un 4400 vous a rendu meilleur.
Qu'il a guéri vos enfants.
Nous ne sommes pas des monstres.
Nous sommes ici pour aider.
Donc...
Qu'est-ce qu'on attend pour commencer !
Traître !
Tu as trahi les tiens.
La prochaine fois ce ne sera pas de la peinture !
Ca va ?
Ouais.
C'est dans son dossier.
Les parents de Maia ont eu un bébé 5 ans
après qu'elle disparaisse.
Et elle s'appelait Sara.
Donc c'est possible.
Pas un mot pendant 2 ans,
et soudain elle se pointe comme ça ?
Tu penses que c'est la vraie ?
Je ne sais pas, peut-être.
Qu'est-ce que ton intuition te dit ?
Elle me dit qu'elle ne va pas revoir Maia,
jusqu'à ce que le test ADN soit revenu.
Bonne intuition.
Elle s'appelle Lindsey Hammond.
Elle a disparu le 23 novembre 1979.
Vous savez, juste une fois,
j'aimerais bien qu'un 4400
sourie sur sa photo.
C'est trop demandé ?
Depuis son retour,
elle vivait avec son beau-père.
Jusqu'à hier, en fait.
Quoi, elle a disparu ?
Son beau-père pense qu'elle s'est enfuie.
Faites une descente chez elle,
voir si on a besoin d'être inquiets.
Ca vient juste d'arriver.
L'attaque à l'hôpital ce matin
n'était pas faite au hasard.
D'une façon ou d'une autre tu es devenu
une cible du groupe Nova.
Tu vois une raison ?
Il y a 2 mois...
Quelqu'un m'a appelé.
Ils essayaient de réunir des fonds pour
lancer une branche défensive des 4400.
J'ai fait quelques contributions.
Tu as donné de l'argent au groupe Nova ?
Shawn, ils ont tué
une demi-douzaine de personnes.
Tout ceci est arrivé après coup.
Tu penses vraiment que
je leur aurais donné de l'argent,
si je savais qu'ils allaient
blesser quelqu'un ?
Quand ils sont revenus
pour en demander plus,
je leur ai dit non.
Cet argent, il vient de la fondation, non ?
C'était pour ça toutes ces signatures.
Tu as détourné l'argent de la fondation
de ma femme pour un groupe terroriste ?
Richard, c'était une erreur.
Je sais.
Tu crois que je ne le sais pas ?
Je te l'envoie.
Il faut qu'on garde le volant en
l'air le plus longtemps possible.
Ok ?
Maia...
Où est Maia ?
Elle est chez une copine,
Une fille de sa classe. Pourquoi ?
La recherche ADN nous est revenue.
Ca ne correspond pas.
Sara n'est pas la soeur de Maia.
Où est Maia ?
Elles sont dans le jardin.
Est-ce que tout va bien ?
Maia !
Elle est partie.
Où est-elle allée ?
Elle est partie avec cette femme, sa soeur.
Sa photo est déjà sur le réseau.
Un avis de recherche a été lancé.
On va la trouver, Diana.
Je sais qu'on la trouvera.
On reçoit toutes les caméras
de surveillance de la ville.
On surveille tous les péages,
tous les carrefours possibles.
Si Sara se montre à
n'importe lequel d'entre eux,
on peut y être en quelques minutes.
Tu vas y jeter un coup d'oeil
toi-même, n'est-ce pas ?
Promis.
Ok.
Tom.
Qu'a dit le labo ?
Rien de bon.
Ils ont vérifié les empreintes digitales
de ton appartement,
et les échantillons d'ADN sur tous les listings.
Aucun n'en est sorti.
Alors, elle a Maia.
On n'a aucune idée de qui elle est.
Non.
Elle disait que j'allais l'oublier.
Maman a vraiment laissé ma chambre
comme elle était quand je suis partie ?
Bien sûr.
Elle a toujours cru que
tu allais revenir à la maison.
Maia, est-ce que je peux
te poser une question ?
Tu vois l'avenir plus clairement
depuis que tu as arrêté l'inhibiteur ?
Et bien...
Au début, je ne le contrôlais pas.
J'ai cru que j'allais devenir folle.
Mais maintenant je peux voir l'avenir.
Davantage quand je le veux.
Ca ne me déstabilise plus.
Plus beaucoup, en tout cas.
C'est génial.
Tu apprends à te concentrer sur ton don.
Et si je te demandais de prédire
quelque chose tout de suite ?
Attends.
On peut y aller maintenant.
Tu es vraiment une fille spéciale.
Qu'est-ce que tu en penses ?
C'est ta maison ?
Je l'ai achetée pour pouvoir
rester à Seattle.
On a suffisamment passé de temps séparées,
tu ne crois pas ?
Viens.
Je vais te montrer l'intérieur.
Il y a une surprise.
Ca alors !
C'est exactement comme mon ancienne chambre.
Je te l'ai dit,
maman l'a conservée tel quel.
Sinon, comment le saurais-je ?
Désolé de t'interrompre.
J'espérais pouvoir te parler ?
Matthew...
Rentre.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je suis arrivé dans cette organisation
grâce à Jordan Collier.
Je ne savais pas alors ce qu'il
avait en tête.
Mais je sais qu'il était un homme
d'expérience et un visionnaire.
Six mois après mon arrivée, il est mort.
Mon nouveau patron était alors
un jeune garçon de 19 ans.
C'est à propos de Shawn ?
Il est submergé par tout ça, Richard.
Pour faire tourner ce centre,
il faut prendre des décisions difficiles.
Des décisions pour lesquelles il n'est pas qualifié.
Maintenant, toi, d'un autre côté,
Tu étais officié.
Tu commandais des hommes au combat,
Arrête.
C'est Shawn qui dirige ici.
Je ne suis pas intéressé
pour faire un coup d'état.
Je ne te parle de nous débarrasser de lui.
Je parle de partager le pouvoir.
Vous deux, vous prendriez
les décisions ensemble.
C'est une façon de l'aider.
En tirant bénéfice de ton expérience.
Tout ça est très flatteur.
Je n'essaye pas de te flatter.
J'essaye de maintenir ce mouvement en vie.
Refléchis-y.
Et avant de dire non,
je veux que tu me dises,
Si tu t'imagines,
quelques soient les circonstances,
financer, par inadvertance,
une attaque terroriste.
Ca te rappelle quelque chose ?
Maia en dessine beaucoup
ces derniers jours.
Tu es sûre ?
C'est sur toutes les pages de son journal.
Je ne les ai jamais vues avant.
Mais elle aime bien les papillons.
C'est peut-être juste un gribouillage.
Tu n'as rien trouvé d'autre ?
N'importe quoi dont on puisse se servir ?
C'est difficile à dire.
C'est compliqué de s'y retrouver.
Il y a des prédictions
à propos de gros événements.
Et juste à côté, de toutes petites choses
sur sa vie de tous les jours.
Et aucune date.
J'ai découvert comment j'allais mourir.
C'est intéressant.
Oh, ne t'inquiètes pas.
En fait, c'est assez cool.
Ah si, elle mentionne la maison d'une amie.
Mais elle ne fait référence
qu'à sa mère, Mme Paspalis.
Amy Paspalis ?
C'est la maison où elle a été enlevée.
Super ! Montre-nous cette page.
Ca donne la chair de poule.
Je pourrais passer le reste
de ma carrière sur ce genre de trucs.
Allez, Marco, fais juste...
Là.
Maman va venir me chercher chez Mme Paspalis.
Mais je suis déjà partie.
"Je suis dans un cercle avec Tyler Downing."
Tyler Downing ?
C'est pas un 4400 ?
Il est dans l'école de Maia.
Je vous l'ai déjà dit.
Je n'ai rien fait à Maia. Je le jure !
Ecoute, personne ne pense que
tu aies fait quoique ce soit.
J'ai simplement besoin que
tu essayes de te rappeler.
Maintenant, t'a-t-elle déjà parlé
d'un cercle ?
A-t-elle déjà dit
avoir eu des visions de vous deux ?
Non, je vous l'ai dit au moins dix fois.
Je ne vous mens pas....
Madame, je sais que vous
êtes inquiète pour votre enfant,
mais vous effrayez mon frère.
Diana...
Il n'y a rien ici.
Il n'y a aucune trace de Maia ou de la femme.
"Je suis dans un cercle avec Tyler Downing."
Tyler est là, alors où est Maia ?
Je n'en sais rien.
Si on savait déjà de quoi il était question.
C'est une rue ? Barnaby Circle ?
Il y a un parc circulaire.
Nous devons tous les vérifier,
car elle essaie de me dire comment la retrouver.
Sara...
Est-ce que ma mère va bientôt
venir me chercher ?
Sara ?
Sara, la porte ne veut pas s'ouvrir.
Sara ?
Tu peux crier tant que tu voudras.
Elle ne viendra pas.
Elle ne vient jamais.
Qui es-tu ?
Je suis Lindsey.
Je fais partie de sa collection.
Nous en faisons tous partie.
Toi aussi, maintenant.
Nous sommes tous des 4400.
Que va-t-elle nous faire ?
Nous vendre au plus offrant,
faire des expériences, qui sait ?
Peu importe.
Nous n'allons pas la laisser faire ça.
Y'a quelqu'un ?
C'était incroyable.
Salut.
Oh, salut, Thomas.
Je ne t'ai pas entendu rentrer.
Des nouvelles de Maia ?
Désolée d'envahir ta maison, Tom.
Alana et moi étions juste en train de nous exercer.
Je pense que je devrais prendre
ce travail à l'école.
Heather et moi étions en train
d'essayer quelque chose.
Ne sois pas timide.
Alana vient juste de me ramener
à l'année de ma disparition.
Nous venons de regarder Richard Nixon qui partait
de la Maison Blanche en avion après sa démission.
C'est remarquable, hein ?
Alana est une femme étonnante.
C'est certain.
Tu vas bien, Thomas ?
Bien. Je suis juste...
Je m'inquiète juste pour Diana.
Elle est forte,
et toi aussi.
Quand Heather sera partie, tu veux que
je t'emmène quelque part ?
Ca pourrait te calmer un peu.
Non, je pense que je vais aller dormir.
Je reprends l'enquête au petit matin.
Tout se passe bien
entre toi et Shawn ?
Oui, je pense.
Nous faisons souvent l'amour.
A-t-il enfin dit
"je t'aime" ?
Non.
Tu penses qu'il aurait dû ?
Essaye ça.
Il devrait y avoir un moyen de
mesurer son engagement.
Les hommes peuvent faire avec leur corps des choses
complètement indépendantes de leur coeur et de leur esprit.
Shawn m'apprécie.
C'est réel.
Bien.
Shawn va passer un mauvais moment
durant ces prochains jours.
Il va avoir des décisions à prendre.
Tu dois l'aider à faire le bon choix.
Tu veux que je le manipule ?
Le manipuler ?
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Tu deviens proche de Shawn, non ?
Donc il tiendra à avoir ton avis.
C'est une relation.
Deux personnes qui se font confiance.
Je comprends.
- Que veux-tu que je lui dise ?
- Juste la vérité.
Un leader ne devrait jamais avoir peur
de demander de l'aide.
Ce n'est pas un signe de faiblesse.
C'est une preuve de force.
Mets ça.
Hé, petit...
Essaie de rester calme, ok ?
Je veux rentrer à la maison.
Nous le voulons tous, mais pleurer ne
va pas nous aider.
Ecoute, nous pouvons faire des trucs.
Pas eux.
C'est pour ça qu'ils nous veulent,
mais on peut peut-être s'en servir contre eux.
On peut peut-être trouver un moyen
de nous sortir d'ici.
Vous autres, dites-moi
ce que vous pouvez faire, ok ?
Ma soeur et moi,
nous pouvons faire bouger l'eau.
Aller et venir. Notre maître dit que
nous pouvons provoquer la susdation.
- La sudation.
- Oui.
Mais nous devons être ensemble pour le faire.
Et toi, petit ?
Je fais des trucs avec l'électricité.
Le courant.
Je peux faire en sorte que les machines
de la cuisine s'arrêtent de fonctionner.
Ok, bien.
Ca va sûrement nous servir.
Je peux voir des choses...
Les choses qui vont arriver.
Vraiment ?
C'est impressionnant.
Tu peux dire s'ils vont nous garder ici ?
Ils vont nous laisser partir ?
Allez, dis-nous.
On ne va pas rester ici longtemps.
Pourquoi, on va rentrer chez nous ?
Je ne pense pas.
Désolée d'avoir poser la question.
Ecoutez, je ne sais pas pour vous,
mais je vais essayer de trouver un moyen de
nous faire sortir d'ici.
Alors vous êtes partant ?
Non, laissez-moi partir
Arrêtez ! Laissez-moi !
Aidez-moi !
Laissez-moi !
Au secours !
Laissez-moi partir !
Au secours !
Aidez-moi !
Laissez-moi partir !
Non !
Tyler Downing n'était pas à la maison,
Quand sa soeur est rentrée de son service la nuit dernière.
Mon dieu, c'est le troisième enfant
4400 qui disparaît.
Non, le cinquième.
Les parents d'Olivia et Duncan Germaine pensaient
qu'ils étaient en camping avec sa colonie de vacances.
Il s'avère qu'ils n'y sont pas allés.
Tom, mettez-moi au courant.
Que faisons-nous pour retrouver cette femme ?
Et bien, le journal de Maia disait qu'elle était
à l'intérieur du cercle avec Tyler Downing.
Nous avons vérifié chaque rue
avec "cercle" dans son nom.
Skyline Circle Park, Circle Theater
sur First Hill. Et il n'y a rien.
Et les réservoirs ?
Ils sont circulaires à la base.
Nous avons déjà regardé.
Il y a un cercle de prière prévu
ce matin à Denny Park. Peut-être là.
C'est ici.
Hé, j'ai pensé que tu pouvais avoir
besoin d'un remontant.
Merci.
Pas beaucoup dormi la nuit dernière.
J'en avais besoin, en effet.
Ca aide.
Tu es resté debout toute la nuit ?
Tu devrais aller t'allonger une heure
dans la salle de repos.
Tom...
Diana ?
Tu vas bien ?
Regarde.
"Je suis dans le cercle..."
Je ne le crois pas.
Je vous dis la vérité...
Et vous en profiter pour me jeter dehors.
Non, Shawn.
Je parle seulement de t'aider.
Tu as un travail impossible.
Jordan Collier m'a laissé ce poste.
Durant l'année dernière,
ça a été toute ma vie.
Alors merci pour l'offre,
mais je vais bien.
Le centre a un conseil d'administration,
Shawn,
et ta nomination par Collier
dépend de leur approbation.
Ils l'ont approuvé parce que c'est
ce que voulait Jordan, Matthew.
Franchement, si Jordan était là,
son opinion sur sa succession pourrait changer
s'il savait que tu as financé une
attaque contre le gouvernement américain.
Tu as fait de toi et de cet endroit,
une cible pour les terroristes.
Shawn...
Quand tu es tombé malade à cause
de l'inhibiteur,
Tu m'as demandé de te remplacer.
C'est pareil. Tu as besoin d'aide.
Tu parles comme si tu me
laissais le choix.
- C'est exact.
- Vraiment ?
Parce qu'à cet instant
ça ressemble plus à une menace.
Tyler, parle-nous.
Non.
Si nous sortons de la maison, peux-tu
empêcher les voitures de démarrer ?
Non, je ne vous aiderai pas.
Tu n'as pas vu ce qu'ils ont fait à cette fille ?
Ils l'ont emmenée.
- Je ne veux pas qu'on m'emmène.
- Ca t'arrivera.
C'est ce qui nous arrivera à tous
si nous ne faisons rien !
Lindsey...
Lindsey, tu vas bien ?
Qui es-tu ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils t'ont fait ?
Maia, veux-tu venir avec moi, s'il te plaît ?
Non.
Ca va aller, chérie, ce n'est pas
si terrible, je te le promets.
Au secours !
Tyler ! Duncan ! Pitié !
Que quelqu'un m'aide ! A l'aide !
Le département de police de Seattle prend la rive sud.
Nous, on prend le centre et l'est.
Ce serait bien si je savais ce qu'on recherche.
Un message.
Un signe.
N'importe quoi.
Oh...
Tu aimes ?
Tu me poses vraiment la question ?
Je savais que oui.
Je l'ai choisi spécialement pour toi.
Le vert est ta couleur préférée, c'est ça ?
Je le sais.
Je te connais à présent.
Isabelle. Isabelle...
Je ne suis pas prêt pour un autre round maintenant, ok?
A propos de quoi es-tu si inquiet ?
Si tu ne veux pas partager
ton job, ne le fais pas.
De quoi parles-tu ?
Je peux faire des choses, Shawn.
Enormément de choses.
J'en découvre plus chaque jour.
Si tu veux garder ton job, tu le peux.
Je peux faire en sorte que ça arrive.
Tu peux faire ce que tu veux.
Qui va voir la différence ?
Merci, vraiment.
Mais, euh...
Il faut un peu calmer le jeu.
Nous parlons de ton père et de Matthew.
C'est juste une réclamation.
Ce ne sont pas nos ennemis.
En plus...
Ils ont raison sur un point, non ?
J'ai merdé.
Ok.
Mais sache qu'il ne tient qu'à toi.
Bois ça.
Ca te fera du bien.
Tu es effrayée.
C'est normal. Je comprends.
Mais il ne faut pas.
Nous n'allons pas te faire du mal.
Tu ne seras bientôt plus inquiète.
Promis.
C'est juste pour te détendre.
C'est pour t'aider à te préparer.
Maintenant, avale ça, ok ?
Je te donnerai un brownie pour le dessert.
Non.
Maia...
Ils le font. Ils nous aident.
On va prendre au sud, voir s'il y a d'autres chemins.
Attends, Tom. Arrête-toi. Stop !
Quoi ?
Ces papillons.
Ce sont ceux du journal de Maia.
Elle est ici.
Maia...
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Ne bougez plus !
S'il vous plaît.
S'il vous plaît, cette maison est en vente.
Tous les objets de valeurs ne sont plus là.
Est-ce que c'est un rêve ?
Non, chérie.
Tu te souviens quand on t'a enlevé
à tes parents la première fois ?
C'est ici que l'on t'a emmenée.
Non.
Ce n'est pas réel.
Et si, pourtant.
On t'a ramenée.
Tu es ici depuis que tu as franchi
le seuil de ma porte.
Tu es dans le futur.
On devait t'amener ici, Maia,
toi et tes amis.
On a besoin de votre aide.
Ce sera bientôt fini.
Pitié, laissez-moi partir.
Je veux rentrer chez moi.
J'ai bien peur que non.
Tu es trop importante.
Chérie, l'expérience que
nous avons tentée a échoué.
Il y a eu trop d'interférences.
Les 4400 n'ont pas changé le cours du temps.
La catastrophe, elle arrive toujours.
Nous avons trouvé un moyen de réparer ça.
Toi et tes amis,
vous allez tous nous sauver.
On a tout trouvé.
Le cercle,
les papillons...
Elle est ici.
Enfin, elle doit être là.
Viens, je te ramène chez toi.
Tiens.
Signe ici.
Merci, Shawn.
Je sais que c'était une décision
difficile à prendre.
Eh bien...
Nous voulons tous la même chose, non ?
Tu es un homme bien, Shawn.
C'est un honneur de travailler avec toi.
Pourquoi me donnes-tu ça ?
C'est un merci.
Tu as fait du bon travail.
Tout a marché comme sur des roulettes
avec Shawn.
Je vous ai désobéi, Matthew.
J'ai dit à Shawn qu'il devrait garder son job.
Je vous ai désobéi, et vous savez quoi ?
Rien n'est arrivé.
Il n'y a pas eu de tremblement de terre.
Je n'ai pas disparu.
J'avais peur de vous.
Mais je ne crois pas que vous ayez
le moindre pouvoir sur moi, non ?
Je ne me trompais pas.
J'irai faire les boutiques moi-même
à partir d'aujourd'hui, ok ?
Ok, chérie, nous sommes prêt à commencer.
Ne pleure pas.
Toi et les autres enfants que
nous avons enlevés...
Nous avons testé vos aptitudes,
et vous êtes si spéciaux.
C'est pourquoi nous vous avons choisi.
Maintenant...
Voici ce qui va se passer.
Nous allons tous vous ramener chez vous,
Non pas l'année où l'on vous a enlevés,
mais plus tôt, beaucoup plus tôt.
Nos calculs étaient faux la première fois.
Nous devons réessayer.
Il n'y a pas d'autre moyen.
Il n'y a pas d'autre espoir pour l'humanité.
Je m'en fiche.
Je ne veux aller nulle part.
Je veux rester avec ma mère.
Je sais. C'est dur.
Je ne peux pas faire disparaître la souffrance.
Avant que l'on ne te ramène dans ta nouvelle époque,
nous allons te faire oublier ta mère.
Marco et tes amis.
Pitié, arrêtez.
Et ils vont aussi t'oublier.
C'est mieux comme ça.
Il n'y aura ni peine, ni douleur, ni perte.
Le monde se souviendra de toi,
Comme une petite fille disparue en 1946 et
qui n'a jamais été retrouvée.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Ma mère ne m'oubliera jamais.
Et pourtant si.
C'est déjà en train d'arriver.
Maintenant...
Reste bien allongée.
Vous êtes nos derniers espoirs.
Non...
Ne faites pas ça, s'il vous plaît.
Maman !

A suivre.
Over the last 60 years 4400 people
have been abducted
All at once they were returned
With no memory of where they've been
They haven't aged a day
And some have returned with new abilities
All are trying to reconnect....
...with a life interrupted
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The worldwill have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
this is isabelle.
You are the stewards of the future.
Your daughter is the rosetta stone
for understanding what happened to the 4400.
Are you my mother?
Your rapid aging has caused her rapid aging.
The only way for you to live is for me to die.
Don't you understand who you are,
what you're here to do?
P.I....
promicin inhibitor.
We did it to them,tom.
We made them sick.
We are in a war.
This is a message from the nova group.
The second demonstration of our
capabilities is planned for october 19th.
You think I'm just going towrite you a check?
I need it tomorrow.
We couldn't even handle one when she
walked right in here and attacked the place.
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there all with abilities?
I gave you money to start a defensive
arm for the center
in case the government ever came after us again.
You lied to me,daniel.
You never said anything about killing people.
You sold us out.
You did the right thing by calling us,shawn.
You're a hero.
I'm tyler.
Maia.
Where are we?
This is where they altered us...
gave me the ability to create the world we've
been living in for the last eight years.
People see her,they see a woman,
and they might forget that,inside,
she's just a little girl.
I'm glad she has you around to be a friend.
You are ticklish.
Cut it out.
It bothers me.
It bothers you?
It didn't seem to bother you a few minutes ago.
I could hold you like this.
Oh,you could hold me like this?
Really?
What about that?
don't answer it.
Don't answer.
I have to.
I'm still the boss around here.
Richard,hey.
Sorry to bother you.
I was waiting for you down in your office.
Oh,you know...
yeah,sorry.
I'm just running a little late this morning.
What's up?
Before lily...
um,before she passed,
she asked if I'd take over her job
at the foundation.
The healing work you do was really
important to her.
I remember.
I'm glad to have you aboard.
What do you need?
A better head for numbers.
I've been trying to decipher these
financial reports.
There's some pretty big cash payments.
You signed the transfers.
I figured you might remember what they were for.
no idea.
I'm sorry,no idea.
Just checking.
See you soon.
Maybe we should tell him.
No,no,I don't think so.
We just...
we've just got to be more careful
from now on,okay?
Okay.
Thank you for doing this,thomas.
I know an open house at the center
isn't your favorite sunday activity.
Hey,I love a good barbecue.
You've been spending a lot of time here.
If this place is important to you,
it's important to me.
I don't believe you,
but I love you for saying it,
and don't be nervous.
Everyone here's going to love you,too.
So help me out here,tom.
You say you love alana,
and yet she's a 4400,
and you're an ntac agent.
I mean,if I were you,
and I really loved her,
well,I'd quit that job.
First of all,you're not me.
You don't know anything about me.
You don't know anything about this relationship,
and frankly,I doubt you know much about ntac.
Well, you did almost kill us all.
Thanks for the input,ryan.
Nice chatting with you.
I am so sorry,thomas.
He's usually not that rude.
We've been here an hour.
I've had four conversations like that.
You think we can call it a day?
Alana?
I didn't realize your thomas was tom baldwin.
Remember me?
Heather tobey.
Nice to see a friendly face.
How are you?
I couldn't be better.
Tom was my hero.
you mean heather was one of your assignments?
about eight months ago.
That's when I first got my ability .
Heather,you seem great.
What are you up to?
I teach at the school here now.
It's a good match,huh?
Finally found a place where they won't run me
out on the rails for being a 4400,
and now alana and i are going to be
working together.
Isn't that cool?
I've been offered a job working with
the children at the school.
But I haven't decided if I'm going to take it yet.
I blew the surprise,didn't I?
So help me out here.
Who's amy again?
Is she a 4400?
Everyone in my class is a 4400.
She wants me to come over tomorrow.
It's not a huge deal.
Oh,it's not?
Well,I guess when you put it like that,
then there's no way i can say no.
Where's your sweater?
I left it upstairs.
Quickly run and get it.
It's freezing by the water.
We're going to miss the ferry.
You're going to forget me.
Excuse me?
You're going to forget me.
I saw it.
Maia,do you mind explaining that,
because,frankly,it sounds a little creepy.
It's okay.
It's not your fault.
Maia, listen to me.
I would never forget you.
Not ever.
Come on,you know that,don't you?
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Maia,come on.
Come on,sweetie,
we're going to miss the boat,literally.
Maia,come here right now.
Mommy,it's okay.
-It's fine--
-who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I was just knocking on your door
when maia came upstairs.
It's so great.
Tell her.
Tell me what?
Ms. Skouris,my name is sara.
Sara rutledge.
I'm maia's sister.
It's Lemon.
He was my dog.
I know.
He slept on your bed,every night,
right until he died.
You really lived in my house?
22 white oak lane,crescent city.
My room was at the top of the steps.
I know.
It was always your room.
Mom and dad kept it all the same,just for you.
They missed you so much.
Maia,I need you to give me some time alone
with sara.
Did daddy teach you to play poker?
We played for tootsie rolls.
Maia...
I think your mom needs a word with me,sweetie.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to sandbag you.
I was going to leave a note.
I haven't tried to find you for years.
Every phone number out of date,
every letter comes back "return to sender."
Guyana,the ivory coast?
I've been hard to find.
"Hard to find". I even knew if you were alive or dead.
Which,I'm guessing,is...
is why you never told maia about me.
I'm sorry,
what was I supposed to say?
"Sweetheart, you have an older sister,
"but it doesn't seem like she's terribly
interested in meeting you?"
I'm sorry.
I should have called first.
I just felt like i needed to do this in person.
I just want to know her.
That's all.
You think it's that easy?
There are a lot of people who would do anything to get close to a 4400.
Until you can prove to me that you are
who you say you are,
you're not seeing my daughter again.
I understand.
I'm willing to take a dna test.
It's a good start.
You didn't even tell me you were thinking
about teaching,
that the possibility existed.
To be honest,I was avoiding it.
I know how you feel about the center.
No, I'm fine with the center.
They're not fine with me.
What about your gallery?
I can still do all the buying,
and tina can handle sales.
Okay,I'm sorry if this seems just-- sudden.I...
I told them about my ability at the center,
and they thought they could use it at the school.
You're going to use your ability?
Don't you think that's why we came back here
with these gifts?
To help other people?
Yeah, Yeah.
No,it sounds great.
I just didn't think that...
I mean,does it even work with other people?
I did an experiment with heather.
We went to paris for lunch.
Don't worry,
I don't think my batteries run out.
I'll save my best work for you.
I promise.
I'd like to thank you for agreeing
to be a part of our...
experiment,I guess you'd call it.
We've never tried a healing this large,
but we think you'll all be very happy
with the results.
Before we begin,
I'd like to say that this foundation was
started by my late wife,lily tyler.
I'm proud to be carrying on her work.
She's the reason why we're all here today.
her,and the man i'm about to introduce to you...
shawn farrell.
Thank you.
Okay
,first off,
kids,
I promise this is not going to hurt.
listen,I'd like to ask everyone here a favor.
When you leave here today--
and you will be leaving the hospital today--
please tell anyone that asks
that a 4400 made you better,
Made you children better.
because we're not bogeymen.
We're here to help.
So...
let's get this thing started.
Traitor!
You betrayed your own kind.
Next time it won't be paint!
You okay?
Yeah.
It's in her file.
Maia's parents had a baby five years after
she disappeared,
and her name was sara.
so it is possible.
No word at all for two years,
and then she just shows up?
You think she's the real deal?
I don't know,maybe.
What does your gut tell you?
it tells me that she's not going to see
maia again
until the dna tests comes back.
Smart gut.
Her name is lindsey hammond.
She disappeared on november 23,1979.
You know,just once,
I wish a 4400 would smile for their picture.
Is that too much to ask?
Since her return,
she's been living with her stepfather.
Until yesterday,that is.
What,she's missing?
her stepfather thinks she ran away.
Take a drive out to her house,
see if we need to be worried.
That just came in.
The attack at the hospital this mornig
Wasn't random.
Somehow you've become a target of the nova group.
Any idea why?
Two months ago...
someone called me.
They were trying to raise money to start
a defensive wing of the 4400.
I made a couple of contributions.
You gave money to the nova group?
Shawn,they murdered half a dozen people.
That was after.
Do you really think i would have given them money
if I thought that they were going to hurt anybody?
When they came back asking for more,
I said no.
You got the money from the foundation,didn't you?
That's what all those signatures were for.
You diverted money from my wife's foundation
to a terrorist group?
Richard,it was a mistake.
I know that.
Don't you think I know that?
I'll serve to you.
We have to try to keep it going for
as long as we can.
Okay?
Maia...
where's maia?
She's at a friend's house--
a girl from the class. Why?
Preliminary dna came back.
Negative match.
Sara isn't maia's sister.
Where's maia?
They're in the yard.
I-is everything okay?
Maia!
She left.
Where did she go?
She went with that lady, her sister.
Her picture's already on the wire.
An amber alert's been issued.
We'll find her,diana.
I know we will.
We're tapped into every surveillance
camera in the city downstairs.
We're monitoring every toll booth,
every intersection we can.
If sara shows up on any of them,
we can be there in minutes.
You're going to keep an eye on things
yourself,right?
you got it.
Okay.
Tom.
What did the lab say?
Nothing good.
They ran the fingerprints from your apartment,
and the dna samples against every known database.
No names came up.
So she has maia.
We have no idea who she is.
No.
She said i was going to forget her.
Mom really kept my room just like I left it?
Sure she did.
She always believed that you were going
to come home.
Maia,can I ask you a question?
Do you see the future more clearly since
you stopped taking the inhibitor?
Well...
at first,I couldn't control it.
I thought i was going crazy,
but now i can see the future,
more when I want to.
It doesn't really sneak up on me anymore.
Not much,anyway.
That's great.
You're learning to focus your ability.
What if I asked you to predict something
right now?
Wait.
We can go now.
You are a very special girl.
What do you think?
This is your house?
I bought it so I can stay in seattle.
We've spent enough time apart,
don't you think?
Come on.
Let me show you the inside.
There's a surprise.
Oh my gosh.
It's just like my old room.
I told you mom kept it the same.
Else how would I know?
Sorry to interrupt--
hoping i could have a word?
Matthew...
come on in.
What's on your mind?
I was brought into this organization
by jordan collier.
I didn't always know what he had
in mind for it,
but I did know that he was a man
of experience and vision.
Six months after i came aboard,he died.
My new boss was a 19-year-old boy.
This is about shawn?
He's overwhelmed,richard.
Running this center requires substantive
decisions,
decisions that he's not qualified to make.
Now,you,on the other hand,
you were an officer.
You led men into battle--
stop.
Shawn runs things here.
I am not interested in a palace coup.
I am not talking about getting rid of him.
I'm talking about power sharing.
The two of you make decisions together.
It's a way of helping him,
giving him the benefit of your experience.
This is all very flattering.
I'm not trying to flatter you.
I'm trying to keep this movement alive.
Think about it.
And before you say no,
I want you to tell me,
could you,under any circumstances,
see yourself inadvertently funding
a terrorist attack?
Look familiar?
Maia's been drawing it a lot the last few days.
Are you sure?I mean,it's all through
the margins of her journals.
I've never seen it before,
but she likes butterflies.
It might just be a doodle.
Did you find anything else,
anything we can use?
It's hard to say.
I mean,it's all stream of consciousness.
You know,predictions about big events
right next to tiny things in her everyday life,
and there's no dates.
I did find out how I'm going to die.
that was interesting.
Oh,don't worry.
It's actually kind of cool.
,she did mention a friend's house.
Just referred to the mom,though,mrs. Paspalis.
Amy paspalis?
That's the house she was taken from.
Great,show us that page.
Spooky.
I could spend the rest of my career
working on these things.
Come on,marco,just...
here.
Mom is coming to pick me up for Mrs Paspalis's House.
But I'm already gone."
I'm in a circle with tyler downing."
Tyler downing?
Isn't he a 4400?
He goes to school with maia.
I told you,
I didn't do anything to maia.I swear!
Look,nobody thinks
that you did anything.
I just need you
to try and remember.
Now,did she ever talk to you
about a circle?
Did she ever mention having visions about the two of you
no,I said already 10 times.
I'm not lying--
ma'am,I know you're worried about your kid.
You're scaring the crap out of my brother.
Diana...
there's nothing here.
There's no sign of maia or the woman.
"I'm in the circle with tyler downing."
Tyler's here,so where is maia?
I don't know.Maybe if we knew what circle
she was talking about.
Is it a street? Barnaby circle?
There's a circle park--
well,we need to check them all,
because she's trying to tell me how to find her.
sara...
is my mom coming
to pick me up soon?
Sara?
Sara,the door won't open.
Sara?
You can yell
all you want.
She won't come.
She never does.
Who are you?
I'm lindsey.
I'm a part of her collection.
We all are.
Now you are,too.
All of us are 4400s.
What is she
going to do to us?
Sell us to the highest bidder,
do experiments,I mean,who knows?
It doesn't matter.
We're not going to let it come to that.
Hello?
That was incredible.
Hi.
Oh,hi,thomas.I didn't hear you
come in.
Any word about maia?
Sorry to invade your house,tom.
Alana and i were just practicing.
I think I might take that job at the school.
Heather and I were just trying something.
Don't be shy about it.
Alana just took me back
to the year I disappeared.
We just watched richard nixon fly away
from the white house after he resigned.
That's remarkable,huh?
Well,alana's an amazing woman.
She certainly is.
Are you all right,thomas?
Fine.I'm just...
I'm just worried for diana.
She's strong,
and so are you.
After heather leaves, you want to me to take you somewhere.
it might calm you down some.
No,I think I'm just going to
go to sleep,
hit the investigation fresh
in the morning.
So things are going well
between you and shawn?
Yeah,I think so.
We're having lots of sex.
Has he said
"I love you" yet?
No.
Do you think he should have?
Try this.
It would be a way to gauge
the level of his involvement.
Men can do things with their bodies
entirely unrelated to their hearts and minds.
Shawn likes me.
It's real.
Good.
Shawn's going to be having
a difficult time these next few days.
He's going to have
some decisions to make.
You need to help guide him
toward the right choice.
You want me to use him?
Use him?
What does that even mean?
You're getting close to shawn,right?
So he'll value your advice.
That's a relationship.
That's two people trusting each other.
I guess.
- What do you want me to say to him?
- Just the truth.
A leader should never be afraid
to ask for help.
It's not a sign of weakness.
It's a display of strength.
Wear that.
Hey,kid...
you have to try
to be quiet,okay?
I just want to go home.
We all do,but crying is not
going to help.
Listen,we can do stuff.
They can'T.
That's why they want us,
but maybe we can use it against them.
Maybe we could figure out a way
to get us out of here.
Everyone,tell me
what you can do,okay?
My sister and me,
we can make water move.
Back and forth.Our teacher says
we can make dis-fusion happen.
- Diffusion.
- Yeah.
We have to be together to do it,though.
What about you,kid?
I do stuff with electricity.
Currents.
I can make machines
in my kitchen stop working.
Okay,good,
that will come in handy.
I can see things,
things that are going to happen.
Really?
That's awesome.
Can you tell if they're going to
keep us here?Are they going to let us go?
Come on,tell us.
We're not going to be here long.
Why,do we get to go home?
I don't think so.
Sorry I asked.
Listen,I don't know
about the rest of you,
but I'm going to try to figure out a way
to get us out of here.
So are you guys up for it?
No,let me go!
Stop! Let me go!
Stop it!
Let me go!
Help me!
Let me go!
Help me !
Let me go!
Help!
Help me!
Let me go!
No!
Tyler downing wasn't home when his sister
got back from her waitressing shift last night.
My god,that's the third
4400 kid missing.
No,try five.
Olivia and duncan germaine's parents thought they
went on a camping trip with their youth group.
Turns out they never showed.
Tom,update me here.
What are we doing to find this woman?
Well,maia's journal said
she was inside the circle with tyler downing.
We've checked out every street
with the name "circle" in it.
Skyline circle park, circle theater
on first hill. And there's nothing yet.
What about the reservoirs?
They're basically circular.
We've already looked.
There's a prayer circle scheduled
this morning in denny park.Maybe there.
It's over here.
Hey,I thought
you could use a jolt.
Thanks.
Didn't get
much sleep last night.
Any,actually.
This helps.
You were up all night?
You should go lie down
in the theory room for an hour.
Tom...
diana,
you're all right?
Look.
"I'm in the circle..."
I don't believe this.
I tell you the truth...
and you use it
to kick me out.
No,shawn.
I'm just talking about helping you.
You've got an impossible job.
Jordan collier left me in charge
of this place.
For the past year and a half,
it has been my entire life.
So thank you for the offer,
but I am good.
The center has a board of directors,
shawn,
and collier's appointment of you
is subject to their ongoing approval.
They approved it because that's what
jordan wanted,matthew.
Frankly,if jordan was here,
his thoughts on succession might change
if he knew you bankrolled an attack
on the united states government.
You've made yourself,and this place,
a target for terrorists.
Shawn...
when you got sick
from the inhibitor,
you asked me to pinch-hit for you.
It's like that.You need help.
You're talking like
you're offering me a choice.
- I am.
- Really?
Because right now
it sounds like a threat.
Tyler,you have to talk to us.
No.
If we get out of the house,
can you make it so their cars can't start?
No,I'm not helping.
Didn't you see what they did
to that other girl? They took her away.
- I don't want to go away.
- You will.
We all will if we don't do something.
Lindsey...
lindsey,are you okay?
Who are you?
What did they do to you?
Maia,do you want to come with me,please?
No.
It's okay,sweetie,it's not so bad.I promise.
Help!
Tyler! Duncan!Please!
Somebody help me! Help!
Seattle pd has the south edge.
We'll take center and work east.
It'd be nice if I knew what we were looking for.
A message.
A sign.
Anything.
Oh...
do you like this?
You're seriously asking?
I knew you would.
I picked it out just for you.
Green's your favorite color,isn't it?
I can tell.
I know you now.
Isabelle.Isabelle...
I'm not really ready for another
round right now,okay?
What are you so worried about?
If you don't want to share your job,don't.
What are you talking about?
I can do things,shawn.
Lots of them.
I figure out more every day.
If you want to keep your job,you can.
I can make it happen.
You can do whatever.
Who's going to say different?
Thanks,I guess,
but,uh...
just hold off on the air strikes,okay?
We're talking about your dad
and matthew here.
It's just an argument.
They're not the enemy.
Besides...
they do have a point,don't they?
I did screw up.
Okay.
Just so you know,it's your call.
Drink this.
It'll make you feel better.
You're frightened.
It's all right,I understand,
but you don't have to be.
We're not going to hurt you.
Soon,you won't even be worried anymore,
I promise.
These are just to relax you.
They'll help you get ready.
Now,drink up,okay?
I'll give you a brownie for dessert.
No.
Maia...
They're doing it.They're helping.
We'll take dexter south,swing around
for another pass.
Wait,tom. Stop. Stop!
What?
Those butterflies.
There 're in Maia'journals.
She's here.
Maia...
what is going on?
Don't move!
Please.
Please,this house is for sale.
All the valuables are gone.
Is this a dream?
No,honey.
Remember the first time you were
taken away from your parents?
This is where we brought you.
No.
This isn't real.
Yes,it is.
We've brought you back.
You've been here ever since you
walked through the front door of my house.
You're in the future.
We had to bring you here,maia,
you and your friends.
We need your help.
That will be over soon.
Please, let me go.
I want to go home.
And i'm afraid you can't
You're too important.
Sweetheart, the experiment we tried is failing
There's been too much interference
The 4400 haven't changed the timeline.
The catastrophe,it's still coming.
We've found a way to fix it.
You and your friends,
you're going to save us all.
We found it all.
The circle,
the butterflies...
she's here.
I mean,she has to be here.
Come on,I'll take you home.
Here.
Sign here.
Thank you,shawn.
I know this wasn't an easy decision.
Well..
We all want the same things, right?
you're a good man,shawn.
It's an honor to be working with you.
Why are you giving this to me?
It's a thank you.
You did well.
Everything went smoothly with shawn.
I disobeyed you,matthew.
I told shawn he should keep his job.
I disobeyed you,and you know what?
Nothing happened.
There wasn't an earthquake.
I didn't melt.
I used to be scared of you,
but I don't think you have any
power over me at all,do you?
I didn't think so.
I'll do my own shopping from now on,okay?
Okay,sweetheart,we're ready to begin.
Don't cry.
You and the other children we took,
we tested your abilities,
and you are so special.
That's why you were chosen.
Now...
here's what's going to happen.
We're going to put you all back--
not the same year we took you from,
but earlier,much earlier.
We calculated wrong the first time.
We have to try again.
There's no other way.
There's no other hope for humanity.
I don't care.
I don't want to go anywhere.
I want to stay with my mom.
I know.It's hard.
I can make the pain go away.
Before we put you back in your new time,
we'll make you forget your mother,
marco,and your friends.
Please don'T.
They'll forget you,too.
It's better this way.
There'll be no sorrow,no pain,no loss.
As far as the world is concerned,
you'll just be a girl who disappeared
in 1946 and was never found.
That's a lie.
My mom won't ever forget me.
She will.
It's happening already.
Now...
just lie still.
All the hope we have rests with you.
No...
don't do it,please.
Mommy!

To Be Continued
Durant les 60 dernières années
4400 personnes ont été enlevées...
Toutes sont revenues en même temps.
Sans aucun souvenir d'où elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines sont revenues
avec de nouvelles capacités.
Tous essaient de renouer...
...avec une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le Salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans "les 4400"...
Je vois que tu passes pas mal de
temps avec Shawn.
Les gens la voient comme une femme,
une belle femme,
mais ils pourraient oublier qu'à l'intérieur
elle n'est qu'une petite fille.
Je suis heureux qu'elle t'ait à ses côtés
comme ami.
Vous avez tué des gens. Ce n'est pas
ce dont nous avions parlé.
Nous sommes en guerre.
Cela va coûter beaucoup d'argent.
Tu nous as piégé.
Je suis très déçu, Shawn.
J'ai peur de ne pouvoir te pardonner.
Diana Skouris, votre adoption de Maia Rutledge
est à présent complète, légale et définitive.
Mme Skouris, mon nom est Sara.
Je suis la soeur de Maia.
Vois-tu plus clairement le futur
depuis que tu as arrêté de prendre l'inhibiteur ?
Qui es-tu ?
- Je m'appelle Lindsey.
Je fais partie de sa collection.
Comme nous tous ici.
Tyler ! Duncan !
Tu es entrée ici au moment où tu as
mis les pieds dans ma maison.
Tu es dans le futur.
Nous devions te ramener, Maia, toi et tes amis.
Avant de te renvoyer à votre époque,
nous allons te faire oublier ta mère.
Je vous en prie, ne faites pas ça.
Ils t'oublieront eux aussi.
Salut.
Oh, Marco. Elles sont magnifiques.
Comment savais-tu que
j'aimais les anémones ?
Tu te souviens de ce mauvais restaurant italien ?
Je t'ai demandé quelles étaient tes fleurs préférées,
et tu as répondu...
Les anémones.
La plupart des mecs n'écoute même
pas les conversations de restaurant.
Toi, tu écoutes et en plus tu te souviens.
Sais-tu combien tu vas être chanceux ce soir ?
Ah, c'est donc que mon plan fonctionne.
Je pensais qu'il n'y aurait que nous deux.
C'est le cas.
Alors pour qui est la troisième assiette ?
Di ?
Je ne sais pas à quoi j'ai pensé.
Tu t'amuses ?
- Bien sûr que je m'amuse.
Tu es sûre que tu ne veux pas prendre le volant ?
- C'est ton rêve.
Ok, chérie. Accroche-toi !
Attention !
Ca va ?
- Je crois, oui.
Tu l'as vu aussi, hein ?
- Bien sûr que oui.
Pourquoi une petite fille se retrouverait-elle
en plein sur la route ?
Je n'en sais rien.
On avait dit "une ballade dans la régoin", non ?
Une voiture géniale, une route déserte.
Percuter une gamine à 130 km/h...
Ca vient d'où ça ?
Que lui est-il arrivé ?
Thomas...
Eh !
Eh ! eh...
Eh...
Ca va ?
Qui était-elle ?
Aucune idée.
Combien de fois est-on déjà partis tous les deux
dans un de ces mondes que tu crées ?
Une douzaine de fois ?
Deux douzaines ?
Au moins.
- Et ces mondes semblent toujours réels.
Sauf que cette fois, une fille sans visage
arrive de nulle part.
C'était plus un cauchemar.
Une telle chose allait
arriver un jour ou l'autre.
Je contruis ces mondes
sur la base de nos souvenirs.
Je pense que ce coup-ci,
j'ai révélé quelque chose d'incomplet.
Un fragment, une sorte de sursaut mental.
Ok, mais cette fille, fait-elle partie de ma
mémoire ou de la tienne ?
De la mienne, la tienne, des deux...
Il n'y aucun moyen de savoir, n'est-ce pas ?
L'un de nous aurait pu voir sa photo dans un livre
ou la voir dans la rue.
Son visage ne me dit rien.
Cela pourrait n'être qu'un coup d'oeil.
Un coup d'oeil qui a bien ruiné notre soirée.
Eh bien, ce sera mieux demain soir,
je te promets.
L'endroit où tu veux, où nous voulons
et y faire ce que nous voulons.
Pour ses 12 ans, j'ai emmené Kyle pêcher
à la rivière Dosewallips.
Peut-être que tous les 3, nous pourrions y aller.
Ca me paraît génial.
Et peut-être que cette fois, nous pourrons
vraiment attraper quelque chose.
Ok.
Je sais pas.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas avec ma chambre ?
Ou la tienne d'ailleurs.
On l'a déjà fait plein de fois dans nos chambres.
Les experts disent qu'il faut tenter des choses
inhabituelles afin de garder le piment d'une relation.
Ah ils disent ça ?
Qu'y-a-t-il de plus inhabituel
que de le faire rapidement dans l'escalier ?
Tu es passé de l'encyclopédie Britannica
à Cosmopolitan ou un truc dans le genre ?
J'ai lu pas mal de choses.
Je vais prendre l'ascenseur.
Devon...
Ca l'a mise mal à l'aise.
Isabelle, arrête.
Qu'y-a-t-il Shawn ? Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Elle ne va rien dire à mon père.
Elle a trop peur de moi.
- Isabelle.
Elle va le dire à quelqu'un,
qui va le dire à quelqu'un d'autre,
et à la fin tout le monde va le savoir.
Où est ta partenaire ?
En retard.
Un 4400, Christopher Dubov, a été attaqué
devant chez lui la nuit dernière.
Je veux savoir s'il s'agit d'un crime de haine.
Il est dit ici que c'est un avocat de chez
Teller & Dutch.
C'est une importante firme
de fusions et acquisitions
Ils font les beaux jours de la presse
financière cette année.
Ce qui fait de lui un 4400 haut placé. Une cible
facile pour quelqu'un voulant se faire entendre.
C'est surtout un important chef d'entreprise
assurant l'emploi de beaucoup de gens.
Le fait qu'il soit un 4400 n'est pas le seul motif
pour lequel il peut être attaqué.
Laisse-moi lui parler. Voir si il peut t'écrire
sur une liste.
La minuterie du réveil a-t-elle
besoin de nouvelles batteries ?
Non, c'est une sale matinée.
Tu dois exposer une nouvelle représentation ?
Non, juste un... projet, je travaille dessus.
Alors, qu'est-ce nous avons ?
Oui, tu peux appeler ça un crime de haine.
Mon fils Michael
me déteste certainement.
Votre fils n'est-il pas au courant
à propos de vous, Mr. Dubov ?
Sa mère et moi nous nous sommes séparés.
Il me blâme.
Je suis le seul qui me suis introduit
dans sa vie avec Bob, son nouveau mari.
Je savais qu'ils allaient bien ensemble.
Je peux sentir ça.
- Je ne suis pas sûr que je te suive.
- C'est ma capacité.
C'est révélé une fois que j'ai stoppé
la prise de promicine inhibitrice.
Je peux sentir les phéromones.
Vous voulez dire la matière des personnes qui
s'attire chez d'autres personnes ?
Etrange, hum ?
Le choses entre ma femme et moi n'ont pas
été avantageuses pendant quelque temps.
Après j'ai rencontré Bob.
Il était mon nouveau dentiste.
Tout de suite, il n' y a eu quelque
chose de similaire avec lui.
Ensuite j'ai réalisé ce que c'était.
Il sentait juste comme Caroline.
Alors j'ai obtenu
un rendez-vous avec elle.
J'ai su si ou pas
ils allaient bien ensemble.
Laissez-moi deviner,
l'amour à première vue.
La vue, l'odorat,
quelque soit la chose.
Toi et ton fils sembler très heureux ensemble.
Ceux qui ont été pris
quand Michael avait 10 ans.
10 ans...
C'est un...
C'est un formidable âge.
Mr. Dubov...
Voulez-vous nous parler de Michael ?
Un assault est un sérieux crime ?
Oubliez ça. Je suis désolé que
ma secrétaire vous est appelée.
De plus, je pense que je connais une solution pour me
rattraper et me pardonner. Il y a un nouveau bar au coin.
Une des serveuses, elle est capable
de sentir juste comme mon fils .
- Espérons qu'elle ne soit pas mariée.
- Ainsi soit-il pour cela.
Tu sais, je parie que si ce gars quitte son boulot et ouvre
un service de rencontre amoureuse, il se fait une fortune.
Cependant, je ne suis pas sûr comment la critique d'un avocat
moral aussi cupide veut aider à sauver le future.
Hé...
Chérie, que se passe-t-il ?
Tu vas bien ?
Dubov est parti il y a de cela
5 ans, n'est-ce pas ?
Je...
Je parie que son fils a vraiment disparu.
Probablement.
Je veux dire que chaque 4400
laisse quelqu'un derrière.
Es-tu sûr que ce n'est pas
quelque chose d'autre ?
Non...
Ca va, vraiment.
Ca devrait passer.
Ok...
Physiquement...
Toi et Isabelle.
Tu veux m'expliquer ça ?
Je t'ai posé une question ! Que s'est-il
exactement passer entre toi et ma fille ?
Nous n'avons jamais plannifié
cela derrière ton dos.
En fait, nous n'avons jamais plannifié tout cela.
C'est juste quelque chose qui s'est passée.
L'amitié !
Souviens-toi, nous en parlions.
C'était aussi loin de supposer
que s'allait arriver.
Je ne sais pas quoi dire, je suis désolé.
Je suis désolé, moi aussi. Je suis désolé
je n'aurai jamais dû te faire confiance.
Isabelle est juste un enfant.
Non, Richard, elle ne l'est pas.
Elle est émotionellement immature,
et tu tires avantage de cela !
C'est ce que tu penses ? Tu me connais
mieux que cela. Ce n'est pas certain.
Je pense que ton jugement que tu penses
comprendre vienne de ma fille.
Je ne suis pas venu pour avoir ta promesse.
Je vais te donner qu'un unique choix,
tu me comprends ?
Cette chose entre vous deux,
c'est terminée.
Je ne t'ai pas rappeler
en disant "entrer."
Je pensais peut-être qu'un arbitre
pourrait rétablir l'ordre.
Peut-être puis-je conseiller ce monsieur
de se diriger vers un coin neutre ?
C'est une conversation privée, Matthew.
Cela peut paraître être sur une bonne voie,
mais je t'assure, cela commence à devenir très public.
je peux t'entendre d'en dehors du couloir,
et pour le rapport, je suis d'accord avec Richard.
Cette relation avec Isabelle
est peu judicieuse au mieux.
Je pensais que les arbitres
ne prennaient pas parti.
Si je suis avec toi, Shawn, c'est que je dois prendre
cette opportunité de réussir une sortie élégante.
Pense à ce que je t'ai dit, Shawn.
Je ne peux pas decider à ta place
pour faire le bon choix.
Qu'est-ce qu'on a pour le repas ?
Prosciutto avec des figues.
Poulet au ramarin, couscous,
et des framboises.
Tu sais, quand Kyle et moi allons pêcher, nous
prenons une doze de beurre de cacahuètes et une
gelée de sandwiches et en pensant vivre comme des rois.
Eh bien, j'aime à penser que la réalité que je
crée est une petit avant-goût, plus que cela.
Bien.
Hé, nous devrions venir.
Hé, Kyle !
Viens, Buddy !
Bouge-toi !
Viens...
C'est toi.
La fille sur la route.
C'est correct.
Tu t'en souviens.
Maia.
Maia...
Nous sommes-nous rencontrés avant ?
Ne soit pas si stupide.
Non, non, Je suis désolé.
Je...Je ne me souviens pas de toi.
Es-tu sûr de cela ? Pense plus fort.
Et pourquoi tu n'es pas présentée ?
Parce que tu veux que je m'en souvienne ?
Je suis ici parce que tu m'as élevé ici.
Il doit y avoir une raison, pourquoi cette fille
se réserve-t-elle de se dévoiler.
Il n'y a rien de familier à propos d'elle ?
Rien de tout cela ?
Non...
Mais elle s'est gardée d'agir comme nous
connaissons chacun d'eux,
Et elle a raison si je devais lui apporter là,
après je devrai savoir d'où ça vient.
Tom...
Ne devrais-tu pas être au travail ?
Jarvis dit que tu as appelé en étant malade.
Eh bien, j'en tiendrai compte.
Merci de me mettre à la consigne.
Viens, Diana. Parle-moi.
Qu'es-tu...
Qu'est-ce que c'est que tout ça ?
C'est juste un projet sur lequel je travaille.
Je t'ai mentionné dessus.
- Qui s'est supposer être ?
- Je souhaite le savoir.
Je sais que cela peut paraître être un son qui donne
la chair de poule, mais j'étais debout toute la nuit.
La nuit dernière en passant en revue les photos des
petites filles, et pas une d'elles ne semblent être la bonne.
Je pense que je suis en
train de devenir fou.
Alors nous sommes deux.
Tu sais que ces petites
rêvent de ces vacances que je prends avec Alana ?
Cette petite fille se garde de dévoiler l'un d'eux.
Cette petite fille blonde,
dit que... son nom est Maia.
Maia...
- Oh, Tom...
- Quoi ?
Tu dois venir avec moi, Tom..
Je dois te montrer quelque chose.
Qui est-elle, Tom ?
Qui est Maia ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il n'est pas question d'une personne
appelée Maia dans aucun de nos dossiers.
Ok, peut-être que nous l'avons rencontrée ensemble
ailleurs.
Peut-être à un des barbecues de Garrity.
Non, ce n'est pas ça. Je n'ai pas simplement
rencontré cette fille une fois à un barbecue.
Je la connais mieux que ça.
D'accord. Reste calme.
Bien, il y a une raison pour que cette
fille nous hante, Tom.
Ok, elle est quelque part dehors,
et elle veut que nous la trouvions.
Pour l'instant, le seul endroit où je sais qu'elle existe
est l'un de ces mondes qu'Alana et moi créons.
J'ai besoin qu'Alana m'y emmène.
J'ai besoin de rencontrer cette fille, de lui parler.
Mais tu ne lui parleras pas réellement, Diana.
Tu parlerais à ce dont ton
subconscient se souvient d'elle.
Peut-être que ça me suffira
pour découvrir qui elle est.
De quoi j'ai l'air ?
Comme si tu jouais depuis des années.
Mais ce n'est pas le cas.
C'est ma première fois.
Je n'en est pas eu l'impression.
Isabelle, tu as une minute ?
Assieds-toi.
Isabelle, tu sais que je suis fier de toi ?
C'est à propos du fait que Shawn
et moi avons fait l'amour ?
En ... en partie, oui, oui.
Mais seulement en partie.
En ce moment, tout est nouveau pour toi.
Tu apprends tellement, si vite.
Comment être une ...
une fille ...
- une amie ...
- une petite amie.
Cette partie tu l'apprends un peu trop vite ...
Tu ne veux pas que je sois
blessée sentimentalement ?
J'aimerais seulement que Shawn
et toi ralentissiez ...
- Arrêter de dormir ensemble ?
- Pour le moment.
Il n'y a aucune raison d'arrêter.
Shawn s'intéresse à moi.
Je m'intéresse à Shawn.
Le sexe est fantastique.
Ca nous rend tous les deux très heureux.
Ca pourrait te rendre plus joyeux, toi aussi.
Ca pourrait, mais ce n'est pas le cas.
Je pense que c'est normal.
Mais tout va redevenir bien.
Shawn ne ferait jamais rien qui puisse me blesser.
Il est trop intelligent pour ça.
Tu vois ? Tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter pour ça.
Je me demande si quelqu'un au centre a un violoncelle.
Bon, que dois-je faire ?
- Le principal est de se relaxer.
- Oh, mon dieu.
J'ai l'habitude de fermer les yeux et
de compter à rebours à partir de 10.
Avant d'être arrivé à zéro,
nous sommes ailleurs.
Tu as une idée de l'endroit où tu veux
qu'Alana t'emmène ?
D'habitude nous choisissons une destination.
Bien, où est Maia.
Je veux dire, tu peux faire ça, non ?
Tu peux me mener à elle ?
Elle semble se montrer où que nous allions.
Donc c'est à toi de décider.
D'accord, eh bien, restons simples.
Que diriez-vous de mon appartement ?
D'accord.
Maintenant, allons-y.
Alana...
Ce n'est pas mon appartement.
Je sais. Je ne suis pas trop sûre de
ce qu'il vient de se passer.
Tu as fini de parler avec ton amie ?
- Tu es Maia.
- Arrête de faire l'idiote.
Viens. Il nous attend.
Vous voici,
Melle Skouris.
Les documents sont tous prêts.
Si vous voulez bien vous asseoir et
signer où c'est indiqué, nous pourrons en finir.
Consentement du tuteur à l'adoption.
Tu veux toujours le faire ...
non?
Diana Skouris, votre adoption de Maia Rutledge
est par la présente complète, légale et irrévocable.
Ainsi attesté par moi, Henry Biederman,
de la dixième court des affaires familiales de Seattle.
Vous savez, certains d'entre nous doivent regarder loin
pour trouver ces gens qu'on appelle famille.
Vous deux avez dû regarder à travers le temps.
Diana, permettez-moi de vous
présenter à votre fille, Maia.
Maia, dis bonjour à maman.
Oh, mon dieu, Maia...
Oh, mon dieu...
- Mon dieu...
- Diana, que s'est-il passé ?
Elle a été kidnappée, Tom.
Elle a été emmenée par une
femme qui prétend être sa soeur.
Elle a pris Maia, Tyler Downing, Lindsey Hammond
et un tas de gamins 4400.
Tu te souviens de ça ?
Non, non.
Alors cette femme a pris ces enfants, et d'une manière ou
d'une autre a fait que tout le monde oublie leur existence ?
Oui, mais ils ont existé. Maia Rutledge a disparu de
Crescent City, en Californie, le 3 mars 1946.
Attends, tu dis qu'elle a été enlevée, puis qu'elle est revenue
avec les autres 4400, puis enlevée de nouveau,
et aucun d'entre nous ne s'en souvient, sauf toi ?
- C'est comme s'ils avaient effacé nos mémoires.
- Mais pourquoi ?
Parce qu'ils ne veulent pas qu'on les recherchent.
Les 4400 ont été enlevés et ramenés
pour changer le futur en quelque sorte,
et peut-être que Maia et les autres ont été enlevés pour encore
modifier le futur, mais je ne sais pas, et je m'en fiche.
Tout ce que je sais est qu'il y a 4 jours,
elle était là avec moi,
et j'ai besoin que vous croyiez que j'ai bien
une fille qui s'appelle Maia
et qu'elle m'a été enlevée.
Je ne me souviens pas de Maia,
ni du kidnapping, ni de quoi que ce soit,
et l'idée que ma mémoire ait été manipulée
m'effraie terriblement.
mais après tout ce qu'on a pu traverser
avec les 4400,
oui, Diana ...
je te crois
- Bonjour.
- Richard tyler ?
Oui. Qui est-ce ?
Mon nom est Daniel Armand.
Vous savez qui je suis ?
Du groupe Nova ?
Je pense qu'il est temps pour vous et moi de nous
rencontrer, Richard. Nous avons beaucoup à nous dire.
J'ai beaucoup de choses à vous dire, moi aussi,
mais je ne crois pas que vous voudriez les entendre.
Voilà, vous voyez, c'est le problème.
Nous devrions être alliés, pas adversaires.
Mon groupe et votre organisation ont le même but.
Nous militons pour les droits des 4400..
Sauf que vous militez à travers
le meurtre et l'intimidation.
Il nous manque la supériorité numérique, Richard,
alors nous utilisons les outils à notre disposition.
C'est pour cela que vous m'appelez ?
Pour débattre ?
J'appelle pour convenir d'une trêve,
et pour parler de Shawn Farrell.
Vous allez le menacer davantage ?
Non, nous devons parler de son avenir, Richard.
Parce qu'à moins que vous et moi
n'arrivions à un quelconque accord,
je ne suis pas sûr qu'il en aura un à proposer.
Il dit que je dois le retrouver au
croisement de Pike et Gorch jeudi à 4 heures.
Et ensuite ?
Une voiture sera là pour m'emmener
quelque part pour un face-à-face avec Armand.
J'ai l'impression que le groupe Nova
a lu trop de John Lecarre.
- Qu'est-ce que tu as dit ?
- Je lui ai dit que j'allais y réfléchir.
Réfléchir à quoi ?
Tu n'iras pas.
Ho, ne tirons pas trop vite de conclusions.
J'ai traité avec ce gars avant,
tu t'en souviens ?
Il ne veut qu'une chose.
Tu sais ce que c'est.
L'argent, et probablement les noms et adresses
de tous les 4400 contenus dans nos ordinateurs.
S'ils ont une capacité qu'il puisse utiliser,
il s'en servira, et des gens mourront.
Des gens sont déjà morts.
Peut-être que je peux arrêter ça.
Quoi, tu vas lui faire ouvrir les yeux ?
Non, mais peut-être que
je peux l'empêcher de te tuer.
Comment ? Comment ?
En mettant en danger cet endroit et
tout ce pour quoi on a travaillé ?
Je ne te laisserai pas faire ça.
Belles paroles, Shawn, mais puis-je te rappeler
que si le groupe Nova veut t'atteindre,
je ne pense pas qu'il y ait
un moyen de les en empêcher.
Merci pour tes encouragements, Matthew.
Sois réaliste.
Je le suis. Si je ne me montre pas, c'est comme une déclaration
de guerre, et nous savons tous qui sera la première victime.
Toi et Jordan Collier avez construit cet endroit.
Vous êtes son coeur et son âme.
Alors écoute-moi, Richard.
J'ai essayé de traiter avec ces gens déjà.
ça a été un désastre.
Je te mets en garde...
Je te le demande...
Ne fais pas la même erreur.
S'il te plaît.
Skouris, j'ai ici une liste de tous les 4400
qui sont revenus cette nuit-là à Highland Beach.
Il n'y a ni Maia Rutledge,ni
Tyler Downing, ni Lindsey Hammond.
J'ai expliqué ça déjà.
Ils ont été effacés.
Des archives,
de nos mémoires.
Quelqu'un a essayé d'effacer
toute trace d'eux.
Nous avons parlé aux familles. Durant les dernières semaines,
toutes ont été hantés par les fantômes d'enfants
qu'ils auraient perdus voilà des années.
Ok, admettons que je crois tout ça,
mais ce n'est pas le cas, mais si ça l'était,
nous ne savons même pas où ils auraient été emmenés.
Dans le futur ?
C'est plutôt en dehors de notre juridiction.
J'ai vu Maia. Je lui ai parlé.
Nous l'avons fait tous les 2..
Ok, écoutez, vous me demander de mettre en oeuvre
des hommes et des ressources pour une petite fille
qui n'existe que dans un délire que vous partagez.
Je suis désolée, mais je ne peux pas.
Euh ... vous avez fini ?
Parce que je pense avoir trouvé vos gamins.
Nous y voilà.
Regardez ça.
C'est lui.
C'est Tyler.
Ca date du 19 septembre 1893.
Ils l'ont renvoyé plus loin dans
le passé ? Pourquoi ?
Ben, ça, je ne peux pas vous le dire.
Mais Tyler Downing a terminé premier
de sa promo d'ingénieur à Yale.
Je savais que j'avais
entendu ce nom avant.
En 1915, il a aidé au développement
de la synthèse de pétrole.
Vous êtes venus en voiture au travail ce matin
à cause de ce gars.
Lindsey hammond.
11 juin 1918.
Ca vient de la propriété de Robbert Goddard.
Vous connaissez, "l'homme fusée" ?
Il a adopté une fille nommée Lindsey Hammond.
Elle a vécu avec sa famille et
a finalement travaillé dans son labo,
et elle a inventé tous les matériaux composites
utilisés dans les premières expéditions lunaires.
Ok, alors, des informations sur Maia ?
As-tu trouvé des photos d'elle ?
Euh, non, elle...elle a été un peu plus
difficile à retrouver,
mais, euh,
j'ai finalement trouvé quelque chose.
C'est l'écriture de Maia.
C'est un journal,
de Maia Rutledge.
Daté du 19 avril au 2 septembre 1847.
Ca a été écrit alors qu'elle était à bord d'un
wagon faisant route le long de la voie de l'Oregon.
Je suis désolée. Elle a traversé toutes
les Rocheuses dans un wagon couvert ?
Euh...non.
Elle est morte de la variole en octobre 1847.
Elle avait 25 ans.
Non, désolée, Shawn,
mais ce n'est pas la décision de mon père,
c'est la mienne, et je ne rompts pas avec toi.
Ca n'a rien à voir avec
ton père. Pas du tout.
Toi et moi avons fait des choix.
nous avons fait des choses.
Nous avons fait ce que nous voulions faire
et il n'y a aucune raison pour ne pas continuer.
Nous ferons plus attention.
Mon père ne saura pas.
Ca ne marchera pas.
Plus maintenant.
Lui mentir, faire des choses dans son dos,
nous avons assez donné.
La vérité, Isabelle, est que j'ai
en quelque sorte profité de toi,
et je suis vraiment désolé.
Tu es si mignon de t'inquiéter
comme ça à mon sujet.
Je ne veux pas que cette relation s'arrête.
Alors ça ne s'arrêtera pas.
Il faut que je la vois.
Je t'en prie, peux-tu m'emmener
voir ma fille ?
Diana, tu sais que ce n'est pas
vraiment Maia que tu as vue ?
Oh, je m'en fiche.
J'ai découvert que ma fille, que j'ai aimée,
a été renvoyée dans le passé, et est morte
il y a 150 ans, et je suis désolée,
mais ça va me prendre un moment pour
que je m'y fasse, mais je ...
S'il te plaît, laisse-moi faire ça.
J'ai besoin de lui dire adieu.
Donne-moi ton manteau.
Je vais faire du café.
Prête ?
Maman...
maman, je meurs de faim.
Je peux avoir des pancakes ?
Je t'aiderai à les faire.
Ok.
J'ai besoin des oeufs au frigo...
Et donne-moi le grand bol en plastique.
Oh, mon dieu.
Alana ! Alana !
Alana, chérie...
mon dieu, tu saignes. Tu vas bien ?
Je...je crois que oui.
Diana...diana, tu m'entends ?
Diana, regarde-moi.
Bon sang que se passe-t-il ?
Je pensais nous avoir ramenées.
Pourquoi n'est-elle pas réveillée ?
Je n'avais pas d'emprise sur elle.
C'est comme si elle décrochait.
Thomas...je crois qu'elle est encore
dans le monde imaginaire.
Comment peut-elle y être sans toi ?
Je ne suis pas certaine.
Quand toi et moi nous nous séparons,
l'illusion s'en va.
- Mais elle ne l'a pas laissée filer.
- Quoi, elle n'en sort pas ?
Je pense qu'elle y est heureuse
avec sa fille.
et elle n'a aucune intention
de l'abandonner.
Oh, reviens
Tout d'abord je pensais qu'elle avait subi
une sorte d'hémorragie intracérébrale.
mais l'IRM ne montre aucun saignement
dans le cerveau.
Alors elle n'a subi aucune lésion ?
Pas pour le moment, mais l'encéphalograme
était très troublant.
L'activité de son cerveau est bien au-dessus
de la normale et continue d'augmenter.
C'est pareil pour son rythme cardiaque,
sa respiration, sa pression sanguine.
Ils sont tous dans le rouge, si vous voulez.
Une idée de ce qui a provoqué ça ?
Je ne peux pas le certifier pour l'sintant, mais son
métabolisme ne pourra pas rester comme ça très longtemps.
A un moment, ses organes flancheront.
Quoi, elle peut mourir ?
A moins de pouvoir ralentir ses taux,
nous allons vers cette issue fatale.
A-t-elle de la famille ?
Oui.
Vous devriez les appeler.
Je dois lui parler.
Tu peux faire ça ? M'emmener voir Diana ?
- Pousse-moi un peu, maman.
- Hé, je te pousse déjà.
Alors plus haut.
Pas aussi haut !
Mais c'est plus drôle.
Elle marque un point.
Je pensais vous voir toutes les 2.
Je ne t'ai pas blessée, hein ?
Ca semblait un peu déroutant quand tu es partie.
- Je vais bien.
- Pas toi, par contre.
C'est là que tu te trompes,
car je vais bien.
Tu es aux soins intensifs, Diana.
Je pense que ça peut s'arrêter là.
A combien est mon rythme cardiaque ?
170 ? 175 ?
- Plus haut.
- Ca me donne quoi, peut-être
entre trois semaines et deux mois.
- Ca peut correspondre à toujours ici.
- C'est du suicide.
J'apprécie que tu te préoccupes, Tom,
j'apprécie,
mais j'aimerais vraiment que vous
partiez, tous les deux.
Ecoute, Diana, crois-moi ...
ne pars pas !
La première fois que je suis venu dans ce genre
d'endroit, je n'ai jamais voulu en partir.
Mais j'ai réalisé que ce n'est pas
le monde réel.
Rien de tout ça n'est réel,
ainsi que... Maia.
Maman, pousse-moi un peu plus fort.
Elle est assez réelle pour moi.
Oh, elle ne reviendra pas, c'est ça ?
Elle va mourir là-bas.
Il semblerait que ce soit ce qu'elle veut.
Je ne peux pas t'aider mais je pense que c'est
de ma faute. Je ne peux prendre cela que sur moi.
Non, ne te repproche rien.
Tu n'as pas enlevé Maia .
Les gens qui ont fait ça, ce sont eux les coupables.
Peut-être...
Mais ces gens,
le futur,
Il ne semble pas se préoccuper des
blessés, non ?
Non, en effet.
Il est bientôt 16h00.
Tu as pris ta décision ?
Si je veux faire amis-amis avec un terroriste ou
entrer en guerre avec lui ?
Cela semble être la bonne question. Quoique
tu décides, tu peux compter sur mon soutien.
Isabelle ?
Isabelle...
Ma relation avec Shawn ne te regarde pas.
C'est faux. Je me préoccupe juste de
ce qui peut t'arriver.
Tu peux t'occuper de moi tant que tu veux.
Reste juste en dehors de mes affaires.
- Il n'en est pas question.
- Si...
Isabelle...
Papa...
Papa...
Je suis désolé.
Ok...
Tout va bien, bébé.
Je ne sais pas si tu peux m'entendre,
mais j'ai réfléchi.
Tu vois, depuis que les 4400 sont revenues,
ça a été sacrifice après sacrifice.
Toi, ta fille, mon fils....
Ca doit cesser.
Donc j'ai un plan.
Je ne suis pas sûr si ça va marcher.
C'est peut-être la chose la plus stupide
que je prévois de faire.
J'aurais aimé que tu sois là pour m'en empêcher,
Mais tu n'es pas là, et je dois essayer quelque chose.
Peut-être que c'est un au revoir,
peut-être que non.
La travail n'aurait jamais été pareil sans toi.
Ok, ok.
Ok, ça va marcher, hein ?
Ca a fonctionné, hein ?
Je..Je ne suis pas mort.
Pas cette fois, non. Mais la prochaine fois
tu n'auras pas autant de chance.
Les enfants que vous avez pris,
Maia et les autres, je veux qu'ils reviennent.
Vous n'étiez pas sensés vous rappeler d'eux.
Nous avons passé beaucoup de temps à les effacer
de votre mémoire, à vous épargner la souffrance.
Ca n'a pas fonctionné.
On dirait que nous avons sous-estimé les liens
qu'ils ont crée.
Ca s'appelle la famille.
Vous savez ce que ça veut dire ?
Vous n'aviez pas le droit de les prendre,
de traiter des personnes de cette manière.
Maia avait seulement 25 ans quand elle est décédée.
Maintenant, soit vous faites revenir les enfants, ou soit vous
me remettez cette corde autour du cou, pour que j'en finisse.
Dans ce cas, je dois vous montrez quelque chose.
Ils sont en vie.
Vous nous avez contraint de les faire revenir...
De les arracher du cours du temps,
mais les faire revenir serait une erreur,
Pour notre époque et pour la vôtre.
Les 4400 était une expérience
prédestinée à l'échec.
Il y avait tellement d'options différentes.
C'était impossible de toutes les prédire.
Donc vous êtes en train de me dire
que tout ce que vous avez fait,
Prendre les 4400, les renvoyés,
Ca n'a rien changé ?
La catastrophe est toujours imminente ?
Nos ennemis sont plus ingénieux
que nous l'avions imaginés.
Ennemis ?
Il y a ceux qui parmi nous
préférent que l'histoire reste inchangée,
alors ce qui veut dire que les 4400
échoueront dans leur mission.
Vous dites, ils veulent que
les humains disparaissent ?
Ils sont convaincus qu'ils survivront.
Pas seulement survivre,
mais profitez du chaos.
Si vous pensez que nous sommes cruels, je vous assure
que l'autre côté l'est dix fois pire.
Et ils vont libérés une chose terrible
dans votre époque.
Renvoyés ces enfants un peu plus loin dans le temps
était une tentative de combatre cette chose.
Si nous les faisons revenir, tous ce qu'ils auront
accomplis n'aura servi a rien.
Les 4400, et tout ce qu'ils avaient l'intention
de faire, seront en péril.
Cette chose, il doit y avoir
un autre moyen de la combattre.
En effet.
Vous.
vous êtes l'autre moyen.
c'est un fardeau que nous ne
voulions pas vous faire porter.
Si vous faites revenir Maia et les autres,
je ferai tout ce que vous voulez.
Ce qu'on veut, vous ne serez peut-être
pas disposé à nous le donner.
On a un marché ou pas ?
Ok, mais c'est un marché, j'ai bien
peur que vous ayez à le regretter.
Y'a quelqu'un !
Y'a quelqu'un !
Y'a quelqu'un ici ?
Tom Baldwin.
Maia ?
- Tom !
- Maia...
Maia...
C'est bon.
Il travaille avec ma mère.
- Nous avons été kidnappés.
- Où est Sara ?
- On peut rentrer chez nous ?
- Vous l'avez attrapés ?
Oui, Oui, Oui.
Oui. Shh... Vous allez tous rentrer chez vous.
C'est fini.
Vous êtes en sécurité à présent.
- Est-ce que ma maman est là ?
- Elle n'est pas là,
Mais je vais t'amener auprès d'elle, ok ?
Allô ?
Il n'est encore arrivé ?
Alors il a fait son choix.
Où tu te caches ?
Allez...
Je sais que tu me surveilles.
Je sais que tu m'entends.
Je t'ai trouvé.
Je t'ai trouvé mouchard.
J'ai trouvé ton stupide petit mouchard.
Ok, chérie, extinction des feux.
Elle est encore tôt.
Il est 21h30, et il est temps
d'aller au lit.
Ok, mais avant je veux que
tu fasses quelque chose pour moi.
Maia, n'essaye pas de m'avoir.
Maman, pitié. Ca ne durera pas longtemps.
Tout ce que tu as à faire est de fermer les yeux.
Très bien. Ok, bien, ils sont fermés.
Et après ?
Maia ?
Je suis là maman.
Tu peux ouvrir les yeux à présent.
Maman ?
Reveille-toi.
c'est bon.
Je suis revenue.
Tout va bien ...
Mais tu dois te réveiller.
Maman, je t'en supplie, reveille-toi.
Allez...
Maia ?
Maia ?
Tuez Isabelle !

OVER THE LAST 60 YEARS 4400 PEOPLE

I'M MAIA'S SISTER.
DO YOU SEE THE FUTUREMORE CLEARLY
SINCE YOU STOPPED TAKING THE INHIBITOR ?
WHO ARE YOU ?
I'M LINDSEY.
I'M A PART OF HER COLLECTION.
WE ALL ARE.
[SCREAMING]: TYLER! DUNCAN!
[SARA]: YOU'VE BEEN HERE
EVER SINCE YOU WALKED THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR OF MY HOUSE.
YOU'RE IN THE FUTURE.
WE HAD TO BRING YOUHERE,MAIA,
YOU ANDYOUR FRIENDS.
BEFORE WE PUT YOU BACK IN YOUR NEW TIME,
WE'LL MAKE YOU FORGET YOUR MOTHER.
PLEASE, DON'T.
[SARA]:THEY'LL FORGET YOU, TOO.
HEY.
OH, MARCO, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
HOW DID YOU KNOW I LIKE ANEMONES ?
YOU REMEMBER THAT BADITALIAN RESTAURANT ?
I ASKED YOU WHAT YOUR FAVORITE FLOWER WAS,
AND YOU SAID...
ANEMONES.
MOST GUYS DON'T EVEN LISTEN TO TABLE TALK.
YOU NOT ONLY HEARD ME, YOU REMEMBERED.
DO YOU KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU'RE GOING TO GET TONIGHT ?
AH, THEN MY PLAN IS WORKING.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE
THE TWO OF US.
IT IS.
THEN WHO'S THE OTHER PLATE FOR ?
DI ?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.
[***]music
YOU HAVING FUN ?
OF COURSE I'M HAVING FUN.
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANTA TURN AT THE WHEEL ?
IT'S YOUR FANTASY.
OKAY, HONEY. HOLD ON.
LOOK OUT!
[BRAKES SCREECHING]
[GASPS]
YOU ALL RIGHT ?
I THINK SO.
YOU SAW HER, TOO,RIGHT ? OF COURSE I DID.
WHY WOULD A LITTLE GIRL BE STANDING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
A JOY RIDEIN THE COUNTRY,
THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED ON, RIGHT ?
A GREAT CAR, A DESERTED ROAD.
HITTING SOME KID AT 80 MILES PLUS...
WHERE THE HELL DOES THAT COME IN ?
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER ?
THOMAS...
HEY !
HEY ! HEY...
HEY...
ARE YOU OKAY ?
WHO WAS SHE ?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
[***]music
* SO LONG AGO,ANOTHER LIFE *
* I CAN FEEL YOUR HEART BEAT *
* IT'S NOT A DREAM REMEMBER US *
* I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES *
* WE'LL FIND OUR PLACE IN TIME *
* OUR PLACE IN TIME BEYOND THE SUN *
* WE'LL FIND OUR PLACE IN TIME *
* OUR PLACE IN TIMETO CALL OUR OWN *
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE GONE AWAY TOGETHER
IN ONE OF THESE FANTASY WORLDS YOU CREATE ?
A DOZEN TIMES,TWO DOZEN ?
AT LEAST.
AND THESE WORLDS,
THEY ALWAYS FEEL REAL.
EXCEPT THIS TIME,
A GIRL WITHOUT A FACE APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE.
IT FELT MORE LIKE A NIGHTMARE.
BUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN
SOONER OR LATER.
I BUILD THESE WORLDS OUT OF OUR MEMORIES,
I GUESS THIS TIME I DREDGED UP SOMETHING INCOMPLETE.
A FRAGMENT OF SOMETHING,
A SORT OF MENTAL HICCUP.
OKAY, BUT THIS GIRL,
IS SHE PART OF MY MEMORYOR YOURS ?
YOURS, MINE, BOTH...
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW,IS THERE ?
ONE OF US MIGHT HAVE SEEN HER PICTURE IN A BOOK.
OR SEEN HER IN THE STREET.
WE JUST DON'T REMEMBER HER FACE.
IT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN A GLIMPSE.
A GLIMPSE PRETTY MUCHRUINED OUR NIGHT.
WELL, TOMORROW NIGHT WILL BE BETTER, I PROMISE.
ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO,
ANYWHERE WE WANT TO GO,
AND ANYTHING WE WANT TO DO.
[CHUCKLES]
YOU KNOW, FOR HIS 12th BIRTHDAY,
I TOOK KYLE FISHINGUP AT THE DOSEWALLIPS RIVER.
I THOUGHT MAYBE THE THREE OF US COULD GO THERE.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
AND MAYBE THIS TIME,
WE COULD ACTUALLYCATCH SOME FISH.
OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BEDROOM...
OR YOURS FOR THAT MATTER.
[ISABELLE MOANS]
WE'VE ALREADYDONE IT THERE
A BUNCH OF TIMES.
EXPERTS SAY YOU SHOULD DO ADVENTUROUS THINGS
TO KEEP RELATIONSHIPS MORE INTERESTING.
THEY SAY THAT, HUH ?
MM-HMM.
WHAT COULD BE MORE ADVENTUROUS
THAN A QUICKIEON THE STAIRCASE ?
DID YOU SWITCH FROMENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA
TO <i>COSMO MAGAZINE</i>OR SOMETHING ?
WELL, I READ LOTS OF STUFF.
UH...
I'LL TAKE THE ELEVATOR.
DEVON...
HOW EMBARRASSING FOR HER.
ISABELLE, JUST STOP.
JUST...
[SIGHS]
WHAT'S THE MATTER,SHAWN ?
WHAT'S WRONG ?
SHE'S NOT GOING TO TELL MY FATHER.
SHE'D BE TOO AFRAID OF ME.
ISABELLE, SHE'S GOING TO TELL SOMEONE,
AND THEY'LL TELL SOMEONE ELSE,
AND THEN EVERYBODY'S GOING TO KNOW.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]
WHERE'S YOUR PARTNER ?
LATE.
A 4400, CHRISTOPHER DUBOV WAS BEEN ATTACK
ASIDE THIS HOME LAST NIGHT.
I WANT TO KNOW IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A HATE CRIME.
IT SAYS HERE HE'S A LAWYER AT TELLER AND DUTCH.
THAT'S A MAJOR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS FIRM.
THEY'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE FINANCIAL PAGES THIS YEAR.
YEAH, WHICH MAKES HIM A HIGH-PROFILE 4400.
AN EASY TARGET
FOR SOMEBODY LOOKINGTO MAKE A POINT.
HIS 4400 STATUS
ISN'T THE ONLY MOTIVE SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE
TO ATTACK HIM.
JUST TALK TO HIM.
SEE IF HE CANWRITE YOU UP A LIST.
OH...
ALARM CLOCK NEED NEW BATTERIES ?
NO, IT'S A CRAPPY MORNING.
YOU OPENING UP A NEWSSTAND ?
NO, JUST A...
PROJECTI'M WORKING ON.
SO, WHAT DO WE GOT ?
YEAH, YOU COULD CALL ITA HATE CRIME.
MY SON MICHAEL CERTAINLY HATES ME.
YOUR SON DID THIS TO YOU, MR. DUBOV ?
HIS MOM AND I SPLIT UP.
HE BLAMES ME.
I'M THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED HER TO BOB,
HER NEW HUSBAND.
I KNEW THEY BELONGED TOGETHER.
I COULD SMELL IT.
I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW.
IT'S MY ABILITY.
IT SHOWED UP ONCE I STOPPED TAKING THE PROMICIN INHIBITOR.
I CAN SMELL PHEROMONES.
YOU MEAN THE STUFF PEOPLE PUT OUT
TO ATTRACT OTHER PEOPLE ?
WEIRD, HUH ?
THINGS BETWEEN MY WIFE AND I
HAVEN'T BEEN TOO GOODFOR A WHILE.
THEN I MET BOB.
HE'S MY NEW DENTIST.
RIGHT AWAY,
THERE WAS SOMETHING FAMILIAR ABOUT HIM.
THEN I REALIZED WHAT IT WAS.
HE SMELLED JUST LIKE CAROLINE.
SO I MADE HER AN APPOINTMENT.
I HAD TO KNOW
WHETHER OR NOT THEY BELONGED TOGETHER.
LET ME GUESS--LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
SIGHT, SMELL, WHATEVER.
YOU AND YOUR SONLOOK VERY HAPPY TOGETHER.
THOSE WERE TAKEN WHEN MICHAEL WAS 10.
10...
THAT'S A...
THAT'S A GREAT AGE.
MR. DUBOV...
DO YOU WANT US TO TALK TO MICHAEL ?
ASSAULT IS A SERIOUS CRIME ?
FORGET IT.
I'M SORRY MY SECRETARY CALLED YOU.
BESIDES,I THINK I KNOW A WAYTO GET HIM TO FORGIVE ME.
THERE'S A NEW BAR AROUND THE CORNER.
ONE OF THE WAITRESSES,
SHE SMELLS JUST LIKE MY KID.
LET'S HOPE SHE'S NOT MARRIED.
AMEN TO THAT.
YOU KNOW, I BET IF THAT GUY QUIT HIS JOB
AND OPENED UPA DATING SERVICE,
HE'D MAKE A FORTUNE.
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE
HOW TURNING A CORPORATE LAWYER
INTO CUPID
IS GOING TO HELP SAVE THE FUTURE.
HEY...
HONEY, WHAT'S GOING ON ?
[SOBS]
YOU ALL RIGHT ?
DUBOV WAS GONEFOR, LIKE, FIVE YEARS, RIGHT ?
I...
I BET HIS SON REALLY MISSED HIM.
PROBABLY.
I MEAN, EVERY 4400 LEFT SOMEONE BEHIND.
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S NOT SOMETHING ELSE ?
NO...
IT'S FINE, REALLY.
IT'LL PASS.
OKAY...
PHYSICAL...
YOU AND ISABELLE.
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT ?
I ASKED YOUA QUESTION !
WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND MY DAUGHTER ?
WE NEVER PLANNED ON GOING BEHIND YOUR BACK.
IN FACT, WE NEVER PLANNED IT AT ALL.
IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED.
FRIENDSHIP ! REMEMBER, WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S AS FAR AS IT WASSUPPOSED TO GO.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY, TOO.
I'M SORRY I EVER TRUSTED YOU.
ISABELLE IS JUST A CHILD--
NO, RICHARD, SHE ISN'T.
SHE'S EMOTIONALLY IMMATURE, AND YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT !
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK ?
YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT. THAT'S NOT FAIR.
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT PROMISE TO YOU.
I AM NOT GIVING YOU A CHOICE HERE,
YOU UNDERSTAND ME ?
THIS THING BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,
IT IS OVER.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
I DON'T RECALL SAYING "COME IN."
I THOUGHT PERHAPS
A REFEREE MIGHT BE IN ORDER.
MAY I ADVISE YOU GENTLEMEN
TO GO TO YOURNEUTRAL CORNERS ?
THIS IS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION, MATTHEW.
IT MAY HAVE STARTED OUT THAT WAY,
BUT I ASSURE YOU,IT'S BECOMING VERY PUBLIC.
I COULD HEAR YOU OUT IN THE HALLWAY,
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH RICHARD.
THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ISABELLE IS ILL-ADVISED AT BEST.
I THOUGHT REFEREES DIDN'T TAKE SIDES.
IF I WERE YOU, SHAWN,
I'D TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITYTO MAKE A GRACEFUL EXIT.
THINK ABOUTWHAT I SAID, SHAWN.
I'M EXPECTING YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
WHAT'S FOR LUNCH ?
[LAUGHS]
PROSCIUTTO WITH FIGS.
ROSEMARY CHICKEN,
COUSCOUS, AND RASPBERRIES.
WOW.
YOU KNOW, WHEN KYLE AND I USED TO GO FISHING,
WE'D TAKE A HALF A DOZEN
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICHES
AND THINK WE WERE LIVING LIKE KINGS.
WELL, I LIKE TO THINK THE REALITY I CREATE
IS A LITTLE BIT TASTIER THAN THAT.
[LAUGHS]
GOOD.
HEY, WE OUGHT TO GET GOING.
HEY, KYLE !
COME ON, BUDDY !
LET'S GET MOVING !
COME ON...
IT'S YOU.
THE GIRL IN THE ROAD.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU REMEMBER.
MAIA.
MAIA...
HAVE WE MET BEFORE ?
DON'T BE SILLY.
NO, NO, I'M SORRY.
I-I DON'T REMEMBER YOU.
SURE YOU DO.
THINK HARDER.
IS THAT WHY YOU KEEP SHOWING UP ?
BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO REMEMBER ?
I'M HERE BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT ME HERE.
THERE HAS TO BEA REASON
WHY THIS GIRLKEEPS SHOWING UP.
THERE WAS NOTHING FAMILIAR ABOUT HER ?
NOTHING AT ALL ?
NO...
BUT SHE KEPT ACTING LIKE WE KNEW EACH OTHER,
IF I DID BRING HER THERE,
THEN I MUST KNOW HER FROM SOMEWHERE.
[SIGHS]
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
TOM...
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT WORK ?
JARVIS SAID YOU CALLED IN SICK.
WELL, I'M ALLOWED.
THANKS FOR CHECKING IN ON ME.
COME ON,DIANA.
TALK TO ME. WHAT ARE YOU...
WHAT THE HELL'SALL THIS ?
IT'S JUST A PROJECT I'M WORKING ON.
I MENTIONED IT TO YOU.
WHO'S THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ?
I WISH I KNEW.
I KNOW THIS MIGHT SOUND CREEPY,
BUT I WAS UP ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT
CUTTING OUT PICTURESOF LITTLE GIRLS,
AND NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO BE THE RIGHT ONE.
I MEAN,I THINK I'M GOING CRAZY.
THEN WE BOTH ARE.
YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE DREAM VACATIONS I TAKE
WITH ALANA ?
THIS LITTLE GIRLKEEPS SHOWING UP IN THEM.
THIS LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, SAYS HER...
HER NAME IS MAIA.
MAIA...
OH, TOM...
WHAT ?
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH ME.
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
WHO IS SHE, TOM ?
WHO IS MAIA ?
I DONT KNOW.
THERE'S NO MENTION OF SOMEONE NAMED MAIA
IN ANY OF OUR CASE FILES.
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE WE MET HER TOGETHER
SOMEPLACE ELSE.
MAYBE AT ONE OF GARRITY'S BARBECUES.
NO, THAT DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT.
I DIDN'T JUST MEET THIS GIRL ONCE
AT A BARBECUE.
I KNOW HER BETTER THAN THAT.
ALL RIGHT, JUST CALM DOWN.
WELL,  THERE'SA REASON
THIS GIRL ISHAUNTING US, TOM.
OKAY, SHE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,
AND SHE WANTS US TO FIND HER.
WELL, RIGHT NOW THE ONLY PLACE I KNOW SHE EXISTS
IS IN ONE OF THESE DREAMWORLDS THAT ALANA AND I CREATE.
WELL, THEN I NEED
FOR ALANATO TAKE ME THERE.
I NEED TO MEET THIS GIRL,
TALK TO HER.
NO, BUT YOU WOULDN'T REALLY
BE TALKING TO HER, DIANA.
YOU'D JUST BE TALKING TO WHATEVER
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS REMEMBERS OF HER.
WELL, MAYBE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME TO FIGURE OUT WHO SHE IS.
HOW DO I SOUND ?
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR YEARS.
BUT I HAVEN'T. IT'S MY FIRST TIME.
I KIND OF FIGURED THAT.
ISABELLE, YOU HAVE A MINUTE ?
HAVE A SEAT.
[SIGHS]
UH...
ISABELLE, YOU KNOWI'M PROUD OF YOU, DON'T YOU ?
THIS IS ABOUT SHAWN AND IHAVING SEX, ISN'T IT ?
THAT-- THAT'S PART OF IT, YEAH, YEAH,
BUT ONLY PART OF IT.
RIGHT NOW, EVERYTHING IS NEW TO YOU.
YOU'RE LEARNING SO MUCH, SO FAST.
HOW TO BE A...
A DAUGHTER...
A FRIEND--
A LOVER.
THAT PART YOU MIGHT BE LEARNING A LITTLE TOO FAST--
I WOULD JUST LIKE IT IF YOU AND SHAWN SLOWED DOWN--
STOPPED SLEEPING TOGETHER ?
FOR THE TIME BEING.
THERE'S NO REASON TO STOP.
SHAWN CARES ABOUT ME. I CARE ABOUT SHAWN.
THE SEX IS WONDERFUL.
IT MAKES US BOTH VERY HAPPY.
IT SHOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY, TOO.
MAYBE IT SHOULD,BUT IT DOESN'T.
I SUPPOSE THAT'S NORMAL.
BUT EVERYTHING'SGOING TO BE OKAY.
SHAWN WOULD NEVERDO ANYTHING TO HURT ME.
HE'S WAY TOO SMART FOR THAT.
SO YOU SEE ?
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
I WONDER IF ANYONE AT THE CENTER
HAS A CELLO.
SO, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO ?
WELL, THE MAIN THINGIS TO RELAX.
OH, MY GOD.
I USUALLY CLOSE MY EYES
AND COUNT BACKWARDSFROM 10.
BEFORE I REACH ZERO, WE'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE YOU WANT ALANATO TAKE YOU ?
WE USUALLY HAVE A DESTINATION
PICKED OUT.
WELL, WHEREVER MAIA IS.
I MEAN, YOU CAN DO THAT, CAN'T YOU ?
YOU CANTAKE ME TO HER.
SHE SEEMS TO SHOW UP ANY PLACE WE GO.
SO IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE.
HOW ABOUT MY APARTMENT ?
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, LET'S BEGIN.
ALANA...
THIS IS NOT MY APARTMENT.
I KNOW.
I'M NOT QUITE SUREWHAT JUST HAPPENED.
YOU DONE TALKING TO YOUR FRIEND ?
YOU'RE MAIA.
STOP FOOLING AROUND.
COME ON. HE'S WAITING FOR US.
THERE YOU ARE, MS. SKOURIS.
THE DOCUMENTS ARE ALL READY.
IF YOU'LL JUST HAVE A SEATAND SIGN WHERE INDICATED,
WE CAN FINISH UP.
YOU STILL WANT TO DO THIS...
DON'T YOU ?
DIANA SKOURIS, YOUR ADOPTION OF MAIA RUTLEDGE
IS HEREBY COMPLETE, LEGAL, AND BINDING.
SO WITNESSED BY ME, HENRY BIEDERMAN,
OF THE TENTH CIRCUIT FAMILY COURT OF SEATTLE.
YOU KNOW, SOME OF USHAVE TO LOOK FAR AND WIDE
TO FIND THE PEOPLE WE'LL CALL FAMILY.
YOU TWO HAD TO LOOK CLEAR ACROSS TIME.
DIANA, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO YOUR DAUGHTER MAIA.
MAIA, SAY HELLO TO MOMMY.
OH, MY GOD, MAIA...
OH, MY GOD...
MY GOD...
DIANA, WHAT HAPPENED ?
SHE WAS KIDNAPPED,TOM.
SHE WAS TAKEN
BY A WOMAN PRETENDINGTO BE HER SISTER.
SHE TOOK MAIA, TYLER DOWNING, LINDSEY HAMMOND,
AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF 4400 KIDS.
DO YOU REMEMBERANY OF THIS ?
NO. NO, I DON'T.
SO THIS WOMAN TOOK THESE CHILDREN,
AND SOMEHOW MADE EVERYONE FORGET
THEY EVER EXISTED ?
YES, BUT THEY EXISTED.
MAIA RUTLEDGE DISAPPEARED FROM CRESCENT CITY, CALIFORNIA
MARCH 3rd,1946.
WAIT, YOU'RE SAYING SHE WAS ABDUCTED,
THEN RETURNED WITH THE OTHER 4400,
THEN TAKEN AGAIN,
AND NONE OF US REMEMBER THIS BUT YOU ?
IT'S LIKE THEY'VE WIPED ALL OUR MEMORIES.
BUT WHY ?
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT US LOOKING FOR THEM.
THE 4400 WERE TAKEN AND RETURNED
TO CHANGE THE FUTURE IN SOME WAY,
AND MAYBE MAIA AND THE OTHERS WERE TAKEN
SO THAT THEY COULD CHANGE IT AGAIN,
BUT I DON'T KNOW,AND I DON'T CARE.
ALL I KNOW IS THAT FOUR DAYS AGO,
SHE WAS HERE WITH ME,
AND I NEED YOU TO BELIEVE
THAT I HAVE A DAUGHTER NAMED MAIA,
AND THAT SHE'S BEEN TAKEN FROM ME.
I DON'T REMEMBER MAIA,
OR THE KIDNAPPING, OR ANY OF IT,
AND THE IDEA
THAT MY MEMORY'S BEEN MESSED WITH
SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME,
BUT AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
WITH THE 4400,
YES, DIANA...
I BELIEVE YOU.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
HELLO.
<i>RICHARD TYLER ?</i>
YES. WHO IS THIS ?
<i>MY NAME IS</i> <i>DANIEL ARMAND.</i>
<i>YOU KNOW WHO I AM ?</i>
OF THE NOVA GROUP ?
I THINK IT'S TIME YOU AND I MET, RICHARD.
<i>WE HAVE A LOT</i><i>TO DISCUSS.</i>
I HAVE A LOT I'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU,TOO,
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HEAR IT.
NOW, YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM, RIGHT THERE.
<i>WE SHOULD BE ALLIES,</i><i>NOT ADVERSARIES.</i>
<i>MY GROUP</i><i>AND YOUR ORGANIZATION</i>
<i>HAVE THE SAME GOAL.</i>
WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE 4400.
EXCEPT THAT YOU ADVOCATE
THROUGH ASSASSINATION AND INTIMIDATION.
WE LACK THE STRENGTH OF NUMBERS, RICHARD,
SO WE USE THE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL.
IS THAT WHAT YOU CALLED ME FOR ?
TO HAVE A DEBATE ?
<i>I CALLED</i><i>TO ARRANGE A TRUCE,</i>
AND TO TALK ABOUT SHAWN FARRELL.
YOU GOING TO MAKE MORE THREATS AGAINST HIM ?
NO, WE NEED TO DISCUSS HIS FUTURE, RICHARD.
<i>BECAUSE UNLESS</i><i>YOU AND I</i>
<i>CAN COME TO SOME KIND</i><i>OF AN AGREEMENT,</i>
I'M NOT SURE HE'S GOING TO HAVE ONE.
<i>[CLICK]</i>
HE SAYS I SHOULD MEET HIM ON THE CORNER OF PIKE AND GORCH
THURSDAY AT 4:00.
AND THEN ?
A CAR WILL BE THERE TO PICK ME UP
AND TAKE ME SOMEPLACE
FOR A FACE-TO-FACE WITH ARMAND.
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE NOVA GROUP'S
BEEN READING TOO MUCH JOHN LeCARRE.
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?
I TOLD HIMI'D THINK ABOUT IT.
WHAT IS THERE TO THINK ABOUT ?
YOU'RE NOT GOING.
WHOA, LET'S NOT RUSH TO JUDGMENT.
I'VE DEALT WITH THIS GUY BEFORE, REMEMBER ?
HE WANTS ONE THING. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.
MONEY, AND PROBABLY
THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF EVERY 4400 IN OUR COMPUTER.
IF THEY HAVE AN ABILITYTHAT HE CAN USE,
HE WILL EXPLOIT IT,AND PEOPLE WILL DIE.
PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY DIED. MAYBE I CAN STOP IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE HIM SEE THE LIGHT ?
NO, BUT MAYBE I COULD STOP HIM FROM KILLING YOU.
HOW ?
HOW ?
BY PUTTING THIS PLACE
AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE WORKED FOR
IN JEOPARDY ?
I WON'T LET YOU DO THAT.
NOBLE WORDS, SHAWN, BUT MAY I REMIND YOU
IF THE NOVA GROUP WANTS TO STRIKE AT YOU,
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY WAY
WE CAN PREVENT IT.
THANK YOU FOR THE PEP TALK, MATTHEW.
JUST BEING REALISTIC.
SO AM I.
IF I DON'T SHOW,
IT'S LIKE A DECLARATION OF WAR,
AND WE ALL KNOW WHO THE FIRST CASUALTY WILL BE.
YOU AND JORDAN COLLIER BUILT THIS PLACE.
YOU'RE ITS HEART AND SOUL.
THEN LISTEN TO ME, RICHARD.
I TRIED TO DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE BEFORE.
IT WAS A DISASTER.
I'M WARNING YOU...
I'M ASKING YOU...
PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.
PLEASE.
SKOURIS, I HAVE A LIST RIGHT HERE
OF EVERY 4400 WHO RETURNED THAT NIGHT
TO HIGHLAND BEACH.
THERE'S NO MAIA RUTLEDGE,
THERE'S NO TYLER DOWNING,
THERE'S NO LINDSEY HAMMOND.
I'VE EXPLAINED THAT.
THEY'VE BEEN ERASED.
FROM THE RECORDS, FROM OUR MEMORIES.
SOMEONE HAS TRIED TO WIPE OUT
EVERY TRACE OF THEM.
WE TALKED TO THE FAMILIES.
IN THE LAST WEEK, ALL OF THEM
HAVE BEEN HAUNTED BY PHANTOM MEMORIES OF CHILDREN
THEY SUPPOSEDLY LOST YEARS AGO.
OKAY, LET'S SAY FOR A MINUTE
THAT I AM BUYING ANY OF THIS, AND I'M NOT,
BUT IF I DID,
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THEY WERE TAKEN.
THE FUTURE ?
THAT'S KIND OF OUT OF OUR JURISDICTION.
I'VE SEEN MAIA.
I'VE SPOKEN TO HER.
WE BOTH HAVE.
OKAY, LOOK,
YOU ARE ASKING ME TO COMMIT MANPOWER AND RESOURCE
YOU GUYS PLAY AROUND IN.
LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T DO IT.
UH, YOU GUYS THROUGH ?
BECAUSE I THINK I FOUND YOUR KIDS.
[MARCO]: HERE WE GO. WATCH THIS.
THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S TYLER.
IT'S DATED SEPTEMBER 19th,1893.
THEY SENT HIM BACK FURTHER INTO THE PAST ?
WHY ?
WELL, THAT, I CAN'T TELL YOU.
BUT TYLER DOWNING DID GRADUATE
FIRST IN HIS CLASS FROM YALE UNIVERSITY
IN ENGINEERING.
I KNEW I'D HEARD THE NAME BEFORE.
IN 1915,HE HELPED DEVELOP SYNTHETIC PETROLEUM.
YOU DROVE TO WORK THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF THIS GUY.
LINDSEY HAMMOND. JUNE 11th,1918.
THIS IS FROM THE ESTATE OF ROBERT GODDARD.
YOU KNOW, THE ROCKET GUY ?
HE ADOPTED AN ORPHAN NAMED LINDSEY HAMMOND.
EVENTUALLY WORKED IN HIS LAB,
AND SHE INVENTED ALL THE COMPOSITE MATERIALS
USED IN THE FIRST LUNAR COLONIES.
OKAY, SO, WHAT ABOUT MAIA ? DID YOU FIND ANY PHOTOS OF HER ?
UH, NO, SHE...
SHE WAS A LITTLE HARDER TO TRACK DOWN,
BUT, UH, I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING.
THAT'S MAIA'S HANDWRITING.
IT'S A DIARY,FROM MAIA RUTLEDGE.
DATED APRIL 19th THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2nd,1847.
IT WAS WRITTEN WHILE SHE WASPART OF A WAGON TRAIN
MAKING ITS WAY ALONG THE OREGON TRAIL.
I'M SORRY, SHE CROSSED THE ROCKIES
IN A COVERED WAGON ?
UH...NO.
SHE DIED OF SMALLPOX IN OCTOBER OF '47.
SHE WAS 25.
NO, I'M SORRY, SHAWN,
BUT IT'S NOT MY FATHER'S DECISION, IT'S MINE,
AND I'M NOTBREAKING UP WITH YOU.
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR DAD.
NOT REALLY.
YOU AND I MADE SOME DECISIONS. WE DID SOME THINGS.
WE DID WHAT WE WANTED TO DO,
AND THERE'S NO REASONWE CAN'T KEEP DOING THAT.
WE'LL BE MORE CAREFUL. MY FATHER WON'T KNOW.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK, NOT ANYMORE.
LYING TO HIM, GOING BEHIND HIS BACK,
WE'VE DONE ENOUGH OF THAT.
THE TRUTH IS, ISABELLE,
I KIND OF TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOU,
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.
YOU ARE SO SWEET THE WAY YOU WORRY ABOUT ME.
I DON'T WANTTHIS RELATIONSHIP TO END.
SO IT'S NOT GOING TO.
[INSISTENT KNOCKING]
I NEED TO SEE HER.
PLEASE, CAN YOU TAKE ME TO SEE MY DAUGHTER ?
DIANA, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT REALLY MAIA YOU'D BE SEEING.
OH, I DON'T CARE.
TODAY I FOUND OUT THAT MY DAUGHTER, WHO I LOVED...
WAS SENT BACK INTO THE PAST,
AND DIED 150 YEARS AGO, AND I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE ME AWHILE
I JUST...
PLEASE, LET ME DO THIS.
I NEED TO SAY GOODBYE.
GIVE ME YOUR COAT.
I'LL PUT SOME COFFEE ON.
READY ?
MOMMY...
MOMMY, I'M STARVING.
CAN WE HAVE PANCAKES ?
I'LL HELP MAKE THEM.
OKAY.
WELL, I'LL NEED THE EGGS FROM THE FRIDGE...
AND BRING ME THE BIG PLASTIC BOWL.
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
OH, MY GOD.
ALANA ! ALANA !
ALANA, HONEY...
MY GOD, YOU'RE BLEEDING. ARE YOU OKAY ?
I-I THINK SO.
DIANA...
DIANA, CAN YOU HEAR ME ?
DIANA, LOOK AT ME. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ?
I THOUGHT I WAS BRINGING US OUT.
WELL, WHY ISN'T SHE AWAKE ?
I COULDN'T HOLD ON TO HER.
IT'S AS IF SHE PULLED AWAY.
THOMAS...
I THINK SHE'S STILL INSIDE THE DREAMWORLD.
HOW CAN SHE BE IN THERE WITHOUT YOU ?
I'M NOT SURE.
WHEN YOU AND I SEPARATE, WE LET GO OF THE ILLUSION,
BUT SHE'S NOT LETTING GO.
WHAT, SHE'S NOT COMING OUT ?
I THINK SHE'S HAPPY THERE WITH HER DAUGHTER,
AND SHE HAS NO INTENTIONOF EVER LEAVING.
OH, COME ON. COME ON...
AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHE'D SUFFERED
SOME KIND OF INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE,
BUT THE M.R.I. DIDN'T SHOW ANY BLEEDING IN THE BRAIN.
SO SHE HASN'T SUFFERED ANY DAMAGE ?
NOT YET,
BUT THE E.E.G WAS VERY TROUBLING.
HER BRAIN ACTIVITYIS FAR ABOVE NORMAL
AND CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE.
THE SAME IS TRUE FOR HER HEART RATE,
HER BREATHING, HER BLOOD PRESSURE.
THEY'RE ALL RED-LINING, IF YOU WILL.
ANY IDEA WHAT'S CAUSING IT ?
I REALLY CAN'T SAY AT THE MOMENT,
BUT HER METABOLIC RATE CAN'T STAY AT THIS LEVEL
FOR VERY LONG.
EVENTUALLY, HER ORGANS WILL FAIL.
WHAT, SHE COULD DIE ?
UNLESS WE CAN SLOW DOWN HER RATES,
WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY POOR OUTCOME.
DOES SHE HAVE ANY FAMILY ?
[SIGHS]
YEAH.
YOU SHOULD CALL THEM.
I NEED TO TALK TO HER. CAN YOU DO THAT ?
TAKE ME TO SEE DIANA.
PUSH ME A LITTLE, MOMMY.
HEY, I AM PUSHING YOU.
THEN MAKE IT HIGHER.
LOOK,NOTTOO HIGH.
BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE FUN.
SHE HAS A POINT.
I THOUGHT I'D BE SEEING YOU TWO.
I DIDN'T HURT YOU, DID I ?
IT FELT A LITTLE JARRING
WHEN YOU LEFT.
I'M FINE.
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE NOT.
WELL, THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG, BECAUSE I FEEL GREAT.
YOU'RE IN AN I.C.U, DIANA.
I THOUGHT I MIGHT END UP THERE.
WHAT'S MY HEART RATE ?
IS IT 170 ? 175 ?
THAT STILL PROBABLY GIVES ME, WHAT,
ANYWHERE FROM THREE WEEKS TO TWO MONTHS ?
THAT COULD BE FOREVER IN HERE.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE.
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN, TOM, I DO,
BUT REALLY,
I'D LIKE YOU TO LEAVE NOW, BOTH OF YOU.
LISTEN, DIANA, BELIEVE ME--
DON'T WALK AWAY.
THE FIRST TIME I CAME TO ONE OF THESE PLACES,
I NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE,
BUT I CAME TO REALIZE THIS IS NOT THE WORLD.
NONE OF THIS IS REAL,
INCLUDING...MAIA.
MOMMY, PUSH ME A LITTLE HARDER.
SHE'S REAL ENOUGH FOR ME.
WHEE !
OH, SHE'S NOT COMING BACK, IS SHE ?
SHE'S GOING TO DIE IN THERE.
THAT SEEMS TO BE HER PLAN.
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THIS IS MY FAULT.
I TOOK HER THERE.
NO, DON'T DO THAT TO YOURSELF.
YOU DIDN'T TAKE MAIA AWAY.
THE PEOPLE WHO DID THAT, THEY'RE TO BLAME.
MAYBE...
BUT THESE PEOPLE, THE FUTURE,
THEY DON'T SEEM TO CAREWHO THEY HURT,
DO THEY ?
NO, THEY DON'T.
4:00 IS FAST APPROACHING.
HAVE YOU COME TO A DECISION ?
DO I WANT TO GET IN BEDWITH A TERRORIST
OR GO TO WAR WITH ONE ?
THAT DOES APPEAR TO BE THE QUESTION.
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE,
YOU CAN COUNT ON MY SUPPORT.
ISABELLE ?
ISABELLE...
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SHAWN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I JUST CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU.
YOU CAN CARE ABOUT ME ALL YOU WANT.
JUST STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
YES, YOU ARE.
[INHALES SHARPLY]
[CHOKING]
ISABELLE...
AH !
[GASPING IN PAIN]
[CHOKING]
[GASPING AND CHOKING]
DADDY...
[GASPING]
DADDY...
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
OKAY...
IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING.
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE THE 4400 CAME BACK,
IT'S BEEN ONE SACRIFICE AFTER ANOTHER.
YOU, YOUR DAUGHTER,
MY SON....
IT HAS TO STOP.
SO I HAVE A PLAN.
I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOING TO WORK.
IT MIGHT BE THE STUPIDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE.
I KIND OF WISH YOU WERE HERE TO STOP ME,
BUT YOU'RE NOT,
AND I HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING.
MAYBE THIS IS GOOD BYE, MAYBE IT ISN'T.
THE JOB WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY FUN WITHOUT YOU.
OKAY, OKAY.
OKAY, THIS IS GOING TO WORK, RIGHT ?
IT WORKED, RIGHT ?
I'M-- I'M NOT DEAD.
NOT THIS TIME, NO.
NEXT TIME, YOU MIGHT NOT BE SO FORTUNATE.
THE CHILDREN YOU TOOK, MAIA AND THE OTHERS,
I WANT THEM BACK.
YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO REMEMBER THEM.
WE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS
TO ERASE THEM FROM YOUR MEMORY,
TO SPARE YOU ANY PAIN.
IT DIDN'T WORK.
IT APPEARS WE UNDERESTIMATED THE BONDS THEY HAD FORGED.
IT'S CALLED FAMILY.
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT ?
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TAKE THEM, TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT.
MAIA WAS ONLY 25 WHEN SHE DIED.
NOW, EITHER RETURN THE CHILDREN,
OR PUT THAT ROPE BACK AROUND MY NECK,
BECAUSE I'M DONE.
IN THAT CASE,
I NEED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
THEY'RE ALIVE.
YOU FORCED US TO GO BACK...
EXTRACT THEM FROM THE TIMELINE,
BUT RETURNING THEM TO YOU
WOULD BE A MISTAKE,
FOR OUR TIME,AND FOR YOURS.
THE 4400 WERE AN EXPERIMENT WE ALWAYS KNEW MIGHT FAIL.
THERE WERE SO MANY VARIABLES.
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THEM ALL.
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE,
TAKING THE 4400,SENDING THEM BACK,
IT HASN'T CHANGED ANYTHING ?
THE CATASTROPHE'S STILL COMING ?
OUR ENEMIES ARE MORE RESOURCEFUL
THAN WE IMAGINED.
ENEMIES ?
THERE ARE THOSE AMONG US
WHO WOULD PREFER HISTORY TO REMAIN UNCHANGED,
THAT THE 4400 FAIL IN THEIR MISSION.
YOU MEAN, THEY WANT HUMANITY TO DIE OUT ?
THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT THEY WILL SURVIVE.
NOT ONLY SURVIVE, BUT BENEFIT FROM THE CHAOS.
IF YOU THINK WE ARE HEARTLESS,
I ASSURE YOU THAT THE OTHER SIDE
IS UNIMAGINABLY MORE BRUTAL,
AND THEY'VE LET LOOSE A TERRIBLE EVIL INTO YOUR TIME.
SENDING THESE CHILDREN FURTHER BACK INTO THE TIMELINE
WAS AN ATTEMPT
TO COMBAT THAT EVIL.
IF WE RETURN THEM TO YOU,
ALL THE GOOD THAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST WILL BE NEGATED.
THE 4400
AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY WERE MEANT TO ACHIEVE
WILL BE IN JEOPARDY.
THIS EVIL,
THERE HAS TO BE SOME OTHER WAY TO DEAL WITH IT.
THERE IS.
YOU.
YOU ARE THE OTHER WAY.
IT'S A BURDEN THAT WE HAD HOPED NOT TO PLACE ON YOU.
IF YOU RETURN MAIA AND THE OTHERS,
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
WHAT WE WANT,YOU MAY NOT BE WILLING TO GIVE.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL OR NOT ?
WE DO,
BUT IT'S A DEAL I'M AFRAID YOU'LL COME TO REGRET.
[GASPING]
HELLO !
HELLO !
IS THERE ANYONE HERE ?
[FAINT VOICES MURMURING]
MAIA ?
[GASPS]
TOM !
MAIA...
MAIA...
IT'S OKAY.
HE WORKS WITH MY MOM.
WE WERE KIDNAPPED. WHERE IS SARA ?
[KIDS CLAMORING]
CAN WE GO HOME ? DID YOU CATCH HER ?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YES. SHH...
YOU'RE ALL GOING HOME.
IT'S OVER. YOU'RE ALL SAFE NOW.
IS MY MOM HERE ?
SHE'S NOT HERE,
BUT I'LL TAKE YOU TO HER, OKAY ?
[CLOCK TICKING]
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
HELLO.
HAS HE ARRIVED YET ?
[SIGHS]
THEN HE'S MADE MY CHOICE FOR ME.
[EXHALES]
[FAINT WHISPERS ECHOING]
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING ?
COME ON...
I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING ME.
I KNOW YOU'RE LISTENING.
[WHISPERS ECHOING]
I FOUND YOU.
I FOUND YOUR BUG.
I FOUND YOUR STUPID LITTLE BUG.
OKAY, SWEETIE, LIGHTS OUT.
IT'S STILL EARLY.
IT'S 9:30,AND IT'S TIME FOR BED.
OKAY, BUT FIRST I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.
MAIA, NO STALLING.
MOMMY, PLEASE. IT WON'T TAKE LONG.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SHUT YOUR EYES.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, WELL, THEY'RE SHUT.
NOW WHAT ?
MAIA ?
I'M HERE, MOMMY.
YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES NOW.
MOMMY ?
WAKE UP.
IT'S OKAY.
I'M BACK.
EVERYTHING'S FINE...
BUT YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP.
MOMMY, PLEASE, WAKE UP.
PLEASE...
MAIA ?
MAIA ?
[SIGHS HAPPILY]
Over the last 60 years 4400 people
have been abducted
All at once they were returned
With no memory of where they've been
they haven't aged a day
And some have returned with new abilities
All are trying to reconnect....
...with a life interrupted
We're not a threat.We're salvation.
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
I see you've been spending
people see her,they see a woman,
a beautiful woman,
and they might forget that inside,
she's just a little girl.
I'm glad she has you around to be a friend.
You killed people.That's not what we
discussed when you approached me.
We are in a war.
It's going to cost money.
You sold us out.
I'm very disappointed in you,
shawn.
I'm afraid I can't forgive you.
Diana skouris,your adoption of maia
rutledge is hereby complete,legal,and binding.
Ms. Skouris,my name is sara.
I'm maia's sister.
Do you see the future more clearly
since you stopped taking the inhibitor?
- Who are you?
- I'm lindsey.
I'm a part of her collection.
We all are.
Tyler! Duncan!
You've been here ever since you walked
through the front door of my house.
You're in the future.We had to bring you here,
maia,you and your friends.
Before we put you back in your new time,
we'll make you forget your mother.
Please,don'T.
They'll forget you,too.
Hey.
Oh,marco,they're beautiful.
How did you know i like anemones?
You remember that bad italian restaurant?
I asked you what your favorite flower was,
and you said...
anemones.
Most guys don't even listen to table talk.
You not only heard me,you remembered.
Do you know how lucky you're
going to get tonight?
Ah,then my plan is working.
I thought it was just going to be the two of us.
It is.
Then who's the other plate for?
Di?
I don't know
what I was thinking.
- You having fun?
- Of course i'm having fun.
- You sure you don't want a turn at the wheel?
- It's your fantasy.
Okay,honey. Hold on.
Look out!
- You all right?
- I think so.
- You saw her,too,right?
- Of course I did.
Why would a little girl be standing
in the middle of the road?
I have no idea.
A joy ride in the country,that's
what we agreed on,right?
A great car,a deserted road.
Hitting some kid at 80 miles plus...
where the hell does that come in?
What happened to her?
Thomas...
hey!
Hey! Hey...
hey...
are you okay?
Who was she?
I have no idea.

Season 03 Episode 05</font>
So long ago,
another life
I can feel your heart beat
it's not a dream
remember us
I can see it in your eyes
we'll find our place in time
our place in time
beyond the sun
we'll find our place in time
our place in time
to call our own
<font color="#ffff00">sync: gagegao
-=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font>
How many times have we gone away together
in one of these fantasy worlds you create?
A dozen times,
two dozen?
- At least.
- And these worlds,they always feel real.
Except this time,a girl without a face
appears out of nowhere.
It felt more like a nightmare.
But something like that
was bound to happen sooner or later.
I build these worlds
out of our memories,
I guess this time I dredged up
something incomplete.
A fragment of something,
a sort of mental hiccup.
Okay,but this girl,
is she part of my memory or yours?
Yours,mine,both...
there's no way to know,is there?
One of us might have seen
her picture in a book.Or seen her in the street.
We just don't remember her face.
It might have just been a glimpse.
A glimpse pretty much
ruined our night.
Well,tomorrow night
will be better,I promise.
Anywhere you want to go,anywhere we want to go,
and anything we want to do.
You know,for his 12th birthday,
I took kyle fishing up at the dosewallips river.
I thought maybe
the three of us could go there.
That sounds great.
And maybe this time,we could actually
catch some fish.
Okay.
I don't know what's wrong
with my bedroom...
or yours for that matter.
We've already done it there
a bunch of times.
Experts say you should do adventurous things
to keep relationships more interesting.
They say that,huh?
What could be more adventurous
than a quickie on the staircase?
Did you switch from encyclopedia britannica
to cosmo magazine or something?
Well,I read lots of stuff.
I'll take the elevator.
Devon...
how embarrassing for her.
Isabelle,just stop.Just...
What's the matter,shawn?
What's wrong?
She's not going to tell my father.
- She'd be too afraid of me.
- Isabelle,
she's going to tell someone,
and they'll tell someone else,
and then
everybody's going to know.
Where's your partner?
Late.
A 4400,christopher dubov,XXXXXXXXX
I want to know if we're looking
at a hate crime.
It says here he's a lawyer
at teller and dutch.
That's a major mergers
and acquisitions firm.
They've been all over
the financial pages this year.
Yeah,which makes him a high-profile 4400.
An easy target for somebody looking to make a point.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
His 4400 status isn't the only motive
someone might have to attack him.
Just talk to him.See if he can
write you up a list.
alarm clock need new batteries?
No,it's a crappy morning.
You opening up a newsstand?
No,just A... project i'm working on.
So,what do we got?
Yeah,you could call it
a hate crime.
My son michael
certainly hates me.
Your son did this to you,
mr. Dubov?
His mom and i split up.
He blames me.
I'm the one who introduced her to bob,
her new husband.
I knew they belonged together.
I could smell it.
- I'm not sure I follow.
- It's my ability.
It showed up once I stopped
taking the promicin inhibitor.
I can smell pheromones.
You mean the stuff people put out
to attract other people?
Weird,huh?
Things between my wife and i
haven't been too good for a while.
Then I met bob.He's my new dentist.
Right away,there was something
familiar about him.
Then I realized what it was.
He smelled just like caroline.
So I made her an appointment.
I had to know whether or not
they belonged together.
Let me guess--
love at first sight.
Sight,smell,whatever.
You and your son
look very happy together.
Those were taken
when michael was 10.
10...
that's A...
that's a great age.
Mr. Dubov...
do you want us to talk to michael?
Assault is a serious crime?
Forget it.I'm sorry
my secretary called you.
Besides,I think I know a way to get him to
forgive me.There's a new bar around the corner.
One of the waitresses,
she smells just like my kid.
- Let's hope she's not married.
- Amen to that.
You know,I bet if that guy quit his job
and opened up a dating service,he'd make a fortune.
Though I'm not sure how turning a corporate lawyer
into cupid is going to help save the future.
Hey...
honey,what's going on?
You all right?
Dubov was gone
for,like,five years,right?
I...
I bet his son really missed him.
Probably.
I mean,
every 4400 left someone behind.
Are you sure it's not
something else?
No...
it's fine,really.
It'll pass.
Okay...
physical...
you and isabelle.
You want to explain that?
I asked you a question! What exactly
is going on between you and my daughter?
We never planned
on going behind your back.
In fact,we never planned it at all.
It just kind of happened.
Friendship!
Remember,we talked about that.
That's as far as it was supposed to go.
I don't know what to say i'm sorry.
I'm sorry,too.
I'm sorry I ever trusted you.
Isabelle is just a child--
no,richard,she isn'T.
She's emotionally immature,
and you took advantage of that!
That's what you think?
You know me better than that.That's not fair.
XXXXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not going to make
that promise to you.
I am not giving you a choice here,
you understand me?
This thing between the two of you,
it is over.
I don't recall
saying "come in."
I thought perhaps a referee
might be in order.
May I advise you gentlemen
to go to your neutral corners?
This is a private conversation,matthew.
It may have started out that way,
but I assure you,it's becoming very public.
I could hear you out in the hallway,
and for the record,I happen to agree with richard.
This relationship with isabelle
is ill-advised at best.
I thought referees
didn't take sides.
If I were you,shawn,I'd take this opportunity
to make a graceful exit.
Think about what I said,shawn.
I'm expecting you to do the right thing.
What's for lunch?
Prosciutto with figs.
Rosemary chicken,couscous,
and raspberries.
You know,when kyle and i used to go fishing,we'd take a half a dozen
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and think we were living like kings.
Well,I like to think the reality I create
is a little bit tastier than that.
Good.
Hey,we ought to get going.
Hey,kyle!
Come on,buddy!
Let's get moving!
Come on...
it's you.
The girl in the road.
That's right.
You remember.
Maia.
Maia...
have we met before?
Don't be silly.
No,no,I'm sorry.I-I don't remember you.
Sure you do.Think harder.
Is that why you keep showing up?
Because you want me to remember?
I'm here because you brought me here.
There has to be a reason why this girl
keeps showing up.
There was nothing familiar about her?
Nothing at all?
No...
but she kept acting
like we knew each other,
XXXXXXXXXXif I did bring her there,
then I must know her from somewhere.
Tom...
shouldn't you be at work?
Jarvis said you called in sick.
Well,I'm allowed.
Thanks for checking in on me.
Come on,diana.Talk to me.
What are you...
what the hell's all this?
It's just a project i'm working on.
I mentioned it to you.
- Who's this supposed to be?
- I wish I knew.
I know this might sound creepy,
but I was up all night
last night cutting out pictures of little girls,
and none of them seemed to be the right one.
I mean,I think I'm going crazy.
Then we both are.
You know those little
dream vacations I take with alana?
This little girl keeps showing up in them.
This little blonde girl,
says her... her name is maia.
Maia...
- oh,tom...
- what?
You have to come with me.
I have to show you something.
Who is she,tom?
Who is maia?
I don't know.
There's no mention of someone named maia
in any of our case files.
Okay,well,maybe we met her together
someplace else.
Maybe at one of garrity's barbecues.
No,that does not feel right.I didn't just meet this
girl once at a barbecue.I know her better than that.
All right,just calm down.
Well,there's a reason
this girl is haunting us,tom.
Okay,she's out there somewhere,
and she wants us to find her.
Well,right now the only place i know she  exists is
in one of these dreamworlds that alana and I create.
Well,then I need for alana
to take me there.
I need to meet this girl,talk to her.
No,but you wouldn't really
be talking to her,diana.
You'd just be talking to whatever
your subconscious remembers of her.
Well,maybe that would be enough
for me to figure out who she is.
How do I sound?
Like you've been
playing for years.
But I haven'T.
It's my first time.
I kind of figured that.
Isabelle,you have a minute?
Have a seat.
isabelle,you know
i'm proud of you,don't you?
This is about shawn and i
having sex,isn't it?
That-- that's part of it,yeah,yeah,
but only part of it.
Right now,everything is new to you.
You're learning so much,so fast.
How to be A...
a daughter...
- a friend--
- a lover.
That part you might be learning
a little too fast--
XXXXXXXXXXXXX
I would just like it
if you and shawn slowed down--
- stopped sleeping together?
- For the time being.
There's no reason to stop.
Shawn cares about me.
I care about shawn.
The sex is wonderful.
It makes us both very happy.
It should make you happy,too.
Maybe it should,but it doesn'T.
I suppose that's normal.
But everything's going to be okay.
Shawn would never do anything to hurt me.
He's way too smart for that.
So you see?You have nothing
to worry about.
I wonder if anyone at the center
has a cello.
So,what do I have to do?
- Well,the main thing is to relax.
- Oh,my god.
I usually close my eyes
and count backwards from 10.
Before I reach zero,
we're somewhere else.
Do you have any idea
where you want alana to take you?
We usually have a destination
picked out.
Well,wherever maia is.
I mean,you can do that,can't you?
You can take me to her.
She seems to show up any place we go.
So it's really up to you.
All right,well,let's just keep it simple.
How about my apartment?
All right.
Now,let's begin.
Alana...
this is not my apartment.
I know.I'm not quite sure
what just happened.
You done talking to your friend?
- You're maia.
- Stop fooling around.
Come on. He's waiting for us.
There you are,
ms. Skouris.
The documents
are all ready.
If you'll just have a seat
and sign where indicated,we can finish up.
CONSENT TO ADOPTION BY GUARDIA
You still want to do this...
don't you?
Diana skouris,your adoption of maia rutledge
is hereby complete,legal,and binding.
So witnessed by me,henry biederman,
of the tenth circuit family court of seattle.
You know,some of us have to look far and
wide to find the people we'll call family.
You two had to look
clear across time.
Diana,let me introduce you
to your daughter maia.
Maia,say hello to mommy.
Oh,my god,maia...
oh,my god...
- my god...
- diana,what happened?
She was kidnapped,tom.
She was taken by a woman pretending
to be her sister.
She took maia,tyler downing,lindsey hammond,
and a whole bunch of 4400 kids.
Do you remember any of this?
No. No,I don'T.
So this woman took these children,and somehow
made everyone forget they ever existed?
Yes,but they existed.Maia rutledge disappeared
from crescent city,california march 3rd,1946.
Wait,you're saying she was abducted,
then returned with the other 4400,then taken again,
and none of us remember this
but you?
- It's like they've wiped all our memories.
- But why?
Because they didn't
want us looking for them.
The 4400 were taken and returned
to change the future in some way,
and maybe maia and the others were taken so that they
could change it again,but I don't know,and I don't care.
All I know is that four days ago,
she was here with me,
and I need you to believe
that I have a daughter named maia,
and that she's been taken from me.
I don't remember maia,
or the kidnapping,or any of it,
and the idea that my memory's
been messed with scares the hell out of me,
but after everything we've been through
with the 4400,
yes,diana...
I believe you.
- Hello.
- Richard tyler?
Yes. Who is this?
My name is daniel armand.
You know who I am?
Of the nova group?
I think it's time you and I met,richard.
We have a lot to discuss.
I have a lot i'd like to say to you,too,
but I don't think you're going to want to hear it.
Now,you see,that's the problem,right there.
We should be allies,not adversaries.
My group and your organization
have the same goal.
We're advocating
for the rights of the 4400.
Except that you advocate
through assassination and intimidation.
We lack the strength of numbers,richard,
so we use the tools at our disposal.
Is that what you called me for?
To have a debate?
I called to arrange a truce,
and to talk about shawn farrell.
You going to make
more threats against him?
No,we need to discuss
his future,richard.
Because unless you and i
can come to some kind of an agreement,
I'm not sure he's going to have one.
He says I should meet him
on the corner of pike and gorch thursday at 4:00.
And then?
A car will be there to pick me up and take
me someplace for a face-to-face with armand.
Sounds to me like the nova group's
been reading too much john lecarre.
- What did you say?
- I told him i'd think about it.
What is there to think about?
You're not going.
Whoa,let's not rush to judgment.
I've dealt with this guy before,
remember?
He wants one thing.
You know what it is.
Money,and probably the names and addresses
of every 4400 in our computer.
If they have an ability that he can use,
he will exploit it,and people will die.
People have already died.
Maybe I can stop it.
What,are you going to
make him see the light?
No,but maybe I could stop him
from killing you.
How?
How?
By putting this place and everything
that we've worked for in jeopardy?
I won't let you do that.
Noble words,shawn,but may I remind you
if the nova group wants to strike at you,
I don't think there's any way
we can prevent it.
Thank you for the pep talk,matthew.
Just being realistic.
So am I.If I don't show,it's like a declaration of war,
and we all know who the first casualty will be.
You and jordan collier built this place.
You're its heart and soul.
Then listen to me,richard.
I tried to deal with these people before.
It was a disaster.
I'm warning you...
I'm asking you...
please do not make
the same mistake.Please.
Skouris,I have a list right here of every 4400
who returned that night to highland beach.
There's no maia rutledge,there's no
tyler downing,there's no lindsey hammond.
I've explained that.
They've been erased.
From the records,
from our memories.
Someone has tried to wipe out
every trace of them.
We talked to the families.In the last week,all of them have been
haunted by phantom memories of children they supposedly lost years ago.
Okay,let's say for a minute
that I am buying any of this,
and I'm not,but if I did,
we don't even know where they were taken.
The future?
That's kind of out of our jurisdiction.
I've seen maia.I've spoken to her.
We both have.
Okay,look,you are asking me
to commit manpower and resource XXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXyou guys play around in.
Look,I'm sorry,but I can't do it.
Uh,you guys
through?
Because I think I found
your kids.
Here we go.
Watch this.
That's him.
That's tyler.
It's dated september 19th,1893.
They sent him back
further into the past?Why?
Well,that,I can't tell you.
But tyler downing did graduate first in his class
from yale university in engineering.
I knew i'd heard the name before.
In 1915,he helped develop
synthetic petroleum.
You drove to work this morning
because of this guy.
Lindsey hammond.
June 11th,1918.
This is from the estate of robert goddard.
You know,the rocket guy?
He adopted an orphan named lindsey hammond.
XXXXXXXXEventually worked in his lab,
and she invented all the composite materials
used in the first lunar colonies.
Okay,so,what about maia?
Did you find any photos of her?
Uh,no,she...she was a little harder
to track down,
but,uh,
I finally found something.
That's maia's
handwriting.
It's a diary,
from maia rutledge.
Dated april 19th
through september 2nd,1847.
It was written while she was part of a wagon
train making its way along the oregon trail.
I'm sorry,she crossed the rockies
in a covered wagon?
Uh...no.
She died of smallpox
in october of '47.
She was 25.
No,I'm sorry,shawn,
but it's not my father's decision,it's mine,
and I'm not breaking up with you.
It's got nothing to do with your dad.
Not really.
You and I made some decisions.
We did some things.
We did what we wanted to do,and there's
no reason we can't keep doing that.
We'll be more careful.
My father won't know.
That's not going to work,
not anymore.
Lying to him,going behind his back,
we've done enough of that.
The truth is,isabelle,
I kind of took advantage of you,
and I'm really sorry.
You are so sweet
the way you worry about me.
I don't want
this relationship to end.
So it's not going to.
I need to see her.
Please,can you take me
to see my daughter?
Diana,you know it's not really
maia you'd be seeing.
Oh,I don't care.
Today I found out
that my daughter,who I loved...
was sent back into the past,
and died 150 years ago,and I'm sorry,
but that's going to
take me awhile i just...
please,let me do this.
I need to say goodbye.
Give me your coat.
I'll put some coffee on.
Ready?
Mommy...
mommy,I'm starving.
Can we have pancakes?
I'll help
make them.
Okay.
Well,I'll need the eggs
from the fridge...
and bring me
the big plastic bowl.
Oh,my god.
Alana! Alana!
Alana,honey...
my god,you're bleeding.Are you okay?
I-I think so.
Diana...diana,can you
hear me?
Diana,look at me.
What the hell happened?
I thought I was bringing us out.
Well,why isn't she awake?
I couldn't hold on to her.
It's as if she pulled away.
Thomas...I think she's still
inside the dreamworld.
How can she be in there
without you?
I'm not sure.
When you and I separate,
we let go of the illusion,
- but she's not letting go.
- What,she's not coming out?
I think she's happy there
with her daughter,
and she has no intention
of ever leaving.
Oh,come on.
At first I thought she'd suffered
some kind of intracerebral hemorrhage,
but the M.R.I. Didn't show
any bleeding in the brain.
So she hasn't
suffered any damage?
Not yet,but the E.E.G.
Was very troubling.
Her brain activity is far above normal
and continues to accelerate.
The same is true for her heart rate,
her breathing,her blood pressure.
They're all red-lining,
if you will.
Any idea what's causing it?
I really can't say at the moment,but her metabolic
rate can't stay at this level for very long.
Eventually,
her organs will fail.
What,she could die?
Unless we can slow down her rates,
we're looking at a very poor outcome.
Does she have any family?
Yeah.
You should call them.
I need to talk to her.
Can you do that?Take me to see diana.
- Push me a little,mommy.
- Hey,I am pushing you.
Then make it higher.
Look,not
too high.
But that's
the whole fun.
She has a point.
I thought I'd beseeing you two.
I didn't hurt you,did I?
It felt a little jarring when you left.
- I'm fine.
- You,on the other hand,are not.
Well,that's where you're wrong,
because I feel great.
You're in an I.C.U.,Diana.
I thought I might end up there.
What's my heart rate?
Is it 170? 175?
- Higher
- That still probably gives me,what,
anywhere from three weeks to two months?
- That could be forever in here.
- You're talking about suicide.
I appreciate your concern,tom,
I do,
but really,I'd like you to leave now,
both of you.
Listen,diana,believe me--
don't walk away.
The first time I came to one of these places,
I never wanted to leave,
but I came to realize
this is not the world.
None of this is real,
including...maia.
Mommy,push me a little harder.
She's real enough for me.
Oh,she's not
coming back,is she?
She's going to
die in there.
That seems to be her plan.
I can't help but think this is my fault.
I took her there.
No,don't do that to yourself.
You didn't take maia away.
The people who did that, they're to blame.
Maybe...
but these people,
the future,
they don't seem to care
who they hurt,do they?
No,they don'T.
4:00 is fast approaching.
Have you come to a decision?
Do I want to get in bed
with a terrorist or go to war with one?
That does appear to be the question.
Whatever you decide,you can count on my support.
Isabelle?
Isabelle...
my relationship with shawn
has nothing to do with you.
That's not true.I just care about
what happens to you.
You can care about me all you want.
Just stay out of my business.
- I'm not going to do that.
- Yes,you are.
Isabelle...
Daddy...
Daddy...
I'm sorry.
Okay...
it's all right,baby.
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I've been thinking.
You know,ever since the 4400 came back,
it's been one sacrifice after another.
You,your daughter,my son....
it has to stop.
So I have a plan.
I'm not sure it's going to work.
It might be the stupidest thing
i've ever done.
I kind of wish you were here to stop me,
but you're not,and I have to
try something.
Maybe this is goodbye,
maybe it isn'T.
The job wouldn't have been
any fun without you.
Okay,okay.
Okay,this is going to work,
right?
It worked,right?
I'm-- I'm not dead.
Not this time,no.Next time,
you might not be so fortunate.
The children you took,
maia and the others,I want them back.
You were never meant
to remember them.
We went to great lengths to erase
them from your memory,to spare you any pain.
It didn't work.
It appears we underestimated
the bonds they had forged.
It's called family.
Are you familiar with the concept?
You had no right to take them,
treat people like that.
Maia was only 25 when she died.
Now,either return the children,or put that
rope back around my neck,because I'm done.
In that case,
I need to show you something.
They're alive.
You forced us to go back...
extract them from the timeline,
but returning them to you would be a mistake,
for our time,and for yours.
The 4400 were an experiment
we always knew might fail.
There were so many variables.
It was impossible to predict them all.
So you're telling me
everything you've done,
taking the 4400,sending them back,
it hasn't changed anything?
The catastrophe's still coming?
Our enemies are more resourceful
than we imagined.
Enemies?
There are those among us
who would prefer history to remain unchanged,
that the 4400 fail in their mission.
You mean,
they want humanity to die out?
They are convinced
that they will survive.
Not only survive,
but benefit from the chaos.
If you think we are heartless,I assure you
that the other side is unimaginably more brutal,
and they've let loose
a terrible evil into your time.
Sending these children further back into the
timeline was an attempt to combat that evil.
If we return them to you,all the good that
they've done in the past will be negated.
The 4400 and everything that they were
meant to achieve will be in jeopardy.
This evil,there has to be
some other way to deal with it.
There is.
You.
You are the other way.
It's a burden that we had hoped
not to place on you.
If you return maia and the others,
I'll do whatever you want.
What we want,
you may not be willing to give.
Do we have a deal or not?
We do,but it's a deal I'm afraid
you'll come to regret.
Hello!
Hello!
Is there anyone here?
Tom Baldwin
Maia?
- Tom!
- Maia...
maia...
it's okay.
He works with my mom.
- We were kidnapped.
- Where is sara?
- Can we go home?
- Did you catch her?
Yeah,yeah,yeah.
Yes. Shh... you're all going home.
It's over.
You're all safe now.
- Is my mom here?
- She's not here,
but I'll take you to her,okay?
Hello.
Has he arrived yet?
Then he's made my choice for me.
Where are you hiding?
Come on...
I know you're watching me.
I know you're listening.
I found you.
I found your bug.
I found your stupid little bug.
Okay,sweetie,
lights out.
It's still early.
It's 9:30,
and it's time for bed.
Okay,but first I need you
to do something for me.
Maia,
no stalling.
Mommy,please.It won't take long.
All you have to do is shut your eyes.
All right.Okay,well,they're shut.
Now what?
Maia?
I'm here,mommy.
You can open your eyes now.
Mommy?
Wake up.
It's okay.
I'm back.
Everything's fine...
but you have to wake up.
Mommy,please,wake up.
Please...
maia?
Maia?

Kill Isabelle!
<font color="#ffff00">4400
Season 03 Episode 05</font>
We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
I see you've been spending
a lot of time With ShaWn,
People see her, they see a woman.
A beautiful woman.
And they might forget that inside
she's just a little girl.
I'm glad she has you around
to be a friend,
You killed people.
That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.
We are in a war.
It's gonna cost money.
You sold us out.
I'm very disappointed in you, Shawn,
and I'm afraid I can't forgive you.
Diana Skouris,
your adoption of Maia Rutledge
is hereby complete,
legal, and binding,
Ms. Skouris, my name is Sarah.
I'm Maia's sister.
Do you see the future more clearly
since you stopped taking the inhibitor?
- Who are you?
- I'm Lindsey.
I'm a part of her collection.
We all are.
Tyler! Duncan!
You've been here
ever since you Walked
through the front door of my house,
You're in the future.
We had to bring you here, Maia,
you and your friends.
Before we put you back
in your new time,
we'll make you forget your mother.
Please, don't!
They'll forget you too,
Hey.
Marco, they're beautiful.
How did you know I like anemones?
You remember
that bad ltalian restaurant?
I asked you what your favorite
flower was, and you said:
Anemones.
Most guys don't even listen
to table talk.
You not only heard me,
you remembered.
Do you know how lucky
you're gonna get tonight?
Then my plan is working.
I thought it was just gonna be
the two of us.
It is.
Then who is the other plate for?
Di?
I don't know what I was thinking.
- Are you having fun?
- Of course, I'm having fun.
You sure you don't want
a turn at the wheel?
It's your fantasy.
Okay, honey. Hold on.
Look out!
- You all right?
- I think so.
- You saw her too, right?
- Of course, I did.
Why would a girl
be in the middle of the road?
- I have no idea.
- A joy ride in the country.
That's what we agreed on, right?
A great car, a deserted road.
Hitting some kid at 80 miles plus?
Where the hell does that come in?
What happened to her?!
Thomas.
Hey!
Hey. Hey.
Hey, what...? You...?
You okay?
Who was she?
I have no idea.
How many times
have we done this?
Gone away in one
of these fantasy worlds you create?
- A dozen times? Two dozen?
- At least.
And these worlds,
they always feel real.
Except this time, a girl without a face
appears out of nowhere.
It felt more like a nightmare.
But something like that was bound
to happen sooner or later.
I build these worlds
out of our memories.
I guess this time I dredged up
something incomplete.
A fragment of something.
A sort of mental hiccup.
Okay, but this girl?
Is she part of my memory or yours?
Yours, mine, both.
There's no way to know, is there?
One of us might have
seen her picture in a book,
or seen her in the street.
Yeah, we just
don't remember her face.
It might have just been a glimpse.
Yeah, well,
that glimpse pretty much
ruined our night.
Well, tomorrow night will be better.
I promise.
Anywhere you wanna go,
anywhere we wanna go,
- and anything we wanna do.
- You know, for his 1 2th birthday
I took Kyle fishing
up at the Dosewallips River.
I thought maybe the three
of us could go there.
That sounds great.
And maybe this time we could
actually catch some fish.
Okay.
I don't know what's wrong
with my bedroom.
Or yours for that matter.
We've already done it there
a bunch of times.
Experts say you should do
adventurous things
to keep relationships
more interesting.
They say that, huh?
What could be more adventurous
than a quickie in the staircase?
Did you switch
from Encyclopaedia Britannica
to Cosmo magazine or something?
What--?
Well, I read lots of stuff.
- I'll take the elevator.
- Devon.
How embarrassing for her.
Isabelle, just stop! Just...
What's the matter, Shawn?
What's wrong?
She's not gonna tell my father.
- She'd be too afraid of me.
- lsabelle.
She's gonna tell someone,
and then they'll tell someone else.
And then, everybody's gonna know.
Where's your partner?
Late.
A 4400, Christopher Dubov, was
attacked outside his home last night.
I wanna know if we're looking
at a hate crime.
It says he's a lawyer
at Teller and Dutch.
That's a major mergers
and acquisitions firm.
They've been all over
the financial pages this year.
Yeah, which makes him
a high profile 4400.
A target for somebody
looking to make a point.
No, it makes him a corporate raider
who's put a lot of people
in the unemployment line.
His 4400 status isn't the only motive
someone might have to attack him.
Just talk to him.
See if he can write you up a list.
- Oh, alarm clock need new batteries?
- No, it's a crappy morning.
Are you opening up a newsstand?
No. Just a project
that I'm working on.
So, what do we got?
Yeah, you could call it a hate crime.
My son, Michael, certainly hates me.
Your son did this to you, Mr. Dubov?
His mom and I split up.
He blames me.
I'm the one who introduced her to Bob,
her new husband.
I knew they belonged together.
I could smell it.
- I'm not sure I follow.
- It's my ability.
It showed up once I stopped taking
the promicin inhibitor.
I can smell pheromones.
You mean the stuff people put out
to attract other people?
- Weird, huh?
- Things between my wife and l
haven't been too good for a while.
Then I met Bob.
He's my new dentist.
Right away, there was
something familiar about him.
Then I realized what it was.
He smelled just like Caroline.
So I made her an appointment.
I had to know whether
or not they belonged together.
Let me guess, love at first sight.
Sight, smell, whatever.
You and your son
look very happy together.
Those were taken
when Michael was 1 0.
Ten.
That's a... That's a great age.
Mr. Dubov, do you want us
to talk to Michael?
Explain to him that assault
is a serious crime?
No, forget it.
I'm sorry my secretary called you.
Besides, I think I know a way
to get him to forgive me.
There's a new bar
around the corner.
One of the waitresses,
she smells just like my kid.
Let's hope she's not married.
Amen to that.
You know, I bet if that guy quit his job
and opened up a dating service,
he'd make a fortune.
I'm not sure how turning
a corporate lawyer into cupid
is gonna help save the future.
Wha--? Hey.
Honey, what's going on?
- Are you all right?
- Dubov was gone for five years, right?
I...
I bet his son really missed him.
Probably.
I mean, every 4400
left someone behind.
Are you sure
it's not something else?
No. It's fine, really.
It'll pass.
Okay.
Physical.
You and lsabelle?
You wanna explain that?
I asked you a question! What is going
on between you and my daughter?!
We never planned
on going behind your back.
In fact, we never planned it at all.
It just kind of happened.
Friendship! Remember?
We talked about that.
That's as far as it
was supposed to go!
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I'm sorry I ever trusted you.
- lsabelle is just a child!
- No, Richard, she isn't.
She's emotionally immature
and you took advantage of that!
That's what you think?
You know me better. That's not fair.
I know your judgment stinks,
that's what I know.
You're gonna stay away
from my daughter.
I'm not gonna make
that promise to you.
I am not giving you a choice here,
you understand me?
This thing between the two of you,
it is over.
I don't recall saying "come in."
I thought perhaps a referee
might be in order.
May I advise you gentlemen
to go to your neutral corners?
This is a private conversation,
Matthew!
It may have started out that way, but
I assure you, it's becoming very public.
I could hear you out in the hallway.
And for the record,
I happen to agree with Richard.
This relationship with lsabelle
is ill-advised at best.
I thought referees didn't take sides?
If I were you, Shawn, I'd take this
opportunity to make a graceful exit.
Think about what I said, Shawn.
I'm expecting you to do
the right thing.
What's for lunch?
Prosciutto with figs.
Rosemary chicken,
couscous, and raspberries.
Wow. You know,
when Kyle and I used to go fishing,
we'd take a half a dozen
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches
- and think we were living like kings.
- I like to think the reality I create
is a little bit tastier than that.
Good.
Hey, we gotta get going. Hey, Kyle!
Come on, buddy!
Come on, Kyle. Let's go.
Come on--
It's you.
The girl on the road.
That's right. You remember.
Maia.
Maia.
Have we met before?
Don't be silly.
No, I'm sorry, l...
I don't remember you.
Sure you do.
Think harder.
Is that why you keep showing up?
Because you want me
to remember?
I'm here because
you brought me here.
There has to be a reason
why this girl keeps showing up.
There was nothing familiar about her?
Nothing at all?
No.
But she kept acting
like we knew each other.
And if she's right,
if I did bring here there,
then I must know her
from somewhere.
Tom.
Shouldn't you be at work?
- Jarvis said you called in sick.
- Well, I'm allowed.
Thanks for checking in on me.
Diana, talk to me, will you?
What the hell's all this?
Just a project I'm working on.
I mentioned it to you.
- Who's this supposed to be?
- I wish I knew.
I know this might sound creepy,
but I was up all night last night
cutting up pictures of little girls. None
of them seemed to be the right one.
I mean, I think I'm going crazy.
Then we both are.
You know those little dream vacations
I take with Alana?
This little girl keeps showing up
in them. This little blond girl.
Says her name is Maia.
Maia?
- Oh, Tom.
- What?
You have to come with me.
I have to show you something.
Who is she, Tom?
Who is Maia?
I don't know.
I've already checked. There's no
mention of Maia in any of our case files.
Okay, well, maybe we met her
together someplace else?
Maybe at one
of Garrity's barbecues?
No, that does not feel right.
I didn't just meet this girl once
at a barbecue.
I know her better than that.
All right, just calm down.
Well, there's a reason this girl
is haunting us, Tom, okay?
She's out there somewhere,
and she wants us to find her.
Right now the only place
I know she exists
is in one of these dream worlds
Alana and I create.
Well then, I need for Alana
to take me there.
I need to meet this girl, talk to her.
No, but you wouldn't really
be talking to her, Diana.
You'd just be talking to whatever
your subconscious remembers of her.
Well, maybe that would be enough
for me figure out who she is.
How do I sound?
Like you've been playing for years.
I haven't. It's my first time.
I kind of figured that.
Isabelle, do you have a minute?
Have a seat.
Isabelle, you know I'm proud
of you, don't you?
This is about Shawn
and I having sex, isn't it?
That's part of it, yeah.
Yeah, but only a part of it.
Right now everything's new to you.
You're learning so much so fast.
How to be a daughter.
- A friend.
- A lover.
That part you might be learning
too fast.
You don't want me
to get my feelings hurt.
I would just like if you and Shawn
slow down.
- Stop sleeping together?
- For the time being.
There's no reason to stop.
Shawn cares about me.
I care about Shawn.
The sex is wonderful.
It makes us both very happy.
It should make you happy too.
Maybe it should, but it doesn't.
I suppose that's normal.
But everything is gonna be okay.
Shawn would never
do anything to hurt me.
He's way too smart for that.
So you see?
You have nothing to worry about.
I wonder if anyone at the Center
has a cello.
So, what do I have to do?
Well, the main thing is to relax.
Well, I usually close my eyes
and count backwards from ten.
Before I reach zero,
we're somewhere else.
Have any idea where you want
Alana to take you?
We usually have
a destination picked out.
Well, wherever Maia is.
You can do that, can't you?
You can take me to her?
She seems to show up
anyplace we go.
So it's really up to you.
Well, let's just keep it simple.
How about my apartment?
All right.
Now, let's begin.
Alana,
this is not my apartment.
I know. I'm not quite sure
what just happened.
You done talking to your friend?
- You're Maia.
- Stop fooling around.
Come on. He's waiting for us.
There you are, Ms. Skouris.
The documents are all ready.
If you'll just have a seat,
and sign where indicated,
we can finish up.
You still wanna do this, don't you?
Diana Skouris,
your adoption of Maia Rutledge
is hereby complete,
legal, and binding.
So witnessed by me,
Henry Biederman,
of the 1 0th Circuit Family Court
of Seattle.
You know, some of us
have to look far and wide
to find the people we'll call family.
You two had to look
clear across time.
Diana, let me introduce you
to your daughter, Maia.
Maia, say hello to Mommy.
Oh, my God, Maia.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- Diana, what happened?
She was kidnapped, Tom.
She was taken by a woman
pretending to be her sister.
She took Maia,
Tyler Downing, Lindsey Hammond,
and a whole bunch of 4400 kids.
Do you remember any of this?
No. No, I don't.
So this woman took these children
and somehow made everyone forget
they ever existed.
Yes, but they existed.
Maia Rutledge disappeared
from Crescent City, California,
March 3rd, 1 946.
So wait, you're saying
she was abducted,
then returned with the other 4400s,
then taken again.
And none of us remember this
but you.
- It's like they've wiped our memories.
- But why?
Because they didn't want us
looking for them.
The 4400 were taken and returned
to change the future in some way.
Maybe Maia and the others were taken
so that they could change it again.
I don't know and I don't care. All I know
is four days ago she was here with me.
And I need you to believe
that I have a daughter named Maia
and that she's been taken from me.
I don't remember Maia,
or the kidnapping, or any of it.
The idea that my memory's been
messed with scares the hell out of me.
But after everything
we've been through with the 4400,
yes, Diana, I believe you.
- Hello?
- Richard Tyler?
- Yes, who's this?
- My name is Daniel Armand,
- You knoW Who I am?
- With the NOVA Group?
I think it's time you and I met,
Richard.
We have a lot to discuss,
I have a lot to say to you too,
but I don't think you'll wanna hear it.
Well, now you see,
that's the problem right there.
We should be allies,
not adversaries,
My group and your organization
have the same goals,
We're advocating
for the rights of the 4400.
Except that you advocate
through assassination and intimidation.
We lack the strength in numbers,
Richard,
so we use the tools at our disposal.
Is that what you called me for?
To have a debate?
I called to arrange a truce,
And to talk about Shawn Farrell.
- You'll make more threats against him?
- No, we need to discuss his future.
Because unless you and I can come
to some kind of agreement,
I'm not sure he's gonna have one.
I should meet him on the corner
of Pike and Gorch Thursday at 4:00.
And then?
A car will be there to pick me up
and take me someplace
for a face to face with Armand.
Sounds to me like the NOVA Group's
been reading too much John le Carré.
- What did you say?
- I told him I'd think about it.
What is there to think about?
You're not going.
Let's not rush to judgment.
I've dealt with this guy before,
remember?
He wants one thing.
You know what it is: Money.
And probably the names
and addresses of every 4400
in our computer.
If they have an ability that he can use,
he will exploit it and people will die.
People have already died.
Maybe I can stop him.
Are you gonna make him
see the light?
No, but I can stop him
from killing you.
How? How?
By putting this place and everything
that we've worked for in jeopardy?
- I won't let you do that.
- Noble words, but may I remind you?
If the NOVA Group wants to strike
at you, I don't think we can prevent it.
Thank you for the pep talk, Matthew.
I'm just being realistic.
So am l. If I don't show,
it's like a declaration of war,
and we all know
who the first casualty will be.
You and Jordan Collier built this place.
You're its heart and soul.
Then listen to me, Richard.
I tried to deal
with these people before.
It was a disaster.
I'm warning you. I'm asking you:
Please do not make
the same mistake.
Please.
Skouris, I have a list right here
of ever 4400 who returned that night
to Highland Beach.
There's no Maia Rutledge.
There's no Tyler Downing.
There's no Lindsey Hammond.
I've explained that:
They've been erased.
From the records,
from our memories.
Someone has tried to wipe out
every trace of them.
We talked to the families.
In the last week,
all of them have been haunted
by phantom memories of children
they supposedly lost years ago.
Okay, let's say I am buying
any of this, and I'm not.
But if I did, we don't even know
where they were taken.
The future?
- That's kind of out of our jurisdiction.
- I've seen Maia.
I've spoken to her.
We both have.
Look, you're asking me
to commit manpower
and resources to find a little girl
that only exists
in some shared fantasyland
you guys play around in.
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't do it.
You guys through?
Because I think I found your kids.
Here we go. Watch this.
That's him. That's Tyler.
It's dated September 1 9th, 1 893.
They sent him back
further into the past. Why?
Well, that I can't tell you.
But Tyler Downing
did graduate first in his class
from Yale University in Engineering.
I knew I'd heard the name before.
In 1 91 5, he helped develop
synthetic petroleum.
You drove to work this morning
because of this guy.
This is from the estate
of Robert Goddard.
You know, the rocket guy.
He adopted an orphan
named Lindsey Hammond.
She lived with the family,
eventually worked in his lab.
And she invented
all the composite materials
used in the first lunar colonies.
Okay, so, what about Maia?
Did you find any photos of her?
No, she was a little harder
to track down.
But I finally found something.
That's Maia's handwriting.
It's a diary from Maia Rutledge
dated April 1 9th
through September 2nd, 1 847.
It was written while
she was part of a wagon train
making its way
along the Oregon Trail.
I'm sorry. She crossed the Rockies
in a covered wagon?
No.
She died of smallpox
in October of '47.
She was 25.
No. I'm sorry, Shawn.
It's not my father's decision.
- It's mine. I'm not breaking up with you.
- It's got nothing to do with your dad.
Not really.
You and I made some decisions,
we did some things.
We did what we wanted to do.
And there's no reason
we can't keep doing that.
We'll be more careful.
My father won't know it.
That's not gonna work.
Not anymore.
Lying to him, going behind his back?
We've done enough of that.
The truth is, lsabelle,
I kind of took advantage of you.
And I'm really sorry.
You are so sweet
the way you worry about me.
I don't want this relationship to end.
So it's not going to.
I need to see her.
Please, can you take me
to see my daughter?
Diana, you know it's not really Maia
you'd be seeing.
Oh, I don't care.
Today I found out that my daughter,
who I loved,
was sent back into the past
and died 1 50 years ago.
I'm sorry, but that's gonna take me
a while to come to terms with.
I just...
Please let me do this.
I need to say goodbye.
Give me your coat.
I'll put some coffee on.
Ready?
Mommy?
Mommy, I'm starving.
Can we have pancakes?
I'll help make them.
Okay.
Well, I'll need the eggs
from the fridge.
And bring me the big, plastic bowl.
Oh, my God. Alana! Alana! Alana!
Honey, my God, you're bleeding.
You okay?
I think so.
Diana. Diana, can you hear me?
Diana, look at me.
What the hell happened?!
I thought I was bringing us out.
Well, why isn't she awake?
I couldn't hold onto her.
It's as if she pulled away.
Thomas, I think she's still
inside the dream world.
Wait, how can she be in there
without you?
I'm not sure.
When you and I separate,
we let go of the illusion.
But she's not letting go.
Wha--? She's not coming out?
I think she's happy there
with her daughter,
and she has no intention
of ever leaving.
Oh, come on.
At first, I thought she'd suffered some
kind of intracerebral hemorrhage.
But the MRl didn't show
any bleeding in the brain.
So she hasn't suffered
any damage?
Not yet, but the EEG
was very troubling.
Her brain activity is far above normal
and continues to accelerate.
The same is true for her heart rate,
her breathing, her blood pressure.
They're all redlining, if you will.
Any idea what's causing it?
I really can't say at the moment.
Her metabolic rate can't stay
at this level for very long.
Eventually her organs will fail.
What, she could die?
Unless we can slow down her rates,
we're looking at a very poor outcome.
Does she have any family?
- Yeah.
- You should call them.
I need to talk to her, Alana.
Can you do that?
Take me to see Diana?
- Push me a little, Mommy.
- Okay, I'm pushing you.
Then make it higher.
Look, not too high.
But that's the whole fun.
She has a point.
I thought I'd be seeing you two.
I didn't hurt you, did l?
It felt a little jarring when you left.
- No, I'm fine.
- You, on the other hand, are not.
Well, that's where you're wrong,
because I feel great.
You're in an lCU, Diana.
I thought I might end up there.
What's my heart rate?
Is it 1 70? 1 75?
- Higher.
- That still probably gives me
what, anywhere from three weeks
to two months?
That could be forever in here.
You're talking about suicide.
I appreciate your concern,
Tom, I do.
But really, I'd like you to leave now.
Both of you.
Listen, Diana, believe--
Don't walk away.
The first time I came to these places,
I never wanted to leave.
But I came to realize,
this is not the world.
None of this is real.
Including Maia.
Mommy, push me a little harder.
She's real enough for me.
Oh, she's not coming back, is she?
She's going to die in there.
That seems to be her plan.
I can't help but think this is my fault.
I took her there.
No, don't do that to yourself.
You didn't take Maia away.
The people who did that,
they're to blame.
Maybe.
But these people in the future?
They don't seem to care
who they hurt, do they?
No, they don't.
Four o'clock is fast approaching.
Have you come to a decision?
Do I want to get in bed with a terrorist,
or go to war with one?
That does appear to be the question.
Whatever you decide,
you can count on my support.
Isabelle?
Isabelle?
My relationship with Shawn
has nothing to do with you.
That's not true. I just care
about what happens to you.
You can care about me all you want,
just stay out of my business.
I'm not gonna do that.
Yes, you are.
Isabelle...?
Daddy?
Daddy?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, move on.
It's all right, baby.
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I've been thinking.
Ever since the 4400 came back,
it's been one sacrifice after another.
You and your daughter.
My son.
It has to stop.
So I have a plan.
I'm not sure it's gonna work.
It might be the stupidest thing
I've ever done.
I kind of wish you were here
to stop me.
But you're not,
and I have to try something.
Maybe this is goodbye,
maybe it isn't.
The job wouldn't have been
any fun without you.
Okay, okay. Okay.
This is gonna work, right? Okay.
It worked, right?
I'm not dead.
Not this time, no.
Next time,
you might not be so fortunate.
The children you took,
Maia and the others.
I want them back.
You were never meant
to remember them.
We went to great lengths
to erase them from your memory
to spare you any pain.
It didn't work.
It appears we underestimated
the bonds they had forged.
It's called "family."
Are you familiar with the concept?
You had no right to take them,
treat people like that.
Maia was only 25 when she died.
Now, either return the children,
or put that rope back around my neck,
because I'm done.
In that case,
I need to show you something.
They're alive.
You forced us to go back,
extract them from the timeline.
But returning them to you
would be a mistake.
For our time, and for yours.
The 4400 were an experiment
we always knew might fail.
There were so many variables.
It was impossible to predict them all.
So you're telling me everything
you've done--
Taking the 4400, sending them back.
--it hasn't changed anything?
The catastrophe's still coming?
Our enemies are more resourceful
than we imagined.
Enemies?
There are those among us who would
prefer history to remain unchanged.
That the 4400 fail in their mission.
You mean they want
humanity to die out?
They are convinced
that they will survive.
Not only survive,
but benefit from the chaos.
If you think we are heartless,
I assure you, that the other side
is unimaginably more brutal.
And they've let loose
a terrible evil into your time.
Sending these children further back
into the timeline
was an attempt to combat that evil.
If we return them to you,
all the good that they have done
in the past will be negated.
The 4400 and everything
that they were meant to achieve
will be in jeopardy.
This evil, there has to be
some other way to deal with it.
There is.
You. You are the other way.
It's a burden that we had hoped
not to place on you.
If you return Maia and the others,
I'll do whatever you want.
What we want,
you may not be willing to give.
Do we have a deal or not?
We do. But it's a deal I'm afraid
you'll come to regret.
Hello?
Hello?
Is there anyone here?
Maia?
- Tom!
- Maia! Maia!
It's okay. He works with my Mom.
- We were kidnapped!
- Where's Sarah?
- Did you catch her?
- Can we go home now?
Yes. Yes, you guys.
- Where's my Mom?
- You're all going home.
It's over. You're all safe now.
Is my Mom here?
She's not here,
but I'll take you to her, okay?
Hello.
Has he arrived yet?
Then he's made my choice for me.
Where are you hiding? Come on!
I know you're watching me.
I know you're listening.
Where are you?
I found you. I found your bug.
I found your stupid little bug.
Okay, sweetie, lights out.
But it's still early.
It's 9:30, and it's time for bed.
Okay, but first I need you
to do something for me.
- Maia, no stalling.
- Mommy, please. It won't take long.
All you have to do is shut your eyes.
All right. Okay.
Well, they're shut. Now what?
Maia?
I'm here, Mommy.
You can open your eyes now.
Mommy?
Wake up.
It's okay.
I'm back.
Everything's fine.
But you have to wake up.
Mommy, please.
Wake up. Please.
Maia? Maia?
Durant les 60 dernières années
4400 personnes ont été enlevées...
Toutes sont revenues en même temps
Sans aucun souvenir d'où elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines sont revenues
avec de nouvelles capacités.
Tous essaient de renouer...
...avec une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le Salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans "les 4400"...
Je m'appelle Daniel Armand.
Sais-tu qui je suis ?
Du Nova Group ?
J'appelais pour proposer une trève
et discuter de Shawn Farrell.
Nous devons discuter de son futur,
parce que si vous et moi ne parvenons pas
à trouver un arrangement,
je ne suis pas sur qu'il en ait un.
Crois-moi, je sais quelle place j'ai consacrée
à mon mari et à mon fils.
Ils sont morts dans un accident de voiture
peu de temps avant que je sois enlevée.
Nos ennemis ont plus de ressources
que nous l'imaginons,
et ils ont envoyé un terrible fléau
dans votre époque.
Ce mal, il doit bien y avoir un autre moyen
de s'en débarasser ?
Il y en a un. Vous.
[Tue Isabelle]
Vous êtes l'autre moyen.
Oh, Tom. Bien. Tu es là.
Oui, comme tous les jours.
Eh bien, viens, on doit commencer.
Commencer quoi ?
Diana, je ne sais pas de quoi tu me parles.
Biensûr que si.
Viens. On y va.
Elle attend.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je l'ai amenée. Tu n'as plus qu'à le faire,
et on pourra reprendre notre journée.
"Le faire ?"
Non.
Pas question.
Je ne suis pas...
Tom, tu dois le faire. Ils te l'ont dit.
Je sais. C'est juste que...
Ils ne m'ont pas dit pourquoi.
Je ne sais pas si je peux le faire.
- Il se peut que je sois mauvaise.
Peut-être que je vais tuer beaucoup
de personnes.
Tu peux arrêter ça.
Je pourrais être responsable
de millions de morts,
à moins que tu fasses quelque chose.
Nous avons beaucoup de travail à faire
aujourd'hui.
Tout va bien, Tom.
Ca ne me gène pas.
Allez.
Prend l'aiguille.
Allez, Tom.
Fais-le.
Fais-le.
Je suis désolé.
Je ne le trouve pas...
Je ne trouve pas le mouchard...
Je ne le trouve pas...
Je sais que vous écoutez.
Je sais que vous l'avez mis quelque part
en moi.
Je vais le trouver.
Je ne le trouve pas.
Je ne trouve pas le mouchard.
Je ne le trouve pas.
Je ne trouve pas le mouchard.
Quelque part en moi.
Je sais que vous écoutez.
Je vais le trouver.
Je vais passer mon corps entier aux rayons X...
C'est Maia le loup !
C'est Maia le loup !
Je vais t'attraper, Amy !
Non.
Et si !
Maia...
Maia, ca va ?
Ca fait mal.
Je peux t'aider.
C'est juste une éraflure, Shawn.
Je peux te soigner.
Ca fait mal.
- Tu vas aller mieux.
Eh ! Laissez-la tranquille !
Vous lui faites mal !
A l'aide !
Arrêtez !
A l'aide !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Il est en train de la tuer !
Enlevez-le de là.
M. Farrell, lâchez-la.
Ecartez-vous d'elle !
Je ne comprends pas.
J'étais en train de la guérir.
Je la guérissais.
Chérie...
Salut, maman.
Comment vas-tu ?
Ca va.
Les signes vitaux de Maia sont bons.
Ils n'y a plus aucune séquelle.
Pour le moment, elle est juste déshydratée.
Chérie...
Maman ?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Pourquoi.. Shawn me voudrait-il du mal ?
Oh, mon Dieu...
C'est Shawn qui a fait ça ?
Il a raté des réunions hier, mais je ne pensais pas
qu'il allait si mal.
Comment va Shawn ?
Il va bien ?
Nous n'en savons rien.
Nous lui avons appelé un psychiatre.
Ils sont dans la chambre en ce moment.
Je veux le voir.
Il ira mieux.
Isabelle, pas maintenant.
Laisse-le avec le docteur pour le moment, ok ?
Désolé.
Voici ma fille, Isabelle.
Isabelle, voici Tom Baldwin.
Shawn m'a parlé de vous.
Salut.
Salut.
Vous me fixez des yeux.
Pourquoi donc ?
Comment va-t'il ?
Je lui ai donné un sédatif.
Il dort pour le moment.
Shawn a de graves hallucinations
auditives et persistantes.
Elles contribuent à son délire.
Son délire ?
Je ne comprends pas.
Que lui arrive-t'il ?
Les symptômes de Shawn sont...
... j'ai bien peur qu'ils ne traduisent les prémices
d'une schizophrénie désorganisée.
Mais vous allez le guérir, hein ?
Il va aller mieux ?
Eh bien, je n'ai jamais un tel cas.
Typiquement, la schizophrénie apparaît
par étape.
Les patients sombrent lentement,
leurs symptômes empirant.
Mais pour Shawn, c'est comme si la maladie
avait été provoquée.
La semaine dernière, nous avons reçu
un appel de Daniel Armand.
Il a menacé d'abattre Shawn,
si nous refusions un compromis
avec le groupe Nova.
Et aujourd'hui, deux jours plus tard,
il tombe d'un coup dans la schizophrénie.
Vous penez que le groupe Nova
est derrière tout ça ?
Eh bien, nous mènerons une enquête,
mais tant que la lumière n'est pas faite,
Shawn ne peut être laissé en liberté.
Ok, il est sûrement une victime
là-dedans,
mais son état mental est mal en point.
Il ne peut contrôler sa capacité.
Shawn est l'un des dirigeants de cet endroit.
Les gens l'adorent.
S'il disparaît dans une cave du NTAC,
il va y avoir beaucoup de tristesse par ici.
Personne ne parle de faire
disparaître quelqu'un.
Vous devez prendre un peu de recul par
rapport à tout ça.
Ici, nous avons un 4400 instable potentiellement
doué d'une capacité mortelle.
Une capacité qu'il a utilisé contre ma fille.
Si vous ne l'emmenez pas de vous-même
dans un hôpital psychiatrique,
je porterai plainte pour aggression.
Et ainsi vous retirez le poids de la décision.
Non !
Vous ne pouvez pas l'enfermer.
Ce n'est pas de sa faute.
Isabelle, Shawn a des ennuis.
Il a besoin de notre aide.
Je sais,
et au lieu de ça, tu veux l'abandonner ?
Il s'est sacrifié pour cet endroit.
Il t'avais dit de ne pas parler au groupe Nova,
même si cela signifiait qu'ils en aient après lui.
Maintenant, c'est le cas et tu veux le lâcher.
Nous ne le lâchons pas, nous le protégeons.
Oh, en le faisant enfermer ?
Isabelle...
Ce n'est pas vrai,
et nous ne discuterons pas de cela ici.
Ce n'est pas le moment.
Si vous acceptez que Shawn n'aille pas
à proximité d'un bâtiment gouvernemental,
nous l'emmèront dans un hôpital privé
jusqu'à ce que tout soit élucidé.
T'ont-ils mis au courant au sujet
de ce que je fais ici à l'école ?
Euh, pas grand chose.
Vous êtes une sorte de conseillère
d'orientation, c'est ça ?
En quelque sorte.
Je dirais plutôt une sorte de thérapiste.
Je travaille avec les élèves
en utilisant ma capacité.
Tous les enfants ici sont des 4400,
ce qui signifie que tu as raté des années de
vie de famille.
Tes parents ont eu un autre enfant, alors que
tu étais parti. Ton frêre, Curtis ?
Oui, avant qu'ils divorcent.
Je le connais à peine.
C'est là que j'interviens.
C'est difficile à expliquer,
mais si tu me laisses faire,
je peux te ramener dans les années
où tu étais parti.
Tu peux rencontrer ton frêre alors
qu'il n'était qu'un bébé,
le voir grandir,
et passer tout le temps que tu désires à ses côtés,
et contruire la relation qui vous manque.
Euh... je suis désolé.
Vous voulez me renvoyer dans le passé ?
Non.
Nous allons dans un monde créé avec
nos pensées,
et tout aura l'air aussi vrai que nature.
Ecoute, euh...
Ne le prend pas mal...
Mais peut-être que vous devriez penser
à vous aider vous-même.
Tu penses que j'ai besoin d'aide ?
Vous avez cette...
tristesse en vous.
Pas de tristesse, exactement.
Je crois que "rage" conviendrait mieux.
C'est à cause de ce qui est arrivé à votre mari
et votre fils il y a des années de cela.
Tu es au courant pour Billy et Paul ?
Ils ont été tués lors d'un accident.
La police n'a jamais retrouvé le gars.
Vous essayez d'oublier, et, euh...
je pense que vous y êtes quasiment parvenue,
mais vous y pensez encore chaque jour.
Et...
et il y a toujours cette rage.
Co-Comment sais-tu tout ça ?
Vous avez une capacité...
et j'ai une capacité.
Ecoutez, euh...
Je suis désolé...
Je ne suis pas très bon pour ça.
Donc, euh...
je peux retourner en classe ?
Vous avez raison d'être en colère, vous savez.
Le gars ?
Le conducteur ?
Il est... toujours dehors.
Ce n'est pas juste.
Mais tu as vraiment vu Shawn Farrell mardi ?
Un prêt immobilier de la part du centre.
Et comment s'est terminé la réunion ?
Oh, bien. Félicitations.
C'est un très joli quartier.
Non, non, M. Donovan. Merci pour votre temps.
Nous vous contacterons si besoin.
Tu sais, ton neveu est l'un
des dirigeants du centre.
Ils voient des dizaines de 4400 chaque jour,
et ceux avec qui nous avons parlé dont
les capacités sont enregistrées chez nous,
ils font des choses mineures.
Rien approchant de la capacité
à provoquer la folie,
et ceci en supposant que celui qui peut le faire
devait être à proximité de Shawn pour agir.
"Celui" ?
Nous savons quasiment qui a fait ça.
C'était Daniel Armand.
Du moins, s'il ne l'a pas fait, il en a donné l'ordre.
Non, la vérité est
nous ne savons pas vraiment si l'état
de Shawn est dû à une attaque.
Nova ne revendique rien,
et Shawn a l'âge parfait pour
un début de schizophrénie.
Donc, il est possible qu'en cherchant un crime,
la seule chose que nous trouvions
soit une tragédie.
Alors il n'y a rien que nous
puissions faire...
Et je ne peux pas l'accepter.
Nova a menacé Shawn.
Shawn est tombé malade.
Pour le moment, ces causes et effets
me suffisent.
Vous êtes Zachary ?
Oui, merci de me recontrer ici.
Pas de problème.
Matthew a dit que vous vouliez discuter
de quelque chose ?
Il y a environ 6 semaines,
une de mes amis de la quarantaine,
elle m'a proposé de dîner avec elle un soir.
Alors j'ai accepté, et...
elle m'a posé toutes sortes de questions.
Maintenant, elle ne me l'a jamais dit ouvertement
mais je vous jure qu'elle me testait pour voir
si je voulais rejoindre le groupe Nova.
Elle te recrutait ?
Cela ne m'étonnerait pas qu'elle en fasse partie.
Elle n'arrêtait pas de critiquer
contre le gouvernement.
Elle a dû en avoir marre à la fin--
Zachary...
si tu as un nom, donne le moi.
Jane Nance.
Merci d'être venu me voir.
Salut.
Todd...
Mme Mareva.
Qu'y-a-t'il ?
Ces choses que tu as dites à mon sujet.
Elles sont très privées.
Comment étais-tu au courant ?
Des fois, quand je parle avec des gens,
s'ils ressentent quelque chose
de vraiment fort,
Euh... je le ressens aussi,
et alors je sais pourquoi ils le ressentent.
Je le vois.
Donc, euh...
tu as vu ce qui est arrivé à ma famille ?
Pas tout.
Seulement des sortes de fragments.
Euh, j'ai vu la collision des
deux voitures.
J'ai vu le gars.
Il y avait des cannettes de bière vides
sur le siège avant.
Il voulait sortir de là,
appeler la police.
Je crois qu'il a changé d'avis.
L'homme qui leur est rentré dedans...
tu sais qui c'est ?
Ouais.
Je l'ai déjà écrit ici.
J'avais deviné que vous alliez le vouloir.
Keane Driscoll...
La sécurité m'ont dit que tu étais en haut.
Qu'est-ce que tu fabriques ?
Je prends les affaires de Shawn.
Je vais le sortir de l'hôpital.
Isabelle, je me dois de t'empêcher
de réagir avec excès.
Je sais que tu es inquiète au sujet de Shawn,
mais tout ce qu'on a est un indice.
Il se peut que l'on connaisse le nom
d'une personne du groupe Nova.
Et que va faire mon père ?
laisse-moi deviner...
Appeler le NTAC ?
Que feront-ils pour Shawn que je ne puisse
faire moi-même ?
Ils ont l'habitude de traiter avec
des 4400.
Pas autant que moi.
Non.
Matthew, laisse-moi passer.
Que vas-tu faire ?
Nous ne savons même pas si cet indice est bon,
si cette femme, Jane Nance, fait bien
partie du groupe Nova,
il n'y aucune garantie qu'elle soit responsable
de ce qui arrive à Shawn.
Si ce n'est pas elle, elle me permettra
de me rapprocher du vrai responsable.
Elle a été recrutée par Nova, non ?
Donc elle me donnera au moins un nom.
Je trouverai cette personne.
Si ce n'est pas le bon,
il me donnera un nom à son tour,
and à la fin, je tomberai sur la personne
qui fait du mal à Shawn,
et je l'arrêterai.
Attends.
Eh, attends.
Tu te rappelles la première que je suis
venu te voir ?
Tu étais si triste.
Tu ne savais pas où tu étais,
pourquoi tu avais grandi si vite,
pourquoi tu rendais ta mère si malade,
et je t'ai dit que tu faisais partie des chanceux.
Tu as un objectif, un travail à faire.
Je t'ai même dit de quoi il s'agit.
Tu te souviens ?
Dis-le.
Je dois éliminer les 4400.
Exactement.
Personne dans le futur pense qu'ils
sont une bonne chose.
Personne ne pense qu'il vont
sauver le monde.
Tous ces discours sur une catastrophe
que doivent empêcher les 4400 ?
Ce sont des mensonges.
Ils sont la catastrophe. Tous.
Ton père, Shawn, et s'il a des ennuis...
c'est bon pour nous.
C'est ce que tu n'arrêtes pas de me dire.
Au revoir.
Non ! Je ne peux pas te laisser faire ça.
Tu n'es pas prête à te débrouiller seule.
Tu as besoin de moi.
Tu as besoin de mes conseils.
Je ne crois pas, Matthew.
C'est la remise des diplômes aujourd'hui.
Hôpital Psychiatrique d'Abendson
Shawn ?
Isabelle.
Nous devons partir, ok ?
Isabelle...
Isabelle...
Mes molaires sortent, et...
elles descendent dans le fond de ma gorge.
Je les sens.
Tout va bien.
Je vais te sortir de là.
Viens avec moi, ok ?
Ok ?
Elle s'apppelle Jane nance,
et elle habite à 20 minutes d'ici.
Nous pensons que c'est un bon indice.
Si elle est vraiment membre du groupe Nova,
vous pouvez être sûrs
qu'elle est prête à se defendre.
Alors soyez prudents.
Te voilà, Triton.
Te voilà.
Oui, tu es un garçon très patient.
Fidget...
Qu'est-ce que je t'ai déjà dit au sujet
de s'asseoir sur la télévision ?
Pas encore, Herkie.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Nous savons tous ce que signifie
toucher le fond.
Ne ne serions pas là sinon.
Chacun y arrive à sa façon, ce...
ce moment où nous réalisons que nous ne
contrôlons plus notre désir de boire.
Je--
Désolée de vous avoir interrompu.
Pas de problème.
Venez par là.
Prenez un siège.
Je disais donc...
Je m'appelle Keane et je suis un alcoolique.
Bonjour, Keane.
Jane Nance !
Oh, mon Dieu.
Quoi ?
Eloignez ces animaux d'elle.
Que s'est-il passé ici ?
C'est comme si tous ses animaux
s'étaient retournés contre elle.
Peut-être que quelqu'un...
a provoquer cela.
Il est mort très rapidement.
Ca a très pu être une énorme attaque,
peut-être une crise cardiaque.
Je vais appeler une ambulance,
et le légiste.
M. Tyler, les deux agents du NTAC
sont à nouveau ici.
Ils disent vouloir vous voir.
Ecoutez, M. Tyler, Isabelle a fait échapper
Shawn de l'hôpital.
Ceci est un fait avéré,
et maintenant, nous apprenons que
Matthew Ross,
un homme de 36 ans,
vient de mourrir d'une attaque sur le sol
du salon de Shawn Farrell.
Il y a moins d'une heure, Jane Nance
est décédée elle aussi.
Et vous nous dites que
vous ne voyez aucune connexion ?
Je vous dit que nous parlons ici de ma fille.
Il se peut qu'elle ait emmené Shawn,
je veux bien l'admettre.
Elle est parfois immature, oui,
mais ce n'est pas une tueuse.
Vous n'avez aucune idée de l'endroit
où elle a bien pu emmener Shawn ?
Non, mais si elle appelle, je vais essayer
de la convaincre de revenir,
et je vous préviens aussitôt.
C'est le mieux que je puisse faire.
Est-ce tout ?
Au revoir. Merci.
C'est normal d'être timide.
Je me rappelle ma première réunion.
Je n'avais pas prononcé un mot non plus.
J'étais... au fond du fond.
Géné ne serait-ce que de respirer.
Il y a combien de temps de cela ?
Environ 9 ans.
Je, euh...
J'ai eu un accident de voiture.
Ma vérité est que j'arrive à peine
à m'en souvenir.
Je suis venu...
et j'ai su...
Je devais changer ma vie.
Alors je l'ai fait.
Je dirige ces réunions depuis 5 ans maintenant.
Et vous ? Vous avez traversé
une telle épreuve ?
Diana, nous avons mis sur écoute
le portable de Shawn.
Celui de Richard Tyler, aussi.
Si Isabelle appelle, on pourra l'entendre.
Est-ce que cette fille te fais peur
autant qu'à moi ?
Je veux dire, si on oublie ce qu'elle a fait
ou pas fait aujourd'hui.
Tu l'as rencontrée...
Je veux dire...
Elle ressemble à une fille normale.
Attirante, peut-être un peu naïve,
mais lorsqu'elle dit quelque chose...
tu réalises qu'elle te regarde comme si
tu étais une simple fourmi,
et qu'elle était en train de décider si elle
allait t'arracher tes pattes ou non.
Chaque 4400 a un passé avant d'avoir été enlevé.
Pas elle.
Elle est juste...
sortie de terre en quelques sortes.
Elle n'est même pas une 4400.
Elle est autre chose.
Une nouvelle catégorie.
On a quelque chose sur la radio centrale.
On a vu la voiture de Shawn se dirigeant
vers l'est sur Forbes Avenue.
C'est à Everett. Allons-y.
Euh, Diana. Je dois passer chez moi avant.
J'en prendrai pas.
J'en prendrai pas.
Il y a des antennes radio dedans,
et... et...
c'est comme ça qu'ils entendent
ce à quoi je pense.
J'en prendrai pas.
Shawn, il n'y aucune antenne radio.
Ce sont juste des pillules.
Elles vont t'aider à aller mieux.
La notice dit que tu dois en prendre
toutes les 4 heures.
Shawn, arrête ça !
Attends une minute.
Le voilà.
Il est si tard.
Tu m'as fait peur.
Désolé.
Quelqu'un a eu un indice
sur la voiture de Shawn.
Elle était abandonnée, en fait.
On le cherche toujours.
Tout va bien ?
Oui.
Je ne sais pas.
Non.
Un garçon à l'école, il a ce don.
Il voit des choses,
des choses qui sont déjà arrivées.
Il dit qu'il a vu... l'accident qui a tué Billy.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Chérie...
Comment dirait-il une chose pareille ?
Parce que...
il m'a aussi donné le nom de l'homme
qui a fait ça.
Je suis allé le voir, Thomas.
Tu as fait quoi ?
Il dirigeait une réunion A.A.
Il m'a dit qu'il avait eu un accident de voiture
alors qu'il était îvre il y a 9 ans.
Alana, chérie, s'il s'agit vraiment de l'homme,
Nous allons nous en occuper.
- En vous basant sur quoi ?
Les visions d'un 4400 qui n'était qu'un enfant
quand l'accident s'est produit ?
Alana, je t'en prie, ne va plus voir cet homme.
Ca pourrait être dangeureux.
Tu devrais décrocher, Thomas.
Oui, mais...
tu es sure que tu vas bien ?
Je vais bien.
Mieux que ton neveu en tout cas.
Baldwin.
L'endroit appartient à un 4400 nommé
Jorge Molina.
Les pompiers ont trouvé des restes
carbonisés à l'intérieur.
Ils pensent que c'est lui.
Qu'est-ce qui a provoqué l'incenfie ?
Ils ne sont pas sûrs.
Apparemment, Molina avait l'habitude de laisser
traîner des bidons d'essence dans le garage.
Des voisins disent que c'était quelqu'un
en bonne santé et à cheval sur la sécurité.
Ils disent que c'est un départ de feu
dû au hasard.
Je pense qu'ils ont raison, hein ?
Oui, soit ça, ou alors Isabelle a trouvé
le nom d'un autre membre du groupe Nova.
Allo ?
Tout est bientôt fini, papa.
Allo ?
j'ai découvert qui est le responsable
pour Shawn.
C'est Daniel Armand.
Isabelle ?
Le dernier Nova à qui j'ai parlé me l'a dit.
Isabelle, où es-tu ?
j'attends juste qu'il rentre chez lui,
et ensuite je vais l'empêcher de nuire.
Isabelle, si tu sais où habite Armand,
nous le dirons au NTAC.
Ils s'en occuperont.
Je n'arrêterai pas.
Papa...
Quand tout sera fini,
je pourrai rentrer à la maison ?
Ils me laisseront faire, ou...
ai-je trop de problèmes ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est possible.
Si tu arrêtes maintenant, peut-être.
Dis-moi seulement où tu es
que je te rejoigne.
Ok.
Diana, on vient d'intercepter un appel
sur le téléphone de Richard.
C'était Isabelle.
- Où est-elle ?
Elle s'est arrêtée à une adresse
de Munhall.
Elle dit que c'est là qu'est
Daniel Armand.
Tu ferais mieux de ne pas lui faire de mal.
Je ne lui fais pas mal.
C'est presque fini.
Isabelle...
Shawn ?
Tu vas bien ?
Oui, je crois.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Je ne me rappelle rien.
Que fait Armand ici ?
C'est lui qui te faisait du mal.
Il t'a rendu fou.
C'est sa capacité.
Mais je l'ai arrêté.
Il est tout à toi maintenant.
Tu peux faire ce que tu veux.
Maitenant, elle veut me tuer;
Je ne tue personne, Isabelle.
Si tu ne le fais pas, elle le fera.
Est-ce vrai ?
J'ai fait ce qu'il fallait pour que
tu ailles mieux,
et qu'est-ce que cela peut bien faire ?
Tu n'es plus malade.
Je sais. Je sais.
Merci, mais c'est terminé.
C'est terminé.
Je vais mieux.
Nous avons Armand.
Partons. Nous pouvons nous enfuir.
Tu ne connais pas vraiment cette fille,
n'est-ce pas ?
Tu penses qu'elle est des nôtres ?
Ne l'écoute pas Isabelle.
Arrête de parler.
- Elle n'est pas des nôtres, Shawn.
Elle a tué plein de gens pour me trouver,
et elle ne peut pas s'enfuir.
Je t'ai dit d'arrêter de parler maintenant.
Ne fais pas ça, Isabelle.
Ne fais pas ça !
Pour ta gouverne, Daniel, je n'ai pas tué
tes amis, pas exactement.
Je n'ai fait que de retourner leur capacité contre eux.
Et tu fais quoi toi déjà ?
Ah, oui.
Tu rends les gens fous.
Non...
Isabelle...
Isabelle, arrête ça !
Arrête ça !
Ils veulent m'enlever tous mes organes.
Tous.
Ils en ont enlevé la moitié.
Ils en ont enlevé la moitié...
Pourquoi lui as-tu fait ça ?
Il était toujours une menace pour toi, Shawn.
Si nous étions parti,
qui lui aurait empêcher de t'attaquer
à nouveau ?
Tout ce que j'ai fait, je l'ai fait pour
que tu guérisses.
Et je ne regrette rien du tout.
Si je avais dû tuer une centaine de personnes,
je l'aurais fait.
Qui es-tu ?
Si quiconque dénote une résistance de la part
de la fille ou de Daniel Armand,
n'hésitez pas à utiliser vos armes.
Tom ?
Rien à ajouter ?
- Non, allons-y.
Stop !
On ne peut pas faire ça, M. Tyler.
Nous devons en finir.
Ecoutez, si vous entrez la-dedans
avec toutes vos armes,
cela peut finir très mal pour tout le monde.
Laissez-moi parler à Isabelle.
Voir si je peux la raisonner.
Vous encerclez la zone, non ?
Si je ne suis pas revenu dans 5 minutes,
vous pouvez entrer.
Isabelle ?
Shawn ?
Richard.
Tu dois lui parler.
Tu dois lui parler.
Elle veut les affronter.
Elle va tuer tout le monde.
Papa !
Nous pouvons nous débarrasser d'eux.
Aide-moi.
On peut leur retirer les armes des mains, vrai ?
Non, Isabelle. Nous ne sommes pas ici
pour combattre le gouvernement.
Pas aujourd'hui.
Je n'ai pas le choix.
Si tu l'as.
Sors d'ici avec moi.
Tu vas avoir quelques problèmes pour avoir
fait échapper Shawn de l'hôpital.
Mais on peut arranger ça.
Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé avec Matthew
et les autres,
mais on peut arranger ça aussi,
mais si tu affrontes ces agents, c'est fini.
Tu deviens ennemie de l'état.
Ils t'attraperont un jour.
Ils t'enfermeront à vie.
Je me fiche qu'ils soient forts,
et rien ne pourra m'en empécher.
Tout ça...
je l'ai fait pour sauver Shawn,
et maintenant, il me hait.
Isabelle...
Isabelle...
Je ne te hais pas.
Il a juste peur, c'est tout. Comme nous tous.
Allons-y.
Ils sortent.
Shawn !
Tout va bien ?
- Oui. Oui.
Daniel Armand est à l'intérieur.
Il est à vous.
Donc voilà ce qu'on ressent lorsqu'on regarde
quelqu'un se tirer d'affaires de meurtres.
S'il n'y a aucune évidence ou flagrant délit.
Comment peut-il y avoir de meurtrier ?
Comme pour les morts, Shawn ne souvient de rien.
Il n'y a aucun témoin, dont officiellement,
nous n'avons aucun dossier.
Oui, mais...
elle l'a fait,
et j'ai peur qu'une fois tout cela terminé,
elle en fasse encore plus.
Leurs noms étaient Billy et Paul.
Paul était mon mari.
Billy était mon fils.
Ils ont été tués dans un
accident de voiture en 1997.
La même année où vous avez touché le fond.
Qu'est-ce que cela a-t'il à voir avec moi ?
- Tout.
Vous les avez tués.
Ecoutez, je vous l'ai déjà dit.
Il y a 9 ans...
J'étais un autre homme.
Quelque chose est arrivé.
Quelque chose...
de terrible.
et j'ai eu le choix.
soit je mettais un terme à ma vie
soit j'essayais d'en vivre une meilleure,
et j'ai décidé de vivre,
et j'ai eu une meilleure vie.
Je m'y suis dévoué.
Regardez autour de vous !
J'aide les gens.
Oui et vous croyez probablement
que cela suffit.
Essayez de vivre des jours,
des semaines entières même,
sans penser à l'autre homme et ce qu'il a fait.
J'y pense chaque jour.
Ca me hante...
et je vais m'assurer que cela vous hante toute votre vie.
Je ne vous laisserai pas les oublier.
Je vais bien, Papa.
Ils m'ont bien traité.
j'ai juste besoin...
d'un peu de temps seule, ok ?
Isabelle ?
tu sais, un de ces jours,
il faudra que nous parlions
de Matthew et du reste.
Comment êtes-vous entré ici ?
Fermez la porte.
On a à parler.
A propos de quoi ?
Certaines personnes veulent ta mort.
J'espérais que tu puisses m'expliquer
pourquoi.
Qui vous a donné ça ?
C'est une longue histoire.
Disons juste que la femme qui me l'a laissé
vous considère comme le Mal.
Elle dit que si l'humanité veut survivre,
vous devez mourir.
Quoi, vous trouvez ça drôle ?
Non.
C'est juste que beaucoup de monde ont
des opinions sur moi.
D'un côté je suis... le Sauveur.
De l'autre, la fin du Monde.
C'est sympa d'avoir le choix, je pense.
Cet homme, Matthew ?
Celui qui a eu une attaque ?
Il est venu me voir juste après que je grandis.
Il disait que j'étais supposée
faire des choses.
Détruire les 4400.
Tous les tuer.
Il m'a dit que c'était le seul moyen
de sauver le monde.
Je lui ai dit non.
Il se peut que j'ai été conçue dans le futur,
mais je ne suis pas leur marionnette.
Il n'a pas apprécié ma réponse.
Il ne nous embêtera plus.
Idem pour ces membres du groupe Nova.
Ces gens étaient des terroristes.
C'étaient des assassins.
Ils faisaient du mal à Shawn.
Ecoutez...
Peu importe qui vous a raconté
que j'étais mauvaise,
que je suis une sorte d'armageddon.
C'est faux.
J'ai tourné le dos à tout ça.
Je ne suis pas un assassin
et vous savez quoi ?
Je me fiche du fait que je vous fasse peur,
car je pense que vous n'en êtes pas un non plus.
Vous ne me connaissez pas.
Non ?
Découvrons le tout de suite.
Voilà.
L'ange de la mortt,
la fin de la race humaine,
ou peu importe comment ils m'appellent.
Je ne bougerai pas.
Je vous promets.
Non.
Pas encore.
Pas avant que je sois sûr.
Et vous n'êtes pas un assassin.
C'est pas grave.
Vous devriez prendre ceci avec vous
au cas où vous changeriez d'avis.
Espérez que je n'en change pas.
Un homme dans un état critique
aprés un accident de voiture.
C'est moi qui ai fait ça ?
Non Todd.
C'est moi.
Ce n'est pas ce que je voulais.
Je ne voulais pas...
Mais je l'ai fait.
Bienvenue à Haspel Copr.
En quoi puis-je vous renseigner ?
Salut.
j'ai un rendez-vous avec Dennis Ryland.
Je m'appelle Isabelle Tyler.
Miss Tyler.
M. Ryland vous attend.
Au 24ème étage. Il vous attend.

over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted
all at once they were returned
with no memory of
where they've been
they haven't aged a day
and some have returned
with new abilities
all are trying to reconnect...
...with a life interrupted
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
my name is daniel armand.
You know who I am?
Of the nova group?
I called to arrange a truce
and to talk about shawn farrell.
We need to discuss his future,
because unless you and i can come to some kind of an agreement,
I'm not sure he's going to have one.
Believe me,I know which bench i dedicated to my husband and son.
They died in a car accident shortly before I was abducted.
Our enemies are more resourceful than we imagined,
and they've let loose a terrible evil into your time.
This evil,there has to be some other way to deal with it.
There is. You.
(kill isabelle)
You are the other way.
Oh,tom.Good. You're here.
Yeah,just like always.
Well,come on,we need to get started.
Started with what?
Diana,I have no idea what you're talking about.
Sure you do.Come on,let's go.
She's waiting.
What is this?
I brought her in.You can just do it,and we can get on with our day.
"It"?
No...
no way,I'm not...
tom,you're supposed to do this.They told you so.
I know. It's just...
they didn't say why.
I don't think I can.Maybe I'm bad.
Maybe I'll kill a bunch of people.
You can stop it.
I could be responsible for millions of deaths,
unless you do something.
We've got a lot to do today.
It's all right,tom.I don't mind.
Come on.
Take the needle.
Come on,tom.
Do it.
Do it.
I'm sorry.
I can't find it...
I can't find the bug...
I can't find it...
I know you're listening.
I know you put it somewhere inside of me.
I'm going to find it.
I can't find it.
I can't find the bug.
I can't find it.
I can't find the bug.
Inside me somewhere.
I know you're listening.
I'm going to find it.
I'm going to get an x-ray of my whole body...
maia's it!
Maia's it!
I'm going to get you,amy!
No,you won't!
Yes,I will!
maia...
maia,are you all right?
It hurts.
I can help you.
It's just a bump,shawn.
I can make it better.
It hurts...
you're getting better.
Hey! Let her go!
You're hurting her!
Somebody help!
Let go!
Help!
what's going on?
He's killing her!
Get him away!
Mr. Farrell,let go.
Stay away from her!
I don't understand.I was healing her.
I was making her better.

Sweetheart...
hey,mom.
How are you doing?
I'm okay.
Maia's vital signs are fine.
There's no lasting damage that I can detect.
At the moment,she's mostly just dehydrated.
Sweetheart...
mommy?
What is it?
Why...would shawn hurt me?
Oh,my god...
shawn did this?
He missed some meetings yesterday,but I had no idea it had gotten this bad.
How's shawn? Is he okay?
We don't know.
We called a psychiatrist for him.They're back in the bedroom now.
Well,I want to see him.He'll feel better.
Isabelle,not right now.
Let him be with the doctor for a while,okay?
Sorry.
This is my daughter,isabelle.
Isabelle,this is tom baldwin.
Shawn told me about you.
Hi.
Hi.
You're staring at me.
Why?
How is he?
I gave him a sedative.He's sleeping right now.
Shawn is experiencing persistent and powerful auditory hallucinations.
They're contributing to his delusions.
Delusions?
I don't understand.What's happening to him?
Shawn's symptoms are...
well,I'm afraid they're consistent with the onset of disorganized schizophrenia.
But you're going to fix him,right?You're going to make him better.
Well,I've never seen a case quite like this.
Typically,schizophrenia has a gradual onset.
Patients slowly withdraw from the world as their symptoms get worse,
but with shawn,it's almost as if the disease was just turned on.
Last week,we got a phone call from daniel armand.
He said if we weren't willing to reach a compromise with nova,
he'd come gunning for shawn,
and now it's two days later,
and he just happens to come down with schizophrenia?
You think the nova group did this to shawn?
Well,we'll investigate it,
but until the matter is cleared up,
shawn just can't walk around free.
I mean,okay,he's probably a victim in this,
but his mental state has been compromised.
He can't control his ability.
Shawn is one of the leaders of this place.
People love him.
If he just disappears into the basement at ntac,
there's going to be a lot of unhappiness around here.
Nobody's talking about disappearing anyone.
You need to just distance yourself from the situation just for a second.
Now,we have an insane 4400 with a potentially lethal ability.
This is an ability that has turned against my daughter.
If you don't voluntarily remand him to a psychiatric hospital,
then I'll file a complaint for assault.
And take the decision out of your hands.
No!
You can't lock him up.This isn't his fault.
Isabelle,shawn is in trouble.He needs help.
I know he does,
and instead,you just want to abandon him?
He sacrificed for this place.
He told you not to talk to nova,
even if it meant they were going to come after him.
Now they did,and you just want to cut himoose?
We're not cutting him loose,we are protecting him.
Oh,by locking him up?
Isabelle...
that is not true,
and we are not having this discussion now.
This is not the place.
If you'll agree that shawn goes nowhere near a government facility,
we'll commit him to a private hospital until all this is cleared up.
How much did they tell you about what I do here at the school?
Um,not much.
You're some sort of guidance counselor,right?
I'm something like that.
It's more like a therapist,I guess you could say.
I work with the students here using my ability.
All the kids here are 4400s,
which means you missed years of your families' lives.
Your parents had another child while you were gone,your brother curtis?
Yeah,before they got divorced.
I barely know him.
That's where I come in.
It's hard to explain,
but if you let me,
I can take you back to the years when you were gone.
You can meet your brother when he was a baby,
see him grow up,
and spend all the time you need with him,
and build the relationship you don't have.
Um... I'm sorry.
What,you want to take me back in time?
No.
We go into a world we create using both our minds,
and it will seem just as real as this one.
Look,uh...
no offense...
but maybe you should worry about helping yourself.
You think I need help?
You have this...
sadness inside you.
Not sadness,exactly.
I guess "rage" would be the best word.
It's because of what happened to your husband and son all those years ago.
You know about billy and paul?
They got killed in a hit-and-run.
The police never caught the guy.
You try to move on,and,uh...
I guess you kind of have,
but you still think about it every day.
And...
and there's still that rage.
How...how do you know all that?
Well,you have an ability...
and I have an ability.
Look,uh...
I'm sorry...
I'm just not up for this.
So,uh...
is it okay if I go back to class?
You're right to be mad,you know.
The guy?
The driver?
He'S...kind of out there.
It's not fair.
But you did see shawn farrell on tuesday?
A home loan from the center.
And how did the meeting end?
Oh,well,congratulations.
That's a really nice neighborhood.
No,no,mr. Donovan,thanks for your time.
We'll be in touch if we need anything further.
You know,your nephew is one of the leaders of the center.
He sees dozens of 4400s every day,
and the ones we've spoken to who have registered abilities with us,
they have minor stuff.
Nothing like the capacity to induce insanity,
and that's assuming that whoever did this
had to be in proximity to shawn to make it happen.
"Whoever"?
We basically know who did this.It was daniel armand.
Either he did it,or he gave the order.
Well,no,the truth is,
we don't actually know that shawn's condition is the result of an attack.
Nova's not claiming credit,
and shawn's exactly the right age for onset of schizophrenia.
So it's possible that we're looking for a crime,
and the only thing we'll find is a tragedy.
Then there's nothing we can do...
and I cannot accept that.
Nova threatened shawn,shawn got sick.
For right now,that's all the cause and effect i need.
You're zachary?
Yeah,thanks for meeting me out here.
It's all right.
Matthew said you had something you wanted to discuss?
About six weeks ago,
a friend of mine from quarantine,
she asked me to meet her for dinner.
So I go,and...
and she's asking me all sorts of questions.
Now,she never came right out and said it,
but I swear she was feeling me out to see if I would join the nova group.
She was recruiting you?
I wouldn't be surprised if she was a member.
I mean,she used to bitch about the government all the time.
I guess she just finally got fed up--
zachary...
if you got a name,give it to me.
Jane nance.
Thank you for coming forward.
Hi.
Todd...
ms. Mareva.
What's up?
Those things you said about me.
They're very private.
How did you know?
Sometimes,when I'm talking to somebody,
if they feel something real strong,
um,I feel it,too,
and then I know why they feel that way.
I see it.
So,uh...
you saw what happened to my family?
Not the whole thing.
I just get,like,fragments.
Um,I saw the two cars hit.
I saw this guy.
There were empty beer bottles by his seat.
He thought about getting out,
calling the cops.
I guess he changed his mind.
The man who hit them...
you know who he is?
Yeah.
I already wrote it down.
I figured you'd want it.
Keane driscoll...
security told me you were up here.
What are you doing?
I'm packing shawn's stuff.
I'm taking him out of that hospital.
Isabelle,I have to caution you against overreaction.
I know you're worried about shawn,
but all we have is a tip.
We might know the name of one person in the nova group.
What's my dad going to do with that?
Let me guess,call ntac?
What'll they do for shawn that I can't?
They're equipped to deal with 4400s.
Not as well as I am.
No.
Matthew,get out of my way.
What are you going to do?
We don't even know if that tip is any good,
and if this woman,jane nance,is in the nova group,
there's no guarantee that she's the one that's doing this to shawn.
Well,if she's not,she'll get me closer to the person who is.
She was recruited into nova,right?
So she'll know at least one name.
I'll find that person.
If they're not the one,they'll know a name,too,
and eventually,I'll find the person who's hurting shawn,
and I'll make him stop.
Wait.
Hey,wait.
Do you remember the first time i came to see you?
You were so sad.
You didn't know who you were,
why you grew up so fast,
why you were making your mother so sick,
and I told you,you were one of the lucky ones.
You have a purpose,a job to do.
I even told you what it was.
Do you remember?
Say it.
I'm supposed to eliminate the 4400.
That's right.
Not everyone from the future thinks they're a good thing.
Not everyone thinks they're going to save the world.
All this talk of a catastrophe the 4400
are supposed to prevent?
It's lies.
They are the catastrophe.All of them.
Your father,shawn,and if he's in trouble...
that's good for us.
So you keep telling me.
Goodbye.
No!I can't allow you to do this!
You're not ready to be on your own.You need me.
You need my guidance.
I don't think I do,matthew.
Today's graduation day.
abendson psychiatric
care facility
shawn?
Isabelle.
We have to go now,okay?
Isabelle...
isabelle...
my back teeth are melting,and...
They're going to run down my throat.
I can feel it.
it's okay.
I'm going to make you better.
Just come with me,okay?
Okay?
Her name is jane nance,
and she lives about 20 minutes away.
We think the tip is good.
If she really is a member of nova,
you can bet she'll be ready to defend herself,
so let's be careful.
Here you go,triton.
Here you go.
Yeah,you've been a very patient boy.
Fidget...
what did I tell you about sitting on the tv?
Not yet,herkie.
Who are you?
We all know what it's like to hit bottom.
We wouldn't be here if we didn'T.
It comes in a different way for each of us,that...
that moment when we realize our drinking is out of control.
I--
sorry to interrupt.
It's okay.
It's okay. Come on in.
Grab a seat.
I was just saying...
my name is keane,and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi,keane.
Jane nance!
Oh,my god.
What?
Get those animals away from her.
What the hell happened here?
It's like all these pets she keeps,they turned on her.
Maybe someone...
turned them on her.
He died very quickly.
It could have been a massive stroke,
maybe a coronary.
I'll call an ambulance,
and the coroner.
Mr. Tyler,those two ntac agents are here again.
They say they need to see you.
Look,mr. Tyler,isabelle broke shawn out of the hospital.
We know that for a fact,
and now we learn that matthew ross,
a 36-year-old man,
just happened to die of a stroke on the floor of shawn farrell's living room.
Within the hour,jane nance dies as well.
I mean,are you telling us that you don't see a connection?
I'm telling you you're talking about my daughter.
She shouldn't have taken shawn,I'll admit that.
She can be immature sometimes,yes,but she is not a killer.
Any idea where isabelle may have taken shawn?
No,but if she calls,I'll try to convince her to come in,
and I'll let you know.
That's the best I can do.
Is there anything else?
See you. Thanks.
it's okay to be shy.
I remember my first meeting.
I didn't say anything,either.
I was...at rock bottom.
Embarrassed just to be breathing.
How long ago was that?
About nine years.
I,uh...
I was in a car accident.
Truth is,I can barely even remember it.
I came to...
and I knew...
I had to change my life.
So I did.
I've been leading these meetings for five years now.
How about you?You have a moment like that?
Diana,we opened a trace on shawn's cell phone.
Richard tyler's,too.
If isabelle calls,we'll be listening.
Does this girl scare you as much as she scares me?
I mean,never mind what she did or didn't do today.
You just meet her...
I mean...
she looks like a normal kid.
Attractive,maybe a bit naive,but when she says something...
you realize she's looking at you like you're an ant,
and she's just deciding whether or not she's going to rip your legs off.
Every other 4400 had a past before they were taken,a history.
Not her.
She just...
kind of sprouted.
She's not even a 4400.
She's something else.A new category.
We got a hit on the apb.
Shawn's car was spotted headed east on forbes avenue.
That's in everett.Let's go.
Uh,diana,I need to make a stop at home first.
i'm not taking those.
I'm not taking those.
There's radio antennas inside of there,
and... and...
that's how they hear what I'm thinking.
I'm not taking those.
shawn,there are no radio antennas.
They're just pills.They make you feel better.
The label says you're supposed to take them every four hours.
Shawn,stop that!
Wait a minute.
There he is.
It's so late.
You scared me.
Sorry.
Someone called in a tip on shawn's car.
It was abandoned,though.
He's still missing.
everything okay?
Yeah.
I don't know.
No.
A boy at school,he has this gift.
He sees things,things that already happened.
He says he saw the...accident that killed billy.
Oh,my god.
Baby...
why would he tell you that?
Because...
he also gave me the name of the man who did it.
I went to see him,thomas.
You did what?
He was leading an A.A. Meeting.
He told me had a car accident while he was drunk nine years ago.
Alana,sweetie,if this really is the guy,
we'll look into it.
Based on what?
The visions of a 4400 who was a little kid when the accident happened?
Alana,please,don't go see this guy again.
It could be dangerous.
You should pick up,thomas.
Yeah,but...
are you sure you're okay?
I'm fine.
Better than your nephew,anyway.
Baldwin.
The place is owned by a 4400 named jorge molina.
The fire department found some burnt remains inside.
They think it's him.
What started the fire?
They're not sure.
Apparently,molina had a habit of leaving oily rags laying around the garage.
Someone in health and safety gave him a bunch of citations for it.
Said it was a fire hazard.
Guess they were right,huh?
Yeah,either that,or isabelle found the name of another member of the nova group.
Hello?
This will all be over soon,daddy.
Hello?
I found out who's doing this to shawn.
It's daniel armand.
Isabelle?
The last nova I talked to told me.
Isabelle,w-where are you?
I'm just waiting for him to come home,
and then i'm going to make him stop.
Isabelle,if you know where armand is,we'll tell ntac.
They'll take care of it.
I'm not stopping.
Daddy...
when all this is done,can I come home?
Will they let me,or...
am I in too much trouble?
I don't know.
Maybe.
If you stop now,maybe.
Just tell me where you're going so I can come meet you.
Okay.
Diana,we just intercepted a call to richard tyler's phone.
It was isabelle.
Where is she?
She's headed to an address in munhall.
She says daniel armand is there.
you'd better not be hurting him.
I'm not.
It's almost done.
Isabelle...
shawn?
Are you okay?
Yeah,I think so.
What happened?I don't remember anything.
What's armand doing here?
He was hurting you.
He broke your mind.
That's his ability.But I made him stop.
He's yours now.
You can do what you want.
Now she wants you to kill me.
I'm not killing anybody,isabelle.
If you don't,she will.
Is that true?
I did what I had to do to make you better,
and what does it matter anyway?
You're not sick anymore.
I know,I know.
Thank you,but it's over.
It's over.
I'm better.We have armand.
Let's just go.We can walk away.
You don't really know this girl at all,do you?
You think she's one of us?
Don't listen to him,isabelle.
Stop talking.
She's not,shawn.
She killed her way across town to find me,
and there's no way she's walking away.
I said,stop talking now.
Don't,isabelle.
Don't!
For the record,daniel,I didn't kill your people,not exactly.
All I did was turn their abilities against them.
And what do you do again?
Oh,right.
You make people crazy.
No...
isabelle...
isabelle,stop it!
Stop it!
They want to take my organs out.
All of them.
They're halfway done.
They're halfway done...
why did you do that to him?
He was still a threat to you,shawn.
If we just left,
what's to keep him from attacking you again?
Everything I did,I did to make you better.
I don't regret any of it.
If I had to kill a hundred people,I would have.
Who are you?
If anyone gets any resistance from the girl or daniel armand,
xxx
tom?
Anything to add?
No,let's move.
Stop!
Can't do that,mr. Tyler,we need to end this.
Look,if you go in there with your guns out,
this can end badly for everybody.
Let me talk to isabelle.
See if I can get her to come out quietly.
You guys got the place surrounded,right?
If I'm gone more than five minutes,
you can just come in anyway.
Isabelle?
Shawn?
Richard.
you've got to talk to her.
You've got to talk to her.
She wants to fight them.
She's going to get everyone killed.
Daddy!
We can get past them.
You can help me.
We can get the guns out of their hands,right?
No,isabelle.We're not here to fight the government.
Not today.
I don't have a choice.
Yes,you do.
Walk out there with me.
You're going to get in trouble for breaking shawn out of the hospital.
But we can deal with it.
I don't know what happened with matthew and the others,
but we can deal with that,too,
but if you go after those agents,that is it.
You are an enemy of the government.
They will catch you eventually.
They will put you away forever.
I don't care how strong you are,
and there won't be anything i can do about it.
All this...
I did it to save shawn,and he hates me now.
Isabelle...
isabelle...
I don't hate you.
He's just scared,that's all.We all are.
Let's go.
They're coming out!
Shawn!
Are you all right?
Yeah,yeah.
Daniel armand's inside.
He's all yours.
So this is what feels like to watch someone get away with murder.
If there's no evidence of foul play.
How can there be a murder?
As for the deaths,shawn doesn't remember anything.
There's no witnesses,so officially,we don't have a case.
Yeah,but...
she did it,
and I can't help but think when all this is over she's going to do a lot more.
Their names were billy and paul.
Paul was my husband.
Billy was our son.
They were killed in a hit-and-run accident in 1997.
The same year you hit bottom.
Everything.
You killed them.
Look,I told you before.
Nine years ago...
I was a different man.
Something happened.
Something...
terrible...
and I had a choice.
I could end my life,
or I could try to live it better,
and I decided to live,
and I did do better.
I dedicated myself to it.
I mean,look around!
I help people.
You do,and you probably feel like that's enough.
I bet you you go days,
whole weeks,even,
without ever thinking about that other man and what he did.
I think about it every day.
It never goes away for me...
and I'm going to make sure it never goes away for you,either.
I won't let you forget them.
I'm fine,daddy.
They treated me fine.
I just need...
a little time alone,okay?
Isabelle...
you know,sometime very soon,
we're going to have to talk about matthew,about all this.
How did you get in here?
shut the door.
We need to talk.
About what?
Some people want me to kill you.
I was hoping you could tell me why.
Who gave you that?
Long story.
Let's just say the woman who left it for me,she called you evil.
Said if humanity was going to survive,
you had to die.
What,you think that's funny?
No.
It's just,it seems like a lot of people have opinions about me.
Either I'M...the savior,
or I'm the end of the world.
It's nice to have options,I guess.
That man,matthew?
The one who had a stroke?
He came to me right after I grew up.
He said I was supposed to do all kinds of things.
Destroy the 4400.
Kill them all.
He told me it was the only way to save the world.
I told him no.
I might have been concei in the future,
but I'm not their puppet.
He didn't like that.
He's not around anymore.
Neither are those members of the nova group.
Those people wterrorists.
They were murderers!
They were hurting shawn!
Look...
whoever told you that I'm bad,
that I'm some sort of walking armageddon,is wrong.
I turned my back on all that.
I'm not a murderer,and you know what?
I don't care how much I scare you,I don't think you are,either.
You don't know me.
No?
Let's find out.
Here I am.
The angel of death,
the end of the human race,
or whatever the hell it is they call me.
I won't move.
I promise.
No.
Not yet.
Not until I'm sure.
And you're not a murderer.
It's okay.
You should take that with you in case you change your mind.
You better hope I don'T.
local man in critical condition
after one-car accident
I made that happen,didn't I?
No,todd.
I did.
I didn't mean to.
I didn't want to...
but I did.
Welcome to haspel corp.How may i help you?
Hi.
I have an appointment with dennis ryland.
My name's isabelle tyler.
Miss tyler.
Mr. Ryland's expecting you.
Go on up to 24.He's waiting.

Season 03 Episode 06</font>
We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
-Previously on The 4400:
-My name is Daniel Armand.
- KnoW Who I am?
- With the Nova Group?
I called to arrange a truce
and to talk about ShaWn Farrell,
We need to discuss his future,
Because unless you and I can come
to some kind of agreement,
I'm not sure he's gonna have one.
Believe me, I know which bench
I dedicated to my husband and son.
They died in a car accident
shortly before I was abducted.
Our enemies are more resourceful
than we imagined.
And they've let loose a terrible evil
into your time.
This evil, there has to be
- some other way to deal with it.
- There is. You.
You are the other way.
Oh, Tom. Good, you're here.
Yeah, just like always.
Well, come on.
We need to get started.
Started with what?
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Sure you do. Come on, let's go.
She's waiting.
What is this?
I brought her in. You can just do it,
and we can get on with our day.
It?
No.
- No way, I'm not.
- Tom, you're supposed to do this.
- They told you so.
- I know. It's just...
They didn't say why.
- I don't think I can.
- Maybe I'm bad.
Maybe I'll kill a bunch of people.
You can stop it.
I could be responsible for millions
of deaths, unless you do something.
We got a lot to do today.
It's all right, Tom. I don't mind.
- Come on.
- Take the needle.
Come on, Tom.
Do it.
Do it.
I'm sorry.
I can't find it,
I can't find it,
I know you're listening.
I know you put it
somewhere inside of me.
I'm gonna find it.
I can't find it.
I can't find the bug.
I can't find it. I can't find the bug.
I know you put it
inside me somewhere.
I know you're listening.
I'm gonna find it.
I'm gonna get an x-ray
of my whole body.
Maia's it! Maia's it!
- I'm gonna get you, Amy!
- No, you won't.
Yes, I will.
Maia.
- Maia, are you all right?
- It hurts.
I can help you.
It's just a bump, Shawn.
I can make it better.
- Oh, that hurts.
- You're getting better.
Hey, let her go! You're hurting her!
Somebody help!
Let go! Help!
- What's going on?
- He's killing her! Get him away!
Mister Farrell, let go.
Stay away from her!
- Stand back.
- I don't understand. I was healing her.
- What happened?
- I was making her better.
Sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay.
- Maia's vital signs are fine.
There's no lasting damage
that I can detect.
At the moment,
she's mostly just dehydrated.
Sweetheart?
- Mommy?
- What is it?
Why would Shawn hurt me?
Oh, my God. Shawn did this?
He missed some meetings yesterday,
but I had no idea it had gotten this bad.
- How's Shawn? Is he okay?
- We don't know.
We called a psychiatrist for him.
They're back in the bedroom now.
- I wanna see him. He'll feel better.
- lsabelle, not right now.
Let him meet with the doctor
for a while, okay?
Sorry.
This is my daughter lsabelle.
Isabelle, this is Tom Baldwin.
- Hi.
- Shawn told me about you.
Hi.
Hi.
You're staring at me. Why?
How is he?
I gave him a sedative.
He's sleeping right now.
Shawn is experiencing persistent
and powerful auditory hallucinations.
They're contributing
to his delusions.
Delusions? I don't understand.
What's happening to him?
Shawn's symptoms are...
Well, I'm afraid
they're consistent with the onset
of disorganized schizophrenia.
But you're gonna fix him, right?
You're gonna make him better?
Well, I've never seen a case
quite like this.
Typically, schizophrenia
has a gradual onset.
Patients slowly withdraw
from the world
as their symptoms get worse.
But with Shawn, it's almost
as if the disease was just turned on.
Last week, we got a phone call
from Daniel Armand.
He said if we weren't willing
to reach a compromise with Nova,
he'd come gunning for Shawn.
And now it's two days later,
and he just happens to come down
with schizophrenia.
You think the Nova Group
did this to Shawn?
Well, we'll investigate it,
but until the matter's cleared up,
Shawn just can't walk around free.
I mean, okay, he's probably
a victim in this, but his mental state
has been compromised.
He can't control his ability.
Shawn is one of the leaders
of this place.
People love him.
If he just disappears
into the basement at NTAC,
there's gonna be a lot
of unhappiness here.
Nobody's talking
about disappearing anyone.
You need to just distance yourself
from the situation. Just for a second.
Now, we have an insane 4400
with a potentially lethal ability.
This is an ability that he has turned
against my daughter.
If you don't voluntarily remand him
to a psychiatric hospital,
then I'll file a complaint for assault and
take the decision out of your hands.
No!
You can't lock him up.
This isn't his fault.
Isabelle, Shawn is in trouble.
He needs help.
I know he does, and instead,
you just want to abandon him.
He sacrificed for this place.
He told you not to talk to Nova,
even if it meant
they were gonna come after him.
- Now they did, and you cut him loose?
- We're not cutting him loose.
- We are protecting him.
- Oh, by locking him up?
- I guess it's fine for you, right?
- lsabelle, that is not true.
And we are not having this
discussion now. This is not the place.
If you'll agree that Shawn goes
nowhere near a government facility,
we'll commit him to a private hospital
until all this is cleared up.
How much did they tell you
about what I do here at the school?
Not much. You're some sort
of guidance counselor, right?
Something like that. It's more
like a therapist, I guess you could say.
I work with the students here
using my ability.
All the kids here are 4400s,
which means you missed years
of your family's lives.
Your parents had another child
while you were gone.
- Your brother, Curtis?
- Yeah.
Before they got divorced.
I barely know him.
That's where I come in.
It's hard to explain, but if you let me,
I can take you back to the years
when you were gone.
You can meet your brother
when he was baby, see him grow up,
and spend all the time
you need with him,
and build the relationship
you don't have.
I'm sorry. What?
You wanna take me back in time?
No. We'll be going to a world
we create using both our minds.
And it will seem just as real
as this one.
Look, no offense,
but maybe you should worry
about helping yourself.
You think I need help?
You have this sadness inside you.
Not sadness exactly.
I guess rage would be the best word.
It's because of what happened
to your husband and son
all those years ago.
You know about Billy and Paul?
They got killed in a hit-and-run.
The police never caught the guy.
You try to move on...
...and I guess you kind of have.
But you still think about it every day.
And there's still that rage.
How do you know all that?
You have an ability,
and I have an ability.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just not up for this.
So is it okay if I go back to class?
You're right to be mad, you know.
The guy? The driver?
He's kind of out there.
It's not fair.
But you did see Shawn Farrell
on Tuesday?
A home loan from the center.
And how did the meeting end?
Oh, well, congratulations.
That's a really nice neighborhood.
No, no, Mister Donavan.
Thanks for your time.
We'll be in touch
if we need anything further.
You know, your nephew is one
of the leaders of the center.
He sees dozens of 4400s every day.
And the ones that we've spoken to
who have registered abilities with us,
they have minor stuff.
Nothing like the capacity
to induce insanity.
And that's assuming
that whoever did this
had to be in proximity to Shawn
to make it happen.
Whoever?
We basically know who did this.
It was Daniel Armand.
Either he did it, or he gave the order.
Well, no, the truth is we don't actually
know that Shawn's condition
is the result of an attack.
Nova's not claiming credit,
and Shawn's exactly the right age
for onset of schizophrenia.
So it's possible
that we're looking for a crime,
and the only thing
we're gonna find is a tragedy.
Then there's nothing we can do.
I cannot accept that.
Nova threatened Shawn.
Shawn got sick.
For right now,
that's all the cause and effect I need.
You're Zachary?
- Thanks for meeting me out here.
- It's all right.
Matthew said you had something
you wanted to discuss.
About six weeks ago,
a friend of mine from quarantine,
she asked me to meet her
for dinner.
So I go, and she's asking me
all sorts of questions.
Now, she never came right out
and said it,
but I swear she was feeling me out
to see if I would join the Nova Group.
She was recruiting you?
I mean, she used to bitch
about the government all the time.
- I guess she just finally got fed up.
- Zachary.
If you got a name, give it to me.
Jane Nance.
Thank you for coming forward.
Hi.
Todd?
Ms. Mareva. What's up?
Those things you said about me.
They're very private.
How did you know?
Sometimes, when I'm talking
to somebody,
if they feel something real strong,
I feel it too.
And then I know
why they feel that way.
I see it.
So you saw what happened
to my family?
Not the whole thing.
I just get, like, fragments.
I saw the two cars hit.
I saw this guy.
There were empty beer bottles
by his seat.
He thought about getting out.
Calling the cops.
I guess he changed his mind.
The man who hit them,
you know who he is?
Yeah, I already wrote it down.
I figured you'd want it.
"Keane Driscoll."
Security told me you were up here.
What are you doing?
I'm packing Shawn's stuff.
I'm taking him out of the hospital.
Isabelle, I have to caution you
against overreaction.
I know you're worried about Shawn,
but all we have is a tip.
We might know the name
of one person in the Nova Group.
What's my dad gonna do with that?
Let me guess, call NTAC? What are
they gonna do for Shawn that I can't?
They're equipped
to deal with 4400s.
Not as well as I am.
- lsabelle.
- Matthew, get out of my way.
What are you gonna do?
We don't even know if that tip
is any good.
And if this woman, Jane Nance,
is in the Nova Group,
there's no guarantee
she's the one doing this to Shawn.
If she's not, she'll get me closer
to the person who is.
She was recruited into Nova, right?
So she'll know at least one name.
I'll find that person. If they're not
the one, they'll know a name too.
And eventually, I'll find the person
who is hurting Shawn,
and I'll make him stop.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Do you remember the first time
I came to see you?
You were so sad.
You didn't know who you were.
Why you grew up so fast.
Why you were making
your mother so sick.
And I told you,
you were one of the lucky ones.
You have a purpose, a job to do.
I even told you what it was.
Do you remember?
Say it.
I'm supposed to eliminate the 4400.
That's right.
Not everyone from the future
thinks they're a good thing.
Not everyone thinks
they're gonna save the world.
All this talk of a catastrophe the 4400
are supposed to prevent, it's lies.
They are the catastrophe.
All of them.
Your father, Shawn...
And if he's in trouble,
that's good for us.
So you keep telling me.
Goodbye.
No, I can't allow you to do this.
You're not ready to be on your own.
You need me. You need my guidance.
I don't think I do, Matthew.
Today's graduation day.
Shawn?
Isabelle.
We have to go now, okay?
- lsabelle. Isabelle.
- Okay.
My back teeth are melting,
and they're gonna run down my throat.
I can feel it.
It's okay.
I'm gonna make you better.
Just come with me, okay?
Okay?
Her name is Jane Nance,
and she lives about 20 minutes away.
We think the tip is good.
If she really is a member of Nova,
you can bet she'll be ready
to defend herself, so let's be careful.
Here you go, Triton.
Here you go.
You've been a very patient boy.
Fidget?
What did I tell you
about sitting on the TV?
Not yet, Herkie.
Who are you?
We all know what it's like
to hit bottom.
We wouldn't be here if we didn't.
It comes in a different way
for each of us,
that moment when we realize
our drinking is out of control.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's okay. It's okay. Come on in.
Grab a seat.
I was just saying, my name is Keane,
and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi Keane.
Jane Nance!
Oh, my God.
What?
Get those animals away from her.
What the hell happened here?
It's like all these pets she keeps,
they turned on her.
Maybe someone
turned them on her.
He died very quickly.
It could have been a massive stroke,
maybe a coronary.
I'll call an ambulance
and the coroner.
Mister Tyler.
Those two NTAC agents are here
again. They say they need to see you.
Look, Mister Tyler,
Isabelle broke Shawn
out of the hospital.
We know that for a fact.
And now we learn that Matthew Ross,
a 36-year-old man,
just happened to die of a stroke
on the floor of Shawn's living room.
Within the hour,
Jane Nance dies as well.
I mean, are you telling us
that you don't see a connection?
You're talking about my daughter.
She shouldn't have taken Shawn,
I'll admit that.
She can be immature sometimes, yes.
But she is not a killer.
Any idea where lsabelle
may have taken Shawn?
No.
If she calls, I'll try to convince her
to come in and I'll let you know.
That's the best I can do.
Is there anything else?
See you.
Hey.
It's okay to be shy.
I remember my first meeting.
I didn't say anything either.
I was at rock bottom,
embarrassed just to be breathing.
How long ago was that?
About nine years.
I was in a car accident.
The truth is,
I can barely remember it.
I came to and I knew
I had to change my life.
So I did. I've been leading
these meetings for five years now.
How about you?
You have a moment like that?
Diana, we opened a trace
on Shawn's cell phone.
Richard Tyler's too.
If lsabelle calls, we'll be listening.
Does this girl scare you
as much as she scares me?
I mean, never mind what she did
or didn't do today.
You just meet her.
I mean, she looks like a normal kid.
Attractive, maybe a bit naive.
But when she says something,
you realize she's looking at you
like you're an ant
and she's just deciding whether or not
she's gonna rip your legs off.
Every other 4400 had a past
before they were taken, a history.
Not her.
She just kind of sprouted.
She's not even a 4400.
She's something else.
A new category.
We got a hit on the APB.
Shawn's car was spotted
- headed east on Forbes Avenue.
- That's in Everett. Let's go.
Diana, I need to make a stop
at home first.
I'm not taking those.
I'm not taking those.
There's radio antennas
inside of there.
And that's how they hear
what I'm thinking.
- I'm not taking those.
- Shawn.
Shawn, there are no radio antennas.
They're just pills.
They make you feel better.
The label says you're supposed
to take them every four hours.
Shawn, stop that.
Wait a minute. There he is.
It's so late.
You scared me.
I'm sorry. Someone called in a tip
on Shawn's car.
It was abandoned, though.
He's still missing.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
No.
A boy at school, he has this gift.
He sees things,
things that already happened.
He says he saw the accident
that killed Billy.
Oh, my God. Baby.
- Why would he tell you that?
- Because.
He also gave me the name
of the man who did it.
I went to see him, Thomas.
You did what?
He was leading an AA meeting.
He told me he had a car accident
while he was drunk nine years ago.
Alana, sweetie,
if this really is the guy,
- we'll look into it.
- Based on what?
The visions of a 4400
who was a little kid
when the accident happened?
Alana, please.
Don't go see this guy again.
It could be dangerous.
You should pick up, Thomas.
Yeah, but are you sure you're okay?
I'm fine.
Better than your nephew anyway.
Baldwin.
The place is owned by a 4400
named Jorge Molina.
Fire Department found some burnt
remains inside. They think it's him.
- What started the fire?
- They're not sure.
Apparently, Molina had a habit
of leaving oily rags
laying around the garage.
Someone in Health and Safety
gave him a bunch of citations for it.
Said it was a fire hazard.
Guess they were right, huh?
Yeah, either that,
or lsabelle found the name
of another member
of the Nova Group.
- Hello?
- This Will all be over soon, Daddy,
Hello?
I found out who's doing this to Shawn.
It's Daniel Armand.
- lsabelle?
- The last Nova I talked to told me.
Isabelle,
Where are you?
I'm just waiting for him to come home,
and then I'm gonna make him stop.
Isabelle, if you know where Armand is,
we'll tell NTAC.
They'll take care of it.
I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping until Shawn's better.
Daddy, when all this is done,
can I come home?
Will they let me,
or am I in too much trouble?
I don't knoW, Maybe,
If you stop noW, maybe,
Just tell me where you're going
so I can come meet you.
Okay.
Diana, we just intercepted a call
to Richard Tyler's phone.
- It was lsabelle.
- Where is she?
She's headed to an address
in Munhall.
She says Daniel Armand is there.
You'd better not be hurting him.
I'm not. It's almost done.
Isabelle.
Shawn, are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
What happened?
I don't remember anything.
What's Armand doing here?
He was hurting you.
He broke your mind.
That's his ability,
but I made him stop.
He's yours now.
You can do what you want.
Now she wants you to kill me.
I'm not killing anybody, lsabelle.
If you don't, she will.
Is that true?
I did what I had to do
to make you better.
What does it matter anyway?
You're not sick anymore.
I know. I know. Thank you.
But it's over. It's over.
I'm better. We have Armand.
Let's just go.
We can walk away.
You don't really know
this girl at all, do you?
You think she's one of us?
Don't listen to him, lsabelle.
- Stop talking.
- She's not, Shawn.
She killed her way across town
to find me,
and there's no way
she's walking away.
I said stop talking now.
Isabelle, don't. Isabelle, don't.
For the record, Daniel,
I didn't kill your people.
Not exactly.
All I did was turn their abilities
against them.
And what do you do again?
Oh, right.
You make people crazy.
No.
Isabelle.
Isabelle, stop it!
Stop it!
They wanna take my organs out.
All of them.
They're halfway done.
They're halfway done.
Why did you do that to him?
He was still a threat to you, Shawn.
If we just left, what's to keep him
from attacking you again?
Everything I did,
I did to make you better.
I don't regret any of it.
If I had to kill a hundred people,
I would have.
Who are you?
If anyone gets any resistance
from the girl or Daniel Armand,
do not hesitate to use deadly force!
Tom, anything to add?
- No, let's move.
- Stop!
Can't do that, Mr. Tyler.
We need to end this.
Look, if you go in there
with your guns out,
this could end badly for everybody.
Let me talk to lsabelle,
see if I can get her to come out quietly.
You guys have got
the place surrounded, right?
If I'm gone more than five minutes,
you can just come in anyway.
Go.
Isabelle? Shawn?
Richard.
You've gotta talk to her.
You've gotta talk to her.
She wants to fight them.
She's gonna get everyone killed.
Daddy, we can get past them.
You can help me.
You can get the guns
out of their hands, right?
No, lsabelle! We're not here
to fight the government. Not today.
I don't have a choice.
Yes, you do.
Walk out there with me.
You're gonna get in trouble
for breaking Shawn out of the hospital,
but we can deal with it.
I don't know what happened with
Matthew, but we can deal with that too.
But if you go after those agents,
that is it.
You're an enemy of the government.
They will catch you eventually.
They will put you away forever,
I don't care how strong you are.
And there won't be anything
I can do about it.
All this.
I did it to save Shawn,
and he hates me now.
Isabelle.
Isabelle, I don't hate you.
He's just scared, that's all.
We all are.
Let's go.
They're coming out!
Shawn, are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
Daniel Armand's inside.
He's all yours.
So this is what it feels like
to watch someone
get away with murder.
If there's no evidence of foul play,
how can there be a murder?
As for the deaths,
Shawn doesn't remember anything.
There's no witnesses.
So officially, we don't have a case.
Yeah, but she did it.
And I can't help but think
when all this is over,
she's gonna do a lot more.
Their names were Billy and Paul.
Paul was my husband.
Billy was our son.
They were killed
in a hit-and-run accident in 1 997.
The same year you hit bottom.
- What does this have to do with me?
- Everything.
You killed them.
Look...
...I told you before. Nine years ago...
...I was a different man.
Something happened. Something...
...terrible.
And I had a choice.
I could end my life,
or I could try to live it better.
And I decided to live.
And I did do better.
I dedicated myself to it.
I mean, look around. I help people.
You do.
And you probably feel
like that's enough.
I'll bet you do go days,
whole weeks even,
without ever thinking
about that other man, and what he did.
I think about it every day.
It never goes away for me.
And I'm going to make sure
it never goes away for you either.
I won't let you forget them.
I'm fine, Daddy.
They treated me fine.
I just need a little time alone, okay?
Isabelle.
You know, sometime very soon,
we're gonna have to talk
about Matthew.
About all of this.
How did you get in here?
Shut the door. We need to talk.
About what?
Some people want me to kill you.
I was hoping you could tell me why.
Who gave you that?
Long story.
Let's just say the woman
who left it for me, she called you evil.
Said if humanity was gonna survive,
you had to die.
What, you think that's funny?
No.
It's just it seems like a lot of people
have opinions about me.
Either I'm the savior,
or I'm the end of the world.
It's nice to have options, I guess.
That man, Matthew?
The one who had a stroke?
He came to me right after I grew up.
He said I was supposed
to do all kinds of things.
Destroy the 4400. Kill them all.
He told me it was the only way
to save the world.
I told him no.
I might have been conceived
in the future, but I'm not their puppet.
He didn't like that.
He's not around anymore.
Neither are those members
of the Nova Group.
Those people were terrorists.
They were murderers.
They were hurting Shawn.
Look, whoever told you that I'm bad,
that I'm some sort
of walking Armageddon, is wrong.
I turned my back on all that.
I'm not a murderer.
You know what?
I don't care how much I scare you.
I don't think you are, either.
You don't know me.
No?
Let's find out.
Here I am, the angel of death.
The end of the human race,
whatever the hell it is they call me.
I won't move. I promise.
No.
Not yet.
Not until I'm sure.
You're not a murderer.
It's okay.
You should take that with you
in case you change your mind.
You better hope I don't.
I made that happen, didn't l?
No, Todd. I did.
I didn't mean to.
I didn't want to.
But I did.
Welcome to Haspel Corp.
How may I help you?
Hi. I have an appointment
with Dennis Ryland.
- My name's lsabelle Tyler.
- Oh, Miss Tyler.
Mister Ryland's expecting you.
Go on up to 24. He's waiting.
Durant les 60 dernières années
4400 personnes ont été enlevées...
Toutes sont revenues en même temps
Sans aucun souvenir d'où elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines sont revenues
avec de nouvelles capacités.
Tous essaient de renouer...
...avec une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le Salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment, dans les 4400...
On m'a offert un travail
avec les enfants à l'école.
J'ai éventé la surprise, n'est-ce pas ?
Je veux juste que
les choses soient claires...
Le fait que je casse avec Danny
n'a rien à voir avec toi.
Ok.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je suis celui qui t'as tué.
Cette liste est complète ?
Parce que je suis en train de me
demander combien des 4400 tu as tués.
Quoi de neuf ?
Qui sont ces types ?
Ils ont étés amené pour
aider à expédier l'interrogatoire.
Je sais que tu trouves ça dur à croire, Tom,
mais nous sommes du même côté.
Un de nos membres a été compromis.
Je dois assumer le fait
qu'il va révéler mon nom.
Si vous savez où se trouve Armand, nous
préviendrons le NTAC. Ils s'occuperont de ça.
Daniel Armand est à l'intérieur.
Il est tout à vous.
On y est.
Le dernier membre du groupe Nova.
Le dernier à notre connaissance,
de toute façon.
Si nous tenons le bon bout et que
nous amenons Gary Navarro,
Ca annoncerait la fin prochaine
du groupe Nova.
Le tuyau est bon.
Les voilà. Allons-y.
Gary ! c'est fini !
Allez. Allez.
En bas des escaliers.
Tout est clair ?
Clair, Monsieur !
Il n'y a personne ici.
On dirait qu'il vient de partir.
Au beau milieu de la préparation du repas ?
Il a dû savoir que nous allions venir.
Quelqu'un a dû l'avertir.
Ah, Isabelle...
Ah... Isabelle...
Vous ne m'entendez pas.
Bien sûr que si.
Tu disais que tu ne voulais
plus être avec moi.
C'est juste que je ne vois pas pourquoi.
C'en est fini du groupe Nova.
Mon père est au courant pour nous
maintenant.
Il n'y a rien, capable de nous
empêcher d'être ensemble.
Si, il y a quelqu'un.
Moi.
C'est à cause de ce qui est
arrivé à Matthew, pas vrai ?
Tu penses que je l'ai tué...
Et les gens du groupe Nova aussi.
Je n'étais pas dans mon état normal, Isabelle,
donc je ne sais pas ce qui c'est passé.
Bien, je vais te le dire.
Matthew a pété les plombs, des terroristes
sont morts, et tu t'es senti mieux.
Alors c'est quoi la question ?
Je pense juste qu'entre toi et moi c'est
devenu trop intense un peu trop vite.
Tu vois...
Je pensais que c'était le meilleur
de la chose.
Désolé de vous interrompre.
Shawn, il y a quelqu'un qui
veut te voir.
C'est une de tes amies.
Elle a dit que c'était important.
Nikki. Oh, mon dieu.
Que fais-tu ici ?
Ca fait bien longtemps, Shawn.
Ouais.
Sa... salut.
Salut.
Je, j'aurais dû appeler avant.
Non.
Non, c'est très bien.
T'as l'air en forme.
Qu'est-ce que tu es devenue ?
Bien. Bien.
L'école c'est plutôt sympa.
C'est juste que...
Mon père.
Il est tombé malade.
Ton père ? Je suis désolé d'apprendre ça.
C'est un cancer.
Un cancer du pancréas.
Ils ne peuvent plus rien faire.
Shawn ?
Tout va bien ?
Ouais. Hum...
Je dois juste m'occuper de ce truc tout de suite,
alors on en reparle plus tard, ok ?
Ok.
Donc, Amy...
Tu avais l'habitude d'appeler
ta grand-mère "Mimi" ?
Oui.
Je devais passer deux semaines chez
elle chaque année,
mais quand je suis revenue avec
tous les autres 4400,
ma mère m'a dit qu'elle était morte.
Alana Mareva ?
Nous sommes de l'Agence de Sécurité
Nationale.
Vous devez nous accompagner.
C'est à quel sujet ?
Le Pentagone a mendé une commission d'enquête
sur les membres et les origines du groupe Nova.
Nous avons été autorisés à interroger
toutes les personnes concernées.
Et pourquoi je ferais partie des personnes
concernées ?
Madame, on a une liste.
Votre nom est dessus.
Ne faisons pas l'esclandre devant l'enfant.
Comment mon nom est arrivé sur cette liste ?
De quoi suis-je accusée ?
Nous avons une preuve qui suggère que
vous êtes un membre du groupe Nova.
J'ai fait un chèque.
Mon ami Ryan du Centre.
IL est venu me voir un jour, il y a environs six semaines,
et m'a dit qu'il ne pouvait payer sa facture d'électricité.
Ils allaient lui couper le courant s'il ne
venait pas avec l'argent.
C'était un petit prêt, 165 $.
C'est pas une grosse affaire, pas vrai ?
Ryan Freel ?
Nous l'avons embarqué il y a trois jours.
Il fait partie des noms que Daniel
Armand nous a donnés.
Donc ils avaient raison. Il était dans
le groupe Nova.
Ils disent qu'ils peuvent me retenir pour avoir
fourni une aide financière à des terroristes.
C'était juste un prêt, Thomas.
Combien de temps vont-ils me garder ici ?
Ils peuvent te garder pour interrogatoire
sans la moindre charge pendant 36 heures,
mais ça n'arrivera pas jusque-là.
C'est du harcèlement, et cela ne
va pas continuer.
Je vais parler à Ryan Freel.
Je vais lui faire dire que c'était juste
occasionnel, que ça n'a rien à voir avec Nova.
Alana, je te le promets, tout
ceci sera bientôt terminé. Juste...
Assieds-toi, ok ?
Je t'aime.
Je sais que c'est frustrant,
mais il n'y a rien que l'on puisse faire.
Nina, c'est du harcèlement, pur et simple.
Ouais, je le sais,
et je n'aime pas ça non plus,
mais le groupe Nova rend beaucoup
de gens nerveux.
Maintenant que c'est démantelé, les militaires
veulent être sûrs que c'est mort et enterré.
Ouais, on le souhaite tous.
Ce n'est toujours pas une excuse de maintenir
en détention une femme innocente sans aucune raison.
Je suis d'accord, mais le Pentagone nous
veut sur ce cas.
Que ça se fasse de façon privée.
Ils ont embauchée la Haspel Corporation
pour mener l'enquête.
La Haspel Corp ?
Ils font beaucoup de contrats de défense,
pas vrai ?
A l'heure qu'il est, ils focalisent sur
le rapport Nova.
La NSA leur a même prêté des agents
pour faire le travail de terrain.
Maintenant, n'importe quel conglomérat a le droit
d'arrêter et de maintenir des gens en détention ?
Où est le hic ?
Il n'y en a pas beaucoup.
Ecoute, tout ceci est basé sur la discrétion
de l'exécutif chargé de l'enquête.
Alors, qui est l'exécutif ?
J'apprécie ta frustration, Tom.
C'est malheureux que votre petite amie
ait été impliquée dans ce bazar...
mais mon personnel était en train de
s'en occuper.
Votre "personnel" ?
Alana a été retenue par l'Agence de
Sécurité Nationale.
Pour ce que je m'en rappelle, votre vie dans le
service public s'est terminé en circuit fermé au NTAC.
Ouais, il y a eu des moments déplaisants,
mais c'est du passé.
J'ai été censuré pour ma participation
à l'inhibiteur...
Un "Scandale", je crois que vous
devriez l'appeler.
"Scandale" ? Pourquoi n'essayez-vous pas
"complot de meurtre" ?
Vos opinions sont désormais une question de registres,
et non que la majorité des gens sont d'accord avec vous.
De toute manière, après que le gouvernement
se soit occupé de mettre fin à mon emploi,
J'ai rassemblé mes affaires et
j'ai atterri ici à Haspel Corp.
Et Alana est juste apparue dans
votre collimateur, pas vrai ?
Tom, vous pensez vraiment que j'utiliserais votre
petite amie pour procéder à une vendetta personnelle ?
En fait, Dennis, oui, je le pense.
Donc c'est sa punition pour avoir causé la mort
de 28 personnes des 4400...
Une boîte de consultants à six têtes
et un bureau au coin de la rue.
N'ayez pas l'air si surpris, Tom.
Nous avons toujours su que Ryland
avait beaucoup d'appui pour ce qu'il a fait.
Appris quelque chose de nouveau ?
Ouais. Elle est incroyable.
En une semaine, nous avons fait des découvertes
que nous pensions accomplir en des années.
Où avez-vous trouvé cette fille ?
Il ne m'a pas trouvé.
Je l'ai trouvé.
Shawn.
C'est d'accord.
Hé.
C'était ahurissant.
On dirait que mon père pouvait
partir d'ici cet après-midi.
Bien.
Je sais que toute ma famille
t'as remercié encore et encore,
mais je veux le dire aussi, donc...
Merci.
Tout va bien, Nikki.
Tu as l'air si différent.
La dernière fois que je t'ai vu, je ne sais
même pas si tu possédais une ceinture.
Tu avais l'habitude de porter la même
chemise en flanelle chaque jour de la semaine.
Beaucoup de choses ont changé, je suppose.
Maintenant tu t'en sors vraiment bien.
Ceci m'ammène à penser pourquoi tu es venu
en premier lieu, pour dire salut, tu crois ?
J'essayais juste de laisser tout
ceci derrière moi, je suppose. Je ne...
mais je pensais à toi. Enormément.
Je dois y aller, je suppose.
Ouais.
Dis à ton père de ne pas
se ruer au bureau, ok ?
Il a toujours été un bourreau de travail.
Nous venons juste de trouver la liste des appels
téléphoniques dans la place secrète de Gary.
Il y a eu un appel à 11 heures 14.
11 heures 14 ? C'est juste avant que
nous arrivions là-bas.
C'est un appel d'indication. Il le faut.
Il provient de l'intérieur
du centre des 4400.
Ecoutez, je ne sais vraiment pas quoi dire.
Je ne peux pas vous dire pourquoi cet
appel a été passé depuis mon bureau,
Mais ce n'était pas moi.
Heather, nous avons la liste des appels
qui dit que ça provenait de votre poste.
Vous avez dit que l'appel a été passé
aux alentours de 11 heures 10, c'est ça ?
Alors en aucun cas, ça ne pouvait être moi.
Je donnais un cours à une classe de 11 heures
jusqu'à midi.
Je me tenais devant 12 étudiants
pendant l'heure entière.
Je n'ai jamais quitté la pièce.
Quelqu'un d'autre a accès à votre bureau ?
Uniquement le portier, mais vous devrez
demander à la maintenance.
Nous le ferons.
Nous devrons interroger vos étudiants aussi.
Ecoutez, Heather, le NTAC n'est pas la seule
organisation qui enquête sur le groupe Nova.
Il y a beaucoup de gens qui vont s'intéresser
de près à ces listes d'appels téléphoniques,
et ils seront beaucoup moins
amicaux que nous le sommes.
Désolé, messieurs.
C'est comme je l'ai dit...
J'étais en classe.
C'est tout ce que je sais.
Je me suis inquiété à votre sujet
cet après-midi.
Vous avez été absent toute
la journée, encore.
J'étais parti faire une promenade.
J'aimerai faire ça maintenant.
Papa...
J'ai besoin de parler à Shawn.
Dis-lui que je ne peux pas le quitter.
Ce serait une erreur.
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Pour une chose, je ne pense pas
que ce soit le cas.
Je sais combien ça doit
te faire mal maintenant,
mais ça te passera.
Ne me parle pas comme si j'étais une ado.
Il y a des choses que je dois faire.
Ca va devenir très dur, voire dangereux,
Et si Shawn n'est pas avec moi,
cela ne fera qu'empirer les choses.
Pire pour qui ? Toi ?
Non.
Tous les autres.
Ouais ? Et si je dis non ?
Soit plus convainquante.
Heather.
Quoi de neuf ?
Je dois vous parler.
Ecoutez...
J'y ai pensé toute la journée.
Je ne vous ai pas tout dit cet
après-midi.
Il y avait quelqu'un qui avait la
clé de mon bureau.
Ok, cette personne...
J'ai besoin de savoir qui c'était.
Tom...
C'était Alana.
Je n'ai pas voulu dire quoique ce soit
devant votre partenaire.
Je suis sûre que vous comprenez pourquoi.
Tom...
Est-ce que Alana savait que vous
aviez trouvé où ce type, Gary, vivait ?
Ouais, ouais, elle le savait. Je...
J'étais avec elle au téléphone quand on
m'a bippé. je le lui ai dit.
Elle savait que je pourchassais
Gary depuis longtemps.
Heather, allez. Ce n'était pas Alana.
Il doit y avoir une autre explication.
Je l'espère, et j'espère
que vous le trouverez,
mais qu'est-ce que je dois
faire pendant vos recherches ?
Vous l'avez dit vous-même... Vous n'êtes pas
le seul à avoir accès ces listes,
et vous n'êtes pas le seul qui
va venir poser des questions.
Vous direz à tous ceux qui demande la même
chose ce que vous m'avez dit cet après-midi.
Votre alibi est vérifié.
A moins que vous ne disiez
quelque chose de différent,
Personne ne sera capable de prouver que vous avez
prêté cette clé à Alana ou à quelqu'un d'autre.
Heather, Alana n'a pas passé cet appel.
Si vous vous en tenez à votre histoire
un jour de plus, tout ceci sera terminé.
Et si je dis non ?
Elle me poursuivra ? Vous ?
Je ne sais pas,
mais je sais qu'elle est déterminée
à vous ramener.
C'est comme si elle voyait en vous une connection
vers le monde, vers les gens, à une vie normale.
Donc, ce que vous dites c'est
que c'est mon boulot de...
la garder, comment dire, humaine ?
Ca y ressemble, n'est-ce pas ?
Ecoute, Shawn...
Je ne suis pas en train de te dire
quoi faire, mais je fais ceci...
Isabelle n'abandonnera pas,
pas sans combattre,
et nous avons vu tous les deux ce qui
se passe quand ma fille décide de se battre.
Tout va bien, Thomas ?
N'y pensez pas en tant qu'information.
Vous nous aidez à attrapper un criminel.
J'ai besoin que vous me disiez,
A qui avez vous prêté à clé
du bureau de Heather ?
Ma puce, s'il te plaît.
C'est important.
Quelqu'un a compromis notre enquête.
Je n'ai donné la clé à personne.
C'était moi, Thomas.
J'ai appelé Gary Navarro.
Je ne comprends pas.
Es-tu un membre du groupe Nova ?
Non, bien sûr que non.
Alors pourquoi ?
Je te faisais confiance.
Je t'ai dit ce que nous étions en train
de faire, et tu t'en es servie pour me trahir.
Je ne t'ai pas trahi.
Je l'ai fait pour toi.
Combien de fois je t'ai entendu dire que tu te sentais
responsable pour ce qui était arrivé à Gary Navarro ?
Il est venu te voir pour demander de l'aide,
et à la place, le gouvernement l'a utilisé et
la retourné contre ceux de son espèce.
Je n'aime pas ce qui est arrivé à Gary,
mais il a choisi de devenir un terroriste.
Il a rejoint Nova de sa propre initiative.
Gary n'était plus avec le groupe Nova.
Quoi ?
Comment serais-tu au courant de ça ?
Beaucoup de gens au centre sont au courant.
Après que le groupe Nova
ait fait tuer T.J. Kim,
il leur a tourné le dos.
Comment peux-tu croire ça ?
Gary a personnellement essayé
de tuer Dennis Ryland.
Ryland est responsable de la mort
de 28 des 4400.
28 personnes qui auraient pu changer le monde
en mieux ont-ils eu la permission de vivre ?
Il nous a déclaré la guerre.
J'ai failli mourir, Thomas.
Tout ce que Gary a fait,
c'était rendre les coups.
Tu aurais dû me dire
ce que tu allais faire.
Je le voulais...
mais je n'ai pas pu.
Tu étais pris par ton travail.
Tu ne pouvais donner
une autre chance à Gary,
alors je l'ai fait pour toi.
Et maintenant tu vas te tenir à
ses côtés pendant le procès.
Tu as passé cet appel depuis le Centre.
C'est inscrit ici sur les
listes d'appels de Gary.
Ils vont deviner que c'était toi, Alana.
Alors quoi, suis-je supposé mentir
pour toi maintenant ?
Suis-je supposé devenir un complice
de Gary aussi maintenant ?
Je ne te demande pas de faire
quoique ce soit, Thomas.
Tu veux m'impliquer, bien,
mais je crois que j'ai fait
ce qu'il fallait...
et j'espérais que l'homme que j'aime
l'aurait cru aussi.
Nikki, si j'ai payé la facture
d'hôpital de ton père,
et je n'admets pas n'importe quoi,
Disons juste que ce n'est pas
une monstrueuse affaire, ok ?
Je suis content de faire
quelque chose de mon argent.
Abandonner ma vie sociale pour travailler sept jours par
semaine à cet endroit doit avoir ses avantages, pas vrai ?
J'ai vraiment du mal à croire que tu
n'as pas de vie sociale.
Diriger cet endroit est
un gros travail, tu sais ?
En quelque sorte, ça te coupe du monde.
Bon, je n'ai pas 60 000 $,
mais si tu te sens isolé,
peut-être que je pourrai te rendre la pareille
d'une autre façon.
Il y a un nouveau sushi-bar qui vient
d'ouvrir à Belltown.
Ca a l'air plutôt sympa.
Tu aimes les sushis toi maintenant ?
Tu n'es pas le seul à avoir changé.
Donne-moi une seconde.
Salut, Shawn.
As-tu vu mon exemplaire de La Republique ?
(Livre de Platon)
Non, figure-toi que je ne l'ai pas vu.
Re-bonjour.
Je suis Isabelle.
N-Nikki.
Ravie de te rencontrer.
J'ai entendu parler de toi.
Préviens-moi si tu retrouves mon livre.
J'en suis à la moitié.
Donc. Demain soir ?
On va tester ce nouveau paradis du Sushi ?
Oui.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Tom...
Je suis tellement désolée.
Que puis-je faire pour t'aider ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne sais pas ce que je
peux faire, moi-même.
Je ne peux pas dénoncer Alana.
Et si nous attrapons Gary,
il se peut que lui la dénonce.
D'une façon ou d'une autre, sa vie est gâchée.
Tom, il est hors de question que tu fasses
disparaître Gary dans la nature.
Tu passeras pour un traître.
Je dois faire quelque chose, Diana.
C'est d'Alana dont il est question.
En quelque sorte, nous sommes
ensemble depuis plus de 10 ans...
Je me dois de la protéger.
Une fois qu'elle sera en sécurité, alors
on trouvera un moyen de continuer notre vie...
Si cela arrive.
Tu dois aussi penser à ta propre sécurité.
Je pense que la meilleure chose à faire,
que la seule chose à faire,
est de nous retirer de ce dossier.
Et faire quoi ?
Croiser les doigts.
Espérer que Gary se soit payer
un aller simple pour Costa Rica.
Que croyais-tu qu'il allait arriver ?
Je ne sais.
Mais c'est seulement pour 36 heures, c'est ça ?
C'est le temps maximum pendant lequel
ils peuvent la retenir.
Honnêtement, je ne suis pas sûr.
Ils peuvent la détenir aussi longtemps qu'il
leur faudra pour vérifier son alibi.
Nous parlons de Dennis Ryland, là.
Tu m'as dit une douzaine de fois,
qu'il ne recule devant rien
pour obtenir une information.
Il va l'interroger,
et je ne sais pas jusqu'où cela va aller.
Alana...
J'appelerai son bureau demain matin.
Je confirmerai moi-même l'alibi d'Heather.
Je leur donnerai mes notes.
Tout ira dans le dossier.
Pour le moment, c'est tout
ce que je peux faire.
Tu sais...
je suis toujours ravi
de parler à un 4400,
mais je dois avouer...
J'ai été surpris de te trouver derrière
la porte de mon bureau ce matin.
Vous pouvez libérer Heather Tobey.
Ce coup de téléphone à Gary Navarro...
C'est moi qui l'ai fait.
Dennis...
Merci de me recevoir dans
de si courts délais.
A quoi pensais-tu, Tom ?
T'impliquer sentimentalement
avec une 4400...
Ce qu'a fait Alana était
une erreur, c'était mal,
mais Gary ne faisait plus
partie du groupe Nova...
Tu vas vraiment rester là et défendre
Gary Navarro devant moi ?
Le groupe Nova n'est pas
un club de Bridge.
On n'en sort pas comme ça.
Même si Gary essayait,
ça n'absout pas ses autres crimes, dont une
tentative d'assassinat.
Si les docteurs étaient
arrivés 30 secondes plus tard,
je serais mort à l'heure qu'il est.
Je sais à quel point
tu veux l'avoir, Dennis.
Si ça ne tenait qu'à moi,
Gary Navarro n'arriverait même
pas jusqu'au tribunal.
Ok. Oublie Gary.
Est-ce qu'on pourrait...
revenir à Alana ?
J'ai peur qu'il ne soit pas possible
de faire cette distinction.
Ils sont assez liés, tu ne crois pas ?
Alana sera traitée comme n'importe quel
membre du groupe Nova.
Elle n'est pas un membre du groupe Nova !
Dennis...
Dennis.
Nous nous connaissons depuis 25 ans.
Tu dois m'aider.
Comme tu m'as aidé lorsque
j'étais dos au mur ?
Je ne suis pas mesquin, Tom.
J'honorerai notre amitié.
Merci.
J'apprécierai quoique tu fasses.
Je vais dire à la NSA que tu
n'as rien à voir là-dedans.
Tu es peut-être un manipulateur,
mais tu n'es pas un traître.
Pour ce qui est d'Alana,
sa meilleure chance est
de pleinement coopérer
et nous aider à trouver Gary Navarro.
Maintenant tu veux retrouver
Gary Navarro ?
Tom, nous avons déjà passé le dossier
à Roth et Tierney.
Nous devons l'attraper avant eux.
Nous devons l'attraper avant Ryland.
Avant tout le monde.
Ecoute, Ryland veut Gary.
Il en fait une affaire personnelle.
Si nous trouvons Gary les premiers, nous
nous arrangerons avec Ryland directement.
Un unique échange.
Gary contre Alana.
Ainsi Ryland met la main sur Gary,
et tout ceci de façon officieuse.
Aucune arrestation,
aucune procédure embarrassante.
Tu crois vraiment que Ryland sera d'accord ?
Si nous lui agitons Gary sous son nez ?
En un battement de coeur.
Ecoute, Tom.
Tu as sauvé la vie de ma fille.
Je te dois tout pour ça,
et que je ferai n'importe quoi, mais...
c'est dangeureux,
et c'est aller au devant de beaucoup
de problèmes pour...
une femme qui t'a trahi.
Je lui dois bien ça.
Bien plus encore.
Mon fils est incarcéré, Diana.
Alana a toujours été à mes côtés
pour m'aider à traverser ça...
et elle ne mérite pas de croupir dans une
prison secrète pour le reste de sa vie.
En bien...
Tu as une idée par où commencer ?
Oui.
Salut, Shawn.
Isabelle.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je suis venue te parler.
Je sais que tu penses encore à nous.
mais nous sommes toujours amis, non ?
Je peux toujours passer te voir.
Isabelle, les amis ont l'habitude
de frapper avant de rentrer.
Qu'y-a-t-il ?
Je suis venue te parler de Nikki.
Je te connais assez bien.
Je ne pense pas qu'elle soit
la fille qu'il te faut.
Je ne vois pas ce qui te fais
penser qu'elle est avec moi.
Mais si tu as le droit de
penser ce que tu veux.
J'essaye juste de vous protéger.
J'ai juste le sentiment que...
si vous sortez ensemble...
cela va mal finir.
Isabelle...
Qu'est-ce que cela veut dire ?
Tu menaces Nikki à présent ?
Bien sûr que non.
Pourquoi la menacerais-je ?
C'est juste que...
j'ai l'impression que si vous vous...
mettez ensemble...
cela va pas bien se terminer.
Pour toi.
Mais surtout pour elle.
C'est toujours plus dur
pour une fille, tu sais ?
Salut.
Tu vas bien ?
Plus ou moins.
Je veux t'aider, Alana.
je veux te sortir de là.
je ne crois pas que tu le puisses.
Si.
Je pense qu'il y a un moyen,
mais j'ai besoin que tu me fasses confiance.
Rappelles-toi qu'ils écoutent.
Je crois que tu devrais
coopérer avec Dennis Ryland.
Dis-lui tout ce qu'il veut savoir.
Je ne peux pas faire ça, Thomas.
Cela serait de la trahison.
Apprends à vivre avec.
Ecoute-moi. Si tu ne coopères pas,
je ne sais pas si tu vas pouvoir
sortir un jour d'ici.
Je ne peux pas.
Alors je ne peux rien pour toi.
Thomas...
J'étais supposée emmener mes élèves en
excursion à l'aquarium cet après-midi.
J'ai besoin que tu y ailles
et que tu leur laisses un mot.
Il y a un panneau d'affichage
devant l'aquarium.
Tu devras l'y accrocher.
Il doit y avoir écrit dessus :
"Excursion annulée".
Certains élèves vont venir
avec leurs parents.
Quand tu les verras, présente-leurs
mes excuses.
Je ferai en sorte qu'ils comprennent.
C'était un code.
Du moins, je le pense.
Elle m'expliquait comment contacter Gary.
Je ne sais pas Tom.
Cela fait déjà 2 heures.
Laissons-lui encore 15 minutes.
Diana...
Gary, stop !
A terre ! Tout le monde à terre !
Attention ! Attention !
Attention ! A terre !
A terre !
Attention ! Attention !
Laissez-moi passer !
Ne bouge plus, Gary !
Ne bouge plus !
C'est fini, Gary.
Viens. Debout.
Alors vous allez me livrer à Ryland.
Vous savez ce qu'il va me
faire, pas vrai ?
Ryland va m'interroger.
Tu sais de quoi je veux parler.
Tu l'as vu de tes yeux.
Et il va me faire disparaître.
Aucun procès.
Aucune trace.
Je ne lis pas dans les pensées, Gary.
Pas comme toi.
Je n'ai aucune idée de ce que Ryland
va faire de toi.
C'est avec ça que tu comptes garder ta
conscience intacte ?
Tu veux tout savoir ?
Je vais t'échanger contre Alana.
Elle t'a aidé. Maintenant c'est
à ton tour de l'aider.
Tu lui dois bien ça.
Tu t'es mis toi-même dans le pétrin, Gary.
Personne ne t'a forcé à
rejoindre le groupe Nova.
Personne ne t'a forcé
à tuer des gens.
J'étais un joueur de base-ball.
Tout ce que je voulais était atteindre
la première ligue.
C'est tout.
Si je ne vous avez pas rencontré,
je collectionnerais les home-run
à l'heure qu'il est.
Ok. Tu peux y aller...
si tu veux toujours le faire...
mais si tu fais cet arrangement
avec Ryland c'est pour toujours.
Nous devrons vivre avec ça.
Je t'appelle après la rencontre.
Tu vas devoir l'amener aussitôt.
7 heures 30 pile !
Je dois avouer...
Je suis impressionée.
Un grand ponte comme toi,
je pensais que ça faisait attendre
les filles.
Tu es prêt ?
Nikki, écoute.
On ne peut pas faire ça.
Faire quoi ?
Dîner ?
Shawn, il n'y a rien de mal à ça.
C'est ce que font les gens le soir.
Tu sais qu'il s'agit de plus
qu'un simple dîner...
Je suis désolé.
Je ne cherche pas à te repousser.
C'est juste que...
Je ne peux pas faire ça maintenant.
Shawn, je ne comprends pas.
Qu'est-il arrivé ? Un conseiller t'a dit que je ne
convenais pas à ta stratégie de relation publique ?
Non. Rien de tout ça.
Ca va te sembler stupide..
mais te quitter maintenant est la meilleure
chose que je puisse faire pour toi.
D'accord, alors.
Va-t-en.
Au revoir, Nikki.
Donc, Tom,
je suppose que si je suis
d'accord avec cet...
échange que tu proposes...
tu ne livreras pas Navarro au commissariat
le plus proche, c'est ça ?
Tu dis Non,
et tu peux dire dire adieu à Navarro.
Je lui trouverai un passeport,
un billet d'avion...
Il sera dans un pays du tiers-monde
dès demain.
Et si je décide de jouer le jeu ?
Tu veux savoir si je vais poser des questions
sur Gary Navarro une fois que tu l'auras emmené ?
Non.
Je ne dirais rien.
Ca va pas être facile de faire disparaître
les charges pesant contre Alana.
Tu y arriveras, Dennis.
J'ai confiance en toi.
Allons-y.
Ecoutez...
Prenez ce trousseau de clefs.
la clef bleue ouvre un coffre de dépôt.
Il y a huit lettres à l'intérieur.
J'aimerais que vous les envoyiez.
Ces lettres, à qui sont-elles adressées ?
Huit familles.
Partout dans le monde.
Ton travail pour la NSA.
Ce sont les familles de 4400 que tu as
aidé à retrouver.
Eh bien, je me suis dit...
il est temps de leurs dire ce qui s'est passé.
Leurs donner le fin mot
de l'histoire.
C'est le moins que je puisse faire.
En fait, c'est la seule chose que je puisse faire.
Ca va ?
Je suis désolée.
C'est pas grave.
Je sais que ce n'était pas ton idée.
Ravi d'avoir pu travailler
de nouveau avec toi, Tom.
Eh bien. Tout s'est bien passé.
Dis-moi. Pourquoi est-ce que je sens
un noeud dans mon estomac ?
Ce n'est pas facile de condamner
quelqu'un à mort.
Du calme derrière.
C'est bon.
Laisse-le prier.
Attention.
Sortez de la voiture !
Sortez !
Garder vos mains où je peux les voir !
En l'air !
Garder vos mains où je peux les voir !
Ca va ?
Oui.
Tom, réfléchis-y à deux fois.
Tom, tu laisses un terroriste s'en tirer.
Non, j'étais un soldat.
Vous m'avez créé.
Tout ce que j'ai fait a été
de changer de camp.
Et bien devinez quoi...
Maintenant, j'ai fini de me battre.
je m'éloigne de la guerre.
Tu ne peux aller nulle part.
Tu as tout un tas de charges fédérales
au-dessus de la tête,
notamment une tentative d'assassinat.
Les meurtriers s'en sortent
toujours, Dennis.
Certains se retrouvent même à des postes
tranquilles dans les plus grandes entreprises.
Très malin, Tom.
As-tu pensé à ce que cela signifie
pour ta copine ?
Faire d'elle une fugitive est une curieuse
façon de montrer ton amour.
Je préfère fuir plutôt
que te trahir un 4400 pour toi.
Skouris...
Tu es censée est la tête pensante.
Vas-tu vraiment risquer ta carrière à cause
de la petite croisade de ton partenaire ?
Je ne le vois pas de cet oeil, Dennis,
et si tu tiens à ton job,
tu ne diras rien de tout ça.
Un 4400 que tu as toi-même fait libérer
d'un centre de détention militaire ?
Un échange secret dans un coin reculé ?
Ca fait un peu désordre.
A mon avis...
tout cela devrait resté officieux.
Allons-y.
Ravi d'avoir pu travailler
de nouveau avec toi, Dennis.
Il y a deux cartes
d'identités là-dedans,
et il y a assez d'argent pour que vous
viviez un moment.
La frontière Canadienne est à 50 km.
Je la franchirais dès que je le pourrais.
Ryland va vous chercher.
Oui.
Vous savez, c'est...
voilà 2 ans que je vous ai rencontré
et je me rappelle que aviez dit que
vous m'aideriez.
Eh bien, ça fait longtemps maintenant,
mais je crois que finalement
vous l'avez fait.
Merci.
Je n'ai jamais voulu que ça se termine
entre nous, Thomas, jamais...
et surtout pas ici, comme ça.
Ce n'est pas forcément fini.
Je peux venir avec toi.
Tu ne peux pas.
Tu dois rester ici.
Tu es le seul homme bien
restant dans ce combat.
Je trouverais le moyen de te ramener.
Je te le promets.

over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted
all at once they were returned
with no memory of
where they've been
they haven't aged a day
and some have returned
with new abilities
all are trying to reconnect...
...with a life interrupted
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
I've been offered a job working with the children at the school.
I blew the surprise,didn't I?
I just want to make one thing clear--
me breaking up with danny has nothing to do with you.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
I'm the guy who killed you.
Is this list complete?
Because I'm just wondering how many 4400s you did kill.
What's up?
Who are these guys?
They've been brought in to help expedite the interrogation.
I know you find this hard to believe,tom,but we're on the same side.
One of our members has been compromised.
I have to assume he's going to give up my name.
If you know where armand is,we'll tell ntac.They'll take care of it.
Daniel armand's inside.
He's all yours.
This is it.
The last member of the nova group.
The last one we know about,anyway.
If this tip is good and we bring in gary navarro,
this could pretty much be the end for the nova group.
The tip is good.
Here they are.Let's go.
Gary! It's over!
Go. Go.
Downstairs.
Clear.
Clear,sir!
There's nobody here.
Looks like he just left.
In the middle of making lunch?
He must have known we were coming.Someone must have tipped him off.
Ah,isabelle...
ah... isabelle...
you're not hearing me.
Sure I did.
You said you don't want to be with me anymore.
I just don't see why.
The nova group's gone.
My dad knows about us now.
There's nothing to stop us from being together.
Yes,there is.
Me.
This is because of what happened to matthew,right?
You think I killed him...
and the people from the nova group,too.
I wasn't in my right mind,isabelle,so I don't know what happened.
Well,then I'll tell you.
Matthew had a stroke,some terrorists died,and you got better.
What's to question?
I just think that you and i got a little too intense too fast.
See...
I thought that was the best part.
Sorry for the interruption.
Shawn,there's someone here to see you.
She's a friend of yours.
She says it's important.
Nikki.Oh,my god.
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time,shawn.
Yeah.
H-hi.
Hi.
I-I should have called first.
No.
No,it's fine.
You look great.How've you been?
Good. Good.
School's kind of fun.
It's just...
my father.
He's been sick.
Your dad?I'm sorry to hear that.
It's cancer.
It's in his pancreas.
There's nothing they can do.
Shawn?
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Um...
I just need to deal with this thing now,so we'll talk later,okay?
Okay.
So,amy...
you used to call your grandmother "mimi"?
Yes.
I'd go stay with her for two weeks every year,
but when I came back with all the other 4400s,
my mom told me she was gone.
Alana mareva?
We're from the national security agency.
You need to come with us.
What is this about?
The pentagon has commissioned a study on the membership and the origins of the nova group.
We've been authorized to interview all persons of interest.
And why would I be a person of interest?
Ma'am,we have a list.
Your name is on it.
Let's not make a scene in front of the child.
How did my name get on the list?
What am I being accused of?
We have evidence that suggests you're a member of the nova group.

I wrote a check.
My friend ryan at the center.
He came up to me one day about six weeks ago,said he couldn't pay his power bill.
They were going to shut it off if he didn't come up with the money.
It was a small loan.$165.
No big deal,right?
Ryan freel?
We picked him up three days ago.
He's one of the names daniel armand gave us.
So they were right.He was in nova.
They say they can hold me for providing financial support to terrorists.
It was just a loan,thomas.
How long are they going to keep me here?
They can hold you for questioning without any charge for 36 hours,
but it's not going to come to that.
This is harassment,and it's not going to continue.
I'm going to talk to ryan freel.
I'll get him to admit that this was just a casual thing,that it had nothing to do with nova.
Alana,I promise,this is all going to be over soon.Just--
Just sit tight,okay?
I love you.
I know it's frustrating,but there's nothing we can do.
Nina,it's harassment,pure and simple.
Yeah,I know it is,and I don't like it either,
but the nova group made a lot of people nervous.
Now that it's broken,the military want to make sure that it's dead and gone.
Yeah,we all do.
It's still no excuse to hold an innocent woman based on absolutely nothing.
I agree,but the pentagon went around us on this one.
They went private.
They hired the haspel corporation to conduct the study.
The haspel corp?
They do a lot of defense contracting,don't they?
Right now,they're focusing on this nova report.
Nsa even loaned them agents to do field work.
Now some conglomerate has the right to arrest and detain people?
Where's the oversight?
There isn't a lot.
Look,this whole thing runs on the discretion of the executive in charge of the study.
So who's this executive?
I appreciate your frustration,tom.
It's unfortunate that your girlfriend got involved in this mess...
but my people were just being thorough.
Your "people"?
Alana's being held by the national security agency.
The way I remember it,your life in public service ended with a perp walk through ntac.
Yeah,there were some unpleasant moments,but that's the past.
I was censured for my part in the inhibitor...
"scandal,"I guess you'd call it.
"Scandal"?Why don't you try "murderous plot"?
Your opinions are already a matter of record,not that the majority of people agree with you.
Anyway,after the government saw fit to terminate my employment,
I weighed my offers and wound up here.Haspel corp.
And alana just happened to wind up in your crosshairs,right?
Tom,do you think I would use your girlfriend to prosecute some kind of personal vendetta?
Actually,dennis,yeah,I do.
So that's his punishment for causing the deaths of 28 4400s--
a six-figure consulting gig and a corner office.
Don't act so surprised,tom.
We always knew ryland had a lot of support for what he did.
Learning anything new?
Yeah.She's incredible.
In a week,we've made discoveries we thought it would take years to get to.
Where'd you find this girl?
He didn't find me.
I found him.
Shawn.
It's all right.
Hey.
That was amazing.
It looks like my father could walk out of here this afternoon.
Good.
I know my whole family just thanked you,again and again,
but I wanted to say it,too,so...
thanks.
It's all right,nikki.
You look so different.
Last time I saw u,I don't think you even owned a belt.
You used to wear the same flannel shirt every day for a week.
A lot's changed,I guess.
Now you're doing so great.
It kind of makes me wonder why you never called,just to say hi,you know?
I was just trying to put everything behind me,I guess.I don'T...
but I thought about you. A lot.
I got to go,I guess.
Yeah.
Tell your dad not to hurry back to the office,okay?
He always was a workaholic.
We just got the phone records in from gary's safe house.
A call came in at 11:14 A.M.
11:14?That's right before we got there.
It's a tip-off call.It had to be.
It came from inside the 4400 center.
Look,I really don't know what to say.
I can't tell you why that call came from my office,
but I didn't make it.
Heather,we've got phone records that say it came fromour extension.
You said the call was made around 11:10,right?
Then there's no way it could have been me.
I was teaching a class from 11:00 to noon.
I was standing in front of 12 students for the entire hour.
I never left the room.
Anyone else have access to your office?
Just the janitor,but you'd have to ask maintenance.
We will.
We'll need to talk to your students as well.
Look,heather,ntac isn't the only organization investigating the nova group.
There's going to be a lot of people looking at those phone records,
and they're all going to be less friendly than we are.
Sorry,guys.
It's like I said--I was in class.
That's all I know.
I got a little worried about you this afternoon.
You were gone all day again.
I was out walking.
I like to do that now.
Dad...
I need you to talk to shawn.
Tell him he can't break up with me.
It would be a mistake.
I can't do that.
For one thing,I don't think it is.
I know how much it must hurt right now,
but you'll get over it.
Don't talk to me like I'm a teenager.
There are things I have to do.
They're going to be really hard,dangerous,
and if shawn's not with me,
it's going to make things worse.
Worse for who? You?
No.
Everyone else.
Yeah? And what if he says no?
Be more convincing.
Heather.
What's up?
I need to talk to you.
Listen...
I've been thinking all day about this.
I didn't tell you everything this afternoon.
There was someone who had the key to my office.
Okay,this person...
I need to know who it was.
Tom...
it was alana.
I didn't want to say anything in front of your partner.
I'm sure you understand why.
Tom...
did alana know that you found out where this guy,gary,was living?
Yeah,yeah,she did.I...
I was on the phone with her when the tip came in.I told her.
She knew we'd been chasing gary for a long time.
Heather,come on.It wasn't alana.
There has to be some other explanation.
I hope so,and I hope you find it,
but what do I do while you're looking?
You said it yourself--you're not the only one with access to those records,
and you're not the only one who's going to come asking questions.
You tell anyone who asks the same thing you told me this afternoon.
Your alibi checks out.
Unless you say differently,
no one is going to be able to prove you lent that key to alana or anyone else.
Heather,alana didn't make that call.
If you just stick to your story for one more day,this whole thing will be over.
What if I say no?
She comes after me?You?
I don't know,
but I know she's determined to get you back.
It's like she sees you as her one connection to the world,to people,to a normal life.
So,what you're saying is it's like my job to...
keep her,I don't know,human?
It sounds that way,doesn't it?
Look,shawn...
I'm not trying to tell you what to do,but I do know this--
isabelle's not giving up,not without a fight,
and we've both seen what happens when my daughter decides to fight.
Is everything all right,thomas?
Don't think about it as informing.
You're helping us catch a criminal.
I need you to tell me,
who did you lend heather's office key to?
Sweetie,please.This is important.
Somebody compromised our investigation.
I didn't give the key to anyone.
It was me,thomas.
I called gary navarro.
I don't understand.Are you a member of the nova group?
No,of course not.
Then why?
I trusted you.
I told you what we were doing,and you used it to betray me.
I wasn't betraying you.
I did it for you.
How many times have I heard you say that you felt responsible for what happened to gary navarro?
He came to you for help,
and instead,the government used him and turned him against his own kind.
I don't like what happened to gary,
but he chose to become a terrorist.
He joined nova of his own free will.
Gary wasn't with the nova group anymore.
What?
How would you even know that?
A lot of people at the center know it.
After the nova group had T.J. Kim murdered,
he turned his back on them.
How can you even believe that?
Gary personally tried to murder dennis ryland.
Ryland is responsible for the death of 28 4400s.
28 people that might have changed the world for the better were they allowed to live.
He declared war on us.
I almost died,thomas.
All gary did was fight back.
You should have told me what you were going to do.
I wanted to...
but I couldn'T.
You were bound by your job.
You couldn't give gary another chance,
so I did it for you.
And now you're going to stand trial right alongside him.
You made that phone call from the center.
It's right there on gary's phone records.
They'll figure it out it was you,alana.
So,what,am I supposed to lie for you now?
Am I supposed to become gary's accomplice too now?
I'm not asking you to do anything,thomas.
You want to turn me in,fine,
but I believe I did the right thing...
and I hoped the man I love would believe it,too.
Nikki,if I did pay off your dad's hospital bill,
and I'm not admitting to anything,
let's just say that it's not that big of a deal,okay?
I'm glad to do something with my money.
Giving up my social life to work seven days a week at this place has to have its perks,right?
I have a hard time believing that you don't have a social life.
Running this place is a big job,you know?
It kind of cuts you off from the world.
Well,I don't have $60,000,
but if you're feeling isolated,
maybe I can pay you back in another way.
There's a new sushi place that opened in belltown.
It's supposed to be pretty cool.
You like sushi now?
You're not the only one who can change.
Just give me a second.
Hey,shawn.
Have you seen my copy of the republic in here?
No,you know what?I haven't seen it.
Hello again.
I'm isabelle.
N-nikki.
Nice to meet you.
I've heard of you.
Well,let me know if you find my book.
I'm right in the middle of it.
So tomorrow night?
We're going to check out this new sushi place?
yeah.
Oh,my god.
Tom...
I'm so sorry.
Anything I can do to help?
I don't know.
I don't know what i can do.
I can't just turn alana in.
And if we do catch gary,eventually,he's going to give her up,
so either way,her life is ruined.
Well,tom,there's no way you can try and shake this agency off gary's scent.
You'll wind up a felon yourself.
I have to do something,diana.
We're talking about alana.
One way or another,we've been together for more than a decade.We...
I have to protect her.
Once I know she's safe,then I can figure out how we move on.
If we move on.
You need to keep yourself safe,too.
I think that the best thing that we can do,
the only thing we can do,
is to take ourselves off this case.
And do what?
Cross your fingers.
Hope gary buys himself a one-way ticket to costa rica.
What did you expect to happen?
I don't know.
But it's only for 36 hours,right?
That's all they can hold her for.
Honestly,I'm not sure.
They can hold her for as long as it takes to investigate her alibi.
We're talking about dennis ryland here.
You've told me a dozen times,
he'll do whatever it takes to get information.
He's going to interrogate her,
and I don't know how far it's going to go.
Alana...
I'll call his office in the morning.
I checked out heather's alibi myself.
I'll give them my notes.
It'll all go on the record.
Right now,that's all I can do.
You know...
I'm always happy to talk to one of the 4400,
but I have to say,
I was surprised to find you waiting outside my office this morning.
You can release heather tobey.
That phone call to gary navarro--
I was the one who made it.
Dennis...
thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
What were you thinking,tom?
To get romantically involved with a 4400...
what alana did was misguided,it was wrong,
but gary wasn't part of the nova group anymore--
are you actually going to stand here and defend gary navarro to me?
The nova group isn't a bridge club.
You don't just leave.
Even if gary tried to,
that doesn't absolve his other crimes,which include attempted murder.
If the doctors had gotten to me 30 seconds later,
I would have been dead.
I know how badly you want him,dennis.
If it was up to me,
gary navarro would never even make it to trial.
Okay,forget about gary.
Can we just...
concentrate on alana?
Well,I'm afraid it's not possible to make that distinction.
They're kind of intertwined,aren't they,tom?
Alana will be prosecuted like any other member of the nova group.
She's not a member of the nova group!
Dennis...
dennis.
We've known each other for 25 years.
You have to help me.
Like you helped me when my back was to the wall?
I'm not a petty man,tom.
I'll honor our relationship.
Thank you.
I appreciate anything you can do.
I'll tell nsa you had nothing to do with this.
You may be a dupe,but you're not a traitor.
And as for alana,
her best chance of seeing mercy is to cooperate fully
and help us find gary navarro.
Now you want to catch gary navarro?
Tom,we've already passed the case off to roth and tierney.
We've got to get him before they do.
We've got to get him before ryland does.Before anyone.
Look,ryland wants gary.
It's a personal thing.
If we can get gary first,we can deal with ryland directly.
A straight-up trade.
Gary for alana.
So ryland gets his hands on gary,
and it happens with no official record.
No arrest,none of that sticky due process.
You really think that ryland's going to agree to that?
If we dangle gary in front of him,in a heartbeat.
Look,tom,you saved my daughter's life.
I owe you everything for that,
and I'll do what you want here,but...
this is dangerous,
and it's a lot of trouble to go to for A...
a woman who just betrayed you.
I owe her that much.
More than that.
My son is incarcerated,diana.
Alana's been right there with me all the way through it...
and she doesn't deserve to rot in some secret prison for the rest of her life.
Well...
any idea where we'd start?
Yeah.
Hey,shawn.
Isabelle.
What are you doing in here?
I came by to talk.
I know you're still thinking about us,
but we're still friends,right?
I can still drop by.
Well,isabelle,usually,friends knock.
What's up?
I came to talk to you about nikki.
I know you pretty well.
I don't think she's the right girl for you.
Well,I don't know why you think she's my girl.
You're entitled to your opinion,though,I guess.
I'm just trying to protect you.
I just have this feeling that...
if you guys get together...
it's going to end badly.
Isabelle...
what does that mean?
Are you threatening nikki now?
Of course not.
Why would I threaten nikki?
It's just...I have this feeling that if you two...
hook up...
it's not going to end well.
Not for you.
Especially not for her.
It's always harder on the girl,you know?
Hey.
You doing okay?
More or less.
I want to help you,alana.
I want to get you out of here.
I don't think you can.
I do.
I think there's a way,but I need you to trust me.
remenber theyire listening
I think you should cooperate with dennis ryland.
Tell him whatever he wants to know.
I can't do that,thomas.
That would be a betrayal.
Learn to live with it.
Listen to me--if you don't cooperate,
I don't think you're ever going to get out of here.
I can'T.
Then I can't help you.
Thomas...
I was supposed to take the students on a field trip to the aquarium this afternoon.
I need you to go there and leave them a note.
There's a bulletin board outside the aquarium.
You should put it there,
and it should say,"field trip canceled."
Some of the kids will show up with their parents.
When you see them,give them my apologies.
I'll make sure they understand.
It was a code.
At least,I think it was.
She was telling me how to get ahold of gary.
Well,I don't know,tom.It's already been two hours.
Let's give it another 15 minutes.
Diana...
gary,stop!
Get down!Everybody get down!
Look out! Look out!
Look out! Get down!
Get down!
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!
Don't move,gary!
Don't move!
It's over,gary.
Come on. Get up.
So you're going to turn me over to ryland.
You know what he's going to do to me,right?
Ryland is going to interrogate me.
You know all about that.
You've seen that firsthand.
And then he's going to disappear me.
No trial.
No record.
I'm not a mind reader,gary.
Not like you.
I have no idea what ryland's going to do with you.
That's how you're going to get throughthis little hand-off with your conscience intact?
You want to know?
I'm trading you for alana.
She helped you.Now it's your chance to help her.
You owe her that much.
You made your own bed,gary.
Nobody forced you to join nova.
Nobody forced you to kill people.
I was a baseball player!
I was worried about making the major leagues.
That's it.
If I hadn't met you two,
I'd be shagging grounders right now.
Okay,you should go--
if you still want to,that is--
but if you make this deal with ryland,it's forever.
We live with this.
I'll call you after the meet.
You're going to have to move him right away.
7:30 on the nose.
I got to say,I'm impressed.
Big mogul like you,
figured that you'd keep a girl waiting.
You ready to go?
Nikki,listen,we can't do this.
Do what?
Dinner?
Shawn,it's not a big deal.
That's what people do at night.
You know this is about more than just dinner...
I'm sorry.I don't mean to stand you up.
I just...
I just can't do this right now.
Shawn,I don't get it.
What happened?Did some adviser tell you that I don't fit in with your pr strategy?
No,nothing like that.
It's going to sound like a stupid guy thing...
but me leaving here right now is the best thing I can do for you.
All right,then.
Go.
Bye,nikki.
So,tom,
I'm guessing that if I don't agree to this...
trade you're proposing...
you're not going to drop navarro off at the nearest police station,are you?
You say no,
and you can forget about getting your hands on gary navarro.
I'll get him a passport,a plane ticket...
he'll be in a third world country by this time tomorrow.
And if I decide to play along?
You want to know whether I'll be asking questions about gary navarro after you drive away with him?
No.
I won't be.
It's going to be tricky to make the charges against alana go away.
You can do it,dennis.
I have faith in you.
Let's go.
Listen...
takes this key ring.
The blue key opens a safe deposit box.
There are eight letters inside,
and I'd appreciate it if you'd mail them.
These letters,who are they addressed to?
Eight families.
All over the world.
Your nsa work.
Those are the families of the 4400s that you helped target.
Well,I figured it...
it's time to let them know what happened.
Give them a sense of closure.
Seems like the least I can do.
Seems like the only thing I can do,actually.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I know it wasn't your idea.
Nice working with you again,tom.
Well,that went well.
Tell me,why do I have such a weird feeling in my stomach?
It's not easy to sentence a man to death.
Quiet back there.
It's all right.
Let him pray.
Look out!
Get out of the car!Get out!
Keep your hands where I can see them!
Up!
Keep your hands where I can see them!
You okay?
Okay.
Tom,you need to think about this.
Tom,you're letting a terrorist walk free.
No,I was a soldier.
You created me.
All I did was switch sides.
Well,guess what--now I'm done fighting.
I'm walking away from the war.
There is no walking away.
You've got numerous federal charges hanging over your head,
including attempted murder.
Murderers walk free all the time,dennis.
Some of them even get cushy jobs at fortune 500 companies.
Very cute,tom.
Have you thought about what this means for your girlfriend?
Making her a fugitive is kind of a funny way of showing your love.
I'd rather be on the run than be responsible for handing over a 4400 to you.
Skouris...
you're supposed to be the level-headed one.
Are you really going to throw your career away because your partner is on some personal crusade?
Well,I don't see it that way,dennis,
and if you want to hold on to your job,
you won't say anything about this.
A 4400 you personally signed out of a military detention facility?
A secret trade in a remote location?
It's all kind of messy.
I'm guessing...
this one stays off the books.
Let's go.
Nice working with you again,dennis.
There's two I.D.S in there,
and there's enough cash to last you for a while.
The canadian border's about 30 miles away.
I'd cross as soon as you can.
Ryland will be looking.
Yeah.
You know,it'S...
it's been almost two years since I met you two,
and I remember that you said that you would help me.
Well,it's been a long time coming,
but I guess you finally came through.
Thank you.
I didn't want us to end,thomas,ever...
but especially not here,like this.
It doesn't have to end.
I can come with you.
You can'T.
You need to be here.
You're one of the only good men left in this fight.
I'll find a way to bring you back.
I promise.

Proudly Presents
We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
I've been offered a job
working with the children
at the school.
I blew the surprise, didn't l?
I just wanna make one thing clear.
Me breaking up with Danny
has nothing to do with you.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
I'm the guy who killed you.
Is this list complete, huh?
Because I'm just wondering
how many 4400s you did kill.
What's up? Who are these guys?
They've been brought in
to help expedite the interrogation.
I know you find this hard to believe,
Tom, but we are on the same side.
One of our members
has been compromised.
I have to assume
he's gonna give up my name.
If you know where Armand is,
we'll tell NTAC. They'll take care of it.
Daniel Armand's inside. He's all yours.
This is it.
The last member of the Nova Group.
It's the last one
we know about, anyway.
If this tip is good
and we bring in Gary Navarro,
this could pretty much
be the end for the Nova Group.
The tip is good.
All right, here they are. Let's go.
Move. Move.
Gary! It's over!
- Go. Go.
- Downstairs.
- Room searched.
- You two, that way.
- Got it.
- Clear.
Check over here.
Clear, sir.
There's nobody here.
Looks like he just left.
In the middle of making lunch?
He must have known we're coming.
Someone must have tipped him off.
Isabelle.
Isabelle.
You're not hearing me.
Sure, I did.
You said you don't wanna
be with me anymore.
I just don't see why.
The Nova Group's gone.
My dad knows about us now.
There's nothing to stop us
from being together.
Yes, there is.
Me.
This is because of what happened
to Matthew, right?
You think I killed him.
And the people
from the Nova Group too.
I wasn't in my right mind, lsabelle,
so I don't know what happened.
Well, then I'll tell you.
Matthew had a stroke,
some terrorists died
and you got better.
What's to question?
I just think that you and l
got a little too intense, too fast.
See, I thought that was the best part.
Sorry for the interruption.
Shawn, there's someone here
to see you.
She's a friend of yours.
She says it's important.
Nikki. Oh, my God.
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Shawn.
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I should have called first.
- No.
No, it's fine.
You look great. How have you been?
Good. Good. School's kind of fun.
It's just...
My father.
He's been sick.
Oh, your dad? I'm sorry to hear that.
It's cancer.
It's in his pancreas.
There's nothing they can do.
Shawn?
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
I just need to deal with this thing now.
So we'll talk later, okay?
Okay.
So, Amy, you used to call
your grandmother Mimi?
Yes. I'd go stay with her
for two weeks every year.
But when I came back
with all the other 4400s,
my mom told me she was gone.
Alana Mareva?
We're from
the National Security Agency.
You need to come with us.
What is this about?
The Pentagon has commissioned
a study on the membership
and the origins of the Nova Group.
We've been authorized
to interview all persons of interest.
And why would I be
a person of interest?
Ma'am, we have a list.
Your name is on it.
Let's not make a scene
in front of the child.
How did my name get on the list?
What am I being accused of?
We have evidence that suggests
you're a member of the Nova Group.
I wrote a check.
My friend, Ryan, at the Center,
came up to me one day
about six weeks ago.
He said he couldn't pay his power bill.
They were gonna shut it off
if he didn't come up with the money.
It was a small loan, $1 65.
- No big deal, right?
- Ryan Freel?
We picked him up three days ago.
He's one of the names
Daniel Armand gave us.
So they were right. He was in Nova.
They say they can hold me
for providing financial support
to terrorists.
It was just a loan, Thomas.
How long are they
gonna keep me here?
They can hold you for questioning,
without any charge, for 36 hours.
But it's not gonna come to that.
This is harassment.
It's not gonna continue.
I'm gonna talk to Ryan Freel.
I'll get him to admit
that this is just a casual thing.
That it had nothing to do with Nova.
Alana, I promise this is all
gonna be over soon, just--
Just sit tight, okay?
I love you.
I know it's frustrating,
but there's nothing we can do.
Nina, it's harassment, pure and simple.
Yeah, I know it is.
And I don't like it either.
But the Nova Group
made a lot of people nervous.
Now that it's broken, the military wanna
make sure that it's dead and gone.
Yeah, we all do.
It's still no excuse to hold an innocent
woman based on absolutely nothing.
Well, I agree.
But the Pentagon
went around us on this one.
They went private.
They hired the Haspel Corporation
to conduct the study.
Haspel Corp? They do a lot
of defense contracting, don't they?
Yeah, right now, they're focusing
on this Nova report.
NSA even loaned them agents
to do field work.
Now some conglomerate has
the right to arrest and detain people?
Where is the oversight?
There isn't a lot.
Look, this whole thing
runs on the discretion
of the executive in charge of the study.
So who's this executive?
I appreciate your frustration, Tom.
It's unfortunate that your girlfriend
got involved in this mess.
But my people are just being thorough.
Your people?
Alana's being held
by the National Security Agency.
The way I remember it,
your life in public service ended
with a perp walk through NTAC.
Yeah, there were
some unpleasant moments.
But that's the past.
I was censured for my part in the
inhibitor scandal, I guess you'd call it.
"Scandal"? Why don't you try
"murderous plot."
Your opinions
are already a matter of record.
Not that the majority of people
agree with you.
Anyway, after the government saw fit
to terminate my employment,
I weighed my offers
and wound up here. Haspel Corp.
And Alana just happened to wind up
in your crosshairs, right?
Tom, do you think
I would use your girlfriend
to prosecute some kind
of personal vendetta?
Actually, Dennis, yeah, I do.
So that's his punishment
for causing the deaths of 28 4400s?
A six-figure consulting gig
and a corner office.
Don't act so surprised, Tom.
We always knew Ryland
had a lot of support for what he did.
Learning anything new?
Yeah. She's incredible.
In a week, we've made discoveries
we thought it would take years to get to.
Where'd you find this girl?
He didn't find me.
I found him.
Shawn.
It's all right, Jimmy.
Hey.
That was amazing.
It looks like my father could walk
out of here this afternoon.
Good.
And I know my whole family
just thanked you again and again
but I wanted to say it too.
- So thanks.
- It's all right, Nikki.
You look so different.
Last time I saw you, I don't think
you even owned a belt.
You used to wear the same
flannel shirt every day for a week.
A lot's changed, I guess.
And now you're doing so great.
Kind of makes me wonder
why you never call
just to say hi, you know?
I was just trying to put everything
behind me, I guess.
But I thought about you a lot.
- I've gotta go, I guess.
- Yeah.
Tell your dad not to hurry back
to the office, okay?
He always was a workaholic.
We just got the phone records
in from Gary's safe house.
A call came in at 1 1 :1 4 a.m.
Eleven-fourteen?
That's right before we got there.
It's a tip-off call. It had to be.
It came from inside the 4400 Center.
Look, I really don't know what to say.
I can't tell you why that call
came from my office,
but I didn't make it.
Heather, we've got phone records
that say it came from your extension.
You said the call
was made around 1 1 :1 0, right?
Then there's no way
it could have been me.
I was teaching a class
from 1 1 to noon.
I was standing in front
of 1 2 students for the entire hour.
I never left the room.
Anyone else have access
to your office?
Just the janitor. But you'd have
to ask Maintenance about that.
We will. We'll need to talk
to your students as well.
Look, Heather,
NTAC isn't the only organization
investigating the Nova Group.
There's gonna be a lot of people
looking at those phone records.
They're all gonna be less friendly
than we are.
Sorry, guys.
It's like I said. I was in class.
That's all I know.
I got a little worried about you
this afternoon.
You were gone all day again.
I was out walking.
I like to do that now.
Dad, I need you to talk to Shawn.
Tell him he can't break up with me.
It would be a mistake.
I can't do that.
For one thing, I don't think it is.
I know how much it must hurt
right now, but you'll get over it.
Don't talk to me like I'm a teenager.
There are things I have to do.
They're going to be really hard.
Dangerous.
And if Shawn's not with me,
it's gonna make things worse.
Worse for who? You?
No. Everyone else.
And what if he says no?
Be more convincing.
Heather. What's up?
I need to talk to you.
Listen, I've been thinking
all day about this.
I didn't tell you everything
this afternoon.
There was someone
who had the key to my office.
Okay, this person,
I need to know who it was.
Tom, it was Alana.
I didn't wanna say anything
in front of your partner.
I'm sure you understand why.
Tom, did Alana know
that you found out
where this guy Gary was living?
Yeah. Yeah, she did.
I was on the phone with her
when the tip came in. I told her.
She knew we'd been
chasing Gary for a long time.
Heather, come on, it wasn't Alana.
There has to be
some other explanation.
I hope so.
And I hope you find it.
But what do I do while you're looking?
You said it yourself, you're not the only
one with access to those records.
You're not the only one
who's gonna come asking questions.
You tell anyone who asks the
same thing you told me this afternoon.
Your alibi checks out.
Unless you say differently,
no one is gonna be able to prove you
lent that key to Alana or anyone else.
Heather, Alana didn't make that call.
If you just stick to your story for one
more day, this whole thing will be over.
What if I say no?
She comes after me? You?
I don't know.
I know she's determined
to get you back.
It's like she sees you
as her one connection to the world,
to people, to a normal life.
So, what you're saying
is it's like my job,
to keep her, I don't know, human?
It sounds that way, doesn't it?
Look, Shawn...
...I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
But I do know this.
Isabelle's not giving up.
Not without a fight.
And we've both seen what happens
when my daughter decides to fight.
Is everything all right, Thomas?
Don't think about it as informing.
You're helping us catch a criminal.
Now, I need you to tell me, who
did you lend Heather's office key to?
Sweetie, please. This is important.
Somebody compromised
our investigation.
I didn't give the key to anyone.
It was me, Thomas.
I called Gary Navarro.
I don't understand.
Are you a member of the Nova Group?
- No, of course not.
- Then why?
I trusted you.
I told you what we were doing
and you used it to betray me.
I wasn't betraying you. I did it for you.
How many times have I heard you say
that you felt responsible
for what happened to Gary Navarro?
He came to you for help
and instead the government used him
and turned him against his own kind.
I don't like what happened to Gary.
But he chose to become a terrorist.
He joined Nova of his own free will.
Gary wasn't with the Nova Group
anymore.
What?
How would you even know that?
A lot of people at the Center know it.
After the Nova Group
had T.J. Kim murdered,
he turned his back on them.
How can you even believe that?
Gary personally tried to murder
Dennis Ryland.
Ryland is responsible
for the death of 28 4400s.
Twenty-eight people that might
have changed the world for the better,
were they allowed to live.
He declared war on us.
I almost died, Thomas.
All Gary did was fight back.
You should have told me
what you were gonna do.
I wanted to.
But I couldn't.
You were bound by your job.
You couldn't give Gary
another chance.
So I did it for you.
And now you're gonna stand trial
right alongside of him.
You made that phone call
from the Center.
It's right there
on Gary's phone records.
They'll figure it out it was you, Alana.
So, what?
Am I supposed to lie for you now?
Am I supposed to become
Gary's accomplice too now?
I'm not asking you to do anything,
Thomas.
If you want to turn me in, fine.
But I believe I did the right thing.
And I hope the man I love
would believe it too.
Nikki, if I did pay off
your dad's hospital bill--
And I'm not admitting to anything.
--let's just say
that it's not that big of a deal, okay?
I'm glad to do something
with my money.
Giving up my social life to work
seven days a week at this place
has to have its perks, right?
I have a hard time believing
that you don't have a social life.
Running this place is a big job.
You know,
it kind of cuts you off from the world.
Well, I don't have $60,000.
But if you're feeling isolated,
you know, maybe I can
pay you back in another way.
There's a new sushi place
that opened in Belltown.
It's supposed to be pretty cool.
You like sushi now?
You're not the only one
who can change.
Just give me a second, okay?
Hey, Shawn.
Have you seen my copy
of The Republic in here?
No, you know what? I haven't seen it.
Hello again. I'm lsabelle.
Nikki. Nice to meet you.
I've heard of you.
Well, let me know if you find my book.
I'm right in the middle of it.
So tomorrow night?
You wanna check out
this new sushi place?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Tom, I'm so sorry.
Anything I can do to help?
I don't know.
I don't know what I can do.
I can't just turn Alana in.
If we do catch Gary,
eventually he's gonna give her up.
So, either way, her life is ruined.
Well, Tom, there's no way
you can try
and shake this agency off
Gary's scent.
You'll wind up a felon yourself.
I have to do something, Diana.
We're talking about Alana.
And one way or another, we've been
together for more than a decade.
I have to protect her.
Once I know she's safe,
then I can figure out how we move on.
If we move on.
You need to keep yourself safe too.
I think that the best thing
that we can do,
the only thing we can do...
...is to take ourselves off this case.
And do what?
Cross our fingers.
Hope Gary buys himself
a one-way ticket to Costa Rica.
What did you expect to happen?
I don't know.
But it's only for 36 hours, right?
- That's all they can hold her for.
- Honestly, I'm not sure.
They can hold her for as long
as it takes to investigate her alibi.
We're talking about
Dennis Ryland here.
You told me a dozen times,
he'll do whatever it takes
to get information.
He's going to interrogate her
and I don't know how far it's gonna go.
Alana, I'll call his office
in the morning.
I checked out
Heather's alibi myself.
I'll give them my notes.
It'll all go on the record.
Right now it's all I can do.
You know, I'm always happy
to talk to one of the 4400.
But I have to say,
I was surprised to find you
waiting outside my office this morning.
You can release Heather Tobey.
That phone call to Gary Navarro,
I was the one who made it.
Dennis, thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.
What were you thinking, Tom,
to get romantically involved
with a 4400?
What Alana did was misguided.
It was wrong.
But Gary wasn't part
of the Nova Group anymore.
Are you actually gonna stand here
and defend Gary Navarro to me?
The Nova Group isn't a bridge club.
You don't just leave.
Even if Gary tried to,
that doesn't absolve his other crimes,
which include attempted murder.
If the doctors had gotten to me
30 seconds later,
I would have been dead.
I know how badly
you want him, Dennis.
If it was up to me, Gary Navarro
would never even make it to trial.
Okay, forget about Gary.
Can we just concentrate on Alana?
Well, I'm afraid it's not possible
to make that distinction.
They're kind of intertwined,
aren't they, Tom?
Alana will be prosecuted like
any other member of the Nova Group.
She's not a member
of the Nova Group.
Dennis.
Dennis.
We've known each other
for 25 years.
You have to help me.
Like you helped me
when my back was to the wall?
Okay, I'm not a petty man, Tom.
I'll honor our relationship.
Thank you.
I appreciate anything you can do.
I'll tell NSA
you had nothing to do with this.
You may be a dupe,
but you're not a traitor.
And as for Alana,
the best chance of seeing mercy
is to cooperate fully
and help us find Gary Navarro.
Now you wanna catch
Gary Navarro?
Tom, we've already passed
the case off to Roth and Tierney.
We've got to get him before they do.
We've got to get him before
Ryland does. Before anyone.
Look, Ryland wants Gary.
It's a personal thing.
If we get can get Gary first,
we can deal with Ryland directly.
A straight-up trade. Gary for Alana.
So Ryland gets his hands on Gary
and it happens with no official record.
No arrest.
None of that sticky due process.
You really think
that Ryland's gonna agree to that?
If we dangle Gary in front of him?
In a heartbeat.
Look, Tom, l...
You saved my daughter's life.
I owe you everything for that
and I'll do what you want here.
But this is dangerous.
And it's a lot of trouble to go to for...
...a woman
who just betrayed you.
I owe her that much. More than that.
My son is incarcerated, Diana.
Alana's been right there with me
all the way through it.
And she doesn't deserve to rot in some
secret prison for the rest of her life.
Well,
any idea where we'd start?
Yeah.
Hey, Shawn.
Isabelle.
What are you doing in here?
I came by to talk.
I know you're still thinking about us,
but we're still friends, right?
I can still drop by.
Well, lsabelle, usually friends knock.
What's up?
I came to talk to you about Nikki.
I know you pretty well.
I don't think
she's the right girl for you.
Well, I don't know
why you think she's my girl.
You're entitled to your opinion,
though, I guess.
I'm just trying to protect you.
I just have this feeling
that if you guys get together...
...it's going to end badly.
Isabelle, what does that mean?
- Are you threatening Nikki now?
- Of course not.
Why would I threaten Nikki?
It's just, I have this feeling
that if you two hook up,
it's not going to end well.
Not for you.
Especially not for her.
It's always harder on the girl,
you know?
Hey.
Are you doing okay?
Yeah, more or less.
I want to help you, Alana.
I want to get you out of here.
- I don't think you can.
- I do.
I think there's a way,
but I need you to trust me.
I think you should cooperate
with Dennis Ryland.
Tell him whatever he wants to know.
I can't do that, Thomas.
That would be a betrayal.
Learn to live with it.
Listen to me, if you don't cooperate,
I don't think you're ever
gonna get out of here.
I can't.
Then I can't help you.
Thomas.
I was supposed to take the students
on a field trip to the aquarium
this afternoon.
I need you to go there
and leave them a note.
There's a bulletin board
outside the aquarium.
You should put it there
and it should say "field trip canceled."
Some of the kids will show up
with their parents.
When you see them,
give them my apologies.
I'll make sure they understand.
It was a code. At least I think it was.
She was telling me
how to get ahold of Gary.
Well, I don't know, Tom.
It's already been two hours.
Let's give it another 1 5 minutes.
Diana.
Gary, stop!
- Oh, my God.
- Get down, get down.
- Move along.
-Get down, get down, get down.
- Look out.
- Get out of the way.
Look out, look out.
Get out of the way.
- Hey.
- Go get the gun.
Come on.
Get the kids, get the kids.
Look out, get back.
- Go, move.
- Watch out, watch out.
Don't move, Gary. Don't move.
It's over, Gary.
Come on, get up.
So you're gonna turn me over
to Ryland.
You know
what he's gonna do to me, right?
Ryland is gonna interrogate me.
Yeah, you know all about that.
You've seen that firsthand.
And then he's going to
disappear me.
No trial. No record.
I'm not a mind reader, Gary.
Not like you.
I have no idea
what Ryland's gonna do with you.
That's how you get through this
hand-off with your conscience intact?
All right, you wanna know?
I'm trading you for Alana.
She helped you, now it's your chance
to help her. You owe her that much.
You made your own bed, Gary.
Nobody forced you to join Nova.
Nobody forced you to kill people.
I was a baseball player.
I was worried
about making the major leagues.
That's it.
If I hadn't met you two,
I'd be shagging grounders right now.
Okay, you should go.
If you still want to, that is.
But if you make this deal with Ryland,
it's forever.
I mean, we live with this.
I'll call you after the meet.
You're gonna have to
move him right away.
Seven-thirty, on the nose.
I gotta say, I'm impressed.
A big mogul like you,
figured that you'd keep a girl waiting.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You ready to go?
Nikki,
Iisten, we can't do this.
Do what? Dinner?
Shawn, it's not a big deal.
That's what people do at night.
You know this is about
more than just dinner.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to stand you up.
I just can't do this right now.
Shawn, I don't get it.
What happened?
Did some adviser tell you
that I don't fit in with your PR strategy?
No, nothing like that.
It's gonna sound like
a stupid guy thing.
Me leaving here right now
is the best thing I can do for you.
All right, then.
Go.
Bye.
So, Tom, I'm guessing
that if I don't agree
to this trade you're proposing,
you're not gonna drop Navarro off
at the nearest police station, are you?
You say no
and you can forget about
getting your hands on Gary Navarro.
I'll get him a passport,
a plane ticket.
He'll be in a Third World country
by this time tomorrow.
And if I decide to play along?
You want to know whether I'll be
asking questions about Gary Navarro
after you drive away with him?
No,
I won't be.
It's gonna be tricky to make
the charges against Alana go away.
You can do it, Dennis.
I have faith in you.
Let's go.
Listen, take this key ring.
The blue key
opens a safe-deposit box.
There are eight letters inside,
and I'd appreciate it if you'd mail them.
These letters,
who are they addressed to?
Eight families. All over the world.
Your NSA work.
Those are the families of the 4400s
that you helped target.
Right. I figure...
...it's time to let them know
what happened.
Give them a sense of closure.
Seems like the least I can do.
Seems like the only thing I can do,
actually.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I know it wasn't your idea.
Nice working with you again, Tom.
Well, that went well.
Tell me, why do I have
such a weird feeling in my stomach?
It's not easy
to sentence a man to death.
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Quiet back there.
It's all right. Let him pray.
Forgive us our trespasses as we...
Look out. Pull over.
Get out of the car. Get out.
Keep your hands
where I can see them. Up.
Keep your hands
where I can see them.
- Are you okay?
- Okay.
Tom, you need to think about this.
Tom, you're letting a terrorist
walk free.
No, I was a soldier.
You created me.
All I did was switch sides.
Well, guess what?
Now I'm done fighting.
- I'm walking away from the war.
- There is no walking away.
You've got numerous federal charges
hanging over your head,
including attempted murder.
Murderers walk free
all the time, Dennis.
Some of them even get cushy jobs
at Fortune 500 companies.
Very cute, Tom.
Have you thought about
what this means for your girlfriend?
Making her a fugitive is kind of
a funny way of showing your love.
I'd rather be on the run
than be responsible
for handing over a 4400 to you.
Skouris, you're supposed to be
the level-headed one.
Are you really gonna
throw your career away
because your partner
is on some personal crusade?
Oh, I don't see it that way, Dennis.
And if you want to hold on to your job,
you won't say anything about this.
A 4400 you personally signed out
of a military detention facility?
A secret trade in a remote location?
It's all kind of messy.
I'm guessing this one
stays off the books.
Let's go.
Nice working with you again, Dennis.
There's two lDs in there, and there's
enough cash to last you for a while.
The Canadian border's
about 30 miles away.
I'd-- I'd cross as soon as you can.
Ryland will be looking.
Yeah.
You know, it's been almost two years
since I've met you two.
And I remember that you said
that you would help me.
Well, it's been a long time coming,
but I guess you finally came through.
Thank you.
I didn't want us to end, Thomas.
Ever.
And especially not here, like this.
It doesn't have to end.
I can come with you.
You can't.
You need to be here.
You're one of the only good men
left in this fight.
I'll find a way to bring you back.
I promise.
over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted
all at once they were returned
with no memory of
where they've been
they haven't aged a day
and some have returned
with new abilities
all are trying to reconnect...
...with a life interrupted
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
I need you to talk to shawn.
Tell him he can't break up with me.
It would be a mistake.
Isabelle's not giving up,not without a fight.
I don't want this relationship to end...
so it's not going to.
I know I haven't always been there for you,kyle,
but I thought we had a pretty good relationship.
We do. It's just...
growing up with a dad who works for the fbi,ntac...
it can be pretty intense,you know?
You're supposed to say,"I wanted to."
Don't push your luck.
I told you what we were doing,and you used it to betray me.
Ryland is responsible for the death of 28 4400s,
28 people that might've changed the world for the better were they allowed to live.
Alana will be prosecuted like any other member of the nova group.
You're one of the only good men left in this fight.
I'll find a way to bring you back.I promise.
Hi,erika.
Stay away.
I'm not going to hurt you,erika.
I just want to talk.
That's what you always said.
That's how you used to get me up into your room.
I mean it now.
I swear.
This time I'm for real.
I'm not going to let you touch me!
It's okay.
Uncle patrick's here.
Tom baldwin?
I need your initial by the X.
What is it?
Sorry,man. Not a psychic.
"These are not dinner.Hang in there. Diana."
Baldwin.
Jarvis said this is a suicide.
Any idea why we got called?
Not really.
She said there's a D.E.A. Agent at the scene.
Apparently,he requested an ntac presence.
Hey,by the way,thanks for the cookies.
That was really thoughtful.
Cookies?
Yeah. The basket full of cookies.The ones you sent.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I didn't send you anything,tom.
In fact,I was going to thank you.
Thank me? For what?
I got a basket of cookies,too,maybe an hour ago,from you.
At least,that's what the card said.
I didn't send you anything either.
You two from ntac?
Yes.
Matt ruddy.
I'm with the D.E.A.
Come on in.
I guarantee you'll find this interesting.
Her name's erika lundgren.
She's our third suicide in the past two weeks.
Why is the D.E.A. Investigating suicides?
Because we think they're all connected.
For the past six weeks or so,
we've been hearing about a new recreational drug hitting the streets.
It's called "blink."
We got a small sample off a dealer we arrested.
But why call us? It's hardly our area of expertise.
We had the sample analyzed.
One of the components our laboratory guys isolated was like nothing he'd even seen before,
so they did some more checking.
It's similar to what they found in the 4400s.
What do you call it?Promicin?
What,so,this drug "blink,"you think a 4400 is synthesizing it?
That's why I called you guys.
If there's a 4400 involved in this,
I figure you could help track him down.
Absolutely.
It'd help if we knew more about this drug.
We don't know much about it,
except it seems to be a powerful hallucinogen.
Well,how do you know erika lundgren was on blink when she jumped?
Her roommate told us.
Erika took blink this morning.
Pretty soon after that,
she started telling me she was seeing her uncle.
She was really freaked out.
I mean,the guy's in some prison for 12 or more years.
Do you know where she got the drug?
When erika wanted to get high,
she'd go see this guy she went to school with.
I guess he deals now.
I mean,I don't know if that's where she got it from,
but his name's greg.
He usually hangs out in cowen park.
He always wears this old high school varsity jacket.
Erika said he used to be a track star or something.
Tony.
Take care of her.
Thank you.
We should probably head to cowen park,
find out where this guy greg gets his blink.
Hello,tommy.
Dad?
Hey,tommy,you're standing in the middle of the street.
Better be careful.
Tom?
Tom,what are you doing?
Come on.Off the road.
What's going on?
Diana,that D.E.A. Guy,
h-he said blink causes hallucinations,right?
Of course. Why?
Because I think I just saw my father.
He was right over there.
Tom,your father's been dead nine years.
Exactly.

Proudly Presents
It was the cookies.It had to be.
Tom,slow down.
Why would anyone want to slip you blink?
I don't know. Maybe it's some bitter 4400,someone who hates ntac.
Yeah,maybe,but I ate a cookie too.
I'm not seeing a dead relative.I feel fine.
Tom,you've been under a lot of stress lately.
All this talk of hallucinations--
your mind just decided to play tricks on you.
Yeah. Maybe.
Still,though,I think I should probably drive.
Well,what do you want to talk about?
Diana,do you see him?
See who?
My father. He's right there.
Tom,I don't see anything.
Nobody else can see me,pal.
I'm just here for you.
Just be quiet.You're not real.
Listen to me,tom.There's no one there.
Real or not real,I'm here,
and you're going to have to deal with me.
What do you want,dad?
It's not what I want.It's what you want.
You're the one who brought me here.
Must be something you want to say to me.
I've got nothing to say to you.
Tom,listen to me.There is no one back there.
You just have to try and calm down.
Yes,there is,diana.He's right--
he's gone.
He was right there,diana.I swear.
Tom,I'm going to take you into ntac medical,all right?
It's going to be fine.
That was nice.
See? It all still works between us.
I'm glad you came back.
Isabelle,not right now,okay?
I've got stuff I should do.
Let it wait.
Isabelle...
this time,if you want,
I could make you think I'm someone else.
Anyone you've ever had a fantasy about?
I can make the earth move for us.
Literally.
Isabelle,you don't need to use your abilities to tempt me.
Believe me,you're just fine on your own.
I've just got to go.
You never used to leave right after.
We've lost something,haven't we?
I mean,we still fit together and everything,
but it's not the same,is it?
No,it's not.
And we keep pretending everything's the same way it used to be.
I still keep pretending.
How's it working for you?
Not well.
I think I know what we need to do.
Good.
I'm glad you realize it too.
We have to get married.
It's the only way we can be sure we'll never lose each other.
Isabelle--
you go do your stuff.
I'll start thinking about a guest list.
Your cat scan came back fine,
but your blood pressure is still a little elevated.
Aside from that,your vitals are holding steady.
What about his labs?Any drugs in his system?
The toxscreen is negative,but that's not surprising,
because we don't know a lot about testing blink.
We've given you a mild sedative,
but that's all we can do for the moment.
So I can go home,right?
I haven't seen my dad in,what,six hours.
Well,typically,it takes about 48 hours for a psychotropic drug to leave your system.
We don't know much about blink.
So it's impossible to say how long the effects will last.
Or how severe they'll be.
Hallucinogens tend to affect everyone differently.
It depends what kind issues you're carrying in your subconscious.
All right,I'll have garrity give you both a ride home.
You two are taking a couple of days off.
I don't need a couple of days.I feel fine.
Yeah,but you ate the cookies,too.
And until we're sure the drugs are out of your system,
you're both on medical leave.
I spoke to your dad about our conversation.
We wanted to talk to you together.
I don't know if you're serious about this whole proposal thing,
but we need to nip it in the bud right now.
You and me getting married is not a good idea.
You're both too young,
and neither of you are ready for that kind of commitment.
I can't allow it.
I'm your father,
and I'm telling you this is not going to happen.
Your father speaks for both of us.
I'm not going along with this.
I get what the both of you are saying.
There are millions of reasons why we shouldn't get married.
There are just more reasons why we should.
Did either of you ever think that maybe this relationship was meant to happen?
That shawn and I were set up to meet,fall in love?
Isabelle,I don't love you.
Shawn,you and i are the two most powerful people on the planet.
We're supposed to be together.Who else is good enough for you?
Isabelle,the man just told you straight up--
he doesn't want to marry you.How much clearer does he have to be?
You have to accept that.
No.
I don'T.
Actually,you two need to change the way you're thinking.
Maybe it would help if you thought about it like an arranged marriage.
The future wants us to be together.
We're going to be together.
I'll make sure of it.
Are you sure you're going to be okay alone?
Because I can stay with you if you'd like.
No,I'm fine.
With any luck,that stuff's worn off already.
Well,call if you need anything.
I will.
Good night.
Good night.
Okay,garrity,you can take me home now.
Hey,diana.
Josh?
It's good to see you.
You look...different.
You look exactly the same.
What are you doing here?
There's some stuff that we need to talk about.
I don't think so.
I mean,we haven't spoken in,what,11 years?
I don't see any reason to change that.
That's a bit harsh,don't you think?
We've been through a lot together.
No,you put me through a lot.
There's a difference.
You all right?
It looked like you were just talking to yourself.
No. I'm not okay.
I think I got slipped a dose of blink,too.
Really.
Who'd you see?
No one.
Just some guy I used to know.
You were engaged?
Yeah. In grad school.
I had to take a physics course.
Josh sandler was the teaching assistant,
and we dated for three years.
I'm sorry. I know it's a lot to spring on you.
Yeah,well,you never said anything.
Well,it's not something I particularly like to talk T.
Uh,I don't want to sound jealous of a hallucination,
but...you must think about this guy a lot,huh?
Tom's seeing his dad.
You know,that makes sense.
Every kid's father is buried deep in their psyche.
Erika lundgren saw her uncle.
Who knows what kind of history they had.
Look,I can't answer for her,
but I can tell you that josh and i have plenty of our own history,
and most of it bad.
We had a fight about 10 days before the wedding,broke the engagement.
It was ugly.
Do you want to talk about it?
No.
The last thing I want to do is talk about josh sandler.
Listen,I'm exhausted,
and I just want to take a shower and get into bed.
Want some company?
No,not tonight.
I'll call you in the morning.
Okay.
You got the place to yourself now,huh?
A lot of room for one guy.
You know,now that alana's gone,
you ought to think about selling the place,
get some kind of an apartment.
Than for the suggestion,dad.
I like it fine here.
Still holding out for your son to come home,huh?
I've got to tell you,buddy,
I don't think that's going to happen.
Hey,don't get mad.
Trying to have a conversation here,
except you're not saying anything.
I wouldn't even know where to start.
Pick a topic.
Fine.Let's talk about when I was a kid.
I used to hate coming home when I knew you were going to be there.
You were nasty to mom.You drank.
You hated being a beat cop so much that you did everything you could to keep me out of law enforcement.
When I did get into the fbi,you never called.
Never said congratulations.
Too busy being jealous of your own damn kid.
Okay.I'm officially talking to myself now.
Feeling better?
Come on,tommy,you're a grownup.
I never figured you'd still be carrying so much anger toward me.
Being a father,you know how complicated it gets.
Look at you and kyle.The kid's in jail.
He won't even talk to you,let alone see you.
Kyle needs some time,and I'm giving it to him.
That's called respect.
I have always been there for him,good times and bad.
I didn't learn that from you.
I know I wasn't much of a father.
I tried to be there for you and susan.
Look for understanding someplace else.
In fact,why don't you do us both a favor and just go away?
That's not going to happen.
Fine. Then I will.
You can't just walk away,pal.
It ain't going to be that easy to get rid of me.
If you won't go away,I'll make you go away.
I'm going to find the 4400 who's doing this to me,and I'm going to force him to stop it.
You're going back on the case?
I'll come with you.
No,no.
I'm not working an investigation with my dead father.
I don't think you've got much of a choice,tom.
Either I come along for the ride...
or you and me go back inside and talk some more.
Fine.
Just don't show up when I'm in the middle of talking to somebody,okay?
No problem.
It's been a long time since I worked a case.
It's going to be fun.
You still make those late night bowls of ben & jerry's,huh?
Josh,I want you to go away.
Just stop showing up in my life.
You know,it's funny,
but you'd only make yourself ice cream after everybody else had gone to bed.
I used to wonder what that said about you.
You know,you're going to have to talk to me eventually.
No.
You see,you're a hallucination,
so I just have to make a conscious choice to ignore you,
and eventually,you'll be gone.
That's a good plan.
I just don't think it's going to work.
See,there's a reason I'm here,diana.There has to be.
You're random,just a mental hiccup.
Josh sandler isn't even dead.
I googled him tonight.
He teaches astronomy at pomona college.
So?That's the present-day josh sandler.
Your issues are with me,the guy you were engaged to.
I don't have any issues!
Mommy?
Are you okay?
I heard noises.
I'm fine,sweetie.
I'm just...practicing something for work.
Come on.
Let's get you to bed.
You were engaged?
Why does everyone have such a hard time believing that?
Well,it's not a hard time believing it.
Just... well,you never told me.
It was a long time ago.
It didn't work out.
Listen,I'm glad you called.
I don't like the idea of a drug in my system that caused three suicides.
These hallucinations we're having--
so far,it doesn't seem like the same thing erika lundgren went through.
All my dad wants to do is talk.
I know. Josh hasn't threatened me either.
As long as it stays that way,
there's no reason we can't use our "free time" to look into this case.
There's that delivery service.
If we can track down the source of those cookies,
maybe we can find the 4400 who's behind all of this.
And there's cowen park.
That dealer doesn't know anyone's looking for him.
I'll take the park,you take the delivery service.
Sounds good.
Anything but waiting around for my ex to show up...
devon,all of these messages are from this morning?
Yeah,well,everyone wants to congratulate you on your engagement.
Don't you want to start returning?
No,I don't want to talk to anyone.
Not even your mother?I have her on hold.
Yeah. Thank you,devon.
Mom. Hey.
No--
mom--
mom,who told you I got engaged?
No. I'm coming right over.
Mom,where are you?
A little mischievous one,wasn't he?
So cute.
Look at those eyes.
Look at that little butt!
Somebody tell me what's going on here?
If it isn't mr. Secretive.
I'm just showing your fiancee your baby pictures.
Consider it punishment for not making me the first phone call.
Come on,sit.
I'd love to,but isabelle and i have to actually get going.
We have a lot to talk about.
You bet we do.
My oldest boy is getting married,and I'm going to help plan the wedding.
I promise we won't make any decisions without you,
but isabelle,we need to go now.
Shawn,you're being rude.
I don't mean to be,but we really need to go.
Now.
It was really nice seeing you again.
You too.
I love your son very much.
We should probably be heading in the other direction.
Great. You're back.
We're going to covington,right?
You shouldn't backseat drive,josh.
You know,it was always one of your least flattering qualities.
Could you speak up a bit,ma'am?I didn't catch that.
I wasn't talking to you.
I was j--
sorry.
I don't mean to be annoying.
I'm sorry for everything,actually--
the way things worked out with us.
I-- I just had to say that out loud.
Apology not accepted.Do you mind just being quiet?
You know,I have to admit,
this is not how I pictured you at all.
I mean,working for the government,you're carrying a gun...
the whole thing with us,the wedding--
it really must have changed you.
As usual,josh,you're placing yourself at the center of everything.
Maybe I have changed,but it's got nothing to do with you.
In fact,until you showed up yesterday,
I hadn't even thought about you in...five years?
What?
It's just that your left eye still does that little twitching thing when you lie.
Yeah,I remember you.The gift basket.
Right.Well,there were cookies inside,
and we have reason to believe that they were laced with an illegal drug.
Hey,I don't know anything about that.
I just pick stuff up and deliver it.
Well,you delivered it to me.
Where'd you pick it up?
That's supposed to be confidential.
I guess it's okay this one time.
It was an old building downtown.
Here it is.156 liberty avenue.
Look at these people.
They don't even try to hide what they're doing.
I tell you,things have changed since I was walking the beat.
Yeah. I know.
You would have won the war on drugs singlehanded.
You've become a really angry guy,you know that?
I'm not trying to pick a fight here.
I know I'm not perfect.
You're not even alive.
All right,fair enough.
I wasn't perfect.
I blame most of that on the job.
You get burned out dealing with this crap.
Violence,ugliness...
it got inside my head.
I couldn't switch it off when I got home.
That's why I drank.
That's why I got nasty sometimes with you,your mother.
I'm not making excuses for myself.
You seem to need some kind of an explanation for what I did.
That's the best one I can give you.
Okay.
It's not anything I didn't already know,but...okay.
That dealer we're looking for?
Didn't you say he wears some kind of a high school varsity jacket?
Yeah. Why?
I don't know what you're so worked up about.
You won't find anything.
This wouldn't happen to be blink,would it?
So what if it is?
Blink's brand new,man.
Feds haven't even had time to make it illegal yet.
Yeah,we'll find time.
That's what we do when people start dying.
So who's supplying you with this?
You think I'd tell you that?
Baldwin.
Did jarvis say what this is about?
No,just that there'd been some break in the case.
These are the agents that were affected?
This is tom baldwin,diana skouris.
They were compromised yesterday.
I am so sorry about all of this.
You were drugged against your will,
and those young people committing suicide--
it's all so terrible.
Uh,ma'am,who are you?
My name is naomi bonderman.
It's my ability that did this to you.
I caused all of this.
one day about 3 months ago
I woke up with what I thought were sweaty palms.
Then I realized it wasn't sweat.
It was some kind of...
oil,I suppose you'd call it.
And that's when I first saw my sister.
This sister of yours,you hadn't seen her for a while?
Ruth's been dead for 30 years.
And there she was,standing at the foot of my bed.
We were never close.
But once I realized I hadn't gone completely batty,
we had a very nice visit.
Finally,after all these years,
we worked things out between us.
In the morning,she was gone.
And then I touched gordon's hand.
Gordon?Is that your husband?
No,my mailman.
And that night,he was visited by some army buddy of his who was wounded in the first gulf war.
That's when I started wearing my gloves.
Mrs. Bonderman,have you any idea how your ability came to be sold on the streets?
At first,I had no idea,
but now,I think it had something to do with my fried chicken.
I use a lot of herbs in my cooking.
I grow them myself.
That's the only place I don't wear my gloves,
when I'm working in the garden.
And the herbs absorbed the oil from your hands.
My family had come over for sunday dinner,
and that night,they all started having their own encounters.
It was very emotional for everyone,
but it all seemed to work out for the best.
No one died or anything.
Could someone have gotten ahold of these herbs,
used them to make this drug?
Well,that must have been what happened.
The tuesday after the dinner,I went out to water,
and all of my plants were gone.
Pulled out.
Someone stole the herbs from your garden...
someone who knew the effect they could have.
I had hoped one day my ability might be used as a kind of therapy,to help people,
but now it's being sold on the street and people are dying.
It's just horrible.
Mrs. Bonderman,have you any sense of how long these visions usually last?
Sometimes the visitors stay for days,weeks,even.
I know one thing,though.
The more you ignore them,the longer they stay and the more insistent they become.
I know we're officially on medical leave,
but I thought I might check out that address we got from the delivery company,
try and find who sent the cookies.
You want to come along?
Actually,I was going to stop by mrs. Bonderman's house,
go over the guest list from that dinner one more time.
She seemed a little vague about who was there.
You think one of them might've gone into business with grandma's recipe?
It's a place to start.
Isabelle,this has to stop.
You can't force me to marry you.
You've got cold feet.
I've read about this.
No,it's not cold feet.
I want you to understand this not going to happen.
I'm not going to marry you,
and if you can't accept that,
if you want to hurt me for rejecting you,
you go ahead and do it.
I'm right here.
Let's get it over with.
I would never hurt you,shawn.
That's good to hear.
Okay,we're clear,right?
It's over between the two of us?
You told me once that good and evil was a choice,
one you get to make.
Well,right now,I'm at a place where I have to make that choice,
and I'm afraid if I lose you,I'm going to make the wrong one.
Who will you threaten this time? My mom?
Shawn,I'm not threatening anyone.
I'm asking for your help.
My help?
There are things I was sent here to do,brutal things.
Your mother and millions of other people could die because of me.
I don't know how you could know that,
but it doesn't have to happen that way.
You can fight it.
That's what I'm trying to do.
That's why you and me,we need to be together,
because I think you're the only one who can stop me.
Are you sure this is the place?
Yeah. I stood right here.
Guy came out from the back,handed me the cookies,that was it.
The management company said this office has been vacant for eight months.
You said these guys are drug dealers,right?
I mean,maybe they move around a lot.
Maybe they operate out of a whole bunch of different places.
And the man who gave you the cookies,
you don't remember anything about him?
I wasn't really paying attention.If I saw him again,maybe.
Look,since no one's here,can I go?
I've got to get back to work.
Yeah,sure.
Thanks for trying.
Call me if something comes to you.
Sure.
Is that a clue?
I'm trying to work here.
You know what,this isn't fun for me either.
I've got my job,too.
There must be something you want to say to me,talk about old times--
old times?
You cheated on me,two weeks before the wedding.
Who does something like that?
I figured you'd still be still mad about that.
It took me forever to get over what you did.
The hurt,the betrayal--but I did it.
I put you behind me,I moved on,
I'm not interested in a single thing you have to say.
Josh?
Are we done?
Anybody could get over that fence.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Remember when you were a kid,you used to help me mow the lawn?
I remember you yelling at me for missing spots.
I wanted you to do a good job,
take pride in your work,be a man.
Yeah,well,it worked.
No matter what the situation,
I just think about what you would do,and I do the opposite.
Never failed.
That's my tommy.He's got all the answers,huh?
When it comes to you,I do.
All right,then,answer me this.
The last time I went in the hospital,
the time I didn't make it out,
why didn't you come see me?
It's a simple question,tom.
Agent baldwin?
Would you like some iced tea?
Let's see,there were barry,kathleen,and the twins--
oh,they cried all through dinner--
philip and his new girlfriend.
I'm afraid I don't remember her name.
Uh,roger and julie.
I'm sorry,julie was sick that day.
A sinus headache.She gets them all the time.
That's my grandson,randy.
He works for door-to-door delivery?
He's still finding himself.
Does he know about your ability?
Oh,of course he does.
He was here at that dinner.
He had two helpings of chicken.
Neighbor says randy left a few hours ago.
No idea where he went.
We know he's not at work.
I'll check the bedroom,see if I can find an address book.
Don't you guys ever stop for lunch?
I thought I'd gotten rid of you.
No,no,we still have some ground to cover.
You know that thing that you said about how you moved on,
that you put me behind you?
I'm not really sure I'm buying it.
I don't care.
Well,maybe not.
But if you're so over me,
how come you haven't had a single serious relationship since we broke up?
I have had plenty of serious relationships,
ones that were a lot more respectful and successful than the one I had with you.
You want to name one?
What do you call marco?
I'd call him a very sweet guy who would do anything for you.
You could learn something from him.
Still,it's a relationship with no future,and you know it.
That's why you're with him.
I have no idea what kind of future I've got with marco.
We haven't been going out that long.
You'll go out for a couple of months,
and then when he pushes you for a commitment,
you'll finally tell him the truth,
that there isn't any chemistry,
that you're really not right for each other--
all things you already know.
Is that really the way I treat the guys I date?
Di...
you're an amazing woman,and I blew it.
What I did to you was cruel,
but you can't keep protecting yourself forever.
It's not fair to you,and it's not fair to marco.
Offhand,I'd say somebody's been doing some baking.
Yeah,but where did all of the cookies go?
Look,buddy,I know you're busy,but you never answered my question.
Why didn't you come see me when I was dying?
Dad,I really can't talk about this now.
Hey,it's not my favorite memory either.
So let's get it over and done with.
Then I'll leave you alone.
You mean if I tell you,that's it?
We're done,you're gone?
It would be a step in the right direction.
I was in baltimore,working on a case for the bureau.
When I got the call from mom,I booked a flight home.
I was all set to go,but then the case heated up and I missed my plane.
By the time I could get another one,it was too late.
I asked you for the truth,tommy.
You're just giving me excuses.
You want the truth?
I stayed away as a favor to you.
You didn't want me there,dad.
Whatever I'd say,whatever I'd do,
it would only piss you off,like always.
I figured my not being there would make it easier for you.
I let you die in peace.
I wanted to see you one last time.
You're my son,tommy.I love you.
Well,that's nice to hear,but it's a little too late.
I know.
That was my fault.I'm sorry.
But I did want you there,tommy.
You were wrong about me,about how I felt.
Maybe you're wrong about some other things.
I hope you're going to show me a kitchen filled with cookies.
I wish.
I think he took them with him.
Better take a look at that.I found it wedged behind the dresser.
It's like he kept a record of everyone he dosed.
You think it's some kind of enemies list?He's trying to get back at all these people?
Diana...
that's the food fair.It starts today.
Now we know where he took the cookies.
Tom...
stop!
Get up.
Where are the rest of the cookies?
There aren't any more,I swear.
He just opened the box.Looks like we made it just in time.
Nice work,you two.
Ntac medical will be busy for some time.
Yeah,we'll keep them under observation,get them counseling.
I take it you both have been too busy ignoring your medical leave to deal with your own situations.
We figured first things first.
Yeah,if my dad showed up,I'd be spending a lot of time at work,too.
But now,I want you both to go home and deal with this thing.
If you feel you can't,
we'll book you adjoining suites at ntac medical.
Okay?
I just want you to know I never meant to hurt anyone.
Well,tell that to erika lundgren and the others who died.
I'm really sorry about that.
Honestly.
But all I did was give them a chance to deal with their problems,
you know,face to face.
I just wanted to share the enlightenment.
I guess they couldn't handle it.
Well,I don't get the connection.Why send the cookies to us?
What are you talking about?
You guys exposed the promicin scandal.
You saved my grandmother's life.
It was a gift,my way of saying thank you.
"Thank you"?
I guess no good deed ever goes unpunished,huh?
All this stuff isabelle told you,
you sure she wasn't making it up,scaring you,trying to keep you close?
Because I'm telling you,shawn,
this sounds crazy.
I can heal people.You can move things with your mind.
We live in a crazy world.
When she was a baby,
even younger,when she was in her mother's womb,
I knew she was different,dangerous.
Richard,if I believed that staying with isabelle would save all those lives,
I would marry her tomorrow.
But what happens a month from now,or a year?
What happens if she gets tired of me or I make her angry?
I get it. Marrying her is not the answer.
We've got to find another way to stop her.
She's my daughter,shawn.
What would you have me do?
Hey,I was out with some of the guys.
I came right over as soon as I got your voicemail.
You okay?
I picked up some italian on the way here.
Don't be nice to me.
Uh,I don't like the sound of that.
I know this isn't pleasant,but you're doing the right thing.
Does this mean we can say goodbye?
As a matter of fact,it does.
Try not to miss me,di.
I won'T.
Goodbye? You mean you're leaving?
All I've been doing is making you miserable.
I figure I did enough of that when you were a kid growing up.
Yeah,we're done here.
We've made about as much progress as we can make,huh?
You take care.
I'd shake your hand,but it doesn't work that way.
Dad?
You know what I said before about my missing that flight home as a favor to you?
That wasn't true.
I never thought it was.
I did it for me.
It was just the idea of standing around that hospital room,watching you die...
with all of that anger still between us,
knowing that we'd never work it out,
that we'D...
we'd never be as close as I wanted us to be.I couldn't do it.
It's okay,tommy. I...
I didn't deserve to have you there.
I should've been there anyway.I'm sorry.
The clock just ran out on us,huh?
Well,I guess there's no clock now,is there?
I've got all the time in the world,
not that we have to use it.
Why don't you come and sit down?
Tommy,we don't have to do this.
I know.Why don't you,uh...
why don't you just come back in the kitchen and park it,okay?
I never liked eating alone.
Nothing worse.
So...what do you want to talk about?
Happy now?
You tried.
It didn't work.
You can't kill me,shawn.
I guess we're going to get married after all.

Proudly Presents
We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
I need you to talk to Shawn.
Tell him he can't break up with me.
It would be a mistake.
Isabelle's not giving up,
not without a fight.
I don't want this relationship to end,
so it's not going to.
I know I haven't always been there
for you, Kyle,
but I thought
we had a pretty good relationship.
We do. It's just, you know,
growing up with a dad
who works for the FBl, NTAC,
it can be pretty intense, you know?
You're supposed to say,
"l wanted to."
Don't push your luck.
I told you what we were doing
and you used it to betray me.
Ryland is responsible
for the death of 28 4400s.
TWenty-eight people that might
have changed the World for the better,
Were they alloWed to live,
Alana Will be prosecuted like any
other member of the NO VA Group,
You're one of the only good men
left in this fight.
I'll find a way to bring you back.
I promise.
Hi, Erika.
- Stay away.
- I'm not gonna hurt you, Erika.
I just want to talk.
I know. That's what you always said.
That's how you used to get me
up into your room.
I mean it now. I swear.
This time I'm for real.
I'm not gonna let you touch me!
It's okay.
Uncle Patrick's here.
Tom Baldwin?
Need your initial by the X.
- What is it?
- Sorry, man. Not a psychic.
"These are not dinner.
Hang in there. Diana."
Baldwin.
Jarvis said this is a suicide.
Any idea why we got called?
Not really. She said
there's a DEA agent at the scene.
Apparently,
he requested an NTAC presence.
Hey, by the way,
thanks for the cookies. That was...
- That was really thoughtful.
- Cookies?
Yeah. The basket full of cookies.
The ones you sent.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I didn't send you anything, Tom.
In fact, I was gonna thank you.
Thank me? For what?
I got a basket of cookies too,
maybe an hour ago. From you.
At least that's what the card said.
I didn't send you anything either.
- You two from NTAC?
- Yes.
Matt Ruddy.
I'm with the DEA. Come on in.
I guarantee
you're gonna find this interesting.
Her name's Erika Lundgren.
She's our third suicide
in the past two weeks.
Why is the DEA
investigating suicides?
Because we think
they're all connected.
For the past six weeks or so,
we've been hearing
about a new recreational drug
hitting the streets.
It's called Blink.
We got a small sample
off the dealer we arrested.
But why call us?
It's hardly our area of expertise.
We had the sample analyzed.
One of the components
our laboratory guys isolated
was like nothing we've seen before.
So they did some more checking.
It's similar to what they found
in the 4400s.
What do you call it? Promicin?
What, so this drug Blink,
you think a 4400 is synthesizing it?
That's why I called you guys.
If there's a 4400 involved in this,
I figure you could help
track him down.
Absolutely. It'd help if we knew more
about this drug.
We don't know much about it,
except it seems to be
a powerful hallucinogen.
How do you know Erika Lundgren
was on Blink when she jumped?
Her roommate told us.
Erika took Blink this morning.
Pretty soon after that, she started
telling me she was seeing her uncle.
She was really freaked out.
I mean, the guy's in some prison
for 1 2 more years.
Do you know
where she got the drug?
When Erika wanted to get high,
she'd go see this guy
she went to school with.
I guess he deals now.
I mean, I don't know
if that's where she got it from,
but his name's Greg.
He usually hangs out
in Cowen Park.
He always wears
this old high school varsity jacket.
Erika said he used to be a track star
or something.
Tony, take care of her.
Thank you.
We should probably
head to Cowen Park.
Find out where this guy Greg
gets his Blink.
Hello, Tommy.
Dad?
Hey, Tommy, you're standing
in the middle of the street.
- Better be careful.
- Tom.
Tom, what are you doing?
Come on. What's going on?
Diana, that DEA guy, he said Blink
causes hallucinations, right?
Of course. Why?
Because I think I just saw my father.
He was right over there.
Tom, your father's been dead
nine years.
Exactly.
- It was the cookies. It had to be.
- Tom, slow down.
Why would anyone
wanna slip you Blink?
I don't know. Maybe some bitter 4400.
Someone who hates NTAC.
Yeah, maybe.
But I had a cookie too,
and I'm not seeing a dead relative.
I feel fine.
Listen, Tom,
you've been under a lot of stress lately.
I mean, all this talk of hallucinations,
your mind has decided
to play tricks on you.
Yeah, maybe.
Still though,
I think I should probably drive.
Well, what do you wanna
talk about?
- Diana, do you see him?
- See who?
- My father. He's right there.
- Tom, I don't see anything.
Nobody else can see me, pal.
I'm just here for you.
Just be quiet. You're not real.
Listen to me, Tom.
There's no one there.
Real or not real, I'm here.
And you're gonna have
to deal with me.
What do you want, Dad?
It's not what I want,
it's what you want.
You're the one
who brought me here.
There must be something
you wanna say to me.
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Tom, listen to me.
There is no one back there. You're
gonna have to try and calm down.
Yes, there is, Diana. He's right--
He's gone.
He was right there, Diana. I swear.
Tom, I'm gonna take you
to NTAC Medical, all right?
It's gonna be fine.
That was nice.
See? It all still works between us.
I'm glad you came back.
Isabelle. Hey, not right now, okay?
- I've got stuff I should do.
- Let it wait.
Isabelle.
This time, if you want,
I could make you think
I'm someone else.
Anyone you've ever had
a fantasy about.
I can make the earth move for us.
Literally.
Isabelle, you don't need
to use your abilities to tempt me.
Believe me,
you're just fine on your own.
- I just gotta go.
- You never used to leave right after.
We've lost something, haven't we?
I mean, we still fit together
and everything,
but it's not the same, is it?
No, it's not.
And we keep pretending everything's
the same way it used to be.
Well, I still keep pretending.
How is it working for you?
Not well.
I think I know what we need to do.
Good. I'm glad you realize it too.
We have to get married.
It's the only way we can be sure
we'll never lose each other.
Isabelle.
You go do your stuff,
I'll start thinking about a guest list.
Your CAT scan came back fine.
but your blood pressure's
still a little elevated.
Aside from that,
your vitals are holding steady.
What about his labs?
Any drugs in his system?
The tox screen was negative,
but that's not surprising
because we don't know a lot
about testing Blink.
We've given you a mild sedative,
but that's all we can do
for the moment.
So I can go home, right?
I haven't seen my dad in,
what, six hours.
Well, typically it takes
about 48 hours
for a psychotropic drug
to leave your system.
We don't know much about Blink.
Well, so it's impossible to say
how long the effects will last.
Or how severe they'll be.
Hallucinogens tend to affect everyone
differently.
It depends what kind of issues
you're carrying in your subconscious.
All right, I am gonna have
Garrity give you both a ride home.
- You two are taking a couple days off.
- I don't need a couple days. I feel fine.
But you ate the cookies too.
Until we're sure the drugs
are out of your system,
you're both on medical leave.
I spoke to your dad
about our conversation.
We wanted to talk to you together.
I don't know if you're serious
about this whole proposal thing,
but we need to nip it in the bud
right now.
You and me getting married
is not a good idea.
You're both too young.
Neither of you are ready for that kind
of commitment. I can't allow it.
I'm your father and I'm telling you,
it's not gonna happen.
Your father speaks for both of us.
I'm not going along with this.
I get what the both of you
are saying.
There are millions of reasons
why we shouldn't get married.
There are just more reasons
why we should.
Did either of you ever think
that maybe this relationship
was meant to happen?
That Shawn and I were set up
to meet?
Fall in love?
- lsabelle, I don't love you.
- Shawn, you and l
are the two most powerful people
on the planet.
We're supposed to be together.
Who else is good enough for you?
Isabelle, the man just told you straight
up, he doesn't wanna marry you.
How much clearer
does he have to be?
- You have to accept that.
- No.
I don't.
Actually, you two need to change
the way you're thinking.
Maybe it would help
if you thought about it
Iike an arranged marriage.
The future wants us to be together.
We're gonna be together.
I'll make sure of it.
Are you sure
you're going to be okay alone?
I mean, I could stay with you
if you want.
No, I'm fine.
With any luck,
that stuff's worn off already.
Well, call if you need anything.
- I will. Good night.
- Good night.
Okay, Garrity.
You can take me home now.
Hey, Diana.
- Josh?
- It's good to see you.
You look different.
You look exactly the same.
What are you doing here?
There's some stuff
that we need to talk about.
I don't think so.
I mean, we haven't spoken
in, what, 1 1 years?
I don't see any reason
to change that.
That's a bit harsh, don't you think?
We've been through a lot together.
No. You put me through a lot.
There's a difference.
Hey, are you all right?
It looked like
you were just talking to yourself.
No, I'm not okay.
I think I got slipped a dose
of Blink too.
Really? Now, who'd you see?
No one.
Just some guy I used to know.
- You were engaged?
- Yeah, in grad school.
I had to take a physics course.
Josh Sandler was a teaching assistant,
and we dated for three years.
I'm sorry.
I know it's a lot to spring on you.
You never said anything.
Well, it's not something
I particularly like to talk about.
I don't wanna sound jealous
of a hallucination,
but you must think
about this guy a lot, huh?
Tom's seeing his dad, you know,
that makes sense.
Every kid's father
is buried deep in their psyche.
Erika Lundgren saw her uncle.
Who knows
what kind of history they had.
Look. I can't answer for her.
But I can tell you that Josh and l
have plenty of our own history,
and most of it bad.
We had a fight about 1 0 days
before the wedding,
broke the engagement.
It was ugly.
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- No.
The last thing I wanna do
is talk about Josh Sandler.
Listen, I'm exhausted
and I just wanna take a shower
and get into bed.
Want some company?
No, not tonight.
I'll call you in the morning.
Okay.
You got the place
to yourself now, huh?
Lot of room for one guy.
You know, now that Alana's gone,
you ought to think
about selling the place.
Get some kind of apartment.
Thanks for the suggestion, Dad.
I like it fine here.
You're still holding out for your son
to come home.
I gotta tell you, buddy,
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Hey, don't get mad.
I'm trying to have a conversation here.
Except you're not saying anything.
I wouldn't even know where to start.
Pick a topic.
Fine. Let's talk
about when I was a kid.
I used to hate coming home
when I knew you were gonna be there.
You were nasty to Mom. You drank.
You hated being a beat cop so much,
you did everything you could
to keep me out of law enforcement.
When I did get into the FBl,
you never called,
you never said congratulations.
You were too busy being jealous
of your own damn kid.
Okay, I'm officially talking
to myself now.
You feeling better?
Come on, Tommy.
You're a grownup.
I never figured you'd still be carrying
so much anger, Tom.
Being a father...
You know how complicated it gets.
Look at you and Kyle.
The kid's in jail. He won't even
talk to you, let alone see you.
Kyle needs some time,
and I'm giving it to him.
That's called respect.
I have always been there for him.
Good times and bad.
- I didn't learn that from you.
- I know I wasn't much of a father.
I tried to be there
for you and Susan.
Look for understanding
someplace else.
In fact, why don't you
do us both a favor and just go away?
- That's not gonna happen.
- Fine. Then I will.
You can't just walk away, pal.
It ain't gonna be that easy
to get rid of me.
You won't go away?
I'll make you go away.
I'm gonna find the 4400
who's doing this to me.
- I'm gonna force him to stop it.
- You're going back on the case?
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, no.
I'm not working an investigation
with my dead father.
I don't think you got much
of a choice, Tom.
Either I come along for the ride,
or you and me go back inside
and talk some more.
Fine.
Just don't show up
when I'm in the middle
of talking to somebody, okay?
No problem.
Been a long time
since I've worked a case.
This is gonna be fun.
You still make those late-night bowls
of Ben & Jerry's, huh?
Josh, I want you to go away.
Just stop showing up in my life.
You know, it's funny.
But you'd only
make yourself ice cream
after everybody else
had gone to bed.
I used to wonder
what that said about you.
You know, you're gonna
have to talk to me eventually.
No. You see, you're a hallucination.
So I just have to make
a conscious choice to ignore you
and eventually you'll be gone.
It's a good plan.
I just don't think it's gonna work.
See, there's a reason I'm here, Diana.
There has to be.
You're random.
Just a mental hiccup.
Josh Sandler isn't even dead.
I Googled him tonight.
He teaches astronomy
at Pomona College.
So? That's the present-day
Josh Sandler.
Your issues are with me,
the guy you were engaged to.
I don't have any issues!
Mommy? Are you okay?
I heard noises.
I'm fine, sweetie.
I'm just practicing something for work.
Come on. Let's get you to bed.
You Were engaged?
Why does everyone
have such a hard time believing that?
It's not a hard time believing it,
it just-- Well, you never told me.
It was a long time ago.
It didn't work out.
Listen, I'm glad you called.
I don't like the idea
of a drug in my system
that caused three suicides.
And these hallucinations
we're having,
so far, it doesn't seem
like the same thing
Erika Lundgren went through.
- All my dad wants to do is talk.
- I know.
Josh hasn't threatened me either.
As long as it stays that way,
there's no reason
we can't use our free time
to look into this case.
There's that delivery service.
If we track down the source
of those cookies,
maybe we could find the 4400
who's behind this.
And there's Cowen Park. That dealer
doesn't know anyone's looking for him.
I'll take the park,
you take the delivery service.
Sounds good.
Anything but waiting around
for my ex to show up.
Devon, all of these messages
are from this morning.
Well, everyone wants to congratulate
you on your engagement.
- Do you wanna start returning?
- No. I don't wanna talk to anyone.
Not even your mother?
I have her on hold.
Yeah. Thank you, Devon.
Mom, hey.
No-- Mom.
Mom, who told you I got engaged?
No, I'm coming right over.
Mom, where are you?
- A little mischievous one, wasn't he?
- I love that little old face. It's so cute.
Look at those eyes.
Look at that little butt.
So somebody tell me
what's going on here.
If it isn't Mr. Secretive.
I'm just showing your fiancée
your baby pictures.
Consider it punishment
for not making me the first phone call.
Come on, sit.
I'd love to, but lsabelle and l
have to actually get going.
- We have a lot to talk about.
- You bet we do.
My oldest boy is getting married
and I'm gonna help plan the wedding.
I promise we won't make any decisions
without you.
- But, lsabelle, we need to go now.
- You're being rude.
I don't mean to be,
but we really need to go. Now.
- It was really nice seeing you again.
- You too.
I love your son very much.
We should probably be heading
in the other direction.
Great. You're back.
- We're going to Covington, right?
- You shouldn't back-seat drive, Josh.
You know, it was always
one of your least flattering qualities.
Could you speak up a bit, ma'am?
I didn't catch that.
I wasn't talking to you. I was just--
Sorry. I don't mean to be annoying.
I'm sorry for everything, actually.
The way things worked out with us.
I just had to say that out loud.
Apology not accepted.
Do you mind just being quiet?
You know, I have to admit,
this is not how I pictured you at all.
I mean, working for the government.
You're carrying a gun.
The whole thing with us, the wedding,
it really must have changed you.
As usual, Josh, you're placing yourself
at the center of everything.
Maybe I have changed.
But it's got nothing to do with you.
In fact,
until you showed up yesterday,
I mean, I hadn't thought about you
in five years.
What?
It's just that your left eye still does
that little twitching thing when you lie.
Yeah, I remember you.
The gift basket.
Right. Well, there were cookies inside,
and we have reason to believe
that they were laced
with an illegal drug.
Hey, I don't know anything about that.
I just pick stuff up and deliver.
Well, you delivered it to me.
- Where did you pick it up?
- That's supposed to be confidential.
I guess it's okay this one time.
It was an old building downtown.
Here it is. 1 56 Liberty Avenue.
Look at these people.
They don't even try to hide
what they're doing.
I tell you, things have changed
since I was walking the beat.
Yeah, I know. You'd have won the war
on drugs single-handed.
You've become a really angry guy,
you know that?
I'm not trying to pick a fight here.
- I know I'm not perfect.
- You're not even alive.
All right, fair enough.
I wasn't perfect.
I blame most of that on the job.
You get burned out
dealing with this crap.
Violence, ugliness.
It got inside my head.
I couldn't switch it off
when I got home.
That's why I drank.
It's why I got nasty sometimes
with you and your mother.
I'm not making excuses for myself.
I mean-- You seem to need some kind
of an explanation for what I did.
That's the best one I can give you.
Okay.
It's not anything
I didn't already know, but...
Okay.
That dealer we're looking for,
did you say he wears some kind
of a high school varsity jacket?
Yeah, why?
I don't know
what you're so worked up about.
You won't find anything.
This wouldn't happen to be Blink,
would it?
And so what if it is?
Blink's brand-new, man.
Feds haven't even had time
to make it illegal yet.
Yeah, well, we'll find time.
That's what we do
when people start dying.
- So who's supplying you with this?
- You think I'd tell you that?
Baldwin.
Did Jarvis say what this is about?
No. Just that there'd been
some break in the case.
These are the agents
that were affected?
This is Tom Baldwin, Diana Skouris.
They were compromised yesterday.
Oh, I am so sorry about all this.
You were drugged against your will.
And those young people
committing suicide...
It's all so terrible.
Ma'am, who are you?
My name is Naomi Bonderman.
It's my ability that did this to you.
I caused all this.
One day, about three months ago,
I woke up with what I thought
were sweaty palms.
Then I realized it wasn't sweat.
It was some kind of oil,
I suppose you'd call it.
And that's when I first saw
my sister.
This sister of yours,
you hadn't seen her for a while?
Ruth's been dead for 30 years.
And there she was,
standing at the foot of my bed.
We were never close.
But once I realized
I hadn't gone completely batty,
we had a very nice visit.
Finally, after all these years,
we worked things out between us.
In the morning, she was gone.
And then I touched Gordon's hand.
Gordon? Is that your husband?
No, my mailman.
And that night, he was visited
by some Army buddy of his
who was wounded
in the first Gulf War.
That's when I started
wearing my gloves.
Mrs. Bonderman, have you any idea
how your ability came to be sold
on the streets?
At first I had no idea.
But now, I think it had something to do
with my fried chicken.
I use a lot of herbs in my cooking.
I grow them myself.
That's the only place
I don't wear my gloves,
when I'm working in the garden.
And the herbs absorbed the oil
from your hands.
My family had come over
for Sunday dinner.
And that night, they all started
having their own encounters.
It was very emotional for everyone.
But it all seemed to work out
for the best.
No one died or anything.
Could someone have gotten ahold
of these herbs,
used them to make this drug?
That must have been
what happened.
The Tuesday after the dinner,
I went out to water,
and all of my plants were gone.
Pulled out.
Someone stole the herbs
from your garden,
someone who knew the effect
they could have.
I had hoped one day
my ability might be used
as a kind of therapy to help people.
But now it's being sold on the street
and people are dying.
It's just horrible.
Mrs. Bonderman, have you any sense
of how long these visions usually last?
Sometimes the visitors stay for days,
weeks even.
I know one thing, though.
The more you ignore them,
the longer they stay,
and the more insistent they become.
I know
we're officially on medical leave,
but I thought I might check out
that address
we got from the delivery company.
Try and find out who sent the cookies.
You wanna come along?
I was gonna stop by
Mrs. Bonderman's house,
go over the guest list
from that dinner.
She seemed a little vague
about who was there.
Think one of them might have gone
into business with Grandma's recipe?
That's a place to start.
Isabelle, this has to stop.
You can't force me to marry you.
- You've got cold feet. I read about this.
- No. It's not cold feet.
I want you to understand
this is not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna marry you.
And if you can't accept that,
if you wanna hurt me for rejecting you,
you go ahead and do it.
I'm right here. Let's get it over with.
I would never hurt you, Shawn.
That's good to hear.
Okay, we're clear, right?
It's over between the two of us.
You once told me
that good and evil was a choice.
One you get to make.
Well, right now, I'm at a place
where I have to make that choice.
And I'm afraid if I lose you,
I'm going to make the wrong one.
Who are you gonna threaten this time?
My mom?
Shawn, I'm not threatening anyone.
- I'm asking for your help.
- My help?
There are things I was sent here to do.
Brutal things.
Your mother
and millions of other people
could die because of me.
I don't know how you could know that,
but it doesn't have to happen that way.
- You can fight it.
- That's what I'm trying to do.
That's why you and me,
we need to be together.
Because I think you're the only one
who can stop me.
You sure this is the place?
Yeah. Stood right here, guy came out
from the back, handed me the cookies.
That was it.
The management company said
that this office has been vacant
for eight months.
You said these guys are drug dealers,
right?
I mean,
maybe they move around a lot.
Maybe they operate out
of a whole bunch of different places.
The man who gave you the cookies,
you don't remember anything
about him?
I wasn't really paying attention.
If I saw him again, maybe.
Look, since no one's here, can I go?
I gotta get back to work.
Yeah, sure. Thanks for trying.
Call me if something comes to you.
Sure.
Is that a clue?
I'm trying to work here.
You know what?
This isn't fun for me either.
I've got my job too.
There must be something
that you wanna say to me.
- What, you wanna talk about old times?
- Old times?
You cheated on me two weeks
before the wedding.
- Who does something like that?
- Figured you'd still be mad about that.
Oh, it took me forever
to get over what you did.
The hurt, the betrayal. But I did it.
I put you behind me.
I moved on. And I'm not interested
in a single thing you have to say.
Josh?
Are we done?
Anybody could get over that fence.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Remember when you were a kid,
you used to help me mow the lawn?
I remember you yelling at me
for missing spots.
I wanted you to do a good job.
Take pride in your work. Be a man.
Yeah, well, it worked.
No matter what the situation,
I just think about what you would do
and I do the opposite. Never failed.
That's my Tommy.
He's got all the answers, huh?
When it comes to you, I do.
All right then, answer me this.
The last time I went in the hospital,
the time I didn't make it out,
why didn't you come see me?
It's a simple question, Tom.
Agent Baldwin,
would you like some iced tea?
Let's see, there were Barry,
Kathleen and the twins--
Oh, and they cried
all through dinner.
--Philip and his new girlfriend.
Oh, I'm afraid
I don't remember her name.
Roger and Julie.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Julie was sick that day.
Sinus headache.
She gets them all the time.
- That's my grandson Randy.
- He works for door-to-door delivery?
- He's still finding himself.
- Does he know about your ability?
Oh, of course he does.
He was here at that dinner.
He had two helpings of chicken.
The neighbor says
Randy left a few hours ago.
No idea where he went.
We know he's not at work.
I'm gonna check the bedroom,
see if I can find an address book.
Don't you guys ever stop for lunch?
I thought I'd gotten rid of you.
No, no, no.
We still have some ground to cover.
You know that thing that you said
about how you've moved on,
that you put me behind you?
You know,
I'm not really sure I'm buying it.
I don't care.
Well, maybe not.
But if you're so over me,
how come you haven't had
a single serious relationship
since we broke up?
I have had plenty
of serious relationships.
Ones that were a lot more respectful
and successful
than the one I had with you.
- You wanna name one?
- What do you call Marco?
I'd call him a very sweet guy
who'd do anything for you.
You could learn something
from him.
Still, it's a relationship
with no future and you know it.
That's why you're with him.
Look, I have no idea
what kind of future I've got with Marco.
We haven't been going out
that long.
So you're gonna go out
for a couple months,
and then when he pushes you
for a commitment,
you're gonna finally tell him
the truth:
That there isn't any chemistry.
That you're not right for each other.
All things you already know.
Is that really the way
I treat the guys I date?
Di, you're an amazing woman,
and I blew it.
What I did to you was cruel,
but you can't keep
protecting yourself forever.
It's not fair to you.
It's not fair to Marco.
Offhand, I'd say
somebody's been doing some baking.
Yeah,
but where did all the cookies go?
Look, buddy, I know you're busy,
but you never answered my question.
Why didn't you come see me
when I was dying?
Dad,
I really can't talk about this now.
It's not my favorite memory either.
Well, so let's get it over
and done with.
I'll leave you alone.
You mean if I tell you, that's it?
We're done? You're gone?
Be a step in the right direction.
I was in Baltimore
working on a case for the Bureau.
When I got the call from Mom,
I booked a flight home.
I was all set to go,
but then the case heated up
and I missed my plane.
By the time I could get another,
it was too late.
I asked you for the truth, Tommy.
You're just giving me excuses.
You want the truth?
I stayed away as a favor to you.
You didn't want me there, Dad.
Whatever I'd say, whatever I'd do,
it'd only piss you off like always.
I figured my not being there
would make it easier for you.
I let you die in peace.
I wanted to see you one last time.
You're my son, Tommy. I love you.
Yeah, well, that's nice to hear,
but it's a little too late.
I know. It was my fault. I'm sorry.
But I did want you there, Tommy.
You were wrong about me,
about how I felt.
Maybe you're wrong
about some other things.
I hope you're gonna show me
a cabinet filled with cookies.
I wish.
I think he took them with him.
You better take a look at that.
I found it wedged behind the dresser.
Looks like he kept a record
of everyone he dosed.
Think it's some kind of enemies list?
He's trying to get back
at all these people?
Diana.
That's the food fair. It starts today.
Now we know
where he took the cookies.
Tom.
Stop!
Get up.
- Where are the rest of the cookies?
- There aren't any more. I swear.
He's only just opened the box.
Looks like we made it just in time.
Diana.
Go.
Nice work, you two.
NTAC Medical is gonna be busy
for some time.
We'll keep them under observation,
get them some counseling.
I take it you both have been too busy
ignoring your medical leave
to deal with your own situations.
We figured first things first.
Yeah, I know.
If my dad showed up,
I'd be spending
a lot of time at work too.
But now, I want you both to go home
and deal with this thing.
If you feel you can't,
we'll book you adjoining suites
at NTAC Medical. Okay?
I just want you to know,
I never meant to hurt anyone.
Tell that to Erika Lundgren
and the others who died.
I'm really sorry about that. Honestly.
But all I did was give them a chance
to deal with their problems.
You know, face to face.
I just wanted to share
the enlightenment.
I guess they couldn't handle it.
Well, I don't get the connection.
Why send the cookies to us?
What are you talking about?
You guys exposed
the promicin scandal.
You saved my grandmother's life.
It was a gift.
My way of saying thank you.
"Thank you"?
I guess no good deed
ever goes unpunished, huh?
All this stuff lsabelle told you,
sure she wasn't making it up,
scaring you?
Trying to keep you close?
Because I'm telling you, Shawn,
this sounds crazy.
I can heal people.
You can move things with your mind.
We live in a crazy world.
When she was a baby, even younger,
when she was in her mother's womb,
I knew she was different.
Dangerous.
Richard, if I believed that staying
with lsabelle would save all those lives,
I would marry her tomorrow.
But what happens a month from now?
Or a year?
What happens if she gets tired of me?
Or I make her angry?
I get it.
But marrying her is not the answer.
We gotta find another way
to stop her.
She's my daughter, Shawn.
What would you have me do?
Hey, I was out
with some of the guys.
I came right over
as soon as I got your voice mail.
You okay?
I picked up some ltalian
on the way here.
Don't be nice to me.
I don't like the sound of that.
I know this isn't pleasant,
but you're doing the right thing.
Does this mean
we can say goodbye?
As a matter of fact, it does.
Try not to miss me, Di.
I won't.
Goodbye?
You mean you're leaving?
All I've been doing
is making you miserable.
I figure I did enough of that
when you were a kid growing up.
Yeah, we're done here.
Made about as much progress
as we can make.
You take care.
I'd shake your hand
but it doesn't work that way.
Dad?
You know what I said before about...
Why missing that flight home
was a favor to you?
That wasn't true.
I never thought it was.
I did it for me.
Just the idea of standing around
that hospital room watching you die,
with all that anger still between us,
knowing that we'd never work it out,
that we'd...
We'd never be as close
as I wanted us to be? I couldn't do it.
It's okay, Tommy.
I didn't deserve to have you there.
I should have been there anyway.
I'm sorry.
The clock just ran out on us, huh?
Well, I guess
there's no clock now, is there?
I got all the time in the world.
Not that we have to use it.
Why don't you come and sit down?
- Tommy, we don't have to do this.
- I know. Why don't you...?
Why don't you just come back
in the kitchen and park it, okay?
I never liked eating alone.
Nothing worse.
So,
what do you wanna talk about?
Happy now?
You tried.
Didn't work.
You can't kill me, Shawn.
I guess we're gonna get married
after all.
Durant les 60 dernières années
4400 personnes ont été enlevées,
toutes sont revenues au même instant
sans aucun souvenir du lieu où elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieillies
Et certaines d'entre elles sont revenues
avec des nouvelles facultés.
En espérant renouer ...
... avec leurs vies interrompues
Nous ne sommes pas une menace,
nous sommes le salut.
Le monde devra faire avec nous.
Précédemment, dans les 4400...
Tu es si gentil.
J'aimerais pouvoir t'emmener avec quand j'y retourne,
mais je ne peux pas.
Hier, seulement quelques patients s'étaient réunis
pour travailler sur cette chose,
mais aujourd'hui c'est l'hôpital entier.
Si on sort Tess d'ici,
Tu crois que ça va s'arrêter ?
Je m'injecte une version modifiée
de la promicine.
J'ai appris à mon corps à produire
cette promicine,
et je serai le premier "non-revenu"
à développer des facultés des 4400.
Episode 9
The ballad of Kevin and Tess
Arrêtez de courir, Dr Burkoff.
Venez avec nous maintenant.
Non, reculez, je ne veux blesser personne.
C'est très rassurant.
On va s'en souvenir.
M. Tyler, entrez.
Que puis-je faire pour vous ?
J'aimerais vous poser des questions sur
votre travail ici.
Bien sûr, j'enseigne des matières comme l'histoire...
Je ne parle pas de l'enseignement,
Je parle de votre don.
Je crois savoir que vous utilisez
votre don sur les enfants ?
C'est exact.
Ma faculté est de mettre
en avant leurs facultés.
C'est plus où moins ce que j'ai fait
depuis que je suis revenue.
Si un élève avait un don,
comme tous les enfants ont ici,
Je l'aidais à l'utiliser, à le contrôler,
à acquérir de l'assurance.
Est-ce que cela fonctionnait avec les adultes ?
Pas à l'époque, mais
Je n'ai pas réessayé depuis qu'on
m'a enlevé l'inhibiteur.
Pourquoi ?
J'ai développé de nouvelles facultés
depuis quelques mois.
La télékinésie.
Quel mot, hein ?
J'ai fait comme si je n'avais rien.
C'est fantastique !
je ne sais que peu de chose.
Pour l'instant ça ne fonctionne qu'avec
des objets inanimés,
des petits objets.
Mais quand je suis en colère ou excité,
je peux faire beaucoup plus.
Et vous aimeriez le contrôler
quand vous êtes calme aussi ?
Oui, je suppose que
c'est pour ça que je suis là.
Combien de fois dois-je encore vous
le répéter ?
Je n'ai injecté de la promicine à personne
d'autre que moi-même.
Vous êtes sûr de ça ?
Vous êtes un des meilleurs scientifiques.
Je trouve difficile à croire que vous n'ayez pas
d'autres cobayes.
Ce n'est pas une simple étude scolaire
Regardez-moi !
Vous pensez que c'est facile
de trouver des volontaires ?
Non, je ne pense pas.
On dirait que vous ne vous sentez
pas très bien.
Oui.
En effet, j'ai mes propres problèmes.
Vous pouvez vous relaxer maintenant,
l'expérience est terminée.
Cela va seulement faire mal une minute.
Emballez-le.
On va l'emmener pour l'autopsie.
Dépêchez-vous d'amenez le Dr Burkoff ici.
Nous devons avoir fini d'ici demain matin.
Maman ?
Maman ?
Est-ce que ça va ?
Oui, bien sûr chérie, ça va.
Pourquoi ça ne serait pas le cas ?
J'ai fait un mauvais rêve
et tu étais dedans.
Eh bien, pourquoi tu ne m'en parlerais pas ?
Tu t'étais transformée en monstre.
C'était horrible.
Ca avait l'air si réel.
C'était toi.
Mais tu étais différente.
Quelle sorte de monstre ?
Mignon.
Quelque chose à coller sur le frigo.
Cela ne t'es pas destiné ?
Ce n'est pas une prémonition,
juste un cauchemar, pas vrai ?
Je pense, mais quand ta fille a des visions, tu n'as
pas envie qu'elle te donne des dessins comme celui-là.
Skouris à l'appareil
Merci de m'avoir rappelé.
Prévenez-moi si vous le voyez, ok ?
Tout va bien ?
Peut-être.
Je ne suis pas certaine.
Enfin, c'était le centre des 4400.
J'espérais que peut-être
ils avaient vu le Dr Burkoff.
Je suis passée à son appartement hier
mais il n'était pas là.
Diana.
Pourquoi être passée à l'appartement
du Dr Burkoff ?
Tu as vraiment vu sa main
se guérir d'elle-même ?
Oui, il a sorti le scalpel et la blessure
s'est refermée au bout de quelques secondes.
Il a développé une faculté.
De toute façon, il est comme un des leurs.
Il naviguait entre les deux mondes.
Quoi ?
Je devrais être au courant d'autres personnes
développant des facultés des 4400 ?
J'aurais dû te le dire plus tôt.
Oui, tu aurais dû !
Diana !
Certaines personnes jouent au tennis durant leur temps libre,
d'autres collectionnent les vieux vinyles.
Mais toi, tu t'amuses avec le seul homme qui ...
s'il a développé une faculté comme tu le dis,
est peut-être vraiment le père
de la technologie des 4400,
tout comme le futur l'a prédit.
Vous deux êtes les seuls au courant
de cette expérience ?
Je pensais que oui...
mais j'en suis moins sûr maintenant,
et c'est ce qui m'inquiète.
Tom, et si quelqu'un avait trouvé
ce qu'il faisait ?
Et bien, s'il réussissait, cela pourrait être
un grand coup de pub pour les facultés des 4400.
Beaucoup de personnes préféreraient
garder le génie dans sa lampe.
Ne voudrais-tu pas rendre nos jobs plus faciles ?
Est-ce que ... ça va ?
Oui, c'est juste mon allergie.
J'ai parlé à sa famille, ils n'ont pas de nouvelles
de lui depuis des mois.
Ok, qui d'autre pourrait
être au courant alors ?
"Je ne savais pas que les chats
souriaient toujours jusqu'aux oreilles..."
"En effet, je ne savais pas que les chats
pouvaient grimacer," dit Alice très poliment.
"Tu ne sais pas grand-chose,"
dit la duchesse.
"Et c'est un fait."
Nous finirons ce chapitre demain.
J'espère que vous allez tous le faire.
J'ai vécu dans un centre de désintoxication
pendant environ 3 mois.
J'ai eu ce boulot il y a deux semaines.
C'est très bien, Tess.
Ils ont donc trouvé des médicaments
qui fonctionnent pour vous ?
Pour l'instant, oui.
J'ai toujours ma maladie.
Ca se calme mais la psychose ne partira jamais.
Mais...
Cela fait longtemps que
je n'ai pas eu de symptômes.
En espérant que je n'en aurai pas.
Donc, ces enfants à qui vous lisez vos histoires seront les
prochains à vous aider pour contacter le futur ?
Je ne pense pas.
Je peux à peine me souvenir de cette histoire.
Je ne suis pas sûr de savoir comment j'ai pu
contraindre ces hommes à travailler;
ou pourquoi ils ont mis ces schémas dans ma tête.
Je suis fière d'avoir fait en sorte
que Kevin aille mieux mais...
c'est toujours si bizarre.
C'est la raison pour laquelle nous sommes là.
Avez-vous vu Kevin ces derniers temps ?
Non.
Je l'ai appelé quand je suis sortie
de l'institution,
on a bu un café.
Je ne l'ai pas vu depuis des mois,
Il va bien ?
Et bien nous n'en sommes pas sûrs, mais nous aimerions lui parler.
S'il vous contacte, pouvez-vous nous tenir au courant ?
Bien entendu.
Si vous le trouvez,
vous pouvez lui dire de m'appeler ?
Bien sûr.
C'était un plaisir de vous revoir Tess.
Au revoir.
Je viens de parler à la responsable.
Elle va d'abord interviewer
des personnes que vous avez guéris.
Et ensuite ce sera votre tour après la pause.
Elle dit que l'émotion rapporte beaucoup d'audience,
donc, ne vous gênez pas pour pleurer...
On verra ça.
Rose est un peu curieuse, elle va vouloir
que vous répondiez à beaucoup de questions.
Laissons de côté la vie privé, ok ?
Nick !
Nick, s'il te plaît, réveilles-toi !
Nick ! S'il te plaît, réveilles-toi !
Mon Dieu, c'est Nick Crowley.
Oh mon Dieu, vous êtes le 4400 qui guérit !
Aidez-le, s'il vous plaît.
Nick, Nick réveille-toi.
si vous allez bien,
dites quelque chose.
Jim Morrison vous salue.
Doucement, doucement les gars.
Vous venez de sauver Nick Crauwlet.
De la part de milliers de fans de Rock and Roll,
laissez-moi vous remercier.
Vous pouvez poser vos mains sur moi
quand vous le voulez.
Elle était un peu grande.
Donc je l'ai fait ajuster.
Elle est parfaite maintenant.
Je crois que Maman sera très contente, non ?
Lily t'a donné cette bague,
alors je suppose que tu peux en
faire ce qu'il te plaît.
Je pense qu'elle est parfaite.
As-tu déjà réfléchi à ce
que tu vas dire au mariage ?
Normalement le père de la mariée
doit faire un discours.
Ben...
Tout cela est arrivé tellement vite.
Je n'ai pas vraiment eu le temps
d'y penser jusqu'à présent.
Pas de problème, j'ai quelques idées.
Il y a un article sur les
discours dans cette revue.
Lis-le.
Je pense que je peux y arriver tout seul.
Papa, je veux que tu le lises.
Ce soir !
Salut.
J'ai amené de quoi manger.
Laisse-moi t'aider avec ça.
Merci, mes articulations sont un peu rouillées.
Kevin, pourquoi caches-tu ton visage ainsi ?
Car tu ne devrais pas me voir comme ça.
Pourquoi ?
Diana et Jack sont passés
à la librairie aujourd'hui
et ont posé des questions à ton sujet.
Je suppose que Diana était inquiète,
comme une mère avec son enfant.
Je pense, oui.
Elle était un peu malade.
Kevin, je me suis sentie mal à l'aise.
Je n'aime pas ce qu'on lui fait.
Ce que je lui fais...
Moi non plus,
mais c'est pour notre cause,
pour changer le monde.
Et pour le meilleur, il faut continuer,
même si ça doit mal se passer.
Kevin, ça se passe déjà mal.
Quelqu'un t'as tiré dessus hier.
Je sais, mais ...
cette expérience en vaut la peine.
Et j'ai besoin d'aide;
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Il faut que je continue.
Et pour ça, j'ai besoin de Diana,
et de toi.
Est-ce que Shawn est dans le coin ?
J'ai quelque chose pour lui.
J'ai enregistré mon premier album avec.
Je l'ai conservé là-dedans depuis des années.
Vous me la donnez vraiment ?
Tu m'as sauvé la vie.
Ca me paraît être équitable.
Tu sais, cette faculté que tu as...
Ca fonctionne tout le temps ?
Oui, en gros.
Oh mon Dieu !
J'aimerais pouvoir te ramener 15 ans en arrière,
Une carrière dans le Rock and Roll...
C'est comme si tu vivais dans ton propre monde.
On perd beaucoup de personnes en chemin.
Un jour tu te retournes,
et tu es le dernier survivant.
Vous devriez faire plus attention à vous,
Je ne serai pas toujours là.
J'ai le sentiment de te devoir
plus qu'une guitare.
On joue demain soir
et j'aimerais t'inviter dans les coulisses.
Tu pourras te balader, voir le spectacle.
- Vraiment ?
Bien sûr.
Je pense que c'est utile de t'avoir à mes côtés;
si je passe l'arme à gauche, tu pourras toujours
poser tes mains sur moi.
Il fait froid, vous devriez prendre une veste.
Elle n'a rien dit sur le chemin ?
Bien sûr que non Kevin.
Elle se rend à peine compte.
Tu es si courageuse.
J'ai toujours voulu te le donner en premier.
Je pense que tu mérites une faculté.
Je suis triste que ça doive se passer
sans ton autorisation.
On peut commencer ?
Donnez votre main au Dr Burkoff.
Maman, je vais être en retard à l'école
si on ne part pas tout de suite.
Je suis désolée chérie,
je me suis rendormie après le reveil.
Je serai prête d'ici quelques ...
Maman, tout va bien ?
Ca va, je me suis juste cassé un ongle.
Salut !
Salut Marko.
Que fais-tu ici ?
Euh ... Tom m'a demandé de jeter un oeil
à l'ordinateur de Burkoff.
Tu vas bien ? J'ai entendu
que tu avais une grippe ?
Hé, tu n'es pas censée être
en congé maladie ?
Pouriez-vous arrêter de me traiter
comme si j'avais la peste ?
Je vais bien.
Est-ce qu'on a appris quelque chose ?
Les ordinateurs ne contiennent aucunes données,
mais vraiment aucunes données...
Il n'y a aucun fichier, aucune trace de rien.
Comme si quelqu'un avait échangé le disque dur.
Donc soit il l'a emmené,
Ou quelqu'un l'a pris.
Diana, ... regarde ça.
Est-ce ... kevin ?
Oui.
Mon Dieu. Avez-vous vu les
conséquences de ses injections ?
Je ne l'ai pas vu depuis des semaines,
Je n'avais pas idée qu'il deviendrait comme ça.
Tu penses que c'est un autoportrait ?
Non, Kevin n'est même pas capable de faire un café.
Ce n'est pas Tess qui aimait dessiner ?
J'ai comme une impression bizarre.
Tout va bien.
Je sais que ça peut être un peu gênant.
Bon,
Parfois quand j'ai des problèmes
pour commencer avec mes élèves,
je prends leurs mains.
Ca aide beaucoup.
Vous êtes prêt ?
Je pense, oui.
Détendez-vous, ok ?
Je suis désolé...
Pour être honnête je suis gêné.
Personne ne m'a tenu les mains depuis
que ma femme est morte.
Ca va aller.
Parfois, ça peut prendre plus d'une session
pour que ça fonctionne.
Diana ?
Diana ?
Je dois t'appeler un taxi ?
Je peux m'occuper de cette affaire si tu veux.
Non, je vais bien.
As-tu vu Tess ?
Non, pas encore.
Ecoute Tom, j'ai un rendez-vous
avec le médecin demain matin.
En attendant j'aimerais continuer
à travailler sur cette affaire.
Je dois t'avouer
que ça ne ressemble pas à une grippe.
C'est comme si je me traînais
d'un endroit à un autre.
Elle est là.
Entrez.
Quoi ?
Un nouveau look ?
Un look ?
Ca fait 10 ans que je m'habille comme ça.
Hé, vous n'êtes pas là à propos
du mariage n'est-ce pas ?
Je prends officiellement un jour de repos !
Ceci n'a rien à voir avec le mariage
à moins que Nick Crawley ne soit invité.
Il est en bas.
Vraiment ?
Il faut que je me prépare,
peut-être veut-il faire un tour avant.
Non je ne pense pas.
Alors pourquoi ?
Je n'ai jamais assez de réserve.
Regardez-moi.
Qu'est-ce qu'il raconte ?
Nick a une prescription
pour des antibiotiques.
Ces pillules sont supposées l'aider
à arrêter de boire.
Il les a finalement essayé.
Je suppose qu'il a chargé la dose ?
C'est pareil pour tout...
Il a insisté pour venir ici
au lieu d'aller à l'hôpital.
Tu peux me signer ma prescription ?
Fais du pire que tu peux.
S'il vous plaît.
Viens dans mes bras, mon fils béni...
Allonges-toi, allonges-toi.
Ma vie est entre tes mains.
Kevin.
Dr Burkoff, je me suis fait du souci.
Que faites-vous caché ici ?
Mon Dieu ! Regardez-vous !
Dr Burkoff,
Vous devez venir avec nous,
vous avez besoin d'aide.
Je ne peux pas, des gens essaient de me tuer.
Quels gens ? Qui essaie de vous tuer ?
Je crois qu'ils travaillent
pour le gouvernement.
Non, ils ne travaillent pas pour l'NTAC.
Vous êtes sûrs ? Car j'ai des doutes.
Ecoutez Kevin, vous nous connaissez,
si vous venez avec nous, on vous protègera.
De toute façon, je ne vous laisse pas le choix.
En fait, je crois que vous n'allez pas
avoir le choix non plus.
Diana, que fais-tu ?
Je ne sais pas, Tom. Je suis désolée.
Diana n'est pas tout à fait
elle-même en ce moment.
Elle fera tout ce que Tess lui dira de faire.
Tess, peux-tu prendre son arme ?
S'il vous plaît...
Je suis si proche du but.
Arrêtez de me poursuivre.
Je ne veux pas vous faire de mal.
Diana... Ca va ?
Tu vas bien ?
Je ne sais pas.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Tu m'as menacé avec ton arme.
Tess ?
Oh punaise !
- Quoi ?
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Je me sens bizarre.
Oh mon Dieu.
C'est quoi ça ?
Des lésions.
Comme celles de Kevin quand il a commencé
à s'injecter la promicine.
On doit t'emmener voir les docteurs de l'NTAC.
Il nous les faut sains et saufs.
Les informations concernant les expériences
que le Dr Burkoff menait,
beaucoup de personnes
à Washington vont les vouloir.
Sa photo circule déjà dans
les commissariats locaux.
Nous allons les distribuer dans le voisinage
de l'appartement de Burkoff,
et dans la maison de vacances
où il est parti se cacher.
Et peut-être qu'on aura de la chance.
Et alors ? On doit dire aux gens
qu'une sorte de monstre s'est enfui ?
Non, si quelqu'un demande,
on leur dit que le Dr Burkoff a un cancer
dans un stade avancé.
Oui, mais...
Est-ce que vous pensez vraiment
que nous allons réussir
à ramener cet homme en vie.
Enfin, regardez ça !
Vous ne pensez pas qu'ils vont d'abord tiré
et ensuite poser des questions ?
C'est pour ça qu'il faut
qu'on le retrouve en premier.
Malgré tout ce dont le Dr Burkoff est coupable, il a quand
même sauver beaucoup de vies de l'inhibiteur.
Le point positif c'est que dans son état
il ne sera pas très dur à localiser.
Je ne sais pas.
Ce sont de belles mains, mais
elles n'ont pas l'air magiques.
Tu t'es déjà fait des amis ?
Très bon choix.
Je parle par expérience.
Le spectacle était génial.
Merci beaucoup pour l'invitation.
Tu me remercies, moi ?
Le spectacle aurait été annulé sans toi.
Ecoute,
j'ai eu une idée excellente durant la pause.
Pourquoi ne viendrais-tu pas
en tournée avec nous ?
Faire quoi ?
Tu pourrais commencer avec Mischa,
travailler sur la promo.
Ok, c'est tentant mais...
j'ai beaucoup à faire ici à Seattle, tu sais.
Je dois me marier bientôt.
Dans ce cas, tu dois venir avec nous.
Ce sera comme une version longue
de ton enterrement de vie de garçon.
On prendra bien soin de toi.
Promis.
Une promesse de Mischa, c'est aussi sûr
que de l'argent dans une banque.
En plus, j'aimerais t'avoir avec nous.
Tu arrives à faire en sorte que...
Je sois en forme.
Tu veux dire au top.
Oui bien sûr, c'est ça.
Euh, c'est juste que je ne suis pas
ton médecin personnel, tu sais ?
Bien sûr que tu ne l'es pas.
Tu es de loin le meilleur
docteur que j'ai jamais rencontré.
Penses-y, mais pas trop longtemps.
Pourquoi réfléchir ? Tu dirais non à tout ça ?
Alors, que voulez-vous ce matin ?
Est-ce que je peux avoir du steak et des oeufs ?
Pouvez-vous me le faire très saignant ?
Merci.
Dr Burkoff a été vu au restaurant Beacon Hill,
il y est toujours.
Ramenez-le sans vous faire remarquez, si possible,
mais ramenez-le.
Diana, réveillez-vous.
Dr Anapurn.
Je croyais que je devais dormir ?
Vous m'avez drogué.
Vous avez été virée.
Vous devez venir avec moi.
Je ne sais pas.
Il a dû partir il y a 15 minutes.
Il vous a dit où il allait ?
Non, il n'a même pas touché son repas.
Il est parti en quatrième vitesse.
Il faut que j'aille récupérer des pourboires.
Où allons-nous ?
Merci.
Vous pouvez retourner à votre bureau maintenant.
Tess.
Ne faites pas ça.
Désolée, j'aurais aimé que se soit quelqu'un d'autre,
mais ce n'est pas le cas.
On ferait mieux d'y aller, il nous attend.
Comment ai-je pu faire ça ?
Je ne me rappelle rien.
Diana ne se rappelle plus comment elle est arrivée
à l'appartement de kevin cette nuit non plus.
Si le Dr Burkoff l'a fait évadée d'ici,
il doit être désespéré et doit manquer de temps.
Ce qui veut dire qu'il veut finir son expérience.
Il va vouloir augmenter son dosage.
Si on ne retrouve pas Diana rapidement,
elle va finir dans le même état que Kevin.
Je pense que c'est le silence notre problème.
C'est trop gênant.
A la place de se dévisager l'un et l'autre,
on pourrait...
se parler.
Ok.
Vous voulez parler de quelque chose de précis ?
Non. Vous savez, c'est à vous de décider.
J'ai pensé à mes parents récemment,
à ce qu'ils auraient pensé de tout ça.
Cet endroit.
Moi.
Assis ici, en essayant de savoir
comment utiliser mon...
Don pour la télékinésie.
Vous savez, vous pouvez en parler à voix haute,
Il n'y a pas de honte à ça.
Oui, vous pouvez dire ça.
Mais quand je suis revenu,
j'étais un 4400, mais sans don.
Je n'avais rien ...
... rien à quoi je pouvais m'accrocher.
Maintenant vous devez vous faire à l'idée
que vous êtes spécial.
C'est ce que mes parents auraient pensé
s'ils avaient été là ?
Oh... Ou peut-être ils auraient pensé
que leur fils est devenu un monstre.
Richard.
A l'époque où vous avez été enlevé,
Vous étiez un des premiers
pilotes noirs dans l'armée.
Vous faisiez partie de l'avant-garde.
Aujourd'hui vous faites partie
d'une autre sorte d'avant-garde.
Ils vous ont choisi pour une raison.
Je pense que vos parents seraient fiers de vous.
Oui...
Vous avez certainement raison.
Richard ?
Wah, j'ai l'impression que ça fonctionne.
Cela devrait convenir.
On peut travailler ici quelques temps.
Dis-lui qu'il peut rentrer.
S'il vous plaît, vous devez m'aider.
Dites quelque chose.
Ca ne sert à rien.
Il ne va se rappeler de rien.
Merci.
Vous pouvez rentrer maintenant.
Kevin ?
Tu veux un peu d'eau ?
Non.
Je vais bien.
Kevin,
Vous allez mourir.
Vous êtes en train de vous tuer.
Et vous allez me tuer aussi.
Non.
Vous n'allez pas mourir.
Mon travail
est garanti.
Etes-vous sûr ?
Regardez-vous !
Si ça ne fonctionne pas chez moi,
Le problème ne vient pas de l'expérience,
mais de moi.
Tous ces traitements, pendant toutes ces années,
tous ces médicaments ont dû me changer.
Je ne suis pas un bon sujet.
Il n'y a pas de bon sujet.
Kevin, vous êtes brillant mais vous avez tort.
Vous avez échoué mais vous n'avez plus l'esprit
assez clair pour le voir.
Mon esprit
n'est pas compromis.
Vous aviez raison sur un point Diana.
Il serait très facile de renoncer.
Mais nous devons être plus courageux que ça.
Et...
Si nécessaire...
Je me prépare à être courageux pour nous deux.
Tu travailles sur une chanson ?
La fin d'une chanson.
Je n'arrive pas. Inspiration.
Quoi ?
Tu es choqué ? Je bois mon repas.
Je n'ai rien dit.
Tant mieux, parce que...
écoute, cette chose là est appellée:
"maintenir un niveau sordide".
C'est un peu effrayant en fait.
Shawn !
Ne t'inquiètes pas.
J'ai fait le voeu solennel
de ne plus déconner...
A moins que tu ne sois à côté.
Oui, justement, ce genre de chose...
Tu ne seras pas à mes côtés, c'est ça ?
Tu sais,
Faire la tournée,
Je le voulais.
C'est juste que...
on se connaît depuis si peu de temps.
Ce don que j'ai,
c'est une énorme responsabilité, tu vois.
Et je ne veux pas être trop dur, mec, mais...
je ne crois pas qu'il était destiné à ...
sauver uniquement une Rock Star.
Tu n'en es pas sûr.
Peut-être qu'ils t'ont renvoyé...
pour me garder en vie afin...
que je finisse mon album.
Ecoutes, si jamais tu as de nouveau des problèmes,
je ne pourrai pas être là pour toi.
Besoin d'aide.
Appelez NTAC.
Vous avez toujours le temps, vous savez.
On peut le sauver.
Je crois que vous devriez avoir
un peu plus confiance en Kevin.
Il peut réussir.
Il est spécial.
C'est pour cela qu'on m'a demandé
de le réveiller.
Tess ?
J'ai perdu la seringue
quand nous avons quitté la cabane.
Est-ce que tu l'as vu ?
Non.
J'en ai besoin.
Elle doit être là.
Peut-être qu'elle a glissé en dessous.
Ah.
Kevin ?
Je crois que j'ai été piquée par quelque chose.
C'est quoi ?
Ne bougez plus Dr Burkoff !
Tess ?
-Vous êtes encerclés, vous ne vous échapperez pas.
Non, ne tirez pas.
Il ne va pas s'enfuir.
Diana, ça va ?
-Tom !
Arrêtez-vous Burkoff !
Les mains en l'air.
Ils seront en fuite pendant pas mal de temps.
Tess sera à court de médicament
et Burkoff n'est pas vraiment très communicatif.
Ils vont se montrer, nous les trouverons.
Tu veux dire qu'on trouvera Tess.
Je ne pense pas que Burkoff
vive plus d'une semaine.
Je ne comprends pas.
Il est supposé être le père
de la technologie des 4400
C'est la raison pour laquelle
ils l'ont réveillé.
C'est seulement leur théorie.
Peut-être avez-vous trop de foi dans le futur.
Diana va bien ?
Oui, elle va tenir le coup.
Elle est en bas, dans les laboratoires d'NTAC.
Tu nous as trouvé une voiture ?
Quelqu'un me l'a prêtée.
Mr Raylan veut un rapport
concernant la promicine.
On est bon.
Très bon même.
On a assez de stock pour
tenir au moins deux ans...

<i>We're not a threat,</i>
<i>we're salvation.</i>
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> the 4400...
you're so sweet.
I wish i could take you with me
when i go,
but i can't.
[Diana]: Yesterday,
a few patients were compelled
to work on this thing,
and today,
it's the entire hospital.
If we get tess
out of here,
do you think
this compulsion will fade?
I'm injecting myself
<i>with a modified version</i>
<i>of the promicin serum.</i>
<i>I will have taught my body</i>
<i>how to produce</i>
<i>promicin,</i>
<i>and then i will be</i>
<i>the first</i>
non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.
Enough running, dr. Burkhoff.
You need to come with us now.
No.
Stay back.
I don't want to
hurt anyone.
That's very reassuring.
We'll keep that in mind.
No! No!
[Gasping]: No!
Mr. Tyler. Come in.
What can i do
for you?
I wanted to ask you
about your work
with the students here.
Sure.
I teach three classes,
history, art, and...
i'm not talking
about your teaching.
I was talking about
the "counseling" that you do.
I understand
you use your ability
with the kids?
That's right.
My ability is to help them
focus their abilities.
It's pretty much
what i've been doing
ever since i came back.
If a student
has a talent...
like all of our kids here do...
i help them learn
how to use it,
gain control of it,
build their confidence.
Does it work with adults?
It didn't used to,
but i haven't tried it
since i've been
off the inhibitor. Why?
I developed this ability
a few months ago...
telekinesis.
What a word, huh?
I can't even say it
with a straight face.
That's fantastic.
I've just been pretending
it isn't there.
I mean, i know
a little bit about it.
So far, it only works
with inanimate objects,
little stuff.
But when i'm mad or excited,
i can do a lot more
with it.
And you're looking to control it
when you're calm?
Yeah, that's why i'm here,
i guess.
How many times
do i have to go over this
with you people?
I have not been
injecting promicin
into anyone but myself.
You're certain of that?
You're a world-class
scientist.
I find it
difficult to believe
you wouldn't build
a redundancy plan
into your experiment.
This isn't
your basic sleep study.
I mean, look at me.
Do you think
i'd have an easy time
finding volunteers?
No. I do not.
Oh.
You look like you're in
quite a bit of discomfort to me.
[Chuckles bitterly]: Yes.
As a matter of fact,
i am.
Well...
you can relax now.
The experiment's over.
This will only hurt
for a minute.
Bag him.
We'll take him back
for the autopsy.
Get dr. Burkhoff
up there quickly.
They promised results
by the morning.
[***]
* so long ago, another life *
* i can feel your heart beat *
* it's not a dream
remember us *
* i can see it in your eyes *
* we'll find our place in time *
* our place in time
beyond the sun *
* we'll find our place in time *
* our place in time
to call our own *
Mommy?
Mommy?
Are you okay?
Of course, sweetie.
I'm fine.
Why wouldn't i be?
I had a bad dream,
and you were in it.
Well, you get in
and tell me about it.
You turned into
a monster.
It was horrible.
It seemed so real.
It was you.
But you
were different.
What kind
of a monster?
Nice.
Something
for the refrigerator door.
You don't think
there's anything
to this?
It's not a prediction,
right?
Just a bad dream.
Well, i hope so,
but when your daughter's
a precog,
you don't want her
giving you a picture like this.
Hello.
This is skouris.
Well, thank you
for calling me back.
Let me know
if you see him,
all right?
Everything okay?
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
I mean, that was
the 4400 center.
I was hoping maybe
they'd seen dr. Burkhoff.
I stopped by
his apartment yesterday,
and he wasn't home.
Uh, diana.
Why would you be stopping by
dr. Burkhoff's apartment?
You actually saw
the wound in kevin's hand
heal over?
Yes.
He pulled the scalpel out,
and it was gone
within seconds.
He's developing
an ability.
I mean, he's close
to it, anyway.
He said
it comes and goes.
What?
Anyone else developing
a 4400 ability
i should know about?
I should have
told you earlier.
You're damn right
you should have.
Got to hand it
to you, diana...
some people
play racketball
in their spare time,
maybe collect old records,
but you?
You play igor
to the one man who...
Well, if he has developed
an ability, like you say,
maybe he really is
the father of 4400 technology,
just like the future predicted.
Are you two the only ones
who know about this experiment?
I thought we were...
and now i'm not so sure,
and that's what
i'm worried about.
Tom, what if
someone else finds out
what he's up to?
Well, if he succeeds,
we could be talking
about the mass-marketing
of 4400 abilities.
A lot of people would
like to keep that genie
in the bottle.
Wouldn't make our jobs
any easier.
Are you...
are you okay?
It's just my allergies
are acting up.
I've already spoken
to his family.
They haven't heard from him
in months.
Okay, so who else
is he close to?
"I didn't know
"that cheshire cats
always grinned...
in fact, i didn't know
that cats could grin,"
said alice
very politely.
"You don't know much,"
said the duchess.
"And that's a fact."
We'll finish this chapter
tomorrow.
I hope you all can make it.
I've been living
in a halfway house
for about
three months.
I got this job here
two weeks ago.
That's great, tess.
So they found a medication
that works for you?
So far, so good.
I still
have my disease.
Schizophrenia
never goes away,
but i haven't had
any symptoms for a while.
Hopefully i won't.
So these kids
you're reading to,
they're not going to try
and build a tower
to contact the future,
are they?
I don't think so.
I can barely remember
all that now.
I'm still not sure
how i could compel people
to work
or why they put those blueprints
in my head.
I'm glad
it made kevin better,
but it was still so weird.
That's actually
why we're here.
Have you been in touch
with kevin lately?
No.
I called him
when i first got out
of the institution.
We met for coffee,
but i haven't seen him
in months.
Is he okay?
Well,
we're not sure,
but we'd like to
talk to him.
So, if he contacts you,
would you let us know?
Well, of course.
When you find him,
will you have him call me?
Sure.
It's nice to see you
again, tess.
Bye.
I just spoke
with the program coordinator.
She says the first segment
will be interviews
with some of the people
you've healed
and then
they'll bring you out
after the break.
She says
the emotional stuff
also plays well
with her audience,
so feel free
to cry or...
we'll see about that.
They're also curious
about the wedding.
She'd love it
if you answered
some questions...
let's keep the private life
private, okay?
[Woman]: Nick!
Nick, please,
wake up!
Nick!
Nick, please,
wake up!
Oh, jesus,
that's nick crowley.
Oh, my god.
You're that 4400,
the one
with the hands.
Help him, please!
Nick! Nick!
Come on, wake up.
Please!
If you're okay,
say something.
Well, jim morrison says hello.
[Scattered laughter]
Easy. Easy, boys, easy.
You just saved nick crowley.
On behalf
of millions
of rock and roll
burnouts
all over the world,
allow me to thank you.
Any time you want to
lay these on me,
you just let me know.
It was a little bit big,
so i just had it resized.
It's perfect now.
I think
mom would be really happy,
don't you?
Lily gave you
that ring.
I guess you can do
what you want with it.
I think it's perfect.
Have you thought about
what you're going to say
at the wedding?
Usually, the father
of the bride
gives a toast.
Um...
well.
It's all been so sudden.
I haven't had much time
to really plan it yet.
That's okay.
I have a few thoughts.
There's an article
in this magazine on toasts.
Read it.
I think i can handle that
on my own.
Dad, i want you to read it.
Tonight.
Hi.
I bought some food.
Let me help you with that.
Thank you.
My joints
are a little stiff.
Kevin,
why did you put your hood up
when i came in?
You shouldn't have to
look at me like this.
Like what?
Diana skouris and tom baldwin
came by the bookstore today.
They were asking
about you.
I figured
diana would be worried.
How did she look?
Okay, i guess.
A little sick.
Kevin, i felt bad
seeing her.
I don't like
what we're doing to her...
what i'm doing to her.
I don't like it
much, either,
but we are on the cusp
of changing the world...
for the better.
We have to keep going,
even if it gets ugly.
Kevin, it's already ugly.
Someone shot you yesterday.
I know,
but the experiment
is worth the risk.
They woke me up
to do this.
You woke me up
to do this.
I have to move forward.
And to do that,
i need diana.
And i need you.
Is shawn farrell around?
I have something for him.
Oh!
I played that
when we were recording
my first album.
I've been holding onto it
for years.
You're really
giving this to me?
You saved my life.
Seems like a fair trade
to me.
So this, uh,
ability of yours...
it works every time
out of the gate?
Yeah, pretty much.
Oh, my god.
I wish
they brought you back
15 years ago.
A career in rock 'n' roll...
sometimes it feels like
you're living in a war zone.
You lose a lot of people
along the way.
One day you look up,
and you're the last man
standing.
You should take better care
of yourself.
I'm not always around.
I feel like i owe you
more than a guitar.
We're playing tomorrow night
and i wanted to invite you
backstage.
You can hang out,
watch the show
from the wings.
Really?
Sure.
I figure it'll be handy
having you around.
If i keel over,
you can always come out
and do your "hands of god" thing
for an encore.
It's cold.
You should
bring your jacket.
She didn't say anything
on the way over?
Of course not,
kevin.
She hardly ever does.
You're so brave.
I always wanted to
give it to you first.
I thought
you deserved an ability.
I'm sorry
it has to happen
without
your permission.
Can i get this
started?
Give dr. Burkhoff your hand.
mommy
be late for school
if we don't leave soon.
I'm sorry, baby.
I slept through
my alarm.
I'll be ready
in a few...
Mommy,
are you okay?
I'm fine.
I just broke a nail is all.
Ew.
Ew.
Hi.
Hey, marco.
What are you doing down here?
Tom asked me to check out
dr. Burkhoff's computers.
Uh, you okay?
I heard
you had the flu.
Hey.
I thought
you were taking a sick day.
Would everyone please
stop treating me
like a plague patient?
I'm fine.
Have we learned anything
here?
Dr. Burkhoff's computers
are clean.
Like, completely clean.
I mean, there're no saved files,
no records of anything.
It's like someone
took out his hard drives
and swapped them
for new ones.
So either he took them
somewhere...
or someone else has them.
Diana.
Look at this.
Is that...
kevin?
Yeah.
My god.
These are the side effects
of the injections?
I haven't seen him
in a couple of weeks.
I had no idea
he'd gotten so bad.
Think it's a self-portrait?
No way.
Kevin's hands
weren't steady enough
to make coffee.
Didn't tess like to draw?
I feel like i'm in
a staring contest.
It's okay.
I know it can be
a little awkward
at first.
So, sometimes
when i'm having trouble
getting started
with a student,
i'll take their hand.
It helps everything
get rolling.
You up for it?
Yeah.
I guess.
Just relax, okay?
Mm.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I, uh...
to be honest,
i felt a little awkward.
I, uh, i haven't
had someone touch me like that
since, uh...
my wife passed, and...
it's okay.
Sometimes
it takes more than one session
to make headway.
[Distorted voice]:
Diana?
[Distorted]: Diana?
[Normal voice]:
Should i just
call you a cab?
I can handle this
if you want.
No, i'm okay.
Any sign of tess?
No, she hasn't come out yet.
Look, tom.
I made an appointment
with the doctor
for tomorrow morning,
but, for now, i'd just like to
stick with it, okay?
I have to say,
this does not feel like the flu.
It's like
i'm dragging myself around.
Here she is.
Come in.
Hey.
What?
Different look
for you.
"Look?"
I dressed like this
for 10 years.
Hey, you're not going to ask
about the wedding, are you?
I am officially
taking the night off
from all planning.
This has nothing to do
with the wedding...
unless nick crowley's invited.
He's downstairs.
Really?
No, i'm getting ready
for his show.
Maybe he wants to give me
a ride or something.
Uh, i don't think
that's it.
Well, what?
[Slurring]:
I never get enough refills.
I mean, look at me...
What's he saying?
Nick has a prescription
for antabuse.
They're these pills
that are supposed to help him
cut back on his drinking.
He finally
tried some.
I guess
he overdid it, huh?
It's the same thing
he does with everything.
He insisted on coming here
instead of the hospital.
Do your worst.
Please?
Come to my arms,
my beamish boy.
Lie down. Lie down.
You're my little lifeline.
Kevin.
Dr. Burkhoff,
i've been worried about you.
What are you doing,
hiding up here?
My god.
Look at you.
Dr. Burkhoff,
you need to
come with us.
We're going to get you
some help.
I can't do that.
People are trying
to kill me.
What people?
Who's trying
to kill you?
I think they work
for the government.
They don't work
for ntac.
Are you sure
about that?
Because i'm not.
Listen, kevin.
You know us.
If you come in,
we'll protect you.
And, besides,
i'm not taking no for an answer.
Come on.
Actually,
i think
you're going to have to.
Diana?
What the hell
are you doing?
I don't know, tom.
I'm sorry.
Diana's not quite
herself right now.
She'll do
whatever tess wants her to.
Tess,
will you get
his gun, please?
Please.
I am so close to finishing.
Stop trying to find me.
I have no desire
to hurt you.
Diana...
are you okay?
Are you all right?
I don't know.
What happened?
You pulled your gun
on me.
Tess?
Yeah.
[Groaning]: Oh, god.
What?
Something's wrong.
I just feel weird.
Oh, my god.
What are those?
They're lesions.
They're just like
the ones kevin had
when he started
taking promicin.
We need to get you
to ntac medical.
If there's anything at all
to these experiments
dr. Burkhoff
has been conducting,
a lot of people in d.c.
Are going to want to
look over his notes.
These pictures
have already been circulated
to local law enforcement.
We're going to distribute them
around the neighborhood
near dr. Burkhoff's apartment
and the vacation home
where he was hiding.
Maybe we'll get lucky.
So, what, we're supposed to
tell people
that there's some kind of
monster on the loose?
If anyone asks,
we tell them dr. Burkhoff
has werner syndrome.
It's a rare wasting disease.
Okay.
But do you really
think we'll be able
to bring this guy in
safe and sound?
I mean, some cowboy cop
sees this
stumbling
towards him,
you don't think
he might shoot first
and ask questions
later?
That's why we have to
get to him first.
Whatever dr. Burkhoff
is guilty of,
he saved thousands of lives
during the inhibitor scandal.
The good thing
about his condition is,
it shouldn't make him
too hard to spot.
I don't know.
They're nice hands,
but they don't look magical
or anything.
Making friends
already?
Hey.
You've chosen
wisely.
I speak from experience.
The show was amazing.
Thank you so much
for having me.
What are you
thanking me for?
The show would've been canceled
if not for you.
Listen.
I just had the best idea
during the encore.
Why don't you come out
on the road with us?
And do what?
Well, you could start
with mischa
and work your way
onward from there.
[Chuckles]
Okay, yeah, it's tempting,
but i kind of have
a lot on my plate
here in seattle, you know?
I'm supposed
to get married soon.
Well,
in that case,
you have to come with us.
It'll be like
an extended bachelor party.
We'll take good care of you.
Promise.
And a promise
from mischa
is money
in the bank.
Besides, i like
having you along with us.
You keep me...
limber.
You mean upright?
Well, yeah, that too.
Um, it's just
i'm not your personal physician,
you know?
Of course you're not.
You're a hell of a lot better
than any doctor i've ever met.
Oh.
Think about it.
But not too long.
What's to think about?
Who could say "no"
to all of this?
* mr. Sandman
bring me a dream *
* bom, bom
bom, bom *
* make him the cutest
i've ever seen *
* bom, bom
bom, bom *
so what can i get you
this morning?
* then tell him *
* that his lonesome nights
are over *
could i have
the steak and eggs?
Could you make the steak
extremely rare?
* nobody
to call my own *
* bom, bom
bom, bom *
* please turn on
your magic beam *
* mr. Sandman
bring me a dream **
thanks.
Dr. Burkhoff was spotted
at a diner in beacon hill.
He's there right now.
Bring him in quietly,
if you can,
but bring him in.
Diana, wake up.
Dr. Anapurn.
I thought i was
supposed to sleep.
You gave me drugs...
you're being
discharged.
You need to come
with me.
[Grunts]
I don't know.
I guess he left
about 15 minutes ago.
Did he say where
he was headed?
No.
I mean, he didn't
even touch
the food he ordered,
right?
He just left
in a hurry.
Left a good tip,
though.
Where are we going?
Thank you.
You can go back
to your office now.
Tess,
don't do this.
I'm sorry.
I wish
it didn't have to be you,
but there's
no one else.
We'd better go.
He'll be
waiting for us.
How could i have done that?
I don't remember any of it.
Diana doesn't
remember
going to kevin's apartment
at night, either.
If dr. Burkhoff's willing
to break her out of here,
he must be getting desperate.
Feels like
he's running out of time.
Which means he has to
complete the experiment.
He's going to up her dosage.
If we don't find diana soon,
she's going to wind up
in the same shape as kevin.
I think
it's the silence
that's messing us up.
It's too awkward.
So instead of us
just staring
at each other,
i thought we'll talk.
Okay. Um...
is there something specific
you wanted to talk about?
No.
You pick.
Well, i've been thinking about
my parents a lot lately,
what they'd think
of all this,
this place...
me,
sitting here trying to
figure out how to use my...
telekinetic ability?
You know, you can
say it out loud.
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.
Yeah, you can say that,
but when i first got back,
i was a 4400,
but i didn't have
an ability.
I felt normal.
It was something
i could hold on to.
Now you have to
get used to the idea
that you're special.
Is that what my parents
would think
if they were here?
Or would they just think
that their son
had become a freak?
Richard.
When you got taken,
you were one of
the first black pilots
in all of the military.
You were at the vanguard.
Now you're part of
a different vanguard.
There's a reason
they picked you.
I think your parents
would be proud.
Yeah.
Uh...
maybe that's true.
Richard?
Whoa.
Well, i guess
that worked, huh?
This will be fine.
We can work here
for a while.
Tell him
he can go home.
Please.
You have to help me.
Say something.
Don't bother.
He's not going to remember
any of this.
Thank you.
You can
go home now.
[Coughing violently]
Kevin?
Can i get you
some water?
I'm fine.
Kevin.
You're dying.
You're killing yourself.
And now you're going
to kill me, too.
No.
You will not die.
My work...
is valid.
Are you sure?
Look at yourself.
If it isn't
working
in me,
the fault isn't
with the experiment.
It's with me.
All those years,
the shock treatments,
the fistfuls
of medications,
they must have changed me.
I'm not a good subject.
There is no good subject.
Kevin, you're brilliant,
but you're wrong.
You failed,
and you're not
thinking clearly enough
to see that.
My mind
is not compromised.
We are at a point, diana,
where it would be easy
for the timid to turn back.
We have to be braver
than that.
And, if necessary...
[diana, pleading]:
Oh. No...
oh...
i'm prepared to be brave enough
for both of us.
Working on a song?
The end of one.
Can't nail it, though.
Inspiration.
Are you shocked
i'm drinking my lunch?
I didn't say anything.
Good, because this is...
listen...
this here is called
"maintaining a base level."
That's kind of scary, actually.
Shawn.
Don't worry.
I've made a solemn vow
not to over-indulge...
unless, of course,
you're around.
Yeah, that's kind of the thing.
You're not going to be around,
is that it?
You're not coming on the road?
I wanted to.
It's just...
you know, even if it was
for a little while.
This gift i have, though,
it's kind of
a responsibility, you know?
And i don't mean
to be harsh, man,
but i don't think
it was meant to be used
as a rock star's
personal safety net.
You don't know that.
Maybe they sent you back
to keep me alive
so i could finish my album.
Nick,
if you go down again...
i can't be there for you.
There's still time,
you know.
We can save him.
I think maybe you don't have
enough faith in kevin.
He can do this.
He's special.
That's why
they had me wake him up.
Tess?
I packed
an adrenaline shot
when we left
the cabin.
Have you seen it?
No.
I need it.
It has to be here
in case i slip under.
Ah.
Kevin?
I think i got stung
by a bee.
What is this?
Don't move, dr. Burkhoff!
Tess?
There's
nowhere to go.
We've got this place
surrounded.
Nobody fire.
He's not going anywhere.
Diana,
are you all right?
Tom.
Whoa.
Hold still, burkhoff.
Put your hands up.
Burkhoff!
They won't be able
to hide for long.
Tess will run out of meds.
Dr. Burkhoff
is not exactly inconspicuous.
They'll show
themselves,
we'll find them.
You mean we'll find tess.
It doesn't sound like
burkhoff will live out the week.
I don't get it.
He was supposed to be
the father of 4400 technology.
That's why they woke him up.
Well, that's
just our theory.
Maybe you're putting
too much faith in the future.
Diana's okay?
Yeah,
she'll get there.
She's down
in ntac medical.
You got us a ride.
Someone
let me borrow them.

mr. Ryland
wants a status report
on the promicin.
We're good.
Great, actually.
We have enough of a stockpile
to last us
for almost two years.
liukan sync FRM
by www.1000fr.com
Over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted.
All at once they were returned.
With no memory of
where they've been.
They haven't aged a day.
And some have returned
with new abilities.
all are trying to reconnect...
...with a life interrupted.
We're not a threat,
we're salvation.
The world
will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
you're so sweet.
I wish i could take you with me when i go, but i can't.
Yesterday, a few patients were compelled to work on this thing,
and today,
it's the entire hospital.
If we get tess
out of here,
do you think
this compulsion will fade?
I'm injecting myself with a modified version of the promicin serum.
I will have taught my body how to produce promicin,
and then i will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.
Enough running, dr. Burkhoff.
You need to come with us now.
No.
Stay back.
I don't want to
hurt anyone.
That's very reassuring.
We'll keep that in mind.
No! No!
 No!
Mr. Tyler. Come in.
What can i do
for you?
I wanted to ask you about your work
with the students here.
Sure.
I teach three classes,
history, art, and...
i'm not talking
about your teaching.
I was talking about the "counseling" that you do.
I understand you use your ability
with the kids?
That's right.
My ability is to help them
focus their abilities.
It's pretty much
what i've been doing
ever since i came back.
If a student
has a talent...
like all of our kids here do...
i help them learn
how to use it,
gain control of it,
build their confidence.
Does it work with adults?
It didn't used to,
but i haven't tried it since i've been
off the inhibitor.
 Why?
I developed this ability
a few months ago...
telekinesis.
What a word, huh?
I can't even say it
with a straight face.
That's fantastic.
I've just been pretending
it isn't there.
I mean, i know
a little bit about it.
So far, it only works
with inanimate objects,
little stuff.
But when i'm mad or excited,
i can do a lot more
with it.
And you're looking to control it
when you're calm?
Yeah, that's why i'm here,
i guess.
How many times do i have to go over this
with you people?
I have not been injecting promicininto anyone but myself.
You're certain of that?
You're a world-class
scientist.
I find it
difficult to believe
you wouldn't build a redundancy plan
into your experiment.
This isn't
your basic sleep study.
I mean, look at me.
Do you think
i'd have an easy time finding volunteers?
No. I do not.
Oh.
You look like you're in
quite a bit of discomfort to me.
Yes.
Well...
you can relax now.
The experiment's over.
This will only hurt
for a minute.
Bag him.
We'll take him back
for the autopsy.
Get dr. Burkhoff
up there quickly.
They promised results
by the morning.
Mommy?
Mommy?
Are you okay?
Oh, of course, sweetie.
I'm fine.
Why wouldn't i be?
I had a bad dream,
and you were in it.
Well, you get in
and tell me about it.
You turned into
a monster.
It was horrible.
It seemed so real.
It was you.
But you
were different.
What kind
of a monster?
Nice.
Something
for the refrigerator door.
You don't think there's anything
to this?
It's not a prediction,
right?
Just a bad dream.
Well, i hope so, but when your daughter's
a precog,
you don't want her
giving you a picture like this.
Hello.
This is skouris.
Well, thank you
for calling me back.
Let me know if you see him, all right?
Everything okay?
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
I mean, that was
the 4400 center.
I was hoping maybe
they'd seen dr. Burkhoff.
I stopped by
his apartment yesterday,
and he wasn't home.
Uh, diana.
Why would you be stopping by
dr. Burkhoff's apartment?
You actually saw the wound in kevin's hand
heal over?
Yes.
He pulled the scalpel out, and it was gone
within seconds.
He's developing
an ability.
I mean, he's close
to it, anyway.
He said
it comes and goes.
What?
Anyone else developing
a 4400 ability i should know about?
I should have
told you earlier.
You're damn right
you should have.
Got to hand it
to you, diana...
some people play racketball,
in their spare time,
maybe collect old records.
But you?
You play igor
to the one man who...
Well, if he has developed
an ability, like you say,
maybe he really is
the father of 4400 technology,
just like the future predicted.
Are you two the only ones
who know about this experiment?
I thought we were...
and now i'm not so sure,
and that's what
i'm worried about.
Tom, what if someone else finds out
what he's up to?
Well, if he succeeds,
we could be talking
about the mass-marketing
of 4400 abilities.
I'm sure a lot of people would
like to keep that genie in the bottle.
Wouldn't make our jobs
any easier.
Are you...
are you okay?
That's just my allergies
are acting up.
I've already spoken
to his family.
They haven't heard from him
in months.
Okay, so who else
is he close to?
I didn't know that cheshire cats
always grinned...
In fact, i didn't know that cats could grin, said alice
very politely.
"You don't know much,"
said the duchess.
"And that's a fact."
We'll finish this chapter
tomorrow.
I hope you all can make it.
I've been living in a halfway house
for about three months.
I got this job here
two weeks ago.
That's great, tess.
So they found a medication
that works for you?
So far, so good.
I still
have my disease.
Schizophrenia
never goes away,
but i haven't had
any symptoms for a while.
Hopefully i won't.
So these kids you're reading to,
they're not going to try and build a tower
To contact the future,
are they?
I don't think so.
I can barely remember
all that now.
I'm still not sure how i could compel people
to work,
or why they put those blueprints
in my head.
I'm glad
it made kevin better,
but it was still so weird.
That's actually
why we're here.
Have you been in touch
with kevin lately?
No.
I called him when i first got out
of the institution
We met for coffee,
but i haven't seen him
in months.
Is he okay?
Well,
we're not sure,
but we'd like to
talk to him.
So, if he contacts you,
would you let us know?
Well, of course.
When you find him,
will you have him call me?
Sure.
It's nice to see you
again, tess.
Bye.
I just spoke
with the program coordinator.
She says the first segment will be interviews
with some of the people you've healed
and then they'll bring you out after the break.
She says the emotional stuff also plays well
with her audience,
also plays well
with her audience,
- So feel free to cry or...
- We'll see about that.
They're also curious
about the wedding.
She'd love it if you answered
some questions...
let's keep the private life
private, okay?
Nick!
Nick, please,
wake up!
Nick!
Nick, please,
wake up!
Oh, jesus,
that's nick crowley.
Oh, my god.
You're that 4400,
the one with the hands.
Help him, please!
Nick!
Nick, wake up. Please!
If you're okay,
say something.
Well, jim morrison says hello.
Easy. Easy, boys, easy.
You just saved nick crowley.
On behalf of millions of rock and roll
burnouts all over the world,
Allow me to thank you.
Any time you want to lay these on me,
you just let me know.
It was a little bit big,
so i just had it resized.
It's perfect now.
I think, mom would be really happy,
don't you?
Lily gave you
that ring.
I guess you can do
what you want with it.
I think it's perfect.
Have you thought about what you're going to say
at the wedding?
Usually, the father of the bride gives a toast.
Um...
Well.
It's all been so sudden.
I haven't had much time
to really plan it yet.
That's okay.
I have a few thoughts.
There's an article
in this magazine on toasts.
Read it.
I think i can handle that
on my own.
Dad, i want you to read it.
Tonight.
Hi.
I bought some food.
Let me help you with that.
Thank you.
My joints
are a little stiff.
Kevin, why did you put your hood up
when i came in?
You shouldn't have to
look at me like this.
Like what?
Diana skouris and tom baldwin
came by the bookstore today.
They were asking
about you.
I figured
diana would be worried.
How did she look?
Okay, i guess.
A little sick.
Kevin, i felt bad
seeing her.
I don't like what we're doing to her...
what i'm doing to her...
I don't like it much either, but we are on the cusp
of changing the world...
For the better.
We have to keep going,
even if it gets ugly.
Kevin, it's already ugly.
Someone shot you yesterday.
I know, but the experiment is worth the risk.
They woke me up
to do this.
You woke me up
to do this.
I have to move forward.
And to do that,
i need diana.
And i need you.
Is shawn farrell around?
I have something for him.
Oh!
I played that when we were recording
my first album.
I've been holding onto it
for years.
You're really
giving this to me?
You saved my life.
Seems like a fair trade
to me.
So this, uh,
ability of yours...
it works every time
out of the gate?
Yeah, pretty much.
Oh, my god.
I wish they brought you back 15 years ago.
A career in rock 'n' roll...
sometimes it feels like
you're living in a war zone.
You lose a lot of people
along the way.
One day you look up,
and you're the last man
standing.
You should take better care
of yourself.
I'm not always around.
I feel like i owe you
more than a guitar.
We're playing tomorrow night
and i wanted to invite you
backstage.
You can hang out, watch the show
from the wings.
- Really?
- Sure.
I figure it'll be handy
having you around.
If i keel over,
you can always come out and do your "hands of god" thing
for an encore.
It's cold.
You should
bring your jacket.
She didn't say anything
on the way over?
Of course not,
kevin.
She hardly ever does.
You're so brave.
I always wanted to
give it to you first.
I thought
you deserved an ability.
I'm sorry it has to happen
without your permission.
Can i get this
started?
Give dr. Burkhoff your hand.
Mommy, I'm gonna be late for school,
if we don't leave soon.
I'm sorry, baby.
I slept through
my alarm.
I'll be ready
in a few...
Mommy,
are you okay?
I'm fine.
I just broke a nail is all.
Ew.
Ew.
Hi.
Hey, marco.
What are you doing down here?
Tom asked me to check out
dr. Burkhoff's computers.
Uh, you okay?
I heard
you had the flu.
Hey.
I thought
you were taking a sick day.
Would everyone please stop treating me
like a plague patient ?
I'm fine.
Have we learned anything
here?
Dr. Burkhoff's computers
are clean.
Like, completely clean.
I mean, there're no saved files,
no records of anything.
It's like someone took out his hard drives and swapped them
for new ones.
So either he took them
somewhere...
or someone else has them.
Diana.
Look at this.
Is that...
kevin?
Yeah.
My god.
These are the side effects
of the injections?
I haven't seen him
in a couple of weeks.
I had no idea
he'd gotten so bad.
- Think it's a self-portrait?
- No way.
Kevin's hands weren't steady enough to make coffee.
Didn't tess like to draw?
I feel like i'm in
a staring contest.
It's okay.
I know it can be a little awkward at first.
So, sometimes when i'm having trouble
getting started with a student,
I'll take their hand.
It helps everything
get rolling.
You up for it?
Yeah.
I guess.
Just relax, okay?
Hmm.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I, uh...
To be honest,
i felt a little awkward.
I, uh, i haven't had someone touch me like that
since, uh...
My wife passed, and...
it's okay.
Sometimes it takes more than one session
to make headway.
Diana?
Diana?
Should i just call you a cab?
I can handle this if you want.
No, i'm okay.
Any sign of tess?
No, she hasn't come out yet.
Look, tom.
I made an appointment with the doctor for tomorrow morning,
but, for now, i'd just like to
stick with it, okay?
I have to say,
this does not feel like the flu.
It's like
i'm dragging myself around.
Here she is.
Come in.
Hey.
What?
Different look
for you.
"Look?"
I dressed like this
for 10 years.
Hey, you're not going to ask
about the wedding, are you?
I am officially taking the night off from all planning.
This has nothing to do with the wedding
unless nick crowley's invited.
Hum, He's downstairs.
Really?
No, i'm getting ready
for his show.
Maybe he wants to give me
a ride or something.
Uh, i don't think
that's it.
Well, what?
I never get enough refills.
I mean, look at me...
What's he saying?
Nick has a prescription
for antabuse.
They're these pills
that are supposed to help him
cut back on his drinking.
He finally
tried some.
I guess
he overdid it, huh?
It's the same thing
he does with everything.
He insisted on coming here
instead of the hospital.
Do your worst.
Please?
Come to my arms,
my beamish boy.
Lie down. Lie down.
You're my little lifeline.
Kevin.
Dr. Burkhoff, i've been worried about you.
What are you doing,
hiding up here?
My god. Look at you.
Dr. Burkhoff, you need to
come with us.
We're going to get you
some help.
I can't do that. People are trying
to kill me.
What people? Who's trying
to kill you?
I think they work
for the government.
They don't work
for ntac.
Are you sure about that? Because i'm not.
Listen, kevin. You know us.
If you come in,
we'll protect you.
And, besides, i'm not taking no for an answer.
Come on.
Actually, i think
you're going to have to.
Diana? What the hell
are you doing?
I don't know, tom. I'm sorry.
Diana's not quite
herself right now.
She'll do
whatever tess wants her to.
Tess, will you get his gun, please?
Please.
I am so close to finishing.
Stop trying to find me.
I have no desire to hurt you.
Diana...
are you okay?
Are you all right?
I don't know.
What happened?
You pulled your gun
on me.
Tess?
Yeah.
 Oh, god.
What?
Something's wrong.
I just feel weird.
Oh, my god.
What are those?
They're lesions.
They're just like the ones kevin had
when he started taking promicin.
We need to get you
to ntac medical.
We wanted to bring in
If there's anything at all to these experiments
dr. Burkhoff has been conducting,
A lot of people in d.c. are going to want to
look over his notes.
These pictures have already been circulated to local law enforcement.
We're going to distribute them around the neighborhood
near dr. Burkhoff's apartment.
and the vacation home
where he was hiding.
Maybe we'll get lucky.
So, what, we're supposed to tell people
that there's some kind of monster on the loose?
No, if anyone asks,
we tell them dr. Burkhoff
has werner syndrome.
It's a rare wasting disease.
Okay.
But do you really think we'll be able to bring
this guy in safe and sound?
I mean, some cowboy cop sees this stumbling
towards him,
You don't think he might shoot first and ask questions later?
That's why we have to
get to him first.
Whatever dr. Burkhoff is guilty of, he saved thousands of lives
during the inhibitor scandal.
The good thing about his condition is,
 it shouldn't make him too hard to spot.
I don't know.
You're nice hands,
But they don't look magical
or anything.
Making friends
already?
Hey.
You've chosen
wisely.
I speak from experience.
The show was amazing.
Thank you so much
for having me.
What are you
thanking me for?
The show would've been canceled
if not for you.
Listen.
I just had the best idea during the encore.
Why don't you come out
on the road with us?
And do what?
Well, you could start
with mischa
and work your way
onward from there.
Okay, yeah, it's tempting,
but i kind of have a lot on my plate here in seattle, you know?
I'm supposed
to get married soon.
Well, in that case, you have to come with us.
It'll be like
an extended bachelor party.
We'll take good care of you.
Promise.
And a promise from mischa is money
in the bank.
Besides, i like
having you along with us.
You keep me...
limber.
You mean upright?
Well, yeah, that too.
Um, it's just
i'm not your personal physician,
you know?
Of course you're not.
You're a hell of a lot better
than any doctor i've ever met.
Oh.
Think about it.
But not too long.
What's to think about?
Who could say "no"
to all of this?
so what can i get you
this morning?
could i have
the steak and eggs?
Could you make the steak
extremely rare?
Thanks
Dr. Burkhoff was spotted at a diner in beacon hill.
He's there right now.
Bring him in quietly,
if you can,
but bring him in.
Diana, wake up.
Dr. Anapurn.
I thought i was
supposed to sleep.
You gave me drugs...
you're being
discharged.
You need to come
with me.
I don't know.
I guess he left
about 15 minutes ago.
Did he say where
he was headed?
No.
I mean, he didn't even touch the food he ordered,
right?
He just left
in a hurry.
Left a good tip,
then.
Where are we going?
Thank you.
You can go back
to your office now.
Tess,
don't do this.
I'm sorry.
I wish, it didn't have to be you,
but there's no one else.
We'd better go.
He'll be
waiting for us.
How could i have done that?
I don't remember any of it.
Diana doesn't remember going to kevin's apartment
at night, either.
If dr. Burkhoff's willing
to break her out of here,
he must be getting desperate.
Feels like
he's running out of time.
Which means he has to
complete the experiment.
He's going to up her dosage.
If we don't find diana soon, she's going to wind up
in the same shape as kevin.
I think, it's the silence that's messing us up.
It's too awkward.
So instead of us just staring
at each other,
i thought we'll talk.
Okay. Um...
is there something specific
you wanted to talk about?
No.
You pick.
Well, i've been thinking about
my parents a lot lately,
What they'd think
of all this,
This place...
Me,
Sitting here trying to
figure out how to use my...
Telekinetic ability?
You know, you can
say it out loud.
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.
Yeah, you can say that,
But when i first got back,
i was a 4400,
But i didn't have
an ability.
I felt normal.
It was something
i could hold on to.
Now you have to get used to the idea
that you're special.
Is that what my parents
would thinkif they were here?
Or would they just think that their son
had become a freak?
Richard.
When you got taken,
you were one of
the first black pilots
in all of the military.
You were at the vanguard.
Now you're part of
a different vanguard.
There's a reason
they picked you.
I think your parents
would be proud.
Yeah.
Uh...
Maybe that's true.
Richard?
Whoa.
Well, i guess
that worked, huh?
This will be fine.
We can work here
for a while.
Tell him he can go home.
Please.
You have to help me.
Say something.
Don't bother.
He's not going to remember
any of this.
Thank you.
You can
go home now.
Kevin?
Can i get you
some water?
I'm fine.
Kevin.
You're dying.
You're killing yourself.
And now you're going to kill me, too.
No.
You will not die.
My work... is valid.
Are you sure?
Look at yourself.
If it isn't working in me,
the fault isn't
with the experiment.
It's with me.
All those years, the shock treatments,
the fistfuls of medications,
they must have changed me.
I'm not a good subject.
There is no good subject.
Kevin, you're brilliant,
but you're wrong.
You failed, and you're notthinking clearly enough
to see that.
My mind is not compromised.
We are at a point, Diana,
Where it would be easy
for the timid to turn back.
We have to be braver
than that.
And, if necessary...
Oh. No...
Oh...
i'm prepared to be brave enough
for both of us.
Working on a song?
The end of one.
Can't nail it, though.
Inspiration.
Are you shocked
i'm drinking my lunch?
I didn't say anything.
Good, because this is...
listen...
this here is called
"maintaining a base level."
That's kind of scary, actually.
Shawn.
Don't worry.
I've made a solemn vow
not to over-indulge...
unless, of course,
you're around.
Yeah, that's kind of the thing.
You're not going to be around,
is that it?
You're not coming on the road?
I wanted to.
It's just...
you know, even if it was
for a little while.
This gift i have, though,
it's kind of
a responsibility, you know?
And i don't mean
to be harsh, man,
but i don't think
it was meant to be used
As a rock star's personal safety net.
You don't know that.
Maybe they sent you back
to keep me alive
So i could finish my album.
Nick, if you go down again...
i can't be there for you.
There's still time,
you know.
We can save him.
I think maybe you don't have
enough faith in kevin.
He can do this.
He's special.
That's why
they had me wake him up.
Tess?
I packed an adrenaline shot
when we left the cabin.
Have you seen it?
No.
I need it.
It has to be here
in case i slip under.
Ah.
Kevin?
I think i got stung
by a bee.
What is this?
Don't move, dr. Burkhoff!
- Tess?
- There'snowhere to go.
We've got this place
surrounded.
Nobody fire.
He's not going anywhere.
Diana,
are you all right?
Tom.
Whoa.
Hold still, burkhoff.
Put your hands up.
Burkhoff!
They won't be able
to hide for long.
Tess will run out of meds.
Dr. Burkhoff
is not exactly inconspicuous.
They'll show themselves,
we'll find them.
You mean we'll find tess.
It doesn't sound like
burkhoff will live out the week.
I don't get it.
He was supposed to be
the father of 4400 technology.
That's why they woke him up.
Well, that's
just our theory.
Maybe you're putting
too much faith in the future.
Diana's okay?
Yeah,
she'll get there.
She's down
in ntac medical.
You got us a ride.
Someone
let me borrow them.
Mr. Ryland wants a status report
on the promicin.
We're good.
Great, actually.
We have enough of a stockpile to last us
for almost two years.
Transcript : Team FRM (1000fr.com)
Synchro : Liukan, Benj!
We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
You're so sWeet,
I wish I could take you with me
when I go, but I can't.
So yesterday, a few patients
were compelled to work on this thing.
And today, it's the entire hospital.
If we get Tess out of here,
do you think this compulsion will fade?
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.
I Will have taught my body
hoW to produce promicin,
And then I will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.
Enough running, Dr. Burkhoff.
You need to come with us now.
No. Stay back.
I don't wanna hurt anyone.
That's very reassuring.
We'll keep that in mind.
No! No! No!
Mr. Tyler.
Come in. What can I do for you?
I wanted to ask you about your work
with the students here.
Sure. I teach three classes.
- History, arts and--
- I'm not talking about your teaching.
I was talking about the counseling
that you do.
I understand you use your ability
with the kids.
That's right.
My ability is to help them focus
their abilities.
It's pretty much what I've been doing
ever since I came back.
If a student has a talent,
like all of our kids here do,
I help them learn how to use it.
Gain control of it.
Build their confidence.
Does it work with adults?
It didn't use to, but I haven't tried it
since I've been off the inhibitor. Why?
I developed this ability
a few months ago.
Telekinesis.
What a word. I can't even say it
with a straight face.
- Oh, that's fantastic.
- I've just been pretending it isn't there.
I mean, I know a little bit about it.
So far, it only works
with inanimate objects.
Little stuff.
And when I'm mad or excited,
I can do a lot more with it.
And you're looking
to control it when you're calm?
Yeah. That's why I'm here, I guess.
How many times do I have
to go over this with you people?
I have not been injecting promicin
into anyone but myself.
You're certain of that?
You're a world-class scientist.
I find it difficult to believe
you wouldn't build a redundancy plan
into your experiment.
This isn't your basic sleep study.
I mean, look at me.
Do you think I'd have an easy time
finding volunteers?
No, I do not.
You look like you're in quite a bit
of discomfort to me.
Yes.
- As a matter of fact, I am.
- Well, you can relax now.
The experiment's over.
This will only hurt a minute.
Bag him.
We'll take him back for the autopsy.
Get Dr. Burkhoff up there quickly.
We promised results by the morning.
Mommy?
Mommy? Mom? Are you okay?
Of course, sweetie. I'm fine.
Why wouldn't I be?
I had a bad dream. You were in it.
Well, why don't you get in
and tell me about it?
You turned into a monster.
It was horrible.
It seemed so real.
It was you, but you were different.
What kind of a monster?
Nice. Something
for the refrigerator door?
You don't think
there's anything to this?
It's not a prediction, right?
Just a bad dream.
Well, I hope so.
But when your daughter is a precog,
you don't want her giving you
a picture like this.
Hello, this is Skouris.
Well, thank you for calling me back.
- Let me know if you see him, all right?
- Everything okay?
Maybe. I'm not sure.
I mean, that was the 4400 Center.
I was hoping maybe they'd seen
Dr. Burkhoff.
I stopped by his apartment yesterday,
and he wasn't home.
Diana, why would you be stopping
by Dr. Burkhoff's apartment?
You actually saw the wound
in Kevin's hand heal over?
Yes. He pulled the scalpel out,
and it was gone within seconds.
He's developing an ability.
I mean, he's close to it anyway.
He says it comes and goes.
What?
Anyone else developing a 4400 ability
I should know about?
- I should have told you earlier.
- You're damn right you should have.
Gotta hand it to you, Diana.
Some people play racquetball
in their spare time,
maybe collect old records, but you,
you play lgor to the one man who...
Well, if he has developed an ability
like you say,
maybe he really is the father
of 4400 technology.
Just like the future predicted.
Are you two the only ones
who know about this experiment?
I thought we were.
And now I'm not so sure.
And that's what I'm worried about.
Tom, what if someone else finds out
what he's up to?
Well, if he succeeds,
we could be talking about the mass
marketing of 4400 abilities.
I'm sure a lot of people would like
to keep that genie in the bottle.
Make our jobs even easier.
Are you--? Are you okay?
Yeah, it's just my allergies.
They're acting up.
I've already spoken to his family. They
haven't heard from him in months.
Okay, so who else is he close to?
"'l didn't know that Cheshire cats
always grinned.
In fact, I didn't know cats could grin,"
said Alice very politely.
"'You don't know much,"
said the duchess.
"And that's a fact."
We'll finish this chapter tomorrow.
I hope you all can make it.
I've been living in a halfway house
for about three months.
And I got this job here
two weeks ago.
Well, that's great, Tess.
So they found a medication
that works for you?
Well, so far, so good.
I still have my disease.
Schizophrenia never goes away.
But I haven't had any symptoms
for a while.
Hopefully, I won't.
So these kids you're reading to,
they're not going to try and build
a tower to contact the future, are they?
I don't think so.
I can barely remember all that now.
I'm still not sure how I could
compel people to work
or why they put those blueprints
in my head.
I'm glad it made Kevin better.
But it was still so weird.
That's actually why we're here.
Have you been in touch
with Kevin lately?
No. I called him when I first got out
of the institution, but...
We met for coffee...
I haven't seen him in months.
Is he okay?
Well, we're not sure,
but we'd like to talk to him.
So if he contacts you,
would you let us know?
Of course.
When you find him,
will you have him call me?
Sure. It's nice to see you again, Tess.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I just spoke with the program
coordinator.
She says the first segment
will be interviews
with some of the people you've healed.
And then they'll bring you out
after the break.
She says the emotional stuff
also plays well with her audience,
so feel free to cry or...
We'll see about that.
They're also kind of curious
about the wedding.
She'd love it if you answered
some questions.
Let's keep the private life
private, okay?
Nick! Nick, please wake up!
Nick! Nick, please wake up!
Jesus, that's Nick Crowley.
Oh, my God. You're that 4400.
The one with the hands.
Help him, please! Nick!
Nick, wake up, please.
- Is he all right?
- If you're okay, say something.
Well, Jim Morrison says hello.
Easy, easy, boys, easy.
Coming up...
You just saved Nick Crowley.
On behalf of millions of rock 'n' roll
burnouts all over the world,
allow me to thank you.
Any time you wanna lay these on me,
you just let me know.
It was a little bit big,
so I just had it resized.
It's perfect now.
I think Mom would be really happy,
don't you?
Lily gave you that ring.
I guess you can do
what you want with it.
I think it's perfect.
So have you thought about what
you're going to say at the wedding?
Usually, the father of the bride
gives a toast.
Well, it's all been so sudden.
I haven't had much time
to really plan it yet.
That's okay. I have a few thoughts.
There's an article in this magazine
on toasts.
Read it.
I think I can handle that on my own.
Dad, I want you to read it. Tonight.
Hi.
I bought some food.
Let me help you with that.
Thank you. My joints are a little stiff.
Kevin, why did you put your hood up
when I came in?
You shouldn't have to look at me
like this.
Like what?
Diana Skouris and Tom Baldwin
came by the bookstore today.
They were asking about you.
I figured Diana would be worried.
How did she look?
Okay, I guess.
A little sick.
Kevin, I felt bad seeing her.
I don't like what we're doing to her.
- What I'm doing to her.
- I don't like it much either.
But we are on the cusp
of changing the world for the better.
We have to keep going,
even if it gets ugly.
Kevin, it's already ugly.
Someone shot you yesterday.
I know.
But the experiment is worth the risk.
They woke me up to do this.
You woke me up to do this.
I have to move forward.
And to do that, I need Diana.
And I need you.
Is Shawn Farrell around?
I have something for him.
I played that when we were recording
my first album.
I've been holding on to it for years.
You're really giving this to me?
You saved my life.
Seems like a fair trade to me.
So this ability of yours.
It works every time out of the gate?
Yeah, pretty much.
Oh, my God.
I wish they'd brought you back
1 5 years ago.
Career in rock 'n' roll...
Sometimes it feels like
you're living in a war zone.
You lose a lot of people along the way.
One day you look up,
and you're the last man standing.
You should take better care
of yourself. I'm not always around.
I feel like I owe you
more than a guitar.
We're playing tomorrow night,
and I wanted to invite you backstage.
You can hang out,
watch the show from the wings.
- Really?
- Sure.
I figure it'll be handy
having you around.
If I keel over,
you can always come out
and do your hands of God thing
for an encore.
It's cold.
You should bring your jacket.
She didn't say anything
on the way over?
Of course not, Kevin.
She hardly ever does.
You're so brave.
I always wanted to give it to you first.
I thought you deserved an ability.
I'm sorry it has to happen
without your permission.
Can we get this started?
Give Dr. Burkhoff your hand.
Mommy, I'm gonna be late for school
if we don't leave soon.
I'm sorry, baby.
I slept through my alarm.
I'll be ready in a few--
Mommy, are you okay?
I'm fine. I just broke a nail is all.
Hi.
Hey, Marco.
What are you doing down here?
Tom asked me to check out
Dr. Burkhoff's computers.
Are you okay?
- I heard you had the flu.
- No.
Hey, I thought you were taking
a sick day.
Everyone, please, stop treating me
like a plague patient.
I'm fine.
Have we learned anything here?
Dr. Burkhoff's computers
are clean. Like, completely clean.
I mean, there's no saved files,
no records of anything.
It's like someone took out
his hard drives
and swapped them for new ones.
- So either he took them somewhere...
- Or someone else has them.
Diana...
...Iook at this.
Is that Kevin?
Yeah.
My God, these are the side effects
of the injections?
I haven't seen him in a couple
of weeks.
I had no idea he'd gotten so bad.
So who drew this?
You think it's a self-portrait?
No way. Kevin's hands weren't
steady enough to make coffee.
Didn't Tess like to draw?
I feel like I'm in a staring contest.
It's okay.
I know it can be
a little awkward at first.
So sometimes when I'm having trouble
getting started with a student,
I'll take their hand.
It helps everything get rolling.
You up for it?
Yeah. I guess.
Just relax, okay?
I'm sorry, l...
To be honest,
I felt a little awkward.
I haven't had someone touch me
like that since...
...my wife passed.
It's okay.
Sometimes it takes more
than one session to make headway.
Diana?
Diana?
Should I just call you a cab?
I can handle this if you want.
No, I'm okay.
Any sign of Tess?
No, she hasn't come out yet.
Look, Tom, I made an appointment
with the doctor tomorrow morning.
But for now,
I'd just like to stick with it, okay?
I have to say,
this does not feel like the flu.
It's like I'm dragging myself around.
Here she is.
Come in.
Hey.
What?
Different look for you.
New look?
I dressed like this for ten years.
Hey, you're not here to ask
about the wedding, are you?
I am officially taking the night off
from all planning.
This has nothing to do
with the wedding,
unless Nick Crowley's invited.
He's downstairs.
Really? I'm getting ready
for his show.
Maybe he wants to give me a ride
or something.
I don't think that's it.
Well, what?
I never get enough refills.
I mean, look at me.
- Where is he staying...?
- What's he saying?
Nick has a prescription
for Antabuse.
They're these pills that are supposed
to help him cut back on his drinking.
He finally tried some.
I guess he overdid it, huh?
It's the same thing he does
with everything.
He insisted on coming here
instead of the hospital.
Continue medicine for me.
Do your worst.
Please?
Come to my arms,
my beamish boy.
Lay down. Lay down.
You're my little lifeline.
Kevin.
Dr. Burkhoff,
I've been worried about you.
What are you doing hiding up here?
My God, look at you.
Dr. Burkhoff,
you need to come with us.
We're gonna get you some help.
I can't do that.
People are trying to kill me.
What people?
Who's trying to kill you?
I think they work for the government.
No, they don't work for NTAC.
Are you sure about that?
Because I'm not.
Listen, Kevin, you know us.
If you come in, we'll protect you.
Besides, I'm not taking no
for an answer. Come on.
Actually, I think
you're going to have to.
- Diana, what the hell are you doing?
- I don't know, Tom. I'm sorry.
Diana is not quite herself right now.
She'll do whatever Tess tells her to.
Tess, would you get his gun, please?
Please. I am so close to finishing.
Stop trying to find me.
I have no desire to hurt you.
Diana.
Are you okay? You all right?
I don't know. What happened?
You pulled your gun on me.
- Tess.
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.
- What?
Something's wrong.
I feel weird.
Oh, my God. What are those?
They're lesions.
They're just like the ones Kevin had
when he started taking promicin.
We need to get you to NTAC medical.
We want him brought in unharmed.
If there's anything at all
to these experiments
Dr. Burkhoff has been conducting,
a lot of people in D.C. are gonna
want to look over his notes.
These pictures have already been
circulated to local law enforcement.
We're gonna distribute them
around the neighborhood
near Dr. Burkhoff's apartment
and the vacation home
where he was hiding.
- Maybe we'll get lucky.
- So, what?
We tell people there's some kind of
monster on the loose?
No, if anyone asks, we tell them
Dr. Burkhoff has Werner's syndrome.
- It's a rare wasting disease.
- Okay.
You think we're gonna be able
to bring this guy in safe and sound?
I mean, some cowboy cop
sees this stumbling towards him,
you don't think he might shoot first
and ask questions later?
That's why we have to get to him first.
Whatever Dr. Burkhoff is guilty of,
he saved thousands of lives
during the inhibitor scandal.
Look, the good thing
about his condition
is it shouldn't make him
too hard to spot.
I don't know.
They're nice hands,
but they don't look magical
or anything.
Making friends already?
- Hey.
- Oh, you've chosen wisely.
I speak from experience.
The show was amazing.
- Thank you so much for having me.
- What are you thanking me for?
The show would have been canceled
if not for you.
Listen, I just had the best idea
during the encore.
Why don't you come out
on the road with us?
And do what?
Well, you could start with Mischa,
and work your way onward from there.
Okay, yeah, it's tempting,
but I kind of have a lot on my plate
here in Seattle, you know?
I'm supposed to be
getting married soon.
Well, in that case,
you have to come with us.
It'll be like an extended bachelor party.
He'll take good care of you. Promise.
And a promise from Mischa
is money in the bank.
Besides, I like
having you along with us.
You keep me limber.
- You mean upright.
- Oh, yeah, that too.
I don't...
I'm not your personal physician,
you know?
Of course you're not.
You're a hell of a lot better
than any doctor I've ever met.
Think about it, but not too long.
What's to think about?
Who could say no to all of this?
So, what can I get you
this morning?
Could I have the steak and eggs?
Could you make the steak
extremely rare?
Thanks.
Dr. Burkhoff was spotted at a diner
in Beacon Hill. He's there right now.
Bring him in quietly if you can,
but bring him in.
Diana, wake up.
Dr. Anapurn.
I thought I was supposed to sleep.
You gave me drugs.
You're being discharged.
You need to come with me.
I don't know. I guess he left
about 1 5 minutes ago.
Did he say where he was headed?
No. I mean, he didn't even touch
the food he ordered, right?
He just left in a hurry.
He left a good tip though.
Where are we going?
Thank you.
You can go back to your office now.
- Tess, don't do this.
- I'm sorry.
I wish it didn't have to be you,
but there's no one else.
We better go.
He'll be waiting for us.
How could I have done that?
I don't remember any of it.
Diana doesn't remember going
to Kevin's apartment at night either.
If Dr. Burkhoff's willing
to break her out of here,
he must be getting desperate.
Feels like he's running out of time.
He has to complete
the experiment.
He's gonna up her dosage.
If we don't find Diana soon,
she's gonna wind up
in the same shape as Kevin.
I think it's the silence
that's messing us up.
It's too awkward.
So instead of us just staring
at each other, I thought we'll talk.
Okay.
Something specific
you want to talk about?
No. You pick.
Well, I've been thinking
about my parents a lot lately.
What they'd think of all this.
This place.
Me.
Sitting here trying to figure out
how to use my...
Telekinetic ability?
You know, you can say it out loud.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Yeah, you can say that,
but when I first got back,
I was a 4400,
but I didn't have an ability.
I felt normal.
It was something I could hold onto.
Now you have to get used to the idea
that you're special.
Is that what my parents would think
if they were here?
Or would they just think
that their son had become a freak?
Richard, when you got taken,
you were one of the first black pilots
in all of the military.
You were at the vanguard.
Now you're part of a different
vanguard.
There's a reason they picked you.
I think your parents would be proud.
Yeah?
Maybe that's true.
Richard?
Well, I guess that worked, huh?
This will be fine.
We can work here for a while.
Tell him he can go home.
Please, you gotta help me.
Say something.
Don't bother.
He's not going to remember
any of this.
Thank you. You can go home now.
Kevin, can I get you some water?
No.
- I'm fine.
- Kevin, you're dying.
You're killing yourself,
and now you're gonna kill me too.
No.
You will not die.
My work is valid.
Are you sure?
Look at yourself.
If it isn't working in me,
the fault isn't with the experiment.
It's with me.
All those years of shock treatments,
the fistfuls of medications.
They must have changed me.
I'm not a good subject.
There is no good subject.
Kevin, you're brilliant,
but you're wrong.
You failed, and you're not thinking
clearly enough to see that.
My mind is not compromised.
We are at a point, Diana,
where it would be easy
for the timid to turn back.
We have to be braver than that.
And if necessary...
... I'm prepared to be brave enough
for both of us.
Working on a song?
The end of one. Can't nail it though.
Inspiration.
What? Are you shocked
I'm drinking my lunch?
- I didn't say anything.
- Good.
- Because--
- Listen--
This here is called
maintaining a base level.
It's kind of scary, actually.
Shawn, don't worry.
I've made a solemn vow
not to overindulge,
unless, of course, you're around.
Yeah, that's kind of the thing.
You're not going to be around,
is that it?
You're not coming on the road?
I wanted to. It's just...
I mean, even if
it was for a little while.
This gift I have, though,
it's kind of a responsibility, you know?
And I don't mean to be harsh, man,
but I don't think it was meant
to be used
as a rock star's personal safety net.
You don't know that.
Maybe they sent you back
to keep me alive
so I could finish my album.
Nick, if you go down again...
... I can't be there for you.
There's still time, you know.
We can save him.
I think maybe you don't have
enough faith in Kevin.
He can do this.
He's special,
that's why they had me wake him up.
Tess, I packed an adrenaline shot
when we left the cabin.
- Have you seen it?
- No.
I need it.
It has to be here in case I slip under.
Kevin?
I think I got stung by a bee.
What is this?
Don't move, Dr. Burkhoff!
- Tess.
- There's nowhere to go.
We've got this place surrounded.
Nobody fires.
He's not going anywhere.
Hey, Diana. Are you all right?
Tom.
Hold still, Burkhoff.
Put your hands up.
Burkhoff!!
They won't be able to hide for long.
Tess will run out of meds.
Dr. Burkhoff's not exactly
inconspicuous.
They'll show themselves,
we'll find them.
You mean we'll find Tess.
Doesn't sound like Dr. Burkhoff's
gonna live out the week.
I don't get it.
He was supposed to be the father
of 4400 technology.
That's why they woke him up.
Well, that's just our theory.
Maybe you're putting too much faith
in the future.
Diana's okay?
Yeah, she'll get there.
She's down in NTAC medical.
You got us a ride.
Someone let me borrow them.
Mr. Ryland wants a status report
on the promicin.
We're good. Great, actually.
We have enough of a stockpile
to last us for almost two years.
over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted
all at once they were returned
with no memory of
where they've been
they haven't aged a day
and some have returned
with new abilities
all are trying to reconnect...
...with a life interrupted
<i>We're not a threat.
We're salvation.</i>
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>
okay, we're clear, right?
It's over
between the two of us.
You once told me
that good and evil was a choice,
and i'm afraid if i lose you
i'm going to make the wrong one.
Welcome to haspelcorp.
How may i help you?
Hi.
I have an appointment
with dennis ryland.
Learning anything new?
Yeah.
She's incredible.
In a week,
we've made discoveries
we thought
it would take years
to get to.
Isabelle, i don't love you.
Shawn, you and i are
the two most powerful people
on the planet.
We have to get married.
[Richard]:
I knew she was different.
Dangerous.
[Gasps]
You can't kill me, shawn.
Richard, if i believed
that staying with isabelle
would save all those lives,
i would marry her tomorrow,
but what happens
if she gets tired of me,
or i make her angry?
There are things
i was sent here to do.
Brutal things.
[Shawn]: I don't know
how you can know that,
but it doesn't
have to happen that way.
We need to be together,
because i think
you're the only one
who can stop me.

Looking for a date?
Not you.
Him.
[Sighs]
Tim.
You've got a customer.
[Engine turns over]
So it's 40 bucks,
if you want
to get started.
I just want
to look at you
for a second.
Do you have any idea
how special you are?
You don't, do you?
Look, we can talk
if you want to,
but it's still 40 bucks.
Timothy winters mccarren.
You're going to
change the world.
How'd you know my name?
It's true.
You're going to
change everything...
unless i stop you.
That's it. I'm out of here.
[Rattles door handle]
Come on, man. Let me out.
I'm serious.
[Screams]
[Screaming]
[Man]:
I rolled that myself.
It's my way
of saying thank you
for inviting me
to your wedding.
Well, thank you,
but you didn't have to.
Isabelle and i
invited every 4400.
I wouldn't have missed it.
I'm quite excited.
You must be, too.
The ceremony's so close.
Uh-huh.
Four days.
I have to offer you
a word of caution.
The cigar...
when you smoke it,
you might be surprised
by its effects.
Oh, i'm not going to
get arrested
for having this,
am i?
[Chuckling]:
Of course not.
About a year
after we returned,
i learned i have an ability.
When i come in contact
with a person,
they sometimes see a vision
of their future.
I see nothing,
understand...
only those i touch...
but i'm told
it can be quite accurate.
That's a nice talent.
Thank you.
I grew this tobacco
myself.
It's been in contact
with my hands,
and so it contains my ability.
Wait, so,
what you're saying is
if i smoke this cigar,
i'm going to
see the future?
Your future.
A possible one,
anyway.
As i said,
use with caution.
You might not like
what you see,
but it seems
an appropriate gift
for a man
on his wedding day.
Well, it is better
than a toaster oven.
Thank you, claudio.
My congratulations
to you.
The centerpieces
are amazing.
You should take a look.
Uh, yeah, sure,
after we're done
with these meet-and-greets,
though, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, you taking up smoking?
[Door opens]
This is edwin garrett
and his wife, denise.
They came all the way
from edinburgh
to be here.
Thank you so much
for coming.
The guy's name
was tim mccarren.
He was a hustler.
Worked an area of the park
not far from here.
I found his body
just after sunrise.
Now, i've already
interviewed
his colleagues,
and they say he got
into a pickup truck
with a man in his 20s
at about 1:30 last night.
One of the other
working boys
got a real decent look
at the driver.
So you could probably
sit him down
with a sketch artist.
Probably could,
but you do realize
we're not homicide cops,
right?
We're from ntac.
So why'd you call us?
That's why.

My best guess?
His body
was completely oxidized.
It's a chemical reaction.
Cells change
at the molecular level.
Oxidizing?
That's what happens
when metal rusts.
Exactly.
Well, almost exactly.
Rusting is
a slow process.
There's nothing gradual
about what happened
to tim mccarren.
One minute he was alive,
the next...
have you ever seen
anything like this before?
No.
There's no
documented disease
that affects
the human body this way.
Meaning a 4400 ability did this.
That's for you to figure out.
All i can tell you
is there's no...
earthly explanation
about what happened
to this guy.
Thanks.
So nothing
even close?
Okay.
Thanks, brian.
That was the lab.
They ran
the composite sketch
of the driver
against our database
of 4400s.
No matches.
Anything
from forensics?
No.
They pulled a couple
of partial prints
off the safety pin
that held the note
to the kid's jacket,
but nothing we can
make an i.d. From.
Okay, what about the note?
It's a deliberate message
to whoever found the body.
That's typical
of a serial killer
pathology.
Yeah,
but it says "27."
There can't be
26 other corpses
like tim mccarren's
out there.
Even one would make it
onto our radar.
So we'll talk
to mccarren's friends,
families...
maybe he's got
a connection to a 4400.
Diana...
there is
one other thing
i want to
talk to you about.
You got plans on sunday?
Y-you want me to go
to shawn's wedding...
with you?
It's not a date, okay?
I figured you might be
interested.
Almost a thousand 4400s
are coming.
Oh, so it's
a professional courtesy.
Yeah, that's one way to put it.
Look, to be honest,
i'd rather not be the only one
sitting at the ntac table.
You'd have a hard time
finding a dance partner.
Look, you know,
maia begged me to go,
and i told her no.
All those 4400s in one place...
we have no idea
what could happen.
Diana, it's shawn and isabelle.
Nobody's going to cause
any trouble.
I mean, would you want to be
on the bride's bad side?
I can't imagine you're eager
to welcome that girl
into the family.
I'm not...
this all happened
a little too quickly
for my liking...
but shawn won't talk to me
about it.
I must have left him
20 messages.
I was thinking
about going to see him
after we finish work today.
Just make sure
bridezilla is out of earshot.
I have to.
"Have to"?
You're about to
get married, shawn.
You should want to.
What's going on?
is she...
is she pregnant?
No, no,
nothing like that.
Is she forcing you?
Look, shawn,
if you're
feeling trapped,
if you're looking
for a way out of this,
just tell me.
I can help.
"Help"?
I'm not in front
of a firing squad.
I'm getting married.
People do it all the time.
Come on, shawn.
You're marrying isabelle.
She's a very dangerous girl.
I happen to know that.
Okay, i know all about her, too,
so don't think
you're going to surprise me.
I appreciate
you coming down here,
i know you mean well,
but this marriage,
it is the right thing.
The right thing for who?
For everybody.
They just cannot
keep anything working
around here.
This always happens
when i work late.
You know,
i don't even know
where the stairs are
in this place.
Right down here.
Come on. I'll show you.
So, do you always
work past 8:00?
Most nights, yeah.
Trying to get ahead,
you know?
Dedication.
I like that.
You could accomplish
great things.
Her name
was paula nakata.
She was a lawyer
at a firm in the building.
My god.
The poor woman.
That's two bodies
in less than 24 hours.
It doesn't
make any sense.
Most spree killers,
they have a type,
but tim mccarren
and paula nakata
could hardly be more different.
A prostitute
and a corporate attorney.
Why would someone
target these two?
And why is she labeled "11"?
The numbers on the bodies
are working backwards.
It looks like we might have
a partial print
on the wedding band.
It's probably from the victim,
but you never know.
Let's hope
whoever did this
slipped up,
because i don't think
he's anywhere close
to finished yet.
We were so close.
We were going to
save everything.
Isabelle changed you.
You don't even...
know who you are anymore.
She didn't change me.
She showed me who i am.
I know myself
better than ever,
and i know exactly
what has to happen here.
Don't do this.
[Gasps]
[Rasping]: Shawn...
[coughs]
Marco?
Did you go home
last night?
Uh... no.
Uh, i was working
on your case.
It got late.
Cold.
We had a message
you wanted
to talk to us.
Uh, yeah.
The print that they pulled
from paula nakata's
wedding band
wasn't hers.
Does it match the one
we found on tim mccarren's body?
It does indeed.
The print belongs
to a man named
darren piersahl.
Piersahl?
I never heard of him.
I'm not surprised.
See...
he is not a 4400.
Well, then he's not
the murderer.
Marco, you saw both bodies.
A 4400 killed these people.
It certainly looks that way,
but the fingerprint match
wasn't from
our database.
It was from
u.s. Military records.
Piersahl was
an army ranger
for seven years.
"Was"?
What's he doing now?
Not much.
According
to army records,
darren piersahl is dead.
He was killed in action
in iraq in 2005.
I'm wondering...
how could
an army sergeant
who's supposedly
been dead for a year
be using a 4400 ability
darren always wanted to be
a ranger.
It was his dream,
ever since he was old enough
to read.
I encouraged it.
I spent 20 years
in the service myself,
so when darren signed up,
it was like carrying on
the family legacy.
Why is ntac
so interested
in my son's death,
anyway?
It's part of an ongoing
investigation, mr. Piersahl.
Please,
anything you could tell us
would help.
Not long before he died,
i got a letter from darren.
He was excited.
Said he'd been accepted
into this elite training unit.
He couldn't tell me
much about it,
just that it meant
he was being transferred
off the front lines
and out of harm's way.
And he was
killed in action
soon after that?
Two weeks later.
The army told me
he'd been flying
a recon mission
in an oh-58 helicopter.
It got hit with an rpg.
They never did
find his remains.
I'm so sorry,
mr. Piersahl...
but you said
the army "told you"
he was flying a recon mission.
Did you have any reason
to doubt that?
Well, i thought the timing
was peculiar.
I mean,
i just got this letter from him
saying he was done fighting,
so i did some checking.
There were six soldiers
reported dead
in the crash that killed my son.
And why is that unusual?
Because an oh-58 flies
with a crew of four.
It can't hold six people.
A secret training program?
A death under suspicious
circumstances?
There's something off here.
Even the kid's dad
knows it.
It's weird...
i'm not denying it...
but let's just take
our time with this, okay?
There are explanations
that don't involve
a cover-up.
Someone could have planted
darren piersahl's
fingerprints
at the crime scene.
Who knows?
It could be a 4400.
Someone who can mimic
other people's
fingerprints.
Maybe...
[cell phone ringing]
But if you were
trying to frame someone,
why would you pick a dead man?
Baldwin.
Where?
We'll be right in.
They just found another body.
[Clinking]
I'll let you all in
on a little family secret.
My brother and i haven't always
seen eye to eye,
so we didn't talk
for a while.
I went to college,
he became
the most famous person
in the world...
but it's all good,
because he's a great guy,
and i'm really proud of him.
I think we all are.
So...
congratulations, man.
I couldn't be happier
to see you walk the plank.
[Group]: Congratulations.
Cheers.
Is there anything
you'd like to say, daddy?
[Glass clinking]
Toast.
The father of the bride
wants to speak.
Uh...
shawn...
isabelle...
i have to say,
i had my doubts...
but my daughter
has managed
to overcome them.
She was determined
to make this marriage
happen,
and here we all are.
Shawn, she couldn't have picked
a better partner.
I'm proud to call you my son.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
So...
where you going
on your honeymoon?
Well, we haven't really
figured that out yet.
If you'll all please
excuse me...
stay.
You keep charming your in-laws.
I'll see what's up.
Isabelle...
oh.
You saw me die?
You're sure?
I killed you,
and richard,
i swear to god,
it looked like
i was enjoying it.
The whole reason
that i'm marrying isabelle
is to keep her attached,
normal...
that's not what happens.
I don't make her
more human.
She makes me less human.
Listen, i have to try something.
I have to go.
I have to see
if it changes anything.
You're going to walk out
on the wedding?
Maybe. I don't know.
I'm... i'm getting out of here,
and then i'm going to see
what happens.
If you leave now,
it's not going to make isabelle
very happy.
It might not be that easy
to come back.
I know that,
but i have to do it.
Just...
tell them i'm sick
or something.
I'm sorry.
Just tell them
something, okay?
Her name was holly martins.
She was a housewife
in madison park.
The pool man found her body.
Was there a note?
"92"?
How many people
is this guy targeting?
[Knock on door]
Guys, i figured out
what all these corpses
have in common.
All the victims
had the same mutation?
We did a genetic workup
on all three corpses.
Every one of them
has a slight alteration
of the 11th chromosome.
It's called
the starzl mutation.
That could be a coincidence.
Not likely.
The starzl mutation
is extremely rare.
The only documented cases
are in the seattle area.
See, there's two kinds
of mutations.
Some occur naturally.
You know, something goes wrong
when the body
is building itself.
Others are induced.
The genes are changed
by external factors.
The starzl mutation is induced.
That's right.
Starting in 1969,
seattle presbyterian hospital
used a flawed radiation machine
to treat their cancer patients.
The microswitches
that controlled
the thing
weren't working,
so the dosages were all off.
How long
did this go on?
Just under five years.
Once the hospital
figured out
what they were doing,
they tested everyone
who had ever been
exposed to it.
In some cases,
the radiation induced
a small mutation.
The starzl mutation.
Yeah, they named it
after the company
that made the bad machine.
And the mutation's replicable.
People who got it
passed it on
to their kids,
which includes...
our three victims.
But they were all living
normal lives.
They were healthy.
Just like most mutations,
you can have it
and not even know.
After everything
went public,
the lawyers
came out to play.
There was
a class-action lawsuit.
Seattle presbyterian paid
a huge settlement
to everyone who was
affected by the machine.
They almost went bankrupt.
So darren piersahl,
who's supposed to be dead,
is targeting carriers
of the starzl mutation,
which only occurs
around seattle,
and has absolutely no effect
on its carriers.
Okay, but why?
Excellent question.
When you find out,
make sure you tell me.
If there was a lawsuit,
there's a paper trail.
I bet you that hospital
keeps a master list
of everyone they paid.
[Shawn grunting with effort]
[Gasping]
You okay?
Shawn...
you have to stop healing me.
No, you're going to make it,
uncle tommy.
No, shawn, i'm not.
This is all my fault.
I should never
have talked you
out of marrying
isabelle.
No, that was my decision,
not yours.
I can't help thinking
that it didn't
have to end this way.
Everyone we love is dead.
I'm sorry.
The catastrophe is here.
Hey...
no, no, no.
Hold on, hold on,
hold on...
hold on...
[choking]
No! Let me go.
Let me go!
Save as many as you can, shawn.
You're lucky.
Until six weeks ago,
i hadn't pulled that file
in years.
If you'd asked me then,
it would have taken me hours
to find it.
What happened
six weeks ago?
Some guy in a suit
showed up.
He had a document with him
saying that the military
needed the file
for, uh, research
in the war on terror.
Yeah, there we go.
There it is.
That's the master list
of everyone we paid
in the starzl case.
This man,
can you tell me his name?
Yeah...
miles enright.
Why? You know him?
Not yet.
There's 123 people here.
123 people we know have
the starzl mutation.
And the numbers
we've been finding
on the dead bodies
correspond to where
they appear on the list.
Number 27, timothy mccarren.
Number 11, paula nakata.
And holly martins, 92.
So darren piersahl,
if he's the killer,
is working from the same list
we're holding.
But the order seems so random.
I mean, is he just killing them
as the opportunity arises,
or is there some method?
I'll try
and find a pattern.
Hey, um...
how's maia been?
She's okay.
She asks about you a lot.
Yeah?
I just checked out
miles enright.
He's a vice president
of research and development
at haspelcorp.
Dennis.
You've been
ignoring our calls.
I'm busy, tom.
Why don't you go
through my assistant?
Maybe we can talk
next week or so.
It's important,
ryland.
It's about darren piersahl,
and your company's program
to create a division
of the u.s. Military
with 4400 abilities.
I don't know, tom.
I've been working here
less than three months.
I still don't know where
the supply closets are,
and now you've got me
heading up a covert program
where i'm injecting promicin
into united states soldiers?
Six weeks ago,
the vice president
of research and development
acquired a list of everyone
with the starzl mutation.
Miles enright.
Maybe you know him?
Sorry. It's a big building.
I haven't met everybody yet.
Three people are dead.
Now, you need to tell us
everything you know
about darren piersahl
so we can bring him in
before he kills anyone else.
I've never heard of him,
and i've certainly
never heard of this...
what do you call it?
"Starzl mutation"?
This is your last chance
to cooperate
before we find piersahl.
If you help us now,
we'll make it look better
for your company later, dennis.
Well, how can i help you
when i have no idea
what you're talking about?
Now, if this program
existed...
and please understand,
i'm not saying it does...
you seem to think
that people would be shocked
to know that
it's out there.
Me, i think
they'd be grateful.
I think any good citizen
would be thankful
that his government
was working on this,
because you can be damn sure
our enemies are.
If everyone would be so happy,
why not just tell us about it?
As usual,
you have no idea
of what the stakes are.
Whoever controls
promicin
has a strategic
advantage
over the rest
of the world.
This is
another manhattan project, tom,
and they didn't close it down
because a couple of technicians
got radiation poisoning.
They kept on working,
and they were right
to do that.
It's made the world
a better place.
Not that you're admitting
that the program exists, right?
What program?
So if i go through
with it,
if i marry isabelle,
you and i
become enemies.
I kill you.
If i don't do it...
richard,
things are even worse.
People are dead.
A lot of people.
In the second vision,
your uncle said
that the catastrophe was here,
right?
The place looked
like a war zone.
What the hell
am i supposed to do?
Look, you can only deal
with the information you have.
In one future, i die.
In another,
it sounds like
thousands of people,
maybe millions,
are at risk.
That's no choice at all.
We're talking about your life.
The guy said each vision
was one possible future.
If you do marry
isabelle...
at least
we're going into it
with our eyes open.
Now that we know
what could happen,
we can change things.
Nothing's inevitable, right?
Let's hope not...
because believe me...
i don't want to die.
Meet staff sergeant
john shaffner.
Okay, so why are we meeting him?
He was one
of six fatalities
in the helicopter crash
that "killed" darren piersahl.
A helicopter
that seated only four.
Right.
Turns out john shaffner's family
never received his remains
either.
You know, there was really
a helicopter crash
that day in iraq,
but four families
got their kids' bodies back,
and two didn't,
so here's what i'm thinking...
you think piersahl
and shaffner
were recruited into
haspelcorp's training program
at the same time.
So they used the crash
to fake two deaths,
so that piersahl
and shaffner
could disappear
into the program
with impunity.
So we have a second member
of haspelcorp's program,
which is great,
but it doesn't get us
any closer
to darren piersahl.
Good point.
It doesn't, really.
Not until...
you look
at shaffner's dog tags.
This is shaffner's
military serial number.
Look familiar?
Should it?
27.
That's what the note we found
on tim mccarren said.
That's also where
we found his name
on the list of people
with the starzl mutation.
11.
That was paula nakata's number.
And holly martins
was 92 on the list.
There is a pattern.
He's picking the order
based on his buddy's
serial number.
Okay, but why?
Maybe it's a message,
maybe they're
doing it together,
but if he's consistent,
the next victim
will be number 38
on the starzl list.
Alex messina.
I already
checked him out.
He manages a bike store
in madrona.
Yeah, i recognize him.
He was in here
earlier today.
Did he say
anything to you?
It was kind of weird, actually.
He asked me if my name
was alex messina,
and he said it
like that.
You know,
the full name?
He wanted to know
if i could come out
and take a look at his bike.
He needed
to replace a part.
I told him
just to bring it in.
He said he'd come back
when we were less busy.
Send a tactical team over
right away.
Thanks.
If piersahl makes a move,
we'll be ready.
Tom.
It must be from piersahl.
Hey.
Do you like this color?
This place needs to be
a little more girly
if i'm going to be
living here.
Yeah, it looks great.
I think so, too.
I'm glad you're back.
If piersahl knows
we're on to him,
he'll change
his pattern of attack.
There's about
a dozen people
we can't find.
Let's hope we get to them
before piersahl does.
[Man]: Tom baldwin?
Yeah, who's asking?
My name is john.
John shaffner.
I was a volunteer
in the same program
darren piersahl was in.
The one
that drove him crazy.
Yeah, we know
who you are.
And we know about the program.
Good.
We were volunteers.
All of us.
I still remember
the sales pitch.
We'd be the elite,
a new type of soldier.
We had to give up
our lives,
forfeit our identities...
they said it was the only way.
The program had to operate
in complete secrecy.
When did you start
getting the injections?
Right away.
It started slow,
but about three weeks ago,
they started upping our dosages.
That's when guys started
to lose it.
Where did they
get their promicin?
I don't know,
but they seemed to have
plenty of it, though.
Darren was the first one
who could do stuff.
An ability.
He killed one of the instructors
by mistake.
It freaked him out.
You two escaped together?
Once we got out,
we pretty much went
our separate ways.
I had no idea
he was going do this.
So he's awol?
These murders aren't sanctioned
by anyone?
No, darren's
freelancing.
That's why they want him back
so bad.
He's compromising the program.
Our c.o. S, they told us
about the starzl mutation,
they told us
it could be a threat,
but they never told us
to kill anybody.
Then what is it?
Why does darren
want them dead so badly?
It's got something to do with...
babies.
So far,
any time a 4400
has a kid
with a member
of the regular population,
their babies are normal.
They don't make promicin.
They don't have abilities.
We know.
We've been tracking the births.
The starzl mutation
changes all that.
If a 4400 has a kid with someone
who has the mutation...
the baby would be
promicin-positive.
They'd have abilities.
How would the military
even know that?
Have they tried it?
I don't know,
but they seem pretty
goddamn sure it's true.
I know
this is going to sound crazy,
but darren
is a victim here, too.
They gave us so many stimulants.
They amped us up to kill,
and he snapped.
I don't know if he thinks
he's on a mission or something,
but i know
he needs to be stopped.
I'll do whatever i can
to help you find him.
<i>[Ryland]: so, what
do you think you know?</i>
Everything,
including the starzl mutation,
and i have to
give you credit...
if what you say is right,
it would explain
why the 4400
were sent back in 2004,
why they were all brought
to seattle...
this is the only place
the 4400 can reproduce
and have kids with abilities.
Any of this sound familiar?
I think i read the same theory
in a supermarket tabloid once.
We know about your enhanced
soldier program, dennis.
We have one of your people.
John shaffner
been showing up
for many roll calls
lately?
Well, as soon as
we have piersahl,
we're going public
with this,
and there's nothing
you can do to stop that.
All you can do
is make yourself
and this company
look slightly better
by cooperating with our efforts
to bring him in.
We want piersahl's
personnel file.
Everything you have.
If it's not in my hands
in 90 seconds,
john shaffner will be standing
in front of a bank of cameras
before lunch.
This could be something.
Maybe.
It reads like some kind
of personal statement.
An essay by piersahl.
Yeah, we had to do those
to get in the program.
They wanted us to write
about some goal
we achieved,
something
we were proud of.
This is all about
a volunteer program
that he did.
There was a patch of forest
that got cleared by a fire.
Piersahl volunteered to renew it
so that he could become a...
darren piersahl
was an eagle scout?
Yeah, he used to talk
about those woods
all the time.
When we were
in the middle of the program,
whenever things got really bad,
he used to tell me
that's where he'd go
in his head.
He'd imagine himself there.
It calmed him down.
This patch of forest,
any chance you know where it is?
[Camera clicking]
Maybe you could put
your arm around her, mr. Tyler.
That's great.
The magazine wants to get
a shot of the bride and groom.
Has anyone seen the groom?
Who gave you the key?
Your own bodyguard.
[Keys clatter]
You started a war,
richard.
You turned the 4400
into an army,
and you launched an attack
for no reason!
We didn't have a choice.
It had to be
a preemptive strike.
No choice?
Look at what
you're doing!
Look at it!
It has to stop.
Isabelle changed you.
You don't even know
who you are anymore.
She didn't change me.
She showed me who i am.
I know myself
better than ever,
and i know exactly
what has to happen here.
Don't do this.
[Gasps]
[Rasping]: Shawn...
[knock on door]
Shawn.
Sorry to barge in on you.
It's just...
they need you
down in the garden.
Pictures.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm just...
a little overwhelmed.
Darren?
Darren?
Darren, you out here?
What are you
doing here?
Darren, relax, man.
It's me, shaffner.
John.
We're friends,
remember?
Shaff.
You came.
That's good.
That's good.
I need your help.
I'm never going to make it
all the way through this list
on my own.
Darren, you don't have to
finish the list.
It's someone else's agenda.
You've got it all mixed up
in your head.
Come on with me.
There's some people
i want you to talk to.
They can help us.
"They"? Who are "they"?
It's got to stop, man.
Please.
Come with me.
No.
No.
Wait!
We've got people
covering the access road.
We'll pin him down.
Fan out!
[Bellows]
Oh, jesus.
Tom!
I can't see anything!
Tom...
tom!
Tom?
[Sputtering]
We lost shaffner.
Piersahl's dead.
He was on his way out
before we even
started fighting.
Piersahl had a stab wound
in his stomach.
I guess shaffner
didn't go down without a fight.
Yeah, well,
they're both gone,
and there's no one left
to talk about the program.
We still have evidence.
We can go after haspelcorp.
Expose everything.
Yeah, but it
would've been nice
to have a face
to put out there.
I mean, now all we have
are accusations
and a paper trail.
And five dead bodies.
Hey, you guys got to see this.
<i>We are proud to announce
the existence</i>
<i>of this
enhanced soldier program</i>
<i>to all the world,</i>
<i>but it should not
in any way be seen</i>
<i>as an offensive
maneuver.</i>
<i>We have evidence
suggesting</i>
<i>that other countries
have similar programs.</i>
<i>This is merely a response.</i>
<i>The young men</i>
<i>i'm about to
introduce to you</i>
<i>have been working
in secret,</i>
<i>and we've made
numerous advances.</i>
<i>In time,</i>
<i>they'll become
the first non-4400s</i>
<i>to develop
extra-human abilities,</i>
<i>and they'll use them</i>
<i>in the defense
of the united states.</i>
<i>Now i'd like to introduce
eight heroic young men,</i>
<i>all of whom have given
so much of themselves</i>
<i>to make this breakthrough
possible.</i>
Ryland's preempting us.
Trotting them
out there on stage
like they're
the first astronauts.
<i>Major jeremy elwood...</i>
<i>first lieutenant
raymond garcia,</i>
<i>first lieutenant jeff rice,</i>
<i>first lieutenant brian dawson,</i>
<i>second lieutenant
james knowlon,</i>
<i>second lieutenant
dirk danoff...</i>
the press conference was
a clever move, dennis.
I have to give credit
where it's due.
But this company
has five bodies
on its hands,
and i'm going to
make sure
everyone knows it.
Knows what?
We're not denying
anything.
It's unfortunate
that one of my men went awol,
but he was
clearly deranged.
I've got a whole team of doctors
standing by
to testify to that effect.
You created an assassin.
It's a tragedy,
and it's news, i'll admit that,
but tomorrow morning,
the piersahl case
will be below the fold
on every newspaper,
and all the headlines will be
about our program.
That's the way i see it, anyway.
Who's feeding you
your information?
You knew about
the starzl mutation
before we did.
You have a source
of promicin
for your program.
Who is it?
You give me
too much credit, tom.
That stuff happens
way above my security clearance.
The soldiers you're creating...
are you really going to use them
to defend the country?
Or are you just going to
send them after the 4400?
Is there a difference?
Enjoy your
nephew's wedding.
You sure you're
ready for this?
You look ready.
Let's do this.
[Cheering and applause]
Hello there.
Thank you for coming.
Thanks, kids.
Thank you for coming,
so much.
Thank you
for being here.
Thank you so much
for being here.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming so far.
Thank you.
Appreciate you coming
all this way.
Thank you so much.
Shawn!
Shawn farrell?
Do you know who i am?
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to www.1000fr.com</font>
Durant les 60 dernières années
4400 personnes ont été enlevées.
Toutes sont revenues en même temps
Sans aucun souvenir d'où elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines sont revenues
avec de nouvelles capacités.
Tous essaient de renouer...
...avec une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le Salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment, dans les 4400...
On est d'accord, ok ?
C'est fini entre nous.
Tu m'as dit un jour
qu'il fallait faire un choix
entre le bien et le mal.
Et je crains que si je dois te perdre,
Je vais faire le mauvais choix.
Bienvenue à Haspel Corp.
Puis-je vous aider ?
Bonjour.
J'ai un rendez-vous avec Dennis Ryland.
Vous avez du nouveau ?
Oui, elle est incroyable.
En une semaine on a fait des découvertes
qui nous auraient pris des années en temps normal.
Isabelle,
Je ne t'aime pas.
Shawn, toi et moi
sommes les deux personnes
les plus puissantes sur cette planète.
On doit se marier.
Je savais qu'elle était différente.
Dangereuse.
Tu ne peux pas me tuer Shawn.
Richard, si vraiment je pensais
que rester avec Isabelle sauverait tous ces gens,
Je l'épouserais demain.
Mais que se passera-t-il si elle se lasse de moi
ou si je la mets en colère ?
On m'a renvoyé pour faire des choses.
Des choses cruelles.
Je ne sais pas comment tu sais ça,
mais ce n'est pas obligé de se passer ainsi.
On doit être ensemble,
car je pense que tu es la seule
personne qui puisse m'arrêter.
Tu cherches un rendez-vous ?
Pas toi.
Lui.
Tim.
Tu as un client.
Donc, c'est 40$ si tu veux commencer.
Je veux juste te regarder une seconde.
Sais-tu à quel point tu es spécial ?
Tu ne sais pas, n'est-ce pas ?
Ecoute, on peut parler si tu veux
mais ça fera toujours 40$.
Timothy Winters McCarren.
Tu vas changer le monde.
Comment connaissez-vous mon nom ?
C'est vrai.
Tu vas tout changer,
A moins que je ne t'arrête.
Ca suffit, je sors d'ici.
Allez mec, laisse-moi sortir.
Je ne plaisante pas.
Je l'ai fait moi-même.
C'est ma façon de vous remercier
pour l'invitation à votre mariage.
Merci.
Ce n'était pas nécessaire.
Isabelle et moi avons invité tous les 4400.
Je ne l'aurais pas manqué.
Je suis un peu excité.
Vous devez l'être aussi.
La cérémonie est si proche.
4 jours.
Je dois vous prévénir.
Ce cigare,
quand vous allez le fumer,
vous pourriez être surpris par ses effets.
Oh, je ne vais pas être arrêté
pour possession de drogue, hein ?
Bien sûr que non.
A peu près un an après mon retour,
j'ai compris que j'avais un don.
Quand j'entre en contact avec des personnes,
elles ont parfois des visions, de leur futur.
Je ne vois rien, comprenez bien.
Seulement ceux que je touche.
Mais on m'a dit que c'était efficace.
Un don intéressant.
Merci.
J'ai roulé ce cigare moi-même.
Il a été en contact avec mes mains.
Et donc,
il contient mon don.
Attendez, vous êtes en train de
dire que si je fume ce cigare,
je vais voir le futur ?
Votre futur, oui.
Un futur qui peut se produire.
Comme je vous le disais,
utilisez-le avec précaution.
Vous risquez de ne pas aimer
ce que vous allez voir.
Mais je pense que c'est le cadeau parfait
pour un homme qui va se marier.
C'est vrai, c'est bien mieux qu'un grille-pain.
Merci.
Mes félicitations.
La pièce montée est fabuleuse.
Tu devrais y jeter un coup d'oeil.
Euh oui,
une fois que j'en aurai fini
avec les réunions, ok ?
Ah, tu commences à fumer ?
Voici Edwin Garret et sa femme Denise,
ils sont venus d'Edinburgh pour vous voir.
Merci infiniment d'être venu.
Le gars s'appelait Tim McCarren,
il se prostituait.
Il travaillait non loin d'ici.
J'ai trouvé son corps juste
après le levé du soleil.
J'ai déjà questionné ses collègues,
ils disent qu'il est monté
dans une camionnette avec un homme
dans la vingtaine, vers environ
1h30 du mat, la nuit dernière.
Un de ses collègues a vu l'homme de très près,
donc vous pourrez probablement le retrouver
avec un portrait robot.
Certainement, oui.
Vous savez que ceci est
un homicide, pas vrai ?
Nous sommes de l'NTAC.
Pourquoi nous avoir appelé ?
Voilà pourquoi.

Mon explication la plus plausible ?
Le corps s'est complètement oxydé.
C'est une réaction chimique.
Des cellules qui ont changé
au niveau moléculaire.
L'oxydation se produit
quand le métal rouille, non ?
Exactement.
Enfin, presque.
La rouille est un processus lent.
Ce qui s'est passé avec
Tim McCarren était spontané.
Une minute il était vivant, la suivante...
Avez-vous déjà vu quelque chose comme ça ?
Non.
Il n'y a aucune maladie connue qui
affecte le corps humain de cette façon.
Peut-être qu'une faculté
d'un 4400 a pu faire ça ?
C'est à vous de le découvrir.
Tout ce que je peux vous dire,
c'est que ce qui est arrivé
à ce gars n'est pas naturel.
Merci.
Même pas quelqu'un qui y ressemble ?
Ok, merci Bryan.
C'était le laboratoire.
Ils ont vérifié les facultés du conducteur
avec celles des 4400 répertoriées.
Pas de correspondance.
Des nouvelles du légiste ?
Non.
Enfin, ils ont pu récupérer des empreintes
trouvées sur la veste du jeune homme.
Mais rien qui permette d'établir son identité.
Et à propos du message ?
Laisser des messages sur
un corps avec des indications,
c'est la marque typique d'un tueur en série.
Oui, mais ça dit "27" ?
C'est impossible qu'il y ait
26 autres corps comme Tim McCarren.
Rien qu'un seul serait terrible.
Allons parler à ses parents,
ses amis, sa famille.
Tout ce qui pourrait
avoir un lien avec un 4400.
Diana, il y a quelque chose d'autre
dont j'aimerais te parler.
Tu es libre dimanche ?
Tu veux que j'aille
au mariage de Shawn avec toi ?
C'est n'est pas un rencart.
Ok ?
J'ai pensé que ça pourrait t'intéresser.
Presque mille 4400 seront présents.
Donc c'est juste professionnel ?
Oui.
Si tu le vois comme ça.
Ecoute, pour être honnête,
je n'aimerais pas être le seul
assis à la table de l'NTAC.
Tu aurais du mal à trouver
quelqu'un avec qui danser.
Ecoute,
tu sais, Maia m'a déjà supplié,
je lui ai dit non.
Tous ces 4400 au même endroit,
On ne sait pas ce qui peut se passer.
Diana, c'est Shawn et Isabelle.
Tout va bien se passer.
Mais, tu veux être du bon
ou du mauvais côté ?
Je peux croire que tu sois impatient
d'avoir cette fille dans ta famille.
Ce n'est pas le cas.
Tout est allé un peu trop vite à mon goût.
Mais Shawn ne veut pas m'en parler.
J'ai dû lui laisser au moins 20 messages.
Je pensais...
aller le voir après le boulot aujourd'hui.
Mais assure-toi que la fiancée démoniaque
ne puisse pas vous entendre.
Je dois le faire.
"Dois" ?
Tu vas te marier Shawn,
tu devrais dire "veux".
Que se passe-t-il ? Elle est enceinte ?
Non, pas du tout.
Elle t'y oblige ?
Ecoute Shawn, si tu te sens piégé,
si tu cherches à sortir de là,
dis-le moi et je t'aiderai.
"Aider" ? Oncle Tommy.
Je ne...
Je ne fais rien de spécial,
je vais me marier,
les gens font ça tout le temps.
Bon sang Shawn, tu vas épouser Isabelle.
C'est une fille très dangereuse.
J'ai eu l'occasion de m'en apercevoir.
Ok, je la connais aussi.
N'espère pas me surprendre.
J'apprécie ta visite,
je sais que tu pensais bien faire,
mais ce mariage, c'est une bonne chose.
Une bonne chose pour qui ?
Pour tout le monde.
Rien ne marche jamais ici !
Ca arrive tout le temps
quand je travaille tard.
Vous savez quoi ? Je ne sais pas
où sont les escaliers ici.
Par là-bas.
Venez, je vais vous montrer.
Donc, vous travaillez souvent après 20h ?
La plupart des soirs, oui,
j'essaie d'avoir une promotion.
Motivée ? J'aime ça.
C'est comme ça que vous pourrez
faire de grandes choses.
Son nom était Paula Nakata.
Elle était avocate dans une
société de cette immeuble.
Mon Dieu,
cette pauvre femme.
Cela fait 2 morts en moins de 24 heures.
Ca n'a aucun sens.
La plupart des tueurs en série ont un type.
Mais Tim McCarren et Paula Nakata
n'ont rien du tout en commun.
Un prostitué et une avocate.
Pourquoi quelqu'un voudrait
les prendre pour cible ?
Et pourquoi lui mettre ce chiffre 11 ?
Les nombres sur les corps
sont décroissants.
Il se pourrait qu'on ait une
empreinte partielle sur l'alliance.
Ca appartient probablement
à la victime mais on ne sait jamais.
Espérons que le coupable ait fait une erreur,
car je ne crois pas qu'il soit
sur le point d'avoir fini.
Nous étions si proches.
Nous allions tous les sauver.
Isabelle t'a changé.
Tu ne sais plus...
qui tu es désormais.
Elle ne m'a pas changé.
Elle m'a montré qui je suis.
Je me connais mieux que jamais.
Et je sais exactement ce
qui doit se passer ici.
Ne fais pas ça.
Shawn.
Marco ?
Tu es rentré chez toi hier soir ?
Non, euh.
J'ai travaillé sur votre affaire.
Ca m'a pris du temps.
Froid.
On a eu un message disant
que tu voulais nous parler ?
Euh oui ... Le ...
L'empreinte qu'ils ont relevé
sur l'alliance de Paula Nakata...
Ce n'était pas la sienne.
Elle correspond à celle trouvée
sur le corps de Tim McCarren ?
En effet.
L'empreinte
appartient à un homme
appelé Darren Piersahl.
Piersahl ?
Jamais entendu parlé.
Je ne suis pas surpris.
Vous voyez...
il n'est pas un 4400.
Donc il n'est pas l'assassin.
Marco, tu as vu les 2 corps,
un 4400 a tué ces gens.
Ca pourrait être le cas.
La correspondance des empreintes
ne vient pas de notre base de données.
Elle provient des données de l'armée.
Piersahl a été un rangers pendant 7 ans.
"A été" ? Pourquoi ?
Il fait quoi maintenant ?
Pas grand-chose.
D'après les données de l'armée,
Darren Piersahl est mort.
Il a été tué au cours d'une mission
en Irak en 2005.
Je me pose une question.
Comment un sergent de l'armée,
supposé mort depuis des années,
peut utiliser une faculté des 4400
pour tuer des gens de nos jours à Seattle.
Darren a toujours voulu être un Rangers.
C'était son rêve.
Depuis qu'il a été capable de lire.
Je l'ai encouragé, j'ai moi-même
servi pendant 20 ans.
Donc,
quand Darren s'est engagé,
c'était comme...
perpétuer la tradition familliale.
Pourquoi l'NTAC est-il intéressé
par la mort de mon fils ?
Cela fait partie d'une enquête en cours,
Mr Piersahl.
La moindre chose que vous pourrez
nous dire, nous aidera.
Quelque temps avant sa mort,
j'ai reçu une lettre de Darren.
Il était excité.
Il disait qu'il avait été accepté dans...
une formation pour des unités d'élite.
Il ne pouvait pas m'en dire plus.
Juste après ça,
il a été transféré sur le front,
à des milliers de kilomètres.
Et il a été tué en mission juste après ça ?
2 semaines après.
L'armée m'a dit qu'il...
était en mission de reconnaissance
sur un hélicoptère de type OH58.
Il a été touché par un missile.
Ils n'ont jamais trouvé les restes.
Nous sommes navrés Mr Piersahl.
Vous avez dit que...
l'armée vous a dit que c'était
une mission de reconnaissance.
Vous avez une raison d'en douter ?
J'ai trouvé le timing curieux.
J'ai reçu sa lettre et il est mort juste après.
J'ai fait quelques vérifications.
Il y avait en tout 6 soldats
qui sont morts dans le même crash que mon fils.
Et pourquoi est-ce bizarre ?
Parce qu'un OH58 ne possède que 4 places.
Il ne peut pas contenir 6 personnes.
Un programme de formation secret ?
Un mort dans des conditions suspectes ?
Il se passe quelque chose.
Même le père du gamin le sait.
C'est bizarre, je ne le nie pas.
Prenons simplement notre temps, ok ?
Il y a d'autres explications
n'impliquant pas de secret.
Quelqu'un aurait pu mettre les empreintes
de Darren sur la scène du crime.
Qui sait ? C'était peut-être un 4400
qui a pu imiter les empreintes
de quelqu'un d'autre.
Peut-être.
Si tu essaies de faire porter
le chapeau à quelqu'un,
pourquoi choisir un homme décédé ?
Baldwin ?
Où ça ?
On arrive de suite.
Ils viennent juste de trouver un autre mort.
Je vais vous confesser
un petit secret de famille.
Mon frère et moi avons eu quelques différents,
donc on ne s'est pas parlé pendant un moment.
Je suis allé à l'université,
il est devenu la personne la plus connue
dans le monde entier.
Mais tout va bien,
Parce que c'est un gars bien,
et je suis vraiment fier de lui.
Je pense que c'est le cas de tous.
Alors...
Félicitations, mec.
Je ne peux pas être plus heureux pour toi
de te voir franchir le pas.
Félicitations.
Tchin.
Y'a quelque chose que
tu voudrais dire, papa ?
Un toast.
Le père de la mariée voudrait dire
quelque chose.
Euh...
Shawn...
Isabelle...
Je dois l'avouer,
j'ai eu des moments de doute...
Mais ma fille s'est débrouillée
pour les surmonter.
Elle était vraiment convaincue
que ce mariage aurait lieu
et donc nous y voilà.
Shawn, elle n'aurait pu trouver
un meilleur partenaire.
Je suis fier de pouvoir t'appeller mon fils.
Tchin.
Tchin.
Tchin.
Alors...
Où allez-vous pour votre lune de miel ?
Hé bien, on n'a pas trop
eu le temps d'y réfléchir.
Si vous voulez bien m'excuser un moment...
Reste là.
Tu continues de charmer tes beaux-parents.
Je vais voir ce qu'il y a.
Isabelle...
Oh.
Tu m'as vu mourir ?
T'en es sûr ?
J'étais en train de te tuer,
et Richard,
je le jure devant Dieu,
on dirait que j'étais content.
La seule raison qui me pousse
à me marier avec Isabelle
c'est pour l'avoir à mes côtés,
être normal...
Ce n'est pas ce qu'il va se passer.
Je ne vais pas la rendre plus humaine.
C'est elle qui va me rendre monstrueux.
Ecoute, je dois essayer quelque chose.
Je dois y aller.
Je dois voir si ça change quelque chose.
Tu vas partir le jour de ton mariage ?
Peut-être. Je ne sais pas.
Je... Je vais m'en aller d'ici,
et voir ensuite ce qui se passe.
Si tu pars maintenant
ça ne va pas faire plaisir à Isabelle.
Peut-être que tu vas avoir du mal à revenir.
Je sais ça,
mais je dois le faire.
Juste...
Dis-leur que je suis malade
ou un truc comme ça. Je suis désolé.
Dis-leur juste quelque chose, ok ?
Elle s'appelait Holly Martins.
Elle était femme au foyer
à madison park.
L'homme de service a trouvé son corps.
Il y avait un message ?
"92" ?
Combien de personnes, ce gars
a-t-il pour cible ?
Les gars, j'ai découvert ce que
tous les corps avaient en commun.
Toutes les victimes avaient
la même mutation ?
On fait une recherche génétique
sur les trois corps.
Chacun d'entre eux a une légère altération
sur le 11ème chromosome.
On appelle ça la mutation de Starlz.
C'est peut-être une coïncidence.
Pas vraiment.
La mutation de Starlz est extrêmement rare.
Les deux seuls cas connus
se situent à Seattle.
Vous voyez, il y a deux sortes de mutations.
Certaines apparaissent naturellement.
Vous savez, quelque chose va mal
donc le corps se soigne tout seul.
D'autres sont provoquées.
Les gènes changent par l'introduction
de facteurs externes.
La mutation de Starlz est provoquée.
Exactement.
Ca a commencé en 1969.
L'hôpital protestant de Seattle
a utilisé des machines de radiation déféctueuses
pour traiter le cancer de leurs patients.
Les micros-contacts
qui contrôlaient le cancer
n'ont pas fonctionné.
Donc tous les dosages étaient mauvais.
Combien de temps ça a duré ?
Un peu moins de cinq ans.
Une fois que l'hôpital s'en est
rendu compte,
qu'est-ce qu'ils ont fait ?
Ils ont testé tout ceux
qui ont été exposé.
Dans certains cas,
les radiations ont entraîné
de légères mutations.
La mutation de Starzl .
Ouais, ils lui ont donné le nom
de la société qui a construit
la machine défectueuse.
La mutation est héréditaire.
Les gens qui l'ont, la transmettent
à leurs enfants,
ce qui inclut... nos trois victimes.
Mais ils ont tous vécu des vies normales.
Ils étaient en bonne santé.
Comme la plupart des mutations,
vous pouvez l'avoir sans le savoir.
Après que tout soit rendu public,
les avocats se sont amusés.
Il y a eu un procès collectif.
L'hôpital de Seattle a payé
d'énormes dommages et interêts
à chaque personne infectée par la machine.
Ils ont frôlé la banqueroute.
Donc Darren Piersahl,
qui est supposé être mort,
à pour cible ceux qui véhiculent
la mutation de Starzl.
Seulement ceux qui habitent Seattle,
et qui ne savent pas qu'ils sont
porteurs de cette mutation.
Ok, mais pourquoi ?
Excellente question.
Quand vous aurez trouvé, appelez-moi.
S'il y avait eu un procès,
il y aurait eu des traces écrites.
Je vous parie que l'hôpital
a gardé une liste
de tout ceux qu'ils ont payé.
Ca va ?
Shawn...
Tu dois arrêter de me soigner.
Non, tu vas t'en sortir oncle Tom.
Non, Shawn.
Tout est de ma faute.
Je n'aurais jamais dû t'en parler
durant ton mariage avec Isabelle.
Non, c'était ma décision, pas la tienne.
Je ne peux pas m'empêcher de penser
que ça n'aurait jamais dû finir ainsi.
Tout ceux que nous aimons sont morts.
Je suis désolé.
La catastrophe est arrivée.
Hé...
non, non, non.
Attends, tiens bon,
tiens bon...
Reviens...
Non ! Laisse-moi.
Laisse-moi !
Sauve autant de gens que tu peux, Shawn.
Vous avez de la chance.
Jusqu'à alors six semaines,
je n'avais pas sorti ce fichier
depuis des années.
Si vous me l'aviez demandé,
ça m'aurait pris plusieurs heures
pour le trouver.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé
il y a six semaines ?
Un homme en uniforme est venu.
Il avait un document avec lui
disant que l'armée avait besoin du fichier
pour euh, des recherches
contre la guerre avec les terroristes.
Ouais, le voilà.
C'est la liste principale de tout ceux que
nous avons dédommagé suite à l'affaire Starzl.
Cet homme, pouvez-vous me donner
son nom ?
Ouais...
Miles Enright.
Pourquoi ? Vous le connaissez ?
Pas encore.
Il y a 123 personnes là-dessus.
123 personnes qui ont subi
la mutation de Starzl.
Et les numéros que nous avons trouvé
sur les corps
correspondent aux nombres de la liste.
Numéro 27, Timothy McCarren.
Numéro 11, Paula Nakata.
Et Holly Martins, 92.
Donc si Darren Piersahl
est le tueur,
Il travaille avec la même liste que nous.
Mais l'ordre semble aléatoire.
Je veux dire, est-ce qu'il les tue
dès qu'une occasion se présente,
ou a-t-il une méthode ?
Je vais essayer de trouver un lien.
Hé, euh...
Comment va Maia ?
Elle va bien.
Elle demande beaucoup après toi.
Ouais ?
Je viens de regarder le dossier
de Miles Enright.
Il est le vice-président de la recherche
et du développement de Haspelcorp.
Dennis.
Vous avez ignorés nos coups de fil.
Je suis occupé, Tom.
Pourquoi n'allez-vous pas voir
mon assistante ?
Peut-être pourrions-nous parler
la semaine prochaine.
C'est important, Ryland.
C'est à propos de Darren Piersahl,
et du programme de votre société
pour créer une division militaire
de l'Armée Américaine
avec les capacités des 4400.
Je n'en sais rien, Tom.
Je ne travaille ici que depuis 3 mois.
Je ne sais même pas
où est l'armoire des fournitures.
Et maintenant vous êtes persuadés
que je couvre un programme
dans lequel je suis censé injecter la promicine
à tous les soldats Américains ?
Il y a 6 semaines de cela,
le vice-président
de la recherche et du développement
a obtenu une liste de tout ceux
qui ont la mutation de Starzl.
Miles Enright.
Peut-être le connaissez-vous ?
Désolé. C'est un grand building.
Je ne connais pas encore tout le monde.
3 personnes sont mortes.
Maintenant, vous devez nous dire
tout ce que vous savez
à propos de Darren Piersahl.
Ainsi nous pourrions l'enfermer
avant qu'il ne tue quelqu'un d'autre.
Je n'ai jamais entendu parlé de lui,
et je n'ai certainement
jamais entendu parlé de ça...
Comment appelez-vous ça ?
"La mutation de Starzl" ?
C'est votre dernière chance de coopérer
avant que nous trouvions Piersahl.
Si vous nous aidez maintenant,
nous aiderons votre société,
plus tard, Dennis.
Eh bien, comment pourrais-je vous aider
si je ne sais pas
de quoi vous me parlez ?
Maintenant,
si ce programme existait...
et s'il vous plaît, comprenez bien,
je ne suis pas en train de dire que c'est le cas,
vous semblez penser
que les gens seraient bouleversés
d'apprendre l'existence de soldats comme ça.
Moi, je pense qu'ils seraient reconnaissants.
Je pense que chaque bon citoyen
devrait être reconnaissant
de ce que son gouvernement
est en train d'accomplir,
car vous pouvez être sûrs et certains
que nos ennemis le sont.
Si tout le monde devrait être si heureux,
pourquoi ne pas juste tout nous raconter ?
Comme d'habitude,
vous n'avez pas idée
de ce qui est en jeu.
Quiconque a le contrôle de la promicine
a un avantage stratégique
sur tout le reste du Monde.
C'est un autre projet Manhattan, Tom.
Et ils ne se sont pas arrêtés
sous prétexte qu'un ensemble de techniciens
a été empoisonné par les radiations.
Ils ont continué,
et ils avaient raison.
Ca a rendu le monde meilleur.
Vous n'êtes pas en train d'admettre
que ce programme existe, pas vrai ?
Quel programme ?
Donc si je ne tiens pas compte de ça,
et si je me marie avec Isabelle,
toi et moi deviendrons ennemis.
Je vais te tuer.
Si je ne fais pas cela...
Richard, les choses vont s'empirées.
Des gens sont morts.
Beaucoup de gens.
Dans la seconde vision,
ton oncle dit
que la catastrophe était ici,
n'est-ce pas ?
L'endroit ressemblait à un champs de bataille.
Qu'est-ce que je suis supposé faire ?
Ecoute, tu peux seulement agir
avec les informations que tu as.
Dans un futur, je vais mourir.
Dans un autre,
ça pourrait être des milliers
de personnes,
peut-être des millions, au pire.
Le choix est déjà fait.
Nous sommes en train de parler
de ta vie.
Le gars a dit que chaque vision
était un futur possible.
Si tu te maries avec Isabelle...
au moins nous allons être présents
en bonne santé.
Maintenant nous savons ce
qui pourrait se passer.
Nous pouvons changer les choses.
Rien n'est inévitable, pas vrai ?
Espérons que non...
Car crois-moi...
je ne veux pas mourir.
Rencontrez le sergent John Shaffner.
Ok, alors pourquoi devons-nous
le rencontrer ?
Il faisait partie des 6 morts
dans le crash de l'hélicoptère
qui a "tué" Darren Piersahl.
Un hélicoptère
qui ne peut contenir que 4 personnes.
Tout à fait.
Il s'avère que la famille
de John Shaffner
n'a jamais reçu ses restes non plus.
Tu sais, il y a vraiment eu
un crash d'hélicoptère
ce jour-là en Irak,
mais quatre familles ont recupéré les
corps de leurs enfants.
Mais ce n'est pas le cas des deux autres.
Voilà ce que je crois...
Tu penses que Piersahl et Shaffner
ont été recruté en vue d'introduire
le progamme d'entraînement d'Haspelcorp
en même temps.
Ainsi ils se sont servis du crash
pour simuler deux morts.
Pour que Piersahl et Shaffner
puissent disparaître
dans le programme, impunément.
Donc nous avons un second membre
du progamme d'Haspelcorp,
ce qui est génial,
mais cela ne nous permet pas
de nous approcher de Darren Piersahl.
Bien vu.
Non, en effet.
Non, à moins que...
vous regardez les plaques d'identification
de Shaffner.
C'est le numéro de série de
l'armée de Shaffner..
Ca vous paraît familier ?
On devrait ?
27.
C'est ce que le message que nous avons
trouvé sur Tim McCarren disait.
C'est aussi là où nous avons trouvé son nom,
dans la liste des gens ayant
la mutation de Starzl.
11.
C'était le numéro de Paula Nakata.
Et Holly Martins était 92ème dans la liste.
Donc il y a un lien.
Il choisit l'ordre
en fonction du numéro de série
de son copain.
OK, mais pourquoi ?
Peut-être est-ce un message,
peut-être le font-ils ensemble,
mais si c'est logique,
la prochaine victime
sera le numéro 38 de la liste de Starzl.
Alex Messina.
J'ai fait une recherche sur lui.
Il s'occupe d'un magasin de
vélos dans Madrona.
Ouais, je le reconnais.
Il est venu un peu plus tôt aujourd'hui.
Vous a-t-il dit quoi que ce soit ?
C'était assez étrange, en fait.
Il m'a demandé si mon nom
était Alex Messina.
Il l'a demandé comme ça.
Vous savez, le nom entier ?
Il a voulu savoir si je pouvais sortir
et jeter un coup d'oeil à son vélo.
Il avait besoin de remettre
en place une partie...
Je lui ai juste dit de le rentrer.
Il a dit qu'il reviendrait
quand nous serions moins occupés.
Envoyez une équipe sur le
terrain tout de suite.
Merci.
Si Piersahl fait un mouvement,
nous serons prêts.
Tom.
Ca doit venir de Piersahl.
Hé.
Tu aimes cette couleur ?
Cet endroit aura besoin
d'être un peu plus féminin
si je m'installe ici.
Ouais, ça a l'air cool.
C'est ce que je crois, aussi.
Je suis contente que tu sois revenu.
Si Piersahl apprend que nous sommes après lui,
il changera son modèle d'attaque.
Il y a environ une douzaine de personnes
que nous ne pouvons pas trouver.
Espérons leur mettre la main
dessus avant Piersahl.
Tom Baldwin ?
Oui, qui est-ce ?
Mon nom est John.
John Shaffner.
J'étais un volontaire dans le même programme
que Piersahl.
Celui qui l'a rendu fou.
Ouais, nous savons qui vous êtes.
Et nous savons à propos du programme.
Bien.
Alors vous êtes prêts à entendre
ce que j'ai à vous dire.
Nous étions volontaires. Tous.
Je me rappelle toujours le
discours pour nous convaincre.
Nous serions l'élite,
un nouveau genre de soldat.
Nous avons dû renoncer à nos vies,
Perdre nos identités.
Ils disaient que c'était la seule façon.
Le programme devait se dérouler
dans le secret complet.
Quand avez-vous commencé
à prendre les injections ?
Immédiatement.
Cela a commencé lentement,
mais il y a environ trois semaines,
ils ont commencé à augmenter nos doses.
C'est quand les types
commençaient à être à sec.
Où ont-ils obtenu la promicine ?
Je ne sais pas, mais ils semblaient
en avoir beaucoup cependant.
Darren a été le premier
à pouvoir faire des choses.
Une capacité ?
Il a tué un des instructeurs par erreur.
Ca l'a fait flipper.
Vous vous êtes évadés ensemble ?
Une fois que nous sommes sortis,
nous nous sommes séparés.
J'avais aucune idée sur ce qu'il allait faire.
Donc il a déserté ?
Ces meurtres n'ont été
commandité par personne ?
Non, Darren agit seul.
C'est pourquoi ils veulent vraiment
qu'il revienne.
Il compromet le programme.
Nos officiers, ils nous ont parlé
de la mutation de Starzl,
ils nous ont dit que cela
pourrait être une menace,
mais ils ne nous ont jamais parlé
de tuer quelqu'un.
Alors qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Pourquoi Darren veut les voir morts ?
Il y a quelque chose avec...
les bébés.
Jusqu'ici,
chaque fois qu'un 4400 a un enfant
avec un membre de la population normale,
l'enfant est normal.
Ils ne produisent pas de promicine.
Ils n'ont pas de capacités.
Nous savons.
Nous avons suivi les naissances à la trace.
La mutation de Starzl change tout cela.
Si un 4400 a un enfant avec quelqu'un
qui a eu la mutation...
le bébé produira de la promicine.
Il aura des capacités.
Comment les militaires le sauraient-ils ?
Ils ont essayé ?
Je ne sais pas,
mais ils semblent assez sûrs de ça.
Je sais que cela va sembler fou,
mais Darren est aussi une victime
dans tout ça.
Ils nous ont donné tant de stimulants.
Ils ont augmenté les dosages jusqu'à nous tuer,
et il a perdu les pédales.
Je ne sais pas s'il pense être sur une mission
ou quelque chose,
mais je sais qu'il doit être arrêté.
Je ferai ce que je peux pour vous aider
à le trouver.
Alors, que pensez-vous savoir ?
Tout, y compris la mutation de Starzl,
et je dois vous donner du crédit...
Si ce que vous dîtes est exact,
ça expliquerait
pourquoi les 4400 ont été renvoyés en 2004,
pourquoi ils ont tous été ammenés
à Seattle...
C'est le seul endroit
où les 4400 peuvent se reproduire
et avoir des enfants avec des capacités.
Rien de tout cela ne vous paraît familier ?
Je pense avoir déjà lu la même théorie
sur le tabloïd d'un supermarché.
Nous sommes au courant de votre programme
d'amélioration des soldats, Dennis.
Nous avons un de vos hommes.
John Shaffner est grillé
pour ces derniers nombreux appels ?
Bon, tant que nous avons Piersahl,
nous allons raconter tout cela,
et il n'y a rien à faire
pour empêcher cela.
Tout ce que vous pouvez faire
c'est améliorer votre image,
ainsi que celle de votre entreprise
en coopérant à nos efforts
pour le ramener.
Nous voulons le dossier personnel
de Piersahl.
Tout ce que vous avez.
Si ce n'est pas entre mes mains
dans 60 secondes,
John Shaffner sera en face
des caméras d'une banque
avant le déjeuner.
Ca pourrait être quelque chose.
Peut-être.
Ca se lit comme un sorte
de déclaration personnelle.
Un essai de Piersahl.
Ouais, nous devions le faire
pour intégrer le programme.
Ils voulaient que nous décrivions
un but que nous avions atteint,
quelque chose dont nous étions fiers.
Ca parle
d'un programme bénévole
auquel il a participé.
Il y avait un secteur de la forêt
qui avait été ravagé par le feu.
Piersahl était volontaire pour replanter,
de sorte qu'il ait pu devenir..
Darren Piersahl
était une éclaireur/scout ?
Ouais, il avait l'habitude de
parler de ces bois,
tout le temps.
A la moitié du programme,
Chaque fois que les choses tournaient mal,
il me disait souvent
que ce serait là qu'il devrait aller
dans sa tête.
Il s'y imaginait lui-même.
Ca le calmait.
Cette partie de la forêt, y'a-t-il une chance
que vous sachiez où ça ce trouve ?
Peut-être, pourriez-vous mettre votre bras
autours d'elle, Mr. Tyler.
C'est super.
Le magazine veut faire une photo
de la jeune mariée et du marié.
Quelqu'un a-t-il vu le marié ?
Qui a la clé ?
Votre propre garde du corps.
Vous commencez une guerre, Richard.
Vous transformez les 4400 en une armée,
et vous lancez une attaque sans raison !
Nous n'avions pas le choix.
Ca aurait dû être
une attaque préventive.
Pas le choix ?
Regarde ce que tu es en train de faire !
Regarde !
Ca doit s'arrêter.
Isabelle t'a changé.
Tu ne sais même plus qui tu es.
Elle ne m'a pas changé.
Elle m'a montré qui je suis.
Je me connais mieux que jamais,
et je sais exactement
ce qui doit se passer ici.
Ne fais pas ça.
Shawn...
Shawn.
Excuse-moi de te déranger,
c'est juste...
Ils ont besoin de toi dans le jardin.
Des photos.
Ca va ?
Ca va.
Je suis ...
un peu assommé.
Darren ?
Darren ?
Darren, tu es là ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Darren, relax, mec.
C'est moi, Shaffner.
John.
On était amis, tu te souviens ?
Shaff.
Tu es venu.
C'est bien.
C'est bien,
j'ai besoin de toi.
Je ne pourrai jamais m'occuper
de cette liste
tout seul.
Darren, tu n'es pas obligé de terminer.
C'est la mission de quelqu'un d'autre.
C'est confus dans ton esprit.
Viens avec moi.
Il y a des gens avec qui
je veux que tu parles.
Ils peuvent nous aider.
- "Ils" ! Qui sont-Ils ?
Ca doit s'arrêter !
S'il te plaît.
Viens avec moi.
Non.
Non.
Attends !
Nous avons des agents
qui couvrent la voie d'accès,
on va l'avoir.
Soyez prêts !
Oh mon dieu.
Tom !
Je ne vois plus rien !
Tom...
Tom !
Tom ?
Nous avons perdu Shaffner.
Piersahl est mort.
Il allait partir
avant qu'on commence à se battre.
Piersahl avait une blessure de poignard
à l'estomac;
je pense que Shaffner ne se rendra pas
sans se battre.
Ouais, eh bien, on a aucun des deux,
et il ne reste personne
pour nous parler du programme.
Nous avons toujours une preuve.
Nous pouvons aller à Haspelcorp.
Tout dire.
Ouais, mais ça aurait été bien
d'avoir quelque chose de concret.
Je veux dire, tout ce que nous avons
ce sont des accusations
et un bout de papier.
Et cinq corps.
Hé, vous devriez voir ça.
<i>Nous sommes fiers d'annoncer l'existence</i>
<i>de ce programme
de soldats améliorés</i>
<i>au monde entier,</i>
<i>mais vous ne devez
en aucune façon le voir</i>
<i>comme une manoeuvre offensive.</i>
<i>Nous avons la preuve</i>
<i>que d'autres pays ont un
programme similaire.</i>
<i>C'est simplement une réponse à cela.</i>
<i>Les jeunes hommes</i>
<i>que je suis sur le point
de vous présenter</i>
<i>ont travaillé en secret,</i>
<i>et nous avons fait de nombreux progrès.</i>
<i>Quand il le faudra,</i>
<i>ils deviendront les premiers
non-4400</i>
<i>à developper des capacités
non-humaines,</i>
<i>et ils les utiliseront</i>
<i>lour la défense des Etats-Unis
d'Amérique.</i>
<i>Maintenant j'aimerais vous présenter
les héroïques jeunes hommes,</i>
<i>qui ont donné tant
de leur personne</i>
<i>pour rendre cette découverte possible.</i>
Ryland nous a devancé.
Il les met sur le devant de la scène
comme s'ils étaient
les premiers astronautes.
<i>Major Jeremy Elwood...</i>
<i>premier lieutenant Raymond Garcia,</i>
<i>premier lieutenant Jeff Rice,</i>
<i>premier lieutenant Brian Dawson,</i>
<i>second lieutenant James Knowlon,</i>
<i>second lieutenant Dirk Danoff...</i>
la conférence de presse a été
une manoeuvre intéressante, Dennis.
Je ne peux que te l'accorder.
Mais cette compagnie
a cinq cadavres sur les bras
et je vais faire en sorte
que tout le monde le sache.
Sache quoi ?
Nous ne nions rien.
Il est malheureux qu'un de mes hommes
ait pété les plombs,
mais il était complètement cinglé.
J'ai toute une équipe de docteurs
prête à témoigner de cela.
Tu as créé un assassin.
C'est une tragédie,
ça pourrait faire un bel article,
je l'admets,
mais demain matin,
le cas Piersahl sera oublié
et dans tous les journaux,
les gros titres ne parleront
que de notre programme.
C'est comme ça que je le vois.
Qui t'a donné tes informations ?
Tu savais pour la mutation de Starzl
avant nous.
Tu as une source de promicine
pour ton programme.
Qui est-ce ?
Vous me donnez trop de crédit, Tom.
Ca s'est passé bien au-dessus
de mon niveau d'autorité.
Les soldats que tu crées...
vas-tu vraiment les utiliser
pour défendre le pays ?
Ou pour les envoyer poursuivre les 4400 ?
Y'a-t-il une différence ?
Apprécie le mariage de ton neveu.
Tu es sûr d'être prêt pour ça ?
Tu as l'air prêt.
Allons-y.
Bonjour.
Merci d'être venus.
Merci les enfants.
Merci d'être venus,
je vous remercie de votre présence.
Je vous remercie de votre présence.
Merci.
Merci d'être venus de si loin.
Merci.
J'apprécie que vous
ayez fait tout ce chemin.
Merci beaucoup.
Shawn !
Shawn Farrell ?
Sais-tu qui je suis ?

We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
Okay, we're clear, right?
It's over between the two of us.
You once told me
that good and evil was a choice.
And I'm afraid if I lose you,
I'm going to make the Wrong one,
Welcome to Haspel Corp.
How may I help you?
Hi, I have an appointment
with Dennis Ryland.
Learning anything new?
Yeah, she's incredible.
In a week, we've made discoveries
we thought it would take years
to get to.
Isabelle, I don't love you.
Shawn, you and I are the two
most powerful people on the planet.
We have to get married.
I kneW she Was different,
Dangerous,
You can't kill me, Shawn.
Richard, if I believe
that staying with lsabelle
would save all those lives,
I would marry her tomorrow.
But what happens
if she gets tired of me
or I make her angry?
There are things I was
sent here to do. Brutal things.
I don't knoW hoW you knoW that,
but it doesn't have to happen,
We need to be together,
because I think you're the only one
who can stop me.
Looking for a date?
Not you.
Him.
Tim, you got a customer.
So it's 40 bucks
if you want to get started.
I just wanna look at you
for a second.
Do you have any idea
how special you are?
You don't, do you?
Look, we can talk if you want to,
but it's still 40 bucks.
Timothy Winters McCarren.
You're going to change the world.
How'd you know my name?
It's true.
You're gonna change everything.
Unless I stop you.
That's it, I'm out of here.
Come on, man, let me out.
I'm serious.
I rolled that myself.
It's my way of saying thank you
for inviting me to your wedding.
Thank you.
But you didn't have to.
Isabelle and I invited every 4400.
I wouldn't have missed it.
I'm quite excited.
You must be too.
The ceremony's so close.
Four days.
I have to offer you a word of caution.
This cigar, when you smoke it,
you might be surprised by its effects.
Oh, I'm not gonna get arrested
for having this, am l?
Of course not.
About a year after we returned,
I learned I have an ability.
When I come in contact
with a person,
they sometimes see a vision
of their future.
I see nothing, understand.
Only those I touch.
But I'm told it can be quite accurate.
Kind of a nice talent.
Thank you.
I grew this tobacco myself.
It's been in contact with my hands.
And so it contains my ability.
Wait, so, what you're saying is,
if I smoke this cigar,
I'm gonna see the future?
Your future.
A possible one, anyway.
As I said, use with caution.
You might not like what you see.
But it seems an appropriate gift
for a man on his wedding day.
Well, it is better than a toaster oven.
Thank you, Claudio.
My congratulations to you.
The centerpieces are amazing.
You should take a look.
Yeah, sure,
after we're done with these
meet-and-greets though, okay?
Oh, you're taking up smoking?
This is Edwin Garrett
and his wife Denise.
They came from
Edinburgh to be here.
Thank you so much for coming.
The guy's name was Tim McCarren.
He was a hustler.
Worked an area of the park
not far from here.
I found his body just after sunrise.
Now, I've already interviewed
his colleagues,
and they say he got into a pickup truck
with a man in his 20s
at about 1 :30 last night.
One of the other working boys
got a decent look at the driver.
You could probably sit him down
with a sketch artist.
We could, but you do realize
we're not homicide cops, right?
We're from NTAC.
So why'd you call us?
That's why.
My best guess?
This body was completely oxidized.
It's a chemical reaction.
Cells change at the molecular level.
Well, oxidizing, that's what happens
when metal rusts.
Exactly.
Well, almost exactly.
Rusting is a slow process.
There's nothing gradual about
what happened to Tim McCarren.
One minute he was alive, the next...
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?
No. There's no documented disease
that affects the human body this way.
- Meaning a 4400 ability did this.
- That's for you to figure out.
All I can tell you is
there's no earthly explanation
about what happened to this guy.
Thanks.
So nothing even close?
Okay, thanks, Brian.
That was the lab.
They ran the composite sketch
of the driver
against their database of 4400s.
- No matches.
- Anything from forensics?
No. Well, they pulled a couple
of partial prints off the safety pin
that held the note to the kid's jacket.
But nothing we can
make an lD from.
Okay, what about the note?
It's a deliberate message
to whoever found the body.
That's typical
of a serial-killer pathology.
Yeah, but it says 27.
There can't be 26 other corpses
like Tim McCarren's out there.
Even one would make it
onto our radar.
So we'll talk
to McCarren's friends, families.
Maybe he's got
a connection to a 4400.
Diana, there is one other thing
I wanna talk to you about.
You got plans on Sunday?
You want me to go
to Shawn's wedding with you?
It's not a date, okay?
I figured you might be interested.
Almost a thousand 4400s
are coming.
Oh, so it's a professional courtesy.
Yeah, that's one way to put it.
Look, to be honest,
I'd rather not be the only one
sitting at the NTAC table.
You'd have a hard time
finding a dance partner.
Look, you know, Maia begged me
to go, and I told her no.
All those 4400s in one place,
we have no idea what could happen.
Diana, it's Shawn and lsabelle,
nobody's gonna cause any trouble.
I mean, would you wanna be
on the bride's bad side?
I can't imagine you're eager
to welcome that girl into the family.
I'm not.
This all happened
a little too quickly for my liking.
But Shawn won't talk to me about it.
I must have left him 20 messages.
I was thinking about going to see him
after we finish work today.
Just make sure Bridezilla
is out of earshot.
- I have to.
- Have to?
You're about to get married, Shawn.
You should want to.
- What's going on? Is she pregnant?
- No. No, nothing like that.
Is she forcing you?
Look, Shawn,
if you're feeling trapped,
if you're looking
for a way out of this,
just tell me, I can help.
Help? Uncle Tommy,
I'm not in front of a firing squad.
I'm getting married.
People do it all the time.
Come on, Shawn.
You're marrying lsabelle.
She's a very dangerous girl.
I happen to know that.
Okay, I know all about her too.
So don't think
you're gonna surprise me.
I appreciate you coming down here.
I know you mean well.
This marriage, it is the right thing.
The right thing for who?
For everybody.
Man, they just cannot keep anything
working around here.
This always happens
when I work late.
You know, I don't even know
where the stairs are in this place.
Oh, right down here.
Come on, I'll show you.
So do you always work past 8?
Most nights, yeah.
Trying to get ahead, you know?
Dedication, I like that.
You could accomplish great things.
Her name was Paula Nakata.
She was a lawyer at a firm
in the building.
My God, the poor woman.
That's two bodies
in less than 24 hours.
It doesn't make any sense.
Most spree killers, they have a type.
But Tim McCarren and Paula Nakata
could hardly be more different.
A prostitute
and a corporate attorney.
Why would someone
target these two?
And why is she labeled 1 1?
The numbers on the bodies
are working backwards.
It looks like we might have
a partial print on the wedding band.
It's probably from the victim,
but you never know.
Let's hope whoever did this
slipped up.
Because I don't think he's anywhere
close to finished yet.
We were so close.
We were gonna save everything.
Isabelle changed you.
You don't even know
who you are anymore.
She didn't change me.
She showed me who I am.
I know myself better than ever.
And I know exactly
what has to happen here.
Don't do this.
Shawn.
Marco? Did you go home last night?
No, I was working on your case.
It got late.
- Cold.
- We got a message
you wanted to talk to us?
Yeah, the print that they pulled
from Paula Nakata's wedding band
wasn't hers.
Does it match the one we found
on Tim McCarren's body?
It does indeed. The print belongs
to a man named Darren Piersahl.
Piersahl? I've never heard of him.
I'm not surprised.
See, he is not a 4400.
Well, then he's not the murderer.
Marco, you saw both bodies.
A 4400 killed these people.
It certainly looks that way.
The fingerprint match
wasn't from our database.
It was from U.S. military records.
Piersahl was an Army Ranger
for seven years.
- Was? What's he doing now?
- Not much.
According to Army records,
Darren Piersahl is dead.
He was killed in action
in lraq in 2005.
I'm wondering,
how could an Army sergeant
who's supposedly been dead for a year
be using a 4400 ability
to kill people in present-day Seattle?
Darren always wanted to be
a Ranger.
It was his dream,
ever since he was old enough to read.
I encouraged it.
I spent 20 years in the service myself.
So when Darren signed up it was like
carrying on the family legacy.
Why is NTAC so interested
in my son's death anyway?
It's part of an ongoing investigation,
Mr. Piersahl.
Please, anything you could tell us
would help.
Not long before he died,
I got a letter from Darren.
He was excited.
Said he'd been accepted
into this elite training unit.
He couldn't tell me much about it, just
that it meant he was being transferred
off the frontlines
and out of harm's way.
And he was killed in action
soon after that?
Two weeks later.
The Army told me
he'd been flying a recon mission
in an OH-58 helicopter.
Got hit by an RPG.
They never did find his remains.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Piersahl.
But you said the Army told you
he was flying a recon mission.
Did you have any reason
to doubt that?
Well, I thought
the timing was peculiar.
I mean, I'd just got this letter from him
saying he was done fighting.
So I did some checking.
There were six soldiers reported dead
in the crash that killed my son.
And why is that unusual?
Because an OH-58
flies with a crew of four.
It can't hold six people.
A secret training program?
A death
under suspicious circumstances?
There's something off here.
Even the kid's dad knows it.
It's weird, I'm not denying it.
But let's just take our time
with this, okay?
There are other explanations
that don't involve cover-up.
Someone could've planted Piersahl's
fingerprints at the crime scene.
Who knows? It could be a 4400,
someone who can mimic
other people's fingerprints.
Maybe, but if you're trying to frame
someone, why pick a dead man?
Baldwin. Where?
We'll be right in.
They just found another body.
I'll let you all in
on a little family secret.
My brother and l
haven't always seen eye to eye.
So we didn't talk for a while.
I went to college,
he became the most famous person
in the world.
But it's all good,
because he's a great guy.
And I'm really proud of him.
I think we all are.
So congratulations, man.
I couldn't be happier
to see you walk the plank.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
Is there anything
you'd like to say, Daddy?
Toast. The father of the bride
wants to speak.
Shawn, lsabelle.
I have to say, I had my doubts.
But my daughter
has managed to overcome them.
She was determined
to make this marriage happen,
and here we all are.
Shawn, she couldn't have picked
a better partner.
I'm proud to call you my son.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
So where are you guys going
on your honeymoon?
You know, we haven't really
figured that out yet.
If you'll all please excuse me.
Stay.
You keep charming the in-laws,
I'll see what's up.
Isabelle?
You saW me die? You're sure?
I killed you.
And, Richard, I swear to God,
it looked like I was enjoying it.
The whole reason I'm marrying lsabelle
is to keep her attached, normal.
That's not what happens.
I don't make her more human,
she makes me less human.
I have to try something. I have to go,
I have to see if it changes anything.
- Gonna walk out on the wedding?
- Maybe, I don't know.
I'm getting out of here,
and then I'm gonna see what happens.
If you leave now, it's not gonna
make lsabelle very happy.
- It might not be easy to come back.
- I know that.
But I have to do it.
Just tell them I'm sick or something.
I'm sorry.
Just tell them something, okay?
Her name was Holly Martins.
She was a housewife in Madison Park.
- The pool man found her body.
- Was there a note?
Ninety-two?
How many people
is this guy targeting?
Guys, I figured out what
all these corpses have in common.
All the victims
had the same mutation?
We did a genetic workup
on all three corpses.
Every one of them has a slight
alteration of the 1 1 th chromosome.
It's called the Starzl Mutation.
That could be a coincidence.
Not likely.
The Starzl Mutation's extremely rare.
The only documented cases
are in the Seattle area.
You see,
there's two kinds of mutations.
Some occur naturally.
You know, something goes wrong
when the body's building itself.
Others are induced.
The genes are changed
by external factors.
- And the Starzl Mutation is induced.
- That's right.
Starting in 1 969,
Seattle Presbyterian Hospital
used a flawed radiation machine
to treat their cancer patients.
You know, the microswitches that
controlled the thing weren't working.
The dosages were all off.
- How long did this go on?
- Under five years.
Once the hospital figured out
what they were doing,
they tested everyone
who had ever been exposed to it.
In some cases,
the radiation induced a small mutation.
The Starzl Mutation.
Yeah, they named it after the company
that made the bad machine.
And the mutation's replicable.
You know, people who got it
passed it on to their kids,
which includes our three victims.
They were living normal lives.
They were healthy.
Hey, just like most mutations,
you can have it and not even know.
After everything went public,
the lawyers came out to play.
There was a class-action lawsuit.
Seattle Presbyterian paid
a huge settlement
to everyone who was affected
by the machine.
They almost went bankrupt.
So Darren Piersahl,
who's supposed to be dead,
is targeting carriers
of the Starzl Mutation,
which only occurs around Seattle,
and has absolutely no effect
on its carriers.
Okay, but why?
Excellent question.
When you find out,
make sure you tell me.
If there was a lawsuit,
there's a paper trail.
I'll bet you that hospital keeps
a master list of everyone they paid.
- You okay? You okay?
- Shawn, you should stop healing me.
No, you're gonna make it,
Uncle Tom.
No, no, Shawn, I'm not.
This is all my fault.
I should never have
talked you out of marrying lsabelle.
No, that was my decision, not yours.
I can't help thinking that
it didn't have to end this way.
Everyone we love is dead.
I'm sorry. The catastrophe's here.
Hey, no, no, no.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.
No, let me go.
Let me go, let me go.
Save as many as you can, Shawn.
You're lucky. Until six weeks ago,
I hadn't pulled that file in years.
If you'd asked me then,
it would've taken me hours.
What happened six weeks ago?
Oh, some guy in a suit showed up.
Had a document with him
saying that the military needed the file
for research in the war on terror.
Yeah, there we go.
There it is. That's the master list
of everyone we paid in the Starzl case.
This man, can you tell me his name?
Yeah.
Miles Enright.
Why, you know him?
Not yet.
There's 1 23 people here.
A hundred and twenty-three
we know have the mutation.
Numbers we've been finding
on the dead bodies
correspond to where
they appear on the list.
Number 27, Timothy McCarren.
Number 1 1, Paula Nakata.
And Holly Martin's 92.
So Darren Piersahl,
if he's the killer,
is working from the same list
we're holding.
But the order seems so random.
I mean, is he just killing them
as the opportunity arises
or is there some method?
I'll try and find a pattern.
Hey, how's Maia been?
She's okay.
She asks about you a lot.
Yeah?
I just checked out Miles Enright.
He's the vice president of Research
and Development at Haspel Corp.
Dennis.
You've been ignoring our calls.
I'm busy, Tom.
Why don't you go
through my assistant?
- Maybe we can talk next week or so.
- It's important, Ryland.
It's about Darren Piersahl
and your company's program
to create a division of the U.S. military
with 4400 abilities.
I don't know, Tom. I've been
working here less than three months.
I still don't know
where the supply closets are,
and now you've got me
heading up a covert program
where I'm injecting promicin
into United States soldiers?
Six weeks ago, the vice president
of Research and Development
acquired a list of everyone
with the Starzl Mutation.
- Miles Enright. Maybe you know him?
- Sorry, it's a big building.
- I haven't shaken everybody's hand.
- Three people are dead.
Now, you need to tell us everything
you know about Darren Piersahl
so we can bring him in
before he kills anyone else.
I've never heard of him.
And I've certainly never heard of this,
what do you call it?
Starzl Mutation?
This is your last chance to cooperate
before we find Piersahl.
If you help us now, we'll make it look
better for your company later, Dennis.
Well, how can I help you when I have
no idea what you're talking about?
Now, if this program existed--
And please, understand
I'm not saying it does.
--you seem to think
that people would be shocked
to know that it's out there.
Me, I think they'd be grateful.
I think any good citizen
would be thankful
that his government
was working on this.
Because you can be damned sure
our enemies are.
If everyone would be so happy,
why not just tell us about it?
As usual, you have no idea
of what the stakes are.
Whoever controls promicin
has a strategic advantage
over the rest of the world.
This is another
Manhattan Project, Tom.
And they didn't close it down
because a couple of technicians
got radiation poisoning.
They kept on working,
and they were right to do that.
It's made the world a better place.
Not that you're admitting
that the program exists, right?
What program?
So if I go through with it,
if I marry lsabelle,
you and I become enemies,
I kill you.
If I don't do it, Richard,
things are even worse.
They're-- People are dead.
A lot of people.
In the second vision, your uncle said
the catastrophe was here, right?
That place looked like a war zone.
What the hell am I supposed to do?
Look, you can only deal
with the information you have.
In one future, I die.
In another,
it sounds like thousands of people,
maybe millions, are at risk.
- That's no choice at all.
- We're talking about your life.
The guy said each vision
was one possible future.
If you do marry lsabelle, at least
we go into it with our eyes open.
Now that we know what could happen,
we can change things.
Nothing's inevitable, right?
Let's hope not.
Because believe me...
... I don't wanna die.
Meet Staff Sergeant John Shaffner.
Okay, so why are we meeting him?
He was one of six fatalities
in the helicopter crash
that "killed" Darren Piersahl.
- A helicopter that seated only four.
- Right.
It turns out John Shaffner's family
never received his remains either.
You know, there was really
a helicopter crash that day in lraq,
but four families got
their kids' bodies back, two didn't.
Here's what I'm thinking--
Piersahl and Shaffner were recruited
into Haspel Corp's training program
at the same time.
So they used the crash
to fake two deaths.
So that Piersahl and Shaffner
could disappear into the program
with impunity.
So we have a second member of
Haspel Corp's program, which is great.
But it doesn't get us
any closer to Darren Piersahl.
Good point. It doesn't, really.
Not until...you look
at Shaffner's dog tags.
This is Shaffner's
military serial number.
Look familiar?
Should it?
Twenty-seven. That's what the note
we found on Tim McCarren said.
That's also where
we found his name
on the list of people
with Starzl Mutation.
Eleven.
That was Paula Nakata's number.
And Holly Martins was 92 on the list.
There is a pattern.
He's picking the order
based on his buddy's serial number.
Okay, but why?
Maybe it's a message.
Maybe they're doing it together.
But if he's consistent, the next victim
will be number 38 on the Starzl list.
Alex Messina.
I already checked him out.
He manages a bike store in Madrona.
Yeah. Yeah, I recognize him.
He was in here earlier today.
- Did he say anything to you?
- It was kind of weird, actually.
He asked me
if my name was Alex Messina.
And he said it like that.
You know, the full name.
He wanted to know if I could
come out and take a look at his bike.
He needed to replace a part,
and I told him just to bring it in.
He said he'd come back
when we were less busy.
Send a tactical team over right away.
Thanks.
If Piersahl makes a move,
we'll be ready.
Tom.
Must be from Piersahl.
Hey.
Do you like this color?
This place needs to be a little
more girlie if I'm gonna be living here.
Yeah, it looks great.
I think so too.
I'm glad you're back.
If Piersahl knows we're onto him
he'll change his pattern of attack.
There's a dozen people
we can't find.
Hope we get to them
before Piersahl does.
Tom Baldwin?
Yeah, who's asking?
My name is John. John Shaffner.
I was a volunteer in the same program
Darren Piersahl was in.
- The one that drove him crazy.
- Yeah, we know who you are.
- And we know about the program.
- Good.
Then you're ready to hear
what I have to say.
We were volunteers, all of us.
I still remember the sales pitch.
We'd be the elite,
a new type of soldier.
We had to give up our lives,
forfeit our identities.
They said it was the only way.
The program had to operate
in complete secrecy.
When did you start
getting the injections?
Right away. Started slow,
but about three weeks ago,
they started upping our dosages.
- That's when guys started to lose it.
- Where did they get the promicin?
I don't know, but they seem
to have plenty of it though.
Darren was the first one
who could do stuff, you know?
An ability.
He killed one of the instructors
by mistake.
- It freaked him out.
- You two escaped together?
Once we got out, we pretty much
went our separate ways.
I had no idea he was gonna do this.
So he's AWOL?
These murders
aren't sanctioned by anyone?
No, Darren's freelancing.
That's why they want him back so bad.
He's compromising the program.
Our C.O.s, they told us
about the Starzl Mutation.
They told us it could be a threat,
but they never told us to kill anybody.
Then what is it?
Why does Darren
want them dead so badly?
Got something to do with babies.
So far, any time a 4400
has a kid with a member
of the regular population,
their babies are normal.
They don't make promicin,
they don't have abilities.
We know,
we've been tracking the births.
But the Starzl Mutation
changes all that.
If a 4400 has a kid
with someone who has the mutation,
the baby would be promicin-positive.
- They'd have abilities.
- How would the military know that?
- Have they tried it?
- I don't know,
but they seem
pretty goddamn sure it's true.
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but Darren is a victim here too.
They gave us so many stimulants.
They amped us up to kill,
and he snapped.
Don't know if he thinks
he's on a mission or something,
but I know he needs
to be stopped.
I'll do whatever I can
to help you find him.
So, What do you think you knoW?
Everything.
Including the Starzl Mutation.
And I have to give you credit.
If what you say is right,
it would explain why the 4400
were sent back in 2004.
Why they were all brought
to Seattle.
This is the only place the 4400 can
reproduce and have kids with abilities.
Any of this sound familiar?
I think I read the same theory
in a supermarket tabloid once.
We know about your enhanced
soldier program, Dennis.
We have one of your people.
John Shaffner been showing up
for many roll calls lately?
Well, as soon as we have Piersahl,
we're going public with this,
and there's nothing
you can do to stop that.
All you can do is make yourself
and this company look slightly better
by cooperating with our efforts
to bring him in.
We want Piersahl's personnel file.
Everything you have.
If it's not in my hands
in 90 seconds,
John Shaffner will be standing in front
of a bank of cameras before lunch.
This could be something. Maybe.
It reads like some kind
of personal statement.
An essay by Piersahl.
Yeah, we had to do those
to get in the program.
They wanted us to write
about some goal we achieved,
something we were proud of.
This is all about a volunteer program
that he did.
There was a patch of forest
that got cleared by a fire.
Piersahl volunteered to renew it
so that he could become a--
Darren Piersahl
was an Eagle Scout?
Yeah, he used to talk
about those woods all the time.
When we were in the middle
of the program,
whenever things got really bad,
he used to tell me
that's where he'd go in his head.
He'd imagine himself there,
it calmed him down.
This patch of forest,
any chance you know where it is?
Maybe you could put your arm
around her, Mr. Tyler.
That's great.
The magazine wants to get
a shot of the bride and groom.
Has anyone seen the groom?
Who gave you the key?
Your own bodyguard.
You started a war, Richard.
You turned the 4400 into an army,
and you launched an attack
for no reason!
We didn't have a choice.
It had to be a preemptive strike.
No choice. Look what you're doing.
Look at it. It has to stop.
Isabelle changed you.
You don't even know
who you are anymore.
She didn't change me.
She showed me who I am.
I know myself better than ever.
And I know exactly
what has to happen here.
Don't do this.
Shawn...
Shawn.
Sorry to barge in on you, it's just...
They need you down in the garden.
Pictures.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just...
...a little overwhelmed.
Darren?
Darren.
Darren, you out here?
What are you doing here?
Darren, relax, man.
It's me, Shaffner.
John, we're friends, remember?
Shaff.
You came. That's good.
That's good, I need your help.
I'm never gonna make it
all the way through this list on my own.
Darren, you don't have to finish the list.
It's someone else's agenda.
You got it all mixed up in your head.
Come on with me,
there's people I want you to talk to.
They can help us.
They? Who are they?
It's gotta stop, man. Please.
Come with me.
- No. No.
- Wait.
We got people covering
the access road, we'll pin him down.
Fan out!
Oh, Jesus. Tom!
I can't see anything.
Tom.
Tom!
Tom?
We lost Shaffner, Piersahl's dead.
He was on his way out
before we even started fighting.
Piersahl had a stab wound
in his stomach.
I guess Shaffner didn't go down
without a fight.
Yeah. Well, they're both gone.
And there's no one left
to talk about the program.
We still have evidence.
We can go after Haspel Corp.
Expose everything.
Yeah, but it would have been nice
to have a face to put out there.
Now all we have are accusations
and a paper trail.
And five dead bodies.
Hey, you guys gotta see this.
We are proud
to announce the existence
of this enhanced-soldier program
to all the World,
but it should not, in any Way,
be seen as an offensive maneuver,
We have evidence suggesting that
other countries have similar programs.
This is merely a response,
The young men I'm about to introduce
to you have been Working in secret,
and We've made
numerous advances,
In time, they'll become
the first non-4400s
to develop extra-human abilities,
and they'll use them
in the defense of the United States,
NoW I'd like to introduce
eight heroic young men,
all of Whom have given
so much of themselves
to make this breakthrough possible,
Ryland's preempting us.
Trotting them out there on-stage
like they're the first astronauts.
Major Jeremy ElWood,
First Lieutenant Raymond Garcia,
First Lieutenant Jeff Rice,
First Lieutenant Brian DaWson,
Second Lieutenant James Noland,
Second Lieutenant Dirk Danoff,
The press conference
was a clever move, Dennis.
I have to give credit where it's due.
But this company
has five bodies on its hands.
And I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows it.
Knows what?
We're not denying anything.
It's unfortunate that one of my men
went AWOL,
but he was clearly deranged.
And I've got a whole team of doctors
standing by to testify to that effect.
You created an assassin.
It's a tragedy.
And it's news, I'll admit that.
But tomorrow morning,
the Piersahl case
will be below the fold
on every newspaper.
And all the headlines
will be about our program.
That's the way I see it, anyway.
Wait, who's feeding you
your information?
You knew about the Starzl Mutation
before we did.
You have a source
of promicin for your program.
Who is it?
You give me too much credit, Tom.
That stuff happens
way above my security clearance.
The soldiers you're creating,
are you really gonna use them
to defend the country?
Or are you just gonna send them
after the 4400?
Is there a difference?
Enjoy your nephew's wedding.
You sure you're ready for this?
Come on, you look ready.
Let's do this.
Hello there.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks, kids.
Thank you for coming so much.
Thank you for being here.
Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming so far.
Thank you.
I appreciate your coming all this way.
Thank you so much.
Shawn. Shawn Farrell.
Do you know who I am?
Durant les 60 dernières années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées.
Toutes sont revenues en même temps.
Sans aucun souvenir d'où elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des nouvelles capacités.
Toutes essayent de reprendre...
... une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans Les 4400...
La frontière Canadienne est à environ
50 km d'ici.
Vous devriez passer dès que vous
le pouvez. Ryland est après vous.
Je n'ai jamais voulu que cela finisse
entre nous, Thomas.
Jamais.
Je trouverai le moyen de te
ramener. Je te promets.
- April !
- Surprise ?
Comment ça va, soeurette ?
Jordan, tu viens de me dire qu'il
y a une petite fille là-dehors
sachant prédire l'avenir,
et qui t'a vu mort.
Dois-je m'éloigner du centre ?
Dois-je m'exiler ?
Même si tu avoues, Kyle,
il ira quand même en prison.
Tu essayes d'enterrer ce genre
de choses, ça te change.
Nous devons nous marier.
C'est la seule manière d'être sûrs
que nous ne nous perdrons jamais.
Shawn !
Shawn Farrell !
Sais-tu...
qui je suis ?
Laissez-moi passer !
Jordan !
Jordan !
Laissez-nous passer !
Jordan !
Jordan !
Avez-vous vu Jordan Collier
passer par-là ?
- Non, Monsieur.
- Cheveux longs, une barbe.
Personne ?
Tu l'as bien vu toi, pas vrai ?
Oui.
Ecoute, je veux qu'on sécurise
la zone.
Personne ne rentre ou ne sort
sans ma permission.
Allez.
Ok, les gars.
Au boulot.
Nous avons cherché dans tous
les coins,
et on n'a trouvé personne.
Tu es sûr qu'il s'agissait de Collier ?
C'était lui. Il m'a regardé
droit dans les yeux.
Il m'a parlé.
Il lui ressemblait vraiment,
mais je ne l'ai vu que pendant
une seconde.
S'il est à pied, il n'a pas pu
aller bien loin.
Je pense que nous devrions appeler le
NTAC, les faire ratisser le voisinage.
Shawn ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
La cérémonie aurait dû commencer
il y a 20 minutes.
Richard, je viens de voir Jordan.
Il est vivant. Il est ici.
Quoi ?
Où ça ?
Ecoute, Shawn. Diana et moi
devons y aller. Ok ?
Eh, non, non, non, non.
- Je viens avec vous.
- Quoi ?
Je vais vous aider à le retrouver.
Jordan a changé maintenant.
Je suis le plus apte à le
reconnaître.
Shawn, tu es au beau milieu de ton
mariage.
Tu as plus de 1000 invités là...
Les médias...
Isabelle.
Tu vas devoir contrôler les
dégâts.
Dis à Isabelle que le mariage
n'est pas annulé...
seulement retardé...
et que j'irai la voir dès que
je le peux.
Je suis désolé.
On peut y aller ?
Papa, qu'y a-t-il ?
Je croyais que nous étions d'accord.
Je ne veux pas te voir.
Ca ne pouvait pas attendre,
Kyle.
Il est vivant.
Jordan Collier est vivant.
Je vais le retrouver, Kyle,
et je vais te faire sortir de là.
C'est bon ma chérie.
Tout va bien se passer.
Je compatis à ta douleur.
Tout ira bien.
Ne vous en faites pas pour moi.
Shawn, Dieu merci.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Tous les invités sont partis.
Tout le monde croit que tu t'étais
enfui.
Ca va... je dois parler à
Isabelle une seconde...
si ça ne te dérange pas.
Donc, ton "papa" est revenu, hein ?
Ton père t'a dit à propos
de Jordan.
Oui.
J'étais vraiment curieuse de savoir...
pourquoi je n'allais pas
me marier.
Je suis désolé, Isabelle.
Vraiment.
Jordan est quelque part là-dehors.
Je dois le trouver.
Et après ?
S'il est vivant, qu'est-ce que ça
change pour toi et moi ?
Je ne sais pas trop.
Jordan était mort et aujourd'hui
il ne l'est plus...
Shawn, le mariage est-il annulé...
ou non ?
Il va toujours avoir lieu.
Seulement pas aujourd'hui, et
pas tant que je ne saurai pas
ce qui se passe avec Jordan.
Je sais que Collier signifie beaucoup
pour toi.
Pour tout le monde ici.
Trouve-le.
Di...
April, oh mon Dieu !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
Je suis venu voir ma soeur.
Dis-moi, tu n'aurais pas une
sorte d'allergie
qui t'empêche d'appeler pour
prévenir ?
Je n'étais pas sûre que ce soit
une bonne idée.
Si j'avais appelé,
tu aurais pu refuser de me voir.
Donc, tu vas embrasser ta soeur unique,
ou vas-tu juste me claquer la
porte au nez ?
Je suis désolée.
C'est juste...
tu m'as surprise c'est tout.
Je ne savais même pas que tu
étais à Seattle.
J'y déménage.
Pourquoi ?
Tu as des ennuis ?
Non ! Je suis amoureuse.
Je sais ce que tu penses...
"toujours la même chose"...
mais pas cette fois.
Ce type est le bon.
Oh, c'est... c'est génial.
Je suis très heureuse pour toi.
Attends de l'avoir rencontré,
ce qui devrait se faire dans une minute.
Il est en train de garer la voiture.
April, je suis en plein milieu d'un
truc pour le boulot.
Ca ne sera pas long.
Seulement 2 minutes.
S'il te plaît ?
Ca me ferait très plaisir.
Je parie que Maia serait
contente, aussi.
Tante April !
Quelqu'un grandit vite ici.
Regarde-toi.
On dirait un top model.
Je parie que les garçons
le pensent aussi.
Maia, voici mon ami Ben.
J'ai beaucoup entendu parler
de vous, jeune demoiselle.
Ta tante dit que tu es
une fille très spéciale.
Peut-être un peu.
Désolé, je suis au milieu
d'affaires importantes.
J'avais dit à April
que nous aurions dû appeler avant.
Tu vois ? Poli.
Et si tu fais une fouille au corps,
tu ne trouveras aucun
piercing nulle part.
April a dit que tu es photographe.
Euh, oui.
April et moi rentrons
tout juste d'Inde.
Je faisais un reportage sur
le système de castes là-bas.
C'est pour une exposition qu'il organise
au musée d'art contemporain.
Vraiment ?
Wow.
Eh bien... Oui.
J'ai passé quelques temps
en Inde
quand j'étais étudiante.
Nous faisions une étude
épidémiologique
dans la région des Nilgiri.
C'est là où nous étions.
Eh bien, vous avez bien
de la chance.
C'était si magnifique.
Je me levais tôt pour voir le soleil
se lever derrière les collines.
Oui, j'ai quelques clichés des
lever de soleil,
pour ma collection personnelle.
Si j'avais su que cela vous
intéressez,
je les aurai amenés.
- J'adorerais les voir.
Je les amènerai.
J'ai vraiment hâte,
mais pour le moment,
je dois vraiment me dépêcher.
Au revoir.
Au revoir.
Ravi de vous avoir rencontré.
Moi aussi.
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
Tu as raison.
C'est le bon.
C'est une belle maison.
Collier a un goût certain pour les
propriétés.
C'est vrai quoi...
C'est le sixième endroit que
nous visitons aujourd'hui ?
Ca doit être sympa d'avoir
tout cet argent.
Diana...
Regarde ça.
Quelqu'un vit ici.
Les gars.
Cela vient d'une soupe populaire
en ville.
Que dit le carnet ?
Il est plein.
"La ville est grande de plusieurs
milliers de kilomètres.
"La dernière ville.
"Les murs sont hauts de plus
de 30 mètres.
"Plus rien ne pousse à
l'extérieur,
"Alors les gens supplient
de les laisser rentrer,
"mais personne n'écoute."
Que des trucs comme ça.
C'est écrit de la main de Collier ?
C'est juste une première analyse,
mais j'ai comparé l'écriture
du carnet
avec l'extrait écrit par Collier
que vous m'avez donné.
Elles ne se ressemblent en rien.
L'écriture du carnet est tordue,
comme si l'auteur était malade,
mais le logiciel affirme que ce
sont quasiment les mêmes.
Alors Jordan a écrit ce truc ?
Je ne peux pas l'assurer,
mais il y a un labo
à Washington.
On pourra nous confirmer ça.
Mais c'est possible ?
Jordan est en vie.
Bien, nous n'en savons rien
pour le moment.
Je peux vous dire une chose...
s'il a bien écrit ça,
alors il a vu des choses intéressantes
pendant son absence.
Encore et toujours à propos
d'une ville murée.
Vous savez, une élite privilégiée
qui vit à l'intérieur.
Tout le reste
n'est que désolation.
Oh, et les dernières pages
ne sont qu'une phrase
répétée sans cesse.
"La guerre pour le futur
sera menée dans le passé."
Maman ?
Oh.
Tu m'as fait peur.
Désolée.
Je n'arrive pas à dormir.
Oh, d'accord...
Pourquoi ne viendrais-tu pas ici ?
Je vais te préparer un
bol de glace.
Notre famille va devenir plus
grande maintenant.
Oh, chérie...
Ne prète pas trop attention
au fait que ta tante April
vive à Seattle.
Tu sais comment elle peut être.
Ce n'est pas ça.
Tu vas te marier.
Je l'ai vu.
Dans pas longtemps.
Tu n'auras pas changé quand ça
va arriver.
Je vais me marier ?
N'est-ce pas chouette ?
Tu vas être si heureuse.
Ok, eh bien, euh...
As-tu vu qui était le chanceux ?
Ouais.
Cet homme qu'on vient juste de rencontrer.
Ben.
Maia...
Tu m'as vu me marier
avec le petit ami de ma soeur ?
Mm-hmm.
Mais Ben est avec tante April !
Je suppose qu'ils ne
resteront pas ensemble,
parce que vous deux
allez vous marier.
Tu vas avoir un mari.
Je vais avoir un papa.
Ce n’est pas super ?
Allô ?
Oh, salut, Tom.
Non...
Nous sommes éveillées.
Avez-vous vu cet homme ?
Oui.
Je suis bénévole à la cuisine
de St Alban.
Des types ont apporté le
portrait robot
quand nous fermions ce soir.
Nous y servons de la nourriture
deux fois par semaine.
Je l'ai vu.
- Vous en êtes sûre ?
- Certaine.
Je me souviens de lui parce que les autres
le laissent toujours passer devant.
Ils s'écartent de son chemin.
Je n'ai jamais vu ça avant.
Mais vous ne l'avez pas vu aujourd'hui.
Pas depuis quelques semaines,
mais je l'ai toujours vu manger
avec Will.
Will est un peu le doyen par ici.
Il sait tout sur tout le monde.
Oui, je le connais.
Nous le connaissons tous.
Le prêtre.
"Le prêtre" ?
Il n'a jamais dit que son vrai nom
était Jordan Collier.
Je pensais que Collier était mort.
Qui êtes-vous, de toutes façons ?
Nous sommes du NTAC.
Nous devons trouver cet homme.
Quand l'avez-vous vu pour
la dernière fois ?
A l'instant.
Il est ici ?
Il est toujours ici.
C'est plutôt désert.
Vous êtes sûr qu'il est revenu ici ?
Il ne va jamais nulle part.
Ok...
Dites "bonjour"...
au Prêtre.
Vous l'avez peint ?
Pas moi,
mais le Prêtre est un
homme populaire.
Il raconte des histoires
incroyables.
Il prétend avoir vu le futur.
Les gens par ici...
Nous le croyons.
Tu m'as menti, Isabelle.
Je ne me rappelle pas beaucoup
de quand j'étais un bébé.
Toi et maman, principalement.
Des choses floues.
Je me souviens de Collier.
Je me souviens
ce qu'il vous a fait subir,
et je me souviens de ce que j'ai ressenti
la fois où il a touché maman.
Tu lui avais donné de quoi s'en souvenir.
Il a mis des mois à s'en remettre.
Ce n'est pas la seule chose
que je lui ai fait.
Juste avant de mourir,
il est venu me parler.
Je sais que ça semble étrange...
Je n'étais qu'un bébé...
mais il voulait que je lui dise
s'il devait
continuer d'organiser sa réception.
Je m'en souviens.
Il avait demandé à aller te
promener dans les jardins.
Il voulait... le pouvoir.
Il voulait être acclamé,
un nom qui perdurerait après sa mort.
Donc c'est ce que je lui ai montré.
C'est-à-dire ?
Tu lui as donné une vision ?
Il a fait sa réception.
Il a été tué.
Je n'ai pas appuyé sur la gâchette,
mais papa, j'ai fait en sorte
que ça arrive.
Si Collier est revenu,
il sait ce que j'ai fait.
Que veut-il ? Se venger ?
Nous ne savons même pas
s'il est vraiment en vie.
Et s'il dit à Shawn
ce que j'ai fait ?
Tu as l'air d'avoir peur de Collier.
Isabelle...
Collier est un homme puissant...
mais il n'est qu'un homme.
Il n'était qu'un homme.
Nous ne savons pas
ce qu'il est maintenant.
Les gars, j'ai quelque chose
que vous devez voir.
Vous vous souvenez de ce graffiti,
celui qui ressemble à Collier ?
Bien, il y a une base de données
nationale des graffitis.
J'y ai soumis le portrait.
Et ?
Ce prêtre ?
Il se balade.
Celui-ci à Saint Louis.
El Paso.
Tempe, Arizona,
Reno...
Il y en a de tous les pays.
Si c'est bien Collier,
alors il a été très occupé.
Il aurait besoin d'un rasage et d'une
coupe, mais il a toujours du charisme.
Il a des fidèles partout.
Alors, quoi ?
Il voyage...
prêchant le gospel du futur ?
As-tu bientôt fini ?
J'allais te préparer un casse-croûte.
- Encore cinq minutes.
- Ok.
As-tu vu Ben aujourd'hui ?
Tu parles du petit ami de
ta tante April ?
Non, je ne l'ai pas vu,
et je ne le verrai pas.
Ton antenne ne fonctionne pas
bien cette fois-ci, ma puce.
Ok.
Salut.
Euh...
Ecoute, je ne suis pas le genre de type
qui débarque tout le temps
à l'improviste, je te le jure...
Ok.
Mais j'étais juste dans le coin.
Je n'avais pas ton numéro
de téléphone.
La photo dont nous avions parlée ?
Oh.
Merci.
Euh...
Entre.
- Salut, Maia.
- Salut, Ben.
Je vais aller travailler
dans ma chambre.
Vous allez discuter.
Euh, bon, tu l'ouvres ?
Ca te dis quelque chose ?
Ce sont les monts Nilgiri.
Ouais.
Ecoute...
Ca n'arrivera pas.
Excuse-moi ?
Mariés ?
- Es-tu sûre qu'elle parlait de moi ?
- Uh uh.
Hé bien, ça ne peut pas arriver.
Je suis contente que tu sois d'accord.
April m'a parlé de ce
que Maia peut faire
Mais elle se trompe ici, non ?
Oh, c'est bien ça.
Ok, um...
Je vais y aller...
Et plus de visite pour
t'apporter de photos.
Plus de visite, point.
Ok, bien...
J'ai été ravi de faire
ta connaissance...
Et d'avoir décidé de ne plus te revoir.
Oui, ravie également.
<i>Est-ce que vous m'avez tué ?</i>
<i>C'est lui. </i>
<i>C'est lui.</i>
<i>C'est Jordan Collier !</i>
C'est Jordan Collier !
<i>Dites-leur que je ne vous ai pas tué !</i>
<i>Dites-leur que vous êtes Jordan Collier !</i>
Dites-leur !
Dites-leur que vous êtes Jordan Collier.
Dites-leur !
C'est bien comme ça que je m'appelle ?
Quand vous êtes venu voir Kyle,
Vous avez signé en tant
que Jeffrey Paulson.
Pourquoi ?
J'ai trouvé une carte de bibliothèque
dans la poche de ma veste,
et c'est ce qui était écrit.
J'ai pensé...
Je pensais que c'était peut-être mon nom.
Votre nom est Jordan Collier.
Vous ne vous rapellez pas ?
Vous êtes un 4400.
Vraiment ?
On vous a tiré dessus.
Vous êtes mort.
Ah...
Oui, j'ai vu ça dans les journaux.
Je pensais que
je ressemblais à cet homme.
Vous avez disparu.
Est-ce que vous avez une idée
d'où vous avez pu aller ?
Partout.
J'ai été partout.
Je suis vivant depuis des centaines
d'années, peut-être des milliers.
Je ne pouvais parler à personne.
Je...
J'errais.
Ni nourriture,
ni repos...
Et j'observais tout.
J'ai vu le monde...
changer...
et il devenait de plus
en plus mauvais.
et le ciel se remplissait de fumée...
et toutes les machines
s'arrêtaient de travailler,
et les rues,
et les rivières...
étaient pleines de corps.
La mort...
était partout.
La Terre...
pleurait...
et cela...
ne s'arrêtait jamais.
Les choses dont vous parlez,
n'ont pas eu lieu.
En tout cas, pas encore.
Nous sommes en 2006.
Cela fait moins d'un an
qu'on vous a abattu.
Comment est-ce possible ?
J'erre depuis si longtemps.
C'est le rapport préliminaire de test ADN.
L'homme que nous tenons est Jordan Collier
Bien, au moins
quelqu'un est sûr de ça.
J'ai besoin de Collier,
lui rappeler qui il est.
pour qu'il aller devant un juge et
demander la libération de mon fils.
Mais Tom,
c'est déjà une victoire pour Kyle.
Collier est vivant.
Donc il purge une peine
pour tentative de meurtre
au lieu de meurtre ?
Non, non, non, Diana.
Ce n'est pas assez.
Ecoute, Collier sait qui il est.
C'est enterré quelque part.
Il s'est montré au mariage.
Il s'est réfugié dans une de ses
propriétés personnelles.
Nous devons trouver un moyen
qu'il se rappelle de tout ça.
Tom, je viens d'avoir un coup de fil avec
le conseiller de la sécurité nationale.
Il veut organiser
une conférence téléphonique
avec lui, moi,
et les chefs du personnel
pour discuter du fait
que Jordan Collier
est en quelque sorte
revenu des morts.
Et vous voulez que je considère
l'autre moyen que Alana Mareva
une fugitive, se promène au NTAC
et utilise son pouvoir sur Collier ?
Elle peut avoir accès à sa mémoire.
Lui montrer sa vie.
Ces gens à Washington,
ils ont besoin que Collier se rappelle
qui il est, n'est-ce pas ?
Ils ont besoin de réponses.
C'est peut-être le seul moyen d'en avoir.
Nina, s'il vous plaît...
C'est de mon fils qu'il est question.
Vous avez un moyen de rentrer
en contact avec Alana ?
Appelez-la.
J'y vais, Maia.
Tu ne pouvais pas supportez
de me voir heureuse, n'est-ce pas ?
April, de quoi parles-tu ?
Qu'as-tu dis à Ben ? Hein ?
Qu'est-ce que tu lui as dis, Diana ?
Rien. Pourquoi ?
Il a rompu avec moi !
Tu n'étais pas supposé
rompre avec elle.
Ce n'est pas pour ça que je t'ai
raconté ce qu'a dit Maia.
J'en ai conscience.
Mais tu dois comprendre.
Une voyante vient de me dire
que j'étais avec la mauvaise personne,
et quand tu sais que
tu es avec la mauvaise personne...
Pourquoi rester avec elle ?
Je ne sais pas.
Peut-être parce que tu l'aimes.
J'aime April.
Enfin, je le pensais du moins...
Je n'arrive pas à comprendre comment
tu peux prendre ça autant à la légère.
Peut-être parce que tu vis avec une 4400.
Mais quelqu'un m'a dit que j'avais
rencontré la personne, la femme,
avec qui je suis supposé être.
Je ne peux pas l'ignorer.
Tu sais, j'aimerais que tu
me dises la vérité.
Quand tu me regardes,
tu ne ressens rien du tout ?
Une attirance ?
Un soupçon d'attirance ?
Oui.
Je la ressens.
Tu m'as demandé la vérité,
donc, oui, je le ressens.
et si je t'avais rencontré
d'en d'autres circonstances,
oui, j'aurais...
j'aurais voulu te revoir.
Oui.
Moi aussi.
Mais cela n'a pas d'importance.
Nous ne pouvons pas faire cela.
Oui, je sais.
Je suis venu prendre
les affaires de ma soeur et partir.
Mais cela ferait quoi si...
nous tentions de nous accorder
une petite part de bonheur ?
Salut, Thomas.
Tu as coupé tes cheveux.
Je n'arrive pas à croire que tu sois là.
Merci de faire ça.
Pour Kyle, je ferais n'importe quoi.
Tu le sais.
En plus, tu m'as manqué.
Tu es prête ?
Vous n'avez rien à faire.
Fermez juste vos yeux et
détendez-vous.
Vous ne sentirez rien.
Je vous le promets.
<i>Je m'appelle Jordan Collier. </i>
Si je pouvais rester ici
pendant un moment...
Tu es l'un des 4400.
Ce bébé peut être la clef du futur.
Peter a tout le temps qu'il faut.
Salut, Peter.
Je m'appelle Jordan Collier.
Salut, Richard.
Bienvenue dans la révolution.
Collier, est-ce que tout va bien ?
Je m'appelle Jordan Collier.
Je sais pourquoi ils nous
ont renvoyés.
J'ai vu la catastrophe, et je sais
ce que l'on doit faire pour l'arrêter.
Tu dis que tu as toutes ces réponses.
Dis-nous ce qu'elles sont
et ensuite nous envisagerons
de te libérer.
Vous saurez ce que je sais
en même temps que tous les autres.
Quand le saurons-nous ?
Dès que je serais libre, vous
et le monde saurez ce que je sais.
Et que se passera-t-il si nous
vous détenons indéfiniment ?
J'ai l'habitude d'attendre.
Oui, bien, je ne peux pas.
Mon fils est en prison.
Vous êtes le seul qui puisse le faire sortir.
Donc vous souhaitez ma libération
autant que je le veux.
Votre fils Kyle est innocent.
C'est un pion.
Et je dirais ce que vous voulez...
dès que je suis un homme libre.
Je n'arrive pas à y croire, Nina.
Mon fils pourrait être à une
comparution en justice de la libération,
et vous refusez de laisser
Collier témoigner de son plein gré ?
Pas moi.
Le Pentagone.
Leur position officielle est que
Collier n'est pas encore revenu.
Allez, Nina.
Ils ne croient pas honnêtement
qu'ils peuvent étouffer ça ?
Bien, ils vont essayer.
Ecoute, le retour de Collier change tout.
Nous ne parlons pas seulement
de la galvanisation des 4400.
Ils forment un groupe religieux
à travers le monde
qui va le considérer comme le Messie
Peu importe ce qu'il dit,
peu importe combien il est fou,
les gens vont écouter.
Donc peut-être que nous devrions
découvrir ce qu'il a dans la tête
avant que nous le collions
devant une armée de micros.
Et que se passera-t-il si
nous n'aimons pas ce qu'il a à dire ?
On l'enferme dans un sous-sol,
et prétend que rien ne s'est passé ?
Je ne pense pas que ce
sera de notre ressort.
Je serais surprise si Collier
n'est pas transféré hors d'ici
avant demain.
Ils devraient être là
à l'heure qu'il est.
Tu es sûre que tu vas bien ?
Oui.
Quand j'ai touché Collier,
ces choses que j'ai vues...
Elles n'étaient pas seulement de son passé.
Il y avait d'autres images aussi.
Elles étaient terribles.
C'était comme un cauchemar.
Je ne sais pas comment Collier a pu
vivre avec ça sans devenir fou.
Je ne veux pas te quitter, Thomas.
Je ne veux plus être une fugitive.
Peut-être que tu n'y
seras pas obligée.
Ce que tu as fait aujourd'hui,
ça a aidé le NTAC.
Si je leur dis qu'ils peuvent
utiliser ton abitilité,
peut-être qu'ils laisseront tomber les
charges retenues contre toi.
Je ne blesserai jamais un 4400...
Je sais.
Je sais.
Si on réussit, tout redeviendra
comme avant, ok ?
Oncle Tom.
Attends là.
Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je ne t'ai pas aidé à le retrouver
pour que tu puisses l'enfermer.
Shawn, ils ont peur.
C'est la réaction typique du gouvernement
lorsqu'ils ont peur.
Tu sais, si on voulait,
on pourrait aller le chercher.
Si on s'y prépare bien,
on s'introduit dans le NTAC,
et rien ni personne ne
pourrait nous arrêter.
Tu as peut-être raison...
Mais il pourrait y avoir un autre moyen.
Tiens.
C'est une image... provenant d'une
caméra de sécurité du NTAC.
Elle a été prise cet après-midi.
Vous la montrez à tout le monde.
Vous faites savoir au monde entier que
Collier est de retour.
Merci.
Ouais.
Des biscuits "Wagon Wheel" ?
Je ne mangeais quasiment que ça
quand j'étais à la fac.
Ben...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Eh bien, je mange moi aussi.
Alors...
Qu'est-ce que tu en penses ?
Coïncidence ? Ou ceci devait arriver
quoiqu'il advienne ?
Eh bien en temps normal,
je te ferai un cours sur le libre arbitre,
mais je dois l'avouer,
ça sonnerait un peu faux.
Bien, nous sommes tous les deux ici.
Nous faisons tous les deux nos courses.
Tu veux te joindre à moi ?
J'adore faire le plan final.
Laisse-moi deviner...
Portrait de personnes âgées.
Les feux rouges.
A chaque fois que je m'arrêtais
à un feu rouge,
je prenais une photo.
Hum-hum.
On devait étudier ces carrefours
que personne ne remarque jamais.
Comme les magasins, les gens..
Les poubelles...
Huh.
Tout.
C'est très créatif.
Je ne faisais que traîner
dans les alentours.
Non, j'aimerais vraiment les voir.
Ok, ouais, je pense qu'ils doivent
traîner quelque part chez moi.
Non...
Attends.
Quoi ?
On ne peut pas faire ça.
On vient juste de le faire.
C'était un rendez-vous,
et un plutôt réussi.
Non, ce n'est pas vrai.
C'était sympa,
mais ce n'était pas un rendez-vous.
Alors pourquoi je crois
que ça en était un ?
Tu dois l'admettre,
ça aussi c'était sympa.
Je peux te revoir ?
<i>Libérez Collier !</i>
<i>Libérez Collier !</i>
Quelqu'un d'autre croit
que c'est la Prise de la Bastille ?
Eh bien, on dirait le commencement
de quelque chose.
Nous devons le laisser partir.
C'est soit ça ou soit on appelle du renfort.
On ne va pas rester là à regarder
des émeutes pour des 4400.
Il y a des membres du Clergé dehors.
Des citoyens.
Ecoutez, on ne peut pas se
contenter de fermer les yeux.
Si Collier est un genre de Messie,
il doit être libéré.
Et si ce n’est pas le cas,
le laisser sortir est encore la
meilleure chose à faire.
Ce qui lui causerait
énormément d'ennuis.
Je vais appeler Washington.
Mais ils vont vouloir savoir
comment ces gens ont pu avoir une
photo de Collier entre leurs mains.
Aucune idée de ce que je
devrais leur répondre ?
Si, dites-leur que c'est difficile
de cacher une résurrection.
<i>Libérez Collier !
Libérez Collier !</i>
<i>Libérez Collier !
Libérez Collier !</i>
<i>Libérez Collier !</i>
Libérez Collier !
Libérez ....
C'est bien toi.
Bon retour parmi nous, Jordan.
Merci d'avoir garder le centre sur
les rails pendant mon absence.
Richard...
Je suis content que tu sois
encore parmi nous.
Tu vas avoir un rôle important
à jouer dans tout ça.
Je me tiens là...
Et je vois l'avenir.
4400 et non-4400 travaillant main
dans la main, dans un but commun.
Sauver l'humanité n'est plus
seulement le problème des 4400.
Chacun et chacune d'entre vous
aura un rôle à jouer ...
Et il commence maintenant.
Nous allons aller au tribunal.
Nous devons libérer un homme innocent.
Ecoutez, éloignez juste ces personnes
de ce bâtiment.
Vous empêchez ma cour
de faire son travail.
Ils ne partiront pas avant que vous
ayez écouté ce que j'ai à dire.
J'annule officiellement toutes les
charges retenues contre Kyle Baldwin
pour mon présumé meurtre.
Eh bien, Monsieur Baldwin a tout de même
agressé deux agents fédéraux.
Maintenant, il a utilisé une puissante arme à feu,
dans une foule de personne,
Et il a confirmé tout ceci dans
une confession très détaillée.
Mon fils est en prison depuis des mois.
C'était sa toute première
condamnation.
Vous pouvez le libérez avec un sursis.
Ces gens dehors,
ils m'écoutent.
Ils seront là chaque jour jusqu'à que
le fils de cet homme soit libre.
Bien, ce sont des circonstances
inhabituelles, je vous l'accorde.
Peut-être que nous pouvons
revoir le jugement pour meurtre.
Faites-le. Rapidement.
Merci.
Je croyais que tu ne
voulais pas me voir.
Oh, je ne veux pas.
Je suis venue voir tes photos.
Oh.
Eh bien, ok,
je savais que tu serais là.
Eh bien, pourquoi tu es venue ?
J'ai réfléchi à propos de l'autre jour
à l'épicerie,
Et...
J'ai pensé également que c'était
un rendez-vous sympa.
Ca ne s'est juste pas bien terminé.
Ok...
Et comment cela aurait-il dû se finir ?
Salut, maman.
Salut.
Où tu étais, Di ?
Nulle part.
J'ai juste...
dû travaillé tard.
Je suis désolée.
Je suis tellement désolée
Ne t'excuse pas.
Ces choses que tu as vues en moi...
Fierté, ambition, vanité...
Elles étaient présentes.
Je devais mourir pour
les faire disparaître.
J'ai fait de mauvaises choses...
Et je suis sensée en faire plus.
Je sais.
Et j'essaye de lutter.
Dis-moi ce que je dois faire.
Je ferais n'importe quoi.
Pars.
Quitte le centre des 4400,
et ne reviens plus jamais.
Rien ne peut changer ce que tu es, Isabelle.
Tu es l'ennemie des 4400,
l'ennemie du bien.
Et cette partie humaine
qui est en toi...
est tellement plus petite
que la partie qui ne l'est pas,
que ta tentative de vouloir
la garder en vie échouera.
Non.
Non.
J'ai le choix.
Les autres peut-être. Pas toi.
Si c'est vrai.
Si nous sommes ennemis,
alors pourquoi ne vous
tuerais-je pas maintenant ?
Tu peux toujours essayer,
mais ça ne marchera pas.
Je suis prêt cette fois.
Cet endroit est redevenu mien...
Et tu n'y es pas la bienvenue.
Au revoir, Isabelle.

Over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted
All at once they were returned
With no memory of
where they've been
They haven't aged a day
And some have returned
with new abilities
All are trying to reconnect...
...with a life interrupted
<i>We're not a threat.
We're salvation.</i>
The world will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>
the canadian border's
about 30 miles away.
I'd cross as soon as you can.
Ryland will be looking.
I didn't want us to end, thomas.
Ever.
I'll find a way
to bring you back, i promise.
April!
Surprised?
How's it going,
sibling?
Jordan, you just told me
there's a little girl out there
who can see the future, and she saw you dead.
Do i stay away from the center?
I cut myself off?
Even if you confess, kyle,
he is still going to jail.
You try to bury stuff like this,
it changes you.
We have to get married.
It's the only way we can be sure we'll
never lose each other.
Shawn!
Shawn farrell!
Do you know who i am?
Get out of the way!
Jordan!
Jordan!
Let us through!
- Jordan!
Jordan!
Did you see jordan collier
come through here?
No, sir.
- Long hair, beard.
Anyone?
You saw him, right?
Yeah.
Look, i want
this place secure.
No one gets in or out
until i say different.
Come on.
All right, guys,
let's look around.
Guys, we've been
all over the grounds,
and we can't find anybody.
Are you sure it was collier?
It was him.
He looked right at me.
He talked to me.
It did look like him,
but i only saw him
for a second.
Well, if he's on foot,
he can't have got far.
I think we should call ntac, get them
to sweep the neighborhood.
Shawn ?
What's going on?
The ceremony was supposed to start
20 minutes ago.
Richard,
i just saw jordan.
He's alive. He's here.
What?
Where?
Look, shawn, me and diana
have to get moving, okay?
Hey, no, no, no, no.
I'm coming with you.
- What?
I'm going to help you
find him.
Jordan looks different now.
I'm the one who got
the best view of him.
Shawn, you're in the middle
of your wedding.
We've got
a thousand guests here...
The media...
Isabelle ?
You're going to have to do
some damage control.
Tell isabelle that the wedding's
not off...
It's just postponed...
And I... And I'll come see her
as soon as i can.
I'm sorry.
Are we ready to go?
Daddy, what is it?
I thought we agreed.
I don't want to see you.
This couldn't wait, kyle.
He's alive.
<i>Jordan collier is alive.</i>
I'm going to
find him, kyle,
<i>and i'm going to get you
out of here.</i>
It's okay, sweetie.
It's going to be okay.
I just feel so bad for you.
I'll be fine.
You don't need
to worry about me.
Shawn. Thank god.
What happened?
All the guests are gone.
Everybody thinks
you walked out.
That's...
it's okay. I just...
i need to talk to isabelle
for a second...
If you don't mind.
So, your "daddy" came home, huh?
Your dad told you
about jordan?
He did.
I was really curious as to
why i wasn't getting married.
I'm sorry, isabelle.
I am.
Jordan's out there somewhere.
I need to find him.
And then what?
If he's alive, what does
that mean for you and me?
I'm not sure.
Jordan was dead,
and now he's not...
shawn, is the wedding off...
or isn't it?
It's still going to happen.
Just not today, and not until
i figure out
what's going on with jordan.
I know
collier means a lot to you.
To everyone here.
Find him.
Di...
April, my god,
what are you doing here?
I came to see my sister.
Tell me, do you have some kind of allergy
that keeps you
from calling ahead?
I wasn't sure
that was a good idea.
If i called,
you might have refused
to see me.
So, are you going to hug
your only sister,
or are you going to
shut the door in my face?
I'm sorry. I just...
you surprised me, that's all.
I mean, i didn't even know
you were in seattle.
I'm moving here.
Why?
Are you in trouble?
No! I'm in love.
I know what
you're thinking...
"same difference"...
but not this time.
This guy's the keeper.
Oh, that's... that's great.
I'm really happy for you.
Well, wait till you meet him.
Which should be any minute now.
He's parking the car.
April, i'm in the middle
of something for work.
It won't take long.
Just a couple of minutes.
Please?
It'd mean a lot.
I bet you
maia would be happy, too.
Aunt april!
Someone's getting tall.
Look at you.
You're like a supermodel.
I bet the boys
think so, too.
Maia, this is
my friend ben.
I heard a lot about you, young lady.
Your aunt says you're a very special girl.
Maybe a little.
Sorry, i'm in a bit
of a rush.
I actually told april
we should have
called ahead.
See? Polite.
And if you did
a body search,
you wouldn't find a piercing
anywhere.
April mentioned
that you're
a photographer.
Uh, yeah.
April and i just
got back from india.
I was doing a piece
on the caste system there.
It's all for a show
he's putting on
at the museum
of contemporary art.
Really?
Wow.
Well...
- Yeah..
I spent some time
in india
when i was
a graduate student.
We were doing
an epidemiology study
in the nilgiri range.
We were there.
Well, you are
so lucky.
It was so beautiful.
I used to wake up early
so i could watch
the sun come up
over the foothills.
Yeah, i've got some shots
of the sunrises,
just for my own
personal collection.
If i'd known
you were interested,
i'd have brought them by.
- I'd like to see them.
I'll bring them by.
I look forward to it,
but right now,
i really got to rush.
Bye.
Bye.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
Bye.
- Bye.
You're right.
He is a keeper.
This is a nice place.
Collier sure had an eye
for real estate.
I mean, what,
this is the sixth place
we've looked at today?
Must be nice to have
that kind of money.
Diana...
look at this.
Someone's been staying here.
Guys.
It's from a soup kitchen
downtown.
What does
the notebook say?
The whole thing's full.
"The city is
a thousand miles wide.
"The last city.
"The walls
are a hundred feet high.
"Nothing grows
on the outside anymore,
"so the people
beg to be let in,
but nobody listens."
It's all like this.
Is that collier's handwriting?
This is just preliminary,
but i ran the handwriting
from the notebook
against the sample
from collier's
that you gave me.
Now, they don't
look alike at all.
I mean, the handwriting
from the notebook
is shaky,
almost like
whoever did it is sick,
but the software says
that they're a probable match.
So jordan wrote this stuff?
I can't say for sure,
but there's a lab
in d.c.
That'll be able to give us
a positive identification.
But it's probable, right?
Jordan's alive.
Well, we don't know that yet.
I'll tell you
one thing...
if he did write this,
he has seen
some interesting stuff
while he's been gone.
The whole thing
goes on and on
about a walled city.
You know,
a privileged elite
lives on the inside.
Everything else
is just a wasteland.
Oh, and then the last few pages
are just one phrase
repeated
over and over again.
"The war for the future
will be fought in the past."
Mommy?
Oh.
You scared me.
Sorry.
I couldn't sleep.
Oh, well...
why don't you come on in.
I'll make you
a bowl of ice cream.
Our family's
going to get bigger now.
Oh, sweetie...
don't get too attached
to the idea
of your aunt april
living in seattle.
You know how she can be.
That's not it.
You're going to get married.
I saw it.
Not too long
from now.
You look the same
when it happens.
I'm getting married?
Isn't it great?
You're going to be
so happy.
Okay, well, um...
did you happen to see
who the lucky guy was?
Yeah.
It was the man we just met.
Ben.
Maia...
you saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?
Mm-hmm.
But ben is with aunt april.
I guess
they don't stay together,
'cause you two are going to
get married.
You're going to
have a husband.
I'm going to have a dad.
Isn't that the best?
Hello?
Oh, hey, tom.
No...
we're up.
Have you seen this man?
Sure.
I volunteer at
st. Alban's kitchen.
These guys brought
the sketch by
when we were
closing up tonight.
We bring food down here
twice a week.
I've seen him.
You sure about that?
Positive.
I remember him
because everyone else
always lets him go
to the front of the line.
They get
out of his way.
I've never seen that before.
But you haven't seen him today.
Not for
a couple of weeks,
but i always see him
eating with will.
Will's kind of
the elder statesman around here.
He knows just about everyone.
Yeah, i know him. We all do.
The preacher.
"The preacher"?
He never said his real name
was jordan collier.
I thought collier was dead.
Who are you guys, anyway?
We're from ntac.
We need to
find this man.
When's the last time
you saw him?
Just now.
He's here?
He's always here.
It's pretty empty.
You're sure
he's back here?
He never goes anywhere.
Okay...
say hello...
to the preacher.
You made
a painting of him?
Not me personally,
but the preacher's
a popular guy.
He's got some amazing stories.
The guy claims
to have seen the future.
People around here...
we believe him.
You lied to me, isabelle.
I don't remember much
about being a baby.
You and mom, mostly.
Vague stuff.
I remember collier.
I remember
how he made you guys feel,
and i remember how i felt
when he touched mom that time.
You gave him something
to remember that day.
Collier was recovering
for months.
That's not the only thing
i did to him.
Right before he died,
he came to talk to me.
I know it sounds weird...
i was just a baby...
but he wanted me to tell him
whether it was safe
to go ahead with the party
he was planning.
I remember.
That's when he asked to take you for a walk
through the gardens.
He wanted... power.
He wanted acclaim.
A name that would live on
after he died,
so that's what i showed him.
So, what,
you gave him a vision?
He had the party.
He got shot.
I didn't pull the trigger,
but daddy,
i made that happen.
If collier's back,
he knows what i did.
What does he want? Revenge?
We don't even know
whether or not he is alive.
What if he tells shawn
what i did?
You sound like you're
scared of collier.
Isabelle...
Collier's a very powerful man...
but he is just a man.
He was just a man.
We don't know what he is now.
Guys, i've got something
you need to check out.
You know that graffiti mural,
the one that might be collier?
Well, there's a national
graffiti database.
I ran the portrait
against it.
And?
This preacher guy?
He gets around.
That one's
from st. Louis.
That's el paso.
Tempe, arizona,
reno...
these are from
all over the country.
If this is collier, he's been a very busy man.
He might need a shave and a haircut,
but he's still got charisma.
He's got followers everywhere.
So, what, he's traveling around,
preaching the gospel of the future?
Are you almost done?
I was going to
make you a snack.
Five more minutes.
- Okay.
Did you see ben today?
You mean
your aunt april's boyfriend?
No, i didn't see him,
and i'm not going to see him.
Your antenna is not working right
on this one, sweetie.
Okay.
Hi.
Hum...
look, i'm not the type of guy who drops
by unannouncedall the time, i promise...
Okay...
But i was just in
the neighborhood.
I didn't have your phone number.
The pictures we talked about?
Oh.
Thanks.
Um, come in.
Hi, maia.
Hi, ben.
I'm going to go to my room
to study.
You two talk.
Um, so,
you going to open it?
Does it look
familiar?
That's
the nilgiri hills.
Yeah.
Listen...
this is not going to happen.
Excuse me?
Married?
Are you sure
she meant me?
Uh-huh.
Well, that can't happen.
I'm glad you agree.
April told me about maia
and what she can do,
but she's wrong here, right?
Oh, she's going to be.
Okay, um...
i'm going to go...
And no more visits
to bring you pictures.
No more visits, period.
Okay, well...
it was nice
meeting you...
and then resolving
never to see you again.
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.
<i>Did you kill me?</i>
<i>That's him.</i>
<i>That's him!</i>
<i>That's jordan collier!</i>
That's jordan collier!
<i>Tell them i didn't kill you!</i>
<i>Tell them
you're jordan collier!</i>
Tell them!
Tell them you're
jordan collier!
Tell them!
is that who i am?
When you went
to see kyle,
you signed in
as jeffrey paulson.
Why?
I found a library card
in the pocket of my coat,
and that's what it said.
I thought...
i thought
maybe that was my name.
Your name
is jordan collier.
You don't
remember that?
You're one of the 4400.
Am i?
You were shot.
You died.
Ah...
Yes, i saw that in the papers.
I thought i looked
like that man.
You disappeared.
Do you have any idea
where you've been?
Everywhere.
I have been everywhere.
I've been alive for hundreds of years,
maybe thousands.
I couldn't speak to anyone.
I just...
i wandered.
No food, no sleep...
And i watched it all.
I watched the world...
change...
and it just kept
getting worse...
and the skies
filled with smoke...
and all the machines
stopped working,
and the streets,
and the rivers...
were filled
with bodies.
The dead...
were everywhere.
The earth...
cried out...
and it...
it never stopped.
The things you're talking about,
they haven't happened.
Not yet, anyway.
It's 2006.
It's been less than a year
since you were shot.
How could it be?
I've been wandering
for so long.
That's the preliminary
dna report.
That man we're holding
is jordan collier.
Well, at least
somebody's sure of it.
I need collier to remember who he is
so he can stand
in front of a judge
and ask for my son to be freed.
But tom, this is
already a win for kyle.
Collier's alive.
So he serves a term
for attempted murder
instead of murder?
No, no, no, diana.
That's not good enough.
Look, collier knows who he is.
It's buried in there somewhere.
He showed up at the wedding.
He found his way
to one of his safe houses.
We just need to find a way
to help bring it all
to the surface.
Tom, i just got off the phone
with the national security
advisor.
He wants to schedule
a conference call
with him, me,
and the joint chiefs of staff
to discuss the fact
that jordan collier
is somehow
back from the dead,
and you want me
to look the other way
while alana mareva, a fugitive, walks into ntac
and uses her ability on collier?
She can access his memories.
Show him his life.
These people in d.c.,
they need collier to remember
who he is, too, right?
They need answers.
This might be the only way
to get them.
Nina, please...
Come on.
We're talking about my son.
You have a way
to get in touch with alana?
Make the call.
I got it, maia.
You just couldn't stand
to see me happy, could you?
April,
what are you talking about?
What did you say to ben? Huh?
What did you say, diana?
Nothing. Why?
He broke up with me!
You weren't supposed
to break up with her.
That's not why
i told you what maia said.
I realize that,
but you have to understand,
a precog just told me
that i was
with the wrong person,
and if you know
you're with the wrong person...
why stay with her?
I don't know.
Maybe because you love her.
I do love april.
At least,
i thought i did.
You know, i can't believe how casual
you can be with all this.
Maybe it's because
you live with a 4400.
But someone just told me
that i met the person,
the woman,
that i'm supposed to be with.
I can't ignore it.
You know, i want you
to tell me the truth.
When you look at me,
do you feel anything at all?
An attraction?
An inkling of an attraction?
Yes.
I do.
You asked
for the truth,
so, yes, i do.
and if i met you
under different circumstances,
yes, i'd...
i'd want to see you again.
Yeah.
Me too.
But it doesn't matter.
We can't do it.
Yeah, i know.
I'm going to take my sister's
stuff and go.
But wouldn't it be something
if we were giving up
our shot at happiness?
Hello, thomas.
You cut your hair.
I can't believe
you're here.
Thank you
for doing this.
For kyle, i'd do anything.
You know that.
Besides, i missed you.
You ready?
You don't have to
do anything.
Just shut your eyes
and relax.
You won't feel anything.
I promise.
<i>My name's jordan collier.</i>
If i could stay here
for a while...
you're one of the 4400.
That baby could be the key
to the future.
Peter has all the time
in the world.
Hi, peter.
My name is jordan collier.
Hello, richard.
Welcome
to the revolution.
Collier, are you all right?
My name is jordan collier.
I know why they sent us back.
I saw the catastrophe,
and i know what we have to do to stop it.
You say you have
all these answers.
Tell us what they are,
and then we can talk,
about letting you out of here.
You'll learn what i know
when everyone else does.
When will that be?
As soon as i am free,
you and the world
will know what i know.
And what if we hold you
indefinitely?
I've grown accustomed
to waiting.
Yeah, well, i can't.
My son is in prison.
You're the only one
who can get him out.
Then you want me released
as badly as i do.
Your son kyle
is innocent.
He is a pawn,
and i will say that
to whomever you want...
the moment i am a free man.
I can't believe this, nina.
My son could be one court
appearance away from freedom,
and you're refusing to let
collier testify on his behalf?
I'm not refusing.
The pentagon is.
Their official position is,
collier's not even back.
Come on, nina.
They can't honestly believe
that they can squash this.
Well, they're
going to try.
Look, collier's return
changes everything.
We're not just talking about
galvanizing the 4400.
There are
religious groups
all over the world
who would consider him
the messiah.
No matter what he says,
no matter
how crazy it is,
people are going to listen.
So maybe we should find out
what's on his mind
before we stick him in front
of a bank of microphones.
And what if we don't like
what he has to say?
We stick him in the basement,
pretend this never happened?
I don't think
that's going to be our decision.
I'd be surprised
if collier's
not transferred out of here
by this time tomorrow.
They should be here by now.
You sure you're okay?
L-i will be.
When i touched collier,
those things i saw...
they weren't only
from his past.
There were other images, too.
Terrible ones.
It was like a nightmare.
I don't know
how collier
lived through it
and stayed sane.
I don't want to leave you,
thomas.
I don't want
to go on the run again.
You know, maybe
you don't have to.
What you did today,
it helped ntac.
If i tell them
they can have access
to your ability,
maybe they'll drop the charges
against you.
I'd never hurt the 4400...
I know.
I know.
Maybe we can work it
so you don't have to.
Okay?
Uncle tommy.
Wait right here.
What the hell's
going on?
I didn't help you find jordan
so you could lock him away.
Shawn, they're scared.
This is how the government reacts
when it's scared.
You know, if we wanted,
we could take him.
If we set our minds
to it,
we can get into ntac,
and there won't be
anything you can do to stop us.
You may be right...
but there might be another way.
Here.
That's a still
from a security camera at ntac.
It was taken
this afternoon.
You show it
to everyone.
You let the world know
that collier's back.
Thank you.
Yeah.
wagon wheel.
You know, i used to
live on those things in college.
Ben...
what are you
doing here?
Well, i eat, too.
So...
what do you think?
Coincidence? Or is this thing going to happen
whether we try to stop it
or not?
Well, normally,
i'd give you a lecture
about free will right now,
but i have to admit,
it might sound a little hollow.
Well, we're both here.
We're both shopping.
Want to join forces?
I loved doing
the final project.
Let me guess...
faces of the elderly.
Red lights.
Every time i stopped
at a red light,
i'd take a picture.
Mm-hmm.
You had to study
these intersections
that you never
really noticed.
Like, the stores,
the people,
the garbage cans...
huh.
Everything.
That's very creative.
I was just
screwing around.
No, i would like
to see them.
Okay, yeah, i think
i've got them somewhere.
No...
wait.
What?
We can't do this.
We just did.
That was a date,
and that was
a pretty good one.
No, it wasn't.
It was nice,
but it wasn't a date.
Then why do i feel
like doing this?
You got to admit,
that was nice, too.
Can i see you again?
<i>Free collier now!</i>
<i>Free collier now!</i>
Anyone else feel
like it's bastille day?
Well, it does feel
like the start of something.
We have got to let him go.
It's either that
or bring in troops.
And we won't just be
reading the riot act to 4400s.
There's clergy out there.
Citizens.
Look, we can't just sit on this.
If collier
is some kind of messiah,
he needs to be free.
If he's not,
letting him out
is still the right move.
It would give him enough rope
to hang himself.
I'll call d.c.,
but they're going to
want to know
how those people
got their hands
on a picture of collier.
Any idea what
i should tell them?
Yeah, tell them it's hard
to cover up a resurrection.
<i>Free collier now!
Free collier now!</i>
<i>Free collier now!
Free collier now!</i>
<i>Free collier now!</i>
Free collier now!
Free collier...
It's you.
Welcome back, jordan.
Thank you
for keeping the center alive
while i was gone.
Richard...
i'm glad to see you
still with us.
You'll have
an important role to play.
I stand here...
and i see the future.
4400s and non-4400s
working hand in hand
toward a common goal.
Saving humanity
is no longer
the exclusive province
of the 4400.
Each and every one of you
will have work to do...
and the work starts now.
We're going to the courthouse.
There is an innocent man
who needs to be freed.
Look, just get those people
away from this building.
You're impeding
the business of my court.
They won't leave
until you listen
to what i have to say.
I hereby withdraw
any and all charges
against kyle baldwin
for my alleged murder.
Well, Mr. Baldwin
still assaulted
two federal agents.
Now, he fired a high-powered weapon
into a crowd of people,
and he admitted it all
in a detailed confession.
My son has been in jail
for months.
He's a first-time offender.
You could release him
with time served.
Those people out there,
they listen to me.
They will be back every day
until this man's son goes free.
Well, these are
highly unusual circumstances.
I'll grant you both that.
Perhaps we can revisit
the murder plea.
Do. Quickly.
Thank you.
I thought
you didn't want to see me.
Oh, i don't.
I want to see your pictures.
Oh.
Well, okay,
so i knew you'd be here.
Well, then why'd you come?
I guess i've been thinking
about the grocery store,
and...
i thought
it was a good date, too.
It just didn't end right.
Okay...
and how should it
have ended?
Hey, mommy.
Hi.
Where you been, di?
Nowhere.
I just...
had to work late.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Don't apologize.
Those things you saw in me...
pride, ambition, vanity...
they were there.
I had to die
to lose them.
I've done bad things...
and i'm supposed to do more.
I know.
And i'm trying not to.
Tell me what to do.
I'll do anything.
Leave.
Leave the 4400 center,
and never come back.
Nothing you can do will change
what you are, Isabelle.
You are the enemy
of the 4400,
the enemy of everything
that is good,
and that part of you that is human...
It is much smaller
than the part of you that's not,
and your struggle to keep it
alive will fail.
No.
No.
I have a choice.
Others might. Not you.
If that's true,
if we're enemies,
then why shouldn't i
just kill you right now?
You're welcome to try,
but it won't work.
I'm ready for you this time.
This place is mine again...
And you're not
welcome here.
Goodbye, Isabelle.
Transcript : www.1000fr.com
Synchro : FRM@mywsz, Benj!.
We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
The Canadian border
is about 30 miles away.
Cross as soon as you can.
Ryland will be looking.
I didn't want us
to end, Thomas. Ever.
I'll find a way to bring you back.
I promise.
- April.
- Surprised?
How's it going, sibling?
Jordan, you just told me
there's a little girl there
who can see the future,
and she saw you dead.
So I stay away from the Center,
I cut myself off.
Even if you confess, Kyle,
he is still going to jail.
If you try to bury stuff like this,
it changes you.
We have to get married.
It's the way we can be sure
we'll never lose each other.
Shawn! Shawn Farrell!
Do you know who I am?
Get out of the way! Jordan!
Jordan! Let me through! Jordan!
Jordan!
Did you see Jordan Collier
come through here?
- No, sir.
- Long hair, beard. Anyone?
You saw him, right?
Yeah. Look,
I want this place secure.
No one gets in or out
until I say different.
- Come on.
- All right, guys, let's look around.
Guys, we've been all over the grounds
and we can't find anybody.
Are you sure it was Collier?
It was him. He looked right at me.
He talked to me.
Well, it did look like him,
but I only saw him for a second.
Well, if he's on foot, he can't be far.
I think we should call NTAC,
get them to sweep the neighborhood.
Shawn. What's going on?
The ceremony was supposed
to start 20 minutes ago.
Richard, I just saw Jordan.
- He's alive. He's here.
- What?
- Where?
- Shawn.
- Me and Diana have to get moving.
- Hey, no, no, no.
- I'm coming with you.
- What?
I'm gonna help you find him.
Jordan looks different now.
- I got the best view of him.
- You're in the middle of your wedding.
We got a thousand guests here,
the media, lsabelle.
You're gonna have to do
some damage control.
Tell lsabelle
that the wedding's not off,
it's just postponed, and I'll come
see her as soon as I can.
I'm sorry.
Are we ready to go?
Daddy, what is it?
I thought we agreed
I don't want to see you.
This couldn't wait, Kyle.
He's alive.
Jordan Collier is alive.
I'm gonna find him, Kyle,
and I'm gonna get you out of here.
It's okay, sweetie. It's gonna be okay.
I just feel so bad for you.
I'll be fine. You don't need
to worry about me.
Shawn. Thank God. What happened?
All the guests are gone.
Everybody thinks you walked out.
That's-- It's okay. I just--
I need to talk to lsabelle
for a second, if you don't mind.
So your daddy came home, huh?
- Your dad told you about Jordan?
- He did.
I was really curious as to why
I wasn't getting married.
I'm sorry, lsabelle. I am. It's--
Jordan's out there somewhere.
I need to find him.
And then what? If he's alive,
what does that mean for you and me?
I'm not sure.
- Jordan was dead and now he's not.
- Shawn, is the wedding off or isn't it?
It's still gonna happen,
just not today.
And not until I figure out
what's going on with Jordan.
I know Collier means a lot to you,
to everyone here.
Find him.
Di.
April, my God,
what are you doing here?
I came to see my sister.
Tell me, do you have
some kind of allergy
that keeps you from calling ahead?
I wasn't sure that was a good idea.
If I called, you might have
refused to see me.
So are you gonna hug
your only sister
or are you gonna
shut the door in my face?
I'm sorry, I just--
You surprised me, that's all.
I mean, I didn't even know
you were in Seattle.
- I'm moving here.
- Why? Are you in trouble?
No, I'm in love.
I know what you're thinking:
"Same difference."
But not this time.
This guy's the keeper.
Oh, that's great.
I'm really happy for you.
Well, wait till you meet him,
which should be any minute now.
He's parking the car.
April, I'm in the middle
of something for work.
It won't take long.
Just a couple minutes, please.
It would mean a lot.
I bet you Maia would be happy too.
- Aunt April.
- Someone's getting tall.
Look at you.
You're like a supermodel.
I'll bet the boys think so too.
Maia, this is my friend Ben.
I heard a lot about you,
young lady.
Your aunt says
you're a very special girl.
Maybe a little.
Sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush.
I actually told April
we should have called ahead.
See? Polite.
And if you did a body search,
you wouldn't find a piercing anywhere.
April mentioned
that you're a photographer.
Yeah, April and l
just got back from lndia.
I was doing a piece
on the caste system there.
It's all for a show he's putting on
at the Museum of Contemporary Art.
Really?
- Well...
- Yeah.
I spent some time in lndia
when I was a graduate student.
We were doing an epidemiology study
in the Nilgiri range.
We were there.
Well, you are so lucky.
It was so beautiful.
I used to just wake up early to watch
the sun come up over the foothills.
Yeah, I got some shots of sunrises.
Just for my personal collection.
If I'd known you were interested,
I'd have brought them by.
- I'd like to see them.
- I'll bring them by.
I look forward to it.
But right now I really gotta rush.
Bye.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
- Bye.
- Bye. You're right, he is a keeper.
This is a nice place.
Collier sure had an eye
for real estate.
I mean, what, this is the sixth place
we've looked at today?
It must be nice
to have that kind of money.
Diana, look at this.
Someone's been staying here.
Guys.
It's from a soup kitchen downtown.
What does the notebook say?
The whole thing's full.
"The city is a thousand miles wide.
The last city.
Walls are a hundred feet high.
Nothing grows
on the outside anymore,
so the people beg to be let in,
but nobody listens."
- It's all like this.
- Is that Collier's handwriting?
This is just preliminary,
but I ran the handwriting
from the notebook
against the sample from Collier's
that you gave me.
Now, they don't look alike at all.
I mean, the handwriting
from the notebook's shaky,
almost like whoever did it is sick.
But the software says
that they're a probable match.
- That Jordan wrote this stuff?
- I can't say for sure,
but there's a lab in D.C. that'll be able
to give us a positive identification.
But it's probable, right?
Jordan's alive.
- We don't know that yet.
- Yeah, I'll tell you one thing.
If he did write this,
he has seen some interesting stuff
while he's been gone.
And the whole thing goes on and on
about a walled city.
You know, a privileged elite
lives on the inside,
everything else is just a wasteland.
And then the last few pages
are just one phrase
repeated over and over again.
"The war for the future
will be fought in the past."
Mommy?
- You scared me.
- Sorry.
I couldn't sleep.
Oh, well...
Why don't you come on in?
I'll make you a bowl of ice cream.
Our family's gonna get bigger now.
Oh, sweetie.
Don't get too attached to the idea
of your Aunt April living in Seattle.
You know how she can be.
That's not it.
You're gonna get married.
I saw it. Not too long from now.
You look the same when it happens.
I'm getting married?
Isn't it great?
You're gonna be so happy.
Okay, well...
Did you happen to see
who the lucky guy was?
Yeah, it was the man
we just met. Ben.
Maia, you saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?
But Ben is with Aunt April.
I guess they don't stay together,
because you two
are gonna get married.
You're gonna have a husband,
I'm gonna have a dad.
Isn't that the best?
Hello? Oh, hey, Tom.
No, we're up.
Have you seen this man?
Sure. I volunteer
at St. Alban's kitchen.
These guys brought the sketch by
when we were closing up tonight.
We bring food down here
twice a week.
- I've seen him.
- Are you sure about that?
Positive.
I remember him because everyone
lets him go to the front of the line.
They get out of his way.
I've never seen that before.
- You haven't seen him today?
- Not for a couple weeks.
But I always see him
eating with Will.
Will's kind of
the elder statesman around here.
He knows just about everyone.
Yeah, I know him. We all do.
- The preacher.
- The preacher?
He never said
his real name was Jordan Collier.
I thought that Collier was dead.
Who are you guys, anyway?
We're from NTAC.
We need to find this man.
- When's the last time you saw him?
- Just now.
- What?
- He's here?
He's always here.
This is pretty empty.
You're sure he's back here?
He never goes anywhere.
Okay.
Say hello to the preacher.
You made a painting of him?
Not me personally,
but the preacher's a popular guy.
He's got some amazing stories.
The guy claims
to have seen the future.
People around here...
...we believe him.
You lied to me, lsabelle.
I don't remember much
about being a baby.
You and Mom mostly. Vague stuff.
I remember Collier.
I remember
how he made you guys feel,
and I remember how I felt
when he touched Mom that time.
Well, you gave him
something to remember that day.
Collier was recovering for months.
That's not the only thing I did to him.
Right before he died
he came to talk to me.
I know it sounds weird.
I was just a baby.
But he wanted me to tell him
whether it was safe to go ahead
- with the party he was planning.
- I remember.
He asked to take you for a walk
through the gardens.
He wanted power.
He wanted acclaim.
A name that would live on
after he died.
So that's what I showed him.
So, what? You gave him a vision?
He had the party. He got shot.
I didn't pull the trigger, but,
Daddy, I made that happen.
If Collier's back,
he knows what I did.
What does he want? Revenge?
We don't even know
whether or not he is alive.
What if he tells Shawn what I did?
You sound
like you're scared of Collier.
Isabelle,
Collier is a very powerful man,
but he is just a man.
He was just a man.
We don't know what he is now.
Guys, I've got something
you need to check out.
You know that graffiti mural?
The one that might be Collier?
Well, there's a national
graffiti database.
- I ran the portrait against it.
- And?
This preacher guy, he gets around.
That one's from Saint Louis.
That's El Paso. Tempe, Arizona.
- Reno.
- These are from all over the country.
If this is Collier,
he's been a very busy man.
Might need a shave and a haircut,
but he's still got charisma.
- He's got followers everywhere.
- So, what?
He's traveling around,
preaching the gospel of the future?
Are you almost done?
I was gonna make you a snack.
- Five more minutes.
- Okay.
Did you see Ben today?
You mean
your Aunt April's boyfriend?
No, I didn't see him,
and I'm not going to see him.
Your antenna is not working right
on this one, sweetie.
Okay.
Hi.
I'm not the type of guy who drops by
unannounced all the time, I promise.
- Okay.
- But I was just in the neighborhood,
I didn't have your phone number.
The pictures we talked about.
Thanks.
Come in.
- Hi, Maia.
- Hi, Ben.
I need to go to my room and study.
You two talk.
So you gonna open it?
Does that look familiar?
That's the Nilgiri Hills.
Yeah.
Listen, this is not gonna happen.
Excuse me?
Married?
Are you sure she meant me?
- Well, that can't happen.
- I'm glad you agree.
April told me about Maia,
what she could do,
- but she's wrong here, right?
- Oh, she's gonna be.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
And no more visits
to bring you pictures.
No more visits, period.
Okay. Well, it was nice meeting you
and then resolving
never to see you again.
- Yeah, nice to meet you too.
- Yeah.
Did you kill me?
It's him.
That's him. That's Jordan Collier.
That's Jordan Collier!
Tell them I didn't kill you!
Tell them you're Jordan Collier!
Tell them! Tell them
you're Jordan Collier! Tell them!
Is that who I am?
When you went to see Kyle,
you signed in as Jeffrey Paulson.
Why?
I found a library card
in the pocket of my coat,
and that's what it said. I thought--
I thought maybe that was my name.
Your name is Jordan Collier.
You don't remember that?
You're one of the 4400.
- Am l?
- You were shot.
You died.
Yes, I saw that in the papers.
I thought I looked like that man.
You disappeared. Do you have
any idea where you've been?
Everywhere.
I have been everywhere.
I've been alive for hundreds of years.
Maybe thousands.
I couldn't speak to anyone.
I just-- I wandered.
No food, no sleep.
And I watched it all.
I watched the world change,
and it just kept getting worse.
And the skies filled with smoke...
...and all the machines
stopped working,
and the streets and the rivers
were filled with bodies.
And the dead were everywhere,
and the Earth cried out
and it never stopped.
The things you're talking about,
they haven't happened.
- Not yet, anyway.
- It's 2006.
It's been less than a year
since you were shot.
How could it be?
I've been wandering for so long.
That's the preliminary DNA report.
That man we're holding
is Jordan Collier.
Well, at least somebody's sure of it.
I need Collier to remember who he is
so he can stand in front of a judge
and ask for my son to be freed.
But, Tom, this is already a win for Kyle.
Collier's alive.
So he serves a term for
attempted murder instead of murder?
No, no, no, Diana.
That's not good enough.
Look, Collier knows who he is.
It's buried in there somewhere.
He showed up at the wedding.
He found his way
to one of his safe houses.
We just need to find a way
to help bring it all to the surface.
Tom, I just got off the phone
with the National Security Advisor.
He wants to schedule
a conference call with him, me
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
to discuss the fact that Jordan Collier
is somehow back from the dead.
And you want me to look the other way
while Alana Mareva, a fugitive,
walks into NTAC
and uses her ability on Collier?
She can access his memories.
Show him his life.
These people in D.C.,
they need Collier to remember
who he is too, right?
They need answers. This might be
the only way to get them.
Nina, please.
We're talking about my son.
You have a way
to get in touch with Alana?
Make the call.
I got it, Maia.
You just couldn't stand
to see me happy, could you?
- April, what are you talking about?
- What did you say to Ben?
- What did you say, Diana?
- Nothing, why?
He broke up with me!
You weren't supposed
to break up with her.
That's not why I told you
what Maia said.
I realize that,
but you have to understand,
a precog just told me
that I was with the wrong person.
And if you know you're with
the wrong person, why stay with them?
I don't know,
maybe because you love them.
I do love April.
At least I thought I did.
You know, I can't believe
how casual you can be with all this.
Maybe it's because
you live with a 4400,
but someone just told me
that I met the person, the woman,
that I'm supposed to be with...
...and I can't ignore it.
And I want you to tell me the truth.
When you look at me,
do you feel anything at all?
An attraction?
An inkling of an attraction?
Yes, I do.
You asked for the truth,
so yes, I do.
And if I met you
under different circumstances,
I'd wanna see you again.
Yeah.
Me too.
- But it doesn't matter, we can't do it.
- Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna take
my sister's stuff and go.
But wouldn't it be something if we were
giving up our shot at happiness?
- Hello, Thomas.
- You cut your hair.
I can't believe you're here.
Thank you for doing this.
For Kyle, I'll do anything,
you know that.
Besides, I've missed you.
Are you ready?
You don't have to do anything.
Just shut your eyes and relax.
You won't feel anything, I promise.
My name's Jordan Collier.
- If I could stay here for a while--
- You're one of the 4400.
That baby could be
the key to the future.
Peter has all the time in the world.
Hi, Peter.
My name's Jordan Collier.
Hello, Richard.
Welcome to the revolution.
Collier, are you all right?
My name is Jordan Collier.
I know why they sent us back.
I saw the catastrophe
and I know what we have to do
to stop it.
You say you have all these answers.
Tell us what they are and then we
can talk about letting you out of here.
You'll learn what I know
when everyone else does.
When will that be?
As soon as I'm free, you and the world
will know what I know.
And what if we hold you indefinitely?
- I've grown accustomed to waiting.
- Yeah, well, I can't.
My son is in prison. You're
the only one who can get him out.
Then you want me released
as badly as I do.
Your son Kyle is innocent.
He is a pawn, and I will say that
to whomever you want
the moment I am a free man.
I can't believe this, Nina.
My son could be one court appearance
away from freedom
and you're refusing to let Collier
testify on his behalf?
I'm not refusing, the Pentagon is.
Their official position is
Collier's not even back.
Come on, Nina. They can't honestly
believe that they can squash this.
Well, they're gonna try.
Look, Collier's return
changes everything.
We're not just talking
about galvanizing the 4400.
There are religious groups
all over the world
who would consider him
the messiah.
No matter what he says,
no matter how crazy it is,
people are going to listen.
So maybe we should find out
what's on his mind
before we stick him
in front of microphones.
What if we don't like
what he has to say?
We stick him in the basement,
pretend this never happened?
I don't think
that's gonna be our decision.
I'd be surprised if Collier's not
transferred out of here by tomorrow.
They should be here by now.
You sure you're okay?
I will be.
When I touched Collier,
those things I saw,
they weren't only from his past.
There were other images too.
Terrible ones.
It was like a nightmare.
I don't know how Collier
lived through it and stayed sane.
I don't wanna leave you, Thomas.
I don't wanna go on the run again.
Well, maybe you don't have to.
What you did today, it helped NTAC.
If I tell them they can have
access to your ability,
maybe they'll drop
the charges against you.
- I'd never hurt the 4400s.
- I know, I know.
Maybe we can work it
so you don't have to, okay?
- Uncle Tom.
- Wait right here.
What the hell's going on?
I didn't help find Jordan
so you could lock him away.
Shawn, they're scared.
This is how the government reacts
when it's scared.
You know, if we wanted
we could take him.
If we set our minds to it,
we can get into NTAC
and there won't be anything
you can do to stop us.
You may be right.
But there might be
another way. Here.
That's a still
from a security camera at NTAC.
It was taken this afternoon.
You show it to everyone.
You let the world know
that Collier's back.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Wagon Wheels.
You know, I used to live
on those things in college.
Ben, what are you doing here?
I eat too.
So, what do you think?
Coincidence,
or is this thing gonna happen
whether we try to stop it or not?
Well, normally, I'd give you a lecture
about free will right now,
but I have to admit,
it might sound a little hollow.
Well, we're both here,
both shopping.
Wanna join forces?
--loved doing the final project.
Let me guess, faces of the elderly?
Red lights.
Every time I'd stop at a red light,
I'd take a picture.
You know, you have to study
these intersections
that you never really noticed.
Like the stores, the people,
the garbage cans, everything.
That's very creative.
- I was just screwing around.
- I would like to see them.
Okay, yeah.
I think I've got them somewhere.
No, wait.
- What?
- We can't do this.
We just did. That was a date,
and that was a pretty good one.
No, it wasn't.
It was nice, but it wasn't a date.
Then why do I feel like doing this?
You gotta admit
that was nice too.
Can I see you again?
Free Collier noW, Free Collier noW,
- Free Collier noW,
- Anyone else feel like it's Bastille Day?
Well, it does feel like
the start of something.
We have gotta let him go.
It's either that or bring in troops.
And we won't just be
reading the riot act to 4400s.
There's clergy out there. Citizens.
Look, we can't just sit on this.
If Collier is some kind of messiah,
he needs to be free.
If he's not,
letting him out is still the right move.
It will give him enough rope
to hang himself.
I'll call D.C.,
but they're gonna wanna know
how those people got their hands
on a picture of Collier.
Any idea what I should tell them?
Yeah, tell them
it's hard to cover up a resurrection.
Free Collier noW,
Free Collier noW, Free Collier noW,
Free Collier now.
Free Collier now. Free Collier now.
Stay back.
It's you. Welcome back, Jordan.
Thank you for keeping
the Center alive while I was gone.
Richard,
glad to see you still with us.
You'll have an important role to play.
I stand here and I see the future:
4400s and non-4400s
working hand in hand
toward a common goal.
Saving humanity is no longer
the exclusive province of the 4400.
Each and every one of you
will have work to do.
And the work starts now.
We're going to the court house.
There is an innocent man
who needs to be freed.
Look, just get those people
away from this building.
You're impeding
the business of my court.
They won't leave until you listen
to what I have to say.
I hereby withdraw
any and all charges
against Kyle Baldwin
for my alleged murder.
Well, Mr. Baldwin
still assaulted two federal agents.
Now, he fired a high-powered weapon
into a crowd of people,
and he admitted it all
in a detailed confession.
My son has been in jail for months.
He's a first-time offender.
You could release him
with time served.
Those people out there,
they listen to me.
They will be back every day
until this man's son goes free.
Well, these are
highly unusual circumstances,
I'll grant you both that.
Perhaps we can revisit
the murder plea.
Do. Quickly.
Thank you.
- Thought you didn't wanna see me.
- I don't. I wanna see your pictures.
Well, okay. So I knew you'd be here.
Then why did you come?
I guess I've been thinking
about the grocery store,
and I thought
it was a good date too.
It just didn't end right.
Okay.
Then how should it have ended?
Hi, Mommy.
- Hi.
- Where you been, Di?
Nowhere, I just had to work late.
I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't apologize.
Those things you saw in me--
Pride, ambition, vanity.
--they were there.
I had to die to lose them.
I've done bad things
and I'm supposed to do more.
I know.
And I'm trying not to.
Tell me what to do. I'll do anything.
Leave.
Leave the 4400 Center
and never come back.
Nothing you can do will change
what you are, lsabelle.
You are the enemy of the 4400.
The enemy of everything that is good.
And that part of you that is human...
...it is much smaller
than the part of you that's not,
and your struggle
to keep it alive will fail.
No, no.
- I have a choice.
- Others might, not you.
If that's true, if we're enemies, then
why shouldn't I just kill you right now?
You're welcome to try,
but it won't work.
I'm ready for you this time.
This place is mine again...
...and you're not welcome here.
Goodbye, lsabelle.
Durant les 60 dernières années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées.
Toutes sont revenues en même temps.
Sans aucun souvenir d'où elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des nouvelles capacités.
Toutes essayent de reprendre...
...une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans Les 4400...
Sais-tu qui je suis ?
Dès que je suis libre,
vous et le reste du monde saurez tout
ce que je sais.
Mon fils est en prison.
Vous êtes le seul à pouvoir l'en sortir.
Est-ce que tu m'as...
tué ?
C'est Jordan Collier !
Dites-leur que je ne vous ai pas tué !
Tu vas te marier.
Je l'ai vu.
As-tu réussi à voir qui était
l'heureux élu ?
Quelqu'un vient de me dire que j'ai
rencontré ma future femme,
et je ne peux pas ignorer ça.
Il a rompu avec moi !
J'ai fait de mauvaises choses.
Tu es l'ennemi.
Dites-moi ce que je dois faire.
Je ferai n'importe quoi.
Quitte le centre et ne revient jamais.
Ils ne pourront pas se cacher
longtemps.
Dr Burkhoff ne passe pas
tout à fait inaperçu.
Nous sommes fiers d'annoncer l'existence
de ce programme de soldats améliorés.
A terme,
ils seront les premiers non-4400
à développer des capacités surhumaines
afin de défendre les Etats-Unis.
Vous avez une source de promicine
pour votre programme.
Qui est-ce ?
Ces choses se passent bien
au-dessus de ma position.
Les soldats que vous créez,
allez-vous réellement les utiliser
pour défendre le pays,
où allez-vous seulement les envoyer
combattre les 4400 ?
Il y a une différence ?
Monsieur Collier, nous vous voyons beaucoup
dans les journaux depuis votre...
Résurrection ?
Je suppose que c'est ainsi que
beaucoup l'appelle.
Et dans chaque interview,
vous n'avez cessé de répéter
la même déclaration...
"La guerre pour le futur aura lieu
dans le passé."
Exactement...
et par "passé",
entendez-vous maintenant ?
Aujourd'hui ?
C'est notre fardeau à tous, oui.
Et cette guerre,
oppose-t-elle les 4400 aux non-4400 ?
Non.
C'est une guerre entre le bien et le mal,
et elle a déjà commencé.
Le côté du bien,
4400 et non-4400...
Allez, Kyle. Le dîner est servi.
- ont déjà...
- J'arrive tout de suite.
fait d'incroyables sacrifices,
et ont sait que d'autres sacrifices vont
être nécessaires.
Ils sont les premiers à savoir
ce que coûte ce combat,
parce que,
en mieux ou en moins bien,
nos vies sont différentes maintenant,
profondément différentes.
C'est le lot de toute guerre.
Elle nous change.
Mais les enjeux...
ce qui est en jeu n'est ni plus ni moins
que l'avenir de l'humanité.
Mais pourquoi faut-il que cette
guerre ait lieu ?
J'ai vu le futur,
c'est un futur sans espoir.
La race humaine y est usée,
malade, mourante.
Les restes de la civilisation sont contrôlés
par une élite brutale et puissante
qui s'est retranchée au sein de la
dernière cité du monde
tandis que le reste de l'humanité
se bat pour survivre
dans le désert poussiéreux environnant.
Cela semble plutôt sans espoir.
N'est-ce pas ?
Mais il y a un espoir,
il y a toujours un espoir,
et il repose en nous.
Nous pouvons changer le futur
mais nous devons nous y atteler
dès maintenant. Aujourd'hui.
Tout ce qui est crucial à la survie
du monde, sa prospérité...
Les ressources de cette planète,
la nourriture, l'eau, l'énergie,
les constituants même de la vie..
Sont, à l'instant où je parle,
monopolisés et contrôlés par un
petit groupe isolé et puissant.
Cela ne doit plus être.
Nous devons arrêter ça.
Nous ennemis sont forts,
et se renforcent chaque jour un peu plus,
et ne reculeront devant rien
pour préserver leur domination,
pour nous garder sur le chemin actuel,
un chemin menant uniquement
au désastre,
uniquement à la catastrophe à venir
qui nous attend.
Nous devons nous rassembler
pour le combattre...
Ce mal dans nos rangs,
un mal qui pourrait tous nous détruire.
C'est notre seule chance.
Ecoutez, je vous le dis,
je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé, ok ?
Je m'occupais des bulletins de nuit
avec Havemeyer,
et d'un coup,
je me suis retrouvé avec de la bave sur ma
chemise et Havemeyer ronflant à mes côtés.
Donc, vous me dites que vous avez
passé la nuit entière à dormir ?
Endormi, évanoui...
Je ne me souviens pas.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
Bonne question.
J'ai un bâtiment entier plein d'agents
qui ne se souviennent pas de la moindre chose.
Pendant qu'ils roupillaient,
tous les membres du groupe Nova que le NTAC
avait arrêté se sont échappés tranquillement.
Oui, en marchant, en courant, en volant...
Impossible de savoir puisqu'ils ont effacé
les bandes de sécurité en sortant.
Mais tous les 4400 en bas étaient forcés
de prendre l'inhibiteur de promicine
donc aucun d'eux n'a pu utiliser sa
capacité pour s'échapper.
Ils ont dû se faire aider.
Quelqu'un de l'extérieur.
Un 4400.
Non, plus d'un.
Un pour assommer tous nos agents,
un autre pour désactiver le
système de sécurité.
Donc, il s'agirait de sympathisants ou
de membres encore jamais capturés ?
Quoiqu'il en soit, il semble que quelqu'un
soit en train de reformer le groupe Nova.
Paul Newbold a la capacité d'augmenter
ou de baisser la température corporelle.
Tina Richardson.
Elle efface les mémoires.
Elle peut te faire oublier ce que tu as
mangé au petit-déjeuner
ou encore effacer ta vie entière.
Ensuite il y a mon vieux pote, Boyd Gelder,
qui peut te retirer ta vie entière.
Le transformiste parfait.
Chacun d'eux est capable de causer
de sérieux dégâts.
Ils l'ont déjà prouvé.
Et comme apparemment quelqu'un
les a fait s'évader,
ils pourraient bien récidiver.
Le groupe Nova a pas mal de compte à régler...
à commencer par ton neveu.
J'ai appelé Shawn.
Le centre des 4400 est déjà une
forteresse,
mais je vais m'assurer qu'ils
augmentent le niveau de sécurité.
Dennis Ryland doit faire partie aussi
de la tête de leur liste.
Alana et Kyle aussi.
Boyd s'en est pris à ma famille par le passé.
Allez-y.
Je vais envoyer des agents surveiller
votre maison.
Agent Baldwin,
pourquoi votre fils ne veut-il pas
faire de déclaration ?
Quelqu'un l'a-t-il payé pour tiré
sur Jordan Collier ?
A-t-il toujours su que Collier était vivant ?
Combien de temps va-t-on devoir rester terrés ici ?
Quelques jours, deux mois ?
Heureusement pas trop longtemps.
Nous avons arrêté Boyd Gelder une fois.
Nous le ferons à nouveau.
En attendant, Kyle,
tu ne dois pas t'éloigner de la maison.
Ne vas nulle part à moins d'un cas
d'absolue nécessité.
Ca pourrait être pire.
Après tout, tu pourrais encore
être en prison.
Je pourrais encore être en fuite.
Comparé à ça,
rester à la maison n'est pas si mal...
Et en un rien de temps,
tu seras de retour à l'école.
Elle a raison, Kyle.
Tu as regardé les formulaires d'inscription
que je t'ai laissés ?
Si tu veux, je peux...
Tu sais, je peux parler au bureau
des admissions.
Je ne suis pas sûr d'être prêt à
retourner à l'école.
Si tu veux attendre un semestre,
ça ne tient qu'à toi,
mais je me suis dit que, tu sais,
retourner à l'école t'aiderait à
retrouver une vie normale.
Papa, tu as bien regardé là-dehors ?
Ca n'arrivera pas.
Kyle, tu dois juste...
Tu dois juste être patient.
Papa, je sais que tu essaies de m'aider,
mais Jordan Collier est revenu
d'entre les morts.
Personne ne va oublier ça.
Et aussi longtemps qu'on
se souviendra de Jordan Collier,
on se souviendra du gars qui l'a
assassiné.
J'ai averti Nina Jarvis.
Je lui ai dit que le NTAC n'était pas du tout
préparé au genre de menaces annoncées.
M'a-t-elle écoutée ?
Non...
Et voilà le résultat.
Le NTAC est littéralement endormi
sur ses bureaux
pendant que les 4400 les plus dangereux
prennent la fuite.
Nous parlons du groupe Nova.
Des terroristes violents.
Il n'est pas question des 4400 ici.
Tom,
je suis sûr que tu comprendras que
cette distinction n'a plus aucun sens.
Chaque 4400 a développé une capacité.
Ce qui veut dire que chaque 4400
est un ennemi potentiel.
Ma fille est à l'école primaire.
Elle n'est l'ennemie de personne.
Les enfants grandissent, Diana.
Dennis,
nous ne savons pas ce que prépare
le groupe Nova.
Mais ils s’en sont déjà pris à toi par le passé.
Le NTAC est prêt à t'offrir toute la
protection dont tu pourrais avoir besoin.
C'est très généreux, Tom,
mais si ma mémoire est bonne,
le groupe Nova a tenté par deux fois de me tuer
alors que j'étais sous la protection du NTAC.
Deux fois infructueuses.
Ne paraît pas si déçu.
Pouvez-vous venir dans un instant,
s'il vous plaît ?
Cette fois-ci, je vais assurer moi-même
ma sécurité.
Bonjour.
Nous discutions à l'instant de la dernière menace
lancée par le groupe Nova.
Il n'y a aucune menace.
Pas tant que je suis dans les parages,
tout du moins.
Ton oncle,
il les a vraiment vu ensemble ?
Ma fille et Ryland ?
Au moins, on sait maintenant où elle était
la semaine dernière.
Jordan aurait dû nous parler
avant de la forcer à partir.
C'est comme s'il l'avait livrée à Ryland.
Je n'en sais rien.
Si elle est la source de la promicine de Ryland,
cela veut dire qu'elle travaillait avec lui
bien avant de quitter le centre.
Peut-être que l'un d'entre nous pourrait
lui parler.
S'assurer qu'elle sait dans quoi
elle est embarquée.
Une fois que ma fille a décidé une chose,
aucun moyen de l'en dissuader.
Tu le sais bien.
Je suis désolé, Richard.
Toute sa vie,
j'ai essayé de trouver du bon en Isabelle,
une sorte de lumière,
quelque chose à développer.
Peut-être que je perdais mon temps...
car il n'y a jamais rien eu de bon en elle.
Salut. Je suis rentré.
Je n'ai pas pu passer au supermarché.
J'ai pensé qu'on pourrait...
Commander une pizza.
Ne t'en fais pas pour moi.
J'ai déjà mangé.
Je vois ça.
Pourquoi ne me rappelle-t-il pas ?
Qui ?
Ben ?
Je lui ai laissé 5 messages.
Je veux juste qu'il sache que
je lui pardonne, tu sais ?
C'est probablement de ma faute.
Je l'ai sûrement fait fuir.
Rester assise là à te morfondre
n'aide en rien.
Tu crois qu'il voit quelqu'un d'autre ?
Tu dois te lever.
prend une douche,
change de vêtements,
et allons au restaurant.
Mais s'il appelle ?
Réponds à mon portable, ok ?
Bien sûr.
Et s'il appelle,
soit gentille avec lui,
parce que lorsque nous nous remettrons
ensemble,
je ne veux pas qu'il y ait de tensions entre
vous deux.
Salut, chérie.
Nous étions d'accord.
Pas de jeux vidéo avant manger.
Maia...
J'avais besoin de m'échapper un peu.
De quoi ?
De tante April.
Je suis désolée, mon coeur.
Elle n'a pas arrêté depuis le moment
où je suis rentrée de l'école.
Elle n'arrête pas de me demander
s'ils vont se remettre ensemble.
Il va falloir que tu ménages ta tante April.
Elle traverse une période très dure.
Mais toi et Ben,
vous êtes sensés être ensemble.
Peut-être que si tu lui racontes
ce que j'ai vu...
Je ne pense pas que cela va l'aider
quelque part à aller mieux.
Il va bien finir par apprendre pour vous deux
de toutes façons.
Je veux dire...
vous allez l'inviter à votre mariage.
Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ?
C'est assez remarquable.
Je suis impressionné.
Jordan.
On vous dérange ?
Non, non pas du tout.
Tout va bien ?
Pas vraiment.
Nous venons de parler à oncle Tommy.
Il nous a dit que...
Isabelle et Dennis Ryland travaillent ensemble.
Je vois.
Jordan...
tu as entendu ce que je viens de te dire ?
Renvoyer Isabelle d'ici n'était
pas la meilleure décision.
Lorsqu'Isabelle était là,
c'était une menace.
Son alliance avec Dennis Ryland clarifie
simplement envers qui va sa loyauté,
et la clarté est une bonne chose, non ?
Mais nous devons encore...
accroître la sécurité ici,
juste pour être sûr.
Il ne s'agit pas seulement d'Isabelle et
de Ryland dehors.
Nous devons aussi nous préoccuper
du groupe Nova.
Le groupe Nova n'est plus notre ennemi.
N'est-ce pas vrai ?
Nous n'avons aucun problème avec vous.
Du moins, plus maintenant.
Shawn,
Richard...
vous connaissez Boyd Gelder ?
Comme vous pouvez le constater,
c'est une sorte d'imitateur.
Qu'est-ce qu'un membre du groupe Nova
fait ici ?
C'est un 4400, Shawn.
Où d'autre devrait-il être ?
Du reste,
Je me suis donné un grand mal à le faire
sortir lui et ses amis du NTAC.
Jordan, c'est insensé.
J'ai mis ma vie en danger pour protéger cet
endroit du groupe Nova,
et maintenant c'est nous qui les libérons
du NTAC ?
A quoi pensais-tu ?
Que nous avons une guerre a mené.
Ce groupe Nova est une arme puissante,
à qui, jusqu'à maintenant, manquait
un guide adéquat.
Jordan, ce sont des terroristes.
Ils tuent des gens.
Ils font ce qu'ils doivent faire.
Ils privilégient l'action aux accommodations.
Ne pas avoir appuyer ce choix
était une erreur, Shaw.
Oh, alors j'ai fait une erreur en n'aidant
pas le groupe Nova ?
Je dis que tu aurais dû agir
comme un leader.
Ces gens sont prêts à tous les sacrifices
pour une cause supérieure.
Ils sont le genre de soldats qu'il nous faut
dans ce combat.
Jordan,
ils sont l'une des principales raisons
pour lesquelles les gens ont peur de nous,
donc si nous les accueillons ici,
alors nous devenons nous-mêmes membres
du groupe Nova,
et tout ce que tu prêches depuis ton retour,
sur une coopération et une unité entre
4400 et non-4400,
tout ça n'aura jamais lieu.
Richard ?
Nous prenons un gros risque là, Jordan.
L'enjeu est énorme.
Si le NTAC découvre que nous sommes
impliqués dans la libération des prisonniers,
ce sera très mauvais.
Tu es sûr d'assurer tes arrières ici ?
Ils sont bien à l’abri ?
Avec les 4400 qui les ont aidé à s'échapper.
Personne ne les trouvera.
Non, non, non, non.
Le fait qu'on ne va pas se faire prendre
ne signifie pas que tout va bien.
Richard,
non, dis-moi que tu ne cautionnes pas ça.
Je suis juste réaliste.
Le fait est que
nous n'avons jamais été aussi vulnérables.
Isabelle est avec Ryland maintenant.
Ce n'est juste qu'une question de temps
avant que ses soldats ne soient prêts à
développer des capacités.
Jordan a raison.
Il y a beaucoup trop en jeu, maintenant.
Un mois de plus ?
C'est totalement inacceptable.
Les volontaires initiaux développaient
des capacités en quelques jours.
C'est vrai, mais je vous rappelle,
qu'il y a eu des problèmes.
Des morts.
Depuis l'incident de Piersal,
Nous avons ralenti la cadence pour les
injections de promicine.
Je ne l'ai jamais autorisé.
J'ai garanti à ce pays une protection
des soldats améliorés.
Je ne ferai pas de moi un
menteur par votre faute.
Augmentez les doses.
Je recevrai un autre chargement de promicine
de la HaspelCorp, aujourd'hui.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi vous perdez
votre temps à créer une armée.
Vous n'en avez pas besoin.
Vous êtes une jeune femme
très puissante, Isabelle,
mais vous n'êtes encore qu'une personne.
Prenez-le comme du renfort.
Si ça peut vous rassurer...
Mais pour le moment, Collier sait que
nous travaillons ensemble.
Il n'attendra pas un mois pour nous poursuivre.
Si nous donnons à ces soldats
la dose maximale de promicine,
Combien de temps avant qu'ils ne
développent des capacités ?
Peut-être deux à trois jours.
Je vous en donne deux.
Pourquoi attendre ?
Vous avez entendu la demoiselle.
Je vais rester ici à la base pour
surveiller vos progrès.
Kyle.
Le voilà.
Regarde-toi, mec.
Tu es resplendissant.
Je n'arrive pas à croire
que tu sois là.
Il faut fêter ça.
Nous devons faire quelque chose.
Ouais, ça a l'air tentant.
D'abord, je voudrais
te demander un service.
Dis-moi.
Ca fait plaisir de te voir, Kyle.
J'avais espéré pouvoir parler avec toi.
C'est vraiment vous, n'est-ce pas ?
Vous êtes vivant.
Ca m'a pris un moment avant
que j'y crois moi-même.
Je suis désolé...
pour ce que je vous ai fait.
Il n'y a pas de quoi s'excuser.
Je devais mourir.
Je vous ai vu à la télévision.
Vous semblez si certain que tout ce
qu'on a traversé signifiait quelque chose.
J'aurais aimé pouvoir comprendre comme vous.
Pour moi, tout ceci semble
une perte de temps.
Ma mort faisait partie de notre plan.
Je sais que tu as souffert,
et ce n'était pas juste.
Mais tout ce tu as accompli, Kyle,
y compris mon assassinat,
Tout cela faisait partie du plan.
Tu ignores complètement à
quel point tu es important.
Dis-moi qu'on va passer
toute la nuit ensemble.
Tu sais, je crois que Maia devrait être
présente quand je vais lui dire.
De cette façon, au moins elle pourra lui expliquer
toute l'histoire de la prédiction.
Tant de souvenirs...
Pitié, dis-moi que tu ne pensais pas
à April juste avant.
Non.
Pas du tout.
Tu as raison.
On devrait lui dire.
Je devrais lui dire.
Elle devrait le savoir par moi.
Ce serait comme si je me cachais
derrière toi, et...
Je l'admets, ça a l'air
normal maintenant, mais...
Je me haïrais encore plus.
J'aurais souhaité savoir quoi dire.
Dis-lui la vérité.
Tu vois ?
On n'a pas prévu ça.
On ne le voulait même pas...
mais c'est arrivé.
Nous sommes tombés amoureux.
Ce n'est pas un peu trop tôt
pour utiliser ce mot ?
Comment tu voudrais appeler ça ?
Mon Dieu.
C'est vrai.
Deux semaines, et je suis amoureuse.
C'est une bonne chose.
Je le sais bien.
Enfin, normalement, mais...
Je suis amoureuse et je ne peux pas
être contente.
Mais qu'est-ce que ça peut
paraître pitoyable.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
J'avais un peu de temps devant moi.
J'ai pensé que quelqu'un pourrait
en profiter.
Pas toi.
Kyle.
Je fais des Penne Arrabiata.
Je te parie qu’il n’en a pas mangé
depuis un bout de temps.
Où est Kyle ?
Il sera de retour dans une minute.
Il est sorti ?
Après que je lui en ai interdit ?
Il est parti à NorthMount.
Il voulait s'inscrire à des cours.
C'est super.
Comment il a passé les journalistes ?
Ils ne savent même pas qu'il est parti.
J'ai fait un panier avec du thé glacé
et des sandwiches,
et je leur ai apporté,
Et je les ai distrait pendant que
Kyle filait en douce par derrière.
On a tout mis au point ensemble.
C'était amusant.
Je suis contente que quelqu'un ait
passé une bonne journée.
Je suppose que ta journée de
travail s'est mal passée ?
Non.
Nous avons parlé à toutes les familles de
chaque prisonniers évadés.
Personne n'a rien vu rien entendu.
Enfin, pas qu'ils abandonneraient
leur bien-aimé aussi facilement...
Et il y a toujours ce 4400 qui
les a fait sortir.
Excuse-moi, chérie.
On n'a pas non plus beaucoup
avancé avec ça.
Kyle va être très content.
Tu crois qu'on aurait entendu
parlé d'un 4400
qui peut court-circuiter un système
de sécurité moderne,
ou couper l'arrivée d'oxygène d'un
bâtiment rempli de personne.
J'avais un élève au centre, il...
Quand il est venu à l'école au début,
il a eu des problèmes.
Les professeurs et les autres enfants
avaient des migraines,
ou s'évanouissaient quand
il s'approchait d'eux.
Il s'est avéré que c'était
à cause de son habilité :
Changer le niveau d'oxygène
dans le sang.
Alana, cet élève, comment
il s'appelle ?
Michael Lawrence?
Vous pensez qu'il a un rapport
avec l'évasion de prison ?
Il n'a que 16 ans.
Son habilité correspond avec ce
qui est arrivé à nos agents.
Et Boyd Gelder n'est pas
beaucoup plus âgé.
Nous avons parlé au père de Michael.
Il dit ne pas avoir vu son fils
de toute la semaine.
Shawn, n'est-il pas possible
qu'une nouvelle cellule
du Groupe Nova soit en activité
à l'extérieur du centre ?
Si c'était le cas,
tu ne crois pas qu'il serait déjà
après moi à l'heure qu'il est ?
Peut-être bien.
On ne sait pas ce qu'ils manigancent.
Tu permets qu'on parle à des élèves,
voir ce qu’ils peuvent nous
dire au sujet de Michael ?
Parlez à qui vous voulez.
Ecoute, Shawn...
J'apprécie ce que tu fais.
Tu sais, ça aide beaucoup d'avoir
quelqu'un ici sur qui on peut compter.
J'espère que ça ne change rien
maintenant que Collier est de retour.
Très bien.
L'habilité de Michael Lawrence
est unique, utile,
et il la contrôle avec énormément d'assurance.
Pourquoi je ne l'utiliserais pas ?
Parce que c'est un gosse de 16 ans
que tu as transformé en criminel.
Shawn, ce garçon nous a permis
de neutraliser un bâtiment remplis d'agents
du NTAC sans faire de mal à personne.
Je pense que j'ai montré de bonne contrainte,
vu l'urgence de nos besoins.
Quels besoins, Jordan ?
Qu'est-ce qui est si important qui nous oblige à
travailler avec le Groupe Nova ?
Allez.
J'ai fait tourner cet endroit
pendant ton absence.
Je crois que je mérite de savoir
ce que vous manigancer.
Le programme d'amélioration des soldats.
Nous allons le détruire.
Le Détruire comment ?
Avec l'aide du Groupe Nova,
nous allons attaquer la base militaire
où se déroule l'expérience.
Détruire le labo, le programme d'entraînement,
et quand nous aurons trouvé les soldats
qui prennent la promicine...
Nous les neutraliserons.
Attaquer une base militaire ?
Jordan, es-tu malade ?
C'est ce à quoi tu ressembles en ce moment.
Je me fous de ce que tu penses
avoir vu quand tu es mort.
C'est le monde réel.
Jordan, écoute-moi.
Sais-tu combien de gens mourraient ?
Des deux côtés.
Nous n'avons pas le choix.
Une fois que ces soldats auront
développé des capacités de 4400...
Il sera trop tard.
Il y a une station essence.
C'est le long d'une route.
Près de là, il y a un panneau
d'indication.
Vous pouvez lire le panneau ?
J'essaye.
Quelque chose à propos de la
souche d'un arbre pétrifié.
C'est le plus grand de cet Etat.
Je crains que ce soit tout.
C'est le problème avec ces visions à distance...
Je ne vois jamais tout.
Ca doit suffir pour les trouver.
L'essence...
et un quart d'huile, ce qui fait...
un total de 53.
Ok.
J'espère que vous prendrez le temps
et que vous visiterez ce qui fait
la gloire de Newfield.
Il n'y a pas souche pareille
sur toute la côte ouest.
Nous ne ferons qu'y passer.
Si je...
si je reviens sur mes pas,
je trouverai l'autoroute ?
Oh, elle peut vous renseigner.
Il veut retourner directement
sur l'autoroute.
C'est facile...
mais d'abord,
je pense que vous devriez
voir la souche de Newfield.
Il y a une chouette boutique de souvenir.
La ville pourrait vous plaire.
Je suis juste le panneau ?
Exact,
et il y a un resto sympa
sur la route.
Toutes les tourtes sont
fraîchement cuites.
Ca semble bien.
Nous allons voir ça.
Merci.
Vous ne serez pas déçus.
Ces tartes arrivent sur un camion.
Ils ont besoin de clients.
Docteur Burkhoff.
Melle Dorner.
Je suis Jordan Collier.
Je parie que ce n'est
pas une coïncidence.
Où en sont vos recherches ?
Ca occupe mes nuits.
Monsieur Collier...
Nous nous sommes fait une vie agréable.
C'est un bon endroit pour nous,
et nous aimons croire que nous rendons
certaines choses meilleures en restant là.
Ne gâchez pas ça.
Si ça ne tenait qu'à moi, vous vivriez
heureux ici de nombreuses années
mais pour le moment,
j'ai besoin de votre talent et
de votre intelligence.
Salut ma puce,
Je pense que c'est fromage grillé le mercredi.
Où est ta tante April ?
Ne sois pas en colère.
Pourquoi serais-je en colère ?
Tu n'as pas...
Je pensais qu'elle se sentirait mieux,
en étant au courant pour mes visions.
ce n'est pas de sa faute si Ben te préfère.
Et s'est-elle sentie mieux ?
Pas vraiment.
Elle est dans ta chambre.
April ?
Par ici.
Tu es en rade de mouchoirs.
Il y en a d'autres sous le lavabo.
Tu sais...
Une des premières raisons qui font
que j'ai apprécié Ben
c'est que je me suis dit,
"Voilà un gars"
que ma soeur apprécierait...
enfin.
Eh bien...tu avais raison.
C'était ça.
Ma seule chance de m'installer
avec le bon mec...
sauf qu'il s'avère que c'est TON bon mec.
Mon dieu, April...
Toute cette histoire avec Ben...
je veux dire, on n'a jamais voulu que ça arrive.
Je...
Je sais que ça n'aide pas beaucoup.
Je sais que je rencontrerai d'autres gars...
comme d'habitude.
Les rencontrer,
dormir avec eux,
aller à une soirée fétichiste avec eux...
ce n'est pas le problème.
En trouver un qui accepte d'aller à ces
soirées fétichistes avec moi année après année...
c'est ça le problème.
Ben voulait aller au bal fétichiste avec toi ?
Il y réfléchissait.
Ecoute, Di...
J'aurais voulu pouvoir te détester,
vraiment,
mais je suis trop occupée à me détester.
Je suis une telle perdante.
Non...
non, tu ne l'es pas.
Si, je le suis.
Je vais vivre seule
et je vais mourir seule,
et tout ce que je serai
pour quelqu'un c'est
"tante April, la perdante."
Kyle, tu as une seconde ?
Oui, je me débarrassais juste
de quelques vieilleries.
Allez, papa.
J'avais neuf ans quand j'ai eu ça.
Ouais, je me souviens de ce jour.
Ecoute, Kyle...
une fois que tu reprendras l'école,
j'ai pensé que je pourrai
te donner un peu d'argent.
Comme ça, tu pourras avoir
ton chez-toi
et donc avoir un peu de vie
privée, de l'indépendance.
J'ai vu Jordan Collier hier.
Tu es allé au Centre ?
Pourquoi ?
Je devais le voir.
Nous avons parlé.
Il m'a aidé à me rendre compte
de certaines choses.
Lesquelles ?
Je ne vais pas retourner à la fac, déjà.
Papa, écoute-moi.
Ecoute-moi bien.
Ma vie, mon avenir,
c'est lié de près aux 4400.
Cette nuit-là, sur la plage,
quand Shawn a été enlevé,
ça aurait dû être moi.
S'il ne m'avait pas poussé hors de
ce rayon de lumière
J'aurais été un d'entre eux.
Oui, mais ce n'est pas le cas.
Kyle, ta vie peut être ce que
tu veux qu'elle soit.
Il te suffit de vouloir aller de l'avant.
Depuis que je me suis réveillé de ce coma,
je croyais aller de l'avant,
mais Jordan m'a aidé à réaliser que
tout ce que je faisais, c'était fuir.
Il t'a dit ça ?
Il t'a dit de ne pas aller à la fac ?
Non, papa, il m'a seulement écouté.
Je l'ai compris par moi-même.
Alors, que vas-tu faire maintenant, Kyle ?
Mettre un blazer bleu,
devenir l'un de ses disciples ?
Faire visiter le Centre,
répondre au téléphone ?
Peut-être.
Je vais faire comme toi, papa.
Je vais aider les 4400 de la
façon que je pourrai.
Je suis désolé.
Je suis d'accord avec Jordan
sur ce point, Shawn.
Comment peux-tu dire ça ?
Si nous attaquons cette base militaire,
c'est comme déclarer la guerre au
gouvernement Américain.
Peut-être,
mais il me semble nous sommes dans une guerre
non déclarée avec le gouvernement
depuis notre retour.
Nous garder en quarantaine.
Nous droguer avec l'inhibiteur.
Faire disparaître ceux d'entre nous qui
leur...leur paraissaient menaçants.
Tout ce que fait Jordan c'est d'amener
ce conflit au grand jour.
Jordan va sacrifier des milliers de vies.
Et tout ça pour rien.
Nous allons perdre.
Si tu as un autre moyen,
quelque chose de concret pour nous
mettre plus à l'abri...
J'aimerais l'entendre.
Mon Dieu...
C'est ce que je pensais.
Ok, peux-tu nous donner un indice
sur ce dont il s'agit ?
Tu disais que c'était urgent.
Les membres de Nova qui se sont échappés...
je sais ce qu'il prépare...
et qui est leur chef.
Ok.
Shawn...
Il me faut un nom.
Jordan collier.
Vous devez penser que je suis fou.
Seul un psychopathe déclarerait
une guerre à l'armée Américaine.
alors nous sommes tous d'accord.
Je vous l'assure,
je ne suis pas fou.
Je ne projette aucune attaque contre une
installation gouvernementale.
Alors vous dites que Shawn a imaginé
tout cela ?
Pourquoi ferais-je ça ?
Jordan...
dis la vérité, d'accord ?
Tu ne peux pas cacher ça.
Je t'ai raconté des histoires, Shawn,
pour voir si tu le ferais savoir.
C'était un test...
et je crains que tu aies échoué.
Je ne prévois pas d'attaquer
un bâtiment du gouvernement.
Alors vous dites que Shawn a inventé
tout ça ?
Pourquoi ferais-je ça ?
Jordan...
Dites simplement la vérité, ok ?
Vous ne pouvez pas couvrir ça.
Je t'ai raconté une histoire, Shawn,
pour voir comment tu allais réagir.
C'était un test...
et j'ai bien peur que tu aies échoué.
J'ai été loin de cet endroit
pendant longtemps.
Durant les prochains jours,
Je vais en demander beaucoup
à chacun d'entre vous.
J'ai besoin de savoir en qui
je peux avoir confiance...
ou non.
Je suis désolé de t'avoir
embarrasser comme ça Shawn.
C'était le seul moyen d'être sûr.
Et en ce qui concerne l'évasion au NTAC,
vous n'avez rien à voir là-dedans non plus ?
Non.
C'est un mensonge.
C'est un mensonge.
J'ai vu de mes yeux Boyd Gelder
debout dans ce bureau.
Richard était avec moi.
Il l'a vu aussi.
Richard ?
Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles, Shawn.
Richard...
Pour autant que je sache,
Boyd Gelder n'a jamais été ici.
Donc, vous dites,
qu'en dépit de tout les
démentis de Collier,
cette base est toujours la
cible potentielle du Group Nova ?
C'est possible, oui.
Et vous avez fait tout ce chemin
pour m'avertir ?
Je suis touché, Tom.
Je fais mon boulot, Dennis.
Ca n'a rien de personnel.
Collier sait que vous êtes ici,
donc cet endroit n'est plus
sûr à présent.
Notre petite expérience a besoin
d'une nouvelle maison.
Laissez-les venir.
Si Collier veut un combat,
Nous lui en donnerons un.
Elle a raison vous savez.
Collier parle d'un bon jeu...
l'unité, combattant ensemble
pour sauver le futur...
les gens croient qu'il parle d'eux.
C'est pathétique.
Mais une attaque exposerait les 4400
à ce qu'ils sont vraiment.
les ennemis.
Tu vois, Tom ? J'avais raison
sur toute la ligne.
Tout se réduit à la survie.
Nous contre eux.
Es-tu sûr de vouloir être à l'origine
de ça, Dennis ?
Défendant la race humaine ?
Qui d'autre pourrait le faire ?
Nous restons ici.
Ca t'a fait quoi,
de te retourner contre moi ?
J'essayais juste de sauver des vies.
La tienne également.
Tu sais, peut-être que si
tu m'avais tout dit,
me traitant avec un peu de respect,
Nous aurions pu améliorer les choses,
mais non,
tu étais trop occupé à me manipuler,
comme toujours.
Tu sais, Jordan, quand tu étais parti...
Je me suis occupé de cet endroit,
et j'ai fait du bon boulot, moi aussi.
Maintenant tu es revenu.
Toi et moi,
c'est comme si rien n'avait changé.
Tu prends toutes les décisions,
et je dois me contenter de suivre.
Cinq pas derrière.
Avant c'était 10 pas.
Shawn...
J'ai besoin que tu crois en moi.
Tu veux savoir ce que je pense, Jordan ?
Je crois que toute cette histoire de messie
est sortie de ta tête.
Je ne suis pas le messie.
Plus comme...
John Brown.
John Brown ?
Le gars qui a essayé de libérer tous
les esclaves ?
Il s'était entouré de gens qui croyaient,
comme lui,
Et ils étaient prêts à tout pour
cette cause,
et cette sorte de dévotion
peut changer le monde.
Ils ont tué John Brown, Jordan.
Ils m'ont tué également.
Mr Ryland.
On m'a dit qu'on ne vous avez
pas vu ici depuis un moment.
Nous sommes en état d'alerte.
Les services du NTAC nous ont
envoyé un mot disant que
Jordan Collier pourrait planifier
une attaque contre nous.
Je veux que vous transfériez toute la
promicine de Haspelcorp vers un endroit sûr.
Je veux que tout les paquets soient prêts pour
le transfert le plus tôt possible.
Oui, monsieur.
Donnez-nous un coup de main.
Nous avons beaucoup de caisses à bouger.
Je veux qu'elles soient chargées dès que possible.
Nous le prendrons d'ici.
La base militaire n'a jamais
été la cible de Collier.
Il voulait nous distraire de son but réel.
La promicine.
Vous en avez assez entreposé ici pour
créer toute une armée de soldats.
Avant que Collier le fasse,
vous auriez voulu cette
armée pour vous protéger.
J'aimerais savoir ce qu'il va faire avec.
La détruire.
Il veut que personne d'autre ne développe de
capacités.
Il veut nous garder faible,
dès lors personne ne pourra riposter.
Ca semble un peu paranoïaque, Dennis.
Collier est un fanatique, Tom.
Il est capable de tout.
Vous verrez.
Alors tu dis que tu veux rompre ?
Je ne veux pas.
Alors on ne rompt pas.
Ecoute, je sais comme tu te sens mal...
Je me sens mal aussi...
mais je sens que ça bien se passer,
vraiment bien.
N'est-ce pas la meilleure chose qu'on puisse faire ?
Essayez, malgré tout ?
J'essaie, crois-moi.
Je...
mais c'est comme si nous ne serions
jamais seul.
Il y a toi, moi, April,
et c'est elle qui pleure.
Bien, je pense que je dois y aller.
Super.
Maintenant April et moi
pleurons toutes les deux.
Non, écoutes, ça n'est pas
tout à fait ça.
Tu ne peux pas me jeter
aussi facilement...
mais j'ai un travail à faire à Londres.
C'est dans cinq jours.
Laissons-nous ce temps pour y penser.
Cinq jours ?
Tu veux venir ?
Non.
Si.
Je...
Part.
S'il te plaît.
Je t'appelle dès que je reviens, ok ?
mais...
mais tu sais...
même si Maia n'avait jamais
fait de prédiction...
Je penserais toujours que nous sommes fait
l'un pour l'autre.
Kyle.
Alana.
Thomas.
J'ai essayé de te joindre.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Kyle s'en va.
Quoi ?
Il fait ses bagages à l'étage.
Kyle, que fais-tu ?
Je suis content que tu sois à la maison.
Je détestais l'idée de partir
sans te dire au revoir.
Où vas-tu ?
C'est Collier qui a envoyé
cette limousine ?
J'ai un boulot.
Je vais voyager à travers le pays
pendant un moment,
Tenir ces ateliers dans
les centres pour 4400,
parler de ma vie,
de tout ce qui m'est arrivé...
répandre la parole.
Kyle, ça ne peut pas
attendre quelques jours ?
Nous devrions en parler.
Ca ne sert à rien d'en parler.
Tu vas me manquer papa,
mais je dois le faire.
Je viens de rentrer.
Tu as dit que je devrais avancer.
C'est ce que je vais faire.
Soit heureux pour moi.
J'essaie, Kyle.
J'essaie vraiment.
Je dois y aller.
Je dois vraiment y aller.
Hé...
laisse-moi t'aider.
Merci, papa.
C'est magnifique.
N'est-ce pas.
Ils vont la rechercher.
Nous devons nous en débarrasser
dès que possible.
Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi la prendre après tout ?
Pourquoi ne pas la détruire ici ?
Nous n'allons pas la détruire.
Très bien, je vais poser la question.
Qu'allons-nous faire avec 17432
unités de promicine ?
Nous allons la donner.
A qui ?
A tout le monde.

over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted
all at once they were returned
with no memory of
where they've been
they haven't aged a day
and some have returned
with new abilities
all are trying to reconnect...
...with a life interrupted
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on the 4400...
do you know who I am?
As soon as I am free,
you and the world will know what I know.
My son is in prison.
You're the only one who can get him out.
Did you...
kill me?
That's jordan collier!
Tell them I didn't kill you!
You're going to get married.
I saw it.
Did you happen to see who the lucky guy was?
Someone just told me that I met
the woman that I'm supposed to be with,
and I can't ignore it.
He broke up with me!
I've done bad things.
You are the enemy.
Tell me what to do.
I'll do anything.
Leave the 4400 center and never come back.
They won't be able to hide for long.
Dr.Burkhoff's not exactly inconspicuous.
We are proud to announce the existence
of this enhanced soldier program.
In time,
they'll become the first non-4400s
to develop extrahuman abilities
in the defense of the united states.
You have a source of promicin
for your program.
Who is it?
That stuff happens way above
my security clearance.
The soldiers you're creating,
are you really going to use
them to defend the country,
or are you just going to send
them after the 4400?
Is there a difference?
Mr.Collier, you've been doing
quite a bit of press since your...
resurrection?
I suppose some people are calling it that.
And in every interview,
you've been making the same
statement over and over again--
"the war for the future will
be fought in the past."
Exactly...
and by "past,"
do you mean now?
Today?
It's our shared burden, yes.
And this war,
it's one between 4400s and the non-4400s?
No.
This is a war between good and evil,
and it has already started.
Good people,
4400s and non-4400s...
come on, kyle.Dinner's ready.
-Have already ...
-I'll be right there.
made incredible sacrifices,
and they know they will be called
on to sacrifice even more.
They are among the first to
know the cost of this struggle,
because,
for better or worse,
all our lives are different now,
profoundly different.
That's what wars do.
They change us.
But the stakes...
the stakes are nothing
less than the fate of mankind.
But why does there need to be a war at all?
I've seen the future,
and it's a bleak one.
The human race is old,
it's sick, it's dying.
What's left of civilization is controlled
by a brutal and powerful elite
who have effectively shut themselves
off in the world's last city
while the rest of humanity struggle for survival
in the surrounding wasteland.
Sounds pretty hopeless.
Doesn't it?
But there is hope,
there is always hope,
and it rests with us.
We can change the future,
but we must start now.Today.
Everything crucial to
the world's survival, its prosperity--
the resources of this planet,
food, water, energy,
the genetic materials of life itself--
already, even as I speak,
are being gathered up and controlled
by a powerful and isolated few.
This must stop.
We must stop it.
Our enemies are strong,
and they grow stronger daily,
and they will go to any lengths
to maintain their dominance,
to confine us to our current path,
a path leading only to disaster,
only to the catastrophic future that awaits us.
We must band together to fight this...
this evil amongst us,
an evil that would destroy us all.
We won't have another chance.
Look, I'm telling you,
I don't know what happened.
I'm going over the night
bulletins with havemeyer,
next thing you know,
I got drool all over my shirt
and havemeyer's snoring in my ear.
You're saying the entire night
shift just fell asleep?
Fell asleep, passed out...
I don't remember.
What the hell is going on?
Good question.
I've got an entire building full of
agents who can't remember a damn thing.
While they were napping,
every member of the nova group in ntac
custody walked out the front door.
Yeah, walked, ran, flew--
no way of knowing,since they erased
the security tapes on the way out.
But every 4400 downstairs gets
injected with the promicin inhibitor,
so none of them could've used
their abilities to escape.
They must have had help.
Someone on the outside.
A 4400.
No, more than one.
Someone to knock our people out,
another to disable the security system.
So are we talking sympathizers
or members we've never caught?
Either way, it looks like someone's
putting the nova group back together.

The.4400.
Season 03 Episode 12
Paul newbold has the ability to raise
or lower body temperature.
Tina richardson.
She wipes memories.
She can make you forget what you had for breakfast
or she can erase your entire life.
Then there's my old friend, boyd gelder,
who can take over your entire life.
The ultimate impersonator.
Any one of these people is capable
of wreaking serious havoc.
they've done it before.
We have to assume someone broke them out
so they could do it again.
The nova group has a lot of scores to settle...
starting with your nephew.
I called shawn.
The 4400 center's already a fortress,
but he'll make sure to kick it up a level.
Dennis ryland's got to be high on their hit list.
and alana, and kyle.
Boyd came after my family before.
Go.
I'll send some agents over to watch your house.
Agent baldwin,
why won't your son make a statement?
Did someone pay him to shoot jordan collier?
Did he always know collier was alive?
So how long are we going to be stuck in here?
A few days, a couple of months?
Hopefully not too long.
We caught boyd gelder once.
We'll track him down again.
In the meantime, kyle,
you need to stay close to home.
Don't go anywhere unless it's
absolutely necessary.
Thhouldn't be too bad.
After all, you could still be in prison.
I could still be living on the run.
Compared to that,
staying close to home is kind of nice...
and before you know it,
you'll be heading back to school.
She has a point, kyle.
Did you see those registration
forms I left for you?
If you like, I could...
you know, I could run them over
to the admissions office.
I'm not sure I'm ready to go back to school.
You want to wait a semester, that's up to you,
but I figured, you know,
going back to school would help things
get back to normal.
Dad, have you looked outside?
That's not going to happen.
Kyle, you just...
you just have to be patient.
Dad, I know you're trying to help,
but jordan collier came back from the dead.
No one's ever going to forget that.
And as long as they remember jordan collier,
they're going to remember the guy who shot him.
I warned nina jarvis.
I told her that ntac was totally unprepared
for the threat posed by these people.
Did she listen?
No...
and here's the result.
Ntac is literally asleep at their desks
while the most dangerous 4400s stroll
out the door.
We're talking about the nova group.
Violent terrorists.
This isn't about the 4400.
Tom,
I'm sure you'll agree that that
distinction's become meaningless.
Every one of the 4400 has developed an ability.
That means every 4400 is a potential enemy.
My daughter's in the fifth grade.
She isn't anyone's enemy.
Children grow up, diana.
Dennis,
we don't know what the nova is planning.
But they have targeted you before.
Now, ntac is ready to offer you any protection
you might need.
that's very generous, tom,
but if my memory serves me,
the nova group made two attempts on my life
while I was under ntac protection.
Two unsuccessful attempts.
Don't sound so disappointed.
Would you come in a moment, please?
This time, I'm arranging for my own security.
Hello.
We were just discussing the newest
threat posed by the nova group.
there is no threat.
Not while I'm around, anyway.
Your uncle...
he actually saw them together?
My daughter and ryland?
At least nowe know where she's been
for the last week.
Jordan should've talked to us before
he made her leave.
It's like he delivered her right to ryland.
I don't know about that.
If she's the source of ryland's promicin,
that means that she was working with
him long before she left the center.
****Talk to her.
Make sure she knows who she's working with.
When my daughter's made up her mind,
there's no changing it.
You know that.
I'm sorry, richard.
All her life,
I've been trying to see something good
in isabelle,
some kind of light,
something to nurture.
Maybe I've just been wasting my time...
because it's never been there.
Hi.I'm home.
I didn't get a chance to get the store.
I thought we could...
order in a pizza.
Don't worry about me.
I already ate.
I can see that.
Why won't he call me back?
Who?
Ben?
I left him five messages.
I just want him to know that I forgive him,
you know?
It's probably my fault.
Probably pushed him away.
sitting here blaming yourself is not helping.
Do you think he met someone else?
You need to get up.
Take a shower,
change your clothes,
and let's all go out to dinner.
What if he calls?
Answer my cell, okay?
Sure.
And if he calls,
be nice to him,
because when we get back together,
I do not want there to be any weirdness
between the two of you.
Hi, honey.
We had a deal.
No video games before dinner.
Maia...
I needed a break.
From what?
Aunt april.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
She hasn't stopped from the second
I came home from school.
She keeps asking me
if they're going to get back together.
you're going to have to go easy on your
aunt april.
She's going through a really rough time.
But you and ben,
you're supposed to be together.
Maybe if you told her about what I saw...
somehow I don't think that's going
to make her feel better.
she's going to know about you two sooner or later.
I mean...
you are going to invite her to your wedding.
What do you think?
You look remarkable.
I'm impressed.
Jordan.
Are we interrupting something?
No, not at all.
Is everything okay?
Not really.
We just talked to my uncle tommy.
He told us that...
isabelle and dennis ryland are working together.
I see.
Jordan...
did you hear what I just told you?
Kicking isabelle out of here may not
have been the best decision.
While isabelle was here, she was a threat.
Her alliance with dennis ryland simply
makes it clear where her loyalty lies,
and clarity's a good thing, yes?
But we still have...
preparations to make around this place,
just to be safe.
It's not only isabelle and ryland out there.
We also have the nova group to worry about.
The nova group is no longer our enemy.
Isn't that right?
We don't have a problem with you.
Not anymore.
Shawn,
richard...
have you met boyd gelder?
As you can see,
he's quite an impersonator.
What's one of the nova doing here?
He is a 4400, shawn.
Where else should he be?
Besides,
I went to a great deal of trouble
to get him and his friends out of ntac.
Jordan, this is crazy.
I put my life on the line trying to protect
this place from the nova group,
and now we're the ones that break
them out from ntac?
What were you thinking?
That we have a war to fight.
That nova is a powerful weapon,
which, until now, hs lacked proper guidance.
Jordan, they're terrorists.
They kill people.
They did what needed doing.
They chose action over accommodation.
Not supporting that choice was a failure, shawn.
Oh, so I made a mistake by not
backing the nova group?
I'm saying you should've been a leader.
These people are willing to sacrifice
themselves for the greater good.
They're the kind of soldiers we need
in this fight.
Jordan,
they're one of the biggest reasons
why people are scared of us,
so if we invite them in here,
then we become part of the nova group,
and everything that you've been
preachingince you've been back,
about cooperation and unity between
4400s and non-4400s,
it's never going to happen.
Richard?
We're running a big risk here, jordan.
We're playing for big stakes.
If ntac finds out we were involved
in the breakout,
it'll be bad.
You sure you covered your tracks here?
They're someplace safe?
Along with the 4400s who helped free them.
They won't be found.
No, no, no, no.
Just because we're not going to get
caught doesn't make this okay.
Richard,
no, tell me you're not buying into this.
I'm just being realistic.
The fact is,
we're more vulnerable than ever.
Isabelle's with ryland now.
It's only a matter of time
before those soldiers of his are out
there developing abilities.
Jordan is right.
We're playing for big stakes now.
Another month?
That's completely unacceptable.
The initial volunteers were showing
abilities within days.
That's correct,
but as you recall,
there were problems.
Deaths.
Since the piersahl incident,
we've scaled back the pace of the
promicin injections.
I never authorized that.
I guaranteed this country the
protection of enhanced troops.
I won't be made a liar by you.
Increase the dosage.
I'll have another shipment of promicin
sent over from haspelcorp today.
I don't know why you're wasting time
building an army.
You won't need one.
You're a very powerful young woman, isabelle,
but you're still one person.
Think of it as backup.
if that makes you feel more secure...
but by now, collier knows we're working together.
He won't wait a month to come after us.
If we give those soldiers the
maximum dose of promicin,
how long before they develop abilities?
Anywhere from two to three days.
Make it two.
Why wait?
You heard the lady.
I'll be staying on base to monitor your progress.
Kyle.
There he is.
Look at you, man.
You look great.
I can't believe you're standing here.
We have to celebrate,
or we've got to do something.
Yeah, that sounds good.
first I need to ask a favor of you.
Name it.
It's good to see you, kyle.
I was hoping we could talk.
It's really you, isn't it?
You're alive.
It took a while to believe it myself.
I'm sorry...
for what I did to you.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
My death had to happen.
I've seen you on tv.
You seem so sure that what we all
went through means something.
I wish I could understand it the way you do.
To me, it all seems like a waste.
My death was part of a bigger plan.
I know you've suffered for it,
and that was unfair,
but everything you did, kyle,
including my assassination,
was part of that plan.
You have no idea how important you are.
Tell me we can spend the whole night together.
You know, I think that maia should
be there when I tell her.
That way, at least she can explain the
whole prediction thing.
so much for afterglow.
Please tell me you weren't thinking
of april the whole time.
No.
I wasn'T.
You're right.
We should tell her.
I should do it.
She should hear it from me.
That'd be like hiding behind you, and
I admit, that sounds good right now, but...
I'd just only hate myself even more.
I just wish I knew what to say.
Tell her the truth.
You know?
We didn't plan this.
We didn't even want it...
but it happened.
We fell in love.
Isn't it a bit early to be using that word?
What would you call it?
god.
It's true.
Two weeks, and I'm in love.
It's a good thing.
I know it is.
I mean, it should be, buT...
I'm in love, and I can't enjoy it.
How pathetic is that?
What's all this?
I had a lot of time on my hands.
I thought someone should benefit from it.
Not you.
Kyle.
I'm making penne arrabiata.
I bet you he hasn't had it in a while.
Where's kyle?
He'll be home any minute.
He went out?
After I told him not to?
He drove to northmount.
He wanted to register for some classes.
That's great.
How'd he get past the reporters?
They don't even know he's gone.
I made a pitcher of ice tea and some sandwiches,
and I brought it out to them,
and I distracted them while kyle
slipped out the back.
We planned the whole thing together.
It was fun.
I'm glad someone had a good day.
I take you didn't have a good day at work?
No.
We talked to the family of every prisoner we lost.
No one's heard or seen anything.
I mean, not that they'd give up
their loved ones so easily...
and then there's always the 4400
who broke them out.
Excuse me, honey.
We haven't made much headway on that front either.
Kyle's going to be a happy man.
You'd think we would've heard something
about a 4400
who can override a state-of-the-art
security system,
or cut off oxygen to a whole building
full of people.
I had a student at the center.
When he first came to school,
he had some problems.
Teachers and the other children kept having
headaches and fainting when he was around.
It turns out that it was something
about his ability
to change the level of oxygen in the blood.
Alana, this student, what was his name?
Michael lawrence?
You think he had something to do
with the prison break?
He's 16, you guys.
his ability matches up to
what happened to our agents.
And boyd gelder isn't much older.
Now, we've spoken to michael's father.
He says he hasn't seen his son in a week.
Shawn,
is it possible there's a new
nova cell operating out of the center?
if there were,
don't you think they would've come
after me by now?
they still might.
We don't know what they're planning.
Do you mind if we talk to some of the
other students,
see what they can tell us about michael?
Talk to whoever you like.
Listen, shawn...
look, I appreciate this.
You know, it really helps to have
someone here we can work with.
I hope that doesn't change now
that collier's back.
All right.
Michael lawrence's ability is unique, useful,
and he controls it with a great deal of accuracy.
Why wouldn't i make use of him?
Because he's a 16-year-old kid you
just turned into a felon.
Shawn, that boy allowed us
to neutralize a building full of ntac
agents without hurting anyone.
I think I showed great restraint,
given the urgency of our needs.
What needs, jordan?
What is so important that we need to
get into bed with the nova group?
Come on.
I ran this place while you were gone.
I think I deserve to know what you're planning.
Ryland's enhanced soldier program.
We're going to destroy it.
Destroy how?
With nova's help,
we'll attack the army base where
the experiment's conducted,
take out the lab, the training facility,
and when we find the soldiers getting promicin...
neutralize them.
Attack a military installation?
Jordan, are you insane?
That's how you sound right now.
I don't care what you think
you saw while you were gone.
This is the real world.
Jordan, listen to me.
Do you know how many people would die?
On both sides.
We have no choice.
Once those soldiers develop 4400 abilities...
it'll be too late.
there's a gas station.
It's on a highway.
Next to it there's a road sign.
Can you read the sign?
I'm trying.
Something about a petrified tree stump.
It's the biggest one in the state.
Afraid that's all of it.
That's the thing with this remote viewing--
I never quite see everything.
That ought to be enough to find them.
The gas...
and a quart of oil comes to...
53 even.
Okay.
Hope you're going to take some time
and visit newfield's claim to fame.
There's not another stump like it
on the whole west coast.
We're just passing through.
If I...
if I go back the way I came,
will I find the highway?
Oh, she can help you with that.
He wants to get right back on the highway.
That's easy...
but first,
I think you should visit the newfield stump.
They have a really nice gift shop there.
The town could sure use your business.
I just follow the sign?
That's right,
and there's a nice diner along the way.
All the pies are baked fresh.
Sounds good.
We'll check that out.
Thank you.
You won't be disappointed.
Those pies come in on a truck.
They need the business.
Dr.Burkhoff.
Ms.Dorner.
I'm jordan collier.
I'm betting this isn't a coincidence.
How's your research coming?
It keeps my nights interesting.
Mr.Collier...
we've made a nice life for ourselves.
This is a good place for us,
and we like to think that we make
things a little better by being here.
Please don't ruin it.
Were it up to me, you'd live here happily
many years,
but right now,
I need your ability and your intellect.
sweetie.
I think it's grilled cheese wednesday.
Where's your aunt april?
Please don't be mad.
Why would I be mad?
You didn'T.
I thought it'd make her feel better,
knowing about my vision,
that it's not her fault
that ben likes you more.
And did it make her feel better?
Not really.
She's in your room.
April?
In here.
You're out of tissues.
There's more under the bathroom sink.
You know...
one of the reasons that I liked
ben in the first place
was because I thought,
"here's a guy "
my sister would approve of...
finally.
you were right.
This was it.
My one chance to settle down
with the right guy...
except it turns out he's your right guy.
god, april...
this whole thing with ben...
I mean, we never meant for it to happen.
I...
I know that doesn't help much.
I know I'll meet another guy.
I always do.
Meeting them,
sleeping with them,
going to the fetish ball with them...
that's not the problem.
Finding one that wants to go to the
fetish ball with me year after year...
that's the problem.
Ben was willing to go to the fetish ball with you?
He was considering it.
Look, di...
I wish I could hate you,
I really do,
but I'm too busy hating me.
I'm such a loser.
No...
no, you're not.
Yes, I am.
I'm going to live alone
and I'm going to die alone,
and all I'm ever going to be to anyone is
"aunt april, the loser."
kyle, you got a second?
just getting rid of some old stuff.
Come on, dad.
I was nine when I got that.
Yeah, I remember the day.
Listen, kyle...
once you go back to school,
I thought I'd float you some cash.
That way, you can get your own place,
so can have some privacy, some independence.
I saw jordan collier yesterday.
You went to the center?
Why?
I had to see him.
We talked.
He helped me realize some things.
What things?
I'm not going back to college, for one.
Dad, just listen to me.
Hear me out.
My life, my future,
it's tied up with the 4400.
That night on the beach when shawn was taken,
it should've been me.
If he hadn't have pushed me out of
that beam of light,
I would've been one of them.
Yeah, but you're not.
Kyle, your life can be whatever you want it to be.
You just have to be willing to move forward.
Ever since I woke up from that coma,
I thought I was moving forward,
but jordan helped me realize all
I was doing was running away.
He told you that?
He told you not to go to college?
No, dad, he just listened to me.
I figured it out on my own.
So, what do you do now, kyle?
You put on a blue blazer,
become one of his disciples?
Give tours of the center, answer phones?
Maybe.
I'm going to do what you do, dad.
I'm going to help the 4400 any way I can.
I'm sorry.
I agree with jordan on this one, shawn.
How can you say that?
If we attack that army base,
it's like declaring war on the united states
government.
Maybe so,
but it seems to me we have been in an
undeclared war with the government
ever since we got back.
Locking us in quarantine.
Shooting us up with the inhibitor.
Disappearing any of us they--
they-- they seem threatened by.
All jordan's doing is bringing the
conflict out into the open.
Jordan's going to sacrifice thousands of lives.
It's going to be for nothing.
We're going to lose.
If you have another way,
something concrete that makes us safer...
I'm willing to listen.
my god.
I didn't think so.
Okay, can you give us a hint what this is about?
You said it was urgent.
The nova members that escaped...
I know what they're planning...
and who their leader is.
Okay.
Shawn...
I'm going to need a name.
Jordan collier.
you must think I'm insane.
Only a psychopath would declare
war on the U.S.Army.
then we're all in agreement.
I assure you,
I am not crazy.
I'm not planning attack on any
government installation.
So you're saying shawn made all this up?
Why would I do that?
Jordan, just...
tell the truth, okay?
You can't cover this up.
I told you a story, shawn,
to see if you would pass it along.
It was a test...
and I'm afraid you failed.
I've been away from this place for a long time.
In the days ahead,
I will be asking a lot of everyone here.
I needed to know who I could trust...
and who I couldn'T.
I'm sorry to embarrass you like this.
It was the only way to be sure.
And what about the breakout at nta
you had nothing to do with that either?
I did not.
That is a lie.
That's a lie.
I saw boyd gelder standing in this
office with my own two eyes.
Richard was here with me.
He saw him, too.
Richard?
I don't know what you're talking about, shawn.
Richard...
As far as I know,
boyd gelder has never been here.
So you're saying,
in spite of all collier's denials,
this base is still the subject of
a possible nova attack?
It's possible, yes.
And you came all this way to warn me?
I'm touched, tom.
Just doing my job, dennis.
It's nothing personal.
Collier knows you're here,
so this place is no longer secure.
Your little experiment needs a new home.
I say let them come.
If collier wants a fight,
we'll give him one.
She's right, you know.
Collier talks a good game--
unity, fighting together to save the future...
people actually believe he means it.
It's pathetic.
But an attack will expose the 4400 for
what they really are--
the enemy.
You see, tom?I was right all along.
It comes down to survival.
Us against them.
You sure you want to be at ground
zero for this one, dennis?
Defending the human race?
Where else would I be?
We're staying right here.
How did it feel,
turning your back on me?
I was just trying to save lives.
Yours included.
You know, maybe if you'd told me everything,
treated me with a little respect,
we could've worked things out,but no,
you were too busy manipulating me, like always.
You know, jordan,while you were gone...
I ran this place,
and I did a pretty good job of it, too.
Now you're back.
You and I,
it's like nothing's changed.
You make all the decisions,
and I play catch-up.
Five steps behind.
Used to be 10.
Shawn...
I need you to believe in me.
Do you know what I think, jordan?
I think that this whole messiah
thing has gone to your head.
I'm no messiah.
More like...
john brown.
John brown?
The guy that tried to free all the slaves?
He surrounded himself with people
who believed as he did,
who were willing to do anything
for their cause,
and that kind of devotion can
change the world.
They killed john brown, jordan.
They killed me, too.
mr.Ryland.
I was told we wouldn't be seeing you for a while.
We have a security situation.
Ntac intelligence has gotten word that
jordan collier may be planning a move against us.
I want to transfer all the promicin
out of haspelcorp for safekeeping.
I want every vial packed and ready for
shipment as soon as possible.
Yes, sir.
Give us a hand here.
We've got a lot of crates to move.
I wanted them loaded up as soon as possible.
we'll take it from here.
The military base was never collier's target.
He wanted to divert us from his real goal.
The promicin.
You had enough stored here to create
a whole army of enhanced soldiers.
Before collier's done,
you'll wish you had that army for protection.
I wonder what he'll do with all of it.
Destroy it.
He doesn't want anyone else to develop abilities.
He wants to keep us weak,
so no one can fight back.
Sounding a little paranoid, dennis.
Collier's a fanatic, tom.
He's capable of anything.
You'll see.
So you're saying you want to break up?
I don't want to.
then let's not.
Look, I know how bad you feel--
I feel bad, too--
but I also feel really,
really good.
Isn't that worth holding on to?Trying, at least?
I'm trying, believe me.
I...
but it's like we're never alone.
There's you, me, and april,
and she's the one crying.
Yeah, I think I need to leave.
great.
Now april and i are both crying.
No, look, I didn't mean for good.
You can't get rid of me that easily...
but I do have a job to do in london.
It's five days.
It'll give us some time to think things over.
Five days?
Want to come?
No.
Yes.
I...
just leave.
Please.
I'll call you as soon as I get back, okay?
just...
just so you know...
even if maia never made any prediction...
I'd still think we're meant for each other.
kyle.
Alana.
Thomas.
I've been trying to reach you.
What is it?What's wrong?
Kyle's leaving.
What?
He's upstairs packing.
Kyle, what are you doing?
I'm glad you're home.
I would've hated to leave without saying goodbye.
Where are you going?
Did collier send that limo?
I got a job.
I'm going to travel around the
country for a little while,
hold these workshops at the 4400 centers,
talk about my life,
everything that's happened to me...
spread the word.
Kyle, can't you take a couple of days?
You know, think this obout this.
There's nothing to talk about.
I'm going to miss you, dad,
but I've got to do this.
I just got you home.
You said I should move forward.
That's what I'm doing.
Be happy for me.
I'm trying, kyle.
I'm really trying.
I got to get going.
I really got to get going.
Here...
let me help you.
Thanks, dad.
It's beautiful.
Isn't it.
They're going to be looking for it.
We've got to get rid of it, soon.
I don't understand.
Why take it at all?
Why not just destroy it there?
We're not going to destroy it.
All right, I'll ask the question.
What are we going to do with
17,432 units of promicin?
We're going to give it away.
To who?
To everyone.

The.4400.
Season 03 Episode 12
We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
Do you know who I am?
As soon as I am free, you and the world
will know what I know.
My son is in prison.
You're the one who can get him out.
Did you kill me?
That's Jordan Collier!
Tell them I didn't kill you!
You're gonna get married. I saw it.
Did you happen to see
who the lucky guy was?
Someone just told me
that I met the woman
that I'm supposed to be with,
and I can't ignore it.
He broke up with me!
- I've done bad things.
- You are the enemy.
Tell me What to do, I'll do anything,
Leave the 4400 Center
and never come back.
They won't be able to hide for long.
Dr. Burkhoff's
not exactly inconspicuous.
We are proud
to announce the existence
of this Enhanced Soldier program,
In time, they'll become
the first non-4400s
to develop extra-human abilities
in the defense of the United States,
You have a source of promicin
for your program, Who is it?
That stuff happens
way above my security clearance.
The soldiers, are you really gonna
use them to defend the country?
Or are you just gonna send them
after the 4400?
Is there a difference?
Mr. Collier, you've been doing
quite a bit of press since your...
Resurrection.
I suppose some people
are calling it that.
And in every interview, you've been
making the same statement
over and over again.
The war for the future
will be fought in the past.
Exactly. And by past,
do you mean now, today?
It's our shared burden. Yes.
And this war, it's one between
the 4400s and the non-4400s?
No, This is a War
between good and evil,
And it has already started,
Good people,
4400s and non-4400s,,,
Come on, Kyle. Dinner's ready.
-...have made incredible sacrifices,
- I'll be right there.
And they knoW they Will be called on
to sacrifice even more,
They're among the first to knoW
the cost of this struggle,
because for better or Worse,
all our lives are different noW,
Profoundly different,
That's What Wars do,
They change us,
But the stakes,,,
Well, the stakes are nothing less
than the fate of mankind.
But Why does there need to be
a War at all?
I've seen the future,
and it's a bleak one,
The human race is old,
It's sick, it's dying,
What's left of civilization is controlled
by a brutal and poWerful elite
Who have effectively
shut themselves off
in the World's last city
While the rest of humanity
struggle for survival
in the surrounding Wasteland,
- Sounds pretty hopeless,
- Doesn't it?
But there is hope.
There is alWays hope
and it rests With us,
We can change the future,
but We must start noW, today,
Everything crucial
to the World's survival, its prosperity--
The resources of this planet:
food, Water, energy,
The genetic materials of life itself,
--already, even as I speak,
are being gathered up and controlled
by a poWerful and isolated feW,
This must stop, We must stop it,
Our enemies are strong,
and they groW stronger daily,
And they Will go to any lengths
to maintain their dominance,
to confine us to our current path,
a path leading only to disaster.
Only to the catastrophic future
that awaits us.
We must band together to fight this,
this evil amongst us.
An evil that would destroy us all.
We won't have another chance.
Look, I'm telling you,
I don't know what happened, okay?
One minute I'm going over
the bulletins with Havemeyer.
Next thing I know, I got drool all over
my shirt, and Havemeyer's snoring.
So you're saying the night shift
just fell asleep?
Fell asleep, passed out.
I don't remember.
- What the hell is going on?
- Good question.
I've got an entire building full of agents
who can't remember a damn thing.
And while they were napping,
every member of the Nova Group
in NTAC custody
walked out the front door.
Yeah, walked, ran, flew.
No way of knowing since they erased
the security tapes.
But every 4400 downstairs gets
injected with the promicin inhibitor.
So none of them
could've used their abilities to escape.
They must have had help.
Someone on the outside, a 4400.
No, more than one.
Someone to knock our people out,
another to disable the security system.
So we talking sympathizers
or members we've never caught?
Either way, it looks like someone's
putting the Nova Group back together.
Paul Newbold has the ability
to raise or lower body temperature.
Tina Richardson,
she wipes memories.
She can make you forget
what you had for breakfast,
or she can erase your entire life.
Then there's my old friend
Boyd Gelder,
who can take over your entire life.
The ultimate impersonator.
Any one of these people is capable
of wreaking serious havoc.
Well, they've done it before.
We have to assume someone broke
them out so they could do it again.
The Nova Group has a lot of scores
to settle, starting with your nephew.
I called Shawn.
The 4400 Center's already a fortress.
But he'll make sure
to kick it up a level.
Dennis Ryland's gotta be high
on their hit list.
Yeah, and Alana and Kyle.
Boyd came after my family before.
Go. I'll send some agents over
to watch your house.
It's him. Here we go.
- Can we ask you one question, sir?
- Agent Baldwin, one more question.
Agent Baldwin,
why won't your son make a statement?
Did someone pay him
to shoot Jordan Collier?
Did he always know Collier
was alive?
Just one question.
So how long are we gonna be stuck
in here, a few days, couple of months?
Hopefully not too long.
We caught Boyd Gelder once,
we'll track him down again.
In the meantime, Kyle,
you need to stay close to home.
Don't go anywhere
unless it's absolutely necessary.
That shouldn't be too bad.
After all, you could still be in prison,
I could still be living on the run.
Compared to that,
staying close to home is kind of nice.
And before you know it,
you'll be heading back to school.
She has a point, Kyle.
Did you see those registration forms
I left for you?
If you like, I could--
You know, I could run them over
to the admissions office.
I'm not sure I'm ready
to go back to school.
If you wanna wait a semester,
that's up to you.
But I figured, you know,
going back to school
will help things get back to normal.
Dad, have you looked outside?
- That's not going to happen.
- Kyle, you just have to be patient.
Dad, I know you're trying to help,
but Jordan Collier came back
from the dead.
No one's ever gonna forget that.
As long as they remember
Jordan Collier,
they're gonna remember
the guy who shot him.
I warned Nina Jarvis.
I told her that NTAC
was totally unprepared
for the threat posed by these people.
Did she listen? No.
And here's the result.
NTAC is literally asleep
at their desks,
while the most dangerous 4400s
stroll out the door.
We're talking about the Nova Group.
Violent terrorists.
This isn't about the 4400.
Tom, I'm sure you'll agree that
that distinction's become meaningless.
Every one of the 4400
has developed an ability.
That means every 4400
is a potential enemy.
You know, my daughter's in the
5th grade. She isn't anyone's enemy.
Children grow up, Diana.
Look, Dennis, we don't know
what the Nova is planning.
But they have targeted you before.
Now, NTAC is ready to offer you
any protection you might need.
Well, that's very generous, Tom.
But if my memory serves me,
the Nova Group
made two attempts on my life
while I was under NTAC protection.
Two unsuccessful attempts.
Don't sound so disappointed.
Would you come in a moment,
please?
This time I'm arranging
for my own security.
Hello.
We were just discussing the newest
threat posed by the Nova Group.
Oh, there is no threat.
Not while I'm around anyway.
Your uncle,
he actually saw them together?
My daughter and Ryland?
At least now we know
where she's been for the last week.
Jordan should have talked to us
before he made her leave.
It was like he delivered her
right to Ryland.
I don't know about that.
If she's the source
of Ryland's promicin,
that means that she was working
with him
Iong before she left the Center.
Maybe one of us could talk to her
and make sure she knows
who she's working with.
When my daughter's
made up her mind,
there's no changing it.
You know that.
I'm sorry, Richard.
All her life, I've been trying
to see something good in lsabelle.
Some kind of light,
something to nurture.
Maybe I've just been
wasting my time...
...because it's never been there.
Maia, I'm home.
I didn't get a chance
to get to the store.
I thought we could order in a pizza.
Don't worry about me. I already ate.
Oh, I can see that.
Why won't he call me back?
Who? Ben?
I left him five messages.
I just want him to know
that I forgive him, you know?
It's probably my fault.
I probably pushed him away.
Well, sitting here blaming yourself
is not helping.
Do you think he met someone else?
You need to get up, take a shower,
change your clothes.
And let's all go out to dinner.
What if he calls?
Answer my cell, okay?
Sure.
And if he calls, be nice to him.
Because when we
get back together,
I do not want there to be
any weirdness between the two of you.
Hi, honey.
We had a deal.
No video games before dinner.
- Maia.
- I needed a break.
- From what?
- Aunt April.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
She hasn't stopped from the second
I came home from school.
She keeps asking me
if they're gonna get back together.
Well, you're gonna have to go easy
on your Aunt April.
She's going through
a really rough time.
But you and Ben,
you were supposed to be together.
Maybe if you told her
about what I saw...
Somehow I don't think
that's gonna make her feel better.
Well, she's gonna know
about you two sooner or later.
I mean, you are going to invite her
to your wedding.
What do you think?
You look remarkable. I'm impressed.
Jordan?
Are we interrupting something?
No. Not at all.
Is everything okay?
Not really.
We just talked to my Uncle Tommy.
He told us that lsabelle
and Dennis Ryland
are working together.
I see.
Jordan, did you hear
what I just told you?
Kicking lsabelle out of here
may not have been the best decision.
While lsabelle was here,
she was a threat.
Her alliance with Dennis Ryland
simply makes it clear
where her loyalty lies.
And clarity's a good thing, yes?
But we still have preparations to make
around this place just to be safe.
Yeah.
It's not only lsabelle and Ryland
out there.
We also have Nova Group
to worry about.
The Nova Group is no longer
our enemy, isn't that right?
We don't have a problem with you.
Not anymore.
Shawn, Richard,
have you met Boyd Gelder?
As you can see,
he's quite the impersonator.
What's one of the Nova doing here?
He is a 4400, Shawn.
Where else should he be?
And besides,
I went to a great deal of trouble
to get him and his friends
out of NTAC.
Jordan, this is crazy.
I put my life on the line
trying to protect this place from Nova.
And now we're the ones
that break them out from NTAC?
- What were you thinking?
- That we have a war to fight.
That Nova is a powerful weapon,
which until now,
has lacked proper guidance.
Jordan, they're terrorists.
They kill people.
They did what needed doing.
They chose action
over accommodation.
Not supporting that choice
was a failure, Shawn.
Oh, so I made a mistake
by not backing the Nova Group?
I am saying
you should have been a leader.
These people are willing to sacrifice
themselves for the greater good.
They're the kind of soldiers
we need in this fight.
They're one of the biggest
reasons why people are scared of us.
If we invite them in here,
we become part of the Nova Group.
And everything you've been preaching
since you've been back
about cooperation and unity
between 4400s and non-4400s?
It's never gonna happen.
Richard?
We're running
a big risk here, Jordan.
We're playing for big stakes.
If NTAC finds out we were involved
in the breakout, it'd be bad.
You're sure you covered your tracks?
They're someplace safe?
Along with the 4400s
who helped free them.
They won't be found.
No, no, no, just because
we're not gonna get caught
doesn't make this okay, Richard.
No, tell me
you're not buying into this.
I'm just being realistic.
The fact is we are
more vulnerable than ever.
Isabelle's with Ryland now.
It's only a matter of time
before those soldiers of his
are out there developing abilities.
Jordan is right.
We're playing for big stakes now.
Another month?
That's completely unacceptable.
The initial volunteers
were showing abilities within days.
That's correct, but as you recall,
there were problems. Deaths.
Since the Piersahl incident, we've
scaled back the pace of the promicin.
I never authorized that.
I guaranteed this country
the protection of enhanced troops.
I won't be made a liar by you.
Increase the dosage.
I'll have another shipment of promicin
sent over from Haspel Corp. today.
I don't know why we're wasting time
building an army.
We won't need one.
You're a very powerful
young woman, lsabelle.
But you're still one person.
Think of it as backup.
Well, if that makes you feel
more secure.
But by now, Collier knows
we're working together.
He won't wait a month
to come after us.
If we give those soldiers
the maximum dose of promicin,
how long
before they develop abilities?
Anywhere from two to three days.
Make it two. Why wait?
You heard the lady.
I'll be staying on base
to monitor your progress.
Kyle.
- There he is.
- Hey.
Yes.
Look at you, man. You look great.
I can't believe you're standing here.
We have to celebrate,
we gotta do something.
Yeah, that sounds good.
First I need to ask a favor of you.
Name it.
It's good to see you, Kyle.
I was hoping we could talk.
It's really you, isn't it?
You're alive.
It took a while to believe it myself.
I'm sorry for what I did to you.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
My death had to happen.
I've seen you on TV.
You seem so sure that what we all
went through means something.
I wish I could understand it
the way you do.
To me, it all seems like a waste.
My death was part of a bigger plan.
I know you suffered for it,
and that was unfair.
But everything you did, Kyle,
including my assassination,
was part of that plan.
You have no idea
how important you are.
Tell me we could spend
the whole night together.
I really think that Maia
should be there when I tell her.
That way at least she can explain
the whole prediction thing.
Well, so much for afterglow.
Please tell me you weren't thinking
of April the whole time.
No. I wasn't.
You're right.
We should tell her.
I should do it.
She should hear it from me.
That would be like hiding
behind you.
And I admit that sounds good
right now,
but I'll just only hate myself
even more.
I just wish I knew what to say.
Tell her the truth, you know.
We didn't plan this.
We didn't even want it,
but it happened.
We fell in love.
Isn't it a bit early
to be using that word?
What would you call it?
Oh, God.
It's true.
Two weeks, and I'm in love.
It's a good thing.
I know it is. I mean, it should be.
But I'm in love and I can't enjoy it.
How pathetic is that?
- What's all this?
- I have a lot of time on my hands.
I thought someone
should benefit from it.
Not you. Kyle.
I'm making penne arrabiata.
I'll bet you he hasn't had it
in a while.
- Where is Kyle?
- He'll be home any minute.
He went out? After I told him not to?
He drove to Northmount,
wanted to register for some classes.
That's great.
How did he get past the reporters?
They don't even know he's gone.
I made a pitcher of iced tea
and some sandwiches,
and I brought it out to them.
And I distracted them
while Kyle slipped out the back.
We planned the whole thing together.
It was fun.
I'm glad someone had a good day.
I take it you didn't have
a good day at work.
No. We talked to the family
of every prisoner we lost.
No one has heard or seen anything.
I mean, not that they'd give up
their loved ones so easily.
And then there's always the 4400
who broke them out.
Excuse me, honey.
We haven't made much headway
on that front either.
Kyle's gonna be a happy man.
You think we would've heard
something about a 4400
who can override
a state-of-the-art security system
or cut off oxygen
to a whole building full of people.
I had a student at the Center.
When he first came to school,
he had some problems.
Teachers and the other children
kept having headaches
and fainting when he was around.
It turns out that it was something
about his ability
to change the level of oxygen
in the blood.
Alana, this student,
what was his name?
Michael Lawrence?
You think he had something to do
with the prison break? He's 1 6.
His ability matches up
to what happened to our agents.
And Boyd Gelder isn't much older.
Now, we've spoken
to Michael's father.
He says he hasn't seen his son
in a week.
Shawn, is it possible
there's a new Nova cell
operating out of the Center?
Well, if there were, don't you think
they would've come after me by now?
Well, they still might.
We don't know what they're planning.
You mind if we talk
to some of the students?
See what they can tell us
about Michael?
Yeah, talk to whoever you like.
Listen, Shawn.
Look, I appreciate this.
You know, it really helps to have
someone here we can work with.
I hope that doesn't change
now that Collier's back.
All right.
Michael Lawrence's ability
is unique, useful,
and he controls it
with a great deal of accuracy.
Why wouldn't I make use of him?
Because he's a 1 6-year-old kid
you just turned into a felon.
Shawn, that boy allowed us
to neutralize a building
full of NTAC agents
without hurting anyone.
I think that showed great restraint,
given the urgency of our needs.
What needs, Jordan?
What's so important that we need
to get into bed with the Nova Group?
Come on, I ran this place
while you were gone.
I think I deserve to know
what you're planning.
Ryland's Enhanced Soldier program?
We're going to destroy it.
Destroy how?
With Nova's help,
we'll attack the Army base
where the experiment's conducted.
Take out the lab, the training facility.
And when we find the soldiers
getting promicin, neutralize them.
Attack a military installation?
Jordan, are you insane?
That's how you sound right now.
I don't care what you think
you saw while you were gone.
This is the real world.
Jordan, listen to me.
Do you know how many people
would die on both sides?
We have no choice.
Once those soldiers
develop 4400 abilities,
it will be too late.
There's a gas station.
It's on a highway.
Next to it there's a road sign.
- Can you read the sign?
- Trying.
Something about
a petrified tree stump.
It's the biggest one in the state,
Afraid that's all of it.
That's the thing
with this remote viewing.
I never quite see everything.
That ought to be enough
to find them.
Gas and a quart of oil
comes to 53 even.
Okay.
I hope you can take some time
and visit Newfield's claim to fame.
There's not another stump like it
on the whole West Coast.
We're just passing through.
If I go back the way I came,
will I find the highway?
Oh, she can help you with that.
He wants to get right back
on the highway.
Well, that's easy.
But first I think you should visit
the Newfield stump.
They have
a really nice gift shop there.
The town could sure use
your business.
Yeah.
- I just follow the sign?
- That's right.
And there's a nice diner
along the way.
All the pies are baked fresh.
It sounds good. I'll check that out.
Thank you.
You won't be disappointed.
Those pies come in on a truck.
They need the business.
Dr. Burkhoff, Ms. Doerner.
I'm Jordan Collier.
I'm betting this isn't a coincidence.
How is your research coming?
Keeps my nights interesting.
Mr. Collier, we've made a nice life
for ourselves.
This is a good place for us.
And we like to think that we make
things a little better by being here.
Please don't ruin it.
Were it up to me,
you'd live here happily many years.
But right now,
I need your ability and your intellect.
Oh, hey, sweetie.
I think
it's Grilled Cheese Wednesday.
Where's your Aunt April?
Please don't be mad.
Why would I be mad?
You didn't.
I thought it would make her feel better,
knowing about my vision.
That it's not her fault
that Ben likes you more.
And did it make her feel better?
No, not really.
She's in your room.
April?
In here.
You're out of tissues.
There's more
under the bathroom sink.
You know, one of the reasons
that I liked Ben in the first place
was because I thought, "Here's a guy
my sister would approve of.
Finally."
Well, you were right.
This was it.
My one chance to settle down
with the right guy.
Except it turns out
he's your right guy.
Oh, God, April.
This whole thing with Ben.
I mean, we never meant
for it to happen.
I know that doesn't help much.
I know I'll meet another guy.
I always do.
Meeting them, sleeping with them,
going to the Fetish Ball with them.
That's not the problem.
Finding one that wants to go
to the Fetish Ball with me
year after year.
That's the problem.
Ben's willing to go
to the Fetish Ball with you?
He was considering it.
Look, Di, I wish I could hate you.
I really do.
But I'm too busy hating me.
I'm such a loser.
No. No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
I'm gonna live alone
and I'm gonna die alone.
And all I'm ever gonna be to anyone
is Aunt April, the loser.
Hey, Kyle. You got a second?
Yeah, just getting rid
of some old stuff.
Come on, Dad.
I was 9 when I got that.
Yeah, I remember the day.
Listen, Kyle, you know,
once you go back to school,
I thought I'd float you some cash.
That way you can get
your own place.
so you can have some privacy,
some independence.
I saw Jordan Collier yesterday.
- You went to the Center. Why?
- I had to see him.
We talked.
He helped me realize some things.
What things?
Well, I'm not going back to college,
for one.
Dad, just listen to me. Hear me out.
My life, my future,
it's tied up with the 4400.
That night on the beach
when Shawn was taken,
it should have been me.
If he hadn't pushed me
out of that beam of light,
- I would've been one of them.
- Yeah, but you're not.
Kyle, your life can be
whatever you want it to be.
You just have to be willing
to move forward.
Ever since I woke up from that coma,
I thought I was moving forward.
But Jordan helped me realize
all I was doing was running away.
He told you that?
He told you not to go to college?!
No, Dad, he just listened to me.
I figured it out on my own.
So, what do you do now, Kyle?
You put on a blue blazer
and become one of his disciples?
Give tours at the Center?
Answer phones?
Maybe.
I'm gonna do what you do, Dad.
I'm gonna help the 4400
any way I can.
I'm sorry. I agree with Jordan
on this one, Shawn.
How can you say that?
If we attack that Army base,
it's like declaring war
on the United States government.
Maybe, but it seems to me
we have been in an undeclared war
with the government
ever since we got back.
Locking us in quarantine,
shooting us up with the inhibitor.
Disappearing any of us
they seem threatened by.
All Jordan is doing is bringing
the conflict out into the open.
Jordan is gonna sacrifice
thousands of lives.
It's gonna be for nothing.
We're gonna lose.
If you have another way,
something concrete
that makes us safer,
I'm willing to listen.
Oh, my God.
I didn't think so.
Okay, can you give us a hint
what this is about?
You said it was urgent.
The Nova members that escaped,
I know what they're planning.
I know who their leader is.
Okay.
Shawn, I'm gonna need a name.
Jordan Collier.
You must think I'm insane.
Only a psychopath
would declare war on the U.S. Army.
Well, then we're all in agreement.
I assure you, I am not crazy.
I am not planning any attack
on a government installation.
So you're saying
Shawn made all this up?
Why would I do that?
Jordan, just tell the truth, okay?
You can't cover this up.
I told you a story, Shawn,
to see if you would pass it along.
It was a test.
And I'm afraid you failed.
I've been away from this place
for a long time.
In the days ahead,
I will be asking a lot of everyone here.
I needed to know who I could trust.
And who I couldn't.
Sorry to embarrass you
like this, Shawn.
It was the only way to be sure.
And what about the breakout
at NTAC?
You had nothing to do with that?
- I did not.
- That is a lie! That's a lie!
I saw Boyd Gelder
standing in this office
with my own two eyes.
Richard was here with me.
He saw him too. Richard?
I don't know
what you're talking about, Shawn.
Richard?
As far as I know,
Boyd Gelder has never been here.
So you're saying
in spite of all of Collier's denials,
this base is still the subject
of a possible Nova attack?
It's possible, yes.
And you came all this way
to warn me?
- I'm touched, Tom.
- Just doing my job, Dennis.
It's nothing personal.
Collier knows you're here,
so this place is no longer secure.
Your little experiment
needs a new home.
I say let them come. If Collier
wants a fight, we'll give him one.
She's right, you know.
Collier talks a good game.
Unity, fighting together
to save the future.
People actually believe he means it.
It's pathetic.
But an attack will expose the 4400
for what they really are:
The enemy.
You see, Tom? I was right all along.
It comes down to survival.
Us against them.
You sure you wanna be at ground zero
for this one, Dennis?
Defending the human race?
Where else would I be?
We're staying right here.
How did it feel,
turning your back on me?
I was just trying to save lives.
Yours included.
You know,
maybe if you'd told me everything,
treated me with a little respect,
we could have worked things out.
But, no, you were too busy
manipulating me like always.
You know, Jordan,
while you were gone, I ran this place.
And I did a pretty good job of it too.
Now you're back. You and l?
It's like nothing's changed.
You make all the decisions
and I play catch up five steps behind.
It used to be ten.
Shawn, I need you to believe in me.
You know what I think, Jordan?
I think that this whole messiah thing
has gone to your head.
I'm no messiah.
More like John Brown.
John Brown? Isn't he the guy
that tried to free all the slaves?
He surrounded himself with people
who believed as he did,
were willing to do anything
for their cause.
And that kind of devotion
can change the world.
They killed John Brown, Jordan.
They killed me too.
Mr. Ryland, I was told
we wouldn't be seeing you for a while.
We have a security situation.
NTAC intelligence has gotten word
that Jordan Collier
may be planning a move against us.
I wanna transfer all the promicin
out of Haspel Corp. for safekeeping.
I want every vial packed and ready
for shipment as soon as possible.
Yes, sir.
Give us a hand here.
We've got a lot of crates to move.
I want them loaded up
as soon as possible.
We'll take it from here.
The military base
was never Collier's target.
He wanted to divert us
from his real goal.
The promicin.
Had enough stored to create
a whole army of enhanced soldiers.
Before Collier's done, you'll wish
you had that army for protection.
I wonder what he's gonna do
with all of it.
Destroy it. He doesn't want
anyone else to develop abilities.
He wants to keep us weak
so no one can fight back.
Sounding a little paranoid, Dennis.
Collier's a fanatic, Tom.
He's capable of anything. You'll see.
So you're saying
you wanna break up?
I don't want to.
Well, then let's not.
Look, I know how bad you feel.
I feel bad too,
but I also feel really good.
Isn't that worth holding on to?
Trying at least?
Well, I'm trying. Believe me.
It is like we're never alone.
There's you, me and April,
and she's the one crying.
Yeah, I think I need to leave.
Oh, great.
Now April and I are both crying.
No. Look, I didn't mean for good.
You can't get rid of me that easily.
But I do have a job to do in London.
It's five days, so it'll give us some time
to think things over.
Five days?
- Wanna come?
- No.
Yes.
Just leave. Please.
Hey.
I'll call you as soon as I get back,
okay?
Oh, just so you know.
Even if Maia
never made any prediction...
...I'd still think
we're meant for each other.
Hey, Kyle! Alana!
Thomas.
I've been trying to reach you.
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Kyle's leaving.
- What?
- He's upstairs packing.
- Kyle, what are you doing?
- Oh, I'm glad you're home.
I would've hated to leave
without saying goodbye.
Where are you going?
Did Collier send that limo?
I've got a job.
I'm gonna travel around the country
for a little while.
Hold these workshops
at the 4400 Centers.
Talk about my life,
everything that's happened to me.
- Spread the word.
- Kyle, can't you take a couple of days?
You know, think this over?
We can talk about this.
There's nothing to talk about.
I'm gonna miss you, Dad,
but I gotta do this.
I just got you home.
You said I should move forward.
That's what I'm doing.
Be happy for me.
I'm trying, Kyle.
I'm really trying.
I gotta get going.
I really gotta get going.
Here.
- Let me help you.
- Thanks, Dad.
- It's beautiful.
- lsn't it?
They're going to be looking for it.
We gotta get rid of it soon.
I don't understand.
Why take it at all?
Why not just destroy it there?
We're not going to destroy it.
All right. I'll ask the question.
What are we gonna do
with 1 7,432 units of promicin?
We're going to give it away.
To whom?
To everyone.
Durant les 60 dernières années,
4400 personnes ont été enlevées.
Toutes sont revenues en même temps.
Sans aucun souvenir d'où elles étaient.
Elles n'ont pas vieilli d'un jour.
Et certaines sont revenues
avec des nouvelles capacités.
Toutes essayent de reprendre...
...une vie interrompue.
Nous ne sommes pas une menace.
Nous sommes le salut.
Le Monde va devoir faire avec nous.
Précédemment dans Les 4400...
Vous avez disparu. Vous n'avez aucune idée
de l'endroit où vous étiez ?
Partout.
Vous ne sentirez rien, je vous le promets.
J'ai vu la catastrophe et je sais ce que nous
devons faire pour l'empêcher.
Ma vie. Mon avenir. Ils sont liés
aux 4400.
- Kyle s'en va.
- Kyle ? Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
J'ai un boulot. Je vais voyager à travers
le monde pendant un petit moment.
- Tu vas te marier.
- Et tu as pu voir qui était l'heureux élu ?
Maia. Voici mon ami, Ben.
J'ai beaucoup entendu parler de vous
jeune demoiselle.
- Tu m'as vu me marier avec le petit
ami de ma soeur ?
- Uh uh.
- Tous ces gens sont des 4400 ?
- Certains oui. D'autres espèrent le devenir.
- Bonjour. Bienvenue au Centre.
- Etes-vous une 4400 ?
Non, ma puce. Tu es ici pour prendre
une de nos plaquettes ?
Non. Nous sommes ici pour
m'inscrire à l'école.
Tu es sûre de vouloir faire ça ?
Je veux rencontrer des enfants comme moi.
Thomas.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Il est deux heures du matin.
Oui. Je n'arrivais pas à dormir.
Kyle a laissé plein d'affaires
derrière lui.
Je voulais tout rassembler et voir...
Voir s'il y a des choses qu'il
voudrait garder.
Et qu'y ait tout pour quand
il rentrera.
Désolé de t'avoir réveillée.
- Tu es certaine de vouloir faire ça ?
- Shawn...
Devon a demandé à le faire.
Elle est prête.
Depuis la première fois où je suis arrivée au
Centre, c'est ce que j'ai toujours voulu.
C'est la raison pour laquelle je suis venue.
En outre, si quelque chose ne va pas
tu es là, non ?
Hum... Je suis...
Je vous apporte un message
pour un avenir meilleur.
C'est ici. Maintenant.
Ce sérum contient de la promicine.
Tout le monde sait ce dont il s'agit.
Ce sont les neurotransmetteurs qui
donnent aux 4400 leurs capacités.
C'est ici. Maintenant. Dans nos mains...
Cette vidéo a atterri sur Internet
il y a 6 heures de cela.
Nous avons essayé de la supprimer mais elle
réapparaît tout de suite sur d'autres serveurs.
Avec cette injection, je vais entraîner mon
corps à produire de la promicine.
N'est-ce pas la femme qui
travaille pour ton neveu ?
Je vais développer une capacité
telle une 4400.
Vous aussi vous le pouvez.
L'énorme stock de promicine du
gouvernement vient d'être perdu
et le jour suivant, un employé du Centre 4400
apparaît sur Internet s'envoyant une dose.
C'est comme si Collier se fichait
de se compromettre.
Il pense vraiment que les gens vont
s'injecter ce truc ?
Et bien en tout cas ils
sont curieux.
Cette vidéo a déjà été téléchargée
plus de 100.000 fois.
Et 10 fois plus à la fin de la journée.
Collier passe peut-être pour
un prophète maintenant...
mais le businessman en lui n'est
pas tout à fait mort.
Ce mec est en train de créer un
marché pour son produit.
Ces doses vont être
distribuées partout.
Bientôt.

Episode 13 Saison 3
" Fifty-Fifty"
Voilà, vous avez inspecté partout ici,
et je crois même dans mes propriétés.
Oui. Celle que nous connaissons.
Vous n'avez pas trouvé de
promicine et vous n'en trouverez pas.
Vos employés n'ont pas l'air d'avoir
de mal à dissimuler des choses.
Il en y a une sur Internet en ce moment
même parlant du début d'une nouvelle ère.
C'est une grande idée.
J'aurais aimé y avoir pensé.
Devon est une fille courageuse. Elle a
toujours aspiré à quelque chose de plus grand.
Je ne suis pas surpris
qu'elle y soit parvenue.
Je la féliciterais...
si je savais où elle était.
Il ne s'agit pas que d'un plan.
C'est une révolution.
Vous en avez conscience, non ?
Toutes ces belles promesses sur la
promicine vont tout changer, Shawn.
Plus personne ne pourra faire
respecter l'ordre. Ce sera le chaos.
Personne ne peut prédire ce qu'il
va arriver lorsque tout le monde
un peu partout va commencer à
développer des capacités.
Tu dois nous dire où ils
gardent tout ça.
Je ne vous comprends pas.
Depuis toujours vous répétez,
que nous sommes du même côté,
nos différences important peu.
Que nos buts sont les mêmes.
Changer les choses.
Les améliorer.
Maintenant, un homme est revenu d'entre
les morts pour nous montrer le chemin.
Et vous voulez l'en arrêter.
Vous savez quoi ?
Vous ne pouvez pas.
Nos lignes téléphoniques ont été
surchargées toute la matinée.
Les gens donneraient leur vie pour
mettre la main sur une seule dose.
Oui. Et tu leur as répondu quoi ?
Je leur réponds que nous n'avons
rien à voir avec cette histoire.
Et ensuite je leur souhaite
bonne chance.
S'il est la voix de la raison,
nous sommes dans de beaux draps.
Tom...
Donne-moi un instant.
Je dois faire un truc.
Et n'oubliez pas la retenue.
Vous la mettez en haut de la divi...
Madame Skouris ?
Je peux vous aider ?
J'ai besoin de ma fille.
Quoi ?
Nous partons.
... aux 4400 leurs capacités.
Avec ces injections, je vais entraîner
mon corps à produire de la promicine.
Je vais pouvoir développer une capacité
de 4400.
Dennis.
Nous devons agir maintenant
contre Collier.
Ces doses vont être distribuées...
Comment sommes nous sensés arrêter
les 4400 si nous restons assis là
et laissons la chance à n'importe
qui d'en devenir un.
Si Collier distribue ses doses de
promicine dans les rues...
il fait le travail à notre place.
Je ne quitterai pas l'école.
Tu ne peux pas m'y forcer.
Je me plaisais là-bas.
Chérie. Je t'ai dit que le Centre est
mêlé à de sales affaires
- et tu n'y es pas en sécurité.
- Je ne suis en sécurité nulle part.
Au moins j'étais heureuse là-bas...
Mais tu t'en fiches pas mal, non ?
Ma puce. Bien sûr que non.
Et nous trouverons un moyen.
Nous referons un peu d'école à la maison.
- Ca pue l'école à la maison.
- Excuse-moi ?
Je n'en ai pas fini avec toi,
jeune fille
Ben !?
Je te croyais à Londres ?
Oui. Je n'y suis pas allé.
Ce truc "pour toujours" ne
me va pas. Je...
J'avais besoin de te voir.
Je... suis en plein milieu d'une
discussion là...
Je crois que ça peut attendre.
Entre.
April est-elle toujours là ?
Non. Elle est partie.
Je crois qu'on peut dire,
que la tempête est passée
Mais elle a seulement pris
la moitié de ses affaires.
Je l'ai appelée plusieurs fois,
aucune réponse.
Ha.
Je n'aurais pas rappelé non plus.
Ecoute, je suis désolé que ça se
passe mal entre vous deux.
Honnêtement, je n'ai pas encore
eu le temps d'y réfléchir.
Maia ne me parle plus.
Au travail, tout va mal.
Je n'ai aucune idée de comment ça va se finir.
Et si ça finit bien ?
On m'a proposé un travail en Espagne.
C'est long.
Six mois, peut-être plus.
Je pense accepter.
Tu t'en vas.
Seulement si tu viens avec moi.
Toi et Maia.
Réfléchis-y.
Tu donnes tout ce que tu as
à ton boulot depuis des années.
Il est temps que quelqu'un
d'autre reprenne le flambeau.
Ce sera mieux pour toi.
Ce sera mieux pour Maia.
J'ai pensé à partir.
Aller dans un endroit sûr.
Ca ne m'a jamais semblé possible.
Mais ça l'est.
Tu as une chance de t'en aller.
C'est important que
tu t'en rappelles.
Je me suis penché sur la vidéo de Devon Moore.
Celle qui fait le tour d'Internet.
J'ai isolé la bande son,
Eclairci le bruit de fond...
Ce bruit que vous entendez,
C'est un camion poubelle,
allant en marche arrière,
N'importe où la cassette a été faite,
Il y avait un camion poubelle
qui faisait des rondes dehors.
Ok, bien, ça diminue les possibilités.
Enfin, un peu.
Mais il doit y avoir une dizaine de quartier,
qui devait faire le ramassage
des poubelles, hier soir.
C'est exact, mais...
On dirait un sifflement de bateau.
Un sifflement de ferry, pour être exact.
Donc ils sont prêts de l'eau.
Ils sont quelque part entre
Edmonds et Woodway.
J'ai vérifié.
Ce sont les seuls quartiers près du bord de mer,
avec le ramassage des poubelles prévu hier soir.
Je me sens un peu bizarre.
C'est normal ?
Kevin se sentait pareil.
Tu as de la chance, en fait.
La promicine venant de la
société de Ryland est pure.
Ce sera plus facile pour toi.
Je me demande quelle habilité je vais avoir.
Je suis sûre qu'elle sera géniale.
Ferme les yeux, ok ?
Repose-toi.
Comment va-t-elle ?
Elle va bien.
Je crois.
Elle est fatiguée.
C'est difficile de croire que tout commence, non ?
Tout pour ce dont on a travaillé.
Ce n'est pas dur pour moi.
Je crois en toi depuis le début.
Il y a une raison pour notre disparition.
Et une raison pour notre retour.
C'est incroyable.
Tu devrais recevoir le prix Nobel.
Au lieu de ça,
on se cache comme des criminels.
Ce ne sera pas comme ça indéfiniment.
Bientôt, nous serons des héros.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Appelle Shawn !
Tiens bon... Tout va bien.
Tout va bien !
Tess, fais vite !
C'est près d'ici.
Au 3516 Bay Street, deux pâtés de maison
à l'ouest de Woodway.
Les archives municipales
disent que c'est inoccupé,
Mais des sociétés littorales
paient les taxes de propriétés.
On dirait une des maisons de sûreté de Collier.
Regarde ça.
Les services publics viennent
juste d'être mis en marche.
Allons y faire un tour,
voir qui s'y cache.
Kevin !
Ca va aller.
Il y a des hommes qui s'approchent
de la maison. Ils ont des armes.
Nous devons partir.
Shh... Shh...
Shawn, nous devons y aller.
Non.
Shawn, le NTAC est juste dehors !
Nous devons nous en aller ! Maintenant !
Non ! Je ne vais pas la laisser !
C'est bon. Ca va aller.
Devon, regarde-moi, ok ?
Continue de me regarder.
Allez-y!
<i>Devon! </i>
Devon!
Shawn!
Shawn...
Recule-toi, Shawn.
Garde bien tes mains en évidence, ok ?
Je n'ai pas pu la sauver.
Ca va aller.
Elle est morte.
Ca va aller.
Viens ici. Viens ici.
Comment c'est arrivé ?
Comment Devon a pu mourir ?
Ca n'a pas de sens.
Ryland donne cette chose à ces soldats
et ensuite ils les montrent à la télévision.
Eh bien, son corps n'a pas supporté.
Elle est morte d'un énorme anévrisme.
Shawn...
Tu as de gros ennuis,
et les gens avec qui je travaille,
ils croient que tu es impliqué
dans une conspiration
pour distribuer la promicine,
donc tu dois tout nous dire.
Qu'est-ce que tu faisais
dans cette maison ?
Qui t'a appelé ?
Je suis navré de ce qui arrivé à Devon.
Vraiment...
Mais...
Je ne peux rien vous dire.
Devon n'était pas le premier sacrifice
que le futur nous a demandé.
Elle ne sera pas la dernière.
Nous devons honorer sa mémoire.
On peut faire ça plus tard.
Le NTAC détient Shawn.
C'est une question de temps avant qu'ils
n'obtiennent de lui les coordonnées de cet endroit.
On doit tout détruire.
Déguerpir en vitesse.
Pourquoi ?
S’ils veulent venir,
qu'ils viennent.
C'est la raison de notre présence ici, non ?
J'admire ton courage.
Peut-être qu'on y sera forcé.
Mais pas maintenant.
J'ai testé Shawn pour lui rappeler sa loyauté.
Il ne nous trahira pas.
Sa loyauté n'est pas le problème.
C'est déjà arrivé avant.
Si le gouvernement veut
savoir quelque chose,
ils feront tout ce qui est en leur
pouvoir pour le savoir.
Il sera mis à l'épreuve,
oui, Richard.
Mais il résistera...
Assez longtemps pour nous laisser le temps
de commencer la distribution.
Commencer la distribution ?
Pourquoi ferais-tu ça ?
Ce truc a tué Devon.
Problème de dosage.
Ce doit être ça.
La promicine venant de ta fille
est différent de celle que j'utilise.
Elle est trop concentrée.
Richard, écoute,
la population doit développer des pouvoirs.
Si nous arrêtons maintenant,
ça fera de nous des meurtriers.
Si nous continuons,
nous sommes des meurtriers.
Jordan, c'est terminé.
J'y mets fin.
Monsieur Tyler ?
Je ne crois pas que vous devriez faire ça.
Nous sommes tous sous pression.
Peut-être que vous devriez juste vous asseoir un moment.
Nettoyez-moi tout ça.
Nous devons être prêts à partir.
Chérie, tu veux regarder un film ?
Tu choisis.
April.
Salut.
Salut.
Je suis venue chercher mes affaires.
J'ai tout préparé pour toi.
Oh.
C'est un nouveau ?
Oh. Ouais.
Un petit cadeau pour moi.
Je l'aime bien.
Di...
ne fais pas semblant, ok ?
J'ai fait ça pour me rappeler qui je suis.
Je pense que je n'étais pas faite
pour toutes...
ces choses que j'avais
planifiées avec Ben.
Je t'ai apporté quelque chose.
Oh, tu me donnes un cadeau ?
La bague de fiançailles de maman.
Je te l'ai donnée, April.
Je n'en ai pas besoin.
En plus, en quelque sorte,
je te la dois.
Je veux dire, ne me donne pas tort,
je suis toujours dégoûtée,
mais tu m'as préservé
de devenir quelqu'un
que je ne suis pas.
Merci.
Contente-toi de ne pas m'inviter
pour Thanksgiving, ok ?
Hé, encore une chose.
Quand Maïa a prédit que
tu finirais avec Ben,
t'es-tu vraiment battue contre ça ?
Aussi fort que tu m'as dit ?
Je le pensais.
Mais pour être honnête,
maintenant, je...
j...je n'en suis plus aussi sûre.
Je ne suis pas du tout surpris
qu'une fille soit morte.
C'est exactement pour cela
que nous devons retirer tout ça
des mains de Collier.
Nous devons avoir des informations
à propos de vos réserves de
promicine, Dennis.
Vos hommes travaillent dessus depuis des mois.
Avez-vous déjà vu quelque chose de tel ?
Nous avons eu des pertes
parmi les volontaires.
Des pertes ?
Combien ?
Nous avons recruté 20 hommes
pour le programme.
La moitié d'entre eux
a rejeté la promicine
dans les 48 heures après leur
première injection.
"rejeté" ?
Vous voulez dire qu'ils sont "morts"."
Nous savions qu'il y aurait
des risques, Diana.
Nous l'avons expliqué aux volontaires
avant qu'ils signent.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Vous saviez.
Vous saviez ce qui allait arriver
quand ces gens ont accepté ?
Pourquoi ne pas nous avoir dit
quand ça a été volé ?
Nous aurions pu alerter Collier,
alerter le public...
Parce que les dieux ne font pas d'erreurs.
Quel meilleur moyen de
montrer au peuple
que Collier n'est pas
une sorte de messie
que de le faire tomber face à terre en public ?
Vous vous êtes tenus tranquille
donc vous pourriez discréditer Collier ?
Une femme est morte, Dennis,
et vous êtes aussi responsable que lui
Elle n'aurait pas dû avoir d'injection
de cette promicine volée
et quiconque suivra son exemple
aura à vivre avec les conséquences...
Ou pas.
Donc cette promicine que Collier possède,
si vous la prenez,
vous avez 50% de chance
de mourir dans les 48 heures ?
Ou 50% de chance
de développer éventuellement un don.
Nous devons impliquer plus d'agents.
Je ne sais pas... 50-50.
Ce qui ne sont pas de très bons éléments.
Pour avoir une chance de devenir l'un des 4400 ?
Je pense que beaucoup de monde
saisirait cette chance.
Comment votre neveu réagit-il aux nouvelles ?
Il ne parle toujours pas.
Il ne pense pas qu'il soit possible
Collier progresse avec ce plan.
Tom, nous le travaillons depuis presqu'une journée.
Nous devons durcir l'interrogatoire,
quelques entailles.
Quoi ? Non, non, non. Pas question.
Ecoutez, je ne resterai pas les bras
croisés pendant qu'on torture Shawn.
En fait, ce n'est pas ce que j'avais en tête.
Tu veux que j'aide le NTAC
à interroger Shawn ?
Hors de question, Thomas.
Alana, je ne serais pas venu vers toi
si je ne pensais pas que c'est une bonne idée.
Ce sera un peu comme quand
tu nous as aidé avec Collier.
Tu utilises ta capacité sur lui,
et alors, quand ce sera fini...
Tu auras vu tout ce qu'il aura vu.
Tu dois juste nous dire où se trouve la promicine.
Je sais,
mais quand j'ai accepté d'aider le NTAC,
je t'ai dit que je ne ferai plus
quoi que ce soit
qui puisse blesser les 4400.
Tu aiderais Shawn.
Et si tu ne le fais pas,
le NTAC pourrait casser votre accord.
Tu redeviendrais une fugitive.
Ecoute, chérie...
ils obtiendront l'information
par tous les moyens,
et ce sera bien plus difficile pour Shawn.
Hé, au fait,
j'ai appelé Washington moi-même,
pour confirmer ce soi-disant "ordre".
Tu as fait ça, Nina.
Vois comment tu as peu d'autorité.
Que fait-il ici ?
L'Armée Américaine prend la relève
de l'interrogatoire de Shawn Farell.
Je suis ici en tant que consultant.
Nous en aurons fini avec Shawn
en quelques minutes.
Alana peut obtenir toutes les informations
dont nous avons besoin,
Rapidement et sans douleur.
Vous vous attendez à ce que nous
ayons confiance en cette femme ?
Non, on va s'occuper de ça, Tom.
J'ai confiance en mes interrogateurs.
Salut, Shawn.
On peut faire ça vite, tu sais.
Dis-moi juste où Collier garde la promicine.
Non.
Je suis curieux.
Tout le temps où nous avons préparé
notre mariage,
tu travaillais pour Ryland.
Me trahissant...
Trahissant ton père...
pourquoi ?
C'était un équilibre des pouvoirs.
J'ai été envoyée pour éliminer les 4400.
Je ne voulais vraiment pas faire ça.
Je t'aimais, Shawn.
mais j'avais une chose à faire,
donc je pensais que si je rejoignais Ryland
et j'aidais son camp à apprendre
comment créer des capacités
il y aurait une contrepartie.
Si tout le monde a la technologie...
Personne ne peut l'utiliser.
Tu as vraiment pensé que ça marcherait ?
Ryland va utiliser ces soldats
pour nous tuer tous.
Même si je ne l'apprécie pas...
Tout ce que je pourrai faire pour que
Collier ne parvienne pas à ses fins...
Je le ferai !
Bébé...
s'il te plaît...
où est la promicine ?
Bébé...
Enlève tes mains de moi.
Maintenant.
Je ne la dérangerais pas tout
de suite, Tom.
Que faites-vous les gars ?
Shawn !
Lâchez-le !
Il est en vie ?
Son pouls est faible.
On va avoir besoin d'une équipe médicale ici,
Tout de suite !
Allez ! Allez !
Vous avez obtenu tout ce dont
nous avons besoin ?
Newfield est une si
charmante petite ville.
Quand tout sera terminé...
Kevin prendra sa retraite,
et nous reviendrons vivre ici.
Ca n'arrivera jamais.
Si les gens commencent à mourir
à cause de la promicine,
ils nous chasseront tous.
Nous partirons.
Je préférerais vraiment que Tess
n'ait pas à forcer ta coopération.
Promettez-moi que tu es avec nous,
et je lui dirai de te laisser partir.
Je ne peux pas.
Je ne suis pas un meurtrier,
Et je ne suis pas près de vous laisser
faire de moi un meurtrier.
Vous pensez que je veux que les gens meurent ?
Pensez-vous honnêtement que ça fasse
partie de mon plan ?
Nous ne l'imposerons à personne.
Les gens seront informés des risques.
C'est tout ce que nous faisons.
Donner aux gens le choix.
Ils ne le prendront jamais.
Combien de tristesse y'a-t-il là-dehors,
Richard ?
Combien de personnes piégées dans des vies
en impasse ?
Ces injections leur donnent une chance
d'accéder à l'extraordinaire.
Il y aura de la demande.
Et à qui voulez-vous donner ces capacités ?
Aux infortunés ?
Aux égarés ?
Ils disent que la modestie
sera de retour sur terre
Je suppose que j'ai juste plus
foi en l'humanité que toi.
Oui, son état est stable,
c'est la bonne nouvelle,
mais il n'a pas repris conscience.
Ils ne savent pas quand il le fera.
<i>Tom, tu es là ?</i>
Oui, oui, je suis là.
Ca ne finira jamais, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui, j'y pense souvent ces derniers jours.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Rien.
Rien. Je ne peux pas t'en parler
maintenant de toute façon.
On se voit bientôt.
Thomas, tu ne peux pas
poursuivre Isabelle.
C'est du suicide.
Je dois le faire.
Elle doit être arrêtée.
Shawn était son fiancé.
Si elle est capable de
le quitter comme ça,
elle est capable de faire
n'importe quoi.
Le futur m'a fait confiance pour l'arrêter,
et ils m'ont donné un moyen de le faire.
Tu ne seras jamais assez près d'elle.
Tu penses qu'elle va te laisser venir
jusqu'à elle et te servir de cette chose ?
Ecoutes, ils ne m'auraient
jamais donné cela
s'ils pensaient que
je n'avais aucune chance.
Tout va bien.
Je dois y aller.
Désolée, je suis en retard.
Je peux m'asseoir ?
Maia, je pensais que tu serais
absente pendant un moment.
Je ne voulais pas prendre de retard.
Je pense que ce serait une mauvaise idée.
Pas vous ?
Euh, certainement.
Nous en sommes à la page 37.
Collier ?
Bonjour, Isabelle.
Ces choses devant lesquelles vous
vous tenez sont à moi.
Cela vient de moi,
et je les reprends.
Cela n'y changera rien.
Vous ne pouvez pas arrêter
ce que j'ai commencé.
Vous savez, vous semblez compter sur l'idée
que je ne peux pas vous faire de mal.
Je ne pense pas que ce soit vrai.
Ce n'est pas bon.
Il n'y a pas de promicine dans ces tubes.
J'ai un message de la part
de Jordan Collier.
C'est un nouveau monde,
et il n'y a pas de place pour vous dedans.
On doit sortir maintenant !
Que s'est-il passé à l'intérieur ?
Rien de tout ça n'était vrai.
Pas de promicine.
Pas de Collier.
Qu'en est-il de mes hommes ?
Ils sont tous morts.
Il pensait pouvoir me tuer.
Il avait tort.
Où vas-tu ?
Où est la promicine ?
Arrête !
Nous devons trouver Collier !
C'est ce que je vais faire.
Je vais le faire parler, le faire venir à moi.
Comment comptes-tu faire cela ?
Je vais au Centre.
Je vais le réduire en cendre,
et tout ceux qui s'y trouvent,
s'il le faut.
Non, tu ne le feras pas.
Tu travailles pour le
gouvernement des Etats-Unis.
Tu n'iras pas là-bas et tuer
des gens comme ça en plein jour.
Chacun de vous recevra un sac.
Dans le sac,
vous trouverez une enveloppe
avec de l'argent pour le voyage
et le nom de votre destination.
Nous n'avons pas beaucoup de temps.
Allez-y.
Ces seringues sont gratuites.
Donnez-les à tous ceux qui voudront,
mais n'oubliez pas d'expliquer les risques.
Ok, venez.
Tout en monde en prend un.
C'est ça.
Et voilà.
Merci pour tout.
Vous êtes sur le point d'affecter le monde
d'une manière que l'on oubliera jamais.
Merci.
Dennis !
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ici ?
Où est-elle ?
Elle est trop puissante.
Je ne peux pas la contrôler.
Personne ne le peut.
Dennis !
Dis-nous juste où elle est partie.
C'est le Centre.
Vous devez me laisser répondre.
Vous êtes bien sur la
ligne de Richard Tyler.
Je suis désolée.
Il n'est pas là pour le moment.
Oh.
Votre fille est au Centre.
Ils pensent qu'elle pourrait
commencer à tuer des gens.
Donc...
Qui veut y aller en premier ?
Des volontaires ?
Ok.
Je vais choisir.
Quel est ton nom ?
Amy.
Amy...
Je vais avoir besoin que
tu restes calme, ok ?
Ca va être rapide.
Tu veux prendre sa place ?
Non.
Je veux juste vous dire quelque chose.
Ce que vous essayez de faire...
ne marchera pas.
Oh, vraiment.
Je suppose que nous verrons.
Tout le monde à terre !
Vous n'aurez pas dû faire ça.
Isabelle !
Quoi ?
Quoi, tu vas me dire d'arrêter ?
Qu'il n'est pas trop tard pour me sauver ?
Il est déjà trop tard.
Tu as fait ton choix,
mais tu es ma fille,
mais si tu arrêtes maintenant,
je te soutiendrais.
Je suis désolé, papa,
mais c'est comme ça que ça doit se finir.
Papa ?
Isabelle...
Isabelle...
Je suis désolé.
Je suis désolé.
J'espère que tu n'as pas fait ça.
Isabelle...
C'est bon.
S'il te plaît...
Qu'est-ce qui m'arrive ?
Mains en l'air !
Ces capacités, elles ont disparu.
Elle est sans défense.
Vas-y.
Finissons-en.
Comment va-t-elle ?
Isabelle sort de chirurgie.
Elle mettra un bon moment à s'en remettre,
mais ils s'attendent à ce qu'elle y arrive.
Tu sais, pendant une minute
J'ai cru que tu allais lui mettre
une balle dans la tête.
Moi aussi.
La blessure à l'épaule était une bonne idée.
Je me demande si oui ou non
les effets de la seringue
seront permanent.
Elle avait commencé à guérir...
J'avais encore neuf balles dans mon chargeur.
Alors, le sont-elles ?
Permanent ?
D'après le Docteur Abapurn,
Ca m'en a l'air.
Il n'y a aucune trace de promicine
dans son système sanguin.
C'est une fille normale.
Une fille normale qui a plein de problèmes.
Ca va, vous deux ?
Bien ...
vous allez devoir vous
requinquez rapidement.
Collier est toujours dans la nature.
Avec sa cachette de promicine.
Le monde est sur le point de changer,
et notre travail vient de devenir plus difficile.
Plus difficile ?
Tu t'en sens capable ?
Pour être honnête...
Je ne crois pas.
Trois jours plus tard.
Assure-toi de m'envoyer des mails et
prends beaucoup de photos.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Je t'assure qu'il y aura plein de photos.
Six mois ça va passer vite.
On se reverra bientôt.
Non.
On reviendra...
mais tu ne seras pas là.
Tu me détestes ?
Non.
Non, c'est juste que...
Je ne sais pas comment je pourrais
faire ce travail sans toi.
Je dois partir, Tom.
Si Collier a raison,
Si basculer dans ce nouveau monde
entraîne encore plus de
bouleversements que maintenant,
Je m'en vais.
Je vais trouver un endroit
Où je peux vivre en paix avec la fille.
Tant que je le peux...
Diana...
Tu n'as pas à justifier ton choix devant moi.
As-tu déjà pensé à la même chose ?
Ouais, bien sûr.
Ce boulot...
Ce combat, ce...
Ca me coûte chère, mais...
J'y suis jusqu'au bout.
J'ai de la chance, hein ?
Au revoir, Tom.
Au revoir.
<i>La fin d'une journée</i>
<i>est toujours le début d'une autre. </i>
<i>Le changement est douloureux et
entraîne toujours un coût</i>
<i>Ca fait mal de devoir payer ses coûts, </i>
<i>mais nous ne pouvons nous
permettre d'abandonner. </i>
<i>Demain est un mystère, </i>
<i>et la seule chose que nous pouvons
faire c'est d'y faire face et de le résoudre. </i>

Jordan !
Jordan...
Ma télé fonctionne.
Ils ont dit qu'il y avait une fille
à El Paso
qui vient de sortir son père
d'un hospice.
Il avait Alzeihmer...
Jusqu'à ce qu'elle passe le voir ce matin.
Viens.
Ils parlent de nous.
Voyons ce qu'il va se passer.
Bonne chance.
Donne-le à tes amis si tu ne
l'utilises pas, mais préviens-les.
Mais, vous savez que vous êtes
sur le point de faire, n'est-ce pas ?
Il n'y a aucune garantie.
Il n'y en a jamais.
Aucune garantie, pour le moment.
Et vous ?
C'est 50-50.
Vous voulez une piqûre ?

over the last 60 years
4400 people have been abducted
all at once they were returned
with no memory of
where they've been
they haven't aged a day
and some have returned
with new abilities
all are trying to reconnect...
...with a life interrupted
<i>We've not a threat.
We're salvation.</i>
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>
you disappeared.
Do you have any idea
where you've been?
Everhere.
You won't feel anything.
I saw the catastrophe,
and i know what we have to do
to stop it.
My life... my future...
it's tied up with the 4400.
<i>[Alana]: kyle's lving.</i>
Kyle,
what are you dng?
I got a job.
I'm going to travel
around the country
for a little while.
You're going to get married.
Did you haen to see
who the lucky guy was?
Maia, this is my friend, ben.
I heard a lot about you,
young lady.
You saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?
Mm-hmm.
Are all these people
4400s?
Some are,
and some just wish thewere.
Good morning.
Welcome to the center.
Are you a 4400?
No, sweetie.
Are you here
to take our seminar?
No, we're here
to look at the school.
Are you sure
you want to do this?
I want to meet
kids like me.
Thomas...
what are you doing?
It's 2:00
in the morning.
Yeah, i couldn't sleep.
Kyle left this stuff
behind.
He wanted me
to throw it out.
I figured i'd...
look through it,
see if he might want
to kp any of it.
You know,
for when he comes home.
Sorry i woke you up.
Are you sure
you want tdo this?
Shawn...
devon asked for this.
She's ready.
Ever since
i first showed up
at the center,
this is what i've wanted.
This is why i came.
Besides,
if anything goes wrong,
you're here, rig?
<i>Um, i'm...</i>
<i>i'm bringing you a message
about a better future.</i>
It's here. Now.
<i>This serum contains promicin.</i>
<i>Everyone knows what that is.</i>
<i>It's the neurotransmitter</i>
<i>that gives the 4400
their abilities.</i>
<i>It's here, now,
within our grasp...</i>
this video went up
the internet
six hours ago.
We have tried to suppress it,
but it keeps showing up
on new servers.
<i>With these shots,</i>
<i>i'm going to train my body
to produce promicin.</i>
Doesn't that woman
work for your nephew?
<i>I am going to develop</i>
<i>a 4400 ability...</i>
<i>and so can you.</i>
An enormous government stockpile
of promicin goes missing,
and a day later,
an employee of the 4400 center
shows up on the internet
collier doesn't care
if we come for him.
Does he really think
people are goi to
inject this
into their bodies, though?
They're definitely curious.
This video's been downloaded
almost 100,000 times already.
By the end of the day,
it'll be 10 times that.
Collier might look
like some kind of prophet now,
but the businessman
inside him
iqn't totally dead.
The man still knows
how to create a market
for his product.
<i>These shots are going to be
available everywre...</i>
<i>soon.</i>
you've been
all through this place,
and i understand you've searched
my other real estate holdings
as well.
Yeah, the ones
we know about.
You haven't found
any pricin,
nor will you.
Your employees
don't seem to have any trouble
finding the stuff.
There's one on the internet
right now,
talking about the start
of a new era.
It's a bold idea.
I wish i'd thought of it.
Devon's
a courageous girl.
She's always aspired
to something higher.
I'm not surprised
she made it happen.
I'd congratulate her...
if i knew where she was.
This isn't just a plan.
It's a revolutio
you realize that,
don't you?
Handing out promicin
like candy
changes everything,
shawn.
Nobody will be able
to enforce the law.
It'll be chaos.
Nobody can predict
what's going to happen
once people everywhere
start developing abilities.
You need to tell us
where he's keeping this stuff.
I don't get you guys.
All along, you've been saying
we're on the same side,
no matter
what our differences are,
that our goals are the same...
for things to change,
get better...
now a man is back from the dead
to show us how to get there,
and you two want to stop him.
You know what?
You can't.
Our phone lines
have been jammed up all morning.
People are dying to know
how they can get their hands
on the shot.
So, what do you
tell them?
I tell them
that we have nothing
to do with it,
and then i wish them good luck.
If he's the voice
of moderation,
we're in a lot
of trouble.
Tom, i need a minute.
There's something
i got to do.
And don't forget
about the decimal point.
You just bring that
above the division...
ms. Skouris. Can i help you?
Yeah, i need
my daughter.
What?
We're going.
<i>... the 4400 their abilities.</i>
<i>With these sts,</i>
<i>i'm going to
train my body</i>
<i>to produce promicin.</i>
<i>I am
going to develop...</i>
denn?
We need to move
against collier now.
<i>These shots
are going to be available...</i>
how are we supposed
to stop the 4400
if we just sit back
and let everyone
have a chance
to become one?
If collier
puts this promicin
out on the street...
he'll be doing our work
for us.
I'm not leaving school.
You can't make me.
I like it there.
I told you,
the center's involved
in some bad stuff,
and you're not
safe there.
I'm not safe anywhere.
At least i was happy there...
but you don't really care
about that,
do you?
Sweetie, i do care,
and we'll work something out.
We'll go back to home-schooling
for a while...
home-schooling sucks.
Excuse me?
We're not finished here,
young lady.
Ben.
I thought you were in london.
Yeah, i didn't go.
This whole "time to think" thing
isn't working for me.
I... needed to see you.
I'm kind of in the middle
of something her-
Guess that can wait.
Come on in.
Is april still here?
No, she left.
Stormed out,
i guess you could say.
But she only took
half her stuff.
Called her a few times,
no luck.
Ha.
I wouldn't call me back either.
Look, i'm sorry
that things are bad
with you guys.
Honestly,
i haven't had much time
to think about it.
Maia's not talking to me.
Everything's blowing up at work.
I have no idea
how all this is going to end.
How about it ends happy?
I have a job offer
in spain.
It's long.
Six months, maybe more.
I'm thinking
of taking it.
You're leaving.
Only if you come with me.
You and maia.
Think about it.
You've given
everything you've had
to this job for years.
It's time to let someone else
pick up the cause.
It'll be better for you.
It'lbe better for maia.
I have thought about leaving.
Just going qomeplace safe.
It just never seemed possie.
But it is.
You have an option
of walking away.
It's important
you remember that.
I've been working
on the video of devon moore
that's making the rounds
on the internet.
I isolated the audio,
played up
the background noise...
that noise you're hearing,
it's a garbage truck,
moving in reverse,
so wherever the tape was made,
there was the garbage truck
doing its rounds outside.
Okay, well, that
narrows it dow
i mean, a little.
But there must be doze
of neighborhoods
scheduled for
garbage collection
last night.
That is true, but...
<i>[ship's whistle blowing]</i>
That sounds like a boat whistle.
A ferry whistle,
to be exact.
So they're near the water.
They're somewhere
between edmonds and woodway.
I checked it out.
Those are the only blocks
near the waterfront
with garbage pickups
scheduled for last night.
I feel kind of weird.
Iq that normal?
Kevin went through
the same thing.
You're lucky, actually.
The promicin
from ryland's company
is pure.
It'll be easier for you.
I wonder what ability i'll get.
I'm sure it'll be great.
Close your eyes, okay?
Rest.
How is she?
She's fine.
I think.
She's tired.
It's hard to believe
it's all starting, isn't it?
Everything we've worked for.
It's not hard for me.
I've believed in you
all along.
There was a reason
we were taken.
A reason they woke you up.
It's incredible.
You should be getting
the nobel prize.
Instead,
we're hiding like criminals.
It won't be like this forever.
Soon we'll be heroes.
Oh, my god!
Call shawn!
Wait... it's all right.
It's all right!
Tess, hurry!
This looks promising.
It's 3516 bay street,
two blocks west of woodway.
Municipal records indicate
it's unoccupied,
but some offshore company
pays the property tax.
Sounds like one of
collier's safe houses.
Look at this.
The utilities have
just been turned on.
Let's go ring the bell,
see who answers.
Kevin!
It's okay.
There's some men
coming up to the house.
They have guns.
We have to go.
Shh... shh...
shawn, we have to go.
No.
Shawn, ntac is right outside!
We have to leave! Now!
No! I am not leaving her!
It's okay. It's okay.
Devon, look at me,
okay?
Just keep looking at me.
Go!
[Shawn]: Devon!
Devon!
Shawn!
Shawn...
step away, shawn.
Keep your hands where everyone
can see them, okay?
I couldn't save her.
It's okay.
She's dead.
It's okay.
Come here. Come here.
How could this happen?
How could devon die?
It makes no sense.
Ryland's giving that stuff
to soldiers
and then parading them around
on national tv.
Well, her body
uldn't handle it.
She died of a massive aneurysm.
Shawn...
you're in a lot
of trouble here,
and the people i work with,
they believe you're involved
in a conspiracy
to distribute promicin,
so you need to talk to us.
What were you doing
at that safe house?
Who called you?
I'm sorry
about what happened to devon,
i am,
but...
i've got nothing to say.
Devon wasn't
the first sacrifice
the future has asked of us.
She won't be the last.
We will honor her memory.
We aan do that later.
Ntac has shawn.
It's only a matter of time
before they get
e location of
this place from him.
Need to destroy this stuff.
Cut and run.
Why?
If they want to come,
let them come.
That's why
you have us here, right?
I admire your bravery.
We may need it.
But not yet.
I tested shawn
to remind him of his loyalties.
He will not betray us.
His loyalties aren't the issue.
We've seen it before.
If the government
wants to know something,
they'll do whatever it takes
to get it.
He will be tested,
yes, richard,
but he'll endure...
long enough for us
to begin distribution.
"Begin distribution"?
Why would you want to do that?
This stuff killed devon.
A dosage problem.
It has to be.
The promicin from your daughter
is different
from what i've been using.
It's too pure.
Richard, look,
we need people
to develop abilities.
If we stop now,
they will paint us as murderers.
If we keep going,
we are murderers.
Jordan, this is over.
I'm ending this.
[Tess]: Mr. Tyler?
I don't think
you should do that.
We're alunder a lot of strain.
Maybe you should just sit down
for a while.
Let's get this
cleaned up.
We need to be ready
to leave.
Sweetie, do you want
to watch a movie?
You can pick.
April.
Hey.
Hey.
I came by to get my stuff.
I packed it up for you.
Oh.
Is that new?
Oh. Yeah.
Little gift myself.
I like it.
Di...
don't pretend, okay?
I did it
to remind myself
who i am.
I guess i wasn't meant
for that whole...
settled thing
i was going for with ben.
I brought you
something.
Oh, you're giving me a present?
Mom's engagement ring.
I gave that
to you, april.
I don't have
any use for it.
Besides,
i kind of owe you.
I mean, don't get me wrong,
i'm still pissed,
but you saved me
from being someone
that i'm not.
Thank you.
Just don't invite me over
for thanksging, okay?
Hey, just one thing.
When maia predicted
that you would end up with ben,
did you really fight against it?
As hard as you told me
that you did?
I thought so.
But to be honest,
now, i...
l-i'm just not so sure.
I'm not at all surprised
that girl died.
That's exactly why
we need to get this stuff
out of
collier's hands.
We need to know
about your promicin
supply, dennis.
Your people have been
working with it for months.
Have you ever seen
anything like this?
We've had some casualties
among the volunteers.
Casualties?
How many?
We recruited 20 men
for the ogram.
Half of them
rejected the promicin
within 48 hours
of their first shot.
"Rejected"?
You mean "died."
We knew there'd be risks, diana.
We explained it
to the volunteers
before they signed on.
Oh, my god.
You knew.
You knew what would happen
when people ok this?
Why didn't you tell us
when it was stolen?
We could have warned collier,
warned the public...
because gods
don't make mistakes.
What better way
to show the people
that collier
is not some sort of messiah
than have him
fall flat on his face in public?
You kept quiet
so you could discredit collier?
A woman is dead, dennis,
and you're just as responsible
as he is!
She shouldn't have been
injecting stolen promicin,
and anybody who
follows her lead
will have to live
with the consequences...
or not.
So this promicin
that collier's holding,
if you take it,
you have a 50% chance
of dying within 48 hours?
Or a 50% chance
of eventually developing
some kind of ability.
We need to hire more agents.
I don't know. 50-50.
Those aren't
very good odds.
For a chance to become
one of the 4400?
I think there's
a lot of people
who'd take them.
How did your nephew
react to the news?
He's still not talking.
He doesn't think
there's any way
collier will move ahead
with the plan.
Tom, we've been working on him
for almost a day.
We need to step up
the interrogation
a couple of notches.
What? No, no, no. No way.
Look, i'm not standing by
while someone tortures shawn.
Actually,
that's not what i had in mind.
You want me to help ntac
interrogate shawn?
I don't think so, thomas.
Alana, i wouldn't have
come to you
if i didn't think
it was a good idea.
It'll be just like
when you helped us
with collier.
You use your
ability on him,
and then, when is over,
you just...
you'd seen
everything he had.
We just need you to tell us
where the promicin is.
I know,
but when i agreed to help ntac,
i told you
i'd never do anything
to hurt the 4400.
You'd be helping shawn.
And if you don't do it,
ntac would consider that
backing out of your deal.
You'd be a fugitive again.
Look, honey...
they're going to get
the information anyway,
and it'll be a whole lot
tougher on shawn.
Hoabout
i call d.c. Myself,
confirm this
so-called "order"?
You do that, nina.
Find out how little authority
you have.
What's he doing here?
The u.s. Military
is taking over
the interrogation
of shawn farrell.
I'm here as a consultant.
We'll be done with shawn
in minutes.
Alana can get all
the information we need,
quickly and painlessly.
You expect us
to trust that woman?
No, we'll take it
from here, tom.
I have confidence
in my interrogator.
Hi, shawn.
We can do this quickly,
you know.
Just tell me
where collier's keeping
the promicin.
No.
I'm curious.
The whole time
we were planning our wedding,
you were working with ryland.
Betraying me...
betraying your father...
why?
It was a balance of power thing.
I was sent
to eliminate the 4400.
I really didn't
want to do that.
I loved you, shawn.
But i had to do something,
so i thought if i joined ryland
and helped his side
learn how to create abilities,
there'd be a standoff.
If everyone
has the technology...
no one can use it.
Did you really think
that was going to work?
Ryland's
going to use those soldiers
baby...
please...
where's the promicin?
Baby...
get your hands
off of me.
Now.
I wouldn't disturb her
right now, tom.
What are you guys
doing?
Shawn!
Let him go!
Is he alive?
His pulse is weak.
We're going to need
a medical team in here,
right now!
Go! Let's go!
Did you get
everything we need?
Newfield is
such a nice little town.
When this is over...
kevin's going to retire,
and we're going to
go back there to live.
That's never going to happen.
If people start dying
from that promicin,
they're going to
hunt us down.
We'll be leaving.
I'd really rather tess
not have to compel
your cooperation.
Give me your word you're aboard,
i'll have her let you go.
I can't do that.
I'm not a murderer,
and i'm not about to let you
make me into one.
Do you think
i want people to die?
Do you honestly believe
that's part of my plan?
We will not rce this
on anyone.
We'll make people aware
of the risks.
That's all we're doing.
Giving people a choice.
They're never going to take it.
How much sadness is out there,
richard?
How many people
trapped in dead-end lives?
These shots give them a chance
at the extraordinary.
There will be a demand.
And that's who you want
to give these abilities to?
The unhappy?
The lost?
They say the meek
shall inherit the earth.
I guess i just have
more faith in humanity
than you.
Yeah, he's stable,
that's the good news,
but he hasn't
regained consciousness.
They don't know when he will.
<i>Tom, are you there?</i>
Yeah, yeah, i'm here.
It never ends, does it?
Yeah, i've been thinking
about that a lot lately.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Nothing i can talk about
right now, anyway.
I'll see you soon.
Thomas, you can't go
up against isabelle.
It's suicide.
I have to do it.
Shhas to be stopped.
Shawn was her fiance.
If she's willing
to leave him like that,
she's willing
to do anything.
The future
trusted me to stop her,
and they gave me
a way to do it.
You'll never
get close enough.
Do you think she'll let you
walk up to her
and use that thing?
Look, they never would have
given me this
if they didn't think
i had a chance.
It's okay.
I have to go.
I'm sorry i'm late.
Is it okay
if i sit down?
Maia, i thought
you were going to be
away from school
for a while.
I didn't want to fall behind.
I think that'd be
a bad idea,
don't you?
Uh, sure.
We're in page 37
of your workbook.
Collier?
Hello, isabelle.
That stuff
you're standing in front of
is mine.
It came from me,
and i'm taking it back.
That won't change anything.
You can't stop what i've begun.
You know, you seem to be
banking on the idea
that i can't hurt you.
I just don't think that's true.
This is no good.
There's no promicin
in the substance at all.
I have a message
from jordan collier.
It's a new world,
and there's no place for you
in it.
We need to get
out of here now!
What happened in there?
It was all fake.
No promicin.
No collier.
What about my men?
They're all dead.
He thought he could kill me.
He was wrong.
Where are you going?
Where the hell
is the promicin?
Stop!
We have to find collier!
That's what i'm going to do.
I'm going to draw him out,
make him come to me.
How do you propose to do that?
I'm going
to the center.
I'm going to bring it down,
and everyone in it,
if i have to.
No, you won't.
You work for
the united states government.
You don't walk in there
and just kill people
in broad daylight.
Each of you
will receive one bag.
Inside the b,
you'll find an envelope
with travel money
and the name
of your destination.
We don't have much time. Go.
These shots are free.
Give them to anyone
who wants them,
but be careful
to explain the risks.
Okay, come on.
Everybody take one.
That's it.
There you go.
Thank you all.
You're about to impact the world
in a way
that will never be forgotten.
Thank you.
Dennis!
What the hell
happened here?
Where is she?
She's too powerful.
I can't control her.
No one can.
Dennis!
Just tell us where she went.
It's the center.
You've got to let me
pick it up.
Richard tyler's line.
I'm sorry.
He's not here
right now.
Oh.
Your daughter's at the center.
They think she might
start killing people.
So...
who wants to go first?
Any volunteers?
Okay.
I'll pick.
What's your name?
Amy.
Amy...
i'm going to need you
to hold still, okay?
This is
going to be quick.
Would you like
to take her place?
No.
I just want
to tell you something.
What you're trying to do...
it's not going to work.
Oh, really.
I guess we'll see about that.
Everybody get down!
You shouldn't have done that.
Isabelle!
What?
What, are you going to
tell me to stop?
That it's still
not too late to save me?
It's past that now.
You made your choice,
but you're my daughter,
and if you quit this now,
i'll stand by you.
I'm sorry, daddy,
but this is the way
it's supposed to be.
Daddy?
Isabelle...
isabelle...
i'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Isabelle...
don't bother.
Please...
what's the matter with me?
[Richard]: Hold on!
Her abilities, they're gone.
The girl's helpless.
Go ahead.
Finish it.
How is she?
Isabelle's out of surgery.
She'll be in recovery
for a good while,
but they expect she'll make it.
You know,
for a minute there,
i thought you were
going to put one
in her head.
So did i.
The shoulder wound
was a good idea.
It let us figure out
whether or not
the effects of that syringe
were permanent.
She had started
to heal herself...
i had nine more bullets
in my clip.
So, were they?
Permanent?
According to dr. Anapurn,
it looks that way.
There's not a trace
of promicin
in her system.
She's just a normal girl.
A normal girl who's
in a lot of trouble.
You both okay?
Good...
because you're going to have
to rest up on the fly.
Collier's still in the wind.
So's his stash
of promicin.
The world's
about to change,
and our jobs just got
a whole lot more difficult.
More difficult?
You up for it?
To be honest...
i don't think so.
Make sure you send me emails
and take lots of pictures.
Don't worry.
I guarantee there'll be
plenty of pictures.
Six months
will go by fast.
We'll see each other soon.
No, we won't.
We'll be back...
but you won't be here.
Do you hate me?
No.
No, it's just...
i don't know how
i'm going to do this job
without you.
I have to leave, tom.
If collier's right,
if moving into
this new world of his
means more upheaval
in the here and now,
i am opting out.
I'm going to
find myself a place
where i can live at peace
with my daughter
as long as i can...
diana...
you don't have to
justify your choice to me.
Do you ever think
about doing the same thing?
Yeah, sure.
This job...
this fight, it's...
It's cost me so much, but...
i'm in it till the end.
Lucky me, huh?
Bye, tom.
Bye.
[Engine turns over]
<i>[Collier]:
The end of one journey</i>

[Kevin]: Jordan!
Jordan...
i got the tv working.
They're saying
there's a woman in el paso
who just checked
her father
out of a hoqpice.
He had alzheimer's...
until she visited him
this morning.
Come on.
They're talking
about us.
Let's go watch it happen.
Good luck.
Give it to a friend
if you don't use it,
but give them the warning.
Now, you understand
what you're about
to do, right?
There are no guarantees.
There never are.
No guarantees, now.
How about you?
It's 50-50.
You want the shot?
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to www.1000fr.com</font>
We're not a threat, We're salvation,
The world will have to deal with us.
Previously on The 4400:
You disappeared.
Any idea where you've been?
- Everywhere.
- You won't feel anything, I promise.
I saw the catastrophe and I know
what we have to do to stop it.
My life, my future,
it's tied up with the 4400.
- Kyle's leaving,
- Kyle, what are you doing?
Got a job. I'm gonna travel
around the country for a while.
- You're gonna get married.
- You happen to see who the guy was?
Maia, this is my friend, Ben.
I heard a lot about you, young lady.
You saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?
Are all these people 4400s?
Well, some are
and some just wish they were.
Good morning.
Welcome to the Center.
Are you a 4400?
No, sweetie.
You here to take our seminar?
No. We're here to look at the school.
You sure you wanna do this?
I wanna meet kids like me.
Thomas.
What are you doing?
It's 2:00 in the morning.
I couldn't sleep.
Kyle left his stuff behind.
He wanted me to throw it out.
I figured I'd look through it,
see if you might wanna keep any of it
you know, for when he comes home.
Sorry I woke you up.
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Shawn.
Devon asked for this. She's ready.
Ever since I first showed up
at the Center, this is what I've wanted.
This is why I came.
Besides, if anything goes wrong,
you're here, right?
I'm bringing you a message
about a better future,
It's here. Now.
This serum contains promicin,
Everyone knoWs What that is,
It's the neurotransmitter
that gives the 4400 their abilities,
It's here, NoW,,,
This video went up on the lnternet
six hours ago.
We've tried to suppress it,
but it keeps showing up
on new servers.
With these shots, I'm going to train
my body to produce promicin,
Doesn't that woman work
for your nephew?
I am going to develop a 4400 ability,
And so can you,
An enormous government stockpile
of promicin goes missing
and a day later, an employee
of the 4400 Center shows up
on the lnternet giving herself a shot?
Collier doesn't care if we come for him.
- He thinks people will inject this?
- Oh, they are definitely curious.
This video's been downloaded almost
a hundred thousand times already.
By the end of the day,
it'll be up to 1 0 times that.
Collier may look like some kind
of prophet now,
but the businessman inside him
isn't totally dead.
The man still knows how to create
a market for his product.
These shots are going
to be available everywhere, Soon,
You've been all through this place
and I understand you searched
my other real estate holdings as well.
Yeah, the ones we know about.
You haven't found any promicin,
nor will you.
Your employees don't seem
to have any trouble finding the stuff.
There's one on the lnternet right now
talking about the start of a new era.
It's a bold idea.
I wish I'd thought of it.
Devon is a courageous girl.
She's always aspired
to something higher.
I'm not surprised
she made it happen.
I'd congratulate her.
If I knew where she was.
This isn't just a plan.
It's a revolution.
You realize that, don't you?
Handing out promicin like candy
changes everything, Shawn.
Nobody will be able to enforce the law.
It will be chaos.
Nobody can predict
what's gonna happen
once people everywhere
start developing abilities.
You need to tell us
where he's keeping that stuff.
I don't get you guys.
All along, you've been saying
we're on the same side
no matter what our differences are,
that our goals are the same,
for things to change, get better.
Now a man is back from the dead
to show us how to get there
and you two wanna stop him.
You know what? You can't.
Our phone lines have been jammed up
all morning.
People are dying to know how
they can get their hands on the shot.
So, what do you tell them?
I tell them
that we have nothing to do with it
and then I wish them good luck.
If he's the voice of moderation,
we're in a lot of trouble.
Tom, I need a minute.
There's something I've gotta do.
And don't forget
about the decimal point.
You just bring that above the divi--
Ms. Skouris, can I help you?
Yeah, I need my daughter.
We're going.
--4400 their abilities,
With these shots, I'm going to train
my body to produce promicin,
- I am going to develop a 4400 ability,
- Dennis.
We need to move against Collier now.
These shots are going
to be available,,,
How are we supposed to stop the 4400
if we just sit back
and let everyone have a chance
to become one?
If Collier puts this promicin
out on the street,
he'll be doing our work for us.
I'm not leaving school.
You can't make me. I like it there.
Sweetie, I told you the Center
is involved in some bad stuff
and you're not safe there.
I'm not safe anywhere.
At least I was happy there.
But you don't really care about that,
do you?
Sweetie, I do care
and we'll work something out.
We'll go back to home schooling
for a while.
Home schooling sucks.
Excuse me?
We're not finished here, young lady.
Ben?
I thought you were in London.
Yeah, I didn't go.
This whole "time to think" thing
isn't working for me.
I needed to see you.
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.
I guess that can wait. Come on in.
Is April still here?
No. She left.
Stormed out, I guess you could say,
but she only took half her stuff.
Called her a few times. No luck.
I wouldn't call me back either.
Look, I'm sorry that things are bad
with you guys.
Honestly, I haven't had much time
to think about it.
Maia's not talking to me,
everything's blowing up at work.
I have no idea
how all this is gonna end.
How about it ends happy?
I have a job offer in Spain.
It's long. Six months, maybe more.
I'm thinking of taking it.
- You're leaving.
- Only if you come with me.
You and Maia.
Look, think about it.
You've given everything you've had
to this job for years.
It's time to let someone else
pick up the cause.
Better for you.
Be better for Maia.
I have thought about leaving.
Just going someplace safe.
Just never seemed possible.
But it is.
You have an option of walking away.
It's important you remember that.
I've been working
on the video of Devon Woods
making the rounds on the lnternet,
isolated the audio,
played up the background noise.
That noise you're hearing?
It's a garbage truck moving in reverse.
So wherever the tape was made,
there was the garbage truck
doing its rounds outside.
Okay, well, that narrows it down,
I mean, a little,
but there must be dozens
of neighborhoods scheduled
for garbage collection
last night.
That is true, but...
Sound like a boat whistle.
Ferry whistle, to be exact.
So they're near the water.
They're somewhere
between Edmonds and Woodway.
I checked it out.
Those are the only blocks
near the waterfront
with garbage pickup scheduled
for last night.
I feel kind of weird.
Is that normal?
Kevin went through the same thing.
You're lucky, actually.
The promicin from Ryland's company
is pure.
It'll be easier for you.
I wonder what ability I'll get.
I'm sure it'll be great.
Close your eyes, okay?
Rest.
How is she?
She's fine.
I think.
She's tired.
It's hard to believe it's all starting,
isn't it?
Everything we've worked for.
It's not hard for me.
I've believed in you all along.
There's a reason we were taken,
a reason they woke you up.
That's incredible.
You should be getting
the Nobel Prize.
Instead, we are hiding like criminals.
It won't be like this forever.
Soon we'll be heroes.
Oh, my God! Kevin.
Call Shawn.
Wait, it's all right.
It's all right.
Tess, hurry.
This looks promising.
It's 351 6 Bay Street,
two blocks west of Woodway.
The municipal records indicate
it's unoccupied,
but some offshore company
pays the property tax.
Sounds like one
of Collier's safe houses.
Look at this.
The utilities have just been turned on.
Let's go ring the bell,
see who answers.
It's okay. It's okay.
- Kevin.
- It's okay.
There are some men coming up
to the house. They have guns.
We have to go.
- Shawn, we have to go.
- No.
Shawn, NTAC is right outside.
We have to leave now.
No, I am not leaving her.
It's okay. It's okay.
Devon? Devon, you just look at me,
okay, just keep looking.
Go.
Devon.
Devon.
Shawn. Shawn. Step away, Shawn.
Keep your hands
where everyone can see them, okay?
I couldn't save her.
It's okay.
Come here. Come on.
She's dead.
It's okay.
Come here. Come on.
It's okay.
How could this happen?
How could Devon die?
It makes no sense.
Ryland's giving that stuff to soldiers
and then parading them around
on national TV.
Well, her body couldn't handle it.
- She died of a massive aneurysm.
- Shawn, you're in a lot of trouble here.
And the people I work with,
they believe you're involved
in a conspiracy to distribute promicin.
So you need to talk to us.
What were you doing
at that safe house?
Who called you?
I'm sorry about what happened
to Devon.
I am, but... Got nothing to say.
Devon wasn't the first sacrifice
the future has asked of us.
She won't be the last.
We will honor her memory.
We can do that later.
NTAC has Shawn.
It's only a matter of time
before they get the location from him.
We need to destroy this stuff.
Cut and run.
Why? If they wanna come,
let them come.
That's why you have us here, right?
I admire your bravery.
We may need it.
But not yet.
I tested Shawn to remind him
of his loyalties.
- He will not betray us.
- His loyalties aren't the issue.
We've seen it before.
The government wants something,
they'll do whatever to get it.
He will be tested. Yes, Richard.
But he'll endure.
Long enough for us
to begin distribution.
Begin distribution?
Why would you wanna do that?
This killed Devon.
Dosage problem.
It has to be.
The promicin from your daughter
is different from what I've been using.
It's too pure.
Richard, look,
we need people to develop abilities.
If we stop now,
they will paint us as murderers.
If we keep going, we are murderers.
Jordan, this is over.
I'm ending this.
Mr. Tyler?
I don't think you should do that.
We are all under a lot of strain.
Maybe you should just sit down
for a while.
Let's get this cleaned up.
We need to be ready to leave.
Sweetie, do you wanna watch
a movie? You can pick.
April.
Hey.
Hey.
I came by to get my stuff.
I packed it up for you.
Is that new?
Yeah. A little gift to myself.
I like it.
Di, don't pretend, okay?
I did it to remind myself who I am.
I guess I wasn't meant
for that whole...
..."settled" thing
I was going for with Ben.
I brought you something.
Are you giving me a present?
Mom's engagement ring.
I gave that to you, April.
I don't have any use for it.
Besides, I kind of owe you.
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm still pissed,
but you saved me
from being someone that I'm not.
Thank you.
Just don't invite me over
for Thanksgiving, okay?
Hey, just one thing.
When Maia predicted
that you would end up with Ben,
did you really fight against it?
As hard as you told me that you did?
I thought so--
But to be honest, now l...
Oh, I'm just not so sure.
I'm not at all surprised that girl died.
It's exactly why we need
to get this stuff out of Collier's hands.
We need to know
about your promicin supply, Dennis.
Your people have been working with it.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
We've had some casualties
among the volunteers.
Casualties?
How many?
We recruited 20 men for the program.
Half of them rejected the promicin
within 48 hours of their first shot.
Rejected? You mean, died?
We knew there would be risks, Diana.
We explained it to the volunteers
before they signed on.
Oh, my God. You knew.
You knew what would happen
when people took this.
Why didn't you tell us
when it was stolen?
We could have warned Collier,
warned the public--
Because gods don't make mistakes.
What better way to show the people
that Collier is not some sort
of messiah,
than have him
fall flat on his face in public?
You kept quiet
so you could discredit Collier?
A woman is dead, Dennis.
And you're just as responsible
as he is.
She shouldn't have been
injecting stolen promicin.
And anybody who follows her lead
will have to live
with the consequences.
Or not.
So this promicin
that Collier's holding, if you take it,
you have a 50 percent chance
of dying within 48 hours?
Or a 50 percent chance of eventually
developing some kind of ability.
We need to hire more agents.
I don't know. Fifty-fifty.
Those aren't very good odds.
For a chance
to become one of the 4400,
I think there's a lot of people
who'd take them.
Yeah.
How did your nephew react
to the news?
He's still not talking.
He doesn't think there's any way
Collier will move ahead with the plan.
Tom, we've been working on him
for almost a day.
We need to step up the interrogation
a couple notches.
No, no, no. No way.
Look, I'm not standing by
while someone tortures Shawn.
Actually, that's not
what I had in mind.
You want me to help NTAC
interrogate Shawn?
I don't think so, Thomas.
Alana, I wouldn't have come here
if I didn't think it was a good idea.
It'll be just like
when you helped us with Collier.
You use your ability on him
and then when it's over, you just...
You'd have seen everything he had.
We just need you to tell us
where the promicin is.
I know.
But when I agreed to help NTAC,
I told you I'd never do anything
to hurt the 4400.
You'd be helping Shawn.
And if you don't do it,
NTAC will consider that
backing out of your deal.
You'd be a fugitive again.
Look, honey,
they are gonna get
the information anyway
and it will be a whole lot tougher
on Shawn.
How about I call D.C. myself?
Confirm this so-called order?
You do that, Nina.
You'll find out
how little authority you have.
What's he doing here?
The U.S. military has taken over
the interrogation of Shawn Farrell.
- I'm here as a consultant.
- We'll be done with Shawn in minutes.
Alana can get
all the information we need.
Quickly and painlessly.
Do you expect us
to trust that woman?
No, we'll take it from here, Tom.
I have confidence in my interrogator.
Hi, Shawn.
We can do this quickly, you know.
Just tell me
where Collier is keeping the promicin.
No.
I'm curious.
The whole time we were planning
our wedding,
you were working with Ryland.
Betraying me.
Betraying your father.
Why?
It was a "balance of power" thing.
I was sent to eliminate the 4400.
I really didn't want to do that.
I loved you, Shawn.
But I had to do something.
So I thought, if I joined Ryland
and helped his side learn
how to create abilities,
there would be a standoff.
If everyone has the technology,
no one can use it.
Did you really think
that was gonna work?
Ryland's gonna use those soldiers
to kill us all.
Not if I don't let him.
But whatever I have to do
to keep Collier
from going through with his plan,
I'll do it.
Baby...
Please.
Where is the promicin?
Baby...
Get your hands off of me.
Now.
- I wouldn't disturb her right now, Tom.
- Don't touch that.
- Let go.
- Keep him out of there.
- What are you guys doing?
- Hold it.
Shawn.
Let him go.
Is he alive?
His pulse is weak.
We're gonna need a medical team
in here right now.
Go. Let's go.
Did you get everything we need?
Newfield is such a nice little town.
When this is over,
Kevin's gonna retire and we're gonna
go back there to live.
That's never gonna happen.
People start dying
from that promicin,
they're gonna hunt us down.
We'll be leaving.
I'd rather Tess not have to compel
your cooperation.
Give me your word you are aboard,
I'll have her let you go.
I can't do that.
I'm not a murderer and I'm not about
to let you make me into one.
Do you think I want people to die?
You honestly believe
that is part of my plan?
We will not force this on anyone.
We'll make people
aware of the risks.
That's all we're doing.
Giving people a choice.
They're never gonna take it.
How much sadness is out there?
How many people trapped
in dead-end lives?
These shots give them a chance
at the extraordinary.
There will be a demand.
And that's who you wanna give
these abilities to?
The unhappy? The lost?
They say the meek shall inherit
the earth.
I guess I just have more faith
in humanity than you.
Yeah, he's stable,
that's the good news,
but he hasn't regained
consciousness.
They don't know when he will.
Tom, are you there?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
Never ends, does it?
Yeah, I've been thinking about that
a lot lately.
What do you mean?
Nothing. Nothing I can talk about
right now anyway.
I'll see you soon.
Thomas?
Thomas, you can't go up
against lsabelle.
- It's suicide.
- I have to do it.
She has to be stopped.
Shawn was her fiancé.
If she's willing to leave him like that,
she's willing to do anything.
The future trusted me to stop her
and they gave me a way to do it.
You'll never get close enough.
Do you think she'd let you walk up
to her and use that?
Look, they never would have
given me this
if they didn't think I had a chance.
It's okay. I have to go.
Okay.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Is it okay if I sit down?
I thought you were gonna be away
from school for a while.
I didn't want to fall behind.
I think that would be a bad idea.
Don't you?
Sure. We're in page 37
of your workbook.
Collier.
Hello, lsabelle.
That stuff you're standing in front of
is mine.
It came from me
and I'm taking it back.
That won't change anything.
You can't stop what I've begun.
You know, you seem to be banking
on the idea that I can't hurt you.
I just don't think that's true.
This is no good.
There's no promicin
in this substance at all.
I have a message from Jordan Collier.
It's a new world,
and there's no place for you in it.
We need to get out of here now.
Go.
Go. Go. Go.
What happened in there?
It was all fake.
No promicin. No Collier.
What about my men?
They're all dead.
He thought he could kill me.
He was wrong.
Where are you going?
Where the hell is the promicin?
Stop. We have to find Collier.
That's what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna draw him out,
make him come to me.
How do you propose to do that?
I'm going to the Center.
I'm gonna bring it down
- and everyone in it if I have to.
- No, you won't.
You work
for the United States Government.
You don't walk in there
and just kill people in broad daylight.
Each of you will receive one bag.
Inside the bag you'll find an envelope
with travel money
and the name of your destination.
We don't have much time.
Go. These shots are free.
Give them to anyone
who wants them.
But be careful to explain the risks.
Okay, come on.
Now everybody take one.
That's it.
Thank you all.
You're about to impact the world
in a way that will never be forgotten.
- Jordan, thank you for all you've done.
- Thank you.
Dennis.
What the hell happened here?
Where is she?
She's too powerful.
I can't control her.
No one can.
Dennis, just tell us where she went.
The Center.
You gotta let me pick it up.
Richard Tyler's line.
I'm sorry. He's not here right now.
Your daughter is at the Center.
They think
she might start killing people.
So...
Who wants to go first?
Any volunteers?
Okay.
I'll pick.
What's your name?
Amy.
Amy.
I'm gonna need you to hold still, okay?
This is gonna be quick.
Would you like to take her place?
No.
I just want to tell you something.
What you're trying to do,
it's not gonna work.
Oh, really?
I guess we'll see about that.
- Everybody get down.
- Get out. Go.
Get out. Out. Out.
You shouldn't have done that.
No.
Isabelle.
What?
What? You're gonna tell me to stop?
That it's still not too late to save me?
It's past that now.
You made your choice,
but you're my daughter
and if you quit this now,
I'll stand by you.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
But this is the way
it's supposed to be.
Daddy?
Isabelle.
Isabelle.
Isabelle, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Isabelle.
- Don't bother.
- Please.
What's the matter with me?
Hold on.
Her abilities. They're gone.
The girl's helpless.
Go ahead.
Finish it.
How is she?
Isabelle is out of surgery.
She'll be in recovery for a good while,
but they expect she'll make it.
Well, for a minute there, I thought
you were gonna put one in her head.
So did l.
The shoulder wound was
a good idea.
Let us figure out whether the effects
of that syringe were permanent.
If she had started to heal herself--
I had nine more bullets in my clip.
So were they?
Permanent?
According to Dr. Anapurn,
it looks that way.
There's not a trace of promicin
in her system.
She's just a normal girl.
A normal girl
who's in a lot of trouble.
Are you both okay?
Good, because you're gonna have
to rest up on the fly.
Collier is still in the wind.
So is his stash of promicin.
The world is about to change
and our jobs just got
a whole lot more difficult.
More difficult. You up for it?
To be honest,
I don't think so.
Make sure you send me e-mails
and take lots of pictures.
Well, don't worry. I guarantee
there will be plenty of pictures.
Six months will go by fast.
We'll see each other soon.
No, we won't.
We'll be back,
but you won't be here.
Do you hate me?
No.
No, it's just--
I don't know how I'm gonna do
this job without you.
I have to leave, Tom.
If Collier is right,
if moving into this new world of his
means more upheaval
in the here and now,
I am opting out.
I'm gonna find myself a place
where I can live at peace
with my daughter as long as I can.
Diana.
You don't have to justify
your choice to me.
You ever think about
doing the same thing?
Yeah, sure.
Look, this job, this fight, it's...
It's cost me so much, but...
I'm in it till the end.
Lucky me, huh?
Bye, Tom.
Bye.
The end of one journey
is alWays the beginning of another,
So...
Change is painful
and alWays comes With a cost,
It hurts to bear those costs,
but We can't alloW that to sWay us,
TomorroW is a mystery,
The only thing We can do
is face it With resolve,
We move forward,
alWays forward and into What's next,
We make a choice,
We act on that choice,
And all that's left is to live in hope,
Jordan. Jordan,
I got the TV working.
They're saying
there's a woman in El Paso
who just checked her father
out of a hospice.
He had Alzheimer's
until she visited him this morning.
Come on. They're talking about us.
Let's go watch it happen.
Now, good luck.
Give it to a friend if you don't use it,
but give them the warning.
Now you understand
what you're about to do, right?
There are no guarantees.
There never are.
No guarantees now.
How about you?
It's fifty-fifty.
You want the shot?

4400 disparus
4400 sont revenus
Tous possèdent une aptitude unique
L'un d'entre eux porte un message
Quiconque peut devenir exceptionnel
Le risque est immense
À la hauteur des bienfaits
C'est irréversible
Le monde devra nous accepter.
<i>Précédemment dans</i> Les 4400...
Ces doses sont gratuites.
Distribuez-les à qui veut,
mais expliquez-leur bien
les risques.
Distribuer la promicine
comme des bonbons est dangereux.
Personne ne peut prévoir
ce qui se passera
quand n'importe qui
développera des capacités.
Comment vas-tu, sœurette ?
<i>April Skouris,
le vilain petit canard de la famille.</i>
Tu ne sais pas
qui elle est réellement.
Pendant les préparations
du mariage,
tu m'as trahi en travaillant
avec Ryland...
- Où est la promicine ?
- Écarte-toi de moi.
Son état est stable,
bonne nouvelle.
Mais ils ne savent pas
quand il reprendra connaissance.
On m'a proposé un boulot en Espagne.
Si tu viens avec moi...
Si Collier a raison,
si l'évolution vers ce nouveau monde
remet en cause
tout ce que l'on connaît,
je vais chercher un endroit
où je pourrais vivre
en paix avec ma fille
autant que possible.
La photo d'Alana est dans chaque hôpital
et commissariat du pays.
Personne ne l'a vue, Tom.
Je suis désolé.
Tu es prêt ?
Viens, ça va bientôt commencer.
Tu crois que je raterais ça ?
Je suis autant excité que toi, papa.
Bien, allons-y, alors.
Je vous ai gardé des places.
Désolé.
- Salut, Tom.
- Salut, Maia.
- Tu es ravissante.
- Merci.
Tu m'avais dit que tu serais en retard,
alors, j'ai interrompu la cérémonie.
Salut, les gars.
- Ça va ?
- Bien, et toi ?
Salut, Tess.
Ma chérie.
C'est bon de te revoir.
- Kevin...
- Tu vas bien ?
Je me demandais
si tu allais arriver.
En fait, on m'a un peu aidé.
Merci.
Merci pour vos applaudissements,
même s'ils ne me sont pas
réellement destinés.
Nous sommes rassemblés
pour remercier un homme,
un homme qui s'est occupé
d'un monde sombre et dangereux,
et qui l'a guéri.
Un homme qui a éradiqué
la maladie et la guerre,
et qui a changé notre vision
de la condition humaine.
Il a rendu les capacités des 4400
accessibles à tous,
et nos vies s'en sont améliorées.
Certains l'appellent Le Sauveur,
d'autres Le Messie.
Il est tout cela, et bien plus.
Mesdames, Messieurs, M. Jordan Collier.
Aujourd'hui,
ce matin,
ici comme partout ailleurs,
c'est bon de se sentir vivant !
Unis, plus que l'humanité
ne l'a jamais été.
Grâce à la promicine,
dont je vous ai fait cadeau,
et que vous... avez acceptée.
Ensemble, nous avons créé
le Paradis sur Terre,
une époque heureuse,
de joie infinie,
que nous partageons tous.
Et pour cela,
inclinons-nous
en signe de remerciement.
C'est rien.
Ce n'était qu'un rêve.
Vous rêviez... encore.
C'était quoi, cette fois ?
J'ai distribué la promicine.
J'ai évité la catastrophe.
C'est ce qu'il fallait faire.
Nous avons sauvé le monde de...
Je sais...
de quoi nous avons sauvé le monde.
Mais le monde que j'ai créé
est-il meilleur ?

San Sebatian, Espagne
Encore, s'il te plaît.
C'est vraiment dégoûtant.
Vous aviez promis
de ne plus faire ça devant moi.
C'est vulgaire.
Ce n'est pas dégoûtant,
c'est... de l'amour.
Un jour, tu comprendras.
Alors, maman,
quand vas-tu nous en parler ?
Parler de quoi ?
Maman a décroché ce boulot.
Ce boulot pour l'Union Européenne ?
Elle les conseillera
sur tout ce qui touche aux 4400.
Ils disent qu'on pourra vivre
où on veut en Europe.
Il y a plein d'avantages incroyables.
Il te manque quelque chose
dans ce boulot ?
Une arme...
ce qui le rend absolument parfait.
Si j'accepte,
ça signifie que
les vacances sont terminées.
On va devoir
s'installer quelque part.
Alors, qu'en dites-vous ?
Vous êtes prêts
à vous poser pour de bon ?
- Salut, papa.
- Quand es-tu revenu en ville ?
- Pourquoi tu ne m'as pas appelé ?
- Franchement ?
Après mon départ, j'étais pas certain
que tu veuilles me revoir.
Tu as dit que tu voulais t'éloigner.
Je voulais respecter ton choix.
Mais tu aurais dû te douter que...
j'étais prêt à te parler
n'importe quand.
J'ai un nouveau boulot, demain.
Aide juridique pour les 4400.
Je voulais coucher à l'hôtel
pendant que je cherche un appart',
mais ça m'a semblé un peu stupide
vu que tu es là, tout seul.
Toujours pas de nouvelles d'Alana ?
Un peu de compagnie
me fera du bien.
Je suis désolé
qu'elle soit partie, papa.
Je l'aimais vraiment bien.
Et elle t'aimait.
Je sais.
J'ai toujours espoir
qu'un jour en rentrant
je la retrouverai ici.
Je vais défaire mon sac, OK ?
Après, je voudrais aller voir Shawn.
Bienvenue à la maison.
Merci.
<i>La bonne nouvelle,
c'est que je ne suis pas mort.</i>
<i>J'ai pris la dose il y a 3 jours,
et je suis toujours là.</i>
<i>La mauvaise nouvelle ?</i>
<i>Je peux rien casser
juste en y pensant,</i>
<i>ni voler,</i>
<i>ni rien faire de particulier.</i>
<i>Je suis toujours moi-même.</i>
<i>Graham... alias Personne.</i>
Bon, alors...
j'aimerais bien aller
à la soirée avec Jeff.
Amber !
<i>Crétin de geek.</i>
Allez les gars, rassemblez-vous.
On va faire les équipes.
Bougez-vous !
Mettez-vous en rang.
Magne-toi, Mike !
T'es toujours à la bourre, allez !
Je vais choisir...
Graham.
Je veux Graham.
Moi ?
Minute.
- Non, moi je prends Graham.
- Les gars...
arrêtez de vous foutre de moi.
Tout le monde sait
que je sais pas jouer.
Écoutez.
Graham n'a pas envie
de jouer au basket,
donc pas de basket
pour aujourd'hui.
Alors, Graham ?
Tu veux jouer à quoi ?
Vous êtes sérieux ?
Oui.
On joue à ce que tu veux.
Dis-nous.
- Un combat de pouce ?
- C'est parti...
combat de pouce.
Mettez-vous par deux !
Vous deux, là-bas.
Allez, on se bouge !
Vous deux, là.
Mike, toi et Billy ici.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je te présente
la nouvelle directrice du NTAC.
Je comprends pas.
Elle n'a jamais fait partie
des forces de l'ordre.
Elle a fait partie
d'un groupe de réflexion
et elle reçoit un insigne et une arme
pour jouer au shérif ?
Elle a géré l'afflux de réfugiés
après les ouragans au Texas,
- et s'en est bien tirée.
- C'est une nomination politique.
Elle a souri à la bonne personne
à une réception,
donc ils ont fait l'impasse
sur les gens qualifiés.
Et Tom...
elle a demandé à te voir
dès ton arrivée.
- Bonjour.
- Tom Baldwin.
Je suis au courant.
Meghan Doyle.
Est-ce qu'il vous semble droit ?
Oui. C'est...
C'est parfait.
Amatrice de sous-titres.
Vous avez déjà vu
<i>La Dolce Vita</i> ?
Franchement ? Non.
J'ai la nette impression que
je suis la seule ici à l'avoir vu,
mais c'est pas grave.
Ceci dit, vous devriez le voir.
D'accord.
Détendez-vous, Tom.
C'est pas obligé.
Je vous en prie, asseyez-vous.
Je veux vous montrer quelque chose.
Pour qu'on parte
sur de bonnes bases.
Ouvrez.
C'est intéressant.
- C'est classé confidentiel.
- Je sais...
mais j'ai lu votre dossier.
Ce n'est pas ce genre de détail
qui vous fait reculer.
Allez-y.
Motus et bouche cousue.
C'est au sujet d'Isabelle Tyler.
Pourquoi me le montrer ?
On peut lui rendre visite, maintenant.
Je me suis dit
que vous voudriez la voir.
Ça fait 3 mois
que vous recherchez Alana Mareva.
Et vous n'avez abouti à rien.
Vous avez dû envisager la possibilité
d'un second enlèvement.
Oui, personne ne disparaît
comme ça du jour au lendemain.
Isabelle Tyler est la seule personne
ayant un lien avec le futur.
S'ils ont bien enlevé Alana,
Isabelle pourra peut-être
vous apprendre quelque chose.
Ça ne va pas vous attirer d'ennuis ?
C'est votre 1er jour.
Ça m'ennuierait.
Si j'attrape Jordan Collier,
enfreindre quelques règles
ne gênera personne,
mais si je ne l'attrape pas,
obéir aux ordres ne me sauvera pas.
J'apprécie. Merci.
Ces affiches.
Si on aime les films étrangers,
on pense que vous êtes
une intellectuelle ou une extrémiste.
À vrai dire,
j'aime les films, c'est tout.
Vous les aimez pas plutôt
car ils mettent les gens mal à l'aise ?
Il doit y avoir de ça, aussi.
Salut, mec.
Tu m'entends ?
Quand j'étais dans le coma,
mon père me parlait
à longueur de journée.
Je ne m'en rappelle pas, mais...
Va savoir ?
Ça m'a peut-être aidé.
Si seulement je pouvais t'aider.
J'ai essayé.
J'ai pris une dose,
il y a trois mois.
Je flippais,
mais je l'ai fait quand même.
Je pensais
que je pourrais te réveiller.
Comme tu l'as fait pour moi.
Clou de l'histoire ? Rien.
Trois mois et aucune capacité.
Rien de rien.
Rien n'a changé.
Bizarre, hein ?
J'ai essayé.
Je suis désolé.
Excusez-moi.
Vous êtes perdue ?
Au secours.
Aide-moi.
<i>Partout où je vais,
il y a des morts.</i>
Ils me détestent.
Ils sont morts à cause de moi.
À cause de nous.
Tess, on leur a laissé le choix.
On n'a forcé personne
à prendre les doses.
Prends tes médicaments.
D'accord ?
Tu te sentiras mieux, après.
Allez, prends-les.
Quand elle aura pris ses médicaments,
elle se calmera.
C'est ça, votre opinion médicale ?
Tess est schizophrène.
Le stress de se tenir caché,
le sentiment de culpabilité,
elle le supporte pas.
Ce qui a causé sa crise !
Elle a besoin de soins médicaux mieux
que ceux que nous lui fournissons.
Tant que j'aurai pas trouvé
de docteur sympathisant,
vous devrez lui administrer
ses médicaments vous-même.
Rappellez-vous,
que c'est grâce à Tess...
que vous êtes en sécurité.
Sans elle, on vous aurait arrêté
depuis longtemps.
Et je vous assure,
je me fous
que le sort du monde soit en jeu.
Je ne sacrifierai pas Tess pour vous.
Ou pour votre cause.
Pour notre cause, Kevin.
La nôtre.
<i>GRAHAM CHÉRI,
JE SUIS SORTIE</i>
<i>VOILÀ 20 $ POUR MANGER.
BISOU MAMAN.</i>
Salut, les gars.
- Quoi de neuf ?
- On a parlé,
et on voulait que tu saches...
qu'on est tous avec toi.
Nous croyons.
- En quoi ?
- En toi.
On n’est pas les seuls.
On a amené quelqu'un.
J'y crois pas.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je suis venue
pour être auprès de toi.
Qu'est-ce que...
Amber, attends.
Tu sais les injections
dont tout le monde parle à la télé ?
J'en ai pris.
Je crois que c'est ça
qui vous fait agir bizarrement.
Non, Graham, c'est toi.
On veut être à tes côtés.
On veut être
aux côtés de la lueur.
- Quelle lueur ?
- Celle que tu dégages.
Je ne l'avais pas remarquée avant,
mais aujourd'hui, je la vois.
Elle est magnifique.
Tu es magnifique.
T'es certaine de vouloir le faire ?
Ils t'ont dit de me tuer.
Mais tu ne l'as pas fait.
Tu ne t'es jamais dit que
c'est pour ça qu'elle a disparu ?
C'est ton châtiment.
C'est ce que tu crois
ou ce que tu sais ?
Comment va Shawn ?
Du nouveau ?
Il est dans un centre hospitalier.
Soins de longue durée.
Et mon père,
quelqu'un a de ses nouvelles ?
Non, il est sur la liste
et on le trouvera.
Si tu sais quoi que ce soit
sur Alana, dis-le-moi, je t'en prie.
Dis-moi, je t'en prie !
Tu veux garder espoir,
n'est-ce pas ?
Tu veux croire qu'elle va revenir.
Bien sûr.
Alors, tu ne veux pas savoir.
Je suis désolée, Tom, vraiment,
mais ils se sont servis de toi.
Tout comme ils se sont servis de moi.
<i>Salut, Diana.</i>
C'est moi. Marco.
<i>Tu t'amuses bien en Espagne ?</i>
Salut Marco !
Oui, tout va bien.
Et toi, ça va ?
Oui. Je vais bien.
En fait, il est arrivé un truc.
<i>Il y a quelques jours,
des agents ont fouillé un appartement.</i>
<i>Il y avait pas mal de promicine.</i>
Un des gars qu'ils ont arrêté
a donné pas mal de noms.
Des gens qui ont reçu des seringues.
Que veux-tu me dire, Marco ?
L'un des noms était April Skouris.
Ma soeur a pris des doses ?
<i>Le mec n'a pas su dire
si elle en avait pris,</i>
<i>mais elle en avait,
sans aucun doute.</i>
<i>Tu as de ses nouvelles ?</i>
Non... pas depuis des mois.
Elle ne m'a pas appelé pour
mon anniversaire. Mais c'est...
du April tout craché.
<i>Oui, je me souviens.</i>
Écoute, je suis désolé, Di.
Je pensais...
Je pensais que tu devais savoir.
J'apprécie.
Merci.
Au revoir.
Tu vas retourner à Seattle...
pas vrai ?
Avant, c'était une statue
de notre homonyme.
La nuit dernière,
des étudiants l'ont renversée et...
l'ont remplacée par ce truc.
Quand on leur demande pourquoi,
ils disent que c'est une statue
de Graham Holt.
Qui est ce... Graham Holt ?
C'est un étudiant de première année.
Étudiant quelconque en tout point.
Ce gamin fait une farce
et vous appelez le NTAC ?
Je l'ai fait, car je pense
que le gamin a pris des doses.
Il se passe des choses anormales ici.
Les affiches, la statue.
Hier soir, la major de promotion
a modifié son mémoire d'entrée
à Stanford.
Elle l'a lu
à sa conseillère d'orientation ce matin.
500 mots décrivant Holt
comme le plus grand chef spirituel
depuis le Christ.
Je l'ai convoqué
dans mon bureau ce matin.
Il prétend ne rien savoir
de ce qu'il se passe.
Il va falloir
qu'on parle à Graham Holt.
Désormais, votre groupe préféré
est <i>TV on the Radio</i>.
Pigé ?
<i>TV on the Radio</i>.
C'est le meilleur groupe.
Excusez-moi. Graham ?
Ces messieurs
souhaiteraient te parler.
Agents Baldwin et Garrity.
Nous sommes du NTAC.
Si tu veux bien nous suivre,
on va t'emmener au NTAC
et te faire subir un test,
voir si tu es positif
à la promicine.
- Pourquoi ?
- Regarde autour de toi, Graham.
Tu sais très bien pourquoi.
J'ai le choix ?
Tu as le choix d'y aller
avec ou sans menottes.
Si tu n'as rien pris,
tu n'as rien à craindre. Viens.
Vous êtes assis à ma place.
Je ne savais pas
que ces bancs étaient réservés.
Ils le sont.
Réellement.
Je suis en première année
à l'institut.
Art et design.
Je dois faire un dessin du parc
au fusain chaque jour, pendant 7 jours.
Vous êtes à ma place.
D'accord, je m'en vais.
- Je m'en vais.
- Merci, Kyle. Je vous remercie.
Comment connaissez-vous
mon nom ?
Franchement ?
Je vous ai reconnu
dès l'instant où je suis arrivée.
J'ai beaucoup lu
au sujet des 4400.
J'ai donc beaucoup lu
à votre sujet.
Vous savez donc tout
sur moi et Jordan Collier ?
Oui, bien sûr.
Difficile de passer à côté.
Ce n'est pas moi qui l'ai abattu, OK ?
Pas vraiment moi.
Je n'ai jamais vraiment cru
que c'était vous.
Vous ne ressemblez pas à un tueur.
Je vais le prendre
comme un compliment. Merci.
Je dois retourner bosser.
Bonne chance avec votre devoir.
Cassie... Dunleavy.
On se reverra peut-être.
Je serai là....
les 7 prochains jours.
Il y a une explication très simple
à ce qui se passe au lycée Stevenson.
Le gamin, Graham, a pris de la promicine
et tout le monde le prend pour Dieu.
Voyons... Je sais que vous aimez
aller droit au but, Marco,
mais vraiment, "Dieu" ?
Bien sûr, pas <i>le</i> Dieu.
Au mieux, c'est <i>un</i> Dieu.
Une divinité mineure.
Peu importe. Ces gamins érigent
des effigies à son image.
Ils sont prêts à se battre pour lui.
C'est de la vénération.
Heureusement
qu'il ne vous a pas convertis.
Quelques minutes avec Graham
et vous rentrez dans les ordres.
Pas de chance, en fait.
La dévotion aveugle se fait rare
à notre époque.
Elle pourrait apporter
un vrai sens à la vie.
- La clarifier.
- Bon, que fait-on avec ce gamin ?
On y retourne plus nombreux.
On l'isole...
- en espérant ne pas subir les effets.
- Mais j'agirais vite...
Graham semble bien décidé
à devenir le roi de l'école.
Imaginez qu'il devienne
un peu plus ambitieux ?
C'est quoi, ce bazar ?
Êtes-vous ici pour vous donner
corps et âme à Graham Holt ?
Pas vraiment.
Alors, je vous conseille de partir.
Ces rues sont siennes.
Nous les défendrons
au péril de nos vies.
Emmenez vos gars de ce côté.
C'est moi, Graham.
Que voulez-vous ?
<i>Tu dois arrêter ça, Graham.</i>
Si tu ne sors pas,
il va y avoir des blessés.
- C'est ce que tu veux ?
- <i>Bien sûr que non.</i>
Ils essaient seulement
de me protéger.
Tu les obliges à être là.
Tu leur as ôté toute volonté.
- Leurs vies sont entre tes mains.
- <i>Je comprends.</i>
<i>Je souhaite pas non plus
qu'il leur arrive du mal</i>
mais il me faut
un peu plus de temps.
<i>Une nuit pour régler tout ça.
OK ? Une nuit.</i>
On a gagné un peu de temps.
Faut qu'on se prépare.
Ne sois pas si triste, d'accord ?
Et qui sait ?
Elle ne pourra peut-être pas
entrer dans Seattle.
Elle reviendra peut-être
dans quelques heures.
Elle ne reviendra pas.
Elle a dit qu'elle le fera, Maia.
Et je me raccroche à cette idée.
Alors, Kyle... dites-moi,
vous allez toujours
voir votre cousin Shawn ?
Les journaux parlent plus beaucoup
de lui dernièrement.
- Il se remet ?
- Non.
Bizarre, car les docteurs disent
qu'il devrait se réveiller.
Son cerveau est actif,
ses signes vitaux sont bons.
C'est triste.
Il semblait être un chouette type.
Tout le monde a abandonné.
Se résignant dans l'attente
d'une longue guérison.
Je crois avoir lu un truc
sur la promicine dans son système.
Ce serait à cause du manque ?
Sans doute. Les docteurs disent
que c'est pour ça...
que son corps ne répond plus.
Mais ça n'a jamais été publié.
Ça a dû l'être.
Sinon, comment serais-je au courant ?
Écoutez, je ne suis pas docteur,
mais...
on pourrait peut-être lui injecter
une bonne vieille dose de promicine.
Ce serait comme lui recharger
ses batteries, non ?
Shawn est un 4400.
Ça ne lui fera pas de mal.
Oui, j'y ai pensé.
Les médecins rejettent cette idée.
La promicine est vraiment illégale.
Dommage que vous ne puissiez pas
vous en procurer.
Vous êtes peut-être
la seule personne
qui tienne assez à lui
pour tenter de le réveiller.
Ça fait des heures
qu'ils ne nous quittent pas des yeux.
Ils ne vont jamais aux toilettes ?
Attention !
Ne tirez pas !
Je m'appelle Graham Holt.
Je veux me rendre.
Il était temps.
Mains en l'air. Mains en l'air !
Bien, à genoux.
Doucement...
C'est pas lui !
Ce n'est pas Holt.
Ne tirez pas !
Je m'appelle Graham Holt.
À genoux ! Tout de suite !
Ne tirez pas !
Je suis Graham Holt...
Ne me combattez pas.
Rejoignez-moi.
NOUS RENCONTRONS
DES PROBLÈMES TECHNIQUES
VEUILLEZ PATIENTER
<i>Salut, tout le monde.
Je m'appelle Graham Holt.</i>
<i>Je tenais juste à vous dire</i>
<i>que vous n'avez rien à craindre.</i>
<i>Croire en moi ne fera pas
de vous une autre personne.</i>
<i>Vous aimerez toujours votre famille.</i>
<i>Vous continuerez
à vous lever le matin</i>
<i>et à faire ce que vous avez
l'habitude de faire.</i>
<i>Vous aurez plus d'ambitions
dans votre vie,</i>
<i>et tout le monde croira
en ce que vous faites,</i>
<i>et vous croirez
en ce qu'ils font.</i>
<i>Tout se passera bien.</i>
- <i>C'est promis.</i>
- Elle est partie.
Elle est sûrement partie dans la nuit.
Vous avez compris ?
Elle est partie.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Il faut la trouver
avant que quelqu'un d'autre le fasse.
Vous allez devoir y aller
sans moi.
Comment ça, "sans moi" ?
C'est Tess. Vous lui devez bien ça.
Je n'ai pas offert
la promicine au monde
pour le voir s'unir
autour d'un gamin de 16 ans.
On doit l'arrêter.
<i>Tout se passera bien, c'est promis.</i>
Je vois.
Un deuxième Messie est de trop.
Comment allez-vous l'arrêter, Jordan ?
Quiconque approche de ce gosse
finit par se rallier à lui.
En quoi seriez-vous différent ?
Et même si
vous vous approchiez de lui,
vous croyez qu'il va se passer quoi ?
Un miracle ?
J'en aurais besoin, n'est-ce pas ?
<i>Vous aurez plus d'ambitions
dans votre vie,</i>
<i>et tout le monde croira
en ce que vous faites,</i>
<i>et vous croirez
en ce qu'ils font.</i>
<i>Tout se passera bien.
C'est promis.</i>
Vous êtes cons ou quoi ?
Je suis du NTAC !
Nous sommes du même côté !
Arrêtez, lâchez-moi !
Les gars...
Ils arrêtent tout le monde au NTAC.
Comment ça ? Pourquoi ?
Nous devons vous amener en ville,
Monsieur.
Graham veut ramener le NTAC
dans le droit chemin.
D'accord, bonne idée.
On n'a pas le choix de toute façon.
- Ça va ?
- Oui.
Une partie de la police
s'est ralliée à Graham.
Les policiers arrêtent les gens,
ils les amènent à lui par centaines.
Je suis le roi de Seattle !
Kyle, réponds !
Je t'ai dit que
c'était dangereux dehors !
Rappelle-moi.
Pas de nouvelles de votre fils ?
- Non. Qu'a dit Washington ?
- Rien de bon.
Ils parlent déjà
de pertes acceptables,
d'attaques aériennes,
et d'envoyer une force armée.
Envahir une ville américaine ?
C'est plutôt une guerre civile.
Je sais. J'ai seulement pu gagner
quelques heures...
- Pour ?
- Rassembler les membres du NTAC
qui n'ont pas été convertis,
descendre en ville,
et se battre s'il le faut.
On essaiera d'approcher Graham,
voir si on peut l'atteindre
avant qu'il nous atteigne.
Oh, mon Dieu. Shawn !
Que s'est-il passé ?
Je sais pas, il était allongé
et il a été pris de convulsions.
Oh, mon Dieu...
Allez.
Shawn, c'est nous.
C'est Kyle.
Dis quelque chose si tu vas bien.
Allez.
Maman ?
Comment je suis arrivé là ?
M. Collier...
Vous avez bien fait de venir me voir.
Ça aurait été dommage
que je doive vous traquer.
On dirait
que le monde est à tes pieds.
Je voulais voir pourquoi.
Ne vous en faites pas.
Vous comprendrez bientôt pourquoi.
Je t'ai donné la promicine,
je peux la reprendre.
Que m'avez-vous fait ?
Je t'ai rendu ordinaire.
Tirez ! Maintenant !
Le monde n'a plus besoin de toi.
Je suis là.
Ressaisissez-vous !
<i>Graham n'aurait pas dû convertir
tant de flics.</i>
Un de ses anciens partisans l'a arrêté
devant le Palais de justice.
Il n'y a aucune trace de promicine
dans son système ?
Non, c'est juste un lycéen
qui doit répondre de ses actes.
On peut tous arrêter de se demander
si Collier a une capacité.
Il neutralise la promicine.
Je ne comprends pas.
Shawn n'a jamais parlé de Collier
faisant ça à un des 4400.
Ça ne marche peut-être pas sur eux.
Peut-être qu'il peut faire ça
qu'aux OGM.
Les OGM, vous voyez,
pas la recette originale des 4400 ?
Ceux qui ont pris de la promicine
puis acquis des aptitudes.
Alors Collier...
Il s'est rendu à Seattle,
a posé les mains sur lui,
et a résolu le problème
qui paniquait tant le gouvernement ?
Si j'étais chez moi
et que j'entendais ça à la télé,
vous savez ce que je me dirais ?
Les gens vénéraient
la mauvaise personne.
Collier vient de poster un message
sur Internet.
<i>Nous avons tous eu peur, aujourd'hui.</i>
<i>Nous en aurons d'autres
avant d'en avoir fini.</i>
<i>Le...</i>
<i>Le chemin que nous empruntons
est difficile et dangereux,</i>
<i>mais nous marchons
main dans la main.</i>
<i>Que vous ayez choisi
de me suivre ou non,</i>
<i>nous sommes tous,
chacun d'entre nous,</i>
<i>en train d'écrire l'Histoire.</i>
Un gardien de la prison de Kurland
vient d'appeler.
Isabelle Tyler a laissé
un message pour vous.
C'est tout ?
Le musée Powell  ?
Selon elle,
votre réponse est là-bas,
et vous le saurez
quand vous la verrez.
<i>Le temps de l'incertitude est révolu.</i>
<i>Place à la grandeur.</i>
<i>Chacun a un rôle à jouer.</i>
<i>Votre seul choix est de savoir
si vous l'acceptez,</i>
<i>ou s'il faudra vous l'imposer.</i>
<i>La promicine se répand,</i>
<i>les gens acquièrent des capacités,
<i>et personne n'y peut rien.</i>
Je suis désolée,
nous n'avons pas de Cassie Dunleavy
- dans cette école.
- Elle a dit être étudiante ici.
Je dois vraiment lui parler.
Je la trouve pas dans le bottin,
nulle part.
Elle vous a peut-être pas donné
son vrai nom.
Vous y avez pensé ?
<i>Le génie ne retournera pas
dans la lampe magique.</i>
<i>Je sais que c'est tentant,</i>
<i>de penser
qu'on peut s'accrocher au passé,</i>
<i>à tout ce qui est simple et sûr,</i>
<i>mais c'est impossible.</i>
<i>Et ce qui est simple et sûr,</i>
<i>est ce qui nous a menés
à la catastrophe en premier lieu.</i>
<i>Les chaînes du confort</i>
<i>nous empêchent
d'accéder à un monde meilleur.</i>
<i>Cette nouvelle ère,
elle n'arrive pas,</i>
<i>elle n'est pas en chemin,
elle est déjà là,</i>
<i>et nous sommes, dès maintenant,
séparés de nos vies d'avant</i>
<i>par un fossé
qu'il sera impossible de franchir.</i>
<i>Vous devez tous...</i>
<i>vous poser une question...</i>
<i>Y êtes-vous préparés ?</i>

These shots are free.
Give them to anyone
who wants them,
but be careful
to explain the risks.
Handing out promicin like candy
changes everything, Shawn.
Nobody can predict what's going
to happen once people everywhere
start developing abilities.
How's it going, sibling?
April Skouris,
black sheep of the family.
You don't really
know this girl, do you?
While we were planning
our wedding,
you were working with Ryland,
betraying me...
- Where's the promicin?
- Get your hands off of me.
He's stable.
that's the good news.
But he hasn't regained consciousness.
They don't know when he will.
I have a job offer
in Spain.
If you come with me.
If Collier's right, if moving
into this new world of his
means more upheaval
in the here and now,
I'm going to find myself a place
where I can live
at peace with my daughter
as long as I can.
Alana's picture's gone out
to every hospital
and law enforcement
agency in the country.
Nobody's seen her, Tom.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Kyle!
You ready? Come on, buddy.
It's starting soon.
You think
I'd be late for this?
I'm as psyched
as you are, dad.
Good,
let's do it, then.
I saved you
some seats.
Sorry.
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, Maia.
- You look nice.
- Thank you.
You said you'd be late,
so I held things up for you.
Hey, guys.
- How are you doing?
- How are you?
Hi, Tess.
Hi, honey.
Good to see you.
- Kevin...
- How are you?
I thought
you'd never make it.
Well, I had a little help.
Thank you.
I appreciate the applause,
even though I know
who it's really for.
We're all here to give thanks
to one man,
a man who took
a dark and dangerous world...
and healed it.
A man who eliminated
disease and war
and changed our ideas
of what it is to be a human being.
He made 4400 abilities
available to everyone,
and all of our lives
are better for it.
Some call him
a savior,
some call him a messiah.
He's all that and more.
Ladies and gentlemen, M. Jordan Collier.
Today,
this morning,
here and everywhere,
it is good to be alive!
United, like humanity
has never been united.
Through promicin,
the gift I brought you,
and that you... accepted.
Together, we have created
heaven on earth,
a time of joy,
endless joy,
that we share
as one.
And for that,
I say let us bow our heads
in thanks.
It's okay.
It was a dream.
You were dreaming...
again.
What was it about this time?
I handed out the promicin.
I stopped the catastrophe.
It was the right thing to do.
We saved the future from...
I know...
what kind of world I prevented.
But is the world I created
any better?

More, please.
That is
so disgusting.
You said you wouldn't do that
in front of me anymore.
It's gross.
It's not disgusting.
It's love,
and one day,
you'll understand.
So, mommy,
when are you going to tell us?
Tell us what?
Mommy got the job offer.
The job with the european union
came through?
She'll be advising them
on all things 4400.
They said we could live
anywhere in the E.U.
The benefit package
is unbelievable.
Is there anything
the job doesn't come with?
Yeah, a gun,
which makes it
just about perfect.
If I take this,
it means that we're not
just on vacation anymore.
We have to settle down
somewhere.
So how about it?
Is everyone ready
to put down some roots?
- Hey, dad.
- When did you get back into town?
Why didn't you call me?
Honestly?
The way things left off, I wasn't sure
you wanted to hear from me.
You said you wanted some distance.
I was trying to respect that,
but you should
know you...
You can talk to me any time.
I start this new job tomorrow.
It's a legal aid thing
helping out the 4400.
I was going to get a hotel, you know,
while I looked for an apartment,
but it just seemed kind of stupid
you being here all by yourself.
Still no word
on Alana?
I could use some company.
I'm sorry she's gone, dad.
I really liked her.
She loved you.
Yeah, I know.
I keep hoping
that I'll come home some day,
and she's just going to be here.
I'm going to go unpack. OK?
I want to go
see Shawn later.
Welcome home.
Thanks.
<i>The good news is
I'm not dead.
<i>I took the shot three days ago
and I'm still here.
<i>The bad news?
<i>I can't blow things up
with my mind,
<i>or fly,
<i>or do anything differently
at all.
<i>I'm still just me.
<i>Graham...
A.K.A. No one.
OK, so...
I kind of want to
go to the prom with Jeff.
Amber!
<i>Such a stupid geek.
All right, guys, get in here.
Time to pick teams.
Come on, move it.
Line up over here, guys.
Come on, Mike! You're always
the last one. Hurry up!
I'll take...
Graham.
I want Graham.
Me?
Wait a minute.
- I'm taking Graham.
- Guys...
come one,
stop messing with me.
Everyone knows
I suck at basketball.
Listen up.
If Graham doesn't want to
shoot hoops,
then hoops is off the menu.
So how about it,
Graham?
What do you
want to play?
You're serious?
Absolutely.
We can play
whatever you want.
Tell us what to do.
- Thumb wrestling?
- All right...
thumb wrestling it is.
Pair up!
You two over here,
come on, come on, move it!
You two guys, over here.
Mike, you and Billy over here.
What's going on?
Say hello to
the new head of NTAC.
I don't get it.
The woman doesn't have a single day
of law enforcement experience.
She works in a think tank
for a few years,
so they give her a gun and a badge
and tell her to go play sheriff?
I heard she managed
the flow of refugees
after the hurricanes
in texas,
- and did a good job of it, too.
- She's a political appointment.
Probably smiled at the right person
at some cocktail party,
so they passed over
all the qualified people.
Oh, and, Tom...
she said she wanted to see you
as soon as you got in.
- Hi. I'm...
- ... Tom Baldwin.
I know.
Meghan Doyle.
Does that look
straight to you?
Sure. That...
It looks good.
You must like subtitles.
Have you ever seen
<i>La Dolce Vita</i>?
Honestly? No.
I'm getting the distinct impression
no one else around here has either,
but that's okay.
You should check it out, though.
Okay, I'll do that.
Relax, Tom.
It's not homework.
Please, come
and sit down.
There's something
I want you to see.
Something to get us off
on the right foot.
Open it.
It's interesting.
You do know I'm not cleared
to read this?
Of course,
but I've read your file.
You don't seem like the kind of agent
who'd let that bother you.
Go ahead.
I won't tell if you won't.
This is all about Isabelle Tyler.
- Why are you showing me this?
- She can have visitors now.
I figured you might
want to see her.
I know you've been looking for
Alana Mareva for three months.
I also know
that you're at a dead end.
You must have considered the possibility
that she was abducted again.
Of course, people don't just fall
off the edge of the planet.
Isabelle Tyler
is the one person alive
with a tangible connection
to the future.
If they did take Alana,
maybe Isabelle will be able to
tell you something.
You sure this isn't going to
blow back on you?
You just started.
I don't want to get you in trouble.
If I succeed in this job,
if I bring in Jordan Collier,
no one's going to mind
if a few rules are broken along the way,
and if I don't,
no amount of toeing the line
will save me.
I appreciate this.
Thanks.
You know those posters.
You have a taste for foreign films,
people think you're intellectual
or a radical.
The truth is,
I just like the movies.
Are you sure you don't like
that they make people uncomfortable?
Maybe that, too.
Hey, buddy.
Can you hear me?
My dad says
when I was in a coma,
he used to talk to me
all the time.
I don't remember any of it,
but...
who knows?
Maybe it helped.
I wish there was something
I could do for you.
I tried.
Three months ago,
I took the shot.
I was so scared,
but I just did it anyway.
I was thinking
maybe I could wake you up.
Same as you did for me.
Want to hear the punch line?
Nothing happened.
Three months, no ability.
Nothing. I mean, nothing.
Nothing's changed at all,
really.
That's weird, huh?
I tried.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Are you lost?
Help me.
Help me.
<i>There are dead people
everywhere I go.
They hate me.
I made them dead.
We made them dead.
Tess, we gave them a choice.
We didn't force
the shots on anyone.
I want you to take
your medication.
All right?
It'll make you feel better.
Come on,
come on.
She'll calm down
once she's had her pills.
Is that your medical opinion?
Tess is schizophrenic.
The strain of hiding out,
the guilt over what we did,
she can't handle it.
It's caused a break.
She needs medical care
beyond what
we can provide.
Till I find a doctor
sympathetic to us,
you'll have to administer
her medications yourself.
Well, you just remember,
Tess' ability...
is what keeps you safe.
If it wasn't for her, you'd have
been arrested a long time ago.
And I promise you,
I don't care
if the fate of the world is at stake,
I will not sacrifice Tess
to you.
Or your cause.
Our cause, Kevin.
Ours.
Hey, guys.
- What's up?
- All of us were talking,
and we just want you to know
we're with you.
All of us.
We believe.
- In what?
- In you.
We're not the only ones.
We brought someone.
Oh, my god.
Amber?
What are you doing here?
I came to be with you.
What the hell is going...
Amber, wait a minute.
You know those shots
you always hear about on the news?
I took them.
I think maybe
it's screwing you guys up.
No, Graham, it's you.
We want to be close to you.
We want to be close
to the light.
- What light?
- The one that shines out of you.
I didn't see it until today,
but now I do.
It's beautiful.
You're beautiful.
Are you sure
you want to do this?
They told you to kill me.
You didn't do it.
Did you ever think maybe
that's why your girlfriend's gone?
It's your punishment.
Is that something you think,
or is that something you know?
How's Shawn?
Any change?
He's in a regular hospital now.
Long-term care.
What about my father?
Has anybody heard from him?
No, he's on our list,
and we'll find him.
Now, Isabelle,
if you know anything
about Alana, please tell me.
Just tell me, please!
You want to have hope,
don't you?
You want to believe
she's coming back.
Of course.
Then you don't want to know
what I know.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I really am,
but they used you.
The same way they used me.
- <i>Hola</i>?
- <i>Hey, Diana.</i>
It's me, Marco.
<i>Are you having
a good time in Spain?</i>
Yeah, hey, Marco!
Yeah, no, everything's good.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
Uh, something came up, though.
<i>A couple days ago,
some agents raided an apartment.</i>
<i>There was a lot of promicin there.</i>
One of the guys they brought in
gave up a whole bunch of names.
People they'd given syringes to?
Okay, so what is it
you want to tell me, Marco?
One of the names
was April Skouris.
My sister took the shots?
<i>The guy didn't know
if she actually injected them,</i>
<i>but she definitely had them.</i>
<i>Have you heard from her?</i>
No, I haven't heard from her
in months.
She didn't call me on my birthday,
but I...
figured, April, you know?
<i>Yeah, I remember.</i>
Look, I'm sorry, Di.
I just... You know,
I thought you should know.
I appreciate it.
Thanks.
Bye.
You're going back to Seattle,
aren't you?
That used to be a statue
of our namesake.
Last night,
a dozen students tore it down
and put that thing up.
When we asked them why,
they said it was a statue
of Graham Holt.
Who's Graham Holt?
He's a junior.
C student.
Basically unremarkable in every way.
So this kid pulls a prank,
and you call NTAC?
I called NTAC because I think maybe
this kid took some of those shots.
I mean, what's going on around here
isn't normal.
The posters, the statue.
Last night, our valedictorian
revised her application essay
to Stanford.
She read it to her guidance counselor
this morning.
It's 500 words
on how Graham Holt
is the most important
spiritual leader
since the time of Christ.
I called him into my office
earlier this morning.
He claims to have no idea
about what's going on.
I think we need to meet
this Graham Holt.
From now on,
everyone's favorite band
is <i>TV on the Radio</i>.
Got that?
<i>TV on the Radio</i>.
They're the best band out there.
Excuse me. Graham?
These gentlemen'd like
to have a word with you.
I'm agent Baldwin.
this is agent Garrity.
We work at NTAC.
We're gonna have
to ask you to come with us.
We're gonna bring you in to NTAC
and give you a test
to see if you're
promicin positive.
- Why?
- Look around you, Graham.
I think you know why.
Do I have a choice?
You have a choice whether or not
you do it in handcuffs.
If you haven't taken the shot,
you don't have anything
to worry about. Come on.
You're sitting in my spot.
I didn't realize
these benches were assigned.
Well, they are.
Literally.
I'm in my first year
at the institute.
Art and design?
I'm supposed to do
a charcoal sketch
of a view from the park
every day for seven days.
You're in my spot.
Okay. I'll move.
- I'll move.
- Thanks, Kyle.
I appreciate that.
How do you know my name?
Honestly?
I recognized you
as soon as I walked up.
I read a lot about the 4400.
Which means I read a lot about you.
I guess you know all about
me and Jordan Collier?
Yeah, I do.
Kind of hard to avoid.
You know it wasn't me
who shot him right?
Not really me.
I didn't really believe it was you.
You didn't look like a killer to me.
I guess that's a kind of compliment.
Thank you.
I have to get back to work,
but good luck
with your assignment.
Cassie...
Dunleavy.
Maybe I'll see you around.
I'll be here
for the next seven days.
Seems to me there's
a very simple explanation
for what's going on
at Stevenson High.
This kid, Graham,
took the promicin shot,
and now everyone who meets him
thinks he's god.
Come on, come on.
I've heard you tend to move
directly to the point, Marco,
but really, god?
Well, obviously,
he's not <i>the</i> god.
At best, he's <i>a</i> god,
a minor deity.
Whatever. These kids
are building effigies of him.
They're willing to fight us
to protect him.
Sounds like worship to me.
You are lucky
you weren't turned.
Seems like you only need
a couple minutes around Graham
before you find religion.
Maybe they're unlucky.
Absolute devotion is
a rarity in the modern age.
It might bring a real sense
of purpose to life.
- A clarity.
- Guys, what do we do with this kid?
We go back with more people.
We isolate him.
- Hope the effects wear off.
- But I'd do it fast.
Sounds like Graham's
pretty much focused
on being king of the school.
Imagine what happens
if he learns to think
a little more ambitiously.
What the hell is that?
Are you here
to give yourselves
body and soul
to Graham Holt?
Not exactly.
Then I suggest you leave.
These streets are his.
We'll defend them
with our lives.
Just take your men
around that way.
This is me, Graham.
- What do you want?
- <i>I want you to end this, Graham.</i>
If you don't come out,
these people are gonna get hurt.
- That what you want?
- <i>No, of course not.</i>
These people are just
trying to protect me.
You're forcing them to be here.
You've taken away their free will.
- Their lives are in your hands.
- <i>I understand.</i>
<i>I don't want anything bad
to happen to them either,</i>
but you just need to
give me some time.
<i>Like, a night to figure this out.</i>
<i>Okay? One night.</i>
I just bought us some time.
We've got planning to do.
Try not to look so gloomy, okay?
And who knows?
She might not even be able
to get into Seattle.
She'd be right back here
in a couple hours.
She's never coming back here.
She said she is, Maia,
and I really need
to believe that.
So, Kyle,
tell me,
you ever go visit
your cousin, Shawn?
Hasn't been much in the paper
about him lately.
- Is he getting any better?
- No, he's not.
Which is weird
cause the doctors say
there's no reason
why he shouldn't be awake.
His brain's active,
his vital signs are okay.
That's so sad.
He seemed like
a really good guy.
Everyone's just given up.
Settling in for the long haul.
Didn't I read something
about the promicin in his system?
The doctors think it's all out of whack?
That's right.
They think that's why he...
His body shut down but I don't think
that made it into the papers.
Well, it must have.
How else would I know about it?
Okay, I know I'm not a doctor,
but maybe someone
should try injecting him
with a big old dose of promicin.
It'd be like giving him
a jump start, right?
Shawn's a 4400.
- Probably wouldn't hurt him.
- I've thought about that.
The doctors won't even consider it.
Promicin is seriously illegal.
Too bad you can't
get your hands on any.
You might be the only person
in his life who cares enough
to actually take a shot
at waking him up.
They've just been standing here
staring at us for hours.
Don't they ever have to
use the bathroom?
Head's up.
Don't shoot!
My name's Graham Holt.
I want to surrender.
It's about time.
Hands up.
keep your hands up.
All right, on your knees.
Easy...
It's not him!
It's not holt!
Don't shoot!
My name's Graham Holt.
On your knees!
Now! On your knees!
Don't shoot!
I'm Graham Holt...
Don't fight me.
Join me.
<i>Hey, everyone.
my name's Graham Holt.</i>
<i>I just wanted to say,</i>
<i>you have nothing
to be afraid of.</i>
<i>Believing in me doesn't
make you a different person.</i>
<i>You'll still love your family.</i>
<i>You'll still wake up
in the morning</i>
<i>and go do
whatever it is you do.</i>
<i>You'll just have more purpose,</i>
<i>and everyone will believe
exactly what you do,</i>
<i>and you'll believe
what they do.</i>
<i>It's all going to be very cool.</i>
- <i>I promise.</i>
- She's gone.
She must have left
in the middle of the night.
Did you hear me?
She's gone.
What are you doing?
We have to find her
before someone picks her up.
You'll have to go without me.
What do you mean,
"go without you"?
This is Tess. You owe her.
I did not give out promicin
to the world
to have it unite
under a 16-year-old boy.
He has to be stopped.
<i>It's all going to be very cool,
I promise.</i>
I see.
You're having messiah envy.
How are you going to stop him,
Jordan?
Anybody who gets near that kid
winds up praying to him.
What makes you any different?
And even if you could
get close to him,
what do you expect to happen?
A miracle?
I guess I need one, don't I?
<i>...you'll just have more purpose,</i>
<i>and everyone will believe
exactly what you do,</i>
<i>and you'll believe
what they do.</i>
<i>It's all going to be very cool,
I promise.</i>
Are you guys nuts?
I'm an NTAC agent!
We're on the same side!
Hey, come on, come on!
Guys, guys...
They're arresting
everybody at NTAC.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Our orders are
to bring you all downtown, sir.
Graham wants to bring
NTAC into the fold.
Fine. Fine. Sounds good.
What choice do we have, huh?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Graham converted
a couple of police stations.
The cops are arresting people,
bringing them to him
by the hundreds.
I'm the king of Seattle!
Why aren't you picking up
the phone?
I told you it's dangerous
outside right now.
Now, call me back.
Still no word from your son?
- No. What did D.C. say?
- Nothing good.
They're already talking
acceptable losses,
air strikes, sending
an army division into the city.
They're gonna invade an american city?
Sounds a lot like civil war to me.
I know. Best I could do
was buy us a couple hours.
- To do what?
- We have to gather everyone from NTAC
that hasn't been converted,
make our way downtown,
fight our way downtown
if we have to.
We'll try to get close to Graham.
We'll see if we can get to him
before he gets to us.
Oh, my god. Shawn!
What happened?
I don't know. He was just lying there
and he started convulsing.
Oh, my god...
Hey, come on.
Hey, Shawn. Hey...
Hey, it's us.
It's Kyle.
Say something if you're okay.
Come on.
Mom?
How did I get here?
Mr. Collier...
You did the right thing
coming to me.
It would've been a shame
if I had to track you down.
Seems the world
is falling at your feet.
I wanted to see why.
Don't worry.
Soon, it's all going to make
perfect sense to you.
I gave you promicin.
I can take it away.
What did you do to me?
I made you ordinary.
Shoot him!
Shoot him now!
The world
doesn't need you anymore.
It has me.
Get on with your lives.
Graham shouldn't have converted
so many cops.
One of his former followers
arrested him right there,
on the steps of the courthouse.
And there's no trace of promicin
in his system? Nothing?
No, he's just a high school kid
with a lot to answer for.
I guess we can all stop
wondering if Collier has an ability.
He can neutralize promicin.
I don't get it.
Shawn never said anything about Collier
doing that to one of the original 4400.
Maybe it doesn't work on them.
Maybe he can only do it
to the extra crispies.
Extra crispies,
you know, like,
not the original recipe 4400?
People who took the promicin shot
and then got an ability.
So Collier...
walked into what was essentially
an occupied Seattle,
laid hands on this kid,
and solved a problem
that had the entire
U.S. government in a panic.
If I was sitting at home
watching this story on the 6:00 news,
you want to know what I'd be thinking?
People were praying
to the wrong guy.
Collier just posted a message
on the Internet.
<i>We all had a scare today.</i>
<i>We'll have others
before we're done.</i>
<i>We...</i>
<i>We're walking a difficult
and a dangerous path,</i>
<i>but we're walking it together.</i>
<i>Whether you've chosen
to join me or not,</i>
</i>we're all, every one of us,</i>
<i>making history now.</i>
I got a call from the warden
at kurland prison.
There's a message for you
from Isabelle Tyler.
That's it?
The Powell museum?
She said your answer's there,
and you'll know it
when you see it.
<i>The time for
sitting on the fence is over.</i>
<i>The time for greatness is now.</i>
<i>Each of you has a role to play.</i>
<i>Your only choice
is whether you accept it</i>
<i>or have it thrust upon you.</i>
<i>Promicin is out there.</i>
<i>People are gaining abilities,</i>
<i>and nothing can be done
about that...</i>
I'm sorry, sir. There's no student
named Cassie Dunleavy
- registered at this school...
- She said she's a student here.
I really need to talk to her.
Can't find in the phonebook
can't find her anywhere.
Maybe she didn't give you
her real name.
Have you thought of that?
<i>The genie will not go back
into the bottle.</i>
<i>I know it's tempting...</i>
<i>to think that we can hold on
to the past,</i>
<i>to everything
that's safe and easy,</i>
<i>but we cannot,</i>
<i>and safe and easy,</i>
<i>are what set us on the path
to catastrophe in the first place.</i>
<i>The chains of comfort...</i>
<i>are what keep us from reaching
for a better world.</i>
<i>This new era, it's not coming,</i>
<i>it's not on the way,
it's here,</i>
<i>and we are now separated
from our old lives</i>
<i>by a gulf that can never again
be bridged.</i>
<i>So all of you, out there,</i>
<i>need to ask yourself one thing,</i>
<i>are you ready?</i>

C'est irréversible
Le monde devra nous accepter.

Comme d'habitude.
Cassie... Dunlevy.
On se reverra peut-être.
Vous allez voir votre cousin Shawn ?
Est-ce qu'il se remet ?
Quelqu'un pourrait lui injecter
une bonne dose de promicine.
Ce serait comme lui recharger
ses batteries.
Depuis le retour des 4400,
les sacrifices s'enchaînent.
Cela doit s'arrêter.
Ça a marché, hein ?
Je ne suis pas mort.
Pas cette fois, non.
Peut-être serez-vous moins chanceux
la prochaine fois.
Ils t'ont dit de me tuer,
mais tu ne l'as pas fait.
Et si c'était pour ça
que ton amie a disparu ?
Je sais que vous recherchez Alana
depuis 3 mois.
Vous avez dû envisager la possibilité

- Salut...
- Bonjour, Tom.
J'ai su pour ta soeur.
J'étais sûr que tu reviendrais.
- Ben et Maia sont ici ?
- Non, en Espagne...
Je repartirai dès que j'aurai compris
ce qui se passe avec April.
Tu as des pistes ?
Personne ne l'a vue
depuis des mois.
Je ne sais même pas
si elle est encore vivante.
Ce n'est pas parce qu'elle avait
de la promicine qu'elle en a pris.
On parle d'April, là.
Si elle en avait, elle en a pris.
Écoute...
si je peux faire
quoi que ce soit pour toi,
n'hésite pas.
En fait...
j'espérais que tu pourrais me parler
de ton nouveau patron.
Meghan Doyle ?
Elle est jeune, sans expérience,
issue d'un groupe de réflexion,
donc très théorique. Pourquoi ?
J'envisageais de demander
ma réintégration temporaire.
Je pense qu'en ayant accès
aux ressources du NTAC,
je serais plus efficace.
Je ne suis pas sûr
qu'elle approuve ta réintégration.
Alors, je lui dirai que je reviens
définitivement.
Tu vas lui mentir ?
Pour ma soeur,
je suis prête à tout.
Je suis désolée de t'embêter
avec tout ça.
Je sais que tu as bien d'autres soucis.
Des nouvelles d'Alana ?
Je dois bien admettre
que la ressemblance est frappante.
Tu n'as rien trouvé sur elle
dans tous ces bouquins d'art ?
Tout ce que je sais,
c'est que de juin à septembre 1885,
Claude Pierrot a peint 6 portraits
d'une femme appelée Alana.
Qui elle était, ce qu'elle est devenue,
autant de mystères, mais en tout cas...
C'est elle, Diana, c'est Alana.
Et tu penses qu'ils l'ont renvoyée
dans le passé pour te punir
de ne pas avoir tué Isabelle ?
Je pense que ces gens du futur
l'ont envoyée et qu'ils l'ont reprise.
Je crois qu'il n'y a aucun moyen
d'en être sûrs.
Peut-être bien que si.
Je sais comment les contacter,
je l'ai déjà fait.
S'il te plaît, ne va pas faire
quelque chose de stupide.
Je ne te remercierai jamais assez
d'avoir ramené Maia,
mais tu as essayé de te suicider.
Ils t'ont sauvé uniquement
parce qu'ils avaient besoin de toi
et ce n'est plus le cas.
Ça fait 3 mois déjà.
Je ne sais plus quoi faire.
Où que soit Alana,
quoiqu'il lui soit arrivé,
elle ne veut pas te voir mourir.
Éloignez-les de moi !
Pitié, ils veulent me tuer !
Il a tous les symptômes
d'une crise de frayeur aiguë.
Dans le cas de M. Kopelow,
la peur des clowns.
Mais pour provoquer ce genre
de réaction, il ne faudrait pas...
comment dire...
de vrais clowns ?
C'est ce qui rend son cas
si atypique.
Il n'y a pas de facteur déclenchant.
Combien sont dans le même cas ?
Huit, en moins de deux heures,
c'est pour cela
que je vous ai appelés.
Nous avons tous
nos propres phobies...
les insectes, le vertige,
mais on apprend à vivre avec.
Chez ces personnes,
cette adaptation est inexistante.
Ils voient leurs pires frayeurs
prendre vie.
Et vous pensez
qu'un 4400 en serait responsable ?
Quelqu'un ou quelque chose
transforme leurs...
peurs inconscientes
en phobies insurmontables.
Excusez-moi.
Huit cas en deux heures....
Il y en a qui ne chôment pas.
Et ce n'est certainement
que le début.

Vous pensez qu'un de mes employés
a rendu ces gens fous ?
On sait seulement
que 5 des 8 victimes
possédaient un ticket
d'un de vos DAB.
D'après le relevé des transactions,
ils sont tous passés
entre 7h12 et 7h28 ce matin.
La banque n'est même pas ouverte.
Ce qui signifie
que le personnel est innocent, non ?
Ils devront quand même tous passer
un test de promicine, par précaution.
Regarde ça.
Max Kopelow.
Et regarde dans la queue derrière lui...
Jacqui Glendon.
Notre victime de claustrophobie.
Regarde là. Il n'y a pas de son,
mais on dirait qu'il y a
une sorte d'altercation,
presque hors caméra, juste là.
T'en penses quoi ?
Qu'il faut la liste de tous ceux
qui sont passés ce matin.
- Je peux vous avoir ça.
- Parfait.
Salut, la belle au bois dormant !
Ça fait quoi, d'être réveillé ?
Plutôt du bien.
Ils me virent d'ici aujourd'hui.
Tu rentres chez toi ?
C'est génial.
La meute de journalistes dehors
va pouvoir se réjouir.
Ils seront peut-être déçus
si je me barre en douce.
Je me tâte.
C'est impressionnant le retard
que j'ai à combler.
Il y a eu tant...
de choses incroyables
qui se sont produites en 3 mois.
Le changement est douloureux,
il faut en payer le prix.
Tu cites Jordan Collier, maintenant ?
À t'entendre,
on croirait que c'est mal.
Je ne pensais pas
qu'il y arriverait...
Distribuer toute la promicine.
Il savait ce qui allait arriver,
que tous ces gens mourraient.
C'est regrettable pour eux,
mais j'ai vu la promicine
réaliser des choses hallucinantes.
Je parie
que je devrais te remercier, non ?
- Pour quoi ?
- Allez, Kyle.
J'ai vaguement entendu les docteurs.
Ils ont observé une sorte de...
pic sur mon taux de promicine
et c'est ce qui m'a réveillé.
Tu étais là, avec maman
quand c'est arrivé
et j'ai du mal à croire...
que ma mère sache
où trouver une dose.
Ça fait trois mois, mec.
Les docteurs ne pensaient pas
que tu te réveillerais,
il fallait essayer un truc.
Et ton père ?
Il va savoir que c'est toi.
Sûrement.
San Sebastian est l'une des plus
belles villes au monde
et la vue sur la baie, le soir...
C'est vraiment impressionnant.
Si je devais tout abandonner
pour revenir ici,
avec ma fille et mon ami,
je trouverais ça vraiment difficile.
Ça n'a pas été
une décision facile.
Mais sachant que cette séparation
ne serait que temporaire,
cela a dû la faciliter.
Je ne sais pas
si je resterai longtemps.
Peut-être un long moment.
Au moins le temps nécessaire
pour retrouver votre soeur.
Écoutez, Diana,
vous recherchez April
par vos propres moyens
et vous êtes bloquée.
Mais munie d'un badge du NTAC,
ces difficultés disparaîtront
comme par magie.
Je vois bien ce que vous gagnez
dans cet arrangement, mais...
que vais-je y gagner ?
Moi.
Vous me gagnez, moi.
Que ce soit temporaire ou non,
un agent expérimenté vous serait utile.
C'est à peu près ce que disait
votre ancien collègue, Tom.
Un homme intelligent.
Vous devriez l'écouter.
Laissez-moi
vous poser une question.
Avez-vous déjà vu
<i>La Dolce Vita</i> ?
Doublé ou sous-titré ?
Ai-je l'air de quelqu'un
qui regarde des films doublés ?
Et moi ?
Bon retour chez nous,
agent Skouris.
Vous me reprenez parce que
j'aime les films étrangers ?
Bien sûr que non.
Mais ça joue en votre faveur.
Me transférer ?
Où ça ?
Vers un nouveau site, réservé à ceux
qui ont développé des capacités
que le gouvernement
n'estime pas menaçantes.
Ils sont...
maintenus sous inhibiteur,
mais sinon, ça...
ressemble moins à une prison
et plus à un...
... Camp d'internement ?
Il y a un terrain de sport,
une bibliothèque
et bien sûr, vous pourrez
rencontrer les autres détenus.
Ça a l'air sympa.
Mieux qu'ici, en tout cas.
Alors, nous organiserons
votre transfert.
Mais d'abord,
vous devez signer ceci.
C'est une autorisation,
nous permettant de tester
votre tolérance à la promicine.
Vous voulez voir si je peux
retrouver mes capacités ?
Nous voulons nous assurer
que ça n'arrivera pas.
La substance que vous a injectée
votre père a neutralisé vos capacités
mais avant de vous transférer
dans un autre endroit,
nous devons être sûrs
qu'elles ne reviendront pas.
Et si elles reviennent ?
Nous sommes prêts
à pallier cette éventualité.
Ce matin, quand vous attendiez au DAB,
vous avez remarqué ce gars ?
Je ne faisais pas vraiment attention.
J'avais un appel pour le boulot.
Le NTAC vous propose-t-il
une bonne assurance vie ?
Avez-vous remarqué
quoi que ce soit d'anormal là-bas ?
Quelqu'un se comportant
bizarrement ?
Il y avait ce type...
Je crois qu'il se plaignait
de faire la queue, c'était trop long.
Qu'a-t-il dit exactement ?
Il disait
que la banque était trop radine
pour mettre en place
un 2e distributeur.
Il avait raison, d'ailleurs.
À quoi ressemblait-il ?
La vingtaine. Il portait
une casquette de baseball.
Un gars normal. On s'attarde rarement
sur les gens dans une banque.
Sauf s'ils la cambriolent, pas vrai ?
Il nous en manque un.
Merci.
M. Kennedy !
Je suis l'agent Garrity, NTAC.
Stop !
Allez, les escaliers.
J'ai préparé ton ancienne chambre.
Danny, accompagne ton frère à l'étage
pendant que je prépare le déjeuner.
Que dis-tu d'une salade au thon ?
C'est ce que je préfère.
C'est bon...
Allez, Troy, parle-nous.
Pourquoi as-tu attaqué ces gens ?
Tu as un problème
avec la banque Columbia ?
Ou alors, tu l'as fait pour rigoler.
Tu trouves ça marrant de rendre
les gens tarés ? C'est ça ?
Non. Écoutez.
J'admets avoir pris de la promicine.
J'ai perdu mon boulot,
je suis interdit bancaire,
ma copine m'a largué.
Je...
J'étais désespéré.
J'ai pris une dose
pour améliorer ma vie.
Améliorer.
Et comment, hein ?
En rendant dingues
quelques personnes ?
Ils sont en psychiatrie
à Abendson,
à se débattre
dans leur camisole.
C'était pas moi, je vous jure.
Mon aptitude est inoffensive.
Je joue de la musique.
Je prends un instrument
et je deviens un virtuose.
Vraiment ?
Je vais aller chercher
ma clarinette, alors.
Les gars...
Vous pouvez venir une seconde ?
J'avais la police de Seattle
au téléphone. Un nouveau cas de...
Je ne sais même pas comment dire...
De crise de phobie ?
- On peut dire ça.
- On a reçu un appel d'urgence
il y a 10 minutes d'un appartement
du côté de Lakemont.
Il semble que le proprio
hurlait comme un cinglé
parce que sa maison
était remplie de germes.
On retient Kennedy
depuis des heures.
Alors, ce n'est pas lui,
ce qui veut dire
que le coupable court toujours.
Génial.
D'accord.
Quand vas-tu renvoyer
tes candidatures ?
J'ai encore un mois environ...
en admettant que je les renvoie.
Comment ça, "en admettant" ?
Je croyais que tu voulais devenir
le nouveau Clarence Darrow.
Oui, je le croyais aussi,
mais à présent,
avec tout ce qui se passe,
le monde est différent.
Étudier le droit
me semble tellement dérisoire.
C'est pas parce que le monde change
que tu dois changer.
C'est peut-être ce que je veux.
Le monde est divisé en 2 classes,
maintenant.
Ceux qui ont des capacités,
des gens comme toi,
capables de choses incroyables
et puis les simples péquenauds,
qui se contentent de...
vivre en essayant de ne pas penser
à ce qu'ils pourraient devenir.
Tu sais...
j'y ai beaucoup pensé,
et...
je crois que je vais prendre
une dose de promicine.
Ces doses sont mortelles.
Je suis conscient des risques.
- Je crois que ça vaut le coup.
- Non.
Pas quand on a un avenir
comme le tien.
Pense aux risques, d'accord ?
Tu as 50 % de chances
que ce soit un suicide.
De quoi as-tu vraiment peur, Shawn ?
Que je meure,
ou que j'acquière une capacité ?
Ça nous mettrait à égalité
et tu le redoutes.
- Ça n'a rien à voir avec toi et moi.
- Si, c'est exactement ça !
J'ai cru que ça te ferait plaisir.
J'ai cru que tu m'aiderais,
mais j'ai dû me tromper.
- Écoute-moi...
- Shawn, c'est cool que tu ailles mieux,
vraiment, mais je te demande pas
ta permission.
On en trouve partout et j'en prendrai,
avec ou sans ton aide.
Je dois nettoyer.
J'ai pas terminé.
J'ai pas terminé.
J'ai pas nettoyé.
Y a des germes partout.
Arrêtez...
Ne me touchez pas.
Qu'est-il arrivé à ses mains ?
On l'a trouvé en train de les frotter
avec un tampon Jex.
J'ai jeté un oeil à son appartement.
D'après ses relevés, ce type
a un compte à Washington Prime
et pas Columbia Fidelity.
Rien à voir avec
l'incident de la banque.
Ou alors,
il a rencontré la victime ailleurs.
On va tout fouiller,
interroger les locataires,
- voir si un lien existe.
- D'accord.
Je peux vous aider ?
Alors, il s'agit de Ray ?
J'ai vu qu'on l'avait emmené
dans une ambulance.
L'avez-vous vu auparavant ?
Peut-être plus tôt dans la matinée ?
Non, mais mon mari, oui.
On a une fuite depuis une semaine,
et Ray n'est toujours pas passé
pour réparer.
À quelle heure votre mari
doit-il rentrer ?
Pourquoi ?
Ils ne se sont pas battus.
Tu sais, quand j'étais petit,
je jouais avec des trains, aussi.
Comme toi...
Rassurez-vous,
vous n'y êtes pour rien.
Brandon est autiste.
Il aime que les choses soient en ordre.
Voilà. Tu vois ?
C'est mieux ?
Excusez-moi ?
- C'est votre mari ?
- Oui, c'est Ryan.
Pourquoi ?
C'est pas un des gars
du distributeur ?
Je crois qu'on a trouvé notre lien.
Tu veux que je parle à Danny ?
Tu pourrais arriver
à le raisonner,
le convaincre qu'il serait fou
de prendre une dose.
Je ne peux pas, Shawn.
Si Danny veut de la promicine...
il faut lui en donner.
Kyle, c'est pas
n'importe quel paumé
qui n'a rien à perdre.
C'est mon petit frère.
Cette dose pourrait le tuer.
Ça ne m'a pas tué, moi.
Tu as pris de la promicine ?
Kyle, tu as pris de la promicine ?
Il y a 3 mois.
Ma main tremblait tellement,
je pouvais à peine tenir la seringue,
mais j'ai survécu.
J'ai pas développé de capacité, mais...
j'ai survécu.
Depuis quand tu tiens tant
à avoir une capacité ?
Je parle de changer les choses,
pas juste d'acquérir une capacité.
Collier essaie de changer le monde.
C'est capital.
Je voulais avoir un rôle
dans tout ça,
et je suis certain que Danny aussi.
Danny n'en a rien à faire de Jordan,
ou de changer le monde.
Il veut prouver quelque chose.
À lui-même, ou à moi.
C'est de la jalousie.
Tu as peut-être raison,
mais on s'en fout pourquoi.
Si Danny veut prendre une dose,
personne n'a le droit
de l'en empêcher.
Je suis désolée, Tom,
mais Ryan Powell
est négatif à la promicine.
Je ne pouvais pas le retenir.
Ainsi que les clients du distributeur
et les employés de banque,
- ils sont tous négatifs.
- Impossible.
Powell est notre seul lien
entre les victimes et Ray Haugen.
Une simple coïncidence ?
Je n'en sais rien.
Mais Powell n'a pas pris de promicine,
il n'a pas d'aptitude
et ce n'est pas notre homme.
Tu as perdu un plombage ?
Ma dent...
elle est tombée.
Jed, tu n'as rien dans la main.
Du calme, du calme.
Appelez un médecin.
C'est Meghan Doyle.
Envoyez d'urgence une équipe médicale.
Je tombe en morceaux !
- Aide-moi !
- Tout va bien...
Faites venir un médecin !
Tu ne me dis pas bonjour ?
Tu allais quelque part en particulier,
ou tu ratissais la ville
en espérant me trouver ?
Où t'étais passée ?
L'école où tu vas soi-disant ?
J'y suis allé.
Ils te connaissent pas.
C'est vraiment important
l'école où je vais ?
Le plus important,
c'est que Shawn va bien.
Je me trompe ?
Comment tu savais que
la promicine allait le réveiller ?
- Qui es-tu ?
- Tu sais très bien qui je suis.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire par là ?
Hein, dis-moi ?
Tu voulais des réponses.
Je vais t'en donner.
Tu viens ?
Il m'a l'air en parfaite santé.
Crois-moi, c'est pas le cas.
Je ne comprends pas.
Vous avez passé la journée ensemble.
Oui, presque.
La banque, l'immeuble.
On s'est approchés des mêmes personnes.
C'est bizarre
qu'il soit touché et pas toi, non ?
C'était le gamin.
C'était le gamin, Diana.
Pas d'autre explication.
Quand on était dans l'appart
de Powell,
j'interrogeais la femme.
Garrity a parlé avec le fils.
Il est autiste.
Il s'est mis à crier
et à se balancer.
C'est à ce moment-là
que ça a dû se passer.
Jess, allez, dépêche-toi.
S'il te plaît !
On s'en va.
Prends quelques affaires
et on y va.
Brandon, mon garçon,
tu veux aller faire un petit tour ?
On ne va nulle part.
Dis-moi pourquoi
le NTAC en a après toi.
Ils n'en ont pas après moi.
Mais après Brandon.
Pourquoi ?
Brandon n'a rien fait de mal.
N'est-ce pas ?
Je voulais juste l'aider, je t'assure.
Jess, j'ai...
J'ai fait quelque chose.
Je pouvais pas t'en parler.
Désolé.
Tu as fait quelque chose ?
Tu lui as donné une de ces doses.
Tu lui as donné
une de ces doses ?
Espèce de pourriture !
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait à mon fils ?
Mon bébé...
Vous arrivez trop tard.
Ils sont partis.
Où sont-ils, M. Powell ?
Elle ne m'a dit pas dit
où elle l'emmenait.
On doit retrouver votre fils avant
qu'il recommence. Où sont-ils ?
Vous savez ce que c'est d'avoir un fils
qui refuse de vous...
prendre dans les bras,
de vous sourire ?
Même de vous regarder
dans les yeux ?
Personne.
D'où la dose de promicine ?
Je croyais que si Brandon
avait une capacité,
il irait mieux,
ou du moins,
que ça l'aiderait à communiquer.
Je ne sais même pas
ce que mon fils ressent
ou ce qu'il pense.
Un enfant ne peut pas vivre
comme ça. Il ne fait que...
jouer avec son fichu train.
M. Powell, réfléchissez.
Où votre femme
pourrait emmener Brandon ?
Je ne voulais pas
que ça se passe comme ça...
S'il vous plaît...
ce n'est pas de sa faute.
Il ne sait pas...
Il n'est pas conscient
de ce qu'il fait.
C'est moi, le fautif, pas lui.
Votre femme...
Elle ne savait pas pour la promicine ?
Vous rigolez, j'espère.
50/50 ?
Elle n'aurait jamais voulu.
Mais vous, vous étiez prêt
à courir le risque.
Je vois d'autres parents...
avec leurs enfants,
qui sont affectueux
et qui rigolent avec eux...
Moi aussi, je voulais ça.
Je...
Je ne cherchais pas
à tuer Brandon.
Qu'elle le comprenne bien.
Je...
Je...
Je voulais
qu'il ait une chance de...
vivre normalement.
Merci de votre coopération,
Mlle Tyler.
Nous vous contacterons prochainement.
- Faites-moi une copie des résultats.
- Quoi, c'est tout ? On a fini ?
Verdict ?
Vous m'entendez ?
Toi qui voulais des réponses, Kyle.
Tu les trouveras ici.
Tu viens ?
Vaut mieux pas.
Que savez-vous de
<i>Lumière Blanche</i> ?
À vrai dire, pas grand-chose.
Mon arrière-grand-père
a fondé notre fraternité
en 1918.
Dans ses heures de gloire,
le nombre de membres
ne dépassait pas la douzaine.
Ça n'a duré que quelques années.
Ils sont tous décédés.
Brûlés vifs dans un incendie.
En quoi croyaient ces gens ?
Ils croyaient qu'un Messie
reviendrait d'outre-tombe
et conduirait le monde
à la rédemption.
Un des côtés de la famille
dont je suis peu fier.
Mais ça intéresse des personnes,
donc je les garde avec moi.
Voici leurs textes sacrés.
et ça...
c'était le Messie
dont il attendait la venue.
On dirait bien Jordan Collier.
Vous n'êtes pas le premier...
à parler de ressemblance.
Peut-être, je ne sais pas.
Vous pouvez feuilleter le bouquin
si vous le souhaitez.
Certains chapitres,
noircis par le feu, sont illisibles,
et un est écrit dans...
une sorte de code,
ou je ne sais trop quoi.
Mais ça devrait suffire
pour comprendre l'essentiel.
C'est gentil, merci.
Pas maintenant, s'il te plaît.
Chéri, tu as faim ?
Tu veux manger ?
Non ? D'accord.
Ton train, tu veux ton train ?
Chéri, ton train est dans mon sac,
d'accord ?
Chéri, j'ai ton train avec moi.
Brandon, pas maintenant.
Je t'en supplie.
Brandon, chéri, j'ai ton train.
Allez, bon sang.
Vous les voyez ?
Ils sont partis ?
Qui, "ils" ?
Les serpents ! Ils sont là,
quelque part, j'en suis sûre.
Pitié, empêchez-les de m'approcher.
Mme Powell, calmez-vous.
Ça va aller, c'est promis.
Mme Powell, savez-vous
de quel côté votre fils est-il parti ?
Non, j'ai dû m'évanouir.
Quand j'ai ouvert les yeux,
il était parti.
Vous devez le retrouver,
s'il vous plaît.
Il est tout seul.
Il doit être effrayé.
Très bien, Mme Powell.
Si vous étiez à sa place,
à la place de Brandon,
où seriez-vous allée ?
Diana !
<i>Propriété privée
Interdiction d'entrer</i>
Petit,
tu devrais pas être chez toi ?
Où sont tes parents, fiston ?
Ils savent que t'es là ?
Ça va aller, petit.
Calme-toi.
Calme-toi !
Alors, t'en penses quoi ?
Intéressant comme bouquin, non ?
C'est pour ça que tu m'as amené ici,
pour lire ce bouquin ?
Un Messie ressuscité,
distribuant un élixir sacré
qui va changer le monde ?
Je sais, on dirait Jordan Collier,
et ce guérisseur
qui se sert de ses mains ?
Je suppose que c'est Shawn.
N'oublie pas le sorcier,
dont les visions guident le Messie
sur la voie de la lumière.
T'as pas une idée ?
C'est toi, le sorcier, Kyle.
Moi...
Je sais que ça a l'air troublant...
Troublant ?
Dingue, tu veux dire.
J'avoue,
c'est assez proche de la réalité,
Jordan, la promicine,
mais le reste est vague.
Il y a même un chapitre codé.
Et cette partie où le Messie
nous dévoilera le visage de Dieu.
"Et tous connaîtront son visage,
"et il nous sourira,
"et marchera parmi nous,
"la Terre et le Paradis
ne feront qu'un..."
Et tout ça, grâce à Collier, hein ?
Et ton aide.
C'est une prophétie, Kyle.
J'y crois pas.
Écoute,
tu m'as aidé à réveiller mon cousin
et je t'en suis reconnaissant,
mais c'est fini.
Non, Kyle, ça n'est que le début.
Cette secte,
<i>Lumière Blanche</i>,
ça existe encore, non ?
Tu es l'un d'entre eux.
Et vous voulez vous servir de Jordan
pour lancer une sorte de renouveau ?
Comptez pas sur moi.
- C'est trop tard.
- Je veux plus rien savoir.
Ne t'approche plus de moi.
Pourquoi t'as changé d'avis ?
J'ai pas changé d'avis.
Je suis toujours
contre cette idée.
C'est une erreur.
50/50, ça craint comme probabilité.
Mais t'avais raison sur une chose,
c'est ton choix
et au moins, t'auras pas de problème
en essayant de te la procurer tout seul.
Ils jettent les gens en prison,
Danny, sans procès.
J'arrive pas à comprendre.
Tu soutiens Collier depuis le début.
C'est lui qui a distribué ça.
Alors...
Si t'es pas d'accord avec ça,
qu'en est-il de vous deux ?
J'aurais voulu que
Jordan enterre tout ça quelque part.
Ces capacités causent autant
de problèmes qu'elles n'en résolvent.
Mais fais-moi plaisir,
attends un peu.
Peut-être qu'en lisant les journaux,
tu te rendras compte que le droit,
c'est pas si mal.
D'accord, j'y penserai.
Ne me regardez pas,
je vous en prie !
J'aime pas qu'on me regarde !
Je vais demander de l'aide.
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
on va vous aider.
Il va y avoir du monde ?
J'aime pas que les gens me voient.
Au moins,
Brandon nous laisse une piste à suivre.
J'ai vraiment pas
envie de l'endormir,
mais je vois pas comment faire autrement
pour le ramener au NTAC.
Je me souviens maintenant pourquoi
j'ai laissé tomber ce boulot.
Diana,
j'aimerais pouvoir faire autrement,
mais il y a trop de risques.
Si seulement Jordan Collier
n'était pas l'ennemi public nº1.
Il pourrait
lui retirer son aptitude, non ?
On ne peut pas lui retirer son aptitude,
mais on peut peut-être l'aider
à la contrôler.
Tout va bien, Brandon.
Tout ira bien.
On pourrait y aller,
s'il vous plaît ?
Il a reçu l'inhibiteur,
alors il y a peu de danger,
mais le risque subsiste.
Si vous voulez renoncer,
nous comprendrons.
C'est pas ça,
c'est juste que...
ça fait des mois
que je n'ai pas guéri quelqu'un
et l'autisme touche
au développement de la personne.
Et ça ne m'a pas vraiment réussi
jusque-là.
Mais tu vas essayer ?
Oui.
C'est bon ?
Ça a marché ?
Brandon, regarde-moi.
Pa...
Pa...
Pa...
Papa.
C'est ça.
Je suis ton papa.
C'était... incroyable.
J'avais oublié
à quel point j'aimais ça.
Regarde-toi.
Je vous laisse quelques minutes,
M. Powell,
mais ensuite, je vais devoir
vous demander de nous suivre.
Mon fils a été...
emprisonné sa vie entière.
Je suis heureux
de pouvoir prendre sa place.
Vos résultats sont arrivés.
Quoiqu'on vous ait donné
pour vous retirer vos capacités,
cela a causé une allergie définitive
à la promicine.
Si vous vous injectiez une dose,
vous ne survivriez pas.
Vous ne retrouverez jamais
vos capacités, Mlle Tyler.
Alors, je peux partir d'ici ?
Votre transfert devrait avoir lieu
d'ici deux semaines.
C'est comme ça que
vous occupez vos samedis ?
Et la plupart de mes nuits.
J'ai de bonnes nouvelles pour vous.
Les personnes touchées par Brandon
commencent à montrer
des signes d'amélioration.
C'est grâce à l'inhibiteur
qu'on lui injecte ?
Depuis que sa capacité est bridée,
leurs symptômes ont commencé
à disparaître.
Donc, Garrity devrait bientôt
être de retour.
Sauf si vous préférez
rester avec Skouris.
J'ai rien contre Jed,
mais si Diana est là,
c'est elle, ma partenaire.
Alors, que va-t-il se passer
pour Brandon ?
Tant que sa mère nous l'amène
chaque semaine
pour ses injections d'inhibiteur,
il devrait pouvoir vivre
une vie normale.
Plus normale que jusqu'à maintenant,
en tout cas.
Votre neveu a fait quelque chose
d'extraordinaire.
Les capacités de ces gens,
sont parfois bien pratiques.
Il ne faut pas l'oublier.
Alors, c'est vraiment elle ?
Alana ?
J'essaie de me convaincre
du contraire,
mais, oui, c'est elle.
Je cherche à tout prix
à la ramener.
Peut-être que
la seule chose à faire...
c'est de la laisser partir.
Il faut que je réponde.
Dr Sawyer ?
J'ai de mauvaises nouvelles.
- Votre père a fait une rechute.
- Pneumonie ?
Il n'arrive presque plus à respirer.
Il s'en est déjà sorti.
Je sais,
mais je crois qu'il est temps
de nous préparer à l'inévitable.
Je suis désolé.
Comment t'es entrée ?
Facile.
Où que tu sois, j'y suis.
Tu me harcèles maintenant,
c'est ça ?
Enfin, Kyle. Réfléchis.
Je ne fréquente pas les Beaux-Arts.
Il n'y a de traces de moi nulle part.
J'apparais quand je veux.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
T'as faim ?
J'ai pas envie de manger seul ce soir.
Papa, je voudrais te présenter Cassie.
Qui est-ce ?
Quelqu'un que tu as rencontré
au travail ?
Tu t'es déjà trouvé une copine ?
Ce serait un peu gênant.
Vous voyez,
je ne suis pas vraiment réelle.
Je suis la capacité de Kyle.
Je voulais pas être indiscret,
désolé.
Tu devrais l'emmener
un de ces quatre.
Alors, c'est bon pour le dîner ?
Laisse-moi deux minutes, d'accord ?
Bien sûr, super.

<i>v1.01</i>
<i>SeriesSub</i> presents...
The world will have to
deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...
These shots are free.
Give them to anyone
who wants them,
but be careful
to explain the risks.
I couldn't save her.
There are no guarantees.
There never are.
Cassie... Dunlevy.
Maybe I'll see you around.
You ever go visit
your cousin, Shawn?
Is he getting any better?
Maybe someone should try injecting him
with a big old dose of promicin.
It'd be like giving him
a jump start, right?
Ever since the 4400 came back,
it's been one sacrifice
after another.
It has to stop.
It worked, right?
I'm not dead.
Not this time, no.
Next time,
you might not be so fortunate.
They told you to kill me.
You didn't do it.
You ever think maybe
that's why your girlfriend is gone?
I know you've been looking
for Alana for three months.
You must have considered the possibility
that she was abducted again.
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't see you there.
Excuse me,
how did you get in here?
I don't understand.
This is too weird.
I'm getting off.
Excuse me.
I need to get out of here.
I need to get out of here.
No, please...
No, I can't handle tight spaces!
I can't breathe!
I got to get out of here!
Get me out of here, please,
I can't breathe!
Help me, I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
Help me, please, I can't...
I can't...
Leave me alone!
He's...
He's going to kill me!
Leave me alone!
Stop, please!
Leave me alone!
- Hey...
- Hello, Tom.
I heard about your sister.
I figured you might be showing up.
- Ben and Maia with you?
- No, they're in spain,
which is where I'll be as soon as
I figure out what happened to april.
You working any leads?
No one's seen
or spoken to her in months.
I don't even know
if she's alive or dead.
Just because she got her hands
on a promicin shot,
- doesn't mean she took it.
- This is April we're talking about.
If she got the shot,
she took it.
Look...
if there's anything I can do,
anything you need,
you just say the word.
Actually,
I was hoping you could tell me
a little bit about your new boss.
Meghan Doyle?
She's young, inexperienced,
think-tank smart. Spends a lot of time
in the theory room. Why?
I was thinking about asking
for temporary reinstatement.
Just hoping access
to NTAC's resources
will speed up my search.
I'm not sure she'll go for
the temporary assignment.
Then I guess I'll just have to tell her
that I'm back for good.
So you're going to lie?
This is my sister.
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'm so sorry for
dumping all this on you.
Because I know you've got other things
on your mind. Any news on Alana?
I have to admit that the resemblance
is striking,
and there's nothing about her
in any of these art books?
All I know is that from june
to september, 1885,
Claude Pierrot painted six portraits
of a woman named Alana.
Who she was,
what happened to her afterwards,
is all a blank, but that...
That's her, Diana,
that's Alana.
You think they sent her
back into the past
as some kind of punishment
for you not killing Isabelle?
I think the future gave her to me
and the future took her away.
I guess there's no way
of ever finding out.
Maybe there is.
I know how to contact the future,
I've done it before.
Please, tell me you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.
I will always be grateful for you
for getting Maia back,
but you attempted suicide.
The only reason they saved you last time
was because they needed you.
That's not the case this time.
It's been three months.
I don't know what else to do.
Wherever Alana is,
whatever happened to her,
she does not want you dead.
Yeah. Baldwin.
Don't let them get me!
Please,
they're going to kill me!
What you're looking at
is a highly elevated fear response.
In Mr. Kopelow's case,
it's a fear of clowns.
But to have that kind of reaction,
doesn't there need to be...
You know,
actual clowns?
That's what makes these cases
so unusual.
There's no
external stimuli present.
How many cases
are we talking about?
Eight in the last two hours,
which is why I called you.
We all have things
that we're afraid of...
insects, heights,
but we learn how to cope with them.
In these people,
those coping mechanisms are turned off.
They've seen their worst fears
come to life.
And you think
a 4400 ability's behind this?
Someone or something
is turning their...
preexisting fears
into unmanageable phobias.
- Excuse me.
- Well, eight cases in two hours.
I'd say someone's been
pretty busy.
For all we know,
they're just getting started.

You think one of my employees
drove those people crazy?
All we know is that
5 of our 8 victims
had receipts
from your branch's ATM.
According to the transaction slips,
they all used the machine
some time between 7:12 and 7:28
this morning.
The bank isn't even
open then.
That means no one on my staff
is responsible, right?
We're still going to need everyone
to submit to a promicin test,
just to be sure.
Look at this.
Max Kopelow.
And look who's right behind him
in line... Jacqui Glendon.
Our claustrophobia victim.
Check this out. There's no audio,
but looks like there's
some kind of commotion just outside
of camera range, right there.
- What do you think?
- We'll need a list of
everyone who used
that ATM this morning.
- I can get you that.
- Great.
Hey, sleeping beauty.
How does it feel to be awake?
It feels
pretty good.
They're kicking me
out of here today.
You going home?
That's fantastic.
It'll make those media hounds
outside very happy.
I might disappoint them
and sneak out the back.
I don't know.
I cannot believe how much catching up
I have to do.
So much...
crazy stuff has happened
the last three months.
Change is painful.
It comes with a cost.
You're quoting
Jordan Collier now?
You say that
like it's a bad thing.
I didn't think
he'd go through with it,
hand out all the promicin?
He knew what would happen.
He knew it would kill
all of those people.
And I feel bad for those people,
but I've seen promicin
do some amazing things.
I guess I should be
thanking you, huh?
- For what?
- Come on, Kyle.
I overheard the doctors talking.
They said that there was some kind of
spike in my promicin level,
and that's what woke me up,
and it was you and my mom
in the room when it happened,
and I kind of doubt...
That my mom
could get her hands on a shot.
It had been three months, man.
The doctors weren't sure
you were ever going to wake up.
Somebody had to try something.
What about your dad?
He's going to figure out it was you.
Probably.
San Sebastian is one of the most
beautiful cities in the world,
and that view of the bay at night...
It's pretty spectacular.
Which is why if I dropped
everything and moved there
with my daughter and boyfriend,
I might find it a little hard
to give up.
Well, it wasn't
an easy decision.
No, but knowing
the separation was only temporary,
must have made it easier.
I'm not really sure
how long I'll be staying.
It could be quite some time.
At least
until you find your sister.
Look, Diana,
I know you've been trying to track April
on your own and you've hit a brick wall.
But you flash an NTAC badge,
it's amazing how fast
those walls come down.
It's clear what you get
out of this arrangement, but...
but what's my win?
Me.
I'm your win.
Temporary or not, you could use
another experienced agent here.
That's pretty much
what your former partner, Tom, said.
Smart guy.
you should listen to him.
Let me ask you a question.
Have you ever seen
<i>La Dolce Vita</i>?
Dubbed or subtitled?
Do I look like I watch
dubbed movies?
Do I?
Welcome back, agent Skouris.
I'm being reinstated
because I like foreign films?
Of course not,
but it doesn't hurt your cause.
Transferring me?
Where?
It's a brand-new facility
for people who've
developed abilities
that the government
considers non-threatening.
They're...
kept on the inhibitor,
but otherwise, it's...
less like a prison,
and more like a...
An internment camp?
There's an exercise yard,
a library that you can use,
and, of course, you'll be allowed
to interact with the other inmates.
Sounds nice.
Nicer than this place, anyway.
Then we'll arrange
for your transfer.
But first,
we need you to sign this.
It's a consent form,
giving us permission
to test your tolerance for promicin.
You want to see if I can get
my abilities back?
We want to make absolutely sure
that you can't.
The substance that your father injected
you with negated your abilities,
but before we can move you
to another facility,
we need to be positive
that they're never coming back.
What if they do?
What then?
We're prepared to deal with
that contingency as well.
This morning,
when you were in line at the ATM,
- do you rember seeing this man?
- I wasn't really paying any attention.
I was on a business call.
Does NTAC cover
your life insurance?
Did you notice anything unusual
while you were there?
Anyone's behavior
strike you as odd?
There was this one guy.
I think he was complaining
about the line. How long it was taking.
What did he say exactly?
He was yapping
about the bank being too cheap
to spring for another ATM.
He's right about that,
by the way.
What did he look like?
20-something. He was wearing
kind of like a baseball cap.
He was just a regular guy.
When do you ever notice people at banks?
Unless they're robbing
the place, right?
We got a no-show.
Thank you.
Mr. Kennedy!
I'm agent Garrity, NTAC.
Stop!
Okay, stairs.
I made up
your old room for you.
Danny, why don't you
take your brother upstairs
while I make
some lunch?
How does
a tuna melt sound?
That's my favorite.
All right...
Come on, Troy,
talk to us.
Why did you attack
those people, huh?
You got a problem with
Columbia fidelity bank, huh?
Or maybe you did it
for a laugh.
You think screwing with people's heads
is funny? Is that it ?
No, look, I admit I took promicin.
I lost my job, I couldn't pay off
my credit cards,
my girlfriend dumped me.
I...
I was desperate.
I took the shot
to make my life better.
Better, better.
better how, huh?
By driving
a bunch of people crazy?
They're at Abendson
psychiatric hospital,
writhing around
in strait-jackets.
It wasn't me, I swear.
My ability's harmless.
I play music.
I pick up any instrument,
and I'm like a virtuoso.
Really?
Well, I'll go home
and get my clarinet.
Guys...
Can you step out for a sec?
I just got off the phone with
the seattle P.D. There's been another...
I don't even know what
to call them, phobia attack?
- Pretty much says it.
- Anyway, a 911 call came in,
10 minutes ago from an apartment
over on lakemont.
Seems the building manager
has been screaming like a madman
about how the place
is covered in germs.
We've had kennedy in custody
for hours.
Then he's not our guy,
which means whoever's doing this
is still out there.
Great.
All right.
When do you have to get
the applications in?
I've got another
month or so,
that's even
if I apply.
What do you mean "if?"
I thought that you were going to be
the next Clarence Darrow.
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but now,
with everything that's going on,
the world's a different place.
You know, law school
just seems so meaningless.
Just because world's changed
doesn't mean that you have to.
Well, maybe I want to.
The world's made up
of two different classes now.
You got people with abilities,
who are capable of amazing things,
people like you,
and then you got the regular schmucks,
who just have to...
deal with the fact they're a little less
special than they could be.
You know...
I've been thinking about it
a lot, and...
I want to take
the promicin shot.
Those shots are killing people.
I know all about the risks.
I think they're worth it.
They're not worth it, not when you have
as much to live for as you do.
Think about the odds, okay?
There's a 50-50 chance
that you would be
committing suicide.
What are you really
afraid of, Shawn?
Me dying,
or me getting an ability?
Cause that'd put us on equal
footing, we can't have that.
- This isn't about you and me.
- It's always about you and me!
I thought  you'd be
excited about this.
I thought you'd be supportive,
but I guess I was wrong.
- Please, listen...
- Shawn. I'm glad that you're back
I really am, but I'm not asking
for your permission.
The stuff is out there, and I'll get it,
with or without your help.
I have to clean.
I haven't finished.
I haven't finished.
I've got to clean.
The germs are everywhere.
Just stop...
don't touch me.
What happened
to his hands?
Paramedics found him scrubbing them
with a brillo pad.
Well, I just checked his apartment.
According to his records,
this guy banks at Washington Prime,
- and not columbia fidelity.
- So this is a separate incident
from the one at the bank.
Or maybe he knows the victim
in some other way.
Let's canvass the building,
talk to the tenants,
- see if we can find a link.
- Right.
Can I help you?
So is this about Ray?
I saw him being loaded
into an ambulance.
Did you see him before that?
Maybe earlier this morning?
No, but my husband did.
Our bathroom faucet's
been leaking for a week,
and Ray still hasn't gotten around
to fixing it.
What time do you expect
your husband home?
Why?
It's not like they had a fight
or anything.
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to play with trains, too.
- Just like...
- Don't worry, it's not your fault.
Brandon's autistic.
He likes things in a certain order.
There we go. See?
It's okay.
Excuse me?
- Is this your husband?
- Yeah, that's Ryan.
Why?
Isn't he one of the guys
from the ATM line?
I think we found our link.
You want me
to talk to Danny?
You might be able
to talk some sense into him,
convince him that he'd be,
you know, crazy to take that shot.
I can't do that, Shawn.
If Danny wants to take promicin,
I say, give it to him.
Kyle, this isn't just
some guy on the street
with nothing to lose.
This is my little brother.
That shot could kill him.
It didn't kill me.
You took promicin?
Kyle, you took
promicin?
Three months ago.
My hand was shaking so bad,
I could barely hold the syringe,
but I survived.
I didn't get an ability, but...
I survived.
Since when do you care about
getting an ability so much?
It's not just about getting an ability,
it's about making a difference.
What Collier's trying to do, change
this world, man? That's important.
I wanted to be
a part of that,
and I bet Danny feels
the same way.
Kyle, I don't think
that Danny cares about Jordan,
or changing the world. He's trying
to prove something to himself,
or to me.
It's a jealousy thing.
That may be true,
but the reason doesn't matter.
If Danny wants to take the shot,
I don't think you or anyone else
has a right to stop him.
I'm sorry, Tom,
but Ryan Powell
tested negative for promicin.
I had no choice
but to release him.
Same with
the ATM customers
and the bank employees,
they all came back clean.
That can't be right. Powell's our
only link between the bank victims
and Ray Haugen. You're telling me
that's just a coincidence?
I don't know what it is.
But Ryan Powell didn't take promicin,
he doesn't have an ability,
and he's not the guy we're looking for.
Did you lose a filling
or something?
My tooth...
It just fell out.
Jed, there's nothing
in your hand.
Just calm down,
calm down.
Get somebody in here.
This is Meghan Doyle. I need
a medical team up here right away.
I'm coming apart!
- Don't let me die!
- It's okay...
Somebody, get in here!
Aren't you going
to say hello?
You headed some place
in particular,
or were you combing the city
hoping to find me.
Where have you been, huh?
That school you said
you were going to?
I went there.
They never heard of you.
Does it really matter
where I go to school?
The important thing is
Shawn's okay.
He is, isn't he?
How'd you know
the promicin would wake him up?
- Who are you?
- Come on, I think you know that.
What's that
supposed to mean?
Huh, what's that
supposed to mean?
You said
you wanted answers.
I'll take you
to them.
Are you coming or not?
He looks fine to me.
Oh, trust me, he's not.
Well, I don't understand.
You've been together all day.
Yeah, pretty much.
The bank, the apartment building.
We had contact with the same people.
That's a bit odd, isn't it?
That he would be affected
and not you?
It was that kid.
It was that kid, Diana.
It has to be.
When we were at
Ryan Powell's apartment,
I was interviewing the wife.
Garrity spoke to the son.
He's autistic.
He started screaming at him
and rocking back and forth.
That's when it happened.
It has to be.
Jess, come on. Come on.
Come on, please!
Just... let's get out of here.
Just throw some stuff together
and let's go.
Brandon what do you say buddy?
Wanna go on a little road trip?
We're not going anywhere.
Just tell me
why NTAC is after you.
It's not me they're after.
It's Brandon.
Why?
Brandon hasn't done
anything wrong.
Has he?
I swear, I was only
trying to help him.
Okay, Jess, just I...
I did... something.
I couldn't tell you.
I'm sorry.
You did something?
You gave him one of those shots.
You gave him
one of those shots?
You bastard!
What did you do to my son?
Baby...
You're too late.
They're gone.
Where are they, Mr. Powell?
I don't know where Jess is taking him.
She didn't tell me.
We need to find your son before
he hurts anyone else. Where are they ?
Do you know what it's like
to have a... son who won't...
hug you, or smile at you?
Won't even...
Won't even look you in the eye?
Clear.
Is that why you gave him
promicin?
I thought if Brandon
got an ability,
it would make him better,
at least help him
to communicate.
I don't even know
what my own son is thinking,
or feeling, you know?
That's no way for a kid to live.
All he does is...
play with that goddamn train.
Mr. Powell, we're going
to need you to think.
Where would your wife
have taken Brandon?
Look, I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.
Please...
Please none of this is his fault.
He doesn't know.
He has no idea what he's doing.
If anybody's to blame, it's me.
So your wife...
She didn't know you injected him?
Are you kidding me?
50-50?
She'd never agree to that.
But you were willing
to take the risk.
I see other parents...
with their own kids,
and the warmth,
and the joking around...
I wanted some of that.
I...
I wasn't trying to kill Brandon.
She has to believe that.
I just...
I just...
I just wanted him
to have the chance at a...
at a normal life.
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mrs. Tyler.
We'll be in contact shortly.
- Get me a copy of the lab report.
- Is that all? We're done?
Did I pass?
Hello!
Well, you wanted answers, Kyle.
You'll find them in there.
Are you
coming with me?
It's better if I don't.
What do you know
about white light?
Not too much, actually.
My great-grandfather
founded the group
back in 1918.
Even at its height,
the membership never exceeded
a few dozen people.
The whole thing only
lasted a few years.
They all died.
Burned to death in a fire.
What did
these people believe?
They believed that a messiah
would return from the dead
and lead the world
to salvation.
Not the proudest branch
on my family tree.
But people are interested
in this stuff,
so I keep it around.
This was their scripture,
and this...
was the messiah
they were waiting for.
Yeah, that looks like
Jordan Collier.
You're not the first person to...
mention a resemblance.
I don't know, maybe.
Feel free to...
thumb through the book
if you'd like.
A few of the chapters
are too charred to read,
and one of them
is written in a...
Oh, I don't know,
a code or something,
but there's enough for you
to get the gist.
That's great, thank you.
Oh, Brandon...
Please, not now, okay?
Um... are you hungry, honey?
Do you want a snack?
Uh.. No? Okay.
Uh... how about your train?
You want your train?
I got your train right here,
sweetie, okay?
Honey,
I've got your train over here.
Brandon, please not now.
XX, mommy.
Brandon, I've got your train, sweetie.
Come on, come on.
Do you see them?
are they gone?
Is what gone?
The snakes! They're here
somewhere, I know it.
Don't let them get me, please!
Mrs. Powell, just calm down.
Everything'll be okay, I promise.
Did you see the direction
your son was headed,
Mrs. Powell?
No, I must've blacked out.
When I opened my eyes,
he was gone.
You have to find him.
Please you have to find him.
He's out there all alone.
He must be so scared!
All right, Mrs. Powell.
If you were Brandon,
if you were your son,
where would you go?
Hey, Diana!
Hey, kid, shouldn't you be at home?
Where are your parents, bud?
Do they know you're out here?
Whoa, buddy.
Take it easy.
Take it easy!
So, what did you think?
Pretty interesting reading, huh?
That's why you brought me here,
to read that book?
A messiah who rises from the dead,
who passes out a sacred elixir
that changes the world?
I know that sounds
just like Jordan Collier,
and that healer who lays
his hands upon the sick?
I'm guessing
that's supposed to be Shawn.
Don't forget about the shaman,
whose visions guide the messiah
down the path to enlightenment.
Want to take a stab
at who that is?
The shaman is you, Kyle.
Me...
I know it might sound
a little intimidating...
Intimidating? Try insane.
All right, I admit that book
got few things right,
about Jordan, about promicin,
but the rest of it's kind of vague,
there's that whole
chapter that's in code.
What about the part that says,
the messiah
will show us
the face of god?
"And all will know his face,
"and he will smile down upon us
"and walk among us,
"and the earth and heaven
will be as one..."
And Collier's gonna make
that happen, huh?
With your help.
It's a prophecy, Kyle.
I don't believe that.
Look, you helped me
wake up my cousin.
For that, I am grateful,
but this is over.
No, Kyle, it's just beginning.
Look, this cult, "white light"
it's still around, isn't it?
You're one of them.
You're trying to use Jordan to start
some kind of crazy religious revival?
I won't be a part of that.
- You already are...
- I don't want to hear anymore.
Just stay the hell away from me.
What changed your mind?
Nothing changed my mind.
I don't agree
with taking promicin.
I think it's a mistake.
50-50, those are lousy odds.
But you were right about
one thing, it's your decision,
and I don't want you getting arrested
trying to find the stuff yourself.
They're throwing people
in jail, Danny, no trial.
I don't get it.
You were with Collier
from the beginning.
He put this out there.
I mean...
if you don't agree with it,
where does that leave
you and him?
I wish Jordan
had buried that stuff somewhere.
These abilities cause
as many problems as they solve.
Just do me a favor, okay,
and just hold off for a while.
Maybe if you read the paper
for the next few weeks,
law school won't seem so bad.
Yeah, okay.
I can do that.
Please, don't look at me!
I don't like people
looking at me!
Okay, I'm going to call this in.
Don't worry, sir,
we're gonna get you help.
Are there going to be
people there?
I don't like
people seeing me.
At least Brandon's
giving us a trail to follow.
I hate that
we have to sedate him,
but I don't know how else
to get him back into NTAC.
I'm starting to remember why
I gave this job up in the first place.
Diana, I wish
there was another way,
but his ability's
too much of a threat.
If only Jordan Collier wasn't
the most wanted man in the world.
He could take his ability away,
couldn't he?
We can't cure him
of his ability,
but maybe there's a way
we can help him control it.
It's okay, Brandon.
Everything's going to be okay.
Can we just do this, please?
He's been given the inhibitor,
so hopefully there won't
be any kind of danger,
but there's still
some risk involved.
So if you want to back out,
we'd understand.
It's not that,
it's just...
I haven't healed anyone
in months,
and autism is developmental.
I haven't had a lot of success
with that in the past.
But you will try?
Yeah.
Is that it?
Did it work?
Brandon?
Brandon, look at me.
Da...
Da...
Da...
Dad.
That's right.
I'm your dad.
That... That was incredible.
I forgot how much I liked this.
Look at you.
I can give you
a few minutes, Mr. Powell,
but then I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with us.
My son has been...
in a prison his entire life.
I'm happy
to trade places with him.
Your test results came back.
Whatever you were given
to take away your abilities,
it induced a permanent allergy
to promicin.
if you were to take the shot,
it would be fatal.
You will never get
your abilities back, Miss Tyler.
Does that mean
I'm getting out of here?
The transfer should take place
within two weeks.
Does this how you spend
your saturdays?
Most nights, too.
I thought you might want to hear
some good news.
Dr. Clayton says
the people Brandon affected,
they're beginning to show
signs of improvement.
You think putting him on the inhibitor
had something to do with it?
As soon as we muted his ability,
their symptoms
began to dissipate,
which means Garrity should be
back in rotation soon.
Unless you'd prefer
to stick with Skouris.
Look, nothing against jed,
but if Diana's gonna be around,
she's my partner.
So what happens to Brandon now?
As long as his mother brings him in
for weekly injections
of the inhibitor,
he should be able to live
a fairly normal life...
More normal than he has
up to now anyway.
That was an amazing thing
your nephew did.
Yeah, these abilities
people get,
they come in handy sometimes.
It's worth remembering.
So is it really her?
Alana?
I keep trying
to convince myself it's not,
but, yeah, it's her,
and all I can think about
is how do I get her back.
Maybe all you can do is...
let her go.
I really need to take this.
Dr. Sawyer?
The news isn't good.
- Your father's had a relapse.
- Pneumonia?
His breathing's been
severely compromised.
He's beaten this before.
I know, but I think it's time
we start preparing ourselves
for the inevitable.
I'm sorry.
How did you get in here?
It was easy.
Where you go, I go.
You're stalking me now, is that it?
Come on, Kyle, think.
I don't go to the art institute.
There's no record
of me anywhere.
I show up wherever I want to.
What does that tell you?
You up for some dinner?
I don't feel like
eating alone tonight.
Dad, I want you to meet Cassie.
Who's Cassie?
Is she someone you met at work?
You find yourself
a girlfriend already?
Well, that would be
a little bit awkward.
See, I'm not
what you'd call real.
I'm Kyle's ability.
Hey, I... I don't mean to pry.
Sorry.
You should bring her
by the house some time.
So... we on for dinner?
Yeah. Yeah, just give me
a couple of minutes, okay?
Yeah. Great.

4400 avaient disparu
4400 sont revenus
Tous possèdent une aptitude unique
L'un d'entre eux porte un message
Quiconque peut devenir exceptionnel
Le risque est immense
À la hauteur des bienfaits
C'est irréversible
Le monde devra nous accepter.
<i>Précédemment dans</i> Les 4400...
Voici la nouvelle directrice
du NTAC.
- Meghan Doyle.
- Bonjour.
Mauvaises nouvelles.
Votre père a fait une rechute.
Je crois qu'il est temps
de nous préparer à l'inévitable.
- <i>Qui est Cassie ?</i>
- <i>Je ne suis pas vraiment réelle.</i>
Je suis la capacité de Kyle.
<i>Un Messie ressuscité,
distribuant un élixir sacré.</i>
Et ce guérisseur,
qui se sert de ses mains ?
N'oublie pas le sorcier.
C'est toi, le sorcier, Kyle.
Bien sûr, Heather Tobey...
J'enseigne ici, maintenant.
<i>J'ai finalement trouvé un endroit
où une 4400 est la bienvenue.</i>
Quoiqu'on vous ait donné
pour retirer vos capacités,
cela a causé une allergie définitive
à la promicine.
Vous ne retrouverez jamais
vos capacités, Mlle Tyler.
Alors, je peux partir d'ici ?
- <i>L'un des noms était April Skouris.</i>
- Ma soeur a pris des doses ?
Tu vas retourner à Seattle.
J'envisageais de demander
ma réintégration temporaire.
Elle ne reviendra pas.
Pour ma soeur,
je suis prête à tout.
<i>Au premier abord,
mon histoire peut paraître banale.</i>
<i>Une vie entière
vécue dans les apparences,</i>
<i>l'insouciance d'une jeunesse
oubliant qu'elle n'est pas éternelle.</i>
Je vais le ramasser.
Vous avez dû briser de nombreux coeurs
à cette époque, Mlle Parker.
St. Tropez.
Août 1955.
Le propriétaire du yacht
m'avait demandée en mariage.
J'ai refusé.
Vous avez toujours refusé...
Êtes-vous prête
pour votre injection de morphine ?
Votre dîner
est dans le réfrigérateur,
et je vous ai préparé
une autre seringue
si votre main
vous fait à nouveau souffrir.
M'man ?
On devait rester que 15 minutes.
Je vais être à la bourre.
J'en ai pour une minute, Lucas.
T'as voulu que je prenne ce boulot.
S'ils me virent, ça sera de ta faute.
Je peux encore vous être utile ?
- Vous pourriez ?
- Bien sûr.
<i>Pour finir, il ne me restait
que quelques souvenirs frivoles,</i>
<i>sans personne
avec qui les partager.</i>
Et voilà.
Vous êtes magnifique.
<i>Ma vie n'était plus qu'une longue suite
de journées ennuyeuses et inutiles.</i>
<i>Jusqu'à ce que je décide
d'y remédier.</i>
<i>Je me suis fait une injection...</i>
<i>de promicine.</i>
<i>Et tout a changé.</i>
<i>Mon âme, ma conscience,</i>
<i>peu importe le nom
que vous lui donnez,</i>
<i>peut quitter mon corps.</i>
<i>Je peux quitter mon corps,</i>
<i>et être jeune à nouveau.</i>
<i>Vous ne pouvez
ni m'entendre, ni me voir,</i>
<i>mais je suis là.</i>
<i>D'un battement de cil,
je peux aller n'importe où,</i>
<i>voir n'importe quoi,
ou n'importe qui,</i>
<i>comme cette jeune femme, sur le point
de découvrir l'immensité de son talent.</i>
Ah, tu es là.
Vanessa, ne te cache pas comme ça.
Tout le monde
veut rencontrer l'artiste.
Et s'ils ne l'aiment pas ?
Et s'ils ne m'aiment pas ?
Tu plaisantes, non ?
Tu as déjà vendu 5 tableaux.
C'est un vrai succès.
Viens.
Mesdames et Messieurs,
Vanessa Martin !
<i>Cette capacité</i>
<i>a réellement rendu
un sens à ma vie.</i>
<i>Je me sens enfin libre, et...</i>
<i>je reprends contact
avec le monde qui m'entoure,</i>
<i>avec les autres.</i>
<i>Je suis comme
une mouche sur le mur,</i>
<i>et je peux percevoir la face cachée
que les gens veulent tenir secrète.</i>
Oui, je suis l'agent de Vanessa.
Je ne cherche pas à me faire valoir.
C'est elle, l'artiste. Mais...
Je l'ai bien aidée
pour en arriver là.
Je peux peut-être vous aider.
J'aimerais voir votre travail,
particulièrement les nus.
<i>Je pensais passer
le restant de ma vie</i>
<i>à me morfondre
dans d'amers regrets,</i>
<i>et dans le désespoir.</i>
<i>Au lieu de cela,
la vie m'offrait une seconde chance,</i>
<i>et j'avais la ferme intention
d'en tirer le meilleur parti possible.</i>
<i>Cette injection m'avait procuré
une nouvelle raison de vivre,</i>
<i>un don me permettant
de faire et de sentir des choses,</i>
<i>une expérience unique,
jamais réalisée auparavant.</i>
<i>Et pourtant, le gouvernement s'acharne
à diaboliser la promicine...</i>
... "à dissuader les gens
d'en prendre.
"Vous qui me lisez,
"je tiens à vous dire
le bien que j'en ai retiré.
"En ce qui me concerne...
tout a changé.
"Cela pourrait être le cas
pour vous, également."
C'est le dernier article.
Quel que soit l'auteur,
le blog reste anonyme.
Dès qu'on le ferme,
il ressurgit ailleurs.
Il faut avouer
que c'est bien écrit.
Si jamais j'hésitais,
et que je lisais ça...
je crois que j'en prendrais.
C'est exactement pour ça
que ce journal rend Washington nerveux.
L'auteure n'a pas l'air
d'une extrémiste.
Elle parle plutôt...
comme à des amis.
Et si une amie espère acquérir
une capacité, pourquoi pas vous ?
Si on admet que cette femme a bien
les capacités qu'elle décrit...
OK, c'est peut-être irresponsable
de sa part de l'écrire,
mais elle est inoffensive.
En quoi ça nous concerne ?
On traque les criminels,
pas ceux qui rêvent de voyage.
Prendre de la promicine
est illégal.
Et voire,
potentiellement mortel.
Si ce blog influence 20 personnes,
et qu'ils en prennent,
10 d'entre elles vont mourir.
N'oubliez pas
ceux qui vont survivre.
Vous pensez
qu'ils seront tous inoffensifs ?
Que leurs capacités seront
aussi bénignes que la sienne ?
Il faut arrêter cette femme.
On saura quelles sont réellement
ses intentions,
dès que vous l'aurez trouvée.
- Ramenez-la.
- Je prends l'équipement antiémeute.
Prends les gaz lacrymo.

La bibliothèque,
un endroit idéal
pour les activités subversives.
Attention à ce que tu dis, Tom.
Si ça se trouve,
ils font tous partie du complot.
Excusez-moi.
Tom Baldwin,
voici ma partenaire, Diana Skouris.
- Nous sommes du NTAC.
- NTAC ?
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Quelqu'un diffuse sur Internet
des infos illégales.
D'après l'adresse IP,
l'ordinateur se trouve ici.
Selon le responsable, vous êtes
la bénévole en charge des ordinateurs ?
Tout à fait.
Nous recherchons un envoi
effectué hier vers 11h15.
Est-il possible de...
savoir qui utilisait les ordinateurs
à ce moment ?
Auriez-vous un mandat de quelque sorte,
ou seulement vos badges ?
Pas de mandat...
pour l'instant.
Nous espérions votre coopération.
Il s'agit d'une enquête très importante.
Mademoiselle...
Parker.
Et si je ne craignais pas
que cela nous pose des problèmes,
je ne vous donnerais
aucune information.
N'y a-t-il plus de respect
pour la vie privée ?
Je comprends vos hésitations,
Mlle Parker,
mais nous essayons
de protéger les gens, c'est tout.
Voilà...
Les noms,
les heures de connexions,
et les numéros d'inscription.
- Bonne chasse.
- Merci.
"Quiconque sacrifie
sa liberté pour plus de sécurité
"ne mérite ni l'un ni l'autre,
et n'aura aucun des deux."
Benjamin Franklin.
Au moins,
vous êtes un despote instruit.
Merci pour tout.
James s'en sort bien jusque-là.
S'il suit
les 10 semaines du programme,
je suis sûre qu'il améliorera
sa concentration.
Merci.
Il n'y a pas grand-chose à dire.
Quand le centre des 4400 a fermé,
je n'ai pu faire
que du volontariat
dans cette clinique pour enfants.
C'est pas mal.
Ça occupe.
Mais si je me sers de mes capacités,
si j'exploite le talent de ces gamins,
j'irai droit en prison.
C'est dingue.
Je sais.
Jordan a distribué les doses et
nous sommes tous devenus des menaces.
Depuis mon réveil à l'hôpital,
je me demande...
"Qu'est-ce que sont censés faire
les 4400,
"la révolution ?"
Ça, ou... se comporter comme si
nous n'étions pas différents des autres.
C'est l'époque qui veut ça,
je pense.
Non, écoute,
je peux pas accepter ça.
Je voudrais recommencer
à soigner les gens.
Peut-être même rouvrir le centre.
Je financerai tout moi-même,
pour commencer.
Quelqu'un doit montrer au monde
qu'on est...
qu'on est du bon côté.
Que nous sommes bons.
Je peux guérir les gens,
et toi, tu fais évoluer les enfants.
Tu développes leurs dons,
tu changes leurs vies.
Il n'y a rien de mal à cela.
Si tu refais ça au grand jour,
le gouvernement viendra t'arrêter.
- Peut-être.
- Ils le devront.
Peut-être. Je me disais...
J'espérais juste
ne pas avoir à le faire seul.
Salut, Kyle.
Désolée,
je ne voulais pas t'effrayer.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
T'es quoi, au juste ?
Je sais que tu n'es pas réelle,
que tu vis dans mes pensées.
Considère-moi comme ton guide.
Et maintenant, tu dois retourner
à cette maison sur Barclay Court,
- pour le livre.
- Pourquoi ?
Je l'ai déjà lu. C'est écrit
que Collier est censé être...
le messager de Dieu.
Je suis une sorte de sorcier.
- C'est dingue.
- Tu as lu le livre,
mais tu n'y crois pas encore.
Pour ça,
tu dois l'étudier de plus près.
Te l'approprier.
Dis-moi un truc...
Si je ne suis pas tes conseils,
tu vas continuer à apparaître ?
Kyle, tu as pris cette dose
pour une bonne raison.
Tu voulais qu'il arrive quelque chose.
Eh bien, me voilà.
Je suis ton aptitude.
Et je te demande d'aller voir ce livre.
Tout en sera changé.
Philip Delacroix ?
J'espérais vous rencontrer.
On se connaît ?
Non, mais nous avons
un intérêt commun.
Vanessa Martin.
C'est une artiste très talentueuse,
n'est-ce pas ?
Oui, bien sûr.
"Delacroix"...
C'est bon choix
pour un nom d'agent.
Il s'en dégage
une sorte de parfum exotique.
Pensez-vous
que Vanessa apprécierait
si je lui apprenais
que votre vrai nom
est Philip Wilson ?
Que vous vous faisiez passer pour
un agent immobilier à Arlington, Texas,
pour soutirer à des couples âgés
leurs économies pour leur retraite.
Qu'il y a un mandat d'arrêt
à votre nom au Texas,
ainsi qu'en Floride ?
Je pense qu'elle vous prendrait
pour une folle.
Vanessa me fait confiance.
Bien sûr, mais vous comptez
là-dessus, justement, non ?
Dites-moi, qu'allez-vous faire,
la convaincre de vous laisser
gérer sa fortune,
et tout abandonner...
après l'avoir saignée à blanc ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Quelqu'un qui désire
s'assurer de l'avenir de Vanessa.
À son âge,
je m'intéressais à l'art également,
mais je n'avais pas le talent
de Vanessa,
alors, j'ai bien l'intention...
de m'assurer qu'elle aura les moyens
d'en tirer profit au mieux.
Pour cela,
elle doit être débarrassée
de vous.
Alors, vous avez le choix,
M. Wilson.
Laisser Vanessa tranquille,
et vous éloigner de Seattle...
définitivement,
ou rester...
et je vous dénoncerai
à la police.
On a interrogé tous ceux figurant
sur le relevé de connexions.
On attend les résultats
des tests de promicine,
mais je ne crois pas
que l'un d'eux...
soit le rédacteur.
On regardera tous les articles demain,
pour voir si quelque chose cloche.
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui, très bien.
Merci pour les infos.
En fait...
il y a bien quelque chose.
En rentrant du lycée,
un jour de Noël,
j'ai tout de suite senti que
mon père n'allait pas très bien.
Il avait des... tremblements,
d'étranges tics nerveux.
On a diagnostiqué
la maladie de Huntington,
un mois plus tard.
- Désolé, c'est terrible.
- C'était...
il y a une dizaine d'années.
Son docteur vient de m'apprendre
qu'il avait une pneumonie... à nouveau.
Dieu sait
s'il arrivera à la combattre.
J'ai appelé Washington ce matin.
Je leur ai demandé si...
éventuellement...
si je pouvais convaincre
votre neveu, Shawn, de le voir,
peut-être qu'il pourrait le guérir.
Shawn est un type généreux.
Il sera d'accord.
Ils ont refusé.
En tant que directrice, je dois
montrer l'exemple. Je ne peux pas...
bénéficier à titre personnel
des capacités d'un 4400.
Mon père est mourant
depuis 10 ans.
Il n'y a aucun remède.
Et j'ai rencontré votre neveu.
Si vous voulez que je parle à Shawn,
je le ferai.
D'accord ?
Merci,
mais je n'ose pas
vous le demander.
J'ai pris ce poste...
parce que je ne pouvais rien faire
de plus important.
Je savais
qu'il y aurait des sacrifices,
mais je n'avais pas pensé
qu'on me demanderait
de laisser mourir mon père
pour conserver mon travail.
Coucou !
- J'y crois pas !
- Surprise !
Que c'est bon de te voir !
Je suis tellement contente !
Maia dort à côté.
Vous êtes venus comment ?
On a sauté dans un avion.
Maia voulait te dire bonjour,
mais elle s'est endormie
dans le taxi.
J'ignorais que vous veniez.
La location
à San Sebastian est terminée.
Trouver April semble durer
plus longtemps que prévu donc...
Je ne progresse pas beaucoup.
J'ai interrogé des gens,
passé des coups de fil :
aucune trace d'elle.
Je ne veux pas t'imposer
de contraintes supplémentaires...
mais, tu nous manquais énormément,
alors on s'est dit...
Surprise !
Eh bien...
- C'est réussi. Je suis surprise.
- Diana...
Tu partages la vie
d'un homme très impulsif.
Qui sème le vent...
Je suis vraiment contente de te voir.
Mais, je...
Je n'avais pas prévu
de rester longtemps,
et vous savoir là-bas
me donnait une raison de repartir.
C'est toujours le cas.
Pour chacun de nous.
Dès que tu auras retrouvé ta soeur.
En attendant,
on essaie d'être une famille.
Les familles ne vivent pas
sur des continents différents.
D'accord ?
<i>La solitude peut être tout aussi
enivrante que la compagnie.</i>
<i>Bien entendu,
il m'a fallu trouver de la compagnie</i>
<i>avant de m'en rendre compte.</i>
Écoute ça.
C'est un extrait du blog.
"L'humanité se divise
en trois catégories :
"ceux qui ne peuvent bouger,
ceux qui peuvent bouger...
"Et ceux qui bougent."
Très poétique. On sait déjà
que l'auteure sait bien écrire.
C'est une citation.
Tu sais de qui ?
Benjamin Franklin.
La femme, à la bibliothèque.
La bénévole.
C'est elle, l'auteure du blog.
Beau boulot.
Une overdose, on dirait.
Aucune lividité apparente.
À mon avis, la mort remonte
environ à une heure.
On vient de vérifier son ordinateur.
Les techniciens ont trouvé
le journal sur son disque dur.
Audrey Parker était bien
l'auteure du blog.
Aucun signe d'effraction,
juste une fenêtre ouverte.
Pour l'instant,
rien ne semble manquer.
Elle avait une ordonnance
pour de la morphine,
son arthrite devrait vraiment
la faire souffrir.
Son infirmière
lui faisait les injections,
mais parfois, elle lui laissait
des doses supplémentaires.
Ce serait une overdose accidentelle,
fréquente chez les personnes âgées.
Elles se trompent de dosage,
ou oublient qu'elles l'ont déjà pris.
Et selon toi ?
C'était peut-être un accident,
mais elle avait pris de la promicine,
elle savait que
le NTAC la surveillait de près.
L'idée d'aller en prison
à son âge et dans son état ?
Elle a sans doute préféré
se laisser mourir dans son sommeil.
Tu penses à un suicide ?
Si c'était le cas,
ce serait de la faute du NTAC.
De <i>notre</i> faute.
Ce n'était pas un suicide.
Ce n'était pas un suicide,
je vous dis.
C'était un meurtre.
Hanna...
Hanna, aide-moi,
je t'en supplie.
C'était un meurtre !
C'était un meurtre !
Vous voulez en savoir plus ?
Je fais une thèse sur les sectes
du début du 20e siècle.
Je la rends bientôt, donc...
Prévenez-moi
quand vous aurez fini.
Et n'oubliez pas...
Oui, bien sûr. Merci.
Comment ça,
tu dois quitter la ville ?
Philip, on a rendez-vous
dans une heure avec un acheteur.
Tu peux te débrouiller,
mais je dois partir tout de suite.
Et j'ai besoin de liquide.
Je te rembourserai à mon retour.
Tu me fais peur.
Chéri, du calme.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, dis-moi.
Vanessa, il s'est passé
quelque chose hier soir.
Je peux pas t'en parler,
mais je t'assure,
je l'ai fait pour nous deux.
De quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Je peux pas t'en parler.
Je t'appellerai
pour tout t'expliquer,
mais il me faut cet argent.
On va à la banque, viens.
C'était toi.
C'est toi, le responsable.
Je t'ai menacé
et tu m'as tuée.
Tu m'as tuée !
C'est le rapport du légiste
concernant la mort d'Audrey Parker.
Aucun message.
Rien dans son journal
ne laisse présager un suicide.
Il va conclure
à une mort accidentelle.
Tu savais qu'elle a vécu 3 ans
en France dans les années 50 ?
Elle a tout quitté
pour aller vivre là-bas.
Elle a connu Samuel Beckett
à une soirée.
- Il a chanté les louanges de sa robe.
- Tu l'admires, non ?
Oui, un peu, parce qu'elle...
a vécu sa vie sans compromis.
Et c'était pas facile
pour une femme de sa génération,
et pour tout te dire,
ça ne l'est toujours pas.
J'ai renoncé à mon boulot pour
aller vivre en Espagne pour ma fille.
J'ai renoncé à l'Espagne
pour retrouver ma soeur,
et en ce moment,
ma vie ressemble
à une suite de compromis
qui s'enchevêtrent.
Enfin bref, non, je...
Je ne vais pas
diaboliser Audrey Parker
juste parce qu'elle a pris
de la promicine.
Diana, je ne dis pas le contraire.
Mais ce qui lui est arrivé,
la cause de sa mort,
c'est à la police de Seattle
de trouver.
On a trouvé l'auteure du blog,
notre travail s'arrête là.
Non...
l'affaire n'est pas classée.
Je ne me suis pas suicidée !
On m'a assassinée !
C'était quoi, ça ?
- Une surtension ?
- Je sais pas,
c'est la 2e fois, aujourd'hui.
Rappelle-toi, toutes les radios
ont disjoncté chez Audrey.
Bonjour.
Merci à tous d'être venus.
Il y a 4 mois, le gouvernement américain
a fermé ce centre,
ainsi que d'autres centres
comme celui-ci dans tout le pays.
Dans deux jours,
il rouvrira ses portes.
Je recommencerai à guérir,
et ce bâtiment me servira
de centre opérationnel.
Je veux rappeler
à tout le monde,
que tous les 4400 ne sont pas
des révolutionnaires.
Nous ne sommes pas en guerre
contre la société.
Nous voulons lui venir en aide.
Nous en avons les moyens,
et nous ne serons pas réduits au silence
par cette guerre contre la promicine,
lancée par le gouvernement.
En signe de bonne intention
au monde entier,
je guérirai quiconque sera présent
le jour de la réouverture.
Les 4400 ne font plus parler d'eux
depuis un certain temps.
Depuis trop longtemps.
Nous sommes impatients d'y remédier.
Il est actuellement illégal
de faire usage de vos capacités
sans une dérogation spéciale
du gouvernement.
Vous avez un accord ?
Un accord n'est pas envisageable.
Les personnes à la tête de ce pays
ne sont pas vraiment...
arrangeants pour le moment.
Vous ne leur avez pas fait part
de vos plans ?
Pas vraiment,
mais je suis certain
qu'ils se manifesteront.
<i>Pourquoi aller
à l'enterrement d'une femme</i>
<i>que tu n'as vue qu'une fois ?</i>
Je pense que quelqu'un doit
honorer sa mémoire.
D'accord, mais...
Je sais pas, j'essaie de comprendre
ce que tout ça a à voir
avec la recherche d'April.
Quoi ?
Quoi ?
C'est pour ça que tu es revenue,
qu'on a dû quitter l'Espagne.
Oui, et pendant mes recherches,
j'ai des affaires à traiter.
C'est le marché.
Je suis triste pour elle,
tu comprends ?
Elle est morte toute seule.
Elle s'est peut-être suicidée.
C'est une blague ou quoi ?
Ces parasites m'ont suivie
toute la journée.
Au bureau,
dans la voiture en rentrant.
C'est un peu bizarre.
Tu m'as laissé un message
sur mon portable aujourd'hui, non ?
- Oui.
- J'ai rien entendu.
C'était complètement brouillé.
Ce message que je t'ai laissé...
tu l'as conservé ?
J'ai qu'une chose à dire,
c'est vraiment étrange.
J'ai traité ton message
avec au moins
6 filtres audio différents.
Il n'y avait rien,
que des parasites.
Tu t'attendais à quoi ?
Enfin, qu'est-ce qu'on fait ici ?
Je trouvais ça dingue aussi.
Mais ensuite, j'ai tout laissé tomber.
J'ai essayé d'écouter le message...
en situation de silence absolu.
Voilà ce que j'ai trouvé.
<i>Assassinée !</i>
<i>Assassinée !</i>
<i>Assassinée !</i>
On pense qu'Audrey Parker
est douée de...
je pense qu'on peut appeler ça
"projection astrale".
Elle peut projeter sa conscience
hors de son corps.
Une sorte de transmission,
vous comprenez ?
Elle envoie un signal.
C'est un phénomène physique, qui peut
perturber des champs électriques.
Donc, si elle meurt,
en utilisant sa capacité,
alors...
... Alors, son corps disparaît,
mais le signal
est toujours présent.
Donc l'esprit, ou l'âme d'Audrey,
peu importe comment vous l'appelez,
m'a suivi partout,
et cet enregistrement
a capté un fragment
de ce qu'elle essaie de dire ?
Tout à fait.
Ce truc pense qu'il a été tué.
- Elle, Brady, elle...
- Attendez un instant, OK ?
Cette bande
me donne des frissons aussi,
mais ça ne prouve pas forcément
quoi que ce soit.
Audrey a tout consigné.
Relisons son journal
une dernière fois.
Si quoi que ce soit,
ou qui que ce soit paraît suspect,
nous partirons à sa recherche.
Vanessa Martin ?
Excusez-moi.
Bonjour, Tom Baldwin,
et ma partenaire,
Diana Skouris.
- Nous sommes du NTAC.
- Nous recherchons Philip Delacroix.
Pourquoi le NTAC recherche Philip ?
Nous lisons le journal d'une probable
victime de meurtre, Audrey Parker.
Vos noms sont mentionnés
plusieurs fois.
Je suis désolée,
mais je ne connais pas d'Audrey Parker.
Philip Delacroix
n'est pas qui vous croyez.
Son vrai nom est Philip Wilson,
et il est activement recherché
dans plusieurs États.
- Philip ?
- Savez-vous où il est allé ?
Nous sommes allés à son appartement,
mais tout a disparu.
Il est venu me voir hier,
il disait qu'il allait quitter la ville.
Il avait besoin d'argent.
Vous êtes sûrs qu'il est mêlé
à la mort de cette femme ?
On vous tiendra au courant.
Merci.
On dirait qu'Audrey s'en est prise
au mauvais gars.
Lançons une recherche
sur Philip Wilson,
et tous ses pseudonymes connus.
D'accord, retourne au bureau,
occupe-toi de ça,
appelle-moi si besoin, OK ?
Je dois aller quelque part.
Je dois dire que
je m'attendais à votre visite,
mais pas à recevoir
la directrice du NTAC.
Je voulais venir en personne.
Je me devais de soutenir avec fermeté
la position du gouvernement.
Écoutez, vous êtes bien contents
de faire appel à moi
pour vous tirer d'un mauvais pas,
mais dès que j'apparais au grand jour,
vous criez au feu ?
Je ne fais que guérir des gens.
Il n'y a pas de quoi s'alarmer.
Ce n'est pas politique,
encore moins extrémiste.
Je pense que vous oubliez
le contexte.
Pour Washington,
toute utilisation d'une capacité
d'un 4400 est prohibée.
Je n'oublie pas le contexte.
J'essaie de le modifier.
Trop de gens vivent dans la peur.
Je pense pouvoir aider.
Dites-moi,
vous parlez sans cesse
au nom du gouvernement,
mais que pensez-vous
de ce que je fais ?
Personne ne met en doute vos intentions,
M. Farrell.
Pour ma part, vous avez accompli
des choses incroyables.
Mais peu importe
ce que nous pensons.
Si tu continues,
ce n'est pas nous qu'ils enverront.
Ils envisagent d'envoyer les CRS.
Je ne pourrai rien faire, Shawn.
Ils t'arrêteront.
Demain, on sera fixés, alors.
Ça promet d'être intéressant.
On y va.
Je vous l'ai dit,
j'essayais de profiter de Vanessa.
Tous ces mandats d'arrêt,
ils sont bien contre moi,
je l'avoue,
mais j'ai jamais tué personne.
Alors, pourquoi vous enfuir
et essayer de passer au Canada ?
Cette femme savait qui j'étais.
Et si elle comptait me livrer
à la police, quoi que je fasse ?
Je connaissais même pas son nom
avant que vous me le disiez.
Je vous le jure...
je n'ai pas tué Audrey Parker.
- C'était quoi, ça ?
- Il est peut-être en panne...
ou alors qu'il ne croit pas
à votre histoire.
Il dit la vérité,
c'est pas lui.
D'après le légiste, Audrey est morte
entre 7 h et 8 h du matin.
J'ai vérifié l'alibi de Philip.
Il tient.
Il était dans un café
à ce moment-là.
Il était avec une femme,
un nouveau pigeon.
Il l'avait contactée pour
une vente immobilière bidon.
Il est resté 2 h avec elle,
à essayer de lui soutirer de l'argent.
Peut-être qu'elle ment.
Elle le connaît,
elle pourrait le couvrir.
Le serveur du café a confirmé,
le gérant aussi.
Diana, on va...
on va l'emmener
au commissariat,
pour qu'il soit arrêté
en vertu des mandats en cours.
Mais...
si Audrey Parker
a bien été assassinée,
Philip Wilson
n'est pas le coupable.
Viens.
Non... il ment !
C'est certain !
Qu'est-ce qui m'arrive ?
Je suis en train de disparaître.
Il n'y a rien là-dessus.
Je l'ai écouté 100 fois.
Seulement des parasites.
Je sais qu'Audrey m'a tourné autour
toute la nuit.
Mon portable, mon répondeur,
la télévision,
ça n'a pas arrêté de disjoncter.
Elle essaie
de me dire quelque chose.
Sûrement, mais...
comme je te l'ai dit,
tout ce qu'il reste d'Audrey,
c'est de l'énergie.
Une sorte de signal
et les signaux s'estompent.
Elle s'affaiblit ?
Quand elle vous parle,
ça réduit d'autant l'énergie
qui lui reste.
Si elle garde le silence,
elle sera là plus longtemps.
Peut-être qu'elle arrivera
à se faire entendre une nouvelle fois,
mais,
ça pourrait être la dernière.
Elle pourrait disparaître.
Très bien,
on reprend son journal.
On interroge tous ceux qui...
Diana, arrête.
Je sais que tu estimes
Audrey Parker,
et autant te dire
qu'après ce que j'ai lu, moi aussi.
Elle a pris une dose,
mais ce qu'elle a fait pour Vanessa,
c'était pour l'aider.
Mais...
on a fait ce qu'on devait faire.
On a lu son journal et
on sait toujours pas si elle a été tuée,
et même si c'était le cas,
ce serait pas à nous
de nous en occuper.
Alors maintenant,
il est temps de laisser tomber.
Je suis désolée, Audrey.
Alors,
tu commences à y voir clair ?
Non, pas vraiment.
Enfin, ce type dont ils parlent,
ça pourrait être Jordan Collier.
Il y a des détails qui collent.
Ou ça pourrait être
une coïncidence.
C'est assez vague pour qu'on puisse
l'interpréter comme on veut.
Tu peux pas l'ignorer.
Ce livre nous apprend
comment Collier va triompher.
Vraiment ?
Jordan Collier a besoin
de la bible d'une secte
qui n'a plus aucun membre
depuis 80 ans ?
Oui.
- Et il a besoin de toi.
- Pourquoi ?
Pour lui dire
qu'un illuminé a prédit
qu'il allait être
le messager de Dieu ?
Pour le guider,
être son sorcier.
T'arrêtes pas de dire ça.
Comment le guider ?
Je ne sais rien.
C'est pour ça que je suis là.
Tout ce qui figure dans ce livre
va se réaliser.
Collier conduira le genre humain
vers le salut.
Tu l'y aideras.
Tu me crois pas encore.
C'est pas grave.
Je vais te le prouver.
Je serai au croisement
de Forbes et Shady cette nuit,
vers 2 h du matin.
J'espère que tu viendras.
C'est là que tout commence.
Si tu ne viens pas,
tu ne me reverras plus.
Mais si tu viens,
tu assisteras au commencement,
et je te le promets,
tu auras la foi.
T'es sûre de vouloir faire ça ?
Je vais sûrement avoir des ennuis.
Mais t'es pas obligée
de me suivre.
Les choses ne changent pas
toutes seules ?
Et puis t'as dit que
tu voulais pas être seul.
Je vous ai laissé de l'argent.
Ma maison aussi.
Presque tout ce que j'ai.
Vous le découvrirez bientôt.
Vous avez toujours été si gentille
avec moi.
Lucas, le déjeuner est prêt !
Il faut que tu manges
avant d'aller au travail.
J'arrive, deux secondes.
Tu dois être gentil
avec ta mère, Lucas.
Elle t'aime,
et elle essaie
de t'élever toute seule.
Non, je t'ai déjà dit
que je sais pas
combien ça fait de carats.
Ça vaut au moins 2000 billets.
Mon collier...
C'est mon collier.
Sérieusement,
on se voit quand ?
J'ai vraiment merdé.
C'est mon collier.
C'était toi.
Il faut que je me débarrasse
de ce truc.
Tu m'as tuée.
Ce bâtiment reste fermé.
Ce sont les ordres.
Très bien, pas de problème.
Je peux travailler ici.
Excusez-moi.
Salut.
Comment tu t'appelles ?
Kathy.
J'ai une paralysie cérébrale.
Reculez, M. Farrell.
Je crois qu'on peut arranger ça.
Vous êtes sous notre garde,
maintenant.
Rentrez chez vous !
C'est terminé !
Vous pouvez rentrer chez vous !
S'il vous plaît !
Vous devez le laisser partir.
Il ne fait rien de mal.
Écartez-vous.
On ne veut faire de mal
à personne,
mais ce rassemblement est illégal !
Écartez-vous.
Je suis du NTAC.
Vous voyez bien que ces personnes
ne vous laisseront pas l'emmener.
Regardez,
il y a des gens souffrants ici.
Ces gens sont ceux
que nous essayons de protéger.
Écoutez-moi !
Dites à vos hommes
de baisser leurs armes.
Monsieur,
nous avons perdu le contrôle.
Et le NTAC me dit de reculer.
Oui, Monsieur.
Je comprends.
Lâchez-le.
Si je pouvais avoir un peu d'espace.
Alors...
reprenons.
Je n'ai jamais réellement
cherché à comprendre
pourquoi j'étais si proche d'Audrey.
- Je...
- Approche.
Je crois que je me suis identifiée
à elle, tu vois ?
Si j'avais fait...
d'autres choix, ou...
ou choisi une autre voie,
j'aurais pu être celle
qui meurt toute seule.
Peut-être,
mais c'est pas le cas,
et ça n'arrivera pas.
Non, allez.
Laisse sonner.
<i>Laissez un message,
nous vous rappellerons dès que possible.</i>
C'est elle.
C'est Audrey.
Je voulais pas la tuer.
Je le jure.
Je voulais juste ses affaires.
Je lui ai injecté la morphine
pour qu'elle dorme
pendant que je fouillais sa maison.
J'ai vu ma mère le faire
des centaines de fois,
je pensais que ça irait.
C'était un accident.
Vous prendrez ça en compte, hein ?
Je le jure devant Dieu,
c'était un accident.
Pas vraiment un expert en crime.
Non, mais si Audrey
n'avait pas laissé son nom
sur mon répondeur,
qui sait si on l'aurait trouvé ?
Elle était courageuse.
Elle devait savoir que nous recontacter
lui coûterait le temps qui lui restait.
Pas de parasites depuis hier soir.
Je suppose qu'elle est partie
comme elle a vécu sa vie,
avec classe.
Tu crois que c'est ce qu'on ressent
après avoir couru un marathon ?
Je peux pas savoir.
Mais tu ferais mieux de dormir,
on a même pas soigné
la moitié des gens qui étaient là.
Salut, Shawn.
Salut, oncle Tommy.
Je sais que tu es fatigué,
ça m'ennuie de demander, mais...
tu serais partant
pour un de plus ?
Ouais, bien sûr.
Il s'appelle Donald.
C'est mon père.
Je vous serais reconnaissante
si vous pouviez l'aider.
Bonjour, Donald.
Allons dans mon bureau, OK ?
La directrice du NTAC
bénéficiant des capacités d'un 4400 ?
Vous êtes sûre d'être prête
pour les retombées ?
Ils ont laissé cet endroit ouvert.
Premier faux pas.
Qu'ils me virent.
C'est la chanson préférée d'Audrey.
Elle en a parlé souvent
dans son journal.
Logique.
Je crois que cette chanson
a été écrite dans les années 30.
Oh, mon Dieu.
C'est elle.
Elle est encore là.
Où est le magnétophone ?
Il faut enregistrer.
Non, pas besoin d'enregistrer.
Je sais déjà
ce qu'elle nous dit.
Elle nous dit au revoir.
C'est tellement beau.
Je suis prête.
Tu peux t'arrêter.
C'est ici.
Contente que tu sois venu.
Ouais, moi aussi.
Une super vue
sur rien du tout.
Ça ne va pas tarder.
Comment ça ?
Qu'est-ce qui va arriver ?
Faut que tu tournes là !
<i>On se tire, on se tire, roule !</i>

<i>SeriesSub</i> presents...
The world will have to
deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...
Say hello to
the new head of NTAC.
- Meghan Doyle.
- Hi.
The news isn't good...
your father's had a relapse,
and I think it's time we start
preparing ourselves for the inevitable.
- <i>Who's Cassie?
- <i>I'm not what you'd call real.
I'm Kyle's ability.
A Messiah who rises from the dead,
who passes on a sacred elixir?
The healer who lays his hands
upon the sick?
And don't forget about the Shaman.
The Shaman is you, Kyle.
Of course, Heather Tobey...
I teach at the school here now.
<i>I finally found a place where
they won't run me out on the rails
<i>for being a 4400.
Whatever you were given
to take away your abilities,
it induced a permanent allergy
to promicin.
You will never get
your abilities back, Miss Tyler.
Does that mean
I'm getting out of here?
- One of the names was April Skouris.
- My sister took the shot?
You're going back
to Seattle.
I was... thinking about asking
for temporary reinstatement.
She's never coming back here.
This is my sister.
I'll do whatever it takes.
<i>At first, my story may sound familiar.
<i>It's all about a life
lived on the surface,
<i>careless youth that believes
it will last forever...
I'll get that.
You must have broken
a lot of hearts back then, Miss Parker.
St. Tropez.
August, 1955.
The owner of that yacht
proposed to me, you know.
I turned him down.
You turned them all down.
Are you ready
for your morphine shot?
Your dinner's in the fridge,
and I prepared
another dose of morphine
if the pain in your hands
gets bad again.
Mom?
You said we'd be here for 15 minutes.
I'm late for my shift.
I'll be done in a minute, Lucas.
You wanted me to take this job,
so if they fire me, it's on you.
Can I get you anything else?
- Would you mind?
- Of course not.
<i>In the end, all I was left with
were frivolous memories
<i>and no one to share them with.
There you go.
So beautiful.
<i>Life had become nothing
but a tedious string of pointless days.
<i>Until I decided
to do something about it.
<i>I took that shot...
<i>Promicin.
<i>And it changed everything.
<i>My soul, my consciousness,
<i>whatever you'd like to call it,
<i>can leave my body.
<i>I can leave my body,
<i>and I can be young again.
<i>You can't see me, or hear me,
<i>but I'm there.
<i>In the blink of an eye,
I can go wherever I want,
<i>see anything, or anybody,
<i>like a young woman about to realize
how gifted she really is.
There you are.
Vanessa, you've got to get out there.
Everyone wants to
meet the artist.
What if they hate it?
What if they hate me?
You're kidding, right?
You've already sold
five paintings.
You're a hit.
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Vanessa Martin!
<i>This ability of mine
<i>has truly changed my life
for the better.
<i>I feel more free, and...
<i>more connected
to the world around me,
<i>to other people.
<i>I get to be
a fly on the wall,
<i>and I get to see the side of people
that they try to hide from the world.
Yes, I am Vanessa's agent.
I don't mean to take credit.
I mean, she's the artist, but...
I really helped her
get out there.
Maybe I could help you.
Would love to see your work,
especially the nudes.
<i>I thought my story
was going to end
<i>with me withering
into bitter regret
<i>and desperation.
<i>Instead, life has handed me
another chance,
<i>and I intend
to make the most of it.
<i>Taking the shot has given me
a new will to live,
<i>a gift that allows me
to do and feel things
<i>that no one else on earth
has experienced before.
<i>Yet all you hear is the government
saying how bad promicin is...
"How no one should take
the shot.
"If you're reading this,
you should know,
"it hasn't been bad for me.
"For me,
it changed everything.
Maybe it could for you, too."
That's the last entry.
Whoever's writing this
posts the blog anonymously.
We take it down,
it goes up someplace else.
I have to admit,
it's well written.
If I were on the fence,
and I read this,
I might take the shot.
That's exactly why this journal
is making people in DC nervous.
The author doesn't sound
like a radical.
She sounds like...
- somebody's aunt.
- And if your aunt's
willing to take a chance on
getting an ability, why shouldn't you?
Assuming the woman is telling
the truth about what she can do,
I mean, okay, it might be irresponsible
that she's writing about it,
but it's not a threat.
Isn't that what we do here?
We track down threats?
We're not the thought police.
Taking promicin
is illegal.
Not to mention
potentially fatal.
If that blog inspires 20 people
to take promicin,
10 of them are going to die.
Don't forget about the ones
who survive.
Do you really think they'll all
be lovely people, too?
Do you think their abilities
will be as benign as hers?
This woman has to be stopped,
and we can find out exactly
what her intentions were,
just as soon as you find her.
- Bring her in.
- I'll go put on the riot gear.
Get the tear gas.

The public library.
A hotbed
for treasonous activity.
Be careful what you say, Tom.
How do we know
they're all not in on it?
Excuse me.
I'm Tom Baldwin.
This is my partner, Diana Skouris.
- We're from NTAC.
- NTAC?
How can I help you?
Someone's been uploading
sensitive material to the internet
from an IP address
inside this library.
The branch manager told us
that you were the volunteer docent
- in charge of the computers here?
- Well, that's right.
The post we're interested in
went up around 11:15 yesterday.
Is there some way
we could...
track down who was using
the computers at that time?
Do you have a warrant of some kind,
or did you just bring your badge?
No warrant...
yet.
We were hoping you'd want to cooperate.
This is part of
- an important investigation, Miss...
- Parker.
And if I didn't think
it would make trouble for this library,
I wouldn't give you
anything at all.
Whatever happened to
people's right to privacy?
Well, I appreciate
how you feel, Miss Parker,
but we're just trying
to keep people safe.
- That's all.
- There...
Names, log-in times,
member ID numbers.
- Happy hunting.
- Thank you.
"The man who trades freedom
for security,
"does not deserve
nor will he receive either."
Benjamin Franklin.
At least, you're an educated tyrant.
Thanks again.
James is doing very well
so far.
If he sticks with the program
for the whole 10 weeks,
I'm sure his concentration
will improve.
Thank you.
Shawn Farrell...
There's not much to tell.
After the 4400 center
shut down,
the only work I could get
was volunteering
at the child development
clinic here.
It's okay.
Fills the days.
But if I use my ability, if I draw out
whatever talent these kids have,
I go to jail.
It's crazy.
I know.
Jordan put the shot out there,
and now we're all a threat.
Ever since I woke up in the hospital,
I've been thinking,
"what are the 4400s
supposed to do now,
join the revolution?"
It's that, or we just pretend we're
no different than the rest of the world.
That's just the times we live in,
I guess.
No, see, I can't accept that.
I've been thinking of starting
my healing foundation again.
Maybe even reopening the center.
I'd be putting my own money up,
to get things started.
Someone has to show people
that we can...
we can do good.
That we are good.
I can heal people,
and you make kids better.
You give them a talent.
You change their lives.
There's nothing wrong
with any of it.
If you try to become
a public figure again,
the government is going to
come down on you.
- Maybe...
- They'll have to.
Maybe.
I was just...
I was hoping
I wouldn't be doing it alone.
Hi, Kyle.
Sorry,
didn't mean to startle you.
What are you doing here?
What are you?
Look, I know you're not real,
but are you part of my thoughts?
Just think of me as your guide,
Right now, I need you to go back
to that house on Barclay Court,
- to the book.
- Why?
I've already read it.
It said collier's supposed to be...
God's messenger.
I'm some kind of Shaman.
- It's nuts.
- You've read the book,
but you don't believe it yet.
To do that,
you have to study it.
Own it.
Let me ask...
What if I don't listen to you?
Do you just keep showing up?
Kyle, you took that shot
for a reason.
You wanted something to happen.
Well, I'm what happened.
I'm your ability, and I'm telling you,
get that book.
It's going to change
everything.
Philip Delacroix?
I've been hoping
to speak to you.
Do I know you?
No, but we've both taken
an interest in the same person.
Vanessa Martin?
She's a very talented artist,
don't you think?
Of course.
"Delacroix"...
"Delacroix"...
That's a good choice
for an agent's name.
It has a nice exotic ring to it.
Do you think
that Vanessa might
find it interesting
if I tell her that
your real name is Philip Wilson?
That you pretended to be
a real estate agent in Arlington, Texas,
and talked old couples
out of their retirement savings?
That you have an outstanding warrant
for your arrest there,
and in Florida as well?
I think she'd say you're crazy.
Vanessa trusts me.
Of course, she does,
but that's your game, isn't it?
Now, what were you going to do,
convince her to let you
handle her money,
and then pull up stakes...
when you felt
you'd bled her dry?
Who are you?
I'm someone who wants to protect
Vanessa's future.
When I was her age,
I was interested in art, too,
but I didn't have
Vanessa's gifts,
so I intend...
to make sure that she has a chance
to make the most of them.
To do that,
she has to be
free of you.
So you have a choice,
Mr. Wilson.
Leave Vanessa alone
and drive away from Seattle...
forever,
or stay...
and I'll report you
to the police.
We interviewed everyone
from that computer log today.
We're waiting for the results
of their promicin tests,
but I don't think any of them...
are the blogger.
We'll review the journals
in the morning, see what shakes loose.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, fine.
Thanks for the update.
Actually...
Everything's not okay.
I came home from graduate school
for christmas one year.
I knew right away there was
something wrong with my dad.
He had these...
tremors.
Weird tics.
He was diagnosed
with Huntington's disease
about a month later.
- I'm sorry. that's awful.
- It was...
more than a decade ago.
His doctor just told me
he has pneumonia... again.
Who knows if he'll be able
to fight it off?
I called DC this morning.
I asked them if...
maybe...
if I could convince
your nephew, Shawn, to see him,
maybe, he could heal my father.
Shawn's a generous guy.
I'm sure he'll do it.
They said "No".
As the head of NTAC,
I have to set an example.
I can't...
benefit personally
from the application
of a 4400 ability.
My dad's been dying
for 10 years.
There's no cure
for Huntington's.
And then I met your nephew.
If you want me to talk to shawn,
I will.
Okay?
Thank you,
but I don't know
if I can ask you to do that.
I took this post...
because it seemed like
the most important thing I could do.
I knew
there would be sacrifices,
but I never thought
my bosses would tell me
that if I want to keep my job,
I have to let my father die.
Hi there.
- Ben! Oh my God!
- Surprise!
It's great to see you.
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Shh...
Maia's asleep in her room.
How did you get here?
Well, we hopped a flight.
Maia wanted to stay up
and say hi,
but she was out cold
by the time the cab dropped us off.
I had no idea you were coming.
The lease in San Sebastien
was up.
It's going to take you a lot longer
to find April than you thought, so...
It's been slow going.
I've been interviewing people,
making phone calls, no one has seen her.
I am not going to add
any more pressure to you,
but, me and Maia missed you very much,
so we figured...
Surprise !
Oh, well...
- It worked. I'm surprised.
- Diana...
You have gotten involved
with a very spontaneous guy.
Reap the whirlwind.
It's great to see you.
Don't get me wrong, I just...
I was kinda hoping that
this was only going to be a short trip,
and having you over there meant
I had something to go back to.
Well, you still do...
We all do...
As soon as you find your sister.
Okay?
In the meantime,
we're trying to be a family.
And families are not supposed
to live on separate continents.
Right?
<i>Solitude can be every bit
as exhilarating as companionship.
<i>Of course, I had to find companionship
before I figured that out.
Listen to this.
It's from the blog.
"All mankind is divided
into three classes,
"those who are immovable,
those who are movable,
and those who move."
That's very poetic. The blogger's
a good writer. We already know that.
But that's a quote.
You know who wrote it?
Benjamin Franklin.
The woman from the library.
The volunteer.
She's the one writing this.
Good work.
Looks like an overdose.
Lividity hasn't set in yet.
I'd say she died
about an hour ago.
We just got done
looking at her computer.
The techs found the entire journal
saved in a file on her hard drive.
Audrey Parker was our blogger.
One of the back windows was open,
but there's no sign of forced entry.
Nothing missing
as far as we can tell.
She had a prescription
for morphine,
so her arthritis
must have gotten pretty bad.
Her nurse usually injected her,
but occasionally would leave behind
extra shots for Audrey.
The ME thinks it was
an accidental overdose,
that it happens with older people.
They get confused,
take the wrong dosage,
forget that they've injected themselves.
What do you think?
It might have been an accident,
but, you know, she had taken promicin,
she knew NTAC
was breathing down her neck.
The thought of a prison sentence
at her age and in her condition?
Maybe she figured she'd rather
just drift off to sleep.
You think she committed suicide?
If she did,
she did it because of NTAC.
Because of us.
I didn't kill myself.
I... didn't kill myself.
Somebody did this to me.
Hanna...
Hanna, you have to help me, please.
Somebody did this to me!
Somebody did this to me!
You're back for more?
I'm doing my thesis on cults
from the early 20th century.
It's due soon, so...
Just let me know
when you're done.
And don't forget
to feed the kitty?
What do you mean,
you need to leave town?
Philip, we have an appointment
with a buyer in an hour.
You can handle it yourself,
but I need to leave, now,
and, I need to borrow some cash.
I'll pay you back
when I see you again.
You're scaring me.
Sweetie, calm down.
Tell me what's going on.
Vanessa,
something happened last night.
I can't tell you about it,
but I promise you,
I did it to protect us.
Protect us from what?
What are you talking about?
I can't tell you right now.
I'll call you in a couple days
and I'll explain everything
but right now
I need that money.
Can we please
just go to the bank?
It was you.
You did it.
I threatened you
and you killed me.
You killed me!
That's the ME's
preliminary report
on the death of Audrey Parker.
There's no note.
Nothing in her journals that indicates
she was considering suicide.
He's going to rule it
an accidental death.
Do you know
she lived in France
for three years in the 1950's?
Like, just pulled up
all the stakes and moved there?
She met Samuel Beckett at a party.
He complimented her
on her dress.
You admire her, don't you?
Yeah, in a way,
because she just...
lived her life
without compromise,
and that was no easy thing
for a woman of her generation,
and to be honest,
it's really no easy thing now.
I gave up my career to move
to Spain for my daughter.
I gave up Spain to come back
here to look for my sister,
and right now
my entire life just feels like
a bunch of compromises
all just strung together.
Anyway, no, no, I...
I'm not going to
demonize Audrey Parker
because she took
a promicin shot.
Diana,
I'm not saying you should.
But as far as what happened
to her, why she died,
that's for the Seattle police
to figure out.
Our involvement in this ended
as soon as we learned
she was behind the blog.
No...
you can't just file me away.
I didn't kill myself!
I was murdered!
What the hell was that?
- A power surge?
- I don't know,
but that's the second time today.
Remember all the radios
freaked out at Audrey's house.
Good morning.
Thank you all for coming.
Four months ago,
the US government
shut this building down,
along with
many other buildings like it
across the country.
In two days, I'm going to be
reopening its doors.
I will be starting up
my healing foundation again,
and I plan on using
this building
as its base of operations.
I would like to remind
everyone out there
that the 4400
aren't all revolutionaries.
We are not at war with society.
We want to help it.
We can help, and will not
be forced into silence
by the government's
so-called war on promicin.
As a show of good faith
to the world at large,
I will heal anyone who is
present on our first day open.
The 4400 have been silent
for a long time.
Too long.
We look forward to
meeting the world again.
It's currently illegal
to use a 4400 ability
without special dispensation
from the government.
Have you made
arrangements with them?
There are no arrangements
to be made.
The people who run the country
aren't in a very...
accommodating mood right now.
So you haven't discussed
your plans with them?
Not exactly,
but I'm sure
they will be in touch.
<i>Why are we
going to the funeral of a woman</i>
<i>that you've only met once?</i>
I think someone has to pay her
some respect.
Okay, but...
I don't know, I'm trying
to make sense of this
to see what this has to do
with tracking down April.
What?
What?
Diana, that's why
you came back here, right?
I mean,
that's why we had to leave Spain.
Yes, and while I'm looking for her,
I have to work cases.
That's the deal,
and I just feel badly for her,
you know?
She died alone.
She might have
committed suicide.
What is going on?
Everywhere I go today,
I just keep hearing that static.
At work,
in the car on the way home.
Yeah, that's kind of weird.
You left me a voice message
on my cell phone today, right?
- Oh, yeah.
- I couldn't hear a thing.
It was all staticky and garbled.
That cell phone message
I left you...
Did you save it?
I just want to say,
this is really weird.
I ran that cell phone message
you brought me
through about six different
audio filters.
There was nothing there,
just static.
Well, why would you expect
anything different?
I mean, come on, guys,
what are we even doing here?
Hey, I thought it was
a little crazy, too.
But then I tried
dropping everything out.
I tried listening to the message
in what, theoretically,
should have been
total silence.
This is what I found.
<i>Murdered!</i>
<i>Murdered!</i>
<i>Murdered!</i>
We think Audrey Parker's
ability was...
Well, I guess you'd have to
call it "astral projection."
She could send her consciousness
out of her body.
That's a kind of broadcast, right?
She's sending a signal.
It's a real thing. I mean,
it could disrupt electrical fields.
So if she died
while she was using her ability,
then...
Then her body's gone,
but the signal is
still out there.
So Audrey's mind, or soul,
or whatever you want to call it,
has been following me around,
and that recording
has caught a fragment
of what she's trying to say?
Exactly. It obviously
thinks it was murdered.
- She, Brady, she...
- Just hold up a second, okay?
That tape gave me chills, too,
but it's not necessarily
proof of anything.
Audrey wrote everything down.
Let's just go back
over the journals one last time.
If there's anything in there,
anyone who seems suspicious,
we'll just track it down.
Vanessa Martin?
Excuse me.
Hi. I'm Tom Baldwin.
This is my partner,
Diana Skouris.
- We're from NTAC.
- Hi.
We're looking for
Philip Delacroix.
Why is NTAC looking for Philip?
We've been reviewing the journals
of a possible murder victim
named Audrey Parker.
There were repeated references
to you and your agent.
I'm sorry, I don't know anyone
named Audrey Parker.
Philip Delacroix
is not who he claims to be.
His real name is Philip Wilson,
and there are warrants out
in several states for his arrest.
- Philip?
- Do you know where Philip went?
We've already been by his apartment,
and it's cleared out.
He came to see me yesterday,
said he was leaving town.
He needed money.
You don't think he had anything to do
with that woman's death, do you?
We'll let you know.
Thank you.
Looks like Audrey confronted
the wrong guy.
Let's put out an APB
on Philip Wilson,
and all his known aliases.
Yeah, go back to the office,
put it on the wire,
call me if anything pops, okay?
I've got to be somewhere.
Well, I have to say, I expected
a visit from you guys,
but I didn't think that
they'd send the head of NTAC.
I wanted to do this in person.
I had to emphasize
the seriousness
of the government's position.
You know, you guys are
sure happy to call me
when you need me
to bail you out of a jam,
but the moment I want to go public,
you break out the fire hose?
I'm just healing some people.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's not a political statement.
Not a radical act.
I'm afraid
you're misreading the climate.
As far as DC is concerned,
any unsanctioned use of
a 4400 ability is a radical act.
I'm not misreading the climate.
I'm trying to change it.
There's too much fear
out there right now.
I think I can help.
I have to ask you,
you keep talking about
the government's position,
but how do you feel
about what I'm doing?
No one's questioning
your motives, Mr. Farrell.
Personally, I think you've done
some amazing things...
But it doesn't matter,
really, what we believe.
If you go through with this,
it won't be us stopping you.
They're talking about
sending riot squads down.
There won't be anything
I can do, Shawn.
They will arrest you.
I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
It's going to be interesting.
Come on.
I told you, I was trying
to take advantage of Vanessa.
All those arrest warrants,
that's me. I did those.
I'm admitting that to you,
but I never murdered anyone.
Then why did you run?
Why were you trying
to cross the border into Canada?
That woman knew who I was.
How did I know she wasn't going
to expose me
to the police
no matter what I did?
I didn't even know her name
until you told me.
I swear,
I didn't kill Audrey Parker.
- What was that?
- Maybe it's broken.
Maybe it just doesn't
believe your story.
He's telling the truth.
He didn't do it.
The ME says that Audrey died
between 7:00 and 8:00 in the morning.
I just checked out Philip's alibi.
It holds.
He was at a coffee shop
that whole time.
He met a woman for breakfast.
She was another mark.
He had her on the line
for a phony real estate deal.
He was with her for two hours
trying to get money out of her.
Well, maybe she's lying.
If she knows him,
she might be covering for him.
The sales clerk at the coffee shop
confirms it, too, so does the manager.
Diana, we'll...
We'll hand him over
to Seattle PD,
have him arrested
on the outstanding warrants.
But...
If Audrey Parker was murdered,
Philip Wilson didn't do it.
Come on.
No... no, he's lying.
He has to be.
What's happening to me?
I'm fading away.
There's nothing there.
I've listened again and again.
It's just static.
I know that Audrey was following
me around all last night.
My cell phone,
answering machine,
television,
just breaking up constantly.
I mean, she's trying
to tell me something.
She probably is,
but it's like I told you,
whatever's left
of Audrey is energy,
you know, a kind of signal,
and signals fade.
You think she's getting weaker?
Each time she talks to you,
it costs her a little
of whatever energy she has left.
If she stays silent,
she'll be around longer.
Maybe she could muster enough
to communicate with you
one more time,
but it might be
the last thing she ever does.
She could disappear forever.
All right, we'll just go back
into her journals.
We'll interview everyone in them...
Diana, stop.
I know you respect Audrey Parker,
and to tell you the truth,
after reading about her
yesterday, I do, too.
She took promicin, but look
what she did for Vanessa Martin.
She was trying to help people.
But we've done
what we agreed to do.
We looked through the journals,
we still can't be sure she was murdered,
and even if she was,
it still wouldn't be our case.
Now, I'm sorry.
It's time to let this go.
I'm sorry, Audrey.
So is it starting to
make sense yet?
No, not really.
I mean, yeah,
the guy they talk about
could be Jordan Collier.
Some of the details do match up.
Or it could be a coincidence.
They left it vague enough
that anyone could
read into this
whatever they want to.
Well, you can't just dismiss it.
That book is a blueprint
for how Collier's going to succeed.
Oh, yeah? Jordan Collier
needs the handbook of a cult
that hasn't even had
a living member in 80 years?
He does.
- And he needs you.
- For what?
To tell him some
crazy guy predicted
he was going to be
God's messenger?
To guide him.
to be his Shaman.
You keep saying that.
How can I guide him?
I don't know anything.
Well, that's what
you've got me for, Kyle.
Everything in that book
is going to come true.
Collier will lead the human race
to salvation.
You will help him.
You don't believe me yet.
It's okay.
I'll show you.
I'm going to be at the intersection
of Forbes and Shady tonight
around 2:00 AM.
I hope you'll show.
That's where
it's all beginning.
If you're not there,
you'll never see me again,
but if you come,
you'll see it all begin,
and I promise,
you will believe.
Are you sure
you want to do this?
I'm probably gonna get
into a lot of trouble.
Doesn't mean
you have to join in on the fun.
Nothing changes on its own,
right?
And besides, you said
you didn't want to be alone.
I left you money, Hanna.
My house, too.
Almost everything I have.
You'll find out
in a couple of days.
You were always so kind to me.
Lucas, lunch is ready!
Come on, you've got
to eat before work!
Yeah, I'll be down in a minute.
Hold on!
You need to be kind
to your mother, Lucas.
She loves you,
and she's trying to raise you
all on her own.
No, I already told you,
I don't know
how many carats it is.
Well, I'm sure it's worth
a couple grand at least.
My necklace...
That's my necklace.
Well, seriously,
how soon can you meet me?
I screwed up really bad.
That's my necklace.
It was you.
Well, I need
to get rid of this thing.
You killed me.
This building stays closed.
Those are my orders.
All right, not a problem.
I can do my work right here.
Excuse me.
Hi.
What's your name?
Kathy. I have cerebral palsy.
Step away, Mr. Farrell.
Well, I think that there's
something we can do about that.
You're in our custody now.
Right, go home now!
This is all over!
You can go home!
Please!
You've got to let him go.
He's not doing anything wrong.
Step aside.
Look, we don't want
to hurt anyone,
but this is an illegal assembly!
- Stop! Stop...
- Step aside.
I'm from NTAC.
Can't you see these people aren't going
to let you just walk him out of here?
Now, look around you.
There are sick people here.
They're the mainstream. They're
who we're trying to protect.
Listen to me!
Tell your men to stand down.
Sir, the situation's
out of control.
I've got NTAC
telling me to back off.
Yes, sir.
I understand.
Let him go!
Everyone... If I could
just have a little space?
Now...
Where were we?
I guess I haven't really
thought much
about why I've let Audrey
under my skin.
- I...
- Come here.
I guess I just...
I identify with her, you know?
If I had made different choices,
or chosen a different path,
I could the one
who's dying alone.
Maybe,
but you didn't,
and you won't.
No, no, no, come on.
Let it ring.
<i>Leave a message and we'll get
back to you as soon as we can...</i>
That's her.
That's Audrey.
I didn't mean for her to die.
I swear I didn't.
I just wanted her stuff.
I gave her the morphine shot
so that she would stay asleep
while I looked through her house.
I've seen my mom inject her
so many times,
I figured it would be okay.
It was an accident.
You'll take that into account,
won't you?
I swear to god,
it was an accident!
Not exactly
a master criminal.
No, but if Audrey hadn't
have left his name
on my answering machine,
who knows
if we would've found him?
She was a brave lady.
She must have known
that communicating again
would use up whatever
time she had left.
I haven't heard any static
since last night.
I guess she went out
the way she lived,
with style.
You think
that this is how you feel
after a marathon?
I wouldn't know.
But you'd better get
a good night's sleep.
We're not even halfway through
the list of people who showed up.
Hey, Shawn.
Hey, uncle Tommy...
I'm sure you're tired,
so I hate to even ask, but...
Are you up for one more?
Yeah, sure.
His name's Donald.
He's my father.
I'd be grateful
if you could help him.
Hello, Donald.
Let's go into my office, okay?
The head of NTAC benefiting
personally from a 4400 ability?
You sure you're up
for the fallout?
They let this place stay open.
They blinked.
Let them fire me.
This is Audrey's favorite song.
She mentioned it a couple times
in her journals.
Makes sense.
I think this song was written
back in the '30s.
Oh, my God.
It's her.
She's still here.
Where's that little tape recorder?
We've gotta get this.
No, we don't need
to record this.
I already know
what she's saying.
She's saying goodbye.
It's so beautiful.
I'm ready.
You can stop.
This is the spot.
I'm glad you showed.
Yeah, me too.
A great view of nothing.
It's all about to happen.
What do you mean?
What's going to happen?
Gotta take this turn, baby!
<i>Let's go, let's go, come on!</i>

4400 avaient disparu
4400 sont revenus
Tous possèdent une aptitude unique
L'un d'entre eux porte un message
Quiconque peut devenir exceptionnel
Le risque est immense
À la hauteur des bienfaits
C'est irréversible
Le monde devra nous accepter.
<i>Précédemment dans</i> Les 4400...
- Qui est Cassie ?
- Je suis la capacité de Kyle.
<i>Vous allez voir
votre cousin Shawn ?<i>
<i>Quelqu'un devrait lui injecter
une bonne dose de promicine.<i>
Ça ne va pas tarder.
Qu'est-ce qui va arriver ?
Parcourez le livre,
si vous le souhaitez.
Un chapitre est écrit dans
une sorte de code, ou je ne sais quoi.
- Voici mon petit ami, Ben.
- Elle m'a beaucoup parlé de toi.
Tu m'as vue me marier
avec le petit ami de ma sœur ?
Ces doses sont gratuites.
Distribuez-les à qui veut,
mais expliquez-leur bien
les risques.
On ne vous promet rien.
Comme d'habitude.
Cette place est libre ?
Plus maintenant.
Je m'appelle April.
Peter. Barton.
Qu'est-ce qui vaut le coup, ce soir ?
Je vous conseille le Balalaïka.
Barman,
deux de plus, s'il vous plaît ?
Ça ne vous dérange pas ?
Ne croyez pas que
je cherche à vous draguer.
Alors, qui êtes-vous, Peter ?
Responsable des relations clients
chez ANEXXO.
Classé dans le Fortune 500.
Énergie. Communications.
Contrats pour la défense...
Je vois. Vous êtes de ceux
qui dirigent le monde.
Moi ? Non, mais...
je travaille pour eux.
Et que faites-vous à Seattle ?
Notre société est sur une affaire
très importante, et...
il y a quelques contretemps, alors...
je viens régler tout ça.
Vous allez résoudre le problème ?
Espérons-le.
Et comment vous comptez faire ça ?
Je vais soudoyer quelqu'un
pour qu'il ferme les yeux.
Je n'en reviens pas
de vous avoir dit ça.
Écoutez, faites-moi plaisir...
- oubliez ce que je viens de dire.
- C'est déjà oublié.
De quelle somme s'agit-il ?
300 000 $.
Je les récupère demain après-midi.
Mon Dieu.
Je ne comprends pas
pourquoi je vous raconte tout ça.
Ils ont mis quelque chose
dans mon verre ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Juste une rencontre dans un bar.
Ne me posez plus de questions, OK ?
Dans quelle chambre
êtes-vous, Peter ?
315.
Ce que je viens de dire,
ne le répétez pas.
Ce ne serait bon ni pour vous,
ni pour moi, ni...
pour personne.
Laisse-moi deviner...
- La vérité est dure à entendre.
- Comme souvent.
Alors, qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
Adultère ? Fraude fiscale...
Plutôt une société véreuse,
tentative de corruption.
Et 300 000 $
qui arrivent demain.
- Chambre 315.
- 300 000 ?
Bébé, t'es trop forte.
Bon, on échange notre silence
contre 20 %.
Ça fait...
60 000 $.
Tu m'aimes ?
Oui.
Et je peux difficilement
te mentir.
Tu ne peux pas.
Personne ne le peut.
Heureusement que je me souvenais
de cet endroit.
J'ai passé de super étés ici,
quand j'étais gamin.
C'est plutôt mort dans le coin
jusqu'en juin, ce qui...
n'est pas plus mal, parce que
le monde entier est à ta recherche.
<i>La traque d'Isabelle Tyler s'intensifie</i>
Je devrais peut-être me rendre.
Et passer le reste de ta vie en prison ?
Je crois pas.
C'est pas un hasard si j'étais là
au moment de l'accident.
J'ai été envoyé
pour t'aider à t'échapper.
Tout ceci à un sens.
Quel sens ?
Franchement, j'en sais rien encore.
Les réponses doivent être dans ce livre.
J'espère qu'elles ne se cachent pas
derrière ce code.
Tu crois vraiment que
Jordan Collier est le Messie ?
- Et que la promicine sauvera le monde ?
- Oui, je le crois.
Même si c'est vrai,
quel rapport avec moi ?
Mes capacités ont disparu.
Mon corps rejette la promicine.
C'est moi, l'ennemi.
J'ai blessé Shawn.
J'ai essayé de tuer
Jordan Collier.
Et moi, je l'ai fait.
Crois-moi.
Je sais ce qu'on ressent...
en prison, quand tu abandonnes
tout espoir d'en sortir.
Quand tu as commis des actes
que personne ne te pardonnera jamais.
Tous ces gens, qui sont allés trop loin
pour qu'on les pardonne,
peut-être ont-ils un rôle à jouer
dans le nouveau monde de Jordan Collier.
Mon destin est d'en faire partie,
d'aider à le construire,
tout comme toi.
Colin ?
Difficile de te retrouver, April.
Je t'ai cherchée partout.
Et maintenant
que tu m'as trouvée, Di...
que vas-tu faire de moi ?

C'était pas vraiment malin d'utiliser
le nom de maman pour ta carte de crédit.
Si j'avais su
que tu me chercherais,
je me serais
un peu plus creusé la tête.
J'imagine que tu as dû être furieuse
d'apprendre que j'avais pris une dose.
Je n'étais pas vraiment ravie,
tu as raison.
Mais tu es ma sœur,
et j'étais très inquiète pour toi.
Et surtout,
tu n'aurais jamais pris de dose...
s'il ne s'était rien passé
entre Ben et moi.
On se sent un peu coupable,
c'est ça ?
C'est pas la peine.
Toi et Ben en êtes peut-être
la raison...
mais en prenant cette dose,
j'ai fait le bon choix.
J'ai de l'argent,
plein de fringues,
un mec génial, Colin,
qui m'aime,
et une capacité plutôt sympa.
Combien de fois par semaine
faites-vous l'amour avec Ben ?
Trois.
Mais, ça...
- Ça ne te regarde pas.
- Je sais.
Mais tu as quand même répondu.
Voilà de quoi je suis capable.
Je pose une question,
tu me dis la vérité...
à chaque fois.
Plutôt intéressant.
Mais ça ne marche pas sur toi, hein ?
Pour que moi,
je dise la vérité ?
Heureusement que non.
Que vais-je faire de toi, April ?
Que vais-je faire de toi ?
Retourne en Espagne, Di.
Si tu te sens coupable
pour toi et Ben...
considère que tu es pardonnée.
Profite de ta vie...
et laisse-moi
profiter de la mienne.
C'est merveilleux, papa.
Je suis si contente que tu puisses
remarcher, j'ai hâte de voir ça.
Je dois te laisser.
Moi aussi, je t'aime.
Garrity m'a dit
que vous vouliez me voir.
Vous avez vu le rapport médical final
sur la guérison de votre neveu ?
Oui, bien sûr.
Eh bien, Washington aussi.
Ce niveau élevé de promicine
qui a été détecté dans son système...
Les gens se demandent
d'où cela provient.
D'accord, et après ?
Voyons, Tom...
Quelqu'un est allé à l'hôpital
et a injecté une forte dose de promicine
à votre neveu.
Seuls votre sœur et votre fils
étaient présents à ce moment-là.
Étant donné que je vois mal
Susan être suspecte,
je pense que
vous devriez parler à Kyle.
Excusez-moi, M. Farrell ?
Le Sénateur Lenhoff
désire vous voir.
Le Sénateur Lenhoff ?
Vous êtes sûre ?
Elle en est sûre, moi aussi, et je pense
que vous allez bientôt l'être également.
Roland Lenhoff.
Le Diable lui-même,
en chair et en os.
Il faut qu'on parle...
en privé.
Sénateur, si vous êtes ici
pour m'obliger
- à refermer le centre...
- Détendez-vous, Farrell.
Non, je ne veux pas
fermer cet endroit.
Je veux que vous guérissiez
le plus de gens possible,
ce qui peut surprendre, je sais.
Après tout...
j'ai voté pour la loi
imposant aux 4400
de faire recenser leur capacité.
Et ce n'était qu'un échauffement.
Je crois me rappeler d'un discours
où vous disiez que selon vous,
on devrait tous vivre
derrière des barbelés.
J'étais sûr que vous alliez
évoquer le sujet.
Asseyez-vous.
Allez, asseyez-vous.
Je reconnais...
que j'ai bien engagé
une sorte de guerre contre vous.
Le problème est que
je préside un comité
qui est sur le point de publier
un rapport de 1600 pages
qui conclut,
sans l'ombre d'un doute,
que je perds cette guerre,
et que vous la gagnez.
La promicine ne disparaîtra pas.
Jordan Collier a tout fait pour.
Si vous êtes ici
pour signer une reddition,
- je dois avoir les documents.
- Qui parle de reddition ?
Je me suis battu au Vietnam.
J'ai des médailles qui le prouvent.
Mais l'année dernière,
j'ai emmené ma femme
en vacances à Saigon.
Je suppose que si j'ai pu faire la paix
avec les Viets,
je peux faire la paix avec vous.
Une élection spéciale
est organisée
afin de pourvoir un siège vacant
au conseil municipal de Seattle.
Je veux que vous y postuliez.
Le conseil municipal ?
Sénateur,
je ne suis pas un politicien.
Bien sûr que si, vous l'êtes.
Vous êtes sous les feux de la rampe
depuis que vous avez rouvert ce centre.
Je veux que vous mettiez
votre expérience ici
au service d'une plus grande cause.
Vous êtes l'alternative
indispensable
à Collier et son groupe de radicaux
prônant la promicine.
Vous pouvez emprunter la voie modérée
qui unira les 4400
et les non-4400.
Et cette voie modérée ?
Vous projetez de l'emprunter avec moi ?
Ici même, au centre !
Je perdrai probablement
toute chance d'être réélu,
mes collègues anti-4400
y veilleront.
Mais c'est ce dont
le pays a besoin,
ce dont tout le monde a besoin.
Alors, qu'en dites-vous,
Farrell ?
Êtes-vous prêt
à danser avec le diable ?
Tu aurais dû voir
cette chambre d'hôtel.
Elle doit coûter
entre 600 $ et 700 $ la nuit.
La robe, les chaussures,
se trimbalant de ville en ville.
Avec son aptitude,
peu importe comment elle s'en sert,
elle va se mettre dans le pétrin.
Pourquoi ce sourire ?
Diana, allez,
April est vivante.
La dose ne l'a pas tuée,
elle ne vit pas dans la rue.
Elle s'est même trouvée quelqu'un,
c'est... une victoire.
Ça n'a pas l'aspect
d'une victoire.
Elle va tout foirer,
le NTAC va l'arrêter, et puis quoi ?
Écoute-moi,
viens par ici une seconde.
Tu as parcouru 9 500 km
pour retrouver ta soeur, hein ?
Tu lui as proposé ton aide,
elle l'a refusée.
Ça s'arrête là.
Maintenant, on peut
retourner en Espagne.
Je pense qu'on peut.
- Tu penses ?
- Non, enfin... on va le faire.
Ça va prendre un peu de temps,
à cause du boulot.
Allez, Diana,
ça n'est pas si compliqué.
Tu dois juste y aller,
restituer ton arme et ton badge,
et on est dans un avion
d'ici demain.
Je ne peux pas faire ça,
pas à Tom, ni à Meghan.
Accorde-moi une semaine environ,
et on plie bagage.
- On l'annoncera à Maia ce soir ?
- Ouais, dès qu'on sera rentrés.
Tu ne veux pas que je t'accompagne
pour récupérer l'argent ?
Non, tu le ferais paniquer.
Barton pense que tu lui as jeté
une sorte de malédiction, non ?
- Quel est le problème ?
- Rien.
Tu penses toujours à ta soeur ?
J'ai du mal à croire qu'elle ait fait
tout ce chemin pour me chercher.
Ni qu'elle tenait autant à moi.
Ce n'est qu'une garce,
qui porte des jugements.
Bon débarras.
En outre, tu n'as plus besoin d'elle,
je suis là.
Qu'en dis-tu, on se voit au bar
un peu après 19 h,
- pour un cocktail de célébration ?
- D'accord.
On ira où, après ?
On pourrait crécher
chez mon frère à South Beach.
Il a quitté Phoenix
pour s'installer là-bas.
Jeff dit qu'il y a de quoi
se remplir les poches à Miami.
Les gens de là-bas détiennent
toutes sortes de vilains petits secrets.
Vilains petits secrets.
T'as une minute, mon pote ?
Pas vraiment,
je rejoins quelques amis.
C'est à propos de Shawn.
Quoi donc ?
Le fait qu'il soit sorti du coma
avec toute cette promicine en lui.
Les gens se demandent
si tu as un rapport avec tout ça.
Par "les gens",
tu veux dire le NTAC ?
De quoi tu m'accuses
exactement, papa ?
Je ne t'accuse de rien,
je pose une question.
Ce jour-là à l'hôpital,
as-tu injecté à ton cousin
une dose de promicine ?
Non, pas du tout.
Kyle, écoute-moi.
- Si tu es impliqué là-dedans...
- Dans quoi ?
Je ne sais pas, ces dernières nuits,
tu n'es pas rentré...
- Papa, j'ai 23 ans.
- Je le sais.
Kyle, si tu caches quoi que ce soit,
s'il te plaît...
dis-le-moi maintenant.
Je n'ai rien à dire.
Je suis ravi que
Shawn soit en pleine forme.
Peu importe avec quoi Isabelle
l'a endormi, ça a disparu.
Ou peut-être pas.
Je suppose qu'on ne saura
jamais la vérité, hein ?
On va devoir faire avec.
Je peux partir maintenant ?
<i>C'est Colin.
Laissez un message.</i>
Chéri ?
C'est Colin !
Il a été abattu !
Il y avait tellement de sang.
Maia, va te coucher,
s'il te plaît, ma puce.
Aide-moi, Di.
S'il te plaît, aide-moi.
April, as-tu vraiment pensé
que ce gars, Barton,
allait vous remettre comme ça
plus de 60 000 $ ?
Il avait l'air d'un pigeon facile
et ça a toujours marché avant.
C'est donc comme ça
que tu utilises ta capacité ?
- Pour faire chanter les gens.
- Mon Dieu.
Ne commence pas tes sermons
sur le bien et le mal.
- Non, c'est un peu tard pour ça.
- Ouais, en effet,
- donc, économise ta salive.
- Très bien, calmez-vous.
Du calme, OK ?
Concentrons-nous
sur ce qui est important.
Barton ?
C'est lui, hein ?
Il a tué Colin ?
Eh bien, je dirais
que c'est notre suspect nº 1.
Mais ces 300 000 $
qu'ANEXXO doit débourser
en pot-de-vin,
Barton n'a pas mentionné
par hasard où ils iraient ?
C'est important ?
Colin... le voir là,
étendu sur le sol...
La chambre d'hôtel...
Elle était au nom de Colin,
n'est-ce pas ?
Ou un de ses noms d'emprunt.
Il en avait plusieurs.
Quand ils trouveront le corps,
il n'y a rien là-bas
qui puisse te relier à lui ?
Je pense pas.
Ben, tu peux rester ici ?
Je vais conduire April
à un motel ou...
n'importe où...
loin d'ici et loin de Maia.
Désolée, mais tu devras y rester
tant qu'on n'aura pas éclairci tout ça.
Tu vas me dénoncer ?
On en discutera en chemin.
<i>Je peux compter sur toi,
n'est-ce pas ?<i>
Si mon père te demande,
et il va probablement le faire...
Je ne dirai pas à ton père que
tu m'as donné une dose de promicine.
C'est dur, tu sais ?
Je veux dire, je l'aime tellement,
mais tout ce que je fais...
- Il ne comprendrait pas.
- Je comprends, Kyle.
Vraiment.
C'est juste que j'ai...
d'autres sujets de préoccupation.
Si tu parles d'Isabelle Tyler,
il ne faut pas s'en inquiéter.
- Elle est sûrement loin de Seattle.
- C'est bon à savoir.
Je vais pouvoir alléger la sécurité.
De toute façon,
je ne parlais pas d'elle.
Ça va te sembler bizarre...
Roland Lenhoff...
veut que je me présente
au conseil municipal.
Le gars à l'origine du projet de loi
Dinstman-Lenhoff ?
Pour lui, c'est "si tu ne peux pas
les battre, travaille avec eux".
Et il sait
qu'il ne peut pas nous battre.
C'est super, Shawn.
- Tu as accepté, n'est-ce pas ?
- Je réfléchis.
Tu dois le faire.
Si tu es élu, ça mettra
les 4400 en position de force.
Ils devront nous prendre
au sérieux.
Qui sait ? Tu pourrais devenir Maire,
peut-être même Gouverneur.
Une chose à la fois.
Je ne sais même pas
si je peux être élu.
Tu guéris les gens
avec tes mains,
quel adversaire
peut rivaliser avec ça !
- Tu veux diriger ma campagne ?
- Non.
Mais, tu as ma voix.
Ça en fait déjà une.
C'est pas un problème.
J'aurai les résultats demain.
- Quel nom, sur les échantillons ?
- Pas de nom.
- S'ils sont positifs à la promicine ?
- Pas de nom, Marco.
Je veux que
tout me soit remis en personne.
C'est clair ?
À vrai dire, Tom,
j'ai quelques questions...
Rends-moi service, s'il te plaît.
... Mais je ne les poserai pas.
Merci.
Salut Marco.
Ils m'ont dit que tu étais ici, Tom.
- Tu as une minute ?
- Ouais, bien sûr.
Je sais que ma soeur a fait beaucoup
d'erreurs dans sa vie,
mais je sais aussi qu'April a pris
cette dose à cause de moi.
Je comprends que tu veuilles
protéger ta soeur, Diana,
mais si elle connaît l'identité
du tueur...
Je ne peux pas être responsable
de l'incarcération d'April, Tom.
Elle est positive.
C'est une condamnation à vie,
tu connais les règles.
En plus, il est possible
que la police remonte à Barton
d'elle-même.
Et sinon ?
Que se passera-t-il ?
Alors, je dirai tout que je sais
aux autorités.
Après que j'aie acheté à April
un aller simple pour Marrakech.
April Skouris, n'est-ce pas ?
Je suis un ami
du frère de Colin, Jeff.
- Jeff ?
- Non, moi, c'est Larry, mais...
Jeff a appris ce qui est arrivé
et il...
Il m'envoie pour te faire sortir
de Seattle.
Vraiment ?
Où on va ?
Ma voiture est là-bas.
On va à Phoenix.
- Et mes affaires ?
- Tu en trouveras d'autres, OK ?
Si on fait vite,
on peut avoir le prochain vol.
Attends, Phoenix ?
Jeff est parti pour la Floride.
- Peu importe.
- Oh, mon Dieu, à l'aide !
Il essaie de me tuer !
Au secours !
Di, dis-moi ce qu'il se passe,
car je n'y comprends rien.
Pourquoi s'en prendre
à Colin et à moi ?
On n'a jamais touché à cet argent.
Ce pot-de-vin
qu'ANEXXO va verser,
ils ne veulent clairement pas
que ça se sache.
Je crois qu'il est temps de parler
à ce Peter Barton.
Je viens avec vous.
Vous voulez la vérité ?
Je peux vous l'obtenir.
Tu en es sûre ?
Parce que...
Tout le monde peut tromper
les détecteurs de mensonges.
Tu aimes bien ma soeur ?
Diana ? Oui, bien sûr.
C'est ma partenaire et mon amie.
Tu as déjà fantasmé sur elle ?
Une fois ou deux.
On travaillait tard.
Diana disait qu'il ne restait
que nous deux dans le bâtiment...
Tu peux venir.
Peter Barton, je suis l'agent Baldwin.
Voici l'agent Skouris, du NTAC.
Mon Dieu, non... pas elle.
Vous avez assassiné Colin,
n'est-ce pas ?
Assassiné ?
Non.
Je n'étais même pas dans la pièce
quand votre ami est arrivé.
L'argent.
Ce n'était pas moi votre cible,
mais l'entreprise.
Je devais les avertir.
Le pot-de-vin.
À qui l'avez-vous donné ?
Si je vous le dis, je suis viré.
Comment s'appelait-il, Peter ?
Alex Lupone.
C'est le responsable
des systèmes de combat avancés
du Pentagone.
Demande-lui
pourquoi ANEXXO soudoyait Lupone.
Non, attendez...
Non.
ANEXXO a remporté un contrat
pour développer une nouvelle
armure pare-balles pour l'armée.
Elle devait être impénétrable.
Et cette armure était défectueuse ?
Il y avait des défauts de conception
laissant les flancs...
et les épaules sans protection.
Je devais payer Lupone
pour qu'il ferme les yeux là-dessus.
Vous êtes intervenus,
et j'ai perdu le contrôle.
À qui avez-vous parlé
de Colin et April ?
Donald Mitchell,
membre du conseil d'administration.
Il m'a appelé personnellement
pour gérer le paiement.
Il a payé l'avion jusqu'ici
avec les fonds d'ANEXXO.
Où peut-on trouver Mitchell ?
Il a une chambre
à l'hôtel Dorchester.
Je ne savais pas
que des gens allaient mourir.
<i>Je n'ai aucun plaisir à apparaître ici
pour traiter Roland Lenhoff de menteur,</i>
<i>mais la vérité,
c'est qu'il ment depuis 40 ans.</i>
<i>Il n'a pas repoussé à lui seul
une patrouille de Viet Congs</i>
<i>alors que ses hommes
gisaient blessés à terre.</i>
<i>Je le sais,
car j'étais l'un de ces hommes.
Éteignez cette maudite télé.
<i>... réalisé par le sergent Stephen...</i>
Il semble que mes collègues
ont eu vent de notre rencontre.
Ils n'ont pas tardé à me montrer
leur désaccord.
Sénateur,
je dois vous demander,
- avez-vous menti sur les faits ?
- Non, pas du tout.
Ce type qui vient de parler...
j'ai sauvé sa vie ce jour-là.
Ils ont dû bien l'arroser
pour qu'il mente ainsi.
Je pense que
si ce qu'il dit est faux,
alors, ce n'est pas important.
Peu importe que ce soit vrai.
C'est de la télévision.
Je peux l'endurer.
La question est : et vous ?
Car vous allez avoir droit
au même genre de traitement.
Si ce n'est pire.
Les gens mentent à mon sujet
depuis notre retour
dans cette bulle de lumière, alors...
Cela veut-il dire
que vous êtes candidat ?
Je suis candidat
et je vais gagner.
C'est ce que je voulais entendre.
Je savais que j'avais choisi
la bonne personne.
Et maintenant ?
La première chose à faire,
est de faire connaître votre position.
C'est-à-dire, annoncer
que vous êtes contre Jordan Collier
et toutes ses actions.
Vous voulez gagner
cette élection ?
Alors, Jordan Collier est l'ennemi.
Votre ennemi.
- Salut, Kyle.
- Salut.
Ça avance ?
J'essaie de déchiffrer
ces pages codées, mais...
je ne suis pas cryptographe.
Je peux jeter un oeil ?
J'ai peut-être perdu mes capacités,
mais...
j'ai lu une encyclopédie de A à Z.
Et tu te souviens de tout ?
Oui, en gros.
T'es forte en énigmes ?
On va bien voir.
Tu dis m'avoir amenée ici
pour une raison, non ?
Que j'ai un rôle à jouer.
Alors, c'est peut-être
l'occasion de le prouver.
Je me contrefiche
de ce que Peter Barton affirme.
ANEXXO ne soudoie aucun membre
du gouvernement.
Ce n'est pas notre manière de faire.
M. Mitchell, avez-vous
autorisé le paiement
- de 300 000 $ à Alex Lupone ?
- Absolument pas.
On n'a jamais versé un centime
à Alex Lupone.
Maintenant, si vous permettez,
j'ai un filet de boeuf à 80 $
qui refroidit dans mon assiette.
- Alors, à quoi a servi l'argent ?
- C'était un acompte.
Un acompte pour quoi ?
Pour faire assassiner
Alex Lupone.
Je n'ai pas voulu dire ça.
Pourquoi dirais-je ça ?
Pourquoi faire tuer Lupone ?
Je ne répondrai à aucune
autre question.
Est-ce à cause de la vente d'armures
défectueuses à l'armée ?
Lupone nous aurait mis en danger.
On n'avait pas le choix.
- J'appelle mon avocat.
- Non.
Pas avant d'avoir annulé
le contrat sur Lupone.
Je ne vois pas
de quoi vous parlez.
Comment contacter Lupone ?
- Quel est son numéro de téléphone ?
- Il n'en a pas.
Il est en vacances
dans la jungle brésilienne.
Nos hommes sont déjà sur place.
Je n'ai aucun moyen
de les contacter.
Est-ce vraiment nécessaire ?
Absolument, oui.
Que fait-on maintenant ?
On va contacter
les autorités brésiliennes
en espérant qu'ils arrivent
à joindre Lupone en premier.
Mais en attendant,
il faut que tu viennes au NTAC
pour s'assurer que Mitchell
répète sa confession
pour le rapport.
Je ne peux pas. Si je vais au NTAC,
je n'en sortirai jamais.
Non, j'expliquerai les circonstances
à Meghan.
Et si ça ne marche pas ?
C'est trop risqué.
April, sans l'aide de tes capacités,
Mitchell va réfuter
tout ce qu'il vient de nous dire.
Il va s'en sortir et ne sera pas
inculpé pour le meurtre de Colin.
- C'est ce que tu veux ?
- Écoute, je ne peux pas.
- Je suis désolée.
- April, tu as fui toute ta vie.
Tu as fui ta famille, ton école,
tes responsabilités.
Et peut-être...
Peut-être que c'est de ma faute.
Peut-être que je t'ai rejetée,
que je n'étais pas là pour toi.
Je ne sais pas.
Mais cette fois-ci...
Cette fois, tu ne peux pas fuir.
Regarde-moi bien.
<i>OK. Passons maintenant
aux questions embarrassantes.</i>
Croyez-vous que le citoyen moyen
est prêt à voter pour un 4400 ?
Eh bien, je l'espère,
étant donné qu'ils sont plus nombreux
que ceux qui possèdent des capacités.
Mais de plus en plus de gens
prennent des doses chaque jour.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Soutenez-vous la décision
de Jordan Collier
de distribuer la promicine
à qui en veut ?
Non. Pas du tout.
La moitié de ces personnes
vont mourir.
Des milliers sont déjà mortes.
Selon vous, Jordan Collier
serait responsable de tous ces décès ?
Je crois que Jordan...
aurait dû attendre que les chances
de survie soient meilleures que 50-50.
Bien meilleures que 50-50.
S'il voulait changer le monde,
il y a des façons
moins dangereuses de le faire.
Comme se présenter
au conseil municipal ?
C'est un début en tout cas.
<i>April, c'est moi.</i>
- Va-t'en.
- <i>Pas avant qu'on ait parlé.</i>
<i>Laisse-moi entrer.</i>
<i>Allez, ouvre.</i>
Où vas-tu aller cette fois ?
Je n'ai pas vraiment réfléchi
aussi loin.
Je ne le fais jamais, pas vrai ?
Peut-être que cette fois,
tu devrais.
Tu veux entendre
un truc marrant ?
J'ai cru,
quand j'ai développé cette aptitude,
que ça allait changer ma vie.
Et ça a été le cas.
Ça a changé mon train de vie,
en tout cas.
J'ai de plus beaux habits.
Je mange
dans de meilleurs restaurants.
Je voyage en première classe
pour la première fois de ma vie.
Mais moi, je n'ai pas changé.
Aucune aptitude ne te changera.
C'est à toi de le faire.
Et tu en es capable.
Comment ?
En me rendant au NTAC ?
Ce serait courageux.
Mais je ne suis pas courageuse,
n'est-ce pas ?
C'est un de mes nombreux défauts.
Il n'est pas trop tard.
Tu peux encore devenir
celle que tu souhaites.
Écoute, je...
Je peux pas dire que j'approuve
ce que tu as fait.
Mais tu as dit que
tu aimais cet homme, Colin.
Et si c'est le cas,
si c'est vrai,
alors, tu dois faire ça pour lui.
Toi seule, peux le faire.
Cet homme est un criminel,
et il menace de nous poursuivre ?
Mitchell se plaint de harcèlement,
intimidation, et arrestation abusive.
Et les avocats d'ANEXXO sont capables
de monter un dossier en béton.
Enfin, Meghan.
Il a un meurtre à son actif,
en a organisé deux autres,
sa société tente d'arnaquer
notre gouvernement,
et on va le laisser partir ?
Cet homme devrait être enfermé,
je suis prête à vous croire,
mais votre parole ne me suffit pas.
Il me faut cette femme,
celle qui a obtenu ses aveux.
Je sais
qu'elle est positive à la promicine,
mais vous devez
la convaincre de venir.
Je doute que ça arrive.
Alors, on ne pourra pas
inculper Mitchell.
Pas sans preuve.
Voici la preuve qu'il vous faut.
Salut, Kyle.
- Tout va bien ?
- Non, pas vraiment.
J'étais dans ma voiture,
j'allume la radio,
et je t'entends dire
que Jordan Collier est un meurtrier ?
J'ai pas dit ça.
J'ai dit qu'il avait eu tort
de distribuer la promicine.
Et je le pense.
Tout ce que tu es,
cet endroit,
tu le dois à Jordan.
Tu le trahirais
pour quelques voix ?
J'ai autant contribué à construire
cet endroit que Jordan.
Il s'est servi de mes capacités
pour réunir de l'argent.
Il s'est servi de moi
à plusieurs occasions.
Ça n'arrivera plus.
J'agis seul, maintenant.
Je fais mes propres choix.
T'es bien parti.
Non seulement, tu trahis Jordan,
mais tu te trahis, toi-même.
Tu es un traître, Shawn.
Tu t'en rends compte ?
Tu t'en rends compte ?
Traître.
<i>INTERROGATOIRE EN COURS</i>
Ça fait combien de temps ?
Depuis que tu m'as demandé,
10 minutes environ.
Depuis que ta soeur est là-dedans
avec Mitchell, environ 2 h.
Mitchell bosse pour ANEXXO
depuis quoi, 14 ans ?
Imagine le nombre de secrets
qu'il a dû garder.
On risque d'y passer la nuit.
On a ses aveux signés.
Il faut voir si ça suffira
devant un tribunal, mais...
On en a assez contre lui pour que
quelques charges soient retenues.
- Et pour April ?
- Désolée, Diana,
on est obligés de l'arrêter.
C'est bon, Di.
Tout va bien.
J'ai pas dit que j'étais d'accord
non plus, mais...
Vous avez dû être convaincante.
Désolée de vous interrompre,
je n'ai pas réussi à dormir,
et tout ceci est très injuste
pour April.
Elle n'était pas obligée de venir.
Mitchell pourrait être en liberté,
au lieu d'avoir son visage
dans tous les journaux.
Mais non, elle a fait ce qu'il fallait,
et on l'enferme ?
On devrait lui offrir une amnistie,
pas la punir.
Skouris, on ne va pas la punir.
On l'embauche.
D'après Meghan,
NTAC...
Le ministère de la Justice...
Le FBI...
Ils sont tous en train de se battre
pour m'avoir.
Et tout ce que j'ai à faire,
c'est de poser des questions.
Ce sera pas toujours
une partie de plaisir.
Les personnes que tu rencontreras,
les questions que tu poseras...
les réponses que tu entendras...
Tout ça peut devenir insupportable.
Meghan a été très claire à ce sujet.
Mais bon,
ce sera toujours mieux que la prison.
Et les avantages valent le coup.
J'ai un appartement,
un bon salaire,
une assurance maladie,
et même une indemnité
pour mes fringues.
Et n'oublions pas Eric et Ralph.
Ou plutôt Ralph et Eric ?
Tu trouveras.
Leur boulot, c'est de s'assurer
que je sois là où c'est nécessaire.
Me connaissant, ce sera pas aussi facile
que ça en a l'air.
Tu crois que je vais tout foirer,
c'est ça ?
Peut-être que la question à me poser
c'est si je veux que tu réussisses,
et la réponse est un grand oui.
J'essaierai de pas nous décevoir.
Je te promets d'appeler ou d'écrire,
pour que tu saches
comment je m'en sors.
Alors...
Tu pars quand ?
En Espagne,
ou où que vous choisissiez d'aller ?
Je ne pars pas.
Je reste ici, à Seattle.
J'ai vraiment dit ça ?
Ben est au courant ?
Non, je viens de le réaliser.
Tu vas devoir lui dire.
Je suis très heureux pour vous deux.
Vraiment, mais...
On ne quittera pas cette table
avant de s'être décidés.
La France ou l'Espagne ?
Ni l'un, ni l'autre.
Ne m'en veux pas, Ben.
Je t'en prie.
Oh, Seigneur...
J'ai démissionné.
Je suis allée en Espagne.
J'ai essayé.
J'ai vraiment essayé, mais...
mais ma place est ici.
Avec Tom, le NTAC,
la traque de Collier.
Je fais partie de tout ça.
Ma fille fait partie de tout ça.
Et maintenant,
ma soeur aussi.
Et nous, on devient quoi ?
On reprend chacun notre vie ?
On reprend nos boulots ?
On se voit
deux, trois jours par mois ?
Pour l'instant.
On pourrait avoir
tellement plus, Diana.
Maia a dit
qu'on allait se marier.
Et Maia ne se trompe jamais.
J'espère bien.
Moi aussi.
Les résultats des tests
que tu as demandés.
Le seul et unique exemplaire.
Positif à la promicine.
C'est sûr, quelqu'un se balade
avec une capacité.
Merci, Marco.
"Quand les élus auront reçu l'élixir,
"et auront prouvé leur foi
envers le Messie,
"alors, tous suivront leurs pas.
"C'est alors que le Père révélera
son vrai visage,
"et que le Paradis et la Terre
ne feront plus qu'un."
Je pense que la traduction
est assez fidèle.
L'élixir,
ça doit être la promicine.
Et on sait que Collier est censé être
le Messie.
Et le Père ?
Je sais pas. Dieu, non ?
- Mais, qui sont les élus ?
- Tourne la page.
C'est une liste de noms.
Ouais, 200 en tout.
Tu reconnaîtras
la plupart d'entre eux.
Des politiciens,
scientifiques, sportifs...
Ces gens,
ils vivent à notre époque.
Mais ce livre a été écrit
il y a 80 ans.
Je sais.
Très bien, alors...
Tous ces gens
doivent prendre de la promicine ?
Et...
C'est censé pousser les gens
à faire la même chose, c'est ça ?
Jusqu'à ce que quoi ?
Tout le monde développe une capacité ?
Ceux qui survivront, en tout cas.
Et c'est là que Dieu arrive...
Tu devrais regarder le dernier nom.
Mon père ?
Il doit prendre de la promicine ?
Si tu crois à la prophétie...
au Paradis sur Terre,
avec Jordan Collier à sa tête...
Alors oui,
ton père devra prendre
de la promicine.

- Who's Cassie?
- I'm Kyle's ability.
<i>You ever go visit
your cousin, Shawn?
<i>Maybe someone should try injecting him
with a big old dose of promicin.
It's all about to happen.
What's going to happen?
Thumb through the book,
if you'd like.
A lot of it is written
in a code or something.
- Maia, this is my friend, Ben.
- I've heard a lot about you.
You saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?
These shots are free.
Give them to anyone
who wants them,
but be careful
to explain the risks.
There are no guarantees.
There never are.
Is this seat taken?
It is now.
I'm April,
by the way.
Peter. Barton.
So, what's good tonight?
I recommend
the lemon drop martini.
Bartender,
can I get two more?
Is that okay?
I don't want you to think
I'm hitting on you or anything.
So, what do you do, Peter?
I'm V.P. of client relations
for ANEXXO.
We're in the fortune 500.
Energy. Communications.
Some defense work...
I get it. You're one of the guys
that runs the world.
Me? No, but...
I work for those guys.
So, what brings you to Seattle?
The company's in the midst
of a major project, and...
they hit a little snag, so...
I'm here to do some triage.
You're going to save the day?
Hopefully.
And how are you going
to do that?
I'm gonna bribe someone
to look the other way.
I can't believe
I just told you that.
Look, do me a favor...
- forget what I just said.
- It's already forgotten.
So, how much money
are we talking about?
$300,000. I'm picking it up
tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, my God.
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this stuff.
Did they put something
in this drink?
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm just a girl you met in a bar.
Don't ask me
any more questions, okay?
What room are you in, Peter?
315.
What I just told you,
don't repeat it.
It would be bad for you,
for me, for...
everyone.
Let me guess...
- The truth hurts.
- It usually does.
So what do we got?
Cheating husband? Tax fraud...
Try corporate intrigue.
Try bribery.
Try $300,000
arriving tomorrow.
- Room 315.
- 300 grand?
Baby, you're good.
Wow. Okay.
All right, so we'll hit him up
for 20% to keep quiet.
That's... 60,000 bucks.
Love me?
I do.
And it's not like
I can lie to you.
No, you can't.
No one can.
Glad I remembered
this place.
I had a lot of fun summers
up here when I was a kid.
It's pretty much
a ghost town till june, which is...
a good thing, because
the whole world's looking for you.
Maybe I should just
turn myself in.
Spend the rest of your life in prison?
I don't think so.
It was no coincidence
I was there when that van crashed.
I was sent
to help you get away.
This is all happening
for a reason.
And what would that be?
Truthfully, I'm not sure yet.
Maybe the answers are in this book.
I just hope they're not in this code,
or whatever this is.
Do you believe that
Jordan Collier is a Messiah?
And that promicin's
gonna save the world?
Yeah, I do.
Even if that's true,
what does it have to do with me?
My abilities are gone.
My body can't tolerate promicin.
I'm the enemy. I hurt shawn.
I tried to kill Jordan Collier.
I did kill Jordan.
Believe me.
I know what it feels like...
to be in prison and think
you're never getting out.
To feel you've done things
that no one will ever forgive you for.
But no one's so far gone
that they can't be forgiven,
don't have a role to play
In this new world of Jordan Collier's.
I'm meant to be
a part of that world.
To help bring it about,
and so are you.
Colin?
You're a hard woman
to find, April.
I've been looking everywhere
for you.
Well, you found me, Di.
Now what are you gonna do

It wasn't terribly smart using
mom's maiden name on your credit card.
If I'd known you were gonna come
looking for me,
then I would have been
more creative.
I can only imagine how pissed off
you must've been
when you'd heard
I'd taken the shot.
I wasn't terribly happy about it,
you're right.
But you are my sister,
and I was very worried about you.
Besides, I knew you never would have
taken the shot...
if it hadn't been for what happened
between Ben and me.
Feeling a little guilty, are we?
Well, don't.
You and Ben
may be why I did it...
But taking the shot
was the right thing for me to do.
I've got money, clothes,
a great guy, Colin,
who loves me,
and a pretty great ability.
How many times a week
are you and Ben having sex?
Three.
Wait, that's not...
- That is none of your business.
- I know.
And you told me anyway.
That's my ability.
I ask a question,
you tell the truth...
every time.
That's a pretty interesting ability.
It doesn't work on you, does it?
You mean make me
tell the truth?
Thankfully, no.
What am I gonna do
with you, April?
What am I gonna do
with you?
Go back to Spain, Di.
Any guilt you feel
about you and Ben...
Consider yourself
absolved.
Enjoy your life...
and let me enjoy mine.
That's wonderful, dad.
I'm so glad you're walking better.
I can't wait to see it.
I have to go.
I love you, too.
Garrity said
you wanted to see me.
Have you seen the doctor's final report
on your nephew's recovery?
Yes, I have.
Well, now so has D.C.
Those high levels of promicin
that were found in his system...
People are wondering
where they came from.
Yeah. Beats me.
Come on, Tom.
Someone
walked into the hospital
and gave your nephew
a massive dose of promicin.
Your sister and your son
were the only ones with him at the time.
Now I'm willing to dismiss Susan
as a suspect,
but I think you need
to have a talk with Kyle.
Excuse me?
Mr. Farrell.
Senator Lenhoff's
here to see you.
Senator Lenhoff?
Are you sure?
She's sure. I'm sure. And I can see
you're beginning to believe it yourself.
Roland Lenhoff.
The devil made flesh.
We need to talk.
In private.
Senator, if you're here
to try to force me
- to shut down the center again...
- Relax, Farrell.
I don't want
to shut this place, hell!
I want you to heal
as many people as possible,
which is surprising, I know.
After all...
I'm the guy that passed the bill
forcing all you 4400s
to register your abilities.
And you were
just warming up.
I seem to remember one speech
where you said
that if it were up to you,
we'd all be living behind barbed wire.
I knew you were
going to bring that up.
Have a seat.
Come on, sit down.
I'll admit...
I have been waging
a kind of war against you.
Trouble is,
I just chaired a committee,
which is about to issue
a 1600-page report,
which states,
in no uncertain terms,
that I'm losing that war
and you are winning it.
Promicin
isn't going away.
Jordan Collier
made damn sure of that.
If you're here
to sign terms of surrender,
- I could have some drawn up.
- Who's talking about surrender?
I fought in 'nam.
I have the medals to prove it.
And last year,
I took my wife
on vacation to Saigon.
I figure if I can make my peace
with Charlie,
I can make my peace with you.
They're holding
a special election
to fill a vacant seat
on the Seattle city council.
I want you to run for it.
City council?
Senator, I'm not a politician.
The hell you're not.
You stepped into the spotlight
when you reopened this center.
I want you to leverage
some of the good work
that you've been doing here
into something more.
You're the alternative we need
to Collier and his
promicin-pushing radicals.
You can walk the middle path
that will unite both 4400s
and non-4400s.
And this middle path?
You're planning on walking it with me?
Right down the center.
Probably lose any chance
of re-election.
My anti-4400 colleagues
will see to that.
But it's what
the country needs.
What the world needs.
So, what do you say,
Farrell?
You ready
to dance with the devil?
You should've seen
that hotel suite.
It must run
at $600 or $700 a night.
The dress, the shoes.
Moving around from city to city.
This ability of hers,
however she's using it,
she's going to get herself into trouble.
What are you
smiling about?
Diana, come on,
April's alive.
The shot didn't kill her.
She's not even living on the street.
She's even involved with a guy.
This is... a win.
It just doesn't
feel like a win.
She's going to screw up.
NTAC are going to get a hold of her,
and then what?
Listen to me.
Come here for a second.
You traveled 6,000 miles
to find your sister, right?
You offered her help.
She refused.
It's over.
And now we can move back
to Spain.
I guess we can.
- You guess?
- No, I mean... we will.
It will take a little time.
I mean, the whole work thing.
Come on, Diana,
it's not that complicated.
All you got to do is go in there,
turn in your gun and badge,
and we're on a plane
by tomorrow.
I can't just do that.
Not to Tom, to Meghan.
You just give me a week or so
and then we're out of here.
- We'll tell Maia tonight?
- Yeah. As soon as we get home.
You're sure you don't want me
to go with you to pick up the money?
Nah, you'd just freak
the guy out.
Barton knows you put some kind
of whammy on him, right?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Still thinking
about your sister?
I just can't believe she came
all that way to look for me.
I didn't think she cared enough.
April, she's a judgmental bitch,
and I say good riddance.
Besides, you don't need her anymore.
You got me.
So what do you say we meet in the bar
a little after 7:00,
- for a celebratory cocktail?
- Okay.
Where are we off to next?
I figured we'd go crash
with my brother in south beach.
He just moved there
from Phoenix.
Jeff says there's
money to be made in Miami.
People there are holding onto
all kinds of dirty little secrets.
Dirty little secrets.
Got a minute, buddy?
Not really.
I'm meeting some friends.
It's about Shawn.
What about him?
The way he woke up from his coma
with all that promicin in him.
People are starting to wonder
if you had something to do with it.
By people, do you mean NTAC?
What exactly
are you accusing me of, dad?
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I'm asking you.
The day at the hospital,
did you give your cousin
a shot of promicin?
No, I didn't.
Kyle, listen to me.
- If you're involved in something.
- In what ?
I don't know. Last few nights,
you haven't come home...
- Dad, I'm 23 years old.
- I know that.
Kyle, if you're holding
anything back,
Please...
tell me now.
I got nothing to say.
Except I'm glad
Shawn's up and about.
For all I know, whatever isabelle
zapped him with, it wore off.
Or not.
I guess we'll never know
the truth, will we?
We all got to get used to that.
Can I go now?
<i>This is Colin.
Leave a message.
Colin?
Babe?
It's colin!
He's been shot!
There was so much blood.
Maia, will you go to bed now,
please, sweetie?
Help me, Di.
Please, help me.
April, did you honestly believe
that this guy, Barton,
was just gonna hand
you over $60,000?
Seemed like such an easy mark
and it's always worked before.
So that's how you've
been using your ability?
- To blackmail people.
- Oh, God.
Don't start lecturing me
on right and wrong.
- No, it's a little late for that.
- Yeah. It is.
- So save your breath.
- All right, ladies, just calm down.
Let's just stay calm, okay?
Focus on what's
important right now.
Barton?
He did it, right?
He killed colin?
Well, I would say
he's our number one suspect.
But this $300,000
that ANEXXO's paying out
in bribe money...
Barton didn't happen to mention
where it was going?
Does it matter?
Colin, the way he looked
lying there on the floor...
The hotel suite.
It was in Colin's name, right?
Yeah.
Or one of his names.
He used a couple.
And when they find the body,
there's nothing there
to connect you to it,
is there?
I don't think so.
Ben, will you stay here?
I'm gonna drive April
to a motel,
or somewhere away from here
and away from Maia.
I'm sorry, you'll have to stay there
until we figure this out.
Are you going to turn me in?
We just have to make this up
as we go along.
So I can count on you, right?
If my dad asks you,
and he probably will...
I'm not going to tell your dad
that you gave me a promicin shot.
It's hard, you know?
I mean, I love the guy so much,
but the things I'm doing,
- he just wouldn't understand.
- I get it, Kyle.
I really do.
It's just I've got...
all of this other stuff
I'm dealing with.
If you mean Isabelle Tyler,
don't think you have to worry about her.
- She's probably long gone from Seattle.
- That's good to know.
I'll fire the extra security
I had on.
Anyway, I wasn't
talking about her.
This is going
to sound weird.
Roland Lenhoff...
wants me to run for a seat
on the city council.
The guy behind
the Dinstman-Lenhoff bill?
He sees it as a "If you can't beat 'em,
work with 'em" kind of thing.
And he knows he can't beat us.
That's great, Shawn.
- You said yes, right?
- I'm thinking about it.
You have to do this.
You get elected,
that puts a 4400 into the mainstream.
They'll have to start
taking us seriously.
Who knows? You could become mayor,
maybe even governor.
Just one step at a time.
I don't even know if I can get
elected to city council.
You heal people with your hands.
Show me an opponent
who can beat that.
- Do you wanna be my campaign manager?
- No.
But you got my vote.
That's one.
Not a problem.
I'll have the test results
back tomorrow.
- What name do I log the samples under?
- No name.
- What if they're promicin positive?
- No name, Marco.
I want any paperwork
handed to me and me alone.
Are we clear?
Actually, Tom,
I still have some questions.
Do me this favor, please.
But I won't ask them.
Thank you.
Hey, Marco.
They told me you were down here, Tom.
- Have you got a minute?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
I know my sister's made
a lot of bad choices in her life,
but I also know that April
would never have taken that shot
if it weren't for me.
I understand you want
to protect your sister, Diana,
but if she knows
the identity of a murderer...
I can't be responsible
for sending April to prison, Tom.
She's promicin positive.
It's a life sentence.
You know the deal.
Besides, I mean,
there's a chance
that the police could get
to Barton on their own.
But what if they don't?
What then?
Then I'll tell the authorities
everything I know.
After I've bought April
a one-way ticket to Marrakech.
April Skouris, right?
I'm a friend of Colin's brother, Jeff.
- Jeff?
- No, I'm Larry,
but Jeff heard what happened
and he...
He sent me here
to get you outta Seattle.
Really? Well, where
are we going to go?
My car's right out back.
We're gonna go to Phoenix.
- What about my clothes?
- You can get some new ones, ok?
If we hurry,
we can catch the next flight.
Wait, Phoenix?
Jeff moved to Florida.
- It really doesn't matter.
- Oh, my god, help!
He's trying to kill me!
Help! Help!
Di, I really need to know
what's going on
because none of this
makes any sense.
Why kill Colin?
Why come after me?
We never got our hands
on any of that money.
Well, that bribe money
that ANEXXO is paying out,
they clearly don't want anyone
knowing about it.
I guess it's time we have a talk
with this Peter Barton guy.
I'm coming with you.
You want the truth?
I can get it for you.
You sure about that?
I mean...
People beat lie detectors
all the time.
Tom, do you like my sister?
Diana? Yeah, sure.
She's my partner, my friend.
Ever had a sexual fantasy about her?
Once or twice.
We were working late.
Diana mentioned we were the only
two people working in the building...
You can come.
Peter Barton,
I'm agent Baldwin.
This is agent Skouris.
We're with NTAC.
Oh, God, not her.
You murdered Colin, didn't you?
Murdered? No.
I wasn't even in the room
when your boyfriend showed up.
The money.
It wasn't me
you were trying to blackmail.
It was the corporation.
I had to warn them.
The bribe money.
Who'd you pass it off to?
I tell you that, I lose my job.
What was his name, Peter?
Alex Lupone.
He's the director of advanced
combat systems for the pentagon.
Ask him why ANEXXO
was paying Lupone.
Don't. Just...
Don't.
ANEXXO won a contract
to develop
a new interceptor ballistic
body armor for the military.
It was supposed to be impenetrable.
So this body armor,
it was defective?
There were some design flaws
which left parts of the side
and shoulders unprotected.
I was supposed to pay off Lupone
to look the other way.
You interfered,
and it was taken
out of my hands.
Who did you tell
about Colin and April?
Donald Mitchell. He sits
on our board of directors.
He called me personally
to handle the payoff.
Flew me out here
on ANEXXO's dime.
Where can we find Mitchell?
He's staying at
the Dorchester hotel.
I didn't know anyone
was gonna die.
<i>I don't like
standing up here</i>
<i>and calling Roland Lenhoff
a liar,</i>
<i>but the truth is,
he's been one for 40 years.</i>
<i>He did not single-handedly</i>
<i>hold off a platoon
of viet cong troops</i>
<i>while his men
lay wounded around him.</i>
<i>I know that for a fact
because I was one of those men.</i>
Turn that damned thing off.
<i>...performed
by staff sergeant Stephen...</i>
Guess some of my colleagues
heard that you and I
were meeting.
Didn't waste any time
letting me know
they weren't
real happy about it.
Senator,
I have to ask,
did you falsify your war record?
No, I did not.
That fellow who gave
that little speech...
I saved his life that day.
They must've paid him a lot of money
to get him to lie like that.
Well, I guess
if what he says isn't true,
then it doesn't really matter.
Doesn't have to be true.
It's on the television.
I can tough this out.
The question is, can you?
'Cause they're gonna be giving you
the same kind of treatment.
If not worse.
People have been
telling lies about me
ever since we came back
in that ball of light, so...
Does that mean
you'll run for city council?
It means I'm gonna run
and I'm gonna win.
That's what I wanted to hear.
I knew I picked myself
the right man.
So what happens now?
The first thing
you got to do
is let people know
where you stand.
That means telling the world
you're against Jordan Collier
and everything
that he's been doing.
You want to win this election?
Then Jordan Collier is the enemy.
Your enemy.
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey.
How's it coming?
I'm trying to decipher
these coded pages,
but I'm not a cryptographer.
Can I have a look?
I may have lost my abilities,
but I did read
the encyclopedia from A to Z.
And you remember all of it?
Yeah, pretty much.
How are you with puzzles?
Well, I guess we'll see.
But you did say you brought me
here for a reason, right?
That I'm part of all this.
So maybe this is my chance
to prove it.
I don't care
what Peter Barton claims.
ANEXXO doesn't bribe
government officials.
That's not the way
we conduct business.
Mr. Mitchell,
did you authorize the payment
of $300,000 to Alex Lupone?
I did not.
We never paid
Alex Lupone a penny.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have an $80 kobe beef filet
growing cold on the plate.
- Then what was the money for?
- It was a down payment.
A down payment for what?
To have Alex Lupone murdered.
I didn't mean that.
I don't know why
I'd say such a thing.
Why have Lupone killed?
I'm not answering
any more questions.
Was it because you were selling
the military defective body armor?
Lupone would have exposed us.
we had no choice.
- I'm calling my lawyer.
- No.
Not till you cancel
the hit on Lupone.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
How do we reach Lupone?
- What is his phone number?
- There isn't one.
He's on vacation
in the Brazilian jungle.
The men we hired
are already down there.
I have no way
of contacting them.
Is this really necessary?
Absolutely, it is.
So what do we do now?
Well, we'll get in touch
with the Brazilian authorities
and hope that they get in touch
with Lupone first.
But in the meantime,
I'm going to need you
to come into NTAC
and make sure that Mitchell
repeats his confession
for the record.
I can't do that.
I walk into NTAC,
I don't come out.
No, I'll speak to Meghan.
We'll explain the circumstances.
What if that doesn't work?
Can't take that chance.
April, without some coaxing
from your ability,
Mitchell is going to deny
everything he just told us.
He's going to get away with murder.
He's gonna get away with Colin's murder.
- Do you want that?
- Look, I can't do that.
- I'm sorry.
- April, you've been running away
your entire life.
From your family, from school,
from responsibility.
And I don't know, maybe I'm...
Maybe I'm to blame for that.
Maybe I pushed you away.
Maybe I wasn't there for you.
I don't know.
But this time...
This time, you can't run away.
Watch me.
<i>All right. Time to get
to the tough questions.</i>
Do you think the average citizen
is ready to vote for a 4400?
Well, I'm hoping so,
being there's a lot more non-4400s
out there than people with abilities.
But more people
are taking the shot all the time.
How do you feel about that?
Do you agree with
Jordan Collier's decision
to hand out promicin
to anybody who wants it?
No. I don't.
Half of those people
are going to die.
Thousands already have.
Are you calling Jordan Collier
a mass murderer?
I think that Jordan...
should've waited until the odds
of survival were better than 50/50.
A lot better than 50/50.
If he wanted to change the world,
there are safer ways
of doing so.
Like running for city council?
Well, that's a start anyway.
<i>April, it's me.</i>
- Go away.
- <i>Not until we've talked.</i>
<i>Now just let me in.</i>
<i>Come on, open up.</i>
So where do you go now?
I really hadn't thought
that far ahead.
I never do, do I?
Maybe this time you should.
You want to hear
something funny?
I thought when
I got this ability,
it would change my life.
And it did.
Changed my circumstances anyway.
I got better clothes.
I eat in better restaurants.
Fly first-class
for the first time in my life.
But it didn't change me.
No ability is going to do that.
You have to change yourself.
And you can.
How?
By marching into NTAC?
That would be brave.
Except I'm not brave, am I?
Another one of my many faults.
It's not too late.
You can still be the person
that you want to be.
Look, I...
I can't say that I approve
of what you've been up to.
But you did say that
you loved this guy, Colin.
And if you did,
if that's true,
then you have to
speak up for him.
And only you can do that.
The man is guilty of multiple felonies
and he's threatening to sue us?
Mitchell's claiming harassment,
intimidation, oh, and false arrest.
And ANEXXO's lawyers have the muscle
to make a case like this stick.
Come on, Meghan.
He's responsible for
one murder we know of,
he plotted two others,
and his corporation is trying
to defraud the U.S. government,
and we're just
gonna let him walk?
You tell me this guy deserves to be
locked up and I'll believe you,
but I need more than your word.
I need that woman, the one
that got his initial confession.
Look, I know
she's promicin positive,
but you need to convince
her to come forward.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Then there's no way we're going
to get an indictment against Mitchell.
Not without proof.
I have the proof
you need right here.
Hey, Kyle.
- Everything all right?
- No, it's not.
I'm driving in my car,
turn on the radio,
and I hear you tell the world that
Jordan Collier's a mass murderer.
That is not what I said.
I said that he was wrong
to hand out promicin.
And that's what I believe.
Everything that you are,
this building you're standing in,
you owe it all to Jordan.
You're willing to betray
him for some votes?
Hey, I built this place
just as much as Jordan.
He used my healing abilities
to raise money for it.
He used me for a lot of things.
Not anymore.
I'm my own man now.
I make my own choices.
Well, you're off to a great start.
You're not only
betraying Jordan,
you're betraying yourself.
You're a traitor, Shawn.
Don't you see that?
Don't you see that?
Traitor.
How long has it been?
Since the last time you asked,
about 10 minutes.
Since your sister's been in there
with Mitchell, about two hours.
Mitchell's been with ANEXXO
for what, 14 years?
Imagine the secrets
he's saved up.
We could be here all night.
We got a signed confession.
Whether it holds up in court
remains to be seen,
but we've got enough
against him
that at least a couple
of these charges should stick.
- And April?
- I'm sorry, Diana.
We have to take her
into custody.
It's okay, Di.
Everything's okay.
I didn't say
I'd go for it either but...
You must've been pretty convincing.
Excuse me,
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But I have been up all night
and what we're doing
to April just isn't fair.
She didn't have to come forward.
Mitchell could be
a free man right now,
instead of having his picture
plastered all over the papers.
But no, she did the right thing,
and we're locking her up?
We need to offer her some kind
of amnesty, not punish her.
Skouris, we're not punishing her.
We're hiring her.
According to Meghan,
NTAC...
The attorney general's office...
The FBI...
They're already fighting over
who gets me when.
And all I have to do
is ask people questions.
It's not always going to be
at a bar over drinks.
Some of the people you meet
and the questions
you have to ask...
Some of the answers
you're going to hear...
It can get pretty ugly.
Meghan was pretty upfront
about that.
Still, it's gotta be
better than prison.
I must say,
the perks are pretty good.
I get an apartment,
a nice salary,
health insurance,
even a clothing allowance.
And let's not forget
Eric and Ralph.
Or is it Ralph and Eric?
I'm sure
you'll figure it out.
Their job is to make sure
I show up
wherever I need to be.
Knowing me, it won't be
as easy as it sounds.
You think I'm gonna
screw this up, don't you?
April, maybe the question
you should be asking me is
if I want you to succeed,
and the answer
is a definite yes.
Well, I'll try not to let
either one of us down.
And I promise
to call or email
and let you know
how I'm doing.
So...
When are you leaving?
You know, for Spain,
or wherever you guys decide?
I'm not leaving.
I'm staying right
here in Seattle.
Did I just say that?
Does Ben know?
No. I hadn't realized it
until just now.
You're gonna
have to tell him.
I'm really happy
for both of you.
I really am. But...
we're not leaving this table
until we've made a decision.
Are we living in France or Spain?
Neither.
Diana?
Don't hate me, Ben. Please.
Oh, God...
I quit work.
I went to Spain.
I tried. I really tried.
But I belong here.
With Tom, and with NTAC,
the search for Collier.
I'm a part of that.
My daughter's a part of that.
And now my sister is, too.
So what happens to us?
We go back to our own lives?
Back to our work?
What, see each other
a few days a month?
For now.
We could have
so much more, Diana.
Maia said
that we'd get married.
And Maia's never wrong.
Well, I hope not.
Me too.
The lab report
you asked for.
The one and only copy.
Samples came back
positive for promicin.
Someone's definitely
walking around with an ability.
Thanks, Marco.
"When the chosen
have taken the elixir
"and proved their faith
in the Messiah,
"then all will follow
in their wake.
"Only then will the father
reveal his true face,
"and paradise and the world
will be as one."
I think that's a pretty
accurate translation.
The elixir,
that's gotta be promicin.
And we know Collier's
supposed to be the Messiah.
And the father?
I don't know. God, I guess?
- But who are the chosen?
- Flip the page.
It's a list of names.
Yeah. 200 in all.
And most of them
you'll recognize.
Politicians, scientists,
athletes...
These people,
they're all alive today.
But this book was written
85 years ago.
I know.
All right, so...
all these people
have to take the shot?
And...
That's supposed to influence
more and more people
to do the same, right?
Until what?
Everyone has an ability?
Those who survive, anyway.
And that's when god's
supposed to show up?
I think you'd better look
at the last name.
My dad?
He has to take the shot?
If you believe in the prophecy.
In some kind of
paradise on earth
led by Jordan Collier...
Then, yeah...
Your dad has to take promicin.

<i>Précédemment dans</i> Les 4400...
Vous êtes l'alternative

prônant la promicine.
Cela veut-il dire
que vous êtes candidat ?
Je suis candidat
et je vais gagner.
<i>La promicine se répand,</i>
<i>les gens acquièrent des capacités,

- Qui est Cassie ?
- Je ne suis pas vraiment réelle.
Je suis la capacité de Kyle.
<i>Tout ce qui figure dans ce livre

Collier conduira le genre humain

Tu l'y aideras.
Isabelle Tyler...
<i>J'ai fait beaucoup de mal,</i>
et je suis censée continuer.
J'ai été envoyé pour t'aider
à t'échapper. Tout ceci a un sens.
Tu crois vraiment que
Jordan Collier est le Messie ?
Et que la promicine sauvera le monde ?
Kyle, écoute-moi.
Si tu es impliqué là-dedans...
Les tests que tu as demandés
sont positifs à la promicine.
Salut, papa, quoi de neuf ?
<i>Où es-tu, Kyle ?</i>
Y a un problème ?
Il faut qu'on parle,
c'est important,
mais on doit se rencontrer.
Tu peux venir à la maison ?
Oui, bien sûr. Je serai là dans, quoi...
20 minutes à peu près.
- <i>Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?</i>
- 20 mn. Je serai là.
N'y retourne pas, Kyle.
Il sait.
Il sait quoi ?
À ton avis ?
Ton père sait
que tu as pris de la promicine.
Il va faire quoi ?
Me dénoncer au NTAC ?
Si je peux pas rentrer chez moi,
je vais aller où ?
Tu dois aller de l'avant.
Aller où ?
Dirige-toi vers le nord.
Prends l'autoroute 99,
jusqu'au croisement
de la départementale 57.
Tu la suis,
jusqu'à un ancien chemin forestier.
Au bout du chemin,
continue à pied, plein ouest.
Et je cherche quoi ?
Vas-y.
Ce sera la surprise.
J'ai entendu des voix.
Tout va bien ?
Prépare-toi, d'accord ?
On s'en va.
Ne les laissez pas m'emmener !
Ma puce...
tout va bien ?
Chérie, ça va aller.
Personne ne veut t'emmener.
Tu as fait un cauchemar.
Ça ressemble à une prison.
Tous ceux qui ont des capacités
sont là-bas.
Ils nous mettent en rangs,
et ils nous emmènent,
dans un endroit effrayant.
Quel genre d'endroit ?
Tu as déjà fait ce cauchemar ?
C'est la deuxième fois.
Je pensais qu'il passerait,
mais ça a recommencé.
Tout va bien, ma puce.
Viens par là.
C'est passé, mon bébé.
Qu'est-ce qu'on est censés chercher ?
On est au milieu de nulle part.
Cassie voulait qu'on vienne ici.
Il doit y avoir une raison.

Vous êtes sûr, c'est le dernier contact

Bon sang, juste pour une fois,

Écoute, je dois m'absenter un moment.
Kyle a des problèmes.

Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je ne sais pas, mais je dois le trouver,
il faut que tu me couvres.
Je viens d'avoir au téléphone
l'opérateur mobile de Kyle.
On a perdu la trace de son téléphone
il y a 4 h.
Ce sera long.
Peut-être 1 ou 2 jours.
Dis-moi ce qui ne va pas.
J'aimerais t'aider.
Le mieux à faire,
c'est de couvrir mon absence.
Dis-leur que je suis sur le terrain,
pour une de nos affaires, d'accord ?
Je t'appelle
dès que je le trouve.
Bonne chance.
Merci.
Mon Dieu !

Mon Dieu.
Tu m'as piégée.
Tu m'as conduite droit à lui.
Comment m'as-tu trouvé ?
J'ai pris une dose.
Depuis, j'ai des visions. Elles m'ont
guidé ici pour vous apporter...
C'est juste un bouquin, mec.
C'est important.
Ça vous concerne.
Lisez-le. Ça parle de ce...
mouvement religieux
fondé il y a 90 ans.
<i>Lumière Blanche</i>,
un culte selon eux.
Ce livre contient leur prophétie.
Tout est là :
la promicine, votre mouvement.
C'est pour ça
que je devais vous trouver.
Et elle ?
Tu étais censé guider Isabelle Tyler
jusqu'à moi, également ?
J'ai été guidé vers elle,
tout comme je l'ai été vers vous.
Elle apportera son aide
à votre mouvement, Jordan.
Je ne suis pas une menace.
Je n'ai plus aucune capacité.
À quoi pourrais-tu bien me servir ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est vous.
Je vous l'ai dit,
il n'est question que de vous.
Emmenez-les.
<i>M. Farrell bénéficie
de cette remarquable capacité, mais...</i>
<i>au fond de lui...</i>
<i>il n'est pas si différent
d'un autre jeune homme.</i>
<i>Et même s'il devait devenir
le nouveau Robert Kennedy,</i>
<i>je continuerais d'affirmer
qu'un 4400</i>
<i>n'a pas sa place
dans une institution publique.</i>
Les coupures du jour.
Je dois vraiment lire ces coupures ?
Tout le monde respecte
votre travail de guérison,
mais ils vous reprochent votre âge,
votre inexpérience
et votre manque d'éducation,
- vos liens avec Jordan Collier...
- C'est bon, j'ai compris.
Ai-je vraiment besoin d'étudier
mes propres défauts ?
Je me le demande.
Votre directeur de campagne
pense que oui.
Elle vous a pris un rendez-vous
avec Gabriel Hewitt aujourd'hui.
Vous devrez être capable
de réfuter ses...
arguments... Un par un.
Je dois rencontrer l'homme
qui n'hésite pas à me critiquer
dès qu'il peut parler
devant une caméra ?
Il s'agirait plutôt
de le convaincre.
Parlez-lui de la fondation.
Convainquez-le que vous n'êtes pas
à la solde de Jordan Collier.
Je t'admire, Kyle.
Avec ton entourage,
ça n'a pas dû être facile
de prendre de la promicine.
Mais j'ai lu ton livre.
Tout est faux.
- Je ne suis pas le Messie.
- Je vous comprends.
J'ai eu du mal à le croire aussi,
je ne suis pas un fervent religieux.
Mais mes visions se sont toujours
avérées vraies, à chaque fois.
Selon elles, ce livre est important.
Je les crois.
Je dois croire ce qui est écrit.
La promicine n'est pas uniquement
destinée à améliorer le monde, Jordan,
mais elle apportera
le Paradis sur Terre.
Je ne sais exactement
ce que ça signifie, mais...
vous avez un rôle à jouer,
et je suis censé vous aider.
Ainsi que c'est écrit dans le livre...
vous allez tous nous guider...
vers Dieu.
Détachez-le.
Nous continuerons
dans un endroit plus confortable.
Et moi ?
Je m'occuperai de toi
bien assez tôt.
Bonté divine,
un client qui m'est inconnu.
Cela tient du miracle.
Vous devez avoir peu de visiteurs.
Cette ville n'est même pas sur ma carte.
L'autoroute 2 a fermé
il y a quelques années.
Depuis, les visiteurs se font rares.
C'est une aubaine
d'en recevoir un aussi mignon.
Kathy, arrête de draguer
ce pauvre homme,
peut-être veut-il manger ?
C'est bon, merci.
Vous n'aurez pas fait tout ce chemin
sans goûter ma célèbre tarte aux pommes.
Dis-lui, Shannon, veux-tu ?
Kathy fait une tarte terrible.
C'est la spécialité maison.
Je n'en doute pas.
J'aimerais avoir le temps,
mais j'espérais trouver le shérif.
Il y avait une note sur la porte.
Il devrait transférer son bureau ici.
Merci.
Mon fils conduit une Saturn verte.
Il y a peu de raisons
de venir ici,
mais si je la vois,
je vous appellerai personnellement.
Mais si votre garçon
est passé par ici,
il a déjà dû repartir.
Vous pouvez faire un tour,
vous renseigner.
- J'apprécie, Shérif, merci.
- Pas de problème.
Il vous faut quelque chose
pour la route ?
Vous devriez goûter la tarte, Monsieur.
Elle est délicieuse.
Je vais m'en passer,
mais... merci.
Vous êtes sûr ?
On peut se demander
s'il s'agit simplement
de cauchemars récurrents,
ou de quelque chose de pire ?
Eh bien, je pencherais plutôt
pour des cauchemars.
Les visions de Maia n'arrivent pas
pendant son sommeil
et elle n'a jamais vu ça
quand nous étions en Espagne.
Les gros titres ne sont pas rassurants,
mais ils deviennent plus menaçants
quand votre mère
vous amène en première ligne.
Peut-être, mais on ne peut pas non plus
conclure à des visions...
- Si ?
- Mais il s'agit de camp d'internement.
Maia n'a enfreint aucune loi.
Elle <i>est</i> une 4400.
Elle n'a pas pris de promicine.
Je crains qu'il n'y ait plus
grande différence de nos jours.
Les gens ont peur.
Beaucoup voudraient voir enfermés
tous ceux ayant de la promicine en eux.
Avec la mauvaise personne
au pouvoir,
quelqu'un sachant exploiter
cette peur que tous ressentent,
subitement, cela ne semblera pas
si tiré par les cheveux.
Il y a un moyen
de tirer parti de la situation.
Si ce sont des visions,
au moins, nous sommes prévenus.
Vous voyez,
si elles étaient plus précises,
on pourrait éviter
qu'elles se réalisent.
J'essaie d'éviter à ma fille
de faire ces cauchemars,
pas à l'encourager
à obtenir plus de détails
pour que vous les analysiez.
Merci quand même
pour votre aide.
S'il vous plaît ?
Désolé, je ne vous avais pas vu.
Je peux vous aider ?
Je quittais la ville. Ce serait possible
de faire le plein ? Vos...
pompes semblent être en panne.
Ça fait longtemps
qu'il n'y a pas eu de livraison,
mais... je pense avoir
un peu d'essence derrière.
Vous me donnez une seconde ?
Que faites-vous, Monsieur ?
C'est la voiture de mon fils.
Où est-il ?
- Calmez-vous. Que voulez-vous ?
- Où est Kyle ?
- Je sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
- Ça suffit maintenant.
Lâchez cet homme tout de suite.
Shérif,
cet homme a la voiture de mon fils.
- Dis-lui !
- Je sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
Il retape ce véhicule
depuis des mois.
Et vous disiez que votre garçon
était arrivé aujourd'hui.
C'est la voiture de mon fils,
je le sais.
Je suis désolé pour vos problèmes,
Monsieur, mais vous avez tort,
et on ne peut rien faire pour vous,
alors vous devriez partir.
L'allumeur est mort.
Tu me files un coup de main ?
Vous n'auriez pas dû voir ça,
Monsieur.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Où on est ?
Tu dis avoir déchiffré ça ?
Isabelle l'a fait.
C'est une liste de noms,
mais de personnes vivantes
à notre époque.
Politiciens, leaders religieux,
scientifiques.
Selon le livre...
quand tous ces gens
auront pris de la promicine,
tout le monde en voudra.
Comme une réaction en chaîne.
Et c'est alors que...
que Dieu arrive.
Je sais que ça a l'air fou,
mais...
Mais si on se fie au sens premier,
"Dieu" pourrait signifier...
pas mal de choses.
Si ces gens voyaient un monde
guéri par la promicine,
ils ont pu l'interpréter
comme étant le Paradis.
Je sais pas. La seule façon de savoir
est de suivre le livre
et voir ce qui se passe, non ?
Nous avons laissé le gouvernement
assimiler notre mouvement
à une révolution.
Les révolutions divisent,
déstabilisent, répandent la peur.
Les religions, elles...
Les religions unifient.
Apparemment, il y a un agent du NTAC
en ville qui cherche son fils.
Mon père sait que j'ai pris une dose.
Il a dû me suivre jusqu'ici.
Il est sûrement seul.
Il cherche seulement
à me protéger.
Jordan,
ne lui faites pas de mal, OK ?
C'est mon père et...
il est le dernier sur la liste.
Le livre dit que ton père
doit prendre une dose ?
Intéressant.
Les candidatures à la fondation
pour la guérison sont anonymes.
Cela permet d'éviter le favoritisme,
et nous administrons une douzaine
de soins par jour à présent.
Le travail
que vous abattez ici est...
remarquable.
Mais je le savais déjà.
Vous allez donc cesser
de me traîner dans la boue ?
Bien au contraire.
J'ai l'intention de vous attaquer
jusqu'au jour de l'élection.
Vous considérez ça comme
un référendum sur votre personnalité.
Mais il n'en est rien.
Personnellement, je pense que vous êtes
un jeune homme exceptionnel,
mais il y a pas mal de gens
qui ont peur de ce que vous représentez.
Alors, m'opposer à vous...
c'est juste de bonne guerre.
Vous me voyez pas comme une menace,
mais vous allez le dire quand même ?
Vous...
Vous avez l'air choqué !
Écoutez...
Je lorgne une place plus importante
que simple conseiller municipal.
À votre entrée dans la course,
vous avez ameuté
les médias nationaux avec vous,
et si je n'en tirais pas parti...
je serais un bien piètre politicien,
n'est-ce pas ?
Pas un bruit.
Ouvrez la porte.
Ouvrez.
Quelle que soit votre capacité,
- ne tentez rien.
- Je ne peux pas faire de mal.
- Baissez votre arme.
- Quel est cet endroit ?
Qu'avez-vous fait à cette ville ?
C'était une ancienne
exploitation forestière,
abandonnée depuis des années,
alors on s'y est installés.
- Qui ça, "nous" ?
- Nous tous.
Chaque habitant ici
a pris une dose.
Nous voulions vivre en paix
sans crainte de se faire arrêter.
Ça ne marche pas, ici.
L'un de nous a la capacité
de brouiller les signaux électriques.
Qu'avez-vous fait à mon fils ?
Rien. Il est venu à nous.
Il va bien.
- On s'est occupés de lui.
- Alors, amenez-moi à lui.
Maintenant.
<i>Non, je ne dirais pas
que mon entretien avec M. Farrell</i>
<i>m'ait convaincu qu'un 4400</i>
<i>puisse occuper un poste officiel.</i>
Maia, que fais-tu debout ?
J'ai pas sommeil.
C'est vrai ?
Ou as-tu plutôt...
peur de ce dont
tu pourrais rêver ?
Ma puce, c'est normal d'avoir peur.
Tu sais, tu es perturbée...
et on a subi
pas mal de changements.
Pourquoi on est revenues ici ?
Pourquoi chercher
une nouvelle école ?
Et pourquoi Ben est parti ?
- Ma puce...
- Pourquoi tu m'appelles toujours
"ma puce" quand je m'énerve ?
Je suis plus une gamine.
Non, OK, Maia. Tu as raison.
Tu n'es plus une gamine...
et je comprends
que tu m'en veuilles.
On a pas mal bougé.
Mais cette ville...
aussi effrayante qu'elle puisse être,
est celle
où ta mère peut agir pour le mieux,
et c'est important.
J'ai voulu croire
que ça ne l'était pas
et j'espère que
tu le reconnaîtras un jour.
Mais, ma puce...
Maia, tu dois aller dormir.
Ça ne fait qu'empirer les choses.
Tu me donnes cette canette ?
Par ici.
Kyle, ça va ?
Je vais bien, merci...
mais je ne suis pas Kyle.
Collier, à plat ventre !
Salut, Tom.
Bienvenue dans ma ville.
Il était bon, le bacon, hein ?
OK. Donc, pour faire
des oeufs brouillés...
Tu veux casser l'oeuf ?
J'espère qu'on ne vous a pas réveillé.
On s'est dit que vous voudriez dormir
après la nuit dernière.
Comment voulez-vous vos oeufs ?
Bonjour, Tom.
Que m'avez-vous fait ?
Nous avons fait en sorte
que vous vous comportiez bien
lors de votre visite chez nous.
Le bracelet que vous portez,
c'est le mécano d'ici qui l'a créé.
Dalton.
Vous vous connaissez déjà.
C'est une sorte de traceur.
Il nous permet de savoir
où vous allez.
Et cette douleur dans votre tête,
c'est son oeuvre.
Il peut faire bien pire.
Donc, si vous...
devenez violent
- ou tentez de fuir Evanston...
- Où est Kyle ?
Kyle va bien.
Nous avons parlé.
C'est un jeune homme très brave.
Où est-il ?
Je veux le voir.
Non. Kyle et moi pensons
que vous n'êtes pas prêts.
Vous ne comprenez pas
ce que nous...
essayons d'accomplir ici.
Alors, dites-moi,
quel est cet endroit ?
C'est le prototype
d'un monde meilleur.
J'ai rassemblé ces gens.
Tous ont pris une dose
et ont quitté leurs anciennes vies.
Ils ont créé quelque chose
de meilleur à Evanston.
Baladez-vous.
Voyez par vous-même.
Maia rêve de Gabriel Hewitt ?
Dans ses cauchemars,
il est un genre de dirigeant.
Président, vice-président,
ministre, je sais pas, mais...
il semble envisager des mesures
extrêmement répressives contre les 4400.
Personne ne respecte la capacité
de ta fille plus que moi,
et je suis désolé
qu'elle ait ces visions,
mais Hewitt est candidat
aux municipales de Seattle.
Il est encore loin
d'avoir autant de pouvoir.
Non, comprends-moi bien,
je pense
que tu as été très courageux
en te présentant aux élections.
C'est exactement le genre de gestes
dont le pays a besoin, mais...
tu dois envisager le fait que tu as...
par inadvertance,
offert une tribune
à un homme très dangereux.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Abandonner ?
Pas question.
Je ne te demande rien.
Je veux juste
que tu considères tous les faits.
Ce ne sont pas des faits,
mais des rêves.
Même si ce sont des visions,
j'évite qu'elles se produisent
en restant dans la course,
en affrontant la haine
et en montrant qu'Hewitt a tort.
J'espère que c'est ce qui arrivera,
mais pour le moment...
ce n'est pas ce que voit Maia.
Nous ne sommes pas ennemis,
vous savez.
Nous pensons que
les gens doivent avoir le choix.
J'avais...
une vie minable
lorsque j'ai pris une dose.
Comme la plupart d'entre nous.
Mais à présent,
j'ai un don merveilleux,
quelque chose d'unique.
Quoi donc ?
Votre capacité ?
On pourrait m'appeler
un extracteur d'anxiété ?
Je parle aux gens.
En fait,
c'est surtout eux qui parlent,
mais quand ils ont fini,
ils se sentent mieux.
Tous leurs soucis
ont simplement disparu.
Comme une super-psy ?
Je ne donne aucun conseil,
croyez-moi,
mais...
ça marche.
J'ai dû parler
à tous les habitants.
Vous voulez essayer ?
Non, merci.
Considérez ça
comme un signe de bonne foi.
Cela vous rapprocherait
de votre fils.
En plus, ne le prenez pas mal...
mais je crois
que ça vous fera du bien.
Kyle dit que tu es essentielle
à mon oeuvre.
C'est un garçon très indulgent.
Il n'était pas là
lorsque tu as tué des 4400.
Pourquoi n'en finirais-je pas avec toi ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne suis pas dans ce livre,
mais...
quand je suis devenue adulte,
on m'a dit que ma raison d'être
était de stopper les 4400,
et c'est ce que j'ai tenté de faire.
Vous m'avez battue.
J'allais passer
le reste de ma vie en prison,
à ressasser ce que j'avais fait.
C'est alors que Kyle m'a trouvée.
Il m'a dit que j'avais un rôle à jouer,
que je pouvais
encore faire le bien.
Vous n'avez pas idée
combien je veux que ce soit vrai.
Alors, si vous aider...
me permet de donner
un sens à ma vie...
Je tente ma chance.
Si je crois les allégations de Kyle
sur le mouvement,
je dois croire celles
te concernant.
Mais au moindre pas de travers,
ton invitation est annulée,
je ne te fais pas de dessin.
Détachez-la.
Le moindre de mes faits et gestes
semble provoquer...
la perte d'un être cher.
La femme que j'aime a disparu,
mon fils est parti rejoindre Collier,
et je...
Vous avez fini ?
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
Je me sens vraiment mieux.
Ce n'est que passager.
Il faudrait
que l'on ait d'autres discussions.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Chaque fois que je parle à quelqu'un,
ceci apparaît à la fin de la discussion.
Je pense que ça représente
toutes les mauvaises choses
cachées en vous.
La peur,
l'angoisse...
Gardez-le avec vous.
Un petit souvenir
de ce que l'on réalise ici.
Kathy, vous aviez raison.
La tarte est succulente.
Oui, la tarte est très bonne,
mais l'arrière-goût
est sensationnel.
Quel arrière-goût ?
<i>Vous verrez.</i>
<i>Il commence à flipper.</i>
<i>Shannon, rassure-le.</i>
Pas de panique, Tom.
Détendez-vous.
La tarte contient
un petit quelque chose.
<i>Comment ça, "petit quelque chose" ?
Quelle chose ?</i>
<i>C'est un ingrédient particulier,</i>
<i>fourni par
l'un de nos résidents.</i>
<i>Après en avoir mangé,
nos esprits ne font plus qu'un.</i>
<i>On peut partager
nos souvenirs.</i>
<i>Un bon moyen
pour mieux se connaître.</i>
<i>C'est incroyable,
mais il faut vous détendre.</i>
C'était le dernier anniversaire
de Billy,
avant que ses parents soient tués
dans un accident d'avion.
Voici Paul et Kathy.
Ils étaient tellement mignons
étant jeunes.
Il l'a demandée en mariage
après trois semaines.
Il savait qu'elle lui était destinée.
Ils ne nous voient pas ?
Nous ne sommes pas vraiment là.
Il ne s'agit que d'un souvenir.
C'est la première fois
que je le vois.
C'est moi.
Oh, mon Dieu, c'est moi !
On a gagné le championnat
cette année-là.
Mon père avait assisté au match.
Je...
Je reste sans voix.
Encore un client satisfait.
C'était incroyable.
J'ai l'impression de tous
vous connaître, maintenant.
C'est très intense, pas vrai ?
Je suis contente qu'enfin,
vous ayez accepté l'invitation.
Oui, moi aussi.
Salut, papa.
Je suis content que tu puisses
passer du temps ici.
Ces gens ne sont pas le mal.
Ils aspirent juste à une vie meilleure,
et ils ont réussi.
Comment as-tu pu prendre une dose
et risquer ta vie ?
Ça en valait la peine, papa.
Ça m'a mené jusqu'ici.
Et bizarrement,
ça nous a rassemblés.
Nos relations
ont toujours été complexes,
mais ici, tout est simple,
c'est un bien, papa.
La vie qu'ils mènent ici
pourrait être la nôtre.
On pourrait vivre ici,
toi et moi.
C'est ce que tu veux, non ?
Qu'on soit ensemble ?
Bien entendu.
Plus que tout au monde.
Si tu veux rester,
si tu veux vivre ici,
avec moi...
tu dois prendre une dose.
Kyle, tu sais que c'est impossible.
T'as peur de mourir, papa ?
Car... je t'assure que
si tu prends la dose,
tu survivras.
Comment tu peux le savoir ?
Ici, tout le monde a une capacité,
moi y compris.
Je peux pas t'en parler maintenant,
mais...
je sais que tu vas t'en tirer.
Ça fait beaucoup d'un coup.
Tu n'es pas obligé de répondre
tout de suite, mais...
réfléchis bien.
Je ne t'ai pas dit ça
depuis longtemps,
mais je t'aime.
D'après toi, il le fera ?
Une part de lui en a envie.
Je le voyais dans ses yeux.
Il sait que cet endroit est bien,
mais toute sa vie,
il n'a fait que servir.
Le FBI, le NTAC.
Je suis pas sûr
qu'il pourra renier tout ça.
Et s'il refuse ?
Son nom figure dans le livre, non ?
On est presque sûrs
qu'il peut survivre à l'injection.
On ne peut pas
le forcer à en prendre ?
J'ai jamais forcé personne
à prendre de la promicine.
Suivre notre mouvement
est une question de choix.
Mais tes rapports
avec ton père sont...
compliqués...
Donc, si d'après toi,
il vaut mieux lui injecter la dose,
je respecterai ton choix.
En restant dans la course,
je laisse le champ libre à un monstre.
Tu n'en sais rien du tout.
- Rappelle-toi qu'on parle de rêves.
- Ce ne sont pas que des rêves.
Cette fille avait vu
que Jordan se ferait tuer.
Elle peut prédire l'avenir,
et...
Hewitt l'a dit lui-même
quand il est venu,
il se sert de moi
pour promouvoir sa carrière.
Je ne peux pas rester à rien faire.
Je dois réagir.
Si Jordan savait qu'un homme
accédait au pouvoir grâce à lui,
et qu'il pourrait devenir un...
un Hitler américain,
il ne resterait pas là
à se tourner les pouces, il...
Il agirait.
Bonjour, Tom.
Vous faites un don de promicine ?
Chaque semaine.
Chacun de nous.
J'ai horreur des aiguilles,
mais Jordan nous a tant apporté.
On a pensé qu'on pouvait
au moins lui rendre la pareille.
J'ai fabriqué cette machine.
Vous voulez voir
comment ça marche ?
Je suis content d'être venu ici.
Je sais combien tu y tiens,
et pour la première fois, je...
J'ai l'impression de comprendre
ce que Collier essaie de faire.
Mais, ce sera sans moi.
Tu t'acharnes à te considérer
comme notre adversaire,
notre ennemi.
Oublie cette idée !
- Ce serait si simple.
- C'est pas le problème, Kyle.
Cette ville ressemble à une utopie,
mais elle est là pour répandre
la promicine dans les rues,
et quoi qu'il arrive,
la moitié de ceux
qui prendront la dose, mourront.
- Et je peux pas le supporter.
- Il le faut.
On doit tous l'admettre, papa.
Oublie le 50-50, OK ?
Si le mouvement échoue,
c'est la fin assurée.
J'y crois pas.
Je ne peux pas.
Je comprends, tu dois suivre
ce en quoi tu crois.
- Tout comme moi.
- Non, attends, Kyle.
Toi seul pourrais
me donner l'envie de le faire.
Je t'aime.
Poussez-vous.
Je m'en vais.
Désolé que vous ayez décliné
notre invitation, Tom.
Désolé que votre incrédulité
vous coûte votre fils.
Je pars.
Frappez-moi s'il le faut,
mais je pars d'ici.
Vous savez que c'est impossible.
Je vous l'ai dit.
Je ne prendrai pas la dose !
Il y a plus que la politique,
pas vrai ?
Qu'est-ce que vous fichez ici ?
Tout ce que vous m'avez raconté
à mon bureau n'était que mensonge.
C'est une propriété privée.
Je pourrais vous faire arrêter
pour violation de propriété.
En vérité, vous nous détestez.
Vous détestez tous les 4400.
Et même si c'est le cas ?
Qu'est-ce que ça change ?
Pour la seconde fois,
pourquoi traînez-vous
autour de mon garage ?
Que faites-vous ici ?
Je voulais vous voir
sans caméras
quand vous mettez de côté
votre apparence publique,
et vous regarder dans les yeux.
J'ai des raisons de croire
que vous êtes capable d'atrocités
et que vous êtes
l'incarnation du mal.
Même si vous voyiez le mal...
Et après ?
Franchement,
je ne saurais pas quoi faire.
Mais à vrai dire,
je ne vois rien.
Vous êtes peut-être
empli de haine et de peur
mais vous n'êtes qu'un homme.
Pour l'instant.
Vous ne devez pas encore le savoir.
Vous feriez un piètre dirigeant.
Je ne vous laisserai pas
le devenir.
Tu es négatif à la promicine.
Je suis désolée pour Kyle, Tom.
On doit appeler Meghan,
lancer un avis de recherche.
Contre Jordan Collier,
ses adeptes...
et mon fils.
Désolé, mais je n'ai pas pu le forcer,
Jordan.
C'était ton choix.
Le sédatif qu'on lui a injecté
nous a laissé assez de temps
pour partir d'Evanston.
Mais il est parti.
J'ai perdu mon père.
<i>On</i> a perdu mon père.
Son nom est dans le livre.
S'il ne prend pas la dose,
on va échouer.
Alors, continue à croire
qu'il la prendra.
Mais, ça n'arrivera pas
sous la contrainte.
Un de ces jours, Kyle,
je sais que ton père nous rejoindra.
On a perdu Evanston
par ma faute.
Le Paradis nous a échappé.
C'est pas grave.
Evanston n'était pas censée être
notre destination définitive.
C'était seulement...
un avant-goût du Paradis.
Et maintenant, on fait quoi ?
Il y a tous ces gens, là.
Qu'allez-vous faire pour eux ?
Aucun de vous...
ne doit perdre espoir.
Nous allons continuer.
Un foyer attend chacun de nous.
Nous nous rendons à Seattle.

<i>v1.01</i>
<i>SeriesSub</i> presents...
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...
You're
the alternative we need
to collier and his
promicin-pushing radicals.
Does that mean you'll run
for city council?
It means I'm going to run
and I'm going to win.
Promicin...
is out there.
People are gaining abilities,
and...
nothing can be done about that.
- Who's cassie?
- I'm not what you'd call real.
I'm Kyle's ability.
<i>Everything in that book
is going to come true.
Collier will lead the human race
to salvation.
You will help him.
Isabelle Tyler...
<i>I've done bad things,
and I'm supposed to do more.
I was sent
to help you get away.
This is all happening
for a reason.
Do you believe that
Jordan Collier is a Messiah,
and promicin's
gonna save the world?
Kyle, listen to me,
if you're involved in something...
The lab report you asked for,
samples came back positive for promicin.
Hey, dad, what's up?
<i>Where are you, Kyle?
Is something wrong?
I need to talk to you, buddy.
It's important,
but we have to do it in person.
Can you come home now?
Sure, yeah. I can be home in, like,
20 minutes or something.
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- 20 minutes. I'll be here.
You can't go
back there, Kyle.
He knows.
Knows what?
What do you think?
Your father knows
you took the promicin shot.
What's he going to do?
Is he going to tell NTAC?
If I can't go home, what am I supposed
to do? Where do I live?
You can move on now.
Move where?
You're heading north.
Take highway 99
until it crosses
with rural route 57.
Follow that, and you'll find
an old logging pass.
When it ends, get out
and start walking due west.
What am I looking for?
Go there.
Enjoy the surprise.
I heard talking.
Is everything okay?
You have to get ready, okay?
We're leaving.
Don't let them take me!
Oh, sweetie.
It's okay.
Sweetheart, it's okay.
Nobody's taking you anywhere.
You just had a nightmare.
It's like a prison.
All the people with abilities
are there.
They make us
line up,
then they take us away,
someplace bad.
What kind of place?
You've had
this dream before.
That was the second time.
I thought
it was going to go away,
but it didn't.
It's okay, sweetie.
Come here.
It's okay, baby.
What are we even supposed to be
looking for?
We're in the middle
of nowhere.
Cassie said to come here.
That means there's something here.
That cell tower services
the entire area.
And you're positive, that's the final
signal from my son's phone?
All right.
all right, thanks.
God, just for once,
I'd like to beat you in here.
Listen, I have to leave for a while.
Kyle's in trouble.
Is he?
What's wrong?
I can't get into it,
but I have to find him,
and I need you to cover for me.
I just got off the phone
with Kyle's wireless carrier.
The last signal from his cell phone
came from about four hours away,
so it could be a while.
Maybe even a day or two.
Tell me what's wrong.
I'd like to help.
The best help you could give me
is to cover my back.
Tell anyone who asks I'm in the field
on one of our cases, all right?
I'll call you
when I find him.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
You trapped me.
You led me right to him.
How did you find this place?
I took the shot.
I've been having these visions.
they led me to you.
They told me
I have to bring you something.
It's just a book, man.
It's important.
It's about you.
You have to read it.
There was this...
religious movement
about 90 years ago.
White light,
they called it a cult.
This book was their prophecy.
It's all about promicin,
the movement.
It's the reason
I'm supposed to find you.
And her?
Were you supposed to lead
Isabelle Tyler to me as well?
I was guided to her
the same way I was guided to you.
She's going to help us
with the movement, Jordan.
I'm not a threat to you.
I don't have
my abilities anymore.
What could you possibly do
for me?
I don't know.
That's you.
I'm telling you,
it's all about you.
Bring them.
<i>Mr. Farrell has been handed
this remarkable ability, but...
<i>he himself...
<i>is simply not that
distinguished of a young man.
<i>Now, even if he was
the second coming of robert kennedy,
<i>I would still say that a 4400
<i>has no business
running for public office.
Today's clippings.
Do I wanna read
today's clippings?
Everyone respects
your healing work,
but... they're calling you out
on your age,
your inexperience,
your lack of education,
- your connections with Jordan Collier.
- I get it, I get it.
It's just, do I really have to study
my own shortcomings?
That's what I want to know.
Your campaign manager
thinks you do.
She got you a meeting
with Gabriel Hewitt later today,
and you're gonna have to be able
to refute his...
talking points.
One by one.
I have to have a sit-down with the man
that's been badmouthing me
to anybody that'll put
a camera in his face?
I think the idea
is to win him over.
Tell him
about the foundation.
Convince him you are not
some pawn of Jordan Collier.
I admire you, Kyle.
Given your background,
it must have been difficult
to take the promicin shot.
But I've read your book.
It's wrong.
- I'm no Messiah.
- I know how it sounds.
It was hard for me to believe, too.
I'm nobody's religious nut,
but these visions I have
are never wrong, not once,
and if they say that book is important,
I have to believe it.
I have to believe
what's in there.
Promicin
isn't just here
to improve
the world, Jordan.
It's here to bring
heaven to earth.
I don't know
exactly what that means, but...
You're supposed to make it happen,
and I'm supposed to help you.
It's like it says in the book.
You are going to lead us all...
to God.
Untie him.
We'll continue this
somewhere more comfortable.
What about me?
I'll deal with you soon enough.
Goodness me,
a customer I don't recognize.
Will wonders ever cease?
I guess you don't get many visitors.
This town isn't even on my map.
That highway two
went in a few years back.
Since then, we've been
a little short on visitors,
but it's a treat to have one
as handsome as you.
Kathy, would you stop flirting
with the poor man,
see if he wants
some lunch?
I'm good.
Thanks.
You don't come all this way
to skip my famous apple pie.
Tell the man, will you, Shannon?
Kathy makes a mean apple pie.
It's the house specialty.
I'm sure she does.
I wish I had time. Actually,
I was hoping to find the sheriff.
There was a note on the door.
He should just move
his office in here.
Thanks.
My son's driving a green Saturn.
Well, there's not much reason
to come out here,
but if I do see it,
I'll definitely give you a call.
Now, if your boy
did pass through here,
I'm sure he's moved on by now.
But you're welcome
to have a wander, ask around.
- I appreciate that, sheriff, thanks.
- Not a problem.
Is there anything we can get you
for the road?
You should try
the pie, Mister.
It's really good.
I'll pass, but thanks.
You sure?
So I guess the question is
are we just talking about
a kid's recurring nightmare,
or is it something worse?
Well, obviously,
I'm pulling for nightmares.
Maia's visions don't usually
happen while she's sleeping,
and she wasn't seeing this
while we were in Spain.
The headlines aren't exactly reassuring
and they're a lot more immediate
when your mom brings you back
to the front lines.
Maybe so, but we can't really
rule out visions either,
- can we?
- But we're talking about prison camps.
Maia hasn't broken any laws.
She is a 4400.
She didn't take promicin.
I'm afraid that distinction
doesn't mean much these days.
People are scared.
A lot of them want to lock up
every p-positive out there.
The wrong leader comes to power,
someone who exploits all that fear
everybody's feeling,
and suddenly this doesn't seem
so farfetched.
There's a more productive way
to look at this.
I mean, if they are visions,
at least we've got some warning.
You know,
if we had more specifics,
maybe we can make sure
they don't come true.
I'm trying to stop my daughter
from having these nightmares,
not encourage her
to have more specific ones
so that you can
analyze them.
Thanks for your help, though.
Excuse me?
Sorry, I didn't
see you there.
Can I get you something?
Yeah, look, I'm on my way out of town.
Any chance I can fill up? Your...
pumps don't seem to be working.
I haven't had a gas truck around
in a while,
but I think I got
a spare gas can in the back.
Just give me a sec?
What are you doing, Mister?
- That's my son's car. Where is he?
- Calm Down.
- What you're talking about ?
- Where's kyle?
- What you're talking about, man?
- Now, you hold it right there.
Take your hands
off that man right now.
Sheriff, this man
has my son's car.
- Tell him!
- Don't know what you're talking about!
He's been messing
with this vehicle for months.
You said yourself your boy
just drove through here today.
That's my son's car,
I know it is.
I am sorry for your troubles, Mister,
but you're wrong,
and I don't think we can help you here,
so maybe it's time you just moved on.
Starter's on the fritz.
Give me a hand here?
You shouldn't have seen that,
Mister.
Who are you people?
What is this place?
You say you deciphered this?
Isabelle did.
It's a list
of names,
but it's people
who are alive today.
Politicians, religious leaders,
scientists.
The book says that...
once these people
all take promicin,
everyone will.
It's like a domino effect.
And that's when...
when God comes.
I know it sounds
crazy, but...
Only if you take the book
literally.
"God" could mean...
any number of things.
If these people saw a world
healed by promicin,
they could have interpreted that
as heaven.
I don't know. The only way
we'll know is if we just follow the book
and see what happens, right?
We've allowed the government
to characterize the movement
as a revolution.
Revolutions divide,
destabilize, spread fear.
Religions...
Religions unite.
Apparently there's an NTAC agent in town
looking for his son.
My dad knows I took the shot.
He must have tracked me here.
He would have come on his own.
He's just looking to protect me,
that's it.
Jordan,
be careful with him, okay?
He's my father, and...
He's the last name on the list.
The book says your father
has to take the shot?
Interesting.
So, the application process
for the healing foundation is blind.
Helps to avoid favoritism,
and we average about a dozen
treatments a day now.
Well, the work you do here is...
remarkable.
But then I already knew that.
Well, does that mean
you're going to stop slinging mud at me?
Quite the contrary.
I intend on attacking you
right up until the day of the election.
You seem to be taking this as if it's
a referendum on your character.
I assure you
that it isn't.
Personally, I think
you're an exceptional young man,
but there are a lot of people out there
that are afraid of what you represent,
so going after you...
that's just good politics.
So you don't think I'm a threat,
but you're gonna say that I am anyway?
You...
You look so shocked.
Look...
I have my eyes on something greater
than just city council.
When you declared for the race,
you brought the national
media spotlight with you,
and if I didn't
take advantage of that, well...
I wouldn't be much
of a politician, now, would I?
Don't make a sound.
Now open the door.
Open it up.
Whatever you can do,
whatever your ability is,
- don't try to use it.
- I can't hurt anybody. Please...
put the gun down now.
What is this place?
What did you people do
to this town?
It was an old timber mill town.
It was abandoned years ago,
so we came and made it our own.
- Who's we?
- All of us.
Everyone who lives here
has taken the shot.
We just wanted a place
where we could live peacefully
without fear of being arrested.
That won't work here.
We have someone who can disrupt
electrical signals.
What did you do to my son?
Nothing. He came to us.
He's safe.
- He's being taken care of.
- Then take me to him.
Now.
No, I wouldn't say that
my meeting with Mr. Farrell did...
anything to convince me
that a 4400
should hold public office.
Maia, what are you doing up?
I'm not tired.
Is that true,
or are you just...
worried about what
you might dream?
Sweetie, it's okay to be scared.
You know, you're upset,
we've...
and we've been through
a lot of changes.
Why are we back here?
Why do I have to find
a new school?
And why is Ben gone?
And why do you always
call me sweetie when I get upset?
I'm not a little kid anymore.
No, okay, Maia, you're right.
You're not a little kid,
and I understand
if you're mad at me.
I mean, we've
moved around a lot.
But this city...
as scary as it can be,
is the one place
where your mom can do the most good,
and that's important.
I tried to pretend
that it wasn't,
and I hope
you'll appreciate that one day.
But, sweetie...
Maia,
you can't stay up forever.
It'll only make you feel worse.
Do you think I could have that can?
Here.
Kyle, you all right?
I'm fine, thanks...
but I'm not Kyle.
Collier, get down
on the ground!
Hello, tom.
Welcome to my town.
That bacon smells good, huh?
Okay, so to make
scrambled eggs...
Do you want to crack the egg?
Oh, I hope we didn't wake you.
We figured you would want
to sleep after last night.
How do you like your eggs?
Morning, Tom.
What did you do to me?
Well,
we've taken steps to ensure
that you behave yourself
while you're our guest.
That bracelet you're wearing,
our town mechanic created that.
Dalton. I believe you met him.
It's quite a device.
It allows us to track you
wherever you go.
And that...
that pain in your head,
he did that.
He's capable of worse.
So, if you...
become violent while you're here,
or make any attempt
- to leave Evanston...
- Where's Kyle?
Kyle is fine.
We've been talking.
He's a very brave young man.
Where is he?
I want to see him.
Not yet. Kyle and I agree,
you're not ready.
You don't understand
what we're...
trying to accomplish here.
All right, then tell me,
what is this place?
It's a model for a better world.
I gathered these people.
They all took the shot
and left their old lives behind.
They've created something better
here in Evanston.
Have a walk around.
See for yourself.
Maia's dreaming
about Gabriel Hewitt?
In her nightmares,
he's some kind of leader.
President, vice president,
cabinet member,
I don't know,
but he seems to be overseeing
some extremely repressive
measures against the 4400.
Nobody respects
your daughter's ability
more than I do, and I'm sorry
that she's seeing these things,
but Hewitt,
he's on the seattle city council.
That's a long way away
from pulling
these kinds of strings.
No, please understand,
I think you've taken
a very brave step
by declaring for public office.
It's exactly the kind of gesture
this country needs, but...
I mean, you have to consider
that you may...
inadvertently
be giving a platform
to a very dangerous man.
What are you asking me to do?
Drop out?
Because that's not going to happen.
I'm not asking you
to do anything.
I just want you
to have the facts.
But these aren't facts,
they're dreams.
Even if they are visions,
I stop them from happening
by staying in the race,
by taking a stand against hatred
and proving Hewitt wrong.
I hope that's what happens,
but right now...
That's not what Maia's seeing.
We're not the enemy, you know.
We just think
people deserve a choice.
I was in a...
bad place
when I took the shot.
Most of us were.
But now I can do
something wonderful,
something no one else can.
What is it?
Your ability?
I guess you could call me
an anxiety extractor?
I talk to people.
Actually, they do
most of the talking,
but when we're done,
they feel better.
All their worry's just gone.
What's that,
like a souped-up shrink?
I don't have any advice,
believe me,
but...
it works.
I talked to just about
everybody in town.
Would you want to try it?
I don't think so.
Think of it
as a good faith gesture.
You'd be one step closer
to seeing your son.
Plus, no offense...
But I think you could use it.
Kyle says you're essential
to what I'm doing.
He's a very forgiving young man.
He wasn't there
when you killed 4400s.
Why shouldn't I be rid of you
forever?
I don't know.
I'm not in that book,
but...
when I first got older,
I was told I existed
to stop the 4400,
and that's what I tried to do.
You beat me.
I thought I'd spend the rest
of my life in prison,
thinking about what I'd done,
and then Kyle found me.
He told me I have a purpose.
He told me I could
still be good.
You have no idea
how much I want that
to be true.
So if helping you is the way
to make my life
mean something,
I want to try.
If I accept what Kyle says
about our movement,
I have to accept
what he says about you,
but the first moment
you make me nervous,
your invitation is rescinded,
and you can guess
what that means.
Cut her down.
Every move I make,
it seems like there's some
kind of loss
that comes with it,
and the woman I love is gone,
I'm losing my son
to Collier, and I...
Are you done?
How do you feel?
Wow, I actually feel better.
It's not permanent.
We would need to have
follow-up talks.
It...
What is this?
Whenever I talk to someone,
at the end,
there's one of these.
I think it represents
all of the bad stuff
inside of you.
The fear,
anxiety...
You should keep it.
A little reminder
of what we do here.
Kathy, you weren't lying.
This pie is delicious.
Yeah, the pie's pretty good,
but the aftertaste
is a killer.
Aftertaste?
What aftertaste?
<i>You'll see.</i>
<i>He's getting scared.</i>
<i>Shannon, tell him it's okay.</i>
It's all right, Tom.
Just relax.
The pie had
a little something in it.
<i>Something, what do you mean?
What something?</i>
<i>It's a special ingredient,</i>
<i>courtesy of
one of our residents.</i>
<i>After we take it,
we share one mind.</i>
<i>We can see
each other's memories.</i>
<i>It's how we know
each other better.</i>
<i>It's amazing,
if you just relax.</i>
This was Billy's last birthday,
before his parents were killed
in a plane crash.
That's Paul and Kathy.
They were so cute
when they were young.
He popped the question
after three weeks.
He said he just knew.
They can't see us?
We're not even really here.
It's just a memory.
I've never seen this before.
This is me.
Oh, my god, that's me.
We won the league
championship that year.
My father actually
came to the game.
I, uh...
I don't know what to say.
Another satisfied customer.
That was amazing.
You know, I feel like
I know you all now.
It's pretty intense, isn't it?
I'm just glad you finally
accepted the invitation.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, dad.
Glad you got to spend
some time in this place.
These people,
they're not evil.
They're just looking to make
a better life for themselves,
and they did.
How could you take the shot?
How could you
risk your life like that?
It was worth it, dad.
It brought me here.
In a weird way,
it brought us together.
I know our relationship
has always been complicated,
but this place is simple.
It's good, dad.
And the life they're living here,
dad, that could be our life.
We could live here,
you and me.
Isn't that what you want?
For us to be together?
Of course.
More than anything.
If you want to stay here,
if you want to
live here with me...
You have to take the shot.
Kyle, you know I can't do that.
Are you afraid of dying, dad?
Because I promise you,
if you take the shot,
you will live.
How could you know that?
Everybody here has
an ability. So do I.
I can't talk to you
about it right now,
but I know that you'll be okay.
That's a lot to take in right now.
You don't have to give me
an answer right away. Just...
sleep on it.
I know I haven't
said this to you in a long time,
but I love you.
Do you think he'll do it?
Part of him wants to.
I could see it in his eyes.
He knows this place is good,
but his whole life
has just been about duty.
The FBI, NTAC.
I'm not sure he'll be able to
just turn his back on all that.
And if he says no?
His name's in the book?
That's pretty much a guarantee
that he can survive the shot.
Can we just make him take it?
I've never forced anyone
to take promicin.
The movement's
always been about choice.
But your relationship
with your father, it's...
intricate...
So if you think it best
to give him the shot,
I'll respect your decision.
So if I stay in the race,
I'm creating a monster.
You don't know that for sure.
Remember, we're
talking about dreams.
No, these aren't just dreams.
This girl predicted
that Jordan would be shot.
She can tell the future,
and Hewitt said it himself
when he was here.
He's using me to get
attention for his career.
I can't just sit on this.
I have to do something.
If Jordan found out
that some guy
was rising
to power on his back,
and he could become
some kind of...
home-grown Hitler,
he wouldn't just sit around
wringing his hands. He...
He'd act.
Good morning, Tom.
You're donating promicin?
Every week.
We all do.
I hate needles,
but Jordan's given us all
so much.
We figure the least we can do
is give something back.
I rigged up this machine here.
You want to see how it works?
I'm glad I saw this place.
I know how much it means to you,
and for the first time, I...
I feel like maybe I understand
what Collier's trying to do.
But I can't be a part of it.
You're just holding onto
this idea of yourself
as our opponent, our enemy.
You can just let go of that.
- It'd be so easy.
- It's not about that, Kyle.
This town,
it's like a little utopia,
but it exists to send promicin out
into the streets,
and no matter
how you look at it,
half the people who take
that shot are going to die,
- and I can't live with that.
- You have to.
We all have to, dad.
Forget 50-50, okay?
If the movement
doesn't succeed,
nobody has any chance.
I don't believe that.
I can't.
I get it. You have
to follow what you believe,
and so do I.
No, wait, Kyle.
You are the only thing
that could tempt me to do this.
I love you.
Get out of my way.
I'm leaving.
I'm sorry you've declined
our invitation, Tom.
I'm sorry your lack of faith
will cost you your son.
I'm walking away.
Go ahead and give me
a stroke if you have to,
but I'm walking out
of this town.
You know
I can't let you do that.
I told you.
I'm not taking the shot!
It's not just
about the politics, is it?
What the hell
are you doing here?
Everything that you said to me
in my office that day was a lie.
This is private property.
You know that I could
have you arrested for trespassing.
The truth is you hate us all.
You hate all the 4400.
So what if I do?
I mean, what difference
does it make?
Now, I'll ask you again,
why are you hanging around
outside my garage?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you
without the cameras
when you put your public
face up for the night,
have a look at your eyes.
I have reason to believe
that you're capable
of terrible things,
and that you have an evil
living inside of you.
What if you did see evil?
Then what?
Honestly, I don't know
what I would do,
but the truth is,
I can't see anything.
You may be full of fear
and hatred,
but you're just a man.
For now.
Listen, you might not
know it yet.
You wouldn't make
a very good leader.
I'm not going to let you
become one.
But your promicin test
came back negative.
I'm so sorry about Kyle, Tom.
We need to call Meghan,
issue a new APB.
Jordan Collier,
his followers...
And my son.
I couldn't force him to take it,
Jordan. I'm sorry.
Well, I left
the choice up to you.
Anyway,
the sedative we gave him
gave us enough time
to get out of Evanston.
But he's gone. I lost my dad.
We lost my dad.
His name is in the book.
If he doesn't take the shot,
we don't succeed.
Then you need to have faith
he will.
But it won't happen
because we forced it on him.
One day, Kyle,
I believe
your father will come to us.
We lost Evanston
because of me.
I cost us paradise.
It's all right.
Evanston was never meant
as a permanent settlement.
It was only a...
a dress rehearsal for paradise.
So what do we do now?
You've got all these
people here.
What are you
going to do with them?
None of you
should lose hope.
There is a next step.
There is a home waiting
for each and every one of you.
We're going to Seattle.

<i>à Collier et son groupe de radicaux
prônant la promicine.</i>
Cela veut-il dire
que vous êtes candidat ?
Je suis candidat
et je vais gagner.
J'ai l'intention de vous attaquer
jusqu'au jour de l'élection.
Il y a pas mal de gens qui ont peur
de ce que vous représentez.
<i>Je vise une place plus importante
que simple conseiller municipal.</i>
<i>- Vous détestez les 4400.
- Et si c'est le cas ?</i>
<i>J'ai des raisons de croire
que vous êtes capable d'atrocités</i>
et que vous êtes
l'incarnation du mal.
Je suis censée éliminer les 4400.
La catastrophe que les 4400
devraient prévenir...
- C'est qu'un mensonge.
- C'est ce que tu dis.
<i>Tout ce qui figure dans ce livre
va se réaliser.</i>
Collier conduira le genre humain
à la rédemption.
Tu l'y aideras.
<i>J'ai trouvé notre homme.</i>
<i>Son nom est Robert Shaftoe.</i>
<i>Ancien Marine.</i>
<i>Tireur d'élite.</i>
<i>Il a déjà travaillé pour notre...</i>
<i>organisation, à Kansas City.</i>
<i>Si vous voulez tuer quelqu'un,</i>
<i>le voir définitivement mort,</i>
<i>alors, Shaftoe est votre homme.</i>
<i>Ça me va.</i>
<i>Faites-le venir.</i>
<i>Vous êtes bien sûr
de vouloir faire ça ?</i>
<i>Parce que si Shaftoe
passe cette porte,</i>
<i>plus de retour en arrière.</i>
<i>La cible...</i>
<i>est un homme mort.</i>
- <i>Définitivement.</i>
- Mon Dieu !
Les acteurs, le dialogue,
c'est épouvantable.
- Marco, pourquoi on regarde ça ?
- Chut...
Le meilleur moment arrive.
<i>Cette mission est dangereuse.</i>
<i>C'est peut-être la mission
la plus dangereuse</i>
<i>qu'on vous ait assignée.</i>
<i>Mais si vous réussissez,</i>
<i>vous ne le regretterez pas.</i>
<i>Et la récompense ?</i>
<i>Elle sera à la hauteur...
du danger.</i>
<i>Le danger est mon quotidien.</i>
<i>C'est comme s'il était déjà mort.</i>
<i>Définitivement...</i>
<i>mort.</i>
C'est notre homme.
Voici Curtis Peck.
C'est un 4400 d'origine.
Correction...
- Il est notre 4400 d'origine préféré.
- Avant de disparaître,
Curtis écrivait, dirigeait,
et jouait dans des films d'horreur.
Des films sans budget.
Il tournait tout dans sa maison.
Les acteurs ?
En général,
ses amis et sa famille.
Vraiment ?
Je n'aurais jamais deviné.
Depuis son retour,
Curtis fait toujours des films,
mais d'un autre genre.
Chaque film concerne
une affaire non résolue.
Il en a fait un sur la disparition
de Jimmy Hoffa,
un drame en costumes
dans son jardin
sur les colonies disparues
de Roanoke.
Vous venez de voir celui
sur l'assassinat de JFK.
Super, Marco.
Content de voir qu'il a un passe-temps.
Ce n'est pas qu'un passe-temps.
Certains pensent que ces films
sont en fait
- le fruit de ses capacités de 4400.
- Arrêtez, les gars...
vous n'allez pas nous dire
que ce film...
montre ce qui est réellement arrivé
au président Kennedy ?
On ne peut pas en être sûrs,
mais, il existe bien un ex-Marine
du nom de Robert Shaftoe,
et il était bien à Dallas
le 22 novembre 1963.
On ne peut pas prouver
que Curtis a raison,
mais avouez tout de même
que ses théories
sont fascinantes.
Il y a beaucoup d'adeptes
de conspirations,
et il s'adresse sans aucun doute
à ce public,
mais, Marco,
on a pas mal de boulot,
et on n'a pas vraiment le temps
de s'attarder sur
ce qui <i>pourrait</i> être
une aptitude de 4400.
Et je ne supporterai pas
un autre de ces films.
On ne vous a pas fait venir
pour parler de ses capacités.
Curtis a disparu.
Personne ne sait où il est.
Depuis 10 jours,
il n'écrit plus rien sur son mySpace.
En voyant ça,
on a essayé de le contacter.
Il ne décroche pas son téléphone,
il ne répond pas aux mails.
Je sais, je sais,
rien de grave, d'accord ?
Rien d'inquiétant, mais il ne s'est pas
présenté à son dernier contrôle au NTAC.
Curtis Peck a disparu de la carte.
Quelqu'un devrait s'en occuper.
- Quel est cet endroit ?
- Je sais pas,
Cassie a juste dit
qu'on devait venir ici.
Sûrement un ancien
abri antiaérien.
On devrait être en sécurité ici.
Personne n'est venu depuis des années.
Je ne vois pas pourquoi
on est venus à Seattle.
On a conduit une centaine de personnes
dans une ville
où tout le monde nous recherche.
Personne ne sait où aller,
ni quoi faire.
Et vous pensez
que c'est la solution ?
- Cet endroit est en ruines.
- Nous le remettrons en état.
Merci de nous avoir conduits ici.
Tes capacités sont vraiment
extraordinaires.
Que tout le monde s'installe.
C'est l'endroit idéal...
pour un nouveau départ.
Combien tu veux parier
qu'on va réveiller un gars
avec une gueule de bois
phénoménale ?
Curtis !
Curtis Peck !
Quelqu'un est entré
par effraction ?
Peut-être, où alors il est
aussi nul pour le ménage
que pour faire des films.
On dirait que rien ne manque.
Tout son matériel vidéo est là.
Vous cherchez Curtis ?
Oui, en effet.
Nous sommes du NTAC.
- Vous le connaissez ?
- Bien sûr.
Je suis Neal Handler.
J'habite juste derrière.
Je suis le voisin de Curtis.
Et... son collaborateur.
Je suis fier de dire que
j'ai joué dans plus de films
que quiconque.
- Oui, on a... on a vu votre oeuvre.
- Merci.
Je n'ai pas vu Curtis
depuis plusieurs jours. Il va bien ?
En fait,
c'est ce qu'on cherche à savoir.
Vous savez
si Curtis avait des ennemis,
ou si quelqu'un aurait des raisons
de pénétrer chez lui ?
Des ennemis ?
Au choix...
La CIA, la mafia...
les francs-maçons.
Curtis a dénoncé
beaucoup de gens.
Donc, vous...
pensez que ses films sont exacts ?
Bien entendu !
C'est pour cela
qu'ils l'ont ramené...
dans une boule de lumière.
Pour montrer la vérité
à ce monde réticent.
Mais, pour être franc...
si quelqu'un a fouillé
cet endroit,
je peux vous assurer
qu'il n'a pas trouvé ce qu'il cherchait.
Curtis a...
une cachette secrète.
Il range son journal dedans.
Toutes les notes qu'il prend.
Vous pouvez nous la montrer ?
On cherche juste à aider votre ami,
c'est tout.
Et on aime vraiment
ses films, aussi.
On vient juste de voir
celui sur JFK,
et il était... très bien.
Vous étiez vraiment bon.
C'est là.
Tenez.
Curtis trouvait son inspiration
là-dedans.
<i>Si vous regardez ceci,
c'est que j'ai des problèmes.</i>
<i>De graves problèmes.</i>
<i>Ne croyez pas ce que vous pourriez
entendre : accident de voiture, suicide.</i>
<i>Si j'ai disparu,
c'est qu'ils sont venus me chercher.</i>
<i>Je réfléchis à une idée
de nouveau film.</i>
<i>C'est énorme.
C'est tellement énorme</i>
<i>que tout changera
si j'arriver à le réaliser</i>
<i>et c'est ce qu'ils craignent.</i>
<i>Ce sont eux.
Ils arrivent.</i>
<i>Vous devez savoir que
Jordan Collier...</i>
<i>Les 4400... Ce ne sont pas eux
qu'il faut craindre.</i>
<i>Il y a quelque chose d'autre,
de bien pire...</i>
<i>ils sont bien pires,
et ils viennent me chercher.</i>

<i>... c'est comme s'il était mort.</i>
<i>Définitivement... mort.</i>
Selon Curtis, Jimmy Hoffa a été
enterré dans les Everglades en Floride.
Si tu y crois,
alors tu devrais lire ça.
Recherche d'antécédents sur Curtis.
Il doit de l'argent
à des banques et au fisc.
Il a 3 ans de retard
sur une pension alimentaire.
J'ai parlé à son ex-femme.
Elle a déménagé dans le Wisconsin
pour s'éloigner de lui.
Elle n'a pas eu de nouvelles
depuis 9 mois.
Écoute, si quelqu'un devait
s'en prendre à ce type, ça serait...
ses créditeurs, ou...
des critiques de ciné.
Mais ses dettes se chiffrent
avec 6 zéros.
Il n'aurait pas pu
juste fuir la ville ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il avait l'air vraiment effrayé
à la fin de la vidéo
et il est trop mauvais acteur
pour simuler ça.
En plus...
si ces films sont le résultat
de ses capacités de 4400,
n'es-tu pas un peu curieux
de découvrir ce qui peut
dépasser le pouvoir
de Jordan Collier ?
Tant qu'on n’a pas de preuves
que ce type est réglo,
je veux juste m'assurer
qu'il va bien.
Regarde les crédits.
Depuis que Curtis est revenu,
ses films ont été produits
par un certain Stuart Henley.
Je me suis renseignée.
Avocat à la retraite.
Il n'habite pas loin.
Peut-être que <i>lui</i> sait quelque chose
sur le dernier film de Curtis ?
Ça vaut le coup d'essayer.
Et j'aimerais pouvoir regarder
dans les yeux l'homme qui...
est prêt à financer
"J'ai démembré Jimmy Hoffa".
<i>Non, je ne pense pas
que l'annonce</i>
<i>de ma candidature
au poste de Maire</i>
<i>réduira l'attention que je porte</i>
<i>à la campagne de Shawn Farrell.</i>
<i>Je pense plutôt que la Mairie</i>
<i>me permettrait de m'opposer
plus facilement...</i>
M. Farrell ?
- Un messager vient de déposer ceci.
- Merci.
Puisqu'on va travailler ensemble,
vous pouvez m'appeler Shawn.
<i>Salut, Shawn...
c'est Kyle.</i>
Où es-tu ?
Je m'inquiétais.
Je vais bien, mon pote.
Même mieux que ça, en fait.
Je m'étais pas senti aussi bien
depuis longtemps.
Tu as reçu le colis ?
C'est toi qui l'as envoyé ?
<i>Nous l'avons envoyé.</i>
Écoute, c'est très important.
Il faut que tu lises tout
avant le rendez-vous.
Quel rendez-vous, Kyle ?
<i>Jordan est dans le coin.
Il veut te rencontrer.</i>
Tu es avec Jordan ?
Pourquoi il veut me voir ?
C'est important, OK ?
Rappelle-moi sur ce nº
quand tu auras fini le livre.
On enverra quelqu'un te chercher.
M. Henley ?
J'entends la radio à l'intérieur
et je jure avoir entendu
quelqu'un bouger.
M. Henley !
Il est là !
Stuart Henley,
attendez !
Restez là !
Je vous jure,
je dirai rien à personne !
- Ne me tuez pas !
- Calmez-vous.
- Personne ne va vous tuer.
- Nous sommes du NTAC.
Nous recherchons Curtis Peck.
Vous le trouverez pas.
Ils l'ont emmené.
Qui ?
Pourquoi vous échappiez-vous ?
De quoi avez-vous si peur ?
Ceux du film de Curtis...
Les Marqués.
C'est le nom de son film ?
Vous pouvez nous en parler ?
Il y a un mois,
il est venu me voir,
il disait avoir une idée
de nouveau film,
qui s'appellerait "Les Marqués".
Selon lui, ce serait
son plus grand film.
J'étais intrigué,
alors, je lui ai demandé de faire
une bande-annonce.
J'aime bien voir de quoi parle un film
avant de faire un chèque.
Il me l'a donnée
il y a environ 2 semaines.
Vous l'avez toujours ?
Je vous la donnerai avec joie,
parce que...
si ce que dit Curtis est vrai,
alors, je jure devant Dieu que
j'aurais préféré ne jamais la regarder.
<i>Voici notre monde.</i>
<i>Vous le reconnaissez ?</i>
<i>Sans doute,</i>
<i>ou peut-être que non.</i>
<i>Nous savons tous qu'il a changé à jamais
lorsque les 4400 sont revenus.</i>
<i>Leur mission ?</i>
<i>Ils ont été envoyés du futur</i>
<i>pour éviter une catastrophe.</i>
<i>Mais tous, dans le futur,</i>
<i>ne partagent pas cette idée.</i>
<i>Une partie de l'élite</i>
<i>souhaite que le futur
ne soit pas modifié.</i>
<i>Je les appelle...</i>
<i>Les Marqués.</i>
<i>Dix agents venus du futur,</i>
<i>introduits dans les corps</i>
<i>de dix éminentes personnes
vivant actuellement.</i>
<i>Leurs corps et leurs esprits
ont été pris en otage</i>
<i>pour mener à bien
les plans du futur.</i>
<i>Leur objectif ?</i>
<i>Contrôler les évènements
dans le monde...</i>
<i>et neutraliser les 4400.</i>
<i>La seule preuve
de leur existence ?</i>
<i>Une marque derrière
le lobe de leur oreille gauche.</i>
<i>Seule trace visible
de l'opération</i>
<i>permettant de greffer
une nouvelle conscience</i>
<i>sur leurs victimes.</i>
<i>Mon film, "Les Marqués",</i>
<i>raconte l'histoire effrayante
de cette conspiration mondiale.</i>
<i>Il révélera des noms,</i>
<i>à commencer
par le premier d'entre eux,</i>
<i>un homme s'appelant...</i>
<i>Matthew Ross.</i>
<i>Matthew Ross était un lobbyiste,
proche de Jordan Collier.</i>
<i>Après avoir été marqué,</i>
<i>sa mission était de manipuler
l'arme ultime des Marqués,</i>
<i>Isabelle Tyler,</i>
<i>afin qu'elle accepte sa mission...</i>
<i>Provoquer la destruction des 4400.</i>
<i>Isabelle, je te l'ai déjà dit.</i>
<i>Tu dois remplir ta mission</i>
<i>et provoquer la destruction
des 4400.</i>
<i>Mais le plan
ne s'est pas déroulé comme prévu.</i>
<i>Je ne crois pas, Matthew.</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui,
c'est la remise des diplômes,</i>
<i>et toi...</i>
<i>tu es ma récompense.</i>
<i>Mais Les Marqués n'ont pas accepté
la défaite sans broncher.</i>
<i>Ils se sont remis à l'oeuvre.</i>
<i>Leurs mains avides</i>
<i>manipulent le monde,
tirant les fils</i>
<i>des marionnettes que nous sommes
à notre insu.</i>
<i>Le groupe s'est rassemblé
pour la première fois</i>
<i>à la demande de Drew Imroth.</i>
<i>Vous avez bien entendu.</i>
<i>Le P.D.G. de la plus grande compagnie
de logiciels au monde</i>
<i>est l'un des Marqués.</i>
Je sais qu'il est dangereux
de se rencontrer tous ensemble,
<i>mais j'ai une information
très importante.</i>
<i>Très... Très importante.</i>
<i>Il vaudrait mieux
que ce soit important, M. Imroth.</i>
<i>C'est la période de Pâques.</i>
<i>Savez-vous à quel point c'est difficile
de quitter le Vatican</i>
<i>pendant Pâques ?</i>
<i>Baissez d'un ton,
votre Éminence.</i>
<i>J'ai une grande nouvelle.</i>
<i>Jordan Collier est de retour</i>
<i>et nous devons l'arrêter...</i>
<i>l'arrêter, définitivement.</i>
<i>"Les Marqués".</i>
<i>Un film à suspens,
disponible partout</i>
<i>en 2008.</i>
Il faut absolument
que j'achète ce film.
Soit, ce sont les divagations
d'un dérangé,
soit Curtis Peck a mis à jour la plus
grande conspiration de tous les temps.
Si on en croit ce film,
Matthew Ross était l'un d'eux,
Les Marqués
et Isabelle Tyler l'a tué.
On s'est toujours demandés
si c'était vrai.
Et pour Imroth ?
Le P.D.G. d'Ubient Software
est censé être une sorte d'agent double
à la solde du futur ?
Tout le monde pense que sa société
essaie de dominer le monde.
Voilà la preuve.
La seule chose dont on soit sûrs,
c'est que Curtis Peck est un infâme,
infâme réalisateur.
Cela dit, je dois reconnaître
qu'il y a pas mal de questions
que j'aimerais lui poser.
Mais tant qu'il ne réapparaît pas,
on devra se contenter de son producteur.
Amenez Stuart Henley ici.
M. Henley,
c'est Diana Skouris, du NTAC.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Vous pouvez ouvrir ?
Ça sent les gaz d'échappement.
Recule.
Rien de surprenant
dans le rapport du légiste,
Stuart Henley est mort
d'empoisonnement au monoxyde de carbone.
Rien n'indique un suicide,
ni aucune preuve d'acte criminel.
Donc...
tu penses vraiment
qu'il s'est suicidé ?
Henley était un type étrange.
Il faut l'être
pour financer les films de Curtis,
donc, je pense que c'est possible.
Mais ce n'est pas logique.
Pourquoi se suiciderait-il
juste après avoir vu
des agents du NTAC ?
Alors, quoi ?
Exécuté par Les Marqués ?
Je ne suis pas prêt d'y croire.
Ouais, moi non plus.
Mais...
Je me pose pas mal de questions.
Tu sais, Drew Imroth
est dans ce film.
Ubient est installé à Seattle.
On pourrait aller le voir demain matin.
Pour lui demander quoi ?
"Excusez-moi.
"À part diriger la plus grande
entreprise de logiciels du monde,
"ne seriez-vous pas impliqué
dans une immense...
"conspiration intercontinentale ?"
Pourquoi pas ?
On peut aussi
juste lui demander si
Curtis Peck a déjà essayé
de le rencontrer.
Ça me va.
On verra ça demain.
- Tu ne rentres pas chez toi ?
- Pas tout de suite.
Meghan m'a demandé
de faire un rapport en mail.
Je lui ai promis pour ce soir.
- Un coup de main ?
- Non, c'est bon. Vas-y.
Va voir ta fille
avant qu'elle ne dorme.
- Merci.
- Bonne nuit.
Merci de prendre le temps
de nous recevoir, M. Imroth.
Aucun problème.
Je suis un fervent admirateur
du NTAC.
Votre boulot n'est pas facile.
Veuillez vous asseoir.
J'aurais aimé
pouvoir plus vous aider.
Je n'ai jamais entendu parler
de ce type.
Vous disiez qu'il s'appelait
Curtis Peck ?
Oui, c'est ça.
C'est un 4400 qui...
réalise des films.
Et vous... êtes un personnage
de son dernier film.
Vraiment ?
Qui joue mon rôle ?
J'ai toujours rêvé que ce soit
Jeff Goldblum.
C'est plus un film
à petit budget.
De quoi ça parle ?
C'est intéressant...
C'est créatif !
Il s'agit d'un complot mondial
dans lequel des agents du futur
ont investi les corps de personnages
importants dans le monde.
Je dois dire que...
je suis le sujet de beaucoup
de théories de complot
mais c'est la plus innovatrice
que j'ai entendue jusqu'ici.
Donc, êtes-vous ici pour me demander
si tout cela est vrai ?
Car vous vous doutez que je ne vous
le dirais pas même si ça l'était.
Non. En fait, nous sommes là,
car Curtis Peck a disparu.
Et il se peut qu'un de ses
investisseurs ait été tué.
Désolé de l'apprendre.
Dois-je m'en faire
pour ma propre sécurité ?
Non, nous ne pensons pas.
Mais...
si Curtis vient
à prendre contact avec vous,
ou que quiconque vous parle
d'un film nommé "Les Marqués",
pourriez-vous nous contacter ?
- Absolument.
- Merci.
Puis-je encore vous être utile ?
En fait...
Ça va vous paraître
vraiment étrange...
Pourrait-on jeter un coup d'oeil
derrière votre lobe d'oreille gauche ?
Laissez-moi deviner,
c'est en rapport avec ce film.
Allez-y.
Cette tâche
a-t-elle toujours été là ?
Depuis ma naissance.
Mon dermatologiste m'a demandé
de la surveiller.
Donc, dites-le-moi tout de suite...
Cela veut-il dire
que je suis un de ces...
C'était quoi, le nom du film ?
"Les Marqués" ?
Kyle, c'est quoi,
ce petit jeu d'espion ?
Suis-je si loin que cela
du cercle de confiance de Collier ?
C'est juste une précaution.
Je veux que tu me promettes
que tu ne vas pas flipper, OK ?
Enlève-moi juste ce truc,
s'il te plaît.
Salut, Shawn.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle fout ici ?
Elle est avec nous.
C'est bon.
Elle voulait te parler
avant que tu ne voies Jordan.
Heureuse que tu te sois réveillé...
et je m'excuse.
Pour tout.
Je sais que j'ai eu tort
et qu'entre nous,
ce n'était pas de l'amour.
Oui, tu peux le dire.
Je ne m'attends pas
à ce que tu me pardonnes...
un jour...
mais je voulais au moins
que tu l'entendes.
Aussi loin qu'on puisse être,
on retrouve toujours
son chemin vers le mouvement.
Même si j'ai dit au monde que tu
as eu tort de distribuer la promicine ?
Je n'ai pas été étonné
qu'ils te montent contre moi.
La politique est
une affaire de compromis.
C'est pour ça que
je ne m'y suis jamais aventuré.
J'ai cru comprendre que
tu souhaites faire le lien
entre les positifs
et le reste du monde.
Mais Shawn, je te le dis,
les choses ont bien changé.
Nous avons de grands projets
et une fois finis, les 4400
n'auront pas besoin des autres.
Ce sont les autres
qui viendront à nous.
C'est ce qu'a dit ton livre ?
Je l'ai lu.
Et il me fait peur.
Tu prétends vraiment amener
Dieu sur Terre ?
Si le mot "Dieu" te fait peur,
remplace-le par "Paradis".
On y arrivera, Shawn.
Tu devrais te joindre à nous.
Mais qui est responsable
du Paradis ?
Combien de martyrs
faudra-t-il pour le créer ?
Jordan, tu as beaucoup oeuvré
pour les 4400 et pour moi,
mais tu te trompes ce coup-ci.
Et tu as toujours été rebelle.
Mais je crois que tu as peur
du changement, Shawn,
ou alors, peur de moi ?
Je suis contre celui
qui veut tous les pouvoirs
sans me dire exactement
ce qu'il veut en faire.
Pas seulement toi,
n'importe qui.
Il y a un gars
nommé Gabriel Hewitt.
Il est candidat à la Mairie.
Il est dangereux.
Maia Skouris l'a vu
dans une vision.
Il s'occupe
de camps de prisonniers
et organise des rafles de 4400.
Même si je voulais retirer
ma candidature,
même si je voulais
vous rejoindre...
Je ne pourrais pas,
car je dois l'arrêter.
On dirait
que tu as déjà bien à faire.
Bonne chance
pour ta carrière politique.
Je suis désolé.
Oui, mais cette marque
derrière l'oreille d'Imroth ?
Elle avait vraiment la forme
d'un "X".
Exactement comme celles
des films de Curtis.
C'était bizarre, oui.
Mais ça peut être
une coïncidence.
On cherche un 4400 parano,
pas besoin de le devenir nous-mêmes.
Cet homme veut vous voir.
Je suis Walt Saperstein,
psychiatre à l'hôpital de Feeney.
Je dois vous emmener à l'hôpital.
Vous serez placé en détention
psychiatrique durant 72 heures.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi ?
Vous avez envoyé
un mail hier soir.
Vous affirmez que
d'importantes personnes
sont unis par une sorte
de conspiration.
C'est pas une déclaration.
C'est un résumé
de notre affaire.
Quoi qu'il en soit,
quelqu'un à Washington l'a lu.
Ils ont revu votre dossier,
agent Baldwin.
- Vous seriez psychotique...
- La ferme !
Vous l'avez envoyé à Washington ?
Je le fais
à chaque nouvelle affaire.
Désolée. Je ne l'aurais pas fait
si j'avais su ce qui arriverait.
Lâchez-moi !
Tom, vous aggravez votre cas
si vous vous débattez.
C'est temporaire.
Suivez-les.
Nous ferons tout
pour régler ça au plus vite.
Très bien...
Je ne comprends pas.
Qu'entendez-vous par,
"Personne ne peut le voir" ?
Combien de temps Tom
va-t-il rester en isolation ?
OK. Laissez tomber.
Je rappellerai demain.
Pas un geste.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Ne tirez pas !
Je suis celui
que vous recherchez.
Vous êtes vivant.
En effet.
Si vous faites en sorte
que je le reste,
je vous dirai tout
sur Les Marqués.
Comment m'avez-vous trouvée ?
Je me cache depuis que
j'ai fait cette bande-annonce.
Je savais
qu'ils s'en prendraient à moi.
Mon pote Neal m'a envoyé un mail
après votre venue chez moi.
Il dit que je peux avoir confiance.
Que pouvez-vous me dire
sur ces gens ?
Je ne sais pas tout.
Je n'ai pas fini
d'écrire le scénario.
C'est comme ça
que marche ma capacité.
Les idées déboulent dans ma tête
lorsque j'écris.
Mais je connais toute l'histoire
qu'après avoir écrit la fin.
Voyons voir...
Ils n'ont pas de capacités.
Ce n'est pas leur façon de faire.
Je sais que tous les dix
se sont vus en 2005.
C'est la seule fois
où ils étaient tous réunis.
C'était à Tunis,
une ville nord-africaine.
Aucun autre nom
que Drew Imroth ?
Pas encore.
Je vous cherchais pour ça.
Il me faut un lieu sûr
pour écrire.
Vous êtes fan de mes films.
Oui, je les ai tous vus.
C'est un plaisir
de vous accueillir.
Oui, installez-vous là,
si vous voulez.
Merci beaucoup, Marco.
J'apprécie vraiment.
On a pris soin
de ne pas être suivis.
OK. Je le surveille.
Ça fait longtemps que
tu n'étais pas venue chez moi, hein ?
Il faudrait faire du café.
Ça vous dérange de rester ?
J'aime avoir quelqu'un...
avec qui discuter de mes idées.
Du café.
Il faudrait que vous repoussiez
quelques rendez-vous d'aujourd'hui.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Gabriel Hewitt a eu une attaque
la nuit dernière.
- Quoi ?
- C'est grave...
Apparemment, le cerveau est touché.
On dit qu'il va devoir renoncer
à son siège municipal
et se retirer de la course
à la mairie.
Je viens d'avoir l'hôpital
au téléphone.
Tom va bien.
Si je maintiens la pression, il pourrait
être relâché un jour plus tôt.
- Vous travaillez sur quoi ?
- Je vous le dis ?
Ou je me contente
de l'écrire dans un e-mail ?
C'est injuste.
Je n'ai rien à voir
avec tout ça,
je n'ai pas pu l'empêcher.
La détention de Tom n'a rien
à voir avec son état psychologique.
On approche de quelque chose,
et ils nous mettent en garde.
Qui ça ? Ceux du film de Curtis ?
Les Marqués ?
Eh bien, je ne peux rien prouver,
mais je sais que Drew Imroth
était en Tunisie en juin 2005.
Si les Marqués se sont déjà réunis,
c'était là.
Welsey Burke y était aussi
à cette époque.
Le conseiller politique
du Président ?
Que faisait-il en Afrique
au moment des élections
de mi-mandat ?
Aucune idée, mais il n'était pas seul.
Voilà le Cardinal Emmanuel Calabria.
Il paraît qu'il a fini 3e
à la dernière élection pontificale.
Tout ça est passionnant,
mais, Drew Imroth dirige
la plus grande fondation au monde.
Il va très souvent en Afrique
et ces autres hommes, eh bien...
Allez savoir
pourquoi ils y étaient.
Eh bien, je trouverai.
Et je découvrirai aussi
qui d'autre était là-bas
cette semaine-là.
Faites-moi signe si je peux aider.
Les Marqués sont incapable
de communiquer avec le futur.
C'est un aller simple.
Ils sont seuls.
Curtis, tout ça est passionnant,
mais on n’a toujours pas de noms.
Il nous faut des faits,
des choses qu'on puisse vérifier.
Ça arrive, je suis bien parti.
Tom, tout va bien ?
<i>Ils m'ont fait quelque chose, Diana.</i>
Ils m'ont transformé.
Calme-toi.
Où es-tu ?
À l'hôpital.
<i>Ils viennent de me laisser sortir.</i>
<i>Tu peux venir me chercher ?</i>
T'es sûr que c'était pas déjà là ?
Sûr et certain.
Ils m'ont fait quelque chose,
ils sont entrés dans ma chambre,
habillés comme pour une opération.
- Ils m'ont injecté quelque chose.
- Quoi ? Comme une...
Une autre personnalité ?
Une autre conscience ?
Tom, je ne pense pas
que ça marche comme ça.
Curtis travaille sur son scénario,
et selon lui,
Les Marqués sont isolés du futur.
Ils ne peuvent pas se multiplier.
Mais l'un d'entre eux est mort.
Matthew Ross
et s'ils avaient pris ce qui était
en lui pour me l'inoculer ?
Tu n'en sais rien.
Tom... s'il te plaît,
dis-moi que tu es encore toi-même.
Je pense.
Enfin, pour l'instant.
C'est de la merde.
J'arrive pas à écrire cette scène.
Ils sont en Tunisie,
pendant leur réunion.
Ils se rencontrent
pour la première fois.
Imroth les présente
les uns aux autres.
Je vois la scène.
Mais j'arrive pas...
- à la retranscrire.
- Écoutez...
Moi aussi, je dois être
inventif dans mon boulot.
Je partage mon bureau
avec deux des mecs
les plus casse-pieds de la planète.
Croyez-moi,
je me retrouve souvent coincé.
Vous savez ce que je fais ?
Je ferme les yeux
et je pense aux paroles
d'une chanson.
Ça a l'air débile, hein ?
Mais je jure que
ça marche à chaque fois.
Vous pensez à quoi ?
<i>The trooper</i>, d'Iron Maiden.
Tout ce qui pourrait
vous faire avancer.
Je reviens.
C'est toi ?
C'est toi qui as ordonné à l'un
de tes adeptes de provoquer l'attaque ?
On est devenus si différents ?
Tu me crois vraiment capable de ça ?
Je sais plus
ce dont tu es capable,
Mais je sais qu'il y a 2 jours,
je t'ai dit
que Hewitt était dangereux.
Maintenant, son cerveau est endommagé
et sa carrière probablement terminée.
On dirait que le destin a agi
en notre nom.
Tu ne réponds pas à ma question.
Parce que je la trouve insultante !
Tu répètes sans cesse
qu'on est en guerre,
Hewitt pourrait en être
une nouvelle victime.
Comme tous ceux qui sont morts
à cause de tes doses.
Ils ont fait un choix.
Ils connaissaient les risques.
Je connaissais les risques.
Je n'ai jamais donné l'ordre
d'attaquer Gabriel Hewitt.
Je ne te crois pas.
Tu ne peux pas savoir
à quel point ça me déçoit.
C'est pourtant vrai.
C'est pour ça que je ne peux plus
te suivre.
Tu as pu voir la plaque
de la voiture qui l'a emmené ?
Désolé.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait maintenant ?
On en parle à Meghan,
que tout le monde participe,
en espérant trouver Curtis
avant que le pire ne se produise.
Je viens d'apprendre que
vous avez été relâché, tout va bien ?
Ouais, en partie.
On venait justement vous voir,
pour vous parler de Curtis Peck.
Il y a 2 jours, il est venu
demander notre protection.
On a essayé de le garder en sécurité,
mais on l'a perdu.
On pense que les Marqués l'ont enlevé.
Curtis Peck est ici.
Il est arrivé il y a 1 h.
Il est allé à l'infirmerie
pour son contrôle.
Désolé d'être parti si vite,
je sais que
ça va vous paraître bizarre,
mais j'ai reçu un coup de fil
de la part de...
ce gros producteur
qui est en ville.
Il apprécie beaucoup mon travail.
Il m'a proposé de réaliser
un film à Hollywood.
"Don Incubus,
Détective Privé pour Démons."
C'est l'adaptation d'un comic.
C'est parfait pour moi.
Je suis dans la place !
C'est que j'ai toujours voulu.
Et la conspiration dans tout ça ?
- Les Marqués ?
- Vous aviez presque fini,
vous alliez nous révéler les noms.
Les noms ?
Il n'y a pas de noms.
Pas vraiment.
J'ai tout inventé.
J'abandonne, je ne peux pas terminer.
Ils vous ont eu.
Ils vous ont acheté, hein ?
Vous y avez vraiment cru, hein ?
Écoutez, je suis flatté,
mais vous devez vous calmer.
Les Marqués n'existent pas.
Et Robert Shaftoe
n'a pas tué JFK.
Ce ne sont que des films.
Alors...
Désolé d'avoir manqué mes contrôles.
C'est la dernière fois.
Je peux partir ?
Je dois faire mes bagages.
Je vais à Hollywood !
Il n'a rien d'anormal.
J'ai passé l'après-midi
à l'infirmerie
et pour eux,
rien n'a changé chez moi.
C'est une bonne chose.
C'est de la manipulation,
ils voulaient qu'on arrête l'enquête.
Ça marchera pas,
on découvrira la vérité sur ces gens,
avec ou sans Curtis Peck.
Excusez-moi.
Agent Baldwin, agent Skouris ?
Désolé de venir à l'improviste.
J'ai demandé à mon chauffeur
de faire un détour.
J'arrive pas à m'ôter
ce film de dingue de la tête.
Quel était son titre,
"Les Marqués" ?
Vous connaissez très bien son titre.
Sûrement.
J'arrête pas de chercher à savoir
quel effet ça ferait
si j'étais vraiment
l'un d'entre eux.
Imaginez-vous,
coincé dans le passé,
isolé de vos amis,
de votre famille.
Ce serait un sacré sacrifice, non ?
Ce sont des héros selon moi.
Les héros n'assassinent pas des gens
et n'annihilent pas les consciences
de personnes innocentes.
Je ne connais pas
le but de ces Marqués,
je n'ai pas vu le film.
Et vous ne le verrez jamais.
Personne ne le verra.
C'est peut-être mieux comme ça.
Le secret leur est plus profitable
pour pouvoir travailler.
S'ils existent,
j'imagine
que vous les considéreriez
comme...
Je ne sais pas... Des alliés ?
Après tout,
vous partagez le même but, non ?
Arrêter la révolution
menée par Jordan Collier
et, empêcher le chaos et l'agitation
qu'elle pourrait causer.
Je les vois simplement
comme des renforts.
Des renforts très précieux.
Seulement si...
- ils existent.
- Exactement.
S'ils existent.
Bref, ravi de vous
avoir parlé à nouveau,
je dois aller chercher ma femme.
Nous sommes reçus...
à l'Organisation mondiale
de la Santé ce soir.
On dirait des radios,
tout va bien ?
Ça n'a pas marché.
Quoi que vous ayez essayé de me faire,
ça a foiré.
Je suis toujours moi.
Bien sûr que oui.
Nous sommes tous nous-mêmes,
n'est-ce pas ?
Qui d'autre pourrions-nous être ?
Il t'a fait douter de moi, pas vrai ?
Ton cousin, il t'a fait douter de moi.
La coïncidence est troublante.
Pour l'attaque d'Hewitt.
Si tu as quelque chose à me demander,
je te répondrai franchement.
C'était vous ?
Vous êtes derrière tout ça ?
Non.
Je vous crois.
Je suis désolé pour Shawn.
Moi aussi.
Shawn était comme un fils pour moi
et je l'ai perdu.
Mais je t'ai trouvé, toi.
Merci.
Ne me remerciez pas, changez.
Je pense
qu'il n'y a pas à s'inquiéter.
Tout ira bien.
Dis aux autres que
je suis allé voir les agents du NTAC.
Baldwin pense
que c'est un stratagème,
une manipulation.
Quand on aura besoin de lui,
il sera là pour nous.

The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...
<i>You're
the alternative we need
<i>to Collier and his
promicin-pushing radicals.
Does that mean you'll run
for city council?
It means I'm gonna run
and I'm gonna win.
I intend on attacking you
right up until the day of the election.
There are a lot of people out there
that are afraid of what you represent.
<i>I have my eye on something greater
than just city council.
<i>- You hate all the 4400.
- So what if I do?
<i>I have reason to believe
that you're capable of terrible things,
and that you have an evil
living inside of you.
I'm supposed to eliminate
the 4400.
All this talk of a catastrophe
the 4400 are supposed to prevent?
- It's lies.
- So you keep telling me.
<i>Everything in that book
is going to come true.
Collier will lead
the human race to salvation.
You will help him.
<I>I found the guy for the job.
<i>His name's Robert Shaftoe.
<i>Ex-Marine.
<i>Dead-eye sniper.
<i>He did some work
for our...
<i>organization,
out of Kansas City.
<i>If you want someone killed,
<i>until they're completely dead,
<i>then Shaftoe's your man.
<i>Sounds good.
<i>Bring him in.
<i>Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?
<i>Because once I bring Shaftoe
through that door,
<i>there's no going back.
<i>The target...
<i>is a dead man.
- <i>Completely.</i>
- Oh, my God.
Come on, the acting, the dialogue,
this is horrendous.
- Marco, why are we watching this?
- Just, shh...
The best part's coming up.
<i>The assignment is dangerous.
<i>In fact, it might be
the most dangerous assignment
<i>you've ever been assigned.
<i>But if you succeed,
<i>the danger will be worth it.
<i>And the rewards?
<i>They will be worth...
the danger.
<i>Danger is my business.
<i>Consider the target dead.
<i>Completely...
<i>dead.
That's our guy.
That's Curtis Peck.
He's an original recipe 4400.
Correction...
- He's our favorite original recipe.
- Before he disappeared,
Curtis wrote, directed,
and starred in horror movies.
Real low-Budget stuff.
You know,
the sets were mostly in his house.
The actors?
Pretty much
just his friends and family.
Really?
I never would have guessed.
After he came back,
Curtis kept on making movies,
but he shifted genres.
Each one of his movies
is about an unsolved mystery.
He did one about
Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance.
He filmed a costume drama
in his backyard
about the lost colonies at Roanoke.
You just saw his take
on JFK's assassination.
That's great, Marco.
I'm glad this guy has a hobby.
It's not just a hobby.
Some people think that
making these films
- is Curtis's 4400 ability.
- Come on, guys,
you're not telling us
that that movie...
tells us what really happened
to president Kennedy?
There's no way
to know for sure,
but, I mean,
there really is an ex-Marine
named Robert Shaftoe,
and he really was in Dallas
on november 22nd, 1963.
You can't prove Curtis is right,
but you also can't deny
that his theories are compelling.
Some people want to think
everything is a conspiracy,
and I'm sure that this guy
is really appealing to them,
but, Marco,
we've got  a lot of stuff on our plate,
and we just don't have time
to look into something
that might be a 4400 ability.
Don't think I could sit through
another one of those movies.
We didn't ask you down here
to tell you about his ability.
Curtis disappeared.
Nobody can find him.
About 10 days ago,
he stopped posting on his myspace page.
We noticed, so we tried
to get in touch with him.
He's not picking up the phone,
he's not answering emails.
I know, I know,
no big deal, right?
I wasn't really worried
until he missed his last NTAC check-in.
Curtis Peck has dropped off the map.
Somebody should look into it.
- What is this place?
- I don't know,
Cassie just said
we should come here.
I think it's an old bomb shelter.
We should be safe here. It doesn't look
like anyone's been here in years.
I don't understand
why we came to Seattle.
We just led a hundred people
into a city
where everyone's looking for us.
Nobody has a place to stay.
Nobody knows what to do next.
Are you telling me
this is the answer?
- This place is a mess.
- We'll repair it.
Thank you for finding this for us.
You have a truly
extraordinary ability.
Get everyone settled in.
This place is perfect.
We begin here.
How much you wanna bet
we're about to wake up a man
with a crushing  hangover?
Curtis!
Curtis Peck!
You think someone
broke into the place?
Maybe, or else this guy's
as bad at housekeeping
as he is at making movies.
It doesn't look like anything's missing.
All his video equipment is sitting here.
Are you looking for Curtis?
Yes, we are.
We're from NTAC.
- Do you know him?
- Of course.
I'm Neal Handler.
I live around back.
I'm Curtis' neighbor.
And... his collaborator.
I'm proud to say
I've been in more of his movies
than anyone else.
- Yeah, we've... seen your work.
- Thank you.
I haven't seen Curtis in a few days.
Is he all right?
Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.
Do you know
if Curtis had any enemies,
or anyone who might want
to break into his house?
Enemies?
Take your pick.
The CIA, the mafia...
the freemasons.
Curtis exposed
a lot of people.
So you...
you believe his movies are real?
Of course.
That's why
they brought him back
in a ball of light.
To tell the truth
to a reluctant world!
I'll tell you what, though,
if someone did toss this place,
I can guarantee you they didn't find
what they were looking for.
Curtis has...
a secret hiding place.
He keeps his journal in there.
All his script notes.
Could you show it to us?
We just want to help out your friend,
That's all.
We really like his movies, too.
I mean,
we just saw the one on JFK,
and it was... good.
You were really good.
It's here.
Here.
Curtis uses those
for inspiration.
<i>If you're watching this,
then that means I'm in trouble.
<i>Deep trouble.
<i>Don't believe anything you hear
about a car accident or a suicide.
<i>If I'm gone,
it's because they came after me.
<i>I have an idea for a new movie.
<i>It's big.
It's so big,
<i>it's going to change everything
if I get to make it,
<i>and that's
what they're scared of.
<i>That's them.
They're here now.
<i>You need to know,
Jordan Collier...
<i>the 4400... they're not the ones
you should be scared of.
<i>There's something else out there,
something worse,...
<I>it's much worse,
and they're coming for me now.

<i>The Marked

<i>...consider the target dead.
<i>Completely dead.
According to Curtis, Jimmy Hoffa
was buried in the Florida everglades.
If you really believe that,
you should read this.
I ran a background check
on Curtis.
He owes money
to credit card companies, the IRS.
He's three years behind
on his alimony payments.
I talked to his ex-wife.
She moved to Wisconsin
just to get away from Curtis.
She hasn't heard from him
in nine months.
Look, if anybody's coming
after this guy, it should be...
creditors, or movie critics.
But he has almost 6 figures
of outstanding debt.
Isn't it possible
he just skipped town?
I don't know.
He looked genuinely scared
at the end of that video we found,
and I don't think Curtis is
a good enough actor to fake that.
Besides...
if making movies is really
his 4400 ability...
aren't you even just
a little bit curious ?
Don't you want to know what's out there
that's bigger than Jordan Collier?
Until we have evidence
that tells me this guy's legit,
all I want to do
is make sure he's okay.
Look at the credits.
Ever since Curtis got back,
his movies have been produced
by a guy called Stuart Henley.
I checked him out.
He's a retired lawyer.
He lives nearby.
Maybe he'd know something
about Curtis' latest movie idea.
It's worth a shot.
At the very least, I'd like to look
into the eyes of the man who put up...
good money to pay for
"I dismembered Jimmy Hoffa."
<i>No, I don't think that
my announcement
<I>that I intend to run for mayor
<I>will mean that
I'll be spending less time
<I>monitoring
Shawn Farrell's candidacy.
<I>If anything,
I think that the mayor's office
<I>would allow me a stronger platform
with which to oppose him...
Mr. Farrell?
- This just came by messenger.
- Thank you.
We're going to be working together
every day. You can call me Shawn.
<i>Hey, Shawn...
it's Kyle.
Where are you?
I've been worried about you.
I'm fine, man.
I'm better than fine, actually.
I'm as good as I've been
in a long time.
Did you get the package?
You sent this?
<i>We did.
Look, it's really important, man.
You need to read the whole thing
before your meeting.
What meeting, Kyle?
<i>Jordan's nearby.
He wants to see you.
You're with Jordan?
What does he want
to see me about?
It's important, okay?
Call me on this number
after you finish the book.
We'll send someone
to come get you.
Mr. Henley?
I can hear a radio
playing inside,
and I swear I heard
someone moving around.
Mr. Henley!
He's back here.
Stuart Henley, wait!
Just wait!
I promise
I won't tell anybody!
- Don't kill me!
- Just relax.
- Nobody's going to kill you.
- We're from NTAC.
We're just trying to locate
Curtis Peck.
You won't find him.
They got to him.
Who are they?
Why'd you run from us?
What are you so scared of?
The people from Curtis' movie...
"The Marked."
That's the name of his movie?
Can you tell us about it?
About a month ago,
he came to me,
said he had an idea
for a new movie,
called "The Marked."
He said it was
his biggest film yet.
I was fascinated,
so I asked him to make me
a short trailer.
I like to see what the movie's about
before I write a check.
He gave me the trailer
about two weeks ago.
Do you still have a copy?
And you're more than welcome
to it, because...
if what Curtis is saying is true,
Then I wish to God
I had never watched it.
<i>This is the world.
<i>Look familiar?
<i>It should,
<i>and it shouldn't.
<i>We all know it changed forever
when the 4400 came back.
<i>Their mission?
<i>They were sent back
by the future
<i>to stop a catastrophe.
<i>But not everyone
from the future
<i>thought they were
a good thing.
<i>There's a faction of elites
<I>who want the future
to stay exactly as it is.
<i>I call them...
<i>The Marked.
<i>10 agents from the future,
<i>inserted into the bodies
<i>of 10 prominent people
from today.
<i>Their bodies and minds
have been hijacked
<i>to pursue the agenda
of the future.
<i>Their goal?
<i>To guide world events...
<i>and to stop the 4400.
<i>The only evidence they exist?
<i>a mark behind
their left earlobe.
<i>The remnant of the procedure
<i>that grafted
a new consciousness
<I>onto their victims.</I>
<i>My movie,
"The Marked",
<i>will tell the chilling tale
of this global conspiracy.
<i>It will name names,
<i>starting with the appearance
of the first marked,
<i>a man named...
<i>Matthew Ross.
<i>Matthew Ross was a lobbyist
with access to Jordan Collier.
<i>After he was marked,
<i>his job was to guide
The Marked's ultimate weapon,
<i>Isabelle Tyler,
<i>into accepting her role
<i>as the agent
of the 4400's destruction.
Isabelle, I told you.
You have to accept your role
as the agent
of the 4400's destruction.
<i>But everything did not go
according to plan.
I don't think so, Matthew.
Today's graduation day,
and you're...
my diploma.
<i>But The Marked do not accept
defeat lying down.
<i>They continue to plan.
<i>They have their greedy fingers
<i>on the marionette strings
of the world,
<i>and we, their puppets,
don't even know it.
<i>The group gathered
for the first time
<i>at the behest of Drew Imroth.
<i>That's right.
<i>The CEO of the biggest
software company in the world
<i>is one of The Marked.
I know it's dangerous for us all
to meet like this,
but the information I have
is important...
Very, very important.
It better be important,
Mr. Imroth.
It's easter.
Do you know how hard it is
to get away from the vatican
at easter?
Take it down a notch,
your eminence.
I have big news.
Jordan collier is back,
and we need to stop him...
completely stop him.
<i>"The Marked."
<i>A direct market thriller
available in all territories
<I>in 2008.</I>
I am so buying that movie.
So either that's
the ramblings of a madman,
or Curtis Peck has just exposed
the biggest conspiracy of all time.
According to that movie,
Matthew Ross was one of these guys,
The Marked,
and Isabelle Tyler killed him.
And we always wondered
if that were true.
What about Imroth?
I mean, the CEO
of Ubient Software
is supposed to be some kind
of double agent from the future?
Everyone always says that company
is trying to take over the world.
Now we know it's true.
The only thing we know for sure
is that Curtis Peck is a horrible,
horrible film-maker.
Though, I do have to admit,
there are a bunch of questions
I'd like to ask him.
But since he's in the wind, I guess
we'll have to settle for his producer.
Get Stuart Henley in here.
Mr. Henley,
it's Diana Skouris from NTAC.
We need to talk.
Can you open up?
It smells like exhaust.
Stand back.
No big surprises
in the coroner's preliminary reports,
Stuart Henley died
of carbon monoxide poisoning.
There's no suicide note,
but there's no sign of foul play either.
So...
do you really think
he committed suicide?
Henley was an odd guy.
I mean, He'd have to be to pay
for Curtis' movies,
so I guess it's possible.
But I don't know,
the timing seems off.
Why would he commit suicide
right after NTAC
got in touch with him?
So, what then?
Executed by the marked?
I'm not ready to go there yet.
Yeah, me neither.
But I...
I got a lot of questions.
You know Drew Imroth
is in that movie.
Ubient's based in Seattle. Maybe we can
get in and see him tomorrow morning.
And ask him what exactly?
Oh, I got it,
"Excuse me.
"When you're not running the biggest
computer company in the world,
"are you by any chance involved in
an enormous...
"intercontinental conspiracy?"
Maybe.
Or maybe we could just ask him
whether
Curtis Peck ever tried
to get in touch with him.
Sounds good.
I'll see tomorrow.
- What, you're not going home?
- No, not for a while.
Meghan asked me to put all this
in an email.
I told her I'd get it off
to her tonight.
- Want a hand?
- No, I got it. Go ahead.
Spend a little time with your daughter
while she's still awake.
- Thanks.
- Good night.
We appreciate you taking
the time to meet with us, Mr. Imroth.
It's really not a problem.
I'm a huge supporter of NTAC.
You guys have tough jobs.
Please,have a seat.
I only wish I could be
more helpful.
I've never heard of this guy.
You said his name was
Curtis Peck ?
Yeah, that's right. He's a...
He's a 4400 who...
who makes movies,
and you,
well, you're a character
in his latest film.
Really?
Who plays me?
I always hoped
it would be Jeff Goldblum.
It's more of a low-budget
kind of thing.
What's it about?
Well, it's interesting.
It's creative.
It's a global conspiracy
in which agents from the future
have taken over
the bodies of...
prominent people
from all around the world.
I have to say,
I'm the subject of
a lot of conspiracy theories,
but that's the most innovative
one I've heard yet.
So, are you here to ask me
if it's true?
Because you have to figure
I wouldn't tell you even if it was.
No, actually, we came to see you
because Curtis Peck has gone missing.
There's a chance one of his
investors may have been murdered.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Should I be worried for
my own safety?
No, we don't think so,
but if Curtis should try
and get in touch with you,
or if anyone should ask you
about a movie called
"The Marked",
could you get in touch
with us?
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.
Is there anything else
I can help you with?
Actually...
This may seem like
a really strange request.
Do you think we could take a look
behind your left earlobe?
Let me guess,
this has something to do
with that movie.
Have at it.
Has that mole
always been there?
Ever since I was born.
My dermatologist tells me
I have to keep an eye on it.
So give it to me straight.
Does this mean I'm one of the...
What was the name
of that movie?
"The Marked?"
Kyle, what's with all
the spy game stuff here?
Am I really this far outside
of the Collier circle of trust?
It's just a precaution.
I need you to promise me that
you're not going to freak out, okay?
I would just like
to take this thing off, please.
Hi, Shawn.
- What the hell is she doing here?
- She's with us. It's okay.
She just wanted to talk to you
before you saw Jordan.
I'm glad you're awake...
and I'm sorry.
For everything.
I know I was wrong,
and I know
what we had wasn't love.
Yeah, you're right, it wasn't.
I don't expect you
to forgive me...
Ever...
But I just needed you
to hear it.
Well,
there's no one so far gone
they can't find their way
back to the movement.
Even if I told the world that you
were wrong to hand out promicin?
I wasn't surprised
they had you speak against me.
Politics is compromise.
That's why
I never pursued it myself.
I understand that you are
wanting to build a bridge
between positives
and the rest of the world,
but, Shawn, I'm telling you,
events are moving past that.
We have big plans here,
and when we're finished,
the 4400 won't need the mainstream.
The mainstream will come to us.
Is that what your book told you?
I've read it.
Frankly, it scares me.
Are you saying that you're gonna
bring God to the world?
If the word "God" frightens you,
substitute "paradise".
We're gonna make it happen, Shawn.
You should be here with us.
Yes, but who's
in charge of paradise?
How many martyrs
will it take to create it?
Jordan, you've done
great things for the 4400.
You have done great things
for me, but...
you are on the wrong path here.
And you have always been rebellious.
But I think you're afraid
of change, Shawn,
or it is just me?
I'm against anyone
who wants to accumulate power
that won't tell me exactly
what they wanna do with it.
Not just you, anyone.
There's a man by the name
of Gabriel Hewitt.
He's running for mayor.
He's dangerous.
Maia Skouris
saw him in a vision.
He's in charge
of prison camps,
and they're
rounding up 4400s.
Even if I wanted to
drop out of the race,
even if I wanted to join you,
I can't,
because I have to stop him.
Well, it sounds like you have
your hands full already.
Good luck
in your political career.
I'm sorry.
I don't know, but that birthmark
behind Imroth's ear?
It was definitely
shaped like an "x".
Exactly like the ones
in Curtis' movies.
It was weird, yes,
but it could be
a coincidence.
We're looking for
a paranoid 4400.
That doesn't mean we have to
become paranoid ourselves.
This man is here to see you.
My name's Walt Saperstein.
I'm a psychiatrist
at Feeney Memorial.
I have instructions
to bring you to the hospital.
You're being placed under
a 72-hour psychiatric hold.
What? Why?
You sent an email last night.
It alleged some of the most
powerful people in the world
are united
in some kind of conspiracy.
No, it didn't allege anything.
It's a summary of our work
on a case.
Well, nevertheless,
someone in Washington read it.
They've reviewed your files,
agent Baldwin. They're worried
- you've had a psychotic break.
- Shut up.
You sent my email on to D.C.?
I do that every time
we open a case. I'm sorry.
I never would've done it
if I knew this was gonna happen.
Get your hands off me!
It's only going to
get worse for you
if you put up a fight.
It's only temporary.
You need to go with them. We'll do
everything we can to end this quickly.
Fine.
Well, I don't understand.
What do you mean that no one
can get in to see him?
Well, how long is Tom
going to be in isolation?
Okay, forget it.
I'll call back in the morning.
Don't move.
What are you doing down here?
Don't shoot me.
I'm the one
you're looking for.
Curtis?
You're alive.
I am.
If you can keep me that way,
I'll tell you
all about The Marked.
So how did you find me?
I've been in hiding ever since
I made that movie trailer.
I knew they'd be coming for me.
My buddy, Neal,
sent me an email
after you and your partner
came by my house.
He thought I could trust you.
What can you tell me
about these people?
Well, not everything.
I haven't finished
writing the script.
That's how
my ability works.
Ideas just jump into
my head while I'm writing,
but I don't know the whole story
until I write the end.
Let's see,
they don't have abilities.
The procedure
doesn't work that way.
I do know that all 10 of them
had a meeting in 2005.
That was the only time
they were all together.
It was in Tunis.
That's a city in North Africa.
No other names
other than Drew Imroth?
Not yet.
That's why I came to you.
I need a safe place
where I can write.
You're a fan of my movies.
Cool.
Yeah, I've seen them all.
Uh, it's a pleasure
to have you here.
Yeah, you can work right there
if you want.
Thank you so much, Marco.
I really appreciate this.
We were careful on the way
over here. We weren't followed.
It's okay.
I'll keep him working.
It's been a while since you've seen
the inside of my place, huh?
We should make
a pot of coffee.
Do you mind staying up with me?
I like to have somebody I can...
bounce ideas off.
Coffee.
Hey, Joanna, I'm going to need you
to juggle around
a couple of my healing
appointments for today.
What is it?
Gabriel Hewitt
had a stroke last night.
- What?
- It's bad.
I guess he has brain damage.
They're saying he's going to
have to resign his seat
on the city council,
and withdraw
from the race for mayor.
I just got off the phone
with the hospital.
Tom is fine.
If I keep the pressure on,
there's a chance
they may end his psych hold
a day early.
- What are you working on?
- You want me to tell you,
or should I just
put it an email?
That's not fair.
I had nothing to do with
what happened to Tom.
If I could've stopped it,
I would've.
Tom's psych hold had nothing
to do with his state of mind.
We were getting close to something,
and they sent us a warning.
Who? The people from
Curtis' movie, The Marked?
Well, I can't prove that,
but I do know that Drew Imroth
was in Tunisia of June, 2005.
If The Marked ever gathered,
that's when it happened.
At the same time,
Wesley Burke was also there.
The political advisor
to the president?
What was he doing in Africa
while the White House
was gearing up
for mid-term elections?
I don't know,
but he had company.
That's cardinal Emmanuel Calabria.
Rumor is, he finished third
in the last papal election.
This is all interesting,
but Drew Imroth heads up
the world's largest
charitable foundation.
He travels to Africa
all the time,
and these other guys,
well...
Who knows why they were there.
Well, I'm going to find out,
And I'm also gonna learn
who else was there
to play that week.
Let me know if I can help.
The Marked have no way of
getting in contact with the future.
It's a one-way ticket.
They're cut off here.
Okay, Curtis,
that's very interesting,
but there are
no new names here.
We need some facts
and things that we can verify.
They'll come.
I'm on a roll.
Tom, are you okay?
<i>They did something to me, Diana.</i>
They changed me.
Whoa, just take it easy.
Where are you?
The hospital.
<i>They just let me out.</i>
<i>Can you come and get me?</i>
Are you sure
it wasn't there before?
I'm positive.
They did something to me
last night, Diana.
Those people who came into my room,
They were dressed
for an operation.
They put something into me.
What? Like another person?
Another consciousness?
Hey, Tom, I don't think
it works that way.
Curtis is working on
his script right now,
and according to him, The Marked
are cut off from the future.
They can't just
make more of them.
Yeah, but one of them's dead.
Matthew Ross.
What if they took whatever was
inside of him and put it into me?
No, you can't be sure of that.
Tom, just...
please just tell me
that you're still you.
I think so.
I mean, for now, anyway.
It's crap.
I can't get this scene right.
they're at the meeting
in Tunisia.
They're face to face
for the first time.
Imroth is introducing them
to each other.
I know what the scene is.
I just can't...
- nail it.
- Look...
I have to think creatively
for my job, too.
I mean, I share an office
with two of the most
annoying guys on the planet.
Believe me,
I get stuck all the time.
Know what I do?
I shut my eyes,
and I think of song lyrics.
Sounds dumb, right?
But I swear,
it almost always works.
What are you thinking of?
"The trooper", <i>Iron Maiden.
Hey, whatever gets you going.
Be right back.
Did you do this?
Did you do this?
Did you order
one of your followers
to give Hewitt a stroke?
Have we grown that far apart?
You actually believe
I'm capable of that?
Jordan, I don't know what
you're capable of anymore.
All I know I that two days ago
I came in here ad I told you
that Hewitt as dangerous.
Now he has brain damage
and he probably
won't have a career.
Then it looks like
fate intervened on our behalf.
You're not answering my question.
Because I find it offensive!
You're the one who's always
saying that we're at war.
Why wouldn't Hewitt just
be another casualty to you?
Just like all those people
that died taking your shot?
Those people made a choice.
They knew the risks.
I knew the risks.
I did not order anyone
to attack Gabriel Hewitt.
I don't believe you.
I can't begin to tell you
how disappointing that is.
Well, it's true.
That's why
I can't follow you anymore.
Did you see the license plate
on the car that took him away?
I'm sorry.
What do we do now?
We need to tell Meghan,
bring the whole building into this,
hope we find Curtis
before the worst happens.
They just told me
you were released.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Pretty much.
We were coming to see you. We need
to talk to you about Curtis Peck.
He came to me for protection
a couple of nights ago.
We tried to keep him safe,
but we lost him.
We think The Marked took him.
Guys, Curtis Peck is
in the building.
He came in about an hour ago.
He went straight down
to NTAC medical for his checkup.
Sorry I had to rush out.
I know this is going to
sound weird,
but I got a call from this...
from this big movie producer
who's in town.
He's a big fan of my work.
He offered me a deal to direct
a big Hollywood movie.
Don Incubus, demon P.I.
It's a comic book adaptation.
It's perfect for me.
I'm in business, guys.
This is what I always wanted!
But, Curtis,
what about the conspiracy?
- What about The Marked?
- You were almost done.
You were just about to
tell us all the names.
The names?
Well, there are no names.
Not really.
I made the whole thing up.
I'm putting that project on the shelf.
I couldn't finish it.
What, they got to you.
they bought you off, huh?
You really believed that stuff,
didn't you?
Look, I'm flattered,
but you need to calm down.
There's no such thing
as The Marked.
Just like Robert Shaftoe
didn't shoot JFK.
They're just movies.
So... I'm sorry I missed my checkups.
It won't happen again.
Can I leave now?
I gotta pack.
I'm going to Hollywood.
There's nothing unusual there.
I spent all afternoon
in NTAC medical,
and as far as they could tell,
there's nothing different with me.
Well, that's good, Tom.
It's all a mind game.
They just want us to back off.
Well, it's not going to work.
We're gonna find out
the truth about these people
with or without Curtis Peck.
Excuse me, agent Baldwin?
agent Skouris?
Sorry for the surprise.
I asked my driver to make a detour.
I can't get that crazy movie
idea out of my head.
What was it called,
The Marked?
You know damn well
what it was called.
I guess I do.
I keep thinking
what it would be like
to actually be
one of those guys.
Imagine if you were
stuck in the past,
just cut off from your friends
and your family.
That'd be quite a sacrifice,
wouldn't it?
They sound kind of like
heroes to me.
Well,
heroes don't have people killed,
They don't consume the personalities
of innocent men and women.
I don't know exactly
what The Marked are up to.
I haven't seen the movie.
You never will now.
No one will.
Maybe it's better that way.
Seems to me their work would be
best done in secret.
If they are out there,
I would think
people like you
would consider them,
I don't know, allies?
After all, they'd have
the same goal as you, right?
To stop Jordan Collier's
global revolution,
and all the chaos
and unrest that it could bring.
I'd just think of them
as back-up.
Valuable back-up.
If...
- they exist.
- That's right.
If they exist.
Anyway, it was good
to see you two again.
I have to pick up my wife.
We're being honored
at the world
health organization tonight.
Those look like x-rays.
is everything okay with you?
It didn't work.
Whatever you tried to do to me,
it didn't take.
I'm still me.
Of course you're you.
We're all ourselves, aren't we?
I mean, who else would we be?
He made you doubt me,
didn't he?
Your cousin,
he made you doubt me.
It's just weird timing,
Hewitt's stroke.
If you have something you want to
ask me, Kyle, I'll answer honestly.
Was this you?
Did you have this done?
I did not.
I believe you.
I'm sorry Shawn didn't.
I'm sorry, too.
Shawn was like a son to me,
and I've lost him.
But I've found you.
Thank you.
Don't thank me, just change.
I think we can rest easy.
It's all going to be fine.
Tell the others that I went to see
the NTAC agents.
Baldwin thinks
it's some kind of ploy,
a mind game...
When we need him,
he will be there for us.

4400 avaient disparu
4400 sont revenus
Tous possèdent une aptitude unique
L'un d'entre eux porte un message
Quiconque peut devenir exceptionnel
Le risque est immense
À la hauteur des bienfaits
C'est irréversible
Le monde devra nous accepter.
<i>Précédemment dans</i> Les 4400...
J'ai pas sommeil.
As-tu peur
de ce dont tu pourrais rêver ?
<i>- Qui est Cassie ?
- Je suis la capacité de Kyle.</i>
<i>Ils m'ont fait quelque chose.</i>
<i>Quand on aura besoin de lui,
il sera là pour nous.</i>
Ils m'ont injecté un truc.
- Où est Kyle ?
- Vous n'êtes pas prêt.
Vous ne comprenez pas
ce que nous faisons ici.
- Alors, quel est cet endroit ?
- Le prototype d'un monde meilleur.
Ils aspirent juste à une vie meilleure,
et ils ont réussi.
<i>La promicine n'est pas
qu'un moyen d'améliorer le monde,</i>
mais elle apportera
le Paradis sur Terre.
Vous avez un rôle à jouer,
et je suis censé vous aider.
Vous allez tous nous guider...
vers Dieu.
- Et maintenant, que fait-on ?
- Nous allons à Seattle.
Tout le monde attend.
Ce sont des gens bien.
Fidèles.
Ils ont foi en ce nouveau monde
que je leur ai promis.
Ce n'est pas qu'une promesse.
Ça va arriver...
et ça commence
dès aujourd'hui.
Si nous franchissons le pas,
plus de retour en arrière possible.
Assure-moi Kyle,
que quoi qu'il en coûte,
quels que soient les sacrifices,
tout ceci en vaudra la peine.
Vous savez que cela
en vaut la peine, Jordan.
C'est le moment idéal,
et c'est l'endroit idéal.
Si vous n'y croyiez pas,
nous ne serions pas à Seattle.
Allons-y, et changeons le monde.
<i>Nous avons foi en vous, Jordan.</i>
<i>Il est là !</i>
Il y a 3 ans,
4400 personnes disparues,
toutes possédant une aptitude unique,
sont réapparues
dans une boule de lumière,
le monde entier s'interrogeait.
Il y a 6 mois,
les doses de promicine
ont rendu ces aptitudes
accessibles à tous ceux
ayant l'audace de les prendre.
Et à nouveau...
le monde entier s'interrogeait.
Aujourd'hui...
nous allons leur expliquer.
Aujourd'hui, nous répondrons
à toutes leurs questions.
Et demain...
le monde
ne sera plus jamais le même.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Je ne sais pas ce que j'ai.
Ces nouilles
étaient vraiment trop cuites.
Diana, arrête de t'excuser.
Depuis des mois, je n'ai mangé
que des plats réchauffés ou à emporter.
Toutes ces années en coéquipiers,
je ne t'ai jamais invité à dîner...
Ça ne t'a jamais autant gêné
auparavant.
Quoi ?
Écoute, quand une femme
invite un homme à dîner,
il ne peut y avoir
que deux raisons...
Le désir...
ou la pitié,
et je parierais sur la pitié.
Avec Alana et Kyle,
tu en as bien bavé récemment.
Moi aussi.
Je me suis dit que rien ne vaut mieux
que des pâtes trop cuites pour...
arranger les choses.
Tu sais, tu auras beau gratter
cette tache,
elle ne disparaîtra pas.
Tu as raison.
C'est juste une tache.
Je n'ai pas changé.
Je ne suis pas un Marqué, ou...
Je n'ai jamais dit ça.
Ce boulot
peut rendre dingue, hein ?
En parlant de boulot,
comment tu trouves Meghan ?
Elle est différente...
de l'idée
qu'on se fait d'un chef.
Tu ne t'avances pas trop.
T'as rien remarqué ?
Je trouve qu'elle fait...
comme une fixation sur toi.
Quoi ?
Une fixation ?
Maman, Jordan Collier...
Il va faire quelque chose.
Quelque chose d'important.
Tu l'as vu ?
Tu as eu une vision ?
Ma puce, où il est ?
Ici, à Seattle.
Kyle est avec lui.
Il est là...

Maia, j'ai scanné ton dessin.
On peut le modifier comme tu veux,
pour se rapprocher de ce que tu as vu.
Le rouge,
un peu plus foncé,
surtout vers le milieu.
Maia, tu es sûre que ça représente
un endroit à Seattle ?
Il y avait...
comme des lignes
dessinées sur l'image.
- Comme ça ?
- C'est clair comme modèle.
Une carte de relief ?
Rouge pour les sommets,
bleu et vert
pour les altitudes basses.
Ou alors la densité de population,
la répartition des foyers
par type de revenu,
par origine,
ou tendance religieuse.
- Ça réduit les possibilités.
- Tout à fait.
Toutes ces études nécessitent
des analyses assez poussées,
- et ce n'est pas donné.
- Donc une grosse société,
ou une étude du gouvernement.
Mais qui ?
La Défense, la N.S.A., le recensement ?
Il y a des chances que l'image
provienne d'un de leurs ordinateurs,
donc, je dois pouvoir la trouver.
Kara...
Tu peux rester.
Je ne voudrais pas abuser
de ton hospitalité.
Écoute, j'espère
que tu ne m'en veux pas.
Je n'avais pas prévu...
Plus qu'un repas et un ciné ?
C'est que, ces derniers jours
ont été excellents,
mais ta mère est une cliente,
ou plutôt, elle l'était.
Tu parles
comme si tu étais son avocat.
Ma mère avait
une leucémie de stade IV.
Tu lui as sauvé la vie.
Je ne voudrais pas que tu penses
que j'ai pour habitude
de coucher
avec les gens que j'aide.
Je le sais.
J'adorerais rester.
Mais j'ai un rendez-vous
- tôt demain matin.
- D'accord.
Je t'appelle.
Je pense que
ça répond à ma question.
J'allais demander
si vous étiez sûr de vouloir
participer à cette opération.
Croyez-moi, personne ne veut
arrêter Collier plus que moi.
Je ne pensais pas à Collier.
Mais à votre fils.
Tout ce qu'on peut lui reprocher,
c'est d'avoir pris de la promicine.
Je peux lui proposer un marché,
le mettre sous inhibiteur.
Mais plus il restera avec Collier,
moins je pourrai l'aider.
Êtes-vous sûr qu'il...
veut qu'on l'aide ?
C'est mon fils, je dois pouvoir
lui faire entendre raison.
Je suis désolée.
Je comprends.
C'est une étude de l'Agence
de Protection de l'Environnement.
Les zones rouges indiquent
un niveau élevé de pollution,
rose, un peu moins, etc...
jusqu'au vert.
Marco, tu sais où est Collier ?
Le delta Duwamish,
au sud de Seattle.
Un des endroits
les plus pollués du pays.
Anciennes raffineries,
routes sans issue, usines à l'abandon...
Pas vraiment sympa
comme endroit.
Sauf pour se cacher,
c'est idéal.
Un vrai labyrinthe, ça prendrait
des jours pour tout fouiller.
Alors, commencez tout de suite,
parce que d'après Maia,
peu importe ce que prépare Collier,
ça commencera ici.
Bobby, prends par là.
Nous, on couvre de ce côté.
J'arrive pas à comprendre pourquoi
Collier se risque à revenir à Seattle.
Comme s'il nous lançait un défi.
Sans Maia,
on n’aurait pas retrouvé sa trace.
Il ne s'est pas montré en public.
En venant ici,
il veut se faire discret.
Je ne trouve pas ça
trop discret.
J'en connais un
qui n'a peur de rien.
Tom, c'est quoi, ces lumières ?
On dirait
qu'ils ont marqué leur territoire.
Sans doute pour avertir
qu'il y a un système d'alarme.
J'appelle des renforts.
Ici, Skouris.
<i>Envoyez des renforts au...</i>
Tom, que se passe-t-il ?
Recule !
On ne recommencera pas.
Le Sénateur Lenhoff est ici.
Sénateur, j'ignorais
que vous étiez en ville.
Vous êtes venu saluer
votre candidat favori ?
En fait, je suis venu
vous gâcher votre matinée.
"Du sexe contre des miracles" ?
C'est partout sur le Net.
Tous les anti-4400
se sont rués dessus.
Ils disent que j'ai forcé Kara
à coucher avec moi
- pour avoir guéri sa mère.
- Vous la connaissez ?
Je ne me fais pas payer de cette façon,
ni d'aucune autre façon d'ailleurs.
Mais vous avez couché ?
Elle m'a invité à dîner.
On est sortis ensemble.
On a passé un bon moment,
et on s'est revus.
- Je l'aime bien.
- Farrell, avez-vous couché
oui ou non, avec cette femme ?
- La nuit dernière.
- Et c'est sur le Net, ce matin.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Vous pensez qu'on m'a piégé ?
Mes hommes vont creuser un peu.
Ça devrait être assez facile
de discréditer une fille comme elle...
- il y a toujours un truc.
- Sénateur...
Évitons de s'attaquer à elle
tant que je ne lui ai pas parlé.
Vous voulez la ménager,
allez-y...
Mais si elle est ce que je pense,
demain,
il faudra changer de tactique.
Ces lumières, ou...
ces balises, peu importe,
elles ont dû être créées
par un de ses adeptes.
Elles s'étendent de là,
jusqu'à la rivière.
Ils ont isolé
presque 260 ha de bâtiments,
à l'endroit le plus pollué du delta.
Avec la police
et la Garde Nationale,
personne n'entre ni ne sort
sans qu'on le sache.
Donc, Collier est acculé.
Il suffit de trouver un moyen
de franchir ces lumières.
Vous feriez bien
de venir voir ça...
<i>Depuis trop longtemps,</i>
<i>ceux d'entre nous
qui possèdent des dons,</i>
<i>les 4400 et ceux
qui ont pris de la promicine,</i>
<i>ont dû dissimuler
voire jusqu'à délaisser leurs aptitudes.</i>
<i>Je suis ici pour vous annoncer
que le temps où vous vous cachiez</i>
<i>est révolu.</i>
Et que le temps des miracles...
est arrivé.
Tout commence... ici.
<i>Aujourd'hui, nous revendiquons...</i>
<i>l'occupation
de cette misérable parcelle de terrain.</i>
Il vient de dire qu'il annexait
une partie de Seattle ?
- On dirait bien.
- <i>... pour la faire revivre.</i>
<i>Grâce à nos aptitudes,</i>
<i>nous allons guérir
ce sol toxique.</i>
Nous allons purifier
ces eaux polluées,
et nous transformerons
cet endroit dévasté
en jardin luxuriant.
<i>À ceux qui désirent
nous rejoindre,</i>
<i>vous êtes les bienvenus.</i>
<i>Il vous suffit
de posséder une aptitude,</i>
<i>et la volonté
de participer à ce miracle.</i>
<i>Mais,
les bienfaits que nous apporterons,</i>
<i>ne se limiteront pas
à cette petite enclave,</i>
<i>car ce n'est que le début...</i>
<i>d'une plus vaste</i>
<i>et profonde guérison.</i>
Car le miracle
que nous réaliserons ici,
nous avons l'intention
de le généraliser.
<i>Aidez-nous,</i>
<i>rejoignez-nous, et ensemble,</i>
<i>nous pourrons transformer
ce monde en un paradis.</i>
Ouais, en admettant de survivre
à la promicine.
<i>Quant à ceux
qui ne nous rejoindront pas,</i>
nous vous demandons simplement
de nous laisser en paix.</i>
Si vous continuez
à vous interposer,
si vous nous menacez,
ou si vous nous attaquez,
<i>il faudra en subir
les conséquences,</i>
<i>immédiates,</i>
<i>et violentes.</i>
<i>Je ne suis pas venu
vous intimider.</i>
<i>Je vous apporte
un message d'espoir,</i>
<i>pour de meilleurs lendemains,</i>
<i>dans un monde nouveau.</i>
<i>Tout se joue ici,</i>
<i>dans cette...</i>
cité de l'espoir.
Tout partira d'ici,
<i>dans cette Ville Promise.</i>
Je n'aimerais pas
avoir sa place,
Collier annexe
une partie de Seattle
pour en faire son fief,
et ça, sous ses yeux.
Elle va pas marquer des points
à Washington...
- Personne n'a rien vu venir.
- Tom, encore une autre.
Un séisme dans les monts Allegheny,
pas loin de Pittsburgh.
5,2 sur l'échelle de Richter.
À des kilomètres de toute faille.
Une tornade
près de Palm Springs,
un entrepôt qui explose à Jersey,
un tsunami sur le lac Michigan,
puis ça... Des blessés ?
Non, comme les autres :
beaucoup de dégâts, mais pas de blessés.
Mais, plus près de la ville,
cela aurait été différent.
Collier a déclaré sur le Net
qu'il revendiquait la responsabilité
de tous ces désastres.
Il appelle ça des démonstrations.
Pour qu'on sache ce qu'il se passera
si on s'en prend à lui.
Dieu sait combien de personnes
ayant des capacités sont avec lui,
dispersés dans le pays,
attendant juste un signal.
<i>Salut, papa.</i>
Salut, Kyle.
- Tu vas bien ?
- <i>Ouais, ça va bien.</i>
Bon, alors écoute,
voilà ce que tu vas faire...
Tu te diriges vers le périmètre,
tu le traverses,
et tu te rends
au premier agent du NTAC que tu verras.
Papa, je dois rester ici.
Les choses pourraient
mal tourner là-bas.
<i>Assure-toi
que ça n'arrive pas.</i>
La Ville Promise doit tenir
ses promesses, tout en dépend.
C'est ce que te raconte
Jordan Collier ?
En fait,
c'est ce que <i>je</i> lui raconte.
Tu es devenu son conseiller,
maintenant ?
Quelque chose comme ça.
Alors, conseille-lui
d'arrêter ça tout de suite !
Je peux pas, OK ?
Je sais que ça semble rapide,
mais tu dois m'écouter.
<i>Il y a ce livre, une sorte de prophétie,</i>
<i>ma capacité
m'a conduit jusqu'à lui.</i>
<i>Cette capacité, tu ne m'as
toujours pas dit ce que c'était.</i>
C'est compliqué.
Elle me dit ce que je dois faire.
Elle...
Ce qui est important,
et ce livre est important, papa.
Tu vois...
Ce livre a presque 100 ans,
mais il parle des 4400,
de la promicine,
de tout, et...
Papa, il explique
ce qui doit se passer
<i>pour créer
le Paradis sur Terre,</i>
<i>et tout commence
dans la Ville Promise.</i>
<i>En voyant ce qu'on peut faire ici,
tout le monde nous rejoindra.</i>
Et après, quand tout le monde
aura pris de la promicine...
Je ne vois pas
comment le dire autrement...
Dieu nous apparaîtra.
Ce sera le paradis sur Terre.
Tu es toujours là ?
Ouais, je suis là.
Attends...
Kyle, réfléchis
à ce que tu dis.
Si tout le monde
prend une dose,
la moitié d'entre eux
vont mourir.
<i>Tu parles du Paradis
au prix d'un génocide.</i>
Papa, le monde entier
est en train de sombrer.
<i>La Ville Promise
doit être un succès.</i>
<i>Empêche-les de la détruire.</i>
Écoute, Kyle...
on ne pourrait pas...
se voir pour en parler ?
Viens à la maison.
Ma maison est ici, papa.
On en reparlera bientôt.
Je te croyais
plus intelligent que ça.
Tu es vraiment
si surpris que ça ?
- J'ai sauvé la vie de ta mère...
- Et je t'en suis reconnaissante.
Ma mère était malade
depuis 3 ans.
Mes parents ont dépensé
toutes leurs économies.
Ils ont payé
pour rembourser leurs dettes,
- et m'offrir une nouvelle vie.
- "Ils" ? Qui, "ils" ?
Des avocats.
De l'Est, je crois.
Ils avaient promis de s'occuper de moi,
et ils ont tenu parole.
Tu m'as trahi pour de l'argent.
Les gens ont besoin de toi,
et de ton don de guérison.
Peu importe si t'es élu ou pas.
Tu crois que le fait que je sois un 4400
excuse ce que tu as fait ?
Je devais me protéger.
Je suis pas spéciale
comme toi.
Je devais me protéger,
et c'est ce que j'ai fait.
Il avait l'air sensé,
mais ce qu'il disait, enfin...
Le Paradis sur Terre,
l'apparition de Dieu ?
J'aimerais voir ce fameux livre
et lire la prophétie.
Et après ?
Tu prends une dose
en espérant survivre,
et tu rejoins Collier
au Paradis ?
Où est passée Diana Skouris,
la sceptique de service ?
Tu sais, Tom,
ma fille a des visions du futur.
Il faut envisager la possibilité
qu'il y ait un rapport avec ce livre.
C'est tout.
Mais, qu'est-ce que...
C'est ça,
la solution de Washington ?
Envoyer un commando
pour déloger Jordan Collier ?
Sauf votre respect, Madame,
ce n'est pas un commando.
Mais arrêter les gens,
c'est pas votre truc, si ?
Jordan collier s'est insurgé
ouvertement contre le gouvernement.
Il s'est emparé d'un territoire,
et s'est déclaré
au-dessus de la loi.
Que voulez-vous que l'on fasse ?
Lui moucher le nez et lui lire
une histoire pour s'endormir ?
C'est ça, l'alternative ?
Une histoire pour dormir,
ou une balle dans la tête ?
On m'a ordonné d'envoyer mes hommes,
et c'est ce que je vais faire.
Qui vous dit que
vous réussirez à l'approcher ?
Pas de souci de côté-là, Madame.
Je crois
que nous sommes bien équipés.
Le programme de soldats améliorés.
C'est toujours d'actualité ?
Le ministère de la Défense
en a fait sa priorité nº 1.
Maia, comment ça,
je dois sauver Jordan Collier ?
<i>Les soldats. Ils vont le tuer.
Je l'ai vu.</i>
Après quoi,
une chose horrible va se produire.
Horrible ?
Maia, qu'est-ce que tu as vu ?
C'était tout noir.
Quoi, à la fin de la vision ?
<i>Non, c'était toujours pendant,</i>
mais c'était comme si,
je n'y étais plus.
Il n'y avait plus personne.
<i>Je t'en prie, maman,
tu dois sauver Jordan Collier.</i>
Je ferai mon possible.
<i>C'est promis.</i>
J'en suis sûre.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, par ici ?
D'après Cassie,
je dois attendre ici,
donc, j'attends.
Je me disais, tu pourrais
peut-être lui demander...
quel est mon vrai rôle
dans tout ça ?
Tu as un rôle.
Ça, j'en suis sûr.
C'est elle qui te l'a dit ?
Elle me dit
ce que bon lui semble.
Et tu obéis à ce qu'elle dit ?
Ça te dérange pas ?
Ça doit juste être
une question de foi.
Un des principes mêmes
de cette Ville Promise.
La foi.
La croyance.
L'espoir.
<i>Reviens ici, toi !</i>
Kyle, il y a quelque chose.
Une personne a réussi à entrer
en passant les barrières de police.
Ça provient
d'une des voitures de police.
Mon Dieu !
Maia ?
Pourquoi tu ne réponds pas ?
Tu me rappelles
dès que tu as ce message !
- Elle doit pas avoir son téléphone.
- Ou ils le lui ont pris.
Jordan ne lui fera pas de mal,
Diana.
Maia est allée le prévenir
pour les soldats.
Il rêverait
de contrôler sa capacité.
Il va sûrement la recevoir
comme une reine.
C'est la première fois que
la vision de Maia finit sur du noir.
On doit y aller
et mettre Kyle et Maia en lieu sûr.
Et comment on franchit
les balises ?
Aquino et ses hommes
ont l'être d'être sûrs
de pouvoir passer.
On les accompagne.
C'est une opération militaire.
Lawton n'acceptera pas
que 2 agents du NTAC les accompagnent.
On y va sans autorisation, alors.
Je suis née il y a 3 ans.
Donc, quoi,
t'as neuf ans de plus que moi ?
Presque 10.
Je suis devenue adulte
en l'espace d'une nuit...
je n'ai pas compris
ce que ça impliquait.
Tu as fait beaucoup de mal.
On m'a dit
qu'elles étaient indispensables.
Importantes.
Mais, ça n'excuse rien, hein ?
Non. En effet.
Ce qui je veux te dire, c'est que
je suis désolée de t'avoir fait peur,
et pour avoir fait du mal
aux gens que tu aimes.
Des fois, le mal est si grand...
que s'excuser ne suffit pas.
Je sais.
Maia Skouris.
Bienvenue dans la Ville Promise.
J'ai cru comprendre
que tu avais à me parler.
Je veux vous poser une question.
Faites-vous partie des gentils
ou des méchants ?
Ma mère n'arrive pas à se décider.
J'avais remarqué.
Je vais te dire...
Je veux te montrer quelque chose.
Tu pourras
alors te faire ta propre idée.
<i>Hier, je vous ai promis
des miracles.</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui,
je vais vous faire une démonstration.</i>
Voici le delta Duwamish.
Un des cours d'eau
les plus pollués
de tout le pays.
Il est saturé
de produits cancérigènes,
de PCB, et un niveau
de mercure très toxique.
<i>C'est une calamité.</i>
<i>Anastasia ?</i>
<i>Anastasia a pris de la promicine</i>
<i>après la mort de son fiancé
dans un accident de voiture.</i>
<i>Vous conviendrez,
j'en suis sûr,</i>
<i>qu'elle a développé
une aptitude remarquable.</i>
Voilà à quoi
devrait ressembler une rivière.
<i>Et voilà le goût
que son eau devrait avoir.</i>
<i>Venez. L'eau est pure.</i>
Alors, Maia,
tu penses que je suis un gentil
ou un méchant ?
Des soldats...
avec des aptitudes.
Ils ne vont pas tarder.
Ils viennent vous tuer.
Bien que j'ai envie de dire
"Je vous l'avais dit",
ça ne va rien changer aux faits.
Vous avez dit
qu'on pouvait faire avec.
La partie de jambe en l'air, oui,
mais Jordan Collier ?
Cette histoire de Ville Promise ?
On n'est pas de taille.
J'ai déjà fait connaître
mon avis concernant Jordan.
Je l'ai condamné en public
pour avoir distribué la promicine.
Votre campagne tourne
autour d'un concept...
Oui, une voie modérée
entre 4400 et non-4400,
que vous m'avez proposée,
et ce en quoi je crois.
Il n'y a plus de voie modérée,
à présent.
Collier vient
de tout faire tomber à l'eau.
La Ville Promise.
Des miracles.
On n'est pas capables de rivaliser.
Donc, c'est la fin ?
Vous voulez que j'abandonne ?
Je vous dis
que vous ne gagnerez pas.
Henders, c'est à toi.
Il se trouve à l'est d'ici.
Environ à dix blocs.
Ces types ont tous les bons trucs.
Encore heureux qu'Aquino ne peut
se camoufler qu'en étant immobile.
On les aurait perdus
une fois arrivés ici.
Diana, ralentis.
On va se faire repérer.
- Je veux pas les perdre.
- Qu'est-ce que vous fabriquez ?
Capitaine, on veut pas s'interposer
dans votre mission, OK ?
Ma fille est dans la Ville Promise.
Je veux la faire sortir, c'est tout.
Si vous vous faites prendre,
ça compliquera notre mission.
Rendez les armes, je vous attache,
et on viendra vous chercher en partant.
Ça se voit que
vous n'avez pas d'enfants.
J'ai dit rendez les armes !
Diana, cours !
D'accord, c'est pas bon signe.
Je sais que t'es là.
Tu peux pas bouger
quand t'es camouflé.
Alors, je me camoufle pas.
Vous m'avez fait peur.
10 h dans le parc public.
D'accord, ça marche, merci.
Maintenant,
on prépare votre discours de retrait.
Le plus important,
c'est de sortir par la grande porte.
Shawn,
il y a des journalistes en bas.
Dites-leur que la conférence de presse
est reportée à demain.
J'y vais maintenant.
J'ai des choses à dire.
M. Farrell !
Quels sont vos liens
avec Kara Sarkestian ?
Vous avez guéri sa mère
en échange...
Êtes-vous en relation
avec Jordan Collier ?
Du calme. S'il vous plaît.
Avant tout,
malgré mon don de guérison,
je suis comme tout le monde,
il m'arrive donc
de faire des erreurs.
Cette nuit-là était une erreur.
Je regrette
que mon erreur de jugement
nous éloigne des vrais problèmes
développés dans ma campagne.
En ce moment,
Jordan Collier est en train de créer
sa propre civilisation, dans un endroit
qu'il appelle Ville Promise,
creusant un peu plus le fossé
séparant les personnes
ayant des aptitudes et les autres.
Il dit qu'il est ici
pour guérir le monde,
mais ce qu'il fait,
risque de tout détruire.
C'est pourquoi
je n'ai pas d'autre choix
que de continuer ma campagne,
pour continuer à défendre
l'unité et la coopération,
et pour offrir une alternative
dont nous pourrons tous profiter.
- Je répondrai à vos questions.
- M. Farell...
Sénateur Lenhoff,
soutenez-vous encore M. Farell ?
Plus que jamais.
Shawn, une autre déclaration ?
Salut, maman.
Oh, Maia,
j'étais morte d'inquiétude.
Je suis désolée.
Je devais avertir Jordan.
Jordan ?
C'est Jordan, maintenant ?
Cet endroit, maman,
ils font plein de choses géniales.
Tu devrais voir ça.
Une autre fois.
On s'en va.
- Maintenant.
- Non.
Non ?
Comment ça, "non" ?
On ne peut pas.
On doit rester ici.
C'est plus sûr.
Mauvaise journée, hein, papa ?
J'ai connu mieux.
Tu comptes me détacher ?
Et maintenant ?
On va voir Jordan.
Messieurs,
vous êtes sur une propriété privée.
Vous êtes certain
de ne pas vouloir changer d'avis ?
Vous pourriez nous rejoindre,
conserver votre aptitude.
Jamais.
J'imagine bien.
Quelle tristesse de voir gâcher
des dons comme les vôtres !
Fais-les reconduire
hors de la Ville Promise.
Collier, attendez.
Ce n'est pas fini.
Cet endroit est une cible à éliminer.
Le gouvernement
ne s'arrêtera pas là.
Alors, je leur montrerai que
c'est vraiment une mauvaise idée.
Attendez... attendez !
Vous avez dû mal comprendre.
Vous pouvez partir.
Maia, tu peux revenir quand tu veux.
Même rester ici quelques jours
avec l'autorisation de ta mère.
Séjourner en pleine zone de guerre ?
Je crois pas, non.
Ils n'auraient pas dû
envoyer ces soldats,
mais n'aggravez pas les choses
en ripostant.
Vos supérieurs ont un problème.
Qu'ils nous laissent en paix !
Votre fils a raison.
Vous avez promis des miracles,
vous en avez même montré un.
Mais dès que des gens mourront,
ce sera fini.
Quand des gens meurent,
c'est la guerre qui est déclarée.
Même si vous pensez être de taille,
quand c'est la guerre,
tout le monde est perdant.
N'en soyez pas si sûre.
Ma maman a raison.
Si une guerre se déclenche,
tout le monde est perdant.
Tu l'as vu ?
À l'instant,
pendant que vous parliez.
Je vous en supplie,
écoutez ma mère.
Alors, Kyle ?
Maia a réussi à convaincre Collier ?
Il ne tentera pas
de représailles ?
Il va faire
ce qu'il croit être bien,
mais il ne fera de mal à personne,
sauf s'il y est forcé.
Vous savez par où est la sortie.
J'éteindrai les balises
pour que vous passiez.
Kyle, viens avec moi.
C'est peut-être ta dernière chance.
Tu renonces jamais, hein ?
Non, et je continuerai.
Le livre dont je t'ai parlé ?
La prophétie ?
Le Paradis sur Terre ?
Oui, je me souviens.
Une liste de 200 noms
figure dans le livre.
Des gens qui peuvent prendre une dose
avec la garantie de survivre.
Le dernier nom de la liste,
c'est le tien, papa.
Tu veux dire quoi par là, Kyle ?
Que je dois prendre de la promicine,
car c'est écrit dans un livre ?
Simplement que
tu es une personne très importante.
Et pas seulement à mes yeux.
Je dois filer.
Je ne sais pas pour toi,
mais je suis crevée.
Ouais, moi aussi.
Cette guerre,
celle dont tu as parlé à Collier,
tu as vu quoi, au juste ?
En fait...
j'ai rien vu.
Ma puce,
même si c'est très grave,
dis-le-moi, je dois savoir.
Non, mais maman...
J'ai vraiment rien vu.
J'ai pas eu de vision.
J'ai menti.
Pourquoi ?
Je ne voulais pas que
Jordan fasse du mal aux gens,
et il ne voulait pas t'écouter.
Tu étais sûre qu'il t'écouterait ?
J'espérais.
Et j'espère qu'il t'a crue, aussi.
Tu sais, maman,
Jordan n'est pas
quelqu'un de mauvais.
Je crois...
qu'il fait partie des gentils.
Si lui, c'est un gentil,
alors moi, je suis quoi ?
Skouris.
J'arrive.
Ils se tiennent là depuis quand ?
Ils ont commencé à se réunir
il y a 20 minutes.
Voilà Collier...
Et il y a aussi Kyle.
Et Isabelle Tyler.
Je croyais qu'on pouvait pas
approcher les balises ?
Quelqu'un doit les protéger.
Ils déplacent le périmètre.
C'est ça,
les représailles de Collier.
Il étend la Ville Promise.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
Plus on tentera de s'opposer à lui,
plus il occupera de terrain.
Aujourd'hui c'est le sud de Seattle,
demain ce sera quoi, le monde ?
C'est deux fois plus grand qu'avant.

<i>v1.00</i>
The world will have to
deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...
I'm not tired.
Are you worried about
what you might dream?
<i>- Who's cassie?
- I'm Kyle's ability.
<i>They did something to me
last night.
<i>When we need him,
he'll be there for us.
They put something into me.
- Where's kyle?
- Kyle and I agree. You're not ready.
You don't understand what we're trying
to accomplish here.
- Then tell me, what is this place?
- It's a model for a better world.
They're looking to make a better
life for themselves, and they did.
<i>Promicin isn't just here
to improve the world.
It's here to bring
heaven to earth.
You're supposed to make it happen,
and I'm supposed to help you.
You are going to
lead us all to God.
- So, what do we do now?
- We're going to Seattle.
Everyone's waiting.
These are
good people.
Loyal.
They believe in this new world
I've promised them.
It's not just a promise.
It's going to happen...
starting today.
Once we take this step,
there is no going back.
I need you to tell me, Kyle,
that no matter the cost,
no matter the sacrifice,
this will all be worth it.
You know
it's worth it, Jordan.
This is the right time.
This is the right place.
If you didn't believe that,
we wouldn't be in Seattle.
Let's go change the world.
<i>We believe in you, Jordan.
<i>He's here!
Three years ago,
4400 missing people,
each with
an extraordinary ability,
reappeared in a ball of light,
and the world wondered why.
Six months ago,
the promicin shot
made those abilities
accessible to anyone
with the courage to take it.
And again...
the world wondered why.
Today...
we tell them why.
Today,
we answer all the questions.
And after today...
the world
will never be the same.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know
what's wrong with me.
Those noodles were so
overcooked.
Diana,
stop apologizing.
That's the first meal
I've had in months
that didn't come out of a microwave
or a take-out carton.
All these years
we've been partners, and I...
haven't had you over for dinner...
You never felt
this sorry for me before.
What?
Look, when a woman
invites a man over for dinner,
it's for one of two reasons...
Attraction...
or pity,
and I'm putting my money on pity.
Between Alana and Kyle,
you have had
a tough run of it lately.
Me too.
I figured there's nothing like
overcooked pasta to...
start the healing process.
You know, no matter how hard
you rub that mole,
it's not going to go away.
You're right.
It's just a mole.
I mean, I'm still me.
I'm not one of the marked, or whatever.
No, I never said you were.
This job can mess
with your head, huh?
Speaking of work,
what do you think of Meghan?
She's different...
from what you'd expect
for a boss.
That's a little noncommittal.
Have you not noticed?
I think she's a little...
a little focused on you.
What?
Focused on me?
Mom, Jordan Collier...
He's about to
do something.
Something big.
You saw him?
Did you have a vision?
Sweetie,
where is he?
He's here, in Seattle.
Kyle's with him.
He's right here.

Maia, I've imported your drawing
into a graphics file.
We can make any changes you want,
to get it closer to what you saw.
The reds,
they should be a little darker,
especially around the middle.
Maia, are you sure this represents
some part of Seattle?
The picture had...
some kind of lines
under the colors.
- Like that?
- There's a definite pattern here.
Maybe it's an elevation study?
Red for peaks,
blue and green
for lower elevations.
It could be a population survey,
a study of homes
of median income.
ethnic,
religious groupings.
- That narrows it down.
- Actually, it does.
All those things require
comprehensive data analyses,
- and those don't come cheap.
- Which means a big corporate
or a government study.
Yeah, what?
D.O.D., N.S.A., census bureau.
Odds are, this image is sitting
in a government computer somewhere,
which means I can find it.
Kara...
You don't
have to leave.
I didn't want to
overstay my welcome.
Listen, I hope you're
okay with everything.
I didn't really
plan on...
More than dinner
and a movie?
It's just, these last few days
have been great,
but your mom is a client,
or she was a client.
You make it sound like
you were her lawyer.
My mother had
stage four leukemia.
You saved her life.
I just don't want you to think
that I make a habit
out of sleeping with
the people that I help.
I know that.
I'd love I could stay.
I just have this appointment
- first thing in the morning.
- All right.
I'll call you.
I guess that answers
my question.
I was gonna ask you
if you were sure you wanted
to be a part of this operation.
Believe me, I want Collier
caught as much as anyone.
It's not Collier
I was thinking about.
It's your son.
Look, the only thing we have
on Kyle is taking promicin.
I can still help him cut a deal,
get him on the inhibitor.
But the longer he's with collier,
the harder it's gonna be for me
to help him.
Are you sure he...
wants to be helped?
He's my son, I've got to believe
I can still reach him.
I'm sorry.
I know.
It's a toxicology study.
I got it from the E.P.A.
The red areas indicate
a high level of pollution,
pink a little less, then
all the way to green...
Marco, do you know
where Collier is?
The Duwamish river delta.
South seattle.
One of the most polluted places
in the country.
We're talking old refineries,
dead end streets, and rotting factories.
So, not a nice place.
Unless you wanna hide,
then it's perfect.
That place is a maze. It could take days
to do a complete search.
Then you better get started, because
according to what Maia's told us,
whatever Jordan Collier's planning,
this is ground zero.
Bobby, head that way.
We're going to cover this side.
I still don't understand why Collier
would risk coming back to Seattle.
It's like he's daring us
to catch him.
We wouldn't even know he was here
if it weren't for Maia.
It's not like he's showed
up at a Mariners game.
This place is pretty
low profile.
I don't think this qualifies
as low profile.
Somebody's feeling
pretty confident.
Tom, what are those lights?
It's almost like they're marking
some kind of perimeter.
Maybe they're warning lights,
an alarm system.
I'm calling for back-up.
This is Skouris.
<i>We need help down at Duwamish delta.
Tom, what?
Get back!
We won't be doing that again.
Senator Lenhoff is here.
Senator, I didn't know
you were in town.
Come to say hello to your
favorite future councilman?
Actually, I'm here
to ruin your morning.
"Sex for miracles"?
It's all over the net.
Every anti-4400 wingnut
is running with it.
This says that I forced Kara
to have sex with me,
- in exchange for healing her mother.
- You know this girl?
I didn't exchange sex for miracles,
or for anything else, for that matter.
But you slept with her?
She asked me out to dinner.
We went out on a date.
We had a really good time.
We went on a couple more dates.
- I like this girl.
- Farrell, did you or did you not
have sex with this woman?
- Last night.
- And it hits the net this morning.
What does that tell you?
You think this is
some kind of set-up?
I'll have my people
start digging.
It should be easy enough
to discredit her. A girl like this,
- there's always something.
- Senator...
Let's hold off on the character
assassination until I talk to kara.
You want to play nice,
give it a try.
But if this girl's
who I think she is,
tomorrow we come out swinging.
These lights, or...
beacons or whatever,
they must've been built
by one of Jordan's followers.
They extend from here,
all the way to the river.
They wall off about
a square mile of buildings
right in the most toxic
part of the delta.
We called in Seattle P.D.
and the guard.
No one's getting in or out
without us knowing it.
So Collier's backed
himself into a corner.
All we have to do is figure out
a way to get past these lights.
I think you're going to
want to see this.
<i>For too long,
<i>those of us with special gifts,
<i>the 4400,
and those who've taken promicin,
<i>have had to conceal
and even neglect their abilities.
<i>Well, I stand before you today
to tell you the time for hiding...
<i>is over.
And that the time for miracles...
has begun.
And it starts right here.
<i>Today, we claim...
<i>this godforsaken piece of earth...
ours.
Did this guy just say
he's annexing part of Seattle?
- It sounded like that.
- <i>...to make it whole again.
<i>Using our abilities,
<i>we will heal its toxic soil.
We will cleanse
its polluted waters,
and we will turn this...
blighted place
into a garden.
<i>For those willing to join us,
<i>we welcome you.
<i>All you need is an ability,
<i>and the willingness to become
part of a miracle.
<i>But, the blessings we bring
<i>will not just be limited to this...
small place,
<i>because this is the beginning</i>
<i>of a much wider...
<i>and deeper healing.
Because the miracles
we work here,
we intend to work everywhere.
<i>Help us,
<i>work with us,
and together,
<i>we can transform this world
into a paradise.
Yeah, assuming
you take promicin and survive.
<i>For those of you
unwilling to join us,
all we ask
is that you leave us in peace.
If you insist on interfering,
if you threaten us,
or in any way attack us,
<i>there will be consequences,
<i>immediate...
<i>and severe.
<i>But I did not come
to intimidate.
<i>This is a message of hope,
<i>for a better tomorrow,
<i>for a new world,
<i>and it begins here,
<i>in this...</i>
city of hope.
It starts here,
<i>in Promise City.
I'd hate to have her job.
Jordan Collier grabs
a chunk of seattle
as his own personal fiefdom
under her watch.
Not going to earn her any
brownie points in D.C.
- No one could have seen that coming.
- Tom, we've got another.
It's an earthquake in the Allegheny
mountains, just outside of Pittsburgh.
5.2 on the Richter scale.
Miles from the nearest
fault line.
A tornado
outside Palm Springs,
a warehouse explosion
in Jersey,
a tsunami on lake Michigan.
Now this? Anyone hurt?
No, just like the others,
property damage, but no injuries.
Any closer to the city, though,
it would have been different.
Collier's made a statement on the net.
He's claiming responsibility
for all these mini-disasters.
He's calling them demonstrations.
Just letting us know what will happen
if we move against him.
I mean, God knows how many
people he has with abilities,
scattered around the country
just waiting for his signal.
<i>Hey, dad.
Hey, Kyle.
- You okay?
- <i>Yeah, I'm fine.
All right, good.
Now, here's what I want you to do.
You go to the perimeter,
you walk across,
and you surrender to
the first NTAC agent you see.
Dad, I'm where I need to be.
Things could get
really ugly down there.
<i>Make sure that doesn't happen.
Promise City has to succeed.
Everything depends on it.
Is that what Jordan Collier's
been telling you?
Actually,
that's what I'm telling him.
You're some kind of
advisor to him now?
Something like that.
Then advise him
to end this thing right now!
I can't do that, okay? I know
this is coming at you really fast,
but you got to hear me out.
<i>There's this book. It's a prophecy.
<i>This ability that I have
led me to it.
<i>This ability of yours,
you still haven't  told me what it is.
It's complicated.
It tells me what to do.
It...
What's important,
and this book is important, dad.
I mean...
It's almost 100 years old,
but it talks about the 4400,
promicin, everything, and...
Dad, it explains
what needs to happen
<i>for paradise</i>
<i>to come to earth,</i>
<i>and Promise City's
where it all starts.
<i>once people see what we can do here,
they're gonna want to be a part of it.
<i>Once that happens, according to the book
once everyone's taken promicin...
I don't know
how else to say it.
God is going to show his face.
It'll be heaven on earth.
Are you still there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Wait...
Kyle, think about
what you're saying.
If everyone in the world
takes this shot,
half of them are going to die.
<i>You're talking paradise
at the cost of genocide.
Dad, the world is falling apart.
<i>Okay, Promise City
has to succeed.
<i>You can't let them
destroy it.
Listen, Kyle, just...
can we just...
can we talk in person?
I mean, come home.
I am home, dad.
I'll talk to you soon.
Shawn, I thought
you were smarter than this.
I mean, are you really
that surprised?
I saved
your mother's life...
And I will always
be grateful for that.
My mother was sick
for three years.
My parents went through
their entire life savings.
They gave me enough money
to get my parents out of debt
- and start a life for myself, too.
- They? Who's they?
Lawyers.
From back east, I think.
All I know is that they promised
to take care of me, and they delivered.
You sold me out for money.
People need you.
They need what you can do.
It doesn't really matter
if you get elected or not.
You saying that because I'm a 4400,
what you did is okay.
I had to look out for myself.
I'm not special like you.
I had to look out for myself,
so I did.
He sounded rational,
but the things that were
coming out of his mouth...
Heaven on earth,
the face of God?
I'd like to see this book he's talking
about. Just read the prophecy.
And then what?
You know, take the shot
and hope you survive,
and then join Collier
in paradise?
Come on, what happened to
Diana Skouris, professional skeptic?
Well, you know, Tom,
my daughter sees the future.
We just have to consider the possibility
that there could be something to this.
That's all.
What the hell?
So this is D.C.'s big plan?
Send in a hit squad
to take out Jordan Collier?
With all due respect, Ma'am,
we're not a hit squad.
But you're not exactly trained
to arrest people, are you?
Jordan collier is in open rebellion
against the government.
He seized U.S. territory,
declared himself
above the law.
What do you suggest we do,
wipe his nose
and read him a bedtime story?
Those are our options?
A bedtime story
or a bullet to the head?
I was told to send in my guys,
and that's what I'm gonna do.
What makes you think
you could even get close to him?
We appreciate the concern, Ma'am...
but I think we can handle things.
The enhanced soldier program.
That's still in operation?
The department of defense
considers it a top priority.
Maia, what do you mean,
I have to save Jordan Collier?
<i>The soldiers. They're going
to kill him. I saw it.</i>
And when they do,
something terrible's going to happen.
Terrible?
Maia, what did you see?
It was just... black.
What, you mean the vision ended?
<i>No,
I was still having the vision,</i>
but it was like
I wasn't there anymore.
No one was.
<i>Please, mom,
you can't let Jordan Collier die.</i>
Maia, I'll do what I can.
<i>I promise.</i>
I know you will.
What are you doing out here?
Cassie said
I needed to wait here,
so I'm waiting.
I was thinking
maybe you could ask Cassie
what my role is in all this?
You're part of it.
I know that much.
She told you that?
She tells me what she wants
to tell me.
And you just do what she says?
Does that bother you?
I guess it's just
a matter of faith, you know.
That's what Promise City
is all about.
Faith.
Belief. Hope.
<i>Hey, get back here!</i>
Kyle, I think
something's happening.
We got a report that someone
managed to get past police lines
and enter Promise City. One of the
dashboard cameras got some video.
Oh, my God!
Maia?
Why aren't you picking this up?
You get this message,
you call me back immediately!
Maybe she didn't take
her cell phone with her.
Maybe they took it away from her.
Jordan's not going to
hurt her, Diana.
Maia went in there to warn him
about the soldiers.
She has an ability
he'd love to have access to.
If anything, he's probably
treating her like a queen.
Maia's vision ended in darkness.
That has never happened before.
We have got to go in there
and get Kyle and Maia to safety.
Well, how do we get past
the beacons?
Aquino and his men
seem pretty damn confident
they can get through.
We go with them.
It's a military operation, Diana.
Lawton's not going to let
two NTAC agents just tag along.
Then we don't ask for permission.
I was born three years ago.
So that makes you, what,
nine years older than me?
Almost ten.
I litterally grew up overnight,
I didn't...
understand
what it meant to be an adult.
You did a lot of bad things.
I was told they were... necessary.
Important.
But that doesn't
make it right, does it?
No. It doesn't.
So what I'm trying to say
is that I'm sorry for scaring you,
and for hurting
people you care about.
Some things are so bad...
saying sorry just isn't enough.
I know.
Maia Skouris.
Welcome to Promise City.
I understand you have
something to talk to me about.
I need to ask you something.
Are you a good guy
or a bad guy?
My mom can't seem to
make up her mind.
I get that a lot.
I'll tell you what.
I have something
I want to show you.
Then you can make up
your own mind.
<i>Yesterday, I promised you miracles.</i>
<i>Today, I'll show you one.</i>
This is the Duwamish river delta.
It's one of the most
polluted waterways
in all of America.
It's loaded
with cancer-causing chemicals,
pcbs, toxic levels of mercury.
<i>It's a blight.</i>
<i>Anastasia?</i>
<i>Anastasia took promicin</i>
<i>when her fiance was killed
in a car accident.</i>
<i>I'm sure you'll agree</i>
<i>she's developed
a remarkable ability.</i>
Now, that's what a river
should look like.
<i>And that's the way
river should taste.</i>
<i>Come on in.
the water's fine.</i>
So, Maia,
now do you think
I'm a good guy
or a bad guy?
Soldiers... with abilities.
They'll be here soon.
They're coming to kill you.
As much as I like to hear
I was right,
it's not going to make
a bit of difference.
Yesterday, you said
that we could deal with this.
The sex scandal, sure,
but Jordan Collier?
This whole Promise City thing?
That we can't get around.
My position
on Jordan is very clear.
I publicly condemned the man
for handing out promicin.
Your whole campaign was constructed
around one concept...
Yes, a middle path
for both 4400s and non-4400s,
one you sold to me,
one I still believe in.
There is no middle path now.
Collier just blew it all up.
Promise City.
Miracles.
We can't compete with that.
So that's it?
You're telling me to just drop out
of the race.
I'm telling you you can't win.
Henders, it's your show.
He's east of here.
Maybe ten blocks.
Those guys get
all the good tricks.
Just be glad Aquino can only
do that camouflage thing
when they're standing still.
We would've lost them
the minute they got over there.
Diana, slow down.
We don't want to get too close.
- I don't want to lose them
- What the hell are you two doing?
Captain, we're not here to interfere
with your mission, okay?
My daughter, she's inside Promise City.
I just want to get her out.
You two get caught,
things get a lot messier for us.
Surrender your weapons,
I'm going to cuff you,
And we'll pick you up
on the way out.
You obviously don't have children.
I said surrender your weapon!
Diana, run!
Okay, that's not good.
Look, I know you're here.
You can't move when you hide.
So I won't hide.
Aren't you sneaky?
10:00 a.m. in the garden.
Good.
Yeah, that works, thanks.
Okay, now we work on
your withdrawal speech.
The important thing is,
you go out with your head held high.
Shawn, there's some
reporters downstairs.
Tell them we'll have the press
conference tomorrow morning.
I'll see them now.
I have some things that I want to say.
Mr. Farrell!
What's your relationship
with Kara Sarkestian?
You receive sexual favors
for healing her mother?
Are you in contact
with Jordan Collier?
Please, please.
First of all,
in spite of my ability to heal,
I am a normal person,
and that means
that I make mistakes.
Obviously,
I made one the other night.
I regret
that my misjudgment
as distracted from
the real issues of my campaign.
Right now as you all know
Jordan Collier is creating
his own separate society in a place
that he calls Promise City,
further widening the divide
between people with abilities
and people without.
He says that he's here
to heal the world,
but what he's doing threatens
to tear everything apart,
which is why
I have no choice
but to continue my campaign,
to continue to be a voice
for unity and cooperation,
and to provide a middle path
that we can all walk together.
- I will answer those questions.
- Mr. Farell...
Senator Lenhoff, are you
still backing Mr. Farrell?
You bet I am!
Shawn, can we get
another statement!
Hey, mommy.
Oh, Maia,
I was so worried about you.
I'm sorry.
I had to warn Jordan.
Jordan?
It's Jordan now?
This place, mom.
They're doing
all kinds of great stuff.
You should see it.
Some other time.
We're leaving.
- Now.
- No.
No?
What do you mean, "no"?
We can't.
We have to stay here.
It's safer that way.
Bad day, huh, dad?
I've had better.
You going to cut me loose?
So now what?
We go see Jordan.
Gentlemen, you're trespassing.
Are you sure
you won't reconsider?
You could join us,
keep your ability.
That's not going to happen.
No, I suppose not.
It pains me
to see gifts like yours wasted.
Make sure they're escorted
out of Promise City.
Collier, wait.
This isn't going to end.
You've painted a huge bullseye
on this place.
The government's going
to keep coming after you.
Then I'll just have to show them
what a very bad idea that is.
Just... wait.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
You are free to go.
Maia, you can come back anytime.
You can even stay here a while
if that's all right with your mother.
Play sleepover in a war zone?
I don't think so.
Sending in those soldiers,
it was a bad idea,
but don't make things worse
by retaliating.
People you work for
are the problem.
They need to learn
to leave us alone.
Your son has a point.
You've promised
the world miracles.
You've even shown us some,
but no one's going to remember
that once you start killing people.
When people start dying,
it's a war.
No matter how powerful
you think you are,
when it's war, you lose.
Don't be so sure.
My mom is right.
If there's a war,
everyone loses.
You saw this?
Just now,
while you were talking.
Please,
you have to listen to my mother.
So, what do you think, Kyle?
Did Maia get through to Collier?
Will he hold off any reprisals?
He's going to do
what he thinks is right,
but he won't hurt anybody
if he doesn't have to.
I guess you can make it
the rest of the way on your own.
I'll turn off the beacon
so you can cross.
Kyle, come with me.
It could be your last chance.
You never give up, do you?
No, and I never will.
That book I told you about?
The prophecy?
Heaven on earth.
Yeah, I remember.
Well, in the book,
there's a list of 200 names.
People who can take promicin
and are guaranteed to survive.
The last name on
that list is you, dad.
So, what are you trying
to say, Kyle?
I'm destined to take promicin
because it says so in some book?
I'm just saying
you're a very important person.
And not just to me.
I gotta go.
I don't know about you,
but I'm exhausted.
Yeah, I'm pretty tired, too.
This war,
the one that
you told Collier about,
what exactly did you see?
Actually...
I didn't see anything.
Sweetheart,
it doesn't matter
how bad it is.
You can tell me,
because I need to know.
No, mom, I mean...
I didn't see anything.
I didn't have a vision.
I lied.
Why?
Well, I didn't want
Jordan to hurt anyone,
and he wasn't listening to you.
And you knew he'd listen to you?
I hoped he would.
I hope he did, too.
You know, mom,
Jordan's not a bad person.
I think he's...
one of the good guys.
Well,
if he's one of the good guys,
what does that make me?
This is Skouris.
Be right there.
How long have they been there?
They started gathering
about 20 minutes ago.
All right, here comes Collier...
and Kyle's with him.
And Isabelle Tyler.
I thought you said no one could get
close to those beacons.
Someone must be shielding them
from the effects.
They're moving the perimeter.
That's Collier's reprisal.
He's expanding Promise City.
So, what's he saying?
The more we move against him,
the more land he's going to take.
Today south Seattle,
tomorrow what, the world?
That's twice
as bigger as it was before.

4400 avaient disparu
4400 sont revenus
Tous possèdent une aptitude unique
L'un d'entre eux porte un message
Quiconque peut devenir exceptionnel
Le risque est immense
À la hauteur des bienfaits
C'est irréversible
Le monde devra nous accepter.
<i>Précédemment dans</i> Les 4400...
<i>La promicine se répand,</i>
<i>les gens acquièrent des capacités,
et personne n'y peut rien.</i>
Kyle, écoute-moi.
Si tu es impliqué là-dedans...
Collier conduira le genre humain
à la rédemption. Tu l'y aideras.
- Où est-on ?
- Cassie a juste dit qu'on devait venir.
Tu te trompes ce coup-ci.
Tu as toujours été rebelle.
Mais je crois que tu as peur
du changement, Shawn...
ou alors, peur de moi ?
<i>Tu ne sais pas réellement
qui est cette fille.</i>
Bébé...
Écarte-toi de moi.
Je partage mon bureau avec deux des mecs
les plus casse-pieds de la planète.
Je ne comprends pas pourquoi
Collier est revenu à Seattle.
C'est comme s'il nous lançait un défi.
Je vous apporte
un message d'espoir,
<i>pour...
de meilleurs lendemains,</i>
<i>Tout partira d'ici,
dans cette Ville Promise.</i>
J'allais demander si vous étiez sûr
de vouloir participer à l'opération.
Personne ne veut
Collier plus que moi.
Je ne pensais pas à Collier.
C'est mon fils, je dois pouvoir
lui faire entendre raison.
Diana, que se passe-t-il ?
Où sont les autres ?
Aucune idée. Je n'ai vu personne.
Je me suis réveillée
par terre dans la salle de repos.
Pourquoi tu dormais là-bas ?
- Je sais pas.
- Pourquoi je dormais à mon bureau ?
Tout ce dont je me rappelle,
c'est aller...
- me coucher.
- Et moi,
je lisais des dossiers
dans mon salon.
Pourquoi je viens de me réveiller
sous ma chaise ?
Vous savez
comment on est arrivés ici ?
<i>1re possibilité,
nous sommes attaqués.</i>
Quelqu'un qui en veut au NTAC,
utilisant une aptitude de 4400
contre nous.
- Peut-être plus d'une.
- Ça expliquerait les trous de mémoire,
mais si un 4400
en avait après nous,
pourquoi est-on toujours en vie ?
On serait les seuls survivants
dans ce bâtiment ?
Peut-être,
ou alors, les agresseurs
n'ont pas encore atteint notre étage.
Et il y a une 2e possibilité...
Le monde entier est attaqué.
Le bâtiment réagit
à une situation de crise.
Alors, quoi ?
On est les seuls survivants au monde ?
On ne pourrait pas envisager
une autre explication qu'une attaque ?
Rien ne fonctionne.
On est isolés du réseau du bâtiment,
je peux même pas y accéder.
On peut essayer avec l'unité centrale
de la salle des opérations,
et voir si on peut avoir
un contact avec l'extérieur.
On pourrait aussi aller
jusqu'à la porte d'entrée.
Tu entends l'alarme ?
Ça veut dire que le bâtiment
est verrouillé, et qu'il y restera
jusqu'à ce que quelqu'un
annule les procédures de sécurité.
On est peut-être les seuls ici
à pouvoir le faire.
Bon.
Prépare-toi à y aller.
Peu importe si le bâtiment
est envahi
par tous les positifs de Seattle,
on doit aller là-bas.
Avant, réveille P.J.
Réveille-toi, vieux.
Pas de téléphone, ni d'email, même
la radio de secours ne fonctionne pas.
La vidéosurveillance est HS, aussi.
Impossible de trouver une arme.
Content de vous voir.
Dis-moi que tu as une explication.
Tu peux accéder au réseau,
bon boulot, Brady.
C'est pas moi. Je suis toujours bloqué.
L'alarme s'est arrêtée toute seule.
Toujours pas de téléphone.
L'alarme s'est arrêtée, si le bâtiment
n'est plus verrouillé, on peut sortir.
Ça vaut le coup d'essayer.
Tom, on va aller voir si on peut
trouver un chemin jusqu'à la sortie.
Diana, restez avec eux.
Surveillez-les pendant
qu'ils rétablissent les communications.
Attendez.
- Personne, allons-y.
- Il n'y a personne nulle part.
On n'a vu personne
depuis qu'on a quitté la salle.

Collier,
qu'est-ce que vous avez foutu ?
Papa ?
Kyle ?
C'est quoi, ce cirque ?
- Répondez-moi !
- Kyle, sauve-toi !
Retenez-le !
Kyle, non... attends !
Kyle, ouvre la porte !
Ouvre cette porte, Kyle !
Quoi que tu fasses, arrête !
Tu dois convaincre Collier d'arrêter.
Ouvre cette porte !
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
- Shawn ?
Où on est ?
Tu m'as fait quoi ?
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
J'y suis pour rien.
J'ai rien fait.
On dirait qu'on est au NTAC.
On s'est fait arrêter ?
J'ai travaillé tard chez moi.
Je ne me souviens de rien après.
Le gouvernement rassemble
peut-être tous les 4400.
Avec leurs soldats évolués,
ils ont pu trafiquer notre mémoire.
Et pourquoi
ils nous ont mis ensemble ?
Y a quelqu'un ?
Je comprends pas.
Collier s'est construit une ville
en plein centre de Seattle.
C'est une victoire pour lui.
Pourquoi tout risquer
en assiégeant ce bâtiment ?
Il n'est pas resté
pour nous l'expliquer.
Quoi qu'il prépare,
on doit être prêts à se défendre.
Hé, les gars...
On peut baisser
les portes antidéflagration ?
Elles sont contrôlées par ordinateur,
mais tout est bloqué.
On pourrait bloquer le passage
avec le mobilier.
Super, un rempart
avec des chaises et des bureaux !
Ça va vachement nous aider,
surtout si l'un d'eux peut faire fondre
nos cerveaux à distance.
- Une meilleure idée ?
- Il y a...
une armurerie quelques étages plus bas.
On y stocke les fusils d'assaut.
Collier n'y est peut-être pas
encore arrivé.
Je ne veux pas pointer une arme
sur Kyle, mais...
si Collier
envisage de nous attaquer,
il nous faut plus que du matériel
de bureau pour nous défendre.
- Que se passe-t-il ? Où je suis ?
- On a vérifié la pièce, c'était vide.
Tout va bien. Je suis là.
Tu n'as rien à craindre.
Mon père et son patron
avaient l'air aussi surpris que nous.
Ils semblaient croire
que Jordan nous a amenés ici.
C'est le cas ?
Jordan n'y est pour rien.
Il n'explique pas toujours
ce qu'il prévoit, Kyle.
- Tu devrais le savoir.
- Mes relations avec lui
sont différentes des tiennes.
Il ne me cache rien,
et il n'envisageait pas
d'attaquer le NTAC.
Attendez, les gars.
On n'a pas le temps
de se disputer.
Il faut trouver Jordan.
Il est coincé aussi.
Je n'irai nulle part sans lui.
Bon, faites ce que vous voulez.
Moi, je trouve un moyen de sortir.
Quoi, Isabelle ? Quoi ?
Écoute,
peu importe ce qui se passe ici,
on a plus de chances de s'en sortir
si on reste ensemble.
Alors, reste avec nous,
on va retrouver Jordan,
et on sortira tous ensemble.
Ça ne fonctionne pas.
La serrure devrait fonctionner
sur réserve d'énergie.
À quoi sert une armurerie
si elle est bloquée en cas d'urgence ?
Il faut trouver un levier
pour forcer la porte.
Attendez.
En arrachant le clavier,
on pourrait court-circuiter le boîtier.
Vraiment ?
Vous allez...
débloquer la porte ?
N'ayez pas l'air si surpris.
J'ai participé
à de nombreux groupes de réflexion.
Vous seriez surpris de ce qu'on apprend
au distributeur d'eau.
Essayez avec ça.
- Vous sortez ça d'où ?
- Du tiroir de mon bureau.
Vous disiez qu'on aurait à se défendre
avec du matériel de bureau...
Quoi ?
Rien.
Rien, je...
me demandais
comment vous faites.
On se réveille tous au NTAC
sans savoir pourquoi.
On se retrouve au sous-sol
à forcer la serrure d'une armurerie
pour se défendre
contre Dieu sait combien de gens
possédant sûrement des capacités.
C'est sans espoir, non ?
Mais vous, vous restez concentré.
Si je perdais mon sang-froid
dès que la situation semble désespérée,
je n'aurais pas fait de vieux os
dans ce boulot.
Je me concentre
sur ce qui se présente à moi.
Dans quelques années,
vous réaliserez que vous avez survécu
en faisant la même chose.
Quelques années ? C'est flatteur
de penser que je tiendrai si longtemps.
Tenez, venez, aidez-moi.
Maintenant, pendant que je tourne,
vous tirez, d'accord ?
Voilà.
C'est bon.
Nous y voilà.
Et aucun d'entre vous ne sait
comment on est arrivés là ?
Tout le monde va bien ?
Personne n'est blessé ?
Je vais bien.
- Que fais-tu ici ?
- Les sorties sont bloquées,
alors je cherchais cet endroit.
C'est ici que le NTAC
enferme les 4400...
et ceux qui ont pris une dose.
Je cherchais des alliés.
Toute l'aile est vide,
tu n'as pas de chance.
Si.
J'ai de la chance, je vous ai trouvés.
Ça devrait suffire.
Suffire pour quoi ?
Leur centre d'opération
est au 2e étage.
Matériel de communication,
contrôle de la sécurité.
De là, on pourra contacter
la Ville Promise et obtenir de l'aide.
C'est le bureau de mon père.
Ils y seront tous.
Sûrement.
C'est le seul moyen.
Il faut qu'on arrive là-bas.
Tu parles de neutraliser tout un groupe
d'agents du gouvernement, Jordan.
On va faire quoi,
prendre des otages ?
Shawn, ils nous ont amenés ici
contre notre volonté.
C'est eux qui nous ont agressés.
Je sortirai d'ici dans le calme
si possible, mais je sortirai,
et si vous ne voulez pas passer
le reste de votre vie
dans une de ces cellules, suivez-moi.
- Vous allez bien ?
- Oui, oui.
Oui, c'est bon.
Ça va.
Prêt pour le spectacle ?
La décharge en valait le coup.
Je suis impressionné.
Il n'y a rien là-dedans.
C'est vide !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Vous allez bien ?
<i>Ça va.</i>
Je ne sais pas ce qui est arrivé.
Je vais essayer de rouvrir.
Vous êtes là ?
Mon Dieu, Meghan.
Regardez-moi.
Je comprends rien
à ce qui est arrivé.
La porte s'est refermée toute seule.
On a été séparés que quelques secondes.
C'était un accident, Tom.
Peut-être.
Mais si on est coincés ici,
c'est à cause de Collier.
Il est responsable de sa mort,
comme de celles
de milliers d'autres.
Tout ça n'a aucun sens.
Elle n'aurait pas dû mourir.
On doit reconnecter
les ordinateurs,
concentrons-nous là-dessus.
On cherche quoi, au juste ?
N'importe quoi pour se défendre.
Kyle, c'est dingue.
On va utiliser ça contre quelqu'un ?
J'espère pas.
C'est tout ce que j'ai trouvé.
Un manche à balai ?
Et je dois faire quoi avec ça ?
Utilise-le... ou pas,
mais je n'abandonnerai pas
sans me battre.
Pourquoi penses-tu
qu'on doit se battre ?
Tu disais que quand vous avez
rencontré mon oncle,
il pensait
que tu avais tout organisé ?
Toi, tu penses que c'est eux.
Tu n'as pas envisagé...
que ça ne soit aucun d'entre nous ?
Que quelqu'un d'autre
soit responsable ?
D'abord, on contrôle les opérations,
ensuite on posera des questions.
Non, demandons-leur maintenant !
Tu sembles oublier
qu'un des agents du NTAC
que tu sembles si décidé à combattre,
est mon oncle.
Le père de Kyle.
Il doit bien y avoir un moyen
de discuter avec lui.
J'y vais.
Vous trois, vous m'attendez ici.
Quoi ?
Les dons que le futur t'a donnés
sont bien mérités.
Tu cherches toujours une solution
pacifique, pour tout arranger.
Je t'admire pour ça,
mais c'est pour ça que tu ne peux
rejoindre notre mouvement.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Venez, il faut y aller.
Baissez-vous !
Vous savez, rien ne vous oblige
à garder ce silence gênant.
Vous pouvez vous parler.
Quoi ?
Il n'y a rien de gênant.
Ta mère et moi,
on se parle tout le temps.
Je sais,
mais avant tu venais chez nous
presque tous les soirs.
On jouait ensemble.
On s'amusait bien,
mais tu ne viens plus jamais.
On doit faire
comme si rien n'était jamais arrivé.
C'est compliqué, ma puce,
mais...
Marco et moi... on est amis.
Des amis ne sont pas censés se voir
de temps en temps ?
Sortez tous !
Ils arrivent !
Laisse la porte fermée,
et reste baissée,
quoi qu'il arrive.
<i>Restez tous où vous êtes,
n'avancez plus !</i>
Quoi que vous pensiez faire,
quoi que vous vouliez,
- ça n'arrivera pas.
- Papa, on ne vous veut pas de mal.
S'il te plaît,
laisse-moi passer.
On ne veut pas se battre.
Meghan Doyle est morte, Kyle.
Tu comprends ?
Elle est morte.
- Comment avez-vous pu ?
- Je te l'ai dit, on y est pour rien !
On s'est réveillés ici,
sans savoir pourquoi.
- C'est la vérité.
- Tu mens...
Aïe !
Tu es blessé ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passé ?
Une vitre a volé en morceaux.
Je me suis coupé.
- Et Shawn...
- Shawn?
C'est pas possible.
Ça ne devait pas
se passer comme ça.
Il est mort.
À cause de vous !
Deux personnes sont mortes
à cause de vous !
Je n'ai rien à voir avec ça !
- Vous foutez pas de moi !
- Arrêtez !
Il dit la vérité !
Il ne vous a pas amenés ici.
C'est moi.
J'ai provoqué tout ça.
J'ai pris une dose.
On est tous ici
à cause de mon aptitude.
J'ai pris une dose
il y a environ 2 mois.
Quand la promicine s'est répandue,
j'ai compris
que tout allait changer.
La science, la politique,
la religion.
Je voulais y participer.
Il le fallait.
Et une nuit,
ma fiancée et ma mère
se sont disputées pour la liste
des invités à notre mariage.
Je suis allé me coucher,
en souhaitant pouvoir
faire quelque chose
pour arranger les choses
entre elles.
Quand je me suis réveillé,
je me suis retrouvé ailleurs.
Moi, ma mère, Sara.
Sans savoir ce qu'on faisait là...
on était coincés
dans un immense embouteillage
sur le pont de <i>Spokane Street</i>.
Il ne restait qu'une heure
avant notre mariage.
On a dû se serrer les coudes
pour traverser la ville.
Et ce n'est rien de le dire...
On a dû affronter des séismes,
des inondations, un incendie.
C'était du délire.
Mais on en a réchappé...
ensemble,
et on est arrivés à l'église,
juste à temps.
J'ai embrassé Sara
à la fin de la cérémonie,
puis on s'est tous réveillés
chez nous.
La partie était terminée.
La partie ?
J'ai fini par comprendre
en quoi consistait mon aptitude.
C'est comme dans un jeu.
P.J., ça n'a rien d'un jeu,
deux personnes sont mortes.
Je n'en suis pas certain.
Personne n'est jamais mort.
Je ne sais pas
ce qu'il en est dans le monde réel.
Pourquoi le NTAC ?
Pourquoi avoir choisi cet endroit ?
C'est pas moi qui l'ai choisi.
C'est vous.
Nous tous.
Mais...
je n'ai aucun contrôle
sur ce qui se passe.
Nous choisissons l'endroit,
tous ensemble.
C'est notre subconscient
qui est à l'oeuvre.
Bien que nous percevions
le NTAC différemment,
il est important pour nous tous.
C'est pour cela qu'on est tous ici ?
Tout à fait,
et... il y a toujours un obstacle,
Un obstacle que tous les joueurs
doivent surmonter ensemble.
Je sais que ça a l'air bizarre,
mais dans ce cas précis,
je crois que l'obstacle
est le bâtiment en lui-même.
Le NTAC essaie de nous tuer ?
C'est pas bête.
Le bâtiment a électrocuté Meghan.
Le bâtiment a créé la bourrasque
qui a cassé la fenêtre
et tué Shawn Farrell.
Qu'est-ce qu'on est censés faire ?
Rester assis ici
et attendre notre tour ?
On doit s'aider mutuellement.
C'est ça, l'idée.
Tous les jours,
je m'assieds à mon bureau
et je constate
que la situation empire,
que ce n'est qu'une question de temps
avant que tout explose.
Une guerre
entre les positifs et les négatifs.
Voilà pourquoi j'ai rassemblé
des gens des deux bords.
Je voulais aider.
Je voulais rassembler les 2 camps.
Et on se retrouve à se regarder
mourir les uns après les autres ?
En voilà, une leçon profitable !
Vous n'avez pas mis
que nos vies en péril.
Si Kyle ou moi mourons,
c'est la fin certaine du mouvement.
Vous avez mis en danger
tout ce qu'on a accompli.
On ne va pas se laisser tuer
sans rien faire.
On devrait sortir les ordinateurs,
tout ce qui est électrique.
Non, il doit y avoir
une autre solution.
Les dernières fois où j'ai joué,
je me suis aperçu qu'il y a toujours
une porte de sortie.
Si je la trouve,
je peux la franchir,
et si j'y arrive,
c'est la fin de la partie.
On se réveille tous.
Espérons que
Shawn et Meghan également.
Où est-elle ?
D'habitude,
à l'autre bout du terrain de jeu.
Quand je me réveille
dans une partie,
elle est toujours
aussi loin que possible.
Attends, tu es arrivé
par la salle de théorie ?
Marco, trouve un plan du bâtiment.
Cherche l'emplacement de cette porte.
Tout le monde, mettez-vous au travail,
et soyez prudents.
Tu crois que Shawn est vraiment mort ?
J'en sais rien.
J'espère que non.
Écoute, je sais que tu penses que
j'aurais pas dû prendre une dose,
mais j'étais conscient
de ce que je faisais.
Je savais qu'en suivant Collier,
je devrais m'habituer
à voir des gens mourir,
peut-être même des proches.
J'arrêtais pas de me répéter...
que ces morts n'étaient pas inutiles.
C'était des sacrifices.
Je le crois toujours.
Je t'assure.
Mais voir Shawn
étendu sur le sol...
Souviens-toi de ce que ça fait
la prochaine fois
que Collier te donnera un ordre.
Écoute,
je suis pas là pour te sermonner,
mais tu n'imagines pas à quel point
je me fais du souci pour toi.
À chaque fois que j'entends parler
de Collier aux infos,
à chaque fois que j'achète le journal,
j'ai peur d'apprendre
que tu es en prison,
ou que tu es mort.
Je ne vois pas d'autres fins pour toi.
On pourrait réussir.
On pourrait sauver le monde.
Je veux un fils,
pas un martyr de la cause de Collier.
Il y en a assez, papa.
Désolé, je reste un père malgré tout.
Marco a trouvé quelque chose.
C'est ici, au bout de ce couloir,
au niveau -11.
C'est l'endroit le plus éloigné
du bureau.
Si la porte de P.J. existe,
c'est ici qu'elle se trouve.
- Très bien, j'y vais.
- Pas tout seul.
Cet immeuble est un piège.
Tu ne vas pas y aller seul.
Il ne sera pas seul.
Je suis le seul à pouvoir
mettre un terme à tout ça.
C'est moi qui dois
franchir cette porte.
Prépare-toi, on y va dans 2 min.
Je vous accompagne.
On est censés coopérer.
On devrait partager les risques.
On devrait prendre les escaliers.
Vous aimiez bien Shawn, hein ?
Shawn n'était encore qu'un gosse
quand son père a quitté ma soeur.
J'ai essayé de m'intéresser à lui,
de faire mon possible pour l'élever.
Vous avez fait du bon travail.
C'était un jeune homme...
<i>C'est</i> un jeune homme
hors du commun.
Nous nous sommes éloignés.
C'est difficile,
de perdre quelqu'un pour qui...
Pour qui on a donné tant de temps.
Vous ne pouvez vous en prendre
qu'à vous-même.
Shawn a rompu les liens avec vous,
car il n'adhérait pas à vos croyances,
et vous n'étiez pas
de nature à changer.
Kyle s'est éloigné de vous
aussi pour ça, non ?
Ce n'est pas du tout la même chose.
Pour commencer, c'est à cause de vous
qu'on est là à se demander
si Shawn est mort ou vivant.
Vous avez répandu la promicine,
ce qui lui a permis d'en prendre.
Et 2 personnes que j'aime
sont peut-être mortes.
C'est la peur de la promicine qu'il faut
accuser. Pas le fait de la distribuer.
Votre gouvernement empêche
ceux qui ont pris une dose
d'apprendre à maîtriser leur aptitude.
Vous avez fait d'eux des criminels.
Et puis quoi ? On devrait
vous laisser diriger le monde ?
Vous n'arrêtez donc jamais.
Vous allez tous nous faire tuer !
Si vous ne vous calmez pas,
autant que vous retourniez
à la salle des opérations.
Je trouverai cette porte tout seul.
Les escaliers sont là.
Allons-y.
Vous pouvez y aller en premier ?
Je vous couvre.
S'il n'y a pas de porte de sortie,
il va falloir trouver autre chose.
On sait qu'on ne peut pas
accéder aux générateurs...
Maia, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
J'aide Kyle.
On connaît pas cet endroit aussi bien
que vous, mais on veut aussi aider.
Qui sait ?
On trouvera peut-être quelque chose.
Super.
Maia, va rejoindre Marco, veux-tu ?
- Maman, on veut juste...
- Tout de suite !
Moi aussi, j'ai envie de sortir d'ici.
Tout comme vous.
Je sais que vous me détestez.
Pour tout vous dire, je comprends,
mais on doit s'entraider.
C'est ça, le jeu.
Vous avez mis en danger
la vie de ma fille.
Je sais.
Vous m'avez tirée dessus, non ?
Oui, six fois,
et plus si j'avais pu recharger.
Je me moque complètement de ce que
cette épreuve peut bien représenter.
Vous ne vous approchez pas
de Maia.
Maia, viens par ici.
On y est.
Si on peut passer cette porte,
ce devrait être la fin.
Laissez-moi essayer.
C'est moi.
Dans ma chambre.
C'est bien la porte de sortie,
on dirait.
Je sais qu'une fois tous réveillés,
je vais aller en prison.
Dites...
Dites aux autres que je suis désolé.
Il est mort.
Il n'y a plus rien.
Il n'y a plus de porte.
C'est inutile.
P.J. est le seul
à pouvoir y mettre un terme.
Peut-être,
mais je ne compte pas abandonner.
Moi non plus.
Cette porte n'était rien de plus...
qu'une sortie, un moyen d'en finir.
Il y en a un autre.
On finit le jeu.
Survivre. Gagner.
- Gagner ?
- D'après P.J., il y a un objectif
dans chaque partie,
un but précis.
- On ne sait pas ce que c'est.
- Pour l'instant,
mais on ne le trouvera sûrement pas ici.
On remonte à la salle des opérations,
on reste ensemble,
on trouve comment survivre.
Une minute.
C'est moi
ou la température augmente ?
L'air doit bien être dans les 40°C.
Cet endroit va tous nous faire cuire ?
Génial.
Je ne sais pas pour vous, mais...
je préférerais
être électrocuté que fricassé.
Personne ne sera cuit.
Les systèmes de régulation
sont quelques étages plus bas.
On peut modifier
la température manuellement.
Ça marchera pas.
Le contrôle de la température
passe par le réseau principal,
et le système
est toujours inaccessible.
Il faut neutraliser le bâtiment.
Tout fonctionne grâce à l'électricité.
Si on coupe l'électricité,
il ne peut plus rien nous faire.
Si on éteint tout, on gagne.
Couper l'électricité,
on y a déjà pensé !
Les générateurs de secours
sont verrouillés.
En fait, c'est pas si bête que ça.
On ne peut pas arrêter les générateurs
parce qu'on ne peut pas y accéder,
mais si on parvient
à créer une surcharge électrique...
suffisante pour bloquer
les systèmes de secours...
Le courant serait coupé,
et tout s'arrêterait.
Deux circuits principaux
alimentent tout le bâtiment.
Le circuit standard,
et le circuit de secours.
Si on trouve un endroit
où ils sont assez proches...
On connecte les 2 lignes et "zap" !
Court-circuit.
Ici. Tous les serveurs informatiques
se trouvent là-dedans.
Tous les conduits passent par là.
Si P.J. ne nous a pas sortis d'ici
dans 2 minutes,
Marco, toi et moi, on y va.
Trouvez le plus long
cordon d'alimentation possible
et retirez la gaine isolante.
Vous nous accompagnez.
C'est votre idée.
Vous avez l'occasion
de la réaliser.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Le bâtiment...
Notre plan doit pas lui plaire.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Il ne laisse plus entrer l'air...
Il l'aspire.
OK, on n'a plus le temps d'attendre.
On y va, maintenant.
Les portes !
- <i>Y a quelqu'un ?</i>
- Bouge pas.
- <i>Papa !</i>
- Kyle, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Le bâtiment nous a enfermés.
Il aspire tout l'air de la pièce.
<i>Tom, il ne nous reste pas
beaucoup de temps !</i>
Tu dois essayer
de court-circuiter
<i>l'arrivée d'électricité !</i>
C'est tout que j'ai trouvé.
Il faut l'utiliser
pour relier ces deux circuits.
Si Marco a raison,
tout va s'éteindre.
Il n'y pas assez de câble.
Trouvez-en plus !
Ces lignes électriques...
elles sont scellées dans le mur.
Si on pouvait arracher ça
du plafond.
Ils sont en train de mourir.
On n'a pas le temps.
Il y a un moyen...
de relier ces deux boîtiers.
Nous.
On ferme le circuit nous-mêmes.
Vous voulez dire...
faire passer des milliers de volts
à travers nos corps ?
On va mourir.
C'est sûr,
mais si vos collègues ont raison...
Tout sera terminé.
Alors ?
Vous n'avez pas l'air
d'avoir peur des sacrifices...
J'essaie de me convaincre
que ce n'est qu'un jeu...
Mais vous savez quoi ?
J'ai pas vraiment envie de mourir.
Je suis pas prêt
de refaire ça de sitôt.
Comme vous l'avez toujours dit...
Il faut avoir la foi.
- À trois ?
- À trois.
Un...
Deux...
Trois !
Maman !
Ma puce, tu n'as rien.
Tu vas bien.
Tu n'as rien.
Je vais bien.
Jordan est là ?
Tu l'as vu ?
Puis-je parler à Tom Baldwin ?
Salut.
On a arrêté P.J.
Il a essayé d'entrer
dans la Ville Promise à son réveil,
et on...
Je vais bien, je vous dis.
C'est bon.
Excusez-moi, mais...
Je vous ai vue mourir hier soir.
Si vous saviez comme
ça me fait plaisir de vous voir.
Je suis désolé d'avoir...
perdu le contrôle.
Je sais que je vais aller en prison
pour avoir pris une dose.
Ce n'est sûrement pas
le meilleur moment pour dire ça,
mais...
si ce que vous m'avez dit est vrai,
peut-être qu'il en valait le coup...
ce petit jeu.
Comment tu peux dire ça ?
C'était angoissant,
mais mon aptitude...
s'est révélée utile.
Jordan Collier et Tom Baldwin
ont travaillé main dans la main.
Ils ont sacrifié leur vie
pour sauver les autres joueurs.
Ce n'est pas rien, pas vrai ?
Espérons.
Ce serait dommage
d'aller en prison pour rien.
On va bientôt venir vous chercher.
Ça va, toi ?
Ça va faire bizarre,
sans P.J. dans le bureau.
Je sais que je ne devrais pas...
mais je l'admire un peu
pour ce qu'il a fait.
Je connais bien mieux
Jordan Collier qu'hier.
Et il nous connaît.
Ça ne peut être que positif.
Ouais, enfin...
on verra ce qu'il en sera.
Marco, je...
C'est vrai ce qu'a dit Maia ?
Il y a de la gêne entre nous ?
Difficile à éviter, non ?
Tu as rompu, mais...
je te voyais tous les jours.
Si tu le veux,
j'aimerais vraiment qu'on soit amis.
J'ai promis à Maia de faire
un pain de viande demain soir...
Tu pourrais venir.
Ça lui ferait très plaisir.
Et à moi aussi.
L'infâme pain de viande
de chez Skouris.
J'ai fait des progrès,
je te le jure.
Alors, à demain ?
<i>Votre fils va bien.</i>
<i>Tout le monde va bien.</i>
Je voulais vous le faire savoir.
Eh bien, je vous remercie.
Je lui ai laissé des messages
toute la matinée.
Je viens de parler à Shawn.
Il va bien, lui aussi.
Qu'on se comprenne bien...
Rien n'a changé entre nous.
Je distribuerai la promicine
à ceux qui veulent changer les choses.
<i>Et je développerai la Ville Promise.</i>
Vous finirez les menottes aux poignets,
Jordan, et je le ferai personnellement.
Vous venez de m'appeler Jordan.
Faut croire que oui.
P.J. aura quand même réussi
quelque chose.
Alors, Tom...
Allez-vous raccrocher ?
Ou dois-je le faire ?

<i>v1.00</i>
<i>SeriesSub</i> presents...
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...
<i>Promicin is out there.
<i>People are gaining abilities,
and nothing can be done about that.
Kyle, listen to me.
If you're involved in something...
Collier will lead the human race
to salvation. You will help him.
- What is this place?
- Cassie said we should come here.
You are on the wrong path here.
And you've always
been rebellious,
but I think
you're afraid of change, Shawn...
or is it just me?
<i>You don't really
know this girl at all, do you?
Baby...
Get your hands off of me.
I share an office with two of the most
annoying guys on the planet.
I don't understand why Collier
would risk coming back to Seattle.
It's like he's daring us
to catch him.
This is a message of hope
<i>for a better tomorrow,</i>
<i>and it begins here,</i>
<i>in Promise City.</i>
I was going to ask you if you wanted
to be a part of this operation.
Believe me, I want Collier
as much as anyone.
It's not Collier
I was thinking about.
He's my son. I've got to believe
I can still reach him.
Diana, what the hell's going on?
Where is everyone?
I don't know.
You're the first person I've seen.
I just woke up
on the floor of the break room.
Why were you sleeping
in the break room?
- I don't know.
- Why was I sleeping at my desk?
The last thing I remember
was going...
- to bed at home.
- The last thing I remember,
I was going over case files
in my living room.
Why did I just wake up
underneath my office chair?
Please tell me
you know how we got here.
<i>Possibility one,
we're under attack.
Someone with a grudge
against the NTAC,
used a 4400 ability against us.
- Maybe more than one.
- That would explain the memory gaps.
But if a 4400
were coming after us,
why are we still alive?
Are we the only survivors
in the building?
Maybe,
or maybe the attackers haven't
gotten down to our level yet.
Let's not ignore
possibility two...
The world at large
is under attack.
The building's reacting to
a security situation out there.
So, what, we're the only
survivors in the world?
Could we come up with a possibility
that doesn't involve an attack?
It's not responding.
We're locked out of
the building's network.
I can't even
access the system.
Maybe we can do it from OPS.
Try to get in through the mainframe,
establish some kind of contact
with the outside world.
Or maybe we could just
walk out the front door.
Do you hear that alarm?
That means the building's sealed,
and it's going to stay sealed
until someone overrides
the security protocols.
We could be the only ones here
who know how to do that.
All right.
Get yourself ready to go.
I don't care
if this building is crawling
with every p-positive in Seattle,
we're getting to OPS.
First, wake up P.J.
Wake up, man.
No phones, no email.
Even the emergency radio doesn't work.
Internal surveillance is down, too.
I can't find a sidearm
anywhere.
Good to see we're not alone.
God, tell me
you've got some answers.
You got into the network.
Good job, Brady.
That wasn't me.
I'm still locked out.
The alarm just went silent.
The phones are still dead.
If the security system is down,
that could mean the exits aren't sealed.
We could get out of here.
It's worth checking out.
Tom, you and I will scout ahead,
make sure there's
a safe path to the exit.
Oh, and, Diana, make sure
you stick with these guys.
Watch their backs while they work
on establishing communications.
Wait.
- Let's go. No one's there.
- There's no one anywhere.
We haven't seen a soul
since we left OPS.

Collier, what the hell
did you do to this place?
Dad?
Kyle?
What's going on here?
- Answer me!
- Kyle, run!
Hold it!
Kyle, no!
Kyle, wait!
Wait, kyle!
Open the door.
Open the door, Kyle!
Whatever you're doing here,
you have to stop.
You have to convince Collier
to stop.
Open the door!
What are you doing here?
Where are we?
What did you do to me?
What the hell is going on?
It wasn't me.
I didn't do anything.
This looks like NTAC.
Did we get arrested?
I was working late
in my apartment.
I don't remember anything
after that.
Maybe the government's
rounding up 4400s.
They have soldiers with abilities.
They could've messed with our memories.
Why would they put
you and me together?
Hello?
I don't understand.
Collier has just built
a huge settlement for himself
in the middle of Seattle.
That's a huge win for him.
Why would he risk everything
and attack the building?
He didn't stick around
to explain himself.
Whatever he's planning,
we have to be ready to defend ourselves.
Guys...
Can we lower the blast doors
over the entrances to this room?
They're controlled by the computer,
and we still can't access the system.
We could move the furniture
and build a barricade.
Great, we'll make a wall
made out of desks and chairs.
I'm sure that will be really helpful,
especially if they've got somebody
who can melt our brains
from around the corner.
- Do you have a better idea?
- Wait, there's a weapons locker
a few floors down. That's where
we store all the assault rifles.
Maybe Collier hasn't
gotten to it yet.
Believe me, I don't want to
point a gun at Kyle, but...
if Collier
is leading some kind of attack,
we need something more than
office supplies to fight back with.
- What's happening? Why am I here?
- We checked that room. It was empty.
You're okay now.
You're with me. You're safe.
My dad and his boss seemed
just as surprised as we were.
It sounded like they thought
Jordan brought us here.
Did he?
Jordan had nothing
to do with this.
He doesn't always
share his plans, Kyle.
- Guess you haven't learned that yet.
- My relationship with him
is different from the one you two had.
He doesn't hide things from me,
and he sure wasn't planning
an assault on NTAC.
You guys, wait.
We can't fight,
not now.
We've got to find Jordan.
He's trapped in here, too.
I'm not going anywhere
without him.
You guys do whatever you want.
I'm going to find my way out of here.
What, Isabelle?
What?
Listen,
whatever's going on here,
we have a much better chance
of getting out if we stick together.
Now, stay with us.
We'll find Jordan,
and we'll leave as a group.
It's not responding.
These locks are supposed
to run on reserve power.
What good is a weapons locker if you
can't get into it during an emergency?
Maybe we can find a crowbar
or something. Try to force the door.
Hold on.
If we can pry that face-pad off,
I might be able to short-circuit it.
Really?
You're going to...
hotwire the door open?
Don't look so surprised.
I worked in a think tank
for years.
You'd be amazed at the things
I picked up around the water cooler.
Try this.
- Where'd you get that?
- My desk drawer.
You said we might have to defend
ourselves with office supplies, so...
What?
Nothing.
Nothing, I'm just...
wondering how you do it.
We all wake up in the middle of NTAC
with no explanation,
and now we're down in the basement,
trying to break into a weapons locker
so we can fight off an attack
by God knows how many people
with 4400 abilities.
It seems pretty hopeless, right?
But you,
you just keep moving forward.
If I stopped cold
every time a situation looked hopeless,
I wouldn't have lasted
very long in this job.
All I do is focus on
what's in front of me.
In a few years, you'll look back,
and you'll realize that you survived
by doing exactly the same thing.
A few years? I'm flattered
you think I'll last that long.
Here, come on,
give me a hand.
Right now, I'll twist,
and you pull, all right?
There.
All right.
There we go.
Jordan...
And none of you has any idea
how we got here?
But everyone's all right?
Nobody's hurt?
I'm fine.
- What are you doing here?
- All the exits are sealed,
so I looked for this place.
NTAC imprisons 4400s here,
and those who have taken the shot.
I was looking for allies.
The entire wing's empty,
so I guess you're out of luck.
No.
I'm not out of luck. I found you three.
That should be enough.
Enough for what?
Their operations center's
on the second level.
Communications gear,
security controls.
We get there, we can contact
Promise City, send for help.
That's where my dad's office is.
They're all going to be there.
Likely,
There's no other way.
We need control of that room.
You're talking about overpowering
a bunch of government agents, Jordan.
What are we gonna do,
take hostages?
Shawn, they brought us here
against our will.
They're the aggressors.
I'll walk out of here peacefully
if I can, but I will walk out of here.
And any of you
not wanting to spend
the rest of your life in one of
these cells should join me.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it's fine.
It's fine.
Prepare to be impressed.
Guess the shock was worth it.
I'm impressed.
There's nothing here.
It's empty!
What happened?
Are you all right?
<i>I'm fine.
I don't know what happened.
I'll try and get the lock open again.
Are you there?
My God, Meghan.
Look at me.
I don't understand
what happened.
It's like that door closed by itself.
We were only apart for a few seconds.
It was an accident, Tom.
Maybe.
But we wouldn't be stuck in here
if it wasn't for Collier.
Meghan's death is on him.
We can add it to the list of thousands
he's responsible for.
<i>This doesn't make any sense.
<i>She shouldn't be dead.
<i>We have to get
the computers back online.
<i>Let's just focus on that.
What exactly are we
supposed to be looking for?
Anything we can use
to defend ourselves.
Kyle, this is crazy. Are we supposed
to use these on someone?
I hope not.
This was all I could find.
A broom handle?
What am I supposed to do with this?
Use it, or don't,
but I'm not inclined to give up
without a fight.
See, why do you think
that we need to fight?
Didn't you say that
when you ran into my uncle
that he thought
that you were behind this?
You think that they are.
Does that not beg the question,
what if it was neither of us?
What if something else
is causing this?
First, we control that room,
then we ask questions.
No, let's ask them now.
What you seem to be forgetting
is one of those NTAC agents
that you are so intent
on battling is my uncle.
Kyle's father.
There's gotta be some way
that we communicate with him.
I'll go.
You three can wait here for me.
What?
It's just the future gave you
the right ability.
You're always looking for
the peaceful solution, for healing.
I admire that,
even if it means you can't be
part of the movement.
What's going on?
Come on, we need to go.
Get down!
You know, it doesn't have to be
so weird and quiet in here.
You guys
can talk to each other.
What?
It's not weird and quiet.
Your mom and I talk to each other
all the time.
I guess,
but you used to come over
almost every night.
We'd play games.
It was fun,
and you don't come over anymore.
It's like we're supposed to pretend
nothing ever happened.
It's complicated,
sweetie, but...
Marco and I, we are friends.
Aren't friends supposed to
see each other sometimes?
Everybody, get out here!
They're coming!
You keep the door locked
and stay down,
no matter what you hear.
Everyone, stay back!
just stay back!
Whatever you're here to do,
whatever you want,
- it's not going to happen.
- Dad, we're not doing this.
Please let me in.
We don't want to fight.
Meghan Doyle
is dead, Kyle.
Do you understand?
She's dead.
- How could you do this?
- I told you, it's not us, all right?
We just woke up here.
We don't know what happened.
- It's the truth.
- You're lying...
Oh, God.
You're hurt?
What happened?
A window blew out.
I got cut.
- And shawn...
- Shawn?
Oh, no...
This isn't right.
This isn't how it's
supposed to happen.
He's dead.
Because of you!
Two people lost their lives
because of you!
I had nothing to do with this!
- The hell you didn't!
- Stop!
He's telling the truth!
He didn't
bring you here.
I did.
I made this happen.
I took the shot.
We're all here
because of my ability.
I took the shot
about two months ago.
Once promicin got out there,
I knew it was going to
change everything forever.
Science, politics, religion.
I just wanted
to be part of it.
I had to be part of it.
Then one night,
my fiancee and my mother
had this huge fight
about the guest list at our wedding.
I went to bed
wishing there was
something I could do
to smooth things over
between them.
When I woke up,
I was someplace else.
Me, my mom, Sara.
We didn't know
how we got there, but...
we were trapped
in this huge traffic jam
on the Spokane street bridge.
It was an hour away from when
we were supposed to get married.
We had to work together
to get across town,
and when I say "work",
I mean, work.
There were earthquakes,
floods, a fire.
It was crazy.
But we survived together,
and we got to the church
just in time.
I kissed Sara
at the end of the ceremony,
and then we all woke up at home.
The game was over.
The game?
I figured out how it works
since then my ability.
It's like a game.
P.J., stop using the word "game".
There are two people dead.
I'm not sure about that.
No one's ever died before.
I don't know what that means
for the real world.
Why NTAC?
Why did you pick this place?
I didn't pick it.
You did.
We all did.
But I have no control
over anything else.
We determine where we go,
all of our mind, together.
It's a subconscious thing.
NTAC means something
different to each of us,
but it matters to everyone?
That's how we got here?
Exactly,
and there's always an obstacle...
Something all the players
have to work together to overcome.
I know this sounds weird,
but in this case,
I think the obstacle
is the building itself.
You're saying NTAC
is trying to kill us?
That makes sense.
The building electrocuted Meghan.
The building caused the wind burst
that shattered that window
and killed Shawn Farrell.
So, what are we supposed to do?
Just sit here
and wait for it to pick us all off?
We're supposed to work together.
That's the whole point.
I sit in my office every day,
and I read about how
things are getting worse,
about how it's just a matter of time
before everything blows up.
A war between
positives and negatives.
That's why I brought
people from both sides here.
I wanted to help.
I wanted to bring
the two camps together.
So we get to watch
each other die one by one?
That's a hell of a valuable lesson.
You haven't just
put our lives at stake.
If I die, if Kyle dies here, that could
mean the end of the movement.
You've jeopardized
everything we've worked for.
Let's not make it easy
for this place to hurt us.
We should move all the computers
outta here. Anything electronic...
No, there might be a way out of this.
The last couple times I played,
I figured out that
there's always a back door.
If I find it,
I can walk through it,
and if I do,
the game ends.
We all wake up.
Hopefully,
Shawn and Meghan do, too.
Where is it?
It's usually at the far
edge of the playing field.
Wherever I woke up in the game,
it's as far away from there
as possible.
Wait, wait, you came to
in the theory room, right?
Marco, find some maps
of the building.
Figure out where this
back door should be.
Everyone, get to work,
and be careful.
Do you think Shawn's really gone?
I don't know. Let's hope not.
Look, I know you think
taking the shot was wrong.
But I knew what I was doing.
I mean, I knew that
following Collier meant
I had to get used to people dying,
maybe even people I knew.
I kept saying, you know,
these deaths weren't meaningless.
They were sacrifices.
I still believe that.
I do.
But seeing Shawn lying there...
You might want to remember that feeling
the next time Collier
hands down orders.
Look, I don't want to lecture you,
but you don't know what it is
to worry about you the way I do.
Every time I hear something
about Collier on the news,
every time I pick up
the paper in the morning,
I'm afraid that I'm going
to learn that you're in jail,
or that you're dead.
I don't see how it could
end any other way for you.
We could win.
We could save the world.
Well, I want a son,
not a martyr for Collier's cause.
Dad, that's enough gauze.
I'm sorry.
I guess I never stop being a dad.
I think Marco's got something.
That's it. The dead end
of this hallway on sub-level 11.
That's the farthest point
in the building from our office.
If P.J.'s back door is anywhere,
that's the spot.
- All right, I'll go.
- Not alone, you won't.
This whole building is one big trap.
We're not sending you
out there on your own.
He won't be alone.
As far as I know,
I'm the only one who can end this.
I have to be the one
to walk through that door.
All right, get yourself ready.
We're leaving in 2 min.
I'm going with you.
This is supposed to be
an exercise in cooperation.
I think it's fitting
we divide the risk.
I'm thinking
we should take the stairs.
You cared about Shawn, didn't you?
Shawn was just a little kid
when his father left my sister.
I tried to take an interest in him,
do what I could
to help raise him.
Well, you did a fine job.
He was an extraordinary...
He is...
an extraordinary young man.
He and I have grown apart.
It's difficult,
losing someone you've...
You've invested so much time in.
You made that bed for yourself.
Shawn broke off from you because
he didn't agree with what you believe in
and you were too rigid to change.
Isn't that why Kyle
pulled away from you?
Hey, don't compare
the two situations.
For one thing if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be standing here
wondering whether
Shawn was alive or dead.
You put the shots out there,
which is why he could take one,
and that's why two people
I care about might be dead.
The spread of promicin is not to blame.
The fear of it is.
Your government prevents
people who've taken the shot
from learning
how to control their abilities.
You've criminalized the gifted.
So what? We should all just step
aside and let you run the world?
Can you two ever stop arguing?
You are literally going
to get us all killed!
If you can't calm down,
you both might as well
go back to OPS right now.
I'll find the way out myself.
These are the stairs. Let's go.
Would you mind going first?
I got your back.
If this back door thing doesn't work out
we're gonna need another plan.
We already know we can't
get to the generators, so...
Maia, what are you doing?
I'm just helping kyle.
We don't know this
place as well as you guys,
but we might as well pitch in.
I mean, who knows?
Maybe we'll come up with something.
Okay, that's great.
Maia, will you go stand with Marco?
- Mom, we're just trying to...
- Go now.
You know, I want to get out of here too,
just the same way you do.
I know you hate me.
Tell you the truth, I don't blame you,
but you do need to work with me.
That's the game.
You threatened my daughter's life.
I know.
You shot me for it, remember?
Yeah, six times,
more if I could have reloaded.
I really don't care what this little
exercise is supposed to be about.
You just stay the hell away
from Maia.
Maia, come over here.
That's it.
If we can get through that door,
that should be the way out.
Let me try.
That's me.
My bedroom.
Looks like we found our back door.
I know I'm going to jail
when we all wake up.
Just...
make sure everyone knows
I'm sorry.
He's dead.
It's gone.
The way out, it's gone.
That won't work.
P.J. said he's the only
one who can end this early.
Yeah, well, I'm not giving up.
Neither am I.
The back door was just that,
a way out, one option.
There is another.
We play out the game.
Try to survive. Win.
- Win?
- P.J. said there was
a goal to every game,
an end point.
- We don't know what that is.
- Not yet,
but I doubt we'll find it down here.
We head back up to the operations room,
we stick together,
figure out a way to live.
Wait a second.
Is it me or is it
getting hotter in here?
That air's got to be
well over a hundred degrees.
So this place is going to cook us all?
I don't know about you guys,
but personally
I'd rather be electrocuted
than fricasseed.
Nobody's getting cooked.
The environmental controls
are just a few floors down.
We can change
the temperature manually.
It won't work.
The temperature control
runs through
the main computer network,
and we still can't access the system.
We need to kill the building.
This place runs on power.
We take that away,
it can't hurt us anymore.
We shut the building down, we win.
Cut the power, you don't think
we've thought about that?
The emergency generators
are sealed off.
Well... it's actually
not that bad of an idea.
Look, we can't shut the generators down
because we can't get to them,
but if we could find a way
to create an electrical surge...
big enough to overload
the emergency systems...
There'd be a power outage.
This place would go black.
There's two major power relays that
run throughout this entire building.
Our everyday system
and the emergency line.
If we can find a place where
the 2 relays run close to each other...
Connect the two lines and "zap"!
Short the building out.
There. We keep all the computer
servers in that room.
Every power conduit in the building
runs through there.
If P.J. hasn't gotten us
out of here in two minutes,
Marco, you and I
are heading to that room.
You find the longest
power cord you can
and strip the insulation off of it.
You're coming with us.
It's your idea.
You should have
a chance to see it through.
What is that?
Um, the building.
I don't think it likes our plan.
What's happening?
It's not blowing air
into the room anymore.
It's sucking it out.
Okay, guys,
we're not waiting two minutes.
We're all going now.
The blast doors are down.
- <i>Hello!</i>
- Stay there.
- <i>Dad!</i>
- Kyle, what's happening?
The building shut us off!
Sucking all the air out of the room!
<i>Tom, I don't think
we've got much time!</i>
You have to try
and short-circuit the building's
<i>power supply!</i>
- This was all I could find.
- We need to run that cord
between these two power relays.
If Marco's right,
that'll shut this place down.
This is not nearly long enough.
Then find more!
These power lines are all...
They're all sealed into the wall.
If we could rip these
out of the ceiling.
No, they're dying in that room.
We don't have time.
There is one way
to complete the connection
between these relays.
Us.
We complete the circuit ourselves.
You're talking about...
running thousands of volts
of electricity through our bodies.
We'll die.
We will,
but if your colleagues are right...
We'll end this thing.
So how about it?
You don't strike me
as a man afraid of a sacrifice.
I keep telling myself it's just a game,
but you know what?
I still don't feel like dying.
It's not an experience
I'm looking to revisit.
Well, I guess it's like
you're always saying...
Just have to have faith.
- On three?
- On three.
One...
Two...
Three!
Mommy!
Sweetheart, you okay?
You're okay.
You're not hurt.
I'm fine.
Is Jordan here?
Have you seen him?
Can I talk to Tom Baldwin, please?
Hi.
We, uh... we picked up P.J.
After he woke up,
he tried to make a run for Promise City,
and, uh, we...
I'm fine, really.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's just...
I watched you die last night.
You have no idea how good it is
to see you right now.
I'm sorry that things got...
so out of hand,
and I know I'm going to jail
for taking the shot,
so it's probably
the wrong time to say this,
but...
if everything you told me is true,
maybe it'll be worth it,
playing the game.
How could you say that?
It was scared,
but my ability worked.
Jordan Collier and Tom Baldwin
actually cooperated.
They sacrificed themselves
to save the other players.
That has to mean something, right?
Let's hope so.
I'd hate to think you gave up
your freedom for nothing.
Someone will be here shortly
to take you downstairs.
Are you okay?
It's going to be strange
not having P.J. in the office anymore.
Yeah, I know it's not P.C.,
but I kind of admire what he did.
You know, I know Jordan Collier
a hell of a lot better
than I did a day ago,
and he knows us.
That's got to be a good thing.
Yeah, well...
We'll see about that.
Marco, I...
Was Maia right?
Have things gotten weird between us?
Kind of hard to avoid, right?
You broke up with me,
and I still have to see you
every day.
Well, if you're up for it,
I really would like to be friends,
and I promised Maia
that I would cook a meatloaf
tomorrow night, and...
Maybe you could come by.
I know that
she would really like that.
So would I.
The infamous Skouris meatloaf.
It's gotten better, I promise.
Will I see you then?
<i>Your son's fine.</i>
<i>We all are.</i>
I wanted you to know.
Well, I appreciate that.
I've been leaving
him messages all morning.
I talked to shawn a while ago.
He's...
He's doing all righ, too.
I don't want
any misunderstanding.
Nothing's changed between us.
I'm still gonna give promicin to anyone
who wants to make a difference.
<i>And I will still build Promise City.</i>
And you're gonna wind up
in handcuff,
and I'm gonna be
the one putting them on you.
You called me Jordan just then.
I guess I did.
P.J. accomplished that much, anyway.
So... Tom...
Would you like to hang up,
or shall I?

À la hauteur des bienfaits

<i>Précédemment dans</i> Les 4400...
Diana, que fais-tu ?
Diana n'est plus
tout à fait elle-même.
Elle fera tout
ce que Tess lui demande.
<i>Tess est schizophrène.</i>
Le stress de devoir se cacher,
le sentiment de culpabilité,
elle ne le supporte pas.
Ça a causé sa crise !
<i>Elle a besoin de soins médicaux.</i>
<i>Je ne sacrifierai pas Tess
pour vous.</i>
<i>C'est ton choix,
mais tu es ma fille.</i>
<i>Si tu arrêtes,
je resterai à tes côtés.</i>
Papa ?
<i>Et mon père,
quelqu'un a de ses nouvelles ?</i>
<i>Ils m'ont fait quelque chose.</i>
<i>Ils sont entrés dans ma chambre,
habillés comme pour une opération.</i>
<i>Ils m'ont injecté un truc.</i>
<i>Matthew Ross...</i>
<i>S'ils avaient pris ce qui était en lui
pour me l'inoculer ?</i>
- Dis-moi que tu es encore toi-même.
- Je pense.
Désolée, il est tard.
Je ne vous dérange pas ?
Non, j'étais...
Bon, parce que
je ne savais pas où aller.
Je suis sortie avec des amis,
voir une reprise d'<i>Arcadia</i>.
Vous savez...
la pièce de Tom Stoppard ?
Bref, à la fin du spectacle,
j'ai trouvé ça, sur mon pare-brise.
Il y en avait
sur toutes les voitures.
En gros, pour être cool,
prenez de la promicine.
J'ai entendu aux infos
l'histoire de 2 gamins qui en ont pris.
Ils avaient 12 ans.
Ils sont morts tous les deux.
On perd cette guerre, Tom.
<i>Mon Dieu... merci.</i>
C'est une de mes préférées.
Allez, tout le monde.
Dansons.
Bonjour.
C'est Shawn.
- <i>Shawn, c'est Kevin Burkhoff.</i>
- Dr Burkhoff ?
Écoute-moi,
j'ai peu de temps.
C'est à propos de Tess, OK ?
<i>Sa schizophrénie
n'est plus maîtrisable.</i>
J'ai essayé toutes les combinaisons
de médicaments possibles, sans résultat.
Il faut que tu l'aides,
que tu la guérisses.
- Avant qu'elle fasse du mal.
- Tu peux l'amener au centre ?
<I>Non, écoute-moi.</i>
Elle a pris en otage un resto,
tu comprends ?
Elle empêche
tout le monde de partir.
<i>On est coincés ici.</i>
Raccroche le téléphone.
<i>Dr Burkhoff ?</i>
Où es-tu ?
Où est ce resto ?
<i>C'est la dernière, cette fois.
Après, je m'en vais.</i>
<i>Je vous ai assez dérangé.</i>
<i>Je devrais peut-être
faire du café.</i>
<i>Je suis assise ici
depuis des heures,</i>
<i>à disserter sur la promicine,
Jordan Collier, et...</i>
<i>au lieu de me mettre dehors,
vous m'offrez du café ?</i>
C'est si... gentil.
Gentil, je ne sais pas.
Égoïste, peut-être.
Depuis que Kyle est parti,
la maison est un peu vide.
En plus, je sais
combien ce boulot peut-être stressant.
Souvenez-vous, j'ai cru être possédé
par une sorte d'entité du futur.
Je me suis fait retirer
une tache inoffensive sans raison.
Mais elle a disparu, non ?
- Laissez-moi voir.
- Oui, je pense.
Désolé.
Je ne sais pas ce qui m'a pris.
Il nous faudrait peut-être du café
à tous les deux.
Plus tard, peut-être.
Tu peux me dire
pourquoi on fait ça
à 6h30 du matin ?
Parce que j'aime bien avoir
des tomates fraîches avec mes oeufs.
En plus,
j'adore travailler au jardin.
J'ai l'impression de me rendre utile
bien que je n'aie pas d'aptitude.
Je dois avouer
que c'est plutôt incroyable.
Il y a une semaine, ce terrain était
complètement pollué, et maintenant...
on fait la première récolte.
Ah oui, tu es impressionné ?
Attends seulement qu'on les mange.
D'accord.
Très amusant.
Qui fait ça ?

Alors...
Ça fait combien de temps ?
6 mois ?
Quelque chose comme ça.
Après tout ce temps, tu n'as pas l'air
si heureuse que ça de me voir.
La dernière fois,
tu as essayé de me tuer.
Je ne suis pas venu te faire du mal.
Comment êtes-vous arrivé ici ?
J'ai des amis.
Des 4400 qui vivent ici, maintenant.
Ils m'ont laissé
la clé sous le paillasson.
Maintenant, si ça ne te gêne pas,
j'aimerais être seul avec ma fille.
Kyle, c'est bon.
- Tu es sûre ?
- Oui.
Pourquoi es-tu venu ?
Pour te faire des excuses.
Te dire à quel point je regrette
d'être un père aussi lamentable.
Je n'ai pas non plus été
la fille idéale.
Tu avais besoin de conseils.
Qu'on t'apprenne
à différencier le bien du mal.
Je n'étais pas là pour toi.
J'ai essayé, mais en vain.
Tu avais tant de pouvoir,
même étant bébé.
Je n'ai jamais pu m'y faire.
Tu as grandi
en l'espace d'une nuit.
Ta mère s'est mise à vieillir si vite...
Je ne voulais pas me l'avouer,
mais...
Je pense que je t'ai tenue responsable
de sa mort.
Je l'étais, peut-être.
Je ne sais pas quoi en penser.
- Je n'ai jamais voulu lui faire de mal.
- Je le sais.
Mais toutes ces horreurs
que j'ai faites...
C'était ma faute.
Mes décisions, pas les tiennes.
Tu n'étais pas prête
à prendre ce genre de décisions.
Le futur s'est servi de toi,
ainsi que Dennis Ryland.
Si j'en avais eu la force,
j'aurais pu éviter tout ça.
Au lieu de ça, j'ai laissé les choses
s'aggraver entre nous,
et nous en avons payé le prix.
Je souhaite seulement
qu'on redevienne père et fille.
Moi également.
Tu vas rester, hein ?
Je le veux vraiment.
Moi aussi.
Bonjour, Richard.
Bienvenue dans la Ville Promise.
Oh, pardon.
Tom, la deuxième fois,
on l'a fait la lumière allumée,
je pense que tu as déjà tout vu.
Tu peux m'aider...
Je vais devoir passer chez moi
pour me changer.
Parfait, comme ça,
on n'arrivera pas ensemble.
Ça ne sera gênant
que si on le veut bien.
- Et ce ne sera pas le cas, hein ?
- Exact.
La nuit dernière, c'était...
pour rigoler.
On en a bavé depuis deux mois.
On avait tous les deux besoin...
de se changer les idées,
se détendre.
Pas la peine d'aller plus loin,
d'accord ?
Alors, pour toi,
la nuit dernière était...
sans lendemain ?
Eh bien, oui.
Je pense.
- Pas toi ?
- Si, si.
Vous avez la liste ?
Tous les restos de Seattle
et des environs
qui possèdent un jukebox.
La musique était des années 50 ?
C'est sûr,
j'ai entendu Chuck Berry.
Vous allez devoir annuler
tous mes RDV d'aujourd'hui et demain.
Vous voulez vraiment
retrouver le Dr Burkhoff ?
Il est recherché,
vous risquez d'avoir des problèmes.
Kevin m'a sauvé la vie
et celle de tous les 4400,
quand le gouvernement a failli
nous tuer avec l'inhibiteur.
En plus, si quelqu'un peut réduire
le risque lié à la promicine,
c'est bien lui.
Il le mérite.
Mais qu'avez-vous tous ?
Pourquoi ils ne dansent plus ?
Ils veulent gâcher ma soirée ?
Ça fait deux jours qu'ils dansent !
Ils sont épuisés, ont besoin de dormir,
tout comme toi.
Dormir ? Mais pourquoi ?
C'est une soirée !
Que va penser Bobby
s'il arrive et que je dors ?
Je t'aime, Bobby.
Il a les yeux de Montgomery Clift.
Si doux, tu vois ?
Et où est-il ?
Pourquoi n'est-il pas encore arrivé ?
Peut-être qu'il ne viendra pas.
Tu es jaloux.
Parce que Bobby est mon copain,
et pas toi.
- Tess, ce n'est pas ça.
- Non, je ne veux rien entendre.
Bobby s'occupe bien de moi.
Il est si mignon.
Il ferait tout pour moi.
Debout, tout le monde.
Allez, dansez !
Alors...
entre fugitifs,
dis-moi comment tu as pu échapper
au NTAC tout ce temps.
On m'a beaucoup aidé.
Des 4400 ont risqué leur liberté...
pour m'offrir un abri,
de l'argent,
tout ce dont j'avais besoin.
Et ces amis...
que pensent-ils de la promicine ?
De ceux...
qui développent des aptitudes ?
Le monde a changé.
Tu l'as changé.
Ils essayent juste
de trouver leur place.
Je vais te dire où elle est...
Ici, dans la Ville Promise.
Tous ceux, possédant une aptitude,
y sont chez eux.
Ce que tu as fait de cet endroit
est incroyable.
Je n'y suis pour rien...
Enfin, je n'étais pas seul.
Tout le monde ici...
a contribué à la réalisation
de la Ville Promise.
Même toi.
Non, je suis sérieux.
Tout le travail
que tu as réalisé au Centre,
tout ce que tu as accompli,
cela a contribué
à notre présence ici.
Si tu le dis.
Mais il y a encore du travail.
Beaucoup, même.
Ton aide me serait
précieuse, Richard.
La télékinésie peut s'avérer pratique
si le gouvernement se décide...
Sans aucun doute, oui...
mais c'est de ton charisme
dont j'ai besoin.
Tous ces gens, ils te respectent.
Ils t'écoutent.
Tu pourrais changer les choses.
Je veux me réconcilier avec ma fille,
pas rejoindre le mouvement.
J'aimerais que
tu puisses concilier les deux.
Kyle dit qu'ils organisent
une soirée de bienvenue.
Je suppose
que c'est un honneur.
M. Tyler !
C'est si bon de vous savoir
parmi nous.
Merci.
Tu vois ?
Tout le monde est content
que tu sois là.
Sans parler de moi.
Jordan a été génial,
et Kyle, aussi.
Mais, je suis la seule ici
à ne pas avoir d'aptitude.
J'ai du mal
à me sentir chez moi.
J'espérais un peu
que tu m'aiderais à trouver ma voie.
Je suis ici pour ça, Isabelle.
Pour t'aider
autant que je le peux.
Et dès maintenant.
Tu vas avoir la tête qui tourne,
Isabelle. Ne crains rien.
Papa ?
Ce n'est rien.
Tout va bien se passer.
Richard est parti,
avec Isabelle.
Attendez.
Sans aucun doute,
ce type est un vrai pro.
Quand on le coincera,
vous lui demanderez un autographe.
Voilà pourquoi
on ne l'a jamais trouvé.
- Il se cache avec Jordan Collier.
- Je ne pense pas.
S'il était avec Collier,
on le saurait.
Il ne serait pas resté
dans l'ombre.
Il a réussi à rentrer dans
la Ville Promise sans qu'on le sache,
donc, il a pu la quitter,
tout aussi discrètement.
Il semblait pressé.
Je ne peux dire si Isabelle
est inconsciente ou morte.
Il a déjà essayé de la tuer, non ?
Si elle était morte,
pourquoi emporter le corps ?
Ça ressemble plutôt
à un enlèvement.
On saura à quoi s'en tenir
quand on l'aura retrouvé.
On pourrait commencer
par parler à Jordan Collier.
Il a dit qu'il ne voulait pas
rompre toute communication,
alors, voyons s'il était sérieux.
Frappez à sa porte.
Voyez si quelqu'un répond.
Reprends-toi.
Tu auras mal à la tête
pendant un moment.
Bois un peu d'eau.
Tu te sentiras mieux.
Qu'est-ce que tu m'as fait ?
J'ai arrêté l'afflux de sang
dans ton cerveau.
Quelques secondes, pas plus.
Assez pour que tu t'évanouisses.
Pourquoi ?
Où est-ce que tu m'emmènes ?
Loin de Collier et de sa guerre.
Loin de la Ville Promise.
Nous n'avons rien à faire là-bas.
C'est le seul endroit
où l'on est en sécurité.
Le gouvernement, le NTAC,
ils vont tous nous rechercher.
Ils ne nous trouveront pas,
je te le promets.
Désolé d'avoir agi ainsi,
mais c'était la meilleure solution.
Dorénavant,
nous serons à nouveau une famille.
On a un long trajet à faire.
Mange quelque chose.
J'ai pas faim.
Je veux y retourner.
Ça n'arrivera pas.
Tu dois l'accepter.
Allez.
Il faut que tu reprennes des forces.
Bois au moins un peu d'eau.
S'il vous plaît.
Je n'en peux plus.
Ça fait deux jours.
Il faut que j'arrête,
que je me repose.
J'y crois pas.
Réveille-le !
Les autres,
continuez à danser.
Je vais le faire boire.
Viens avec moi.
C'est une vraie torture, pour ces gens.
Arrête ça tout de suite.
C'est ma soirée, Kevin.
Une fille n'a pas 16 ans tous les jours.
Tu as eu 16 ans en 1953 !
Ça fait bien longtemps.
Et la soirée de tes 16 ans
était loin d'être agréable.
Ta première crise de schizophrénie
a eu lieu la nuit d'avant,
et tes parents ont tout annulé.
- Non, c'est faux.
- Si, c'est vrai.
C'est ma soirée !
Je veux voir Bobby.
Où est Bobby ?
Écoute, même si Bobby était vivant,
il aurait quoi ?
- 70 ans ?
- Tu mens !
Tu ne sais pas ce que tu dis.
Regarde ces gens.
Regarde-les !
Tu vois ce que tu leur infliges ?
Enlève... tes mains.
Ne fais pas ça !
Je crains qu'il n'y ait pas
grand-chose à dire, Tom.
Richard Tyler
n'est resté que quelques heures.
Il ne m'a pas informé
qu'il prévoyait d'enlever sa fille.
Vous avez une idée
d'où il pourrait l'emmener ?
Il a dit où il s'était caché
ces derniers mois ?
Une planque ?
Des amis ?
Désolé, papa.
Il ne nous a rien dit.
Il y a bien quelqu'un...
Michael Ancelet.
Ancelet ?
Je me souviens de lui.
C'est un 4400, un vrai.
Quand Richard s'occupait
de la sécurité au Centre,
Michael était son bras droit.
Si Richard cherche de l'aide,
ça pourrait bien être auprès de lui.
Merci pour cette piste.
J'espère qu'elle sera bonne.
Jordan,
pourquoi vouloir les aider ?
Mon père va jeter
Richard et Isabelle en prison.
On a accueilli Richard Tyler
chez nous.
On lui a fait confiance.
Il a trahi cette confiance.
On ne lui doit rien.
En plus,
aider le NTAC...
à appréhender un fugitif
rend ton père redevable envers nous.
Ça peut s'avérer utile.
Et Isabelle ?
Vous ne pensez pas à elle ?
Kyle, je sais que vous êtes
devenus assez proches,
mais le rôle d'Isabelle
dans le mouvement n'a jamais été clair.
Ni le livre, ni Cassie...
ne lui ont attribué
une quelconque importance.
Elle en a, à mes yeux.
Je vais la retrouver,
avant que mon père le fasse.
Essayer de la sauver...
est, au mieux, imprudent.
Mais te perdre toi,
aura de bien pires conséquences
que de ne pas la retrouver.
Ne fais rien de stupide.
Depuis combien de temps
tu prépares tout ça ?
Depuis que j'ai appris
que tu étais dans la Ville Promise.
Tu devrais aller dormir.
Ta chambre est à l'étage,
derrière la porte.
Papa,
c'est une chambre pour enfant.
Je ne tiendrai jamais
dans un si petit lit.
Ne t'en fais pas.
J'ai tout prévu.
Tu seras heureuse ici.
En sécurité.
Je ferai tout pour ça.
<i>Papa !</i>
Tout va bien.
N'aie pas peur.
J'ai un problème.
Je crois que je rétrécis.
Tu m'as fait quoi ?
Je te l'ai dit, Isabelle.
On recommence à zéro.
Tu ne rétrécis pas,
tu rajeunis.
Quoi ?
Papa, j'ai quel âge ?
14 ans ? 15 ans ?
Pour le moment, du moins.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
À quel point je vais rajeunir ?
J'essaie juste de t'aider, Isabelle.
De trouver un moyen
d'améliorer ta vie.
Depuis des mois,
je ne pense qu'à ça.
Puis, j'ai rencontré Cora.
Elle a une capacité incroyable.
Elle peut faire rajeunir les gens.
Voilà ce que je peux t'offrir...
Une chance de recommencer,
de vivre une enfance normale.
Tu oublieras bientôt
les horreurs que tu as faites,
tous ces regrets qui te minent.
Papa, je me débrouillais
très bien toute seule.
Tu n'es pas obligé de faire ça, papa.
Je t'en prie.
Tu sais quel a été
le plus beau jour de ma vie ?
C'était à l'époque
où nous vivions au Centre.
Ta mère y travaillait avec Shawn.
Je t'ai emmenée au parc,
au terrain de jeu.
Je t'ai prise sur mes genoux
sur la balançoire
et je t'ai balancée
pendant près de 20 min.
Tu as rigolé tout le long.
C'était un jour parfait.
Le lendemain, tu te levais
avec 20 ans de plus,
et ta mère mourrait
sous mes yeux.
Je veux qu'on puisse recommencer
et on en a l'occasion.
J'ai recommencé.
J'ai ma propre vie à présent.
Pas parfaite, mais c'est la mienne.
Je t'en prie,
ne m'enlève pas ça, papa.
Je sais que ça te fait peur,
mais bientôt,
tu ne te souviendras de rien.
C'est l'eau que tu m'as donnée
dans la voiture.
C'est comme ça
que c'est arrivé, c'est ça ?
C'est à cause de l'eau ?
C'est comme ça que ça marche ?
Tiens,
je t'ai apporté du beurre.
D'après maman,
c'est efficace contre les brûlures.
Merci, mais ma main va bien.
C'est impossible.
Elle était toute cloquée !
Je peux me régénérer, Tess.
C'est ma capacité,
depuis l'injection.
Tout comme tu peux contraindre
les gens à agir contre leur gré.
Des fois, Kevin...
tu dis des trucs totalement fous.
Je crois que
c'est ça que j'aime chez toi.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Ça doit être Bobby.
Faites comme si vous vous amusiez.
Salut, Tess.
Bobby ?
Il était temps, Bobby.
Tess se demandait
si tu allais venir un jour, Bobby.
Où étais-tu ?
Je suis désolé.
Problème de voiture.
Tu es là, à présent.
- C'est tout ce qui compte.
- Lâche-moi !
Bobby va t'aider, Tess.
Il va t'aider à te sentir mieux.
Je me sens bien.
Crois-moi,
tu ne vas pas bien.
Mais c'est bon.
Je peux arranger ça.
Tout ce que tu as à faire,
c'est prendre mes mains.
Non.
Ne me touche pas.
Tu n'es pas Bobby.
Vous me faites une blague.
Une blague ignoble.
C'est vrai, je suis pas Bobby,
mais je suis vraiment là
pour t'aider.
Tu es malade, Tess.
Shawn peut te guérir.
Il n'y a rien qui cloche chez moi.
Arrête de dire ça.
- Écoute-moi.
- Non.
Gloria a besoin d'un partenaire.
- Tess, écoute-moi.
- Arrête de parler, danse.
Et toi...
Tu n'es plus mon ami.
Tu es méchant.
Je te déteste.
Que fais-tu encore là, Kyle ?
Isabelle a besoin de toi.
J'ai promis à Jordan.
Jordan se trompe.
Ne sois pas si surpris.
Même les messies
peuvent se tromper parfois.
Tu sais
où Richard l'a emmenée ?
À vrai dire, oui.
Je suis à vous.
Je dois juste
écrire cette pensée.
Vous en avez eu pas mal
dernièrement, M. Ancelet.
C'est mon autobiographie.
Vous avez eu
une vie très remplie.
Je vais commencer le CM1.
Il s'agit de quoi, là ?
Une sorte d'ecmnésie ?
C'est ça.
Je me souviens
des gens, des événements,
des rêves, mêmes des pensées.
Si je l'ai vécu,
je m'en souviens parfaitement.
Et vous écrivez tout ?
C'est ce qui m'empêche
de sombrer, sinon...
ça s'empile dans ma tête
jusqu'à ce que mon cerveau explose.
M. Ancelet, vous savez
pourquoi on est là ?
- Richard Tyler.
- Vous savez où il est ?
Je sais surtout
que c'est mon ami.
Je comprends.
C'est important, l'amitié.
Mais, Mike...
apporter son soutien à un fugitif ?
Un 4400 ?
C'est... C'est passible de prison.
Et dans cette prison,
pas d'ordinateurs,
de stylos ou de papiers.
Rien que vous.
Seul avec vos pensées.
Où es-tu ?
Tu as aimé la soupe ?
J'aime bien les vermicelles.
Ce garçon...
celui du Centre....
celui que j'aimais tant...
Il s'appelait comment, déjà ?
Shawn Farrell.
J'ai été méchante avec lui,
pas vrai ?
J'ai du mal à me souvenir
des choses.
C'est pas grave.
On fabriquera
de nouveaux souvenirs.
De bien meilleurs.
Tout ce qu'il faut,
c'est une bonne gorgée,
et c'est fini.
Et après ?
Je ne serai plus moi-même.
Ce sera comme si
je n'ai jamais existé.
Si ta mère était là,
elle voudrait qu'on le fasse.
Elle voudrait
qu'on redevienne une famille.
Qu'on soit ensemble.
Ne bouge pas.
Que lui avez-vous fait ?
C'est une capacité de 4400.
Il veut que
je redevienne un bébé.
Richard, c'est du délire.
- Vous devez arrêter ça.
- C'est entre moi et ma fille.
Ça ne te concerne pas.
Papa, non.
Kyle est mon ami.
C'est le premier
à avoir cru en moi,
qui a cru
que je pouvais changer.
Elle n'est plus la même qu'avant.
En restant à la Ville Promise,
vous l'auriez remarqué.
Viens, Isabelle.
Où crois-tu aller comme ça ?
Loin d'ici.
On va arranger ça, OK ?
Je te promets.
Je peux te parler une seconde ?
Au sujet de Bobby.
Il est ici.
Non, c'est pas vrai.
Si. Il est juste là.
Ça, c'est Kevin.
Bobby t'aime, pas vrai ?
Il est toujours là pour toi.
Il ferait tout
pour ton bonheur.
Oui.
Alors, crois-moi,
c'est bien Bobby.
Va le voir.
Regarde-le dans les yeux.
Vois par toi-même.
Bobby ?
C'est vraiment toi ?
Je t'ai attendu si longtemps.
Je suis là, à présent.
Promets-moi
que tu ne me quitteras plus.
Je te le promets.
Je suis fatiguée.
Je sais.
Shawn peut arranger ça.
Il peut te soigner.
Ça te dirait ?
Ce serait gentil.
Tu es prête ?
J'avais tellement peur...
et j'étais malade.
J'ai fait du mal à ces gens,
c'est ça ?
Tout va bien.
Tu vas mieux, maintenant.
Et ça ira de mieux en mieux.
Je suis tellement désolée.
Faut y aller.
Attendez...
Ils ne se souviendront de rien ?
Pas si je veux qu'ils oublient.
Les renforts arrivent dans 5 min.
Il faut entrer tout de suite.
- Quoi ?
- Si on entre en force,
Richard sera obligé
de se défendre.
Tu as vu ce qu'il a fait
aux gardes de la Ville Promise ?
Tu crois pouvoir le raisonner ?
On va bien voir.
Je ne lui ferai pas de mal,
Isabelle.
Tu as ma parole.
C'est terminé, OK ?
Papa ?
Il faut y aller, Isabelle.
Oh, non...
Ça va ?
- Kyle ?
- Oui.
Diana, vois si tout le monde
va bien dehors
et retiens-les aussi longtemps
que tu pourras, OK ?
Je ferai de mon mieux.
- Où est ta voiture ?
- Derrière.
Viens.
Le NTAC ne sait pas que tu es là.
Par là...
Mais mieux vaut éviter
les axes principaux, au cas où.
Tu me laisses partir ?
Oui, on dirait bien.
Tu sauras retourner
à la Ville Promise ?
J'en suis sorti, non ?
Merci, Papa.
OK, vas-y.
File.
La Ville Promise ?
C'est le dernier endroit
où je voudrais vivre.
Je croyais que
vous et Jordan étiez proches.
Plus maintenant.
Il me fait peur.
Depuis toujours.
Oui, ce complexe du Messie
qu'il a développé...
Très bizarre.
Et tous ses discours,
le Paradis sur Terre...
En toute honnêteté,
je n'y adhère pas.
Restez ici
autant que vous le désirez.
C'est très tentant,
mais nous sommes des fugitifs.
S'ils nous trouvent ici,
tu risques d'avoir des problèmes.
Je suis prêt
à prendre ce risque.
Tu peux utiliser
nos labos médicaux
pour poursuivre tes recherches.
Trouve un moyen de rendre
la promicine inoffensive.
Dis-lui, Kevin.
Quoi ?
Ce n'est vraiment qu'une théorie
pour le moment.
J'aimerais l'entendre.
Je confronte des profils de gens
ayant pris une dose,
ceux qu'on connaît du moins,
pour essayer de découvrir
pourquoi certains survivent
et d'autres pas.
Et les premiers résultats...
sont prometteurs.
Bientôt,
Kevin pense pouvoir prédire
qui survivra ou non
à une dose.
Si les gens savent
qu'ils mourront en prenant une dose,
ils s'abstiendront.
Et beaucoup moins de gens mourront.
Isabelle, tu as entendu
ce que je t'ai dit ?
Tu n'es pas obligée de boire,
si tu ne le veux pas.
Et si je veux pas ?
Je recommence ma vie à 8 ans ?
On pourrait aller voir Cora.
Elle peut peut-être inverser
le processus
et te redonner
ton ancienne apparence.
Ce garçon, Kyle, a risqué sa vie
en venant te chercher.
Que quelqu'un tienne autant à toi,
en dit long sur lui.
Et sur toi.
Peut-être que tu as changé.
Tu n'es peut-être plus la même,
maintenant.
Mais tu veux quand même
que je boive, n'est-ce pas ?
J'aimerais qu'on passe à nouveau
de bons moments ensemble.
Mais comme je l'ai dit,
c'est toi qui décides.
J'ai peur.
Je suis là.
Tu sais que je le tenais ?
Il était là, devant moi,
et je l'ai laissé partir.
Que pouvais-tu faire d'autre ?
L'arrêter ?
S'il sortait de la Ville Promise,
je m'étais promis de le faire.
Et même sans l'amener au NTAC,
je l'aurais au moins ramené ici,
le temps de trouver
une autre issue.
Et qu'aurais-tu fait ?
L'enfermer dans sa chambre ?
Il se serait enfui
à la première occasion.
Tom, tu as choisi
entre la Ville Promise et la prison.
J'aurais fait exactement
la même chose pour mon fils.
J'arrive au moins
à te réconforter un peu ?
Oui.
Désolé.
Merci, d'ailleurs...
d'être passée
et d'écouter mes divagations.
Pas de quoi.
On est amis, non ?
Oui.
Des amis.
OK, de bons amis.
De bons amis.
- Quoi ?
- J'ai senti quelque chose.
- Quoi ?
- Tourne-toi.
Ta tache est revenue.
Papa !

<i>SeriesSub</i> presents...
The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...
- What the hell are you doing?
- <i>Diana's not quite herself right now.
<i>She'll do whatever
tess tells her to.
<i>Tess is schizophrenic.
The strain of hiding out,
the guilt over what we did,
she can't handle it.
It's caused a break.
<i>She needs medical care.
<i>I will not sacrifice
Tess to you.
<i>You made your choice,
but you're my daughter.
<i>If you quit this now,
I'll stand by you.
Daddy?
<i>What about my father?
Has anybody heard from him?
<i>They did something to me
last night.
<i>Those people who came into my room
were dressed for an operation.
<i>They put something into me.
<i>Matthew Ross...
<i>What if they took whatever
is inside of him and put it into me?
- Please tell me that you're still you.
- I think so.
Sorry. I know it's late.
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No, I was just...
Good, because I didn't know
where else to go.
I was out with friends.
The rep is doing a revival of "Arcadia".
You know that...
Tom Stoppard play?
Anyway, when the show let out,
I found this on my windshield.
Every car on the block
had one.
So basically, if you want
to be cool, take promicin.
Today on the news, I heard
a story about two middle school kids
who took the shot.
12 years old.
Both died.
We're losing the war, Tom.
<i>My God, thank you...
This one's my favorite.
Come on, everyone.
Let's dance.
Hello. This is Shawn.
<i>Shawn,
it's Kevin Burkhoff.
Listen to me,
I don't have much time.
It's tess, all right?
<i>Her schizophrenia
is out of control.
<I>I have tried every combination of meds
I can think of.
Nothing works.
So you have to help her.
Or heal her.
Before she hurts someone.
Can you get her
to the center?
<I>No, listen to me.
She's taking over a diner,
all right?
<I>She won't allow
anyone to leave.
<i>We're trapped here.
Put down the phone.
<i>Dr. Burkhoff?
Where are you?
Where's the diner located?
<i>So this is the last one
and then I'm really leaving.
<i>I've kept you up long enough.
<i>Maybe I should put on
some coffee.
<i>You let me sit here
for hours,
<i>ranting about promicin
and Jordan Collier, and...
<i>instead of kicking me out,
you're offering me coffee?
That's so... sweet.
I don't know about sweet.
Selfish maybe.
Since kyle left,
it's been pretty lonely around here.
Besides, I know how
stressful the job can be.
I'm the guy who thought he was possessed
by some entity from the future.
I had a perfectly harmless mole
removed for no good reason.
But it's healing, though, right?
- Let me look.
- Yeah, I think so.
Sorry.
I don't know
why I did that.
Maybe we could both
use some coffee.
Maybe later.
Tell me again
why we're doing this
at 6:30 in the morning?
Because I like to have
fresh tomatoes with my eggs.
Besides, I love
working in the garden.
It makes me feel like I'm contributing,
even though I don't have an ability.
I've got to admit,
it's pretty amazing.
A week ago, this place
was a toxic wasteland, and now we're...
having our first harvest.
Well, you're amazed now.
Wait till we get
to actually eat them.
Okay. Very funny.
Who's doing that?
Dad?
Hello, Isabelle.

So...
What's it been now?
Six months?
Something like that.
I have to say, all that time,
you don't seem so glad to see me.
The last time I saw you,
you tried to kill me.
Isabelle, I'm not here
to hurt you.
How'd you get in here?
I have friends.
4400s
who live here now,
left a key for me
under the mat.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like
a moment alone with my daughter.
Kyle, it's okay.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Why are you here?
I wanted to apologize.
To tell you how sorry I am
for being such a lousy father.
I guess I wasn't exactly
the best daughter.
You needed guidance.
Someone to teach you
right from wrong.
And I wasn't there for you.
I tried, but didn't do a very good job.
You were so powerful,
even as a baby.
I was never comfortable
with that.
And then you grew up
overnight.
And your mother aging
the way she did.
I tried to deny it, but...
I guess part of me
blamed you for her death.
Maybe I was responsible.
I still don't know.
- But I never meant to hurt her.
- I know that.
But all the other
bad things I did...
They were my fault.
My decisions.
Not yours.
You weren't ready to make
those kinds of decisions.
You were used
by the future,
by Dennis Ryland.
If I had been stronger,
I could have prevented all that.
But instead, I allowed things
to get ugly between us.
And we both
paid the price.
All I want is for us
to be father and daughter again.
I want that, too.
You'll stay, right?
I want you to.
So do I.
Hello, Richard.
Welcome to Promise City.
Oh, sorry.
Tom, the second time we did it
with the lights on, it's not like
there's anything you haven't seen.
Could you help me with this zip?
I'll have to make
a quick stop at home to change.
Good. Then we won't be
showing up at the same time.
This is only going to be weird
if we let it.
- And we're not going to, right?
- Right.
Last night was...
Fun.
It's been a rough couple of months.
We both needed a little...
distraction,
a little comfort,
But it doesn't have to be
anything more than that. Okay?
So, you're saying last night
was just a...
one-time thing?
Well, yeah.
I think so.
- Don't you?
- Yeah.
You have that list I asked for?
Every diner
in the greater Seattle area
that has a jukebox.
You sure
it was '50s music you heard?
Pretty sure,
I heard Chuck Berry.
You're gonna have to cancel all
my appointments for today and tomorrow.
Are you sure you should be
going after Dr. Burkhoff?
He's a wanted man.
You could get in a lot of trouble.
Kevin saved my life,
and the lives of all the other 4400s
after the government's inhibitor program
almost killed us all.
And besides, if there's anyone that can
reduce the risk of taking promicin...
It's him.
He's worth it.
What's wrong
with everyone?
Why aren't they dancing?
Are they trying to ruin my party?
They've been dancing
for two days.
They're exhausted.
They need sleep. So do you.
Sleep? Why would anyone
want to sleep? It's a party.
What would Bobby think
if he showed up and I was sleeping?
I love you, Bobby.
He has eyes
like Montgomery Clift.
Soulful, you know?
Where is he anyway?
Why isn't he here yet?
Maybe he's not coming.
You're just jealous.
Because Bobby's my boyfriend
and you're not.
- That's not why.
- No, I don't want to hear it.
Bobby cares about me.
He's so sweet.
He'd do anything for me.
Everybody, get up.
Everybody, dance.
So...
One fugitive to another,
tell me how you managed
to stay off NTAC's radar
all these months.
I had lots of help.
4400s who risked
their freedom to...
to give me shelter,
money, pretty much
anything I needed.
These friends of yours...
How do they feel about promicin?
About people developing abilities?
The world's changed.
You changed it.
They're just trying to
figure out where they fit in.
I'll tell you
where they fit in.
Right here in Promise City.
Everyone with an ability
belongs here.
This is a pretty amazing place
you've created here.
Oh, I didn't do it.
Not alone, anyway.
Everyone here...
has helped to make
Promise City a reality,
including you.
No, I'm serious.
All the work that you did
for me at the center,
everything that
you accomplished,
it all led to us being here.
If you say so.
But there is work
yet ahead of us.
Plenty of it.
And I could use
your help, Richard.
I guess telekinesis could come in handy
In case the government ever decided...
That's a remarkable ability, yes,
but it's your leadership
I could really use.
These people, they respect you.
They listen to you.
You can make
a big difference.
I'm here to reconnect with my daughter,
not join the movement.
Well, I hope you'll
consider doing both.
Kyle says they're
throwing you a welcome party.
I guess I should
feel honored.
Mr. Tyler!
It's so good
to have you with us.
Thank you.
You see that?
Everyone's glad
you're here.
Including me.
Jordan's been great,
and Kyle, too,
but... I'm the only person
here without an ability.
I still feel
like I don't belong.
I was kind of hoping
you could help me find my way.
That's why I'm here,
Isabelle.
To help you all I can.
Starting right now.
You're going to feel a little dizzy,
Isabelle. Don't be scared.
Daddy?
It's okay.
Everything's going to be
just fine.
Richard's gone.
I think Isabelle's with him.
Wait for it.
No doubt about it.
The man is a genuine badass.
Maybe when we catch him,
you can ask for his autograph.
Now we know why
we never caught up with him.
- He's hiding out with Jordan Collier.
- I don't think so.
If Richard was with Collier,
we would've known about it.
He's too important
to be kept in the background.
Somehow, he managed to get into
Promise City without us even knowing,
which means he could have left
just as discreetly.
He looked like
he was in a hurry.
I couldn't tell if isabelle
was unconscious or dead.
He did try to kill her
once before, right?
If she were dead,
why carry the body away?
I think it looks like
a kidnapping.
Well, I guess we won't know
for certain until we find him.
Well, we could start
by talking to Jordan Collier.
He did say he was willing
to keep the communication lines open,
so let's see how serious he is.
Knock on his front door.
See if anyone answers.
Take it easy.
Your head's going to hurt
for a little while.
Drink some water.
You'll feel better.
What did you do to me?
Stopped the flow of blood
to your brain.
Only for a few seconds.
Just enough
for you to pass out.
Why?
Where are you taking me?
Away from Collier's war.
Away from Promise City.
We don't belong there.
That's the only place
we're safe.
The government, NTAC,
they're all going to come after us.
They're not going to find us,
I promise.
I'm sorry I had to do it like that,
but it's for the best.
From now on, we're going
to be a family again.
We've got a long trip ahead of us.
You should eat something.
I'm not hungry.
I want to go back.
That's not going to happen.
You have to accept that.
Come on.
You got to keep your strength up.
At least drink some water.
Please.
I can't do it anymore.
It's been two days.
I need to stop.
Rest.
I don't believe this.
Wake him up.
The rest of you, keep dancing.
I'll get him some water.
Come with me.
You are torturing those poor people
and it's going to stop right now.
This is my big night, Kevin.
A girl only turns 16 once.
You turned 16
back in 1953.
That was a long time ago.
And you never even had
a sweet 16 party.
You told me you had your first
schizophrenic attack the night before,
and your parents called it off.
- No, that's not true.
- Yes, it is.
This is my party!
I want Bobby.
Where's Bobby?
Listen to me. Even if Bobby were alive,
he'd be, like, what?
- 70?
- That's a lie.
You don't know
what you're saying.
Look at those people.
Look at them.
You see
what you're doing to them?
Get your hand off me.
Don't!
I'm afraid
there's not much to say, Tom.
Richard Tyler
was only here for a few hours.
I'm afraid he didn't inform me
of any plot to kidnap his daughter.
Do you have any idea
where he's taken her?
Did he mention where he's been hiding
the last few months?
Safe house?
Friends?
Sorry, dad.
He didn't tell us anything.
There is one name.
Michael Ancelet.
Ancelet?
I remember that name.
He's an original 4400.
When Richard was running
security at the center,
Michael was his deputy.
If Richard goes to anyone for help,
it might well be him.
Thanks for the lead.
I hope it pans out.
Jordan,
why would you help them?
My dad'll throw
Richard and Isabelle in prison.
We welcomed Richard Tyler
into our home.
We trusted him.
He broke that trust.
We owe him nothing.
Besides,
helping NTAC
apprehend a fugitive
puts your father in our debt.
That could prove useful.
What about Isabelle?
Do you care what happens to her?
Kyle, I understand
you two have grown close,
but Isabelle's role in the movement
has never been clearly defined.
Neither the book nor Cassie...
have made any mention
of her importance.
She's important to me.
I'm going to find her
before my father does.
A rescue attempt
is reckless at best.
Losing you
vastly outweighs the
benefit of finding Isabelle.
Don't do anything foolish.
How long
have you been planning this?
Ever since I found out
you moved to Promise City.
You could probably use some sleep.
Your room is at the top of the stairs
through the door.
Dad, this is a kid's room.
There's no way I'm going
to fit in that little bed.
Don't worry about it.
I've got that covered.
You're going to be happy here.
Safe.
I'll be sure of it.
<i>Daddy!</i>
Everything's okay.
Don't be scared.
Something's wrong.
I think I'm shrinking.
What did you do to me?
I told you, Isabelle,
we're starting over.
You're not get smaller,
you're getting younger.
What?
Daddy, what am I?
14? 15?
For now, anyway.
What is that supposed to mean?
How much younger
am I gonna get?
I'm just trying to help you,
Isabelle.
Find a way to make
things better for you.
For month,
it's all I could think about.
Then I met Cora.
She has an amazing ability.
She can actually
make people younger.
That's what I could give you.
A chance to start over,
to have a normal childhood.
Soon, you'll forget about
all those terrible things you did,
all those regrets
weighing you down.
Daddy, I was doing fine on my own.
You don't have to do this, daddy.
Please.
Do you know what the happiest
day of my life was?
It was back
when we were living at the center.
Your mother was working for the
healing foundation with Shawn.
I took you to Madison park.
To the playground.
I put you on my lap,
and we sat on one of the swings,
and I rocked you back and forth,
it must've been 20 min.
You laughed the whole time.
It was a perfect day.
The next morning,
you woke up 20 years older,
and your mother was
dying in front of my eyes.
I want us to be able to start over,
and now we can.
I have started over.
I have my own life now.
It might not be perfect, but it's mine.
Please don't take
that away from me, daddy.
I know this is scary for you,
but soon,
you won't remember any of this.
This is the water
you gave me in the car.
That's how this all started,
isn't it?
It's in the water?
Is that how you're doing this?
Kevin, I brought you some butter.
My mom said it's good for burns.
Thank you, but my hand's fine.
How could that be?
It was all black and blistered.
I can heal myself, Tess.
It's my ability from
when I took the shot.
Just like you can compel people
to do things against their will.
Sometime, Kevin,
you say the craziest things.
I guess that's why I like you.
Oh, my goodness!
That must be Bobby.
Everybody,
look like you're having fun.
Hey, Tess.
Bobby?
It's about time, Bobby.
Tess was worried.
She was afraid
you weren't going to show up, Bobby.
Where you been?
I'm sorry. I had some car trouble.
Well, you're here now.
- That's all that matters.
- What are you doing?
Bobby is gonna help you, Tess.
He's gonna make you
feel better.
I feel fine.
Believe me, you're not fine.
But that's okay.
I can make that all better.
All you have to do
is take my hands.
- It's real easy.
- No. Don't touch me.
You're not Bobby.
You two are playing a joke on me.
A horrible, nasty joke.
You're right, I'm not Bobby,
but I really am here to help you, Tess.
You're sick, Tess.
Shawn is a healer.
There's nothing wrong with me.
Stop saying there is.
- Listen to me.
- No. Gloria needs a partner.
- Tess, listen to me.
- No talking. Just dancing.
And you...
You're not my friend anymore.
You're mean.
I hate you.
Why are you still her, Kyle?
Isabelle needs you.
I promised Jordan.
Jordan is wrong.
Don't look so surprised.
Even Messiahs
make mistakes sometimes.
Do you know
where Richard took her?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I'll be right with you.
I just have
to get this thought down.
Seems like you've had
a lot of those lately, Mr. Ancelet.
It's my autobiography.
You must have had a busy life.
I'm about to start on fourth grade.
What are we talking about here?
Some kind of total recall?
That's right.
I remember
people, events,
dreams, thoughts even.
If I experienced, I remember it.
All of it.
- You're writing it all down.
- Only thing that keeps me sane.
Otherwise, it just...
builds up in my head, until it feels
like my brain is gonna explode.
Mr. Ancelet,
you know why we're here?
- Richard Tyler.
- Do you know where he is?
I know he's my friend.
I understand.
Friendship's important.
But, Mike,
aiding and abetting a fugitive?
A 4400?
That's a...
That's a prison sentence.
And in that prison,
you're not gonna get computers,
or pens, or paper.
It'll just be you.
Alone...
with your thoughts.
Where are you?
How's that soup?
I like the noodles.
That boy?
The one at the center.
The one I liked so much?
What was his name again?
Shawn Farrell.
I was mean to him...
Wasn't I?
I'm having a hard
time remembering things.
That's okay.
We'll make new memories.
Better ones.
All it takes is...
one big sip,
then we're done.
And then what?
I won't be me anymore.
It'll be like I never existed.
If your mother were here,
she'd want us to do this.
She'd want us to be
a family again.
Be together.
Stay here.
What did you do to her?
It's a 4400 ability.
He wants to turn me
into a baby again.
Richar, this is crazy.
You have to stop this.
This is between me and my daughter.
It has nothing to do with you.
Daddy, don't.
Kyle is my friend.
He's the first person
who ever believed in me,
believes that I could change.
She's not
the same person you knew.
If you'd spent more time
in Promise City,
you'd have seen that.
Come on, Isabelle.
Where do you think
you're going?
Away from here.
We'll fix this, okay?
I promise you.
Can I talk to you for a second?
It's about Bobby.
He's here.
No, he's not.
Yes, he is.
He's right over there.
That's just Kevin.
Hey, Bobby loves you, right?
He's always there for you.
He'd do anything
to make you happy.
Yes, he would.
Then I'm telling yoy, that's Bobby.
Go over to him.
Look into his eyes.
See for yourself.
Bobby?
Is that really you?
I've been waiting for you
a long time.
Well, I'm here now.
Promise
you'll never leave me again.
I promise.
I'm so tired.
I know you are.
Shawn can help.
He can make you feel better.
Would you like that?
That would be nice.
You ready?
Kevin?
I was so scared.
And sick.
I hurt these people, didn't I?
It's all right.
You're better now.
And you're going to be
better from now on.
I'm so sorry.
We should go.
Wait.
They're not gonna remember
any of this, right?
Not if I don't want them to.
Backup's five minutes out.
We should go in now.
- What?
- If we go in hot,
we'll be forcing Richard
to fight back.
And you was what he did to
the guardsmen outside Promise City.
You really think
you can talk him down?
It's worth a try.
I'm not gonna hurt him, Isabelle.
You have my word.
Richard.
Look, it's over, all right?
Dad?
We have to go, Isabelle.
Oh, boy.
You okay?
- Kyle?
- Yeah.
Diana, do me a favor,
make sure
everyone's okay out there.
And stall them
as long as you can, okay?
I'll see what I can do.
Where's your car?
- Out back.
- Come on.
NTAC doesn't know you're here.
This way.
But I'd stay off
the main roads just to be safe.
You're letting me go?
Yeah, it looks that way.
You going to be able
to get back to Promise City?
I got out, didn't I?
Thanks, dad.
Okay, go. Just go.
Promise City?
That's the last place
I'd want to live.
I thought that you and Jordan
were close.
Not anymore.
He scares me.
He always has.
Yeah, this messiah
complex he's developed.
Very disturbing.
And all this talk
about heaven and Earth,
frankly, I don't buy it.
You guys can stay
here as long as you like.
Well, that would be wonderful,
but we're fugitives.
If they track us here,
you could be in a lot of trouble.
That's a risk iI'm willing to take.
You can use
our medical facilities
to continue your research.
Find a way to make promicin safer.
Tell him, Kevin.
What?
It's really only
a theory at this point.
Well, I'd like to hear it.
Well, I'm putting together profiles
of the people
who have taken the shot,
the ones we know of anyway,
to see if I could discover
why some survive
and others don't.
And the initial research
is promising.
Pretty soon, Kevin thinks
he'll be able to predict
who will survive the shot
and who won't.
And if people know for certain
that promicin will kill them,
they won't take the shot.
And a lot less people would die.
Isabelle, did you hear
what I said to you?
You don't have to drink the rest of it
if you don't want to.
And if I don't, then what?
I start my life over
again as an eight-year-old?
We could go see Cora.
Maybe she could reverse
the process.
Age you back
to where you were.
That boy, Kyle,
risked his life to come find you.
Someone cares
that much about you.
It says a lot about him.
And about you.
Maybe you have changed.
Maybe you're a different person now.
But you still want me to drink it,
don't you?
I just want us to have
more perfect days, Isabelle.
But like I said,
it's up to you now.
I'm scared.
I'm right here.
You know iI had him?
He was standing right there
in front of me, and I let him go.
What else could you do,
arrest him?
I thought if I ever
got him out of Promise City,
that's exactly
what I would have done.
Or if I didn't want
to bring him into NTAC,
at least I would've
brought him back here
until I figured out a next step.
And what would you have done?
Locked Kyle in his bedroom?
He would've taken off the moment
you'd turn your back.
Tom, you had a choice
between Promise City and prison.
If it was my kid,
I would've done exactly the same thing.
Am I making you
feel any better at all?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Thank, by the way, for...
for coming over here
and letting me ramble.
Sure.
We're friend, right?
Yeah.
Friends.
Okay, we're good friends.
Good friends.
- What?
- I felt something behind your ear.
- What?
- Turn around. Show me.
Your mole is back.
Daddy!

<i>Tu n'es pas Lily.
Lily est morte.</i>
- Morte ?
- Tu es morte de vieillesse.
Non, tu te trompes.
Je...
Je suis bien là.
Je ne suis pas morte.
Où étais-tu ?
Comment es-tu arrivée ici ?
Je me suis réveillée,
il y a à peu près une heure.
Je ne savais pas où j'étais.
Pas vraiment, mais...
je savais
que tu rentrerais bientôt,
et que tu serais avec Isabelle.
Tout ce dont je me souviens,
c'est que...
je la cherchais, au Centre.
Elle n'était pas dans son berceau.
- Tu as changé, Richard. Tu es triste.
- Tu n'es pas réelle.
Tu n'arrêtes pas de dire ça,
mais je me sens bien réelle.
Je me souviens
des moindres détails de ma vie,
de notre relation.
Je peux prendre des objets.
Je peux les toucher...
Te toucher.
Tu ressens quelque chose, non ?
Je ne sais pas où j'étais,
Richard,
ni comment je suis arrivée ici,
mais...
Je ne cherche pas non plus
à le savoir.
Je suis là.
N'est-ce pas suffisant ?
<i>Je peux te poser une question ?</i>
Bien sûr.
Tu es gaucher.
Évidemment.
- Et cette question ?
- Tu as déjà répondu.
J'étudie les rapports
sur ceux qui ont survécu
ou non à la promicine.
Savais-tu...
que neuf gauchers sur dix
qui ont pris une dose,
ont survécu ?
- Non.
- Eh bien, c'est vrai.
J'ai trouvé ça il y a deux semaines,
mais je ne savais pas...
ce que ça signifiait...
jusqu'à maintenant.
Regarde.
Dans le cerveau, se trouve une partie
appelée corps calleux.
C'est une sorte de faisceau de câbles
qui relie les deux hémisphères.
Couramment, il est un peu plus développé
chez les gauchers que les droitiers.
Voilà pourquoi
les gauchers survivent.
La taille de cette région du cerveau
va permettre de déterminer
si quelqu'un sera apte à assimiler
un nouveau neurotransmetteur ou non.
Quelle taille doit-elle avoir ?
Je n'en sais rien...
pour l'instant.
Mais je pense pouvoir trouver.
Et si c'est le cas,
un simple scanner
nous permettra de prédire
comment quiconque
réagirait à une dose.
Et on saurait tout de suite
si la dose serait mortelle ou non.
Les doses ne feraient plus de victimes.
De combien de temps
as-tu besoin ?
Un mois ou deux,
peut-être moins.
C'est génial.
Continue. Je te fournirai
tout ce dont tu as besoin.
- Où vas-tu ?
- Il faut que je rencontre Collier.
Si ce diagnostic est réalisable
d'ici quelques mois,
il lui suffit de faire
une annonce publique,
demandant à ceux
qui pensaient prendre une dose...
d'attendre, tout simplement.
C'est fantastique.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais,
planté au milieu du couloir ?
Tout va bien ?
Oui, ça... ça va.
C'est juste...
une matinée étrange.
Bienvenue au club.
On a une visite surprise
de Rebecca Parrish.
Certains appelleraient ça un piège.
La directrice renseignement national
est ici ?
Elle est dans le bureau de Meghan
depuis 20 minutes, et ce n'est pas tout.
Elle a demandé à <i>nous</i> voir.
Ne la faisons pas attendre.
Bonjour, agent Baldwin,
agent Skouris.
Je suis Rebecca Parrish,
c'est un plaisir de vous rencontrer.
Tout le plaisir est pour nous.
Je sais que votre travail au NTAC
n'est pas de tout repos.
Mais dernièrement,
il semble que nous n'avons reçu
que de mauvaises nouvelles
de Seattle.
La promicine
a de plus en plus d'adeptes.
La création de la Ville Promise
est un échec cuisant pour cette agence,
et notre administration.
C'est temporaire.
Nous arrêterons...
Collier, et fermerons cet endroit.
J'apprécie votre attitude, mais veuillez
m'excuser si je ne suis pas rassurée.
Parce que récemment,
il semble que...
la moindre des affaires
est bâclée.
Richard Tyler et sa fille étaient
encerclés, et inférieurs en nombre.
La situation était maîtrisée,
et nous les avons perdus malgré cela.
Sauf votre respect,
j'étais présente, et la situation
était loin d'être "maîtrisée".
Richard Tyler est devenu
un homme extrêmement puissant.
Je comprends,
mais nous ne pouvons pas
abandonner pour autant, non ?
Dans deux semaines,
on m'a demandé de témoigner
face à un comité du Congrès
pour rendre compte des progrès
de l'éradication de la promicine.
Je serai ici toute la semaine
pour me préparer,
et j'aimerais pouvoir
rendre compte d'une victoire.
Donc, vous voulez
que l'on ramène Richard.
Mme Parrish a demandé
à rencontrer mes meilleurs agents...
Vous êtes donc là.
Vous allez également diriger une équipe
afin de retrouver les Tyler.
Je surveillerais personnellement
les progrès.
Je suis certaine
que cela ne posera pas de problème.
Agent Baldwin ?
Vous vouliez ajouter
quelque chose ?
Je...
suis sûre que Tom souhaite
se mettre au travail.
Nous allons retrouver les Tyler.
Je ne sais pas
ce qui m'arrive, Diana.
J'ai comme des visions de mon futur,
mais ce n'est pas moi.
Je fais des choses
dont je suis incapable.
Si ce n'étaient pas des rêves ?
Que ce soient
les souvenirs d'un autre ?
S'ils m'avaient réellement
injecté quelque chose à l'hôpital ?
Et que ça commence
à m'influencer ?
Je deviens un de ces Marqués.
Écoute,
même si tu as raison,
ce n'est pas encore arrivé.
Tu n'as pas changé.
- Il faut te battre.
- Comment ?
As-tu au moins vu un docteur
depuis que ces rêves ont commencé ?
- Non.
- Bon, tu devrais commencer par ça.
Trouve-toi un médecin privé
et fais-toi examiner.
On est censés rechercher Richard.
Vas-y.
Je te couvre.
Vas-y.
C'est bon.
Elle a l'air tellement plus âgée.
Combien de temps suis-je partie ?
Un petit moment.
Plus d'un an.
Dis-moi ce qui s'est passé.
Je veux tout savoir.
Pourquoi as-tu l'air si triste ?
Je t'ai enterrée, Lily.
Je t'ai pleurée.
Je n'aurais jamais pensé
me retrouver à tes côtés,
et je ne veux pas perdre le temps
qu'il nous reste en explications.
On a tout le temps
qu'il nous faut, pourtant.
Pourquoi serait-ce autrement ?
Tu n'arrives toujours pas à croire
que je suis réelle, c'est ça ?
Je ne sais pas.
Si je décide de le croire,
et qu'il s'avère que j'ai tort...
Je ne sais pas
si je pourrai vivre avec.
On va essayer, d'accord ?
On va rester allongés ici
un moment...
et si, quand tu te réveilles,
je suis toujours là...
alors, tout cela est vrai.
- Tu as gardé ces photos de nous deux.
- Bien sûr que oui.
Qui est-ce ?
C'est une amie.
Elle a vécu au Centre
après ton départ.
Elle est jolie.
Et elle a l'air gentille.
Je comprends pourquoi tu as gardé
cette photo.
J'en sais rien.
Rien n'a changé chez moi, Diana.
J'ai passé tous les examens possibles.
Ils disent tous
que je suis en parfaite santé.
Je te rappelle.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Désolée pour l'intrusion.
Je suis très méticuleuse
quand il s'agit de sécurité.
C'est essentiel.
L'administration a des ennemis
- partout, de nos jours.
- Que faites-vous là, Mlle Parrish ?
Je voulais vous parler, en privé.
Messieurs...
Messieurs, laissez-nous seuls.
Merci.
Nom de Dieu, c'est chez moi !
Je vais être franche avec vous.
J'ai été préoccupée par votre...
comportement
dans le bureau de Mlle Doyle, ce matin.
Pensez-vous être capable d'assurer
la traque de Richard Tyler ?
- Je vais bien.
- Ravie de l'entendre.
Je vais peut-être vous surprendre,
mais je crois savoir
ce que vous traversez.
Juste après avoir commencé ce job,
j'ai cru être au bord de la dépression,
moi aussi.
J'étais submergée de travail,
et j'avais...
par moments,
ces étranges hallucinations.
C'était presque comme si
je n'étais plus moi-même,
comme si...
quelqu'un d'autre était dans ma tête.
Vous me comprenez ?
Je crois que oui.
Laissez-moi vous poser une question.
Si je regarde derrière votre oreille,
j'y trouverai une marque ?
Une marque ?
Une sorte de tache ?
Difficile à dire.
Passé 40 ans,
votre peau
n'arrête pas de se transformer.
J'étais très nerveuse à cette époque.
Je pensais que j'étais perdue.
Je me suis battue.
Mon Dieu, si vous saviez à quel point.
Et un jour,
j'ai abandonné.
J'ai cédé.
J'ai accepté ma situation.
Et vous savez quoi ?
Tout va beaucoup mieux, depuis.
Je suis plus heureuse.
Mes amis me disent
que je suis transformée.
Vous devriez vous détendre, Tom.
Quoique vous traversiez,
contentez-vous...
de laisser faire.
Vous vous sentirez mieux.
Je vous le promets.
Vous me dites que Rebecca Parrish
est l'une d'entre eux ?
- Qu'elle est marquée ?
- Oui, je pense.
Elle ne l'a pas dit clairement.
Mais vous n'avez plus d'hallucinations,
alors, peut-être
qu'elle parlait d'autre chose.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Je pense que c'est du délire,
et qu'on pourra pas prouver
quoi que ce soit, mais...
Je suis Tom sur ce coup.
Je pense qu'il est probable
que la Directrice des renseignements
soit marquée.
Il va falloir être très prudents.
Le NTAC est censé rechercher
Richard Tyler,
alors, on va continuer.
Je transmets le dossier
à Garrity et Ashmore.
Tom, vous prenez votre journée, demain.
Diana et moi
allons vous surveiller.
Chacune son tour.
Shawn, tu me demandes
de dire à la population
d'éviter la promicine ?
Juste pour quelques mois.
Jordan, je sais qu'on a pas
toujours été d'accord par le passé,
mais on a tous à y gagner.
Il faut juste être patients.
Ce n'est pas d'attendre
qui m'inquiète.
Ce sont les implications mondiales
de ce test.
Shawn, des millions de personnes
auront une aptitude
et d'autres n'auront aucune chance
d'en acquérir.
Oui, mais ils seront vivants.
Et vivront dans un monde
divisé en deux.
Les positifs et les négatifs
ne peuvent pas coexister.
Ceux sans aptitudes détruiront
ceux qui en ont.
Ou alors,
les positifs utiliseront leur capacité
pour se débarrasser des négatifs.
Inquisition, ou génocide.
Dans tous les cas,
ce sera l'enfer sur Terre.
Quelle alternative ?
Tu veux vraiment que
- tout le monde prenne de la promicine ?
- Oui.
J'ai toujours dit que
c'est ce qui devait se passer.
La moitié de la planète mourra !
- C'est du suicide à grande échelle !
- Je te parle...
du sacrifice
d'une <i>seule</i> génération.
Et au bout du compte,
d'une espèce
qui aura évolué pleinement.
Toutes les erreurs commises
par les humains
seront oubliées
quand nous aurons tous une aptitude.
Je ne ferai pas de déclaration.
Et personne, se souciant du bien
de l'humanité, ne le ferait.
Qu'est-ce que tu as grandi !
Et tu pèses plus lourd !
Ouais.
- Un seul.
- Je vais jouer.
Très bien, va jouer.
Elle a vraiment l'air heureuse.
Les petits ne sont pas censés
être grincheux parfois ?
Isabelle l'a été... crois-moi.
J'en suis sûre.
Depuis que je suis revenue, je...
je pense à ce que
ça a dû être pour toi,
de l'élever tout seul.
Aucun de nous n'a demandé
à être parent,
et c'est quand même merveilleux,
mais...
ça nous est un peu tombé dessus.
Mais tu as toujours été là pour elle,
même pendant mon absence.
Tu es un père génial, Richard.
Il n'y a qu'à la regarder
pour le savoir.
<i>Ma capacité agit bien sur Richard Tyler.</i>
<i>Il voit sa femme décédée,</i>
mais j'ignore s'il parle
de ce qu'il a fait à sa fille.
Il la voit grâce à moi,
mais la discussion dépend de lui.
Très bien, continue.
On n'a pas d'autre choix pour le moment.
Je sais pas
si je vais pouvoir tenir longtemps.
Écoute, je sais que tu es fatigué,
mais c'est vraiment important.
J'oublierai pas
ce que t'as fait pour moi.
- Je peux avoir un café ?
- Bien sûr.
Bien sûr.
Ça marche.
Mais il nous faut plus de temps.
Si tu sais où se trouve Isabelle,
dis-le-moi. Je peux l'aider moi-même.
Ça s'est pas très bien fini
la dernière fois que tu as essayé.
Il est trop tôt pour ça.
Richard n'est pas prêt à abandonner.
C'est juste la première partie du plan
pour la récupérer.
Quand on sera prêts pour la suite,
je te le dirai.
Ou tu pourrais
me le dire tout de suite.
Vous saviez qu'il fréquentait
sa grand-mère ?
Pourquoi croyez-vous
qu'on les a choisis ?
Une fois qu'on les aura renvoyés
à leur époque, ils se trouveront.
Ils créeront un lien.
C'est fait.
Elle est enceinte.
Chérie...
Chérie, Meghan.
Chérie, réveille-toi.
J'ai refait le même rêve.
Bien sûr que oui, Tom.
Vous devenez votre nouveau vous.
Vous êtes l'un des nôtres,
maintenant.
Bienvenue à bord.
Tu as refait le rêve ?
Non, j'ai dormi comme un bébé.
Je me sens très bien.
J'avais oublié
combien je détestais cet endroit.
Il y a tellement de bruit
à cette époque.
Tellement de monde.
Regardez-les.
Ils n'ont aucune idée
de ce qui les attend.
Ils ne font que passer
d'une occupation inutile à une autre.
C'est répugnant.
Je pensais que vous seriez content
d'être en vie.
On vous a donné une chance
de continuer votre mission.
Celle que j'ai complètement foirée ?
Celle qui a causé la mort
de mon hôte précédent ?
Ne rejetez pas vos erreurs
sur Matthew Ross.
Nous sommes nos hôtes.
Votre incapacité à maîtriser
Isabelle Tyler a causé votre perte.
Je ferai mieux cette fois-ci.
Vous devez vous remettre au travail.
Les convaincre
de vous remettre en service actif.
Je tirerai quelques ficelles
si besoin est,
mais mieux vaut vous en occuper
vous-même.
- Et ensuite ?
- Facile.
Vous agissez comme Tom Baldwin.
Vous trouvez Isabelle Tyler.
Je vous contacterai.
Richard, viens jouer.
Je peux pas.
Lily, j'ai quelque chose à te dire.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, mon coeur ?
Je t'ai menti.
La photo que tu as vue.
La jolie fille.
C'était Isabelle.
Mon Dieu, Richard. J'ignorais que
les choses avaient si mal tourné.
Je ne te demande pas de me pardonner,
mais j'ai besoin que tu comprennes.
J'ai fait ça pour notre fille.
Pourquoi tu ne m'as pas dit la vérité
dès le début ?
J'étais heureux,
ces derniers jours, avec toi.
Ça fait si longtemps
que je n'ai pas ressenti ça.
Un bon père ferait tout
pour son enfant,
et tu es un bon père.
Mais, Richard...
Tu lui as pris sa vie.
Le bon et le mauvais.
Tu as effacé ce qu'elle était,
ce qu'elle aurait pu être.
J'ai su après coup
que j'avais eu tort, mais...
D'autres m'avaient prévenu,
mais je ne les ai pas écoutés.
Tu es la seule
que j'aurais pu écouter.
Papa...
Je me sens réelle.
Nous parlons.
- J'ai tenu Isabelle.
- Non.
Ma capacité te l'a fait croire.
Je ne sais pas si je te vois
car je le veux,
ou si quelqu'un te fait
apparaître par magie.
Richard, je ne sais pas
comment je suis arrivée ici,
mais ça n'a peut-être pas
d'importance.
Je ne vais pouvoir rester
bien longtemps.
Mais si je dois disparaître,
me prendrais-tu dans tes bras ?
Je t'aime, Richard.
Je ne dis pas que tout va bien,
mais il n'est rien arrivé cette nuit
et ce matin,
Tom a dit qu'il allait bien.
Il voulait pas que je vienne le voir,
mais où est-il ?
Tom est toujours là à l'aube.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a, Tom ?
Il vient de traîner Marco
hors de son bureau.
Je crois que Baldwin est en train
de perdre la boule.
Ton esprit ne peut rien
contre la puissance de mon esprit.
Tu es sous mon emprise.
Mon esprit ne peut rien
contre la puissance de ton esprit.
Je suis sous ton emprise.
Une emprise totale.
Une emprise totale.
Si tu voyais leur tête.
Désolé, Di, on essayait juste
de détendre l'atmosphère.
- C'est tout.
- Bande d'idiots !
Marco, tu es viré.
Toi aussi, Garrity.
- Allez, elle est connue !
- Interdit de nous virer pour ça.
Retournez travailler
et trouvez quelque chose.
- Allez...
- Vite.
Je suis désolé.
Bien joué.
Aucun sens de l'humour, ici.
Quoi ?
Vous savez quoi ?
Sérieusement,
je veux vous remercier
pour m'avoir aidé à surmonter
ces derniers jours,
mais après une bonne nuit
de sommeil. Je me sens...
mieux et j'espère
que tout ça est terminé.
Si j'ai d'autres flashs,
je vous mets au courant,
mais en attendant, j'aimerais
vraiment retourner travailler.
Et pour Rebecca Parrish ?
Gardons un oeil sur elle.
Son intrusion chez moi était...
vraiment bizarre.
Mais vous aviez peut-être raison.
Peut-être...
que c'était sa façon
de m'encourager.
Quoi qu'il en soit,
pas besoin de lui faire confiance
pour faire mon boulot,
et je veux vraiment
faire mon boulot.
D'accord,
mais je vous ai à l'oeil, OK ?
À la prochaine tentative
de contrôle d'esprit... dehors.
C'était pas drôle.
J'ai un très simple message
pour ceux qui envisagent
de prendre une dose.
Attendez.
Dans quelques mois, les recherches
que je finance seront finies,
et le 50-50
sera de l'histoire ancienne.
Nous aurons un test très simple
permettant de dire
si vous survivrez ou non...
Plus personne
ne devra risquer sa vie.
Qu'en dit Jordan Collier ?
Est-il favorable ?
Vous lui demanderez
vous-même, Paul,
mais il s'agit d'éviter
des milliers de morts inutiles.
Je ne vois pas qui pourrait le voir
comme une mauvaise chose.
Tu l'as fait à ton propre enfant.
Tu me déçois, Richard.
Tu m'as dit que tu utiliserais
l'eau que je t'ai donnée
pour aider
un ancien copain militaire.
Je sais que j'ai eu tort.
Mais tu ne me l'aurais jamais donnée
- si tu savais ce que je voulais faire.
- Tu as raison.
Ces capacités que nous avons,
ce sont des dons de Dieu,
et nous devons les traiter
avec respect.
Je sais,
et c'est pour ça que je suis là.
J'espérais que tu pourrais
arranger les choses.
Cora, je t'en prie.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Je verrai ce que je peux faire.
<i>Byron, réveille-toi.
Byron...
Isabelle a besoin de toi...
Laisse-le dormir.
Il a fait ce qu'il avait à faire.
Ça veut dire qu'Isabelle va bien ?
Pas exactement,
mais on s'en rapproche.
Il faut que tu appelles ton père.
Mon père ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu dois lui dire
où se trouve Isabelle.
Tu veux que je la livre
au gouvernement ?
Si tu sais où elle est,
dis-le-moi.
- J'irai moi-même.
- Ça doit se passer ainsi.
Je te promets, Kyle,
si tu fais exactement
ce que je dis,
Isabelle ne finira pas en prison.
Pense à tout ce
que nous avons fait, Kyle.
Tout que nous avons accompli ensemble.
Tu vas vraiment commencer
à douter de moi ?
Ça a marché ?
Papa...
Tu sors ?
On a reçu un tuyau sur Tyler.
Un appel venant de la Ville Promise,
indiquant le nom
et l'adresse d'une 4400
que Richard prétend avoir rencontrée.
Un appel anonyme, sûrement rien.
Tu avais rendez-vous
à l'école de Maia.
J'allais y aller pendant ce temps.
J'en reviens alors je t'accompagne.
Je prends mon manteau.
OK, parfait.
Tu as vu ?
Le rideau vient de bouger.
Alors, quelqu'un sait
que nous sommes là.
Ton tuyau disait que cette dame
est juste une associée de Tyler, non ?
Oui, restons prudents.
Toque à la porte.
Je fais le tour
pour m'assurer que personne
ne déguerpit.
Richard, une voiture vient
de se garer là dehors.
Des gens viennent.
Isabelle, descends à la cave.
Si tu entends quelque chose,
file par derrière, OK ?
Va répondre à la porte.
Essaye de te débarrasser d'eux.
Cora Tomkins ?
Bonjour. Je suis Diana Skouris.
NTAC.
J'ai quelques questions à vous poser
au sujet de Richard Tyler.
Richard Tyler ?
Je ne l'ai pas vu
depuis la quarantaine.
Ça vous dérange si j'entre ?
Donc Richard n'a pas essayé
de vous joindre du tout ?
Aucun appel ?
Aucun email ?
Non, mais je suis un peu coupée
du monde.
Bien sûr.
Oh, désolée. Je ne savais pas
que j'interrompais quelque chose.
- Vous avez de la compagnie.
- Non, non.
Excusez le fatras.
J'ai du mal à ranger
les affaires à leur place.
Comme je disais, je l'ai connu
en quarantaine,
mais je n'ai que peu de contacts
avec les 4400.
- Vous n'abandonnez jamais.
- Ne bougez pas.
Ça va ?
Que leur avez-vous fait ?
Diana...
Ça va ?
Oui, je crois.
Désolé.
J'ai fait le tour,
et Isabelle était déjà trop loin
à mon arrivée.
J'allais la poursuivre
mais je suis revenu quand
j'ai entendu les coups de feu.
Où est-elle maintenant ?
Je ne sais pas Diana,
elle s'est enfuie.
<i>Bien joué.</i>
Aujourd'hui,
les agents Baldwin et Skouris
ont montré exactement ce qu'il
nous faut pour gagner ce combat.
De l'initiative,
du savoir-faire,
et une collaboration exemplaire.
L'arrestation de Richard Tyler
est une grande victoire pour nous,
un rappel à tous
que la loi prévaut toujours
dans ce pays.
Ne vous y trompez pas,
le chemin est encore long,
mais aujourd'hui...
Aujourd'hui, nous avons gagné.
Joli discours.
Oui. Exactement ce que dirait
Parrish si c'était une Marquée.
Et exactement ce que Parrish dirait
si ce n'était pas une Marquée.
Je sais, de toute façon,
elle a gagné aujourd'hui.
Joli travail.
Je vais faire bonne figure.
Ça...
- Ça va aller ?
- Oui.
Certaine ?
On a eu de la chance aujourd'hui
de trouver Richard dans cette maison.
Heureusement
que tu as eu ce tuyau.
Oui. Il faut bien qu'on ait
de la chance parfois, non ?
Ça ne devait pas se finir comme ça !
Richard est en prison !
On en parle partout !
Isabelle est en cavale
avec le gouvernement à ses trousses.
Tu as dit qu'elle irait bien.
Tu m'as menti !
Je t'ai promis
qu'elle ne finirait pas en prison.
- Elle n'est pas en prison.
- Ni en sécurité.
- Ce n'est pas ce que je voulais...
- Peu importe ce que tu veux !
Ce qui compte,
c'est ce qui doit arriver !
Je ne suis pas ton assistante.
Je suis pas là
pour faire tes courses,
mais pour te dire
comment aider le mouvement.
Pour le moment,
il faut que tu sois fort,
parce que ta prochaine action,
crois-moi,
ça ne sera pas une partie de plaisir.
- De quoi parles-tu ?
- Ton cousin, Shawn ?
Ses travaux avec ce scientifique
mettent en péril
le mouvement entier.
Collier est au courant,
mais il a trop peur
de se salir les mains.
Il ne devrait pas avoir
à se salir les mains.
C'est pour ça
qu'il a des gens comme toi.
Des gens comme moi ?
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Il faut arrêter Shawn Farrell.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Tu es en sécurité.
- Où suis-je ?
- Chez moi.
Je t'ai donné un tranquillisant
et t'ai amenée ici.
- Où est mon père ?
- Il est sous inhibiteur.
Il est en prison
- et il va y rester un bon moment.
- Il n'a rien fait de mal.
Il voulait juste m'aider...
Isabelle, tout va bien.
Il y a moyen de le faire sortir.
Je connais des gens
qui en ont les moyens.
Rien de plus simple.
Il ne suffit que d'une chose.
Tu...
dois recouvrer ta capacité.
Ainsi, tu pourras
me livrer Jordan Collier.

The world will have to

<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...
Jordan, you've done
great things for the 4400,
but you are on
the wrong path here.
And you've always
been rebellious.
But I think
you're afraid of change, Shawn.
Or is it just me?
I'm shrinking.
What did you do to me?
I met Cora.
She has an amazing ability.
She can actually
make people younger.
- Isabelle?
- Daddy!
If your mother were here,
she'd want us to do this.
She'd want us to be
a family again.
When your wife fainted
this morning,
she was a young woman.
When she woke up
less than a minute later,
she was 50 years older?
Richard, I'm dying.
There's a faction of elites
who want the future
to stay exactly as it is.
I call them "The Marked."
When we need him...
he'll be there for us.
Mr. Tyler,
can you hear my voice?
He's been under
for almost 20 minutes.
We should have begun
the procedure already.
Where have you been?
Who are you?
We have to work fast.
This is our only chance.
I've practiced enough...
with plenty of time.
Tonight, Richard Tyler
becomes a father.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just had a... weird dream.
You wanna talk about it?
No, I'm okay.
You should go back to bed.
I'll be right there.
Ready, you're ready ?
Daddy loves you.
It's nice to see you happy,
sweetheart.
Daddy's been wanting that
for long time.
Who are you?
Who am I?
I'm Lily... your wife.
Who else would I be?

<i>You're not lily.
Lily is dead.</i>
- Dead?
- You got old. You passed on.
No, you're wrong.
I'm...
I'm right here.
I didn't die.
Where have you been?
How did you get here?
Well, I woke up
about an hour ago. I...
I wasn't sure where I was.
Not exactly, but...
Somehow knew
you'd be home soon,
and you'd have Isabelle.
That's the last thing I remember.
I was...
I was looking for her at the Center,
and she wasn't in her crib.
You look different, Richard.
You look sad.
- You are not real.
- You keep saying that, but I feel real.
I mean I remember
everything about my life,
about us.
I can pick things up.
I can touch things.
You.
You can feel that, right?
I can't explain
where I've been, Richard,
or how I got here, but...
I'm not questioning it, either.
I'm here.
Isn't that enough?
<i>Can I ask you
a question?
Sure.
You're left-handed.
Of course.
- Is there a question coming?
- You already answered it.
I've been studying the reports
on who survives the promicin shot,
and who doesn't.
Did you know
nine out of ten
left-handed people
who take the shot,
survive?
- No, I didn't.
- Well, it's true.
I learned that a couple weeks ago,
but I didn't know...
what it meant...
until now.
There.
There's a small part of the brain
called the corpus callosum.
It's like a bundle of wires
that connects the two hemispheres.
It's usually slightly larger
in lefties than it is in righties.
That's why the lefties survive.
The size of that part of the brain
helps determine whether or not
you'll be able to integrate
a new neurotransmitter.
Well, how big
does it have to be?
I don't know... yet.
But I think I can figure it out.
And if I do...
A simple cat scan will tell me
how anyone's body
will react to the shot.
And you'd know in advance
whether or not you'd live or die.
The shot wouldn't have to
kill anyone anymore.
How long do you need?
A couple of months,
maybe less.
This is huge.
Keep working.
I'll get you anything you need, okay?
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get in contact with Collier.
If this test is really
only a few months away,
all he has to do
is make an announcement,
telling people that are
thinking about taking the shot
to simply wait.
This is great.
Hey, Tom.
What are you doing standing
in the middle of the hallway?
Is everything all right?
Yeah, I'm... fine.
I've just...
had a strange morning.
Well, join the club.
We've just had a surprise visit
from Rebecca Parrish.
Some might say an ambush.
The director of national
intelligence is here?
She's been in Meghan's office
the past 20 minutes, and that's not all.
She's asked to see us.
I don't think she likes to wait.
Morning, agent Baldwin,
agent Skouris.
I'm Rebecca Parrish,
and it is a pleasure to meet you.
The pleasure's all ours.
I know that you have difficult jobs
here at NTAC.
But lately,
it seems that we've had
nothing but bad news
coming out of Seattle.
Promicin use is growing.
The founding of Promise City
was a major defeat for this agency,
and in the administration.
It's temporary.
We'll arrest...
Collier,
and we'll shut that place down.
I like your attitude,
but you'll forgive me
if I'm not reassured.
Because recently,
it seems like we're...
even botching the little things.
We had Richard Tyler and his daughter
surrounded, outnumbered.
The situation was in hand,
and we lost him anyway.
Well, with all
due respect,
I was there, and that situation
was anything but "in hand."
Richard Tyler has become
an extremely powerful man.
I understand,
but we can't simply just
throw our hands up,
now, can we?
In two weeks,
I'm being asked to testify
before a congressional subcommittee
on the progress of the war
against promicin.
I'll be here for the entire week
to prepare,
and I would like to go back
with a victory.
So, you want us
to bring in Richard.
Ms. Parrish asked to meet
my two best agents.
That's why you're here.
That's also why you're heading up
a task force to find the Tylers.
I will be checking in
on your progress.
I trust this won't be a problem.
Agent Baldwin?
Did you have something
you needed to say?
I'm...
sure Tom just wants
to get to work.
We'll find the Tylers for you.
I don't know
what's happening, Diana.
It's like I'm seeing myself
in the future, only it's not me.
I'm doing things
I would never do.
What if
they're not just dreams?
What if
they're someone else's memories?
What if they really did put something
inside me when I was in that hospital?
What if it's starting
to affect me?
I'm becoming
one of the marked.
Listen,
Even if you're right,
it hasn't happened yet.
You're still you.
- Okay, so we can fight it.
- How?
Well, have you been to see a doctor
since these dreams began?
- No.
- Okay, well, why don't you start there?
Go find yourself a private physician,
get yourself checked out.
We're supposed to be
looking for Richard.
Just go.
Go.
I'll cover for you.
Go.
Okay.
She looks so much older.
How long
have I been gone?
A little while.
More than a year.
Tell me what happened.
I want to hear it all.
Why do you look so sad?
I buried you, Lily.
I mourned you.
I never imagined
I'd be sitting beside you again,
and I don't wanna waste
the time we have with explanations.
We have all the time
in the world, though.
Why wouldn't we?
You still don't believe
I'm real, do you?
I don't know.
If I let myself believe it,
and I turn out to be wrong...
I'm not sure
I could live with that.
Let's just see, okay?
We'll just lay here
for a while...
and if I'm still beside you
when we wake up...
I guess we're real.
- You saved these pictures of us.
- Of course I did.
Who's this?
She's a friend of mine.
She lived at the 4400 Center
after you were gone.
She's pretty.
She looks nice, too.
I can see why
you saved the picture.
I don't know.
There's nothing different
about me, Diana.
I had every test
they could give me.
They all say
I'm in perfect health.
I'll call you back.
- What's going on?
- Sorry for the intrusion.
My security detail
is nothing if not thorough.
They have to be.
The administration has enemies
- everywhere these days.
- What are you doing here, Ms. Parrish?
I wanted to have
a word with you in private.
Gentlemen...
Gentlemen, agent Baldwin and I
need the room.
Thank you.
Damn it, this is my house...
I'm going to pay you
the respect of being frank.
I was a little concerned
with your...
outburst in Ms. Doyle's office
this morning.
Are you quite sure you're up to the job
of tracking down Richard Tyler?
- I'm fine.
- That's good to hear.
This might surprise you,
but I think I have an idea
of what you're going through.
Right after I took this job,
I felt like I was on the verge
of a breakdown myself.
I was overwhelmed at work,
and I was...
having these strange moments
where I was seeing things.
It was almost like
I wasn't myself.
Like... someone else
was in my head.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
I think I do.
Let me ask you something,
Ms. Parrish.
If I look behind your left ear,
would I find a mark there?
A mark?
You mean like a mole?
That's hard to say.
Once you turn 40,
your skin changes all the time.
I remember how nervous I was
in those days.
I thought I was going to
lose myself forever.
I fought it.
My God, how I fought it.
And then one day,
I just couldn't fight it
anymore.
I gave in.
I accepted my situation.
And you know what?
Things have been
much better for me since then.
I'm happier.
My friends tell me
that I'm like a new person.
You should relax, Tom.
Whatever you're going through,
just...
let it happen.
You'll feel better.
I promise.
You're saying Rebecca Parrish
is one of these people?
- She's marked?
- Yeah, I think so.
She never came out
and said it.
But you haven't had
any more hallucinations,
so, maybe she was talking
about something else.
What do you think?
I think it's crazy,
and I doubt we'll be able
to prove any of this, but...
I have to go with Tom.
I think that there's a very good chance
the director of national
intelligence is marked.
We're going to have to be very careful
with how we proceed.
NTAC would be looking for
Richard Tyler no matter what,
so we'll keep doing that.
I'm passing the case over
to Garrity and Ashmore.
Tom, you're taking
a personal day tomorrow.
Diana and I
will keep an eye on you.
We'll watch over you
in shifts.
I'm sorry, Shawn,
are you really asking me
to tell people
not to take promicin?
Only for a few months.
Jordan, I know that
we have had our differences in the past,
but this is good for both of us.
All we have to do is be patient.
It's not the need for patience
that concerns me.
It's the worldwide implications
of this test.
Shawn, there would be millions of people
with abilities
and millions without any chance
of having them.
Yes, but they would be alive.
And living in a world
with two classes of human being.
Positives and negatives
cannot live side by side.
Those without abilities
will tear down the ones who have them.
Or, the positives will simply
use their powers
to rid themselves
of the negatives.
Inquisition, or holocaust.
Either way, it's a recipe
for hell on earth.
What's your alternative?
Do you really want
- the entire world to take promicin?
- Yes.
Yes, I do. It's what I've always said
has to happen.
Half of the planet will die!
- You're talking about mass suicide!
- I am talking...
about a single generation
of sacrifice.
And at the end of it,
a more fully-evolved species.
All of our failings
as human beings
will be addressed
when we are all gifted.
I am not making
any announcement.
And no one who cares about
what's right for the world would.
Somebody got so big!
Oh, she got heavy, too.
Yeah.
- Just one, just one.
- I'm going to go play.
All right, go play.
She seems so happy.
Aren't toddlers
supposed to be moody?
Oh, Isabelle's had her moments,
believe me.
Oh, I'm sure she has.
Ever since I got back,
I've been...
thinking about what it must
have been like for you,
raising her on your own.
You know, neither of
us asked to be parents,
not that it makes it any less
wonderful, but still...
It just kind of happened.
But you've always been
there for her,
even while I was gone.
You're a great father, Richard.
You can tell
just by looking at her.
<i>I'm definitely using my ability
on Richard Tyler.</i>
<i>He's seeing his dead wife,</i>
but I have no idea
if they're talking about
what he did to his daughter.
I just make him see her.
Everything they talk
about comes from him.
Allright, keep at it.
We don't have any other
options at this point.
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.
Look, I know you're tired,
but this is very important.
I won't forget
what you did for me.
- Can I get a coffee or something?
- Absolutely.
Absolutely.
It's working.
We just need more time.
If you know where Isabelle is,
just tell me. I can help her myself.
Didn't really work out so well
the last time you tried it, did it?
It's too soon for that.
Richard's not ready to give her up yet.
This is just the first
part of a plan to get her back.
When we're ready for the next part,
I'll let you know.
Or you can tell me now.
Did you know he was involved
with her grandmother?
Why do you think
we picked these two?
After we send them back
to their time,
they'll find each other.
They'll form a bond.
It's done.
She's pregnant.
Honey...
Honey, Meghan.
Honey, wake up.
I had the dream again.
Of course you did, Tom.
You're becoming your new self.
You're one of us now.
Welcome aboard.
Did you have another dream?
No, I slept like a baby, actually.
I feel great.
Forgot how much I hate it here.
There's so much noise
in this time period.
So many people.
Look at them.
They have no idea what's coming.
They just move from pointless
errand to pointless errand.
It's disgusting.
I'd think you'd be
glad just to be alive.
You were given a chance
to continue your work.
The work that failed so badly?
The work that got
my previous host killed?
Don't blame your shortcomings
on Matthew Ross.
We are our hosts.
Your inability to harness
Isabelle Tyler was your failure.
I'll do better this time.
You need to get back to work.
Convince them to return
you to active duty.
I'll pull some strings if I have to,
but it's better if you
got it done on your own.
- And after I'm  there?
- That's the easy part.
Do what Tom Baldwin would do.
Find Isabelle Tyler.
I'll be in touch.
Richard, come play.
I can't.
Lily, I have to tell you something.
What is it, sweetheart?
I lied to you.
That picture you saw.
The pretty girl.
That was Isabelle.
My god, Richard. I had no idea
things had gotten so bad.
I don't expect you to forgive me,
but I need you to understand.
I did it for our daughter.
Why didn't you tell
me the truth right away?
I've been happy,
being with you the last few days.
You don't know how long it's been
since I've felt that way.
A good father will
do anything for his child,
and you're a good father.
But, Richard,
you took away her life.
The good and the bad.
You erased everything she was,
everything she could have been.
I knew I was wrong
after I did it to her, but...
Other people told me as much,
but I didn't listen.
I guess the only person
I could listen to was you.
Daddy...
I feel real.
We're talking.
- I've held Isabelle.
- No, you haven't.
My ability makes it seem
like you have.
I don't know if I'm  seeing you
because I want to,
or if someone conjured you up for me.
I don't know, Richard.
I don't know how I got here,
but maybe it doesn't matter.
I don't think I'm going
to be here much longer.
But if I have to go,
will you just hold me?
I love you, Richard.
I'm not saying we don't have to worry,
but nothing happened last night,
and this morning, Tom said he felt fine.
He said he didn't
want me to come over,
but where is he?
Because Tom is always
here at the crack of dawn.
Hey, what's up with Tom?
He just dragged Marco
out of his office.
I think Baldwin's
gone nuts or something.
Your mind is no match
for the power of my mind.
You are now under my control.
My mind is no match
for the power of your mind.
I am now under your control.
Total control.
Total control.
You should see their faces.
Sorry, Di, we were just trying
to ease the tension a little bit,
- that's all.
- You idiots!
Marco, you're fired.
You too, Garrity.
- Come on, that was classic!
- You can't fire this.
Go back to your office
and solve something.
- Hey, come on...
- Quick.
I'm sorry.
Good work.
No humor.
No humor in this room.
What?
Ah, you know what?
Seriously, look,
I'd like to thank you both
for helping me get through
these past few days,
but I had a great night's sleep.
I feel...
better, and, look
I really hope this is all over.
If I have any more flashes,
I'll tell you right away,
but in the meantime,
I'd really like to get back to work.
What about Rebecca Parrish?
I think we need to keep an eye on her.
Her visit to my place was...
definitely weird.
but maybe you were right.
Maybe the whole thing
was her bizarre version
of a pep talk.
Look, whatever it is,
I don't have to trust her
to do my job.
And I really want to do my job.
All right,
but I'll be watching you, okay?
Any more attempts at mind control
Baldwin, and you're out.
That wasn't funny.
I have a very simple message
for anyone who's thinking
about taking the shot.
Wait.
In a few months, the research
that I'm funding will be complete
and 50-50 will be a thing of the past.
We will have a very simple test
that can tell you whether
or not you'll survive the shot,
and no one ever has to risk dying again.
What about Jordan Collier?
Is he in favor of this?
You'd have to ask him that, Paul,
but we're talking about preventing
thousands of needless deaths here.
I don't see how anyone
could think that's a bad thing.
You did this to your own child.
I'm disappointed in you, Richard.
You told me you wanted
to use that water I gave you
to help an old army buddy.
I know it was wrong.
But you never would
have gave me what I needed
- if you knew what I had in mind.
- Oh, you're right about that.
These abilities we have,
they are a gift from god,
and we need to treat them
with respect.
I know that,
and that's why I'm here.
I'm hoping you can set things right.
Cora, please.
I need your help.
I'll see what I can do.
Byron, you gotta wake up.
Byron...
Isabelle needs you.
- Come on...
- Let him sleep.
He did what he needed to do.
Does that mean Isabelle's okay?
Not exactly,
but we're getting close.
I need you to call your father.
Call my father? Why?
You're going to have
to tell him where Isabelle is.
You want me to betray
her to the government?
If you know where she is, tell me.
- I'll go there myself.
- This is how it has to be.
I promise you, Kyle,
if you do exactly what I say,
Isabelle will not wind up in jail.
Think of everything we've done, Kyle.
All that we've accomplished together.
Are you really going
to start doubting me now?
Did it work?
Daddy...
Are you going out?
We had a tip on the Tyler case.
Someone called in from Promise City,
gave us the name
and address of a 4400
that Richard claimed
he'd been in contact with.
It was anonymous,
probably nothing.
You had the appointment
at Maia's school.
I figured I'd run it
down while you were out.
I'm back, so I'll go with you.
I'll just get my jacket.
Okay, great.
Did you see that?
The curtain just moved.
Well, so someone knows we're here.
That tip of yours said this lady's
just an associate of Tyler's, right?
Yeah, but we'd better play it safe.
Knock on the door.
I'm gonna head around back,
make sure no one
tries to flee the scene.
Richard, a car just pulled up outside.
Some people are coming.
Isabelle,
get down to the basement.
If you hear any kind of struggle,
run out the back, understand?
Answer the door if they knock.
See if you can get rid of them.
Cora Tomkins?
Hi. I'm Diana Skouris.
I'm from NTAC.
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Richard Tyler.
Richard Tyler?
I haven't seen him since quarantine.
Do you mind if I come in?
So Richard hasn't tried
to get in touch with you at all?
No phone calls? No emails?
No, but I keep
pretty much to myself.
Right.
Oh, I'm  sorry. I didn't realize
I was interrupting something.
- You have company.
- No, no.
Pardon my mess.
I'm not too good about
cleaning up after myself.
Like I say,
I knew the man in quarantine,
but I don't really keep in touch
with many of the 4400s.
- You people just don't quit.
- Don't move.
Are you okay?
What have you done to them?
Honey...
Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm sorry. I went around back,
and Isabelle was already
halfway down the alley
when I got out there.
I was going to chase her,
but I came back when
I heard the gunshot.
Where is she now?
I don't know, Diana,
she got away.
Good job, guys.
Today, agent Baldwin
and agent Skouris
provided a textbook example
of what we need to win this fight.
Initiative, savvy,
and exceptional teamwork.
The apprehension of Richard Tyler
is a huge win for us,
a reminder to everyone
that the rule of law still prevails
in this country.
Make no mistake,
there's lots more to be done,
but today....
Today we won.
Nice speech.
Yeah, exactly what Parrish
would say if she were marked.
Then again, it's exactly what Parrish
would say if she wasn't marked.
I know, either way,
she won today.
Nice work, you guys.
I gotta go make nice.
Hey, you...
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.
Sure?
We really got lucky today,
just finding Richard in that house.
It's a good thing you got that tip.
Yeah, well, it has to work
out for us sometimes, doesn't it?
This is not how this
was supposed to end!
Richard is in prison!
It's all over the news!
Isabelle's on the run.
Government's looking for her.
You said that she'd be okay.
You lied to me!
I promised you she
wouldn't end up in jail.
- She's not in jail.
- Yeah, and she's not safe, either.
- This is not what I wanted...
- This isn't about what you want, Kyle!
It's about what has to happen!
I'm not your sidekick.
I'm not here to run errands for you.
I'm here to tell you
what the movement needs,
and right now,
it needs for you to be strong,
because the next thing you have to do,
trust me,
it's not gonna be easy for you.
- What are you talking about?
- Your cousin Shawn?
The work he's doing
with that scientist
is threatening the entire movement.
Collier knows about it,
but he's too afraid
to get his hands dirty.
He shouldn't have
to get his hands dirty.
That's what he has people like you for.
People like me?
What do you want me to do?
Shawn Farrell has to be stopped.
Don't worry. You're safe.
- Where am I?
- You're at my house.
I gave you a tranquilizer,
then I brought you here.
- Where's my father?
- We put him on the inhibitor.
He's in prison.
He's gonna be there
for a very long time.
He didn't do anything wrong.
He was just trying to help me.
Isabelle, it's okay. It's okay.
There's a way to get him out.
I know people
who could make it happen.
It would be easy.
There's just one thing.
You...
have to take your abilities back.
Then, you can bring
Jordan Collier to me.

4400 avaient disparu
4400 sont revenus
Tous possèdent une aptitude unique
L'un d'entre eux porte un message
Quiconque peut devenir exceptionnel
Le risque est immense
À la hauteur des bienfaits
C'est irréversible
Le monde devra nous accepter.
<i>Précédemment dans</i> Les 4400...
J'étudie les profils de ceux...
qui ont pris de la promicine.
Bientôt, Kevin pense pouvoir prédire
qui survivra ou non
à une dose.
Tu me demandes de dire à la population
d'éviter la promicine ?
Juste pour quelques mois.
Je ne ferai pas de déclaration.
Qui es-tu ?
Je m'appelle Lindsey.
<i>Elle s'appelle Maia Rutledge.</i>
<i>Elle a été la première à disparaître,
d'après ce que l'on sait.</i>
<i>Ils sont morts, n'est-ce pas ?</i>
<i>Une partie de l'élite</i>
<i>souhaite que
le futur ne soit pas modifié.</i>
<i>Je les appelle...
"Les Marqués".</i>
<i>Et pour Imroth ?
Le P.D.G. d'Ubient Software</i>
<i>est censé être une sorte d'agent double
à la solde du futur ?</i>
Dis aux autres que
je suis allé voir les agents du NTAC.
<i>Baldwin pense que c'est un stratagème.</i>
<i>Quand on aura besoin de lui,</i>
<i>il sera là pour nous.</i>
Vous changez de personnalité.
Agissez comme Tom Baldwin.
Trouvez Isabelle Tyler.
Tu...
dois recouvrer tes capacités.
Ensuite, tu pourras
me livrer Jordan Collier.
Tom, que se passe-t-il ?
J'étais agité.
Je n'arrêtais pas de me retourner.
Je ne voulais pas te réveiller.
Alors, tu es juste resté...
- assis, là ?
- Non. Je te regardais dormir.
C'était apaisant.
Maintenant, je suis réveillée.
Alors... tu peux revenir te coucher ?
Voilà.
Ce n'est pas plus apaisant ?
Chez Andaluca ?
Ce n'est pas un peu chic, non ?
Et alors ?
Je suis plus une gamine.
Je regrette le temps
où tu ne voulais manger qu'au...
<i>Charlie's pizza palace</i>.
Maman, ça fait au moins...
très longtemps.
Oui, au moins... un an.
En plus, ça serait marrant
de manger espagnol avec Ben.
J'espère que
tu ne te fais pas de faux espoirs.
Je sais que Ben a dit
qu'il essaierait de venir, mais...
Londres est loin d'ici.
Je te promets,
je ne serai pas déçue.
À mon anniversaire,
il n'y a que...
comment dire, que toi et moi.
Avec Ben,
je me sentirais plus en famille.
Faites attention !
Ça va ?
- Ouais.
- C'est quoi, ça ?
C'est des vrais billets ?
En tout cas, on dirait bien.
"Ces petits morceaux de papier vert
"qui vous attirent tant,
n'ont aucune valeur."
"Bienvenue dans un monde nouveau."
"Un monde nouveau."
C'est du Jordan Collier tout craché.
Ça y ressemble,
mais est-on vraiment sûrs
que ces problèmes avec les DAB
sont créés par un 4400 ?
Ça pourrait aussi être l'oeuvre
d'un hacker de haut vol qui...
cherche à semer la pagaille.
En fait, je pencherais plutôt
pour un positif.
Pour l'instant, 58 DAB de 4 banques
différentes ont été affectés.
Ça veut dire que 4 serveurs différents
ont été atteints.
Des milliers de dollars
ont été distribués au hasard.
Dès qu'ils arrêtent un distributeur,
un autre se détraque.
J'aimerais rencontrer
le hacker qui a pu faire ça...
s'il n'a pas de capacité.
C'est quand même assez extrême,
même pour Collier.
Pour créer un nouveau monde,
il faut d'abord détruire l'ancien.
Perturber notre économie
est déjà un bon début.
J'aimerais bien conduire.
- Ça te va ?
- Pas de problème.
Il me faut du temps
avant d'aller voir Collier.
- Quelque chose ne va pas ?
- J'espère que non.
J'ai rendez-vous
pour passer un scanner.
Juste au cas où.
Depuis que ma tache est réapparue,
je suis un peu perturbé.
- Tu te sens pas différent ?
- Tu veux dire, comme un Marqué ?
Une sorte de zombie,
dirigé par un être du futur ?
Non... pas encore.
Je t'appelle en sortant de l'hôpital.
Vous ne voulez pas reconsidérer
votre position, M. Chatha ?
Prendre une dose serait...
extrêmement bénéfique, pour vous...
mais également pour les millions
de lecteurs qui voudraient vous suivre.
Oui, mais comprenez bien que...
il n'y a aucune garantie
que ce présumé test de compatibilité
dont parle Shawn Farrell,
soit mis au point.
Oui, d'accord,
si vous changez d'avis,
la porte est toujours ouverte.
Tu peux dire merci à ton cousin.
Le nom de Maneck Chatha
est sur la liste du livre.
On sait qu'il survivra à la dose.
C'est pour ceux qui le suivront
qu'il s'inquiète.
Pourquoi risquer leurs vies ?
Shawn a annoncé
que d'ici peu de temps,
le test sera disponible.
Dommage pour Chatha.
Ça ne serait pas arrivé
si tu m'avais écoutée.
Ouais, je sais.
Arrêter Shawn, hein ?
Ça veut dire quoi, exactement ?
J'espérais
que tu trouverais par toi-même.
Shawn ne travaille pas
sur ce test lui-même.
Ce que tu dois faire,
c'est te débarrasser de Kevin Burkhoff.
M'en débarrasser ?
Je suis censé faire quoi,
exactement, le tuer ?
Tu dois faire tout ce qui est nécessaire
pour accomplir la prophétie
et aider Jordan Collier
à créer le Paradis sur terre.
Bonjour, Isabelle.
J'espère que
tu te sens comme chez toi.
Tu sais, je dois avouer que...
de tous les bâtiments
que nous possédons, cet endroit...
est celui que je préfère.
Tu seras sans doute intéressée
de savoir que ton père sera transféré
de Seattle vers un centre de détention
du NTAC en Virginie.
Il faut que tu acceptes
de récupérer tes capacités
avant que Richard ne prenne cet avion,
parce que sinon...
il ne s'en sortira pas.
Tu as déjà causé
la mort de ta mère.
Tu veux être responsable
de celle de ton père également ?
Même si j'accepte de prendre une dose,
quel intérêt ?
Les médecins m'ont déjà prévenue
que la promicine me tuerait.
On peut y remédier, Isabelle.
Je t'assure que tu vivras
pour mener à bien ta mission.
Pour détruire les 4400, ainsi que
tous ceux qui ont pris de la promicine.
Et pour commencer,
tu nous amèneras Jordan Collier.
Vous savez, Kyle me parlait
tout le temps de vous.
Il disait que vous étiez honnête,
mais vous n'êtes pas
Tom Baldwin, pas vrai ?
Tom Baldwin était un homme
désorienté et insatisfait.
Je lui ai rendu la clairvoyance
dont il avait tant besoin,
et j'aimerais en faire autant
pour toi, Isabelle.
Après tout, je t'ai créée...
placée dans le ventre de ta mère
pour que tu reviennes
dans cette boule de lumière
et que tu protèges le monde des 4400.
La promicine est maudite.
Et maudits soient ceux qui en prennent.
Ils ne veulent pas changer le monde,
mais y mettre fin.
Tu peux les arrêter.
Tu <i>dois</i> les arrêter.
C'est ta destinée.
Comment peux-tu y renoncer ?

Des travaux manuels
dans la Ville Promise ?
C'est pas un peu dépassé ?
Pourquoi serait-ce dépassé
d'avoir le goût pour...
la sueur et l'effort ?
Avoir une aptitude
peut mener à la suffisance.
Et la suffisance...
est signe d'une société mourante.
Bienvenue dans un monde nouveau.
Vous êtes ici pour parler
de l'attaque des banques.
- Vous êtes au courant ?
- Je me tiens informé,
mais je peux vous assurer
que malgré la signature...
de ces attaques,
personne ici n'est responsable.
Comment pouvez-vous en être sûr ?
Vous devez être... 500 personnes
à vivre ici, maintenant.
Personne ne ferait un truc de ce genre
sans l'accord de Jordan.
Que je n'ai pas donné.
Alors, prouvez-le-nous.
Laissez-nous parler à ces gens,
et si personne n'y est pour rien,
ils pourraient nous aider
à trouver le responsable.
- Je crains que ce ne soit pas possible.
- En fait, vous ne voulez pas.
En fait... Peu importe qui l'a fait,
il a toutes mes amitiés.
Votre société est obsolète.
Toute société qui vénère le culte
de la richesse est damnée.
Alors, pourquoi ne pas inonder
les rues de billets...
<i>Tous ces bouts de papier n'ont pas
plus de valeur que des confettis.</i>
Mon Dieu, Tom, non !
Papa, non.
S'il te plaît...
Par pitié, papa !
Le futur auquel je crois,
peut exister sans argent.
Un monde où les miracles
sont la monnaie courante.
Excusez-moi,
j'ai du travail qui m'attend.
<i>Ça ne touche pas que les DAB.</i>
On fait face à des pannes d'ordinateurs
dans tout le pays.
Sûrement le monde entier.
Agences fédérales,
sociétés financières,
commerces privés...
Même le portable de vos voisins
peut planter,
victime du même virus
qui a infecté les DAB.
Et ces attaques
sont tout sauf un hasard.
Tous les ordinateurs qui plantent,
y compris les DAB,
ont une chose en commun.
Ils utilisent tous le système
<i>Enzyme</i> d'Ubient.
Ubient ?
C'est la compagnie de Drew Imroth.
Alors, je pense que
la question à se poser est...
Ces attaques visent-elles...
Drew Imroth, magnat des affaires
et multimilliardaire ?
Ou Drew Imroth...
le membre présumé de la conspiration
mondiale des Marqués ?
Comme tu le dis, "présumé".
On n'a aucune preuve concrète
que les Marqués existent.
Tom et moi en sommes
quasi convaincus.
Oui, tout à fait.
Ubient est l'une des plus importantes
sociétés au monde.
Si elle coule,
on a tous du souci à se faire.
Je suis navrée,
je ne voulais pas vous interrompre.
Pas du tout...
Je vous présente Abigail Hunnicutt.
Elle vient d'arriver.
C'est une chance
qu'elle nous rejoigne.
Abigail enseigne l'analyse
combinatoire et les probabilités
au M.I.T. depuis ses 22 ans.
J'ai aussi financé mon doctorat
en travaillant au rayon homme
chez <i>Sak's</i>. Alors...
Qui sait ?
Peut-être que je pourrais...
apprendre à ces deux-là
comment s'habiller en adulte.
Je pense que vous devriez
jeter un coup d'oeil là-dessus.
C'est une sorte de manifeste.
Tous les ordinateurs infectés
par le virus l'impriment.
Un appel à l'anéantissement
d'Ubient Software.
Raison de plus, Marqué ou non,
qu'on aille parler avec Drew Imroth.
Salut, Maia.
C'est Lindsey.
- Joyeux anniversaire.
- <i>Salut. Tu t'en es souvenue !</i>
Tu sais, c'est pas avant deux jours.
<i>Pas grave.</i>
J'ai un cadeau d'enfer pour toi.
- Tu veux passer ?
- <i>C'est pas ce genre de cadeau.</i>
Tu dois venir à la Ville Promise
et voir ça par toi-même.
Ma mère veut vraiment
que j'évite cet endroit.
<i>Elle n'a pas besoin de savoir.
Tu verras, tu me remercieras vraiment.</i>
Je vais essayer de passer
demain après l'école.
Super. On se retrouve à l'angle
de Beacon et de la 64e à 15h30.
J'ai des amis ici qui nous aideront
à passer le barrage.
D'accord, salut.
Oui, M. le Ministre,
je comprends combien vos archives
sont sensibles.
Je vous promets
qu'une fois le problème résolu,
Ubient fera tout son possible
pour récupérer vos données perdues.
Croyez-moi, Monsieur,
je partage votre inquiétude.
Je suis aussi actionnaire.
Je vous avais prévenus
que quelque chose de la sorte
allait arriver.
Jordan Collier et ses adeptes
préparent une révolution mondiale,
et cette attaque contre ma société
est la première étape.
Nous revenons de la Ville Promise.
Collier nie toute implication.
Je n'y crois pas.
Et j'ose espérer que vous non plus !
Que ce soit un des hommes de Collier
ou un positif,
aucune importance, on le trouvera.
Quand ?
Ma société existera-t-elle encore ?
On fait de notre mieux.
Tout ceci aurait pu être évité
si vous aviez fait votre boulot
dès le début.
Mais non, vous étiez trop occupés
à courir après des complots imaginaires.
En parlant de ça, agent Baldwin,
voulez-vous regarder
ma tache à nouveau ?
Ça ne sera pas nécessaire.
Ravi de voir que vos priorités
sont enfin les bonnes.
J'espère qu'il n'est pas trop tard
pour sauver ma société.
Avec votre succès, vous avez dû
vous faire pas mal d'ennemis.
Des milliers.
En fait, je tiens une liste...
de tous ceux qui ont pu m'envoyer
une lettre ou un e-mail de menace.
Classés par niveau d'agressivité.
C'est un passe-temps.
Steve Jobs figure en première page ?
Vous devriez peut-être
le tester à la promicine.
Dr Burkhoff,
prêt pour une petite pause ?
Pas maintenant.
J'ai perdu énormément de données
quand cet ordinateur a planté.
C'est le virus Ubient.
Tout notre réseau est planté.
C'est censé me remonter le moral ?
Je dois reconstituer un document
de 74 pages de mémoire,
et j'en suis à la page 12 !
J'admire votre dévouement,
mais j'ai promis à Tess de vous sortir
du labo de temps en temps.
- Vous avez parlé à Tess ?
- Oui, à l'instant.
Elle semblait passer
de bons moments avec sa nièce.
Sa petite-nièce.
Tess est née en 1937.
C'est vrai, désolé.
J'avais oublié.
Vous devez vous reposer.
J'ai une surprise pour vous.
Venez, c'est un massage.
- Elle vous attend en haut.
- Non, merci.
J'aime pas
que des étrangers me touchent.
Les mains sont parfois tellement...
moites.
Très bien, mais j'ai déjà payé.
Eh bien, je vous en prie.
Profitez-en.
Je vais rester ici,
travailler
à sauver des milliers de vies,
et améliorer le monde.
Merci.
Tu sais...
Imroth ne plaisantait pas
quand il parlait de ses ennemis.
Il va nous falloir toute la nuit
pour étudier ça.
- Je vais emporter ma partie chez moi.
- Bonne idée.
Tu m'as vraiment surprise aujourd'hui,
dans le bureau d'Imroth.
La façon dont tu as réagi
quand il t'a gueulé dessus.
Il vit un moment difficile.
J'essayais d'être diplomate.
Je voulais dire,
vu ce dont on le suspecte.
Il a mentionné les Marqués,
et tu as à peine...
relevé.
Tout comme toi.
C'est pas comme s'il allait avouer
quoi que ce soit.
Promis, la prochaine fois
qu'il nous engueule,
ça va chauffer, OK ?
Bonne nuit.
Est-ce que...
t'as eu les résultats du scan ?
Ah, oui.
Oui, rien d'anormal.
Merci d'avoir demandé.
- Bonne nuit.
- Bonne nuit.
<i>Salut, Kevin.</i>
<i>Je suis de retour.</i>
<i>Par ici.</i>
<i>Tu me vois ?</i>
<i>Viens me voir.</i>
Je ne t'attendais pas
avant quelques jours.
<i>Kevin, je suis là.</i>
<i>Où es-tu ?</i>
Me voilà.
Voilà votre petit-déjeuner.
Ce sont les ordres,
vous devez manger.
Lâche-la !
On doit pas lui faire de mal.
Bonjour, Diana.
T'as lu des menaces de mort sympas
ces derniers temps ?
Beaucoup trop.
Alors, on a quoi, 8000 suspects ?
Bonne chance
pour tous les retrouver.
Et ta soirée ?
Assez bizarre.
Je rentrais à la maison
quand Drew Imroth m'a appelé.
Ouais, je sais,
j'étais étonné aussi.
Bref, il m'a dit
qu'il devait me voir sur-le-champ,
seul, à Madison Park.
J'ai trouvé ça...
un peu romanesque,
mais est-ce que j'avais le choix ?
- Tu devais y aller.
- Voilà.
En fait, il voulait que je refile
l'affaire à un autre agent.
Il a peur que je cherche toujours
à prouver qu'il fait partie des Marqués.
Tu lui as dit quoi ?
La vérité.
Qu'il n'avait pas à s'inquiéter.
Que je ferai mon boulot
du mieux que je peux.
Après, je lui ai demandé
de nommer chacun des Marqués,
et c'est là que ça a chauffé,
comme tu l'espérais.
Vaut mieux que je réponde.
Je te retrouve dans le bureau.
Baldwin...
Quand ça ?
Isabelle n'a rien ?
Très bien.
Faut que je trouve une excuse.
J'arrive.
Où est Kevin ?
Aucune idée. L'équipe d'entretien
est passée ce matin.
Ils ont trouvé le bureau tel quel.
Tous ses travaux ont disparu aussi.
C'était Jordan.
C'est forcément lui.
Il savait pour le test de compatibilité.
C'est tellement bizarre.
Tous ces gens prêts à risquer
leur vie pour avoir une capacité.
Ils pensent
qu'ils se sentiront moins seuls,
plus puissants.
Jamais je n'ai été
si seule et impuissante
que quand mes capacités
étaient illimitées.
Elles ont bouleversé ma vie entière.
Elles sont devenues mon identité,
m'ont coupée de tous...
De mes parents...
De Shawn...
C'est seulement quand j'ai tout perdu
que je me suis trouvée,
et maintenant, vous voulez
que je revienne en arrière.
- Que je redevienne cette personne.
- C'est ce que tu es.
Ça ne sera pas si mal, Isabelle.
Ces derniers mois
étaient des vacances,
tu as vu du pays,
mais il est temps
de se remettre au travail.
Ça faisait du bien d'être normale...
Enfin, pendant un temps.
Alors, ceci est une version modifiée
d'un logiciel d'analyse de documents
programmé par Abigail
quand elle était au M.I.T.
On l'a utilisé pour recouper le langage
utilisé dans le manifeste anti-Ubient
avec celui du mail de menace
envoyé à Imroth.
On cherchait
des phrases idiosyncrasiques
ainsi que des expressions similaires
dans chaque document.
Vous pouvez voir
que l'auteur du manifeste
utilise beaucoup les points-virgules.
Il préfère aussi utiliser "ce qui"
et "ce que" au lieu de "que",
et appelle Imroth
"M. le Marionnettiste".
Une expression
qu'il reprend six fois.
Et qu'avons-nous trouvé
dans les mails de menace ?
Ce document.
Points-virgules.
"Ce qui" et "ce que" au lieu de "que",
et pour finir, notre vieil ami,
"M. le Marionnettiste".
Alors, les deux auteurs ne font qu'un.
Vous avez un nom ?
Ce mail est signé "Escroc".
Imroth a travaillé dessus.
Il est remonté
à un certain Warren Trask.
Au début des années 80,
Trask a conçu
une version préliminaire
du système d'exploitation <i>Enzyme</i>.
Quand Imroth a sorti
un programme quasi identique,
- Trask l'a poursuivi.
- Ne dites rien... Il a perdu.
Ils ne sont pas allés au tribunal.
Imroth a proposé un accord à Trask.
Trask s'en est sorti avec 100 000 $.
Pendant ce temps, <i>Enzyme</i>
avait rapporté des millions à Imroth.
- Donc, le mec est furieux.
- Qui ne le serait pas ?
Vous pouvez lui demander vous-même.
Il vit à Seattle.
Bon boulot, Marco.
En fait, c'est grâce à Abigail.
Elle t'a aussi acheté ton costume ?
Arrête d'avoir les jetons.
On y est presque.
Je peux pas rester longtemps.
- Si ma mère le sait...
- Elle ne saura rien.
Je t'ai promis une surprise
pour ton anniversaire, non ?
Eh bien, la voilà.
Papa ? Maman ?
Maia, c'est bien toi ?
Vic, tu as vu comme elle a grandi ?
C'est toujours ma petite fille.
J'aimerais tellement te faire
un énorme câlin pour ton anniversaire.
Moi aussi.
Mais tu ne peux pas.
C'est un 4400 qui vous crée.
Quoi que nous soyons,
nous sommes tes parents,
et nous t'aimons
de tout notre coeur.
Excusez-moi.
Agent Baldwin, agent Skouris.
Nous sommes du NTAC.
Nous venons voir Warren Trask.
Je suis sa fille, Eileen.
- De quoi s'agit-il ?
- On aimerait interroger votre père
au sujet de Drew Imroth.
Vous pouvez lui demander
tout ce que vous voulez,
mais n'espérez pas
qu'il vous réponde.
Mon père a eu une attaque
il y a trois mois.
Il n'a ni bougé ni parlé depuis.
Mon père était un homme brillant,
mais il était naïf et trop confiant,
et Drew Imroth en a profité
pour détruire le travail
de toute une vie.
Sa carrière, son mariage,
sa... santé.
Mon père a tout perdu.
Quand a-t-il pris de la promicine ?
Il y a 6 mois.
Mais apparemment,
ça ne lui a rien fait.
Aucune capacité, rien.
Puis il a eu son anévrisme.
Vous croyez vraiment qu'il est
à l'origine des problèmes d'Ubient ?
Tous ces appareils
auxquels il est relié,
ils utilisent un ordinateur
connecté à un réseau
de surveillance
pour les urgences.
Si son cerveau fonctionne,
et qu'il a une capacité, alors...
il pourrait se cacher derrière tout ça.
Eh bien, ce serait...
merveilleux.
Papa,
si c'est vrai,
je serais si contente.
Continue tant qu'Imroth n'est pas ruiné
comme tu l'as été.
Ça suffit.
- Vous me faites mal.
- Tom, lâche-la.
Elle est complice
d'une demi-douzaine de crimes.
Si vous nous cachez quoi que ce soit,
vous feriez mieux de parler.
Je ne sais rien du tout,
mais si mon père
fait tomber Drew Imroth,
ce ne sera que justice.
J'hallucine ou je suis en présence
d'un papillon Xerces bleu ?
Je crois bien que c'en est un.
Le Xerces bleu
s'est éteint en 1941.
Pas ici.
Plus maintenant.
Un de nos résidents
peut modifier l'ADN
pour recréer des espèces éteintes.
Que des insectes pour le moment.
Mais on espère des mammifères bientôt.
Je ne sais pas vous, mais j'adorerais
voir un mammouth en chair et en os.
Je suis impressionné...
Et il en faut pour m'impressionner.
Un homme de votre calibre
pourrait tout faire
ici dans la Ville Promise.
Un argument qui aurait pu être
plus persuasif,
si je n'avais pas été kidnappé
et retenu contre mon gré.
C'était mon idée.
Jordan n'était au courant de rien.
Et c'est censé me rassurer ?
La méthode de Kyle
était peut-être extrême,
mais j'en approuve la raison.
Votre place est ici,
dans la Ville Promise,
à nos côtés, Kevin.
Vous êtes le père
du mouvement pour la promicine.
Sans vos découvertes,
la Ville Promise n'existerait même pas.
J'ai fait une découverte scientifique...
mais je n'ai pas lancé
de culte religieux.
Que vous l'acceptiez ou non,
tout le monde vous vénère, ici.
Cependant, je ne peux vous laisser
poursuivre vos recherches.
Un test de compatibilité
à la promicine
signerait l'arrêt de mort
de ce mouvement.
Tout ce que je veux faire,
c'est sauver des vies, Jordan.
Nous aussi.
Nous voyons juste
un peu plus loin.
Donc, à moins
de partager notre vision,
je crains de devoir vous forcer
à rester parmi nous.
Demain à 8 h ?
J'espérais un peu plus tôt.
On peut pas formellement prouver
que Trask est notre homme,
mais on sait
qu'il a pris de la promicine.
OK, si c'est le mieux que
vous puissiez faire. Merci.
On ne pourra pas transférer Trask
au NTAC avant demain matin.
Mais Ubient perd des millions
de dollars par heure.
L'action a chuté de 500 points.
Je sais pas vous,
mais mon plan de retraite est mort.
On a tout fait pour l'isoler.
On a coupé le téléphone
et Internet, chez lui.
On ne sait même pas
s'il a besoin du téléphone.
Mettons Trask sous inhibiteur,
et tout de suite.
Pas question.
Ses docteurs l'ont interdit.
Étant donné son état de santé,
c'est trop risqué.
Ça vaut peut-être le coup.
Cacher Trask au NTAC
ne garantit pas
que les attaques s'arrêteront.
Que proposes-tu, Tom ?
De le tuer ?
Bien sûr que non !
C'est que...
C'est frustrant, pour nous tous.
De toute façon, on ne peut
rien faire avant demain matin.
Salut, Miss Anniversaire.
Je suis rentrée !
Pourquoi n'es-tu pas habillée ?
J'ai réservé pour 19 h.
Je serai prête.
Après on rentre,
et on ouvre les cadeaux, d'accord ?
Ça me va.
Ça ne va pas ?
Il s'est passé quelque chose ?
Je t'avais dit de ne pa
trop espérer pour Ben.
Je t'ai dit,
c'est oublié, tout ça.
Tant mieux, parce que moi,
mais je mangerais bien
une part de gâteau.
Alors, on y va, OK ?
- Oui ?
<i>- C'est moi.</i>
Dites-moi que
vous avez de bonnes nouvelles.
Parce qu'à ce rythme,
Ubient n'existera plus d'ici 3 jours,
signifiant la perte de tout
notre soutien financier,
<i>sans parler de
notre programme-espion...</i>
J'ai compris.
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
Je m'en occupe.
<i>J'espère bien.</i>
Oh, mon Dieu, papa ?
Papa ?
Allez.
Une demi-douzaine de voisins
dit avoir entendu le bruit.
- Mais personne n'a rien vu ?
- Apparemment, non.
Bonjour.
L'ordonnance du tribunal
est arrivée ?
Oui.
Mais ça ne sert plus à rien.
Pourquoi ça ?
Hier soir, une voiture volée s'est
crashée dans un pylône téléphonique
juste à côté de chez Trask.
Plus de courant dans le quartier.
Son respirateur artificiel s'est arrêté,
il est passé sur batterie,
mais le portable de sa fille
ne marchait pas.
Le temps de trouver un téléphone...
Trask est mort ?
Ne fais pas comme si
ça t'affectait vraiment.
Je suis surpris, c'est tout.
Et les attaques contre Ubient ?
Depuis ce matin,
Ubient est libéré de tout virus.
On dirait que
la boîte d'Imroth va survivre,
ainsi que notre économie.
Le marché a déjà repris 200 points.
Bizarre comment dénouement,
mais au moins, c'est réglé.
Oui, on a eu de la chance,
enfin, à part Warren Trask.
Tu t'es fait quoi, à la tête ?
Je me suis cogné
contre l'armoire à pharmacie
en pleine nuit. La prochaine fois,
j'allumerai la lumière.
Bonne idée.
Tu as 5 minutes, Shawn.
Dis-moi ce que tu veux.
Je veux que tu libères Kevin Burkhoff.
Je sais qu'il est là.
Dr Burkhoff est bien là.
Il est mon invité,
et le demeurera
le temps qu'il faudra.
Dis-moi, Jordan,
depuis quand le kidnapping
fait-il partie
de ta nouvelle religion ?
C'est une manière assez bizarre
de rapprocher le monde de Dieu.
Tu veux revenir
dans mes bonnes grâces ?
C'est simple.
Organise une autre conférence de presse,
annonce que tu as changé d'avis,
et que tu es
pour la prise de promicine.
Tu sais que je ne peux pas.
Alors, Kevin Burkhoff
reste mon invité.
Et toi...
Tu n'es plus le bienvenu
dans la Ville Promise.
Au revoir, Shawn.
Comment va ma copine ?
Comme si j'allais mourir.
C'est juste ton corps
qui se débarrasse
des allergènes anti-promicine.
Ça fait partie du processus.
Regarde par ici.
Voilà.
Maintenant...
Passons à la phase suivante.
Ne faites pas ça... Non.
Tout va bien, Isabelle.
Dans quelques secondes,
tu iras beaucoup mieux.
Tu vois ?
C'était pas si terrible.
Ah oui, et...
Isabelle, je sais
ce que tu as en tête.
Tes capacités recouvrées,
tu les utiliseras contre moi.
Ça a marché une fois par le passé
quand tu as tué Matthew Ross,
mais ne recommence pas.
Ce coup-ci,
nous ne prenons aucun risque.
On t'a implanté un dispositif
quand tu étais en prison.
Appelle ça un...
interrupteur mortel.
Si tu tentes quoi que ce soit,
ou me désobéis,
je l'enclencherai, et tu mourras.
Maintenant, tu n'as plus qu'à...
te reposer encore une heure ou deux,
et quand tu te lèveras,
tu seras la personne
la plus puissante de la planète...
De nouveau.
Alors, ça donne quoi ?
Le labo a fait les tests
que tu as demandés.
L'échantillon qu'ils ont prélevé
était assez abîmé.
Ça prendra quelques jours
pour avoir des résultats concluants,
mais on a les résultats préliminaires.
Je suis désolé, Diana,
mais il y a environ 80 % de chances
que ce soit le sang de Tom Baldwin.
Ces dernières semaines,
je voyais bien
que quelque chose clochait.
C'était...
C'était le même homme,
mais différent, vous voyez ?
Et je me répétais :
"Tout va bien, c'est toujours Tom."
Je ne voulais pas y croire non plus.
C'est mon partenaire et ami,
depuis des années.
Et imaginez coucher avec l'ennemi...
Je ne sais pas s'il vous a dit,
mais... Tom et moi...
Il ne m'a rien dit...
Mais la possibilité
m'avait traversé l'esprit.
OK, passons.
La question est :
que faire, maintenant, Diana ?
Il faut trouver un moyen
de retrouver le vrai Tom Baldwin,
et il ne faut pas
qu'il suspecte que nous savons.
Il faudra nous forcer à faire
comme si rien n'avait changé.
Au bureau,
ce ne sera pas un problème,
mais en dehors...
Ça ne va pas être facile.
Les moments très intimes, je...
Je ne suis pas sûre de pouvoir gérer.
Alors, vous avez tout compris ?
Quel que soit le sujet.
Tom, que fais-tu si tard, au bureau ?
Je rattrape un peu de retard.
- Et vous ?
- Eh bien... Pareil.
Et si on se faisait un resto ?
Qui est partant ?
Je ne peux pas.
Je suis attendue chez mon père.
Je dois rentrer.
Je vais terminer
ce que je fais ici.
- Passez une bonne nuit.
- Oui, toi aussi.
Bonne nuit.
Je dois dire que
vous avez fait du beau boulot.
Avec Trask hors course,
l'entreprise est finalement repartie.
Les 2 prochains trimestres
seront au pire hésitants,
mais grâce à vous,
Ubient a survécu.
Vous ne semblez pas ravi.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
La dernière action de Trask
a été de diffuser vos données
personnelles sur Internet.
Noms, téléphones,
relevés de compte.
Tout est exposé
à quiconque veut les voir.
Ou les étudier.
Cela pourrait susciter
de délicates questions.
Alors, limitons les dégâts...
On efface tout ce qu'on peut
et on nie tout le reste.
Les adeptes de conspiration
vont s'en donner à coeur joie.
Alors, une décision a été prise, Drew.
Nous allons adopter
une approche plus radicale.
À quoi pensez-vous ?
Salut, maman !
Salut, papa !
Bonjour, ma chérie.
Ton anniversaire était bien ?
Assez sympa.
J'aurais juste aimé
que vous soyez là.
- Nous aussi.
- Tu as été gâtée ?
J'ai eu un nouvel iPod.
C'est comme un tourne-disque,
mais avec des milliers de chansons.
- Du Sinatra ?
- Des tonnes de Sinatra.
La prochaine fois, je l'apporterai.
Tu es sûre que tu peux sortir ?
Nous ne voulons pas t'empêcher
de faire tes devoirs ou autre.
Mias pas du tout.
J'aime venir ici et vous voir.
J'aimerais pouvoir venir
tous les jours.
Nous aussi.
Mais tu es là.
Jordan ne libérera jamais Kevin.
Alors, c'est tout ? Il n'y aura
jamais de test de compatibilité ?
Il faut qu'il y en ait un.
Je dois tout faire pour.
Prends le téléphone
et mets la main sur Tess.
Nous allons sortir Kevin
de la Ville Promise.
Tout est prêt.
Il comprend ce qu'il a à faire.
Un peu déçu au début.
Après tout, il s'en est bien sorti.
<i>Mais en fin de compte,
il l'a bien pris.</i>
<i>Il sait qu'il est temps
de passer à autre chose.</i>
Je suis sûr
qu'il le prend comme un honneur...
Surtout lorsqu'il a su le nouvel hôte
que nous lui proposions.
<i>Il a été un excellent Drew Imroth.</i>
Mais il sera encore meilleur
en Jordan Collier.
[ www.seriessub.com ]
<i>v1.00</i>
<i>SeriesSub</i> presents...
The world
will have to deal with us.
<I>Previously on</i> The 4400...
I'm putting together profiles
of the people...
who've taken the shot.
Pretty soon, Kevin thinks
he'll be able to predict
who will survive the shot
and who won't.
Are you really asking me
to tell people not to take promicin?
Only for a few months.
I am not making
any announcement.
Who are you?
I'm Lindsey.
<i>This is Maia Rutledge.
<i>She was the first one to disappear
as far as we can tell.
<i>They're dead, aren't they?
<i>There's a faction of elites
<i>who want the future
to stay exactly as it is.
<i>I call them "The Marked."
<i>What about Imroth?
The CEO of Ubient software's
<i>supposed to be some kind of
double agent from the future?
<i>Tell the others
I went to see the NTAC agents.
<i>Baldwin thinks
it's some kind of ploy.
<i>When we need him,
<i>he'll be there for us.
You're becoming
your new self.
Do what Tom Baldwin would do.
Find Isabelle Tyler.
You...
have to take
your abilities back.
Then you're going to bring
Jordan Collier to me.
Tom, what's going on?
I felt restless.
I kept tossing and turning,
I didn't want to wake you.
So you were just...
- sitting here?
- No. I was watching you sleep.
It's kind of relaxing.
Well, I'm awake now.
So... why don't you
come back to bed?
There.
Isn't this more relaxing?
Andaluca's?
Isn't that
a little bit fancy?
So?
I'm not a little kid anymore.
I just miss the days
when the only place you'd eat was...
Charlie's pizza palace.
Mom, that was, like...
a long time ago.
Oh, yeah,
at least a year.
Besides, it'd be fun
eating spanish food with Ben again.
I hope you're not
getting your hopes up for nothing.
I know that Ben said
that he might make it, but...
London is a long way off.
I promise
I won't be disappointed.
On my birthday,
it's just been...
I don't know,
just you and me,
and with Ben,
it would feel more like family.
Excuse me!
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- What's that?
Is this real money?
Certainly looks like it.
"These little green
scraps of paper
you're fighting over
are worthless."
"Welcome to
the new world."
"The new world". That's right out of
Jordan Collier's playbook.
It sounds like it,
but can we be really sure
that these ATM malfunctions
are being caused by some 4400 ability?
Because it could be the work
of some sophisticated
computer hacker who's just...
looking to create some havoc.
Actually, I have to go with
a p-positive here, Diana.
So far, 58 ATMs from four separate
banking institutions have been affected.
That means four separate computer
mainframes have been compromised.
Thousands of dollars
are being randomly dispensed.
Every time they shut down an ATM,
another one goes haywire.
I'd like to meet the computer hacker
that can pull that off,
you know, without an ability.
Pretty aggressive move, though,
I mean, even for Collier.
If you want to create a new world,
first, you have to destroy the old one,
and disrupting the economy's
a pretty good way to start.
I wouldn't mind driving.
- Does that work for you?
- Be my guest.
I'm gonna need an hour or two
before we go see Collier.
- Is there something wrong?
- Hopefully not.
I've got an appointment
for a cat-scan.
It's just a precaution.
Ever since the mole came back,
I've been a little on edge.
- You don't feel any different, do you?
- You mean, am I one of the marked?
Some kind of zombie
controlled by a future human?
Not... not yet, anyway.
I'll call you
when I'm done with the hospital.
Are you sure you won't
reconsider, Mr. Chatha?
Taking the shot
would be...
hugely beneficial,
not only to you,
but to the millions of your readers
who would follow your example.
Yes, but you have to
understand that...
there is no guarantee that
this alleged compatibility test
of Shawn Farrell's
will ever be perfected.
Yes, well,
if you change your mind,
the door's always open.
We have your cousin
to thank for that.
Maneck Chatha's name is on the list
in the white light book.
We already know
he can survive the shot.
It's his followers
he's worried about.
Why risk their lives
when Shawn's announced
it's only a matter of time
before the test is available?
Too bad you lost Chatha.
It wouldn't have happened
if you'd done what I told you to.
Yeah, I know.
Stop Shawn, right?
What does that mean exactly?
I was hoping
you'd figure that out for yourself.
Shawn's not developing
this test by himself.
What you need to do
is get rid of Kevin  Burkhoff.
Get rid of him?
What am I supposed to do exactly,
kill the guy?
I expect you to do whatever it takes
to fulfill the prophecy
and help Jordan Collier
bring heaven to earth.
Good morning, Isabelle.
I hope you're feeling at home.
You know, I have to say...
of all of our real estate holdings,
this place is my favorite.
I thought you'd like to know,
tomorrow, your father's being moved
from Seattle
to an NTAC holding facility in Virginia.
Which means you need to agree
to take your abilities back
before Richard steps on that plane,
because if you don't,
he's not getting off it.
You already caused
your mother's death.
Do you want to be responsible
for your father's, too?
Even if I agreed to take the shot,
what's the point?
The government doctors already told me
that promicin will kill me.
We can change that, Isabelle.
I guarantee you'll live
to fulfill your original mission...
To destroy the 4400, and anyone else
with trace of promicin in their system.
And you will start
by bringing us Jordan Collier.
You know, Kyle used to
talk about you all the time.
He said
you were a decent man,
but then you're not Tom Baldwin,
are you?
Tom Baldwin was a confused
and unhappy man.
I've given him the clarity of purpose
he desperately needed,
and I want to give that
to you, Isabelle.
After all, I created you...
Placed you in your mother's womb
to make sure you were sent back
in that ball of light,
so you could protect the world
from the 4400.
Promicin is evil.
People who use it are evil.
Their goal isn't to change the world,
it is to end it.
You can stop them.
You have to stop them.
It's what you're meant to do.
How can you say no
to your destiny?

Manual labor
in Promise City?
Isn't that
a bit old school?
Nothing wrong with old school,
when it comes to a little...
sweat and muscle.
Having an ability can
lead to complacency,
and complacency...
is the measure
of a dying society.
Welcome to the new world.
You're here about the attacks
on the banking system.
- You know about that?
- I try to stay current,
but I can assure you
that despite the attacker's...
utopian signature,
nobody here had anything to do with it.
Can you really be sure of that?
You must have, like, 500 people
living here by now.
Nobody here would do something like that
without Jordan's consent.
Which I didn't give.
Well, just proove it to us.
Let us talk to your people,
and if...
nobody did it, maybe they can
help us find out
- who the hell is responsible.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
You mean you won't.
I mean... Whoever's doing this
has my best wishes.
The system you live in
is obsolete.
Any society that worships
at the altar of wealth is doomed,
so why not flood
the streets with money...
<i>All those little pieces of paper</i>
<I>are as worthless as confetti.</I>
Christ, Tom, no!
Dad, don't.
Please don't...
Please don't, dad.
Because the future
I believe in,
is one that exists
without the need for money.
It's a world where miracles
are common currency.
Now, excuse me,
I have some work to do.
<i>It's not just ATMs anymore.
We're looking at computer system
failures all over the country.
Make that the world.
Federal agencies,
financial institutions,
private businesses...
Even your friendly neighborhood laptops
are all crashing,
victims of the same corrosive virus
that infected the ATMs.
And these attacks
are anything but random.
Every malfunctioning computer,
including the original ATMs
has one thing in common.
They all run Ubient's
<i>Enzyme</i> operating system.
Ubient?
That's Drew Imroth's company.
So, I guess the question
we have to ask is this...
Are these attacks against...
Drew Imroth,
the multi-billionaire corporate giant?
Or Drew Imroth...
the alleged member of the global
conspiracy known as The Marked?
The operative word
is "alleged."
We don't even have any hard evidence
that The Marked exist.
Tom and I are pretty certain.
Yeah, that's right.
But even so, Ubient is one of
the biggest corporations in the world.
If it goes under,
we're all in trouble.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
No...
Everybody, this is Abigail Hunnicutt.
She's new.
We were lucky
to grab her.
Abigail's been teaching a course
in combinatorics and probability
at M.I.T. since she was 22.
I also worked my way
through graduate school
in the men's department
at Sak's. So...
Who knows?
Maybe I can...
teach these guys
how to dress like grown-ups.
I thought
everyone should see this.
It's some kind of manifesto.
Every computer
infected with the virus
is printing it out.
It's calling for the destruction
of all Ubient software.
Which is why, marked or not,
we need to speak with Drew Imroth.
Hello?
Hey, Maia.
It's me Lindsey.
- Happy birthday.
- <I>Hi. I can't believe you remembered.
You know, it's not
for another two days.
<i>Whatever.</i>
I have got the coolest gift for you.
- You want to come over?
- <i>It's not that kind of present.
You have to come to Promise City
and see it for yourself.
My mom really wants me
to stay away from there.
<i>She doesn't have to know.
You are so going to thank me for this.
I guess I can come by
tomorrow after school.
Great. Meet me at the southwest corner
of Beacon and 64th street at 3:30.
I've got some friends here
who will help us sneak past
the government blockade.
Okay, bye.
Yes, Mr. Secretary,
I understand how sensitive
your department records are.
I promise that once we get
the problem resolved,
Ubient will do everything possible
to retrieve your lost data.
Believe me, sir,
I feel your pain.
I'm a stockholder, too.
I warned you
that something like this
was going to happen.
Jordan Collier and his followers
are bent on global revolution,
and this assault on my company
is the opening salvo.
We just came from Promise City.
Collier's denying any involvement.
I don't believe that,
and I certainly hope
you two don't either!
Whether it's Collier's people
or some rogue p-positive,
it doesn't really matter,
we'll find him.
When will that be?
Will I still have
a company left by then?
We're doing our best.
All of this could
have been avoided
if you people had done your jobs
in the first place.
But, no, you were too busy
chasing after imaginary conspiracies.
How about it, agent Baldwin?
Would you like to check
my mole again?
That won't be necessary.
Glad to see you finally have
your priorities straight.
I just hope it's not too late
to save my company.
With all your success over the years,
you must've made your share of enemies.
Thousands of them.
In fact, I keep a list...
of everyone who's ever sent me
a threatening letter or email.
Organized by level
of vehemence.
It's a hobby.
Is Steve Jobs
on page one?
You might want to give him
a promicin test.
Dr. Burkhoff,
you ready for a break?
Not now.
I lost quite a bit of data
when this computer crashed.
Right, that's that Ubient virus.
The net's down in the entire building.
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?
I have to reconstruct
a 74-page document from memory,
and I'm on, like, what...
Page 12?
I appreciate
your dedication,
but I kinda promised Tess I'd get you
out of the lab once in a while.
- You spoke to Tess?
- Yeah, just now.
Sounds like she's having
a great time with her niece.
Grand-niece, actually.
Tess was born in 1937.
Right, sorry.
I forgot.
You need a break.
I got a surprise for you.
Come on, it's a massage.
- She's waiting upstairs.
- No, thank you.
I don't like strangers
touching me.
The human hand can be so...
clammy.
Okay, but I already paid
for the hour.
Well, be my guest.
Enjoy yourself.
I'll just be down here,
working to save
thousands of lives
and change the world
for the better.
Thank you.
You know...
Imroth was not joking
when he said he had a lot of enemies.
This is going to take all night
to get through this.
- I think I'm gonna take my half home.
- That's a good idea.
You really surprised me today
at Imroth's office.
The way you reacted
when he got in your face.
The guy was having a rough day.
I was trying to be diplomatic.
I mean, considering
what we suspect him of.
Because he brought up the Marked,
and you didn't even...
well, pursue it.
Neither did you.
It's not like he was
going to admit to anything.
I promise, the next time
he gives us some attitude,
you'll see
some fireworks, okay?
Good night.
Did you...
get the results
of the cat-scan?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Hello?
- Hello.
Hi, Kevin.
I'm back.
Out here.
See me?
Come find me.
I thought you weren't
coming back for a few days.
Kevin, I'm over here.
Where are you?
You found me.
I brought your breakfast.
Come on.
Orders are you're supposed to eat.
Let her go!
We're not supposed
to hurt her.
Morning, Diana.
Read any good
death threats lately?
Too many.
So, what do we got,
like, 8 000 suspects?
Good luck
tracking them all down.
So how was your night?
It was kind of strange.
I was on my way home
when I got a phone call
from Drew Imroth.
Yeah, I know,
it threw me, too.
Anyway, he told me
he had to see me right away,
alone at Madison park.
It all felt a little...
cloak and dagger,
but what was I gonna do?
- I guess you had to go.
- Exactly.
Turns out, he wants me
to pass the case off to another agent.
He's worried that I'm still obsessed
about proving he's one of the Marked.
What did you tell him?
The truth. That he had
nothing to worry about.
That I'd do my job
to the best of my abilities.
Then I asked him to name
every member of the marked,
which led to some of the fireworks
you were hoping for.
I better take this.
I'll see you in there.
Baldwin...
When?
Is Isabelle all right?
Fine. I'll have
to make an excuse here.
I'll be right over.
What happened?
Where's kevin?
I don't know. The cleaning
staff came in this morning.
This is how they found the place.
All his work is missing, too.
This was Jordan.
It had to be.
He knows about the compatibility test.
It's so strange.
All those people willing to risk
their lives to get an ability.
Thinking it'll make them
feel less alone,
more powerful.
I never felt more alone
and less powerful
than when I had
limitless abilities.
It overwhelmed my entire life.
Became my identity,
cut me off from everyone...
My parents...
Shawn...
It's only when I lost everything
that I found myself,
and now you want me
to go back there,
- become that person again.
- That person is who you are.
It won't be that bad, Isabelle.
These past few months,
you got a little vacation,
you spent a little time
out in the world,
but now it's time
to go back to work.
It was nice to be normal...
At least for a little while.
Okay,
so this is a modification
of a document authorization program
Abigail designed
while she was at M.I.T.
We used it to cross-reference
the language
in the anti-Ubient manifesto
with the hate mail
directed at Drew Imroth.
We were looking for
idiosyncratic phrases
and word choices
with a high degree of similarity
in both documents.
Now, you can see
whoever wrote the manifesto
likes to use semi-colons
by the handful.
He's also fond of "who" or "which"
instead of "that",
and he refers to Imroth
as "Mr. Puppetmaster",
a phrase he repeats
a total of 6 times.
And... what do we find
in the hate mail department?
This document.
Semi-colons.
"Who" and "which" used again
instead of "that",
and finally, our old friend,
"Mr. Puppetmaster".
So the two authors
are one and the same.
Do you have a name for us?
This e-mail is signed "Swindled".
Imroth put his people on it.
They traced it
to a Warren Trask.
Turns out,
back in the early '80s,
Trask designed
a primitive version
of the <i>Enzyme</i> operating system.
When Imroth came out with
a very similar program,
- Trask sued.
- Let me guess. He lost.
No, no, it never
went to court.
Imroth offered Trask
an out-of-court settlement.
Trask wound up with $100,000.
Meanwhile,
<i>Enzyme</i> has made Imroth billions.
- So the guy's pissed.
- Wouldn't you be?
You can ask him yourself.
He lives right here in seattle.
Well, nice work, Marco.
Actually, it was all Abigail.
She buy you that suit, too?
Stop looking so freaked out.
We're almost there.
I told you I can't stay long.
- If my mom finds out...
- She won't.
I promised you
a birthday surprise, right?
Well, here it is.
Mom?
Dad?
Maia, is it really you?
Vic, can you believe
how big she's gotten?
She's still
my little girl.
I only wish I could give you
a great, big birthday hug.
Me too.
But you can't.
You're just somebody's
4400 ability.
Whatever we are,
we're your parents,
and we love you so much.
Excuse me.
I'm agent Baldwin,
this is agent Skouris. We're with NTAC.
We're here to see
Warren Trask.
I'm his daughter, Eileen.
- What's this all about?
- We'd like to ask your father
some questions
about Drew Imroth.
Well, you can ask him
anything you want.
Just don't expect any answers.
My dad had a stroke
three months ago.
He hasn't moved a muscle
nor said a word since.
My father was a brilliant man,
but he was naive and trusting,
and Drew Imroth
took advantage of that
to cheat my father
out of his life's work.
His career, his marriage,
his... health.
My father lost it all.
So when did he take
the promicin shot?
About six months ago.
As far as I know,
it didn't do anything,
no ability, nothing, and then
he had the aneurysm.
Do you really still believe
he's behind
what's happening to Ubient?
All these machines
he's hooked up to,
they're run by computer,
so he's connected to networks
for emergency response
monitoring.
If his mind is still functioning and
he's got an ability, then, yeah...
he could be
the ghost in the machine.
Well, that would be...
wonderful.
Daddy,
if that's true,
I am so happy for you.
Don't stop until you ruin Imroth
like he ruined you.
That's enough of that.
- You're hurting me.
- Tom, let her go.
She's an accessory
to a half-dozen felonies.
If there is anything you are holding
back, you'd better tell us now.
I don't know anything,
but if my father
is bringing down Drew Imroth,
I'd consider that justice.
Am I mistaken, or am I looking
at a xerces blue butterfly?
I believe
that's what it's called.
The xerces blue
has been extinct since 1941.
Not here.
Not anymore.
We have a resident
who can modify DNA
to recreate
extinct species.
Only insects so far, but he hopes
to work his way up to mammals.
I don't know about you, but I'd love
to see a woolly mammoth in the flesh.
I'm impressed...
And I'm not easily impressed.
A man of your intelect
could do just about anything
here in promise city.
Which might be
a more persuasive argument
if I weren't a kidnap victim
being held against my will.
It was my idea to bring you here.
Jordan knew nothing about it.
Is that supposed to make
everything all right?
Kyle's method
might have been extreme,
but I can't fault his motive,
you belong here...
in Promise City,
with us, Kevin.
You are the father
of the promicin movement.
Without your discoveries,
Promise City wouldn't even exist.
I made
a scientific breakthrough...
But I didn't start
a religious cult.
Kevin, like it or not,
you're revered by everyone here.
However, I cannot allow
your research to continue.
A promicin compatibility test
would be death to this movement.
All I'm trying to do
is save lives, Jordan.
So are we.
We're just thinking
a little more long-term.
So...
Until you share our vision,
I'm afraid I'll have to insist
you remain our guest.
Tomorrow at 8:00 A.M.? I was kind
of hoping for something sooner.
No, no, we can't prove conclusively
that Trask's our man,
but we know he took
the promicin shot.
Okay, if that's
the best you can do.
Okay, thanks.
We can't get a court order to move
Trask to NTAC medical till morning.
But Ubient is hemmoraging
millions of dollars an hour.
The stock market is down
over 500 points,
I don't know about you, but my
pension plan is pretty much history.
We've done all we can
to isolate him.
We've cut off the phone services
and internet to his home.
We don't even know if he needs
a phone line to access the net.
We need to get Trask
on the inhibitor,
- and we need to do it now.
- It's not an option.
His doctors have ruled it out.
Given the state of his health,
it's way too risky.
Well, maybe
it's worth the risk.
Just keeping Trask
under wraps at NTAC
is no guarantee that the attacks
against Ubient will stop.
What are you suggesting, Tom,
we kill him?
Of course not!
It's just... Look,
it's just frustrating, for all of us.
Anyhow, I guess there's nothing
we can do till morning.
Hey, birthday girl, I'm home!
Why aren't you dressed yet?
The dinner reservation's for 7:00.
I'll be ready in time.
Then we come home
and open the presents, all right?
That'll be good.
What's wrong?
Did something happen today?
I told you not to get
your hopes up about Ben.
I told you, I'm past all that.
That's good,
because I don't know about you,
but I'm ready
for some birthday cake.
So lets get going, okay?
- Yeah?
- <i>It's me.</i>
Tell me you've got good news.
Because at this rate, Ubient software
will cease to exist in three days,
which means we lose
all our financial backing,
<i>not to mention
our spyware program.</i>
I get it.
Don't worry.
I'm taking care of it.
<i>I hope so.</i>
Oh, my god, daddy?
Daddy?
Come on!
Come on.
Half a dozen residents
claimed they heard the crash.
- But nobody saw anything?
- Apparently not.
Morning.
Court order
come through yet?
Uh, yes, it did.
Not that it matters anymore.
- Why not? What's going on?
- Last night, someone stole a car
and plowed it
into a telephone pole
a few blocks
from Warren Trask's house.
Blacked out
the entire neighborhood.
Life support system shut down.
It ran on battery power for a while,
but we had his daughter's
cell phone jammed.
By the time she got
to a phone that worked...
Trask's dead?
Try not to sound
so broken up about it.
I'm just surprised, that's all.
What about the attacks
on Ubient?
As of this morning,
Ubient software is running virus-free.
Seems Imroth's company
is going to survive,
and so's the economy.
Stock market's already up 200 points.
Weird way for things to work out,
but I guess we'll take it.
Yeah, we all got lucky,
except for Warren Trask.
What happened to your head?
Oh, I banged it
on the medicine cabinet
in the middle of the night.
Next time I'll turn on the light.
Good idea.
You have five minutes, Shawn.
Tell me what you want.
I want you to release Kevin Burkhoff.
Don't tell me he's not here.
Dr. Burkhoff is here.
He's my guest,
and he'll remain that way
for the time being.
Tell me, Jordan,
since when did kidnapping
become part of this
new religion of yours?
That seems like a pretty twisted way
to bring the world closer to god.
You want to get back
in my good graces?
It's simple.
Hold another press conference,
announce you've had a change of heart,
and that you now support
the taking of promicin.
You know I can't do that.
Then Kevin Burkhoff
remains my guest,
and you...
You're no longer welcome
in Promise City.
Goodbye, shawn.
How is my girl feeling?
Like I'm going to die.
Ah, it's just
your body ridding itself
of the anti-promicin
allergens.
It's all part of the process.
Look this way.
There you go.
Now...
It's time for the next step.
Don't.
It's okay, Isabelle.
In a few seconds, you are
going to feel a lot better.
You see?
That wasn't so bad.
Oh, and...
Isabelle, I know
what you're thinking.
Once your abilities return,
you're gonna use them against me.
It worked once before
when you murdered Matthew Ross,
but I wouldn't try it again.
This time, we're not
taking any chances.
We placed a deterrent inside you
while you were in prison.
Call it a... kill switch.
If you move against me,
or disobey me in any way,
it will be activated, and you will die.
Now, you just...
rest for another hour or so,
and when you get up,
you'll be the most
powerful person on the planet...
Again.
So, what do we have?
The lab ran
the test you asked for.
The glass sample they pulled
was pretty degraded.
It's going to take a couple of days
to get conclusive results,
but we do have
the preliminary results.
I'm sorry, Diana,
but there's about an 80% chance
the blood belongs to Tom Baldwin.
These last few weeks, I could tell
there was something wrong.
It's like he was the same guy,
but different, you know?
And I kept telling myself,
"it's okay, it's still Tom."
Well, I didn't want to
believe it either.
He's been my partner
and my friend for years.
Talk about
sleeping with the enemy.
I don't know if he told you,
but... Tom and I...
No, he didn't,
but the possibility
had crossed my mind.
Okay, so we're past that.
The question is,
what do we do now, Diana?
Well, we have to find a way
to get the real Tom Baldwin back,
and we can't let him suspect
that we know anything.
We just to have to
force ourselves
to act like
nothing's changed.
That's not going to
be a problem in the office,
but outside, I mean...
It's not going to be easy.
The physical intimacy thing, I'm...
I'm not sure I can handle it.
So you two got it all
figured out?
Whatever it is
you're talking about.
Tom, what are you doing
in the office so late?
Just catching up
on some loose ends.
- What about you guys?
- Just... just the same.
You know, I was thinking about
catching a bite. Who's with me?
I can't.
I'm supposed to be at my dad's.
Oh, I got to get home.
Well, I'm just going to
finish up here.
- You two have a good night.
- Yeah, you too.
Good night.
I have to say,
you did wonderful work.
With Trask out of the way,
the company
has finally rebounded.
The next two fiscal quarters
will be shaky at best,
but thanks to you,
Ubient lives.
You're not celebrating.
what's wrong?
One of the last things
Trask did
was spread your personal data
all over the internet.
Names, phone records,
financial statements.
They're all out there
for all eyes to see...
To study.
It could lead to
some very dangerous questions.
So, we do damage control.
Delete all we can
and deny the rest.
That'll only feed
the conspiracy theorists.
So it's been decided, Drew.
We're going to have to take
a more radical approach.
What do you have in mind?
Hi, mom!
Hi, dad!
Hello, sweetheart.
did you have a fun birthday?
Pretty fun.
I just... wish you
could have been there.
- So do we.
- I'll bet you got some nice gifts.
I got a new iPod.
It's like a record player,
only it plays
thousands of songs.
- Any Sinatra?
- Tons of Sinatra.
Next time I come,
I'll bring it with me.
Are you sure
you can get away?
You know, we wouldn't
want to interfere
with any homework
or anything.
You're not interfering.
I like coming here
and seeing you.
I wish I could
come every day.
So do we.
But you're here now.
Jordan's never
going to let Kevin go.
So that's it? The compatibility test
isn't going to happen?
It has to happen.
I have to make it happen.
Get on the phone,
get ahold of Tess.
We're taking Kevin
out of Promise City.
It's all settled.
He understands
what he has to do.
He may have been
a little disappointed at first.
After all, he had a good run,
<i>but in the end, he took it well.</i>
<i>He knows it's time to move on.</i>
<i>I'm sure he considers it
an honor...</i>
Especially after he heard about
the new host we have lined up for him.
<i>He made an excellent
Drew Imroth,</i>
but he'll make an even better
Jordan Collier.

- à nos côtés.
- <i>Depuis quand le kidnapping
fait-il partie
de ta nouvelle religion ?
Un test de compatibilité à la promicine
signerait l'arrêt de mort du mouvement.
Jordan aurait dû enterrer
tout ça quelque part.
Mais fais-moi plaisir...
et attends un peu.
Qu'en est-il de la conspiration,
Curtis ? Et des Marqués ?
J'ai tout inventé.
Ils vous ont eu.
Ils vous ont acheté !
Je pense qu'il est probable
que la Directrice des Renseignements
soit marquée.
<i>Tu ne te sens pas différent ?
<i>Tu veux dire,
comme un Marqué ?
Un zombie dirigé
par un être du futur ?
Vous n'êtes pas Tom Baldwin.
La promicine est maudite.
Et maudits soient ceux qui en prennent.
Ils ne veulent pas changer le monde,
mais y mettre fin. Tu peux les arrêter.
Que fait-on, Diana ?
Il faut retrouver
le vrai Tom Baldwin.
<i>Des fois,
j'ai l'impression que Tom sait tout.
<i>Parfois, lorsque je travaille,
il m'observe comme si...
me sondait, cherchant à savoir
si je le suspecte.
Je vois, et on est censé faire
comme si rien n'avait changé.
Je sors avec lui. Chaque fois
qu'il pose la main sur moi, je dois...
m'empêcher de trembler.
Ça ne peut pas durer indéfiniment.
Tôt ou tard,
il réalisera
qu'on sait qu'il est marqué.
Il nous faut...
trouver un moyen
de le libérer de cette chose.
Toute cette eau.
Pas facile de s'habituer, hein ?
Ils vont tout polluer.
Ils ne savent pas tirer profit
des ressources à leur disposition.
Isabelle est dans la Ville Promise.
Dès qu'elle approchera de Collier,
elle agira.
Elle ne doit pas
lui faire de mal, hein ?
Bon. Il y a autre chose
dont j'aimerais que vous vous occupiez.
Un problème potentiel.
La fille de votre partenaire,
Maia Skouris...
Si elle a la mauvaise vision
au mauvais moment...
Ça pourrait compliquer les choses.
Je m'en charge.
<i>On ne sait même pas
comment ils marquent quelqu'un...
Alors, de là à savoir comment
en débarrasser quelqu'un...
Sans en savoir plus,
je ne vois pas quoi faire.
Il y a bien quelqu'un...
qui en sait plus sur Les Marqués
que nous.
Partante pour un voyage au Canada ?
Coupez !
C'est dans la boîte.
Parfait !
Curtis, on devrait refaire la prise.
Il y avait une ombre de caméra sur...
Ne t'inquiète pas,
on arrangera ça au montage.
Je vais dans ma caravane,
prépare la suite.
J'ai des trucs à arranger
dans cette scène.
Phil...
Super boulot, Phil !
Bonjour, Curtis.
Asseyez-vous.
On a des questions à vous poser.
À quel sujet ?
Quel type d'objectif
vous utilisez...
Vous imaginez quoi, Curtis ?
On veut vous parler des Marqués.
Je vous l'ai déjà dit,
j'ai tout inventé.
Les Marqués n'existent pas.
J'ai du travail.
Si vous voulez me voir tourner,
je peux vous donner des casques.
Vous ne retournerez pas
travailler de sitôt.
Tout ce que nous voulons savoir,
c'est comment éliminer ces choses.

Vous ne devriez même pas être ici.
C'est dangereux.
Je suis presque sûr
qu'on me surveille en permanence.
Donc, vous admettez
que Les Marqués existent.
C'est très simple.
Dites-nous ce qu'on veut savoir,
et nous partons.
Comment extraire
une de ces choses de quelqu'un ?
Je ne sais même pas
si c'est possible.
J'ai brûlé mon scénario,
mais il y avait une scène
que j'avais déjà écrite.
Celle où ils marquaient
Matthew Ross.
Ils injectaient un liquide étrange
dans sa colonne vertébrale.
C'est comme ça
qu'ils doivent prendre le contrôle.
Tous les personnages...
ils parlaient tout le temps de ces...
micromachines contenues
dans le liquide.
Micromachines ?
- Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
- Écoutez, je suis réalisateur, pas...
scientifique.
Tu es seule ?
J'aime venir ici le matin.
C'est agréable.
Tu t'appelles comment ?
Sophia.
Tu peux faire quoi ?
Qu'as-tu de spécial, Sophia ?
Vous savez qu'on a cinq sens ?
Je peux les modifier.
Je peux rendre n'importe qui
plus fort ou faible.
Alors, si tu le voulais...
tu pourrais rendre quelqu'un
aveugle, ou sourd ?
Sophia, ça te dirait
de venir avec moi ?
Shawn, voici Sophia.
Elle est très gentille.
Elle va nous aider.
Très bien.
Je pense que tu as rassemblé
assez de gens.
On sait où ils retiennent Kevin.
Allons le chercher
avant qu'ils se réveillent tous.
Prêt à sortir d'ici ?
Merci d'être venu.
J'étais privé
de graines de tournesol.
C'était perturbant.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- J'allais jusqu'à l'arrêt de bus.
- Où est maman ?
- Je travaille seul aujourd'hui.
Diana m'a dit qu'elle avait
des courses à faire.
Je vais dans ta direction.
Je t'emmène ?
- Bien sûr.
- Super.
C'est bizarre, hein ?
La façon dont on s'est rencontré.
Pour être honnête, Maia,
ce n'était pas un hasard.
Je voulais te parler de ta mère.
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
C'est sûrement
sans importance, mais...
Elle a un comportement bizarre.
Ça doit être le stress.
Tu as remarqué quelque chose ?
Pas vraiment.
Je pense
qu'elle travaille beaucoup.
Elle parle souvent
avec votre nouveau chef.
Elle vient même ici le soir, parfois.
Vraiment ?
Je pourrais avoir un peu de glace
avec le soda ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
- Merci.
Et tes visions, Maia ?
Tu as vu des choses étranges
récemment ?
- Rien du tout ?
- Non, juste...
- Juste des petits trucs.
- Ah ouais ?
Merci.
Attends, santé !
J'ai pas bu de bière de racine
depuis longtemps.
C'est bon.
Bon, je pense
qu'il n'y a rien de grave.
Mais, tu sais, rends-moi service.
Ne...
Ne parle pas à ta mère
de cette conversation.
Qu'elle ne pense pas
que je m'inquiète pour elle.
D'accord.
- Tu es fatiguée, ma puce ?
- Un peu.
Va donc faire une sieste.
Je retrouverai mon chemin.
D'accord.
À plus.
À bientôt.
C'est fait.
Je lui ai injecté
une forte dose d'inhibiteur.
Elle n'aura plus de visions
pendant quelques semaines.
Je veux que ce soit rapide.
On doit entrer et ressortir du Centre
aussi vite que Shawn
dans la Ville Promise.
Au rez-de-chaussée...
Par l'entrée arrière,
celle qui donne sur la roseraie.
Les deux équipes
se séparent dans le hall...
<i>Les deux équipes
se séparent dans le hall...
Que se passe-t-il ?
Pourquoi ces gardes
qui le suivent ?
Shawn est entré dans la Ville Promise
avec d'autres 4400.
Ils ont emmené Kevin Burkhoff.
Vous n'allez pas lui faire de mal ?
Shawn doit comprendre
qu'il ne doit pas s'opposer à nous.
La situation va devenir un peu...
tendue pendant quelque temps.
Je dois y retourner.
Je passerai te voir après, d'accord ?
Curtis Peck a quitté l'école
en seconde.
On peut partir du principe qu'il
a peu de connaissances scientifiques.
Mais s'il parle de micromachines
dans le liquide rachidien,
il ne peut y avoir
qu'une seule explication.
- Des nanites.
- Nanotechnologie ?
C'est ça.
Des machines microscopiques.
- Des micromachines.
- Attends...
Je n'ai pas lu les derniers numéros
de <i>Scientific American,
mais à ce que je sais,
les nanites sont purement théoriques.
- Ça n'existe pas.
- Pas encore.
Pas à notre connaissance.
Si quelqu'un est marqué,
une nouvelle personnalité
remplace l'ancienne.
Comment cela se passe-t-il ?
Des nanites.
D'une façon ou d'une autre,
la personnalité du...
type du futur
est encodée dans ces micromachines.
Elles sont injectées dans
le liquide cérébrospinal d'un autre.
Elles se reproduisent,
et quand il y en a assez...
- On est marqué.
- Comment détruire des nanites ?
Aucune idée.
Officiellement,
personne n'en a fabriqué,
et encore moins cherché
à les supprimer !
Salut.
Garrity m'a dit que vous étiez ici.
Je voulais me joindre à la fête.
Tu avais un problème de...
d'immobilier.
- Tu es déjà revenue.
- Oui, j'ai...
visité quelque chose à <i>Lynwood.
On discutait des avantages
et inconvénients de...
la banlieue.
Ce type à l'air mal en point.
Il doit être citadin.
C'était là quand on est arrivé.
Où étais-tu ?
Je bossais sur une affaire.
Il y avait des rumeurs sur
un réseau de distribution de promicine
au collège de <i>Northmount.
Je suis allé fouiner un peu.
Bon, je ferais mieux de remonter.
Bref, tout dépend de ta volonté à faire
un long trajet tous les jours.
Jordan est quelqu'un
de très obstiné.
Il ne va pas tarder
à contre-attaquer.
Peut-être devrions-nous partir ?
- Shawn sera sauf si on s'en va.
- Non, vous n'irez nulle part.
Collier a prouvé que s'il le veut,
il vous trouvera.
Donc cet endroit
est aussi bien qu'un autre.
Il y a des 4400
qui nous soutiennent,
même des gens
qui ont pris une dose.
Ils veulent vous protéger.
Donc, que Collier vienne,
nous serons prêts.
- Shawn, désolé de vous déranger...
- Pas grave.
Votre frère et votre mère
vous en attendent en bas.
OK... Je reviens de suite.
Salut, maman.
Salut, Danny.
Je sais qu'on n'a pas rendez-vous,
mais nous prenions un café
avec ton frère,
et on s'est dit
qu'on pourrait passer.
Je suis content.
C'est bon de vous voir.
C'est juste que, maintenant...
C'est pas le bon moment ?
Tu vois, je te l'avais dit.
Je sais que je dis tout le temps ça,
mais là ça tombe vraiment mal.
OK, j'ai compris.
Je voulais juste te voir.
Je passerai ce week-end.
- On dînera ensemble.
- Bien.
Je te ferai appeler
par mon personnel.
OK. D'accord.
J'attendrai cet appel.
J'arrive tout de suite,
OK, maman ?
Joanna, vous pouvez nous laisser
une seconde ?
- Bien sûr.
- Merci. Au revoir, maman.
Alors, je t'ai vu aux infos.
Tu parlais de ce test
de compatibilité à la promicine.
Oui, on y travaille.
Je veux le passer.
Shawn, j'évite de prendre une dose
depuis des mois.
Je m'étais résigné,
mais ce test change tout.
Je pourrais savoir
si c'est risqué ou pas.
C'est que le test n'est pas
tout à fait prêt, Danny.
Oui, mais c'est pas loin, pas vrai ?
Je veux juste une idée
de mes chances.
Pas d'école demain.
Tu as 38,5°C de fièvre.
Depuis quand te sens-tu mal ?
Cet après-midi.
Oh, chérie.
À l'école ?
Non.
En revenant de l'école en bus.
Tiens, prends ça...
Et on reprendra ta température
demain matin.
C'est qui ?
Désolé de passer sans prévenir,
mais j'ai parlé longuement
avec un pote d'université.
Il travaille pour la NASA.
Je lui ai demandé comment
repousser une infection de nanites.
- Au début, il a bien rigolé.
- Et quand il est devenu sérieux ?
Il a dit que c'était
théoriquement possible.
Les nanites, si elles existaient,
auraient une structure moléculaire,
et donc que leurs liens chimiques
sont brisables.
OK, comment ?
Voilà où ça devient hasardeux.
Mon ami a dit que le seul moyen sûr
de détruire toutes les nanites,
serait d'exposer le sujet
à une substance hautement radioactive.
Comme du polonium.
Quelle dose de radiation ?
Environ 50 nano grammes
devraient suffir.
- Tom mourrait.
- Je sais.
Si on veut tuer ce qu'il a en lui,
nous devrons tuer Tom aussi.
Donc Diana Skouris
était bien une passagère
de votre vol pour Vancouver, hier ?
Vous pouvez voir si une Meghan Doyle
était sur le même vol ?
Elle y était.
Merci.
Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- Du nouveau ?
À vrai dire, oui.
Une info sur l'affaire
de promicine dans un lycée.
Une étudiante nommée
Penelope Rice a appelé.
Elle a dit que son professeur
d'études sur la paix
leur a donné un cours
encourageant la prise de doses.
Tu penses qu'il en donne
à ses étudiants ?
Je pense que ça coûte rien
d'aller voir.
C'est toi qui conduis.
Tu viens ?
Tu as passé cette radio, hier ?
J'ai dû utiliser le nom de Shawn,
mais ils m'ont pris, oui.
Tu as un beau cerveau,
mais j'ai peur que tu ne puisses
m'aider avec le test de compatibilité.
Je comprends pas.
Pourquoi ?
Peu importe. Il vient de te dire
que tu ne peux pas en prendre.
Non, ce n'est pas ce que j'ai dit.
À ce jour, le test est quasiment
terminé.
J'affine encore mes recherches
sur qui survivra ou pas.
Je peux déjà y répondre
pour 90% de la population.
Ce sont ces 10% du milieu
qui m'intéressent.
Je dois trouver la frontière exacte
entre la mort et la survie.
Toi...
Toi tu sors statistiquement du lot.
Vois par toi-même.
Tu as un corps calleux
très développé.
Un des plus gros que j'ai jamais vu.
Donc mes chances de survie
sont bonnes ?
Excellentes.
Je dirais que prendre une dose
ne représente
aucun risque pour toi.
Je le savais.
T'as entendu ?
J'ai un corps calleux
très développé.
Je ne gagne pas de temps.
<i>Collier est cerné par ses
gardes du corps</i>
<i>Je ne peux pas l'approcher.</i>
- J'ai du mal à te croire.
<i>- C'est vrai.
<i>Je sais même pas
si je peux atteindre Collier,</i>
et repartir seule avec lui.
Isabelle, tu peux faire
ce que tu veux à Collier.
S'il te dit le contraire,
c'est qu'il bluffe.
<i>Tu oublies combien tu es forte,</i>
ou peut-être juste
que tu te dégonfles.
Tu aimerais pouvoir
fraterniser avec eux,
<i>que le temps passé avec eux
avait de la valeur.</i>
- C'était le cas.
<i>- Plus important que ton père ?
Tu dois le faire.
Tu as 24 heures.
Ça va ?
Rien d'important.
Des affaires de famille.
Ton informatrice étudiante
était un coup dans l'eau.
Elle nous a appelé
parce qu'elle en voulait à son prof'.
Il lui a donné un "C"
pour son semestre.
On pourrait lui poser des questions.
Ça coûte rien.
Et lesquelles ?
Pourquoi il note aussi durement ?
Non, on ferait mieux de rentrer.
Je dois partir plus tôt
aujourd'hui.
Oh, mon Dieu,
vous êtes l'un d'eux.
Vous êtes marqué.
- C'est ce qu'elles vous ont dit ?
- Qui ça ?
Skouris, Doyle.
Je sais qu'elles sont venues.
Je veux juste terminer mon film.
Si on voulait votre mort,
ce serait fait depuis un moment.
On veut savoir
ce qu'elles vous ont dit.
Ont-elles dit que je suis marqué ?
Non, elles n'ont pas
parlé de vous du tout.
Elles m'ont juste demandé comment
se débarrasser de ces trucs,
s'il y avait un moyen
de retirer la marque d'un marqué.
Alors, elles vont essayer
de sauver Tom Baldwin.
Je ne sais pas,
mais je n'ai rien à voir là-dedans.
Je ne leur ai rien dit !
C'est bon.
Tout va bien.
C'est bon...
Je ne vous en veux pas, Curtis.
Nous devons juste être prudent,
c'est tout.
Que vous ont-elles demandé d'autre ?
Rien.
C'est tout ce dont nous avons parlé.
Je peux rentrer maintenant ?
Je vous ai dit, je n'ai rien dit.
Que faites-vous ?
Vous êtes réalisateur.
Vous devriez apprécier ça.
Appelez ça...
"Corriger une erreur de scénario."
Tom, que fais-tu ?
Tu m'as fait peur, Diana.
Il est minuit passé.
Pourquoi es-tu encore là ?
J'étais dans la salle des théories
et là je m'en vais.
Alors, qu'y a-t-il ?
Je ramène juste un peu de boulot
à la maison.
- C'est beaucoup de boulot.
- Oui.
Bonne nuit, chérie.
Tu sais, Tom, je ne peux pas
te laisser sortir ces dossiers.
Pourquoi ça ?
OK, il y a pas mal de trucs sensibles,
mais il s'agit de toi et moi, Diana.
On ramène tout le temps du travail.
Rien de grave, pas vrai ?
Vous êtes vraiment mauvais.
Je sais pas ce qu'on vous apprend
en cours de détournement de corps...
mais vous êtes un piètre Tom Baldwin.
Si peu convaincant.
Très drôle, Diana.
Mais j'ai pas le temps de rire...
Tu es un marqué, Tom.
Je le sais.
Meghan aussi le sait.
Admettons une seconde,
que j'en sois un.
Te rends-tu compte
combien il serait dur
de prétendre travailler ici ?
Vous êtes tous faibles, hésitants.
On est des êtres humains.
Je ne sais pas comment
on a pu évoluer en vous.
Moi non plus.
Moi non plus.
Regarde-toi, Diana.
Tu ne sais pas ce que tu veux.
Tu as éconduit chaque homme
ayant posé les yeux sur toi.
Ta fille t'a apportée sur un plateau
un fiancé par prophétie,
et tu n'as même pas pu le garder.
Ta plus longue relation avec un mec ?
C'est avec moi.
Ton vieux copain, Tom Baldwin.
Je suis son amie,
et je ne lui demanderai
même pas d'excuses
lorsque je vous aurais
extirpé de lui.
Tu as besoin de repos, Diana.
- Tu commences à délirer.
- Pose le carton par terre, Tom.
Diana, qu'est-ce que...
Bien.
Que fais-tu là ?
Tu n'es jamais venu me voir.
Désolé, j'ai été retenu
avec Jordan.
Ça va ?
J'ai pas envie d'être seule ce soir.
OK, tu peux rester ici.
Et je n'ai pas non plus
envie de parler.
Tu es sûre
de ne pas vouloir de docteur ?
Je vais bien, Marco.
La police de Vancouver
vient de m'appeler.
Curtis Peck a été retrouvé mort
il y a quelques heures.
- Oh, mon Dieu.
- Ils pensent à un cambriolage.
Je ne leur ai pas laissé
penser le contraire.
Dieu seul sait
ce qu'il va faire ensuite.
Je ne veux pas faire monter
encore plus la pression, mais...
si nous voulons guérir Tom,
il faut agir vite.
Mon pote m'a refilé
un échantillon de polonium,
mais il se dégrade vite.
Dans 2 jours, il sera inutile.
Tom sait qu'on le cherche.
Il ne se pointera jamais au NTAC.
Il faut trouver un moyen
de le faire venir à nous.
J'ai toujours eu
horreur des aiguilles.
Ça va ?
Ouais, je me sens bien.
Ça ne veut pas dire
que tout va bien.
On va te surveiller
pendant quelque temps, OK ?
Mais je vais bien.
Tu es en train de te demander
quelle aptitude tu vas avoir.
Un deuxième guérisseur
pourrait être utile, non ?
Kyle, réveille-toi.
T'as bien dormi ?
J'ai pas fermé l'?il de la nuit.
Je dois y aller.
C'est l'heure.
L'heure de quoi ?
Tu vas t'endormir pendant un moment,
et quand tu te réveilleras,
tout sera différent.
De quoi tu parles ?
Je veux que tu saches,
que mes sentiments pour toi
étaient sincères.
Tu es le seul véritable ami
que j'ai jamais eu.
Isabelle, tu vas bien ?
Pendant un temps,
j'ai cru que tu avais changé.
Moi aussi.
Maia, chérie, tu dois te lever.
Comment tu te sens ?
- Un peu mieux.
- OK.
Mais je ne pourrai pas aller à l'école.
C'est pas grave,
mais tu dois t'habiller,
on va te faire un petit sac,
parce qu'on va partir un petit moment.
Où ça ?
Eh bien... à l'hôtel.
- Qu'est-ce que tu as à l'?il ?
- C'est... Je vais bien.
On va simplement partir d'ici,
on y est plus en sécurité.
Je ne veux pas t'effrayer,
mais c'est...
C'est Tom. Il...
Il a quelque chose de mauvais en lui,
et il n'est plus lui-même. D'accord ?
Alors on se dépêche,
on doit y aller.
Je comprends pas.
C'est ce que Tom a dit sur toi.
Comment ?
Quand ?
Il y a deux jours,
il est venu me chercher à l'école.
Il y a deux jours ?
Juste avant que tu commences
à te sentir mal, c'est ça ?
Réveillez-le.
Qu'attendez-vous de moi ?
Bonjour, Jordan.
On dirait qu'on va finir par collaborer,
vous et moi.
Ça ne vous apportera rien de me tuer.
Le mouvement est bien trop fort.
Il continuera sans moi.
Qui a dit qu'on voulait vous tuer ?
C'est un sédatif.
Nous n'allons pas faire de vous
un martyr, Jordan.
Nous allons faire de vous un traître.
Vous allez dormir un moment,
et quand vous vous réveillerez,
il y aura quelque chose en vous,
et avec le temps,
vous finirez par penser comme nous.
Un Jordan Collier flambant neuf...
Un homme inquiet de protéger le futur,
et non plus le détruire.
Vous oubliez une chose,
j'ai vu le monde que vous avez créé,
les océans n'étaient plus que
des déserts d'os
des incendies partout à l'horizon,
et partout où je passais,
des hurlements.
Nous avons hérité de ce monde-là,
et nous avons réussi à survivre,
- et même à prospérer.
- Vous n'avez fait que
vous cacher derrière un mur
pendant que le reste de la planète
agonisait autour.
Quoi que vous fassiez,
votre futur n'existera plus.65
Le monde devient positif.
Vous avez raison, Jordan.
Nous sommes impuissants...
Mais pas vous.
Vous pouvez extraire la promicine
des gens.
Vous rendez les positifs, négatifs.
Votre aptitude, Jordan,
c'est comme ça que nous allons gagner.
Une fois marqué, vous rassemblerez
tous vos adeptes,
et un par un,
vous leur retirerez leur aptitude,
et vous n'arrêterez pas avant d'avoir
débarrassé le monde de la promicine.
Regardez-moi ça,
Jordan Collier reste sans voix.
Admirez la symétrie de la chose.
Vous allez à vous seul détruire
le mouvement que vous avez créé.
Tu m'as menti.
T'as dit qu'on avait besoin d'Isabelle,
qu'elle avait changé.
J'ai dit que
tu devais la conduire à Collier,
qu'elle faisait partie de tout ça,
et c'est le cas.
Elle fait ce qu'elle a à faire.
Tu dois faire pareil.
Comment ? Jordan est parti.
Tout est en train de s'écrouler.
Tu ne dois pas laisser ça arriver.
Quelqu'un doit être responsable
de la Ville Promise.
Moi ?
- Allô ?
<i>- Tom, c'est moi, Maia.</i>
Maia, salut.
- Tout va bien ?
<i>- Pas vraiment.</i>
C'est ma mère.
Je m'inquiète pour elle.
Elle est bizarre.
- Comment ça ?
- <i>Elle m'a emmenée dans cet hôtel.</i>
<i>Elle a dit que quelque chose
n'allait pas chez toi.</i>
Ce n'est pas vrai, Maia.
Désolé qu'elle t'ait dit ça.
Elle a dit autre chose ?
<i>Non.</i>
Te fâche pas,
mais quand tu es venu me voir,
je t'ai pas dit la vérité.
J'ai eu une vision la semaine dernière.
Vous y étiez, ma mère et toi.
C'était horrible.
<i>C'est bon, Maia, quoi que ce soit,
ce n'est pas encore arrivé.</i>
<i>Dis-moi ce que tu as vu.</i>
Ma mère, elle avait un pistolet,
et vous vous disputiez.
Et puis elle t'a tiré dessus.
<i>J'ai rien dit quand t'es venu me voir,</i>
<i>parce que je pensais pas
que ça se réaliserait.</i>
Mais j'en suis plus certaine,
maintenant.
Où ça s'est passé ?
Il me faut des détails.
<i>Je sais pas.</i>
<i>Elle serait vraiment en colère
si elle savait que je t'appelais.</i>
Fais attention, d'accord ?
Et s'il te plaît,
ne lui fais pas de mal.
Dis-moi à quoi ressemblait l'endroit,
Maia...
Tu as raté le déjeuner.
C'est vrai ?
Il fait encore jour ?
Il est 15h.
Kevin, je sais que ce test
te prend beaucoup de temps, mais...
On dirait que depuis que Shawn
m'a guérie, je ne te vois plus.
Tu m'évites ?
En fait, oui.
Autant que possible.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que tu vas bien, maintenant,
et...
tu es jeune...
et... je ne suis ni l'un ni l'autre.
Tu n'as plus besoin que
je prenne soin de toi,
alors j'essaie...
De te laisser un peu d'espace.
Comment fais-tu pour être
si intelligent,
et si paumé à la fois ?
Pourquoi je voudrais de l'espace ?
Où pourrais-je trouver
quelqu'un comme toi ?
Je suppose que ce serait
un sacré challenge.
J'aimerais...
que tu retournes voir ta petite-nièce.
Tu n'es plus en sécurité ici.
Je suis une cible, et tant que
tu resteras avec moi, tu le seras aussi.
Et quand tout ça sera fini,
quand j'aurai enfin mis au point
ce test,
je viendrai te chercher.
Comment savoir si tu le feras ?
Comment pourrais-je faire autrement ?
Où pourrais-je trouver
quelqu'un comme toi ?
Ne bouge plus, Tom.
Pose ton arme ou je tire.
Meghan, s'il te plaît.
Meghan, chérie, c'est moi.
Je t'en prie, tu dois m'aider.
Cette chose en moi,
j'essaie de la combattre,
Mais ça fait mal...
Tellement mal parfois.
À genoux, les mains derrière la tête.
Oh mon Dieu !
Tom, plus un geste !
Plus un geste, Tom !
- Voilà.
- Merci.
De rien.
Est-ce que tu as trouvé ton frère
amaigri ?
Fatigué ?
Je m'inquiète pour lui.
Maman, je ne suis pas venu ici
pour parler de Shawn.
Il y a quelque chose que
je voudrais te dire.
J'ai pris une dose.
Maman, ça a marché.
Je vais bien.
J'avais tellement peur que tu le fasses.
Dès que j'ai entendu parler de ce test,
- je savais que tu serais le premier.
- Maman, c'est une bonne chose.
Le monde est en train de changer.
Des miracles se produisent.
- Je vais faire partie de tout ça.
- Tout comme ton frère.
Ouais, je suppose.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'il aurait un don
et pas moi ?
Maman, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Maman, ça va pas ?
Maman !
À l'aide ! Je vous en prie !
Maman, non !
- Où est-il ?
- Je crois qu'il est allé derrière.
Ne bouge plus !
Lâche le flingue.
Ne m'oblige pas à te tirer dessus.
Tu comptes me guérir, Diana ?
Récupérer ton bon vieux Tom ?
Et tu crois que ça va arranger
les choses ?
Je suis meilleur agent maintenant
que je ne l'ai jamais été.
Depuis que...
- j'ai changé ma vision des choses...
- Les mains en l'air !
Garde-les là où je peux les voir.
J'ai fait plus de progrès
avec Jordan Collier et la promicine
que ce qu'on a pu faire en un an.
On est en train de gagner.
C'est pas ce que tu veux ?
Pas comme ça.
Tu as tué Curtis Peck,
tu as injecté l'inhibiteur à ma fille...
Ma fille, Tom.
Tu m'appelles encore par ce prénom.
Au fond de toi, tu sais qu'on est encore
partenaires, on veut la même chose.
Voilà ce que je vais faire, Diana.
Je vais me retourner,
franchir cette porte,
et tu ne pourras pas appuyer
sur la détente.
Nom de Dieu, Tom, arrête-toi !

4400 avaient disparu
4400 sont revenus
Tous possèdent une aptitude unique
L'un d'entre eux porte un message
Quiconque peut devenir exceptionnel
Le risque est immense
À la hauteur des bienfaits
C'est irréversible
Le monde devra nous accepter.
<i>Précédemment dans</i> Les 4400...
J'ai pris une dose.
Je vais bien.
Maman, ça va pas ?
À l'aide, je vous en prie !
Maman !
Isabelle est dans la Ville Promise.
<i>Dès qu'elle approchera de Collier,
elle agira.
<i>Qu'elle ne lui fasse pas de mal.
- J'ai cru que tu avais changé.
- Moi aussi.
Nous n'allons pas faire de vous
un martyr, Jordan.
Nous allons faire de vous un traître.
<i>Une fois marqué, vous allez détruire
le mouvement que vous avez créé.
Je sais pas ce qu'on vous apprend
sur le détournement de corps...
mais vous êtes
un piètre Tom Baldwin.
Si on veut tuer ce qu'il a en lui,
nous devrons tuer Tom aussi.
- Ne m'oblige pas à tirer.
- Tu comptes me guérir ?
- Récupérer ton bon vieux Tom ?
- Nom de Dieu, Tom, arrête !
Oh, mon Dieu, Tom ?
Il a sorti une arme.
J'étais obligée.
- Où est Shawn ?
- Dans la voiture.
On peut pas faire ça ici.
Il va pas bien.
Il faut l'emmener.
Oncle Tommy ?
Je dois le guérir maintenant.
Il perd trop de sang.
Pas encore.
Ce n'est pas Tom.
Il faut le débarrasser
de ce truc avant.
- Sortez tous.
- Voilà le polonium...
Il faut l'injecter directement
dans la colonne.
Je ne vais pas te mentir, Tom,
ça va faire mal.
Mais ça va tuer cette chose
qui est en toi.
On a perdu le pouls.
Maman ?
Elle est morte ?
Ma mère est morte ?
On ne sait pas encore.
Laissez-nous travailler.
Attendez à l'intérieur.
Vous avez fait
tout ce que vous pouviez.
Vous devez vous préparer
à de mauvaises nouvelles.
- Votre mère est un cas classique.
- Classique ?
- Mort à la promicine.
- Non...
Le mauvais côté du 50-50.
Ma mère n'a pas pris de dose !
Vous allez bien ?
Monsieur ?
Ça va ? À l'aide !
Attendez... Monsieur !
<i>Un secouriste à terre...
<i>Par ici...
Allez, oncle Tom.
Nom de Dieu !
J'y arrive pas.
C'est trop tard.
J'ai tué des gens.
J'ai tué des gens, Diana.
On en parlera plus tard.
Pour l'instant, repose-toi.
Je comprends pas.
Je lui parlais,
et il s'est écroulé.
Un peu comme
c'est arrivé avec ma mère.
M. Farrell...
J'ai besoin de renseignements.
Connaissez-vous la compagnie
d'assurance de votre mère ?
Non.
Madame ?
Oh, mon Dieu, Madame !
Quelqu'un... à l'aide !
Vous allez bien ?

Que s'est-il passé ?
Je me souviens à peine.
Et ce dont je me souviens,
ce sont des choses...
horribles.
Comment vais-je vivre
avec ce que j'ai fait ?
Comment être content
que cette chose soit partie.
On va déjà te surveiller
pour s'en assurer.
Tu va reprendre des forces,
et après,
tu nous diras qui sont les Marqués.
Tous.
Ensuite,
quoi que tu aies fait...
On s'en arrangera, OK ?
Personne n'entre ni ne sort
de St. Ambrose.
La police de Seattle
a isolé le bâtiment
et des équipes tactiques
sont en renfort.
Personne ne sait
ce qu'il s'est passé là-bas, mais...
J'ai pu appeler un docteur
qui est bloqué à l'intérieur,
il a vu des douzaines de morts.
Comment est-ce possible ?
Tous ces gens n'ont pas pris une dose.
Peut-être que quelqu'un
en injecte aux patients, comme...
un aide soignant,
ou un docteur.
Ça prendrait du temps
pour les traiter tous.
- Ça se répand beaucoup trop vite.
- Et si c'était un virus ?
Quelqu'un prend une dose...
et il développe la capacité
de répandre la promicine comme...
Je sais pas, la grippe.
- Mon Dieu...
- Si c'est le cas...
il faut s'attendre à avoir
beaucoup plus de victimes.
50-50.
Pour chaque mort à l'hôpital,
un autre a survécu, quelqu'un qui
développera une nouvelle capacité.
À votre avis, ils sont combien,
coincés dans cet hôpital ?
500 ?
1000 ?
Qu'importe le nombre,
on fera avec,
mais au moins,
on n'a pas rapporté de décès
en dehors de l'hôpital.
Votre frère Danny est dehors.
Dites-lui d'entrer.
Je ne peux pas.
Il est dans le jardin,
et il ne veut pas entrer.
C'est un peu bizarre,
franchement.
Il ne laisse personne
s'approcher de lui.
Que se passe-t-il ?
T'inquiètes tout le monde.
Tout le monde meurt, Shawn.
- Tout le monde meurt autour de moi.
- De quoi tu parles ?
À l'hôpital...
J'ai tué toutes ces personnes.
De quoi tu parles ?
Comment ça ?
C'est la dose.
Mon aptitude.
Je crois que j'infecte les gens
avec de la promicine.
Je sais pas quoi faire.
J'ai passé la nuit
caché dans le parc,
et je peux même pas me rendre
sans infecter encore plus de gens.
Bon, tu peux pas infecter quelqu'un
qui est déjà positif, non ?
Je ne crois pas.
Alors, tu vas rentrer.
Je vais faire évacuer le bâtiment.
Le Dr Burkhoff pourra probablement
se procurer de l'inhibiteur.
Entre.
On va te débarrasser de cette aptitude.
On va s'en sortir ensemble.
D'accord ?
Allez...
Maman est morte, Shawn.
Quoi ?
C'est arrivé hier soir.
C'était de ma faute.
Je l'ai tuée.
Je suis désolé, Shawn.
Je suis désolé.
Je ne voulais pas lui faire de mal.
Je ne voulais faire de mal à personne.
Je voulais vous dire quelque chose
tant que vous êtes encore vous-même.
Quand Kyle m'a amenée à vous,
je ne mentais pas.
Je voulais vraiment changer.
J'ai essayé,
mais je ne suis pas destinée à mener
une vie normale,
et j'ai été idiote de penser
le contraire.
Isabelle, tout le monde
a son destin entre ses mains.
Le choix n'a pas dû être facile,
mais tu as fini par te décider.
J'ai été créée pour accomplir
une mission.
Je ne voulais pas l'admettre,
mais...
maintenant je sais que
je dois faire ce qu'ils veulent.
Tue-moi.
Tue-moi tout de suite.
Ne les laisse pas se servir de moi
pour mettre fin au mouvement.
On t'a demandé
de ne pas parler à Collier.
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
ça n'arrivera plus.
Parce que je m'en vais.
Vous avez Collier.
J'ai fait
ce que vous m'aviez demandé.
Maintenant vous pouvez laisser partir
mon père.
Non.
Pas encore.
Votre père sera relâché
quand tout se sera déroulé
comme nous le souhaitions.
Ce n'est pas
ce dont nous avions convenu.
Je n'ai pas vraiment envie
d'en discuter.
J'apprécie d'avoir
retrouvé mes capacités
Je vais récupérer mon père moi-même.
Je ne pense pas, Isabelle.
Vous oubliez quelque chose.
Nous avons pris
une petite assurance sur vous
pendant que vous étiez en prison.
Vous vous souvenez de cet interrupteur
mortel dont Tom vous a parlé ?
C'est ce que vous sentez
en ce moment.
Si vous persistez à vouloir
nous désobéir,
je n'hésiterai pas à m'en servir...
pleinement.
<i>J'ai une déclaration au nom de tous
les habitants de la Ville Promise.
Nous n'avons rien à voir
avec les morts
de l'hôpital St Ambrose.
Forcer les gens à prendre
de la promicine va à l'encontre...
de tout ce que Jordan Collier défend.
Si Jordan était là,
il vous le dirait lui-même.
Mais, malheureusement,
il a disparu.
Il a été enlevé
par des ennemis du mouvement.
Nous le recherchons,
mais dans le même temps,
nous aimerions faire
un geste de bonne volonté
envers la ville de Seattle.
Les habitants de la Ville Promise...
sont déjà positifs à la promicine.
Nous ne sommes pas vulnérables
à ce qui passe à l'hôpital.
Nous souhaiterions offrir nos services
aux autorités.
<i>Nous ne nous rendrons pas dans la ville
sans invitation,
<i>mais, nous nous tenons prêts
à apporter notre aide.
<i>Le gouvernement n'a qu'un mot à dire.
Alors, prêt à donner le contrôle
de la ville à l'armée de Collier ?
- On pourrait avoir besoin d'eux.
- Je ne sais pas...
Je ne savais même pas que Collier
avait disparu jusqu'à maintenant.
Est-ce que Tom a pu
vous apprendre quelque chose ?
Dites-moi s'il commence à se souvenir.
Je vous appelle au moindre changement.
<i>Tout est redevenu calme
à St Ambrose
<i>et on vient juste de nous apprendre
que les autorités
<I>envisagent d'envoyer
une première équipe de secours.
Pas facile tous les jours, hein ?
- Comment ça va à l'hôpital ?
- C'est calme.
Quoi qu'il s'y soit passé,
c'est terminé.
Du moins, il n'y a plus de hurlements.
Les gars...
Regardez ça.
<i>Les autorités nous ont dit que...</i>
- C'est quoi ça ?
- Je suis pas sûre.
J'appelle immédiatement
nos agents sur place.
Ils nous ont dit que
l'épidémie était enrayée.
Écartez-vous d'elle !
Écartez-vous d'elle.
Il faut isoler cet endroit,
sur le champ !
C'est pas juste.
Je n'ai même pas pris de dose.
OK ! Allez, on y va.
On y va.
J'étais à un mètre de lui...
et j'ai survécu.
Ce n'est pas juste.
Que va-t-il nous arriver à présent ?
Enfin, ceux qui ont survécu...
Allons-nous tous développer
des capacités ?
Vous allez bien ?
Que se passe-t-il alors ?
On ramasse les morceaux.
Le pire est passé,
pour nous tout du moins.
Quelqu'un a dû sortir
de cet hôpital
et infecté tout le voisinage.
La maladie se répand partout
autour de St. Ambrose.
Et la police, les services d'urgence,
eux aussi ont dû rapporter le virus.
Ils ont été décimés.
Qui garde la ville alors ?
Pour le moment, personne.
L'armée a encerclé tout Seattle.
Le district entier
est en quarantaine.
Jusqu'où cela va-t-il
se répandre ?
On n'en sait rien.
Mais pour le moment,
concentrons-nous sur ce bâtiment.
On a testé tout le monde à la promicine.
- Les résultats sont revenus ?
- Oui...
Ils sont préliminaires, mais...
Il semble que les survivants
soient tous positifs.
Excepté une personne.
Toi.
Moi ?
Pourquoi ?
Ce n'est qu'une supposition,
mais...
l'an dernier, Burkhoff t'a injecté
une version préliminaire de promicine.
Tu n'as pas eu de capacité, mais...
il semble que ton corps
se soit immunisé contre la promicine.
Je ne risque pas d'infecter
qui que ce soit ?
Non. Enfin, je crois pas.
Comment te sens-tu ?
Fatigué.
Que m'avez-vous donné ?
Un mélange de sédatif
et d'inhibiteur.
On ne saura pas si ta capacité
a disparu avant...
quelques heures.
Je ne veux pas dormir.
Je veux aider.
Tu ne peux rien faire
pour le moment.
Ferme les yeux, mon pote.
As-tu réfléchi
à ce que tu allais faire ?
Je vais livrer Danny au NTAC.
Je crois que c'est mieux.
Je le crois aussi.
Il faut qu'ils étudient ton frère.
Il est peut-être le seul moyen
de trouver un antidote.
Une fois aux mains du gouvernement,
qui sait s'ils le relâcheront un jour.
Je ne veux pas perdre mon frère
et ma mère le même jour.
Mon Dieu, ma mère est morte...
Le virus a infecté la mairie.
Le maire, la moitié du conseil,
de la police,
et des auxiliaires médicaux sont morts.
Les gens désertent en masse.
Il faut accepter
l'offre de Kyle Baldwin,
voir si ces positifs
peuvent restaurer l'ordre.
Es-tu prête à franchir ce pas ?
On n'a pas le choix.
Le gouvernement ne fait
qu'isoler la ville.
En gros, ils enterrent Seattle.
Il faut faire quelque chose.
Je vais à la Ville Promise.
Tu ne peux pas te balader comme ça.
Laisse-moi y aller.
Je suis censée pouvoir
résister à cette chose.
C'est pourquoi tu vas
au Centre 4400.
Tu pourrais être notre salut.
S'ils trouvent ce qui te rend
invulnérable,
ils pourront reproduire
l'effet et créer un vaccin.
OK, ça ne se fera pas,
car les labos du NTAC
sont fermés.
Shawn Farrell n'élabore pas
son test de compatibilité tout seul.
Quelqu'un mène les recherches,
un vrai scientifique.
Quelqu'un comme Kevin Burkhoff.
Ma soeur est morte.
C'était Shawn.
Susan était dans cet hôpital.
Oh, mon Dieu, Tom.
Je suis désolée.
Tu devrais t'allonger.
Je ne peux qu'imaginer
ce que tu ressens.
Non, je pleurerai plus tard.
Où avez-vous mis mon arme ?
Je me souviens de tout,
maintenant.
Je sais où les Marqués
gardent Jordan Collier.
OK, dis-nous où
et j'y enverrai une équipe.
Je dois y aller. Isabelle y est
et a recouvré ses capacités.
Ils me croient de leur côté.
J'entre, récupère Collier,
et je trouve ce qu'ils ont en tête.
Laissez-moi faire.
Il le faut.
On m'a autorisée à accepter
votre offre.
Que voulez-vous faire ?
Nous devons sécuriser
les rues à nouveau.
Je souhaite utiliser vos hommes
comme force de sécurité temporaire.
La première chose à faire
est d'écrire une liste
de toutes les capacités disponibles.
Ensuite, nous en déduirons
où les déployer.
Il n'y a pas de plan à faire.
Jordan en a déjà un en place.
Je connais exactement
quelles sont nos forces,
et je sais où les envoyer
pour prendre le contrôle de la ville.
Ravie de vous savoir prêts
à prendre le contrôle de Seattle,
mais une fois ceci terminé,
vous me rendez ma ville.
Le monde entier est terrifié
par les événements ici.
C'est une vraie opportunité.
Une fois terminé,
on utilise notre influence,
partout dans le monde,
pour initier une guerre totale
contre les positifs.
Cette fois, ce ne sera pas vain.
Oui.
Parfait.
Marrant comment les choses tournent.
Vous avez Collier,
mais vous perdez Seattle.
Tu as tort.
Je ne vais pas rester là
à regarder une milice
de positifs prendre
les commandes de la cette ville.
Nous pensions que le mouvement
s'écroulerait sans Collier.
Mais ça n'est pas arrivé.
Quelqu'un l'a remplacé.
- Vous parlez de Kyle ?
- Tout à fait.
Il faut l'arrêter.
Tu dois l'arrêter.
Tu vas retourner
dans la Ville Promise...
et tu vas tuer Kyle Baldwin.
Kyle est ton seul vrai lien
avec ton passé, cette idée de toi
à laquelle tu t'accrochais tant.
Une fois Kyle mort,
tu oublieras ce passé.
Vous voulez sa mort.
Je suis votre arme.
J'ai compris.
Vous étiez injoignable
depuis un moment.
- Où étiez-vous ?
- J'assurais mes arrières.
Skouris raconte que je suis marqué.
La croit-on ?
Pas ma patronne.
Meghan Doyle tient à Tom Baldwin.
Je l'ai convaincue.
De toute façon, ils sont débordés.
Le virus a infiltré le NTAC.
Ça a tué la soeur de Baldwin.
J'ai dû verser quelques larmes
pour sauver les apparences.
Le virus est devenu incontrôlable.
La moitié du NTAC développe
des capacités.
Comment réagir ?
On a marqué Collier.
Nous attendons qu'il se transforme.
En attendant, j'ai envoyé
Isabelle à la Ville Promise
s'occuper du nouveau leader
du mouvement,
Kyle Baldwin.
Bien.
Ton corps produit
une quantité anormale
d'une enzyme appelée
"ubiquinone".
C'est un composé qui muscle
le système immunitaire,
et une surproduction t'a rendue
résistante à la promicine.
Si on reproduit cet effet,
peut-on fabriquer un vaccin ?
Des gens meurent.
Nous n'avons pas le temps
de produire et distribuer
une enzyme en masse.
Pas besoin de produire en masse
quoi que ce soit.
L'ubiquinone est déjà utilisée
comme complément alimentaire.
Elle est vendue en pilule
dans les pharmacies.
Si on en prend assez,
peut-on rapidement s'immuniser ?
Votre frère n'a pas l'air d'aller bien.
Il faut faire une annonce
pour ces pilules.
Allez-y.
Je vais passer des coups de fil.
L'inhibiteur fait effet.
Tu n'es plus contagieux,
mais ton corps produit toujours
de la promicine, et...
comme il ne peut plus la disperser
dans l'air via ta capacité,
elle est stockée dans ton corps.
Ça m'étouffe.
C'est bon, Danny,
on va trouver une solution.
Que peut-on faire pour l'aider ?
On pourrait arrêter l'inhibiteur.
Physiquement, il irait bien.
Mais je redeviendrais contagieux.
- Exactement.
- Pas question.
- Hors de question.
- Danny !
Non, Shawn.
Qu'arrive-t-il
si je reste sous inhibiteur ?
Je mourrais ?
Je vais vous faire sortir de là.
Cette chose en vous,
on peut vous en débarrasser.
Comment ?
Vous vous en soucierez
une fois dehors.
Quoiqu'il m'arrive,
ne vous arrêtez
qu'une fois la porte franchie.
Ma voiture est garée devant.
S'il m'arrive quelque chose,
appelez Kyle tout de suite.
Parrish a envoyé Isabelle
s'occuper de lui.
Si vous êtes à nouveau
agent du NTAC,
que se passera-t-il
quand on sera sortis de là ?
Est-ce que je vais vous arrêter ?
J'adorerais,
mais c'est pas le plan.
Même si j'ai du mal à l'admettre,
cette ville a besoin de vous.
Vous êtes prêt ?
Vous avez tressailli quand j'ai dit
qu'Isabelle s'occupait de votre fils.
Personne n'avait jamais réussi
à se débarrasser d'une marque avant ça.
Il va falloir me dire
comment vous avez fait ça.
Plus tard.
Nos équipes sont en place.
Ravenna est déjà sous contrôle.
Beacon Hill's aussi.
Bien,
envoyons quelques hommes à Northgate,
pour arrêter les pillages.
On pourra pas distribuer
l'Ubiquinone avant que la ville
n'ait retrouvé son calme.
Salut, Kyle.
Ferme les yeux.
Non.
Si tu veux faire ce que je pense,
tu devras me regarder dans les yeux.
Tu n'as pas pu me tuer.
Tu es humaine.
Il y a tant de choses dans ce monde
que je n'ai pas vues.
Tant de choses magnifiques.
Tu as le temps.
Tu pourras voir
tout ce que tu veux.
Nous le pourrons.
Tu es adorable, Kyle.
Au revoir.
Ces pilules sont le moyen d'éviter
que plus de gens ne meurent.
Je suis fier de dire que le Centre
collabore avec le gouvernement
et les habitants de la Ville Promise
pour distribuer ce médicament
à toute la région de Seattle.
Si vous n'êtes pas déjà infectés,
ces médicaments vous sauveront la vie
ou vous empêcheront
de développer une capacité.
Le gouvernement collabore avec
des organismes de secours
afin que de l'Ubiquinone
soit acheminée par avion vers Seattle.
Il y en aura assez pour tous.
Les gens se demandent
ce à quoi Seattle ressemblera
quand tout sera terminé,
combien de personnes...
auront péri,
comment une ville peut fonctionner
avec ces aptitudes non désirées.
En vérité,
nous n'avons pas de réponse,
mais... cette ville a déjà traversé
beaucoup d'épreuves,
et elle survivra à celle-ci.
Merci à tous d'être venus.
Vous avez pris de grands risques,
et n'oubliez pas
de prendre vos pilules.
Shawn... Merci.
Tout ça ne servira à rien
si l'Ubiquinone n'arrive pas très vite.
On y travaille.
Je coordonne la distribution
entre le CDC, la FEMA
et la Croix-Rouge.
Je sais que tu as beaucoup à faire,
mais tu nous as aidés,
et tu étais la bonne personne
pour t'adresser au public.
Oui, je suis là.
Ça fait vraiment mal ?
J'ai mal en respirant.
Je vais arranger ça,
- tu te sentiras mieux un moment.
- Non...
Fais pas ça.
Tu l'as déjà fait il y a une heure.
Regarde-moi.
On va arrêter
de te donner l'inhibiteur,
et te mettre en isolation...
- C'est trop dangereux.
- Non.
On a les pilules, maintenant.
Et si elles n'avaient pas
d'effet sur moi ?
Et si mon aptitude se renforçait
d'ici une semaine ?
Tout ça pourrait recommencer.
Trop de personnes sont mortes
par ma faute, Shawn.
Ce n'est pas de ta faute.
Je sais, mais je dois vivre avec.
Je ne m'en sortirai pas, Shawn.
Je le sais.
Tu ne mourras pas, Danny.
- Je te laisserai pas mourir.
- Ça ira.
Tu dois faire quelque chose
pour m'aider.
Arrête la douleur.
Qu'elle s'en aille pour de bon, OK ?
Danny, non, hors de question.
Hors de question.
T'es mon petit frère.
Alors je t'en prie, mon frère.
- Ne dis pas ça.
- S'il te plaît, Shawn.
Fais de moi la dernière victime.
Fais-le.
S'il te plaît.
S'il te plaît, Shawn, je t'en prie.
S'il te plaît, Shawn, fais-le.
Je t'aime.
Je t'en prie !
Je n'arrive pas à respirer.
Tu as fait ton choix.
Tu étais notre seul espoir
pour sauver le futur.
Votre futur n'existe plus.
Vous êtes libres.
Rendez ce monde
meilleur qu'il ne l'est.
Vous comprenez ce qu'il faut faire pour
vous débarrasser de cette chose ?
Il va falloir recoller les morceaux
avec Shawn.
Je suis prêt à ça,
j'espère que lui aussi.
Encore une chose...
Il y a sept noms là-dessus.
Le reste des Marqués.
Ils auront besoin du même traitement
que vous.
Ce sont des gens très puissants.
Le NTAC ne peut pas s'en charger.
On ne pourra jamais les atteindre
par les moyens officiels.
Je me demande,
quand nous serons de retour en ville,
qui sera responsable,
mon côté ou le vôtre ?
Je pense que bientôt...
cette distinction
n'aura plus de sens.
Prenez soin de vous, Tom.
<i>Huit Jours Plus Tard
Nous sommes réunis aujourd'hui
pour célébrer la mémoire
de Susan et Danny Farrell,
une mère merveilleuse
et son fils bien-aimé.
Nous les regretterons,
comme tant d'autres.
La ville entière est en deuil
aujourd'hui.
Nous nous posons tous
la même question...
Serons-nous capables de surmonter
toutes ces pertes, tout ce chagrin ?
Mais c'est dans cette question,
que réside notre réponse,
notre salut.
C'est parce que nous partageons
ces pertes et ce chagrin,
qu'ensemble,
grâce à votre solidarité,
à votre compréhension,
et à votre amour,
nous pourrons surmonter
cette tragédie.
Shawn, je suis désolé.
Je suis désolée mec.
Merci.
- Salut, Papa.
- Salut.
Jordan m'a tout dit.
Tu vas bien ?
Ouais, je m'en sortirai...
Isabelle comptait pour toi,
je suis désolé qu'elle ne soit plus là.
Je sais ce que tu ressens, Shawn.
Tu penses qu'il n'y a plus personne,
que tu es seul au monde.
Mais c'est faux.
Je suis là.
Tout comme Kyle.
On s'en sortira tous ensemble.
Comme une vraie famille, OK ?
Je viens de recevoir
une nouvelle estimation.
On sait que la ville
a perdu 9000 de ses habitants.
Ce ne sont que les décès confirmés.
Ce n'est pas définitif.
Alors, ça nous fait
au moins 9000 nouvelles aptitudes.
Beaucoup appartiendront
à des personnes que nous connaissons.
NTAC, Police, SAMU.
Nous avons été
les premiers exposés.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire,
s'arrêter ?
Personne n'arrête personne.
Tous les organismes de la ville
fonctionnent à effectif réduit,
et pas d'aide
avant la fin de la quarantaine.
Donc d'ici une semaine,
peut-être plus.
Alors, il n'y a que nous.
La plus haute figure d'autorité
à Seattle
pour le moment,
c'est Jordan Collier.
Ses hommes sont les plus efficaces
qu'on ait à notre disposition.
Et quand la quarantaine sera levée,
que se passera-t-il ?
Les hommes de Collier se retireront ?
Ils nous rendront la ville ?
C'est ce que tu ferais ?
<i>Peut-on stopper Jordan Collier ?
L'heure est venue...
pour cette ville
de commencer sa reconstruction.
Je n'ai jamais souhaité...
que la promicine se propage
de cette manière,
mais les sacrifices
de ces derniers jours,
n'ont pas été vains !
Cette tragédie,
aussi terrible soit-elle,
a un sens,
et ceux qui ont péri...
sont annonciateurs
d'une nouvelle ère !
Des milliers d'entre vous
ont de nouvelles capacités,
et avec le temps,
vous contribuerez tous à ce mouvement.
Un mouvement...
qui aujourd'hui,
revendique Seattle comme son foyer.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Jed Garrity.
Vous êtes qui, vous ?
Nous avons soutenu cette ville...
quand elle en a eu besoin,
et nous allons maintenant la guider
vers le futur.
<i>Nous sommes tous miraculés,</i>
<i>chacun d'entre nous.</i>
<i>Ensemble, nous accomplirons
de merveilleuses choses.</i>
Tu vois ?
Je t'avais dit que c'était un gentil.
Maia, tu ne vois pas ce qu'il se passe ?
Jordan Collier se proclame lui-même
dictateur de Seattle.
Il n'y a rien de bon dans tout ça.
Tu as tort, Maman.
Nous avons le pouvoir,
maintenant.
C'est mieux comme ça.
Je vous ai déjà parlé...
du Paradis sur Terre.
Beaucoup d'entre vous
pensaient cela impossible,
mais aujourd'hui,
j'ai la conviction...
que nous le verrons de notre vivant !
Il y a un moyen de vivre avec ça.
Tu as tué des gens.
Même si ça n'était pas vraiment toi,
tu te sens responsable.
Crois-moi, je suis passé par là.
Deux personnes sont mortes. Ça n'était
pas Collier. Elles ne reviendront pas.
Mais toi, tu es encore là.
Tu dois trouver
une raison de vivre.
Comment ?
Papa, il est temps.

The world
will have to deal with us.
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...
I took the shot.
I'm fine.
Mom, what's wrong?
Someone help, please!
Mom!
Isabelle's in Promise City.
<i>As soon as she gets close
to Collier, she'll move.
<i>She knows
not to damage him, right?
For a while there,
I believed you'd changed.
- So did I.
- <i>We're not gonna make you
a martyr to your cause, Jordan,
we're going to make you
a traitor to it.
<i>Once you're marked,
you'll single-handedly
<i>destroy the movement
you created.
I don't know what lessons you
took in bodysnatching school, but...
you make
a terrible Tom Baldwin.
If we really want to kill
that thing inside him,
we're gonna have
to kill Tom, too.
- Don't make me shoot you.
- You going to fix me, Diana?
- Going to get your old Tom back?
- Goddamn it, Tom, stop!
Oh, my god, Tom?
He pulled a gun.
I had to fire.
- Where's Shawn?
- He's waiting in the car. I'll get him.
We can't do it here.
He's in bad shape.
We have to move him.
Uncle Tommy?
I need to heal him now.
He's losing blood too fast.
Not yet.
That's not Tom.
We need to get rid of that thing
inside of him first.
- Everybody out.
- Here's the polonium...
We need to inject it
directly into his spine.
I can't lie to you, Tom,
this is going to hurt.
But it's going to kill
that thing inside you.
We lost pulse.
Mom?
Is she dead?
Is my mom dead?
We don't know yet.
Sir, you need to let us work.
You can wait inside.
You did everything
you could.
I think you need to prepare yourself
for some bad news.
- Your mom's a textbook case.
- A textbook case of what?
- Promicin death.
- No...
She landed
on the wrong side of 50-50.
My mom didn't take the shot!
Are you okay?
Sir?
Are you okay? Help!
Wait... Sir!
Come on, uncle Tom.
Dammit!
I can't.
It's too late.
I think I killed people.
I think I killed people, Diana.
We can talk about that later.
Right now,
you need to rest.
Don't know what happened.
I was talking to the guy
and he collapsed.
Kind of like what
happened with my mom.
Mr. Farrell...
I need some information.
Do you know who your mother's
insurance carrier is?
No.
Ma'am?
Oh, my god, ma'am!
Somebody!
Are you okay?

What happened?
I can barely
remember anything.
And the few things I do,
they're all...
They're all bad.
How am I supposed to live
with what I did?
How can I even be positive
that thing is gone?
Well, we're going to
watch over you until we're sure.
You're going to
recover yourself,
and when you do,
you'll tell us who the Marked are.
All of them.
And after that,
whatever you did...
We'll deal with it, okay?
Nobody's getting into
or out of St. Ambrose.
Seattle police have it
under strict quarantine
and we have tactical agents
reinforcing them.
No one knows exactly
what happened in there yet, but...
I did manage to get on the phone
with a doctor who's trapped inside,
and he has personally seen
dozens of deaths.
How is that possible? There's no way
all those people took the shot.
Maybe someone's going around
injecting patients, like...
an orderly or a doctor.
No, it'd take time to force the shot
on all those people.
- This is spreading way too fast.
- What if it's a virus?
You know,
someone took the shot,
and the ability they developed
is to spread promicin like...
I don't know, the flu.
- God...
- Well, if that's true,
we have more than just a bunch
of victims on our hands.
50-50. For everyone who died
in that hospital,
someone else survived, Someone
who'll develop a brand new ability.
How many people do you think
are trapped inside that hospital?
500?
1000?
Whatever the number,
we'll deal with it,
but at least there haven't been
any reports of deaths
outside the hospital.
Your brother danny's outside.
Tell him to come in.
I can't.
He's out in the gardens,
and he won't come inside.
It's a little strange,
to be honest.
He's not letting anybody
near him.
What's going on?
You're making everybody nervous.
Everyone's dying, Shawn.
- Everyone around me is dying.
- What are you talking about?
That hospital?
I killed all those people.
Danny, what do you mean?
How? What?
It's the shot.
My ability.
I think I'm infecting people
with promicin.
And I don't know
what to do.
I've been hiding out
all night in a park,
and I can't even turn myself in
without making more people sick.
Okay, you can't infect anyone
who's already promicin positive, right?
I don't think so.
So you're going to come inside.
I'm going to clear everyone else
out of the building.
Dr. Burkhoff can probably get his hands
on some of the inhibitor.
Come inside.
We're going to suppress your ability.
We'll figure this out together.
Okay?
Come on...
Mom's dead, Shawn.
What?
It happened last night.
It was my fault.
I killed her.
I'm sorry, Shawn.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt her.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
I wanted you to hear something
while you're still you.
When Kyle brought me to you,
I wasn't lying.
I really did want to change.
I tried,
but I'm not meant to lead
a normal life,
and it was stupid
to think I could.
Isabelle, everyone is in charge
of their own destiny.
You may not have liked
the choices you had.
Still, you made one.
I was created to do a job.
I fought it for a while, but...
now I know
I have to do what they want.
Kill me.
Kill me right now.
Don't let them use me
to end this movement.
You were told
not to speak to Collier.
Don't worry.
It won't happen again.
Because I'm ready
to get out of here.
You've got collier.
I did what you asked me to do.
Now you can let
my father go.
No.
Not yet.
Your father will be released
when everything's arranged
exactly as we want it.
That is not what we agreed to.
I don't really feel
like arguing about it.
I like having
my abilities back.
I'll go get
my father myself.
I don't think so, Isabelle.
I think you're forgetting.
We took out a little
insurance policy on you
while you were in prison.
You remember that kill switch
that Tom told you about?
You're feeling it right now.
If you insist on disobeying us,
I won't hesitate to use it...
Fully.
<i>I wanna make a statement on behalf
of everyone who lives in Promise City.
We had nothing to do
with the deaths
at St. Ambrose hospital.
Forcing people to take promicin
goes against everything...
Jordan Collier stands for.
If Jordan were here,
he would tell you himself.
But, unfortunately,
he is missing.
He was abducted
by enemies of the movement.
We are working to find him,
but while we do,
we'd like to extend
a gesture of goodwill
to the city of Seattle.
The residents of Promise City...
are already promicin positive.
We're not vulnerable
to what's happening in the hospital.
We'd like to offer our services
to the authorities.
<i>We will not move out into the city
without an invitation,
<i>but we do stand ready
to help.
<i>All the government
has to do is ask.
So, ready to hand over
control of the city to Collier's army?
We might need them
before this is over.
I'm not sure, Meghan.
I didn't even know Collier was missing
until just now.
Has Tom been able
to tell you anything?
Let me know if he starts to remember.
I'll call you if anything changes here.
<i>Everything's gone silent
within St. Ambrose
<i>and we just had word
that authorities
<I>are considering sending in
the first relief team.
How would you like to have
that job, huh?
- How are things at the hospital?
- It's quiet.
Whatever happened in there,
I think it's over.
At least, the screaming has stopped.
Guys...
Look at this.
<i>Authorities tell us that...
- What just happened there?
- I'm not sure.
We need to talk
to the agents on site, right now.
They told us
it was contained.
Everybody,
get away from her!
Get away from her.
We need to
seal this place off, now!
It's not fair.
I didn't even take the shot.
Ok! Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
I was five feet from him...
and I lived.
It doesn't seem right.
What's going to
happen to us now?
I mean, everyone
who survived...
are we going to
develop abilities?
You two okay?
What's going on out there?
We're picking up the pieces.
The worst is over,
for us, anyway.
Someone must have gotten out
of that hospital
and infected everyone
on the perimeter.
The sickness is spreading
through the neighborhood
near St. Ambrose.
And the police,
emergency services,
their people must have
brought the virus back
from the barricade, too.
They've been devastated.
So who's watching over the city?
Right now, no one.
The army has Seattle surrounded.
The entire district
is under quarantine.
How far is this thing
going to spread?
We don't know.
But right now,
I want to keep focused on this building.
Marco, we gave everyone promicin tests.
- Have the results come in yet?
- Yeah, um...
They're preliminary, but...
It looks like everyone
who survived is positive.
Except for one person.
You.
Me?
Why?
It's just a guess, but...
you know, last year, Dr. Burkhoff forced
an early version of promicin on you.
You didn't get an ability, but...
it looks like your body developed
a resistance to promicin exposure.
There's no chance
that I could infect anybody?
No.
I mean, I don't think so.
How do you feel?
Tired.
What did you give me?
I included a sedative in the sample of
the inhibitor I mixed up.
We won't know
if your ability's suppressed for...
a few hours.
I don't want to sleep.
I want to help.
There's nothing
you can do right now.
Just close your eyes, buddy.
Have you given any thought
to what you want to do?
I'm gonna give Danny to NTAC.
I think I have to.
I think so, too.
They have to study your brother.
He may be the only way
to find an antidote.
Once the government has him,
who knows
if they'll ever let him go.
I don't want to lose my brother
and my mom on the same day.
Jesus, my mom is gone...
The virus got into city hall.
The mayor's down,
half the city council,
police, paramedics.
People are abandoning
their posts in droves.
I think we need to take
Kyle Baldwin up on his offer,
see if his positives
can't restore some order.
Are you ready
to cross that line?
We don't have a choice.
The federal government
is focused on containment.
They're basically
writing Seattle off.
We can't let that happen.
I'm going to Promise City.
Well, you can't just
drive across town. Let me go.
I'm the one who's supposed to be
resistant to this thing.
That's why you're going
to the 4400 center.
You could be the key
to ending this.
If someone could figure out
why you're not vulnerable,
maybe they could replicate the effect
and create a vaccine.
Okay, well,
we're not doing it,
Because NTAC medical's
shut down.
Shawn farrell is not developing
that compatibility test on his own.
Someone is doing the research,
someone with a scientific background.
Someone like Kevin Burkhoff.
My sister's dead.
That was shawn.
Susan was in that hospital. She's dead.
Oh, my god, Tom.
I'm so sorry.
You should lie down.
I can't imagine
what you're feeling now.
No, no, I'll mourn later.
Where'd you put my gun?
I remember it all now.
Everything.
The marked have Jordan Collier.
I know where they're keeping him.
OK, tell us where he is,
and I'll put together a task force.
It has to be me. Isabelle's there.
She has her abilities back.
They think I'm one of them.
I'll walk in, I'll get Collier,
I can find out what they're planning
next. Let me do this, please.
I have to.
I've been authorized to accept
your offer of assistance.
What did you have in mind?
We need to restore order
to the streets.
I would like to use your people
as a temporary security force.
The first thing we need to do
is write a list of all the abilities
at your disposal.
Then we can figure out
how to deploy them.
Look, there's no reason to make a plan.
Jordan already has one in place.
I know exactly what we have
at our disposal,
and I know where to send them
to take control of the city.
I'm glad you're so prepared
to take over Seattle,
but when this is over,
I want my city back.
The whole world is terrified
of what's happening here.
That's an opportunity.
Once this is over,
we use all our influence,
here and abroad,
and push for all-out
war against the positives.
This time, we will be heard.
Yes.
Great.
Funny how things happen.
You've got Collier,
but you're losing Seattle.
You're wrong.
I'm not going to stand by
and watch a militia
of positives
take command of this city.
We thought the movement would
fall apart. Once we had Collier,
but that didn't happen.
Someone stepped in and took his place.
- You're talking about Kyle?
- That's right.
He has to be stopped.
You have to stop him.
You're going back
into Promise City
and you're going
to kill Kyle Baldwin.
Kyle's your only real connection
to your past, this idea of yourself
that you've been hanging onto.
Once he's gone, you'll let it go.
You want him dead.
I'm your weapon.
I get it.
You've been out of contact
for a long time.
- Where have you been?
- I was doing damage control.
Skouris has been telling people
I'm marked.
Do they believe her?
My boss doesn't.
Meghan Doyle cares about Tom Baldwin.
I brought her around.
Anyway, their hands are full.
The virus got into NTAC.
It killed Baldwin's sister, too.
I had to shed a few tears
just for appearance's sake.
This thing has gotten out of control.
Half of NTAC is developing
new abilities.
How are we responding?
Collier's been marked.
We're waiting for him to turn.
In the meantime,
I sent Isabelle to Promise City,
to deal with the new
leader of the movement,
Kyle Baldwin.
Good.
Your body produces
abnormal amounts
of an enzyme
called Ubiquinone.
It's a compound that
boosts the immune system,
and overproduction of it
made you resistant to promicin.
If we replicate that effect,
can we make a vaccine?
People are dying right now.
We don't have time
to mass-produce some enzyme
and get it to people.
We don't have to
mass-produce anything.
Ubiquinone is already
available as a supplement.
They sell it in pills in health
food stores, pharmacies.
If you take enough of them,
can you develop a resistance quickly?
I just checked in on your brother.
He doesn't look good.
We have to get word
out about these pills.
You go.
I'll start making phone calls.
The inhibitor is working.
You're no longer contagious,
but your body is still
producing promicin, and...
since it can no longer disperse it
into the air via your ability,
it's building up in your system.
I'm choking on the stuff.
It's all right, Danny,
we're going to figure it out.
So, what can we do to help him?
We could take him off the inhibitor.
Physically, he'd be fine.
But I'd be contagious again.
- Exactly.
- No way.
- That's not an option.
- Danny!
No, Shawn.
What happens
if I stay on the inhibitor?
You saying I'll die?
I'm getting you out of here.
That thing inside you.
There's a way to get rid of it.
How?
You can worry about that
once you're out of here.
No matter what happens to me,
don't stop
until you're through the front door.
My car's right outside.
If anything happens to me,
you need to call Kyle right away.
Parrish sent Isabelle after him.
If you're an NTAC agent again,
what happens once we're outta here?
You mean, am I going to arrest you?
I'd love to,
but that's not the plan.
As much as it hurts me to admit it,
this city needs you right now.
Are you ready?
You flinched when I told you
Isabelle was going after your son.
No one's ever managed
to get rid of a mark before.
You're going to have
to tell me how you did it.
Later.
All our teams are in place.
We already have Ravenna under control.
Beacon Hill's quiet, too.
Good, let's move some of
your people into Northgate.
See if we can stop the looting.
We can't start distributing
these Ubiquinone supplements
until the city is calm.
Hi, Kyle.
Close your eyes.
No.
If you're going to do
what I think you are,
you have to look me in the eye.
You couldn't kill me.
You're human.
There's so much of
the world that I never saw.
So much that's beautiful.
You have time.
You can see whatever you want.
We can.
You have a good heart, Kyle.
Goodbye.
These pills are the way that
we can stop anyone else from dying.
I'm proud to say
that the 4400 center
is working in conjunction
with the government
and residents of Promise City
to distribute this
over-the-counter product
to every neighborhood in Seattle.
If you haven't already been infected,
these will either save your life,
or they will keep you
from getting an ability.
The goverment is also working
with relief agencies
to air-lift supplies
of Ubiquinone into the city,
so there'll be enough for everyone.
People are wondering what
seattle is going to look like
when this is all over,
how many people...
will have lost their lives,
how a city with so many unwanted
new abilities Is going to function.
The truth is,
we don't have any answers,
but this city has survived a lot,
and it will survive this.
Thank you all for coming.
You risked a lot to get this message out
and do not forget
to take your pills.
Shawn... Thank you.
None of this is going to mean anything
unless that air-lift happens right away.
We're working on it.
I'm coordinating distribution
between the CDC, FEMA
and the Red Cross.
Look, I know that you're
dealing with a lot,
but you helped keep this contained,
and you were the right face
to put in front of the public.
Yeah, buddy, I'm right here.
It really hurts.
It hurts to breathe.
I'm going to fix that.
- Make you feel better for a little bit.
- No...
Don't.
You did that an hour ago.
Look at me.
Danny...
we're going to take
you off the inhibitor,
and we're going to put you
in isolation...
- It's too dangerous.
- Not anymore.
We know about those pills now.
What if they don't work around me?
Or what if in a week from now,
my ability gets stronger?
The whole thing could start again.
Too many people are
dead because of me, Shawn.
It's not your fault.
I know, but I have to live with it.
I'm not going to make
it through this, Shawn.
I know it.
You're not going to die, Danny.
- I'm not going to let you.
- It's okay.
But I need you
to do something for me.
Just make it stop hurting.
Just make the pain go away
for good, okay?
Oh, Danny, no,
I'm not going to do that.
I'm not going to do that.
You're my little brother.
Then I'm begging you, brother.
- Don't.
- Please, Shawn.
Let me be the last victim.
Please do it.
Please...
Please, Shawn, I beg you.
Please, shawn, do it.
I love you.
Please! I can't breathe.
You made your choice.
You were our only hope
for the future!
Your future's dead now.
You're free now.
Make this world
better than it is.
You understand what you have to do
to get rid of that thing inside you?
You'll have to mend fences
with Shawn.
Well, I'm more than willing.
I hope he will be, too.
Jordan...
there's one more thing.
There's seven names there.
The rest of the marked.
They're going to need
the same treatment you get.
These are powerful people.
That's why NTAC can't handle it.
We'd never be able to get
them through official channels.
I can't help but wonder
when we walk back into the city,
who's going to be in charge,
my side or yours?
I think, soon...
that distinction
won't mean a thing.
Be well, Tom.
We are gathered here
today to pay our respects
to Susan and Danny Farrell,
a wonderful mother
and a loving son.
They will be missed,
as will so many others.
The entire city is
grief-stricken today.
We're all asking ourselves
the same question...
Are we going to deal with
all this lost, all this pain?
But I believe that in that question,
relies our answer to salvation.
Because it is a shared lost,
it is a shared pain,
that only together,
with your sympathy,
with your understanding,
with your love,
we could realize all this tragedy.
Shawn, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, man.
Thank you.
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.
Jordan told me everything
that happened.
You okay?
Yeah, I'll get there...
And I know you cared about Isabelle.
I'm sorry she's gone.
I know how you're feeling
right now, Shawn.
You're thinking that everyone's gone,
that you're alone.
But you're not.
I'm here.
So's Kyle,
And we're going to help
each other get through this.
We're going to figure out
how to be a family, okay?
I just got a revised
estimate of the tally so far.
We know the city's
lost 9,000 people.
That's just confirmed dead.
It's not a final count.
So we're looking at 9,000
new abilities at the very least.
A lot of those abilities are gonna
belong to people we know.
NTAC, police, paramedics.
I mean, we were the first
ones exposed to this thing.
What are we gonna do,
arrest ourselves?
No one's arresting anybody right now.
Every city agency's
operating on a skeleton crew,
and we won't have federal
help until they lift the quarantine.
That'll be a week, maybe more.
So we're still on our own.
The loudest voice
of authority in Seattle
right now is Jordan Collier's.
Well, his p-positives are the most
effective law and order we've got.
And when quarantine's lifted,
what happens?
Are Collier's people gonna stand down?
Will they give the city back to us?
Would you?
The time has come...
for this city to begin healing.
I never intended...
promicin to spread this way,
but the sacrifices
of the past few days
have not been in vain!
This tragedy,
terrible as it may have been,
had meaning,
and those who died...
are the heralds of a new age!
Thousands upon thousands
of you have new abilities,
and in time, you will all
contribute to this movement,
a movement...
that now claims all Seattle
as its home!
Who are you?
I'm Jed Garrity.
Who the hell are you?
We stood by the city...
in its hour of need,
and we will now guide
this city into the future.
<i>We're all miracles.</i>
<i>Every one of us,</i>
<i>and together,</i>
<i>we will do wondrous things.</i>
See?
I told you he was a good guy.
Maia, can't you see
what's happening?
Jordan Collier is naming himself
dictator of Seattle.
There's nothing good about that.
You're wrong, mom.
We're in charge now.
It's better that way.
I've spoken to the world before...
of heaven on Earth.
Many of you thought it impossible,
But now,
I'm convinced...
we will see it in our lifetimes!
There's a way to live with it.
You killed people.
Even though it wasn't really you,
you still feel responsible.
Believe me, I have been there.
2 people are dead. They're not Collier.
They're not coming back.
But you're still here.
You have to figure out
how to move on.
How?
Dad, it's time.
