OZ, THE NAME
ON THE STREET
FOR THE OSWALD MAXIMUM
SECURITY PENITENTIARY.
OZ,
WHERE AFTER MONTHS OF
TENSION, A RIOT ERUPTED.
( screaming )
( Augustus )
THE UNIT KNOWN
AS "EMERALD CITY"
WAS OVERTAKEN
BY ITS PRISONERS.
THE GOVERNOR ORDERED
HIS TROOPS TO RECAPTURE IT
BY ANY MEANS
NECESSARY.
( gunshots )
WHEN THE SMOKE
CLEARED LITERALLY,
SIX PRISONERS AND
TWO CORRECTIONAL
OFFICERS WERE DEAD,
34 OTHERS
WERE INJURED.
SOME OVERCOME
BY THE GAS,
SOME FROM
THE BEATINGS,
SOME FROM
RIFLE WOUNDS.
( gunshots )
AMONG THOSE SHOT,
TIM McMANUS,
WHO INVENTED
EMERALD CITY,
AND SOME SAY, RAN
IT INTO THE GROUND.
THE REST OF THE PRISONERS
WERE MOVED TO GENPOP,
( loud commotion )
YOU FUCKING BITCH !
( Augustus )
EXCEPT FOR THE
RIOT LEADERS,
WHO WERE DROP-KICKED
INTO SOLITARY.
BY DAWN, PEACE
DESCENDED ON OZ.
YEAH, RIGHT.
LET ME JUST SAY
THIS ABOUT THAT.
I'VE ALREADY STARTED TO PUT
TOGETHER A GUBERNATORIAL
COMMISSION
TO INVESTIGATE, ONE:
THE CAUSES OF THE RIOT,
TWO: THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES
OF THOSE PRISONERS INVOLVED,
AND THREE: THE
APPROPRIATENESS OF
THE RESPONSE TO IT
BY WARDEN GLYNN.
GOVERNOR, WHO WILL
CHAIR THE COMMISSION ?
I'VE JUST SPOKEN TO ALVA
H CASE, DEAN OF FERBER
UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL.
HE'S AGREED TO LEAD
THE INVESTIGATION.
TO MY MIND THERE'S
NO MORE RESPECTED
JURIST IN THE STATE.
R
I CAN ASSURE YOU HIS
FINDINGS WILL BE FAI
L.
AND COMPLE
TE AND IMPARTIA
FUCK YOU, GOVERNOR.
WHAT ? AM I
ASKING SO MUCH ?
YOU WANT ME TO COME
OUT ON YOUR SIDE,
YOU WANT TO CLOSE DOWN
EMERALD CITY PERMANENTLY,
YOU WANT ME TO SAY
THAT THE PRISONERS ARE
GUILTY OF EVERYTHING,
AND YOU WERE JUSTIFIED
IN BRINGING IN
THE S.O.R.T. TEAM.
OF THE BLOOD OF
THOSE EIGHT DEAD.
.
MY HANDS ARE CLEAN
, MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR
THEN BACK OFF AND LET ME DO
WHAT YOU APPOINTED ME TO DO.
OKAY.
BUT KEEP ONE
OTHER THING IN MIND,
MARVIN SUTTL
E IS STEPPING DOWN
AL.
AS STATE'S
ATTORNEY GENER
IM.
I'M LOOKING FOR JUST THE
RIGHT MAN TO REPLACE H

DEPENDING ON

AND WE PRAY FOR THE SOULS
OF THE SIX PRISONERS
WHO DIED AS WELL.
( mumbling )
WE PRAY FOR THE RECOVERY
OF OFFICERS
JOSEPH MINEO AND
JASON ARMSTRONG,
AND FOR
TIM McMANUS.
AND, LORD,
WE ASK YOUR BLESSING
ON THIS PLACE.
WE ASK FOR
UNDERSTANDING.
WE ASK FOR PATIENCE.
WE ASK FOR THE
STRENGTH TO FORGIVE.
WE ASK TO BE FORGIVEN.
( Devlin
) I SAY NO
NEGOTIATIONS.
Y.
WE CUT OFF EM CITY'S
WATER AND ELECTRICIT
WHEN THEY'RE SITTING
IN THE DARK, WE FIRE
TEAR GAS IN THERE.
( McManus )
WHAT ABOUT
THE HOSTAGES ?
HOPEFULLY THE SORT
TEAM WILL REACH THEM.
SO THAT WE MIGHT
RENEW OURSELVES IN THIS
IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE DO.
AMEN.
AM
EN.
AMEN.
BLAME IS
A BEAUTIFUL
THING, BABY.
BLAME KEEPS THIS
WHOLE PLANET SPINNING.
YOU CAN POINT YOUR
FINGER AT THE NEXT MAN.
YOU CAN SHIFT THE
WEIGHT ONTO HIM.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARRY
THAT SHIT AROUND YOURSELF.
.
YOU CAN SLIDE INTO BED
AND GET A GOOD NIGHT'S NAP
YEAH, RIGHT.
MR. McMANUS ?
MR. McMANUS ?
ALVAH  CASE.
OH, YES.
OR.
OUR GRAND INQUISIT
THIS IS NOT AN
INQUISITION, SIR.
IT.
BULLSH
DEVLIN'S BEEN TRYING
TO DISMANTLE EM CITY
SINCE THE BEGINNING.
.
THIS IS HIS CHANCE
OOH, LEO TOLD ME
YOU'D BE TOUGH.
HE SAYS YOU TWO AREN'T
ALWAYS IN AGREEMENT.
BUT HE ADMIRES YOU
R VISION, YOUR IDEALS.
WHAT IS IT YOU
WANT EXACTLY ?
I WANT TO ASK
SOME QUESTIONS.
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.
GOVERNOR IS BUSY PICKING
THE OTHER MEMBERS
OF THE COMMISSION.
IN THE MEANTIME, I'M DOING
SOME PRELIMINARY INTERVIEWS.
I HAVE
NOTHING TO SAY.
LOOK,
ULTIMATELY IT'S GO
ING TO BE UP TO ME TO DECIDE
IF EM CITY
EVER REOPENS.
I HAVE
NOTHING TO SAY.
MINISTER SAID ?
ASALAAM ALAIKUM.
ALVAH CASE.
I'M HERE TO INTERVIEW
YOU ABOUT THE RIOT.
?
IS THAT INTERV
IEW OR INTERROGATE
I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON
WHAT YOU'RE GUILTY OF.
T.
THERE WAS NO RIO
OH, REALLY ?
LE
THERE WAS A
RIGHTEOUS STRUGG
AGAINST REPRESSION
AND INJUSTICE.
RIGHTEOUS OR NOT,
THERE ARE STILL
EIGHT BODIES
ROTTING IN
THE MORGUE.
I GRIEVE
THEIR DEATHS.
DO YOU MIND ?
PLEASE.
I UNDERSTAND THAT FROM
THE MINUTE YOU CAME TO OZ
YOU STARTED ORGANIZING
OTHER MUSLIMS,
CONVERTING STONE-COLD
KILLERS,
ALL THE WHILE SOWING
SEEDS OF DISCONTENT.
I SPOKE THE TRUTH.
THEN SPEAK IT NOW.
OH, COME ON, SAID.
YOU TALK A GOOD GAME
ABOUT THE TRUTH.
BUT HOW COME IT DOESN'T
INCLUDE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE ?
I DIDN'T FIRE
THOSE RIFLES.
DID YOU CREATE A SET
OF CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT CAUSED THE
RIFLES TO BE FIRED ?
.
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM CREATE
D THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, NOT I
SE.
YOUR COMMISSION
IS A FRAUD, CA
GOVERNOR DEVLIN,
THE ONE MAN WHOSE ACTION
S SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED
IS THE MAN THAT
APPOINTED YOU.
THAT'S LIKE ME GETTING
TO PICK THE JURY
AT MY OWN TRIAL.
YOU WANT TO
LICK MY BALLS ?

AS LONG AS IT TAKES.
AND YOU'RE ?
L.
AUGUSTUS HIL
HILL...
HEY, CAN I A
SK YOU A QUESTION ?
OT.
TWO PRISONERS
GOT RELEASED ON THE RI
EUGENE DOBBINS
, JACKSON VAHUE.
?
DOBBINS WAS HURT
PRETTY BAD. YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM
MY QUESTIONS
FIRST, HILL.
SO TELL ME IN AS MANY
WORDS AS NECESSARY
WHAT YOU THINK
LED TO THE RIOT.
THEY'RE VIOLENT,
ALL THEY KNOW
IS VIOLENCE.
THE C.O.s, MAN, THEY
TREAT US LIKE SHIT.
SOMETIMES
THE INMATES
GET BORED.
.
THEY TOOK AWAY CONJUGALS
. THEY TOOK AWAY SMOKING
NO, IT'S MORE
THAN THAT.
YOU  DENY A MAN HIS FREEDOM,
HIS FAMILY, HIS PRIVACY,
HIS DIGNITY, THEN ALL HE
HAS LEFT IS TIME TO SIMMER.
THEN EVENTUALLY THE
SIMMER BECOMES A BOIL.
WE'VE BEEN HEARING
WHISPERS THAT THE MUSLIMS
WERE GONNA START TROUBLE.
THE ARYANS
ARE PARANOID.
( Augustus )
WHAT CAUSED THE RIOT ?
TWO BRAIN-DEAD
CRACK-HEAD MOTHERFUCKERS
PLAYING CHECKERS.
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
THE WORLD IMPLODED.
FUCKING COCKSUCKER !
WE TREATED THE
HOSTAGES GOOD.
THEY TREATED
US LIKE SHIT.
WE TRIED
TO NEGOTIATE.
THEIR DEMANDS
WERE RIDICULOUS.
AND THEN THE
LIGHTS WENT OUT.
AHHH !
THERE WAS
TEAR GAS.
GUNS.
TIM McMANUS GOT
SHOT IN THE CHEST.
I SAW THE SIDE OF RODRIGO'S
HEAD GET BLOWN OFF.
K.
HUNT AND NOWAKOWSKI
WERE BOTH HIT IN THE BAC
WHAT ABOUT
SCOTT ROSS ?
WHAT ABOUT HIM ?
WELL, ACCORDING
TO THE AUTOPSY
HE WAS SHOT
THREE TIMES.
ONCE IN THE HEAD,
ONCE IN THE HEART,
AND ONCE IN
THE TESTICLES.
YE
AH.
I WAS CURIOUS.
BULLETS FLYING RANDOMLY
EVERY WHICH WAY
AND HE GETS SHOT THREE TIMES
IN THREE VERY PRECISE PLACES ?
.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT
( Augustus )
THEY SAY CURIOSITY
KILLED THE CAT.
WHAT THE FUCK
WAS THE CAT SO
CURIOUS ABOUT
THAT GOT
HIM KILLED ?
( singing )
( Augustus )
SOLITARY SUCKS, MAN.
IF YOU REALLY WANT
SOME COMPANY,
YOU JUST GOTTA GO
THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.
JUST WHAT I LOVE, MY
PRISON IN LOCKDOWN,
CRAWLING WITH OUTSIDE
INVESTIGATORS
AND TV CAMERAS.
WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID WE'LL FIND ?
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'LL FIND BUT
THE WAY YOU FIND IT. THESE
QUESTIONS STIR THINGS UP.
AND GOD KNOWS EVERYONE'S
STIRRED UP ENOUGH RIGHT NOW.
LEO, WHO WAS
SCOTT ROSS ?
ROSS ?
WELL, HE WAS A
BIKER, DRUG DEALER,
THREE STRIKES LIFER, WHY ?
WELL,
I'M NOT SURE YET
BUT ROSS MAY HAVE
BEEN MURDERED.
WHAT ?
DURING THE SORT
TEAM'S ATTACK
HE MAY HAVE BEEN
KILLED DELIBERATELY.
WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT ?
HE WAS SHOT THREE TIME
S, ALMOST EXECUTION STYLE.
s,
AND THE BULLETS IN
ROSS' BODY WERE 9mm'
S,
NOT DOUBLE-OUGHT
.
WHICH WERE
IN SORT RIFLES
THE SORT TEAM USES
9mm IN A HANDGUN.
RIGHT.
SO SORT TEAM MEMBER A,
HE ENTERS THE COMMON
ROOM IN EM CITY,
LOWERS HIS RIFLE,
ROSS COMES AT HIM
FROM OUT OF THE DARK,
HE RAISES HIS HANDGUN,
FIRES, THAT'S NOT MURDER.
YOU THROW A BULLET
IN SOMEONE'S BRAIN,
YOU PRETTY MUCH
FIGURE HE'S DONE.
MAYBE HE SHOT HIM
IN THE HEART FIRST,
G.
OR THE BALLS A
ND ROSS  KEPT COMIN
YEAH, BUT THE BULLET
FROM ROSS' BRAIN
WAS IN THE WALL BELOW THE
COMMAND CENTER BY A TV.
AND THE ONE THAT WENT
THROUGH HIS HEART
WAS EMBEDDED
IN THE FLOOR.
SO UNLESS HE DIED
FALLING UPWARDS...
IT'S MURDER.
( grunting )
( blowing whistle )
( Augustus )
IN ALL THAT CHAOS,
WHAT A PERFECT
CHANCE TO OFF ROSS,
AND GET AWAY WITH
IT, SCOTT-FREE.
THAT'S HIM
OVER THERE.
OFFICER HEIM ?
THE BULLETS THAT
KILLED ROSS
CAME FROM THE
SAME BOX
AS THE ONES THAT YOU
PUT IN YOUR HANDGUN.
SO ?
S.
SO YOUR GUN WAS
USED TO KILL ROS
UH-HUH.
YET YOU DON'T MENTION FIRING
AT HIM IN YOUR REPORT.
I DIDN'T.
?
THEN WHO DID
I DON'T KNOW.
( gunshots )
?
DID YOU HAND YOU
R GUN TO SOMEONE
NO.
?
WAS IT IN YOUR HOLST
ER WHEN YOU ENTERED EM CITY
YES.
AND THEN ?
IT DISAPPEARED.
DID YOU FEEL
ANYONE TAKE IT ?
NO, THINGS WERE CRAZY
IN THERE, YOU KNOW ?
HAPPENING
PRETTY FAST.
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
UN
THAT SOMEONE
LIFTED THE HANDG
G ?
OUT OF YOUR HOLSTER
WITHOUT YOU KNOWIN
THAT'S RIGHT.
TTY
WELL, HOW COME YOU DID
N'T MENTION THAT LITTLE DI
IN YOUR REPORT ?
BECAUSE I FOUND
IT ON THE FLOOR.

R WEAPONS MORE THAN PUSSY.

YOU'D DIE BEFORE
LETTING ANYONE TAKE
AND YOU'D SURE AS CHRIST
KNOW IT WAS GONE.
?
WHO ARE YOU
COVERING FOR, HUH
SCOTT ROSS WAS A
LOW-LIFE SCUM FUCK
JUST LIKE ALL THOSE
OTHER SCUM FUCKS IN THERE.
THEY HURT
ARMSTRONG AND MINEO.
BECAUSE OF THEM, HUNT
AND NOWAKOWSKI DIED.
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
GOING AFTER SOME C.O.
BECAUSE THEY WHACKED A
FUCKING PIG LIKE ROSS ?
WHO THE FUCK'S
SIDE ARE YOU ON ?
THE LAW, I'M ON
THE LAW'S SIDE.
.
NOW YOU CAN GO
THANK YOU.

A BAD MEMORY

BE A GOOD LIAR
IF YOU GOT
A BAD MEMORY.

NOW HUNT AND NOWAKOWSKI

OF THE ASSAULT AND
McMANUS WAS SHOT

THAT HE KILLED ROSS.
WHAT MAKES YOU SO

WHY NOT A PRISONER ?
ROSS WASN'T EXACTLY BELOVED
BY HIS FELLOW INMATES.

HYGIENE PROBLEM.
DID HE EVE
R MENTION HAVING A
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH
ANYONE ON THE STAFF ?
AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE FILES,

CARE OF MYSELF.
AT.
YEAH, I CAN SEE TH
BUT HOW ?
I'M LIKE THE LORD
OF THE FUCKING DANCE.
I GOT MOVES.
YEAH, I'LL
BET YOU DO.
T,
OF ALL THE GUYS
THAT LED THE RIO
YOU WERE THE ONLY ON
E WITH NO FIRE BEHIND YOU.
YET THE OTHERS
INCLUDED YOU
IN ALL T
HE DECISION MAKING.
I HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH THE RIOT.
OH, I GUESS
I WAS MISINFORMED.
I GUESS YOU WERE.
E
LIKE I HEARD FRO
M WHAT I THOUGHT WAS
A RELIABLE SOURC
THAT YOU AND
ROSS WERE CLOSE.
CLOSE, NO ?
.
THAT YOU AND
HE WERE LOVERS
NOW, WHO THE FUCK
TOLD YOU THAT ?
E.
ROSS POURED HIS HEART
OUT TO SISTER PETER MARI
HEY, LOOK, I'M
NO FAG, PAL.
BUT IF I WERE,
I WOULDN'T PUT MY
DICK ANYWHERE NEAR
ROSS'S SCUM HOLE.
THAT COCKSUCKER WOULD
FUCK ANYTHING ON
TWO OR FOUR LEGS.
YEAH, WELL
WHAT ABOUT C.O.s,
DID ROSS EVER
FUCK ONE OF THEM ?
HOW ABOUT SOME
HELP GETTING ME
OUT OF THIS PLACE ?
E
SORRY, YOU'RE NO
T GOING ANY PLAC
UNTIL THE
INVESTIGATION
IS OVER.
WELL, THEN HOW
ABOUT A CIGARETTE ?
OH, THIS IS GOOD.
WHEN I'M DONE
PUFFING ON THIS,
I CAN SUCK ON MY OWN
SECONDHAND SMOKE.
,
SO
ROSS HAD A THING
FOR WITTLESEY.
?
YEAH
YEAH.
HE CLAIMED THEY KNEW
EACH OTHER ON THE
OUTSIDE. IT MAKES SENSE.
THEY WERE ALWAYS
SNEAKING OFF AND
WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER.
?
WHAT'S THE MATTER
THIS GUY, CASE, HE
GIVES ME THE CREEPS.
WHY ?
YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.
HE'LL DO HIS INQUIRY,
HE'LL BE GONE.
YUP.
RIGHT ?
YEAH, I GUESS.
THEY ALSO SAY IF YOU REPEAT
A LIE OFTEN ENOUGH,
IT BECOMES THE TRUTH,
OR AT LEAST YOU
CONVINCE YOURSELF
IT'S THE FUCKING GOSPEL.
YOU RUN THE ARYAN
BROTHERHOOD, MR.
SCHILLINGER ?
O.
I USED T
YOU HAVE A PAROLE
DATE COMING UP.
YUP.
YOU THINK YOU GOT A
CHANCE OF GETTING OUT ?
O,
I HOPE S
MY SONS NEED ME.
WELL, I'D BE HAPPY
TO PUT A LETTER
OF RECOMMENDATION
IN YOUR FILE.
T.
IF I HELP YOU OU
THAT'S RIGHT.
SCOTT ROSS.
POOR SON-OF-A-BITCH.
SO YOU WERE FRIENDS ?
( laughing )
DID HE EVER
MENTION HAVING A
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH OFFICER WITTLESEY ?
RE.
SU
.
ROSS AND WITTLESEY'S E
X WERE IN THE SAME BIKE CLUB
ROSS SAID HE NAILED HE
R BEHIND HER HUBBY'S BACK,
BUT THEN AGAIN,
ROSS WAS SOMETIMES
A LYING SACK OF SHIT,
SO WHO KNOWS
IF IT'S TRUE.
DID ANYTHING GO ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM
SINCE HE CAME TO OZ ?
S,
ACCORDING TO ROS
.
HE WAS BANGING
HER PRETTY REGULAR
YOU THINK HE WAS
LYING ABOUT THAT ?
PROBABLY.
Y.
THANK YOU FOR GETT
ING ME PERMISSION TO
COME TO THE LIBRAR
LOCKDOWNS CAN BE BORING
WITH NOTHING TO READ.
OH, NO PROBLEM.
THEY TELL ME YOU
KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT GOES ON IN OZ.
THEY EXAGGERATE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEA, IF ANYTHING,
WHAT TRANSPIRED BETWEEN
OFFICER WITTLESEY
AND SCOTT ROSS ?
CIGARETTES.
I BEG YOUR PARDON.
CIGARETTES WAS WHAT WA
S GOING ON BETWEEN THEM.
WITTLESEY SMUGGLED
THEM IN, A CARTON A DAY.
SHE GAVE THEM TO ROS
S TO SELL. EVERYTHIN
G WAS GOING SMOOTHLY
UNTIL McMANUS
FOUND OUT.
HE MADE WITTLESEY SHUT
DOWN THE OPERATION.
SO ROSS HATED
McMANUS FOR THAT.
AND BECAUSE WITTLESEY
AND McMANUS STARTED
SLEEPING TOGETHER.
HEY, GOT A
CIGARETTE ?
YEAH, WHY WOULD
YOU ? ROSS IS DEAD.
IT'S FUNNY
, YOU KNOW,
WHAT A GUY CAN
SEE WITH ONE EYE,
AS.
IN THE DARK,
THROUGH THE TEAR G
DON'T WORRY.
I DIDN'T TELL THAT NIGGER,
CASE, A FUCKING THING.
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME ?
WELL, I GOT A
PAROLE HEARING
COMING UP.
I THINK MAYBE THE
BEST THING FOR YOU
E.
WOULD BE FOR M
E TO BE OUT OF HER
SO YOU THINK
WITTLESEY
KILLED ROSS ?
SHE HAD MOTIVE,
OPPORTUNITY.
I'VE KNO
WN DIANE FOR YEARS.
DON'T WALK IN HERE
AND TALK ABOUT MOTIVE
AND OPPORTUNITY !
GIVE ME SOME
EVIDENCE.
IN THE HEAT OF THE RIOT,
MAYBE SHE JUST LOST IT.
T.
NO, IT HAD TO BE A MORE
SPECIFIC REASON THAN THA
ROSS HAD TO HAVE DON
E SOMETHING AT THAT MOMENT
TO GET HER TO
PULL THE TRIGGER.
( phone )
O.
HELL
YEAH, OKAY, OKAY.
OFFICER SAYS A PRISONER
WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.
WHICH ONE ?
TOBIAS BEECHER.
HEY, CHIEF.
YOU ASKED
TO SEE ME ?
I GOT A SECRET.
ABOUT ?
SCOTT ROSS.
TELL ME.
IF I TELL YOU, IT
WON'T BE A SECRET.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE
US PLEASE ?
OKAY.
I BIT THE TIP OFF
A GUY'S PENIS.
.
SO I HEARD
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID ?
WELL, I'VE GOT
MY PANTS ON.
( laughing )
I USED TO BE A LAWYER,
YOU KNOW THAT ?
.
UH-HUH
I WENT TO HARVARD.
SO DID I.
RAH, RAH, CRIMSON...
I'VE BEEN UNDER A LOT
OF STRESS LATELY.
I HAVEN'T BEEN
BEHAVING VERY NICELY,
LIKE THIS BITING THING.
BUT I'M USING
MY TIME IN HERE
TO TURN MY
HEAD AROUND.
WHEN I GET OUT OF
HERE, I'M GONNA BE
A BETTER PERSON.
THIS WHOLE
BITING THING
JUST ISN'T WORKING
FOR ME, YOU KNOW ?
SO AS A SIGN THAT I'M ON
THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW,
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
MY LITTLE SECRET
AND THEN I'LL BE ON
THE ROAD BACK, RIGHT ?
YEAH, YEAH.
I SAW THE
SHOTS FIRED.
WHICH SHOTS ?
CHECK THE BULLETS.
THE BULLETS THAT
KILLED ROSS ?
NO.
CHECK THE BULLETS
IN McMANUS.
HEY !
m
McMANUS WASN'T
SHOT WITH A 9m
UN.
FROM THE S
ORT TEAM HANDG
m,
THE STRIATIONS SHOW
HE WAS HIT WITH A 9m
ER.
PROBABLY FROM A
GLOCK OR A SIG-SAU
SIG-SAUER, WELL WE
KNOW THERE WAS A SIG-SAUER
IN EM CITY DURING THE RIOT.
?
WHOSE WAS IT
KAREEM SAID.
YOU SHOT
TIM McMANUS.
NO.
WELL, IF YOU
DIDN'T, WHO DID ?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HAD A SIG-SAUER
IN YOUR POSSESSION.
N.
IF I SAY YES, THAT'S
ANOTHER NAIL IN MY COFFI
?
DO I LOOK LIKE
A FOOL TO YOU
ARE YOU
COMFORTABLE HERE ?
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
IT'S UP TO ME
WHEN AND IF YOU GET OUT
OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.
NOW I KNOW HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS FOR YOU
TO BE AMONG
YOUR PEOPLE,
LEADING, GUIDING,
NURTURING THEM.
THAT'S GONNA BE HARD TO DO
THROUGH EIGHT TONS OF STEEL.
YOU'RE AN
ACADEMIC, RIGHT ?
YOU KNOW ABOUT HYPOTHESES
AND THEORIES, RIGHT ?
WELL,
THEORETICALLY
SPEAKING,
D,
IF I HAD A GUN WHEN
THE SORT TEAM ENTERE
HERE'S WHAT MIGH
T HAVE HAPPENED.
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
UNDERNEATH THE CONTROL PANEL
AT THE COMMAND STATION
HOLDING THAT GUN.
WHEN THE SORT TEAM
MEMBER CAME IN
AND STARTED
TO BEAT ME,
AND IN NOT WANTING
TO KILL ANYBODY,
.
I MIGHT HAVE THROW
N THAT GUN OVER THE SIDE
WHERE SOMEONE ELSE
PICKED IT UP.
THEORETICALLY
SPEAKING, YES.
ME,
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING TO SAY TO
.
BUT I HAVE A COUPLE OF
THINGS TO SAY TO YOU
FIRST, YOU'VE
GOT BALLS.
ITY
YOU VOLUNTARIL
Y WENT INTO EM C
TO NEGOTIATE THE RELEA
SE OF THE INJURED OFFICERS
AND DIANE WITTLESEY.
+YOU TRADED YOURSELF FOR
ARMSTRONG AND MINEO,
PUTTING YOURSELF IN WHAT
COULD ONLY BE CALLED
N.
A JACK
POT SITUATIO
NDS
ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT
YOU'D FALL INTO THE HA
OF SCOTT ROSS, A
MAN YOU DESPISED.
HOW IRONIC IS IT
THEN THAT HE WAS THE
ONE WHO SHOT YOU.
ANY LAST WORDS ?
SUCK MY DICK.
WHO TOLD YOU ?
?
THAT ROSS WAS
THE ONE THAT SHOT YOU
YEAH.
YOU JUST DID.
YOU KNOW, OZ,
IS JUST LIKE
ANY PLACE ELSE.
EVERYBODY LOVES TO GOSSIP
ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE.
NOT ME.
OU.
OH, BUT THEY
GOSSIP ABOUT Y
E
WELL, MAYBE IT'S 'CAUS
YOU'RE ONE OF THE
FEW WOMEN AROUND.
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
THERE'S TRUTH TO
THE RUMORS.
E,
LIKE, FOR EXAMPL
THAT YOU WERE SMUGGLING
CIGARETTES IN
LL.
THAT ROSS COULD SE
R.
AND THAT YOU AND
McMANUS HAD AN AFFAI
YOU ACCUSING ME
OF SOMETHING ?
YES, YES, I AM.
YOU, YOU KILLED
SCOTT ROSS.
ME ? HOW DID I DO THAT ?
N.
ROSS PICKE
D UP SAID'S GU
HE FIRED INTO
McMANUS'S CHEST, BANG !
YOU TOOK OFFICER HEIM'S
PISTOL AND SHOT ROSS.
BANG, BANG, BANG.
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
MY HANDS WERE TIED
BEHIND MY BACK.
NO, THEY WEREN'T.
YOU MANAGED TO LOOSE
THE BINDS BEFORE IT
ALL CAME DOWN.
YOU TOLD ME THAT
AFTER McMANUS FELL
TO THE GROUND, YOU,
QUOTE, "I CRADLED HIM
IN MY ARMS," END QUOTE.
HOW COULD YOU
CRADLE HIM
WITH YOUR ARMS
BEHIND YOUR BACK ?
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN IN A RIOT ?
NO.
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S INVOLVED.
THE IDEA OF BEING
A HOSTAGE, THE
MOB MENTALITY,
YOU GET CARRIED AWAY,
YOU STOP BEING HUMAN.
YOU BECOME PART
OF SOMETHING ELSE.
I HAVE MADE EVERY
MISTAKE THERE IS.
I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH THE WRONG MEN,
I HAD A BABY
OUT OF WEDLOCK,
I DRANK TOO MUCH,
I SNORTED TOO MUCH.
I HAVE DONE THINGS
TO MAKE MONEY,
INCLUDING THIS JOB,
WHICH MAKE ME DREAD
GETTING OUT OF BED.
BUT EACH TIME I
MADE THE CHOICE.
I CHOSE TO DRINK,
I CHOSE TO STOP.
WHEN MY HUSBAND GOT
ABUSIVE, I CHOSE TO WALK.
I REFUSE TO BE
ANYBODY'S VICTIM.
THESE MISTAKES I'VE MADE,
THEY ARE A PART OF ME.
THEY ARE LIKE MY SKIN.
AND I DO NOT REGRET
WHAT I'VE DONE.
DO YOU HEAR ME ?
NO REGRETS,
NO REMORSE.
I JUST KEEP GOING.
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ?
WHEN I KNOW,
YOU'LL KNOW.
SHE HAS A YOUN
G DAUGHTER, A MOTHER
IN AND OUT OF CHEMO.
SO WHAT, LEO,
SO WHAT ?
TH,
SO IF YOU
EXPOSE THE TRU
YOU DESTROY THIS WOMAN'S
LIFE AND HER DAUGHTER'S.
AND FOR WHAT, SCOT
T FUCKING ROSS ?!
E.
COME ON ALVAH, PLEAS
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY, LEO ?
TO SAY THAT ROSS DIED
LIKE THE OTHERS,
M
FROM BULLETS FIRED BY
A MEMBER OF THE SORT TEA
IN THE PERFORMANCE
OF HIS DUTY.
I JUST READ THE PRELIMINARY
DRAFT OF YOUR REPORT.
WHAT'S WRONG ?
YOU RECOMMEND NOT FILING
CHARGES AGAINST SAID
AND THE RIOT LEADERS ?!
FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT,
THE EVIDENCE IS
CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
FROM A MORAL STANDPOINT,
IT'S LAUGHABLE.
LOOK, GOVERNOR
, AS FAR AS I CAN SEE,
WHATEVER THEY
DID CAME ABOUT
AS A DIRECT RESULT
OF YOUR ACTIONS !
.
YOU'VE EXONERATED ME.
OH, YEAH, YEAH
YOUR COMMISSION BEHAVE
D LIKE GOOD LITTLE BOYS.
S.
BUT YOU CAN'T
HAVE IT BOTH WAY
IF THE PRISONERS ARE
GUILTY, SO ARE YOU.
THIS IS NOT THE KIND
OF ATTITUDE I EXPECT
FROM AN
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
YEAH, WELL, I'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
I WANT TO BE GOVERNOR.
WHAT ?
I'LL SEE YOU
ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL, DEVLIN.
NOW, I'VE GOT A PRESS
CONFERENCE TO DO.
IT IS THE CONSIDERED
OPINION OF THIS COMMISSION
THAT THOUGH
THE RIOT ITSELF
AND THE DEATHS THAT
FOLLOWED ARE TRAGIC,
NO ONE IN PARTICULAR
IS AT FAULT.
( reporter chatter )
WE DO FEEL THAT THERE
ARE CERTAIN MEASURES
THAT CAN BE
TAKEN TO INSURE
THAT AN EVENT LIKE THIS
DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.
BITCH.
( Augustus )
SO, AS IT TURNS OUT,
NO ONE WAS TO
BLAME FOR THE RIOT.
IN FACT, IF NO
ONE WAS TO BLAME,
THAT MEANS NOTHING
BAD HAPPENED.
NOTHING AT
ALL HAPPENED.
SO LIFE CAN PRETTY MUCH
GO ON AS IT HAS BEFORE.
( Augustus )
SO THERE USED TO
BE THIS TRIBE,
THE AZTECS,
WHO BELIEVED THAT
THE UNIVERSE WAS
CREATED BY VIOLENCE.
EVERY YEAR WHAT WAS THEIR
VERSION OF CHRISTMAS,
THEY WOULD CUT OUT
SOMEONE'S HEART
AND OFFER IT UP
TO THE GODS.
THESE PEOPLE WERE CONVINCE
THAT WITHOUT THIS SACRIFICE,
THE SUN WOULD FALL
FROM THE SKY
AND THE WORLD WOULD
COME TO AN END.
THEN THE
SPANIARDS LANDED,
WIPED THE AZTECS OFF
THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
TURNS OUT
THEY WAS RIGHT.
THE WORLD DID
COME TO AN END,
FOR THEM.
WELCOME TO OZ.
10 MONTHS AFTER
THE WORLD ENDED.
(McManus )
ALRIGHT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE
THOUGHT WE'D NEVER
REOPEN EMERALD CITY
BUT AFTER
ALMOST A YEAR,
A LOT OF POLITICING,
BALL-BUSTING,
AND SOME BACK UP
FROM THE WARDEN,
HERE WE ARE.
IT'S A NEW
DEAL, GENTLEMEN.
IT'S A BETTER DEAL,
IT'S A FAIR DEAL.
NOW I HAVE
IDENTIFIED
10 GROUPS.
THE MUSLIMS,
THE GANGSTERS,
THE LATINOS,
THE ITALIANS,
THE IRISH,
THE ARYANS,
THE BIKERS,
THE CHRISTIANS,
THE GAYS, AND ONE
CALLED THE OTHERS.
EACH GROUP WILL
HAVE FOUR PRISONERS
LIVING AT EM CITY.
NO MORE, NO LESS.
EACH GROUP WILL BE EQUAL,
EACH INDIVIDUAL, EQUAL.
BULLSHIT.
NO, IT IS
NOT BULLSHIT,
AND TO MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S NOT
I'M ALSO
ESTABLISHING
A COUNCIL
TO AIR GRIEVANCES,
TO ADVISE ME.
EACH GROUP WILL HAVE ONE
MEMBER SERVE ON SAID COUNCIL.
ANY QUESTIONS ?
YES, GIVEN ALL
THAT'S HAPPENED,
WHY DID YOU
COME BACK ?
WHY DO YOU STILL BELIEVE
EMERALD CITY WILL WORK ?
WELL, THE
TRUTH IS THIS.
WE EITHER LEARN TO CHANGE
OR WE REPEAT OUR MISTAKES.
WE EITHER BECOME A
PART OF OUR COMMUNITY,
OR WE REMAIN
ISOLATED FROM IT.
IN EITHER CASE
THE SUCCESS OF OUR
LIVES DEPENDS ON US.
I AM NOT SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
TO MAKE EM CITY WORK.
IT'S YOU TOO.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ?
( buzzing )
BE
KAREEM, YOU SHOULD
OUR REPRESENTATIVE
ON THE COUNCIL.
THAT'S ASSUMING
THAT WE PARTICIPATE.
YOU SAYING WE SHOULDN'
T ?
NO, I'M SAYING
THAT WE WAIT.
OUR ABSENCE MAY SPEAK
LOUDER THAN OUR PRESENCE.
( Adebisi )
FIRST THING, WE START
TO SELL TITS AGAIN.
YEAH, BUT WHAT
ABOUT O'REILY ?
I'LL HANDLE O'REILLY.
I'LL HANDLE ADEBISI.
WHAT WORRIES ME IS
THE SICILIANS COMING IN.
I DON'T SEE
NINO SCHIBETTA
ANYWHERE.
SCHIBETTA'S DEAD.
IT'S HIS SON WHO'S THE
HAIR ACROSS OUR ASS NOW.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
BACK THE DRUG TRADE
AND FIND OUT WHO HURT
MY FATHER AND THEN....
SHIT.
THE REST OF THESE
COCK MOTHERFUCKERS.
THEY GONNA
LEARN, BRO.
THEY CAN'T SHIT
ON US NO MORE.
HOW THE FUCK DID I GET
TO BE AN OTHER ? ON THE
STREETS I WAS SELLING DOPE.
I WAS AS BAD AS ANY
OF THOSE HOMEBOYS. I
FUCKING KILLED A COP !
WHAT AM I DOING
HERE WITH YOU GUYS ?

RECORDING SECRETARY.
ANYONE KNOW
HOW TO WRITE ?
I'LL DO IT.
I'M FAMOUS FOR
MY PENMANSHIP.
HERE YOU GO,
WATCH OUT.
NOW A LOT OF YOU MEN HAVE
HAD RAW DEALS GROWING UP.
ABUSIVE PARENTS,
SHITTY HOUSING, NO JOBS.

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
ND.
TO TURN YOUR
LIVES AROU

OH YEAH ? AND HO
W YOU GONNA DO THAT
INITIALLY WITH
EDUCATION.
.
OVER HALF THE INMATES IN O
Z NEVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL
THE FEDERAL PRISON SYSTEM HAS
MANDATORY EDUCATION PROGRAMS
IN PLACE SINCE 1982.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THE SAME REQUIREMENTS
IN EMERALD CITY.
.
THERE'S ALREADY
A PROGRAM.
IT'S NOT MANDATORY
WHO CARES, MAN ?
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS
WE START BRINGING
BACK THEM CONJUGALS.
HOW ABOUT SOME
FUCKING CIGARETTES ?
ONE THING AT
A TIME, GU
YS, EDUCATION FIRST.
SINCE IT'S MANDATORY,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
MORE STUDENTS,
THEREFORE,
WE'RE GONNA NE

I'M ASKING

FILES YOU USED TO TEAC
H HIGH SCHOOL BRIEFLY.
YEAH.
HOW ABOUT HELPING
US OUT HERE ?
OKAY.
.
WHAT A TROOPER
SAID...
THE MUSLIMS WEREN'T
REPRESENTED AT THE
COUNCIL MEETING.
IF THIS COUNCIL
HAS REAL POWER,
THEN WE WILL
PARTICIPATE.
WELL,  HOW DO
YOU MEAN ?
DO WE GET TO MAKE
POLICY OR DO WE SIMPLY
RUBBER-STAMP YOURS ?
THIS IS A PRISON,
NOT A DEMOCRACY.
OH, I KNOW THAT
ONLY TOO WELL.
I MEANT WHAT I SAID
ABOUT A SECOND CHANCE.
I WANT TO DO IT
RIGHT THIS TIME.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
PARTICIPATE, FINE. JUST
DON'T GET IN MY WAY.
McMANUS, YOU WANT

EN.
BUT THAT W

AND WHEN I WAS

WELL, THE REVERSE
IS ALSO TRUE.
YOU CANNOT FORCE
SOMEONE TO LEARN.
I CAN TRY.
THEM AZTECS,
THEY HAD THIS KID,
MONTEZUMA THE SECOND.
THAT'S THE HALLS
OF MONTEZUMA GUY.
ONE NIGHT MONTEZUMA SAW
THIS FLAMING EAR OF CORN
SHOOT ACROSS
THE SKY.
A COMET.
MONTEZUMA SAW THIS
COMET AS AN OMEN,
THE SIGN OF HIS

YEAH, THEY HAD THE
HORSES AND THE CANNONS,
BUT THEY ALSO BROUGHT
OVER SMALLPOX.
IT WAS A DISEASE THAT
FINALLY FINISHED THE JOB.
A DISEASE THE SPANISH
GAVE THE AZTECS
WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING.
IN OZ WE DO WHAT
WE CAN TO SURVIVE,
BUT ULTIMATELY,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
( Augustus )
SO THERE USED TO
BE THIS TRIBE,
THE AZTECS,
WHO BELIEVED THAT
THE UNIVERSE WAS
CREATED BY VIOLENCE.
EVERY YEAR WHAT WAS THEIR
VERSION OF CHRISTMAS,
THEY WOULD CUT OUT
SOMEONE'S HEART
AND OFFER IT UP
TO THE GODS.
THESE PEOPLE WERE CONVINCE
THAT WITHOUT THIS SACRIFICE,
THE SUN WOULD FALL
FROM THE SKY
AND THE WORLD WOULD
COME TO AN END.
THEN THE
SPANIARDS LANDED,
WIPED THE AZTECS OFF
THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
TURNS OUT
THEY WAS RIGHT.
THE WORLD DID
COME TO AN END,
FOR THEM.
WELCOME TO OZ.
10 MONTHS AFTER
THE WORLD ENDED.
(McManus )
ALRIGHT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE
THOUGHT WE'D NEVER
REOPEN EMERALD CITY
BUT AFTER
ALMOST A YEAR,
A LOT OF POLITICING,
BALL-BUSTING,
AND SOME BACK UP
FROM THE WARDEN,
HERE WE ARE.
IT'S A NEW
DEAL, GENTLEMEN.
IT'S A BETTER DEAL,
IT'S A FAIR DEAL.
NOW I HAVE
IDENTIFIED
10 GROUPS.
THE MUSLIMS,
THE GANGSTERS,
THE LATINOS,
THE ITALIANS,
THE IRISH,
THE ARYANS,
THE BIKERS,
THE CHRISTIANS,
THE GAYS, AND ONE
CALLED THE OTHERS.
EACH GROUP WILL
HAVE FOUR PRISONERS
LIVING AT EM CITY.
NO MORE, NO LESS.
EACH GROUP WILL BE EQUAL,
EACH INDIVIDUAL, EQUAL.
BULLSHIT.
NO, IT IS
NOT BULLSHIT,
AND TO MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S NOT
I'M ALSO
ESTABLISHING
A COUNCIL
TO AIR GRIEVANCES,
TO ADVISE ME.
EACH GROUP WILL HAVE ONE
MEMBER SERVE ON SAID COUNCIL.
ANY QUESTIONS ?
YES, GIVEN ALL
THAT'S HAPPENED,
WHY DID YOU
COME BACK ?
WHY DO YOU STILL BELIEVE
EMERALD CITY WILL WORK ?
WELL, THE
TRUTH IS THIS.
WE EITHER LEARN TO CHANGE
OR WE REPEAT OUR MISTAKES.
WE EITHER BECOME A
PART OF OUR COMMUNITY,
OR WE REMAIN
ISOLATED FROM IT.
IN EITHER CASE
THE SUCCESS OF OUR
LIVES DEPENDS ON US.
I AM NOT SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
TO MAKE EM CITY WORK.
IT'S YOU TOO.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ?
( buzzing )
BE
KAREEM, YOU SHOULD
OUR REPRESENTATIVE
ON THE COUNCIL.
THAT'S ASSUMING
THAT WE PARTICIPATE.
YOU SAYING WE SHOULDN'
T ?
NO, I'M SAYING
THAT WE WAIT.
OUR ABSENCE MAY SPEAK
LOUDER THAN OUR PRESENCE.
( Adebisi )
FIRST THING, WE START
TO SELL TITS AGAIN.
YEAH, BUT WHAT
ABOUT O'REILY ?
I'LL HANDLE O'REILLY.
I'LL HANDLE ADEBISI.
WHAT WORRIES ME IS
THE SICILIANS COMING IN.
I DON'T SEE
NINO SCHIBETTA
ANYWHERE.
SCHIBETTA'S DEAD.
IT'S HIS SON WHO'S THE
HAIR ACROSS OUR ASS NOW.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
BACK THE DRUG TRADE
AND FIND OUT WHO HURT
MY FATHER AND THEN....
SHIT.
THE REST OF THESE
COCK MOTHERFUCKERS.
THEY GONNA
LEARN, BRO.
THEY CAN'T SHIT
ON US NO MORE.
HOW THE FUCK DID I GET
TO BE AN OTHER ? ON THE
STREETS I WAS SELLING DOPE.
I WAS AS BAD AS ANY
OF THOSE HOMEBOYS. I

INITIALLY WITH
EDUCATION.

IN PLACE SINCE 1982.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE

IT'S NOT MANDATORY
WHO CARES, MAN ?
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS

YS, EDUCATION FIRST.
SINCE IT'S MANDATORY,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE

SAID...
THE MUSLIMS WEREN'T
REPRESENTED AT THE
COUNCIL MEETING.
IF THIS COUNCIL
HAS REAL POWER,
THEN WE WILL
PARTICIPATE.
WELL,  HOW DO
YOU MEAN ?
DO WE GET TO MAKE
POLICY OR DO WE SIMPLY
RUBBER-STAMP YOURS ?
THIS IS A PRISON,
NOT A DEMOCRACY.
OH, I KNOW THAT
ONLY TOO WELL.
I MEANT WHAT I SAID
ABOUT A SECOND CHANCE.
I WANT TO DO IT
RIGHT THIS TIME.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO

TO ACCEPT THE REALITY OF
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM,

TO FIGHT THE DISEA
I HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH
HIM. I'LL TALK TO HIM.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I SHOULD.
HE'LL FEEL MORE
COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT
IT WITH ANOTHER GUY.

GANGING UP ON HIM.
I GOT THE PERFECT

MR. BOOKER T.
WASHINGTON WRITES:
"I HAVE GREAT FAITH
"IN THE POWER AND
INFLUENCE OF FACT.
"IT IS SELDOM THAT ANYTHING
IS PERMANENTLY GAINED BY
HOLDING BACK FACT."
YOU WANT
SOME FACTS ?
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
REPORTS THAT THE TYPICAL
PRISONER IN AMERICA
IS AN UNDER-EDUCATED
YOUNG MALE MINORITY,
BUT YOU COULD
HAVE GUESSED THAT.
IF THAT UNDER-EDUCATED
YOUNG MALE MINORITY
RECEIVES HIS G.E.D.
IN PRISON,
HE IS FAR LESS
LIKELY TO COME BACK.
ANYBODY WANT TO
READ OUT LOUD ?
W.E.B. DUBOIS,
LET'S HAVE KENNY...
IF THAT SAME KID MANAGES
TO GO TO COLLEGE
WHILE HE'S INSIDE,
HE'LL ALMOST
DEFINITELY NEVER SEE
A PRISON CELL AGAIN.
JUST PICK ANY
PAGE YOU WANT.
LAST YEAR, ONE
STATE, CALIFORNIA,
SPENT MORE MONEY
ON ITS PENAL SYSTEM
THAN IT DID ON
HIGHER EDUCATION.
THESE ARE THE
FACTS AND FIGURES.
YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE THAT
SMART TO ADD THEM UP.

AN ACCIDENT,
I HEARD.
FELL OFF THE BACK OF A
TRUCK, BROKE HIS NECK.
THAT'S TRUE, BUT IT
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE WORKS HERE ?
HER HUSBAND WAS
PUSHED OFF THE TRUCK.
HE WAS MURDERED.

THE ANNOTATED CODE.
YOU GIVING UP GOD
FOR THE LAW ?
GOD'S LAWS ARE
CLEAR TO ME.
IT'S THOSE OF MAN
THAT ARE NOT.
I'VE BEEN STUDYING LEGAL BOOKS
FOR THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS,
TRYING TO SEE IF GOD'S LAW
S AND THOSE OF THE WHITE MAN
HAVE ANYTHIN
G IN COMMON.
WHAT HAVE YOU
DISCOVERED ?
THAT THESE ARE NOTHING
BUT WORDS ON A PAGE.
D.
THE ANNOTATED CODE EXI
STS SOLELY TO BE CIRCUMVENTE
WITHOUT LAW, WE
HAVE ANARCHY.
.
YOU SHOULD READ YOUR
MORNING PAPER, OLD MAN

WE HAVE
ANARCHY ANYWAY

YOU CAN'T OVERTHROW
THE SYSTEM.

ST IN SEEING MORE MEN DIE
NO.
I INTEND TO USE
THE TOOLS THAT WERE
USED AGAINST ME.
I INTEND TO MAKE THE LAW
DEVOUR ITSELF.
Judge Richard Kibler
was sentenced today
to 16 months in prison.
The 12-year veteran of The
State Criminal Court was
convicted of taking bribes
in exchange for leniency
in three murder cases
he presided over...
YOU HEAR THIS ?
COCKSUCKER KIBLER
WAS THE JUDGE AT
MY FUCKING TRIAL.
FOR REAL ?
SHIT, YEAH.
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN
THE MOTHERFUCKER
WAS UP FOR BRIBES,
I'D HAVE PUT MY
TWO DOLLARS DOWN.
SHIT AIN'T FAIR.
YOU'RE RIGHT,

THAT KIBLER TOOK
BRIBES IN NOVEMBER
E
YOU WEREN'T APPROACHED
BY HIM OR ANYONE ELS
ABOUT TAKING
BRIBES ?
( Augustus )
NOBODY SAID
DICK TO ME.
DID HE TALK TO
YOUR LAWYER ?
IF THEY DID, HE NEVER
SAID WORD ONE TO ME.
GOOD, THAT'S GOOD, I
THINK WE HAVE A CASE.
A CASE ?
AH.
YE
IAL
YOU WERE DENIED YOUR
RIGHT TO A FAIR TR
E.
BY AN IMPARTIAL JUDG
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
WE COULD GO TO COURT
AND HAVE THE VERDICT
OVERTURNED ?
MY FRIEND,
.
YOU HAVE A REA
L SHOT AT GOING FREE
-
NOW LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT-
JUDGE KIBLER DID
NOT TAKE A BRIBE
IN HILL'S CASE ?
THAT IS CORRECT.
( Glynn )
HE DIDN'T ASK
FOR A BRIBE  ?
THIS IS ALSO CORRECT.
THEN WHAT EXACTLY ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT ?
S,
THE JUDGE WAS LENIENT WI
TH THOSE WHO DID GIVE BRIBE
SO HE MAY HAVE BEEN HARSH
WITH THOSE WHO DID NOT.
Y
LOOK, ALL WE ASK I
S FOR THE OPPORTUNIT
.
TO EXPLORE THE
MERITS OF THE CASE
WHAT OPPORTUNITIES
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ?
AND FOR HOW LONG ?
S.
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA NEED
MORE TIME FOR VISITATION
ER
I'M GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO THE LAWY
WHO ORIGINALLY REPRESENTED
AUGUSTUS AND ANYBODY
THAT OFFERED BRIBES,
THEIR LAWYERS,
THE PROSECUTION AT JUDGE
KIBLER'S TRIAL, Etc.
.
YOU'VE STAYED
PRETTY QUIET
THROUGH ALL THIS
KAREEM SAID HE'D
BE DOING THE TALKING.
I'D BE AN IDIOT NOT TO KEEP
MY FUCKING MOUTH SHUT.
YOU LYING.
I AIN'T.
,
CLIFFORD, I SAT NEXT TO YO
U THROUGH ALL THOSE HEARINGS
ALL THOSE DAYS OF THE TRIAL.
I GOT SO I COULD TELL
WHEN YOU WAS LYING.
H.
YOU GET THAT
LITTLE TWITC
I DO ?
R.
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
YOU'RE SUCH A SHIT LAWYE
.
AUGUSTUS, PLEASE
.
INSULTS DO U
S NO GOOD AT ALL
.
SURE AS HELL MAKE
ME FEEL BETTER
I DID THE BEST
I COULD FOR YOU.
IT.
YEAH, I KNOW. THAT'S
WHY I'M SAYING, YOU SH
CAN WE GET BACK TO
THE POINT, PLEASE ?
NOW YOU KNEW OTHERS
WERE GIVING BRIBES.
I HEARD STUFF IN
THE COURTHOUSE
HALLWAYS, THAT'S ALL.
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU JUMP,
YOU MOTHERFUCKER ?
CALL ME NAIVE.
I THOUGHT I'D GET
A NOT GUILTY
BASED ON THE STRENGTH
OF THE CASE.
N,
IF YOU KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING O
WHY NOT GO TO
THE STATE JUDICIAL
COMMISSION ?
COME ON, I GO TO THE
STATE COMMISSION ?
AND NOTHING HAPPENS,
EXCEPT THE NEXT TIME,
I'M PLEADING A CASE
IN FRONT OF KIBLER,
HE CUTS OFF MY BALLS.
?
WELL
MARILYN CRENSHAW,
THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT
ATTORNEY WHO
PROSECUTED KIBLER,
SHE WILL MEET
WITH US TOMORROW.
!
OH, COOL
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH,
THE LAWYERS WHO GAVE B
RIBES WON'T TAKE MY CALLS.
THE SECRETARIES SAY,
"I'LL GET BACK TO YOU".
I SAY, "YOU CAN'T
GET BACK TO ME".
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD
DO ? WE SHOULD CHECK
IF ANY OF THOSE THREE
MURDERERS ARE DOING
THEIR TIME IN OZ.
I DID,
THEY'RE NOT.
THEY'RE IN
DIFFERENT PRISONS.
SO WHAT
DO WE DO ?
E.
I'M GONNA WRITE TO
EACH ONE, BUT I DO
N'T EXPECT ANY RESPONS
SO WE'RE FUCKED ?
NO.
R.
GOOD THINGS DON'T
COME EASY, MY BROTHE
YEAH.
( guard )
COUNT... !
.
UNTIL TOMORROW
ASALAAM ALAIKUM,
BROTHER.
CE
WHEN YOU WERE
GATHERING EVIDEN
TO PROSECUTE
JUDGE KIBLER,
DID YOU EVER HEAR
AUGUSTUS HILL'S
NAME MENTIONED ?
NO.
IN REFERENCE TO THE THREE
MURDER CONVICTIONS THAT
KIBLER WAS LENIENT WITH,
DID YOU PERCEIVE ANY
SORT OF PATTERN ?
NO.
SO NOTHING ABOUT THESE
THREE MEN WAS CONSISTENT ?
THEY SHARE THE SAME
STYLE OF MURDER,
SAME LAWYER,
SAME SKIN TONE ?
L.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO TURN THIS
INTO SOMETHING RACIA
THAT IS NOT
MY INTENTION.
BULLSHIT !
THE ONLY ELEMENTS
THAT ARE SIMILAR
IN THESE MURDERS IS
THEY WERE MEN AND
THEY WERE GUILTY.
SO THE BRIBES
WERE RANDOM ?
YES.
WOULD YOU
TESTIFY TO THAT ?
I NEVER SAID THAT
I WOULD TESTIFY,
.
TRY TO COMPEL ME,
I'LL TAKE YOU TO COURT
WHY WOULD
YOU DO THAT ?
YOU'RE AN ASSISTANT
DISTRICT ATTORNEY,
SWORN TO SEEING
JUSTICE DONE.
NOW DOESN'T YOUR DEFINITION
OF JUSTICE EXTEND
TO MY CLIENT ?
YOUR CLIENT ?
PLEASE !
THE ONLY PLACE THAT
YOU ARE A LAWYER
IS IN YOUR
OWN HEAD.
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
STRUTTING AROUND,
THUMBING YOUR NOSE
AT THE SYSTEM,
THUMBING YOUR NOSE
AT EVERYTHING THAT
I BELIEVE IN.
IT'S NOT HIM THAT I
WON'T HELP, IT'S YOU.
YOU COULD
WIN THIS CASE.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME
FREE LEGAL ADVICE,
YOU KNOW
THAT WOMAN ?
WHY DO YOU ASK ?
.
YOU TWO SEEMED
AWFUL FAMILIAR
?
THAT'S NOT THE BITCH T
HAT PROSECUTED YOU, IS SHE
MARILYN AND I,
BEFORE I FOUND ALLAH...
WE WERE ENGAGED
TO BE MARRIED.
I NEED MORE ACCESS TO PHONES.
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET CALLS
AS WELL AS MAKE THEM.
WELL, WHY DON'T WE
JUST RUN A SWITCHBOARD
INTO YOUR POD ?
OH, ANSWER A LEGITIMATE
REQUEST WITH SARCASM.
LEGITIMATE REQUEST ?
YES.
SAID, YOU'RE AN
INMATE IN A MAXIMUM
SECURITY PRISON.
NOW IF I SAY
YES TO YOU,
WHAT'S TO STOP NEXT GUY FROM
ASKING FOR THE SAME THING ?
THESE ARE SPECIA
L CIRCUMSTANCES.
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
I HATE TO BREAK
THE NEWS TO YOU PAL,
BUT IN HERE,
YOU'RE NOBODY SPECIAL.
YOU DESERVE NO MORE
THAN THE NEXT MAN.
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT ?
IS THIS BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LIKE WHAT I SAID
ABOUT YOU
IN MY BOOK ?
NO, THIS IS ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU ALWAYS ASK FOR HELP
RN.
AND YOU'RE NEVER WILLING TO
DO ANYTHING FOR ME IN RETU
WHY DOES THERE HAVE TO BE
A TRADE, A NEGOTIATION ?
I THOUGHT THAT DOING
WHAT'S RIGHT WOULD
BE ENOUGH FOR YOU.
NO GO, HUH ?
MN.
OH, DA
OUT
YO, WHAT WAS THAT
YOU WERE SAYING AB
Y ?
NOTHING GO
OD COMING EAS
IT
LIFE IN PRISON
IS SOME TOUGH SH
TO WRAP YOUR
MIND AROUND.
BUT SEE, I DID LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE
IN THIS CUM HOLE,
I SETTLED IN,
I SETTLED DOWN.
BUT THEN WHEN YOU SAID
THE WORD "FREE" TO ME,
SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME
STIRRED, YOU KNOW ?
FREEDOM, I WANT
MY FREEDOM.
AND YOU SHALL
HAVE IT, MY BROTHER.
I SWEAR TO YOU
BY ALMIGHTY GOD,
LY,
EVERYTHING
THAT I HOLD HO
EE.
YOU WILL GO FR
THOSE FILES ARE
CONFIDENTIAL.
YEAH, WELL, I HAD THIS
NATURAL CURIOSITY
.
ABOUT MY
FELLOW MAN
WE GOT THE RESULTS BACK
FROM YOUR NEEDLE ASPIRATION.
DON'T DANCE DOCTOR,
JUST GIVE IT TO
ME STRAIGHT.
OKAY.
THE LUMP UNDER YOUR
NIPPLE IS A STAGE TWO
BREAST CARCINOMA.
.
UH-HUH
STAGE TWO MEANS THAT WE
CAUGHT IT RELATIVELY EARLY
SO YOUR CHANCES FOR
SURVIVAL ARE GOOD.
.
UH-HUH
THE NEXT STEP
IS SURGERY.
DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS ?
YOU'RE MARRIED,
RIGHT ?
O.
YEAH.
YEAH, ME, TO
YOU'D LIKE MY WIFE

DOES THE DOCTOR KNOW
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOU
SHE.
ER.
GIVE ME HER NA
ME, I'LL TALK TO H
WOULD YOU JUST
FUCKING RELAX ?
DON'T GET PISSY WITH ME.

I'M THE ONE WHO'
S THINKING ABOUT YOU
( O'Reily )
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
SINCE TO HIGH SCHOOL.
.
WE'D FUCK FOR DAYS
AND OUR FRIENDS,
THEY WERE AMAZED
.
'CAUSE SHANNON
NEVER GOT PREGNANT
,
SO ONE DAY BEFORE
WE GOT MARRIED
SHE DECIDED TO GET TESTED
AND WE FIND OUT THAT
ED,
HER TUBES OR
WHATEVER ARE BLOCK
S.
SO SHE CAN
'T HAVE ANY KID
.
I MARRIED HER ANYWAY..
.
'CAUSE I KNEW SH
E FELT LIKE SHIT
I KNEW THAT SHE DIDN'T
FEEL LIKE A WOMAN ANYMORE.
.
I GOTTA GO
NO, NO.
HEY.
BUT I CHEATED
ON HER,
A LOT.
OH MAN, I DON'T
WANT TO DIE.
IT'S OKAY.
WHAT'S NEXT ?
I HAVE SCHEDULED O'REILY
TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY
L.
TOMORROW AT
BENCHLEY MEMORIA
.
WE'LL NEED TRANSPORT
AND AN OFFICER, OR TWO
WHAT, YOU THINK O'REILY
WILL TRY TO ESCAPE ?
I'LL BE ASSISTING
DR. SOPHIE POWELL.
SHE'S THE TOP BREAST
CANCER SURGEON
IN THE STATE.
( Glynn )
THIS SOUNDS EXPENSIVE.
IT AIN'T GONNA COME CHEAP.
WILL OUR INSURANCE
COVER IT ?
NO, AND THE CLAIMS
ADJUSTER INSISTS O'REILY
HAVE A LUMPECTOMY.
THAT'S WHERE THEY
REMOVE THE TUMOR
T.
BUT NOT THE BREAST, RIGHT ?
RIGH
IF WE CAN SPARE THE BREAST
AND SAVE SOME MONEY,
WHY DO A MASTECTOMY ?
WELL, LUMPECTOMIES
AREN'T ALWAYS EFFECTIVE.
THEY OFTEN HAVE TO
BE FOLLOWED UP WITH
RADIATION OR CHEMO.
THEN THE PRISON'S
FOOTING THE BILL FOR
THIS WHOLE WING-DING ?
AND HOW MUCH
IS THAT ?
THE SURGEON, STAFF
AND EQUIPMENT,
IN ALL, $18,000.
WOW.
AND A LUMPECTOMY
COSTS WHAT ?
ABOUT HALF THAT.
.
WELL, GIVE HIM
THE LUMPECTOMY
A PATIENT SHOULD BE
ABLE TO CHOOSE HIS
OWN MEDICAL PROCEDURE.
NO, NOT AT THESE PRICES,
NOT IF HE'S A CON.
LOOK, RYAN O'REILY'S
GOING THROUGH ENOUGH SHIT
DEALING WITH BEING A MAN
AND HAVING BREAST CANCER.
HIS SURVIVAL DEPENDS
AS MUCH ON THE
POSITIVE OUTLOOK
AS IT DOES ON
THE SURGERY.
WE CAN DO AN AWFUL LOT
WITH THAT $18,000, GLORIA.
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND COLD,
BUT WHETHER O'REILY
LIVES ANOTHER TWO MONTHS
OR ANOTHER 20 YEARS
MEANS DICK TO ME.
LEO, THE BALL'S
IN YOUR COURT.
GIVE HIM THE
LUMPECTOMY.
NEXT ITEM.
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU DIE,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER ?
HEY, BRO.

Shirley Bellinger, who was
convicted for the murder
of her four-year-old
daughter,
was sentenced
to death today,
the first woman in this
state to be executed
since 1841.
She will receive
a lethal injection
next month at Oswald
State Penitentiary.
Bellinger's lawyer has
already filed an appeal
in Federal Court
and will hold a press
conference tomorrow.
Speaking from
the Capital,
Governor Devlin said
he supports the sentence
and would not consider
a stay of execution
if petitioned.
HOW COMFY.
( Augustus )
YO, IMAGINE BEING
REMEMBERED FOR 1,000 YEARS,
THE THINGS YOU DID
WHEN YOU WAS ALIVE,
REACHING ACROSS TIME
AND TOUCHING THE LIVES
.
OF PEOPLE NOT YET BORN
THAT'S SOME DREAM.
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
WRITE BOOKS,
START RELIGIONS,
FIND CURES,
RUN FOR PRESIDENT,
BUT ME,
I DON'T WANT TO
BE A GREAT MAN.
I DON'T CARE IF I'M
REMEMBERED FOR THE
NEXT 1,000 YEARS.
ALL I ASK,
IS IF WE PASS
ON THE STREET,
NOTICE ME.

Oz - Saison 1, Épisode 1
ROUTINE CARCERALE
Diffusion originale :
12 juillet 1997
Oz...
C'est le surnom du pénitencier
de haute sécurité d'Oswald.
<i>Oz est rétrograde.</i>
<i>Oz est le châtiment.
Pour punir un homme,</i>
<i>on le coupe des siens,
de lui-même.</i>
<i>On le boucle avec ses semblables.</i>
<i>A Oz, la vie est dure
pour les durs.</i>
Jamais tu frappes ?
J'ai vu les dossiers des nouveaux.
Je veux Tobias Beecher...
Miguel Alvarez...
Il est à l'hôpital.
Il a été poignardé.
Il s'en tirera ?
Apparemment.
Ferme-la, connard,
avant que je vienne te...
- Salut, patron.
- Salut, Mike.
Je veux Donald Groves.
Le prends pas mal, McManus,
mais t'as perdu la boule ?
C'est un sociopathe
sans le moindre remords.
Et alors ?
Il a tué et mangé ses parents.
Qu'espères-tu en faire ?
Un végétarien.
Ce genre de type ne comprend
que la punition pure et dure.
Leo, tu l'as dit toi-même.
On ne fait que recycler !
Hé, dirlo,
- faut qu'on parle.
- Plus tard.
Un détenu arrive,
on le laisse croupir et il ressort
avec l'envie de se venger.
Sans changements radicaux,
on n'enrayera jamais le processus.
Groves ne sortira d'ici
que pour brûler en enfer.
Dois-je m'adresser au-dessus ?
On m'a donne carte blanche
pour diriger le quartier 5.
- D'accord, prends Groves.
- Merci.
Et Paul Markstram.
Markstram est un petit dealer.
J'en ai assez comme ça.
C'est les deux ou rien.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ?
C'est mon cousin.
<i>Timmy McManus.</i>
Il a créé une unité expérimentale
au sein d'Oz.
Une nouvelle approche
du problème carcéral.
Certains l'appellent
Emerald City.
Pour moi,
c'est un camp de concentration.
A Emerald City, on a des règles.
Bien plus que dans le reste d'Oz.
Votre cellule est votre maison.
Gardez-la propre.
Impeccable.
Vous devrez faire
de l'exercice régulièrement,
assister aux cours,
aux programmes de désintoxication.
Vous travaillerez
dans une usine de la prison.
Vous vous plierez aux normes.
On vous dira quand dormir,
quand manger,
quand pisser.
Il est interdit de crier,
de se battre, de baiser.
Vous devrez suivre les règles,
apprendre l'autodiscipline.
Parce que si vous aviez eu
un tant soi peu d'autodiscipline,
vous ne seriez pas là.
Des questions ?
- Je peux aller aux WC ?
- Retiens-toi.
Vos parrains vous aideront
à vous habituer aux règles.
Je veux pas de leur parrains,
ni de leurs règles.
Ferme-la, Groves.
Je suis Bob Rebadow.
Enchanté.
Paul Markstram...
Jefferson Keane.
Tobias Beecher...
Dino Ortolani.
Je suis vraiment obligé ?
Ecrase, c'est ton tour.
Beecher ?
T'es pas italien.
T'es là pour quoi ?
T'as triché au golf ?
<i>Prisonnier matricule 97B412,
Tobias Beecher.</i>
<i>Condamné pour conduite en état
d'ivresse et homicide involontaire.</i>
<i>Peine : 15 ans.
Libérable sur parole dans 4 ans.</i>
<i>A Oz,</i>
<i>le maton vous boucle et se tire.</i>
<i>Les prédateurs
prennent alors le contrôle.</i>
<i>Mais à Em City,
les matons sont là 24h sur 24.</i>
<i>Il n'y a pas d'intimité.
On voit</i>
<i>tout ce que vous faites.</i>
<i>Il y a des yeux partout.
Les yeux de McManus.</i>
<i>Le châtiment cède le pas
à la rédemption.</i>
<i>Timmy espère tous nous sauver.
Des autres, de nous-mêmes,</i>
<i>du système qui nous a amenés là.</i>
<i>Seulement voilà...</i>
<i>on veut pas être sauvés.</i>
Salut, Dino. Ça va ?
Ecoute, je sais que je suis censé
être ton parrain,
mais entendons-nous bien :
j'en ai rien à foutre de toi.
Pas de problèmes, Dino.
Un bon conseil :
dégote-toi une arme.
Si quelqu'un essaie de te baiser,
bute-le.
Autre chose ?
Ne souris jamais.
Dino, téléphone.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
T'as une compagnie de téléphone ?
- MCI.
- Ton code ?
Salut, Ginny.
Comment ça va ?
Tu me manques.
Dégage !
Les gosses sont là ?
J'aurais juré voir cet enfoiré
dans ma cellule,
fouillant dans mes affaires.
Il tape dans mes clopes
et sort l'air de rien
en sifflotant.
Je l'envoie valser.
"Pousse-toi, connard !"
"C'est pas ma clope
que t'as au bec ?"
Il a pas le temps de répondre
que je me défoule sur lui !
Directs du gauche et du droit !
Coup de pied, uppercuts !
Je vais le tuer !
Il crie pitié !
"Prends ça pour ceux
qui m'ont bouclé !
"Prends ça pour ce foutu flic
qui m'a matraqué !
"Prends ça pour cet avocat
qui s'en tape de moi !
"Prends ça pour la pauvreté
qui a fait de moi un esclave !
"Enculé !
File-moi ces putains de clopes !
"C'est des Marlboro.
Je fume pas ça."
J'ai commandé du veau.
Un vrai régal.
Je peux m'asseoir ici ?
Pardon, il y a quelqu'un ici ?
Toi.
T'as raison.
T'as raison
A propos de quoi ?
Genevieve.
Elle veut divorcer. Elle déjeune
avec ton associé pour en parler.
D'où tu sais ça ?
Dieu me l'a dit.
Votre attention.
Conformément
aux directives
prenant effet à la fin du mois,
il sera interdit
de fumer à Oswald.
Du calme !
Quiconque en possession de tabac
sera accusé de contrebande
et placé en isolement cellulaire.
C'est tout.
Les uniformes des détenus
sont faits ici ?
Non, ils sont fabriqués à Taïwan.
Ça, c'est des habits qu'on vend.
A qui ?
A des mordus de hip ou de hop,
je sais pas trop.
Prends un rouleau et tire.
J'ai jamais bossé en usine.
Non que je trouve ça dévalorisant.
T'étais quoi ?
Avocat.
Je les déteste
presque autant que les flics.
A l'appel !
Et maintenant ?
Ils vont nous compter
et nous boucler, pour la nuit.
Il n'est que 17h.
A quelle heure ils éteignent ?
22h.
Et pendant ces 5 heures ?
On survit.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Ce sont mes affaires !
Tout ce que tu as m'appartient.
Pigé ?
A l'appel, messieurs.
Sors de là.
Je faisais connaissance
avec mon âme sœur.
Il y a quelque chose dans l'air.
Et c'est pas de l'amour.
Je vais pas te baiser, lopette.
Du moins...
pas ce soir.
Je peux m'asseoir ?
Vern Schillinger.
Je comprends.
J'ai vu Abedisi t'emmerder hier,
te piquer tes affaires.
Il m'a volé ma montre.
C'est nul. Il m'a fait
le même coup à mon arrivée.
Qu'as tu fait ?
J'ai demandé à McManus
de me changer de cellule.
- Il a accepté ?
- Bien sûr.
Mais ne parle pas d'Abedisi.
S'il a des ennuis, il te tuera.
Porte une armure.
Une armure ?
- Tu m'as balancé ?
- Recule.
A qui tu dis de reculer ?
A toi, négro.
Vas-y, fais-moi reculer.
Du calme.
Je suis en haut.
T'es pas juif, au moins ?
Moi, juif ?
Je déteste Barbra Streisand.
T'aimes mes tatouages ?
On t'en fera un.
Non, merci.
Si.
Je te marquerai moi-même.
On marque le bétail.
Le bétail...
C'est ce que t'es.
Mon bétail.
Parce que maintenant, Tobias,
ton cul m'appartient.
<i>Ils appellent ça le système pénal.
En fait, c'est le système pénis.</i>
<i>Sa grosseur, sa longueur,</i>
<i>Sa dureté... A Oz, tout tourne
autour de la taille de votre bite.</i>
<i>Et celui qui prétend le contraire
n'en a pas.</i>
Allez, Beecher, au petit-déj' !
Comme tu voudras.
A la fouille !
C'est pas à moi !
C'est un coup monté,
bordel !
Enfoiré !
Virez-moi ce minable.
Ce qu'il faut pas entendre !
Ce n'est pas avec quelques chiens
qu'on éliminera la drogue.
- Combattons la toxicomanie.
- Non, le trafic.
- Comment ?
- Une semaine de cellule.
Ils pourront rien faire circuler.
Je vois.
Tu veux tous les punis,
coupables ou pas ?
T'as une meilleure idée ?
Crois-moi, Leo,
McManus a pété les plombs.
Il envisage d'instaurer
une pause-silence. T'imagines ?
Une heure de silence quotidienne.
Pourquoi pas un atelier macramé ?
Tu ne m'as pas écouté, Healy.
Il faut les habituer à se taire,
car à leur sortie,
ils devront bosser en silence.
T'as sniffé ou quoi ?
Ces tarés iront jamais bosser
chez Microsoft !
Sortir d'Oz fait d'eux des caïds.
Je veux mettre fin
à ce genre de prestige.
Ils pourraient faire des études,
apprendre à lire.
Si vous avez fini,
je poursuis.
Point suivant :
l'interdiction de fumer.
Une connerie ! Tu espères
nous faire appliquer ça ?
Cette directive
a été proposée par le Comité,
votée par l'Assemblée,
signée par le Gouverneur.
- C'est un connard.
- Politiquement ou en général ?
Il veut durcir
la politique carcérale,
rétablir la peine de mort.
Il va déclencher une émeute.
Une émeute ?
Ce qui s'est passé au réfectoire
n'est qu'un début.
Tous les détenus fument.
Les Marlboro ne disparaîtront pas.
Elles circuleront sous le manteau.
Je dis qu'il faut appliquer
ces mesures, pas que je les aime.
Point suivant : Kareem Saïd.
Il arrive aujoud'hui.
Ça risque d'être explosif.
Pas seulement parce qu'il a fait
sauter l'entrepôt d'un Blanc.
Saïd se considère
comme un prisonnier politique.
En attendant le rejet
de ses pourvois,
on le traitera avec des gants.
Après, on le transférera.
<i>Prisonnier matricule 97S444.</i>
<i>Kareem Saïd alias Goodson Truman.</i>
<i>Condamné le 6 juin 97
pour incendie criminel.</i>
<i>Peine : 18 ans.
Libérable sur parole dans 5 ans.</i>
<i>A Em City,
on traite l'autre correctement.</i>
<i>On le traite avec respect.</i>
<i>Qu'arrive-t-il quand l'un de nous
ne respecte pas l'autre ?</i>
<i>La violence.</i>
<i>Alors, c'est pareil que dehors.</i>
<i>Ta célébrité ne te vaudra
aucun régime de faveur.</i>
<i>Tous mes prisonniers sont égaux.</i>
<i>La vie est mal faite !</i>
Je vais enfin connaitre l'égalité
et je ne pourrai pas en profiter !
Fais ton boulot,
tiens-toi tranquille,
et on s'entendra bien.
Sinon, tu seras transféré
et crois-moi, Kareem,
dans le reste d'Oz,
le respect est un mot inconnu.
Me voilà prévenu.
J'ai lu tes livres.
Tu as de l'influence
sur les autres.
Aide-moi à rendre leur séjour ici
plus profitable.
J'aimerais aider mes frères
à vivre pleinement.
Nous le désirons tous.
D'autres renseignements ?
C'est moi
qui vais vous renseigner.
Comment ça ?
78% des détenus d'Oswald
sont des hommes de couleur.
Les derniers chiffres recensaient
un gardien pour neuf détenus.
On peut prendre cette prison
quand on veut.
En effet.
Mais vous ne la garderez pas.
Ça reste à voir.
Tu veux les soulever ?
Je dis simplement
que désormais...
je dirige Oz.
Joue pas au con avec moi,
mon frère.
Gardiens !
<i>Il y a toujours à Oz</i>
<i>un courant sous-jacent de peur,</i>
<i>de violence,</i>
<i>de haine,</i>
<i>prêt à exploser.</i>
<i>Prisonnier matricule 96C382.
Dino Ortolani.</i>
<i>Condamné le 12 décembre 96
pour homicide volontaire</i>
<i>et agression à main armée.
Peine : perpétuité</i>
<i>sans possibilité
de conditionnelle.</i>
- Il faut qu'on parle.
- De quoi ?
- De sexe.
- Vous êtes insatiable, ma sœur.
Et vous, pas drôle.
Dino Ortolani a demandé
une visite conjugale.
Et alors ?
Ce serait la quatrième
depuis janvier.
Et alors ?
Il m'incombe de permettre
aux détenus et à leurs femmes...
Je vous parle !
De leur permettre
de faire crac-crac.
Et il vous incombe de me dire
si un détenu
en a gagné le droit.
4 fois en un an.
Plus que moi quand j'étais marié.
Ça explique votre divorce.
Six heures de visite conjugale.
Tant que ça ?
J'espère que ce n'est pas
un éjaculateur précoce.
- J'ai cru que tu t'étais évadé !
- Merci, petit.
Il a mangé sa mère.
Arrête ton char !
Il l'a tuée
et a fait cuire sa tête.
Avec des oignons.
Pas d'ail ?
- Son père était au congélo.
- Quel cinglé !
Ce pays tourne pas rond.
De mon temps,
on tuait pour le business.
On les bouffait pas !
- Les temps ont changé.
- Tu parles !
Les temps n'ont pas changé.
Rien ne change jamais.
Mes frères,
nous devons fonder notre vie
sur des principes différents,
sur de nouvelles priorités.
Nous devons raviver
notre sens inné de la pureté.
Le cœur et l'esprit doivent
être purifiés et libérés.
Cela signifie : pas de drogues...
pas d'alcool
et pas de cigarettes, mon frère.
Bien, mon frère !
Pas de gros mots
et pas de sexualité contre nature.
Toutes ces tentations
doivent être remplacées
par une discipline de fer
et un objectif bien précis.
Cela améliorera notre vie
dans cet enfer
et nos esprits seront régénérés.
On n'est pas des voyous.
On est un groupe d'hommes
originaires d'Afrique
et vivant en Amérique.
Nous sommes forts et fiers.
Nous sommes une entité,
une présence.
Nous sommes une force
avec laquelle il faut compter.
Nous sommes une voix
qui doit être entendue !
L'homme blanc
nous a peut-être asservis
avec ses lois.
Il nous a peut-être asservis
dans ses prisons.
Mais il n'a pas,
il ne peut pas
et ne pourra jamais
asservir l'essence même
de nos âmes immortelles.
T'entends ces conneries ?
Ce Saïd est une menace.
Dis à Scibetta
qu'on doit faire équipe.
J'ai pas de vélo.
Je suis pas ton messager.
Dis-lui toi-même.
Regarde.
On n'a plus à s'en faire.
A quoi tu joues ?
T'aimes être à genoux ?
Alors, viens me sucer.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Dégage !
T'interdis à mes gars de dealer ?
Te mêle pas de mes affaires.
T'en as envie ?
Vraiment envie ?
Te cogner ? Oui.
Nous croyons à la non-violence,
au respect du prochain.
Pas nous.
Je donnerais ma vie pour toi.
Va falloir.
Soit.
Mon frère,
frappe-moi.
Je te dis de me frapper.
Frappe.
Frappe-moi au visage, mon frère.
Plus fort !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Dispersez-vous !
T'es vraiment cinglé.
La paix soit avec toi.
- Quel jour on est ?
- Vendredi.
On dirait un lundi.
Devinette :
qui emménage à Oz demain ?
- Ton oncle Vinnie.
- Non, le FBI l'a eu.
Ryan O'Reilly.
- Arrête ton baratin.
- Mon baratin ?
Pourquoi j'irais inventer ça ?
Ils sont cinglés.
Ils savent ce qu'ils font.
Sois prudent.
Il sera pas à Em City,
mais avec les autres.
Je tuerai cet enfoiré !
Tu ne feras rien du tout.
Sauf
si je te le dis.
A l'appel !
<i>Je vis à Oz.</i>
<i>Je mourrai à Oz.</i>
<i>Comme la plupart d'entre nous.</i>
<i>Ce qu'on était ne compte pas.</i>
<i>Ce qu'on est ne compte pas.</i>
Ce qu'on deviendra...
ne compte pas.
Pas vrai ?
Comment ça va ?
Sale pédé !
Allez, lève-toi !
Je le laisserai pas faire.
T'es con ou quoi ?
Il y a des flics partout.
Qui est Keane ?
Moi. Pourquoi ?
O'Reilly.
Et alors ?
J'ai une petite affaire
à te confier.
Quel genre ?
Dino Ortolani.
Je le veux mort. Je paierai.
On tue pas
les mafiosi.
Miam-miam. C'est du plastoc !
T'as le bonjour de mon frère.
Il dit que tu peux m'aider.
Je suis là, pas vrai ?
Ouvrez la grille 57.
Refermez-la.
Ortolani... Les négros
ont peur d'y toucher.
Inutile de buter Ortolani.
Il se détruira tout seul.
Sale pédale !
Tous dans vos cellules !
Qui a fait ça à mon frère ?
Ne touche pas. Prie pour que
Keane arrive à temps à l'hôpital.
Sinon, ça te fera
un deuxième meurtre.
Docteur, j'ai pris perpétuité.
Un autre meurtre ne changera rien.
Vous avez des doigts de fée.
Ce baratin marchait dehors ?
Dehors,
j'étais fidèle à ma femme.
J'étais fidèle par choix.
Ici, j'ai pas le choix.
Si ?
Aucun choix, aucune chance.
Y a une prison pour femmes.
Pourquoi agiter vos nichons
devant 1400 mecs ?
J'en avais assez de draguer
dans les bars.
Mariée ?
Ça te regarde pas.
Comment peut-on laisser sa nana
bosser dans cet enfer ?
Il se soucie pas de vous ?
Si, énormément.
Vous êtes donc mariée.
Content ?
Très content, docteur.
Je suis au septième ciel.
Assieds-toi, Dino.
Ote-lui ses menottes.
T'es sûr ?
Certain. Détache-le,
je te dis !
Attends dehors.
Comment ça va ?
Tu t'en sors mieux que Keane.
Il est en réanimation.
- Il a commencé.
- Et t'as fini.
Je vais te dire une chose,
aussi clairement que possible.
Chaque détenu, chaque gardien,
soit te déteste,
soit a peur de toi.
Ou les deux.
Etre populaire,
Ça m'a jamais intéressé.
Et rester en vie ?
Ça t'intéresse pas ?
Continue et quelqu'un te tuera.
Et après ? De toute façon,
je suis destiné à crever ici.
Ferme-la et mets-moi au trou.
Tu sais pourquoi
je mêle les perpètes
aux autres ?
Pour qu'ils apprennent
à vivre ensemble.
Pas juste en vue de leur sortie.
Même si tu es là pour toujours,
même si tu dois mourir ici,
ta vie peut avoir un sens.
T'entends ça ?
Si t'es pas camé,
faut t'y mettre.
C'est ta troisième bagarre
pour une histoire homosexuelle.
Tu ne peux pas cogner
tous ceux qui te draguent.
Je suis censé faire quoi ?
Ce pédé se branlait devant moi.
- Ris-en.
- J'ai pas ce genre d'humour.
Comme punition, au lieu du trou,
tu t'occuperas des malades du sida.
Quoi ?
T'es taré ?
Je bosse en cuisine.
Service immunologie.
Fumier ! Dégage de mon bureau !
Nino, fais quelque chose.
Je veux pas bosser à l'hosto.
A qui tu crois parler ?
Je ferai rien du tout.
Crois-moi,
je toucherai pas ces pédés.
Ce sont des camés.
Je m'en fous.
Je veux pas le choper.
Sois prudent.
- Tu m'aideras pas ?
- Exact.
- Je dirige la cuisine !
- Baisse d'un ton.
C'est ce que j'essaie de te dire.
Tu dois apprendre à te maîtriser.
Les mafiosi font la loi
en prison. Comment ?
Avec ça.
Et ça.
On contrôle le trafic.
Mais toi, l'Arrabbiato,
tu veux tuer O'Reilly
et les pédés !
Tu dois réfléchir avant d'agir.
La vie n'est pas un pic à glace.
Va jouer les infirmières
quelque temps.
Va torcher des culs.
Torcher des culs...
J'emmerde McManus !
J'emmerde ces enculés !
A la bouffe, Sanchez.
J'ai pas faim.
Le Dr Nathan a dit
que tu devais bouffer.
T'es pire qu'un môme !
Ouvre le bec.
Je veux mourir.
Ouvre ton putain
de suçoir à bites !
Merci beaucoup !
Content de te voir, Gloria.
Merci de m'avoir collé Ortolani.
Outre qu'il me pelote sans arrêt,
c'est un vrai Hun avec les malades.
S'il déclenche une bagarre,
il ira ai trou. J'essaie
de faire boufer les choses.
C'est un violent criminel,
un tueur-né. Il ne changera pas.
Que proposes-tu ?
La trique ? La castration ?
Le Lorazepam.
Donnons-lui 4mg de Lorazepam.
Ça le rendra passif, il planera
et ne fera de mal à personne.
La chimie carcérale ?
T'as pas de couilles.
On dîne ensemble ?
Je suis mariée.
Séparée.
Alors ?
J'aurai des couilles.
Je l'espère.
Mon frère est à l'hosto,
avec des tubes dans le nez
à cause de ce Rital !
Quoi ?
Vous débattez du cas Ortolani ?
- Entre frères.
- Peu importe.
Que se passe-t-il ici ?
Ils me consolent
pour mon frère.
Ton frère est un pédé, Keane.
Il paraît que c'est héréditaire.
Toi aussi, t'es pédé ?
Suce-moi et tu verras.
T'as 2mn pour finir ton boulot.
Tous les autres, dehors !
Merci.
A nous deux, on y arrivera.
Johnny,
va au trou et tue-le.
Ortonali n'est pas au trou.
Il torche les malades du sida.
Je m'arrangerai pour que Post
soit affecté là-bas.
Quand le moment sera propice,
tu crèveras ce Rital pour nous.
Dino, mon ami...
je te cherchais.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
T'as amoché Billie Keane.
La Confrérie Aryenne te remercie.
Super.
- J'essaie de te réconforter.
- Pas besoin.
Va te faire foutre !
Toi-même !
Ce qui s'est passé avec ce pédé
n'a rien à voir avec toi,
sale facho.
Alors vire ton cul d'Aryen d'ici !
Connard de Rital !
<i>Rital, gringo, métèque, youpin,</i>
<i>niakoué, négro.
Des mots.</i>
<i>Les mots sont des armes.
Mais ça vaut pas un Mac 10.</i>
<i>Pour certains, la violence
est ce qu'il y a de pire ici.</i>
<i>Pour moi,</i>
<i>c'est l'ennui. Comment occuper
toutes ces journées mortelles ?</i>
<i>On a ce train-train censé
donner un sens à nos vies.</i>
Mais j'ai moins peur
d'être poignardé dans le dos
que de la routine.
Parce que la routine...
Mec, la routine, ça te tue.
Je veux voir ma fille.
Je veux voir ma fille !
T'es vraiment une plaie, Sanchez.
T'as une fille ?
Je te croyais pédé.
Les pédés ont des filles.
Faut croire.
Elle a trois ans.
J'ai un fils du même âge.
Tu veux...
des cigarettes ?
T'as pas le droit de fumer.
Je veux voir ma fille.
Où tu vas ? Je veux la voir.
Je suis là, mec.
Dis-moi...
comment t'as chopé le sida ?
J'adorais...
J'adorais l'héroïne.
J'avais l'impression
de changer de corps.
Je prenais mon pied.
Et toi ?
J'ai jamais aimé cette merde.
Mais j'en ai vendu beaucoup.
Peut-être...
Peut-être que j'ai eu
la mienne
par toi.
J'ai jamais dealé dans la rue.
N'empêche...
Ecoute, petit con,
moi, je vendais, c'est tout.
Fallait pas vour refiler
vos seringues !
Défense de fumer.
- Ortolani !
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Je vais bosser avec toi.
C'est cool, non ?
T'as une clope ?
Non, j'en ai plus.
Comment ça va ?
Tu sais,
c'est comme au lycée.
T'espères me changer
en m'envoyant là-bas ?
Ni tes bonnes intentions,
ni tes réformes,
ni tes remaniements
me feront changer.
On changera jamais.
Aucun de nous.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Dino Ortolani.
Annulez sa visite conjugale.
Dites-lui qu'à la place,
il verra sa famille au parloir.
Il est italien.
Ça fera au moins 100 personnes.
Juste sa femme et ses gosses.
Derrière la vitre.
Il pourra les voir,
mais pas les toucher.
Tim, vous devriez faire attention.
A quoi ?
A ne pas vous prendre pour Dieu
une fois de trop.
Si vous ne faites pas attention,
le vrai va se mettre en rogne.
Merci, mon ange. Allez jouer,
je dois parler avec papa.
Que s'est-il passé ?
D'où viennent ces bleus ?
J'ai glissé dans la douche.
Laisse-les jouer.
Ils se sentent à l'étroit.
Comment ça va, Ginny ?
La maison est si vide.
Ils te traitent bien ?
Bien sûr.
Mais l'argent
n'a aucune importance pour moi.
L'important, c'est les mômes.
Tu me manques.
Je te l'ai dit.
Refais ta vie.
Il n'en est pas question.
Tu dois refaire ta vie, Ginny.
Comme si on m'avait buté,
comme Mario et Jake.
Quoi ?
Tu veux
que je me trouve un type ?
Tu veux que je me remarie ?
Tu veux qu'un autre type
regarde tes gosses grandir ?
Qu'ils l'appellent papa ?
Je ne veux plus jamais
que tu les ramènes ici.
Un détenu attaque l'Etat en disant
que la fumée nuit à sa santé.
C'est ce putain d'endroit
qui nuit à la santé !
L'Etat flippe
et interdit de fumer en prison.
30 piges sans fumer, pas question !
Même au mitard, ce sera interdit.
Comme s'ils craignaient un cancer !
T'aimes t'écouter parler.
T'as déjà vu un œil cramer ?
Eteins ça.
Lève-toi de ma chaise.
A vos ordres.
Va t'occuper de Sanchez.
Qu'a-t-il fait ?
Il a eu un accident.
Change-le.
Je toucherai pas
cet enfoiré de malade.
Va falloir.
Pas question.
Ecoute,
il n'en a plus pour longtemps.
J'essaie d'alléger ses souffrances.
Evite-lui au moins de mourir
dans sa propre merde.
Merci.
Allez, Sanchez.
- Je veux mourir.
- Ton vœu va être exaucé.
S'il te plaît...
S'il te plaît quoi ?
Aide-moi.
A quoi ?
Aide-moi à mourir.
Regardez-moi qui est là !
Tu sais, Dino,
je t'en veux pas.
Ton boss t'avait dit de me tuer.
T'y peux rien si j'ai survécu.
Et si t'as réagi en gonzesse
en courant chez le procureur.
Je me battrai pas.
Ce serait dans mon dossier
et j'irais pas à Em City.
Tu viens à Em City ?
T'imagines ?
Toi et moi, macaroni,
côte à côte
pour le restant de nos jours.
Sauf si on me libère sur parole.
Viens et t'es mort.
Tu refuses de me recommander ?
Je t'emmerde !
Et merde !
Tu sais encaisser, hein ?
Quand il le faut.
Et t'as toutes les réponses.
Non, pas toutes.
Mais certaines.
Dommage que tu sois noir.
Il a tué un patient !
Je suis arrivée trop tard !
C'est un monstre !
Il faut l'arrêter !
<i>Les gens tuent pour rester en vie.</i>
<i>Ça vaut en prison comme dehors.</i>
<i>Mais je me demande pourquoi ici,
on lutte autant pour rester en vie.</i>
<i>Un homme est condamné à 100 ans.</i>
<i>Croit-il vraiment qu'en se tenant
à carreau, il va pouvoir sortir ?</i>
Le juge dit : perpétuité
sans possibilité de conditionnelle.
Sans possibilité.
Les perpètes !
Un jour, ils pigent
que c'est sans issue.
J'ai déjà vu ça arriver.
La quiétude envahit leur regard.
Comme s'ils voyaient une chose
que nous autres ne verrons jamais.
Ils découvrent une autre liberté.
Ils sont prêts à mourir.
Et ils font tout
pour devancer l'appel.

VISITES CONJUGALES
Diffusion originale :
14 juillet 1997
Baise est un mot obscčne.
Viol est un mot obscčne.
Femme est un mot obscčne.
L'amour aussi.
La baise est une malédiction.
L'amour aussi.
<i>Ça vaut pour les garçons
et les filles,</i>
<i>mais aussi pour les amis,
la famille.</i>
Qu'est-il arrivé ŕ Ortonali ?
Il a étouffé un malade.
Je l'ai mis au trou.
- Et les sédatifs ?
- Quoi ?
Le Dr Nathan
lui a donné 4 mg de Lorazepam.
Depuis quand
on drogue les détenus ?
Et alors ?
Tes gars l'avaient déjŕ
mis K.O.
La question est :
qui l'a brűlé vif ?
Les Latinos, pour venger Sanchez.
Tous le détestaient.
Noirs, Musulmans, Aryens,
tous voulaient sa mort.
Toi y compris.
Moi, personnellement ?
Toi ou tes gars.
Ceux qui gardaient le trou.
- Je t'emmerde !
- C'est ça.
L'ennemi n'est pas ici.
Lenny, tu mčneras l'enquęte.
Interroge-les tous.
Retrouve l'assassin d'Ortolani
avant Nino Scibetta.
Avant que le FBI s'en męle.
Avant qu'une émeute éclate.
Les négros ont tué Ortolani.
- Tu as des preuves ?
- Comme s'il vous en fallait !
L'un deux l'a dit devant toi ?
Non, mais qui d'autre
Ça pourrait ętre ?
Les Latinos.
Brűler, c'est pas leur truc.
Les nčgres, si.
Tu aurais pu le tuer.
Pour sűr.
On s'adorait pas, Dino et moi.
Mais quand je tue un homme,
c'est parce qu'il entrave
mes droits constitutionnels.
Pour protéger ce qui est ŕ moi.
Ce que Dieu m'a donné.
Les Siciliens sont pareils.
Les autres tueraient
pour des baskets
ou une putain de cigarette.
Ce sont des bętes.
Ça suffit ! Arrętez !
Il n'est pas sorti ?
Ni pour manger, ni pour se laver.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Il est malade ?
Lâche-nous une minute, OK ?
J'espčre que ça va passer.
Ton cul m'appartient.
Comme ça,
tu fuis la compagnie ?
S'adapter ŕ la prison
est toujours dur.
- Mais toi...
- Ils ont brűlé Ortolani.
Il était dur, fort.
Si un type comme lui...
Te dire que tu es en sécurité
serait un mensonge.
Tu dois ętre prudent,
respectueux.
Tu dois essayer
de te concentrer
sur le jour de ta sortie.
T'es marié.
T'as des gosses ?
Ta famille t'a rendu visite ?
Je n'ai pas revu Genevičve
depuis ma condamnation.
Et les gosses
depuis encore plus longtemps.
Appelle-la, dis-lui de venir.
D'abord seule,
pour qu'elle cerne les lieux.
Offrez-vous une soirée romantique
Une soirée romantique, ici ?
Comment ?
Va voir sśur Peter.
Nous y voilŕ.
Tobias Beecher.
Bien !
Vous ętes marié.
Plus d'un se dit marié pour faire
venir sa copine. Ça ne prend pas.
De temps en temps,
un type marié réussit ŕ m'avoir
en faisant passer une prostituée
pour sa femme. Ça marche une fois,
mais pas deux.
L'intéręt des visites conjugales
ne se résume pas au sexe.
Votre femme apporte ŕ manger,
elle vous fait la cuisine,
vous bavardez.
Vous ętes ŕ nouveau réunis.
Vous voyez ?
Remplissez ce formulaire.
Oů t'étais ?
Chez sśur Peter.
T'as vu la psy ?
Au sujet de tes cauchemars ?
De ma femme.
Une visite conjugale !
Sans ma permission ?
Quand vas-tu enfin comprendre ?
Tu m'appartiens.
C'est moi qui décide pour toi.
Compris ?
Alors, demande-moi.
Viens
me demander
si tu peux baiser ta femme.
Allez, demande.
Puis-je voir ma femme ?
Baiser ma femme.
- Baiser ma femme.
- Plus fort.
Et dis "s'il vous plaît, monsieur".
S'il vous plaît, monsieur,
puis-je baiser ma femme ?
Plus fort.
S'il vous plaît, monsieur,
puis-je baiser ma femme ?
Quand tu me le demandes comme ça,
je ne peux rien te refuser.
Je viens voir mon...
Tobias Beecher.
B-E-E-C-H-E-R.
OK. Votre panier et votre sac.
J'ai apporté ŕ manger.
Par ici, je vous prie.
Transportez-vous de la drogue,
des armes, des explosifs,
de l'alcool ?
Signez ceci.
Ici.
Si je transportais des explosifs,
pourquoi le dirais-je ?
On me dit de demander,
je demande.
Mettez votre sac dans le casier.
Quand vous aurez fini,
allez dans la salle 1.
Tu m'as tellement manqué.
Le dessin de Holly est resté
dans mon sac.
Avec leurs histoires d'explosifs,
je l'ai complčtement oublié.
Il représente notre maison,
avec Holly, Gary, le bébé et moi.
Elle a dessiné le chien deux fois
plus grand que tout le monde !
Tu n'es pas dessus.
Tu n'es pas sur le dessin.
Je me suis dit que je pourrais...
faire des spaghetti.
S'il te plaît,
serre-moi dans tes bras.
S'il te plaît.
Active, Beecher !
Reste lŕ.
Magne-toi, Beecher !
Comment c'était ?
Bien.
Bien ?
Une nuit torride
avec la femme que tu aimes
et tu ne trouves que ça ŕ dire ?
Tu as une famille adorable.
Je suis surpris
que tu m'aies caché ça.
Surpris et...
un peu peiné.
J'espčre que tu ne m'en veux pas
d'avoir fouillé sous ton matelas.
Ravissante.
Ma femme est morte.
Mais j'ai deux fils.
17 et 16 ans.
Ils sont sacrément beaux.
De purs Aryens.
Mes fils m'adorent.
Je suis leur idole
parce que je suis en prison
ŕ cause de mes idéaux.
Ils feraient n'importe quoi
pour moi.
Voler, mutiler...
tuer.
Si je leur disais
d'aller voir ta famille ?
Une petite visite amicale.
Qu'en dis-tu ?
Mes fils et ta femme.
Mes fils et ta fille.
Femme, gonzesse, lope, fiotte...
J'ignore d'oů ça vient,
mais si un mec est votre "prag",
c'est pour la vie.
Comme au temps
oů le divorce n'existait pas.
On restait mariés jusqu'ŕ la mort.
"Jusqu'ŕ ce que la mort
nous sépare."
Donald Groves...
Tu as tué et mangé tes parents.
J'ai mangé que maman.
Je gardais papa
pour Thanksgiving.
Quel sens de la fęte !
Que sais-tu du meurtre
de Dino Ortolani ?
On m'avait surpris ŕ la morgue.
Que faisais-tu lŕ-bas ?
Je regardais.
Ils t'ont mis au trou ?
Ta cellule jouxtait
celle d'Ortolani.
Tu n'as rien entendu ?
Pas un bruit.
Il n'a pas crié.
On le brűle vif
et il ne crie pas.
C'est fort.
Autre chose ?
Je les ai vus l'emmener.
On aurait dit un poulet...
passé ŕ la rôtissoire !
Sa chair était marron
et croustillante.
Il était appétissant.
Que dit-il ?
Que le contribuable
n'a pas ŕ casquer
pour nos extras.
Merci, Gouverneur Trouduc.
<i>Je vais donc soumettre
ŕ l'Assemblée</i>
<i>un projet de loi
qui économiserait ŕ cet Etat</i>
<i>3 millions de dollars par an.</i>
<i>Cette loi supprimerait
toutes les visites conjugales...</i>
- L'enfoiré !
- Je vais voir la sśur.
Ecoutez, les gars...
Si vous ne vous taisez pas,
j'accroche ma pancarte
"partie déjeuner".
Dans la file !
Bien. Merci.
faites passer ceci derričre vous.
Prenez un crayon
et remplissez les formulaires.
Les crayons s'appellent reviens.
Si vous vous battez avec
ou qu'il en manque un,
personne n'aura de visite.
Compris ?
Est-ce bien clair ?
Sinon, je peux répéter.
<i>Prisonnier matricule 95H522,
Augustus Hill.</i>
<i>Condamné le 6 novembre 95
pour détention de stupéfiants</i>
<i>et homicide involontaire.
Peine : perpétuité.</i>
<i>Libérable sur parole
dans 20 ans.</i>
J'y crois pas !
Je crčve d'envie
de voir ma femme.
Ça, au moins, t'en es capable.
Comment ça ?
La baise.
Tu crois
qu'un paralysé baise pas ?
Alors, tu peux baiser ?
Tu parles d'érection
ou de léchouilles ?
Je parle de va-et-vient,
de dedans dehors.
Marrant,
un négro qui bande
dans un fauteuil !
Certains sont plus ŕ plaindre.
Il leur faut une pompe, de la came
ou une piquouse dans la queue.
Le pire, c'est les prothčses.
On t'ouvre la bite et on te met
une tige en acier dedans
- pour la maintenir raide.
- Pitié !
Moi, je bande ŕ l'ancienne.
Mais je le sais pas.
- Tu sais pas quoi ?
- Je sais pas quand je bande.
Tu le sais pas ?
Je ressens rien. Je sais pas
quand je bande, quand je jouis.
Ma femme doit me le dire.
Tu te sens pas bander,
tu te sens pas décharger.
T'éprouves aucun plaisir.
Alors, pourquoi tu le fais ?
Pour elle.
On peut priver un homme
de plein de choses.
De cigarettes, de sport.
On peut lui prendre
sa liberté, ses jambes,
mais pas ses sentiments.
<i>Pas ses sentiments.</i>
<i>Si un homme aime une femme,</i>
<i>il la désire.
Il désire son corps.</i>
<i>Il veut qu'elle le désire.</i>
<i>Et on lui dit :</i>
<i>"Tu ne pourras plus jamais
lui faire l'amour,</i>
<i>"ni la toucher ainsi</i>
<i>"désormais.
C'est la derničre fois.</i>
<i>"La derničre fois</i>
<i>"de ta vie."</i>
<i>Si c'est pas
une punition cruelle...</i>
<i>je sais pas ce que c'est.</i>
J'enquęte
sur le meurtre d'Ortolani.
Je suis verni, hein ?
C'était ton chef en cuisine ?
Des accrochages ?
Il te donnait des ordres :
"Négro, fais ci, négro, fais ça"
et ça t'énervait pas ?
Il m'appelait pas négro.
Il a envoyé ton frčre ŕ l'hosto.
Il l'a quasiment battu ŕ mort.
Ortolani était une ordure, mec.
T'es marié, Jefferson ?
Quel rapport ?
Réponds.
Je suis pas marié.
T'as une nana dehors ?
Elle sait que t'es un menteur ?
Si j'apprends
que t'es męlé ŕ ça,
elle reverra jamais
ta gueule de négro.
Je leur dis quoi ?
Tu dis rien, Johnny. Rien.
Ecoutez-moi bien.
Je dirige la cuisine désormais.
Tout sera comme avant.
Tant qu'on saura pas pour Dino,
on vendra plus rien ŕ personne.
Je le brűlerai, lui aussi !
Ferme-la !
- J'ai pas peur des Ritals.
- Ferme-la !
Les flics veulent me voir
pour Ortolani.
Quoi ?
J'ai une visite de Mavis.
Quoi ?
Ma nana. Je l'ai appelée.
Je lui ai dit
qu'elle me manquait.
Elle a dit
qu'elle resterait dehors.
La vache !
Son corps me manquait.
Merde alors !
Mon salaud !
Prisonnier matricule 97K186.
Jefferson Keane.
Condamné le 14 mai 1997
pour deux homicides volontaires.
Peine : réclusion ŕ perpétuité
sans possibilité de conditionnelle.
Je veux me marier.
- A quelqu'un en particulier ?
- Oui, ma nana, Mavis.
Elle veut t'épouser
bien que tu aies pris perpétuité ?
Elle m'a l'air remarquable.
Elle l'est.
D'accord.
Je m'en occupe.
- Il n'en est pas question.
- Pourquoi ?
C'est une prison,
pas la chapelle Elvis.
- On a assez d'ennuis comme ça.
- Ça calmerait les tensions.
On y verrait
une récompense pour Keane.
Or, il n'a rien fait
pour en mériter une.
Ça pourrait l'aider ŕ changer.
Il a tué un coupe de sang-froid
le jour de leur mariage.
Ils lui avaient volé sa came.
- Ça justifie son crime ?
- Ça l'explique.
Tu aurais accepté
s'il les avait tués
aprčs leur lune de miel ?
Je crois au caractčre saint
du mariage. C'est un lien sacré
entre un homme, une femme
et Dieu.
Les époux doivent vivre ensemble,
dormir dans le męme lit.
Keane et...
- Quel est son nom ?
- Mavis.
Ils ne peuvent pas.
Ce mariage serait une imposture.
Keane est ŕ Em City.
C'est ŕ moi de décider.
C'est vrai.
Mais je contrôle
l'entrée de la prison.
La future mariée
ne passera pas la porte.
Ils n'ont aucun indice
pour Ortolani. Alors, relax.
Et les mafiosi ?
Ils ont tout stoppé.
La came, les paris, la contrebande.
Les choses bougeront pas avant
que Scibetta ait ce qu'il veut.
J'ai parlé au directeur.
Il refuse que tu te maries.
Il changera peut-ętre d'avis,
mais il faut mettre
ce projet en veilleuse.
- Impossible.
- Pourquoi ?
Je la perdrais.
Si elle t'aime vraiment...
Tu m'avais promis.
T'es revenu sur ta parole.
Un type sans parole
n'est qu'une merde.
Une merde !
Je suis content
que tu viennes me voir.
Je l'aime tellement !
J'en suis convaincu.
Mais ton désir de l'épouser
ne doit pas venir de ton ego,
de la jalousie, de la peur
que, ne pouvant l'avoir,
un autre homme l'ait.
Si tu l'aimes,
tu ne dois pas l'empęcher
de vivre pleinement sa vie.
Jamais je lui ferais ça.
Tu m'as dit
pourquoi tu aimais Mavis.
Mais comment sais-tu
qu'elle t'aime ?
Grâce ŕ des détails.
A mon procčs, par exemple,
elle était lŕ chaque jour.
Le simple fait de la voir
rendait tout plus facile.
Et son visage, son sourire,
c'est comme...
Je sais pas parler comme toi.
Je veux que tu plaides ma cause.
Je t'aurai ce que tu voudras.
- Tu n'as rien de ce que je veux.
- Tu refuses ?
Je crois que vous vous aimez.
Mais tu dois t'en remettre
ŕ la volonté d'Allah.
Ma nana est enceinte.
Je l'ai baisée.
Maintenant, Allah me baise !
J'ai décidé de laisser
Jefferson se marier.
Pourquoi ?
Kareem Saďd est venu me voir.
Pas si vite.
Je suis venu te voir
et tu m'as rembarré.
Saďd te dit Dieu sait quoi
et soudain, le soleil brille.
Que fais-tu de ma crédibilité
auprčs des détenus ?
Je devrais interdire ce mariage
au nom de ta crédibilité ?
Exact.
Combien de fois un type comme Saďd
nous demande une faveur ?
Je vois, c'est donnant, donnant.
Il nous aidera pour Ortolani
et la drogue.
Ça ne donnera rien.
Il fallait me dire que l'amie
de Keane était enceinte.
Je l'ignorais.
Il ne m'en a pas parlé.
Bonjour la crédibilité !
C'est complčtement débile !
Le directeur a été catégorique
quant au déroulement du mariage.
Et cette procuration ?
Toi, tu seras ici...
et ta fiancée,
ŕ l'église baptiste.
Vous échangerez vos vśux
en męme temps.
Chacun de vous aura ŕ ses côtés
quelqu'un représentant l'autre.
Mon pčre, vous trouvez pas ça
complčtement nul ?
<i>Je dépense dix cents
pour t'appeler</i>
<i>Tu me dis que tu m'appartiens
pour me rassurer</i>
<i>Imagine</i>
<i>comme le monde serait beau</i>
<i>On serait si heureux ensemble...</i>
Acceptez-vous de prendre
Jefferson Keane pour époux ?
Ta gueule !
En vertu de mes pouvoirs,
je vous déclare
mari et femme.
Embrasse la mariée !
Embrasse mon cul !
Félicitations, mec.
Pour le meilleur
et pour le pire.
Ça peut difficilement ętre pire !
Salut, mec.
T'as reçu une lettre de Mavis.
C'est la volonté d'Allah.
Tu fais quoi ce soir ?
Je me disais
qu'on pourrait dîner chez moi.
Comme ça, tu dors ŕ la prison ?
Crois-moi, ça me réjouit pas.
Je fais deux gardes par jour
et je vis loin.
- J'ai pas le temps de rentrer.
- Déménage.
J'en ai pas les moyens.
Je te remercie,
mais je ne peux pas.
Trop de travail ?
Tu sauveras le monde demain.
Męme Jésus dînait.
Et il a été trahi et crucifié.
Je préfčre ne pas relever.
Tu as une fille. Ça la gęne pas
que tu sois jamais lŕ ?
Pitié !
On vit avec ma mčre. Toutes deux
me font sans arręt des reproches.
Allez, viens.
Impossible, j'ai un rendez-vous.
Un rendez-vous ?
C'est si dur ŕ croire ?
Franchement, oui.
J'ai une bite, moi aussi.
Trouve un boulot plus prčs.
J'ai cherché, y a rien.
Tu crois que ça m'amuse
de m'occuper de ces ordures ?
J'ai pas le choix.
Je suis comme les détenus :
coincée.
Mc Manus, trouve-toi une femme.
J'en avais une.
C'était un cauchemar.
T'as enquęté sur moi ?
On dîne ensemble demain.
Entendu.
Bonne soirée.
Dieu a créé
des crépuscules flamboyants.
Dieu a créé des chevaux de course
ultrarapides.
Dieu a créé l'orange,
la pomme, les fraises.
Mais Sa plus grande création
est la chatte.
Je veux pas ętre cru,
mais gardez vos crépuscules,
vos chevaux et vos fruits
et donnez-moi des chattes.
Je demande pas grand-chose.
Juste une par jour.
Chaque jour.
Miguel Alvarez...
je suis le Pčre Makata,
l'aumônier de la prison.
Et merde !
Tu vas bientôt ętre pčre.
Ta compagne, Maritza, est détenue
ŕ la prison pour femmes de Parker.
On a été arrętés ensemble.
C'est mignon, non ?
Tu pourras le voir naître.
J'en ai rein ŕ foutre.
Tu sortiras sans doute dans 2 ans.
Tu voudras alors l'élever.
Exact.
C'est mon pčre.
Mon grand-pčre est aussi ici.
Alors, arrętez votre baratin.
Je vois.
Tu as eu une enfance malheureuse.
Mais dis-toi une chose :
tu es responsable
de cette nouvelle vie.
Tu es responsable.
Comme je suis responsable
de toi, de ton âme.
Alors, prépare-toi, Alvarez,
parce que je te lâcherai pas.
J'ai signé l'ordre
de transfert d'Alvarez
ŕ Em City.
Miguel Alvarez...
Encore un brillant exemple
de notre systčme pénal.
A peine arrivé, il est poignardé.
Son pčre et son grand-pčre
sont détenus ici.
Je sais.
Je devrais peut-ętre
leur parler de Miguel.
Il refuse d'assumer
sa future paternité.
Son grand-pčre,
Ricardo Alvarez, est en isolement.
Quant ŕ parler avec son pčre,
Eduardo...
- Ce sera dur.
- Pourquoi ?
Il est agressif ?
Il n'a pas de langue.
Seńor Alvarez...
- Je suis Ray Makata...
- Je sais qui vous ętes.
J'aimerais qu'on parle
de votre petit-fils.
Eh bien ?
Il est détenu ici.
Je sais.
Savez-vous aussi
qu'il va ętre pčre ?
Son amie, avec qui il a été arręté,
est ŕ la prison de Parker.
Il refuse d'assumer sa paternité.
Peut-ętre pouvez-vous m'aider.
Parce que je suis
son grand-pčre ?
Je ne l'ai jamais vu.
Vous étiez un pčre minable.
Votre fils aussi. Ça doit cesser.
J'avais 18 ans
quand on m'a condamné.
Eduardo était bébé.
Quand je l'ai revu,
il avait 18 ans
et portait
le męme uniforme que moi.
Mon fils a commencé...
ŕ insulter tout le monde,
ŕ se moquer d'eux,
ŕ les menacer.
Il s'est mis
ŕ emmerder un Haďtien.
Un soir,
pendant qu'Eduardo dormait,
l'Haďtien
lui a arraché la langue.
Je sais, j'ai lu le rapport.
Alors, vous avez arraché
le cśur de l'Haďtien.
Vous ętes en train de me dire
que vous avez agi en bon pčre
en charcutant cet Haďtien ?
Si quelqu'un fait du mal ŕ Miguel,
vous ne pourrez pas intervenir.
Du moins, pas de cette façon.
Je vous demande de lui parler.
Pas pour vous, ni pour lui,
mais pour cet enfant
qui va naître.
Votre arričre-petit-enfant.
Quoi ?
Approche.
Qui t'es ?
Approche !
Je suis lŕ.
Alors ?
Tu sais qui je suis ?
Le sexe vous bousille.
Un spermato percute un ovule
et bam, vous voilŕ lié ŕ ces gens,
ces étrangers qui vous refilent
leurs yeux, leur nez,
ou une cellule vous poussant
ŕ boire ou ŕ vous camer,
męme si vous voulez pas.
Męme si ça vous tue.
Les gčnes sont comme
les fers des détenus.
Ils nous empęchent
de nous mouvoir librement.
Pour pouvoir s'en libérer,
faut ętre ce putain d'Houdini !
Ortolani s'est suicidé.
Un suicide ?
Comment un homme attaché
pourrait-il s'immoler ?
C'est impossible.
Pourtant, il s'est suicidé.
Qu'en sais-tu ?
Dieu me l'a dit.
Dieu te l'a dit ?
Dieu vient parfois me voir.
Plus souvent que je voudrais.
Mais c'est Dieu.
Que puis-je dire ?
Que je suis sous la douche ?
Il le sait !
T'as vu un buisson ardent ?
Un genre de lumičre stroboscopique
un peut trop tapageuse ŕ mon goűt.
Dieu t'a parlé de suicide ?
Le gosse voulait mourir.
Consciemment ou pas,
il s'est arrangé pour ętre tué.
Dieu t'a dit qui l'a liquidé ?
Je m'en doutais.
Il m'a dit
de vous dire de dire ŕ Scibetta
de ne pas se venger.
Si tu le disais ŕ Scibetta ?
Ce n'est pas parce que je parle
ŕ Dieu que je suis fou.
Comment va ta mčre ?
Pas bien du tout, papa.
D'aprčs le docteur,
ses jours sont comptés.
Qui est ce docteur ?
Un spécialiste.
Le meilleur.
Il est juif ?
je ne sais pas.
Il s'appelle Bednarek.
Trouve un Juif.
Pleure pas.
A part ça ?
Dino sera enterré demain.
Comment réagissent ses parents ?
A ton avis ?
Paolo est résigné
et Maria crie vengeance.
Dis-lui qu'elle l'aura.
Tu connais la musique.
Prisonnier matricule 95S604.
Nino Scibetta.
Condamné le 12 décembre 95
pour avoir commandité 2 meurtres.
Peine : 120 ans.
Libérable sur parole dans 70 ans.
Vous pourrez voir
votre femme ŕ l'hôpital.
C'est trčs...
gentil ŕ vous.
Pardonnez mon cynisme,
mais pourquoi tant d'égards ?
Elle est trčs malade.
Vous avez le droit de...
Lui dire adieu ?
Que voulez-vous en échange ?
Votre patience.
Vous trouverez qui a tué Dino.
Vous le ferez
traduire en justice.
Vous vous moquez de moi.
Je suis un sale cynique.
Personne ne veut
d'émeute.
Exact.
j'aimerais voir ma femme.
Alors, c'est d'accord ?
Je sais que t'es censé
ętre mon parrain,
me tuyauter,
mais j'ai pas besoin d'aide.
T'es irlandais ?
Ça te gęne ?
Je suis pro-aryen.
Tu fais du bon boulot.
L'annonce de ton transfert
a excité notre curiosité.
Ça n'arrive pas souvent.
T'es pote avec ce maton ?
Je suis trčs apprécié.
T'as des amis.
Tu peux en avoir un de plus.
A plus.
Au fait,
qui était lŕ avant moi ?
Dino Ortolani.
M. Scibetta demande ŕ te voir.
Merci d'ętre venu.
Assieds-toi.
La mort de Dino m'a bouleversé.
J'espčre évidemment
découvrir qui l'a tué.
Surtout de cette façon atroce.
Il peut sortir ?
Vous vous haďssiez, Dino et toi.
Je ne l'ai pas tué.
Je ne t'accuse pas.
Dino est mort.
Rien ne peut le ressusciter.
Mais si tu m'aides
ŕ retrouver son assassin,
je te montrerai ma gratitude,
ma mansuétude
pour tes indiscrétions passées.
Croyez-moi,
j'ignore qui a tué Dino.
Et, sauf votre respect,
je peux pas dire
que ça m'attriste.
Mais votre amitié
me serait précieuse.
Si j'ai une piste,
- je vous informerai.
- Je n'en demande pas plus.
Il sait.
Scibetta lâchera pas prise.
Il découvrira que t'es męlé ŕ ça.
Il faut lui donner Post.
Ensuite, tout sera réglé.
Tu marches peut-ętre comme ça,
mais moi, je donne pas mes frčres.
Que proposes-tu ?
D'attendre
que ça se tasse.
Les Siciliens n'oublient jamais.
Les choses se tasseront pas.
O'Reilly est pote avec ce négro.
Ça veut rien dire.
- Tu veux parler ŕ Keane ?
- Pas encore.
Suggčre ŕ Burruano
d'enquęter du côté d'O'Reilly.
- C'est une pute.
- A d'autres !
C'est une pute, je te dis.
Tu me fais marcher !
Saint-Pauli est
le quartier chaud d'Hambourg.
Que crois-tu qu'une fille
de Saint-Pauli fasse le soir ?
Moi qui croyais
lui avoir tapé dans l'śil !
- T'as une clope ?
- Bien sűr.
Cette interdiction de fumer,
quelle connerie !
Voilŕ ce qu'on sait
sur le meurtre d'Ortolani.
Keane et ses gars l'ont tué.
Vraiment ?
J'ignore lequel
a allumé l'allumette mais...
Ça se tient. Ortolani a envoyé
le frčre de Keane ŕ l'hosto.
Mais je me demandais
qui avait permis ŕ l'assassin
d'accéder au trou.
Il fallait que ce salaud
ait de sacrées relations.
Deux matons étaient de garde.
Les négros ont pu en acheter un.
Un détenu a tout arrangé.
A présent, je sais qui.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Celui qui avait assez de relations
pour ętre transféré ŕ Em City.
Celui sur qui Ortolani a tiré.
Toi.
Moi ?
- Tu veux rire ?
- Un jour ou l'autre,
je trouverai l'assassin de Dino
et il se mettra ŕ table.
Et le seul nom
que ce négro me donnera
sera celui de ce petit Blanc.
Un conseil : balance-le maintenant
ou fais-le vite taire.
Merci d'ętre passé.
Je sais qui a tué Dino.
Que veux-tu ?
Le 10 noir sur le valet.
Je suis désolé, Nino.
Elle était malade.
Depuis un an.
Un cancer.
C'était prévisible.
Il n'empęche...
Je peux faire quelque chose ?
Merci pour votre sollicitude.
J'aimerais rester seul un moment.
Bien sűr.
Je suis ŕ votre disposition.
Désolé pour Ange, patron.
C'était la bonté męme.
La patience męme.
Je ne suis pas facile ŕ vivre.
Ça, je le sais.
Je veux qu'elle ait
des obsčques fastueuses.
Je veux un cercueil
avec des poignées en or
et du velours rouge dedans.
Et pour la veillée,
des lys de chaque côté d'elle.
Elle en avait ŕ notre mariage.
Et pour porter le cercueil,
son acteur favori.
- Quel acteur ?
- Il est trčs connu.
Il jouait dans ce film
oů le truc explose.
Je vois.
Le grand type.
- Et Lena Horne.
- Pour porter le cercueil ?
Pour chanter.
Dis au cardinal
d'y aller mollo sur l'encens.
Cette odeur me donne la...
Je ne le demanderai qu'une fois.
Qui t'a payé pour tuer Dino ?
Je t'emmerde, sale Rital !
Avant de le tuer,
je l'ai enculé.
Tuez-le.
Commencez par la bite.
Vous allez faire quoi ?
Enfoirés de Ritals !
Je vous encule !
Le sexe et la mort.
Deux choses différentes,
mais semblables.
Pour atteindre le moment ultime,
le point culminant,
il faut perdre le contrôle...
de son corps,
de son âme...
<i>Un autre détenu d'Oswald</i>

Oz - Saison 1, Épisode 3
IN EXCELSIS
Diffusion originale :
21 juillet 1997
Au commencement,
Dieu n'était rien.
Alors, Il a créé des choses :
la poussière, le ciel, l'eau,
des trucs qui nagent, qui rampent,
qui marchent...
Dieu est devenu un caïd !
Quelques millions d'années après,
Il a donné vie à l'Homme.
Depuis, Il fait tout
pour nous la retirer.
Je suis la Résurrection
et la Vie.
Celui qui croit en moi,
même dans la mort,
continuera à vivre.
C'est le troisième meurtre
en deux semaines.
J'ai l'Administration sur le dos
et la presse à mes basques.
Le Gouverneur menace
d'envoyer le FBI.
Ma fille veut habiter avec son ami.
Sortez-moi de ce pétrin.
Post a tué Ortolani. Alors,
les mafieux ont liquidé Post.
la suite dépend de Keane.
- Il ripostera.
- Pas sûr.
J'ai décelé un changement
chez lui.
Peut-être parce qu'il s'est marié
ou que le crime ne l'amuse plus.
Si on lui tombe dessus,
on réveillera ses vieux instincts.
Ne répondons pas à la violence
par la violence.
Quand va-t-on tuer ces Ritals ?
Glynn va bientôt nous boucler.
T'es sûr que c'est eux ?
<i>Commencez par la bite.</i>
T'as qu'un mot à dire
- et ils sont morts.
- Tout va bien. Relax.
Tu t'en fous ?
Tu sais bien que non.
J'adorais Johnny.
On dirait pas.
Ces jours-ci, t'as l'air
à des années-lumière d'ici.
On tuera aussi l'enculé
qui a balancé Johnny.
<i>Je sais qui a tué Dino.</i>
Je sais qui l'a balancé.
Mais je le dirai pas.
Je tuerai ce salaud moi-même.
C'est toi, le chef.
Les mafiosi savent
que Johnny a tué Ortolani.
Mais savent-ils
sur l'ordre de qui ?
Surveille tes arrières
ou tu seras le suivant.
Laisse ces enculés venir.
<i>Un gang, c'est comme une religion.
Il y a des règles à suivre,</i>
<i>un chef à qui obéir.</i>
<i>Mais avant tout,
c'est une question d'amour.</i>
<i>"Aime ton prochain" devient</i>
<i>"Aime ton gang".</i>
<i>Mais si on cesse de croire
à ce qu'on prêche ?</i>
<i>On se rend compte
qu'il y a toujours un vide,</i>
<i>que le Dieu ou l'Amour
auquel on croyait</i>
<i>n'était qu'un hologramme.</i>
Mavis...
C'est moi, bébé.
Comment ça va ?
Tu faisais quoi ?
Vraiment ?
Tu portes quoi ?
Redis-le comme ça.
Ça m'excite.
C'est bon, bébé, continue.
C'est bon.
Quoi ? Tu veux une fessée ?
Burruano veut encore m'interroger.
Comme si je savais quelque chose !
Ils lui ont coupé la bite.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Dieu me l'a dit.
Salut, macaroni, ça gaze ?
Tu sais d'où vient
la tranche napolitaine ?
Non, mec, raconte.
A Harlem, au bon vieux temps,
deux Napolitains faisaient chier
le patron d'un bar clandestin.
On y jouait du Billie Holiday.
Les Ritals s'amènent dans le club
pour emmerder le frangin.
Mais un autre Black s'amène.
Et dehors, dans la ruelle,
sur fond de Billie Holiday,
il sort une lame et les taillade.
D'où la tranche napolitaine.
Tu veux la bite de Post
dans le cul ?
Viens me la mettre.
Mettez la brigade
en état d'alerte.
Dites au directeur
de m'appeler d'urgence.
On a un problème.
Ils le savent.
Je veux que la violence cesse.
Avant qu'il y ait un autre mort,
que le FBI envahisse les lieux
et qu'une émeute éclate.
Personne ne veut d'émeute, hein ?
Scibetta ?
Keane ?
Saïd ?
La violence ne résout rien.
Alors, passez le mot.
Si une autre bagarre éclate,
je bouclerai cette prison
à tel point
que vous ne verrez pas le jour
avant l'an 2000.
Vous avez pigé ?
- Alors ?
- Ils ont conclu un armistice.
Glynn n'ordonnera pas le bouclage.
C'est de la folie !
C'est de la folie !
<i>Pour s'intégrer, il faut jouer
le jeu, partager le pouvoir,</i>
<i>partager la douleur.</i>
C'est quoi ?
Sans doute des canoli.
- Putain !
- Quoi ?
La bite de Johnny ! Merde !
Putain de bordel de merde !
Les enculés !
Il y a des souffrances
qu'on ne partage pas.
Des souffrances
qui n'appartiennent qu'à vous.
<i>A vous seul.</i>
Pourquoi t'as fait ça ?
- Je m'ennuyais.
- Mon cul !
Depuis ton arrivée à Em City,
tu as toujours agi froidement,
calmé le jeu, et soudain,
tu fous le feu à ton matelas !
Ça te mènera droit au trou !
Pourquoi tu tiens tant
à y aller ?
Quelqu'un est après toi ?
J'ai jamais fui d'une bagarre.
Alors, quoi ?
J'ai envie d'être seul.
Tu vas l'être. Gardien !
Ton frère Billie
va sortir de l'hosto.
Je sais.
Il ne sera pas à Em City,
mais au bloc 3.
Une unité de pédales !
Emmène-le au mitard.
Keane...
tu devrais me faire confiance.
Salut, Keane.
Pourquoi ?
Un petit avertissement.
Que rien n'arrive à O'Reilly.
A genoux ! Pas un geste !
Regarde dans la bagnole.
Bouge pas.
<i>Prisonnier 917904,</i>
Ryan O'Reilly !
Condamné le 12 juillet 97
pour deux homicides involontaires,
atteinte à la sécurité publique,
détention de stupéfiants,
port d'arme illégal.
Révocation de sa conditionnelle !
Peine : réclusion à perpétuité !
Libérable sur parole
dans 12 ans !
Ce type crève d'envie d'une clope.
C'est à peine s'il fume pas
la bourre de son matelas !
Il vient me demander une clope.
Juste une pour tenir la nuit.
Il me supplie à genoux,
en chialant comme une gamine.
"S'il te plaît..."
C'était pitoyable. J'ai refusé.
Tu as refusé ?
En fait, j'ai menti.
J'ai dit que j'en avais plus.
Je crois pas qu'il m'ait cru.
Tu as refusé parce que...
Pour son bien.
Il fallait qu'il décroche.
Tu as fait ça par altruisme ?
Si on veut.
Alors, ce n'était pas un péché ?
Non, mon père.
Alors, que fais-tu là ?
Vous voulez la vérité ?
Bien sûr.
Je voulais m'en griller une.
<i>On dit que se confesser
est bon pour l'âme.</i>
Vous entrez dans un confessionnal
et vous racontez tout au prêtre.
Il ne peut rien répéter.
Si vous allez au commissariat
raconter ce que vous avez fait,
les flics alerteront
le procureur et la presse.
Envie de soulager votre conscience
sans courir de risques ?
Parlez-en à votre maman
ou à un prêtre !
Comment ça va, mec ?
T'as vu un peu ce bordel ?
Trois types tués en trois semaines.
C'est dingue.
T'es avocat, hein ?
J'ai été radié
après ma condamnation.
Pourquoi tu fais pas appel ?
Mon appel a été rejeté.
Pourquoi ?
Je roulais en état d'ivresse.
J'ai tué une gamine.
Ils ont voulu faire un exemple
et m'ont envoyé ici.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Mon avocat était nul à chier.
Il a complètement merdé.
Tu peux me dire
s'il y a moyen de faire appel ?
Je faisais du civil, pas du pénal.
Il faut que je sorte d'ici.
Ryan O'Reilly.
Tobias Beecher.
<i>Quand vous priez,
le reste du monde s'évanouit-il ?</i>
<i>Je n'ai jamais connu
ce coma divin.</i>
<i>Je peux dire un Pater
tout en pensant au déjeuner.</i>
<i>D'après certains,
si on refuse de voir en Jésus</i>
<i>notre Sauveur personnel,
on n'ira pas au Ciel.</i>
<i>Mais est-il sûr qu'en croyant
en Jésus, on sera sauvés ?</i>
<i>Ou bien Dieu, le farceur suprême,
nous laissera-t-il en plan ?</i>
Alors, bichon,
c'était bien, l'église ?
Tu te sens sanctifié et pur ?
Viens prendre une douche.
J'en ai déjà pris une.
Très bien. Quand je me serai occupé
de toi, tu devras en reprendre une.
Mon assistant a été libéré.
C'est le problème, ici.
On forme un assistant,
il fait du bon boulot et paf,
le comité de probation
décide de le libérer.
Et je me retrouve avec une pile
de rapports à taper.
Merci de votre offre.
L'usine, c'était pas mon truc.
Quand j'ai appris
que vous connaissiez Word,
j'ai loué le Seigneur à genoux.
Une chance qu'il vous ait entendue.
Moi, Il ne m'écoute pas.
Bien sûr que si.
Non, Il n'écoute pas.
Depuis que je suis à Oz,
j'ai prié plus
qu'avant mon examen d'avocat
ou que le jour où mon fils
a fait une chute en skate.
Soit Dieu devient dur d'oreille,
soit Il m'ignore.
La quantité de prières
ne veut rien dire.
Peut-être vous a-t-Il répondu,
mais pas comme vous l'espériez.
Dieu Tout-puissant qui a tout créé,
y compris le vide juridique.
Venez.
Voici votre bureau.
Il vaut ce qu'il vaut.
Que demandez-vous en priant ?
A sortir d'ici.
Pas besoin de Dieu pour ça.
Seulement un bon avocat.
J'ai passé ma vie
à bûcher sur la loi.
A la tourner, la retourner,
la contourner.
Quand j'en ai eu besoin pour moi,
le système
m'a claqué à la figure.
J'étais un bon avocat.
Vraiment.
J'étais beaucoup de choses.
Un mari, un père,
un fils, un frère, un ami.
Puis j'ai fait une erreur.
Une énorme erreur,
mais une seule.
Résultat...
Dieu m'a tout pris.
Ecoutez,
peut-être vous a-t-Il dépouillé
de votre moi superficiel
- docteur, avocat, chef indien -
pour que vous puissiez trouver
votre vrai moi à travers Lui.
C'est ce que j'ai essayé de faire,
mais Dieu n'est pas à Oz.
Si, Il est partout.
Il est en vous
en ce moment même, Tobias.
Geneviève a demandé le divorce.
Après avoir vu la croix gammée
sur mon derrière.
Les gosses et elle
vont vivre chez ses parents.
Si Dieu est en moi,
c'est une tumeur.
C'est quoi ?
Maman.
Un de ces foutus musulmans
prétendait
que Jésus était un nègre.
Il a même cité
la Bible
pour étayer ses conneries.
Jésus venait de Judée.
Il devait avoir la peau olivâtre.
Regarde.
Tu vois un nègre ?
Tu deviens bien arrogant.
Non, monsieur, je ne le suis pas.
Tu mérites une leçon.
Cire-moi les pompes.
Oui, monsieur.
Avec la langue.
Fils de pute !
Salut, l'avocat.
Où en est mon appel ?
- T'as pleuré ?
- Non.
Mais si.
Moi aussi, ça m'arrive.
Y a que les idiots
qui pleurent pas.
J'ai un remède contre le cafard.
Viens.
C'est quoi ?
Sois discret.
On va se défoncer.
A l'appel, messieurs !
Tous devant vos cellules !
A l'appel !
92M758.
93C472.
Puisse la route venir à toi,
le vent être toujours dans ton dos,
le soleil réchauffer ton visage
et la pluie arroser tes champs.
En attendant de te revoir,
puisse Dieu te tenir
dans le creux de Sa main.
Où t'étais, pédé ?
Nulle part, monsieur.
T'es défoncé ?
Oui, monsieur.
Je veux pas que tu te drogues,
que tu touches à une seringue, vu ?
Ecoute-moi, lopette.
Si je t'y prends à sniffer,
je te passe à tabac.
Faites ce que vous voulez de moi,
je m'en fous.
Parce que tu planes.
Parce que Dieu est partout.
Et Dieu me tient
dans le creux de Sa main.
"Louez Dieu et prenez les armes."
Quoi ?
Je me suis jamais confessé.
Tu n'es pas catholique.
Que fais-tu ici ?
On m'a encore chopé à la morgue.
Vous avez déjà vu un mec castré ?
Non, je n'en ai jamais vu.
C'est moche.
On m'a envoyé au trou.
Le maton m'a demandé si je voulais
vous voir, j'ai dit oui.
- Retournes-y.
- Attendez.
Je veux me convertir.
On ne devient pas catholique
pour sortir du trou.
J'ai beaucoup lu sur les religions.
La vôtre est vraiment top.
Le catholicisme, top ?
Toute cette histoire
de transsubstantiation mystique.
Exact.
L'eucharistie
est le corps du Christ.
Vous mangez sa chair
et buvez son sang.
Cette religion est faite pour moi.
<i>Et Dieu dit :
"Que la lumière soit" !</i>
<i>Et la lumière fut.</i>
<i>facile à dire
quand on est Dieu !</i>
<i>Pour nous, trouver la lumière
prend du temps.</i>
<i>Toute une vie.</i>
Jefferson,
voici ton nouveau coloc',
Kenny Wangler.
<i>Prisonnier matricule 97W566.</i>
Kenneth Wangler. Et ouais !
16 ans et jugé comme un adulte !
Condamné le 6 juillet 97
pour homicide volontaire !
Peine : 20 ans !
Libérable sur parole dans 6 ans.
Il m'a dit que tu recrutais.
Je veux être des vôtres.
J'y réfléchirai.
Y a pas besoin de réfléchir.
J'ai dit que j'y réfléchirais !
On aura besoin de renforts
si on veut se faire les mafieux.
Réfléchis bien.
<i>A Oz,</i>
les trucs abstraits sont parfois
plus réels que les trucs concrets.
Par exemple,
la peur, la haine, la solitude
sont plus réelles pour moi
qu'un surin.
Et l'âme
peut presque devenir
quelque chose de palpable.
Vous trouvez pas ça dingue ?
Attendre d'être dans ce trou à rat
pour enfin voir la face de Dieu !
M. Saïd...
Je voulais vous serrer la main.
Je vous ai vu à la télé
l'autre jour.
Je voulais serrer la main du type
qui dit des trucs aussi bien.
- Comment t'appelles-tu ?
- Kenny Wangler.
Kenny,
ce que je dis à voix haute,
tu le sais déjà.
Ces mots sont dans ton cœur.
Tu me comprends, petit frère ?
Accueillons notre petit frère.
On t'a volé.
On t'a volé quelque chose
de très précieux.
Quelque chose d'irremplaçable.
Quoi ?
Ton enfance, Kenny.
Ta jeunesse.
Le voleur t'a berné en te laissant
autre chose à la place :
la peur.
J'ai peur de rien !
On a tous peur de quelque chose.
J'avais peur de la pauvreté.
Mais maintenant,
vous avez plus peur ?
Si.
J'ai peur de Dieu, Kenny.
Et j'aime Dieu.
C'est ce qu'on appelle "takwa".
- Quoi ?
- Aucune importance.
Tu veux rentrer dans une bande ?
Je te veux dans ma bande.
Je veux que tu nous suives,
que tu suives notre exemple.
Tu deviendras vraiment un homme.
M. Woodson ? Bonjour.
Oui. Mavis est là ?
Elle est sortie ?
Où est-elle allée ?
Comment ça, vous ne savez pas ?
Me racontez pas d'histoires !
Vous êtes toujours sur son dos !
Oui, je vous traite de menteur
parce que vous me baratinez !
Dites-moi où est Mavis !
Des salopes... Toutes les femmes
sont des salopes.
Rien ne dit
que Mavis te trompe, mec.
Ce garçon n'a que 16 ans.
Il a pris 20 ans.
Mais il n'en fera peut-être que 6
et sera dehors à 22 ans.
Sa vie n'est pas terminée !
Tire-toi, Kenny.
- Quoi ?
- Je te dis de te tirer !
Viens, petit, on se casse.
Tu étouffes ta foi ?
Crains l'enfer, mon frère !
Crains l'enfer !
J'en ai pas fini avec toi.
Révérend...
J'ai peur.
J'ai peur de l'enfer.
Sauvez-moi.
Non...
Toi, sauve-moi.
Certains disent que trouver Dieu
est merveilleux.
C'est faux.
C'est dangereux. On passe sa vie
dans un monde d'hommes.
Mais quand on découvre enfin
Sa puissance, Sa grandeur,
les autres hommes disparaissent.
On est si obnubilés par Lui
qu'on les voit à peine.
On les perd de vue.
- Je suis sorti de l'hosto.
- Je vois ça.
Tu me prends pas dans tes bras ?
Merci de t'être occupé d'Ortolani.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
T'es pas content de me voir ?
Les choses ont changé.
J'ai changé.
Tu vas devoir changer aussi.
Comment ça ?
Arrête d'être une pédale !
Arrêter ? Je peux pas !
Je pourrai plus te protéger.
Tu seras plus mon frère.
Très bien.
Je te démolirai
si tu continues à être pédé !
Je croyais qu'on était
contre les pédés.
L'Islam rejette l'homosexualité.
Mais tu n'atteindras pas son cœur
par l'intimidation.
Tu dois lui ouvrir le tien,
lui montrer l'exemple,
comme je l'ai fait avec toi.
A travers l'amour.
Je comprends, mais c'est dur.
J'ai toujours tout réglé comme ça.
Personne ne te demande de changer
du jour au lendemain.
Nous devons tous combattre
le diable et ses tentations.
Mais c'est comme ça.
En ce moment même,
Allah est à tes côtés.
Et tu peux L'appeler.
Et Il viendra, mon frère.
Et Il te donnera la force.
C'est juste que...
j'ai si honte
de tout ce que j'ai fait avant.
C'est comme si j'avais besoin
d'aller voir tous ceux à qui
j'ai fait du mal pour m'excuser.
Alors, fais-le.
Transforme tes ennemis en amis.
Et mes amis ?
Il faut t'y préparer, mon frère.
Ta foi est une menace pour eux.
Tu devras les aimer d'autant plus.
Le programme de désintoxication
t'a vraiment réussi !
Merde au programme
de désintoxication !
Que fais-tu ici ?
Salut, Jefferson, ça gaze ?
Désormais,
je m'appelle Tizi Ouzou.
Ti-quoi ?
Approche, frère Tizi.
J'ai arrêté.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
On s'est plantés, mon frère.
De bout en bout.
Saïd lui a bousillé le cerveau !
Finissons-en avec la haine.
Aimons-nous les uns les autres.
Nous ne devons craindre que Dieu.
Me gonfle pas avec ces conneries !
T'es toujours avec nous ?
T'es toujours un frère ?
Je suis votre frère.
Dieu est notre...
Ferme-la, négro !
Je te demande
si t'es toujours un frère.
Comme ça ?
Pour faire ça ?
Alors, tire-toi !
C'est devenu une fiotte.
Ça suffit, négro.
File-moi ça !
Sale pédale !
Comme son frère !
Je viens de nettoyer,
bande de trouducs !
- Quoi de neuf, cousin ?
- Suis-moi.
Nous devons nous repentir
pour Ortolani et Johnny.
Tu me fais marcher
ou t'es défoncé ?
Je te donnerai pas.
Je dirai pas que t'as permis
à Johnny d'entrer au trou.
Quelle bonté !
Qu'est-ce que ça cache ?
Si je parle, t'es mort.
Je préfère que tu voies tes péchés
et que tu essaies de changer.
T'es défoncé.
M. Scibetta...
C'est Keane qui a fait tuer Dino.
Laissez-moi lui régler son compte.
Pourquoi ?
En signe de bonne foi.
- De bonne foi ?
- Oui.
D'accord.
Pourquoi vous le laissez faire ?
S'il veut se salir les mains,
c'est son problème.
Et puis comme ça,
les nègres le tueront.
Que veux-tu ?
Allez, Keane, suis-nous.
- Pourquoi ?
- Magne-toi !
Il vous a posé une question.
J'ai pas de comptes à vous rendre,
Votre Sainteté.
- Où m'emmenez-vous ?
- Ferme-la !
Quoi ?
Je vous ai rien fait.
Je veux pas me battre.
C'est parti.
Regarde !
Cet enfoiré a tué Martinez !
Bouclage général.
Bouclage !
Regagnez vos cellules !
Je suis très préoccupé
par les meurtres commis à Oswald
ces dernières semaines.
Bien que faisant
entièrement confiance
au directeur et à son personnel,
j'ai jugé nécessaire
de me rendre sur place.
C'est toujours un plaisir
d'échanger nos idées ensemble.
Veuillez nous excuser...
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ?
On vous a pas appris
à diriger une prison ?
Tous ces meurtres sont liés.
C'est une guerre raciale.
On essaie de l'enrayer.
Ce n'est pas brillant.
Vous ne nous aidez pas.
Quoi ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Tim Mc Manus.
Je dirige le bloc 5.
Emerald City.
La prison de l'avenir.
C'est vous qui provoquez
toutes ces tensions.
Comment ça ?
Le tabac,
les visites conjugales...
Vous les privez
des choses élémentaires.
Ce sont des criminels.
Le but est précisément
de les priver
des choses élémentaires.
Si les libéraux le comprenaient,
on n'en serait pas là.
La campagne est finie.
Descendez de votre tribune.
Quand vous me regardez,
que voyez-vous ?
Un homme.
Vous connaissez le Mont Olympe,
là où les dieux grecs vivaient ?
Il existait une hiérarchie
au sein des dieux.
Mercure était inférieur à Apollon
et Apollon
à Zeus.
Vous vous prenez pour un dieu.
Glynn
se prend pour un dieu supérieur.
Eh bien, moi...
je suis Zeus.
Je suis tout-puissant.
Je dois être obéi.
Sinon, ma foudre s'abattra.
Vous n'êtes pas Zeus.
Va faire un tour.
Très bien.
Merci.
Que voulez-vous ?
Primo, je veux
que ces meurtres cessent.
Secundo, je veux
que Keane soit jugé.
Je veux qu'il soit condamné
et exécuté.
Il étrennera le rétablissement
de la peine de mort.
Tertio, mettez fin au bouclage.
Quoi ?
Si le public l'apprend, il croira
qu'on a perdu le contrôle.
Ce bouclage prouve le contraire.
Je ne parle pas de ce qui est,
mais de ce que pense la masse.
Et si une émeute éclate ?
Songez à votre carrière politique.
Ne vous en faites pas pour moi.
Je suis Zeus, ne l'oubliez pas.
Le Gouverneur m'a appelé.
Ton ami, le sénateur Schreiner,
lui a reproché son ingérence à Oz.
Il faut arrêter ce fichu Napoléon.
Kate Schreiner en a les couilles.
Devlin va nous envoyer le FBI.
Ils feront mieux que Burruano.
C'est ma prison !
Je ne veux pas voir le FBI envahir
les lieux, emmerder mes détenus.
Et la dernière chose
dont j'ai besoin,
c'est que tu t'en mêles !
C'est ta faute, Mc Manus.
Je m'en souviendrai.
Bienvenue à Oswald.
Post est entré dans la cellule
d'Ortolani et l'a brûlé vif.
Les gardiens
étaient de mèche ?
Ortolani était attaché ici
quand on l'a retrouvé brûlé.
Tu lui as coupé la bite.
T'es le parrain.
Tu peux tout faire...
On a retrouvé Post ligoté ici,
son pénis dans la bouche.
Je ne comprends pas.
Comment expliques-tu l'absence
de gardiens dans le gymnase ?
La bagarre a eu lieu ici.
Keane a brisé le cou de Martinez.
Entrez.
- Jeremy Goldstein.
- Tim Mc Manus.
Merci de me consacrer du temps.
Je veux voir ces crimes élucidés.
Je n'en doute pas.
Cet endroit est fascinant.
On me traite de youpin à tout va.
Ça ne vous gêne pas
que je sois juif ?
Vous ne pensez pas
que j'ai tué Jésus ?
Je ne suis même pas sûr
qu'il soit mort.
Parfait.
Ortolani, lui, est bien mort.
Carbonisé par Post. Pensez-vous
qu'il l'a fait de lui-même ?
Post n'était pas un cerveau.
Quelqu'un lui en a donné l'ordre,
mais qui ?
Sans doute Jefferson Keane.
Keane...
Il a brisé le coup d'un Latino,
Julio Martinez. Pourquoi ?
Je l'ignore. Il n'ouvre plus
la bouche que pour prier.
Je l'ai constaté.
L'absence de gardes dans le gymnase
ne vous semble pas étrange ?
Tout aussi étrange que le fait
que Post ait pu accéder au trou.
Peut-on supposer
que les gardiens sont impliqués ?
C'est probable.
Et vous ?
Moi, quoi ?
Peut-on supposer
que vous êtes impliqué ?
Vous me soupçonnez ?
Je suis du FBI. Rien ne prouvant
votre innocence, vous êtes suspect.
Petit quizz :
citez les sept péchés capitaux.
Pensez à ce film avec Brad Pitt.
La luxure.
Tout le monde avait cette réponse.
La gourmandise... l'avarice...
La paresse, la colère, la jalousie,
ou, plus précisément, l'envie.
Et puis ?
Et puis ?
Je vais vous donner un indice.
Si, parce que vous avez la réponse,
vous vous croyez le meilleur,
alors, vous commettez ce péché.
<i>Prisonnier 97A413,</i>
Miguel Alvarez.
Condamné le 3 février 97
pour agression à main armée
et coups et blessures.
Peine : 15 ans.
Libérable sur parole
dans 2 ans.
Tu vas bientôt être père.
Ta petite amie, Maritza,
est détenue à la prison de Parker.
On a été arrêtés ensemble.
C'est mignon, hein ?
Tu pourras assister
à la naissance.
Il est beau gosse.
Quand tu baisais Maritza,
tu te regardais dans la glace ?
Allez vous faire foutre.
Quoi de neuf pour Keane ?
Comment ça ?
Il a brisé le cou de Julio.
Il faut le liquider.
- Il est au trou.
- Et alors ?
Post a tué Ortolani au trou.
Je me demande bien
comment il a fait.
Tu voulais me voir ?
Tu veux faire du business ?
Toujours.
On veut aller
dans la cellule de Keane.
Quel rapport avec moi ?
Y a des rumeurs.
De fausses rumeurs.
- T'es pas pote avec ces matons ?
- Je te suis pas.
Quand bien même,
ce serait trop risqué en ce moment.
Personne n'aidera personne.
L'hôpital a appelé.
Maritza va accoucher.
Merde !
- C'est mon fils.
- Félicitations.
Il est beau, hein ?
Il doit tenir de sa mère.
Je serais prêt à tout pour lui.
Même à mourir.
Tâche plutôt de rester en vie.
Il faut que tu appelles Maritza.
Mon père,
depuis que le bébé est né,
j'ai pas arrêté de me vanter
devant tout le monde,
de dire qu'il était beau
et tout le tralala.
Faut dire que c'est vraiment
le plus beau bébé au monde.
Alors,
maintenant, je me dis
que j'en ai peut-être trop fait.
Maritza m'a appelé ce matin
pour me dire
qu'il avait un problème de foie.
Il est toujours à l'hôpital.
Ils pensent qu'il va mourir.
Peut-être que Dieu a trouvé
que je me vantais trop
et qu'Il a décidé...
comme qui dirait...
de me punir.
Dieu ne fonctionne pas comme ça.
J'étais le plus beau du quartier.
J'arrêtais pas de dire
que j'étais le meilleur sportif,
que j'avais la plus belle caisse.
Ça a dû foutre Dieu en rogne.
Est-ce que vous pourriez
parler à Dieu pour moi ?
Lui dire que s'Il sauve mon bébé,
j'arrêterai de la ramener.
Pouvez-vous faire ça pour moi ?
Entendu.
Mais tu dois prier Dieu,
toi aussi.
Ne marchande pas.
Fais-le pour ton propre salut.
Je sais.
Mais si mon bébé meurt...
vous savez...
je sais pas ce que je ferai.
Je crois que j'en mourrai.
Tu dois prier Dieu
pour la santé de ton fils,
mais aussi pour qu'Il t'aide
à affronter le pire.
Maritza dit que le docteur dit
que c'est parce qu'on se camait
avant qu'elle soit enceinte.
Quand elle est tombée enceinte,
les gens nous disaient d'arrêter.
Maritza voulait rien entendre.
Je pensais
que rien pourrait m'arriver.
Priez pour moi.
Priez pour mon bébé.
Je le ferai.
Répète après moi :
Oh mon Dieu,
pardonne-moi de T'avoir offensé.
Je déteste tous mes péchés...
Ça suffira pas.
Si Dieu veut
une partie de moi-même...
<i>Qu'attend Dieu de nous ?</i>
<i>Pourquoi est-on là ?
On essaie de négocier avec Lui.</i>
<i>Mais Dieu est un putain de dur.
Pour obtenir ce qu'on veut,</i>
<i>on doit renoncer à ce qu'on a
de plus cher. Sinon...</i>
<i>ça L'intéresse pas.</i>
Agneau de Dieu
qui enlève le péché du monde,
prends pitié de nous.
Le corps du Christ.
Dieu sait qu'Il est parfait
et pas nous.
On le sera jamais
mais Il veut qu'on le soit.
Et Il nous punit si on l'est pas.
Dieu est le roi des gangsters,
le chef de gang suprême.
Pas vrai ?
Il nous impose Ses règles.
Malheur à qui désobéit.
Il a pas à nous parler directement
ni à nous expliquer pourquoi
Il fait ce qu'Il fait.
Ce négro est quelque part au ciel,
en train de boire un cappuccino,
peinard.
Il tient le monde entier
dans Ses mains.
Il tient le monde
par les couilles.
In Excelsis Deo
et tout le bordel.

PEINE CAPITALE
Saison 1, Episode 4
Je veux pas me battre !
<i>En Amérique, nous avons tous
des droits inaliénables.</i>
<i>Le droit de porter une arme,
de garder le silence.</i>
<i>Mais l'Etat a un droit suprême.
Celui de nous tuer.</i>
<i>Pressé par l'opinion, le Gouverneur
a rétabli la peine capitale.</i>
<i>Il a décidé que Jefferson Keane,</i>
<i>un homme qu'il ne connaît pas
et ne verra jamais,</i>
<i>devait être exécuté,</i>
<i>abattu comme un chien enragé.</i>
Le climat dans ce pays a changé.
Les gens en ont assez du crime.
Ils veulent du concret.
Même si on sait que les exécutions
n'influent pas sur la criminalité ?
Précisément.
Devant tant de meurtres gratuits,
la punition doit l'être aussi.
Keane sera le premier homme exécuté
par cet Etat depuis 34 ans.
Le premier car il a tué un détenu.
Le premier car il mérite de mourir.
C'est le premier
car il est noir et jeune.
Jamais ils n'exécuteraient
un vieillard blanc.
Vous me dites ça à moi ?
De grâce !
On sera assiégés de manifestants
hurlant des slogans,
et de contre-manifestants
leur hurlant après.
Déjà qu'on avait du mal
à se garer !
- Peu importent les manifs.
- Je vous préviens,
quand ils viendront,
je défilerai avec eux.
Pas question qu'un de mes employés
manifeste, une bougie à la main,
devant une caméra.
Et les libertés d'expression
et de réunion ?
Supprimées, elles aussi ?
le Gouverneur parle
d'amputer nos budgets.
Il est sérieux.
Votre poste risque de sauter.
C'est une menace ?
J'ai un travail, Leo.
Une vocation. Je peux enseigner
à l'école de la Cathédrale,
être missionnaire
à Pago Pago.
Ne manifestez pas.
Sinon ?
Vous serez virée.
Très bien.
Je vous écrirai de Pago Pago.
Et si Keane
avait pas tué Martinez ?
- Si c'était pas lui ?
- Il l'a tué.
Je sais,
mais s'il l'avait pas fait ?
Je me demande juste
ce qu'un type peut faire,
ce qu'il peut penser
quand il sait qu'il va mourir.
La seule différence avec toi, c'est
que lui connaît la date de sa mort.
L'Etat laissera à Keane
le choix du mode d'exécution.
Je prendrais la corde.
- Et l'injection ?
- Pour les fiottes.
Ils disent que c'est indolore.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils en savent ?
Personne n'a ressuscité
pour le dire.
Sœur Peter Marie a été virée.
Je sais.
J'étais son assistant.
Elle est contre la peine de mort.
- Comme moi.
- Moi aussi.
Tu as connu
le dernier homme exécuté ?
J'étais le dernier homme exécuté.
Cette panne t'a sauvé la vie ?
L'électricité
a sauté dans 5 Etats.
On ignore si cette panne m'a sauvé
ou si c'est moi qui l'ai provoquée.
Pas de séquelles ?
Si. C'est là que j'ai vu Dieu.
Il m'a serré la main et m'a dit :
"Joue du hautbois."
- Du hautbois ?
- Oui.
- Tu en joues ?
- De quoi ?
- Du hautbois.
- Non.
J'ai pas les lèvres pour.
Tu m'en files ?
Salut. Je croyais que Schillinger
t'avait interdit de te défoncer.
Je l'emmerde !
Et pour mon appel ?
Je faisais du civil, pas du pénal.
J'ai aucune chance ?
Vu le nombre
de témoins oculaires, non.
Tant pis
Au moins, j'irai pas
sur la chaise comme Keane.
Fallait laisser
les Latinos le tuer.
Comment ça ?
Ils voulaient le tuer ?
C'était un coup monté ?
T'occupe.
Dans ce cas,
on peut pas l'exécuter.
Ta gueule !
Ecrase ou tu seras le suivant !
Excusez-moi.
J'aimerais une copie
du procès de Jefferson Keane.
Amène-toi !
Le linge se lavera pas tout seul.
Avez-vous entendu parler
d'un coup monté contre Keane ?
Les matons
l'ont jeté dans l'arène.
Ils ont même fait une vidéo.
T'aimerais pas
la voir ?
Si on met la main dessus,
il ne sera pas exécuté.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Moins y a de négros,
mieux je me porte.
Quoi encore ?
Rien, monsieur.
N'oublie pas l'amidon.
Je vais dire à McManus
ce qui s'est passé au gymnase.
Tu ne peux pas.
Pourquoi ?
Ils te tueraient.
Qui ça ?
Bonne question.
Beecher, désolé de m'être emporté.
C'est rien.
Tu veux te défoncer ?
Pas maintenant.
Je veux garder les idées claires.
A plus.
Je devrais représenter Keane
et faire appel.
- Toi ?
- Je suis avocat.
L'Etat t'a radié.
L'Etat ne m'empêchera pas d'agir.
Je peux l'aider.
Il a tué en légitime défense.
Tu devrais demander à Keane
ce qui s'est passé.
Oui, mais comment accéder
au couloir de la mort ?
Je sais comment.
- On en veut à ma vie.
- Qui ça ?
Je ne peux pas le dire.
Vous devez me mettre
en cellule protégée.
On n'y va pas comme ça.
C'est réservé aux cas extrêmes.
C'en est un.
A l'avenir, je refuserai.
Je prends ce risque.
Qui m'appelle ?
Beecher. Tobias Beecher.
Il faut qu'on parle de ton procès.
- Tu n'as pas été coopératif.
- J'ai tué Martinez.
C'était un coup monté.
Ecoute,
Johnny Post a tué Dino Ortolani
sur mon ordre.
Les mafiosi le savent.
Ils veulent ma mort.
S'ils me tuent,
un de mes gars les tuera.
Et il se fera tuer à son tour.
Et ainsi de suite.
Ma mort peut mettre un terme à ça.
Pas forcément.
Ecoute, si je meurs,
j'irai peut-être au Ciel.
Si je retourne à Em City,
je redeviendrai comme avant.
Je perdrai ma foi et mon âme.
J'ai enfin trouvé la paix.
Ne m'enlèves pas ça.
Je ne suis pas responsable
de ton âme.
Mais étant avocat,
je le suis de la justice.
Je peux faire appel sans toi.
Ne fais pas ça.
Il le faut.
Il nous faut cette vidéo.
On y voit Keane avec les Latinos.
Jamais les matons ne la fileront.
Cette vidéo prouve leur complicité.
Fais ton possible, Bob.
Bien sûr.
Te voilà !
Que faisais-tu en isolement ?
J'avais besoin d'être un peu seul.
- Que fais-tu ?
- Je bosse sur l'appel d'O'Reilly.
Tu disais que c'était inutile.
Il m'a demandé d'y rejeter un œil.
Alors, je le fais.
Tu me baratines pas, j'espère ?
Si tu faisais une pause ?
Tu mijotes pas autre chose ?
"Argen contre l'Etat du Texas".
C'est sur un sursis à l'exécution.
Depuis quand
O'Reilly doit être exécuté ?
Bouffe.
Quoi ?
Bouffe cette page.
Joue pas au con avec moi !
Bouffe !
Rebadow !
Cette vidéo que tu recherches...
Elle n'existe pas.
- Vraiment ?
- Tu me crois pas ?
Certainement pas.
Quelques jours au trou
t'aideront à y voir clair.
T'as vu Keane,
malgré mon interdiction ?
Tu commences à avoir
des couilles, Beecher.
J'avais des couilles.
Il y a très, très longtemps.
J'espérais les récupérer
en sauvant Keane.
Mais l'avocat en moi
a été écartelé et pendu
jusqu'à ce que mort s'ensuive.
T'as du shit ?
Il te faut un truc plus fort.
Il te faut de l'héroïne.
Vous écrasez une mouche,
une fourmi,
ou un cafard
sans état d'âme.
Ça vous procure même
un sentiment de victoire.
Cette fourmi
gâchait le pique-nique !
Ce cafard rampait dans le buffet !
En supprimant
ces petits êtres répugnants,
vous rendez service à tous.
Mais pour chaque bête tuée,
d'autres apparaissent.
Plus grosses,
plus laides,
plus méchantes qu'avant.
En tant que Noir,
ce verdict me scandalise.
En tant que musulman,
je pense à l'âme de Tizi Ouzou.
Tizi Ouzou ?
Depuis sa conversion,
Keane se fait appeler ainsi.
- Tu veux être son prêtre ?
- Son imam.
Pas d'objections ?
Voilà le marché.
Tu peux aller parler à Keane,
mais seulement de spiritualité.
Si toi, lui, ou un des vôtres
fait du raffut,
je lui enverrai un rabbin.
<i>L'exécution approchant,</i>
<i>la tension monte à l'extérieur
du pénitencier d'Oswald</i>
<i>comme à l'intérieur, où le débat
sur la peine de mort fait rage.</i>
<i>Homicide, I.V.G., peine capitale,
tous sont des meurtres !</i>
<i>Une injection ?
Et notre bonne vieille chaise ?</i>
<i>Keane mourra demain
dans cette prison.</i>
<i>Outre les enjeux
moraux et politiques,</i>
<i>il y a aussi l'aspect humain.</i>
<i>Nous avons rencontré</i>
<i>le père du condamné
et la mère de la victime.</i>
<i>On inculque le bien à ses gosses
et on prie pour que ça marche.</i>
<i>Je veux le voir mort.</i>
<i>Je veux le voir sous terre,</i>
<i>mort.</i>
La sœur de Keane est malade.
Elle va mourir.
Il ne manquait plus que ça.
La vie est de plus en plus belle.
J'ai tout merdé depuis le début.
Ortolani est mort à cause de moi
et maintenant, c'est Keane.
Tu te sens responsable
de sa condamnation à mort ?
Timmy, je te le dis
le plus gentiment possible :
t'as vraiment une case en moins.
On va plus au théâtre ce soir ?
Docteur ! On a besoin de vous.
<i>On dit qu'il y a cinq phases
avant la mort :</i>
<i>le refus, la colère,
le marchandage,</i>
<i>la dépression,</i>
<i>et finalement, la résignation.</i>
Le moment où on se dit :
"Je vais mourir
et je peux rien y faire."
A Oz, on connait ça par cœur.
On sait tout de la résignation.
Regarde tes cheveux.
Laisse-moi te faire des tresses.
Pas la peine.
Ils seront si beaux
qu'ils voudront plus te tuer.
Allez, viens.
Si tu y tiens vraiment.
J'ai vu papa à la télé hier.
Il parlait de toi.
De notre famille.
Désolé de pas être comme tu veux.
J'aime être pédé.
Je t'aime.
Allah t'aime.
Mais pas papa.
Jefferson...
Pardon...
Tizi.
J'ai une mauvaise nouvelle.
Ta sœur Grace est à l'hôpital.
Une insuffisance rénale.
Elle mourra bientôt,
à moins de subir une greffe.
Mais les organes sont rares.
Qu'ils prennent un des miens.
J'en ai plus besoin.
- Arrange-toi, McManus.
- J'essaierai.
Tu dois pas essayer,
tu dois réussir !
Tu dois réussir !
Le Gouverneur a refusé le sursis.
Comment peut-on être aussi cruel ?
Il juge Keane trop dangereux.
Il a changé.
Sa conversion est peut-être bidon.
Parle-lui. Il est sincère.
On doit se battre.
Comment ?
Si on rend la chose publique,
Devlin sera furieux.
Il se prend pour Dieu.
On a besoin de l'aide du vrai.
Tu veux que j'appelle le Cardinal ?
Tim, Abgott est
encore plus conservateur
que Jesse Helms
et Bill Buckley réunis.
Il a même légitimé les tortures
de l'Inquisition.
Tu dois quand même l'appeler.
Appelle-le, toi.
Tu as peur ?
Bien sûr que non.
Pourquoi crois-tu
que je bosse ici ?
J'ai étudié à l'université
pontificale du Vatican.
J'étais dans les meilleurs.
J'étais le grand "espoir jaune"
du Cardinal.
Jusqu'à ce que je bosse pour lui.
Je posais trop de questions.
J'avais trop d'opinions.
Je l'ai défié
au lieu de le déifier.
Alors, Son Excellence a décidé
de me punir en m'envoyant à Oz.
Pour anéantir ma carrière.
La sœur de Jefferson va mourir
à cause de votre prise de bec ?
Je veux bien appeler.
Mais ça ne servira sans doute...
à rien.
Désolé de te déranger.
C'est à propos de la greffe ?
<i>Le Gouverneur, sous la pression
du Cheik Zahir Farrah</i>
<i>et du Cardinal Abgott, a accordé
un sursis d'un mois à Keane,</i>
<i>l'homme condamné pour le meurtre
d'un détenu à la prison d'Oswald.</i>
<i>Keane donnera un rein
à sa sœur malade.</i>
<i>Il sera opéré aujourd'hui.</i>
<i>le Gouverneur a précisé
que les frais</i>
<i>seraient à la charge
de la famille.</i>
<i>La clémence.</i>
Un mot pompeux pour dire pitié.
le Gouverneur
peut commuer une peine de mort.
Il peut décrocher son téléphone
et dire non.
<i>Mais pour moi, le seul acte
de clémence du Gouverneur</i>
<i>est de ne pas appeler.</i>
<i>Car la réclusion à perpétuité</i>
est mille fois pire que la mort.
La mort est une libération.
La mort est la vraie clémence.
- Dame.
- Merde !
Amène-toi.
C'est un ordre.
On doit parler.
Bouge pas les pions.
Pour qui tu me prends ?
- Je suis là.
- T'avais parié sur Détroit ?
- T'as perdu.
- Merde !
Faut raquer.
- Je paierai.
- Mon cul !
- Je t'assure.
- Maintenant.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que.
- Ça va pas ?
- J'aime pas ta gueule.
Tu t'es pas vu !
- Tu veux crever ?
- Essaie !
- Un problème ?
- Ouais, ça empeste...
l'ail.
Respire un grand coup et va-t'en.
Enculé de Rital !
T'as perdu.
Jamais quand ça compte.
Jefferson s'est fait piéger.
- Par qui ?
- Allons !
C'est pas sorcier à deviner.
Je savais que c'était les mafieux.
Scibetta l'a jeté dans l'arène ?
Non, pas Scibetta.
Je me suis renseigné.
D'Angelo a fait cavalier seul.
Ortolani étant mort, il espérait
une promotion mais le vieux traîne.
Il a décidé de liquider Jefferson
pour l'impressionner.
Enculé de Rital !
Jefferson va crever à cause de lui.
On doit exécuter D'Angelo !
Faites ce que vous avez à faire.
Mais avec tout le bordel actuel,
si vous butez D'Angelo,
Glynn nous bouclera pour de bon.
Tu proposes quoi ?
Vous bossez en cuisine.
D'angelo aussi.
Il pourrait avoir un accident.
Bonne idée.
Pourquoi tu tiens tant
à venger Jefferson ?
Il s'est occupé d'Ortolani.
J'ai une dette envers lui.
Je suis Carlton Auerbach.
Comme vous le savez, la sœur...
la sœur Peter Marie n'est pas là.
On m'a demandé de la remplacer.
On veut la sœur !
Elle n'est pas là.
Aujourd'hui...
Ferme ta gueule !
Aujourd'hui, nous parlerons
de la gestion de la colère.
Contrôler la bête
en nous...
M. Scibetta ?
Je peux entrer ?
Je suis au courant pour Joey.
Le tuyau à vapeur a explosé
et l'a assommé.
- Comment va-t-il ?
- Il est dans le coma.
Sans vouloir m'imposer,
s'il vous manque un gars...
Je me suis occupé de Keane.
Il va mourir
et on a les mains propres.
Un de mes meilleurs amis
à l'armée
s'appelait Donny O'Reilly.
Un Irlandais de Howard Beach.
Un petit dur qui se laissait faire
par personne, pas même le sergent
Il aimait les femmes
et les bateaux.
Il aimait les femmes
sur les bateaux.
Il aimait la vodka.
Il aimait les femmes buvant
de la vodka sur des bateaux.
Qui sait ?
On peut peut-être s'entendre.
Pauvre bougre.
Ça va ?
Comment va mon bébé ?
Pas très bien.
Ça ne s'améliore pas.
Les docteurs envisagent d'arrêter
le respirateur artificiel.
Le débrancher ?
Maritza est d'accord.
Maritza fait tout
ce qu'on lui dit.
- Ils tueront pas mon bébé !
- Ils ne le tueront pas.
S'ils débranchent les appareils,
il mourra de mort naturelle.
Je veux voir Maritza et le bébé.
Tu ne peux pas.
Ils ne t'autoriseront même pas
à appeler.
Un psychiatre va t'examiner.
Ils me croient fou ?
Tu t'es tailladé de partout.
C'était pour le bébé.
- Comment ça ?
- Je lui ai donné la vie.
J'en suis responsable.
Il est malade. Je sais pas
quoi faire. Je suis pas docteur !
Et te balafrer a servi à quoi ?
C'est entre Dieu et moi.
Dis ça au psy
et tu seras encore là à 90 ans.
Faut m'aider.
Faites-moi sortir d'ici.
Aidez-moi à voir mon bébé.
Dites-leur de pas le tuer.
Laissez-moi voir mon bébé !
Dites-leur de pas le tuer !
Je veux voir mon bébé !
J'ai amené Alvarez
sur la voie de la rédemption.
Je lui ai ouvert les yeux.
Ça le déchire intérieurement.
Le docteur dit qu'à ce stade,
maintenir le bébé en vie est cruel.
Je me renseigne. Quand je l'ai vu,
Alvarez n'a fait que pleurer.
Je veux juste
l'emmener à l'hôpital.
En voyant l'état du bébé,
il comprendra pourquoi
ils veulent le débrancher.
Je dois réfléchir.
On n'a pas le temps.
Ils le débranchent demain.
Demain ! Laissez tomber.
Je me passerai de sa permission.
Tu vas en prendre
la responsabilité ?
Parfaitement !
Je vous remercie de tout
ce que vous avez fait pour moi.
Surtout par rapport au bébé.
Je crois que parfois,
les choses sont comme ça.
On peut rien y faire.
Vous aviez raison.
Je me sens plus en paix
avec moi-même.
J'aurais jamais cru
que je pourrais
autant aimer un bébé.
J'avais jamais rien aimé
de ma vie.
C'est comme si tout
avait enfin un sens.
C'est important.
Comprendre qui on est...
Se connaître.
Maintenant, je sais.
J'en suis ravi.
C'est à vous que je le dois.
J'y vais.
Mon père...
Où était Dieu
quand mon fils est mort ?
Là où Il était
quand Son fils est mort.
Ça m'a l'air parfait.
Je me sens bien.
Le rein restant fonctionne bien.
Vous êtes en parfaite santé.
Je vais vous faire ramener au...
Couloir de la mort.
Vous pouvez le dire.
Keane... Tu as de la visite.
Salut, Papa.
Comment va Grace ?
Le docteur dit qu'elle récupère
plus vite que prévu.
Tu lui as donné un sacré rein !
Comment vas-tu ?
Je suis encore
un peu tourneboulé
par tout ce battage.
On me plante un micro sous le nez
dès que je sors.
On reçoit des tas de lettres
très gentilles.
Un type de l'Iowa a envoyé
100 dollars en liquide.
Ta tante Tilly voulait
que je les lui renvoie.
Tu l'as fait ?
Je suis pas si bête !
Rends-moi service.
Tout ce que tu voudras, fiston.
Va parler à Billie.
C'est devenu une pédale.
Tu sais pas ce que c'est.
T'imagines pas ce qu'on subit.
Toute cette solitude.
Parle-lui.
Je vous ai élevés
tous les trois seul.
Ta sœur va faire
quelque chose de sa vie.
Surtout après
ce que t'as fait pour elle.
Mais une fois dehors...
qu'est-ce que Billie sera ?
Ton fils.
Mon frère. Pour toujours.
La visite est finie.
Il est rare de quitter quelqu'un
en sachant qu'on ne le reverra pas.
On peut lui dire
ce qu'on a jamais osé dire
ou juste le serrer fort.
En espérant que le souvenir
de ce moment restera à jamais.
Ça va ?
Jefferson...
était mon aîné.
Il a toujours occupé
une place à part.
Un père...
ne devrait jamais voir
son fils mourir.
Je t'ai apporté du thé.
Du thé ? Pourquoi ?
C'est de la tisane.
T'en veux peut-être pas.
J'en avais plus. Merci.
Que fais-tu là, McManus ?
Que veux-tu ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je voulais juste...
Je voulais juste te dire
que je suis désolé pour toi.
Tu aimerais mon pardon ?
Eh bien,
quoi que tu te reproches,
je te pardonne.
Et les examens de Saïd ?
Ça fait du bien.
Rien à signaler pour l'instant.
J'attends l'IRM.
On dîne ensemble ce soir ?
- Je ne peux pas.
- Pourquoi ?
Je dois assister
à l'exécution de Keane.
Quoi ?
- Je te l'avais dit.
- Quoi ?
- Tu ne m'avais rien dit.
- Si.
Je te dis que non.
Jamais je n'aurais oublié ça,
crois-moi.
Et après ? Je vais juste
prescrire l'injection
et constater la mort,
pas lui faire l'intraveineuse !
Les médecins sont censés
maintenir les gens en vie,
pas les tuer.
- Tu vois ça comme un meurtre ?
- Je t'interdis.
- Quoi ?
- Je t'interdis de faire ça !
On n'est pas mariés. Tu n'as pas
à me dire ce que je dois faire.
Non, attends.
Ne me touche pas !
Tu devrais prendre des vacances.
A force d'être ici,
tu réagis comme eux.
Le Gouverneur est là ?
Non, je l'ai pas vu.
Un contre-manifestant a essayé
de frapper sœur Peter.
Elle va bien ?
Bien visé.
En plein dans les couilles.
Tu n'assisteras pas
à l'exécution ?
Et toi ?
Je déteste voir une fleur mourir,
alors un être humain...
L'expérience de Bambi m'a suffit.
Bambi ?
Mon ex adorait la chasse.
Il y allait avec ses potes.
Je lui ai demandé de m'emmener.
Il a regimbé puis il a cédé.
Je suis partie dans la forêt
avec ce gros fusil de chasse
et j'ai tiré sur un cerf.
En plein dans le mille.
Je suis allée vers lui,
je me suis penchée...
Il a levé les yeux vers moi.
Des yeux emplis de lumière.
Je me suis agenouillée
et j'ai murmuré : "Pardon".
Comme des piles se déchargeant,
la lueur dans ses yeux
a vacillé un instant
elle s'est éteinte.
Dès que j'entrais dans le bureau,
je voyais les yeux du cerf.
Je les époussetais.
A notre divorce,
j'ai demandé à garder sa tête.
Et je l'ai enterrée.
C'est ce que je ressens ce soir.
Comment ça ?
C'est comme si ma tête
était accrochée à un mur.
On dîne ensemble ?
Ça va ?
Ouais. Et toi ?
Pas trop mal
pour un homme qui va mourir.
C'est pour ce soir ?
Jeudi prochain.
Mais j'ai fait appel.
T'as vu ce vieux film
avec cette actrice...
Susan Hayward ?
Quel film ?
<i>Je veux vivre ! Elle attend
dans le couloir de la mort</i>
d'être électrocutée ou gazée,
je sais plus trop.
Son avocat a demandé
une commutation de peine.
Elle attend.
L'horloge fait tic-tac.
Elle attend l'appel du Gouverneur.
Et au dernier moment, il appelle.
Maintenant que j'y repense,
je crois qu'elle y passe.
J'ai des questions à te poser.
A qui lègues-tu tes affaires ?
A mon père.
Et l'argent sur ton compte ?
A mon frère et ma sœur.
Ta famille réclamera le corps ?
Qui sont tes témoins ?
Mon père et l'imam Saïd.
Tu es sûr
de vouloir y assister ?
Tizi et moi avons fait
une longue route ensemble.
Je ne lâcherai pas maintenant.
Allons-y.
La mort
est l'heure de vérité suprême.
Ainsi parle le prophète.
Loué soit-il.
La paix soit avec toi.
Ils ont pris mon koufief.
Je veux pas mourir sans.
Prends le mien.
3000 personnes sont actuellement
dans le couloir de la mort.
Le Congrès leur a refusé
l'accès aux tribunaux fédéraux
et a supprimé le financement
de leur frais d'appel.
Les Etats eux-mêmes écourtent
les procédures d'appel.
Il y a aujourd'hui
une exécution par semaine.
Le nombre d'exécutions
n'avait jamais été si élevé
depuis les années 50.
Une époque pourtant
très répressive.
Tu peux faire une déclaration.
Je veux que ma famille sache
que je l'aime.
Ce châtiment est plus dur
pour eux que pour moi.
Je regrette les trois meurtres
que j'ai commis.
J'aurais voulu que ma mort
puisse leur rendre la vie.
Mon séjour ici-bas
a été bien trop court.
Trop court pour me racheter.
je suis prêt à partir.
Loué soit Allah.
Justice a été faite.
L'Italien...
La Cour Suprême
a rejeté ton appel.
Renhquist est un pédé !
Ton exécution a été fixée
à demain.
Prisonnier matricule 97L641,
Richard L'Italien.
Condamné le 3 avril 97
pour homicide volontaire.
Peine : la mort.
Demain ?
J'avais rien de prévu.
Hé, dirlo,
j'ai un truc à vous dire.
Un truc
que j'ai jamais dit à personne.
J'ai étouffé Jennifer Miller.
Je sais.
C'est pour ça que tu vas mourir.
J'ai aussi étouffé Dorothy Payne.
Qui ?
Dorothy Payne.
Une serveuse de Council Bluffs,
dans l'Iowa.
Tu avoues un autre meurtre ?
Je le signalerai aux autorités.
Attendez !
J'ai aussi étouffé Ethel Peterson
et Gertrude Victor.
Et Mary Rapp.
Et Christina Trudell,
Eleanor Hugues,
Wilma Lomax, Lisa Masters,
Lorraine McCarthy,
Betty Case, Irene Martin,
Amelia Nugent,
Elizabeth Phelps,
Lucille Upton
et Esther Voight.
Pas mal, non ?
Richard L'Italien
a avoué avoir étouffé
39 jeunes femmes.
Si le gouverneur pouvait,
il l'exécuterait 39 fois !
Je dois y aller.
Ray.
Ecoute.
Comment peux-tu tolérer ça ?
Tu es contre la peine de mort.
Bien sûr. Mais je ne sais pas...
Si quelqu'un mérite de mourir,
c'est lui.
Le monde respirera peut-être mieux
après sa mort.
Mon rôle n'est pas de juger,
mais d'être à ses côtés.
Ma place est auprès de lui.
S'il a besoin de moi.
Priez pour lui, Marie.
C'est pour lui.
C'est pour eux tous.
Déjà mangé
des couilles de taureau ?
Jamais.
Ils en servent chaque année
au Bohemian Grove.
Un restaurant ?
Vous connaissez pas
le Bohemian Grove ?
C'est une retraite
à San Francisco.
Pour les courtiers, les banquiers,
les hommes politiques,
les intellectuels.
Vous le saviez pas ?
Remarquez, je vivais dans la baie.
C'est normal que je connaisse.
Quand j'étais môme,
je rêvais d'y aller.
C'aurait été génial.
Nager dans la rivière
avec un secrétaire d'Etat !
Pisser sur un séquoia
à côté de Donald Trump !
Ces types constituent l'élite.
Des hommes de pouvoir.
Des hommes !
Les femmes étaient interdites.
Mais la Cour Suprême les a obligés
à admettre les gonzesses.
Quelle connerie !
A partir de ce moment,
j'ai plus eu envie d'y aller.
Voues en auriez connu des biens.
Pas de celles que j'aime baiser.
Il y a une différence
entre baiser et tuer.
Ah bon ?
Vous avez déjà baisé ?
Alors, que savez-vous du sexe ?
Et que savez-vous...
du reste ?
Je sais juste que tu voulais
connaître des gens importants...
et qu'à la place,
tu es ici.
Je suis ici
parce que j'aime les femmes.
J'aime toutes les femmes
que je vois.
Les grandes, les minces,
les grosses. C'est vrai.
J'ai bossé dans un cirque un été.
J'ai baisé la naine
devant la femme-éléphant.
J'ai baisé des clodos
en Virginie.
J'ai enculé des rupines à Aspen.
J'ai baisé des thésardes,
des attardés mentales.
Une fois, j'ai même baisé
une cul-de-jatte.
Baiser est différent d'aimer.
Vous me rappelez ma psy
en maison de correction.
Elle prétendait
que je détestais les femmes.
Je lui ai montré !
Tu l'as baisée ?
Elle et sa fille.
Puis je les ai étouffées.
Si tu aimes tant les femmes,
pourquoi les tuer ?
Parce que !
Quand on aime une personne,
elle vous possède.
Je veux pas être possédé.
Je viens te donner l'absolution.
Désires-tu être absous ?
Et comment !
On m'a dit que je pouvais
choisir mon dernier repas.
J'ai pas pensé
aux couilles de taureau.
Je suis vraiment pas prêt.
D'abord, on leur donne
du penthotal de sodium,
un puissant anesthésique
utilisé en chirurgie.
Puis du bromure de pancumonium
qui paralyse le diaphragme.
Puis du chlorure de potassium
pour arrêter le cœur.
Jouez pas à ça, les enfants !
C'est fini.
Le Christ a été exécuté,
vous savez.
S'il ne l'avait pas été,
le monde serait
vraiment différent.
Et meilleur ?
Je n'ai pas dit ça.
Je veux revenir.
Sans supplier ?
Seulement si vous y tenez.
Je suis toujours
contre la peine de mort.
Même pour un monstre
comme l'Italien ?
"Tu ne tueras point."
La Bible est très claire.
On ne peut donner la mort
sous aucun prétexte.
Mais la Bible dit aussi :
"œil pour œil".
Ce qui signifie que si on tue,
on doit mourir.
Dieu dit une chose
et son contraire.
Lui aussi est peut-être
partagé sur la question.
Une seule chose est sûre : personne
ne réclamera le corps de l'Italien.
On le mettra
dans un cercueil en pin
avec un numéro d'identification
et on le jettera dans un trou
à Potter's Field.
Il y reposera.
Personne ne le pleurera.
Je le pleurerai.
Je sais.
C'est pour ça que je vous aime
et que votre retour me ravit.
Un type était
dans le couloir de la mort.
Il y était arrivé à 16 ans
et y avait croupi 16 autres années
pendant que magistrats
et avocats s'affrontaient.
Il tuait le temps
en peignant son mur,
sans jamais laisser personne
voir son œuvre.
A 32 ans, après avoir passé
plus de temps là
que chez sa mère,
tous ses appels furent épuisés.
Il allait mourir. Avant d'être
emmené pour la dernière fois,
il dévoila enfin son chef-d’œuvre.
Il se résumait à quelques mots.
"La mort est certaine,
pas la vie."
Le jour suivant,
les matons repeignirent le mur.
Paix.

VIVRE SAINEMENT
Saison 1, Episode 5
<i>Les inondations...</i>
<i>Il y en a souvent
dans l'Iowa ou le Missouri.</i>
<i>Les rivičres débordent.</i>
<i>Putain,
l'eau coule sans s'arręter.</i>
<i>Elle entraîne avec elle
des fermes, des villes.</i>
<i>Personne arrive ŕ l'en empęcher.</i>
<i>La vie des gens est anéantie.</i>
<i>Tout est détruit.</i>
<i>Et l'eau en a rien ŕ foutre !</i>
<i>Elle continue ŕ monter.</i>
<i>Année aprčs année, putain !</i>
<i>Je me demande
ce que les gens du Midwest</i>
ont dans le crâne !
J'ai vu un blaireau ŕ la télé.
Sa baraque avait été
détruite 4 fois.
Putain,
pourquoi il se casse pas ?
Pourquoi il va pas vivre
ailleurs ?
Il est comme nous, ŕ Oz ?
Ailleurs, ça existe pas.
Tes agents
font un boulot de merde.
Le but d'Emerald City,
c'est la surveillance constante.
Exact !
Mais Beecher a une croix gammée
sur le cul,
Alvarez a le visage lacéré
et les détenus se shootent
pendant les cours !
La came passe partout, Tim.
Si ça te va pas, remplace-moi.
Je le ferai pas, Diane.
<i>Pourquoi ?</i>
Parce qu'on couche ensemble ?
On est en retard.
Si tu étais ŕ l'heure,
j'aurais une attaque.
- De quoi on parle ?
- De drogue.
Mon sujet préféré.
Il y a de plus en plus
de drogue ici.
Dehors, les dealers risquent
des peines plus longues !
Ici, les types savent passer
de la came par tous les moyens.
Surtout Nino Scibetta.
L'avoir, ce serait le gros lot.
McManus, tu prétendais pouvoir
faire tomber Scibetta.
Avec du temps.
Hélas,
c'est ce qui nous manque.
Pour la drogue,
il y a deux pointures :
Nino Scibetta et Kareem Saďd.
- Les musulmans sont anti-drogue.
- Exactement.
Aide-nous ŕ arręter le flux.
C'est votre boulot.
Tu connais Oz comme ta poche,
tu peux nous tuyauter.
Ouais, et me faire descendre.
Je préfčre soigner
cette maladie ŕ ma façon.
C'est ŕ dire ?
En combattant la dépendance.
C'est ce que j'essaie de faire
dans mes séances.
Nous avons exactement
le męme but, Kareem.
Mais vu nos situations,
on ne peut pas s'entraider.
Et de plus en plus de détenus
sont touchés.
C'est tellement frustrant !
On croit
ŕ une puissance supérieure.
Que Sa volonté soit faite.
La Sienne ou la vôtre ?
Pour que Dieu nous aide,
faut lui donner un coup de pouce.
Et maintenant ?
Scibetta
bousille la vie des gens.
Je vais bousiller la sienne.
Pas de chance en ce moment, Nino !
Votre femme qui meurt,
Dino assassiné,
Joey D'angelo hors service.
Vos troupes s'amenuisent
et vieillissent.
Elles deviennent anémiques.
Blacks et Latinos prennent
la relčve, dehors et ici.
L'époque de la Mafia est finie.
Disons qu'ŕ votre âge,
vous devriez lever le pied.
J'ai un ami
ŕ la brigade des stup.
Parlez et il vous aidera.
M'aider ?
Et comment ?
Il va me protéger ?
Vous ętes un idiot, McManus.
Faites ce que vous voulez,
vous serez toujours un idiot.
Je changerai pas non plus.
Je peux pas renier ce que je suis.
Surtout pas pour vous.
Surtout pas pour un accord
ŕ la con avec les stup !
Vous avez fini ?
Pour le moment.
Votre attention ! Les détenus
suivant sont transférés.
A l'appel de votre nom,
prenez vos affaires
et mettez-vous en rang
derričre M. Vogelsang.
88P715,
Ottavino.
91J224,
Jambro.
85P661, Pellicano.
94R511,
Ricotta.
Ciao bello !
Du chocolat.
- Avec ou sans les amandes ?
- Les deux.
Ça marche.
Tu te démerdes bien
depuis l'accident de Joey.
Faut bien.
Exactement.
Pour nos démęlés,
maintenant que Jefferson Keane
est mort,
je suis pręt ŕ passer l'éponge.
Moi aussi.
Tu aimes les nichons ?
Comme tout le monde !
Les miens sont fermes et ronds.
Tu pourrais les sucer.
Il y a plein de mecs
qui voudraient.
Si tu me baises,
je te coupe la main.
Qu'est ce qu'il y a ?
L'avenir nous appartient,
mon pote.
Les nichons, c'est comme ça
qu'on appelle la came.
60% de la violence en prison
est due
aux nichons !
Certains paient pas
leurs dettes,
d'autres veulent contrôler
le trafic.
Le trafic !
En ce moment, ŕ Oz,
le trafic
est plutôt chargé !
Détenu matricule 94P442,
Ronald Pokelwaldt.
Condamné le 8 mars 94
pour incendie criminel.
Peine : 25 ans.
Conditionnelle
au bout de 10 ans.
Me touche pas !
Tu te planques ?
Fais gaffe.
Notre fric.
La semaine prochaine.
Tu as déjŕ dit ça.
J'y peux rien
si la poste a du retard !
Merde !
Allons-y.
Pas de fric, pas de nichons !
Soyez pręts pour demain,
les bamboulas.
Bamboulas ?
Ta gueule, Kenny !
Tu le laisses...
Casse-toi !
Je peux te parler ?
Ecoute, Nino,
je veux ętre lŕ quand la came
arrive. Ça se passe oů ?
Désolé, c'est un secret
de famille qu'on partage pas.
Si on s'associe,
on doit connaître les risques.
L'important,
c'est que ça marche !
Non, mec.
D'accord.
Comment ça marche ?
C'est pas par la cuisine,
sinon on l'aurait vu.
Les flics commencent toujours
par la cuisine.
On se sert de la poste.
Tiens.
Des chaussettes
envoyées par ma sśur.
Des Versace !
C'est un vieux truc.
Qui marche toujours.
Oů tu la coupes ?
Ici !
Ici ? Mais oů ?
Je te dirai que dalle !
Pas avant qu'on ait un peu plus
travaillé ensemble.
Ça marche.
J'ai pas envie de bosser
avec un macaroni !
Ça durera pas.
Scibetta faiblit,
il a perdu plein d'hommes.
Il suffit qu'on pige
comment ça marche
et on prend la relčve.
Mon offre tient toujours.
Je ferai tout pour vous aider.
D'accord, merci.
J'ai dit "d'accord" !
Je témoignerai contre Abedisi,
Markstram et Wangler.
On veut savoir
comment la came entre.
Tu as une idée ?
Non, je ne sais pas.
Tiens-moi au courant.
Je trouverai, et ŕ ce moment-lŕ,
je veux la peau d'Adebisi.
Ronnie !
Tu vas aux séances ?
Bien sűr.
La sśur dit que non.
J'irai aujourd'hui, promis.
Casse-toi, connard !
Tu paies jamais !
Je suis pas lŕ pour ça.
Comment la came de Markstram
entre ŕ Oz ?
Tu fais des études de marché,
maintenant ?
Non, je cherche
ŕ niquer ces nčgres.
Je sais pas comment ils font,
mais j'ai une idée.
Pose ton cul.
Nino, il faut qu'on parle.
Reste dehors.
C'est bon !
Je suis pas content
de l'incident de ce matin.
Explique-toi.
Mon opération marche
comme sur des roulettes.
Tout ŕ coup, il y a une fuite.
Un de tes gars a mouchardé ?
Impossible !
Tout est possible.
Tu veux bosser avec moi ?
Colmate la fuite.
Ne t'en fais pas.
On va s'en occuper.
Adebisi, reste lŕ.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Fais gaffe.
On a tous des secrets.
La plupart sont liés
ŕ nos dépendances,
nos obsessions.
Tu aimes trop le bourbon ?
Tu t'éclates avec des travelos ?
Faut que tu le fasses en douce.
T'es pas celui
que tu prétends ętre.
Ce qui compte le plus,
c'est nos secrets.
Et parfois...
ces secrets peuvent nous tuer.
Putain !
Décrochez-le.
Markstram
semblait pas suicidaire.
Il l'était pas.
- Désolé, Leo.
- Pourquoi ?
- C'était ton cousin.
- Pas du tout.
Il m'a dit que c'est pour ça
qu'il était lŕ.
C'est pas mon cousin,
c'est un agent des stup !
Tu mets un flic dans mon secteur
sans me prévenir ?
J'essaie de limiter le trafic de came.
Moins il y a de gens au courant,
mieux c'est.
Tu aurais dű me prévenir !
Et écouter tes sermons
sur les droits
des détenus ?
Markstram te donne
des tuyaux depuis longtemps.
Je voulais qu'il s'entende
avec les gangsters,
qu'il découvre leur réseau.
Mais on l'a balancé.
Qui ça ?
Sűrement un de ses collčgues
des stup.
Comment ?
Oui, monsieur.
Oui, je sais.
Au revoir.
Il demande le bouclage.
Devlin se bat
pour sa survie politique.
Il veut attirer l'attention
sur nous.
Je sais, mais c'est
ce que j'allais faire.
Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'on trouve
l'assassin de Markstram,
je verrouille Oz.
Qui aurait cru que Markstram
était un flic ?
C'est nul !
Qui d'autre s'est infiltré ?
N'importe qui.
Peut-ętre toi.
Ou toi.
Le suicide de Markstram
paraît louche.
Je m'en doutais.
C'était plutôt
pour alerter Glynn.
La taule va ętre bouclée.
Pas longtemps.
Ton réseau est foutu.
La poste ? On fait pas
vraiment comme ça.
C'était juste
pour vous tester.
Tu sauras jamais la vérité.
Pour en finir
avec le bouclage,
choisis un de tes gars
et fais-le trinquer
pour Markstram.
Keane et Markstram
te faisaient de l'ombre.
Je sais que tu es un type
qui comprend les choses.
Adebisi, ça finit par "i".
Tu serais pas italien ?
Scibetta finit par "a",
tu serais pas africain ?
Bouclage, messieurs !
Bouclage !
Tout de suite, Adebisi !
Bouclage, messieurs.
Putain, j'ai horreur de ça.
Pas parce que je suis coincé
dans cet aquarium,
mais ŕ cause du manque.
Tu as de la came, Groves ?
C'est mauvais.
Quelle connerie !
Tu devais ętre défoncé
pour bouffer ta mčre.
Elle désapprouvait la drogue.
Tu étais
un gentil petit garçon !
Tu obéissais ŕ ta maman.
J'aime tes cicatrices.
Je sais pourquoi
on nous a mis ensemble.
Il y a pas plus déglingué
que moi ici !
Tiens.
Je veux écrire ŕ personne.
Je veux me défoncer !
Lčche l'envers.
C'est du LSD liquide.
Dis donc, Groves,
tu donnes un nouveau sens
ŕ la philatélie !
Il y a pas que la came
qui rend accro.
Certains sont mordus
par le boulot,
d'autres par le sport.
Certains se shootent au jeu.
D'autres sont dingues de bouffe,
de vin, de cigares.
Il y en a pour qui c'est le cul.
Et c'est comme pour tout,
il en faut toujours plus.
Toujours plus, mec,
toujours plus !
Salut.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Markstram a été assassiné.
C'était un flic.
Je me sens responsable.
Diane, Harris a avoué le meurtre.
Tu as peut-ętre raison,
je fais un boulot de merde ici.
Tu sais quoi ?
J'ai une idée. Aprčs le boulot,
viens chez moi.
Je dois rentrer chez moi.
Ma mčre se plaint de DeeDee.
Je veux rencontrer ta fille.
On pourrait dîner
tous les trois en ville.
Et aprčs, j'en fais quoi ?
C'est pas le genre de boulot
oů on amčne sa fille.
Je t'aime, Diane.
Ah bon ?
Tu es censée répondre :
"Moi aussi, Tim."
La nuit oů Keane a été exécuté,
ce qu'on a fait
était une vraie connerie.
Je sais pas pourquoi.
Peut-ętre par solitude...
Pourquoi la raison compterait ?
Ça compte pas, mais...
Je suis venue
pour le dossier du nouveau.
Il s'appelle Scott Ross.
- Merde !
- Un problčme ?
Rien de dramatique.
<i>Détenu matricule 97R518,
Scott Ross.</i>
<i>Condamné le 4 juin 97
pour détention</i>
<i>de marijuana
destinée ŕ la revente.</i>
Troisičme condamnation.
Peine : perpétuité
sans conditionnelle.
Mon salaud !
Attends-moi ici.
Depuis quand tu travailles ici ?
Environ 6 mois.
C'est génial.
Pas du tout.
Je ręvais que tu me passes
les menottes.
Ecoute,
c'est pas
parce qu'on se connaît
que tu auras
un traitement de faveur.
J'adore que tu joues ce jeu.
je joue pas, Scott.
Mark Mack, Scott Ross.
Mack est ton parrain.
Il t'apprendra le rčglement.
Emmčne-le ŕ Em City.
Tu l'as connue dehors ?
Ouais, je connaissais son ex.
C'est lŕ.
Lit du haut.
Le bouclage est terminé,
messieurs !
Tu as dix minutes
pour me lâcher la bite.
Schillinger, enfoiré !
Tu es lŕ pour combien ?
Perpčte.
Tu as des cigarettes ?
Eteins ta cigarette.
Je demande pas
de traitement de faveur,
mais on se connaît bien.
Vraiment ?
J'ai été mariée ŕ Glenn
pendant 4 ans.
Pendant ce temps,
tu purgeais une peine de six ans.
On a dű se fréquenter cinq mois.
Cinq mois formidables.
Tu m'as fait des avances.
Glenn se camait trop
pour le voir.
J'étais amoureux,
je le suis toujours.
Garde ça pour le vestiaire !
C'est dur pour toi d'élever
ta fille et de bosser ici.
Tu fais 2 fois plus d'heures
que tu devrais.
Tu peux
gagner du fric autrement.
Tu t'inquičtes pour moi ?
Remballe tes salades.
Retourne ŕ Em City.
Passons
aux heures supplémentaires.
Bonne nouvelle :
ŕ la suite de négociations
avec l'administration
et le syndicat de la police,
on a un accord.
Mauvaise nouvelle : le taux
d'heures sup étant trop élevé,
dorénavant, les agents
n'auront plus le droit
de doubler leurs horaires.
C'est nul !
Les heures sup
seront pas payées ?
Ça fait partie du marché.
Ne te plains pas, Lady Di,
tu verras davantage ton copain.
De quoi tu parles ?
Tu veux dire quoi, Healy ?
Vous voulez cacher
votre liaison.
Tu es marrant, tu sais ?
Assez, vous deux !
McManus,
assieds-toi !
- Enfoiré !
- Assieds-toi !
Healy, garde tes commentaires
pour toi.
Question suivante.
On les emmerde !
C'est pas aussi simple.
Si nos collčgues nous respectent
pas, ça complique les choses.
Tu veux plus qu'on se voie ?
Ce boulot, c'est tout
ce que j'ai. Tu comprends ?
Tu as des diplômes,
une réputation.
Mais si je perds ça,
je retourne faire des ménages
et j'attends les alloc.
Ma fille et ma mčre
ont besoin de moi.
Je peux te donner de l'argent.
Tu as une pension, un emprunt.
Je refuse que tu m'entretiennes.
Non, salut, Tim.
Les cigarettes, ça rapporte ici.
Tu peux tout acheter
avec des clopes
ou des cartouches,
Ça dépend de la personne.
Le problčme,
c'est que ça dure pas.
On peut pas
les garder en réserve.
C'est l'offre et la demande.
- Je les apporte, tu les vends.
- Une cartouche par jour.
C'est tout.
Qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?
Eteins ta cigarette.
Je te reconnais bien lŕ.
Toutes les drogues
ne sont pas douces.
Certaines sont censées
ętre bénignes.
D'aprčs vos résultats d'examens,
vous souffrez d'hypertension.
La malédiction de mon peuple.
Les Afro-américains
ont une prédisposition génétique.
Non, ce n'est pas génétique.
Ça vient du racisme.
Certaines études montrent
un lien entre discrimination
et hypertension,
mais il n'y a rien de sűr.
Pas pour les scientifiques,
mais c'est un fait.
Les ouvriers de couleur ont
plus de tension que les blancs.
Pareil chez les cadres.
Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'on doit accepter
un traitement injuste.
Votre santé me préoccupe plus
que la politique.
Si on ne fait rien,
vous risquez une attaque.
Je vais vous prescrire
du Tinorman.
Quels sont
les effets secondaires ?
Pouls faible,
étourdissements
en vous relevant brusquement.
Impossible. Chaque jour,
je m'agenouille pour prier.
Quoi d'autre ?
Constipation, nausées, vertiges.
Mon esprit doit fonctionner
clairement.
Tout médicament
a des effets secondaires.
Dieu désapprouve
que nous en prenions.
Alors, vous risquez la mort.
Croyez-moi, je n'ai pas
l'intention de mourir.
Je peux partir ?
Navré que tu sois malade.
Qui t'a dit ça ?
Dieu.
Bien sűr, tu parles ŕ Dieu.
Quand il est dans le coin.
Pour l'Islam, deux personnes
parlent directement ŕ Dieu.
Mahomet - qu'il soit loué -
et Moďse.
Tu es en bonne compagnie.
Tu me crois victime d'illusions.
Peut-ętre.
Je vois parfois
dans l'âme des hommes.
Et tu vois dans la mienne ?
Et qu'y a-t-il ?
De la colčre.
Oui, je suis en colčre
contre la société
qui mutile les miens...
qui infecte leur corps.
Non, tu es en colčre
contre Dieu.
Pas du tout. Ma maladie
est la volonté d'Allah.
J'accepte
tout ce qui vient de Dieu.
Mais tu es en colčre contre Lui
et tu as peur.
Peur de mourir.
C'est faux.
Tu as vu Jefferson Keane mourir
et étreindre la mort
comme une maîtresse.
Tu l'as vu et tu as eu peur,
car tu ne souhaites pas
autant partir.
Va-t'en, vieil homme.
Va-t'en !
<i>Le scandale autour
du gouverneur Devlin</i>
<i>a pris une étrange tournure</i>
<i>depuis que sa femme
a quitté leur domicile.</i>
<i>On dit que Mme Devlin
aurait découvert</i>
<i>une liaison
entre son mari et Donna...</i>
Le médecin m'a expliqué.
Ça ne vous regarde pas.
Tu refuses les médicaments.
Je n'ai encore rien décidé.
Tu n'as pas le choix.
Soigne-toi.
Et si je refuse ?
- Je te forcerai.
- Comment ?
Je t'ouvrirai la bouche
et je te ferai avaler les cachets.
Passons un accord.
Tu sais ce que je veux.
J'en sais peu sur l'entrée
de la drogue ŕ Oz.
Sauf une chose :
regarde dans ta propre maison.
C'est-ŕ-dire ?
Quelle accusation !
Il y a plein d'agents
qui ont passé de la drogue.
Soledad, Attica,
ici ŕ Oz, en 82.
Je me souviens.
Deux amis ŕ moi sont tombés.
Alors ?
Je vais faire une enquęte.
Sur tout le personnel,
du bibliothécaire jusqu'ŕ toi.
J'irai lentement,
parce que si c'est vrai,
je veux que les accusations
tiennent la route.
Roger !
Salut, Mike.
- Alors, ce match ?
- Gaston est nul !
- Tu as perdu gros ?
- M'en parle pas.
Diane ! Tu t'en vas ?
Bosser la nuit, c'est tuant !
O'Reilly, va voir Scibetta.
Depuis quand tu fais ses commissions ?
Depuis qu'on est associés.
Tu es le singe
du joueur d'orgue de Barbarie !
Surveille ton petit cul.
Tu le surveilles déjŕ assez.
Me touche pas !
Tu me fais peur.
Vous vouliez me voir ?
Ouais, approche.
Merci, j'aime pas les tomates.
Les Irlandais
apprécient pas
les choses simples.
Si, les patates !
Assieds-toi.
Tu as dit
que tu étais pręt ŕ m'aider.
Bien sűr. Adebisi ręve
de vous faire un sale coup.
Ne t'en fais pas pour lui.
Ce métčque est efficace.
J'ai besoin d'un service
plus délicat de ta part.
Je veux faire cesser
le trafic de Healy.
L'officier Healy...
Dis pas que t'es pas au courant.
Ton frčre et Healy sont amis.
Healy est ton ange gardien,
tu deales pour lui.
Je comprends pas...
Je t'en veux pas,
j'aurais fait pareil.
Mais Healy me fait de l'ombre.
Et ça, je peux pas tolérer.
Alors, je te demande de m'aider.
Vous voulez le coincer ?
Si tu le fais, je promets
de m'occuper de toi. Alors ?
Il a été sympa avec moi.
Ta réponse ?
D'accord.
Comment je fais ?
A toi de voir.
Du moment que tu le fais.
D'accord.
Il me faut des nichons.
Tu en as eu une belle paire.
On est en manque ŕ Em City.
Je peux en avoir quand ?
Plus tard.
Tu me cherches ?
Ça te dit, des nichons gratis ?
- Je tuerai personne.
- Je te demande rien.
Tu veux quoi ?
Va voir tes potes en haut.
Je dis quoi ?
Que tu as trouvé
un nouveau réseau.
Qui tu veux faire tomber ?
Moi.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Emmčne O'Reilly au trou.
Putain de merde !
McManus ! Sors-le d'ici.
Ce sera dans ton dossier.
Rien ŕ foutre !
J'ai tout donné ŕ Oz.
Et maintenant, tu veux prendre
tout ce que tu peux.
Je sais,
bosser ici, c'est pas le pied.
Mais tu as pręté serment
et tu as violé ce serment !
J'ai aucune compassion pour toi.
Emmenez-le !
Un jour,
tu auras besoin de moi
et je serai pas lŕ.
Tu le regretteras !
Tu vas témoigner contre Healy ?
Si je le balance,
je risque de morfler.
Trčs bien.
On se revoit dans un mois.
O'Reilly,
tu sais qui a balancé Healy ?
Aucune idée.
Mais si j'étais joueur,
je parierais sur Pokelwaldt.
Ronald Pokelwaldt souffre
d'un traumatisme crânien.
Et les signes vitaux ?
Je veux sortir !
Tu as fait ton temps.
C'était du gâteau.
C'est quoi, ce jeu ŕ la con ?
Comment tient ton chapeau ?
Avec du velcro ?
- Je joue.
- Tu connais les rčgles ?
Non, mais j'apprendrai.
A plus tard, Adebisi.
Chaque joueur a 12 cartes.
On retourne une carte.
C'est l'atout.
Il y a deux façons de marquer.
Quelle humeur !
Tu as raison,
je suis d'humeur ŕ tuer.
Quelqu'un en particulier ?
Un irlandais et un macaroni.
J'aurais rien contre
me faire Scibetta.
Alors, reste dans les parages.
Le moment venu, il sera ŕ toi.
Tout ŕ moi...
Tu prends de la came.
Les substances chimiques
affluent vers ton cerveau.
Tu veux ces sensations
encore et encore !
Mais on peut aussi
ętre accro au chagrin,
ŕ la culpabilité, ŕ la haine.
Parce que quand
tu te sens mort,
męme ce qui est désagréable
te donne l'impression de vivre !
Alors, pas de petit bisou ?
On dirait que tu m'aimes plus.
Mais si.
Dis que tu m'aimes.
Je vous aime.
Tu l'as dit,
mais sans le penser.
Je le pense, monsieur.
La passion a disparu
de notre liaison.
Mais j'ai le remčde.
Je le gardais
pour ton anniversaire,
mais on en a besoin maintenant.
Non, merci.
Allons, tu vas me vexer !
Et tu sais ce que ça entraîne.
Mets-en.
Je comprends,
tu veux me faire une surprise.
Tu attends l'occasion
de te faire belle.
C'est mignon.
Je peux attendre.
Mais pas trop longtemps.
Une religieuse
n'a pas droit ŕ la beauté ?
Tobias, ça va ?
Bien sűr.
Je ne suis pas aveugle.
Je soigne la toxicomanie.
Si je la détecte pas,
autant changer de métier !
Je comprends pas.
Ecoutez,
la vie est atroce ŕ Oz,
surtout pour un homme comme vous
qui n'est pas préparé
ŕ cette réalité.
La drogue n'est pas une réponse,
elle complique les questions.
Je veux que vous participiez
ŕ mes réunions.
Si vous voulez.
Il a dű commencer récemment.
Espérons qu'on tuera ça
dans l'śuf.
Deux de mes hommes surveillent
les fréquentations de Beecher.
Ça ne vient pas de Schillinger,
il est contre la drogue.
A côté de lui, je suis laxiste !
On devrait en parler
ŕ sa famille.
Sa femme l'a quitté,
mais il a ses parents.
Si on intervenait ?
Je pense que c'est trop tôt.
On devrait faire venir
un de ses parents.
Beecher était alcoolique.
Je sais. C'est terrible !
Il se retrouve ici pour un vice
et il en prend un autre !
Tu sens bon, maman.
Toujours le męme Chanel.
Je me souviens
quand vous sortiez.
Papa et toi, vous mettiez
votre tenue de soirée.
Et cette odeur
flottait dans l'air.
Mais c'était
dans une autre galaxie.
Toby...
j'ai eu une conversation
avec la personne
qui dirige ton secteur.
McManus ?
Il pense
que tu te drogues.
A l'héroďne.
Maman, tu sais pas
ce que c'est ici.
- J'imagine.
- Non !
Et je remercie Dieu
que tu puisses pas l'imaginer.
Si tu veux parler
des études d'Angus,
des poissons péchés par papa
ou du lumbago de grand-mčre,
d'accord.
Mais si tu es lŕ
pour me sermonner,
pour me dire
de ne pas me droguer...
Ne m'achčve pas.
Bonjour, Tobias, asseyez-vous.
Voici un nouveau membre,
Tobias Beecher.
Vous connaissez
Augustus et Ron d'Em City.
Voici John,
Bill
et Whitney Munson.
Je connais un Beecher.
Cyrus. C'est un parent ?
Tant mieux, c'est un enfoiré.
Le but de cette réunion
est de parler
de nos sentiments,
nos dépendances,
dans l'espoir
d'en trouver la cause.
Je connais la cause :
j'aime la came.
D'accord, le plaisir
est un facteur puissant.
Mais il peut cacher autre chose.
Un besoin plus profond,
un vide ŕ combler.
Tobias, dites-nous
ŕ quoi vous ętes accro.
Vous le savez.
Eux aussi.
D'accord.
Augustus, tu veux en parler ?
J'étais accro au crack.
J'ai décroché il y a 22 mois.
- Les amphés.
- Vous avez arręté quand ?
Il y a un an.
Whitney ?
J'ai décroché 7 fois en 52 ans.
Lŕ, c'est mon record :
5 ans, 3 mois et 6 jours.
Quelle drogue ?
Depuis que je suis en taule ?
Tout ce qui se présente.
Mais au départ, c'est l'opium.
J'ai été décoré
de l'Ordre du mérite.
Le mérite...
Moi seul savais
que c'était bidon.
Aprčs ma démobilisation,
j'ai gardé l'uniforme.
En Orient, pendant la guerre,
j'ai gouté ŕ l'opium.
Ma personnalité est liée
ŕ cette drogue de Don Quichotte.
<i>Détenu matricule 45M242,</i>
Whitney Munson.
<i>Condamné le 7 mars 45</i>
d'homicide volontaire
et détention de drogue. Peine :
110 ans.
Conditionnelle
au bout de 60 ans.
Pourquoi avoir étranglé la pute ?
Je savais pas.
Je croyais ętre affectueux.
Elle avait le cou
si pâle,
si fin, si délicat...
Vous ętes en prison
depuis 52 ans, non ?
Plus que 8 ans
avant la conditionnelle.
En 2005...
Je peux plus
écouter ces conneries !
Asseyez-vous.
Non, c'est pas sain !
Salut, ça va ?
Je vais te faire
changer de look.
C'est ton copain qui veut.
Il m'a dit d'insister
si tu refusais.
Mon Dieu !
Encore mieux que je pensais !
Quel beau bébé !
Miguel, ton bébé est mort.
La drogue, c'est moche.
Mais quand le passé est passé,
quand le présent est nul
et quand l'avenir
n'est que promesses brisées
et ręves morts,
Ça tue la souffrance.
Amérique,
tu ne te débarrasseras jamais
de la drogue sans soigner
la souffrance !

A TA SANTE
Saison 1, Episode 6
<i>6% de la population
pénitentiaire a plus de 55 ans.</i>
<i>2 fois plus qu'il y a 10 ans.</i>
<i>55 ans, c'est vieux
parce que cette vie rajoute 10 ans</i>
<i>de rides.</i>
<i>Mais à Oz, tu es bien nourri,
tu fais du sport, des examens.</i>
<i>Si on te bute pas,
tu vis plus longtemps que dehors.</i>
<i>Le système pénitentiaire
te garde en vie,</i>
<i>mais ne s'occupe pas de toi.</i>
On ignore
le vieillissement des détenus.
Oui, Oz a été prévu
pour punir les jeunes.
Mais on n'a pas à mater
un type comme Rebadow.
Que faire ?
Réserver l'Unité 2
aux détenus plus âgés.
Ils pourraient dormir, manger,
jouer aux cartes,
regarder la télé.
Et loto le samedi soir !
Pourquoi pas ?
Ils doivent rester actifs.
Moins de stress ralentirait
le vieillissement
et limiterait
les dépenses médicales.
Il leur faut moins de surveillants,
c'est une économie.
McManus, tu es bien bavard.
Tu as un avis là-dessus ?
C'est une bonne idée.
C'est tout ?
Je soumettrai la proposition.
- La réunion est terminée.
- Enfin !
Tim, ça va ?
On dirait pas.
- Tu te sens bien ?
- Mais oui !
Dînons ensemble.
Mais tu me prends pour un con !
Pas du tout.
Merci de ton offre,
mais j'ai pas besoin
de ta pitié.
Bob Rebadow est à l'hôpital.
- Et alors ?
- Ça m'emmerde !
- Et alors ?
- On dit que c'est ta faute.
Qui dit ça ?
J'ai mes sources.
Je sais que c'est vrai.
On frappe pas les vieux !
Vous voulez quoi ?
Tu vois ces mecs ? Ils seraient
ravis de te botter le cul !
J'ai pas peur d'eux, ni de vous.
Alors, de quoi tu as peur ?
De rien !
Tu as peur de ça ?
Tu as peur de mourir ?
Sale petit connard !
Fous le camp !
Leo, tu fais quoi ici ?
Pareil que toi. J'aime m'entraîner
quand il y a personne.
Fais comme si j'étais pas là.
McManus, tu te sens bien ?
Tout le monde me demande ça !
Ces derniers temps,
tu as changé.
Je vais bien.
Notre proposition sur l'unité
pour le 3ème âge a été refusée.
Sans blague !
C'est cet enfoiré de gouverneur
qui a refusé.
Devlin a pratiquement
quitté ses fonctions.
Il est accusé d'avoir touché
des pots de vin, d'extorsion
de fonds.
Il va me manquer.
On dit que tu habites
à Emerald City,
que tu rentres plus chez toi.
Tu écoutes les ragots ?
Je suis ici depuis un bail.
L'endroit a changé,
pas seulement les détenus.
Fais attention, Tim,
sinon Oz te piquera ton âme.
Tu m'avais jamais appelé Tim.
<i>Pas la peine d'avoir 55 ans
pour être vieux.</i>
- Fais une pause.
- D'accord, McManus.
Comment ça va ?
Je peux plus rester ici.
- A l'hôpital ?
- A Oz.
Pourquoi ?
J'ai peur.
De quoi ?
D'eux, les jeunes.
A mon arrivée ici,
on traitait bien les vieux.
Mais avec les jeunes,
Ça a changé.
J'ai décidé de partir.
De m'évader.
Comment ça ?
Dieu me guidera.
Le corps humain...
C'est dingue.
Constitué de ces cellules,
ces neutrons,
ces veines, toutes ces conneries !
Tellement de petites choses
qui peuvent dérailler.
Ajoute à ça l'usure du corps,
la drogue, l'alcool
et le poulet frit.
Si on tient debout
et si on respire encore,
c'est un miracle.
Petit déjeuner, les gars !
Tiens, Alvarez !
On a un problème.
Il joue la comédie ?
Un médecin !
<i>Détenu matricule 43A515,
Ricardo Alvarez.</i>
<i>Condamné le 3 mars 43
pour vol à main armée.</i>
<i>Peine : 20 ans.</i>
<i>Condamné le 6 juin 61
pour homicide volontaire.</i>
<i>Peine : prison à perpétuité,
régime cellulaire.</i>
On va faire
une série d'examens.
Pardon ?
Votre mère ?
Où êtes-vous ?
Dans quelle ville êtes-vous ?
Le traitement calme
la paranoïa de Cragin.
Il doit continuer.
Absolument.
Ensuite, il y a Miguel Alvarez.
J'ai prévu
de faire
une évaluation psychiatrique.
Bonne chance.
Son bébé est mort-né.
Il est déprimé.
Ça va empirer. Son grand-père
a la maladie d'Alzheimer.
Sa famille est au courant ?
Pas encore. Son fils Eduardo
travaille avec moi.
Je le lui dirai.
C'est celui
qui n'a pas de langue ?
Je parlerai à Miguel.
Tim, tu veux bien
que je m'en charge ?
Je tiens pas à annoncer
de mauvaises nouvelles.
Suivant.
- Miguel, suis-moi.
- J'ai rien fait !
Viens, s'il te plaît.
Personne savait que Ricardo
perdait la boule ?
Il est au régime cellulaire,
il parle à personne.
On n'aurait rien pu faire
contre cette maladie.
Et maintenant ?
C'est le problème.
Oz n'est pas équipé
pour ce genre de cas
et il n'y a pas d'autre endroit
où l'envoyer.
L'Etat n'a rien prévu
pour les vieux détenus ?
L'attitude de l'Etat
envers les personnes âgées,
en prison ou pas, c'est :
"Dépêche-toi de mourir."
Je veux voir mon grand-père.
C'est Miguel
et Eduardo.
Eduardo, ton fils.
Miguel, ton petit-fils.
Vous savez ce qu'on devrait
faire d'Alvarez ?
Quoi ?
Le libérer.
Mais c'est un assassin !
Il a vengé son fils.
- Et il est vieux.
- Il est vieux.
Vieux ne signifie pas gentil.
Si vous en doutez, passez
10 minutes avec ma belle-mère.
Un détenu de 31 ans
coûte 21 000 $ par an.
Un vieux coûte trois fois plus.
Depuis quand
le budget t'intéresse ?
L'argent gaspillé pour Alvarez
pourrait être mieux utilisé.
D'ailleurs, Ricardo ignore
ce qu'il fait là.
La ménopause criminelle,
Ça existe !
Il ne commettra plus de crime.
Ce n'est plus une menace.
Ça change en rien
ce qu'il a fait.
C'est ça, la perpétuité.
S'il sait pas qu'il est en prison,
il est déjà libre, non ?
Dans mon enfance, mon père
et mon grand-père sont venus à Oz
Je me demandais toujours
ce que la prison avait de mieux
que nous.
Quand on est gosse, on sait pas !
Le mot "grand-père" signifie
quelque chose pour vous,
du point de vue affectif ?
Rien.
Ça veut rien dire pour moi.
"Pizza" a plus de sens.
Ou "poignée de porte".
Vous aimeriez que "grand-père"
ait un sens ?
Le Dr Nathan ignore combien
de temps votre grand-père vivra.
Votre père travaille à l'hôpital
et va s'occuper de lui.
Vous pourriez faire pareil.
Si vous vous occupiez de lui,
vous apprendriez à l'aimer.
Dans ma famille,
Ricardo était un dieu,
c'était une légende.
Ma grand-mère
me montrait des photos,
me parlait de lui.
Et je voulais être comme lui !
Mais je vois
que c'est qu'un homme.
C'est qu'un vieil homme,
en train de pourrir.
Je veux pas finir comme lui !
Vous n'y êtes pas obligé.
Je vois pas comment
Ça pourrait finir autrement.
Rebadow !
Désolé que tu aies pas réussi.
Ça en valait la peine.
Avec la montée d'adrénaline,
j'ai cru retrouver mes 25 ans.
Ton dîner.
J'en veux pas.
Tu veux quoi ?
Je voudrais finir ma vie
par quelques années
de liberté.
<i>Est-ce qu'on tient aux malades
sincèrement...</i>
<i>ou est-ce parce que,
le moment venu,</i>
<i>on veut qu'on tienne à nous ?</i>
<i>Quelle importance ?</i>
<i>"Au moins, tu as la santé."</i>
Je déteste qu'on dise ça !
Tu perds ton boulot, ta femme,
tu es en prison
et un connard te dit ça !
Comme si ça remontait le moral !
Si je suis fauché,
si un dealer veut me niquer ?
J'ai pas le cancer !
Le prochain qui me dit :
"Au moins, tu as la santé"
gardera pas la sienne
longtemps !
Vous dites faire des cauchemars.
Vous vous en souvenez ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
J'ai mal à une dent.
Ça dure depuis une semaine.
Allez voir le dentiste.
Pourquoi ?
- J'ai horreur du dentiste !
- Tous ?
Ou le Dr Cochern
en particulier ?
Le concept de dentiste.
Vous préférez
le concept de douleur ?
Prenez rendez-vous.
- Bon sang !
- Quoi ?
Nom de nom,
Donald Groves a rendez-vous !
Et alors ?
Il a mangé ses parents.
Je mets pas mes doigts
dans sa bouche.
C'est mon gagne-pain !
Il travaille à l'hôpital
et semble inoffensif.
Vous mettriez vos doigts
dans sa bouche ?
Si je devais.
Il souffre, vous devez le faire.
Et le serment d'Hippocrate ?
Les dentistes
ne prêtent pas serment.
On fait de promesses à personne.
Comment ça va ?
Vous vous sentez bien ?
Parfait.
Voyons ça. Ouvrez la bouche.
Plus grand.
Je peux pas plus.
Très bien.
- Aucun problème.
- J'ai mal.
Ce n'est rien.
Ne faites pas l'enfant !
Comment ?
Rien.
Oubliez
ce que j'ai dit.
Vous avez une dent pourrie.
Il va falloir l'arracher.
Je vais vous faire
une piqûre de novocaïne.
Je déteste ça !
Ensuite,
je passerai à la roulette.
Je déteste la roulette.
En ce moment, moi aussi.
Je voudrais qu'il y ait
une dentisterie holistique.
Je souffre.
Ce sera pire
pendant l'intervention.
Mais ensuite,
vous ne souffrirez plus.
Si je vous fais mal,
ne me mordez pas !
Enfin...
J'ai compris.
Allons-y.
D'abord, la novocaïne.
Ouvrez grand.
Carol !
Vous pouvez m'aider ?
C'est ma dent.
Elle était en moi.
On a passé notre vie ensemble.
Cette dent a mâché ma mère.
Vends-la.
Une dent de Donald Groves.
Tu sais combien ça vaut ?
Combien ?
Un paquet.
Qui l'achèterait ?
Des collectionneurs.
Les gens collectionnent
n'importe quoi.
Les timbres, les salières,
les poivrières...
Même les trucs de criminel.
L'échelle de Lindbergh,
les ongles de Ted Bundy...
Et ça...
Il va falloir la fourguer.
En prison, c'est pas dur !
Ross, si on en tire
un bon prix...
J'en ai encore 30.
L'esprit est comme le corps.
Constamment agressé.
<i>Par la peur, la haine,
et notre vieille copine</i>
<i>la solitude.</i>
<i>Ces trucs sont aussi mortels
que le cancer.</i>
<i>L'esprit est comme le corps.</i>
<i>Le fait que l'esprit survive,</i>
<i>c'est un miracle.</i>
Le prochain concurrent
est le ravissant et talentueux
Tobias Beecher.
On sait que Beecher se drogue.
Je commence à comprendre.
Il se prend pour une victime,
il ne guérira qu'en prenant
sa vie en main.
Il est en prison,
sa vie lui échappe !
Il faut qu'il se ressaisisse
et comprendre que la victime,
c'est la fillette qu'il a tuée.
Mon mari a refusé de venir.
Il a dit
qu'il craignait de vous tuer.
Voilà Kathy.
Pardon, je ne voulais pas...
Je ne sais pas trop
pourquoi je suis venue.
Au procès, j'étais assise
derrière vous.
Je voyais mal votre visage.
Je crois que je voulais enfin...
vous voir.
Voir vos yeux et vous dire
qu'elle me manque
à chaque instant, chaque jour.
Salaud de merde !
J'espère que tu crèveras ici,
enfoiré !
J'espère que tu
pourriras en enfer !
Tu as tué
mon bébé !
Je sais pas...
Je laisse Schillinger m'humilier
parce que je mérite d'être puni,
parce que...
j'ai tué Kathy Rockwell.
Parce que j'ai brisé sa famille...
et la mienne.
Et vous vous détestez.
Je crois que je me détestais
déjà avant. Alors, je buvais.
Et je me détestais
parce que je buvais trop.
Pour me punir,
je buvais encore plus.
Ma sœur...
je veux plus me détester.
Tu ne me la fais pas !
Tu as réussi à chanter
en te camant !
Tu sais que je veux pas de ça.
Je regrette, monsieur.
Non, c'est moi.
Mets ça.
Parfait.
Non, garde-le.
Je vais me faire tuer
par un Noir.
Je sais.
A quoi ça rime ?
Il y a un nouveau.
C'est super.
C'est bien pour vous.
Je déménage.
Pourquoi ?
Je veux pas
qu'un nègre t'encule.
Salut, tapette.
O'Reilly,
il faut que tu m'aides.
Schillinger veut ma mort,
je dois porter ça.
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
Quitte à partir,
que ce soit en planant.
Tu connais le PCP ?
<i>Des troubles ont éclaté
au tribunal</i>
<i>où le gouverneur Devlin
est jugé.</i>
<i>Si Devlin est reconnu coupable,</i>
<i>il risque 25 ans de prison</i>
<i>pour fraude,
extorsion de fonds, racket.</i>
Enfoiré !
Pardonnez-moi, monsieur !
Je m'envole d'ici !
Beecher, descends !
Gros connard !
A l'aide !
Ecartez les mains
de votre visage.
Il me faut des pansements.
L'œil est touché,
il risque de le perdre.
Il faut qu'on l'opère vite
à l'hôpital de Benton.
Je vais buter cet enfoiré !
Beecher, tu es mort !
Tu dois reprendre les séances.
Je vous emmerde !
Sinon, tu seras transféré.
On essaie de vous aider.
Je vous emmerde !
Si tu as peur
que Schillinger te tue,
je te placerai sous protection.
Je vous emmerde tous !
On dit :
"Elle m'a brisé le cœur."
C'est de la connerie !
Un muscle, ça se brise pas,
Ça se déchire,
Ça a des crampes.
Le cœur est un muscle.
Comme le cerveau,
comme la queue.
O'Reilly,
donne-lui le balai.
Tu es dispensé de corvée.
Tant mieux.
Dino Ortolani dirigeait
la cuisine à la baguette.
C'était le meilleur.
Joey était bon,
Markstram aussi.
Mais Adebisi
n'est pas vraiment à sa place.
Il est pas concentré
sur son boulot.
Il abuse des privilèges.
Tout le monde vole,
mais il exagère.
Tu es malin.
Et tu as accompli les missions
que je t'ai confiées.
Je te nomme
responsable de la cafétéria.
C'est moi qui commande ici !
Et tu bâcles ton boulot.
J'ai des fruits pourris,
des plats froids.
Glynn se plaint des dépenses.
Je travaille pas avec lui.
Et si tu retournais
à l'atelier ?
J'aime pas ça.
Alors, boucle-la !
A toi de jouer.
Reprenez le travail, mesdames.
On était associés.
On l'est toujours.
Pour ce qui est de la came,
je me plains pas de toi.
Mais je veux pas
que tu bousilles la cuisine.
O'Reilly se débrouillera bien.
J'emmerde ce connard d'Irlandais !
Arrange-toi comme tu veux.
O'Reilly dirigera la cuisine
aussi bien que Dino.
On parie ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fous, Wangler ?
- Rien !
- Justement, active un peu !
On fait de notre mieux.
Je suis pas dupe.
Je comprends pas.
Adebisi, écoute-moi.
Je sais pourquoi Scibetta
m'a nommé ici.
Il veut diviser
pour mieux régner.
Tant qu'on est à couteaux tirés,
c'est le roi.
Enculé !
Tu fais quoi ?
Toi et moi,
on a qu'un seul but :
reprendre le trafic de drogue
de Scibetta.
On doit s'unir.
Qu'il croie qu'on se déteste.
On va le tuer.
Si on le tue,
la Mafia nous tue.
Pas si on met ça
dans sa bouffe.
Du verre.
Si on est malins,
il le sentira pas.
Mais le verre
lui déchirera les boyaux.
Il mourra à petit feu.
Et en souffrant.
T'es un vrai malade, O'Reilly !
Venant de toi,
c'est un compliment.
Wangler !
Apporte la bouffe de Scibetta.
Pas de problème.
Et dis-leur
de reprendre la cadence.
Bougez-vous tous le cul !
Alors, Ryan,
si vous étiez libre,
que feriez-vous ?
Je voyagerais, ici et là.
Depuis que je suis là,
je lis des brochures de tourisme.
C'est génial quand on est
aux chiottes ou pour s'endormir.
En dormant,
on rêve de ces endroits.
Par exemple ?
Morogoro.
Morogoro,
c'est dans la jungle, non ?
Vous connaissez ?
C'est en Afrique.
On y va ensemble ?
Moi ?
Ouais, vous et moi...
Je suis une religieuse.
A Saint Pat's, j'ai jamais vu
de religieuse comme vous.
Saint Pat's ?
Un quartier difficile...
J'ai appris l'alphabet
à la dure : LSD, HIV...
Je vois.
Ma sœur, dans 12 ans,
j'aurai la conditionnelle.
Je veux y arriver vivant.
Je sortirai d'ici, je survivrai.
Neuf de pique.
Atout !
Ça va, Nino ?
J'ai juste un peu la nausée.
Je t'ai dit
que ta sauce
était trop piquante.
je sais pas ce que tu fous dedans,
mais ça pique !
Atout !
J'étais accro au crack.
Et puis, j'ai eu mon accident.
A l'hôpital,
je me suis désintoxiqué.
Mais c'était facile,
les médecins me donnaient
de la morphine,
du Demarol, du Percodan.
Je savais pas que je souffrais,
ni que j'étais à l'hôpital,
paralysé.
En arrivant ici,
je suis allé aux séances.
Je vis au jour le jour.
Chaque jour, je pense à la came,
au fait de pas en prendre.
Chaque jour, à chaque heure,
à chaque minute. Rester clean
est devenu mon obsession,
c'est à ça que je suis accro.
<i>12 ans pour tentative de viol.</i>
Merde !
Jackson Vahue a pris 12 ans.
Et il va venir à Oz.
<i>...la peine maximale,</i>
<i>pour montrer que personne,</i>
<i>pas même un grand sportif,
n'échappe...</i>
Votre bureau devrait être
accessible en fauteuil roulant.
Mets ça dans la boîte à idées.
Je veux être
le parrain de Vahue.
Pourquoi ?
C'est un as du basket-ball
et je suis un inconditionnel.
Qui te dit qu'il viendra ici ?
Vous aimez les vedettes, enfoiré !
On peut pas te traiter
de lèche-cul !
D'accord, tu seras son parrain.
- Il arrive quand ?
- Demain.
La fanfare sera prête d'ici là ?
<i>Détenu matricule 97V588,</i>
<i>Jackson Vahue.</i>
Condamné le 17 août 97
pour tentative de viol.
Peine : 12 ans.
Conditionnelle dans 5 ans.
Vahue ! Attends
qu'on te transfère à Em City.
Les autres, maintenant
que vous avez pris votre douche,
vous suivrez l'officier Smith
jusqu'à vos appartements.
Par ici, allez !
Jackson, je voudrais
un autographe pour mon fils !
Alors, Jackson, ça baigne ?
Quoi de neuf, Jackson ?
Joli coup.
Je pensais te trouver ici.
Fous-moi la paix !
Je dois t'aider à t'adapter.
M'adapter à cette merde ?
- Tu viens de la cité ?
- Ouais.
Moi aussi.
On passe son temps à s'adapter !
On cherche à survivre,
à comprendre pourquoi on a rien.
Il y a trois façons
de s'en sortir.
Dealer, chanter ou cette merde.
Il faut du talent
pour les trois.
J'ai juste eu de la chance.
Putain, je peux mettre
la balle dans le panier !
Je me suis adapté,
je suis riche et célèbre !
Je suis habitué aux tournées,
aux femmes.
Peut-être pas aux femmes.
Là, j'ai merdé !
Mon talent ne sert à rien ici !
Comment tu veux que je m'adapte ?
Je vous emmerde !
Je ferai pas ça.
Mais si.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Le roi du basket refuse la corvée.
A Em City, tout le monde
a un boulot à faire.
Donnez-m'en un autre.
On choisit pas.
Ecoutez, je fais pas
les vitres ! Vu ?
Je fais pas les vitres !
Va falloir nettoyer tout ça.
<i>George Washington Carver.</i>
Ses parents étaient esclaves,
mais il a réussi.
Il est allé à l'université,
est devenu botaniste,
puis ingénieur agronome.
Il a découvert divers usages
pour la cacahuète,
la patate douce, le soja...
M. Vahue, vous m'écoutez ?
Bien sûr. Le soja...
On reprendra
la semaine prochaine.
Je sais que vous êtes
une star du basket-ball.
Mais si vous n'écoutez pas,
je ferai un rapport.
C'est ça, nègre !
C'est vous, le nègre.
Tu as de la came ?
Alors, à quoi tu sers ?
Jackson, on a fait ça
exprès pour toi.
Merci.
J'ai gagné du fric
en pariant sur toi.
Tu veux un autographe ?
Non, ta gloire
ne signifie rien pour moi.
Si ce n'est que tu comptes
pour les enfants.
Tu es un exemple.
J'ai pas demandé à l'être,
merde !
Mais tu l'es.
Tu portes
une lourde responsabilité.
Va raconter tes conneries
à d'autres !
D'accord, mon frère,
mais on en reparlera.
C'est ça !
Suce-moi, négro !
Faut baiser qui pour se camer ?
Allez, laisse-m'en un peu,
mon pote.
Je rêve de cette liberté,
je suis prêt à tout.
Je veux sauter
par-dessus le mur.
Mais je reviens toujours
à ces nichons ronds et fermes,
à la brulure de la veine.
Je me demande pourquoi
j'ai besoin de came.
Des années ici,
Ça m'a donné envie de came.
Envie de tout effacer,
d'oublier,
de gommer ça de mon esprit.
Viens ici.
Tu veux pas t'éclater ?
Te dégonfles pas, viens.
J'ai décroché depuis 2 ans.
Juste une fois,
Ça va pas te tuer.
On parle du match des Bulls
en 95.
Tu as marqué 58 points.
Exact. Et c'est pas tout.
Je me suis tapé
deux filles en même temps.
Tu as toujours été mon idole.
Je suis un putain d'exemple !
Peut-être, juste une fois.
Tu vas prendre ton pied.
Tu sais que ça sort
du cul de Kenny ?
On passe à Kareem Saïd.
On a diagnostiqué
de l'hypertension.
Ses signes vitaux
semblent se stabiliser.
Il refuse les médicaments.
Pourtant,
il a toutes les raisons de vivre.
Il redoute les effets secondaires
sur son esprit.
Il veut rester lucide.
Je le comprends.
A Oz, il faut rester vigilant.
Et si on changeait
la prescription ?
Tout a des effets secondaires.
S'il ne prend rien,
sa tension risque d'exploser
d'ici peu.
Oubliez que je suis
psychologue et religieuse.
Imaginez que je suis votre mère.
Kareem, prenez vos médicaments !
On devait faire
une évaluation psychiatrique.
En effet. Jouer avec votre tension,
c'est de la folie !
Je suis loin d'être fou.
Dieu m'a doté d'un esprit,
du libre arbitre.
Il m'a permis de choisir.
Je choisis de ne rien prendre.
Et vous choisissez
sans tenir compte des faits.
Vous allez mourir.
Ma santé est une partie infime
d'une plus grande réalité.
Cela a été dur,
mais je l'ai accepté.
Faites-en autant !
Vous êtes une femme de cœur.
Husseini Mershah,
voici Kareem Saïd.
Il t'aidera à t'adapter
à Emerald City.
Bonjour chez toi.
<i>Détenu matricule 97M688,</i>
<i>Husseini Mershah,</i>
<i>alias James Monroe Madison.</i>
<i>Condamné</i>
<i>le 11 août 97</i>
<i>pour tentative d'homicide
et agression.</i>
<i>Peine : 20 ans.</i>
<i>Conditionnelle au bout de 3 ans.</i>
Ce juif a été Omar Salim,
croyant qu'il allait le voler.
Salim n'était même pas armé.
- Et le juif s'en est tiré ?
- Tu le sais !
Alors, il fallait
lui donner une leçon.
Merci, frère Husseini.
Maintenant, prions.
Saïd, écoute,
on doit faire plus que prier.
Mais ça viendra.
Crois-moi, ça viendra.
"Les fidèles
"sont comme un homme.
"Si un œil est atteint,
"tout en lui est atteint.
"Si la tête est atteinte,
tout est atteint."
Tu vas la boucler ?
- Quoi ?
- Tes conneries m'emmerdent !
N'insulte pas la parole de Dieu.
Suce-moi !
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Tout va bien.
Assieds-toi !
Je suis navré.
Je t'emmerde !
Du calme, Ross.
Va faire un tour !
Je t'emmerde !
Asseyez-vous tous.
Il a raillé la parole de Dieu.
Dieu n'a rien à craindre
d'un crétin.
Dieu veut que tu contrôles
tes instincts primitifs.
Dieu veut
que tu sois plus patient.
Plus tu nous entraînes
dans ces escarmouches,
plus tu mines la guerre sainte
qu'on va mener.
- D'où tu viens ?
- Comment ?
D'où tu viens ? Du ghetto ?
Je suis né dans le ghetto.
Mais contrairement aux autres,
j'ai parcouru le monde, Husseini.
J'ai étudié les religions.
J'ai écouté des mystiques,
des chamans, des illuminés.
Je le connais le monde, Husseini.
Tu as peut-être oublié
d'où tu viens.
Je n'ai pas oublié qui je suis.
Allah m'envoie peut-être
pour te le rappeler.
Saïd y va lentement,
Ça m'inquiète.
Il sait ce qu'il fait.
Il est béni par Allah et tout,
mais il peut se tromper.
Et alors ?
Alors, je pense
qu'il nous serait plus utile
comme symbole que comme chef.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Rien, je disais ça comme ça.
Je perds mon temps.
Husseini...
Quoi ?
Tu as une attaque ?
Appelle le médecin.
C'est la main de Dieu,
la volonté d'Allah.
Aide-moi !
Tu dois mourir.
<i>Tous ces petits maux</i>
<i>finissent par avoir un sens.</i>
<i>Corps, esprit...</i>
<i>Corps, esprit... Ils marchent
ensemble ou ils marchent pas.</i>
<i>Il faut prendre soin
de son corps et de son esprit.</i>
<i>Il faut aimer son corps.</i>
<i>La plupart des gens
détestent leur corps.</i>

PLAN B
Saison 1, Episode 7
"Les plus beaux projets des souris
et des hommes ťchouent souvent."
C'est ce que Robert Burns a ťcrit
il y a un bail, en 1785.
Mais c'est toujours valable.
A Oz, on a toutes sortes
d'idťes pour changer
nos vies minables et solitaires.
Mais quoi qu'on prťvoie,
quelque chose
qu'on contrŰle pas
vient toujours
tout foutre en l'air.
<i>Prenez Tobias Beecher.</i>
<i>il y a 6 mois,
il se disait qu'aujourd'hui</i>
<i>il fÍterait
les 4 ans de sa fille.</i>
<i>Au lieu de Áa, il hurle ŗ la mort,
car il fait un mauvais trip.</i>
<i>Avant d'arriver ici,
Vern Schillinger</i>
<i>voulait remettre l'Amťrique
dans le droit chemin des blancs.</i>
<i>Mais Beecher a mis du verre
dans son úil pur d'aryen.</i>
<i>Timmy McManus</i>
<i>voit ses rÍves de prison idťale
pourrir ŗ petit feu.</i>
<i>Il y a aussi
le rťvťrend Kareem SaÔd.</i>
<i>Il voulait rassembler les siens</i>
<i>pour lutter contre
les injustices de la justice.</i>
<i>Il planchait lŗ-dessus jusqu'ŗ
ce qu'un infarctus ait le dessus.</i>
<i>Husseini Mershah,
voici Kareem SaÔd.</i>
<i>Allah m'envoie peut-Ítre
pour t'aider.</i>
<i>Assieds-toi.</i>
<i>Au secours†!</i>
<i>Tu dois mourir.</i>
<i>Le leader des
Black Muslims, Kareem SaÔd</i>
<i>est dans un ťtat critique,</i>
<i>ŗ la suite d'une crise cardiaque.</i>
<i>SaÔd, qui a incendiť un entrepŰt
appartenant ŗ des blancs,</i>
<i>critique ouvertement
le systŤme judiciaire.</i>
On aurait dit qu'il le savait.
Juste avant son attaque,
SaÔd m'a dit :
"Husseini, s'il m'arrivait
quelque chose,
"rassemble les fidŤles.
"Poursuis mon úuvre
et ma mission.
"Dťclenche la guerre sainte
ŗ Oz,
"une guerre qui embrasera le ciel."
Il m'a dit :
"Parle-leur et guide-les."
Putain†!
Regarde qui est vivant†!
Il faut que je te dise
qu'on pariait que tu crŤverais.
Groves, prťviens le Dr Nathan.
«a va dťmťnager†!
Tu devrais pas faire Áa†!
Connard de nŤgre†!
Groves, appelle un mťdecin†!
Toi†!
Donne-moi tes vÍtements.
Tout de suite.
Je vous dis que je vais bien.
Vous avez failli mourir.
Mais je ne suis pas mort†!
Excusez-moi.
Et si Áa se reproduisait†?
Je sais quoi faire
pour rester en vie.
Je suis prÍt
ŗ retourner ŗ Em City.
Il faudra suivre
le traitement du Dr Nathan.
D'accord†?
D'accord.
Je connais le chemin.
<i>Les gens sont cruels
avec les gens.</i>
<i>D'oý toutes ces prisons.</i>
<i>Les gens violent
d'autres gens.</i>
<i>Ils volent et frappent
d'autres gens.</i>
<i>Mais le pire des crimes,
c'est la trahison.</i>
<i>En prison,
il y a pas de mot pour Áa.</i>
Husseini Mershah†!
Tu m'as vu mourant
et tu m'as laissť.
Tu voulais ma mort.
Non, mon frŤre†!
Je voulais pas...
Cet homme est notre ennemi.
Dťsormais, il est banni.
Aucun musulman ne lui parlera,
ne le regardera.
Tu as voulu la mort d'un autre,
tu es mort pour nous tous.
Kidnapper la femme du prťsident
sans projet.
Kidnapper la femme du prťsident†!
J'ai un projet
gravť au couteau
dans ma main.
Je vais devoir serrer le poing,
errer dans Washington
sous la pluie,
attendre que la salope
sorte ses poubelles,
fasse une confťrence de presse
sur l'essor du pays.
C'est lŗ que Áa commencera.
Quand il caresse son chien
et embrasse sa femme, j'arrive.
Je la serre par le cou
et je l'empÍche de gueuler.
Je lui chuchote : "Ton mec
peut pas t'aider, il est parti†!"
J'appelle le mari
pour lui filer rendez-vous.
Je la mets dans une bagnole,
un drap sur la tÍte.
Et je lui dis :
"Si tu la boucles pas,
je te fais sauter la cervelle."
Elle flippe.
Si elle pige pas,
je lui file un coup de main.
"Je vais te flinguer, chťrie†!"
Je l'emmŤne
dans ma piaule. Je lui mets
des Reebok violettes aux pieds.
Je lui donne 4 gosses affamťs,
pas de boulot,
et son dernier chŤque d'alloc.
Je lui ajoute
une sale tumeur au cou.
Je lui dis : "Dťmerde-toi,
reste en bonne santť."
Au bout d'un certain temps,
je lui prťsente le crack
et le soulagement que Áa apporte
quand on attend un chŤque.
Je lui fais vendre
ses bijoux pour Áa.
Et un soir, je dťbarque
et je dis :
"Tu vas avoir des problŤmes.
"Tu passeras pas
une bonne nuit.
"T'auras pas la paix
avant de crever."
Alors, je l'emmŤne sur le toit.
Je lui montre
toute la merde qu'elle a pas.
Je l'emmŤne au bord du toit
et je la laisse seule.
On joue deux contre deux†?
Je peux avoir le ballon†?
Je peux pas l'avoir†?
Passe-le-moi†!
Arif†! On se fait
un match de basket†?
Non†?
Allez†!
Au nom d'Allah, le clťment...
Qu'est-ce que tu as†?
Allah est unique et un.
Jamais j'aurais dit
que je voulais la mort de SaÔd.
Il est fou.
C'est ŗ cause du traitement.
Nul ne L'ťgale.
Au nom d'Allah,
le clťment, le misťricordieux...
Si tu t'endors,
tu risque de pas te rťveiller.
Adebisi†!
Mon frŤre africain†! «a va†?
J'ai ŗ te parler.
A moi†? Parler de quoi†?
De SaÔd. Il est responsable
de la mort de Keane.
C'est de l'histoire ancienne†!
Ecoute, SaÔd doit mourir.
Je sais ce qui se passe.
Ils t'ont exclu.
Et tu crois
que parce qu'on est
de la mÍme couleur,
on est liťs†!
Dťgage†!
Essaie ŗ cŰtť.
SaÔd veut dťclencher
une ťmeute.
Il veut prendre le pouvoir.
Tu as des preuves†?
Non, il me l'a juste dit.
Il nous faut du concret.
Il stocke des armes†?
Que des trucs faits maison.
Pourquoi tu fais Áa†?
Pourquoi balancer SaÔd†?
Pour arrÍter la violence.
Tu parles†!
Tu sais pourquoi il est lŗ.
C'est ťvident†!
«a crŤve les yeux†!
Sors-le†!
Mais attendez...
Dehors†!
Il peut nous donner
des informations importantes.
On tirera rien de lui.
Il est hors circuit.
Je vais le faire transfťrer.
Pourquoi†?
Je veux pas que Áa dťgťnŤre
entre SaÔd et lui.
Je le transfŤre†!
A quand remonte
la derniŤre fouille ŗ Em City†?
15 jours.
C'est le moment de recommencer.
Fouille†!
Je peux pas
vous mettre tous au trou
parce que le trou est plein.
Je peux pas vous transfťrer
parce qu'Oz aussi est complet.
Mais je peux supprimer
vos privilŤges.
Pas de tťlť, pas de sport,
pas d'appels
pendant un mois.
On est aussi privťs de sortie,
papa†?
Deux mois†!
Tu es content, Alvarez†?
SaÔd semble le seul
ŗ pas avoir d'arme.
Il est pas idiot.
Qui a mouchardť†?
Il paraÓt que c'est Mershah.
Tu sais, Kareem,
tu es censť Ítre imam,
professeur.
Et tout ce que tu m'as enseignť,
c'est qu'Allah
n'est que haine et vengeance.
Alors, fais gaffe, pigť†?
Il pourrait t'abandonner
comme Il m'a abandonnť.
<i>Vous voulez tuer un homme†?
Poignardez-le.</i>
<i>Vous voulez torturer un homme†?
Nourrissez sa solitude.</i>
<i>En manque d'amitiť, de paix,</i>
<i>il cherchera partout.</i>
<i>En comprenant
qu'il n'en trouvera pas,</i>
<i>il se dťtruira.</i>
<i>Je vous ai fait venir
parce que je m'inquiŤte.</i>
La mort d'Husseini Mershah
illustre
la brutalitť qui rŤgne ici.
Mais c'ťtait un suicide.
D'aprŤs les autoritťs.
Mais six hommes sont morts
dans d'ťtranges circonstances :
asphyxie,
incendie, mutilation...
Et la liste continue.
Glynn reste dans son bureau,
ŗ l'ťcart.
Le FBI a fait une enquÍte.
Mais oý est son rapport†?
Vous insinuez qu'on le cache†?
Je ne sais pas.
J'ai posť la question
en espťrant que la presse
dťcouvre la vťritť.
Parce que les dťtenus d'Oz
attendent des rťponses
qui ne viennent jamais.
<i>L'enquÍte du FBI sur les morts
de la prison d'Oswald continue.</i>
<i>On ne la b‚clera pas</i>
<i>pour plaire aux mťdias
ou aux dťtenus.</i>
<i>On compte faire notre travail
en profondeur.</i>
Ton ťmission
a intťressť tout le monde.
C'ťtait ta derniŤre prestation,
je demande le black-out.
Vous ne voyez pas
que ce black-out
est une ťnorme erreur†?
Vous n'en sortirez pas blanchis.
Ne fais pas le malin avec moi,
enfoirť†!
Depuis ton premier jour ici,
tu essaies de dťtruire
ce que j'ai b‚ti
et ce que je reprťsente.
Quel orgueil†!
Je connais bien Áa.
Vous vous donnez
trop d'importance.
Cette chose
est plus grande que vous.
Et plus grande que moi.
Alors, allez-y,
ordonnez le black-out,
censurez nos lettres,
b‚illonnez-nous.
Quelqu'un dira toujours la vťritť.
La vťritť se fera entendre.
Je peux y aller†?
C'est l'heure de prier.
La direction
annonce de nouvelles rŤgles.
Les dťtenus ne pourront utiliser
ni chapelet ni tapis de priŤre,
ni huiles spťciales
dans un but religieux ou autre.
Les dťtenus n'auront plus de droit
de porter de signe distinctif
d'appartenance ŗ un groupe,
un gang ou une religion.
Vous violez notre droit
de pratiquer librement
notre religion.
Pratiquez tant que vous voulez.
Priez jusqu'aux calendes.
En tant que prisonnier,
la constitution
ne te garantit aucun droit.
Du calme†!
Vous devez cťder.
Il y a deux solutions.
Je vote contre le sang.
Ce geste ne signifie rien.
Notre foi ne rťside pas
dans un koufi ou un chapelet.
Elle est dans notre cúur.
Votre attention ŗ tous,
s'il vous plaÓt†!
J'ai des nouvelles pour vous.
Le rapport du FBI
va Ítre rendu public.
Il affirmera catťgoriquement
que Sanchez, Ortolani, Post,
Martinez et Markstram
ont ťtť tuťs par des dťtenus.
Silence†!
La mort d'Husseini Mershah
est considťrťe comme un suicide.
Assez†!
Mais il se peut
que des membres du personnel
soit impliquťs
indirectement
dans certains meurtres.
«a suffit†!
Si vous continuez,
je ne pourrai pas finir.
Bien†!
Regarde-toi
et dit comme Salomon :
"Je suis noir, mais je suis beau,
Ű filles de Jťrusalem."
M. SaÔd†!
Je voulais vous dire
que le truc avec les cuillŤres
et Allah,
c'est gťant.
"Salami ŗ la crŤme."
Alors†?
Tu deviens musulman†?
Il sait parler, ce SaÔd.
Il dit qu'on vit mal
ŗ cause de Glynn, McManus...
SaÔd dit que
Glynn est coupable de crimes
pires que les nŰtres.
Tu as dťjŗ tuť†?
Non, j'ai rien fait.
On m'a inventť une accusation,
je suis innocent.
Je croyais que Áa serait dur
de tuer mes parents. Mais non.
Comment tu les as butťs†?
Avec un marteau.
<i>Dťtenu matricule 97G414,
Donald Groves.</i>
Condamnť le 3 juillet 97,
pour 2 homicides volontaires.
Peine : perpťtuitť.
Je devrais tuer Glynn.
Quoi†?
Je devrais tuer Glynn.
Voilŗ ce que tu devrais faire.
J'ai vu le Dr Nathan.
Va la voir
et demande-lui un traitement.
Elle m'a mis
sous antidťpresseurs.
Et j'ai l'impression
que tout baigne, mon vieux†!
Non†!
Ma premiŤre idťe est meilleure.
DŤs que je peux, je tue Glynn.
<i>Donald Groves,
condamnť le 21 aoŻt 97</i>
<i>pour homicide volontaire
du surveillant Lawrence Smith.</i>
<i>Peine capitale.</i>
Tuer des meurtriers,
c'est du gťnocide.
Groves†!
On me bat.
Qui†?
Tu as ťtť condamnť ŗ mort
pour le meurtre de Smith.
L'Etat te donne
le choix de la mťthode.
Je devrais pas vous parler.
C'est vous
qui devriez Ítre mort.
Comment tu veux mourir†?
Injection, chaise ťlectrique†?
Peloton d'exťcution.
C'est pas ce qu'on fait
aux assassins†?
Je peindrai personnellement
la cible sur ton cúur.
M. le directeur†!
J'avais rien contre vous.
Mais il fallait le faire†!
Je vous attends ŗ mon bureau.
Donnez-moi une bonne raison
de pas vous virer.
Lawrence Smith
ťtait un agent remarquable.
C'ťtait un homme remarquable.
Il est mort
pour ce en quoi il croyait :
la justice.
Ce serait plus facile
de se mettre en colŤre,
de punir tous les dťtenus
pour ce crime.
Mais connaissant Lawrence,
il refuserait que sa mort
apporte davantage de souffrance.
Il aurait voulu que sa mort
apporte la paix.
On prend un verre†?
Non, je dois voir la presse.
«a va Ítre sympa†!
Groves
veut le peloton d'exťcution†?
Oui, quel malade†!
On a un peloton†?
Non, je dois en former un.
Je suis responsable.
Pourquoi†?
Smith ťtait mon ami.
Je suis pas sŻr
que ce soit une bonne raison.
Tu confonds vengeance et justice.
On en reparlera.
Vous vouliez me voir†?
J'ai fini.
On a un record de blessures
liťes ŗ des surveillants.
Que s'est-il passť†?
Il m'a frappť
alors que j'avais rien fait†!
Qui†?
Si je parle,
je trinque encore plus.
Depuis le meurtre de Smith,
les surveillants
ont perdu la tÍte.
Tu dois faire quelque chose.
Je sais.
Vous savez†!
Les reprťsailles
sont justifiťes†?
Quelqu'un a tuť Smith : Groves.
Les autres sont innocents.
Je pensais pas
que tu comprendrais†!
Comment Áa†?
Tu as jamais ťtť maton,
contrairement aux autres.
Alors, je comprends pas
la frustration
des matons†!
C'est de la connerie†!
Tu peux pas continuer
ŗ suspendre ces gars.
Ni laisser faire.
On manque de personnel.
Si tu enlŤves des mecs chevronnťs,
oý on va†?
Les nouveaux sont paumťs.
Tu proposes quoi†?
Laisse les gars exťcuter Groves.
AprŤs, tout sera oubliť.
En attendant,
ils se dťfoulent†!
La rťalitť est dure pour toi†!
Je m'appelle Wood,
je remplace Vogelsang.
Vogelsang est un type bien,
mais trop nerveux.
Tu es arrivť quand†?
Il y a 3 semaines.
Un vieux de la vieille†!
Si tu as des questions, pose-les.
«a peut nous sauver la vie.
Compris. C'est Kareem SaÔd†?
En personne.
Il a pas l'air mťchant.
Mťfie-toi des apparences.
Mon linge vous intťresse†?
Je me suis toujours demandť
ce qu'un type connu
comme Kareem SaÔd
portait sous sa chemise...
Je porte pas de sous-vÍtements.
Je vois.
Tu aimes les grands espaces†?
C'est Áa.
C'est avec une tristesse
et un respect immenses
que je remets ŗ Loretta Smith
une mťdaille d'honneur
ŗ la mťmoire de son fils,
l'agent Lawrence Smith,
mort dans l'exercice
de ses fonctions.
Je voudrais
assister ŗ l'exťcution.
Ce n'est pas une bonne idťe.
D'ailleurs, la famille n'a pas
le droit d'Ítre prťsente.
Si je pouvais vous aider,
je le ferais.
Je peux voir Groves†?
J'ignore
si c'est une bonne chose.
Je l'ignore aussi.
Mais vous allez le tuer.
Il sera mort et enterrť.
C'est l'occasion ou jamais.
Je suis Loretta Smith.
Tu as tuť mon fils.
Tu es beau garÁon.
Merci.
Tu as enfreint la loi de Dieu :
"Aime ton prochain."
Je n'arrive pas ŗ te haÔr.
J'ťprouve de la pitiť,
de la tristesse,
mais pas de haine.
Je viens juste
de m'en apercevoir.
Tu es mon prochain et je t'aime.
Et je te pardonne...
de tout mon cúur.
C'est tout.
Merci de vous porter volontaires
pour le peloton d'exťcution.
Depuis que le choix
de cette mťthode a ťtť rťvťlť,
on est submergťs d'appels
de tireurs d'ťlite
proposant leurs services.
Mais nous avons prťfťrť
que cela se rŤgle
de faÁon interne.
M. le directeur†?
L'Etat n'a pas connu
d'exťcution semblable
depuis 1872.
Heureusement, Lenny Burruano
travaillait autrefois dans l'Utah.
Merci.
Bien des gens trouvent
le peloton d'exťcution barbare.
En fait, c'est plus humain
que la chaise ťlectrique.
En tous cas, le protocole
d'une exťcution rťussie.
est l'ťclairage et la distance.
Prťparez-vous
au poids affectif
qu'entraÓne le fait de tirer.
Sachez qu'une des armes
est chargťe ŗ blanc.
On ne saura jamais
qui a tirť la balle fatale.
Quoi†? J'arrive.
Il lui faut un lavage d'estomac.
- Qu'y a-t-il†?
- Overdose.
- Il vivra†?
- Je ne sais pas encore.
Sauvez-le.
Il a ťtť fouillť†?
Comment ces cachets
sont entrťs ici†?
Il nous claque entre les doigts,
OxygŤne†!
Sauvez-le†!
Mais il doit mourir demain†!
Pour la loi, il doit savoir
pourquoi on l'exťcute.
Il faut qu'il soit vivant.
Sauvez la peau de ce con†!
Pourquoi tu restes enfermť†?
Je me cache.
Et Groves†?
Le Dr Nathan l'a ramenť ŗ la vie.
Une rťsurrection†?
L'exťcution a ťtť retardťe ŗ 2h.
Il te manque†?
Groves†?
Avec les annťes, j'ai appris
ŗ pas mal m'attacher. Sinon,
on passe sa vie ŗ souffrir.
Tu sais, je crois que souffrir
vaut bien mieux que se cacher.
"Je vous salue Marie,
pleine de gr‚ce.
"Vous Ítes bťnie
entre toutes les femmes..."
J'ai rťflťchi aux derniers mots
que je voudrais prononcer.
Notez-les
et donnez-les ŗ Mme Smith.
«a la rťconfortera peut-Ítre.
D'accord†?
Vous voulez bien
faire Áa pour moi†?
Bien sŻr.
Elle apprťciera.
C'est l'heure†!
Le ciel est d'un joli bleu.
"Au nom du PŤre,
"du Fils et du Saint-Esprit.
"Que le Seigneur soit avec toi."
Je dois noter
ses derniers mots.
On peut ťcouter par lŗ.
Parfait.
<i>Quels sont tes derniers mots†?</i>
<i>Je voudrais dire que j'ai...</i>
- Qu'est-ce qu'il dit†?
- «a peut se rťparer†?
Il est mort.
Quels ont ťtť ses derniers mots†?
Je sais pas,
j'ai pas vraiment ťcoutť.
Tu bois pendant le service†?
Non, j'ai terminť
depuis 10 minutes.
Tu en veux†?
Non, j'ai jamais apprťciť
la piquette.
Snob†!
A Lawrence Smith,
un type bien
mort trop jeune.
A Donald Groves,
un tordu
qui a vťcu trop longtemps.
Sans doute.
J'ai tuť un homme
qui a tuť un homme.
J'ai tuť un homme.
A moins que j'aie eu
les balles ŗ blanc.
Je saurai jamais
si je l'ai tuť ou pas.
C'est encore pire de pas savoir.
Au moins, si je savais...
Rentre chez toi et dors.
Dormir†!
Quelque chose me dit
que je dormirai pas beaucoup
cette nuit.
"Les plus beaux projets
des souris et des hommes..."
Pour les souris,
je comprends pas.
A l'ťpoque de Burns,
les souris ťtaient plus rusťes†?
A Oz, il y en a,
mais elles sont pas malignes.
C'est des rats
dont il faut se mťfier.
On en a de toutes sortes.
Qui c'est, ce mec†?
Un petit gťnie du violoncelle.
McManus lui a donnť la permission
de s'entraÓner une heure par jour.
Je dois l'ťcouter.
Il joue quoi†?
Aucune idťe.
C'est pas mon style.
<i>Dťtenu matricule 97D403,
Eugene Dobbins.</i>
<i>Condamnť le 18 aoŻt 97
pour homicide.</i>
<i>Peine : 22 ans.</i>
<i>Conditionnelle au bout de 8 ans.</i>
Ce violoncelle
a ťtť fabriquť en 1744
par Johannes Cuypers
ŗ Amsterdam.
Il est bon†?
Oui, pour moi,
il n'a pas de prix.
C'est pour Áa
que l'aumŰnier le garde.
Il est beau.
Beau, mais seul.
Comment un violoncelle
peut Ítre seul†?
J'ai personne avec qui jouer.
Tu joues trŤs bien tout seul.
J'ai l'habitude
de jouer avec 100 musiciens.
Un violoncelle tout seul,
c'est pas pareil.
T'en as†?
- Oý tu vas†?
- A plus†!
Prends-en.
Non, faut que j'aille pisser.
Te dťgonfle pas, allez†!
Vas-y ŗ fond†!
C'est Áa, allez†!
Tout ce que je dis
reste entre nous†?
A ton avis†?
Jackson Vahue.
La star du basket.
Quand il est arrivť, j'ťtais fou
de joie. C'est mon hťros.
Pour ne pas passer
pour un dťgonflť, tu sniffes.
Mais je suis pas redevenu accro,
je vous jure.
Si tu continues, Áa viendra.
Je parlerai ŗ Vahue.
Je trouverai un moyen
d'aborder le sujet
sans t'impliquer.
En attendant, viens ŗ la sťance
anti-drogue de jeudi.
Et arrÍte l'hťroÔne.
Quoi qu'en dise Vahue. D'accord†?
Tu sais,
tu devrais te trouver
un autre hťros...
parce que, franchement,
le tien est nul.
Fais ce que je dis
ou je te dťmolis.
Laisse Dobbins tranquille†!
Te mÍle pas de Áa†!
Je te dis de le laisser...
Va te faire foutre†!
Tire-toi de lŗ†!
Qu'est-ce qui te prend†?
Tu es en manque
et tu le frappes pour rien.
Et alors†?
Il a un don,
il faut pas le g‚cher.
Et mon don ŗ moi, bordel†?
Je crŤve ici†!
On crŤve tous†!
«a me console pas†!
<i>On a tous des problŤmes
impossibles ŗ rťgler.</i>
<i>Un jour, tu tombes sur un type
qui a de plus gros problŤmes,</i>
<i>ou qui s'en sort bien.</i>
<i>Et quelque part, sa faiblesse</i>
<i>te donne de la force.</i>
<i>RŤgle d'or numťro 62 :</i>
<i>en aidant quelqu'un,
c'est toi que tu aides.</i>
J'ai fait
ce que la súur m'avait dit.
Je me suis trouvť
un autre hťros.
Devinez qui c'est†!
C'est moi.
Je suis fier parce que mon plan
a marchť. J'ai fait de mon mieux.
<i>Mais hťlas pour Dobbins,</i>
<i>mon mieux, c'est pas suffisant.</i>
Nino, on joue aux cartes†?
Je suis en pleine conversation.
Oý t'as appris
la politesse,
con d'Irlandais†?
Dťgage†!
Tu crois
qu'ils parlaient de quoi†?
Comment je le saurais†?
Tu t'ťtonnes que Scibetta discute
avec un nŤgre musulman†?
Dťgage†!
Viens.
J'ai entendu dire des trucs.
Moi aussi.
Les musulmans
prťparent une ťmeute.
Il paraÓt qu'ils sont armťs
jusqu'aux dents. Tout est prťvu.
S'ils prennent le pouvoir,
c'est foutu pour nous.
Scibetta passe peut-Ítre
un accord avec SaÔd.
Pourquoi on n'est pas au courant†?
Le vieux nous laisse tomber.
Il faut qu'on s'organise.
C'est sŻr.
Tu as un joker dans ton jeu.
Adebisi†?
Lui aussi dťteste SaÔd.
«a serait bien
qu'il soit avec nous.
Je lui parlerai.
- Tu es prÍt†?
- Presque.
J'ai vu SaÔd parler ŗ Scibetta.
Il sait qu'on met du verre
dans la bouffe de Scibetta†?
Impossible†!
Tu sais que les musulmans
prťparent une ťmeute†?
ArrÍte†!
Bien sŻr.
Si Áa arrive,
oý tu te retrouveras†?
Sur mes pieds, comme toujours.
On a fourni toute la prison.
Ces connards
vont nous tomber dessus.
- Je te couvre.
- C'est ce que je voulais savoir.
Il va mourir quand†?
Je sais pas,
c'est pas une science exacte.
Je veux
qu'il crŤve†!
Tenez, Nino.
«a vous plaÓt pas†?
- J'ai pas faim.
- Mal ŗ l'estomac†?
Vous devriez voir le mťdecin.
J'attends une grosse livraison.
Dis ŗ Adebisi
que ses gars doivent Ítre prÍts.
«a marche.
Il se passe un truc avec SaÔd
que je devrais savoir†?
Non,
mais tu le sauras.
En temps voulu.
Je vais m'allonger.
Dobbins, tu veux une salade†?
Flush et carrť de valets.
J'ai une paire
et un carrť d'as.
Nom de Dieu†!
Qu'est-ce que c'est que Áa†?
Putain†!
Tu as pas l'air en forme.
Salut, Kareem.
Tu es au courant,
pour Scibetta.
Oui, c'ťtait vraiment bizarre.
Il saignait de partout.
Je me demande pourquoi.
- Mauvaise alimentation...
- Trop d'ail.
Il va s'en tirer†?
D'aprŤs le mťdecin,
il a une chance.
En attendant,
on s'occupe de tout. Si tu avais
affaire avec lui, vois avec nous.
J'avais pas affaire avec lui.
Tu as pas intťrÍt ŗ mentir.
C'est un avertissement†?
J'ai un avertissement
pour vous deux.
Repentez-vous ou la colŤre
de Dieu s'abattra sur vous.
Quel dieu†?
Je vois pas de dieu ici.
Je ne vois que toi
et tu as un mauvais cúur.
Tu te trompes,
j'ai le cúur malade.
C'est vous
qui avez mauvais cúur.
Tu peux garder ma montre.
Il a raison,
ton cúur est mauvais.
Qu'est-ce que je peux dire†?
Je suis un enfoirť†!
Je prends celui-ci.
Vous vous souvenez m'avoir
traitť de con d'Irlandais†?
Je suis pas si con, hein†?
Ouvrez la bouche.
Dťsolť,
on est ŗ court de tomates.
Les poŤtes disent
qu'un malheur te change la vie.
Si tu perds ta femme
ou tes jambes,
tu trouves une sorte de beautť
en toi.
C'est ce que disent les poŤtes.
Mais en vťritť, tu changes pas.
Quand il t'arrive un malheur,
tu deviens encore plus
celui que tu ťtais dťjŗ.
<i>Beecher, tu es mort†!</i>
<i>Tu as peur de Schillinger.
Je te placerai sous protection.</i>
<i>Je vous emmerde†!</i>
<i>C'est aprŤs un malheur
qu'on dťcouvre</i>
<i>qui on est vraiment.</i>
Regardez
ce que ce fumier m'a fait†!
Il m'a transformť en pirate.
Il ne perd rien pour attendre.
On peut encore sauver ton úil.
Toujours aussi optimiste†!
Beecher va sortir du trou
et je peux pas
vous garder tous les deux ici.
J'essaie de dťcider qui reste.
C'est ce connard qui a commencť.
C'est lui
qui m'a mis du verre dans l'úil.
Il a agi sans raison†?
Si je dis oui, vous me croyez†?
Tous les deux, vous Ítes pareils.
Beecher et moi†?
C'est comme voir d'un seul úil.
Le point de vue est dťformť.
On voit devant, mais on voit
moins loin autour de soi
et on imagine des trucs.
Quel rapport avec Beecher et moi†?
Les intellos croient que le monde
est tel qu'ils le voient.
Quand vous comprenez
que vous ťtiez loin de la vťritť,
vous devenez amers.
vous devenez mťchants.
Je crois que tu vas nous quitter.
Regardez qui est revenu.
Schillinger t'embrasse, tapette†!
Va te faire†!
«a suffit†!
Beecher, tu voulais me voir†?
Je veux changer de cellule.
Elles sont toutes pleines.
Transfťrez-moi
dans une autre prison.
Tu me prends
pour un agent de voyages†?
Beecher†!
Quoi†?
Rien.
Tu vas crever†!
Pas aujourd'hui.
«a a dŻ faire mal†!
Attache ce connard de nazi†!
Tu te rappelle de Áa, ordure†?
Putain†!
Il lui a chiť dessus†!
On croit savoir
ce dont on a besoin.
On passe son temps
ŗ se demander comment l'obtenir,
qui peut nous aider,
qui nous gÍne.
On joue et parfois, on gagne.
On obtient ce qu'on veut.
Et la vie devient encore pire.

PARTIE DE DAMES
Saison 1, Episode 8
Au lycée,
le prof d'histoire disait
que les actes des grands hommes
changent le cours des événements.
C'était du pipeau.
<i>César, Lincoln et Gandhi
peuvent aller se faire voir.</i>
<i>Le monde bouge grâce à nous,
les anonymes.</i>
<i>Les révolutions commencent
par manque de pain.</i>
<i>Les guerres éclatent
pour une partie de dames</i>
Bonne nuit, grosse merde !
<i>Montez !</i>
Détenu matricule 92S110,
Vernon Schillinger.
Condamné le 21 octobre 92
pour coups et blessures.
Peine : 8 ans.
Conditionnelle au bout de 5 ans.
J'ai eu la visite de mes fils.
Ils sont presque sortis
de l'adolescence.
Ce sont presque des hommes.
Ils vivent avec leur grand-père,
celui qui m'a appris
tout ce que je sais de la haine.
Hier, mes garçons étaient là,
en face de moi,
à discuter et à s'énerver.
Ils étaient défoncés.
Ils savent
que je déteste la drogue.
Je suis là
parce que je déteste la drogue
et parce que je les aime.
Je les ai engueulés...
et ils se sont contentés de rire.
Ils ont ri de moi.
C'est drôle,
avec un œil, je vois enfin
qu'ils deviennent
ce que j'ai fait d'eux.
Il me reste 3 mois
avant la conditionnelle.
Tout ce que je veux,
c'est sortir...
et être là pour eux,
essayer d'aider mes gosses.
C'est tout.
Si tu retournes à Em City,
tu tueras Beecher.
Si j'avais voulu sa mort,
il serait déjà mort.
Tu dis avoir changé.
Pourquoi je te croirais ?
Croyez-moi, McManus,
perdre un œil,
prendre des coups dans les burnes
et se faire chier dessus,
Ça change un homme.
Le revoilà !
Ou est Beecher ?
Toujours au trou.
Mets ça.
Lève-toi !
Vous voulez me toucher la bite ?
Habille-toi.
J'ai chié sur un mec,
c'est pas normal.
Habille-toi.
Schillinger est revenu à Em City
et promet de pas te faire de mal.
Dis-moi
que tu lui feras pas de mal.
Il m'a tatoué une croix gammée
sur le cul.
Il m'a fait déchirer des photos
et bouffer du papier.
Il m'a obligé à me maquiller
et m'a enculé.
Je sais.
Et je devrais lui pardonner ?
Vous le feriez ?
Oui.
D'accord. Je lui pardonne.
Salut, mon vieux !
Toujours aussi dingue ?
Dingue ?
Tu as cassé une vitre,
tu as éborgné Schillinger,
tu lui as chié dessus.
Vous regardez quoi ?
Voilà ce que je veux dire.
L'ancien Beecher
se serait planqué.
J'ai laissé l'ancien Beecher
au trou.
J'ai pigé.
T'approche pas trop de moi !
Le jour où les musulmans
se soulèveront,
j'aurai besoin de toi.
Pour quoi faire ?
Etre mon frère.
A toi de jouer, torche-cul !
Beecher, fais gaffe !
Tu risque de vite
te retrouver au trou !
Torche-cul !
Va falloir éliminer Beecher,
sinon tout le monde
dira que t'es une fiotte.
Je m'en fous. Laisse-les dire.
<i>Quand on joue au poker,</i>
on laisse pas les autres
voir ses cartes,
ses sentiments, ses pensées.
Il faut adopter un masque.
A Oz,
on porte un masque
toute la journée,
<i>et la nuit aussi.</i>
<i>On le porte tellement
que devant la glace,</i>
<i>on sait plus quel visage on rase.</i>
<i>- Je les apporte, tu les vends.
- Une cartouche par jour.</i>
<i>C'est tout.</i>
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Il paraît que tu fais
de la contrebande à Em City.
Quoi ?
C'est pas vrai ?
Qui t'a dit ça ?
- Dis-moi que c'est faux.
- C'est faux.
- Tu mens.
- Non, je mens pas.
Un témoin t'a vue passer
des cigarettes à Scott Ross.
Un témoin oculaire !
Qui ?
Moi.
Je suis virée.
Non, t'es pas virée.
Je sais que tu t'inquiètes
pour l'argent, ta mère et DeeDee.
Mais arrête ces conneries !
D'accord.
Aujourd'hui !
Merci de me laisser une chance.
J'ai parcouru tes dossiers.
Ross et ton ex
étaient dans le même gang.
Fallait me le dire.
Tu as couché avec Ross ?
Quoi ?
Je veux savoir
si tu te l'es fait aussi.
Tu veux me faire payer
parce que je t'ai quitté ?
Tu veux prouver
que tu as une bite ?
Je démissionne !
Merde ! Je suis désolé.
Tu es désolé !
Je sais pas ce qui me prend,
pardonne-moi.
Te pardonner ?
Je te pardonne.
Tu m'as pardonné. On est quittes.
Dis que tu restes.
J'ai nulle part où aller.
J'arrête le trafic de cigarettes.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
C'est trop risqué.
Je veux pas me faire prendre.
C'est pas si simple.
C'est-à-dire ?
J'ai des clients
qui comptent sur moi.
Et alors ?
Tu vas pas tout foutre en l'air
avec ta paranoïa.
J'ai dit que j'arrêtais.
Si tu fais ça,
je raconte tout au directeur.
Je risque le trou. Et alors ?
Mais toi, tu perds ton boulot,
tu seras sûrement condamnée.
La petite DeeDee
se retrouvera sans mère,
marquée à vie.
Tu ferais pas ça !
Et pourquoi ?
Diane,
toi et moi,
on est liés à la vie, à la mort.
Tu peux rien y faire.
Laisse-moi tomber et tu es foutue.
C'est une sacrée bonne femme,
notre Diane.
Une sacrée bonne femme !
Qui c'est ?
Un nouveau, un polaque.
Si les musulmans attaquent,
on est prêts.
Les Hell's Angels, les aryens...
Et les négros ?
Ils sont dans notre camp.
Mais on devrait éviter
d'affronter les musulmans.
Tu te dégonfles, O'Reilly ?
Non, j'essaie de rester en vie.
Quoi ?
Tu fais quoi ?
Rien.
Pourquoi tu vas pas
faire ça ailleurs ?
Connards de matons !
- Tu fais le guet.
- Je sais.
Vas-y, fais le guet !
- Je m'appelle Nowakowski.
- Tu es en retard.
J'étais jamais allé à Oswald,
je me suis perdu.
Je suis Diane Wittlesey.
Voici Joe Mineo.
Sois à l'heure.
Encore un bleu à la con !
Joe est là depuis deux siècles.
il y a eu plein de mises à pied.
Il paraît.
Des surveillants
qui battaient des détenus.
Un maton a été tué.
Certains surveillants
ont décidé de se venger.
Ça a été dur,
espérons que c'est terminé.
Il paraît qu'il y a
des vedettes dans le secteur.
Voilà Kareem Saïd,
le leader des musulmans.
Le moment est venu.
Dispute-toi avec le gardien.
Qu'il se jette sur toi.
Il doit te frapper le premier.
Et ensuite ?
Voilà Eugene Dobbins,
un musicien classique.
On lui a cassé son violoncelle.
On va à la bibliothèque ?
Au gymnase ?
Laisse-moi tranquille.
Il passe son temps devant la télé.
Lui, c'est Jackson Vahue.
Tu as vu le match
contre les Bulls ? 58 points !
Il est génial !
Rebadow !
Tu négliges ton travail
depuis quelques jours.
Dieu m'a menti.
Dieu t'a menti ?
Pourquoi Dieu serait
si différent des autres ?
Merde, j'ai une réunion !
Avant, j'avais des réunions.
Il n'en sort jamais rien de bon.
Détenu matricule 65R814,
Robert Rebadow.
Condamné le 9 septembre 65
pour homicide volontaire.
Peine de mort commuée
en réclusion à perpétuité.
J'ai peut-être jamais
parlé à Dieu.
J'ai peut-être entendu
la voix de ma propre raison.
Vous êtes un homme de raison,
mais vous vous êtes égaré.
Pour l'instant, je suis en retard.
Au travail !
- Je te présente...
- Plus tard.
Excusez-nous.
Vous pouvez parler devant eux.
Allez faire un tour.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Torres est libéré.
Ce con a du pot !
Tu as pris la tête du gang.
Ecouter les ragots,
c'est pécher !
La seule raison pour laquelle
je vous ai pas tabassé,
c'est parce que vous m'avez aidé.
Ne me cherchez pas.
Où j'en étais ?
Tu perdais.
Tu as bougé ce pion ?
Mais si !
Non, je te dis !
Tu as déplacé les pions, connard !
Tu fais ça depuis le début !
Dès que je vais aux chiottes,
tu déplaces les pions.
C'est pour ça que je perds !
Non, t'es nul !
Ça suffit !
Envoie Armstrong !
Armstrong, dépêche-toi !
Saloperie !
T'es nul, enfoiré !
Merde !
Vous savez
ce que vous avez à faire ?
Verrouille toutes les cellules !
Coupe le téléphone !
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Un cauchemar.
Il faut qu'on s'organise !
Le directeur vous parle.
Rendez-vous,
il n'y aura aucune répercussion.
Y a-t-il un responsable ?
A qui peut-on parler ?
Messieurs !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Si vous n'avez pas compris,
on a du pain sur la planche !
Glynn nous laisse le temps
de faire une liste de requêtes.
Mais le plus important
est de rester unis.
Ça me gêne pas.
Moi non plus,
si les règles sont claires.
Par exemple ?
T'es pas le chef.
J'accepte de partager le pouvoir.
C'est pour ça
que je vous ai fait venir.
On pourrait former
une sorte de conseil
et prendre les décisions ensemble.
Combien d'armes tu as ?
Juste une.
C'est pas vrai.
On va devoir apprendre
à se faire confiance.
C'est toi qui as le flingue,
Ça te donne un avantage.
Tu parles de partage du pouvoir,
mais je me méfie de toi.
Comment prouver ma sincérité ?
Donne le flingue.
Et si on répartissait
les responsabilités ?
O'Reilly, Ross, Adebisi,
vous contrôlez déjà l'entrée.
Je propose
que O'Reilly
soit notre porte-parole.
Ross, tu contrôles
la distribution des vivres.
Adebisi,
les autres allées et venues.
Mes hommes devraient avoir
les otages.
D'accord.
Il va falloir lâcher Hunt.
Pas question.
On doit tous
lâcher quelque chose.
Mieux vaut que tous les otages
soient au même endroit.
Il a raison.
Comme on contrôle l'entrée,
les matons n'iront nulle part.
On est tous d'accord ?
Il reste la liste de requêtes.
Qui commence ?
- Je veux voir ma copine.
- Et pouvoir fumer !
Il faut mettre la femme à part.
Les douches ?
Bonne idée.
Dobbins !
Aidez-moi !
Quelqu'un peut m'aider ?
Mets-le dans la salle de douches.
<i>Tu seras toujours mon héros.</i>
<i>Je suis un putain d'exemple !</i>
<i>Il n'a pas de prix.
C'est l'aumônier qui le garde.</i>
<i>Fais ce que je dis
ou je te démolis !</i>
<i>Jackson,
laisse Dobbins tranquille !</i>
<i>Te mêle pas de ça !</i>
C'est tout ce que j'ai trouvé.
Le reste a brûlé.
Putain ! C'est vraiment moche.
J'ai un pote
à qui c'est arrivé.
Il est mort en pleine rue.
Si on soigne pas Dobbins,
on lui jouera un requiem !
Il fait chier
avec son violoncelle !
Tu l'as cassé, hein ?
Emmène-le à l'hosto.
Je risque de morfler là-bas.
On morflera tous.
C'est pas ma faute, Hill !
J'y peux rien.
J'ai pas commencé.
Ça change quoi ?
Etre célèbre te dispense pas
des responsabilités.
Il faut savoir agir.
Regarde-le.
Regarde-le !
Ce violoncelle était tout pour lui,
comme ce fauteuil pour moi !
C'est comme toi et le basket !
D'accord !
Et merde ! Je me suis déjà
fait tabasser. Allons-y.
Porte-le.
Ouvrez la grille !
J'emmène Dobbins à l'hôpital.
- Qu'il crève !
- Ouvrez !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Dobbins est mourant.
Vite, sinon il va pourrir.
Et Saïd et Alvarez ?
Vote oui et on a la majorité.
On a pas besoin des autres.
Si on reste unis,
Saïd est foutu.
On laisse sortir un blessé.
Prévenez Glynn.
Ouvre !
A plus.
Merde !
On tient un de ces salauds.
Tu permets ?
J'ai envie de chier.
Je repense aux bons moments
qu'on a eus ensemble.
Je veux pas me battre.
Evidemment.
Tu risques ta conditionnelle.
Pendant 3 mois,
tu vas être bien gentil
pour sortir et sauver tes fils.
Tu sais, je trouve ça génial !
Mais je me demande une chose.
Et si Vern ne sort pas ?
Et s'il se retrouve mêlé
à une bagarre
avec son ancien copain
de cellule ?
Et si,
dès qu'il pourrait
avoir la conditionnelle,
Vern se trouvait impliqué
dans une sale affaire
et devait purger toute sa peine
et que ses deux fils
devenaient des monstres ?
Voilà ce que je me demande.
Lopette !
Je l'ai mauvaise
et c'est pas bon !
On aime soutenir le perdant.
A la mi-temps,
quand une équipe se fait écraser
et part au vestiaire,
on prie en silence.
On prie
pour qu'ils inversent la vapeur,
qu'ils marquent
et ridiculisent ces salauds !
On adore
ceux qui reviennent de loin.
Faut trouver un moyen
de s'échapper.
Comment ?
Je ne sais pas. Je vais
pas attendre d'être violée.
Ou tuée.
Tu crois qu'ils vont nous tuer ?
Non, ils vont nous offrir du thé.
Armstrong va s'en sortir ?
Mets-toi avec eux.
Et Armstrong ?
Ta gueule, Hunt ! Assieds-toi !
Je m'occupe de vous,
bande d'enfoirés.
Je sais pas jusqu'à quand,
mais restez tranquilles
et tout ira bien.
Armstrong a besoin d'un médecin.
Je vais voir.
Je dois pisser.
Vous êtes proche d'Alvarez, non ?
Je le croyais, mais il n'a pas
levé le petit doigt pour m'aider.
Vous pensiez vraiment
qu'il allait vous aider ?
Il risquerait de se faire buter.
Tu sais comment c'est au trou ?
On a un seau
pour pisser et chier.
On le garde tout le séjour.
Vas-y !
Détache-moi.
Tu as ri
quand mon bébé est mort !
Espèce d'enflure !
Au nom de Dieu, arrête !
Miguel !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Je peux rien changer,
même si je voulais.
Pas la peine de tomber
dans la brutalité !
Quelle naïveté à la con !
Je suis pas naïf.
J'ai peur.
<i>Moi aussi, hermano,</i>
moi aussi.
<i>Il semblerait qu'une émeute</i>
<i>ait éclaté
dans la prison d'Oswald.</i>
<i>Ni le personnel ni le gouverneur
n'ont fait de commentaires.</i>
<i>La violence
régnait dans la prison.</i>
<i>Poussez-vous.</i>
Laissez-le monter.
<i>Même si le directeur
se voulait rassurant,</i>
<i>l'émeute semblait inévitable.</i>
Alors, Alvarez,
comment vont les otages ?
Ils ont besoin d'un médecin.
Qu'on leur en envoie un.
On n'est pas des sauvages.
Mais parles-en aux autres.
Adebisi,
tu devrais y aller mollo.
Pourquoi ?
On a besoin
de toutes nos facultés.
Et si la situation empire,
on risque d'être à court.
Je veux pas te voir en manque
quand j'aurai besoin de toi.
Tu t'inquiètes trop.
Prends-en.
Non, j'ai décroché
depuis mon séjour au trou.
Tu y étais pour quoi ?
Arrêtez !
C'est exactement ce que ces cons
attendent. Et Saïd aussi.
Pourquoi vous croyez
contrôler l'entrée ?
Il attend qu'on s'entre-tue
et après,
il tuera les survivants.
On doit se serrer les coudes !
Kenny !
Il y a deux matons mal en point.
Saïd et moi,
on veut envoyer un médecin.
Tu votes quoi ?
Qu'ils crèvent.
Ça fait 2 contre 2.
Tu peux faire la différence.
Fais la différence.
Ça vaut quoi pour toi ?
Ce que ça vaut ?
Tu me donnes quoi pour mon vote ?
Rien.
Alors, que ces connards crèvent.
Tu parles d'une nouvelle !
J'avais un oncle alcoolique.
Il travaillait dans une crémerie.
Ça a aggravé la situation.
Chaque soir, il rentrait beurré.
J'avais
un autre oncle très savant.
Mais deux brutes l'ont frappé
et laissé sans connaissance.
Assez !
J'avais un autre oncle.
Il récupérait tous les métaux
qu'il trouvait.
Résultat :
il s'est retrouvé en taule !
Ta gueule, D'Agnasti !
J'essaie
de détendre l'atmosphère.
Pas de médecin.
Fais quelque chose.
Je travaillais
à l'hôpital de la prison.
Ça fait de toi un toubib ?
T'es bon qu'à nettoyer la merde !
Ferme-la !
Je pourrais t'aider.
Sûrement pas !
On leur a donné
du temps pour faire leur liste.
Attendons de savoir
ce qu'ils veulent.
Pas de négociations !
On coupe l'eau et l'électricité
et ce soir,
on envoie du gaz lacrymogène.
Et les otages ?
La brigade d'intervention
s'en chargera.
On sait pas où ils sont !
Ni s'ils sont vivants.
Comment croire Saïd ?
Plus on attend,
plus ils s'organiseront !
Même si on verrouille le secteur,
les autres détenus
sont au courant.
On est assis
sur une bombe à retardement.
Je vais révéler l'affaire.
La garde nationale
cernera Oswald.
C'était Hofmiester.
Ils veulent à manger.
Pourquoi on accepterait ?
Laissons-les crever de faim !
Donnons-leur des sandwiches.
Je les apporterai.
On leur donne à manger
si je peux voir les otages.
Vous êtes volontaire
pour y aller ?
Vous êtes vraiment idiot.
Laisse ça là.
Non, on avait dit
que je verrais les otages.
Toi seul.
- A table !
- Servez-vous !
Pourquoi tes gars les premiers ?
On servira les sandwiches
comme à la cafétéria.
Où sont les otages ?
En rang, messieurs !
Un !
J'ai dit un !
Comment vont ces deux-là ?
Ils devraient être à l'hôpital.
Et les autres ?
Ça va, malgré ces connards.
- Diane ?
- Personne l'a touchée.
Je t'ai parlé ?
Fais gaffe,
tu es que dalle maintenant.
D'autres otages ?
Pas à notre connaissance.
Libérez ces deux-là et Diane.
Il faut qu'on vote.
Mets-toi là.
S'ils sont libérés, je reste.
Trois contre un ?
C'est pas équitable.
Si Mineo et Armstrong meurent,
vous serez responsables.
 Ça peut être la peine de mort.
D'accord.
Les deux s'en vont,
mais Wittlesey reste.
Alors, je marche pas.
Tu saisis pas vraiment
la situation.
On peut te garder aussi.
Me faire prisonnier ?
Et ta parole ?
Nous remplirons
notre part du marché.
Pourquoi ?
Si on leur ment,
on devient comme eux.
Et on n'aura pas nos requêtes.
Laissons partir
Mineo et Armstrong.
Je suis d'accord.
Qui d'autre ? Adebisi ?
Ross ?
Wittlesey reste.
Saïd ?
C'est une lettre de McManus
à Glynn expliquant l'échange.
Voilà nos requêtes.
Au travail !
"Nous voulons parler aux médias
sans censure."
Et pourquoi pas
le journal de 20 h ?
"Les participants à l'émeute
ne subiront pas de représailles."
Ils ont qu'à demander
leur liberté !
La plupart des requêtes
sont raisonnables.
Visites conjugales, cigarettes...
Tout est rejeté. Je ne négocie pas
avec des animaux.
Comment régler la situation ?
Par la bonne vieille méthode :
la force.
Tout ça est de ta faute, McManus !
Ferme-la !
Putain, si je crève,
je veux que le coupable
le sache !
Pourquoi en vouloir à Tim ?
Parce qu'Emerald City,
c'est de la connerie !
Parce que Tim croyait
pouvoir aider ces enfoirés.
Je t'ai vu à l'œuvre.
Je t'ai vu rater
tous tes coups.
J'espère que si on meurt,
tu partiras le premier.
Putain !
Il faut que je parle à Saïd !
Je sais pas...
Je t'en prie !
J'aime qu'on me supplie, McManus.
J'ai grandi dans une petite ville
où la principale industrie
était la prison.
Tout le monde y travaillait
ou gagnait sa vie
avec un motel,
une station-service,
ou - comme mon père - un resto,
juste en face.
C'était l'automne.
On venait de reprendre l'école.
J'allais avoir 10 ans,
alors j'étais tout fier.
Mais juste avant
mon anniversaire,
il y a eu cette émeute.
Ça a duré 4 jours.
Puis le gouverneur
a donné l'autorisation
à 2 500 hommes
d'y mettre bon ordre.
Ça a été fait.
Ils ont tiré
sur tout ce qui bougeait.
Une fois
le gaz lacrymogène dissipé,
on a trouvé 31 détenus
et 9 otages morts.
Attica...
Trois de mes amis
ont perdu leur père.
En guise de fête d'anniversaire,
je suis allé
à une cérémonie du souvenir.
C'est donc ça !
Emerald City,
c'est votre fête d'anniversaire.
Ecoute...
j'ai créé Em City
parce que je voulais
vous offrir un monde meilleur,
à vous tous.
Maintenant,
on est au bord du gouffre,
à la limite du désastre.
Et avant qu'on saute tous,
je voudrais
une 2ème chance.
- C'est pas à moi de la donner.
- Si !
Non !
Même la meilleure prison
ne serait pas assez bien.
Je vais vous expliquer
une fois de plus.
A Oz, les hommes
ne sont pas innocents.
Ils ne sont pas là
pour les délits commis,
mais pour leur couleur de peau,
leur manque d'instruction,
leur pauvreté !
Il ne s'agit pas
d'autoriser la cigarette
ou les visites conjugales.
Ni même de la vie en prison.
Il s'agit de la responsabilité
de la société.
Il s'agit de l'horreur
du système judiciaire !
On n'a pas besoin de prisons
plus grandes ou plus agréables,
mais d'une meilleure justice.
Que pouvez-vous y faire ?
Si on ne règle pas ça,
toi et moi,
et sans tarder,
des gens vont mourir.
Toi, peut-être.
Je suis prêt à donner ma vie
pour que ça change.
Les morts d'Attica ont apporté
de vrais changements,
de vraies réformes.
Mais chacun a oublié les leçons
de votre petite ville.
Il faut à nouveau
réveiller le pays.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Vous voulez sauver cet endroit.
Moi, je veux le détruire,
brique par brique,
car ce n'est qu'hypocrisie.
Attends !
Ouvrez !
Pour l'entrée, ça se passe mal.
Toutes les dix minutes,
gangsters et nazis se battent.
Mets les aryens ailleurs.
Ils refuseront de quitter
le poste de sécurité.
Les latinos
peuvent s'occuper des otages.
Autre chose :
on manque d'héroïne.
- Tant mieux.
- C'est toi qui le dis.
Adebisi et ses potes
sont en manque.
Ça va vite dégénérer.
Quand on en sera là,
je serai prêt.
Tu feras quoi ?
Me laisse pas tomber, Saïd !
Beecher, arrête !
Arif !
Tous à vos postes.
Il me faut de la dope !
Moi aussi, petit frère.
Il y en a sûrement quelque part.
Suivez-moi !
Fouillez partout, prenez
toute la came que vous trouvez !
Vite !
C'est fini !
C'est terminé !
<i>Police !</i>
<i>Ton heure a sonné.</i>
Détenu matricule 93A234,
Simon Adebisi.
Condamné le 2 mai 93
pour homicide volontaire.
Peine : réclusion à perpétuité
sans possibilité de conditionnelle.
Vas-y.
Tue-moi.
Je ne veux pas te tuer.
Je sais, tu veux me sauver.
Oui, je veux te sauver.
Donne-moi de la came !
Putain, file-m'en !
<i>On dit souvent :</i>
<i>"Peu importe de gagner ou perdre,
du moment qu'on joue le jeu."</i>
<i>C'est de la connerie !
Il faut gagner.</i>
<i>C'est le but du jeu.</i>
C'est quoi ?
Le début et la fin, mon frère.
Allez, tout le monde !
Ils vont intervenir.
Amenez les otages.
Détache-moi !
Fallait pas me voler ma montre !
Détache-moi, allez !
Mettez-vous en ligne.
Quand ils arriveront,
vous trinquerez les premiers.
Tes derniers mots ?
Suce-moi.
Si seulement j'avais le temps !
A terre !
Ouvre cette putain de porte !
<i>Peu importe qui vit ou meurt
en prison.</i>
<i>On lit des noms dans le journal,
ils signifient rien pour nous.</i>
Ils ont pas de visage.
On veut pas leur en donner.
On veut pas savoir
qui ils sont.
Ça pourrait tomber
trop près de chez nous.
Et c'est bien de ça
qu'il s'agit, non ?
Avoir un chez-soi où qu'on soit,
qui que l'on soit.
Tout le monde veut un endroit
où se reposer,
où poser sa carcasse.
Même si cet endroit s'appelle Oz.
Comme dit Dorothy
en se réveillant dans son lit,
chez sa tante :
"Rien de tel qu'un chez-soi."
Rien de tel
qu'un putain de chez-soi !

L’INDICE
Saison 2, Episode 1
Oz...
le surnom du pénitentiaire
à sécurité maximale d’Oswald.
Oz, où après des mois de tension,
une émeute a éclaté.
<i>L’unité d’Emerald City est tombée</i>
<i>aux mains des détenus.</i>
<i>Le gouverneur a voulu rétablir l’ordre.</i>
<i>Coûte que coûte.</i>
Une fois la fumée dissipée,
<i>six détenus et deux surveillants
étaient morts.</i>
Il y avait 34 blessés.
<i>Certains à cause des gaz.</i>
<i>D’autres,</i>
des coups.
D’autres, à cause des balles.
Parmi les blessés par balle,
Tim McManus, le créateur
d’Emerald City
et selon certains,
celui qui a mené l’unité
à sa perte.
Les détenus restants
ont rejoint les autres.
Je te tuerai, enculé !
Enfoiré !
Sauf les meneurs de l’émeute,
qu’on a envoyés au trou.
A l’aube,
la paix
avait repris possession d’Oz.
Tu parles !
J’ai commencé à mettre en place
une commission
pour enquêter
sur les causes de l’émeute,
les délits
des détenus impliqués
et la justesse de la réaction
du directeur Glynn.
Qui dirigera la commission ?
J’ai parlé à Alvah Case,
doyen de la faculté de droit.
Il a accepté
de s’en charger.
C’est le juriste
le plus respecté.
Ses conclusions seront justes,
exhaustives et impartiales.
Allez vous faire voir !
J’en demande trop ?
Vous me voulez
dans votre camp.
Vous voulez que je
ferme Emerald City,
que je déclare
les détenus coupables
et que je cautionne
l’intervention des troupes.
Vous voulez vous laver
du sang de ces huit morts.
J’ai la conscience tranquille.
Alors, du vent !
Laissez-moi faire mon travail.
Mais n’oubliez pas une chose.
Mervin Suttel renonce
au poste de procureur.
Je lui cherche un remplaçant.
Entez, on a terminé.
Trouvez la vérité, Case.
C’est de la vérité
que dépend votre salaire.
La vérité !
Où est la vérité, Leo ?
Devlin est-il coupable ?
Et vous ?
Selon ce que je découvre,
Vous risquez de vous faire virer.
Vous me rendriez
un fier service !
Ça gaze, Vern ?
Super !
Encore des tapettes d’Em City !
Tenez-vous à carreaux
avec moi.
Écoutez-moi bien.
ici, c’est ma cellule,
c’est ma piaule.
Ça te dérange ?
Non.
Une souris verte
qui courait dans l’herbe...
Je te parle !
Vous savez ce qui est arrivé
à Dobbins et Vahue ?
Ils sont à l’hôpital ?
J’ai pas pu regarder.
Ta gueule !
Beecher !
Ta gueule !
De la came !
Je l’attrape par la queue,
je la donne...
De la came !
Du calme, mon frère.
M’appelle pas comme ça !
Lâchez-moi !
Mesdames et messieurs, prions.
Veuillez vous lever.
Seigneur,
nous prions
pour les âmes de nos amis,
les agents Hunt et Nowakowski.
Et nous prions pour les âmes
des six détenus morts.
Nous prions
pour le rétablissement
des agents Mineo,
Armonstrong et McManus.
Seigneur,
bénis cet endroit.
Nous avons besoin
de compréhension,
de patience.
Nous avons besoin
de forces pour pardonner.
Nous avons besoin
d’être pardonnés.
<i>Pas de négociations !</i>
<i>On coupe l’eau et l’électricité</i>
<i>et ce soir, on envoie
les gaz lacrymogènes.</i>
<i>Et les otages ?</i>
<i>La brigade d’intervention
s’en chargera.</i>
Ainsi nous pourrons poursuivre
notre mission.
La responsabilité
est une belle chose.
La responsabilité
fait tourner le monde.
Si on peut accuser son voisin,
lui faire porter le chapeau,
on est soulagé
du poids de cette merde.
On peut se coucher
et dormir à poings fermés.
Tu parles !
M. McManus ?
Alvah Case.
Notre grand inquisiteur !
Ce n’est pas une inquisition.
C’est ça !
Devlin veut démanteler Em City
depuis le début.
C’est l’occasion ou jamais.
Leo m’avait prévenu.
Il dit que vos avis divergent.
Mais il admire
votre vision des choses, vos idéaux
Que voulez-vous au juste ?
Vous poser quelques questions.
Je n’ai rien à dire.
Le gouverneur choisit
les membres de la commission.
En attendant,
je fais quelques entretiens.
Je n’ai rien à dire.
Écoutez,
c’est moi qui aurai le dernier mot
sur l’éventuelle réouverture
d’Em City.
Je n’ai rien à dire.
Alvah Case.
Je voudrais vous parler
de l’émeute.
C’est un entretien
ou un interrogatoire ?
Ça dépend
de quoi vous êtes coupable.
Il n’y a pas eu d’émeute.
Vraiment ?
C’était un combat juste
contre la répression.
Juste ou pas,
il y a huit corps
qui pourrissent à la morgue.
Je pleure ces morts.
Vous permettez ?
Je vous en prie.
Depuis votre arrivée à Oz,
vous avez rassemblé
les musulmans,
converti des tueurs
et semé les graines
de la discorde.
Je prêchais la vérité.
Alors, continuez !
Allons, Saïd !
Vous parlez beaucoup de vérité,
mais pourquoi fuir
vos responsabilités ?
Je n’ai pas tiré.
Avez-vous fait en sorte
que d’autres tirent ?
C’est le système judiciaire
qui est en cause.
Votre commission est une imposture.
C’est Devlin,
celui sur qui on devrait enquêter,
qui vous a nommé.
Ça revient à choisir les jurés
à son procès.
Tu veux me lécher les couilles ?
M. Fee
et M. Balling
étudierons les événements
ayant mené à l’émeute.
L’évêque Callahan et M. Didge analyseront
le comportement
des détenus et du personnel.
Mme Eiduson et Dudkey Fried s’occuperont
de l’intervention des troupes.
M. Case,
combien de temps
durera l’enquête ?
Le temps qu’il faudra.
Vous êtes ?
Augustus Hill.
J’ai une question.
Deux détenus ont été évacués.
Eugene Dobbins et Jackson Vahue.
Vous savez
ce qui leur est arrivé ?
C’est moi qui pose les questions.
Prenez le temps de me raconter
ce qui a mené à l’émeute.
Ils sont violents.
Ils ne connaissent que ça.
Les matons nous traitent
comme de la merde.
Parfois, les détenus s’ennuient.
Les visites conjugales
et la cigarette sont interdites.
Il n’y a pas que ça.
On prive un homme de liberté,
d’intimité, de dignité.
Il ne lui reste qu’à mijoter
jusqu’à l’ébullition.
Les musulmans préparaient l’émeute.
Les aryens sont paranos.
<i>L’émeute a été déclenchée
par deux cons</i>
<i>qui jouaient au dames.</i>
Et soudain, le monde a implosé.
Enfoiré de mes deux !
On a bien traité les otages.
On a été maltraités.
On voulait négocier.
Leurs requêtes étaient ridicules.
Puis tout s’est éteint.
Et il y a eu les gaz.
Des armes.
McManus a reçu une balle
dans la poitrine.
J’ai vu la tête de Rodrigo exploser.
Hunt et Nowakowski
ont été touchés au dos.
Et Scott Ross ?
Selon l’autopsie,
il a reçu trois balles.
Une à la tête, une au cœur
et une aux testicules.
C’est bizarre.
Les balles volent
dans tous les sens.
et il en reçoit trois.
A trois endroits précis.
C’est vrai.
<i>Il paraît que la curiosité
est mortelle.</i>
Comment peut-on être curieux
au point d’en mourir ?
<i>Le trou, ça craint.</i>
<i>Si tu aimes la compagnie,
apprends à t’en passer.</i>
Je t’aime !
C’est parfait :
ma prison est bouclée
et grouille
d’enquêteurs et de caméras.
Vous avez peur ?
Toutes ces questions
remuent les choses.
Dieu sait qu’on n’a pas besoin de ça.
Qui était Scott Ross ?
Un motard, un dealer,
condamné trois fois. Pourquoi ?
Ce n’est pas sûr,
mais Ross
a peut-être été assassiné.
Il a peut-être été tué délibérément.
Pourquoi dites-vous ça ?
On lui a tiré 3 fois dessus,
une vraie exécution,
et les balles qui ont tué Ross
étaient du 9 mm,
ce n’est pas ce qu’utilise
la brigade d’intervention.
La brigade a du 9 mm
pour les pistolets.
Un membre de la brigade
arrive à Em City.
Ross débarque et le type fait feu.
Ce n’est pas un meurtre.
Avec une balle dans la tête,
le mec est sensé être mort.
Il a d’abord visé le cœur
ou les couilles !
La balle
qui a touché Ross au cerveau
était dans le mur
près d’un poste de télé
et celle qui l’a touché au cœur,
dans le sol. Alors, à moins
de tomber en l’air...
C’est un meurtre.
<i>Dans ce chaos,</i>
<i>c’était facile
de supprimer Ross en douce.</i>
<i>Adieu Scott !</i>
C’est lui.
Agent Heim.
Les balles qui ont tué Ross
proviennent de la même boîte
que celles de votre pistolet.
Et alors ?
Votre pistolet a servi à tuer Ross.
Vous n’en parlez pas
dans votre rapport.
Ce n’est pas moi.
Alors, qui ?
Je ne sais pas.
Vous avez prêté votre pistolet ?
Était-il dans son étui
à votre arrivée ?
Et ensuite ?
Il a disparu.
Vous avez senti
qu’on vous le prenait ?
C’était la panique.
Tout s’est passé très vite.
Vous dites donc
que quelqu’un a sorti
votre pistolet de son étui
à votre insu.
Exact.
Pourquoi ne pas en avoir parlé
dans votre rapport ?
Parce que je l’ai retrouvé par terre.
Est-ce que vous me prenez
pour un crétin complet ?
Alors, arrêtez vos conneries !
Vous aimez plus les armes
que les chattes !
Nul ne pourrait
prendre votre pistolet.
Vous savez sûrement
comment il a disparu.
Qui est-ce que vous couvrez ?
Scott Ross était une ordure minable,
comme toutes ces autres ordures ici.
Ils ont blessé Armstrong et Mineo.
A cause d’eux,
Hunt et Nowakowski sont morts.
Vous harcelez un agent
parce que Ross s’est fait buter ?
De quel côté êtes-vous ?
Celui de la loi.
Je suis du côté de la loi.
Vous pouvez partir maintenant.
Merci.
Je ne mens jamais.
Pas parce que je suis honnête.
Mais je n’ai pas de mémoire.
On ment mal
si on a pas de mémoire.
Wangler, ça va ?
Il me faut de la dope.
C’est la dernière chose qu’il te faut.
Réveille-toi.
Lève-toi.
Suce-moi.
Allez, suce-moi.
Suce-moi, tapette.
Je t’emmerde !
Lève-toi.
Qu’est-ce que tu attends ?
Vas-y, salope.
Des pansements !
Toujours au boulot ?
Vous aussi.
On a eu quelques incidents
ce soir.
Ça pourrait m’intéresser ?
Que faites-vous ici ?
J’essaie d’éclaircir l’affaire Ross.
Il restait 6 otages
quand la brigade
est intervenue.
McManus, Wittlesey, Mukada,
D’Agnasti, Hunt et Nowakowski.
Hunt et Nowakowski sont morts
au tout début de l’assaut.
McManus a été blessé.
Il n’a donc pas pu tuer Ross.
Pourquoi un agent
et pas un prisonnier ?
Ross était mal vu par les détenus.
J’ai d’abord pensé
que quelqu’un avait voulu
se venger de lui.
Mais j’ai parlé avec Heim,
qui d’ailleurs m’a menti
effrontément.
Il ne couvrirait pas un détenu.
Il protège un des siens.
D’Agnasti.
Ou Wittlesey.
Ou Mukada.
Alvah, arrêtez !
Le père Mukada n’est pas mêlé à ça.
On ne sait jamais.
Comment se comportait Ross ?
C’était un petit con méprisant.
Il vous a blessé personnellement,
physiquement ?
Et Wittlesey et D’Agnasti ?
Je ne m’en souviens pas.
J’ai été pas mal tabassé et j’étais...
terrifié.
Vous vous rappelez autre chose ?
J’avais le nez qui me démangeait.
Mais avec les mains liées,
impossible de me gratter.
Mettez-vous en ligne.
Vous morflerez les premiers.
Malgré les gaz lacrymo,
les coups de feu,
la peur et la montée d’adrénaline,
je ne pensais qu’à une chose :
"Qui pourrait me gratter le nez ?"
- Ta gueule !
- Je t’emmerde !
Des nouvelles
de Dobbins et Vahue ?
D’Agnasti !
Je vous pose une question.
Connard de junkie,
boucle-la ou je te tabasse !
D’Agnasti !
J’ai à vous parler.
Je travaille.
Ça ne sera pas long.
Tous les otages étaient attachés ?
les mains derrière le dos.
Jusqu’à quel moment ?
Après la fin de la fusillade.
Qui vous a attaché ?
Scott Ross.
Du calme, Wangler !
Vous n’aimiez pas Ross.
Pourquoi je l’aurais aimé ?
Ta gueule !
C’est plutôt calme.
Par rapport à Em City,
c’est plutôt calme.
Je peux vous aider ?
Je viens voir mon mari, Billy Kempf.
La prison est bouclée.
Sûrement pas !
J’ai fait 503 km.
Je dois voir Billy Kempf aujourd’hui.
Vous avez entendu parler de l’émeute ?
Oui, mais je sais que c’est fini.
- En effet.
- Laissez-moi voir Billy.
Pas aujourd’hui.
Vous pigez pas.
- Je peux faire autre chose ?
- Ouvrez !
Je peux faire autre chose ?
Pour qui vous vous prenez ?
Vous déconnez !
Ça n’est pas si calme que ça.
Que s’est-il passé
à l’arrivée de la brigade d’intervention ?
Je l’ai déjà dit.
Je sais. Comme un idiot,
j’ai perdu mon carnet.
Avec les gaz lacrymo, on voyait mal.
McManus et moi, on s’est planqués.
On a entendu des coups de feu
pendant longtemps,
puis le silence.
On a cru que c’était fini.
Puis on a tiré sur Tim.
Il est tombé à terre ?
Et vous ?
Je l’ai tenu dans mes bras
en attendant les secours.
Quel genre de détenu était Ross ?
Quel genre ?
Modèle, agitateur ?
Normal.
Toi et moi,
on est liés à la vie, à la mort.
Tu peux rien y faire.
Merci.
<i>Tout le monde dit
que c’est mal de mentir</i>
<i>et pourtant,</i>
tout le monde ment.
On sait tous que les mensonges
sont nécessaires.
- Je leur ai parlé.
- Et alors ?
Tim va sortir de l’hôpital.
J’ai honte. Je ne suis allée
le voir qu’une fois.
Ce Case,
il vous a parlé ?
- Oui, hier.
- Moi aussi.
Il a parlé de moi ?
Pas spécialement.
Ça va ?
Comment va Dobbins ?
Il est mort, mon vieux.
Putain !
Vous voilà !
Vous me cherchiez ?
Partout.
Qu’est-ce que vous faisiez ?
J’étudiais l’hypothèse du meurtre.
Laissez tomber.
Ne vous embarrassez pas
de choses pareilles.
Vous vous trompez
de direction.
Ce sont les règles du jeu.
Avec ce sédatif, Adebisi est K.O.
pour quelques heures.
Une pause ne me ferait pas de mal.
Et vous,
vous n’arrêtez jamais ?
Bien sûr que si.
Je peux vous offrir un café ?
Je ne pense pas.
Pourquoi ?
Vous me rendez nerveuse.
Moi ?
Il n’y a pas plus gentil.
Demandez à ma mère.
Si on prenait un café ensemble,
je ne saurais pas
si vous m’interrogez ou si...
Dr Nathan, je vous jure
que je ne suis pas si pervers.
Je suis prof d’université !
Je donne des cours.
Vous formez des avocats.
Je me contenterai
de poser des questions.
M. Robson, votre gland
a été sectionné.
Tu t’es fait couper la bite.
Bite coupée !
Ça fait quoi ?
C’est bizarre.
Encore un junkie qui déjante !
Du calme !
La réprobation de l’usage
de la force à Oswald
persiste malgré la commission
qui enquête.
Aidez-moi.
Pourquoi c’est si long ?
Je dois travailler
bien ou vite ?
Les deux.
Donnez une échéance à la presse.
J’en ai marre de leur dire
d’être patients
et de prétendre
avoir confiance en vous.
Ça irait plus vite si Alvah
s’occupait du principal.
Comment ça ?
Il essaie d’élucider un meurtre.
Si c’en est un,
ce n’est qu’une partie
de la mission.
Non, c’est indissociable
de tout le problème d’Oz.
Quelles conneries !
Étant donné
vos trois dernières décisions,
c’est vous, l’expert
en conneries.
Laissez tomber !
Je démissionne.
Non, c’est moi.
Personne ne démissionne.
La commission doit rester unie.
Finie la bagarre
et au boulot.
Plus vite ce sera réglé,
mieux ça vaudra.
Fais de beaux rêves, enfoiré.
Dr Nathan !
La dernière fois qu’une femme
m’a attaché comme ça,
je l’ai épousée.
Elle vous aurait gardé comme ça,
vous seriez encore mariés.
Je me sens bien.
Je peux sortir.
Non. D’abord,
sœur Marie, vous et moi
devons discuter.
Docteur, je bande. C’est bien ?
A vous de me le dire.
Que cherchez-vous ?
Vos impressions sur Ross.
Vous êtes professeur ?
Je l’étais.
Depuis que je suis doyen,
je donne peu de cours.
Parfois, les professeurs
ont des élèves
préférés...
Je ne supportais pas Ross.
Il vous faisait peur ?
D’une part.
Il avait aussi
un problème d’hygiène.
A-t-il déjà parlé
d’une liaison
avec un membre du personnel ?
Il disait beaucoup de choses,
c’était un menteur invétéré.
Vous recevez
les membres du personnel ?
Quelqu’un a déjà parlé
de Ross en mal ?
Bien sûr.
Qui ça ?
Tout le monde.
Soyez plus précise.
Une religieuse
sait garder une confidence.
Vous n’êtes pas prêtre.
Le secret de la confession
ne s’applique pas à vous.
En tant que psychologue, si.
Ce sera peut-être au tribunal
d’en décider.
Très bien.
Vous me rendrez les dossiers.
Autre chose ?
Ryan O’Reilly.
C’est moi !
Homicide involontaire,
mise en danger de la vie d’autrui,
détention de drogue,
détention d’arme,
conditionnelle révoquée...
Quel liste de délits !
J’ai fait de mon mieux.
Malgré tous ces talents,
ça a dû être dur
de vous adapter à Oz.
Je sais me débrouiller.
Je vois ça.
Mais comment ?
Je connais toutes les ficelles.
J’en suis sûr.
Vous étiez
le seul meneur de l’émeute
sans puissance de feu.
Mais vous participiez
à la prise de décision.
Je ne suis pas mêlé à l’émeute.
J’ai dû être mal informé.
Sans doute.
D’après une source
que je pensais fiable,
Ross et vous
étiez proches.
Proches ? Non.
On dit que vous étiez amants.
Qui vous a dit ces conneries ?
Ross s’est confié
à sœur Peter Marie.
Je ne suis pas pédé
et si je l’étais,
j’approcherais pas ma bite
du cul de Ross.
Ce con baiserait n’importe quoi.
Et les agents ?
Ross en a déjà baisé ?
Aidez-moi à sortir.
Désolé.
Vous n’irez nulle part
avant la fin de l’enquête.
Vous auriez une cigarette ?
C’est bon.
Quand j’aurais tiré là-dessus,
je pourrai fumer mes mégots.
Alors ?
Il en pinçait pour Wittlesey.
Il disait
qu’ils s’étaient connus dehors.
ils parlaient toujours ensemble.
Qu’est-ce qu’il y a ?
Case me fout la trouille.
Pourquoi ?
Tu n’as pas à t’en faire.
Après son enquête,
il disparaîtra.
Pas vrai ?
Sûrement
<i>On dit aussi</i>
que si on répète souvent
un mensonge,
ça devient la vérité.
Du moins, on se persuade
que c’est parole d’évangile.
Vous êtes le chef des aryens,
M. Schillinger ?
- Je l’étais.
- La conditionnelle approche.
Vous avez une chance de sortir ?
Je l’espère.
Mes fils ont besoin de moi.
Je pourrais vous faire
une lettre de recommandation.
Si je vous aide.
Exact.
Scott Ross.
Pauvre mec !
Vous étiez amis ?
Il avait parlé
de relations sexuelles
avec l’agent Wittlesey ?
Bien sûr.
Ross et l’ex de Wittlesey
étaient motards.
Il prétendait l’avoir sautée
dans le dos de son mari.
Mais Ross disait
beaucoup de conneries.
Qui sait si c’est vrai ?
Il y avait quelque chose
entre eux
depuis son arrivée à Oz ?
D’après Ross,
il se la tapait souvent.
Vous pensez qu’il mentait ?
Possible.
Merci de me laisser venir
à la bibliothèque.
On s’ennuie dans rien à lire.
C’est normal.
On dit que vous savez
tout ce qui se passe à Oz.
C’est exagéré.
Vous savez s’il y avait
quoi que ce soit
entre Wittlesey et Ross ?
Des cigarettes.
Pardon ?
Entre eux,
il y avait des cigarettes.
Wittlesey les apportait
et Ross les vendait.
Mais McManus a tout découvert.
Il a demandé à Wittlesey d’arrêter.
Ross détestait McManus
à cause de ça.
Et parce que McManus
couchait avec Wittlesey.
Vous avez une cigarette ?
Mais non, Ross est mort !
C’est drôle,
ce qu’un borgne peut voir
dans l’obscurité
et malgré les gaz lacrymo.
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
J’ai rien dit
à ce nègre de Case.
Qu’attendez-vous de moi ?
Ma conditionnelle approche.
Le mieux pour vous,
ce serait que je sorte d’ici.
Wittlesey aurait tué Ross ?
Elle avait un mobile et une occasion.
Je connais Diane. Ne parlez pas
de mobile et d’occasion.
Je veux des preuves.
Pendant l’émeute,
elle a perdu la tête.
Trouvez une meilleure raison.
Ross a dû faire quelque chose
pour l’inciter à tirer.
Un détenu
demande à vous parler.
Lequel ?
Tobias Beecher.
Salut, chef !
Vous vouliez me voir.
J’ai un secret.
A quel sujet ?
Scott Ross.
Dites-le-moi.
Alors, ça ne sera plus un secret.
Laissez-nous.
J’ai arraché le gland d’un type.
Il paraît.
Vous n’avez pas peur ?
Mon pantalon n’est pas baissé.
J’étais avocat. Vous le saviez ?
Je suis allé à Harvard.
Moi aussi.
Bravo, collègue !
J’ai été très stressé récemment.
J’ai fait des bêtises.
Cette morsure, par exemple.
Mais je profite
de mon séjour ici
pour me ressaisir.
En sortant, je veux être
quelqu’un de meilleur.
Parce que cette morsure,
c’est pas bien...
Pour prouver ma bonne volonté,
je vais vous dire mon secret.
Comme ça, je reprendrai
le droit chemin, non ?
J’ai vu tirer les coups de feu.
Lesquels ?
Examinez les balles.
Celles qui ont tué Ross ?
Non, examinez celles
qui ont touché McManus.
McManus n’a pas reçu de balles
d’un membre de la brigade.
Les striations prouvent
qu’il a été blessé
par un Glock ou un Sig-Sauer.
Il y avait bien un Sig-Sauer
pendant l’émeute.
À qui était-il ?
Kareem Saïd.
Vous avez tiré sur McManus.
- Non.
- Alors, qui l’a fait ?
Je ne sais pas.
Vous aviez un Sig-Sauer.
Pour dire oui,
il faudrait que je sois idiot !
Vous êtes bien ici, Saïd ?
Parce que la fin de votre régime
cellulaire dépend de moi.
Vous aimez être
parmi les vôtres,
pour les guider, les éduquer.
Ça va être dur,
à travers 8 tonnes d’acier.
Vous êtes universitaire, non ?
Vous connaissez
les hypothèses et les théories ?
Théoriquement parlant,
si j’avais été armé
à l’arrivée de la brigade...
j’aurais pu me trouver
sous le tableau de contrôle.
Un agent serait entré
et m’aurait frappé.
Ne voulant tuer personne,
j’aurais jeté mon arme.
Et quelqu’un l’aurait ramassée ?
Théoriquement parlant, oui.
Vous n’avez rien à me dire,
mais moi si.
D’abord, vous avez des couilles.
Vous êtes allé à Em City
pour négocier la libération
des agents blessés.
Vous avez pris la place
d’Armstrong et Mineo,
vous mettant dans une situation
de quitte ou double.
Surtout en sachant
que vous tomberiez
aux mains de Scott Ross,
un homme que méprisiez.
Quelle ironie
qu’il vous ait tiré dessus !
<i>Tes derniers mots ?</i>
Suce-moi.
Qui vous a dit ça ?
Que Ross vous avait tiré dessus ?
Vous venez de le faire.
Vous savez,
Oz est un endroit
comme un autre.
Tout le monde adore raconter
des ragots sur les autres.
Pas moi.
Mais on parle de vous.
Peut-être
parce qu’il y a peu de femmes.
Peut-être parce qu’il y a du vrai
dans les rumeurs.
Par exemple,
que vous faisiez passer des cigarettes
à Ross pour qu’il les vende
et que vous aviez une liaison
avec McManus.
Vous m’accusez
de quelque chose ?
En effet.
Vous avez tué Scott Ross.
Moi ? Mais comment ?
Ross a ramassé l’arme de Saïd.
Il a tiré sur McManus.
Vous avez pris l’arme de Heim
et tué Ross.
Impossible, j’avais les mains liées.
Non.
Vous aviez réussi à vous détacher.
Vous avez dit,
quand McManus est tombé,
« je l’ai tenu dans mes bras. »
Fin de citation.
Comment faire avec les mains
attachées derrière le dos ?
Vous avez déjà vécu ça ?
Vous ne pouvez pas comprendre.
Le fait d’être otage,
l’état d’esprit des détenus.
On cesse d’être humain,
on est dans une autre dimension.
J’ai commis toutes les fautes possibles.
Je suis tombée amoureuse
du mauvais homme.
J’ai eu un enfant hors mariage.
J’ai trop bu, j’ai trop sniffé.
J’ai fait ce boulot pour l’argent
et j’appréhendais de me lever.
Mais j’ai toujours choisi.
J’ai choisi de boire,
j’ai choisi d’arrêter.
J’ai choisi de quitter un mari violent.
Je refuse d’être victime de quelqu’un.
Ces erreurs commises
font partie de moi.
Et je ne regrette rien.
Vous comprenez ?
Ni regrets ni regards.
Je poursuis ma route.
Qu’allez-vous faire ?
Je vous le dirai quand je le saurai.
<i>Elle a une petite fille</i>
et une mère malade.
Et alors, Leo ?
Si vous dévoilez la vérité,
vous détruisez cette femme et sa fille.
Et pour quoi ?
Pour ce con de Ross !
Que voulez-vous que je dise ?
Que Ross est mort comme les autres,
des balles des hommes
de la brigade d’intervention.
J’ai lu votre rapport.
Vous ne voulez pas poursuivre
Saïd et les autres meneurs ?
Juridiquement,
les preuves sont indirectes.
Moralement, c’est risible.
Je veux que ces salauds
soient jugés à la télé.
Pour moi, tout ce qu’ils ont fait
découle de vos actions à vous.
Vous m’avez innocenté.
Votre commission
a été bien sage.
Mais si les détenus sont coupables,
vous aussi.
Je n’attends pas ce comportement
de la part d’un procureur.
J’y ai réfléchi.
Je ne veux pas être procureur.
Je veux être gouverneur.
Quoi ?
On se verra pendant la campagne.
J’ai une conférence de presse à donner.
Selon cette commission,
même si l’émeute
et les morts qui en résultent
sont tragiques,
personne en particulier
n’est responsable.
Selon nous, certaines mesures
peuvent être prises
pour éviter qu’un événement semblable
ne se reproduise.
Salope !
<i>Au bout du compte,</i>
<i>personne n’était responsable de l’émeute.</i>
<i>Ça signifiait donc
qu’il s’était passé rien de mal.</i>
<i>Il s’était rien passé du tout.</i>
<i>Alors, la vie peut continuer
comme avant...</i>
Tu parles !

Transcript : Camouille pour Forom
TRIBUS ANCESTRALES
Saison 2, Episode 2
Il y avait une tribu, les Aztèques,
qui croyait que l'univers
était né de la violence.
Au moment de leur équivalent de Noël,
ils offraient le cœur
de l'un d'eux aux dieux.
<i>Ils pensaient que sans ce sacrifice,</i>
<i>le soleil tomberait du ciel</i>
et que ce serait la fin du monde.
<i>Puis les Espagnols</i>
<i>ont exterminé les Aztèques.</i>
En fait, ils avaient raison.
<i>C'était bien la fin du monde...
pour eux.</i>
<i>Bienvenue à Oz,</i>
<i>10 mois après la fin du monde.</i>
Beaucoup de gens pensaient
qu'Em City ne rouvrirait jamais.
Mais après presque un an,
de combines politiques, d'emmerdes
et le soutient du directeur,
nous voici !
La donne a changé.
C'est une meilleure donne, plus juste.
J'ai maintenant identifié dix groupes :
les musulmans, les gangsters,
les Latinos, les Italiens,
les Irlandais,
les aryens, les motards, les chrétiens,
les homos et les Autres.
Quatre détenus de chaque groupe
vivront à Em City.
Tous les groupes
et les individus seront égaux.
N'importe quoi !
Pas du tout.
Et pour garantir ça,
je forme un comité
qui recevra les doléances
et me conseillera.
Chaque groupe aura
un représentant dans le comité.
Des questions ?
Malgré tout ce qui est arrivé,
pourquoi êtes-vous revenu ?
Pourquoi croyez-vous toujours
à Em City ?
Voilà la vérité.
Soit on change,
soit on refait les mêmes erreurs.
Soit on s'intègre à sa communauté,
soit on reste à l'écart.
Dans chaque cas, la réussite
de notre vie dépend de nous.
Le succès d'Em City
ne dépend pas que de moi.
Mais aussi de vous.
D'autres questions ?
Représente-nous au conseil.
Si jamais on y participe.
Tu veux pas ?
Mieux vaut attendre.
L'absence peut en dire plus
que la présence.
D'abord, on recommence à dealer.
Et O'Reilly ?
Je m'occupe de lui.
Je m'occupe d'Adebisi.
Ce sont les Siciliens qui m'inquiètent.
Nino Scibetta est pas là.
Il est mort.
C'est son fils qui nous emmerde.
On va reprendre le trafic de came,
découvrir qui a tué mon père et...
Les autres enfoirés
vont devoir comprendre
qu'il faut plus nous traiter
comme de la merde.
Pourquoi je suis un Autre ?
J'étais dealer.
Je suis un gangster !
J'ai tué un flic !
Je devrais être avec vous !
Tu es handicapé.
Et vous, vous êtes cinglés.
Qui es-tu ?
Agamemnon Busmalis, dit "la Taupe".
- La Taupe ?
- Je creuse.
Je creuse partout.
Je sortirai d'Oz en creusant.
Ma place n'est pas avec ces malades.
Ils sont fous. Surtout Beecher.
En plus de ce qu'il a fait
à Schillinger,
Il a mordu la bite d'un mec.
C'était il y a 10 mois.
Alors, ça va.
Avec lui, je dormirai que d'un œil.
Sœur Peter Marie trouve qu'il progresse.
Qu'elle partage sa cellule !
Le comité d'Em City
se réunit pour la première fois.
Il faut un secrétaire de séance.
Quelqu'un sait écrire ?
Je suis doué pour la calligraphie.
Tiens. Attention.
Beaucoup d'entre vous
ont un passé difficile :
parents violents, logement pourri,
pas de boulot.
Mon but est de vous donner à tous
l'occasion de changer de vie.
Et comment ?
Par l'instruction.
La majorité
d'entre vous n'a pas fait d'études.
Le système pénitentiaire
a des programmes éducatifs
depuis 1982.
On les appliquera ici.
- Ça existe déjà.
- Ce sera obligatoire.
Ce qu'on veut, c'est la reprise
des visites conjugales !
Et les clopes ?
Une chose à la fois.
D'abord, l'instruction.
On va avoir plus d'élèves,
donc il nous faudra plus de profs.
Notre budget étant limité, je demande
des volontaires.
O'Reilly ?
Coushaine, je sais
que tu as enseigné, brièvement.
Si tu nous aidais ?
Fayot !
Saïd, il n'y avait pas
de musulmans au comité !
Si le comité a vraiment du pouvoir,
on participera.
Comment ça ?
On prend des décisions
ou on approuve les vôtres ?
La prison,
c'est pas la démocratie.
Je ne le sais que trop.
Je veux vraiment donner
une seconde chance aux détenus.
Si ça t'intéresse pas,
ne m'en empêche pas.
McManus, qu'on soit alliés
est impossible.
Transférez-moi ailleurs
et vous serez débarrassé de moi.
Quand j'étais alité à l'hôpital,
j'ai eu peur de mourir.
J'ai prié.
J'ai pas eu de révélation,
mais j'ai compris que mon dieu
et le tien se ressemblaient.
Ils veulent le meilleur de nous.
et qu'on trouve le meilleur des autres.
Mon nouveau livre
sort le mois prochain.
Il parle de l'émeute.
En l'écrivant,
j'ai cherché le meilleur en vous.
Vous savez ce que j'ai trouvé ?
Un petit bonhomme perturbé qui a peur.
J'avais peur, j'étais perturbé.
Mais une balle dans la poitrine,
ça t'ouvre les yeux.
Les gens peuvent changer, Saïd.
Même moi.
Même toi.
McManus, vous salopez le sol !
Putain, je vais devoir recommencer !
Tu as laissé tomber les cours.
Ça me faisait chier.
Tu préfères nettoyer ?
Je préfère m'éclater
avec des meufs, mais je peux pas !
En sortant, comment tu trouveras
du boulot sans instruction ?
J'aurai du boulot.
Il y a des gens
qui s'occuperont de moi.
Tu dealeras ?
- Vous voulez quoi ?
- Un marché.
Au lieu de ça,
tu passes ton diplôme.
Tu termines le lycée.
C'est simple :
école ou travail. Choisis.
Plus de serpillière ?
Je vais y réfléchir.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je travaille sur un poème.
Un poème ?
Il est pas encore fini.
Et le texte ?
Là-dedans.
Tu l'écris pas ?
C'est plus facile comme ça.
Et si tu me le lisais ?
Faut pas que je m'approche
de ces motels à cafards.
Nous, les cafards,
on est là depuis le début.
Malgré ces constructeurs de motels
à la con,
je me ferai jamais prendre.
Je suis pas du genre
à m'éloigner du nid.
Faut que je mette la sourdine,
que je fasse gaffe.
<i>Détenu matricule 96J332,
Arnold Jackson,</i>
<i>dit "le Poète".</i>
<i>Condamné le 15 février 96</i>
<i>pour vol,
tentative de meurtre,</i>
<i>détention d'arme.</i>
<i>Peine : 16 ans.</i>
<i>Conditionnelle au bout de 9 ans.</i>
Je veux que tu assistes aux cours.
C'est pas mon truc !
Je veux que tu aies un diplôme.
Rien à foutre !
Attends.
Ecoute-moi.
Si tu vas en cours,
je te laisserai avoir
une visite conjugale.
Je suis pas marié !
Tu as une copine ?
Si tu vas en cours
et que tu as ton diplôme,
tu pourras la voir une fois.
Il y a pas de règlement pour ça ?
On s'en fout !
Ça marche ?
D'accord.
On va se concentrer sur la lecture
et la grammaire
pour évaluer votre niveau.
Commençons par lire à voix haute.
Un volontaire ?
Kenny ?
Lis le premier paragraphe
de la première page.
Pourquoi je lirais ce truc ?
Si un mot vous échappe,
on fera une liste de vocabulaire.
Voilà le 1er mot : vocabulaire.
Qui sait ce que le mot
"vocabulaire" signifie ?
C'est une maladie ?
C'est ce que tu as !
Un vocabulaire ramolli !
Toi, tu en as même pas !
C'est une liste de mots.
Le mot "vocabulaire"
peut être ajouté
à notre vocabulaire.
Allons-y, Kenny.
Cet Irlandais de merde n'a qu'à lire !
Vas-y d'abord.
J'ai dit non !
Lis la première page.
Tu es sourd ? J'ai dit non !
Que s'est-il passé ?
Il a voulu m'étrangler.
- Il me faisait chier.
- Mais non !
J'appelle un médecin ?
Comment c'est arrivé ?
Je voulais seulement qu'il lise.
- Ferme-la !
- C'est vrai.
Dans mon bureau.
Pourquoi tu as fait ça ?
Il m'emmerdait !
N'importe quoi.
Selon notre accord,
tu devais obéir au prof.
Je suis la tapette de personne.
Lis.
Je t'écoute.
Regarde !
Alors ?
McDonald.
Ramenez-le dans sa cellule.
Wangler ira au trou.
Wangler ne sait pas lire.
Il sait pas lire du tout !
Ça excuse son attitude ?
Non, mais on peut l'aider.
Tu vas lui apprendre à lire ?
Il y a 150 ans,
alphabétiser un esclave
était illégal.
Mais certains l'ont fait,
par soif d'apprendre.
Le contraire est vrai.
On ne peut pas forcer
quelqu'un à apprendre.
Je peux essayer.
Les Aztèques avaient un roi :
Moctezuma II.
Un nom à coucher dehors !
Une nuit, Moctezuma a vu
<i>un épi de maïs en feu
traverser le ciel...</i>
<i>une comète.</i>
<i>Pour Moctezuma,
c'était un présage,</i>
<i>le signe de sa chute.</i>
<i>Et il a abandonné son empire
aux Espagnols</i>
<i>sans se battre.</i>
Assieds-toi.
Quel con !
Il faut se battre,
même si on est sûr de perdre.
Tu connais ?
"Méthode de lecture."
Putain !
Leçon numéro un.
C'est de la merde de rat.
Un putain de gros rat ! Sens.
Ne me mets pas ça sous le nez !
On va éliminer ces parasites
avec des pièges.
Impossible.
Les rats et les cafards
finiront par envahir la planète.
Magnez-vous !
Ça va, on arrive.
Qui est l'abruti qui cuisine ?
Je ne suis pas un abruti.
Tu as un problème ?
Oui, la bouffe est nulle.
Ne mange pas.
Ça va changer.
- Qui a décidé ça ?
- Peter Scibetta.
- Qui ?
- Je parle à l'Irlandais.
Peter reprend la cuisine.
D'accord, s'il me suce la bite.
Fais gaffe ou tu auras plus rien
à faire sucer.
Tu crois qu'ils savent
qu'on a tué Nino ?
On s'en fout !
Je m'occuperai d'eux
comme de Nino.
Où tu vas ?
J'ai à te parler de ton père.
Tu sais quoi sur mon père ?
Comment il est mort,
qui l'a tué.
- Qui ?
- Adebisi.
Qui ça ?
L'abruti de la cuisine.
Il a mis du verre dans sa bouffe.
Comment tu le sais ?
Je l'ai vu faire.
Et je lui ai mis du verre
dans sa bouffe.
Tiens-le.
Tu as tué mon père ?
Menteur !
C'est Adebisi.
Je voulais tuer Adebisi.
C'est un malade,
il sniffe tout ce qu'il trouve.
J'ai aidé ton père.
On pourrait collaborer.
Lâche-le.
S'il a tué mon père,
je m'occuperai de lui.
Maintenant, je dois m'entraîner.
Je veux que tu saches
que tu peux compter sur moi.
J'avais compris.
Tu le crois ?
Les rats savent
quand quitter le navire.
Il est malin,
mais c'est un rat.
Surveille-le.
<i>Détenu matricule 98S112,
Peter Scibetta.</i>
<i>Condamné le 19 mai 98.</i>
<i>Extorsion et blanchiment d'argent.</i>
<i>Peine : 35 ans.</i>
<i>Conditionnelle au bout de 20 ans.</i>
C'est ouvert.
Merci.
Je reste ou je sors ?
Sortez.
Assieds-toi.
Vous êtes inaccessible.
Comment ça ?
En trois semaines,
on s'était pas encore vus.
Que veux-tu ?
Renvoyez-moi l'ascenseur.
C'est-à-dire ?
Je veux m'occuper de la cuisine.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que je le veux.
Ça marche comme ça.
Non, ça ne marche pas comme ça.
Ici, c'est ma prison.
C'est toi qui m'obéis.
C'est facile. Il suffit
que je passe un coup de fil.
Je sais.
Ton père était un homme respectable.
On s'entendait bien.
Jamais il ne m'aurait joué ce tour.
Mon père vivait selon
un code d'honneur qui a disparu.
Un code d'honneur qui l'a tué.
J'agis à ma façon.
Je vous demande un service
et vous m'en devez un.
Alors ?
D'accord,
tu t'occuperas de la cuisine.
- Merci Leo.
- M. Glynn !
Ce sera tout.
Agent Armstrong !
Où est ce couteau ?
Peter Scibetta
va s'occuper de la cuisine.
Pourquoi avoir choisi ce nul ?
C'est comme ça.
D'accord.
Mais dites un truc à ce nul
de ma part.
On a des rats.
Je vais enlever le pansement.
L'intervention a réussi.
Vous aurez une cicatrice,
mais vous verrez
presque comme avant.
Dites-moi si ça fait mal.
Ouvrez l'œil.
Vous y voyez ?
Parfait.
Allons boire un martini.
Comment ?
Quand j'étais avocat,
après une longue journée,
on allait tous chez MacSwagging
prendre un martini vodka
avec une olive.
Ça me ferait du bien maintenant !
L'abus d'alcool vous a mené ici.
Le dossier de Schillinger est prêt ?
Tim et moi, on doit le lire.
Pas encore. Un autre jour ?
Sortez le dossier Schillinger.
Je vais aux toilettes.
Elle te laisse seul ici ?
Vous croyez que je vais lancer
une émeute, prendre des otages ?
Tu délires.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je les ai foutus dehors.
Tes sales gosses sont dingues.
Toujours défoncés !
Et ils me volent !
Où ils sont ?
On s'en fout !
Ecoute-moi, vieux con,
retrouve mes fils !
Pour qu'ils viennent à Oz
te parler à cœur ouvert ?
Reste ici, enfoiré !
Putain, reviens, papa !
Retrouve mes fils !
Mon petit Vern !
Je savais
que tu aurais une marque.
<i>Tu lis quoi ? Mein Kampf ?</i>
Je vais te raconter la fin.
Les aryens
se sont pris une raclée !
Moi aussi, je lis.
Dans ton dossier,
selon sœur Peter Marie,
tu fais preuve
"de grandes qualités d'adaptation".
Tu parles !
Tu penses à ta conditionnelle !
Je veillerai
à ce que tu sortes jamais.
Tu entends, mon chou ?
Jamais !
Aide-moi.
Comment ?
Tue Beecher.
Ce fumier est taré.
Le buter,
c'est un sacré service !
C'est pas un service,
mais un boulot. Je paierai.
Pas question !
Mark ?
Pas question.
Quelqu'un ?
Gonzesses !
Va te faire voir !
Tue-le toi-même.
J'aimerais bien pouvoir.
J'ai du boulot pour tes gars.
Ça dépend quoi.
Je veux faire tuer Beecher.
Des tas de crétins accepteraient.
Toi ?
Je suis pas un crétin.
Essaie les Latinos.
Je croyais
que tu te foutais des Latinos.
Tu buteras Beecher ou pas ?
En échange de quoi ?
Je m'occupe du courrier.
Je peux faire entrer ou sortir
ce que tu veux.
De la dope ?
Bien sûr.
Je te croyais contre.
Tu peux faire passer des tacos
du moment que Beecher crève !
Quoi d'autre ?
Comment ça ?
La boîte aux lettres, c'est bien,
mais ça suffit pas.
Je veux tout ce que tu as.
Enculé de Latino !
Voilà le Schillinger
que je connais.
<i>Fous-moi le camp, mon pote !</i>
Fous-moi la paix.
Les ordinateurs distinguent pas
le vrai du faux.
On appuie sur une touche,
ils obéissent. Pas comme les gens.
Fous-moi la paix.
Tu devrais m'écouter.
Par mon boulot, j'ai accès
à tous les dossiers de la prison.
Je peux les modifier,
supprimer des délits,
en rajouter.
Pareil pour ton dossier
qui va être étudié.
Fous-moi la paix !
Un problème ?
C'est lui le problème !
Alors, pourquoi c'est toi qui cries ?
Sors.
C'est un parasite.
Vous êtes tous des parasites.
Et vous ?
Comment ça ?
Je vous l'ai dit,
j'ai tout vu.
Vous avez tiré sur Ross.
Continue à avancer.
Je sais aussi,
pour votre fille et votre mère.
Vous avez besoin de fric, non ?
Continue à avancer, merde !
Faites pareil à Beecher.
- Je vous paierai.
- Pour tuer Beecher ?
2 000 dollars.
Si je sors,
mon secret part avec moi.
Il faudra payer d'avance.
L'argent sera viré
sur votre compte.
Dès que c'est confirmé,
Beecher est mort.
Voyant les Espagnols à cheval,
les Aztèques
ont cru qu'homme et cheval
ne faisaient qu'un.
Ils se sont agenouillés
Pour adorer
cette créature comme un dieu.
Parfois, ce qu'on voit
n'est pas la réalité.
Tu as vu Wittlesey et Beecher
hier soir ?
Une histoire de cul.
Elle avait pas l'air romantique.
Beecher a payé Wittlesey
pour l'aider à s'évader.
Il paraît
qu'ils baisent ensemble.
Beecher allait le répéter,
Wittlesey a voulu le buter.
Le répéter à qui ?
Il allait le dire à tout le monde.
Elle se tape
la moitié des matons.
Si Beecher parle,
ça fera chier les matons.
Alors elle attrape Beecher...
Je l'ai pas revu.
Parce qu'il s'est évadé.
Je te dis qu'il est mort.
On s'en tape !
Alors, hier soir ?
- Tu voulais la mort de Beecher ?
- C'est ça.
Tu m'as payée 2 000 dollars ?
Tu veux voir le corps ?
Putain, oui !
D'accord.
C'est par là.
Quoi ?
Bien tenté, mon petit Vern.
Tu as quelque chose à dire ?
Je sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
<i>- Tu voulais la mort de Beecher ?
- C'est ça.</i>
Oublie ta conditionnelle
et trouve-toi un bon avocat.
Tu es accusé de complot d'homicide.
C'est un piège !
Emmenez-le au trou.
Pourquoi tu es si content ?
Tu me crois fou ?
Plutôt !
Peut-être, mais l'avocat
qui est en moi resurgit parfois.
Je voulais
que Schillinger quitte Em City,
mais pas la prison.
Sa conditionnelle
devait être révoquée.
M'attaquer à lui
m'aurait causé des ennuis.
Alors, je l'ai rendu dingue
au point qu'il a voulu
me faire tuer.
Et non seulement Schillinger
a raté sa conditionnelle,
mais il fera 10 ans de plus.
C'est bien, M. Circoncision.
Et mal.
Il va encore plus
vouloir te buter.
Dieu merci, je suis fou
et j'en ai rien à foutre !
"Tout autour de moi,
"c'était la joie.
"J'étais si heureux
que je chantais
"une chanson pleine de gaieté."
- Il est là ?
- Avec le père Mukada.
- Pour longtemps ?
- Non.
Je vais attendre.
Vous aimez votre nouveau poste ?
Oui, le directeur est gentil.
C'est vrai.
Travailler dans une prison
me faisait peur,
mais je m'y suis habituée.
Tant mieux.
Bureau du directeur.
Bien sûr.
Ne quittez pas.
Votre femme sur la 3.
<i>Je la rappelle.</i>
C'est urgent.
Je comprends votre peur.
Les premiers temps,
j'étais sur les nerfs.
Vous voulez me rassurer.
On vous voit mal sur les nerfs.
Croyez-moi.
- Leo !
- Je dois filer.
J'ignore quand je reviendrai.
Il s'est passé quelque chose.
Tu m'évites ?
Reviens travailler à Em City.
Je suis bien où je suis.
J'ai besoin de toi.
C'est ça !
La façon dont tu as agi
avec Schillinger...
Il prétend
que tu as tué Scott Ross.
Ross a été tué
par la brigade d'intervention.
Il menace de le dire
à tout le monde.
Et alors ?
Personne n'écoutera Schillinger.
Surtout après l'affaire Beecher.
Tu as tué Ross ?
Tu vas croire ce nazi ?
Excusez-moi.
Le directeur a appelé,
il aura du retard
et souhaite que sœur Peter Marie
commence la réunion.
Il a dit pourquoi ?
Sa fille est à l'hôpital.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Ce que souhaite Leo.
On commence la réunion.
Premier point...
<i>Vous devez parler aux détenus.</i>
Désormais, la bibliothécaire
sera disponible
l'après-midi
du lundi au vendredi.
Le reste du temps,
elle sera avec moi !
Comment ?
Rien.
<i>Miguel Alvarez.</i>
Faites-le entrer.
Debout !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Tu vas travailler ici.
Je dois faire quoi ?
Va près de la porte.
Et après ?
Reste là.
Pourquoi je dois rester là ?
Attends que j'ai besoin de toi.
Il y a des visites à 16h.
Ma mère et mes sœurs viennent...
Oui, je sais.
Monsieur ?
Il est 15h50.
Et alors ?
J'ai rien foutu de la journée !
Ma mère et mes sœurs
vont arriver.
C'est vrai.
Tu as rien foutu de la journée.
Nettoie mes toilettes.
Quoi ?
Nettoie le sol, le lavabo,
la cuvette.
Quand tu auras fini
et que ce sera impeccable,
tu verras ta famille.
Vous me cherchez ?
C'est ça, je te cherche.
Le balai et le seau
sont là-dedans.
<i>Fils de pute !</i>
Merde !
Putain !
Je vous y prends !
Il devait le laisser là
et je ne le vois pas.
Vous vous appelez ?
Sara.
Moi, c'est Miguel.
Je sais.
Vous et moi,
c'est bizarre, non ?
On a pas beaucoup de contact.
On est chacun
d'un côté de la porte.
Je vois que vous me regardez
quand vous ouvrez la porte.
Je ne vous regarde pas.
Si, je vois que vous me regardez.
J'ai un truc à vous dire.
Je sais que vous le savez.
Vous êtes belle.
Et vous, vous me draguez.
Vous allez me faire arrêter ?
Bon sang, où est ce dossier ?
Je ne le trouve pas.
Elle a cherché partout.
Ferme-la ! Je t'ai rien demandé !
Et ne t'avise pas de lui parler !
Lui parler ?
Je l'ai déjà baisée.
Lâchez-moi ! Merde !
Vous m'étranglez !
Au trou !
Espèce de dégonflé !
Enfoiré !
Vous saignez.
Ah, la salle de gym !
L'odeur de la testostérone,
l'odeur de la sueur.
Allez droit au fait.
Sara veut démissionner à cause
de l'incident avec Alvarez.
Qu'elle démissionne.
Ce n'est pas aussi simple.
La question n'est pas là.
Quand on me demande
comment est Leo Glynn,
Le premier mot qui me vient
est "équilibré".
L'homme le plus équilibré
que je connaisse.
Et le second mot,
c'est "honnête".
Ecoutez,
ne répétez ça à personne.
Je vous le promets.
Ma fille aînée, Ardeth,
se rendait à l'école.
Elle est étudiante.
On l'a violée.
Mon Dieu !
Elle est à l'hôpital.
Elle est allongée,
les yeux ouverts, en état de choc.
Elle est adorable.
Elle ne critique jamais personne.
Je sais.
On sait qui a fait ça ?
Des témoins
ont vu une bande de jeunes...
Des Latinos.
Un Latino fait du mal à Ardeth
et vous vous vengez
sur un Latino !
Miguel Alvarez
n'a pas violé votre fille.
Quoi qu'il ait fait avant,
un homme tel que vous ne peut pas
le punir
pour ce qu'il n'a pas fait.
Tu retournes à Em City.
Glynn est au courant ?
Oui.
Vous l'avez convaincu
de me faire sortir ?
Je vous ai pas vu depuis...
Pendant l'émeute...
N'en parlons pas.
Je t'ai déjà pardonné.
Fais-en autant pour le directeur.
Outre les chevaux, les Aztèques
n'avaient jamais vu de canon.
Ils n'avaient jamais vu
de puissance aussi foudroyante.
Ils ont eu peur.
Entre les canons, les chevaux
et la comète,
leur monde tournait
vachement vite !
Tu t'es renversé du café ?
Quoi ?
Putain !
Ça fait mal ?
Alors ?
Recommencez.
C'est un examen,
pas une caresse.
C'est vous qui le dîtes.
Ça fait mal quand je touche ?
Votre mamelon a déjà été enflé ?
Un peu, mais je croyais
que c'était dû à l'exercice.
Vous êtes en bonne santé ?
Je suis vivant !
On va faire des examens sanguins
et une radio.
C'est quoi ?
Aucune idée.
Je vais ouvrir mon encyclopédie.
Vous passerez la nuit ici.
Du moment
que vous venez me border.
Faites une prise de sang.
C'est quoi, votre nom ?
Blackjack ! Tant pis pour toi.
Ryan !
Je reviens.
Vous m'appelez Ryan ?
Je peux vous appeler Gloria ?
J'ai les résultats du labo.
Je retourne à Em City ?
J'étais bien ici !
Vous ne partez pas encore.
Cette bosse est une tumeur.
Il faut pratiquer une biopsie.
On prélève du liquide
pour l'examiner.
- Pour chercher quoi ?
- Un carcinome.
Ça peut être
le cancer du sein.
C'est drôle !
Je suis sérieuse.
Le cancer du sein ?
- Ça touche que les filles.
- Les hommes aussi.
C'est rare, surtout à votre âge,
mais ça arrive.
Je suis pas pédé !
Je suis là depuis un an
et on m'a jamais enculé !
Personne ne dit le contraire.
Vous me parlez
d'une maladie de nana !
Les hommes aussi ont des seins.
Quoi ? J'ai pas de seins !
J'ai des pectoraux ! Regardez !
- Dr Nathan ?
- Ça va.
Ecoutez-moi :
reprenez vos bouquins,
refaites-moi des examens,
faites ce que vous voulez,
mais trouvez-moi autre chose !
Compris ?
J'ai pas le cancer du sein,
bordel !
Merde !
On ne peut pas lui en vouloir.
Le cancer du sein chez un homme,
c'est fou !
Le diagnostic est catégorique ?
Je suis généraliste.
Je ne vois pas ça souvent,
mais j'ai appelé
un ami oncologue.
Pour lui,
ça ne peut être que ça.
Il faut faire une biopsie.
O'Reilly refuse.
Même si on ne la lui fait pas,
il faudra qu'il accepte sa maladie
pour lutter contre.
On s'entend bien.
Je vais lui parler.
Je devrais peut-être le faire.
Il préférera parler à un mec.
- Il sera gêné.
- Voyez-le ensemble.
Il croira
qu'on complote contre lui.
J'ai la solution.
Sœur Peter, pile ou face ?
Vous m'appelez tous
par mon prénom !
Le Dr Nathan m'a parlé du cancer.
J'ai pas envie que tout le monde
soit au courant !
On peut aller dans mon bureau.
Pourquoi ? On a rien à se dire.
Nathan s'est plantée.
Peut-être.
Mais pour le savoir,
la biopsie est nécessaire.
Admettons qu'elle ait raison.
Et après ?
Je retourne à Em City.
Tous ces cons l'apprennent.
Vous savez
qu'à la moindre défaillance...
à la moindre défaillance,
je suis mort.
Si tu as...
Si tu es malade
et que tu fais rien,
tu es mort, de toutes façons.
Si cette merde se propage,
tout le monde saura la vérité.
Et ce sera trop tard
pour te sauver.
Je suis désolé.
<i>Voilà le plus drôle.</i>
<i>Les Espagnols ont exterminé
les Aztèques par accident.</i>
<i>Ils avaient des chevaux
et des canons,</i>
<i>mais ils ont aussi apporté
la variole.</i>
C'est une maladie
qui a fini le boulot.
Une maladie transmise
par les Espagnols sans le savoir.
<i>Ici, on survit comme on peut,</i>
<i>mais finalement, peu importe.</i>
<i>La vie s'en mêle toujours.</i>

TRIBUS ANCESTRALES
Saison 2, Episode 3
La fin du siècle approche !
La fin du millénaire !
On publie des listes
sur les plus grands hommes
de ce millénaire,
ceux qui l'ont le plus marqué.
Einstein, Edison, Freud !
Une chose est sûre :
mon nom n'y figurera pas.
Ni celui de personne à Oz.
Rebadow...
Tu sais, je crois que je t'ai eu.
J'ai eu une info avant toi.
Vraiment ?
Au sujet de la fille de Glynn.
Elle a été violée et est à l'hôpital ?
Merde ! Comment tu le sais ?
Je sais une chose que
tu ne sais sûrement pas.
Laquelle ?
Qui a violé la fille de Glynn.
Tu as raison, je ne le sais pas.
Moi, si.
Comment le sais-tu ?
Je viens de lui parler au téléphone.
Entrez.
Richie.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
J'aime me faire enculer.
Beaucoup trouvent ça pervers.
Mais, c'est mon problème.
Je les emmerde.
Et après ?
J'ai choisi de me faire enculer.
Mais le viol...
On t'a violé ?
Bien sûr.
Mais ce n'est pas le propos.
J'ai des infos sur un autre viol.
Je le savais.
- Et vous ne m'avez rien dit ?
- Il ne voulait pas.
Salut. Vous vouliez me voir ?
C'est au sujet d'Ardeth.
Dis-moi ce que tu sais.
- À quel sujet ?
- Ma fille.
Elle a été violée et tabassée.
Alors, vous vous vengez sur moi.
Qui l'a violée ?
Je ne vous dirai rien.
Vous avez le pouvoir, hein ?
Vous pensiez pouvoir traiter
les gens comme de la merde
et vous en tirer ?
Pas cette fois.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Miguel,
dis ce que tu sais sur sa fille.
Qu'elle baise comme un pied ?
Menottez-le.
Mon père, laissez-nous seuls.
Allez-y !
Dehors !
Faites-le sortir !
Cet enculé l'a bien mérité.
Vous êtes sûr ?
Cet appel a été passé d'Em City
par Miguel Alvarez.
On contrôle leurs appels
au hasard.
On n'a pas enregistré celui-ci.
Merde !
Leo...
Je suis désolé pour votre fille.
- Tout le monde est au courant ?
- Quasiment.
Je peux convaincre Alvarez
de donner le nom de ce salopard.
Non, merci.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ?
Primo, je ne veux plus rien te devoir.
Secundo, ça t'échappe sûrement,
mais ce n'est pas bien.
Entre le bien et le mal,
la frontière est mince.
Pas pour moi.
Les méchants aussi marquent l'Histoire.
Mais il faut être vraiment cruel.
Ivan le Terrible, Jack l'Éventreur,
Adolf Hitler.
Adolf était un vrai enculé.
Admettons-le,
le mal est la seule chose
qui soit restée intacte
ces mille dernières années.
Prisonnier matricule 98B242,
Agamemnon Busmalis,
alias La Taupe.
Condamné le 10 mars 98
pour vol qualifié avec effraction.
Peine : 10 ans.
Libérable sur parole dans 4 ans.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je prépare mon évasion.
C'est impossible.
C'est ce qu'on verra.
Combien de temps ça prendra ?
Je ne sais pas.
J'ai 4 ans jusqu'à l'audience
pour la conditionnelle.
Tu vas creuser pendant 4 ans ?
S'il le faut.
Le maton arrive.
Merci.
De rien.
Putain !
Quoi ?
Beecher !
T'as pété !
- Non.
- Putain, ça pue !
J'ai pas pété !
Bordel !
Encore cinq heures à tenir
dans une cage en verre
avec un pétomane !
Je vais être asphyxié !
- C'est toi qui as pété.
- Moi ?
Tu m'accuses pour te couvrir.
Tu dis ça pour te couvrir, toi.
Bisque, bisque, rage !
C'est celui qui l'dit qui y est !
Mets de l'encens.
Tu devrais voir un toubib, mec.
Les pets qui sentent
sont le signe d'un dérèglement.
Je n'ai pas pété.
Putain, mec !
Je vais prendre ma garde.
Je fais ma rentrée à Em City.
Si tu m'emmenais dîner dehors
pour fêter ça ?
Je ne peux pas.
T'as un rancard ?
À vrai dire, oui.
Ok. Amuse-toi bien.
Content de te revoir.
Merci.
La vie m'a mis en rogne l'autre jour.
Elle s'acharnait contre moi.
Alors, je lui ai arraché l'oreille.
Je l'ai poussée dans les cordes.
"Arrête de cogner quand l'arbitre
regarde pas !"
Je l'ai saisie au cou et j'ai dit :
"Arrête de me gueuler dessus
ou je t'envoie un crochet !"
Je l'ai secouée.
"Arrête de jouer avec moi
ou je t'étrangle !"
J'ai trop été dans les cordes,
j'ai vu trop de flics.
J'ai passé des milliers d'années
en prison !
Regarde l'article sur Tiger Woods.
Ce type gagne un fric fou.
Une fortune.
T'as vu ce qu'il dit sur ses parents ?
Le deuxième paragraphe. Ici.
"La plus grande influ..."
Influence.
"...dans ma vie est...
"celle de mes parents."
Excellent. Continue.
"Leur...
"patience...
"m'a permis de...
"...devenir un grand...
"champion."
- Excellent.
- Merde alors !
Ce petit négro sait lire.
Tu t'es entraîné ?
Un peu.
Garde-le.
Tu pourras le lire plus tard.
Merci.
On s'y met ?
Coushaine m'a dit que tu avais
très bien lu aujourd'hui.
Ça parlait de sport, alors...
Je me suis dit que tu méritais
une récompense
pour tous les efforts que tu fais.
"La fin de...
"l'esclavage."
Booker T. Washington.
Tu connais ?
Booker T. and the MG's.
C'est pas le même.
C'était l'un des Afro-américains
les plus influents de son époque.
Il pensait que l'éducation
était la clé de la réussite.
Le type des cacahuètes ?
Tu confonds avec George Washington Carver.
Ce livre a influencé ma vie.
McManus !
Ce pacte qu'on a fait
comme quoi j'étudierais
au lieu de bosser en cuisine...
je regrette vraiment pas.
T'as quelque chose pour moi ?
Tu vas en cours, Adebisi ?
J'ai un emploi du temps très chargé.
Tu devrais passer à mon bureau.
On regardera ton dossier.
Tu devrais retourner à l'école.
Ouais, j'y retournerai bientôt.
Tu parles !
Salut.
Tu le suces en mon absence ?
Il m'a apporté un bouquin.
Un bouquin ? C'est quoi ?
Tu me liras une histoire avant de dormir.
Qu'il revienne pas ici sans ma permission.
Je peux pas l'en empêcher.
Tu m'as pas écouté.
Lève-toi.
Il foutra plus les pieds ici.
Tu piges ?
Ouais, mec.
T'es vraiment pas bête.
Booker T. Washington.
Encore un grand homme.
Né esclave, il s'est levé
et a secoué l'arbre.
Il était connu
dans le monde entier.
Même le président des États-Unis
lui demandait conseil.
Comment est-ce qu'il a fait ?
Il y a du grabuge dans l'air.
Ouais. Glynn fouine un peu trop
du côté de Scibetta.
Il t'a dit pourquoi ?
Pas besoin, je le sais.
Sans blague ?
Il essaie de déclencher
une guerre entre nous et les Ritals.
Glynn ?
Ouais.
Pourquoi il ferait ça ?
Parce qu'il les déteste.
Merde alors !
Voilà le petit Nino.
Tu ressembles à ton père.
Sauf que toi, t'es en vie.
T'essaies de me dire un truc ?
Oui.
Ton père me manque.
Au boulot, bande de fainéants.
Au suivant !
Amène-toi.
On va se faire un petit sniff.
- C'est quoi, ton problème ?
- J'en ai pas.
À la fouille !
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
C'est quoi, le problème ?
Les mains sur la rampe.
Ils n'ont rien.
Tu vois !
Le bouquin.
Tu sais quoi ?
Maintenant, c'est mon livre.
Mon bouquin pour ma came.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Une sale gueule, mais je l'adore.
Va te faire foutre !
T'oublies qui t'es, mon frère !
McManus, ce bouquin, l'école...
Tu me manques de respect !
Oublie pas qui sont tes amis.
Parce que si t'es pas mon ami,
alors, t'es mon ennemi.
Pigé ?
Ouais, putain, j'ai pigé !
Faut que je me défonce.
T'es pas en classe ?
T'as un problème, McManus ?
Viens.
Merde !
Pourquoi tu sèches ?
Ça marchait si bien.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Rien.
On fait pression sur toi ?
Ouais, vous.
Dis-moi ce qu'il se passe, Kenny !
C'est à cause d'Adebisi ?
Dégage, on est en train de parler.
Taxi !
Je vais le faire transférer.
Non. Il croira que je vous l'ai demandé
et ce sera ma fête.
Je vais te changer de cellule.
Laissez tomber.
Ou tu retournes à l'école
ou je te fais récurer la cuisine
24 heures sur 24.
Je te ferai récurer
toute cette putain de prison !
Que choisis-tu ?
Alors ?
L'école.
Vite, t'es en retard.
Booker T. Washington écrit :
"Je crois au pouvoir et
à l'influence des faits.
"On n'acquiert rien définitivement
"en cachant un fait."
Vous voulez des faits ?
Selon un rapport du ministère,
le détenu américain type
est un jeune peu instruit
issu d'une minorité.
On s'en doutait.
Si ce jeune sans instruction
passe son bac en prison,
il a moins de chances d'y retourner.
W.E.B. Du Bois.
Donnons ça à Kenny.
S'il suit des études supérieures en taule,
ses chances de revoir une cellule
sont quasi nulles.
L'an passé, l'État de Californie
a plus dépensé pour les prisons
que pour les universités.
Ce sont les faits.
Faut pas être un génie pour les recouper.
Je me taperais bien le Dr Nathan.
Moi aussi.
- Et Wittlesey ?
- Et comment !
Moi aussi.
Vous savez qui je trouve sexy ?
La sœur Peter Marie.
- C'est une religieuse !
- Pas depuis toujours.
Elle était mariée.
Impossible, les bonnes sœurs
sont les épouses du Christ.
C'était avant d'être sœur.
Son mari est mort.
Elle me l'a dit.
- Il est mort de quoi ?
- Elle l'a pas dit.
Un accident. Il serait tombé
de l'arrière d'un camion.
C'était pas un accident.
D'où sa présence ici.
Son mari a été poussé.
C'était un meurtre.
Peter, Peter Marie !
Peter !
Peter Marie !
Vous connaissez William Giles ?
Non.
Il a perdu la boule.
Il vous réclame.
Bonjour, William.
Vous vouliez me parler ?
Malade.
Vous êtes malade ?
Amour ?
Balai.
Vous voulez un balai ?
Non.
Ok, William.
William...
Vous voulez me parler ?
Tobias, pouvez-vous me trouver
le dossier de William Giles ?
G-I-L-E-S.
On vous a élue la plus sexy.
Comment ça, la plus sexy ?
De la prison.
Allons !
Vraiment ?
Je l'ai.
Prisonnier matricule 58G714,
William Giles.
Condamné le 6 février 1958
pour homicide involontaire.
Peine : perpétuité.
Libérable sur parole dans 60 ans.
Leo, il faut que vous fassiez sortir
Giles du mitard
pour démarrer la thérapie.
- Vous savez ce qu'il a fait ?
- J'ai lu son dossier.
Il a volé son dentifrice à un détenu.
Celui-ci l'a surpris, Giles l'a tué.
- C'est un fou dangereux.
- Je peux l'aider.
C'est beaucoup trop risqué.
Je vais voir ma fille à l'hôpital.
Peter !
Peter Marie !
Peter Marie !
Peter ! Peter Marie !
Croyez-vous qu'à la fin
du premier millénaire, en 999,
ils ont fait des listes ?
Savaient-ils seulement
que le millénaire s'achevait ?
Saïd !
Tu perturbes notre prière.
T'as du courrier. Signe.
Plus tard.
J'ai pas le temps.
Schillinger est au trou.
On manque de personnel.
Finalement, je signerai avec joie.
Ah ouais ? Tu m'en vois ravi.
Mes frères...
Ton bouquin sur l'émeute !
Ceci est la preuve
que la vérité ne peut être muselée.
Le "Code Annoté" ?
Tu délaisses Dieu pour la loi ?
Je connais les lois de Dieu.
Pas celles de l'homme.
J'étudie le droit depuis 8 mois,
pour voir si Ses lois et celles des Blancs
ont des points communs.
Qu'as-tu découvert ?
Que ce ne sont là que des mots.
La loi n'existe que pour être contournée.
Sans loi, c'est l'anarchie.
Tu devrais lire le journal.
C'est aussi l'anarchie avec.
Cette émeute ne t'a donc rien appris ?
On ne peut renverser le système.
J'ai beaucoup appris.
Je ne tiens pas à voir
d'autres hommes mourir.
Non.
J'utiliserai les outils
qu'on a utilisés contre moi.
Je ferai en sorte que la loi...
se dévore elle-même.
Le juge Kibler a été condamné
à 16 mois de prison.
Il a été reconnu coupable
de s'être laissé soudoyer
en échange de sa clémence
envers 3 meurtriers...
T'entends ça ?
Cet enculé de Kibler était mon juge !
Vraiment ?
Ouais ! Si j'avais su
qu'on pouvait l'acheter,
j'aurais allongé mes 2 dollars.
C'est pas juste.
T'as raison.
Tu sais ce que tu devrais faire ?
Quoi ?
En parler à Saïd.
L'article dit que Kibler a touché
des pots-de-vin en novembre.
Est-ce que lui ou un autre
t'a parlé de pots-de-vin ?
Personne ne m'a rien dit.
A-t-il parlé à ton avocat ?
S'il l'a fait, j'en ai rien su.
Bien.
On tient notre affaire.
Notre affaire ?
Tu n'as pas eu droit à un procès équitable
par un juge impartial.
On pourrait aller en justice
et faire casser le verdict ?
Mon ami...
tu as de bonnes chances
de sortir d'ici libre.
Le juge Kibler n'a pas touché
de pots-de-vin dans l'affaire Hill.
C'est exact.
- Et il n'en a pas demandé.
- C'est exact.
Où veux-tu en venir ?
Le juge était indulgent
avec ceux qui le payaient
et sévère avec les autres.
On veut juste
pouvoir étudier le bien-fondé de la cause.
Que réclames-tu au juste ?
Et jusqu'à quand ?
Allongez les temps de visite.
Je dois voir l'avocat d'Augustus,
ceux qui ont payé des pots-de-vin,
leurs avocats, les représentants
du Parquet au procès Kibler, etc.
Tu n'as pas dit un mot.
Kareem Saïd sait de quoi il parle.
Je serais bien con de l'ouvrir.
- Vous mentez.
- Non.
J'étais assis à côté de vous
pendant tout le procès.
Je sais quand vous mentez.
Vous avez ce petit tic.
Vraiment ?
Quel avocat de merde !
Augustus, l'insulter ne t'avancera à rien.
Si, ça me défoule.
J'ai fait tout mon possible.
Ça prouve votre nullité !
Peut-on revenir
au sujet, s'il vous plaît ?
Vous saviez que d'autres le soudoyaient ?
J'avais entendu des rumeurs.
Fallait en profiter !
J'espérais un acquittement
fondé sur ma seule défense.
Si vous étiez au courant,
il fallait alerter la commission.
Et si ça n'avait rien donné,
à ma plaidoirie suivante,
Kibler m'aurait démoli.
Alors ?
Marilyn Crenshaw,
l'assistante du procureur
qui a poursuivi Kibler,
viendra nous voir demain.
Les avocats qui ont soudoyé Kibler
refusent de prendre mes appels.
On dit qu'on me rappellera.
Je réponds que c'est impossible.
Voyons si un de ces 3 meurtriers
est bouclé à Oz.
J'ai vérifié.
Ils sont dans d'autres prisons.
Que faire ?
Je leur écrirai, mais je doute
qu'ils répondent.
C'est foutu.
Les bonnes choses n'arrivent pas comme ça.
À l'appel !
À demain.
Quand vous réunissiez
les preuves contre Kibler,
le nom de Hill a-t-il été cité ?
Non.
Ces trois procès pour meurtre
présentaient-ils des similitudes ?
Non.
Aucun point commun ?
Type de meurtre, avocat, couleur de peau ?
Tu n'en feras pas une affaire raciale.
Je ne le veux pas.
Mon œil !
Tout ce qu'ils ont en commun,
c'est d'être coupables.
Ça s'est fait au hasard ?
Prête à en témoigner ?
Oblige-moi à témoigner
et je te traîne en justice.
Pourquoi ferais-tu ça ?
L'assistante d'un procureur
est dévouée à la justice.
Cette justice s'applique-t-elle
à mon client ?
Ton client ? De grâce !
Tu n'es avocat que dans ta tête.
Je vois clair dans ton jeu.
Tu fais la nique au système
et à tout ce en quoi je crois.
Je l'aurais aidé, sans toi.
Vous pouvez gagner.
Un bon conseil :
trouvez-vous un avocat.
Un vrai !
Tu la connais ?
Pourquoi ?
Vous vous tutoyiez.
C'est la garce qui t'a poursuivi ?
Marilyn et moi...
avant que je ne découvre Allah...
nous étions fiancés.
J'ai besoin de pouvoir appeler
et être appelé à tout moment.
Installe un standard dans ta cellule.
Répondre à une demande légitime
par un sarcasme !
Une demande légitime ?
Tu es détenu dans une prison
de haute sécurité.
Si j'accepte, tous réclameront
la même chose.
- C'est un cas particulier.
- Non !
Navré de te l'apprendre, mais ici,
tu es comme les autres.
Tu ne mérites aucun privilège.
C'est à cause de ce que j'ai dit sur toi
dans mon bouquin ?
Tu me demandes toujours mon aide
sans jamais rien en échange.
Il faut qu'il y ait un troc ?
Des négociations ?
Servir une cause juste devrait te suffire.
Ça n'a pas marché ?
Merde !
Tu disais que rien de bon
n'arrivait comme ça ?
L'idée de passer sa vie en prison,
c'est dur à accepter.
Mais j'y suis arrivé,
comme tous ceux qui sont ici.
Je me suis adapté, résigné.
Mais quand tu m'as dit le mot "libre"...
Ça a réveillé quelque chose en moi.
La liberté.
Je veux ma liberté.
Et tu l'auras, mon frère.
Je te jure
devant Dieu
et ce que j'ai de plus sacré...
que tu recouvreras la liberté.
BOOKER T. WASHINGTON
LA FIN DE L'ESCLAVAGE
Ces dossiers sont confidentiels.
Je me suis toujours intéressé
à mon prochain.
J'ai les résultats de la ponction.
N'y allez pas par quatre chemins.
Cette boule sous le mamelon
est un carcinome.
On l'a détecté relativement tôt.
Vos chances de survie sont bonnes.
Il va falloir opérer.
Des questions ?
Vous êtes mariée ?
Moi aussi. Vous aimeriez ma femme.
C'est une vraie emmerdeuse.
Ce toubib sait de quoi il parle ?
Elle.
- Je parlerai à cette garce.
- Calme-toi !
M'emmerde pas !
C'est pour ton bien.
On se connaît depuis le lycée.
On baisait sans arrêt.
Nos amis s'étonnaient
qu'elle tombe jamais enceinte.
Un jour, avant qu'on se marie,
elle a fait des tests.
Ses trompes étaient bouchées.
Elle pouvait pas avoir de mômes.
Je l'ai quand même épousée.
Je savais qu'elle se sentait rabaissée.
Elle ne se sentait plus femme.
Je m'en vais.
Je l'ai trompée.
Souvent.
Je ne veux pas mourir.
Ça va aller.
Point suivant.
O'Reilly subira une mastectomie demain.
Il faut un fourgon et un garde.
- Ou deux.
- Tu crains qu'il ne s'évade ?
J'assisterai le Dr Powell,
la spécialiste du cancer du sein.
- Tout ça va coûter cher.
- Ce ne sera pas donné.
- Notre assurance paiera ?
- Non.
Ils insistent pour qu'il ait
une énucléation.
On ôte la tumeur, mais pas le sein.
Dans ce cas, pourquoi faire
une mastectomie ?
Ça ne marche pas toujours.
Il faut souvent une chimio après.
La prison devra payer
pour tout ça.
Combien ça fera ?
Chirurgien, personnel, équipement :
en tout, 18 000 $.
Et pour une énucléation ?
Moitié moins.
Alors, une énucléation.
C'est au patient de choisir.
Pas à ce prix-là,
pas quand c'est un détenu.
C'est humiliant pour un homme
d'avoir un cancer du sein.
Sa survie dépend autant de son moral
que de l'opération.
Il y a tant à faire avec 18 000 $.
Ça peut paraître dur,
mais qu'il vive 2 mois ou 20 ans,
je m'en fous.
À toi de trancher.
L'énucléation.
Point suivant.
Si tu meurs, que ferai-je de ton frère ?
- Salut, frangin.
- Salut, Cyril. Approche.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Pourquoi es-tu si tendu ?
Je suis pas tendu.
Si, ton corps est tout raide.
C'est à cause des grilles
et des gardiens.
Cet endroit fout la trouille.
Tout juste.
Pourquoi tu vis ici ?
Parce que j'ai été méchant.
Alors, tâche de plus l'être.
Tu rentres quand ?
Pas tout de suite.
Je suis un peu malade.
Je vais devoir me faire opérer.
Non, pas d'opération.
Pas d'opération.
Maman est morte pendant une opération !
Arrête !
Écoute, tout se passera bien.
Mais si ça rate,
Shannon devra refaire sa vie.
Si elle te dit de partir...
- J'aime notre appartement.
- Je sais.
Tu devras peut-être aller vivre
avec d'autres gens...
qui te ressemblent davantage.
Alors, si Shannon te dit de partir,
tu ne dois pas pleurer
ni lui rendre la vie impossible.
Compris ?
Parce que tu dois mûrir
et devenir un homme, Cyril.
Il est temps d'être adulte.
ENTRÉE DES AMBULANCES
Dr Nathan ?
C'est moi.
Pour vous, ce n'est qu'un criminel,
mais c'est mon mari, pigé ?
Je me suis renseignée.
Vous avez choisi l'opération
la moins chère.
La vie de mon mari est précieuse.
Faites en sorte qu'il vive.
Je vous le conseille.
Je sais qui a tué Dino.
Prêt ?
Finissons-en.
Le docteur se lave les mains.
Dire que ma vie est entre les mains
d'une inconnue.
C'est la meilleure.
Votre présence me rassure.
Mon ange gardien...
Blague à part,
je ne sais pas pourquoi vous êtes
si gentille, mais j'en suis ravi.
Personne ne s'est jamais soucié de moi.
Alors, je ne sais pas dire merci.
Je vous dois énormément.
Certains médecins méritent de figurer
sur la liste des grands hommes.
Ils font de la recherche,
découvrent des maladies.
Mais personne ne mettra
les docteurs Epstein et Barr,
Down ou Alzheimer,
sur aucune liste.
Car, malgré leur travail,
entendre leurs noms nous terrifie.
Leurs noms nous rendent malades.
Tu es transféré à l'unité B.
Tu me manqueras.
J'ai pas voulu tuer Beecher, toi, si.
Le procureur a décidé de t'inculper
de complot pour meurtre.
Tu veux un avocat commis d'office ?
Oui, je rêve d'une bonne âme
pour me défendre.
Je me trouverai un avocat.
À ta place, je ne reprendrais pas le même.
Espèce d'enculé !
Je vous donne mon avis
et vous m'insultez !
Faites disparaître l'inculpation
de complot pour meurtre.
Je suis avocat, pas magicien.
L'accusation a un dossier solide.
Ce gardien va témoigner contre vous.
Or un représentant de la loi
a plus de crédibilité que vous.
Je risque combien ?
Dix ans de plus.
Alors, je balancerai.
Je doute que le procureur
accepte un arrangement.
J'ai vu Wittlesey tuer Ross.
J'ai avisé les autorités
et demandé une enquête,
mais ça ne servira à rien.
Et mes fils ?
Des nouvelles ?
Non, mais on les retrouvera.
Oui, flottant dans une rivière !
Ils sont Dieu sait où,
en train de se camer !
Je vous en supplie, retrouvez-les.
Entendu.
La sœur Peter Marie veut
que ça parte en exprès.
Salut, Vern !
Déjà sorti du trou ?
T'es furieux contre moi ?
Ouais, t'es furieux.
Ça se comprend.
T'auras pas de conditionnelle,
tu risques 10 piges de plus,
tout ça à cause de moi !
Putain ! Je t'ai manipulé
comme l'abruti de primate blanc que t'es !
On connaît bien un type
quand il vous encule.
Ben alors, bichon, on devient ramollo ?
T'es Schillinjer ?
Schillinger, ouais.
Tu dirigeais la Confrérie Aryenne ?
Oui.
Et tu laisses Beecher t'emmerder ?
La Confrérie se désagrège.
Avant, on nous craignait.
À présent, on n'effraie personne.
Toi et moi, on peut reprendre
les choses en main.
On peut dirigez Oz.
- On commence par quoi ?
- Un meurtre,
pour montrer qu'on est de retour.
Qui on tue le premier ?
La pire ordure qu'on trouvera.
Prisonnier matricule 98V238,
Alexander Vogel.
Condamné le 1er juin 1998.
Coupable de deux homicides et de vol.
Peine : 50 ans.
Libérable sur parole dans 30 ans.
JUIF
Ainsi, tu ne sais rien
du meurtre de Vogel ?
Si ce n'est pas la Confrérie,
pourquoi ce "Juif" sur sa poitrine ?
On veut nous faire porter le chapeau.
Il n'y a pas que nous
qui détestons les Juifs.
Votre peuple aussi.
Tu es mêlé à ça, je le sais.
Ah oui ?
Dans ce cas...
prouvez-le.
Compte sur moi.
Emmenez-le à sa cellule.
J'aimerais être au pays
du coton...
Félicitations pour Vogel.
Ils savent tous que c'est nous.
Et maintenant ?
On va s'occuper de lui.
On va tuer Beecher ?
Oui.
Mais avant, on le fera souffrir.
Des souffrances longues et atroces.
Le plus grand homme du millénaire
est peut-être une femme.
Lady Di, Mère Teresa,
Catherine II, Marie Curie,
Marilyn Monroe !
On dira ce qu'on veut,
elle a rendu son époque
vachement plus intéressante.
Shirley Billinger, qui a tué
sa fille de 4 ans,
a été condamnée à mort.
C'est la première femme depuis 1841.
Elle recevra une injection mortelle
le mois prochain à Oswald.
Son avocat a déjà fait appel.
Il donnera demain
une conférence de presse.
Le gouverneur Devlin a dit
qu'il approuvait le verdict
et qu'il refuserait
toute demande de sursis.
Très confortable.
Imaginez qu'on se souvienne de vous
pendant mille ans,
que ce que vous ayez fait
traverse le temps,
touchant des gens
qui ne sont pas encore nés.
C'est un sacré rêve !
C'est pour ça que les gens
écrivent des bouquins,
trouvent des remèdes, sont présidents.
Moi, je ne veux pas être un grand homme.
Ça m'est égal qu'on m'oublie.
Je ne demande qu'une chose :
si vous me croisez dans la rue,
remarquez-moi.

SANS APPEL
Saison 2, Episode 4
Il y en a qui disent
que la Bible est
la plus belle des histoires.
La plus belle, c'est :
un garçon rencontre une fille,
le garçon perd la fille,
le garçon a la fille.
Un garçon rencontre une fille.
Le moment où chaque particule
de la bite
entre en action.
<i>Bien sûr, on a pas tous
les mêmes pulsions.</i>
Vous faites quoi ici ?
Mon petit Richie,
où tu étais passé ?
Descends de là.
Suce-moi.
Va te faire voir !
Un pédé, ça suce des bites.
Où est le problème ?
Je suce qui je veux.
Casse-toi !
Ne me parle pas comme ça.
Il y a un problème ?
Fais gaffe.
Ce qui est arrivé à Vogel
va t'arriver.
Tu vas te réveiller
pendu par les chevilles.
Tu as tué Vogel ?
Ouais, avec Schillinger.
Maintenant, suce-moi !
<i>Détenu matricule 98H462,</i>
<i>Richard Hanlon.</i>
<i>Condamné le 3 juin 98</i>
<i>pour détention et revente
de stupéfiants.</i>
<i>Peine : 8 ans.</i>
Conditionnelle
au bout de 5 ans.
Salut, Richie !
C'est mon tour ?
Tu as pompé Mark,
c'est mon tour.
Qui l'a poussé ?
Il me cherchait, je vous jure.
Je l'ai écarté.
Tu vas être accusé de meurtre.
Attendez.
Si je vous donne des tuyaux,
qu'est-ce que j'ai
en échange ?
Ça dépend de tes tuyaux.
Ça concerne un meurtre, un vrai.
Ici, à Oz ?
Alexander Vogel.
Si je dis qui a tué Vogel,
ça change mon inculpation ?
Si tes renseignements
tiennent la route.
On se retrouve, Schillinger !
J'ai la preuve
que tu as tué Vogel.
La preuve ?
Ton ami Mack a avoué.
C'est du pipeau !
Il a dit à un détenu
que vous aviez agi ensemble.
Vous parlez d'un aveu !
Mack niera,
moi aussi. Ça sera notre parole
contre celle du mouchard.
Mack est à côté,
en train de tout cracher.
C'est du pipeau, je vous dis.
Et même si c'était vrai,
vous pensez que j'admettrais
avoir fait ça ?
Dans vos rêves les plus fous,
je vous ferais ce plaisir ?
Emmenez-le.
Ecoute-moi bien.
Mes amis sont très contrariés
que tu les accuses de meurtre.
Tu es mort.
Malgré tout,
ils t'offrent une alternative.
Comme tu es là pour meurtre,
tu avoues aussi
celui d'Alexander Vogel.
Tente ta chance au procès.
Au mieux, tu as perpète.
Au pire, la peine de mort.
Si tu obtiens perpète,
mes amis te laisseront vivre.
Sinon, tu es un homme mort
de toutes façons.
Alors, choisis.
Dites à Glynn
que j'ai un aveu à lui faire.
Bravo, mon garçon.
Augustus ?
L'audience approche.
J'étais perdu dans mes pensées.
Tu pensais à quoi ?
Je me disais
que si tout se passait bien,
je pourrais quitter Oz.
Que d'ici ce soir,
je serais chez moi
avec ma femme,
à boire une bière
et à regarder un match.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
D'ici ce soir,
je pourrais être libre.
Audience de l'affaire
numéro 966133,
Hill contre l'État.
M. Saïd.
Mme la présidente,
Il est de notoriété publique
que Richard Kibler,
dans l'exercice
de ses fonctions de juge,
a été soudoyé
en échange de peines indulgentes
par trois assassins.
M. Saïd affirme
que son client a été lésé
car il n'a jamais donné
de pot-de-vin.
Mais dans ce cas,
il n'a pas été lésé.
Le défenseur
doit fournir des preuves
et non pas
un semblant de preuves.
Alors que Kibler
touchait des pots-de-vin,
mon client a comparu devant lui.
Il a été déclaré coupable
et condamné par Kibler
à la prison à perpétuité
avec conditionnelle
au bout de 20 ans.
Augustus Hill a tué
un policier de sang-froid.
Objection !
La nature du crime
est liée à la peine.
Objection rejetée.
M. Saïd a demandé au tribunal
la cassation de la peine de Hill
en raison de l'accusation
pesant sur M. Kibler.
Étant donné la corruption,
mon client s'est vu refuser
un procès équitable
présidé par un juge impartial.
Par conséquent,
Augustus Hill a droit
à la cassation de sa peine.
Il n'y a aucun précédent
de décision semblable.
Pour ce faire,
il faudrait aller
au-delà de la compétence
de ce tribunal.
M. Saïd,
appelez le premier témoin.
Augustus Hill.
Jurez-vous de dire la vérité,
toute la vérité,
rien que la vérité ?
Je le jure.
Comment ça va ?
Je sais pas trop.
Ce Fortunato est coriace,
il est bon.
Et Saïd ?
On rejette ses objections.
Je suis plus tendu
que pour mon premier procès.
C'est normal.
Tu connaissais pas la prison.
L'incarcération
n'était qu'un concept.
Maintenant,
tu sais ce qui t'attend
si tu perds.
Il nous faut une bombe.
On doit trouver un condamné
qui a refusé de payer
et a été jugé partialement.
Ça existe ?
Et si c'est le cas,
autant chercher une aiguille
dans une botte de foin.
Pour vite trouver l'aiguille,
il faut brûler la botte.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
Voilà, mon frère.
La liste
des meurtriers
condamnés par Kibler.
Si l'un d'eux
affirme ne pas avoir payé
et qu'on prouve
la partialité de sa peine,
on prouve l'injustice.
On a pas le temps
de contacter tous ces gens.
Il fallait le faire avant !
Aucun privilège
pour le téléphone.
Laissez-moi utiliser le fax.
Cette prison n'est pas
un tribunal populaire !
Tu ne vas pas rouvrir
le dossier de chacun !
Qu'y a-t-il de mal
à lutter pour la justice ?
Que le juge soit honnête ou pas,
Hill a tué un flic.
Que je gagne ou que je perde,
je continuerai le combat
pour la liberté de mes frères.
Il a refusé, une fois de plus.
Je dirai à mon éditeur d'appeler
les avocats de ces condamnés.
Il nous faudrait
ce qui nous manque : du temps !
Alors, on créera du temps.
Si on perd, je ferai appel.
Pour quel motif ?
Mme Lema rejette mes objections
par racisme.
Ça serait pas
parce qu'elles sont débiles ?
Ça serait pas parce que t'es pas
un si bon avocat que ça ?
Tu veux que Beecher
plaide notre cause ?
Notre cause ?
C'est pas notre cause,
mais ma vie !
Je veux pas être
un martyr ou un saint à la con !
Je veux sortir et être libre !
Soit tu m'obtiens ça,
soit tu me fous la paix !
Putain !
Quelqu'un veut parler
avant que je ne me prononce ?
Oui, Mme la présidente.
Soyez bref. J'habite loin
et c'est l'heure de pointe.
Mon client et moi
étant en prison,
le temps et les moyens
sont limités pour nous.
Il nous est impossible
de fournir d'autres preuves.
Je le note.
Autre chose.
On ne saura jamais ce que
M. Kibler pensait de mon client,
mais on sait bien
ce qu'il pensait de la justice.
Merci.
À l'argument qui dit
qu'il n'y a pas de précédent
à une telle cassation,
que cela dépasserait
la compétence de ce tribunal,
je réponds "foutaises" !
Les précédents
deviennent des précédents
à partir du moment
où un juge le décide !
Cependant,
l'avocat général avance
que le défenseur doit montrer
plus qu'un semblant de preuves
et il a raison.
J'ai étudié
Les minutes du procès de M. Hill
avec attention.
A aucun moment,
M. Kibler n'a dépassé,
en paroles ou en actes,
les limites
de la compétence judiciaire.
Et la peine,
étant donné
la sévérité des accusations,
ne semble pas
démesurément cruelle
ou inhabituelle.
Par conséquent,
je statue en faveur de l'État
et refuse à Augustus Hill
la cassation de son jugement.
Garde la foi.
Ce n'est que le début.
Non, c'est fini.
Toute cette merde me dépasse.
Les choses prennent du temps.
La justice...
C'est pas la justice
qui me dépasse,
c'est l'espoir.
L'espoir m'écrase, mon pote.
L'espoir ?
L'espoir est tout ce qu'on a.
Tout ce que j'ai, c'est Oz.
A qui le tour ?
Je peux lire un poème ?
C'est un truc que j'ai écrit.
"L'intérieur de ma cellule
me voit captivé
par sa sérénité
dans ma quête d'intimité
derrière les barreaux.
Les législateurs s'élèvent,
mais la paix meurt
dans des baisers maudits
et l'adoration disparaît
dans cet endroit
merveilleusement dégoûtant
qui s'appelle Emerald City."
T'as fini, tapette ?
Quoi ?
Je te traite de tapette !
À la prochaine bagarre,
tu quittes Em City.
Recule.
Allez, dehors !
Wangler manque de discipline.
C'est parce que je le force
à venir en cours.
Il progressait bien
et il s'est bloqué.
Adebisi
lui en fait en baver.
Et le Poète ?
Il a du talent.
Voilà un magnétophone.
Enregistre ses poèmes
et rapporte-le-moi.
- Pourquoi ?
- J'ai une idée.
Assieds-toi.
Que voulez-vous ?
J'ai fini ton livre
sur l'émeute.
Vous voulez une dédicace ?
Je veux te parler du Poète.
Voici certaines de ses œuvres.
Montre-les à ton éditeur.
Vous vous rappelez
mon arrivée ici ?
Vous m'avez dit
que "mon statut de célébrité"
ne me donnerait aucun avantage.
Vous me l'avez rappelé récemment
et maintenant,
c'est vous qui tirez avantage
de mon statut.
Il ne s'agit pas de toi,
mais du Poète, de son avenir.
Il s'agit aussi de vous.
S'il était publié, ça ferait
de la pub à votre programme.
Vous deviendriez un héros.
Tu as l'occasion d'aider
quelqu'un, un camarade.
Je sais quand aider un frère.
On peut pas oublier
ces conneries pour une fois ?
Rien qu'une fois.
- File-m'en.
- Non.
Donne-moi de la came.
Allez, mon pote !
Tu paies pas
depuis des semaines !
Occupe-toi de ta poésie !
Tu défies ta destinée.
C'est grâce à ton don.
Quoi ?
J'ai parlé de toi à mon éditeur.
Il est très intéressé
par tes œuvres.
Ne doute pas de toi.
Ils sont dans l'erreur.
Assieds-toi.
Laisse-les se moquer.
Ils verront bien.
Pas si je les démolis !
Ecoute-moi. Regarde-moi.
Tu as un devoir, une vocation.
Arrête tes salades !
Dis-moi ce que je dois faire.
Rien.
Si ce n'est me faire confiance.
Kareem, tu avais raison.
Je vais être publié !
Félicitations, mon frère.
Génial !
Où ?
Dans une anthologie de poèmes
intitulée "Amérique oubliée".
Il y sera représenté.
Super !
Et j'ai reçu du blé !
Regarde !
J'en ai deux.
File-moi de la dope.
D'où tu sors ça, mon salaud ?
D'où ça sort, négro ?
De ma poésie.
Qui paie
de la poésie ?
Une maison d'édition
publie mes poèmes.
Sans déconner !
Apprends-moi.
Apprends-moi à écrire.
Je peux pas.
Je veux écrire des vers
sur le Nigeria.
Il y a rien qui rime
avec Nigeria !
Salope !
Alors ? Aide-moi !
Cafétéria.
Et Nigeria.
Malaria...
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Adebisi détruit les autres
par son autodestruction.
On faisait juste notre lessive !
On faisait notre lessive,
putain !
Toi, tu es tellement clean
et vertueux !
J'ai des démons
accrochés au cul !
Moi aussi,
mais ils ne m'entraînent pas.
Apprends à lutter par ta volonté.
Ils reviennent toujours.
Illusions !
Voilà ta réalité.
Crois en Son pouvoir.
C'est des conneries !
Crois !
Pourquoi ?
J'ai pris sur moi de réunir
des écrivains
pour réclamer ta conditionnelle.
Ma conditionnelle ?
Crois-moi, mon frère.
Tu seras le symbole
de la justice américaine.
Tu seras
comme le Phénix qui renaît
- à travers ta poésie -
des cendres d'un asile de fous.
Moi, un symbole ?
Putain !
<i>Il y a foule</i>
<i>devant la prison</i>
<i>d'Oswald pour soutenir</i>
<i>Arnold Jackson,</i>
<i>un détenu dont la poésie</i>
<i>a rassemblé des artistes</i>
<i>réclamant
sa liberté conditionnelle.</i>
<i>Cette campagne
a commencé avec Foster Perry,</i>
<i>éditeur d'une anthologie
de la littérature marginale</i>
<i>intitulée "Amérique oubliée".</i>
<i>Certains critiques
disent que c'est</i>
<i>pour la publicité du livre.</i>
<i>Mais de nombreux artistes
se sont unis</i>
<i>pour affirmer que M. Jackson</i>
<i>avait un talent rare, perdu</i>
<i>dans le système barbare
de la prison.</i>
Putain !
Un garçon rencontre une fille.
Le garçon perd la fille.
Le garçon a la fille.
C'est le meilleur moment !
Après des tas d'emmerdes,
les deux amoureux se regardent
les yeux dans les yeux
et l'histoire s'arrête !
Mais...
qu'est-ce qui se passe après ?
Il s'en prend à elle,
elle s'en prend à lui.
Le garçon rend la fille folle
et vice versa.
C'est génial. Pas de corvées,
pas de matons, pas d'emmerdeurs.
Il y a du bon dans la mort.
Vous survivrez.
L'intervention a réussi.
La tumeur a été enlevée.
La chimio fait le reste.
Il y a des risques de rechute ?
90% des malades sont en vie
5 ans après.
63% sont en vie
au bout de 10 ans.
Ma conditionnelle
est dans 11 ans.
Dès que je sortirai,
la tumeur reviendra !
Vous êtes jeune, robuste.
Vous vous en tirerez.
O'Reilly revient aujourd'hui.
Ah bon ? Il est à l'hosto
depuis un bail.
Ça doit être grave.
Il paraît qu'on l'a opéré
et qu'on lui fait de la chimio.
La chimio,
ça peut faire des dégâts.
Ça peut aussi sauver des vies.
Tu regardes quoi ?
Fous-moi le camp !
Je veux reprendre la cuisine.
Pas question.
Je plaisante pas.
Pas question, le cancéreux !
- Tu nous imites ?
- Oui, je veux être moche.
On se demande ce que tu as.
On parle de cancer des couilles,
on te les aurait coupées.
Mais j'y crois pas,
parce que t'en as jamais eu !
On déclenche une bagarre,
on va au trou.
Je suis déjà allé au trou.
Ça me fait pas peur.
Dans ton état,
tu risques de t'enrhumer.
Si tu meurs,
j'aurai trop de paperasse.
Très drôle !
Il vous reste
6 semaines de chimio.
Vous resterez à l'hôpital
jusqu'à la fin.
Emmenez-le.
Comment ça va ?
Physiquement, bien.
Mais depuis que je suis sorti
pour l'opération,
le fait d'être dehors,
je pense qu'à une chose :
être libre,
faire ce qui me manque,
ce que je peux pas faire ici.
Par exemple ?
Quoi ?
Embrasser.
Votre femme vous manque.
Je manque d'affection,
sous n'importe quelle forme.
Avant l'opération,
vous m'avez pris la main.
J'ai senti
la chaleur de votre peau.
Un feu m'a parcouru le corps.
C'est drôle.
Une chose toute simple,
des doigts
qui touchent des doigts...
J'ai envie de vous toucher.
J'ai envie de vous embrasser.
Non !
Ça ne va pas ?
Pourquoi ça n'irait pas ?
Je suis psychologue
et religieuse.
Entre les deux,
ça cloche souvent.
En fac de médecine,
on nous rabâchait une chose.
Ne pas montrer d'émotions.
Garder ses distances.
Ne pas se lier avec un patient.
Je peux savoir lequel ?
Ryan O'Reilly.
Pourquoi êtes-vous
attirée par lui ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il est beau.
Il a le charme des Irlandais.
Et le cancer du sein.
Ma mère l'a eu.
Ma tante, ma sœur...
Je l'aurai sûrement aussi.
Je sais ce qu'il éprouve.
Ce n'est pas de l'amour,
mais de l'empathie.
Vous voulez un conseil ?
Faites l'amour avec votre mari,
oubliez ces sentiments
pour O'Reilly,
sinon vous aurez des ennuis.
La cicatrice sera petite.
Et vos nausées ?
Disparues.
Votre appétit ?
Revenu.
- De la fatigue ?
- Embrassez-moi.
Vous savez ce que je sais,
vous éprouvez ce que j'éprouve.
Ramenez-le à Em City.
<i>Regarde-moi, jeune fille,</i>
<i>laisse-moi
polluer tes pensées.</i>
J'enlèverai ton vernis.
Fais voir
ce qu'il y a dessous.
Tu pisses.
J'essaie.
J'ai envie de pisser.
Tu veux vraiment t'évader
en creusant ?
On m'appelle la Taupe.
Je suis sorti d'une banque
en creusant
à 7 m. de profondeur.
Et ton offre
de me laisser te suivre ?
En partant,
je me retournerai pas.
Je vois. Si on creuse à deux,
ça va plus vite, non ?
Bien sûr.
J'étais architecte.
Je connais la construction.
Je t'aiderai.
Bonjour, William.
Navrée pour les entraves.
Peter, Peter Marie.
Je suis venue
pour qu'on parle.
Broom.
Broom. Vous m'avez dit ça
la dernière fois.
Sick.
Vous me l'avez dit aussi.
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Sick et broom...
Amore.
Que voulez-vous me dire ?
Sick,
broom,
amore.
Sick...
Ça va !
Ça va !
Calmez-vous.
Ça va aller, William.
Allons-y tout doucement,
d'accord ?
On a tout notre temps.
Street.
Street ?
Avenue ?
Street.
On devrait commencer
la réunion par une prière.
Prier ne signifie rien
si la foi n'est pas sincère.
Si on parlait plutôt de cul ?
Oui, les visites conjugales !
J'y travaille,
mais ce sera long.
Ensuite ?
J'ai une plainte.
Vas-y.
Il y a des mecs qui puent.
Certains viennent
de pays lointains
où on se lave pas. Mais ici,
se laver
devrait être obligatoire.
Lave-toi de temps en temps !
Tu veux me laver, petit Nino ?
Ça te plairait,
de me savonner, hein ?
Le voilà, ton putain de bain !
La réunion est ajournée.
Adebisi,
retourne dans ta cellule.
Scibetta, dans mon bureau.
Miguel !
Assieds-toi.
J'ai peu de temps.
Toi et moi,
on a beaucoup en commun.
Je crois pas.
Tous les deux,
on a du sang latin, on deale.
Moi,
c'est l'héroïne, la marijuana.
Toi, tu bosses à l'hôpital,
tu vends des médicaments.
Je crois
qu'on devrait s'allier.
Non, merci.
J'accepte de faire 60-40.
Je gagne bien plus que toi.
Pourquoi tu serais si généreux ?
Je veux la mort d'Adebisi.
Tu me prends pour un crétin ?
Tu me proposes 60-40
pour que je le tue ?
Demande-lui de le faire !
Ils savent
que je déteste Adebisi.
Mais personne te soupçonnera.
C'est des conneries.
Je sais ce que tu dis :
le Latino tue le bamboula,
c'est la guerre.
Je t'en veux pas.
Mais va te faire foutre !
J'ai réfléchi.
C'est pas dans tes habitudes.
Si on s'associait ?
Putain, c'est mon jour de chance.
Tout le monde veut m'aider.
Laisse-moi deviner.
Tu veux que je le tue ?
Il y a une règle :
on tue pas les caïds.
Rien à foutre !
Scibetta, c'est pas Nino.
Il a pas de couilles.
Toi non plus.
Te laisse pas faire !
Le Rital et lui
en ont plus pour longtemps.
On va prendre un fauteuil,
s'asseoir, se détendre,
et les regarder tomber. Pigé ?
Ensuite, on ramasse les morceaux.
D'accord ?
Allez, profitez-en, les gars.
Vous devez vous dire :
"Un garçon rencontre une fille,
toujours la même histoire !"
Il y a des variantes.
Un garçon rencontre un chien.
Le garçon perd le chien,
il en achète un autre.
Ou une fille rencontre un psy.
La fille en prend
pour 10 ans de thérapie.
A Oz, il y a aussi :
un garçon rencontre un garçon.
Détenu matricule 98K14,
Christophe Keller.
Condamné le 16 juin 98
pour meurtre,
tentatives de meurtre,
agression à main armée,
conduite sous l'emprise
de stupéfiants.
Peine : 88 ans.
Conditionnelle
au bout de 50 ans.
Hill, tu changes de cellule.
Pourquoi ?
McManus ne veut pas
d'attachement entre détenus.
Qui le remplace ?
Un nouveau.
Chris Keller, Tobias Beecher.
Il te mettra au parfum
pour Em City.
Tu es pédé ?
Non, et toi ?
Je fais ce que j'ai à faire.
"S'il y a des rats, attrape-les."
"S'il y a des vaches, cours !"
"Si le chat boit ton lait,
arrête-le !"
"Si la montagne est en feu,
cours !"
Tu es la nouvelle fiotte ?
Ça sera 10$ pour téléphoner.
Quoi ?
10$ pour entrer là-dedans.
Vraiment ?
Mon nez !
Que se passe-t-il ?
À l'infirmerie.
Je te revaudrai ça.
J'ai pas fait ça pour toi.
Je déteste ces cons d'aryens.
J'ai rencontré le juge Lema.
Comment va cette conne ?
Elle m'a parlé de toi.
La conne m'a envoyé ici,
la conne m'a donné le maximum.
Elle voudrait te voir.
Quelle conne !
Mon procès a duré 28 jours.
Et chaque jour,
j'ai dû regarder cette conne
frapper avec son marteau
et demander au jury
de me niquer.
J'avais pas le choix,
je devais voir cette conne.
Maintenant, j'y suis pas obligé.
Si.
Vous allez m'y forcer ?
Oui.
Pourquoi ?
Ce sera thérapeutique.
Tu me remercieras.
Vous savez quoi ?
Vous aussi, vous êtes un connard.
M. Beecher,
merci de m'accorder
un peu de votre temps.
Ça me repose,
plutôt que de me faire enculer.
Ce n'est rien.
Parlez librement.
Au procès,
vous n'avez pas pu le faire.
Ça aurait changé quelque chose ?
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Je suis juge depuis 16 ans.
J'ai rendu 2 500 jugements,
bons pour la plupart.
Mais un seul me hante :
le vôtre.
Je me suis toujours vantée
d'être juste.
Dans mon tribunal,
la justice est aveugle.
Mais dans votre cas,
cette petite fille,
ses parents en larmes,
le fait que vous soyez avocat,
votre première arrestation
pour conduite en état d'ivresse,
l'absurdité de tout cela...
j'ai été dépassée.
Je me suis emportée,
j'ai été dure au point...
de douter
de la justesse de mon jugement.
A vous voir comme ça,
je me dis que la peine
a dépassé le délit
et je suis...
Vous êtes quoi ? Désolée ?
Vous avez tout fait
pour m'anéantir.
Mais la vérité, c'est que
j'ai tué Cathy Rockwell.
J'ai eu beau manipuler
le système judicaire
pour m'en tirer,
j'ai quand même pris sa vie.
Selon la loi,
tout crime mérite punition.
Vous m'avez donné le maximum,
15 ans dans ce trou !
C'est trop ? Pas assez ?
Je sais pas.
Ce que vous avez fait vous hante ?
Moi aussi.
Si vous êtes venue
pour que je vous pardonne,
vous vous trompez d'homme.
Il a cessé d'exister
en même temps que Cathy Rockwell.
Il ne vous donnera pas
plus de paix
qu'elle ne m'en donne.
Ça a été très thérapeutique.
Merci.
Je suis désolée.
Lâche-moi !
Bas les pattes, sale tapette !
Comment ça va ?
Se doucher avec ce truc,
c'est chiant.
Hier soir, je t'ai insulté...
Laisse tomber.
Je connais les cauchemars.
Tu m'as aidé
pour le téléphone et je t'ai dit
que je te revaudrais ça.
Toi et moi,
on est différent des autres.
Les Latinos,
les blacks, les aryens,
ils s'entraident.
Toi et moi,
on est là, la bite à l'air.
On devrait se soutenir,
se faire confiance.
J'ai du mal à faire confiance.
Moi aussi.
Mais on a tout notre temps.
Alors, on verra bien.
Enculé !
Du calme.
Cet enfoiré m'a pété le nez !
Cogne !
Pousse-toi.
Tout va bien.
Ça suffit.
Comment marche l'Opération Toby ?
Ça sera long,
mais Beecher sera à moi.
Un garçon rencontre une fille.
Le garçon tire son coup.
Pourquoi on a envie
de quelqu'un ?
<i>La couleur des yeux ?
Le galbe des jambes ?</i>
<i>Les talons aiguilles ?</i>
<i>Ou comme le dit le Poète,</i>
<i>quelque chose de plus profond,
un égarement partagé ?</i>
<i>La quête de quelqu'un
qui mesure</i>
<i>notre tristesse.</i>
<i>Certains passent leur vie
à chercher cette personne.</i>
<i>Certains la trouvent,
d'autres pas.</i>
<i>Certains se persuadent
qu'ils sont amoureux.</i>
À Oz, la plupart du temps,
l'illusion vaut mieux
que la réalité.

HISTOIRE DE FAMILLE
Saison 2, Episode 5
La famille !
Elle détermine ce qu'on est
et ce qu'on n'est pas.
Toutes nos relations avec les gens
qu'on rencontrera dans notre vie
sont conditionnées par nos rapports
avec les membres de notre famille !
Pas étonnant que le monde
tourne ŕ l'envers !
Saďd...
J'ai lu ton livre.
Je ne rembourse pas.
Il m'a plu.
Je t'assure.
Que veux-tu ?
Pareil que toi.
Je vois lŕ un homme
qui veut baiser le systčme,
utiliser la loi contre elle-męme.
C'est ce que je veux aussi.
Je suis accusé de complot pour meurtre.
Le procčs approche.
J'ai viré mon avocat.
Je veux que tu me défendes.
Je suis sérieux.
Réfléchis.
Si Kareem Saďd
me croit innocent,
le jury le croira aussi.
Et si tu défends un Blanc
avec mon genre de convictions,
tu stupéfieras Glynn et McManus,
tu ébranleras le monde extérieur.
Tu seras le symbole
d'une justice impartiale,
indifférente ŕ la race,
affranchie de tout préjugé.
Qu'en dis-tu ?
J'y réfléchirai.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Tu touches ŕ mes počmes ?
Tu te crois drôle ?
Je vais t'apprendre ŕ déchirer
mes počmes !
Vous crępez pas
le chignon, les filles.
C'est le troisičme incident
en trois semaines.
Visiblement, le message
n'est pas passé.
Ŕ partir d'aujourd'hui,
notre pacte est annulé.
Tu retournes en cuisine
laver les sols.
Rien ŕ foutre.
Oublie la cérémonie des diplômes.
Tu pourras aller en classe,
mais pas ŕ la remise des diplômes.
Ma nana et ma mčre viennent.
Décommande-les.
Tu dois te tenir ŕ carreau.
- Il déchirait mes počmes.
- Quand bien męme.
Tu es publié.
Un tas de gens trčs importants,
d'écrivains connus, se sont battus
pour que ton cas soit réexaminé.
Tu vas passer devant la commission.
Un incident peut tout gâcher.
Il paraît que tu ne suis plus
le programme de désintoxication.
Je passe l'éponge lŕ-dessus.
Tu sais pourquoi ?
Tu donnes une bonne image d'Oz.
Fais quoi que ce soit qui la ternisse
et c'est fini pour toi.
Prisonnier matricule 96J332,
Arnold Jackson.
M. Jackson, mes questions
seront basées
sur le rapport préparatoire
et sur votre dossier carcéral.
J'adresserai ensuite
un avis au président de la commission.
Nos propos sont enregistrés
au cas oů vous voudriez
faire appel de la décision.
Des questions ?
Non.
Votre attention !
Bonne nouvelle !
Vous vous fiancez ?
Le Počte a eu sa conditionnelle.
Tu seras libéré juste aprčs
la remise des diplômes.
McManus et moi
l'avons choisi pour
prononcer l'allocution.
L'allo-cul-quoi ?
Félicitations.
On tenait ŕ vous l'annoncer ici
pour tous vous encourager.
Le Počte
a été récompensé.
Vous pouvez tous l'ętre.
Travaillez dur.
Allez, les gars, au boulot.
Qui connaît le mot "allocution" ?
Ça fera du bien ŕ McManus.
Lui aussi a besoin de retourner
ŕ l'école... de la réalité.
Bonjour, Tim.
Gouverneur...
C'est quoi ?
Une attaque en traître ?
- Assieds-toi.
- Non, merci.
Quel mauvais vent vous amčne ?
Je vous donne trois indices :
diplôme d'études secondaires.
L'État a décidé
de supprimer ce programme
du budget de l'an prochain.
Vous n'avez pas le droit.
- Ça marche. Avec le temps...
- On n'en a pas.
On a besoin de plus de gardiens.
Le budget ne peut pas tout couvrir.
Sauf s'il y avait moins de détenus,
ce qui sera le cas
avec notre programme...
Je donnerai une conférence
de presse le 15.
En attendant, ceci doit
rester confidentiel.
Le 15 ? C'est trois jours
aprčs la remise des diplômes.
Comme ça,
la cérémonie n'en pâtira pas.
Vous venez ŕ la cérémonie ?
Malheureusement, oui.
Relations publiques obligent.
Ne sortez pas l'artillerie lourde.
Ça distrairait les détenus.
Il n'y aura que le cameraman
et moi-męme.
On n'est pas CNN.
Du moins, pas encore.
La durée du reportage ?
Ça dépend du reste de l'actualité.
Entre 45 secondes et 3 minutes.
Je veux 3 minutes.
Ils ont travaillé dur.
Ils le méritent.
Le public doit savoir
qu'on fait de bonnes choses.
On se voit le 12.
M. le Gouverneur, M. le Directeur,
diplômés, parents, amis...
je suis trčs fier
d'ętre devant vous aujourd'hui
pour célébrer
non seulement la réussite scolaire
individuelle de ces hommes,
mais aussi la victoire commune
ŕ laquelle chaque personne ici
a contribué.
Ces étudiants m'ont appris
que ce diplôme
participait d'un projet plus large :
changer de vie
et ne jamais regarder en arričre.
Aussi suis-je au regret
de vous annoncer
que c'est peut-ętre
la derničre promotion.
Le nouveau budget
qui va ętre voté ŕ l'Assemblée
sonnera le glas de ce programme.
Cette décision tragique
ne touchera pas
les diplômés d'aujourd'hui,
mais leurs durs efforts
ont laissé un héritage
qui disparaîtra inévitablement.
Comme le disait si bien
Chuck D. :
"Méfiez-vous des apparences."
Je vous présente notre major :
Arnold Jackson, dit Le Počte.
Trop de geôles et pas assez d'écoles.
Trop de fusils et pas assez d'outils.
Pas assez d'enseignants
et trop d'ignorants.
Mais moi, je viens
d'oů la bagarre est née,
d'oů la nuit est tombée.
Je suis fait de la lie
que le Soleil a vomie.
J'ai pactisé avec le numéro un,
le début de l'alphabet,
le patron minet,
le savoir, l'espoir, le vouloir,
l'eau, l'arbrisseau,
la souffrance, l'endurance,
le cou qui élance...
la plante du pied meurtrie,
la cuisse endolorie,
l'éclat du regard,
intrigué par ce qu'il voit,
éprouvé par ce en quoi il croit.
J'ai vu le simulacre de l'amour,
le port de la haine,
l'enfer ici-bas
et la beauté de l'au-delŕ.
J'ai pressenti la malédiction
et bu du Dom Pérignon
et l'Armageddon.
J'ai bu l'ambroisie sacrée
dans le calice de l'ange rebelle
sous la forme de jus de fruits.
Je suis mort édenté
et j'ai ressuscité 144 000 fois.
J'ai 144 000 rimes en moi
pour chaque cellule du cerveau,
mais ma cellule est un tombeau.
Merci.
Mesdames et messieurs,
voici la promotion 1998.
Luis Batista.
Arnold Jackson.
Timmy Kirk...
Chouette cérémonie, hein ?
Vous avez raté la collation.
Vous vous croyez si intelligent !
Me faire venir ici
pour m'embarrasser en public.
C'était effectivement l'idée.
Vous me croyez vulnérable, hein ?
Avec ma femme qui me quitte,
les accusations de corruption,
mon impopularité
aprčs l'envoi de la brigade
lors des émeutes.
Je vous ai sauvé la mise,
soit dit en passant.
Vous me croyez ŕ bout,
pas vrai ?
Je suis un homme simple.
Pas moi.
Il y a un an, mes ennemis pensaient
que je serais destitué,
car, comme vous,
ils me sous-estimaient,
ainsi que les électeurs.
Les électeurs m'aiment
et me détestent ŕ la fois.
Ils me savent tyrannique,
doutent de mon honnęteté
et pensent que j'ai trompé ma femme.
Mais la criminalité baisse.
Les impôts aussi.
L'emploi, en revanche, augmente.
Le revenu moyen aussi.
Les Knights se sont qualifiés.
Męme le ballet attire les foules.
Quant ŕ l'éducation,
on a le deuxičme taux d'alphabétisation
du pays.
Alors, pensez-vous sérieusement
que l'Américain moyen se soucie
qu'un petit voyou toxico
obtienne un diplôme,
quand leurs petits chéris vont ŕ Yale ?
Bonne collation.
Vous voyez ?
Les gens font ce qu'ils font
pour se venger de leur pčre !
Ils en veulent ŕ leur mčre
de leur avoir mal appris
ŕ aller sur le pot.
Ils veulent leur faire payer
de les avoir mis au monde.
Vilain bébé !
Salut.
Que veux-tu, Wangler ?
Tu sors aujourd'hui ?
Ouais, je sors aujourd'hui.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
J'ai entendu ton počme ŕ la cérémonie.
Il m'a plu.
Je t'ai vraiment fait chier
ces temps-ci.
En te traitant de pédale,
en me moquant de tes počmes.
Mais t'es doué. Vraiment doué.
Merci, mec.
C'est moche que t'aies pas pu
assister ŕ la cérémonie.
Ŕ cause de cet enculé de McManus.
J'ai dű tout expliquer ŕ ma nana.
J'ai pas eu le courage
d'appeler ma mčre.
Elle était si fičre
que j'aie appris ŕ lire.
Je lui en ai tellement fait baver.
Je me demandais si avant de partir,
tu pourrais lui écrire une lettre,
pour lui dire que je suis désolé.
Tu peux le faire toi-męme.
Toi, t'as les mots.
Moi, j'ai pas les mots.
Le vocabulaire.
En échange...
je te file ça.
D'accord.
T'as fait tes sacs ?
J'ai décidé de ne rien emporter d'ici.
Pas de dernier repas ?
Pas d'adieux ŕ personne ?
Juste salut et bon courage.
Tu sais, ça la fout un peu mal de partir
quand tous les autres restent.
C'est comme sortir d'un ręve.
"L'espoir est ręve éveillé."
C'est de Mahomet ?
Aristote.
Cet enculé n'est jamais allé ŕ Oz.
Ta mčre est lŕ.
Un grand merci...
ŕ tous les deux.
Shirley, t'es la plus jolie fille
du couloir de la mort.
Merci d'ętre venu.
Je serais venu de toute façon.
Je n'ai jamais été portée
sur la religion.
Baptęme luthérien,
études chez les Quakers...
Mon premier mari était juif,
le second...
machin-chose.
Machin-chose ?
Quand on ne croit en rien.
Athée.
Vous ętes athée ?
Depuis l'accident,
j'éprouve toutes sortes de sentiments.
L'accident ?
Quand ma fille est morte...
Sauvez-moi.
Vous le voulez ?
Je veux que vous me sauviez.
De quoi ? De l'enfer ?
De l'injection mortelle ?
Ce col est si rigide.
Vous devriez l'ôter.
Arrętez !
Gardien !
Regardez-moi.
Je suis complčtement paumée !
Je suis désolée.
Ŕ Oz,
on voit peu sa vraie famille,
ses parents par le sang.
Parfois, ce qu'on fait en taule,
on le fait pour eux,
pour les faire vivre,
les garder autour de nous,
męme si c'est que dans la tęte.
Regardez qui est lŕ !
En visite dans les bas quartiers ?
Ton transfert n'implique pas
que je ne me soucie pas de toi.
Mon cul !
J'étais obligé d'écouter
tes sermons ŕ Em City.
Mais plus maintenant.
Salut.
Ok, je me fiche de ton sort.
La voix de la franchise !
J'aimerais qu'on parle de ton allégation
selon laquelle Wittlesey a tiré
sur Scott Ross durant l'émeute.
Mon allégation ?
Je l'ai vue tuer Ross.
Raconte-moi tout en détail.
Vous vous protégez mutuellement.
Tu enterreras la vérité.
Pas cette fois.
Tim...
Ma fille est en ville.
Ma mčre étant ŕ l'hôpital,
elle ne peut plus s'en occuper.
J'ai une amie qui habite prčs d'ici.
Elle garde DeeDee deux,
trois jours par semaine.
C'est bien.
Vu que tu voulais la connaître
et que je lui ai parlé de toi,
on pourrait dîner ensemble.
Rien que nous trois.
Je t'invite.
Saloperie de machine ŕ la con !
Y a donc rien qui marche
dans cette putain de taule ?
Du calme, ce n'est qu'un distributeur.
Il m'a bouffé mon dollar.
Il y a un numéro sur le côté.
Appelle-le.
Saloperie !
Tu te sens mieux ?
Oui.
Beaucoup mieux.
Je ne peux pas venir au poker.
Pourquoi ?
Je dîne avec Diane et sa gosse.
Vous deux, c'est un jour oui, un jour non.
C'est vraiment fini.
Pourquoi ?
Timmy, t'es le type
le plus transparent de la plančte.
Tu l'évites depuis l'émeute,
depuis que Case et sa commission
ont commencé ŕ fouiner.
Elle est venue ŕ l'hôpital.
Elle m'a bien aidé.
Alors, que s'est-il passé ?
Laisse tomber.
Tim, depuis quand on se connaît ?
Tu ne me fais pas confiance ?
J'ai lu et relu le rapport
de la commission.
Je suis peut-ętre fou
mais je doute que Scott Ross
soit mort comme ça.
Je crois...
qu'il a été assassiné.
Sans blague ?
Par Diane.
- Allons !
- Je le sais.
- Tu as des preuves ?
- Non.
Mais Schillinger l'a vue.
Au diable Schillinger !
En tout cas, quand je lui ai demandé,
elle m'a menti.
Qu'en sais-tu ?
Quand tu couches avec quelqu'un,
tu le sais.
Je dois y aller.
Joey, est-ce que Diane est lŕ ?
- Tu es pręte ?
- Quasiment.
Je vais ętre franche.
Je sais que tu as des doutes
sur ce qu'il s'est passé avec Scott Ross.
Tu te rappelles son regard
quand il a tiré ?
Oui.
Tu te souviens de la suite ?
Non, de rien.
Moi-męme, j'ai du mal.
C'est allé si vite.
Mais j'ai fait ça
parce qu'il t'avait tiré dessus.
Il voulait ta mort.
- Ça justifie ton acte ?
- Oui.
Si je te donne raison,
je renie tout ce en quoi je crois,
tous mes principes.
Je ne te demande rien.
Je dis juste qu'on ne vit pas
dans le męme monde.
Pour nous,
la nécessité passe avant les idéaux.
- Voilŕ ta maman.
- Salut, ma puce.
Voici DeeDee.
On dîne toujours ensemble ?
Non.
Salut, Augustus.
Ton linge est vraiment sale.
Nettoie.
Passez aux aveux.
- Tu sais tenir ta langue ?
- Oui.
Mais en ai-je envie ?
Que veux-tu en échange ?
Un mois de lessive.
- Une semaine.
- Trois.
- Deux.
- Deux et demie.
On creuse un tunnel.
Pour s'évader.
Désolé.
Quand tu le disais,
je croyais que tu déconnais.
Ça paraît fou...
mais c'est possible.
On se relaie
la nuit.
Puis on remet le carrelage.
Et vous éliminez la terre
en lavant le linge.
C'est une idée de Rebadow.
Bravo.
- Ça te dit ?
- Moi ?
Y aura un accčs pour handicapés ?
Votre secret ne craint rien avec moi.
Pliez bien mon linge quand il sera sec.
Ainsi, tu veux tuer Adebisi ?
- Simple rumeur.
- Joue pas au malin.
S'il lui arrive quoi que ce soit,
je te le ferais payer.
Vous oubliez votre dette envers moi.
Ce chantage va durer longtemps ?
Tant qu'on sera dans ce zoo.
J'apprécie votre esprit de famille.
Vous aimez ce boulot,
mais la famille passe avant.
Je crois qu'on s'est tout dit.
Gardien !
Les grands frčres.
En déconnant les premiers,
ils préparent le terrain.
Quoi de neuf, petit frčre ?
Salut, Mark.
Viens.
Assieds-toi.
Quoi ?
T'as ta voix de baryton.
C'est signe que quelque chose ne va pas.
C'est Scibetta.
Je ne peux plus te protéger.
Qu'a-t-il dit ?
Ou il obtient ce qu'il veut
ou tu vas en taule.
Sale enculé de Rital !
C'e n'est pas lui, le fautif, c'est toi.
C'est parti pour un sermon !
Je ne voulais tuer personne,
juste me faire un peu de fric.
Que faites-vous ?
Pitié !
Gisante m'a dit de tirer.
Tu l'as tué, un point c'est tout.
Scibetta me fait chanter avec ça.
Tu dois te rendre.
Tu veux rire ?
Il le faut, Mark.
Tu as tué un homme.
Tu vas me laisser plonger
pour garder ta place ?
Tu vas me laisser payer pour toi ?
Je vis dans le mensonge.
Je risque la peine de mort.
Si je te protčge,
qui sait jusqu'oů Scibetta ira ?
Combien d'autres gens mourront ?
Je suis désolé, Leo.
Il m'a dit de tirer.
S'il te plaît, ne me fais pas ça.
Tu te l'es fait toi-męme, Mark.
Ŕ présent, tu dois te rendre.
Je t'accompagnerai si tu veux...
mais tu dois te rendre.
J'ai foutu de la mort-aux-rats.
Fallait mettre des pičges.
Ils vont crever dans les murs.
Ça va puer pendant une semaine.
Non que tu sentes ce qui pue.
Petit Nino, quand tu dis
des trucs comme ça,
ça fait mal.
Je veux juste qu'on soit amis.
Amis ?
Ok, mon pote, si tu me ramenais
une tablette de chocolat ?
Avec plaisir.
Pas de problčme.
Enculé !
J'ai réfléchi ŕ ta proposition
de liquider Scibetta.
Tu le feras ?
Non. Mais ça change rien
ŕ notre business.
J'ai une info qui peut t'ętre utile.
Scibetta sait un truc sur le dirlo.
J'ignore quoi,
mais j'ai le sentiment
que Glynn pleurerait pas sa mort.
Si je le tue, ils enquęteront.
Mets-le juste hors circuit,
le temps que Glynn
puisse faire le ménage.
Hé, papi...
toi et moi...
on est ŕ l'unisson.
J'ai pris des cours de chant
exprčs pour ça.
Tiens.
Encore un peu.
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
Scibetta vomissait et pissait du sang.
Ŕ mon avis, on l'a empoisonné.
Seigneur !
Je veux Adebisi.
Je veux que vous me le livriez.
Non.
S'il est coupable, je le punirais.
Ne m'appelle pas Leo !
C'est une menace ou une blague ?
Mon frčre va se rendre.
Toi et moi, c'est fini.
Quel bon vent vous amčne ?
Scibetta est hors jeu.
Débarrassez le plancher.
- On dirige la cuisine.
- Faux.
Vous ętes réaffectés
ŕ l'usine de robes.
L'usine ? Pas question !
On se reverra.
Envoie-moi une robe.
Vous voyez, un peu de poison...
et tous les rats s'en vont.
Si je prouve que c'est toi,
tu dégageras aussi.
Les Jackson Five.
Les frčres Kennedy.
Les Marx Brothers.
Des frčres unis,
ça donne des trucs épatants.
Quand c'est pas le cas...
c'est vraiment la merde.
Tu dois casquer 10 $ pour entrer.
Ah oui ?
Tu m’as pété le nez !
Attends lŕ.
Le docteur va arriver.
Pourquoi t'es lŕ ?
Pour mon nez.
- Je suis désolé.
- Tu peux !
On va me l'enlever.
Mon bras est guéri.
Qu'est-ce que j'en ai ŕ foutre ?
Je me suis excusé.
Si j'avais fait semblant,
Beecher n'y aurait pas cru.
Je te revaudrai ça.
Schillinger dit qu'on doit faire équipe.
Mais quand Beecher sera mort,
on réglera nos comptes.
Quand tu veux, bébé.
Il est ŕ vous.
Votre bras.
Trčs drôle.
T'as jamais fait de lutte ?
Une fois, au lycée.
Mais quand j'ai entendu
l'os d'un type se briser,
je me suis tiré.
Je te casserai rien.
Ta jambe d'appui en arričre.
- C'est laquelle ?
- On va voir ça.
Tu saisis le type ŕ la taille,
tu le tires, tu le fais basculer
et tu le plaques.
Tu m'as attrapé le cou !
J'avais oublié de te parler de ça !
On recommence.
Doucement.
Bien joué.
- Tu m'as laissé gagner.
- Non.
Je sais bien que si.
La prochaine fois, je t'aurai.
Allez, on recommence.
Ce jeu est débile.
Attends un peu avant de dire ça.
T'as pas le droit.
Y a trop de rčgles !
Pas de roque en échec.
La lutte aussi a ses rčgles.
Je joue ça.
J'ai ŕ te parler.
- T'as fait une connerie ?
- Non. Quand on en fait une,
il nous convoque dans son bureau.
Lŕ, il a une mauvaise nouvelle.
Eh bien ?
Je le dis devant lui ?
Ouais.
Ta femme... est morte.
Quoi ?
Elle s'est suicidée.
Seigneur !
Comment ?
Par asphyxie.
Elle s'est enfermée dans le garage
et a laissé le moteur tourner.
Et les gosses ?
Ils vont bien.
- Oů sont-ils ?
- Avec ta famille.
Je veux les voir.
Ils viendront demain.
Je suis désolé.
Si je peux t'aider...
A-t-elle laissé un mot ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je parie qu'elle en a laissé un.
Je me renseignerai.
Tu veux continuer ?
Tu veux aller lutter ?
Tu veux que je te laisse seul ?
Je suis désolé.
Vraiment désolé.
Si tu veux pleurer, vas-y.
Personne ne regarde.
Tout va bien.
Le courrier !
Tobias...
t'as du courrier.
Une enveloppe Cartier !
Paraît que ta femme s'est tuée.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Seigneur !
C'est de Genevieve.
Elle dit que c'est ma faute...
que je l'ai tuée,
comme cette fillette.
Toby...
Oů sont-ils ?
Dans la salle de jeux.
Toby, attends.
Quoi, grand-mčre ?
Ce sont eux qui l'ont trouvée.
Alors, vas-y en douceur.
Ils ne t'ont pas vu depuis un an.
Et puis, cet endroit...
On n'aurait pas dű venir.
Ils sont encore sous le choc.
Tu ne veux pas que je les voie ?
Ce n'est pas ça...
Mais ce n'est pas l'endroit,
pas le moment.
Je comprends.
Ramčne-les ŕ la maison.
Foutez le camp d'ici !
Qu'y a-t-il ?
J'ai gâché ma vie.
J'ai complčtement gâché ma vie.
Je suis tout seul.
Non, t'est pas seul.
Ça va aller.
Me touche pas !
Maris et femmes !
On cherche l'amour inconditionnel
de nos parents.
Ne pouvant l'obtenir,
on trouve quelqu'un,
n'importe qui,
et on l'épouse.
Et on passe sa vie ŕ s'engueuler,
ŕ essayer de prouver ŕ l'autre
qu'il n'a jamais mérité cet amour
une seule seconde !
On paie pour des crimes
qu'on n'a jamais commis.
Salope !
Enfoiré !
Ma voiture m'a lâché.
Le moteur fume.
Vous m'emmenez au presbytčre ?
Pete !
Salut, Ray.
Je vous laisse.
Entrez. Peut-ętre pouvez-vous...
Regardez.
Ce sont les mots que William Giles
n'arręte pas
de me répéter.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
Aucune idée. J'ai tout essayé
pour l'inciter ŕ parler,
mais...
Je me suis dit qu'en les écrivant,
je trouverais peut-ętre un lien.
Amore veut dire amour, sick, malade...
J'ai essayé ça.
Sick, amore...
Sycamore.
Street.
Sycamore Street.
Broome Street.
Sycamore Street, Broome Street.
Qu'est-il arrivé ŕ ce carrefour ?
C'est lŕ que mon mari a été tué.
Ouvrez sa cellule.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Ouvrez !
Vous ne pouvez entrer
que s'il est menotté.
Je n'ai pas le temps d'attendre.
Écoutez
le son de ma voix.
Laissez-moi entrer.
Avez-vous tué mon mari ?
C'est ça que vous vouliez me dire ?
Ce sont des aveux en morse ?
Alors, quoi ?
Quoi ?
Peter... Peter Marie...
Non, de grâce, ne recommencez pas !
Mon mari est mort
au carrefour Sycamore-Broome.
Quelqu'un l'a poussé
de l'arričre d'un camion.
C'était vous ?
Non.
Yeux.
Vous l'avez vu se faire pousser ?
Oui.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Boum... Crac...
Clac !
Oui, il s'est brisé le cou.
Mais que s'est-il passé avant ?
Qui l'a poussé ?
Je vous en supplie...
Qui l'a poussé ?
Aim.
Comment ça ?
C'est quoi ?
Répondez !
Parce qu'on est du męme sang,
on peut tout demander ŕ sa famille.
Tout. Mentir, tricher,
se faire descendre.
Mais pas leur emprunter leur bagnole.
Y a quand męme des limites !
O'Reilly...
Tu l'as ?
Super.
Le fric d'abord.
Je comprends
qu'on paye pour de la came,
mais pour ça...
- Qu'est-ce que tu mijotes ?
- Rien.
Pourquoi tu le voulais ?
Parce qu'il est ŕ elle.
C'est Nathan, hein ?
Si je te connaissais pas,
je dirais que t'es amoureux.
C'est si dur ŕ croire
que je puisse ętre amoureux ?
Toi, moi, n'importe qui.
Pas ŕ Oz, mec.
Tu te trompes.
Dr Nathan.
Que voulez-vous ?
Je me demandais pourquoi
vous n'étiez pas lŕ pour ma chimio.
L'infirmičre a les compétences requises.
Cette chimio me rend malade.
J'ai besoin d'un check-up.
Je dirai au Dr Prestopnik
de vous recevoir cet aprčs-midi.
Je veux que ce soit vous.
Je suis occupée.
- Ŕ quoi ?
- Ça ne vous regarde pas.
Je raccroche.
Ne vous fâchez pas.
Il ne faut plus m'appeler tout le temps.
Je raccroche.
Attendez.
Je vous aime.
Quel est le problčme ?
Ryan O'Reilly.
Il m'appelle
sans arręt.
Il m'écrit.
Des lettres d'amour ?
Il commence ŕ me faire peur.
Vous ne l'avez pas encouragé,
n'est-ce pas ?
Non.
Il y a quelques temps, vous disiez
qu'il vous attirait.
Je sais, mais je n'ai rien fait,
je n'ai rien dit.
J'ai juste agi en médecin.
Je vous le jure.
Vous voulez que je lui parle ?
Si ça peut aider.
On ne risque rien.
Je peux les lire ?
Bonjour, Ryan. Entrez.
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
Il y a des hauts et des bas.
Ça ne m'étonne pas.
Vous avez été mis ŕ rude épreuve.
Le cancer, l'opération, la chimio.
Ce n'est pas facile ŕ gérer.
Je me débrouille.
Ce que je veux dire...
c'est que votre vie était en danger.
Ŕ présent, vos chances de guérison
sont excellentes.
Du coup, toute cette peur
que vous avez éprouvée
doit ętre remplacée par autre chose.
Par d'autres émotions,
comme vos sentiments
pour le Dr Nathan.
Vous semblez obnubilé
par elle ces temps-ci.
Elle m'a sauvé la vie.
Bien sűr,
mais on prend facilement
la reconnaissance pour de l'affection.
Vous doutez de mes sentiments ?
Je suis sűre que vous ętes sincčre.
Mais le Dr Nathan...
voit les choses autrement.
Si vous tenez ŕ elle, Ryan,
vous devez respecter cela.
Il faut arręter de lui écrire,
de l'appeler.
Parfois, j'ai juste besoin
d'entendre sa voix.
Je comprends.
Mais...
elle ne veut pas entendre la vôtre.
Ryan, l'amour, le vrai,
est réciproque.
Les deux personnes
doivent s'aimer autant.
Quand la moitié
de cette équation manque...
Écoutez-moi. Quand la moitié
de l'équation manque,
ce n'est plus de l'amour,
mais de l'obsession.
Vous vous trompez.
Ce que je ressens pour elle...
est la chose la plus sincčre
 la plus belle,
qui me soit jamais arrivée
dans toute ma putain de vie.
Vous ne m'enlčverez pas ça.
Je ne la mérite pas ?
Vous savez quoi ?
Dites-lui ceci :
je l'aime.
Elle peut m'envoyer
chez des tas de psy,
me jeter au trou
pendant un million d'années,
ça ne changera pas
mes sentiments pour elle. Pigé ?
Merci.
- Tu sortais avec elle, hein ?
- Elle est mariée. Toi aussi.
Tu l'as baisée ?
C'était bien ?
Tu dois arręter !
Je ne peux pas !
Fais-le pour moi, Cyril.
Mais c'est mal.
Tu m'as dit
de ne plus ętre vilain.
Fais-le.
Juste cette fois.
Pour moi.
Je t'aime, frangin.
Moi aussi.
- Vous vouliez me voir ?
- Asseyez-vous.
La police vient d'appeler.
Ils ont découvert un cadavre.
Celui de votre mari.
Mon mari ?
Il a été assassiné.
Mon Dieu !
Parfois,
je me souviens d'une chose
que j'ai faite enfant
ou d'un truc que m'a fait
mon pčre, mon frčre ou un cousin.
Des coups, une humiliation.
Et j'ai l'impression
que c'est arrivé ŕ un autre
il y a des sičcles.
Je me demande męme
si ça s'est vraiment produit.
On ne peut pas bâtir sa vie
sur des impressions de petit garçon,
sur de vagues réminiscences.
Il faut oublier toute cette merde.
Il faut recommencer ŕ zéro.
Chaque jour de sa vie,
il faut repartir ŕ zéro.

LITS JUMEAUX
Saison 2, Episode 6
Comme on fait son lit,
on se couche.
Vous voulez savoir ce
que Áa veut dire ?
<i>On s'emmerde pas ŗ lisser</i>
les draps, taper les oreillers,
pour tout g‚cher
en se couchant.
On devrait dire :
"Tu t'es couchť,
maintenant, fais ton lit."
Ce qui signifie qu'il faut Ítre
responsable de ses actes.
Responsable !
Kareem, on met pas
ta sagesse en doute...
Bravo, Vern !
mais tu parles ŗ ce nazi !
Ce nťgro ?
En dťpit de tout,
c'est un enfant de Dieu.
J'ai promis ŗ Allah de dťfendre
les droits de tous les dťtenus.
Pas seulement les Noirs.
Pas seulement ceux qui croient
au mÍme dieu que nous.
Ce nťgro va me sortir d'ici.
SaÔd reprťsente Schillinger ?
Nostradamus l'avait prťdit, non ?
Ca veut pas dire
que l'apocalypse approche ?
Vous avez plaidť contre lui.
Et j'ai gagnť.
Mais lŗ, il y aura un jury.
SaÔd est un grand orateur,
il peut ťmouvoir les jurťs.
Et aprŤs ?
Tim et vous,
vous referez une dťposition.
Il voudra savoir comment
vous avez piťgť Schillinger.
Il parlera aussi de Scott Ross.
Tenez-vous prÍte.
Ca t'inquiŤte,
d'Ítre interrogťe sur Ross ?
Non, pourquoi ?
Quand on m'a demandť
si je savais quelque chose,
j'ai dit non.
Lŗ, je peux plus.
Pourquoi ?
Depuis,
j'ai appris la vťritť.
Je serai sous serment.
Tu veux que je me parjure ?
Ce que je veux et ce que tu fais
n'ont rien ŗ voir.
On peut arrÍter ces salades ?
Tu vas me parler
de ta conscience ?
De code moral,
de fuite de ton cortex.
Et moi, je vais te dire : "Mens.
"Si tu m'aimes,
"si tu m'as aimťe,
"mens."
Schillinger m'a abordťe
devant la bibliothŤque.
Il a offert de me payer
pour tuer Beecher.
Vous avez acceptť ?
Oui, dans le but
de l'en empÍcher.
Nous avons un enregistrement.
<i>Alors, hier soir ?</i>
<i>- Tu voulais la mort de Beecher ?
- C'est Áa.</i>
<i>Tu m'as payťe 2000 $ ?</i>
C'ťtait votre 2Ťme conversation.
La prťcťdente
n'a pas ťtť enregistrťe.
Aviez-vous abordť Schillinger ?
Vous n'avez pas offert
de tuer Beecher ?
Non, l'incitation au dťlit
est illťgale.
Vous a-t-il proposť
autre chose que de l'argent ?
Il a dit que si je refusais,
il dirait que j'avais tuť Ross.
Ca vous a poussť
ŗ le piťger ?
Non, parce que c'est faux.
Quoi que Schillinger dise
ou crois avoir vu,
je n'ai tuť personne.
L'agent Wittlesey
est donc digne de confiance ?
Oui.
Elle ne vous a jamais menti ?
Je n'ai pas dit Áa.
Elle vous a donc menti.
Vous a-t-elle menti
pour Schillinger ?
Sur son intention
de tuer Beecher ?
Non.
Elle a donc dit vrai
sur ses raisons d'accepter.
Je suppose.
Vous supposez ?
Que Schillinger l'accuse
de meurtre l'a influencťe ?
M'a-t-elle dit
que c'ťtait une de ses raisons ?
Oui.
Non.
Wittlesey
a-t-elle assassinť Ross ?
A votre connaissance,
Diane Wittlesey a-t-elle tirť
sur Ross dans le but de le tuer ?
Non.
Alors ?
Ca ne marche pas.
Baisse ce truc !
Ils ont des tťmoins
et un enregistrement.
Il y a forcťment
une faille juridique !
Tu seras condamnť
pour complot de meurtre
et tu prendras 10 ans de plus.
Autant prendre perpŤte !
Je verrai jamais mes gosses.
Et le meurtre de Ross ?
Sans preuve,
ta parole ne vaut rien.
T'es  foutu !
MÍle-toi de tes affaires !
Schillinger,
je me retire de cette affaire.
Pas question.
Ca aggraverait mon cas.
Je refuse
de plaider une cause perdue.
Tu l'as fait exprŤs,
hein ? Pour me piťger.
Tu as acceptť
pour te dťsister
et faire empirer les choses.
Ca  ne pourrait pas Ítre pire.
Maintenant, j'en suis sŻr.
Tu es coupable,
vraiment coupable.
Tu t'es servi de moi.
Et toi, tu t'es servi de moi.
Tout est affaire d'ťquilibre.
Sale nťgro !
Tu as perdu l'ťquilibre, chťri !
Shakespeare,
dans son testament,
a laissť ŗ sa femme,
je n'invente rien,
son lit, "mais pas le meilleur".
<i>Shakespeare avait abandonnť
femme et enfants depuis longtemps</i>
<i>et il est revenu
juste avant sa mort.</i>
<i>Son lit, "mais pas le meilleur",</i>
<i>c'ťtait une blague
entre mari et femme</i>
ou la derniŤre provocation
de Shakespeare ?
Vous cherchez quelque chose ?
Moi si. J'ai besoin d'une amie.
Ce sera pas moi.
Bien sŻr.
J'ai ťtť condamnťe pour meurtre,
pas vous.
J'ai une question.
Tu dors bien ?
Oui.
Comment c'est possible,
vu ce que tu as fait ?
Quand on me parle
de la mort de ma fille,
je dis que c'ťtait un accident.
Mais c'ťtait pas un accident.
C'ťtait ce qui devait arriver,
ce qui devait Ítre.
Alors, je dors.
Je dors bien.
Salut, Diane !
Tiens, Shirley.
Merci, mon chou.
<i>Je t'aime</i>
<i>Moi aussi, je t'aime</i>
Peter Scibetta a bel et bien
ťtť empoisonnť.
Il quitte l'hŰpital aujourd'hui.
On a les rťsultats ?
On a trouvť de la mort-aux-rats
dans son systŤme digestif.
Qu'a-t-il mangť ?
Juste avant de se trouver mal,
il mangeait du chocolat
qu'Adebisi lui avait donnť.
C'est sŻrement le coupable.
Pourquoi ? N'importe qui
a pu mettre le poison
avant lui !
On sait tous qu'Adebisi
ne supporte pas Scibetta.
Il n'est pas le seul
ŗ ne pas supporter Scibetta !
Continuez ŗ enquÍter.
Trouvez des preuves concrŤtes
et on s'occupera d'Adebisi.
Et sinon ?
Ca fera un mystŤre de plus.
Vous voulez quoi ?
Glynn s'occupe pas de ton cas.
Je m'en chargerai.
Comment ?
Vous verrez.
Peter...
La famille est gÍnťe.
Pourquoi ?
Ils sont pas contents de toi.
Parce qu'on m'a empoisonnť ?
Ton pŤre a bouffť du verre
pendant des mois.
Quel que soit le coupable,
- surement Adebisi -
il a pris son temps
parce qu'il savait
que Nino ťtait malin.
Parce que j'ai eu du poison
au lieu de verre pilť,
je suis moins bon que papa ?
C'est ce que dit la famille.
Bon sang !
Dis-leur
que je m'occupe d'Adebisi.
Je me vengerai. D'ici ce soir,
l'un de nous deux sera mort.
Le PoŤte est ŗ la tťlť !
Avec un putain de smoking !
C'est la merde ici !
Scibetta, le plat du jour,
c'est l'arsenic !
Tu as la chiasse ?
Vos gueules !
Un  nouveau jour commence.
C'est quoi, le petit dťj ?
Des oeufs au jambon.
Encore des oeufs ?
Merde !
Viens avec moi
dans la chambre froide.
Putain de sauce au chocolat !
Salut !
Tu bosses plus ici.
Faux.
J'ai un boulot ŗ faire.
C'est jour de paie, mon pote.
Reste tranquille !
Pancamo et Scibetta
ťtaient ťvanouis.
Scibetta saigne du rectum.
Peut-Ítre un viol.
Peut-Ítre ?
Il dit qu'il sait pas,
il refuse d'en parler.
Il a trop honte pour admettre
qu'il s'est fait enculer.
Il se vengera au lieu de parler.
Je virerai le gardien
qui a laissť faire Áa.
Peter...
J'ai parlť ŗ la famille.
Tu es hors circuit.
Quelqu'un  d'autre
dirigera les opťrations
ŗ Oz.
Lenny...
Pas un mot ŗ mon pŤre.
Pas un mot ŗ mon pŤre.
Tu aurais vu Áa !
Pancamo, complŤtement sonnť.
Scibetta, les yeux grand ouverts,
en train de dťlirer.
Il a ťtť violť ?
Par qui ?
Ca va, mon pote ?
On est potes, toi et moi ?
On est pas potes !
Je voulais que tu liquides
le Rital, tu as refusť.
Te laisse pas faire.
Tu as peur de lui ?
Je t'emmerde !
J'ai peur de personne.
ArrÍtez, Áa suffit !
Je vais tuer cet enfoirť !
Non.
Quand on tue,
c'est pour une raison.
J'ai une raison.
Tu as que dalle !
C'est ta faute.
Je ferai pas la guerre
pour tes conneries.
Alors, on fait la guerre quand ?
Il te faut quoi ?

Qu'est-ce que Áa fait ?
C'est une accusation bidon.
Je suis lŗ

Trop sur quoi ?
Rebadow te mettra au parfum.
Tiens-toi bien et Áa ira.
Trop sur quoi ?
Le gouverneur Devlin.
C'est-ŗ-dire ?
Il est accro au crack.
Pas possible !
Comment tu le sais ?
A ton avis, ducon ?
Je lui en ai vendu.
Je suis le dealer du gouverneur.
Deux cartes.
Regardez-moi Áa !
Un joli carrť d'as !
Attends, j'ai un as !
Enfoirť !
Ne vous f‚chez pas !
On peut parler en privť ?
Tu aurais des informations
au sujet du gouverneur Devlin.
Des informations redoutables.
Redoutables ? Ca dťpend
comment on voit le crack.
Les ťlecteurs
n'apprťcieraient pas
que Devlin se drogue.
Je veux
que ce soit rendu public.
Je sais pas.
Ca me rapporterait quoi ?
Ce que Áa te rapporterait ?
Si on crťe un raz-de-marťe

tu peux te retrouver libre.
Comment Áa ?
J'ai des contacts
dans les mťdias.
Demain matin,
tu risques d'Ítre une cťlťbritť.
Moi, une star ?
Oui, mon frŤre.
Voilŗ ce qu'il me faut :
les dates, heures et lieux
de tes transactions avec Devlin.
Ca peut pas Ítre exact.
On a pas de registre.
Des tťmoins
peuvent soutenir ta version ?
Scat.
Qui est-ce ?
Mon cousin.
Il travaille ŗ la poste.
Je vais tťlťphoner.
Prťpare-toi ŗ Ítre interviewť.
J'ai beaucoup ŗ dire et beaucoup
de temps pour le dire.
Arif, tu peux venir ?
Mon salaud !
Ca va, nťgro ?
Vous avez vu Áa ?
Je viens de parler ŗ Ekdahl.
Walker a donnť 5 interviews
par tťlťphone hier.
Je sais.
Je l'ai entendu ŗ la radio.
Devlin est foutu.
S'il a vraiment achetť du crack.
Tu le crois innocent ?
Jusqu'ŗ preuve du contraire.
ABC, NBC, CNN...
Ils veulent tous des interviews.
Qu'ils parlent ŗ Walker
jusqu'ŗ la dťmission de Devlin.
Devlin
ne laissera pas faire les mťdias.
Au contraire. Je lui ai parlť.
Devlin veut que Walker
parle ŗ la presse.
Putain !
<i>Je ne connais pas Jiggy Walker.</i>
<i>Je n'ai jamais</i>
<i>achetť de drogue ŗ personne.</i>
<i>Il s'agit une fois de plus
d'accusations</i>
<i>d'une presse
assoiffť de scandales.</i>
<i>Je compte aller ŗ Oswald
voir M. Walker.</i>
<i>J'invite la presse
ŗ m'accompagner.</i>
C'est toi qui as appelť
la presse pour Walker.
C'est interdit, McManus ?
Je  dťteste Devlin
autant que toi.
Mais tu aurais dŻ me prťvenir.
J'ai subi deux sťries
d'examens mťdicaux
depuis ma prise de poste.
Cela comprend
un test de toxicomanie
que j'ai moi-mÍme
rendu obligatoire.
Il n'y a aucune trace
de substances chimiques illťgales
dans mon organisme.
Alors, maintenant,
qu'on m'amŤne Jiggy Walker.
Qu'on m'amŤne mon accusateur !
Il y a
d'autres hommes politiques
qui se droguent ?
Qu'est-ce que Áa cache ?
Voilŗ Jiggy.
M. Walker,
vous prťtendez
m'avoir vendu du crack
le 3 mai, dans un appartement
ŗ l'angle de Spring et Vine.
C'est exact.
J'ai des billets d'avion
et une liste d'invitťs
prouvant que le 3 mai
j'ťtais ŗ une rťception
de gouverneurs
ŗ la Maison-Blanche.
Comment aurais-je pu Ítre
ŗ deux endroits
ŗ la fois ?
Ce soir-lŗ, j'ai vendu la came
ŗ un de vos hommes.
Lequel ?
Sam Berlinghoff.
Sam Berlinghoff
ťtait avec moi ŗ Washington.
Comment savoir
que ce type mentait ?
En effet !
Vous prťtendiez que votre cousin
vous appuierait.
James Dyson Walker
a niť sous serment
toute participation
ŗ des transactions de drogue
entre vous et moi.
Vous l'avez payť.
Non, je lui ai demandť
de dire la vťritť.
Et je vous le demande aussi.
Avouez que vous avez menti.
M. Walker, pour une fois,
ayez la dťcence
de le reconnaÓtre.
J'ai menti.
Et alors ?
J'ai menti toute ma vie.
Je reste Jiggy.
Merde !
Je ne te comprends pas.
J'ai passť du temps en prison.
Quand on y entre,
il faut des appuis.
il faut se faire respecter
pour pas qu'on t'emmerde.
Pourquoi
avoir parlť ŗ la presse ?
C'ťtait une idťe ŗ lui,
faire du bruit autour de moi.
Ca valait le coup d'essayer.
Tu savais
que tu serais dťmasquť.
Il y avait des chances.
Alors, pourquoi ?
Mon premier sťjour en prison,
c'ťtait ŗ Lardner.
J'avais 17 ans.
Ma mŤre, ma fiancťe, Latonya,
et mes amis venaient me voir.
Ils sont venus la 1Ťre annťe.
Puis Latonya s'est mariťe.
Elle est plus venue.
Ronnie non plus.
Pareil pour Scat et ma súur.
Mon pŤre est mort.
5 ans aprŤs,
il restait que ma mŤre.
Puis on l'a envoyťe
dans un hospice.
Plus une visite pendant 6 ans.
Personne pour vťrifier
si je respirais.
Je me suis dit :
"Si tu deviens une star,
"on viendra te voir,
on t'oubliera pas."
ņ bas le pouvoir !
Il est furax.
Tu quittes Em City.
Il paraÓt.
Oui, je sais que c'est choquant.
Merci, M. le Prťsident.
Au bout du compte,
c'ťtait une bonne journťe.
Vous n'avez pas montť tout Áa,
dites ?
Vous n'avez pas payť Walker
pour mentir ?
Non, j'ai seulement
tirť profit de la situation.
On m'a tellement accusť
que lorsque j'ai vu
que je pouvais me blanchir
sur ce coup...
«a donne
ŗ toutes les autres accusations
une petite pointe de doute.
Rendez-moi service.
Donnez Áa ŗ Walker.
Il le mťrite !
Giles ťtait sur les lieux
quand mon mari a ťtť tuť.
Il a vu qui a poussť Leonard
du camion.
Mais il refuse de le dire.
"Aim".
Il rťpŤte Áa sans arrÍt : "Aim".
Que comptez-vous faire ?
Parler ŗ Augustus Hill.
Avant l'ouverture d'Em City,
il ťtait dans l'unitť de Giles.
Avant d'Ítre envoyť au trou,
Giles parlait-il
de sa vie ŗ l'extťrieur ?
Je suppose.
Comment Áa ?
J'ťcoutais pas ce qu'il disait.
Il arrÍtait pas de radoter.
J'ai coupť le son.
Et le jour
oý il a tuť Ron Beebe ?
C'ťtait un jour
comme les autres.
Ron Beebe a ťtť tuť
pour avoir tentť
de voler
les affaires de Giles.
Le rapport dit le contraire.
Je connais rien
aux rapports, mais Giles
ťtait scrupuleux pour ses dents.
Il se les brossait sans arrÍt.
Son dentifrice ťtait
son bien le plus prťcieux.
Son dentifrice...
Augustus,
quelle marque utilisait-il ?
La mÍme que moi : Aim.
Ron Beebe a tuť mon mari.
Vous pouvez m'en parler ?
Gingivite, mauvais.
Beebe, pire.
Moi... úil... Beebe.
Beebe... úil... moi.
Il a vu
que vous l'aviez vu pousser
Leonard du camion ?
Vous savez pourquoi
Beebe a tuť mon mari ?
Dťsolť.
Il ne vous a jamais dit
pourquoi il l'avait poussť ?
Dťsolť !
Ce n'est rien.
Giles a tuť
l'assassin de votre mari
et vous voudriez
que je le sorte du mitard.
Et s'il vous faisait marcher ?
S'il avait tout inventť ?
Je le crois, Leo.
MÍme s'il a fait ce qu'il dit,
il est enclin ŗ la violence.
C'est une menace
pour les autres.
Je pense que je devrais faire
quelque chose pour lui.
De la part de súur Peter Marie.
Dr Prestopnik, Áa va ?
J'ai mal au dos,
j'ai des problŤmes de plomberie
et ma femme veut fÍter
nos 30 ans de mariage
dans les Iles Vierges.
Vous parlez de nostalgie !
ņ part Áa, tout roule !
Et vous ?
J'ai vu ŗ la tťlť
que le hasch attťnuait
les effets de la chimio.
Qu'est-ce que vous en dites ?
Vous en voudriez ?
Oui, dans un but thťrapeutique.
Bien tentť, mon petit.
Vous rťagissez bien,
vos cheveux repoussent,
c'est sŻrement
votre derniŤre sťance.
Putain, Dieu merci !
Comment va le Dr Nathan ?
Je suis au courant,
pour le meurtre de son mari.
On l'enterre jeudi.
Elle revient demain.
Quelle femme !
Transmettez-lui mes condolťances.
Ce sera fait.
Dr Prestopnik, ma femme,
Shannon.
Enchantť et plus encore.
Tu viens pas souvent.
Je sais, je suis occupťe.
ņ quoi ?
ņ surveiller ton frŤre.
Il perd les pťdales.
J'ai appelť mon cousin,
il va s'en occuper.
Toi et moi,
c'est fini.
Quoi ?
Je veux plus Ítre ton mari.
Pourquoi ?
J'ai quelqu'un d'autre.
Gloria,
qu'est-ce que tu fais lŗ ?
Tout ce qu'il me reste,
c'est le boulot, maintenant.
Prends des vacances.
Oý Áa ?
Oý aller pour oublier tout Áa ?
C'ťtait pas idťal,
entre Preston et moi.
Trop de mensonges,
de mises ŗ l'ťpreuve...
trop de fiertť...
Mais on s'aimait.
Vraiment.
C'ťtait un homme bien.
Pourquoi
fallait-il qu'il meure ?

- De la gnŰle.

Il y a un problŤme.
Je ne bois plus depuis un an.
Et alors ?
Je suis alcoolique.
Tous mes problŤmes

Maintenant que je suis dťbarrassť

- Te f‚che pas.
- Je suis pas f‚chť.
Tu es f‚chť.
C'ťtait une idťe stupide.
Le problŤme,
c'est que je rťflťchis pas assez.
Ne te rabaisse pas.
C'est mignon.
D'oý tu sors ce truc ?
Un ami a fabriquť un alambic.
Il a pas bu ?
Putain !
Il en ťtait pas loin.

Toute la beautť de notre projet,
c'est de dťterrer

Je le ferai boire.

Quatre, en comptant...
Bonnie que j'ai ťpousťe deux fois.
Pourquoi tous ces mariages ?
Je suis vieux jeu.
Avant de baiser, j'ťpouse.
Le problŤme...
c'est le cul.
C'est jamais comme au dťbut
et quand c'est nul au lit,
je m'aperÁois
qu'on a rien en commun.

LA FERME DES ANIMAUX
Saison 2, Episode 7
On appelle ça l'effet papillon.
Un papillon bat des ailes en Chine.
Avec le temps,
ce mouvement d'air
va devenir un ouragan au Texas.
Un jour, un papillon
danse sur une fleur,
le lendemain,
il y a des pianos dans les arbres.
Ce papillon n'en sait rien.
<i>Il cherche juste de la nourriture,
de l'amour, une quelconque</i>
<i>satisfaction.</i>
A l'appel !
Et merde !
Allez, Beecher !
Je me sens pas bien.
Ça empeste l'alcool.
Tu as bu ?
Non.
Si, tu as bu.
Suis-moi.
Oů t'as eu ça ?
Je sais pas.
C'est apparu comme par magie ?
Une fée l'a amené ?
Ou bien Keller ?
Si c'est lui, il restera au trou.
Non, c'est moi.
Qui t'a vendu cet alcool ?
- Un mec de l'unité B.
- Son nom ?
J'en sais rien.
Tu veux aller au trou ?
J'aimerais lui parler seule.
Il est ŕ vous.
Je sais, ma sśur.
Je me conduisais si bien.
Vous ętes sous pression
ces temps-ci.
Votre femme est morte,
vous ętes tombé amoureux...
Vous me l'avez dit.
C'est Keller ?
Il est au trou
et il vous manque ?
Vous irez ŕ l'hôpital
prendre une aspirine
et cuver votre alcool.
Juste pour cette fois.
Si vous rebuvez,
je vous botte le cul.
Le courrier !
Salut, Beecher.
Paraît que t'as pris une cuite.
T'es bouleversé
par le suicide de ta femme ?
Ça te réconforterait
si je te disais
que je l'ai faite tuer ?
Tu mens.
Peut-ętre bien que oui,
peut-ętre bien que non.
Elle m'a écrit un mot
m'expliquant ses raisons.
Elle aurait tout écrit,
tout fait,
avec ce revolver pointé sur elle.
Foutaises.
Tu n'en seras jamais sűr.
Quoi qu'il en soit,
c'est de ta faute.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Rien.
A plus tard, ducon.
Je peux avoir de l'eau ?
O'Reilly...
Ton frčre est arrivé ŕ Oz hier.
Tu l'as vu ?
Tu sais oů il est ?
Je peux me renseigner.
Pourquoi cet intéręt soudain
pour ma famille ?
Deux frčres dans la męme prison...
Tu veux nous convertir ?
Nous faire un prix de gros ?
Va te faire foutre !
Dégage !
T'es Cyril O'Reilly ?
Je peux avoir ma balle ?
Tu ressembles ŕ ton frčre.
Je peux avoir ma balle ?
J'ai connu Ryan ŕ Emerald City.
Emerald City ? C'est quoi ?
Tu veux voir Em City ?
Tu veux voir ton frčre ?
Suis-moi.
Oů est Ryan ?
Cyril, ŕ Oz,
les choses marchent comme ça :
avant que je t'emmčne le voir,
tu dois faire un truc pour moi.
OK. Quoi ?
Pour commencer, déshabille-toi.
On dit que les chats
voient dans le noir.
Mais comment en ętre sűr ?
Si on avait les yeux d'un chat,
ne serait-ce qu'une nuit,
voudrait-on pour autant
voir ce qui se passe ?
Cyril...
Arręte !
C'est mon frčre.
On dirait plutôt ta sśur.
Arręte !
Ils t'ont mis oů ?
Dans quelle unité ?
Je sais pas. Avec lui.
Je lui ai fait un accueil royal.
T'as pas intéręt ŕ le toucher,
espčce d'enculé !
N'approche plus de ce sale nazi.
Tu m'as compris, Cyril ?
Je crois que j'ai fait une bętise.
Merde !
Ecoute-moi.
Je vais te faire transférer.
J'ignore combien de temps
ça prendra. Alors, en attendant,
frappe-moi.
Frappe.
Je te dis de me frapper !
Arręte.
Direction le trou !
Suis-le !
T'es mort.
Je veux que tu transfčres
mon frčre ŕ Em City.
Ton frčre... Celui qui a tué
le mari de Gloria Nathan ?
Celui qu'on a mis au trou
pour t'avoir frappé ?
Me fais pas rire.
Si tu laisses Cyril oů il est,
Schillinger le saignera ŕ blanc.
Qu'il s'en prenne ŕ ton frčre
ou ŕ un autre...
Il est attardé.
Il a eu un accident l'an passé.
Depuis, il est attardé.
Il ne comprend pas tout.
Il ne peut pas se protéger.
C'est triste, mais tant pis.
Je ferai tout ce que tu voudras.
Tout.
- Un marché ?
- Oui.
OK. Dénonce quelqu'un.
- Qui ?
- Toi-męme.
Avoue que tu lui as demandé
de tuer Preston Nathan.
C'est faux.
A d'autres !
Si j'accepte,
je risque dix piges de plus.
Pas question.
Alors ton frčre restera
dans les bras aimants
de Schillinger.
Joue pas ŕ ça !
Si t'as un truc ŕ dire, dis-le.
J'ai ŕ faire.
Va te faire foutre, McManus !
<i>Une loi oblige désormais
les délinquants sexuels</i>
<i>sortant de prison
ŕ s'inscrire au commissariat.</i>
<i>Les associations de victimes
s'en félicitent.</i>
<i>Les voisins seront avisés
si l'un d'eux emménage.</i>
C'est orwellien !
Orwe-quoi ?
Si un homme paie sa dette
ŕ la société,
il a droit ŕ une vie normale.
Ils sont pas normaux. Si j'en ai un
pour voisin, je préfčre le savoir.
Toi ?
Tu as commis un meurtre.
Et alors ?
S'ils étendaient la loi
aux assassins,
si tu devais le dire
ŕ tous les voisins ?
Pourquoi pas
les bigots, les občses,
les gens qui parlent au ciné ?
Je les déteste.
Ils devraient plutôt
nous prévenir quand une nympho
aux gros nichons emménage
dans notre quartier.
Ça, ce serait bien.
Et nous filer ses coordonnées !
Passionnant !
Vous n'ętes que des obsédés.
Vous ramenez tout ŕ ça :
aux nichons et ŕ la baise.
Délinquant sexuel !
Sippel, suis-moi.
<i>Je suis prętre.</i>
<i>Je suis un pervers.</i>
<i>J'ai su trčs tôt
que j'avais la vocation.</i>
Et que j'avais cet autre...
cet autre penchant.
J'ai suivi le premier,
mais jamais le second.
J'ai passé ma vie
ŕ faire le bien.
Et malgré ça...
je n'ai jamais vu Dieu...
jusqu'ŕ ce que je rencontre
ce garçon.
Il avait 14 ans.
Son corps était si parfait,
si pur, si angélique.
Il fallait que je le touche.
Prisonnier matricule 88S510,
Robert Sippel,
condamné le 10 mars 1988
pour délit sexuel contre un mineur.
Peine : 15 ans.
Libérable sur parole
au bout de 10 ans.
Je l'ai caressé un instant.
Rien qu'un instant.
Il n'a ni crié ni pleuré.
Il n'a rien dit ŕ personne.
J'ai avoué.
Je veux ętre sauvé.
Je veux faire le bien.
Je veux que Jésus me pardonne.
Il vous a pardonné.
Mais vous devez
vous pardonner aussi.
Vous avez purgé votre peine.
Demain, vous pourrez
commencer une nouvelle vie.
Une nouvelle vie ?
Quelle vie puis-je bien avoir ?
Sippel sort demain,
sans travail,
sans endroit oů vivre,
sans aucune aide.
J'ai prié un ami du diocčse
de lui trouver un lit,
il m'a ri au nez.
Normal.
L'Eglise a versé
un million ŕ sa victime.
Demandez au cardinal de l'aider.
Non.
Pourquoi ?
Je me vois mal lui demander ça.
Parce que...
Nos rapports
sont orageux au possible.
Je ne peux pas
le solliciter sans arręt.
Et ?
Et Sippel me dégoűte.
Il a fait une erreur.
Il s'est repenti.
Il mérite l'absolution.
Il a volé l'innocence d'un enfant.
- C'est un pédophile.
- C'était.
Cet enfant lui faisait confiance.
C'est une menace.
Pour qui ? La société ?
Le clergé ?
Pour vous ?
Bonjour, Pčre Mukada.
Vous lisez le bréviaire ?
Tous les jours,
comme je le faisais au séminaire.
Mais vous n'ętes plus prętre.
En recevant l'ordination,
j'ai été nommé prętre ŕ vie.
Tout comme vous.
Mais l'Eglise m'interdit d'exercer.
Je suis prętre ŕ vie,
mais on m'interdit d'ętre prętre.
Je suis homme ŕ vie,
mais on m'interdit d'ętre homme.
Je suis...
et pourtant, je ne suis pas.
Priez avec moi.
Je ne peux pas.
Je ne peux pas prier avec vous.
Mais je prierai pour vous.
<i>Il s'agit juste</i>
de lui donner une seconde chance.
Il ne peut s'occuper d'enfants,
mais l'Eglise est toute sa vie...
Si vous l'abandonnez...
Bien sűr, la victime...
Oui.
Non.
Merci, Monseigneur.
<i>Nous apprenons</i>
<i>que Robert Sippel,</i>
<i>un prętre condamné</i>
<i>pour pédophilie sort aujourd'hui</i>
<i>du pénitencier d'Oswald.
Sippel a passé dix ans</i>
<i>en prison pour sévices sexuels
sur un garçon de 14 ans.</i>
<i>Il devra se faire enregistrer
au commissariat.</i>
<i>Il résidera sans doute
dans la région.</i>
<i>La population s'inquičte</i>
<i>de la venue de ce nouveau voisin.</i>
Ceci est la coupe de mon sang,
le sang de l'Alliance
nouvelle et éternelle.
Il sera versé pour vous
en rémission de vos péchés.
Faites cela en mémoire de moi.
Schillinger !
Combien pour m'expédier
par la poste ?
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Je veux me tirer d'ici.
T'évader d'Oz ?
Tu pourrais m'empaqueter
et m'envoyer ŕ ma femme
en courrier express prioritaire.
Combien ça ferait tout compris ?
T'es sérieux ?
Alors, t'es fou.
C'est non ?
Oui... Non.
Non... Oui, c'est non.
Dégage de lŕ !
Je t'en veux pas. T'y peux rien
si t'es moche et con.
Ben ça alors !
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Il est amoureux.
Adebisi ? Ça me ferait mal !
De qui ?
Shirley Bellinger.
Sans blague ?
La garce condamnée ŕ mort ?
Je t'assure.
Ils échangent des mots chaque midi
depuis une semaine.
Comment il la connaît ?
C'est ça qui est drôle.
Ils se sont jamais vus.
Tire-toi, t'as des maladies.
Je suis guéri.
Le cancer n'est pas contagieux.
Qu'on dit !
- Je veux revenir en cuisine.
- Non.
Je t'ai pas toujours aidé ?
Je suis ton seul ami.
Tu sais lire, hein ?
Oui, et toi aussi.
Pas les mots comme ça.
Y a écrit quoi ?
"Sculptural".
- Ça veut dire quoi ?
- Trčs musclé.
Je suis sculptural.
Entre autres. Montre.
Fais voir.
Demain, c'est son anniversaire.
Son dernier anniversaire sur Terre.
Et la seule chose
qu'elle désire vraiment,
c'est voir
ton corps sculptural nu...
et te sucer la bite.
C'est écrit oů ?
Juste lŕ.
"Fellation"...
"Cunnilingus"...
Elle a du vocabulaire.
Je veux la voir.
Je veux la rencontrer.
Tu veux qu'elle te suce ?
Si j'arrange ça,
tu me reprends en cuisine ?
Si elle me taille une pipe...
je t'en taillerai une.
Quelle idée alléchante !
Sans moi.
Tu peux faire ça ?
Pas de problčme.
Demain, Adebisi ira nettoyer
ŕ ta place.
Pour voir Bellinger.
Non. Elle me montre sa chatte.
Pour une fois, tu t'en passeras.
Prends ça.
Tiens, Shirley.
Merci, bouboule.
Ça alors !
Ce Simon pense vraiment ŕ tout.
Ton gâteau te plaît ?
Oui.
Joyeux anniversaire.
Tu es Simon ?
Vite.
- Avant l'arrivée des matons.
- Mais...
Tu es noir.
Suce-moi tout de suite.
Suce-moi.
Suce-moi !
Wangler !
Vise-moi ça.
Ce nčgre est cinglé.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
Tire-toi.
T'as disjoncté ?
Tire-toi !
<i>Reste tranquille !</i>
Comment va ta tęte ?
T'as le cerveau niqué ?
Laissez tomber.
Ignorez-les.
J'ai une bonne nouvelle.
Antonio Nappa vient ŕ Oz.
Sachez qu'ŕ Emerald City,
on a des rčgles.
Bien plus
que n'importe oů ŕ Oz.
Votre cellule est votre maison.
Gardez-la propre.
Vous devrez faire de l'exercice,
assister aux cours,
aux programmes de désintoxication,
obéir aux rčgles.
Il est interdit de crier,
de se battre, de baiser.
Ceux qui vont ŕ Em City
auront chacun un parrain.
Voici la liste : Nappa
avec Pancamo...
Hoyt avec Burns...
Vincent
avec Adebisi.
Les autres,
suivez l'officier Tobin.
<i>Un poisson rouge</i>
<i>vit une vie entičre
toutes les 30 secondes.</i>
Chaque demi-minute,
son cerveau oublie tout
ce qui s'est passé avant.
Autrement dit,
quand ce poisson est heureux,
il croit l'avoir toujours été
car sa vie se résume
aux 30 derničres secondes.
Quand il a faim,
il croit avoir toujours eu faim.
<i>Et quand il meurt,</i>
<i>il croit qu'il a passé
toute sa vie ŕ mourir.</i>
Vous imaginez ?
La mort est la seule vie
que ce petit poisson rouge
connaîtra jamais.
Prisonnier matricule 98N744,
Antonio Nappa.
Condamné le 4 juin 1998
pour homicide.
Peine : 80 ans.
Libérable sur parole dans 50 ans.
J'ai été trčs attristé
par le viol de Peter Scibetta.
Son pčre et moi étions amis.
Je suis le parrain de Peter.
Son vrai parrain, au baptęme.
On ne tolérera aucune vengeance.
Vous avez raison.
Tout ce que je vous demande,
c'est de punir le coupable.
Une fois trouvé.
Vous n'avez aucun suspect ?
Nous avons des suspects,
mais pas de témoins.
Pancamo était inconscient
et Scibetta...
Refuse de parler ?
Exact.
Puis-je le voir ?
Non.
Antonio, je crois
que Peter a perdu la boule.
Il parle ŕ son pčre,
comme s'il vivait encore.
Cet Adebisi qui a violé Peter...
on ne peut pas le tuer maintenant.
Mais je veux qu'il souffre.
Je veux lui enlever
ce qui lui est le plus cher.
C'est l'héroďne. Il est toxico.
Il en consomme et en vend ?
Alors, j'aurai ce négro.
Je veux que tu suggčres ŕ Glynn
de faire quelques contrôles
antidrogue au hasard.
Entendu.
Toi... toi...
toi...
et toi, suivez-moi.
Hill...
Rebadow...
Saďd...
Adebisi...
Aprčs l'émeute,
vous avez traversé
une période de manque.
Vous n'avez pas décroché ?
Si.
A d'autres ! Ces rapports
disent le contraire.
Vous devez suivre une thérapie.
Désolé, mais c'est de la connerie.
Alors, vous serez contrôlé
chaque semaine.
Et si vous continuez,
je vous envoie en psychiatrie.
Vous y ętes déjŕ allé, Simon ?
Peter Scibetta y est,
avec 20 types qui on perdu
le sens de la réalité.
La réalité ? A Oz ?
Dans quel monde vivez-vous ?
Ou plutôt,
quel monde essayez-vous de fuir ?
Parce que la drogue
est une fuite, Simon.
C'est l'incapacité d'accepter
un secret enfoui en soi.
Ma sśur, m'envoyez pas
chez les dingues.
Je viendrai ŕ vos réunions.
Je ne me droguerai plus.
Tu veux ma photo, papi ?
Nappa a manigancé ces contrôles
pour te mettre sur la touche.
Je vais devoir tuer quelques Ritals.
Bien parlé.
On va choper Nappa et ses potes
et leur couper la gorge.
- Maintenant ?
- Ouais.
En plein déjeuner ?
T'es dingue !
- Tu vois un meilleur moment ?
- Et comment !
Tous les matons vont nous voir.
Qu'ils nous voient.
Retourne en cuisine.
Tu nous déshonores tous
en agissant ainsi.
Dégage.
On est des frčres africains.
Y a des Noirs partout.
Toi et moi, on est différents.
Je suis pas différent.
Yoruba !
Qu'ont-ils fait de toi ?
Qui es-tu ?
Et toi ?
Un problčme,
Adebisi ?
Aucun, officier.
Alors, au boulot.
Que te voulait ce vieux ?
C'est qu'un pauvre cinglé.
Tu devais t'occuper de Nappa.
Un autre jour.
T'as un plan en tęte ?
Ouais, m'allonger un peu.
Oů est le walkman ?
Les piles sont faibles.
Tiens.
Y a quoi dedans ?
Une merde envoyée par mon cousin.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait pour Nappa ?
Va te faire foutre.
Si ta bite finit dans un cannelloni,
faudra pas m'emmerder.
Tu crois
au vaudou,
au pouvoir de la magie ?
Moi, si.
Une vieille légende sicilienne
veut qu'une jeune mariée attende
ses rčgles et verse son sang
dans la premičre sauce tomate
qu'elle fait ŕ son mari.
Pourquoi ?
S'il boit son sang,
elle le contrôlera ŕ jamais.
Quelqu'un a jeté un sort ŕ Adebisi.
Dommage que ce ne soit pas nous.
Les documentaires animaliers
sont trčs populaires ŕ Oz.
Toutes ces bętes qui s'attaquent,
ces lions courant au point d'eau,
brutalisant antilopes et gazelles.
Pourquoi ne voit-on jamais
d'animaux s'entendre,
s'entraider ?
Un ornithorynque ne pourrait-il aider
un cacatočs ŕ traverser la rue ?
Et maintenant ?
La partie marrante.
On lit toutes les lettres.
La dirlo a une rčgle :
chaque lettre arrivant ŕ Oz
doit ętre examinée soigneusement.
Au cas oů il y aurait du louche.
On est censés remettre
les lettres suspectes au maton.
Et on le fait ?
Il y a souvent des contrôles.
Il faut bien choisir son moment.
On connaît les histoires de chacun.
Exact.
Et comme ce grand homme disait :
"Savoir, c'est pouvoir."
On peut faire des dégâts avec ça.
Détends-toi. Tu souffres du SL.
SL ?
Le syndrome du lapin.
C'est fréquent dans ce boulot.
On creuse sans arręt
et juste avant de plonger
dans le terrier, on panique.
Ça existe vraiment, ce syndrome ?
Oui.
J'ai inventé le nom,
mais ça existe.
- Qu'est-ce que t'attends ?
- Du calme.
Quoi ?
Ça vient de ma mčre.
T'as une mčre ?
Elle a 90 ans.
Mon petit-fils a une leucémie.
T'as un petit-fils ?
Ma fiancée était enceinte
quand on m'a arręté.
T'as fait des cochonneries !
T'as un gosse.
Un garçon ou une fille ?
Un garçon... un homme.
Alex doit avoir 34 ans
et il a un fils.
Qui a une leucémie.
Je ne les ai jamais vus.
OK. Autre chose ?
Oui. Ce type, Rebadow...
Son petit-fils a une leucémie.
C'est moche.
Avant de mourir,
il veut aller ŕ Disneyworld.
- Moi aussi.
- Mickey taille des pipes.
Qui te l'a dit ?
Je bosse au courrier.
J'ai lu la lettre de sa mčre.
Sa famille n'a pas les 3000 $
pour l'envoyer ŕ Disneyworld.
On pourrait l'envoyer, nous.
- Nous ?
- Comment ?
Mon club de moto
avait récolté 10 000 $
en courant
pour la fondation McDonald.
Vous gagnez tous de l'argent ici,
comme moi.
Au lieu d'acheter des conneries,
faisons un don.
On s'en fout,
de son petit-fils.
Si tu t'en fous, OK.
Sinon, aide-nous.
Les gardiens verseront
la męme somme que vous.
La séance est levée.
C'est pas grand-chose,
mais prends-le.
Merci, Augustus,
Tobias, Busmalis.
T'as combien ?
Avec ça et l'argent sur mon compte...
72 dollars.
172.
De la part des frčres.
Je me croyais condamné.
Peut-ętre qu'il s'en sortira aussi.
Peut-ętre.
Mais au cas oů...
J'ai aussi des gosses.
Des emmerdeurs, mais...
Combien tu as ?
Presque 2000 dollars.
Avec ça, tu auras largement assez.
Demain matin,
j'enverrai l'argent ŕ ma mčre.
Je lui ai dit qu'il allait arriver
et que ce don devait ętre anonyme.
Mon petit-fils ne doit pas savoir.
Tu as honte ?
Oui.
Il paraît que Rebadow
a récolté 3000 dollars.
Il enverra le pognon demain.
Tu sais quoi ?
J'ai un plan :
on va voir Rebadow,
on prend le fric
et pour pas avoir d'emmerdes,
on lui fait jurer qu'il l'a envoyé.
Comment ça ? Y a 3000 $.
J'ai dit non.
Pourquoi ?
Parfois, ça fait du bien
d'ętre humain.

Alvarez !
J'ai une question ŕ te poser.
Tu bosses ŕ l'hosto.
Tu vois pas un moyen
de se tirer ?
Se tirer ? Tu parles d'évasion ?
Ouais, mec.
Tu veux t'évader ?
J'étudie les possibilités.
L'hôpital est en cul-de-sac.
S'il y avait une issue,
je ne serais plus lŕ.
Mais si jamais t'as un plan,
préviens-moi.
Je serai lŕ
pour te pousser.
Bienvenue au pénitencier d'Oswald.
Nous sommes ravis
que le budget ait privilégié
l'embauche de surveillants.
Votre présence
réduira les tensions
entre gardiens et détenus
et accroîtra la sécurité de tous.
Je me tenais lŕ oů vous ętes,
il y a 30 ans.
Le directeur
nous avait donné ce conseil
que je vous répčte :
soyez réceptifs et attentifs.
J'ajouterai quant ŕ moi :
soyez objectifs.
Encore une fois, bienvenue.
Je connais ce type.
- Le maton ?
- Il était du gang des Diablos.
Vous leur avez réglé leur compte.
Rivera
est une lavette.
A propos
de lavettes...
Ecrase !
<i>Que veux-tu, Michael ?</i>
M'asseoir.
Seul avec lui.
Laisse-nous. T'as perdu.
Mon grand-pčre a passé
40 ans ŕ Oz,
dont la moitié au mitard.
Je sais.
Mon pčre est détenu ici.
On lui a arraché la langue.
Je sais. Et alors ?
J'ai eu mon lot d'emmerdes ici.
Ça m'est égal
que tu me remplaces.
Toi, El Cid, t'as des couilles.
Mais depuis ton arrivée, j'en bave.
On m'humilie chaque jour.
Dis-moi ce que je dois faire
pour entrer dans tes bonnes grâces.
Change de peau.
T'es trop blanc.
Je peux rien y faire.
Je parle pas de ton physique,
mais de ça.
Trop blanc.
C'est faux.
Je te le prouverai.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Tu vois le maton lŕ-bas ?
Tu plaisantes ?
Papa...
Il a encore chié dans son lit ?
Je vais t'aider.
J'ai un problčme. T'es le seul
ŕ qui je peux en parler.
El Cid est ŕ Oz.
Il me laissera rester dans la partie...
que si j'arrache
les yeux d'un maton.
Un nouveau, Rivera.
A mon avis,
si je le fais, je suis mort.
Les matons auront ma peau.
Sinon, ce sera El Cid.
Je suis perdu.
Que dois-je faire ?
A l'appel !

Quoi, Alvarez ?
On dit que les yeux
sont le miroir de l'âme.
De quoi tu parles ?
Content de te voir.
<i>Diane Wittlesey
a-t-elle tiré sur Ross</i>
<i>dans le but de le tuer ?</i>
<i>Wittlesey a-t-elle assassiné Ross ?</i>
<i>Non.</i>
Tu as le temps de vérifier
les rapports statistiques ?
Non. J'ai promis ŕ Coushaine
d'assister ŕ son cours.
Leo...
Dis-moi...
comment va ta fille ?
Elle est sortie de l'hôpital.
Elle se rétablit.
Je suis content pour toi.
Et ton frčre ?
Son procčs débute dans 15 jours.
Dieu donne, Dieu reprend.
On se fait un petit un contre un ?
Non.
Je ne peux dire la vérité
sur la mort de Ross,
mais j'en ai assez
de mentir.
J'ai essayé. Je n'y arrive pas.
Arrange-toi
pour ne plus avoir ŕ le faire.
Pardon.
Tu m'as déjŕ vue nue.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Tu dis que je garde trop
les choses pour moi,
que je dois ętre plus franc.
Je vais l'ętre.
A l'audience,
j'ai posé ma main sur la Bible
et j'ai juré devant Dieu
de dire la vérité.
Et puis, j'ai menti.
J'ai menti pour toi.
Depuis, ŕ chaque fois
que je te vois,
ça me rappelle mon mensonge,
ce serment devant Dieu
que j'ai rompu,
mon péché.
Et ?
Je veux que tu changes d'unité.
Wittlesey bosse ŕ l'unité B.
Découvre pourquoi.
- Elle a vendu des clopes ?
- Elle est dépressive.
A cause de McManus.
- Ses nichons me manquent.
- A moi aussi.
- Ton avis ?
- Je l'ai jamais aimée.
Je me demande qui va la remplacer.
Du moment que c'est pas lui...
Les gens se demandent toujours
si leurs animaux iront au ciel.
Si Jojo ou Muffy passeront
les portes du paradis.
Je parie qu'eux se demandent
si leurs maîtres y arriveront.
Les chiens, les chats, les oiseaux
ne passent pas leur vie
dans le péché, le mensonge
et la souffrance,
mais dans la vérité.
Vous imaginez ?
Si tout ce qu'on vivait sur Terre
était la vérité...
Beecher...
Ne fais pas ça.
Quoi ?
Ne bois pas.
T'aimes te męler de nos vies.
Parce que tu as vu la lumičre,
tu as vu la face de Dieu.
Alors, tu te démčnes pour sauver
les pauvres mortels qu'on est.
Hill, Mershah, Groves,
Jefferson Keane.
Tu l'as si bien aidé
qu'il a été exécuté.
Mais finalement...
si on fait le bilan,
qui as-tu vraiment aidé,
ŕ part toi-męme ?
Le Počte.
Le Počte ?
J'ai vu aux infos
qu'il a tué un homme.
Il revient ŕ Oz.
"La petite Miss Mange-Trop

On peut passer, mon frčre ?
Amčne-toi.
<i>Qu'est-ce qui sépare</i>
<i>l'homme du poisson rouge,</i>
<i>du papillon
ou de l'ornithorynque ?</i>
Son esprit ?
Son âme ?
Le fait qu'il ait la télé ?
Peut-ętre est-ce le fait
qu'il soit la seule espčce
ŕ mettre d'autres animaux en cage,
ŕ mettre ses semblables en cage.

S'EVADER D'OZ
Saison 2, Episode 8
S'évader...
Quel mot !
Quel concept !
D'après le dictionnaire,
s'évader, c'est s'échapper,
reprendre sa liberté.
Il y a plein de moyens
de se tirer d'Oz.
<i>On peut s'évader en creusant.</i>
Vite, je remets les carreaux.
Ecoutez-moi tous.
L'agent Wittlesey
est mutée dans l'unité B.
Son remplaçant à Em City
est Karl Metzger.
Certains me connaissent déjà.
On me dit sévère, mais juste.
Je me laisserai pas emmerder,
mais j'emmerderai personne.
C'est tout.
C'est sûrement par là.
Que se passe-t-il ?
C'est où ?
- Quoi ?
- Te fous pas de moi.
Où est le tunnel ?
Quel tunnel ?
On t'a vu.
Laisse-le. Le voilà.
Putain !
Jusqu'où ça va ?
Demain,
on devrait franchir l'enceinte.
On partira avec vous.
Comment ? On partira la nuit,
vous serez enfermés.
On échangera nos cellules.
On échange nos cellules
ou on dit tout aux matons.
Si l'échange est possible,
le tunnel est à vous.
Tais-toi, Busmalis.
Oui, ta gueule.
Je veux pas
que ces nazis violent Lizzie.
A Oz, j'ai appris une chose :
accepter la donne.
Quitte à perdre le tunnel,
autant recommencer
dans la cellule d'à côté.
Putain !
Metzger ?
J'ai une requête.
Je veux changer
Rebadow et Busmalis de cellule.
D'accord.
Tu demandes pas pourquoi ?
Je te fais confiance.
Prenez soin d'elle.
Je t'emmerde !
Et voilà !
Comment tu peux rester calme ?
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Allons-y !
Ils doivent y être.
On aurait dû leur dire.
Leur dire qu'on avait
affaibli le soutènement.
On aurait dû les prévenir
que le tunnel s'effondrerait.
Putain, regarde-moi ça !
Je crois pouvoir y arriver.
Merde !
Ça va ?
<i>Sale juif !</i>
<i>Ça va pas ?</i>
<i>Détenu matricule 96N542,
Mark Mack.</i>
<i>Condamné le 1er juin 96</i>
<i>pour homicide,</i>
<i>vandalisme, délits raciaux.</i>
<i>Peine : 70 ans.
Conditionnelle</i>
<i>au bout de 40 ans.</i>
Recule, vieux !
Ça tombe !
Ça s'effondre !
Putain, recule !
Je suis là depuis 5 minutes
et il y a déjà deux morts !
Ça va pas se passer comme ça !
Le prochain trou, qui y va ?
Je mettrai l'un de vous
dans le 1er trou
qu'on trouve.
Qui veut une pelle ?
Creusez-moi un putain de trou !
Allez !
Nom de Dieu !
Le tunnel était
dans votre ancienne cellule.
Oui, c'est lui qui l'a creusé.
Sous les ordres de Mark Mack.
Mack t'a forcé à creuser ?
Il menaçait de tuer Busmalis.
Pas vrai ?
Oui,
le sale nazi !
Si c'est vrai,
il fallait nous en parler.
C'est facile à dire.
Le pauvre était terrorisé.
Terrorisé.
Il les a prévenus
du danger,
mais ils voulaient partir.
Ils ont pas écouté.
Il faudrait quand même les punir.
Ils sont plutôt disciplinés.
Vous pouvez y aller.
Ça va, le Poète ?
C'est mon nouveau poste :
la morgue.
La vengeance de McManus
parce que j'ai merdé dehors.
Pourquoi ? Tu étais libre.
Mais toujours accro.
J'ai dépensé tout l'argent
du bouquin en crack.
Quand j'ai manqué de fric,
les dealers ont rappliqué.
Je me suis défendu.
Tu as tiré 6 fois sur un mec.
Pour être sûr de le buter.
On fait quoi ici ?
On attend l'entrepreneur
des pompes funèbres.
Des élèves viennent
s'entraîner sur nos cadavres.
Et on les aide ?
Ouais, on leur passe
le natron, les cosmétiques...
Du rouge à lèvres,
des trucs comme ça ?
Faut être beau
quand on te plante.
Je suis pas une gonzesse.
On me mettra pas ça
sur la tronche.
Quand t'es mort,
t'as pas le choix.
La mort,
ça ressemble à la vie à Oz.
Ça marchera, je te dis.
De quoi vous parlez ?
Ecoute un peu ! Il a une idée
pour s'évader d'Oz.
C'est quoi ?
On travaille
à la morgue, d'accord ?
On a mis deux connards d'aryens
en bière
pour qu'ils soient enterrés.
Mon idée,
c'est de prendre la place
du prochain mort.
Les cercueils sont hermétiques.
Tu t'asphyxieras.
Merci.
Pas si je perce quelques trous.
Mais le cercueil sera fermé.
Pas si quelques amis
viennent me libérer.
Tu feras quoi des vrais morts ?
C'est facile de cacher
des cadavres ici !
En tous cas, temporairement !
Bonne idée !
Exactement.
C'est mieux
que de partir avec le courrier.
Chaque détenu veut sortir
de prison, coûte que coûte.
Mais certains, une fois libres,
sont déroutés
par la vie au dehors.
Je viens voir sœur Peter Marie.
Robert Sippel vous demande.
Mon père,
les garçons sont mignons dehors ?
Il y en a qui s'appellent Nick ?
Vous semblez épuisé.
Ces derniers jours
ont été difficiles.
C'est dur, de se présenter
comme délinquant sexuel.
Au palais de justice,
j'étais
avec des gens ordinaires...
qui voulaient
un permis de pêche.
J'ai dit doucement à l'employée
pourquoi j'étais là.
Elle a hurlé :
"Les pervers doivent remplir ça."
Mon Dieu !
Comment se passe
votre recherche d'emploi ?
"Cherche et tu trouveras" !
C'est dur
pour un ex-détenu,
mais quand on apprend qu'en plus
j'ai abusé d'un garçon...
Vous avez trouvé un logement ?
Après 10 ans de prison,
j'ai passé mes premières nuits
de liberté dans le métro.
Je ferai tout pour vous aider.
C'est pour ça que je suis là.
Pouvez-vous parler au directeur ?
De quoi ?
Je voudrais dormir à Oz.
Donner une cellule à Sippel ?
En attendant qu'il trouve
une chambre.
Je dois consulter le registre.
Il ne sera pas à Em City.
C'est risqué.
Il en est conscient.
Sans emploi,
il ne trouvera pas de logement.
Je cherche un employeur
pour un prêtre défroqué.
Moi !
Vous ?
Ce sera mon assistant.
J'ai des fonds discrétionnaires
du diocèse.
J'utiliserai ma discrétion.
Il y a peu de place, mais...
J'apprécie, mon père.
J'avais besoin de...
Je suis mal organisé.
Vous êtes gêné avec moi.
Bureau de l'aumônier.
Je le lui dirai.
Un patient de l'hôpital
réclame l'extrême onction.
Je suis là pour vous aider.
Laissez-moi vous aider.
Il pardonne vos injustices,
soulage vos maux,
Il rachète votre vie,
Il vous offre
Sa compassion.
Notre Père qui es aux cieux,
accorde à Joseph
le réconfort.
Au nom de Notre Seigneur.
M. Hanssel ?
Je suis le père Mukada.
Merci de me recevoir.
La presse a beaucoup parlé
de la loi
obligeant les délinquants sexuels
à se faire enregistrer
et de la libération
du père Sippel.
Ça a réveillé
beaucoup de choses en moi.
Il sait que vous venez.
Il accepte de me parler ?
Il pense
qu'il vous doit bien ça.
C'est ma 1ère visite
en prison.
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
un surveillant sera présent.
Pour protéger qui ? Moi ou lui ?
Pardon. Je n'ai pas l'intention
de lui faire du mal.
En fait, je ne sais pas
quelles sont mes intentions.
Je ne l'ai pas revu depuis...
Cette saloperie est en moi
depuis 10 ans.
Désolé de dire "saloperie".
Parfois, "saloperie"
est le mot qui s'impose.
Oui ?
Comment tu peux te supporter ?
Et toi ?
Moi, j'ai agi
pour une bonne cause.
J'ai transgressé des lois
qui existent à tort.
Mais toi...
tu es un sale violeur !
- Tu mérites de crever !
- Dans ta cage !
Tu veux pas me donner
le plaisir d'utiliser ça, non ?
Bravo, Vern !
Merci.
Je fais mon boulot.
Pour une fois,
je comprends ce con de nazi.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Un petit moment de détente.
Avec qui ?
Sippel.
Reste pas là !
Calmez-vous.
Je suis calme.
On ne dirait pas.
C'est normal,
on est enfermées
dans une cellule, vous et moi.
Respirez.
Vous devez toucher
peu de femmes !
Ça se voit.
Vous me manipulez
comme si j'étais un homme.
Je vous traite comme un patient.
C'est vrai.
Les médecins doivent
réprimer leurs émotions.
C'est faux, on compatit.
Regardez-moi.
La compassion, cette belle chose
qui permet d'être humain
tout en dominant les autres.
Tout va bien. C'est fini.
Je vais assez bien pour mourir ?
Assez bien pour être exécutée ?
Ecoutez, je ne comprends pas
comment une femme,
une mère, peut faire ça
à la chair de sa chair.
C'était un accident.
La prochaine fois
qu'on se verra,
je m'apprêterai à vous faire
une injection fatale.
Merci, chéri.
C'est quoi,
le contraire de s'évader ?
Je veux dire,
être dans un endroit
qui t'absorbe de plus en plus,
au point de te faire sortir
de l'autre côté.
Je peux avoir des Quaaludes
et des Katies, à l'hosto...
Hernandez,
tes pieds !
Tu piges ou je dois traduire ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Hernandez fait le malin.
Raoul,
je vais te le demander
une fois gentiment.
Tu veux bien enlever tes pieds
de la table ?
Merci. Allons-y, Eugene.
Alvarez,
Rivera a toujours ses yeux.
Tu fais ton boulot
ou tu te dégonfles ?
J'attends le bon moment.
Ferme-la ou c'est tes yeux
que j'arrache !
Essaie.
Laisse tomber !
Aujourd'hui, petit blanc.
Aujourd'hui,
Michael.
J'ai des billets pour le match.
Quelle équipe ?
Chicago. Tu viens ?
Non, j'ai un rendez-vous.
Je vais voir Sippel à l'hôpital.
Au moins, il sait où dormir !
Vous savez
qui a crucifié Sippel ?
Pas encore.
Un surveillant
est sûrement impliqué.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Mon Dieu !
Mes yeux !
- Un surveillant !
- De l'aide !
Bouclage général !
De la glace !
Il n'est pas à Em City.
Passez la prison
au peigne fin !
Bouclage général !
Ça va ?
Il n'a plus d'yeux.
Et il a besoin
d'une transfusion.
Il est AB-,
la banque du sang est à court.
Trouvez quelqu'un de ce groupe
à Oz.
On examine
les dossiers du personnel,
ça prend du temps.
Fermez votre gueule !
On inspecte chaque cellule,
Alvarez reste introuvable.
Mon Dieu !
Pas d'AB- dans le personnel.
Parmi les détenus,
il y en a un de ce groupe.
- Amenez-le.
- Qui est-ce ?
Ryan O'Reilly.
Je vous emmerde !
Une vie est en jeu.
Une vie de maton !
Nom de Dieu, O'Reilly !
Arrête tes conneries,
ne perdons pas de temps !
Il y a deux façons
de me prendre du sang.
Vous m'attachez...
ou vous mettez mon frère Cyril
à Em City.
Miguel, réfléchis bien.
J'essaie !
Tu n'as aucune chance.
La brigade va nous retrouver.
Que feras-tu ?
Ils sont armés.
Tu veux qu'on te tire dessus ?
S'ils m'attrapent,
ils vont me démolir.
Je les en empêcherai, promis.
C'est des conneries !
Vous ferez quoi ?
Vous brandirez un crucifix ?
Allongez-vous.
Je me rappelle
des histoires de mon grand-père.
Comment il a tué le mec
qui a coupé
la langue de mon père.
Il a fini au trou.
Vous l'avez connu.
Il y a passé 20 ans.
20 ans au trou.
Et puis, la maladie d'Alzheimer
l'a rendu dingue !
Vous vous rendez compte ?
Passer le reste de ma vie
dans une pièce minuscule...
sans personne,
que des connards de matons !
Putain !
Je pourrai pas.
C'est pas possible.
Je supporte pas
les espaces réduits.
Rester dans une petite pièce,
ça me rendrait vite cinglé !
Si on m'envoie au trou,
autant me tabasser à mort.
On a traversé des épreuves ensemble.
Tu dois me croire
quand je te dis...
que tu n'as pas le choix.
Mais si.
Vous voyez ça ?
Quand j'ai fait ça,
j'avais perdu la boule.
Je m'en rends compte.
Vous savez
ce que j'aurais dû faire ?
Me trancher la gorge !
Non, Miguel. Tu ne sais pas
ce que tu dis. Regarde-moi.
Priez pour moi, mon père.
Je t'en supplie !
Ne lui faites pas de mal !
Je vous en prie !
Je le lui ai promis.
Lâchez-moi, merde !
Non, je vous en prie !
Ne me laissez pas là !
Pitié !
Laissez-moi sortir !
Bouclage terminé.
Ils ont dû retrouver Alvarez.
Il sera accusé
de tentative de meurtre
et on le laissera mourir
au trou.
Je me sens coupable.
Je l'ai sous-estimé.
Finalement, il avait des couilles.
Gloria,
il faut que je vous parle.
Que pourriez-vous me dire ?
"Je regrette" ?
Comment va Rivera ?
Je me prononcerai plus tard.
Cyril a été transféré à Em City.
J'ai bousillé la vie
de plein de gens.
Mon frère est attardé
à cause de moi.
On était à un enterrement.
Il y avait une de mes ex.
Elle était avec son mec,
un caïd.
Mais elle et moi,
on se plaisait encore.
<i>Lâche-la, enfoiré !</i>
<i>Dégage !</i>
Cyril a eu des lésions cérébrales
en me défendant.
Quand les médecins m'ont dit
que Cyril serait plus le même,
qu'il aurait 5 ans d'âge mental,
j'étais effondré.
Alors, je me suis défoncé.
J'ai perdu les pédales.
Depuis que je suis là,
j'ai agi uniquement dans le but
d'avoir ma conditionnelle.
Mais...
ce que j'éprouve pour Gloria...
m'a aveuglé.
Et j'ai reperdu les pédales.
Maintenant, Cyril est à Oz
pour les 60 ans à venir,
il a été violé par Schillinger
et il a peur.
Il faut que je reste avec Cyril.
Il faut que je le protège.
Pour une fois
dans ma putain de vie,
je vais être son grand frère.
Tu as fait tuer
le mari de Gloria par Cyril.
Oui.
Tu vas être accusé.
C'est ce que je mérite.
Fous le camp !
Ça va ?
J'ai vidé le placard de Preston,
j'ai rangé ses affaires
dans des boîtes.
Il avait 7 boutons
de manchette dépareillés.
Qui garderait ça ?
Quand on en perd un,
on jette l'autre.
Et qui porte
des boutons de manchette ?
Il était chic.
Tu veux qu'on aille dîner ?
Non, merci.
En tout bien, tout honneur.
Au fait...
pour O'Reilly...
Tu crois qu'il t'aime vraiment ?
Personne ne m'aimera jamais
autant que lui.
Je dois vivre avec cette idée
pour le restant de mes jours.
On peut s'évader d'Oz
par des moyens détournés :
héroïne, alcool...
Tu en gaves ton cerveau
et c'est presque aussi bon
que la liberté.
Le problème, c'est qu'à force,
tu deviens prisonnier
d'autre chose
et c'est encore plus dur
de s'évader du vide qui suit.
<i>Je t'aime.</i>
<i>Je t'aime.</i>
Chris, enfin !
Embrasse-moi.
Tu es saoûl.
Putain, tu peux le dire !
Je t'ai manqué ?
Ce que tu m'as manqué.
Viens, on va baiser.
J'ai pas envie qu'on baise.
Ni qu'on soit
dans la même piaule.
Où tu vas ?
Me touche pas ! Dégage !
Tu es fâché contre moi ?
Laisse tomber.
Si c'est ma faute, je regrette.
Parle moins fort.
Ecoute,
j'ai eu le temps de réfléchir.
C'est fini entre nous.
Mais pourquoi ?
Dessoûle et on parlera.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Laisse-moi tranquille !
Si c'est parce que je bois,
je peux arrêter !
Alors ?
Depuis que je suis sorti du trou,
je parle plus à Beecher.
Oui, je l'ai vu.
C'est une épave.
Il est au bord du gouffre.
Il est temps qu'on le pousse.
Tu es dans un sale état.
Ces derniers jours ont été durs.
Un peu d'exercice
te fera du bien.
Tu le connais ?
Oui, depuis longtemps !
Je l'ai connu
quand on purgeait une peine
à Lardner.
J'avais 17 ans.
Il m'a sauvé d'un sale négro
qui en voulait à mon cul.
Depuis, je lui suis redevable.
Je t'aime pas.
Je t'ai jamais aimé.
Lâchez-le.
Cette fois, c'est pour de bon !
A mon tour.
Il a les bras
et les jambes cassés ?
Et s'il veut se gratter ?
On aurait dit un bretzel !
- Il était amoureux de Keller.
- L'amour fait souffrir.
C'est Schillinger.
Ce con de Schillinger a fait ça.
Je veux m'installer ici.
La vue est plus belle.
Qui a emmené Beecher
à la salle de gym ?
Je ne sais pas,
mais je trouverai.
Qu'est-ce que tu sais
de Karl Metzger ?
Seulement ce qui est
dans son dossier.
Je le sens pas, ce type.
Il y a plein de façons
de s'évader d'Oz.
On peut creuser un tunnel,
mourir
ou s'échapper à travers son âme.
Nappa nous a piqué notre came.
Il a ma came ?
Il a eu le paquet avant nous.
Je sais pas comment il a su.
Faut buter ce Rital.
- On le fera.
- Quand ?
Tu passes ton temps
au lit depuis quelques jours !
On te remplace à la cuisine,
mais on en a ras le bol !
Tu me donnes des ordres ?
Je sais pourquoi tu es là.
Tu es un féticheur, tu vois l'avenir
dans ces coquillages.
Ils m'avaient dit
qu'on se rencontrerait.
Si tu es si malin,
pourquoi tu es en taule ?
Détenu matricule 98J604,
Kipkemie Jara.
Condamné le 1er août 1998
pour homicide par négligence.
Peine : 20 ans.
Conditionnelle au bout de 8 ans.
Si je suis là, c'est pour toi.
Si tu changes pas,
si tu continues à te droguer,
à être violent,
tu mourras.
C'est l'avenir de tout le monde.
Depuis quand tu es en Amérique ?
15 ans.
Tu vois ?
Tu as oublié ce que signifie...
La patrie ?
Ta patrie, là d'où tu viens.
Tu es là depuis trop longtemps.
Tu sais pas qui tu es.
Tu fais honte à notre peuple.
Notre peuple ?
Notre peuple qui accepte
qu'on nous exploite ?
Notre peuple qui protège pas
ce qu'on a ?
Quoi qu'il en soit,
quand on meurt,
notre âme retourne
sur le lieu de notre naissance.
Tu as abandonné ce lieu.
Il faut te convertir
si tu veux la paix.
Simon, votre analyse d'urine
est négative.
Vous voyez ?
J'ai arrêté la drogue.
C'est bien.
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
J'ai un courage de lion.
Dites donc !
Vous avez l'air heureux.
Vous aviez raison.
En sniffant ces saloperies,
j'évitais un truc :
moi-même.
Mais vous savez,
depuis que je suis arrivé à Oz,
j'ai trouvé...
Une famille.
Nappa prétend qu'il est le patron.
Il a la came
et tient Adebisi par les couilles.
Il délire ! J'emmerde Nappa !
J'hésite à faire confiance
à Adebisi.
Putain,
il suffit de le regarder !
Je me souviens de la paix.
Je me souviens...
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
C'était mal, ce que tu as dit.
Mais à Oz, le mal, c'est bien.
Adebisi et ses gars
commencent à craquer.
Encore quelques jours
et on les tient.
Parfait. Il faut
que tu me trouves autre chose.
Oui, quoi ?
Adebisi a arrêté la drogue,
mais quelqu'un
lui bousille le cerveau.
Tu parles de Jara ?
Il se passe de drôles de trucs.
O'Reilly, tu en prends ?
Plus maintenant.
La came, c'est que pour l'argent.
Bosser avec toi est un plaisir.
Le vieux Jara...
Je veux sa mort.
Ça pue l'ail !
Du calme.
On est pas là pour se battre.
Adebisi a complètement déjanté.
Il est un peu malade, c'est tout.
Je contrôle toute la dope à Oz.
Vous êtes foutus.
Au lieu de nous tirer
dans les pattes,
si on travaillait ensemble ?
On a pas besoin de vous.
Réfléchis un peu.
Qui récupérera toute la dope
qui arrive ici ?
Prends la bonne décision.
On sera pas tes putes.
On travaille ensemble,
on partage.
Marché conclu ?
En signe de bonne foi,
je veux
que tu fasses quelque chose.
Pourquoi ce vieux con
travaille ici ?
C'est un boulet.
Ta gueule, Kenny !
Je manque de maïs.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
J'étouffe !
Ne parle pas.
J'appelle de l'aide.
Aidez-moi !
Ne parle pas.
Je rentre
à la maison.
Au revoir.
Ne m'abandonne pas !
Tu entends les tam-tams ?
Tu les entends ?
Adebisi, calme-toi.
Ça va, calme-toi.
Tenez-le !
On t'emmène
pour pouvoir discuter.
Regagnez vos cellules !
Tu sais forcément
ce qu'il s'est passé !
J'en sais rien.
Adebisi se désintoxique
et il devient dingue.
Il a poignardé
ce gentil petit vieux.
Je sais vraiment pas...
Il y a des moyens légaux
de quitter Oz :
la conditionnelle,
la cour d'appel
et il y a la grâce.
La grâce, ça a l'air de rien, hein ?
Ça semble tellement purifiant.
Tu peux téléphoner.
Merci, mon frère.
Kareem Saïd à l'appareil.
J'ai une interview à 10h30.
Oui, je suis là.
Je précise
qu'hélas, je connais peu
votre émission de radio.
A Oswald, on ne peut voir
et entendre que certaines choses.
C'est une des raisons pour lesquelles
j'ai écrit mon livre.
On devrait interdire
les jurons.
Fait chier !
Suce-moi !
- Torche-cul !
- Enfoiré !
Connard !
Tapette !
Si personne
n'a mieux à dire,
la réunion est ajournée.
Je le raccompagne.
C'est au sujet du Poète.
J'ai essayé de lui parler,
mais il se bloque.
Tu peux lui parler ?
Pourquoi ?
Pour essayer d'avoir un contact
avec lui, le faire repartir.
J'ai fait mon possible pour lui.
Vous aussi.
J'en ai fini avec lui.
Attends un peu !
Je croyais que toute âme
pouvait être rachetée,
qu'il fallait jamais renoncer !
Ah bon, McManus ?
Quand j'ai été arrêté,
je me suis dit :
"C'est la volonté d'Allah.
J'irai à Oz
et j'aiderai mes frères."
Et tu ne l'as pas fait.
Parfois, j'ai la même impression.
Je sais, McManus. Je le vois.
Sauf que le soir,
vous rentrez chez vous.
Vous êtes libre
de changer de boulot.
Je vais passer 17 ans ici.
Je pense souvent à ce que
j'aurais pu faire d'autre.
Fonder un foyer ?
Ce sera encore possible
quand tu sortiras.
Après 20 ans de détention,
que pourrais-je offrir
à une épouse ?
Ou à un enfant ?
Ta foi.
Je pensais
que la foi te soutenait.
C'est vrai.
La plupart du temps.
Votre attention !
Les détenus suivants
sont attendus par le directeur.
97F444, Kareem Saïd.
97A622, Zahir Arif.
89B267, Nasim Bismilla.
85A245, Sanjay Afsana.
Assieds-toi.
Chaque année, le gouverneur
gracie des détenus.
Pour Noël.
Cette année,
il a décidé de le faire
pour la Pâque juive
et le Ramadan.
Je sais.
J'ai travaillé avec d'autres
leaders islamiques dans ce but.
Devlin souhaite qu'on étudie
les dossiers des musulmans
et qu'on en recommande un.
Mais il a suggéré ton nom.
C'est un piège, non ?
Ça cache quelque chose.
A quoi devrais-je renoncer ?
A rien.
La question est :
si le gouverneur t'offre
la grâce, accepteras-tu ?
Oui.
Réjouissons-nous pour ceux
qui sont choisis.
Surtout si c'est toi.
Arif ?
Pardonne-moi.
Mais j'ai des enfants.
Je sais qu'on s'en occupe,
mais c'est pas pareil.
Je leur manque,
ils me manquent.
Je sais.
Vraiment ?
- Il y en a que pour Saïd.
- C'est la volonté d'Allah.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Quelle folie !
Viens.
C'est toi,
c'est toi que Devlin a choisi.
Le Ramadan commence jeudi.
Il donne une conférence de presse.
Je devrais te féliciter, mais...
Mais quoi ? Ne me dîtes pas
que je vais vous manquer.
Non, pas du tout.
C'est que...
tout ça me dépasse un peu.
Le Ramadan est au centre
de la religion islamique.
Par conséquent, je suis ravi,
dans la tradition
de cette période sainte,
de gracier un détenu.
Kareem Saïd
a ouvertement critiqué
notre administration.
Malgré nos divergences politiques,
il a été un détenu remarquable.
Malgré son infarctus,
il a continué à aider
les détenus de toutes les races
pour les instruire
et les guider
vers une vie meilleure.
Par la déclaration présente,
j'accorde à Kareem Saïd
le pardon total
et je lui souhaite bonne chance.
On se voit enfin face à face.
Qu'éprouvez-vous ?
Ce que j'éprouve ?
J'éprouve de la tristesse.
Mes frères restent derrière,
emprisonnés, opprimés.
Pas seulement les musulmans,
<i>mais tous ceux qui dormiront ici
ce soir,</i>
<i>privés de ce qu'ils aiment,</i>
<i>privés d'eux-mêmes.</i>
<i>Quand on a su qu'un détenu
allait être gracié,</i>
<i>un élan</i>
<i>s'est développé,</i>
<i>car chacun
espérait être l'élu.</i>
<i>L'envie de liberté</i>
<i>était aussi palpable
que de la nourriture.</i>
Mais c'est un repas
qu'on est en train de me servir,
et en tant que musulman,
Allah m'interdit
d'avaler certaines choses.
Allah m'interdit les miettes
offertes par un homme
tel que lui.
Un homme corrompu
et immoral.
Un homme qui dénigre la grâce
et viole les lois,
un homme qui a donné l'ordre
qui a causé la mort
de 8 personnes.
C'est pourquoi,
Gouverneur Devlin,
parce que le prix
de cette liberté est trop élevé,
je refuse votre pardon !
Ramenez-le à l'intérieur.
Enfoiré !
Tout le monde veut s'évader d'Oz.
Bien sûr, la vérité,
c'est qu'il n'y a pas d'issue.
Imaginons que tu arrives
à t'enfuir,
il faut alors que tu coures,
sans t'arrêter.
Vivre en courant,
c'est pas une vie.
Mieux vaut affronter la réalité,
tirer le meilleur parti
de ce qu'on a.
On juge pas un homme
sur l'endroit où il vit,
mais sur le parti
qu'il en tire.
Tire le meilleur parti
des choses.
A plus !

Transcript et synchro : Chris2003
C’est comme ça qu’on appelle
le pénitencier de haute sécurité d’Oswald.
Sauf que, scoop : le nom a été changé.
<i>Maintenant, c’est le Centre
de détention d’État d’Oswald, niveau 4.</i>
Je ne vois pas la différence.
Léo Glynn est toujours directeur.
Sœur Peter Marie
est toujours en psychiatrie.
Tim McManus est encore
le directeur de la cité d’émeraude.
Et une chose est sûre :
Nous, on n’a pas changé.
<i>Beecher est toujours à l’hôpital,
Schillinger et Keller lui ont brisé les os.</i>
<i>Alvarez est encore au trou
après avoir enlevé la vue à un gardien.</i>
<i>Adebisi est toujours chez les dingues
depuis qu’il a changé du tout au tout.</i>
Peut-être que la pub peut marcher.
Peut-être qu’en virant
le mot « pénitencier »,
l’État finit par admettre
que personne ne fait pénitence.
Personne ne regrette.
Personne.
Continuant mon effort
de réduction des frais de l’État,
j’ai pris l’initiative de confier
certains services du gouvernement
à des entreprises extérieures.
<i>Aujourd’hui, j’ai le plaisir d’annoncer</i>
<i>que Weigert, une société
de soins médicaux privés</i>
<i>s’occupera du système de santé
dans notre prison.</i>
<i>Ceci fera économiser 28 millions de dollars
aux contribuables.</i>
Va te faire voir.
<i>Ce sont les coûts qui seront réduits,
pas la qualité.</i>
Je vous présente le Dr Frederick Garvey,
qui va diriger l’équipe
Weigert. Dr Garvey.
Merci, monsieur le gouverneur.
Weigert tient à offrir
les meilleurs soins possibles
aux 36000 détenus
qui purgent leur peine dans notre État.
Pour ce faire, nous allons employer
le meilleur personnel.
Bien qu’il soit impossible
de promettre un travail à tous,
nous espérons garder
autant d’employés que possible,
tout en offrant des salaires
et des avantages compétitifs. Merci.
<i>Le cachot.</i>
<i>En 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville</i>
<i>est venu étudier
notre système pénitentiaire.</i>
<i>Les prisons américaines passaient pour
le lieu de réhabilitation idéal.</i>
<i>Mettre un criminel au cachot lui donnait
le temps de réfléchir tranquillement.</i>
<i>Mais nul ne veut penser à soi
toute la journée,</i>
<i>se retrouver confronté
à soi tous les jours</i>
<i>pour le restant de sa vie.</i>
« Alvarez, Miguel. »
On lui donne 200 mg de Prozac.
Il a des antécédents dépressifs
à tendance suicidaire.
- Sœur Peter Marie a fait le diagnostic ?
- En me consultant.
Enfin, le Prozac, ça ne sert à rien.
Alvarez est au trou,
probablement jusqu’à la fin de ses jours.
Pourquoi lui faire avaler ces pilules ?
- Il n’est dangereux pour personne.
- Sauf pour lui-même.
Je vous dis
qu’il a tendance à l’autodestruction.
À partir de demain,
Alvarez arrête les antidépresseurs.
Désolé, j’ai les mains liées.
Quand le gouverneur a fait ce marché,
le contrat stipulait
que Weigert s’occuperait de l’aspect médical
sans interférence de ma part.
Mais, Léo, tu peux appeler personne ?
Le président de la société ?
Weigert est une filiale de Medmore
qui appartient elle-même
à un conglomérat de Berlin,
<i>et je ne parle pas sehr gut allemand.</i>
Alors, on ne fait rien ?
On laisse Miguel Alvarez
sombrer dans la dépression ? C’est ça ?
Autant lui apporter ses médocs
tant qu’il est encore temps.
Ouais. Dépêche-toi.
Écoute, Miguel,
je veux t’expliquer quelque chose.
Ces pilules que je te donnais
pour te calmer,
pour que tu te sentes mieux,
je ne vais plus t’en apporter.
Tu ne vas plus venir me voir ?
Non.
Pas aussi souvent.
Mon grand-père me l’a dit.
Qu’est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Il m’a dit hier que tu n’allais plus venir
me rendre visite.
Ton grand-père ?
Hier ?
Miguel, ton grand-père est décédé.
Ne pars pas.
J’ai d’autres patients.
Miguel.
Tu sais, je...
J’aimais bien travailler à l’infirmerie
comme aide-soignant.
J’aimais bien travailler avec toi.
Tu étais là pour moi.
Il m’a dit qu’il avait parlé
à son grand-père,
hier.
Enfin, sœur Peter Marie
continuera à s’occuper de lui.
Mais Miguel et vous avez une relation
privilégiée depuis son arrivée à Oz.
On s’est dit
qu’on devait vous mettre au courant.
C’est gentil. Je m’apprêtais
à aller donner la communion au cachot.
Je connais des centaines
de jeunes des banlieues comme Miguel.
J’en ai vu beaucoup arriver ici.
Beaucoup d’entre eux sont morts.
Je ne sais pas combien de temps
je vais tenir comme ça.
Merci.
Miguel ?
Je suis venu t’apporter
la sainte communion.
Je vous ai déjà dit
que je ne pouvais pas communier
parce qu’avant ça,
je dois aller à confesse
et je ne peux pas me confesser.
Pourquoi ?
Vous pouvez nous laisser seuls ?
Ce que tu diras restera entre toi et Dieu.
Je ne suis pas obligé de le dire.
C’est toujours la même chose.
Je raconte la façon
dont Rivera est devenu aveugle
et vous me dites de faire
ce qui est juste.
Et je devrais balancer
tous ceux qui étaient impliqués ?
Je ne ferai pas ça.
Parce que tu ne veux pas,
ou que tu ne peux pas ?
Vous avez prononcé des vœux
pour devenir prêtre, non ?
Moi, j’ai fait ça
en devenant membre d’El Norte.
J’ai rendu visite à ton grand-père
dans cette cellule. Ou bien celle d’à côté.
C’était celle-ci. Et il est encore ici.
On a parlé de Maritza et toi
et de votre bébé.
Tu te rappelles comme tu étais triste
quand le bébé est mort ?
Ces hosties, elles sont faites comment ?
Avec de la farine.
Et merde. Donnez-m’en une.
Je ne peux pas te donner d’hostie...
Miguel ! J’ai dit...
Ne me faites pas mal.
Par pitié, ne me faites pas mal.
Pourquoi as-tu fait ça ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Cette pièce sera un confessionnal
et vous me promettez
de ne rien dire à personne, putain.
Très bien.
Ce qui s’est passé avec Rivera, c’est ça ?
C’est un maton. Alors tous les autres
matons oublient de me nourrir.
Ils oublient souvent ?
Je mange seulement deux fois par semaine.
- Merde ! Miguel, il faut...
- Vous m’avez promis.
On ne me donne pas d’eau.
Qu’est-ce que tu bois ?
L’eau des toilettes.
Ma pisse.
- 88P217.
- 96J522.
98A498...
À la cité d’émeraude,
vous suivez le programme.
On vous dit quand dormir, quand manger,
quand travailler, quand chier.
Suivez la règle : on ne crie pas,
on ne se bat pas, on ne baise pas.
Voici vos parrains. Ils vous aideront
à vous intégrer à la vie d’Oz.
Kareem Said, Hamid Khan,
Raoul Hernandez, Carlo Ricardo,
Kenny Wangler, Malcolm Coyle.
<i>Matricule 99C122, Malcolm Coyle.</i>
- Quoi, enculé ?
- Lâche ça !
<i>Condamné le 17 janvier 1999.</i>
Vol caractérisé,
vol à main armée, agression armée,
agression d’un policier.
Une peine de 50 ans.
Liberté conditionnelle dans 20 ans.
- Salut, c’est mon pote renoi, Coyle.
- Comment ça va ? Je m’appelle Snake.
- Salut, Snake.
- Arnold Jackson.
Arnold ? Et lui c’est Willy ?
Ouais. Ça, c’est Arnold.
Avant, on l’appelait le Poète.
Je n’écris plus de poèmes.
Quand même,
trouve-toi un autre nom qu’Arnold.
Vous foutez quoi ?
Vous matez une émission pour gamins ?
<i>- C’est pas vraiment pour les gamins.
- C’est La classe de Mlle Sally.</i>
SOIS UN BON AMI
<i>La classe de Mlle Sally ?
Des marionnettes pourries, ouais.</i>
Attends.
Putain, vise-moi ces pastèques !
Putain, qu’elle est bonne !
- La nana !
- Quel cul, ces marionnettes !
- Hé, Wangler.
- Quoi ?
M. Nappa veut te voir.
- Nappa.
- Kenny.
Non. Bricks.
Je l’ai dit des milliers de fois : Bricks.
Kenny Wangler, c’est terminé.
- Bricks.
- Sois poli avec M. Nappa.
C’est bon, Chucky.
Lui et moi, on fait des affaires ensemble.
Pas de formalités entre nous.
Demain, la pharmacie est ouverte.
Je ne veux pas que Snake en sache trop
au sujet de notre opération.
C’est mon pote. Il est cool.
En tout cas, il a l’air.
Ça ne suffit pas d’avoir l’air.
Ne lui dit rien avant d’être sûr
que c’est pas une balance.
- Comment savoir ?
- Teste-le.
Le tester ? Je fais quoi ?
Dans ton quartier, vous n’avez pas
un moyen de tester la loyauté d’un type ?
Si, on a un truc du genre.
Arrêtez !
Regarde, enculé. Lève-toi, renoi.
Regarde ça.
Un peu d’amour.
Il est des nôtres.
Les confessions de prison.
Il ne faut pas les prendre
au pied de la lettre.
Bien sûr, il est possible
que le prisonnier qui se confesse
dise la vérité.
Mais en général, c’est une semi-vérité.
La « semi-vérité ».
Pourquoi on n’appelle jamais ça
un semi-mensonge ?
- Non.
- Toi qui étais toujours si propre.
Attends.
<i>Tapiro. Il bossait
en psychiatrie, ce soir-là.</i>
Ça ne va pas te faire mal.
<i>Il n’en croyait pas ses yeux.
Adebisi qui protégeait Schibetta.</i>
<i>Et qui lavait le visage du gamin...</i>
Allez comprendre. Adebisi encule Schibetta
et puis en fait son protégé ?
Oui, tout le monde dit
qu’Adebisi a changé,
mais je me pose des questions.
Tapiro pense
qu’il quitte bientôt l’unité psychiatrique.
Ça, ça peut nous être utile.
Simon, j’ai décidé
de te renvoyer en cellule.
Vous pensez que je suis prêt ?
Voilà un mois
que je réduis ton dosage de Xanax
et tu n’as jamais fait preuve de violence.
Alors, oui, tu es prêt.
La question, c’est : est-ce que je te remets
à la cité d’émeraude ?
J’espère que oui.
Mais si c’est pas le cas, je comprendrai.
C’est à cause de tous les ennuis
que j’ai causés.
Beaucoup de gens là-bas t’en veulent.
Je vais demander pardon
à chacun de ceux que j’ai blessés,
en commençant par vous, McManus.
Je suis désolé.
Excuses acceptées. Allons-y.
- Adebisi est de retour.
- Comment ça va, l’Africain ?
- Est-ce qu’il va bien ?
- Il revient de la jungle.
Je pensais
que l’Afrique était la voie de mon salut.
Mais rien n’est pur en Afrique.
Tout est arriéré, malsain et corrompu.
Je dansais en rond.
Je ne veux pas vivre dans une hutte.
En prenant la vie de Jara,
tu as sauvé la mienne.
Merci.
J’aimerais recommencer
à travailler en cuisine, s’il te plaît.
D’accord.
Mais on a passé un accord avec Wangler.
Je ne veux pas que tu vendes d’héro.
Fais-moi confiance.
La drogue, c’est terminé.
C’est quoi, ce délire ?
Tu le crois pas, si ?
Peut-être que oui, peut-être que non.
Ses conneries sur l’Afrique, la confiance ?
Il nous mène en bateau.
- Ça reste à voir.
- Pas question. Je vais l’éclater...
Ne le touche pas
sans que j’en donne l’ordre.
- Des conneries ! Tu peux parler.
- C’est pas des conneries.
Va faire un tour.
Pourquoi ne pas le laisser tuer Adebisi ?
Ça ne change rien pour nous.
Wangler est un peu trop sûr de lui.
Si le repentir de notre ami
nigérian est réel,
il nous sera peut-être très utile vivant.
Allez, les gars, on se bouge.
Vous avancez comme des tortues, ce matin.
- Adebisi, qu’est-ce que tu magouilles ?
- Rien.
C’est à moi que tu parles.
Tu vas me dire que tu vas pas te venger
des Ritals et de Wangler ?
C’est ça.
Je sais pas ce qu’on t’a filé
comme médocs à l’asile,
mais j’espère que t’en as pour les autres.
Putain, regarde où tu mets les pieds.
Excusez-moi.
Il n’a pas l’air si dur que ça.
Bouge, Adebisi.
Oui, chef.
- Ils ont changé le nom ?
- Ouais, ça assure, hein ? Signez ici.
Mon père travaillait ici.
Vous l’avez peut-être connu.
Samuel Hughes.
Sammy Hughes, mais oui.
Vous êtes le fils de Sammy ?
Votre père, on le regrette encore.
- Merci.
- Qu’est-ce qui vous amène ici ?
Je viens voir Léo, le directeur,
pour lui demander du travail.
Non. Pas question.
Pourquoi ? J’ai une formation
de gardien de prison. J’ai fini second.
- Ta mère est au courant ?
- Je veux lui faire une surprise.
Ça, ça va en être une.
Elle va faire une crise cardiaque.
Pas si tu me soutiens.
Léo, depuis la mort de papa,
t’as toujours été là pour moi. Me lâche pas.
Bon sang, t’as grandi !
La dernière fois, t’avais sept ans.
Écoute, Léo...
Clayton, j’ai promis à ton père
de prendre soin de toi.
Je veux être gardien de prison.
Comme toi. Comme papa.
- Clayton...
- Léo,
si tu ne m’embauches pas,
une autre prison le fera.
Je vous souhaite la bienvenue
au Centre de détention d’Oswald.
C’est une prison de niveau 4 qui accueille
les hommes les plus dangereux de l’État.
J’ai moi-même été à votre place,
il y a 30 ans.
Mais à l’époque, on était des geôliers
et on portait des casquettes.
Des casquettes atroces.
Le directeur de l’époque nous avait donné
un conseil que j’aimerais vous transmettre.
« Soyez avisés et sur vos gardes. »
J’ajouterai : « Soyez justes. »
De nouveau, je vous dis : « Bienvenue. »
- Sacré discours.
- Ça ne t’a pas plu ?
On dirait que t’as déjà dit
100 fois la même chose.
Alors, tu me mets où ? Au quartier B ?
Au cachot ? Dans le couloir de la mort ?
Là où tu ne crains rien.
Je comprends, mais vous ne pouvez pas
entrer sans permission.
Un instant. Vous pouvez faire la queue ?
Inscrivez votre nom complet.
Merci beaucoup.
Un instant.
Votre nom complet.
- T’es la nouvelle fille.
- Fille ?
Tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Je m’appelle Diane Wittlesey.
Claire Howell.
- Alors, cette première journée ?
- Rien de spécial.
C’est bien.
Je sais pas. J’aime bien un peu d’action.
Attends un peu.
En parlant d’action, qui est le type craquant
qui dirige la cité d’émeraude ?
- Tim McManus ?
- Il est libre ?
Oui, autant que je sache.
Quoi, t’as couché avec lui ?
Eh bien, oui.
Si t’as besoin de quoi que ce soit,
n’hésite pas à me demander.
Ne t’inquiète pas pour moi, mon chou.
Je peux me débrouiller toute seule.
Ça ne m’étonne pas.
Salut. Claire Howell.
On s’est vus tout à l’heure.
- Oui, salut.
- Tu travailles tard ?
Non, je viens de finir, en fait.
On dîne ensemble ?
Est-ce que tu veux dîner avec moi ?
Ne me dis pas que tu ne supportes pas
qu’une femme fasse le premier pas.
Non. En fait, je trouve ça
plutôt courageux.
Alors, t’en dis quoi ?
Il y a un restau roumain juste à côté
que je rêve d’essayer.
Roumain ?
Eh bien, pourquoi pas ?
Je te retrouve sur le parking.
D’accord.
L’amour, voyez-vous...
L’amour est l’ultime semi-vérité.
Tu nous as manqué. Salut.
Asseyez-vous.
Où est maman ?
- Elle n’a pas pu venir.
- Elle a la grippe.
- Elle t’embrasse.
- Et t’envoie ça.
- Cet endroit est craignos.
- Je trouve ça pas mal.
T’es dans l’unité spéciale ?
Ouais, mais c’est bien. C’est propre.
Ça s’appelle la cité d’émeraude.
- C’est là qu’il y a eu l’émeute.
- C’était il y a deux ans.
- Quand même...
- Ça suffit !
Tout ira bien.
Ne vous inquiétez pas pour moi, d’accord ?
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
Carlo, c’était bien,
la visite de ta famille ?
- Oui, ils ont apporté ça.
- C’est bien d’avoir une famille.
Je sais pas.
Tu sais pas quoi ?
Je sais pas.
- Tu sais pas quoi ?
- Ce que c’est d’avoir une famille.
Attends. Tu dis
qu’on n’a pas besoin de famille ?
Ouais, moi, j’en n’ai pas eu besoin.
On m’a envoyé en maison de correction
à neuf ans pour cinq ans.
Je suis sorti, on m’y a renvoyé...
jusqu’à mes 18 ans.
Puis on m’a envoyé à Lardner pour 15 ans.
Quand je suis sorti,
ma famille était soit morte,
soit disparue ou avait coupé les ponts.
Tu as passé toute ta vie...
Tu as été élevé par le système.
Et devine quoi ? J’en suis fier.
- Fier ?
- Tu veux jouer ? Tiens.
<i>Je jure de dire la vérité, toute la vérité,
rien que la vérité. Avec l’aide de Dieu.</i>
<i>Avec l’aide de Dieu.</i>
- C’est quoi, ça ?
- Quoi ?
La lettre que t’as mise dans ta poche.
C’est quoi ?
Quelle lettre ?
- Je t’ai vu.
- T’as besoin de lunettes.
- Donne-la-moi.
- J’ai rien à donner.
Écoute, Hoyt,
si tu commences
à me jouer des tours dans le dos,
je te fais transférer
avant que t’aies le temps de cracher.
<i>Il faut que tu fasses quelque chose
pour moi. Pour moi.</i>
Ryan !
Ça va aller.
T’as encore fait le même cauchemar ?
Hein ? C’est ça ?
Ça va aller, viens.
Ça va aller. Ne t’inquiète pas.
Va te faire foutre.
C’est ton boulot de me servir.
C’est quoi, ton problème ?
- Fiche-moi la paix.
- J’aimerais bien. J’ai des patates à peler.
Je vois. On est fâché contre Schillinger.
T’as pas eu l’occase
de venger le viol de ton frère ?
Je t’emmerde, Arnold.
Pourquoi ne pas mettre du verre moulu
dans sa bouffe, comme Nino Schibetta ?
Il est toujours mort.
- C’est Adebisi qui a tué Nino.
- C’est ça.
Je le buterais bien, mais il a toujours
les Aryens ou les motards avec lui.
J’arrive pas à m’approcher, putain.
À moins que...
À moins.
Qui l’eût cru ? Tu penses comme moi.
C’est flippant.
Jaz, j’ai besoin d’un service.
Je fais pas ça.
Un échange, alors ? Un peu de blanche ?
Dis-moi.
Ça va te foutre dans la merde
avec Schillinger.
Je l’emmerde.
Très bien. J’ai un paquet
qui arrive jeudi.
Il faut qu’il passe aux rayons
sans que le gardien voie ce qu’il y a dedans.
Aucun problème.
Quoi ? Tu ne veux pas savoir
ce que je fais entrer ?
C’est tes oignons.
En plus, tu verras bien
en scannant la boîte, hein ?
Exact.
Je me suis arrangé avec Hoyt.
Il fera en sorte que notre paquet arrive
sans que personne ne soit au courant.
- Un poing américain ?
- Un cadeau d’anniversaire de ma tante.
Je ne le lui ai pas demandé.
Elle est cinglée.
Je vois.
Hoyt, quand tu l’as vu sur l’écran,
pourquoi t’as pas prévenu le gardien ?
- Je l’ai pas vu.
- Pas vu ?
Quand tu regardes l’écran toute la journée,
ta vision se brouille.
C’est ça.
Bonne nouvelle, alors.
Je te change de poste.
Le courrier, c’est terminé,
tu passes à la couture.
Et O’Reily...
préviens ta tante :
l’an prochain, tu veux des chaussettes.
Très drôle.
En attendant, pas de sport
pendant une semaine. Vous pouvez y aller.
- On s’en tire bien.
- Ouais.
C’est pas grâce à ton pote Schillinger.
- Je pensais que vous étiez potes.
- Moi aussi.
À ta place, je lui donnerais une leçon.
Ouvrez la porte, bande d’enculés !
- Tu sais ce qui s’est passé au gymnase ?
- Non.
Les motards ont attaqué Schillinger.
Il est mort ?
Pas une égratignure.
Putain. Merde !
Tu veux des bretzels ?
AIME TON PROCHAIN
Salut. Je m’appelle Shirley.
Je sais. Shirley Bellinger.
Seule femme dans le couloir de la mort.
On dirait bien que je suis le seul homme.
Adam et Eve.
Non. Ce n’est pas vraiment le paradis.
Comment tu t’appelles ?
Richie. Richie Hanlon.
T’as tué qui ?
Personne.
Moi non plus.
Ma fille...
elle est morte par accident quand j’ai perdu
le contrôle de ma voiture, elle a coulé.
Et toi ?
Je suis victime des circonstances.
Tu fais appel.
Pour ton jugement.
- Bien sûr, et toi ?
- Mon procès est la semaine prochaine.
L’avocat dit que la décision peut
être annulée sur un point de procédure.
Je croise les doigts.
Montre-moi ta bite.
Quoi ?
Montre-moi ta bite,
je te montrerai ma chatte.
Je suis gay.
Tu peux bien être portugais.
Je veux pas mourir
sans avoir revu une bite.
Toi et moi, on est tout l’un pour l’autre.
Il faut qu’on s’entraide.
Montre-la-moi.
S’il te plaît, montre-la-moi.
Montre-la-moi.
Sors-la un peu plus.
Eh bien.
Y a un garçon qui a dû être bien content.
L’Amérique blanche pense
que le Noir est criminel par nature.
Donc il y a six fois plus de chances
qu’on aille en prison
qu’un homme blanc, à crime égal.
À Oz, nous devons nous souvenir
du djihad le plus important :
<i>Djihad bin nafs.</i>
C’est la bataille intérieure, mon frère.
La recherche de la pureté.
Hamid, tu es nouveau parmi nous.
Il est essentiel que tu comprennes.
La violence ne doit être exercée
que dans les cas les plus extrêmes.
C’est clair ?
J’ai lu vos livres, M. Said.
Vous êtes déterminé
à renverser le système.
En utilisant le système contre lui-même.
En utilisant leurs lois
pour révéler nos vérités.
Pendant l’émeute,
8 prisonniers ont été tués.
20 autres ont été blessés.
Le conseiller d’État a disculpé le gouverneur
de toute responsabilité.
Mais depuis,
j’ai contacté sans faire de vagues
les familles de tous
les prisonniers décédés,
afin d’intenter un procès collectif
contre l’administration.
Nous espérons
que le jugement sera en notre faveur
et que le gouverneur
sera enfin déclaré coupable.
- Et vous serez l’avocat ?
- Oui, mon frère.
Avec l’un des meilleurs plaideurs du pays :
Arnold Zelman.
Un Juif ?
Remballe ça.
L’œcuménisme est essentiel en ce moment.
En outre, c’est moi qui m’occuperai
du cœur de l’affaire.
Je dois y aller.
J’ai rendez-vous
avec la sœur de Scott Ross.
Scott Ross ? Qui est-ce ?
L’un des prisonniers tués
pendant l’émeute.
- Mlle Ross ?
- Oui ?
Je suis Kareem Said.
Merci d’être venue.
Je m’en veux énormément.
Je n’étais jamais venue voir Scott ici.
Pas une seule fois.
Je voulais, bien sûr.
J’ai failli venir plusieurs fois, mais...
Vous savez, Scott et moi...
on n’a jamais été très proches.
On n’avait pas la même maman.
Mais quand même...
c’était mon frère.
Je suis désolée.
Je m’étais promis de ne pas faire ça.
Merci.
Je suis désolée. Merci.
Ne vous excusez pas, Mlle Ross.
Cet endroit est horrible.
Vous avez tous les droits d’être émue.
J’ai reçu votre lettre...
au sujet du procès.
- Vous dites que les gardiens ont usé...
- De force excessive.
En d’autres mots, ils sont allés bien plus
loin que nécessaire pour casser l’émeute.
Mlle Ross,
votre frère n’aurait pas dû mourir.
Vous joindrez-vous à nous ?
Non.
- Non ? Je peux savoir pourquoi ?
- J’ai grandi avec Scott.
C’était un garçon méchant,
et c’est devenu un homme méchant.
Je ne sais pas vraiment
comment ça se passe,
comment les autres font.
Mais je me dis que si les gardiens
ont brutalisé Scott, c’est qu’il le méritait.
Pourquoi vous me regardez comme ça ?
Désolé.
Mlle Ross, je respecte votre décision.
Mais j’espère que vous changerez d’avis.
Ce procès est une affaire sérieuse.
J’essaie de mettre un terme à la brutalité.
Je sais très bien ce que c’est
que d’être maltraité.
En effet, je vois.
Encore une fois, merci d’être venue.
Ça s’appelle du « métissage ».
Un mélange de races.
M-É-T-I-S-S-A-G-E.
J’ai bien épelé ?
- Qu’est-ce que tu veux ?
- C’est pas la question, Votre Sainteté.
C’est toi. Je t’ai vu dans le parloir
avec la pétasse des banlieues.
C’était un rendez-vous d’affaires.
Quel genre d’affaires ?
Du fricotage de singes ?
Merde, désolé. J’oubliais,
je dois pas vous traiter de singes.
Tout le monde s’assoit.
Asseyez-vous, les garçons.
Demandez-lui pourquoi il fait les yeux doux
à cette Blanche.
Ce n’est pas vrai.
Nie donc. Je sais ce que j’ai vu.
Il y a certaines choses qu’on ne peut
même pas s’avouer à soi-même.
Des envies, des désirs,
qui, s’ils étaient révélés,
vous changeraient à jamais.
Et la façade que vous avez forgé
avec tant de soin
s’effondrerait,
dévoilant à ceux qui vous entourent
ce qui vous excite vraiment.
Busmalis, bouge ton gros cul.
C’est presque fini, monsieur.
C’est bien possible.
Qu’est-ce que vous faites ?
Ça fait quel effet ?
Mark Mack a ressenti ça
quand ton tunnel s’est effondré sur lui.
Exactement.
Je n’ai pas oublié que tu as tué Mark.
Je n’ai jamais cru
que c’était un accident.
Tu étouffes ?
Emmenez-le à l’hôpital.
Tu veux me voir, Rebadow ?
Il y a une urgence ?
Busmalis. Comment va-t-il ?
Il a encore du mal à respirer.
On l’a mis sous oxygène.
Ce type est un nazi.
Busmalis ?
Metzger.
- Il est coriace, je te l’accorde.
- Même vous, vous ne pouvez pas l’ignorer.
Même moi ?
Metzger fait partie
de la fraternité aryenne.
Depuis son arrivée,
les Aryens font ce qu’ils veulent.
Robert Sipple crucifié, Tobias Beecher
qui se fait casser bras et jambes.
Je sais.
Si vous le savez,
pourquoi Metzger garde-t-il son poste ?
Plus pour longtemps.
Je suis peut-être aveugle, mais pas idiot.
- Comment va Busmalis ?
- Ça t’intéresse vraiment ?
Je ne demanderais pas, sinon.
Pourquoi ça t’intéresse ?
T’as fait usage de brutalité
et t’as peur que ce soit dans ton dossier ?
Je n’ai pas été brutal.
Ce type est presque mort.
Mais pas tout à fait.
Oui, parce que tu savais exactement
quand t’arrêter.
C’est quoi, la devise ? « On étrangle
jusqu’à ce que ça pue la merde » ?
- Joli tatouage.
- Une erreur de jeunesse.
Metzger, je sais qui tu es.
Je sais ce que tu es.
La seule chose que je suis,
c’est un membre surqualifié
et sous-payé de l’association
des gardiens de prison bénévoles.
Mais si je suis ce que tu penses,
fais très attention.
C’est une menace ?
Je te rappelle simplement
qui sont tes amis.
Souviens-toi de qui tu veux
avoir à tes côtés
quand l’un de ces enculés
voudra t’étriper.
Avant que Metzger arrive,
il vivait dans le Montana et faisait partie
des Guerriers de la suprématie blanche.
Tu en es certain, Tim ?
Un ami qui travaille
pour le F.B.I. a vérifié.
On ne peut pas virer un type
pour ce qu’il a fait il y a 15 ans.
Je veux des preuves de sa complicité
avec Schillinger
et de sa responsabilité dans
ce qui est arrivé à Busmalis et Beecher.
Personne ne témoignera contre Metzger.
Le syndicat ne nous laissera rien faire
sans preuves.
Les autres gardiens l’aiment beaucoup.
Je veux pas les démoraliser comme ça.
Alors on le garde
jusqu’à ce qu’il tue quelqu’un ?
- Je n’ai pas le choix.
- Même s’il pense que t’es qu’un renoi ?
- Qu’est-ce que tu as dit ?
- Un renoi.
Si t’essaies de m’énerver,
Ça marche très bien.
Je ne veux pas plus que toi
que Metzger reste ici.
Mais pour le virer,
je vais avoir besoin de munitions.
Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
Tobias, tes os ont l’air ressoudés.
Tu vas garder l’attelle encore deux jours,
mais je te renvoie à la cité d’émeraude.
- Prends ça jusqu’à ce que tu sois stable.
- Ça va être utile.
- Et coupe-moi ces ongles.
- Dès que j’aurai regagné ma cellule.
- Salut, Tim.
- Salut, Gloria.
Écoutez, je sais que Karl Metzger
est en partie responsable
de vos deux accidents.
Beecher,
je veux que tu témoignes contre lui.
Toi aussi, Busmalis.
Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles.
Oui, Metzger m’a accompagné au gymnase.
Il m’a laissé là-bas.
Et ensuite ?
Je ne me souviens plus.
L’âme humaine
a une capacité extraordinaire
à effacer les moments pénibles de la vie.
- Salut, Tobias.
- Ce mec était entièrement plâtré.
- Ça va mieux ?
- Il a des analgésiques, c’est sûr.
Beecher.
Oui.
Je sais que tu n’as aucune raison
de me croire, mais...
Tu regrettes ?
Oui.
Et tu promets
que tu ne le referas jamais ?
Toby, je suis sérieux.
Je n’en doute pas.
Durant tes trois mois à l’hôpital,
j’ai eu le temps de penser.
À moi ?
J’ai fait une erreur.
J’ai essayé de trouver une façon
de te prouver que je suis vraiment désolé.
Et que je t’aime.
Et si je t’enculais ?
- Et si tu me cassais le bras ?
- Je vais faire bien plus que ça.
Casse-moi les deux bras. Tords-moi
les jambes, casse-moi tous les os du corps.
Je ne dirai rien aux matons.
Tu me prends pour un con ?
Tu me laisses te casser les jambes...
et puis tu me balances ?
Non, je te le jure.
Jure, promets, prête serment, fait un vœu
et va te faire foutre.
Il y a bien quelque chose
que je peux faire.
Oui.
Il y a un truc que tu peux faire
et qui me fera croire
que tu es vraiment désolé.
C’est quoi ?
Avoue.
Dis à McManus que toi,
Vern et Metzger m’avez attaqué.
Si je fais ça,
ils me coupent les couilles.
Ouais. C’est ça.
Très bien, enculé,
tu veux une confession, c’est ça ?
Tu veux une confession ? D’accord, mais
je laisse Metzger et Schillinger en dehors.
Ça ne suffit pas.
Très bien, je vais tout dire à McManus.
- Je retiens mon souffle.
- Je t’emmerde, connard.
Je dois voir McManus.
Je veux voir McManus.
Emmenez-moi le voir.
Beecher, qu’est-ce qui se passe ?
Je ne sais pas.
Viens avec moi. Allez.
T’en as pas besoin, allez.
Dis-moi ce qui se passe, putain.
Qu’est-ce que t’as raconté à Keller ?
Pourquoi va-t-il voir McManus ?
Je ne sais pas.
Tu le sais très bien, sale pédé.
Dis-le-moi.
Dis-le-moi.
Schillinger, viens.
Que se passe-t-il ?
McManus et Glynn veulent te parler.
À quel sujet ?
Ton petit copain, Keller, a tout avoué.
Il a balancé Metzger et toi
pour l’agression de Beecher.
Mon cul. Il ne ferait jamais ça.
Il l’a fait. Maintenant, faut assumer.
- C’est bien tenté.
- T’as merdé, Vern. Tu lui as fait confiance.
Keller sait que s’il déconne, il est mort.
Pas s’il est en détention protégée,
mon chou.
<i>La vérité est un truc puissant.</i>
<i>Elle peut réparer une offense...</i>
<i>ou empirer un truc déjà pas terrible.</i>
<i>Mais à Oz, la vérité,</i>
<i>c’est que si les faits
ne collent pas à la vérité,</i>
<i>tant pis pour les faits.</i>
Extinction des feux !
Napoléon Bonaparte.
Un Italien pauvre devenu,
en grandissant, empereur des Français
et presque du monde entier.
"En grandissant" n'est peut-être pas le mot,
puisqu'il n'a jamais dépassé 1,58 m.
Mais pas besoin d'être grand
pour compter.
- Metzger est mort.
- Ça s'est passé comment ?
On lui a tranché la gorge.
- Qui ?
- Personne ne sait.
Découvre-le, alors.
- Content qu'il soit mort.
- Il me battait sans raison.
On peut se réjouir
tant qu'un pire enfoiré l'a pas remplacé.
Léo, entre le directeur de la prison
et le chef des gardiens de prison,
- il faut du respect et de la confiance.
- Oui.
Alors, je ne veux pas nommer
quelqu'un qui travaille déjà ici,
qui a déjà ses loyautés et ses préjugés.
Je veux faire venir
une personne extérieure.
- Tu as quelqu'un ?
- Oui, Sean Murphy. Un ami d'enfance.
Il travaille à Attica depuis huit ans.
Je lui confierais ma vie, Léo.
Dans ce boulot, tu seras obligé.
Alors, c'est oui ?
- Je te dis parfois non ?
- Tant mieux,
parce qu'il est déjà en route.
Je comprends pas les matons.
L'un d'entre eux se fait buter,
Ça a pas l'air de les gêner.
Ni confinement, ni enquête,
ni service funèbre.
Ils savaient peut-être
qu'on combinait ensemble.
C'est peut-être à nous
de faire une enquête.
Regarde où tu vas, connard.
Tu as craché dans mon plateau.
Ah oui, sans blague ?
Assieds-toi et mange ça.
Vas-y.
Dépêche. On doit préparer le petit-déj.
On bosse pas à la cuisine ce matin,
je t'ai dit.
- J'ai mon avocat à voir.
- J'ai faim.
Je peux y aller tout seul.
- Non.
- J'ai faim.
T'as fini de me gonfler, Cyril ?
Allez, O'Reily, il me faut de la came.
- Cyril.
- Bonjour.
Jim Robson. Tu te souviens de moi ?
Non.
J'étais au quartier B
quand t'es arrivé à Oz.
Je suis pote avec Vern.
C'est la première fois
que je te vois sans ton frangin.
- Ryan arrive.
- Il est pas marrant.
Mais toi et moi, on pourrait s'amuser.
Si on baisait tous les deux,
paraît que t'es un bon coup, hein ?
Arrête !
- C'est lui qui a commencé !
- Au mitard !
Retourne dans ton quartier.
Salut, Gloria.
Je viens de voir mon avocat.
Comme j'ai avoué
avoir fait tuer votre mari par Cyril,
le procureur a accepté
d'ajouter que 40 ans à ma peine.
Perpète plus 40 ans, Gloria !
Tout ça pour vous.
Je veux voir mon frère.
Quand tu m'as demandé
de venir bosser ici, j'étais...
Inquiet ?
La réputation d'Oz
n'est pas vraiment excellente.
C'est pour ça que je te veux ici.
Toi et moi, ensemble,
on pourrait transformer cet endroit.
Hé, McManus !
- Sortez mon frangin du mitard.
- Il a frappé un autre détenu.
Vous savez bien pourquoi.
Ces connards de nazis se foutent de lui.
Cyril ne cherche pas la bagarre,
vous le savez.
- D'accord.
- C'est des conneries.
J'ai dit d'accord.
Je m'en occuperai. Maintenant, disparais.
- Bon Dieu !
- C'est qui ?
Ryan O'Reily.
- Un bon voyou irlandais.
- Bon, je ne sais pas, mais...
J'ai assisté à la bagarre
et ça m'a fait réfléchir.
À Attica, tu as monté
un tournoi de boxe, non ?
- Oui.
- On pourrait essayer ici.
Génial.
Il suffit d'avoir du temps, des gants,
et une bonne assurance.
Chaque groupe, les musulmans,
les Irlandais, les Italiens, ainsi de suite...
nommeront un boxeur.
Il y aura une série d'éliminatoires,
jusqu'à ce qu'il reste deux finalistes.
- Et là, grand combat de championnat.
- Violence organisée ?
- Ça a marché ailleurs, Ray.
- Il a raison.
Rodéo, base-ball,
rencontres sportives, tout cela détourne
l'agressivité des détenus de façon positive.
Ce n'est pas leur agressivité
qui m'inquiète. C'est le jeu.
Il y aura des paris sans arrêt.
C'est déjà le cas.
Ces types parient sur tout,
du Super Bowl au morpion, bordel !
Ce n'est pas comme la drogue.
Ça ne fait de mal à personne.
Voyons ce qu'en disent les autorités.
- J'ai déjà fait de la boxe.
- Moi aussi.
Où, aux Jeux olympiques des handicapés ?
Mon frère a déjà gagné aux Golden Gloves.
- Il y aura un prix ?
- Non.
- Quel est le but, alors ?
- La gloire de ta tribu.
C'est ça. Frappe-le, l'enfoiré !
Plus fort !
Direct, direct, droite.
<i>Napoléon a dit</i>
<i>qu'on gouvernait mieux les hommes
par leurs vices que par leurs vertus.</i>
<i>Un, deux, trois,</i>
<i>cinq, six, sept, huit...</i>
<i>C'est fini.</i>
Il a dit aussi :
"Du sublime au ridicule,
il n'y a qu'un pas."
Il devait connaître Tim McManus.
Yo, McManus.
J'ai ta nouvelle affectation, Coyle.
Salon de coiffure.
Pourquoi ça ?
Snake bosse à la cuisine avec moi.
Moi qui croyais diriger
ce quartier, Kenny !
Je vous ai dit d'arrêter de m'appeler Kenny.
Moi, c'est Bricks.
Bricks. D'accord.
C'est un coup de Nappa.
- Tu crois ?
- J'en suis sûr.
Ce sale Rital peut pas me blairer.
<i>- Yo, Nappa.
- Sors ces bouteilles de là, pronto.</i>
Yo, Nappa. Le Rital.
On dit M. Nappa.
- Pourquoi renvoyer Snake de la cuisine ?
- C'était pas moi.
McManus avait des projets pour lui.
Fais-le changer d'avis.
Y a des trucs que, même moi,
je peux pas faire.
Me raconte pas de conneries.
D'accord, je l'aime pas.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Moi si.
Faites-vous tous les câlins que vous voulez
dans votre cellule,
mais il bossera pas dans ma cafétéria.
C'est clair, Bricks ?
Maintenant, au boulot.
Comme ça, ton père était coiffeur ?
Oui, j'ai appris en le regardant faire.
Tant mieux.
Une aide éclairée me sera bien utile.
Ceux qu'on m'envoie
voient pas la différence
entre une brosse et une coupe au bol.
Ça te plaît ?
- Bien.
- Tu trouves ? Bon.
- Autre chose ?
- La barbe, j'aimerais bien.
Moi, j'aimerais bien
que Neve Campbell me taille une pipe.
Je vais le raser. Pour me faire la main.
À ton aise, chef.
Je vais en fumer une sur le toit.
Quels cons, ces Blancs !
Mon père a jamais été coiffeur.
T'es paralysé, c'est ça ?
Je veux pas que tu te tires.
- Il est bien aiguisé.
- Coyle.
- Appelle-moi Snake.
- J'ai changé d'avis.
Quoi ? Être rasé de près,
y a rien de mieux.
Te tortille pas ou je risque de te couper.
Pourquoi t'es ici, Augustus ?
Meurtre. J'ai tué un flic.
CHAÎNE DE FORÇATS
Super. Mais je te bats.
J'ai descendu toute une famille.
La maman, le papa,
deux petits gamins adorables,
un vieux grand-père.
Elle t'avait fait quoi, cette famille ?
Que dalle.
- Pourquoi tu les as tués ?
- Pour m'amuser.
- Et tu les as tués comment ?
- Devine.
Tu les as égorgés.
- Pourquoi tu te fous de moi ?
- Je me fous pas de toi.
T'es à Oz pour vol à main armée.
C'est vrai.
On m'a jamais pris pour les meurtres.
- Et on me prendra jamais.
- Donne-moi mon fauteuil roulant.
Oui, mon bon maître. À votre service.
PROPRIÉTÉ DU PÉNITENCIER D'OSWALD
MEURTRE d'une famille avec bébé
La police n'a aucun suspect
Viol barbare de la mère
Vous vous rappelez, il y a quelques mois,
une famille a été assassinée,
les Ciancimino ?
Oui, de façon particulièrement barbare,
il me semble.
On n'a jamais trouvé le tueur.
- Moi, je l'ai trouvé.
- C'est qui ?
Peu importe.
Il m'a dit qu'il l'avait fait, l'enfoiré.
- Tu connais la famille ?
- Non.
Alors où est le blème ?
Je suis pas un saint, loin de là.
J'ai tué quelqu'un.
C'est moche, de supprimer une vie.
Et je paie pour ça.
Envoie ça ici, Seth.
Cet enculé n'a aucun remords.
Il a supprimé ces vies pour le plaisir.
Il n'avait pas de raison de tuer.
Et il s'en sort.
Les jeunes d'aujourd'hui.
Pas de moralité. Ni honneur, ni valeurs.
C'est parce que personne
ne veut stopper la dégringolade.
La justice ne rapporte
plus rien à personne.
Ces deux gosses...
L'un d'eux n'avait que 18 mois.
Le déjeuner !
J'ai un conflit éthique.
D'un côté, je suis pas un mouchard.
De l'autre, j'arrête pas de penser
à ces gosses à qui on a ôté la vie.
Si c'était mes gosses, je voudrais
que quelqu'un parle pour eux.
Il faut être sûr. Tu l'es ?
Tu es sûr qu'il les a assassinés ?
Oui.
Je ne fréquente pas beaucoup Coyle.
Il a pas l'air d'être un type très honnête.
Un m'as-tu-vu, un vantard, oui.
Le genre à s'attribuer
des mérites qu'il n'a pas.
Comme Jiggy Walker. Tu t'en souviens ?
Qu'est-ce que je dois faire ?
Parle-lui.
Fais-le raconter toute l'histoire.
- Et si je pense qu'il dit la vérité ?
- C'est là que ça se complique.
Tu dois le convaincre d'avouer.
Je niquais la bonne femme, vous voyez ?
Sa gorge faisait des bulles,
y avait le bébé qui criait
dans son berceau.
J'ai été obligé de me retirer de la meuf,
y avait du sang partout, vraiment partout.
Je me suis penché sur ce merdeux...
Poignardé en plein cœur.
Bon sang ! T'es dégueulasse !
Tu devrais te dénoncer.
Non, réfléchis.
Tu serais célèbre.
Ton nom dans le journal, ta photo à la télé.
Comme Manson.
Ouais, et direct au couloir de la mort.
- Non merci, mon pote.
- Tu racontes que des conneries.
Tu me crois pas ?
Y avait un renoi là-haut,
il s'appelait comment, Jiggy Walker ?
Une grande gueule. Il est arrivé en disant
qu'il vendait de la drogue au gouverneur.
La totale, plus menteur tu meurs.
Et regarde-toi.
Va te faire foutre, et Jiggy aussi.
Je m'en fous. Je mens pas.
Si tu mens pas, prouve-le, c'est tout.
- J'ai une preuve.
- D'accord.
J'ai une cassette.
Arrête ton char.
Tu te rappelles mon pote Franklin,
de Polo Ground ?
Il est venu avec moi
et il a tout filmé en vidéo.
- Espèce de dégueulasse.
- Je fais rien à moitié.
Bon sang !
Je voudrais bien voir cette cassette.
- Moi aussi.
- Bon sang.
- J'aimerais voir ça.
- T'as vraiment ta place ici, enfoiré.
On ne peut pas passer de marché.
- Tu n'as rien à y gagner.
- Il le sait.
Coyle niera tout.
C'est sa parole contre la tienne.
- Un des ses amis a une cassette.
- Bon Dieu !
J'appellerai le procureur.
T'as des couilles, de faire ça.
J'espère les garder,
si vous voyez ce que je veux dire.
Bon sang.
Napoléon a conquis un tas d'endroits,
créé un tas de lois encore en vigueur
et laissé sa marque sur l'histoire.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a gagné ?
On a donné son nom à un dessert.
Il y a le bœuf Wellington,
la salade César.
Et Napoléon ? Sur le plateau à desserts
à côté de la crème brûlée.
<i>Au nom des 8 détenus
qui sont morts et des 20 blessés,</i>
<i>j'intente des poursuites
contre le gouverneur,</i>
<i>le ministère de la Justice
et le Centre de détention d'État d'Oswald.</i>
Ouais, enfoiré !
<i>L'administration a fait preuve
d'abus de pouvoir</i>
<i>et a violé les droits civiques
de mon client.</i>
<i>Nous exigeons donc 45 millions de dollars
de dommages et intérêts.</i>
<i>Rick Donn, Channel 2 News,
en direct du tribunal fédéral.</i>
- Le fantôme de Scott Ross me hante.
- Personne ne sait que tu l'as tué.
Mais en cas de procès,
ils vont remuer la merde.
- Cette fois, ils risquent de l'apprendre.
- L'État négociera peut-être.
- Pas Devlin. Ça serait reconnaître ses torts.
- Il faut peut-être dire la vérité.
Tim, si on sait que j'ai tué Scott Ross,
j'irai en prison.
Peut-être.
Oui, peut-être.
Grâce aux circonstances atténuantes,
ma fille de 10 ans, ma mère mourante...
Ils peuvent se contenter de me virer.
Et toi avec, pour avoir menti.
Est-ce qu'on veut prendre ce risque ?
Respect.
- Tu le sens ?
- Oui.
- Tout le monde est remonté.
- Le dîner !
- Allons manger.
- En fait, je ne peux pas. J'ai une visite.
Qui, l'avocat ?
Tricia Ross.
Encore ? Elle a déjà accepté
de les poursuivre.
- Tu as besoin de la revoir ?
- Elle a demandé un guide spirituel.
Envoie-la à un prêtre.
Imam Said,
avec tout le respect que je te dois,
Schillinger raconte partout
que la fille te plaît.
Si tu la revois,
tu n'as pas peur que ce soit mal interprété ?
Peu importe.
Je sais que mon cœur est pur.
- Ça veut dire quoi ?
- C'est une façon de saluer.
Vous savez, depuis l'annonce,
je suis devenue une célébrité.
Oui. Partout où je vais,
à l'institut de beauté, au supermarché,
les gens que je connais
m'ont vue aux infos.
J'ai quelque chose pour vous
quelque part par là.
Je voulais vous donner ça.
Je ne peux pas l'accepter.
Non, on n'a pas droit aux objets personnels,
à la cité d'émeraude.
Vous pourriez peut-être
la cacher sous votre oreiller.
<i>"Dis aux croyants</i>
"de baisser leur regard
et de garder leur chasteté.
"C'est plus pur pour eux.
"Allah est, certes,
"Parfaitement Connaisseur
de ce qu'ils font."
Le désir sexuel est un élément puissant
de la nature humaine.
J'ai raison, Imam ?
Oui.
Le moindre encouragement
suffit à enflammer ces désirs.
J'ai raison ?
Oui.
L'Islam nous apprend
que supprimer la tentation
est plus efficace qu'essayer d'y résister.
Oui.
<i>C'est pourquoi les hommes et les femmes
non mariés, ou mahrem,</i>
n'ont pas le droit d'avoir de contacts
ni d'être seuls ensemble.
J'ai raison ?
Oui, Arif.
Tu as raison.
<i>Nous, musulmans,
croyons que les appétits de la chair,</i>
<i>nourriture, boisson, sexe,</i>
peuvent nous rendre dépendants,
ou préoccupés par nos désirs physiques.
C'est pourquoi nous jeûnons,
nous déniant ces besoins
tout en renforçant notre spiritualité.
Si tu me demandes l'autorisation de jeûner,
Ça m'est égal.
- Arrête de manger.
- C'est plus compliqué que ça.
Selon les révélations du Prophète,
loué soit Son nom,
je ne suis autorisé à m'abstenir
que pendant le jour.
Au crépuscule, je dois briser le jeûne.
Je dois aussi manger avant l'aube,
avant de reprendre le jeûne.
Mais au crépuscule et à l'aube,
tu es en cellule.
Exactement.
J'ai donc besoin de votre autorisation
pour manger dans ma cellule.
C'est pas Mac Do ici.
C'est pas comme on veut quand on veut.
Tu ne mérites pas de traitement de faveur.
- Bien sûr.
- Mais je suis prêt à faire un marché.
- Laisse tomber les poursuites.
- Je ne suis pas le seul impliqué.
Je ne peux pas.
Arrête. Tu as monté tout ça.
Tu les as convaincus de poursuivre.
Convaincs-les du contraire.
Qu'est-ce que ça peut vous faire ?
Vous n'êtes même pas cité comme accusé.
Je veux en finir avec cette émeute.
On ne doit jamais permettre à personne
d'oublier ces trois jours.
En ce moment, on est
sur le point d'oublier.
On est au bord du désastre.
Avant de tous nous donner la main
pour sauter,
je veux une autre chance. Attends.
Je ne vous permettrai pas
d'oublier votre promesse.
Je n'ai pas oublié.
Vous m'autorisez donc
à jeûner selon les préceptes de ma foi ?
Non.
Me dénier le droit de pratiquer ma religion
est inconstitutionnel.
Ah oui ? Et alors ?
Tu vas intenter d'autres poursuites ?
Non.
Vous m'interdisez de jeûner ?
Je ferai la grève de la faim.
Tu avais raison, pour Tim McManus.
Il est séduisant.
Je ne me souviens pas avoir dit ça.
- On sort ensemble.
- Ah oui ?
Laisse-moi deviner. D'abord,
il t'a invitée au resto Chez Al, à Chisholm.
Il t'a dit que son père
avait un resto près d'Attica,
que vivre près de la prison
avait changé sa vie.
Deuxième rancard, annulé : trop de boulot.
Puis il t'a emmenée à Ma Plume Blanche,
en haut de la tour.
Vous avez regardé ensemble
les scintillements de la ville.
Il t'a dit qu'il te trouvait sympa.
Puis vous êtes rentrés chez lui
et vous avez baisé.
En fait, on a baisé après Chez Al.
- Quand on parle du loup...
- Diane, je peux te parler en privé ?
Pourquoi tu fais cette tête ?
Je viens d'avoir l'hôpital.
Ils ont essayé de te joindre
toute la journée.
Ta mère est morte.
Désolé.
Ça va. Elle était malade depuis longtemps.
On s'y attendait, tu le sais.
Oh mon Dieu !
Je peux faire quelque chose ?
Non, il faut que j'aille à l'hôpital
m'occuper des obsèques.
Tu peux me faire remplacer ?
- C'est déjà fait.
- Merci.
- Je t'y amène ?
- J'ai ma voiture, j'irai chercher ma fille.
- Je peux le faire.
- Non,
sa place est avec moi.
Je veux lui annoncer la nouvelle moi-même.
Napoléon a séduit beaucoup
de belles femmes plus grandes que lui.
Il a dit : "En guerre comme en amour,
"pour en finir, il faut se voir de près."
On ne peut pas se voir
de plus près qu'à Oz.
Salut.
Salut.
- Tu as eu Diane ?
- Oui, elle vient d'appeler.
Comment elle va ?
Qu'est-ce que tu crois ? Mal.
Bizarre, vu que sa mère
est mourante depuis quoi, un an ?
Je nous ai trouvé un resto super.
- Rubiletta. Un nouvel italien.
- Je vais devoir annuler.
J'ai promis à Diane
de passer aux pompes funèbres.
D'accord.
Tu m'as dit que c'était fini entre vous.
C'est fini. On est amis.
On ne dirait pas.
Aujourd'hui, dans la salle de repos...
Sa mère venait de mourir.
J'ai vu comment tu la tenais.
C'était plus que du réconfort.
Ne te moque pas de moi !
Claire, de quoi tu parles, bordel ?
- De toi et Diane, de toi et moi.
- Il n'y a pas de moi et Diane.
Et pour être tout à fait honnête,
de toi et moi non plus.
- On s'est vus 2 fois !
- On a baisé 2 fois !
- Et alors ?
- Tu m'as dit que tu me trouvais sympa.
Oui, mais si tu dois devenir
un pot de colle...
Je suis un putain de pot de colle, hein ?
Et eux, c'est des putains de...
- Calme-toi !
- Lâche-moi.
- Arrête !
- Lâche-moi !
Lâche-moi !
- Tu vas te calmer ?
- Lâche-moi.
Laisse-moi !
- Tu vas te faire virer.
- Je t'emmerde !
- Oui, vous désirez ?
- On vient voir mon fils, Carlo Ricardo.
D'accord. Allez au bureau des entrées.
Où est maman ?
C'est pas encore la grippe, si ?
Non, elle est à la chorale.
Tu sais ce que pense le père Annas
si on manque les répétitions.
Tu fais partie de la chorale.
J'ai arrêté.
J'ai pas le temps avec le bébé, tout ça.
Sergio ?
Il bosse.
Sergio ne veut plus venir, fiston.
Maman ?
Je ne vais pas te mentir.
Elle ne veut pas te voir comme ça.
Je comprends.
Ça veut pas dire qu'elle ne t'aime pas.
Je comprends.
Isabella, tu as des photos du bébé ?
Alors, Cohn m'a dit,
son surin maison à la main :
"Je le lui ai collé dans le crâne,
mais je l'ai pas tué."
Il vous est arrivé d'avoir peur ?
Si ça m'est arrivé ? Tout le temps.
Même si je ne suis plus
sur le terrain avec vous tous et toutes,
je dis une prière tout bas chaque fois
que je passe ces putains de grilles.
Je rentre. Si je suis encore en retard,
ma femme va me botter le cul.
Merci pour le verre, monsieur.
- Bonsoir.
- Conduisez prudemment.
- Oui, Clayton ?
- Je devrais te raccompagner.
- Tu veux dire que j'ai bu un verre de trop ?
- Deux.
Je veux aussi te parler d'un truc
et comme tu es un peu gai,
c'est ma chance.
Tu vas te plaindre ? Tu débutes.
Non, le salaire est parfait.
Mais c'est le hall.
Je n'ai pas fait une formation
pour rester derrière un bureau.
- Je veux être affecté à un quartier.
- Non.
Je t'ai dit quoi quand tu as postulé ?
J'ai promis à ton père mourant
de veiller sur toi.
Je ne te laisserai pas
approcher les prisonniers.
Alors, je démissionne.
J'irai bosser dans une autre prison,
où je pourrai m'occuper des détenus.
Tu veux prouver quoi ?
Que tu es un dur, comme ton père ?
Il est mort ici,
il s'est vidé de son sang dans mes bras.
- Je ne veux pas revivre ça avec toi.
- Je n'ai plus 10 ans, Léo.
Tu ne peux pas m'en empêcher.
On verra ça demain, d'accord ?
Donne-moi les clés.
Non, je peux conduire.
Cette conversation m'a dessoûlé.
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ? Arrêtez !
Tu fais plus le malin, hein ?
- Allez.
- Recule.
C'est qui le chef, maintenant ?
Allez vous faire voir !
C'est qui, hein ?
Emmenez-le au mitard.
Ça va ?
- Va te faire examiner à l'hôpital.
- Ça va.
- C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
- Ce sale Latino est dingue.
Il marmonnait des trucs sur sa mère.
Tu veux ma photo ?
Napoléon a fini
par être vaincu à Waterloo.
Ça a dû être embarrassant.
T'es le putain d'empereur.
T'as conquis l'Europe
pour perdre dans un endroit
au nom aussi stupide que Waterloo,
Watergate ou Whitewater.
Avis aux politiciens :
évitez les noms en "water".
<i>Depuis qu'on a réinstauré
la peine de mort, Larry,</i>
<i>les tribunaux croulent
sous les appels inutiles</i>
<i>de meurtriers condamnés
tentant d'échapper à leur juste peine.</i>
<i>Le corps législatif a donc accepté</i>
<i>la baisse du traitement des avocats commis
d'office dans les affaires de meurtre.</i>
<i>Certains de ces avocats,
qui sont opposés à la peine capitale,</i>
<i>ont gonflé leur note pour exprimer ceci :</i>
<i>"Vous voyez, c'est trop cher."</i>
<i>Qu'ils aillent profiter ailleurs
de l'argent des contribuables.</i>
La cour a rejeté notre appel.
Et quelle est l'étape suivante ?
Normalement, l'étape suivante,
l'ultime étape,
c'est la Cour suprême d'État.
Allons-y.
Qu'y a-t-il, Lawrence ?
Je me récuse moi-même en tant qu'avocat.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi ? J'ai dit
ou fait quelque chose ?
Pas du tout.
Mais avec la baisse
des honoraires payés par l'État,
je ne peux pas me permettre
de vous défendre.
Les affaires de meurtre
prennent beaucoup de temps
et j'ai négligé mes autres clients.
- Que va-t-il m'arriver, alors ?
- La cour nommera un autre avocat.
Qui ne sera pas aussi bon.
Ceux qui acceptent de travailler
pour moins cher
- sont ceux dont personne d'autre ne veut.
- Désolé.
- Ouah !
- Qu'y a-t-il, Shirley ?
Ça me frappe pour la première fois.
Je vais mourir.
- Salut, papa.
- J'ai de mauvaises nouvelles, Vern.
T'en as jamais de bonnes.
- Andy a été arrêté.
- Bon Dieu ! Pour quoi ?
J'en sais rien.
La drogue, un renoi passé à tabac.
- L'avocat essaie de démêler ça.
- Quel avocat ? Ne prends pas Zanger.
Non, l'avocat commis d'office.
Quoi, un commis d'office ?
Prends un vrai avocat, bordel !
J'ai pas les moyens.
Je lui ai parlé au téléphone.
Elle a l'air bien.
Elle ?
- Elle s'appelle comment ?
- J'en sais rien. Goldberg, je crois.
Bon Dieu de merde, papa.
Il faut que tu t'en occupes.
Qu'est-ce que je fous, à ton avis ?
Et je vais te dire, je gaspillerai
pas de fric pour des voyous.
Et c'est ce que vous êtes, tous les deux.
Les chiens font pas des chats.
Tu voulais me voir ?
Faut me sortir d'ici.
On ne te protège pas sans raison.
On veut que tu restes en vie
pour témoigner contre Schillinger.
Si je reste ici, je vais mourir d'ennui.
Tu voulais des magazines pornos,
je t'en ai envoyé.
Combien de fois par jour
on peut se branler ?
- Je ne sais pas. Ça dépend des gars.
- Je veux retourner à la cité d'émeraude.
Je m'en fais pas pour Schillinger.
Je me débrouillerai tout seul.
Je veux que cet enfoiré
voie que je me dégonfle pas.
- C'est quoi, son soutif, bordel ?
- Salut, Keller. Déjà de retour ?
Y a pas de chochotte
en détention protectrice.
Non.
Tu sais qu'on s'est embrassés qu'une fois ?
Pendant tous ces mois, une seule fois.
Je rêve de recommencer.
Non, je t'ai dit.
J'ai fait ce que tu m'as demandé.
J'ai dénoncé Schillinger et Metzger.
Tu sais ce que ça veut dire ?
Toby, tu sais ce que ça m'a coûté ?
À moins que ce soit juste un autre plan
mijoté avec Schillinger.
Comment te faire confiance ?
Je devrais me remettre
dans cette situation ?
Être de nouveau aussi vulnérable ?
Keller sait que s'il déconne, il est mort.
Si t'es là, enfoiré, amène-toi, allez.
Il me faut ce plasma tout de suite.
On va commencer une I.V. Je veux
du tulle gras et des pansements absorbants.
Bon Dieu.
Il pourrait bien avoir un poumon perforé.
Maintenant, M. Keller
a trois ou quatre trous de balle.
Tu as demandé à être
réaffecté à la cuisine.
Et maintenant, tu me dis
que tu ne veux plus y travailler ?
Trop de mauvais souvenirs,
de ressentiments.
Nappa, Wangler...
Ils n'ont pas confiance en moi.
Ni moi en eux.
Je ne veux pas retomber
dans mes vieilles habitudes.
L'atelier de confection
cherche toujours des ouvriers.
Non.
Si je peux,
je voudrais travailler avec les sidéens.
On n'a pas beaucoup de volontaires
pour y aller.
En Afrique, le sida est bien pire qu'ici.
Je voudrais apprendre
des trucs sur la maladie
pour un jour peut-être,
pouvoir aider les miens.
Ces hommes sont en phase terminale.
On peut juste leur apporter du confort
et les traiter avec dignité.
Robbie Garth doit prendre ses médicaments,
lit numéro 7.
- Tu es qui ?
- Adebisi. Prends ça.
Délicieux.
Je n'avais pas le sida en arrivant à Oz.
Je l'ai chopé en prime.
T'as déjà enculé quelqu'un ?
- Oui.
- Tu t'étais protégé ?
Non.
Le Dr Nathan m'a dit
de te faire une autre prise de sang.
- Elle vient de m'en faire une.
- Elle lui a échappé des mains.
Adebisi, tu m'as pincé ?
Non, patron.
L'histoire nous apprend
que Napoléon a été le premier à dire :
"On ne fait bien
que ce qu'on fait soi-même."
Mais comment en être sûr ?
Son boucher a pu le lui dire
en tranchant du salami
et Napoléon, qui n'était pas un imbécile,
penser : "Je vais noter ça."
Miguel Alvarez est de plus en plus agité
- depuis que Garvey lui a arrêté le Prozac.
- Ce n'est pas étonnant.
Et je n'en suis pas sûre,
mais je le trouve amaigri.
Je doute que ce soit
en réaction au sevrage.
Le Dr Garvey ne pourrait pas changer d'avis
et remettre Alvarez sous antidépresseurs ?
Non. C'est pas un médecin,
mais un livre de comptes ambulant.
Toutes ses décisions visent à faire faire
des économies à l'organisme de soins.
Je le vois dans quelques minutes,
il va décider si je dois ou pas
continuer à faire partie du personnel.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Qu'il est peut-être temps
pour moi de partir.
- Dr Nathan, Rebadow est réveillé.
- Merci.
Qu'a Rebadow ?
Choc insulinique. Il est diabétique.
Diabétique ?
- Je ne suis pas diabétique.
- Maintenant, si.
Ça peut arriver, en vieillissant.
Le corps commence à gripper.
Piqûres régulières, dialyse hebdomadaire
et modification de votre alimentation.
Les caramels de maman.
Elle fait les meilleurs caramels du monde.
Elle m'en envoie tous les mois.
Il faudra vous contenter
de ce qu'on vous sert à la cafétéria.
Voyons,
vous travaillez à Oswald
depuis presque deux ans.
Ça vous plaît ?
Si vous voulez savoir si je m'amuse,
la réponse est non.
- Alors pourquoi vouloir rester ?
- Ce qu'on fait ici est important.
Il y a un vrai besoin
de soins médicaux corrects.
Oui, corrects. Pas excessifs.
Je sais que vous êtes opposée
à la privatisation du système à Oz.
Mais en payant un forfait
aux assurances Weigert,
quels que soient les soins nécessaires,
l'État réduit ses frais.
Mais comme Weigert reçoit la même somme
quel que soit le traitement prescrit,
Ça limite le recours aux spécialistes
et aux examens coûteux.
C'est pareil avec
les organismes de soins du secteur public.
Il y a une différence.
Des lois protègent les consommateurs
des réductions des dépenses de soins.
Il n'y en a pas pour les détenus.
Rien n'incite Weigert
à fournir des soins de qualité.
Nous sommes médecins tous les deux.
Nous avons prêté le même serment.
Pourquoi supprimer
les antidépresseurs à Miguel Alvarez ?
Parce que pour moi,
il s'agit de soins inutiles.
Et si vous n'aviez pas trop dépensé
en soins inutiles,
l'État n'aurait pas eu besoin
de faire appel à nous.
- Alvarez est suicidaire.
- C'est peut-être un bien.
Quoi ?
Dieu sait que, vivant,
il ne fait de bien à personne.
Je vous emmerde.
Cet entretien est terminé. Votre préavis
de 15 jours commence tout de suite.
Allez vous faire foutre, connard.
Bonjour.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Rien.
J'ai l'air particulièrement crédule,
aujourd'hui ?
Tu caches un sandwich sous ton surplis,
que tu ne portes jamais
- et je suis censée trouver ça normal ?
- Je ne peux pas en parler, Pete.
Tu es tenu au secret.
Je descends au mitard.
Il y a quatre catholiques
là-bas en ce moment.
O'Brien, Bevilaqua,
Hevern...
Alvarez.
Tu lui apportes à manger ce qu'il aime
pour lui remonter le moral.
Non, tu ne serais pas tenu au secret.
Tu apportes à manger à Alvarez...
parce qu'on ne le nourrit pas.
À cause de ce qu'il a fait
au gardien Rivera,
par solidarité, les gardiens de prison
le laissent mourir de faim.
Tu aurais dû être flic.
C'est Alvarez qui te l'a dit ?
Comment sais-tu si c'est vrai ?
Pourquoi mentirait-il ?
Une fois au mitard, certains prisonniers
deviennent délirants, paranoïaques.
Comment savoir s'ils le nourrissent ?
Si je leur demande et que c'est vrai,
ils trouveront un autre moyen
de l'emmerder.
Je dois lui accorder le bénéfice du doute.
Et le surplis ? C'est le sabbat ou quoi ?
Laissez-nous seuls.
Tenez, mangez.
Je n'ai pas faim.
Comment ça, vous n'avez pas faim ?
Vous n'avez pas mangé depuis deux jours.
Prenez ce sandwich !
Je veux pas ce putain de sandwich !
Allez-vous faire foutre, enfoiré !
Allez. Dehors !
Arrêtez. Ouvrez cette porte !
Pour l'amour du ciel !
Je crois que Keller s'en sortira.
Je vais ouvrir une enquête
pour essayer de savoir qui l'a poignardé.
J'ai ma petite idée. Schillinger.
- Il nous faut une preuve.
- Excuse-moi, Léo.
Il faut faire plus que ça.
Il faut s'occuper de la violence quotidienne
qui règne entre les détenus
- et entre les détenus et le personnel.
- Bonne chance.
Attendez.
Pourquoi ne pas lancer un programme
où les victimes de la violence,
prisonniers ou personnel,
dialogueraient avec leurs agresseurs.
- Désolé d'être en retard.
- Dialoguer ? Ça fait un peu New Age.
Écoutez jusqu'au bout.
La procédure doit être lancée par la victime.
On ne peut pas obliger une des parties
à participer si elle est contre.
Si les deux parties sont d'accord,
je les rencontre séparément
pour parler de ce qu'elles pourraient retirer
de ce dialogue éventuel.
À ce moment-là seulement,
quand elles sont prêtes,
elles se rencontrent vraiment.
Et là, elles parlent de leur ressenti ?
Oui, la victime exprime sa peur,
sa colère ou autre.
Et l'agresseur peut exprimer son remords
ou autre.
Et avec un peu de chance,
ils peuvent avancer.
C'est une excellente idée.
J'aimerais l'avoir eue moi-même.
Quoi, Alvarez ?
Léo, je veux que le nouveau programme
de sœur Pete commence
avec Eugène Rivera et Miguel Alvarez.
Vraiment ?
Elle parlera à Alvarez
puis contactera Rivera
pour voir s'il est intéressé. S'il l'est,
je veux que tu sortes Miguel du mitard.
Je sais ce qui s'est passé aujourd'hui.
Je pensais que ça t'aurait convaincu
qu'Alvarez était bien là où il était.
Et ça ne plairait pas aux autres gardiens.
- N'en tiens pas compte.
- Je suis d'accord avec eux.
Alvarez a rendu un collègue aveugle.
Qu'il pourrisse.
Son prochain acte de violence
sera contre lui-même.
Il est à deux doigts de se suicider.
Qu'il le fasse.
Je sais qu'entre Miguel et toi,
il y a eu des moments durs,
après le viol de ta fille.
Il sait qui l'a fait
et il refuse de parler.
Je croyais que tu avais dépassé ça.
Moi aussi.
On avait tort tous les deux.
<i>Quand Napoléon est mort en exil,
les médecins lui ont coupé la bite.</i>
<i>Ils l'ont mise dans une jolie boîte
et l'ont donnée à son prêtre.</i>
<i>Ne me demandez pas pourquoi.</i>
<i>Au fil des ans, la bite de Napoléon
a été vendue plusieurs fois au plus offrant.</i>
À ce jour, trois personnes au moins
prétendent posséder la bite de Napoléon.
Mais peu importe qui l'a vraiment.
La grande question, c'est :
À qui diable étaient
les deux autres bites ?
Avant, je courais.
Je faisais pas des marathons, je courais.
Les marathons, c'est de la connerie.
Rien qu'une mode.
Un mec derrière un bureau choisit un jour
et qu'il pleuve ou qu'il vente,
on martèle le bitume
au milieu de 50000 autres connards.
Non, y a des trucs
qu'il vaut mieux faire tout seul.
O'Brien.
Bevilaqua.
Alvarez.
Et merde !
Alvarez, tu m'entends ?
Je vous avais dit que ça arriverait !
Oui, tu es très maline.
Tu vas nous manquer quand tu seras partie.
La question est de savoir
si Alvarez va vivre.
- Oui.
- Alors, détendons-nous.
Se détendre ?
Léo, c'est pas parce
qu'Alvarez va s'en tirer
qu'on aura autant de chance
la prochaine fois.
Dr Garvey, le prochain détenu
que vous privez de traitement,
simplement parce que c'est trop coûteux,
peut en mourir.
La Weigert Corporation
a été sollicitée pour fournir des traitements
au système pénitentiaire de l'État
en vue d'en limiter les coûts.
Mon boulot est de prendre des décisions.
D'après le marché conclu
entre Weigert et le gouverneur,
je peux agir en parfaite autonomie.
Et je ne laisserai jamais quiconque
remettre cette autonomie en question.
Eh bien...
C'est n'importe quoi, Léo.
Il a raison. Je n'ai
aucune autorité sur lui.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait, alors ?
On alerte la presse.
Si je peux encore vous être utile,
n'hésitez pas.
- Très bien.
- Merci.
Qui est-ce ?
<i>Rick Donn, de Channel 2 News.
Il veut vous interviewer au sujet d'Alvarez.</i>
- Vous ne lui avez rien révélé sur...
- Si.
Comme je suis renvoyée,
je n'ai rien à perdre.
Je leur dirai que vous n'êtes
qu'une employée contrariée.
Comme vous voulez.
Ils vous croiront peut-être,
tout ça sera peut-être oublié.
Mais quand je serai partie,
à la prochaine bavure,
si la personne meurt, vous n'aurez personne
à qui faire porter le chapeau.
À votre place, je mettrais une cravate rouge.
Ça passe mieux à la télé.
Bonjour. Il est là ?
C'est une urgence.
Entrez.
Dr Nathan.
Gloria, j'ai un problème.
Cette situation
avec le détenu Miguel Alvarez.
Rick Donn m'a appelé
pour solliciter une interview,
il veut savoir ce que je pense de Weigert.
Ensuite, j'ai eu un appel de Ross Tavoli,
le patron de Medmore,
une filiale de Weigert.
Ross est un vieil ami.
Un ami très généreux.
- M. Le gouverneur...
- Vous n'êtes pas déjà passée à la télé ?
- Non.
- Bien. Voilà ce que je propose.
Vous gardez votre poste,
Alvarez reprend son traitement,
et Weigert accepte de desserrer
les cordons de la bourse.
Et Garvey ?
Il est parti.
Il pratiquait l'avortement illégal
dans les années'70.
Une femme qu'il opérait
est morte sur le billard.
Il s'est installé ici
et a recouvré légalement sa licence.
Ne me demandez pas comment.
En tout cas, je suis sûr que Rick Donn
sera amplement satisfait de ce scoop
et laissera toute cette histoire
tomber dans l'oubli.
On me dit
que vous êtes quelqu'un de raisonnable.
Soyez raisonnable. Coopérez.
Je veux rester,
mais je veux être sûre
que les choses vont vraiment changer.
Vous avez ma parole.
<i>Garvey a démissionné aujourd'hui,
en pleine polémique.</i>
<i>Le gouverneur Devlin dit qu'il engageait
la responsabilité de la Weigert Corporation.</i>
<i>Un porte-parole de Weigert
a déclaré ignorer le passé de Garvey</i>
<i>et a promis de réévaluer
la politique de la firme</i>
<i>dans les centres pénitentiaires du pays.</i>
Miguel ?
Je suis mort ?
Je suis au paradis ?
Pas tout à fait.
Merde.
Fallait me laisser mourir.
<i>Matricule 99S233,</i>
<i>Nikolaï Stanislofsky.</i>
<i>Condamné le 14 février 1999.</i>
<i>Recel d'objets volés
avec intention de les vendre.</i>
Une peine de 15 ans.
Liberté conditionnelle dans 5 ans.
- T'es russe ?
- Oui.
- De Russie ?
- Oui.
- T'es né en Russie ?
- Oui.
- C'est ta première fois à Oz ?
- La seule.
Tu t'y feras.
J'ai fait sept ans de goulag soviétique.
Ici, c'est du gâteau.
C'est qui, cette fille ?
Mlle Sally.
Regarde ces nibards, putain.
On est proches du couloir de la mort ?
Ouais, pourquoi ?
Tu connais quelqu'un là-bas ?
Un mec que je connaissais...
Alexander Vogel s'est fait descendre.
Je voudrais serrer la main
du mec qui l'a tué.
C'est Richie Hanlon.
Richie Hanlon.
Richie.
Chéri ? Sors ton bras s'il te plaît.
Pour le pull.
Quatre barreaux, ça te va ?
Trois.
Le courrier !
Ça faisait longtemps, Vern.
- Je t'ai manqué ?
- À en perdre haleine.
J'ai la théière que t'as commandée.
Merci, mon chou.
C'est devenu un vrai petit nid, ici.
Mon nouvel avocat
a fait appel à la Cour suprême.
- J'en ai encore pour un moment.
- C'est une bonne nouvelle.
Ouais.
Salut, Richie. Rien pour toi aujourd'hui.
Tes petits copains pédés
doivent être occupés à se faire épiler.
- Ta gueule, "Schillinjer".
- "Schillinger", connard.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé
entre toi et Vern ?
Chaque fois qu'il vient,
vous montrez les dents.
C'est une longue histoire.
Je n'ai pas d'autres rendez-vous
aujourd'hui.
C'est à cause de ce salaud
que je suis condamné à mort.
Lui et un autre saligaud d'Aryen
ont tué un Russe.
Ils l'ont pendu par les chevilles
dans le gymnase
et ont écrit "Juif"
au couteau sur son torse.
JUIF
Ensuite ils m'ont dit que si je n'avouais pas
le meurtre, ils me tueraient.
Condamné à mort dans les deux cas.
Si tu sais que tu vas mourir,
pourquoi tu dis pas la vérité ?
L'autre, Mark Mack, est déjà mort.
En plus, pourquoi les matons
me croiraient maintenant ?
Si je dis que c'est Schillinger,
ils voudront des preuves.
- J'ai pas de preuve.
- Sauf si vous l'avez fait ensemble.
- Quoi ?
- Mens.
Dis-leur que toi et Vern
avez tué le Russe ensemble.
- En quoi ça m'arrange ?
- Ça t'arrange pas, chéri.
Mais au moins, ses miches se retrouveront
dans la cellule d'à côté.
Penses-y, Richie.
Coyle, ça va ? T'es à l'aise ?
Ça t'intéresse ?
Pourquoi t'as dit à Hill
que t'avais tué la famille ?
Pourquoi t'as pas fermé ta grande gueule ?
Demande-moi pourquoi Frankie m'a filmé
pendant que je le faisais.
Demande-moi même pourquoi je l'ai fait.
Si tu piges pas ça,
t'as rien à foutre ici, McManus.
Bon, j'ai rien à foutre ici.
- Pourquoi tu l'as dit à Hill ?
- Hill.
Il est pas comme les autres renois d'ici.
- Je voulais qu'il me respecte.
- Respecte.
Maintenant, je veux qu'il crève.
T'es content, McManus ?
T'as tout ce que tu voulais ?
Je voulais qu'il me respecte
et maintenant, qu'il crève.
Entre l'amour et la haine, y a qu'un pas.
Tu piges, McManus ? Connard !
<i>Sur Channel 2 News,
les preuves choquantes</i>
<i>fournies lors du procès
contre le suspect Malcolm Coyle.</i>
<i>Une cassette vidéo horrible du meurtre
des membres de la famille Ciancimino.</i>
Bon sang. Pourquoi ils montrent ça ?
Fais pas ta meuf, O'Reily.
Je fais pas la meuf,
mais pourquoi montrer ça à la télé ?
C'est des preuves contre Coyle.
Des preuves.
Y a qu'à les montrer au tribunal,
pas aux infos régionales.
Ça te plairait d'arriver chez toi,
d'allumer la télé,
et de voir les tripes de ta grand-mère
étalées devant tout le monde ?
<i>Je veux voir La classe de Mlle Sally.</i>
- Ouais, Mlle Sally, elle a des gros nénés.
- Gros nénés.
Du calme, Cyril.
Faut la frapper là.
- Ils ont mis Hill sous protection.
- C'est pas ça qui sauvera cette balance.
Il va payer pour ce qu'il a fait à Snake.
<i>Le jury m'a fait tourner en bourrique.</i>
T'étais super.
En plus, ils ont vu la vidéo.
Coyle sera inculpé et condamné.
Tu sais ce que je préfère dans tout ça ?
C'est d'être dehors. D'aller en ville.
L'énergie, les gonzesses.
La ville a deux nouveaux gratte-ciels.
Mais surtout, la sensation de liberté.
D'être loin du danger.
Wangler et les autres,
ils vont me descendre.
Je leur en veux pas.
Je suis pas sûr que c'était une bonne idée
de balancer Coyle.
Ils sont morts, de toute façon.
Le procès va pas les ramener.
En attendant, je suis dans la merde.
On va s'occuper de toi.
Ça va ?
Ouais. J'ai la grippe.
Continue ce que tu disais sur Hill.
Personne n'aime les mouchards.
C'est vrai, mais on va laisser ça de côté
pour l'instant.
Je vais faire appel à votre conscience.
Vous avez tous commis des meurtres,
mais dans le cadre du travail.
C'est vrai, c'est différent.
Vous avez tous une famille.
Le meurtre de cette famille innocente
menace votre famille à l'extérieur.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, Said ?
Aidez-moi à protéger Hill.
Tous ensemble.
On fait comprendre à Wangler
qu'on ne tolérera aucun mal contre lui.
Je connais un peu la famille Ciancimino.
Des braves gens. Ils ont jamais fait de mal.
Et le père est mort chez les Viets.
Tu peux compter sur la fraternité.
Et toi ?
Ouais.
Nappa ?
Non seulement on ne touchera pas à Hill,
mais je vais faire encore mieux.
Nappa a descendu Snake.
Faut descendre Nappa.
Ce salaud de mouchard,
ce renoi en fauteuil, Hill,
lui aussi, faut l'exploser.
Du calme. On peut pas
les faire chier pour l'instant.
Y a les putains de Siciliens,
les musulmans, ces enculés d'Aryens,
et les Latinos
qui nous cassent les couilles.
Alors on fait quoi ?
On les laisse nous manquer de respect ?
Le respect ? On s'en fout.
Faut attendre le bon moment,
et là on les plante comme il faut.
- T'as entendu ?
- Compris.
Bon, Ricardo,
tu vas bien te tenir à présent ?
- Où est Isabella ?
- Elle s'occupe du bébé.
Elle croit qu'il couve la grippe.
La grippe, c'est ça.
Papa, t'as dit
que tu ne me mentirais jamais.
Le bébé était malade.
Rien de grave.
Juan lui a dit de rester chez elle.
Le salaud n'a jamais pu me sacquer.
- J'ai baisé sa cousine au mariage.
- T'as baisé sa cousine ?
Elle me suçait dans les chiottes.
Juan a déboulé.
- Ils s'engueulent beaucoup.
- Je lui ai dit de pas l'épouser.
Parce qu'elle vient ici.
Elle a dit qu'elle ne viendrait plus
pour l'instant.
Elle ne veut pas finir
divorcée avec un bébé.
Alors, je l'emmerde.
Non, je les emmerde,
elle et son connard de mari.
Non, papa. Pour eux, je suis mort.
Elle est morte pour moi.
Dis à cette salope qu'elle est morte
et que je ne veux plus jamais entendre
son nom, putain !
"Le mur."
C'est comme ça qu'ils appellent ça.
Le moment où on n'en peut plus,
où on s'est poussé à bout,
où on a forcé tous les muscles.
Un pas de plus
et le corps va imploser.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- Parfois la prière a du bon.
Quand tu es malheureux,
demande l'aide de Dieu.
On peut prier ensemble.
Prie pour que je te laisse la vie sauve.
- Lâche le couteau !
- T'as qu'à venir le chercher !
J'ai un Code 19.
Donne-moi ça !
T'as pas de couilles, putain !
Tu écris des poèmes ?
- C'est fini, ces conneries.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que j'ai pas envie, pigé ?
J'ai pas envie, c'est tout.
Dommage. T'écrivais bien.
Adebisi, fiche-moi la paix.
- Voilà, Révérend.
- Merci.
Ça fait quatre jours
que tu fais la grève de la faim.
Aucune réaction de McManus ou de Glynn.
Parce qu'ils s'imaginent
que c'est du bluff.
Mais ils verront bien que non.
T'en fais pas, mon frère.
Cette grève de la faim
ne va pas durer longtemps.
Le juge a accepté notre dépôt de plainte.
Excellent.
- Le procès commence quand ?
- Dans deux mois.
- Tant que ça ?
- La justice est lente.
À supposer qu'elle avance.
Attendez. Encore une chose.
Je veux que vous alliez voir le directeur.
Cette grève de la faim a débuté
parce que t'as refusé à Said
d'avoir à manger la nuit
pour qu'il jeûne pendant la journée.
Pas de régime particulier pour lui.
Demain, deux autres musulmans
arrêteront de manger.
Le jour d'après, trois autres,
et ainsi de suite jusqu'à ce que
tous les musulmans d'Oz,
tous les musulmans en prison dans cet État
fassent la grève de la faim.
Je ne suis pas le procureur général,
mais je pense
qu'il dirait que la dernière chose
qu'il vous faut, en plus de cette plainte,
c'est de prisons remplies
d'hommes qui meurent pour leur foi.
Mauvaise presse, mauvais karma, messieurs.
On devrait céder à Said.
Léo, si tu cèdes maintenant,
qu'est-ce qui l'empêchera de faire
la grève de la faim pour exiger autre chose ?
On verra bien.
J'espère que cette plainte sera retirée.
Si tu le laisses gagner,
il prendra de l'envergure. On y perd.
Il faut parfois savoir perdre pour gagner.
Je pige pas ces machines.
Les gens qui veulent juste courir
sur des machines.
Ouais, on perd quelques kilos,
on tonifie quelques muscles,
mais on va nulle part.
On est comme un hamster
dans son espèce de roue.
Moi ?
J'ai plus envie d'être un hamster.
Salut.
Tim, désolée pour l'autre jour...
- C'est pas...
- Attends.
J'ai réagi de façon excessive.
La mère de Diane est morte,
tu l'as réconfortée
et j'en ai fait tout un plat,
comme si tu l'aimais encore.
Je suis un putain de pot de colle, hein ?
- Lâche-moi.
- Arrête ! Calme-toi.
J'ai eu tort. Je suis bête. Je m'excuse.
Je veux juste que tout redevienne
comme avant.
Tu comprends pas
qu'il n'y avait rien entre nous ?
Désolé si je me suis fait mal comprendre,
mais tu m'as dragué avec une telle ardeur,
je pensais que tu voulais juste baiser.
Je n'ai pas envie d'une relation sérieuse.
Je suis nul quand il s'agit de m'engager,
sauf pour mon boulot.
Si je voulais être marié,
je le serais resté.
Dégage !
- Je te demande pas de m'épouser.
- Je sais.
- Juste qu'on soit amis.
- Amis, d'accord.
Le sexe restera à part.
- On ne devrait pas continuer à baiser.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que ça complique tout.
- Pas obligatoirement.
Si. Toujours.
Je te jure que non.
- Tu peux pas faire ce genre de promesse.
- Si.
- Non.
- Quoi ?
Tu trouves que je suis pas un bon coup ?
Merde !
- Claire...
- Non !
Tu sais, t'es pas si brillant non plus.
Peut-être que tu t'engages pas
parce que tu préfères sucer un de ces mecs.
J'ai mis le doigt sur quelque chose ?
- Non, tu m'ennuies.
- Enculé !
Giles.
Bevilaqua.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Viens, Howell. Jolis nichons.
Deux fois en une semaine, Léo.
Pendant sa garde.
Alvarez qui manque de se tuer,
et maintenant, ça.
- Elle est nouvelle.
- Elle est dangereuse.
Bevilaqua aura peut-être
des séquelles au cerveau.
- Je la transfère dans un autre quartier.
- Non, Léo.
Vire-la maintenant. Vire-la, putain !
Votre attention s'il vous plaît !
Messieurs.
Voici l'agent Sean Murphy,
le nouveau surveillant de la cité d'émeraude.
J'ai lu tous vos dossiers.
Je sais que vous êtes des durs.
La vie est nulle à Oz.
Je le sais aussi. Ne me forcez pas
à rendre les jours encore plus durs.
"Sean Murphy."
- Un Irlandais, comme nous.
- Et c'est bien ?
Petit frère, les choses vont s'améliorer.
- Salut, ma belle.
- Putain, je vais te crever !
Je vais te crever, Schillinger.
Je t'aurai, Schillinger !
J'aimerais une autre part, jolies miches.
Si vous m'envoyez au mitard,
Schillinger s'en prendra à mon frère.
Sniff. Fallait y penser
avant de péter les plombs.
Je m'excuse.
- Tim, je peux m'en occuper ?
- Vas-y. Il me comprend pas.
Bien, allons-y.
Bon, O'Reily, je laisse passer.
Pour cette fois.
Encore une connerie,
et je m'occupe de toi moi-même.
- Pourquoi t'es si sympa ?
- Ton dossier.
Je connais ta situation avec ton frère.
J'ai des frères. Je sais ce que c'est.
En plus, toi et moi,
on est irlandais, non ?
Tu l'as dit.
- Champion Golden Gloves.
- Comment tu sais ?
T'as lu mon dossier, moi, le tien.
Je parie que tu frappes fort.
Ouais, dans le bon vieux temps.
Mais on m'a aussi mis K. -O.
Mon frère Cyril, il est boxeur.
Je l'ai inscrit au tournoi
organisé par McManus.
Je croyais qu'il était lent.
Ouais, dans la vie.
Mais sur le ring, il fonce.
C'est comme un instinct
qui reprend le dessus.
Le problème,
c'est que j'y connais rien à la boxe.
Je me demandais
si tu voulais bien l'entraîner.
- Moi ?
- Ouais.
Impossible. Ce serait du favoritisme.
Pas directement,
mais si tu pouvais jeter un œil de loin,
et me donner des conseils.
- Au nom de l'Irlande ?
- On verra, petit.
Silence !
Taisez-vous.
Taisez-vous, qu'on puisse commencer.
C'est le premier tournoi de boxe d'Oswald.
On a éliminé la classification par poids.
Dans ce coin, en short bleu,
Chucky Pancamo l'Exécuteur.
Et ici, Steve Pasquin L'Éclair.
Battez-vous proprement.
Ni coup sous la ceinture, ni vacherie.
Obéissez à mes ordres.
Protégez-vous, allez dans votre coin,
serrez-vous la main.
La cloche.
Hé, Ryan, comment va Cyril ?
Gardien,
- faites partir ces deux connards.
- Il est susceptible.
Je venais te dire combien je me réjouis
du premier combat de Cyril,
- contre James, ici présent.
- C'est ça, Cyril et moi.
Et t'y peux foutrement rien.
Beecher t'a mordu la bite.
Tu veux qu'on s'occupe du reste ?
Avance, O'Reily.
Les paris sont pour toi à 5 contre 1.
ASSORTIMENT DE BONBONS
- Ryan.
- Tante Brenda.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as apporté ?
- Tes préférés.
Non !
- Ton entraînement.
- Un entraînement pour quoi ?
Un combat. Un match de boxe est organisé.
Non, Ryan. Tu vas pas le faire boxer.
Pourquoi ?
Il a le cerveau assez secoué.
Tu veux faire de la boxe, chéri ?
Pourquoi tu lui demandes ça ?
Parce que je sais
que tu le forces à faire ce que tu veux.
Va te faire foutre.
Non, va te faire foutre !
Alors comme ça tu te préoccupes
du sort de Cyril ?
Je m'en suis toujours préoccupée.
Je pense à vous deux.
Ah oui ? Et t'étais où
quand on était petits ?
Quand ce salaud nous tapait dessus ?
Sur maman ?
T'étais à ta putain de messe,
pendant que je protégeais Cyril.
Tu t'en es bien occupé.
Ah oui, très bien même.
À cause de toi, il a l'esprit embrouillé,
il est dans ce trou.
Écoute, vieille connasse, tu peux crever.
Viens, Cyril.
Le diable est en toi, Ryan.
T'es comme ton père.
Viens, Cyril.
Allez !
Cyril fait le prochain match.
- Contre qui ?
- Robson.
Je l'ai vu s'entraîner. Il est dur.
Mais sa gauche est souvent basse.
- Dis à ton frère de lui faire des crochets.
- Ce sera suffisant ?
Je veux pas que Cyril
soit abîmé davantage.
Retire-le.
Sûrement pas, putain.
Il doit bien y avoir un truc qui l'avantagera.
- Tu connais l'histoire de l'Irlandais noir ?
- Non.
Dans les années 1600,
après la défaite de l'Armada,
des marins espagnols ont échoué
sur les côtes irlandaises.
Ils parlaient pas un mot d'anglais.
Ils se sont débrouillés pour survivre.
La survie. C'est dans le sang, O'Reily.
Tu trouveras quelque chose.
Pourquoi vous n'avez personne pour boxer,
chez les chrétiens ?
On a pris la décision de ne pas participer.
C'est immoral.
C'est ça.
Tu travailles toujours à l'infirmerie ?
- Ouais.
- Oui ?
Tu veux gagner un peu de fric ?
Peut-être.
CHLORAL HYDRATÉ
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Ta gueule.
Comment tu te sens ? Bien ?
Bon round. Continue de frapper.
Te repose pas toujours sur ta droite.
Protège-toi, frappe des coups plus précis.
C'est tout bon, mec. Allez.
Assieds-toi.
Qu'est-ce qui te prend, putain ?
T'as 7 kilos de plus, il te secoue
comme une poupée de chiffon.
Bois.
James, bois encore. C'est bon. Allez.
Tu t'es fait botter le cul.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes, putain ?
Arrête de regarder le ring. Bois.
Bien. Tu lui fais la peau.
Encore un round pour la fraternité. Allez.
<i>Quand on fait la course, on veut gagner.</i>
<i>Peu importe comment.</i>
<i>Gagner à tout prix.</i>
Allez vous faire foutre.
J'étais sprinteur.
Les petites distances, ça me connaît.
Dès que le coup de départ était donné,
je fonçais ! Super rapide !
Je faisais 50 m en 6,5 secondes.
Sans déc'.
Sans me forcer.
D'où je viens, valait mieux apprendre
à courir avant de savoir marcher.
Agent Murphy ?
Je dois aller faire ma dialyse.
Non, Rebadow. C'est pas à l'ordre du jour.
À mon dernier rendez-vous,
le Dr Nathan a dit à l'assistant
- de prendre un rendez-vous pour ce matin.
- Elle a peut-être changé d'avis.
Je vais appeler pour voir.
Pour toi, je ne vois
que les visites à 15 h.
- Ma mère vient.
- Ta mère ?
- Tu es malade.
- Non, maman.
- Tu n'as jamais su mentir.
- Je suis diabétique.
Les diagnostics terribles,
Ça y va, en ce moment.
Avec la leucémie du petit Alex.
J'ai eu la photo de lui à Marineland
que tu as envoyée.
Quel voyage. Tu peux pas savoir
ce que ça lui a fait du bien.
Après ça, il rayonnait.
Maintenant, il recommence à faiblir.
Si seulement je pouvais faire davantage.
Tu le peux. Rencontre-le.
- Non.
- C'est ton petit-fils.
Non, maman.
Je leur ai dit la vérité sur toi.
- Quoi ?
- Je sais.
J'ai pas tenu parole.
Mais pour l'amour du ciel,
tu n'as jamais vu ton fils, ni ton petit-fils.
Toutes ces années de mensonges,
leur dire que tu es mort il y a longtemps.
Je ne voulais pas mourir en sachant
que la promesse faite il y a 30 ans
te sépare de ta famille.
Ça n'apportera rien de bon
de les rencontrer.
Ça n'a rien apporté de bon
de ne pas le faire.
Voilà, Rebadow. Régime Diabète Délice.
Dépêche-toi, Rebadow.
- Je fais ce que je peux.
- Avant que Schillinger rapplique.
Tous les jours, il crache dans ma nourriture
et m'oblige à manger.
- Crache dans la sienne.
- Tu veux rire ?
Il m'arracherait les glandes salivaires.
Busmalis.
Trop tard.
On échange ?
Il est en état de choc.
DF-50 en intraveineuse.
- Il a fait sa dialyse aujourd'hui ?
- Il...
Je t'ai pas dit de prendre rendez-vous ?
- J'ai oublié.
- Oublié ?
Il aurait pu mourir, connard.
Vous vous sentez mieux ?
On a eu peur.
Je peux faire autre chose pour vous ?
Je peux téléphoner ?
J'ai changé d'avis.
- Adebisi, tu m'as pincé ?
- Non, patron.
Je sais ce que t'as fait. T'as dit
que le Dr Nathan avait besoin de mon sang,
mais je sais que tu t'en es servi
pour infecter quelqu'un.
Tu sais que c'est vrai.
T'as piqué un con avec l'aiguille
pour qu'il attrape le SIDA.
Qui ça ?
Allez, Adebisi, dis-moi. Qui ?
Tu délires.
Adebisi, je comprends pas.
Pourquoi tu veux quitter la cafétéria
pour t'occuper d'une bande de pédés ?
- T'aimes pas les pédés ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu crois ?
Dehors, je les détestais.
Mais ici,
parfois, ça fait du bien
de se faire sucer.
C'est une des nombreuses différences
entre toi et moi.
Je me maîtrise.
J'aimerais être comme toi.
Pour moi,
un pédé est un pédé.
Un animal malade et pervers.
Je supporte pas d'en avoir un près de moi.
Mais vous, les Siciliens,
vous vous embrassez sur la joue.
- C'est signe de respect, pas sexuel.
- Signe de respect.
Je vois, patron.
J'ai les résultats de vos tests.
- Je ne sais comment vous dire ça.
- Sans détour.
Vous êtes séropositif.
- Quoi ?
- Je suis désolée.
Impossible. Corrigez-moi si je me trompe,
mais la seule façon d'attraper le SIDA,
c'est par le cul ou par une aiguille usagée.
J'ai fait ni l'un ni l'autre. Je suis pas Haïtien.
- C'est pas le SIDA. Vous êtes séropositif.
- Les tests sont erronés.
- J'ai vérifié.
- Vérifiez à nouveau.
- Je sais que c'est dur à accepter.
- C'est impossible.
Je vais prendre rendez-vous
avec un thérapeute.
- Et vous faire transférer...
- Transférer ?
C'est la loi.
Tous les détenus séropositifs
doivent être isolés au même endroit.
Je veux parler au directeur.
D'accord.
C'est un cauchemar.
PÉPÉ, JE T'AIME - TOMMY
Capitaine, je ne pige pas.
Quelqu'un a dû trafiquer les tests.
Tout ce que je sais,
c'est que Glynn veut me transférer au E.
- Tu veux dire qu'on te verra plus ?
- C'est ça, l'isolement, Chucky.
Les détenus du E
ne se mêlent pas à la population.
Jusqu'à mon retour,
c'est toi le chef. Vu ?
Au revoir, patron.
Merde.
Extinction des feux !
Le Dr Nathan dit que tu seras de retour
à la cité d'émeraude avant ce soir.
Tant mieux. Mes escarres ont des escarres.
Après avoir reçu
deux coups de couteau dans le dos,
c'est un miracle d'avoir récupéré si bien.
Il leur faudra bien plus
pour me faire disparaître.
- Tu ne sais toujours pas qui c'est.
- Non.
Il faisait sombre.
Ils sont arrivés par-derrière.
C'est des lâches.
Le problème...
c'est qu'on sait que c'est Schillinger.
Ou quelqu'un envoyé par lui.
- Mais on n'a pas de preuve.
- C'est embêtant, hein ?
- Ça n'a pas l'air de t'émouvoir plus que ça.
- Tu as été blessé lors de la révolte ?
Une petite poignée de main avec la mort,
Ça change ton point de vue.
J'ai tous les droits de balancer Schillinger,
il a tous les droits de me faire la peau.
- Le courrier.
- Pas vrai, Vern ?
Rien pour toi aujourd'hui, Keller.
Pas de cartes de vœux,
ni de bouquets de fleurs,
pas même une couronne mortuaire.
- On sait que tu as fait ça, Schillinger.
- Moi ?
C'est vrai que c'est logique.
Il m'a trahi par-derrière,
donc je le poignarde dans le dos.
Mais ce n'est pas moi.
J'aurais bien aimé.
Bien sûr, si ça avait été le cas,
tu y serais passé.
Très vite.
- Merci de me recevoir, ma sœur.
- Dieu a créé les heures de bureau.
- Beecher n'est pas là ?
- Non. Pourquoi ? C'est à son sujet ?
Vous savez ce qu'il y a eu entre nous ?
Tobias était amoureux de vous
et vous lui avez cassé bras et jambes.
Dit comme ça, ça ne me présente pas
sous mon meilleur jour.
Alors, redites-nous ça
afin de changer les choses.
Je suis désolé. J'ai mal agi.
Je veux me racheter à ses yeux.
Vous avez un programme
de rencontres victime-agresseur.
Je veux m'inscrire.
Il faut être deux pour danser le tango.
Tobias doit être d'accord.
Je le sais bien. C'est pour ça
que je suis là. Il vous aime bien.
Il vous respecte. Si vous le lui suggérez,
il viendra.
Vous l'aimez vraiment ?
Vous n'avez aucune raison de me croire,
mais oui.
Bien. Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
Je ne sais pas quelle est l'embrouille,
mais je ne marche pas.
T'as vu la sœur Pete, demandé
à ce qu'on participe à son programme.
Pas d'embrouille. Comme je t'ai dit,
je veux régler les choses entre nous.
Comment ?
Je ne peux pas te faire confiance.
Je ne me fais même plus confiance à moi.
Mes sentiments, putain...
La seule chose que je sais,
c'est que je vais me faire Schillinger.
- Je peux t'aider.
- J'ai pas besoin de ton aide.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire,
te le faire tout seul, ce salaud ?
Demande à Metzger.
Quoi ? T'as tué Metzger ?
Tu sais, quand j'ai tué Kathy Rockwell,
quand j'ai compris
que je lui avais ôté la vie,
j'étais plein de remords, de haine envers
moi-même, je voulais pas vraiment la tuer.
Mais Metzger.
C'était bon.
Tu sais ce qui était bon, aussi ?
T'enfoncer cette lame dans le dos.
- C'était toi ?
- T'y as jamais pensé ?
Ça aurait pu être moi,
dans le noir de la remise,
te regardant ranger du papier. Et puis,
boum, boum, baby !
C'était toi, Toby ?
Non.
Mais l'espace d'un instant,
tu as cru que c'était possible.
Ça aurait pu être le bon vieux Toby.
- T'as pas tué Metzger.
- Non.
Comment une petite salope comme moi
pourrait faire du mal ?
Si t'étais pas dans la remise,
comment tu sais
que je rangeais du papier ?
J'en sais rien.
Merde, c'était peut-être moi.
Je vais prier.
Prier pour que Dieu me montre la voie
pour baiser Schillinger.
Matricule ?
Neuf, neuf,
"S",
trois, trois, trois.
Le nom du garçon, tu sais ce que c'était ?
Schillinger.
<i>Matricule 99S333.</i>
<i>Andrew Peter Schillinger.</i>
<i>Condamné le 16 février 1999.</i>
<i>Homicide volontaire,
possession de stupéfiants.</i>
Une peine de 50 ans.
Liberté conditionnelle dans 20 ans.
Puis le Seigneur dit :
"J'ai vu l'affliction de mon peuple
qui est en Égypte,
"et j'ai entendu le cri qu'il a jeté
à cause de ses exacteurs.
"Je connais ses douleurs.
Et je suis descendu
"pour le délivrer
de la main des Égyptiens,
"et pour le faire monter de ce pays-là,
dans un pays bon et spacieux.
"Un pays ruisselant de lait et de miel."
C'est ça.
Dieu envoie Moïse en libérateur
puis lui met des bâtons dans les roues.
Dieu endurcit le cœur du pharaon
afin qu'il ne libère pas les fils d'Israël
"Moïse, libère mon peuple.
Et pharaon, qu'ils restent tes esclaves."
Dis-moi, Dieu, de quel côté es-tu ?
Schillinger, mes félicitations.
Pour quoi ?
C'est un garçon.
Un beau bébé en pleine santé.
Ton fils a débarqué hier.
Il est dans quel quartier ?
Ton préféré. La cité d'émeraude.
Faut que je voie Glynn. Tout de suite.
Beecher, Keller et O'Reily attendaient
une occasion de se venger.
Et McManus leur apporte mon fils
sur un plateau.
Votre fille a été agressée, exact ?
Elle a été battue et violée.
Vous savez ce que c'est
que de vouloir protéger les siens.
Et tu veux que je...
Transférez Andy avec moi.
Il doit vraiment t'être cher,
pour oser venir me demander une faveur.
Cela doit beaucoup te coûter
d'être là, dans mon bureau,
et d'implorer mon aide pour ton fils.
Car c'est bien ça, non ?
Tu implores mon aide ?
Oui.
Pense à toutes les fois
où cela a été l'inverse,
et où tu es resté là, un sourire accroché
aux oreilles, à me prendre pour un con.
Il s'agit de mon fils, bon sang.
- Je croyais que tu avais deux fils.
- En effet.
Tu auras peut-être plus de chance
avec l'autre. Emmenez-le.
Pourquoi McManus met son fils ici,
sachant ce qu'il y a entre nous ?
- Tu crois que c'est un piège ?
- Non.
McManus déteste ce putain de nazi
plus que nous.
Il espère peut-être
qu'on fera quelque chose.
Comme quoi ? Tu crois
qu'il veut qu'on lui règle son compte ?
Non. Schillinger n'aime pas
que son fils se drogue.
Il n'est là que depuis quelques jours,
et je lui ai déjà vendu
une sacrée cargaison de poudre.
On le laisse se défoncer
jusqu'à ce qu'il fasse une overdose ?
Ou bien...
Ou bien quoi ?
O'Reily, faut que tu me donnes de ta came.
Tout de suite, petit gars.
Hé, Vern ! Regarde un peu ton gamin.
Andrew !
Salut, papa.
Espèce de petit con.
- Hé, Lopresti.
- Oui ?
Y a pas un putain de règlement
interdisant les drogues ici ?
Si.
Suis-moi.
Va te faire foutre, papa !
Prenez mon fils
dans votre groupe de désintox.
Très bien, Vern.
Mais on ne peut obliger un drogué à arrêter,
il faut que cela vienne de lui.
Vous devriez installer des rideaux.
- Pauvre Vern. On m'a dit, pour son fils.
- Écoutez, Tobias,
Andrew va se joindre à notre groupe.
J'espère que ça ne vous dérange pas trop.
Pas du tout. Il me tarde de le rencontrer.
Bien. Souhaitons tous la bienvenue
à Andrew.
Andrew,
le but de nos réunions,
c'est de parler de soi,
de ses sentiments, de sa dépendance,
dans l'espoir d'en trouver la cause.
Si tu veux bien nous dire
à quoi tu es accro.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Petit con ! C'est une sœur.
Personne ne lui parle comme ça.
Va te faire foutre aussi.
Ah oui ? Tu vas voir.
- Une minute !
- Dégage.
Putain de merde ! C'est quoi, ce délire ?
Vas-y, connard.
Tu devais me frapper dans les côtes.
Fallait que ça fasse vrai.
Comme le nez de Mark Mack, tu vois ?
- Où est le gamin ?
- Là.
- Comment ça, plus de poudre ?
- J'ai une grosse clientèle.
Tu descends mon stock à une allure dingue.
Alors jusqu'à ce que je reçoive
la prochaine cargaison, ceinture.
Va te faire foutre.
Y a d'autres dealers...
Écoute bien. Y a moi, puis les autres.
Connaissant tes convictions,
je sais que tu feras affaire qu'avec un Blanc.
Hé, ça va ?
Tu peux m'en avoir, mec ?
Désolé.
Tu me prends pour un con.
Tu veux que Keller dégage
et qu'Andrew Schillinger prenne sa place ?
Vous vous demandez ce que je ferais
au fils d'un gars qui m'a doublé.
J'y ai pensé.
McManus, le gamin est là depuis quand ?
Je ne l'ai pas touché
alors que j'aurais pu.
En vérité, l'avoir vu dans le groupe,
Ça m'a fait pitié.
Avec cet enculé de Schillinger pour père,
y a de quoi vouloir se droguer.
Dieu sait que je suis passé par là.
Je crois pouvoir l'aider.
Je veux l'aider.
Écoute bien, Beecher...
Sœur Pete m'a dit
que tu avais pris sa défense.
Andrew partage sa cellule avec un Aryen.
Schillinger a dit à ses gars de le laisser,
ce qui fait que le gamin est de plus en plus
isolé, et ça, vous voulez l'éviter.
Je ne prétends pas savoir
ce que vous voulez ou pas,
ni pourquoi vous l'avez incarcéré ici,
du reste.
Tu devais être un assez bon avocat.
Tu sais te montrer persuasif,
quand tu veux.
Lorsqu'il le faut.
S'il lui arrive un truc, tu le paieras.
Je prendrai soin du petit Andrew
comme une vraie mère.
Salut. Au fait,
merci d'avoir cogné ce gars-là.
Enfin, d'avoir pris ma défense.
C'est bon.
Je sais ce que c'est
que d'être toujours emmerdé.
T'as des tatouages ?
Quelques-uns.
- Joli.
- Et toi ?
J'en ai un.
Voyons.
Un jour, peut-être.
On n'est pas encore assez intimes.
Maudire.
Dieu a maudit le puissant pharaon
suite à son refus de libérer les fils d'Israël.
Le pharaon est frappé par la première
des dix catastrophes à venir.
Un matin, ce bon pharaon
se rend au bord du Nil pour nager un peu,
prendre le soleil, un truc du style.
Il plonge, regarde autour de lui.
Les eaux du Nil sont changées en sang.
McManus, dans mon bureau à midi.
Pourquoi ?
Pour voir le chef du syndicat des gardiens
et le procureur de l'État.
- Envisage d'amener ton avocat.
- Pourquoi ?
Claire Howell te poursuit
pour harcèlement sexuel.
Pardon ?
Tu aurais dû me dire que tu l'avais baisée
avant que je ne la renvoie.
Mon rôle, c'est de m'assurer
que ce genre de choses n'arrive plus.
Je veux que tout le personnel suive
une formation afin d'éviter cela.
Et que la gardienne Claire Howell
réintègre son poste.
Une minute, M. Strauch, il me semble
que vous allez un peu trop vite.
Mon client n'a pas harcelé
la gardienne Howell.
Certains prisonniers
sont prêts à témoigner
avoir vu M. McManus la plaquer
contre le mur dans son bureau.
S'il y avait un agresseur,
c'était bien Claire.
Elle était venue pour m'inviter à sortir.
- Un dîner n'implique pas un rapport sexuel.
- Exact.
On a dîné, on est retournés à nos voitures.
On a commencé à s'embrasser.
Et on s'est retrouvés chez moi, à poil.
- Elle était consentante ?
- Oui.
Deux ou trois jours après,
on a recouché ensemble.
Elle a pris les choses
beaucoup plus à cœur que moi.
Je lui ai dit que c'était terminé.
Ça l'a énervé, elle m'a menacé.
Voilà ce que les prisonniers ont vu.
Et vous l'avez fait virer.
Elle a été virée pour son incompétence,
et non parce que je ne voulais plus
la baiser.
M. Strauch,
dites à la gardienne Howell
que l'État réglera cela à l'amiable.
Qu'elle retourne travailler
dès qu'elle le souhaite.
Un mot, et je hurle.
Je vous laisse. J'ai une visite.
Ma sœur.
Goodson...
J'ai demandé à te voir suite à une drôle
de visite de la part d'une jeune femme.
- Tricia Ross.
- Exact.
Donc tu la connais ?
Oui, elle fait partie de la partie plaignante
dans le procès contre l'État.
- Son frère a été abattu pendant l'émeute.
- Je vois.
Pourquoi est-elle venue te voir ?
Elle m'a dit qu'elle essayait de te joindre
mais que tu ne lui répondais pas.
- C'est vrai.
- Pourquoi ?
C'est ce que je craignais.
Elle est amoureuse de toi. Et toi, d'elle.
On ne s'est vus que deux fois.
Et depuis quand cela ne suffit-il pas ?
Quand tu as tourné le dos à notre foi,
que tu t'es converti à l'Islam,
je me suis sentie visée.
Comme si tu nous rejetais, moi et papa.
Je sais, mais c'est totalement faux.
Le pire que tu aies fait avant cela,
c'est d'avoir voulu épouser
Marilyn Crenshaw.
Je n'ai jamais compris
comment tu as pu tomber amoureux d'elle.
Pourquoi tous ces détours ?
- Cette Blanche !
- Oui !
Cette Blanche. Et voilà
que tu recommences.
Derrière tes belles paroles et ta ferveur,
se cache une partie de toi
qui veut nier qui tu es vraiment.
Combien de gens vas-tu encore blesser
avant d'accepter
qui tu es vraiment !
Et qui suis-je ? Je suis Noir,
musulman et avant tout, un homme.
Parfois, ces trois éléments
se font la guerre.
Je ne suis ni fier ni honteux
de mes sentiments pour Tricia Ross.
Car ma très chère sœur,
quand je n'écoute plus mon cœur,
quand je mets mes sentiments de côté,
alors cette prison
gagne la bataille.
Said.
Ce que tu as fait, la grève de la faim,
tu les as vraiment battus à leur propre jeu.
Oui.
Je sais que je t'ai déçu.
Tu t'es battu pour que je sois publié,
que je sois libre.
Et j'ai merdé.
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est que je n'ai pas écrit depuis,
histoire de me punir, mais ça me manque.
Sans la poésie,
je ne suis plus que l'ombre de moi-même.
Tu me demandes la permission d'écrire ?
Écris, mon frère.
Tu sais quoi ? Je vais le faire.
Et mon premier poème te sera dédié,
pour l'espoir que tu insuffles en nous.
Non, n'écris pas cela.
Si tu écris, fais-le pour toi.
Pour ton âme, pas à cause de moi.
Je ne vaux guère plus que vous tous,
tu sais.
Un voyou parmi tous les autres.
J'ai été heureuse que tu appelles...
Ne parlons pas.
Assez parlé comme ça.
Vous avez avoué avoir cassé
les bras et les jambes de Beecher.
Ses bras. Schillinger
lui a cassé les jambes.
Ah oui, c'est vrai.
On se sent moins coupable, hein ?
De lui avoir cassé que les bras.
- C'est la sœur ou la psy qui parle ?
- La psy.
Qu'est-ce qui vous a donné envie
de rentrer dans la tête des gens ?
L'idée de pouvoir les aider.
- Et c'est le cas.
- Parfois.
Parfois, j'arrive à vous faire voir la vie
sous un angle un tantinet différent,
ce qui peut peut-être vous aider
à tenir le coup un peu mieux.
Un tantinet ? Un peu ?
C'est la vitesse que vous vous donnez.
Je n'ai guère le choix. Il est rare
que les avancées soient spectaculaires.
Il ne s'agit que d'arrêts, de démarrages
en douceur et de petits sursauts.
Et cela vous frustre-t-il ?
Ça vous blesse.
Si ça me blesse ?
Non, j'ai appris à rester neutre.
- Ça ne doit pas être facile.
- Non.
- Surtout, ici.
- Oui.
Je veux dire, ce n'est pas votre faute
si vos patients ne vont pas mieux.
Mais vous vous inquiétez.
Vous vous dites...
que vous n'êtes
peut-être pas à la hauteur.
Fin de la séance. C'est l'heure des visites.
Une de mes ex-femmes vient me voir.
- Bon sang ! T'as vu l'ex de Keller ?
- Quoi ?
On m'a dit que Léo avait accepté qu'Alvarez
fasse une rencontre victime-agresseur ?
Oui. Je partais de ce pas voir Alvarez.
Formidable. Je t'accompagne.
Ray, je ne pense pas
que ce soit une bonne idée.
Je sais que tu as beaucoup aidé
Alvarez depuis son arrivée ici,
mais pour que cela fonctionne,
il faut que je tisse un lien avec lui.
Entre nous deux.
- Mais je tiens à être partie prenante.
- Je comprends bien. Mais c'est impossible.
À présent, cela va se jouer
entre Alvarez, Rivera et moi.
Miguel, j'aimerais te parler
au sujet du gardien Rivera.
Serais-tu prêt à le rencontrer
en tête-à-tête ?
- Rivera ?
- Oui.
- Moi ?
- Oui.
Pour quoi faire ?
Qu'il puisse te poser des questions,
te dire ce qu'il ressent,
et te donner l'opportunité
d'assumer la responsabilité
de l'avoir rendu aveugle.
Et je fais quoi, là ? J'en assume
la putain de responsabilité chaque jour.
Non. Miguel, cela n'a rien à voir
avec le repentir.
Il ne s'agit que de punition.
Rivera souhaite me rencontrer ?
Je ne peux lui en parler
avant de savoir si tu acceptes.
Alors ?
- D'accord.
- C'est formidable. Bien.
Le directeur a accepté
de te faire sortir du mitard
si tu acceptais
de participer à ce programme.
En échange de quoi ? Je suis sûr
qu'il attend quelque chose en retour.
Qu'est-ce qu'il veut ?
À un moment donné, il te faudra
lui dire qui a violé sa fille, Ardith.
Sinon ?
On te remettra ici.
À toi de voir.
Ce n'est pas une voie de sortie.
Mais une voie vers la rédemption.
Tu comprends ?
Allô, Eugène est-il là ? Bonjour, Tina.
C'est la sœur Peter Marie Reimondo,
je vous appelle d'Oswald.
<i>Je me demandais... Est-ce que je pourrais
passer vous voir, vous et Eugène ?</i>
<i>Ou vous pouvez passer ici,
si vous préférez.</i>
Merde alors. Mon pote de taule Alvarez.
Quoi de neuf ?
Tu as vraiment l'air reposé, mon pote.
Vous voulez qu'on pardonne à Alvarez ?
Il n'y a aucune attente de pardon.
Allons, ma sœur. On est catholiques.
On sait ce que vous cherchez.
Je ne suis pas là en tant que sœur,
ni en tant que psychologue.
Mais pour favoriser l'échange, vous écouter,
vous aider à mettre au clair vos sentiments.
"Mettre au clair" ? C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Que voulez-vous mettre au clair ?
- Tina !
- Non, Eugène.
Que voudrais-tu mettre au clair
avec cette ordure ? Il t'a arraché les yeux.
Tu ne verras jamais plus.
Au mitard ! C'est dans le couloir de la mort
qu'il devrait être. Point final.
Pourquoi tu t'infligerais
toute cette merde ?
Chérie, tu n'es pas obligée
d'y participer, mais moi, si.
Et j'ai besoin que tu comprennes ça.
Qui dit qu'Alvarez
répondra aux attentes d'Eugène.
Si je vois qu'on n'arrive
à rien, on arrête.
Et chacune des deux parties
peut décider d'arrêter à tout moment.
Vous savez ce que je veux ?
Le regarder droit dans les yeux,
l'espace d'une seconde,
l'obliger à regarder
ce qu'il a fait, et comprendre pourquoi.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ? C'est la question
que le pharaon s'est posée.
Pourquoi ce sang dans les eaux du Nil ?
Il demande aux prêtres, aux augures
mais avant qu'ils ne l'expliquent,
des nuées de grenouilles sortent du Nil
et envahissent les toits des Égyptiens.
Ils les retrouvent
dans leur lit, bain et assiette.
Le pharaon dit alors :
"Assez, que les fils d'Israël se cassent."
"Hourra ! ", se dit Moïse.
Puis, Dieu décide d'endurcir à nouveau
le cœur du pharaon.
Au dernier moment,
il décide de ne plus les laisser partir.
Soudain, de la poussière
viennent des nuées de sauterelles, de taons.
Imaginez : votre maison, votre bureau,
votre ville entière infestés d'insectes.
Imaginez le boucan, le bourdonnement...
L'insecticide en spray
ne sera inventé que 4000 ans après.
Dégage, mec.
On t'a coupé la langue,
comme à ton vieux ?
Quoi de neuf, Miguel ?
Tout d'un coup, tu reviens
à la cité d'émeraude, et tu dis rien ?
J'ai fait ce que tu m'as demandé de faire.
Tu n'as rien à me dire ?
Si tu veux parler, parlons.
Dis-moi pourquoi
ils t'ont sorti du mitard.
Tu as sucé le directeur...
Reimondo m'a inscrit
à un nouveau programme.
Arrête tes conneries. Tu nous as donnés.
Je vous ai donnés.
À la vie, à la mort, Alvarez.
Tu as juré fidélité.
Je suis des vôtres, El Cid. Des vôtres.
Bien.
Écoute, Carlo Ricardo,
il boxait pour nous.
Il a déconné, il est au mitard.
- On m'a dit que tu as déjà boxé.
- Exact.
Faut juste que tu défonces une tapette.
On me donnait des antidépresseurs
pour m'empêcher de devenir fou.
C'est bien, d'être fou. Ça fait gagner.
Arrête de prendre cette merde, mec.
C'est pas bon pour toi.
Cyril, c'est l'heure.
Allez. Debout.
Faut d'abord qu'on se ravitaille,
et puis on va boxer.
J'ai pas envie de boxer aujourd'hui.
Cool, Cyril, ton prochain combat
est dans deux semaines.
Je ne veux plus boxer.
Putain, tu commences à m'énerver
à geindre sans arrêt.
Lève ton cul.
O'Reily, ton frère a assuré
sur le ring l'autre jour.
Eh oui ! Il envoie de bons crochets. Alvarez,
c'est ton premier combat, aujourd'hui ?
Oui, contre Jason Cramer.
La pédale ? Je vais miser sur toi.
Au fait, tu avais parié que Cyril perdrait
contre Robson, aboule le fric.
Je ne comprends pas ce qui s'est passé.
Robson a perdu, point.
Cyril a gagné, point d'exclamation.
Je trouve ça bizarre qu'il ait perdu.
Tu m'accuses d'embrouilles, Guerra ?
Tu te calmes, O'Reily ?
Personne n'accuse personne.
T'auras plus de chance une autre fois.
Matricule 98C931, prisonnier Jason Cramer.
Condamné le 6 septembre 1998.
Meurtre avec préméditation, kidnapping,
agression armée.
Perpétuité sans possibilité
de liberté conditionnelle.
- Salut, O'Reily.
- Salut, Cramer.
Prêt pour le grand combat ?
- Je le sens bien.
- Tu as l'air bien.
Bien sûr, Miguel Alvarez aussi.
Je dois dire, Jason,
le fait que tu te battes contre Alvarez...
- T'as des couilles.
- Je croyais que t'avais pas vu.
Tu vas en avoir besoin.
Comment ça ?
J'ai entendu Hernandez parler
à ses chicanos.
Si tu perds, ils vont se taper Anthony,
tous ensemble.
- Le mien ?
- C'est ce qu'ils ont dit.
Vaudrait mieux pour eux
qu'ils touchent pas à lui.
On parle de 50 contre 1 pour Miguel.
Évidemment.
Ils pensent qu'un pédé ne sait pas
se battre. Écoute-moi bien.
Je sais faire deux choses dans la vie :
me battre et sucer.
Suivant !
Joli paquet, O'Reily. Tu connais les règles.
Tous les paris passent par moi.
Bien sûr.
T'essaierais pas d'y déroger, par hasard ?
Non, c'est juste mon petit pécule.
Pour me prouver ta bonne foi,
tu devrais m'en donner une petite partie.
- Petite comment ?
- 25%.
- Tu mises sur Alvarez aujourd'hui ?
- Non, sur la pédale.
C'est complètement fou.
Comme moi.
Chloral hydraté
- Tu l'as ?
- Oui.
Super, fais voir.
Je sais que ça me regarde pas,
mais c'est la deuxième fois
que tu me demandes de voler
du chloral hydraté à l'infirmerie.
- Qu'est-ce que tu en fais ?
- Tu as raison.
Ça te regarde pas.
Relève-toi !
Trois, quatre,
cinq, six, sept. Viens par là.
- Cogne. Bats-toi !
- Allez. Vas-y !
Cinq.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Tu te fais dérouiller
par une putain de pédale. Ressaisis-toi.
Allez, mec.
T'es en train de prendre une branlée.
Super !
<i>L'obscurité.</i>
Trois jours consécutifs sans lumière.
Imaginez.
Trois jours chez vous.
Pas d'électricité, pas de télé...
pas même de torche en cas de panne.
Le pharaon est là sur son trône,
dans le noir,
et se demande quand tout ça se terminera.
Tout ça du fait de Dieu. Ridicule, non ?
Que le pharaon paie pour ce que Dieu
comptait faire de toute façon.
Mais c'est loin d'être ridicule.
Les pharaons l'ont cherché
et les leurs ont trinqué avec eux.
Les fils d'Israël ont été leurs esclaves
pendant 430 ans,
un pharaon chassant l'autre.
Fallait bien qu'ils finissent
par le payer,
mort ou vif.
Baise-moi, ma belle !
Oh, putain !
Nooter et Pecky me font rire.
Qui ?
Les marionnettes.
Bien sûr, les marionnettes.
La nuit dernière, j'ai rêvé que je jouissais
entre les seins de Mlle Sally.
Tu ne devrais pas parler comme ça
de Mlle Sally. C'est une déesse.
Une déesse ? Une salope, oui.
Putain, c'est quoi, ça ?
Pas encore les fous de Dieu !
Bordel, poussez-vous !
On sait pourquoi vous regardez ça.
Assieds-toi !
- Ce n'est pas pour sa valeur éducative.
- La ferme !
- Mais par luxure.
- Pousse-toi.
- Le sermon est terminé, Cudney. Dégage.
- Non.
À vos cellules !
Salut, champion.
Ne me déconcentre pas.
Je mets K. -O. Kareem Said.
Jason Cramer a battu Miguel Alvarez.
Tim, comment ça se passe
pour le gardien Hughes ?
- Tu veux que je sois honnête ?
- Oui.
Il a du mal.
- Quel est le problème ?
- Je ne sais pas, Léo.
Je crois qu'il n'est pas fait pour ça.
- Pourquoi ?
- Je me demandais, c'est tout.
Tu m'as demandé de l'intégrer à la cité.
Tu fais plus que te demander.
Son père et moi
étions gardiens de prison ensemble.
On était comme des frères,
on se protégeait,
on s'arrangeait pour bosser ensemble.
Sam est mort il y a 17 ans.
- Il a été tué ici.
- Tu déconnes.
Clayton est son fils unique.
Hé, super combat, Alvarez.
De quoi tu parles, putain ? J'ai perdu.
Et moi, j'ai gagné.
Pourquoi tous ceux
sur qui tu mises gagnent ?
Comment dire ? J'ai un don.
Miguel, ça fait quoi
de se prendre une branlée par une pédale ?
Fais gaffe à ce que tu dis.
Ou tu me frappes
avec ton sac à main, trouduc ?
Ça suffit, vous deux !
Tu nous fais passer
pour des cons, Alvarez.
Tu nous fais passer pour des tantouses.
Va te faire foutre !
Lâche-le !
Et un coup de matraque électrique !
Comment on a pu laisser passer
une matraque électrique ?
De la même façon
qu'on laisse passer la drogue.
- Je découvrirai qui ferme les yeux.
- Une minute.
Et Hughes alors ?
Celui qui a utilisé la matraque ?
Il s'embrouille avec les Latinos,
fait entrer une arme illégalement,
il neutralise Hernandez pour un rien.
Il fait n'importe quoi.
- Tu ignores ce que c'est qu'être gardien.
- Arrête.
Tu l'ignores et tu ne le sauras jamais.
Écoute, Hughes a merdé, je m'en occupe.
Affaire classée.
Entre.
- Léo, je suis désolé de...
- Viens.
Approche.
- Regarde ça.
- Quoi ?
Regarde de plus près.
- Putain !
- Ils ont tué ton père aussi vite que ça.
Tu te crois invincible ?
Tu crées tes propres règles ?
- C'était pour me faire respecter.
- Te faire respecter ?
Je me suis excusé !
Ça ne se reproduira plus.
En effet, ça ne se reproduira plus.
Je vais être viré ?
Je te transfère à la bibliothèque.
Définitivement.
À la bibliothèque ? Léo, c'est pas...
Ça suffit ! J'ai du travail,
comme expliquer ton geste aux autres.
Salut.
Prêt à aller en ville pour ton appel ?
Je sais pas. Ce matin,
je me suis réveillé,
j'ai un bon pressentiment.
J'espère que le juge cassera le jugement.
Même si, dans ce cas,
je ne te reverrai plus.
Tu vas me manquer, Richie.
Oui, et s'ils ne le font pas...
J'ai décidé de suivre ton conseil.
Je vais dire aux flics que j'ai tué
Alexander Vogel avec l'aide de Schillinger.
Au moins, si je dois mourir,
il mourra lui aussi.
Ce ne sera que justice.
C'est bien.
J'ai presque fini ton pull.
Allez, c'est l'heure.
À bientôt, Shirley.
Non.
Adieu, mon beau.
"La marque des voleurs."
On se déguisait en policiers
et on volait les nantis russes.
Mais je me suis fait prendre
et on m'a envoyé à Tulun.
J'ai réussi à soudoyer un magistrat
et j'ai été remis en liberté,
je suis venu aux États-Unis
pour une vie meilleure.
L'Immigration t'a laissé rentrer
avec un casier judiciaire ?
Non. J'ai menti
en remplissant le questionnaire.
Mais le parquet, à Moscou,
a mis le F.B.I. au courant.
Ils m'ont suivi, mis sur écoute.
Et me voilà ici.
Y a du nouveau. Ils ont cassé
l'accusation de meurtre de Richie Hanlon.
Une faille dans le système.
Il est passé à travers les filets.
Hanlon a tué Alexander Vogel.
Tu le connaissais, Vogel.
C'était mon ennemi.
Ils libèrent Hanlon ?
Non, faut toujours qu'il purge sa peine
pour trafic de drogue.
Ils vont le remettre
en détention à la cité ?
Il est en chemin à l'heure qu'il est.
Il faut fêter ça.
J'ai de la vodka dans ma cellule.
Vraiment ? De la vodka russe ?
Comment t'as fait pour l'avoir ?
"Quand tout va,
il ne faut pas chercher à savoir pourquoi."
Bon sang, j'aurais jamais cru
être aussi heureux de revenir.
Je me sens super bien.
Tu sais, dans le couloir de la mort,
on compte les jours qui nous restent,
en sachant que notre futur se résume
à l'injection létale.
Sans blague, j'ai le cœur en fête,
prêt à exploser de joie.
Je suis si heureux d'être toujours en vie.
Désolé, tu me trouves trop bavard ?
Quoi ?
Ça fait longtemps que j'ai pas fait ça.
J'ai menti.
Alexander Vogel était mon ami.
La dernière plaie est la pire.
Celle qui peut remettre en cause
notre amour de Dieu.
Tous les premiers-nés d'Égypte furent tués
en une seule nuit alors que tous dormaient.
Vous êtes l'aîné de la famille ?
Vous y seriez passé. Un point c'est tout.
Le fils du pharaon y est aussi passé.
Son héritier,
la prunelle de ses yeux,
son cher
et innocent petit garçon.
<i>Extinction des feux, Shirley.</i>
Vous êtes séropositif.
- Impossible.
- Je prends rendez-vous avec un thérapeute.
- Et je vous fais transférer...
- Transférer ?
Tous les détenus séropositifs
doivent être isolés au même endroit.
C'est un cauchemar.
Je peux vous offrir à boire, mon père ?
Un cappuccino ?
Vous avez une machine à cappuccino ?
J'essaie de tirer le maximum
de cette situation critique.
Le seul avantage que je vois à être ici,
c'est que les matons nous voient
déjà morts et sont donc plus coulants.
Je prendrais bien un cappuccino.
Bien, asseyez-vous.
Vous savez, mon père, vous avez
toujours été un maton en soutane pour moi.
Je sais que beaucoup n'ont pas confiance,
mais j'essaie de leur prouver
que je ne suis pas là pour moucharder.
Je suis bien au-delà de ça.
De là où je viens, on devient
l'une des quatre choses suivantes :
docteur, avocat, prêtre
ou on rejoint la grande famille.
Je vois.
Et pour entrer dans cette famille-là,
on brûle un saint.
- Vous le saviez ?
- Oui.
On brûle l'image d'un saint
en signe d'abandon de l'Église
et comme preuve de loyauté
envers cette nouvelle famille.
- Tout à fait.
- Merci.
Je croyais qu'il y avait eu
une erreur d'analyse pour ma séropositivité,
alors j'ai demandé à mon docteur de vérifier,
mais c'est bien vrai.
Vous savez, être séropositif
ne vous condamne pas à mort.
Beaucoup vivent...
J'ai déjà entendu ça,
pas la peine de vous fatiguer.
Chez nous, on est toujours prêt à mourir,
prêt à recevoir une balle, une seule,
dans la nuque,
mais mourir à petit feu comme ça,
c'est différent.
Ça vous laisse le temps de réfléchir.
De repenser à vos actes passés.
Je veux me confesser.
Vous confesser ?
Je veux confesser tous les péchés
que j'ai pu commettre au cours de ma vie.
Tous...
et faire acte de contrition.
Très bien.
Ça fait longtemps.
Vous me rafraîchissez la mémoire ?
Pardonnez-moi, mon père, car j'ai péché...
Ah oui, c'est comme le vélo.
Pardonnez-moi, mon père, car j'ai péché.
Le dernier péché
que j'ai confessé, c'était...
Boss, tu as deux secondes ?
Oui, assieds-toi.
Y a bien longtemps, Nino Schibetta
m'a appris à jouer à ce jeu.
La pelote.
La pelote. C'est la belote, crétin.
On était proches. De très bons potes.
Il me trouvait plus italien
que n'importe quel autre renoi.
Adebisi, tu es d'humeur
à parler du bon vieux temps ?
Va faire ça ailleurs.
On pourrait s'associer.
- J'ai déjà un associé. Wangler.
- Mais tu le détestes.
Toi aussi, je te déteste et alors ?
J'ai pas oublié
que tu m'as fracassé le crâne.
Tu essayais de me tuer
parce que j'étais un rival de taille.
Je pourrais être un allié de taille.
Je t'écoute.
S'il arrivait malheur à Wangler,
on pourrait s'associer.
Pourquoi pas.
Bien.
T'as vu ça ? Faut qu'on bute Adebisi.
- Nappa a dit de laisser faire.
- J'emmerde Nappa. Il est plus là.
Oui. On m'a dit ça.
Je sais que Wangler et sa bande
vous emmerdent.
- Ces fils de putes.
- Tu le laisses parler, oui ?
C'est simple. Vous m'aidez
à me débarrasser de ces renois,
- et on gère le trafic de drogue.
- Très simple.
Et les Blancs, ils en disent quoi ?
Lls s'en foutent,
ils veulent juste que le boulot soit fait.
Tu veux qu'on t'aide
à te débarrasser des tiens ?
Ce ne sont pas les miens.
Je suis un Africain.
Bon.
Ça marche.
Messieurs, vous êtes
dans la salle d'informatique.
C'est peut-être idiot,
mais quand je vois des gens ici,
je m'attends à les voir
utiliser les ordinateurs. Pas comme vous,
ce qui me mène à penser,
parce que je suis un malin,
que vous êtes là pour autre chose.
Excusez mon manque de confiance,
mais vous préparez sûrement un sale coup.
Voilà, c'est ça, allez faire un tour.
On y va. Toi aussi, Simon.
J'utilise l'ordinateur.
Je peux te faire une petite suggestion ?
Allume-le.
<i>On récolte ce que l'on sème.</i>
<i>Le pharaon a eu ce qu'il méritait.</i>
<i>Mais qu'en est-il du fermier lambda
qui s'est réveillé encerclé de grenouilles,</i>
<i>son troupeau tué par le bacille du charbon,
sa femme couverte de pustules,</i>
<i>son fils unique mort,
tout ça à cause d'un chef autoproclamé ?</i>
<i>Qu'en est-il de ceux qui récoltent
ce qu'ils n'ont pas semé ?</i>
<i>Des bébés, nés accros au crack, des petits
qui sont violés, du nettoyage ethnique ?</i>
<i>Et qu'en est-il de toi ?</i>
<i>Y a-t-il une loi dans l'univers,</i>
<i>une loi sur la souffrance inutile ?</i>
<i>Une loi que même Dieu ne peut enfreindre ?</i>
C'est tout ?
- Tu es sûr ?
- Oui.
- Vérifie encore.
- Y a rien d'autre. Maintenant, dégage.
Qu'est-ce que tu as reçu ?
Une carte d'anniversaire de ma mère.
- C'est ton anniversaire ?
- Aujourd'hui.
Ça te fait quel âge ?
Je fête mes 18 ans dans ce trou à rats.
Putain, 18 ans !
Ça fait de toi un putain de vrai homme.
Arrête. Je suis un homme depuis un bail.
Me cherche pas.
Fiston, allons snifer une ligne
entre hommes.
Ça me branche bien. Bricks, tu viens ?
Je vous rejoins.
Faut que je passe un coup de fil.
- Je vous retrouve. À plus, les gars.
- D'accord.
Laurie, ça va ? Oui ? Et le bébé ?
Super.
T'aurais pas oublié un truc ?
Mon anniversaire.
C'est bon.
Dans ma lettre, je te demandais des pompes.
Les miennes me tuent les pieds.
Je sais que c'est juste, côté thune,
alors arrange-toi, d'accord ?
Bon, écoute, faut
que j'y aille, d'accord ?
Moi aussi, je t'aime. D'accord, salut.
- Maman, tu as vu Laurie ?
- Pas récemment.
Elle m'a amené le bébé
il y a à peu près trois semaines.
Je l'ai gardé tout le week-end.
- Elle allait où ?
- Je sais pas.
- Tu lui as pas demandé ?
- Si. Elle a parlé d'une amie malade.
Chéri, au ton de sa voix,
j'ai compris qu'elle me mentait.
- Tu n'as jamais pu la voir.
- Et voilà pourquoi.
Elle est maman. Elle devrait être chez elle
avec son enfant, et pas se balader.
Avec qui elle se balade ?
J'ai mon idée là-dessus.
Qui ça ?
Ronnie Smith.
Quoi ? Elle sait
que j'aime pas cet enculé !
- Et il y a autre chose.
- Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je connais cette expression. Dis-moi tout.
Je pense qu'il bat le bébé.
Le petit Jordan a des bleus partout.
Elle dit qu'il est tombé.
Les bébés se font mal,
mais pas à ce point.
Bordel ! Quel enculé ! Récupère mon fils !
Dès que je sors d'ici,
je vais me faire cet enculé !
J'en ai rien à foutre !
Je l'ai déjà dit et je le répète.
Toutes les femmes sont des salopes.
Le renoi qu'elle se tape bat mon fils,
la chair de ma chair,
mon prince. Je rêve !
C'est quoi ce bordel, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que je peux faire ici ?
Comment je peux l'aider d'ici ?
Toi et moi, on sait
qui peut s'occuper de ça.
Si je demande aux miens,
les flics remonteront jamais jusqu'à toi.
Appelle-les.
Je paierai ce qu'il faut, rien à battre.
Je veux voir Ronnie Smith mort.
Qu'il meure, cet enculé.
Pierce...
ma femme aussi.
Maman ? Oui, c'est moi. Écoute,
je veux que tu ailles chez Laurie ce soir
et que tu emmènes le petit avec toi.
Ne pose pas de questions.
Va là-bas et emmènes le petit avec toi.
Tu as bien compris ?
Emmène-le avec toi, maman. Bon.
Moïse réussit finalement à amener
le peuple élu en Terre Promise.
La situation ne s'améliora guère.
Ils menèrent des guerres sans arrêt,
contre les Cananéens, les Héthiens,
les Jébusiens.
Finalement, les fils d'Israël
furent écrasés par les Romains.
On continue à souffrir,
ce qui m'amène à me demander :
Y a-t-il trop de souffrances en ce monde ?
J'emmerde le monde entier. Ici, à Oz,
il y a trop de souffrances,
même pour un homme coupable d'un délit.
Bricks, tu viens ?
Pas tout de suite,
mais je vous rejoins dans une minute.

"Neige, pluie, canicule,
ou bien nuit noire,
"rien ne saurait empêcher un facteur
d'accomplir prestement sa tournée."
C'est la devise optimiste
des services postaux américains,
inspirée de l'historien grec Hérodote.
À l'époque, "prestement"
pouvait signifier un an et un jour.
Maintenant, il est 10 heures,
c'est partout le lendemain,
d'ici à Cochabamba.
Partout, l'après-midi, les gens attendent
devant la boîte aux lettres
se demandant ce qu'elle peut bien contenir.
On ne sait jamais à quoi s'attendre.
Et à Oz, la plupart du temps,
c'est l'attente le meilleur moment.

Ouais. Maintenant,

Il a tué mon bébé, j'ai tué le sien.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas lui dire,
quand tu vas le voir ?
Qui ça ?
Le fils du médecin, au paradis.
Je sais déjà ce que je vais dire
au mari du Dr Nathan,
si on me laisse entrer là-bas.
Où t'étais passé, bordel ?
Viens. On n'a pas beaucoup de temps.
Mets ça.
- Non.
- Cyril, commence pas.
- J'ai pas envie de boxer.
Je suis pas obligé.
Si.
Non, M. Cudney dit que je suis pas obligé.
- Cudney ?
- Ouais.
Dieu ne veut pas que je boxe.
D'accord, pas de boxe aujourd'hui.
- T'es pas fâché ?
- Non.
En fait, je crois que tu devrais écouter
ce que dit M. Cudney.
C'est rien.
O'Reily. Tu viens à la prière ?
Ouais.
"C'est une calamité qui m'arrive.
Je la supporterai."
D'abord, tu vas dire à mon frère
qu'il peut boxer.
Ensuite promets-moi
de ne plus jamais lui parler.
Pigé ?
J'avais jamais vu l'utilité de la Bible.
Je peux la garder ?
- Oui.
- C'est ce que je pensais.
Gloria.
- Fais gaffe, O'Reily.
- Enculé.
- Hé, Bricks.
- O'Reily.
T'es le seul à t'en souvenir.
Tu jauges tes adversaires ?
Lls ont intérêt à faire leur prière.
Mon pote Bricks
va leur faire bouffer le tapis.
J'en sais rien. J'ai vu Khan
s'entraîner à la gym. Il est au top.
- Mon renoi aussi.
- Viens fumer un joint.
Attends.
Tu veux fumer
le jour de ton premier combat ?
Tu l'as dit. Je suis Mike Tyson, mec.
Je fais la fête, je boxe et je refais la fête.
À plus tard.
Pancamo. Je parie 5000 $ sur Khan.
- Gros pari.
- J'ai du fric à claquer, mec.
Hamid ?
Oui ?
Tu devrais savoir que Wangler
raconte des saloperies sur toi et Said.
Il est temps de donner une leçon
à cette racaille.
T'en fais pas, je vais gagner.
Au nom d'Allah.
C'est ça. Fous-lui une branlée.
Ouais, c'est ça.
Kenny Wangler "Bricks" !
Et face à lui, Hamid Khan !
Écoutez-moi bien à tout moment.
Saluez-vous et rejoignez votre coin.
Prêts ! Sonnez la cloche !
Taille-le en pièces, Khan !
Beau coup, Bricks. T'es bien comme Tyson.
Cecily Tyson !
Un paquet arrive à l'improviste.
On l'ouvre.
Parfois, c'est un cadeau,
une bouteille de bon vin,
disons, de la famille.
Parfois, ça vient des terroristes.
Une petite boîte de rien qui fait boum.
Les musulmans nous cherchent.
À nous de les faire chier.
J'ai un poème, les gars.
Depuis que je suis revenu à Oz,
j'écris plus de poème.
Mais j'ai vu un truc l'autre jour
qui m'a inspiré.
Alors ce poème est dédié
à notre Imam Kareem Said.
"Voilà
"J'ai pigé, t'es que de l'épate
"Tout ce qui te branche
c'est de te graisser la patte
"Capitaliser
"Tu vois, l'Amérique est devant ton nez
"Depuis plus de 450 années
"Et tu voudrais cacher tes larmes
"Dans la soi-disant mission
qu'Allah t'a confiée pour aider tes frères
"Sache qu'Allah m'a ouvert les yeux
et je vais dire à tous ce que j'ai vu
"Tu parles de révolution,
Moi, j'ai eu une révélation
"Tu flirtes avec la fille du diable
"Et t'es content de manipuler son esprit
"Je vais te dire un truc qui te fera réfléchir
pendant qu'on est ici en train de moisir
"et que t'essaies de nous trouver
une place au paradis
"Quand elle oubliera
ta gueule et ses contradictions
"Tu ferais mieux de planquer
tes gants maudits"
On est passés d'une humiliation privée
à une publique.
- Tu nous fais honte à tous.
- Tu as le choix, Said.
C'est elle ou nous.
Tu promets de ne jamais revoir cette femme
ou t'es foutu.
Foutu ?
On choisira un autre chef.
Dis-moi ce qui va pas.
Je reçois des coups de fil,
des menaces,
on me demande de ne pas t'approcher.
De ne pas m'approcher ?
J'ai gardé la cassette du répondeur,
peut-être...
que tu la veux, ou l'avocat, je sais pas.
- T'as changé de numéro de téléphone ?
- Ouais.
Mais je peux pas déménager.
Et s'ils découvrent où j'habite ?
Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi on me dit de ne pas t'approcher ?
T'en fais pas pour ça.
Je vais parler à Zelman.
Il saura quoi faire.
- Comment te protéger.
- Je ne veux pas être loin de toi.
On les emmerde. Mon Dieu, pardon.
Non, t'as raison.
On les emmerde.
Dites-moi qu'aucun de vous n'est au courant
de menaces téléphoniques à Tricia Ross.
Dites-le-moi.
J'ignore qui c'est, mais il paiera.
Dans cette vie ou la suivante.
Quand je me suis marié, je me suis fait
tatouer le nom de ma femme sur le bras.
C'est con, hein ?
Comme si un mariage durait
aussi longtemps qu'un tatouage.
J'ai dit à Shannon que je voulais divorcer
à cause de ce que je ressens pour Gloria.
J'aime encore Gloria,
j'essaie de lutter mais j'y arrive pas.
Je l'ai dans la peau, mec.
Dans la peau, putain.
Tu parles, mec,
je vais lui foutre une raclée à cet enculé.
- D'accord ? On ne fait qu'un !
- Tu vas te marrer, tu vas voir.
Tu nous demandes de buter
Wangler, Pierce et le Poète,
et puis tu dis d'attendre.
Je veux pas les tuer,
sinon ce sera la guerre
entre nous et les autres renois.
- Je veux juste leur faire un peu mal.
- Il a raison.
Faut que ça ressemble à un accident.
Le Poète et Pierce en premier.
J'ai mon idée pour Wangler.
Bricks, merde ! C'est Bricks !
- Il faut que je te parle.
- Quoi ?
Mauvaise nouvelle.
- Ta femme est morte.
- Quoi ?
Elle a été flinguée.
- Merde.
- C'est merdique.
C'est triste, Kenny. Très triste.
- C'est pas tout.
- Quoi ?
Elle a été trouvée avec un autre homme,
Ronnie Smith.
Merde, Ronnie. C'était mon pote.
On les a trouvés au lit ensemble.
Je t'ai pris rendez-vous
avec sœur Peter Marie.
Mon bébé. Et mon fils ?
Il va bien. Il était chez ta mère.
Amen.
- Je peux faire quelque chose ?
- Non.
Les flics savent qui c'est ?
On pense que c'est lié à la drogue.
Je peux aller à l'enterrement ?
Je verrai ce que je peux faire.
J'ai failli mourir
à force de m'empêcher de rire.
Attends, t'as vu la tronche
que j'ai faite ?
Non, arrête.
Hé, Kenny, tu voulais
que cette salope crève, et Ronnie aussi,
ils ont été butés. Qui est-ce qui t'aime ?
- Vous tous.
- On se débrouille bien, hein ?
Allons fumer un joint.
Bien sûr, toute lettre de l'extérieur
est une bombe en puissance
qui explose avec les souvenirs
de comment était la vie
avant que les grilles ne se referment.
Avant que quelqu'un,
certainement pas maman,
hurle : "Extinction des feux !"
<i>Parfois, plus la lettre est douce,
plus le goût est ensuite amer.</i>
<i>"Mon cher fils,</i>
<i>"Je me suis réveillée ce matin
en pensant à la vie quand tu seras libre.</i>
<i>"Je me dis que chaque jour
me rapproche du jour de ton retour.</i>
<i>"Un jour de moins
avant qu'on ne soit à nouveau réunis.</i>
<i>"Rien n'a changé ici.</i>
<i>"Le quartier n'a pas bougé.</i>
<i>"Les visages, personne n'a bougé.</i>
<i>"Est-ce que tout va bien là-bas ?</i>
<i>"Est-ce qu'on peut faire quelque chose ?</i>
<i>"Tu nous manques.</i>
<i>"Nous t'aimons."</i>
Ça fait trop mal.
- J'ai rien vu.
- Et toi ?
À vos cellules !
Junior, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Pourquoi on est enfermés ?
Bienvenue, Kenny.
C'est terrible, ce qui est arrivé
au Poète et à Pierce.
- Ils vont s'en tirer ?
- Pour l'instant.
- La vie ne tient qu'à un fil.
- Et moi ?
Comment tu t'en sors avec le programme ?
Tu as rencontré Rivera ?
Non, je parle surtout à sœur Peter Marie.
- De quoi ?
- De tout et de rien.
Tant que tout et rien
ne se connaissent pas,
t'as rien à craindre de moi.
Je te préviens, Miguel,
on ne peut pas prévoir
ce que ça déclenchera au niveau affectif
d'être face au gardien Rivera ou à sa femme.
En le rendant aveugle,
tu leur as fait du mal à tous les deux.
Ils ne seront peut-être pas touchés
par ta douleur
et la culpabilité que tu ressens.
Dis-moi ce que tu as fait
à Eugène Rivera ?
Vous savez ce que j'ai fait.
Je vois pas pourquoi
on perd du temps à le rabâcher.
On a tout le temps.
C'est important d'énoncer
ce que tu as fait.
Alors, c'était quand ?
L'été dernier.
- Pourquoi tu l'as fait ?
- J'en sais rien.
J'étais complètement largué.
Il s'est passé un truc,
je suis devenu nerveux.
J'en sais rien. C'est arrivé, c'est tout.
Qu'est-ce qui est arrivé ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu as fait,
Miguel Alvarez ?
Merde !
- J'ai gravement amoché ses yeux.
- Comment ça ?
Je les ai crevés.
Ses yeux.
<i>Le scalpel...</i>
Je l'ai lâché.
Quand il a touché le sol,
il a fait un bruit métallique.
Bien.
Tu veux t'asseoir ?
Pourquoi tu as fait ça ?
Je vous l'ai déjà dit.
- J'étais nerveux, tout ça.
- Non, Miguel.
Pourquoi tu as fait ça.
C'était délibéré, quand même.
Il va falloir dire à Eugène pourquoi,
il va te le demander.
Je le ferai.
Pourquoi tu ne me le dis pas ?
Parce que je ne vous dois rien, à vous.
C'est à lui que je veux parler.
Face à face et lui demander pourquoi.
- Il est là, Eugène.
- Vraiment ?
Alors, il répond quoi ? J'entends rien.
J'entends que des voix comme la mienne,
mais elles disent pas pourquoi
Alvarez a fait ça.
Pourquoi je méritais ça.
Vous n'y êtes pour rien
dans ce qui est arrivé.
Et Dieu ne vous donnera pas de réponse
de sa grosse voix.
Il vous répondra
quand vous parlerez à Alvarez.
Alors dites-moi
ce que vous voulez lui dire.
J'arrête pas de penser
que quelqu'un va ouvrir la porte
et me faire sortir du noir.
Quoi d'autre ?
- Que voulez-vous dire d'autre ?
- Je peux pas. Pas devant vous.
Allons, je suis une grande fille.
Allez-y, peu importe ce que c'est.
Je te hais, Alvarez,
espèce de salaud d'enculé.
À cause de toi,
je traîne toute cette merde dans le noir.
Si Tina n'était pas là,
je me serais déjà suicidé.
Des fois, je me dis
que je devrais le faire pour elle,
pour qu'elle refasse sa vie sans moi.
Y a des jours, Alvarez, où j'aurais préféré
que tu m'aies tué au lieu de me faire ça.
Je peux plus pleurer. Tu sais ça ?
Avec ce que t'as fait,
je peux plus pleurer.
Les prospectus.
On vous vend ça, on vous promet ci.
Vous êtes le prochain gagnant,
le grand concours de l'année...
On vous dit qu'il faut ouvrir l'enveloppe,
vous pourriez devenir millionnaire.
Vous savez que c'est des conneries,
alors, poubelle.
Et si c'était une erreur ?
Et si c'était la chance de votre vie ?
Cette plainte pour harcèlement sexuel
me bouffe.
Si on règle ça à l'amiable,
Howell retrouve son poste,
ce qui avère ma culpabilité.
Mais je ne suis pas coupable, putain.
Tu es victime de notre époque, l'ami.
Il y a des années,
quand une femme se plaignait,
personne ne la croyait.
Tout le monde s'en foutait.
Aujourd'hui, un mec dans un bureau
est un porc aux mains baladeuses.
- Ce qui, bien sûr, est vrai.
- Non, pas moi !
Allez. Tu as dit que tu avais baisé
toutes les femmes qui bossent ici,
à part sœur Peter Marie.
Je peux pas prendre du bon temps ?
Elles étaient toutes consentantes.
Jamais je ne forcerais une femme,
userais de mon autorité pour coucher.
- Prouve-le.
- Comment ?
Poursuis-la, ne règle pas ça à l'amiable.
Demande à Nathan,
Wittlesey et sœur Peter Marie
de témoigner en ta faveur.
- Confronte Howell.
- Je n'ai aucune chance.
En a-t-on jamais ?
Pour les médias, ce serait le rêve.
Donc si je veux donner suite, il faut
que je sois prêt à voir ma tête à la télé,
- et à faire les gros titres.
- Oui.
Et si les gens n'écoutent qu'à moitié,
ou oublient la moitié de ce qu'ils lisent,
l'affaire fera la une
pendant quelques jours,
vous aurez d'abord l'air coupable,
quels que soient les faits,
et l'affaire s'évanouira.
Le temps qu'on gagne,
personne ne le saura.
Mais vous serez marqué
par ces quelques premiers jours,
à vie.
Gloria, qu'est-ce que tu sais de cette plainte
pour harcèlement contre Tim ?
Claire Howell, du quartier d'isolement,
dit que Tim l'a fait virer
pour avoir refusé
d'autres rapports sexuels avec lui.
J'y crois pas, et toi ?
Non.
Mais ?
Je suis sortie avec Tim.
Tu sais, quand je me suis séparée.
Quand il s'agit de sexe et de relations,
il est...
J'en sais rien.
Aujourd'hui, tout est possible.
Pete, Gloria,
je suis content de vous trouver.
Je prépare mon procès,
et j'aimerais que vous témoigniez
toutes deux pour moi.
- D'accord.
- Merci.
- Gloria ?
- Oui, je vais réfléchir.
Quoi ? Tu ne crois pas Claire Howell, si ?
Non, je veux juste lui parler,
voir ce qu'elle dit.
Ce qu'elle dit ?
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire, bordel ?
Que tu crois que ce qu'elle dit
est peut-être vrai ?
Ce qui signifie que je mens, donc que
tu me crois capable d'abuser d'une femme.
Non, je n'ai pas...
Merci beaucoup.
Bonjour, la confiance, putain.
Tim, attends...
Comment va Dee Dee ?
Sa grand-mère lui manque. À moi aussi.
On a tous les genres ici.
Ceux qui ont violé, frappé ou tué
des femmes.
Ryan O'Reily a fait tuer le mari de Gloria
parce qu'il l'aimait à la folie.
Je me souviens, à l'époque,
je me suis dit :
"Une telle passion...
"Pourrais-je jamais aimer
avec une telle passion ?"
J'allais me retourner
contre cette plainte pour harcèlement.
J'allais te demander, avec Gloria,
de témoigner en ma faveur
pour me défendre car Howell ment.
Je ne l'ai forcée à rien.
- Alors pourquoi tu ne le fais pas ?
- Parce que je suis coupable.
De l'avoir utilisée, elle, son corps.
De m'être foutu d'elle,
de ses sentiments pour moi,
de ses sentiments à elle.
Maintenant, je sais que j'ai fait
la même chose à mon ex-femme.
À Gloria.
À toi.
Diane, si je t'avais demandé
de témoigner pour moi, tu l'aurais fait ?
Oui.
Parce que notre relation était vraie,
même si elle a été brève.
<i>Matricule 99K87 1, Yuri Kosygin.</i>
<i>Condamné le 23 mars 1999.</i>
Huit meurtres avec préméditation,
quatre tentatives d'assassinat,
possession illégale d'arme à feu.
Condamné à perpétuité
sans possibilité de liberté conditionnelle.
Nikolaï Stanislofsky, Yuri Kosygin.
Bonjour.
Ils m'ont demandé
si je savais qui tu étais.
J'ai dit que non.
Même si j'ai entendu parler de toi.
Tu es venu me tuer ?
Laisse-moi tranquille.
Bien,
d'après ton emploi du temps,
tu travailleras ici, à la bibliothèque,
de 12 h à 15 h,
tu aideras la bibliothécaire, tu vois...
À ranger les livres sur les étagères.
Tu emmèneras aussi
le chariot de livres à l'infirmerie,
chez les sidéens et dans le quartier E.
- Tu comprends ?
- Oui.
Respire de temps en temps, je sais pas.
Assieds-toi là
jusqu'à ce que Mme Hubble revienne.
C'est toi Kosygin ?
J'ai entendu parler de toi.
Le plus terrible
des tueurs de Little Odessa.
Antonio Nappa.
Je te tends la main en signe d'amitié.
J'ai pas besoin de ton amitié.
Très bien.
Je vais te dire un truc.
Mes gars contrôlent
tout ce qui entre et sort de cette tôle.
La drogue, les clopes, le jeu.
Si tu commences à faire le mariole,
tu seras mort avant demain.
Les Italiens.
Vous adorez le mélo.
Oui ?
M. Nappa m'a dit que ton pote, là,
comment il s'appelle,
a besoin d'apprendre le respect.
Kosygin n'est pas mon pote.
Je suis juif. Il est cosaque.
Dans ma communauté,
il est craint pour sa brutalité.
Un monstre !
Les Siciliens,
vous vous prenez pour des durs.
Il vous découperait le cœur et le boufferait
sans y réfléchir à deux fois.
Ouais, eh bien, tu ferais mieux
de lui causer.
Avant que je le fasse.
- Alors, t'en dis quoi ?
- De quoi ?
Le nouveau, Kosygin.
J'ai essayé de discuter avec lui au dîner.
Il est resté froid comme la toundra.
- Il me fout une de ces trouilles.
- À moi aussi.
Extinction des feux.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as reçu, Busmalis ?
- J'ai écrit à Mlle Sally.
Mon Dieu ! Regardez.
- Y a même un autographe.
- C'est des faux.
- Quoi ?
- C'est un faux.
- Ils sont faits sur ordinateur.
- Comment tu sais ça ?
Mlle Sally est peut-être réelle,
mais pas les marionnettes. Surtout Nooter.
- Pourquoi ?
- Il a pas de mains. Comment il signe ?
Avec sa bouche.
S'il peut tenir un marteau avec,
il peut écrire avec.
Il y a une lettre.
"Cher Agamemnon, merci d'avoir écrit.
Nooter, Pecky et moi sommes heureux
"que notre émission te plaise.
Continue de la regarder. Mlle Sally."
Lettre type.
T'es vraiment cynique, mon salaud.
Tu crois que Mlle Sally lit
toutes les lettres qu'elle reçoit ?
Avec ces nichons, elle aurait
des millions de lettres par jour.
- Il y a une secrétaire qui s'occupe de ça.
- Non. C'est vrai ?
Reste dans ton monde imaginaire.
Qu'est-ce que ça peut me foutre ?
J'ai une idée.
On devrait écrire à Mlle Sally
pour l'inviter à nous rendre visite.
- Une visite ?
- Désolé. Mlle Sally ne viendra pas à Oz.
Peut-être. Qui sait ?
Je vais lui écrire. Tout de suite.
J'aimerais bien la sauter, putain.
Je me ferais bien une partie à quatre
avec Nooter et Pecky.
Quoi ?
C'est l'heure des visites.
- Je vais aller voir ma famille.
- Ils se lassent pas, les tiens.
C'est bon. Du moment
qu'ils amènent des bonnes choses.
- Tu l'as dit.
- Un de ces jours,
je viendrai remercier ta mère
en personne, d'accord ?
Où est papa ?
Qu'est-ce qui est arrivé ?
Papa a eu une attaque.
Une attaque ?
- Quand ?
- Il y a deux jours, à la maison.
Heureusement, maman ne travaillait pas.
- Il est en soins intensifs.
- Merde. Il va s'en tirer ?
Les médecins disent
qu'ils font tout ce qu'ils peuvent.
- Je l'ai appelé l'autre jour pour m'excuser.
- Pour quoi ?
D'avoir juré contre Isabella.
Mais avant que je dise...
on a commencé à parler d'autre chose.
Un truc con. C'était quoi ?
Bon sang, c'était quoi ?
- T'en fais pas.
- Non, je m'en souviens pas !
J'ai appelé pour m'excuser, mais avant que
je dise un mot, il m'a demandé un truc et...
- Putain !
- Du calme, Ricardo.
Il vous a dit quelque chose ?
Après la dernière visite ?
- Sur quoi ?
- Ce que j'ai dit. Il était fâché ?
Carlo, c'est rien. Je crois pas, non.
Il t'aime.
Si tu veux dormir,
retourne dans ta cellule.
Hier, une lettre est arrivée à Oz,
datée du 7 mai 1965.
Trente-quatre ans.
Elle a dû se coincer dans la trieuse.
Le détenu à qui elle était adressée
est mort depuis longtemps.
Ils ont pris l'enveloppe,
et l'ont jetée dans les lettres mortes,
sans même l'ouvrir.
Maintenant, personne ne saura jamais
ce qu'il y avait dedans.
Clayton, qu'est-ce que tu fais encore là ?
C'est arrivé où, Léo ?
Je veux savoir à quel endroit exactement
mon père est mort.
- Clayton...
- Montre-moi.
Ici. Juste là.
Tu sais, je me demande. Tu crois
que celui qui l'a tué est toujours en vie ?
À Oz ?
Je me demande si le type
sur qui je me penche à la bibliothèque
est la sale brute
qui a poignardé mon père ?
Rebadow.
Il y a 17 ans, un gardien de prison
a été buté au déjeuner.
- Tu t'en souviens ?
- Tellement d'années, tellement de morts.
- Tout se mélange.
- Le gardien s'appelait Samuel Hughes.
Votre père ?
Oui. Tu te souviens de lui ?
Je suis désolé.
- Tu dois bien te souvenir.
- Non, je le jure.
Ça me suffit pas.
Je veux que tu réfléchisses.
- Tu m'entends, Rebadow ? Réfléchis.
- Je vous en prie...
Pense à mon père, espèce de salaud !
Gardien.
Je ne sais pas quoi faire.
Je devrais dire ce que j'ai vu à Léo ?
Hughes a fait deux grosses erreurs
depuis qu'il a débuté.
Quand il était avec moi
à la cité d'émeraude,
il s'en prenait aux Latinos,
et puis il a utilisé
sa matraque électrique.
Mais il a des circonstances atténuantes.
Son père a été tué ici.
Ça doit lui peser, au directeur aussi.
Tu devrais suivre ton instinct.
Il faut parler à Clayton,
voir ce qui se passe.
Père Mukada,
je m'excuse pour ce que vous avez vu.
- J'ai mal réagi.
- Ne vous excusez pas auprès de moi.
Mais de Rebadow, oui.
Sachez juste
que je sais ce que vous ressentez.
La prochaine fois que la rage vous prend,
venez me voir. Peut-être qu'ensemble,
je ne sais pas, que je pourrai vous aider.
La seule chose qui m'aidera,
c'est de savoir qui.
Qui a tué mon père.
Si vous ne pouvez pas m'aider là-dessus,
alors on n'a rien à se dire, mon père.
<i>Cher John</i>
Et puis, bien sûr, il y a la lettre "Cher John".
Ou Jane, ça dépend des cas.
Quand votre bien-aimée, ou ancien amour,
finit par dire que vous avez gâché sa vie,
l'avez fait souffrir,
qu'elle vous a tant donné,
a essayé de vous aider,
et que pour la remercier,
vous l'avez laissée tomber.
Et que oui, elle a trouvé
quelqu'un d'autre.
Quelqu'un d'autre qui comprend vraiment
ce que c'est que d'aimer.
<i>Cher John</i>
Parlons de votre pacte avec Schillinger.
Vous l'avez rencontré à Lardner, non ?
Comment décrire
vos rapports avec lui là-bas ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on est,
quand on débute au couvent ?
- Un postulant ?
- J'étais un postulant.
C'était la mère supérieure.
Vous savez, je dois vous dire, ma sœur,
avant de vous rencontrer, je croyais
que les sœurs étaient des vieilles filles
qui s'étaient retirées de la vie.
Comment le saviez-vous ?
Quoi donc ?
Que Dieu vous appelait,
que vous deviez devenir sœur ?
J'ai senti Son amour.
- C'est comment l'amour de Dieu ?
- Vous le saurez quand il viendra.
J'en doute.
Vous devez prononcer des vœux, non ?
Obéissance, pauvreté, chasteté.
À la fin de la journée,
vous rentrez chez vous et votre lit est vide.
Il n'est pas vide.
J'avais oublié.
Dieu vous y attend.
Vous êtes la femme du Christ.
Oui.
Quand même, il doit y avoir des nuits
où l'amour de Dieu est bien froid.
Quand vous êtes seule, vous devez vous
demander si vous avez fait le bon choix.
Est-ce...
- Les visites. Mon ex vient me voir.
- Elle est très belle.
Vous parlez de Kitty. Ma première femme.
Aujourd'hui, c'est Angélique.
- Combien d'ex-femmes avez-vous ?
- Trois.
Quatre, en comptant Bonnie.
Je l'ai épousée deux fois.
J'ai été mariée, vous savez.
Vous m'étonnerez toujours.
J'aimerais en savoir plus la prochaine fois.
La prochaine fois,
on parlera de vous, d'accord ?
J'ai hâte.
J'aime être dans la même pièce que vous,
ma sœur.
Vous avez une bonne aura.
Mon Dieu.
En manque ?
Je connais.
Voilà ce qu'il faut faire.
- Allez, parle.
- De quoi ?
- N'importe quoi.
- J'sais pas, mec.
Tu sais, quand j'étais en manque,
j'ai essayé de comprendre
pourquoi je me droguais, me détruisais.
Et alors ?
Qui t'as fait ça ?
Ton père.
Mon premier soir ici,
il m'a marqué au fer.
Et puis, il m'a humilié.
Il m'a fait mal.
Très mal.
Il faut que je te dise, Andrew.
Je hais ton père.
Toi et moi, on n'est pas très différents.
On n'est pas obligés, tu sais.
On n'est pas obligés de se droguer.
De se tuer pour se venger de ce salaud.
Il ne mérite pas d'avoir
ce genre de contrôle sur notre vie.
J'étais seul quand j'étais en manque.
J'étais un gosse.
Je voulais ma maman.
Je voulais les bras de ma maman.
Ma mère me manque aussi.
Je sais.
Viens. Ça va aller maintenant.
Ça va bien se passer.
- Venez.
- Désolés, on est en retard.
C'est rien.
Je voudrais m'excuser auprès de vous tous
pour la façon dont je me suis conduit
la dernière fois.
Je suis un drogué...
et j'espère qu'avec votre aide à tous,
je vais pouvoir prendre
le contrôle de ma vie.
Je crois que je ne l'ai jamais eu.
Bienvenue, Andrew.
Ça va aller, mec.
- Bonjour, papa.
- Andrew.
Tu as réussi. Tu es désintoxiqué.
Ouais.
Comment t'as fait ?
Avec un peu de l'aide de Dieu
et de mes amis.
- Hé, Vern.
- Comment ça va ?
On est venus faire de la gym. Suer un peu.
Ils vont m'apprendre à lutter.
Bien. On va regarder ça.
Mets-toi à quatre pattes.
La tête haute.
Tu me cherches ?
Non.
Vraiment ?
Tu veux pas me remercier
de ce que j'ai fait pour lui.
L'avoir aidé à se désintoxiquer.
J'ai fait ce que tu n'as jamais pu faire.
J'ai sauvé la vie de ton gosse.
Va te faire foutre.
Il faut que tu changes d'attitude. Sinon,
je n'ai aucune raison d'être ton ami.
- Mon ami ?
- Ouais.
Si ce n'est pas pour ce que j'ai fait,
alors, pour ce que je n'ai pas fait.
Quoi donc ?
Je l'ai pas enculé. Pas encore, du moins.
Parce que comme j'étais auprès de lui
quand il avait besoin de quelqu'un,
je l'ai consolé, tenu dans mes bras,
et je crois qu'il est un peu
tombé amoureux de moi.
J'ai été tenté d'au moins
lui rouler une pelle une ou deux fois,
mais je savais que ça t'embêterait,
alors j'ai rien fait,
même s'il veut
que je lui colle ma bite dans le cul.
J'ai bien peur qu'un de ces soirs,
lui et moi, seuls dans notre cellule,
je puisse plus me contrôler.
Tu seras mort avant d'en avoir l'occasion.
Fais vite. Keller commence à s'exciter
et O'Reily parle d'une partouze
avec Cyril et Andy.
Il faut que je te parle.
- Vas-y.
- Là-bas.
Andy, je suis très fier de toi.
De t'être désintoxiqué comme ça. J'espère
que maintenant, toi et moi,
on va avoir de meilleurs rapports.
Quoi ? Tu veux dire se rapprocher ?
En vrais père et fils ?
Oui.
Tu peux courir.
Je retourne avec mes amis.
Ce ne sont pas des hommes
que tu devrais fréquenter.
Contrairement à qui ?
Aux individus courageux
de ton joyeux petit groupe ?
Je vais te dire un truc.
Toute ma vie, tu m'as mis dans le crâne
que les Blancs étaient supérieurs.
Pour moi, ce n'est pas vrai.
Quand je regarde dans cette pièce,
je vois des visages blancs,
des noirs et toutes les nuances
entre les deux
et la seule chose dont je suis sûr,
c'est qu'on est tous de la merde.
La merde, ça n'a pas de degrés. Blanche
ou noire, la merde, c'est de la merde.
Alors j'en ai rien à foutre de tes idéaux,
de ce que tu représentes et de toi.
Je t'interdis de me parler comme ça !
Tu m'as trop frappé
quand j'étais gosse, salaud !
Reculez, bordel !
- Salaud de menteur ! Je t'emmerde !
- Emmenez-le au mitard.
Espèce de salaud !
Un homme fait tout pour ses enfants.
Il les nourrit,
s'inquiète pour eux...
sacrifie tout à leur bonheur.
- C'est quoi ?
- Petit cadeau de ton père.
Mais quand votre propre chair,
votre sang vous renie,
vous n'avez pas d'autre choix
que de les renier.
Mon fils, Andrew, est mort à mes yeux.
Mon fils...
est mort.
Contrôle, ici radio 320. On a un problème.
Overdose d'un prisonnier.
Trop tard pour les secours.
Envoyez les gars de la morgue.
Ça a marché.
Ton plan a fonctionné à merveille.
Ouais.
<i>La pire journée,</i>
c'est celle où on se réveille
en comprenant
qu'on ne recevra jamais plus de lettre.
Votre famille n'en peut plus,
vos amis vous oublient,
même les correspondants bénévoles
commencent à abandonner.
Très vite, on ferait n'importe quoi
pour recevoir une enveloppe à son nom,
pour savoir qu'on existe encore,
qu'on compte encore...
même si c'est juste pour un concours.
La vie à Oz, ça craint. Et seul un idiot
ou un républicain vous dira le contraire.
Quoique le châtiment soit loin d'être
aussi tordu que du temps du Moyen Âge.
Un villageois qui avait trop bu,
le flic de l'époque l'obligeait
à porter une camisole,
un fût de whisky en fait, avec des trous
pour la tête, les bras et les jambes !
<i>Puis il devait rester
sur la place du village</i>
<i>où les gens venaient l'insulter.</i>
Hé, le demeuré ! Ça va être ton tour.
Ne t'arrête pas. Laisse pisser.
Allez. Frappe.
Flanc, tête. Allez, détruis-le.
Pancamo va être dur à battre.
Il cogne dur,
il encaisse bien et est très vicieux.
Tout ce que ton frère a pour lui,
c'est sa rapidité.
- Ça n'a pas l'air de t'inquiéter.
- Je crois en lui.
C'est bien de croire en lui.
Mais je vais miser sur Pancamo.
- Cudney.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- De corvée à l'infirmerie aujourd'hui ?
- Oui.
Super. J'ai besoin que tu piques
encore un peu de chloral hydraté
- et que tu le planques juste là.
- Non.
On s'était entendus là-dessus, non ?
Tu tires de la came de l'infirmerie pour moi
- en échange de biffetons.
- Ce n'est pas bien de voler.
Je me suis confessé devant mes frères
aujourd'hui et j'ai promis de ne plus pécher.
Entendu. J'irai pêcher un autre poisson
en Terre sainte.
J'ai compris ce que tu faisais
du chloral hydraté.
Tu le fais boire aux boxeurs
pour qu'ils perdent le combat.
Tu délires.
J'ai demandé à voir le directeur
pour l'en informer.
Mon âme est en péril. La tienne aussi.
En te dénonçant, je te sauve.
Sauf si je te sauve en premier.
J'ai pas beaucoup de temps.
On dit que tu es le tueur à gages le plus
féroce de New York. Ce qui n'est pas rien
quand on sait que tous les mafieux russes
sont les pires des tarés.
J'ai un service à te demander, à faire
vite fait bien fait. Tu m'arrêtes, d'accord ?
97B752.
98B526.
99B131.
99C124.
99C124 !
Cudney !
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Je sais pas.
Cudney, sors de là !
Merde, regarde tout ce sang.
- Il est mort.
- Mate ces deux petites entailles.
Poignardé dans la nuque.
Yuri, faut que tu comprennes.
On n'est plus en Russie,
ni dans Little Odessa.
Les Siciliens veulent savoir
La ferme !
Sale Juif pleurnichard.
De ce côté, Chucky Pancamo l'Exécuteur.
Remets-le.
Sans les casques !
Allez, gros bras.
Boxez !
Il veut pas boxer.
Allez, Cyril.
Allez, vas-y. Pense tactique.
Putain, mais je rêve !
Te laisse pas impressionner
par ce rital de mes deux. Tu vas l'avoir.
Ça va ? Tu te sens bien ?
Qu'est-ce que je disais ?
Aie confiance en toi.
Quand tu es dedans, si tu y mets du tien,
tu peux soulever des montagnes, Cyril.
Tiens l'argent que je te dois
pour avoir parié sur Pancamo.
- Sacré combat.
- Merci.
Cyril, tu me laisses seul à seul
avec ton frère une minute ?
Descends. Ton émission préférée
va commencer.
- Ferme la porte, s'il te plaît.
- D'accord.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
J'ai cru comprendre que Yuri Kosygin
t'avait rendu un petit service.
- Un service ?
- Kosygin est dangereux.
Imprévisible et peu fiable.
Il dit qu'il va l'ouvrir
au sujet de la mort de Cudney.
Il a tué Cudney ?
Ryan, je suis là en ami.
Je suis sérieux,
il faut se débarrasser de Kosygin.
On a un vieux dicton dans ce pays.
Tu l'as peut-être déjà entendu.
"Faut pas faire chier un chieur."
Tu veux voir Kosygin mort. Tu débarques,
tu me dis qu'il est prêt à faire des vagues.
Tu espères que je vais lui régler
son compte à ta place. Tu rêves.
Tu me plais vraiment, O'Reily.
Alors écoute-moi bien : suis mon conseil.
Tu veux la peau de Yuri ?
Parles-en aux Siciliens.
Aux Siciliens ?
- Je peux ?
- Oui, entre.
On a discuté au sujet de Yuri Kosygin
y a pas longtemps.
Je le trouve très impertinent.
Il est aussi...
J'avais misé sur toi.
J'ai perdu gros. Il a gagné gros.
Il m'a avoué avoir mis de l'héroïne
dans ton eau
pour te... comment on dit...
te baiser la gueule.
J'en étais sûr ! Putain, je le savais !
- J'espère que tu m'en veux pas.
- Non. Je te remercie.
Et même, je te revaudrai ça.
- Faut qu'on refasse le combat.
- C'est ça.
- On m'a drogué.
- Tu peux le prouver ?
Faites une prise de sang.
Je vais pas perdre
du temps ou de l'argent pour ça,
tu n'aimes pas perdre, c'est tout.
Maintenant, dégage !
Allez, il a été clair,
il me semble. On y va.
- Mauvaise idée, mec.
- Quoi ?
Moucharder Kosygin auprès des matons.
- Si Kosygin y passe, ils penseront à toi.
- C'est vrai.
Je sais que tu as les boules
que mon frère t'ait battu, pas vrai ?
Mais puisque je suis fair-play,
je vais te donner un conseil.
Et lequel ?
À défaut de liquider un gars,
autant l'envoyer croupir au mitard.
Ou encore mieux, dans le couloir de la mort.
Quand Kosygin apprendra que Stanislofsky
l'a balancé, ton problème sera résolu.
Au XVIIe siècle, les mouchards
et les colporteurs de ragots avaient la tête
prise dans un casque en fer
qui empêchait tout mouvement.
Devant, une plaque de métal
recouverte de pointes...
leur rentrait dans la bouche.
S'ils voulaient parler...
Vous voyez.
De quoi vous réduire au silence.
On est aux États-Unis maintenant, Nikolaï.
- Parlons leur langue.
- D'accord. Parlons anglais.
Contrairement à toi, en Russie,
je n'étais pas un criminel.
J'étais enseignant.
À la chute du régime,
la vie est devenue si horrible à Moscou
que j'ai décidé de partir,
de venir aux États-Unis.
Dans l'espoir d'une vie meilleure, hein ?
Oui, pour ma femme et moi.
Mais notre vie ne s'est pas améliorée.
Impossible d'enseigner.
Ça a dû être terrible.
J'ai trouvé un boulot qui consistait
à peindre la maison de Leonid Rodzinsky.
- Un ponte de la mafia.
- Exact.
Il me traitait comme de la merde,
s'amusait à me ridiculiser.
Il m'appelait "professeur"
et m'obligeait à nettoyer ses toilettes.
Un jour, il m'a littéralement botté le cul
devant ma femme.
Je l'ai étranglé sur-le-champ.
- C'est l'heure de fermer ?
- Oui.
Bon, je m'en vais.
Attends la fin de mon histoire.
Bizarre. D'habitude, tu parles jamais.
Et là, on ne t'arrête plus.
Il faut me laisser
le temps de m'acclimater.
Je me sens très proche de toi.
J'ai été dévoré par le remords
suite à la mort de Rodzinsky,
mais j'y ai gagné la réputation
d'être sans pitié.
La mafia m'a engagé pour que
je les débarrasse d'un autre gars.
- La deuxième fois, j'ai trouvé ça facile...
- Yuri, pitié.
Je veux pas savoir.
La troisième fois, aucun problème.
- Yuri, je t'en supplie.
- Au dernier bilan, j'en étais au moins à 49.
- Tu as l'honneur d'être mon cinquantième.
- Non !
Non, attends là !
Gardien !
Donnez-moi son dossier médical,
il me faut son groupe sanguin.
On le met sous intraveineuse, il a besoin
de points et donnez-lui 50 mg de Demerol.
- Ne bouge pas.
- Non, pitié.
Sans rancune ?
À propos de quoi ?
LA DISCIPLINE
- Nooter est pédé.
- Pourquoi tu dis ça ?
- Mate comment il est toujours sur Pecky.
- Ils se battent.
Tout ce que j'ai à dire,
c'est qu'ils se touchent souvent.
J'ai jamais entendu un truc aussi con,
une marionnette homo.
- Un des Télétubbies est homo.
- Quoi ?
J'ai entendu le télé-évangéliste Falwell
dire que Twinky Dink ou je sais plus quoi,
est une tantouse.
C'est débile !
Faut avoir une bite pour être homo.
Les Télétubbies ont pas de bite.
Les marionnettes non plus.
Depuis quand il faut une bite
pour être homo ?
Si tu as une bouche,
tu peux sucer des bites.
- Hernandez veut te voir.
- Ça marche.
Alvarez, qu'est-ce que je dis toujours
sur notre ami O'Reily ici présent ?
- Qu'il est pas con.
- Exact, il est pas con.
- Je te renvoie le compliment.
- Ah oui ?
Alors pourquoi tu fais tout
pour que je pense le contraire ?
Tu sais qu'Adebisi et moi,
on bosse avec les Siciliens.
C'est nous qui dealons la dope ici, à Oz.
Oui, je sais.
Mais tu en vends quand même.
C'est pas vrai ?
Moi ? Non. Un tout petit peu, c'est vrai.
Mais on ne joue pas du tout
dans la même cour.
Je m'en fous. Arrête de suite.
Tu en as parlé avec Adebisi et Pancamo ?
Ma parole ne te suffit pas ?
Ça me suffit largement.
J'en vendrai plus. Basta.
- Donne-nous ce que tu as.
- Tout de suite ?
- Je peux en garder pour moi ?
- Je sais que tu as arrêté.
C'est ça.
- Contre le mur.
- Quoi ?
- J'avais oublié que je l'avais.
- Sans blague.
- Terminé, O'Reily. Compris ?
- Oui, compris.
Vous voulez baiser Hernandez ?
C'est le moment ou jamais.
Hernandez, tourne-toi.
Vide tes poches.
Merci. Mettez-lui les menottes.
- Doucement, les gars. Putain !
- Allez, on y va.
Ça me fend le cœur de voir ça, Alvarez.
J'ai bien réfléchi.
Je veux voir ce que j'ai fait à Rivera.
Tu le verras, quand il sera
en face de toi.
Je l'ai agressé et je me suis cassé.
Je l'ai pas regardé droit dans les yeux.
Je veux voir ce que j'ai fait ce jour-là.
Je veux voir dans quel état
je l'ai laissé.
Tu veux voir une photo ?
Avant, je travaillais à l'hôpital,
et ils prenaient des photos
de tous les prisonniers qui arrivaient
bien amochés,
pour les tribunaux,
ou je sais pas trop quoi.
Je veux voir une photo de Rivera.
Miguel, je ne crois
que ce soit une bonne idée.
Vous m'avez demandé ce qui s'est passé
et je n'ai rien pu vous dire
parce que c'est le flou total,
je me souviens juste du bruit.
Tous les jours,
je me regarde dans ce putain de miroir
et je ne me reconnais pas.
Vous comprenez, c'est pas moi.
Je vois l'autre gars, celui qui a fait ça.
Et une photo changerait les choses ?
Je sais pas.
Aidez-moi à me débarrasser
de cet autre gars.
Aidez-moi...
à me retrouver.
Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
Vous voilà enfin.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Il faut que tout cela cesse.
- Dissuadez Eugène de venir ici.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
C'est ce que je craignais,
Ça ne fait que remuer la merde.
- Ça le rend fou.
- Allons dans mon bureau.
Il agit bizarrement.
Cela me surprend grandement.
Lorsque Eugène est avec moi,
il a l'air tout à fait calme.
Il a l'air de vouloir
rencontrer Alvarez et d'y être prêt.
Non ! Il joue la comédie, croyez-moi.
À la maison, il reste toujours prostré.
Il reste assis, il dit rien.
Vous êtes sûre
que c'est lui qui refuse de parler ?
Il craint peut-être que,
puisque vous êtes contre cette rencontre,
vous ne le souteniez pas.
Je ne vous permets pas de me dire ça.
J'ai toujours été là pour lui.
Quand il s'est fait opérer,
je suis restée à son chevet jour et nuit.
J'ai réaménagé la maison, ma vie entière !
J'en suis bien consciente.
Eugène m'a dit qu'il ne serait pas
là où il est sans votre soutien.
Il m'a aussi dit qu'il pensait au suicide.
- Pardon ?
- Afin que votre vie redevienne normale.
Oh mon Dieu !
Il y a des années de cela, j'étais mariée
puis mon mari a été assassiné.
Pendant très longtemps,
je me suis complue
dans le chagrin et la colère,
jusqu'à ce qu'il ne me reste plus que ça.
Eugène sait qu'il n'a plus
que deux possibilités :
avancer ou mourir.
Vous avez été là jusqu'à présent.
Continuez à lui apporter votre soutien.
On amène Ponoma sur la jetée.
Il sait ce qui va lui arriver.
Il reste stoïque et calme.
Je lui dis : "Mon gars,
"tu as vraiment des couilles."
Et je les lui explose.
- Putain, qui tu es, toi ?
- Nat Ginsberg. Ton nouveau coloc.
Bon, le nouveau,
écoute-moi bien, sois bien attentif.
- Ceci est ma cellule. Tu ne fais qu'y dormir.
- Tu as un nom, gros dur ?
Nappa. M. Nappa.
- J'adore manger italien.
- Je suis pas pédé.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Je ne t'en tiendrai pas rigueur.
- Tu es écrivain ?
- Je travaille sur mes mémoires.
C'est toi, Antonio Nappa ? Le mafieux ?
Ça va être un sacré bouquin.
Tu cites des noms ?
Je cite des noms,
je décris les lieux et les crimes.
Tu n'aurais pas besoin d'un Boswell
par hasard ?
D'un secrétaire.
Pourquoi pas. C'est quoi ton nom, déjà ?
Nat.
C'est le diminutif de Nathaniel ?
Non, de Nathalie.
Vous avez un truc pour moi ?
Oui, il écrit un putain
de bouquin sur sa vie.
Apparemment, il dit absolument tout.
Il veut le bouquin.
Et qu'on se débarrasse de Nappa.
- Quelle merde.
- Tu l'as dit.
Pourquoi tu me tues pas ?
Kenny...
Tu sais, en Afrique,
les anciens de la tribu
apprenaient aux jeunes guerriers
non seulement à se battre
mais aussi comment mener leur vie.
C'est moi le chef de cette tribu.
Je vais t'apprendre à bien te conduire.
Tu es un dégénéré de première, Adebisi.
Ah, putain !
Première leçon : le respect.
Putain, je te respecte. Je t'assure.
Vraiment ? Habille-toi.
Faut qu'on aille préparer
le petit-déjeuner pour nos frères.
On a assassiné ta femme.
Tu découvres qu'elle te trompait.
Ça fait beaucoup d'émotions
à gérer d'un coup.
On a grandi dans le même quartier,
on est allés dans la même école,
dans le même collège.
Je devais l'accompagner au bal
de promo mais on m'a arrêté la veille.
J'avais loué mon costume,
acheté les fleurs pour elle.
Je m'en veux de lui avoir fait louper ça.
Il va falloir qu'on pense à autre chose :
ton fils.
Sa mère étant morte,
il va être dépendant de toi.
Il va vraiment avoir besoin d'un père.
Où vous voulez en venir ?
J'adore mon gamin.
Bien sûr. Mais il faudrait qu'on travaille
sur votre relation.
J'aimerais que tu suives
notre programme familial.
Que tu crées un lien durable avec ton fils
pour qu'à ta sortie,
il te connaisse vraiment.
Qu'en dis-tu ? Tu acceptes ?
Pourquoi pas.
Je suis prêt à tout pour lui.
- Salut, maman.
- Salut, comment ça va ?
- Salut.
- Dis bonjour à ton papa.
Jordan, viens ici.
Quoi de neuf ? Ça gaze ?
Tout va bien avec mamie ?
Pourquoi il fait
comme s'il ne me connaissait pas ?
- Ça fait un moment qu'il ne t'a pas vu.
- Prends ton temps.
Elle est gentille avec toi, mamie ?
Arrête, ne pleure pas. Arrête de pleurer !
Non, arrête de pleurer. Sois un homme !
Ça va aller.
Tout va bien, mon chéri.
Ça va aller, trésor.
- Où tu vas, Kenny ?
- J'ai des trucs à faire.
McManus essaie de t'embrouiller,
mon frère.
Tous les Blancs font ça.
Mais j'ai un plan, Kenny.
- Un moyen de détruire McManus.
- Ça nous avancera à quoi ?
On les oblige à mettre quelqu'un d'autre
à la tête de la cité d'émeraude.
- Qui sera aussi pourri.
- Qui sera des nôtres.
L'équipe des opérations spéciales,
on va simuler une évacuation de cellule.
À terre !
Bouge pas !
... le gouverneur dit
que le taux de criminalité a baissé
grâce à l'allongement
des peines de prison.
- Les opérations spéciales, ça vous tente ?
- Ils raffolent pas des femmes.
En plus, quand tu y entres,
ils t'enlèvent tout ce que tu as d'humain.
Tu crois pas que c'est nécessaire ?
On est censés entretenir un lien
avec les prisonniers
mais ces mecs-là,
ils doivent mettre un terme
à une situation de crise.
Je le sais bien et les en remercie.
Mais faut être sacrément dur
pour intégrer les opérations spéciales.
Et je ne le suis pas assez ?
Y a plus de sucrettes ?
Vous êtes tous devenus sourds ?
Ce que tu as fait à McManus,
c'est vraiment moche.
Ce que j'ai fait,
c'est lui tailler une pipe.
Et pour me remercier,
il m'a traitée comme de la merde.
Et tu l'accuses de harcèlement sexuel ?
C'est un affront
à celles qui ont été agressées.
Comme toi ?
Oui, comme moi.
Tu sais quel est ton problème, Diane ?
Tu veux être copine avec tout le monde.
Et tu sais quel est le tien ?
Vouloir être le pire cauchemar de nous tous.
Quelle surprise, les sucrettes.
Elle serait parfaite
pour les opérations spéciales.
O'Brien.
Bevilaqua.
Giles. Giles ?
Contrôle, ici Radio 24, renfort demandé.
Tiré et écartelé.
On attachait un homme à la queue
d'un cheval, on le traînait à la potence
et on attendait qu'il soit à moitié mort.
Ensuite, on le descendait, on l'ouvrait,
on l'éviscérait,
on lui brûlait les entrailles,
à ce moment-là, on lui tranchait la tête
et on coupait son corps en quatre.
Après tant d'abjection, le bourreau
tenait le cœur du mort en l'air et hurlait :
"Prenez garde !
Voici le cœur d'un traître !"
- Léo.
- Oui ?
Je voulais te parler de Clayton Hughes.
- Eh bien ?
- Euh...
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
- Rien.
J'ai parlé avec lui,
il a besoin de savoir si le meurtrier
de son père est toujours ici.
Il devrait laisser tomber.
Il est têtu, il s'obstine.
J'ai jeté un œil aux dossiers.
26 détenus étaient déjà ici il y a 17 ans,
ils ont peut-être vu quelque chose.
- Sache que je compte leur parler.
- À quoi cela t'avancera-t-il ?
On les a tous interrogés à l'époque.
Sans résultat.
Je ne dis pas
que je vais faire des découvertes.
Après tout ce temps,
quelqu'un est peut-être prêt à parler.
- Salut, Glo.
- Salut.
On m'a dit que Giles était chez toi.
Il a été victime d'une alerte cardiaque.
Je le garde en observation.
Est-ce qu'il peut parler ?
Il répond facilement par oui ou par non.
- Tu permets ?
- Vas-y.
Merci.
William, vous vous souvenez de moi ?
Je suis le père Mukada.
Comment vous sentez-vous ? Mieux ?
Oui.
J'avais l'intention
de venir vous voir au mitard.
Cela vous dérange
si je vous pose une question ?
Non.
Vous souvenez-vous, il y a 17 ans,
d'un gardien de prison, Samuel Hughes ?
Oui.
Vous vous rappelez
qu'il a été tué ici, à Oz ?
Oui.
Étiez-vous à la cafétéria
quand il a été tué ?
Oui.
Savez-vous qui l'a tué ?
Savez-vous qui a tué Samuel Hughes ?
Si je parle, je suis mort.
Non. Je vous promets que non.
On vous remettra au mitard,
aucun détenu ne pourra vous approcher.
Non.
J'ai rencontré un jeune homme,
le fils de Samuel Hughes, Clayton.
Il a besoin de savoir qui a tué son père.
Tous les autres prisonniers
qui étaient là à l'époque
refusent de me dire quoi que ce soit.
William, je vous en prie.
Quel est le prisonnier
qui a tué Samuel Hughes ?
- Non. C'est pas un prisonnier.
- Comment ça ?
Qui alors ?
Léo Glynn.
Radio 320, on a un problème ici.
Une overdose.
Trop tard pour les secours.
Envoyez les gars de la morgue.
- Bonjour, Glen.
- Si on veut.
Tout est si tranquille.
Si seulement ça pouvait durer.
Avec le fils de Schillinger
qui a fait une overdose.
On m'a dit.
Je croyais qu'Andrew était au mitard.
- Il y était.
- Comment il a eu de la drogue ?
Ça me dépasse.
- Glynn enquête ?
- Oui, mais dans la plus grande discrétion.
Ça n'a pas l'air de le préoccuper
plus que ça. À demain.
QUARTIER B
Tu tiens le coup, Vern ?
J'ai connu un gars
qui était devenu manchot.
Il me racontait que dans ses rêves,
il avait toujours ses deux bras.
Tous les matins, il se réveillait
et devait toujours se faire à l'idée
qu'il n'avait plus qu'un bras.
Tous les matins, c'était comme le jour
où on lui avait dit qu'il avait perdu un bras.
Mon fils est mort.
Ce que tu as fait, lui donner l'héroïne...
c'était la chose à faire.
Tu l'as mis à l'épreuve.
C'était un faible.
Pas un des nôtres.
Non.
Pour moi,
c'est comme si je l'avais euthanasié.
Keller et Beecher allaient le baiser
sur tous les plans.
En le tuant,
je l'ai sauvé.
Je vais demander à McManus
de me remettre dans ta cellule.
Fais pas ça.
Pourquoi ? Andy est mort.
On ne risque pas de le revoir de sitôt.
Toi et moi, Beecher.
Ôte ta main de là, s'il te plaît.
- Beecher.
- S'il te plaît.
Enlève ta putain de main de là.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes, ducon ?
Tu voulais te venger de Schillinger.
Je t'ai aidé à le faire.
Tu as fait ça pour nous ?
Et comment !
Quand est-ce que tu vas comprendre ?
Toi et moi. Ça n'arrivera jamais.
Tu m'aimes, Toby.
Va te faire foutre.
Sœur Pete ! On se voit aujourd'hui, non ?
À 15 h. Une de vos ex-femmes est là ?
- Oui.
- Laquelle ? Kitty ou Angélique ?
Bonnie. La numéro deux et quatre.
C'est ma reine.
La voilà, juste là.
- Une rousse.
- Non, l'autre.
- Chris, elle est...
- Énorme.
Elle a grossi après votre divorce ?
Non, elle était comme ça
quand on s'est mariés. Les deux fois.
Salut.
Vous aviez quel âge en prison,
à Lardner, avec Schillinger ?
17 ans.
Il vous a sauvé la vie ?
- Vous avez eu des rapports sexuels ?
- Oui.
Il vous y a obligé ?
Vern aime être le dominant,
alors je l'ai laissé y croire.
- Vous aimez coucher avec un homme ?
- J'aime le sexe. Pas vous ?
Vous m'avez dit que vous étiez mariée
avant de devenir sœur.
Vous vous éclatiez au lit
avec votre mari ?
Je suis sûr que oui. Je parie
que vous étiez une vraie tigresse.
Une peluche.
Ça vous manque pas ? Le sexe ?
- Mon mari me manque.
- Bien sûr.
Vous avez couché
avec un autre homme que lui ?
Chris.
Vous savez,
dès qu'on a une séance ensemble
et qu'il y a un sujet qui vous gêne,
vous détournez la conversation sur moi.
Vous avez remarqué ?
Je veux juste savoir la vraie raison
qui vous a poussé
à faire ce que vous savez à Beecher.
Vous avez vu mon ex, Bonnie ?
Quand je l'ai rencontrée, elle se sentait
très seule, elle était très malheureuse.
Alors je savais qu'elle tomberait
facilement amoureuse de moi.
Mais ce que j'ignorais,
c'était si après lui avoir brisé le cœur,
elle m'aimerait toujours.
Parce que je suis une vraie raclure.
Un moins que rien.
Le pire de tous.
Et que quelqu'un continue à m'aimer,
quoi que je fasse...
Vous êtes contente ?
Vous avez réussi à me faire parler,
à tout vous déballer.
Une sacrée avancée.
Donc vous vous êtes accroché à Beecher,
pas au nom de la fraternité aryenne,
mais pour voir s'il finirait
par vous aimer, quoi qu'il arrive.
Au début, c'est un abandon total
que je voulais.
Après, j'ai voulu un amour inconditionnel.
Mais Beecher ne m'aime pas.
Et ça vous dérange profondément.
Oui.
"Et pardonne-nous nos offenses
"comme nous pardonnons aussi
à ceux qui nous ont offensés.
"Et ne nous soumets pas à la tentation,
mais délivre-nous du mal.
"Car c'est à Toi qu'appartiennent..."
- Cette salle a été réservée.
- Je sais. Pour tes fidèles.
Pour notre lecture quotidienne.
Prends une chaise.
J'ai été élevé
dans l'Église épiscopalienne.
Ce qui se traduit par une pensée pour Dieu
une heure par semaine.
Mais toi, Il est toujours
dans tes pensées.
- Oui.
- Pourquoi ?
Je veux Le connaître.
Moi aussi.
Je veux Le connaître.
Je veux connaître Dieu.
Je veux que Lui me connaisse.
Qu'Il sache que je suis ici.
Que je suis toujours là.
Il le sait.
Quand je suis arrivé à Oz,
j'ai lu la Bible de la Genèse
à l'Apocalypse.
Très bonne lecture, la Bible.
Je peux t'emprunter ça ? Le Coran ?
Bien sûr.
Beecher...
aimerais-tu rester ?
- Écouter nos échanges ?
- Oui.
Prends une chaise.
Entrez, mes frères.
Qu'est-ce qui te prend, d'accepter
un non-croyant dans notre groupe d'étude ?
Un non-croyant ?
Tu veux dire "un Blanc".
Il n'est pas des nôtres.
Beecher est une âme en peine
à la recherche de la vérité.
Il a parfaitement le droit de venir
et de s'initier.
Non !
Ah non ?
Depuis mon arrivée ici,
je t'écoute justifier tes actes.
Tu n'es plus en droit d'être notre guide.
On a besoin d'un imam irréprochable.
Et qui ça va être, Khan ? Toi ?
Oui.
Ça n'arrivera jamais.
Nasim, suis-nous.
Oh, pauvre Said !
Alors c'est vrai ce qu'on m'a dit ?
Oui.
Je veux quand même
de ton enseignement religieux.
Je ne suis pas sûr d'en être capable.
Said est hors circuit.
Beecher est venu me demander
si je pouvais transférer Said dans sa cellule.
- Et tu lui as dit ?
- Que c'était bon.
Il faut qu'on organise une rencontre
avec celui qui le remplace.
- C'est qui ?
- Hamid Khan.
<i>Matricule 99K515, Hamid Khan.</i>
<i>Déclaré coupable le 6 mars 1999.
Pour voie de fait.</i>
<i>Une peine de 10 ans.
Mise en liberté conditionnelle dans 5 ans.</i>
Tu emménages chez les Blancs, Kareem ?
Hé, les tourtereaux...
Mon châtiment préféré de tous les temps ?
Ça s'appelle : "Le brame du cerf."
On mettait celui qui avait
le plus d'esprit sur une chaise,
et ses concitoyens le baladaient
à travers les rues
tandis qu'il faisait du bruit
et hurlait des vers licencieux
condamnant l'accusé.
Être la risée de tous,
être humilié devant les habitants
de votre communauté,
c'est peut-être le pire des châtiments.
"Connais-toi toi-même."
C'est ce que Socrate disait.
<i>Ou Aristote ou un de ces Blancs morts.</i>
Se connaître.
C'est ce qu'il y a de plus dur
pour chacun d'entre nous.
ÉVALUATION PSYCHIATRIQUE
...sauf que je me sentais coupable.
Ça avait donc quelque chose de catholique.
- Keller.
- Yo.
Je t'ai inscrit pour une séance
avec sœur Peter Marie à 10 heures.
- Ouais.
- Il est presque 10 heures.
Vous savez quoi, je veux pas y aller.
Je veux m'inscrire pour la gym.
Comme tu veux. Emmène-le.
Keller est parti ?
Il n'est pas venu.
C'est le deuxième rendez-vous qu'il rate.
- Il va bien ?
- Oui.
Il en a l'air. On ne parle pas beaucoup.
Quand vous parlez,
est-ce qu'il mentionne nos séances ?
Non.
Sœur Pete, vous allez bien ?
Oui.
- Tu mens.
- Je jure que c'est vrai.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a
entre toi et sœur Pete ?
Comment ça ?
T'as raté deux rendez-vous
et elle est dans tous ses états.
Je sais pas de quoi tu parles.
Si tu veux la faire chier, Keller,
je vais te faire chier.
Espèce de salope.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Il a ses machins.
On y va.
Miguel arrive.
Bonjour, Miguel. Merci.
Eugène et Tina Rivera. Miguel Alvarez.
Très bien.
Notre objectif est de mettre en place
un environnement de discussion.
Assieds-toi, Miguel.
De poser des questions et y répondre,
de partager vos expériences.
Quelques règles de base.
Je vais diriger cette rencontre.
Évitez d'interrompre l'autre.
Dites la vérité.
Pas de jurons.
Et surtout, écoutez.
Veux-tu commencer, Eugène ?
Je ne te vois pas, Alvarez.
Je te regarde en face
et je ne te vois pas.
Tu me vois ?
Quoi ?
Ouais.
Tu vois ma femme ?
Oui.
Tu as de la chance.
J'ai demandé à Tina de m'épouser
pour pouvoir me réveiller chaque jour
de ma vie en voyant son visage.
Mais
à cause de toi,
je ne le verrai plus jamais.
Tu sais quelque chose sur moi
que j'ignore ?
Une raison pour laquelle je méritais ça ?
Non.
Tu as pensé à ce que ça lui ferait ?
- Un peu.
- Un peu ?
Alors pourquoi tu m'as attaqué ?
Pas Metzger, ni Wittlesey, ni Glynn,
ni McManus, ni sœur Pete.
Moi, Alvarez. Pourquoi ?
- Réponds-lui, nom de Dieu !
- Tina.
Non. Il demande pourquoi.
Pourquoi on doit vivre avec ça ?
S'engueuler
sur le fait d'avoir ou non un bébé ?
On ne devrait pas s'engueuler
à ce sujet, putain.
Asseyez-vous, s'il vous plaît.
Oui, assieds-toi, chérie.
Tu vois, Miguel,
c'est pour ça qu'Eugène et Tina sont ici.
Dis-leur pourquoi c'est arrivé.
Je ne peux pas.
Une histoire de gang ?
Tu l'as fait à cause d'Hernandez ?
T'as gagné ta virilité
en me rendant aveugle ?
Ça a commencé comme ça, ouais.
Mais, vous savez, cet endroit...
Je déteste ce putain d'endroit.
Ce qu'il a fait à mon grand-père,
à mon père et à moi.
Je ne vous connais pas, vous savez.
J'avais rien contre vous.
C'était votre uniforme, mon frère.
<i>C'était de voir un hermano
dans cet uniforme, mec.</i>
Je veux récupérer mes yeux.
Je sais.
- Désolé.
- Tu es quoi ?
Je suis désolé.
Non ! J'ai dit que je voulais récupérer
mes yeux. Rends-les-moi.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Pourquoi ? Tu me les as pris.
- Pardonnez-moi.
- Va te faire foutre.
Miguel t'a posé une question.
Tu peux lui pardonner ?
- Pas aujourd'hui.
- D'accord.
On laisse la porte ouverte
à une autre rencontre, d'accord ?
Peut-être.
<i>Clark Kent est l'identité secrète
de Superman.</i>
J'ai jamais compris pourquoi Superman
avait besoin d'une identité secrète.
Si j'étais invulnérable,
si toutes les filles me couraient après,
pourquoi je me déguiserais en binoclard ?
<i>La vérité : Superman est schizophrène.</i>
Le ça de Superman s'oppose à son surmoi.
<i>Ce type vit un conflit,
ça ne fait aucun doute.</i>
- Bonjour, Chris.
- Bonjour, ma sœur.
- Je peux vous parler ?
- Oui. Allons par là.
Désolé pour ça.
Vous avez raté vos deux dernières séances.
Pourquoi ?
Depuis notre dernière séance,
où vous m'avez permis de m'ouvrir,
j'ai eu peur de revenir.
Peur de m'exposer encore plus.
La vérité, ma sœur,
c'est que je me déteste.
Raison de plus pour venir me voir.
Vous avez sans doute raison.
Vous savez ce que ça fait
d'avoir envie de quelqu'un ?
De désirer quelqu'un ?
Je ne parle pas de sexe.
Juste de toucher.
Oui.
Bien sûr, vous le savez.
Vous êtes psychologue,
vous êtes bonne sœur.
Mais vous êtes avant tout une femme.
Vous savez ce qu'est le désir.
- Tout va bien, ma sœur ?
- Oui.
- Je peux vous aider.
- Je sais. Parlez à Beecher.
Conseillez-le. Convainquez-le.
Je dois lui dire que vous l'aimez ?
Et qu'il vous aime ?
C'était juste pour ça, hein ?
Les séances, les questions
sur ma vie personnelle,
pour m'obliger à m'intéresser.
Pour que je vous aide à toucher Beecher.
Vous y arriverez. Il vous fait confiance.
Vous ne comprenez toujours pas ?
C'est tout le problème.
Il vous faisait confiance. Vous l'avez trahi.
Il ne peut plus vous faire confiance.
Oui, mais j'ai changé.
Vraiment ?
Vous m'avez manipulée
comme vous l'avez manipulé...
et je ne vous fais plus confiance.
Attendez.
Lâchez-moi.
Rien n'est plus à craindre, ma sœur ?
LÉONARD REIMONDO, 45 ANS, MUSICIEN
MÉCÉNE DES ÉTUDIANTS EN MUSIQUE
ASSASSINÉ
<i>Bénissez-moi, mon Père,
parce que j'ai péché.</i>
<i>La luxure était dans mon cœur.</i>
<i>Vous n'avez pas fait acte de luxure ?</i>
Non.
- Mais...
- Vous pourriez.
Non.
Alors ?
Cela a fait renaître
des sentiments en moi.
Des sentiments que je pensais
avoir contrôlés il y a longtemps.
Maintenant que je retrouve ces sentiments,
je ne crois pas devoir
les étouffer à nouveau.
Je dois à mon âme
d'être tout ce que je suis,
toutes les parties de moi.
Et alors ?
J'ai décidé de quitter le couvent.
De ne plus être religieuse.
Allez, rends-toi service.
On a trouvé l'héroïne
sur toi, dans ta poche.
Où l'as-tu eue ?
M'emmerde pas, Hernandez.
Je peux te redonner cinq ans
juste pour obstruction,
imagine ce que je peux faire
d'une accusation de possession.
Je dois parler à deux autres
de tes copains
et je parie qu'au moins un d'entre eux
préférera sauver sa peau que la tienne.
Faites-le sortir.
- Carlo, tu veux m'aider ?
- Vous aider ? Comment ?
Je sais que tu te prends pour un dur
comme Hernandez et Guerra,
mais je t'ai observé. Tu n'en es pas un.
Ta famille vient régulièrement.
Tu viens d'un meilleur quartier
que ces deux connards.
Je peux te faciliter la vie.
Où Hernandez se procure-t-il la drogue ?
Ramenez-le au mitard.
Tu ne reverras pas la lumière
avant d'avoir parlé.
Si je trouve ce que je cherche
grâce à un autre, tu ne la reverras jamais.
Je viens voir mon frère, Carlo Ricardo.
Non, désolée.
- C'est jour de visite, non ?
- Oui, mais votre frère est en isolement.
- C'est quoi ?
- Il a été séparé des autres.
On lui a retiré ses privilèges,
y compris ses droits de visite.
- Mais je dois le voir.
- Bien sûr. Mais pas aujourd'hui.
- Vous comprenez pas.
- Si j'avais eu 5 cents
à chaque fois que j'ai pas compris,
vous parleriez à une chaise vide.
- Où est votre supérieur ?
- J'essaie d'être aimable.
Je ne partirai pas
avant d'avoir parlé à un responsable.
À Oz, on n'apprécie
pas vraiment les ordres.
Je dois voir mon frère.
Il s'est fait prendre en train de dealer
et il refuse de parler,
on n'a donc pas d'autre choix
que de le garder au mitard.
- Je pourrais le voir là-bas ?
- Non, revenez quand il en sortira.
Vous ne comprenez pas. Il n'a que moi.
Luis disparaît pendant des jours.
Isabella n'arrête pas de pleurer.
Juan est un enfoiré.
Maman va de l'appartement au travail
et à l'hôpital.
- Désolé...
- J'ai trouvé un travail à Oakland.
Bien payé. Je dois le prendre
pour soutenir ma famille.
Je pars demain.
Je ne peux pas y aller et leur dire
que je dois rentrer voir mon frère en prison.
Ils ignorent que j'ai un frère en prison.
Je ne veux pas qu'il croie
que je l'ai abandonné, oublié.
Juste une minute, pour lui expliquer.
Juste une minute, promis.
Désolé.
Je ne peux pas. C'est impossible.
Mais vous pouvez lui écrire un mot
et je ferai en sorte qu'il l'ait.
Ça va le tuer.
Lopresti, je dois partir.
Rends-moi service
et apporte ça à Carlo Ricardo au mitard.
- D'accord.
- Merci beaucoup. À demain.
Depuis quand tu transmets des messages
à cet enfoiré de latino ?
Ouais, fait chier.
Tu fais plus le malin, hein ?
- Bonjour, Roger.
- Lenore.
- Ça faisait longtemps.
- Vous avez l'air en forme.
Merci. Je dépose juste Clayton
et je voulais saluer Léo.
- Il devait nous retrouver ici.
- Ma voiture est toujours au garage.
Clayton est gêné.
- Mais non, maman.
- Ça va.
Content de vous voir
et d'avoir Clayton avec nous.
Mon Dieu.
C'est si bizarre de revenir ici.
Oui, j'imagine.
J'ai dit à ta femme que je ne pensais pas
pouvoir passer cette porte,
mais Clayton n'a jamais été aussi heureux.
- Il adore son travail.
- Maman.
J'ai quelque chose pour toi.
Je l'ai trouvé dans le grenier.
Toi et Sammy étiez si jeunes.
Eh oui.
Merci, Lenore.
Garde-la ici, près de ton cœur.
Et lui aussi, protège-le bien.
- Bien sûr. Ne t'inquiète pas.
- Au revoir.
- Bon anniversaire, Clayton.
- Bon anniversaire ?
- Je l'ai.
- Je ne les trouve pas.
- C'est le tiroir de gauche.
- D'accord.
Non.
Pas de gâteau d'anniversaire sans bougies.
- Je vais en acheter en ville.
- Non, Hughes commence dans 10 minutes.
Tout le monde à la bibliothèque à midi.
C'est une super idée, Diane,
d'organiser cette fête pour Clayton.
Oui, je plains ce gosse.
Un, parce que je sais ce que c'est
de commencer ici
quand les autres pensent
qu'on n'a pas les couilles. Deux, son père.
J'ai fait des recherches
sur les circonstances
de la mort de son père.
- T'as trouvé un truc ?
- J'ai parlé à William Giles
qui était dans la cafétéria
quand Hughes s'est fait poignarder,
et il dit...
Je ne sais pas si je dois le croire ou pas.
Si je le crois, je ne sais pas quoi faire.
Si je fais quelque chose,
qui sait ce qui se passera.
Tu délires.
Il dit que Sam Hughes
a été poignardé par Léo.
Léo qui ? DiCaprio ?
- Glynn.
- Léo Glynn ?
- Oui.
- Giles délire.
Je sais. Je refuse d'y croire,
puis je me dis
que c'est peut-être pour ça
que le meurtrier n'a pas été identifié.
Quelque chose me dit
que Léo n'a jamais dit toute la vérité.
Pourquoi pas un cierge ?
- Quoi ?
- Pour le gâteau.
On peut voler les cierges de messe ?
Oui, je crois. Je vais en chercher.
On se retrouve à la bibliothèque.
Si tu as des doutes sur Léo,
tu dois le lui dire.
Léo, tu as une minute ?
- Oui. Viens avec moi.
- D'accord.
Comme je te l'ai dit,
je parle de Sam Hughes aux gens.
Qu'as-tu trouvé ?
Tu as découvert quelque chose ?
- Peut-être. William Giles.
- Ce cinglé ?
À mon avis, il n'est pas cinglé,
il craint plutôt d'être sain d'esprit.
- Et il dit... Eh bien, il dit...
- Quoi ?
... que tu as tué Sam Hughes.
Léo, tu as parlé à Clayton
de ce qui s'est passé.
Tu lui as dit la vérité.
Mais s'il y a autre chose à dire,
il a le droit de l'entendre,
même si c'est dur pour toi de le dire.
Bon sang, Ray.
Je ne te dois pas d'explication.
Non, c'est vrai.
Mais à Clayton, si.
C'est comme une confession.
Elle doit être faite une fois
et seulement à celui qui peut t'absoudre.
Sors de mon bureau.
- C'est l'heure d'ouvrir.
- Vas-y, on a presque fini.
- Merci pour tout, Diane.
- De rien.
Promets-moi de ne pas fêter
mon anniversaire.
- Hé, O'Reily !
- "Hé" quoi ?
Ton frère se bat comme une fille.
Ah oui ? Tu veux te battre contre lui,
mon pote ?
- Contre toi et ton frère.
- Toi et quelle putain d'armée ?
Ça suffit !
- Me parlez pas. Parlez à votre frère.
- Assieds-toi.
- Je suis pas venu m'asseoir.
- Assieds-toi.
Vous allez me donner une fessée ?
- Vous avez un problème ?
- Ôte tes mains...
Putain de merde !
Ça va.
Non.
- Elle va bien ?
- Quelques points, une légère commotion.
- Qu'est-ce qui t'a pris ?
- J'essayais de maintenir l'ordre.
D'après ce que je sais,
il n'y avait pas grand-chose à maintenir.
- Je t'ai déjà prévenu.
- Quoi, tu vas me virer ?
Assieds-toi.
Je veux te parler du jour
où ton père est mort.
<i>Ton père et moi étions de service.</i>
<i>Quand je suis arrivé à Oz, j'ai décidé</i>
<i>de traiter chaque situation
selon le pire scénario possible.</i>
<i>Sam n'était pas aussi bête</i>
<i>et il a essayé de me retenir. Il a essayé.</i>
Mais j'étais trop jeune,
trop déterminé,
trop stupide.
<i>Une bagarre a éclaté.</i>
<i>J'ai glissé sur le sol.</i>
<i>J'étais sonné, je perdais le contrôle.
Et tout mon courage s'est envolé.</i>
<i>Ton père a dû s'en mêler.</i>
Ça va ?
<i>Il est tombé juste à côté de moi.</i>
<i>Je ne savais pas ce qui se passait.</i>
<i>Et puis d'autres gardiens sont arrivés.</i>
<i>Je l'ai tenu jusqu'à la fin.</i>
Dans mes bras,
à cause de ma stupidité.
- Ça va ?
- Oui, ça va.
Sauf que je dois rentrer
et que ma fille va me voir comme ça.
Quand on m'a dit que tu étais blessée,
je suis devenu fou.
- Tim, arrête.
- Quoi ?
D'être honnête ?
J'ai réfléchi ou j'ai ressenti...
Je sais que j'ai tout essayé.
Mais on pourrait réessayer. Ensemble.
Si je n'avais pas cette bosse sur la tête,
je penserais que c'est plus politique
que romantique.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Mais ce sont les tourtereaux.
Je connaissais un type
qui bossait à Wall Street
et portait un soutien-gorge et une culotte
sous son costume.
Chaque jour, il était en réunion,
prenait d'importantes décisions,
signait des contrats.
Mais en dessous, il se sentait joli.
Oh, si joli.
Fin
- Terminé.
- Et ?
Croyez-moi, M. Nappa,
et je ne suis pas du genre à exagérer,
<i>mais ce sera le meilleur roman inspiré
d'un fait divers depuis De sang-froid.</i>
Vraiment. Je ne l'ai jamais lu.
C'était terrifiant. Celui-ci est mieux.
On va envoyer ça
à l'agent littéraire immédiatement.
Sois prudent. Si un autre mafieux découvre
que j'ai écrit sur la Mafia, on est morts.
Je serai prudent.
Pour fêter ça, je vais faire à dîner.
Et je pense qu'on devrait se faire beaux.
- S'il vous plaît.
- On verra.
Gardien, je ne me sens pas bien.
Est-ce que je peux aller aux urgences ?
Donne-la-lui.
Ton ami va s'occuper
de cet autre problème pour moi, hein ?
Enfoiré de mouchard.
- Je suis trop habillé ?
- Seigneur.
- Tu ressembles beaucoup à mon ex-femme.
- Merci.
C'est pas un compliment.
- Asseyez-vous.
- C'est beau.
- Servez.
- Du vin.
Vous n'êtes pas le seul
à pouvoir vous procurer des choses.
Tiens.
Pour moi.
À votre livre, à votre vie
et à la fin réussie des deux.
- Je ne suis pas encore mort.
- Non, c'est vrai.
Très bon.
À son époque,
Antonio Nappa était un grand homme.
Il était comme un père pour moi.
- Plutôt comme un oncle.
- Extinction des feux !
Les citoyens de Gotham City
étaient les plus grands crétins de la terre.
<i>Batman et Robin les sauvaient</i>
<i>de l'Homme Mystère, du Joker, etc.</i>
<i>Ils avaient le millionnaire Bruce Wayne
et son pupille Dick Grayson,</i>
<i>à la une chaque jour.</i>
Batman et Robin. Bruce et Dick.
Vous voulez dire que personne
n'a pu faire le rapprochement ?
Je veux voir le directeur.
- Pourquoi ?
- C'est mes affaires.
Adebisi, tu devrais savoir
que tes affaires sont mes affaires.
- Je veux porter plainte.
- Contre ?
Tim McManus.
Tu accuses McManus
de harcèlement sexuel ?
Exact.
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a fait ?
Pas à moi. À Kenny Wangler.
Hier, il a touché le pénis de Kenny.
Gardien,
faites entrer Wangler.
Assieds-toi.
C'est une grave accusation.
- Et si je découvre que tu mens...
- Je mens pas.
À toi d'en apporter la preuve.
J'ai déjà été obligé de gérer
des types qui me tripotent.
J'étais pas bien dernièrement,
j'étais triste et tout ça.
McManus a mis son bras
autour de mon épaule comme un ami,
sauf que c'est pas comme un ami.
J'allais laisser tomber l'affaire
mais Adebisi m'a dit : "Fais pas ça."
Il dit que ce qui se passe
entre prisonniers, c'est une chose,
et que ce qui se passe avec McManus,
c'en est une autre.
- Il a dit quoi ?
- Que tu l'avais tripoté.
C'est des conneries.
J'ai essayé de le réconforter.
Tu ne prends pas ça au sérieux, hein ?
Claire Howell t'accuse
de harcèlement sexuel.
- Mais elle ment, elle aussi.
- Ouais.
J'aimerais savoir quand ça cessera.
Quand ça cessera d'être
le problème des autres.
- Tu me prends pour un obsédé sexuel.
- Tu l'es peut-être.
Depuis que tu es arrivé à Oz,
je t'ai vu passer de lit en lit.
J'ai rien dit, même si je trouvais
que ce que tu faisais était dégueulasse.
Wangler ment.
Probablement. Mais il y a peut-être
d'autres détenus qui n'ont jamais parlé.
Tu sais quoi, j'en sais rien.
Et je ne sais pas comment le découvrir.
Mais si c'est vrai,
tu seras viré.
- Rick Donn ?
- Oui.
Je suis un fan de votre émission.
Très efficace.
Merci. Vous avez dit
avoir une histoire pour moi ?
Oui. Une histoire de sexe.
Que dites-vous de cette accusation
de harcèlement sexuel ?
Sortez de mon bureau !
<i>Exclusivité : Channel 2 News
a appris que Tim McManus,</i>
<i>responsable du Centre
de détention d'État d'Oswald</i>
<i>a été accusé de harcèlement sexuel
sur des détenus</i>
<i>et des gardiens de prison.</i>
<i>McManus a d'abord été accusé de
harcèlement par la gardienne Claire Howell.</i>
<i>Le procureur a confirmé
que l'affaire Howell se réglait à l'amiable.</i>
Bon sang, Mlle Sally.
Vous croyez que ses nibards sont vrais ?
Lls emmènent Wangler en cellule normale.
- T'as appelé ton avocate ?
- Oui.
- Elle a dit quoi ?
- Soyez patient.
Continuez à vivre.
Agissez normalement.
Agir normalement,
c'est ce qui m'a mis dans la panade.
- Ça va aller.
- Ouais.
Bonjour, je suis Tim McManus.
Bonjour. J'apprécie que vous soyez venu
malgré votre emploi du temps
très, très chargé.
Pour dire vrai, je suis curieux de savoir
ce que vous me voulez.
Asseyez-vous.
- Vous voulez du thé ?
- Non.
- Je peux vous appeler Tim ?
- Oui.
Tim,
au cours des dernières semaines
j'ai reçu quelques chocs.
- Le meurtre de Richie Hanlon.
- Oui, nous enquêtons toujours.
Et hier, mon nouvel avocat,
qui est commis d'office
et que je n'aime pas du tout,
m'a dit que la Cour suprême de l'État
avait rejeté mon dernier appel.
Jeudi prochain est la date fixée pour...
l'exécution.
C'est la première fois
que je prononce ce mot :
"L'exécution."Mon exécution.
Le directeur m'a dit que je pouvais
choisir la façon dont je vais mourir
et j'espérais
que vous pourriez m'aider à choisir.
Moi ?
Richie a toujours dit du bien de vous.
Il disait que vous étiez un homme bon.
C'est vrai ?
Si vous deviez mourir,
quelle méthode choisiriez-vous ?
Je ne sais pas.
L'injection létale
est la moins douloureuse.
La douleur est un point
à prendre en compte.
- Le seul point à prendre en compte.
- Non.
Ma manière de mourir
doit avoir quelque chose de lyrique,
de significatif.
Il y a la chambre à gaz.
On dit que le gaz rend la peau verte.
Et la pendaison ?
Quand on meurt,
les pieds font une petite danse,
une petite danse de la mort.
Richie avait raison à votre sujet.
La pendaison, c'est parfait.
Je veux quitter cette vie en dansant.
Merci, gentil monsieur.
Vous savez, Richie était amoureux de vous.
Ah bon ?
Je comprends pourquoi.
Gardien.
Cette affaire de harcèlement
ne doit pas vous désespérer.
Vous êtes au courant ?
Même dans le couloir de la mort,
la rumeur court.
Sujet suivant, les gilets non perforables.
Diane ?
On sait que les attaques
sont en augmentation à Oz.
Une par heure, 10000 par an.
Ces gilets sont semblables aux gilets
en Kevlar des agents de police,
sauf qu'ils protègent
contre les lames et les balles.
Ils coûtent également 400 $ chacun.
Je n'ai pas cet argent dans le budget.
Vous connaissez la meilleure ?
Gloria Nathan vient d'examiner
Shirley Bellinger. Elle est enceinte.
Putain de merde.
Cyril, tu peux te poser ?
- Je boxe.
- Oui, je sais.
- O'Reily.
- Yo, doucement.
<i>C'est pas l'heure
de La classe de Mlle Sally ?</i>
- Non.
- Cyril, va attendre dehors, d'accord ?
S'il te plaît.
Tu parierais sur qui aujourd'hui,
Khan ou le pédé ?
Aucun. Je ne parie pas.
T'as parié sur le vainqueur à chaque fois.
Pourquoi tu paries pas aujourd'hui ?
Celui qui gagne aujourd'hui
se battra contre Cyril la semaine prochaine.
Je veux pas avoir la poisse.
Je te croyais pas superstitieux.
Je suis un homme de logique, je planifie.
J'étudie chaque détail,
je mesure chaque possibilité.
Et je tire à pile ou face.
Si tu pariais, tu parierais sur qui ?
D'accord.
Khan a la puissance et la discipline.
Tu dirais le musulman ?
- Cramer a la vitesse et le style.
- Le pédé, alors ?
Regarde cet attardé, Cyril !
Yo, Cyril.
Arrête !
- Arrêtez !
- Cyril, arrête !
Putain de taré.
- Arrête.
- Quoi ?
Je boxe.
Désolé, gardien Murphy.
Depuis qu'il a battu Pancamo,
il est un peu vif.
- Garde tes coups pour le ring, d'accord ?
- Oui, monsieur.
Surveille ton frère, O'Reily, vu ?
Faudrait pas qu'il soit disqualifié
du championnat
parce qu'il a atterri au mitard.
Qu'est-ce qui t'a pris ?
Quand je boxe, les gens m'acclament.
- Oui ?
- J'aime ça.
Je n'ai plus peur.
C'est bien, mais tu ne dois pas
te battre tout le temps.
- Non ?
- Non.
Mais toi, tu le fais.
L'homme avec lequel tu vas te battre
représente ce que notre foi rejette
en termes de désir sexuel.
Ta victoire sur Jason Cramer
sera une victoire pour la pureté.
Pour la droiture.
Pour Allah.
Salut, les gars.
Tire-toi. On est en plein groupe d'étude.
J'ai peut-être envie de connaître l'Islam,
qui sait ?
Sois sérieux.
Il s'est passé beaucoup de choses.
Beecher et Said.
Adebisi, va droit au but.
C'est simple. On a tous la même peau...
eux non.
Ne bats pas Cramer parce qu'il aime
les hommes, mais parce qu'il est blanc.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, Schillinger ?
Je veux que tu te concentres
sur autre chose que ta queue.
Tu sais, quand on était
dans le quartier B ensemble,
tu t'es jamais intéressé à moi.
Maintenant que je vais affronter
ce musulman, t'es mon meilleur pote.
Ça a dû être dur de décider
qui tu allais soutenir.
Voyons, la pédale ou le renoi ?
Mais tu sais mieux ce que c'est
de se faire sucer
que d'avoir une coupe afro.
Fais gaffe à ce que tu dis, Clochette,
ou Khan va gagner
par abandon de l'adversaire.
Tue ce sale Blanc !
Allez, t'es pas fatigué.
Bien joué. Super, Jason.
Ça suffit.
Sur les fiches des juges, Juge 1 :
30-29, Khan.
Ouais !
Pour le Juge 2 :
29-28, Cramer.
Et pour le Juge 3 : 30-29.
Vainqueur par décision à la majorité :
Hamid Khan.
Vous voyez ça ?
Toute leur vie les gens pensent savoir
qui ils sont.
<i>Mari, mère, fils, avocat, médecin,</i>
<i>livreur de pizza, baptiste, Juif,</i>
<i>musulman, Italien, Irlandais, WASP, Noir,</i>
<i>Blanc, Jaune, homme, femme.</i>
Puis il se passe quelque chose
qui détruit toutes les illusions
et on reste avec la vérité.
La vérité solitaire et terrifiante.
Beecher, tu es le garde du corps de Said.
En quelque sorte.
Pas vraiment.
Je veux le voir.
Des hauts et des bas,
la vie à Oz.
J'ai été roi, puis fou,
je suis à nouveau roi.
Félicitations.
Toi et moi, on voit le monde différemment.
Mais il y a quelque chose
que j'ai toujours admiré chez toi.
Pareil pour moi.
Tu es seul.
Mais ça peut changer.
Rejoins-moi.
- Je suis très honoré.
- Mais tu refuses.
- Ils vont te tuer, tu sais.
- Probablement.
Beecher ne peut pas te protéger.
Probablement pas.
Mais je suis prêt à faire le voyage
qu'Allah a choisi pour moi.
On n'a jamais pu avoir Said
à cause de ses putains de gardes du corps.
On doit les tuer, lui et Beecher.
- Je peux m'asseoir ?
- Non.
C'est idiot.
Vous avez besoin de soutien.
Je vous emmerde.
Tu es venu vers moi pour apprendre
à te rapprocher de Dieu
à cause de ton rôle dans la mort
d'Andrew Schillinger.
La culpabilité que tu portes
ne peut être allégée que par le pardon.
- Je veux être pardonné.
- Alors tu dois pardonner
à Schillinger et Keller.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Beecher, tu dois le faire.
Et toi ?
Tu ne dois pas pardonner à Hamid Khan ?
Reste ici.
La paix soit avec toi.
<i>As-salam'alaykoum, mes frères.</i>
Laissez-le entrer.
Que veux-tu, homme noir ?
Il y a cinq ans, j'étais très différent.
Égoïste, ambitieux,
manipulateur, arrogant.
Un jour, à la Mecque,
les paroles du Prophète, loué soit Son nom,
m'ont empli de la grâce
et de la gloire d'Allah.
Je n'ai voulu que montrer aux autres
les visions que j'avais eues,
les possibilités.
J'ai étudié,
je suis devenu professeur et leader,
mais malgré toutes mes bonnes intentions,
j'étais toujours égoïste,
ambitieux, manipulateur
et encore plus arrogant.
Ce qui s'est passé
au cours des derniers mois
m'a donné une leçon d'humilité.
Je suis devenu humble.
Mais pas grâce à toi.
Grâce à Dieu.
Dépourvu de tout le reste,
il ne me reste plus qu'Allah.
Et c'est plus qu'assez.
La paix soit avec toi, mon frère.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
Au nom d'Allah,
le magnifique et le miséricordieux,
j'ai vu qu'il n'y avait qu'un seul Dieu.
Allah, je confesse mes péchés.
Guide-moi dans le droit chemin.
Mes prières, ma vie, ma mort
sont toutes pour Allah.
Merde !
Une ERREUR s'est produite
Ça marche pas comme ça.
Putain.
J'ai adoré le spectacle de Said.
Je veux te parler.
Oui. Quoi ?
Said m'a beaucoup aidé à faire le point.
- Et...
- Chris ?
Je te pardonne.
Et je te demande de me pardonner.
Je t'aime.
Embrasse-moi.
Plus vite. Allez.
Concentre-toi. C'est important.
Plus vite.
- O'Reily, viens.
- Je suis occupé. Plus vite.
- Y a du fric à se faire.
- Continue à t'entraîner.
- Je veux que tu m'aides à tuer Said.
- Said ? Il n'est plus rien.
Je dois quand même trouver un moyen
de le détruire.
Sans que Beecher s'en doute, c'est ça ?
En fait, t'as rien à faire.
Il paraît que les Aryens vont tuer Said.
- Tu sais quand ?
- Je dirais tout de suite.
Tu vas croire que c'est des conneries,
mais je me sens mal
d'avoir participé à la mort d'Andy.
Je suis désolé.
Perdre un enfant,
il n'y a rien de pire.
Je veux me racheter.
Comment ?
Comment tu pourrais te racheter ?
Tu as un autre fils,
tu ne sais pas où il est.
Grâce aux détectives privés
de mon ancien cabinet, je peux le trouver.
Et ça te permettrait d'être quitte ?
On serait à égalité ?
C'est un début.
Beecher, t'es plus taré que je le croyais.
Une seule chose
pourrait régler le problème.
Ta mort.
À vos cellules !
Dépêchez-vous.
<i>Les gens se définissent par trois choses :</i>
<i>Leur tête,</i>
<i>leur façon de penser,</i>
<i>leur cœur,</i>
<i>ce qu'ils ressentent,</i>
<i>leur bite,</i>
<i>qui ils baisent.</i>
<i>Finalement, chacun d'entre nous
doit répondre à une question.</i>
<i>Une seule question, pas si simple.</i>
Qui suis-je ?
"C'était la nuit de Noël,
un peu avant minuit,
"À l'heure où tout est calme,
même les souris."
Les rats, par contre, c'est autre chose.
Un petit cadeau pour toi, Said.
- Bon, qu'y a-t-il ?
- J'ai été mordu par un rat.
Quelle horreur ! Vous pouvez prendre ça ?
Allongez-vous.
Veille de Noël.
Je crois qu'il neige.
Quand j'étais petit,
c'était le plus beau soir.
Une maison pleine de musique,
de lumières, de bonnes choses, de cousins.
- La cité d'émeraude est bien vide.
- Évidemment.
Chacun est enfermé dans sa cellule :
les Aryens ont attaqué les musulmans.
J'ai un pressentiment.
Comme avant, quand Dieu me parlait.
Dieu te parlait ?
- Il me disait ce qui allait arriver.
- Et là, Il te parle ?
Il te dit quoi ?
Il dit :
"Tremble."
<i>Miguel t'a posé une question.</i>
<i>Tu peux lui pardonner ?</i>
Hier, j'ai vu Eugène et Tina,
ils ont décidé
de ne pas continuer le programme.
Dommage.
J'avais un tas de choses à leur dire.
- Tu pourrais me les dire.
- Ce n'est pas pareil.
Évidemment. Je comprends.
Il y a des choses qu'on ne doit dire
qu'à certaines personnes,
le directeur par exemple.
Il attend que tu lui dises
qui a violé sa fille.
- Es-tu prêt à le faire ?
- Non.
- Miguel, veux-tu repartir en isolement ?
- Non.
Je te conseille donc
de prendre la journée
pour prier Dieu,
regarder en toi-même
et faire un choix.
Que Dieu vous bénisse, au nom du Père,
du Fils et du Saint-Esprit.
Allez dans la paix du Christ.
- Alléluia.
- Nous rendons grâce à Dieu. Alléluia.
- Joyeux Noël à tous.
- Joyeux Noël, Père.
<i>Yo, hermano.</i>
Il paraît que Glynn laisse Hernandez, Guerra
et Ricardo revenir à la cité d'émeraude.
- À ta place, je ferais gaffe à mon cul.
- Pourquoi ça ?
Je t'ai vu te tirer
quand ils se sont fait pincer.
<i>C'est pas très cool,
de lâcher tes amigos comme ça.</i>
Fous-moi la paix, bordel !
Hernandez va être de mauvais poil
et chercher à qui s'en prendre.
- Ma sœur va venir me voir.
- T'es sûr ?
Oui, elle sait à quel point j'aime Noël.
<i>- Miguelito, feliz Navidad.
- Où t'étais passé, mec ?</i>
Comment ça ?
Sur quatre, on n'est que trois
à s'être fait coffrer.
Allez, les gars. Recule-toi, mec.
Il faut leur pardonner, Miguelito.
Ils ont eu beaucoup de temps
pour se poser des questions.
Mais moi, je m'en pose pas.
Je sais.
T'es pas des nôtres.
Tu le seras jamais.
Pourquoi ça m'inquiète de vous voir
tous les quatre dans cette cellule ?
Ceux qui n'habitent pas ici, dehors.
On y va.
Hernandez, bon Dieu, c'est Noël.
Arrête un peu de jouer au dur.
Il a raison.
Profite de cette journée.
Ce sera ta dernière.
J'ai pris une décision.
Je dirai rien au directeur
sur le viol de sa fille.
Tu es sûr ? Tu as bien réfléchi ?
Je veux repartir en isolement.
Je vais m'en occuper.
Tu seras transféré demain matin.
- Non, pas demain. Tout de suite.
- Il faut du temps.
- Merde. Je veux y aller tout de suite.
- Pourquoi, tu es en danger ?
Si c'est le cas, on peut te mettre
en détention protectrice.
Qu'est-ce que ça change ?
Pourvu que je sois seul.
Je l'ai été toute ma putain de vie.
Y pas de place pour moi dans le monde.
Je suis seul.
Isolement.
- Elle vient ?
- Elle n'est pas sur la liste.
Revérifiez.
Ricardo, c'est déjà fait.
Ta sœur n'a pas prévu de venir.
Ni aucun membre de ta famille.
Carlo, c'est l'heure.
- Tu nous quittes, Alvarez ?
- Avant ça, on a un truc à te donner.
Mon premier jour ici, j'ai pris un coup
de couteau. Tu te rappelles, enfoiré ?
Lâche ça ! Tout de suite.
Ricardo est mort.
À vos cellules !
Allez ! On se bouge !
Joyeuses fêtes, enculé.
Alvarez est de nouveau en isolement.
La boucle est bouclée.
- Je suis désolée, Ray.
- Désolée ?
C'est une confession officielle ?
Je n'aurais pas dû t'exclure.
Si tu avais assisté aux séances
avec Alvarez et Rivera,
Ça aurait peut-être fini autrement.
J'en doute.
Une fois de plus,
l'enfant Jésus retourne dans sa boîte.
Et les Rois Mages :
Croquignol, Filochard et Ribouldingue.
Es-tu absolument décidée
à cesser d'être religieuse ?
En sortir est aussi difficile qu'y entrer.
Quand ce sera fini, qui sait ?
J'admire ton courage.
Il faut parfois autant de courage
pour rester
- que pour partir.
- Peut-être.
Mais si les Mages étaient restés en Perse
comme ils étaient censés le faire,
s'ils avaient suivi les règles,
ils n'auraient jamais vu Dieu.
Merci.
On m'a fait dire que tu voulais me voir,
que tu voulais parler
de l'agresseur d'Ardith.
Vous voulez savoir qui l'a violée ?
Oui.
Pourquoi ?
Pour le punir.
Et si je vous disais
que celui qui l'a fait a déjà été puni ?
Le nom. Je veux le nom.
Carlo Ricardo.
Il était ici même.
Désolée pour votre frère.
- Vous le connaissiez ?
- Non.
Il n'a jamais pu se reposer.
Maintenant, il le pourra peut-être enfin.
BUREAU DU CORONER
<i>Dieu se repose sur vous, joyeux messieurs</i>
<i>Que rien ne vous abatte</i>
<i>Souvenez-vous que le Christ, notre Sauveur</i>
<i>Est né le jour de Noël</i>
<i>Pour nous sauver tous du pouvoir de Satan</i>
<i>Quand nous nous écartions du droit chemin</i>
<i>Nouvelle de réconfort et de joie</i>

<i>Nouvelle de réconfort et de joie</i>
Je devais mourir jeudi,
la dernière exécution du millénaire.
Le gouverneur ayant appris ma grossesse,
il a temporairement reporté l'exécution.
Connaissant Devlin, il essaie seulement
de résoudre les implications politiques
de la mise à mort
d'une femme
qui a conçu un enfant en prison.
- Vous savez qui est le père ?
- Évidemment.
- Mais vous ne le direz pas ?
- Non.
- La liste n'est pas bien longue.
- Peu importe le père.
Je veux que vous demandiez au gouverneur
de faire procéder à l'exécution.
- Vous voulez mourir ?
- Je dois mourir.
- Pourquoi ?
- J'ai tué mon premier enfant.
Ça y est, je l'ai dit.
Certaines choses ne deviennent réelles
qu'une fois prononcées.
Je sais.
Ma fille.
Mon trésor.
À sa naissance, c'était une joie.
Mais petit à petit, je me suis rendue compte
que quelque chose n'allait pas chez elle.
Elle n'était pas tout à fait humaine.
Comme d'un autre monde.
J'entrais dans sa chambre, il y avait
des flammes au-dessus du couffin.
Des flammes ?
Ou elle parlait en langues.
Un jour, elle a fait léviter une assiette.
J'ai commencé à comprendre
qu'elle était possédée par le démon.
- En avez-vous parlé à quelqu'un ?
- À qui ?
Ma mère ?
Le père de l'enfant, ce sale menteur ?
- Votre prêtre ? Un pédiatre ?
- Ils m'auraient prise pour une folle.
Non, le seul moyen
était de la tuer moi-même.
Mais chaque fois que je voulais frapper,
je ne voyais pas le démon.
Juste le mignon petit visage de ma fille.
Alors, je l'ai mise dans la voiture,
<i>je suis entrée dans le lac
et je l'ai laissée se noyer,</i>
attendant et espérant à moitié
la voir sortir de l'eau
sur le dos de Lucifer.
- Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
- Dieu vous bénisse.
Dans trois heures, je donne une soirée
pour près de 400 personnes.
- Qu'y a-t-il, avec Shirley Bellinger ?
- Elle veut être exécutée.
Bon. Cela résout tous mes problèmes.
- Un petit cadeau de plus sous le sapin.
- Excusez-moi, il y a un hic.
Elle est folle.
- Elle a noyé sa fille. On le savait.
- Sa place n'est pas ici
mais dans un hôpital psychiatrique.
Mais si elle veut mourir,
avons-nous le droit de l'en empêcher ?
Elle n'est pas en état
de prendre cette décision.
Elle est folle et elle est enceinte.
Et si vous l'exécutez, ce sera un meurtre.
Deux meurtres.
Transférez Bellinger.
Et monsieur le directeur,
laissez les détenus sortir des cellules.
La situation n'est pas encore maîtrisée.
C'est Noël. Le clergé me met la pression,
le cardinal y compris,
et il sera chez moi ce soir.
Laissez sortir les détenus !
<i>Dans l'esprit de cette période bénie,</i>
<i>la peine de Shirley Bellinger
est commuée en prison à vie</i>
<i>sans possibilité
de liberté conditionnelle.</i>
<i>Cela ne modifie en rien ma position
en faveur de la peine de mort.</i>
- Vous m'avez trahie.
- Je vous ai protégés, vous et votre bébé.
Je veux avorter et si vous me le refusez,
je tuerai ce monstre dans mon ventre.
Vous allez à l'hôpital Connelly.
Vous y serez sous surveillance permanente.
Vous faites une erreur !
Souvenez-vous-en. L'année prochaine
à cette époque, vous ne fêterez pas Noël.
Vous vous inclinerez devant Satan.
Le prochain millénaire lui appartient.
Satan est le père
et je suis la vierge mère !
Une seule chose
pourrait régler le problème.
Ta mort.
- Te revoilà.
- Oui. Toi aussi.
Tu vas mieux ?
Je suis vivant.
Grâce à toi.
Keller,
j'ai demandé à McManus
de nous remettre dans la même cellule.
Mince. Schillinger est de retour.
C'est pas un si mauvais type, Diane.
Qu'est-ce que tu as pris ?
- Il vaut sacrément mieux qu'eux.
- Eux, les "renois" ?
Oui.
- Tu viens déjeuner, Diane ?
- Oui.
Sale truc,
une accusation de harcèlement sexuel.
Je ne peux rien faire.
Ni le prouver, ni prouver le contraire.
- Ça reste en suspens.
- Ça crée sa propre réalité.
Un chou à la crème ?
Howell.
Diane, non !
Espèce de salope ! Viens ici, connasse !
C'est quoi, ton problème ? Allez, viens !
Salope !
Arrêtez !
Dites-moi si c'est trop serré.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Howell et Diane se sont battues, pour moi.
Bon Dieu !
Non, Léo. Épargne-moi ta morale à la con.
Rien à foutre. Il est temps
que tu prennes tes responsabilités
- pour les merdes que tu déclenches.
- Quoi ?
Je passe mes journées à ça, Léo,
à prendre des responsabilités.
Pour tout ce qui se passe ici. Tout
ce que je te demande, c'est ton soutien.
- Je t'ai soutenu.
- Oui, comme avec Wangler ?
- T'as pris son parti tout de suite.
- Non.
Si, bordel, t'as pris son parti !
Comme toujours.
Comme avec Hill, Said,
et même Clayton Hughes. Tous les frères.
Des deux côtés de la loi.
Selon toi, c'est parce qu'ils sont noirs ?
Compte les fois où c'est arrivé
et tires-en les conclusions.
- Je t'emmerde, McManus !
- Te gênes pas !
Tout le monde écoute.
C'est assez cicatrisé
pour retirer les pansements.
Je vous le rappelle à tous deux,
vous aurez des modifications
de pigmentation, mais c'est temporaire.
Votre peau retrouvera son apparence
normale d'ici six mois à un an. D'accord ?
Allez-y.
Bon sang !
Je trouverai peut-être
un taxi, maintenant.
- Alors, ça gaze ?
- Ça gaze, mec ?
- Bon sang, regardez-vous. Quel tableau.
- Oui, c'est pas croyable.
Pourquoi t'es plus à la cité ?
Pourquoi on n'y est plus,
c'est ce que je veux dire.
C'est que temporaire.
- Adebisi a un plan.
- Arrête tes conneries.
Adebisi va payer pour ce qu'il a fait...
Je suis d'accord. Il paiera, mais après.
Pour l'instant, écoutez où on en est.
<i>En Angleterre, le lendemain de Noël
s'appelle Boxing Day.</i>
Je ne sais pas bien pourquoi. Mais à Oz,
on boxe plus ou moins tous les jours.
J'ai entendu dire que Glynn envisageait
d'annuler le combat de championnat.
Pas de l'annuler, de le reporter.
- Combien de temps ?
- Indéfiniment.
- Ça craint !
- La vie est faite de déceptions, O'Reily.
Tu devrais l'avoir compris.
<i>Bismillah, je veux parler à ton chef.</i>
Tu as deux minutes.
Les gars attendent cette finale
depuis des mois.
Si vous la reportez,
il y aura des troubles.
Je sais.
La semaine dernière, il y a eu une bagarre
entre les musulmans et les Aryens,
- à laquelle vous avez participé.
- Schillinger a attaqué Said.
Je veux pas discuter des responsabilités.
Vous êtes tous responsables.
Schillinger a aussi attaqué Beecher,
qui est blanc.
Tu prétends
que la race n'avait rien à y voir ?
Rien ? Non.
Mais il y avait d'autres trucs en jeu.
Là, c'est juste un combat
entre deux boxeurs. Hein, Hamid ?
Que le meilleur gagne.
Très bien. Le combat aura lieu.
- Mais sans public.
- Quoi ?
Les boxeurs, leurs assistants,
l'arbitre et les juges.
- Pas question.
- À prendre ou à laisser.
Khan ! Vise un peu ça.
Même si tu m'as battu, on parie sur toi.
T'as raison. Rien ne l'arrêtera.
Nique sa jolie gueule blanche.
Dérouille son sale cul noir, Cyril.
Il nous laissera pas tomber.
C'est le roi. Montre-leur.
Il ferait bien de gagner, O'Reily,
ou t'es dans la merde.
Frappe ce putain de sac.
Plus fort, vas-y. Frappe ce putain de sac.
CHLORAL HYDRATÉ
Gardien Murphy.
Je me demandais
si vous savez où est Ryan O'Reily.
Au gymnase.
C'est drôle, qu'il aille toujours
au gymnase avant un combat.
Pourquoi ça ?
Pardonnez-moi.
Nous, les Russes,
sommes très soupçonneux.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Merde !
- Du chloral hydraté ?
Tu drogues l'eau de Khan
avec cette merde ?
Tu fais ça depuis le début ?
- Droguer les adversaires de Cyril ?
- Je ne voulais pas qu'il soit blessé.
Pour leur montrer
qu'il faut compter avec les Irlandais.
Si les autres l'apprennent,
il y aura une émeute.
Qui dit qu'ils doivent l'apprendre ?
Tu m'as peut-être pas vu,
- t'es peut-être même pas venu ici.
- Si.
Tu peux bien agiter le drapeau irlandais,
Ça ne change rien au fait.
Et maintenant ?
Le combat a lieu, à la loyale.
Sans drogue.
Cyril gagne ou perd de ses propres poings.
Ça restera secret.
Mais si j'apprends que t'as déconné
avec Khan, tu pars en isolement.
- Et comment Cyril battra Khan ?
- C'est pas mon problème.
Viens, allons-y.
- Ça va, frangin ?
- Je me sens bien, Ryan.
- Vraiment bien.
- Bon.
Les autres types que t'as battus
c'était le genre lavettes, hein ?
- Lavettes ?
- Oui.
Mais ce Khan... C'est un dur.
- Moi aussi.
- Oui, je sais.
Il te faudra être encore plus dur
pendant le combat, demain.
J'ai une surprise pour toi.
- Une surprise ?
- Oui.
Papa vient nous rendre visite.
Bon sang.
Distributeur de merde.
Cette putain de machine
a bouffé mes pièces.
Je suis là.
Y a quoi de si urgent ?
T'as dit à tante Brenda : "Une question
de vie et de mort."Je vois pas de sang.
Ça fait longtemps, papa.
Je suis à Oz depuis plus de trois ans.
- T'es jamais venu me voir.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a à voir ?
J'y ai été, je sais comment c'est.
Quand même, quand Cyril a atterri ici,
t'aurais pu venir.
Quel bien ça peut vous faire
à l'un ou à l'autre ?
- Je boxe.
- Quoi ? Cause français.
- Pourquoi tu ris ?
- Il boxe contre qui, un autre débile ?
- Non, il est en finale du championnat.
- Bon Dieu.
Je croyais qu'Oz avait des couilles.
Mais si un crétin comme toi
peut être champion !
Pourquoi tu craches toujours
sur tout ce qu'on fait ?
- Parce que vous faites que de la merde.
- On a été à bonne école.
Commence pas avec ça.
Vous aviez une bonne vie.
Un bon foyer, et vous avez tout bousillé !
Deux petits voyous de rien du tout,
toujours à boire et à courir,
comme votre salope de mère.
- Ta gueule.
- Je t'emmerde.
Ta gueule !
Merci, papa. Tu m'as aidé, comme toujours.
Grouille-toi. Vas-y.
C'est ça, direct.
- Ta garde, Cyril.
- Finis-le !
Direct, Hamid.
Un, deux, trois,
- quatre, cinq, six, sept.
- C'est bon, allez.
- Respire.
- Vas-y, Cyril.
Allez, respire. On y va.
On y va, continue.
Ta garde.
Travaille-le au corps.
... trois, quatre...
- Respire.
... cinq, six, sept, huit.
- Doucement. Prends ton temps. Il va bien.
Laisse-le se battre.
- Défense.
- Vas-y.
Reste sur lui ! Continue ! C'est ça.
- Assieds-toi.
- Je veux arrêter.
Y a pas moyen d'arrêter, bordel.
C'est rien. Travaille-le au corps.
La tête, vas-y...
- Je veux arrêter.
- Non, pas question.
Ne pense pas que c'est Khan.
Regarde-moi. Pense que c'est papa.
Ce mec a rien du tout.
- Papa ?
- Oui, papa. D'accord ?
Sois sérieux, d'accord ? T'as compris ?
Pense à papa, devant toi.
- Maintenant, vas-y.
- La cloche.
T'as compris. Vas-y.
Deuxième round.
Allez. Sur lui.
Fais attention.
Papa !
- Fais gaffe à lui, Hamid.
- Vas-y, Cyril, papa !
Vas-y, Cyril.
Merde !
C'est ça, reste sur lui.
Regarde ce que t'as fait.
- Corps à corps !
- Vas-y !
Vas-y, maintenant.
T'as réussi ! T'as gagné, bordel !
Dans mes bras.
Je suis le champion !
Sa jambe a un problème !
Il ne bouge pas ! Appelez quelqu'un !
Appelez quelqu'un !
Khan, tu m'entends ?
Allez, Hamid. Quelqu'un !
Tu m'entends ? Allez.
- Tu m'entends ?
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Recule.
Un médecin !
- J'ai fait du mal à ce type.
- Non, il s'en remettra.
Non.
Je lui ai fait beaucoup de mal.
Pourquoi ? Pourquoi
tu m'as fait faire ça ?
Va te coucher, s'il te plaît. Allez.
Dis-moi. Pourquoi il a fallu
que je le blesse ?
Tu vas la fermer et aller te coucher ?
Je suis fatigué.
Non, réponds-moi maintenant.
Pourquoi tu m'as fait penser à papa ?
Et à maman ? Pourquoi ?
Pour survivre.
Tu comprends pas encore ?
Pour survivre
dans ce putain de trou à rats.
Tu veux la vérité ?
Khan a des lésions cérébrales.
- Non.
- Si.
Je l'ai vu quand il est tombé.
Ses yeux étaient vides et tout.
Alors, je l'ai rendu comme moi ?
Non.
Pire.
Non !
Mon mari a une chance de s'en sortir ?
Un spécialiste est venu vérifier
le diagnostic du Dr Nathan.
Il a confirmé : Hamid est en coma dépassé.
Il est sous respirateur artificiel.
Mon mari n'aurait pas voulu de ça.
- Je vous en prie, débranchez le respirateur.
- Malheureusement, c'est impossible.
La loi exige
que nous le maintenions sous traitement.
Mais je suis sa femme.
Dans ce cas, madame,
comme il est prisonnier,
vos désirs, les siens,
ne peuvent être pris en considération.
C'est vous qui avez molesté
un jeune détenu noir, non ?
J'ai été accusé. Ce n'est pas vrai.
Je trouve déplacé
de parler de la vie de mon mari
en sa présence.
- Mme Khan...
- C'est bon.
Je vais partir. Je suis navré
de ce qui s'est passé.
Vous n'avez pas fini de l'être.
Je vais attaquer cette prison en justice.
D'abord, pour débrancher le respirateur
et ensuite, pour négligence.
Pour avoir autorisé ce match de boxe.
Votre mari était conscient du risque.
Il a accepté de son plein gré.
Il a insisté pour que le match ait lieu.
C'est vous qui le dites.
Nous laisserons un jury en décider.
Tout le monde s'inquiète
du bogue de l'an 2000.
En 2000, les ordinateurs
auront une dépression nerveuse.
Les avions tomberont du ciel,
les réserves d'eau s'assécheront
et le Pentagone enverra
des ogives nucléaires sur le Canada.
Certains prédisent que les portes
des prisons s'ouvriront automatiquement.
Mais j'ai la solution :
on refait tout.
À minuit, il est de nouveau 1900
et on recommence tout le putain de siècle.
Voyons les choses en face.
La première fois, on a pas vraiment gazé.
31 décembre.
Tu la sens ?
Quoi ?
La haine.
Il y a de la haine dans l'air.
- C'est un jour comme les autres à Oz.
- Non, mon ami, c'est bien pire.
Regarde.
Adebisi est avec Arif.
Et tous ces visages blancs
agglutinés.
J'ai très peur de ce qui risque d'arriver.
Fais quelque chose, alors.
Je ne peux pas.
Il y a trois ans, j'ai déclenché l'émeute
et provoqué toutes ces morts.
Je reconnais ma culpabilité. Enfin.
Mais ça...
je ne veux pas m'en mêler.
T'as bousillé Khan. On va te bousiller.
Recule, connard. C'était un accident.
- Recule, putain, et laisse-moi passer.
- Tu te crois grand, le nain ? Amène-toi.
Arrête, ducon.
Mon père aussi a été tué dans cette pièce.
Circule.
J'avais trouvé mon guide,
il m'avait trouvé.
Il m'a appris ma vie,
mon âme, mon patrimoine.
Et comme votre père,
on l'a tué comme un animal.
- Jara est mort là.
- Tire-toi, Adebisi.
Oui, mettez-vous en colère.
Il ne s'agit pas de coïncidences.
Les eaux sont profondes.
- Je sais qui a tué votre père.
- Quoi ?
En envoyant Mukada chercher des réponses,
vous avez eu les réponses que vous vouliez.
- Glynn m'a fourni les réponses.
- Je me suis renseigné. Je connais la vérité.
- Et donc ?
- Qui a laissé ses empreintes sur le surin ?
Réveillez-vous, mon frère,
ils vous veulent aussi.
Je surveillerai vos arrières,
surveillez les miens.
Bouge ton cul, Adebisi !
J'aurais aimé voir cet enfoiré de Khan
se faire mettre K. -O.
Oui, Allah était peut-être de sortie.
Les meilleurs boxeurs
sont pas tous des nègres.
Je vous emmerde tous les deux.
Je m'inquiète de l'agitation,
depuis que Khan a été écrasé.
Je sais. Je t'entends
raconter des conneries.
C'est pas des conneries.
C'est vrai, les négros,
vous vous êtes toujours fait niquer.
Moi aussi.
Mais tout le bruit que tu fais
va foutre la merde, ici.
On peut pas dealer
quand on est en cellule 24 heures sur 24.
Il y a des trucs
qui comptent plus que le deal.
Plus que le fric.
Plus que le fric ?
Il recommence à débloquer.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Les renois mijotent quelque chose.
Ils mijotent toujours quelque chose.
Et toi aussi.
Un tas de conneries nous ont opposés,
mais faut les mettre de côté.
Au moins pour l'instant.
Il faut s'accrocher à la seule chose
qu'on a en commun :
la couleur de notre peau.
Je vais pas écouter ces conneries.
- Viens, Chris.
- Attends. Je veux entendre ce qu'il a à dire.
Je suis russe et juif.
Mais je suis aussi blanc.
Schillinger, tu m'acceptes
dans ton groupe ?
- Oui.
- Et merde.
Attends, mec. Tiens.
Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
D'abord t'es pote avec Adebisi
et maintenant t'es gentil avec moi ?
Tu veux ma peau
depuis que Coyle a été tué.
Coyle, c'est du passé.
Je vis dans le présent.
Et le présent me dit
que si on se regroupe pas,
on mourra chacun dans son coin.
Tout va bien.
Ça va mal.
Et maintenant ?
On fait quoi ?
On attend.
On agit les premiers.
L'occasion se présentera.
À la première occasion, on leur montre
qu'on est toujours les patrons.
T'es sûr ?
Je ne sais pas.
Oui.
Fais-moi confiance.
Tu peux dire aux branleurs du courrier
de pas feuilleter mes magazines ?
C'est le boulot.
Inspecter tout ce qui arrive à Oz.
<i>Inspecter, pas se palucher dessus.
Je paie un max pour Penthouse.</i>
- Je veux pas de pages toutes collées.
- Circule.
En rang !
Quoi encore ?
J'essaie d'être sympa pendant les fêtes.
Résultat ?
Ça devient un vrai merdier.
Des ordures partout, des lits pas faits,
des étrons dans les toilettes.
Ça suffit, bordel !
Vous connaissez le règlement.
La cité d'émeraude
est censée être impeccable.
La propreté est voisine de la sainteté.
Tant que cet endroit
n'est pas conforme à mes normes,
je vais devoir nettoyer votre esprit
du désordre.
Je confisque toutes les revues pornos.
Vous avez le choix, messieurs.
Vous amendez votre conduite
ou vous pouvez dire adieu aux gonzesses.
Pas celle-là, mec.
Voilà ce que je veux dire.
- Ce qu'ils nous font.
- Tu cherches quoi, mec ?
Une autre émeute ? Le seul résultat,
c'est que d'autres frères seront tués.
- On est en majorité.
- Oui, mais on n'a pas de flingues.
Certains gardes restent nos frères,
ils voudront peut-être nous aider.
Je vais te dire : t'es dingue.
Soit t'es avec nous,
soit t'es avec eux.
Ça a marché ?
Oui, je crois.
T'as quoi, là, Hill ?
Tu veux faire un tour au mitard ?
Je veux voir des gonzesses.
Le gouverneur a déjà interdit
les visites conjugales, et maintenant ça !
- Je vous emmerde !
- Bon, ça suffit, au mitard.
Ça continue !
D'abord Wangler, puis Khan
et maintenant Hill.
Il en faudra encore combien
pour vous réveiller ?
On ne doit pas laisser passer
ces brutalités.
C'est le Coran qui le dit.
"Permission est donnée à ceux qui se battent
car il leur a été fait du tort.
"Et Allah peut leur donner la victoire."
Finis la citation, Arif.
Le Coran est un livre d'amour,
pas de haine.
Il s'adresse à ce qu'il y a
de bon en nous.
Allah ignore la couleur de la peau.
Tu utilises les mots à tes propres fins.
Mes fins ?
J'ai inventé le racisme, peut-être ?
J'ai vécu dans les mêmes rues que toi.
Je connais les préjugés.
Je sais ce que c'est
que d'être le seul Noir dans une pièce.
Oui, il faut corriger les torts
qui nous ont été infligés,
- mais pas comme ça, mon frère.
- Comment, alors ?
En essayant de les comprendre.
Aucun Blanc ne peut comprendre
ce que c'est que d'être noir.
Ni l'inverse.
Le Coran dit...
Je me fous de ce que dit ton Coran.
Il y a des choses dont tu te fous pas ?
La justice. Exactement comme toi.
Libérez Hill !
- Libérez Hill !
- Vos gueules !
L'équipe d'intervention
spéciale est prête.
J'ai décidé que tous les détenus
resteraient en cellule pour l'instant.
Je vous demande d'être prudents
et prêts à toute éventualité.
C'est tout.
- Je ne peux pas revivre ça.
- Ça va aller.
Non, je vais poser mes vacances.
S'ils n'acceptent pas, je démissionne.
- Diane...
- Non, sérieusement. Je démissionne.
- T'as peur, Murph ?
- Oui, évidemment.
Moi aussi.
- Léo.
- Oui.
- Fini de se cacher derrière nos insignes.
- Comment ça ?
Toutes ces années,
tu as marché dans le système,
travaillé pour eux, enfermé les tiens,
tu n'as jamais l'impression
d'avoir trahi ton peuple ?
- Non.
- Non ?
Les gens qui sont enfermés ici
ne sont pas mon peuple.
Mon peuple, c'est ceux
qui respectent la loi.
Rentre chez toi, Clayton. Tu es viré.
Beaucoup pensent que le monde va finir
à l'aube du nouveau millénaire.
Ils croient que le Christ reviendra,
que ce sera l'apocalypse, la fin du monde.
Ils invoquent le grand plan de Dieu.
Mais posez-vous la question :
"Dieu sait-Il que c'est le 1er janvier ?"
A-t-Il réglé sa montre à minuit ?
Et si oui, dans quel fuseau horaire ?
L'homme a inventé les heures,
les jours et les minutes.
Il a inventé les calendriers
et les horloges.
Dieu a Son propre horaire et il est stupide
de croire qu'Il peut dépendre de nous.
On ne peut que regarder tourner l'horloge
et espérer.
Bonne Année.
Oui.
Bonne Année.
Bonne Année.
- Bonne Année, enfoiré !
- Je t'emmerde, petit con.
Bonne Année, petit frère.
Une bande de types en cellules
à l'aube d'une nouvelle année,
d'un nouveau siècle,
d'un nouveau millénaire...
1000 ans.
Regard tourné l'avenir
et tout ce qu'ils y voient,
c'est eux-mêmes dans les mêmes cellules.
Noirs ou Blancs,
on est au bord du précipice.
On s'accroche ou on tombe.
Ensemble ou séparément.
À nous de choisir. Nous.
Vous et moi.
<i>Bonne Année !</i>
Oz... le nom qu’on donne
à la maison de correction
de Oswald,
niveau quatre.
Vous avez pu
entendre aux infos
qu’on a eu un peu de...
tension dans le coin.
Eh bien, après 14 jours de pur
bonheur assis dans nos cellules
à renifler les pets du voisin,
un homme est prêt
à tout pardonner
à tous,
pour respirer un coup.
Les personnes suivantes
sortiront de leurs cellules :
93A234, Adebisi.
97A622, Arif.
97S444, Said.
99P334, Pinkerton.
95B327, Busmalis.
85T612, Tyrell.
95W856, Wolf.
et 88A578, Ahmad.
Alignez-vous derrière
l’Agent Howard.
Allez, c’est bon, on avance.
Allez. On avance.
Ils foutent quoi ?
Comment ça ?
Ils embarquent
tous les nègres.
OK, silence.
J’ai dit : silence !
La ferme, maintenant !
Ces deux dernières semaines,
on a tout bouclé 24/24h.
Je ne vais pas
entrer dans les détails
de ce qui a causé
cette situation.
Vous le savez.
Je vous ai rassemblés
pour vous dire ceci :
Le bouclage se terminera
en fonction de vous.
Mon intention est
de rendre à cette prison
sa routine.
Mais, écoutez-moi bien.
S’il y a un seul incident
de violence raciale,
je vous bouclerai à nouveau,
noir et blanc,
24/24h, 7 /7j,
pour le restant
de vos putain de vies.
Tu vois ?
Tout ce que tu racontes,
ça sert à rien.
Patience, Kenny, j’ai un plan.
Glynn est malade ou quoi ?
C’est pas fini.
Les nègres sont sur un coup.
Avec le retour de l’ordre,
le directeur Leo Glynn
a mis fin au bouclage.
De même, la femme
du prisonnier Hamid Khan
a obtenu de la cour suprême
que son mari soit débranché.
Khan, qui purgeait une peine de 10 ans
pour coups et blessures,
était dans le coma
depuis un coup sur la tête
reçu pendant un match
de boxe à la prison.
McManus veut te voir.
La famille est avec Khan,
pour faire leurs adieux.
Ils ont demandé que
tu pries devant le corps,
- avant la fin.
- Sachant
ce qui est arrivé
entre Khan et moi...
c’est un honneur.
Sans le Frère Khan,
il nous faut quelqu’un
d’autre pour nous diriger.
Et je sais à qui tu penses.
Toi-même.
Oui.
Mais il faut que je sache, Said.
Tu t’y opposeras ?
Non, Arif.
J’ai perdu le goût.
- Le goût ?
- Du pouvoir.
J’espère que tu l’utiliseras
avec plus de sagesse que moi.
On y va.
L’homme que j’ai frappé,
il va mieux ?
Il ira vachement mieux
dans 10 minutes.
Va te coucher, Cyril.
Maintenant.
Allah, pardonne-lui
et aie pitié.
Donne-lui la paix
et le pardon.
- Qu’est-ce que tu veux ?
- Tu m’as tué, Cyril.
- J’ai pas fait exprès.
- Et pour lui ?
C’est qui ?
Preston Nathan.
Le mari de Gloria.
On te quittera jamais, Cyril.
On restera dans ta tête
pour toujours.
Pour le restant de l’éternité.
Cyril, Cyril...
Réveille-toi !
Tout va bien. Chut.
Mon frère, Cyril,
il continue d’avoir
ces terribles cauchemars.
Le Valium ne l’aide
pas à dormir ?
Non. Il faut essayer
autre chose.
Les cauchemars sont
causés par sa culpabilité
- d’avoir fait tous ces morts.
- Oui.
Et le remède pour ton frère
est d’apaiser sa culpabilité.
Et, dans le cas d’Hamid Khan,
je ne suis pas sûre
que ce soit possible.
Cependant, pour
le mari de Gloria Nathan...
Je ferais n’importe quoi.
N’importe quoi.
Tu as entendu parler de
mon programme d’interaction ?
Les victimes et/ou
les familles des victimes
parlent avec la personne
qui les a blessées.
- De quoi ?
- Leurs sentiments, leur colère.
Le coupable a une chance
d’exprimer des regrets.
Ouais, OK.
- Ouais, inscrivez Cyril.
- Une minute.
- C’est pour vous deux.
- Quoi ?
Je ne vais pas
demander à Gloria
et aux parents de Preston
de se joindre à nous
si vous ne participez pas
tous les deux.
Pas de problème.
Non, absolument pas.
Je ne peux pas être dans
la même pièce que les O’Reily.
J’en ai la chair de poule.
C’est l’occasion de laisser
le passé derrière soi.
J’en ai rien à foutre que
Cyril O’Reily dorme mieux.
Avec une bonne dose de Valium,
il dormirait pour de bon.
Gloria, tu sais que
ce n’est pas pour Cyril.
Ça donnerait une chance
aux parents de Preston d’en finir.
Tu pourrais aussi en finir.
En finir ?
Les gens pensent
que je suis infirmière.
Même s’ils entendent
qu’on m’appelle Dr. Nathan,
on m’appelle « l’infirmière ».
Peut-être parce que
je suis une femme, ou une Latina.
Ou bien trop gentille
pour être docteur.
Tu veux dire que tu vas le faire ?
Je veux dire que je me fous
de ce qu’on me raconte.
Merde !
Eh, Soeur Pete.
Gloria a dit quoi ?
Elle a dit non, Ryan.
Désolée.
Avec le temps,
elle changera peut-être d’avis.
Oui, mais, et pour Cyril ?
Enfin, quoi.
On augmente sa dose.
Quoi ?
Ryan !
- Qu’est-ce qui se passe ?
- O’Reily s’est coupé.
Voilà.
- C’est comment ?
- Serré.
- Repose-toi un peu.
- Ouais.
J’ai demandé à Said
de me parler de la nuit dernière,
de la mort de Hamid Khan.
Il a dit qu’ils avaient enroulé Khan
dans un drap blanc propre,
qu’ils avaient mis
du parfum et prié.
O’Reily, tu te fous
de Hamid Khan.
Non, non, je sais pas.
Je voulais être sûr
qu’on avait tout bien fait.
Mon frère a gagné
dans les règles de l’art.
Félicitations, l’Amérique.
Cette année, la population
carcérale a atteint son pic,
deux millions.
Deux millions de gens sont,
comment vous dîtes ?
Incarcérés.
Deux putain de millions.
C’est la population de Vienne.
C’est la population
de Houston, Texas.
Les USA dénombrent 5%
de la population mondiale,
mais aussi 25%
des prisonniers du monde.
Youpi !
Bevilaqua.
Alvarez.
Giles.
McCullum.
Et merde !
Chef, ici C-11.
On a un 74, cellule 23.
- Il s’est passé quoi ?
- Il est mort ?
Ouais, merde, regarde
ses bras et ses jambes.
- Ils sont tout rognés.
- Il s’est mangé lui-même.
C’est dégueulasse.
Je vais remplir des papiers
pendant un mois.
Connard !
La mort de McCullum
est un suicide.
Il a mordu sa peau et
mâché ses muscles
pendant une semaine,
causant une hémorragie.
- Mon Dieu !
- Comme un cannibale.
Les cannibales
mangent les autres.
Comment on appelle un gars
qui se mange lui-même ?
- Un original.
- La méthode est moins
importante que l’acte.
C’est le troisième suicide
en isolement en deux ans.
Sans parler de la tentative
d’Alvarez qui a presque réussi.
- Ça veut dire quoi ?
- Il faut changer les conditions.
Les conditions ?
Ils sont en isolement, merde !
Vous voulez quoi,
qu’on leur serve du thé ?
Pas besoin de parler comme ça,
ni de cette attitude.
Désolée, j’aimerais
que la vie en isolement
soit aussi agréable
qu’à Emerald City.
Mais on récupère ceux que les autres
unités n’arrivent pas à gérer.
Je suis d’accord avec Claire.
Le seul moyen de gérer
ces criminels est de les dominer.
Je ne conteste pas,
M. le directeur,
mais il faut
un compromis.
- J’écoute.
- Dans certaines prisons,
les gars en isolement ont
une heure de sortie chaque jour.
- Très contrôlée.
- Exact.
Si on les laisse se promener,
- ils se comporteront mieux.
- Ça vaut le coup d’essayer.
Puisque mon cul est
dans la ligne de mire,
quelqu’un est volontaire
pour m’escorter ?
OK, Claire, ça suffit.
Gloria l’a dit, ça vaut
le coup d’essayer.
Bevilaqua !
Prisonnier numéro 99B521,
Louis Bevilaqua.
Condamné le 2 avril 1999.
Homicide volontaire,
possession illégale
d’arme à feu.
Sentence : 25 ans.
Conditionnelle dans 12 ans.
Eh, Alvarez, tu fous
quoi en isolement ?
Cette fois, j’ai tué
Carlo Ricardo.
Carlo est mort, tu l’as tué ?
Ouais, il fallait.
Le Cid m’a envoyé ici
pour me baiser.
Carlo était mon cousin.
Vous êtes censés
faire marcher vos jambes,
pas vos langues.
La ferme.
Bevilaqua dit qu’il sait
qu’Alvarez a tué Carlo.
Bevilaqua veut savoir
si tu veux qu’il achève Alvarez.
Oui. Dis-lui
que je veux qu’il crève.
Alvarez.
Bevilaqua.
Salut, Aqua.
J’ai une histoire marrante
à te raconter.
Glynn a commencé
à m’emmerder
pour savoir qui avait
violé sa fille,
alors, il m’a foutu
en isolement.
- J’ai dit que c’était Carlo.
- Carlo n’y était pas.
Ouais, je sais.
Tu crois qu’il se passera quoi
quand Glynn saura
que t’as violé sa gosse ?
Chef, ici C-11.
On a besoin de renfort
au gymnase !
- Je répète, renforts au gymnase !
- Bevilaqua est mort.
- Et Alvarez ?
- Soins intensifs.
- Il vivra ?
- Malheureusement oui.
J’espère que ça mettra
fin aux sorties.
Oui, mais je vous transfère
dans une autre unité.
- Parce que j’avais raison ?
- Ouvrez cette porte.
Peter... Peter Marie ?
Oui, c’est exact.
William, pourquoi ?
Moi, petit rasoir,
paquet de cookies,
Maman colère,
George Washington,
cerisier, couper.
Tu as dit la vérité à ta mère
sur le vol des cookies ?
Au chocolat, miam-miam.
Mais, qu’est-ce
que ça a à voir
- avec Bevilaqua et Alvarez ?
- Menteurs, menteurs.
Je tue, mais ne mens pas.
Jamais, ne mens jamais.
Putain d’Alvarez,
il a plus de vies
- qu’un chat !
- Il vit toujours ?
Tout juste, à l’hôpital.
Assure-toi que ce connard
n’en sorte pas, OK ?
C’est pour moi.
Merde !
De quoi ?
- Tes fils ?
- Ouais.
Ça vient d’une
de mes cousines.
Elle a appris pour Andrew.
C’est dur de perdre un gosse.
Mon autre fils, Hank,
me manque encore plus.
T’as pas de nouvelles ?
Pas depuis que je suis à Oz.
Quand ils sont aussi jeunes,
on ne voit que les possibilités.
Allons-y.
Il faut que je renouvelle
mon abonnement.
Eh, Beecher, c’est pour toi.
C’est vide.
Ouais, on a dû
confisquer le contenu.
Une lettre de ma grand-mère ?
Qu’est-ce qu’il pouvait
y avoir à confisquer ?
Si je te le disais, tu le saurais.
- Salut, Tobias.
- Père M.
Pete est dans le coin ?
Non, elle voit
son psychiatre en ville.
Elle voit un psy ?
Oui, depuis qu’elle pense quitter
les ordres. Vous saviez pas ?
Non.
C’est pas vraiment mes oignons.
Comment ça va, Tobias ?
Oh, vous savez...
Ouais.
Des problèmes
avec Vern Schillinger ?
Il y aura toujours
des problèmes,
jusqu’à ce que l’un de nous
finisse à la morgue.
Oh, je ne crois pas ça.
Je sais que
vous vous êtes causés
énormément de problèmes
au fil des ans,
mais il doit y avoir
un moyen de faire la paix.
Il faut pardonner
à Schillinger.
J’ai essayé et j’ai fini avec
une hémorragie interne.
Sans Chris Keller,
je serais mort.
Tu lui as dit
que tu lui pardonnais ?
Comment ça ?
Je lui ai dit en face.
Cette fois, ne lui dis pas.
Peut-être qu’il le sait.
Alors, des idées ?
Faut que tu fasses un truc
extraordinaire pour Schillinger
mais sans lui dire
que tu l’as fait.
Comment il saura ?
Ces choses se révèlent
d’elles-mêmes.
Mais quand Schillinger saura,
il verra ton geste
pour ce qu’il était.
Un acte de gentillesse,
de réconciliation.
- C’est des conneries.
- Chris.
Non, ne fais rien.
Compris ?
Quoi, tu me donnes des ordres ?
Et oui.
- Salut, Papa.
- Toby...
Oh, mon fils, t’as l’air bien.
Mieux qu’à ta dernière visite.
- J’ai mis de l’argent sur ton compte.
- Merci.
Je peux faire autre chose ?
En fait, Papa, oui.
Un autre prisonnier,
Vern Schillinger,
avait deux fils.
Le plus vieux, Andrew, a été...
est mort récemment.
L’autre, Hank...
Vern a perdu sa trace.
Ils communiquent plus.
J’espérais qu’un
des détectives du cabinet
pourrait faire
des recherches.
Tu veux trouver le gosse ?
Voici les infos
que j’ai pu rassembler.
Swannee s’en occupera.
Il est notre meilleur
détective privé.
Merci, Papa.
Toby, je suis très fier de toi.
- Fier ?
- Tu es là à vivre l’enfer,
et tu essaies d’aider
un prisonnier
à retrouver son dernier
fils vivant.
Tu es un être humain
remarquable.
Ouais.
Je suis remarquable, c’est ça.
Salut.
Comment va Papa ?
Bien, super.
Tu sens bon.
C’est l’après-rasage
de mon père.
- Eh, non.
- Quoi ?
Il faut que je te parle.
Qu’est-ce qui est
si important ?
Je sais comment tu vas réagir.
Bon, quoi ?
J’ai demandé à mon père
de localiser le fils de Schillinger.
On en a parlé.
On était d’accord.
- On était pas d’accord.
- Alors, soudain tu veux aider
ce connard de Schillinger ?
Non, je veux nous aider,
toi et moi.
Je veux arrêter de vivre
chaque jour dans la peur.
C’est la définition même
d’être vivant, l’ami.
Pas forcément.
Chris, parfois, souvent,
j’aimerais pouvoir
effacer le passé.
Effacer tout ce que j’ai fait.
Tout ce que j’ai dit pour
blesser les gens que j’aime.
J’aimerais pouvoir regarder les gens
sans voir la peine qu’ils m’ont causée.
Et c’est peut-être le moyen
de faire de ce désir une réalité.
Tu t’entends causer ?
Tu te prends pour la Fée Clochette ?
Tu vois des étoiles filantes ?
Je suis en partie responsable
de la mort d’Andrew.
Il faut que je répare ça,
et toi aussi.
Tu sais quoi ?
Oz n’a pas fait de toi une pute.
T’es né comme ça.
Ouais, OK.
Merde.
- Allez !
- Viens, petite pute.
- Qui a commencé ?
- J’ai commencé !
- Au trou !
- Je suis la pute de personne !
T’es pas ma pute, salope !
La fête est finie. Ça suffit !
Je suis la pute de personne.
La plupart dirait :
« Deux millions de prisonniers ?
Pas de problème puisque
la criminalité baisse ».
Mais la Californie, qui a augmenté
sa population carcérale
bien plus que,
disons, New York,
a connu une plus petite
baisse de criminalité.
Cause et effet ?
Je ne crois pas.
Shirley Bellinger qui attendait
son exécution depuis un an
pour le meurtre
de sa jeune fille,
va retourner à la prison
d’Oswald aujourd’hui.
La condamnation à mort
de Bellinger fut commuée
quand elle tomba enceinte
pendant son emprisonnement.
Après une fausse couche dans
des circonstances suspectes,
le gouverneur Devlin
a révoqué sa décision.
Voilà, Shirley.
Je ne peux pas
récupérer ma cellule ?
Comme tu le vois,
elle est prise.
Il échangerait
peut-être avec moi.
Tu échangerais avec moi ?
Désolé, je suis bien installé.
Je te le rendrai bien.
- Y’a rien que tu puisses me rendre.
- Tu serais surpris.
Entre là.
Comment ça va ?
Je m’appelle Shirley, et toi ?
Suce ma bite, salope.
C’est pas très poli.
Et toi ?
Un mot doux
pour une étrangère ?
Ouais.
Moïse Deyell.
Moïse ? Tu peux
peut-être nous mener
hors d’Égypte
vers la Terre Promise.
J’y compterais pas trop.
Comment t’as fini ici ?
Prisonnier numéro 00D718,
Moïse Deyell.
Condamné le 3 février 2000,
pour double assassinat.
Sentence : la mort.
Elle te trompait ?
Ouais...
... avec son mari.
Ils étaient mariés ?
La salope m’avait dit
que c’était fini.
Je ne baise pas la femme
d’un autre homme.
- J’ai des principes.
- J’aime les hommes de principes.
Quand j’ai été élu gouverneur,
la criminalité était
hors de contrôle,
mais on a travaillé, on s’est battus
pour la loi des trois crimes...
Cet enfoiré veut se faire réélire
après ce qu’il a fait ?
- Je vote pour lui.
- Quoi, pourquoi ?
Les choses sont meilleures
qu’elles ne l’étaient il y a quatre ans.
- Mieux pour quoi ? Pas pour nous.
- Ben, en général,
la vie s’est améliorée dans l’État
depuis l’élection de Devlin.
L’économie est meilleure,
la criminalité en baisse.
- Tu voterais pour ce connard ?
- Oui.
Tu peux pas voter.
T’as commis un crime.
- Tu n’as plus le droit de vote.
- Vraiment ?
Vraiment.
Ben, c’est bon.
J’ai jamais voté
de toute façon.
Le courage de diriger.
James Devlin, gouverneur.
- Bienvenue.
- Merci de me recevoir.
Le manager de campagne
du gouverneur me dit
qu’elle veut causer,
je suis intrigué.
Asseyez-vous.
Vous verrez que je ne tourne
jamais autour du pot.
Frank Feeley ne sera pas candidat
comme gouverneur adjoint.
Nous ne l’avons pas encore
annoncé à la presse,
mais il a un cancer
à la gorge.
- C’est triste.
- Je sais.
Il attirait beaucoup
de votes au nord.
Le gouverneur m’a demandé
de faire une courte liste de gens
pour remplacer Frank
pour la candidature.
J’aimerais ajouter
votre nom à la liste.
Moi ? En campagne
avec Devlin ?
Je sais que vous avez eu
vos différends,
mais vous êtes aussi conservateur
que lui sur bien des sujets.
Ça n’aurait rien à voir
avec Alvah Case qui entre
en campagne contre Devlin ?
Pour être honnête, bien sûr.
La réputation
de cette administration
auprès de la communauté afro-américaine
est un peu ternie.
Mais, je pense que
vous feriez un bon adjoint.
C’est une offre ?
Non. Vous êtes déjà sur la liste.
La convention est
dans deux mois.
D’ici là, améliorez
votre profile publique.
- Comment ?
- C’est pour ça que je suis là.
Pour vous expliquer tout ça.
Contente que vous soyez
intéressé, Leo.
- Je n’ai pas dit que je l’étais.
- Oh, mais si.
- Salut, Andrea.
- McManus.
Qu’est-ce qui t’amène ici ?
- Tu as vu Diane ?
- Non.
Elle devait pas rentrer
de vacances aujourd’hui ?
Elle n’est pas venue.
On m’a demandé de rester,
ce qui m’emmerde parce
que je crois que j’ai la grippe.
Oh, reste dans ton coin.
- Je peux pas être malade.
- Et moi je peux ?
J’ai trois gosses
et mon mari gerbe
depuis deux jours.
Oh, merde, écoute,
si t’as des nouvelles de Diane,
tu peux lui dire de m’appeler ?
- Bien sûr.
- Soigne-toi bien.
J’ai pas mal réfléchi.
Je sais que je me suis
dispersé et tout,
mais, on pourrait
réessayer, ensemble.
Tu es occupé ?
Oh, non, non, non, entre.
Quel est le problème ?
Pas de problème.
Je viens de parler à Diane.
Elle est où ?
Elle est toujours à Londres.
J’ai appelé son hôtel.
Elle est partie.
- Oui...
- Ses deux semaines sont finies.
Elle devait revenir
travailler aujourd’hui.
Que fait-elle
encore à Londres ?
Eh bien, Dee-Dee et elle
étaient devant le Palais
de Buckingham
et elle a eu
une conversation avec...
un garde.
- Je croyais qu’ils parlaient pas.
- Il faisait une pause.
Bref, une chose
mena à une autre,
et...
ils vont se marier.
C’est ça.
Je suis sérieuse.
- Elle va se marier ?
- Oui.
Avec un flic ?
Non, non, pas un flic,
Tim, c’est un garde.
Il garde la reine.
Putain, je vois tout de suite
ce qu’ils ont en commun !
Oh, merde !
Putain de merde !
- Elle a laissé un numéro ?
- Elle ne veut pas te parler.
J’ai un tas de trucs à lui dire !
C’est pour ça
qu’elle ne veut pas te parler.
- Elle se sent mal pour toi.
- Oh, vraiment ?
Écoute, Tim.
Diane Wittlesey n’a
pas eu une vie facile.
Pauvreté, abus conjugal,
mère célibataire,
sa mère qui meurt
après une longue maladie.
Et maintenant,
au téléphone, sa voix...
Elle semblait si heureuse.
Heureuse ?
Bien sûr.
Si tu as besoin de parler...
J’ai surtout besoin de boire.
- Tim...
- Ne t’inquiète pas.
C’est ce que les hommes
plaqués font
pour pouvoir refaire leur vie.
Chin-chin.
Adebisi, t’as toujours le flingue ?
Baisse d’un ton.
- Tu l’as toujours ?
- Oui.
Tu vas l’utiliser quand ?
- Jamais.
- Pourquoi t’as un flingue
si tu l’utilises pas ?
Si j’utilise le flingue,
je finis au trou, en isolement
ou dans le couloir de la mort.
On voulait se débarrasser
de McManus, tu te souviens ?
Pour qu’un noir
dirige Emerald City.
Comme si tu pouvais y arriver ?
Je peux, en fonction de qui
se servira du flingue,
- et qui se fera butter.
- Je comprends pas.
Bien sûr que non, Kenny.
Bien sûr que non.
OK, c’est l’heure
de retourner dans vos cages.
En ligne !
Andrew a dit que tu nous renverrais
à Em City, ça donne quoi ?
- Ça va se faire.
- Quand ?
Patience, Kenny. Patience.
J’emmerde la patience,
c’est tout ce que
tu sais dire, patience !
Patience !
Je passe assez de temps dans
cette saloperie pour être patient !
- Non, je ne le ferai pas.
- Pourquoi ?
Wangler m’a accusé de
l’avoir harcelé sexuellement.
- Je ne le veux pas près de moi.
- Wangler a admis
- qu’il avait exagéré son accusation.
- Exagéré ?
Écoute, Tim,
Adebisi m’a demandé
si Wangler,
Poet et Pierce pouvaient
retourner dans ton unité.
J’essaie de calmer
les tensions raciales.
Et si donner ça
à Adebisi peut aider,
je ne vois pas
le problème.
Si tu dis non,
je le transfèrerai quand même.
Très bien.
- Quoi de neuf ?
- Poupée.
Toujours la même merde.
Quoi de neuf ?
Bon retour.
Fais-moi voir le flingue.
Fais-moi voir le flingue.
Merde. Laisse-moi le tenir.
Laisse-moi le tenir.
Viens le chercher.
Vous avez été choisis
pour faire votre temps
dans une unité expérimentale,
Emerald City.
Ici, vous aurez plus de libertés
que dans le reste d’Oz,
mais la liberté a un prix.
Nous avons des règles.
Pas de cris,
de combats, de baise.
On attend de vous
de la retenue
et que les zones communes
restent sans tâches.
Vous obéissez aux règles,
tout se passera bien.
Sinon, on vous renvoie
d’où vous venez.
Ces gars-là vont
être vos sponsors,
pour vous acclimater
à votre nouvelle vie.
Augustus Hill,
voici Desmond Mobay.
Chucky Pancamo,
voici Ralph Galino.
et Guillaume Tarrant,
voici Jaz Hoyt.
C’est une blague.
Tu viens d’où ?
La Jamaïque ?
Oui.
- T’es aux US depuis quand ?
- Six mois.
Qu’est-ce qui t’amène à Oz ?
T’écris l’histoire de ma vie ?
- J’te connais pas.
- Comme on a dit, je suis Ralph Galino.
Je sais pas qui t’es
ou d’où tu viens.
Je suis entrepreneur. J’ai construit
un complexe qui s’est effondré,
ça a tué deux personnes,
mais c’est pas ma faute.
- T’as pas de connections ?
- Connections ?
- Ouais, quelqu’un entoure ?
- Oh, non.
Avant ce bordel, j’ai même
jamais eu une prune.
- Ah ouais ?
- Sans vouloir vous offenser,
tous les italo-américains
sont pas des mafieux.
- Vraiment ?
- La majorité respecte la loi.
Le mafieux est un stéréotype
laid et injuste.
Alors c’est qui ?
Juste un autre putain
de connard.
Eh, toi !
T’as du fric ? Donne.
Espèce de tapette.
Tout le monde à Oz
a un job qui peut aller
de la maintenance
à la cantine ou la mécanique.
Tu as une expérience
de secrétariat,
le directeur voudrait que
tu travailles dans son bureau.
- OK.
- T’as fait dans la drogue.
C’est du passé, ça.
Ouais, ouais. Au cas où,
tu vas suivre le programme
de désintoxication,
au moins pendant
quelques semaines.
Tu ne fourres
ton nez nulle part,
au propre comme au figuré,
et on s’entendra bien.
Va chez le directeur.
Suivant !
Oui ?
M. le directeur,
voici Desmond Mobay.
- Vous pouvez le laisser, Armstrong.
- Bien, Monsieur.
- Agent Basil.
- Monsieur le directeur.
Asseyez-vous.
Chouette petite prison
que vous dirigez là.
Petite ?
Oz est la plus grande
maison de correction de l’État.
Et pourtant c’est tellement
intime et amical.
Je dois vous dire que le problème
de drogue ici est majeur,
mais je suis pas sûr de l’efficacité
d’une opération secrète.
On a déjà eu un agent
des stupéfiants ici.
- Paul Markstrom.
- Oui.
Je connaissais Paul.
Quelqu’un de bien.
Alors vous savez
aussi qu’il a été exécuté.
- Pendu.
- Les risques du métier.
Je compte vous
surveiller de près.
C’est pour ça que
je vous voulais dans ce bureau.
- Je veux être informé en permanence.
- Pas de problème.
Je vais vous montrer
votre bureau.
C’est peut-être le bazar.
Mon dernier secrétaire est parti
un peu dans l’urgence.
Très sympa.
Je peux envoyer
des emails à mon partenaire.
Au fait, je tape
85 mots par minute.
Je vais pouvoir vous embaucher
comme secrétaire.
Si je loupe ce coup,
j’aurai besoin du job.
Mon lieutenant veut
voir des résultats.
Vous allez
commencer par quoi ?
Faire ami-ami
avec les méchants.
Salut, comment ça va ?
De la lecture culturelle, hein ?
Quoi, d’un seul coup
tu veux faire copain copain ?
J’ai dû faire erreur.
On m’a dit que t’étais cool.
- Ah oui ?
- On m’a aussi dit
que tu savais où trouver
un peu d’aide.
- De l’aide ou de l’herbe ?
- Pareil.
Même si j’aimerais
quelque chose de plus fort.
Je sais pas
avec qui tu causes,
mais ils sont mal informés,
je fais pas dans la drogue.
- Non ?
- Plus maintenant.
Alors, à qui je dois parler ?
Bouge pas,
ils viendront à toi.
Salut, chérie, c’est moi.
Comment je vais ?
Comment tu crois que je vais ?
Écoute, appelle Dan Bosey,
dis-lui de se bouger le cul.
Je veux que mon appel
soit approuvé.
Il faut que je sorte d’ici.
Moi aussi, je t’aime.
OK, salut.
Tu veux quoi ?
Permettez-moi de me présenter.
Nikolai Petrovic Stanislofsky.
- OK, tu veux quoi ?
- Ce portable.
Comment vous avez
réussi à le faire entrer ici ?
Mon frère me l’a apporté,
pourquoi ?
Ils ne sont pas autorisés.
Vraiment ?
Personne ne me l’a dit.
On doit utiliser
les téléphones payants.
Parce qu’ils surveillent
les appels au hasard,
et l’État a un deal avec
la compagnie du téléphone
pour tous les appels
longue distance.
Merde, je devrais le rendre.
Je n’ai pas besoin
de nouvelles emmerdes.
Vous savez, je peux
m’en occuper à votre place.
Je peux dire que
j’ai trouvé le portable
et personne n’en saura rien.
C’est comme vous voulez.
Merci.
Comment tu t’appelles ?
- Nikolai.
- Ralph.
- Merci.
- Y’a pas de quoi.
Je ferais mieux de prendre
aussi le chargeur.
Prisonnier numéro
00T416, Guillaume Tarrant.
Condamné le 2 janvier 2000.
Destruction de propriété privée,
dissimulation d’arme.
Sentence : 10 ans.
Liberté conditionnelle dans trois ans.
Eh toi, ça va, toi ?
Bienvenue à Em City.
Sympa, les chaussures.
C’est ta mère qui te les a données
avant de t’envoyer en colo ?
Fous-moi la paix.
C’est quoi cet accent ?
T’es d’où ?
Fous-moi la paix.
Eh, je fais juste
la conversation.
Je suis juste sympa, quoi.
Tu vas où ?
Hein, tu vas où ?
Eh, pose ton sale
petit cul blanc ici.
Tes chaussures,
offre-les moi.
- Quoi ?
- Offre-les moi.
Allez.
Tu veux mes chaussures ?
Plus fort.
Tu veux mes chaussures ?
Plus fort,
fils de pute, plus fort.
Prends mes chaussures,
s’il te plaît !
Super, un cadeau
pour moi ? Vraiment ?
Laisse-moi prendre
ces chaussures.
Laisse-moi voir.
Ce sont des vraies de vraies.
C’est ma taille et tout.
Trop cool.
Super, vraiment. Merci.
OK, ouais, trop belles.
Merci, hein, c’est sympa.
A plus, OK ?
Et ils les ont prises.
Tiens, mouche-toi.
Guillaume, y’a un problème.
Si je répète à Wangler
ce que tu viens de me dire,
il va nier.
Sa parole contre la tienne.
Il aura Poet et Pierce
pour le soutenir.
T’as besoin d’une preuve
ou d’un témoin.
Il porte mes chaussures.
C’est une preuve.
Mais tu dois trouver quelqu’un
qui dira qu’il t’a vu
les porter avant.
- Tu peux faire ça ?
- Non.
Tous les témoins diront
qu’ils t’ont entendu
les offrir à Wangler.
- Je fais quoi, alors ?
- Appelle ta famille.
- Qu’ils t’en envoient une autre paire.
- Wangler les piquera aussi.
Probablement.
Écoute...
Je n’aime pas que ces trois-là
traînent dans le coin non plus.
Si tu vois ou entends
quoi que ce soit
que je puisse utiliser
contre eux, dis-le moi.
Pour l’instant, va à l’infirmerie,
dis-leur que je t’envoie,
prends des chaussons
qui feront l’affaire jusqu’à...
Eh, la Marseillaise !
On joue tous les deux ?
- Non, merci.
- Je demande pas ton avis.
C’est comme ça qu’on fait.
- Ça doit être les chaussures.
- Ouais, c’est ça.
Bon match.
- Eh, McManus.
- J’ai pas le temps, O’Reily.
Tu devrais transférer
la Marseillaise ailleurs.
Depuis quand tu me dis
qui vit ici ou pas ?
Si tu ne fais rien,
il va y avoir des problèmes.
Ouais, merci pour le conseil.
J’ai appris ce que
ces nègres t’ont fait.
- Dégage.
- Eh...
C’est pour toi.
- Du shit ?
- Oui, et un petit bonus
qu’on appelle
« poudre magique ».
Tu veux pas
attendre un peu ?
S’ils te voient,
ils vont te bouffer tout cru.
OK ?
La vie à Oz, ça craint.
Si tu veux survivre,
il faut que tu montres
à Wangler et sa bande
qu’ils peuvent pas
te traiter comme ça.
Comment je fais ça ?
J’en sais rien.
Mais si une chance
se présente, saisis-la,
parce que t’en auras
pas une deuxième.
Le plus flippant
avec ces criminels
qu’on a emprisonnés
dans les années 80...
pendant les folles
années Reagan...
tous ces criminels,
ils arrivent en fin de peine.
Ces criminels qui sont
plus dangereux maintenant
qu’ils ne l’étaient en arrivant,
ils sortent...
pour vous attendre
dans un coin de rue sombre.
Extinction des feux !
Beecher.
- Ton nom ?
- Tarrant, Guillaume Tarrant.
T’es le mec
qui a détruit la statue ?
- Oui.
- Espèce de détraqué.
Elle est rapide, ta mère.
- Elle t’envoie ça par avion ?
- Foutez-moi la paix.
Comment tu parles ?
Faut pas dire de gros mots.
- Ta maman serait furax.
- Foutez-moi la paix.
Quoi, tu joues au méchant ?
Hein ? Tu vas faire quoi, hein ?
Hein, hein ?
Baissez-vous,
baissez-vous...
Oh ! Putain !
Chris !
Allez, baisse ton arme.
Tu peux pas sortir,
baisse ton arme.
Tu peux pas sortir.
Les nécrologies.
Un homme ou une femme
vivent leur vie entière.
Ils travaillent, aiment,
rêvent et rient et pleurent.
Puis ils meurent.
Et puis un total inconnu,
qui ne les a jamais rencontrés,
réduit leur vie entière
à un paragraphe ou deux
dans un journal local.
Et ça, seulement s’ils ont
accompli quelque chose...
quelque chose d’important
aux yeux de l’éditeur.
Si ce sont
des personnages influents,
ils auront peut-être
deux colonnes.
Peut-être même
une vieille photo.
S’ils n’ont rien accompli,
on les enterre
en bas de page.
Ou on les ignore complètement.
La section criminelle
a fini son enquête.
Guillaume Tarrant a tiré sur sept
personnes avant de se tuer.
Quatre personnes sont mortes.
L’agent Joseph Howard,
et les détenus Lou Wrath,
Junior Pierce et Kenny White.
Comment vont les autres détenus,
Keller, Seran et Ahmad ?
Ils sont tous
à Mission Memorial.
Seran et Ahmad avaient
des blessures superficielles.
Ils devraient revenir aujourd’hui, mais
Keller avait des blessures internes.
Il va être à l’hôpital
pour un moment.
Je me demande bien
d’où sortait ce pistolet.
Je sais pas.
Mais j’suis certain
qu’on va finir par le savoir.
On sait pas
d’où venait le pistolet.
Pourquoi nous demander ? C’était
le doigt d’un blanc sur la gâchette.
Je parle à tout le monde.
Que vous découvriez
la vérité ou non,
une chose est claire.
C’est la zizanie
à Emerald City.
McManus doit dégager.
Tu me dis qui embaucher
ou renvoyer, Adebisi ?
Je montre juste
la réalité du doigt.
McManus a été négligent.
La responsabilité ultime
est sienne.
Vous feriez bien d’agir vite.
La presse veut des réponses.
- Le public veut quelqu’un à blâmer.
- Merci pour votre intérêt.
Vous avez l’air bien copains.
Une telle entente,
c’est rare.
Tu veux pas
que McManus soit viré ?
Tu vois ?
Qu’est-ce qui se passe ?
Qu’est-ce que
t’en as à faire ?
T’as bien perdu
le goût du pouvoir, non ?
- Ouais.
- Te mêle pas de ça.
Commencement du jour,
le chemin vers la sagesse,
le désir, la volonté de traiter,
de trébucher.
Vous pouvez commémorer
les garde-chiourmes.
Mais mes frères, ils sont sur le dos,
dans les coins comme des cafards
- après avoir été vaporisés au Raid ?
- Allez, ça suffit !
L’arrière de la cuisse,
la lueur dans l’oeil...
Poet, Poet.
- Ça suffit.
- T’approche pas de moi, putain.
Tu sais, Bricks
et Junior sont morts.
- Morts !
- Toi et moi on est vivants.
Ils n’avaient pas de coeur.
Moi, j’ai un cœur.
J’ai un cœur de lion.
Au lieu de pleurer sur Kenny et Junior,
aide-moi à les venger.
Vengeance contre qui, Adebisi ?
Tarrant s’est buté
lui-même.
Contre eux, tu vois.
Tous ces salauds de blancs.
C’est pas un putain
de salaud de blanc
qui m’a détruit la face
a coup de soupe chaude.
C’était toi.
C’était toi !
Ça, c’est du passé.
C’est le présent maintenant.
T’étais un pouce de plus à gauche
quand il s’est mis à tirer,
et tu serais mort, et Kenny Wangler
serait mon meilleur ami.
Il se passe quelque chose.
Ouais, mais quoi ? On est à l’extérieur,
le nez contre la vitre.
Ouais, pas pour longtemps,
mon frère.
Les garde-chiourmes
cherchent l’origine pistolet.
Tu sais qui l’avait ?
Ce putain de chocolat, Adebisi.
Je l’ai vu avec le pistolet
le jour avant la fusillade.
Adebisi sait
que tu sais ?
Pas encore. Il va probablement
le découvrir assez tôt.
L’intégrité...
c’est ce qui sépare les vrais leaders
des politiciens typiques.
L’un des candidats au poste de
gouverneur a une intégrité réelle.
Alvah Case.
Avocat activiste,
Doyen d’école de droit,
Président du Barreau.
Personne ne doute
de son intégrité.
Alors après les émeutes
à la prison d’Oswald,
vers qui James Devlin s’est tourné
pour remettre l’ordre ?
C’est exact. Alvah Case.
Une intégrité indéniable,
au service du changement.
Wendy.
Il faut se débarrasser
de McManus.
- C’est le thème de la semaine.
- Vous avez lu la Tribune ?
Première page,
partie supérieure.
« Fusillade à la prison, quatre morts »
et deux articles de l’éditeur.
Un peu de mauvaise presse
me fait pas peur.
Pas si vous voulez être
gouverneur adjoint.
Il faut un bouc émissaire,
il faut virer McManus.
- C’est pas le moment.
- Il foire depuis le début.
- Vous avez oublié les émeutes ?
- C’était pas sa faute.
Toute cette histoire d’Emerald City
a été un désastre.
C’est un gauchiste efféminé
et vous devez le balancer
aux ordures.
Votre courrier.
De rien.
« Cher Tim, je sais que
quand tu recevras ceci,
la sœur Pete
t’aura annoncé
que je ne reviendrai pas à Oz.
Tout cela doit
te sembler irréel.
Ça l’est pour moi,
c’est sûr.
A mon départ en vacances,
il y a 15 jours,
j’aurais jamais rêvé
que ma vie entière
pourrait changer
aussi radicalement.
Je n’avais pas imaginé rencontrer un
homme comme Cary, aussi affectueux,
aussi compréhensif ».
On m’a demandé
de choisir un employé
pour faire partie
d’une délégation d’État
qui va aller
en Afrique du Sud
pour un débat certaines questions
des droits de l’homme.
Ce groupe visitera
la prison de Pretoria,
la prison de Sonderwater,
et fera aussi...
- un safari.
- Pardon.
Leo, je veux juste
parler une minute.
- J’ai déjà commencé.
- Juste une minute
à propos du service
pour l’agent Howard.
C’est important, bordel,
parce qu’il a été tué
juste devant moi.
Bien, allez-y.
Ok...
nous devrions
filmer la cérémonie
pour que plus tard,
ses petits enfants
puissent la voir.
Accorde-lui le repos éternel,
Oh Seigneur.
Et que la lumière perpétuelle
l’éclaire d’en haut.
Amen.
Tim McManus voudrait
dire quelques mots.
Tim ?
Joe adorait parier
sur les chevaux.
Alors en son honneur, j’aimerais...
 ? Les dames de Camptown
chantent cette chanson ?
 ? Doo da doo da ?
 ? Le champ de courses de Camptown
fait cinq miles de long ?
 ? Oh doo da day ?
 ? J’vais courir
toute la nuit ?
 ? J’vais courir
tout le jour ?
 ? Parier mon argent
sur une veille bourrique ?
 ? Quelqu’un parie
sur le bey. ?
Entrez.
Leo, nous voulons
vous parler de Tim.
J’ai eu assez de discussions
- à son sujet.
- Il est perturbé.
- Oui.
- Il a besoin d’aide.
- C’est ce que je lui ai dit.
- Vous l’avez vu ?
- Nous le cherchons partout.
- Il vient de partir.
- Où est-il allé ?
- Aucune idée.
On l’appellera
chez lui ce soir.
- Sinon, on le verra ici demain.
- D’accord.
- Ça m’étonnerait.
- Pourquoi ?
Je viens de le virer.
Bonsoir.
J’ai vu la nécrologie
d’un type que je connaissais.
Et ils avaient mal épelé
son nom dans le journal.
Ils ont fait une faute
dans son putain de nom.
Et y’a pas
de retour en arrière.
C’est pas comme s’ils allaient
bien épeler son nom
la prochaine fois
qu’il meurt. Non.
Cet exemplaire du journal
va aller aux archives.
Et ce type que je connais...
son nom,
sans doute la chose
dont il est le plus fier,
il sera erroné.
A jamais.
Bon.
Écoutez bien,
tout le monde.
Hier soir...
Tim McManus a démissionné
d’Emerald City.
Bien, calmez-vous !
En attendant un nouveau
chef de quartiers,
le directeur m’a demandé
de reprendre temporairement
les fonctions de McManus.
Écoutez-bien : rien...
rien ne va changer.
Ouais, c’est ce que
tu penses.
Bien, c’est tout !
Agent Murphy ?
Vous avez des nouvelles
de Chris Keller ?
Rien de nouveau.
- Vous pourriez appeler et voir...
- Beecher,
y’a eu un gros problème ici.
Et Tim McManus qui part.
La santé de ton p’tit copain
c’est pas une
de mes priorités.
- S’il vous plait ?
- Va-t’en.
J’ai demandé à mon père de trouver
l’autre fils de Schillinger.
Oz n’a pas fait de toi
une salope.
Tu es né comme ça.
- Ouais, OK.
- Viens là.
Tu es tourmenté par ton rôle
dans la mort d’Andrew Schillinger.
Tu te cherchais
et tu es venu à moi.
Tu as demandé
à être guidé par l’islam.
Tu as cherché le réconfort.
La paix intérieure en Allah.
Mais il y a cette...
chose entre toi et Keller.
Les actes homosexuels
sont blasphème.
Je sais.
Je veux l’aimer, Kareem.
Vraiment.
Et pour Allah,
je tenterai ma chance avec Lui
quand ce sera le moment.
Beecher.
Désolé pour ton
copain de baise.
Vu le genre, il a probablement déjà
baisé la moitié des infirmières
et deux aides-soignants.
J’espère qu’il va pas te ramener
une infection du personnel.
- Toby.
- Papa.
Bonne nouvelle.
Au fait, nous avons trouvé
Hank Schillinger.
Bon Dieu, c’était rapide.
J’te l’avais dit,
Swannee est le meilleur.
Et si tu soulèves la bonne pierre,
tu trouves un ver de terre.
C’est à dire ?
Hank Schillinger est un gosse
complètement paumé.
D’après Swanne, il est...
drogué, voleur
à la petite semaine.
Il a prostitué sa copine.
Quand va-t-il venir
voir Schillinger ?
Y’a une petite complication.
Il dit qu’il ne viendra pas
sans être payé.
Combien ?
Je sais pas.
Probablement le prix
de sa prochaine dose.
Conclus le marché.
- Toby...
- Fais-le, Papa.
Vern.
Qu’est-ce que vous voulez,
bon Dieu ?
Vous avez de la visite.
Vous prenez mes rendez-vous
maintenant ?
Hank est ici.
Hank ?
Mon Hank ?
Ton père arrive.
Quand est-ce que j’aurai
le reste du fric ?
Quand tu auras fini.
Cool.
Alors amenez-le.
Ça va prendre longtemps ?
Parce que j’ai
quelqu’un à voir.
T’as l’air en forme, mec.
Bonjour, mon fils.
Super mince.
Ils te donnent pas
à manger ici ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
C’est bon de te voir.
Laisse-moi te regarder.
Comment tu vas ?
J’veux dire à propos d’Andrew ?
Il me manque.
Mais avant
qu’il se fasse descendre,
on passait plus tellement
de temps ensemble.
Tous les zarbis
avec lesquels il était,
à traîner un nègre
derrière une camionnette ?
C’est quoi cette merde ?
Viens, assieds-toi.
J’ai tellement à te dire.
J’aimerais bien, mais faut
que j’me casse.
Tu viens juste d’arriver.
Hank.
Oh, et puis j’m’en fous.
J’ai le temps.
Après tout,
t’es mon papa.
Ça s’est bien passé ?
C’était bizarre au début,
mais Hank a fini
par se calmer.
- Et Schillinger ?
- Je ne l’ai jamais vu vraiment heureux.
Mais il avait l’air de l’être.
Il a demandé à Hank
de revenir.
Il a dit oui, mais
qui sait s’il reviendra.
Je vais m’assurer que oui.
Vous savez,
le plus surprenant pour moi,
c’est combien Schillinger
aime ce gamin.
- Mon Père.
- Ouais ?
Vous avez déjà
trop aimé quelqu’un ?
Bien sûr.
C’est pas permis.
Y’a le célibat.
Ma question c’est,
est-ce que c’est mal
de trop aimer quelqu’un ?
Tout dépend
comment l’amour se manifeste.
Et la réponse à votre
première question est...
oui, ça m’est arrivé.
C’est triste de voir quelqu’un
qui a eu qu’une seule merde dans sa vie.
A part cette merde
qui a tout foutu en l’air,
il menait une bonne vie normale.
Mais un incident
ou un autre,
une mauvaise décision
ou une mauvaise action qui lui a valu
un moment de notoriété,
deviendra le titre de sa nécro
quand il mourra.
Vous savez, comme
Charles van Doren.
« Scandale du Jeu Télévisé »
Quoi qu’il ait fait d’autre,
c’est comme ça qu’on
se souviendra de lui,
pour toujours.
Pardon.
- C’est la tienne ?
- Ma copine.
Ah ouais ?
Ma femme.
Le capitaine veut
savoir où t’en es.
Il veut savoir quand
il verra des arrestations.
La fusillade a tout mis
au point mort.
Deux de mes contacts
pour la drogue se sont fait tuer.
Prends ton temps, partenaire.
Je sais.
Je sais.
Mais j’aime autant te dire
que j’veux pas passer plus
de temps ici que nécessaire.
Ma femme me manque
tout le temps.
Et ces temps-ci...
j’ai l’impression
de la perdre.
Tu penses qu’elle
couche avec un autre ?
Non, je deviens juste
de moins en moins
important pour elle.
Elle remplit le vide
que j’ai laissé derrière moi.
Ça pourrait pas nous arriver
à Kina et moi.
- Non ?
- Non.
Ouais, on verra.
Elle est d’où ?
Washington.
Vraiment ?
Pourquoi ?
J’ai l’impression
de l’avoir déjà vue.
J’essayais de me souvenir où.
- Elle est ici depuis longtemps ?
- Six mois environ.
Je l’ai jamais vue alors.
OK, OK.
Eh, Kina,
t’as déjà eu affaire
à un certain Augustus Hill ?
Ouais, c’est ce que je pensais.
Il dit qu’il te reconnaît.
Je crois que par prudence, tu devrais
pas venir pendant un moment.
Tu sais, en Jamaïque,
j’étais dans le business.
- Ouais ?
- T’as peut-être une place pour moi.
Tellement de tes hommes
ont été tués.
J’vais en parler.
M. Adebisi.
Belle île,
- la Jamaïque.
- Tu y es allé ?
C’est moi qui pose
les questions.
Compris.
Comment va Junior Numbah ?
Je sais qui c’est,
mais on a jamais
dansé ensemble.
Marco Sauri ?
Même chose.
William Pouches ?
Lui, j’le connais
pas du tout.
C’est parce que
je l’ai inventé.
Tu connais Aylum King ?
A peine.
Alors qui tu connais ?
Qui peut te servir
de référence ?
Nesta Parks.
Nesta Parks ?
Il est à Levin.
Il fait ses 15 ans.
Tu peux partir.
Donne-moi une chance
de faire mes preuves.
Pars.
Poet,
contacte Nesta Parks.
J’veux en savoir plus
sur notre nouveau singe.
- Le procès commence aujourd’hui.
- Oui.
Et j’ai l’intention
d’aller au tribunal
chaque jour jusqu’à
ce qu’on obtienne justice.
Et tu es certaine
qu’on va l’obtenir.
J’ai un bon pressentiment.
Je crois qu’on va gagner.
Je crois que l’État
et cette prison
et Devlin vont finalement
devoir réaliser
qu’après toutes ces années,
ils sont responsables
de l’émeute.
Il sont responsables
pour tous les détenus
qui ont été blessés.
Et les hommes,
comme mon frère,
qui sont morts.
Tu te moques de moi ?
Non.
Je pense à la petite fille
effrayée que tu étais.
Et je suis stupéfait.
Je suis très content
de tous ces changements en toi.
Je veux t’embrasser.
J’aimerais que l’on puisse.
Tu sais quoi ?
Tout ce que
je respecte en toi
me fait aussi
vraiment chier.
OK. Je vous ai tous
demandé de venir
car en tant que
co-plaignants,
je vais vous faire
une mise à jour
sur la plainte déposée
contre l’État.
Ouais, ouais, ouais.
On a vu ça aux infos.
Quand est-ce qu’on aura
notre putain d’argent ?
Comme je le disais, O’Reily,
c’est pas une histoire d’argent.
Il s’agit que l’État admette
sa culpabilité par rapport à l’émeute.
Pardon, chacun de nous
va témoigner ?
J’en doute.
J’ai toutes vos dépositions.
Et d’après notre avocat,
Arnie Zelman,
un seul de nous suffit
pour plaider notre cause
devant le tribunal.
Et ce serait toi.
Oui.
Je pars dans une heure.
Il a fallu tous ces mois
pour que le procès commence.
Faut longtemps pour qu’un jury
rende son verdict ?
Je dirais une semaine environ.
T’es optimiste.
Considérant que
le système légal américain
est fondamentalement corrompu,
injuste, chaotique...
en effet.
Je suis très optimiste.
- Remportez-le.
- Kareem.
- Non, je refuse absolument.
- C’est une nouvelle mesure d’État.
Si un prisonnier sort
d’un établissement,
il ou elle doit mettre
une combinaison orange.
Si je le porte au tribunal,
que pensera le jury ?
Il me verront
comme un criminel.
Et c’est quelqu’un
qu’on ne doit pas croire.
Vous ne pouvez pas
quitter Oz sans ça.
Allez devant
le conseil des prisons.
- Obtenez une dérogation.
- J’ai essayé.
Alors portez plainte
contre eux.
C’est ça, et le juge Dolov
repoussera le procès, ou pas.
Pour sur, les chicanes légales
vont prendre du temps.
Vous vouliez en finir
le plus vite possible.
Ce que je veux ?
Je veux que ce procès
soit fait correctement.
OK.
Je vais déposer
les motions nécessaires.
- Eh.
- Déjà de retour ?
Ouais. Il y a eu
une complication.
Y’en a toujours
avec toi.
Que veux-tu dire ?
Et bien, tu dis
que tu fais pas ça
pour l’argent et je te crois.
Tu dis que tu le fais
pour la justice
et je crois qu’il y a
autre chose.
Je crois que tu veux
qu’on perde ce procès.
Si je jury rejette
notre plainte,
tu pourras montrer du doigt
avec une indignation justifiée
un système
qui ne fonctionne pas.
Mais si nous gagnons,
qu’auras-tu ?
Contre quoi
pourras-tu rager ?
Alors tu feras tout
pour trouver
une complication.
Je ne serai pas réduit
à l’état d’esclave
par les lois de cet État.
Ouais, ben, c’est là qu’on est
différents, toi et moi.
Parce que
j’adore la loi.
Même si elle n’a pas été
en ma faveur
et que je me suis
retrouvé ici,
je remercie Dieu chaque soir
pour nos lois.
Parce qu’elles gardent
des gens comme...
Adebisi et Hernandez
et Schillinger
loin de mes enfants.
Tu sais quoi ?
J’vais dire à Zelman
que si besoin est,
je vais témoigner
à ta place.
Beecher !
Le témoignage de Beecher
sur les abus corporels commis
par des gardes à Oswald
a stupéfait le jury.
- Regarde, c’est Beecher.
- Pourquoi c’est lui qui fait ça ?
D’après Beecher, même après
que le GIGN ait regagné le contrôle,
des prisonniers
ont été torturés.
Ici Kevin Gersten,
en direct du tribunal.
- Vous êtes Mme Lazarus ?
- Oui.
On m’a dit que quelqu’un
voulait me voir.
Je suis désolé,
je vous connais ?
Non. Oui.
J’étais l’un des jurés
à votre procès.
Vous êtes venue vous assurer
que l’on me punissait ?
Non, je...
Il y a quelque chose
qui me tourmente
depuis votre condamnation.
Vous me croyez innocent ?
Pas du tout.
Vous avez tué ce jeune,
coupé sa tête,
et tenté de l’expédier par la poste.
C’est ce qui rend
tout ça tellement difficile.
Je suis chrétienne.
Je sais la différence entre
la volonté de Dieu et le reste.
Chacun a droit
à un procès équitable,
c’est à dire être
jugé sans préjudice.
Madame, qu’est-ce que
vous bafouillez ?
Vous n’avez pas été jugé
sans préjudice.
Ensuite Mme Lazarus dit
qu’après que le jury fût isolé,
l’un des autres jurés,
un enculé de péquenaud,
a déclaré
à tout le monde,
« Ça devrait pas
prendre longtemps.
C’est une pédale.
Faut les exterminer ».
Ensuite il a commencé à intimider
les autres, accusant quiconque
voulait délibérer sur mon cas
d’être une pédale.
Elle dit qu’il les a tous fait
voter coupable,
pour la seule raison
que je suis homo.
- Bon Dieu.
- Qu’est-ce que tu vas faire ?
J’ai peut-être
une chance de faire
annuler le verdict.
Peut-être avoir
un nouveau procès.
Peut-être
foutre le camp d’ici.
Imam Said ?
On peut parler ?
De quoi pourrait-on bien
avoir à parler, toi et moi ?
Oh, parce que je suis pédé ?
Et que vous, les musulmans,
considérez l’homosexualité
comme une abomination ?
Oui.
C’est ça.
Dirais-tu que tu as
des préjugés contre moi ?
Non.
Je prie chaque jour
pour que les gens comme toi
trouvent le chemin vers Dieu.
A mon avis ça te rend
encore plus préjudiciable.
Est-ce que j’vais
demander à Allah
de faire de toi
une pédale, moi ?
Qu’est-ce que tu veux ?
La justice.
L’exécution de Shirley Bellinger
a été fixée
à jeudi en deux.
L’exécution nous attire
de l’attention excessive
de la part des médias,
des protestateurs.
Shirley est la première femme
à être exécutée
dans cet État depuis 1800...
quelque chose comme ça.
On va s’en prendre
plus que d’habitude.
- M. le directeur ?
- Ouais, Lopresti.
Si la télé vient
dans le couloir de la mort,
vous feriez bien de penser
à faire repeindre.
OK. Bien.
Quelqu’un va s’en charger.
Autre chose ?
Shirley.
Bonjour, agent Lopresti.
Et qui est
ce charmant monsieur ?
Ralph Galino.
Il va peindre ta cellule.
Enchantée.
A vrai dire,
j’suis en pétard.
Avant j’étais entrepreneur.
Des logements que j’ai construits
se sont écroulés,
tuant deux personnes,
mais c’était pas ma faute.
J’embauchais des peintres,
j’ai jamais peint.
Je sais par pourquoi le directeur
a décidé que j’étais qualifié.
Assez de discours, au travail.
Shirley, tu peux sortir.
- Sortir ?
- Ouais.
Le directeur a décidé
que tu es libre
de te promener ici jusqu’à
ce que Galino ait fini.
Dites à M. Glynn que je lui suis
très reconnaissante.
- Excuse-moi. Pardon.
- Pas de problème.
Je suis désolée.
Comment ça va
aujourd’hui, Nat ?
Très bien, mon petit agneau.
A quoi tu travailles ?
- Une nouvelle robe.
- Espèce de tantouse.
Oh, ça me fend le cœur.
Surtout venant d’un louf dingue
qui a assassiné sa famille.
- T’as assassiné ta famille ?
- Deux fois.
Prisonnier numéro 97M573,
Mark Miles.
Condamné le 10 juillet 1997.
Trois accusations d’assassinat.
Sentence : la peine de mort.
T’as tué ta famille deux fois ?
Ouah.
J’suis un amateur
à côté de toi.
Il y a 20 ans,
j’ai tué ma femme
et mon fils.
J’ai plaidé l’insanité et j’ai fait
10 ans à l’Institut Connelly.
- J’étais guéri.
- Putain de psycho.
On se fait salir
que par la merde, negro.
- M’appelle pas comme ça, putain.
- Va te faire enculer.
Allons, pas de grabuge. Attendez
au moins que je sois morte.
- Ils ont fixé la date ?
- Deux semaines.
Ça te fout pas
les boules ?
Non.
Après toutes les conneries,
le procès, les appels,
la fausse couche...
je suis prête à partir.
Je suis prête
à rencontrer mon Créateur.
Bien entendu, s’Il est prêt
pour quelqu’un comme moi,
c’est à voir.
Quand tu souris,
tu es très séduisant.
Pour un nègre ?
C’est vrai,
j’ai eu des préjugés.
Mais maintenant que
je suis si proche de la fin,
je vois qu’on est tous pareils.
Mêmes besoins,
mêmes désirs.
- Eh, Lopresti !
- Eh, eh, eh !
Qu’est-ce qui se passe ici ?
Juste un peu
de fraternisation.
C’est pas prévu
au programme.
- Fini.
- Bien. Entre.
Fais gaffe aux vapeurs,
ça fait tourner la tête.
J’attends que ça.
Pete, j’allais jute
venir vous voir.
Ah ouais ?
J’ai dîné avec les parents
de Preston hier soir.
Je les avais pas vus
depuis longtemps.
Bref, j’ai parlé de votre
programme d’interaction.
Vraiment ?
Comment ont-ils réagi ?
Patricia semblait plus intriguée
par cette idée que Lars.
Voulez-vous
que je les appelle ?
Non. Je les ai convaincus
de participer.
Vous ?
J’ai toujours eu
une très bonne relation avec eux.
Même si Preston avait épousé
quelqu’un en dehors de sa religion.
En dehors de sa tribu.
C’est drôle.
Pendant le dîner,
Patricia n’arrêtait pas de dire,
« C’est pas qu’on
vous blâme, Gloria ».
Ce qui bien entendu signifie qu’il me
blâment pour la mort de Preston.
Seulement ils sont trop coincés
pour une confrontation.
Puis j’ai réalisé
que je me blâme aussi.
Cyril, arrête.
Pose ça.
- Désolé.
- Pas de problème.
Cyril, vous comprenez que vous devrez
peut-être parler à la mère,
au père et à l’épouse
de votre victime ?
Oui.
Le Dr Nathan.
Je l’aime bien.
Quand vous allez
les rencontrer,
savez-vous ce que
vous aimeriez leur dire ?
Que...
que je veux
être leur ami.
Et vous, Ryan,
que voulez-vous dire ?
On est pas là pour moi.
On est ici pour le guérir
de ses cauchemars.
Non, non, non. On est ici
pour vous aider aussi.
Je pense que
vous pourriez parler
du diagnostic
de votre cancer du sein,
combien c’était effrayant,
combien Gloria a été gentille,
des sentiments que
vous avez nourris pour elle
et comment cela vous a conduit
à faire tuer Preston par Cyril.
Je l’aime toujours.
C’est vrai.
Et je l’aimerai toujours.
Putain !
Je comprends pas pourquoi
ça saigne toujours.
Le Dr Nathan devrait
regarder ça.
- Qu’en dites-vous ?
- Elle est sortie pour quelques heures.
J’vais voir si je peux trouver
le Dr Pistofnik.
Oh, merde.
Sœur Peter Marie,
je vous présente Lars
et Patricia Nathan.
Bonjour.
Soyez les bienvenus.
- Merci.
- Vous étiez aux funérailles de Preston ?
Oui. Nous avons
brièvement parlé.
Je n’étais pas sûre que
vous vous souviendriez.
Je me souviens de tout
ce qui concerne ce jour-là.
Asseyons-nous donc.
Quand Gloria nous a
demandé de venir ici,
je dois admettre
que j’étais sceptique.
Je ne suis pas sûr
du bien que ça fera.
Raviver tous
ces sentiments.
Ce qui compte, Lars,
c’est qu’en faisant face
aux assassins de votre fils,
vous ayez l’occasion
d’exprimer des choses
- que vous ne pourriez dire autrement.
- C’est ce que je lui ai dit.
Alors à partir de maintenant
jusqu’à ce moment-là,
nous aurons une série
d’entrevues pour vous préparer
à rencontrer
les frères O’Reily.
Par moments, le processus
pourra vous sembler lent,
frustrant,
même contre-productif...
Nous pouvons arrêter
à tout moment.
Oui, mais en fin de compte,
cette expérience
peut être très satisfaisante.
Commençons.
Quelle est la question
la plus importante
que vous voulez poser
à Cyril et Ryan ?
Pourquoi avez-vous
assassiné mon bébé ?
- Eh.
- Ryan ?
Pourquoi tu sers
de la cabine ?
Pour téléphoner.
Pourquoi tu te sers pas
du truc cellulaire ?
Tu veux dire un portable ?
Parce qu’ils sont interdits à Oz.
C’est contre la règle.
Alors pourquoi l’homme
qui parle bizarre en a un ?
Lequel ?
Tout le monde parle bizarre
dans ce taudis.
Lui.
Stanislofsky a un portable ?
- Je l’ai vu l’utiliser.
- Vraiment ?
...Putain.
Attends-moi ici, OK ?
Je reviens.
Nikolai.
Nikolai, Nikolai.
Comment ça va,
mon pote ?
O’Reily.
Toujours content de te voir.
Ouais. C’est ça.
Tu sais, un p’tit oiseau
m’a dit un secret sur toi
et je suis venu voir
si c’est vrai.
T’as un portable ?
Non.
Ben ça m’apprendra
à écouter les p’tits oiseaux.
Parce que si t’avais
un portable,
tu me laisserais l’emprunter.
Tu le partagerais, hein ?
Partager ?
Louer, peut-être.
Si j’en avais un,
et c’est pas le cas.
Je sais. Tu me l’as dit,
et je te crois.
Parce que
on se fait confiance.
Oui.
Absolument.
Désolé de t’avoir dérangé.
Pas de problème.
Salut, Nikolai.
Voilà, Niko.
Mange bien.
Eh, Pancamo.
Cyril est malade.
J’le remmène à Em City.
En plein milieu
du déjeuner ?
Si j’le remmène
pas maintenant,
il va dégobiller
dans ce saladier.
OK, OK.
Emmène-le de là.
Cyril. Ça va ?
Viens.
Comment tu te sens ?
Allez, viens.
Mais je...
J’me sens bien, Ryan.
Ferme-la.
Reste là. Dis-moi
si tu vois Stanislofsky.
Putain.
Putain d’enculé.
Où est ton putain
de téléphone ?
T’as pas pu
le trouver, hein ?
- Trouver quoi ?
- Le portable.
Portable ? Je croyais
que t’en avais pas.
C’est vrai.
Alors comment je pourrais chercher
un truc qui n’existe pas ?
Exactement.
- Quoi de neuf, pédale ?
- Va te faire foutre.
- Eh Ralph.
- Qu’est-ce que tu veux ?
Bon Dieu, on peut
pas juste être sympa ?
Ça fait des jours que je suis là,
et tu l’as pas été.
C’est pour ça que je suis là,
pour me rattraper.
J’peux m’asseoir ?
Bon Dieu, c’est de la merde
ce matelas.
C’est dur de s’habituer
à Oz, hein ?
Surtout avec la pédale
avec qui tu dors.
Hoyt ? C’est un porc.
Je sais pas pourquoi
ils m’ont mis ici
après la mort du Français.
Tu sais ce qui est
le plus dur ?
S’habituer à une vie
sans les à-côtés.
Je parle du sexe,
un bon cigare,
une bonne bouteille
de pinard, un portable.
Je savais pas que les portables
étaient interdits.
Stanislofsky me l’a dit.
T’as été élevé en Amérique ?
Ouais.
En grandissant, quel était
notre seul ennemi,
le pays auquel on a
jamais fait confiance ?
- La Russie.
- Ouais.
Stanislofsky, il est...
- Russe ?
- Exact.
Il t’a dit la vérité
pour les portables,
mais au lieu de rendre le tien,
il l’a gardé pour lui.
- Putain d’enculé.
- Si j’étais toi,
je reprendrais
ce qui m’appartient.
Eh, connard.
Rends-moi mon portable.
Baisse d’un ton.
Enculé.
J’le veux.
Tu crois que je le trimballe
avec moi ?
Il est caché.
Il me faut du temps.
OK.
J’veux l’avoir entre les mains
avant l’extinction des feux.
M. Pancamo.
J’ai une question.
Ralph Galino.
Un ami à toi ?
On se fréquente pas.
Alors s’il était malade,
ou blessé
dans un accident ?
J’me fous si cet enculé
vit ou meurt.
Tu vas où, putain ?
Me dis pas que Cyril est malade.
- Faut que je...
- Non,
tu retournes au boulot
sinon toi et ton frère
j’vous fais transférer
à la couture.
- Mais faut...
- Au putain de boulot.
Marché conclu.
Cet enculé !
Putain !
Tu cherches Galino ?
Il est parti se promener
avec Hoyt.
On dirait une overdose.
Emmenons-le
à la morgue.
Bien joué.
T’as couvert
toutes tes arrières,
t’as gardé les mains propres.
Personne sait pour le portable,
alors t’es pas suspect.
Pas mal.
Je t’ai sous-estimé,
et c’est pas mon habitude.
Écoute, on peut
faire durer le plaisir,
se faire la guerre,
sachant que je gagnerais.
Alors travaillons donc ensemble.
Comme la Russie est les USA.
Ça s’appelait comment déjà ?
La détente.
Détente.
Exactement.
Qu’est-ce que t’en dis ?
REGARDEZ CE QUE VOUS AVEZ FAIT !
Miguel.
Miguel ?
- Je suis où ?
- A l’hôpital.
Vous vous souvenez
de ce qui s’est passé ?
Vous avez été tous les deux
poignardés par William Giles.
Bevilacqua est mort.
Je me suis promis de plus jamais
me faire planter,
et ce p’tit cinglé
de Giles m’a eu.
C’est quoi ça ?
Procédure normale
pour quelqu’un en isolement.
Putain, tu me déçois.
Pourquoi, El Cid ?
Je t’ai demandé de tuer
Miguel Alvarez.
- Il est mort ?
- Non.
J’aime pas ce mot.
Carlos Martinez est voisin
de lit avec Alvarez.
Mais il a du mal
à trouver une arme.
Rien à foutre qui
est dans le lit à côté,
démerde-toi pour que ce soit fait
ou je trouve un autre lieutenant.
Barre-toi de là, maintenant.
Tu t’amuses bien ?
Comment ça va, Alvarez ?
J’ai appris ce qui s’est passé.
- Comment ça va à Emerald City ?
- C’est effrayant.
J’ai tout le temps peur.
Qu’est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Creuser.
Quoi ?
Creuser.
Tu creuses un autre tunnel ?
J’ai presque fini.
T’es complètement cinglé.
Tu diras ça demain...
à mon dos.
Prisonnier numéro 98M232,
Carlos Martinez.
Condamné le 6 octobre 1998.
Deux accusations d’assassinat.
Sentence :
Emprisonnement à perpétuité.
Putain ! Au secours !
Au secours !
Pose ça, Martinez !
Y’a pas d’issue,
alors pose ta lame !
Va te faire enculer, pute.
A terre, enculé !
Dénombrement !
88K214,
95H522,
96G415,
98T304,
65R814,
98B242.
98B242 !
- Il est où, Rebadow ?
- J’sais pas.
Te fous pas de moi.
Vous êtes joints au cerveau.
- Où est Busmalis ?
- J’ai vraiment aucune idée.
Regarde dans le registre.
Il était au dernier appel ?
Équipe de ménage...
- Nettoyage à l’hôpital.
- J’vais aller voir.
Busmalis, où es-tu ?
Super !
Vraiment super !
214 à poste central.
Nous avons
un 69 à l’hôpital.
Bien reçu, terminé.
En fin de compte, peu importe ce
qu’ils écrivent dans votre nécrologie,
parce que vous serez pas là
pour la lire.
L’encre des journaux s’efface,
le papier se désintègre.
Faut que l’empreinte que vous laissez
derrière vous soit plus profonde.
Faut que l’empreinte
que vous laissez
soit sur l’âme
d’une autre personne.
La Déclaration des droits,
ces premiers 10 amendements
à la Constitution,
c’est nous, les USA,
qui les avons inventés.
Avant que nos pères fondateurs
ne trempent leurs plumes
dans l’encrier et écrivent
la Déclaration des droits,
aucun autre pays
n’avait jamais défini
la responsabilité d’un gouvernement
envers son peuple,
la responsabilité primordiale
étant de protéger la liberté.
Liberté !
Bien entendu, il y en a qui prennent
toutes sortes de libertés
avec la liberté.
Hier, un peu avant 5h00,
deux prisonniers se
sont évadés par un tunnel
sous le mur au sud-est
de la prison.
Miguel Alvarez, la trentaine,
latino-américain,
et Agamemnon Busmalis, la
cinquantaine, de race blanche.
Nous ne pensons pas
qu’ils soient armés.
Cependant, Alvarez est considéré
comme dangereux.
Alvarez !
Je veux assurer la population
qu’un effort coordonné
est fourni par le personnel
du directeur Glynn, la police locale
et les CRS pour localiser et
appréhender ces criminels.
Directeur Glynn ?
Combien de temps leur a-t-il fallu
pour creuser ce tunnel ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Peut-on supposer plus d’un jour ?
- Oui.
- Plus d’une semaine ?
- Oui.
- Et personne n’a rien vu ?
Busmalis est un prisonnier
à faible risque
qui ne manifeste
aucune agressivité,
et à qui nous avons
donné plus de liberté
que nous n’aurions dû.
Vous dites qu’Alvarez
est dangereux ?
Il a des antécédents violents,
mais il est
sous traitement médical.
Eh, Hernandez,
on dirait que t’as raté
ta chance de tuer Alvarez.
Tu ferais bien de fermer
ta putain de gueule, Adebisi.
Ces foutus journalistes.
Vous vous en êtes bien sorti, Leo,
tout compte fait.
Merci pour votre soutien.
Les gens adorent une évasion
de prison. C’est sexy, excitant.
Ils veulent que les évadés
finissent par se faire prendre.
Nous savons où sont leurs famille,
qui sont leurs amis,
nous surveillons tous les avions,
trains et routes principales.
- Nous allons les attraper.
- Je l’espère,
parce que sinon,
vos chances de devenir
gouverneur adjoint sont nulles.
Vous n’aviez aucune idée que
Busmalis travaillait sur ce tunnel ?
Non. A vrai dire,
je suis vexé de ne pas
avoir été invité.
Alvarez ne vous a jamais
parlé de s’évader ?
Quand ? Il passe d’isolement
cellulaire à l’hôpital.
Allons, Hernandez, vous détestez
Alvarez autant que moi.
- Aidez-moi à le ramener.
- Je sais que dalle.
Fais passer le mot.
Quand Alvarez se pointe,
qu’on lui arrache le cœur
et qu’on le lui enfile
dans son putain de cul.
Allez.
Alvarez.
J’vais te tuer.
- J’vais te tuer.
- Non.
J’vais te tuer.
J’vais te tuer.
Adebisi, t’es bien
hardi aujourd’hui.
Toujours !
Tu le seras pas autant quand j’aurai
parlé aux garde-chiourmes.
- De quoi ?
- Que t’as donné le flingue au Français.
Le directeur veut savoir comment
il a pu tuer quatre types.
Si je lui dis que c’est toi
le responsable,
tu vas te retrouver avec une
condamnation à mort au cul, mon pote.
Si tu leur dis que c’était moi,
j’leur dirai que c’était toi.
C’est ça. On verra
qui il croit.
Alors Adebisi a donné
le pistolet à Tarrant ?
Ouais. Il voulait
qu’un blanc tue un noir.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pourquoi ? Pour mettre la pagaille.
Une dernière question...
Qui a donné le pistolet
à Adebisi ?
Sortez.
Qui ?
- Hughes.
- Hughes ?
Clayton Hughes ?
Le jour où vous l’avez viré.
Oh, merde.
Leo, qu’est-ce qui se passe ?
Votre message disait
de venir tout de suite ?
Regarde-toi...
On dirait un zoulou.
Qu’est-ce qui se passe ?
Juste là.
Juste là.
Ouais, je sais, c’est là
que mon père est mort.
Poignardé par un prisonnier.
Un prisonnier blanc.
Clayton,
je vais te demander
quelque chose
et je veux que tu me dises,
sur l’âme de ton père,
la vérité absolue.
C’est moi qui ai donné
le pistolet à Adebisi.
- Ça va mieux ?
- Non.
Dès que j’ai entendu votre voix
au téléphone, j’ai su que vous saviez.
A cause de moi,
quatre noirs sont morts.
- La ferme, Clayton.
- Écoutez...
Ne dis rien de plus. Ne dis pas
un autre foutu mot.
Agent Mineo.
Écoute, on va
te prendre un avocat,
et d’ici là, je ne veux pas
que tu parles à qui que ce soit.
- Compris ?
- Je suis coupable.
Clayton, j’essaie
de te protéger.
Eh, Clayton,
comment ça va ?
- Arrêtez-le.
- Quoi ?
J’ai dit, arrêtez-le.
Oui, Hughes
m’a donné le pistolet.
Et vous l’avez
donné à Tarrant ?
Non. Cet enculé l’a volé
dans ma cellule.
Emmenez-le au trou.
Prisonnier numéro 00M871,
Enrique Morales,
condamné le 6 avril 2000,
pour homicide volontaire.
Peine : 25 ans,
dont 15 fermes.
Hernandez, Adebisi
et moi, on vend de la came.
Je sais.
Hernandez fait une
dépression nerveuse.
- Ça aussi, j’le sais.
- On veut pas d’un partenaire fou.
Vous avez de l’expérience,
alors on vous offre
la part d’Hernandez.
- Si je le bute ?
- Oui.
Faites-le en silence, et vite.
- Je peux entrer ?
- Et bien...
J’vais pas vous faire
de mal, Monsieur. Assis.
J’suis pas comme
Hernandez ou Jarra.
Ce sont des métèques,
des brutes de la vieille école.
Moi, j’suis un homme d’affaires.
J’aime les costumes Armani,
je surfe sur le net.
Vraiment ?
J’ai une proposition
à vous faire.
Vraiment ?
Raul Hernandez doit être tué,
mais il est tellement parano
qu’il ne laisse personne l’approcher.
J’ai besoin que la personne
qu’il suspecterait le moins
l’achève,
et cette personne,
M. Rebadow, c’est vous.
Moi ? Je suis incapable
de tuer quelqu’un.
Vous l’avez déjà fait,
c’est pourquoi vous êtes ici.
Non, je ne le ferai pas.
Vous voyez, Monsieur,
y’a pas vraiment le choix.
Vous le tuez, ou je vous tue.
C’est aussi simple que ça.
Je peux me faire mettre
sous le programme de protection.
Pour le reste de votre vie ?
Vous allez vous sentir seul.
J’aimerais pas vous imaginer
en train de finir vos jours
à marmonner tout seul.
Mais si je tue Hernandez, c’est
l’isolement ou la condamnation à mort.
Non, non, non,
voilà où c’est de toute beauté.
On vous fait transférer
dans la cellule de Hernandez.
Je m’en occupe.
Et au milieu de la nuit,
vous le plantez dans le cou,
comme vous avez fait
à ce type il y a 35 ans.
Vous criez au secours et vous dites
qu’Hernandez vous attaquait.
Et que je l’ai tué
en légitime défense.
Exactement.
Un petit vieux tellement gentil,
qui va douter de votre parole ?
Alors on a un marché ?
Qu’aurai-je en échange ?
Tout ce que vous voulez.
OK, j’vais le tuer.
Je connais Raul Hernandez
depuis de nombreuses années,
et il a changé,
et pas en mieux.
Il est vraiment plus calme
ces temps-ci.
Il est à cran, dangereux.
Et vous suggérez ?
Il a besoin
d’une influence calmante,
quelqu’un comme Rebadow
par exemple.
C’est pas ma faute,
j’ai pas demandé à déménager ici.
Je sais. On n’a pas
notre mot à dire.
Vous êtes à Oz
depuis combien de temps ?
35 ans à un jour près.
C’est presque la même
chose pour moi.
Toute ma vie, à y entrer
et à en sortir,
35 ans et qu’est-ce que
ça nous rapporte ?
Rapporte ?
Ouais, on est pas supposés
tirer quelque chose
du fait qu’on est enfermés ?
Non, je crois pas.
Je veux voir Alvarez mort.
Je sais pas pourquoi.
Vous savez, c’est comme
l’un de ces réflexes qu’on a
quand on vous tape sur le genou
et que votre jambe se lève.
C’est quoi votre prénom ?
Miguel ? Don ?
- Bob.
- Oh, Bob.
Couchez-vous, Bob.
Ouais ?
- On l’a eu, M. le directeur.
- Amenez-moi ce salaud.
Oui, Monsieur.
Amenez-le.
- Bonjour, M. le directeur.
- Content de vous voir, Busmalis.
Moi aussi. Ces menottes
sont très serrées.
Va falloir supporter
la douleur un peu plus longtemps.
- On va passer à la télé, vous et moi.
- Vraiment ?
J’ai l’air comment ?
Busmalis était en train de traquer
la maison de Mlle Whitney Allen,
qui joue le rôle de Miss Sally dans
l’émission enfantine populaire
« La Cour d’École de Miss Sally ».
Avez-vous une piste
de l’autre évadé, Alvarez ?
Non, mais nous nous rapprochons.
Personne ne sera tenu
responsable d’un crime capital
ou d’un quelconque crime infâme
sauf déclaration ou accusation
par la chambre d’accusation.
Ça fait partie de l’article cinq
de la Déclaration des droits.
Les deux premiers articles sont ceux
dont on parle tout le temps,
liberté d’expression,
liberté de religion,
Le truc sur les pistolets,
mais l’article cinq, Baby,
c’est celui auquel
faut t’accrocher
quand ils te mettent
les menottes.
Aucun individu ne sera forcé
dans une affaire criminelle
à témoigner contre lui-même,
ni ne sera privé de sa vie,
sa liberté, ou sa propriété
sans que la loi ne soit appliquée
selon les procédures prévues.
Privé de sa vie.
Déjà sorti du trou ?
- Ouais.
- T’as tout raté.
Tu sais, le meurtre d’Hernandez
ne fait que nous aider.
Maintenant on peut aller
dire à Glynn
que Murphy ne peut pas
plus contrôler Amorsi que McManus,
et qu’il faut que Glynn
embauche un noir pour ce job.
On a déjà essayé
et ça n’a mené nulle part.
Plus on pousse Glynn,
plus il résiste.
Alors faut faire pression
de l’extérieur.
On fait faire pression par
des leaders de la communauté.
On ne connaît pas de leaders.
- Said en connaît.
- Non, pas Said.
Il ne va pas s’en mêler.
Aie confiance en moi, hein ?
Aie confiance.
T’as la forme.
J’ai besoin de ton aide.
Yama.
J’ai une question.
Tu es d’accord
que la vie serait meilleure
si un noir était à la tête
du quartier d’Emerald City ?
Ça dépend de quel noir il s’agit.
Disons que tu puisses
aider à le choisir.
Et pourquoi Glynn
me laisserait faire ça ?
Parce que
tu es influent.
Je sais que qui je choisirais
ne serait pas la personne
de ton choix.
Tu en es sûr ?
Oui, parce que tu cherches
à manipuler quelqu’un.
Et pas toi ?
Te moques pas de moi, Adebisi.
Je sais que tu manigances
quelque chose.
Toi et moi,
on a des façons différentes,
des raisons différentes
pour ce qu’on fait.
Ok, mais notre but
est le même...
La survie de notre peuple.
Yama.
Merci d’avoir pris le temps
de nous recevoir.
Je suis toujours ouvert
aux idées de la communauté.
Nous sommes inquiets à propos des
incidents récents de tension raciale
qui ont causé la mort
de plusieurs Afro-Américains.
Nous pensons que votre décision
de renvoyer Tim McManus
en tant que directeur d’Emerald City
ne fera que calmer la situation.
Le meurtre la nuit dernière,
le blanc qui a tué un latino...
Ça n’était pas un problème racial.
Même si c’est le cas, celui qui dirige
Emerald City temporairement
n’est pas plus qualifié
que McManus.
Ce qui nous intéresse, c’est
qui vous pensez nommer de façon
permanente à la place de McManus.
Je suis en train d’évaluer
plusieurs candidats.
Bien entendu, nous savons
que vous choisirez le meilleur.
Nous vous demandons,
si possible,
de choisir
une personne de couleur.
Beaucoup d’erreurs ont été commises
à cause du manque d’expérience
de McManus avec les hommes
des quartiers déshérités.
Je vois.
Vous voulez vous présenter
comme gouverneur adjoint de Devlin ?
Nous serions prêts
à vous apporter notre soutien
si nous savions que vous aviez
de la compassion pour nos soucis.
A vrai dire,
je pense engager
un homme noir pour ce poste,
peut-être une femme noire.
C’est une excellente nouvelle.
Je ne promets rien.
Bien entendu. La personne
la plus qualifiée.
Absolument.
Absolument.
Mobay ?
Mobay !
- Eh.
- Ouais ?
T’as déplacé mon fauteuil ?
Combien de fois faut que
j’te dise de pas le déplacer ?
Je suis allé pisser cette nuit.
Rien à foutre
que tu pisses.
Écoute, y’en a qui
m’emmerdent toute la journée.
A sauter à l’arrière
de mon fauteuil.
- Pas besoin que tu me fasses chier.
- OK, OK.
Désolé d’avoir déplacé
ton fauteuil.
J’ai fini de taper votre discours pour
l’Association des Hommes d’Affaires.
Ah oui ?
Qu’en avez-vous pensé ?
Diminuez-le de moitié.
J’ai été convoqué.
- Convoqué ?
- Par Adebisi, Pancamo et Morales.
Ils avaient demandé que je leur donne
le nom d’un dealer jamaïquain
qui pourrait les renseigner sur moi.
Je leur ai donné Nester Parks.
On l’a épinglé il y a quatre ans,
il est éligible pour la conditionnelle.
Il sait qui sera en sa faveur
au comité d’évaluation
- s’il dit ce qu’il faut.
- Je suppose que c’est ce qu’il a fait.
Ouais.
Je doute que ce soit
mon dernier obstacle.
Notre petit trio va sans doute
vouloir partager de l’héroïne avec moi.
En tant qu’officier de la loi,
vous n’avez pas le droit
de consommer.
Nous avons des moyens
de faire semblant.
Les criminels sont tellement défoncés
qu’ils s’en rendent même pas compte.
Même si c’est le cas,
à partir de maintenant
ça va devenir
bien plus dangereux.
- Vous vous inquiétez pour moi ?
- Non.
Je veux juste pas avoir à former
un autre nouvel assistant.
- De moitié, hein ?
- Au moins.
Il est où ?
Il arrive.
J’aime pas les Jamaïquains.
T’aimes personne.
Pour l’instant, t’es cool.
Mais t’as encore quelques
étapes à passer
avant de gagner notre amitié.
Tu pourrais être un enculé
d’agent secret,
mais les agents secrets n’ont pas
le droit de prendre de drogue.
Et on sait que t’achètes
beaucoup de came...
mais personne
ne t’a jamais vu l’utiliser.
A ta santé.
On veut la voir monter
dans tes narines.
Encore.
Encore.
Encore.
Qu’est-ce qui se passe,
mon pote ? Ça va ?
Mobay !
Eh, Mobay ?
Mobay ?
Mobay ?
T’as un sérieux problème,
mon pote.
Écoute, je sais où t’en es.
T’es sous un gros
tas de merde.
Faut qu’on te trouve de l’aide.
Fouille !
Fouille !
Tout le monde
devant vos cellules.
Toi, aboule !
Le droit pour chacun
que sa personne, sa maison,
ses documents et effets
personnels soient protégés
contre des recherches et saisies
ne sera pas violé.
Et aucun mandat ne sera délivré sans
une bonne raison de perquisitionner,
appuyée par un serment
ou une affirmation,
et une description particulière
de l’endroit devant être fouillé
et des personnes
ou objets devant être saisis.
C’est quoi ça, Hill ?
Je sais pas.
On dirait de la drogue.
- C’est à moi.
- Sans rire ?
Au trou.
Laissez-nous.
Eh, ça va ?
Contretemps passager.
Ça va aller.
C’est vrai ce qu’on dit ?
Tu vas défendre cet homme ?
Oui.
Je l’interdis.
- Tu l’interdis ?
- Tu as juré ne pas me défier.
En tant que leader, Arif.
J’ai pas dit que je soumettrais
mes actes à ton bon vouloir.
Affaire Harley
contre l’administration.
La condamnation à perpétuité
d’un homme noir a été annulée
lorsque l’on a découvert que le juge
qui présidait au procès
était membre actif
du Ku Klux Klan.
A cause des remarques
homophobes d’un des jurés
à mon procès,
on pourrait me libérer ?
Disons qu’au mieux tu peux espérer
avoir un nouveau procès.
Excusez-moi, Said ?
Je viens d’entendre
la nouvelle à la télé.
Notre procès, on a gagné.
Quoi ?
Le jury a décidé que l’administration
était responsable des morts
- et blessures causées par l’émeute.
- Combien on va toucher ?
On saura pas
avant la semaine prochaine,
mais le journaliste a dit
que ça pourrait être 45 millions.
Oh, putain, oui.
Chouette.
- Super nouvelle, hein ?
- C’est très bien.
Maintenant si vous voulez bien
m’excuser. On travaille avec Jason.
Ouais, OK.
Où en étais-je ?
Oui, Harley contre l’administration.
- Je croyais que tu serais content.
- Je le suis.
Kareem, Arnie Zellman dit que
nous pourrions avoir jusqu’à
$250 000 chacun en compensation.
J’ai décidé de prendre l’argent
et de recommencer à zéro.
C’est génial.
Je déteste mon travail.
Je déteste mon appartement.
Je déteste tout
de ma vie en ville.
Je vais déménager
en Californie.
En Californie ?
La seule chose
qui va me manquer ici, c’est toi.
Et même ça, mes visites ici
me semblent une erreur,
parce que je sais que
nous ne pourrons jamais être intimes
comme je sais dans mon cœur
que nous devrions l’être.
Je t’aime, Kareem.
Et je sais que tu m’aimes.
Et je sais pourquoi
tu ne peux pas le dire,
mais je t’en prie...
juste pour une fois,
dis-le, s’il te plait.
Dis-moi
que tu m’aimes.
Non.
Ça rendra ton départ
plus facile...
pour tous les deux.
- Bonjour, Révérend.
- M. Fortunato.
- Mon client, Jason Kramer.
- Eh.
Comment allez-vous ?
Félicitations pour le ce procès
contre l’administration.
Merci.
Levez-vous
pour le juge Mason Kossler.
Asseyez-vous.
J’ai lu la motion
déposée par le plaignant.
Je suis prêt
à entendre les arguments.
Votre Honneur,
Jason Kramer
est homosexuel,
mais cela n’était pas
l’objet de son procès.
Il passait en jugement
pour assassinat,
enlèvement, et agression
avec un instrument dangereux.
Un juré, un certain
M. Christopher Jacobs,
pendant les délibérations du jury,
a continuellement fait des déclarations
diffamatoires aux autres
concernant les tendances
sexuelles de M. Kramer.
Je n’ai pas parlé que de ça.
J’ai fait quelques déclarations.
Chacun des membres du jury
était d’accord avec moi.
Et l’une de ces simples
déclarations était-elle
« Ceci ne devrait pas
prendre longtemps »,
que c’était une pédale, et que
toutes les pédales devraient mourir ?
Je ne sais pas
si j’ai utilisé ces termes.
Avant d’avoir entendu
aucune autre preuve,
aucun autre témoin,
comment alliez-vous voter ?
Coupable.
- M. Kramer.
- Oui, votre Honneur ?
Vos avocats n’auraient jamais dû
permettre que Christopher Jacobs
prenne place
dans le banc des jurés.
C’était leur responsabilité.
Normalement, je le mettrais
sur le compte de la malchance
et j’en resterais là,
mais il y avait un juge
présidant votre procès
et il n’aurait jamais dû
autoriser Jacobs à servir.
Et pour cette raison,
et pour cette raison seule,
je vais accorder votre motion
pour un nouveau procès.
- Ouais !
- Votre Honneur, votre Honneur ?
Vous pourrez pleurnicher
sur le chemin du retour, Maître.
Merci.
Dans toute poursuite criminelle,
l’accusé aura droit
à un procès public
dans les plus brefs délais,
par un jury impartial.
Il sera confronté
aux témoins contre lui...
et il aura l’assistance
d’un avocat pour sa défense.
J’ai étouffé Antonio Nappa.
- Le chef de la mafia ?
- Lui-même.
- Fallait avoir les couilles.
- Pas vraiment.
Je l’ai tué sur les ordres
de M. Chucky Pancamo.
Pancamo voulait
prendre sa place ?
J’ai pas les détails,
j’ai juste fait le boulot.
Extinction des feux.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Débarrassons-nous de ça.
Zeke Bellinger, ex-mari de Shirley
Bellinger, prisonnière condamnée,
a demandé
qu’après l’exécution,
l’administration
lui remette son corps
pour l’enterrer aux côtés
de leur défunte fille.
D’après la rumeur,
Shirley Bellinger
voulait être enterrée
dans une tombe sans nom.
Pourquoi va-t-il
contre sa volonté ?
Il paraît qu’il a trouvé
la foi après la noyade.
Bonjour, Shirley.
Zeke, tu as l’air
très mince.
Ta nouvelle femme
ne te donne pas à manger ?
Patsy est chanteuse,
elle a pas le temps de cuisiner.
- Une chanteuse ?
- Oui.
Ouah, t’as de la chance.
Elle est enceinte ?
On a décidé
de ne pas avoir d’enfants.
Elle a peur pour sa ligne ?
Ça pourrait ruiner sa carrière ?
Non, je ne pourrais pas supporter
de perdre un autre enfant.
Je veux être enterrée
dans une tombe sans nom.
- Non, c’est pas bien.
- Durant nos années de mariage,
tu n’as jamais rien fait de
ce que je voulais. Fais ça.
- Non.
- Je veux être perdue dans l’oubli.
C’est trop tard.
Tu es tristement célèbre.
Je ne comprends pas.
Je n’aurais pas pensé que tu veuilles
qu’on m’enterre près de Katie.
Et bien tu vois, tu avais tort,
parce que je te pardonne.
Tu me pardonnes ?
Il m’a fallu du temps pour mettre
mon cœur à la bonne place,
mais le révérend Nahi m’a beaucoup
aidé en priant avec moi.
Dieu soit loué !
- Tu me pardonnes ?
- Oui.
Qu’est-ce qui te fait penser
que je veux ton putain de pardon ?
- Allons, Shirley, ne jure pas.
- Tu viens ici avec tes grands airs
et tu décides de me libérer
de ma culpabilité ?
Et bien, Zeke,
je ne me sens pas coupable.
J’ai fait ce que j’avais à faire,
et contrairement à toi,
au moins j’avais
assez de couilles pour ça.
Tu es venu me consoler ?
Et bien j’ai un petit lot
de consolation pour toi.
Toi et la chanteuse,
vous devriez
avoir un autre enfant
parce que quand Katie est morte,
tu n’as pas perdu d’enfant.
Elle était pas de toi.
- Quoi ?
- Ton père m’a violée.
Cet enfant était de sa graine.
Salope.
J’vais mettre ça
sous mon oreiller ce soir
et je vais attendre
que la petite souris passe.
J’en ai besoin d’ici vendredi.
Je suis sérieux.
Bien.
Merci.
Et l’argent.
Tu sais, Nikolai, je pensais
que puisqu’on a fait la paix
et que maintenant
on est copains,
tu ne me ferais pas payer
pour utiliser le portable.
Juste parce qu’on
ne s’entre-tue pas
ne veut pas dire que
tu dois profiter de moi.
Toi et moi, on est les seuls
à savoir que ce téléphone existe.
Je pourrais en parler à des gens
et ils pourraient te le prendre.
Si les garde-chiourmes
confisquent mon téléphone,
tu ne pourras pas t’en servir.
Je parlais pas
des garde-chiourmes.
Je suis très occupé.
Alors quoi que vous vouliez,
dépêchez-vous
et que ça en vaille la peine.
- Ralph Galino.
- Quoi, Ralph Galino ?
Je sais pas. C’est pas bizarre
qu’il soit mort ?
Bizarre ?
Pourquoi bizarre ?
Parce qu’à l’extérieur,
il ne s’était jamais camé.
Beaucoup de types clean
deviennent accro à Oz.
Ouais, mais pas Galino.
On est devenus copains lui et moi.
Il a été ici, quoi ?
Une semaine ?
Et il passe de rien
à une overdose ?
J’suis pas doué en morse.
Dites-moi ce que vous avez à me dire.
J’ai rien à dire.
Je sais pas pourquoi quelqu’un
voudrait faire du mal à Galino,
mais je sais qu’il avait
des prises de becs avec Stanislofsky.
Prises de becs à quel sujet ?
Faut demander
à Stanislofsky.
Foutez le camp
de mon bureau.
Allez.
Vous êtes ici parce que vous vous
inquiétez pour Ryan O’Reily.
L’autre jour, je l’ai vu
défaire son pansement
et cogner sa main à plusieurs
reprises contre le lavabo,
et faire exprès
de la faire saigner.
Vraiment ?
Je m’inquiète pour lui. Il se détruit,
il est peut-être même suicidaire.
Vous devriez l’examiner, le mettre
en isolement, tout seul.
Je dois vous dire, Nikolai, que j’ai
quelques doutes sur votre motivation.
D’après mon expérience,
quand un prisonnier
montre une inquiétude pour un autre
prisonnier, il a une idée en tête.
Vous pouvez répéter ?
Ce type Stanislofsky a raconté
des conneries sur toi.
- Stan qui ?
- Le Russe.
Et alors ?
C’est un moins que rien.
Ces mafiosos russes,
ils sont malins, Adebisi.
Ils sont malins et sans pitié.
Il m’a demandé si je pouvais l’aider
à faire quelque chose contre toi.
Ouais ?
Qu’il essaie donc.
Je te préviens,
c’est tout.
Va-t’en, O’Reily.
Pas de problème.
J’adore quand il parle
comme ça.
- Qu’est-ce qui se passe ?
- O’Reily sait qu’on a tué Galino.
- Il a juré de le venger.
- O’Reily et Galino, ça n’a pas de sens.
Ils ne faisaient pas affaires ensemble
et ils ne baisaient pas.
Alors pourquoi O’Reily aurait
quelque chose à foutre de Galino ?
Je te dis
ce que j’ai entendu.
On devrait s’occuper d’O’Reily
avant qu’il vienne à nous.
Si on le bute maintenant, on va se
retrouver coincés dans nos cellules.
Pas question.
On attend.
- Hoyt, écoute-moi.
- Quoi ? Tu comprends plus l’anglais ?
On attend.
Ouais, ouais, ouais.
Non, demain c’est bien.
OK. Merci.
Salut.
Voilà, mon pote.
- Quand tu veux, mon ami.
- Ouais.
Cyril, arrête de t’amuser.
Je m’amuse pas.
Alors lave-toi derrière les oreilles.
Personne ne voit
derrière mes oreilles.
Écoute, Cyril, c’est aujourd’hui
qu’on rencontre
le Dr Nathan et les parents
de son mari, OK ?
- Je sais.
- Allez.
Faut que tu prennes
ça au sérieux.
- C’est ce que je fais.
- Alors lave tes oreilles.
- OK.
- A plus.
Gloria, vous avez l’air anxieuse.
Non, ça va.
Moi, je le suis.
Je sais, on se prépare
depuis des semaines,
et la sœur Peter Marie pense
que nous sommes prêts,
mais je ne suis pas sûr de ce
que sera ma première réaction.
J’ai peur de vouloir
les tabasser.
Lars, ils ont la moitié
de ton âge.
Ce sont eux
qui vont te tabasser.
Même si c’est le cas...
On peut toujours annuler,
vous savez ?
Non. On a fait tout ce chemin.
Finissons-en.
Je ne comprends toujours pas que
vous puissiez encore travailler ici.
- Comment va votre main ?
- Oh, ça va.
- Vous n’avez pas dû aller à l’hôpital ?
- C’était rien.
- La blessure s’était rouverte.
- Il paraît que vous l’avez rouverte.
Vraiment ? Vous avez
entendu ça où ?
Certaines personnes
s’auto mutilent, mais pas vous.
Je sais pourquoi
vous avez fait ça.
Je sais aussi
pourquoi vous participez
à ce dialogue avec les Nathans.
Je suis ici pour débarrasser Cyril
de ses cauchemars, c’est tout.
Écoutez, Ryan,
je vous l’ai déjà dit,
je ne vous emmène pas
là-dedans
si c’est pour faire plus de mal
à Gloria et aux parents de Preston,
parce qu’en déclarant
votre amour pour Gloria,
vous ferez encore du mal.
Je sais.
Je vous ai promis, non ?
OK.
Lars et Patricia Nathan,
voici Ryan et Cyril O’Reily.
- Je suis désolé.
- Non, non, non, c’est moi.
Un enfant meurt de maladie,
à la guerre,
il se fait écraser
par un bus de ville,
vous pouvez arriver à vous convaincre
que sa mort a un sens.
Mais ça...
C’était tout prémédité,
tellement cruel.
J’étais derrière lui...
alors je pouvais pas
voir ses yeux.
Si j’avais vu ses yeux...
je sais pas
si j’aurais pu continuer.
J’arrête pas
de penser à l’avenir.
Gloria et Preston étaient
presque prêts à avoir des enfants...
mes petits enfants.
Je vous déteste pour
m’en avoir privée !
Blâmez-nous tant que vous voulez
pour ne pas avoir de petits enfants,
mais en vérité,
vous vous faites des illusions.
- La ferme.
- Non, laissez-le finir.
Le mariage entre
Gloria et votre fils,
c’était fini.
- C’est vrai ?
- Non.
- Menteuse.
- Ryan.
Nous avions
des problèmes.
- Elle a eu une liaison avec McManus.
- Bon, ça suffit.
Vous parlez encore une fois
sans mon autorisation, j’arrête tout.
- Vous avez eu une aventure ?
- Preston et moi avons été séparés.
- Il ne nous l’a jamais dit.
- Nous ne voulions pas d’intrusion.
Intrusion ?
C’était notre fils !
Et à cause de vous,
il est six pieds sous terre !
- Patricia.
- Mais c’est vrai, non ?
A cause de ce qui s’est passé
entre elle et lui,
Preston est mort !
C’est ce que tu voulais,
n’est-ce pas ?
Que nous nous disputions.
- Non.
- Si.
Tu as toujours un plan, O’Reily,
une idée secrète derrière la tête.
Pas cette fois !
Contrairement à toi,
je n’en ai pas fait un secret !
- Je t’aime !
- Arrêtez !
Je t’aimerai toujours,
et ça ne changera jamais !
- Gardes !
- Non, laissez-le le dire !
Laissez-le essayer
de se convaincre.
Tout ce que tu as fait
tout au long de ta vie, O’Reily,
tu l’as seulement fait
pour toi-même.
Tu ne sais pas aimer.
Je m’en vais.
Je vous appelle plus tard.
Une fois qu’une chose tourne mal,
elle peut jamais devenir bonne.
Ouais. Ouais.
Faut que ça soit fait
d’ici ce soir.
Ouais, je suis sérieux.
OK. Bien.
- Tu parlais à qui ?
- Personne.
Allons regarder « Miss Sally ».
- Tu te fous de moi.
- Non, Timmy Kirk me l’a dit ce matin.
Eh, c’est qui
ce métèque de Morales ?
O’Reily, t’as entendu la nouvelle ?
- Non, quoi ?
- Le docteur Nathan.
En rentrant du travail hier soir,
elle s’est fait violer.
- Violer ?
- Ouais.
Article huit. Une caution excessive
ne sera pas demandée,
ni des amendes excessives,
ni des punitions cruelles
et inhabituelles.
Cruelles et inhabituelles.
A Oz, la cruauté,
c’est la punition habituelle.
Ma sœur, ce qui est
arrivé à Gloria,
c’est dégueulasse.
Ouais, c’est terrible.
Avant de commencer,
vous avez des nouvelles de Chris ?
Non.
Il paraît qu’il va revenir
à Oz aujourd’hui.
Par contre, il va passer
du temps à l’infirmerie.
Qui t’a dit ça ?
Ma sœur.
Elle est médecin
à Benchley Memorial.
Ta sœur est médecin ?
Ouais.
En quoi, en vaudou ?
Eh, on peut commencer,
je vous prie ?
Poet, puisque vous êtes d’humeur
bavarde, commencez donc !
OK. J’ai écrit un poème.
« N’aie pas peur que l’amour sorte
ses crochets de son fourreau
et te capture dans son emprise
douloureusement séductrice.
N’aie pas peur du sang
qui coule de tes blessures
et met ta patience à l’épreuve.
N’aie pas peur des bruits
déchirants de la passion
alors qu’ils écartent
leurs sensations originelles.
N’aie pas peur
du faible battement de cœur,
car ça, ça c’est
ce qu’il y a de meilleur ».
- Bonjour, mon Père.
- Vous avez demandé à me voir ?
Vous savez
qu’on m’a tiré dessus.
Vous savez que je suis mort ?
Pendant l’opération.
Ils m’ont ramené
à la vie deux fois.
Quand on se retrouve nez à nez
avec la mort comme ça,
on commence à voir
les choses différemment.
Vous êtes en train de me dire
que vous avez changé ?
La sœur Peter Marie va bien ?
Oui.
Je veux pas dire physiquement,
je veux dire là.
J’ai joué avec ses sentiments.
J’aime le sexe, pas vous ?
J’parie que vous êtes
une nana sauvage.
Je voulais qu’elle m’aide
avec Beecher.
Maintenant il paraît
qu’elle pense quitter le couvent
et je veux faire quelque chose
pour elle en compensation.
Chris, même vous seriez d’accord
que votre crédibilité est très faible.
Écoutez,
il n’y a pas...
Il n’y a aucune raison pour que
vous ou elle me croyiez.
Mais je dois essayer.
Je dois essayer
de lui montrer que je sais
que ce que j’ai fait était mal.
Je ne veux pas brûler en enfer.
Et que voulez-vous
que je fasse ?
Demandez-lui
de venir me voir.
- Pete ?
- Bonjour.
Je viens de rendre visite
à Chris Keller.
Comment va-t-il ?
Il a retrouvé ses forces.
Il dit qu’il veut vous parler.
Et bien, je ne veux pas
lui parler.
Tobias, vous devriez partir.
Non. Nous avons du travail.
Restez où vous êtes.
Il semble plein de remords.
Difficile de savoir si c’est sincère,
- mais si c’est vrai...
- Ça n’est pas vrai.
Chris Keller est un inadapté social
menteur et manipulateur.
Je n’irai pas le voir.
Et s’il a vraiment besoin de vous
psychologiquement, spirituellement ?
Tant pis.
- Laissez-moi y aller.
- Tobias, non.
Écoutez, je sais mieux que vous...
combien il peut faire du mal,
mais malgré tout...
je l’aime.
Apportez ça
au Dr Prestopnik.
Non.
Beecher, qu’est-ce que
vous faites ici ?
J’suis venu apporter un dossier
au Dr Prestopnik.
- Il est où le dossier ?
- Sur son bureau.
Si vous l’avez livré,
barrez-vous.
- Ouais, je...
- J’en ai rien à foutre.
Barrez-vous.
A bientôt.
Quel moment émouvant,
j’vais en parler
dans mon journal intime.
Tu vas où comme ça ?
J’ai des informations.
M. Schillinger,
j’suis enfant de chœur pour
le Père Mukada à la messe.
Quand je suis au bureau en train de me
changer, parfois j’entend des choses.
- C’est de l’inédit.
- Sur quoi ?
Sur vous.
Que veux-tu en échange ?
Un type dans mon quartier,
Stan Buttwin, il m’a volé ma montre.
D’accord.
Qu’est-ce que t’as ?
Votre fils, Hank,
je sais qui a payé
pour qu’on le trouve
et s’est arrangé
pour qu’il vous voie.
Qui ?
Beecher ?
N’oubliez pas ma montre,
d’accord ?
Ça n’a pas de sens.
Pourquoi Beecher paierait
pour retrouver ton fils ?
Il a un plan,
une manigance pour m’emmerder.
Il allait utiliser Hank contre moi,
comme il l’a fait avec Andrew.
Qu’est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Prendre l’offensive.
Je sais que je vous ai élevés
à la dure, toi et ton frère,
mais faut que tu comprennes,
quand ta mère est morte,
j’ai dû vous élever tout seul.
Je vous déposais à l’école...
La même où j’étais allé,
seulement c’était
devenu un taudis.
Des nègres et des gangs,
de la drogue.
Si j’étais dur, c’était seulement
pour vous protéger.
Ouais, je sais, Papa.
- Vraiment ?
- Ouais.
J’suis pas comme Andrew,
à te blâmer pour toute
la merde dans sa vie.
Je sais que t’as fait
ce que t’as pu.
Merci, fiston.
T’es devenu tellement câlin.
Je veux que tu fasses
quelque chose pour moi.
- Faire quoi ?
- Une mission.
D’accord.
Oui.
- Combien ?
- Combien quoi ?
- Combien de fric ?
- Du fric ?
Tu veux un coup de main,
faut payer la note.
$1000.
Je suis toute ouïe, Papa.
Voilà ce qu’il faut
que tu fasses.
- Beecher ?
- Ouais ?
- Viens avec moi.
- Où ?
- Dans le bureau du directeur Glynn.
- Pourquoi il veut me voir ?
Il m’a dit de venir te chercher,
alors bouge ton cul.
Oh, putain.
Putain,
qu’est-ce qui va pas ?
Asseyez-vous.
Tobias, il n’y a pas de moyen
facile de vous dire ça.
Alors dites-le.
Votre fils et votre fille
ont été enlevés.
Non, non.
La Déclaration d’indépendance stipule
qu’on nous doit, à nous tous,
certains droits, le plus important
étant celui à la vie,
la liberté et la recherche
du bonheur.
J’veux dire, c’est pas
tout ce qui compte ?
La vie, la liberté...
le bonheur.
La pitié est la compassion
ressentie pour les malheurs d’autrui.
La pitié nous pousse
à alléger ces malheurs.
La pitié est enfant de la charité,
mais sœur de la justice
car elles sont toutes deux
ce lien invisible
qui existe entre les gens.
La pitié est spontanée parce que
le malheur est involontaire.
Vers 15h15,
alors que vos enfants rentraient
de l’école avec quatre camarades,
une camionnette bleue
s’est arrêtée près d’eux.
Un homme blanc en est sorti.
Il s’est approché de Gary et Holly
en disant que vous, Mme Beecher,
lui aviez demandé
d’aller les chercher.
Gary a d’abord hésité,
mais à la longue,
l’homme l’a persuadé
à l’aide de cartes
de Pokémon.
Ensuite, la camionnette
a filé vers l’est de la ville.
Que fait-on pour les retrouver ?
Un kidnapping est
un jeu d’attente, ma sœur.
Il faut attendre
qu’on nous contacte.
- Et si on vous contacte pas ?
- Annonces de recherche.
- Toby.
- C’est sûrement Schillinger.
- On a aucune preuve.
- Bon Dieu de merde, qui d’autre ?
Vous êtes d’une famille riche.
Ils demanderont probablement
une rançon.
Vous foutez tout en l’air,
connard.
Trouvez mes foutus gosses !
- Oh mon Dieu !
- Trouvez mes foutus gosses !
Sortez-le ! Dehors !
Trouvez mes gosses !
Je ne suis pas au courant
d’un kidnapping.
Beecher pense que oui,
que vous êtes derrière tout ça.
Il s’est passé plein
de conneries entre nous,
alors je comprends
qu’il dise ça.
Mais Beecher et moi,
on a aussi un truc en commun.
On est tous les deux pères.
J’ai perdu un fils.
Je sais par quoi il passe.
Désolé pour ce qui s’est passé
à la bibliothèque.
J’étais tellement frustré.
Je sais. Je sais.
Vous devriez appelez votre mère.
Elle est bouleversée.
On en a parlé
dans la voiture.
Toby, tu es ici parce que le...
Ton alcoolisme et le fait d’avoir
frappé la petite Brockwell,
ta mère et moi, on peut pas
s’empêcher de penser
que c’est en partie
de notre faute.
- Non, Papa.
- On a négligé ton éducation.
Écoute, même si j’ai envie
de te blâmer
pour ce trou de merde
qu’est devenue ma vie,
mon malaise est en moi.
Il m’appartient,
et je dois le maîtriser
sinon il me dominera.
Pour l’instant, je veux juste
avoir mes enfants.
Alors, nos petits chéris
sont sains et saufs ?
- Ouais.
- Très bien.
On passe à la vitesse supérieure.
Tu vas envoyer le paquet.
Papa, t’es sûr ?
- Oui.
- Ben, j’pensais...
enfin, ça me gêne pas
d’enfreindre la loi.
Ça va pour voler
quelques bagnoles.
Mais ce kidnapping...
Baisse la voix.
Ce genre de choses,
c’est pas mon style.
Je te payerai le double.
D’accord.
- Vous êtes Les Hibitz ?
- Ouais.
Tobias Beecher.
Je peux m’asseoir avec vous ?
- A côté de moi ?
- Ouais.
Personne ne s’assied
jamais à côté de moi.
Vous avez fait de la prison
pour kidnapping, correct ?
- Ouais, c’étais un coup monté.
- Ouais, sûrement.
Je sais pas si vous
êtes au courant,
mais mes deux enfants ont
été enlevés récemment.
- Je n’y suis pour rien.
- Je sais.
Je voulais savoir si...
Je me demandais si
vous pouviez vous renseigner.
Voir si on a engagé
quelqu’un pour ça.
Je vais voir si je trouve
une piste,
mais j’ai pas trop d’espoir.
Dis, tu aimes Def Leppard ?
Il y a bien longtemps,
L’Eglise Catholique fit une liste
de toutes les actions de charité.
Nourrir les affamés,
abreuver les assoiffés,
vêtir les dénudés,
toute cette merde.
Rançonner les captifs
en faisait partie.
A cette époque, les pirates
et les infidèles
enlevaient les jeunes filles
et les pèlerins chrétiens.
Les croyants devaient
payer pour les revoir.
Qui rançonne les captifs
de nos jours ?
On compte plutôt sur nous
pour visiter les prisonniers.
C’est ça.
Passez nous voir.
Ça suffit, vous deux.
- Ça va bien ?
- Oh ouais, putain.
Hé, on me poignarde,
on me tire dessus,
mais je crève pas.
Comment ça va ?
- Mes gosses...
- Je sais.
C’est dégueulasse.
J’suis désolé.
Putain, je me sens
si impuissant.
C’est sûr.
Au moins le bébé,
Harry, va bien.
Toby, ils vont s’en sortir,
tu m’entends ?
Ils vont s’en sortir.
Tout ira bien.
Oh, putain.
Tu m’as manqué.
Toi aussi.
Keller est de retour
à Emerald City.
Les deux amoureux
sont réunis.
J’espère qu’ils passeront
une bonne soirée.
Ce sera leur dernière nuit
de sommeil...
ou de paix.
Beecher va en prendre pour
un bon bout de temps.
Chris ?
Pardon, je t’ai réveillé ?
Salut.
Qu’est-ce qu’il y a ?
Toby, je suis mort...
et il n’y a pas
de lumière blanche.
J’y étais, mais
on m’a fait revenir.
Mais j’y étais, Toby.
J’étais en enfer et j’ai tout senti.
J’ai senti la douleur
et le feu de l’éternité.
Hé. Allez.
Ça va aller.
Non, ça va pas aller.
Arrête de me mentir, bordel.
J’y étais, Toby.
Ils m’ont fait revenir.
Tu sais ce qui est drôle ?
T’étais furax quand je parlais
de Dieu avec Said,
mais je lui parlais
justement de ça.
Si Oz est tout ce qui
nous reste dans cette vie,
on a intérêt
à penser au reste,
ce qui vient après.
Me lâche pas.
D’accord, d’accord.
Tobias.
Je m’attendais pas à vous voir
avec tout ce qui se passe.
Le travail empêche
mon esprit de s’effondrer.
Oui, c’est vrai.
C’est de la folie dehors,
pourtant il n’y a pas
une grande foule.
Hélas, les gens s’habituent
à la peine capitale.
Sœur Peter,
j’ai besoin d’un service.
Je ferai mon possible.
C’est quoi ?
Parlez à Chris.
Vous me demandez la seule chose
que je ne ferai pas.
Il se sent très mal.
Il a voulu m’utiliser
pour arriver à vous.
Et là, il vous utilise
pour pouvoir m’approcher.
Je ne jouerai pas son jeu.
Il pense que si vous
quittez le couvent,
il va brûler pour l’éternité.
Il va brûler, c’est sûr,
mais pas pour ça.
Il brûlera pour tous ceux
à qui il a fait du mal,
toutes ces autres vies détruites,
y compris la tienne.
On a examiné les dossiers de plusieurs
prisonniers d’Emerald City.
L’un deux pourrait avoir
un rapport avec le kidnapping.
- Qui ?
- Christopher Keller.
Non.
Chris est mon ami.
Montrez-moi ça.
Keller vous a brisé tous
les os du corps.
- Ce serait lui ?
- Il m’a sauvé de Schillinger.
Je vous dis que le responsable
est Schillinger.
Vol à main armée,
agression, kidnapping.
- On l’a pas reconnu coupable.
- On le soupçonne d’avoir violé,
torturé et tué
plusieurs homosexuels ?
C’est pas possible.
C’est pas lui.
T’en es sûr ?
Je connais Chris, maman...
de façon intime.
De façon intime ?
C’est mon amant.
Putain de merde.
Vern, faut que tu vois ça.
Qu’est-ce que t’as ?
Un paquet pour
Tobias Beecher. Regarde.
Nom de Dieu !
Agent Howell ?
On a un problème.
C’est quoi ce putain de truc ?
Une main d’enfant.
Laissez-nous seuls.
Vous tenez le coup ?
Quelques jours au trou
me rendent plus crédible auprès
de Pancamo, Adebisi et Morales.
Vous avez déjà passé
du temps là-dedans ?
Non.
Bien.
T’as pas bonne mine.
- Alors je suis in ?
- « Alors je suis in. »
Adebisi est pas convaincu, mec.
Faut que tu passes
un autre test.
Eh ouais.
On va boxer ?
On veut voir si
tu peux prendre un coup...
ou deux.
T’as un problème
avec moi, mec ?
Ouais, t’es faible.
Donne-moi les gants.
En fait, on va pas se battre.
- Non ?
- Non.
Tu vas me servir
de punching-ball.
On va parier pour voir
combien de temps tu tiendras.
Prêt ?
- Ouais.
- Ding, ding.
Et voilà.
15 secondes.
J’ai gagné.
Passez la monnaie.
Hé, super impressionnant.
Ouais, merci.
- Tu dois avoir mal.
- Ouais, ouais.
J’t’ai apporté un petit truc
pour calmer tes blessures.
Plus tard.
Qu’est-ce que tu fous ?
Le petit-déjeuner
des champions.
Vous vouliez me voir ?
On vient de faire
un sondage d’opinion sur toi.
J’ai voté oui.
- J’ai voté non.
- Je me suis abstenu.
- Match nul.
- On peut changer ça ?
Il y a un test final.
Et c’est... ?
Tu dois tuer quelqu’un.
- Qui ?
- N’importe qui.
On s’en fout.
C’est bon.
Je le ferai.
Pete, j’ai de graves nouvelles.
- Mon Dieu, quoi donc ?
- Le cardinal va venir.
Le cardinal Abgott
vient à Oz ?
Il veut dire une messe,
rencontrer le personnel
et aussi quelques prisonniers.
Vous êtes ami avec lui,
n’est-ce pas ?
On a travaillé ensemble
jusqu’à ce qu’il me transfère ici.
Je n’étais pas souvent
d’accord avec lui.
Je prends un jour de congé.
Oh, non.
Vous ne pouvez pas.
Ray, j’ai presque quitté
le couvent.
Ce serait un peu hypocrite
de frayer avec le cardinal, non ?
Mais il a précisé
qu’il voulait vous rencontrer.
Moi ? Pourquoi ?
Tout ça a commencé
parce que Son Eminence
a reçu une lettre
d’un prisonnier.
Lequel ?
Chris Keller.
Chris Keller.
Évidemment.
Raymond.
Cardinal Abgott,
merci de votre visite.
Un plaisir de vous voir,
mon fils.
Mettons-nous en tenue.
Savez-vous pourquoi
je vous ai transféré à Oswald ?
J’avais trop d’opinions ?
Votre ego était trop grand.
Probablement.
Quelque chose me dit
que ça a changé.
- Le corps du Christ.
- Amen.
- Le corps du Christ.
- Amen.
- Le corps du Christ.
- Amen.
- Le corps du Christ.
- Amen.
- Le corps du Christ.
- Amen.
J’ai parlé à la directrice
de votre ordre,
Sœur Liocarria.
Il paraît que vous doutez
de votre vocation.
Oui, c’est exact.
Bienvenue au club.
Vous aussi ?
Ma première paroisse était
en pleine campagne,
un endroit désert.
Le pasteur et la femme de ménage
plus vieux l’un que l’autre.
C’était bien solitaire
en hiver.
J’ai pleuré...
et j’ai prié.
J’ai pleuré encore...
et j’ai prié encore plus fort.
Eh bien, c’est ce que je fais.
Bien.
La décision que vous prendrez
sera la bonne.
Merci.
Dieu vous bénisse, ma Sœur.
Dieu vous bénisse, ma Sœur.
Comme vous le savez,
le jury a décidé en notre faveur.
Ils reconnaissent que
l’État était coupable
de toutes blessures et tous
décès causés après l’émeute.
Ils ont donc émis un avis
nous donnant droit à recevoir
un règlement complet.
45 millions.
Avant d’aller dépenser
cet argent, sachez que
l’État a fait appel.
- Appel ?
- Oui. C’est une année électorale.
Ça m’étonnerait que Devlin
nous fasse un chèque,
pas avant novembre.
Said, tu peux pas
faire avancer les choses ?
Comme on le sait,
le système juridique est très lent.
On peut pas savoir
quand notre cas
passera en cour d’appel.
Ça a pris 30 ans aux prisonniers
d’Attica pour gagner.
30 putains d’années ?
Merde alors.
Je serai un vieillard.
Comme toi, Rebadow.
Écoutez, je sais
que c’est frustrant,
mais avec cette décision
de la cour,
on a franchi un gros obstacle,
c’est une énorme victoire.
On doit rester résolus.
Je vous informerai
de quoi que ce soit.
Oui ?
Vous avez déjà tué quelqu’un ?
Non.
C’est une expérience extraordinaire
de voir la vie s’éteindre
des yeux de quelqu’un.
Même en train de mourir,
Hernandez avait l’instinct
de me tuer
parce que je le tuais.
Il était plus important pour lui
de se venger que de survivre.
Et ça nous mène où,
ce préambule ?
Jason Kramer. Vous lui avez
obtenu un nouveau procès.
Oui.
Je sais que les autres musulmans
vous pressent
de ne pas vous impliquer
dans cette affaire.
- Oui ?
- Vous devriez les écouter.
Et vous croyez ça
parce que...
J’ai eu la prémonition hier
que Kramer serait relâché.
Rebadow, je vais vous
dire un truc.
Je vais vous expliquer.
Jason Kramer est coupable
d’avoir assassiné son amant.
J’ai vu les copies du procès
et toutes les preuves.
Il sera reconnu coupable
de nouveau.
Pourquoi vous êtes-vous battu
pour un nouveau procès ?
Le jury a voté contre Kramer
parce qu’il était gay.
Alors tout ça pour vous,
c’est théorique.
La justice n’a rien de théorique.
Si Kramer est libéré...
Il sera pas libéré.
J’espère vraiment
que vous avez raison.
Une entrevue a été demandée
concernant votre procès.
Ah ouais ?
Entrevue avec qui ?
L’inspecteur
qui vous a arrêté.
Robert Stransky.
Voilà le deal.
Vous avez obtenu un nouveau
procès pour ce fumier, hein ?
Il me reste trois
ou quatre mois à vivre.
Avant de mourir,
je veux mettre certaines
choses au clair.
Je dois vous dire
que j’ai falsifié les preuves.
Je trouvais pas l’arme du crime,
donc j’ai filé à la cuisine.
J’ai sorti un couteau d’un tiroir,
l’ai trempé dans le sang
et l’ai laissé à côté
de son corps.
Ses empreintes sont partout
sur le couteau.
Non.
Non, elles n’y étaient pas.
Mon pote du labo médical
a faussé les tests.
Et vous seriez d’accord
pour faire une déposition ?
D’aller à la cour
et de raconter ça ?
Je sais que ce salaud
est plus que coupable,
mais je veux racheter
un morceau de mon âme.
Ouais, si vous voulez,
je le crierai du toit
de la prison.
OK, chéri ?
Si on révèle cette information,
la presse va en faire
des gorges chaudes.
Oui.
Et vous dites que le seul témoin,
le mec d’Airborn, est mort ?
Oui.
Je sais pas, mec.
Peut-être que tout ça
va s’arranger en ma faveur.
Oui. Kramer...
Je me retire du procès.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
Que moi, ton avocat,
te donne ma démission...
immédiatement.
Pour instruire l’ignorant,
conseiller l’indécis,
réprimander les pécheurs.
Pour qu’il y ait
ces actes de charité,
il faut deux choses :
quelqu’un en détresse
et quelqu’un
qui peut l’aider.
En d’autres termes,
un ignorant ne peut
instruire un autre ignorant,
et un pécheur ne peut
réprimander un autre pécheur.
Aujourd’hui durant le procès
de Jason Kramer,
précédemment reconnu coupable
du meurtre de son amant,
le jury a trouvé Kramer
non coupable.
Après deux ans de prison,
il sortira du pénitencier
d’Oswald
dans la semaine.
Pour la suite, le taux
de chômage
est tombé ce mois-ci à 3,8%.
Les premiers chiffres
transmis hier
par le Ministère du Travail
indique que les employeurs
ont crée environ 1000 postes.
Allah n’écoute pas, mon frère.
Pour toi, il est sourd.
Monsieur le directeur,
j’peux vous parler ?
Je sais que vous avez
eu des réunions
avec les membres
de la communauté locale
concernant le remplacement
de Tim McManus.
- Oui.
- Vous avez parlé
d’engager un Africain-américain
pour le poste.
- Vous m’avez mis sur écoute ?
- J’aimerais bien
venir vous voir.
Pour qu’on parle
du genre d’homme
qu’il vous faudrait.
Ce serait avec plaisir,
mais j’ai déjà engagé quelqu’un.
D’ailleurs, il va bientôt arriver.
Il s’appelle Martin Querns.
Je tiens à vous remercier
de cette occasion.
J’entends parler d’Emerald City
depuis si longtemps.
Au départ, c’était
expérimental,
mais hélas,
ça n’a pas vraiment marché.
Enfin, je sais pas.
La première étape a échoué.
Mais comme
dans toute expérience,
on doit essayer plusieurs méthodes
pour trouver la bonne.
Pour moi le plus
important c’est
d’abord d’étouffer
les tensions raciales,
et ensuite, d’étouffer
la violence en général.
Ce sont également
mes priorités.
Me donnez-vous permission
de faire le nécessaire
pour maintenir la paix ?
Oui. Je vous donne
carte blanche...
tant que vous ne foirez pas.
Eh bien, c’est tout
ce que je demande.
OK, tout le monde,
écoutez bien.
Je vous présente
Martin Querns,
le nouveau directeur de section.
Il a une grande expérience
des prisons fédérales,
ainsi que des centres
de détention de l’État.
Le directeur a raison.
J’ai travaillé
dans plusieurs institutions,
mais il ne vous a pas dit que,
comme la plupart d’entre vous,
je viens de la rue.
Je ne suis pas
un blanc-bec large d’esprit
qui veut vous transformer
en bons citoyens.
J’ai l’intention de rencontrer
chacun de vous.
Mais en attendant,
rappelez-vous d’une chose :
on déconne pas avec Querns.
C’est tout.
Je voulais vous rencontrer
en premier car il paraît
que vous êtes l’un
des chefs par ici
en ce qui concerne
le trafic de drogues.
Quand j’étais jeune,
je travaillais pour Petit Sam Colby.
Vous le connaissez ?
Petit Sam pesait
environ 150 kg.
J’ai monté les échelons
dans son organisation
jusqu’à ce que Ricky J. Lee
lui fasse sauter la cervelle.
Il était temps pour moi
de démissionner.
Où voulez-vous en venir ?
Vous dire que je connais
toutes vos astuces.
Et que je suis plus malin
que vous.
- Vous, plus malin ?
- Oh oui.
Parce que moi,
je me suis pas fais prendre.
Comment tu gardes ça
sur ta tête ?
Qu’est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Me frapper ?
Assieds-toi.
Écoute-moi bien,
Simon Adebisi.
A mes yeux,
les prisonniers drogués
sont les plus tranquilles,
alors, tu peux vendre
tout ce que tu veux
à qui tu veux.
Je m’en fous.
Je n’y ferai pas attention.
A une condition, mec.
Hé, t’es vraiment malin.
Une condition : pas de violence.
Aucune. Rien.
On est d’accord ?
- C’est tout, pas de violence ?
- Ouais.
Il m’a dit de m’assurer
que tout le monde
obéisse aux règles
tout le temps.
C’est peut-être une ruse.
- Ouais.
- Je ne crois pas.
Comme
au bon vieux temps.
Nous, Siciliens, on surveillait
nos rues, alors les flics s’écartaient.
Little Italie était l’endroit
le plus sûr de la ville.
- Écoutez, je vote oui.
- Moi aussi.
Très bien.
Merci d’avoir appelé. J’allais
justement en faire autant.
Oui, Leo...
après la fusillade
et quand Diane est partie,
j’ai pris le large.
Le fait de chanter aux funérailles
de l’agent Howard,
c’était de la folie.
Mais j’ai eu le temps de
me reposer et de réfléchir.
- Tim...
- Je suis prêt a revenir.
- Revenir ?
- Pour diriger Emerald City.
Tu ne peux pas.
Le poste n’est plus disponible.
- Quoi ?
- J’ai embauché quelqu’un.
- Eh bien, désembauchez-le.
- Non.
On m’a blâmé d’avoir fait
entrer ce revolver à Em City,
mais d’après les journaux,
c’est Clayton Hughes,
votre petit protégé,
qui l’a fait entrer.
Oui, et il a été inculpé.
Il est libéré sous caution
jusqu’à son procès.
- Je veux reprendre mon poste.
- Vous avez les oreilles bouchées ?
Mais, Leo,
c’est toute ma vie.
Je sais bien.
J’ai une autre offre.
Holt prend sa retraite. Il me faut
quelqu’un pour la section B.
J’accepte.
Tiens. Regardez qui vient
se joindre à nous.
L’arrestation de Busmalis
et la visite du cardinal
peuvent nettement
arranger la situation.
Notre dernier scrutin montre
que 42% du public
pensent que les prisons
sont bien dirigées.
Ça fait 16 points de plus
depuis la fusillade d’Em City.
L’exécution de Bellinger
va causer des répercussions ?
Un peu.
Mais la capture d’Alvarez
pourrait les compenser.
Malheureusement,
toujours pas de signe de lui.
Notre gros souci du moment
est Clayton Hughes.
Il est en liberté provisoire
et il a fait
pas mal de discours
condamnant le gouverneur.
Je sais.
Vous avez une relation
avec Hughes, n’est-ce pas ?
Son père et moi étions
tous deux des novices à Oz.
Son père est mort dans mes bras,
tué par un prisonnier en 1982.
Eh bien, ça pourrait être utile.
Tu dois lui parler à lui, Leo.
Dis-lui de se taire.
C’est le moment de faire
du charme au procureur.
Desmond...
trouvez-moi Clayton Hughes.
Je vous demande simplement
de calmer votre éloquence.
Mon éloquence ?
Je dis la vérité.
Devlin représente tout ce qu’il y a
de mauvais chez les Blancs.
J’ai du mal à comprendre
que vous pensiez
à vous présenter avec lui
comme gouverneur adjoint.
Clayton, vous avez eu
une enfance protégée.
C’est reparti.
Tout n’est pas lié
à la mort de mon père.
Bien au contraire.
Vous ne voyez le monde
qu’en noir et blanc.
Croyez-moi, la vie est grise,
comme ces putain de murs.
Bon, je n’aime pas
James Devlin,
mais je ne le vois pas
comme le diable non plus.
On doit l’arrêter
au plus vite.
L’intégrité.
C’est ce qui distingue les vrais chefs
des politiciens typiques.
Un candidat
au poste de gouverneur a...
Vous les Américains,
vous croyez que votre démocratie
vous rend meilleurs
que les autres.
Les élections, ça ne rend pas
un pays important.
Ouais ? Quoi alors ?
La vodka ?
Comment on dit ?
Être sans pitié.
- Qui est Saint Pitié ?
- Hein ?
Je ne connais pas de Saint Pitié.
Écoute, Nikolai,
j’ai réfléchi.
On pourrait se faire pas mal
de fric tous les deux
en louant le portable
à ces brutes.
- « Tous les deux ? »
- Ouais. On est associés, non ?
Non. Le téléphone
est à moi, O’Reily.
Si on l’apprend, quelqu’un finira
par lâcher le morceau aux gardes.
Alors ferme bien ta gueule.
J’aimerais bien savoir où se
trouve sa putain de cachette.
Putain.
- Comme une chasse au trésor ?
- Ouais.
Comme une putain de
chasse au trésor, Cyril.
Tu vas fouiller chaque
centimètre carré d’Em City,
pour me trouver
ce portable.
Mais personne ne doit savoir
ce que tu fais,
surtout pas Stanislofsky.
- OK ?
- OK. Je peux commencer ?
Tout de suite. Vas-y.
J’ai fait ce que tu voulais.
J’ai rien dit à personne.
C’est bien. Mais t’as pas
trouvé le portable, hein ?
- Non.
- T’as cherché partout ?
- Ouais.
- Où cache-t-il ce foutu machin ?
Salut, comment ça va ?
Je vais tuer cet enculé.
Je vais le tuer, bordel.
Oui ?
- Le Dr Nathan est là.
- Faites-la entrer.
Gloria.
Je peux vous embrasser ?
Ouais.
- Asseyez-vous, je vous prie.
- Merci.
Puis-je faire quelque chose
pour vous ?
Ouais, arrêtez
d’être si gentil.
Très bien.
C’est pas ce que je voulais dire.
Leo, vous savez bien
par quoi je passe,
votre fille aussi
s’est fait violer.
Elle va mieux maintenant.
Et vous aussi, vous irez mieux.
Je veux reprendre le travail.
Si vite ?
C’est maintenant ou jamais.
Gloria...
je ne veux pas vous voir partir,
mais il ne faut pas non plus
aller trop vite.
La guérison
doit se faire en douceur.
Pas pour moi.
Une seule chose m’aidera
à me sentir mieux.
Et quoi donc ?
Confronter Ryan O’Reily.
C’est vous qui êtes responsable.
De quoi ?
De mon viol.
- Sûrement pas !
- Ne niez pas, bordel, surtout pas.
- Gloria.
- Je sais.
Je sais.
Vous avez demandé à quelqu’un
de vous rendre un service.
Pourquoi je ferais ça ?
Parce que la session de l’autre jour
s’est pas passée comme prévu.
Parce que vous ne pouviez pas
me manipuler.
Parce que vous êtes
un sale tordu.
Vous voulez que j’avoue
qu’un de mes potes
vous a battue et violée ?
C’est ça que vous voulez ?
Oui.
Très bien. C’est vrai.
Contente ?
Oui.
La seule chose
dans tout ce merdier
que vous m’avez répété sans fin,
c’est que vous m’aimez
et vous attendiez que
je vous le dise aussi.
Eh bien, aujourd’hui
je suis venue
pour voir votre visage
quand je vous dirai
que ça n’arrivera jamais.
D’ailleurs, c’est le contraire.
Je vous hais.
Et je vous haïrai
jusqu’à ce qu’on soit
morts et enterrés.
Je vous haïrai !
Bien.
Alors dites-moi un truc.
Quand il vous baisait,
vous avez pensé à moi ?
- Gloria !
- Ça suffit !
Arrêtez ! Reculez !
Garde !
Vous avez pensé à moi ?
Vous avez pensé à moi, bordel ?
Vous avez pensé à moi ?
Allez, Gloria !
Vous pensiez à moi ?
Hein ? Hein ?
Un autre acte de charité :
réconforter les affligés.
Mais vous voyez,
il y a plusieurs façons
de réconforter quelqu’un,
et beaucoup ne veulent pas
être réconfortés.
Gloria Nathan va engager
des poursuites contre vous,
ce qui pourrait ajouter cinq ans
de plus à votre sentence.
Cinq ans. Zut alors.
Et je dois faire un rapport.
Bon.
Je vous connais bien, Ryan.
Ça va vous sembler drôle, mais j’ai bien
l’impression que vous mentez.
Vous n’avez rien à voir
avec le viol de Gloria.
Je vous ai dit que
c’est moi.
OK ?
OK.
On va revoir Dr Nathan
et tous ces gens sympa ?
On les verra plus. C’est fini.
Ils me haïssent encore ?
Non, Cyril, pas toi.
C’est moi qu’ils haïssent.
Tu sais, cet homme
que tu as tué...
- Le mari du Dr Nathan ?
- Ouais.
C’était pas de ta faute, OK ?
OK.
Et Hamid Khan,
c’était moi aussi.
D’accord ?
Faut que tu saches, Cyril.
Je suis coupable,
pas toi.
Je me souviens
quand j’étais petit,
maman nous emmenait
en confession
et on entrait dans
une grande boîte
pour dire tous nos péchés.
Et maman disait
que tout raconter à Dieu,
ça effaçait tous nos péchés.
Tu te souviens ?
Ouais.
Ouais, je me souviens.
Bénissez-moi, mon Père
car j’ai péché.
Aujourd’hui, j’ai menti.
J’ai avoué une faute que
j’ai pas commise.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que c’est ce qu’elle
voulait entendre.
Elle en a besoin pour
se remettre sur pieds.
Le fugitif Miguel Alvarez
est toujours en fuite
et la police a étendu ses recherches
à travers la région.
Alvarez et un autre prisonnier,
Agamemnon Busmalis,
se sont échappés...
Regarde qui sort du trou.
Agamemnon vient d’être capturé
et renvoyé à Oswald
en début de semaine.
- Comment ça va ?
- Qu’est-ce que tu fais ?
Y’a quelqu’un de Cleveland, ici ?
Très bien.
Être libre, même
pour quelques heures,
c’était merveilleux.
J’avais pas d’argent,
pas de manteau,
il faisait froid,
mais putain,
j’étais si heureux
que j’ai dansé
en plein milieu de la rue.
Évidemment,
c’est là qu’ils m’ont attrapé.
Tu étais devant la maison
de Miss Sally.
Ouais, j’espérais l’apercevoir
en personne,
peut-être lui dire
un ou deux mots.
- Qu’est-il arrivé à Alvarez, bordel ?
- Je sais pas.
Dès qu’on est sortis du tunnel,
il s’est barré.
Tu sais ce qui me
manque le plus ?
Prendre un bain.
Je déteste les douches.
Se plonger dans un bain chaud,
- des bulles partout.
- Des bulles.
Je parie que t’avais
un canard en caoutchouc, hein ?
Canard en caoutchouc ?
- Ouais.
- C’est quoi, ce truc ?
Un produit de l’impérialisme
capitaliste.
Qu’est-ce qui te manque
le plus, Bob ?
J’ai rien à te dire.
Bob, allez, parle-moi.
Ce silence est épuisant.
Pourquoi t’es fâché avec moi ?
Si tu ne le sais pas,
c’est encore pire.
T’es furax parce que
je me suis évadé ?
Parce que tu m’as pas
demandé de venir avec toi.
- Oh.
- Tu m’as jamais dit
que tu creusais
un autre tunnel.
- J’avais mes raisons.
- Lesquelles ?
- Eh bien...
- Quoi ?
Je croyais que tu allais
me ralentir.
- Te ralentir ?
- Désolé, Bob.
- Mais je suis en pleine forme.
- Je sais.
- J’ai tué un homme.
- Je sais.
Va te faire foutre.
Oh, merde.
Demain à l’aube,
Shirley Bellinger
sera exécutée pour avoir
noyé sa fillette de huit ans.
La loi permet à Bellinger
de choisir son exécution
et Bellinger, la première femme
à être exécutée par l’État
depuis 1841, a choisi
la pendaison.
Merde, je peux plus écouter
ces putain de conneries.
Ouais, ça me déprime, bordel.
Adebisi, t’étais pas
amoureux de Bellinger ?
Non.
Si, t’avais le béguin pour elle.
Elle avait le béguin pour moi.
Si je dois mourir,
ce serait par injection.
Moi, par overdose.
50 gr d’héroïne, d’un coup.
L’État ne va pas
te donner de la drogue.
L’injection,
c’est pas de la drogue ?
Un docteur décide où
placer le nœud coulant
selon la taille et le poids
de la personne,
pour que le nœud brise
le cou au bon endroit.
Le jour de mon exécution,
j’étais terrifié.
Mais le fait de ne pas mourir
m’a donné le sentiment
d’être un lâche.
Les manifestants contre
la peine de mort sont encore
devant la prison, bien que
les employés prétendent
qu’ils sont moins
nombreux que prévu.
Au revoir Bellinger, hein ?
Ouais. J’espérais la revoir
encore une fois,
mais les gardes n’enverront
le courrier chez les condamnés
qu’après l’exécution.
Une sacrée fille.
Me rappelle ma pauvre femme.
Mon Arlene.
Elle m’a montré sa chatte.
Je lavais le sol devant
sa cellule et paf !
Elle m’a montré sa chatte.
L’exécution de Shirley Bellinger
aura lieu demain à l’aube.
- Au revoir.
- Peter Marie...
Non, j’ai accepté
de ne pas protester en public,
mais je n’ai aucune d’envie
d’écouter ces détails sinistres.
Mais Bellinger
vous a demandé un service.
Quoi ?
Que vous preniez tout ses effets
personnels après sa mort.
Elle ne veut les donner
à personne d’autre.
Qu’est-ce que j’en ferai ?
Vous en ferez ce que
vous voulez.
OK. Ce sera tout ?
Oui.
Ray, elle aimerait
prier avec vous.
Bien.
Shirley, pensez-vous
à quelque chose
- avant de partir ?
- Si je pense ?
Je pense à plein de choses,
c’est sûr !
- Voulez-vous nous les confier ?
- Oui.
Je me demande pourquoi
tout ça vous intéresse.
Vous vous en foutiez bien
quand mon mari me battait
ou quand mon beau-père
me violait.
Mais maintenant que j’ai fait
un truc horrible
comme de tuer ma fille, là,
on veut savoir à quoi je pense.
Je voulais que quelqu’un
se rende compte,
et maintenant que c’est arrivé,
je vois que ma vie n’est
qu’une merde de toute façon.
Je peux pas dire merde à la TV ?
Je peux pas dire « merde »,
n’est-ce pas ?
Vous voulez pas savoir
qui l’a mise enceinte à Oz ?
Non.
C’est l’heure.
Bonjour, mon chou.
Comment ça va ?
Je m’suis réveillée
avec un torticolis.
J’ai dû dormir de travers.
- Ça doit être le stress.
- De toute façon,
la pendaison devrait
arranger mon torticolis.
- Qu’est-ce que j’ai raté ?
- Rien, Natalie.
- Et Miles, il dort ?
- Ouais.
Ce type a pas le sens
des convenances.
Alors, c’était quoi
ton dernier repas ?
Un Slim Fast.
Faut faire attention
à sa ligne,
même si on est un cadavre.
Prête ?
Tout à fait.
Désolée de vous faire lever
si tôt, mon Père.
Monsieur le directeur,
l’Agent Lopresti est venu
dans ma cellule chaque nuit
pour me baiser.
- Elle ment.
- On verra ça plus tard.
Bien, monsieur.
- Salope.
- Tu sais que...
- Tu peux résoudre un mystère ?
- Peut-être.
Quand tu es tombée enceinte ici,
qui était le père ?
- C’était Lopresti ?
- Oh non.
Il n’était pas encore garde
chez les condamnés.
Mon amant était Satan
déguisé en homme.
Quel homme ?
Une dame ne révèle pas
ces secrets-là.
Mais je peux donner un indice.
Ni pluie ni neige...
- Au revoir, Moïse.
- Salut, Shirley.
A plus tard, petite.
Garde-moi une place
au salon de beauté.
- « Le Seigneur est mon berger... »
- « Je ne manquerai de rien.
Il me fait reposer dans
de verts pâturages.
Il me dirige près des eaux paisibles.
Il restaure mon âme ».
« Il me conduit dans les sentiers
de la justice,
à cause de Son nom.
Quand je marche dans la vallée
de l’ombre de la mort,
je ne crains aucun mal... »
« Tu dresses devant moi une table,
en face de mes adversaires.
Tu oins d’huile ma tête.
J’habiterai dans la maison du Seigneur
jusqu’à la fin de mes jours ».
Amen.
Non, non, non.
J’ai changé d’avis.
Je ne veux pas mourir comme ça.
- Je ne veux pas mourir.
- C’est trop tard.
- Non, non.
- Shirley !
Je vous en prie ! Non !
S’il vous plaît ! S’il vous plaît.
Non !
Oh, Dieu, oh Dieu !
Pas encore !
Pas encore, pas encore !
Oh, ciel.
Oh doux Jésus.
Pardon pour ce que j’ai fait.
S’il vous plaît,
intervenez pour moi.
Oh, doux Jésus.
Aidez-moi, doux Jésus.
Aidez-moi, doux Seigneur.
Je demande pardon
pour ce que j’ai fait.
Je vous en supplie,
intervenez pour moi.
Oh doux Jésus.
Aidez-moi, Marie, Jésus.
Hé, ma Sœur.
Je peux avoir son miroir ?
Bien sûr.
C’est à mon tour
de mourir, vous savez ?
Oui. Je sais.
L’acte final de charité,
enterrer les morts,
prier pour eux
et pour les vivants.
Nous sommes charitables,
pas seulement pour
des raisons humanitaires.
Nous sommes charitables car
nous voulons aussi être sauvés.
Dieu compte sur notre bonté.
Dieu l’exige.
Et quelle bonté
nous montre-t-il ?
« Kyrie eleison ».
Cela signifie :
« Seigneur, ayez pitié.
Jésus Christ, ayez pitié.
Je vous en prie ».
L'esprit criminel.
Depuis 200 ans,
les scientifiques,
les sociologues et les autres
qui se préoccupent
de ces choses-là,
se demandent si une personne
commet des actes de violence
à cause de son environnement
ou de son profil biologique.
Qu'est-ce qui appuie sur le bouton
du crime dans le cerveau humain ?
Si l'on trouve la cause,
peut-on éliminer l'effet ?
Peut-on mettre un terme
à la violence pour toujours ?
Matricule 00G115,
Inspecteur Bruno Goergen,
condamné le 15 mars 2000,
pour possession et
vente illégale d'armes à feu,
et assassinat.
Sentence : 36 ans...
Possibilité de sursis
dans 18 ans.
Tu connais ce mec ?
Non.
Il a vraiment une sale gueule.
"Il a vraiment une sale gueule".
Ce mec.
La première fois que je t'ai vu,
je me suis dit,
"Qu'est-ce que Johnny Basil
fout à Oz ?"
Je me suis souvenu que t'étais parti
aux stups l'année dernière.
Un Macaroni m'a dit que tu t'appelles
Desmond Mobay, c'est ça ?
- Tu vas me dénoncer ?
- Ça dépend.
- De ce que je fais pour toi ?
- Aucun détenu ne sait que je suis flic.
Ça faisait parti du deal
quand j'ai joué les indics pour l'État.
J'ai aussi une nouvelle identité.
Si ces enfoirés découvrent la vérité,
je suis le parfait gibier pour chaque
connard qui veut faire ses preuves.
Et alors ?
Alors une main nettoie l'autre,
mon frère en uniforme.
Tu sais ce dont je me souviens
le plus de toi...
de l'époque où
on patrouillait ensemble ?
Quel genre de petite frappe t'étais.
A bousculer les gens
quand c'était pas nécessaire.
T'as toujours été
un mauvais flic, Goergen.
Ça ne m'a pas surpris quand
j'ai su que t'étais tombé.
Donc tu veux vraiment
que je te dénonce ?
Je serais heureux
de te rendre service.
Heureux que l'on se comprenne.
Excuse, la gouine.
La gouine ?
En général quand un agent
de police arrive à Oz,
je lui fais suivre
une thérapie spéciale.
Pourquoi ?
Ça va être dur pour vous
de passer d'une position d'autorité
à subir des fouilles corporelles.
- Vous pourriez vous sentir humilié.
- Pas moi.
- Vulnérable.
- Non, non.
Très bien, mais si vous ressentez
ce genre de choses,
- sachez que je suis là.
- Merci. A plus.
- Ma femme est une ex-bonne sœur.
- Vraiment ?
Oui. Elle baise comme
une pute de luxe.
Ça doit être toutes
ces années de chasteté.
- Tu sais ce qui me fout en boule ?
- Quoi donc, Mondo ?
Les petites merdes blanches
qui jouent les durs.
Je te comprends.
Je les supporte pas non plus.
Et toi, p'tite fiotte ?
T'en penses quoi ?
Je déteste les nègres
qui roulent du cul.
C'est comme ça
que tu me protèges ?
J'ai fait venir la sécurité
aussi vite que possible.
- Fallait me débarrasser de ces singes.
- Ces singes. Ouais.
Ces nègres, ouais.
J'arrive et je te sauve,
un putain de péquenot blanc.
Je ferais aussi bien
de faire mes valises.
Peut-être que tu devrais
faire tes valises,
parce que si ça arrive encore,
tout le monde saura qui tu es,
et tu seras
un homme mort, Johnny.
Eh, Mobay. T'as oublié ?
- Quoi ?
- Si tu veux te joindre à nous,
- tu dois tuer quelqu'un.
- J'ai pas oublié.
Le nouveau ne veut pas
de violence à Emerald City,
alors si tu fais le coup,
il faut que ça passe
pour un accident.
Fais-le loin d'ici.
Compris.
Hill. Hill.
Je dors.
T'entends ? Je ronfle.
- Il faut que tu m'aides.
- J'aide personne.
Adebisi et les autres
veulent bien de moi
à condition
que je tue quelqu'un.
Et alors ?
Tu veux que je sois ta victime ?
Non.
Je sais qui tuer mais
j'ai besoin que tu coopères.
Le truc que tu sniffes
t'a grillé le cerveau.
Je t'aiderai à tuer personne.
- Mais...
- Non, pas question.
- Mais...
- Eh, la ferme, Mobay.
Tu me fatigues
avec tes conneries.
Laisse-moi dormir.
- On a un problème.
- Quoi ?
- Mon colocataire sait que tu es flic.
- Merde. Comment ?
Qui sait ? Il veut être
payé contre son silence.
- Il veut qu'on parle.
- Où ?
Dans le monte-charge du textile.
On pousse son fauteuil et
on le balance dans le trou.
OK.
Putain.
T'es sûr qu'il va venir ?
Oui.
Tu sais pas ce que t'as
jusqu'à ce qu'on te le prenne.
Toutes les fois où je me suis plaint
de faire les rondes,
je donnerais ma couille droite
pour être dans la neige
à faire ces conneries.
OK, Mobay.
Me voilà. Tu veux quoi ?
Tu croyais m'avoir, hein ?
- Quoi ?
- A la prochaine, la gouine.
Putain, qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Attends, attends. Laisse-moi faire.
Mobay, putain.
Mobay ! Putain, attends. Attends.
Je t'en prie !
Putain !
T'aurais dû me laisser
t'expliquer le plan.
C'est quoi ton problème ?
T'es complètement cinglé ?
Bouclage ! Bouclage !
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Un mec est mort. Un accident.
Loin d'Emerald City.
Je pense sérieusement
à changer de cellule.
- Du calme, mon frère. C'est fini.
- Ouais, c'est ça.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
On s'était mis d'accord.
Hill a cru te reconnaître.
Je suis là parce que je m'inquiète
pour toi, partenaire.
Tu es censé m'envoyer
des emails régulièrement.
Je n'ai pas de nouvelles,
mais quand j'en ai,
- tes rapports ne veulent rien dire.
- J'ai fait du trou.
- T'en prends ?
- Non.
Si, t'en prends.
Ça se voit à ton regard.
- J'ai été obligé.
- C'est fini.
- Je dis au Lieutenant de te sortir.
- Non !
Shuman veut que ça soit fait,
et je suis à deux doigts
de chopper ces mecs.
Je sais que j'ai merdé, mais je peux
arranger les choses.
Je peux le faire, Kina.
Fais-moi confiance.
OK, mais je veux des nouvelles
tous les jours.
Tous les jours, OK ?
M. le directeur, on doit
vous arranger un peu.
- Allez-y.
- Voici Cassandra et Betty.
- Maquillage et coiffure.
- C'est quoi ce foutoir ?
Le directeur fait
une annonce publique.
Oh, c'est vrai. J'avais oublié.
Mesdames et Messieurs,
je suis honoré de...
Ça va ?
Je pense que
j'ai chopé la grippe.
On se dépêche, les gars.
M. le directeur,
votre femme est arrivée.
- Mary.
- Il faut qu'on parle.
Excusez-moi.
On commence bientôt.
Monsieur, s'il vous plaît.
Excusez-moi.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Un journaliste vient de me poser
des questions sur ton frère.
Je savais que ça allait arriver.
Demain, "La Tribune"
va publier
que Mark est en perpétuité,
ils voulaient savoir si tu en parlerais.
J'ai plein de choses à dire,
mais rien d'imprimable.
M. le directeur, excusez-moi.
On essaie de faire
notre petite vidéo.
On a un emploi
du temps très serré.
Excuse-moi. Je suis désolé.
Merci beaucoup. Désolé.
OK, vous terminez, d'accord ?
- Qu'on puisse en finir.
- OK.
- C'est pas si terrible.
- Oh, vraiment ?
On avait prévu qu'un journaliste
irait fouiller la merde un jour.
On peut utiliser ça
à notre avantage.
- Comment ?
- Votre frère a commis un meurtre,
mais vous l'avez forcé
à se dénoncer.
Trois mois après les faits.
La presse n'a pas
besoin de savoir ça.
Je me sens comme Ronald Reagan.
On a aussi laissé savoir
que votre fille s'est faite violer.
Le public adorera le fait
que vous connaissez
tous les aspects de la violence.
Je ne vais pas exploiter
le viol d'Arnet pour être élu.
Leo, les gens ne votent pas
pour un candidat pour ses convictions
ou ses déclarations ou
aucune de ces conneries.
Ils élisent un père, un mari,
un pote avec qui ils peuvent
boire une bière,
quelqu'un qui comprenne
la douleur
parce qu'il a souffert aussi.
Et vous avez souffert, Leo.
Faites-les pleurer pour vous.
J'ai dit non. C'est non.
Alors quittez la course.
J'ai besoin d'un gouverneur Adjoint
qui ait des couilles.
Ouvrez cette putain de porte !
Je suis un père de famille,
et il n'y a rien de plus dur
pour un père de famille
que de voir ceux qu'il aime
souffrir ou causer de la souffrance.
Le crime de mon frère
nous a dévastés.
Le viol de ma fille aussi.
Une nouvelle étude prétend
que certains hommes
sont programmés pour commettre
des crimes violents.
Qu'ils ont des malformations
du cerveau.
Qu'ils ont moins de matière grise
dans le lobe préfrontal
derrière les yeux.
Il leur manque le morceau
qui contient la rage.
Si c'est vrai, ces hommes
sont prédestinés
au viol et au meurtre.
Ils ne sont donc pas responsables.
L'anatomie est le destin.
J'en ai rien à foutre de ce PQ.
Prends-le, ton putain de PQ, OK ?
Bouclage !
Bouclage ! Bouclage !
McManus, tu sais pas t'amuser ?
- Allô ?
- Tim ?
- Ouais.
- C'est Diane.
- Ah ouais ?
- Comment ça va ?
Bien.
Je t'ai écrit mais
je n'ai pas eu de réponse.
Tu as reçu ma lettre ?
Ouais. Je l'ai reçue.
J'ai été occupé.
On m'a dit que t'étais
à la tête de l'unité B.
Mes jeunes se comportent bien ?
Diane, tu veux quoi ?
Savoir si tu vas bien.
Je vais bien. Je dois y aller.
- Eh, salut.
- Tim.
- Eh.
- Comment ça va ?
En vérité ? Diane me manque.
Em City me manque.
Je suis constipé en permanence.
J'ai réussi à complètement
foirer ma vie.
Voilà comment ça va.
La constipation...
Ça peut se régler.
C'est ça.
On va prendre une bière ?
Non merci. J'ai un rendez-vous.
A chaque fois que je te demande
de faire un truc,
t'as autre chose à faire.
Je deviens parano. Tu m'en veux ?
Quand Glynn m'a viré,
t'as fait quoi ?
Je t'ai tout de suite appelé.
T'as été très compréhensif,
et tu m'as piqué mon boulot.
Du temporaire. J'ai dit à Glynn
que je ne voulais pas te remplacer.
C'est moi qui t'ai fait entrer à Oz.
- T'aurais dû démissionner.
- Tim.
- Faut que j'y aille.
- Tim, lâche-moi avec ça.
Kareem Said.
D'après ce dossier,
t'es un vrai chieur.
C'est seulement
une interprétation.
On pourrait dire que j'aspire
à la justice quand il n'y en a pas.
J'aspire à la paix et au calme.
Les directives du directeur Glynn
sont simples : pas de violence.
J'applaudis vos directives.
Je déteste la violence.
C'est très aimable de ta part.
Je pense changer des trucs
et j'espère que tu resteras calme.
Ça dépend. Quels changements ?
Patience. Patience.
On doit être aussi patient envers notre
prochain qu'Allah l'est envers nous.
Ça ne te dérange pas que je te cite ?
J'ai trouvé ça au fond du tiroir.
McManus a dû l'oublier.
Je l'ai survolé.
- Et ?
- J'ai pas trouvé ça très intéressant.
C'est trop pharisaïque.
Tu peux y aller.
$100. Vas-y.
C'est tout si t'en veux.
C'est marrant.
Matricule 00K251,
Kevin Ketchum,
alias Supreme Allah.
Condamné le 22 mars 2000,
pour homicide volontaire.
Sentence : 25 ans.
Possibilité de sursis dans 10 ans.
Voilà ton mentor.
Il va t'aider à t'acclimater
à la vie à Emerald City.
Kevin Ketchum, Kareem Said.
Ketchum c'est mon nom officiel.
Mon vrai nom c'est Supreme Allah.
OK. On y va, Allah.
- C'est qui ça ?
- Supreme Allah.
Je l'ai connu dans la rue.
C'est quoi comme nom,
Supreme Allah ?
Il fait partie des 5%.
Quels 5% ?
Les 5%.
Il pense que 5% des Noirs
sont illuminés par
la connaissance divine.
Ils croient aussi
que les Noirs sont Dieu
et que les Blancs sont le diable.
Comme les musulmans,
sauf qu'ils fument de l'herbe,
ils dealent, ils font
ce qu'ils ont à faire.
Oh, merde.
Il va partager ma cellule.
Merde.
Bye.
Peace, mon frère.
Écoute, j'achète pas
ta merde, mon gars.
J'en ai connu des 5%,
avec vos allures de prophètes,
à raconter des conneries
sur la Terre.
Tu sais, on est coincés ici.
Ensemble.
Et j'ai pas besoin
de tes préchi-précha, OK ?
- Ouais, OK.
- Très bien.
On t'appelle Poet, hein ?
Un peu, oui.
Je peux lire tes trucs ?
Pourquoi tu veux lire mes trucs ?
J'aime la poésie.
Tu sais, moi je sais pas écrire.
- Commence à la page 16.
- Merci.
Ils ont mis certains de mes trucs
dans cette anthologie.
Bon sang.
Eh, c'est bon, mon gars.
Merde.
Plus de stylos.
Il faut que tu t'alignes
avec nous.
Ça me pose pas de problème
de bosser avec vous.
Tu comprends pas
ce que je te dis.
Oh, je comprends très bien, Arif.
Le truc, c'est que je ne t'appartiens
pas plus qu'au diable.
Tu m'obéiras.
Je ne te conseille pas
de me toucher, mon gars.
Ça ne nous avance à rien.
Calmez-vous.
Supreme Allah,
tu te dis musulman.
Nous on pense
que ta manière de voir,
c'est une déformation de la vérité.
On ne veut pas
que tu corrompes les esprits
de nos jeunes frères d'Oz.
Je dirai ce que je pense
tant que je serai ici.
Et ceux qui écouteront,
écouteront.
Ceux qui n'écouteront pas,
tant pis pour eux.
Merci.
Vous voulez que je reste ?
Sortez donc.
- Eh toi.
- Oui.
Qu'est-ce que tu magouilles,
Adebisi ?
Moi ? Rien.
Rien ? Et je suis compris
dans ton "rien" ?
La Terre va trembler.
Je suis venu t'avertir.
Protège-toi.
- Gros comment, le tremblement ?
- Gros.
Mais toi, t'es tranquille avec moi.
Vraiment, tu me fais honneur
avec ton offre de protection.
- Et tu refuses encore ?
- Avec regret.
On peut refuser un rencard
qu'un certain nombre de fois.
Tu pourrais me dire
ce qui se passe.
Décompte !
Tu verras bien.
J'ai décidé d'annuler le conseil
qui se réunissait
de manière régulière
et de remplacer ce système
par des mandataires
qui auront pour mission
de faire connaître les griefs
et de maintenir l'ordre.
Ces mandataires sont
Simon Adebisi,
Chucky Pancamo
et Enrique Morales.
Après vous avoir tous
rencontrés un par un,
j'ai décidé de transférer
plusieurs d'entre vous à Pop Gen.
Les hommes suivants
suivront l'Agent Johnson :
97H813, Henke :
99S812, Sands :
98B643, Blakely :
97 S532, Simpson :
95J932, Jarvis :
98H432, Hoyt.
C'est nul !
On t'a pas demandé
ton avis, Hoyt.
Assez parlé.
Attrapez vos affaires !
C'est du délire.
Faire d'Adebisi, Pancamo et Morales
des mandataires ?
C'est les pires crapules ici.
Et transférer tous les Ariens
et les Bikers ?
- C'est quoi cette logique ?
- Je ne suis pas Tim McManus.
Je n'essaie pas de créer un Oz
façon arc-en-ciel.
J'ai lu leurs dossiers.
Ils ont tous été à l'origine
d'incidents violents.
- Et pas Adebisi ?
- Va falloir me faire confiance.
J'aurais aimé que vous me teniez
au courant des changements
- avant de les annoncer.
- Pas mon genre.
- Effectivement.
- Si ça ne vous plaît pas,
vous pouvez suivre
Hoyt et les autres.
- Bonne idée.
- Je remplis le formulaire.
- Le plus tôt sera le mieux.
- Le plus tôt, oui.
Ouais.
Ah, ouais...
Tu le savais ?
Que tu serais mandataire ?
Ouais, ouais,
mais j'avais juré le secret.
- Pourquoi je suis pas mandataire ?
- Demande à Querns.
Et pourquoi aucun nouveau
n'est musulman ?
- Demande à Querns.
- On avait un accord, Adebisi.
C'est vrai. On en avait un.
Maintenant tu m'excuseras,
j'ai des affaires à régler.
Non, non, non, non.
- Il faut qu'on parle, Querns.
- Plus tard.
- Maintenant.
- Johnson.
On parlera plus tard.
Reculez. Reculez.
- Garde !
- Lâche-le tout de suite !
Dégage !
Bon sang,
faut l'emmener à l'hôpital.
Unité B.
Amenez un brancard !
- Que s'est-il passé ?
- Il s'est fait violer.
Gloria, vous n'avez pas à...
- C'est bon.
- Non.
Tim, c'est bon. On tire les rideaux
et on fait une anuscopie.
Quand j'ai été élu gouverneur,
la criminalité était hors de contrôle,
mais on a travaillé
- pour faire passer la loi...
- Eh, tu peux baisser le son ?
J'attends mon feuilleton.
Mac vient de quitter
Felicia... encore une fois.
Putain, baisse le son.
Pourquoi t'es toujours ronchon ?
- Eh, tu fais quoi ?
- Je peins.
Ils viennent
de repeindre les cellules.
Je peins une fresque, connard.
Un portrait.
- De qui ?
- De moi.
Je veux laisser une trace
après mon exécution.
Qu'est-ce qui te fait croire
que le prochain locataire
voudra passer ses derniers jours
à mater ta sale gueule ?
- Ma sale gueule, négro ?
- Enculé.
Mes petites chéries montent le ton ?
On cherche la fessée ?
Lopresti, qu'est-ce que
tu fous encore ici ?
Shirley Bellinger a dit au directeur
que tu la baisais tous les soirs.
Cette salope a failli me faire
virer, mais j'ai persuadé Glynn
que c'était
une sale menteuse.
Elle mentait pas.
Tu lui bouffais la chatte.
- Putain !
- Je veux plus t'entendre
parler de cette chienne. OK ?
C'est plus pareil
sans Shirley.
Ouais.
Tu tousses beaucoup.
Ouais, pédale,
je peux pas dormir la nuit.
Oh, et t'es tout cerné le matin ?
Tu devrais peut-être
aller à l'hosto.
Non. Je veux pas mourir
dans un hôpital.
- Tu préfères mourir ici ?
- Je préfèrerais mourir
en bronzant sur la Côte d'Azur dans
les bras d'un Apollon de 17 ans,
- mais c'est la vie.
- Tu devrais peut-être y aller.
Merci pour tes inquiétudes, Moïse.
- Tu deviens pédé, Deyell ?
- Tu vas fermer ta gueule, oui ?
Quand je mourrai, sale nègre.
Aïe ! Putain ! Ma main !
Ma main, putain !
Oh, merde !
En général si vous frappez un mur,
c'est le mur qui gagne, Deyell.
Ouais, Moïse est pas réputé
pour ses muscles cérébraux.
J'ai plus de cervelle dans
mon petit doigt que toi.
Votre petit doigt est en miettes.
Essayez de garder
ce plâtre en bon état.
Il faut le garder pendant
six semaines. C'est bon.
Dr. Nathan, vous n'êtes pas allée voir
Ginzburg dernièrement ?
Non, j'ai dû prendre un congé.
Je pensais que
Dr. Prestopnik le voyait.
Prestopnik n'est pas venu une fois.
La ferme, Deyell.
Encore.
Vous avez eu des frissons,
des sueurs, des essoufflements ?
Oui, un trifecta.
Je devrais vous transférer
dans la section SIDA.
Quand j'ai été condamné à mort
pour avoir étouffé Antonio Nappa,
je me suis dit :
"Ça va être marrant".
Marrant ?
De voir ce qui me tue en premier :
l'État ou la maladie.
La maladie est en train de gagner.
Matricule 00K414,
Patrick Keenan,
condamné le 25 mars 2000,
pour agression et viol.
Sentence : 12 ans.
Possibilité de sursis
dans sept ans.
- Eh, O'Reily.
- Eh.
Tu connais Patrick Keenan ?
Non.
Patrick, voici Ryan O'Reily.
J'ai entendu parler de toi.
Toi et ton frère étiez à la tête
du gang de Bridget Street.
Ouais.
Eh ben, c'est un... un joli trèfle.
Ouais, merci.
Mon porte-bonheur.
- T'es là pour quoi ?
- Viol, agression.
- Vraiment ?
- C'est Patrick qui s'est fait Nathan.
T'as violé le Dr. Nathan ?
- Ouais.
- Pourquoi ?
Je sais pas. J'étais d'humeur.
Il était "d'humeur".
Tiens donc ?
Content de faire
ta connaissance, Keenan.
Toi et moi, on pourrait
parler business un jour.
J'aimerais beaucoup
travailler pour les O'Reily.
OK. A plus.
Où tu vas comme ça ?
Eh, Boucle d'Or, tu veux
une glace au chocolat ?
Non !
Un milligramme
de tranquillisant.
- Vous êtes sûre ?
- Vous suggérez quoi ? La psychothérapie ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe,
Adebisi ?
Tu laisses ces cons
faire chier mon frère ?
- On était d'accord !
- Du calme, O'Reily,
avant de faire un anévrisme.
J'ai déjà parlé à Tidd et Browne.
- N'est-ce pas ?
- Oui.
- Brown ?
- Ouais, mec.
Ce genre de conneries
n'arrivera plus.
OK ?
Il va bien ?
Il est tellement bourré
de tranquillisants
qu'on le croirait
dans le coma.
Est-ce vraiment un mal ?
O'Reily... J'ai une question.
Stanislofky...
viens là, assieds-toi.
J'ai fait mes recherches
sur ce que s'est passé ici récemment.
J'ai lu le dossier sur la mort
d'un certain Ralph Galino.
Tragique. La drogue
est un sérieux problème.
Ouais. Sauf qu'il n'en prenait pas.
- Alors comment il a fait une overdose ?
- Mystère.
J'ai compris que toi et Galino
ne vous entendiez pas.
Qui a dit ça ?
Tu m'as posé une question ?
Parce que t'as pas le droit
de me poser de questions.
T'es mon suspect numéro un
pour la mort de Galino.
T'es mon seul suspect.
Je vais te surveiller,
perché comme l'aigle du Tsar.
T'as dit qu'on devrait attendre.
Alors on attend et on voit
ce qui se passe.
O'Reily va voir les gardiens et leur dit
que toi et moi on a tué Galino.
O'Reily a dit ça ? Toi et moi ?
Oui. Alors occupe-toi de lui.
On trucide O'Reily, ils auront
les preuves qu'ils veulent.
Non merci. C'est bientôt
mon anniversaire.
Je veux pas
le passer en isolement.
Je sais que ce pédé de Russe
est venu déblatérer sur moi,
mais faut pas croire ce fils de pute.
Je le crois pas.
Toi non plus d'ailleurs.
OK, très bien. Mais c'est censé
être ton pote, non ?
Je parie qu'il t'a rien dit
à propos du portable.
Le portable ? Quel portable ?
Le téléphone de Ralph Galino.
C'est pour ça qu'il a tué le Rital.
Tu crois qui maintenant ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Druke, c'est quoi le problème ?
Arrête ton char.
Donne-moi le portable.
Donne-le moi.
Qu'est-ce qui va
m'arriver maintenant ?
Voyons... peut-être
que tu vas crever.
Ils m'assassinent ! Gardes !
Gardes, gardes ! Gardes !
Ça suffit, ça suffit.
Contre le mur. Allez, là-bas !
Tout le monde
cherche une excuse.
"J'ai tué cet homme parce que :
Un, on a abusé de moi
quand j'étais petit :
deux, j'avais des parents de merde :
trois, j'ai grandi dans la misère :
quatre, toutes les raisons
citées précédemment".
Si la seule chose que vous connaissez
dès le berceau, c'est la violence...
quelles sont vos autres options ?
- Merde !
- Nyet !
De quelle autre raison
vous avez besoin ?
Bonjour, Bob.
Bob, s'il te plaît.
Quand vas-tu arrêter
de me faire la gueule ?
J'ai dit que j'étais désolé
de pas t'avoir dit que
je creusais un tunnel
et de pas t'avoir demandé
de t'échapper avec moi.
Décompte !
- Comment il va ?
- Pas bien.
88K214, 77P326,
98K514, 97B412.
Beecher.
Bouge ton cul de là.
Laissez-le tranquille.
- Beecher, tout de suite.
- Il est là.
Pourquoi il devrait
se mettre en rang ?
Les règles, c'est les règles.
Va te faire foutre.
- Quoi ?
- Va te faire foutre, toi et tes règles.
Rebadow, j'attendais ça de Keller,
mais pas de toi.
Les enfants de cet homme
ont été kidnappés,
on a coupé la main de son fils.
Beecher souffre, c'est évident.
Pourquoi le torturer ?
C'est vrai ! Ouais !
Continue.
- 96Q415, 18T304...
- C'est bon, du calme !
- Du calme maintenant !
- Qui aurait cru ça de toi ?
Ferme vos gueules !
Il y a quelques années,
j'ai été attaqué par des Noirs
- et j'ai atterri à l'hôpital.
- Je me souviens.
Les bleus ont disparu,
mais j'étais transi de peur.
C'est normal.
Je n'avais pas eu aussi peur
depuis que
mon exécution a capoté.
Tuer Raul Hernandez, aussi...
aussi terrible que ça soit, aussi...
Je ne sais pas.
Je me sens en vie.
Je n'ai pas peur de mourir.
- Apprends-moi.
- T'apprendre à quoi ?
A boxer.
Tu plaisantes ?
Je veux apprendre à me défendre.
Rebadow, j'ai ni le temps
ni l'envie. Dégage.
- Moi je peux t'apprendre.
- Cyril.
Non, je peux si je veux.
OK. D'abord...
tu dois apprendre à te tenir.
Putain, Cyril.
Eh, Rebadow.
- Donne-moi ton gâteau, papi.
- Non.
Tu vas me donner ton gâteau,
ou je te botte
ton derrière rabougri.
OK.
Tu l'as eu, ton gâteau !
C'était bon, mec ?
T'as loupé un super déjeuner,
mais je t'ai ramené un truc.
Toby, prends-la.
Faut manger quelque chose.
Prends-la.
Prends cette putain
d'orange et mange. Allez.
Y'a rien de tel qu'une orange
fraîchement pressée.
Les compagnons de cellule.
C'est comme le mariage.
Rebadow t'ignore toujours ?
Pire. On dirait
une personne différente.
C'est comme si un extra-terrestre
l'avait remplacé.
C'est vrai qu'il a changé.
C'est flippant.
Passé un certain âge,
les gens ne devraient plus changer.
Chut. Le voilà.
- M. Morales...
- Eh. du calme, Rebadow.
Je veux vous parler.
Laisse-le, Chico.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Quand j'ai accepté
de tuer Hernandez,
vous avez dit que je pouvais avoir ce
que je voulais en échange.
C'est vrai. Et maintenant tu veux
que je paie ma dette ?
Oui.
Que puis-je faire pour toi ?
Je veux que vous me laissiez
tuer quelqu'un d'autre.
Papa !
Papa ?
Papa ?
Il fait souvent ces rêves ?
Depuis que ses enfants
ont été kidnappés.
- Je lui parlerai.
- Soeur Peter Marie, aussi.
Vu sa relation avec Beecher,
son comportement elle plutôt...
léger à ce sujet.
C'est faux.
Je peux pas m'empêcher de penser
que c'est en partie ma faute.
Aussi choquant que cela
puisse paraître, Keller,
tout sur cette planète
ne tourne pas autour de vous.
Keller a raison.
C'est à cause de lui.
Les doutes qu'il a ancrés en moi
sur mes voeux,
sur mes capacités
de psychologue...
Mais Pete, Beecher
a besoin de vous.
Ray, je sais.
Vous vous souvenez
de ce que je vous ai dit,
que je présentais une façade
pour affronter chaque jour ?
- Bien sûr.
- Je ne peux pas réconforter Tobias.
Je ne le regarde pas
dans les yeux,
parce que si je le fais,
ma façade va s'effondrer.
Et c'est pire que
de ne pas l'aider.
Beecher n'est pas sorti
de sa cellule depuis deux jours.
Il reste allongé
sur sa paillasse,
à pleurnicher
comme une tapette.
Bien.
C'est ce qu'il y a de vraiment
élégant dans mon plan.
On ne touche pas Beecher
physiquement,
et pourtant les dégâts
sont bien pires.
Il est temps de passer
aux étapes trois et quatre.
Hank ?
Ouais. Je veux que
tu livres l'autre colis.
Oui. Celui dont on a parlé.
Salut.
Vous devriez arrêter de fumer,
mon Père.
Je sais.
C'est mauvais pour ma santé.
Il est interdit de fumer
dans les lieux publics
- et les bâtiments administratifs.
- Ça vous dérange ?
Oui !
Bonjour, Tobias.
Merci. Attendez dehors,
s'il vous plaît.
Assieds-toi, Toby.
Je sais ce dont il s'agit, Papa.
Le FBI a trouvé Gary ?
Oui.
Le corps de Gary. Il est mort.
Oui.
Je le savais.
Je l'ai su quand
j'ai su pour la main.
Et Holly ? Des nouvelles ?
Non, non. Pas encore.
Je voudrais aller
à l'enterrement de Gary.
On a déjà fait les préparatifs.
Je veux qu'il soit enterré
à côté de sa mère.
Je veux voir les tombes que j'ai
creusées les unes à côté des autres.
Oh, mon fils. Mon fils.
C'est marrant,
je n'arrive pas à pleurer.
Je n'ai plus de larmes.
Chris, je veux...
te demander quelque chose.
Je ne t'avais pas demandé parce que
je ne voulais pas savoir.
Je sais que tu as été marié
tout ce temps,
et je me demande
si j'ai été le premier...
tu sais, le premier homme.
Je suppose que ça répond
à ma question.
Non. Non, pas du tout.
Je pense seulement...
que c'est une drôle
de conversation à avoir
juste avant l'enterrement
de ton fils.
Le FBI dit que tu es coupable
de meurtres d'homos.
Le FBI...
Je ne te demande pas
si tu as commis ces meurtres.
Je te demande si tu as déjà ressenti
ça pour un autre homme.
Non.
Je n'ai jamais ressenti ça.
Je te jure, Toby.
Tu mens.
- Toby, je ne suis pas...
- Tu mens.
Fais de beaux rêves, mon ange.
Oui.
Entrez.
Asseyez-vous.
Merci.
Une cigarette ?
C'est mauvais pour la santé.
Avant d'être exécutée,
Shirley Bellinger
m'a donné un indice quant
à la personne qui l'a mise enceinte.
Elle a dit : "Ni la pluie, ni la neige",
ce qui fait partie du vieil adage
de la Poste américaine.
Comme vous distribuez
le courrier aux condamnés,
je me dis
que vous étiez le père.
Vous vous trompez.
J'ai n'ai jamais
couché avec Shirley.
Pas que je voulais pas.
Même si vous aviez raison,
ça change quoi ? Elle est morte.
Je ne vous connais pas,
Schillinger.
Je ne sais pas ce dont vous êtes
capable. Je connais votre réputation...
...bien sûr.
Mais même, j'ai du mal à croire
que vous couperiez la main
d'un petit enfant.
Que vous tueriez un jeune garçon
qui n'a jamais fait
de mal à personne.
Je n'ai pas touché un cheveu
du gosse de Beecher.
Je vais vous dire un truc.
C'est Beecher
qui a retrouvé votre fils.
Je sais.
Vous savez.
Oui, il l'a fait pour m'emmerder,
- comme il a fait avec Andrew.
- Non.
Il l'a fait pour se rattraper
de ce qui est arrivé à Andrew.
Il l'a fait en espérant
faire oublier la haine
qui existe entre vous deux.
Ça, je vous le jure
sur mes voeux de prêtre.
Si je vous mens,
que je sois damné à tout jamais.
Schillinger,
faites que rien n'arrive
à la fille de Beecher.
S'il vous reste
un peu de décence,
si vous...
Si vous avez une âme,
faites libérer cette petite fille.
Tu m'as demandé
de fouiner, hein ?
Alors j'ai fouiné ici, rien.
J'ai fouiné là, que dalle.
Puis j'ai trouvé
un vrai gisement.
- Raconte.
- "Raconte" ?
J'ai des infos en or
et on n'a même pas
encore parlé prix.
- Combien ?
- Eh, j'ai des gosses aussi, hein ?
Ma petite, Tabitha,
elle a vraiment besoin
de voir un dentiste.
Ses dents sont
complètement pourries...
Zabitz...
S'il te plaît, pas maintenant.
OK. Mais tu paies
les factures du dentiste,
jusqu'à la dernière.
OK.
Dis-moi ce que
tu sais de l'enlèvement.
D'après une source très sûre,
une source de l'extérieur,
c'était une commande.
Le criminel s'appelle
Bob "Gros Cul" Towland.
Qui l'a engagé ?
- J'hésite.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que d'après ce que
j'ai compris, c'est quelqu'un
qui t'est très cher.
Qui, bon sang ?
Chris Keller.
Tu peux t'en assurer ?
J'en suis aussi sûr que n'importe qui
sur n'importe quoi.
Je veux que
vous sachiez la vérité.
C'est mon boulot.
Il m'a fait des sales coups,
mais ça...
ça n'a pas de sens.
Les mecs comme Keller
sont des chasseurs.
Tuer est un sport.
Tu penses que
t'es un super client ?
Eh ben...
disons que j'ai eu ma dose
d'interrogatoires.
T'as déjà entendu parler
d'un mec appelé
Mark Karachi ?
- Non.
- Byam Lewis ?
- Non.
- Et Bryce Tibbetts ?
Non, non et non.
Ces trois hommes
étaient homosexuels.
Les trois traînaient
dans le même bar gay.
Les trois sont morts.
Après avoir été
sodomisés et torturés.
- Ah ouais ?
- Ouais.
Mais voilà ce
qu'il y a de curieux.
Tu as emménagé dans cette ville
en décembre 97.
Ces hommes ont été tués
en janvier, mars et mai 98.
T'es arrivé à Oz
en juin de cette année,
et d'un seul coup,
les meurtres ont cessé.
Quelle drôle de coïncidence.
On sait que tu es coupable.
Vous avez des preuves ?
Des témoins ?
Tu as fréquenté le même bar.
Ça ne fait pas
de moi un assassin,
pas plus que ça fait
de moi un pédé.
Et pourtant t'en es un, non ?
Un pédé ?
- Tu suce la bite de Tobias Beecher.
- Non, il suce la mienne.
D'après les rumeurs, vous avez
une relation houleuse, hein ?
Beaucoup de douleur
de chaque côté.
T'es impliqué dans le dernier truc ?
Je ne comprends pas.
La mort de son fils.
Moi, tuer son fils ?
Vous déconnez ?
Depuis quand le FBI déconne ?
Extinction des feux !
Comment ça va ?
T'étais bien calme aujourd'hui.
Je peux te demander un truc ?
Que devrais-je faire
si je trouve qui a tué Gary ?
Tu devrais le zigouiller.
Je t'aiderai.
Ah ouais ?
- Avec plaisir.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?!
T'as tué mon fils !
Lâche-le !
Tu penses que je ferais ça ?!
T'es capable de tout !
Salope !
- Je viens chercher mon fric.
- Paie-le.
- Ta gamine a les dents pourries ?
- Ouais.
Tu verrais sa bouche.
Que des caries.
Génétique...
ou environnement ?
Comme pour le reste,
la société cherche...
la "formule magique"...
la réponse facile,
parce que plus la réponse
est complexe,
plus on est terrifiés.
Est-ce que la racine
de la violence
est plus profonde,
plus sombre ?
Qu'en est-il...
du "mal incarné" ?
Peut-être que nous, les humains,
sommes le mal par définition.
Peut-être que le mal est enraciné,
intégré dans nos âmes.
Flip Wilson disait :
"C'est le diable
qui m'a dit de la faire".
Il avait peut-être raison.
Ou peut-être pas.
Allô, Hank ? Ouais.
Je veux que tu livres
l'autre paquet
à la maison des grand parents.
Non... vivante.
Il y a toutes sortes de mots
d'argot pour dire prison...
"La taule", "La cabane",
"A l'ombre".
Mais mon préféré
c'est "Le Cling".
C'est parce que ce mot vient
du bruit que les chaînes faisaient
dans les années 1400.
Ils avaient ces énormes
foutues chaînes en fer.
Les prisonniers n'avaient pas
le droit de parler,
alors quand ils se déplaçaient
dans le donjon,
tout ce qu'on entendait
c'était "cling".
Écoutez tous.
Les noms suivants
sont transférés
hors d'Emerald City.
96G333,
Guccione.
91H481,
Hardin.
94S727,
Shirner.
Prenez vos affaires
et suivez l'agent Titon.
Salut, à bientôt, les pigeons.
Taille-moi une pipe.
Faut que vous répariez ce bon sang
de truc avant midi.
Querns...
Comment pouvez-vous approuver
ce que fait Adebisi ?
La drogue,
le sexe ?
Il a même un rideau dans sa cellule
pour dissimuler ses péchés.
Je n'ai pas à vous expliquer
pourquoi j'approuve
ce que j'approuve.
Je sais.
Mais je peux aller
en parler au directeur.
Je peux vous envoyer
au trou.
Vous savez, d'autres ont essayé
de me faire taire.
Les autres c'est pas moi, Said.
Si vous voulez déménager
dans un autre quartier,
je peux arranger ça.
Sinon, faites ce que vous faites
le mieux, priez Allah.
Le reste du temps,
fermez-la.
Arif...
Regarde là-bas.
Regarde !
Tu vois ce qui se passe ?
Oui.
Alors comment peux-tu
ne rien faire ?
Tu as dit que
tu voulais diriger.
Au nom de tout
ce qui est sacré...
dirige.
Bien. Ok, salut.
Salut.
C'est à toi.
J'essaie d'avoir cinq minutes
avec vous depuis des jours.
Tu les as maintenant.
Ne les perds pas à te plaindre.
D'abord, quand vous avez établi
ce nouveau système,
pourquoi n'ai-je pas été
nommé au conseil ?
18% de la population
de Oz est musulmane.
En tant que chef, je m'attends
à ce que nous soyons représentés.
Je sais que la population musulmane
est importante,
mais en terme de force,
vous semblez tous...
aller à la dérive.
Attendez un peu, Querns.
Vous allez sentir la force
de notre pouvoir.
Tu me menaces ?
Tu me menaces ?
Fous-moi le camp d'ici.
Mais Supreme et moi
on parlait juste.
Je ne veux pas
que tu t'approches de lui.
Mais j'écoutais juste
ce qu'il avait à dire.
C'est un ordre.
Oui, monsieur.
Maintenant vas-t'en.
Je dois prier.
Et à ce moment là,
j'ai entendu une voix.
une voix tonitruante avec...
une qualité nasale
comme Eazy-E, qui disait
"La vérité ne fait pas d'ombre
car elle se regorge de soleil
comme les éponges.
Saute à l'élastique
dans l'abîme.
Tiens la vérité bien serrée
dans ton poing.
Qu'est-ce que je t'ai dit,
Ketchum ?
Je m'appelle
Supreme Allah.
Ton nom c'est
Kevin Ketchum.
T'es rien d'autre
qu'un bon à rien de bas quartier.
Et toi t'es quoi, Arif ?
A part un type qui joue
les Kareem Said ?
J'te préviens
pour la dernière fois.
Adebisi.
C'est moi.
Faut qu'on parle
de ce fameux Ketchum.
Ah, ouais ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
ils est dangereux
pour nous deux.
Ouais ? Comment ça ?
Il fait tous ces convertis
de tes gars, des miens.
J'ai pas peur.
Tu devrais.
Bientôt, ils suivront
ses ordres.
Supreme et moi
on s'est mis d'accord.
Tu ne peux pas
lui faire confiance.
Tu suggères quoi ?
Tu devrais faire comme tu fais
face à un ennemi.
Tu veux dire le tuer ?
Je croyais que vous, les musulmans
étiez contre le meurtre.
Ah ouais, mais c'est Ok
si je le tue pour toi, hein ?
- Adebisi.
- Non.
J'ai dit non.
Si tu le veux mort,
attrape un couteau.
Bonjour.
Eh, Sean, qu'est-ce que
tu fais ici ?
Le nouveau responsable
d'Em City, Querns,
- lui et moi on est pas d'accord.
- Ah, ouais ?
Le directeur m'a mis
à la réception,
mais je suis pas fait
pour le travail de bureau.
Si tu veux mon avis...
J'serai pas là longtemps.
Écoute,
tu sais ce que j'ai dit
quand j'étais en colère
parce que tu n'avais pas démissionné
quand j'ai été viré. Des conneries.
Compte tenu
de ma conduite à l'époque,
comment pouvais-je oser juger
ce que quelqu'un d'autre faisait ?
Tim, tu... tu as l'air
tellement éclairé.
Tu as trouvé la foi ?
Mieux que ça.
Un psy abordable.
Dînons ensemble ce soir.
Ok, mais c'est toi qui offre.
Ok.
Eh, Andrea.
C'est déjà le matin ?
La nuit a été tranquille ?
Si on peut appeler
deux bagarres au poing
et de la pénétration anale
tranquilles, ouais.
Qui s'est bagarré ?
Le motard, Hoyt,
et l'un des Irlandais, Keenan.
- Enculé !
- Va te faire foutre !
Putain de viol...
Arrêtez, arrêtez.
Allez.
Martin, quoi de neuf ?
Comme vous le savez,
Sean Murphy
a été transféré en dehors
d'Em City
et j'ai nommé Travis Smith
comme surveillant général.
Le problème c'est que les gardes
sont dévoués à Murphy.
Alors je vous demande
de les remplacer par ceux-ci.
OK. C'est chose faite.
Mobay !
Occupez-vous
de ces transferts tout de suite.
Oui, monsieur.
- La campagne se passe bien ?
- Super.
On devrait parler
au directeur.
Non, il lèche le cul
à Devlin.
Il ne s'intéresse pas
à nos problèmes.
On devrait
en parler au syndicat.
Parler de quoi
au syndicat ?
Mon pote Querns remplace
tous les gardes d'Em City
avec des gens de son choix.
Il a le droit.
Ouais, mais seulement
il ne choisit que des noirs.
Oh, et bien la bonne nouvelle
c'est que vous pouvez venir travailler
pour moi au quartier B.
Vraiment ?
Ouais, j'ai besoin de muscles,
croyez-moi.
Je vais aller voir Glynn.
Je m'occupe des transferts.
- Merci, Tim.
- Bonne idée.
- Eh, on faisait bonne équipe, non ?
- Ouais.
Ok.
- Je m'occupe des démarches.
- Bien.
- Eh, Leo.
- Quoi ?
Ça vous embête pas
que Querns s'entoure
uniquement d'employés noirs ?
Je lui ai dit qu'il pouvait diriger
son quartier comme il l'entendait
tant que le taux de violence
restait bas.
Ok ? Mais depuis que Querns
a repris les choses en main
il n'y a eu aucun problème majeur
à Em City.
Ouais.
Pourvu que ça dure.
Il y a un resto Roumain
au coin de la rue.
C'est un trou à rats,
mais la nourriture est délicieuse,
surtout le "chumala de mia".
Tiens, tiens,
les deux Dupont.
Paraît que vous deux,
les enfants de chœur,
travaillez à nouveau ensemble
au quartier B.
C'est vrai.
Je viens de me faire
transférer, moi aussi.
Apparemment le directeur
était choqué que Querns
n'ait que des gardes noirs
à Em City.
Tu vas travailler
à Emerald City ?
Ouais.
La vie est pleine d'ironie,
n'est-ce pas ?
Bon sang, Ginzburg,
j'en peux plus.
A vomir jour et nuit.
Tu peux pas
te dépêcher de mourir ?
Bon Dieu.
Je viens de voir
Nat Ginzburg.
Qu'est-ce qu'il veut ?
Vous savez qu'il a le SIDA.
Ouais, mais il refuse
d'aller à l'hôpital.
D'après Gloria,
il n'a plus longtemps à vivre,
mais il n'en peut plus
de lutter contre la maladie,
alors il m'a demandé
de vous demander
s'il serait possible
d'avancer la date
de son exécution.
Avancer la date
de son exécution ?
Ouais.
Personne n'a jamais demandé
à être exécuté avant l'heure.
Le tribunal a fixé
une date précise.
Il n'y a aucun précédent légal
pour pouvoir la changer.
Alors créons un précédent.
Vous m'encouragez
à faire ça
malgré votre propre position
contre la peine de mort ?
Cet homme
est mourant, Leo.
Je pense que dans ce cas particulier,
abréger sa vie serait...
une bénédiction.
C'est de l'euthanasie.
Je croyais que votre religion
était contre l'euthanasie.
Et beaucoup d'autres choses
sans que je le sois pour autant.
Ok, je vais appeler
les avocats.
Bien.
Les CRS ont cerné
Bear Moutain ce matin
après qu'on ait rapporté avoir vu
le prisonnier évadé, Miguel Alvarez.
Des recherches extensives ont été
effectuées, mais Alvarez,
qui a disparu
depuis trois semaines,
ne s'est, une fois encore,
pas laissé capturer.
Parallèlement, Mason Kossler, Juge à
la Cour Suprême, a accordé aujourd'hui
une demande inhabituelle faite
par le meurtrier condamné,
Nathaniel Ginzburg,
qui a demandé à être exécuté
deux mois avant
la date fixée par le tribunal.
L'exécution aura lieu
mardi prochain
à l'établissement pénitentiaire
d'Oswald.
La Sœur Pete
veut vous voir.
Comment vous me trouvez ?
On dirait Susan Hayward.
Bingo. C'est ce que
je voulais.
Ma Sœur, je vous suis
tellement reconnaissant
pour tout ce que
vous avez fait,
mais j'ai une autre faveur
à vous demander.
Tout ce que vous voudrez.
Mes ongles.
Je suis tellement énervé que j'arrive
pas à mettre le vernis sans trembler.
- Vous voulez bien le faire ?
- Bien sûr.
Asseyez-vous.
Ok.
Essayer de ne pas
bouger les mains.
Ok, voilà.
- Ça va ?
- Ouais, ouais.
Vous savez quoi ? Non, non.
Vous devriez vous allonger.
On finira vos ongles
plus tard, Ok ?
5h00...
J'ai rendez-vous
avec un ange.
Reposez-vous.
Ginzburg va mourir demain
parce qu'il a tué Antonio Nappa.
Ouais ?
- Tu voulais qu'il le fasse.
- Ouais.
Ça t'embête pas un peu ?
Il va mourir à cause de toi.
Non. C'est la vie
qu'on a choisi.
Bien sûr, mais, Chucky...
t'as peur de mourir ?
Non.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous avec
une cigarette, Pancamo ?
Je la fume ?
Eteins-la.
Tout de suite !
Sinon je viens.
D'elle, j'ai peur.
Il paraît que Ginzburg a choisi
la chambre à gaz.
Ça m'irait.
T'es là-dedans une minute
à inspirer et expirer,
tes poumons se remplissent.
Avant que tu t'en aperçoives
tu te rends
plus compte de rien.
- Une pipe.
- Quoi ?
Au lieu d'un dernier repas,
on devrait te tailler
une dernière pipe.
Ouais.
Ginzburg, c'est l'heure.
Ginzburg ?
Nat ?
Oh, mon Dieu.
Il est froid.
Il est mort.
Faites venir un médecin.
Allez comprendre.
Il meurt de causes naturelles
pendant son sommeil.
Il est tellement beau.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Je vais finir
de lui faire les ongles.
A l'appel !
Mobay.
Mobay, bouge ton cul.
Ouais, ouais. J'arrive.
Mobay, écoute bien.
Demain on retrouve
la forme.
La forme ?
Ça veut dire quoi ?
Ça veut dire qu'on va recevoir
une nouvelle livraison.
- Où ?
- Ça te regarde pas.
Alors, Mobay, T-Brown,
je veux que chacun de vous
m'amène cinq nouveaux bébés.
Des bébés ?
- Des nouveaux clients, mon frère.
- Des bébés. Ok.
Poet, tu supervises.
J'ai pas besoin
de supervision.
Ce dont tu as besoin
c'est d'apprendre
à recevoir des ordres.
Oui... monsieur.
Mobay.
Vous connaissez l'inspecteur
McGorry, de la Criminelle ?
- Bien sûr. Bonjour, Guinevere.
- John.
Vous êtes ici à propos
de la mort de Bruno Goergen.
Bien que ripou, Goergen
a fourni des preuves importantes
dans l'affaire
du trafic d'armes.
Le procureur est fumasse
que son témoin principal
n'ait pas survécu
une semaine à Oz.
Vous avez une idée
de qui l'a tué ?
Je pensais qu'il était tombé
de la cage d'ascenseur par accident.
Non, mon instinct
me dit le contraire.
Vous pensez
que quelqu'un a buté Goergen
parce qu'il aurait découvert
que c'était un flic ?
Non, il s'agit d'autre chose.
Je ne sais pas encore quoi.
Mobay, attends.
Je t'en prie, je t'en prie !
Si je peux vous être utile
dans votre enquête.
Ouais. Ouvrez bien vos oreilles.
Appelez-moi, au cas où.
Je vais interroger
des détenus, en commençant par
- le camarade de cellule de Goergen.
- Ok.
A bientôt.
Alors, vous êtes bien
avec Adebisi et ses types ?
Oui.
Il ont une nouvelle livraison
qui arrive demain,
mais je n'arrive pas à savoir
par quelle porte.
Ils voulaient aussi que je recrute
de nouveaux acheteurs.
En tant qu'officier de police, vous ne
pouvez pas vendre de la drogue.
Je sais.
Je vais utiliser l'argent que j'ai et
prétendre avoir trouvé mes "bébés".
- Eh, voilà ton type.
- Ok.
Je l'ai.
Je l'ai.
- T'étais où ?
- En train de recruter.
J'ai deux bébés.
- Qui ?
- Je sais pas leurs noms.
Ben montre-les-moi.
- Ils sont déjà partis.
- Merde.
Ben, donne-moi le fric.
Allez, allez, allez.
- J'ai plus de came.
- Bien.
Voilà.
Continue à vendre, baby.
Continue à vendre.
Eh, Mobay.
Arrête-toi un peu.
T'as reniflé cette merde
toute la nuit. Je veux dormir.
Alors dors.
Qu'est-ce que t'as dit ?
Rien, désolé.
Sœur Peter Marie.
Je suis content que le directeur
vous ait dit qui je suis.
J'ai besoin de parler et j'ai besoin
que ce soit confidentiel.
Bien entendu.
Oz est ma première
grosse mission secrète.
Beaucoup de mes collègues
aux stups
ne pensaient pas que je tiendrais
le coup, mais je m'en savais capable.
Je pensais que je pouvais.
J'ai laissé
mon épouse et mon fils,
je leur ai dit que je ne savais pas
combien de mois je serais parti.
Abby... mon épouse...
elle a peur, naturellement,
que je me fasse découvrir,
et que je me fasse tuer.
Aujourd'hui c'est l'anniversaire
de Robby.
Je pensais être près de démanteler
le cartel de la drogue,
mais non.
Mais il faut que je le fasse.
Si je n'y parviens pas,
ma carrière est terminée.
Je me retrouve dans le métro
à arrêter les clochards,
alors faut que je reste.
Faut que j'aille jusqu'au bout.
Mais...
mais, ma Sœur,
je suis accro.
Parfois les gens amoureux
disent qu'ils ont
"la tête à l'envers",
Mais s'ils savaient
ce que ça veut réellement dire,
je ne suis pas sûr
qu'ils le diraient.
Au mauvais vieux temps,
pour donner un avertissement
aux criminels,
des juges ordonnaient
que ceux qui n'étaient pas contents
soient pendus par les chevilles,
les talons au dessus de la tête.
L'expression fut utilisée pour décrire
un état d'impuissance,
de confusion.
Maintenant que j'y pense,
c'est bien ça être amoureux.
Qu'est-ce que je fais
si je découvre qui a tué Gary ?
Tu le butes.
Ouais ?
Ce sera avec plaisir.
Putain, qu'est-ce qui te prend ?
T'as tué mon fils !
Mon fils est mort.
Rien ne peut changer ça.
Et Keller a fait tuer Gary.
Rien ne peut
changer ça non plus.
Beecher, c'est pas en tuant Keller
que tu feras le deuil de ton fils.
Quoi, maintenant
tu défends cet enculé ?
Non. Il doit être puni.
Mais pas par toi.
Tobias,
le FI a trouvé votre fille.
Holly est en vie.
Nous avons suivi la piste
que vous nous avez donnée.
Bob "Gros Cul" Towland n'avait
rien à voir avec l'enlèvement.
On l'avait arrêté
deux jours avant
et il était au centre
de détention de Coranachil
attendant sa mise en accusation.
Mais si c'était pas lui,
ça veut dire...
que Chris Keller est innocent.
Oh, bon Dieu.
Oh, bordel de Dieu !
Nous avons arrêté
le vrai coupable ce matin.
Tobias...
C'est Hank Schillinger.
Asseyez-vous, Vern.
Nous avons à parler
de quelques petits trucs.
Ah bon ?
J'ai un dossier
plein de bagarres
entre vous deux.
Et en plus...
on m'a dit que vous aimez
vous faire baiser dans le cul.
J'apprécie pas vraiment aucune
de ces deux pratiques,
alors, Keller,
je te mets ailleurs.
Mais si l'un de vous touche l'autre
par amour ou par guerre,
je vous transfère tous les deux
à Gen-Pop. C'est compris ?
- Oui.
- Oui.
Keller, va faire tes bagages.
Beecher, j'ai autre chose
à voir avec toi.
Le directeur me dit
qu'un détenu du quartier B,
Vern Schillinger,
est peut-être responsable
de la mort de ton fils.
Alors pour l'instant
nous avons décidé,
de restreindre tes déplacements
dans le reste d'Oz.
Tu n'es plus autorisé à aller
à la bibliothèque ou à la gym,
et tu prendras
tes repas ici, à Em City.
Il a tué mon fils
et c'est moi qui suis puni ?
Tenant compte du fait
que j'ai transféré
tous les Aryens
hors d'Em City,
c'est l'endroit où tu es
le plus en sécurité.
En sécurité ?
Façon de parler.
- Chris ?
- Non. N'essaie pas.
Mon fils est mort
d'une façon horrible.
J'étais fou de chagrin.
Tu pensais vraiment que
je pourrais faire une chose pareille ?
Ordonner le meurtre
d'un enfant ?
Ton enfant ?
Ouais, t'as plein
de raisons
de penser le pire
à mon sujet.
Mais j'ai travaillé dur...
pour regagner
ta confiance,
ton amour.
Je pensais y être arrivé, mais ça,
ça prouve que non.
- Chris...
- Non, je peux pas...
- Je t'en prie.
- Jamais.
- Je t'en prie.
- Non. C'est fini.
C'est fini.
Terminé.
Chris, faut que
tu me pardonnes.
Non.
Je t'ai pardonné, moi.
Ça fait de toi
le meilleur de nous deux.
Salut.
J'suis ton nouveau voisin.
C'est mon lit.
Ça l'est plus.
Mondo...
sois sympa.
En rang pour le déjeuner !
Suis-moi.
- Les flics on arrêté Hank ?
- Ouais.
Dès qu'il a
laissé partir la fille,
les flics l'ont encerclé.
Le moment venu, si les flics
le travaillent au corps,
tu crois que ton fils
va te donner ?
Pour être tout à fait honnête,
je sais pas.
Eh, Vern.
Quatre mariages,
j'ai jamais eu de gosses, alors je sais
que dalle sur comment les élever,
mais toi, putain,
tu mérites un prix.
Un fils, tu lui donnes de la drogue,
sachant qu'il va faire une overdose.
L'autre, tu t'arranges pour qu'il ait
la peine de mort.
T'es le père de la putain d'année,
mais tu sais quoi ?
Quand tes deux fils seront morts,
ce sera fini,
parce que tu feras
plus d'enfants. Pas ici.
Alors quand tu mourras,
ton nom mourra avec toi.
Tout ce que tu es
mourra avec toi.
Et le monde
ne s'en portera que mieux.
Tiens, tiens, tiens,
qu'est-ce qu'on a ici ?
Oh, je vois.
Mon pote Keller.
Quoi de neuf, connard ?
Eh, Keller, faut que
j'te pose une question.
Ça t'embête si je baise
ta copine Beecher ?
Ça t'embête si elle
me suce la bite ?
J'ai rien à foutre de ce que tu fais
ou de ce qu'il fait.
T'as entendu ça, Leroy ?
Ouais, Mondo.
Bon, parce que on veut pas
de problèmes ici,
alors notez que j'ai
la permission de Keller
- de baiser Beecher dans le cul.
- Oui, c'est noté.
Paix.
Qu'est-il arrivé
à votre main ?
Je me souvenais
comment c'était en enfer.
Mon Père bénissez-moi
parce que j'ai péché.
L'année dernière, j'ai commis
de nombreux actes homosexuels.
Vous voulez que j'entre
dans les détails ?
Non.
Avant de venir à Oz,
j'ai couché avec
plusieurs hommes...
et ensuite je les ai butés.
Quoi ?
Après le sexe,
je les ai tués.
Pourquoi ?
Je ne voulais pas qu'ils en parlent à
quelqu'un et qu'ils donnent mon nom.
Il faut que vous alliez
vous dénoncer aux autorités.
Quoi ?
Vous ne pouvez pas m'absoudre ?
Bien sûr que je peux, mais
le seul moyen de montrer à Dieu
que vous êtes vraiment désolé
est d'avouer.
Écoutez...
Je suis vraiment désolé, Ok ? Alors
donnez-moi la putain d'absolution.
Non.
Donnez-moi ma putain
de pénitence.
Non.
Pauvre con.
Allez en putain d'enfer,
pauvre con
de garde-chiourme en noir.
Oh, non.
Allez, Beecher,
suce ma bite.
Bon Dieu,
qu'est-ce que t'es romantique.
C'est comme ça
que tu parles aux nanas ?
Quand je suis excité,
moins je parle le mieux c'est.
OK, mon Jules.
Amène-toi.
Durant des siècles,
l'humiliation faisait partie
de toute punition.
En Angleterre, ils suspendaient
un criminel dans une cage
à quelques pieds du sol
au milieu de la place publique.
Le pauvre con dégueulasse avait l'air
d'un canari dans sa cage,
d'un perroquet.
Alors on commença
à les appeler "oiseaux de prisons".
Seulement le genre de gazouillements
qu'on fait à Oz
n'est pas si mignon que ça.
- M. Morales.
- M. Rebadow.
Ma demande.
Vous aviez dit avoir besoin
d'y réfléchir.
Ah, oui.
Alors ?
Quand vous m'avez demandé
de tuer Raul Hernandez,
vous m'avez dit que je pourrais avoir
tout ce que je voulais en place.
Et maintenant vous voulez que je vous
laisse tuer quelqu'un d'autre.
Oui.
Curieusement,
il n'y a personne dont j'ai besoin
de me débarrasser à l'heure actuelle.
De plus...
en tant que nouveau membre du
conseil, j'ai promis à Querns
qu'il n'y aura pas de violence
à Emerald City.
Vous revenez
sur votre parole.
Demandez quelque chose d'autre.
Des cigarettes, de l'argent,
de la drogue.
Je veux tuer quelqu'un.
Si vous êtes décidé, pourquoi
demander ma permission ?
Pas votre permission,
votre protection.
Ça vous pouvez l'avoir.
Peu importe qui je tue ?
Vous allez pas faire quelque chose
de dingue, n'est-ce pas ?
Comme buter Pancamo ?
Certainement pas.
Alors qui vous allez tuer ?
C'est là la question.
Je peux me joindre à toi ?
Je peux me joindre
à toi, Busmalis ?
Tu me parles ?
Tu dis vraiment des mots
destinés à mes oreilles ?
Oui.
Je t'ai mal traité
et je suis désolé.
Tu veux dire
que tout est pardonné ?
C'est vrai.
Tout est pardonné.
Tu veux ma tarte ?
Oui.
Oui !
Je suis fatigué,
mais heureux.
Tu me parles à nouveau.
Au dîner, le poulet
était mangeable.
Tout l'un dans l'autre,
la vie est belle.
Je suis le plus heureux
des hommes.
Extinction des feux !
Je suis en train de lire
"L'Art de la Guerre" par Sun Tzu.
C'est fascinant.
L'instinct meurtrier
est aussi commun
que le besoin de procréer.
Nous autres à Oz , c'est nous
qui sommes normaux en réalité.
Nous suivons
l'appel de la nature.
C'est drôle, hein, Busmalis ?
Busmalis ?
Bon Dieu !
Au secours !
Ça va pas ?
- Enlevez-le de moi !
- Putain de bon Dieu.
Il essaie de me tuer.
Bon Dieu !
Il m'a coupé !
Donne-moi ça !
Tu vas faire du putain de trou.
- Tout va bien.
- Pourquoi il a fait ça bordel ?
Merde ! Bon sang,
j'suis tout coupé là en haut.
Eddie.
Eh. Ouais.
Non, c'est moi.
C'est pour ça
que j'appelle.
Ouais.
C'est ça.
Tu t'en occupes
d'ici la semaine prochaine ?
Bien. Pas plus tard que
la semaine prochaine, d'accord ?
Ok. Bien.
A bientôt.
- Tu m'as fait appeler ?
- Vous avez mis Hoyt en isolement ?
Non.
- Il a essayé de me tuer.
- Je sais.
Mais pour l'instant ni lui ni toi
ne voulez me dire pourquoi.
C'est personnel.
Très bien.
Tu demandes d'être
mis sous protection,
je t'envoie ici.
Mais tôt ou tard,
je te ramène,
et Hoyt ou l'un
de ses copains motards
va finir le travail.
Alors vas-y,
garde ça pour toi.
Attendez !
Je vais vous dire.
Tout.
Galino avait un portable.
Après sa mort,
je l'ai récupéré.
Maintenant c'est O'Reily qui l'a.
Il l'a caché quelque part
à Em City.
Il est où ?
Le portable.
Quel... quel portable,
M. Querns ?
Tu sais quel portable.
C'est interdit, monsieur.
- Vous ne l'avez pas trouvé ?
- Non.
Et sans ce portable,
je n'ai aucun moyen
- de prouver que ton histoire est vraie.
- Qu'est-ce qui va m'arriver ?
Je te laisse ici
deux jours de plus,
puis je te renvoie.
Mourir.
D'accord, M. Querns,
j'ai deux requêtes.
J'aimerais voir
ma copine
et un rabbin.
Je vais arranger ça.
Je vais très probablement
bientôt mourir.
- Nikolai.
- Faut que tu fasses un truc pour moi.
Tout ce que tu veux.
Ce soir à 17h00,
je veux que tu appelles ce numéro.
Faut que ce soit
exactement à 17h00.
Dans l'un des fiers moments
de mon mandat de gouverneur
j'ai signé pour rétablir
la peine de mort.
Ensemble, nous avons fait
de grands pas en avant
dans la guerre contre le crime,
mais il reste beaucoup à faire.
Finissons le travail.
Le courage de diriger :
Votez James Devlin pour gouverneur.
Il y a très longtemps...
si un homme volait la vache
d'un autre homme
ou un agneau ou un cochon
et le tuait,
et qu'on le trouvait
avec le sang de l'animal
sur les mains,
on disait qu'on l'avait coincé
"les mains rouges".
Bien entendu, si le voleur était
trop malin pour se laver les mains,
il méritait peut-être
de se faire attraper.
A l'appel !
Merde.
Putain.
Je n'ai jamais touché le portable.
Il ne m'a jamais
laissé le toucher.
- J'ai pas tué Galino.
- C'est Stanislofsky.
C'est sa parole
contre la mienne.
J'ai cinq types
qui vont le confirmer.
Je veux que Stanislofsky soit mort.
Sous protection ?
Impossible.
Je croyais que t'avais de l'influence
dans ce trou.
Désolé, O'Reily.
Ton frère,
il dort toute la journée ?
Non, ils lui ont donné
un nouveau traitement
pour le calmer.
A mon avis,
il est trop calme.
Cyril.
Cyril ?
Cyril, réveille-toi.
Cyril !
Cyril, réveille-toi !
Cyril, réveille-toi, putain !
Cyril !
Putain !
Smith, y'a quelque chose
qui va pas avec mon frère.
- Ç'est à dire ?
- Je sais pas. Faites vite.
Appelez un putain
de médecin. Allez.
Poste central, ici numéro 16.
Nous avons un possible code quatre.
Mettons-le sous deux grosses
perfusions de sérum.
- Il va falloir l'entuber.
- Que s'est-il passé ?
Il a fait une overdose
de Haldol.
- O'Reily ?
- Quoi ?
- T'as des nouvelles de ton frère ?
- Non.
Ces putains de garde-chiourmes,
ils me disent d'attendre ici
et j'attends ici, et rien.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe
là-bas dedans ?
Il va s'en sortir.
Tu sais, c'est elle
qui a fait ça.
Cette putain
de docteur Nathan.
Elle lui donne
trop de drogues exprès.
C'est sa façon
de se venger de moi.
Je ne crois pas
qu'elle en soit capable.
Eh, Gloria me déteste.
Réveille-toi.
Elle croit que j'ai embauché Keenan
pour la violer.
Maintenant elle a mon frère
entre ses griffes,
et y'a pas une putain de chose
que je puisse y faire.
Je putain de déteste
cet endroit !
Putain !
Cyril !
Gloria.
Comment va Cyril ?
Il a eu un lavage d'estomac.
Il respire normalement.
Le problème c'est qu'on ne sait pas
s'il a été inconscient longtemps
avant qu'ils l'amènent, donc les
prochaines heures sont critiques,
mais je pense
qu'il va s'en sortir.
Qu'est-ce que ça vous fait ?
- On est en thérapie tout à coup ?
- Non.
Je veux juste être sûre qu'il reçoive
les meilleurs soins possibles.
Oh, et vous ne pensez pas que je sois
capable de distinguer
mes obligations professionnelles
de ma colère ?
Je pense que pour l'instant
vous êtes tellement confuse
que vous ne savez plus
où vous en êtes.
- J'ai d'autres patients...
- Gloria.
Ryan O'Reily n'a pas embauché
cet homme pour vous violer.
Il a admis l'avoir fait.
Il vous a dit
ce que vous vouliez entendre.
Keenan m'a violée
à cause de O'Reily.
Il vous a agressée
par hasard.
Si Keenan
ne vous avait pas violée,
il aurait violé
quelqu'un d'autre.
- Salut, Keenan.
- Salut.
Eh, le porte chance
de l'irlandais, hein ?
- Ouais.
- Bien.
J'veux que tu fasses
quelque chose pour moi.
Tout ce que tu veux.
Je veux que tu me racontes.
Quoi ?
Quand t'as violé
le docteur Nathan,
j'veux savoir comment
c'était de la baiser.
Ok.
Elle entrait
dans son appartement,
l'air tellement sexy.
Ouais.
Comment ça va ?
J'ai mal à la tête.
Ça va s'arrêter.
Où est Ryan ?
Je sais pas.
Probablement à Em City.
Et puis j'ai forcé
ma bite en elle.
Je l'ai enculée.
Vous ne nous aimez pas,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je vous aime bien.
Jusqu'à ce qu'elle
ne puisse plus crier.
Elle pouvait plus respirer.
Mon frère...
il fait des choses
pas bien,
mais au fond
il n'est pas mauvais.
J'ai éjaculé en elle
et elle gémissait.
Il vous aime.
De tout son cœur.
Bon Dieu.
T'a vraiment
mis le paquet avec elle.
Oh, ouais.
Ouais.
Alors tu dis que tu veux
travailler pour moi ?
Absolument.
Je procède autrement ici,
que quand on travaillait
dans la rue.
Par exemple, quand je veux
quelqu'un mort,
je ne le bute
jamais moi-même.
Je pousse toujours quelqu'un
d'autre à le faire pour moi.
Je leur fais croire que la personne
que je veux morte est leur ennemi.
Comme ça, je peux pas
être associé au meurtre.
C'est tellement cool.
T'as quoi,
sept ans fermes à faire ?
Tu crois que tu vas tenir
jusque là ?
- Bien sûr. Je vais sortir.
- Ouais. C'est bien.
Continue à y croire, Patrick.
Tu sais quand je t'ai dit
que je trouve toujours
- quelqu'un pour tuer pour moi ?
- Ouais.
Et bien...
dans ton cas, j'vais faire
une exception.
Descendez-le
à la morgue.
Mon seul vrai souvenir
de cette nuit là était ce trèfle.
Je me souviens que la lumière
de la lampe de rue s'y reflétait.
Quand Keenan est arrivé
aux urgences, j'ai pensé,
C'est bien.
Il est mort.
C'est bien.
Vous aviez raison.
Je suis revenue trop tôt.
Il faut que je prenne
un congé.
Juste pour remettre
ma colère
à la bonne place.
Peut-être qu'alors je pourrai
apprendre à pardonner.
Moi-même plus que quiconque.
Votre poste sera encore là
quand vous déciderez
de revenir.
Si je reviens, Leo.
"Sceller son destin".
Il y a des années, la peine de mort
ne pouvait être appliquée
que si la sentence de mort portait
le sceau officiel du juge
au bas de la page.
Imaginez...
la seule chose qui se mette
entre vous et la mort
est un petit morceau
de cire fondue.
Mais c'est ça la vie.
Les gros changements
interviennent tous à cause
de petits morceaux de cire.
Un gros flambeur
a dit une fois,
"L'activité principale de l'Amérique,
ce sont les affaires".
Et je suis heureux d'annoncer
que les affaires pénales
sont en plein essor.
L'industrie lourde
s'est déplacée au sud,
les petites villes luttent
pour décrocher des contrats
pour la construction
d'établissements pénitentiaires.
Qui l'eut cru ?
Des bon citoyens qui supplient
pour avoir des violeurs,
des dealers de drogue et des assassins
tout près de chez eux.
Comment va ton frère ?
Le médecin dit qu'il s'est complètement
remis de son overdose.
Ils vont le garder en observation
à l'hôpital jusqu'à demain,
mais Cyril va s'en sortir.
Dieu soit loué.
Eh, O'Reily,
désolé pour ta copine.
C'est qui sa copine, Adebisi ?
Le docteur Nathan. Ouais, elle a pris
un congé exceptionnel.
Elle a failli s'étrangler quand Ryan
lui a tiré un coup dans la bouche.
Va te faire enculer !
- Vas-y frappe !
- Va te faire foutre !
Pourquoi ces putains
de menottes ? J'ai pas commencé !
Ferme ta putain
de gueule, O'Reily !
Mords-moi, bon sang de clito !
J'prends celui-là.
Va te faire foutre !
- T'es pas fou ?
- Bordel ! Putain !
A terre.
Reste à terre bordel !
Taille-moi une pipe.
- Encore ?
- Ouais.
Oh, putain !
Rabbin.
Alors, ça va mieux ?
Un homme mort a besoin
de considérer toutes ses options.
Tu es sûr d'être
un homme mort ?
M. Querns,
un jour, peut-être une semaine
après que vous m'ayez
renvoyé à Em City,
O'Reily aura trouvé
un moyen pour me tuer.
Je t'aime bien, Stanislofsky.
Je sais pas pourquoi,
mais c'est vrai.
Je peux te laisser rester ici
quelques jours de plus.
A quoi bon ?
- La mort est inévitable.
- Pas nécessairement.
J'ai l'intention d'avoir une petite
discussion avec ton copain, O'Reily.
Tu sais...
J'essaie d'éliminer
la violence à Em City.
Et vous faites
un super travail, monsieur.
Arrête tes conneries !
Quand Stanislofsky va revenir,
si quoi que ce soit lui arrive...
la moindre chose...
s'il se coupe en se rasant,
je te tiendrai responsable.
C'est Hoyt qui a une dent
contre lui, pas moi.
Je m'en moque.
Tu es responsable.
Compris ?
S'il arrive quelque chose à Nikolai
quand il revient à Em City,
- je l'ai dans le cul.
- C'est ça. Maintenant tire-toi.
- Claire ? Baby ?
- Ouais ? Ouais ?
- Tu m'aimes comment ?
- Oh, beaucoup.
Ouais ? Assez pour faire
tout ce que je demande ?
- Ouais.
- Ça c'est une bonne fille. Allez.
Cyril ! Eh !
Comment ça va ?
Ça va bien ?
Tu te sens mieux ?
- Oui.
- Bon.
O'Reily ?
La personne sur laquelle
tu voulais des infos ?
- Ouais.
- Il revient à Em City demain.
Reste là.
Merde.
Écoute ça. Il a demandé
une faveur à Querns.
- Quoi ?
- Il veut prendre un bain.
- Y'a pas de baignoires à Oz.
- Salle de rééducation de l'hôpital.
C'est parfait.
Tu sais quoi faire,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je viens chercher Stanislofsky.
Merci.
T'as fini ?
Cinq minutes, s'il vous plait.
Je m'amuse bien.
Je parie que je peux t'aider
à t'amuser encore mieux.
Ah, c'est bon.
Ça te va ?
C'était pas
comme ça au Goulag.
Tous pareils, vous les hommes.
Si rapides, si facilement satisfaits.
La plupart d'entre vous ignorent
comment satisfaire une femme.
- Ryan O'Reily, lui il sait.
- Oh, vraiment ?
Voici un petit gage
de son affection.
C'est quoi ?
Un canard en plastique.
Un canard en plastique ?
Appelle le toubib. Je crois
que le russe est mort.
Eh, M. Querns,
j'ai appris pour Stanislofsky.
C'est bizarre. Le type meurt
avant de revenir à Em City.
Ouais.
Picasso, écrase-toi.
Eh, Miles, livraison spéciale.
De la peinture, putain merci.
J'en ai presque plus.
- Ça progresse bien.
- Bien ?
C'est un chef d'œuvre
d'art du 21ème siècle.
Ce mur devrait être au Louvre.
Eh, la prochaine fois essaie
de me les donner dans la main.
- Va te faire foutre.
- Déjeuner.
- Eh, c'est quoi, Leroy ?
- Poulet panné.
Encore ? Vous savez rien faire
d'autre vous les nègres ?
Faut suivre les directives
diététiques d'État, mon pote.
Attention.
T'as renversé ma bouffe.
Va te faire foutre.
- C'est l'heure d'y aller, Deyell.
- Y aller ?
- Il va où ?
- Rendez-vous avec son avocat.
T'essaie encore de faire appel de
ta peine de mort, Blanche Neige ?
Va te faire enculer, salope !
Ils vont jamais te gracier.
Personne te demande
ton avis, trou du cul.
Ouais, Miles,
ferme-la un peu. Ok ?
Le juge Fee a rejeté
notre appel.
Merde. merde.
Merde, merde, merde !
- Y'a un problème ?
- Non, M. l'agent. Tout va bien.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
On va en cour suprême
et on fait appel
de la décision de la cour d'appel.
Ça va prendre
combien de temps ?
Connaissant le nombre actuel
de dossiers devant la cour,
- je dirai au moins un an.
- Un an ?
J'peux pas faire un jour de plus dans le
couloir de la mort et surtout pas un an !
J'ai pas inventé
ce système, Moïse.
Je fais juste avec.
Vous pouvez pas
accélérer le procédé ?
Je ne sais même pas s'ils vont
examiner notre dossier.
Le Juge Ginther, qui a été nommé
à la Cour Suprême par James Devlin,
a tendance a faire la sourde oreille
pour tout ce qu'il considère
"laxiste en matière criminelle".
Alors je suis de la baise ?
Je dis juste que le temps
est peut-être de notre côté.
D'après la rumeur,
Ginther a un cancer de la prostate.
S'il meurt ou se retire, son remplaçant
peut voir la peine de mort autrement.
- Et en attendant ?
- Vous vivez un an de plus.
Tirez le meilleur
d'une mauvaise situation.
Eh, tu sais comment je t'appelle
toujours "Blanche Neige" ?
Pendant que t'étais en bas
avec ton toutou d'avocat,
j'ai pensé "Merde,
y'a tout un tas d'autres noms
que j'peux utiliser.
Nègre, bien entendu,
ou sale nègre,
chocolat noir,
tireur de lances, black beauty,
bougnoule".
Mais je me suis décidé
pour négro.
Négro !
Ça a une sorte de simplicité.
Ça veut dire un noir
en espagnol. Un négro.
Négro.
Négro. Négro !
Négro ! Négro !
Négro, négro, négro !
Idiot ! Enlève-toi de là. Idiot !
Tu fais comme ça, plus vite !
Tu vois ça ?
Bouge-toi maintenant.
Espèce de bébé.
Prisonnier numéro 96Z858,
Éli Zabitz.
Condamné le 1er avril 1996,
pour coups et blessures.
Sentence : neuf ans de prison,
dont six fermes.
- Zabitz.
- Oh, Keller.
- Non, non. Où tu vas ?
- Où tu peux pas aller pour moi.
Non, faut que tu sois
ici, avec moi.
Ouais, ouais, Ok.
Ça va les dents de ta fille ?
Je suis fier de dire qu'elles sont
comme des perles maintenant.
Tant mieux.
Je suis content
que tu puisse lui fournir
des soins dentaires avant de mourir.
Mourir ? Je ne...
Mon Dieu, Keller !
Assieds-toi et ferme
ta putain de gueule.
Tu as dit à Tobias Beecher
que j'avais tué son gamin.
C'est Schillinger qui m'y a forcé.
Peu importe...
bientôt tu iras rejoindre tes ancêtres.
Si tu as l'intention de le faire...
pourquoi me le dire ?
Pour que tu puisses
mettre tes affaires en ordre...
et pour te regarder transpirer.
Tu m'écoutes ?
Keller dit
qu'il va me buter.
Tu peux pas me lâcher
les baskets ?
Tu m'empêches
de me concentrer.
Écoute, il faut
que tu me protèges,
parce que sinon, je vais voir
les garde-chiourmes
et je leur dis que tu m'a payé
pour mentir à Beecher.
Baisse d'un ton.
Tu vois ce que tu m'a fait faire ?
Tu fais foirer ma partie.
Ta partie ?
C'est de ma vie qu'on parle !
Écoute, je t'ai dit
que je te protégerais.
J'vais te protéger. Ok ?
- Ok.
- Maintenant tire-toi !
Nom de Dieu, je croyais que les juifs
étaient sensés être durs.
Seulement les israéliens.
Tue le.
Je vais refaire un essai.
Salut, Éli.
Tu sais, t'es pas vraiment
en sécurité dans cette pièce.
Je me suis fait
poignarder ici une fois.
Putain, Keller, non !
Oh, Dieu merci.
Attrape-le.
- Schillinger te veut mort.
- Quoi ? Bordel de merde !
- Robson, il est à moi.
- Va te faire voir.
J'vous en prie !
Ne me tuez pas !
J'vous en prie !
Putain !
- A plus.
- A plus.
- Il est mort ?
- Crise cardiaque.
Nom de Dieu.
Je lui avais dit, "Pas tant
de viandes rouges".
Beecher !
A plus tard.
Tu as été accro
avec l'alcool,
puis l'héroïne.
Mais ça,
c'est le pire
et le plus dangereux.
Toby,
je te parle.
Oh, j'aime ça
quand t'es rude.
T'es une pute, Beecher.
Tu coucherais avec n'importe qui.
Et alors ?
Qu'est-ce que ça te fait ce sexe ?
Tu te sens mieux dans ta peau ?
Non, pire.
Alors pourquoi le faire ?
Parce que au moins
je ressens quelque chose.
Je préfèrerais être heureux,
mais faute de ça, je me contente
de me détester.
Ne te déteste pas.
Pourquoi pas ?
Mon fils est mort
à cause de moi.
Ma fille est complètement
déglinguée à cause de moi.
Et Keller...
Il ne m'aime pas.
Mais j'ai essayé
cette nouvelle lessive.
Elle a l'air de bien
laver le blanc.
Bonjour, Chris.
Je veux vous parler de Beecher.
J'ai droit à une demi-heure à la gym.
Vous prenez sur mon temps.
Vous voulez bien
me laisser finir ?
Cet homme est en train
de mourir à l'intérieur.
C'est pas ma faute.
Je ne vous accuse pas.
Je vous demande de l'aider.
Vous avez eu
une relation tous les deux.
Une relation intime.
Oh, allons, mon Père,
vous pouvez le dire.
On s'est tringlés dans le cul,
- dans la bouche.
- Je parle pas de la baise.
L'amour. Vous vous aimiez
tous les deux.
Je sais que c'est fini.
Mais tout de même,
si tu vous avez eu
de vrais sentiments pour lui,
je peux pas croire que vous regardiez
ce qui se passe sans rien faire.
Il a essayé de me tuer.
Tu as tué mon fils !
Et ma relation avec Beecher...
elle a commencé dans la brutalité et
c'est comme ça qu'elle a fini.
L'amour était insignifiant.
Je ne crois pas vraiment
que vous pensiez ça.
Non ?
Vous habitez où, mon Père ?
Vous habitez où ?
Dans un Presbytère,
à St. Margaret.
Y'a que des hommes là,
n'est-ce pas ?
Ouais.
Vous avez des expériences communes,
une foi commune.
Vous acceptez les excentricités
et les défauts les uns des autres.
Certains sont inacceptables,
comme par exemple,
un prêtre qui veut
en baiser un autre.
- Oh, Keller...
- Vous m'avez dit de vous laisser finir.
Je vous demande juste
de me rendre la politesse.
Ok.
A moins que, je sois
trop près de la vérité.
- Vous l'avez jamais fait, n'est-ce pas ?
- Quoi ?
- Baisé un autre prêtre.
- Non.
- Jamais voulu le faire ?
- Non.
Oh, allons. Vous partagez
la salle de bain.
Vous entrez et le p'tit cul ferme d'un
séminariste se ballade sous votre nez.
Je vois où vous voulez en venir.
Vous voulez que je fasse
une bonne action,
quelque chose de désintéressé.
Disons que j'aide Beecher.
Eh, Mukada,
on est à Oz.
Et comme je le disais,
y'a des règles différentes ici.
D'après la règle ici,
je suis pas sensé
sauver Beecher.
Putain, je respecterais pas
la règle si je le faisais.
Il suffit d'un homme
pour changer les choses.
Ouais ?
Ben c'est pas moi.
Sept détenus sur 10
viennent de la ville,
mais 90% des prisons
elles-mêmes
sont dans des zones rurales.
Vous savez, des terres cultivées,
des coteaux, des forêts.
On pourrait penser qu'un
environnement aussi bucolique
aurait un effet calmant
sur ceux à l'intérieur.
Mais non,
dans la nature,
tout devient encore plus sauvage.
Tobias, nous avons
de mauvaises nouvelles.
Mauvaises nouvelles ?
Ben ça change.
Hank Schillinger a été lavé
des accusations de meurtre
et enlèvement.
Quoi ?
- Vous voulez dire qu'il est libre ?
- Oui.
Apparemment, quand il a été arrêté,
la police n'a pas fait ce qu'elle
était supposée faire
et le juge a acquitté Hank.
- Sur une erreur de procédure ?
- Ouais.
Qu'est-ce qui va se passer ?
Rien. On ne peut rien faire.
Ok.
Vous n'allez pas rester
pour en parler ?
S'il n'y a rien à faire,
de quoi voulez-vous parler ?
De votre colère.
Ma sœur, vous ne voulez pas
voir ma colère.
Ma colère est massive,
elle se répand sur tout.
Je n'ai pas peur.
Bien.
Vous étiez où, bordel,
pendant toute cette merde ?
- Tobias.
- Quoi ?
Laissez-le parler.
Je croyais que les autres vous
importaient vraiment, mais seulement
si ça vient pas déranger
vos propres putains de conneries.
Vous n'êtes rien d'autre
qu'une sale pute égoïste.
J'peux partir maintenant ?
Oui, mais pensez
à quelque chose.
Il n'y a qu'une personne qui compte
vraiment dans tout ça,
et c'est votre fille, Holly.
Elle a besoin que vous soyez fort !
Elle a besoin de son père !
Comment tu t'appelles ?
Hank.
Yo, Papa.
"Yo" ?
C'est quoi ce langage ?
Je chiais dans mon froc.
J'croyais que les flics
me tenaient par les couilles.
Ils ne te peuvent rien te faire,
mon fils.
T'as encore de l'argent ?
Je pensais aller à Miami.
Tu veux quitter la ville ?
Pour un temps.
J'espérais qu'on passerait
du temps ensemble.
Ben, ouais.
Quand je reviendrai
on jouera au papa et au fiston.
Qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
Tu peux me donner
encore de l'argent ?
Bien sûr,
tout ce qu'il te faut.
Cool. Cool.
J'ai obtenu du directeur que
vous ayez des visites régulières
avec votre fille.
Nous avons parlé avec vos parents
et ils ont accepté
d'amener Holly ici
trois fois par semaine :
deux fois après l'école
et les samedis.
Vous et elle avez besoin
de temps ensemble.
Vous avez besoin de temps
pour guérir.
Courrier.
Arrêtez-les !
J'vais te tuer, enfoiré !
Je suppose que tu connais
la bonne nouvelle pour Hank.
Enculé !
Putain d'enculé !
- Emmenez-le à Em City !
- Tu vas voir !
Tu vas putain de voir !
Ouah.
Quel mauvais caractère !
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
J'aimerais bavarder
avec M. Pancamo.
Bavarder ?
J'vais voir
s'il est d'humeur à bavarder.
Belle chemise.
Tu peux entrer.
M. Pancamo,
merci de me recevoir.
Je dois admettre
que je suis intrigué.
Toi et moi on vient
pas vraiment du même patelin.
J'ai besoin que vous organisiez
quelque chose.
- De la drogue ?
- Non.
Deux de mes enfants
ont été enlevés.
Mon fils, Gary, a été tué.
Ouais, j'en ai entendu parler.
C'es le fils de Schillinger,
Hank, qui l'a fait,
mais ce salaud a été acquitté
sur une erreur de procédure.
C'est dégoûtant.
Il est en liberté
et mon fils est en train
de pourrir sous terre.
Je veux Schillinger mort.
Attends.
Attends.
Tu veux que
j'organise ça ?
Oui.
Qu'est-ce qui me prouve que c'est pas
une espèce de piège ?
Que tu travailles pas avec les garde-
chiourmes pour que je me fasse avoir ?
Ma seule preuve c'est ça.
Pendant que vous
vous occuperez de Hank,
j'vais tuer son père.
Ok. Marché conclu.
Mille pour moi,
mille pour le travail.
- Comptant.
- Ok.
Eh.
Tu vas voir ta fille ?
Ouais.
Première fois
depuis l'enlèvement.
Ça va lui faire du bien,
et à toi aussi.
Écoute, je t'ai vu parler
avec Pancamo.
- Tu m'as vu avec Pancamo ?
- Ouais.
Pas besoin d'être très fin pour
comprendre ce qui se trame.
Tu vas faire tuer
Hank Schillinger, n'est-ce pas ?
Quoi, tu vas pas le nier ?
Tu sais, tu as tué Andrew,
le fils de Schillinger.
Il a tué Gary, ton fils. Maintenant
tu veux tuer Hank ?
Ça va s'arrêter quand
cette folie ?
Après que j'aie tué Schillinger.
Tu vas te retrouver
avec une condamnation à mort.
Et qu'est-ce que ça fera de bon
pour ta fille alors ?
Pas pire que maintenant.
Holly ?
Oh, ma chérie. Ça va ?
Je suis tellement content de te voir.
Ma belle.
J'aime ma fille.
- Je le sais.
- Je veux le meilleur pour elle.
Bien sûr.
Elle ne devrait pas avoir à supporter
le fardeau de mes erreurs.
- Excusez-moi, M. Pancamo.
- Eh, Beecher.
Merci pour le paiement rapide.
J'aimerais bien que d'autres
suivent ton exemple.
Écoutez, j'ai réfléchi
et j'ai changé d'avis.
Je veux annuler le meurtre
de Hank Schillinger.
Pas de problème,
sauf pour un petit détail.
C'est trop tard.
Il est mort ?
Une balle dans la cervelle.
Oh, merde.
Mais ne t'inquiète pas.
Ils trouveront
jamais le corps,
pas en un million d'années.
Hank Schillinger
a tout bonnement disparu.
C'est le moment
de rentrer, Rebadow.
Depuis que j'ai repris la direction du
quartier, la violence a diminué de 92%.
92% !
Ce pourcentage serait plus élevé
si ce n'était pour toi,
essayant de planter Busmalis
au milieu de la nuit.
Je suis très désolé, Monsieur.
Et je vous assure que rien de tel
ne se reproduira.
Bien. Parce que
si ça arrive,
je t'envoie à Gen Pop,
où ils te boufferont
le cul pour le repas de midi.
Barre-toi.
- Ça va mieux ?
- Eh, assassin.
- Eh, assassin.
- Attention, chien méchant.
T'as parlé à Dieu récemment ?
Fais gaffe à Busmalis.
Si tu t'approches,
je suis prêt à me battre.
Non, non, non.
Je m'excuse, Agamemnon.
Je ne sais pas
ce qui m'a pris.
C'était comme si j'étais
possédé ou quelque chose
comme ça.
Je te demande pardon.
Bien...
Je t'en prie !
Stop !
Stop !
Arrêtez de parler !
Je vous en prie !
M. Querns, les médecins ont trouvé
ce qui ne va pas chez Rebadow ?
Tumeur au cerveau.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Ils l'envoient à Dennsley Memorial
pour l'opérer en urgence.
Je peux le voir
avant qu'il parte ?
Non.
Il voulait que
je lui serre la main.
Je ne l'ai pas fait.
S'il vous plait, je peux le voir ?
Non.
Nous venons chercher
Robert Rebadow.
Là-bas.
Eh, arrêtez.
Laissez-moi tranquille.
- Laissez-moi tranquille !
- Relax, Pépé.
Je veux que quelqu'un
que je connais vienne avec moi.
A trois.
Un, deux, trois.
Je ne vous connais pas.
Docteur Nathan.
Docteur Nathan !
Busmalis !
Busmalis !
Maman !
Maman !
Maman !
Le bureau de recensement
compte les prisonniers
juste comme
tout le monde.
Mais le bureau de recensement
les considère comme résidants
de la municipalité
où la prison est située,
pas de là où ils vivaient
avant d'être condamnés.
Vous dites "Et alors".
L'État se base là-dessus pour
déterminer où l'aide financière,
telle que l'aide aux démunis,
va être distribuée.
Une ville minable dans le nord
reçoit un bon gros chèque,
alors que les quartiers défavorisés
où cet argent empêcherait
la criminalité
ne reçoivent que dalle.
Le recensement
n'a aucun sens.
Vous vouliez me voir ?
Ouais, Adebisi
nous fait chier
- avec ton copain Mobay.
- Je l'aime pas.
Mobay a réalisé son quota.
Il a amené cinq nouveaux clients.
- Fous-lui la paix.
- Quels clients ?
Écoute, Tidd et Browne,
ils nous ont donné des noms.
Mobay, il les connaît
seulement de vue.
Tu l'as vraiment vu
vendre à quelqu'un ?
Non, non.
On a le fric.
Qu'est-ce que ça fait ?
Ça pourrait être un agent secret.
Avec toute la merde
qu'il s'envoie dans le nez,
aucune putain de chance.
La prochaine fois où il vend,
j'veux que tu sois
tout près de lui.
Tout près de lui !
Bien.
Ouais.
C'est une donne de merde.
Ils insistent pour me regarder vendre
la drogue à quelqu'un.
Légalement je ne peux pas.
Alors, je suis baisé.
A moins que...
Appelez votre capitaine.
Dites-lui d'amener
un autre agent secret.
Vous vendez la drogue
à un autre flic,
pas de mal de fait.
Directeur, c'est une idée de génie.
Si je suis un tel génie, pourquoi
j'arrive pas à choisir une affiche ?
Y'en a pas une
qui me ressemble.
Tu vois, je t'ai dit
que Mobay était OK.
Bruno Goergen est tombé
d'une cage d'ascenseur.
Ouais, un accident bête.
Non, on l'a poussé.
Attends, Mobay.
Je t'en prie.
Vraiment ?
Je suis ici pour découvrir
qui l'a assassiné.
- Vous avez des suggestions ?
- Non.
Vous n'avez jamais vu Goergen
se quereller avec qui que ce soit ?
Non.
Et vous n'avez jamais eu
de problèmes avec lui non plus ?
Non.
Vous voyez, c'est pas
ce qu'on m'a dit.
Écoutez, Madame, vous pouvez
continuer à creuser,
mais y'a pas de secrets
enterrés dans mon cerveau.
Je reviens.
- Quelque chose ?
- Celui-ci sait quelque chose.
J'vais le laisser seul ici
pendant un moment,
et on verra ce qui se passe.
T'étais où ?
Avec un inspecteur de police
à éviter ses questions.
Relax. Elle sait rien.
T'as aucun remord
pour ce que t'as fait, hein ?
Remord ?
Toi et moi,
on est pareils.
Des tueurs de flics.
Sauf que chaque jour,
j'aimerais pouvoir reprendre
ce que j'ai fait.
Goergen était un monstre.
Ouais, faut un monstre
pour en tuer un autre, pas vrai ?
Je suppose que oui.
Paix, homme noir.
Tu me souhaites la paix ?
- Enlève-toi de mon chemin.
- Tu vas nulle part.
T'es allé demander à Adebisi
de me faire du mal.
C'est une façon
pour un frère noir
de se comporter
avec un autre de ses frères ?
Pousse-toi.
Je pourrais te tuer.
Mais tu le feras pas parce que
Adebisi a promis à Querns
qu'il n'y aurait
pas de violence à Em City.
- Pousse-toi.
- Ok, Arif.
Mais fais attention
où tu marches.
Tu voudrais pas
que quelque chose
te tombe dessus du ciel,
n'est-ce pas ?
Bien, tout le monde.
Allons-y !
Tu veux quelque chose ?
Oui.
Imam,
j'ai gravement péché.
Je ne suis plus l'Imam.
J'ai mal agi,
je me suis déshonoré,
ainsi que notre foi.
Et à cause de mon ignorance,
nous sommes tous en danger.
Je sais.
Guide-nous, Kareem.
Non.
Arrête de te cacher
qui tu es.
Arrête de te cacher
de qui Dieu veut que tu sois.
Je te le demande
au nom d'Allah.
Guide-nous.
- Oh, Miss Sally.
- Miss Sally, je vous aime.
Votre attention !
Les prisonniers suivants
sont transférés au quartier B :
94D696, Downing :
98M922, Masters :
96Z506, Zonioni.
Prenez vos affaires,
suivez l'agent Howell.
Allez, mesdames !
Encore des types blancs
qui quittent Em City ?
Ils sont blancs,
mais c'est pas des types.
N'empêche qu'il fait
de plus en plus sombre ici.
C'est vrai.
Détenu numéro 00B563,
Raymond Browne.
Alias, "Mondo" Browne,
condamné le 10 avril 2000
pour assassinat.
Sentence : 27 ans de prison,
dont 11 fermes.
- Va te faire foutre.
- Va te faire enculer, sale nègre.
Qu'est-ce que
tu veux foutre ?
- Je suis patient, je vais attendre.
- Emmenez Zanghi au trou.
Quoi ? Il n'a rien foutu.
Vous le savez !
Je l'ai entendu dire sale nègre.
Il a provoqué Browne.
- C'est des conneries !
- Recule, Pancamo.
Allez tous vous faire foutre.
Bon ça suffit.
Arrêtez !
Browne, sors de là !
Allez, arrêtez.
Ouais !
Vas-y, baby.
Doucement, doucement.
Embrasse mon pied.
Embrasse-le.
Salut, les garçons.
- Faut qu'on parle.
- Alors parle.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
On est tes associés.
Tu crois que
tu vas nous baiser
et qu'on va se laisser faire ?
Morales, personne
ne s'intéresse à ton cul.
Johnson me frappe
avec son putain de bâton,
il envoie Zanghi au trou.
C'est pas notre putain de marché.
En plus on a pas vu de billets verts
depuis 10 jours.
Tu empoches les bénefs ?
Non, y'en a plein.
Mais y'a eu un changement
dans l'organisation.
Comment ça ?
Ben, tu sais, nous trois
on était associés
et maintenant on l'est plus.
- Quoi ?
- J'ai plus besoin de vous.
Tu veux déclancher
une guerre ?
S'il y avait une guerre,
vous perdriez.
Regarde autour de toi.
Tu vois tous ces visages ?
Les mêmes que le mien.
Non, les garçons,
y'aura pas de guerre.
Et pourquoi pas ?
Parce que toi et ton pote
êtes sur le point de partir
en vacances au quartier B.
Quoi ?
Quand ?
Oh, regarde.
Je dirai maintenant.
Allez.
Eh, vous allez me manquer.
Dites bonjour à Schillinger
pour moi.
Comme vous le voyez, d'autres
prisonniers sont transférés,
y compris les membres du conseil
Pancamo et Morales.
Alors je nomme Supreme Allah
et Poet pour les remplacer
au conseil.
Said...
je te l'avais dit.
Je t'avais dit de te joindre à moi.
Mais tu n'écoutes jamais.
Tu n'écoutes jamais.
Tu sais quoi ?
C'est ce qui va finir
par te tuer.
Et qu'est-ce qui va
te tuer, toi,
le SIDA ou une overdose ?
T'inquiète pas pour moi.
Je ne m'inquiète pas.
Je m'inquiète pour ceux
qui t'entourent,
et qui respirent l'air
que tu empoisonnes.
Écoute, j'ai créé une utopie.
Un paradis africain sur terre.
C'est pas l'Afrique ici.
C'est un enfer.
On a enfin le contrôle
et tout le pouvoir.
Enfin.
Un mauvais système
dirigé par des noirs
c'est la même chose qu'un mauvais
système dirigé par des blancs.
Mauvais ? On a tout
ce qu'on veut.
On a tout
à portée de la main.
Tu crois avoir créé le monde,
n'est-ce pas ?
Simon,
c'est juste une illusion.
Le vrai pouvoir ne peut venir
que de la grâce du Dieu
tout puissant.
Si je voulais,
je pourrais t'écraser
comme un cafard.
Oui, mais tu ne le feras pas
car je suis le seul
qui te dise la vérité.
Ta vérité, pas la mienne.
Adebisi a transformé Em City
en une putain de nation Zoulou.
Qu'est-ce qu'on peut
putain de faire ?
Créer notre propre pays.
McManus, faut qu'on parle.
Prends rendez-vous
avec ma secrétaire.
C'est sérieux.
Ouais, je vois.
T'as ta tête
des mauvais jours.
Votre beau petit rêve,
votre Emerald City,
est maintenant un ghetto.
Vous y êtes allé récemment ?
Des cochonneries qui traînent
partout, de la drogue partout,
pas assez de couleurs.
Ce quartier n'est plus
sous ma responsabilité.
Eh, c'est pas un problème.
Ce que nous ne voulons pas
c'est que l'ambiance de là-bas
vienne se glisser ici.
S'ils entendent parler
de ce qui se passe,
l'émancipation,
ils vont vouloir
la même chose ici.
Et tu suggères quoi,
que le quartier B
devienne uniquement blanc ?
Oui.
Fous-moi le camp.
Laissez Em City aux nègres.
Putain, laissez-leur
toute la foutue prison,
du moment qu'on est
en sécurité ici.
Au revoir, Vern.
Soyez pas plus bête
que vous l'avez déjà été.
On boucle !
- Bouclez le quartier !
- Vous verrez.
Vous regretterez de ne pas
m'avoir écouté.
Maintenant !
La nouvelle clôture électrique sera
opérationnelle vendredi prochain.
Alors, nous pourrons éliminer
la surveillance continue
depuis la tour
et faire des économies
de main d'œuvre considérables.
Eh, désolé d'être en retard.
Emerald City est un vrai merdier !
McManus...
Il y a des ordures partout.
Oh ? Et on peut manger
par terre au quartier B.
Ça suffit !
Cet enculé
est jaloux de moi.
- Jaloux ?
- C'est ça.
- Martin, je vous en prie.
- Non, il le sait.
Depuis que j'ai repris Em City, il n'y a
pratiquement pas eu de violence.
Mon système marche.
A quel prix ?
Hein ?
A quel putain de prix ?
McManus ?
McManus ?
Bon Dieu, McManus,
je vous en prie, arrêtez-vous.
Les conditions à Emerald City
se détériorent rapidement.
Il faut faire quelque chose
pour arrêter Adebisi.
Eh, pourquoi vous venez
me voir, moi ?
- Parlez à Querns.
- Je l'ai fait.
Querns veut bien
fermer les yeux sur ce que
fait Adebisi tant que l'ordre
est maintenu.
Alors parlez à Glynn.
J'ai essayé ça aussi.
Il semble indifférent,
distrait par sa campagne électorale.
Non.
Tout dépend de vous et moi.
Vous et moi ?
Il faut arrêter Adebisi, et vite.
Si cela signifie éliminer Querns,
ainsi soit-il.
- Vous avez un plan ?
- Ouais...
J'ai un plan.
J'avais tort, Adebisi.
Je m'en rends compte.
Tu as vraiment
transformé ce quartier
en paradis.
Une utopie.
Je vais le dire
devant tout le monde.
Je veux me joindre à toi,
et te servir comme tu l'entendras.
- Tu es sérieux ?
- Oui.
Alors jure le,
au nom d'Allah.
Je le jure.
J'ai attendu cet instant.
Maintenant je peux
faire de toi mon égal.
Ensemble il n'y a rien
que nous ne puissions faire.
Rien.
Rien.
Rien, rien.
Rien.
Rien.
Rien. Rien.
Rien. Rien.
Tapez dans vos mains !
Adebisi et Said,
main dans la main.
C'est la fin
du putain d'univers.
Ces chiffres du recensement
dont je parlais,
on les utilise aussi pour déterminer
les zones électorales.
Un sénateur d'une zone rurale blanche
avec une prison
peut compter les détenus
comme ses administrés
et, par conséquent, augmenter
son influence politique.
Ces détenus, en majorité
des hommes de couleur,
n'ont pas le droit de voter.
Le sénateur n'a aucune
allégeance pour eux.
En fait, il a tout avantage
à voter des lois
pour les garder en prison
plus longtemps.
La ville profite
du nombre grandissant
de la population carcérale.
Ouais.
Tout le monde en profite.
Quelqu'un doit l'arrêter et vite.
Nora ?
Je suis désolée de passer
à l'improviste.
Je sais que vous êtes occupé avec
la prison, votre campagne et tout,
- mais je ne savais pas qui appeler.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
C'est Clayton.
Mon doux Jésus, je ne connais plus
mon propre fils.
Il donne
un pistolet à un détenu,
et puis son costume africain,
et maintenant...
Quoi ?
J'ai trouvé ça
dans sa chambre.
C'est comme s'il amassait
toute sa colère contre le monde
et qu'il la dirige
sur le gouverneur.
Où est-il maintenant ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne l'ai pas vu depuis des jours.
Quand il rentre,
vous m'appelez, Ok ?
En attendant, essayez de ne pas
vous inquiéter, d'accord ?
Avec ces nouvelles vestes
pare coups de couteaux,
les gardiens de prisons
ici et dans tout l'État
auront la meilleure des protections.
Leur sécurité est de la plus grande
importance pour moi.
Ce sont les hommes et les femmes
qui repoussent les forces du mal.
Il y a ceux qui disent
plus de prisons ?
Et bien je dis,
plus de crimes.
Va te faire enculer !
Appelez un médecin,
faites venir un toubib.
On a tiré sur le gouverneur !
Appelez de l'aide !
Faites venir un médecin !
Dans les années 50,
il y avait une émission TV
qui s'appelait
"Misez votre vie",
animée par Groucho Marx.
Chaque semaine,
Groucho posait des questions
et insultait les candidats.
Un faux canard attaché
à une ficelle tombait
et Groucho disait...
Dîtes-moi le mot de passe,
et vous gagnerez 100$"
Évidemment, les candidats
ne misaient pas leur vie :
pas comme à Oz.
Personne ne mettait
sa vie en danger.
La tentative d'assassinat
sur le gouverneur James Devlin
par un ancien employé
de la prison d'Oswald
a mis en branle
sa campagne électorale
et l'État entier.
Devlin, dont
la condition est stable,
a annoncé qu'il ne retirait pas
sa candidature.
Le suspect, Clayton Hughes,
est en détention à Crown
and Shield, sans caution.
Clayton ! Clayton !
Tuez Hughes !
Tuez Hughes !
- Sean.
- On boucle tout ?
Allez, on boucle !
On se bouge le cul !
Allez, dans vos cellules !
On y va !
Dans ta cellule !
Maintenant !
Clayton Hughes
est un ami proche,
et bien que son acte
soit impardonnable,
je me sens dans l'obligation,
pour respect pour sa mère
et son défunt père,
de rester à ses côtés
dans cette épreuve.
Je retire donc
ma candidature
à la position
de gouverneur adjoint.
Ce sera tout.
Encore en train de jouer.
Vous revendez pas assez.
Comment ça,
on revend pas assez ?
- Tu délires.
- Qui vend plus que nous ?
Desmond Mobay.
Ce putain
de Jamaïcain.
Va te faire foutre.
Mettez-y la dose.
Viens.
Hé, Mobay.
Faut arrêter de nous faire
passer pour des tartouses.
Tu piges ?
Je fais ce qu'on me dit.
Ben on te dit autre chose.
Tu me fais pas peur.
Et toi non plus.
Hé, on se calme !
Faut apprendre
à contrôler tes émotions.
- Va avec l'Agent Keating.
- Je vais au trou ?
Pas cette fois. L'inspecteur
McGorry veut te voir.
J'connais pas de McGorry.
Un flic de la Criminelle qui enquête
sur le meurtre de Bruno Goergen.
J'sais rien sur Bruno Goergen.
C'est à elle
qu'il faut le dire.
Pauvre con.
D'après le dossier,
Leroy Tidd et vous
avez eu une altercation
avec Bruno Goergen
au gymnase.
- Une alter-quoi ?
- Une dispute.
On faisait que déconner.
Vous l'avez mis en sang.
Ouais, ben...
des fois on s'emporte.
Il est vivant.
Pas pour longtemps.
J'ai pas poussé Goergen
dans la cage d'ascenseur.
Alors c'est qui ?
Le seul qui en avait
après Goergen, c'était Mobay.
- Desmond Mobay ?
- Ouais.
Y'avait un truc
bizarre entre eux.
Je suis là.
Assieds-toi.
J'ai fait une découverte
pas très plaisante.
Comment ça ?
Y'a un agent secret à Oz.
Merde.
Il s'appelle Brand,
Cecil Brand.
Il est au bloc B.
C'est un de tes clients.
- On fait quoi, alors ?
- On lui fait sa fête.
- Qui ?
- Toi.
Je veux que tu tues
ce putain de flic.
Pas de problème.
Vas-y.
Tu sais,
pendant un temps,
je croyais que
t'étais agent secret.
Mais bon,
c'est pas possible,
vue la quantité de merde
que tu t'es enfilée
et toute la merde
que tu revends.
Je sais, c'est dingue.
Mais la nuit où
t'étais remonté à bloc,
ton accent
a soudain disparu,
et je me suis dit,
"C'est quoi, ce bordel ?"
Et puis ta copine...
c'est quoi, son nom ?
Kina ?
J'étais sûr de l'avoir
déjà vue quelque part.
Je me suis creusé
la cervelle
pour essayer de me rappeler.
Puis j'ai eu un flash.
Non ! Non !
Quand ils m'ont jeté du toit,
j'étais allongé
sur le bitume froid,
et une femme agent
est venue voir
si j'étais vivant.
Cette femme...
elle ressemble à ta Tina
comme deux gouttes d'eau.
Extinction des feux !
Bonne nuit, Mobay.
Ou devrais-je t'appeler
inspecteur de mes deux ?
Tu racontes ça
à qui que ce soit,
et t'es le prochain à sauter
dans la cage d'ascenseur.
Ça suffit, là-dedans !
Je dis rien à personne.
Je dis à personne
que t'es flic,
un flic qui désobéit à la loi
au nom de la loi.
Mais je veux que tu saches
que t'es un imposteur.
Et je fais pas seulement
référence à ton boulot.
Je parle de
ta personne même.
T'es qu'un imposteur.
Il est vivant !
Appelez un docteur !
- J'ai tué Bruno Goergen.
- Quoi ?
J'ai commis un crime,
je dois être puni.
Pourquoi confesser ?
Parce que
j'ai prêté serment.
Parce que je suis pas
un imposteur.
Parce que je veux pas
devenir comme eux.
L'arrestation de
l'inspecteur Basil
pour le meurtre
de Bruno Goergen
met fin à notre opération
anti-stupéfiants,
au moins pour le moment.
Avec tout le respect que je vous dois,
il va falloir accepter le fait
que la guerre contre
la drogue est vaine.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Il faut simplement
ne pas laisser tomber.
Il ne faut pas renoncer à l'éducation,
et s'efforcer de réhabiliter.
Je dis pas que vous aurez pas
de petites victoires,
mais qu'il serait
stupide de penser
pouvoir éradiquer
l'héroïne d'Oz.
Qui est stupide ?
- C'est celui qui répond qui...
- Va te faire foutre !
- Ça suffit !
- Tapette !
- Allez !
- Arrêtez ! Arrêtez !
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ?
Pete !
J'en ai plus qu'assez
d'assister à ces réunions
et de vous voir
vous regarder le nombril.
Tout s'écroule
autour de nous,
et vous ne pensez qu'à vous.
Et bien...
Allez lui parler.
Pete ?
Non.
Je veux parler.
Non, ça va aller, Ray.
Vraiment,
ça va aller.
- Je suis plus en manque.
- Foutaises.
- Que faites-vous ici ?
- Je suis accroc.
J'suis en manque.
J'ai peur de repiquer.
Je ne veux pas vous voir.
Ma sœur...
vous ne pouvez pas
me refuser ça.
Oh que si...
si, je le peux.
Ramenez-le, s'il vous plaît.
Augustus,
vous alliez dire
quelque chose ?
Oui...
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
J'allais passer vous voir,
puis j'ai changé d'avis.
Je suis surprise
de vous y voir ici.
Comment ça va ?
Chaque jour
un peu mieux.
- Ouais.
- Et vous ?
J'ai pas la pêche.
J'ai reçu les documents
à signer aujourd'hui.
- Quels documents ?
- Pour renoncer à mes voeux.
Notre déjeuner ensemble,
c'est pour fêter ça ?
Je sais pas.
J'ai pas encore décidé.
Quand on devient nonne,
on devient l'épouse du Christ.
C'est dur d'accepter...
qu'une fois ma signature
apposée sur ces documents,
Christ et moi
serons divorcés.
Baise-moi,
espèce de merde.
Oh putain !
Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
Toi et cette femme.
- Quelle femme ?
- L'Agent Howell.
Quoi ?
Vous êtes mauvais.
- Allez, dis-le.
- Dire quoi ?
Il n'y a rien à dire.
Tu sais bien...
Je vais tout dire.
- La ferme, Cyril.
- Va te faire foutre.
- La ferme ou je te...
- Ou tu me quoi ?
J'ai pas peur de toi.
Je peux t'en mettre une.
Putain.
Ce putain d'endroit !
Et voilà.
Si je signe ce document,
je suis plus nonne.
Vous allez le signer ?
Oui. Vous voulez
assister à l'événement ?
Non, merci.
Ma sœur.
- Je dois vous parler.
- Je partais.
Non, mon Père.
Restez donc.
J'apprécierais
vos conseils.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- C'est mon frère.
Il a l'air d'aller mieux,
mais il fait de nouveau
des cauchemars.
Il dort donc
pas beaucoup,
et je commence
à penser que le...
comment c'est ?
- Le manque ?
- Ouais, c'est ça.
Ça commence
à affecter son cerveau.
Pourquoi ?
Que fait-il ?
Il devient agressif.
Il invente des trucs
et dit qu'il voit des choses
qui n'existent pas.
- Vraiment ?
- Ouais.
Je me demandais
si vous pourriez...
lui prescrire quelque chose,
quelque chose
qui le calme un bon coup.
Au moins pour un temps,
l'histoire qu'il récupère.
Je vais arranger
un entretien avec lui,
- et j'aviserai.
- Ok.
Mais souvenez-vous :
les trucs qu'il raconte,
c'est fou.
Vos cauchemars sont
toujours les mêmes ?
Plus ou moins.
Y a-t-il quelque chose
dans vos rêves
que vous voyez éveillé ?
Non.
Vous souvenez-vous de quoi que
ce soit d'avant votre accident ?
Avant mon coup à la tête ?
Ouais.
Les mains de ma mère.
Elles étaient calleuses,
toutes rouges
à cause du travail...
mais douces
quand elle me touchait.
Rien d'autre ?
La croix...
comme celle-ci...
autour de son cou.
Elle priait Jésus.
Vous croyez en Jésus ?
C'est une question bête.
Pourquoi donc ?
Parce que c'est pas
moi qui décide
de croire ou
ne pas croire.
On ne choisit pas Dieu.
C'est Dieu qui nous choisit.
Cyril, ça vous dérange si je parle
un instant à votre frère ?
Bien sûr que non.
Alors ?
Je ne vois aucun des symptômes
que vous décrivez.
Bien au contraire.
Il sait se tenir avec vous,
- mais je jure que...
- Ryan, ne jurez pas.
Ce qui est vrai,
c'est qu'il est épuisé,
et nous devons donc trouver
un substitut au Haldol
pour qu'il dorme.
Bien. Merci.
Dr. Prestopnik lui fera
une ordonnance.
- Bonjour, Chris.
- Ma Soeur.
Non, ne bougez pas.
Comme vous le savez,
depuis environ un mois,
je me prépare
à quitter le couvent.
Cette décision fut
en partie influencée
par la conversation
que nous avions eue.
Vous m'avez fait douter de moi
en tant que psychologue...
en tant que nonne...
en tant que femme.
Je suis désolé de vous avoir
causé de la peine.
Vous m'avez en effet
causé de la peine,
mais je veux
vous en remercier.
Quoi ?
Vous savez, Chris,
la plupart d'entre nous
menons nos vies
au hasard.
Nous devenons qui
nous sommes par accident.
On essaye de ne pas
regarder en arrière,
de peur de se rendre compte
qu'on aurait dû
faire autre chose.
Mais vous m'avez forcée
à regarder en arrière,
à remettre en question
tout ce qui constitue
mon identité.
Et en faisant ça,
savez-vous ce que
j'ai découvert ?
Je suis psychologue.
Je suis femme.
Je suis nonne.
Et tous ces éléments
ne sont pas des accidents.
Ils m'ont été donnés
par quelqu'un d'autre.
Quelqu'un de bien plus grand.
On ne choisit pas Dieu.
C'est Dieu qui nous choisit.
Qu'arrive-t-il à ceux
qu'Il ne choisit pas ?
Comme à l'école,
t'attends qu'une équipe
ou l'autre
te choisisse pour
jouer à la balle...
mais t'es trop petit,
trop bête,
ou trop bizarre.
Pour aller droit au but,
ma Soeur,
je veux que Dieu
me choisisse.
Choisis-moi !
Ça viendra peut-être.
Vous avez le temps.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je ne pense pas.
Oh putain !
Faut qu'on arrête.
Quoi ?
Ça.
- Pourquoi ?
- Y'a des rumeurs.
- J'm'en tape.
- Tu vas te faire virer.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Je te suce tellement fort
que t'en perds tes couilles ?
- Non, c'est que...
- Ça sera fini
quand je le dirai.
Tu me redis un truc pareil,
et je te brise les couilles.
Pigé ?
Bien.
Même heure demain
pour mon cunnilingus.
On y va.
Y'a rien de tel
que le frisson du pari.
Rien n'est comparable à
cette sensation d'anticipation.
L'attente haletante
pendant que le dé roule,
que la roue tourne,
que la carte se retourne.
L'attente de voir ce que
le destin nous réserve.
Bob ! Bob, tu es vivant !
On dirait bien.
Busmalis, au boulot !
Qu'a dit le docteur ?
L'opération s'est bien passée ?
La tumeur est bénigne ?
- Ouais, je survivrai, sauf que...
- Quoi ?
Je me retrouve avec
une énorme cicatrice.
Ils disent
qu'elle va s'estomper,
mais j'ai honte
de me balader comme ça.
Quel vaniteux !
M'insulte pas.
Non, c'est bien, la vanité.
Quand t'es sorti du trou,
tu te traînais.
La vanité, c'est le signe
que t'es vivant.
Arrête tes conneries.
La cicatrice
se voit à peine.
Foutaises !
C'est ton chapeau
porte-bonheur.
Il m'a déjà porté bonheur.
Je suis heureux
que tu sois vivant.
Miss Sally va vraiment
venir à Oz ?
Quand elle a su que j'étais allé
chez elle après m'être échappé,
et que je suis
son plus grand fan,
ma déesse a décidé
de me rencontrer.
Miss Sally à Oz.
Bientôt, ça sera
Jennifer Aniston.
- J'ai l'air de quoi ?
- Tu veux la vérité ?
- Non.
- Tu es très beau.
Merci.
- Où t'as eu les fleurs ?
- C'est un secret.
- Souhaite-moi bonne chance.
- C'est pas de la chance qu'il te faut.
- Miss Sally ?
- Oui.
Enchanté.
Voici pour vous.
Merci.
Elles sont très belles.
Quel plaisir
de vous rencontrer.
Quand j'ai su que vous alliez venir,
j'arrivais pas à le croire.
Ils sont tous jaloux de moi.
C'est gentil. Je vous ai
apporté quelque chose.
Oh mon Dieu.
Y'a des types
qui tueraient pour ça...
littéralement.
Miss Sally,
je dois vous dire,
vous ne riez pas
comme à la télé.
Et en fait,
tant qu'on y est,
vous n'êtes pas
comme à la télé.
Vous êtes moins ronde.
La caméra ajoute
bien 5 kgs.
Sur les seins aussi ?
Merde.
Miss Sally, quel langage.
Dans l'émission d'hier,
vous déconseilliez les gros mots.
Je suis pas Miss Sally.
Je suis secrétaire
aux studios.
Je réponds aux lettres
que Miss Sally reçoit.
Quand j'ai appris votre évasion,
je me suis souvenue de vos lettres.
Elles étaient si gentilles.
J'ai demandé à Miss Sally
de vous rendre visite.
- Et elle a refusé ?
- Elle était furieuse.
Elle m'a balancé Neuter
à la figure.
Alors je me suis dit que
je ressemblais à cette garce
et que je pourrais
me faire passer pour elle.
Mais ça a pas marché.
Non, je suis content
que vous ayez lu mes lettres
et que vous soyez là.
- C'est comment, votre nom ?
- Norma Clark.
Merci, Norma.
De rien, Agamemnon.
Si ça vous dérange pas,
j'aimerais continuer à écrire.
Bien sûr.
Mais cette fois,
c'est à vous que j'écrirai.
Ça serait chouette.
Tout le monde fait des paris...
du roi de la carte
à Atlantic City
à la petite vieille qui gratte
un ticket de loterie.
Tenter sa chance,
tout risquer,
c'est un besoin
humain de base,
comme la nourriture
et un lit où dormir.
C'est aussi ancré dans nos gènes
que de tuer son prochain.
Deyell, qu'est-ce
que tu fous ?
Je creuse un tunnel
pour m'évader.
Quel con de nègre.
Sac à foutre.
- Miles.
- Non. non, non !
Non, non !
- Miles.
- Non, non, non.
Ton exécution aura lieu
jeudi en deux.
Il y a certaines choses
dont il faut qu'on parle.
- Non, non, non !
- La plus importante
- étant ton moyen d'exécution.
- Non, non, non !
Si tu te décides pas,
je vais devoir décider pour toi.
Non ! Non ! Non !
Emmenez-le chez la psy.
Debout, Rembrandt.
Donne-moi...
Foutez-lui en une !
Attendez un peu.
Je peux pas lui parler
enchaîné comme ça.
Je crois pas que
vous vouliez le voir s'enfuir.
Très bien.
Attendez dehors.
Pas question.
Attendez dehors.
Entrez donc.
Marc...
le directeur a pensé
qu'il serait bon qu'on parle.
Il dit que vous avez du mal
à accepter le fait
que la date de...
votre exécution approche.
J'ai du mal à accepter ?
J'ai une trouille d'enfer.
J'ai vu Shirley Bellinger partir
et Ginzburg le pédé mourir
juste à côté de moi.
Ça fait réfléchir.
Écoutez...
je suis pas une grande fan
de la peine capitale,
et je suis pas la seule
qui essaye d'y mettre fin.
Mais rien ne va changer
d'ici à deux semaines.
Oh mon Dieu.
Marc...
vous avez pris la décision
de tuer votre famille,
et par conséquent,
vous n'êtes plus maître
des décisions concernant votre vie.
Ce dont vous avez besoin,
et ce que je veux
vous aider à faire,
c'est...
de vous préparer.
Je sais ce que tu ressens.
Des fois, la pensée de ce qui va arriver
me fout en l'air aussi.
J'ai pas besoin de ta pitié.
Tu sais pas t'arrêter, hein ?
J'essaye de bosser,
alors ferme ta grande gueule.
La ferme.
Je t'ai dit de la fermer,
sale négro !
Putain !
Hey, Lopresti.
Je peux avoir ce miroir ?
C'était à Shirley.
Oh non.
Sept ans de malheur.
Extinction des feux !
- Merde !
- Fais place.
Laisse jouer un vrai joueur.
- Schillinger.
- Schillinger.
T'as de la visite.
J'attends personne.
C'est ta belle-fille.
Ma quoi ?
M. Schillinger ?
Ouais ?
Je suis Carrie.
La femme de Hank.
Écoute, poupée, je sais pas
quelle manigance tu...
Il vous a pas dit
qu'il était marié ?
Non.
Mon Dieu.
Ça va ?
Elle va bien.
Occupe-toi de ton cul !
Je suis désolée.
C'est que j'ai si peur.
Hank et moi, on s'est rencontrés, et
on a tout de suite couché ensemble.
On passait tout
notre temps ensemble.
Il y a quelques semaines,
il a reçu
une somme d'argent
et a voulu qu'on se marie.
J'ai accepté.
Et il est parti.
Il a disparu
de la surface de la terre,
et je sais pas
ce que je vais faire.
Tu peux me prouver
que vous êtes mariés ?
Notre acte de mariage.
On s'est mariés à la mairie.
Pourquoi il m'a rien dit ?
C'est tout Hank.
M. Mystère.
Je sais où il est.
Il est à Miami.
Je l'ai aidé à payer le voyage.
Miami ?
Il revient quand ?
- Je sais pas.
- Bientôt, j'espère.
Y'a intérêt.
Parce que...
j'ai un petit problème.
Et j'ai besoin de son aide.
Quel problème ?
Je peux t'aider.
Je suis enceinte.
- C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
- J'veux pas t'entendre.
- Quoi ?
- Fous-moi la paix.
Crois-moi...
j'ai assez vu
ta sale tronche
comme ça, ok ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Ce gamin veut pas qu'on lui parle.
- Va te faire foutre.
Mondo...
J'suis pas ton chien.
Et je suis pas
ta pute non plus.
J'en ai ras le cul
de tes conneries.
Ah, les enfants
d'aujourd'hui.
Faut qu'on lui
fasse la fermer.
Relaxe... écoute.
j'veux te parler
d'une ou deux choses.
Y'a de l'orage dans l'air.
Ça change pas
grand chose pour nous.
Tu sais comment
on appelle ça ?
Une grosse bourre.
Et faut qu'on y mette
notre grain de sel.
J'aime pas être en minorité,
mais que peut-on faire ?
Même ces putains de musulmans
se plient devant Adebisi.
On pourrait faire exploser
quelques charges
bien placées.
Fais-moi savoir
de quoi t'as besoin.
Mon Dieu !
Oh mon Dieu !
A l'aide !
Au meurtre !
Au meurtre ! Au meurtre !
Au meurtre !
Comme si j'avais pas eu
assez de merdes aujourd'hui.
Tu sais ce qu'on vient de trouver ?
Un macchabée.
Tu sais ce que ça veut dire ?
Mon plan anti-violence
est kaput.
Et tu sais ce que
ça veut dire ?
T'es dans la merde
jusqu'au cou.
J'y suis pour rien.
Oh que si.
On était d'accord.
Je te laissais faire
ce que bon te semblait
tant que tu limitais
les conneries à zéro.
Et un cadavre,
c'est pas zéro.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Trouve l'enculé qui a fait ça,
et sers-le moi sur un plateau...
- vivant, bien sûr.
- Je dois jouer au flic ?
J'ai pas dit
que la vie était rose.
Du nouveau ?
Shemin, le macchabée,
c'était un vrai loser.
Il avait pas d'amis,
et qu'on sache,
- pas d'ennemis non plus.
- On a appris une chose.
Lui et Tobias Beecher
baisaient ensemble.
Beecher ?
Je veux le voir.
J'ai pas tué Shemin.
On dit que
tu baisais avec lui.
Une fois.
Et c'était pas terrible.
Avec toi non plus,
d'ailleurs, Mondo.
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je cherche l'arme du crime.
Adebisi a dit que si
je trouvais pas le coupable,
j'allais en prendre une.
Touche à ton cul.
Je t'ai vu entrer
dans la buanderie...
avec Shemin.
T'en es ressorti seul.
Et alors ?
Pourquoi tu l'as tué ?
Tu vois ce tatouage ?
Je me le suis fait faire le soir
de mon deuxième mariage.
J'venais de rouler
un couple de vieux,
alors je voulais fêter ça
avec du bon whisky,
un peu d'ecstacy
et beaucoup de Bonnie.
Pendant qu'on baisait,
je criais : "Je suis Dieu !
Putain, je suis Dieu !"
Je tripais comme un fou.
Je suis allé dans
un magasin de tatouages
parce que je voulais
que tout le monde sache
que j'étais tout-puissant.
Mais je ne le suis pas.
Je le sais bien, Beecher,
mais ce tatouage est
pas près de s'effacer.
Et je suis censé tirer quoi
de cette histoire ?
Et bien...
je te vois baiser
tout un tas de types.
T'as dit que tu t'en foutais
de qui je baisais.
C'est pas vrai.
T'as tué Shemin
parce qu'on a baisé ensemble ?
Non, je...
- Je vais dire tout ça à Adebisi.
- Oh je crois pas.
- Et pourquoi pas ?
- Pour deux raisons.
D'abord, je sais
que t'as demandé à Pancamo
- de percer Hank Schillinger.
- Non, non.
Oh si, et Hank est mort.
Vern est pas au courant,
mais seulement parce que
Pancamo s'assure
que personne
trouve le corps.
Disons qu'ils trouvent le corps.
Schillinger va se venger
et tuer toute ta famille.
Il va tuer Holly.
- Va te faire foutre.
- La deuxième raison,
c'est que si tu lui dis que
j'ai tué Shemin, je suis mort.
Et tu m'aimes trop
pour les laisser faire ça.
Mondo, comment ça va,
ma poule ?
Et Browne,
c'était un bon coup ?
Arrête.
Fais gaffe
où tu mets ta bite.
Elle fait des ravages.
Je préférais quand
on se parlait pas.
Sur une même pièce d'argent,
les côtés gagnant et perdant cohabitent.
Mais gagner n'est pas toujours bon.
Réfléchissez.
Soudain, vous gagnez
le gros lot.
Vous vous demandez comment
dépenser tout ça, comment l'investir.
Vous achetez des trucs
dont vous avez pas besoin
et soudain,
vous avez que dalle.
Perdre, par contre,
a un effet purificateur.
Quand on n'a rien,
et qu'on se retrouve
sans sa chemise,
on est libre.
Supreme Allah,
c'est quoi son problème
à Mondo Browne ?
Il cherche les problèmes.
Un emmerdeur
de grande classe.
Tu t'es chargé du reste ?
Ouais, j'ai appelé. Le camion
de livraison va crever en route.
Bon.
Browne, en rang.
J'attends une livraison.
Le camion a crevé.
Si on reçoit pas la livraison,
pas de petit déj demain.
Je repasserai te voir.
Les autres, on y va.
C'est ça que tu cherches ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fous là ?
On doit discuter
d'une truc tous les deux.
Je veux rien avoir
à faire avec toi.
Une petite pipe,
ça te dit ?
Ok.
Browne est mort.
Foutaises.
Percé à la cantine.
C'est pas Em City.
Mais il en fait partie.
Glynn est furax.
Tout ce à quoi on a travaillé
est prêt à s'effondrer.
On a trouvé ça.
Tu sais à qui appartient
ce collier ?
Oui.
- On y va.
- Quoi ?
- On y va.
- Quoi ?
T'as tué Shemin.
Pourquoi je l'aurais tué ?
Il valait rien.
- T'as tué Browne.
- Regarde.
Il a dû tomber quand
j'étais à la cuisine.
Ah ouais ?
Espèce d'enculé !
- Va te faire foutre, salope !
- Va te faire foutre !
Va te faire foutre !
Va te faire foutre, salope !
Va te faire foutre !
J'vais te tuer !
Fouteur de merde !
- Va te faire foutre !
- J'vais te tuer !
On a trouvé ça sous
l'oreiller de Supreme.
C'est pas à moi !
Bande d'enculés !
C'est quoi, cette merde ?
Lâchez-moi !
C'est des foutaises !
Lâchez-moi, putain !
J'ai rien fait !
Lâchez-moi, enculés !
Ouvrez les portes.
Shemin et Browne
sont morts.
Tués de la main de Dieu.
Peut-être...
mais tout ça colle-t-il avec ton désir
de faire tomber Adebisi ?
Oh oui.
Je me rapproche de lui
pour trouver la faiblesse...
qui le perdra.
J'espère que
c'est pour bientôt.
Adebisi ?
J'ai dit lentement.
J'ai dit lentement !
Tu comprends pas ?
T'es même pas une femme.
Attends-moi là.
Je dois dire
que j'en reviens pas que
tu te joignes à Adebisi.
Je sais pas ce qu'il...
Attends.
Quand on pense
à tes croyances,
c'est dur de prendre
cette conversion au sérieux.
J'ai juré devant Allah.
Je crois que tout ça,
c'est pour essayer
de l'arrêter.
T'as toujours eu
beaucoup d'imagination.
J'ai pas que ça.
J'ai aussi le flair pour repérer
les gagnants et les perdants.
Et toi, tu vas gagner.
En tous cas, je l'espère.
Quoi de neuf, Poet ?
C'est fini, la vie de gangster ?
Rien n'est fini,
sauf Adebisi
et ses putains de vidéos.
Quelles vidéos ?
Il aime tout mettre
sur film, pour la postérité.
Sexe et drogues, c'est ça ?
Et la vie à Partyland.
Tu peux me les avoir,
ces vidéos ?
Il les garde bien cachées.
Mais je peux essayer.
Maintenant.
Simon, je peux te parler ?
Je t'écoute.
En privé.
Il faut encourager
nos jeunes frères
à assister aux cours,
à se faire une éducation.
- Ça te plaît ?
- C'est excellent.
Si tu racontes
que tu m'as vu ici,
t'es mort.
Tu m'entends ?
Tu m'entends ?
Simon, j'ai pas fini.
On parlera plus tard.
Il faudra le dire à Querns.
Plus tard.
Elles sont dans le faux plafond,
mais j'ai pas eu le temps
d'en prendre une.
Beaucoup d'Amérindiens,
qu'on appelle Indiens,
vivaient dans des réserves,
dans la misère totale.
L'alcoolisme était courant,
et le moral était bas.
Jusqu'à ce
qu'un grand chef eût l'idée
d'utiliser la terre
pas pour chasser le bison,
mais pour construire un casino
et faire de l'argent.
Puis tout d'un coup,
la vie des membres de la tribu
a changé pour le mieux.
Comme quoi, des fois
on peut se débarrasser de ses vices
en exploitant
ceux des autres.
C'est dingue.
Je sais.
Malheureusement,
c'est le seul moyen.
Tu vas demander à Adebisi
d'emménager avec lui,
- dans sa tanière ?
- Je veux ces vidéos.
Qu'est-ce qui te fait croire
qu'il acceptera ?
Crois-moi...
il va accepter.
J'fume même pas
ces trucs-là.
Quoi de neuf, Poet ?
Hé, Leroy.
Quoi de neuf ?
- Rien.
- Mondo...
un sacré type.
Il s'est fait descendre. Ça va ?
Pas vraiment.
- Donne-moi de ça.
- Tiens.
Y'a plus que toi et moi.
Faut qu'on se protège
maintenant.
- Ouais.
- Adebisi est un vrai dingue.
Je vais te dire.
T'as plus
à t'inquiéter d'Adebisi.
- A bon ?
- Non.
Said et moi,
on mijote un truc.
Vrai ?
C'est quoi, ce plan ?
Je peux pas te dire.
C'est top secret.
- C'est clair.
- C'est clair.
Je pige.
A plus, mon frère.
Ok.
- C'est ce qu'on pensait.
- Très bien.
Tu veux que je perce Poet ?
Non, pas tout de suite.
Je veux pas
qu'ils sachent qu'on sait.
- Bienvenue.
- Merci.
Alors...
quel lit tu veux ?
Quand fut votre dernière
visite à Emerald City ?
Je ne m'en souviens pas.
- Après l'arrivée de Querns ?
- Probablement.
Putain, il serait temps
d'y retourner, non ?
Surveillez votre langage !
Leo, il s'agit pas
que de mon ego.
Leur comportement
est illégal, immoral,
et Querns fait l'aveugle.
Vous lui avez donné carte blanche
parce qu'il maintenait la paix,
mais deux prisonniers
sont morts.
Il faut agir.
Je me souviens
quand tu es arrivé à Oz.
Jefferson Keane
t'avait provoqué.
T'avais demandé à un de tes amis
musulmans de te frapper fort,
jusqu'au sang.
Je savais pas
quoi penser de tout ça.
Et je sais toujours pas.
Simon, toi et moi
avons fait
un chemin incroyable.
J'ai essayé
d'en tirer une leçon,
de trouver ce
qui nous unit tous.
Le crime.
Le crime est
notre point commun.
Nous sommes tous des hommes
mauvais, y compris toi.
Je sais que
tu veux me détruire.
Simon...
je ne veux pas
te détruire.
Je veux t'aider à changer.
C'est exactement
ce qui me détruirait.
Je suis qui je suis,
tout comme toi.
Et je fais ce que je fais,
comme toi.
Ça veut dire
que tu vas me tuer ?
Te tuer ?
Je veux plutôt t'embrasser.
Mais je t'admire
plus que je te désire, alors...
C'est ça que tu voulais.
Pourquoi tu me la donnes ?
Parce que j'ai tout.
Tout ce dont j'ai besoin,
tous mes désirs
sont assouvis.
Mais ça ne suffit pas.
Ça ne sera jamais assez.
Mais comme tu as dit,
entre toi et moi, nous pouvons
aider notre peuple.
Et pourquoi ?
On est toujours à Oz.
Embrasse mon pied.
Eteignez-moi ça.
Leo...
Quoi, Querns ?
C'est quoi, votre excuse ?
Vous saviez pas ?
Vous saviez ?
Peu importe.
Vous êtes viré.
Veuillez escorter
M. Querns dehors.
Laissez-moi au moins
prendre mes affaires.
Nous vous les ferons envoyer.
Dehors.
Passez une bonne soirée.
Tout ça, c'est ma faute.
Avec la campagne,
j'ai négligé mon travail.
Vous voulez Em City ?
Que je réfléchisse... Oui.
Ok, écoutez,
tout le monde.
Me revoilà !
Les personnes suivantes
seront transférées d'Em City.
Quand vous entendrez votre nom,
prenez vos affaires,
et mettez-vous en file
derrière l'Agent Johnson.
93A234, Adebisi.
- 00T255, Tidd.
- C'est quoi, cette merde ?
097 C332, Cody.
00W216, Washington.
La fin est proche, c'est ça ?
Les choses vont redevenir
comme avant.
Pas pour toi, ni pour moi.
T'as dit que
t'allais pas me tuer !
Tu as juré devant Allah
être mon frère.
- Je le pensais.
- Menteur !
Menteur.
Je t'ai donné cette vidéo
pour tester ta loyauté,
ton amitié.
- Ton amour !
- Oh mon Dieu !
- C'est ainsi que je vais mourir.
- Non !
Non !
Oh si !
Ici 25, on a
un 16 sur les bras.
Lâche.
Lâche ça !
Doucement.
Laissez-moi passer !
"Oz...
le nom qu'on donne
ŗ la maison d'arrÍt
haute sťcuritť d'Oswald.
A Oz, toutes nos journťes
sont structurťes.
On sait ŗ quelle heure on mangera,
dormira, travaillera,
ŗ quelle heure on aura
du temps libre.
Donner du temps libre ŗ une personne
enfermťe est une bonne blague,
vu qu'il y a encore
des tas de restrictions
sur ce que l'on peut faire
et ne pas faire.
Certaines personnes
essaient de s'amťliorer
en lisant ou
en faisant de l'exercice.
Certaines prient...
d'autres magouillent.
D'autres regardent juste la tťlť.
En direct de nos studios
de Burbank en Californie.
C'est l'heure de jouer
ŗ "Augmenter la Mise",
prťsentť par Gordon Elliot.
Bonjour et bienvenue
ŗ "Augmenter la Mise".
Voici notre premier joueur ce soir.
M. John Carpenter.
Et voici notre star.
Avec nous ce soir, la divine,
la parfaite, Mlle Eartha Kitt.
Eartha, mille fois merci
d'Ítre ici ce soir.
On commence
par la catťgorie mode.
Regardez cette photo.
Dites-moi quel type
de barbe porte cet homme ?
J'ai besoin d'un indice.
Eartha ?
Je peux vous donner un indice.
«a s'appelle aussi un Rob Petrie.
Rob Petrie ?
C'est un bouc, pauvre con !
Allez, dis-le, un bouc.
Il pourrait dire un bouc,
mais il aurait tort.
C'est pas un bouc ?
- C'est un Van Dyke.
- Un Van Dyke ?
"Rob Petrie" ?
T'as compris ?
Non, qui c'est Rob Petrie ?
Fermez vos gueules,
qu'on puisse entendre la rťponse !
- C'est fini !
- Il s'agit d'un Dick, ou Van Dyke.
Augmentez ma mise !
Oui, on est occupťs
et heureux gr‚ce ŗ la tťlť.
Je suis ce qu'on appelle
productrice de segment.
Chacune de nos ťmissions est divisťe
en quatre histoires de 10 minutes
chacune prťsentťe par
un journaliste diffťrent.
- Je travaille pour Jack Eldridge.
- Ah, je l'aime bien, un rentre-dedans.
Ce truc sur le fioul de chauffage,
vous l'avez bien, eu ce guignol.
- Asseyez-vous.
- On veut faire une sťrie sur Oswald.
La visite d'une des prisons
les plus dures d'Amťrique.
- Non.
- Non ?
J'ai vu ce qu'il a fait ŗ ce mec
et je ne veux pas Ítre ŗ sa place.
Qu'avez-vous ŗ cacher ?
Rien. Mais depuis l'ťmeute
il y a quatre ans,
la vie ŗ Oz est rude.
«a commence
tout juste ŗ se calmer.
Si vous amenez des camťras,
vous allez ŗ nouveau les chauffer.
J'ai parlť au prťfet,
et il est d'accord.
- J'appellerai le gouverneur.
- Il est d'accord aussi.
Si vous avez dťjŗ la permission,
si tout est dans la poche,
- pourquoi vous me demandez ?
- Pour voir votre rťaction.
On va commencer par un aperÁu
de la vie ŗ Oswald,
puis on va suivre un nouveau
prisonnier qui arrivera
et on terminera avec Jack Eldrige
qui passera la nuit enfermť
dans une cellule.
- La nuit ?
- Oui, lui et un vrai prisonnier.
Et quand est-ce que
le big boss arrive ?
Pas avant le premier
jour de tournage.
J'aurai une ťquipe ici
pendant les prochains jours
pendant les entretiens prťliminaires
avec votre ťquipe et autant
de prisonniers que possible.
Comprenez bien que notre but
est de montrer au public
ŗ quel point
votre travail est difficile
et aussi de mettre
une baffe ŗ "60 Minutes".
C'est tout.
Demain et pendant plusieurs jours,
une ťquipe tťlť sera parmi nous
pour faire un reportage sur Oz.
Du calme ! Du calme !
Je sais que devant les camťras,
vous allez faire votre cinťma.
Plaider l'innocence,
faire des entourloupes, critiquer,
et tout ce qui attirera
l'attention sur vous,
et vous montrera ŗ la tťlť.
Mais je vous prťviens.
Quand les camťras seront parties,
je serai toujours lŗ.
Quand Áa passera ŗ la tťlť,
je regarderai
et je n'oublierai pas ce que
vous direz ou ferez.
C'est tout.
Extinction des feux !
Je vais rťflťchir ŗ des bons trucs
ŗ raconter ŗ ce branleur.
Il ne va prendre que
des morceaux choisis.
- Tu vas inventer des trucs ?
- Je vais pas lui dire la vťritť, hein ?
Mais je veux passer ŗ la tťlť.
Faut bien que ma belle gueule
me serve ŗ quelque chose.
- Tu vas parler ŗ ces journaleux ?
- Oui.
J'ai plein de trucs ŗ dire
sur les conditions de vie ici.
Et s'ils demandent pour Adebisi ?
Adebisi.
J'ai ťtť acquittť.
Lťgitime dťfense.
MÍme McManus
a tťmoignť pour moi.
Oui, mais les journalistes...
ils aiment bien remuer la merde
et faire passer les musulmans
pour des criminels.
Arif, je ne crains rien.
- On va passer ŗ la tťlť ?
- Moi oui.
Mais si tu vois une camťra,
tu dťgages, OK ?
- Pourquoi ?
- Tu te souviens de Jack Elridge ?
- Non.
- Moi oui.
Il nous a bien baisťs, Cyril.
Il nous a vraiment bien baisťs.
On va peut-Ítre pouvoir se venger.
Va te coucher.
Eh, toi !
Matricule 01W711,
Omar White.
Condamnť le 4 janvier 2001.
Pour assassinat.
Sentence : 75 ans.
Possibilitť de sursis
dans 20 ans.
Ouais, Áa c'est cool.
Matte-moi cette salope.
Ici c'est les arrivťes et les dťparts,
oý les prisonniers entrent et sortent,
sauf s'ils sont dans un sac.
- Lequel c'est, Omar White ?
- White, Omar !
Ouais, ouais, ouais, viens-lŗ.
Je suis l'Agent Murphy.
Cette ťquipe a ťtť autorisťe ŗ vous
suivre lors de votre premier jour.
- «a vous pose un problŤme ?
- Oh, je vais passer ŗ la tťlť ?
- Ouep.
- Pas de problŤme.
- Toi et moi, poupťe ?
- Du calme, Omar.
M. White, vous Ítes ici
pour 75 ans, pour meurtre.
- C'est exact ?
- Je la connaissais pas cette salope.
Pourquoi est-ce que
j'aurais voulu la buter ?
C'ťtait le tťmoin principal
au procŤs de votre cousin.
Votre erreur a ťtť
de ne pas tuer la petite fille.
Ah ouais ?
Merde.
- J'veux dire... merde.
- En rang, espŤce de mťtŤque.
Qui t'appelle mťtŤque, hein ?
Jake Willard, raccompagnez
M. White dans les rangs !
Dťgage !
Vous voyez
ce que je veux dire ?
On me brime !
L‚che-moi, enculť !
Vous savez pas ŗ qui
vous avez affaire.
Il y a 500 prisonniers
qui arrivent chaque semaine ?
- Ouais.
- Et combien sont rel‚chťs ?
Pas assez.
Voici Emerald City,
aussi appelťe "Em City",
le bloc expťrimental crťť
par Tim McManus il y a 5 ans.
A Em City, les prisonniers
ont beaucoup plus de libertť.
Eh, poupťe, t'en veux un bout ?
Eh, Hoyt, dťgage ! Bon sang.
Le premier ŗ qui je veux parler
est Tobias Beecher.
Euh, d'accord, c'est par lŗ.
OK, M. Beecher.
«a marche comme Áa :
on va juste parler de maniŤre
informelle, sans pression,
et selon la conversation,
on dťcidera
si vous serez interviewť
par Jack Eldridge.
- Donc Áa tourne pas, lŗ ?
- Euh, si, Áa tourne.
- Mais on peut arrÍter si vous voulez.
- «a m'est ťgal.
Vous Ítes arrivť en 1997
pour conduite en ťtat d'ivresse
- et homicide involontaire.
- Ouais.
Avant vous ťtiez
un brillant avocat
d'une famille importante avec
une femme et deux enfants.
Comment la vie en prison
vous a-t-elle changť ?
Dťcrivez certaines de vos expťriences
depuis votre arrivťe.
Dťcrire ?
Vous avez dťjŗ lu
le livre de Job ?
D'aprŤs le dossier,
on vous a cassť bras et jambes,
- et vous avez aussi ťtť poignardť.
- Ouais.
Vous voulez voir la cicatrice ?
Vous avez attachť un prisonnier
et lui avez dťfťquť sur la tÍte.
- Ouais.
- C'est le prix de la survie ?
Je ne suis plus
l'homme que j'ťtais.
Ou je suis l'homme que
j'ai toujours ťtť sans le savoir.
Ces incidents ont impliquť
deux autres prisonniers,
Christopher Keller
et Vernon Schillinger.
Parlez-moi de
votre relation avec eux.
On fait partie de la chorale.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Soit il a volť de la drogue,
ou il doit du fric.
Il y a beaucoup
de drogue ŗ Oswald ?
Dťfinissez "beaucoup".
Combien de personnes prennent
de l'hťroÔne de faÁon rťguliŤre ?
Je sais pas.
Une sur deux, une sur trois,
une sur 20 ?
Je sais pas.
OK, et le sexe ?
C'est une offre ?
C'est Áa.
Beaucoup de relations
homosexuelles ?
Par homosexuelles,
vous entendez le grand amour
entre deux hommes,
ou deux mecs qui s'enculent ?
- Des mecs qui s'enculent.
- «a arrive.
- Et les autoritťs ?
- Ils font la gueule,
et ils font leur possible
pour l'arrÍter.
- Comme pour la drogue.
- Oui.
- Et vous l'avez fait ?
- De quoi ?
Enculer un mec ?
Vous faire enculer ?
Si je l'avais fait, pourquoi
je vous le dirais ?
- Tobias Beecher.
- Eh bien ?
A vous de me le dire.
On chante ensemble
dans la chorale.
Cette camťra me rend tellement
nerveux, je peux pas battre.
Donne-moi les cartes.
Je ressemble ŗ quoi ?
A toi.
Oh, merde.
Quand je suis passť ŗ la tťlť
aprŤs mon ťvasion,
j'ťtais vraiment affreux.
Ma peau ťtait grise.
Je cherche des infos sur les relations
entre Tobias Beecher
- et Vernon Schillinger...
- Foutez-moi la paix !
OK, du calme, Busmalis. Venez,
parlons ŗ quelqu'un d'autre.
- Allez, allez, allez.
- On va par lŗ.
C'est super.
Maintenant toute l'Amťrique
va savoir que tu es un connard.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Cette salope de la tťlť m'a posť plein
de questions. Tu lui as dit quoi ?
Dťgage de lŗ.
Si tu lui dis quoi
que ce soit sur nous,
si tu lui dis quoi que ce soit
sur n'importe quoi...
Eh ben quoi, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que tu feras ?
Fouille !
A plus.
- Il se passe quoi ?
- Ta gueule, connard.
Dťgage de lŗ.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai lŗ ?
Allez, Briggs, je te traÓne au trou.
Je pense que je prends
de la drogue parce que...
je sais que c'est destructeur.
Je ne pense pas
mťriter l'amour.
- Oh, bon sang, quelle connerie.
- Tobias.
Regardez-le : tout sincŤre et mignon
parce qu'ils sont lŗ.
- Keller n'est qu'un acteur.
- Ta gueule, Beecher.
Ta gueule, Beecher.
Tu g‚ches tout pour tout le monde.
Ah ouais, O'Reily ? Vous Ítes
copains-copains, toi et Keller.
«a a commencť quand ?
Quand qui est mort ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu racontes, hein ?!
- «a suffit maintenant !
…teignez cette camťra.
Tout de suite.
Tout de suite ! …teignez-la !
Tobias Beecher
et Christopher Keller.
- Eh bien ?
- Il y a beaucoup de ressentiment.
Il y a eu beaucoup de dťg‚ts.
Pourquoi ?
Les hommes d'Oz
sont en ťtat de dťtresse...
mentalement, physiquement
et moralement.
Christopher Keller est
un prťdateur sexuel, par exemple.
«a rentre en compte
dans ses problŤmes avec Beecher ?
Vous savez,
je ne me sens pas ŗ l'aise
avec le fait de parler
prťcisťment de ces cas.
OK.
On vous a dťjŗ harcelťe ?
Un prisonnier vous a dťjŗ
menacťe sexuellement ?
Non.
Non.
Eh, tu vas faire quoi
avec Beecher ?
- "Faire" ?
- Tu l'as entendu en thťrapie.
Il nous a presque dťnoncťs pour
le meurtre de Shemin et Browne.
Il s'amuse.
Il ne l‚cherait jamais le morceau.
- T'en es sŻr ?
- C'est une preuve d'amour.
Vous Ítes vraiment
cinglťs vous deux.
N'esquinte pas
Beecher, O'Reily.
- Si tu l'esquintes, je t'esquinte.
- Ne me menace pas, lopette.
«a pourrait m'ťnerver.
Vern, regardez-la.
- Pas mon type.
- Votre type ?
Elle a une chatte, non ?
Ouais, et tu risques pas
de t'en approcher.
L'unitť B est un bloc
de cellules typique.
- Il y a combien d'unitťs comme Áa ?
- Euh, 10.
- Eh, Vern, c'est ton tour.
- Lui ? Et moi ?
J'ai de bonnes histoires.
- Ah ouais ?
- Ouais.
- Plus tard peut-Ítre.
- Allez, par ici.
Donc, vous Ítes un dťfenseur
de la race blanche ?
Vous les gens des mťdias...
vous aimez mettre des ťtiquettes.
Je sais que quoi que je dise,
vous allez le manipuler pour
me faire passer pour un monstre.
Mais je ne suis pas un monstre.
Je suis un veuf...
dont le premier nť
est mort tragiquement.
Je vais Ítre grand-pŤre.
Je crois en la famille...
en l'Amťrique...
en Dieu.
- «a vous semble diabolique ?
- Votre autre fils,
Hank,
a ťtť accusť du rapt des enfants
de Tobias Beecher
et du meurtre de son fils, Gary.
Le FBI pense que
vous avez organisť le crime.
«a, Áa me semble
assez diabolique.
Madame, ne vous faites
pas d'opinions
sur des choses que
vous ne pouvez pas comprendre.
Si je ne savais pas que
vous ťtiez un citoyen modŤle,
je pourrais prendre Áa
pour une menace.
Eh, j'ai un truc ŗ dire.
Schillinger est une tartouze.
Eh, assis.
Ta gueule, sale nŤgre.
Eh, arrÍtez de filmer !
Continuez ! Continuez !
- Continuez !
- Dťgagez, dťgagez !
Dťgagez, c'est Áa.
- L'histoire de Beecher tient debout ?
- Oh oui.
Moins ils en disent, mieux c'est.
Il faut en savoir plus.
On donne un matricule et
une photo ŗ chaque prisonnier
puis on les envoie
dans leur unitť.
- Et White va ŗ Em City, c'est Áa ?
- Malheureusement pour nous.
Voilŗ ton doux foyer.
Allez, on y va.
Yo.
T'es ťclopť ou quoi ?
Non, je suis handicapť moteur.
- T'as de la came ?
- Non.
Je ne fais plus dans la drogue.
- T'es pas pťdť au moins ?
- Non !
Dieu merci.
Je supporte pas les pťdťs.
Ils me rendent dingue.
- Et maintenant ?
- Bonne nuit, les petits.
Extinction des feux !
- Eh.
- Le quart ťtat est parti ?
- Oui, pour aujourd'hui.
- Des problŤmes ?
Une petite embrouille ŗ Em City
et une baston dans l'unitť B.
- Ils ont tout filmť ?
- Oh oui.
- Nos gars ont rťagi ?
- Les incidents ont fini en un ťclair.
Je me fous des prisonniers mais
je ne veux pas qu'on ait l'air de cons.
Elle a surtout l'air
de s'intťresser ŗ Beecher.
- Faut faire gaffe avec lui.
- Espťrons qu'elle ne fouille pas trop.
Je ne voudrais pas qu'elle dťcouvre
des vieux cadavres.
Comme Adebisi ?
Entre autres.
La tťlť est un mťdiocre mťdia.
C'est mon oncle Bilbo qui a dit Áa.
OK, quelqu'un l'a dit avant lui,
mais mon oncle fut
le premier ŗ me le dire.
Ne me mťprenez pas,
j'adore regarder les infos ŗ la tťlť...
Dan, Tom et Peter
et un peu Jim Lehrer
si je suis dans une phase intello.
Je zappe entre toutes les infos
en espťrant entendre
la mÍme histoire,
parce que chaque chaÓne raconte
la mÍme histoire diffťremment.
ABC oublie un dťtail
dont CBS fait
toute une histoire.
CBS interviewe son expert
qui est en dťsaccord total
avec l'expert de NBC.
NBC va en profondeur,
alors que ABC raconte
la mÍme histoire en cinq secondes.
Vous voyez, je me dis que
si je vois les trois versions,
peut-Ítre que j'obtiens
un peu de vťritť.
Dťcompte !
88P728.
96J522.
98A498.
92M220.
Eh, eh, mon gars.
Mon gars, aide-moi.
Allez, quoi. Tu me connais.
Pourquoi tu me traites comme Áa ?
Omar, mon gars.
Bon sang, t'as l'air
crispť, mon frŤre.
- Il me faut de la came.
- Oh.
Tu sais, c'est rude en ce moment.
Les gardes,
ils font leur boulot
pour pas que Áa rentre ŗ Oz.
Le truc, c'est que tu dois
connaÓtre la bonne personne.
Passe une bonne journťe.
Hep, hep, hep.
J'ai parlť ŗ tous les nŤgres ici.
Ils croient que je suis des stups.
- Putain, il me connaissent pas. Je...
- Eh, chut.
Abracadabra.
Tu veux quoi en ťchange ?
Je te prťviens,
je vais pas te sucer.
Eh, je suis pas
un sale pťdť.
J'aurais peut-Ítre besoin que
tu rŤgles certaines affaires pour moi.
- C'est tout.
- «a pose pas de problŤme.
Eclate-toi.
Hypocrisie. Hypo-crisie.
C'est tout ce que c'est.
Ils me retirent
mes vÍtements, mes droits,
ils me retirent mon honneur.
Parce que j'ai soi-disant enfreint
la loi... trafic de clandestins.
Mais eux... ils sont
plus coupables que moi.
Ces enculťs de gros pontes.
Ils veulent pas de nous ici.
Adebisi qui chantait, qui ronflait.
Et quand son sang a coulť,
quand son sang s'est ťparpillť,
la vťritť s'est rťpandue,
et on a construit un mur
de mensonges.
Quand Said l'a butť, les gardiens ont
fait comme s'il n'avait jamais existť.
Et les mensonges ont ťtť
enterrťs avec son matricule.
- Vous parlez de dissimulation ?
- Ouais.
Des draps et des couvertures... assez
pour recouvrir les gros pontes.
- Le directeur aussi ?
- Surtout le directeur !
- Allez, Áa suffit.
- Vous voyez ?
Ils essaient encore
de me faire taire.
- Vous avez des preuves ?
- Ouais.
Ouais, il y a une vidťo.
Adebisi, il a fait un reportage,
comme vous ici.
Vous voyez ce que je veux dire ?
Jusqu'au fondu au noir.
Demandez ŗ O'Reily,
demandez ŗ Said, demandez...
- Allez, tais-toi. On y va.
- Laissez-le parler.
Il a toujours quelque chose ŗ dire.
Allez, on y va.
- Hypocrisie !
- Ouais, c'est Áa.
- Conspiration !
- C'est Áa.
Fais une sieste.
Jack...
j'ai une histoire.
Je n'ai pas encore
tous les dťtails,
mais il y a un truc autour
de la mort d'un dťtenu.
Oui, et bien sŻr
c'est sur vidťo.
Le plus tŰt sera le mieux.
- Agent Murphy...
- Vous adorerez les condamnťs ŗ mort.
A la place, je veux retourner
interviewer deux prisonniers.
OK.
- Et en privť.
- En privť ?
- Sans vous.
- Jamais de la vie.
Ne vous en faites pas,
j'obtiendrai la permission.
Elle a demandť ŗ revoir Said
et O'Reily ? Elle leur veut quoi ?
Murphy pense que c'est en rapport
avec la mort d'Adebisi.
- Mais O'Reiley n'a rien a voir avec Áa.
- Je sais.
- Maman me manque.
- A moi aussi.
Pourquoi elle est morte, Ryan ?
Je te l'ai dit cent fois.
Le cancer l'a tuťe.
Eh, Miss Sally passe ŗ la tťlť.
Va regarder, OK ?
S'il te plaÓt ?
- D'accord.
- OK.
Comment Áa va, cousin ?
- Il me faut encore de la dope.
- Ehhh.
J'ai pas une rťserve
infinie, tu sais ?
Juste un peu, jusqu'ŗ ce que
j'aille mieux, tu sais ?
Tu sais, c'est dommage que
tu sois arrivť maintenant.
Il y a six mois,
la dope nous sortait du cul.
Quand Adebisi ťtait
chargť des opťrations,
- le puit n'ťtait jamais ŗ sec.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
Il s'est fait plantť.
Mais lŗ n'est pas la question.
Quand il est mort,
les chicanos et les ritals
ont pris le contrŰle.
Et entre toi, moi et ce lavabo,
ils font du boulot de merde.
- Pourquoi mes frŤres ne font rien ?
- Ils devraient.
Ils leur faut un leader.
Lŗ, ils n'ont que cet abruti de Poet.
- C'est qu'une petite merde.
- Je sais, j'ťtais le chef de ma citť.
Eh ben voilŗ. Tu devrais
prendre le dessus.
- Hein ?
- Ouais.
Viens lŗ.
- Prends-en.
- Putain, merci.
Pour se faire remarquer ici,
- il faut faire un gros truc.
- Gros ?
Ouais, comme Adebisi.
Il ťtait gros et c'ťtait le boss,
plus gros que tous
et craint par tous.
Ouais, c'est ce que je veux.
Qu'ils me craignent.
Alors tu dois tuer quelqu'un,
mais pas n'importe qui.
Quelqu'un de trŤs important...
d'immense.
Quelqu'un...
- de connu.
- Comme qui ?
OK, suivant ?
Avancez, madame.
Avancez, ouvrez votre sac.
Suivant !
Mettez vos objets mťtalliques ici.
Vous venez voir... ?
Peter Thorpe.
Repassez. Et vous Ítes...
- Helen Keating.
- Et... la montre.
Vous croyez que j'essaie de faire
passer un putain de bazooka ?
Oh, pouvez-vous, s'il vous plaÓt...
Tom, c'est bon,
laisse-le entrer.
Oh, fallait le dire.
Je suis un grand fan.
Ouais. Oh, oh ! Rťveil.
- Jack ?
- Oui ?
- Voici Ryan O'Reily.
- OK.
- Jack Eldridge.
- Enchantť.
Bonjour. Vous ne vous
souvenez pas de moi,
- n'est-ce pas ?
- Non. On se connaÓt ?
- Il y a 20 ans.
- Vous devez comprendre, alors.
Vous devez rencontrer tellement
de gens dans ce travail.
- Quelles ťtaient les circonstances ?
- C'est pas important.
- OK, Ryan. A l'aise ?
- Oui.
Moteur.
Oý ťtiez-vous quand
Adebisi est mort ?
- La salle commune.
- On pouvait prťsager quelque chose ?
Non, non. Autant que je sache,
Said et Adebisi,
ils s'entendaient assez bien.
Expliquez-moi
ce qui s'est passť.
- Vous ťtiez dans la salle commune...
- A ne rien faire.
Et ?
J'ai entendu du bruit venant
de la cellule d'Adebisi...
et il avait des rideaux blancs
qui pendouillaient et pouf...
tout est devenu rouge sang
et alors Adebisi,
il tombe hors de la cellule,
sur le sol, mort,
et Said le suit
avec la tige dans la main.
- Vous connaissez le mobile ?
- Non.
OK.
Il y avait donc des rideaux
aux fenÍtres de la cellule.
- C'est inhabituel ?
- Oui.
- …tait-ce un privilŤge d'Adebisi ?
- Un privilŤge ?
Il avait des choses que les autres
ne pouvaient pas avoir ?
Attendez une seconde.
Excusez-moi.
On peut arrÍter ?
Bien sŻr.
Dell, les gars, coupez.
Quel est le problŤme ?
- Pour Áa, il faudra payer.
- On ne paye pas les informateurs.
- Alors, je n'ai rien ŗ dire.
- Ryan, avant de filmer
- vous avez dit que vous diriez tout.
- Je vais le payer.
Le dirlo va me coller au cul
comme une sonde anale.
- Je veux juste une compensation.
- Non ! Foutez le camp.
TrŤs bien, M. Eldridge.
Ce fut un plaisir
de vous revoir.
Enfoirť.
Trouve d'oý je le connais.
- Comment Áa ?
- Utilise ton cerveau !
Je ne l'ai certainement pas
connu ŗ une soirťe huppťe.
J'ai dŻ faire un reportage sur lui.
Trouve-le !
Un travail admirable, chťrie.
Superbe putain d'interview.
Un plaisir de vous rencontrer enfin.
- Je suis un admirateur.
- Merci.
C'est respectif.
J'ai lu vos deux livres.
En fait, il y en a trois.
J'ai toujours pensť
que vos convictions
ťtaient politiquement motivťes.
Messieurs ?
Nous sommes prÍts.
OK, dÓtes ce que vous pensez.
Imam Said, vous avez tuť
Simon Adebisi.
Non, je, euh...
me suis dťfendu.
Il m'a attaquť avec un couteau.
Pourquoi vous a-t-il attaquť ?
Je croyais que
nous devions parler
des conditions de vie ŗ Oz.
Ce n'en est pas une ?
La brutalitť, la violence gratuite ?
Son assaut ťtait sans motif ?
Non.
Vous avez dŻ dire
ou faire quelque chose.
Je suis musulman.
Je n'approuvais pas entiŤrement
la faÁon dont Adebisi
se comportait.
Pourquoi avez-vous demandť
ŗ emmťnager avec Adebisi ?
J'ai en ma possession
un document
que vous avez signť
demandant le changement.
Si vous dťtestiez
autant Adebisi...
- Je n'ai pas dit Áa.
- Pourquoi vivre avec un tel animal ?
J'essayais de le sauver.
Et cependant, vous l'avez tuť.
Et la vidťo documentant
la conduite d'Adebisi ?
Vous savez, je voudrais plutŰt
changer de conversation
et parler de plus
grands problŤmes.
Vous niez qu'il y ait une vidťo ?
Chaque jour, nous subissons
d'abus des droits civils
fondamentaux.
La cassette, monsieur,
oui ou non ?
J'ai terminť.
Imam, nous ne cherchons
que les faits.
Cette histoire est terminťe.
Vous ne comprenez pas ?
Adebisi est mort.
Adebisi ne compte pas.
Un homme mort ne compte pas.
Vous voulez que nous ťcoutions
ce que vous voulez dire, bien.
Vous devez d'abord nous dire
ce que nous voulons savoir.
Et vous diffuserez
quelle partie ?
Ils travaillent
sur l'angle Adebisi.
Sa mort ?
Non, ce qui s'est passť avant.
Poet leur a parlť
des vidťos d'Adebisi.
Merde.
Oui, et ils essaient de vťrifier
qu'elles existent.
- On devrait tout arrÍter.
- Je ne peux pas.
J'ai parlť au prťfet
et au gouverneur
et ils pensent que si on arrÍte,
les choses vont s'empirer.
Et vu que je ne leur ai pas
parlť des vidťos...
je ne peux pas de leur
en parler maintenant.
Peut-Ítre qu'il va le falloir.
La vťritť va
peut-Ítre devoir sortir.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Vous avez des infos pour moi ?
Je ne peux pas dire ce qui doit
Ítre dit devant une camťra.
Pourquoi pas ?
Parce que ce serait la fin
de la carriŤre de Leo
et le gouverneur aurait
assez de munitions
pour fermer Emerald City
dťfinitivement.
OK.
Qu'est-ce que
vous pourriez dire ?
Devant une camťra, rien.
Mais si vous voulez fouiller...
Le gars que vous cherchez
est Martin Querns.
Il a dirigť Emerald City
aprŤs vous.
Et la vidťo ?
Vous l'avez vue ?
Et Glynn ?
Allez. Racontez-moi.
Vous me demandez
de trahir un ami.
Un ami ?
Il vous a virť.
Avec de bonnes raisons.
Et il m'a rendu Em City.
Comme j'ai dit,
cherchez Querns.
Leo, il se passe quoi, merde ?
On m'a demandť
si je voulais bien
Ítre interviewť par ce putain
de Jack Eldridge ?
Ils savent ce qui s'est passť quand
vous vous occupiez d'Em City.
- Ils ont entendu parler des vidťos.
- Merde.
Vous m'aviez dit qu'on connaÓtrait pas
la raison de mon dťpart,
que tout resterait interne
pour nous protťger tous les deux.
Refusez de faire l'interview,
comme moi.
OK.
Oý sont les vidťos ?
Dans un endroit sŻr.
Pourquoi les garder ?
Dťtruisez-les, Leo.
Dťtruisez ces putains
de vidťos tout de suite !
M. le directeur.
M. Eldridge.
Vous avez annulť
notre interview.
- C'est exact.
- Puis-je vous demander pourquoi ?
Oui, mais je ne rťpondrai pas.
Allez, en confidence. Entre deux gars
qui tiennent leurs bites.
Quand j'ťtais candidat
au gouverneur adjoint,
j'ai passť trop de temps
devant les camťras.
Entre nous,
en toute confidence,
ce sont des conneries.
- Vous Ítes ici depuis quand ?
- Trop longtemps.
«a vous ennuierait
de partir, non ?
Dťmissionner ?
Devoir partir ŗ cause
de quelques indiscrťtions ?
Parce qu'on parlerait
de certaines erreurs ŗ la tťlť ?
J'ai passť ma vie
ŗ punir des gens,
et au fil des ans, j'ai eu
ŗ prendre des dťcisions,
parfois bonnes, d'autres
ayant conduit ŗ la violence.
Des vies ont ťtť perdues et je...
je me demande si j'aurais
pu arrÍter le carnage.
Simon Adebisi...
vous auriez pu
empÍcher sa mort ?
Oui.
Pour Ítre honnÍte,
je devrais Ítre virť.
Mais j'ai bien peur
que mon remplaÁant
ne pourrait que faire pire.
C'est terrible
d'atteindre ce point
et de rťaliser que votre vie
entiŤre n'est qu'une imposture.
Pour un homme dont la vie
est de punir les autres,
vous semblez vous punir
plus que les autres.
En toute confidence ?
Oui.
Pas de commentaires.
Lisa.
Quoi ?
- L'histoire Adebisi est une impasse.
- Quoi ? Jack, non.
Mon instinct me dit que
personne ne donnera les faits.
On a vu pire. Je peux
faire craquer McManus.
Plein de gens ici agissent
pour des raisons malveillantes.
Pas Leo Glynn. Il est imparfait,
pas incompťtent.
Il n'y a pas de raison de cacher
ce qui s'est passť.
- Un homme est mort.
- Ouais, un homme mauvais.
Quoi, sa vie n'ťtait pas aussi
importante celle du Pape ?
Me fais pas ce numťro. J'ai fait
s'agenouiller des prťsidents,
des tueurs en sťrie,
des gťants de corporations.
- Et maintenant vous jouez le sensible ?
- Je rentre chez moi.
Je dois me reposer
pour demain.
C'est une putain d'erreur
de laisser filer cette histoire !
Probablement, mais une fois
de temps en temps,
mÍme un journaliste a un cúur.
Je peux avoir votre autographe,
M. Brokaw ?
Connard.
Le journaliste est
censť Ítre impartial.
Il est censť garder
son opinion personnelle.
A la tťlť, on sait ce que
le journaliste pense.
On voit Sam Donaldson
ou Andrea Mitchell
nous donner les faits,
mais avec un gros
plan de camťra,
on peut aussi dire
par un sourcil levť,
une lťgŤre inflexion,
ce qu'ils pensent vraiment
de la personne dont ils parlent.
Walter Cronkite ťtait
un vrai joueur de poker.
Personne n'a jamais su
ce que Walt pensait.
Alors qu'il disait la vťritť,
il mentait aussi ŗ la camťra.
«a, c'est du gťnie !
Eh, eh, eh, O'Reily,
O'Reily, mon pote.
Eh, j'ai oubliť de te remercier
pour m'avoir fait entrer ŗ la cafťtťria.
C'est trop de la balle.
Pas de problŤme.
Eh, viens voir.
J'ai un truc pour toi.
Les vitamines du matin.
C'est de la bonne. Ouais.
Alors, Omar, il paraÓt que
t'es le chanceux connard
qui va passer la nuit en cellule
avec Jack Eldridge.
Je vais Ítre une star, putain,
comme... Martin Lawrence
ou Bart Simpson.
C'est de la bonne.
Prends-en encore.
Tu sais, j'espŤre
qu'il va te respecter,
c'est tout.
Quoi ? Comment Áa ?
Je l'ai entendu dire
ŗ quelqu'un hier
- que t'ťtais une pťdale.
- Ouais ?
Ouais, c'est ce qu'il a dit.
- Une pťdale ?
- Ouais.
- Je suis pas une putain de pťdale !
- Omar, Omar, Omar !
Je le sais,
mais tu connais
ces connards des mťdias,
ils adorent dťformer les trucs.
Ils se foutent pas mal
de la vťritť.
Ils montrent un gars
comme ils le veulent
pour leur histoire,
pour l'audimat.
L'audimat ?
J'emmerde le putain d'audimat.
- Cet enfoirť me traite de pťdale !
- Mais le truc marrant, c'est que
les tabloÔdes disent
qu'Eldridge est une pťdale.
J'ai entendu Áa quelque part.
Il est dans le placard.
Mais pour couvrir sa honte,
- il va te baiser ŗ la tťlť nationale.
- Non.
- Eh, O'Reily ?
- Oui ?
- Les oeufs se cuisent pas tout seuls.
- J'arrive.
- OK, allez.
- Je sais, j'arrive.
Si j'ťtais toi,
ce soir, tout seul
avec ce pťdť,
je lui montrerais ce que c'est
qu'Ítre un homme.
Eclate-toi.
- Bonjour, bonjour.
- M. Eldridge.
Bonjour, Lisa.
Jack.
T'as trouvť quoi
sur Ryan O'Reily ?
Quand il avait 16 ans,
vous avez travaillť sur les gangs,
comment les gosses noirs gagnaient
du terrain sur les blancs,
- surtout les Irlandais.
- J'ai interviewť O'Reily ?
Oui, et son frŤre, Cyril.
Voici le texte.
Lisa.
J'ai pas le temps. Jack a-t-il montrť
O'Reily sous un mauvais jour ?
J'ai regardť la cassette
hier soir et oui...
les O'Reily sont montrťs
comme brutaux, impitoyables.
Je veux voir cette cassette.
Allez, on y va.
Attention ŗ la peinture.
A 17h00, les prisonniers sont bouclťs.
A 21h00, extinction des feux.
- Jusqu'ŗ... ?
- 6h00.
Oh, <i>mamac</i>/<i>ta.</i>
Mets-toi la derriŤre l'oreille.
Tu la fumeras plus tard !
Putain.
Le voilŗ. Le connard.
- Omar, attends ce soir.
- Cette salope est ŗ moi.
Eh, Omar !
- Attends, attends, attends.
- Fous le camp.
Eh, eh, eh ! Eh, toi !
Connard.
- Fils de pute.
- C'est quoi ton problŤme ?
- Je t'attends, OK ?
- C'est quoi, ton problŤme ?
C'est lui mon problŤme !
J'ai un autre problŤme, OK ?
«a ! C'est mon putain
de problŤme !
Eh, du calme.
Du calme, White,
laisse tomber.
Merde ! Il a un couteau.
Chef, ici Agent 11,
on a un 66 sur les bras !
Mineo, sale connard,
t'en reveux ?
Baisse cette tige !
Allez, petite pute !
Viens, je vais te baiser la gueule !
Fils de pute !
Fils de pute !
Fils de pute !
Putain.
C'est pour Áa que
je ne voulais pas de vous.
Vous devriez
au minimum repousser.
Non, repousser,
c'est annuler.
Nous nous soucions
de votre sťcuritť, M. Eldridge.
J'ai jouť ce jeu assez longtemps.
Je peux prendre soin de moi.
Donc, on continue ?
Vous allez dormir dans une cellule ?
Oui, mais il faut quelqu'un
pour aller avec Jack.
Vous pourriez prendre
une cellule tout seul.
Ted Koppel l'a fait pour "Nightline".
C'ťtait de la merde.
- Qui alors ?
- J'ai lu les dossiers des O'Reily.
Le plus jeune, Cyril.
Il a des lťsions cťrťbrales
et est sous mťdicaments
pour contrŰler ses actions.
C'est lui que je veux.
Je ne veux pas que mon frŤre
soit impliquť, OK ? Je refuse.
O'Reily, on n'a pas le choix.
On laisse passer la nuit
et on prie pour le mieux.
Vous savez quoi ? Priez.
Utilisez tout le rosaire.
Vous avez testť la camťra ?
- Deux fois. C'est bon.
- OK.
- Bouclez-moi.
- Vous ne voulez pas des secours ?
Non, je veux que ce soit
une nuit typique.
C'est parti.
Bonjour, Cyril.
Je suis Jack Eldridge.
Bonjour.
Jack, vous Ítes prÍt ?
C'est parti.
Il est 17h00 et dťjŗ...
Il n'est que 17h00,
mais les prisonniers
d'Emerald City sont
dťjŗ bouclťs pour la nuit.
Deux dans une piŤce vide,
ŗ l'exception de deux lits,
un ťvier et des toilettes.
La piŤce fait la taille moyenne
d'une salle de bain amťricaine
et sent pareil.
Imaginez-vous passer
le restant de votre vie
enfermť avec un ťtranger
dans votre salle de bain.
Vous parlez ŗ qui ?
A cette camťra que j'aimerais
que vous ignoriez.
Ce soir, nous sommes
ŗ la prison d'Oswald.
Jack, bougez un peu ŗ gauche.
Vous le cachez. Bien.
- Que faites-vous avant l'extinction ?
- J'attends.
- Quoi donc ?
- L'extinction des feux.
Venez par ici.
Et ensuite ?
Je fais ma priŤre et je dors.
Et vous priez pour quoi ?
Oh, je prie Jťsus...
que Ryan soit sauf,
et Tata Brenda,
et que Papa sourie...
et qu'ils prennent soin
de Maman au Paradis.
Votre mŤre est morte ?
Il y a plusieurs annťes,
ŗ l'hŰpital.
Je dťteste les hŰpitaux.
Je dťteste
l'odeur des hŰpitaux.
- Et les mťdicaments ont mauvais goŻt.
- Oui.
Ryan me dit de prendre
mes mťdicaments,
mais parfois je ne les prends pas,
comme aujourd'hui.
Et, euh...
avant l'accident ?
Vous vous souvenez
de quelque chose ?
Des images de temps en temps...
comme maintenant...
je vous vois...
et je pense que
je vous connais.
On s'est rencontrťs.
Vous aviez 15 ans.
Vous et votre frŤre, nous avons
parlť de vos vies dans le gang.
Vous avez rendu maman triste.
Vous avez fait pleurer maman.
Vous avez donnť le cancer
ŗ ma maman.
Merde !
Chef, ici 11. On a un 66.
Ryan a dit sur sa tombe
que vous lui avez donnť le cancer.
Non !
Cyril !
Vous avez donnť le cancer
ŗ ma maman !
Cyril !
Vous avez donnť le cancer
ŗ ma maman !
Cyril !
Cyril !
Cyril !
Maman !
Ryan !
Cyril !
Jack ! Jack ! Jack !
- Oh, Jack !
- Est-ce que... Lisa, est-ce que...
- Quoi ? Quoi ?
- T'as tout filmť ?
La tťlťvision a le pouvoir
d'ťclairer, d'informer,
d'exposer la vťritť
aux yeux du public.
La tťlťvision est
un cadeau extraordinaire.
Tout autant un miracle
de Dieu que Lazare...
ressuscitant des morts.
Mais utilisons-nous
ce cadeau sagement ?
L'avons-nous jamais fait ?
Le journaliste Jack Eldridge est devenu
une partie de son histoire hier,
dans ce que l'industrie a appelť
un retour de flamme d'audimat.
Le meurtrier condamnť
Cyril O'Reily
a brutalement battu Eldridge,
causant au journaliste
une contusion sťvŤre, quatre cŰtes
cassťes et un poumon perforť.
Il est au Benchley Memorial
dans un ťtat critique.
Malgrť les objections de
la productrice d'Eldridge, Lisa Logan,
la chaÓne a dťcidť de ne pas
diffuser ce qui devait Ítre
une sťrie en trois parties
sur la prison de sťcuritť
maximum d'Oswald.
Logan, qui a gagnť
un Emmy et un Peabody
a dťmissionnť pour protester.
Nous souhaitons tous ŗ Jack
un prompt rťtablissement.
On est tous élevés pour croire
en une certaine version de la vérité,
sur Dieu, la moralité, la mortalité,
sur le but de la vie.
On appelle ces croyances
la religion.
Et si au cours de la vie,
ces croyances s'effondrent,
si elles s'avèrent fausses,
on cherche une nouvelle religion
à suivre et on se convertit.
Cette conversion peut être
traumatisante,
pour nous-mêmes, nos âmes,
et pour ceux qui nous entourent.
Je peux avoir votre attention ?
Votre attention, tout le monde !
Dans mon effort permanent
d'améliorer la qualité de vos vies,
je vais mettre en place
deux nouveaux programmes.
Une fois par semaine,
nous allons vous montrer
une vidéo éducative
d'une demi-heure.
Oui, oui.
Et vous allez être obligés
de la regarder.
Eh, je veux du silence.
Mon autre idée est là-bas.
Quand vous enfreindrez les règles,
au lieu de vous envoyer au trou,
on vous mettra dans cette cage
exposée devant vos admirateurs.
- Des questions ?
- Oui, M. McManus.
Vous avez un gros pénis ?
Très drôle. Keller,
tu as l'honneur d'être
la première limace de cette cage.
- Keller !
- Bien joué !
Pédale.
Eh, t'as besoin de chier ?
Eh, les gars, c'est pas si mal.
Tous les autres,
asseyez-vous.
Voici la première vidéo.
C'est parti.
La vie est comme une maison.
On peut la peindre et la décorer seul,
mais vous serez le seul à l'apprécier.
Pas les autres.
Ce n'est pas ce que vous voulez ?
C'est ce qu'est une communauté.
- Eh, tu t'en vas ?
- Ouais.
Va dire à Emerald City que
Supreme Allah n'a pas fini.
T'entends ? Dis-leur qu'il va revenir
et en pleine forme.
- Du calme, Ketchum.
- Le pacte du meurtre. Dis-leur.
- Avance.
- Je t'ai fait sortir d'isolement
parce que tu as dit
que tu voulais changer.
Je te donne cette chance, Omar,
et je vais faire ce que je peux
pour t'aider.
- Mais il faut que t'arrêtes la drogue.
- Ok.
Si tu déconnes, je te renvoie
direct en isolement.
C'est clair ?
Oui.
Ok.
Putain, il a dit que j'abusais
de la drogue.
J'abuse pas de la drogue, Jack.
En fait, je traite mes drogues
mieux que la plupart.
Il veut que j'aille
en désintoxication.
C'est cool comme truc.
Tu parles beaucoup de toi.
Je vais faire...
entre 17 et perpétuité ?
Quand je sortirai de cette taule,
y'aura plus rien à récupérer.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Miguel Alavarez, un fugitif
de la Prison d'Oswald
depuis ces six mois derniers
a été capturé.
Des douaniers
près de Nogales, Arizona,
ont trouvé Alavarez
la nuit dernière
alors qu'il essayait de franchir
la frontière du Mexique.
- Une autre information...
- Alavarez est de retour.
- Et ?
- Ce connard a essayé de me tuer.
Ouais, parce que t'avais essayé
de le tuer.
Ou j'ai pas bien compris l'histoire.
Laisse tomber, Chico.
Comment ça va, Glynn ?
J'vous ai manqué ?
Non.
Vous savez, j'y étais presque.
J'étais presque au Mexique.
On t'aurait quand même trouvé.
Je ne crois pas.
Je serais allé au Guatemala,
au Nicaragua, en Colombie,
j'aurais traversé les Andes
jusqu'au Chili
pour finir à la Terre de Feu.
Vous connaissez la Terre de Feu ?
- C'est le bout de la Terre.
- Exactement.
Vous seriez allé jusque là
pour me capturer ?
Jusqu'au bout de la Terre ?
Probablement pas.
La prochaine fois.
Mettez-le en isolement.
Alors, quoi de neuf ?
Avance.
- C'est qui ce type ?
- Qu'est-ce que ça peut te faire ?
J'aime connaître la qualité
de mes voisins criminels.
C'est qu'un branleur,
comme toi.
Merde.
- Ajoute un truc à la bouffe d'Alvarez.
- Comme quoi ?
Je sais pas, de la mort au rat,
par exemple.
Écoute, Omar, si tu le tues,
tu auras toute la came
dont t'as besoin.
Hein ? Qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
- Non.
- Non ? Pourquoi ?
C'est juste que je t'aime pas.
Tu m'aimes pas ?
J'arrive pas y à mettre
le doigt dessus.
Je sais pas si c'est ta tronche...
ton odeur, ton haleine,
la façon dont tu parles.
Je sais pas, mais il y a un truc
chez toi qui me dérange.
Ah ouais ? Eh ben,
va te faire foutre, négro.
Oh, merde !
- Ok.
- Appelez le directeur !
- Ok.
- Ne résiste pas.
Non ! Non ! Aidez-moi !
On a un 66 dans la cuisine,
un code 66.
- Te revoilà ?
- Ouais.
Putain, négro,
t'as dû battre un record.
- T'es Alvarez ?
- Ouais.
Tu m'en dois une !
Entre.
- Claire ?
- Ouais ?
- Tu m'aimes à quel point ?
- Vachement.
- Tu ferais n'importe quoi pour moi ?
- Ouais.
Ouais ? T'es super. Allez.
Attends deux seconds.
- T'as baisé Howell ?
- Ouais.
Tu lâches pas une info comme ça
sans détails, O'Reily.
On a baisé genre cinq fois
dans les chiottes des dames.
Elle est devenue bizarre.
- Bizarre ? Genre, possessive ?
- Ouais.
Quand McManus est revenu à Em City
et l'a mutée à l'Unité J,
j'ai été plutôt soulagé.
Je ne l'ai pas vraiment revue depuis.
Mon estime pour toi
a grimpé de 69%,
mais dis-moi, d'un connard
manipulateur à un autre,
tu l'as fait pour le sexe ou pour
d'autres trucs dégueulasses ?
Que pour le sexe.
Échec.
Merde.
- Me fais pas de l'œil !
- Quoi ?
- Claire !
- Cet enculé me fait de l'œil.
- Envoie-le au trou !
- C'est des conneries !
Envoie-le au trou.
- Mineo.
- Joe.
Ok, Ok.
- Mais tu remplies la paperasse.
- Mineo.
Quoi ? Sale gouine !
- Ryan, je t'ai manqué ?
- Oh, merde.
- Dr. Nathan, bon retour.
- Merci, contente d'être rentrée.
Oh non, je voulais les mettre
sur ton bureau avant ton arrivée.
Oh, Pete.
- Salut.
- Ouah ! T'as l'air en forme.
- Merci. Je vais bien.
- Oui ?
Prête à me plonger dans le travail
en tête première.
J'ai six secondes
avant la réunion de groupe.
- On étudiera les dossiers plus tard ?
- Ok.
- Bienvenida !
- Gracias.
Dr. Nathan, on a besoin de vous.
- Il s'est prit une tige dans le visage.
- Euh, des gants.
L'autre gars n'a pas eu
autant de chance.
- Cyril O'Reily.
- Je sais ce qu'il a fait au journaliste
Jack Eldridge,
qu'il a presque battu à mort.
L'état de Cyril
ne fait que s'empirer.
On n'arrive pas à trouver
le bon équilibre médicamenteux.
J'aimerais l'examiner.
Ça peut se faire, Tim ?
Bien sûr.
Et le suivant ?
C'est tout.
Ok, je vais à la réunion de groupe.
- Ok, à plus.
- Salut.
T'as prévu quelque chose ?
Tu veux aller dîner ?
Non.
Je ne parlais que d'un dîner.
Je sais. On remet ça, Ok ?
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
Ok, vous pouvez vous rhabiller.
Dr. Nathan,
vous étiez passée où ?
J'ai pris quelques mois
de vacances.
- Après votre viol ?
- Ah, oui.
- J'aurais aimé pouvoir.
- Pouvoir faire quoi ?
Prendre des vacances
après mon viol.
Ça a été quand même.
Ryan m'a aidé.
Oui, il est très secourable.
J'aimerais pouvoir l'aider.
Il est malade.
Quand il était au trou,
il a attrapé froid.
Vous pouvez le ramener.
Putain, O'Reily,
arrête de tousser sur la bouffe.
Tu vas rendre
toute la prison malade.
- Du calme. Je suis plus contagieux.
- Ouais.
Putain.
Eh, au fond...
je ne me sens pas si bien que ça.
Je vais aller à l'infirmerie.
Respirez à fond.
Encore.
Oui, vous êtes congestionné.
Donnez-lui de l'Albuterol.
On le garde cette nuit.
Suivez-moi.
- Ça fait plaisir de te revoir.
- Hein ?
- Ça fait plaisir de te revoir.
- Oh, merci, Claire.
Je voulais juste te dire...
j'ai bien pris soin
de Ryan O'Reily pour toi.
- Comment ça ?
- Je lui ai donné un coup de main.
Retourne te coucher.
Non, Benny, ça va.
Je veux lui parler.
Mais reste dans les parages.
- Ça va mieux ?
- Ouais.
Vous m'avez envoyé ça ?
Oui.
Vous l'avez tué,
non... Keenan ?
Oui.
Vous admettez l'avoir tué
même si vous savez
que je pourrais le dire au directeur
et que vous finiriez exécuté ?
Keenan vous a violée.
Il ne méritait pas de respirer.
Si je dois mourir à cause de ça...
Ok, tuez-moi.
Allez vous coucher.
Je vous aime.
Benny, Carl, on a fini.
Je déteste Ryan O'Reiley
depuis si longtemps...
et si profondément.
Il est responsable de la mort
de mon mari,
mais il l'a fait
par amour pour moi.
Keenan aussi.
Tout ça pour moi.
Il m'aime plus que Preston
ne m'a jamais aimée.
L'amour de Ryan est...
énorme, irrésistible,
inconditionnel, permanent.
Je suis folle
de le repousser ou...
Gloria, écoutes ce que tu dis.
Son amour est tout
sauf inconditionnel,
et bien souvent
tout sauf de l'amour.
Les sentiments qu'il a pour toi
sont dangereux.
Il est dangereux.
Et le fait de l'encourager,
étant donné que tu ne partages pas
ces sentiments...
Mais si.
Je partage ses sentiments.
Mon Dieu, aidez-moi.
Je suis amoureuse
de Ryan O'Reily.
Quand Christophe Colombe
a débarqué sur le Nouveau Monde,
un prêtre catholique
était à ses côtés.
A partir de ce moment, les prêtres
ont afflué sur ce continent
pour convertir les Indiens
et leur faire embrasser le crucifix,
leur faire arrêter de fumer du peyote
et couvrir leur nudité.
Les Indiens ont fait preuve
d'un grand enthousiasme.
Ils ont mutilé, torturé et brûlé
les prêtres...
puis ont offert leurs corps
à leurs propres dieux.
C'est quoi ?
James Devlin va être nominé
gouverneur pour la seconde fois.
Eh, change de chaîne.
Ça ne changera rien.
Ce connard est
sur toutes les chaînes.
Ouais, on devrait demander
au directeur d'installer le câble.
Augustus, il a la même
bagnole que toi.
Regarde moi ça.
Je jure solennellement,
de mener ma mission
de gouverneur
au mieux de mes facultés,
et de préserver,
protéger et défendre
la Constitution de cet État,
avec égalité et justice pour tous.
Que Dieu m'assiste.
Vous aimeriez être à sa place ?
Neil Bourne fera un excellent
assistant gouverneur.
Ce n'est pas
ce que j'ai demandé.
Vous regrettez d'avoir abandonné
les élections ?
- Non.
- Tant mieux.
Monsieur le directeur ?
Barry Levine sur la deux.
- Qui ça ?
- Il dit qu'il vous connaît.
- Barry Levine ?
- Il veut vous parler de la conférence.
Ah, vous voulez dire
Barney Levin ?
Ah oui, c'est peut-être ça.
Dîtes-lui que je le rappellerai.
Et utilisez ce fichu interphone.
Oui, Monsieur.
Bon sang,
Busmalis me rend dingue.
C'est le pire assistant que j'ai eu.
Il se plante avec les numéros
et les rendez-vous,
j'organise la conférence
des directeurs de Prisons,
et il a réussi à tout foirer.
- Prenez un autre prisonnier.
- Qui ?
Vous connaissez des dealers
qui savent utiliser Excel ?
Embauchez quelqu'un
de l'extérieur.
Ils finissent tous
par démissionner.
Ils ont la trouille de travailler ici.
J'ai besoin
de quelqu'un qui soit...
intelligent, drôle, diplomate...
et intrépide.
Je connais peut-être la personne
qu'il vous faut.
Une femme que j'ai rencontrée
dans un centre pour sans-abri.
Elle s'appelle Floria Mills.
- Je ne suis pas en retard ?
- Non, juste à l'heure.
Ma voiture est tombée en panne
sur la voie express.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
on appelle ça la voie express
parce que ça avance
à une vitesse d'escargot.
Un camionneur m'a prise en stop,
mais on a tellement fait la causette
qu'on a loupé la sortie,
et après il ne voulait pas
venir jusqu'ici.
Il avait fait 4 ans de taule
pour vol à main armée,
il a fallu que je marche, je dois
ressembler à un épouvantail.
Voilà mon CV.
Vous avez toujours
autant d'énergie ?
En fait, je suis plutôt
dans un mauvais jour.
Félicitations, Floria.
- Pour quoi ?
- Vous avez le job.
- C'est vrai ?
- Oui.
Je sais que l'ancien assistant
vous a dit un buffet de 20 personnes,
mais il s'est trompé, j'espère
que vous m'aiderez à changer ça.
Carl, rien n'est impossible.
Le gouverneur va assister
à la conférence.
Vous savez que s'il apprécie
votre cuisine
vous aurez des commandes de l'État
pendant des années.
Merci, Carl.
Vous êtes un amour.
Oui ?
Si vous êtes d'accord,
je vais rentrer chez moi.
Ok. C'était une bonne
première journée.
Merci.
Je me suis bien amusée.
Amusée ?
Ce n'est pas un mot
que j'associerais à Oz.
M. le directeur, vous n'avez jamais
pensé à redécorer ?
- Pas vraiment.
- Eh bien, avec votre permission,
j'aimerais apporter quelques
changements, égayer le tout,
- acheter de nouveaux meubles.
- Ok.
A moins que cela ennuie
votre femme bien sûr.
Je ne la connais pas mais je sais
que certaines épouses
ont leur mot à dire sur le bureau
de leur mari...
Ça ne dérangerait pas Mary,
Floria.
Elle ne semble plus trop se soucier
de ce que je fais.
A vrai dire...
on a décidé
de se séparer ce matin.
Oh, M. le directeur,
je suis vraiment désolée.
Elle m'a demandé
de faire mes valises.
Vous avez quelque part où aller ?
Non, je n'y ai pas réfléchi.
Je vais vous appeler un hôtel.
Il y a un Hyatt au coin de Bartlett
et la Troisième.
C'est pas la peine.
Je vais dormir ici ce soir.
Vous pensez que c'est
une bonne idée ?
Ça peut paraître étrange,
mais...
parfois les murs de Oz
me donnent
un sentiment de sécurité.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
je vous raconte tout ça.
Je ne l'ai dit à personne d'autre.
- Bonne nuit M. le directeur.
- Appelez-moi Leo.
Molo sur la bouteille, Leo.
Le directeur m'a viré.
Pas de merci, pas de tape sur l'épaule,
juste "prenez vos affaires".
- C'est peut-être pour le mieux.
- Pour le mieux ?
Je me suis remit à ramasser la merde,
la pisse et le vomi.
Tu crois que j'aime mon job ?
Répondre aux emails de Miss Sally,
imiter sa signature
sur les photos ?
Ce qui compte c'est qu'on fasse
notre travail du mieux possible.
Norma, tu regardes toujours
les choses du bon côté.
Ces derniers mois,
tes visites ont été
mon rayon de soleil.
Je suis contente, Agamemnon.
Je veux que tu sois heureux.
Quand je suis avec toi,
je suis aux anges.
Je t'aime, Norma.
Veux-tu m'épouser ?
- Oui.
- Oh, mon Dieu.
Je veux que tu sois
mon témoin.
Tu as bien réfléchi ?
Le mariage est une grande étape,
un grand engagement.
Quelle genre de vie
vous allez avoir ?
Avec toi ici et elle dehors ?
Je ne resterai pas à Oz
bien longtemps.
Pendant que tu étais a l'hôpital,
j'ai creusé un autre tunnel.
Toi et moi, mon ami.
On dansera la gigue
à mon mariage.
Saul était un soldat galopant
vers Damas
quand tout à coup, il vit
une immense croix dans le ciel.
Il changea alors la première lettre
de son nom en P, comme Paul.
Pourquoi ? Je ne sais pas.
On n'a pas tous la chance de voir
une croix dans le ciel.
Les signes de Dieu ne sont pas
pour nous tous aussi évidents.
" N'assigne point à Dieu
d'autres divinités,
sinon tu te trouveras méprisé
et abandonné.
Ton Seigneur a décrété
que tu ne serviras d'autre que lui.
Et marquez... "
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- Il faut que je parle à l'Imam Said.
Continue.
"...et la bonté envers ses parents,
- si l'un d'eux ou tous deux... "
- Monsieur l'Imam, s'il vous plaît.
Je veux devenir musulman.
Tidd... vas-t'en.
Je sais qu'avant je traînais
avec Adebisi et tout.
Mais quand je l'ai vu saigner,
et vous avec cette tige à la main,
J'ai su qu'il fallait que je change.
- Je veux me joindre à vous.
- Lève-toi.
- Sauvez-moi, Imam Said.
- J'ai dit, debout !
Eh, que se passe t-il ?
- Cet homme me harcèle.
- Tu fous la merde, Leroy ?
- Non.
- Alors bouge tes fesses de là.
Vous savez que
je n'ai jamais aimé Leroy Tidd.
Ce mec n'a fait que jouer les gros bras
depuis son arrivée à Oz.
- Mais si sa conversion est vraie...
- Ce n'est pas le cas.
Comment en êtes-vous sûr ?
Toi, entre tous les autres,
tu vas mettre en question
ma capacité de juger les autres.
- Toi ?
- Non.
- Vous avez raison.
- Bien.
Et je ne veux plus entendre parler
de Leroy Tidd.
Je suis un monstre.
Je suis aussi un menteur,
un voleur, un...
Je veux juste refaire ma vie.
Vous comprenez ?
Mais parce que j'ai joué les durs,
personne ne veut me croire.
- On te croit, Leroy, n'est-ce pas ?
- Oh oui.
Je le crois.
Ce mec, Leroy Tidd, je crois
qu'il s'est vraiment repenti.
Je pense
qu'il veut vraiment changer.
Et comment en es-tu arrivé
à cette conclusion ?
Il était en thérapie de groupe
aujourd'hui.
Beaucoup à Oz
ont utilisé la thérapie
et l'Islam pour arriver
à leurs propres fins.
Tidd est l'un d'entre eux.
Tu as accepté des tas d'hommes
bien pires que lui.
Jefferson Keame,
le Poet, Adebisi.
Non ! Pas Adebisi !
- Oh, je vois.
- Tu vois ?
- Tu vois quoi ?
- Tidd traînait avec Adebisi.
- Tu te sens coupable de l'avoir tué.
- Non !
Je ne me sens pas coupable !
J'ai pris la bonne décision.
J'ai fait ce qu'il fallait faire.
Bon sang.
C'est ce que j'ai dit de Andrew
et Hank Schillinger.
Prendre une vie est acceptable
si c'est excusable, c'est ça ?
Beecher...
Laisse-moi tranquille.
Alors il dit, " Ne me mange pas,
mange le nègre ".
Quoi ?
Tu trouves pas ça drôle ?
Non. Mais toi...
c'est toi la blague.
- Poussez-vous !
- De la merde !
Baston ! Baston ! Baston !
Enculé !
Putain d'enculé de nègre.
Enculé !
Eh, Schillinger, je veux te parler.
Que quelqu'un lui dise que
je ne parle pas aux...
c'est quoi le terme
politiquement correct...
aux bestiaux de la jungle ?
Oh, tu vas vouloir me parler.
J'ai vu le boxon entre tes potes
et les musulmans.
Et je sais que c'est la faute de Said
si ton gars Robson a passé
quelques jours au trou.
Je te propose
de m'occuper de Said.
Contre des avantages en liquide,
bien sûr.
Quelqu'un peut lui dire qu'on peut
s'occuper de Said nous-mêmes ?
On n'a pas besoin de déléguer.
Et que quelqu'un lui dise que je vais
m'approcher de Said.
Assez prêt
pour lui trancher la gorge.
Allez, buvez.
Donc le docteur a dit
que tout allait bien ?
Oui, on a fait une échographie.
- Vous voulez voir ?
- Ouais.
- Mon Dieu.
- M. Schillinger, je m'inquiète.
Ça fait 5 mois, et on n'a pas eu
une seule nouvelle de Hank.
Je vous l'ai dit, il adore disparaître
pendant de longues périodes.
Il a l'âme voyageuse.
Comme sa mère.
Il sera présent
à la naissance du bébé.
En attendant, je ferai tout
ce que vous voudrez.
Vous êtes sûr
que Hank reviendra ?
Je le crois de tout mon cœur.
Et vous devriez y croire
vous aussi.
Ok ? Il faut que vous y croyez.
Prisonnier matricule 00C966,
Jeremiah Cloutier
Condamné le 27 décembre 2000,
détournement de fond
et vol minime.
Sentence : neuf ans,
dont cinq fermes.
C'est un de ces télé évangélistes.
Un d'entre eux ? Jusqu'à ce scandale,
il était plus important que Falwell.
Il a guéri ma sœur de la lèpre.
- Menteur.
- D'une pneumonie ?
Messieurs.
- M. Schillinger ?
- Ouais ?
Je vous donne le bonjour
de Calvin Anderson.
- Oh, vous connaissez Cal ?
- Oh oui, je le connais.
Quand vous aurez une minute,
j'aimerais vous parler.
De quoi ?
De la vie en général...
ici à Oz.
Mon emploi du temps n'est pas très
chargé. Pourquoi pas tout de suite ?
" Jacques descendit du haricot aussi
vite que possible,
et il courut et courut jusqu'à la maison
de sa mère.
Une fois arrivé,
il lui donna la harpe d'or
et tous les trésors qu'il avait ramenés
du château du géant.
Et il vécurent heureux."
- Vous croyez en Jésus Christ ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
C'est bien.
Je veux vous poser
une autre question, Vern.
J'aimerais que vous me répondiez
de façon honnête.
- Vous êtes heureux ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
De façon honnête.
Toute votre vie, vous avez cru que
votre manière de faire était la bonne...
la meilleure manière,
la seule manière.
Et pourtant,
votre femme est morte...
un fils est mort,
l'autre a disparu,
et vous êtes enfermé
dans ce trou à rats.
Comment pouvez-vous
être heureux ?
Laissez la joie de Jésus Christ
remplir votre cœur.
Laissez celui qui a souffert
emporter votre souffrance.
Ouvrez-vous au Seigneur.
Ne me touchez pas.
- Ça se passe bien la fac de droit ?
- Je me botte le cul en permanence.
- Je me souviens de ça.
- Non.
Je dois non seulement devenir
le parfait avocat,
mais aussi un mari
et un père exemplaire.
Parce que j'ai tout foiré.
C'est pas ce que je voulais dire.
C'est comme ça que Maman et Papa
le ressentent,
surtout depuis l'enlèvement,
surtout depuis que je leur ai dit
que je baisais un autre homme.
Toby, ils sont vieux jeu.
Ils n'y comprennent rien.
Tu crois que j'y comprends
quelque chose ?
Commençons à jouer.
La catégorie est littérature.
William Shakespeare
a appelé cet acte
" la bête à deux dos ". John.
Shakespeare n'est pas trop mon fort,
j'ai besoin d'un indice.
- Robert.
- Shakespeare, Shakespeare...
c'est pas le mec qui a couché
avec Gwyneth Paltrow ?
- La bête à deux dos.
- Le sexe.
Oh, le sexe.
Un rapport sexuel.
Beecher, c'est ton petit frère
que j'ai vu pendant les visites ?
- Le sexe, bonne réponse.
- Il est mignon. Il en est ?
La dernière fois, ma petite amie
s'est endormie en plein milieu.
Le maléfique Mardouk,
le Roi de Babylone,
libéra Jojakim de prison
l'année de son couronnement.
Il lui parla gentiment.
Jojakim ôta ses vêtements
de prisonnier,
et il prit ses repas avec le roi
le reste de sa vie.
C'est des conneries.
Qui a dit ça ?
Allez, grande gueule.
Trouve le courage de m'affronter.
C'est moi et c'est vrai.
Avance.
- Quel est to nom, mon ami ?
- Jim Burns.
Et pourquoi es-tu à Oz,
Jim Burns ?
Il paraît que j'ai tué mon frère,
mais je suis innocent.
Vous avez devant vous
un pécheur.
Vous avez devant vous un homme
possédé par les démons.
Les démons de la peur,
de la culpabilité et de la haine.
Je vous ordonne, démons,
de disparaître.
Je vous chasse au nom de Jésus Christ
le Sauveur.
Disparaissez, démons !
Quittez cet homme.
Replongez dans les flammes éternelles
de la damnation.
Au nom de Dieu,
je vous l'ordonne !
Au nom de Dieu,
disparaissez.
Maintenant, lève-toi.
Lève-toi, Jim Burns.
Lève-toi
et prie le Seigneur. Prie.
Prie le Seigneur.
Loué soit le Seigneur !
"Avec le pardon et la vérité,
l'inégalité est effacée.
Et avec la peur du Seigneur,
les hommes s'en vont. "
- Je peux ?
- Je vous en prie.
Je veux être heureux.
Allez, c'est quoi l'arnaque ?
Y'a pas d'arnaque.
Tu veux vraiment faire ça ?
Ça fait des mois que le gosse
de Beecher est mort.
Je me disais qu'il méditait
quelque chose, une vengeance.
Il n'a rien fait.
Oui, mais toi
et ce pédé ensemble
à une des sessions de Sœur Pete ?
- C'est dingue.
- Pourquoi ?
J'en ai marre de ces conneries.
Je veux me concentrer sur la naissance
de mon premier petit enfant.
Tu sais, je veux juste
un peu de bonheur.
Vern, tu commences
à me faire flipper.
Tobias, je pense que
Schillinger est sincère
et qu'il veut oublier cette horrible
histoire entre vous deux.
J'ai essayé de faire ça en tentant
de retrouver son fils Hank.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai eu en retour ?
Mon fils est mort,
ma fille est traumatisée.
Oui, mais cette fois,
pour la première fois,
le besoin de réconciliation
vient de Schillinger.
Et alors ?
C'est peut-être une autre ruse,
une sorte de vengeance.
On ne le saura jamais
si on n'essaie pas.
Prisonnier matricule 01B784,
Ronald Barlog.
Condamné le 12 janvier 2001,
vol de voiture.
Sentence :
13 ans, dont six fermes.
Voici ton sponsor,
Tobias Beecher.
Il t'aidera à t'acclimater
à ta nouvelle vie.
- Beecher, voici Ronald Barlog.
- Ronnie.
- Salut.
- Ok.
On y va, Ronnie.
Putain de merde ! Keller !
Regardez-moi ce fils de pute.
Comment ça va ?
- Comment tu vas ?
- Bien, bien.
- Ça fait combien de temps ?
- La dernière fois, t'étais à Tommy F.
Tu criais pour Leila. "Il faut que
je vois Leila au ponton".
- Tu criais pour qui ?
- Je vais te dire un truc.
Installe-toi et on parlera.
- Ok.
- Ok, cool. Tu gagnes ?
Non, je me fais niquer.
Il est mignon.
Il en est ?
Je présume que je suis en bas ?
Sauf si tu veux être en haut.
Non, non, j'aime bien être dessous.
- T'as connu Keller dehors ?
- Oh, ouais.
On a été... on a été partenaires
un moment.
Vous avez déjà baisé ?
Quoi ?
- T'as besoin d'un truc, tu demandes.
- Ok.
Prisonnier matricule 01R289,
Burr Redding.
Condamné le 11 janvier 2001
pour assassinat,
sept tentatives de meurtre.
Sentence : Perpétuité,
peine incompressible.
Depuis la mort d'Adebisi,
les gars sont en plein désarroi.
- Redding pourrait les galvaniser.
- Et vous voudriez que je...
Je voudrais qu'on gagne
tous les deux sa confiance,
faire de lui un partenaire
au lieu d'un ennemi.
Je ferai ce que je peux.
M. Redding,
je m'appelle Tim McManus.
Voici Kareem Said.
Salaam Aleikum.
C'est toi qui as buté
Simon Adebisi.
- Oui.
- Magnifique.
Il paraît que c'était
un sale fils de pute...
ce qui fait de toi bien pire.
Il faudra que je fasse gaffe
à mes fesses.
J'ai tué Adebisi en autodéfense.
- La court m'a disculpé.
- J'en doute pas.
Mais les motifs sont moins importants
que le résultat.
Il est mort, et pas toi.
- Je peux m'en aller ?
- Non.
Il faut que vous compreniez comment
les choses fonctionnent ici.
J'ai grandi dans le ghetto.
Papa est mort quand j'avais 10 ans.
J'ai dû quitter l'école
pour aider ma famille,
en faisant le cireur de chaussures
et d'autres trucs du genre.
Je suis allé au Vietnam
où on m'a appris
comment tuer des petits enfants
et des femmes.
J'ai visité des tas de prisons,
de l'Arizona à l'Alabama.
Je ne dis pas ça
par fierté ou par honte.
Je veux juste m'assurer
que vous pigez
parce que j'ai déjà capté
comment ça marche ici.
- Je peux m'en aller ?
- Oui.
Eh !
Augustus.
Oh, je suis content
que tu sois ici, Burr.
Hmm.
Enfin, pas que ici, ici.
J'ai compris.
- Comment va Delilah ?
- Delilah est morte.
Ses ovaires se sont retournées
contre elle.
Oh, je suis désolé.
Dis-moi comment ça marche ici.
Qui est important dans le coin ?
A quels frères il faut que je cause ?
Ok.
En premier,
il y a ce type... Poet.
Il paraît que depuis la mort d'Adebisi,
tu diriges la bande.
Ouais, c'est exact.
Il paraît aussi que tu fais
un boulot de merde.
Écoute, vieil homme,
laisse-moi t'expliquer...
Tu crois que ça me gêne
d'être vieux ?
J'ai déjà rencontré des mecs
plus costauds que toi,
qui m'ont dit bien pire et sont pas
devenus aussi vieux.
Mon âge est mon honneur
et ma force.
Tu crois que tu peux débarquer
et prendre les commandes ?
Certains sont des chefs nés,
d'autres pas.
Un homme sage connaît
ses propres limites.
Réfléchis.
On a une affaire qui roule.
- On veut pas de tes conneries.
- Du calme, Chucky.
On aimerait avoir ton amitié.
On pourrait même
te donner une part.
C'est extrêmement généreux.
Je vais y réfléchir.
Y réfléchir ?
C'est à prendre ou à laisser.
Les gars, je vous ai déjà dit
que ces salles étaient pour des cours,
pas pour votre comité d'entreprise.
Allez, on y va.
Allez, avance !
T'attends ton invitation, Redding ?
Allez !
Red, tu sais que ces enculés
préparent un coup contre toi ?
Bien, c'est ce que je veux
qu'ils fassent.
Tu veux qu'ils te tuent ?
Je veux qu'ils essaient.
La nuit dernière,
un cargo chinois
s'est échoué
sur la Jeb Island Sound.
Quand les gardes-côtes ont voulu
évacuer l'équipage
ils ont trouvé 36 étrangers illégaux
à bord.
Pendant que le Département d'État
va déterminer leur statut légal,
les 18 hommes, 12 femmes
et six enfants
seront hébergés
dans divers bâtiments publiques,
y compris la Prison d'Oswald.
Leo, c'est de la folie.
L'État a 40 autres prisons.
Qu'on mette ces hommes ailleurs.
J'ai eu un coup de fil
du Secrétaire d'État.
Il a demandé de l'aide.
Je ne suis pas du genre à me disputer.
Vous cherchez un boulot
dans la nouvelle administration ?
- Ne soyez pas stupide.
- Ma question est :
On les met où ? On est à deux doigts
de la surpopulation.
Comme c'est
une situation temporaire,
on pourrait mettre des lits de camp
dans la salle commune d'Em City.
Non, merci. Je viens tout juste
d'y rétablir l'ordre.
Vous n'allez pas y foutre
le bordel.
Il n'y a pas à discuter.
Nous avons une urgence.
Et tout le monde, vous y compris,
va devoir se plier.
- Vous voulez dire s'écraser.
- Tim...
Je sais que d'un point de vue pratique,
c'est difficile,
mais il ne faut pas perdre de vue
l'aspect humanitaire.
Ces hommes et leurs familles
ont fuit la répression en Chine,
en payant une somme énorme
pour finir sur ce bateau.
Et visiblement, les conditions étaient
pires que pour des esclaves.
Ils ont voyagé pendant des mois,
se sont échoués, ont été arrêtés,
ils sont séparés de leurs femmes
et de leurs enfants.
Si nous devons les récupérer,
autant les aider.
Voici Gou Liu Xio
du Département d'État.
- Mme Gao, enchanté.
- Merci.
Les hommes sont
dans un bus dehors.
Ok, allons les récupérer.
Bonjour,
je suis Tim McManus.
Ils resteront dans mon unité, faîtes-moi
savoir ce que je peux faire
- pour qu'ils soient à l'aise.
- Parfait. Venez avec moi.
Je ne vais pas vous mentir
en vous disant que la vie sera facile.
Les prisonniers d'Oz sont parmi
les plus violents du pays.
Mais nous avons ajouté des agents
de correction à l'unité
et ils ont reçu l'ordre
de vous protéger.
Y en a-t-il qui parlent anglais ?
Oui... moi.
Bien, je compterai sur vous
- pour aider à la communication.
- Je suis à votre service.
Merci. Suivez l'Agent Armstrong.
C'est l'Amérique, Gongjin,
parle anglais.
Ne te rends jamais volontaire.
On risque
de nous renvoyer en Chine.
Je ferai tout pour prouver
que ma place est ici.
Ces gens sont nos invités,
et j'attends de vous
que vous les traitiez de la sorte.
S'ils ont des problèmes,
les répercussions seront sérieuses.
Ils vont bientôt arriver, Ok ?
Jusqu'à ce qu'ils s'habituent
à leur nouvel environnement,
on va tous vous boucler.
Oh, allez, quoi ?
Oui, oui, ça me fend le cœur.
Bouclage. Allez. On y va !
- Vous restez en ville ce soir ?
- Oui.
Vous faites quelque chose
pour dîner ?
- Vous me rencardez ?
- Oh non, non,
mais il faut bien qu'on mange.
Je connais un petit resto,
très informel,
où on peut vite manger.
Rien de bien délirant.
Ton grand-père a raison.
Ce sont de mauvais hommes.
T'as un problème avec la cuisine,
le bridé ?
- Non, non.
- Alors bouge toi.
Tu ralentis ma fidèle clientèle.
Je me demande
comment vont Wan Wa et Jia Yu.
Mai Shoo Ying est une dure.
Elle prend soin de Wan Wa.
Mais mon fils... tous les enfants
sont à l'orphelinat.
Il n'a jamais été
séparé de nous avant.
Eh, les gars, c'est ma table.
- Vous dites quoi ?
- C'est ma table.
Lève ton cul de jaune
et barre-toi.
Oh, eh ! Non, non. Stop !
On est désolés.
Chuck... c'est pas une façon de traiter
ces pauvres gars.
- T'es leur chef ?
- Non.
- Ils t'écoutent.
- Oui.
Ça fait de toi leur chef.
Viens me voir.
On discutera, Ok ?
- Ok.
- Ok.
- N'y va pas.
- Comment ça ?
C'est un homme puissant.
Il pourrait nous aider.
Si seulement nous n'étions pas
montés à bord.
J'aimerais que
nous soyons à Tong Du.
A mourir de faim ? Tu as vu
notre récolte brûlée par le soleil.
Tu as vu ta fille mourir.
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
- S'ils nous renvoient...
- Je n'irai pas !
Je préfère mourir en Amérique.
- Jiu Shi.
- Jiu Shi, ça veut dire quoi ?
" Directeur " comme Mao.
J'adore. Jiu Shi Morales.
En fait,
ça serait Morales Jiu Shi.
Le nom de famille
est toujours premier.
C'est ce qui ne va pas
de votre côté du monde.
Les noms, la façon de lire,
l'alphabet bizarre.
- Vous faîtes tout à l'envers.
- Ou bien c'est vous.
Ouais.
Mr. Bian, je voulais vous voir
pour vous prévenir.
Vous voyez cet homme là-bas ?
- Oui.
- Burr Redding est votre ennemi.
Il vous déteste,
vous et vos amis.
Pourquoi ?
Nous ne lui avons rien fait.
Il a servi au Vietnam.
Nous sommes chinois.
Il ne fait pas la différence.
Il ne voit que votre peau jaune.
Il a juré de tous vous tuer.
J'irai le voir.
Pour le raisonner.
Il a l'air
d'un homme raisonnable ?
Il faut que vous le tuez.
Pas vous forcément,
mais un de vos hommes.
Nous sommes
des gens simples...
fermier, ouvrier.
Nous avons quitté la Chine
pour échapper aux meurtriers,
pas pour en devenir un.
Alors désormais je vous appellerai
" Hombre Muerto ".
- Ça veut dire quoi ?
- Homme mort.
Un Chinois est venu me dire
que tu les as menacés.
De quoi vous parlez ?
Je ne leur ai même pas parlé.
J'ai plus de raisons de le croire
lui que toi,
alors, laisse-moi
te dire une chose.
S'il se passe quelque chose,
je te tiendrai responsable.
- C'est des conneries.
- C'est comme ça, c'est tout.
Tu te tiens tranquille,
compris ?
C'est magnifique.
Tu as des nouvelles de Jia Yu ?
Dis-lui que... que je l'aime.
Et, Wan Wa...
Je t'aime aussi.
Ok.
- Elle était comment ?
- Je... lui manque.
Elle dit que Shoo Ying
s'occupe de tout.
Merci pour le coup de fil, Jiu Shi.
Je vous en prie.
Travail.
Que... c'est quoi ?
Oh, on a tous un boulot à faire.
Oh, je... j'aimerais travailler.
- Oui ?
- Sûr ?
Oui. Je veux faire ma part.
- Ok, laissez-moi parler à des gens.
- Ok.
Comment ça va, Ousi ?
- Yixue.
- Yixue, pardon.
C'est pas comme si j'allais devoir
prononcer ton nom plus longtemps.
Que se passe t-il ?
Tu vois, Yixue, tu as fait exactement
tout ce que je voulais
et j'en suis reconnaissant,
mais je dois te demander
une dernière chose.
Quoi ? Quoi ?
Meurt !
Ma femme, mon fils.
Ils te pleureront pour toujours.
A l'aide !
Je t'avais prévenu.
- Quoi ?
- Mettez-le dans la cage.
- Putain, mais pourquoi ?
- Allez, on y va.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- Allez, bouge !
Oh, fils de pute.
Allez.
Allez. Allez.
Rentre là-dedans !
Ouvrez cette putain de porte !
Ouvrez-la !
Non ! Non !
Tout converti, qu'il aille
du communisme au capitalisme
de six paquets par jour
à non-fumeur
finit par condamner
ses anciennes pratiques.
Ça ne marchait pas pour lui, ça ne peut
donc marcher pour personne.
Sa vision devient étroite,
aveuglée par la lumière.
Qu'il devienne hindou ou rejoigne
les Alcooliques Anonymes,
il devient un fanatique.
Pour moi, ce sont les fanatiques
qui bousillent le monde.
Les fanatiques pensent
que Dieu est à leur côté.
Nous autres ?
Pas besoin de lumière divine.
Dans le noir de la nuit, nous voulons
juste assez de lumière
pour ne pas cogner notre pied
en route vers les toilettes.
La plupart des prisons
fabriquent quelque chose...
plaques d'immatriculation,
vêtements, puces informatiques.
A Oz, y'a une chose qu'on fait
mieux que qui que ce soit :
la vengeance.
Ouais, on fabrique
la vengeance en série
avec plus de précision qu'une chaîne
de montage de chez Ford.
Nous sommes connus
dans le monde entier.
Et je suis heureux d'ajouter,
à notre avantage,
que la vengeance est
un secteur en expansion.
Qu'est-ce que
vous regardez, putain ?
Bon, le directeur
veut te voir.
Nous pensons que
tu as fait tuer Bian Yixue.
Qu'est-ce qui vous
fait croire ça ?
Bien est venu me dire
que tu l'avais menacé.
McManus, vous pensez
que je suis stupide ?
Vous m'avez dit que si on touchait
aux clandestins je serais responsable.
Et le lendemain
j'aurais buté ce type ?
Foutaise !
Et si tu pensais que j'te croyais
trop malin pour ça ?
Et peut-être que
quelqu'un m'a piégé.
Nous n'avons
aucunes preuves.
Juste la parole
d'un homme mort.
Merci d'avoir organisé
mon séjour dans la cage.
Je l'oublierai pas.
Super le putain de plan A.
C'est pour ça que ça s'appelle
le Plan A, Chucky,
Parce que y'a toujours
le Plan B, C, D,
jusqu'à Z si besoin est.
On a pas le temps de passer
tout le putain d'alphabet en revue.
Cet enculé va s'occuper
de nous et vite.
Eh, Glynn. Ma douche
marche pas.
Je chlingue ici, bordel !
Directeur, j'ai des nouvelles
pour vous.
Faut que vous m'écoutiez,
j'ai des tuyaux sérieux.
Directeur !
Faut me laisser sortir.
Faut que j'vous parle.
Vous m'entendez ?
Tu voulais me voir ?
J'ai une proposition.
- Vous l'avez fouillé ?
- Oui, monsieur.
Fermez la porte,
mais restez à proximité.
D'accord.
Quoi ?
Je sais qu'il y a eu
de grosses merdes entre nous.
Et que vous voulez me garder en
isolement pour les reste de mes jours.
Mais ça, je peux pas
parce que j'vais devenir
un putain de zombie,
surtout après avoir goûté
à la liberté.
Viens-en au fait.
Remettez-moi à Em City,
et en échange
je serai vos yeux
et vos oreilles.
- Un informateur ?
- Ouais.
Tout ce que vous voulez
savoir, je le trouverai.
- Et ta loyauté à El Norte ?
- Qu'ils aillent se faire foutre.
C'est ce putain d'Hernandez
qui me voulait mort,
et qui m'a mis dans
ce putain de taudis.
Tu es dans ce taudis parce que
tu es pire qu'un animal.
Tu comprends ?
Alors c'est non ?
C'est oui.
Tu es aussi
le mouchard parfait.
Tu t'es fait épingler
en entrant au Mexique ?
T'es bête ou quoi ?
Beau comme un sou neuf,
Alvarez.
Ramène-moi de la chatte.
Miguel Alvarez. J'me demandais
quand tu viendrais me voir.
Il s'en est passé
depuis mon évasion.
Hernandez est mort.
Et ça te fait quoi ?
Ça me fait plaisir.
Je détestais
ce putain d'enculé.
L'honnêteté.
J'aime ça.
Mais il paraît que parfois
t'es trop honnête.
Écoute, j'en ai rien à péter.
Tu diriges maintenant.
Rien que toi.
J'veux revenir, c'est tout.
Dis-moi ce que j'dois faire.
Tu vois cet homme là-bas ?
Burr Redding ?
- Ouais.
- Tue-le.
"La vengeance est mienne",
dit le Seigneur.
C'est vrai.
D'après la Bible,
la vengeance est la propriété
exclusive du Dieu Tout-Puissant.
Mais si Dieu admet
utiliser la vengeance,
et s'il ne peut faire
que du bien,
ça veut dire que
la vengeance, c'est bien ?
Ça veut dire que si
on est faits à l'image de Dieu,
la vengeance devient non pas un acte
de haine mais une croisade sainte ?
Une chose sacrée ?
Bien. Point suivant, Gloria.
La société Wygert
nous a demandé de participer
à l'expérimentation d'une nouvelle
drogue qu'ils développent.
Je m'oppose à utiliser
les prisonniers comme cobayes.
Ils participeraient volontairement.
Pourquoi ils feraient ça ?
Pour rendre service
à l'humanité ? Allons.
Wygert a aussi
contacté le gouverneur,
qui a accepté de réduire les peines
des prisonniers qui participeront.
C'est quoi cette drogue ?
Une cure pour le cancer ?
Non, elle est conçue pour réduire
la surpopulation des prisons.
Au lieu de faire
son temps de prison,
le criminel prendrait une pilule
et vieillirait d'autant.
- Tu veux dire, devenir vieux ?
- Oui.
- Pour de vrai ?
- Ça se fera sans doute dans 10 ans,
mais ces tests vont donner
les résultats préliminaires
sur lesquels d'autres recherches
se baseront,
jusqu'à ce que ce soit
approuvé par la loi.
Si je comprends bien si un type
de 20 ans doit faire 30 ans,
la drogue lui donne
un corps de 50 ans ?
Oui.
Et on le libère.
Il y a... il y a
des risques, bien sûr.
Plusieurs animaux ont eu problèmes
cardiaques, tumeurs, deux sont morts.
Nous ne sommes pas sûr comment
la drogue agira sur des humains,
si vous vieillirez vite, ou si vous
gagnerez plus d'années que prévu.
Le risque est grand.
C'est un grand sacrifice.
C'est pourquoi la récompense
est grande aussi.
Beecher, tu vas t'inscrire ?
Je sais pas.
Ma fille a besoin de moi, mais...
comment ce sera pour elle si j'ai l'air
plus vieux que mon grand-père ?
- Et toi ?
- Non, j'peux pas.
J'suis ici à perpète.
Tout ce qu'ils pourraient
me donner, c'est du cyanure.
J'épouse Norma.
Ce serait bien
d'avoir une vie normale,
mais j'ai peur de mourir.
Si tu restes ici, t'es pas sûr
de survivre. J'vais le faire.
Moi aussi. Je préfère encore
une tumeur à ça.
Ce programme est immoral.
C'est pas naturel.
Ouais, mais quand même, mon père
a eu une attaque cérébrale.
J'aimerais être avec lui
avant qu'il meure.
- Oh !
- Eh, beau mec !
Ces vêtements de cuisinier
sont tellement sexy.
- J'adore un homme en uniforme.
- Non...
- Pas ici. Pas maintenant.
- Pourquoi. T'as la migraine ?
Je t'ai dit. On peut plus faire ça.
C'est dingue, putain.
Et je t'ai dit que c'est moi
qui décide quand on arrête.
Je peux aller
en parler au directeur.
Bien sûr ça m'arrêterait
de te baiser.
Bien entendu, faudrait que je trouve
quelqu'un d'autre,
quelqu'un d'aussi
beau que toi.
Bon Dieu.
Oh, je sais. Pourquoi pas
ton frère, Cyril ?
D'accord.
Aujourd'hui tu vas jouer
au petit Hollandais
qui a mis le doigt
dans la gouine.
Écoute, Brenda.
Les chocolats sont arrivés hier.
Ils étaient très bons.
Allez, putain de gogole.
J'ai bien aimé ceux
aux noisettes.
Lâche-le, Cyril !
Arrête ! Arrête !
J'vais te tuer, putain !
Calme-toi !
Le comportement de Cyril
continue à être imprévisible.
On devrait sérieusement envisager
de le transférer à l'institut Conley.
Le séparer de son frère
va aggraver les choses.
Ouais, mais ce sera plus
notre problème.
Et cette partie remise ?
Le dîner ?
Vous faites quoi ce soir ?
J'suis de garde. Le Docteur Prestopnik
a un engagement.
- Demain soir ?
- Peut-être. On verra.
Le temps c'est tellement merdique,
surtout ici à Oz.
Quand on pense
au temps gaspillé
et au temps
qu'il vous reste à faire
et le temps qu'il
vous reste à vivre.
Écoutez...
J'ai entendu parler
de la nouvelle drogue.
Faut que vous nous aidiez
à sortir d'ici, mon frère et moi.
J'vous en prie, Gloria,
rendez-moi vieux.
- O'Reily n'est pas un bon candidat.
- Pourquoi pas ?
Les détenus qui participent doivent
avoir fait leur temps ferme.
Il est ici à perpétuité
et son frère aussi.
Je peux faire une demande
d'exception au divisionnaire.
S'il écoute quelqu'un,
ce sera moi.
- Pourquoi vouloir les aider ?
- Pour des raisons humanitaires.
Humanitaire et Ryan O'Reily,
ça va pas ensemble.
- Tu peux lui parler ?
- Gloria...
Pourquoi vous voulez pas
lui donner une chance ?
- Je lui en ai donné des tas.
- Vous êtes tellement aveugle parfois.
Si O'Reily fait partie
de ce programme
je ferai tout pour
qu'on l'annule, bordel !
Je le jure !
Cinq d'entre vous
vont prendre la drogue.
Cinq d'entre vous prendront
un placebo inoffensif.
Une fois par semaine
vous aurez une nouvelle dose
et un examen médical complet
afin de suivre
votre état de santé
et les progrès
de votre vieillissement.
Vous avez des questions ?
Allons-y.
Prends-le, Cyril.
- J'aime pas ça.
- Allez. Prends-le.
Une fois mon oncle
Bilbo a dit
"La vengeance est un plat
qui se mange froid".
Ça doit vouloir dire que
si la personne qui veut se venger
le fait quand il est encore
dans tous ses états,
il va sans doute
rester sur sa faim.
Mais celui qui s'approche
du but l'œil froid et clair,
il aura un festin.
Bon appétit.
Augustus Hill.
Ça va, mon frère ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, Vahue ?
La réponse est non.
Pourquoi t'es comme ça ?
On remonte à loin nous deux.
- Ouais, à l'antiquité.
- L'antiquité ?
Je me souviens quand je suis arrivé
à Oz, j'étais ton héros.
Tu devrais parler
du match contre les Bulls en 95.
- T'as marqué 58 points.
- Ouais, t'as toujours été mon héros.
C'est moi.
Un putain d'exemple.
J'étais encore naïf
à l'époque.
Je croyais que t'étais aussi bon
dans la vie qu'au basket.
Attends un peu.
Pendant les émeutes,
j'me suis mouillé,
j'ai essayé de sauver la vie
d'Eugene Dobbin.
J'en ai tiré quoi ?
Une raclée et un transfert.
- Peu importe.
- Va te faire enculer.
Merde, depuis mon retour à Oz,
j'me suis fait invisible.
J'ai embêté personne.
J'suis éligible pour
la liberté conditionnelle.
Pendant que tu pourriras ici,
je serai à nouveau dehors.
De retour sur le terrain.
Avale ça, minus.
- Merde !
- Quel est le problème ?
Je cherche le nom
de celle que Jackson Vahue
a tabassée et presque violée.
- Celle qui l'a envoyé ici.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que cet enculé de Vahue
va embobiner le comité d'évaluation
pour obtenir
la liberté conditionnelle.
Je veux m'assurer qu'elle ait
l'occasion de les en dissuader.
Tu le détestes
toujours autant ?
C'est pas
une histoire de haine.
C'est une question
de justice.
Il en a pris pour 12 ans.
- Il devrait les faire en entier.
- S'il sort maintenant,
il a une chance
de retrouver sa carrière.
- Dans sept ans, il sera trop vieux.
- Exactement.
Ça m'a tout l'air d'être
de la haine.
Oui, Beverly Reed
s'il vous plait ?
Oh, bonjour, Beverly.
Peu importe qui je suis.
Ce que j'ai à dire est important.
On vous a prévenue que Jackson
Vahue pourrait être libéré ?
C'est bien ce que je pensais.
Ouais, j'ai pensé que vous auriez
votre mot à dire.
Eh, Jackson.
Ça s'est bien passé
ton évaluation ?
Oh, merde.
Eh, Smith. Ma douche
est toujours déglinguée.
- Eh, eh.
- Putain de bordel ?!
Eh, mignon.
Eh, allez.
Eh, mon nègre.
Eh, regarde. Tu peux pas
faire mieux que ça.
J'veux juste cinq minutes
avec le directeur.
J'ai un truc important à lui dire.
Allez, Smith !
- Arrange-moi ça.
- C'est le jour du déménagement.
Je veux juste m'assurer que vous
comprenez ce qui se passe.
L'année dernière,
pendant la détente au gymnase,
vous avez poignardé un homme
du nom de Louis Bevilaqua.
Vous l'avez tué.
Vous vous en souvenez ?
- Mal, mal...
- Chauve.
- Ouais.
Le tribunal vous a jugé
coupable d'assassinat.
Le juge...
il vous a condamné à mort.
- Mort, mourir, mort.
- Oui.
Peter... Peter Marie ?
Et ils vont vous transférer
au couloir de la mort
où vous allez rester...
jusqu'au... jour de votre...
- Non !
- ...exécution.
Sauver ! Sauver ! Sauver...
Désolée...
Eh, Lopresti, c'est qui ça ?
Ton nouveau copain,
William Giles.
Peter, Peter Marie.
Elle est pas là
pour te protéger, mon pote.
C'est moi
ton sauveur maintenant.
Eh, je m'appelle Moïse.
Ça va ?
- Tutti frutti.
- Tutti frutti ?
- Ça veut dire quoi, bordel ?
- Dit dit dit dit.
Dit dit dit.
Dit dit dit.
- Da da da da da.
- Super.
Mes derniers jours sur terre et j'suis
enfermé avec un putain de cinglé.
- Petit toutou.
- C'est ça.
Vous avez plus que ça dans le ventre.
Allez, on pousse !
Ouais.
Ouais.
C'est ça.
Ouais, allez.
Continuez.
Tu n'as rien à faire ici.
- Imam Said, je...
- Tu ne peux pas devenir musulman.
S'il vous plait, aidez-moi.
Lâchez-moi !
Allez.
Prisonnier numéro 00T255,
Leroy Tidd.
Condamné le 10 mai 2000, pour vol à
main armée, mise en danger d'autrui
par imprudence.
Sentence : 20 ans, dont 12 fermes.
- Ouah !
- Ballon !
- Donne-moi le ballon.
- Dis à ton ami Said que j'aime pas
- aller au trou à cause de lui.
- Donne-moi le ballon.
Oh, bien sûr.
Gare ta gueule !
Qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé
au visage ?
J'vais te raconter.
Je veux te raconter.
Quelle que soit ta colère
contre Leroy Tidd...
elle va disparaître.
Ok. Je t'écoute.
Merci de m'avoir fait
sortir du trou
et de m'avoir fait revenir
à Emerald City.
J'avais tort.
Je t'ai blâmé
pour les péchés d'autres.
Pour ça,
je suis vraiment désolé.
Salaam Alaikum, mon frère.
Je déteste qu'on ait l'air con
alors que les nègres gagnent.
T'inquiète pas.
Quand Said sera mort,
- on va mettre la volée à Tidd.
- Ouais.
Cet enculé
ne sait pas frapper.
J'vous ai dit
de laisser Said tranquille.
Vous voulez déclarer
une putain de guerre ?
Tidd va faire
tout le sale boulot.
Personne ne saura
qu'on est impliqués.
On est à Oz.
Les gens savent comment
découvrir la vérité.
Vas donc taper
sur ta Bible, Ok ?
Barre-toi. Scram.
On est des potes
de Vern Schillinger.
Vous lui déglinguez la tête.
C'était moi qui devais parler.
Laisse-moi parler, putain.
Alors accouche.
D'abord, vous le convainquez de suivre
ce programme avec Beecher.
Messieurs, je vous assure,
je ne l'ai convaincu de rien
si ce n'est de regarder dans son cœur,
d'ouvrir son cœur au Seigneur.
- Son cœur se portait bien sans vous.
- Va lire un livre.
Schillinger dirige le quartier.
Je comprends que
vous voulez qu'il vous guide.
Non, on veut qu'il montre
des couilles, pas du cœur.
Des couilles.
Quand quelque chose doit être fait,
faut que ce soit fait
sans...
Comment vous appelez ça ?
Dilemme moral.
- Y'a plein de façons de faire.
- Pas ici, Rev.
Lâchez les baskets à Vern,
ou Hoyt vous arrangera
un tête à tête avec Jésus bientôt...
au paradis.
Allez.
J'ai eu la visite
de deux de vos amis,
- Robson, Hoyt.
- Ils vous ont menacé ?
- Oui.
- J'vais leur parler.
Non. J'ai pas peur.
J'voulais juste
vous mettre au courant.
Ils feraient tout
pour vous récupérer.
Écoutez, Révérend, j'ai...
j'ai lu les saintes écritures,
j'ai parlé avec vous, mais je sais
toujours pas où j'en suis.
J'veux pas être
un grand saint,
j'veux... juste avoir
de la joie dans ma vie.
Au diable ces deux enculés
s'ils peuvent pas comprendre.
Ouais, qu'ils aillent au diable.
Voilà les coordonnées d'une femme
que je veux que tu appelles
si tu as besoin
avant la naissance,
ou si tu veux juste
parler à quelqu'un.
La Nouvelle Eglise du Christ.
J'ai entendu parler.
C'est pas ce groupe
dont le pasteur a volé des centaines
et des milliers de dollars ?
Oui, le révérend Cloutier.
Il est ici.
C'est un homme bon, Carrie.
Je lui ai parlé de toi,
et je lui ai dit que t'as personne,
- sauf moi et Hank.
- Hank ?
Il est où Hank, bordel ?
Pas une carte postale.
Souviens-toi,
il a quitté la ville
avant de savoir
que tu étais enceinte.
S'il l'avait su, il serait ici.
Ouais, soyez-en pas si sûr.
Le Révérend dit
que cette femme, cette Sarah,
elle était toute seule
et enceinte
avant de trouver
sa congrégation.
Si tu te sens seule, appelle-la, Ok ?
Elle comprendra.
Je vous croyais pas
du genre religieux.
Je... je le suis pas.
Je... je veux dire,
j'ai toujours été chrétien.
Seulement... je commence à voir
d'autres côtés de la chose.
Ok, Schillinger est en route
pour l'interaction.
Vous avez le trac ?
On a parlé de tous
mes sentiments à son égard.
J'sais exactement
ce que j'veux lui dire
et je sais pratiquement
ce qu'il va me dire,
mais j'ai les mains moites
et j'ai envie de vomir.
Bien, mais ça veut pas dire
que c'est une erreur de le rencontrer.
Je veux que ma fille
soit en sécurité.
Que ma famille
soit en sécurité.
Je voudrais m'éveiller
sans avoir peur.
Entrez, Vern.
Asseyons-nous donc.
Bien, qui veut commencer ?
Moi.
On pourrait peut-être commencer par
une lecture des saintes écritures.
Bien sûr.
- Tobias, ça vous ennuie ?
- Non, pas du tout.
"Le loup habitera
avec l'agneau,
la panthère se couchera
avec le chevreau
le veau, le lionceau et la bête grasse
iront ensemble,
conduits par un petit garçon.
La vache et l'ours paîtront.
Ensemble se coucheront
leurs petits.
Le lion comme le bœuf
mangera de la paille.
Le nourrisson jouera
sur le repaire de l'aspic
sur le trou de la vipère
le jeune enfant mettra la main.
On ne fera plus de mal ni de violence
sur toute ma montagne sainte.
Prisonnier numéro 96K423,
Timothy Kirk,
Condamné le 16 avril 1996.
Homicide involontaire, mise en danger
de la vie d'un enfant.
Sentence : 12 ans,
dont sept fermes.
Corps en bonne santé,
esprit en bonne santé.
Dans l'église catholique, le corps
est le temple de l'Esprit Saint,
que nous sommes supposés
garder pur. Vous y croyez ?
Notre corps
est un cadeau de Dieu.
Nous avons le devoir
d'en prendre soin.
Et le sexe ?
C'est aussi un cadeau de Dieu ?
Bien sûr.
Vous voulez que
je vous taille une pipe ?
Qu'est-ce qui te fait
croire que j'en veuille une ?
Tout le monde
veut se faire tailler une pipe.
Non, merci.
Recule s'il te plait.
Tu as été adorable
pour toute une vie,
sexy comme
un petit garçon perdu,
mais tu as jeté ton bébé
à la poubelle.
C'est un crime d'homme.
C'est le moment d'être un homme.
Bob, t'as passé un bon moment
avec ton fils ?
Oui, bien que la santé
de mon petit fils se détériore.
Oh, j'en suis désolé.
Norma.
- Bob, voici ma fiancée, Norma Clark.
- Enchanté.
Agamemnon m'a tellement
parlé de vous.
Pas en bien, j'espère.
J'vous laisse tranquilles
les amoureux.
Tu as parlé à qui il faut
pour qu'on se marie ?
J'ai rendez-vous
avec le directeur demain.
- Tu crois que ce sera un problème ?
- Oh, non.
Oh bien.
On était déjà fiancés
Maggie et moi,
quand elle est tombée enceinte.
De nos jours,
c'est pas une affaire,
mais en 65,
vu le rang social
de sa famille,
"enfant naturel"
signifiait scandale.
On aurait quand même pu
affronter ça tous les deux.
Maggie était...
Oh, Maggie.
Ça suffit pour ce soir.
Deux semaines
avant le mariage,
j'ai poignardé Norton Pratt
dans le cou.
Et Maggie est morte
en accouchant.
Ma belle Maggie.
- Je vous souhaite que du bonheur.
- Merci, Bob.
Je veux vraiment
danser à ton mariage !
Busmalis.
Busmalis.
J'connais ton p'tit secret.
J'ai un p'tit secret ?
Un p'tit secret
avec de la terre.
Tu sais, comme creuser.
Tu creuses ?
La nuit avant
qu'ils me remettent ici,
ben ça alors,
je t'ai vu creuser
un putain de tunnel.
- Un tunnel ? Non.
- Te fous pas de moi.
Tu me prends
pour qui, bordel ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
De toi... rien.
Mais je pourrais utiliser
ce que je sais
pour me sortir
d'isolement.
Non, je t'en prie.
- Je vais me marier...
- Quoi ? Te marier ?
Qu'est-ce que
j'en ai à foutre ?
- je te paierai.
- Me payer ? Me payer quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux
que je fasse de ton argent
avec le cul enfermé ici, hein ?
Eh, on ne parle pas !
J'autoriserais quelqu'un
à se marier dans la prison
- en récompense pour bonne conduite.
- Je me conduis très bien.
Tu as creusé un tunnel
et tu t'es évadé
avec Alvarez, me créant
bien des soucis.
- Mais vous nous avez rattrapés.
- Busmalis est désolé, n'est-ce pas ?
- Oui.
- Un peu de romance ce serait sympa.
Ok.
Si tu me jures que tu ne
creuseras pas d'autre tunnel,
tu peux avoir ta cérémonie.
Mais si tu me mens,
c'est l'isolement cellulaire
et tu ne verras plus jamais Norma.
Sur la tombe de mon père,
la vie de ma mère
et mon honneur de scout,
je jure que je ne creuserai plus.
Vas-y, fais les démarches.
J'ai jamais rempli un tunnel.
C'est presque un crime.
Un tunnel tellement beau.
- Tu ferais bien de te manier.
- Ouais.
Je crois que tu peux...
Oh, oh.
- Merde !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
J'ai touché quelque chose.
Mon doux Jésus.
Commence à creuser,
Busmalis.
L'année dernière les Hatfields
et les McCoys,
deux familles en guerre
depuis 150 ans environ,
se sont rencontrées
pour faire la paix.
Imaginez ça, laisser tomber
tant de haine après toutes ces années.
Certains pensent que tout a commencé
à cause d'un cochon volé
bien que d'autres jurent que c'était
à cause d'une femme.
Floria, c'est ma chanson préférée.
Conneries, tu sais même pas
qui la chante.
- Eh Floria, vous êtes d'où ?
- Les HLM de Jane Street.
Moi aussi.
Enfin tout près. J'ai grandi à MLK
dans le quartier sud.
J'adore vos yeux.
Je les putain d'adore.
- Bonjour, Floria.
- Bonjour.
- C'est la queue pour voir Leo ?
- Et il n'est pas encore là.
Hill, Poet, qu'est-ce que
vous faites ici ?
Tout le monde a signé
cette pétition pour avoir le câble.
La télé publique est nulle.
C'est à moi que vous auriez
dû amener ça.
Reconduisez-les.
- Au revoir, Floria.
- Au revoir.
- A plus tard, Floria.
- Au revoir beaux yeux.
- Jolis, mignons yeux.
- Vous allez sortir ?
Eh, McManus, quand le directeur
arrive, vous pouvez me passer devant.
- C'est tellement généreux, Lopresti.
- Vous êtes un homme occupé.
Bonjour.
McManus, Lopresti.
Donnez-moi
deux minutes, Ok ?
- Bien sûr.
- Prenez votre temps.
Oh, M. le directeur,
avant d'entrer...
Qu'est-ce que...
Surprise.
J'ai fait redécorer par les ouvriers
pendant le week-end.
Eh, Floria, vous pouvez peut-être faire
mon bureau après ça.
- Ça va ?
- Si ça va ?
C'est... fantastique.
Vous êtes fantastique.
La cafétéria est prête
pour le congrès régional.
Les autres directeurs de prisons
seront ici à 10h00,
- et le gouverneur à 11h30.
- Bien.
Et je vous ai peut-être trouvé
un appartement,
à environ six pâtés de maisons.
Studio meublé avec femme de ménage.
- Ma femme a appelé ?
- Non... monsieur.
Envoyez-lui des fleurs.
J'ai un message.
C'est de la part de son avocat.
Il veut savoir qui il doit
contacter pour le divorce.
Je sais pas.
J'en sais putain de rien.
J'ai jamais divorcé.
Je pourrais
vous trouver quelqu'un.
Mon frère est avocat.
Il saura qui serait bien.
Envoyez des fleurs
quand même.
CONGRES REGIONAL
DES DIRECTEURS DE PRISONS
Bonjour Leo.
Le congrès se passe super bien.
Vous avez fait fort.
J'aurais dû me douter
que vous viendriez.
Je dirige Loyler maintenant.
Quand j'ai appris que le divisionnaire
pensait à vous pour remplacer Cards
je lui ai dit ce que
je pensais de vous.
Et vous pouvez voir combien
vous avez de l'influence.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Attendez. Vous ne voulez pas de
nouvelles de Clayton Hughes ?
Ça va pas super. Les prisonniers
le détestent parce qu'il était gardien.
Et les gardiens aussi parce qu'ils le
prennent pour un traître.
Il se bagarre souvent.
Pour l'instant il est
sous protection.
- Je crois pas qu'il survivra un an.
- Bon Dieu.
Le clou de la soirée est arrivé.
Je veux transférer Clayton à Oz.
- Je peux le protéger.
- C'est ça.
Je peux le protéger.
Leo, Martin.
Vous semblez bien
vous déplacer avec ces trucs.
D'après mon kiné,
je me remets plus vite
qu'aucun de ses patients.
J'espère laisser tomber
les béquilles bientôt.
Belle petite réception, Leo.
Beaucoup ne voulaient pas
que je vienne
étant donné que c'est
la même pièce...
où on m'a tiré dessus.
Mais, oh et puis merde.
Sans l'intervention
de votre type Clayton,
Alva Case aurait
peut-être gagné l'élection.
Rappelez-moi d'envoyer
des remerciements à Hughes.
- Mon Dieu.
- Bonjour Leo. Content d'être de retour.
- Je vais être où.
- Quartier J.
Le quartier des flics ? Non.
Depuis quand tu penses
avoir le choix ? Allez.
C'était qui tes amis,
trou du cul ?
C'est qui, petit enculé ?
Fils de pute.
Espèce de petite queue.
J'vais te mettre
la volée de ta vie.
Enculé, tête de merde, salaud !
Fils de pute !
Tu me craches dessus !
Espèce de tête de nœud !
Putain de salaud !
Prisonnier numéro 01Y208,
Alvin Hewitt.
Condamné le 20 janvier 2001,
pour coups et blessures
sur un mineur.
Sentence : 12 ans,
dont sept fermes.
Eh, c'est pour quand le déjeuner ?
Je crève de faim.
Il arrivera comme tous
les putains de jours.
Vous savez, on avait
une shérif adjointe
- chez moi qui vous ressemblait.
- Ah oui ?
Elle était dure,
fallait pas déconner.
Elle avait une opinion sur tout.
Et je suppose que toi
et tes hommes
dans ton patelin
vous pouviez rien faire ?
Oh, non, pas besoin.
Elle s'est saoulée
un soir après le boulot,
dans un bar à Spencer
et s'est fait violer sur la table de
billard par un groupe de motards.
Pourquoi on a pas
de table de billard ?
- Agent Howell ?
- Oui, monsieur.
- Vous connaissez Clayton Hughes.
- Bien sûr. Cellule numéro deux.
Assurez-vous
qu'il ne lui arrive rien.
Je suis gardien, M. le directeur,
pas faiseuse de miracles.
Ça va, John ?
On ne peut mieux.
Déjeuner.
J'ai fait ça spécialement
pour vous, Inspecteur.
J'ai ajouté un peu
d'assaisonnement.
- T'as craché dessus ?
- J'ai pissé dessus.
Le nouveau c'est le garde qui a essayé
d'assassiner le gouverneur ?
- Ouais.
- Il aurait dû passer
plus de temps
à s'entraîner à tirer.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as dit, enculé ?
- Eh !
Nom de Dieu !
Nom de Dieu, attends !
Je t'en prie !
Vous savez que Goergen
n'était pas aimé, John,
mais ça n'excuse pas le fait de l'avoir
poussé dans une cage d'ascenseur.
Mais je pense que la plupart
des gens du poste croient
que vous y étiez obligé.
Pas Nancy.
Elle n'est pas venue à mon procès
et pas une fois ici.
Je ne vais pas vous mentir.
Nancy est en colère.
Vous étiez son coéquipier.
Elle se sent trahie.
Le pire ici
c'est qu'on peut pas parler
à ceux à qui on veut s'expliquer.
Je vais vous dire l'autre raison
de ma visite.
Votre épouse m'a appelé.
Elle est très triste que vous refusiez
de la voir ou Robby.
Je ne peux pas.
Abby ne comprend pas ?
Je ne peux pas lui faire face ?
ou a lui... mon fils.
- Elle veut venir sans Robby.
- Non.
- John.
- Non.
Écoutez, elle vous aime
et votre silence la tue,
tout comme le silence de Nancy
vous fait du mal.
C'était un honneur
d'être sous vos ordres.
Bordel de merde, Keller.
- Eh, je suis content de te voir.
- Comment tu vas ?
- Ça va ?
- Ronnie est mignon.
Il aime se bécoter ?
A l'appel !
97B412, Beecher.
00M871, Morales.
96G522, Morales.
95H522, Hill.
- Ronnie.
- Quoi de neuf ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais,
tu te branles ?
J'fais juste faire quelques exercices
matinaux à Magic Johnson.
Ouais, comme Magic n'a pas eu
d'action hier soir.
Ce qui veut dire ?
Y'a des règles
contre la baise.
Depuis quand tu respectes
les putains de règles ?
Depuis que t'es coincé
avec Beecher.
- Plante pas ta bite dans ce connard.
- Non ?
Non, ce type est une pute.
Rien que des ennuis.
Ouah.
Si seulement
tu me l'avais dit hier...
parce que hier soir,
il m'a taillé une pipe de luxe.
Je sais ce que tu fais.
Tu baises Barlog
pour me rendre jaloux ?
Pauvre petite pute.
T'as tué les deux derniers types
avec qui j'ai couché.
Tu vas aussi tuer
ton vieil ami Ronnie ?
Aide-moi à comprendre
quelque chose.
T'étais... le roi de l'arnaque.
Un flic t'aurait
donné son badge.
Comment tu t'es fait coincer pour
le cambriolage d'une épicerie,
pour une putain
de conduite imprudente ?
Ouais, ben après
mon dernier divorce
- j'suis parti en chute libre.
- Je me souviens.
Beaucoup de drogue,
plein d'étudiants.
En y réfléchissant,
une partie de moi
pense que j'ai cambriolé ce magasin...
la plus stupide des conneries...
parce que je voulais
me faire pincer.
Tu sais, une tranche folle
de mon cerveau disait
"Eh, retire-toi de la rue
pour quelque temps".
88 ans, c'est...
c'est beaucoup de temps.
Quoi, Keller ?
Ohé !
Prenez une chambre.
Extinction des feux.
Enfin.
- Ronnie.
- Non, non, non.
- Quoi ? Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Keller.
Quoi, Keller ?
- On a baisé cet après-midi.
- Quoi ?
Ouais. Pour la première fois.
Et c'était super.
Je... je le connaissais, tu sais.
On a fait des trucs ensemble
toutes ces années.
Keller était comme
un grand frère pour moi.
Parfois il pensait à une arnaque,
et moi, je suivais.
Mais, euh...
je ne m'étais jamais avoué...
Il dit qu'il m'aime.
Il m'a fait promettre
qu'on baiserait pas...
Il ne t'aime pas, Ronnie.
C'est juste encore
une magouille.
Probablement.
Mais, Beecher...
on est à Oz...
alors quelle putain
de différence ça fait ?
Alors vous étiez l'ami de Keller
avant son arrestation ?
Ouais. bien sûr,
je le connaissais.
Le 2 mai 1998, il était
dans un bar homo
et a embarqué Bryce Tibbetts.
Il a passé la frontière de l'État
et est allé dans une forêt
où il l'a sodomisé,
torturé et assassiné.
Quel rapport avec moi ?
- Il vous a déjà parlé de ce meurtre ?
- Non.
- Et de Mark Carachi ?
- Non.
- Biam Lewis ?
- Non, rien de tout ça.
Dommage.
S'il vous en avait parlé,
et que vous témoigniez, vous pourriez
avoir une réduction de peine
de 13 ans à disons, cinq.
- Cinq ?
- L'offre reste ouverte.
- Faut que j'appelle mon avocat..
- Bonne idée, Ronnie.
Appelez-le.
Quelle est la seule position
qui ne soit pas mentionnée
dans le numéro de Abbott et Costello
"Qui Est en Premier" ?
- Je déteste le baseball.
- Je déteste Abbott et Costello.
C'est pas en champ intérieur.
- J'ai besoin d'aide.
- Didi.
Si j'étais vous,
je choisirais
la mauvaise position.
- Arrêt court.
- Choisissez pas la mauvaise position.
- Champ droit.
- Champ droit.
Vous êtes dans le droit chemin
avec 1000 $.
Merde, faut qu'on ait le câble.
Nous sommes ravis quand cette
ancienne étudiante en esthétique
- vient nous voir. La belle Didi Conn.
- Tu veux quoi ?
T'es... t'es avocat,
n'est-ce pas ?
- Je l'étais.
- Ouais.
J'aimerais te parler de quelque chose,
si tu veux bien.
Une offre que...
les flics me font.
Je fais pas de bénévolat.
Je...
Tu regretteras pas
la consultation.
On pourrait peut-être s'arranger.
Keller.
Oh, on se parle ? Je croyais
qu'on essayait de s'emmerder.
Ronnie Barlog se prépare
à te balancer.
Foutu menteur.
Le FBI lui a offert
une réduction de peine
s'il témoigne contre toi pour
ces meurtres d'homosexuels.
Tu dis ça parce que
t'es jaloux.
Crois ce que tu veux.
Ecris-moi depuis
le couloir de la mort.
C'était qui
qui voulait te parler ?
Le FBI.
Il me passent sur le grill pour
cette banque à Buffalo.
Voilà, c'est fait.
T'es incroyable, Ronnie.
Tu peux tout réparer.
Certains sont doués
en mécanique, c'est tout.
Tu as beaucoup de talents.
Une super imagination,
tu sais bien parler.
Moi ? Non, arrête.
Paraît que tu racontes beaucoup
d'histoires fantastiques.
Des histoires sur moi
et ma rencontre
avec certains jeunes hommes.
Chris, j'ai rien dit, je le jure.
- T'es sûr ?
- Ouais, sur ma vie. Allons.
Tu jures sur ta vie,
ça me suffit.
Suce ma bite.
Tu sais que
je jacasserais jamais sur toi.
Ils m'ont fait une offre,
mais je les ai envoyés chier.
Je leur ai dit
"Allez vous faire foutre".
Tu sais, parfois je pense
que j'ai tué tous ces types
parce que je voulais tuer
la partie de moi qui me dégoûte.
Quand vous vous
vengez de quelqu'un,
vous leur faites le plus beau
compliment en fait.
C'est comme dire,
"tu as tellement affecté ma vie
que je dois te rendre la pareille.
Je dois affecter ta vie aussi
profondément que toi la mienne".
La vengeance pourrait être
la carte de vœux ultime.
Ouais. quand on y pense
comme ça,
l'expression est vraie :
"La Vengeance est douce".
A Oz, faut être prêt
à se défendre
à tout moment.
La personne qui vient vers vous
peut avoir une arme
alors il faut en avoir une aussi.
Il faut être prêt à tuer
ses ennemis,
ou au moins à les ralentir.
Tu m'as dit que si je
te sortais d'isolement,
tu moucharderais et
deviendrais mon indicateur.
Tu m'as rien dit
que je ne sache déjà.
Morales veut pas me laisser
revenir à El Norte si j'tue pas Redding.
Alors t'es baisé, Alvarez,
et inutile pour moi.
Je ferais aussi bien
de te renvoyer en cellule d'isolement.
Attendez. Il veut que je bute
quelqu'un, n'est-ce pas ?
C'est un complot, ça.
Je fais juger Morales
pour conspiration, et alors ?
Il reste à Oz,
à vendre de la drogue.
Donnez-moi deux jours,
j'vais essayer de trouver
un autre moyen
de m'attirer ses faveurs.
Juste deux putain de jours.
Miguel, Miguel, t'étais où ?
En train de lécher
le cul du directeur.
C'est drôle.
Pas autant que tu penses.
Il veut que j'te balance.
Il dit que si je lui donne pas
d'infos secrètes sur la drogue...
Je vais encore jouer
en solitaire.
Alors j'ai réfléchi.
Je pourrais peut-être
être une sorte
d'agent double, non ?
Je lui donne juste les infos
que tu veux qu'il ait.
- C'est une idée brillante.
- Tu crois ?
Sauf qu'il n'y a pas d'infos
que je veux que Glynn ait.
Désinformation ?
Si tu lui dis des trucs
qui s'avèrent faux,
combien de temps
il va te faire confiance ?
Non, mon ami,
si j'étais à ta place...
et je suis content de pas l'être,
je me préparerais
à l'inévitable :
Passer les 50 ans prochains
seul avec toi-même.
Quoi de neuf ?
Que veux-tu, Alvarez ?
Parler à ton patron.
On a rien à voir avec toi.
- Morales te veut mort.
- C'est pas nouveau.
Il m'a ordonné de te tuer.
Je vois.
J'veux pas avoir à verser
plus de sang que j'ai déjà versé.
Je vois toujours pas
ce que tu veux.
Je veux t'aider
à éliminer Morales.
Tu joues avec le feu,
mon garçon,
à trahir ta propre race.
Ils m'ont trahi en premier.
Y'a pas de doute,
mais le problème c'est que si
tu t'associes à un traître,
tu sais jamais
quand il pourrait te trahir.
J'apprécie ton offre, mais je crois
qu'on va devoir la décliner.
Déclinée.
Pourquoi tu parles avec Redding ?
Je voulais emprunter
de la lessive.
Ouais ?
On a pas oublié
que t'as planté Carlo Ricardo.
Et alors ?
Quand Chico Guerra
va sortir de l'hôpital,
lui et moi on va
te faire la peau.
Pourquoi attendre
qu'il sorte, trouillard ?
Vas-y, baby.
J'ai rien sur moi.
Rien à perdre, rien à gagner.
Allez, p'tite pute.
Cette lame,
que nous appelons
la baïonnette Gillette
n'a pas été conçue pour percer,
mais pour trancher.
La lame d'un rasoir jetable
est extraite de son support
en plastique,
puis attachée à un stylo
ou un crayon,
seulement le danger
avec ce truc, c'est que...
vous finissez par vous
couper vous-même.
Busmalis est en
isolement cellulaire, Norma.
Pourquoi ?
Pour pouvoir
vous épouser,
Il a promis au directeur
qu'il ne creuserait plus de tunnels.
Seulement il en avait déjà
commencé un.
Quand il a essayé de le combler,
tout a foiré.
Il va être en isolement
combien de temps ?
Difficile à dire.
Je vais voir ce que je peux faire
de mon côté.
Merci, M. Rebadow.
Il me manque tellement.
Oui.
Il me manque aussi.
La vérité c'est que
il a commencé à creuser ce tunnel
avant de promettre de ne pas le faire.
Très belle histoire, Rebadow.
Et pourquoi je devrais te croire ?
Parce que vous me connaissez,
M. le directeur.
Ça fait 35 ans que je suis à Oz.
J'ai vu des meurtres,
des émeutes,
j'ai eu une centaine
de camarades de cellule différents.
Pas une seule fois
je me suis mouillé pour un autre.
J'ai survécu
en ne m'impliquant pas.
Busmalis mérite mieux que ça.
Ok.
Mais plus de bon sang
de tunnels !
Je sais pas comment
tu m'as fait sortir,
ni comment
je te revaudrai ça.
N'importe quoi.
Je t'en devais une.
Busmalis...
plus de tunnels.
Évidemment.
En isolement j'ai eu le temps de
réfléchir à mon obsession de creuser.
Les tunnels ne sont rien d'autre
que des tombes par extension.
Mais je ne suis pas mort.
Loin de là.
Avec Norma, tu as
toutes les raisons de vivre.
J'vais aller appeler Norma.
La société Wygert
a mis au point une pilule
qui provoque un vieillissement du
corps plus rapide que la normale.
Alors si on donne cette drogue
à un prisonnier,
il vieillit du nombre d'années
qu'il était supposé faire,
et ensuite on le relâche.
Mais ce putain de procédé
annule la raison d'être
de notre travail.
Tim a raison. Vous prenez un tueur
de 20 ans qui en a pris pour 20,
vous lui donnez une pilule,
bingo, il a 40 ans mais c'est
toujours un assassin sans pitié.
Cette drogue ne prévoit pas
la réhabilitation.
Cette drogue est l'admission ultime
de notre échec.
Nous ne pouvons
récupérer ces hommes
et nous ne devrions
même pas essayer.
Faut mettre fin à ce projet
tout de suite.
C'est bien toi, Tim,
changer un différend
entre nous en une sorte
de fausse croisade.
Tout ça parce qu'il ne voulait pas
que les frères O'Reily participent.
Mais il a soulevé
des points valables.
- Peter Marie...
- Désolée, mais c'est vrai.
Des point valables ?
Qui d'entre vous peut prétendre
avoir réellement changé
l'un de ces enculés ?
On ne fait que les faire passer
par le système.
On les amène, on les enferme,
on les relâche.
Au moins avec cette pilule
on se fait pas poignarder.
Si t'as tellement peur, Lopresti,
retourne vendre
des voitures d'occasion.
- Vous voyez ?
- Fais pas le trou du cul.
- C'est pas juste moi.
- C'est toi qui a commencé.
Ça suffit.
J'vais appeler le divisionnaire
et lui exprimer notre souci.
Mais jusqu'à ce qu'il décide
de tout arrêter,
le programme continue.
J'ai une question.
Cette nouvelle drogue
qu'on expérimente,
Faut combien de temps
pour en ressentir les effets ?
Comme je l'ai déjà dit, ça n'a jamais
été testé sur des humains,
mais les rats de labo ont commencé
à vieillir en trois jours environ.
Si je deviens vieux et fripé,
vous m'aimerez encore ?
Au suivant.
Cyril, rien à signaler ?
J'ai mal au ventre.
Venez, asseyez-vous.
Ok, respirez bien fort.
A l'appel !
Cyril, allez, viens.
Allez, Cyril, lève-toi.
Sainte Marie, mère de Dieu !
Ryan,
j'me sens pas très bien.
Je reviens tout de suite.
- Eh, alors ?
- Il a commencé à vieillir.
Et moi ?
Votre corps doit métaboliser
plus lentement,
ou bien vous prenez
le placebo.
Ouah, attendez.
L'idée c'était que Cyril et moi
on fasse ça ensemble.
Vous vous souvenez ?
Pour sortir d'Oz ensemble.
Vous me dites qu'il...
qu'il va vieillir
et peut-être pas moi ?
- Oui.
- Arrêtez de lui donner cette drogue.
Non. Vous avez tous les deux
accepté de la prendre.
Et bien je désaccepte.
Tout ce que j'ai fait
a ruiné la vie de Cyril.
J'vais pas le regarder
se désintégrer sans rien faire.
- Vous avez signé un accord.
- Je m'en moque.
Et bien pas moi.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Cyril, mets ta chemise.
On s'en va.
Nous le gardons ici en observation
quelques heures de plus.
Sortez-le de là.
- T'as vu les cheveux de mon frère ?
- Plutôt bizarre.
Cet histoire de vieillissement
est foireuse. Faut laisser tomber.
Faut en parler à Robson et Kirk et les
autres pour qu'ils en fassent autant.
Quoi ?
Ça c'est bien toi.
J'ai donné ma parole,
et aussi terrifié que je sois
par les effets de la drogue,
je la respecterai.
Bien. J'vais parler
aux autres moi-même.
Je sais pas si ça servira
à grand chose.
Des couillons comme
Robson, Hoyt et Wick,
ils ont l'habitude de jouer
à la roulette russe avec leurs vies.
A mon avis,
ils vont te rire au nez.
- Vous allez bien aujourd'hui ?
- J'ai le trac.
C'est beaucoup d'argent.
Et bien, pour vous aider,
voici la présentatrice
de la très populaire
"Cour d'école de Miss Sally",
Whitney Allen.
Bienvenue, Whitney.
Le docteur Nathan dit
que j'ai des morpions,
des petites bestioles qui vivent
autour de mes couilles.
Merde.
Ouah. c'est zarbi.
Ses cheveux
qui deviennent blancs.
Au moins, ça va pas
nous arriver.
En dehors des morpions,
j'me sens super bien.
J'suis peut-être parmi
les cinq qui ont eu le placebo.
Wick, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Wick ?
Bordel de Dieu !
Murphy !
Murphy !
Aboulez-vous ici !
Gloria.
- Vous venez jubiler, Tim ?
- Non, m'excuser.
Vous aviez tout à fait raison
quand vous avez dit
que je transformais
notre désaccord en autre chose.
Je suis sûr que vous agissiez
avec la meilleure intention.
Vous croyez ?
Ma réponse à tout ce qui
entre par cette porte
est une pilule
dans la bouche.
Je n'essaie même plus
de guérir les gens.
Je suis un dealer de drogue.
Mieux vaut ça qu'un...
putain, je sais même plus
ce que je suis,
sauf un type fatigué
qui a faim.
Bonsoir.
Tim.
Ouais ?
Cette partie remise
pour dîner ?
J'aimerais bien
y aller maintenant.
Vous êtes sûre ?
Ouais.
Je veux pas
être seule ce soir.
Tu te souviens
quand on était petits ?
Maman nous chantait
une chanson.
Essaie de dormir.
Je me souviens plus
de la chanson.
Pousse-toi.
 ? A Killarney ?
 ? Il y a longtemps ?
 ? Ma mère me chantait ?
 ? Une chanson ?
 ? Sur un ton doux et bas ?
 ? Juste une petite chansonnette ?
 ? A sa vieille et douce
façon irlandaise ?
 ? Et je donnerais le monde ?
 ? Pour qu'elle puisse chanter ?
 ? Cette chanson ?
 ? Pour moi aujourd'hui ?
 ? Too-ra-loo ?
 ? Ra-loo-ral ?
 ? Too-ra-loo-ra-li ?
 ? Too-ra-loo ?
 ? Ra-loo-ral ?
 ? Chut, ne pleure pas ?
 ? Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral. ?
Et je suis sûr que nous
éprouvons tous une grande joie
en regardant notre frère
embrasser l'Islam,
et désormais
il ne sera plus connu
sous le nom de Leroy Tidd,
mais Salah Yudin.
Cela signifie honorer la foi.
- Allah al-Akhbar !
- Allah al-Akhbar !
Bienvenue, mon frère.
Imam, il y a des choses dont je veux
te parler, mais j'ai peur.
N'aie pas peur, mon frère.
A partir de maintenant, tu peux
me demander n'importe quoi.
Même sur Adebisi ?
C'était un mauvais homme,
mais c'était mon ami.
- Tu l'as fait assassiner.
- Non.
Sa mort n'a jamais
été mon but.
J'ai essayé de le sauver.
Ce fils ne voulait pas
être sauvé.
Il pensait savoir ce dont
il avait besoin dans la vie.
Après avoir satisfait
toutes ses envies,
et réalisé que ses désirs
étaient vides, qu'il n'avait rien,
le seul désir qui lui restait
était de mourir.
Comment sais-tu ça ?
Tu as juste besoin de regarder
dans les yeux d'un homme
pour voir si son heure
est arrivée.
Salut, Leroy.
Je croyais qu'on avait un marché.
Que t'allais tuer Said pour nous.
- J'vais le faire.
- Quand ?
Il est entouré de son équipe
en permanence.
J'attends un moment
où il sera seul.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Said fait la sieste.
Tu sais qu'il a de la tension ?
Non, je savais pas.
Tu veux prendre une pause ?
Je serai ravi
de te remplacer.
J'ai besoin d'aller pisser.
Alors soulage-toi.
Ok.
Il devrait dormir encore 20 minutes.
Je reviens tout de suite.
Quelque chose
qui ne va pas ?
Tout va bien.
Tu es en sécurité.
- Bon Dieu !
- Ça va pas ?
Je commence à avoir marre
de ton Redding,
d'attendre qu'il fasse quelque chose
pour Pancamo et Morales.
J'sais pas pourquoi il monte pas
zigouiller ces enculés tout de suite.
Relax.
Il sait à quoi s'en tenir.
Il nous dira quand c'est
le bon moment.
Non, c'est bien
qui je pense ?
- Jackson Vahue ?
- Ouais, c'est lui.
Putain, c'est pas vrai.
J'avais entendu dire qu'il était ici,
mais je l'avais pas vu.
Il aime pas
se faire remarquer.
Je veux le rencontrer.
Ouais, ouais, viens.
Jackson.
Salut, Jackson.
Quoi de neuf ?
Tout va bien.
comment tu vas ?
Mon pote, Omar White, Vay.
Il voulait te rencontrer.
Salut.
J'étais là le soir
où t'as marqué... quoi ?
48 points contre les Bulls.
Poet, t'as quoi en réserve ?
J'croyais que tu touchais plus
à la drogue.
Ça c'était quand j'essayais
d'être mis en liberté conditionnelle.
Maintenant j'suis coincé
dans ce taudis encore sept ans.
File-moi de la came.
Tout ce que tu veux.
On va t'en passer.
- Ouais.
- Bien.
Ça va te faire du bien.
Te redonner la pêche.
j'suis ton homme.
Ouah, Jackson Vahue.
J'sui là a essayer d'être sympa
avec cet enculé,
et il me regarde comme
si j'étais pas là,
comme si j'étais transparent.
Il a d'autres merdes en tête.
C'est ça mon problème.
Je fais pas bonne impression.
Je rigole pas.
Depuis tout petit,
je rencontre des gens et je...
je leur fais
aucune impression.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Je vais te montrer.
Je vais leur faire voir qui je suis
à ces enculés.
Gesticule pas
avec cette merde.
Ces enculés vont avoir
peur de moi. Tu vas voir.
Regarde.
Eh, dégage.
McManus.
- McManus.
- Ouais ?
Elève-lui la tête.
Tu saignes comme un porc,
McManus. Ça fait quoi, baby ?
Oh, putain !
On appelle cette lame "l'émoussée".
C'est assez courant.
Un prisonnier martèle
un morceau de métal à l'atelier
puis il frotte le métal
contre un mur en pierre.
Y'en a plein à Oz.
Il lui donne
la forme d'une lame.
Ce qu'il y a de beau c'est
que ce bébé fait le plus possible
de dégâts à l'intérieur.
Basil, t'as de la visite.
Qui ?
Nancy Mears.
C'est ta maîtresse ?
En quelque sorte.
C'était ma coéquipière.
Quand j'étais en mission
à Em City,
elle prétendait être
ma copine.
T'as l'air surpris de sa visite.
Je le suis.
Elle a refusé de me voir
jusqu'à présent.
Nancy.
Je suis vraiment
content que tu sois venue.
Ordres du capitaine.
Quoi ?
Shumond.
Il m'a dit de venir.
Oh.
Désolé qu'il t'ait forcée.
T'as quelque chose à me dire ?
Je voulais m'excuser
de t'avoir menti
quand j'étais en mission.
Je me suis tellement
identifié à Desmond Mobay
que j'ai laissé les choses
se dégrader.
Ok.
Salut.
C'est tout ?
Ok, salut.
Tu attends quoi de moi ?
Le pardon ?
Écoute, être flic
c'est merdique.
Les gens que nous devons
protéger et servir
pensent que nous sommes
brutaux, indifférents,
intouchables et corrompus.
Chaque jour je me bats
contre cette image
et chaque jour une ordure
comme toi gâche tout.
Alors non,
je ne te pardonnerai pas.
Mais j'te promets
que je t'oublierai.
J'vais oublier ton existence.
Et si Shumond le demande,
dis lui bien que je suis venue.
Eh, toi !
Je veux jouer aux cartes !
Pas avec toi.
Quand vas-tu
accepter que toi,
moi et Johnny on est liés.
On étais tous flics.
Des flics qui,
pour une raison ou une autre,
ont déraillé.
J'ai rien en commun
avec toi.
J'suis un prisonnier politique
incarcéré par un système injuste.
Non, mon fils,
t'es qu'une ordure qui vise mal.
Et t'es un homme mort.
C'est une menace ?
Pas une déclaration d'amour.
C'est bien ce que je dis, ordure.
Arrête de me fixer.
Relax.
Cet enculé n'arrête pas de me fixer
comme s'il me jetait un sort.
Le directeur veut te voir. Viens.
J'me demande pourquoi.
Morales et Pancamo
ont tué Bian Yixue.
Vous avez des preuves ?
Alors malheureusement
j'peux rien faire.
Nous voulions vous voir,
Gongjin,
pour que vous puissiez
préparer les autres.
A rentrer chez nous ?
No, il s'agit de Jia Kenmin.
Vous l'avez attrapé ?
Oui, il a déjà été
jugé localement pour drogue.
Hier le jury
l'a déclaré coupable.
Il va repasser au tribunal fédéral
pour vous avoir fait venir
illégalement dans ce pays,
vous et les autres.
Mais en attendant, il va venir ici.
Dans cette prison ?
Oui. Et nous allons le garder
complètement isolé
jusqu'à ce que
vos gens soient partis.
Jia Kenmin est à blâmer
pour cette souffrance.
Il a organisé le bateau
qui nous a amenés de Chine.
Oui, et il sera puni
en conséquence.
Je voudrais le rencontrer,
voir son visage.
Gongjin...
Je vous en prie, je ne lui
ferai pas de mal.
Quel mal pourrais-je faire ?
C'est un tueur.
Pas moi.
Prisonnier numéro 01J813,
Jia Kenmin.
Condamné le 2 février 2001,
pour possession et distribution
d'une substance illégale.
Sentence :
15 ans, dont cinq fermes.
Wong Gongjin,
Jia Kenmin.
- Bonjour.
- Pas de contact physique.
Assis.
L'agent va rester dans la pièce
pendant ces cinq minutes
et il peut arrêter la conversation
à n'importe quel moment.
Ok ?
Alors ?
On m'a dit
que tes parents
ont quitté la Chine comme nous,
ils ont échappé à l'horreur
pour te donner une vie meilleure.
Alors comment peux-tu traiter
ton peuple comme de la crotte ?
Je veux te tuer...
mais te tuer ne rendra pas
Yixue à sa famille.
Les hommes dans cette prison
ne sont pas honorables.
L'es-tu ?
L'es-tu, Jia Kenmin ?
Si oui, il y a une chose
que tu pourrais faire
pour te racheter.
Une chose que je demande
pas seulement pour moi,
mais pour l'honneur
de tous ceux qui souffrent.
...Enrique Morales.
Tu feras ça ?
Tu le jures ?
Le Département d'État, sous la pression
du gouvernement de Beijing,
a décidé de ne pas accorder
l'asile politique
aux 35 autres clandestins chinois,
dont le bateau s'est échoué
près du détroit de Jeb Island.
Les réfugiés seront déportés
en Chine demain
où un avenir incertain les attend.
Dans un instant, les informations
économiques avec Marcia Levy.
Regarde qui est sorti d'isolement.
J'avais oublié
que Ketchum était à Oz.
Ouais, il est arrivé
il y a deux mois.
Il se fait appeler
Supreme Allah.
Il a été jugé pour le meurtre
de deux autres détenus.
Burr, J'ai entendu dire
que t'étais remis en circulation.
T'approche pas de moi.
Ouais.
Qu'est-ce qui te prend ?
Tu t'es jamais demandé
pourquoi les flics savaient
où t'étais le soir de ton arrestation ?
J'ai pensé qu'ils me surveillaient.
Surveillance mon cul.
Ketchum leur a dit.
Quoi ?
Ils l'avaient coincé
sur un vieux mandat d'amené.
Ils le pressaient
comme un citron.
Il t'a donné.
Si c'était pas pour
Supreme Allah,
tu serais pas
dans ce fauteuil.
Tu serais pas à Oz.
On n'aime pas Burr Redding
plus que toi.
Tu le veux mort,
on le veut mort.
Occupe-toi de ça, et tu peux
rejoindre notre organisation.
D'accord.
Mais il me faut
un peu de temps
pour mettre d'autres frères
de mon côté.
N'attends pas trop longtemps.
Redding prépare
quelque chose.
Faut qu'on lui torde le cou
avant qu'il ne torde le nôtre.
Merde, mon pote.
Ça doit être chiant
d'être infirme.
Non,
c'est une partie de plaisir.
Je sais que t'as connu Burr Redding
dans le même coin que moi.
Je l'ai fréquenté toute ma vie.
Il s'est occupé de moi et ma famille
quand mon père a été tué au Vietnam.
Ouais, je sais que
tu l'aimes beaucoup.
C'est pourquoi faut
que tu lui dises...
Les métèques et les ritals
le veulent mort.
Si t'as tellement peur pour lui,
t'as qu'à aller lui dire.
Ce sale nègre veut pas
que je l'approche.
Ça t'étonne ?
Merde, ouais.
Je l'ai jamais roulé.
- Et moi ?
- Explique-toi, minable.
Tu m'as mis ici.
A Oz, dans le fauteuil.
Conneries.
Burr a appris que tu m'avais
dénoncé aux flics.
Conneries.
Conneries.
- J'vais t'en faire voir des conneries.
- Ça va pas ?
Ah ! Merde.
T'es putain de cinglé ?
Faut des couilles pour tabasser
un type en fauteuil roulant.
J'ai pas touché Hill.
Tout comme t'as pas tué
ces deux autres détenus,
Shemin et Browne.
Je suis innocent.
Y'en a d'autres qui doivent
payer pour ce crime.
Je suppose que tu es
aussi innocent
d'avoir flingué Gray Daniels ?
Non.
Cet enculé
s'est moqué de moi.
Il a eu ce qu'il méritait.
J'te le dis, Supreme sait
qu'on a buté Shemin et Browne
- et qu'on lui a collé ça dessus.
- Impossible.
Je lui ai pas dit, ni toi.
Il a peut-être tout compris.
Tous les deux ont baisé avec Beecher.
Alors peut-être qu'il pense
que c'est toi, mais pas moi.
Tu vas me laisser tomber ?
Non. Écoute, je peux peut être
aller voir Allah,
voir ce qu'il sait vraiment.
Tu peux me faire confiance.
J'ai pas le choix.
Putain !
Quel idiot je suis.
Eh, Supreme, mon pote.
Ce truc tombe en panne
chaque fois que j'essaie de le mettre
en marche. Tu peux jeter un œil ?
- Non.
- Non ?
T'as tes règles ou quoi ?
J'ai passé beaucoup d'heures
en isolement.
J'ai eu le temps
de faire le rapport.
Shemin et Browne
plus Keller et O'Reily
égal moi presque
condamné à mort.
T'as tout faux.
Les additions n'ont jamais
été mon fort.
J'ai toujours préféré
les soustractions.
Voyons, Oz moins
Keller et O'Reily...
égale la justice.
Pourquoi tu veux tellement
voir Supreme Allah
quitter ce monde ?
Pour les mêmes raisons
que toi, je suppose.
Il s'attaque à trop fort.
Et tu viens me voir ?
Je suis prêt à t'aider
autant que tu veux.
Ouais, ben j'ai pas
besoin d'aide,
parce que je lui veux
pas de mal.
Je lui souhaite
que du bien.
C'est ça.
Jeudi à 11h00 précises.
Tu m'entends, Tug ?
Sois à l'heure.
C'est réglé.
J'te dis qui faut qu'on fasse
quelque chose et vite.
Je viens d'avoir
la drôle d'impression
que le vieux
va s'occuper de tout.
Putain !
Putain !
Cette lame est une classique.
La partie inférieure
d'une brosse à dent
est taillée pour être
très pointue,
presque comme une pointe
de flèche. Mais le mieux c'est que
l'arme n'a pas besoin
d'être cachée.
Elle peut être mise
dans la poche,
la brosse en l'air,
prête à l'action.
Écoutez, je connais à peine
Tug Daniels.
Il m'appelle,
dit qu'il veut me voir.
Comment je pouvais savoir
ce qui se passait
dans sa tête ?
Savais-tu que Supreme Allah
était en prison
pour avoir tué
le frère de Daniels ?
Ouais, je suppose.
- Où as t-il eu la lame ?
- Il a dû l'amener.
Faut pas me blâmer
pour le manque de sécurité.
Un peu de temps en cage va peut-être
t'aider à y voir plus clair.
La cage ?
J'ai rien fait, bordel.
J'ai fait que dalle.
Timmy.
Père Mukada,
vous étiez où ?
En retraite.
Le Père Makaki m'a dit
qu'en mon absence
tu as arrêté d'être
enfant de chœur.
L'église catholique
est la pute de Satan.
Quoi ?
Le Pape suce
les mamelons de l'Antéchrist.
Rome est le Gomorrhe
du nouveau monde.
- Où as-tu entendu un truc pareil ?
- Le révérend Cloutier.
Quand il a commencé à prêcher, je
pensais que c'était une vraie merde,
mais beaucoup
de ce qu'il dit a du sens.
- Tel que ?
- Que je devrais me convertir.
Cloutier dit que
si je me convertis,
il y a une fac de théologie
en Virginie de l'Ouest
où je peux prendre
des cours par correspondance
et obtenir
mes diplômes gratuitement.
Timmy, si c'est
ce que tu veux,
il y a beaucoup
d'autres écoles
que tu pourrais choisir.
- Je pourrais t'aider...
- Non, pas la peine.
Que Dieu soit avec vous.
Bonjour, Révérend.
Asseyez-vous,
je vous prie.
Merci, M. l'agent.
Je n'étais pas ici
quand vous êtes arrivé,
alors j'ai pensé
que nous devrions nous rencontrer.
Excellent.
Bien que, je dois dire
que j'ai été choqué de voir
comment la population protestante
d'Oz était servie.
J'essaie de faire
de mon mieux pour tous.
J'en suis sûr.
Et je suis content que vous
soyez ici pour aider,
ce qui me rappelle que j'ai parlé
avec Timothy Kirk.
Il dit qu'il veut préparer
une licence.
Avec le bon enseignement,
il pourrait y arriver.
Vous voyez,
c'est exactement
ce dont je voulais vous parler,
le bon enseignement.
Je ne pense pas qu'une fac
de théologie soit le mieux pour lui.
Vous préfèreriez qu'il étudie
chez les Jésuites ?
Pas nécessairement,
mais il est jeune, perdu, confus.
Je n'aimerais pas qu'on fasse
trop pression sur lui.
Il a été baptisé catholique,
il a été à l'école catholique
pendant huit ans.
Il y avait des moines
dans son lycée.
C'est pas trop de pression, ça ?
Je ne vous ai pas demandé de venir
pour un débat théologique.
Si, c'est exactement ça.
Vous avez peur de perdre Kirk
au profit du Christ.
Il a déjà le Christ.
Ça c'est pas le Christ.
C'est du show-business
sur un bâton.
Du Show-business ?
Vous avez fait de la foi
une comédie.
Attention, mon Père,
la colère, l'envie,
ce sont deux
des sept péchés capitaux.
Cet après-midi je vais
baptiser Timmy Kirk
en tant que vrai Chrétien.
Vous êtes le bienvenu
à y assister.
 ? Jésus aime
ses petits enfants ?
 ? tous les petits enfants
du monde ?
 ? rouges et jaunes,
blancs et noirs ?
 ? ils sont précieux
à ses yeux ?
 ? Jésus aime
les petits enfants ?
 ? du monde. ?
Mes premiers jours ici,
j'étais terrifié,
je partageais une cellule
avec Adebisi.
Et tu es venu me voir
très sympa.
Je t'ai sauvé
de ce salaud noir.
Vern, vous connaissez
le règlement.
Laissez Tobias
aller au bout de sa pensée.
Oui.
Continue.
L'homme que j'étais,
celui que je suis devenu,
c'est mon problème.
Mais faut que tu acceptes
ta part de responsabilité
pour tout
ce qui est arrivé.
Qu'est-ce qui vous prend
de nous interrompre ?
Pardon, le directeur
m'envoie chercher Schillinger.
Il dit que c'est urgent.
La police du Massachusetts
m'a appelé aujourd'hui.
Il y a quelques jours, il ont trouvé
le corps d'un jeune homme
mort depuis plusieurs mois
d'une balle à l'arrière
de la tête.
Ils ont vérifié
les fichiers dentaires
et ont découvert
son identité.
C'est votre fils, Hank.
Non.
Non, Hank est en Floride.
Les flics ont fait erreur.
C'est possible,
mais j'en doute.
C'est une erreur. Les flics
ont fait une putain d'erreur.
Hank n'est pas mort.
Il ne peut pas être mort.
Il a une mignonne petite femme
et ils vont avoir un bébé.
Hank n'est pas mort !
Vous m'entendez ? Pas mort !
Ton gamin était mêlé
à toutes sortes de merdes...
affaires de drogues
et prostitution...
alors y'a plein de gens
qui le souhaiteraient mort.
C'est comme ça
que tu me consoles ?
Je te dis la dure vérité.
Ton fils a été assassiné
et quelqu'un doit payer,
et je pense que
ce quelqu'un c'est Beecher.
- Beecher ?
- On attendait des représailles
pour le meurtre de son fils
par Hank, mais rien ?
C'est parce qu'il s'en était
déjà occupé.
On est à Oz. Y'a un tas de types
qui peuvent arranger ce coup.
Ce putain...
J'vais tuer sa fille.
J'vais tuer
toute sa putain de famille.
Tu le vois ?
Non.
Vern, je viens d'apprendre
pour votre fils.
- Je suis désolé.
- Merci, Révérend.
- On devrait prier ensemble.
- C'est comment la citation ?
"Il y a un temps pour être né,
un temps pour mourir,
un temps pour tout au paradis" ?
- Oui.
- Et bien le temps pour prier est fini.
Non, Vern,
Jésus peut vous réconforter.
Pas aujourd'hui.
Laissez-le tranquille,
Ok, Rev ?
T'as vu Beecher ? Où il est ?
Tout va s'effondrer.
Il avait rendez-vous
avec sa fille.
Bordel.
Faut que j'aille le voir.
Putain, comment je vais faire ?
Eh, toi.
- Moi ?
- Ouais.
T'es le frère de Beecher ?
Un civil blessé.
- Sortez-le de là !
- C'est mon frère. C'est mon frère.
Je vous en prie,
appelez de l'aide !
Et puis il y a le Don Juan.
Vous prenez le ressort
du sommier de votre lit,
vous le déroulez
et vous en aiguisez le bord.
La blessure est plus petite,
mais bien plus profonde.
Comme Don Juan...
ça pénètre.
Papa.
Faut que tu emmènes
Holly ailleurs.
- Elle est encore en danger ?
- Du même type qui a tué Gary.
- On va le dire à la police.
- La police ?
La police ne peut pas
nous aider.
Emmène-la. Loin.
Tu comprends ?
Oui, je comprends,
mais je suis pas sûr
qu'elle comprendra.
Parle-lui, Toby.
Explique-lui ce qui se passe.
Merci.
Holly...
Ça m'a fait tellement plaisir
de te voir aujourd'hui.
Je sais que je t'ai dit
que tu reviendrais bientôt,
mais Grand-père...
va t'emmener en voyage
pendant un temps,
et quand tu reviendras,
toi et moi on sera ensemble
pour toujours.
Ok ?
Je t'aime.
Souviens-toi de ça.
Toujours.
Faut que tu tues Schillinger.
- Non.
- T'as pas d'autre choix.
- Je le laisse me tuer.
- T'es fou ?
Si j'offre de mourir, ce sera
peut-être la fin de tout ça.
Peut-être qu'il laissera
ma famille en paix.
Et qu'est-ce que tu vas tirer de lui,
une garantie écrite ?
- Quel choix j'ai ?
- On colle le meurtre sur un autre.
Qui ? Et puis après ?
Schillinger tue cette personne ?
Non, j'ai assez de morts
sur la conscience.
- Il le faut.
- Non, Beech, bon Dieu.
Allez. Écoute-moi.
Calmons-nous, d'accord ?
Respirons, d'accord ?
Pense à ce que tu fais.
- Réfléchis bien.
- C'est déjà fait.
Ma famille ne peut pas
se cacher éternellement.
Si je ne m'en occupe pas maintenant,
Schillinger va les détruire.
C'est de ça que je parle,
s'en occuper.
Tu comprends pas ?
On a juste à tuer Schillinger.
Et ensuite les Aryens
vont me tuer quand même.
Et pour autant que je sache, le futur
petit fils de Schillinger va grandir,
trouver mon petit fils
et le tuer. Non.
- Chris, c'est le seul moyen.
- Attends, attends, attends, attends.
- Chris, laisse-moi.
- Attends, attends.
Ok.
Demain on continuera
l'évaluation spirituelle de Zedekia.
Révérend.
Oui... Keller, c'est ça ?
Vous savez ce que Vern Schillinger
prévoit contre Tobia Beecher ?
J'en ai bien peur,
et je ne peux rien faire
pour l'arrêter.
Il pense que Beecher
a commandé le meurtre de Hank.
Schillinger a tort.
C'était moi.
- Vous ?
- Je vais avouer aux autorités,
mais il faut que vous
disiez la vérité à Schillinger.
Alors vous voyez que c'est Keller
qui est coupable.
Tobias Beecher
est totalement innocent.
Lui faire du mal
ou à sa famille
serait une erreur tragique.
Merci d'être venu
me voir, Révérend.
Tu crois ces conneries ?
C'est Beecher qui a tué Hank.
Beecher a tué ton fils.
Quel est le meilleur
souvenir que tu as de ton fils ?
La première fois
où il est venu...
sans qu'on lui demande
pour me faire un câlin
et me dire
"Papa, je t'aime".
Beecher, je promets
de ne pas faire de mal à ta fille...
ni à personne d'autre
dans ta famille.
Je veux croire que tu es innocent
du meurtre de Hank.
Je veux le croire
parce que...
J'ai besoin de croire
en quelque chose.
Quelque chose d'autre
que la haine.
Ce petit enfant qui va arriver...
est ma dernière chance...
mon dernier espoir.
Je veux que cet enfant...
me prenne par le cou
et dise "Je t'aime".
Parce que...
Tu vois, ça m'est
jamais arrivé.
Je suis désolé pour ton fils.
Je suis désolé
pour le tien aussi.
- Bonjour, Chris.
- Sœur Pete.
Vous êtes venue
me souhaiter bon voyage ?
Asseyez-vous.
Je... je ne sais pas exactement
ce qui s'est passé,
mais je pense que comme d'habitude
vous savez toute la vérité.
C'est ce que j'ai dit.
Je pense que
vous avez menti.
Ah bon ?
Vous avez menti
pour la bonne cause.
Il y a un certain temps nous avions eu
une conversation sur Dieu.
On ne choisit pas Dieu.
Dieu nous choisit.
Je me souviens.
Et vous avez dit que vous vouliez
que Dieu vous choisisse
mais qu'il était trop tard.
C'est jamais trop tard.
Dieu vous a
enfin choisi, Chris.
Et il a bien choisi.
Vous avez deux minutes.
Désolé, je peux pas
te prendre dans mes bras.
Schillinger a cru Cloutier.
Il pense que je suis innocent.
- Il m'a même serré la main.
- Tu vois ?
Et je gagne un beau voyage
dans le Massachusetts,
on me juge, je fais perpète
à Cedar Junction, loin de Schillinger.
Il y a des Aryens
dans le Massachusetts.
Pas des vrais.
En plus, je pense avoir prouvé que je
me débrouille bien pour rester en vie.
Pourquoi tu fais ça ?
J'aurais pensé
que c'étais assez évident.
- Ouais.
- De plus, j'aime l'ironie du sort.
J'me suis pas fait épingler pour tous
les autres meurtres que j'ai commis
et j'en avoue un
dont je suis innocent.
C'est l'heure, messieurs.
A bientôt.
Quand ?
Ici.
Ou au paradis.
Tu penses vraiment
qu'on va aller au paradis ?
Toi et moi, ensemble.
Dieu n'a pas les couilles
pour nous empêcher d'entrer.
Le pire des coups de poignard
est celui au cœur.
Bien sûr, la plupart des gens survivent,
mais le cœur n'est plus le même.
Y'a toujours une cicatrice, qui est là
je suppose, pour vous rappeler que
même pour un instant, quelqu'un a fait
battre votre cœur plus vite.
Et c'est une blessure avec laquelle
vous pouvez vivre fièrement
tous les jours de votre vie.
Un blizzard est sur son chemin.
Une tonne de neige
va tomber du ciel
et va tout enterrer : les trottoirs,
les voitures, les maisons.
Le sol sera gelť
et glissant, dangereux.
Mais ici ŗ Oz, nous sommes
oublieux de la mťtťo.
Ici ŗ Oz, nous sommes au chaud
et ŗ nos aises.
Merde.
Cyril ? Eh, Áa va ?
Mes cheveux ont encore changť.
Oh, merde. Regarde Áa.
Et ma peau.
Je suis pas ridť.
Allez, allez.
Aucun des neuf
autres prisonniers
ne montre d'effets secondaires
en prenant le mťdicament.
Depuis l'arrÍt des tests,
leurs corps sont redevenus normaux.
Oh, Dieu merci.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- Le cafť est prÍt ?
- Ouais.
Super. J'espŤre qu'on va pas
en manquer.
La tťlť dit qu'on attend
une grosse tempÍte.
Avec notre chance,
on va Ítre enneigť sans cafť.
Des nouvelles de McManus ?
Ouais. Je suis passťe
ŗ l'hŰpital.
Il est de bonne humeur.
Le docteur a dit qu'il devrait
revenir la semaine prochaine.
Bien.
Ouah, que de bonnes nouvelles.
Dr. Nathan ? Jeffrey Sykes.
Que puis-je
pour vous, M. Sykes ?
Je suis avocat chez Downing,
McNally & Dima.
La Corporation Wygert
a embauchť ma firme
pour les litiges concernant
la pilule de vieillissement.
Les litiges ?
La famille du prisonnier mort,
Fred Wick,
attaque en justice
pour $25 millions.
Vous Ítes nommťe ŗ la dťfense.
- Moi ?
- Du calme.
Les Wick transigeront
avant jugement.
Le plus gros problŤme est
avec la Commission d'Ethique,
qui reste un groupe
moins prťvisible.
Ils veulent vous voir
pour dťterminer
s'il y a eu nťgligence
pendant le test.
Vous voulez dire...
Oui, vous pourriez
perdre votre licence.
Est-il vrai qu'on veut vous forcer
ŗ dťmissionner ?
- Dr. Nathan...
- Avez-vous suivi le protocole ?
40 cm de neige
sur les trois prochains jours.
Avec -20 degrťs et des vents
ŗ 50 kilomŤtres par heure,
la circulation matinale...
O'Reily, t'as de la visite.
- Qui ?
- Je sais pas. Une nana.
Qui Ítes-vous ?
- Suzanne Fitzgerald.
- On se connaÓt ?
Oui, mais on ne s'est pas vus
depuis que tu ťtais tout petit.
…coutez, je fais pas vraiment
dans la nostalgie,
alors, qu'est-ce que
vous me voulez ?
Ryan, je suis venue parce que j'avais
quelque chose ŗ te dire,
quelque chose que tu risques
de trouver incomprťhensible.
Essayez.
Je suis ta mŤre.
- Ma mŤre est morte.
- Non, je suis ta vraie mŤre.
La femme que tu pensais Ítre ta...
Ma mŤre est morte !
Ah, enfin !
Putain.
J'ai cru que t'allais
y passer les fÍtes !
Eh, y'a des trucs
qui me travaillent.
Comme si Áa m'intťressait.
Tu sais, Howell,
t'es une vraie conne.
On se dispute comme
un vieux couple mariť.
Tu sais, O'Reily,
c'est le problŤme...
y'a plus d'excitation.
«a veut dire quoi ?
On arrÍte ?
Ouais. Il est temps de bouger
vers d'autres aventures.
Oh, Áa me fend le cúur.
Il ťtait temps. J'ai la dalle.
Alvin, tu fais que Áa, manger.
Et alors ?
Je suis censť garder
mes formes ?
Hughes, la bouffe est arrivťe.
Va te faire foutre !
Salut, blondinet.
T'as peur de moi ?
Tu n'as pas ŗ avoir peur.
Je suis amie avec ton frŤre.
J'aimerais Ítre
aussi ton amie.
Vous pouvez pas me faire Áa !
Dťgage ! Non !
L'Agent Howell dit que
ton frŤre l'a frappťe sans raison.
- Cette salope ment.
- Je lui ai donnť un sťdatif.
- Il dormira ŗ l'infirmerie ce soir.
- On est de retour au mÍme problŤme.
- On ne peut rien faire d'autre.
- Je ne comprends pas.
Cyril devrait Ítre transfťrť
au Conley Institute.
L'asile ? Non. «a m'ťtonnerait.
On attendra que McManus
rentre pour dťcider.
John, fais-le sortir !
Gloria, ne les laissez pas faire.
Il n'y survivra pas.
Gloria, je suis sťrieux !
- Salut, Papa.
- Putain, qu'est-ce qu'il neige.
Ils disent qu'on pourrait avoir
40 cm jeudi.
Merci d'avoir fait
l'effort de venir.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
Ils veulent envoyer Cyril
chez les dingues.
- Et ?
- Et ?
S'il part dans ce taudis
tout seul, il est fini.
C'est quoi la diffťrence ?
C'est qu'un autre taudis.
Oui, mais ŗ Oz, je suis lŗ.
Et t'as ťtť une si grande force
du bien dans sa vie, pas vrai ?
Va te faire voir.
C'est tout toi.
Tu ne m'as pas appelť pour Cyril.
Y'a une autre merde.
Accouche, parce que
les routes vont s'empirer.
Suzanne Fitzgerald.
Elle est venue. Elle dit
qu'elle est ma vraie mŤre.
Cette salope n'est qu'une menteuse !
Tu m'entends ?
- Putain ! C'est vrai.
- Il faut que j'y aille.
C'est vrai, hein, Papa ?
C'est vrai !
Le devoir d'un fils
est de protťger sa mŤre,
de n'importe qui,
mÍme de son propre pŤre.
La femme que je croyais
Ítre ma mŤre,
je sais qu'elle ne m'a jamais aimť.
Je sais pourquoi maintenant.
Et Suzanne Fitzgerald ?
Je crois que c'est ma mŤre.
Mais je l'ai lourdťe,
et je ne sais pas
comment la trouver.
Je peux peut-Ítre la trouver.
C'est vrai ?
Vous feriez Áa pour moi ?
Et cette connerie pour Cyril,
vous allez aussi
vous en occuper ?
Ryan, je ne peux rien promettre.
Ce n'est pas ma dťcision.
Mais vous plaiderez
pour moi, hein ?
- Ryan...
- S'il vous plaÓt.
Ne les laissez pas
nous sťparer.
Ryan ?
- Comment Áa va, champion ?
- Mieux.
Je sais que vous ferez
ce qui est juste.
- Comment Áa va, Clayton ?
- «a va.
- Qui sont les hommes de ton bloc ?
- Des flics.
L'un ťtait un stup infiltrť,
- l'autre un pťquenaud.
- Au moins, tu es sauf.
Il faut que t'arrÍtes
de t'inquiťter pour moi.
Je suis plus un petit garÁon.
Je sais.
Toi et Leo, vous m'avez toujours traitť
comme de la faÔence de Chine,
comme si j'allais casser
au premier toucher,
parce que Papa s'est fait buter comme
un con quand j'avais sept ans.
Clayton, ne parle pas
de ton pŤre comme Áa.
Je veux dire que tu ťtais bien
trop couveuse.
Tu aurais voulu quoi ? Que je te laisse
traÓner avec les gangs ?
Oui. Au moins,
j'aurais pu me trouver
des couilles plus vite.
Oh, et tu les a trouvťes en tirant
sur le gouverneur ?
Pour la premiŤre fois,
je sais qui je suis,
ma vraie personne,
la raison pour laquelle je suis nť.
Je peux changer le monde.
Mais coincť dans l'Unitť J,
je ne peux rien faire...
tout du moins pas tout de suite.
Comment Áa ?
Clayton, qu'est-ce que
tu vas faire ?
Rien.
T'inquiŤte pas.
Courrier !
Une autre lettre
de ta femme, Basil.
Elle a l'air de pire en pire.
Tu devrais la laisser
te rendre visite.
Merci pour tes conseils, Robson.
Avec plaisir.
Quelques magazines pour toi :
"Newsweek",
"Champs et RiviŤres",
"Gros Nichons".
J'aime que ma lecture
soit variťe.
Regarde-moi
la chatte page 15.
Oh, eh, rien pour toi
aujourd'hui, le dur.
Va te faire foutre.
- Ah oui ?
- Sale petite merde !
Oh, pas encore.
Assez, Robson !
OK. A plus, poupťe.
Va te faire foutre,
sale enculť de Nazi de merde !
Clayton, si tu continues, il va falloir
que je te mette la fessťe.
Attention,
il pourrait aimer Áa.
- Connard !
- Mets Hughes dans sa cellule !
Enculť ! Merde !
Dťtachez-moi !
Apprends d'abord ŗ courir
sans ciseaux !
Il faut faire un truc
pour Hughes, Alvin.
On a essayť d'Ítre copains.
Faut faire autre chose.
Comme quoi, le faire bouillir
dans de l'huile ?
On devrait parler au directeur,
pour que Hughes soit
transfťrť en isolement.
Ce gars est comme
un fils pour Glynn.
Tu mettrais
ton fils en isolement ?
Mon fils.
Il faut...
Laissez-moi vous montrer.
Merci.
John, entrez.
Le bureau est super.
J'espŤre que vous voulez pas
un nouveau micro-onde.
Clayton Hughes.
Je voulais descendre au J
pour parler ŗ Clayton.
J'ai juste ťtť occupť.
Comment va votre femme ?
«a va. Et la vŰtre ?
Je n'ai pas vu Abby
depuis mon procŤs.
Pourquoi pas ?
Je suis trop... humiliť.
John,
ťcoutez, je suis bien le dernier
ŗ pouvoir conseiller
en matiŤre de mariage.
Mais croyez-moi,
il faut pas la repousser.
Si vous le faites trop,
elle ne sera plus lŗ pour vous.
Abby... ?
Viens, s'il te plaÓt...
bientŰt.
Il fait froid. Vous avez froid ?
Mets un putain de pull.
Quand est-ce que
Busmalis se marie ?
- Demain.
- C'est ce que je pensais.
On ne devrait pas
faire quelque chose ?
- Comme quoi ?
- Je sais pas.
- Enterrer sa vie de garÁon.
- Ici, ŗ Oz ?
Il nous faut de l'alcool
et des stripteaseuses.
On a ni l'un ni l'autre.
OK. Je pensais juste...
demain est un grand jour
pour Busmalis...
Oubliez que j'en ai parlť.
- Keller lui manque.
- Pas moi.
Redabow,
vous Ítes le tťmoin ?
Ce mariage est vťreux.
Allez, Cyril. On y va.
T'imagines, demain
ŗ la tombťe de la nuit,
je serai un homme mariť.
Je le suis pas, hein ?
- Quoi ?
- Trop vieux pour me marier.
Non.
Tu crois pas
que je suis fou, hein ?
Il faut Ítre un peu fou
pour se marier,
mais c'est une bonne folie.
OK. Mais comme t'as dit
quand je t'ai dit...
comment Áa va Ítre,
elle dehors, moi dedans ?
On ne peut mÍme pas
consommer nos voeux.
Je t'ai gardť une petite surprise.
Je me suis arrangť avec Soeur Pete
pour que Norma et toi
puissiez utiliser, pour votre nuit
de noces seulement,
une des vieilles chambres
d'hospitalitť.
Les visites conjugales
ne sont plus permises.
Soeur Pete a tirť quelques ficelles.
Norma et moi allons
"suivre le chemin de Cupidon".
- Il n'y a plus qu'un truc.
- Quoi donc ?
Il va falloir que
tu me dises quoi faire
dans le lit avec Norma.
Tu vois, je suis vierge.
O'Reily a raison.
Ce mariage est vťreux.
Elle va arriver dans la minute.
Oui, dans la minute.
Dans la seconde.
- Elle n'est pas tant en retard.
- Non, que 45 minutes.
«a va encore.
En plus, je suis sŻr
qu'avec la neige,
la circulation est...
«a doit Ítre bouchť.
La neige. Bien sŻr.
Elle a peut-Ítre un pneu crevť.
Ou un problŤme de carburateur.
Elle a entendu un bruit bizarre
dans son moteur.
Ah, voilŗ.
Pete, vous lui avez parlť ?
J'ai appelť chez Norma
et j'ai eu son rťpondeur.
J'ai appelť le studio oý ils tournent
"L'…cole de Miss Sally",
et un homme trŤs gentil m'a dit
qu'il ne l'avait pas vue aujourd'hui.
Ma douce a pris sa journťe
pour m'ťpouser.
Elle va arriver dans la minute.
Ouais.
Mais avec la neige...
Pete, on en a dťjŗ parlť.
Vous Ítes trŤs beau.
Merci. C'est le plus beau jour
de ma vie.
Vous voulez vraiment
vous convertir ?
Oui, mon PŤre.
Je ne veux pas qu'on pense
que je vous pousse
dans cette direction.
Ce que les autres pensent
compte vraiment ?
Je sais dans mon cúur que
je veux Ítre baptisť catholique.
Le Rťvťrend Cloutier...
Ce qu'il dit ou fait
ne m'intťresse plus.
OK.
D'accord, Samuel,
nous ferons la cťrťmonie
samedi prochain.
Merci, mon PŤre.
Merci, Samuel.
"On mena Daniel
hors de l'antre,
et on ne lui dťcouvrit
aucune blessure,
parce qu'il croyait en son Dieu.
Et le roi..."
"Ordonna que...
On amena ces hommes
qui avaient accusť Daniel
et on les plaÁa
dans l'antre des lions".
Rťvťrend ?
Oui, mon PŤre ?
J'espŤre que vous n'Ítes pas f‚chť
que Samuel Gougeon
ait dťcidť de devenir catholique.
Si par f‚chť, vous voulez dire
en colŤre, non.
Mais j'ai peur pour son ‚me.
Son ‚me ira bien. Croyez-moi.
Croire. C'est ŗ Áa que
Áa se rťsume, hein ?
Vous Ítes bon joueur.
Je vous accorderai Áa.
Vous prťfŤreriez que je sois
rouge de colŤre,
dťvorť par la jalousie ?
Non, Áa, c'est votre jeu.
Mon jeu ?
Quand Timmy a quittť
votre ťglise pour la mienne,
vous avez tenu les scores...
celui qui sauve le plus d'‚mes gagne.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Votre tÍte n'a pas acceptť
ce que votre cúur sait dťjŗ.
Vous baptisez Samuel Gougeon
par vengeance.
Robson...
J'ai besoin que tu t'occupes
d'un truc pour moi.
- T'as du fric ?
- Ouais.
Parle.
- Le patient s'appelle Samuel Gougeon.
- Causes ?
On l'a battu violemment, possible
traumatisme cr‚nien.
- J'ai besoin de compresses.
- Tout de suite.
OK, tournez-vous.
Laissez-moi regarder.
Comment avez-vous pu ?
Comment avez-vous pu faire battre
Samuel Gougeon ?
Mukada, je ne ferais jamais
chose pareille.
Ce qui est arrivť ŗ Samuel
est un anathŤme.
Vous dÓtes que cette agression
est une coÔncidence ?
Je prie que ce soit le cas.
Sinon...
et si un membre de
ma congrťgation est responsable,
- il sera puni.
- Ouais. Rendez-moi service.
C'est moi qui m'occupe
des punitions, pigť ?
Bien sŻr.
Tim, dis-moi la vťritť.
Dis-moi si tu es impliquť.
Oui.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi le faire battre ?
Matthieu 26:24,
"Malheur ŗ cet homme par qui
le Fils de l'Homme est livrť.
Il eut ťtť bon pour cet homme-lŗ
qu'il ne fŻt pas nť".
C'est ce que vous avez dit.
Mais tu as mal interprťtť
leur signification.
Gougeon devait Ítre puni pour avoir
tournť le dos au Seigneur.
Je voulais juste vous donner
mon calendrier
pour libťrer la cafťtťria
pour le Ramadan.
Vous n'Ítes venu que pour Áa ?
Oui.
Et rien d'autre ?
J'ai fait la prťsomption
que le Rťvťrend Cloutier...
- Qu'il ťtait bidon.
- Ce n'est pas le cas.
Tout a commencť quand Timmy Kirk
a voulu se convertir.
Je pensais que Kirk
cťlŤbrerait le Christ
par la vraie foi.
Mais s'il trouve
son bonheur ailleurs,
devrais-je me battre pour garder
son ‚me dans mon coin,
en croyant ce que je crois,
que la foi qu'il a choisie
est fausse,
ou devrais-je juste Ítre heureux
qu'il ait trouvť l'amour de Dieu...
quel que soit l'endroit ?
Le prophŤte a dit : "Qu'il n'y ait pas
de contrainte en religion.
Chaque ‚me voyage seule".
On doit mener et on doit suivre.
C'est impossible.
Si servir Allah ťtait facile,
tout le monde le ferait.
Rťvťrend, je me disais
que ce serait un bon moment
pour un service oecumťnique.
Formidable.
Je pensais la mÍme chose.
Mon PŤre, je vous ai accusť
d'Ítre dťvorť par l'envie.
Je l'ťtais.
Mais moi aussi.
Nos pťchťs sont notre lien.
La maison de Dieu a
de nombreuses piŤces.
Si une personne choisit de bouger
d'une piŤce ŗ l'autre,
nous qui restons derriŤre
devons nous assurer que la piŤce
dans laquelle nous sommes
n'est pas vide.
La prťsence de Dieu
remplit chaque piŤce.
L'amour de Dieu brille
dans toute la maison.
Prions.
Currier & Ives,
Norman Rockwell...
ils ont crťť des images
de l'Amťrique sous l'hiver.
Patin ŗ glace sur un lac :
promenades en luge
sur les routes de campagne,
les cristaux blancs
de la neige fraÓche.
Peut-Ítre y a-t-il eu une ťpoque
oý la vie ťtait idyllique
et les enfants n'allaient pas ŗ l'ťcole
pour en tuer d'autres.
On voit les peintures maintenant
et on devient nostalgique...
nostalgique d'un endroit
qu'on n'a jamais vu.
On rÍve d'une ťpoque
dont on n'a pas fait parti.
J'ai l'impression d'avoir
touchť le fond,
une autre trappe s'ouvre et je plonge
encore plus dans le dťsespoir.
Dieu nous donne autant de souffrance
qu'on peut en supporter.
Il entasse la merde pour voir
si on va rompre ?
- Pourquoi ?
- Pour tester notre foi,
et nous faire apprťcier
les choses que nous avons.
Excusez-moi de dire Áa,
Rťvťrend,
- mais Dieu est un bon connard.
- Vern...
La femme de Hank,
Carrie, va arriver.
Elle vient me voir rťguliŤrement
depuis la disparition de Hank,
depuis le jour oý elle m'a dit
que j'allais Ítre grand-pŤre.
Chaque visite, je lui dis :
"Ne t'inquiŤte pas,
Hank va bientŰt rentrer".
Il faut que je lui dise qu'il rentrera
demain dans une boÓte.
Te voilŗ.
Bonjour.
Je suis dťsolťe
d'Ítre en retard.
Il a fallu que je gratte la glace
sur le pare-brise.
Tu te sens bien ?
Je me sens grosse.
Qu'a dit le docteur ?
Je pourrais accoucher
plus tŰt que prťvu.
Carrie, j'ai des nouvelles,
et elles ne sont pas bonnes.
Mais il faut Ítre forte,
pour le bťbť.
- OK ?
- D'accord.
Hank... a ťtť tuť.
Il... Il est mort ?
Oui.
Merde...
Oh, merde.
Non !
Non, non, non... !
Non, non, non... !
Non ! Non !
Oh, mon Dieu...
- «a va aller.
- Non, Áa ne va pas aller !
Comment ? Hein, dites-moi.
Comment je vais vivre
avec un bťbť et sans mari ?
Oh, mon Dieu... merde... !
Oh, mon Dieu !
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Je sais pas.
Faites venir un docteur, et vite !
Chef, ici 41. Il nous faut
un 68 dans la salle de visites.
Oh, merde ! AÔe !
- Carrie...
- «a fait mal !
Carrie, respirez. Focalisez-vous
sur votre respiration.
- Soufflez. Respirez.
- Il ne sort pas.
Il sort. Je vois la tÍte.
A trois, je veux que
poussez bien fort.
Un, deux, trois, poussez !
Putain, Áa fait mal !
- Continuez de pousser.
- Allez vous faire voir !
Je vois la tÍte, Carrie.
Je vois la tÍte.
Oh, le voilŗ. Le voilŗ.
Voilŗ.
Non. Non. Non !
Laisse-moi. Non. Non !
Matricule 01G359,
Colonel Edward Galson,
condamnť le 16 fťvrier 2001.
Viol, agression.
Sentence : 15 ans,
possibilitť de sursis
dans sept ans.
Voici Tobias Beecher.
Il t'aidera ŗ t'habituer
ŗ ta nouvelle vie.
Beecher, voici Edward Galson.
- Salut.
- C'est par oý ?
Par lŗ.
J'ai vu un truc
sur toi aux infos.
T'as violť un officier
pendant un salon militaire ?
Je suis dans les Marines
depuis l'‚ge de 16 ans,
et j'ai suivi
leur code d'ťthique.
Une nuit,
j'ai manquť ŗ ce code
et je suis correctement puni.
Tu changeras peut-Ítre d'avis
aprŤs deux-trois jours ŗ Oz.
J'ai l'habitude d'Ítre
avec des hommes.
Je suis habituť ŗ la rigueur.
Je n'aurai pas
de problŤme ŗ m'adapter.
Tout va bien, alors.
Prťfťrez-vous
qu'on vous appelle Ed,
Edward, Eddie ?
En fait,
je prťfŤre "colonel".
D'accord, Colonel.
Parlez-nous
de votre dťpendance.
Je ne pense pas que Áa en soit une.
Je ne bois pas si souvent.
Je vois. Mais quand vous buvez trop,
que se passe-t-il ?
J'ai perdu le contrŰle une fois.
«a ne se renouvellera pas.
C'est facile ŗ dire.
Plus dur ŗ faire.
Pour un homme faible, oui.
OK, ouais, j'ai ťtť faible,
et plus d'une fois. Je suis
probablement toujours un faible,
mais au moins
j'ai les couilles de l'admettre.
«a suffit, Tobias.
OK, tout le monde.
On se voit la semaine prochaine.
John Carpenter
joue pour $100 000.
- John, bienvenue.
- Merci.
Nous avons quelqu'un ici
pour vous aider,
dont le personnage
"Miles Silverberg"
dans la sťrie
"Murphy Brown"...
"Murphy Brown",
c'ťtait marrant.
Mesdames et messieurs, Grant Shaud.
Grant, bienvenue.
- Les nichons de Candice Bergen...
- L'autre fille ťtait mignonne.
Lily Tomlin ?
Voici la question :
Quel pays comprend le plus de gens
qui parlent anglais ?
L'Amťrique !
Non, l'Angleterre, crťtin.
...les USA mais pour $100 000, Áa...
Áa peut pas Ítre aussi simple.
- Grant ?
- Voici mon indice :
On peut trouver une critique
de ce pays dans un livre rouge.
- La Chine.
- Je savais pas.
J'ai une grande croyance
dans les faux journalistes, Gordon.
Donc, je dirais la Chine.
Eh bien, John, Áa pourrait
ne pas vous surprendre,
mais il y a plus de Chinois
que d'Amťricains
qui comprendront ce que je dis :
vous avez gagnť $100 000.
Ce con de Beecher
a toujours les rťponses.
Tu devrais participer
ŗ l'ťmission.
C'est Áa. "Bonjour,
je m'appelle Tobias Beecher.
Je suis en prison
pour meurtre d'enfant.
OK, jouons
ŗ 'Augmentez Votre Mise'!"
Tobias, je vous prťsente
Katherine McClain.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Elle est avocate ŗ l'Alliance
des Droits des Prisonniers,
et elle voudrait parler.
Venez et asseyez-vous.
M. Beecher, vous savez que
vous arrivez ŗ votre sursis ?
Quand j'ai ťtť condamnť,
je savais que je ferais
au moins quatre ans.
Mais en toute considťration,
je pensais que mon dossier
annulerait mes chances
de libťration anticipťe.
Peut-Ítre.
Mais j'ai regardť votre cas,
et je pense que les circonstances
attťnuantes...
la mort de votre femme
et votre fils :
votre fille, et le besoin
qu'elle a de vous :
votre meilleur comportement
ces six derniers mois :
les recommandations de Soeur Peter
Marie et du Dr. Nathan...
pourraient motiver
une libťration conditionnelle.
Ils vous laisseront partir.
Je...
Tobias ?
«a va.
- Que dois-je faire ?
- Donnez-moi l'autorisation,
et j'entamerai les dťmarches.
Et restez ŗ l'abri des ennuis.
Il paraÓt que t'es pťdť.
Qu'est-ce que
Áa peut te faire ?
Je ne voudrais pas
que t'aies des idťes la nuit.
Crois-moi, je suis pas
dťsespťrť ŗ ce point.
Tant qu'on se comprend.
Les pťdťs dťtruisent l'armťe.
La politique du chacun
pour soi, mon cul.
Je suis d'accord.
Je pense que l'armťe devrait rester
ce qu'elle a toujours ťtť,
une bande de pťquenauds qui tuent
les gosses et violent les femmes.
Tu te fous de ma gueule ?
Je pense que t'y arrives
bien tout seul.
Fils de...
Attendez. Putain, non.
Gardes... merde.
Vous comprenez pas.
Attendez. Je suis dťsolť.
Je peux m'expliquer, connards !
Putain de merde...
Merde ! Putain de merde !
Merde !
Fahrenheit et Celsius,
deux faÁons de mesurer
la mÍme chose.
La majeure partie du monde
utilise les Celsius,
mais nous Amťricains, restons fidŤles
avec dťfiance aux Fahrenheit.
On aimerait apprendre l'autre faÁon...
on aimerait changer.
Mais on a du mal ŗ accepter
que zťro degrť soit en fait plus chaud
que ce qu'on pense.
Alors, Jackson,
pourquoi on vous a
envoyť en prison ?
Vous avez le dossier sous les yeux.
Vous voulez pas
le dire vous-mÍme ?
- Agression.
- Quoi d'autre ?
C'est des conneries.
Ce n'est pas facile
de le dire, hein ?
- Et ?
- Et c'est bien.
«a prouve que vous n'Ítes pas
fier de votre acte.
Non, c'est juste que je n'ai pas fait
ce que cette salope a dit.
Je ne l'ai pas violťe.
Elle l'a fait volontairement.
OK, je veux vous revoir demain.
Pourquoi ?
Cette merde m'aide pas.
Eh bien, moi, Áa m'aide.
Voyez-vous, Jackson,
j'ai des quotas ŗ remplir.
Je dois voir un certain nombre
de prisonniers chaque jour
ou l'…tat ne me paie pas.
Jackson, on vous a testť
pour drogues
juste avant l'audience
et vous ťtiez nťgatif.
Il faut que je vous reteste ?
Non.
Je vous crois...
pour l'instant.
Redding,
je viens pour me plaindre.
La merde que Poet
m'a vendue hier a ťtť coupťe.
J'arrive pas ŗ planer
comme d'hab.
Le problŤme, c'est pas le produit,
c'est le consommateur.
Je te parle ? J'ai besoin
d'un truc meilleur.
Ce que Poet essaie de te dire
dans son propre style,
c'est que tu sniffes
tellement par jour,
plus la taille de ton corps,
tu as dťveloppť
une rťsistance.
Au moins, il rťsiste
ŗ quelque chose.
La ferme ! Donne-m'en plus.
Plus ne fera que te tuer.
Non, tu as besoin
d'un meilleur moyen de...
- C'est quoi le mot ?
- Ingťrer.
Ingťrer.
Seulement fais gaffe
oý tu le plantes.
Faut pas laisser de marques.
- Quoi, dans ma langue ?
- Ou derriŤre le genou.
Extinction des feux !
Numťro 17, Jackson Vahue.
Mes jambes ont fait de moi
un joueur de basket.
Je sais que
je ne jouerai plus en pro,
alors de la merde, hein ?
Plus rien ŗ foutre.
Mais en fait, j'en ai ŗ foutre.
Ces jambes m'ont toujours portť.
J'ai fait quelque chose de ma vie.
Je veux pas oublier Áa.
Je suis fier de ces jambes.
Quoi de neuf, bouffon ?
Matricule 01D251,
Carlton Daniels,
alias "Tug" Daniels.
Condamnť le 20 fťvrier 2001.
Tentative d'assassinat.
Sentence : 28 ans.
Possibilitť de sursis
dans 14 ans.
Le temps de l'action est arrivť.
Tug,
tu t'occupes de Pancamo.
OK.
Je veux Morales.
Pourquoi veux-tu
autant le tuer ?
J'ai fait la promesse
de venger la mort
de Bian Yixue.
Augustus, je veux
que tu fasses dire
ŗ Omar White ŗ l'hŰpital
qu'il doit achever
Supreme Allah.
Eh, Burr, ťcoute,
j'ai rťflťchi
ŗ notre petite guerre.
Il y a des hommes bons
qui vont mourir.
Beaucoup qui vont
mourir tout court.
Mais disons que tu gagnes,
tu vas y gagner quoi ?
Les gardiens vont boucler
toute la prison.
On ne pourra pas garder Áa
secret ťternellement.
Le directeur va dťcouvrir que t'es
le chef, et t'enverra en isolement.
Augustus, quel est ton putain
de problŤme ?
Tu ťtais le meilleur ami
de mon pŤre, pas vrai ?
Vous Ítes allťs au Vietnam,
et t'es revenu tout seul.
Et depuis, je t'ai suivi.
J'ai fait ce que tu m'as dit
sans poser de question.
Alors maintenant
t'as des questions.
Quand j'avais 10 ans,
je voulais un vrai boulot.
- Tu voulais livrer des journaux.
- Exact.
Au lieu de Áa, tu m'as fait
vendre de la came.
- Il faut bien apprendre le business.
- Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi je devais apprendre
ŗ vendre de la drogue ?
Parce qu'on n'avait pas le choix.
Laisse-moi te dire un truc.
Je ne m'excuserai pas pour
ce que je suis ou ce que j'ai fait.
Est-ce que j'aurais aimť des choses
meilleures ? Bien sŻr.
Est-ce que j'aurais
aimť Ítre bien nť
sur un beau boulevard ?
Bien sŻr.
Mais je n'ai pas d'espoir
et pas de rÍve.
Je fais ma merde
dans ce monde,
je vois la rťalitť et je fais
du mieux avec.
Ne me parle pas de rťalitť.
Je vis ŗ Oz.
Je vis dans cette chaise.
Et je ne serais pas ici
si tu m'avais laissť
livrer des putain de journaux.
Cet homme est comme
un pŤre pour moi.
Il arrive un temps oý le fils
quitte la maison du pŤre.
Oý il prend sa propre route.
Mais je ne peux pas le trahir.
Penses-tu que
ce qu'il manigance est mauvais ?
En grande partie, oui.
Penses-tu que beaucoup
de gens souffriront ?
Oui.
Tu sais, Augustus,
je t'ai toujours admirť,
tu sais Ítre toi-mÍme,
tu sais garder...
surtout dans cet endroit...
un sens de la dťcence
et de l'honneur.
Qu'est-ce que
Áa m'a apportť de bien ?
Va dormir.
Il faut qu'on parle.
- Ben, vas-y.
- En privť.
- Eh, mon frŤre.
- Tu veux quoi ?
- Un peu d'eau.
- J'suis pas infirmier.
Allez. J'ai soif. S'il te plaÓt.
Mmm, Áa fait du bien.
«a fait du bien.
Plus haut...
plus haut, ma poule !
Eh, lance la balle.
- Ne rťsiste pas.
- OK, OK, OK.
Bouclage !
Quand j'ťtais gosse,
j'adorais lire Jack London.
Vous savez, "L'Appel de la ForÍt",
"Croc Blanc".
Je me souviens d'une histoire
oý un homme ťtait en Alaska,
ou ailleurs, isolť et au froid.
Il avait perdu ses chiens,
ses jambes ťtaient cassťes,
il savait qu'il allait
mourir de froid.
Il s'enterra sous la neige
et s'endormit.
Terrifiant et beau
en mÍme temps.
Accepter son destin,
c'est comme Áa
qu'un homme devrait mourir.
Giles, debout.
Nous sommes ŗ un mois de la date
donnťe par la Cour pour votre exťcution.
Vous devez dťcider
comment vous voulez partir.
Mourir vieux...
dormir ?
Ouais, ce n'est pas une option.
Peter Marie.
Je lui demanderai de vous voir.
Eh, arrÍte de pleurer.
«a va me dťprimer.
ArrÍte de chialer, merde !
Et enfin il y a le gaz.
On vous met dans une petite salle
et on l‚che une capsule
de cyanure de sodium...
Vos poumons se remplissent
et c'est la fin.
Droguť ?
Je ne sais pas
si Áa fait cet effet.
Pierres.
Je ne comprends pas.
- Lancer.
- Une minute...
Vous voulez Ítre lapidť ?
Shirley Jackson ?
MoÔse, ťcoute-moi.
Je suis ton avocate,
il faut que je te dise
que tu risques une autre
condamnation ŗ mort.
On fera aussi appel.
Oui, mais le CongrŤs a placť
beaucoup de limites
sur ces appels.
Ce qui veut dire ?
Que tu seras
probablement exťcutť
pour un crime ou les deux.
Tu dois te prťparer pour
ce qui pourrait se produire.
Je n'avais pensť ŗ Áa
parce que...
j'ai pas perdu espoir.
Je suis un homme de principes.
Et je crois au plus
profond de mon ‚me
qu'un homme
avec des principes sera...
sera disculpť.
Il est bon d'espťrer.
Mais au cas oý,
tu devrais te prťparer,
tout mettre en ordre.
Le Procureur Gťnťral
a refusť votre requÍte
d'Ítre exťcutť par lapidation.
Loi... droit, ŗ moi.
Un groupe anti-peine de mort a dťcidť
de poursuivre votre cause.
Ils vont attaquer l'…tat
en votre nom.
Ce bordel durera des dťcennies.
Peter... Peter Marie.
Extinction des feux !
Giles ? Giles ?
Tout ce temps, j'ai cru que
t'ťtais idiot ŗ parler comme Áa,
mais lŗ je vois que
t'es un putain de gťnie.
Non... gťnie, non.
Si, gťnie. Tu devais mourir
dans deux semaines.
Tes appels sont morts.
Mais en demandant la lapidation,
t'as dťglinguť la machine.
Tout le monde se poursuit en justice.
Et comme le dirlo a dit,
Áa pourrait prendre des annťes.
Mourir vieux... dormir ?
Giles, t'es une inspiration
pour nous tous.
Je me demande pourquoi tu voulais
que le directeur me voie.
Je viens de finir
de lire votre livre.
- C'est gťnial.
- Merci.
La section sur le couloir de la mort,
Jefferson Keane
qui donne son rein ŗ sa súur,
Áa m'a fait quelque chose.
J'ai toujours
des nouvelles de Grace.
Elle est trŤs heureuse, en forme.
Je voudrais faire la mÍme chose...
donner mes organes.
Laisser les autres utiliser mes organes
quand j'en aurai fini.
La seule chose...
je veux rencontrer les gens
que j'aiderai.
Je ne suis pas sŻr
que ce soit permis.
Vous pouvez m'aider, Said.
Je le sais.
Le pouvoir de la foi.
Je vais voir
ce que je peux faire.
Mon frŤre,
je suis comme toi.
Et je sais ce qu'est le besoin
d'Ítre un homme,
mais Áa s'accomplit pas en se droguant,
en se battant, ou en baisant sa meuf.
 tre un homme,
Áa commence lŗ.
- Salah fait un nouveau converti.
- Oui.
Il arrive ŗ parler aux gens
ŗ leur niveau.
Tu as fait du bon travail.
Leroy.
Tu veux quoi, Robson ?
Je suis un homme
patient et tolťrant.
Mais c'est pas le cas
de mon ami Jaz.
- Ouais.
- On avait un deal :
la moitiť en avance
pour tuer Kareem Said,
mais Said est toujours
parmi nous.
T'as dit que t'avais un plan
ŗ long terme pour l'approcher.
Jaz pense que trop de temps
s'est ťcoulť.
Tic-tac... Leroy.
Un, je ne m'appelle plus
Leroy Tidd.
Je m'appelle Salah Yudin.
Deux, j'ai promis de tuer Said,
mais j'ai changť d'avis.
Un, pour changer d'avis,
il faut avoir un cerveau.
Et Leroy... t'as de la merde
dans la tÍte.
Deux, tu ne trompes pas
la Fraternitť.
Me raconte pas cette merde.
Robson, tu veux faire
un petit tour au trou ?
- Euh, non.
- Alors, casse-toi.
C'est pas fini.
Salah, tu sembles soucieux.
- Mon ‚me est lourde.
- Parle-moi.
J'ai peur de dire la vťritť.
N'aie jamais peur de la vťritť,
mon frŤre.
Je vous ai menti.
Quand je vous ai abordť
pour vous dire que
je voulais devenir musulman,
mon cúur ťtait alimentť
par la vengeance
parce que vous avez tuť Adebisi.
Mais alors, la fťlicitť d'Allah
a remplacť la vengeance
et maintenant, je crois.
J'ai su le jour oý je t'ai reÁu
que tu mentais.
- Vous saviez ?
- Oui.
Alors, pourquoi... ?
Les voies du Seigneur
sont impťnťtrables.
Il nous a rassemblťs en ce moment,
ŗ cet endroit
pour que nous puissions
apprendre l'un de l'autre.
Vous avez appris de moi ?
Comment ?
Le jour oý j'ai jurť ma loyautť
envers Adebisi...
Depuis sa mort, je me bats
avec mes propres dťmons.
C'est toujours le cas...
mais tu m'as appris que le monde
offrait des tas de possibilitťs.
Robson et Hoyt
veulent vous voir mort.
- Je sais.
- Qu'allons-nous faire ?
Comme pour tout...
laissons cela
dans les mains de Dieu.
Si tu t'en occupes, tu rentreras
dans la Fraternitť.
Sinon, je les laisserai
te bouffer.
- Prends Áa !
- Merde. Je t'ai dit...
Je ferai ce qu'il faut.
Non ! Non !
Imam...
Salah est mort.
Je suis responsable de sa mort.
Je l'ai tuť
comme j'ai tuť Adebisi.
C'est comme si c'ťtait moi
qui tenait le couteau...
dans ces mains
ensanglantťes.
- Kareem...
- Non, ne dis rien.
- Vous n'Ítes pas ŗ bl‚mer.
- Laisse-moi...
parce que mes dťmons
ont besoin de manger.
Laisse-moi !
On dit que chaque
flocon est diffťrent,
mais comment
peut-on en Ítre sŻr ?
Pensez ŗ tous les flocons
qui sont tombťs
sur le monde dans l'histoire
de la Terre.
La loi des moyennes montre qu'au
moins deux ont dŻ Ítre similaires.
Comme les Ítres humains,
comme les hommes d'Oz...
mÍme s'ils arrivent uniques,
ils finissent tous pareil.
A l'époque de la Grèce Antique,
il y avait un homme
qui s'appelait Orphée.
Il aimait sa femme.
Il y allait mollo sur l'ouzo.
Il jouait de la guitare.
Un super mec.
Qu'est-ce que les dieux
tout-puissants lui ont fait ?
Ils l'ont fait chier, ont fait de sa vie
un Hadès. Pourquoi ?
C'est ce que les gens qui ont du pouvoir
font à ceux qui n'en ont pas.
Le temps de l'action est arrivé.
Tug, tu t'occupes de Pancamo.
On n'aime pas Burr Redding
plus que toi.
Tu le veux mort,
on le veut mort.
Je veux Morales.
Je suis resté
10 jours à l'hôpital.
J'aimerais penser que c'est
quand ce brouhaha a commencé,
mais j'ai le sentiment que
ça remonte à plus loin.
On a manqué de juste une guerre
majeure avec de gros dommages.
La question est :
et maintenant ?
Messieurs, je vais vous donner
quelques options.
Je peux vous mettre tous les deux
dans cette cage
ou vous pouvez
vous taper dessus
jusqu'à la mort du premier et
la condamnation du deuxième :
je peux vous transférer
dans des unités différentes,
où vous pourriez aussi vous tuer,
mais plus sous ma supervision :
ou on peut trouver
une forme de trêve.
Vous en dîtes quoi ?
La paix.
C'est une belle chose.
Serrez-vous la main, et que
tout le monde puisse vous voir.
Burr. Burr. Burr.
- Laisse-moi tranquille.
- Attends une minute.
Je sais que c'est toi l'indic.
Tu m'as trahi,
moi qui t'ai élevé
comme un fils.
Si tu étais quelqu'un d'autre,
tu serais mort.
Mais je vais te laisser vivre.
Vivre dans la honte.
Toi et moi, c'est fini.
Ouah. Recule, le jaune.
Tente pas ta chance avec moi.
Et c'est pas parce que Redding et toi
avez fait copain-copain
que je ne vais pas défoncer
ton cul de bouffeur de tacos.
Je t'ai dit de reculer.
Putain !
Ça fait 10 minutes que vous êtes sortis,
vous foutez déjà la merde.
Dans la cage.
Supreme Allah.
Je croyais que t'étais mort.
C'est marrant.
Je croyais la même chose pour toi.
Faut pas croire les rumeurs.
Comme celle qui dit que vous avez
signé un traité avec Redding.
- T'aurais fait quoi ?
- Je vais te dire ce que je vais faire.
Ce négro est fini.
On a essayé d'aérer cet enculé
depuis son arrivée.
Sans succès.
En plus, s'il meurt maintenant,
on aura les gardiens au cul.
Pas s'il se fait buter
par un des nôtres.
- Tu penses à qui ?
- Lui.
Augustus,
pourquoi tu manges pas
avec ton vieux pote Redding ?
Va te faire foutre, Ketchup.
Tu connais Omar White ?
Il a essayé de me tuer.
Tug Daniels, pareil.
Je suis toujours sur mes pattes.
Maintenant que Burr t'a éjecté,
il te faut un ami.
Ouais, et ça sera pas toi.
Écoute, je veux réparer
ce que je t'ai fait,
t'avoir mis dans
cette chaise, et à Oz.
Alors, souviens-toi,
à partir de maintenant,
je te protège.
Redding, voici ton nouveau
compagnon, le Colonel.
Je ne veux pas de compagnon.
On a dû perdre ta résa
pour une suite personnelle.
A quoi il pense McManus,
nous mettre ensemble toi et moi ?
Je sais pas.
Pourquoi il t'a appelé Colonel ?
Parce que c'est ce que je suis.
T'es un Marine.
Affirmatif.
Moi aussi, j'ai fait l'armée,
4ème cavalerie,
1ère division d'infanterie,
Vietnam.
Moi aussi,
j'ai fait le Vietnam,
3ème bataillon, 4ème Marines.
McManus n'est pas
aussi stupide que ça.
Mets-toi à l'aise.
Colonel,
je pourrais bien avoir
une petite mission pour toi...
Recherche et destruction.
Omar White
a récupéré physiquement.
Je voulais le renvoyer
en isolement aujourd'hui.
- Vous avez eu une session avec lui ?
- Oui.
Il est volatile, mais c'est en grande
partie dû à la drogue.
S'il peut rester clean,
on peut le sauver ?
- Tim, que voulez-vous...
- Je le ramène à Em City.
Tim, il vous a poignardé.
Raison de plus pour
que je fasse l'effort.
Salut, Omar.
Écoutez, je suis désolé
de vous avoir planté.
- Je ne sais pas ce qui m'arrive.
- Je te pardonne.
Vraiment ?
Tu aimerais revenir à Em City ?
Au lieu de l'isolement ?
Pas besoin
de demander deux fois.
Ça peut se faire,
mais sous certaines conditions.
Comment ça se fait que
t'es pas en isolement ?
McManus.
Il m'a pardonné.
- Ce con fume du shit.
- Tu m'étonnes.
La femme d'Orphée se promène,
se fait mordre
par un serpent et meurt.
Orphée pète un câble et
descend dans les tréfonds
pour demander
le retour de sa femme.
Un déesse lui dit :
"OK, à une condition.
Si tu la regardes avant ton retour
sur Terre, elle disparaîtra".
Plus que trois mètres à faire,
ce con se retourne,
et sa femme est renvoyée
droit aux enfers.
Orphée aurait dû savoir.
On se frotte pas aux dieux.
C'est ce que je lui ai dit, mais tu sais
comment sont les hommes.
Ouais, en fait...
T'as besoin d'un truc ?
C'est quoi comme nom Yood ?
Comment ça ?
C'est un nom de famille.
- Merde.
- On donne.
Quelle sorte
de nationalité, crétin !
- C'est américain.
- Y'a pas de noms américains, crétin.
- Arrête de m'appeler comme ça.
- Y'a pas d'Américains.
Ça y est, c'est reparti.
On vient tous
d'ailleurs à l'origine.
Mon nom est américain.
C'est crétin, ton nom !
Agent Howell.
- Quoi ?
- Faites votre boulot.
Je te rappelle.
- Tu recommences tes conneries ?
- Je fais juste la conversation.
Eh bien, ferme ta gueule !
Basil, tu prends
la défense de Yood ?
Ouais, pourquoi pas ?
A cause de ce qu'il est
et de ce qu'on est.
Ce que t'es, c'est un con.
Oh, Johnny.
Tu m'as tellement manqué.
Je ne savais pas à quel point
jusqu'à maintenant.
Chut. Ne pleure pas.
Asseyons-nous.
Je veux que tu rentres.
- Rentre.
- Tu sais que je ne peux pas.
Même si je le veux,
pas avant trois ans.
- J'y arriverai pas.
- Mais si.
Il le faut.
Pour Robby.
Et pour moi.
Le fait que tu m'attendes
me fait tenir, Abby.
Et un jour, toi, Robby et moi,
on sera à nouveau ensemble.
Et on rigolera.
Et on oubliera, OK ?
Amène Robby
la semaine prochaine.
Je suis prêt à voir mon fils.
- Basil.
- Ouais ?
Ton fils, il arrivera
à grandir sans père ?
Quoi ?
C'est qui le con, hein ?
Sale fils de pute !
Il se passe quoi ?
Ouvrez cette putain de porte !
Ouvrez la porte, fils de pute !
Ouvrez cette putain de porte !
Je rentre chez moi.
Je vous accompagne.
- Oh, je m'en occupe.
- Laissez.
- La tâche pourrait...
- Laissez !
Je veux voir ce verre cassé
demain matin
pour me rappeler
à quel point je suis saoul.
Vous ne pouvez pas conduire.
Qu'est-ce qui pourrait
arriver de pire ?
Que je finisse contre un arbre ?
Je vous appelle un taxi.
- Non.
- Alors je vous ramène.
John Basil et moi avions
beaucoup en commun.
De bonnes intentions...
qui finissent
par partir en couille.
Il m'a prévenu pour Clayton.
Je n'ai rien fait,
parce que je ne pouvais rien faire.
Allez. Je vous ramène à la maison.
J'adore la neige avant Noël,
et je peux la tolérer en janvier,
mais en février,
la neige, c'est redondant.
Bonjour à vous aussi.
Désolé. Bonjour, ma Soeur.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Keller me manque.
On ne peut pas s'appeler,
et s'il m'a écrit,
un des nazis du courrier
a dû détruire ses lettres.
Ou bien, il n'a pas écrit.
Il a pu trouver quelqu'un d'autre.
Ou il est mort.
Je contacterai le directeur
de psychiatrie à Cedar Junction
et je verrai comment va Keller.
J'essaierai d'arranger une conversation
téléphonique entre vous.
Ce serait super, ma Soeur.
Parce que depuis
qu'il est parti, je...
Je me sens...
Je sais pas,
pas mort, pas vide.
Vous savez, Tobias, vous avez
des raisons d'être heureux.
Votre fille reprend
un comportement normal,
Katherine McClain prépare
votre audience de sursis...
C'est ce qui me rend bizarre.
Si je sors, je serai qui ?
J'ai étudié votre dossier
avec Steve Dawkins.
Je dois dire que
je suis assez optimiste.
Vous croyez que j'ai une chance
de pouvoir sortir ?
Oui. Je pense que oui.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Katherine, je ne sais pas
comment vous remercier.
Ne me remerciez pas tant
que vous n'êtes pas sorti.
OK, mais si je sors,
je vous invite à dîner.
Le meilleur restaurant
de la ville, la totale.
J'aimerais bien.
Vous êtes mariée ?
- Je suis...
- Vous savez quoi ?
Vous n'avez pas à répondre.
Je devrais pas poser
de questions personnelles.
- Vous êtes mon avocate, bon sang.
- Stop.
C'est bon. Je connais les détails
de votre vie privée,
pourquoi pas le contraire ?
Je suis divorcée.
Des enfants ?
Un fils. Il a huit ans.
Le même âge qu'Holly.
- Je sais.
- Oh, oui. C'est vrai.
La fête est finie. On y va.
C'est le problème à Oz.
On ne peut jamais finir
une conversation.
On est loin d'avoir fini, Tobias.
OK, le voilà.
- Allô ?
- Chris ? Ici Soeur Pete.
- Je suis avec Tobias.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Le directeur Glynn et la personne
qui dirige Cedar Junction
ont accepté ce coup de fil
si je reste dans cette pièce
et que quelqu'un reste
avec vous aussi.
Donc, j'ai peur que
ce ne soit pas aussi...
intime que vous le voudriez.
Merci, ma Soeur.
Toby, comment ça va ?
Mieux. Et toi ?
Eh, moi, tu sais.
Je me fais de nouveaux amis,
je tâte le terrain.
Chris, je vais peut-être
obtenir mon sursis.
- Sans déconner ?
- Ouais.
Peut-être dans deux semaines.
Si c'est le cas, j'aimerais
monter au Massachusetts.
Eh, Toby, non.
Si tu as la chance de sortir,
tourne le dos à cette merde
et casse-toi.
Tu comprends ?
Casse-toi et mène ta vie.
- Tu me donnes un ordre ?
- Non.
Je suis sur mes genoux et
je te supplie, oublie-moi.
- Je raccroche.
- Chris.
Merci.
Nous voilà !
Laissez-moi la tenir.
Je n'ai pas pu la tenir
quand elle est née.
- Vous l'avez ?
- Oui, je la tiens.
OK, dis bonjour
à grand-père, Jewel.
Vous l'avez appelée Jewel ?
C'est un joyaux, non ?
Et Hank adorait sa chanson
"You were Meant for Me".
Jewel Schillinger.
Jewel.
Ouais, Vern,
elle est mignonne.
Elle s'appelle Jewel.
Jewel ?
Ça fait un peu juif
comme nom.
Eh, t'es Salinger ?
Schillinger.
Ouais.
J'ai connu ton fils, Hank.
- T'as connu mon fils ?
- Il paraît que t'es proxénète.
Et fier de l'être.
Mes filles sont les meilleures.
- Et mon fils ?
- Il était un peu juste,
il voulait louer sa petite amie.
- OK, écoute...
- Casey, Carrie, un truc comme ça.
- Une blonde mignonne.
- Sale menteur !
Attends une minute,
je veux pas de problèmes.
Mais je pensais que tu savais
que Hank louait sa salope.
Un ou deux potes à moi
se la sont tapée..
J'suis surpris que le bébé
soit pas café au lait.
Curtis Bennet
peut avoir menti.
Comment je peux
apprendre la vérité ?
Vous avez parlé à Carrie ?
Je ne peux pas la revoir
avant la semaine prochaine.
Elle a parlé à Sarah
à mon église.
Je demanderai à Sarah
si elle a parlé de son passé.
En attendant, soyez patient.
Patient !
Révérend, ce truc
va me travailler sans arrêt.
Je dois savoir si cet enfant
est mon petit-enfant,
mon sang.
Pourquoi tu parles
toujours à Cloutier ?
Faut que je sache si Bennett
dit la vérité sur Carrie.
- Et si le nègre ment ?
- Il est mort.
Je le planterai moi-même
entre les deux yeux.
James Robson a payé
Leroy Tidd pour me tuer,
mais Leroy s'est
converti à l'islam,
il est devenu Salah Yudin.
Robson a payé Carl Jenkins
pour finir le boulot.
Il est mort pour me sauver.
Et Jenkins est en procès
pour meurtre.
Mais pas Robson.
Une seule personne peut
corroborer votre théorie,
et c'est Jenkins. Il ne vendra pas
un copain nazi.
Je sais comment faire
tourner Jenkins.
Laissez-moi lui parler.
Non. Si tu affrontes Jenkins,
on enclenchera
une autre guerre raciale.
Glynn, contentez-vous
de faire ce que vous faites,
c'est à dire rien.
On peut parler seul ?
Quel est votre problème ?
Je vous ai observé.
Je crois que vous êtes
un homme de Dieu,
fidèle à votre croyance.
Que vous croyez en la justice.
C'est vrai.
J'ai une faveur
à vous demander.
Vous êtes venu pour me tuer ?
Non.
Pour t'aider.
Pour sauver ton âme.
Jenkins t'a vendu.
Il a mis le meurtre
de Leroy Tidd sur ton dos.
Vous l'avez battu pour
qu'il se confesse ?
C'est fini.
- C'est sa parole contre la mienne.
- Vous allez griller.
C'est sa putain de parole
contre la mienne !
Merci, Vern.
Carl.
C'est pour toi.
De tes amis de la Fraternité.
SUCEUR DE NEGRES
Il y a un problème ?
Vous avez été un réconfort
pour moi, Révérend.
Aussi, je vais
vous laisser vivre.
Mais ne vous mêlez plus jamais
des affaires de la Fraternité.
- Vern...
- "Je verserai sur toi
mon indignation.
Je soufflerai contre toi
le feu de mon courroux
et je te livrerai en la main
d'hommes brutaux,
artisans de destruction".
Comment ça va, p'tite bite ?
- Enculé !
- Eh, eh !
Rentre là.
Voilà, Alvarez.
Connard.
Eh, Smith.
- Ouais ?
- Jenkins a pas l'air bien.
Tu veux dire quoi ?
Je pense pas
qu'il va manger son poulet.
Oh, merde !
Of, merde !
Phelan !
Prenez votre téléphone
et appelez l'hygiène !
J'en ai marre de cohabiter
avec Mickey et autres rats.
Mickey est une souris.
Je suis sérieux, merde !
Ton tir est déréglé.
- Mon lancer a pas de problème.
- Si.
- Tu n'accompagnes pas le coup.
- Donnez-moi la balle.
Regarde. Tu vois ?
Là, j'accompagne.
Ça, c'est un accompagnement.
Ton tir en extension
était erratique avant Oz.
Erratique, mon cul. Vous avez vu
mon dernier match ?
J'en ai foutu 55 aux Bulls.
Si je me souviens bien,
ton équipe a perdu ce soir-là.
J'avais pas d'aide.
Je pense que t'étais
trop égoïste.
Vous venez tous voir les matchs
parce que vous savez pas jouer.
Moi aussi, j'ai joué.
J'avais pas tes dons,
mais mes équipes ont gagné.
La ligue des petits blancs de la ville ?
Pas vraiment la NBA.
Eh, gagner c'est gagner.
On sait comment gagner
ou on ne sait pas.
C'est en soi.
Vous dîtes que si on jouait,
vous me battriez ?
Dans les bonnes circonstances,
la balle bondit
dans le bon sens, qui sait ?
Dans aucune circonstance
vous me battrez.
Je vous aurais de neuf
sur une partie de 10,
je vous battrais 10-9
à chaque fois.
Je pourrais prendre le plus
mauvais enculé de cette prison
et vous le meilleur,
et je défoncerais votre vieux cul
de presque 50 piges.
OK, on y va.
- Quoi ?
- Prends le pire détenu,
je prendrai le meilleur gardien.
On se fait une petite partie.
Vous êtes sérieux.
- Plutôt, oui.
- Vous serez furax si je dis non.
- Je dis non.
- Ouais ? Va te faire foutre.
Quand on y pense, c'est vous
qui allez vous faire foutre.
Si tu dis oui,
je te renvoie à Em City.
Un tournoi de basket ?
Plutôt une démonstration.
Au meilleur des trois manches.
- C'est reparti.
- Ça veut dire quoi ?
- Et si ça tourne mal ?
- Ça va pas mal tourner.
C'est ce que t'avais dit pour la boxe
et Hamid Khan est mort.
Le basket n'est pas de la boxe.
Je veux surtout
contrôler la foule.
Le gymnase ne pourra pas contenir
le même nombre de prisonniers.
On limite le nombre.
Le comportement
est le prix d'admission.
OK.
C'est tout.
J'ai besoin d'un équipier.
Me regardez pas comme ça.
Oh, allez, Leo.
Vous adorez le basket.
En effet, mais je ne veux pas
me frotter à Jackson Vahue.
- Leo, ensemble, on pourrait...
- Non, Tim.
Trouvez un autre gars.
Je reste sur la touche.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Je voudrais que tu joues
avec moi contre Vahue.
Merci, je ne crois pas, non.
Eh, t'es mon gars.
J'ai besoin de toi.
Tim, écoute, je...
Je pense que tu devrais
laisser tomber.
- Quoi ?
- C'est mauvais pour nous.
Il n'y pas que toi dans l'histoire.
Nous autres gardiens, on va en prendre
plein la gueule quand tu vas perdre.
Qui sait ?
On pourrait gagner.
Tu vas pas gagner.
Tu vas te faire botter le cul !
Si je peux trouver l'espace
et ajuster mon tir,
je peux marquer.
Et t'étais hyper bon au lycée.
C'était il y a 20 ans,
et tu sors de l'hôpital !
- Je ne joue pas.
- Oh, d'accord !
- Va te faire voir !
- Merde, Tim.
Tu sais, tu peux être
un vrai con parfois.
Alors ? Timmy trouve personne
pour jouer à la baballe ?
Dave !
Eh, on dirait que tu sais jouer.
T'es bon.
Ah ouais ?
OK. T'es même meilleur que ça.
- T'as joué à la fac ?
- Ouais.
Deux bonnes années
dans une école, au nord.
T'as pas fait un programme
de quatre ans ?
Si. Université de l'Iowa.
Mais j'ai dû laisser tomber.
Mauvaises notes ?
Je séchais la compétition
pour des matchs de foot.
Toutes les conneries
auxquelles je pouvais penser.
On ne m'a jamais
accusé de rien.
Ouais, mais l'école a dû
se débarrasser de toi, hein ?
Ouais. Je présume
qu'au fond de moi
je savais que j'aurais pas duré.
Écoute...
j'ai lancé un défi à Jackson Vahue,
deux contre deux.
- Je sais.
- Tu veux être mon partenaire ?
- Pour affronter Vahue ?
- Ouais.
Ce serait un rêve.
Vous vouliez me voir ?
- Busmalis, entre.
- Je m'assois ?
- Non. Tu joues au basket ?
- Non.
- Et quand t'étais plus jeune ?
- Non.
- Un sport quelconque ?
- Non.
Je tenais les serviettes.
Présente-toi à Jackson Vahue.
T'es son nouvel équipier.
Comme vous le savez,
c'est au meilleur de trois parties,
et puisque notre terrain est plus petit
que la taille réglementaire,
on jouera en court complet.
On comptera 20 minutes.
Chaque équipe aura
un arrêt de jeu,
et la ligne
des trois points compte.
OK, on y va.
Dans le vent ! Dans le vent !
Vahue ! Vahue ! Vahue !
La cour a établi jeudi prochain
comme date de votre exécution.
Vous avez décidé
comment vous voulez mourir ?
Je suis pas comme
mon pote Giles là-bas.
Je veux pas de grands effets,
comme la lapidation.
L'injection me conviendra,
monsieur.
- Bien.
- J'ai contacté
l'association
de donneur d'organes
pour donner tes organes
aux gens dans le besoin.
Ils étaient enthousiasmés
par ta générosité.
Ils le seront aussi
à mon dernier souffle.
L'association ne voulait pas
que tu rencontres
ceux à qui tu donnerais
des organes,
mais avec un peu de persuasion,
ils ont accepté.
Mais uniquement
si le patient est d'accord.
- C'est normal.
- Y'en a déjà un.
Demain matin,
tu rencontreras Jiffy Karas.
- C'est qui ?
- Un aveugle.
Tes cornées l'aideront
à retrouver la vue.
Ne vous levez pas.
Je m'appelle Jiffy Karas.
Ne me demandez pas pourquoi
mon père m'a appelé Jiffy.
- Moïse Deyell.
- Ah, mon héros.
On ne m'avait jamais
appelé comme ça.
Eh bien, c'est ce
que vous êtes.
Les enfants de mes enfants
chanteront vos louanges.
Vous avez été aveugle
toute votre vie ?
Non.
J'ai perdu la vue
il y a deux ans.
Mais grâce à vous,
je pourrai voir le visage
de mes enfants à nouveau.
Je suis content que ma mort
puisse apporter du bien.
M. Deyell,
puis-je vous toucher ?
- Me toucher ?
- Votre visage.
Je veux pouvoir
me souvenir de vous.
Ouais, bien sûr.
OK, Deyell. On vous livrera
au Benchley Memorial
pour que les docteurs
puissent faire les tests
dont ils ont besoin avant jeudi.
Tu rencontreras
aussi Deborah Beck,
une étudiante en sciences
sociales de 20 ans.
Elle recevra ton cœur.
Vous savez ce qui est dingue ?
Sur le point de mourir,
je me sens plus vivant que jamais,
comme si j'avais plus
de raisons de vivre.
- Emmenez-le.
- A plus tard, Said.
C'est marrant,
il a dit ça comme
s'il allait pas revenir.
Vous allez tout risquer
pour le million ?
Absolument.
Je me sens chanceux.
Quelle est la capitale
du Burkina Faso ?
Une idée ?
Burkina Faso City ?
J'ai besoin d'un indice
ou d'une réponse.
C'est quoi la réponse,
Beecher ?
J'en n'ai pas
la moindre idée.
Je suis sorti avec une fille
qui s'appelait Burkina Faso.
Et la capitale de la Haute Volta
est Ouagagoudou.
- Vous êtes sûr ?
- Certain. Ouagagoudou.
Désolé, John. La réponse
est Ouagadougou.
- Ouagagoudou est faux.
- Vous plaisantez.
Nous interrompons ce programme
pour un bulletin spécial.
Nous venons d'apprendre
que le meurtrier condamné
Moïse Deyell est mort
dans une tentative d'évasion
en étant transféré
de la Prison d'Oswald vers
le Benchley Memorial Hospital.
Deyell, qui avait décidé
de donner ses organes
était transporté
dans un camion
quand il a sauté
du véhicule en marche.
Nous aurons plus
de détails bientôt.
Donc, Orphée
retourne sur Terre,
seul, triste, et alors ?
Est-ce que les villageois
le consolent ? Putain, non.
Ils lui reprochent son échec
et le déchirent en petits
morceaux, littéralement.
Ensuite, ils jettent
ses organes dans la rivière.
Tout ça parce
qu'il avait déçu sa famille,
parce qu'il avait regardé
une dernière fois celle qu'il aimait.
Les dieux n'ont pas un gramme
de sensibilité dans le corps.
Matricule 01C972,
Padraig Connolly,
arrêté le 28 février 2001.
Entrée illégale aux USA.
Détenu en attente
de son expulsion.
Padraig Connolly est ici ?
Il est arrivé ce matin.
Vous le connaissez ?
Grâce aux journaux.
Membre de l'IRA,
le gouvernement britannique
veut l'extrader
pour son implication
dans la mort d'un soldat anglais.
La cour vient de décider
en faveur de Connolly,
ils lui ont donné asile.
L'Immigration a fait appel
de la décision.
On nous a envoyé Connolly
en attendant la bataille légale.
- Il n'est pas dans une prison fédérale ?
- Il l'était.
Il recevait
des menaces de mort.
Il s'est presque fait tuer
par un sympathisant protestant,
alors nos amis
des Affaires Étrangères
ont demandé si on pouvait
le cacher à Oz.
- Mettez Connolly à Em City.
- Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Vous voulez étudier le moindre
de ses mouvements, hein ?
C'est un vrai terroriste.
Je dois dire que je suis intrigué.
OK, il est à vous.
Que Dieu vous aide.
Padraig, je m'appelle
Tim McManus.
Je suis m'occupe d'Em City.
Assieds-toi.
J'ai suivi ton dossier,
et je sais à quel point
c'est n'importe quoi.
J'ai pris la liberté
d'appeler ton avocat
et j'ai d'assez bonnes nouvelles.
Je ne pense pas que
tu vas être ici longtemps.
Puisque tu désires
rester aux US,
il y a peu de risques de fuite.
Ton avocat pense donc qu'avec
un juge solidaire à ta cause,
plus le support des groupes
de droits de l'homme,
on va te proposer une caution.
C'est une bonne nouvelle.
Je peux y aller ?
Euh, ouais.
Oui, bien sûr.
C'est qui ?
Padraig Connolly.
Tout ce dont on a besoin ici.
Un autre bouffeur de patates.
- Eh, j'suis Ryan O'Reily.
- Recule !
- Hein ?
- Dans l'entrée.
- Non, je suis juste venu...
- Recule.
OK, j'aime bien ça, Padraig.
T'es un soldat, t'es prudent.
C'est bien.
Comment tu connais mon nom ?
A la télé,
ces deux derniers jours,
y'en avait que pour toi
et l'IRA exécutant
ce connard de commandant
britannique.
C'était à la télé, l'exécution
du Capitaine Harley ?
C'est pas ce qui s'est passé.
On s'en fout.
C'est ce que les gars ici croient.
Et crois-moi,
c'est bien pour nous deux.
M. O'Reily, je n'ai pas besoin
de ce que vous vendez.
Tu sais, Padraig,
tu commences à m'énerver,
alors je ne le dirai qu'une fois.
Tu devrais traiter Oz
comme l'Irlande du Nord,
parce qu'ici tu marches,
parles, dors, travailles, manges,
chies et bois avec les tiens.
Tu me comprends ?
Parce que ton nom est O'Reily,
tu fais parti des miens ?
On a la même couleur verte
dans nos veines.
Si c'était vrai,
ça compterait pour toi ?
- De quoi ?
- Qu'il n'y a pas eu d'exécution.
Tu devrais me regarder.
- On nous observe.
- Observe ?
Je sors d'ici et sur
mon langage corporel
tout le monde saura
ce qu'il y a entre nous.
Je ne resterai pas assez pour
avoir besoin de ton amitié.
Je te souhaite
une bonne promenade.
Connolly ?
Je m'appelle Timmy Kirk.
C'est Jim Burns.
Qu'est-ce que
ça peut me faire ?
On t'invite
à une étude biblique
qu'organise le Révérend
Cloutier cet après-midi.
Cloutier ? Qui est Cloutier ?
Tu te convertis
aujourd'hui, Padraig.
Soit ça,
ou on éjecte le catho qui dort
en toi à coups de poing.
A toi de voir.
Merde. Burns, Burns, stop.
C'est quoi le problème ?
Faut continuer un peu.
OK. Qui a commencé ?
On ne fait que boxer.
- Sans gants ?
- Il dit la vérité.
Un peu de boxe.
Je leur montrais les techniques
du grand John L. Sullivan.
OK, barrez-vous, vous deux.
Écoute, Padraig,
je peux te fournir
une protection rapprochée.
Ça a l'air contraignant.
Non, merci.
M. Zelman,
quel est le problème ?
Assieds-toi, mon gars.
L'audience pour la caution
n'a pas eu lieu ?
Elle a eu lieu et c'est fini.
Ceci est une lettre
du Ministère de la Justice
demandant à la cour
de te refuser une caution.
Putain de merde. Et ?
J'ai bien peur que
cet appel ne remonte
jusqu'à la Cour Suprême.
Tu pourrais être coincé à Oz
pendant un bon bout de temps.
Il t'a... il t'a battue ?
- Quoi ?
- Papa. Il t'a battue ?
- C'est pour ça que t'es partie ?
- Non.
Il t'a trompée.
J'avais tout juste 17 ans,
le monde était nouveau pour moi,
et il y avait des gens à voir
et des endroits à explorer.
Alors, tu l'as trompé ?
Je dirais.
D'une certaine manière.
Je le déteste. Tu sais ?
Je ne t'en voudrai jamais
d'avoir quitté ce connard,
mais ce que
je ne comprends pas...
c'est, je ne t'ai même pas...
Manqué ?
Depuis la nuit de ta conception
jusqu'au jour de mon départ,
tu as été mon unique bonheur.
Je ne le savais pas alors.
J'étais une enfant avec
un bébé de trois mois.
Je ne pensais pas
ne jamais te revoir.
Ça s'est juste passé
comme ça.
Non, tu...
tu dois penser à Cyril.
- Quoi ?
- Tu as dit trois mois.
C'était Cyril, le bébé.
Non, Ryan, tu étais le bébé.
Mais j'ai un an et demi
de plus que Cyril.
Ton père et moi n'avons
pas eu Cyril ensemble.
De quoi tu parles ?
Cyril est ton demi-frère.
Cyril, tu te souviens de...
de la fois où Papa
nous avait fait passer l'été
dans l'Indiana à la ferme
de l'Oncle Bill ?
Y'avait toi, moi et
ces trois gosses du quartier
dans les champs,
à planter des haricots.
Et Oncle Bill m'avait
désigné comme chef
et ces trois gosses
avaient décidé d'arrêter
parce qu'ils trouvaient
que je criais trop.
Je crois qu'ils voulaient
se baigner.
Et ils voulaient t'emmener,
mais à la place
tu avais décidé
de rester avec moi
dans les champs jusqu'à
ce qu'on ait fini.
Je me suis toujours demandé...
t'es resté parce
qu'on était frères
ou t'es resté
parce que tu croyais
que je te taperais dessus ?
Un, deux, trois, quatre. Monte.
Un, deux, trois.
Tout ce temps dans la cage,
j'ai pas pu m'entraîner.
Pas assez de place
pour bouger.
Eh, Jia, on essaie
de s'entraîner.
- Tu veux pas la fermer ?
- Je veux essayer ça.
- Non, stop.
- Je peux t'apprendre plein de trucs
meilleurs que
cette boxe de merde.
- Je veux apprendre.
- OK.
Essaie ça.
Eh, connard !
Non, recule ! Recule !
Il t'a frappé ! Il t'a frappé !
Recule ! Recule !
Oh, merde.
- Alors ?
- Jia est dans le coma.
On l'a envoyé
au Benchley Memorial,
mais je ne sais pas quand
ou s'il se réveillera.
Un autre KO
pour Cyril O'Reily.
- Jia a provoqué Cyril.
- C'est ce que dit son frère.
Mais Ryan O'Reily n'est ni
un homme de confiance, ni objectif.
- C'est à dire ?
- On a assez reculé cette décision.
On devrait envoyer Cyril
au Conley Institute.
- Ce serait une erreur tragique.
- Pour qui ?
Le frère de Cyril est son seul
lien avec la réalité.
Si on les sépare, il sombrera
dans la démence.
Si on le garde,
il se battra encore,
et mettra quelqu'un d'autre
dans le coma.
On devrait le transférer
aujourd'hui.
- Vous êtes cruel.
- Mais pas aveugle.
J'ai une alternative.
Plaçons Cyril en protection
rapprochée un moment,
autorisons Ryan
à des visites régulières
et voyons comment
Cyril s'adapte.
- Ça marche pour moi.
- Tim ?
OK.
Tant qu'il n'est plus
dans mes pattes.
Mais je ne veux pas partir.
Cyril, fais-moi confiance.
Il le faut.
Sinon, ils vont t'envoyer
très loin de moi,
et on ne se verra plus.
Allez.
Ça va aller. Prends ton sac.
Allez, viens. On y va.
Cyril. Sois fort, OK ?
- Eh, O'Reily.
- Ouais ?
T'as éliminé Jia.
Je te redevrai ça.
T'as un problème, l'ami ?
J'ai une confession à faire.
Il y a plusieurs mois,
j'allais au gymnase...
Il n'y avait personne
sauf Ryan O'Reily
et Patrick Keenan.
J'étais tellement pris
par mes échecs,
que j'ai mis l'accident de côté,
mais chaque jour, quand
je suis à côté d'O'Reily,
- je me dis : "fais quelque chose".
- Comme quoi ?
Le dire aux autorités.
L'agression de Jia Kenmin
ne fait que prouver
qu'O'Reily va continuer
à blesser des gens.
OK.
On ira voir le directeur
Glynn ensemble.
Parce que si O'Reily
apprend que tu l'as dit...
il te tuera.
Je ne sais pas
de quoi vous parlez.
Patrick Keenan était mon ami.
Celui qui vous a raconté
cette merde en a après moi.
L'informateur n'a pas
de raison de mentir.
Écoutez, quand tous
ces journalistes sont venus,
ils m'ont posé des questions
sur les vidéos d'Adebisi
et j'ai rien dit.
Quoi ? Vous espérez
un retour de faveur ?
- Oui.
- Allez vous faire foutre !
Je vais enquêter
sur cette accusation.
Si je trouve des preuves,
vous finirez dans le couloir de la mort.
Compris ?
- Quel est le problème ?
- Il s'est évanoui.
- Ryan, ça va ?
- Ouais.
Il fallait que je vous parle,
j'ai fait semblant de tomber.
- Vous m'avez fait flipper.
- Désolé.
Quel est le problème ?
En privé.
Vous réalisez que c'est la première fois
qu'on est que tous les deux ?
Il faut que j'y retourne, Ryan,
alors dîtes-moi
ce qui est si important.
Ça devient
une vraie merdre, Gloria.
Il y a de bonnes chances
que Cyril finisse chez les fêlés,
et que je sois condamné
pour le meurtre de Keenan.
Quoi ? Comment ?
Quelqu'un a bavé au directeur.
Oh, c'était pas vous, hein ?
- Non.
- Non, ces yeux ne mentent pas.
Continuez.
J'ai entendu
qu'il y a une bonne chance
que vous perdiez votre licence,
ce qui veut dire
que je ne vous reverrai jamais.
Je sais.
J'ai une proposition
à vous faire.
Ne me répondez pas
tout de suite.
Je veux que vous preniez
le temps de réfléchir
à ce que je vais vous demander.
C'est à dire ?
Je veux que vous nous aidiez,
Cyril et moi, à nous échapper.
Les mythes sont censé
nous apprendre quelque chose.
Mais quelle est la leçon
de l'histoire d'Orphée ?
Une bonne action
ne reste pas impunie ?
De la merde.
Une bonne action,
ça n'existe pas.
L'amour peut tout vaincre ?
Pas plus.
La morale est peut-être
que ceux qui ont le pouvoir
sont aussi détraqués
que ceux qui n'en ont pas,
et la pire chose qu'on puisse faire,
c'est abandonner son pouvoir
à des idiots sur le Mont Olympe,
parce que s'ils sont si puissants,
pourquoi nous laissent-ils
faire toutes ces conneries ?
Va savoir.
Ah, la compétition fait ressortir
ce qu'il y a de mieux chez les gens.
C'est ce qu'on dit.
Quand le match est
à un point décisif, un vrai sportif
veut que le résultat repose
sur ses épaules.
La logique étant :
vous marquez le but gagnant,
vous partez en héros.
Bien sûr, si vous vous plantez,
vous êtes l'imbécile.
Le problème avec
la compétition, ici à Oz
c'est qu'on a surtout
des imbéciles.
Nous accueillons une nouvelle
candidate, Joanie Kennedy.
Et pour vous aider,
un homme
qui a pratiquement tout fait,
Bill Boggs.
- Ça va, Bill ?
- Ravi de vous voir, Gordon.
Ok, au jeu maintenant. Dans la
catégorie sports, la question est :
En basket, Joanie, qu'est-ce que ça
signifie quand l'arbitre fait ce geste ?
Il veut faire la macarena ?
Désolé, je ne
regarde pas le basket.
Je m'intéresse plutôt
à la pêche en haute mer.
Ok, alors
un peut d'aide, Bill.
Quand l'arbitre fait ça,
ça s'appelle aussi "marcher".
Comment ça va, Omar ?
- Très bien.
- Vraiment ?
J'ai encore toutes
sortes de douleurs
depuis que
tu m'as poignardé.
Tu sais, j'en suis désolé.
- Oh, tu es désolé ?
- Ouais.
Je suis désolé que
tu ne sois pas mort.
Non, non, non.
Prisonnier numéro 96G522,
Carmen Guerra,
alias "Chico".
Condamné le 4 juin 1996
pour assassinat.
Sentence : 53 ans,
dont 17 fermes.
- McManus, faut que je vous parle.
- Plus tard.
C'est à propos de votre
projet favori, Omar White.
- Quoi ?
- Il touche toujours à la came.
Et tu te sens obligé de me le dire
pour pouvoir sauver son âme ?
Écoutez, il vous a planté,
et moi aussi,
et il finira par planter
quelqu'un d'autre.
Si vous le fouillez,
vous trouverez de la drogue.
Fouille !
Eh !
- Regarde, regarde.
- Regarde ma merde.
Double jeu.
- Putain de rat jaune, enculé de punk !
- Va te faire enculer.
- Salaud !
- Mettez M. Guerra dans la cage.
- Emmenez M. White en haut.
- Putain de rat jaune, salaud de punk !
Lavette !
On avait un accord.
- Pas de drogue.
- Je sais.
Alors dis-moi pourquoi je devrais pas
te renvoyer en isolement par FedEx.
Il n'y a pas de raison.
C'est que quand il s'agit...
quand il s'agit de la came,
j'suis un peu faible.
Dieu sait que j'essaie.
J'essaie.
Mais la tentation...
elle devient de plus
en plus grande
jusqu'à ce que je puisse pas
m'en empêcher. Je...
J'envoie cette merde
où elle n'a rien à faire.
Tu me prends vraiment
pour une andouille ?
Monsieur ?
Tu fais cette tête désolée,
tu me dis ce je dois vouloir entendre.
Que des conneries, Omar !
Et ma patience a des limites.
Sœur Pete dit que tu ne vas pas
en thérapie régulièrement.
Il y a une séance
à 1 3h00 aujourd'hui.
T'as intérêt à y être.
Allez.
La solution...
c'est d'occuper le temps
passé à vous droguer
en faisant autre chose.
Comme mettre la raclée
à McManus au basket. Ok.
Les activités, c'est bien, mais
ça ne change pas
quelque chose de primordial.
Vous n'arrêterez pas
si vous ne le voulez pas.
Il faut toucher le fond
avant de pouvoir remonter.
Pourquoi tu me regardes
quand tu dis ça ?
Je le disais pas à toi.
Je le disais au groupe.
Quoi ? Tu... tu penses
que t'es mieux que moi
- parce que... t'as arrêté et moi pas ?
- Omar.
T'es pas mieux que moi,
putain de cul de punk de blanc !
Au lieu de sniffer,
tu suces des bites !
- Ça suffit, Omar !
- Tu veux sucer ça, enculé ?
Eh, eh, eh, eh !
- T'as rien !
- Tu crois que je plaisante ?
Tu joues mal, Vahue.
Quoi, tu vas encore
venir me griffer ?
Je t'ai eu.
Je t'ai eu, Chapman.
- Espèce de merde
- Poet est le plus grand !
Prends soin de toi.
En général,
je ne laisse tomber personne,
mais ce type, Omar,
pourrait être une exception.
White !
je sais. J'ai encore merdé.
Toutes conneries à part,
je veux... je veux
posséder mon propre esprit.
Écoute,
Je sais pas pourquoi je pense
que je peux t'aider
mais je vais pas
te laisser tomber, Omar.
Tu comprends ?
Je ne vais pas capituler.
Merci.
Putain de salaud !
J'espère que vous allez crever ici,
enculé de salaud !
J'espère que tu vous allez
pourrir en enfer !
Vous avez tué mon bébé !
Le conseil d'évaluation
a fixé l'entretien à mercredi prochain.
D'après Hoyle,
si tout va bien,
Tobias, vous pourriez être
sorti d'Oz d'ici la fin du mois.
Les parents de Cathy Rockwell
ont été avisés de l'entretien ?
Probablement pas. Dans la plupart
des cas, c'est la responsabilité
de la victime ou de la famille
de la victime de s'informer.
Je veux le leur dire.
C'est pas conseillé. S'ils demandent
à témoigner, les parents de Cathy
pourraient dissuader le conseil
de vous laisser sortir.
Avant l'assassinat de mon fils,
je n'ai jamais
compris ce que j'avais
fait à ces gens.
Je pourrai pas me réintégrer dans
le monde si je sors en cachette.
Mon temps de prison regarde
les Rockwells autant que quiconque.
Ils ont le droit d'être entendus.
Ok, je vais les appeler.
Mais avant l'entretien
avec le conseil,
je vais leur demander d'avoir
une interaction avec vous.
Catherine.
J'espère que vous comprenez
pourquoi je fais ça.
En tant qu'avocat,
je pense que vous êtes fou.
Mais en tant que mère...
Je crois que vous en avez
dans les trippes.
La dernière fois où nous
nous sommes vus, Mme Rockwell,
je n'ai pas dit grand chose.
- Vous n'avez rien dit.
- Ouais.
C'est parce que j'étais drogué
et j'étais confus,
plein de dégoût
pour moi-même.
Et maintenant
vous vous êtes pardonné ?
Non.
Ce que j'ai fait à votre fille
me suivra pour toujours,
tout comme le fait
d'avoir été à Oz.
Ce qui m'est arrivé ici...
Que j'aie souffert assez ou non
pour vous satisfaire,
je ne sais pas.
Quand vous avez été
condamné à 15 ans,
j'étais abasourdi.
15 misérables années n'égalent pas
toute une vie que ma fille a perdu.
Vous dites que
vous avez souffert,
et je dis tant mieux.
Quand mon avocat est venue parler
de ma liberté conditionnelle,
elle a dit qu'à cause
de circonstances atténuantes,
le conseil pourrait
me regarder gentiment.
Vous voulez expliquer
ces circonstances ?
Depuis que je suis enfermé,
mon fils a été assassiné
et peut-être
mon épouse aussi,
tous deux à cause de choses
que j'ai faites ici.
Ce qui est ironique,
c'est que je suis venu à Oz
en passant par la tombe
de votre fille
et je pourrais en partir
passant par
les tombes
de ma propre famille.
S'ils avaient vécu, je n'aurais eu
aucune chance d'être mis en liberté.
Quand je vous ai vu,
il y a quatre ans,
la douleur de la mort de Cathy
était encore très récente.
Dave et moi...
avons eu du chagrin
à n'en plus finir.
Nous en avons toujours.
Mais la tristesse est
contrebalancée par de la joie.
Nous avons un autre enfant,
Richard, et il grandit remarquablement.
Nous croyons que bien que
nous ne comprenons pas
pourquoi Cathy nous a quittés
nous acceptons sa mort,
en tant qu'une partie de...
d'un plan qui nous dépasse.
Je ne sais pas
si vous avez assez souffert.
C'est pas à moi
d'en décider.
Seul Dieu le peut.
Nous ne nous opposerons pas
à votre liberté conditionnelle.
Vince Lombardi dit un jour
que gagner n'est pas tout,
c'est la seule chose.
Mais ce que Lombardi tenait
en plus haute considération
que gagner,
c'était le caractère.
En fait, sans caractère,
il n'y a pas de victoire.
Ne vous méprenez pas.
Certains de ses joueurs rataient
le couvre-feu, draguaient, baisaient,
mais ils savaient
où était la limite.
C'est vrai.
Un homme bon
sait où est la limite.
Bobson, tu es vraiment
un enculé moche.
J'te vois pas modèle
à Milan, espèce de pute noire.
Eh, ferme ta putain de gueule,
j'essaie de me masturber.
- Va te faire foutre, Alvarez !
- Silence !
- Directeur sur le pont.
- Salut.
Glynn. J'ai besoin
d'un rendez-vous, enculé.
Eh, Glynn,
vous m'excitez.
Vous voulez tenir ma bite ?
Faut qu'on parle seuls.
- Vous l'avez fouillé ?
- Oui, monsieur.
Ok.
Vous me croyez dangereux ?
Je n'ai plus aucune idée
de quoi tu es capable.
Je suis très surpris.
Vous voilà, un homme que tous
les prisonniers d'Oz craignent,
- et vous avez peur de moi. Ouah.
- Que veux-tu ?
J'ai décidé d'avouer
le meurtre de John Basil,
et je vais demander
la peine de mort.
Pour pouvoir
mourir en martyr.
J'ai écrit un manifeste
que je veux publié
le jour de mon exécution.
Où as-tu eu le papier ?
Agent Smith !
Ce prisonnier n'est autorisé à avoir
du papier sous aucune circonstance.
- Leo !
- Tu veux te détruire. Ok.
Mais je ne vais pas t'aider.
Bon sang d'enculé !
Oh, partez pas,
oncle Tom.
Partez pas.
Me laissez pas, baby.
- Me laissez pas comme ça !
- Directeur !
Carl Jenkins est mort.
Vous n'avez rien contre moi.
Je veux sortir d'ici, Glynn.
J'veux sortir d'ici, Glynn !
J'veux sortir !
J'veux un d'avocat !
Amenez-moi ce putain de Said !
Espèce d'enculé !
Sortez-moi de là !
Je ne veux pas sortir
Robson d'isolement
plus que vous,
mais j'ai pas le choix.
Carl Jenkins s'est suicidé.
Un bon avocat de la défense
peut descendre son témoignage.
Et sans témoignage
on a rien contre Robson.
Alors vous allez le remettre
avec la population générale
bien qu'il ait orchestré
la mort de Salah Yudin
et qu'il ait juré
de me tuer aussi ?
Malheureusement. Comme on
ne peut pas prouver sa culpabilité,
le garder en isolement
cellulaire serait injuste.
Comment se fait-il
que la justice
ne marche qu'en faveur
de quelqu'un d'autre ?
Arif, aide-moi.
J'ai tellement
de rage en moi.
Une rage comme
je n'en ai jamais connu.
Tu as toujours été capable
de contrôler de telles émotions.
Je ne pense pas pouvoir
le faire encore longtemps.
- J'ai l'impression d'être possédé.
- Prie Allah.
Prier ?
Je prie et je prie et rien.
Eh, désolé pour ce qui est arrivé
à Leroy Tidd,
ou Ooga Booga ou quelque soit
son putain de nom.
- Putain de nègre !
- Tu veux voir le nègre que j'ai en moi ?
Tu veux le voir ?
Putain de bamboula.
Enculé.
Putain de suceur...
enculé.
- Putain de nègre !
- Les Aryens doivent être punis.
Nous ne tolèrerons plus
leurs actes.
A partir de maintenant,
pas de quartiers.
Said a son cul de nègre
au trou.
- Arif a l'air de diriger.
- Bon.
Ces enculés sont plus
furieux que jamais.
Protégez-vous
les uns les autres,
- armez-vous si vous pouvez.
- Vengeance.
Ça va chier très bientôt.
Qu'est-ce que vous
me voulez putain ?
Le père Mukada
m'a prêté son bureau.
Le directeur veut
que je vous parle.
Il a peur que
les hostilités escaladent
entre vos gens
et les musulmans.
Asseyez-vous,
s'il vous plait.
Les gardes-chiourme ont raison
d'avoir peur.
Et vous aussi.
Vous pensez que
je vous ai fait du mal
en poussant Carl Jenkins
à témoigner contre Robson,
mais je vous assure que j'ai fait
ce que j'ai fait au nom de la justice.
Vous l'avez fait parce que
Robson était en pétard
quand vous avez essayé
de me changer en cul béni.
Je n'ai jamais imaginé
que vous vous convertiriez.
Je voulais simplement que vous ayez
un peu de joie dans votre vie,
la naissance
de votre petit enfant.
Ouais, si c'est
ma petit fille.
Vous avez parlé à cette femme
de votre congrégation ?
Sarah ? Oui.
Elle et Carrie ont eu
plusieurs conversations,
et Carrie n'a jamais parlé
d'avoir été une prostituée.
Sarah lui a posé
la question ?
Non.
Alors vous n'avez
rien prouvé du tout.
Quand allez vous
revoir cette fille ?
Dans une heure.
A moins que le directeur
ne boucle toute la prison.
Si je pouvais lui assurer
qu'au moins pour l'instant
il n'y aura aucun tumulte,
peut-être que le directeur Glynn
va revenir sur sa décision.
Marché conclu.
Bonjour, M. Schillinger.
Qu'est-ce qui vous est
arrivé au visage ?
Oh rien. C'est rien.
Voilà, toute sèche.
Eh, t'es prête à jouer
avec grand-père ?
- C'est bon.
- Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Je vais te poser
des questions importantes,
et je veux que tu dises
la vérité.
- OK.
- Pose la petite.
C'est rien.
C'est rien, Jewel.
- Oh, ma chérie.
- J'ai appris
que tu as fais le trottoir,
à te prostituer.
Je vois que c'est vrai.
- Hank a dit qu'il nous fallait du fric.
- J'veux pas le savoir.
Ce qui m'importe
c'est à qui est cet enfant ?
Elle n'est pas à Hank, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu le savais quand tu t'es pointée ici.
Je vous jure, quand j'ai appris
que j'étais enceinte,
j'ai compté en arrière pour essayer
de voir qui était le père.
Le jour où le bébé
a été conçu,
j'ai couché avec
trois hommes différents, Ok ?
Deux représentants
de passage et Hank.
Alors à vrai dire je ne sais pas
lequel est le père.
Je n'en suis pas sûre...
sauf que...
Regardez son visage.
Elle ressemble pas à Hank ?
Hein ?
Ça va.
Ok, Cloutier à fait promettre à
Schillinger de ne pas se venger,
alors il va garder Robson
sous contrôle.
Dis-moi que les musulmans
vont coopérer.
- Non.
- Quoi non ? Tu veux pas coopérer ?
Non, je ne peux
vous assurer de rien,
surtout pas du comportement
de mes gens
ou du mien.
Parce que vous voyez,
ce qui s'est passé s'est passé,
et va se passer longtemps
après notre mort à tous.
- C'est maintenant qui m'importe.
- C'est pas surprenant,
vous avez toujours vu
les choses de façon simpliste.
Tu as peut-être besoin
de deux jours de plus là-dedans.
- Ouais, peut-être !
- Comme tu veux.
Allez-y, sortez !
Si les athlètes apprenaient à contrôler
leur tempérament, leur furie,
les joueurs de hockey ne seraient
jamais sur la surface de réparation,
les basketteurs ne feraient pas
de fautes techniques
les footballeurs ne seraient pas
pénalisés de 15 mètres.
Bien sûr, si les athlètes
contrôlaient leur rage,
personne ne s'intéresserait
aux sports.
Donner des coups, étrangler, donner
des coups de pieds, mordre, hurler !
C'est ce que les fans vont voir.
Oh, merde.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Il est 7h00. Le match
c'est cet après-midi.
Ouais. je voulais
travailler mon tir.
Je suis toujours tourmenté par
mes mauvais tirs du dernier match.
Ne te casse pas la tête.
J'ai pas fait beaucoup mieux.
Ouais.
Qu'est-ce que tu penses
de Vahue ?
Sacré putain de joueur.
Un joueur fort,
dur et plein de talent.
C'est drôle.
C'est ce que j'ai dit sur toi.
Peut être pas
mot pour mot.
Un ami à moi est recruteur
pour les Sacramento Kings.
Je lui ai parlé de toi.
Il dit qu'il veut jeter un œil.
- Jeter un œil ?
- Ouais, aujourd'hui.
Eh, t'as tout de suite commencé
par deux paniers,
j'étais là, "Oh merde,
ça va être fini vite fait".
Eh, du rabe.
- Et... réserve spéciale.
- Oh, merde.
Cool.
Eh, ce mec, Brass,
- C'est un putain de talent, hein ?
- Ouais.
- Oh on s'en fout.
- Cet enculé sait jouer.
- Mais j'suis trop grand pour lui.
- Ouais.
Le deuxième match
va être comme le premier.
Ça va être serré...
tant que je le voudrai.
- T'entends ça ?
- Ouais, c'est vrai.
Vahue est large.
Y'a pas moyen de le bloquer.
Impossible que McManus
et Brass gagnent.
Eh, Vahue.
Retourne chercher
ton plateau.
- Oh, c'est bon.
- Oh, non, non, non.
Il remporte
son propre plateau.
De la merde.
- Oh, merde !
- Recule putain !
Reculez putain !
Reculez putain !
- Ça va pas non ? allez.
- Bon sang ! Tu m'as pété le genou.
- Alors, dites quelque chose.
- Vahue a provoqué la situation.
On a respecté les règles.
Bien, dites-moi
si c'est trop serré.
- C'est mon L. C. A ?
- Non, il va bien.
C'est votre genou qui est très enflé.
Évitez de marcher quelques jours.
On va repousser
le match d'une semaine.
- Oh, vous vous inquiétez pour moi ?
- Non.
- Je veux que tu sois au top.
- Vous pensez toujours gagner ?
Si la balle rebondit
dans le bon sens, qui sait.
J'ai rien de cassé ?
Rien que je puisse voir.
Alors on se voit
au gymnase.
Dites à votre pote
d'être au top aussi.
Conneries ! Conneries ! Conneries !
J'aime ça.
Eh, Vahue.
Va te faire foutre.
Putain, tu nous as
laissés tomber, Vahue.
J'avais parié beaucoup d'argent
sur ce match, enculé.
Tug, laisse-moi
prendre la chaise.
Non, je m'en sers.
Non, vraiment.
Faut que je m'assoie
et que j'élève
cette jambe. Allez.
- J'me tire, mec.
- J'te suis.
Eh, Poet.
Eh, au dîner,
et si je prenais encore
de cette Gatorade ?
Je sais pas.
Je sais pas.
J'suis déshydraté. J'ai beaucoup
transpiré aujourd'hui.
J'vais voir ce que j'peux faire,
mais c'est pas gagné.
Écoutez, c'est simple.
Dans trois semaines
vous venez nous voir.
- Oh, bon Dieu.
- C'est sans garanties,
- mais vous pourriez être sélectionné.
- Félicitations.
Faut que j'y aille. Quelqu'un
du bureau va vous contacter.
Dernière chose. J'veux pas vous dire
de pas faire des matchs impromptus,
vous vous êtes engagés,
mais utilisez votre tête. Ok ?
Bien. Restez fort.
- J'vais quand même jouer.
- J'peux pas te demander ça.
- je sais combien tu veux gagner.
- J'vais trouver quelqu'un.
- Tim...
- J'vais trouver quelqu'un.
Putain.
Le voilà, l'homme
le plus chanceux de la planète.
- Chanceux ?
- Rectificatif : ancien chanceux.
Tout le monde le sait.
Ce recruteur aujourd'hui,
il est venu enlever votre mec.
Il est en route
pour les Kings.
Et sans Brass, vous allez avoir l'air
vachement andouille.
J'parie que vous perdriez
par... 50, 60 points.
Qui dit qu'il va
pas jouer avec moi ?
Je croyais que Dave Brass
ne jouait pas ?
- C'est vrai.
- Alors c'était quoi ça ?
J'voulais pas lui donner
cette satisfaction.
Il l'aura bien assez tôt.
- Eh, Martinez. Eh.
- Hola, mi hermano.
- Eh t'es toujours au quartier B ?
- Ouais.
- Super. J'ai besoin de quelque chose.
- Demande.
Doucement, doucement, !
Reste par terre ! Bien, bien ! Doucement,
doucement ! Bon Dieu !
- Où est Brass ?
- L'ambulance vient de partir.
- Faut une opération.
- Oh, putain ! C'est grave ?
Généralement parlant,
tout ira bien.
- Mais ?
- Mais il ne fera plus de basket.
Son tendon d'Achille
n'était pas juste coupé.
Il en manquait
un morceau.
Il va marcher bizarrement
le reste de sa vie.
Qu'est ce que tu veux ?
Ça fait comment ?
Comment quoi ?
D'être celui qui a cafté
aux gardes-chiourme,
qui nous ont empêchés
de buter Morales,
Pancamo et les autres,
qui nous ont empêchés
de reprendre avec la drogue ?
Non, non, non.
Viens là, viens là.
Écoute...
Burr Redding dit
que tu peux vivre
parce que toi et lui
avez un passé.
Mais il sera pas
toujours là.
Et quand il meurt...
tu meurs.
- Laisse-le partir.
- Tu veux quelque chose ?
- Quoi de neuf, sale nègre ?
- Bien que j'aimerais vous regarder
vous casser la gueule, soyez malins
et cassez-vous.
- Ouais. A plus tard.
- Tu le sais.
C'est tout ce que j'ai à dire,
Augustus.
T'as pas d'autres amis
que moi.
Le plan marche ?
Ouais.
Morales et Pancamo
me prennent pour leur esclave.
Burr Redding pense que je suis
son soldat le plus loyal.
Quand on aura fini,
ils seront tous morts,
et on dirigera à notre façon.
Je dois avouer, Tug,
j'ai été un peu surpris
quand tu m'as approché,
étant celui
qui a buté ton frère.
Quand je t'ai planté
et que t'es pas mort,
j'ai su que
t'avais des couilles.
Faut pas être un génie
pour comprendre
que Tug Daniels est un traître.
J'ai toujours eu
des doutes.
Qu'est-ce que
tu vas faire ?
Je crois que tout homme
a droit à un procès juste...
avant d'être exécuté.
Ce tribunal est maintenant
en séance.
- Va te faire enculer !
- Tug Daniels...
vous êtes accusé
de trois adjectifs :
déloyal, déshonnête,
- irrespectueux.
- Comment plaidez-vous ?
Si vous allez me zigouiller,
faites le donc, putain.
Arrêtez vos conneries, Ok ?
On t'a vu fraterniser
avec Supreme Allah.
J'ai seulement laissé croire à
cet andouille que j'étais de son côté.
Dès que je t'aurais tué,
lui et Hill étaient foutus.
L'accusation n'a
rien à ajouter.
- Quelque chose pour ta défense ?
- Ouais.
Tu me tues pour
le même crime que Hill
et tu lui as rien fait.
Tu vieillis, Burr.
Tu te ramollis.
- T'es plus à la hauteur.
- Silence.
Avec moi à la tête, vous dirigeriez Oz,
bande d'enculés.
Fais attention à
ce que je vais te dire.
Ce tribunal a décidé
que vous aviez été
déclaré coupable.
- Tuez cette vieille lavette, pas moi !
- Donc...
je dois rendre une sentence...
... de mort.
Balancez-le là-bas
derrière la cantine.
Collez-le dans
la benne à ordure.
Bougez-vous !
Oh la vache !
Oh, merde.
Eh, agent Robinson.
Vous feriez bien
de venir voir. Aïe.
Centrale, ici 16. Nous avons
un 44 dans la cantine.
On boucle ! On boucle !
Tug Daniels est mort.
Bougez-vous. Bougez-vous !
Nos jours sont comptés.
Toi et moi, si on
fait pas gaffe
on va finir comme
Tug Daniels.
Allez. Allez.
De plus en plus souvent,
vous achetez le journal
et le nom d'un athlète
fait la une.
Pas dans la page
des sports,
mais pour avoir
des ennuis avec la loi.
Ça ne me
surprend jamais.
L'adrénaline liée à l'état
de superstar
c'est pareil que le coup de fouet
ressenti en commettant un crime.
Le match terminé,
c'est difficile de se calmer,
difficile de redevenir ordinaire.
Ras le bol d'entendre parler du putain
de couloir de la mort.
- Gouverneur.
- Je vois que vous êtes bien remis.
Et je vois combien
ça vous réjouit.
Bien, parlons affaires.
J'ai parlé longuement
avec le procureur général,
et la situation
est la suivante.
D'après la loi,
Giles a le droit de demander
à être lapidé à mort.
Le putain de groupe anti-peine de mort
qui a porté plainte
va probablement gagner.
On va faire appel.
L'affaire va finir par atterrir
à la cour suprême d'état,
ou Dieu sait ce que ces vieilles
citrouilles vont décider.
Vous en avez nommé la moitié.
Merci de
me le rappeler. Alors...
au lieu de remuer
toute cette merde,
nous avons décidé que c'est plus
simple si vous, Sœur Peter Marie,
déclarez Giles
mentalement incompétent.
- Quoi ?
- Je commuerai sa peine à perpétuité
et on l'enverra
à l'Institut Conley
où il pourra bafouiller
jusqu'à sa mort.
Entre-temps, je demanderai
à la législature de réécrire
la loi sur la peine capitale,
limitant les options
des prisonniers
à injection mortelle
et électrocution.
Je ne le ferai pas.
Je ne dirai pas
que William Giles est fou.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce qu'il ne l'est pas.
Leo...
ce serait le moment
de vous en mêler.
Peter Marie, cette solution ferait
disparaître le problème.
Le problème disparaîtra
quand la peine de mort
disparaîtra.
Avec l'ADN,
toutes les deux semaines...
il y a une autre histoire horrible
d'un homme innocent
presque mis à mort.
Le gouverneur de l'Illinois
- a mis un moratoire sur...
- George Ryan est un trou du cul.
Et si je veux en discuter,
j'irai à l'émission
"Rencontre avec
la Putain de Presse" !
Vous n'êtes pas le seul psy
en ville, ma Sœur.
Si vous ne voulez pas dire
qu'il est fou, j'irai ailleurs.
Bonjour, William.
Peter.
Peter Marie.
- Comment ça va ?
- Moïse...
... mort.
Seul.
Je m'en doute.
Vous savez, c'est
solitaire ici aussi.
Votre vie et les vies
de centaines
d'autres entre les mains
d'avocats et de politiciens.
Je me sens tellement...
impuissante.
Faiseuse de bruit.
Ouais, c'est moi.
Jouant du klaxon,
tapant sur des casseroles,
et pourtant,
rien n'a changé.
Nous.
Prier.
Dieu.
On a ça,
n'est-ce pas ?
Oui, William.
Nous.
Prier.
Dieu.
La cour suprême d'État, dans
une décision prise à 5 contre 4,
a déclaré la loi
sur la peine capitale
comme étant inconstitutionnelle,
se basant sur le cas d'un détenu
à la prison d'Oswald, qui a demandé
à être lapidé à mort.
Les juges de la cour suprême
ont déclaré qu'une telle exécution
serait cruelle et une punition
inhabituelle, nettement hors limites.
Mon soutien pour la peine
de mort est inconditionnel.
Cependant, la réaction du public
à cet incident
démontre que nous devrions
saisir cette occasion
pour prendre du recul.
Nous devons examiner
non seulement les moyens
par lesquels nous déterminons
une telle sentence,
mais les façons dont
nous l'appliquons.
Par conséquent, je réunis
un comité non partisan...
chargé de re-examiner tous
les aspects de la peine de mort.
Eh, Giles,
qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
J'croyais que t'étais
à moitié mort.
Non, je suis vivant. Vivant !
Vivant ?
Eh, agent Murphy,
j'me sens pas très bien.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Mal à la gorge.
T'est souvent malade
en ce moment.
Ce climat hivernal me tue.
Ben, j'ai une nouvelle
pour toi.
- Le docteur Nathan n'est pas là.
- Ah bon ?
Comment te sens-tu maintenant ?
J'veux aller voir mon frère
en quartier de protection.
Quel choc.
A mon avis, appeler quelqu'un
un "père parasite" n'est pas juste.
J'aurais envoyé
l'argent à mes gosses,
mais je savais que cette pute
le dépenserait
pour s'acheter des vêtements ou pour
le youpin hardi avec qui elle vit.
Ryan !
Eh, Cyril. Ça va,
mon frère ?
Tu vas bien ?
Quand... quand est-ce que
je peux partir d'ici ?
- Je peux revenir à Em City quand ?
- Je sais pas.
Le docteur Nathan va nous aider,
mais elle n'est pas là,
alors dès qu'elle revient,
on va s'en occuper.
Mon Dieu, c'est moche ici.
Je sais que tu t'ennuies.
Pas tant que ça...
maintenant qu'Henry est là.
Bonjour, je m'appelle Stanton,
Henry Stanton.
Vous êtes Ryan, c'est ça ?
Cyril m'a beaucoup
parlé de vous.
- T'as dit quoi ?
- Oh, rien d'incriminant.
C'est bien,
parce que un type
sous protection,
il a dû, quoi...
vendre ses amis ?
Non. Non,
un Aryen a menacé
de me séparer
de mes organes génitaux,
alors le directeur a pensé que ça
pourrait réduire les tensions.
Tu dis rien de nos affaires
à personne, Ok ?
Non.
Henry est sympa.
- J'aime bien ton frère.
- Eh !
Henry, tu permets ?
J'essaie d'avoir
une conversation privée ici.
Eh, je t'en prie !
Oh, bon Dieu.
- Tu veux quoi ?
- Juste parce qu'on baise plus
- on peut quand même être amis.
- Ouais, c'est ça.
Paraît qu'ils envoient
ton frère chez les cinglés.
Ouais, à cause de toi qui l'as accusé
de t'attaquer sans provocation.
- J'étais sympa et il m'a frappée.
- Sympa ?
- C'est ça.
- J'ai un marché.
J'vais dire au dirlo
de pas faire partir Cyril
si tu dis à Cyril
qu'il devrait
me laisser le baiser.
Quoi ?
- Je veux baiser ton frère.
- Sûrement pas.
Je ne veux pas que
tu t'approches de lui.
Ok, mais si je ne
m'approche pas de lui,
toi non plus.
Tu sais quoi, Howell ?
T'est une putain
de poufiasse cinglée.
Agent Dawg.
O'Reily.
Il est temps
Je suis affamé.
C'est plutôt calme
ici au J, hein ?
Ben, Basil mort,
Hughes en isolement,
c'est juste moi
et "sa majesté".
T'aimes pas Howell ?
C'est comme être enchaîné
à l'épouse de Frankenstein.
Eh, Alvin, mon pote,
T'aimerais avoir
des vivres en plus ?
Des barres de chocolat,
du pop-corn
pour ton micro-ondes ?
- Bien sûr.
- Tout ce que t'as à faire, c'est
t'assurer que Howell
ait un petit accident.
- Oh, j'suis pas un tueur.
- Non, non, non.
Je parle pas de tuer.
Je parle de...
une jambe cassée, un bras.
Juste quelque chose pour la mettre
hors circuit une semaine ou deux.
T'as presque fini,
O'Reily ?
Oh, ouais. J'ai fini.
Un coup de chance,
et elle est peut-être morte.
Au secours.
Au secours.
Au secours !
Au secours !
Au secours !
- Quoi de neuf ?
- Howell s'est cassé le bassin.
- Oh, chouette. Ça va la calmer.
- Pour un moment.
Oh, je pleure
des larmes invisibles.
Ça va ton nouveau
compagnon de cellule ?
Oh, Connolly est un con. Il dit que
je suis pas vraiment irlandais.
Il a essayé de faire
la même merde avec moi.
- T'inquiète pas, il va se calmer.
- Ouais.
Eh, Liam... fais des recherches
sur un certain Henry Stanton.
- Il est sous protection avec Cyril.
- Pas de problème.
Reste par terre.
Reste par terre.
Eh ! Qu'est-ce qui
se passe ici putain ?
Reste où t'es, O'Reily.
Ça te regarde pas.
Je vois deux lavettes cracheuses
de bibles s'attaquer à un ami catho ?
Ouais, ça me regarde.
Eh, allez, enculé.
J'vais pas t'en coller une,
Burns. Pas encore.
J'ai Dieu de mon côté.
Kirk, attends-moi
à la bibliothèque.
Burns, j'te parlerai
plus tard.
Toutes mes excuses,
monsieur.
Je te suis redevable.
Tu as d'abord fait
tabasser Samuel Gougeon,
puis Padraig Connolly,
tous deux contre mon gré.
Je fais le travail du Seigneur de
la meilleure façon que je connaisse.
Quand tu es venu me voir pour
demander à te convertir,
j'ai cru que ça signifiait que tu
voulais arrêter tes vieilles pratiques,
mais je vois maintenant
que j'avais tort.
Tu n'es plus membre
de ma congrégation.
- Quoi ?
- Je t'exclus.
- Vous ne pouvez pas.
- Laisse-moi partir.
- Je vous en prie.
- Laisse-moi partir !
En 1972, 14 catholiques
ont été massacrés.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont fait ?
Il ont commis le crime horrible
de descendre une rue à pied.
Ma mère est sortie
dans la rue en courant
et a attrapé le fils du voisin
qui courait avec les autres.
Pendant tout ce temps là...
un soldat britannique avait un L1A1
braqué sur elle,
et lui criait de rentrer.
Mais elle l'a pas fait...
et il a tiré.
Oh, merde.
On appelle ce jour là
"Dimanche ensanglanté".
C'est l'heure des visites.
Faut que j'y aille.
- Qui vient ?
- Ma mère.
Tu la traite bien
ta mère, Ryan ?
On a été séparés
depuis que j'étais bébé.
On vient
de se retrouver.
Mais, ouais,
je la traite bien.
Je sais que tu te demandes
pourquoi je suis partie,
et à chacune de mes visites
j'ai voulu tout te dire.
Eh, dis-moi maintenant.
Les années 60
étaient troublées.
Nous vivions dans un appartement
sans eau chaude près de l'université.
Et pendant que je faisais ce que la
plupart des épouses faisaient alors,
dehors, les rues étaient en feu
en signe de protestation.
- La guerre du Vietnam.
- Ouais. Je te sortais dans la foule
et j'écoutais les discours,
puis un jour,
quelque chose s'est déclanché
et j'ai dû m'engager.
Alors j'ai...
J'ai dû partir.
Pourquoi... pourquoi tu m'as pas
emmené avec toi ?
Et bien, parce que mes amis
se battaient pour la paix.
Nous nous sommes armés.
Nous étions militants.
- Et quelqu'un a été tué.
- Ouais.
- Et j'ai couru, j'ai continué à courir.
- Bon Dieu.
Alors maintenant, après 35 ans,
j'ai décidé d'arrêter le marathon.
Je vais me rendre.
- Mais que vas...
- Je ne sais pas ce qui va m'arriver,
et je ne sais pas
si j'irai en prison.
Mais je voulais te revoir
et passer quelques heures
avec toi
et te connaître un peu avant
que ce qui doit arriver n'arrive.
Non. Non.
Non, non, je peux pas
te perdre maintenant.
Pas après toutes ces années.
Bordel de merde.
- Ne te rends pas.
- Il le faut, Ryan.
Je ne suis pas bonne pour toi si je ne
suis pas honnête avec qui je suis.
Putain.
Écoute...
j'allais pas te le dire,
ou pas tout de suite.
Et si je te disais
que je peux tout arranger
pour qu'on puisse
être ensemble ?
Que veux-tu dire ?
Une amie à moi va nous aider
à nous évader, Cyril et moi.
Non, Ryan,
ne fais pas ça.
- Pourquoi pas bordel ?
- Parce que...
tu devras passer le reste de ta vie
à faire ce que j'ai fait,
te cacher et mentir
et vivre dans la peur...
et nier qui tu es.
Et c'est une vie
dénuée de sens.
Et une vie dénuée de sens
n'est pas une vie.
La visite est finie, O'Reily.
Maman.
Tu m'a appelée "Maman".
Je t'aime, Ryan.
Je t'ai toujours aimé
et je t'aimerai toujours.
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
Mauvaise nouvelle.
Le procureur général
a circonvenu la loi d'asile.
Vous voulez dire qu'on a
perdu le combat ?
Votre déportation
a été ordonnée.
Dans une semaine vous vous tiendrez
devant un juge britannique.
Là-bas je n'aurai pas
un procès juste. Je vais être exécuté.
Je sais.
Vous admettez l'avoir tué
même si vous savez
que je pourrais le dire au directeur et
que vous finiriez exécuté ?
Oui.
- Eh.
- Eh.
Comment va Cyril ?
Il est un peu anxieux
de sortir de protection
mais il va bien.
Eh, vous avez...
vous avez pensé
à ce dont on a parlé ?
Pensé ? Votre petite proposition m'a
tenue éveillée pendant trois nuits.
Et qu'avez-vous décidé ?
Tenez.
Pourquoi vous
me donnez ça ?
Il y a dix minutes,
le directeur m'a demandé
si j'avais des infos
sur la mort de Keenan.
- Quoi ?
- J'ai menti et j'ai dit "Non".
Oh, merde.
Merci mon Dieu.
Ryan, à l'instant même le conseil
médial est en train de décider
si je suis qualifiée ou non
pour tenir ce poste.
Ils mettent en doute
ma moralité, Ok ?
Ma première réaction a été
"Comment peuvent-ils faire ça"
Mais...
vous savez quoi ?
Maintenant je la remets
en question.
Écoutez.
L'amour est plus important
que la moralité.
Comment savez-vous ça ?
Je veux dire le peu de moralité,
que vous ayez,
est complètement déglinguée.
Ouah. Pourquoi
vous faites ça bon sang.
Je devrais dire à Leo que
vous avez battu Keenan à mort.
Je devrais le faire...
mais je ne le ferai pas.
Que Dieu m'aide.
- Eh, Gloria...
- Je n'aiderai pas à votre évasion.
Vous comprenez ?
Je ne le ferai pas.
Et si vous me
demandez encore,
je vais tout dire
au directeur.
Garde, nous avons fini.
J'ai une moralité,
et je ne suis pas déglingué.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
J'ai lu au sujet des troubles
dans l'ordinateur.
C'est pas tout
en rapport avec Dieu.
C'est à propos d'argent.
Les protestants qui prennent
les terres des catholiques.
Comment ne pas
détester les britanniques ?
Si vous avez des couilles alors
vous feriez mieux d'être dans l'I. R. A.
Tu sais, se battre
pour ce qui est à soi de droit.
Et qu'est-ce que ta nouvelle
connaissance
et tout cet enthousiasme a de bon
pour aucun de nous ?
Je veux faire partie
de quelque chose qui soit important.
Te moque pas de moi, Connolly.
Eh, tout le monde sait
que j'accomplis les choses.
C'est mon talent.
Laisse-moi t'aider pour la cause.
Quelque chose pour l'Irlande ?
Ok.
Je sais ce qu'on
devrait faire.
Eh.
- Deux gallons d'eau de javel.
- Bien.
Tous tes blancs
sont propres,
alors tu me dis pourquoi t'en avais
tellement besoin ?
Non. tu peux m'avoir
une montre ?
Une montre ?
Pourquoi ?
Connolly,
qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Tu voudrais mourir
avec moi ?
Hein ?
L'eau de javel et la montre
font partie de mon grand projet.
- Qui est quoi ?
- Fabriquer une bombe.
Toi et moi, O'Reily,
on va faire sauter
Emerald City.
Dans tous les sports,
pour connaître la victoire,
l'élément le plus nécessaire...
est le travail d'équipe.
Mais le travail d'équipe est aussi
une notion effrayante
face à laquelle une personne
peut se retrouver.
Faire équipe signifie abandonner
une partie de votre individualité,
être prêt à faire un sacrifice
si nécessaire pour la grande cause.
Si vous êtes prêt
à faire ces choses,
à vraiment devenir
un joueur d'équipe,
alors le succès va suivre.
Mais un mot
de mise en garde.
Soyez sûr que le succès
que vous recherchez...
est le succès
dont vous avez besoin.
Je me demandais.
Du moment o∙ l'on apprend Ó parler
Ó celui o∙ l'on meurt,
combien de mots
dit-on en moyenne ?
On n'arrĻte pas de parler,
on remplit l'ozone,
espķrant en secret qu'avec
toutes ces syllabes
on a dit quelque chose
qui mķrite d'Ļtre retenu.
Au fond,
nous savons la vķritķ.
La majoritķ de ce que
nous disons ne vaut rien.
Ouah, ouah, ouah,
o∙ tu vas comme ńa ?
O∙ tu crois que tu vas ?
- Faut que j'parle Ó Burr.
- Il est occupķ.
- J'vais attendre.
- Il sera jamais libre pour toi,
cafteur.
Stupide pute.
T'as pas beaucoup
de succĶs
Ó monter tes frĶres
contre Redding.
T'as aussi dit que Hill
allait tuer le vieux salaud.
T'inquiĶte pas.
Redding va mourir...
Et vite.
Fouille !
Non, non, non.
- C'est pas Ó moi.
- Dis pas de conneries.
Eh, Murph, c'est pas...
c'est pas Ó moi.
A moi non plus c'est s¹r.
Chez McManus.
- EmmĶne-le.
- C'est pas... allez. C'est mĻme pas...
Ma S£ur, ķcoutez,
vous me connaissez.
Ūa fait trois ans
que j'ai dķcrochķ.
C'est vrai, Tim. Je miserais
ma rķputation lÓ-dessus.
Si tu te cames pas,
alors tu vends.
Non, quelqu'un l'a mis
dans ma cellule.
- Pourquoi ?
- Je sais pas.
- La came appartient Ó White ?
- Non !
- Alors qui tu protĶges ?
- Personne !
Bien. Je vais
te renvoyer Ó Em City,
mais sans punition. Comme ńa
tous tes petits amis
- croiront que tu les as mouchardķs.
- Mettez-moi au trou.
- Garde.
- Mettez-moi au putain de trou !
Tu vois ce que
je veux dire ?
C'est Redding qui t'a piķgķ.
Peut-Ļtre que t'as arrangķ ńa.
Putain, j'ai pas Ó qui faire confiance.
C'est sans importance.
Redding te fait pas
et te fera jamais confiance.
T'as pas le choix : bute-le.
Je tue Redding,
et puis tu prends la tĻte.
J'oublierai pas
ce que t'as fait.
Ben, j'ai pas oubliķ
ce que t'as fait, toi,
me vendre aux flics.
J'te l'ai dit, j'essaie
de me racheter.
Et je t'ai dit de me laisser
putain de tranquille.
Tu sais, j'en ai assez
d'essayer de te faire plaisir.
J'vais m'en occuper
moi-mĻme.
Non, fais pas ńa.
Supreme. Supreme.
J'vais le tuer.
╔coute, s'il doit mourir, je prķfĶre
que ce soit de mes mains.
- J'vais le faire en douceur.
- Peu importe.
Fais le, c'est tout.
- Hardin.
- Tu voulais me voir ?
Tu vides toujours
les plat bassins ?
J'ai besoin
d'un dossier mķdical.
Poet ?
Eh, Poet ?
Me parle pas, mouchard.
En ce qui nous concerne,
t'es mort, un fant¶me.
- Un fant¶me sur roues.
- Eh, ķcoute.
J'veux sauver
la vie de Burr.
De quoi tu parles ?
Supreme Allah...
J'me souviens
quand on travaillait la rue
il ķtait mķga allergique
Ó quelque chose.
D'aprĶs son dossier,
c'est les £ufs.
Ouais, quand on prķparera
son repas, faut qu'on lui
prķpare de la bouffe
bien spķciale.
Pas aujourd'hui.
Mange bien.
Burr est toujours en vie.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Faut bien que je me
rapproche de lui, non ?
Faut que je retombe sous
ses bonnes grŌces.
Ūa va prendre du temps.
Ben, t'en as pas, du temps.
Quelque chose qui va pas ?
- Oh merde.
- C'est toi qu'as fait ńa, hein ?
Putain de... oh !
Poet m'a dit
ce que t'as fait.
Je suis venu
te remercier
et te souhaiter la bienvenue
dans le groupe.
J'accepte tes remerciements.
Mais je ne veux pas revenir.
Je ne veux pas vendre
de la drogue.
Comme tu veux.
Je respecte ńa.
Respecte ?
J'ai tuķ un homme.
J'ai causķ sa mort.
Et mĻme si Allah
allait te faire du mal,
mĻme si cet enculķ
m'a clouķ dans ce fauteuil,
j'suis pas fier
de ce que j'ai fait.
Ben, alors, Augustus,
j'tai bien ķlevķ.
Ma fille vient aujourd'hui. Elle a
quelque chose d'important Ó me dire.
Quand la visite sera finie,
j'ai une tŌche pour toi.
J'te l'ai dit.
J'suis lÓ pour toi.
"Trou du fut" Morales.
Et Pancamo ?
Son heure viendra,
mais Morales part en premier.
- Eh.
- Patricia.
Qu'est-ce que t'as
Ó me dire ?
Ben dis donc, Papa, pas de
"Tu vas bien ? Ta mĶre aussi ? ".
T'as de mauvaises nouvelles ?
Tu quittes pas l'armķe au moins ?
ArrĻte de faire
une tĻte pareille.
Je me marie.
Marie ?
Avec Max ?
Bien s¹r
avec Max.
C'est merveilleux.
J'suis si content pour toi.
Merci.
Papa, le truc c'est que...
comme tu ne seras pas lÓ
pour me conduire Ó l'autel,
je pensais
demander Ó Myran.
Je sais ce que
tu penses de lui
mais lui et maman
sont mariķs depuis 20 ans.
J'ai... j'ai grandi
dans sa maison.
J'ai du travail Ó faire.
Papa, j'ai besoin
de ta rķponse.
Fais ce que tu
putain de veux.
Ce bon sang de truc
s'est arrĻtķ net.
On a pu sortir le directeur,
mais faut le rķparer illico.
Vous Ļtes dans la mķcanique,
alors vous pourriez jeter un £il.
Oh, ķtant gamin je rķparais
des ascenseurs chez Otis.
J'les connais
comme ma poche.
Ouah, Otis.
T'ķtais Ó la cantine quand le type noir
a cassķ sa pipe ?
Supreme Allah ?
Ouais.
Dr¶le de fańon de crever.
Passe-moi une clķ.
La vie est plut¶t
prķcaire par ici.
Ouais ? Encore plus
qu'au Vietnam ?
Les mines sont encore
moins visibles Ó Oz.
Les amis vendent leurs amis,
les ennemis se lĶchent le cul.
J'ai pas l'habitude
de ce genre de comportement.
J'aime savoir qui sont
mes adversaires.
LĶve-toi !
LĶve-toi !
Bon voyage, soldat.
Quand quelqu'un meurt, on examine
la derniĶre chose qu'il ou elle a dit
dans l'espoir d'y trouver
une grande vķritķ.
Une vķritķ profonde Ó laquelle ceux
qui restent peuvent se raccrocher.
Comme l'ķcrivain,
Daniel Defoe,
"Je ne sais pas
ce qui est le plus difficile,
bien vivre
ou bien mourir".
A Oz, on fait
ni l'un ni l'autre.
Jeremiah, la raison
de ma visite est...
et je voulais
faire ńa face Ó face.
Le conseil des anciens
s'est rķuni hier et ils ont dķcidķ
de demander
votre dķmission
de la direction
de la nouvelle Eglise du Christ.
Les anciens ont votķ Ó l'unanimitķ
le jour de ma condamnation
qu'ils me soutiendraient
- co¹te que co¹te.
- Je sais.
Mais le scandale a sķrieusement
freinķ les dons.
Je veux parler
aux anciens.
Comment, par satellite ?
Ils peuvent venir ici, Ó Oz.
Oh, Jeremiah,
soyez sķrieux.
Ces vieillards
ne vont pas venir ici.
La lettre de dķmission.
Signez.
Cloutier pense qu'il est mieux
que nous tous.
- Comment ńa ?
- On nous fait faire du travail
physique.
Cloutier a un travail confortable
au bureau des rķclamations.
On charge du ciment,
lui il joue du stylo.
Il devrait trimer
avec nous.
Tu sĶmes encore
du mķcontentement ?
Je dis juste les choses
comme elles sont.
LĶve-toi.
Je vous ai dit pourquoi
il m'a vidķ de la congrķgation ?
Pas parce que j'ai
menacķ quelqu'un
au nom du Seigneur,
mais parce que
je l'ai contredit.
Il essaie de faire taire
quiconque a un avis diffķrent.
Jim, escortez
cet homme dehors.
Il a le droit d'aller
au bout de sa pensķe.
D'accord,
qu'il parle.
Excusez-moi
une seconde.
Hoyt,
tu veux toujours faire du mal
au Rķvķrend Cloutier ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu le veux mort ?
Pas... exactement mort.
C'est ńa que tu cherches ?
Donne-moi
la serviette.
Et alors, ńa prouve
que tu es plus fort que moi ?
En force brute, peut-Ļtre,
mais j'ai le pouvoir
de Jķsus de mon c¶tķ.
Tant mieux.
Alors dis au Seigneur Jķsus
de te donner une autre serviette.
Quand j'avais 10 ans, mon pĶre
prĻchait la Bible de ville en ville.
Il m'a appelķ au podium.
J'avais 10 ans.
J'ai touchķ les yeux d'un homme
aveugle et il a ķtķ guķri.
A partir de ce moment lÓ,
j'ai ķtķ... spķcial, cķlĶbre.
Partout, la tķlķ et des gens
qui voulaient me toucher.
Ouah. Ūa doit Ļtre
quelque chose.
Je ne connaissais rien d'autre
que la cķlķbritķ.
Appartements luxueux,
limousines.
Quand j'ai pris l'argent
de ma congrķgation,
je n'ai mĻme pas pensķ
que je volais.
Il semblait que je prenais
ce qui me revenait.
╔coutez-moi.
L'orgueil.
L'orgueil est le pire des pķchķs
car c'est l'orgueil
qui nous sķpare de Dieu.
La dķlivrance
vient de Jķsus.
Oui, et il m'a rabaissķ.
Afin de regagner
votre congrķgation,
montrez-leur que vous n'Ļtes pas
leur supķrieur mais leur ķgal.
Comment je fais ńa ?
En vous joignant Ó eux
dans leur travail.
"Le salaire du juste
procure la vie".
Les trois derniers mots prononcķs
par Jķsus furent "Tout est accompli".
╔tant le fils de Dieu,
il savait probablement
que la fin ķtait proche
et il a eu l'occasion
de penser quoi dire.
Nous autres,
nous n'avons pas ce luxe.
Quand la mort vient,
c'est une surprise,
et il faut improviser.
J'aime autant vous dire, Cloutier,
vous m'avez fait bonne impression.
Vous avez vraiment
rķpondu Ó l'appel.
Vos disciples
sont morts de rire de vous voir
m'aider Ó construire ce mur.
Je t'en prie, rķflķchis
Ó ce que tu fais.
Oh, j'y ai bien rķflķchi.
Quand on demandera o∙ vous Ļtes,
je dirai "Je sais pas.
Peut-Ļtre qu'il
est montķ aux cieux".
Au secours !
Au secours !
Aidez-moi !
Il ne peuvent pas vous aider.
Y'a personne, vous vous souvenez ?
Et j'ai filķ 200 $ aux gardes-chiourme
pour qu'ils aillent se promener.
Vous allez tous les deux br¹ler
en enfer pour l'ķternitķ.
Vous auriez juste d¹ accepter
la pipe quand je l'ai offerte.
Au secours !
Aidez-moi !
Au secours ! Aidez-moi !
Au secours !
Yahvķ est mon berger,
rien ne me manque.
Il me guide aux sentiers de justice
Ó cause de son nom.
Passerais-je
un ravin de tķnĶbre,
je ne crains aucun mal !
Oh, putain.
Hughes ?
Eh, j'me sens
pas trĶs bien.
Putain !
Eh, bande de stupides enculķs,
ķcoutez bien !
Par la prķsente, je dķclare
ce quartier la rķpublique de Huhru.
Hurhu ! Huhru ! Huhru !
- T'es putain de cinglķ ?
- Jusqu'Ó ce que
nous puissions organiser
des ķlections libres et justes
j'assurerai le commandement.
Dorķnavant vous m'appellerez
"Votre Excellence".
Huges, t'es putain de tarķ !
Pour cette insubordination, Alvarez,
vous resterez dans votre cellule.
En fait, jusqu'Ó ce que vous ayez tous
prouvķ votre loyautķ
Ó notre nouvelle rķpublique,
et au principes ķnoncķs
dans mon manifeste
vous resterez
lÓ o∙ vous Ļtes.
Eh, ouvre
cette putain de porte !
Amenez un putain
de garde ici.
Centrale, ici Gamba Kufu,
prķsident par intķrim
de la rķpublique de Huhru.
Je veux parler
au directeur Leo Glynn.
Allo ?
Oui.
Oh, je vais le lui dire.
Tu ferais mieux d'arrĻter ces bĻtises
et de te rendre tout de suite.
Et tu ferais bien de fermer
ta gueule, Smith,
ou tu vas te retrouver avec ma bite
en train de chercher ta prostate.
Clayton, ici Leo.
Vous m'appellerez Gamba Kufu
ou Votre Excellence.
- Clayton...
- Gamba !
Comment va l'agent Smith ?
Ben, ńa dķpend de vous.
- ╔coute-moi, Clayton...
- Gamba.
- Clayton !
- En attendant que vous montriez
le respect qui convient
Ó ma haute position,
je mets fin
Ó cette conversation.
- Vous avez la clķ ?
- Elle arrive.
Je veux que vous ouvriez la porte.
Je vais entrer en premier.
Je vous le dķconseille,
monsieur.
C'est pas de l'hķro’sme,
commandant.
C'est de la bonne vieille culpabilitķ.
Eh, ton Excellence.
T'as l'air de tout avoir
sous contr¶le.
Mais j'veux m'assurer que tu vas pas
tous nous faire tuer
et j'veux savoir
quel est ton plan.
- Mon plan ?
- Ouais.
Parce que pendant l'ķmeute
il y a quelques annķes...
Said, Adebisi,
et les autres,
ils avaient ķtabli
une stratķgie.
Pender, ton expķrience te rend
inestimable Ó la rķvolution.
Je te dķclare
vice-prķsident par intķrim.
- Quel honneur.
- PrĻt Ó prĻter serment ?
Je crois pas qu'on aura le temps,
d'un moment Ó l'autre
nos amis CRS vont arriver
et on va se faire faucher.
Comme Napolķon
au retour d'Elbe,
je vais parler aux hommes et les
convaincre de changer de camp.
Ok, mais si
ńa marche pas,
tu pourrais utiliser
ton otage comme bouclier.
- Excellente idķe.
- Ouais.
Putain, les voilÓ !
Hello, Leo.
Bienvenue Ó Huhru.
Je t'ai jamais menti,
n'est-ce pas ?
Alors je veux que
tu ķcoutes bien ce que je dis.
Les pensķes dans ta tĻte
ne sont pas rķelles.
Tu as passķ trop
de temps seul.
Tu as crķķ un monde
dans ta tĻte.
Huhru n'existe pas.
Ton nom est
Clayton Hughes.
Je m'appelle
Gamba Kufu.
Ton nom est
Clayton Hughes,
et tu es perdu.
Je veux t'aider.
Je me souviens
du jour o∙ mon...
pĶre est mort.
J'me sentais comme ńa.
J'me souviens de vous
et moi Ó l'h¶pital.
Vous m'aviez pris
dans vos bras.
Ūa me manque, Leo.
Vous pouvez
me prendre dans vos bras ?
J'vais me rendre si vous
me prenez dans vos bras.
D'accord.
Ūa va, Clayton.
Tout va bien aller.
Eh !
- Commandant !
- Allez, allez ! Bougez !
Oh, putain !
J'ai sauvķ votre putain
de vie, Glynn !
Vous m'Ļtes redevable !
Vous m'Ļtes redevable !
Clayton. Oh mon Dieu.
Clayton... mon Dieu.
Mon plan a marchķ
Ó la perfection.
Prenez-moi
dans vos bras, Leo.
Dans vos bras.
Dans vos bras, Leo.
- Prenez-moi dans vos bras.
- Oh, mon Dieu.
Tout le monde ne quitte pas le monde
des mortels misķrable et confus.
Ethel Waters disait "Je n'ai pas peur
de mourir, mon chķri.
En fait, j'attends un peu ńa
avec impatience.
Je sais que le Seigneur
a les bras autour
du gros moineau
bien gras que je suis".
Je vais m'en aller,
Ó moins que vous n'ayez
besoin de quelque chose.
Aujourd'hui, j'ai d¹ appeler
la veuve de mon meilleur ami
et l'informer que son
unique enfant ķtait mort.
Qu'il ķtait mort dans mes bras
tout comme son pĶre.
Je ne veux jamais plus avoir
Ó faire un appel comme ńa.
Il y a une derniĶre chose
que vous pouvez faire.
J'vais vous dicter
une lettre.
A Martin Douglas...
Commissaire,
au Bureau des Prisons.
Cher Martin, je dķmissionne
de mon poste de directeur
de l'ķtablissement correctionnel
d'╔tat d'Oswald,
Ó partir du jour o∙ un remplańant
pourra Ļtre trouvķ.
Pourquoi avez-vous
arrĻtķ d'ķcrire ?
Parce que
vous ne le pensez pas vraiment.
Oh, si, Floria.
Il est temps que je fasse autre chose,
de plus grand, que je sorte d'ici.
Non... vous faites
beaucoup de bien ici.
Je fais de la merde !
Cette lettre partira demain
Ó la premiĶre heure.
Ok, et si on allait dŅner ?
Non, ńa va aller.
Je ne vais pas
vous laisser comme ńa.
Je vais voir la maman
de Clayton.
Mon ķpouse y est dķjÓ.
Nous allons passer du temps
ensemble, pleurer,
nous rappeler le bon temps
et essayer de trouver
un bonne raison Ó...
ce qui n'en a pas.
Bonsoir.
T'as des nouvelles
de Dave Brass ?
Il est sorti de l'h¶pital,
mais sa jambe est foirķe.
Il ne rejouera jamais
au basket.
Il paraŅt que le dernier match
a ķtķ annulķ.
Glynn m'a dit
que c'ķtait ta dķcision.
Et alors ?
Quelle diffķrence ńa fait ?
- J'veux prendre la place de Brass.
- Quoi ?
Je veux qu'on fasse
le dernier match ensemble.
Va te faire foutre.
Parce que j'avais refusķ ?
- C'est ńa !
- Ok, ben, j'suis un con !
Mais ķcoute, Tim,
tu m'as convaincu.
Je t'ai observķ.
T'as jouķ avec tout ton putain de c£ur
dans ces deux matchs.
Mais Brass,
c'ķtait un joueur phķnomķnal.
Personne n'a d¹ remarquer
comme tu jouais bien.
Et c'est pas l'idķe
derriĶre tout ńa ?
Montrer Ó ces enfoirķs que si l'on
se donne Ó quelque chose...
- On ne peut pas gagner.
- Je sais.
Mais si on pouvait
leur tenir tĻte,
deux mecs blancs
dans des corps minables,
se mesurant Ó Vayhue.
Ūa voudrait dire
quelque chose.
Je sais pas pourquoi
je veux t'aider,
mais je ne vais pas
te laisser tomber, Omar.
Tu comprends ?
Je ne vais pas laisser tomber.
Merci.
Eh, Omar.
Quoi de neuf ?
Tu sais que je touche plus
Ó cette merde.
- Appelle-moi M. Propre.
- Oh ouais. Oh merde.
- Bonjour.
Eh, Mac Papa McManus.
Ūa va ? Le week-end
ķtait bon ?
Ouais. J'ai bien travaillķ.
Travaillķ ?
Quoi, pas de loisirs ?
Pas d'interludes romantiques ?
Si. Samedi soir je suis sorti
avec une danseuse portugaise.
Quoi, une strip-teaseuse ?
- Non, non, une ballerine.
- Une ballerine ?
Ces putes du ballet,
elles sont trop maigres.
On dirait des garńons ados.
Faut que vous vous trouviez
une strip-teaseuse.
- A bient¶t, Ok, Omar ?
- J'peux monter avec vous ?
Ben, tu sais... non.
Laisse-moi m'installer, Ok ?
Oh, Ok.
Y'a un problĶme ? Quelque chose
qui ne peut pas attendre ?
Ben, non, c'est juste que
j'ai un peu la tremblote,
si vous voyez ce que je veux dire.
Ouais, Ok.
Viens.
Allez. Allez.
Ouais, faut vous trouver
une strip-teaseuse.
J'en ai eu une, une pute
du nom d'Angelina.
Ouah ! Et cette pute
savait sucer une bite.
Omar a arrĻtķ la drogue depuis
des semaines maintenant.
Il va en thķrapie rķguliĶrement,
il suit des cours,
il fait son travail.
C'est devenu
un prisonnier modĶle.
- Et il vous rend dingue.
- Oui !
Quand je suis Ó Em City,
il me suit,
partout, comme un gamin
de deux ans.
Et il arrĻte pas
de parler de rien.
Et alors ? Dis Ó cet abruti
de dķgager.
Et risquer qu'il replonge ?
Pas question.
Ben alors, comme
disent les franńais,
t'es dans la merde
jusqu'au cou.
Pour la deuxiĶme
semaine consķcutive,
nous avons un nouveau candidat
et une nouvelle cķlķbritķ.
Un homme sorti de prison
juste pour nous.
- Bienvenue Ó Tim McManus.
- Quoi ?
Bordel de merde, regarde ńa.
Cet enculķ de McManus Ó la tķlķ.
Et je veux vous prķsenter
notre jeune star.
C'est l'autre Tony Soprano,
Robert ╬ler.
- Robert, merci...
- Faut faire installer le cŌble.
On rate tout
ce qu'il y a de bien.
Eh, il paraŅt que les femmes dans
"Sex and the City" sont sexy.
- Sexy !
- Je la baiserais cette Sarah machin.
Vous pouvez fermer
vos gueules ? Merde.
Nous commenńons
avec 10 dollars,
et la catķgorie du jour,
Tim, est "vocabulaire".
Question : Qu'est-ce qu'un
"signe diacritique" ?
Je pense que je sais.
Pour vous faire plaisir,
je vais demander de l'aide.
Vous avez vu ńa
en sixiĶme, Robert ?
Ben, d'abord,
je suis au lycķe.
Et ouais, on a vu ńa
au CE2.
Vous voulez lui donner
un indice, Robert ?
On le trouve avec
des croix sur des "t".
J'ai vu une ķmission
sur les "Signes diacritiques",
et c'ķtait pas
de la ponctuation.
Ouais, c'est pas de la ponctuation.
C'est une marque de distinction.
- Le gosse a raison.
- C'est bien, Robert,
mais j'ai un peu
plus d'expķrience.
Le "signe diacritique" parle
des implants mammaires.
Faut qu'il parle de seins
ce McManus.
En fait, c'est un point
au dessus d'un "i".
J'ai toujours su que McManus ķtait
idiot. Maintenant tout le monde le sait.
Eh, te fous pas
de sa gueule, Ok ?
Oh, dķsolķ, White.
J'ai oubliķ que
tu suńais sa bite.
Je lui suce pas
la bite, pķdale.
Alors tu dois
te faire enculer.
- Oh.
- EspĶce d'enculķ !
- Oh, merde !
- Enculķ !
- Enculķ !
- Centrale, ici 11. Nous avons un 66.
Sors de lÓ !
- Pedro Calderon est mort.
- Ce putain de mķtĶque m'a attaquķ.
- AprĶs que tu aies attaquķ Guerra !
- Il se moquait de vous !
Le directeur veut
que tu ailles en isolement.
Vous avez promis de
pas me laisser tomber.
- Qu'ils ne me reprendraient jamais.
- J'ai essayķ.
J'ai essayķ autant
que j'ai pu. J'ai perdu.
J'vais pas survivre en isolement,
putain, vous comprenez ?
Y'a pas d'air et trop
de temps mort !
- Je peux pas !
- Je n'y peux rien.
EspĶce d'enculķ.
EspĶce d'enculķ.
Putain de menteur !
Vous m'avez putain de menti !
- Calme-toi, White.
- Toi, tu te putain de calme !
Enculķ de menteur.
Vous m'avez putain de menti !
EspĶce de putain, d'enculķ,
de suceur de bite de menteur !
Vous m'avez menti !
Tout le monde me putain
de ment tout le temps.
Vous aviez dit que vous ne me
laisseriez jamais tomber.
Je veux pas retourner.
Laissez-moi partir !
Vous avez menti !
Ok, c'est tout, Tim.
Vous devriez rentrer chez vous.
J'vais vous conduire.
White avait raison.
Je ne me suis pas assez battu.
Je voulais perdre. Je voulais
qu'il aille en isolement.
- Je le savais.
- pourquoi ?
Vous n'avez pas tapķ des pieds
quand j'ai refusķ de vous ķcouter.
Je le veux vraiment
Ó Em City.
Il vous a dķjÓ poignardķ
et maintenant il vous a tabassķ.
Je m'en moque. Qu'il continue
Ó donner des coups de pied.
J'ai perdu ce match de basket
parce que j'ai perdu espoir.
Je n'abandonnerai pas
Omar White.
Restez chez vous quelques jours,
pensez-y, et on en reparlera.
Ok, mais je ne vais pas
changer d'avis, Leo,
parce que si je laisse tomber
un seul de ces types,
autant ouvrir un petit resto et faire
griller des steaks jusqu'Ó ma mort.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je pourrais bien
me joindre Ó vous.
En 1955, James Dean
a dit Ó un ami,
"Les beaux jours
sont terminķs".
Une heure aprĶs : un accident
de voiture, il est mort.
Une prophķtie qui s'est rķalisķe,
ou juste de la malchance ?
Eh, ńa s'est bien passķ ?
J'ai donnķ du sang. Ils font
un prķlĶvement sur le bķbķ.
Si les deux correspondent,
c'est ma petite fille.
Pendant que t'ķtais parti, j'ai appris
quelque chose sur Beecher.
- Quoi, Beecher ?
- Tu sais qu'il pourrait Ļtre relŌchķ ?
Non.
Il doit passer devant le conseil
cette semaine.
Nom de Dieu.
D'aprĶs la rumeur, cet enculķ
a une bonne chance de sortir.
Donne-moi cette canne.
On a les unies ?
Vern, Beecher a fait foirer
ta libertķ conditionnelle.
Tu crois pas que je m'en
putain de souviens ?
Sans ńa, tes fils seraient peut-Ļtre
en vie et ta petite fille...
Ferme ta putain de gueule !
- Pourquoi tu me l'as pas dit ?
- Vern...
Pourquoi tu ne m'as pas dit
que tu pourrais Ļtre en conditionnelle ?
- C'est pas un bon dķbut d'interaction.
- ne vous mĻlez pas de ńa !
Et l'honnĻtetķ alors ?
- Garde !
- Faut qu'on soit au mĻme niveau.
- La sķance est terminķe.
- Tu le savais pendant tout ce temps.
- Bien, Schillinjer.
- C'est "Schillinger" !
Bordel de merde.
"Schillinger" !
Neuf putain d'annķes
que j'suis ici,
et vous Ļtes pas foutu
de dire mon bon sang de nom.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Il va faire quelque chose
pour faire foirer mon entretien.
Non, non, non.
Je vais lui parler.
- Ūa servira Ó rien.
- Tobias, je vais lui parler.
J'suis foutu.
Eh, mon pote.
On peut bouffer ici ?
- Tu manges pas cette orange ?
- Et ce lait, hein ?
Je suis dķsolķ de pas t'avoir dit
pour la libertķ conditionnelle.
La vķritķ c'est que je crois
pas vraiment que ńa va arriver.
Oh, si.
Si ces suceurs de bites du conseil
voient un riche garńon comme toi,
pleurnicher, leurs petits c£urs
vont se fendre.
- ╔coute...
- Tu vas pas Ļtre libķrķ, pute.
Tu va pas sortir d'ici
sans moi.
Nettoie ce putain
de merdier.
J'ai parlķ Ó Schillinger.
Il a dit tout ce qu'il fallait.
Il s'est excusķ.
Il a expliquķ combien les sķances
d'interaction lui faisaient du bien.
- Il ment.
- Je sais.
Vous pouvez me mettre
sous protection ?
Normalement je le ferais,
mais ils sont complets.
Ben, alors mettez
Schillinger en isolement.
Il n'a encore rien fait.
De plus le quartier est complet.
- Ben, merde, bloquez la prison !
- Juste pour toi, Beecher ?
Soyons sķrieux. Tu vas rester dans
ta cellule. Tu y prendras tes repas.
J'vais mettre un agent
devant ta porte. Tout ira bien.
Pourquoi je ne me
sens pas soulagķ ?
Arif ! Ces motards
prķparent quelque chose.
Il veulent provoquer Beecher
Ó commettre un acte de violence,
- et perde ses chances de libertķ.
- Ouais
Et je vais m'assurer
que ńa n'arrive pas.
- Et tu fais tout ńa pour Beecher ?
- Oh ouais,
et pour Salah Yudin,
et toutes ces autres vies
que les Aryens
ont dķjÓ dķtruites.
Hoyt ne peut pas
approcher Beecher.
Oh, putain !
- Son entretien est quand ?
- Demain Ó 11h00.
Oh, merde.
Tiens, tiens, tiens...
Si c'est pas
mon vieil ami,
James Robson.
Said, j'ai promis au directeur qu'il n'y
aurait pas de problĶmes entre nous.
Garde...
Vous feriez bien
de rester tout prĶs.
Pourrait y avoir
du grabuge.
Je peux voir Beecher ?
Tu tiens le coup ?
J'ai juste Ó tenir
encore une nuit.
J'ai ķtķ trĶs clair
avec Schillinger.
Si on te fait du mal,
il va sentir
toute la colĶre d'Allah.
C'est sympa, Kareem.
Assalaam Alayka,
mon frĶre.
Que la paix soit aussi avec toi.
Bien que d'aprĶs
ce que je vois,
tu n'as pas vraiment
la paix, hein ?
Je lutte, tout comme toi.
Tu sais...
quand j'ķtais perturbķ
par ma responsabilitķ
dans la mort
d'Andrew Schillinger, tu m'as dit
d'accepter ma culpabilitķ ou
elle me rongerait pour toujours.
C'est dr¶le que tu n'aies pas appliquķ
ton propre conseil pour Adebisi.
Combien de fois je dois
te le dire, Tobias ?
J'me sens pas coupable
de l'avoir tuķ.
T'es pas hantķ par sa mort,
mais par sa vie.
- Sa force de vie.
- Elle me hante ?
Qu'est-ce que
tu racontes ?
J'ai vu ton visage
juste aprĶs que tu l'aies tuķ,
et un petit peu d'Adebisi
s'ķtait infiltrķ en toi.
- Non.
- Sa colĶre...
- Sa violence...
- Non, tu as tort !
Toute ta vie, tu as fermement
contr¶lķ tes sentiments.
Tu as reniķ l'Adebisi en toi,
mais tu ne le peux plus le faire.
Faut que tu en fasses
une partie de toi, Kareem.
Fais-le devenir
une partie de toi.
Ils ne vont pas prendre
mes mains moites
pour un signe
d'intention criminelle, n'est-ce pas ?
Allons, soyez relax.
Ūa fait six ans que je m'occupe
de ce genre de cas.
Je n'ai jamais ķtķ plus s¹re
du rķsultat de ma vie.
Ouais, ben vous ne m'avez
jamais eu comme client.
J'ai un cadeau pour vous.
J'ai pas eu le temps
de l'envelopper.
- Un carnet de rendez-vous.
- Ouais.
M. Beecher ?
- Nous vous attendons.
- Ok.
Souhaitez-moi
bonne chance.
Je vais faire
plus que ńa.
Je vais faire quelque chose
de pas professionnel du tout.
M. Beecher.
Ouais, je viens.
Allez.
Puis ils m'ont fait parler de ma
dķfķcation sur le visage de Schillinger
et de la fois o∙ j'ai mordu
le bout du pķnis de Robson.
J'suis pas s¹r qu'ils aient
aimķ mes rķponses.
Ils ont votķ oui.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Oh, mon...
Oh, mon Dieu.
- Tobias ?
- Je rentre Ó la maison.
Je rentre Ó la maison.
- Putain d'incroyable !
- Oh, mon Dieu !
Putain !
Enculķ !
- Super, Beecher.
- Ferme ta gueule.
- Beecher est libre.
- Non.
Non. je le veux mort.
T'as compris ? Beecher
ne sort pas d'Oz en vie.
Courrier !
Allez, en rang !
- Y'a une lettre pour Beecher.
- J'vais la lui donner.
Eh ! Eh ! Eh !
EspĶce d'enculķ !
Enculķ !
Louisa, maintenez-lui bien
les mains, s'il vous plait.
Vous allez me manquer.
Surtout pas. Essayez de
ne mĻme pas penser Ó cet endroit.
Ce sera difficile.
J'ai toujours une croix gammķe
tatouķe sur les fesses.
Soyez fort.
Aimez votre fille.
Aimez vous vous-mĻme.
Alors...
vous pensez pouvoir faire
ce que la S£ur a dit,
- ne pas penser Ó Oz ?
- Ouais.
Le prisonnier
numķro 97B41 2 est mort.
Je laisse toute
sa merde derriĶre moi.
Puis ils m'ont fait parler de ma
dķfķcation sur le visage de Schillinger
et de la fois o∙ j'ai mordu
le bout du pķnis de Robson.
J'suis pas s¹r qu'ils aient
aimķ mes rķponses.
- Alors ?
- Dķsolķe, Tobias, ils ont votķ non.
Ils ont ķtķ impressionnķs par
vos progrĶs des dernier mois,
mais n'ont pas pensķ que ńa
compensait tous les incidents d'avant.
Putain de bon Dieu.
Je suis dķsolķe de vous avoir fait
espķrer un rķsultat plus positif.
Je suis complĶtement
et absolument sous le choc.
Je sais que vous avez
fait de votre mieux.
Ils ont dit Ļtre ouverts
Ó une autre ķvaluation dans un an.
Un an ?
Une autre annķe.
Putain d'Oz.
Tobias.
- Emmenez-moi Ó ma cellule.
- Tobias, restez pour discuter un peu.
Plus tard.
Je veux Ļtre seul.
Beecher.
Je suis tellement content qu'on puisse
continuer Ó interagir.
M'approche pas, putain.
Allons, allons,
sois pas amer.
Faisons la paix
et embrassons-nous, hein ?
Je t'ai prķvenu
de ne pas l'approcher.
Non !
Il est Ó moi.
Adebisi est en vie.
Ok, Vern,
bougez votre pied.
Pouvez-vous bouger vos pieds ?
Mettez le sous perfusion.
- Enculķ !
- Il m'en faut encore, tout de suite.
- Tout va bien. Enlevez votre main.
- Putain !

UNE EXCLUSIVITE HBO
LES DIVAS DU STRING
J'vous l'ai pas dit,
bande d'enculķs ?
Le cŌble,
c'est ce qu'il y a de mieux !
O'Reily.
O'Reily !
- Quoi ?!
- Un paquet.
- C'est la montre ?
- Ouais.
La derniĶre piĶce
pour la bombe.
- On va la faire sauter Ó la rķcrķ ?
- Le meilleur moment.
Le gymnase sera pas touchķ
vu qu'il est si loin d'Em City.
T'es s¹r que
tu veux le faire ?
Le gouvernement amķricain
a fait de moi un prisonnier de guerre.
On me renvoie en Angleterre
uniquement pour raisons politiques,
et c'est pas juste.
Alors il faut agir.
Notre action isolķe
va changer quelque chose ?
Peut-Ļtre.
Probablement pas.
Alors tu dis que c'est pas la bataille,
mais la guerre ?
Je dis que si on doit jamais gagner
la guerre, c'est Ó Dieu d'en dķcider.
Pour l'homme
il y a juste le combat.
Se battre pour se battre.
C'est tellement cinglķ.
Non, se battre parce qu'on doit toujours
foncer sur l'injustice en tĻte premiĶre.
Vivre comme ńa.
On ne gagne peut-Ļtre pas,
mais on s'assure
de ne jamais jamais perdre.
- Ryan !
- Salut, gamin.
- Ūa va ?
- Tu te sens bien ?
Ouais.
Je ne sais pas comment vous
remercier de m'avoir renvoyķ Cyril.
Je ne l'ai pas transfķrķe
pour vous, Ryan.
Je l'ai fait parce que
c'est la chose Ó faire.
Non, je le sais bien,
vous faites toujours
ce qui est juste, moral.
C'est pour cela que je vous aime.
Embrassez-moi.
Garde !
Ramenez O'Reily
Ó Em City.
Eh, je voulais pas
vous contrarier, vous savez ?
Je voulais juste dire que j'ai toutes
les raisons de vivre maintenant.
Eh...
Faut qu'on parle. ╔coute,
faut annuler l'opķration.
Putain, baisse d'un ton.
On en parlera plus tard.
Non, plus tard,
ce sera trop tard.
On va finir par tuer
beaucoup de gens
- qui ne devraient pas mourir.
- On en a dķjÓ parlķ.
Em City sera
pratiquement vide.
J'vais prķvenir les gardes.
Ils auront cinq minutes
pour tout ķvacuer.
- Non. Et s'ils agissent pas assez vite ?
- J'ai pas le contr¶le lÓ-dessus.
Et si l'explosion touche
d'autres secteurs,
d'autres quartiers, l'h¶pital,
les salles de visites ?
On y peut rien.
Non. ╔coute, j'ai tuķ
n'importe qui pour n'importe quoi.
Alors je vais pas essayer
de prendre mes grands airs avec toi.
Je sais que cette mission
a un sens pour toi.
Mais pour moi, je vois ce que
nous nous prķparons Ó faire,
et pour la premiĶre fois
de ma misķrable putain de vie,
j'ai l'impression
de comprendre enfin.
Comprendre ?
Comprendre quoi ?
Nos actes, c'est ce qui fait
qui nous sommes.
Et jusqu'Ó maintenant, mes actes
se rķsument Ó un tas de merde.
Eh, bon Dieu, Porrick,
j'ai un frĶre
et mĻme une femme
dans ces murs qui croient en moi.
Ils ont cru en moi quand je ne leur
donnais rien pour le justifier.
Dans une heure,
on va accomplir notre mission.
- Va te faire foutre !
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
J'ai toujours ķtķ celui
qui marche droit, la tĻte haute,
mais ńa a toujours ķtķ
juste pour la frime.
Pour une fois je vais gagner
le droit de marcher comme ńa.
Eh, excusez-moi.
Faut que je retourne
Ó Em City. Y'a urgence.
O'Reily, ńa va pas bordel ?
T'as encore laissķ
le gaz allumķ.
- Va l'ķteindre.
- Non, tu vas l'ķteindre.
O∙ tu vas ? J'vais pas faire
ton putain de travail.
Non. J'emmĶne cette putain
de bombe aux gardes-chiourme.
Relax, Ryan.
Ūa m'a pris une minute,
mais ce que t'as dit
Ó la cantine
commence Ó pķnķtrer les paroisses
ķpaisses de mon crŌne.
Ouais ? Bon Dieu. ╔coute,
c'est bien, Porrick,
on peut toujours
se battre pour la cause.
On a juste Ó trouver un autre moyen
de le faire. D'accord ?
Attention. T'as arrĻtķ
le retardateur ?
- Non, j'ai rien fait.
- Donne.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Ce qu'il faut faire.
T'as deux minutes.
Non, Porrick... Putain !
Cyril, barre-toi !
McManus !
McManus, Murphy,
il a une bombe !
LÓ-bas en bas.
Conley a une bombe !
Il a une bombe !
Ce putain de Conley
a une bombe !
Vous avez exactement
une minute,
30 secondes
pour ķvacuer Em City !
Porrick, pose la bombe.
On va parler.
- Une minute, 15.
- Putain !
Vous. Vous.
Vķrifiez la salle des ordinateurs.
Vous trois, vķrifiez
toutes les cellules.
Ouvrez la barriĶre.
Eh, Porrick, Porrick !
Coupe les fils.
Y'a pas de retour en arriĶre.
Moins d'une minute. Pars.
Non, pose-la et on part
tous les deux.
Une armķe ķtrangĶre occupe
toujours les rues irlandaises.
Bonne raison pour rester en vie,
tu te souviens ? Pour te battre ?
Je sais ce qui m'attend
en Angleterre.
Je ne mourrai pas
sur leur territoire.
C'est ici que je vais finir.
- O'Reily ! Allez, on y va !
- 20 secondes !
- Ryan !
- Bon sang, Porrick !
10 secondes !
Sainte Marie, pleine de grŌce,
le Seigneur...
Vous Ļtes bķnie entre toutes
les femmes, et Jķsus, le fruit de vos...
Sainte Marie, MĶre de Dieu,
priez pour nous,
maintenant et Ó l'heure
de notre mort. Amen.
Oh, Dieu tout puissant.
Combien de temps
avant la dķtonation ?
Elle aurait dķjÓ
d¹ exploser.
Putain de merde !
Elle a pas explosķ.
- Elle a putain de pas explosķ.
- Attrapez-le.
Nos derniers mots comptent peut-Ļtre
moins que ce que l'on dit sur nous.
A votre mort quelle est la plus belle
chose qu'on dira sur vous ?
Quelle est la pire ?
Quelque part entre les deux,
c'est qui vous Ļtes.
Ou peut-Ļtre que de simples mots
ne suffisent pas Ó dķfinir une vie.
Peut-Ļtre que seuls
nos actes le peuvent.
Oz. C'est ainsi
qu'on appelle couramment
l'établissement pénitentiaire
d'état d'Oswald haute sécurité.
Oz est peuplé d'assassins, de violeurs,
de racistes, de revendeurs de drogue,
mêlés aux criminels
les plus ordinaires.
Mais qu'est-ce qui rend
un homme ordinaire ?
Mieux encore, qu'est-ce qui
le rend unique ?
Gagner des guerres,
gagner des prix ? Non.
Ce qui distingue
un homme de l'ordinaire,
c'est qui il aime...
et par qui il est aimé.
Notre grand état peut
une fois de plus être fier.
Nos établissements pénitentiaires
sont meilleurs
et plus modernes que nulle part
ailleurs dans ce pays.
Faisons savoir
à qui veut l'entendre
que nous n'économiserons
ni argent
ni temps, ni efforts
pour enfermer et punir
la vermine de notre société.
Votre attention, s'il vous plait !
Bienvenue à tous à la paroisse
de Notre Dame de Fatima.
Je sais qu'en raison
des travaux récents
dus à l'explosion de gaz,
les visites à Oz ont été
très limitées
et que pour beaucoup
d'entre vous,
ceci sera la première
visite à vos familles.
A l'appel de votre nom,
alignez-vous ici.
Nous retournons
à Em City en file.
Vous le savez, c'est aussi le premier
jour de visites depuis des mois.
Beaucoup d'entre vous
sont impatients,
alors plus vite vous suivrez
les instructions,
plus vite vous verrez
vos familles.
Faites l'appel.
Numéro 968214,

Bonjour, Carrie.
Ça va ?
- Comment va Jewel ?
- Bien, merci.
- Eugenia Hill ?
- Ça va, mon Père ?
Bien, Mme Hill.
Et vous ?
Ravie de voir mon fils.
C'était bien trop long.
Bien sûr.
Sonsyrea Arif ?
- Bienvenue.
- Salaam aleikum.
- Annette Osorio ?
- Ici.
J'arrive.
J'arrive.
Vous êtes mignon.
Allez.
- Mon Dieu.
- Ouah !
Cool, cool.
- Joli.
- Chouette.
Oh, la vache !
Ouah, regarde ça.
C'est plus grand,
mais pas forcément mieux.
- J'aime la nouvelle couleur.
- C'est la même.
- Je regrette comment c'était avant.
- Dis pas de bêtises.
Bon, l'agent Murphy
va vous attribuer vos cellules.
- J'en veux une avec une belle vue.
- Et une femme de chambre.
Numéro 968214, Adams, Phillip,
cellule numéro six.
Dans l'histoire,
beaucoup de gens célèbres
ont rejoint les mauvais
en prison.
Des êtres humains
de caractère noble
qui pour quelque raison
se sont retrouvés hors la loi.
Prenez... Thomas Paine.
On l'a arrêté pour trahison
et incitation à la révolte.
Pourtant, sans
ses écrits enflammés,
l'Amérique aurait pu
ne jamais être libre.
Ou Thomas Moore.
Homme d'état,
érudit et saint
qui fut envoyé
à la Tour de Londres
pour avoir été honnête
avec son roi.
Sa récompense fut
d'être décapité.
Au secours ! A moi !
A moi ! Au secours !
Au secours !
"Et Samson leur répliqua :
'Cette fois-ci,
je ne serai quitte
envers les Philistins
qu'en leur faisant du mal'"'.
Mes amis, il arrive que
nous soyons coupables
de nos actes
et devrions être punis
en conséquence.
Mais parfois, quelle que soit
la cruauté de nos actes,
nous n'en portons
pas la responsabilité,
car nous avons
puni le coupable.
Amen.
Et maintenant prions.
Seigneur,
nous te prions
pour le rétablissement
du Révérend Jeremiah Cloutier,
qui a survécu
à l'explosion de gaz...
qui l'a libéré
du mur derrière lequel
il était enfermé.
Seigneur, bénis
aujourd'hui son voyage
de retour à Oz
depuis le service des brûlés
de l'hôpital Benchley Memorial.
Seigneur, bénis
aussi Jaz Hoyt...
qui s'est déclaré coupable
d'avoir emmuré le révérend.
Jaz est un homme bon,
Seigneur,
qui souffre inutilement
en isolement.
Veille sur lui, Seigneur,
et préserve sa force.
Gloria, Cloutier est arrivé ?
- Ouais.
- Faut que j'le voie.
Hoyt était
en charge du mur.
Il est en isolement mais refuse
de nommer ses complices.
Il faut que Cloutier me parle.
Impossible. Sa gorge
a été atteinte par le feu.
Il peut à peine
émettre un son.
- Il est conscient ?
- Parfois.
Alors il peut faire signe de la tête
si je donne des noms.
- Où est-il ?
- Dans la chambre privée.
Tim, attendez.
L'explosion l'a sévèrement brûlé.
C'est un miracle
qu'il ait survécu.
Alléluia.
Je veux juste
vous préparer.
T'attends de la visite
aujourd'hui ?
- Ouais, ma sœur Annette.
- Chouette.
C'est une fille super.
Je l'adore.
Elle a toujours
été là pour moi.
Elle est aussi
un peu timbrée.
- Z'avez du feu ?
- C'est interdit de fumer.
Poussez-vous.
J'veux m'asseoir.
J'espère que vous m'excusez
d'avoir flirté avec vous
en montant
dans le bus.
Non, c'est juste...
Je sais que les prêtres
ne s'intéressent pas aux filles.
- A vrai dire...
- Oh, non, pardon.
C'est pas
ce que j'voulais dire...
Vous jurez devant Dieu
de vous abstenir.
- Oui, mais...
- Vous connaissez mon frère ?
Il vient à la messe
tous les dimanches.
Enrique ?
A la messe ?
Nom de Dieu,
il doit s'ennuyer à mourir.
Oh non,
je suis tellement...
C'est pas ce que
je voulais dire.
J'suis sûre que vos célébrations
sont très gaies.
Mais mon frère n'est pas
du genre à aller à l'église.
J'avoue que
la plupart des types
viennent juste
pour rompre la monotonie.
Je n'ai pas vu Enrique
depuis trois ans.
J'étais à South Beach.
Que faisiez-vous là-bas ?
Serveuse dans un bar.
J'ai essayé d'être mannequin
puisque je suis bien faite,
mais j'étais pas prête
à jouer le jeu.
Vous me suivez ?
Ouais, je crois.
Les types essaient
d'abuser de vous ?
Exactement, c'est pourquoi
faut que j'parle à Enrique.
Parce que y'en a un
qui a trop abusé.
Mon putain de mari.
Il vous a fait du mal ?
J'aimais cet enculé de Cubain
de tout mon cœur
et il m'a taillé un bifteck.
Faut qu'Enrique
parle à Xavier.
Qu'il l'appelle depuis Oz ?
La voix de mon frère
voyage loin.
Pas besoin de téléphone
si vous voyez ce que j'veux dire.
Non, s'il vous plait,
ne m'en dites pas plus.
Vous êtes prêtre.
Vous ne pouvez rien dire.
Seulement s'il s'agit
d'une confession.
Nous sommes dans un bus,
pas dans un confessionnal.
- C'est qu'un détail.
- Annette,
ce que vous voulez faire est mal.
Foutaises !
Regardez mon bras.
J'ai pas dit
que votre mari a bien fait.
Mais ça ne résoudra pas
le problème.
Allez vous faire foutre,
espèce de moralisateur
de mes deux !
Vous ne connaissez
rien à rien.
Et c'est exactement
ce que j'voulais dire.
Écoutez-moi.
A mon ordre,
vous sortirez
de votre cellule
et vous vous mettrez en rang.
Sortez.
- Bien.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Pas un mot.
- Putain de merde.
- Neuf et mieux.
Pas un mot.
Bien. Pendant la reconstruction,
nous avons découvert
des problèmes dans les conduits
d'aération de ce bâtiment.
Nous avons besoin de nettoyer
ceux des cellules d'isolement.
Alors jusqu'à
ce que ce soit fait,
je vous remets tous
avec les autres.
Voilà. Super.
- Pas un mot.
- J'ai pas pipé.
C'est une deuxième chance
pour vous.
Si vous vous tenez bien
pendant les prochains jours,
vous n'aurez pas à retourner
en isolement, compris ?
- Foirez pas cette chance.
- Directeur ?
C'est quoi exactement le problème
des conduits d'aération ?
C'est pas
ton problème, White.
Quel conduit ?
C'est l'air qu'on respire ?
Pas un mot, c'est clair ?
J'ai le droit constitutionnel
de respirer de l'air pur.
- Les conduits...
- Respire donc, mon frère, respire.
- Où tu vas ?
- Voir McManus.
Il est pas là.
En rang.
Bienvenu à la maison, Miguel.
J'ai prié pour que
ce jour arrive.
On a des affaires
à régler, toi et moi.
- Ah ouais ?
- T'as tué mes gars,
Carlo Ricardo
et Jorge Vasquez.
Tu dois payer.
Crachat, sueur, sang.
Quoi ?
Tous des liquides corporels.
Tu sais, produits par le corps.
La pisse et les larmes...
Certains sont volontaires,
d'autres pas tant que ça.
Quand j'étais
dans mon cagibi,
j'avais tout le temps
de penser à mes liquides.
Mes jus, tu vois.
Ma merde.
Putain, t'es cinglé, Alvarez.
C'est ça.
C'est moi, le cinglé.
Tu dis que j'dois payer ?
D'accord, mets ça
sur ma note, OK ?
Qu'est-ce qui
se passe ici, bordel ?
- On prend une douche.
- Tout habillés ?
Contre le mur.
Allez, bougez-vous.
Quoi, moi aussi ?
J'vois que t'es propre.
Enferme ces deux cons
dans leurs cellules.
Guerra dans la cage.
Allez, bougez.
T'as autre chose à dire, Alvarez ?
L'homme est fait
de 80% d'eau.
Eh, Miguel, t'as vraiment
de la chance, connard.
Ouais, c'est pourquoi
on m'appelle
Monsieur Chance.
Tu sais que Guerra
te veut mort.
Je peux t'en débarrasser.
A quelle condition ?
Tuer pour toi ?
C'est fini
ce temps-là, Chica.
Fini depuis longtemps.
Tu vois, j'ai aucun intérêt
à te lécher le cul.
Tu survivras pas en solo.
T'as pas les couilles.
- J'ai pas quoi ?
- Les couilles... cojones, pendejo.
- C'est ce que je dis.
- Ah, les bolitas.
Tu vois ça ?
C'est moi
qui l'ai fait. Ouais.
J'me suis taillé
la face, tu vois ?
J'ai planté Rivera
dans les yeux.
Tu vois ? J'ai coupé
la gorge à Vasquez.
Tu vois ?
Meilleur à la lame
qu'un putain de chirurgien.
J'ai rien à te prouver,
mon frère.
Rien.
Allez, barre-toi, putain !
Eh, Giles.
J'ai pas oublié
que tu m'as planté.
Putain de p'tit enculé.
Ouais !
Ouais !
L'incident avec Giles
m'inquiète, Alvarez.
Si tu veux éviter l'isolement,
faut te tenir à carreau.
Vous et moi, on sait
que j'y retourne
quoi que je fasse.
Glynn me laissera pas
naviguer librement.
Et même si vous l'en convainquiez,
j'suis foutu.
Vous savez ?
J'attire les ennuis
comme un putain d'aimant.
Vous savez ce qu'est
le vif-argent ?
- Vif-argent ? Ouais.
- Ouais.
C'est comme le mercure ?
On fait les miroirs avec.
Les miroirs, ouais.
Les reflets, hein ?
C'est toute cette humeur
changeante, vous voyez ?
C'est tout moi.
C'est moi, McManus.
J'suis une sorte de vif-argent.
Eh, Guerra.
Tu ressembles à
un putain de gorille
que j'ai vu une fois
au zoo du Bronx.
Attends un peu
que je sorte d'ici
et j'me fais
ta putain de peau noire.
Quelqu'un a une banane
pour le singe ?
Omar.
Vous voilà. J'avais hâte
de vous voir.
J'peux m'approcher,
s'il vous plait ?
D'accord. Ouais.
Je sais que je m'excuse
tout le temps
pour toutes les bêtises
que je fais.
- Les coups de pied, de couteau.
- Quoi ?
Quand les gardes-chiourmes
m'ont dit que je revenais ici,
j'ai dit : "McManus
est un bon !
Ouais, il a un cœur
gros comme..."
- Je sais pas ce qui est aussi gros.
- Bon.
- Attendez, je sais ce que je dis.
- Me touche pas.
Même si c'est pas
les bons mots,
j'vais me rattraper
cette fois, promis.
Je suis content que tu veuilles
encore faire un effort,
mais faut que
j'te demande.
Pourquoi une telle colère, bordel ?
Pourquoi les coups
de pied à la tête ?
Ben, je suis là à
regarder la télé, hein ?
Et vous apparaissez,
gros comme ça.
Et ce putain de Guerra
commence à se moquer.
- C'est là que la bagarre...
- Je sais.
Pourquoi tu m'as attaqué ?
Parce que vous m'avez rien dit.
Sur quoi ?
Passer à la putain de télé.
Je crois savoir.
Moi qui croyais
qu'on devenait copains.
On échangeait
nos pensées, nos sentiments.
Puis je vous découvre
à la télé
en même temps que
tous ces autres enculés.
D'ailleurs, euh...
vous me devez des excuses.
Moi, te présenter
des excuses ?
Au travail.
Va au travail, Omar.
Tiens, Burr,
chaud et savoureux.
- Comme tu l'aimes.
- C'est sympa.
- Idiots de putain de métèques.
- T'inquiète pas.
T'auras ta chance de tabasser
Chico Guerra tôt ou tard.
Justement.
J'suis fatigué.
J'veux plus
tabasser personne.
J'essaie vraiment fort.
J'essaie de rester
dans le droit chemin.
D'être réglo, tu vois ?
Eh, mangeur de tamales,
ferme donc
ta putain de gueule.
Quoi ?
Guerra n'est pas
un gorille comme toi.
T'approche pas de moi,
pute noire, enculé.
J'vais te faire ta putain de peau !
T'approche plus, pute.
Tu parlais de banane ?
Il y a très longtemps,
des explorateurs allaient découvrir
de nouveaux mondes en bateau.
Des aventuriers comme
Marco Polo et Christophe Colomb
naviguaient vers l'horizon,
ignorant s'ils allaient
arriver quelque part
ou s'ils tomberaient
de la terre.
Leurs voyages amenèrent
à Polo et Colomb
célébrité, fortune
et un boulet au pied.
C'est ça. Celui
qui a découvert l'Amérique
était un escroc, arrêté
pour détournement de fonds.
Après quelques mois
au donjon froid, humide et sale,
je parie que
le vieux Chris regrettait
de ne pas être tombé
de la terre.
Merci, mon Père.
- Elle rit sans arrêt.
- Contente de voir son grand-père.
On a fait la prise de sang.
Hank était bien le père.
- Je sais.
- Ouais.
J'veux juste que M. Schillinger
soit là pour Jewel.
On n'a personne d'autre.
- Et vos parents ?
- Ils sont dans le Montana.
Ils ont rien à foute
de Jewel et moi.
Peut-être
avec le temps, Carrie.
Peut-être.
- C'est les jeux vidéo.
- Pardon ?
Hank y jouait jour et nuit.
Les jeux vidéo et les films.
Il a regardé "Tueurs Nés"
environ 60 fois.
Sans ça, il serait peut-être
encore en vie.
C'est pas
si simple que ça.
Comment il a été élevé,
sa famille, son éducation,
tout a beaucoup contribué
à faire de lui ce qu'il était.
Pouvez-vous la bénir,
mon Père ?
Enlever la malédiction
qu'elle a sur elle ?
Malédiction ?
Celle qui a tué
Hank et son frère.
Et qui a envoyé
M. Schillinger à Oz.
Je veux juste
qu'elle soit heureuse.
Qu'elle ait
une vie heureuse.
Bien. Je vais
faire une prière.
J'ai hâte de voir
ma petite fille.
Bon Dieu, tu vas
encore sortir les violons ?
A la bouffe, les boys.
Qui t'appelle "boy" ?
Pardon, je sais que t'as
du mal à te remettre
et j'veux rien dire
qui fasse péter tes coutures.
Eh, t'as servi
tout le reste de la prison
et tu nous as apporté
la merde qui restait ?
Robson, après
tout ce temps à Oz,
tu veux faire l'expert
gastronomique ?
Oh, tu m'fais peur.
Faut qu'on retourne avec les autres
ou j'vais péter un plomb.
D'après le Dr Nathan,
on se remet bien.
Faut dégommer Said.
Il va regretter
de nous avoir plantés.
Les musulmans ont
ce qu'ils appellent un djihad,
une guerre sainte.
Ils vont avoir une guerre
comme ils n'en ont jamais vu.
Djihad ?
Tu veux aller au trou ?
Pouvez pas m'y mettre.
J'suis convalescent.
Putain de services médicaux.
Merci.
Said.
Le directeur a décidé de t'accuser
de tentative de meurtre
pour avoir poignardé
Robson et Schillinger.
Tu veux un avocat
de l'assistance judiciaire ?
Non.
- Tu veux te défendre toi-même ?
- Non.
J'ai l'intention
de plaider coupable.
Said est d'humeur
triste et sombre.
Comme tout le monde à Oz.
Depuis qu'il a tué
Adebisi, je l'ai vu
devenir de plus
en plus violent.
Cette histoire
avec Robson et Schillinger
est juste un élément de plus
de son long déclin.
Il défendait
Tobias Beecher.
Je ne discute pas ses raisons,
Pete, juste ses méthodes.
L'ancien Said n'aurait jamais
eu recours à la violence,
tout du moins
pas en premier lieu.
Robson et Schillinger
sortent aujourd'hui.
- Oh, super.
- Vous ne pouvez pas prolonger ?
Ils sont guéris.
J'ai besoin des lits.
Donnez-leur du Valium,
du Prozac, des calmants.
- Et pourquoi pas traiter tout le monde ?
- Ça me va.
Écoutez, j'vais pas
me faire emmerder
par les aryens
ou les musulmans.
J'ai l'intention
de le leur dire.
Je veux tout le monde
à la cafétéria à 15h00.
Tu veux pas
ton courrier, Kareem ?
Eh, Tobias. Comment
trouvez-vous le bureau ?
Très chouette.
- Ouais.
- Ils ont enfin amélioré mon ordinateur.
J'ai 128 méga-octets de RAM.
- Comment va Said ?
- Il a l'air bien.
Certains employés
sont inquiets
à propos des musulmans
et des aryens.
A juste titre.
Ce matin dans la douche,
j'ai pensé...
à vous.
Vous pensiez à moi,
nue sous la douche ?
Oh, bon sang.
Said et vous êtes amis.
Et vous vous entendiez
avec Schillinger,
jusqu'à ce qu'il ait vent
de votre liberté conditionnelle.
Et si je pouvais organiser
une interaction
entre Schillinger,
Said et vous ?
Si vous les aidez
à faire la paix,
vous sauverez
beaucoup de vies.
Et quand votre
liberté conditionnelle
sera réexaminée
à la fin de l'année...
Ça fera encore mieux.
Ouais.
Imaginez un peu.
Said, Schillinger et moi
en ménage à trois.
Non, absolument pas.
- Je n'approcherai pas Said.
- Vern...
Mes semblables
ne fréquentent pas son genre.
Vous l'avez bien fait autrefois.
Il a assuré votre défense
dans votre procès
pour complot de meurtre.
- C'était différent.
- Comment ça ?
Il ne m'avait
pas encore planté.
C'est exactement pour ça
qu'il faut vous asseoir ensemble
et qu'il faut que
Tobias Beecher soit là.
Vern,
vous vous souvenez
quand vous êtes venu me voir
pour trouver un sens
à votre vie
afin de trouver la paix,
le bonheur ?
C'est la même chose.
Vous pourrez exprimer
tout ce que
vous ressentez vraiment.
Ce que je ressens...
c'est de la rage.
Mais vous savez bien
que la rage n'apporte pas
de réconfort.
La rage se nourrit de l'âme
jusqu'à ce qu'il
n'y ait plus d'âme.
Je demande à voir.
- Beecher, je demande à voir.
- Hein ?
Tu veux jouer
aux cartes ou pas ?
- Sans moi.
- Bien.
- A moi de distribuer, hein ?
- Oui.
Il se passe
quelque chose, Tobias ?
On est à Oz, Bob.
Il se passe toujours quelque chose.
- 216.
- 216 quoi ?
Jours jusqu'à ma prochaine évaluation
pour liberté conditionnelle.
Deux pairs.
Beecher.
Je mise deux.
Avec ou sans toi ?
Avec.
Oh bien, euh...
Asseyez-vous, messieurs.
Asseyez-vous.
Asseyez-vous.
Je vous ai tous
parlé individuellement
pour vous expliquer ce que j'espère
que nous pouvons réaliser.
Je sais que vous êtes
très sceptiques
alors je vous suis
reconnaissante d'essayer.
Il faut préférer
la vie à la mort.
C'est toi qui m'as planté
dans le dos.
Allons. Vous connaissez la règle.
Chacun de vous
aura la parole.
Je veux d'abord
entendre Tobias.
Bon...
Je me sens
quelque peu responsable
de ce qui s'est passé
dans la bibliothèque ce jour-là.
Tu étais heureux qu'on m'ait refusé
la liberté conditionnelle.
Vues toutes les merdes qu'il y a eu
entre nous, je peux le comprendre.
Et tu l'as vu me menacer
avec Robson,
et tu voulais m'aider.
Ça aussi, je peux l'apprécier.
Alors...
Vous aviez tous les deux
de bonnes raisons...
pour votre façon d'agir.
- Question.
- Allez-y.
Beecher, j'aurais eu
de bonnes raisons de planter Said ?
Je l'aurais pas cherché.
Kareem.
Tu veux dire,
si la situation était inverse
et que Said me menaçait ?
Oui, tu aurais des raisons
de le poignarder.
Foutaises.
Voilà pourquoi,
et vous allez vouloir
m'envoyer à l'asile
quand vous l'entendrez.
Vous êtes semblables.
- Quoi ?
- Tu es fou.
Écoutez-le.
Vous êtes tous les deux
des hommes puissants.
Pas juste
des dirigeants nés,
mais chacun avec
une vue du monde.
Et bien que ces vues soient
complètement opposées,
elles ont des choses
en commun.
Par exemple ?
La croyance
en vos semblables,
en leurs droits,
et les dons
qui leur sont dus.
Vous croyez tous les deux
qu'ils méritent une pleine vie,
le bonheur,
la sécurité
et...
Je sais pas, je...
Je crois que c'est tout
ce que j'ai à dire.
C'est bon.
C'est... assez pour aujourd'hui.
Nous devrions réfléchir
à ce que Tobias a dit
et revenir demain.
Garde.
Violeurs, pédophiles,
hommes prostitués.
Nous avons de tout à Oz.
Des hommes qui ont fait
du sexe un crime.
Et pour ça, ils appartiennent
au plus profond de notre enfer.
Mais nous le savons, le sexe
n'est pas nécessairement amour
et parfois
l'amour lui-même
vous fera emprisonner.
Comme Oscar Wilde.
Celui-ci a aimé
et a perdu
deux années de sa vie
à la prison de Redding.
Deux lèvres, peut-être
un peu de langue,
pressées contre
deux autres lèvres.
Un simple baiser
peut être plus meurtrier
qu'un pistolet.
La dépendance
est l'outil de Satan.
Son système diabolique
pour asservir l'homme.
Il fournit la drogue
à nos hommes et femmes
et les arrête pour en user.
Il emprisonne nos fils
et nos filles
et s'en va avec le sourire
sur son visage blanc.
Mme Arif ?
Je suis désolé...
Certains passagers
m'ont demandé
de vous demander
de baisser d'un ton.
Pourquoi ? Parce qu'ils
ne veulent pas entendre la vérité ?
Dans ce pays,
on traite la drogue
de façon excessive,
oppressive et raciste.
- Peut-être...
- On emprisonne les jeunes noirs
au lieu de les soigner
pour leur abus de substances.
Ce serait moins cher
et plus efficace.
- D'accord, mais c'est pas le moment.
- Quand alors ?
Savez-vous que le nombre
de détenus en Amérique
a plus que triplé
en 20 ans ?
- Oui.
- Savez-vous
qu'en continuant
à ce rythme,
en 2053 il y aura
plus de gens
en prison qu'en liberté
aux États-Unis ?
Alors dites-moi,
allons-nous attendre longtemps
pour changer ça ?
Son bébé essaie de dormir.
Votre mari est drogué ?
Il l'était, jusqu'à ce
qu'il trouve Allah.
Mon fils Augustus aussi.
70% des gens arrêtés testent
positif pour la drogue.
- Mme Arif...
- Sonsyrea.
Sonsyrea...
Vous avez la tête pleine
de faits et chiffres.
Mais des faits froids et durs
ne sont jamais aussi bons
que la simple vérité.
Votre mari, vous a-t-il fait du mal
à vous et vos enfants
quand il était drogué ?
Ouais. Il s'est mis à voler.
- Et maintenant ?
- Il a lutté encore et encore
et il a combattu
ses besoins.
Avec l'aide d'Allah,
il est clean.
- Et vos enfants ?
- Leur père leur manque.
- Mais ils ont Allah maintenant.
- Alors, ma fille,
c'est cette histoire
que vous devriez raconter.
C'est ça que les gens
ont besoin d'entendre.
- T'es de bonne humeur aujourd'hui.
- Ouais, ma femme vient me voir.
Super. Elle amène
les enfants ?
Non, on a besoin de temps seuls,
Sonsyrea et moi.
O'Reily. Ce type
est un animal.
Il a tué Patrick Keenan
tellement violemment,
j'ignore comment
il vit avec lui-même.
Ça va, Busmilla ?
Mange, Arif. Et circule.
Remplace-moi une seconde.
Où tu vas, putain ?
- Eh, eh, eh.
- Relax, O'Reily.
J'ai pas vu ton frère
depuis sa sortie
de protection.
On discute seulement.
Ne l'approche pas.
Mais Ryan,
j'aime bien Henry.
- C'est une ordure.
- T'es bien placé pour le savoir.
T'es en mission kamikaze,
Stanton ?
Si je te vois encore parler à Cyril,
tu descends en flammes.
A plus.
- Qu'est-ce que tu lui as dit ?
- Rien.
Rien.
- Bon Dieu !
- Eh, branleurs.
On travaille ici.
Vous voulez vous joindre à nous ?
L'idée de vous dire
que j'avais vu
Ryan O'Reily tuer Patrick Keenan
m'a beaucoup tourmenté.
Said m'a convaincu
de le faire, et pourtant,
on n'a pas
accusé O'Reily.
Je n'ai pas pu
rassembler de preuves
concrètes contre lui.
Tout ce que j'ai,
c'est ton témoignage
et tu ne veux pas
parler publiquement.
Ou bien as-tu changé d'avis ?
Si je le fais,
O'Reily me fera tuer.
Ne t'attends pas
à des miracles.
J'ai revu ce moment
dans ma tête,
en détail, et c'est peut-être
pas important,
mais je crois qu'il a arraché
un trèfle du cou de Keenan.
- Un trèfle ?
- Ouais, en or, au bout d'une chaîne.
- Je vois.
- Laissez pas tomber.
La justice doit être faite.
O'Reily doit être puni.
- N'approchez pas.
- Mais j'ai mal.
- Où ?
- Au cœur.
Parce que vous m'ignorez.
Je suis occupée, Ryan.
Je voulais savoir
si le Conseil des Médecins
s'était prononcé sur votre affaire
de faute professionnelle ?
Oui.
Ils m'ont donné un blâme
et une amende,
mais je suis encore médecin.
Bien c'est...
c'est super, non ?
Gloria ?
- Je peux vous voir ?
- Bien sûr.
Allons faire un tour.
Celui qui a tué
Patrick Keenan
a pris une chaîne en or
à son cou, un trèfle.
Quand nous parlions,
à un moment,
vous aviez un trèfle
dans la main.
- C'était le sien.
- Où l'avez-vous eu ?
Je l'ai reçu à mon bureau
dans une enveloppe vierge.
Quand je vous ai interrogée
sur le meurtre,
pourquoi ne pas
me l'avoir dit ?
Leo, on m'a violée.
Après un tel traumatisme,
on n'a pas les idées claires.
J'ai fait des choses qui n'ont pas
de sens depuis ça.
Dès que je crois
me contrôler,
la moindre chose
me fait déraper.
Je sais.
Et je suis désolé.
Honnêtement, quelque part je suis
heureuse que Keenan soit mort.
Je veux juste
oublier son visage.
Bien entendu.
Euh, Gloria...
Une dernière question
et c'est promis,
je n'en parlerai
plus jamais.
Où est le collier ?
Tenez.
J'ai balancé
ce putain de truc.
Allons, il doit
y avoir une limite
au nombre de fois où vous pouvez
me poser les mêmes questions.
Tu crois que je viole
tes droits civils ?
Tu veux consulter
un avocat ?
Pas besoin d'avocat,
j'ai pas tué Keenan.
Écoutez, regardez
les fiches de travail.
J'ai pas approché
la gym de la journée.
- C'est pas ce que dit mon informateur.
- Il ment.
Pourquoi mentirait-il ?
Écoutez, beaucoup de gens
m'en veulent.
Beaucoup en voulaient
à Keenan.
Ce tueur semait la pagaille,
toujours dans des bagarres.
Consultez les dossiers, vous trouverez
un paquet de suspects.
Je l'ai déjà fait.
Mais t'es toujours favori.
Emmenez-le.
Glynn veut te coller
le meurtre de Keenan ?
Il a un témoin,
mais je sais pas qui. Sinon,
j'pourrais persuader cet enculé
de changer son témoignage ou...
- Le tuer ?
- Ouais, ben,
en tout cas,
faut brouiller les pistes.
Ouais, mais comment ?
Cet article...
faut qu'il se retrouve
dans le casier de Henry Stanton
enfoui sous
ses sous-vêtements.
En attendant,
tu vas faire quoi ?
Encourager un témoin tout à fait
différent à se manifester.
Allez, Marty, allez.
- Allez ! Allez !
- Vas-y.
Ouais, baby.
- Hors zone.
- Tu déconnes ?
Hors zone !
Détenu numéro 99M633 :
Martin Montgomery ;
condamné le 16 mars 1999 ;
deux accusations
de coups et blessures.
Condamné à
huit ans de prison
dont cinq fermes.
Eh, Marty, mon pote.
- Un autre morceau de gâteau ?
- Bien sûr. Merci.
- O'Reily, c'est ça ?
- C'est ça.
Pourquoi tu m'offres
du rabe de gâteau ?
Trois ans ici et t'as jamais même
pété dans ma direction.
T'as raison.
On est pas amis.
Tout le monde le sait,
c'est pourquoi je peux t'offrir
- une bonne opportunité lucrative.
- Comme quoi ?
J'veux que t'ailles
dire au directeur
que t'as vu Henry Stanton
tuer Keenan.
Mais c'est faux.
Y'a encore beaucoup de gâteau.
Stanton a frappé Keenan
avec une barre d'haltères
à peu près là.
Keenan s'est écroulé. Stanton
lui a arraché sa chaîne du cou.
- Et ensuite ?
- Je me suis sauvé.
J'allais pas rester là !
Bien, merci
d'être venu me voir.
Je vous l'ai dit, je pouvais pas,
en toute conscience,
garder ça pour moi.
Ben ça alors !
D'habitude, personne ne cafte,
et maintenant j'ai
deux témoins différents
identifiant deux suspects différents
pour le même meurtre.
Montgomery avait plus
de détails qu'Arif. Et précis.
Ouais, et selon les rapports,
Stanton et Keenan
se battaient sans arrêt.
- Mais pourquoi Arif mentirait-il ?
- Demandez-le lui.
Non, j'vais d'abord parler
à Henry Stanton.
Moi ?
Tuer Patrick Keenan ?
- Si seulement.
- Au moins deux fois, au quartier B,
Keenan t'a tabassé.
C'est pas vrai.
Je l'ai frappé aussi.
D'après le rapport médical,
après la première bagarre,
tu avais deux côtes cassées,
à la seconde,
un poignet cassé.
Keenan n'avait
aucune blessure.
Ma victoire était morale.
Ce jour-là à la gym,
tu l'as buté, n'est-ce pas ?
Non.
Je le jure sur la tête
de mes enfants.
On a trouvé ça
dans ta cellule.
C'est la première fois
que je vois ça.
Tu fais une fixation
sur le Dr Nathan ?
Non. Elle a de beaux
nichons et tout ça,
- mais j'ai jamais même...
- Emmenez-le au trou.
- Au trou ? Pourquoi ?
- Quelques jours là-bas
vont te remettre
la cervelle en place.
Va te faire enculer !
Va te faire foutre !
Va te faire enculer, enfoiré.
Directeur, comment
progresse l'enquête ?
- Bien.
- Quand allez-vous arrêter O'Reily ?
Dis-moi une chose, Arif.
Pourquoi veux-tu à tout prix
qu'O'Reily soit accusé ?
Je vous l'ai dit,
il faut que justice se fasse.
Pas d'autre raison,
pas d'autre motif ?
- Non.
- C'est pas une vengeance
- pour quelque chose qu'il t'a faite ?
- Non.
J'ai fait des recherches.
Pendant les émeutes,
- vous avez failli vous battre.
- Les émeutes ?
Ça fait cinq ans.
D'après mon expérience,
les détenus ont bonne mémoire.
Vous croyez que j'ai inventé
cette histoire ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Je n'en sais rien.
Et je suis pas sûr d'en avoir
quelque chose à faire.
Écoute ça.
Glynn a suspendu
l'enquête sur le meurtre
de Patrick Keenan.
Trop de suspects,
pas assez d'indices.
- Parfait.
- Tu pourrais aller plus loin.
Tu pourrais
faire condamner Stanton.
- J'veux pas.
- Pourquoi ?
Écoute.
Si Stanton est condamné à mort
pour ce meurtre,
Gloria ne laissera pas
mourir un innocent.
Elle se sentira obligée
de dire la vérité.
Non, je gagne en gardant
la balle dans le jeu,
en gardant
les faits obscurs.
Fais mettre ça
chez Montgomery.
Montgomery ?
- Pourquoi lui ?
- Assurance vie.
Ryan, j'peux dire
notre secret à Henry ?
Qu'on a roulé
le directeur ?
Non. Bon sang,
ne lui dis pas
un putain de mot.
Arrête de crier.
Pourquoi tu cries tout le temps ?
Comme Papa.
Barre-toi.
Galilée a remis
en question l'idée
acceptée pendant
plus de 1 000 ans
que la terre était
le centre de l'univers.
Que tout tournait
autour de nous.
Les moines de l'Inquisition
emprisonnèrent Galilée
et lui ordonnèrent de nier
sa théorie. Ce qu'il fit.
Y a-t-il pire punition
que d'être forcé à renier publiquement
ses convictions les plus profondes ?
Dire que la vérité
est un mensonge ?
Je vois ce bébé
et je pense
à Augustus quand
il venait de naître.
Quand il a fait
ses premiers pas.
On y repense en disant
si j'avais fait ça,
ou pas ça,
sa vie entière aurait pu
être différente.
- Allah guide chacun de nos pas.
- Je sais.
Dieu est ma force,
mais Il ne peut pas empêcher
ces pensées de m'envahir,
les souvenirs
de revenir à ma mémoire.
Les premières chaussures
d'Augustus,
son premier jour d'école.
Oh, le jour
de son mariage.
Il avait l'air si heureux.
Annabella aussi.
Le soleil brillait tellement
que je devais lorgner
pour les voir partir en voiture.
Et maintenant j'ai l'impression
de l'avoir perdu ce jour-là,
de plus d'une façon.
Son... son monde
s'est rétréci,
vous savez, avec la drogue
et tout ça.
- Il se drogue encore ?
- Oh, non, Dieu merci.
Mon garçon est clean
depuis trois ans.
- Je suis très fière de lui pour ça.
- Oui, bien sûr.
C'est pourquoi
je m'inquiète.
C'est pourquoi aujourd'hui
va être tellement dur.
J'ai... j'ai une nouvelle
à lui annoncer.
Une mauvaise nouvelle.
Je veux qu'il l'entende de moi
parce que si je peux
amortir le choc...
Sa femme, Annabella,
- elle veut le divorce.
- Oh, mince.
J'ai essayé
de lui parler, mais...
elle est décidée.
Elle a un autre type
et maintenant...
elle veut sa liberté.
Et pourtant...
Dieu me vienne en aide,
je ne peux pas m'empêcher
de la blâmer
pour les ténèbres
qui ont envahi la vie d'Augustus.
Elle était avec lui
le soir où il a tiré
sur le policier.
Le soir où sa colonne
a été brisée.
Elle aurait dû prendre
meilleur soin de mon fils.
Eugenia ?
Ça va.
Ça va. Ça va.
Je pleure pour Augustus,
mon petit empereur.
Enfermé dans une cellule,
dans cet endroit misérable...
le corps à moitié mort.
Et bon sang...
je ne fais que penser
à ses premiers pas.
Eh, Burr, pourquoi
tu fais jamais la queue ?
Parce que personne
ne m'envoie rien.
Écoute ça.
Ces enculés veulent
que je contribue au Fond Unitaire
d'Education Supérieure des Noirs.
Ils plaisantent.
Putain.
Une lettre d'un avocat.
Ma femme demande
le divorce.
Et t'es surpris ?
Je suppose
que non. Enfin...
Non, non, elle...
elle vient me voir
de moins en mois,
et quand elle vient,
elle est...
distante, pour sûr.
Qu'est-ce que t'espères ?
Ça fait sept ans
que t'es enfermé ici.
Ça fait long
pour une jeune femme.
Je sais. C'est juste...
tu sais, on s'aimait.
Elle aurait au moins pu
venir me dire au revoir.
C'est pas de chance.
Pas de chance.
Tu vas survivre, mon gars.
T'as survécu dans ce trou à rats,
tu survivras au divorce.
Peut-être.
La perdre...
c'est comme renoncer
à mon dernier espoir.
C'est comme admettre
que tout ce que j'avais à l'extérieur
est parti.
Parti pour toujours.
Tu sais, j'te l'ai
jamais dit, mais...
Dee et moi
on allait divorcer aussi.
- Quoi ?
- Juste avant sa maladie.
Bien sûr, après
j'pouvais pas la laisser.
J'croyais que
vous étiez heureux.
Vous aviez toujours
l'air heureux.
C'était la vodka.
La seule femme
qui pouvait boire plus que moi.
L'amour dans ses yeux
était toujours un peu trouble.
Non, toi et ta mère
étiez la seule
vraie famille
que j'aie connue.
Elle vient aujourd'hui.
Eugenia.
On pourrait peut-être
la voir ensemble.
Tu sais, ça me ferait plaisir.
J'aimerais voir Eugenia.
Elle a toujours eu
les yeux les plus doux.
OK, on devrait être
à l'entrée d'Oswald
dans cinq minutes environ.
Sonsyrea Arif,
Charles Ballace,
Eugenia Hill...
Annette Osorio,
Sharon Patel,
Trudy Granser,
Carrie Schillinger...
Et ma petite fille ?
Jewel Schillinger.
Elle est à l'hôpital
Benchley Memorial.
État stationnaire.
Dee Swanson,
Pamela Turton...
Ouais, ouais, ouais,
beaucoup de gens bien
ont regardé des murs
de prison de l'intérieur.
Socrate, Gandhi,
Jeanne d'Arc,
même notre Seigneur,
Jésus Christ.
Il n'a pas passé sa dernière nuit
avec des hommes saints,
mais avec des rebuts
dans le genre de ceux d'Oz.
L'une des dernières choses
qu'il ait faite sur terre
fut d'inviter un prisonnier
à l'accompagner au paradis.
Il aimait ce criminel.
Je dirais qu'il aimait
ce criminel
autant qu'il aimait
n'importe qui d'autre.
Jésus savait
en son cœur
qu'il faut beaucoup
pour aimer un pécheur.
Mais le pécheur
en a d'autant plus besoin.
Trois sortes de lois
prťvalent.
La premiŤre et la plus
importante, la loi divine,
avec, dans son sillage
la loi de la nature,
et finalement, distancťes,
les lois crťťes par l'homme.
Pour que l'homme puisse
crťer une loi,
il faut qu'un groupe
de personnes dťcide
qu'ils ont dťcouvert
la vťritť absolue,
une vťritť inhťrente,
ŗ laquelle chaque citoyen
doit se plier,
sous peine d'Ítre sanctionnť.
Le problŤme est que le groupe
qui dťtermine cette vťritť absolue
est une bande de politicards.
Si vous aviez le choix,
prťfťreriez-vous Ítre jugť par Dieu,
ou par un vote du Parlement ?
Voilŗ un homme mort.
Quand tu veux, mec.
Plus tard.
Mais je te surveille du coin de l'úil.
T'as jamais eu plus raison.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Je parle du fait que
tu n'as qu'un seul úil,
espŤce d'enculeur de borgnes.
- Fils de pute !
- Vas-y ! Tue-le !
Tue ce fils de pute !
Tue ce putain de bronzť !
Impressionnant...
tout ŗ l'heure, ŗ la cafťtťria.
Comment Áa ?
Balancer des avertissements
ŗ tire-larigot.
Tu crois que Áa va marcher ?
- J'vais m'en sortir ?
- J'en sais rien.
J'suis sŻr que tu sais.
«a fait 36 ans que tu es ŗ Oz.
T'en as vu autant que moi,
si ce n'est plus.
Et je sais que tu connais
toutes les ficelles.
Non, y'a pas de secrets.
C'est quoi alors ?
Je suis restť le mÍme.
Comme je dis toujours, la diffťrence
entre gťnťrations est incroyable.
Vous, les jeunes, vous avez grandi
avec de nombreuses possibilitťs.
C'est trŤs bien, d'une certaine faÁon.
Mais d'un autre cŰtť,
la majoritť d'entre vous
a une crise d'identitť.
A notre ťpoque, c'ťtait plus facile.
Ces "crises d'identitť"
n'existaient pas.
Tu te souciais juste
de ce que tu avais ŗ faire.
A 18, 19 ans, on t'envoyait
faire la guerre.
Voilŗ ce qu'ťtait
ma quÍte d'identitť.
Notre quÍte ŗ tous.
Vous Ítes des hťros, alors ?
C'est ce que tu veux dire ?
Vous Ítes des Superman ?
Bien sŻr que non !
On avait une trouille bleue.
Mais quand on a dťbarquť
sur les plages
et que les portes des barges
se sont abaissťes,
on partait ŗ la charge.
C'ťtait comme Áa,
on n'avait pas le choix.
J'ai ťtť confrontť
ŗ de nombreux obstacles
et ŗ de grands moments
de peur dans ma vie.
Mais Ítre d'une gťnťration
qui est allťe au charbon,
m'a permis de toujours bien
me sentir dans ma peau.
C'est super.
Super.
Oh, Raider !
Putain, cette meuf !
Elle est trop bonne.
Je veux que
tu me poignardes.
Quoi ?
Que tu me plantes.
Je ne me vengerai pas.
Vraiment ?
Tu vas me laisser te tuer ?
Non, pas me tuer.
Me planter dans l'ťpaule.
Voilŗ le deal :
je te laisse me planter tranquille,
et en ťchange,
je ne meurs pas.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Je te laisse faire.
«a te ferait pas du bien
de me planter ?
«a me ferait un putain de bien.
Mais respecte le deal.
Il me faut des tťmoins.
Il m'en faut beaucoup.
Je pige.
Tu me laisses te planter,
et je me ramasse
10 ans d'isolement.
Non.
On le fait quand
il n'y a pas de gardes.
Tu t'en occupes.
Je veux juste que
les autres soient tťmoins,
comme Áa, si tu dťcides de me tuer,
un des prisonniers
ira voir Glynn,
et te balancera.
Tu te retrouves
condamnť ŗ mort.
«a marche.
Ce que ce fils de pute
ne sait pas,
c'est que je vais le tuer.
Une fois qu'il s'ťcroule,
je lui mets un couteau dans la main
et Áa devient
de la lťgitime dťfense.
Putain.
Quoi ?
Depuis le dťcŤs de ma súur
je suis insensible ŗ tout.
Et maintenant que tu me dis
que tu vas tuer Alvarez,
je ressens un truc
dans mes tripes.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Rien.
J'ťtais un dieu pour ma súur.
Tu n'peux pas tuer Alvarez.
- Quoi ?
- J'ai pas versť une larme
pour une súur qui me vťnťrait.
Et pourtant, cette histoire
avec Alvarez me secoue.
C'est pas normal.
Y'a un truc qui va pas.
Et par respect pour Annette,
je ne peux pas ignorer Áa.
Toi non plus.
C'est juste que tu ressens
les choses avec un dťcalage.
T'es en ťtat de choc.
Et dans une semaine,
tu pleureras ta súur comme un bťbť.
Mais on n'a pas une semaine.
Notre seule chance de tuer Alvarez,
c'est de le faire ici, et tout de suite.
Chico.
T'es prÍt ?
PrÍt.
Les gars !
Matez un peu par ici !
Les gars, regardez
un peu par ici !
Ici, oui, ici.
Central, ici 14.
On a un blessť dans le gymnase.
Je rťpŤte, on a un blessť.
Ramenez-vous.
Tiens bon, tiens bon.
On a un blessť dans le gymnase.
Ici 14.
Et voilŗ.
Tu es superbe.
J'aurais bien voulu qu'ils te laissent
assister aux funťrailles.
Moi aussi. Mais je n'ťtais pas
vraiment de la famille.
J'y crois toujours pas.
Comment maman
peut-elle Ítre morte ?
Je me souviens de la premiŤre fois
oý je l'ai rencontrťe.
Aucuns de nous n'avaient
plus de 14 ans.
J'ťtais avec ton pŤre
en train de faire je ne sais quoi,
quand tout ŗ coup,
je l'ai vue traverser
Friedmont Street.
Elle avait des yeux superbes.
Ton pŤre ne l'a repťrťe
que lorsque je lui ai tapť
sur l'ťpaule.
Ils se sont regardťs,
et cela a suffit.
Ils se sont mariťs
et ensuite tu es nť.
Burr.
Tu as toujours aimť ma mŤre,
n'est-ce pas ?
Bien sŻr.
Non.
Je veux dire que
tu ťtais amoureux d'elle.
J'aimais ton pŤre aussi.
Mais c'est la vie.
Je veux que tu dťposes Áa
sur sa tombe.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Ma bague de fin d'ťtudes.
T'as eu des nouvelles
de ta fiancťe
depuis qu'elle t'a plaquť
le jour du mariage ?
A coup sŻr.
"Cours toujours, tu vas m'attraper !"
Non, j'ai regardť ce feuilleton hier,
et Norma est toujours
dans "Miss Sally".
On voit son nom dans le gťnťrique.
Ce sont des anciens ťpisodes.
J'ai lu qu'ils allaient
peut Ítre arrÍter
"Miss Sally's Schoolyard".
Quoi ?
T'es vraiment tarť.
Pas ťtonnant qu'elle se soit cassťe.
Et tu sais ce que c'est, toi ?
De quoi tu parles, enculť ?
Que d'Ítre abandonnť.
Tu n'en as pas
la moindre idťe, imbťcile.
Merci de m'avoir dťfendu.
Mais maintenant,
tu vas avoir des ennuis.
Peu importe.
- C'est quoi, ton problŤme ?
- Mon fils est venu aujourd'hui.
La santť d'Alex s'est empirťe.
Il est atteint d'une leucťmie.
Oh, Bob.
C'est horrible.
Il lui faut absolument
une greffe de moelle osseuse.
- Et tu dois Ítre donneur ?
- Je suis inutile.
Personne dans notre famille n'est
compatible. La mŤre d'Alex
Les antťcťdents gťnťtiques
de mon petit-fils
lui donnent...
une des plus belles peaux
que vous ne verrez jamais,
et diminuent ťgalement ses chances
de trouver un donneur.
Mais il doit y avoir quelqu'un
de compatible quelque part.
Oh oui, quelque part.
Mais il y a une pťnurie de donneurs,
et encore plus pour
ce type de donneurs.
Les docteurs devraient essayer
de mobiliser les gens.
Si seulement Áa pouvait Ítre
aussi facile.
Comme pour beaucoup
d'autres maladies,
il y a un manque d'argent.
Tu vas oý ?
Vois le Dr Nathan.
Je ne me sens pas trŤs bien.
Tout comme la moelle ťpiniŤre,
le cordon ombilicale
renferme des cellules
capables de combattre la leucťmie.
Le problŤme est que cette procťdure
n'en est qu'au titre expťrimental.
Merci.
Et voilŗ.
Prenez Áa.
Vous irez mieux.
Je sais combien
vous vous sentez inutile, Bob.
Une histoire comme celle
de votre petit-fils me bouleverse.
Mon cŰtť latin prend le dessus
et je commence alors ŗ m'en vouloir
d'Ítre tellement amťricaine.
- Je ne vous suis pas, lŗ.
- En Amťrique Centrale,
Amťrique du Sud, il y a une forte
croyance envers certaines herbes
qui soigneraient le cancer
et certaines maladies.
Mais vous pensez que ce ne sont
que des foutaises ?
Comme je vous le disais,
je suis prise dans le systŤme.
Brochures, magazines,
journaux mťdicaux,
tout ce qui traite de
la mťdecine par les plantes,
et particuliŤrement tout ce
qui a rapport avec la leucťmie.
LE JOURNAL DU BIEN ETRE
Guťrir le cancer de faÁons naturelles
Extinction des feux.
NOUVEAUX HORIZONS
DANS L'HOMEOPATHIE
J'ai dťcouvert un traitement
contre le cancer.
- Quoi ?
- Lapacho.
- Lapa quoi ?
- C'est une herbe
qui pousse au Paraguay,
dans la jungle.
Des mťdecins prťtendent l'avoir
utilisťe avec succŤs
dans le traitement du cancer,
et de la leucťmie en particulier.
- C'en est une bonne nouvelle.
- Non, non, pas du tout.
- C'est exaspťrant.
- Exaspťrant ?
Le lapacho est un arbre
ŗ feuillage persistant.
Il y a plus d'une centaine
d'espŤces de lapacho.
Le coŻt pour dťterminer
quelle espŤce
possŤde les vertus mťdicinales,
est exorbitant.
Et voilŗ encore une fois.
L'argent, l'argent, l'argent.
Le seul moyen d'avancer
dans ce monde,
c'est d'Ítre milliardaire.
- Je trouverai l'argent.
- A Oz ? Et comment ?
Je l'ignore, mais
je trouverai un moyen.
Bonne chance.
Voici quelques lois. De vraies lois,
actuellement en vigueur.
Des lois qui vous mŤneront en prison
si vous ne les respectez pas.
Dans l'…tat du Rhode Island,
il est interdit d'asperger les tramways
avec du jus de cornichons.
Dans l'…tat de Washington,
les sucettes sont interdites.
Dans l'Indiana,
on ne peut pas prendre de douche
d'octobre ŗ mars.
A San Francisco, on peut pas utiliser des
confettis qui ont dťjŗ servi.
En Caroline du Nord, les chiens
et les chats ne peuvent pas se battre.
Mais tout cela va ŗ l'encontre
des lois de la nature.
Les chiens et les chats
sont nťs ennemis.
C'est bon, terminť.
Ramenez-le en cellule.
- C'est une blessure ŗ la tÍte.
- Que s'est-il passť ?
J'allais dťtachť ce charlot,
quand il m'a frappť.
- J'suis pas une gonzesse.
- Du coup, j'lui ai fait goŻter de Áa.
Tapette !
Prťparez-le pour les points de suture.
On va vous faire quelques points.
Comment vous appelez-vous ?
Henry Stanton.
Et je ne suis pas amoureux de vous.
- Quoi ?
- Glynn m'a envoyť au trou
parce qu'il dit que je suis obsťdť
par vos seins. Ce qui est faux.
Expliquez au gardien
que je suis innocent.
- D'accord.
- Cassez-vous...
Dites au gardien
que je suis innocent !
L‚chez-moi !
- Stanton !
- Oh, non !
- «a va ?
- Je m'en sortais, Ryan.
- «a ne m'en avait pas l'air.
- Je n'ai pas besoin de toi dans ma vie.
- TrŤs bien.
- Casse-toi !
- D'accord.
- Tu te barres, O'Reily !
Alors ils arrivent
ces points de suture ?
Donnez-moi une autre paire de gants,
et prťparez-le !
Vous pouvez le tenir ?
Et voilŗ, Enrique.
Ryan, mets-moi
des betteraves de cŰtť.
T'as de l'appťtit tout ŗ coup, Marty.
J'en ai jamais assez.
- C'est pour Áa qu'on doit parler.
- De quoi ?
Mon dťdommagement
pour avoir menti ŗ Glynn.
C'est de Áa que je parle.
Pour garder mes lŤvres cousues,
- t'as intťrÍt ŗ allonger les bifetons.
- Allez, Marty.
- On avait un accord.
- Je le renťgocie.
Bon, voilŗ ce qu'on va faire...
On se retrouve
ŗ la bibliothŤque ŗ 16h00 ?
AmŤne ton carnet de chŤques.
J'ai demandť ŗ Montgommery
de mentir ŗ Glynn
en disant que Stanton
avait tuť Keenan.
Et si je le paie pas plus,
Montgommery va me balancer.
S'il fait Áa, Glynn saura
que tu as tuť Keenan.
Tu seras exťcutť.
C'est pour Áa que je vais manquer mon
rancart avec Montgommery ŗ 16h00.
Ah bon ?
Je vais envoyer Stanton ŗ ma place.
Eh, Stanton.
O'Reily, je fous
la paix ŗ tout le monde,
ainsi qu'ŗ Nathan.
Laisse-moi tranquille.
C'est bon, je sais.
Je pense que toi et moi,
on est partis sur
de mauvaises bases.
J'veux juste que tu saches
que je n'ai rien contre toi.
- TrŤs bien.
- En fait, toi et moi
avons quelque chose en commun.
Nous sommes des suspects
dans le meurtre de Keenan.
Je sais.
On a tous les deux des tťmoins
qui certifient nous avoir vus.
J'ignore qui m'accuse,
mais par un coup de bol,
j'ai dťcouvert qui ment ŗ ton sujet.
- Qui c'est ?
- J'hťsite ŗ te le dire,
de crainte que tu ne fasses
quelque chose de stupide.
Un fils de pute qui ment ŗ mon sujet,
Áa me rend cinglť.
- C'est mieux que je ne te le dise pas.
- Dis-le moi !
- Je ne devrais pas.
- Dis-le moi !
- Je t'en prie, dis-le moi.
- Non, je ne te dirai rien.
- Dis-le moi !
- Laisse tomber, je te dis !
- Bordel, dis-le moi !
- Martin Montgommery.
Martin Montgommery ?
J'vais descendre cet enculť !
Je parie que tu ne seras plus
si bavard, fils de pute.
- L‚chez-le !
- Putain !
Je le tiens.
On a une blessure au cou.
Je l'ai. Stanton !
Stanton est en isolement.
Montgommery est ŗ l'hŰpital de Benchley,
dans un ťtat critique.
Des tťmoins dans la salle de sport
vous ont entendu dire ŗ Stanton
que Montgommery l'avait balancť.
Non. Stanton m'a demandť
si je savais quoi que ce soit,
et je lui ai dit que j'avais juste entendu des
rumeurs.
Voilŗ ce qu'on a trouvť dans le casier
de Montgommery.
C'est quoi Áa ?
La feuille de trŤfle de Keenan.
Je la reconnais maintenant.
Qu'est-ce que Montgommery
foutait avec Áa ?
Je pensais que vous me le diriez.
Vous rigolez, j'en sais rien.
Suzanne Fitzgerald, une extrťmiste
des annťes 60 qui s'ťtait rendue
aux autoritťs aprŤs 32 ans de cavale,
a quittť aujourd'hui
- la maison d'arrÍt de Parker.
- Putain !
Le Gouverneur Devlin a transformť
sa sentence en deux annťes
- de travaux d'intťrÍts public.
- Super !
Bien que sans surprise,
cette dťcision suscite
la controverse.
Super !
Allez, Cyril !
Nous sommes ravis que
vous ayez choisi Oz
pour effectuer vos travaux
d'intťrÍt public.
Et votre idťe de crťer un programme
d'arts est excellente.
Merci. J'ai donnť des cours de musique
ŗ St Albans pendant 20 ans.
Alors, quand j'ai appris que vous
n'aviez pas de programme ici,
j'ai pensť que ce serait parfait.
Mais le plus dur va Ítre de convaincre
les gars de s'inscrire.
Je pense qu'ils vont essayer,
juste par curiositť.
Le problŤme sera
de les fidťliser.
Si j'y suis arrivťe
avec des enfants de 10 ans,
Áa devrait aller avec vos prisonniers.
De quoi avez-vous
besoin pour commencer ?
J'aimerais voir l'endroit
oý je vais donner mes cours.
La scŤne est dans la cafťtťria.
Je vous y emmŤne.
- Ensuite je voudrais voir mon fils.
- Bien sŻr.
Ryan !
- Ryan.
- Bonjour.
Je pensais t'avoir perdu
dťfinitivement.
Oh non, mon chťri.
Tu ne te dťbarrasseras pas de moi.
Je sais que ce n'est pas ton fils,
et qu'il n'est que mon demi-frŤre,
mais j'aimerais
te prťsenter Cyril.
- Volontiers.
- Oui ? C'est bon ? Cyril, Cyril ?
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- J'ai fait Áa pour vous.
- Merci.
C'est vraiment gentil.
C'est trŤs beau.
Je peux vous embrasser ?
- Oh oui.
- D'accord.
Vous allez Ítre
mes premiers ťlŤves ?
Maman, tu sais bien
que je ne sais pas chanter.
- Moi non plus.
- Quoi ?
Vous tenez Áa de votre pŤre.
Il avait une voix de sanglier.
- Elle est marrante, hein ?
- Elle est marrante.
Ravie de te l'entendre dire.
Vous allez dire ŗ vos amis
de s'inscrire ?
Nos amis ?
Oh oui, bien sŻr.
C'est bon, j'le ferai.
En fait, on m'a toujours dit
que j'avais une belle voix.
- Vraiment ?
- Vraiment.
Au lycťe, j'ai eu le rŰle principal
dans la comťdie musicale.
Ma mŤre n'a pas besoin de savoir
que tu as dťjŗ chantť, pigť ?
- Pas de problŤme.
- Super.
Elle est bonne ta reum, O'Reily.
Elle nique ?
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
- Va te faire enculer !
- J'vais te crever !
- Ferme-la !
- Casse-toi, enculť !
- Vas-y, Hoyt !
- Va te faire foutre !
Lentement, maintenant
tu te dťroules.
Doucement, tout doucement.
Attends, Matt.
Attends. OK.
Dťcontracte ta m‚choire,
et tes ťpaules.
Tes bras.
- Faut qu'on parle.
- Je suis occupťe.
C'est bon, j'ai des trucs ŗ faire.
A jeudi, alors ?
Sans problŤme.
- Viens lŗ, viens.
- Quoi ?
- Faut que tu dťmissionnes.
- Quoi ?
- …coute...
- C'est mon premier jour !
J'ai eu des problŤmes
avec plein de mecs.
- Tu pourrais avoir des problŤmes.
- Des problŤmes ?
- Ouais.
- Il y a un garde, juste lŗ.
Ils ne sont pas fiables.
«a ne m'inquiŤte pas.
- Moi, je m'inquiŤte.
- C'est gentil, mais...
J'essaie pas d'Ítre gentil, d'accord ?
Tu pourrais avoir de graves ennuis.
Ryan, je sais ce que je fais,
et j'assume mes responsabilitťs.
On a besoin de moi, ici.
C'est mon ťlťment.
Et tu ne me feras pas
changer d'avis.
O'Reily, tu bosses
aujourd'hui, ou pas ?
- Vas-y.
- Mais, maman...
- Vas-y.
- Tu te bouges le cul, O'Reily ?
Y'a que nous qui bossons, ducon ?
Putain !
Dave...
tu es de retour.
- Oui.
- Comment Áa va ?
Pas mal.
Je voulais passer te voir
ŗ l'hŰpital, mais...
Pas de problŤme.
Alors, Áa va ?
Je te l'ai dťjŗ demandť, n'est-ce pas ?
Tout va bien, c'est sŻr ?
Je travaille.
Tu vas rester ŗ Oz ?
J'suis pas certain.
Le directeur de la prison
m'a donnť ce poste,
et je vais devoir considťrer
mon avenir.
Je suis vraiment dťsolť
que cela soit arrivť.
Et tu ne sais toujours pas
qui m'a plantť ?
Non.
Pour Ítre honnÍte,
c'est pour Áa que je suis ici.
Je veux savoir.
J'en crŤve de savoir.
Je t'assure, tu peux pas savoir
comment je vais le niquer.
Quelqu'un t'a agressť
pour que tu ne puisses pas
participer ŗ la finale de basket.
- Comment Áa ?
- AprŤs qu'on ait dťcidť de ne pas jouer
j'ai dit ŗ Morales que tu jouerais.
Je suis sincŤrement dťsolť.
Je vais t'ouvrir.
Putain de bordel !
Tim, le directeur
m'a demandť de te dire
que nous avons
une rťunion ŗ 11h00.
- Y'a un truc urgent ?
- On a la visite du Gouverneur Devlin.
Super !
- A 11h00 prťcises. Pas de retard !
- Ouais, ouais.
Bien que le Prťfet Douglas
fasse un travail fantastique,
il existe un rťel manque
de communication
entre mon bureau
et vous, ici, sur le terrain.
Nous souhaitons crťer un dialogue...
- Laissez-moi terminer.
- Oui, Monsieur.
Nous avons donc dťcidť
de crťer une liaison
entre vous,
et le bureau du Gouverneur.
Une personne qui...
Dťsolť de mon retard.
... quelqu'un d'expťrimentť
ŗ qui vous pourrez adresser
toutes sortes de problŤmes,
et qui pourra gťrer
les changements
qui peuvent apparaÓtre
dans mes prisons.
Si vous me le permettez,
j'aimerais vous prťsenter
Eleanor O'Connor.
Merci, Gouverneur.
M. le Prťfet.
Je suis toute nouvelle ici,
puisque je dťbarque tout juste
de New York,
oý je remplissais les mÍmes
fonctions pour le Maire.
Je ne prťtends pas pouvoir rťgler
tous les problŤmes d'Oswald,
ni tous les vŰtres d'ailleurs,
mais je peux vous promettre que
ma porte vous sera toujours ouverte.
Mo but est de dťpoussiťrer
notre bonne vieille administration.
Merci.
TrŤs bien. Je vous invite tous
ŗ prendre un verre.
- Mme O'Connor...
- Ellie.
Ellie va rester avec nous
pour faire votre connaissance.
- Je dois y aller.
- Moi aussi.
Soyez la bienvenue.
J'adore ce que vous avez dit.
C'est la meilleure chose que le
Gouverneur ait faite depuis des annťes.
Devlin n'est pas trop apprťciť,
il me semble.
Vraiment ?
Certains l'adorent.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- Bonne chance.
- Merci.
Tim ! Attends.
Je pars avec toi.
- Elle a l'air sympa et sincŤre.
- Ouais.
- Sois sympa. N'essaie de la niquer.
- Quoi ?
Tu sautes sur tout
ce qui porte une jupe.
Mais c'est complŤtement faux.
Wittlesey, Nathan, Howell,
la gonzesse qui reprťsente l'…tat.
Je vais pas niquer
Elleanor O'Connor.
- Vraiment ?
- J'l'ai dťjŗ sautťe.
- Quoi ?
- C'est mon ex femme.
Tu rigoles... «a alors.
Dans l'Arkansas, un homme
peut lťgalement battre sa femme
une fois par mois.
A Los Angeles,
soyez attentif... un homme
a le droit de battre sa femme
avec une ceinture en cuir, ŗ condition
qu'elle fasse moins de 5 cm de large.
Ou encore, avec accord de sa femme,
il peut utiliser la ceinture
de son choix.
J'm'en fous !
C'est pas normal.
- Leo est disponible ?
- Non.
- C'est pas possible !
- Qui c'est ?
- L'agent Brass.
- C'est des conneries.
Si j'pouvais me dťgoter un autre boulot, je
dťmissionnerais illico.
Mais je suis boiteux.
Et personne n'embauche de boiteux.
- Quel est le problŤme, Dave ?
- Toutes ces conneries.
Leo ?
Il n'aime pas son nouveau poste.
Je ne veux pas qu'il soit en contact
avec les prisonniers.
Et pourquoi pas ?
S'il y a du grabuge,
il me faut des gardes efficaces,
qui puissent se dťplacer,
et non pas...
tituber.
Peu importe, il s'est blessť
au travail.
«a ne m'amuse pas.
Mais le boulot est sťrieux.
Les souhaits de Brass
sont totalement utopiques.
Et vous vouliez quoi ?
«a attendra.
Dave, tu devrais
les attaquer en justice.
Attaquer qui ?
Oz. Tout le systŤme
pťnitentiaire.
Et l'…tat si nťcessaire.
- Et comment je fais Áa ?
- Je me suis renseignť.
En 1990, le CongrŤs a votť une loi
qui protŤge les ouvriers handicapťs
de leurs employeurs.
C'est juste pour les trucs de fauteuils
roulants et d'ťquipements amťnagťs.
Non, pas seulement. Cela concerne
aussi les personnes comme toi,
qui sont rťtrogradťes
ŗ cause d'une blessure.
Il va me falloir un avocat.
Oui, mais tu pourrais
peut Ítre en parler
ŗ ce nouveau reprťsentant
du Gouverneur.
Cette Eleanor O'Connor.
Raconte-lui ce qui se passe.
OK, je le ferai.
TrŤs bien. Et...
la laisse pas te mener
en bourrique.
Tu travailles toujours aussi tard ?
Tu sais ce que c'est.
Je suis passťe tout ŗ l'heure,
mais tu n'ťtais pas lŗ.
J'ai visitť Emerald City.
T'as construit un sacrť truc.
En fait, Áa valait le coup
que tu me quittes.
- Ellie.
- C'est pas une accusation, Tim.
On a chacun fait nos choix.
C'est sympa de te voir.
Tu veux aller manger un bout ?
Non, merci. J'ai encore des tonnes
de cartons ŗ dťballer.
Une autre fois, je suppose.
Ton ami Dave Brass
est passť me voir.
Triste histoire.
Une carriŤre de basket qui s'est
envolťe avec son tendon d'Achille.
J'ai parlť au Directeur.
Il le rťaffecte ŗ la cafťtťria.
TrŤs bien.
Et il lui laissera du temps
pour ses sťances de kinť.
Je savais que tu pouvais
t'occuper de Áa.
Tu lui as dit d'attaquer
l'…tat en justice ?
Tu ťtais sťrieux ou bien
tu me testais ?
- Les deux.
- Enfoirť.
C'est la plus gentille chose
que tu ne m'aies jamais dite.
Attends un peu.
On peut mieux faire.
- Je ne demande qu'ŗ voir.
- Moi aussi.
Pas de bol.
Tu veux te faire un billard ?
Tu digŤres toujours pas
cet accident ?
Non.
J'viens de parler aux parents
de Carrie.
Ils sont en ville
pour l'enterrement.
Ils ramŤnent Jewel avec eux
dans le Montana.
Je ne reverrais sans doute jamais
ma petite-fille.
C'est relou, mais t'y peux rien.
T'as jamais eu d'enfants ?
Non.
Ma femme se souciait trop
de sa silhouette.
Donc tu ne sais vraiment pas
de quoi je parle.
Par ici, salope.
Par ici.
Salut, ma puce.
Matricule 97P468,
Charles Pancamo, surnommť
Chucky l'Homme de Main,
condamnť le 4 juillet 1997,
ŗ 35 ans de rťclusion criminelle,
dont 15 ans fermes.
Vire tes pieds !
Je vous ai tous convoquťs
parce qu'il y a du nouveau.
Peter Schibetta est de retour
aujourd'hui ŗ Em City.
Schibetta ?
Il ťtait pas ŗ l'asile ?
Plus maintenant. Et suite ŗ la longue
thťrapie qu'il a suivie,
j'ai la joie de vous annoncer
sa guťrison.
AprŤs qu'Adebisi l'ait violť,
il s'en est remis ?
Je ne minimise pas la gravitť
de son traumatisme,
ou prťtends
qu'il est comme avant.
Mais il s'est adaptť
ŗ cette nouvelle situation.
«a me fera plaisir de revoir Petey.
On a grandi ensemble.
- Et son pŤre...
- C'ťtait une lťgende.
Oui, bon,
il va avoir un peu de mal
pendant quelques jours.
Je vous demanderai donc
de faire attention ŗ lui.
Vous inquiťtez pas, McManus.
On sait prendre soin des nŰtres.
«a a changť !
L'explosion due au gaz
a presque tout dťtruit.
Bien.
Tiens.
- Suis-moi.
- Oý ?
- Le FBI veut te parler.
- Le FBI ?
- Ils veulent me parler ?
- Allez, bouge-toi, Pancamo.
Tu connais un dťnommť
Gaetano Cincetta ?
- Pas que je me souvienne.
- Tu le connais pas ?
- Pas que je me souvienne.
- Tu l'as jamais vu ?
- Pas que je me souvienne.
- C'est bizarre.
M. Cincetta, qui vient juste
d'Ítre placť dans le programme
de protection des tťmoins,
dťclare que tu l'as engagť
pour tuer quelqu'un.
Hank Schillinger.
Tu connais ce Hank Schillinger ?
- Pas que je me souvienne.
- C'est le fils de Vernon Schillinger.
- Tu connais Vernon Schillinger ?
- Pas que je me souvienne.
Il est incarcťrť ici mÍme, ŗ Oz.
Tu te souviens de lui maintenant ?
- Je n'en ai aucune "rťmissence".
- Rťminiscence !
J'le connais pas, ce gars.
Chris Keller a avouť avoir payť
un tueur ŗ gages pour tuer Schillinger,
mais il n'a jamais dťvoilť son nom.
M. Cincetta certifie
ne pas connaÓtre Keller.
Keller est passť
au dťtecteur de mensonges.
Il a en fait menti quant ŗ son
implication dans le meurtre.
Pourquoi Keller ferait-il Áa ?
Belle cravate.
Garde.
Remettez cette raclure
dans le trou duquel
elle s'est ťchappťe.
Mon prochain entretien
est avec Vern Schillinger.
On verra s'il se souvient de toi.
Il va raconter ŗ Schillinger
que je suis le commanditaire.
Et ensuite Schillinger
va demander des dťtails.
Putain !
Quand je t'ai demandť de trouver
quelqu'un pour tuer Schillinger,
tu disais que personne
ne trouverait jamais le corps.
Tu en ťtais certain.
En fait Áa n'a pris que six mois.
Si Áa c'est pas
du boulot fait ŗ moitiť...
Tu fais gaffe, toi.
En fait,
Gaetano Cincetta
m'a ťnormťment dťÁu.
Schillinger va me
couper les couilles
- s'il dťcouvre la vťritť.
- Il ne saura rien.
Bon, j'ai dťconnť,
et je vais m'occuper de tout.
«a va m'aider ŗ dormir ce soir.
C'est le problŤme ŗ Oz.
T'essaies d'avancer,
tu mets du cúur ŗ l'ouvrage,
et ŗ peine tu te dis :
"J'y suis arrivť",
que les emmerdes te tombent dessus.
Vous Ítes sŻr que Pancamo
a commanditť le meurtre de Hank ?
Pas le moindre doute.
Eh toi, Rital de mes deux !
Tu as tuť mon fils.
«a va, Áa va.
Donnez-moi un pansement.
Faites voir. OK.
Jimmy ?
Súur Pete,
qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Les Blancs ont attaquť
les Siciliens.
Pancamo avait commanditť
le meurtre de Hank Schillinger.
Je vois.
Puisque Keller n'avait rien ŗ voir
avec la mort de Hank,
l'…tat du Massachusetts n'a aucune
raison de le garder.
- Quoi ? «a veut dire que...
- Chris Keller revient ŗ Oz.
Attendez, McManus !
- Je peux vous parler ?
- J'ai pas le temps, lŗ.
Me faites pas Áa.
Insensible fils de pute.
Qu'est-ce que tu viens de dire ?
J'avais bon cúur
il y a quelques jours.
- Maintenant je suis insensible ?
- C'est pas ce que je voulais dire.
Alors, vas-y, raconte.
Je sais que vous avez tout fait
pour m'aider.
Mais en moisissant ici,
j'ai eu le temps de rťflťchir
ŗ une toute autre solution.
Si je pouvais
vous en parler ailleurs qu'ici...
Non, non.
Pas comme l'autre fois.
Mais si je pouvais passer de temps
en temps dans votre bureau.
Non !
J'y crois pas !
Et qu'est-ce que je dois
branler, moi ?
Vous Ítes mon seul pote, ici.
J'veux juste quelqu'un
avec qui parler, c'est tout.
Allez, c'est bon, White.
Finies les vacances.
- Je vous en supplie, aidez-moi.
- Je verrai ce que je peux faire.
J'fais quoi,
pendant que vous pensez ?
Si tu dois rester 24h sur 24
dans ta cellule pour te protťger...
C'est pire que cette cage.
Ce serait comme l'isolement.
Putain.
Vide ta bouche.
- Dťsolť.
- Tu es dťsolť ?
- Oui, pardonnez-moi.
- Debout.
- Disparais.
- Quoi ?
Tu ne peux mÍme pas
rťprimer ton dťsir,
un instant
pour rendre gr‚ce ŗ Allah ?
Prends ton plateau.
‘te ton keffieh.
Imam, vous Ítes trop sťvŤre.
Vous n'Ítes pas d'accord ?
Lalar est nouveau.
Rťprimandez-le,
prenez-lui son repas,
mais ne l'expulser pas du groupe.
Tu t'assois ?
Tu vas t'asseoir ?
Je t'en ai donnť la permission ?
Tu ne peux pas t'asseoir !
Je t'en ai donnť la permission ?
C'ťtait quoi, le problŤme ?
Pourquoi t'es-tu jetť
sur Ahmad Lalar ?
Vous ne m'envoyez pas au trou
et en ťchange je dois rťpondre
ŗ vos questions ?
Ouais. Bien que je n'ai pas l'impression
que tu veuilles vraiment m'aider.
Un homme qui utilisait
les mots pour se battre
a maintenant recours ŗ ses poings,
et ťtrangle des musulmans.
Je parierais ŗ 10 contre 1
que tu n'as pas la moindre idťe
pourquoi tu agis de la sorte.
Et vous perdriez le pari.
J'ai changť depuis
le dťcŤs d'Adebisi.
J'ai sauvť ma vie avec la sienne.
C'est ce cŰtť Adebisi
qui a resurgi ŗ la surface.
Aujourd'hui je rťalise que ce n'est pas
seulement revenu ŗ la surface.
C'est devenu le centre
de ma personnalitť.
C'est des conneries.
On est tous hantťs
par des dťmons.
Tu as juste abandonnť
ta vraie personnalitť
pour cette connerie que tu es en train
de dťcouvrir ŗ ton sujet.
Pourtant, tu as plus de potentiel
que quiconque ici ŗ Oz
pour t'en sortir,
et tu le sais parfaitement.
Et le fait de le savoir et de ne pas
le faire te nique encore plus.
- Balancez-moi au trou.
- Je ne te balancerai pas au trou.
- S'il vous plaÓt.
- Je t'offre un boulot ŗ la place.
- Un boulot ?
- Tu veux t'en sortir, Kareem ?
Oui.
Alors je veux que tu aides
quelqu'un d'autre.
Qu'est-ce que tu mates ?
Il fait quoi ici ?
Bordel, pourquoi il me regarde
comme Áa ?
C'est moi qui vais t'aider.
Allez tous vous faire foutre
avec votre aide.
- Il fera quoi pour moi ?
- Kareem sera ton sponsor.
- Sponsor ?
- A partir d'aujourd'hui,
toi et moi on partage tout.
On fait du sport ensemble,
on mange ensemble,
on travaille l'un avec l'autre.
Tes sťances avec Súur Pete
sont toujours de rigueur,
tout comme ton suivi
pour ta dťsintoxication.
Le Directeur exige que tu subisses
une prise de sang par semaine.
Donc, Omar,
c'est les prolongations
avec mort subite.
Tu rates une sťance, tu te bats une
seule fois, ou tu prends la tÍte ŗ Said,
et c'est retour direct
en isolement. Tu piges ?
D'accord.
Ouais, ouais.
Oh, oui !
Ah, celui-lŗ !
Jack McManus.
Cet enfoirť est machiavťlique.
Un putain de gťnie !
T'as vu comment il essaie
de trouver dix milles solutions,
pour m'aider ŗ rťsoudre mes...
comment Áa s'appelle ?
carences psychologiques.
J'l'ai quand mÍme niquť
une ou deux fois.
Mais tu sais quoi ? J'suis peut-Ítre
embarquť dans ton truc,
en train d'essayer de capter
des ondes venues de je ne sais oý...
PremiŤrement,
me pousse pas trop loin.
Oh, oh, relaxe.
Faut s'calmer, mon pote.
DeuxiŤmement,
je ne suis pas ton pote.
Tu m'appelleras par mon nom :
Imam Said.
Va te faire foutre
avec tes machins !
Tu crois que tu vas me convertir
avec tes conneries ?
Laisse tomber avec tes histoires !
Je ne vais pas te convertir.
Et je ne vais pas non plus
discuter avec toi.
On arrÍte lŗ.
- Sors.
- Quoi ?
- Dehors.
- Attends...
Vas-y, ferme la porte.
Je suis dťsolť.
Ferme-la, s'il te plaÓt.
Fais ton lit.
Fais ton lit.
Je ne me battrai pas.
- Tu m'parles ?
- RťpŤte.
Je ne me battrai pas.
Je ne me battrai pas.
Encore.
Je ne me battrai pas.
A partir de maintenant,
Áa sera ton mantra.
A chaque fois qu'un dťtenu
te provoquera,
tu diras :
"Je ne me battrai pas".
Tu le rťpŤteras sans cesse,
en criant si nťcessaire.
- Je ne me battrai pas.
- Ouais.
Je ne me battrai pas.
Je ne me battrai pas.
Je ne me battrai pas.
Si seulement j'arrivais
ŗ ne pas me battre...
Putain, Áa serait le paradis.
Tu peux pas savoir
comme je hais
ce putain d'isolement.
Si j'y retourne,
avec ces putains de vers...
Des vers ?
De quoi tu parles ?
C'est dans ma tÍte.
A chaque fois, les mÍmes vers.
Des grands, des gros, des vieux.
J'peux pas me dťbarrasser
de ces putains de vers.
J'me vois passer le reste de ma vie
ŗ Em City.
18 000 jours,
23 000 jours.
«a en fait des jours.
Des jours sans baston,
sans drogue.
C'est comme Áa que
j'le vois...
Y'a pas vraiment d'espoir.
A Nogales, en Arizona,
il est interdit
de porter des bretelles.
On se demande quand mÍme
ce qui a pu se passer.
Quel terrible accident
a-t-il pu se produire,
pour que l'on interdise
formellement
le port de bretelles dans une ville ?
Y a-t-il des groupes
secrets ŗ Nogales
qui se moquent de la loi
et se retrouvent la nuit,
pour mettre des bretelles
ŗ la place de leur ceinture ?
- Comment va Cloutier ?
- Son ťtat s'est stabilisť,
mais il ne peut pas
encore trop bouger.
Il peut parler au moins ?
Non, seulement
des gťmissements.
- Puis-je le voir ?
- Il est pas mal dťfigurť.
J'ai ťtť assistant chapelain
quand j'ťtais sťminariste
ŗ Benchley Memorial.
J'ai vu des grands brŻlťs.
Mon Dieu !
Jeremiah ?
J'aimerais dire une priŤre,
si vous n'y voyez pas d'inconvťnient.
Notre PŤre
qui Ítes aux Cieux,
que Votre nom
soit sanctifiť ;
que Votre rŤgne vienne,
que Votre volontť soit faite...
sur la terre
comme au Ciel ;
donnez-nous aujourd'hui
notre pain de ce jour,
et pardonnez nos offenses...
C'est ouvert.
- Mukada ?
- Entrez.
Laissez ouvert.
Pourquoi vouliez-vous me voir ?
Il paraÓt que vous allez
cťlťbrer une messe
en l'honneur des victimes dťcťdťes
dans l'accident de bus.
En effet. Et j'ai demandť ŗ Arif,
au Rabin Gold
et au Rťvťrend Taylor
d'y participer.
- Mais pas ŗ moi.
- Vous ?
Depuis le malencontreux accident
survenu ŗ Jeremiah Cloutier...
Je ne considŤre pas le fait d'Ítre
propulsť contre un mur, un accident.
Je parle de ses brŻlures,
suite ŗ l'explosion au gaz.
Depuis cet incident,
j'ai ťtť amenť ŗ prÍcher
pour de nombreux
chrťtiens ŗ Oz.
Lire la Bible,
debout sur une scŤne
ne s'appelle pas prÍcher.
Vous m'en voulez toujours
parce que j'ai rejetť le catholicisme.
Au contraire. Cela me soulage que vous
ne fassiez plus partie de ma paroisse.
J'exige de pouvoir
prendre part au service.
- Vous n'avez pas les diplŰmes requis.
- J'ai ťtť ordonnť prÍtre.
Et depuis quand ?
«a m'a coŻtť 50$, par courrier.
Sortez.
- J'irai voir directement le Directeur.
- SŻr. Et il vous rira au nez.
Alors j'irai voir directement Dieu.
…coute, p'tit vaurien,
nous savons tous que tu es impliquť
dans l'accident de Cloutier.
Et dŤs qu'il sera
en mesure de parler,
tu te retrouveras en isolement
pour le reste de tes jours !
On doit descendre Cloutier
immťdiatement.
Sa gorge est encore amochťe,
mais dŤs qu'il ira mieux,
il va chanter,
et on est tous niquťs.
J'suis dťjŗ niquť, tu vois ?
Je sais bien, Jaz.
Tu as pris pour nous
parce que tu ťtais
en charge ce jour-lŗ,
et donc c'est toi qu'as morflť.
Mais c'est pas une raison
pour que Cloutier reste en vie.
Et s'il meurt,
les gardiens me tombent dessus.
Exact. Ce qui veut dire
que celui qui le tuera
doit Ítre insoupÁonnable.
Jim ?
J'peux pas.
Cloutier m'a fait dťcouvrir Jťsus.
Et si tu n'aides pas,
tu deviens un associť du diable.
Ouais.
Fais ton boulot, ou crŤve.
Jim ?
Jim Burns ?
Ils veulent que tu me tues, Jim.
Et tu sais que
tu ne dois pas le faire.
- Oui.
- C'est pour cela que je te demande
de les tuer.
Tue Hoyt et Kirk.
Le Rťvťrend Cloutier
m'a rendu visite hier soir.
- Pour te tailler une pipe ?
- Y'a rien de marrant.
- T'as rÍvť.
- C'ťtait pas un rÍve.
- Gonzesse.
- Tu veux te dťbarrasser de ta mission.
Va tuer ce fils de pute.
- Non !
- Non ?
Il m'a dit de te tuer !
C'ťtait de la lťgitime dťfense.
C'ťtait de la lťgitime dťfense.
J'ai des tťmoins.
Vous n'avez rien contre moi.
Y'avaient 10 mecs autour.
Envoyez-le au trou.
C'ťtait de la lťgitime dťfense !
Il y aura une messe pour Jim ?
Bien sŻr.
On doit prier pour
le repos de son ‚me.
Extinction des feux !
Les lois crťťes par l'homme
sont arbitraires,
et temporaires.
Ce qui ťtait lťgal hier,
devient tout ŗ coup illťgal,
selon le bon vouloir d'un Prťsident.
Par contre, les lois divines
sont gravťes dans la pierre.
Elles ne changent pas.
Et si vous ne respectez
pas les lois divines,
vous n'allez pas en prison.
Vous allez en enfer.
Et vous y brŻlez.
Hoyt !
N'aie pas peur.
Selon Sigmung Freud,
les rêves serviraient
à assouvir des impulsions
que la société considère
inacceptables.
Ainsi, au lieu de tuer
un père abusif,
ce qui ne serait pas
la meilleure chose à faire,
nous rêvons que
nous défenestrons notre patron.
Freud suggère également
que notre esprit peut modifier
nos rêves afin de contenir
nos émotions violentes.
Ainsi, moins émotifs,
nous nous réveillons le matin
et sommes prêts à nous comporter
en parfait citoyen.
Le problème à Oz,
c'est que nous ne rêvons pas
de défenestrer notre patron.
Nous le faisons.
Alors, Alvarez,
qui t'a fait ça ?
- Si seulement je le savais.
- Tu ne sais pas qui t'a poignardé ?
Tout s'est passé tellement vite,
vous savez.
Mon enquête
est terminée, alors.
Ça vous fait vraiment
de la peine, hein ?
Je ne suis peut-être
pas docteur, mais...
j'en ai vu des blessures
au coup de couteau.
Si la lame avait été un demi-
centimètre sur la gauche,
on ne serait pas
en train de discuter.
Un demi-centimètre ?
Sérieux ?
Sérieux.
T'appelles pas ça du bol ?
Vous me renvoyez
en isolement ?
Non, non.
C'est pourtant pas l'envie
qui m'en manque,
crois-moi.
Mais je me suis dit
que je te verrais plutôt
à Em City.
Peut-être que la prochaine fois,
tu seras moins chanceux.
- Faut qu'on parle.
- Tu veux que je te plante encore ?
Pas de problème.
- J'peux m'asseoir ?
- Suce-moi.
Lève-toi.
Assois-toi.
Alors ?
Tu as essayé de me tuer.
Pas du tout.
Et t'es vivant, non ?
C'était notre deal.
Tu devais me poignarder
dans l'épaule.
La lame est passée à un demi-
centimètre de mon cœur.
T'as dû bouger,
que veux-tu que je te dise ?
T'as rien à dire.
Sache seulement
que je connais la vérité.
Je vais respecter notre accord.
J'suis pas mort.
Je ne me vengerai pas.
C'est une bonne idée
que de laisser tomber.
Écoute-moi bien.
Tu ne seras jamais plus
le bienvenu à El Norte.
Par contre, je peux te garantir
- qu'on te laissera tranquille.
- De quoi tu parles ?
On est à égalité.
Pardon.
Je veux que tu me plantes.
J'sais pas d'où t'est
venue cette idée,
mais c'est top,
et je vois le résultat.
Mais surtout, je vois
comment se comporte Morales.
Il fait le malin devant toi.
Il se la joue du style
généreux, et tout.
Mais en réalité, j'vois
la trouille dans son regard.
J'suis de ton côté.
- Tu es de mon côté ?
- J'veux faire partie de ton gang.
C'est toi la relève, et je veux
devenir ton lieutenant.
Plante-moi.
J'vais pas te planter.
Alors comme ça,
tu veux faire tes preuves ?
Oui.
Tu vas faire
autre chose pour moi.
C'que tu veux.
Tue Guerra.
Lève-toi, Morales.
OK.
Tu sais qui je suis ?
Dave Brass,
le joueur de basket.
Vous avez joué avec McManus
contre Vahue.
Vous vous débrouillez,
pour un blanc.
Qui m'a coupé
le tendon d'Achille ?
J'en sais rien.
Je me moque de savoir
qui l'a commandité.
Tout ce que je veux savoir,
c'est qui l'a fait.
J'aimerais bien
pouvoir vous aider.
Menteur de mes deux.
Tu vas regretter
de ne rien savoir.
Vous savez...
vous aviez le meilleur jeu
de jambes que je n'aie jamais vu.
Appui à gauche, appui à droite,
et droit au panier.
J'sais pas combien de fois
vous avez niqué Vahue avec ça.
Mais comme on dit...
Vous retirez le jeu de jambes
à un défenseur,
et vous vous retrouvez
avec un gardien de prison boiteux.
- Qu'est-ce tu fais ?
- Je commence une pétition
pour m'opposer à l'arrêt
de la diffusion de "Miss Sally".
C'est la signature de Stanton.
- C'est un bon gars.
- Mais il est en isolement cellulaire.
Bon, ça va,
j'ai imité quelques signatures.
Wangler, Adebisi...
- Groves. Groves ?
- Bon, elles sont toutes fausses.
Aucunes de ces racailles
ne signeraient une telle pétition.
- Tu veux signer ?
- Le prends pas mal,
mais tout ce qui m'intéresse,
c'est mon petit-fils et sa bataille
contre la leucémie.
Désolé.
Et ça en est où ?
Faut payer pour jouer.
Un remède peut être trouvé.
Mais ça coûterait une fortune,
et je ne sais pas
où trouver l'argent.
qui va nous parler du tirage du loto
de la semaine prochaine.
- Comment allez-vous ?
- Très bien. Merci de passer nous voir...
Qui sont les abrutis
qui jouent au loto ?
Moi.
- Moi aussi.
- C'est ce que je dis : des abrutis.
Parmi 51 numéros, tu dois
en trouver non seulement un,
mais six, en un tirage.
- C'est possible.
- T'as plus de chance
d'être foudroyé par la foudre
que de gagner.
Il y a environ 1 000 personnes
par an qui gagnent plus
d'un million de dollars, au loto.
Alors que moins de 100 sont
foudroyées chaque année.
... Deux millions de dollars,
alors tentez votre chance.
Vous pourriez être
le prochain vainqueur.
- Pardon, Agent Brass.
- Quoi ?
Bob Rebadow.
Vous m'avez toujours
paru sympa.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Je voudrais que vous m'achetiez
un ticket de loto.
Il y a une cagnotte de deux millions.
Vous aurez votre part.
- Une part de quoi ?
- Du gros lot.
Et tu vas gagner ?
Dieu me l'a dit.
Voici les numéros gagnants.
Salut, Dave.
C'est quoi le topo
avec ce Bob Rebadow ?
Ah, rien.
Pourquoi, il tourne autour de toi ?
C'est juste que ce type
a l'air psycho sur les bords.
Pendant le repas,
il m'a raconté que Dieu lui parlait.
Ça fait un bout de temps
qu'il a des tête à tête
avec le Tout-Puissant.
Mais en fait,
il est assez stable.
C'est la première que je touche
depuis mon problème au tendon.
C'est une super balle,
pas trop neuve et qui adhère.
Tu l'as tellement bien en main
que tu joues comme Pete Maravich.
C'est vrai !
Pistol Pete.
Le meilleur scoreur dans toute
l'histoire du basket universitaire.
Quand il était môme,
il se trimballait tout le temps
avec un ballon de basket,
où qu'il aille.
Que ce soit à l'école,
ou avec sa petite copine.
Il dormait avec son ballon,
comme s'il était marié avec.
Du coup, j'ai fait pareil.
J'ai juste arrêté de dormir avec
en entrant en fac.
Mais à part ça...
- Si tu veux shooter, vas-y.
- Non, c'est bon.
- J'peux rester un peu.
- Faut que j'y aille.
Il faut que je m'arrête en route
pour acheter un ticket de loto.
On se fera ça
un autre soir alors ?
On reste un peu plus tard,
et on joue un peu.
Tu sais comment
Pete Maravich est mort ?
En jouant au basket.
Il était en retraite depuis huit ans.
Et juste en jouant, comme ça
avec des potes, crise cardiaque.
En pleine forme pendant des années,
et du jour au lendemain, mort.
Jusqu'à ce que la mort nous sépare !
Au moins, il a vécu comme ça.
Mais moi, je ne pourrai pas.
Alors arrête
de me casser les couilles
avec tes idées de jouer
ensemble, d'accord ?
Tout d'abord, je suis heureux
que tu sois totalement rétabli.
Ensuite, il me semble que tu veuilles
retourner à Emerald City.
Tu comprendras que ce n'est pas
une décision facile pour moi.
Avant ta blessure,
tu menaçais en permanence la vie
d'Enrique Morales et des Latinos.
Et en plus, Cyril O'Reily
est incarcéré là-bas.
M. McManus,
l'attaque de Cyril O'Reily
est peut-être la meilleure des choses
qui me soit arrivée.
En frôlant la mort, j'ai réalisé
tout ce que j'avais fait.
Et le fait de m'en sortir
m'a permis de voir
ce que je pouvais accomplir.
Vous avez déjà vécu ça ?
En fait, oui.
Le problème n'est
même pas de savoir
si vous allez me laissez
retourner à Em City,
bien que j'en meure d'envie.
Pourquoi ?
J'en ai aucune idée.
OK. On essaie.
Par contre, je veux que tu suives
une thérapie avec Peter Marie.
Excuse-moi pour le mal
que je t'ai fait.
Cyril, pourquoi avez-vous
frappé Kenmin ?
Il tabassait Ryan.
Et pourquoi
tabassiez-vous Ryan ?
J'venais de passer
la journée dans la cage.
J'étais chaud.
J'voulais frimer un peu.
- C'était débile.
- C'est ça.
- Ryan.
- Quoi ?
Ses conneries ont
presque envoyé Cyril
à l'asile.
Pas d'interruptions
ni de grossièretés.
Ce qui m'est arrivé
est de ma faute.
C'est pourquoi je veux
enterrer la hache de guerre.
Repose ton cul sur ta chaise.
Non. Moi aussi,
j'veux la paix.
Allez-y.
Putain.
Matricule 02L333,
Li Chen ;
condamné le 14 janvier 2002,
quatre tentatives de meurtre.
Verdict : 32 ans de réclusion
dont 20 ans fermes.
C'est bien.
- Arrête de te marrer, Ryan.
- Ryan, je t'en prie.
J'suis désolé, mais il chante
vraiment comme un pied.
Tu sais parfaitement que le but
n'est pas de devenir Pavarotti.
Il s'agit d'apprendre à s'exprimer
au travers de la musique.
- C'était très bien, Cyril.
- Merci.
- C'était plus du "Pava-pourri".
- Vas-y ! Essaie.
Non, non. L'idée était
que je suive tes cours
pour pouvoir passer plus de temps
avec toi. Pas pour chanter.
La leçon est terminée,
et vendredi prochain,
je veux t'entendre chanter.
D'accord.
Mais, je ferai mieux que ça.
Suzanne, les deux étudiants
suivants sont là.
C'est quoi cette histoire ?
Il paraît que ta mère
donne des cours.
J'me suis dit
que j'essaierais bien.
- Jia Kenmin.
- Suzanne Fitzgerald.
- Li Chen.
- Soyez les bienvenus.
- On y va, O'Reily.
- C'est bon, j'arrive.
- Tu t'amènes ?
- Lâchez-moi !
Salut, les gars.
Vous avez
un peu d'expérience...
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Ryan ?
- J'le sens pas.
- De quoi ?
- Ce jaune, Jia Kenmin.
Il manigance un truc
contre nous, à coup sûr.
Et j'suis sûr qu'il va
s'en pendre à ma mère.
- Elle est sympa.
- Oui, et elle te trouve sympa aussi.
Tu veux faire un échange ?
Échanger quoi ?
Je te donne ce qui me tient le plus
à cœur, si tu me donnes ta mère.
Y'a rien à échanger. On la partage.
Tu le sais très bien.
- Vraiment ?
- Bien sûr.
J'partage pas tout avec toi ?
Jia.
Ta mère est formidable.
- Et bien, qu'elle reste comme ça.
- Comment ça ?
Si tu la cherches, je te renvoie
dans un coma permanent.
T'as rien à craindre avec moi.
Par contre Li Chen,
c'est un autre numéro.
Il est complètement taré.
Vous rêvez,
vous êtes en plein sommeil profond
et quelqu'un apparaît.
Quelqu'un de décédé,
que vous aimez.
Un père, une mère, un ami,
et vous êtes heureux de voir
cette personne en bonne santé.
Heureux de pouvoir lui dire les choses
que vous ne lui avez jamais dites.
Puis vous vous réveillez,
et cette personne
est toujours morte,
et vous devez revivre
le deuil une fois encore.
Putain, c'est pas trop tôt.
Qu'est-ce qui est arrivé
au billard ?
Ils sont en train de le réparer.
Passe le mot. Je veux une réunion
avec tout le gang.
On a des trucs à finir
avec Chucky Pancamo.
Quoi d'neuf, Petey ?
Schillinger est sorti
du trou.
Et toi, tu sors quand d'ici ?
Aucune idée.
Dr Nathan ne me dit rien.
- Tout est OK avec Morales ?
- Ouais.
- Les drogues circulent toujours.
- Et à la cuisine ?
Tout est tranquille.
Attention à pas prendre de mauvaises
habitudes à force de jouer le boss.
- J'suis pas encore mort.
- Je sais, je sais.
Il faut punir Schillinger
pour ce qu'il t'a fait.
On s'occupe de cet enculé de Nazi
dès mon retour.
J'ai des news.
Schillinger est sorti du trou.
Bien.
Maintenant on admire le spectacle.
Les Nazis qui foutent
une trempe aux Siciliens.
Ouais, mais ça règlera pas
le problème des métèques.
Et ils sont plus forts que jamais.
Et Morales ne va pas rompre
son pacte avec Pancamo.
A moins que Morales
en profite
pour faire le ménage
et choisir
de nouveaux associés.
Va dire à Enrique que je veux
discuter avec lui.
Plus je vieillis,
et plus je me rends compte
que ma soif n'est
qu'une habitude.
Ma soif de pouvoir se tarit.
Mais j'en ai besoin
parce que j'en ai toujours eu.
A mon arrivée à Emerald City,
tu m'as gentiment proposé
de partager le trafic de drogues,
mais comme j'aime pas
m'associer, j'ai refusé.
Et depuis lors, on n'a pas
arrêté de s'affronter,
sans qu'aucun de nous y gagne
vraiment grand chose.
J'commence à croire
que tu es immortel.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je les vire.
Non. Sois sûr que tes gars
sont prêts. Et attendons.
Je te suis pas, là.
Il y a des mois, on avait
décidé de faire la paix
mais aucun de nous n'a respecté
ses engagements.
Je propose que nous
le fassions maintenant.
Je propose que l'on s'associe.
Pour la paix.
J'y crois pas.
Maintenant on a
une seule famille, bien unie.
Jusqu'à ce que Pancamo
en entende parler.
Putain.
Faut qu'on parle à Chucky.
Vas-y, oublie Chucky.
- Petey.
- Mon père s'occupe du business.
- Et je m'en occupe là.
- Abedisi t'a descendu.
C'était de la faute de Pancamo.
Cet enculé devait m'épauler
- et il a fait que dalle.
- Alors qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
On va leur montrer
qui commande.
On va détruire
ces enculés de Nazis.
- Il est où, Said ?
- Pourquoi ?
Il me faut du renfort.
J'veux discuter avec Imam Said.
Pardon.
Puis-je m'asseoir ?
- J'irai droit au but.
- Je t'en prie.
Toi et moi, nous avons des intérêts
et des ennemis en communs.
Schillinger.
On veut tous les deux le niquer.
J'suis sûr qu'on peut s'arranger.
Tu t'es fait violer par Adebisi.
Mais ce que je demande...
Je te réponds.
Tu as peut-être fait
le deuil de ton viol,
mais ça ne change
pas la réalité. A Oz,
tu seras perçu comme
la pute d'Adebisi.
Quoi que tu fasses,
tu ne changeras rien.
Si, je peux.
- Bonne chance.
- Merci.
Peter ?
Quoi ?
Il a raison, tu sais.
Et t'as beau être notre boss,
on ne se battra
contre les Aryens
que quand Pancamo le décidera.
Allez tous vous faire foutre.
J'peux vous aider ?
- On vient chercher le billard.
- Il est réparé ?
J'ai bidouillé le retour de balle
qui débloquait.
Il est prêt mon grille-pain ?
Relax, Max.
Tu vois pas que je suis occupé ?
C'est l'heure du repas,
et ces charlots peuvent attendre.
On n'attend pas pour les Spaghettis.
Je vais te montrer
les bonnes manières.
C'est quand tu veux, trou duc.
Fais gaffe !
Cassez-vous !
Lâchez-moi !
- J'me suis toujours demandé...
- Lâchez-moi !
si la bite d'Adebisi était
plus grosse que la mienne.
Va te faire foutre !
Va te faire foutre !
- A toi de me dire.
- Non !
Il ne saigne plus,
mais il est pas mal amoché.
Emmenez-le au service
psychiatrique.
Super. Le billard va très bien.
Ça fait longtemps que
vous travaillez pour le directeur ?
Pas trop, non.
C'est moi qu'ai sauvé Glynn,
vous savez ?
Parce qu'au moment où Clayton
Hughes allait le poignarder,
j'ai chopé Hughes pour l'arrêter.
- Vous êtes très mignonne.
- Merci.
Ça va faire un an que je suis
en isolement cellulaire,
et vous êtes la première vraie femme
que je vois depuis ma sortie.
- Vraie femme ?
- Oui, vous savez, on a...
- nos "femmes" prisonniers.
- Penders, entrez.
- A plus.
- Magne-toi !
Fermez la porte.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Je veux être certain
de ne plus retourner en isolement.
Je pense donc que le mieux pour moi
est d'éviter tout type de...
d'altercations.
Donc, moins je suis face à face
avec les autres détenus, mieux c'est.
Alors, au lieu
de bosser à l'atelier,
- j'pourrais peut-être bosser ici.
- Dans mon service ?
- Oui.
- Non.
- M. le Directeur...
- Je ne te dois rien.
Je ne supporte pas
ce genre de chantage.
Le fait de te voir tous les jours
me rappellerait
ce qui est arrivé à Clayton Hughes.
Ma réponse reste négative.
Le mieux pour toi est de te cacher
quand tu me vois arriver,
parce que mon grand plaisir serait
de te rebalancer en isolement.
Que je ne te vois plus.
Compris ? Agent !
C'est pas juste,
c'est pas juste.
- Au revoir.
- C'est pas juste.
Les rêves humides sont top.
Ils commencent
à l'âge de 1 2 ans.
Chaque nuit,
vous faites l'amour
aux plus belles femmes
du monde.
Pam Grier, Barbi Benton,
et même Jodie Jensen
qui était avec vous en CM2.
Avec l'âge, la fréquence
de ces rêves diminue,
mais vous vous tapez
des vraies nanas maintenant.
Et un jour vous réalisez
que votre femme
ne ressemble ni à Barbi Benton,
ni à Pam Grier,
et qu'elle ne vous aimera jamais
avec autant d'innocence
que Jodie Jensen.
Les rêves humides...
c'était le bon temps.
Cette loi réintroduit
la peine de mort
dans notre État
et limite le choix d'un condamné
entre la chaise électrique
et l'injection.
Je n'ai aucun doute
quant au résultat
de l'examen de la constitutionnalité
de cette loi.
Et je répète mon message
à destination des mécréants.
Arrêtez d'assassiner nos familles.
Arrêtez la violence.
Tu veux ma place ?
Non, pourquoi ?
Tu vas te tordre le cou,
à regarder comme ça.
C'est juste...
que Keller revient
aujourd'hui de Cedar Junction.
On le sait.
J'l'ai pas vu depuis des mois,
et ça me rend nerveux.
- De quoi j'ai l'air ?
- Nerveux.
J'espérais que
tu dises "baisable".
Partie annulée.
Merci d'être là pour m'accueillir,
M. le Directeur.
Y'a pas de tapis rouge ?
- Laisse tomber les blagues.
- Très bien.
Cette fois, je veux que vous sachiez
que je veux être
un détenu parfait.
J'serai un exemple
à Emerald City.
Bonne idée, à part que
tu ne vas pas à Emerald City.
Où alors ? Unité B ?
Pour le moment, tu seras
en détention protégée.
En détention protégée ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu verras bien.
Donnez-lui des vêtements,
et mettez-le en salle deux.
Ça alors, M. Taylor,
c'est une surprise.
Assois-toi.
J'ai roulé toute la journée.
J'suis bien debout.
Comme tu veux.
L'État du Massachusetts
t'a libéré
parce que Cincetta dit que tu ne l'as
pas engagé pour tuer Schillinger.
Chucky Pancamo l'a engagé.
- C'est pas du nouveau.
- Exact.
Mais j'ai une question.
Pourquoi as-tu avoué
avoir engagé Cincetta ?
Pourquoi protéger Pancamo ?
- J'lui devais une faveur.
- Menteur.
Prouvez-le.
J'ai des nouvelles
fraîches par contre.
En ce qui concerne
le meurtre de Bryce Tibbetts...
Nous avons un témoin.
Tu te rends compte,
après tout ce temps.
Quelqu'un décide enfin
de faire son devoir.
Ce bon citoyen
a identifié ta photo.
Demain, nous allons
tous les deux en ville
voir si il ou elle te reconnaît
parmi d'autres individus.
En attendant,
tu restes en isolement.
Mais t'installe pas trop
quand même.
Tu prendras bientôt domicile
dans le couloir de la mort.
Agent, mettez
ce caviar au frais.
Mets une croix sur celui-là.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Ça été, ton entretien
avec Freddy Rudolph ?
Sa demande de liberté
conditionnelle semble avancer.
- Super.
- C'est vrai que...
je me suis déjà trompée
dans le passé.
Arrête de t'en vouloir,
Catherine.
Tu as fait ce que
tu pouvais pour moi.
Je dois y aller. Viens.
Fais une bise à papa.
Je t'aime.
- Tu veux faire une bise à papa ?
- Oui.
Tu sens bon. On se voit samedi.
D'accord, ma puce ?
Au revoir.
Alors, Agent Howell.
On va passer beaucoup
de temps ensemble.
Tu vas y arriver ?
Je sais que tu vas m'y aider.
- Sœur Pete.
- Bonjour, Chris.
On peut se parler en privé ?
Éclatez-vous, ma Sœur.
- Ça va ?
- Un peu perdu.
Hier, j'étais à Cedar Junction,
condamné à perpet'
pour avoir commandité
un meurtre,
et maintenant on me dit
que je ne suis plus coupable.
Et que je retourne à Oz.
J'étais tout content
de revenir ici,
et maintenant le FBI me dit
qu'ils ont un témoin contre moi,
dans une vieille affaire.
J'encours la peine de mort.
Il vous faut un bon avocat.
Et vous en connaissez un ?
Je vous en trouverai un.
Faites-moi savoir si vous avez
besoin de quoi que ce soit.
Sœur Pete ?
Je veux voir Beecher.
Je verrai ce que je peux faire.
La peine de mort ?
- Mon Dieu.
- J'espère que Catherine McClain
nous conseillera un avocat
de son cabinet.
Catherine ?
C'est une bonne idée.
En attendant, j'essaierai d'avoir
plus de détails auprès du directeur.
Tant que vous y êtes,
dites-lui aussi
que je souhaite voir Keller.
Je verrai ce que je peux faire.
- Non et non.
- Et pourquoi ?
Vous n'allez pas
aimer la réponse.
- Allez-y.
- Chris Keller a torturé,
violé et tué trois hommes.
Pourquoi devrais-je
le satisfaire ?
Et Beecher ?
Beecher paie de nouveau
les pots cassés.
- Voyons.
- Le dossier est clos.
- Leo !
- Le dossier est clos.
Vous savez, quand vous êtes
dans votre voiture,
ou sous la douche, et qu'un super
rêve vous revient à l'esprit,
un rêve qui vous avait plu
ou même déplu,
et vous essayez de vous
souvenir des moindres détails ?
Vous vous réveillez, et vous avez raté
le stop, ou la douche est froide.
A Oz, si vous êtes
sous la douche
et que vous rêver
pendant une seconde,
vous pouvez être sûr de vous faire
poignarder dans le dos.
Les rêveries peuvent tuer.
Qu'est-ce tu veux ?
Qu'est-ce tu veux ?
Rien.
Rien du tout.
Casse-toi, Robson.
Casse-toi, Robson.
- Imam, allez.
- Dis un seul mot, Robson.
Un seul mot,
et je t'éclate ta tronche
de beauf sur place.
Bouge-toi de là.
Très bien, Messire.
Imam,
vous devez contrôler votre colère.
- Souvenez-vous des mots d'Allah.
- Lesquels, Arif ?
Allah peut quelque
chose pour moi ?
Ça ne me regarde peut-être pas,
mais il a des problèmes.
Je sais à quoi tu penses,
Ahmad.
Mais Imam Said
est un grand homme.
Il n'est pas très bien
en ce moment,
et nous ne pouvons pas
l'abandonner.
Je ne parle pas de l'abandonner.
C'est notre frère.
Mais est-il toujours notre leader ?
- Je ne crois pas...
- Ça suffit !
Aide-moi à ramasser
ces perles.
- Vous vous êtes déjà drogué ?
- Non.
Je n'ai même jamais
touché un joint.
Moi, si.
- Kareem ?
- Quoi ?
Mon chemin vers Allah
n'était pas parsemé de roses.
C'est seulement que...
quand j'en prenais,
tu ne m'as jamais dit...
Je ne suis pas fier
de cette période ma vie.
Alors que maintenant, si ?
- Suis-moi.
- Tu rigoles, là ?
- C'est "Miss Sally" à la télé.
- Je te dis de venir.
- Que faisais-tu avec Poet ?
- Mais rien du tout.
- Il te vendait de la drogue ?
- Arrête un peu.
Non, on parlait de "Miss Sally".
Je t'interdis de lui parler.
C'est quoi le problème ? On est
des vieux potes, c'est tout.
Qu'est-ce que je viens de te dire ?
Et souviens-toi
que si je dis un mot à McManus,
tu te retrouves en isolement.
Allez, vas-y.
- Va ranger ta cellule.
- De quoi ?
T'as intérêt à m'obéir.
T'as pas l'air d'avoir
la forme, mon pote.
Y'a un sacré paquet de drogue
qui vient d'arriver.
Lâche-moi. Tu sais que je ne peux pas
faire ces conneries.
Cet enculé de Said est
sur mon dos 24 heures sur 24.
Et Glynn me fait tester
une fois par semaine.
Glynn me faisait aussi subir
des tests l'an dernier.
J'me suis quand même débrouillé.
Tu connais Billy Plana ?
Il s'occupe
des prélèvements d'urine.
Il pissait pour moi et
échangeait les flacons.
Tu peux payer, non ?
S'il le faisait pour moi,
il le fera pour toi.
Vas-y, rencarde-moi.
- Je m'occupe de toi.
- Omar.
- Putain de merde.
- Omar.
Oh, non.
- T'as quoi dans la main ?
- J'allais jute...
Silence.
Ouvre ta main.
Donne.
C'est pas vrai !
Oublie Omar, OK ?
Je t'aurai prévenu, Poet.
- J'en ai plein le cul.
- Pas si vite.
Mon blé.
Putain, il a mon pognon.
J'devrais y aller.
Omar n'a rien pris ?
- Non.
- Ça va, alors.
Mais il le fera d'ici peu,
dès qu'il trouve un dealer.
Bon, alors.
- Dis-moi s'il en prend.
- McManus !
C'est tout ce que
vous avez à dire ?
Que veux-tu que je te dise ?
Vous m'avez demandé
d'aider White.
- De le sauver.
- Oui.
Et vous m'avez convaincu
que si je pouvais l'aider,
cela m'aiderait également.
J'vous ai cru, McManus.
J'ai tout gobé.
L'hameçon et le bouchon.
Et j'suis toujours partant.
Il me faut cette victoire
pour mon âme.
Je sais.
- Mais vous refusez de m'aider ?
- Je ne refuse rien.
J'ai rien à offrir.
La balle est dans ton camp.
Omar White est
un grand mystère.
Il y a une solution, mais ce n'est pas
moi qui vais la trouver.
Je sais que tu peux.
Maintenant, je suis que spectateur.
Mais ton instinct t'aidera
à trouver la solution.
Autrement, on est tous niqués.
Omar, une fois
que tu as terminé,
viens me voir.
Tu sais quoi ?
Tu me prends la tête grave.
Compris ?
J'ai pas envie de recevoir
une leçon sur la drogue.
- C'est pas à propos de drogue.
- Alors quoi ?
A propos de ce que tu veux.
Une simple conversation.
J'ai pas envie d'entamer
une conversation maintenant, OK ?
On va avoir une conversation.
Compris ?
Quelle est ta couleur préférée ?
- Réponds.
- Le blanc.
Blanc. Et pourquoi ?
A cause de ton nom ?
C'est pur,
et tout le bordel.
Bien. Une autre.
Quelle est la dernière chose
qui t'ait vraiment passionné ?
Pour être sincère, j'me suis
toujours foutu de tout.
Arrête. Tu dois bien
avoir un truc.
Un truc que t'aurais
voulu faire ou devenir.
Dis-moi quelque chose, Omar.
Un cow-boy.
C'est sérieux. Un putain
de cow-boy noir.
J'ai vu un film
quand j'étais môme,
un vieux film, et tout,
avec Herb Jeffries.
Ça s'appelait
"The Bronze Buckaroo".
Ouais, c'est ça.
Un western avec des noirs.
Un western de noirs,
avec des cow-boys noirs,
et pour un public de noirs,
dans les années 30.
T'aimes les pistolets
et les chevaux ?
Oublie les pistolets et les chevaux.
Ce Herb Jeffries...
il savait chanter.
Bonne nouvelle.
- Bonne nouvelle ?
- Tu t'es découvert un centre d'intérêt.
C'est un véritable pas en avant.
Trouver un moyen constructif
pour occuper ton temps
peut faire la différence.
Je vais prendre rendez-vous
avec Suzanne Fitzgerald.
La mère d'O'Reily ?
Elle fait son service
d'utilité publique.
- Je vais voir qui ?
- C'est une prof de chant.
Ça m'a l'air super,
à part un truc.
- Je ne sais pas chanter.
- "Qui ne tente rien, n'a rien", Omar.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
Tu es mécontente parce qu'on a débuté
un programme de musique ?
Non, je suis mécontente parce que
je viens juste d'en entendre parler.
Je suis la liaison du Gouverneur,
tout de même.
Et tu dois tout lui raconter,
peut-être ?
Il n'y a pas assez d'argent
pour ce programme.
Et tous les frais engagés ?
Suzanne Fitzgerald
est bénévole.
Les frais sont minimum.
Je ferai comme d'habitude.
Piocher par-ci, piocher par-là.
L'art est important dans la vie.
Vraiment ? Et je ne pouvais pas te faire
visiter un musée ou une galerie
quand nous étions mariés.
Surtout les soirs de foot.
Je te dis que ce programme sera
bénéfique pour certains de ces types.
Tim, tu vas encore te planter.
Tu te mets toujours
dans de telles situations.
- C'est faux.
- Ah bon ?
Et nous, alors ?
Faites un budget prévisionnel.
Je verrai si je peux dénicher
de l'argent auprès de Devlin.
Vous avez eu raison
de l'épouser.
Et elle a eu raison de divorcer.
- J'suis pas obligé de chanter ?
- Non, pas du tout.
Vraiment ?
Mais vous devriez
essayer avant de capituler.
Non.
J'ai pas une belle voix.
Elle est trop grave.
Comme Barry White.
Mais, en mauvais.
Je crois que vous êtes ténor.
On va essayer ça.
Allez-y.
Vous savez,
vous êtes très belle.
Bon.
Autre chose.
Essayons une chanson,
d'accord ?
Je suis sûre
que vous la connaissez.
C'est "Jésus m'aime".
Oui, mais vous êtes chanteuse.
A vous.
Il paraît que...
Il paraît que vous êtes
la mère d'O'Reily ?
C'est exact.
Vous le faisiez chanter
- quand il était petit ?
- Non.
Et pourquoi pas ?
C'est une longue histoire.
La mienne aussi.
Je ne vous demande pas
l'impossible.
C'est pas vrai !
J'essaie d'être courtois.
J'essaie, non ?
J'suis pas obligé
de chanter, non ?
Je voulais que vous essayiez.
Asseyez-vous.
Putain de menteuse.
Tout le monde ment toujours.
Agent Brass !
Je suis désolé.
Je suis désolé.
Je suis désolé.
Je regrette.
Pardonnez-moi.
J'voulais pas m'énerver.
Tout va bien, Suzanne ?
Oui, c'est bon.
- Tout va bien.
- Lève-toi, racaille !
Debout.
Allez, on essaie.
Asseyez-vous.
Allez.
On essaie ça ?
Il paraît que chaque individu dans
nos rêves est en fait nous-mêmes.
Si vous rêvez de vous-même et d'un
mec que vous ne pouvez pas blairer,
en fait vous rêvez
de vous-même
et de ce côté de vous-même
que vous ne pouvez pas blairer.
Ta mère s'était vraiment emballée
pour les droits civiques.
Les choses étaient pas aussi
mauvaises que dans le Sud.
Mais elle a traîné ton père
jusqu'à Washington
pour écouter Martin Luther King
et participer à la manifestation.
- Tu n'y étais pas ?
- Non.
J'suis resté à attendre
de meilleurs jours.
Tes parents participaient
à l'évènement le plus important
du XXème siècle
pendant que je picolais
comme un taré.
Putain, qu'est-ce que
maman me manque.
Je sais bien.
J'ai reçu une carte
de ma tendre.
- Elle est a Maui.
- Maui ? C'est génial, là-bas.
Tu sais que tu peux
y escalader un volcan ?
Et les femmes ont de superbes...
De superbes personnalités.
- T'y es déjà allé ?
- Non.
Je l'ai lu dans
"National Pornoraphic".
Beaucoup de photos en couleurs.
Ça ne vous dérange pas que
votre copine soit à Hawaii ?
Non, je sais que Consuela
m'aime toujours
et je veux qu'elle s'amuse.
Mais cette carte postale
m'a vraiment déchiré le cœur.
Des endroits que
je ne verrai jamais.
Il y a pire qu'une nana
qui part en vacances.
- Comme quoi ?
- Elle pourrait te quitter.
Elle pourrait t'envoyer
une lettre et te dire
que le moment est venu pour elle
de continuer sa vie.
C'que j'veux dire...
je pensais que le pire
qui puisse m'arriver,
serait de perdre mes jambes
et ma liberté.
Mais Annabella, c'est...
comme me faire castrer.
C'est une grosse
partie de qui je suis.
Si seulement je pouvais
vous comprendre.
Jaz Hoyt est encore au trou
à cause de ce Révérend Cloutier.
T'es au tri du courrier,
hein, Gunner ?
- Ouais.
- Super.
Sois sûr que ce soit bien toi
aujourd'hui qui fasses la distribution.
Sois sûr d'aller dans
la section hospitalière.
Une fois là-bas,
sèche Cloutier.
Comment ?
Il paraît que les grands brûlés
ont du mal à respirer.
- Voilà, Spaghetti.
- Ta gueule, connard.
Qu'est-ce que ça fait là ?
Je crois que Cloutier
a du courrier.
Agent !
Agent ! Agent !
Agent !
Salope !
Lâche-le !
OK, OK.
Regardez-moi.
Regardez-moi.
- Où est Gunner ?
- Au trou.
- Et Cloutier ?
- Vivant.
Merde !
Il faut que je le dise à Jaz.
- Viens là.
- Quoi, quoi, quoi ?
J'l'ai vu.
- Vu qui ?
- Cloutier.
Au trou, il m'est apparu,
d'un seul coup. En pleine forme.
- C'était un rêve.
- J'l'ai vu.
- C'est fou.
- J'l'ai vu, comme Jim Burns l'a vu.
Jim Burns est mort.
Tu l'as tué.
- On l'a tué.
- Bon, allez, calme-toi.
Va te faire foutre.
Éteins cette cigarette.
C'est bon, c'est bon.
C'est pas bon pour toi, Jaz.
J'sais bien.
Oh, merde !
Au secours !
Lopresti !
- Au secours !
- Ils ne peuvent pas t'entendre.
Je suis dans ta tête.
Je suis la culpabilité qui s'est
accumulée dans ton âme
depuis que tu as tué
ton premier chat.
Et j'irai nulle part,
à moins que...
- A moins que quoi ?
- Tu me rendes un service.
- C'que tu veux.
- Tue Timmy Kirk.
- Mais...
- Tue Timmy Kirk, Jaz.
Ou alors je te rendrai des visites
nocturnes pendant le restant de ta vie.
Éteins cette cigarette !
Le Dr Nathan dit que le Révérend
Cloutier se rétablit fort bien.
Il devrait pouvoir parler
dans quelques semaines.
Bonne nouvelle.
Ne vous moquez pas
de moi, Kirk.
Vous avez manigancé la tentative
de meurtre contre Cloutier.
Ça vous dit, une pipe ?
- Kirk !
- C'est quoi, ton problème ?
Qu'est-ce qu...
Hoyt ! Agent !
Arrête !
Oh, mon Dieu.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Pardonnez-moi
mes péchés, mon Père.
Faites une perfusion
à 20 milligrammes.
J'avoue le meurtre
de Jim Burns.
J'avoue le meurtre
de Ralph Galino.
J'avoue le meurtre
de Brian Lawlor.
J'avoue le meurtre
d'Adam Decoursey.
J'avoue le meurtre
de David Horton.
Gloria, Hoyt déclare que Cloutier
lui a demandé de tuer Timmy Kirk.
C'est impossible. Il bouge à peine
et ne parle presque pas.
J'en sais rien,
mais Hoyt est convaincu
que Cloutier lui a rendu
visite hier soir.
Hoyt essaierait de jouer la folie
pour éviter la peine de mort ?
Possible.
- Gloria.
- Oui ?
Où est-il ?
- Avez-vous déplacé Cloutier ?
- Non.
Il était là il y a une minute.
Il a disparu.
Lorsqu'ils ont ouvert le tombeau,
j'ai vu un jeune homme
assis à droite,
vêtu de blanc.
Et ils furent étonnés.
Il leur dit :
"N'ayez pas peur.
Vous cherchez Jésus de Nazareth,
celui qui a été crucifié.
Il est ressuscité".
Tout le monde a
ses propres problèmes
dans la vie,
mais si vous gardez vos rêves,
vous vous en sortirez.
A Oz, c'est le contraire.
Pour s'en sortir,
il ne faut pas avoir de rêves.
Une des consolations
pour tous les détenus,
c'est de savoir que 90%
des gens à l'extérieur
ne réalisent jamais leurs rêves.
Alors finalement,
on est pas si mal lotis que ça.
Vikings. Le mot seul
évoque des images
de hordes de soûlards, attaquant
et pillant des villages sans défense,
des côtes d'Angleterre
aux steppes de Russie.
On a beaucoup d'idées reçues
au sujet des Vikings.
Exemple : ils n'ont en fait jamais
porté ces casques stupides,
et parce qu'ils avaient peu
de terres à cultiver,
ils pillaient seulement
pour survivre.
J'veux être dans ton camp.
C'est toi la relève,
- et j'veux devenir ton lieutenant.
- Tue Guerra.
Putain, qu'est-ce
que tu fous, Jaime ?
Désolé, tu dois mourir.
C'est la vie.
Au moins fais-le de face.
Laisse-moi mourir comme un homme.
Comme tu dis, c'est la vie.
Mon Père.
J'aimerais me confesser.
Samedi, à 15h00.
Non, maintenant.
Fermez la porte.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Vous savez, depuis que
je suis sorti d'isolement,
j'me suis baladé
à gauche, à droite,
juste pour prouver à tout le monde
que j'suis pas une gonzesse.
Je comprends.
J'aurais dû mourir
dans cet accident de bus.
Et maintenant,
le Révérend Cloutier a...
disparu.
Je pense que ça veut dire
quelque chose,
mais je n'arrive pas à comprendre
ce que ce quelque chose peut-être.
- Alors, que faites-vous ?
- Je prie.
Tant que vous y êtes,
priez pour moi.
Je le fais toujours, Miguel.
Mais cette fois, j'en ai besoin
d'un petit peu plus que d'habitude.
Quelqu'un est mort
à cause de moi.
- Jaime Velez ?
- Ouais.
Ce gamin était innocent,
vous savez ?
Vous et moi avons eu une histoire
longue et difficile...
mais je continue à croire
que vous avez une bonne âme,
et que vous trouverez une façon
de réparer le mal que avez fait.
Et si j'le fais pas ?
Alors, vous êtes vraiment
une gonzesse.
Le problème dans notre État,
c'est qu'il y a plus de malvoyants
que de chiens guides,
mais il y a plus de chiens
que de gens pour les former.
C'est pourquoi j'ai créé ce programme
"Le Meilleur Ami de l'Homme"
où ce sont les prisonniers
qui dressent les chiens.
- Et ça a marché ailleurs, hein ?
- Oh, mieux que nous l'espérions.
Désolé, suis-je en retard ?
Elle est arrivée de bonne heure,
donc nous avons commencé.
Bien sûr, pourquoi m'attendre ?
Alicia Hinden,
Eleanor O'Connor,
- la liaison du Gouverneur.
- Enchantée.
Continuez, s'il vous plaît.
Avoir des prisonniers s'occuper
et dresser ces chiens
a donné d'excellents résultats.
60% des chiens sont
prêts à être placés,
90% des prisonniers font preuve
d'un meilleur comportement
après leur participation
au programme.
Le dressage de chien ne requiert-il pas
des aptitudes particulières ?
Tout à fait, mais elles peuvent
être enseignées.
Et les prisonniers
ne font pas de mal aux animaux ?
Nous étions inquiets
au début, mais en fait,
les chiens font ressortir ce qu'il y a de
meilleur en leurs éducateurs.
Les prisonniers apprennent
à s'occuper d'un être vivant.
Et pour eux, ça compte plus
que vous ne le pensez.
Pardonnez mon scepticisme,
Mlle Hinden,
mais je pense que nous devrions
commencer à une petite échelle.
Moins on a de personnes,
moins on a de chances de réussir.
Je ne dis pas que
ça ne marchera pas.
Non, vous dites simplement
qu'il ne durera pas.
- J'économise le temps et l'argent.
- C'est ça.
- Je t'emmerde, Tim.
- En fait, je préfère commencer petit.
Et bien, comme ça...
J'aurai juste besoin
de trois volontaires.
Laissez-moi savoir
si vous êtes intéressés,
mais n'oubliez pas
qu'il ne s'agit pas de jouer à la balle.
Vous devez être extrêmement
motivés pour participer.
Les candidats intéressés
devront subir un entretien,
et leurs dossiers seront épluchés
avant que soit rendue une décision.
J'veux pas d'chiens ici.
Y'avait un pitbull
où j'ai grandi,
une saloperie. J'suis sûr
qu'il avait du Schillinger en lui.
Il a bouffé un bout de ma jambe.
Quelque chose me dit que
t'as mérité de t'faire mordre.
Tu sais quoi ? Peut-être qu'un chien
me changerait les idées.
Je m'inscris.
Je pense que j'vais m'inscrire.
Je parie que c'est
des chiens renifleurs.
- Des chiens de flics ?
- On n'sait jamais.
Tu sais quoi, j'le fais.
Moi aussi.
- Ryan ?
- Ouais.
- On peut avoir un petit chien ?
- Cours toujours.
Entrez, et asseyez-vous.
Hé, ma fille, ouais.
Ouais.
T'as fait quoi pour te retrouver ici avec
cette bande d'abrutis ?
Miguel, j'ai jeté un œil
à votre dossier,
et j'vais être
honnête avec vous.
Vous n'êtes pas vraiment
fait pour ce programme.
- Pourquoi ça ?
- Vous êtes violent.
Vous avez lu que j'ai rendu l'agent
Eugène Riviera aveugle ?
Ça, j'ai pas pu le rater.
C'est pour ça
que vous devez me prendre.
C'est ce que je lui dois.
Ça m'paraît normal de faire ça,
après tout le mal que j'ai fait, non ?
Regardez.
Elle m'a déjà choisi.
Ouais, ouais, ma fille.
Voilà ma chienne.
Recule, si tu veux bien,
Penders.
T'auras ta chienne plus tard.
On n'est pas au chenil.
C'est moi qui te donnerai ton chien,
- et c'est ainsi que tu l'appelleras.
- C'est toi, la chienne.
Tout d'abord, je vais vous expliquer
ce que nous allons faire.
Le but est de leur apprendre,
tout comme à vous,
l'obéissance.
Donc, si on fait quelque
chose de mal,
vous nous tapez sur le pif
avec un journal roulé ?
S'il le faut.
Ce que vous apprendrez
au chiens :
viens, assis, pas bouger.
Les choses de base.
Mais plus important, vous leur
montrerez l'amour et la confiance.
Pour que ces chiens soient
utiles aux malvoyants,
il faut qu'ils soient à l'aise,
pas seulement avec leur propriétaire,
mais aussi avec n'importe qui.
Et si nous n'y arrivons pas,
tout ce que vous aurez fait, c'est élever un
animal de compagnie.
- Oui ?
- Ces chiens, ils restent avec nous ?
- Oui, dans vos cellules.
- Comment on les protège des autres ?
Comme je l'ai dit,
amour et confiance.
C'est comme les conjoints
et les cigarettes.
- Ce qui veut dire ?
- Deux choses qui n'existent pas à Oz.
Matez un peu. Ils ramènent
leurs nanas à la maison.
Ton petit bâtard
sait déjà ce qu'est la douleur ?
- Laisse-la tranquille, ducon.
- J'ferai pas d'mal à ton chien-chien.
J'crains plutôt
qu'elle te fasse mal à toi.
Viens, ma fille.
Vas-y. Rentre.
C'est ta nouvelle maison.
C'est la maison de ton papa.
Ouais, viens ici.
Les Vikings n'étaient pas tous
des brutes stupides.
Ils ont eu des moments brillants.
Ils étaient de tels marins
et constructeurs de bateaux
que Leif Eriksson et son équipage
arrivèrent en Amérique les premiers.
Certains disent même qu'ils sont allés
jusqu'à la baie de New York.
C'est là qu'on voit leur intelligence.
Ils ont jeté un œil,
et on fait demi-tour direct.
T'as envoyé 200 lettres
à la chaîne de télé
pour protester contre la suppression
de "Miss Sally".
Je voulais qu'ils voient l'ampleur
du phénomène, qu'ils comprennent
que le peuple souhaite
que l'émission continue.
- Toutes de la même adresse ?
- On a reçu celle-là aujourd'hui.
"Merci de votre courrier.
La diversité culturelle, blabla...
Malheureusement, le tournage
de 'Miss Sally' a été stoppé".
- Ça va me manquer.
- Attends.
"Je suis heureux de vous apprendre
que Whitney Allen apparaîtra
dans un nouveau feuilleton,
appelé 'Sallycise'.
Nous espérons que vous
l'apprécierez. Amitiés", etc.
Je me demande si ma Norma aura
un job dans la nouvelle série.
- Toujours pas de nouvelles, hein ?
- Non,
mais je garde l'espoir.
- Tu as parlé à ton fils ?
- Oui.
- Et ?
- Et il n'y a pas de "et".
Tu lui as dit que
tu comptes gagner au loto ?
Que tu utiliseras l'argent pour sauver
Alex de la leucémie ?
- Non.
- C'est pas pour ça que tu l'as appelé ?
Je ne devrais pas donner
de faux espoirs à la famille.
- Tu n'y crois plus ?
- Bien sûr que si.
Mon problème c'est que
je ne sais pas si l'agent Brass
a vraiment acheté
le billet pour moi.
Agent Brass ?
Agent Brass ?
- Agent Brass ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Rebadow ?
Vous avez acheté
mon billet de loterie ?
Quoi ? Ouais, ouais.
- Hé.
- Hé, que fais-tu ici ?
Je croyais que le directeur
t'avait affecté à la cafétéria.
Oui. C'est ma pause. Je voulais
voir comment vous alliez.
J'ai mes règles.
J'vais hyper mal.
Officier Brass,
ça fait plaisir de vous voir.
Ouais, pourquoi ?
Glynn ramène de plus en plus
d'officiers en chef nègres.
Pour moi, n'importe quel visage
pâle est un bon visage pâle.
J'voulais te demander un truc.
Tu étais là, le jour
où je me suis fait couper ?
Non, moi et Robson
on travaillait.
Si j'avais été là, je vous aurais
débarrassé de ce singe.
- Donc tu sais quel singe c'était ?
- Qui exactement, non.
Mais je vous garantis une chose.
C'était pas un blanc.
- Hé, Brass.
- Ouais ?
- Vous buvez ?
- Tu veux aller boire un canon ?
Que penses-tu d'un cocktail
sang-pisse-merde-vomi, enculé ?
Ce fils de pute !
- Ça va, Dave ?
- Ça va.
- Je peux y aller ?
- Oui, c'est bon.
Revenez dans une semaine
et on fera des analyses de sang.
C'est important
qu'on vérifie tout...
Hépatite, tuberculose, HIV...
Juste au cas où.
Dave.
Je me dis toujours que
ce n'est pas à moi de dire ça,
mais quand je pense à ce qui pourrait
arriver si je ne disais rien,
Vous avez une petite amie
ou un partenaire sexuel ?
- Kate.
- Dites-lui ce qui est arrivé.
Juste pour qu'elle sache.
Vous avez raison.
Ce n'est pas votre rôle.
- Hola, Dr Nathan.
- Hola.
Arrêtez ça.
Agent ?
- Y'a un problème ?
- Il devrait être à l'hôpital.
- Rien à faire.
- Je sais qu'il a attaqué un des vôtres,
mais je ne peux pas le soigner
comme il faut ici.
- Il faut que je vois avec le directeur.
- Alors allez-y.
Dépêchez-vous.
J'ai dit, arrêtez.
J'ai dit arrêtez !
Arrêtez ! Arrêtez !
Arrêtez ! J'ai dit arrêtez !
Ne me touchez pas !
Ne me touchez pas !
C'est quoi votre problème ?
Martinez n'arrêtait pas
de me toucher,
et j'ai eu des flash-back du viol
et puis j'ai perdu contrôle.
Ou peut-être
qu'à ce moment-là,
vous aviez en fait
repris le contrôle.
Peter Marie,
j'ai frappé un homme blessé.
Oui, je sais,
mais en le frappant,
vous aviez enfin
le contrôle de la situation.
Vous m'avez dit
à plusieurs reprises
que depuis le viol,
vous vous sentiez à la dérive.
Et peut-être que
l'incident d'aujourd'hui
était une tentative pour reprendre
les commandes de votre vie.
Tout ce qui m'arrive, c'est
des incidents comme celui-ci.
Êtes-vous en train de dire que
je provoque ces hommes exprès ?
Non, non, non,
mais je pense
que vous devez répondre à la question
que je vous avais posée.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi après avoir été
battue et violée
avez-vous choisi de retourner dans
un endroit rempli d'hommes brutaux ?
Je ne sais toujours pas.
Je pense que si l'on y travaille,
et si on trouve pourquoi,
vous pourrez enfin
commencer à cicatriser vos plaies.
D'après la mythologie scandinave,
l'homme vient d'un frêne
et la femme d'une vipère.
Le grand dieu Odin
leur a donné vie et âme
et un endroit où vivre
appelé Midgard,
qu'Odin a créé à partir des sourcils
d'un géant qu'il avait tué.
Ça sonne presque vrai, non ?
Nous vivrions tous
sur le rebord d'un sourcil.
L'homosexualité...
est une perversion
contre la volonté de Dieu.
Je suis d'accord.
Pourtant tu pratiques
la sodomie.
- J'suis pas un pédé.
- Tu as violé Beecher,
et Cyril O'Reily
et Dieu sait combien d'autres.
Je n'ai jamais touché personne.
Tu mens,
putain de suceur de bites !
- Tobias.
- Comment peux-tu nier ça ?
- Tobias ! Garde !
- Enlève tes putains de mains de là !
- Arrêtez !
- Vas-y !
Tu mens, putain de salope !
Tu mens, sac à merde !
Salut, Petey.
Tu vas chez le psy ?
C'est bien.
Après le traumatisme
que tu as vécu,
avec le viol et tout ça...
Non !
Ça fait du bien d'en parler.
Mais entre peut-être pas trop
dans les détails.
Ce n'est peut-être pas
si sain après tout.
Laisse-moi tranquille.
Bien sûr. Pour le moment.
Reste optimiste.
Bonjour, Chris.
Comment allez-vous ?
Vous savez, être seul
vous donne tout
le temps de réfléchir.
J'suis là, assis,
à penser à l'ironie,
l'ironie de ma vie.
Désolée de ne pas avoir convaincu le
directeur de vous laisser voir Beecher.
Il ne permet même pas
un échange de lettres.
C'était plus facile d'être séparés
quand j'étais dans le Massachusetts.
Savoir qu'il est
dans ce bâtiment...
Savoir qu'il est peut-être
derrière ce mur.
Vous aviez dit que
vous parleriez à un avocat,
que vous me trouveriez un avocat.
Je dois sortir blanchi de cette histoire
de meurtre, si je veux revoir Beecher.
Je devrais avoir
des nouvelles bientôt.
En attendant, gardez la foi.
La garder où ?
- Salut.
- Salut.
Quelle bonne surprise.
Mon portable ne marche jamais ici,
j'ai demandé à Sœur Peter Marie
si je pouvais utiliser son téléphone.
J'étais en train de parler à Freddy
Rudolf au sujet de cette audience
quand la Sœur a demandé si je pouvais
parler à un autre prisonnier.
Chris Keller.
Quoi ?
- Ne le fais pas.
- Pourquoi ?
- Ne le fais pas.
- J'ai entendu tellement d'histoires.
Catherine...
- Je t'aime.
- Et tu aimes Keller, pas vrai ?
Tu aimes toujours Keller, non ?
Si tu le vois...
Il est très séduisant.
Tu vas tomber amoureuse
de lui, toi aussi.
Je suis prête à prendre le risque.
De plus, je ne peux pas
manquer l'opportunité
de rencontrer le petit ami
de mon petit ami.
Voilà, Keller.
Je t'apporte tes bonbons,
ceux que tu as demandés.
Merci, Claire.
J'avais besoin
d'un petit quelque chose à sucer.
Si le directeur l'apprend,
il me bottera le cul.
Et quel cul.
- Vilain.
- Donne-moi la fessée.
Tu as une visite, Keller.
Bonjour.
Je suis Catherine McClain, de l'Alliance
pour les Droits des Prisonniers.
Sœur Peter Marie
m'a demandé de passer.
- Pouvons-nous être seuls ?
- Nous serons juste à côté.
Avez-vous tué
ces trois hommes ?
Vous allez droit au but !
Je n'ai pas beaucoup de temps.
Je n'ai que ça, moi, du temps.
Peut-être pas.
Vous risquez la peine de mort.
Je n'ai pas peur de mourir.
J'veux juste mourir
pour les bonnes raisons.
- Et ce serait...
- L'amour.
Nous avons un ami commun.
- Ouais, qui ?
- Tobias Beecher.
Attendez...
Je sais qui vous êtes.
Vous avez essayé d'aider Toby
pour sa liberté conditionnelle.
- Oui.
- Et il m'a parlé de vous.
Ouais, qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
- Il vous aime.
- Vous comprenez le dilemme, alors.
Si vous passez à la chaise,
vous n'êtes plus qu'un souvenir.
Si je vous aide,
vous et Toby serez réunis.
Donc maintenant, je sais que
vous ferez tout pour m'aider.
- Et pourquoi ça ?
- Si vous aimez Toby autant que moi,
vous le voulez heureux.
Nous réunir le rendrait heureux.
Ouais.
Maître.
- Avez-vous tué ces trois hommes ?
- Non.
- J't'emmerde !
- Tais-toi, merde !
Espèce de chienne !
Matricules 02G561
et 02W562,
Adam Guenzel
et Franklin Winthrop,
condamnés le 14 janvier 2002
pour viol et tentative
d'assassinat.
Verdict : 28 ans,
dont sept ans fermes.
OK, allons-y.
Allez !
Viens par ici, mon petit !
Celui-là, c'est le tien.
C'est la première fois
que j'aurai à faire mon lit.
Adam, crois-moi,
rien de ce que tu as vécu à Brown Park
ne t'aura préparé à la vie à Oz.
Je sais que c'est dur,
mais je serai là pour toi,
je promets.
Ton père était mon chef scout,
quand même.
Il faut que tu comprennes
quelque chose.
Cette fille que Franklin et moi
avons violée...
nous étions saouls,
nous faisions la fête.
J'ai disjoncté.
J'ai jamais voulu lui faire de mal.
Ouais, mais tu l'as fait.
C'est pour ça que t'es là.
N'oublie jamais ça, jamais.
La culpabilité
te gardera peut-être sain d'esprit.
Ouais.
Installe-toi,
et je te ferai visiter l'endroit.
Tu as besoin d'un coup de main,
mon mignon ?
T'as déjà sucé une bite ?
Dégage, Clarence.
OK, Vern.
Pas besoin de s'énerver.
Ça va ?
Il allait me violer.
Putain de nègre.
Nous te protègerons
à partir de maintenant.
Super, merci.
Mais comme pour tout
dans la vie...
ça va te coûter.
Si tu as un problème
avec l'alcool,
tu devrais suivre
la thérapie de Sœur Pete.
Oh, il est chaud !
- Putain de merde.
- Quoi ?
Tu te souviens de ce pote Franklin
Winthrop dont je te parlais ?
- Ouais.
- C'est lui.
Franklin.
Ton gars est le prochain.
Merde !
J'ai besoin de ton aide pour protéger
Adam des Aryens.
J'peux pas.
Comment ça,
tu peux pas ?
Beecher...
quand j'ai poignardé Schillinger
et Robson pour te défendre,
j'ai mis beaucoup de mes frères
musulmans en danger.
Je ne peux pas
faire ça une deuxième fois.
Sûrement pas pour un gars
qui viole et bat les femmes.
Je sais.
Adam n'est pas un ange,
mais je le connais
depuis qu'il est petit.
Je connais sa famille. J'peux pas justifier
ce qu'il a fait, mais...
Beecher, arrête.
Ma réponse est non.
- Alors ?
- Ça ne va pas marcher.
Merde !
OK, voilà ce qu'on va faire.
En attendant, va
voir McManus et demande-lui
- de te placer en isolement.
- Jusqu'à quand ?
Jusqu'à ce que je trouve
une autre solution.
Merde.
C'est pour moi.
Dégagez-le.
Matricule 02U672,
Francis Urbano,
alias Frank le Combinard.
Condamné le 7 janvier 2002
pour assassinat.
Sentence : la prison à vie,
dont 25 ans fermes.
Sœur Peter Marie voulait que
je dépose ceci pour le Dr Nathan.
Pancamo,
t'as mauvaise mine.
J'ai la fièvre ou
un truc comme ça.
Tu peux m'donner de l'eau ?
Ouais.
Je sais que tu hais les Aryens
autant que moi, pas vrai ?
Plus.
Ces putains de Nazis
m'ont tabassé
et ont violé Peter Schibetta.
J'ai un pote qu'ils
ont menacé de violer.
Je me demandais
si tu pouvais le protéger.
- Beecher, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Rien.
- Va le faire ailleurs.
- Oui, monsieur.
- Qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?
- D'accord.
Merci.
J'aime les hommes qui suent.
- Laisse-le tranquille.
- Reste en dehors de ça.
Il y a deux solutions, fillette :
bats-toi ou baise.
Les deux finissent de la même
manière : ma bite dans ton cul.
Pas forcément.
Putain, t'es qui ?
Qui je suis ?
- Petite merde.
- J't'emmerde !
Comment va ta cicatrice,
sale porc ?
Fermez la zone !
- Mec, j'ai eu trop peur.
- Je sais.
Il y avait des bras et des jambes
et des couteaux partout !
Bon, c'est fini maintenant.
Mon Dieu, je ne savais
plus où aller !
J'étais chaud !
Une partie de moi voulait
en tabasser quelques-uns.
- Adam.
- J'aurais pu, tu sais.
J'aurais pu
en tabasser un ou deux !
Putain !
Les Vikings avaient un code d'honneur
qu'ils suivaient à la lettre :
honneur et bravoure
sur le champ de bataille
étaient les valeurs
qu'un guerrier s'efforçait d'atteindre.
Mais comme les hommes d'Oz, ils ne
connaissaient ni le bien ni le mal.
Ils ne pouvaient pas
faire la différence.
Ils ne savaient pas
qu'il devait y en avoir une.
J'ai entendu ce
qui s'est passé. Ça va ?
- J'vais bien.
- C'est bien.
Entrez.
J'ai rencontré votre mère.
Ouais, je sais.
Elle m'a dit.
Elle a l'air sympa.
Elle est complètement différente
de la femme qui m'a élevé
et dont je pensais
qu'elle était ma vraie mère,
mon autre mère,
la mère de Cyril, Tessie...
C'était son prénom, Tessie.
Tessie pleurait tout le temps.
Elle avait une bonne raison.
Cyril et moi,
on ne lui a jamais donné
une raison de sourire.
- C'est fou.
- Quoi ?
Maintenant que ma mère est ici,
à faire une peine d'intérêt public...
Elle, et moi, et Cyril,
c'est comme si on était
une famille. C'est super.
Ryan, lui avez-vous parlé
de ce qui s'est passé
entre vous et moi,
Cyril, mon mari... Keenan ?
Non. J'veux dire,
elle m'a demandé mais...
- Vous devriez, non ?
- Pourquoi ?
Quel bien ça lui ferait
de savoir ça ?
Vous ne pouvez pas lui montrer
seulement le bon côté de son fils.
Écoutez, Gloria,
je suis à Oz.
Je ne crois pas que ma mère
me voie comme un saint.
Si vous souhaitez avoir
une vraie relation avec elle,
vous devez lui dire
toute la vérité.
Je ne peux pas.
- Pourquoi pas ?
- Parce qu'elle ne m'aimera plus.
Je ne crois pas.
Mon expérience me dit
que l'on n'aime pas
Ryan O'Reily par choix.
Détends-toi.
Des voitures ?
Pas mal, gamin.
Ne ris pas,
au moins j'essaie.
Ouais, il a raison.
Je ne te vois pas faire d'effort.
J'ai plus d'un tour
dans ma poche moi aussi.
Vraiment ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Tu verras.
Maman, j'veux
te demander quelque chose.
Tu crois qu'on doit être à 100%
honnête dans une famille ?
Ouais.
Ce que je veux dire, c'est que si ton
père et moi avions été honnêtes,
si nous avions été ouverts et avions
essayé de régler nos problèmes
et toutes nos peurs,
peut-être que je ne serais pas partie.
Je me demande comment aurait été
ma vie si vous étiez restés mariés.
N'idéalise pas trop
les choses non plus.
Ça aurait été
vraiment difficile.
Je sais,
mais nous aurions été...
ensemble.
Ouais.
Quand on aura fini
notre leçon,
je te raconterai des trucs
que j'ai fait, tu sais,
depuis que je suis à Oz.
Et je veux juste...
te prévenir, maman,
ce n'est pas joli.
Je m'en doute.
Mais c'est bien, parce que
si tu me le racontes, peut-être
que ça t'aidera à comprendre.
Ouais.
Alors... qu'est-ce que tu as ?
- C'est un petit quelque chose.
- Fais voir.
C'est super !
- Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour-J.
- Ouais.
Tue-les tous les deux,
mais si tu ne peux
en avoir qu'un, tue Ryan.
On peut se faire le mongol
une fois que l'aîné sera mort.
Shupe.
- Hé, O'Reily.
- Pas maintenant, Shupe.
- C'est important.
- OK, tu as 10 secondes.
J'ai entendu Li parler à Jia.
Ils se disputaient à propos de ta mère.
- Quoi ?
- Li disait qu'il allait la violer.
Merde.
- T'as ma came ?
- Ouais.
Ryan, est-ce que ce mec
va faire du mal à maman ?
Jamais de la vie, Cyril.
Alors comme ça, tes mecs vont
s'en prendre à ma mère, hein ?
Il n'est pas maître de lui.
- Je ne sais pas quoi faire.
- Ben moi je sais.
J'vous dis,
il allait violer ma mère.
- Vous en avez la preuve ?
- Demandez à Jia.
- Il sait.
- Je lui demanderai.
- En attendant, Cyril va en isolement.
- Non !
Li est le dernier d'une longue liste
de gens que Cyril a eus.
Je le veux là où il ne fera
de mal à personne.
Il est à vous.
- Ryan ?
- Tout ira bien, Cyril. Tout ira bien.
- Allez-y mollo avec lui.
- Je veux pas y aller !
- Allez, viens !
- Je suis désolé.
- Bande d'enculés !
- Économise ta colère.
Cette fois, on va aller plus loin.
Cyril finit à l'asile
ou dans le couloir de la mort.
Et tu vas dans la cage.
Allez, viens. Allez, O'Reily.
Ma Sœur,
vous devez me croire !
Vous savez, c'est possible
qu'il dise la vérité.
O'Reily ? La vérité ?
J'en doute.
J'vous en prie.
J'suis désolé, j'suis désolé !
Je ne veux pas
aller là-dedans.
Non ! Non !
S'il vous plaît,
je suis vraiment désolé !
S'il vous plaît, non !
J'suis désolé !
J'suis désolé !
J'suis désolé.
J'suis désolé.
Jia, Jia, viens ici.
Hé viens ici.
Tu dois aller voir McManus et lui dire
que Li allait violer ma mère.
- J'ai rien à dire.
- Jia, allez !
Tu dois faire ça pour moi, mec !
Tu dois lui dire.
Ton frère va mourir.
Ils vont lui griller le cul,
et je serai assis
au premier rang
à m'éclater le bide,
sale connard.
Quoi ? Sale jaune !
Tu me fais marcher ?
Putain t'es mort, Jia !
T'es mort, putain de petite salope
de bouffeur de riz !
T'es mort !
T'es mort, putain d'enculé !
- Tu voulais me voir ?
- Oui, M. le Directeur.
Bel endroit que vous avez là.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux,
Redding ?
Le contrôle de la cafétéria.
Les Siciliens
font marcher la cafétéria.
Ouais, mais Chucky Pancamo
est toujours à l'hôpital.
Pete Schibetta est en psy.
C'est un bazar monstre.
Tu penses pouvoir remettre
l'opération en marche ?
La plupart de ces gars
sont mes amis.
La plupart sont noirs
et ils n'aiment pas
obéir aux ritals.
J'ai laissé Adebisi
s'occuper de la cafétéria.
- C'était une catastrophe.
- J'suis pas Adebisi.
La vérité, c'est qu'il y a
eu pas mal de merdes
depuis l'explosion de gaz.
D'accord, Redding,
j'te donne une chance.
- Agent.
- Autre chose.
J'apprécierais si vous pouviez faire
dégager les Siciliens de là.
Bien sûr.
Merci infiniment.
Augustus, Augustus...
Augustus,
où est ton chien ?
Dans ma cellule.
J'me sens pas de jouer pour l'instant.
- Tu penses à ta mère ?
- Ouais.
Ça prendra plus que quelques
semaines pour oublier sa mort.
Ce n'est pas ce
que je voulais dire.
J'peux toujours la voir,
en train de se demander
ce qui se passait alors que le bus faisait
des tonneaux.
être prise au piège.
Ça lui faisait peur.
Maintenant elle est coincée pour
toujours dans un cercueil.
- Il faut que tu voies plus loin.
- J't'emmerde, Beecher.
Je sais ce que tu ressens.
J'ai enterré mon fils.
Ça va sembler bizarre,
mais tu dois travailler
ces images.
Tu l'as déjà déplacée
du bus vers la tombe.
Continue. Imagine son corps
se décomposer sous terre.
- Dégage de ma...
- Écoute-moi.
Imagine ta mère
en train de se décomposer,
les vers en train de manger sa chair,
laissant seulement les os.
Tu dois entendre
ce cercueil craquer,
sentir la poussière tomber
à travers les fentes.
Et pourquoi
voudrais-je faire ça ?
Pour laisser ta mère partir.
Pour l'instant, tu la vois morte.
C'est la seule façon d'oublier
l'horreur de ce qui s'est passé,
et de penser à elle
comme à un bon souvenir.
J'peux pas, putain !
Je ne vois que ce putain de bus !
- Casse-toi, Beecher !
- Augustus.
Casse-toi, putain !
C'est pas vrai !
Donne-moi cette merde.
Ouais.
Ouais, laisse-le entrer.
Donne-moi quelque chose.
- Comme ça ?
- Ouais.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi changer d'avis ?
J'ai besoin d'un lot
de consolation.
T'es de retour au club.
Ouais, mon pote,
cet enculé ne s'est pas shooté
depuis des années.
Ouais.
Ouais, voilà.
Vas-y. Ouais.
- Je dois chanter comme ça ?
- Non, Omar.
Je veux juste que vous vous amusiez
autant que moi.
Je ne pensais pas
un jour dire ça, mais je m'amuse.
- Vraiment.
- Tant mieux.
Les dernières leçons
étaient super !
J'veux dire,
elles ont secoué !
C'est fini.
- A plus.
- OK.
Entraînez-vous.
Comment ça va ?
Omar, Omar, Omar,
la leçon est finie.
J'ai une chanson dans le cœur.
Tu m'en veux pas, hein ?
Tout ce que je te demande,
c'est que tu la gardes dans ton cœur.
White, je peux
t'en suggérer une autre ?
Ouais, qu'est-ce que
tu veux entendre ?
Ferme ta gueule.
Je ne me battrai pas.
Je ne me battrai pas.
Voyons si tu peux chanter
maintenant, enculé.
- Laisse-le tranquille.
- Sinon quoi ?
Assez dansé comme ça.
Ça suffit.
Dites à ce pleurnicheur
de fermer sa putain de gueule.
Dégage de là maintenant !
Bouge !
Merci de m'avoir défendu.
Reste tranquille, Omar.
Attends, laisse-moi te dire
quelque chose.
Pour la première fois de ma vie,
les ennuis et moi ça fait deux.
- Et Guerra ?
- Il m'a sauté dessus.
- Tu l'as vu.
- Ne montre pas du doigt.
La responsabilité est
sur tes épaules...
et donc sur les miennes,
et je refuse ça.
J'ai dit que j'allais m'entraîner.
La pratique me rendra parfait.
Alors quand les ennuis
arrivent, cours.
Ça ne va pas aider
ma réputation à Oz.
La seule personne que ta réputation
concerne, c'est moi.
Aussitôt que tu oublies ça,
tu retournes en isolement.
Maintenant, tu me comprends ?
Tu me comprends ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Omar White.
Il suit les ordres
sans trop se plaindre.
J'ai réussi
à le garder sobre.
Chanter semble lui avoir
donné un centre d'intérêt.
- C'est que...
- Il te rend fou ?
Non, mais il se ramasse pas mal de
merde de la part des autres détenus.
Ils le harcèlent, et pourraient l'agresser,
McManus.
Mon champ d'intervention
est limité.
Il n'a nulle part où pratiquer,
à part dans ma cellule.
- C'est là qu'il te rend fou ?
- Oui.
Je ne sais pas s'il y a
d'autres possibilités.
Je le soutiendrai
autant que je peux,
- mais je dois prier en silence.
- OK, OK.
Laisse-moi y réfléchir, OK ?
Merci.
Omar.
Allons faire une promenade.
- J'ai merdé ?
- Non, ce n'est pas ça.
Alors j'ai entendu dire
que tu chantes.
Ouais, qui l'aurait pensé, hein ?
J'suis Omar "Barry" White.
- Voulez entendre quelques notes ?
- Pas maintenant.
En fait, Omar, personne
ne veut t'entendre.
Attendez, là...
D'abord vous m'encouragez
à faire c'te merde,
- et maintenant, il faut que j'arrête ?
- Suis-moi.
Vous allez où ?
Vous n'allez pas me coller...
Calme-toi,
on y est presque.
C'est quoi, putain ?
Hé, McManus,
j'fais pas ces merdes,
d'accord ?
Oh non, pas encore passer la serpillière
et toutes ces conneries ?
Omar, si tu pouvais juste
la fermer une seconde,
je crois que tu serais content.
Oh merde.
J'y crois pas.
Tu t'entraîneras ici
une heure par jour.
Vous êtes cool, McManus.
Vous êtes un mec bien, mec.
Ouais, ouais,
j'suis un mec bien...
J'ai appris que tu avais
ta cabane privée.
Tu es prêt à me faire
une petite passe ?
Passe ? Passe quoi ?
Comme quoi, vendre de la drogue ?
Non, non, j'peux pas.
J'peux pas risquer ça
maintenant.
Tu vois...
ce n'est pas la réponse
que j'attendais de ta part.
Alors voilà comment
ça va marcher.
Je vais te donner
la dope,
tu la donnes
à mon pote Reggie,
et il l'amènera au bloc C.
Et si tu as un problème avec ça,
tu auras un problème encore
plus gros avec moi.
J'vais te le demander
une fois de plus,
est-ce que tu vas faire
cette passe pour moi ?
Merde, merde.
C'est bon, c'est bon.
Prends ça.
Omar,
si j'apprends
que tu en as pris,
il ne restera rien de toi,
même pour nettoyer le sol.
Crois-moi, Redding,
cette fois je veux rester net.
Ouais, ben,
les miracles existent...
- C'est toi, Reggie ?
- Tu croyais que c'était qui,
- Destiny's Child ?
- C'était une question rhétorique.
Si rhétorique veut dire con à chier,
alors t'as raison.
T'es pas doué en bavardage.
- Les affaires sont les affaires.
- Ouais, ben...
les loisirs, c'est mieux.
A plus, rhétorique
de mes deux.
Red...
Bon boulot.
Qu'on ne dise jamais que
je n'aime pas l'art et la culture.
Oh la la !
Dure journée au boulot, Jack.
Et toi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Omar...
S'il te plaît.
Quoi ?
Tais-toi.
J'essaie de me relaxer,
- c'est tout.
- Fais ça en silence.
Putain, quoi ?
C'est quoi ton problème ?
Quelque chose
que j'ai fait ou quoi ?
Omar, tu es mon plus
grand souci,
mais tu n'es pas le seul.
Alors, je t'en prie !
Laisse-moi en paix.
D'accord.
Bonjour, Imam.
Vous vous préparez pour
le sermon de demain ?
Non.
Musique et théorie ?
Correct.
Et nous, Imam ?
Je sais que notre foi
n'empêche pas
l'amélioration d'autrui,
mais ça oblige
notre meneur à mener.
Nous pensons qu'Omar White
devient une distraction.
"Nous" ?
Lalar, tu es d'accord ?
- Écoutez...
- Ahmad, te sens-tu à la dérive
maintenant que j'ai pris quelqu'un
d'autre sous mon aile ?
Imam, je...
C'est pas mignon, ça ?
Les trois petits cochons
font la causette.
Lalar, arrête !
Maintenant.
Arif, on y va.
J'espère que t'es vexé.
Dans le Serengeti,
d'où viennent tous ces négros,
tu sais comment on envoie
un message au meneur du groupe ?
On tue le plus jeune
et le plus faible du troupeau.
J'ai vu ça dans
des émissions animalières.
Je pense qu'il est temps
que l'on ouvre la chasse.
Les Vikings devinrent civilisés,
devinrent chrétiens.
Ce sont aujourd'hui les Danois,
les Norvégiens, les Suédois.
Ce qui est ironique, c'est que
malgré leur gène guerrier,
la Norvège donne aujourd'hui
le Prix Nobel de la Paix.
Je suppose qu'un peuple
peut changer
s'ils s'y mettent tous ensemble.
Bon boulot pour un négro.
Comment te faire confiance
avec toute cette marchandise ?
Comment savoir
si tu n'en voles pas ?
Je suppose qu'on devrait
t'ouvrir et vérifier.
Non, il n'y a rien.
Peut-être dans son bras.
Peut-être.
Et de deux.
Lalar,
j'te conseille
de te mettre à l'aise.
Ça pourrait prendre du temps.
Les gens aiment se faire dire
la bonne aventure.
Ils se font tirer les cartes,
lire les lignes de la main
et męme les bosses sur le crâne.
Pourquoi s'intéresser ŕ une carte,
si ce n'est pas une carte de crédit ?
Si la main est vide,
laisse tomber la neige,
si vos bosses sur la tęte sont
si grosses qu'on peut les lire,
votre avenir est mal barré.
Vos problčmes sont ici
et maintenant.
Ahmad Lalar a été assassiné
par James Robson.
C'est ce que tu répčtes, mais
tu n'apportes aucunes preuves.
Il me faut un témoin,
une arme du crime, n'importe quoi.
Robson n'a peut-ętre pas
commis le meurtre lui-męme.
Il l'a peut-ętre fait exécuter par un des
Aryens, comme pour Salah Udeen.
Cela va ętre difficile de l'inculper.
- Qu'allez-vous faire, alors ?
- Poursuivre l'enquęte.
Vous faites traîner l'enquęte,
en espérant que tout le monde oublie.
Écoutez-moi, M. le Directeur.
Nous n'oublierons pas.
La mort de Lalar
ne doit pas rester impunie.
Elle ne le restera pas.
Robson va payer, crois-moi.
- Et cela, trčs bientôt.
- Courrier !
T'as le courrier
pour Imam Said ?
Tu sais, Omar,
ton Imam et moi, avons
quelque chose en commun.
Et alors ?
On est pour l'esclavage.
L'esclavage n'existe plus,
selon moi.
Ce qui est dommage.
Mais ŕ en croire
certains bouquins,
les musulmans
pratiquent l'esclavage
en Afrique.
C'est une réalité.
Et Said le sait,
puisqu'il s'est dégoté
son propre esclave.
Toi.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
J'suis l'esclave de personne.
Ramasse le coton,
nettoie le sol.
- T'es son esclave de service.
- Fils de pute !
Omar, viens par ici !
J'dois pas m'battre,
d'accord,
mais personne
me parle comme ça !
Viens tout de suite !
T'as entendu ça ?
Putain !
J'suis ton esclave !
Putain !
C'est nul.
Qu'est-ce qu'il faisait lŕ ?
C'est juste un admirateur.
Un trafiquant de drogue, oui.
Il a juste entendu la musique
et il est entré.
Omar...
Tu vends de la drogue ?
Non.
Vends-tu de la drogue ?
Oui, voilŕ.
Ça t'convient ?
C'est bon, j'en pends pas,
d'accord ?
Tu crois quoi ?
- C'est ce qu'on avait décidé.
- Pas du tout.
Dealer, c'est se droguer.
Pas si on en croit
mon analyse d'urine.
Je me moque de ça.
C'est ce que je dis qui importe.
Ah bon ?
Et j'te dis : "Va te faire foutre".
Écoute : "Va te faire foutre".
Va te faire foutre !
Vas-y, Said, arręte...
Enculé ! Enculé !
- Au secours !
- Enculé ! Enculé !
- Enculé ! Enculé !
- Au secours !
J'attends.
Quoi ?
Des explications.
A propos de quoi ?
A propos de cette raclée.
Une explication changera
quelque chose ?
J'l'ai tabassé !
J'ai tout laissé tomber...
- lui et moi.
- Tout allait si bien.
- Pourquoi tu ne m'en as pas parlé ?
- Vous ne pigez rien, McManus.
Tout ce que je veux,
c'est une explication.
En attendant, tu moisiras ici.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ?
J'sais pas pourquoi
ce fils de pute
- s'est jeté sur moi !
- Il te tabasse sans raison ?
OK, voilŕ la vérité.
Mais gardez ŕ l'esprit
que ce que je vais vous dire
est la seule et unique vérité.
Compris ?
Je dealais un peu.
Tu te fous de ma gueule ?
De ta salle de répétition ?
C'est pas si simple.
On me menaçait.
J'ai rien fait de mal.
Je jure que j'ai rien pris.
Tu deales pour qui ?
Si je parle,
j'suis un homme mort.
- Sérieux.
- OK.
Oublie.
J'ai rien fait, promis.
- J'ai rien fait.
- La ferme !
Ferme-la, bordel !
Pour une fois.
Je vous en prie,
ne me remettez pas
en isolement.
J'ai pas le choix, Omar.
Voilŕ ce qu'on va faire.
A partir de maintenant,
tu répčtes dans ta cellule.
Oublie la salle de répétition.
Et si on trouve ne serait-ce que de
l'aspirine dans ton urine, t'es foutu.
Tu me comprends ?
C'est bon.
Messieurs.
Notre Imam est
au trou par ta faute.
Cet enfoiré est au trou
parce qu'il est ŕ la rue
avec ses histoires de leader.
T'es vénéneux, White.
T'as réussi ŕ te mettre ŕ dos
la seule personne qui t'aidait.
Nous, on a vu ça venir de loin.
Chaque jour que Said
passe dans le trou,
c'est un jour oů tu es tout seul.
Et, alors ?
Je dois répéter.
Putain !
J'ai horreur de ta voix.
McManus.
Ça va ętre l'extinction des feux.
T'es pas dans ta cellule ?
Oů vous allez ?
Au trou ?
Parce que j'pourrais peut-ętre
y aller avec vous,
histoire de voir comment Said
gčre la situation.
Tu t'en moques, non ?
J'ai un peu de difficultés.
Des difficultés ?
Je suis perdu dans la nature.
On me traite pas trčs bien
en ce moment.
Sans Said...
c'est pas vraiment facile.
J'ai besoin de lui.
Vraiment.
En route.
- On retourne ŕ Em City.
- Et si je veux pas ?
Tu serais le premier.
J'suis pas pręt.
Je ne le mérite pas.
Omar m'a expliqué
ce qui s'est passé.
Ouais...
mais j'ai quand męme perdu
mon humanité
ŕ la recherche de ce
que je pensais ętre le bien.
Tu sais, Said,
je ne pense pas que tu aies
perdu ton humanité.
Tu as peur parce
que tes actions
sont humaines.
Allez, en route.
McManus, soit je retrouve
mon âme dans cette cellule,
soit je suis perdu pour toujours.
Donnez-moi plus de temps,
je vous en prie.
S'il vous plaît.
C'est fou.
Trčs bien.
Fais-moi savoir
quand tu es pręt.
Et ensuite
on te ramčne ŕ Em City,
avec ton pote Omar White.
Qui devient "voyant" ?
Des bonnes femmes
pas trčs futées
qui vous prédisent les trucs
qu'elles auraient voulu
qui leur arrivent.
Elles inventent vos ręves
parce que les leurs
ne se sont pas réalisés.
Ça vous fait quoi, hein ?
D'avoir votre futur...
prédit par quelqu'un
qui n'en a pas ?
Docteur.
C'est quoi mon problčme ?
J'ai chaud, ça me gratte,
j'ai la colique.
J'ai bien peur que vous ayez
une septicémie.
Quand une plaie s'infecte,
des toxines peuvent
se diffuser dans le sang,
- atteindre des tissus et...
- Ça explique tous ces médicaments.
Les antibiotiques, oui.
Mais votre organisme
semble leur résister.
Et j'ai attrapé ça ŕ l'hôpital ?
Oui.
J'vais mourir ?
Nous faisons tout ce qui est
en notre pouvoir, d'accord ?
- Et je suis sűre que...
- Me laissez pas mourir.
J'veux pas mourir.
J'veux pas mourir
dans ma merde.
C'est pas possible.
J'ai la gaule rien qu'en la matant.
Remets-les en place, salope.
Il paraît que Pancamo
a chopé un truc comme la grippe.
- Il pourrait en mourir.
- Bonne nouvelle.
S'il n'en meurt pas,
on s'occupera de lui
ŕ sa sortie.
Avec Schibetta en psychiatrie
et Urbano au trou,
les Siciliens ne sont plus
les maîtres de la cafétéria.
Ils ne font plus les mariolles.
En attendant,
on a d'autres chats ŕ fouetter.
Tu sais quoi, ma puce ?
J'aime les culs bien durs.
Tu vas aller faire de la muscu.
Oui, chef.
Et si tu vois ton pote
Adam Guenzel,
donne-lui des infos
intéressantes.
A propos de quoi, chef ?
A propos de son pote
Tobias Beecher.
Ça s'est bien passé
avec tes parents ?
Elle a pas arręté de pleurer.
C'était trop gęnant.
Estime-toi heureux d'avoir
quelqu'un qui pleure pour toi.
C'est bon.
Arręte.
- Vas-y, arręte.
- Laisse tomber.
- Vas-y.
- J'vais soulever un peu.
Faut que je te fasse revenir ŕ Em City
avant d'aller bosser avec Sśur Pete.
- Je peux me débrouiller.
- Oui, mais...
Il faut que je commence
ŕ me débrouiller seul.
Trčs bien.
- Salut, beau gosse.
- Ta gueule.
C'est quoi ton problčme ?
J'suis lŕ ŕ cause de toi, OK ?
- J'voulais pas violer cette nana.
- Tu t'es vu ?
- T'as vu ce que tu es devenu ?
- Je veux rester vivant.
Mais moi je ressemble pas
ŕ une poupée Barbie.
Parce que t'es avec Beecher.
Il paraît que tu paies le męme prix
- que moi pour ta protection.
- C'est des conneries !
Tout le monde sait que Beecher
est une grosse tante,
et que tu lui suces la bite.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes,
ducon ?
Vas-y, enculé !
Espčce de tarlouze !
Taré !
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Winthrop me cherchait.
Il fallait que j'le calme.
- Vous n'ętes pas amis ?
- Plus maintenant.
Étant donné que c'est
ta premičre altercation,
je vais laisser couler.
Mais c'est juste une fois, compris ?
Oui, monsieur.
Il t'a tiré les oreilles ?
Comme tu l'avais prévu.
Tu veux pas
aller au trou, Adam.
On m'a déjŕ fait la morale
aujourd'hui, OK ?
T'es sűr que ça va ?
Vire tes sales pattes !
Je voudrais revenir
sur notre derničre séance,
quand on parlait
de l'homosexualité.
J'avais dit
que je ne t'avais jamais
rien fait, Beecher.
En fait,
j'ai eu peur de parler.
Vous savez,
je craignais
qu'en parlant trop,
j'aurais pu
subir des sanctions
disciplinaires
ou męme juridiques.
Je t'ai fait subir des sévices
ŕ ton arrivée.
J'en suis désolé.
Je te demande pardon.
Tobias...
acceptez-vous ses excuses ?
Je...
J'en sais rien.
Alors comme ça, le FBI a autorisé
le Procureur ŕ vous poursuivre.
- Pourquoi ?
- Un témoin s'est présenté
et dit vous avoir vu vous
débarrasser du corps de Tibbetts
dans un champ,
prčs d'Alden.
Mais le FBI ne peut pas vous
inculper, car il ne peut pas prouver
que vous avez transféré Tibbetts
d'un état ŕ l'autre.
Admettons que je me sois
débarrassé du corps.
Ça ne veut pas dire
que j'ai tué le gars.
Tout ŕ fait.
Pour vous éviter la peine de mort,
je vais devoir mettre ce doute
dans l'esprit des jurés.
- Vous dites que vous ne l'avez pas tué.
- Oui.
- Que faisiez-vous avec son corps ?
- Ce n'était pas moi.
Pourtant le témoin vous a reconnu
parmi d'autres individus...
Catherine, ce n'était pas moi.
Et le témoin dit que c'était le soir,
n'est-ce pas ?
Il n'y a pas de lumičre le soir.
Mais cet enculé a des yeux
bioniques, peut-ętre ?
Je vois que vous n'avez pas
besoin de moi, Keller.
Vous pouvez plaider vous-męme.
- Vous ętes plus belle que moi.
- Pas vraiment.
La parution est demain.
Pręt pour un petit tour en ville ?
Moi, partir d'ici ?
J'suis pas sűr.
Agent ?
A demain matin.
Vous allez voir Toby ?
Oui.
Dites-lui que j'ai ręvé de lui.
Il était élu président.
J'ai ręvé de nous deux.
Et ?
Nous étions gladiateurs.
Tu t'appelais Sextus.
Et moi, Cunnilingus.
Ça fait vraiment
du bien de te voir.
Tu l'as dit.
J'ai parlé avec Holly
ce matin.
Elle s'est vraiment bien amusée
avec toi et ton fils
au Parc de l'Aventure.
Elle est vraiment gentille.
Ça s'est passé
comment avec Keller ?
Bien.
Bien.
On est en train de bâtir
une solide défense.
Il ne t'a jamais parlé
de ces meurtres ?
Non.
Tu ne mentirais pas
pour le protéger.
Non.
Trčs bien.
A plus.
Catherine.
Keller t'aurait pas donné
un message pour moi ?
Non.
On peut faire ça
de deux façons, ma puce.
Elles se terminent toutes les deux de la
męme maničre : ma bite dans ton cul.
Beecher, il faut que je te parle.
- Écoute...
- J'voulais pas en parler en séance.
J'ai essayé de convaincre Robson
de ne pas violer ton pote Guenzel.
Mais tu sais que Robson est tętu.
Les Siciliens l'en ont empęché,
j'en suis content.
Tu en es content ?
Pas vraiment content.
J'suis comme toi.
J'suis bouleversé.
J'essaie de mettre
de l'ordre dans ma vie,
mais tu sais comment c'est ŕ Oz...
J'peux pas faire grand chose.
Mais je fais de mon mieux.
J'ai entendu parler
de ce qui se passe.
Le directeur ne t'autorise pas
ŕ voir Keller.
Pendant que je livre le courrier,
je te propose de...
d'amener ŕ Keller
une lettre de ta part.
Tu ferais ça ?
Vraiment ?
Tu l'écris, je la dépose.
J'suis...
Quoi ? Etonné ?
Choqué ?
Méfiant.
Tu as toutes
les raisons de l'ętre.
Mais j'te jure
sur la tombe de mes deux fils,
j'essaie juste de me rattraper
pour ce que j'ai fait...
d'apaiser ma conscience
pour pouvoir tourner la page.
Salut, Keller.
Mon vieux pote, Schillinger.
J'ai un paquet
d'une de tes anciennes femmes,
une demande de réabonnement
pour "Sport Illustrated",
et ça de la part de Beecher.
A quoi tu joues ?
A rien.
Si tu veux, demain je prendrai
ta lettre pour Beecher.
Extinction des feux !
Adam ?
Ça va ?
T'as rien dit de la soirée.
T'étais déjŕ pédé
avant d'arriver ŕ Oz
ou t'as commencé ici ?
Quoi ?
J'ai entendu des histoires ŕ ton sujet.
Elles sont vraies ?
Ça dépend de ce
qu'elles racontent.
Tu étais la salope de Schillinger
ŕ ton arrivée.
- Oui.
- Et t'es devenu la salope de Keller ?
Pas vraiment sa salope.
Quoi ? Sa fiancée ?
Les gens simplifient
toujours les choses.
T'es une tante
ou t'en n'es pas une.
Et si t'en es une,
t'aurais dű m'le dire
au lieu de te la jouer normal,
en prétendant que tu t'intéressais
ŕ moi pour les bonnes raisons.
Adam, mes raisons sont saines.
- Recule !
- Sois pas casse couilles.
Ça t'plairait, hein ?
D'me bouffer les couilles ?
Ferme ta gueule !
Casse-toi, putain de tarlouze !
- Arręte !
- Lâche-moi !
- Arrętez ça tout de suite !
- J'veux pas de cette tante !
Cette pédale m'a touché.
Je ne veux plus
partager sa cellule.
D'accord. Mais comme toutes
les cellules sont pleines,
et comme tu as besoin de te calmer
un peu, je te mets dans la cage.
Moi ? J'ai fait que dalle !
Lâche-moi, enculé !
Il va pas bien.
Il viole une fille, la tabasse.
Je sais.
Ça fait longtemps que
je connais la famille d'Adam.
C'est pour ça que
tu es son sponsor.
Mais je crois que j'ai fait une erreur
en l'amenant ŕ Em City.
- Je devrais le transférer.
- Non.
Je peux le faire changer.
- Laissez-moi essayer.
- Je te donne une chance.
Tapette.
Tapette.
Tapette.
Tapette.
Tapette !
Tapette !
Tapette !
Tapette...
J'peux t'arranger
un rencard avec Keller.
Et comment ?
Travaille pour moi ŕ la poste.
Je te laisserai distribuer le courrier
en détention provisoire.
Et laisser Sśur Pete ?
Si nécessaire.
Et je peux voir Keller ?
Tous les jours.
D'accord.
Une chose en échange,
par contre.
Quoi ?
Le môme.
Tu m'donnes le môme.
Quoi ?
Dis aux Siciliens
de me le laisser.
De lui faire ce que je veux.
Tout ça pour ça ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Du style "je veux changer".
Tu sais quoi ?
Je t'ai presque cru.
Ah bon ?
C'est pas la question.
J'offre une solution
ŕ ton problčme.
Tu veux, afin que j'obtienne
ce qui me tient le plus ŕ cśur,
que je t'aide ŕ faire
subir ŕ Adam
les horreurs que tu m'as fait endurer ?
Pas question.
Męme pas pour Keller ?
Męme pas pour Keller.
Je dois admettre
que cela m'étonne.
J'admire ta force de caractčre.
Je respecte ta décision.
On s'en tiendra lŕ.
Tu ne t'en tiens jamais lŕ.
Personne ne change
du jour au lendemain.
N'oublie pas de manger
tes légumes.
Qui peut ętre sűr
que le futur
n'est pas en train de déconner
avec la voyante ?
Si elle vous dit que
vous allez tomber amoureux,
elle ne vous dit pas, par contre,
que celle que vous aimez va mourir,
qu'elle est la sśur inconnue
que vous recherchez
depuis des années,
et aussi un tueur en série.
Parce que la voyante
ne sait rien de tout ça.
Et si Dieu, ou les esprits,
ne lui racontaient en fait
qu'une partie de l'histoire...
qu'une partie de la vérité ?
- Putain de vendredi.
- Putain de vendredi ?
Tu crois que j'serais heureux
de voir le week-end arriver ?
A Oz, je ne me sens jamais
plus niqué que le vendredi.
Jour de paie.
J'appellerais pas ça une paie.
On gagne une misčre.
Un salaire pour lequel ces charlots
du Congrčs ne travailleraient pas.
- Mieux vaut en rire.
- Tu suis le basket ?
- Le basket ?
- Ouais.
Qui est le pire joueur de la NBA ?
Un blanc.
En fait, ils sont deux ou trois blancs
ŕ se battre pour le titre.
Ça doit te prendre la tęte
de voir ces guignols
jouer en pro
- alors que tu es meilleur qu'eux.
- Pourquoi ça me prendrait la tęte ?
Tu sais qu'il faut ętre super fort
pour ętre le joueur
le moins bon en NBA ?
Je sais bien.
Ce que je veux dire, c'est que
le pire joueur de NBA
se fait quand męme un minimum
de $330 000 par an.
Moins les impôts,
les 4°/% pour ton agent,
et au pire, tu te retrouves
avec $160 000.
Męme 150, ou 140.
Tu peux męme te branler
avec $10 000.
Il te reste $140 000 net !
Du calme, Dave.
J'voulais pas t'énerver.
C'est pas ta faute.
C'est vendredi, c'est tout.
Les résultats
d'analyse sont bons.
On les refera dans trois mois.
Et les résultats de Martinez ?
Il n'a pas le SIDA,
si c'est ce qui vous inquičte.
Mais ce n'était peut-ętre pas
son sang qu'il vous
a flanqué ŕ la figure.
Pourquoi tu m'as fait ça, enfoiré ?
Parce que c'est toi l'enfoiré.
Arrętez tout de suite !
Alors vous pouvez
le frapper, mais pas moi ?
Agent Brass ?
Agent Brass ?
- Quoi ?
- Vous avez acheté mon billet de loto ?
Quoi ?
Ouais, ouais.
C'est bientôt, je suis impatient.
Pas toi, Bob ?
Impatient ŕ propos de quoi ?
La cagnotte de deux millions
qui aiderait ŕ trouver
un remčde pour ton petit-fils.
Comment ne pas ętre impatient ?
Et si Dieu ne m'avait pas
donné les bons numéros ?
Et si je ne gagnais pas ?
Alors Alex mourrait.
Les numéros seront
choisis au hasard,
parmi 51 boules numérotées
qui tombent de la sphčre.
Alors préparez-vous tous,
car c'est le moment du loto !
Si votre numéro est choisi,
vous pourriez ętre l'heureux vainqueur
des deux millions de dollars.
Le premier numéro est le sept.
Sept, Bob, c'est bon.
Le second numéro est
le 10.
Ça fait deux.
Trois.
Le quatričme numéro est...
le 49.
Quatre sur quatre.
Le cinquičme numéro est...
le 30.
Et le dernier numéro,
et le vainqueur des deux
millions de dollars est...
le 51.
Putain, c'est pas possible.
Nom de Dieu, j'ai gagné !
- T'as gagné ?
- Putain, que oui !
J'y crois pas !
J'y crois pas !
J'y crois pas !
C'est trop bon !
Incroyable !
C'est fou.
OK, c'est bon.
C'est bon.
Oui.
Rebadow nous a pris la tęte
toute la journée.
Il dit que ce n'est pas Brass
qui a gagné au loto, mais lui.
Ah bon ?
Faites-le entrer.
- Bob.
- Il faut que je parle ŕ l'agent Brass.
- Ça fait...
- Du calme, du calme.
7, 10, 3, 49, 30, 51,
ce sont mes numéros.
J'ai demandé ŕ l'agent Brass
de m'acheter le ticket.
Bob, le fait de retenir les numéros
gagnants ne prouve...
Si vous ne me croyez pas,
demandez ŕ l'agent Brass.
- Tu es sérieux ?
- Sur la tęte de mon petit-fils.
Écoute, Bob.
Dave Brass n'est pas ici.
En fait, quand il a gagné,
il a disparu.
Il n'est pas retourné ŕ son casier,
n'a pas pointé.
Vous ne pouvez pas le trouver ?
Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
Vous passez devant une vitrine
et une voyante
vous attire ŕ l'intérieur.
C'est une arnaque,
mais vous y allez quand męme.
Elle commence
ŕ vous tirer les cartes,
et vous vous dite alors :
"C'est des conneries".
Et pourtant elle dit la chose
que vous attendiez.
Vous devenez alors plus attentif,
espérant qu'elle connaisse
vraiment la vérité.
J'arrive tout droit du travail.
Je suis gardien
de prison ŕ Oswald.
Ou plutôt, je l'étais.
J'ai démissionné !
J'ai gagné !
Tim, t'as eu
des nouvelles de Brass ?
Personne n'a eu de nouvelles.
Que ce soient ses amis
ou sa fiancée.
Il a quitté le centre du loto,
a sauté dans un avion,
destination inconnue.
Merde.
J'étais avec Brass
pendant le tirage au sort.
Il a pété les plombs
quand il a gagné,
comme on le ferait tous.
Mais quand j'y repense,
il a peut-ętre marmonné entre ses dents :
"Niqué, Rebadow".
Pour ętre honnęte,
si cela avait été un autre gars
et si j'étais Brass,
je l'aurais niqué aussi.
Mais faire ça ŕ un type
comme Rebadow.
Vous savez que son petit-fils
est mourant.
C'est pas quelque chose de facile.
Brass était un bon gars.
Pas si bon que ça,
apparemment.
Jouer au basket avec lui
m'a permis de mieux le connaître.
C'est le gars le plus réglo et correct
que j'aie jamais rencontré.
La preuve que deux millions
peuvent changer un homme.
C'est pas ŕ cause de l'argent.
Il se sentait niqué.
On lui a mis un gros chčque
de la NBA devant lui,
et on lui a dit : "Non, non,
tu vas bosser ŕ Oz.
On va te couper le tendon
d'Achille sans raison
autre que McManus
ne sait pas la fermer".
Vous allez vous en vouloir
toute votre vie ?
Ouais.
Dave Brass a postulé
de lui-męme ŕ Oz.
Personne ne l'a forcé.
Il s'est fait bousiller
la jambe, dommage.
Mais c'est un centre de détention
de haute sécurité.
Il s'est fait balancer de la pisse
ŕ la figure et peut choper le SIDA.
Ça serait pire
que d'ętre boiteux.
Mais vous savez quoi ?
Il a postulé pour le poste.
Tim, chaque soir
je m'agenouille et prie Dieu
de ne pas me faire tuer au boulot.
Et si un jour ça arrivait ?
Et si un de ces monstres
décidait me m'enfiler par-derričre ?
Vous vous en voudrez de m'avoir engagé ?
Et c'est le cas,
vous ętes un abruti.
J'ai postulé ŕ ce poste.
Il fait frais aujourd'hui.
Ne m'en parlez pas.
Si j'avais une fourrure comme celle
de vos chiens d'aveugles...
- Chien-guide, c'est mieux.
- Quelle est la différence ?
Vous travaillez pour le Gouverneur.
Vous savez ce que c'est
qu'ętre politiquement correct.
Oů en est votre programme ?
C'est un véritable testament en faveur
du meilleur ami de l'homme.
J'ai trois des plus disparates détenus
que je n'aie jamais eus,
et ils font un travail
extraordinaire.
Je suis trčs impressionnée.
Les sceptiques
le sont en général.
Je vous vois plus tard.
Salut, Layla.
Il fait chaud ce matin.
Layla.
Layla.
Il a une septicémie et un problčme
rénal. Et il vient de perdre conscience.
Sa température
est enfin descendue.
C'est quoi ? Un virus ?
Est-ce contagieux ?
Non, c'est une infection.
Les paraplégiques ont
de fréquents problčmes rénaux,
particuličrement quand ils ne prennent
pas soin d'eux-męmes.
Augustus fait
trčs attention ŕ lui-męme.
- Il y a autre chose.
- Quoi ?
On recule tous,
le poignet rigide...
Putain, c'est quoi ce truc ?
Le nouveau feuilleton
de Miss Sally, "Sallycise".
- C'est sur la santé et l'exercice.
- Un de mes muscles
- grossit déjŕ.
- Et Hill ?
Augustus va s'en sortir ?
Alors ?
Il a fait une overdose ?
McManus, comment va Augustus ?
Comment va-t-il ?
Fils de pute.
Tu veux me parler de ça, non ?
Je sais rien du tout !
Dites-moi comment il va !
Il est en train de mourir, allongé
dans un putain de lit d'hôpital.
Et pourquoi vous voulez
me parler ?
Qui lui a donné cette drogue ?
Je ne sais rien du tout.
Vous devez me croire.
- Et pourquoi ?
- Je vieillis.
Je devrais déjŕ ętre mort.
Une chose est sűre, c'est que
je ne toucherai jamais ŕ ce môme.
Occupez-vous de lui,
et je vous promets
de trouver qui lui
a refilé cette dose.
Et quand tu le trouves,
tu me l'amčnes direct.
- Burr, comment il va, le môme ?
- Tu l'approvisionnes ?
Il a eu une overdose ? J'croyais
que c'était un truc aux reins.
Grâce ŕ des fils de pute
qui lui ont filé la came.
Et t'es mon suspect numéro un.
Quoi, moi ?
Ça va pas, non ?
Je te promets que
je trouverai la vérité.
Continue ŕ chercher,
mais j'ai rien fait.
Tu sais que t'as
beaucoup d'ennemis, Burr ?
Avant d'accuser tes potes,
va voir chez les Siciliens
et les métčques.
C'est c'que tu devrais faire.
Matricule 97P528,
Greg Penders,
condamné le 7 mai 1997,
homicide involontaire.
Condamné ŕ 17 ans
de réclusion criminelle,
dont neuf ans fermes.
- Vous ętes au courant ?
- C'est dommage.
Augustus se débrouillait bien
avec Layla.
C'est pour quoi faire, les steaks ?
Pour la leçon d'aujourd'hui.
On va apprendre
aux chiens ŕ cuisiner ?
Vous allez leur apprendre
la maîtrise de soi.
Il est primordial que
l'attention de votre chien
reste rivée sur vous,
męme lorsqu'ils sont tentés
par ces choses
qu'en tant que chien,
ils adorent.
De la putain de viande.
Ou des chats,
ou d'autres chiens.
Vous deux, allez lŕ-bas.
J'y crois pas.
Ça fait six ans que
j'ai pas vu un steak,
et maintenant vous les mettez par terre
pour que le chien le mange pas ?
Miguel, tu commences.
Laisse Julie te mener
en direction du steak.
Et si elle veut le manger ?
Tu tires fermement sur la laisse
et tu dis : "Non".
Non !
Julie, non !
Gentille.
Viens.
Julie, non !
Julie !
Non !
Et merde !
Ça va prendre du temps.
Mignon.
Mes parents m'ont offert un chien
quand j'avais neuf ans.
Un superbe épagneul.
Un jour, je lui ai fait
une ablation de la queue.
Une ablation ?
- Amputation.
- Pourquoi ?
Pour le look.
J'ai pris le couteau de cuisine
et lui ai coupé la queue,
les oreilles,
et je ne me suis pas arręté.
Quand mes parents sont rentrés,
il y avait du chien mort
un peu partout.
Vire tes pattes de mon chien.
- Je plaisante.
- Je m'en fous.
Vire tes sales pattes.
Obéis, Jia.
Un de ces jours, Morales.
Un de ces jours.
Tu me protčges maintenant ?
C'est juste que je hais
ce bouffeur de riz.
Et j'ai une question.
T'as été proche de Mukada ?
De temps ŕ autre.
- J'me demandais...
- Quoi ?
Oů se trouve son bureau ?
C'est ouvert.
Enrique.
- C'est une surprise.
- A qui le dites-vous ?
Sympa ici.
Alors ?
J'ai électrocuté
un mec un jour.
C'est pour ça que je suis lŕ.
Je lui ai foutu le cul
sur un transfo.
Et il s'est mis ŕ me supplier.
C'est ses pleurnichages
qui m'ont fait perdre les pédales.
Et vous vous sentez coupable.
Ça va pas, non ?
J'me disais,
je suis le dernier
ŕ avoir entendu sa voix,
je possčde ses derniers mots.
Je ne vous suis pas.
Vous possédez ceux de ma sśur,
et je veux les récupérer.
En effet, nous avons échangé quelques
mots avant que le bus n'ait l'accident.
Elle a dit qu'elle vous
aimait beaucoup,
- qu'elle était impatiente de vous voir.
- Moi aussi je l'étais.
Avec son sourire... C'était le visage
craché de notre mčre.
Dites-moi, mon Pčre,
Annette est-elle
morte heureuse ?
Elle en avait l'air.
A part les problčmes
liés ŕ son mariage.
- Elle avait des problčmes ?
- Vous ne le saviez pas ?
Quelle sorte de problčmes ?
Je ne connais pas les détails.
Vous devriez demander
ŕ son mari.
Ouais.
C'est ce que je vais faire.
T'as meilleure mine ici
que dehors.
Toi, tu ressembles
toujours ŕ rien.
Ça pas été facile,
avec l'enterrement et tout ça.
Et comment tu te sens,
sans Annette ?
Pas trop mal.
Elle et moi, on était...
T'inquičte pas, je sais.
C'était une connasse.
Tu sais pas le bien que
ça me fait de t'entendre dire ça.
J'voulais pas venir te voir
et te mentir ŕ propos d'Annette.
Tout ŕ coup, elle a voulu
devenir mannequin, tu sais ?
Elle se baladait ŕ South Beach,
en montrant ses seins
ŕ tous les photographes
de la ville.
Si elle dépassait les bornes,
fallait la remettre en place.
Elle mettait ces trucs
pas plus gros qu'un élastique.
- Tu sais c'que j'ai fait ?
- Non.
Je lui ai entaillé le bras.
Aprčs ça, elle mettait
des manches longues, la salope.
- Ça l'a calmée.
- Tu rigoles ?
Elle écartait les jambes
pour tout c'qui bougeait.
Et parfois,
męme c'qui bougeait pas.
J'aime pas manquer de respect...
Tu sais quoi, Javier ?
T'as plus ŕ t'en faire.
Ma sśur était une sainte,
enculé de ta race !
Fils de pute !
- Enculé !
- Lâche-le !
- Fils de pute !
- Lâche-le !
Bâtard !
Mon Pčre ?
Mon Pčre, approchez,
s'il vous plaît.
Il paraît que vous avez été transféré
de nouveau de Benchley Memorial,
pour vous remettre
de votre coup de couteau.
Oů se trouve Hoyt ?
Il a avoué plusieurs meurtres.
Il sera transféré chez
les condamnés ŕ mort.
Mon Pčre,
je souhaite me confesser
également.
Je souhaite de nouveau
ętre catholique.
Non.
Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce...
Vous ne pouvez pas refuser.
Oh que si !
Bienvenu chez
les condamnés ŕ mort.
Avant, pour savoir ce que
l'avenir vous réservait,
vous ameniez votre agneau
chez la sorcičre du coin,
qui le découpait en entier,
et lisait dans ses entrailles
encore fumantes.
A partir de cela,
votre avenir se dévoilait.
Grâce ŕ une femme sans dents,
atteinte de cataracte,
qui regardait votre bétail
se vider de son sang.
A mon avis, tout ce que vous faisiez,
c'était perdre un agneau,
ce qui n'aidait pas
beaucoup l'avenir.
Non !
Espčce de porc !
Non !
Ses crises de violence
sont plus nombreuses.
Il est impliqué quotidiennement
dans des bagarres.
L'assommer de calmants
n'est pas la solution.
Alors sortez-le d'isolement.
Ça le rend fou.
Redonnez-le moi.
J'ai essayé,
mais le directeur refuse.
- Pourquoi ?
- Votre frčre a tué Li Chen.
C'était de la légitime défense.
Il allait violer ma mčre.
Vous ne pouvez pas le prouver.
Et Jia nie vous avoir parlé.
Bouffeur de riz.
A cause de cet enculé,
Cyril risque la peine de mort.
Si seulement on pouvait trouver quelqu'un
qui confirme votre histoire.
Putain, mais y'a quelqu'un.
Avec tout ça, j'ai complčtement
oublié Glen Shupe.
Il a entendu Li menacer ma mčre.
Je vais le dire ŕ Leo.
Il faut en prendre tellement soin.
C'est comme du cristal,
vous savez.
Aussi fragile.
Quoi ?
Le bonheur.
Avez-vous, oui ou non,
dit ŕ Ryan O'Reily
que Li Chen allait
violer sa mčre ?
Non.
Ramenez-le ŕ Emerald City.
- Je veux ętre en détention provisoire.
- D'accord.
Leo, c'est évident qu'il ment.
Il a parlé de Li Chen ŕ Ryan.
Ce n'est pas ŕ moi d'en décider,
Peter Marie.
C'est le boulot du jury.
Vous avez intéręt ŕ expliquer
ŕ Cyril O'Reily
qu'il a besoin d'un bon avocat.
Ça va pas ętre facile.
Les nombreux épisodes
de violence de Cyril,
le décčs d'Hamid Khan,
Jia Kenmin dans le coma,
plus de nombreuses bagarres.
Tout cela va jouer en faveur
du procureur.
Et ma Sśur, si on en croit
vos analyses,
- il connaît le mal du bien.
- En effet.
Comme je disais,
ça ne va pas ętre facile.
- Je m'occuperai de l'affaire.
- Vraiment ?
Mais ŕ votre place, M. O'Reily,
je choisirai quelqu'un
avec un nom.
Comment ça, avec un nom ?
Un avocat qui peut tout remuer,
quelqu'un qui utilisera l'état
mental de Cyril en sa faveur,
qui mettra l'affaire
ŕ la une des médias.
- Vous ne pouvez pas faire ça ?
- Pas aussi bien que certains.
Il vous faut Barnum
et F. Lee Bailey,
Johnnie Cochran,
Ken Starr...
- Ces types sont hors de prix.
- Oui.
En fait, la question pour vous
et votre famille est de savoir
combien vaut la vie
de votre frčre.
- Tout ça est de ma faute, alors ?
- Mais non.
Tu as essayé de me prévenir,
et je ne t'ai pas écouté.
Ce n'est pas de ta faute. Le fait est que ta
présence nous a fait du bien.
Il faut maintenant trouver un moyen
pour qu'il échappe ŕ la peine de mort.
Faisons ce que cette femme propose.
Prenons un avocat célčbre.
- Tu as l'argent ?
- J'ai des économies.
Ça ne suffira pas.
As-tu parlé ŕ ton pčre,
ŕ ta tante ?
- A quoi ça servira ?
- J'en sais trop rien.
Mais ils méritent
d'ętre au courant.
Il faut une réunion de famille.
Toi et papa ?
Dans la męme pičce ?
- Oui.
- L'as-tu vu récemment ?
Je n'ai pas vu Seamus O'Reily
depuis 30 ans,
mais je ne vois pas
de meilleure raison
pour lui faire baisser le regard.
J'en sais rien.
Salut, papa.
Tante Brenda.
Comment vas-tu ?
J'ai amené des biscuits.
Les préférés de Cyril.
J'lui donnerai, merci.
Assieds-toi.
Suzanne.
Brenda.
Je t'en prie, Seamus,
on a fait tout ce trajet...
fais deux pas de plus.
Je ne mordrai pas.
Promis.
Depuis quand
tu tiens tes promesses ?
Allons droit au but.
Je vous ai expliqué les détails
au téléphone.
Je veux juste savoir...
Peut-on se permettre d'engager
le meilleur avocat pour défendre Cyril ?
- Combien ?
- $20 000 d'entrée.
- Mon Dieu.
- Aucun de nous n'a autant d'argent,
męme en empilant
toutes nos pičces de monnaie.
Brenda, je me souviens
de ton accident du travail
et du chčque que la compagnie
a dű te signer.
C'est ce avec quoi je vis.
C'est tout ce que j'ai
pour mes vieux jours.
Ne demande pas ŕ Brenda de risquer
son avenir ŕ cause de Cyril.
Elle dit qu'elle l'aime.
- Je l'aime, oui.
- Mais pas assez.
Et pourquoi ta mčre n'a pas demandé
ŕ sa famille de nous aider ?
Tu sais tout comme moi
qu'ils m'ont déshéritée.
C'est vrai, ils t'ont déshéritée.
Mais pas parce que tu as quitté
ton mari et tes enfants, ça non.
Pour avoir flingué ce flic.
Et pour avoir couvert
ton pčre de honte,
cet enculé !
J'ai assumé
mes responsabilités, Seamus.
C'est peut-ętre ton tour
maintenant.
J'ai assumé mes responsabilités
il y a 32 ans !
En mettant de la nourriture
dans leurs assiettes,
en payant le loyer,
en les torchant !
Et oů étais-tu, bordel ?
Je voudrais te demander
une chose, Seamus.
Et dis-moi la vérité
pour la premičre fois dans ta vie.
Toi et Tessie vous ętes vite mis
ensemble aprčs mon départ.
Et vous avez eu Cyril
un an aprčs qu'on ait eu Ryan.
- Et alors ?
- Alors tu la baisais derričre mon dos ?
Ouais.
Je la baisais męme
le jour oů Ryan est né.
Ça suffit maintenant !
J'vous en prie.
Nous parlons de Cyril,
d'accord ?
Putain, j'y crois pas,
on est en train d'essayer
de sauver sa vie.
On s'en fout de ces conneries.
Tu as tort, Ryan.
Ces conneries
sont ŕ la base de tout.
Tu dis qu'on doit le sauver.
Pourquoi ?
La perpétuité ŕ Oz,
avec son esprit un peu simple ?
Peut-ętre que la meilleure
des choses
que l'on puisse faire
pour ce gamin
est de le laisser mourir.
Quoi ?
Allez, Seamus,
ramčne-moi ŕ la maison.
Brenda, ne t'en va pas,
s'il te plaît.
S'il te plaît.
Il y a plus que ça.
Dans une famille, il y a plus
que le sang, Ryan.
Plus que les repas de Noël
et les gâteaux d'anniversaire.
Plus que les vieilles blessures
et les rancunes.
Nous ne sommes pas une famille.
Nous ne l'avons jamais été.
Tu as frappé
ŕ la mauvaise porte.
On se voit dans 30 ans,
vieille conne.
Je suis désolée pour tout ça.
Ça va aller.
En fait, ça s'est mieux
passé que prévu.
Eh bien.
Ryan.
Elle a tort, tu le sais.
Elle a tort.
Parce que toi, et moi, et Cyril,
nous sommes une famille.
Eux, ils sont usés et fatigués.
Mais nous, on va s'en sortir.
Mais Brenda a raison
pour une chose.
Le mieux que l'on puisse faire
pour Cyril est de le laisser mourir.
Oh merde.
Salut, Ryan.
Salut, gamin.
Attends, attends.
- Ça va aller.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
J'ai encore été méchant ?
Oui.
- Désolé.
- C'est pas grave.
On peut repartir ŕ Em City,
maintenant ?
J'ai bien peur que tu ne retournes
en isolement cellulaire, Cyril.
- J'aime pas l'isolement cellulaire.
- Je sais.
Ça fait peur.
On est seul.
Si je pouvais prendre ta place,
je le ferais tout de suite.
Ryan ?
Tu pleures ?
Non.
Les garçons ne pleurent pas.
C'est vrai.
Papa disait toujours :
"Les garçons ne pleurent pas".
Et qui sait mieux que papa ?
Pousse-toi, O'Reily.
Tu vas ętre calme, maintenant ?
Oui, monsieur.
Finalement...
malgré les voyantes,
des diseuses de bonne aventure,
des tarots,
des planches ouija...
Votre vie est votre putain de vie.
Écoutez ça.
Il y a une personne dont le métier
est de prédire l'avenir,
et il raison dans 100% des cas.
Qui est cet enculé de magicien ?
On s'appelle le Juge.
Et nous tous ŕ Oz,
on s'est fait lire
la bonne aventure.
Et croyez-moi, l'avenir...
il est pas rose.
Ton visage.
C'est rien, ça.
T'aurais dû me voir
il y a quelques jours.
T'aurais été fier.
J'en suis pas fier, Omar.
J'en suis désolé.
Moi aussi.
J'ai merdé, je le sais.
Si je te dis pourquoi
je vendais de la came,
- t'iras pas le dire à McManus, OK ?
- T'as ma parole.
C'est Redding qui m'a forcé.
J'ai essayé de lui dire non à ce connard,
mais y avait rien à faire.
Et moi, je suis trop crétin pour que
tu viennes me demander de l'aide ?
Tu m'as dit que j'en avais besoin
pour me remettre d'aplomb.
Merde, j'aurais méme eu besoin
du traitement Ike Turner.
Bon, je suis désolé, tu es désolé,
on tourne la page, d'accord ?
Tu veux savoir l'ironie et le ridicule
dans tout ça, Omar ?
C'est moi qui étais accro.
- Quoi ?
- Accro au pouvoir.
Défoncé 24h sur 24,
7 jours sur 7,
à vouloir contrôler
ton rétablissement.
Le pouvoir...
C'est une drogue aussi malsaine
qu'une autre.
Écoute, j'aimerais que tu m'appelles...
Kareem.
Va pour Kareem.
Merci.
Je crois que vous allez étre
agréablement surpris par le spectacle.
Et le clou de la soirée,
ce sera Omar White.
- Il est si doué que ça ?
- Je n'ai pas dis ça.
J'ai simplement
plus de fierté pour lui
parce qu'il a vraiment investi
son cœur et son âme
dans ce spectacle.
Ce sera déjà une victoire
s'il arrive à monter sur scène.
Qu'il chante bien ou non
n'a aucune importance.
Est-ce que je peux faire
quelque chose ?
Puisque vous vous proposez,
nous avons besoin
d'un présentateur.
Pas question.
Je ne suis pas très doué
pour esquiver les tomates.
Vous croyez que je plaisante ?
La foule du Colisée de la Rome Antique
était plus clémente.
Demandez à Mukada,
au moins il a Dieu de son côté.
Vous étes une poule mouillée.
Quoi ?
Merde, je mue ou quoi ?
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
avec du travail vous y arriverez.
Bon, allons-y.
Donnez-moi une minute,
d'accord ? Merde.
Y a personne qui me regarde
et je suis déjà complètement flippé.
Omar, vous vous débrouillez très bien.
C'est naturel d'avoir le trac.
Je me débrouille bien,
ça veut dire que je suis foutu.
Merde.
Ils vont me bouffer tout cru
ces enfoirés.
Enfoirés !
Je les vois déjà
en train de se foutre de ma gueule.
Répétez après moi.
Merde.
- Quoi ?
- Merde.
- Merde.
- Je les emmerde.
Dites-le.
Je les...
Dites-le.
Je les emmerde.
Très bien, je vous remercie.
Bon, allons-y.
Je peux te parler
une seconde, Poet ?
J'ai besoin d'un petit conseil.
Toi tu montes sur scène,
devant tout le monde,
et tu récites tes poèmes.
- Ouais.
- J'ai ce spectacle à faire.
Je suis mort de trouille.
Viens, assieds-toi,
Poet va t'expliquer.
Assieds-toi.
Je vais t'expliquer.
Comment tu fais pour monter
sur scène comme ça ?
T'es là, calme et sûr de toi,
fier comme un pape.
Facile.
Un petit coup de défonce dans
les coulisses, ça le fait toujours.
Je peux pas toucher à ça.
Pourquoi pas ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Parce que McManus et Said
te l'ont défendu ?
Je vais te dire un truc, cousin.
Je les connais ces deux-là,
j'y suis passé.
Said m'a raconté les mémes conneries,
que je deviendrais un symbole.
Un phoenix renaissant
des cendres de la came
pour m'envoler sur les ailes
de la poésie. C'est des conneries.
J'essaie juste de survivre
la guerre, hé ouais.
Alors quand je monte sur scène
et que je balance des rimes,
c'est ma façon de me battre.
Et quand je me défonce,
c'est ma façon
de panser les blessures.
Au cas où t'aurais
besoin du remède,
prends ça, tu me renverras
l'ascenseur un jour.
Au cas oû, d'accord.
Souviens-toi d'une chose.
Tous les yeux seront sur toi.
Ma sœur est tellement grosse
qu'on ne différencie plus
le devant du derrière.
Elle ne peut monter dans un ascenseur
que pour descendre.
Merci, vous étes magnifiques.
- Bon sang, c'est un public difficile.
- Agamemnon Busmalis !
Je vous dirais bien d'imaginer
qu'ils sont tous nus,
mais vous avez déjà dû les voir nus,
pour la plupart.
Et enfin, Omar White.
Omar, t'es nul à chier !
- Tu jubiles.
- Pas du tout.
Mais si. Tu attends
des excuses pour avoir dit
que tu pariais toujours sur l'impossible
et que tu perdais.
Tu veux que je t'aide ?
- J'avais tort...
- Timmy, tu es vraiment mignon.
- J'avais tort...
- Très peu d'hommes approuveraient
notre "Star Academy en prison".
D'accord, je jubile,
mais laisse-moi profiter un peu.
Omar White était une cause perdue,
et je n'ai pas laissé tomber.
Je suis resté à ses côtés,
et tu sais quoi ?
Ça rattrape
tout ce qui n'a pas marché,
d'en voir un seul s'en sortir.
Tu repasses toujours
tes chemises toi-méme ?
Je sais ce que tu penses.
Tim adore les causes perdues.
J'adore quand tu essaies de deviner
ce que je pense. Essaie encore.
Quoi de neuf, mon pote ?
Poet connaît le remède.
Poet connaît le remède.
J'ai changé d'avis.
J'en ai pas besoin
de cette merde, cousin.
J'ai failli craquer,
mais je me suis dit :
"C'est pas le moment de t'abrutir,
fie-toi à ton instinct".
Tu déconnes ?
Tu te fous de ma gueule ?
Non, c'est la came
qui se fout de ta gueule.
Avec tout le respect
que je vous dois Imam Kareem,
je vous répète
que vos fréquentations nous inquiètent.
J'y suis presque ?
C'est ce que je pensais.
Avec tout ce qu'Omar White
vous a fait endurer
dans ce soi-disant parrainage,
- vous étes copains maintenant ?
- Oui.
Parce que je trouve
l'alternative répugnante.
C'est-à-dire ?
Une ombre largement méconnue
mais écœurante plane sur notre foi.
C'est un problème que j'ai ignoré dans
l'enseignement que je vous ai prodigué.
Malgré l'interdit sur l'esclavage
dans le Coran,
il y a une tradition maléfique
qui existe encore
de nos jours.
Nos frères musulmans du nord
capturent nos frères africains du sud
au nom d'Allah,
pour islamiser
ceux qui ressemblent à vous et moi.
Nous, les musulmans d'Amérique,
nous refusons de voir,
car cela ne colle pas
avec la belle petite image
des chrétiens blancs
asservissant les noirs.
J'ai enfin compris
que dans un sens, j'asservissais
les gens à notre foi
pour satisfaire mes propres besoins.
Vous considérez
vos efforts de conversion
- comme une forme d'esclavage ?
- Oui.
Dans le sens où cela m'a permis
de maintenir une belle image de moi.
Cela a parfois pris
des proportions significatives.
Et puis il y a Adebisi.
C'était un Africain noir
qui défiait et se moquait de tout
ce que je voulais pour l'homme noir.
L'esprit d'Adebisi
ne m'a pas influencé.
Ce serait du vaudou.
Il n'a pas fait de moi
un homme violent.
Je suis un homme violent,
comme tous les hommes.
Voyant que j'échouais à le convaincre,
je m'en suis débarrassé.
Si nous, en tant que noirs
et musulmans,
voulons sincèrement
nous battre pour la liberté,
alors Omar White devrait avoir
le droit d'étre qui il est,
et moi le droit d'étre
qui je suis.
Alors je remercie Allah
pour ce soi-disant parrainage
qu'il m'a fait endurer.
Détenu 97R492 :
James Robson.
Condamné le 7 novembre 1997
pour homicide volontaire
et agression.
Verdict : perpétuité,
dont 25 ans fermes.
- Tu appelles ça un repas ?
- Rien de froid ni de croustillant.
Tu fais un régime ?
Non, ça me fait mal, connard.
Est-ce que j'ai l'air gros ?
Merde.
Tout à coup,
la glace, les croûtons,
j'ai l'impression
que ça me ratisse les gencives.
T'y comprends quelque chose ?
C'est certainement
un recul des gencives.
Mon vieux avait
des problèmes aux gencives.
Il remonte à quand
ton dernier détartrage ?
J'en sais rien,
cinq ou six ans.
Je déteste aller chez le dentiste.
Fais pas le con avec ta bouche.
Mon vieux s'en est pas occupé,
sa bouche a fini
par partir en vrille.
Si j'étais toi, j'irais
voir le Dr Faraj.
A moins que tu veuilles manger
des petits pots à 40 ans.
Faraj ?
Je laisserai pas ses pattes de bougnoule
s'approcher de ma bouche.
Ils portent des gants
maintenant, tu sais.
Depuis le SIDA.
Sérieusement, depuis combien
de temps tu n'y es pas allé ?
En plus des caries,
les dents 10 et 11 présentent
un sérieux recul des gencives.
- C'est-à-dire ?
- Je vous conseille la chirurgie.
Et je dirais
que le plus vite sera le mieux.
- Quel genre de chirurgie ?
- Vous avez deux possibilités.
La méthode conventionnelle est de
prélever du tissu dans votre bouche
- pour le greffer sur vos gencives.
- Merde.
- Putain, ça doit faire mal.
- En effet.
L'alternative,
c'est la greffe dermale acellulaire,
qui consiste à prélever du tissu
dans la gencive d'un cadavre.
C'est une blague. Les gencives d'un
putain de cadavre dans ma bouche ?
Considérez cela
comme un don d'organe.
Putain, ça me paraît malsain.
Certes, mais si on utilise
votre putain de tissu,
votre putain de rétablissement
sera plus long et douloureux.
Au final, vos putain de gencives seront
plus saines dans les deux cas.
Vous m'imitez, Faraj ?
Mais non, putain.
Votre attitude tiers-mondiste de merde
ne me plaît pas du tout.
Et quoi que je décide, Banania,
j'aime pas les aiguilles.
Alors pour l'anesthésie,
il me faut du gaz d'abord.
Tout le plaisir est pour moi, Sahib.
Ah oui, j'oubliais.
Vu que je suis Aryen
et que t'es croisé avec un chameau,
je te serais reconnaissant de porter
deux paires de gants en plastique.
Moins on aura de contacts,
mieux ce sera.
Alors, t'en penses quoi ?
Que tu choisisses l'un ou l'autre,
ce n'est pas très réjouissant.
Sans déconner. Tu comprends
pourquoi je déteste les dentistes ?
Ce n'est pas leur faute, Robson.
Tu ne fais pas de détartrage,
tu n'utilises pas de fil à dent.
Tu te brosses les dents
comme tu te grattes les couilles.
Je pensais choisir le truc acellulaire.
C'est lequel celui-là ?
C'est comme une donation d'organe.
Si j'avais besoin d'un foie,
le donneur serait mort, non ?
Certes, mais t'as pas
besoin d'un foie.
Le foie, ça ne se voit pas.
Il a dit que c'était un petit
morceau de tissu.
- On pourrait parler d'autre chose ?
- Et merde.
Je choisis les gencives
du cimetière.
Bordel.
Salut, quoi de neuf docteur ?
C'est légal ce truc ?
Tu imagines ce que ça donnerait
si tu vendais ça
à tous les camés d'Oz ?
Ils ont la came,
mais toi t'as de la bombe.
Vous avez vraiment un faible
pour le gaz, vous les Nazis.
Va chier.
Je croyais t'avoir dit
de mettre deux paires de gants.
- Ouvrez bien.
- Non, je veux encore du gaz.
- Je sens que l'effet se dissipe.
- Vous n'en avez pas besoin. Ouvrez.
Vous savez,
malgré votre idéologie perverse,
je parie que vous
n'avez jamais réfléchi
à la raison pour laquelle Adolf
en voulait tellement aux juifs.
Une des théories est qu'il avait été
traumatisé par la mort de sa mère.
Elle est morte d'un cancer du sein
et son médecin était juif.
Cette haine refoulée a bien sûr
refait surface et a entraîné l'Holocauste.
Une autre théorie
est que le père d'Hitler
était le fils illégitime
d'une femme allemande
et d'un homme juif méconnu,
ce qui veut dire qu'Hitler lui-méme
avait du sang impur.
Attention,
ne me faites pas déraper,
nous aurions tous deux des problèmes.
Vous savez, c'est incroyable.
On ne sait méme pas
d'où viennent ces gencives.
Je veux dire
qu'elles pourraient étre
les gencives d'un youpin,
d'un métèque,
ou méme d'un pédé.
Vous pourriez vous retrouver
avec les magnifiques gencives
d'un beau grand négro.
Bonjour, messieurs.
Regardez ça.
Va chercher.
Viens ici, Chester. Viens.
- Il va chercher.
- Il devra oublier.
Je vous ai dit
de ne pas lui apprendre à s'amuser.
- C'est pour se brosser les dents ?
- Aujourd'hui on va étudier la maîtrise.
Commencez à marcher par ici.
- C'est quoi ces conneries ?
- Vous m'avez foutu les jetons.
Je suis désolée
mais on se moque de votre réaction.
C'est celle des chiens qui nous
intéresse. Ils doivent rester concentrés
méme quand ils entendent
des bruits forts et effrayants.
Et alors, vous allez
les rendre sourds ?
Quelle bonne idée,
un chien sourd pour des aveugles.
- T'es un génie.
- On dresse le chien
en mettant le pied sur la laisse
et en disant : "doucement".
- Doucement ?
- Doucement.
Vous vous souvenez
quand j'ai commencé,
je vous ai parlé de l'agent Rivera ?
Je l'ai rendu aveugle,
et je voulais réparer ça...
- C'est ce que vous faites.
- Ouais,
mais je voudrais faire quelque chose
pour lui directement.
Je voudrais donner Julie à Rivera.
Quel est son statut ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je n'ai pas de nouvelles d'Eugene
depuis longtemps.
Appelez-le, demandez-lui de venir.
On verra s'il veut un chien-guide
et s'il en a besoin.
J'essaierai, mais vue l'opinion
qu'il a de cet endroit, je promets rien.
Eugene, Tina,
je suis ravi de vous voir.
Vous avez tous deux
l'air en pleine forme.
C'est vous qui voyez.
Je m'appelle Alicia Hinden.
Je vous remercie d'étre venus.
Bonjour.
Avez-vous lu la brochure
sur notre programme ?
Oui.
Ça a l'air intéressant.
Pour ceux qui n'ont personne.
Ces chiens sont faits
pour les gens seuls.
Eugene m'a à ses côtés.
En réalité, le chien n'aide pas
seulement la personne qu'il guide.
Il aide toute la famille
en vous donnant du temps libre.
J'aime aider mon mari.
Tina, c'est une façon de l'aider.
Comme Alvarez l'a aidé ?
Moi aussi, je suis sceptique.
J'ai travaillé ici,
vous vous souvenez ?
Je ne crois pas ces connards capables
de faire quelque chose de bien.
Qui dresse ces chiens ?
Hé bien, celui que...
nous avons pour vous
a en fait été dressé
par Miguel Alvarez.
- Vous vous foutez de moi ?
- Je savais qu'il était derrière ça.
- Il a fait un travail magnifique.
- Eugene, mon chéri, partons.
Il a tenu à ce que
nous vous donnions Julie.
Donc si vous le souhaitez, Eugene,
Julie est à vous.
- J'en sais rien.
- Non !
Pas question. Merde, Eugene,
tu envisages de dire oui ?
Il a probablement dressé ce bâtard
pour t'attaquer.
Je vous assure que non.
Viens, on s'en va.
On a besoin de tout sauf
que cet enfoiré nous rende service.
Réfléchissez, M. Rivera,
s'il vous plaît.
Bon Dieu.
T'es un bon chien, Julie.
Détenu 02M535 :
Père Daniel Meehan.
Condamné le 9 février 2002
pour destruction de propriété privée,
et agression d'un agent
des forces de l'ordre.
Verdict : 15 ans,
dont cinq fermes.
T'es ici pour quoi, Papy ?
C'est le Père Noël.
- Il ne passera pas l'année.
- Te casse pas les reins.
- Je suis en bas ?
- T'as tout pigé.
Il y avait une famille O'Reily
dans ma dernière paroisse, St. Patrick.
C'était pas la mienne.
Ma famille ne va à l'église
que pour les enterrements.
Je vois.
Non.
Tu vois rien, trouduc.
C'est pas parce que j'ai été baptisé
que j'ai besoin d'un connard de curé.
Je le note.
J'ai remanié mon emploi du temps
pour pouvoir aller au procès de Cyril
tous les jours.
Je serai assise juste derrière lui
au tribunal.
Il ne sera pas condamné, Ryan.
Il ne sera pas condamné à mort.
Comment tu te sens, mon petit ?
- J'ai peur.
- Il ne faut pas avoir peur.
Maman sera avec toi tout le temps.
D'accord ?
Regarde, je t'ai amené
un nouveau costume.
J'espère qu'il t'ira,
je n'étais pas sûr de la taille.
On n'a pas le droit de venir avec toi
dans le bus, d'accord ?
Alors j'emmène Suzanne
dans ma voiture.
- On se retrouve juste avant le procès.
- D'accord.
Tout va bien se passer.
- J'aimerais que tu viennes.
- Tu n'as pas besoin de moi.
Tu te débrouilleras très bien.
Écoute, au cas
où tu te mettes à paniquer,
je veux que tu penses à moi, d'accord ?
Pense à moi en train de faire ça.
Allons-y.
Lance la balle.
Lance cette putain de balle.
Elle est à peu près de la taille
de ta tronche, Morales.
Faut reconnaître
que t'as du style, Jia.
Tu m'as eu, je pensais que
Li Chen ferait du mal à ma mère.
C'est toi qui nous as piégés,
Cyril et moi.
Tu pensais que ton gars
allait nous éclater,
t'avais pas prévu l'inverse.
Zou Kai.
Moi aussi j'ai du style,
mon frère.
Hé Shupe, je vois que t'es plus
en détention provisoire.
- Me cherche pas, O'Reily.
- Je cherche personne.
Je me demandais juste
combien tu as été payé
par Jia Kenmin pour raconter des
mensonges au garde sur Cyril.
Regarde-moi.
Je vais te donner une chance
de rétablir la vérité.
- J'ai dit la vérité.
- D'accord.
Je t'ai amené un truc
spécialement pour toi.
Bouffe.
J'ai pas faim.
C'est ce que je pensais.
- Glen Shupe.
- Qu'est-ce que tu lui veux ?
Je veux que ce fils de pute
ait un accident.
- Grave ?
- Pas mort, juste pour l'affaiblir.
Et que je ne sois pas impliqué
dans l'affaire.
Qu'est-ce que tu me donnes
en échange ?
La mort de Jia Kenmin,
sans que tu sois impliqué.
Affaire conclue.
- Sean, j'ai besoin de...
- Poussez-vous !
Docteur, j'ai récupéré le bras.
J'ai récupéré le bras.
Le premier jour de procès
ne s'est pas bien passé.
Le juge Moore était d'humeur
exécrable, et le procureur
est intelligent et pas facile.
Vous voulez dire qu'on va perdre ?
Je ne veux pas vous donner
de faux espoirs.
Pendant le recrutement des jurés,
Cyril était très agité.
Il n'arrétait pas de parler tout haut,
et le juge n'arrétait pas
de lui dire de se taire.
Moore pourrait le renvoyer du tribunal.
- Le juge connaît son état mental ?
- Oui, il est au courant.
- Il s'en moque.
- Je vais parler à Cyril.
Bonjour, Cyril.
Salut.
Je peux entrer ?
Bien sûr.
Comment ça s'est
passé aujourd'hui ?
Beaucoup de charabia.
"Objection",
"Motion de bla bla bla".
Tous ces mots sont confus
pour toi, hein ?
Tout le monde avait l'air méchant.
Je posais des questions,
mais le type assis au bureau
tapait avec son truc
et me disputait.
Maman était derrière moi,
mais trop loin
pour que je puisse lui parler.
Je t'ai amené quelque chose.
Une marionnette !
Je veux que tu l'emmènes avec toi
au tribunal tous les jours.
Et quand tu auras envie
de parler à quelqu'un,
je veux que tu lui parles
à voix basse, d'accord ?
Mais tu devras murmurer,
sans faire de bruit,
pour que personne ne t'entende.
Montre-moi.
- Sœur Pete veut qu'on...
- Plus doucement.
Excellent.
A la fin de chaque journée,
vous me raconterez
ce que vous vous étes dit,
et je t'expliquerai tout, d'accord ?
Il faut lui donner un nom.
Bien, comment veux-tu l'appeler ?
- Jericho.
- Pourquoi Jericho ?
Parce que les murs
se sont écroulés.
Éteignez les lumières.
Bon Dieu, tu pries beaucoup.
J'attends beaucoup de Dieu :
la force, les conseils, le pardon.
Pendant que tu y es, demande-lui
de rétablir les visites conjugales.
- Tu ne pries donc jamais ?
- Pas depuis l'école primaire.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Pourquoi as-tu arrété ?
Un curé a essayé de me peloter
dans le confessionnal.
J'en suis désolé.
Certains prétres s'égarent
spirituellement...
Te bile pas, mon Père.
Je disais ça pour rire.
Écoute, j'ai rendez-vous demain
avec le Père Mukada,
et je me disais...
Lumières éteintes veut dire :
"ferme ta gueule".
Des nouvelles de l'état d'Augustus ?
J'ai laissé un message au Dr Panitz
à l'Hôpital Benchley.
Quand il me rappellera,
je te tiendrai au courant.
- Et toi, tu as des nouvelles pour moi ?
- Pas encore.
- Tu as trouvé qui a drogué Hill ?
- Pas encore.
Trouve qui c'est,
je m'occupe du reste.
Bien sûr, McManus.
Bien sûr.
Tu m'as donné ta parole.
C'est ce qui nous lie,
c'est ça ?
Allez, bougez-vous !
Hé, Burr, je te dis
que ça doit étre les Siciliens
qui ont camé Augustus.
Ils ont les boules
parce que Morales et toi
vous leur piquez
leur trafic de came.
- File-moi des preuves.
- Des preuves ?
Les preuves ça tombe pas
du ciel, mon pote.
J'ai besoin de preuves.
Merde.
- Chico, mon frère !
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
On a un blème, frangin.
Burr croit que c'est ta came qui a
envoyé Hill dans l'espace intersidéral.
La revanche le démange.
- Moi ?
- Ouais.
Non, mon pote,
ça doit étre les Siciliens.
C'est ce que je lui ai dit, mais
tu connais Burr, il veut étre sûr.
J'ai pensé à un truc.
Il faut que tu trouves quelqu'un
qui dise avoir vu les ritals
donner la came à Hill.
- Qui ?
- J'en sais rien, mon pote.
Quelqu'un de...
comment t'appelles ça ?
Quelqu'un de désintéressé.
Excusez-moi.
Quoi ?
Quoi ?
Salvatore Desanto.
C'est lui qui a camé Augustus.
Ouais.
J'ai tout vu.
- D'accord.
- Bien.
Tu vois, je te l'avais dit.
Ce soir au dîner, je veux que
tu me rendes un petit service.
Mets ça dans le repas
de Desanto pour moi.
- C'est quoi ?
- Un truc qui te nique la téte.
Moi je dis qu'il faut
buter Redding.
On a déjà essayé.
Y veut pas crever.
C'est des conneries, Sal.
Tout le monde finit par crever.
Putain.
Putain, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Bon sang, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Ma téte.
- Merde.
- C'est quoi ce bordel ?
Salvatore Desanto est en état
de mort cérébrale. Overdose de LSD.
Merde, ça craint.
J'ai vu passer beaucoup
d'acide, au Vietnam.
Ce truc, c'est plus mortel
que les Vietcongs.
C'est un truc
qui t'explose le cerveau.
Ouais.
Je devrais faire tester
le repas de Desanto.
C'est une bonne idée, ça.
Le seul problème,
c'est qu'il ne reste rien.
Mes gars sont peut-étre
pas très doués pour la cuisine,
mais à la fin de la journée
ils la nettoient bien cette cafétéria,
c'est moi qui vous le dis.
- Je n'en doute pas.
- Impeccable.
La première fois
que je me suis fait violer par Adebisi,
j'ai pensé :
"Il ne peut rien m'arriver de pire".
Je me trompais.
Ils étaient combien ?
Trois.
Vous savez pourquoi ils l'ont fait ?
Qu'est-ce que ça peut faire ?
C'est important pour vous.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez
que je vous dise ?
Peter, je ne veux pas que vous disiez
quoi que ce soit,
je veux juste que vous compreniez
que méme si vous pensez
que vous l'avez provoqué,
vous ne méritiez pas d'étre violé.
Qui que ce soit, ces hommes
n'avaient aucun droit de vous violer.
D'accord.
Demain à la méme heure ?
Non.
Je ne crois pas
que tout ça m'aide beaucoup.
Peter.
Merci d'avoir essayé.
Je veux trouver les trois hommes
qui ont violé Schibetta.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi, Leo ?
Pourquoi ?
Écoutez, on fait tout ce qu'on peut
pour que le nombre de viols
signalés soit à la baisse.
Signalés ?
Vous vous entendez parler ?
Votre propre fille a été violée.
C'est différent ici,
on est à Oz.
- Un viol est un viol, Leo.
- Je ne suis pas d'accord.
Ici, le viol a un effet "nivelant".
Dès qu'il est arrivé, Peter Schibetta
a voulu étre un dur,
il a voulu faire comme son père,
commander,
faire du mal aux gens.
Adebisi l'a remis à sa place.
- On l'a de nouveau remis à sa place.
- Qu'est-ce que vous me dites ?
Avez-vous une dent
contre Schibetta ?
Non.
Il s'agit simplement
de la survie du plus fort.
C'est aussi naturel et simple
que la théorie de Darwin.
Nous avons eu de nombreux
désaccords au fil des ans, mais là...
Peter Marie...
"Un effet nivelant" ?
Vous voulez que le viol fasse
le travail à votre place ?
Vous voyez ce médaillon ?
C'est Saint Dismas.
C'est le patron des prisonniers.
Al Capone l'a donné à mon grand-père
dans les années 20.
- Al Capone était croyant ?
- Non.
Mais il tenait
à protéger ses arrières.
Dr Nathan,
je me sens de pire en pire.
Je sais.
La dernière fois que j'ai fait
une prière, j'avais neuf ans.
J'ai oublié comment prier.
Moi aussi.
- Hola vous-méme.
- Vous étes mal lunée aujourd'hui.
Je suis frustrée.
Je m'occupe de Peter Schibetta.
On avance déjà à tout petits pas,
et ce matin il me dit qu'il ne veut plus
venir aux séances.
Il devrait peut-étre rencontrer un autre
homme qui s'est fait violer.
J'y ai déjà pensé.
Dites-moi, étes-vous au courant
de tensions entre Leo et Peter ?
Non, pourquoi ?
Pour rien.
C'est un de ces jours
où tout est complètement confus.
Ma journée n'est pas terrible non plus.
Chucky Pancamo
a reçu un coup de couteau,
et la plaie a dégénéré
en infection.
Il faiblit très vite.
Et vous vous en voulez.
Sa plaie s'est infectée
sous ma surveillance.
La vie est assez dangereuse
comme ça à Oz.
Si en plus les détenus meurent
suite à des traitements médicaux
de mauvaise qualité...
Vous voyez,
nous avons complètement échoué
dans notre travail.
Alors qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire ?
Former un groupe de filles ?
- J'aimerais vous demander un service.
- Bien sûr.
J'aimerais que vous parliez
à Peter Schibetta.
D'accord.
Seulement si...
vous montrez à Chucky Pancamo
comment prier.
Peter.
Entrez.
Asseyez-vous.
Puis-je vous tenir la main ?
Vous étes bénie
entre toutes les femmes...
Vous étes bénie
entre toutes les femmes...
Et Jésus,
le fruit de vos entrailles...
Et Jésus, le fruit
de vos entrailles...
- est béni.
- est béni.
Sainte Marie, Mère de Dieu...
Sainte Marie, Mère de Dieu...
- Priez pour nous pauvres pécheurs...
- Priez pour nous pauvres pécheurs...
Maintenant et à l'heure de notre mort.
Maintenant et à l'heure de notre mort.
Amen.
Hoyt.
Je suis content de vous voir,
mon Père.
- Vraiment ?
- Les visites sont toujours agréables.
Cet endroit de merde
me file les jetons.
Jaz, vous avez confessé plusieurs
meurtres, dont celui de Jim Burns.
Mais vous n'avez pas agi seul.
On vous a aidé.
Je balance pas mes potes.
Pas tous,
mais Timmy Kirk...
- J'ai tué Timmy Kirk.
- Non.
Vous avez fait beaucoup d'efforts,
mais il a survécu.
- Il est de retour à Oz.
- Cet enfoiré !
Si vous dites la vérité sur Kirk
au gardien,
Kirk va emménager juste à côté.
Allez me chercher Glynn.
Je veux chanter.
C'est la version de Hoyt
contre la mienne.
Il a tué Burns et il a emmuré Cloutier
dans un mur de briques.
C'est une sorte de revanche
bizarre de sa part.
- Je suis innocent.
- Menteur !
Ray.
Tu brûleras en enfer, Kirk !
Ramenez Kirk à l'unité B.
C'est toi qui brûleras.
Hé, Clarence.
- Comment ça va ?
- Bien.
T'as fait de la muscu ?
- Ouais.
- Ça se voit.
T'es là pour incendie criminel ?
- Ouais.
- Ouais.
T'en connais d'autres,
des incendiaires ?
Je veux dire, hors d'ici.
Un ou deux.
Ça te dirait une petite pipe ?
L'église de Notre Dame de Fatima
et son presbytère
ont été détruits ce soir par
un incendie, tuant deux prétres.
Les deux prétres, le Père John Downing
et le Père Jack Hurlbert,
se sont retrouvés bloqués
à l'étage du presbytère.
Le Père Raymond Mukada
a également été blessé
- par l'inhalation de fumées toxiques.
- Merde !
Il se trouve à l'Hôpital Benchley,
dans un état critique.
On soupçonne que cet incendie
soit d'origine criminelle.
Puis-je prendre la parole,
monsieur ?
Bien sûr.
Des nouvelles d'Adam Guenzel ?
Votre plan, ça avance ?
Je pense
que d'ici la fin de la semaine,
il me sucera la bite.
Hier j'ai pris la déposition
de Jerry Heekin.
Qui est-ce ?
Il dit vous avoir vu vous débarrasser du
corps de Brice Tibbets dans le champ.
C'est un témoin très crédible.
- Tiens donc ?
- Vous disiez que dans son témoignage
il précisait qu'il était tard,
qu'il faisait sombre,
qu'il n'y avait pas de lumière.
Hé bien voyez-vous,
il avait une lampe électrique.
Il vous a vu.
- Clairement.
- C'était pas moi.
Écoutez-moi.
Il y a beaucoup de types
qui me ressemblent.
J'ai un visage très commun.
Vous savez,
je suis divorcée.
Ouais.
Mon mariage avec Eddie
a duré dix ans.
Un jour je lui demande où il était allé,
il me dit : "Chez Barney's".
Il l'a dit si vite,
de façon si convaincante,
que j'ai su immédiatement
qu'il mentait.
Vous me traitez de menteur ?
Tout citoyen de ce pays
a droit à un procès équitable
et un bon avocat.
Je ne peux pas étre
cet avocat pour vous.
J'appellerai la commission,
ils vous trouveront un autre avocat.
Attendez une minute, Catherine.
J'ai besoin de vous.
Keller, votre charme ne servira
à rien cette fois-ci.
Catherine !
Catherine !
Toby.
Je voulais que tu saches
que je ne m'occupe plus de Keller.
Pourquoi ?
Que s'est-il passé ?
Il est coupable.
Je me suis promise une chose
quand j'ai passé le barreau.
De ne jamais défendre
quelqu'un qui est coupable.
Je ne vais pas commencer aujourd'hui,
méme pas pour toi.
Je comprends.
Dis-moi.
Quand je t'ai demandé s'il t'avait parlé
des meurtres, tu as dit non.
Ouais.
J'ai menti.
Keller dit tellement de choses,
qui sait ce qui est vrai ?
Mais tu le crois
quand il te dit qu'il t'aime.
Oui.
Vous allez bien ensemble.
Catherine...
L'amour nous fait tous faire
des choses étranges.
Tu ne m'apprends rien.
Bon vent.
Tu connaissais la femme
que tu as violée ?
On sortait ensemble à une époque.
On s'est croisés par hasard
dans un bar,
on a pris de la kétamine,
on a commencé à s'embrasser.
Et puis ni une ni deux,
Franklin et moi on s'est retrouvés
sur elle dans le parc,
à lui coller la face dans l'herbe.
Je n'ai jamais violé une femme
que je connaissais.
- Adam ?
- Ouais ?
- On peut se parler ?
- Je suis occupé.
Deux secondes.
Les amoureux roucoulent.
Tu ne devrais pas traîner
avec ces types.
Ce serait mieux si je jouais au
Backgammon avec toi et Busmalis ?
Les motards sont dans le camp
de Schillinger.
Ils sont juste sympa avec toi
pour essayer de te piéger.
Schillinger veut t'avoir.
Et comme tu es sa pute,
tu es bien placé pour le savoir.
Hé Guenzel, tu nous fais
un téte à téte amoureux avec Beecher ?
Suce-moi pendant que t'y es,
sale pédé.
- Enfoiré.
- Chevauche-le, cow-boy.
But !
- C'est mon pote, ça !
- Ouais.
Schillinger.
Tu m'as fait une offre l'autre jour.
Tu m'aides à voir Keller
et je te donne Guenzel.
Ouais.
L'offre tient toujours ?
J'en sais rien.
Je laisse tomber Sœur Pete, et je viens
travailler avec toi au courrier.
J'annule les Siciliens.
S'il te plaît.
D'accord.
Je ne veux plus
que tu protèges Adam Guenzel.
Après avoir vu ce qu'il t'a fait,
je suis pas surpris.
C'est un petit con, ce gamin.
- Ma Sœur.
- Bonjour.
Je dois vous dire quelque chose.
J'ai décidé de ne plus
travailler pour vous.
- Quoi ?
- Vous savez,
je fais le méme travail
depuis cinq ans.
Je m'ennuie.
Écoutez,
je ne me doutais absolument pas
que vous étiez malheureux.
Je ne suis pas malheureux.
- Si je peux...
- Je ne suis pas malheureux.
Bon, d'accord.
Si vous étes décidé.
Je le suis.
D'accord.
Quand voulez-vous partir ?
Aujourd'hui.
Aujourd'hui ?
Vous voulez aller travailler
avec les aryens ?
Depuis qu'on se fréquente
Schillinger et moi,
on s'entend très bien.
Et puis travailler au courrier
vous permet de voir Keller.
Je ne vous blâme pas.
Je suis d'accord avec Sœur Pete.
Vous devriez avoir droit aux visites.
Le seul problème,
c'est Adam Guenzel.
Je sais que vous ferez
ce que vous jugez bon,
mais Adam et moi
on ne s'entend pas du tout.
Je pense que vous aviez
peut-étre raison
quand vous vouliez le transférer
hors de Em City.
Oui, il est turbulent. Je pensais
que votre amitié le calmerait.
Moi aussi,
ça n'a pas marché.
D'accord,
je vais l'envoyer à l'unité B.
- Schillinger.
- Ouais ?
Le gamin est à toi.
C'est l'heure
de distribuer le courrier.
Hé toi, gros dur.
Toc toc.
Keller.
Fous le camp,
j'ai pas envie de jouer.
J'ai pas envie de baiser.
Tu oublies qui commande ici.
C'est toi, ma salope,
pas le contraire.
Je t'ai fait quelques faveurs,
et en échange,
tu me fais quelques
faveurs aussi.
Me touche pas.
Je veux pas la voir ta sale face,
grosse pute.
Bordel !
Bureau central, nous avons
un blessé à la section 32.
- La déchéance des grands.
- Va chier, sale pédé.
- Guenzel.
- Hé, Vern.
- Les gars d'Em City te saluent.
- Ta gueule.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
- Tu parles quand on te le demande.
- Lâchez-moi, bordel.
- Lâchez-moi !
- Monsieur, je peux regarder ?
Comment apprendrais-tu
si tu ne regardais pas ?
A l'aide !
Lâchez-moi, bordel !
Foutez-moi la paix !
- J'ai du courrier pour Keller.
- Il n'est pas là.
- Où est-il ?
- A l'Hôpital Benchley.
A l'hôpital ?
Que s'est-il passé ?
Il est devenu violent.
Je l'ai calmé.
Passe ton chemin, Beecher.
"La route qui mène en enfer est faite
de bonnes intentions".
Voilà un truc
qui t'embrouille le cerveau.
Le bon côté de ma volonté
est la route vers la damnation.
Merde ! Pourquoi essayer
d'être un mec bien, alors ?
Et si les bonnes intentions
mènent aux feux éternels,
où mènent
les mauvaises intentions ?
A Oz.
Nino, comprends-moi s'il te plaît.
Je ne l'ai pas fait exprès.
- J'ai fait tout ce que j'ai pu.
- Hé, Dr Nathan.
Pourriez le faire taire ? Il a papoté toute la
nuit, impossible de dormir.
Vous êtes assez remis pour sortir.
Ramenez Shupe à Em City.
Donnez cinq milligrammes de Haldol
à Pancamo deux fois par jour.
- Gloria.
- Salut.
- Chucky Pancamo est en plein délire.
- Comme d'habitude.
- Ce n'est pas drôle, Tim.
- D'après le formulaire, Augustus Hill
devait être transféré ici aujourd'hui.
Je ne le vois pas.
Son état est encore critique,
je l'ai mis en chambre privée.
D'accord, merci.
- Tu te sens comment ?
- Mal.
Tu as failli te suicider.
Tu veux me dire pourquoi ?
J'ai pas voulu me suicider.
Tu avais une quantité massive
d'héroïne dans le corps,
qui t'a fait déraper
avec ton cathéter,
ce qui a entraîné
une défaillance rénale.
Tu n'as peut-être pas consciemment
essayé de te suicider,
- mais le résultat est proche.
- Ma mère est morte,
ma femme m'a lâché.
Tout à coup les murs de Oz sont
devenus trop hauts et trop épais.
Augustus, qui t'a donné
la drogue ?
- Pas d'importance.
- Pour moi si.
Écoutez, j'ai fait ce que j'ai fait,
je suis le seul à souffrir.
Salvatore Desantos est dans un état de
mort cérébrale à cause d'une overdose.
Je soupçonne Burr Redding
d'être le responsable.
Je le soupçonne de croire
que Desanto t'a vendu la drogue.
- C'est pas lui.
- Raison de plus pour me dire qui c'est.
- Je veux parler à Burr.
- Non.
- S'il vous plaît, McManus.
- Non.
Si tu as un message pour Burr Redding,
les télécoms c'est moi.
Salvatore Desanto n'a pas vendu
la drogue à Augustus.
Quoi ? Qui alors ?
- Il n'a pas voulu me dire.
- Il me le dira, à moi.
Pourquoi, pour que tu puisses
donner du LSD à ce type ?
Je n'ai pas de preuves
mais j'ai l'impression
que c'est toi qui as
explosé Desanto.
Je te donnerai pas une chance
d'exploser quelqu'un d'autre.
Agent, escortez ce monsieur.
- Où est Busmalis ?
- Pourquoi ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Tu m'as dit que c'était Desanto !
- Oui.
- Tu as menti.
- Non.
Pourquoi tu as menti,
Busmalis ?
- Tu protèges qui ? Guerra ?
- Guerra.
- C'est Guerra qui m'a fait mentir.
- Pourquoi ?
J'en sais rien, c'est peut-être lui
qui a vendu la drogue à Augustus.
Allez, barre-toi.
Je vais avoir une petite
discussion avec Morales.
Morales,
est-ce que Guerra a donné
la came à Augustus ?
Non.
- Tu mens.
- Tu sais quoi, Redding ?
Depuis qu'on a fait
la paix, toi et moi,
ça se passe plutôt bien.
Ne gâche pas tout
en faisant l'enfoiré.
Connard.
C'est moi
que tu traites d'enfoiré ?
Putain mais tu te crois où ?
M. et Mme Machin
ont décidé de faire un régime.
Manger mieux, être en bonne santé,
vivre plus longtemps. Rien à redire.
Or les analyses montrent
que le stress vécu par Monsieur en
essayant de réduire son cholestérol
peut faire autant de mal
que le cholestérol lui-même.
Le stress peut en fait faire augmenter
son niveau de cholestérol.
Prenez ces produits faibles en matières
grasses ou sans graisses.
C'est bourré de sucre,
pour que le goût soit meilleur.
Alors pendant que Madame maigrit,
son taux de sucre s'envole
et elle risque le diabète.
L'eau en bouteille. Qu'est-ce qu'il
peut y avoir de mauvais là-dedans ?
Les bouteilles, mon pote.
1, 5 tonne de plastique est utilisée
pour cela chaque année,
ce qui veut dire plus de gaz toxiques
dans l'air qu'on respire.
Alors en voulant
se mettre au naturel,
en fait on se suicide tout en tuant
la planète toute entière.
Regarde O'Reily.
Il n'a pas bougé de la journée.
Il attend le verdict du procès
pour meurtre de Cyril.
Les jurés sont encore
en train de délibérer.
- Tu crois qu'ils vont le condamner ?
- J'espère pas.
J'aime bien Cyril, ça me ferait mal
de le voir condamné à mort.
Ryan, des nouvelles ?
Rien.
L'avocate a dit qu'il faudrait peut-être
attendre quelques jours
avant que les jurés
rendent leur verdict.
J'aimerais tellement être avec Cyril
en isolement, je sais qu'il a peur.
Tout ça le dépasse complètement.
- Bien.
- Comment ça, bien ?
Moins il comprend,
meilleures sont nos chances
de renverser un verdict de culpabilité.
J'ai du mal à suivre, là.
Je ne vais pas laisser
Cyril mourir
sans me battre jusqu'au bout.
Pourquoi vous vous préoccupez
de mon frangin ?
C'est pas vos putains d'oignons.
Je suis peut-être détenu,
mais je suis toujours prêtre.
- Cyril est un enfant de Dieu.
- Hé, Meehan.
Tu sais quoi ?
Va voir ailleurs, d'accord ?
L'espoir c'est la dernière chose
dont j'ai besoin.
Va te faire foutre.
T'es sourd ?
O'Reily, viens avec moi.
- Où ?
- Les jurés sont de retour.
Prends ça.
Ryan.
- Bon Dieu.
- Je suis désolée.
- Nous allons faire appel.
- A quoi ça servira ?
Hé, ça va ?
Ouais.
- Fais une bise à Jericho.
- Cyril...
Fais-lui une bise !
Tu lui manques.
- La sentence, c'est quand ?
- Jeudi.
Je vais plaider la clémence
en raison de son état mental.
- Ne faites pas ça.
- Pourquoi pas ? Le juge...
C'est moi qui décide
pour lui, non ?
Je vous dis pas d'appel,
pas de clémence.
Maintenant laissez-nous
tranquilles.
Il y a un problème, Ryan ?
Non, au contraire.
Tu vas sortir, gamin.
Tu vas être libre.
Pourquoi veux-tu
que ton frère meure ?
Regarde comment on vit.
Quand on était gamins,
on nous battait, on nous ignorait,
on était tout le temps
au centre de détention juvénile.
Et puis Cyril se fait mettre
le cerveau en bouillie
et nous voilà coincés
dans ce trou à rats pour 90 ans.
Le néant c'est mieux
qu'une vie à Oz.
Une fois qu'il sera parti,
il sera parti pour toujours.
Tu devras vivre tous les jours avec le rôle
que tu auras eu dans cette affaire.
Crois-moi, je reconnais ce que j'ai fait pour
foutre la vie de Cyril en l'air.
- J'ai les épaules assez larges.
- Non.
- Tu n'en seras pas capable.
- Et pourquoi donc ?
- Je te connais, Ryan.
- Quoi ?
Tu crois me connaître ?
Tout ça parce qu'on s'assoit
et qu'on bavarde ?
C'est ça ?
Je vais te dire un truc, maman.
Même si tu avais été à la maison
pendant toute ma vie,
tu me connaîtrais
toujours pas.
- Ryan.
- Laissez-moi sortir !
Ryan ?
Le seul moyen de gagner en appel
est d'en appeler à l'opinion publique.
En 1989, la cour suprême a déclaré
qu'exécuter les malades mentaux
n'était pas une violation
du Huitième Amendement
parce qu'il n'y a pas de consensus
national contre ce type de punition.
Il nous faut donc
démontrer au tribunal
qu'il y a consensus,
que même les Américains
qui croient à la peine de mort
trouvent ce type d'exécution
cruel et inhabituel.
Il faut éveiller l'intérêt des médias.
Ma Soeur, pouvez-vous faire
un communiqué de presse
sur le fait qu'il est
impossible de déterminer
I'étendue de la culpabilité
de Cyril ?
Il savait qu'il faisait
quelque chose de mal,
mais il n'a pas conscience
de la gravité.
Un communiqué n'est pas suffisant,
il faudrait une conférence de presse.
Il doit être clair que je n'ai jamais pu
discuter de l'affaire avec Cyril,
qu'il n'a pas participé activement
à sa propre défense.
Père Meehan, vous pensez vraiment
qu'on peut y arriver ?
La loi est comme
notre Dieu tout puissant,
elle est parfois mystérieuse.
Nous devons continuer à la diriger
vers une issue plus charitable.
Matez un peu ça, les gars,
Shupe est de retour.
Applaudissez-le bien fort.
Tu te la joues
Chris Rock, O'Reily ?
- Que veux-tu, j'ai du talent.
- En parlant de talent,
on avait conclu une affaire. On amoche
Shupe, et toi tu crèves Jia Kenmin.
J'ai jamais dit
que je le ferais moi-même.
Je vais trouver quelqu'un que
les matons pourront pas accuser.
- Qui ?
- Les matons eux-mêmes.
J'ai entendu dire
que justice avait été faite.
Ton frangin va crever
pour avoir buté Li Chen.
Mon seul regret est que tu n'aies pas
été là le jour où j'ai témoigné.
Li Chen était un homme bien, il n'aurait
pas fait de mal à une mouche.
J'ai même essuyé
une putain de larme.
C'était magistral.
Hé, canard laqué...
Lâche-le.
Lâche-le tout de suite.
Enfoiré.
Fils de pute !
Ce n'est rien de grave.
- Comment vous sentez-vous ?
- J'ai mal partout.
- Comment va Jia ?
- Je n'ai pas pu le voir.
Les matons l'ont tout de suite
envoyé en isolement.
C'est mal vu de frapper
les gardes-chiourmes.
Vue sa précédente commotion
cérébrale, je m'inquiète.
Faut pas. C'est mieux pour tout le
monde si Jia retombe dans le coma.
Je vais demander
à quelqu'un de vous ramener.
J'y vais.
J'apprécie ce que tu as fait aujourd'hui,
O'Reily.
Si vous n'étiez pas arrivé,
ce chinetoque m'aurait brisé le cou,
c'était un renvoi d'ascenseur.
Quel teigneux, ce Jia.
Il n'arrête pas de dire
que vous êtes tous des tapettes.
Ah oui ?
On va lui donner une leçon.
Il va comprendre.
Salut, Jia.
Comment va la tête ?
Allez vous faire foutre.
Tu vois, moi je considère ça
comme un acte d'agression.
Bon Dieu !
Tu es content
de ce que tu as fait ?
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Tu as eu ta revanche
sur Jia Kenmin.
- Ce connard m'a attaqué.
- Il m'a semblé voir autrement.
Ferme ta grande gueule.
Pourquoi portes-tu
cette croix en or ?
Tu crois au Christ ressuscité
ou c'est juste une babiole ?
Que s'est-il passé
dans ton enfance ?
- Pourquoi t'es-tu détourné de l'Eglise ?
- Je ne me suis pas détourné.
- Je me suis enfui.
- Pourquoi ?
Quand j'étais gamin,
c'était le bordel chez nous,
mon père nous tapait
dessus sans arrêt
alors je suis allé voir le prêtre.
J'avais une marque dans le dos
de la taille de mon poing.
Alors j'ai demandé
au bon monseigneur
s'il voulait bien parler à mon père pour
lui dire d'arrêter de nous battre.
Il a dit que si mon père nous battait,
c'était parce qu'on était mauvais
et qu'on méritait d'être punis.
Et puis il m'a dit de rentrer chez moi
et "d'honorer mon père".
Il y a de mauvais prêtres,
mais il y a aussi
beaucoup de bons prêtres.
Ton prêtre ne t'a pas aidé,
mais moi je suis là.
Je suis là pour toi
et pour ton frère.
C'est trop tard, mon Père.
C'est trop tard, bordel.
M. et Mme Machin,
tous deux minces et sexy,
se rencontrent, tombent amoureux
et décident de se marier.
John achète un beau gros diamant
pour le doigt de Madame.
Sympa, sauf que
des gens en Afrique
ont une vie de merde à cause
de ces pierres précieuses.
Des hommes meurent tous les jours
dans des mines dangereuses.
Des hommes meurent tous les jours
dans des guerres civiles
qui ont pour objet le contrôle
du commerce de diamant.
Enfin bref,
M. et Mme se marient
et commencent à faire des mômes.
Merde, après tout, Dieu lui-même a dit
à Adam et Eve de se multiplier.
Seulement on s'est multipliés
au point de devenir parasites,
six milliards et des poussières.
Je me sens moins à l'étroit
dans ma cellule tout à coup.
Je ne sais pas comment
je vais me séparer de Julie.
J'avais un gamin.
Il est mort.
Ça a failli m'achever.
Je suis pas tombé
amoureux depuis.
Jusqu'à maintenant.
Tu sais, ce maton
que tu as rendu aveugle ?
- Eugene Rivera ?
- Ouais, il est pour lui ce chien ?
Non, et tant mieux.
Il dit qu'il ne veut rien avoir à faire
avec tout ce qui a
à voir avec moi.
T'as déjà vu ces petites bêtes
se battre en compétition ?
J'ai vu des coqs.
- Mais pas de chiens.
- Putain, c'est brutal.
Trois rounds d'enfer absolu.
Ces chiens se mettent en pièces.
- Arrête, putain !
- Désolé.
Penders, Alvarez,
qu'est-ce que c'est que ce truc ?
Aucune idée.
C'est de la merde de chien,
tête de noeud.
Comment vous savez
que c'est un chien qui a fait le coup ?
Qui d'autre chie par terre ?
Guerra.
Très drôle. Ramasse.
- Non.
- Non ?
- Non.
- Nettoie cette merde.
Pourquoi vous me lâchez
pas la grappe ?
Parce que j'en ai ras le bol de toi
et de ton putain de clebs.
Chester, au moins,
il a pas mauvaise haleine.
Chester, attaque !
- Vas-y, Chester.
- Putain !
C'est moche
ce que Penders a fait,
dresser Chester pour l'attaque.
Il a jeté une ombre
sur tout le programme.
Il l'aime vraiment, ce chien.
C'est les humains qu'il déteste.
Laisse-la te conduire
sur les escaliers.
- Quoi d'autre ?
- Fais-la asseoir.
Assise, Julie.
C'est bien, mon chien.
Et puis ?
Maintenant,
enlève ton bandeau.
- J'ai réussi l'examen ?
- Oui, mention très bien.
Tu as fait
du très bon travail.
Merci.
C'est elle qui a tout fait,
vous savez.
Et elle continuera,
grâce à toi.
Vous savez ce qui me plairait ?
J'aimerais savoir
qui va être son maître.
Hé bien, Miguel...
ton voeu va être exaucé.
Son maître devrait bientôt arriver.
- Qui est-ce ?
- McManus y travaille depuis ce matin.
Merde.
Je croyais
qu'il ne la voulait pas.
C'est Tina
qui ne la voulait pas.
Moi non plus, au début.
Écoutez...
J'adore ma femme
et tout ce qu'elle a fait pour moi,
mais elle mérite de vivre un peu.
Je sais que ce serait super
pour moi d'avoir ce chien,
et je pense
que petit à petit,
ce sera super pour elle aussi.
C'est bien.
Je vous présente Julie.
- Je l'ai dressée juste pour vous.
- C'est-à-dire ?
Quelle est la langue
que vous parlez à la maison ?
L'espagnol.
Faites comme si vous étiez
à la maison et appelez-la.
- Tu l'as dressée en espagnol ?
- Ouais.
Elle est complètement bilingue.
Dites-lui de s'asseoir.
Elle est à vous.
Allez, Eugene.
Allons-y.
Bravo, Tim, vous faites
d'une pierre deux coups.
Le programme de musique
et celui du "Meilleur Ami de l'Homme"
ont eu des résultats
positifs notables.
- Bravo !
- Merci.
Je voulais vous dire
à tous les deux
que j'apprécie votre soutien,
même s'il a été prudent
et peu sérieux.
Je me demandais où était passé
votre sens de la répartie.
Il faut que j'y aille,
je suis attendue à Lardner.
Leo, Timmy.
La glace a l'air d'avoir fondu
entre vous et la liaison
du gouverneur.
- Pardon ?
- Si je me laissais aller,
je dirais que vous avez
une liaison la liaison,
si ce n'est depuis hier soir
en tous cas depuis peu.
Oui, je dois y aller aussi.
D'accord, "Timmy".
51.
Ouais ! Nom de Dieu,
j'ai gagné !
Il était à moi, ce ticket gagnant !
- Je ne peux rien faire légalement ?
- Non.
Même si on pouvait le trouver,
c'est la parole de Dave Brass
contre la vôtre.
C'est un garde,
blessé pendant le service.
Vous, vous êtes un détenu qui est
connu pour parler avec Dieu.
Quel salaud !
Il devrait être arrêté
pour le meurtre de mon petit fils.
Alex ne peut vaincre sa leucémie
que par le don d'organe.
- Un don de moelle osseuse.
- Je sais.
Je croyais qu'avec ses origines,
les donneurs compatibles étaient rares.
En fait, le problème
c'est que personne ne cherche.
- Y'a bien quelqu'un quelque part.
- Ou ici.
Je parie que si on examine
les dossiers de chaque détenu à Oz,
y compris les anciens détenus,
on trouvera un donneur.
Pourquoi pas ?
- Pourquoi pas quoi ?
- Pourquoi pas examiner ces dossiers ?
Vous feriez ça pour moi ?
Pour vous, votre petit-fils,
pour Dave Brass,
pour avoir l'esprit en paix.
Martinez.
- Ils te renvoient en isolement ?
- Ouais.
Je pourrais peut-être t'aider.
Il suffit d'un mot ou deux
et tu te retrouves en unité B.
- Peut-être même Emerald City.
- Ouais ?
Pourquoi vous m'aideriez ?
T'as attaqué Dave Brass
sans raison apparente.
Mais moi, je crois
que t'avais une raison.
Et si tu me dis laquelle,
je pourrais peut-être t'aider.
J'ai rien à dire.
Tu as attaqué
un maton, Carlos.
Là où tu vas,
tu trouveras pas d'amis.
Si tu réfléchis pas un peu, tu vas avoir
beaucoup plus mal qu'en ce moment !
Martinez craque.
On est pas loin de le voir cracher tous
les noms de ceux qui sont impliqués.
Je parie qu'Enrique Morales
est en haut de la liste.
Tout cela n'aidera pas beaucoup
Rebadow, cela dit.
Même si on trouve Brass
et qu'on lui dit qui l'a entaillé,
il ne rendra pas
l'argent de la loterie.
Oui.
Oui, oui.
- J'ai trouvé.
- Trouvé quoi ?
Le salut.
Farai Gyrobile est
un Rastafarien de l'unité C.
Il se trouve qu'il a plus
en commun avec Bob Marley
que simplement le reggae.
Tous deux ont un père blanc.
Sa mère était-elle moitié antillaise
et moitié guatémaltèque ?
Oui, on dirait que c'est le donneur parfait
pour votre petit-fils.
Il ne reste plus qu'à le convaincre
de donner de la moelle osseuse.
Je peux lui parler seul ?
- De détenu à détenu ?
- Bien sûr.
Bonne chance.
Farai ?
Je m'appelle Bob Rebadow.
Celui qui s'est fait plumer de deux
millions de tous puissants dollars ?
Oui. Vois-tu...
J'avais besoin de cet argent
pour mon petit-fils.
- Il est atteint d'une leucémie.
- Dommage.
C'est pour cela
que j'ai besoin de ton aide.
Alex a des origines ethniques
très spécifiques,
- que tu partages.
- Comment tu connais mes origines ?
C'est McManus qui me l'a dit.
J'avais l'espoir que tu donnes
de la moelle osseuse à mon petit-fils.
McManus n'a pas le droit
de te divulguer ces conneries.
Tout le monde ici pense
que mon sang est noir à 100%.
Si je fais le don,
ils sauront la vérité.
Si tu le dis à qui que ce soit, t'iras rejoindre
ton petit-fils au paradis.
Attends.
Je suis désolé, Alex.
J'ai essayé.
Dieu m'a parlé hier soir.
Il m'a dit que l'élément manquant
dans le rétablissement d'Alex,
c'est la foi.
Pas l'argent ni la science.
Je veux trouver
un guérisseur,
quelqu'un qui ira
le voir à l'hôpital,
posera les mains sur lui
et fera disparaître cette leucémie.
- Je vois.
- Vous doutez.
Le peu que je sais des guérisseurs
me fait réfléchir.
Beaucoup de gens attendent
un miracle et se font avoir.
D'accord.
Il faut faire attention,
choisir attentivement.
Ça vaut ce que ça vaut,
mais le genre de personnes
auxquelles vous faites allusion
ne sont en général reconnues
par aucune église.
Soeur Peter, je n'ai pas dit
guérisseur religieux.
J'ai dit guérisseur par la foi.
La foi qui transcende toutes
les cultures, les systèmes.
Vous n'en avez pas marre
de l'esprit de clocher
des gens qui s'entourent seulement
des membres de leur club ?
Qui appartient à quoi,
qui a l'avantage avec Dieu ?
Sans vouloir vous froisser,
je ne veux appartenir à rien.
- Je veux juste croire.
- Et après ?
J'attends les instructions.
J'attends la parole.
Je suis la flèche
dans l'arc du Seigneur.
Combien de temps il lui reste ?
Quoi ?
Ton petit-fils, ils lui donnent
combien de temps à vivre ?
Qui es-tu ?
A. R Whitworth.
Combien de temps ?
Je n'en sais rien,
seul Dieu le sait.
Bonne réponse.
- Voilà qui est bien dit.
- De quoi parle-t-on ?
De la guérison par la foi, non ?
Comment tu es au courant ?
Tu me crois si je te dis
que la nuit dernière,
j'ai rêvé que
ton petit-fils guérissait ?
Peut-être.
Vas-y.
Bien.
Je suis né boiteux.
Une merde dans la colonne,
impossible à réparer.
Quand j'étais au lycée, j'ai découvert
que ma voisine guérissait par la foi,
elle était clairvoyante à 100%.
Pendant des années elle a refusé de
l'admettre, elle trouvait ça gênant.
Puis elle a guéri un ami
et la nouvelle s'est répandue.
Elle était juste à côté de moi
pendant tout ce temps.
Au début j'étais en colère,
pour te dire la vérité.
Mais elle est authentique.
Elle fait pas dans le show-biz.
Tu boites toujours un peu.
Récemment, ça a recommencé.
Mais c'est toujours
beaucoup mieux qu'avant.
Dieu détient peut-être la clé
de la santé de ton petit-fils,
La clé de sa guérison,
mais elle se trouve
à l'intérieur du petit.
Regina peut aller la chercher.
Hors de question !
- Sarah, écoute-moi.
- Je t'ai entendu.
Aucune femme bizarre
ne va faire de séance
de vaudou sur le lit d'Alex.
- Je ne le permettrai pas.
- Oublie tes préjugés pour un moment.
- Va la voir avec maman.
- Non.
Je ne vais pas agiter cette carotte
sous le nez d'un gamin de 10 ans
en phase terminale.
Il est trop fragile.
Imagine que ça ne marche pas.
On lui dit quoi, que Dieu ne l'aime pas
assez pour le guérir ?
Je ne veux pas
que le petit meure.
On attend et on prie
pour pouvoir faire
une greffe de moelle osseuse.
On attend et on prie.
On attend et on prie.
Si on faisait
quelque chose, bon sang ?
Doucement, Rebadow.
C'est une affaire de famille.
Je voudrais monter
au sommet d'une montagne
et insulter notre imbécile
étroitesse d'esprit moderne,
nos méthodes civilisées lamentables
pour survivre à la maladie.
Les hôpitaux sont censés être
le sommet du potentiel humain, non ?
C'est un ramassis de conneries !
- Tu as fini ?
- Non.
- Je trouverai quelqu'un d'autre.
- Qui ?
La raison pour laquelle tu n'as pas
appelé Alex, Sophie ou maman
c'est que tu savais
que tu devrais les convaincre.
Personne dans notre famille
ne va laisser
une étrangère entrer
dans la chambre d'Alex.
Tu ne peux pas faire ça.
Bien sûr que si.
Tu sais ce que je vois ?
Je vois un homme qui essaie
de se racheter aux yeux de sa famille,
en faisant un ultime effort
après des années d'absence.
Tu vois, moi aussi parfois
je peux être clairvoyante.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ouvrir cette porte
pour me la fermer au nez ?
Guéris...
Au nom de Dieu.
L'église de Notre Dame de Fatima
et son presbytère
ont été détruits par un incendie
ce soir, tuant deux prêtres.
Le Père Raymond Mukada
a aussi été blessé,
suite à l'inhalation
de fumées toxiques.
Il se trouve dans un état critique
à l'Hôpital Benchley.
Je ne veux plus rien entendre, Seroy.
Je t'envoie en isolement.
Attendez.
Si je vous donne des infos,
j'ai droit à un sursis ?
- Quel genre d'infos ?
- A propos du Père Mukada.
Si je vous disais
que l'incendie de l'église de Mukada
a été commandité
par un détenu d'Oz ?
- Qui ?
- Pas tant qu'on a pas conclu un deal.
Clarence Seroy est un gros sac
à merde plein de mensonges.
C'est ce que tu as dit
quand Jaz Hoyt t'a impliqué
dans le meurtre de Jim Burns.
- Je suis innocent.
- Non, t'es un petit con coupable
qui va prendre ses responsabilités
pour la merde qu'il a provoquée.
Vous ne pouvez pas
prouver sérieusement
que j'ai organisé l'incendie ou que je
sois impliqué dans le meurtre de Burns.
C'est leur parole contre la mienne.
Tu crois connaître le système ?
J'ai quelques années
de plus que toi, Kirk.
Ray Mukada est un ami.
Il est allongé sur un lit d'hôpital
et ça, ça m'énerve...
Ça me fait royalement chier.
C'est ton témoignage
contre celui de Kirk.
Il dit qu'il n'a rien à voir
avec le meurtre de Burns.
- Il dit que tu mens.
- Pourquoi ? Je suis condamné à mort.
Ce dont on a besoin,
c'est d'un autre témoin.
Un de tes potes motards
va devoir se mouiller.
- Pour finir ici ?
- Pas nécessairement.
S'il n'a pas participé au crime,
je le laisse tranquille.
Tout ce que ton pote aura à dire,
c'est qu'il a entendu Kirk
te proposer le meurtre.
Marché conclu.
Timothy Kirk,
vous êtes accusé
du meurtre de James Burns.
- Quoi ?
- Mon ami Max
vient de confirmer
la version des faits de Jaz Hoyt.
Mettez Kirk en isolement
jusqu'au début du procès.
- Homicide volontaire, peine capitale.
- Non.
- Directeur, s'il vous plaît.
- "Celui qui vient avec sa vanité
- s'en ira dans l'obscurité".
- Je suis désolé.
"Son nom sera
couvert d'obscurité".
"Il ne verra plus jamais le soleil".
Et enfin, je suis
heureux d'annoncer
que Ray Mukada sortira
de l'Hôpital Benchley
demain après-midi.
Quand revient-il au travail ?
Les médecins ne sont pas sûrs,
nous espérons bientôt.
Bien, c'est tout.
Peter Marie...
Vous ne m'avez pas dit un mot
depuis notre petite conversation
sur Peter Schibetta.
"Petite conversation" ?
Vous savez, j'étais ravie quand vous
avez décidé de ne pas démissionner.
Mais depuis
vous êtes devenu intransigeant.
Keller ne peut pas voir Beecher...
Schibetta, Alvarez...
On dirait que quand
une tête ne vous revient pas,
il n'y a vraiment rien à faire.
Ce n'est pas comme ça
que je travaille.
Cela m'a beaucoup aidé
de parler au Dr Nathan.
L'écouter parler de son viol
- m'a aidé à ne pas me sentir seul.
- C'est merveilleux.
- C'est bien.
- Quelle est la prochaine étape ?
Tout dépend de vous.
J'aimerais prévoir une séance
avec votre femme.
Je ne suis pas encore
prêt à l'affronter.
Bien.
Peut-être devriez-vous
penser à parler
avec les hommes
qui vous ont attaqué.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Non.
Pas question.
Je suis pas une balance.
Je donnerai pas de noms.
- Pourquoi voulez-vous les protéger ?
- J'ai pas dit que je les protégeais.
Vous allez vous venger ?
- J'ai pas dit ça non plus.
- Peter.
Laissez tomber.
D'accord, pour le moment.
Je voudrais vous demander
encore quelque chose.
Quels sont vos rapports
avec le Directeur Glynn ?
Vous ne vous entendez pas.
Laissez tomber
ça aussi, ma Soeur.
Ouais, laissons tomber.
Hé, mon petit Peter.
Beau cul.
M. et Mme Machin
élèvent leurs mômes
pour qu'ils deviennent
de bons citoyens.
Ils leur apprennent les lois
du politiquement correct,
à respecter les autres races, sexes,
corpulences, les autres croyances.
Mais réfléchissez une minute.
Est-ce qu'en montrant trop
les différences à nos enfants,
on ne plante pas la même
graine de séparation ?
Est-ce qu'on rend
les enfants aveugles
pour qu'ils ne voient que nos
différences et pas nos similarités ?
Salut.
Tu te sens mieux ?
Ces anti-douleur
t'embrouillent le cerveau.
Tu es assis ici
depuis deux jours.
Tu parles pas,
tu manges pas avec nous.
Sans compter que tu m'as filé la
trouille avec ces histoires de gencives.
J'arrive pas à voir si les miennes
sont en recul ou pas.
Allez jouer, les filles.
Oui, monsieur.
- Vern.
- Ouais.
Je ne sais pas
qui est le donneur,
où ce putain de dentiste
a pris le tissu,
sur quel cadavre.
Ça pourrait être n'importe qui.
Arrête tes conneries.
C'est anonyme, ces conneries.
Ils les mettent
au frigo quelque part.
Comment je suis
censé savoir, moi ?
Me regarde pas comme ça.
- Quand est-ce que tu as appris ça ?
- Quand il me charcutait, après le gaz.
Cette tête de torchon,
ce suceur de merde,
il a joué avec ma tête
pendant l'opération.
Dieu tout puissant.
Elles sont de couleur normale
ces gencives, au moins ?
J'en sais rien.
- J'ai pas regardé.
- T'as pas regardé ?
T'es pas allé voir
le Dr Faraj pour savoir ?
Il est de retour jeudi.
Écoute, il faut que
personne ne le sache.
Surtout pas
au sein de la Confrérie.
Dis-moi, Vern,
ai-je raison de penser
que j'ai conduit 120 Kms
pour entendre cette histoire minable
parce que tu ne sais pas
quelles conséquences
Ie petit problème dentaire
de James Robson
risque d'avoir sur son statut
au sein de la Confrérie ?
- Oui, monsieur.
- Et tu y tiens à ce Robson.
- C'est ton ami.
- Oui, monsieur.
Voyons si tu peux répondre
à tes propres questions.
On verra si mon voyage
en valait la peine.
Définis-moi la pureté, Vern.
Tu vois, je ne suis pas inquiet
au sujet de James Robson.
Je ne l'ai jamais porté
dans mon cœur.
C'est le genre
à entrer dans la Confrérie
plus par crise
d'identité que par foi.
Monsieur, avec tout le respect que
je vous dois, il a fait ses preuves.
Avec tout le respect que je te dois, Vern, je
m'en branle.
Je m'inquiète pour toi,
et tes convictions
dans cette situation embarrassante.
J'ai peur que tu sous-estimes
l'infection de Robson
parce que vous êtes amis.
On est encore sûrs de rien.
Robson saura la vérité
dès qu'il le peut.
Souviens-toi.
Un peu de levure suffit
à faire lever un gros pain.
C'est vrai pour toi aussi.
La prochaine fois,
épargne-moi le voyage
et sers-toi du téléphone.
Au fait, James Robson
de l'unité B
m'a demandé une copie
de votre agenda de la semaine.
Il a quelque chose de moche
entre vous ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
- Rien.
Il était à cran,
beaucoup plus déprimé
que d'habitude.
Vous avez pas l'air
rassuré non plus.
Merde.
Merde.
Démissionner ?
A partir de quand ?
- Aujourd'hui.
- Aujourd'hui ?
Bon sang, Tariq, un peu
de préavis aurait été le bienvenu.
J'ai rien vu venir, Leo.
Vous ne pouvez pas
finir la semaine ?
Non, je finis ma journée
et c'est tout.
Voici des contacts
qui vous seront sans doute utiles.
D'abord Kochurn, et puis vous,
pourquoi mes dentistes partent tous ?
- Je suis désolé, Leo.
- Mon œil.
Vous devez avoir raison.
Rends-moi un service.
Fais circuler ça.
Ne dis pas d'où ça vient,
d'accord ?
Faraj devrait être ici.
Je vais le choper après le repas.
Jusque là tu veux pas parler,
c'est ça ?
Je fais ce que tout le monde
ferait dans cette situation.
Me fais pas chier.
- Juste de la soupe.
- T'es sûr que tu veux pas
un peu de merguez
et de sauce piquante avec ça ?
Quoi ?
On y va ?
Écoutez, tout le monde.
Notre Robson est allé chez le dentiste
se faire mettre des gencives de black.
- Merci, Vern.
- J'ai rien dit, putain.
Ta gueule, sale nègre !
Donne-lui de la soupe.
T'as entendu ça ?
Le mec a traité ton frère de nègre.
Fais pas le con.
Ou je t'arrange la mâchoire
avec cette cuiller.
On avance, les filles.
Il faut que je voie le Dr Faraj.
- Ma bouche me fait horriblement mal.
- Pauvre chou.
Suis-moi.
Bonjour, Dr Faraj.
C'est qui le putain de donneur ?
J'ai une femme et des enfants,
s'il vous plaît.
- Me fais pas déraper.
- Il était blanc.
Il était comme vous,
le même âge.
Prouve-le,
appelle le putain de labo.
Je vais vous le prouver.
Laissez-moi aller chercher
mon carnet d'adresses,
d'accord ?
- J'ai veillé à ce qu'il soit pas blanc.
- Merde !
Ce qui est fait est fait.
Garde !
Il m'a attaqué.
Ce doit être ses gencives
qui le rendent violent.
Bien...
Vous savez tous l'estime
que j'ai pour James Robson.
Malheureusement, le passé
est le passé.
C'est une très vilaine
victoire de Satan,
et cela m'attriste que Robson
en soit la victime.
Nous devons cependant suivre
nos principes, pas nos émotions.
A partir d'aujourd'hui, James Robson
ne fait plus partie du gang.
- Bonjour, Chris.
- Ma sœur.
Il faut me parler dans cette oreille,
l'autre ne marche plus très bien.
Oui, le Dr Nathan pense que la perte
d'ouïe pourrait être permanente.
J'aurai une bonne raison
d'ignorer les gens.
Elle dit aussi que vous serez renvoyé
en détention provisoire demain.
Juste à temps pour mon procès.
- Comment est votre nouvel avocat ?
- Je crois que je vais perdre.
- Qu'est-ce que ça vous fait ?
- Ça me met en colère.
J'ai pas envie de finir mes jours
en condamné à mort.
Je prierai pour vous.
- Vous croyez que Jésus était pédé ?
- Quoi ?
Vous croyez que Jésus était pédé ?
Question légitime.
Vous me provoquez,
vous vous moquez de ma religion ?
Non, j'ai besoin
d'un modèle à suivre.
Jésus était divin
et humain en même temps, non ?
Est-ce que la partie divine
contrôlait son appétit sexuel ?
Et si oui,
quelles sont mes chances ?
Je suis loin d'être divin.
Toute ma vie,
chaque fois
que l'envie me prenait,
j'ai fourré ma bite
dans n'importe quel trou
qui s'ouvrait
et se montrait disponible.
C'est ce qui m'a amené ici,
dans ce précipice de la mort.
Si j'avais pratiqué l'abstinence, aurais-je
été plus heureux ?
- Nous combattons tous notre nature.
- Pourquoi ?
Dieu nous donne une nature
pour qu'on la combatte ?
Cela prouve que nous sommes
plus que des animaux.
J'ai raté l'examen.
- Vous ne devriez pas dire ça.
- Quoi ? J'entends rien.
J'ai vu que les aryens avaient
attrapé ton ami Adam.
Oui, c'est ma faute.
Comment ?
J'ai pas envie d'entrer
dans les détails salaces.
- J'ai livré Adam à Schillinger.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que Schillinger pouvait
s'arranger pour que je voie Keller.
L'ironie de l'histoire est que je n'ai pas vu
Keller, il était à l'hôpital
quand je suis arrivé
en détention provisoire.
Donc pour assouvir tes désirs,
sexuels ou autres,
- tu as sacrifié un garçon ?
- Je croyais qu'Adam méritait le viol.
Il a violé cette fille,
et il m'a agressé aussi.
Mais quand je l'ai vu
dans le gymnase,
j'ai réalisé que quoi qu'il ait pu faire,
personne ne mérite ça.
Je suis dévoré
par la culpabilité.
Avec raison.
Comment puis-je faire la paix
avec moi-même ?
Je pourrais te le dire,
- mais veux-tu l'entendre ?
- Vas-y.
Cette calamité a été provoquée
par ton besoin de voir Keller,
donc la seule façon de te punir
- c'est de t'en priver.
- Ne pas le voir.
C'est cela.
Plus jamais ?
C'est cela.
Bon Dieu.
Si tu es sincèrement désolé,
c'est ce que tu dois faire.
Je veux qu'on me transfère
sur un autre lieu de travail.
Tu as demandé ton transfert au courrier
il y a à peine une semaine.
Je ne m'y plais pas
autant que je l'avais pensé.
- Des problèmes avec Schillinger ?
- Non, j'ai réalisé
que pousser un chariot n'est pas la
meilleure façon d'utiliser mes facultés.
- Soeur Peter Marie t'a déjà remplacé.
- Je sais.
- Il y a l'usine de vêtements féminins.
- C'est très bien.
Faire des ourlets c'est une meilleure
utilisation de tes facultés ?
Me raconte pas de conneries.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Rien.
Bien.
C'est une prison,
pas une agence pour l'emploi.
On essaie d'arranger les gens
mais on ne peut pas toujours.
Tu as demandé
à travailler au courrier.
Tant que tu ne m'auras pas donné
une bonne raison de partir, tu y restes.
J'ai une livraison spéciale
pour le Dr Nathan.
- Je peux vous aider ?
- Où est Soeur Pete ?
- En réunion.
- Vous êtes le shérif de l'unité J ?
Oui, Alvin Yood.
- Je suis Tobias Beecher.
- Salut.
- C'était mon travail avant.
- Et tu l'as quitté ?
- Oui.
- Le prends pas mal, mais c'est idiot.
Quand Soeur Pete reviendra
de son rendez-vous,
vous pourriez lui donner ce mot
et lui demander
de voir Adam Guenzel ?
Il est en unité B et je crois qu'il a besoin de
quelqu'un à qui parler.
- Parler de quoi ?
- Elle comprendra quand elle le verra.
D'accord, je lui donnerai
ton message.
Merci, à plus tard.
Beecher,
méfie-toi de la monnaie de singe.
- Comment vas-tu, Adam ?
- Qu'est-ce que ça peut te faire ?
Écoute,
je suis désolé
de les avoir laissés te violer.
Mais c'est cet endroit,
j'ai le cerveau complètement niqué.
Moi aussi.
Il faut qu'on soit là
l'un pour l'autre.
Pourquoi ? Tu veux emprunter
mon rouge à lèvres ?
Guenzel, Soeur Peter Marie
demande à te voir.
- Pour quoi faire ?
- Te mettre une Pampers sur la tête.
Hé, tarlouze, viens ici.
Écoute.
Tu ferais mieux de pas lui raconter
ce qu'on t'a fait.
- Oui, monsieur.
- Et enlève cette merde de ta face.
C'est tout ?
- Vous n'avez rien d'autre à dire ?
- Non, madame.
Parlez-moi de votre relation
avec Tobias Beecher.
J'ai pas de relation
avec Beecher.
On a partagé une cellule,
c'est tout.
Et quand vous étiez dehors ?
Nos familles se connaissaient,
mais il a 10 ans de plus que moi.
On a jamais traîné ensemble.
Et si je te disais
qu'il s'inquiète pour toi ?
Je vous dirais qu'il ment
comme un suceur de bites.
Excusez mon langage.
J'ai entendu pire.
- Pourquoi est-ce qu'il ment ?
- Il le sait.
- Vous ne voulez pas me le dire ?
- Demandez-lui.
Mon rôle dans ces séances
est d'agir en médiateur, en arbitre.
Aujourd'hui je vais être
plus agressive.
Le sujet du jour
est Adam Guenzel.
Je l'ai rencontré
quand il est arrivé à Oz.
Depuis, son comportement a changé
de façon significative.
Il est clair qu'il a été victime
d'abus sexuels,
et je vous soupçonne
de connaître les détails.
Tobias ?
Il a été violé il y a environ
une semaine, un viol collectif.
Par qui ?
Je ne suis pas là
pour faire le détective.
Je veux juste aider ce garçon.
- Vern ?
- Je ne sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
Said,
pouvez-vous nous éclairer ?
Non.
Bien.
Je veux que vous sachiez
que je ne m'en tiendrai pas là.
Je vais voir Adam Guenzel
tous les jours
jusqu'à ce qu'il s'ouvre à moi
et puisse me dire exactement
ce qui s'est passé.
La séance est terminée.
Je suis malade à l'idée de respirer
le même air que vous.
Adam Guenzel
est devenu un poids.
Tu crois qu'il va tout déballer ?
Hé, tarlouze, viens ici.
Oui, monsieur ?
J'ai une bonne nouvelle.
On va t'aider à t'évader.
Beecher, il y a du nouveau.
Adam Guenzel est mort.
Quoi ?
On vient de retrouver son corps.
Il était en train d'essayer
de passer le grillage pour s'évader.
Il a passé le fil barbelé
mais ensuite...
- Il s'est fait électrocuter.
- 4 000 volts lui sont passés à travers.
Putain.
Je suis désolé.
Donc, cette route vers l'enfer
est-elle faite
de bonnes intentions ?
Je ne dis pas de faire un détour,
mais avant de faire
le premier pas,
réfléchissez aux conséquences.
Parce que le bien peut devenir le mal
en un clin d'œil.
Voici quelques faits effrayants
à propos de l'impuissance :
Entre 10 et 20 millions
d'Américains en souffrent,
et dans 85% pour
des causes physiques
n'ayant rien à voir
avec leur pénis.
Dans 10% des cas,
les causes sont psychologiques,
et dans 5% des cas,
ce qui est effrayant,
la cause de l'impuissance
est inconnue.
Putain...
Me fais pas ça, Vern.
Vous autres, vous êtes
tout ce que j'ai.
Je n'ai pas le choix, James.
On a un code à suivre.
Et tu le connais bien.
Mais j'ai demandé
au dentiste.
Le donneur était
un homme blanc.
- Blanc.
- Vraiment ?
Parce que le bleu que Dr Faraj
t'a collé est bien bleu.
Ce qui me fait croire que t'as pas
obtenu ce que tu voulais.
Demain, tu changes
de cellule.
Voilà Robson.
Tu avais raison, Imam.
Allah l'a puni
pour ses péchés.
- Ça va, ta bouche ?
- Arif.
Va te faire foutre.
Robson.
J'ai pitié de toi,
malgré tout ce que t'as fait.
Dieu essaye de t'apprendre
quelque chose.
Sois malin et écoute.
C'est ça.
Il me dit que mes amis
vont me reprendre.
Ils n'auront pas le choix.
Tiens, voilà mon demi-frère.
C'est bon de parler avec
la bouche d'un noir, non ?
J'ai besoin de came.
Toi ? Toute cette moralité arienne,
c'était que des foutaises ?
Ferme ta grande gueule
et passe-moi la came.
- Ou je peux la vendre ailleurs.
- Ok, c'est bon.
Putain ! Garde ! Garde !
Une des causes physiques
de l'impuissance
est l'absence
d'érections spontanées.
En d'autres termes,
tu peux pas bander...
parce que tu bandes pas.
Et tu bandes pas
parce que
tu peux pas bander...
Enfin bref,
t'es vraiment baisé, quoi.
Merde, je peux pas bander.
Miguel Alvarez est de nouveau candidat
à la liberté conditionnelle.
Et alors ? On va la lui refuser,
comme la dernière fois.
Peut-être pas.
Tim, allons.
Avec toutes ses conneries,
le comité va pas le libérer.
Alvarez a changé.
- Il essaye de se tenir à carreau.
- Foutaises !
Je sais qu'il a fait du bon boulot
avec le chien d'aveugle,
mais c'est pas un cabot qui va
effacer son passé criminel.
Je vais par écrit demander
au comité sa libération.
Et Alicia Hinden, la responsable
du programme, va me suivre.
Et si Ray Mukada était là,
il ferait la même chose.
Tim, vous croyez vraiment
que Miguel Alvarez
est réhabilité ?
II y a six mois,
ce cinglé était en isolement,
à retapisser sa cellule
de merde.
Je sais que vous avez eu
vos différends avec lui,
depuis son arrivée même.
Et ça me rend inapte à le juger ?
Je vous emmerde !
Lui avez-vous parlé
depuis sa sortie d'isolement ?
- Et vous lui devez pas ça au moins ?
- Je lui dois ?
Pas de directeur à prisonnier,
mais d'homme à homme.
Si quelqu'un essaye de changer,
- ne devrait-on pas la soutenir ?
- Pas dans son cas.
- Leo...
- Non, putain ! Non !
Écrivez donc vos putain de lettres
de recommandation, ok ?
Je vais appeler Steve Dawkins
et mettre fin à ce merdier.
Merci d'avoir organisé
cette audience, McManus.
Pour être franc,
ces audiences
de liberté conditionnelle...
tes chances d'être libéré
sont vraiment minces.
Non, non, moi,
je le sens bien.
Et je vais bien me tenir.
Ça serait vraiment super
de sortir d'Oz.
Je pourrais revoir Maritza.
Elle est sortie de prison.
Elle a un travail
et s'est remise sur les rails.
Je pourrais peut-être même
avoir un autre enfant.
Il faut juste que
je montre ça au comité
et qu'ils comprennent
que j'en suis capable.
Je sais, au fond de moi,
que je suis prêt.
C'est un plaisir
de faire votre connaissance.
Oui, mon... père
et mon grand-père
ont aussi été
incarcérés ici.
- Pardon ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Je pratique un peu mes réponses
pour mon audience.
Décompte !
Pas mal, mon garçon.
Hé, Charlie Brown.
Maritza.
Maritza...
- Va te faire foutre.
- Fais gaffe, Miguel.
Faudrait pas faire une grosse tâche
sur ta demande de mise en liberté.
Fermez vos gueules !
Tu sais ce qui serait tragique ?
Si juste avant ta sortie,
Maritza...
avait un accident.
Si tu lui fais du mal...
t'es mort.
Si tu fais foirer mon audience,
t'es mort.
T'es beau quand
t'es en colère, tu sais ?
M. Alvarez, votre petit discours
était bien émouvant,
mais maintenant
on a des questions.
M. Dawkins, demandez-moi
tout ce que vous voulez.
Vous avez été condamné pour avoir
battu un homme de 75 ans
et l'avoir défiguré parce que
sa voiture avait éraflé la vôtre.
Je n'étais pas
moi-même ce jour-là.
Une fois arrivé ici,
vous vous êtes ouvert le visage
et avez essayé
de vous pendre.
Etiez-vous vous-même
ces jours-là ?
L'année dernière, vous avez essayé
de vous échapper d'Oswald.
Pas du tout.
Busmalis creusait un tunnel,
et je craignais pour ma vie...
Vous étiez meneur
pendant les émeutes
et avez blessé beaucoup de gens,
dont l'Agent Joseph Mineo.
Il allait me...
Plus tard, vous avez arraché l'œil
d'un autre agent, Eugene Rivera,
puis vous avez tué
deux prisonniers,
Carlo Ricardo
et Jorge Vasquez.
Ma question est
donc la suivante :
Qu'est-ce qui
vous fait croire
qu'on devrait vous libérer,
espèce de petit con ?
Ça suffit !
Ça suffit !
Lâchez-le, Alvarez !
Merde !
C'est quoi, cette merde ?
Je leur disais...
J'essayais de leur dire
que j'avais changé.
Putain de merde !
II m'a demandé
comment j'ai pu changer.
J'ai essayé de lui expliquer.
- Vous écoutez ?
- Faut qu'on parle de mon jugement.
Et il me coupe la parole.
Je suis tout seul.
J'ai peur !
- Vous m'écoutez ?
- Montgommery a eu ce qu'il méritait.
Le garde avait pas le droit
de me faire bouffer de la merde.
Sortez-moi de là !
- J'ai peur.
- Sale con.
Sortez-moi de là.
McManus !
C'est l'heure.
Tu m'as promis
de m'offrir un verre.
Et j'en ai besoin.
- On y va.
- Désolée, pas ce soir, Tim.
- Je veux pas laisser Pancamo.
- Tu sais...
on m'a souvent largué
pour d'autres types,
- mais jamais un type dans le coma.
- Il risque de mourir.
Et c'est de ma faute.
Il est arrivé avec
une blessure moindre
et a fait une infection.
J'ai manqué à mes devoirs
mais je vais pas
le laisser mourir tout seul.
- Tu veux un café ?
- Ok.
Tiens.
T'as jamais
rencontré ma femme...
enfin, mon ex,
Eleanor O'Connor ?
Pas encore, non.
Ça fait cinq ans
qu'on est divorcés.
Quand on m'a
offert ce boulot,
j'ai enfin réalisé le rêve
de bâtir Em City.
Mais elle a pas voulu suivre.
Elle avait un super boulot
et elle voulait pas partir,
alors je l'ai quittée,
et ça fait cinq ans
que je m'en sens coupable.
A chaque fois que quelque chose
tourne vinaigre,
je me dis :
"Putain...
je pourrais être avec Ellie,
et peut-être même
qu'on aurait des enfants..."
Me parle pas de regrets.
J'ai inventé le mot.
Ce que je voulais dire,
c'est que
quand je suis passé
en cellules d'isolement aujourd'hui,
je me suis retrouvé
face à face avec mes erreurs,
et j'ai cru que ma tête
allait exploser.
Puis j'ai repensé
à Omar White,
et à quel point il fut dur
de le faire changer.
Mais on a réussi.
Tu sais, on peut pas
tous les sauver,
mais si on n'en sauve
même qu'un,
et bien ça me suffit.
Et bien moi,
je veux sauver Pancamo.
Bon...
merci pour le café.
Je vais aller boire
un truc un peu plus fort.
Bonsoir.
- Je vais lui éclater la tête !
- Éclate-lui la tête !
Prisonnier #02C773 :
Wolfgang Cutler,
condamné le 20 février 2002
d'assassinat
avec une peine de prison
ferme à perpétuité.
Je veux entrer
dans votre groupe.
Tu connais la musique,
Wolfgang.
Il va falloir prouver
ton courage.
Quoi, que je bute quelqu'un ?
Qui ça ?
Tuer un nègre fait
généralement bon effet.
- Un meneur, si possible.
- Kareem Said.
Tu peux pas
choisir mieux.
Omar, tu veux
en entendre une bonne ?
J'ai entendu
les Aryens parler.
Le nouveau, Wolfgang Cutler,
disait aux autres
qu'il allait tuer Said.
C'est toi Cutler ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fous là ?
On s'en fout.
J'suis là parce que
j'ai entendu des rumeurs.
T'approche pas de Said, ok ?
Arrête tout de suite
tes manigances.
Je sais pas
de quoi tu parles.
Tire-toi de là.
J'essaye d'être diplomate, ok ?
Et moi je te dis de te casser !
Tu sais, je me suis calmé,
mais faut pas me provoquer.
- Tu touches à Said et...
- Et quoi ?
Tu vas pleurer, négro ?
Va te faire foutre !
- Connard. Connard.
- Putain.
- Connard.
- Va te faire foutre.
T'approche pas de lui.
Connard, je vais te...
Je vais te tuer, sale nègre !
Touche pas à Said !
T'approche pas de lui !
T'approche pas de Said !
T'approche pas de lui !
T'approche pas...
Putain.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Cutler ?
Cutler...
Allez, Cutler.
Cutler !
Allez, me fais pas ça.
Putain, crève pas !
Merde !
Merde !
Putain, merde !
Putain, j'ai failli le tuer !
J'ai rien fait, moi !
Ce salaud se foutait de moi...
je sais pas
ce qui s'est passé !
Omar, doucement.
De quoi tu parles ?
- Cutler va te faire la peau.
- Wolfgang Cutler.
Il est pas mort, ok ?
Dans une minute, les gardes
vont se ramener
et m'en foutre plein la gueule.
Putain ! Merde !
Omar, suis-moi
et ne t'arrête pas, ok ?
On y va.
Mais je lui ai sauvé la vie.
Et à Said aussi.
Quoi, et tu mérites
une médaille ?
Tu as failli tuer cet homme.
Tu comprends
ce que je racontes ?!
Ça fait 10 fois que je te donne
une deuxième chance
et c'est ainsi
que tu me remercies ?
Je me fous en quatre pour toi
et je me retrouve presque
avec un cadavre sur les bras.
Tu crois que ça me réjouit ?
McManus, ce n'est pas
si simple... Madame...
Si, ça l'est, Said.
Et ne t'attends pas
à ce qu'elle t'aide.
Ma décision est prise.
Les règles sont claires
et cette fois,
tu pars en isolement.
S'il avait fait ça
pour vous protéger,
vous l'y auriez envoyé aussi ?
La ferme ou tu pars avec.
McManus ! McManus !
Tout ça n'était pas
dirigé vers toi.
Non, c'était de la vraie rage.
Je m'en souviens bien.
Tim...
tu crois que
j'ai voulu divorcer
parce que tu voulais
venir ici à Oswald,
mais c'est faux.
Tu sais pourquoi
je suis partie ?
A cause de ton imperturbable
et inaltérable idéalisme.
T'aurais voulu que
je sois cynique ?
Non !
Mais tu veux sauver le monde,
et quand tu vois
que c'est impossible,
tu te crucifies et tu crucifies
tout le monde autour de toi.
Ce nonsense
qui te dit de tout changer
pour le mieux...
ta femme, tes prisonniers,
pour que tout se conforme
à ton idéal.
Tu devrais pas enfin voir
que ce n'est que de la fierté ?
- Continue.
- Non.
Je vais y aller.
Imam ?
Quelle que soit
la raison de votre visite...
ça peut attendre.
Je veux que vous ne
vous sentiez pas coupable
de ce qui est arrivé
à Omar White.
Comme je l'ai dit...
ça peut attendre.
Tu vas la fermer, putain ?!
L'impuissance peut aussi
être due à la dépression,
aux problèmes de couple, au stress
professionnel ou économique.
En effet, un petit salaire peut
rendre un homme tout mou.
Une chute du cours du marché
peut faire baisser le moral.
J'ai parlé à mon fils.
Alex Jr va bientôt mourir.
Bob, que vas-tu faire ?
Tout ce que je peux faire,
c'est attendre
qu'on m'annonce sa mort.
- Non, il faut que tu le voies.
- Et comment ça ?
II est en soins intensifs.
Il peut même pas
sortir de l'hôpital,
encore moins
venir ici.
- Alors faut que t'y ailles.
- Ils voudront jamais.
Pourquoi pas ?
McManus t'a toujours aidé.
Allez.
Va lui demander.
Vous pouvez me menotter,
m'attacher,
me bâillonner même,
tant que je peux le voir
et le regarder dans les yeux
afin qu'il sache que
son grand-père l'aime.
Je me souviens quand
vous avez fait une quête
pour l'emmener
au Parc de l'Aventure.
Ça lui a vraiment fait plaisir.
Et à moi aussi.
Non seulement
vous avez collecté l'argent,
mais vous avez impliqué
tout le monde.
Alors... puis-je aller le voir ?
Oui.
Et sans bâillon.
Sans chaînes non plus.
Je m'en occupe aujourd'hui.
- Viendrez-vous avec moi ?
- Non.
Je vous laisse à la porte.
J'ai été condamné à mort,
vous savez ?
J'en ai entendu parler.
Mais une panne d'électricité
a arrêté l'exécution.
Ma peine s'est donc transformée
en prison à vie...
automatiquement.
J'aimerais qu'il puisse se passer
la même chose pour Alex.
Mais Dieu seul peut
accorder un tel sursis.
- Chuck.
- Chuck.
- Chuck.
- Chuck.
Allez, on bouge tout ça...
C'est le meilleur épisode
de "Miss Sally".
Courrier !
Du courrier pour moi, Vern ?
M. Schillinger.
Ça pue le parfum
à deux balles.
Une lettre de Norma.
Fiona, tu peux
me rendre service ?
C'est une lettre
de mon ancienne fiancée.
Tu pourrais me la lire ?
Ça me donnerait l'impression
qu'elle est ici.
Si ça te fait mousser...
"Cher Agamemnon,
j'ai été très déprimée
quand "Miss Sally" a été annulé
- et que j'ai perdu mon travail".
- La pauvre.
"Mais ce qui me fait tenir,
c'est mon amour pour toi.
Je viendrai te voir le 15 de ce mois
pour t'expliquer pourquoi
je ne suis pas venue à notre mariage.
S'il te reste un peu
d'amour pour moi,
s'il te plaît, accepte.
Avec toute mon affection.
Norma".
- C'est-y pas mignon ?
- Le 15 ?
C'est aujourd'hui.
- Norma !
- Bonjour. Attends !
Surprise.
Hé, Bob,
comment s'est passée
ta visite à Alex ?
Je suis fatigué.
Devine ce qui s'est passé
pendant ton absence.
Je te raconterai demain.
Si tu veux, tu peux
m'en dire plus sur Alex.
Je n'ai plus rien à dire.
J'attends qu'on m'annonce
la nouvelle.
Je capitule.
Bob, il faut que tu dormes.
Tu as vu ça ?
Quoi ?
II est parti.
Au décompte !
L'état de votre petit-fils
était stable,
mais avec l'orage...
Il y a eu une brève
coupure d'électricité,
et la surtension
a brouillé les machines.
- Et ?
- Je suis désolé.
Alex est mort.
J'ai besoin d'aide.
Je suis désolé
pour Alex.
Tu sais...
on essaye de
se préparer à la mort,
mais on croit
toujours secrètement
qu'il se peut
que les médecins aient fait erreur,
ou qu'ils trouvent un remède,
et que tant que la personne
est en vie, il y a de l'espoir.
Et alors qu'on pense
se préparer au chagrin à venir,
tout ce qu'on fait, c'est espérer
qu'un miracle arrive.
C'est pourquoi c'est si dur
quand la mort arrive,
parce qu'on se rend compte...
on n'était pas prêt du tout.
Mais hier soir, tu savais.
D'une certaine façon, oui.
Il y a 30 ans, c'est
une panne d'électricité
qui m'a sauvé de la mort,
mais hier soir
l'électricité est revenue
pour finir le travail.
Sauf que tellement
de temps était passé
que c'est mon petit-fils
qui s'est retrouvé dans la chaise.
J'ai jamais vraiment
aimé ce chapeau.
Mais maintenant qu'il est mort,
je le comprends.
Il représente mon petit-fils
à son point le plus haut.
Je vais laisser Rebadow
assister aux funérailles.
Bon sang...
après 35 ans à Oz,
il sort deux fois cette semaine,
et pour les pires raisons.
Putain.
Me revoilà.
J'ai décidé...
de rendre son argent
à Rebadow
pour qu'il puisse
aider son petit-fils.
De nouvelles études montrent
que même le Viagra,
qui est censé aider
à maintenir une érection,
peut causer des problèmes
chez les jeunes hommes
qui l'usent de façon
purement récréationelle.
Car si une érection dure
plus de six heures,
la circulation sanguine
est coupée de façon permanente.
Mais bon, après six heures,
on en a plus rien à foutre.
Vous voyez ce
que je veux dire.
Ton père et moi avons assisté
aux funérailles d'Adam Guenzel.
Quand j'ai vu
Olivia traverser l'église,
bouffée par l'arthrite,
avançant un pas à la fois
à l'aide de sa cane,
mon cœur...
ça m'a brisé le cœur.
Quand tu as été arrêté,
Olivia Guenzel était l'une
des seules à nous soutenir,
et là on se retrouvait
soudain
à l'enterrement de son petit-fils,
qui lui avait causé tant de...
honte.
Je suis désolé.
Je n'ai pas pu
le protéger.
Je sais.
Tu as fait de ton mieux.
C'est drôle, car
quand je l'ai embrassée
et que j'ai vu la peine
dans son regard,
je me suis dit...
"Bien.
Maintenant tu comprends".
Que Dieu me pardonne.
J'allais oublier...
Holly t'a fait une surprise.
Joyeuse Saint Valentin.
- Winthrop...
- Laisse-moi tranquille, Beecher.
- Il faut qu'on parle.
- Je dois apporter ça à Schillinger
- sinon il va m'en coller une.
- Je sais ce que tu vis.
- Et t'es pas obligé d'être son esclave.
- C'est ça, ouais.
- Je peux t'aider.
- Comme tu as aidé Adam ?
Putain, non merci.
Ma Sœur, la dernière fois,
vous vous posiez des questions
à propos d'Adam Guenzel
et des circonstances
de son viol,
et je n'ai rien dit
parce que...
parce que j'étais impliqué.
Maintenant je me dis
que si j'avais parlé,
- Adam serait encore en vie.
- Beecher.
Vern, vous connaissez
la règle.
On interrompt pas.
Continuez.
Oui, continuez.
Il est trop tard
pour aider Adam,
- mais être honnête pourrait...
- Pourrait quoi ?
On commençait
à si bien s'entendre.
- Vern !
- Non.
S'il commence à faire
de fausses accusations,
tout votre dur labeur
va être réduit en miettes.
C'est ce que vous voulez ?
Je veux qu'il parle.
Je vais pas rester ici
à écouter ces conneries.
- Comme vous voulez.
- Beecher, fais très attention.
Dis la vérité, Tobias.
Dis la vérité.
Raccompagnez Said.
Beecher reste avec moi.
En accord avec le règlement
de cette prison,
notre comité vous a accordé audience
en bonne et due forme.
Nous avons écouté tous les témoins
et analysé les preuves,
et avons conclu ainsi :
Un, que vous avez organisé et
participé au viol d'Adam Guenzel,
deux, que vous avez organisé et
participé au viol de Franklin Winthrop.
Nous vous déclarons
donc coupable de viol aggravé
et avons décidé de
vous transférer immédiatement
en cellule d'isolement
jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
Jolie couleur.
Chris ?
- Comment s'est passé le jugement ?
- Super.
Mes concitoyens m'ont
déclaré coupable d'assassinat.
- Oh non.
- Et mes avocats vont faire appel,
mais sans grand espoir.
J'y retourne...
jeudi pour qu'ils prononcent
ma sentence,
et il est fort probable...
que je reçoive
la peine de mort.
Je ferai tout...
Je ferai tout pour vous aider.
Montrez-moi vos nichons.
Ne faites pas ça.
Je suis désolé.
Je suis mal viré.
C'est pas tous les jours
qu'on se fait condamner à mort.
Bizarre.
Pendant toutes ces années,
mon pénis a dominé ma vie,
ma forcé à suivre telle
ou telle direction...
de son choix.
A présent, je veux partager
mon amour avec quelqu'un et...
c'est impossible.
Il y a des gens qui se battent
contre la peine de mort.
Dites-le donc
à Shirley Bellinger.
Sur le chemin du retour,
je me demandais
comment je voulais mourir.
Il n'y a plus
que deux options :
L'injection et
la chaise électrique.
Je veux passer
sur la chaise.
Je veux sentir le jus.
Je veux mourir
de façon électrique.
Christopher Keller
a été déclaré coupable
du meurtre de Brice Tibbetts.
Tibbetts a été torturé, sodomisé
et tué en juillet 1997.
Le juge Grace Lema
annoncera sa sentence jeudi,
et il est fort probable
qu'il sera condamné à mort.
Keller est suspect dans
deux meurtres similaires.
Putain, faut que je le vois.
Souviens-toi de la promesse
que tu t'es faite.
Ouais.
Ce qui est bien quand on manque
à ses promesses à soi-même,
c'est qu'une seule personne
ne peut en souffrir,
- et que je peux vivre avec.
- Tu fais erreur.
Comment l'amour peut-il
être une erreur, Kareem ?
Comment l'amour
peut-il être mal ?
Surtout ici, à Oz,
où il se fait si rare.
Toi et moi,
nous nous aimons.
Tu as poignardé Schillinger
et Robson pour me défendre.
Mais les Aryens disent
que l'amour entre les races
est une perversité.
Et d'après qui ?
Qui décide quel amour
est permis ou non ?
Dieu.
Le Dieu que je prie...
aime tout le monde et
II a créé un univers
fait de différents peuples
et de différents amours.
Allah a dit :
"L'homme..."
Ne cite pas les écritures.
Tu sais ce qui va se passer
quand tu reverras Keller.
On va pas baiser.
Je veux juste qu'il sache
que je pense à lui,
et qu'il n'est pas
seul au monde.
Je crois qu'Allah
approuverait cela.
Et voilà ta nouvelle maison.
On dit que le fantôme de Shirley
Bellinger hante sa cellule.
- Ah ouais ?
- Quand c'est la pleine lune,
je peux encore
sentir son vagin.
T'es un sacré drôle, Lopresti.
Tu devrais faire
de la comédie.
Comment ça va ?
Chris.
T'as du courrier.
Le diabètes,
la sclérose en plaques,
la maladie d'Alzheimer
et de Parkinson,
l'hypertension artérielle,
l'obésité,
ou le vieil âge peuvent
être causes d'impuissance.
De même que le vélo.
Si vous vous mettez un siège
dur entre les jambes,
vous risquez de ne plus rien sentir
de dur entre vos jambes
pendant un sacré
bout de temps.
- Suce ma...
- Silence !
Allez.
Debout.
- Laisse tomber.
- Non.
Laisse tomber.
Espèce de mongol.
Courage, Cyril.
- On est où ?
- Au terminus.
Qu'est-ce que je fais là ?
Où est Jericho ?
- Du calme.
- Où est Jericho ?!
- Du calme.
- Jericho !
Ryan !
Vas-y, le mongol !
Ryan !
- Ryan !
- Vas-y, ma salope, exprime-toi !
Qu'est-ce que je fais ici ?
J'ai rien à faire ici !
Non !
- Les gardes ont dû le maîtriser.
- Nom de Dieu.
Je lui ai donné un calmant,
mais on sait très bien
que c'est qu'une
solution provisoire.
Ce n'est pas
une solution à long terme
aux crises de Cyril.
On n'a pas besoin
de solution à long terme.
Le juge a fixé son exécution
au mois prochain.
- Quoi ?
- Ça vous surprend ?
II a été déclaré coupable
du meurtre de Li Chen.
Et la sentence est la mort.
Il va falloir discuter
avec Cyril de la façon
dont il veut être exécuté,
par la chaise ou l'injection.
L'injection.
Je veux
qu'il s'endorme en paix.
Ce n'est pas exactement
l'effet de l'injection.
La substance injectée
le paralysera d'abord.
Passez-moi les détails, ok ?
Mais non, Ryan.
Vous avez jusqu'à présent
refusé d'aider votre frère.
Il est de votre responsabilité de savoir
comment cela va se passer.
- Je peux le voir ?
- Pas encore.
J'autoriserai une visite
quand il aura repris ses repères.
Ramenez-le à Em City.
La question n'est pas de savoir
si Cyril O'Reily est coupable ou pas.
La question est de déterminer
si le Huitième Amendement
de la Constitution,
qui nous protège
des traitements cruels,
peut protéger Cyril O'Reily,
dont le QI est de 51,
soit-il dit au passage.
C'est l'un des QI
les plus faibles
dans l'histoire
des condamnés à mort.
En tant que mère,
je fais appel
à tous les parents
qui nous écoutent
afin d'empêcher l'état
de commettre cet acte monstrueux.
Le Gouverneur Devlin s'est
refusé tout commentaire
sur la manifestation
tenue en ce moment même.
Tu sais, Meehan,
tu peux tenir 1000
conférences de presse,
mais ça ne sauvera pas
mon frère.
Si j'avais ton attitude,
t'aurais raison.
Mais je vais te prouver
que tu as tort.
Je vais te montrer
la puissance de la prière,
de l'espoir et de la foi
en notre Dieu tout Puissant.
Ok, ben tant que vous y êtes,
allez vous faire foutre,
Père Meehan !
Vous êtes venu
suivre une leçon ?
Non, je suis le seul séminariste
à avoir été renvoyé de la chorale.
Le chargé de classe m'a dit :
"Votre voix est
une offense à Dieu".
Vous avez tenu une formidable
conférence de presse.
- Merci.
- Un véritable tison.
J'ai l'habitude.
Je veux vous
parler de Ryan.
Depuis mon arrivée à Oz,
j'essaye qu'il s'ouvre à moi.
Je sais que Cyril et lui
ont été battus par leur père,
et que ça a dû vraiment les abîmer
psychologiquement.
Mais j'ai le sentiment
qu'il y a autre chose
que votre fils cache.
Un fait essentiel,
une peine plus profonde.
Je me demandais
si vous en saviez quelque chose.
Mon plus grand regret est
d'avoir abandonné mon fils.
Il n'était qu'un bébé
quand je suis partie,
et je n'avais eu aucun contact
avec lui jusqu'à récemment.
Y a-t-il quelqu'un d'autre
à qui je pourrais parler ?
Sûrement pas son père,
mais peut-être
sa tante, Brenda.
Merci beaucoup, Brenda.
Oui, nous faisons
tout notre possible pour Cyril.
C'est ça.
Continuez à prier.
Tous dans vos cellules !
Ryan, parle-moi
de Carolyn.
Putain, de quoi
tu parles ?
Carolyn, ta petite sœur.
Elle est morte,
un point c'est tout.
Non, ce n'est pas tout.
Raconte-moi
ce qui s'est passé.
Qui t'a raconté ça ?
Peu importe.
Parle-moi d'elle.
Non.
Elle est morte.
Elle avait à peine six mois,
elle est tombée de son berceau
et s'est rompu la nuque.
Pourquoi tu me fais ça ?
J'ai pu voir à quel point
tu aimes ton frère,
comment tu le protèges,
et pourtant tu es prêt
à le laisser mourir.
Je me demande pourquoi.
Je te l'ai déjà dit.
La mort est plus douce
qu'un jour à Oz.
C'est pas ce que les prêtres
rabachent tout le temps,
le bonheur de la vie éternelle
et toutes ces conneries
de cathos ?
As-tu une part de responsabilité
dans la mort de Carolyn ?
C'était toi qui t'occupais d'elle
quand elle est tombée ?
Je veux pas en parler.
J'en ai jamais parlé
à personne,
ni même à Cyril,
et ça va pas changer.
Alors, c'est ça ?
Tu te sens responsable ?
Non.
- Alors que s'est-il passé ?
- La ferme !
Ryan,
il est temps
de dire la vérité.
Cela fait trop longtemps
que tu portes ce lourd fardeau.
Tout ce que tu pourras me dire
restera entre nous.
- Non.
- Comme en confession.
Tu peux maintenant dire ce
que tu as à dire de sa mort.
Va te faire foutre !
Putain !
Merde !
- Non.
- Allez.
- Arrête.
- Allez.
Ça va... Dieu t'aime.
Je suis allé voir un prêtre
pour lui raconter la vérité
et il ne m'a pas cru.
Elle était si petite.
C'était ma petite sœur.
Je sais.
Dieu t'aime.
Dieu t'aime.
Soudain, me voilà une star.
J'ai fait six interviews
pour des journaux et la TV
depuis que cette histoire
avec ton frère a commencé.
Je dois dire que je prends
goût à tout ça.
Les copains chez Kelsey
m'offrent la tournée tous les soirs.
Y'a même une nana qui se met
toujours au bout du bar
qui me fait de l'œil.
Je pourrais me la faire.
Tu vas aller voir Cyril
tant que tu es là ?
Ouais...
Je devrais.
Je sais pas ce que
je vais bien pouvoir lui dire.
- Dis-lui que tu l'aimes.
- C'est ça, ouais.
Tu lui as déjà dit ?
A lui, à maman ? Hein ?
A Tessie, quand
vous étiez mariés ?
Les mots "Je t'aime" sont-ils
jamais sortis de ta bouche ?
Parce que moi,
j'en ai pas le souvenir.
Commence pas à geindre.
Pardon, je sais que
t'es sensible en ce moment.
Écoute, tu m'as demandé de venir,
alors dis ce que t'as à dire, ok ?
Je veux parler
de Carolyn.
Carolyn ? Et alors ?
Je veux parler
du jour où elle est morte.
Je me souviens
qu'elle pleurait,
elle n'arrêtait pas...
pendant des heures.
Tessie arrivait pas
à la calmer.
T'étais beurré et
de mauvais poil.
- Assieds-toi !
- Va te faire foutre !
Assieds-toi...
ou je finis l'histoire
devant les flics.
Carolyn pleurait
et tu l'as prise
des bras de Tessie
et tu as secoué
son petit corps.
Tu l'as secouée, tu l'as secouée,
jusqu'à ce qu'elle s'arrête,
jusqu'à ce que
son corps soit sans vie.
Elle est tombée
de son berceau.
Non.
J'étais là.
J'étais dans le couloir,
et j'ai tout vu.
T'étais qu'un gamin.
Qu'est-ce que
tu pouvais bien savoir ?
Mon ordure de père
m'en a foutu, des raclée.
Ma vie n'est
qu'une grosse merde,
et ce depuis que je suis né.
Et je n'avais pas de frère
pour me réconforter, comme toi.
J'ai été seul toute ma vie,
et bientôt...
tu vas savoir ce que c'est.
Je ne dirai rien
à personne
de ce qui est arrivé
à Carolyn.
Ça reste entre toi et moi.
Mais, papa...
t'as intérêt de prier très fort
que je sorte jamais
de cet endroit.
Parce que dès
que je sors d'ici...
je te descends.
Et...
je t'ai amené un copain.
- Jericho.
- Ouais.
Salut, copain.
Je t'ai manqué ?
Toi, tu m'as manqué.
Ma Sœur,
je voulais vous dire
que j'ai décidé d'être égoïste
et je vais pas permettre
qu'on tue Cyril.
Et s'il y a quoi que ce soit
que je puisse faire,
je vous soutiens à 100%.
Je suis heureuse
de l'entendre.
Hé, petit frère...
- Tu sais qui t'aime ?
- Toi, tu m'aimes.
Un peu, mon n'veu.
La drogue peut être
cause d'impuissance.
La marijuana, l'héroïne,
les stéroïdes...
ainsi que l'alcool et le tabac.
72% des hommes qui fument
plus de 20 paquets par an
souffrent de problèmes circulatoires
au niveau du pénis.
J'peux avoir un cendrier ?
C'est pas parce que
je vous renvoie à Emerald City
que vous n'avez pas
besoin de soins
et que vous pouvez arrêter
de prendre soin de vous.
- Ouais, ouais.
- Y'a pas de "ouais, ouais".
S'il le faut, je viendrai nettoyer
votre cathéter moi-même.
Vous trouvez ça drôle ?
Quand j'ai appris
que t'allais mieux
et que tu revenais, j'ai sauté de joie.
Laisse-moi t'aider.
J'ai pas besoin de ton aide.
Tu sais que je t'ai toujours
aimé et respecté.
Arrête tes conneries.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Tu sais que Burr s'est excité
quand t'es tombé malade.
Il m'a accusé
de t'avoir refilé la came.
C'est pourtant vrai.
Ouais, je sais.
Mais Burr a pas besoin
de le savoir.
Il croit que c'est Guerra,
alors notre traité de paix
avec les métèques
est barré en couille.
Burr et Morales
se sont bouffé le nez
et ont fini au trou.
Si Burr découvre que
tu m'as donné la came,
- il va te faire la peau.
- Ouais.
T'inquiète pas.
Je vais pas moucharder.
Je voulais de la came.
Peu importe d'où elle venait.
- Je le dirai à Burr.
- Super.
Merci.
Tu sais, si j'étais une nana,
je te lècherais la pomme.
Si t'étais une nana, tu serais
moche comme un poux !
Vous êtes tous les mêmes.
Je vous observais
de mon bureau
quand la bagarre a éclaté.
Je suis pas naïf
au point de croire
que vous allez m'expliquer
pourquoi vous vous êtes battus
et vous êtes pas naïfs au point
de croire que je vais rien faire.
Alors si vous voulez pas
que je vous renvoie d'Oz,
on va de nouveau
faire un marché :
Plus de violence
entre vous deux.
- Très bien.
- Redding ?
Si vous le dites.
C'est pas enthousiaste,
mais ça fera l'affaire.
Allez-y.
C'est donc Morales qui a filé
la came à Augustus ?
Morales ou un de ses clowns.
Je croyais que c'était les métèques,
mais je peux me tromper.
Alors qui ?
Comme je l'ai déjà dit,
Augustus va tout me dire.
J'aurais dû lui parler.
C'est pas touchant, ça ?
Je sais que j'ai pas
été juste avec vous
en me mettant
du côté de ce nègre
et en faisant baisser
vos ventes de came.
- Je suis désolé, ok ?
- Désolé ?
- Tu crois que ça fait l'affaire ?
- Mario.
Nous, les Siciliens,
on est mal compris.
Au fond,
on est un peuple
qui sait pardonner.
Ah ouais ?
Et ça va coûter combien,
ce pardon ?
Les 50% de Redding,
et 10% de ton blé.
- Ça va pas ?
- Chico.
Ok.
Mais à une condition.
Tu plantes Redding.
Avec plaisir.
Je me suis mis en colère quand j'ai su
que tu prenais cette merde.
Je voulais m'en prendre
à tout le monde.
Puis je me suis rendu compte
qu'en fait, je m'en voulais
de ne pas avoir vu
que tu étais
de nouveau mordu,
et que c'était de ma faute.
- Burr.
- Je mangeais la nourriture de ta mère,
à table avec vous,
assis à la place
de ton père.
Et tout ce temps-là, Eugenia ignorait
que je te filais cette merde,
que tu dépendais de moi.
Pourquoi j'ai fait ça ?
Pourquoi j'ai menti ?
Pourquoi j'ai fait du mal
à cette gentille fille ?
C'est comme tu disais, Burr,
la vie arrive
comme elle arrive.
Non, ça c'est des excuses.
On contrôle la vie.
Je t'ai rendu accro de ce truc
parce que je voulais
que tu dépendes de moi.
Parce que j'avais peur
que tu me quittes.
Et j'ai presque failli
te perdre pour toujours.
Burr...
c'est pas la drogue
qui m'a rapproché de toi.
Je t'ai toujours aimé.
Toujours.
Regarde-moi, j'ai l'air
d'une vieille pleureuse.
Burr, non ! Non !
Allez chercher un docteur,
nom de Dieu !
Redding, lâche-le !
Nom de Dieu.
Je...
je sens mes jambes.

Mon Combat
Oz, le nom
communément donné
à l'établissement
pénitentiaire d'Oswald,
à haute sécurité.
Ouais, c'est bien moi.
Vous me croyiez mort,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je le suis,
mais ça ne m'empêche pas
de continuer à papoter.
Et depuis l'autre côté
j'ai une vue
différente des choses.
Et je vois beaucoup
de têtes connues.
- Putain !
- Relax, putain !
C'est pas si mal.
Mourir est
plus dur
pour les vivants
que pour les morts.
La mort ne fait vraiment mal
qu'à ceux qui restent.
- Tim, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Eh, viens par là.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
Tu te prends pour Picasso ?
Non, c'est pas de l'art,
c'est un labyrinthe. De réflexion.
D'accord.
C'est quoi un labyrinthe
de réflexion ?
Si t'as un problème
que tu essaies de résoudre,
tu entres dans le labyrinthe.
Et alors que tu avances,
tu te concentres
pour trouver le bon chemin,
ce qui stimule
ton raisonnement.
Et quand
tu arrives au bout,
on peut espérer que tu aies
résolu ton problème.
Ah ouais, j'oubliais.
T'es allé à un séminaire
du Nouvel Age la semaine dernière.
Tant de personnes sont mortes
depuis l'ouverture de Em City,
je commençais
à devenir insensible.
Mais Augustus Hill...
Ça m'a vraiment secoué.
Je sais pas. Un labyrinthe
c'est un peu idiot,
mais on ne sait jamais.
Si ça marche...
faut qu'on essaie, non ?
Bien sûr, mais...
tu sais,
sans vrais murs,
ces zizis vont juste
enjamber la ligne.
Après la mort d'Augustus,
quand nous avons
vidé son casier,
j'ai trouvé cette boîte.
Sur le couvercle
il est écrit
"Ne pas ouvrir avant six mois
après ma mort".
Alors j'ai décidé
de respecter sa volonté.
Ce matin,
six mois exactement,
j'ai regardé dedans.
Et alors ?
"J'ai le pressentiment qu'aujourd'hui
est le dernier jour de ma vie.
Ou c'est peut-être
pas un pressentiment.
A Oz, chaque jour
pourrait être le dernier.
Bref, je prends la précaution
de sceller cette boîte.
A l'intérieur, vous... j'entends
par là McManus, Burr et Said...
trouverez un manuscrit que j'ai écrit
au cours des six dernières années.
Si vous lisez cette lettre,
mon pressentiment était juste,
et je suis mort.
Ces pages sont donc
mes dernières volontés, mon testament.
Ma volonté de survivre.
Mon témoignage de
tout ce que j'ai vécu à Oz.
"Je vous demande
de lire mes mémoires
et d'en faire ensuite
comme bon vous semblera".
Je veux rien avoir
affaire là dedans.
Eh, Baba.
Content de te revoir.
T'as l'air en forme.
J'ai frôlé la mort,
mais grâce au Docteur Nathan,
je m'en suis sorti.
- Quoi de neuf ?
- La came circule librement,
surtout avec les nègres
hors circuit.
La mort d'Augustus Hill
les a vraiment détruits.
- Redding aussi ?
- Je le comprends pas.
Frankie Urbano essaie de
le poignarder, il tue Hill,
et Redding n'essaie pas
de se venger.
- Redding prépare quelque chose.
- Ouais, mais quoi ?
Tue le blanc !
Va te faire foutre, enculé !
OK, dispersez-vous.
Y'a rien à voir ici.
Ç'est fini, allez.
Tu regardes ça ?
Redding ?
Pendant que tu pleurniches,
tes hommes se déchaînent.
La perte d'Augustus
les a bouleversés,
- que veux-tu que j'y fasse ?
- Prends le contrôle.
Bon sang,
j'aurais cru que tu serais content
de me voir rester dans l'ombre...
te donner une chance de convertir
tous mes gars à l'lslam.
Il y en a qui
ne trouveront jamais Dieu,
Ça n'empêche
qu'il leur faut un chef.
Et tu es leur chef.
Mais pour l'instant
tu ne dirige pas vraiment.
T'es là, à pleurer
sur Augustus,
c'est bien,
et tu t'en veux,
c'est bien.
Mais quelle différence si tes émotions
ne se traduisent pas par des actes ?
Si le meurtre d'Augustus
est dû à la drogue
et que tu "ne veux pas voir
d'autres jeunes mourir"...
c'est bien.
Eloigne tes hommes de la drogue.
- Comment ?
- Je sais pas.
La réponse est en toi.
Quand tu l'auras trouvée,
alors tu sera enfin
totalement un chef.
En attendant, tu ne fais
que gaspiller de l'air.
J'veux vous parler
d'après la mort...
Exécuté par injection à Oz
La vie après la mort.
Les grecs de l'antiquité croyaient
que quand un type mourait,
il montait en bateau,
traversait le Styx et allait
à un endroit appelé Les Enfers.
Tout le monde
allait aux Enfers.
Les bons
comme les méchants.
C'est un endroit
où on a tous une place.
Mais les grecs,
ils comprenaient.
Le fait d'avoir vécu,
de s'être emmerdé
à se lever chaque jour
était assez pour mériter
une récompense éternelle.
Bonjour, les garçons.
Aujourd'hui
c'est le grand jour.
Vous allez tous aller
vous lamenter et pleurnicher
devant la commission
d'évaluation
en espérant qu'ils
vous sortent d'isolement.
Bien qu'on se demande pourquoi
vous voudriez quitter ce paradis.
Mon pote McManus,
il va me soutenir.
Il va me sauver.
J'ai une chance sur deux.
Glynn est une enflure.
Cet enculé ne me laissera jamais sortir.
Vous allez voter
pour moi, hein, Howell ?
J'vous sucerai
votre grosse chatte !
Où est le petit déjeuner ? Hein ?
Qu'est-ce que
tu putain de regardes ?
- Vous.
- Recule.
Forcez-moi.
Comment tu savais
que j'avais envie
de cuisine mexicaine ?
- Je suis portoricain.
- Même chose.
Déshabille-toi.
Martinez baise Howell.
- Encore ?
- Il doit vouloir passer un coup de fil.
Merde.
Nous allons procéder
à notre revue biannuelle
des détenus en isolement,
qui, malheureusement,
sont en surnombre.
Soit nous en remettons certains
avec les autres détenus
ou nous les expédions dans
un autre établissement pénitentiaire.
On commence par qui ?
Henry Stanton.
En isolement cellulaire pour avoir
poignardé Montgomery dans le cou.
Tu vas la fermer !
Montgomery
n'est même pas mort.
Il ne peut juste
plus chanter.
Suivant ?
Vern Schillinger, pour le viol
de Franklin Winthrop
et d'Adam Guenzel.
Je vous dis que c'était consensuel.
Demandez à Winthrop.
Miguel Alvarez. A frappé un membre
de la commission de contrôle.
J'avais de trop
grands espoirs.
Je ne recommencerai pas.
- Omar White, il...
- Il a étranglé un Aryen.
- Enculé !
- Ensuite il a sauvé la vie du type.
Suivant.
Greg Penders,
a entraîné un clebs de garde
à attaquer l'agent Lopresti.
Lopresti va bien,
pas une égratignure.
Carlos Martinez a jeté un cocktail
au visage de Dave Brass.
- Enculé !
- Ouais, à la suite de quoi
Les gardes lui ont
fait la peau.
Martinez est une ordure. On ne devrait
surtout pas le sortir d'isolement.
Lui et Penders ont tous les deux
attaqué des gardes.
Pas question qu'ils
rejoignent les autres.
Des recommandations
pour les autres ?
Stanton et Schillinger
pourraient sortir.
Schillinger ? Certainement pas.
S'il sort il va faire quelque chose
- pour saboter l'évaluation de Beecher.
- Miguel Alvarez.
Je le veux à Em City.
Il s'efforce de changer.
White aussi.
Vous n'en parlez pas.
Je peux aider Alvarez.
Je ne peux rien faire
de plus pour Omar.
Putain.
Eh, Omar !
On va passer
du temps ensemble.
Qu'est-ce que vous braillez ?
McManus t'a laissé
dans mes bras douillets.
Non, attendez. Laissez-moi
lui parler, j'vous en prie.
Et tu feras quoi pour moi ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Tu feras mes chaussures ?
Non, je m'appelle pas
Pullman Porter.
- Déshabille-toi.
- Ben, euh...
Ecoutez...
Je, euh...
J'me sens pas très bien.
Déshabille-toi.
Dépêche,
j'ai d'autres choses à faire.
Je vous ai dit
que j'étais malade.
Tu sais quoi ?
Aujourd'hui
t'es cireur de chaussures !
Mince !
Je crache de
toutes sortes de couleurs.
Ma... ma pisse est
comme en feu.
Des suées nocturnes ?
Du mal à dormir ?
Non.
- Je devrais le garder.
- Pourquoi, qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je vais faire des examens.
Si tu fais semblant,
trouduc,
j'me tape
tes couilles en gratin.
Nous avons décidé,
par quatre voix contre trois,
- de te sortir d'isolement.
- Vous déconnez ?
Non. Tu reviens à Em City.
McManus
s'est mouillé pour toi.
- Va pas le baiser avec tes conneries.
- Moi, non. J'vais pas déconner.
Mais j'peux pas
contrôler mes ennemis.
Ça suffit ! Arrête !
C'était pour quoi,
cette petite bagarre avec Torres ?
Je sais pas.
Il est cinglé.
D'accord, Chico.
Tu sais, j'ai fait
ma petite enquête,
et j'ai pu rassembler
des informations
qui pourraient t'intéresser.
C'est à propos d'Alvarez.
Chaque problème qu'il a eu
depuis environ cinq ans
- t'est relié d'une façon quelconque.
- Moi ? Non.
Alors je te préviens.
Si Miguel a d'autres problèmes
tu seras responsable.
Et maintenant qu'on a
des places libres en isolement,
s'il y a
le moindre problème
je t'y expédie...
- Attendez un peu !
- ... à moins que vous deveniez amis.
Miguel.
On parlait
justement de toi.
Guerra a quelque chose
à te dire.
Ouais.
Tu sais...
toi et moi, on a
d'abord été amis,
et bien qu'il y ait eu
beaucoup de merdes entre-temps...
on pourrait peut-être...
Ouais, Chico.
Serrez-vous la main.
Extinction des feux.
Faites de beaux rêves.
Je t'ai vu faire la paix
avec Alvarez.
- T'étais sérieux ?
- Tu veux la vérité ?
Je sais pas. Je l'ai détesté
pendant tant d'années,
je sais même
plus pourquoi.
Et aujourd'hui j'ai failli
me faire couper la gorge.
Ça m'a fait réfléchir.
T'as déjà eu l'impression
d'avoir perdu ton appétit
- pour toutes ces conneries ?
- Ouais, quand ma sœur
est morte dans
l'accident de bus.
C'est vrai, tu parlais de paix
et de patience à l'époque.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- Oz.
Voilà ce qui s'est passé.
Putain d'Oz.
Les ltaliens pensent
très différemment
à la vie après la mort.
Ce type, Dante,
décrit l'enfer comme une série
de petits cercles
où les pécheurs sont tourmentés
par une punition
reflétant leur crime.
Les flagorneurs sont enterrés
dans la merde jusqu'au cou.
Les avocats portent
des vêtements qui piquent.
Pensez-y un peu.
Qu'est-ce qui serait
pour vous
une torture éternelle ?
Votre belle-mère ?
La voix de Britney Spears ?
Pour moi, ce serait
une grosse paire de seins
que je serais à deux doigts
de pouvoir attraper.
Merde !
A l'appel !
Bonjour, Bob.
Bob ? Tu se sens mieux ?
Redding, Vern.
Numéro 01R289.
Rebadow.
Numéro 65R814.
Où est Rebadow ?
La peine, c'est comme une vague.
Faut qu'elle passe.
Et même si tu te sens mal,
tu vas mieux
que le jour du décès
de ton petit fils.
C'est difficile à croire
parce que ma tristesse n'arrête pas
de prendre une forme différente.
Ce matin... ou plutôt hier soir
puisque je dors à peine...
j'étais... miné
par le fait que le nom
Rebadow va disparaître.
J'étais fils unique,
mon fils est mon seul enfant,
son fils était
son seul enfant.
Après nous,
la famille aura disparu,
comme une espèce d'insecte
anéantie par la pollution.
Ma pollution.
Je sais pas pourquoi
cette importance
de transmettre notre nom,
comme si ça justifiait
notre existence.
La maladie de mon petit-fils
a tellement rempli
ma vie et mon cœur.
Sa mort a laissé un vide.
Faut rester actif,
te concentrer sur ton travail.
Tu aimes travailler
à l'atelier de couture, non ?
Non, pas du tout.
L'idée d'entendre
le bruit horrible
de ces machines
du matin au soir...
D'accord,
je vais te transférer.
Tu préfèrerais pointer où ?
Je ne suis pas...
J'adore lire.
La bibliothèque ?
C'est ce qui est prévu
au budget actuel.
- Vous pouvez obtenir plus ?
- Je peux essayer.
- Leo ?
- Tim.
Je vous présente la nouvelle
responsable de la bibliothèque.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
J'ai appris que
vous étiez ici.
Stella nous arrive de Boston
où elle a travaillé en bibliothèques
municipales pendant 16 ans.
Je dois avouer
me demander
- pourquoi vous êtes ici.
- Quitter le confort de Boston
pour venir
me perdre à Oswald ?
C'est simple.
J'adore lire.
Et si je peux inciter
les prisonniers à prendre un livre,
Leurs vies en seront
peut-être légèrement changées.
But admirable.
Tâche difficile.
Je viens du Nord.
Pour moi, "non" signifie
"redouble d'efforts".
Bien. Euh, écoutez
ça m'ennuie de faire ça
dès votre arrivée,
- mais j'ai besoin d'une faveur.
- Bien sûr.
Il y a un détenu
du nom de Rebadow.
C'est parti.
Vous êtes le premier.
Vous avez dû apprendre que
le John Grisham est enfin arrivé.
Je ne lis pas
cette foutaise.
Pardon, je ne voulais
pas vous vexer.
- Vous êtes Mme Coffo ?
- Mlle Coffo, en fait.
Je m'appelle Rebadow.
On m'a envoyé
pour travailler avec vous.
Mais je suis pas un bleu.
Je connais parfaitement
le système de classification.
Je peux vous dire où se trouve
n'importe quel livre.
Super. Je dois vous prévenir cependant.
Je ne vais pas attendre
que les détenus
viennent à moi.
Je veux identifier ceux qui
ne s'intéressent pas à la lecture,
ceux qui ne savent
même pas lire.
Je veux leur mettre
un livre dans mains,
et la clé sera
de trouver le bon.
Je m'en remettrai à vous.
Vous pouvez
compter sur moi.
Vous avez un prénom ?
Robert,
bien que la plupart des types ici
m'appellent Bob.
Je vous appellerai Robert.
Vous pouvez m'appeler Stella.
Bienvenue à bord.
Eh, je vais rencontrer
ton nouvel avocat aujourd'hui,
un musclé du barreau
trouvé par Meehan.
- Je peux venir avec toi, maintenant ?
- Pas encore, mais bientôt.
T'as l'air vachement optimiste.
J'essaie de l'être,
mais c'est pas...
comment dirais-je ?
Mon fort ?
- Alors, la bouffe, ça vient ?
- Tiens, mange, putain de poilu.
Eh, tout le monde,
voici le nouveau
membre du club.
Kirk, espèce d'enculé !
Tu devrais être mort,
petit connard !
T'inquiète, c'est pas
ta faute si je suis vivant.
En fait,
je ne peux pas mourir.
Conneries.
Donne-moi une autre chance.
Ça servira à rien.
Je ne peux pas mourir.
Ouais, pourquoi ça,
mon chéri ?
Parce que...
je suis Satan.
Et Satan ne mourra jamais.
- Bonjour, Pete.
- Ray.
Je suis tellement contente
que vous soyez de retour.
Merci.
J'aimerais en dire autant,
mais je n'en suis pas sûr.
Faut que vous sachiez.
Kirk est au couloir
de la mort.
Il vous demande.
- Aucune chance.
- Bien, écoutez...
Pete, deux prêtres
de ma paroisse
ont été brûlés vifs,
dans un incendie commandité par Kirk,
par rancune et malveillance.
Il sera exécuté
dans quelques semaines.
Il veut peut-être
votre pardon.
- Son âme...
- Son âme va pourrir en enfer.
Seul Dieu peut en décider.
Esprit Saint à bord.
- Dis bonjour, Jericho.
- Bonjour, mon Père.
Eh, Mukada.
Regarde-moi
cette ordure là-bas.
J'vais te tuer,
putain d'enculé !
Merci beaucoup
d'être venu.
- Bon, abrège.
- Faut que je parle avant son retour.
- Qui ça ? Lopresti ?
- Satan.
Ecoutez, mon Père.
Je sais que
vous me détestez et
que j'ai commis des atrocités,
mais ce n'était pas moi.
Je suis possédé
par le diable.
- Arrête.
- Je suis possédé,
et vous seul pouvez m'aider.
- J'ai besoin d'être exorcisé...
- Arrête, j'ai dit.
Je vois clair dans ton jeu.
Tu veux faire appel
en plaidant l'aliénation mentale ?
Non. Je vous en prie,
mon Père. Il arrive !
En suggérant même
ce que tu suggères,
tu te moques
de ma religion.
Au revoir, Kirk.
Je te verrai
à ton exécution.
Mukada !
Tu peux t'en aller,
mais je ne suis pas
comme le révérend Cloutier.
Je ne vais pas
disparaître comme ça.
Nous travaillons
avec des criminels.
Nous essayons
de comprendre
pourquoi ils ont enfreint
la loi afin de les aider.
Nous étudions
les éléments psychologiques
et sociologiques. Nous étudions
leurs antécédents familiaux,
Leur environnement,
leurs accoutumances, etc.
A défaut de cure, il y a
habituellement une explication.
Mais parfois nous sommes
confrontés à une réalité
plus grande,
plus incroyable.
Nous faisons face
au mal à l'état pur,
et nous sommes impuissants.
Pas d'espoir
de salut pour Kirk.
Il est le mal à l'état pur.
D'accord, le mal
existe dans le monde.
Mais nous ne sommes pas
impuissants face à lui.
Vous et moi avons
dévoué nos vies
à surmonter le mal
à travers l'amour.
L'amour de Dieu.
Entrez.
- Bonjour.
- Monseigneur.
Ma sœur,
voici Monseigneur Slon,
- vicaire général de l'Archidiocèse.
- Enchantée.
Moi de même.
Pardon du dérangement
mais il s'agit
d'une affaire importante.
J'ai une séance.
Ravie de vous avoir rencontré.
Désirez-vous un thé, ou...
- Non merci. Asseyons-nous.
- Bien sûr.
Comment va le Cardinal ?
Il est ennuyé
et c'est ce qui m'amène.
Il a reçu une lettre hier
d'un détenu d'Oswald.
Un certain Timothy Kirk.
Monseigneur,
il faut que vous sachiez
- qu'il s'est passé beaucoup entre nous.
- Il le semble.
Il prétend que vous l'avez
agressé sexuellement.
- Quoi ?
- Nous vivons des temps risqués,
et bien que Kirk
ne soit pas très crédible,
L'église ne peut se permettre
ni spirituellement, ni financièrement
qu'aucun autre prêtre
ne soit accusé.
- Il ment.
- Je vous crois,
et le cardinal aussi,
mais si Kirk
vous accuse publiquement,
nous devons être prêts.
Durant l'enquête,
je vous suspends donc
de vos fonctions.
Nous mènerons cette enquête
aussi rapidement que possible,
mais dès maintenant
vous n'avez plus le droit d'exercer
aucune de vos fonctions
de prêtre catholique.
Je suis désolé.
Le mal à l'état pur.
LA SAlNTE BlBLE
J'ai beaucoup aimé le spectacle
que vous avez monté,
et j'espère que
vous recommencerez.
Merci.
En fait, j'aimerais faire
beaucoup plus avec les détenus
que chanter et danser,
je pensais à Shakespeare...
- "Macbeth".
- Super.
- Oui.
- Mais coûteux.
Pas nécessairement.
On le ferait
en costumes modernes
avec peu de décors,
ainsi la pièce
serait à la portée de tous.
- Pouvez-vous préparer un budget ?
- Justement...
en voici un.
Je veux que les choses
avancent vite.
J'aimerais commencer la semaine
prochaine par des auditions
et la formation d'une équipe.
Le plus difficile sera de faire
participer ces têtes sans cervelles.
C'est pourquoi nous
avons la chance
de vous avoir
pour les motiver.
Pas besoin d'être
Denzel Washington.
L'idée est de vous donner
l'occasion de canaliser vos émotions
autrement qu'en bagarres
ou dans la drogue,
et tout le monde ne sera pas
sur les planches.
Suzanne a aussi
besoin d'un régisseur,
d'un éclairagiste,
d'un décorateur, tout le tralala.
Alors je compte
sur vous tous.
Engagez-vous.
- Et toi, Chucky ?
- Le théâtre, c'est pour les pédales.
Miguel, Miguel.
Allez, tout le monde pourra
voir que tu as changé.
Non, je serais gêné
devant tout le monde.
Alors sois régisseur.
- Ça fout quoi ?
- Ça commande tout le monde.
Vraiment ? D'accord.
OK, bien.
Eh, accessoiriste,
ça te dirait ?
"C'est le pouce d'un pilote,
qui a fait naufrage en rentrant
dans son pays".
- C'est très bien.
- Qu'est-ce que je baragouine ?
Tu racontes à tes amis
comment tu as détruit ton ennemi.
- Vraiment ?
- Ouais.
Génial.
Dans la pièce,
j'aurai un vrai pouce ?
T'as quelqu'un en vue ?
- Peut-être toi, couille molle.
- Répète, tache de sperme ?
- Quoi ?
- Calmez-vous, bordel !
- Ça va, M'man ?
- Si je peux les empêcher de s'étriper.
J'ai tous mes acteurs,
sauf pour Macbeth,
- alors, dis-moi...
- Désolé.
- Tu serais génial.
- Je t'aime, mais pas question.
- T'as pas de couilles, Blanc ?
- Et toi alors.
- Trouduc.
- Allez, ça pourrait être amusant.
Je l'ai joué à la maison
de quartier une fois.
Voyons. "Demeurez...
vous oracles imparfaits,
dites m'en davantage.
Par la mort de Sinel,
je suis thane de Glamis.
Mais comment de Cawdor ?
Le thane de Cawdor vit,
gentilhomme prospère,
et quant à être roi,
cela n'est pas plus dans
la perspective de ma croyance.
Dites, de qui vous tenez
cet étrange renseignement ?
Parlez, je vous l'ordonne" !
C'était excellent,
mon Père !
Aimeriez-vous
jouer Macbeth ?
- Moi ?
- Ouais.
Extinction des feux.
Bonne nuit, les petits.
- Amen.
- Enfin.
Le pouvoir de la prière
est une chose merveilleuse.
Etant gamin,
Je demandais à Dieu
d'empêcher mon père
de nous battre.
Il n'a jamais répondu
à mon appel.
Prier c'est pas juste
demander quelque chose.
Ça te recentre, ça te donne
une tranquillité d'esprit.
Prie avec moi.
Non, entre vous, la sœur Pete
et Tante Brenda, j'suis couvert.
Cela me réjouirait
profondément
si un jour
tu priais avec moi.
Ça me réjouirait de baiser
une pucelle de 18 ans,
- alors vous fatiguez pas.
- Vilain.
Souviens-toi
qu'il s'agit de pouvoir.
Tu ne peux pas
laisser ces gens
t'enlever ton pouvoir.
Souviens toi, Cyril,
tu es le centre
de l'univers.
Qu'est-ce que
tu putain de regardes ?
- Vous êtes le nouvel avocat ?
- Arnold Zelman.
Pourquoi mon frère est encore
dans le couloir de la mort ?
Il y a huit mois,
la cour suprême
a décidé qu'exécuter un arriéré mental
était inconstitutionnel.
Chaque état a le droit à sa propre
définition de la notion d'arriéré.
Nos législateurs ont passé tout
ce temps a essayer de la déterminer.
- Hier ils sont tombés d'accord.
- Et alors ?
Pour être considéré
arriéré mental,
il faut en avoir
montré des signes
- avant l'âge de 18 ans.
- 18 ?
Cyril a été frappé à la tête
après 20 ans.
Et il peut toujours être exécuté.
Putain.
Bon, on fait quoi, alors ?
On fait appel.
Au premier procès,
l'accusation a pu prouver
- que Cyril avait prémédité l'attaque.
- Mais c'était faux.
Nous devrons
le prouver en appel.
Je vais commencer par
réinterroger tous les témoins.
Super.
Ces connards d'Em City
n'ont aucune raison de m'aider.
Il nous en faut juste un.
Détenu numéro 99S917,
Glen Shupe,
jugé le 22 avril 1999
pour homicide involontaire.
Condamné à 15 ans de prison,
dont huit fermes.
Eh, tu veux
un coup de main ?
- T'approche pas de moi !
- Sois pas si grincheux.
Je suis comme ça
par ta faute !
Pas du tout.
Les hispanos t'ont découpé.
D'après toi.
Allo, Maman.
Que j'ais quelque chose
à voir ou non...
dans ton... quoi ?
Ton handicap,
sache qu'un avocat
va venir ici
pour enquêter sur le jour
où Li Chen s'est fait buter,
et si tu veux
garder l'autre main,
dis-lui ce qu'il
veut entendre.
Pigé, connard ?
Je suis venu parler du jour
où Cyril O'Reily a attaqué Li Chen.
Je sais que
vous avez parlé
avec plusieurs
officiers de police,
procureurs et avocats
de la défense,
et que vous avez témoigné
ne rien avoir vu,
et ne rien savoir
des circonstances de la mort de Li.
Mais comme j'ai repris
cette affaire tout récemment,
j'espère que vous pouvez...
Je sais exactement
ce qui s'est passé.
Ah bon ?
Ryan et Li se sont battus.
Un couteau est tombé par terre...
probablement celui de Li.
Et Cyril l'a poignardé
spontanément
pour sauver
la vie de son frère.
Ses actes n'avaient
rien de prémédité.
Avez-vous parlé
de ces événements
avec quelqu'un d'autre
récemment ?
Je veux dire,
quelqu'un vous a préparé ?
Non, monsieur.
C'est ce que j'ai vu et je veux
en témoigner au tribunal.
Faux témoignage,
c'est cinq ans de plus.
J'en fais déjà 15.
J'ai pas peur.
Comment progressent
les interrogatoires ?
Pour l'instant,
pas très bien.
- Et Shupe ?
- Il n'est pas très crédible.
C'est un menteur invétéré.
Le comble est
que cette fois il dit la vérité.
- Profitez-en.
- S'il vient à la barre,
Les jurés ne le croiront pas.
Pas un bon atout.
Alors vous trouverez
un témoin crédible.
Je l'espère.
Plus que quelques types.
- Alors quoi d'autre ?
- On fait du bruit.
La presse et le public
ont suivi cette affaire.
J'ai des contacts à la télé...
Eh, t'es sorti
du service psychiatrique ?
Tu t'es débarrassé
de tes démons intérieurs ?
J'ai appris quelque chose
de source sûre hier.
Ah ouais ?
C'est quoi ?
T'as fait manger du verre pilé
à mon père,
ça lui a taillé les tripes.
T'est responsable
de sa mort.
C'est la vérité...
sauf pour un petit détail.
C'était Adebisi le coupable.
Pas moi.
J'étais l'ami de ton père.
C'est qui, ta source sûre ?
Un barjot de l'asile de fous ?
Si je te le dis,
il est mort.
Très bien.
Et si c'était vrai ?
Ce qui n'est pas le cas.
Qu'est-ce
qu'une pute comme toi
peut y faire
de toute façon ?
Allez, tire-toi.
Tu pues les anchois.
Je dois avouer
être stupéfaite.
Des mois à essayer de vous
faire rencontrer votre épouse,
et tout à coup,
c'est d'accord.
Et bien, je me sens mieux
dans ma peau
grâce à vous
et au père Meehan...
J'ai longuement parlé
avec Rosalie hier.
Elle sait pas
ce qui m'est arrivé ?
Non, vous trouverez
le bon moment pour le lui dire.
"Le tambour, le tambour !
Macbeth arrive.
Les sœurs fatidiques,
la main dans la main,
messagères
de terre et de mer,
ainsi vont en rond.
Trois tours pour toi
et trois tours pour moi,
et trois de plus
pour faire neuf.
Paix !
Le charme est
dans le cercle" !
"Je n'ai jamais vu un jour
si sombre et si beau".
"A quelle distance
sommes-nous de Forres" ?
Bon, la ferme !
C'est l'heure.
J'ai à peine dit un mot.
"Demain et le jour après,
et le jours après".
Voilà un autre volontaire :
M. Peter Schibetta.
- Super. Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Tu pourrais aider
Ryan à peindre.
Pas besoin d'aide,
surtout la sienne.
J'ai vu cette pièce à l'école.
Elle est pleine d'incantations, non ?
- Oui.
- Nous les siciliens, on a
notre propre version.
Notre formule magique : le mauvais œil.
La grand-mère de ma femme peut
le jeter à quelqu'un à distance.
Je dis pas que ça marche,
mais qui sait ?
Je croyais t'avoir
dit de te barrer.
Pas de problème.
Pas de problème.
Ryan,
écoute, je sais que t'as fait
des choses dont t'es pas fier,
mais parfois
le fait d'en parler...
Allez droit au but,
mon Père.
Bien. Peter Schibetta.
J'ai vu l'hostilité avec laquelle
vous vous regardez.
Schibetta est une enflure.
Bon sang, arrête donc
de rouler les mécaniques,
arrête ces...
ces conneries,
un instant.
Je sais que tu penses
qu'il faut être dur pour survivre ici,
mais il y a
d'autres moyens.
Je t'ai vu
avec ton frère.
Il y a de l'amour,
de l'affection,
il y a du bon en toi.
Laisse donc
cette bonté sortir
et sois l'homme que Dieu
a voulu que tu sois.
- Comment, mon Père ?
- Je vais t'aider.
En commençant
par ton linge.
Tu devrais bien savoir
que si tu ne tries
pas ton linge,
Les couleurs
vont déteindre.
Dans la tribu Shona,
en Afrique,
Les vivants communiquent
avec Mwari...
c'est Dieu... à travers
leurs ancêtres morts, les Vadzimu.
Les Shona croient que
les vivants sont entourés
d'une communauté
invisible de Vadzimu
qui surveillent et s'occupent
de leurs descendants.
Mais il y a aussi Ngozi...
Les mauvais esprits,
les trompés,
Les négligés,
les assassinés...
qui se vengent
sur une famille
par une mort soudaine.
Bon Dieu.
Mon Père !
Mon Dieu, mon Père !
Mon Père,
qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Mon Père !
Mon Père ! Merde !
Au secours !
Au secours !
Au secours !
Ici, au secours !
Au secours !
Amenez le défibrillateur !
Quatre, cinq...
un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.
Le plateau d'intubation.
- Comment va t-il ?
- Le père Meehan est mort.
Putain.
Un anévrisme. Il est mort
presque instantanément.
- C'est arrivé comment ?
- Qui sait ?
Une autopsie en déterminera
peut-être la cause, mais...
Mais il sera toujours mort,
pas vrai ?
Pourtant, de toutes les morts
qu'il aurait pu connaître ici,
Dieu a choisi
la plus paisible.
C'est ça ! Quand je l'ai
trouvé par terre,
il a avait chié
dans son froc.
Ça dit quoi
sur les humains ?
La dernière chose qu'on
fait avant de mourir, c'est chier ?
Ayez donc du respect
pour cet homme.
J'en ai !
Vous savez, à la messe,
y'a deux semaines,
il a lu le passage
de l'Evangile
où après l'avoir
descendu de la croix
Les amis de Jésus
ont lavé son corps.
J'aimerais faire ça.
J'aimerais laver le corps
du Père Meehan.
Je sais pas.
Je vous en prie.
Il voulait prier avec moi,
mais j'ai jamais voulu.
Il voulait tant faire
pour moi et Cyril,
je luis dois bien ça.
...comme nous pardonnons
à ceux qui nous ont offensés...
Tu vas t'abîmer
les yeux avec ça.
Ce sont des livres de droit.
Le meilleur est écrit
en tout petit.
- Tu prépares une déclaration d'appel ?
- Ouais.
Par pour moi,
pour Chris Keller.
Pour tenter d'annuler
sa condamnation à mort.
Mon père travaille
aussi là-dessus.
T'es avocat ?
J'étais.
Le courrier !
T'as quelque chose
pour moi ?
Des magazines.
Et mon Playboy ?
Il s'est fait un peu
malmener au triage.
Salut, Beecher.
Tu te plais ici ?
Plus qu'avec
ces débiles d'Aryens.
Allez ! Arrêtez. Arrêtez !
T'espérais quoi ? T'as envoyé
Schillinger en isolement.
Pour t'avoir violé.
Je t'ai dit que je peux
m'occuper de moi. J'ai un plan.
Quel plan ?
Bonne visite
avec tes gosses.
Comment tu sais
qu'ils viennent ?
Winthrop !
Par six voix contre une,
nous avons dédié
de te sortir d'isolement,
sachant que si tu fais
une autre tentative de viol,
tu y retourneras
pour toujours.
Laissez-moi deviner.
Ma sœur, c'est vous
qui avez voté contre ?
Emmenez-le
dans l'Unité "B".
C'était bien, ma pute.
Je... je peux parler,
monsieur ?
Ouais, ben essuie-toi
d'abord la bouche.
Je suis 100% Aryen.
J'ai de l'éducation.
Je peux t'être
plus utile que ça.
- Tu veux entrer dans la confrérie ?
- Oui.
Ce serait pas commun.
D'habitude une pute
reste une pute.
- J'ai un plan.
- T'as utilisé ta cervelle de génie ?
Si on touche à Beecher
avant son évaluation,
tu vas en isolement
à vie, c'est ça ?
Ouais.
Pourtant tu ne penses qu'à te venger
de cette pourriture, non ?
- Où veux-tu en venir ?
- je vais tuer son père.
- Quoi ?
- Je vais brouiller les pistes...
J'assumerai
toute responsabilité.
Je peux le tuer.
Je le ferai si tu me promets
un avancement.
C'est bon.
Mon fils Harry
va venir aujourd'hui.
Je l'ai pas vu
depuis six ans.
Six ans ?
Ouais. Après la mort
de ma femme, mes parents
ont pris les deux aînés.
Ses parents
ont pris le cadet, Harry,
avec eux à San Diego.
Pourquoi tu l'as pas vu
tout ce temps ?
On a pensé
que c'était mieux.
Foutaise.
Un enfant doit
voir son père,
même si celui-ci
est en prison.
- Bonjour, mon fils.
- Papa.
- Où sont les gosses ?
- Faut que je te parle.
J'vais faire la sieste.
Réveille-moi pour le tarot.
Les parents de Genevieve
ont passé la semaine chez nous.
C'était gênant d'abord,
mais Jonah et Margaret ont fait
de gros efforts pour être...
à nouveau une famille,
pour réintroduire
Harry dans ta vie.
- Et ?
- lls attendent sur le parking.
Harry ne veut pas
descendre de voiture.
Il a six ans, mon fils.
Il a très peur.
Ses pleurs
bouleversent Holly.
- Ne le force pas.
- On essaiera encore demain.
Non, non, tu sais...
Attendons, OK ?
Je passe devant
la commission jeudi.
Si j'ai la liberté conditionnelle,
je le verrai chez moi.
Tu es sûr ?
Oui, je peux attendre.
- C'est juste quelques jours de plus.
- C'est vrai !
Cette fois
la commission de contrôle
va te laisser sortir.
Je le sais !
J'ai la ferme conviction
que tu vas être libéré.
Alors... il a l'air
de quoi, mon fils ?
Oh, et bien...
il ressemble à son père.
Il a les yeux de sa mère.
Alors tu vas voir Chris
pour parler de l'appel ?
Oui.
Transmets-lui mon amour.
Concentrons-nous
sur la crédibilité
du témoin
de l'accusation, euh...
Jerry Heekin.
Nous venons d'apprendre
qu'il avait été arrêté deux fois
pour trafic de cocaïne.
Pourquoi mon autre enculé
d'avocat ne le savait pas ?
Comme disent les gosses,
il était nul.
Faut vous calmer,
M. Beecher.
- Chewing-gum ?
- Non, merci.
- Vous ne m'aimez pas, hein ?
- C'est pas la question.
Pas besoin de vous apprécier
pour vous défendre.
- Et mon fils...
- M'aime.
Ça vous embête ?
Oui.
Qu'il aime un homme,
ou moi ?
C'est tout pour aujourd'hui.
Votre Honneur, veuillez ordonner
au témoin de répondre.
Bien.
Je vous trouve abject.
Content ?
Juste une entaille
de plus à mon pistolet.
Le procès du maire
a continué aujourd'hui
au tribunal de Bankhead.
Loewen a été inculpé
pour complicité dan le meurtre
de deux afro-américaines
de 10 ans en 1963.
D'après le procureur, Loewen,
qui était shérif
de Jackson à l'époque,
aurait aidé et soutenu
des membres du Ku Klux Klan
Iors de ces meurtres brutaux.
Pardonnez-moi.
Garde !
Garde ! Garde !
Garde !
Non !
Non !
En direct de l'est
de la ville.
Pillages et incendies durent
depuis plusieurs heures,
déclanchés par la déclaration officieuse
du gouverneur James Devlin
selon laquelle il gracierait
Wilson Loewen
s'il était déclaré coupable.
Tout d'abord,
laissez-moi vous dire
que nous avons
alerté la garde nationale,
bien que j'espère sincèrement
qu'elle n'aura pas à intervenir.
- La violence...
- Il nous faut garder le contrôle !
- Bloquez la prison ! Des questions ?
- ...n'a jamais rien résolu.
La raison de
cette émeute est encore
plus incompréhensible
que l'émeute elle-même.
Je suis innocent,
et pourtant vous détruisez
vos magasins, vos voitures,
vos quartiers
d'après des rumeurs
concernant un verdict qui non
seulement n'a pas été rendu,
mais qui en fin de compte
m'acquittera.
Bouclez tout !
Mes frères et sœurs,
nous devons arrêter
la violence dans la rue.
Les émeutes, le pillage,
la destruction
font plus de mal à notre communauté
que Loewen lui-même.
Il n'y a pas de victoire
Iorsque l'on répond
à la violence par la violence.
Regagnons notre ville...
Demeure en paix.
La Sainte Bible
Mein Kampf
Demandez à n'importe quel écolier
combien nous avons de sens
et il vous dira
probablement cinq.
Cinq ? Vous plaisantez ?
Et mon sens de l'équilibre,
du droit, du fair-play ?
Cinq c'est déjà presque trop
pour nos petites cervelles.
On a parfois tellement de sens
qui nous encombrent,
tellement de façons
de ressentir quelque chose,
qu'on pète les plombs.
Et ça mène à quoi ?
De la violence stupide.
Ouais, de la violence stupide...
De toutes sortes.
Depuis deux jours maintenant
les émeutes ébranlent l'est de la ville,
ceci après que le Gouverneur avait déclaré
qu'il gracierait le maire Loewen
s'il était condamné
pour son implication en 1963
dans le meurtre
de deux petites afro-américaines.
Suite aux émeutes,
écoles et bureaux
sont actuellement fermés.
La sécurité est renforcée dans
tous les établissements pénitentiaires.
Un verdict sera rendu
dans la semaine.
Garde, garde !
Non !
On a tué ton père
à coups de pic à glace...
un dans le dos
et plusieurs dans le ventre.
Qui ? Qui a tué mon père ?
Nous enquêtons. On recherche indices
et arme du crime dans les cellules.
La vache, c'est dégueulasse.
Je-je veux aller
aux funérailles.
Je suis désolé.
Nous ne pouvons l'autoriser.
La prison est bloquée.
Mais je passe devant
la commission de contrôle demain
et j'ai de bonnes chances
d'être libéré, de toute façon.
Ton audience a été repoussée
à cause des émeutes.
Devinez ce qu'on a trouvé.
Mais pourquoi ? Pourquoi
Clarence Seroy tuerait-il mon père ?
Je ne le connais pas.
C'est insensé.
On est à Oz.
Rien n'a de sens.
C'est peut-être les émeutes.
Y'a beaucoup
de tensions raciales.
Non, ce serait plutôt les Aryens
qui l'auraient engagé
ou qui auraient planqué le pic à glace
dans sa cellule pour faire diversion.
Ce putain de Schillinger
est derrière ça.
Tuer le père de Beecher,
la vache, le flash.
Rien de tel pour
pomper l'adrénaline.
Ces putains de gardes-chiourmes
n'ont pas la moindre idée d'un coupable.
Salut, Clarence !
Ça va ?
La vache, fait chier.
- Il ne trouveront jamais le coupable...
- Ferme-la, putain !
Le jury a déclaré le maire
Wilson Loewen coupable
de meurtre
sans préméditation.
Putain !
Je crois en l'innocence
du maire Loewen
et ce procès a été
un travesti de la justice.
Toutefois, étant donné
l'instabilité actuelle,
je ne le gracierai pas.
Pas tout de suite.
Laissons les choses
se calmer quelques mois,
et ensuite on le sortira de là.
Pourquoi l'envoyer ici ?
Mettez le dans une prison douillette
de moyenne sécurité
comme Hecht
ou MacArthur.
Ça ne calmera pas la mafia.
Ils veulent qu'il souffre.
Le plus important
c'est qu'il soit en sécurité.
Où sera t-il le plus en sécurité
dans ce charnier ?
Unité J... on y met
surtout des flics pourris
pour éviter des représailles
des autres détenus.
Qui est là-bas actuellement ?
Alvin Yood,
Tobias Beecher.
Aucun des deux n'est noir ?
- Non.
- D'accord.
Ecoutez-moi bien.
Wilson Loewen est mon ami.
S'il lui arrive
quoi que ce soit...
je réduirai cet établissement
en poussière.
- M. le Maire.
- Bonjour, Leo.
La dernière fois
où l'on s'est vus,
c'était à Morrisville.
Vous faisiez campagne
pour lieutenant gouverneur.
On avait récolté
un paquet de pognon.
J'étais déçu quand
vous vous êtes retiré de la course.
J'ai toujours pensé que
vous feriez un bon politicien.
Ecoutez, quelles qu'aient été
nos relations dans le passé,
c'est fini. Vous êtes
mon prisonnier maintenant.
C'est aussi simple
que ça, hein ?
Ou bien vous croyez
que j'ai tué ces fillettes ?
Vous avez été jugé coupable.
En tant qu'homme noir
vous savez
que c'est du bidon.
Conduisez Sa Majesté
au Unité J.
Merci, mon ami.
Les rues ont retrouvé
leur calme,
bien que l'on estime
que les dégâts
dus aux émeutes s'élèvent
à 13,7 millions de dollars.
L'état d'alerte est terminé !
C'est pas trop tôt.
Ils l'ont mis où,
Wilson Loewen ?
Je sais pas.
Probablement Unité J.
J ? Merde !
- Putain, laissez-moi sortir !
- La ferme, Cutler ! J'arrive.
Beecher est au J.
Il va s'attaquer au maire
pour se venger de moi.
Fais passer l'info.
Je veux que Beecher sache
qu'il ne vaudrait mieux pas
toucher à un cheveu du vieux.
Nous étions dans le Bureau ovale
et le président m'a dit :
"Wilson, sans vous,
je ne serais pas ici".
Et il m'a donné ça.
Ils portent le sceau présidentiel.
M. le maire,
vous êtes le seul
à avoir plus
d'appétit que moi.
De l'appétit... ouais,
pour le pouvoir.
Il paraît que vous
n'allez pas démissionner.
Le conseil va devoir
vous renvoyer ?
Et bien, l'honorable
James Michael Curley
a servi les bons gens
de Boston depuis la prison.
Il a même été réélu en taule.
Je pourrais faire pareil.
On m'adore.
- Je vais peut-être tenter gouverneur.
- Pourquoi pas Dieu ?
Bordel de merde ?!
Bon Dieu.
Ça va,
vous pouvez parler ?
Ouais, ça va.
Je me suis
juste... étouffé...
Il lui a fait la manœuvre
de Heimlich.
Il a... quoi ?
Beecher a sauvé
la vie de Loewen.
Que me veut Schillinger ?
Il vaut mieux qu'il
vous le dise lui-même.
J'en ai assez de
ses mensonges.
C'est probablement un piège
pour saboter mon passage
devant la commission.
J'avoue qu'il m'a trompée
tout comme vous dans le passé, mais...
cette fois, c'est différent.
Beecher ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Loewen a toujours été là
pour ma famille...
pour moi.
Quand mon père
trouvait pas de boulot,
il l'a embauché
aux espaces verts.
Pour notre lune de miel
Martha et moi,
il nous a donné
des billets d'avion.
C'est mon héros.
Tu lui as sauvé la vie.
Je te suis redevable.
Alors sache que je n'essaierai pas
d'empêcher ta liberté conditionnelle.
Si tu peux sortir
de ce trou de merde...
vas-y.
Foutaise.
Je te crois pas.
- Toi, reconnaissant ?
- C'est vrai.
Vrai ?
J'peux t'en citer
des choses que
tu disais vraies.
- Je suis obligé de rester ?
- Non.
Si tu l'as pas fait
pour me calmer,
pourquoi t'as
sauvé Loewen ?
Parce que j'ai vu un homme
en train de mourir...
et mon instinct a été
de lui sauver la vie,
mon instinct
le plus profond.
Après toutes ces années à Oz,
je l'ai toujours.
C'est quelque chose
que tu ignores totalement.
Par suite des événements récents :
la mort de votre père,
votre secours
à un autre détenu,
ainsi que votre conduite
exemplaire constante,
La commission a décidé de vous
accorder la liberté conditionnelle.
Vous êtes un homme libre,
M. Beecher.
Ce sera effectif
dans quelques jours
mais techniquement parlant
vous êtes libre.
- Merci.
- Bonne chance.
Pincez-moi, ma Sœur.
Je rêve encore.
Non, Tobias,
vous ne rêvez pas.
- Oh mon Dieu.
- Putain de bon Dieu !
Oh mon Dieu !
Oh mon Dieu !
Eh, Lopresti. Mon avocat devrait
être là depuis une heure.
Pouvez appeler pour savoir
ce qui se passe ?
- T'es pas au courant ?
- De quoi ?
Y'a une bonne nouvelle
et une mauvaise.
La mauvaise c'est que
le père de Beecher est mort.
Non.
Le premier jour de blocus,
assassiné dans le couloir.
Ça complique
un peu ton appel.
Et la bonne nouvelle ?
Ta copine se casse.
C'est vrai,
Beecher rentre chez lui,
et d'après ce qu'on dit,
il est tellement pressé de partir
qu'il n'aura pas le temps
de passer dire au revoir.
Shirley Bellinger, mise à mort
à Oz par pendaison.
Vous savez
ce qu'on dit ?
Quand l'un
de vos sens défaillit,
Les autres compensent
en devenant plus forts.
Si vous devenez aveugle,
tout à coup
votre ouïe s'améliore.
Vous perdez l'odorat ?
Vos papilles gustatives s'emballent.
Alors, que se passe t-il
si vous les perdez tous,
si plus rien
n'a de sens ?
Vous devez vous reposer
sur les autres pour survivre
et à Oz, ça pourrait
être dangereux.
Debout, bande d'enfoirés !
Debout !
J'peux pas.
J'suis malade.
Foutaise.
Si tu envisages
de faire la sieste à l'hôpital
parce que White l'a fait,
tu vas être déçu.
Bouge ton cul !
Nom de Dieu !
Y'a un problème ici.
Putain, c'est quoi ça, l'Ebola ?
Va te faire foutre, Martinez.
Ouais ouais,
blablabla toi-même.
Va te faire enculer !
Faut vous calmer,
M. Martinez,
sinon je vous attache.
C'est le chouchou
de l'infirmière ?
Nathan ne veut pas
me donner plus de calmants.
T'as qu'à appeler
l'ordre des médecins.
Que se passe t-il ?
Empoisonnement dû au chlorure de
méthylène. Penders, White et Martinez.
- On les a empoisonnés ?
- Pas "on", nous.
- Quoi ?
- Oz elle-même.
On trouve du chlorure
de méthylène dans aérosols,
décapants, nettoyants
pour métaux, polyuréthane
tout ce qui a été utilisé
pour restaurer cet endroit.
- Et où les résidus se sont-ils déposés ?
- En isolement.
Merde.
Quel est le pronostic ?
Troubles respiratoires et gastriques
soignables s'ils sont pris à temps,
mais ces types, ils n'ont respiré
que ça 24 heures sur 24.
Martinez a le foie bousillé.
Penders et White
les poumons abîmés,
sans parler des effets
neurophysiologiques.
Ils vont devenir fous ?
Ou peut-être l'inverse.
Martinez a besoin
de soins spécialisés.
J'aimerais l'envoyer
à Mission Memorial.
Non.
Il sera mieux soigné.
Gardons ça chez nous,
pour l'instant.
Il n'est pas encore
nécessaire de faire savoir
qu'Oz est toxique.
Alors je veux
faire une déclaration.
Vous êtes
un bon médecin.
Vous avez sauvé Pancamo
d'un staphylocoque.
Nous ne l'avons pas publié !
J'ai confiance que vous allez
aussi sauver ces types.
- Pouvez pas frapper ?
- Désolé.
J'pensais pas que
ce soit nécessaire.
Je dois remmener
Martinez en isolement.
Il ne va pas y retourner...
- C'est écrit là.
- Je m'en fous.
Sauf avis contraire
de Glynn,
- Martinez s'en va.
- Je reviens.
Pardon.
Alors...
qu'est-ce que t'as, hein ?
Tu vas mourir ?
J'adore quand
tu deviens muet.
Mais j'veux pas que tu meures.
Pas sans me dire
qui t'a payé
pour me couper le tendon.
Et tu vas me le dire,
car j'ai des amis en isolement.
Quand tu vas
y retourner, ils vont...
Le directeur au téléphone,
dans mon bureau, sur la trois.
Buenas noches, mi amigo.
Vous faites une belle paire,
vous deux !
Marteau-piqueur,
façon Miss Sally.
Sur le côté,
sur le côté, et trois.
Encore, et do si do,
et quatre, et cinq,
sur le côté,
et deux, et trois...
C'est le meilleur
épisode de tous.
Sautez, faites travailler
ces jambes...
Agent Murphy,
j'ai quelque chose à demander.
J'suis pas
d'humeur tendre.
J'veux changer de travail.
J'suis à la mécanique depuis le début.
- J'ai besoin de changer.
- Pour aller où ?
Je pensais à l'hôpital.
J'ai des copains
qui y travaillent.
J'pourrais peut-être
y faire du bien.
Pour toi-même,
tu veux dire.
Tu me prends
pour un idiot ?
Ton pote Martinez
y est pour quelque chose
qu'il a attrapé en isolement.
Carlos est à l'hôpital ?
Je savais pas.
L'une de mes priorités
est de vous garder
aussi éloignés que possible,
jusqu'à ce que Martinez admette que
tu lui as ordonné d'attaquer Brass.
Encore ce vieux refrain ?
Quand il le fera,
tu seras foutu.
Dans la merde jusqu'au cou.
Bien, j'vais demander
à McManus.
- C'est ça.
- Exactement.
- Ouais. Salut.
- Ouais. Salut.
Et si Martinez me vend ?
Il l'a pas fait jusqu'à maintenant.
Il le fera jamais.
Maintenant et jamais,
c'est pas la même chose.
L'isolement peut
user un homme,
et si Carlos est malade
et que les gardes-chiourmes
Iui refusent ses médicaments
jusqu'à ce qu'il parle...
Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire ?
Le tuer.
Non, il est des nôtres.
Ouais, mais pour
combien de temps ?
Extinction des feux !
Souvent, quand une femme
tombe enceinte,
son odorat change
pour le pire.
Soudain les roses
sont pourries,
et le pain frais, mince,
on dirait de l'ammoniaque.
Les épileptiques ont
quelque chose de similaire.
Souvent ils peuvent dire
quand la crise arrive
car ils commencent à sentir
des choses invisibles,
alors au moins
ils peuvent s'asseoir
avant que
la crise ne commence.
En matière de grossesse
et d'épilepsie,
on a bon sens
des problèmes qui arrivent.
Dommage qu'on n'ait pas
celui pour les éviter.
Je viens travailler.
Bonjour. Vous me donnez
un coup de main ?
J'aimerais que vous fassiez
la distribution aujourd'hui.
- William Blake.
- Exact.
- C'est la couverture de...
- "Chants d'expérience".
J'aurais jamais pensé
trouver un fan de Blake ici.
Pardon, mais il fut que je vous
le demande : Pourquoi êtes-vous ici ?
Pourquoi travailler à Oz plutôt
qu'à une bibliothèque municipale
où vous trouveriez
des fans de Blake ?
Et bien... un jour,
il y a un an environ,
je prenais une douche chez moi
quand j'ai entendu un bruit.
Je sors de
la salle de bain,
et il y a ce gosse
dans le couloir,
avec mon lecteur de DVD.
Et je suis là,
en habit d'Eve,
et bien que je pense que
mon corps soit un plaisir des yeux,
Le gosse panique
et saute par la fenêtre.
Il se tord la cheville,
puis la police l'arrête.
Apparemment il avait aussi volé
d'autres personnes.
Alors je suis allée témoigner
à une séance avant le procès,
et le gosse était là,
Germaine...
si petit, si mignon...
assis à côté de sa mère.
Et je pense
"Il va aller en prison".
Puis je pense "Bon Dieu,
il peut l'avoir mon lecteur de DVD".
Vous auriez pu
retirer votre plainte.
Je l'ai fait,
mais les autres non.
Je suis allée voir Germaine
au centre de détention juvénile
et je lui ai parlé de l'école.
- Vous savez ce qu'il m'a dit ?
- Il ne savait pas lire.
Ça m'a brisé le cœur.
Je suis allée
à Plymouth House
chaque semaine
et le lui ai appris,
et il se jetait sur les mots
comme une plante sur la pluie.
Il avait l'esprit tellement malin,
si vivant, si assoiffé.
C'est merveilleux.
Il s'est fait poignarder
et il est mort.
Je savais
qu'il y en avait
d'autres comme lui
à Plymouth,
mais je n'ai pas pu
y retourner.
Je savais aussi que
je ne pouvais pas arrêter là.
Alors... me voilà !
Au milieu de vieux livres
et de mauvaises attitudes.
La vérité, Robert,
c'est que chaque livre ici
est nouveau
pour qui ne l'a pas lu.
Vous savez, Blake a dit
"Il y a en chaque jour un moment
que Satan ne peut trouver".
C'est vrai.
Vous savez
quel est mon ultime but ?
Faire durer ce moment
toute une vie.
Libros.
Libros para los muertos.
Eh, tu me files un roman.
- Lequel ?
- Je sais pas.
Un long.
J'ai plus de PQ.
Eh, je te recommande
quelque chose ?
T'as des livres en relief ?
- Non.
- Alors non merci.
Lire me désoriente.
Agamemnon.
La réponse est non.
Allons !
- Norma est venue trois fois de suite.
- Alors dites-lui d'arrêter.
Rien à dire à celle
qui m'a planté devant l'autel
et se radine
deux mois plus tard
avec l'enfant d'un autre.
Tu ne veux pas
de ses nouvelles ?
- Et de l'enfant ?
- Je suppose qu'ils vont bien.
Suppose à ta guise.
Pourquoi, ça va pas ?
Arrêtez de me pomper.
- Norma va bien ?
- Demande le-lui toi même.
Norma est encore venue
aujourd'hui ?
On est tous
les deux en prison ?
- Pardon ?
- Je suis désolé.
Je croyais qu'on
posait des questions
dont on connaissait
déjà les réponses.
Je crois que
tu devrais la voir.
J'en ai parlé avec Stella et...
Qu'a Stella à voir là dedans ?
C'est une femme
très intelligente.
Elle m'a rappelé
un passage de Blake :
"Certains naissent
dans la douce joie,
d'autres dans
d'infinies ténèbres...
Je vois, je vois.
Tu es doux, je suis infini.
Non, c'est pas du tout ça.
Ce que Blake dit
c'est que tu renais chaque jour
et tu as le choix.
Tu vois ? C'est pour ça
que j'aime les livres en relief.
Il y a une maladie
qui s'appelle synesthésie.
Elle vous fait associer
les lettres avec des couleurs
Les sons avec le toucher.
Imaginez lire un livre
et être constamment inondé
dans une cascade
de vert et de violet,
ou entendre un accord
à la guitare
et le sentir dans le cou
comme les lèvres de votre amant.
Pourquoi on appelle ça
une maladie, mystère.
Ça me semble plutôt
être une grâce,
et ça prouve que
même la plus simple réalité
est totalement différente
pour chacun de nous.
Bélial, ramène les esprits
de ceux qui sont partis,
ces âmes sombres
et troublées qui ont passé
Leurs dernières heures
au couloir de la mort.
Arrête ta merde,
espèce d'ordure !
Louanges à l'enfer.
Louanges à Satan.
Faut que vous fassiez
arrêter Kirk.
Il me rend
putain de dingue.
Croyez-moi,
c'est ce qui m'amène.
Je savais bien
qu'on se reverrait.
Tu as écrit
une lettre au cardinal,
m'accusant de t'avoir
agressé sexuellement.
Vous m'avez touché le pénis.
Vous m'avez sucé l'oreille.
C'est un mensonge.
Je dois voir l'Archidiocèse
et les flics cette semaine.
J'vais leur donner
tous les détails juteux.
En mentant,
tu ternis
les plaintes légitimes
d'hommes et de garçons
agressés par le clergé,
et tu fais mal
aux nombreux prêtres
qui mènent des vies
chastes et spirituelles.
D'après Nostradamus,
l'Eglise romane est prête à s'écrouler.
Je veux que
tu dises la vérité.
Laissez le-moi ! J'vais la faire
sortir de son petit cou la vérité.
Vous savez très bien
que c'est pas la solution.
Il va mourir de toute façon.
Peu importe comment !
Tu m'as demandé
de t'exorciser
et te libérer
de l'emprise du démon.
J'en suis incapable,
mais j'ai contacté
un expert qui est prêtre...
Trop tard, comme toujours...
trop tard.
Quand je serai exécuté,
votre ministère
vous sera retiré,
vous serez abandonné
par l'Eglise
et vous passerez
le reste de vos jours
errant, sans but
et sans espoir.
Dans la mort...
je serai triomphant.
Une présentation
de mode ?
Oui.
- Avec des condamnés à mort ?
- Oui.
- Dans le magazine "Maxim" ?
- Oui.
Et pourquoi pensez-vous
que ce soit une bonne idée ?
L'attaché de presse du gouverneur
pense que ça donnera
un aspect positif
au système pénitentiaire.
Ça paraît... je sais pas,
immoral.
Ou un dernier tour de piste
pour les condamnés à mort.
Voilà comment
ça va se passer :
Chacun de vous, les Bozos,
sera pris en photo individuellement
dans différents vêtements,
et ensuite en groupe.
Des questions ?
- Ouais, le magazine sort quand ?
- Janvier.
Ah, bien,
je pourrai le voir.
- Mon exécution n'est qu'en avril.
- Super.
OK, c'est bien.
Un petit sourire.
OK, bien.
C'est bien.
Salut, les filles.
- OK, grand sourire.
- Jericho sait sourire.
C'est bien.
Faut que
je change le tube.
OK, super.
Finissons-en.
OK, prêts pour
la photo de groupe.
Mettez-vous derrière lui.
Et vous derrière.
Et vous aussi derrière lui.
Toi et moi, sur pellicule
pour la postérité.
Super, les gars.
C'est bien.
Prenez un air de gros durs.
- Putain !
- Merde !
Cette fois, tu meurs,
enculé !
J'ai eu un appel
du vicaire général.
Puisque Kirk est mort,
Monseigneur Slon
a convaincu la police
de laisser tomber
l'enquête sur moi.
- Vous êtes de retour.
- Oui.
Mes prières
ont été entendues.
Pete...
j'ai prié pour
la mort de Kirk.
Je viens de finir de lire
les mémoires d'Augustus.
C'est remarquable,
n'est-ce pas ?
Sa façon de décrire les gens,
comment tout fonctionne...
C'est l'un des meilleurs livres
sur la vie carcérale.
Tout à fait d'accord.
- Ouais, que fait-on avec ?
- Et bien...
J'ai pris
la liberté d'envoyer
Le manuscrit
à mon éditeur.
Il veut le publier.
C'est fantastique.
Tu l'as dit à Redding ?
J'ai essayé.
Il n'avait pas l'air
de m'entendre.
Putain.
Il recommence
à tourner en rond.
Eh, mon pote, t'en as encore
pour longtemps ?
On essaie
de jouer au ballon.
Non seulement
il s'occupe pas des affaires,
mais il est devenu sourd.
J'te le dis, mon pote,
ce vieil enculé est foutu.
Il nous faut du sang jeune
pour diriger la tribu.
Toi, mon pote.
J'suis pas un numéro un.
J'ai déjà essayé
et j'suis pas de taille.
Alors qui ?
Tant qu'on aura
pas trouvé, mon frère,
on est coincés
avec le vieux Burr.
Oh, oui !
Oui...
Dans ces temps difficiles,
il est essentiel
que le gouvernement
travaille main dans la main
avec l'industrie pour créer
de nouvelles opportunités économiques.
Aujourd'hui,
je suis heureux d'annoncer
que des entreprises privées
seront établies
à l'intérieur de nos prisons,
employant des prisonniers
à temps complet
sur la base du mérite.
Les premiers programmes
seront mis en place
à la prison d'Oswald et au centre
de détention féminine Parker.
Merde.
Said.
J'ai réfléchi
à ce que tu as dit,
que j'étais un chef
qui ne dirigeait pas vraiment.
J'ai pas arrêté de penser
à toute la merde que j'ai causé.
J'ai causé
la mort d'Augustus.
J'ai des jeunes
qui trafiquent la came.
Je peux pas
continuer comme ça,
et eux non plus.
Très heureux de l'entendre.
J'ai une idée,
mais il faut que
je parle à McManus.
Mais je suis plus
tellement crédible.
Tu veux que
j'y aille pour toi ?
Je veux que
tu viennes avec moi.
Ta présence me permettra
de me faire entendre.
D'accord.
Mais c'est quoi ton idée ?
Pour faire arrêter mes gars
de vendre de la came,
faut leur offrir
une alternative.
De vrais emplois.
La jeune femme au bout de la table
s'appelle Donna Degenhart.
Elle est propriétaire de cette nouvelle
entreprise à Oz. Donna ?
D'avance, merci à tous
de m'aider
à créer ma société.
- C'est quoi exactement ?
- Du télémarketing.
Des détenus
démarcheront par téléphone
et contrôleront des banques de
données pour d'autres entreprises.
Comme qui ?
Sociétés de télécommunications,
sondeurs d'opinion publique,
œuvres de charité,
réservations aériennes..
Si vous faites ça, que devient
Kentwell Communications ?
- Pardon ?
- La société de télémarketing en place.
Nous n'allons mettre
personne en faillite.
Le marché peut supporter
deux sociétés.
Et vous le savez grâce
à votre vaste expérience ?
Non, parce que
36 autres Etats
ont mis en place
de tels programmes
et les retombées positives à l'intérieur
compensent largement
- tous problèmes minimes à l'extérieur.
- Oh... vraiment.
J'ai l'impression d'entendre ça
à chaque fois qu'on commence un truc.
Et combien de fois ça
nous est bénéfique ?
Bon sang, t'as des actions
chez Kentwell Communications ?
Non, un frère.
On veut être impliqués
dans cette nouvelle entreprise.
Alors remplissez
une fiche de candidature.
On pensait
à quelque chose
- d'un peu plus proactif.
- Proactif ?
Tu l'as préparé ?
Je sais de quoi vous me soupçonnez
à l'intérieur de ces murs,
et si vous croyez
en vos soupçons,
vous devez l'admettre,
je suis bon en affaires.
- Vous seriez tous deux contremaîtres ?
- Exactement.
J'ai pas vraiment d'argent
dans mon budget
pour deux emplois.
Ceci m'amène
à ma question :
Vos employés
son payés au SMlC ?
Non, non, loin de là.
Alors ils gagnent une misère.
Sauf dû respect,
ce sont les gens honnêtes
qui méritent
un salaire honnête.
De plus, c'est plus que
les 2,50 dollars par semaine
que tu gagnes actuellement.
C'est comme dire
à un esclave
d'être heureux de pouvoir
travailler en famille.
Allons, elle essaie juste
de lancer son affaire.
- Aux dépens de qui ?
- Je ne veux exploiter personne.
Parfois ça vient naturellement.
Malheureusement, l'essence
même des affaires est que
c'est toujours juste
des affaires.
J'ai pris une décision.
Les musulmans...
ne prendront pas part.
Veuillez m'excuser.
Je n'ai qu'une chose à dire :
Je l'emmerde.
Je travaillerai pour rien
jusqu'à ce que
vous fassiez un bénef.
- Mon contremaître.
- Oui.
"Et pour moi
la vie c'est, c'est vivre,
avoir des sentiments
et essayer de ne pas tomber
dans les endroits durs en soi,
créés par les endroits
durs autour de soi.
C'est une chanson
sur le ton des conneries
qui t'emmerdaient,
entre les rêves, c'est une situation
qui ne signifie rien.
Alors moi,
je force mon esprit
à se concentrer sur le rêve,
parce que tout le reste est gris
quand je dors pas,
et l'important dans la vie
c'est là où tu vas te rendre".
Augustus, mon pote,
ce poème est pour toi.
La réunion ne s'est
pas bien passée.
Comment tu le sais ?
Tes yeux sont
pleins de rage
Mon cœur est empli
de déception.
Pourquoi toutes les bonnes choses
viennent toujours avec une mauvaise ?
"Si la foi était facile,
tout le monde croirait".
- Ce sont tes propres mots.
- Ouais.
Il doit bien
y avoir un moyen.
Pour faire affaire sans rouler
tous les travailleurs.
- L'économie n'est pas mon fort.
- Ouais.
Où vas-tu ?
Réfléchir.
Juste réfléchir.
J'aimerais bien comprendre
ce que Redding mijote.
Il paraît qu'il
quitte la cuisine,
qu'il va être contremaître
pour l'entreprise de télémarketing.
Il n'arrêtera pas
forcément de trafiquer.
Il nous faut
des informations.
Joins-toi à nous.
Tu veux que
je m'assoie avec vous ?
T'as fait la paix
avec Guerra.
Vous n'allez pas vous poignarder
avec vos fourchettes.
Et puis j'ai une question.
22 cm, baby.
- T'es copain avec les nègres ?
- Non.
- Poet, peut-être un peu.
- Ouais.
Il sait qu'on a été
en guerre.
Je veux que tu lui parles.
Vois quels sont vraiment
les projets de Redding.
Espionner.
Ben, ouais.
J'ai plus faim.
Fais-le, Miguel.
Tu pourras revenir
à El Norte.
Tu sais, je...
J'suis content d'être
en paix avec Chico,
mais ça s'arrête là.
Je passe devant la commission
de contrôle dans trois ans.
En attendant, je vais être
putain de Gandhi.
Tu veux mon dessert ?
Miguelito...
t'as bonne mine.
Ouais, et tu fais
vraiment jeune.
Pourquoi tu viens me voir
après tout ce temps ?
- T'es mon fils, non ?
- Et alors ?
Ça n'avait pas
d'importance avant.
Si t'étais pas toujours
en isolement ou au trou,
ou à t'évader
sans venir me voir...
Quand veux-tu que je vienne ?
T'es juste venue pour foutre
davantage la merde dans ma vie ?
Merci.
Fais le gros dur si tu veux
mais si t'es si dur,
imagine combien l'est
La pute qui t'a mis
au monde.
T'es une dure à cuire.
Ouais.
Tu m'emmerdes.
OK, j'suis content
que tu sois venue.
Tu sais, quand je me suis évadé,
je suis pas venu te voir
parce que j'ai pensé que les flics
viendraient m'y chercher.
Tu avais raison.
Comment va Maritza ?
Super bien.
Elle couche
avec quelqu'un ?
Elle est agent de voyage.
Elle envoie les gens en Europe,
au Japon, en Australie...
Je t'ai posé une question.
Je lui parle une fois,
peut-être deux fois par mois.
Je crois pas.
Dis-lui de venir me voir.
Ce serait mieux
si c'était toi.
J'vais pas le lui demander.
J'vais pas la supplier.
Elle n'a qu'à venir.
Merde.
Eh, c'est Maritza.
Je suis absente.
Laissez un message.
Eh... Ritz.
Je pense souvent
à toi en ce moment.
Maman m'a dit
que tu te débrouillais bien,
à envoyer des gens
partout dans le monde.
J'espère que t'oublies pas
que je fais toujours
partie de ton monde,
parce que, baby,
t'es la plus grande partie du mien.
Je sais que
j'ai pas été le meilleur...
tu sais...
en quoi que ce soit,
ces dernières années,
mais si...
tu pouvais utiliser
un peu de cette magie
d'agent de voyage
pour te procurer une voiture,
aller à Oz,
merde...
tu ne le regretterais pas...
je te le promets.
Bien.
Je t'aime.
Et tu me manques.
Ouais, vraiment.
Viens, je t'en prie.
Ouais, je t'en prie.
Disons qu'un jeune
dévalise quelqu'un,
une fille vole
des sacs à main à l'étalage,
une jeune mère
noie sa fille.
Tout ce qui leur manque
tous c'est du bon sens.
Ils ont perdu leur faculté de penser
correctement en cours de route.
Regardez Oz.
Le bon sens crée
le criminel moyen.
Le désire de bien faire
est probablement le sens
le moins commun de tous.
Mon Père. Mon Père.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
- Au secours ! Au secours !
- Amenez le défibrillateur !
- Le Père Meehan est mort.
- Oh, putain.
Eh, O'Reily.
Il paraît que ton pote
le père Meehan a cassé sa pipe.
Tu dois être déchiré.
- Ouais, c'était un homme bon.
- Ouais.
Maintenant t'as une idée
de comment c'était
- quand t'as tué mon père.
- Ta gueule, salope.
OK. Je me demandais juste comment
tu te sentiras quand Cyril mourra.
On va faire appel.
Et ta mère.
Quoi ?
Ta mère.
Si tu t'approches
de ma mère,
je t'étripe vivant.
Pas besoin. J'ai l'œil du mal,
tu te souviens ?
Ouais, c'est ça.
C'est ce qui a tué
Meehan, tu sais ?
Un sort de la grand-mère
de ma femme et ce fut rapide.
Tu sais, tu devrais vraiment
être en psychiatrie.
T'es putain de dingue.
Meehan m'a donné
son chapelet.
C'est tout ce qu'il faut...
un truc de la personne.
J'ai donné le chapelet
à ma femme
qui l'a donné à sa mémé...
arrivederci, Meehan.
Je vais jeter un sort
sur tous ceux que tu aimes,
et quand tu pourras plus
supporter la peine
je le jetterai sur toi,
et je sourirai quand
tu te tordras dans ta merde.
Putain de rital,
espèce d'enculé !
- Putain...
- Doucement.
C'est bon, c'est juste
un passage à vide.
- Ouais.
- Ouais.
Allez, on se calme.
Eh, t'as une minute ?
Pour toi, j'ai juste
28 secondes,
mais vu comme tu parles
à double sens, ça devrait suffire.
Peter Schibetta. Il dit partout
qu'il peut jeter un sort.
L'œil du mal, bien sûr.
La grand-mère
de sa femme l'aurait.
Il lui manque une case.
La vache,
ça me rassure,
parce que non seulement
il dit m'avoir jeté un sort,
mais il dit
en avoir jeté un sur toi.
Ouais,
c'est ce qu'il a dit.
Je crois qu'il t'en veut encore
de s'être fait enculer... deux fois.
Putain de petit connard.
Tu devrais peut-être
parler à Peter, hein ?
- Ouais, je devrais peut-être.
- Ouais.
Quand vous dites "Chevillez
votre courage au point résistant",
ce que vous dites c'est
"Ayez des couilles.
Ne laissez pas tomber".
"Mais chevillez votre courage
au point résistant
- et nous n'échouerons pas".
- Bien.
- Puis j'explique le projet de meurtre.
- Oui.
Bon, c'est tout.
On recommence
demain à 15h00.
Bien, merci beaucoup.
A plus tard.
Je dois dire
que je m'éclate.
Je dois aller
voir ma femme,
j'ai hâte de lui
parler de vous.
Merci. A plus tard.
Eh, t'as des nouvelles
de l'avocat
pour la date
de l'appel pour Cyril.
Tout ce que Zelman a dit
c'est dans la semaine.
- Merde.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je trouve pas
mes clés de voiture.
- Quoi ?
- J'étais sûre de les avoir laissées là.
Je parie que
Schibetta les a.
Il va te jeter un sort.
J'y vais.
Non, faut que j'y aille.
- Doucement.
- Y'a une urgence.
- Quelle urgence ?
- Difficile à expliquer. Allez...
- T'iras nulle part.
- Putain.
Eh, Petey, baba !
Les gars,
ça fait longtemps.
- Où tu vas ?
- Voir ma femme.
- On a annulé.
- Pourquoi ?
- Faut qu'on parle.
- De quoi ?
La vie et la mort.
Ma vie, ta mort.
Non !
Monsieur le directeur,
venez voir.
Je suis pas vraiment
désolé qu'il soit mort.
C'est quoi ?
Son œil.
Blocus ! Blocus !
Merde,
qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
O'Riley, attrape.
Le voilà,
ce petit connard.
Tu m'as planté
et j'ai failli mourir.
- Tu vas le regretter.
- Garde ! Garde ! Garde !
Espèce de sale pute !
Dehors, allez !
Bordel de merde.
Ouais.
- J'ai besoin de ton aide.
- Dégage.
Après tout ce que j'ai fait pour
la confrérie, tu m'es redevable.
Eh, tu l'as entendu,
dégage.
Ferme ta gueule, pute.
J'suis plus une pute, mon pote,
et quant à ma gueule,
c'est toi qui as les gencives
d'un nègre. Ciao.
Tu sais ce qu'est
le vrai ennui ?
C'est quand
tu veux te faire jouir
et qu'en même temps
tu veux pas.
Ecoute, les ritals
sont après moi.
J'ai besoin de ta protection.
En échange,
je volerai, je planterai...
tout ce que tu veux. Aide moi.
Mon cul est en danger.
Si c'est ce que tu veux,
mais j'ai peur que ton cul
ne soit pas
en sécurité... pute.
- J'suis pas une pute.
- Alors ciao, baby.
Si tu veux rester en vie,
viens sortir papa
de son ennui.
Je n'ai personne d'autre
à qui parler ici.
Je suis là pour ça.
Vous avez déjà eu
peur de mourir ?
Oh, ouais.
Ma première année ici,
un homme du nom
de Warren Sticks,
nous étions au milieu
d'une séance
et soudain il a bondi
de sa chaise
et m'a serré la gorge.
Je me suis évanouie
et quand je suis revenue à moi
j'étais au milieu
d'une marre de sang,
son sang.
Il s'était taillé les poignets
avec le côté coupant de mon
distributeur à ruban adhésif.
J'ai réalisé qu'il...
essayait de m'assommer
pour pouvoir se tuer.
Vous vous souvenez
de cette sensation,
penser que
vous alliez mourir ?
C'est ce que
vous ressentez maintenant ?
Je l'ai ressenti chaque jour
depuis toujours.
Ça remonte à quand ?
Bien plus loin
que je n'aimerais.
J'étais l'enfant unique
de Gerald Robson.
Même en étant gosse,
on fait ce qu'il faut
pour survivre,
parce que à six ans,
s'enfuir n'est pas une option.
- Il vous battait ?
- Oh, ouais.
Et pire encore.
Il vous a agressé
sexuellement ?
C'est drôle,
me voilà à 36 ans,
et j'ai nulle part
où m'enfuir.
Et ce que...
je veux savoir c'est :
Est-ce OK de faire
tout ce qui est nécessaire...
pour survivre ?
- Est-ce OK ?
- Ou bien devrais-je mourir ?
- Non, non, mais...
- C'est ce que je pensais.
Merci, ma Sœur.
Parfois la pire des choses,
- la pire des putains...
- ... putain d'état
est que tous vos sens
travaillent à fond.
Comment cela
peut-il être mal ?
Il y a certaines choses
que nous faisons...
en étant vus, touchés, entends,
sentis et goûtés tout à la fois...
qui vous font regretter
de ne pas être morts.
Lèche ça.
C'est ça, suce-la bien.
Maintenant rends la-moi.
Baisse ton pantalon.
Penche-toi en avant.
Quoi ?
Toi et moi,
on va jouer de la cuillère.
Et maintenant
penche-toi, bordel.
La Sainte Bible
Mon Combat
Mort poignardé
pendant l'émeute à Oz
Le pouvoir de la musique.
Que ce soit un concerto,
une ballade ou un rap,
La musique nous stimule.
Ouais, elle nous stimule.
Willy Shakespeare a dit : "Si la musique
nourrit l'amour, continue de jouer".
Hé !
Vous êtes censés vous dire adieu.
Utilisez vos lèvres pour parler.
- Enfoiré.
- Vous avez une minute, les filles.
- Hé, enfoiré.
- Allez, Chris.
Laisse tomber.
J'ai beaucoup de choses
à dire avant de partir.
Je vais te dire,
j'ai du mal
à admettre que tu sois vraiment
relâché sous surveillance.
Crois-moi, je ne le comprendrai pas
vraiment non plus
jusqu'à ce que je sois
en train de siroter un martini.
Toby, je suis...
Je suis...
Quoi ?
Je suis ravi.
Tu vas enfin pouvoir
passer du temps avec tes gamins.
Arrête.
- Qu'est-ce que tu essaies de me dire ?
- Ne m'oublie pas.
Jamais.
Maintenant que je vais sortir,
je vais redoubler d'efforts
pour annuler ta condamnation à mort.
On va se voir plus qu'avant.
Mais quand même.
Si je meurs, ne m'oublie pas.
Tu ne vas pas mourir.
Quand tu le dis, j'ai presque
l'impression que c'est vrai.
C'est vrai.
Il est l'heure.
Il est l'heure !
Enfoiré.
Chris, arrête !
Connard !
T'as quelque chose pour moi ?
Non.
J'adore ma Rosie.
Merci.
M. Le Maire ?
Vernie, je me demandais
quand tu allais te montrer.
Je suis très content
de vous voir, monsieur.
Il est pour moi, ce courrier ?
Oh, oui.
Vous êtes bien installé ?
Vous avez tout ce qu'il vous faut ?
Oui.
Vous m'avez fait une belle frousse,
quand on m'a dit que vous étiez
presque mort d'étouffement.
Quand est-ce que le médecin
va vous relâcher ?
Je reviens au quartier J demain.
Bon dieu.
- Monsieur ?
- Encore une lettre de haine.
Un nègre qui dit
que je suis sorti trop facilement.
Il dit qu'il a un cousin ici
à Oswald
qui va me pulvériser.
- Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
- Vous tuer.
Connard de black.
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
votre honneur,
je ne les laisserai pas faire ça.
Ah oui ?
D'après ce qu'on dit, les Aryens
à Oswald sont assez lamentables.
Ce type qui m'a sauvé
de l'étouffement, Beecher.
On m'a dit que tu essaies
de le descendre depuis six ans,
et la seule preuve que tu as c'est cette
petite cicatrice au-dessus de ton œil.
J'ai fait descendre son fils
et son père.
Tu es demeuré ou quoi ?
Dire des trucs pareils aussi fort ?
Tu sais, Vernie, je dois te dire
que je ne t'ai jamais considéré
comme une lumière.
Tu as toujours eu
cet énorme confiance en toi
sans avoir quoi ce soit
pour la justifier.
Tu as toujours eu des plans ambitieux
sans les couilles pour les réaliser.
Merde ! S'il n'y avait
pas eu ton père
je ne t'aurais
même pas regardé.
Tu es la honte de la fratrie.
Tu vas voir si j'ai des couilles.
Parle plus fort, mon garçon,
je ne t'entends pas.
Rien, monsieur.
Comment s'est passé
ta rencontre avec le maire ?
Qu'il aille se faire foutre.
Enchanté de t'avoir connu.
Moi aussi, Yood.
Moi aussi, Yood ?
Tu es d'une telle bonne humeur
que je ne suis pas sûr
de vouloir t'accabler
avec les infos
que je viens d'apprendre.
Je sais qui a tué ton père.
Qui ?
Franklin Winthrop.
Sur ordre de Vern Schillinger.
Je le savais.
Merde.
J'ai pensé que
tu voudrais savoir maintenant,
au cas où tu veuilles faire
quelque chose avant de partir.
Quoi, par exemple ?
Schillinger a assassiné ton père.
Wilson Loewen est comme
un père pour Schillinger.
œil pour œil,
dent pour dent.
Alors j'ai dit : "Ronnie,
dis à Nancy de garder sa culotte".
- Et il l'a fait ?
- Non, dès qu'il s'agit de cette femme
rien ne peut le convaincre.
Ce fut un plaisir, M. Le Maire,
mais j'ai une réunion à Lardner.
Oui, je dois y aller aussi.
Jimmy, tu pourrais rester
encore deux minutes ?
Oui.
On se voit bientôt.
J'espère, chérie.
Sale pédé.
Tu m'as juré que je n'aurais pas
à faire un seul jour de tôle.
Wilson, ils avaient mis
le feu à la ville.
Pardon, ils avaient mis
le feu à leur ville,
Leur quartier, leurs magasins.
Il y a eu escalade de la violence,
elle se répandait...
Et alors, tu envoies la garde nationale,
les gaz, les balles en caoutchouc.
Tu ne trahis pas
un ami de toujours.
Tu n'humilies pas cet homme,
surtout quand celui-ci sait
où les corps sont enterrés.
Je veux mon amnistie, Jimmy,
et je la veux aujourd'hui.
Je ne passerai pas une nuit de plus
dans ce tas de merde, compris ?
Si ça doit causer
un orage politique, je m'en fous.
Si tu ne me donnes pas
mon amnistie,
je ferai une conférence de presse
et je raconterai quelques histoires.
Des histoires de corruption,
de pots de vin, de fraude électorale.
Quand j'en aurai fini,
tu seras assis tout près de moi
au Unité J en train
de jouer aux dames.
D'accord.
Je vais me débrouiller.
Tu te débrouilles toujours, Jimmy.
C'est pour ça que je compte sur toi.
Perry.
Je voudrais
que tu fasses quelque chose.
Quelque chose qui demande
une énorme discrétion.
Nous y voilà.
Oui.
Je ne vous dis pas adieu
parce qu'on se reverra.
Les collègues du cabinet d'avocat
de mon père ont décidé
en sa mémoire de faire du volontariat
auprès des prisonniers.
Bien que j'aie été
rayé du barreau,
- je vais coordonner le bureau.
- C'est super.
Je suis ravi, Tobias.
Je suis ravi que quelque chose de bon
sorte de toute ce que tu as dû souffrir.
Je veux vous remercier tous les deux
pour avoir toujours été là pour moi.
Merci beaucoup.
Merci.
On se voit demain.
Tobias, ne reviens pas demain.
Prends du temps pour être
en famille, avec tes enfants.
Et réconforter ma mère.
Beecher, je te promets
que je découvrirai
qui a tué ton père.
Ouais, c'est ça.
Beecher, signe ici.
Tu es libre.
Tu peux y aller.
Je peux y aller.
Libre.
Libre.
Fais attention à toi.
"Ce qui est bien avec la musique, c'est
que quand elle frappe, on n'a pas mal.
Alors frappe-moi
avec la musique".

Wilson Loewen est mort.
Ah... bon.
Ah... bon.
Ah... bon.
C'est étonnant les livres
que peuvent lire les prisonniers.
Franchement, Henry James ?
À la fac, il a fallu qu'on me le fasse
avaler pour que je le lise, James.
Oui, c'est étrange que
Pablo Rosa veuille emprunter
"Les Ambassadeurs".
Il a 18 ans,
il est ici pour avoir assassiné
un camarade de classe.
C'est bien de savoir qu'il veut élargir
son champ de vision.
Regarde au dos du livre.
C'est du sang ?
Il a assommé son camarade
de cellule avec.
Pablo Rosa, hein ?
Il est dans quel bloc ?
Pourquoi ?
Je sais que
tu veux aider les gens,
mais tu ne peux pas
toucher un gamin pareil.
C'est précisément pour cela
que je devrais essayer.
Ton petit copain ne s'inquiète pas
de te voir venir ici tous les jours ?
C'est ta manière de me demander si
je suis avec quelqu'un ? Pas très subtil.
Oui.
Eh bien, Robert,
pour moi...
Les hommes sont comme les livres.
Parfois je veux
une histoire romantique,
parfois un thriller,
parfois même un roman salace
à emmener avec moi sur la plage.
Et parfois...
J'ai envie d'un classique.
Mais quand j'en ai fini, je le remets
sur l'étagère et je passe au suivant.
Tu n'as jamais été mariée ?
Oh, non.
C'est peut-être que...
Tu lis trop vite.
Je suis vorace.
Prisonnier n°° 02R104 :
Pablo Rosa ;
condamné le 22 décembre 2002 ;
homicide involontaire ;
verdict : 18 ans ;
Iiberté conditionnelle dans 10 ans.
Pablo ?
Entrez.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
J'ai lu ton dossier.
Tu as 18 ans et il te reste
18 ans à faire, c'est ça ?
J'ai la liberté conditionnelle
dans 10 ans.
D'accord, bien...
Comment tu comptes passer
le temps en attendant ?
Aussi vite que possible.
Tu vois Pablo,
ce n'est pas une réponse.
Tout comme
ceci n'est pas une arme.
Si vous voulez mon avis,
c'était plutôt efficace.
Mais ce n'est pas fait pour ça.
Dis-moi, tu sais lire ?
- Bien sûr.
- Tu aimes ça ?
Non. Les livres c'est de la merde
que vous donnent les profs.
- Alors tu es allé à l'école ?
- Parfois.
Mais pas toujours, parce que tu
détestais ce que te donnaient les profs ?
Ouais.
Tout le monde ne peut pas
apprécier les mêmes choses.
J'aimerais qu'on trouve
un livre qui te convienne.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que quand on l'aura trouvé,
tu ne verras pas le temps passer,
et c'est ce que tu veux.
Dis-moi ce qui t'intéresse.
Quoi par exemple ?
Les chattes et le baseball ?
On est sur une piste.
Hé Rebadow, j'ai entendu dire
que tu étais à la bibliothèque
en train de reluquer
autre chose que des bouquins.
Je ne m'abaisserai pas
à te répondre.
Calme-toi, je suis juste
un peu jaloux, tu comprends ?
Ta gonzesse vient
te voir régulièrement, non ?
La mienne, je l'appelle mais elle
ne pèterais même pas dans ma direction.
Tu devrais échanger avec Busmalis.
Sa nana vient tout le temps,
mais il refuse de la voir.
Merde, préviens-moi
la prochaine fois qu'elle vient.
J'accepte les visites
avec tout ce qui a une jupe.
Norma est ici aujourd'hui.
Elle a demandé à me voir,
je ne sais pas pourquoi.
Fais-en profiter les copains.
Partage.
Merde !
Vous croyez que je peux
convaincre Busmalis de vous voir,
mais je ne peux pas.
Il est impénétrable.
Allons.
On le connaît, Agamemnon.
Le mur qu'il a autour
de son petit cœur tendre
n'est pas plus épais
que de deux centimètres.
Je ne suis pas cardiologue.
Je ne sais pas
comment pénétrer le mur.
Dites que vous m'avez vu,
que je pleurais.
- Vous ne pleurez pas.
- Ça m'arrive.
Tous les jours.
Dites-lui ceci :
Je viendrai une dernière fois.
S'il ne vient pas,
même pour me dire adieu,
alors je jure qu'il n'entendra plus
parler de Norma Clark.
D'accord.
Mais je ne vous promets rien.
S'il vous plaît, Bob !
Faites tout ce que vous pouvez.
Vous voyez ?
Je pleure.
Où tu étais passé ?
Tu sais que je déteste
jouer au solitaire tout seul.
Mets le quatre noir sur le cinq.
Voilà pourquoi.
Je viens de voir Norma.
Quoi, ma Norma ?
- Agamemnon, calme-toi.
- Elle a fait ça dans mon dos.
Il y a une raison pour que
tout le monde soit de son côté ?
Je crois que vous êtes
tous les deux du même côté.
Et toi, tu es qui ?
Le Dr Amour ?
Et toi, qu'est-ce qui te permet
d'établir un diagnostic aussi sûr ?
D'abord, tu l'appelles
"ma Norma".
Tu as encore
12 ans à faire à Oz.
Tu veux vraiment les passer
à être en colère et affligé ?
Qu'est-ce que tu en sais ?
Tu es occupé à te pâmer
devant ta bibliothécaire.
Oui.
Stella a provoqué toutes sortes
de sentiments en moi.
Elle m'a rappelé comment
j'étais quand j'étais jeune,
ma passion pour l'architecture,
ma passion pour Betty.
J'étais sur le point
d'avoir une carrière extraordinaire,
une vie extraordinaire.
Mais je suis seul depuis 38 ans.
Et je commence juste à rattraper
le temps perdu.
Toi, tu choisis de perdre le temps
que Norma et toi avez ensemble.
La reine rouge sur le roi.
Oui, je le vois.
Dis-moi minus, qu'est-ce que c'est
que ces conneries ?
Tu n'as pas aimé
"Servitude humaine" ?
J'ai cru que c'était
un manuel d'instruction.
Ça parlait d'un gamin estropié.
Il n'y avait même pas d'images.
Désolé.
Et "Macbeth" ?
L'histoire d'un cruel seigneur
de guerre écossais
qui tue sans pitié
pour acquérir le pouvoir.
Ils sont en train
de monter la pièce ici.
Oui, ça a l'air pas mal.
Tu attends quoi,
Lady Macbeth ?
Donne-le moi,
ce putain de livre.
N'oublie pas mon biscuit.
Salut, Robson.
C'est quelle teinte
de rouge à lèvres ?
Rouge suce-moi ?
On a entendu dire que tu travaillais
au département "entrées et sorties".
Va te faire foutre, Pancamo.
Je vais te dire
une chose, pute.
Cette foi-ci je vais te battre
avec ma main faible.
- Pour égaliser un peu.
- Salope.
Je discutais, c'est tout.
- Depuis quand c'est interdit ?
- Depuis tout de suite.
- "Depuis tout de suite".
- Qu'est-ce que tu viens de dire ?
Voilà le problème,
tu es incapable d'écouter.
Alors concentre-toi et fais un signe de
la tête pour dire oui ou non, d'accord ?
C'est un début.
Puisque Redding prévoit
de passer à la vente à distance,
je te rends la cuisine.
Maintiens son efficacité,
sa propreté,
et son honnêteté.
En échange de ma générosité,
je ne veux plus
que tu t'approches des Aryens.
D'accord ?
C'est là que tu dis "merci".
Merci.
De rien.
Vous leur avez donné quoi,
à ces connards de nazis ?
Et maintenant tu te la fermes.
Psst, White.
White !
Quoi, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Comment tu te sens ?
Mieux, heureusement.
Et toi ?
Bien, pas génial.
Ils t'ont dit ce qu'on avait ?
Non, ils répondent à moitié.
Moi aussi.
Ça ne doit pas être trop grave
si Nathan nous a renvoyés
de l'hôpital aussi vite.
Je voudrais du silence !
- Il revient quand, Martinez ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- lls vous ont dit ce qu'on avait ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Ah, vous voyez ?
Le silence.
On va donner
10 milligrammes à Gannon.
Carlos Martinez...
C'est un type affreux.
Son foie se détériore rapidement.
On va augmenter sa dose
d'Aldactone de 25 milligrammes.
Martinez, t'as vraiment
une sale tronche.
Brass te cause des ennuis ?
Comme toujours.
Écoute.
Morales a peur, il pense que tu vas dire
à Brass comment il a perdu sa cheville.
Je jure sur ma tête
que je ne le dirai jamais.
C'est ce que Morales pensait.
Il m'a chargé de te refroidir.
Je suis trop faible
pour me battre, Chico.
Merci, mon frère.
Sois fort.
C'est fini ?
Non.
J'ai parlé à Martinez.
Il ne te balancera pas.
Je t'ai dit de le tuer.
C'était un ordre.
C'est un camarade.
Tu veux le descendre ?
Fais-le toi-même.
C'est ce que je vais faire.
Et je n'oublierai pas ça.
- Grace !
- Il est mort.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
J'étais au bureau en train
de faire des rapports.
- Je ne l'ai pas entendu sonner.
- Comment tu as pu ne pas l'entendre ?
- J'étais très occupée.
- Plus maintenant, tu es virée.
Carlos Martinez est mort.
Merde.
Il est mort
parce que vous et moi,
on ne l'a pas mis dans un vrai hôpital
pour qu'il soit bien soigné.
- Maintenant, il est mort.
- Gloria.
Je dois faire une autopsie,
et cette fois-ci
je ne mentirai pas.
Je ne couvrirai rien.
Je dévoile tout.
Vous m'entendez ?
Je dévoile tout, bordel !
Merde.
Je ne suis pas sûre que
ce soit la meilleure solution.
Quand le conseil médical de l'état aura
examiné les conclusions de Nathan,
La vérité éclatera de toutes façons.
Mais est-ce que tu ne devrais pas
attendre les résultats de l'autopsie ?
Celui qui annonce la nouvelle
a de meilleures chances
de la contrôler.
Vive le dévoilement total.
Merci d'être venu.
Nous avons découvert que
des éléments chimiques toxiques
présents dans les conduites d'air
des cellules d'isolement
ont infecté trois prisonniers.
Malheureusement, cela a provoqué
hier la mort de l'un d'entre eux :
Carlos Martinez.
J'assume l'entière responsabilité
pour la mort de Martinez.
Bonjour, mes bien-aimés.
Je vous apporte
un bulletin d'infos :
Votre pote Martinez
est parti les pieds devant.
Les pieds devant ?
Il est mort, crétin.
- Il est mort de quoi ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Mais ce qu'il avait,
vous l'avez aussi, bande de nases.
- Vous êtes sûre ?
- C'est ce qu'on raconte.
Merde.
Si j'étais vous,
je reverrais mon assurance-vie.
Mais, attendez...
Quand on part on met toujours
les pieds devant, c'est normal ?
Pourquoi est-ce que
ça veut dire mourir ?
Tais-toi, Omar.
Non, écoute.
C'est pas logique du tout.
Partir les pieds en arrière, se casser
le pied, se brûler le pied, oui, mais...
La ferme, Omar !
- C'est pas logique du tout.
- Hé, Sean.
Je te cherchais.
Me voilà. Tu veux aller boire
une bière après le boulot ?
Oui, et c'est ma tournée. Pour fêter
la mort de ce sale latino de Martinez.
Je ne verserai pas une larme,
c'est clair.
Dommage qu'il ait calanché
avant d'avoir balancé Morales.
C'est ça qui est beau mon pote,
il l'avait déjà balancé.
J'allais régulièrement
rendre visite à Martinez,
j'essayais toujours
de lui tirer les vers du nez.
Il devait savoir
qu'il allait crever
et il devait vouloir partir en paix,
parce qu'hier soir il a tout craché.
- Une confession sur son lit de mort ?
- Oui.
Martinez l'a épinglé,
ce singe de Morales.
Tu le sais depuis hier soir
et tu ne le dis que maintenant ?
C'est pour ça
que je te cherchais.
Je veux Morales en isolement,
tout de suite.
D'accord, allons-y.
Enlevez les menottes.
Qu'est-ce que
vous voulez, bordel ?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Le spectacle de la mi-temps.
Hé, Penders.
Tu crois qu'ils vont lui mettre
les pieds devant, à Morales ?
Chut.
Martinez m'a coupé ici.
Il a ruiné mes chances de jouer
professionnel un jour.
Et puis, je boîte.
Tu vois Enrique,
si je coupe seulement celui-là,
tu boitera, toi aussi.
mais si je coupe les deux,
tu pourras marcher.
Je vois le diable.
Je vois le diable partout.
Et vous dites que tout cela
a commencé quand ?
Quand Kirk est mort.
C'est comme si ce qui
le hantait était entré en moi.
Je vais demander à Sœur Peter Marie
de vous donner un rendez-vous.
Je ne suis pas fou, mon père.
Je vois le diable...
Juste au-dessus de votre épaule.
Apparemment, il va tenter l'incapacité
mentale pour son pourvoi en appel.
Non, il n'arrête pas de dire :
"Je ne suis pas fou".
Personnellement je pense
qu'il est fou, mais lui ne le croit pas.
Je ne suis pas sûr
qu'il ait toujours été fou.
Donc, je ne suis pas sûr
qu'il doive être exécuté.
Vous pourriez parler à Hoyt ?
Bien sûr. Mais puis-je te demander
ce que tu espères
tirer de tout ça ?
- Personnellement ? Rien.
- Oui.
Attends une minute.
Tu essaies d'apaiser
ta conscience en aidant Hoyt ?
Tu m'as dit toi-même que tu avais prié
pour que Timmy Kirk meure.
Oui, mais je sais que Dieu
ne répond pas à ce genre de prières,
que Hoyt a agi
de son plein gré
et que je n'ai rien à voir
dans la disparition de Kirk.
Et pourtant au fond de toi
tu es content que ce garçon soit mort.
C'est bien ce que j'ai dit, tu essaies
de supprimer ton excès de culpabilité
en faisant du cas
de Hoyt une cause.
Veille à ce qu'il soit
un bon réceptacle.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez dire ?
Ce n'est pas Jaz Hoyt,
la victime.
Tu peux t'échapper,
mais je ne suis pas
comme le Révérend Cloutier.
Je ne disparaîtrai pas comme ça.
- Mme Kirk ?
- Oui.
Je suis le père Mukada.
J'ai les affaires de Timothy.
Il faut juste que vous signiez
ce formulaire.
Vous connaissiez mon fils ?
Euh, oui.
Un si doux visage.
Qui aurait pu savoir qu'il avait
tant de mal à l'intérieur ?
Il a laissé son propre bébé mourir
dans une benne à ordures.
Et puis il est venu ici.
Il a dit des choses
tellement horribles,
tellement choquantes...
À propos de l'Église, de Jésus.
Il m'a traitée de pute de Satan.
Mon père,
pourriez-vous me confesser ?
Qu'est-ce que vous pouvez bien
avoir à confesser ?
Je n'ai plus aimé mon fils
à partir de ce jour.
Mon cœur est devenu froid,
et j'ai arrêté de l'aimer.
J'ai besoin que Dieu
me pardonne pour ça.

Bonjour, Cyril.
Il y a quelque chose
dont j'aimerais te parler.
Je me demandais...
Attendez ma Sœur,
vous ne me dites pas bonjour ?
Bien sûr.
Bonjour, Jericho.
Cyril,
comment tu te sens
en ce moment ?
Il va bien.
C'est bon, c'est assez.
On va mettre Jericho
de côté, d'accord ?
Non.
Oui.
Donne-moi cette marionnette.
Va... te faire foutre...
Grosse... Salope.
Cyril,
je t'ai donné Jericho,
et maintenant,
j'aimerais le récupérer.
Lâche-le. Allez.
Aïe !
Gardien !
- J'ai besoin d'aide.
- Lâche-la !
Jericho m'a forcé à le faire !
Jericho m'a forcé à le faire !
Lâche-moi !
- Donne-moi ce truc !
- Prends-le !
Lève-toi.
Jericho.
Jericho.
Jericho !
Jericho ! Jericho.
O'Reily, ferme ta gueule.
Jericho.
Tu pleures comme une nana
pour une pauvre marionnette ?
Jericho.
Tu vas la fermer
tout de suite, sinon...
Jericho, Jericho.
Bon, je t'aurai averti.
- Matt !
- Jericho.
- Jericho.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe, bordel ?
Jericho.
Asperge-le,
ce petit con.
Arrête, arrête !
Arrête !
Tu en veux, toi aussi ?
Arrête !
Éteignez les lumières !
Si la cour d'appel ne fait rien,
Cyril O'Reily va mourir
le mois prochain.
Il sera le premier à être exécuté
selon le nouveau concept
de handicap mental
défini par l'Etat.
Il faut qu'on se prépare à un tollé.
Oui, Reimondo et son groupe
de joyeux drilles bien-pensants
ont déjà agité
la presse et le public.
La question qui se pose est :
comment est-ce qu'on riposte ?
Il n'y aurait pas tout ce grabuge
si les gens pensaient
que ce mongol était normal.
Alors il faut
qu'on le rende normal.
Ou qu'il apparaisse normal.
D'après les dossiers
de Sœur Peter Marie,
on a administré à Cyril toute une batterie
de médicaments pour le calmer,
et aucun n'a eu aucun effet.
C'est pourquoi je propose
d'utiliser la TEC.
Qu'est-ce que c'est, la TEC ?
C'est un euphémisme
pour dire thérapie par électrochoc.
M. Le Gouverneur...
On se méprend à propos de la TEC.
Ce n'est pas cette torture mentale
horrible qu'on voit dans les films.
C'est vraiment bénin.
Je ne vais pas discuter le pour et le
contre de la thérapie par électrochoc.
Cyril est le patient
de Sœur Peter Marie.
On ne peut pas prendre
de décision sans la consulter.
Le Dr Donald Rofe, Directeur du Bureau
d'État de Santé Mentale,
va la rencontrer demain.
Il faudra aussi la permission
de la famille O'Reily.
Signée par le père,
Seamus O'Reily.
Tu es d'accord avec tout ça ?
C'est moi qui ai eu idée.
Peter Marie, vous allez bien ?
Non.
Je viens d'avoir une réunion
avec Don Rofe.
Il m'a dit qu'ils allaient
faire une TEC à Cyril O'Reily.
Et...
Que je ferais bien
de me taire et d'apprécier.
Et vous allez le faire ?
Eh bien...
C'est ce que je suis
en train d'essayer de décider.
D'habitude, dans des situations
comme celle-ci,
je lève les remparts
et je charge.
Mais comme
Rofe l'a dit
avec tant d'éloquence,
dans le cas de Cyril...
J'ai complètement échoué.
Tout ce que
j'ai essayé a échoué.
Alors, je dois mettre
dans la balance ma fierté
et ce qui est préférable
pour mon patient.
Je ne veux pas dire non
juste pour empêcher quelqu'un
de réussir là où j'ai échoué.
Et vous croyez qu'un petit tour dans
le labyrinthe de McManus va marcher ?
Ça ne peut pas faire de mal.
Vous vouliez me voir ?
Oui, Ryan. Assieds-toi.
C'est bien, parce que je voulais
vous voir aussi.
Je viens de voir Cyril,
et il est terriblement triste.
Si sa marionnette est si importante
pour lui, pourquoi ne pas la lui donner ?
Je ne peux pas, Ryan.
C'était mon idée de lui
donner Jéricho, tu te souviens ?
C'était une manière pour Cyril
de supporter la confusion du procès.
Mais malheureusement,
la marionnette est devenue
plus que ça pour lui.
Elle est devenue
une autre personnalité à part entière.
Je me fous de ça.
Je veux juste que
Cyril soit heureux.
Ce n'est pas si simple.
Cyril souffre de dépression grave
et de schizophrénie.
Bon, alors quelle
est la prochaine étape ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire
pour le guérir ?
Ton père a déjà donné son accord
pour une thérapie par électrochocs.
Mon père ?
Qu'est-ce que ce vieux salaud
a à voir avec tout ça ?
Je sais, c'est incroyable,
mais au regard de la loi,
il est le gardien de Cyril.
Bon, alors cette thérapie
par électrochocs,
elle sert à quelque chose ?
Je n'en ai pas l'expérience.
Le traitement était à la mode pendant
des années, puis c'est devenu mal vu.
Cependant certains professionnels de
la santé mentale ne jurent que par ça.
Les preuves cliniques
indiquent que la TEC
produit une amélioration significative
de 80% chez les patients.
Est-ce que c'est dangereux ?
Il y a des maux de tête,
des courbatures,
des nausées et
des pertes de mémoire.
Écoutez...
Il s'agit de 1 20 volts,
une charge domestique courante
qu'on applique au cerveau
pendant la moitié d'un seconde.
10 à 15 fois pendant une période
de deux à trois semaines.
Personne ne sait
s'il y a des séquelles permanentes.
Non.
Bon dieu,
on ne peut pas les arrêter ?
Le problème c'est qu'ils ont comploté
pour que cela arrive.
On est écarté
des prises de décision.
J'ai parlé à Zelman pour voir
si on pouvait aller au tribunal
pour contester cela, et il m'a dit
qu'on ne gagnerait pas.
C'est du génie.
Devlin veut faire
des électrochocs à Cyril
et le rendre assez normal
pour pouvoir l'électrocuter.

c'est le cognac des damnés".

- Bonjour, Cyril.
- Tu veux bien monter ici ?
Crois-moi,
ça va être du gâteau.
On va te donner
deux médicaments différents,
L'un t'endort et l'autre
détend tes muscles.
- Ça va piquer un peu.
- Une fois que tu seras endormi,
ces électrodes vont mesurer
le courant qui stimule ton cerveau.
On va faire une petite procédure
aujourd'hui.
Ça va juste piquer un peu.
Détends-toi.
Détends-toi.
Ça va t'endormir.
- Ça fait mal ?
- Pas si tu es endormi.
Il est dans les vapes.
- Prêt ?
- Feu !
Comment tu te sens ?
J'ai un mal de tête affreux.
Tu l'as dit à tes médecins ?
Qui ?
Laisse tomber.
Parfois, si quelqu'un te prend
dans ses bras
La douleur s'en va.
Tu veux que je te prenne
dans mes bras ?
D'accord.
Viens, chéri.
- Bonjour Ryan.
- Bonjour.
Je viens juste...
de recevoir un coup de fil
d'Arnold Zelman.
Ils ont refusé l'appel de Cyril.
Merde.
D'accord.
D'accord, et maintenant
on fait quoi ?
Zelman va certainement essayer
de trouver une autre approche,
un autre appel,
mais en attendant le juge a fixé
La date d'exécution de Cyril.
Quoi ?
- Quand ?
- Dans trois semaines à partir de jeudi.
Ça ne laisse pas
beaucoup de temps.
J'ai la conviction profonde que
allons empêcher cette exécution
mais au cas où, Ryan,
- je crois qu'il faut que tu acceptes.
- Non.
Pas question.
Si j'y pense même un instant,
dès la seconde où je me laisserai croire
que mon frère va mourir,
alors il mourra.
C'est la bible du père Meehan.
Je ne sais pas.
J'ai la foi, ma Sœur.
Pour la première fois
depuis très longtemps,
j'ai la foi.
Je ne comprends toujours pas
pourquoi on a arrêté
de gérer la cafétéria.
On a trouvé de nouveaux boulots.
Il n'y a pas mieux que la cuisine.
Mon ventre le prouve.
Je nous ai trouvé mieux,
quelque chose qui nous mettra à l'écart
de la crasse et de la boue.
Ça va, on n'a pas de problèmes.
Tu te trompes, Kenaniah,
on est tellement dans le merde,
que tu la sens même plus.
- Alors c'est quoi, ton idée géniale ?
- On va faire de la vente à distance.
- De la vente à distance ?
- Je ne plaisante pas.
Je vais vous apprendre
des choses, les garçons.
Ça vous rapportera plus de liquide
que ce que vous gagnez en cuisine.
- Pas plus que le trafic de came.
- On ne trafique plus.
- T'es malade, négro ?
- Pas question de...
Attends, quelle est
ta perspective, Burr ?
Il n'a pas de perspective.
C'est l'aube d'un nouveau jour,
messieurs.
Notre mission est
de se lever et d'y faire face.
On va se tenir debout.
Et voici le centre névralgique
de notre opération.
C'est très bien.
Et ça marche comme toutes
les agences de vente à distance ?
Mieux. J'engage ces gars pour rien,
vous m'engagez pour très peu,
ce qui fait diminuer
vos coûts de fonctionnement,
augmente le volume d'appel
et remplit vos coffres de campagne.
Et au jour le jour,
pas de différence ?
On procède normalement. Vous nous
donnez les numéros et le texte,
et on se met au travail.
Et personne ne sait que ce sont
des prisonniers au bout du fil ?
Non, à moins que vous vouliez
qu'on leur dise.
Croyez-moi, ce serait la dernière chose
que le Sénateur Laken
- voudrait révéler à ses électeurs.
- Laken ?
Le salaud de droite,
l'affolé de la bible ?
Sa législation est la raison
pour laquelle la moitié des hommes ici
restent deux fois plus longtemps.
Je vous assure, M. D'Arta,
que mon entreprise
n'appartient à aucun parti,
et nous nous engagerons à faire
ce que vous voulez que nous fassions.
Pas de ligne éditoriale !
Je suis désolé, monsieur,
je n'ai pas voulu vous insulter.
Ce n'est pas grave.
Tout le monde a le droit
d'avoir ses opinions.
Nous sommes en Amérique,
après tout.
Et ce programme fonctionne
dans d'autres prisons ?
Il prospère.
Une situation comme celle-ci est
un bénéfice pour tous. Personne ne perd.
Je suis directeur de campagne,
Mlle Degenhart.
Il y a toujours un perdant.
Mais je communiquerai
votre proposition à mon équipe.
Super.
Me laisse pas débloquer, kéblo,
traque le mauvais négro.
Il magouille et il louche,
pas franc, il te regarde méchant.
Ce négro se frappe
la poitrine quand il tape,
il connaît trop la vérité, il voit
les vertus de la nuit, de la sérénité.
Rien ne l'attend demain.
Imagine ce qu'il tient dans sa main.
Dans son rêve il y a 500 ans de haine,
de la vapeur sous pression,
qui s'élève comme
le sommet du Kilimandjaro.
Alors attends demain,
que les choses soient de mon côté.
Je vais foudroyer le malsain,
en toute tranquillité.
Burr, quoi de neuf ?
Les affaires roulent, messieurs.
J'ai signé le contrat aujourd'hui.
Pourquoi ça te met
d'une telle bonne humeur ?
Ils ne vont pas
nous transformer en forçats.
Toi le poète, tu vas commencer
par te débarrasser de cette attitude.
Je marche pas.
C'est marrant que tu penses
que tu aies le choix.
Alors on abandonne
le commerce de la came, d'un coup ?
Si je le fais, toi aussi.
Vous n'avez pas à me rejoindre
tout de suite, d'accord ?
Soyez prêt à neuf heures
demain matin.
Allez, Burr. Merde.
Pas la peine de vous forcer
à croire que j'ai raison,
parce que je vais vous prouver
que j'ai raison.
Vous comptez le publier quand,
le livre d'Augustus Hill ?
On espérait le publier ce moi-ci.
C'est pour ça qu'on voulait vous voir.
Il y a un hic au niveau de la personne
qui détient les droits.
Augustus a fait un testament stipulant
que toutes les recettes de ce livre
iraient à une association d'aide aux
prisonniers, comme la Fortune Society.
Oui, mais sa femme Anabella...
Son ex-femme. Elle a divorcé.
Elle prétend que le divorce n'était pas
finalisé au moment où il est mort,
et qu'elle est
l'héritière légale des droits.
En plus, on a reçu une injonction de la
part de la famille de Lawrence Hudack.
Le policier qu'Augustus a tué ?
L'état a passé une loi après l'affaire
"Fils de Sam". Tout l'argent du livre
doit aller à un fond
pour les victimes.
Kareem, on a des mois,
peut-être des années
de procès devant nous.
Qu'est-ce que
vous voulez me dire ?
Vous n'allez pas
publier le livre ?
L'industrie de l'édition
ne va pas bien en ce moment.
Et ces mémoires,
mêmes si elles sont bien écrites,
ne feront pas un best seller.
Et si je le rendais rentable,
en diminuant
vos coûts d'impression ?
Comment ferez-vous ça ?
Une inspiration.
Attends une minute,
reviens en arrière.
Tu veux créer
ta propre entreprise ?
Oui, dans le domaine
de la reliure de livres.
J'ai fait des recherches.
C'est une affaire parfaite
à gérer depuis Oz.
J'imagine que tu ne vas pas demander
une aide de l'Etat pour ton projet ?
Non, nous autres musulmans mettrons
nos comptes en banque en jeu.
C'est un risque limité.
Mes éditeurs ont accepté de me laisser
produire le livre d'Augustus pour eux.
Ils m'ont présenté
à plusieurs clients potentiels.
Je croyais que tu étais contre
le concept de la main d'œuvre carcérale.
Pas le concept,
mais sa mise en pratique.
Je ne vais pas pousser
un compétiteur local à faire faillite,
puisqu'il n'y en a pas.
Et ce qui est encore
plus important, McManus,
c'est que je paierai
un salaire décent,
Le SMlC.
Alors tu vas débourser 5,25 $
de l'heure de ta poche.
Au début, oui. Mais avec
les bénéfices que je compte faire,
je prévois de rentrer dans mes frais
en six semaines.
Je ne vois pas
de raison valable de dire non.
Et toi ?
Vous savez, si on continue à
développer nos propres industries,
Oz va finir en couverture
de "Fortune 500".
Regardez ça, mes frères.
Pour certains,
c'est un livre ordinaire.
Et pourtant, je crois que
ce que je tiens dans ma main
est le passé...
Ce qui a été écrit.
Le présent...
Ce qui peut être lu maintenant.
Et l'avenir...
Le travail glorieux qui nous attend.
Nous, les musulmans,
nous allons montrer le chemin
au reste du monde, pour qu'ils voient
comment les travailleurs
peuvent être traités
de manière équitable,
traités avec respect.
Nous ferons preuve d'une vraie fierté
dans notre artisanat,
et nous ferons la démonstration,
une bonne fois pour toutes,
que des hommes qui s'unissent
peuvent ensemble devenir une force
pour le bien,
dans la célébration
de l'esprit d'Allah.
Maintenant,
je demande votre aide.
Je demande votre dévouement.
Je vous demande
un engagement absolu.
- Vous êtes avec moi ?
- Oui !
Je ne vous entends pas,
vous êtes avec moi ?
- Oui !
- Allahu Akbar.
- Allahu Akbar !
- Allahu Akbar !
- Allahu Akbar !
- Allahu Akbar !
Allahu Akbar !
Toutes les prières
sont pour Allah.
Le chemin que
tu traces sera difficile.
Oui, mais le combat
en vaut la peine.
En faisant partie de la publication
du livre d'Augustus,
La population d'Oz
toute entière sera régénérée.
J'ai pris contact
avec Anabella Hill
et la famille Hudack.
Je suis en train d'essayer de régler
leurs plaintes déposées en justice.
Qui c'est ?
Il est journaliste.
Il va écrire un papier
sur notre nouvelle entreprise.
- Attends ici.
- D'accord.
Kareem Said.
Mr Idzik.
Clouez-le.
Saisissez son feu.
Arif...
Ne lui fais pas de mal.
C'est bon, tout ira bien.
Tu vas t'en sortir, allez.
Respire, respire.
Respire, s'il te plaît.
William Congreve a dit :
"La musique a des charmes
pour apaiser la bête sauvage,
pour adoucir les rochers
ou faire plier le chêne noueux".
Mais que se passe-t-il
quand la musique s'arrête ?
Quand il n'y a plus de mélodie ?
Quand tout ce qu'on entend...
C'est le silence ?
Le son assourdissant
et doucereux du néant.
Le néant complet.
La Sainte Bible
Mon Combat
Au début,
il y avait la parole.
La parole était avec Dieu
et la parole était Dieu.
Depuis le pistolet de départ,
tout tourne autour d'elle.
De la communication.
Des millions de millénaires
sont passés et l'homme est arrivé.
Dieu voulait bavarder
avec quelqu'un.
Il se trouve que
l'homme veut plus que ça.
Il veut la page des potins,
le sexe par téléphone,
des rediffusions de "Seinfeld"
et des enchères virtuelles.
Il a son propre plan
concernant la communication
et les inventions pour la réaliser.
Et Dieu, le pauvre...
Il n'a toujours personne
à qui parler.
Merci d'être venue
si vite.
Dites-moi
ce qui s'est passé.
Il y a une heure environ,
un homme se faisant passer
pour un reporter
est venu rendre visite
à Kareem Said.
- Il a sorti un pistolet...
- Il a abattu Said.
Oh mon Dieu.
Fous le camp d'ici !
Votre carte de presse
indique que votre nom
est Lemuel Idzik.
Est-ce que c'est
votre vrai nom ?
Qui inventerait
un nom pareil ?
Oui.
Idzik.
Je suis le détective McGorry,
des Homicides.
Je dois vous poser
des questions.
Je l'ai fait.
J'ai tué Kareem Said.
Quoi d'autre ?
Vous accepteriez
de signer des aveux.
Oui.
Ecrivez les mots
et je signerai
de ma plus belle écriture.
Après la lecture de vos droits, je veux
que vous me disiez ce qui s'est passé.
Voici tout ce que je dirai.
Je devais le tuer
avant la tombée de la nuit.
Leo, nous avons reçu
une demande d'une TV locale
voulant avoir confirmation
de la mort de Said.
Merde ! Comment ça s'est su ?
Les Musulmans ont dû
les contacter.
Ne rappelez pas
la station tout de suite.
Ils ont dit qu'ils envoient
un camion reportage.
Ne les laissez pas entrer
dans le complexe.
Faites-les stationner
en face de Monroe Boulevard.
C'était relativement facile.
- Idzik a dit pourquoi il a tué Said ?
- Non.
Il a parlé sans cesse
de la tombée de la nuit,
quoi que ça puisse signifier.
Je vais l'emmener
au centre-ville.
Je vais trouver
comment un homme armé
a pu entrer à Oz.
D'après le registre,
vous avez fait entrer Lemuel Idzik.
Il semble que oui, Chef.
Vous l'avez fouillé
pour voir s'il était armé ?
Il est passé
par le détecteur
comme tout le monde.
La machine n'a pas sonné ?
Non, Chef.
Je l'aurais remarqué.
Breese, je vous ai donné
deux blâmes
pour ivresse
pendant le service.
Votre haleine sent l'alcool.
- Ma femme a le cancer.
- Je m'en moque !
Vous avez un travail à faire,
une responsabilité.
Vous y avez manqué.
Le résultat,
c'est qu'un homme est mort.
Un prisonnier.
Voici ce que vous allez faire.
Enlevez votre uniforme
et foutez le camp
de ma prison !
Comme ça va, ce ne sera plus
la vôtre longtemps.
Nom de Dieu,
mais qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Le Maire Loewen,
Harrison Beecher, Schibetta, Kirk
et maintenant Kareem Said,
tous assassinés en quelques semaines.
Il ne semble pas y avoir
de lien entre ces meurtres.
C'est censé me réconforter ?
Vous avez des suspects
pour l'affaire Wilson Loewen ?
Il y avait 11 hommes
dans la section ce soir-là.
Ce sont tous
des suspects.
La difficulté,
c'est de restreindre la liste.
Choisissez
un de ces salopards.
M. le Gouverneur,
vous ne me suggérez pas de faire ça ?
Je suggère que vous fassiez
votre boulot et vite
avant que je dise
au Préfet de police
de mettre un autre
Sherlock en charge.
Alors, Détective,
qu'en dites-vous ?
Ça me dépasse.
La réponse facile,
c'est qu'un noir a assassiné Loewen,
mais je sens
que ce n'est pas ça.
Il ne s'agit pas de préjudice racial.
C'est... personnel.
Quelqu'un a embauché
quelqu'un pour tuer Loewen.
Oui, mais qui et pourquoi ?
Antonio Nappa
Mort étouffé à Oz
L'imprimerie a changé
le monde pour toujours,
et pour le mieux.
Des bibles ont été imprimées
en langue courante plutôt qu'en latin
et ont sorti Dieu
de l'Age des Ténèbres,
des coins sombres
et l'ont amené aux gens ordinaires
comme vous et moi.
Mais imaginez le vieux Gutenberg
à un kiosque de presse aujourd'hui.
Vous croyez qu'il serait fier
d'avoir ouvert la voie à "Jugs",
"High Times"
et "Soldier of Fortune" ?
Regardez qui est de retour.
Pourquoi ce camion
de reportage dehors ?
Vous savez,
les mêmes bêtises.
Des objets métalliques.
Passez.
Qui venez-vous voir ?
Mon client, Chris Keller.
Client ? C'est comme ça
qu'on dit, maintenant ?
Avez-vous de l'alcool, de la drogue,
des armes ou des explosifs ?
- Non.
- Très bien, signez là.
Votre n° de Sécurité sociale ici,
votre couleur préférée là.
Un peu d'humour,
ça coupe la journée.
Vous entrez ou non,
Beecher ?
- Tobias...
- Hé.
Tobias, j'ai...
J'ai des nouvelles terribles.
Kareem Said est mort.
Quoi ?
L'affaire du meurtre
de Brice Tibbet.
Un témoin s'est présenté.
Imaginez.
Nous allons déposer
une demande aujourd'hui
pour faire annuler
ta condamnation à mort.
Toby, penses-tu
qu'il y a une chance ?
Je veux dire,
avec ce témoin oculaire ?
Tu sais,
il est la clé de tout.
Je me suis demandé
pourquoi Jerry Heekin
a attendu quatre ans
pour contacter les autorités.
Et puis le cabinet d'avocats
a fait des recherches.
Il a été pris vendant de la coke,
ton père me l'avait dit.
L'an dernier. Il été arrêté
pour la 3ème fois. Trois fois, vu ?
En espérant faire un marché,
il est allé au FBl
et a dit qu'il t'a vu
jeter le corps de Brice Tibbet.
Qu'il t'ait vu ou non,
c'est sans importance,
parce que ton copain,
l'Agent Taylor
a dû l'aider à trouver
la plupart des détails.
Dans sa conversation initiale
avec le FBl,
Heekin ne dit rien
de la lampe de poche.
Ce n'est qu'après,
en parlant au Procureur,
qu'il l'ajoute à l'histoire.
C'est n'importe quoi,
pas vrai ?
Tu aurais remarqué une lampe
de poche braquée sur toi,
surtout si tu étais en train
de jeter un corps.
Grand Dieu, c'est ce que
j'ai toujours dit à McClain.
L'essentiel, c'est qu'il a pu
faire un marché avec le Procureur
en attendant ta condamnation.
A cause de ça, nous pouvons
affirmer qu'Heekin a tout inventé
ou que l'Agent Taylor
le lui a raconté.
Un témoignage non-fiable,
plus inconduite
de l'Avocat Général
égalent un verdict annulé.
C'est beau, ça.
Les filles, vous pouvez
glousser moins fort ?
Je ferais mieux
d'aller au tribunal.
Hé, on n'a parlé
que de conneries légales.
Comment tu vas
après la mort de ton père
et maintenant Said ?
Tu peux pleurer.
Je suis désolé.
Toby, c'est comment
d'être libre ?
C'est, euh...
Le zoo,
le stade de foot.
On est dehors
constamment, tu sais.
Je passe du temps
avec mes gosses, du vrai temps.
Des petites choses,
les aider à faire leurs devoirs...
Aller à des réunions
de l'association des parents.
La prof de Holly est une femme
très drôle et intelligente.
Tu l'adorerais.
Elle est...
elle me fait éclater de rire.
Je suis heureux
pour toi, Toby.
- Je suis heureux pour toi.
- Qu'est-ce que je vous ai dit ?
Pas de bécotage.
Il faut que tu y ailles.
Fais-moi sortir d'ici.
Eloigne-moi de Lopresti,
Bon Dieu !
Merci, Officier.
Bonjour.
- Salut, ma belle.
- On est de bonne humeur, hein ?
Conformément
à une nouvelle loi de l'Etat,
tous les six mois,
je dois évaluer
La santé mentale
de chaque prisonnier
condamné à mort
et c'est votre tour.
Comment est
votre santé mentale ?
Beecher pense que
ma condamnation va être annulée.
Je sais.
Je l'ai vu tout à l'heure.
Comment l'avez-vous trouvé ?
Il a du chagrin
après la mort
de son père et Said.
Je veux dire,
en dehors de ça.
Qu'est-ce que vous me demandez,
exactement ?
Beecher est amoureux.
Vraiment ? Il vous l'a dit ?
Je le vois.
Que ressentez-vous ?
Je ne sais pas.
Voyons, Chris,
ne vous moquez pas de moi.
Que ressentez-vous ?
Je suis heureux !
- Pour lui ?
- Oui.
Et pour vous ?
Jaloux.
Qu'allez-vous faire
de cette jalousie ?
La mordre ? La sucer ?
La dévorer en entier ?
Oui, bien sûr !
Beecher a ce que je veux.
Je veux une vie !
Je serai exécuté
et il vivra une longue vie
entouré de ses petits-enfants.
Je veux une vie !
Vous ne pouvez pas comprendre
que je sois un peu envieux ?
Bien sûr que si.
Si vous l'aimez vraiment,
je m'attends à ça et plus encore.
Je noterai que
vous vous comportez normalement.
Le courrier !
Hé, Vern, j'ai entendu
pour ton copain Loewen.
Une tragédie.
Une putain de tragédie.
Eh bien,
regardez-moi ça.
Nous trois ensemble
de nouveau.
Je suis si touché.
Hé, Vern,
attends un instant.
Ecoute ça.
Toi aussi, Lopresti.
"En considération des arguments
pertinents qui précèdent,
en général et sur jugement
de la Cour, blablabla,
je suis contraint de conclure
que l'appel du requérant
est méritoire".
- Ce qui veut dire ?
- Tu sors d'ici.
- Sans blague ?
- Sans blague.
Youhou ! Ouais !
Toby.
Je te dois la vie.
Je te dois la vie.
Je te dois la vie.
Winthrop.
Tu es Keller,
n'est-ce pas ?
Ouais.
- J'ai entendu des histoires sur toi.
- Ah bon ?
Et moi sur toi aussi.
Il y en a une en particulier
qui m'intéresse.
Je t'intéresse ?
Je dirais plutôt
que tu me fascines.
Viens me retrouver
dans le placard
de rangement, unité B.
D'accord.
Super.
Je croyais que tu n'avais
d'yeux que pour Beecher.
C'est grâce à Beecher
qu'on est là tous les deux.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
- Cette histoire que j'ai entendue,
celle qui me fascine.
Ouais ?
C'est celle où tu tues
le père de Beecher.
Non, non !
Non, non !
Hé, Keller.
Quel effet ça te fait d'être
de retour avec nous ?
Sympa.
Un jour en 1876,
Alexander Graham Bell
a dit à travers un fil,
"Watson, viens ici.
Je te veux".
130 années plus tard,
nous parlons par satellites.
C'est étrange
mais avant de raccrocher,
nous disons :
"Restons en contact"
alors qu'il n'y a
pas de contact,
on ne se touche pas.
Seulement des câbles
et des fréquences.
Pourtant...
quand on reçoit un appel
qui dit "je t'aime"
au milieu
d'une journée merdique,
on trouve que le téléphone portable,
c'est miraculeux.
Dans l'ensemble,
les choses démarrent bien.
Quelques problèmes,
mais rien que je n'aie pas prévu.
J'avoue que je suis
du genre à raccrocher
dès que je sens
le démarchage.
Avec quel pourcentage
de ces appels obtenez-vous
des donations pour la campagne
du Sénateur Laken ?
Croyez-le ou non, il suffit
d'un taux de 1 à 2%
pour que le télémarketing
soit efficace.
2% ?
J'aime qu'on fasse mieux.
Nous atteignons 5-6%.
Vos hommes
se montrent très efficaces.
- Mme Howard ?
- Oui.
Bonjour. Je vous appelle
dans le cadre de la campagne
de réélection du Sénateur
Archibald Laken.
Pouvez-vous m'accorder
un instant ?
- Bien sûr.
- Merci.
Bonjour M. Erickson.
Je vous appelle dans le cadre de...
Bonjour, Mme Sharif.
Persévérez, Kenaniah,
persévérez.
Les accomplissements
du Sénateur Laken sont excellents,
surtout en ce qui concerne
l'éducation,
La sécurité nationale,
et la répression criminelle.
Les autres tiennent le coup ?
Nous sommes tristes...
démoralisés, vous savez.
Kareem avait prévu qu'on lance
une entreprise de reliure
et les préparatifs
sont en cours.
Le premier livre devait être
les Mémoires d'Augustus Hill.
Il faut continuer, Zahir.
Afin de les honorer
tous les deux,
vous devez encourager
vos hommes à accomplir la tâche
que Said avait prévue
pour vous.
J'ai essayé une fois
d'être le leader.
J'ai échoué.
Vous savez,
Said et moi,
on n'était pas toujours d'accord
mais je sais une chose,
en ce moment,
il aurait eu confiance en Allah.
J'ai parlé à l'éditeur
du livre de Hill.
Il veut continuer.
C'est à nous
de respecter la promesse,
de réaliser la vision
du Ministre Said.
Mais d'abord,
nous devons choisir un chef.
Je désigne Zahir Arif.
Tous ceux en sa faveur ?
Vous m'avez traité
de quoi ?
Va te faire foutre,
grosse salope.
- Hé, Poet !
- Tu crois que je ne sais pas
où est le 122 Wayne Street ?
Tu verras, salope.
Putain, qu'est-ce que tu as ?
Elle a dit
qu'elle n'allait pas donner
son n° de carte de crédit
à un black inconnu.
- Comment elle sait que je suis noir.
- Ce n'est pas une raison.
Tu raccroches et tu fais
calmement l'appel suivant.
Mon cul. Je ne mettrai pas
ma fierté en jeu
pour qu'un connard de sénateur
soit réélu.
Dans ce cas,
tu es viré.
- Quoi ?
- Tu m'as entendu.
Dégage ton cul feignant
et ta mauvaise disposition
hors d'ici !
- Dépêche-toi.
- Va te faire foutre, Burr.
Va te faire foutre !
Mais qu'est-ce que
vous regardez donc !
Remettez-vous au travail.
Tout le monde.
C'est bien qu'on soit
sortis maintenant.
Je te le dis.
Ce télémarketing, mec,
- cette merde court-circuite le cerveau.
- Ouais, c'est vrai.
Mais j'ai un plan.
Ouais, on va bosser
pour Arif.
McManus et les Siciliens
penseront
qu'on a fini de dealer.
On restera tranquilles
un instant
et on reviendra
deux fois plus vite
en dessous du radar
sans Burr.
- Vous voyez ce que je veux dire ?
- Ouais, mec.
On dirait
qu'il y a foule là-bas.
Oui, je sais.
J'ai parlé avec la femme
d'Augustus et la famille Hudack.
Tout le monde est d'accord
sur les royalties
pour qu'on puisse avancer.
C'est excitant.
Ouais, et terrifiant.
On devrait ouvrir
les portes ?
Nacim, ferme la porte.
Attends encore une minute.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Attendez.
On doit prier.
On doit prier.
Mlle Coffo.
J'ai fini le livre.
- C'était rapide.
- Il était bien, amusant.
Asseyez-vous et dites-moi
ce que vous avez aimé ou non.
Je ne peux pas.
J'ai des choses à faire.
- Des choses à faire ?
- Je reviendrai demain.
Entre-temps, pouvez-vous
me trouver un autre livre ?
Sur le baseball ?
Peu importe, du moment
que c'est amusant et bien.
Bob, je suis complètement troublé.
Bonjour, Stella.
Je dois voir Norma aujourd'hui
et soudain, j'hésite.
N'hésite pas, Agamemnon.
Mets une cravate,
de l'après-rasage,
coiffe tes cheveux en arrière
comme toujours.
Il est temps que Norma et moi
on se voit tels qu'on est.
Taches de vieillesse et tout.
Pourquoi je m'impose ça ?
Parce qu'une partie de toi
est amoureuse
et c'est cette partie
qui compte.
Tu lis trop de poésie, Bob.
L'amour, c'est nul, rappelle-toi.
Bonjour.
Je suis contente
de te voir.
Passons les politesses.
On sait pourquoi on est là.
Je devrais tout expliquer
tout de suite.
Après m'avoir laissé en plan à l'église
et puis être tombée enceinte,
- oui, tu devrais faire ça.
- D'accord.
J'ai été coincée
dans la tempête de neige
sur le chemin
pour aller à notre mariage.
Pendant ce temps,
j'ai eu le temps de réfléchir.
Je me disais toujours
que je pourrais supporter
d'être mariée à un prisonnier.
Alors que j'étais assise là-bas,
j'ai vu clairement
combien ce serait difficile.
J'ai appelé Elliot
sur mon portable.
Elliot ?
Qui est Elliot ?
L'homme avec qui j'étais
quand je t'ai rencontré.
Tu avais un ami
quand on s'est rencontrés
et tu l'as plaqué
pour moi ?
- Oui.
- Ouah.
Elliot est venu me sortir
de la neige et on est allés dîner.
Il m'a dit que sa mère
venait de mourir
et on a noyé nos chagrins
dans une bouteille de vin bon marché.
Une chose en a entraîné
une autre et...
Il t'a eu comme dessert.
En couchant avec lui,
j'ai pensé à toi.
Ce n'est pas une illusion,
ce qu'on ressent.
C'est de l'amour.
"Ne pense pas,
tu ne peux pas pleurer
et ton Créateur
n'est pas proche.
Il nous donne Sa joie
pour détruire notre chagrin
jusqu'à ce qu'il s'en aille.
Il reste avec nous
et soupire".
J'aime le timbre
de votre voix, Robert.
Dépêche, Rebadow.
Encore cinq minutes
jusqu'à l'appel.
Je serai là
dans quatre minutes.
Ne sois pas en retard,
l'amoureux.
Savez-vous que Blake
et sa femme se faisaient
La lecture dans leur jardin,
tout nus ?
Sans se soucier
des passants.
Ça va vous sembler fou, Stella,
mais je veux faire ça
avec vous, juste une fois.
Il y a un jardin à Oz ?
Je pourrais payer un garde
pour que nous soyons dans l'intimité
et vous pourriez apporter
une plante.
Nous fermera la porte,
éteindrons les lumières,
et nous mettrons
près d'une bougie pour lire
"Le mariage du ciel
et de l'enfer",
tout nus comme le jour
de notre naissance.
C'est une idée charmante,
mais je ne sais pas
si je pourrais finir
ce que j'ai commencé là.
Robert, je suis malade.
Je viens d'apprendre
que j'ai le cancer du sein.
Ne commencez pas
à imaginer le pire.
Ça va aller.
Je ne peux pas être
en retard pour l'appel.
Ça va.
Bien.
Bien est le mot
le plus évasif qui existe.
J'ai réfléchi.
Je laisserai peut-être
Norma amener son bébé.
- Oh.
- Je ne suis pas sûr.
Elle avait plaqué le crétin
pour moi d'abord.
Je suppose qu'au fond,
on n'a pas besoin de grand-chose
- pour faire rebondir son ego.
- Ah oui.
D'ailleurs,
il s'appelle Elliot.
Qui serait jaloux
d'un gars qui s'appelle Elliot ?
Bob, qu'est-ce que
tu as aujourd'hui ?
Tu te rappelles que tu m'as dit
que je devrais la voir ?
J'ai oublié de te dire
d'être prudent.
Tu es rempli d'illusions,
Agamemnon.
La voir, oui mais
fais attention à tes fesses.
Tu as dit toi-même
que l'amour, c'est nul.
Il n'y a rien d'autre à attendre
de nos souffrances
que plus de souffrance encore.
Au milieu du 20ème siècle,
L'homme a voulu la communication
sans la communication !
Il a voulu être assis
dans son salon
et regarder des gens
dans une boîte,
tomber amoureux,
travailler, chanter,
jouer au golf,
pleurer, baiser,
et foutre la merde.
La télévision !
Une conversation à sens unique
entre vous et le monde,
où le monde a la parole !
Comme Dieu,
L'homme peut enfin
créer l'homme
à sa propre image
et puis se reposer et regarder
toutes sortes de merdes arriver.
Allez, Cyril,
c'est l'heure d'un autre traitement
T.E.C. fabuleux.
C'est quoi T.E.C. ?
Pourquoi est-ce
qu'à chaque fois,
je dois vous dire
ce que signifie T.E.C. ?
Parce que les électrochocs
provoquent la perte de mémoire.
Oh.
Jaz ?
Jaz ?
Jaz, il faut qu'on parle,
c'est très important.
Votre exécution est prévue
la semaine prochaine.
16 diables.
Aujourd'hui, il y en avait 16.
J'apprécie que vous soyez
passée me voir, Mlle Lang.
Je suis ravie quand quelqu'un
s'intéresse à Jaz Hoyt.
Arnie Zelman reçoit toute la publicité
du bloc des condamnés à mort
pour son client,
Cyril O'Reily.
Zelman est un génie
des relations publiques.
Où en est l'appel de Hoyt ?
Grâce aux témoignages
de divers psychiatres,
dont certains ont soigné
Hoyt depuis l'âge de 6 ans,
j'ai pu constituer
un dossier assez solide.
Vous affirmez
qu'il a toujours été fou ?
Oui.
Enfant, il a torturé
des animaux,
sodomisé un camarade.
Où étaient ses parents pendant
ce temps ? Dans un bar, ivres ?
En fait, à Captiva.
Hoyt vient d'une famille
avec de l'argent, Père Mukada,
beaucoup d'argent.
Il est allé à Exeter.
Il a abandonné ses études à Harvard.
Son truc "Jaz, le méchant motard"
fait partie de ses fantasmes.
Mince alors,
il est riche ?
Qui paie mes honoraires,
croyez-vous ?
Pater et mater.
J'entendais la musique
et j'ai vu
un autre buffle.
Et j'ai vu un chien
et j'ai vu un...
J'ai vu deux loups,
j'ai vu... deux loups
Sur une note
plus controversée,
marquant l'échec étonnant
des procureurs de l'Etat
La condamnation à mort
du meurtrier Jaz Hoyt a été commuée.
Au lieu d'être exécuté
comme prévu,
Hoyt sera transféré au service
psychiatrique du Centre Oswald
et plus tard
à l'lnstitut Connelly,
à Morrisville, spécialisé dans
le traitement des fous criminels.
C'est n'importe quoi ! Pourquoi
ce putain de Hoyt sort et pas Cyril ?
D'un point de vue purement légal,
les circonstances
de chaque affaire
sont très différentes.
Aux yeux de la loi,
la vie de Hoyt
vaut la peine d'être préservée
mais pas celle de mon frère ?
- Je crains que oui, Ryan.
- Nom de Dieu !
A moins que notre dernier appel
soit accepté par la Cour,
Cyril mourra jeudi
dans 2 semaines.
Putain !
Prisonnier n° 03N679 :
Jahfree Neema ;
reconnu coupable
le 10 janvier 2003 ;
kidnapping, agression ;
condamnation : 7 ans ;
éligible pour la liberté
conditionnelle dans 3 ans.
Autres nouvelles : Jahfree Neema,
radical des années 60
a été reconnu coupable
d'avoir kidnappé sa fille
de la crèche Pinkel.
M. Neema, leader noir
bien connu de l'est de la ville
était autrefois membre
des Black Panthers.
Ce château est situé
dans un endroit agréable.
L'air léger et sucré
est agréable
à nos doux sens.
Cette quête de l'été,
ce martinet hantant le temple...
C'est tout.
La répétition est finie.
- Mais je n'ai même pas...
- Demain à 3 h.
Pas de problème,
on y arrivera. Merci.
- Ça marche, Maman ?
- Oh, Ryan,
pas vraiment.
Nous n'avons trouvé personne
pour remplacer Schibetta
dans le rôle principal et...
Je dois te parler,
- mais je ne sais pas où commencer.
- Commence.
D'accord.
- Jahfree Neema va venir à Oz.
- Maman, sérieusement.
Je connais cet homme.
Du moins, je le connaissais.
C'est lui
qui m'a convaincue
d'entrer dans le mouvement
de la paix. C'est lui qui...
C'est pour lui que tu as quitté Papa
et que tu m'as abandonné ?
C'est une façon
de voir les choses.
Il était très passionné
à propos de ces convictions.
- C'est un homme très charismatique...
- Tu as baisé avec lui ?
Tu l'as fait.
Ryan, nous sommes
tous deux des adultes.
Tu sais comment c'était
de vivre avec ton père.
Il était très répressif
et Jahfree m'a aidé à me libérer.
Je te dis ça
car je veux que tu saches
qu'il a changé ma vie
pour le mieux.
Ah ha.
Je te demande d'être
ouvert à lui, c'est tout.
Je suis impatient
de le rencontrer.
Je l'appellerai
peut-être oncle Jahfree.
A plus, mec.
Hé.
Comment va, mec ?
Je vous connais ?
Indirectement.
Suzanne Fitzgerald, c'est ma mère.
Et alors ?
Sortez de ma cellule.
Elle m'a demandé de venir ici
et d'essayer de, vous savez...
Sors de ma cellule,
mec blanc.
Connard.
Hé.
Dans les années 60,
Le Département de la Défense
a créé l'internet.
Ils n'avaient pas idée
qu'ils mélangeaient le béton
pour construire
le village global.
Mais ça n'a rien
de concret.
Les gens reçoivent
du courrier digital
de boîtes électroniques.
Ils se réunissent
dans des salles de discussion
qui n'ont ni murs,
ni portes.
Des millions de personnes
ont instantanément accès
Les unes aux autres, à des magasins,
de la nourriture et des distractions.
Mais si c'est une telle révolution
dans les communications,
pourquoi les études
montrent-elles
que plus on passe
de temps en ligne,
plus on souffre d'isolement.
Nous avons été contactés
par l'avocat de Greg Penders,
qui est en régime cellulaire.
Il fait un procès à l'Etat.
A cause de l'empoisonnement
au chlorure de méthylène ?
Oui, il dit que la mort
de Carlos Martinez
est la preuve que la prison
met sa propre vie en danger.
Penders incite
la famille Martinez
- et Omar White à se joindre au procès.
- Mon Dieu.
Je vous avais prévenu
de ne pas faire
cette conférence de presse trop tôt.
- Ellie, SVP !
La dernière chose que j'ai besoin
d'entendre c'est : "Je vous avais dit".
Ça va marcher Omar,
je le garantis.
Je le garantis.
Tout le monde sait
que l'air ici est toxique,
qu'il est toxique à chier.
Tu dois te joindre
à mon procès.
Tu dois le faire.
Il paraît que
vous voulez me parler.
Omar, qui est là ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Vous me laissez sortir
du régime cellulaire,
je retourne à Emerald City
d'accord ?
Et je ne ferai pas de procès
avec Penders.
C'est tout ce que je reçois
en échange ?
Qu'est-ce que
vous voulez d'autre ?
Regardez... Je n'ai pas
grand-chose à offrir.
Voilà ce qu'on va faire.
Je vous remets
à Emerald City
et vous ne dites pas un mot
à personne de cette conversation.
Pas une putain de syllabe.
Au diable les syllabes,
pas une seule lettre, d'accord ?
Mais si vous parlez,
je construirai
une cellule si petite
que vous n'aurez pas
la place de tenir debout.
Il y aura juste assez
de place pour vous
et votre bouche
de bavard, compris ?
Nous ne nous sommes
jamais parlés.
Omar.
White retourne à Em City ?
C'est pas possible, Leo.
J'en ai assez de ces conneries.
Tim, vous croyez vraiment
que je vais faire passer
vos états d'âme
avec un prisonnier
avant les autres priorités
de la prison ? Je ne pense pas.
Allah Akbar.
Allah Akbar.
Arif, où est
mon copain Said ?
Allah Akbar.
- Sérieusement, où est-il ?
- Said est mort, White.
- Quoi ?
- Quelqu'un l'a abattu.
Viens, allons-y.
McManus.
McManus.
- McManus.
- Maintenant, White !
Le rapport d'autopsie
concernant Carlos Martinez.
Vous serez content de savoir
qu'il n'est pas mort
d'empoisonnement par
le chlorure de méthylène. Il a étouffé.
- Ou a été étouffé par quelqu'un.
- Quoi ?
Ça fait un plaignant de moins
dont vous avez à vous soucier.
Vous êtes encore
fâchée contre moi
de ne pas l'avoir envoyé
à Benchley Memorial ?
Oui.
Pas autant que je suis fâchée
contre moi-même.
Vous savez ce qui est
dégoûtant là-dedans ?
Je suis soulagée qu'il ait été tué
dans son sommeil
plutôt que de mourir
d'une mort évitable.
Maintenant,
je ne suis pas coupable.
Maintenant, je...
je suis horrifiée de me voir
penser comme ça.
C'est la dernière fois
que je fais passer Oz
avant une personne.
Super.
J'ai une autre enquête
de meurtre sur les bras.
Vous m'accusez
d'avoir tué Martinez ?
Normalement, on pourrait
balayer ça sous le tapis.
Mais avec cette série
de meurtres
et l'affaire du chlorure
de méthylène,
pour laquelle j'ai promis
de publier l'autopsie,
Les média
ne laisseront pas tomber.
Ils exigeront une enquête.
Je dois connaître
chaque détail.
D'accord. Désolé.
Vous avez dit que vous avez vu
Martinez avant sa mort.
Oui.
Martinez m'a fait savoir
qu'il voulait me voir
parce qu'il voulait avouer
que c'était Morales
qui lui avait ordonné
de me couper le tendon.
Vous avez vu quelque chose
de suspect ?
Une menace
des autres malades ?
Non.
Un des Latinos
a dû faire le coup, chef.
Ils travaillent comme infirmiers
dans le service.
Ils avaient des occasions
et des motifs.
D'empêcher Martinez
de balancer Morales ?
Oui.
Ecoutez, Dave,
Je vais faire venir
l'unité des homicides,
comme je l'ai fait
pour le meurtre de Loewen.
Ils pourraient vous faire passer
un test au détecteur de mensonges.
Alors, je suis un suspect.
Malheureusement,
pour l'instant,
vous êtes
le suspect n° 1.
Je suis si innocent
que ça me fait mal.
Alors, pourquoi
te fais-tu du souci ?
Passe le putain de test.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Pourquoi ?
Parce que j'ai menti.
Je ne comprends pas.
J'ai menti en disant
que Martinez dénonçait Morales.
- Quoi ?
- Je n'ai pas vu Martinez ce soir-là.
Oh mon Dieu, Dave.
Toi et moi, on sait
que Morales est coupable.
J'ai utilisé la mort de Martinez
comme une occasion
pour attraper
ce fils de put.
Ce qu'ont a fait,
isoler Morales...
était totalement justifié.
Non, parce qu'on n'avait pas
de preuve.
Ne joue pas le vertueux
avec moi, crétin.
C'est ma jambe qui a été blessée,
ma vie qui a été foutue en l'air.
Tu dois aller dire
la vérité à Glynn.
- On doit sortir Morales de l'isolement.
- Non.
Si tu ne le fais pas,
je le ferai.
Va te faire foutre !
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
Arrêtez.
Arrêtez. Dégage.
- Dr Nathan ?
- Bonjour.
Entrez.
Merci d'être venue.
Je veux m'excuser
de m'être tant fâchée
Le soir où Martinez est mort
et vous avoir renvoyée.
L'affaire de
l'empoisonnement chimique
m'a beaucoup
stressée et je sais
ce que c'est d'être accusée
pour des choses
qu'on ne contrôle pas
vraiment.
Si vous voulez encore
votre emploi, il est à vous.
Merci, Dr Nathan.
Je ferai de mon mieux,
je vous le jure.
Eh bien,
allons travailler.
Enrique, j'ai entendu
ce qui s'est passé.
Ne t'approche pas de moi,
espèce de Judas.
- Je ne suis pas un Judas.
- Tu as tué Martinez ?
- Quelqu'un d'El Norte l'a tué ?
- Non.
Alors dégage.
Tout va bien ici ?
Pourrais-je avoir
du jus de fruit ?
C'est triste pour votre ami,
Martinez.
Mais c'était
un gars méchant.
Il a mérité de mourir.
Hé.
Je suis content
que tu sois venu.
Je suis content aussi.
Tu es en vachement
meilleure forme que la dernière fois.
Je me suis payé
deux-trois nids de poules.
Je fonce à 100 km
à l'heure
avec la capote descendue.
VlSlTEUR
Puisqu'on en parle,
ça va, ma voiture ?
Je ne sais pas,
mon vieux.
Comment ça ?
Quand j'ai été condamné,
je t'ai donné les clés
et t'ai demandé de la bichonner.
Oui. J'ai fait les réglages,
le polish, mais...
- Quoi ?
- Maritza l'a vendue.
- Quoi ?
- Parce qu'elle lui causait du chagrin.
Elle ne m'a pas dit
qu'elle a vendu la voiture.
Tu l'as vue récemment ?
Oui, tout le temps.
On est voisins,
tu t'en souviens ?
Oui.
Je dois te demander
quelque chose.
J'ai besoin que tu me dises
la vérité, d'accord ?
- Elle baise avec quelqu'un ?
- Oh, Miguel, je...
Je le sens, mon vieux.
Je sais qu'elle le fait.
On est comme des frères,
depuis longtemps.
On ne s'est jamais menti.
J'ai besoin de le savoir.
Dis-le moi. C'est qui ?
Je ne...
Je ne pense pas que...
Mon vieux,
- dis-moi qui c'est ?
- Moi.
C'est moi.
Désolé, Miguel.
Je n'ai pas d'excuses,
mon vieux.
C'est arrivé comme ça.
Espèce de branleur.
Tu vas me frapper ?
Vas-y, frappe-moi.
Alvarez. C'est fini.
Allons-y.
Maintenant que je sais
la vérité sur Maritza,
d'une manière à la con,
je me sens mieux,
tu sais ?
Le fait de ne pas savoir
me rongeait complètement.
Je suis surpris
par deux choses :
Je n'ai pas pleuré
et je n'ai pas tabassé
Reynaldo.
C'est une bonne chose, non ?
Tout arrive pour le mieux,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je voulais le tuer,
mais je ne l'ai pas fait.
Je ne sais pas.
Je fais des progrès.
Qu'est-ce qui nous attend ?
Des micro-puces dans le cerveau ?
La capacité de lire
la pensée les uns des autres ?
C'est trop tard.
Une tribu primitive
dans l'autre Oz...
En Australie...
nous a déjà battus.
Ils parlent sans parler.
Oui, ils sont bien
en avance sur nous
dans le domaine
des communications
et n'ont pas eu à inventer
la moindre chose pour cela.
Ils sont restés en contact
dans le sens originel,
dans le sens aborigène.
J'ai fini.
Ce qui veut dire
que tu as fini aussi.
Va me chercher
une serviette.
Hé, Robson !
- Ça marche ce truc de salope ?
- Dégagez.
Ecoute, les seuls gars
qui détestent Cutler plus que toi,
c'est nous.
Fais donc une faveur
à tout le monde.
Le buter ?
Y a pas d'inconvénient.
Ça prouvera à la bande
que tu es encore un homme.
Et tu te feras des amis
à la cuisine.
Tu gagnes
à tous les coups.
"Je ne continuerai pas.
J'ai peur de penser
à ce que j'ai fait.
Je n'ose pas
regarder à nouveau".
"lnfirme du courage.
Donne-moi les poignards.
- Les endormis et les morts..."
- Arrêtez.
Je ne pige pas.
Qu'est-ce qui vous trouble,
Wolfgang ?
- Je viens de tuer le roi. D'accord ?
- D'accord.
Je descends
avec ces poignards ensanglantés
et maintenant,
je suis une femmelette.
Vous savez...
Macbeth doute
des implications
de son acte.
Je suis censé laisser cette salope
régler les choses pour moi ?
- Vous n'arrivez pas à le faire.
- Attention, chérie.
Hm.
Vous pourriez regarder
la dernière réplique ?
"Pour mon acte connaître,
point ne dois-je me connaître".
Qu'est-ce que
ça signifie pour vous ?
Dites-le moi donc.
Que vous vous haïriez
vous-même,
si vous pensiez aux choses
que vous avez faites.
Comme je disais,
Macbeth est une femmelette.
Ne bouge pas, putain !
Enlève cette merde
de la tête.
Tu aimes ça, pute ?
Tu sais ce qu'on
devrait essayer ?
"On devrait essayer" ?
Depuis quand je me soucie
de ton opinion ?
- Le J.C.R.
- C'est quoi ce truc ?
Jeu du contrôle
de la respiration.
D'abord, tu fais
un nœud coulant, vu ?
- Continue.
- Puis tu le mets autour du cou.
Autour du cou ?
Tu plaisantes ou quoi ?
Non, écoute.
Tu mets le nœud coulant
autour du cou
et tu te pends légèrement.
Tout le sang de ta tête
va tout droit dans ta bite
et alors je te suce.
Quand tu éjacules,
c'est comme si Dieu
te suçait.
Où est le nœud coulant ?
Qui aurait pensé que ces trucs
servent à tant de choses ?
Je vous parlais de cette merde
au sujet de mon père.
De beaucoup de façons,
je suis devenu comme lui.
Je fais des merdes à des gars
dont je ne suis pas fier.
Mais je suis encore
Le petit garçon qui se fait baiser
dans la cabane.
Quelqu'un vous sodomise,
James ?
Wolfgang Cutler.
Je suis de nouveau coincé
avec un dingue.
Mais je suis plus âgé
maintenant
et je vois ça
différemment.
Que voyez-vous ?
En Cutler ?
Un gars qui au fond
est vraiment déprimé
et se hait lui-même vraiment.
Son regard devient
complètement vague
pendant qu'il...
Je pense qu'il serait
plus heureux mort.
En fait,
parfois il est
d'humeur si sombre,
que je pense
qu'il pourrait se tuer.
- Il a parlé de suicide ?
- Non.
Mais toute cette merde
de "Macbeth",
ça l'a vraiment foutu en l'air.
Madame,
vous pourriez lui parler,
avant qu'il fasse
quelque chose de terrible ?
Wolfgang, j'ai demandé
une séance avec vous
mais comme elle devait
commencer il y a 40 minutes,
je suppose
que vous ne viendrez pas.
Vous et moi, on n'a rien
à se dire, Madame.
Je ne suis pas fou.
Etre fou n'est pas
la seule raison pour venir me voir.
Les psys,
c'est pour les pédés.
Wolfgang,
vous n'êtes pas obligé de...
- Ecoute, salope.
- Un problème, Madame ?
Non.
Rien.
Oh, bonjour, Wolfie.
Mince, j'ai dû oublier
de te détacher hier soir.
Merde.
Garde !
Garde !
Base 1, nous avons
un 823 en B.
C'est pas possible.
L'un de vous s'est pendu.
Quand l'homme deviendra
collectivement fou
à force de télécharger
tous les messages mentaux dans l'air,
quand il ne restera plus
d'arbres,
parce qu'il nous aura fallu
tout ce papier pour la presse
et que nous resterons
sans oxygène pour respirer,
alors des satellites saturés
grilleront et tomberont du ciel.
Et nous appellerons
désespérément sur nos portables
ceux que nous aimons
tout en regardant le reality show
des derniers jours de la Terre.
Les communications
seront de nouveau
ce qu'elles étaient au départ.
La parole passant au-dessus
des profondeurs,
au-dessus
du visage de Dieu,
qui, alors,
au lieu de vouloir parler,
sera fatigué d'écouter.
La Sainte Bible
Mon Combat
Un sage a dit un jour :
"La vie est une aventure
au sein du pardon".
On peut placer un saut à l'élastique
d'un pont en Nouvelle Zélande
ou les enterrements
de vie de garçon à Las Vegas
quelques crans plus haut
sur l'échelle de l'aventure.
Mais pensez
aux risques encourus.
Vous pourriez atteindre
les sommets de l'attrition,
et vous faire descendre par une victime
qui refuse de pardonner.
Pensez aux récompenses :
La chance de guérir
ces plaies affreuses,
se réconcilier
avec quelqu'un qu'on aime.
Maintenant que j'y pense,
Le pardon pourrait bien détrôner
le saut à l'élastique
et les enterrements
de vie de garçon du palmarès.
C'est bon.
Faites une pause.
Alors comme ça,
Cutler s'est suicidé ?
C'est ce que dit Reimondo,
- et je ne vais pas dire le contraire.
- Je m'en doutais.
Alors, Vern ? Est-ce que
quelqu'un d'autre doit se suicider
- pour qu'on me respecte ?
- Bon Dieu, Robson,
tu t'es fait comprendre, ça va.
Ferme ta gueule et mate.
Et... un.
Allez ! Allez !
Miguel, assieds-toi.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
C'est bien ce que je me demande.
Parle-moi de ta relation
avec Wolfgang Cutler.
Cutler, le nazi ?
On n'avait pas de relation.
Cette tête d'œuf était raciste
à tous les niveaux.
Ça te surprendrait s'il t'avait légué
quelque chose dans son testament ?
Il m'a légué quelque chose ?
- Quoi, par exemple ?
- Tout ce qu'il possède.
Quoi ?
Tu es le seul bénéficiaire
de tous ses biens matériels,
à Oz et à l'extérieur.
Sa maison, sa voiture...
Sa moto lndian de 1942.
- Arrêtez les conneries.
- Signé et tamponné par un notaire.
Vous vous foutez de ma gueule ?
Je lui ai presque jamais parlé
à ce type.
Deux ou trois fois en répétition,
c'est tout.
Ce type n'avait pas
de femme, d'enfants,
- de famille, rien ?
- Une femme, pas d'enfants.
- Merde, c'est vraiment dingue.
- On a nettoyé sa cellule,
et on a mis tous ses biens
dans une boîte.
Il va falloir que tu décides
ce que tu veux garder.
Je ne vais pas fouiller
dans les affaires d'un mort.
Quand même.
Il va falloir qu'on attende l'au-delà
pour savoir pourquoi
Cutler a voulu donner tout ce qu'il
possédait à un putain de basané.
Hé, je suis aussi surpris que toi.
Je sais que vous avez passé
beaucoup de temps avec Cutler.
Il a mentionné quelque chose
à mon sujet ?
Oui, dans son sommeil la nuit.
Il murmurait ton nom.
- Va te faire foutre !
- Alvarez, je te suggère une chose
ou je me débrouillerai
pour que ça arrive plus tard :
Tu donnes tout à sa femme.
- J'y ai déjà pensé.
- Ne pense pas bougnoule, agis.
C'est peut-être à toi que je devrais
donner tous ses biens, Roby.
Puisque tu lui as déjà donné
ton cul.
Connard.
Je t'ai manqué ?
Toi, tu m'as manqué.
Qu'est-ce qui t'es arrivé,
ces derniers mois ?
J'ai passé une période
un peu difficile.
Mais maintenant,
je suis de nouveau sur pied.
Merde, Leez, tu es belle.
Branle-moi.
- Calme-toi, qu'est-ce qui te prend ?
- Lâche moi !
- Assieds-toi maintenant !
- Lâche-moi, tapette !
- Tu m'as traité de quoi ?
- Tapette !
Ne me dis plus jamais ça, jamais !
- Qu'est-ce que tu as ?
- Je ne suis pas pédé !
Merde !
Merde !
a été assassiné à OZ
est mort d'overdose à OZ
Je suis dans un restaurant chinois.
Mon biscuit de fortune me dit :
"Qui choisit la revanche
- doit creuser deux tombes".
- Je déteste la cuisine chinoise.
- Ta gueule, Hank.
- Ta gueule, Hank.
Mon frère est un sale petit con,
mais je lui pardonne.
Pourquoi ? Parce qu'on n'a
que deux solutions :
Pardonner,
ou mourir de mort lente.
Dans une de ces études
que font les médecins,
il est prouvé qu'être rempli
de colère et d'amertume
peut représenter un risque
de maladie mentale,
de dépression et d'angoisse,
d'infarctus, de maladies du cœur
et de crises cardiaques.
Qui l'eût cru ?
Pardonner est bon pour la santé.
Écoutez tous, s'il vous plaît.
Écoutez-moi, s'il vous plaît.
Quand Augustus Hill est mort,
nous avons pensé l'avoir perdu
pour toujours, mais c'était faux.
Il a écrit un livre
qui parle de sa vie ici...
Qui parle de vos vies...
Et le dernier grand geste
de Kareem Said
a été de faire publier
le livre d'Augustus.
Quand Kareem est mort,
Le livre aurait pu mourir avec lui,
mais il n'est pas mort
grâce au travail et au dévouement
de ces hommes.
Je veux que vous partagiez
tous leur triomphe.
Voilà.
Merde, ça suffit.
- Arrête de me faire chier !
- Calme-toi, Rawls.
Tu as une idée du coût
de cette machine ?
Non. Il y a un truc
qui cloche.
Ne la touche pas,
je vais chercher Arif.
Il y a du grabuge.
Un des types a des problèmes,
et je ne peux pas l'aider.
Tu devrais prendre quelques
minutes pour aller y jeter un œil.
Je n'ai pas quelques minutes, Jamal.
Tu ne vois pas ?
Et si on engageait quelqu'un
de l'extérieur pour la comptabilité ?
Et on les paierait avec quoi ?
Tu vois ce chiffre en bas, à droite ?
C'est notre bénéfice actuel.
Un cinquième de ce qu'il devait être.
Avec tout le respect
que je dois à Kareem Said,
s'occuper du livre de Hill gratuitement
n'était pas une idée rentable.
C'est le fait qu'on paie les gens
au SMlC qui est le problème.
Une réduction de salaire serait
peut-être la meilleure solution,
tout en restant au-dessus
du salaire moyen des prisonniers.
Et détruire l'objectif même
de cette opération ? Non.
Quel est l'objectif exactement ?
Faire réussir l'entreprise
ou humilier Burr Redding ?
Prisonnier No 01R934,
Reginald Rawls...
Condamné le 10 Janvier 2001
pour coups et blessures.
Verdict : 12 ans, liberté conditionnelle
dans quatre ans.
D'abord, la vente à distance,
maintenant la reliure de livres ?
Ce n'est pas le genre de prison
dont on entend parler dans la rue.
Bon, on arrête de jouer.
Je veux que vous reveniez
dans l'entreprise de Degenhart.
C'est le poète
qui vous a convaincu
à le suivre pour travailler
avec les Musulmans.
Au cas où vous ayez oublié,
vous êtes sous mes ordres.
Ah bon ?
Kenaniah, on obéit encore
à Mr Redding ?
Vous m'avez supplié comme des
salopes pour joindre mon clan.
Je vous ai donné un refuge.
Je vous ai appris les ficelles.
Et c'est comme ça
que vous me remerciez.
S'il te plaît.
On était ton infanterie.
On vendait la came jour et nuit.
Maintenant tu changes d'avis
et tu veux
qu'on travaille pour de bon ?
Va te faire voir, vieux.
- Fais ton discours, Reggie.
- T'as raison, négro.
Fais voir.
Tu voulais me voir, Redding.
À propos de quoi ?
Quand je t'ai dit que j'allais abandonner
le trafic de came,
- Tu ne m'as pas cru.
- Non, on t'a pas cru.
Tu vois maintenant
que je disais vrai.
Je me suis impliqué dans ce
commerce de vente à distance
pour empêcher mes gars
de dealer...
Mais ça ne marche pas,
et j'ai besoin d'aide.
Si vous voyez Poet, Rawls
ou les autres
en train de dealer, je veux
qu'ils soient anéantis.
- Complètement.
- Tu veux qu'on tue tes gars ?
Pas les tuer, les immobiliser.
Les affaiblir jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient
obligés de revenir vers moi.
Je crois que c'est entendu.
J'en ai assez de trimbaler et
de soulever des machines lourdes.
Il faut qu'on revienne
à la vente de came.
Je suis d'accord, Reggie,
mais c'est pas le moment.
J'aimerais bien
le faire tomber, ce gino.
Tu y arriveras, mais pas encore.
Il faut qu'on le fasse
tout en douceur.
Hé, les gars.
- On se fait des passes ?
- Va crever, Omar.
Prisonnier No 03I462,
Lemuel Idzik...
Condamné le 2 Février 2003
pour meurtre au second degré.
Verdict : prison à vie,
aucune possibilité
de liberté conditionnelle.
Vous allez rester ici
au Bloc J temporairement,
pour qu'on voit comment le reste
des détenus s'adapte à vous.
Voici votre nid.
C'est bon de vous voir,
gardien.
Je suis Alvin Yood.
T'es du genre chaleureux, toi.
Arif,
je viens d'apprendre que le salaud
qui a tué Said va venir à Oz.
- Il est déjà ici.
- Ici ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
- Faire ?
- Oui, qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
- Il faut le démolir, ce cul blanc.
- Non !
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Arif,
t'as pas de couilles ?
J'ai promis au gardien qu'aucun mal
ne sera fait à Idzik,
et qu'aucun musulman
ne chercherait à se venger.
C'est bien ce que je dis,
pas de couilles.
Écoute-moi.
J'ai vu Kareem Said
se faire descendre.
Il est mort dans mes bras.
Les derniers mots
qu'il a prononcés étaient :
"Ne lui fais pas de mal".
Aussi difficile que ce soit
de ne rien faire,
je respecterai et j'obéirai
aux vœux de notre prêcheur.
Et tu feras la même chose.
Me donne pas d'ordres, connard.
Je ne suis pas ta chose
tu comprends ?
Je ne t'appartiens absolument pas.
Courrier !
- Il est comment, le nouveau ?
- Il parle tout le temps.
La Fraternité t'est reconnaissante
pour ce que tu as fait à Said.
Si ces salauds de musulmans
te cherchent des noises,
tu me le dis et on s'en charge.
- Je suis Juif.
- Juif ?
J'ai toujours dit que les Juifs pouvaient
servir à quelque chose.
Alors explique-moi :
Pourquoi tu l'as buté ?
Un truc israélo-palestinien ?
De l'eau.
De l'eau froide.
Hein ?
Tu mets de l'eau froide
dans une théière par exemple.
Tu allumes la cuisinière,
et l'eau chauffe, non ?
À un moment donné, elle atteint
sa température maximale.
Elle est brûlante. Une fois
que la cuisinière est éteinte,
L'eau commence à refroidir.
Finalement elle redevient froide.
C'est comme ça que les choses
fonctionnent dans l'univers.
Froid, chaud, froid.
Tu aurais dû plaider la folie.
Omar, tu voulais me voir ?
Oui, monsieur.
Je demande officiellement
par la présente
une rencontre en face à face
avec Lemuel Idzik.
Ce sera non.
- Attendez, écoutez moi.
- Il a tué Said.
Je ne vais pas te donner une chance
de lui renvoyer l'ascenseur.
- Je ne lui ferai pas de mal.
- Tu dis ça maintenant,
mais que tu diras-tu quand
tu seras debout sur son cadavre
avec une lame dans la main.
Pas question.
Merde !
La Voie Lactée
Observatoire Dunbar
Si pardonner
est si bon pour nous,
- pourquoi ne pas le faire plus ?
- C'est comme le tofu. J'en mange pas,
- parce que c'est dégueulasse.
- On se retient pour deux raisons.
D'abord, la responsabilité.
Tant qu'on souffre, on a besoin
d'en vouloir à quelqu'un.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait de la souffrance
si on a laissé filer le salaud ?
Deuxièmement, l'identité.
Sans cette rage qui me consume,
sans cette rancœur
et cette amertume,
qui suis-je ?
Et le dîner de récompenses
et le banquet annuel
de l'Association des Gardiens
Pénitentiaires se tiendra ce mois-ci.
Pourquoi on doit toujours héberger
ce genre de conneries ?
Ce genre d'attitude, Claire,
est la raison pour laquelle
une fois de plus, vous ne ramènerez
pas de trophée à la maison.
N'oubliez pas,
c'est tenue de soirée.
Donnons bonne impression.
C'est tout pour aujourd'hui.
Je ne peux pas porter de robe
de soirée, je n'en ai pas.
- Je peux vous voir une minute ?
- Bien sûr.
Je suis gardien
depuis très longtemps,
et pendant toutes ces années,
j'ai fait des choses que je regrette.
On a tous des regrets, Sean.
Les risques du métier.
Ce que je veux dire c'est qu'on passe
beaucoup de temps
à essayer de faire
cafarder les prisonniers,
mais entre nous,
il y a un espèce de...
- Code du silence
- Que tu apprêtes à briser.
Oui.
Je n'aimerais pas être à ta place.
- Qui ?
- Dave Brass.
- Il a tué Carlos Martinez ?
- Non, non.
Mais Dave a menti quand il a dit que
Martinez avait parlé le soir de sa mort.
Il n'y a pas eu de confession
sur un lit de mort.
Martinez n'a jamais dit que Morales
avait coupé les tendons de Dave.
C'est pour ça que tu m'as demandé
de transférer Morales à l'hôpital.
- Je crois toujours ce crétin coupable.
- Il n'y a pas de preuves.
On l'a injustement
mis en cellule d'isolement.
Pire...
Dave, Claire, Howell et moi, on...
C'est nous qui avons coupé
les chevilles de Morales.
Je soupçonnais
que Brass était impliqué,
et que Howell l'avait laissé faire.
- Mais toi, Sean...
- Dave était mon pote.
Morales a détruit sa vie.
D'accord. Merci.
"Merci", c'est tout ?
Je vais vous mettre à l'amende
tous les trois, mais...
Je ne sais pas encore comment,
exactement.
- Sean ?
- Oui ?
Il faut avoir du courage
pour faire ce que tu viens de faire.
Je ne suis pas devenu
gardien de zoo
pour me comporter
comme les animaux.
Mets-le dans ta bouche.
Morales.
Je te relâche de ta cellule d'isolement
de manière permanente.
Je te renvoie à Emerald City.
- Pourquoi ?
- Il me faut une raison ?
Ça risquerait de me faire
réfléchir à deux fois.
D'accord, oubliez le pourquoi.
Gardien, qu'est-ce que vous savez
sur l'infirmière Grace ?
Ce que je sais sur elle ? Rien.
Elle travaille ici depuis des années.
Si j'étais vous, je vérifierais
ses antécédents.
Quoi ? Elle n'est pas compétente,
médicalement ?
J'ai peur d'elle.
Peur ? Toi ?
- Tu as peur d'elle ?
- Oui.
Ça doit être tes médicaments.
Hé, Rebadow.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Je t'ai donné tout l'argent
qui restait de cette loterie, non ?
Trop tard pour sauver mon petit-fils.
Tu me crois coupable,
mais tu ne devrais pas.
- Qui c'est, alors ?
- Morales.
Il a chargé Martinez de me tailler,
Ça m'a perturbé,
et je suis parti avec tes gains.
C'est lui, le salaud
que tu devrais détester.
J'ai de la place dans mon cœur
pour vous deux.
Ah oui ?
Eh bien,
Morales revient à Em City,
et moi, j'ai eu une amende
et je suis suspendu de mes fonctions
pendant un mois entier.
Pas de salaire, pas d'avantages.
Tu crois que j'en ai les moyens ?
Je viens juste
de me marier, bon Dieu !
Je répète ma question.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Que je sois désolé pour vous ?
Aucune chance.
Va te faire foutre, Murphy.
Alors, t'es content ?
Brass s'est fait tanner le cul,
on perd une semaine de vacances.
Tout ça pour quoi ? Ce connard
d'Enrique Morales ?
Pour la vérité, Howell.
Pour la justice.
La justice ?
Mon cul, oui !
Appelez la réserve de sang,
voilà un autre cœur qui saigne.
- Leo m'a raconté les détails.
- Je suis désolé, Tim.
- Tu es désolé ?
- Je te fais entrer à Oz
parce qu'on se connaît
depuis l'école primaire,
parce que tu es la seule personne
que je connaisse
en qui je peux avoir confiance,
à qui je confierais ma vie
s'il le fallait.
Et voilà, je découvre que je ne peux
pas te faire confiance.
Tu n'es qu'une autre tête dure,
une larve, un gros beauf qui utilise
son badge comme une arme.
Tu as raison,
tu as absolument raison.
Ne t'avise pas d'être d'accord
avec moi !
Je te dis d'aller te faire mettre !
Écoute, j'ai trahi ta confiance.
Si tu penses que tu ne pourras plus
me faire confiance,
- je devrais demander mon transfert.
- Quoi ?
Je devrais peut-être démissionner,
carrément.
Non. C'est pas vrai !
Arrête avec tes putains de remords !
- Tu ne veux pas que j'aie des remords ?
- Non... si !
On va dîner ensemble ce soir.
Tu m'invites.
D'accord.
Sean, je suis fier de toi.
Fier que tu te sois manifesté.
Ça veut dire... que je peux encore
te faire confiance.
Morales ?
Morales,
je suis désolé de te déranger.
Il était fort, le sédatif
que je t'ai donné, hein ?
Oui.
C'est par précaution.
Tu es un costaud. Je ne voulais pas
avoir à me battre.
Me battre ?
Martinez était tellement faible
qu'il ne pouvait pas se battre,
mais toi...
Fais ta prière, Enrique.
- Non, ne faites pas ça.
- Tu es comme Martinez.
Un être affreux
qui mérite de mourir.
- Toc toc.
- Bonjour.
Tu peux dire : "qui est là ?"
ça va prendre du temps avant
qu'elle dise : "Agamemnon Busmalis".
Mon Dieu.
Elle est magnifique.
Merci.
Cette odeur fraîche
de peau de bébé...
dans un endroit comme Oz,
c'est insolite.
- Je peux la prendre ?
- Bien sûr.
- Je peux la garder ?
- Et si on partageait ?
Ruby a besoin d'un père,
Agamemnon.
J'ai besoin que tu reviennes.
Agamemnon,
tu veux m'épouser ?
Quoi ?
Tu me fais une demande
en mariage ?
- Ça veut dire oui ?
- Je crois, oui.
Oui.
- Mon Dieu, oui !
- Oui.
Oui !
Ma petite poupée.
Je ne peux plus travailler
à la bibliothèque.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Je ne préfère pas entrer
dans les détails.
Vu que c'est moi qui commande ici,
j'ai besoin de détails.
Quelque chose s'est passé ?
- Non.
- Un problème avec d'autres détenus ?
- Non.
- C'est Stella ?
Vous avez des problèmes ?
- Non.
- Mais alors, quoi ?
Tu as oublié ton alphabet ?
Je ne veux pas mettre
Robert dans le pétrin,
mais j'ai pensé
que tu devrais être au courant.
Rebadow n'est pas du genre
à disparaître comme ça.
Cela dit, il est venu me voir
pour demander un autre travail.
Tu as une idée de ses raisons ?
Non.
Il doit encore être déprimé
à propos d'Alex Jr.
Qui ?
Son petit-fils.
Il est mort l'an dernier
d'une leucémie.
Son petit-fils ?
D'une leucémie ?
Je ne t'ai rien dit quand je suis
venu te voir, au début.
J'ai pensé que la bibliothèque
serait un bon endroit
pour occuper son esprit
et le distraire de sa souffrance.
Enfin, il sera là demain.
Alors j'ai bien joué d'après toi
avec "La Quatrième balle" ?
- J'ai marqué un but ?
- J'aime bien le tir du castor.
Les joueurs qui creusent des trous
dans les portes de la chambre d'hôtel
pour regarder l'hôtesse de l'air
se faire troncher.
Oui, c'est marrant pour les gars,
mais tu aurais été content
si tu avais été de l'autre côté ?
Ce qu'ils ont fait était
une atteinte à la vie privé.
- Peu importe.
- Peu importe.
Voici un bon livre sur les femmes.
Et j'ai pensé que ce livre
sur la nature sauvage
serait une bonne antidote
contre Oz : "Tragédie à l'Everest".
- J'ai l'air d'un putain de scout ?
- D'un scout, non.
Mais d'un petit garçon, oui.
Je reviens dans une minute.
J'aimerais te parler.
Quand je t'ai parlé
de mon cancer du sein,
je ne te demandais pas de me regarder
me ruiner et mourir, Robert.
Je n'ai pas besoin de toi pour ça,
si c'est de ça dont tu as peur.
Je suis au courant pour Alex Jr.
Il ne s'agit pas de ça.
Je sais bien ce que tu penses...
Tu ne veux plus souffrir.
Et si tu rates une chance
d'être heureux ?
Le bonheur d'être là pour quelqu'un
qui va s'en sortir ?
D'après Blake, le bonheur
et le chagrin vont de pair :
"Ils se taisent dans les vallées sauvages".
Tu te souviens ?
Arrête de déconner.
Si elle te parle, vieux,
tu la respectes et tu réponds.
Ça suffit, Pablo. Prends ton bouquin,
on a fini pour aujourd'hui.
70 fois 77.
Jésus a dit qu'on devait
pardonner à son frère 70 fois 77.
Hank et moi, on a
déjà du mal avec sept.
Pendant ce temps-là, un homme
innocent cloué sur une croix,
portant une couronne d'épines,
dit alors qu'il meurt :
"Pardonne-les, mon père.
Ils ne savent pas ce qu'ils font".
Ça place la barre assez haut
pour nous tous, non ?
L'agent Schwartzmyer dit que la nuit
du meurtre, tu t'es mis à hurler.
J'ai eu une mauvaise réaction
aux médicaments.
Pendant qu'il est venu te voir,
quelqu'un s'est glissé dans la chambre
et a poignardé le maire Loewen.
Le médicament m'a donné
de l'urticaire.
Mr Kelsch, le Dr Nathan nous a dit
que vous n'avez pas eu de réaction
allergique au médicament.
Ça n'arrêtait pas de me gratter.
Vous voulez savoir ce que je pense ?
Je pense qu'on vous a payé pour
distraire l'agent Schwartzmyer.
Les démangeaisons
me rendaient fou.
Ce qui vous rend
complice de meurtre.
Ça veut dire que vous êtes passible
de la peine de mort.
Hein ? La peine de mort ?
Pour de l'urticaire ?
D'accord, Brandt.
Voici ce qu'on va faire.
On sait que tu es coupable
du meurtre de Wilson Loewen.
- Vous mentez.
- On a les dépositions de deux détenus
qui étaient à l'infirmerie de soir-là.
Ils disent qu'ils t'ont vu
te lever du lit
- et entrer dans la chambre de Loewen.
- lls mentent.
Nous avons aussi
une confession de Lionel Kelsch.
Il dit que tu lui as offert mille dollars
pour distraire l'agent.
C'est un menteur.
Bon, fais comme tu veux.
Vous avez le droit
de garder le silence.
Les Aryens vont avoir les boules en
apprenant que tu as tué leur héros.
Tout ce que vous direz pourra être
utilisé contre vous dans un tribunal.
Sans ma protection,
tu seras mort dans l'heure.
Vous avez droit à un avocat
avant de me parler.
D'accord.
D'accord.
Je vais vous dire qui m'a engagé.
C'était ce gardien...
Comment il s'appelle ? Johnson.
Johnson, comment ça va ?
Pas mal monsieur, et vous ?
La routine.
J'ai entendu dire que tu venais
d'acheter une voiture.
Une Jaguar.
- Oui.
- C'est une voiture magnifique.
C'est cher pour un salaire de gardien.
Une tante célibataire de ma femme
a passé l'arme à gauche.
Elle nous a laissé un peu de thune.
Sympa.
Willy Brandt...
- Quoi, monsieur ?
- Willy Brandt a avoué
Le meurtre de Wilson Loewen.
Félicitations.
Comment êtes-vous arrivés
à le faire cracher ?
Tu veux savoir ?
On a menti.
On a dit à Brandt
qu'on avait deux témoins,
ce qui n'est pas vrai, et que son
partenaire avait avoué,
ce qui n'est pas vrai.
- Très malin.
- Mais le meilleur dans tout ça
c'est que Brandt prétend
que tu as proposé
de le payer 5000 dollars
pour buter Wilson Loewen.
Je ne le crois pas, bien sûr.
Non, bien sûr.
C'est un sale menteur.
C'est ça.
Bon, bonne nuit.
Profite bien de ta voiture.
C'est moi.
On a un problème.
Glynn sait que que j'ai organisé
le meurtre.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux
que je fasse ?
D'accord.
Ton fils a amené le diable ici.
Tu m'entends ?
Ton petit garçon s'est fait
enculer par Satan,
et maintenant on va tous brûler,
grosse salope !
Je suis une idiote.
J'ai cru qu'en parlant à l'homme
qui a tué Timmy, j'en apprendrais
plus sur mon garçon,
j'ai cru que je comprendrais
comment il est devenu ce qu'il est.
Comme je vous l'ai dit,
Jazz Hoyt n'est pas très cohérent
ces jours-ci.
La cour d'appel l'a déclaré fou.
Demain, ils le transfèrent
dans l'unité psychiatrique.
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
Comment apaiser ma culpabilité ?
Et ne me dites pas de prier.
J'ai tellement prié
que mes genoux me font mal.
Quand la prière échoue,
j'essaie en général d'imaginer
ce que mon père aurait fait
dans la même situation.
C'est une excellente idée.
Vous buvez, mon père ?
- Bien sûr.
- Bien.
Je vais aller nous chercher
une bouteille de whisky Jameson,
et on assiéra dans le noir
en buvant jusqu'à l'aube.
C'est comme ça
que mon père aurait réagi.
- Mme Kirk, je...
- Je plaisante, mon père.
Appelez-moi Jessica.
- Appelez-moi Ray.
- Ray...
Comme un rayon de soleil.
Je crois que
ce que je devrais faire...
C'est ce que j'aurais dû faire
quand Timmy était vivant,
c'est-à-dire faire
du bénévolat à Oswald.
Aider les gens comme mon fils
- à devenir des gens bien.
- Faire du bénévolat ?
- Vous feriez quoi ?
- Je suis infirmière.
Je suis sûre qu'ils ont besoin
d'aide à l'infirmerie.
Oui.
- Vous pouvez régler ça pour moi ?
- Bien sûr.
Merci.
Je vous considère
comme un très bon ami.
Bonjour, les petits.
Est-ce que je dois aller
faire plus de TEC ?
Plus tard.
Allez Hoyt, c'est l'heure
de ton transfert en unité psy.
Hoyt !
Merde !
Je saigne.
Il va dormir.
Je lui ai donné un sédatif.
Il n'a pas de plaie sur son front.
Pourquoi saigne-t-il ?
Un phénomène rare qu'on appelle
l'hématidrose.
On a de minuscules vaisseaux
sanguins sous la peau,
appelés capillaires.
Quand les gens sont angoissés,
ils transpirent, non ?
Parfois,
en cas d'angoisse extrême,
il se produit
une hémorragie des capillaires
qui libère un peu de sang
dans les glandes sudorales.
Hoyt sue du sang, littéralement.
"Étant à l'agonie,
il priait plus instamment,
et sa sueur devint comme
des grumeaux de sang,
qui tombaient à terre".
Luc, 22:44, l'agonie du Christ
à Gethsémané.
Je ne savais pas que Jésus
avait tant en commun avec Jaz.
Qu'est-ce qui lui arrive ?
Un effet secondaire
de l'électrochoc.
Je me suis vomi dessus.
Pauvre Cyril.
Nettoyez-le et faites-le entrer.
J'allais lui donner de l'Emetrol et le
renvoyer dans le couloir de la mort.
Il y a assez passé de temps,
un changement lui ferait du bien.
D'accord, mais je lui mets
une camisole.
Hé, Gloria. Merci beaucoup
d'avoir laissé mon frère
se reposer à l'infirmerie.
- J'apprécie beaucoup.
- Je t'en prie.
Oui. Au fait, nous...
On vient d'apprendre
que son dernier appel
a été refusé,
et l'avocate
va plaider son cas
auprès de la Cour Suprême.
Mais tu sais,
à moins d'un miracle...
Je crois que Cyril va être exécuté
la semaine prochaine.
Il faut que j'y aille.
Hé, Gloria...
Je n'ai jamais cessé de t'aimer,
pas une seconde.
Excusez-moi.
Excusez-moi.
Excusez-moi.
Ne m'ignore pas, putain.
Tu crois que je ne sais pas ce qui se
passe, parce que je suis un peu lent ?
Il faut que j'aille aux toilettes.
Ecoute moi bien, connard.
Je vais chier dans mon froque.
Aide-moi.
Trop tard.
Tu vas me laisser ici,
à baigner dans ma merde ?
Hé !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- J'ai eu un accident.
C'est pas vrai, encore.
Machelo.
Tu peux me donner un coup de main,
s'il te plaît ?
Me voila.
Quelle est l'urgence ?
Mr Neema,
votre réputation dans la rue
est énorme.
Déjà à l'époque
des Black Panthers,
et depuis avec le développement
de la communauté
- et...
- Je connais mon CV. Allez au but.
Voyez-vous, monsieur,
on se retrouve un peu sans chef
ces derniers temps.
Burr Redding est parti dans son trip
de vente à distance.
Et vous voulez
que je reprenne le flambeau.
Ouais.
Vous savez pourquoi je suis à Oz ?
Pour enlèvement,
un truc comme ça.
Je suis allé chercher
ma fille à la crèche.
Mon ex-femme voulait
partir à l'étranger
et me priver du droit
de voir mon enfant.
J'adore mes enfants, messieurs.
J'adore chacun d'entre eux,
et j'en ai 16.
Cette fois-ci, c'est à vous
d'aller droit au but.
Aucun de mes enfants ne se drogue,
aucun ne vend de la drogue,
ou ne traîne avec des gangs.
Ils vivent chacun la vie
qu'ils ont choisie,
et ils font de leur mieux
pour construire
un monde meilleur.
Mes enfants sont ma fierté
parce qu'ils me rendent fier.
Alors au lieu d'utiliser
cette salle de classe
pour faire vos magouilles,
faites quelque chose de bien avec :
Apprenez.
Fin du sermon.
Fin de la discussion.
Tiens, un revenant. Je ne t'ai pas
beaucoup vu récemment.
- Tu as été très prise avec la pièce...
- Oui.
- Ton petit copain.
- Petit copain ?
Jahfree Neema.
Je vous vois ensemble,
en train de rire, de murmurer.
- C'est très mignon, très intime.
- Ryan, arrête.
Quoi ? Tu vas me dire
que je me fais des films,
- que mes yeux me trompent ?
- Non.
Tu voulais que je sois sympa avec lui,
j'ai essayé, mais il m'a ignoré.
Je sais que tu le prends pour un type
important, un sauveur, tout ça,
mais pour moi c'est juste
un glandeur de plus.
Amusez-vous bien tous les deux.
Pendant ce temps,
mon frère va mourir.
- Ryan.
- Quoi ?
Promets-moi que tu ne feras
pas de mal à Jahfree.
Mon Dieu, maman...
Tu me crois vraiment
capable de ça ?
Neema,
On n'a pas vraiment eu l'occasion
de parler depuis que tu es ici.
C'est probablement
parce qu'on n'a rien à se dire.
Ecoute, je sais qu'en apparence,
toi et moi
- on n'a jamais été bons amis.
- Amis ?
Redding,
tu es l'anathème pour moi.
Tu vois, tu recommences
avec tes mots compliqués.
Tu crois que tu vas me faire plier,
mais ça ne marche pas.
Depuis trente ans,
tu as fourni aux enfants de notre
communauté des drogues mortelles
pendant que je me battais
pour protéger ces mêmes enfants.
Maintenant, sous prétexte qu'on se
retrouve ensemble dans ce trou rats,
tu veux croire qu'on est liés.
- C'est faux.
- C'est vrai !
Je me suis rendu compte
de mes erreurs,
et j'essaie de les corriger.
Je ne te crois pas.
Tu sais, Burr, ce Neema
c'est vraiment
un gros con prétentieux.
Moi je crois qu'il est temps
qu'il comprenne qui commande ici.
Tu veux le voir mort, O'Reily ?
Je ne pleurerais pas si ça arrivait.
Si tu veux vraiment faire
du mal à Neema,
fais en sorte qu'il soit lié
au crime de ta mère.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Tu es un garçon intelligent,
réfléchis un peu.
A qui est-ce qu'on a le plus
de mal à pardonner ?
A soi-même.
Les démons que tu as à l'intérieur
se marrent en y pensant.
Quand tu pardonnes
à un autre type,
il est peu probable qu'il te rejette
et te dise d'aller te faire foutre.
Mais quand on essaie
de se pardonner,
on se dit toujours
d'aller se faire foutre.
Même après dix ans, tu ne peux
toujours pas te laisser vivre.
quinze ans, vingt ans, quarante ans.
Tu vas emporter cette rancune
contre toi-même dans ta tombe ?
Tu vas la trimballer pour l'éternité ?
Eh bien, agent Taylor,
- vous venez me voir ?
- Va chier, Keller.
Dis donc mon grand,
pas la peine d'être grincheux.
C'est toi qui as fait le deal avec
Heekin. Tu lui as dit de mentir.
Il t'a vu jeter le corps.
C'est J. Edgar Hoover qui a dit :
"Ceux qui trichent ne prospèrent pas" ?
Faites attention.
Tu as tué deux autres hommes,
Keller.
Et je vais t'épingler
pour l'un d'entre eux.
Henry Stanton ?
Je m'appelle Tobias Beecher.
Sœur Peter Marie m'a suggéré
de venir vous voir.
C'est vous qui faites du bénévolat ?
- C'est ça.
- Vous aidez les détenus avec le droit.
Je me suis fait mal au dos en corvée
sanitaire il y a quelques mois.
Le Dr Nathan m'a dit
de ne pas faire trop d'efforts.
Je l'ai dit au gardien et ils m'ont
tout de suite remis au travail.
Ils pensent que je fais semblant,
mais c'est faux.
Ils me font même travailler plus dur.
Je me plains à mon directeur de bloc,
mais rien ne change. Et l'autre jour,
je me suis encore fait mal au dos.
A première vue,
on dirait que le gardien
a porté atteinte à vos droits
d'après le huitième amendement :
non assistance à personne en danger.
Je vais aller parler au Dr Nathan,
aux policiers impliqués
et à Warden Glynn.
Je verrai ce que je peux faire.
En attendant, reposez-vous.
Le mal de dos, c'est horrible.
Merci beaucoup, mon pote.
Stanton ne ment pas, Leo.
Je lui ai fourni les papiers médicaux
au moins trois fois.
D'accord, les gardiens se sont plantés.
Ils seront réprimandés.
Ce n'est pas assez.
J'ai un cas solide
comme le roc, Warden.
- Si on va au tribunal, on gagne.
- Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
La remise en forme complète
de Stanton aux frais de la prison,
et une garantie qu'on lui donnera
des tâches plus faciles.
- D'accord.
- Et je veux ces deux agents virés.
- Beecher.
- Qu'ils partent aujourd'hui.
- Le syndicat va se battre.
- Laissez-les porter le blâme.
C'est bon, ils sont virés.
Je n'ai pas que ça à faire.
- Tu es doué pour ce genre de choses.
- Tu n'as encore rien vu.
Comment tu te fais à la vie
après le couloir de la mort ?
Je m'ennuie.
Le quotidien m'ennuie,
se raser, se brosser les dents,
aller chier, m'essuyer le cul.
Si tu veux mon avis,
je ne crois pas que tu t'ennuies.
Je crois que Tobias te manque.
Il est devenu le point de mire.
Il avait à peine fini de contester
mon verdict
qu'il était déjà à s'occuper
du cas d'un autre gars.
Il a trouvé le bonheur
en aidant les autres.
Tu devrais essayer de faire pareil.
Et comment pourrais-je faire ça,
ma sœur ? Je ne suis pas avocat.
Eh bien...
Qui aimes-tu, à part Beecher ?
Mes ex-femmes, j'imagine.
Commence par là.
Vous venez de me donner
une super idée, ma sœur.
Merci.
- Mes chaussettes.
- Oui, je te connais.
Tu les portes jusqu'à
ce qu'elles soient en lambeaux.
C'est exact.
Quoi de neuf,
dans le monde extérieur ?
Les gamins se portent bien,
Harry
m'a pris dans ses bras hier.
C'est mignon.
J'aimerais rencontrer tes gamins.
- C'est ça.
- Je ne plaisante pas.
Bon, d'accord.
Bien sûr.
Mais pas tout de suite.
Tu as bu ces derniers temps ?
Pas une goutte.
Je suis allé à un cocktail l'autre soir
et j'ai passé le test, haut la main.
C'est bien mon garçon. Et la prof
de Holly, elle est comment ?
Pourquoi me demandes-tu ça ?
Je ne sais pas, c'est toi
qui en as parlé plusieurs fois.
Tu sais, en fait,
- pour être franc, Chris...
- Oui !
Soyons francs.
On sort ensemble, Marian et moi.
Tu la baises déjà ?
- Chris.
- Sois franc.
Oui.
Je suis content pour toi,
sale beau gosse.
Tu as les boules.
Non.
Sois franc.
Tu veux un moment de vérité ?
- J'ai tué Franklin Winthrop.
- Quoi ?
Cette salope a tué ton père.
Il devait mourir.
Tu veux qu'on te renvoie
dans le couloir de la mort ?
J'ai brouillé les pistes.
- Merde.
- Ecoute, Toby.
Je te le dis...
Je ne me vante pas.
Je n'essaie pas de te perturber.
Je te le dis parce que j'ai besoin
que tu me rendes un service.
Mon ex-femme, Bonnie.
Elle vient d'apprendre qu'elle a
un cancer des ovaires.
Elle va mourir, Toby.
Le seul espoir qu'elle a
c'est un médicament
qui s'appelle oxaliplatin.
Le problème c'est que c'est illégal
dans ce pays.
Alors j'ai pris contact
avec un type que je connais,
qui trafique ce genre
de médicament illégal.
J'ai juste besoin
que tu le rencontres,
et que tu apportes
l'oxaliplatin à Bonnie.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Pourquoi, putain ?
Ce serait violer
ma liberté conditionnelle.
N'importe quoi, je te demande
de porter un petit paquet
dans ta poche d'un point A
à un point B.
Je ne peux pas.
Bonnie va mourir.
- Chris...
- Je t'aime.
- Ne fais pas ça.
- Je sais que tu m'aimes.
Je t'en supplie.
Toby, je t'en supplie.
D'accord. Donne-moi l'adresse.
Il faut que j'y aille.
Tu verras Toby, tu fais
quelque chose de bien.
Tu fais quelque chose
de bien, Toby.
Oui, l'inspecteur Weber est-il là ?
J'ai un renseignement pour lui.
Vente de médicaments illégaux.
Un homme se tient
dans un cimetière,
Iisant une lettre qu'il a écrite,
pardonnant enfin à son père mort.
La mère d'une fille
tuée par un chauffard ivre
est dévastée
par des fantasmes de revanche.
Ton petit copain te supplie
de lui donner encore une chance.
Tu te dis devant la glace
que tu ne te détestes plus.
Mais tu sais que ce n'est pas vrai.
Peut-être qu'au lieu
de pardonner et oublier,
on devrait pardonner
et se souvenir.
Se souvenir qu'on peut
se lever le lendemain
et devoir recommencer à pardonner.
Encore et encore.
Tout comme le cœur continue
à battre comme un tambour.
Pardonner.
Je ne peux pas.
Mais si, tu peux.
Pardonner.
Pardonner.
Je ne peux pas.
Tu peux.
Pardonner.
C'est toujours la même histoire.
Je me suis fait enculer.
Asseyez-vous.
Asseyez-vous, bordel.
Bon les gars, bienvenue à Oz.
Voici comment ça se passe.
La Sainte Bible
Mon Combat
C'est un fait :
2,5 millions de gens meurent
aux Etats-Unis
chaque année.
Bien sûr, selon la définition
du dictionnaire de "mort".
Etiqueté à l'orteil
et mis dans un sac.
La cause de décès n° 1 en Amérique :
les maladies de cœur.
Mais elles ne tuent pas
toutes au sens du dictionnaire.
Certaines vous tuent
et vous laissent vivant.
Oui, on a beaucoup
de morts-vivants à Oz.
Toby, te voilà.
Je te cherchais partout.
Fous le camp.
J'ai entendu
ce que tu racontes.
Tu penses que je te trahirais
pour te faire revenir ?
Ne joue pas le chiot blessé,
je sais qui tu es.
Toby, je t'aime.
J'ai besoin de toi.
Tu ne fais
qu'empirer les choses.
Tu dois me croire,
je suis innocent.
D'accord.
Disons que je te donne
le bénéfice du doute.
Disons que
tu n'as pas fait ça exprès.
Au fond, je crois
que tu aurais pu le faire,
que tu en es capable.
C'est le genre d'homme
que tu es
et je regrette de ne pas t'avoir laissé
dans le couloir mort.
Comment ça va, Chris ?
Va-t'en.
Je comprends
que tu es un peu irritable.
J'ai entendu ce qui
s'est passé à la gym.
Ça fend le cœur.
Je survivrai.
Je le sais.
Tu survis toujours.
Je me souviens quand
on était prisonniers à Lardner.
Mon Dieu, tu avais...
quoi, 17 ans ?
Tu es entré
dans le bloc des cellules
en te pavanant, vraiment.
J'ai dit : "Voilà un sacré
petit salopard".
C'est quoi ça, Vern ?
C'est quoi cette course
aux souvenirs ?
Je me rappelais
comme nous étions proches.
Tu me protégeais.
Je te suçais la bite. C'était tout.
Je ne t'aimais pas.
Je ne t'aimais pas non plus.
Mais admets
que ce qu'il y avait
entre nous,
c'était plus que rien.
Et alors ? Trop de merdes
nous sont arrivées depuis Lardner.
Ouais, à cause de Beecher.
Maintenant qu'il a fini,
soyons amis de nouveau.
Pas de bites à sucer.
Juste deux gars qui s'entraident.
Qu'est-ce que tu en penses ?
D'accord.
Brûlé vif à Oz
Le cancer.
Le putain de mot,
le plus effrayant qui existe
et la 2ème cause de décès.
C'est un signe du zodiaque
mais plus probablement
Le cancer dévore
vos organes internes.
Vous savez pourquoi
c'est si effrayant ?
Parce que le mot lui-même
est un cancer.
Rien que l'idée
peut rendre malade.
Le stress qu'il cause
peut se répandre dans l'esprit.
La peur peut tourner
en maladie.
Hé, Rebadow, par ici.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, Pablo ?
Je veux savoir quel est
ton putain de problème.
Pourquoi tu traites
Mlle C. comme une salope ?
- Ce n'est pas une salope.
- C'est ça, elle est gentille.
Elle m'aide
à faire mon temps
et tu la déprime.
Et le cancer ?
Ce n'est pas si grave.
Oui, elle me l'a dit hier.
Elle avait besoin de parler
parce que tu te comportais
comme ma conne de petite sœur.
Maria a eu la trouille
quand ma mère a eu le cancer.
Evidemment, elle avait 8 ans.
Et mi madre ?
Elle a écrasé cette maladie
comme si c'était un cafard.
Je pense que tu peux
t'identifier à ça.
Stella...
vous pourriez
vous asseoir un instant ?
J'ai souvent été confronté
à la mort dans ma vie.
Comme nous tous.
Mais pour moi, cet endroit
n'a jamais été plus une prison
que lorsque Alex Jr.
était mourant.
Je ne suis pas mourante,
Robert.
Vous n'en êtes pas sûre.
J'en suis drôlement
plus sûre que vous.
Vous devriez apprendre
à mieux vous excuser.
Ce que vous avez dit,
c'est nul.
J'ai été insensible, égocentrique.
Je suis désolé.
Je ne pouvais pas supporter
l'idée de perdre quelqu'un d'autre,
quelqu'un que j'aime.
Vous ne m'aimez pas,
Robert.
Si.
Et je promets
d'être là pour vous.
Je ne veux pas
que vous soyez là.
Je suis contente que
vous compreniez ce que je traverse
mais vos soucis,
vos préoccupations
ne se dissipent pas simplement
parce que vous les avouez.
L'ablation de ma tumeur
est dans quelques jours.
J'apprécie
vos sentiments pour moi
mais, en ce moment,
je ne veux pas de votre compagnie.
Oui.
Vous avez raison,
bien sûr.
Mais laissez-moi vous dire
une chose avant de partir.
Tu es dingue ou quoi ?
Demander un transfert
en régime normal ?
Surtout à Emerald City.
Said vivait là.
Les gars l'aimaient bien là-bas.
Pas tout le monde.
Je te le dis, ldzik,
c'est du suicide.
La pire des choses
quand on est en prison,
Le facteur que je n'ai pas pris
en considération...
c'est qu'on est enfermés si tôt
que je ne vois jamais
le ciel, la nuit.
J'avais l'habitude
d'aller au planétarium
tous les soirs.
Je regardais
dans le télescope
et je scrutais l'univers
à la recherche d'un signe.
La Voie Lactée
Mais il n'y en a jamais eu.
Tout est si silencieux là-bas.
Je n'ai même pas vu
d'étoile filante.
Vous êtes gonflé !
Amener ce salopard
à Em City.
Omar, à Em City,
il n'y a que des salopards,
y compris vous !
Compte tenu de tout
ce que vous avez fait,
en commençant par le meurtre
prémédité de Felicia Brown,
je ne vois pas pourquoi
vous faites le vertueux.
McManus, ce type a tué Said.
D'accord, je reconnais
que vous et le ministre
ne vous entendiez pas toujours.
C'est vrai, mais nous nous respections
la plupart du temps.
C'est une insulte à la mémoire
de Kareem de l'amener ici.
Il y a quelques jours, vous m'avez prié
de vous laisser le voir.
Oui, le voir mais pas devoir respirer
le même air pourri que lui
- continuellement et merde, Bon Dieu !
- Omar !
Je veux que vous me promettiez
qu'il ne sera pas fait de mal à ldzik.
- Jurez-le moi.
- Non !
Ne me donnez pas de raison de vous
foutre en cellule pour toujours !
D'accord, d'accord.
Je ne ferai pas
de mal à ldzik.
Bien. Maintenant, je veux
que vous le rencontriez.
Hein ?
Lemuel ldzik,
Omar White.
Omar sera votre sponsor.
McManus nous a mis ensemble
pour me niquer la tête
et peut-être la tienne aussi.
Pourquoi il ferait ça ?
Il veut me foutre
en cellule de nouveau.
Alors, il nous a collés
ensemble, mec, tu sais
en sachant
qu'on va se disputer.
Nous deux ?
Pourquoi ?
Parce... que je veux
te buter, mec
parce que tu as buté Said.
Ah, je vois...
parfait.
Avec le temps qui s'égrène,
Les mains du destin
applaudissent.
Ça veut dire quoi, ça, putain ?
J'ai demandé à venir
à Em City
pour une raison,
une seule raison.
Ouais, c'est quoi ?
Pour trouver quelqu'un
qui me tue.
Détective Tarnowski.
M. Le Directeur, enchanté.
Que puis-je faire
pour vous ?
Je suis des Homicides,
je remplace le Détective McGorry
sur l'affaire Wilson Loewen.
Vous remplacez McGorry,
pourquoi ?
Elle a été mutée,
ça arrive tout le temps.
Pas au milieu
d'une affaire importante.
Une affaire importante,
qui, en tout état de cause, est bouclée.
Allons dans mon bureau.
Willy Brandt a avoué le meurtre,
que voulez-vous de plus ?
Il n'avait pas d'autre motif
que l'argent.
Il a avoué avoir été payé
par l'Officier, Adrian Johnson.
Vous l'avez déjà interrogé ?
Pas formellement
mais je lui ai parlé
et il est coupable.
Je veux trouver pourquoi
Johnson l'a payé.
Voyons, M. Le Directeur,
pour des raisons raciales.
Loewen était impliqué dans le meurtre
de 2 petites noires dans les années 60.
Ça rendrait n'importe quel
homme furieux.
McGorry pensait
qu'il y avait autre chose.
Vous n'avez pas lu
son rapport ?
Bien sûr,
entre quatre murs,
mon lieutenant veut
que j'embarque vite ce salaud
et c'est ce que j'ai
l'intention de faire.
- Alors, trouvons cet Officier...
- Johnson.
et finissons-en.
C'est par où ?
Vous connaissez un prisonnier
du nom de William Brandt ?
Je sais qui c'est.
Je ne le connais pas personnellement.
Vous n'avez jamais eu
de contact avec lui ?
Peut-être une fois ou deux.
Vous savez comme c'est ici.
- Et Lionel Kelsch ?
- Pareil.
Avez-vous rencontré
le Maire Wilson Loewen,
- avant ou après son incarcération ?
- Non.
- Où étiez-vous le soir de sa mort ?
- Au lit avec ma femme.
Très bien, Officier,
merci beaucoup.
Je retourne travailler.
Ça n'a rien
d'un interrogatoire détaillé.
Vous avez un problème
avec ce gars, M. Le Directeur ?
Non. Jusqu'ici, je le considérais
un de mes meilleurs officiers.
Pourquoi vous fiez-vous
à la parole d'un criminel
plutôt qu'à la sienne ?
A mon avis,
Johnson est innocent.
Bonjour, Leo.
Merci d'être venu, Perry.
Asseyez-vous.
Je commence juste
à utiliser l'internet
et à vraiment
voir son potentiel.
Leo, il a dit
que c'était urgent.
Je suis un type occupé.
Je sais que vous l'êtes.
S'occuper du Gouverneur,
c'est un sacré boulot.
Evidemment,
Devlin a beaucoup besoin d'aide.
Mais vous avez été formidable,
à arranger ses gaffes,
ses indiscrétions.
De qui s'agit-il ?
Eh bien...
J'examinais le dossier
de l'Officier Adrian Johnson.
J'ai remarqué qu'il est allé
à Middlesex Academy.
Par curiosité,
j'ai cherché la liste
des anciens élèves.
Vous et lui étiez
de la même promotion ?
En fait, il avait
trois ans d'avance sur moi.
Ah...
nous suspectons Johnson d'avoir payé
Brandt pour tuer le maire.
- Quoi ?
- Quand la vérité sortira,
cela pourrait vraiment
faire du tort à votre carrière.
"Culpabilité par association".
Je ne crois pas qu'Adrian
est lié au meurtre de Loewen
mais j'apprécie
que vous vous souciez de moi.
Hm.
Je détesterais voir
un homme charmant comme vous
plonger inutilement.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Perry ?
Il faut que tu fasses
quelque chose pour moi.
- Tuer Willy Brandt ?
- Oui.
Et Leo Glynn.
La 3ème cause de décès
en Amérique, ce sont les attaques,
ou comme on aime dire
ces jours-ci, l'accident cérébral.
Sérieusement.
C'est un vrai terme médical.
Mais lesquels parmi nous
n'ont pas senti leur cerveau attaqué ?
Et eu des parties d'eux-mêmes
bloquées, paralysées,
ce qui nous force
à continuer à rétorquer ?
Après la mort de Cutler,
j'ai commencé,
comme je le faisais autrefois,
à brutaliser des gars
et à jouer au chef.
J'ai dépassé beaucoup
de limites dans la vie, ma sœur.
Mais faire du mal
à ma femme,
c'est une limite que je n'aurais
jamais cru dépasser.
Je disais toujours que je ne lèverais
jamais la main sur Liesel.
Vous savez, être au trou,
ça m'a donné le temps de penser
à qui je suis et veux être.
Très bien.
Imaginons que vous pourriez
rendre à nouveau visite à Liesel.
Que feriez-vous
différemment ?
Je parlerais.
Je la prendrais
dans mes bras.
Je caresserais
ses cheveux,
mais je ne mettrais pas
sa main dans mon pantalon.
Merde, qu'est-ce que
je pensais ?
Et vous parleriez de quoi ?
Je ne sais pas...
de la vie.
La vie sans elle,
comme c'est dur.
Et ?
Et ce truc avec Cutler,
je suppose.
Quel truc ?
Vous savez quel truc.
James, en exprimant
ce qui s'est passé,
vous l'acceptez.
C'est la première étape
vers la guérison.
Je dirais à ma femme
que j'ai été violé
et que c'est pour ça
que je ne l'ai pas appelée si longtemps.
Et je lui dirais
que je suis désolé
d'être devenu
un tel connard.
Je suis venu à Oz
il y a 9 mois.
J'étais... vierge,
alors, j'ai été visé
tout de suite.
Alors, je ne respectais les règles,
je refusais
d'aller travailler,
de prendre une douche,
des conneries comme ça.
Ils m'ont mis
en Restriction Spéciale.
Je pensais que je serais en sécurité,
enfermé dans ma cellule.
Mais alors,
ils ont mis ce salaud
dans ma cellule et il...
il m'a battu
jusqu'à ce que
je dise oui.
Quand il le faisait, j'entendais
la TV dans la salle des gardes.
Ils regardaient
"l Love Lucy".
Le jour de Thanksgiving,
six gars sont venus dans ma cellule
pendant que je dormais.
Ils m'ont maîtrisé
et m'ont mis un rasoir sous la gorge.
J'ai demandé un kit
pour prouver ce qui s'était passé.
Le garde a attendu deux jours
pour m'emmener à l'infirmerie.
Il a dit qu'il m'avait acheté
pour deux cartouches de Kools.
Quand l'infirmière m'a examiné,
il ne restait plus rien à trouver.
J'ai... essayé de m'en sortir
mais j'ai manqué d'argent.
A tour de rôle, ils m'ont violé
oralement et analement.
Quelqu'un a écrit à ma mère.
Elle a écrit au directeur.
- On me louait.
- "SVP, aidez mon fils".
- 3 $ pour une fellation.
- Le salopard m'a dit...
5 $ pour une sodomisation.
"Arrête de geindre,
lève-toi et bats-toi.
J'ai gardé les pilules pour dormir
que la sœur me donnait
pendant 10 jours,
1.000 milligrammes.
Une nuit, après...
je les ai toutes prises.
- Je n'avais pas le choix.
- Je n'avais pas le choix.
- Je n'avais pas le choix.
- Je n'avais pas le choix.
Je n'avais pas le choix.
Je n'avais pas le choix.
- Tu veux des affaires de Morales ?
- Non.
J'ai des regrets.
Enrique était vraiment fâché
avec moi quand il est mort.
C'est probablement mieux
qu'il soit mort.
Il t'aurait rendu
la vie impossible.
C'est vrai.
Mais il n'a plus de famille.
Ils vont foutre son corps
à Potter's Field.
Il ne saura pas
la différence.
De plus en plus, compadre,
j'en ai marre de toute cette merde.
Je te comprends, mec.
Pancamo m'a demandé
qui serait le leader d'El Norte.
Qu'est-ce que tu as dit ?
Toi.
Mon cul.
Je serai docile jusqu'à ma prochaine
audience de conditionnelle.
- Miguel.
- Non.
- Vous avez une visite-surprise.
- Ma copine Maritza ?
Non. Cathy Jo Cutler.
- C'est la...
- La veuve éplorée de Wolfgang Cutler.
Bon.
C'est bien.
Je comprends pourquoi
il m'a laissé toute sa merde.
Ouais, bonne chance.
Hé.
Bonjour.
- Cathy Jo, n'est-ce pas ?
- Oui.
Merci de me voir.
Bien sûr.
M. Alvarez, je suis là
pour vous demander,
vous supplier...
Attendez.
Tout d'abord,
c'est Miguel, d'accord ?
Laissez-moi vous épargnez
un petit discours.
Je ne veux pas
des merdes de votre mari.
Oh.
Je ne savais pas
que vous aviez décidé ça.
Je viens de le faire.
Je n'ai pas dormi
de la nuit
à me demander
ce que j'allais vous dire,
à vous, le nouveau propriétaire
du lit où je dormais.
Faites quelque chose
pour moi d'abord. D'accord ?
Dites-moi pourquoi
il a fait ça.
Croyez-moi,
je me suis creusé la tête.
Il aimait m'emmerder
concernant les cordons
de la bourse.
Peut-être que
c'est bien fait pour moi.
Pourquoi l'ai-je épousé,
si je ne l'ai jamais aimé ?
Vous n'êtes pas marié.
Non, non.
Une copine...
Elle ne vient plus
maintenant.
Ah...
Bon, alors c'est tout.
Merci d'être un meilleur mari
que mon mari,
si cela a un sens.
Quand vous voudrez.
Je vous reverrai peut-être ?
Pour signer des papiers
ou quelque chose.
D'accord, Miguel.
D'accord, Cathy.
- Fais tes prières, Enrique.
- Non.
Tu es comme Martinez,
un homme méchant
qui mérite de mourir.
Que ton règne arrive.
Que ta volonté soit faite
sur la terre comme au ciel.
Donne-nous aujourd'hui
notre pain quotidien
et pardonne-nous
nos offenses
comme nous pardonnons
à ceux qui nous ont offensés.
Et ne nous laisse
point tomber en tentation
mais délivre-nous du mal.
Amen.
Vous savez, un jour,
peut-être bientôt,
ces gars emporteront
mon corps.
Non, vous serez mis
en liberté conditionnelle.
Je pensais...
qu'on devrait organiser
une rencontre entre vous et Luis Ruiz.
J'ai frappé ce salopard
dans la gueule.
Il ne viendra pas
prendre le thé.
Steve Dawkins va prendre
sa retraite du comité de conditionnelle
et la rumeur dit que Ruiz
le remplacera.
Vous aurez besoin de lui
de votre côté.
D'accord. Je ferai ce que
vous dites tous les deux.
Je ne veux pas finir
comme Enrique Morales.
Je ne veux pas finir
au dépotoir.
Le rapport d'autopsie montre
qu'Enrique Morales
a été étouffé
comme Martinez.
Vous pensez que
Dave Brass a fait ça ?
Je parie que
c'est le même meurtrier.
Il me faut une liste des malades
à l'infirmerie ces deux nuits-là.
J'ai déjà regardé.
Il n'y en avait pas.
Morales avait beaucoup d'ennemis.
Il y a peut-être deux meurtriers.
Et votre personnel ?
Ils n'ont rien vu ?
L'équipe de nuit
est squelettique.
Qui était de service ?
Carol Grace,
Gerald Lesowski.
Carol Grace...
Morales m'a dit
quelque chose à son sujet.
que je devrais vérifier son passé.
Elle vient d'où ?
Je ne sais pas.
Elle a été engagée avant mon arrivée.
Sortez son dossier.
A vous couper le souffle.
C'est une belle façon de décrire
quelque chose ou quelqu'un.
Merde, qu'est-ce qu'il y a de bien
à avoir le souffle coupé ?
Les maladies respiratoires
se placent en n°4
dans notre petit hit-parade
et pour de bonnes raisons,
parce que peu importe
qui vous coupe le souffle,
quatre paquets par jour
ou juste une nana,
vous serez tout aussi mort.
Carol...
pourriez-vous venir
dans mon bureau un instant, SVP ?
Entendu, Docteur.
Bonjour,
M. Le Directeur.
Nous avons regardé
votre dossier professionnel, Carol.
Avant de venir à Oswald,
vous avez travaillé à l'hôpital
Millard Fillmore de Buffalo
et à Saint Eligius à Boston ?
De quoi s'agit-il ?
Vous avez été renvoyée
des deux institutions. Pourquoi ?
La jalousie.
Les patients
me préféraient toujours.
Nous avons vérifié
aux deux endroits.
Huit hommes au total
sont morts pendant vos gardes.
J'ai vérifié
nos certificats de décès.
Trois prisonniers sont décédés
pendant votre service.
Qu'est-ce que vous insinuez ?
La police va vous emmener
au centre-ville aux Homicides.
Bien, laissez-moi
prendre mes affaires.
Dégage, toi !
Laisse-moi tranquille,
salopard !
Laisse-moi tranquille,
espèce de pute latino !
Salope !
Pute latino !
Laissez-moi partir !
Les accidents
sont la 5ème cause de décès.
Mais vous savez
aussi bien que moi
que les accidents,
ça n'existe pas.
C'est un mot bidon qu'on utilise
au lieu de se faire des reproches.
Quels que soient les mensonges
qu'on vous a dits
nous sommes la 1ère cause
de décès... L'humanité...
et on ne peut pas
nous guérir.
C'est les salaires.
On ne peut pas
rivaliser avec Arif.
Je ne me fais pas
de soucis, Burr.
Je le vois.
Expliquez-moi pourquoi.
Ici, c'est une prison.
Il y a 28 000 hommes qui traînent
à ne rien à faire.
En termes économiques,
la main-d'œuvre excède la demande.
Mais ce qui fait une prison,
c'est la fierté à l'intérieur,
savoir que d'autres prisonniers
gagnent 20 fois
plus que vous ?
Je le redis,
la main-d'œuvre et la demande.
Vous, mon ami,
allez recruter plus.
J'ai déjà fait appel
à tous mes soldats.
Ils désertent.
Faites plus de publicité.
Nous nous débrouillerons
avec la moitié du personnel
deux ou trois jours, mais c'est tout.
La vie, c'est là
où on arrivera...
Je suppose que tu ne voudrais pas
échanger cette cuillère
contre un téléphone, O'Reily ?
Viens dans notre entreprise.
Ce serait un rêve
qui se réalise,
emmerder des inconnus
au moment du dîner.
Il n'y a pas d'argent
à la cuisine.
C'est pourquoi je suis
M. "Subventions".
Salut, les gars.
Vous êtes nouveaux à Oz ?
Vous n'avez pas encore eu
l'occasion de vous installer.
Au lieu de vous mêler
à toutes les conneries
de tribus qu'il y a ici,
vous devez savoir
que ces jours-ci,
il y a mieux à faire à Oz.
Hm.
Ça s'appelle travailler.
J'ai entendu parler de ça.
Tu es avec ce gars, Arif ?
Non, je suis avec moi.
Burr Redding.
Le télémarketing.
Je vais essayer d'avoir
une 2ème portion avant qu'ils ferment.
Malgré le mal
qu'on en dit,
un travail de vendeur
en télémarketing
est une bonne façon
de rester actif.
Ça me revient, j'ai un RDV
avec Sœur Pete.
Et toi ? Tu vas aller
te branler aussi ?
Non, je prends le boulot.
Bien, mon garçon.
Mais je suis dyslexique.
Débarrasse mon plateau,
petit minable.
Hé, patron,
c'est le jour de la paie.
Ouais... je sais.
Où est mon argent ?
Tu devras attendre
la fin de la semaine prochaine.
Quoi ?
J'attends qu'un chèque
soit encaissé et alors,
j'aurai ton argent, crois-moi.
Te croire ?
Putain.
Excuse-moi.
Je te le dis, poète,
à part l'argent que j'ai volé,
je suis fauché
comme les blés.
On ne peut plus attendre.
On doit de nouveau
vendre de la came.
Je suis bien en avance
sur toi, Reggie.
J'ai un petit contact dehors,
mon pote Sky Bar.
Le chargement
arrive aujourd'hui.
- Bon, mon salaud.
- D'accord ?
Oui !
Poète, dommage
pour ton ami Sky Bar.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
- Tu n'as pas entendu ?
Une Chevy lui a roulé dessus
37 fois.
Prisonnier n° 97G141 :
Samuel Gougeon.
Reconnu coupable le 5 août 1997.
Homicide involontaire.
Condamnation : 19 ans.
Conditionnelle au bout de 10 ans.
Vous savez, la campagne politique
la plus formidable,
c'est "Jésus, c'est l'amour"
et Dieu lui-même est en lice.
Raccroche,
enfant de chœur !
C'est complètement débile
d'utiliser mon lieu de travail
pour vendre ta religion.
- Je suis désolé, je...
- Ouais, sans blague.
Et maintenant,
tu vas te repentir.
Hm.
J'ai un boulot spécial
pour toi.
Et là, tu ne demanderas pas :
"Que ferait Jésus ?"
Dépêche-toi.
Afin que la vue de mes péchés
et de mes imperfections
me les fasse regretter.
Mon Dieu, j'ai un très grand
regret de vous avoir offensé
parce que vous êtes infiniment bon,
et que le péché vous déplaît.
C'était toi,
n'est-ce pas ?
Entre, Arif.
Tu es un pathétique
et corrompu, tu le sais ?
Corrompu, d'accord.
Mais je ne dirais pas pathétique.
Vandaliser mon affaire pour repeupler
la tienne ? C'est quoi, alors ?
Travailler à plus petite échelle,
pour le bien commun.
Je te donne une chance d'aller
dire la vérité à Glynn avant moi.
Personne n'ira rien dire
à personne, fiston.
Les affaires ne marchaient pas
très bien, n'est-ce pas ?
Comment tu le saurais ?
A Wall Street,
on appelle ça la reconnaissance.
Tu devrais m'être
reconnaissant.
Tu pourras te faire indemniser
par l'assurance
et récupérer tout l'argent
que tes frères musulmans ont perdu.
Et tu te débarrasseras
de tous tes soucis.
Hm ?
Merci quand même.
- Il a avoué ?
- Je dois réfléchir.
Réfléchir à quoi ?
Il est coupable, non ?
Non.
Ce qui s'est passé avec nos machines,
c'était un accident.
13 ans après avoir
affirmé le contraire,
La Cour Suprême
a fait volte-face
et décidé d'interdire
la condamnation à mort
des accusés
handicapés mentaux.
"Le grand nombre d'Etats
interdisant l'exécution
de malades mentaux
démontre qu'aujourd'hui,
notre société considère
les criminels arriérés mentaux
catégoriquement
moins coupables
que le criminel moyen".
Comment va Cyril ?
Il n'a plus déféqué sur lui
et dort beaucoup.
Que veut dire beaucoup ?
Par intermittence,
toute la journée.
Peut-être que c'est
une bonne chose.
Nous attendons toujours
la suspension de la Cour Suprême,
mais je ne sais pas
si on l'obtiendra.
Il pourrait peut-être
dormir jusqu'au moment
où ils l'endormiront
pour toujours.
Ryan,
La mort par injection chimique,
ce n'est pas comme s'endormir.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Cela rend l'exécution
plus facile pour le public,
pour le personnel,
mais nous ne connaissons pas
la douleur qu'elle provoque.
Peu de gens le savent
- qu'elle a été inventée par les Nazis.
- Quoi ?
Le médecin d'Hitler
a inventé le procédé
comme moyen
de tuer des enfants
- et finalement des adultes.
- Hitler ?
Ces salauds
n'avaient guère de pitié...
Je veux juste ce qui est mieux
pour Cyril, c'est tout.
Eh bien...
Je me demandais
si peut-être
La chaise électrique ne serait pas
une meilleure façon de partir.
La chaise ? Pourquoi pas
le donner à manger aux lions ?
Réfléchissez.
Il a reçu des électrochocs,
ce qui n'est pas si différent
de l'électrocution.
Du moins, dans son esprit,
ça ne le serait pas nécessairement.
Il a l'habitude des lanières
et des électrodes.
Dites-lui juste qu'il va avoir
une séance spéciale.
Il ne saura peut-être jamais
la différence.
Putain.
Hé !
Pst ! Allez, Cyril,
réveille-toi.
Hm.
Alors...
tu veux les bonnes
ou les mauvaises nouvelles d'abord ?
- Les bonnes.
- D'accord.
Les bonnes nouvelles,
c'est que tu auras ta dernière séance
d'électrochocs dans quelques jours.
Pourquoi c'est la dernière séance ?
Parce que tu as été
un tel champion jusque là.
Et comme tu as été si bien,
ils te feront remonter là-haut.
Ils aménageront ta cellule
tout spécialement
et te donneront une télé, hm ?
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Je pourrai regarder
ce que je veux ?
Ce qu'on voudra.
Je serai avec toi.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Et hm...
ils te feront un bon dîner
et tu pourras manger
tout ce que tu aimes.
Je pourrai avoir un sandwich
beurre de cacahuètes-guimauve ?
Tu pourras en avoir deux.
Deux sandwichs
beurre de cacahuètes-guimauve.
Tu veux savoir
les mauvaises nouvelles ?
D'accord.
Ils devront... te couper
les cheveux.
Pourquoi ?
J'aime bien mes cheveux.
Je sais, mon vieux,
mais pour cette dernière séance,
ils devront te les couper, désolé.
Ça repoussera ?
Mon pote, tu fais honte
à Rapunzel.
Ça va repousser,
hein, Ryan ?
Mais oui.
Les ongles pousseront
aussi là en bas.
Après Rapunzel,
tu seras Elvira.
Hé, mec, arrête.
Concentre-toi sur les cheveux,
d'accord ?
On n'a pas besoin
de commentaires en couleur.
Tu sais quoi ?
Laisse-moi
couper un peu.
J'attends ça
depuis des années.
Putain !
Nom de Dieu, je peux
de nouveau voir ta figure,
beau gosse.
Ryan, regarde.
Ecoute...
Je ne suis pas très amical
depuis que je suis à Oz
mais maintenant,
j'ai parlé à Suzanne
et je suis conscient
du mal que tu t'es donné
pour stopper l'exécution
de ton frère.
J'admire tes efforts.
Je veux que tu saches
qu'à l'heure de sa mort,
toute la Em City
sera avec lui.
Ah oui ? Comment ?
Tu verras.
Allons-y, O'Reily.
Des nouvelles
de la Cour Suprême de l'Etat ?
Non. Vous resterez dans la cellule
de votre frère, ce soir.
Quand ils le feront descendre,
nous vous ramènerons ici.
Je me demandais
si au moment de sa mort,
- je pourrais être seul.
- Restez avec votre groupe.
Pourrais-je aller
dans votre labyrinthe de méditation ?
D'accord.
Suite à un procès
particulièrement brûlant,
qui n'a fait qu'accroître
le désaccord
sur l'exécution
des handicapés mentaux.
Cet après-midi,
au pénitencier Oswald...
- C'était quoi à propos d'Oz ?
- Rien.
Pourquoi ce gars me regarde
et prend des notes ?
Ça fait toujours partie
de la dernière séance d'électrochocs.
J'ai mal au ventre.
C'est tout ce que tu as mangé,
gros bêta.
Hé,
si on s'allongeait
un moment
pour faire
une petite sieste ?
J'ai oublié
de demander des Rolaids.
Ça va, toi, Ryan ?
Ouais,
du moment que toi,
ça va.
Chaque Etat décide si une personne
est arriérée mentale ou non.
Un meurtrier peut être condamné
à vie dans le Maine,
où on le considère
arriéré mental,
mais être gazé en lowa, où il est
assez normal pour mourir.
Le même gars, les mêmes problèmes,
le même crime,
deux destins opposés
dépendant quelle frontière d'Etat
invisible il traverse.
La culpabilité et l'innocence,
toute l'identité de quelqu'un
est maintenant
une question de géographie.
Une chose
que je ne t'ai pas dite, Cyril,
c'est qu'il y aura d'autres gens
qui te regarderont aujourd'hui.
Qui ?
Voyons... Le directeur,
Sœur Pete,
Maman, le Dr Nathan
et quelques autres
que tu ne reconnaîtras pas.
Oh.
Tu seras là ?
Non, je voudrais
mais je ne peux pas.
Pourquoi ?
Papa a dit :
"Les grands garçons
ne doivent pas pleurer".
Tu sais quoi ?
Papa avait tort
et moi aussi.
On avait tous tort, Cyril.
Je suis désolé.
J'ai fait quelque chose ?
Non.
Non.
Le Dr Nathan a dit
que j'ai ce truc
et...
que la seule façon
de guérir,
c'est de pleurer.
Tu sais, ça n'a rien
à voir avec toi.
Je suis désolé.
N'aie pas peur, d'accord ?
Oups, j'ai des gaz
à cause du dîner.
- Maman !
- Bonjour, alors...
- Des nouvelles de Zelman ?
- Non.
Hé, bonjour.
Tu es mignon.
Assieds-toi.
Je veux t'apprendre
une petite prière que je sais.
C'est comme ça.
"Seigneur Jésus-Christ,
ayez pitié..."
Hé.
Il ne serait pas possible
que j'aie
une copie de ce journal
que vous écrivez ?
Je crains que non.
Non, juste un...
vous savez,
un petit arrêt
à la photocopieuse.
Personne ne le saura, je le jure.
Je ne le montrerai à personne.
C'est promis.
Vous devez partir.
Seigneur Jésus,
ayez pitié de moi.
Seigneur Jésus,
ayez pitié de moi.
Seigneur Jésus,
ayez pitié de moi.
Seigneur Jésus,
ayez pitié de moi.
Viens, on doit partir.
Amen.
Hé.
Qui t'aime ?
- Toi.
- C'est vrai.
Plus que tu ne le sauras jamais.
Je veux juste
que tu te détendes, d'accord ?
Tu sais
comme tu t'effraies.
Pense à moi, d'accord ?
D'accord.
Bravo, mon garçon.
Qu'est-ce qui c'est ?
Rien.
Voici les vêtements
que vous avez demandés.
Je n'ai pas demandé
de vêtements.
C'est le T-shirt
de Ryan ?
Il a dit que je pouvais
le porter ?
Selon un consensus général
les arriérés mentaux
sont moins responsables
de leurs crimes
que les personnes
d'intelligence normale.
Mais si c'est le cas,
quelque chose ou quelqu'un
doit être tenu pour responsable,
rattraper le retard
et être blâmé, n'est-ce pas ?
Après tout, les victimes
meurent de morts horribles
et les familles
ont toujours du chagrin.
Si la personne arriérée mentale
n'est pas totalement en faute,
alors qui ou quoi
partage la responsabilité ?
Dieu ? La nature humaine ?
La société ?
La question, c'est peut-être,
qui n'est pas à blâmer ?
Pourquoi je dois
avoir ces menottes ?
Où sont mes chaussures ?
- Bonjour, Cyril.
- Bonjour.
Je n'ai pas besoin
de mes chaussures ?
"Dans la vallée de l'ombre,
je ne crains pas la mort.
Ta force et ta présence
seront mon réconfort.
Tu m'a dressé la table
d'un merveilleux festin.
Ton huile vivifiante
rayonne sur mon front.
Ta coupe débordante
m'enivre de ton vin.
Ta grâce et ta lumière
sans fin me poursuivront
et jusqu'en ta demeure,
un jour m'introduiront".
Qu'est-ce qui se passe,
putain ?
Vous pouvez faire
une dernière déclaration.
Hein ?
Dick ?
Bonjour.
Non, pas de raison de ne pas procéder
à l'exécution. Nous sommes prêts.
Oui, c'est Glynn,
le Directeur de la prison.
Ah, ha.
Entendu.
D'accord.
Sur ordre de la Cour Suprême
de l'Etat,
La condamnation à mort
de Cyril O'Reily est suspendue
au vu de nouveaux éléments
d'appréciation de son appel.
- Oui !
- Son exécution est reportée
jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Et la séance spéciale, alors ?
Flash-back en 1989,
quand la Cour Suprême
a déclaré à ce sujet :
"Etant donné l'évolution
des critères de décence
marquant le progrès
d'une société devenant plus mature,
il n'y a pas
assez de preuves
d'un consensus national
contre ces exécutions".
Apparemment, aujourd'hui,
elles existent.
Les sondages montrent
que la plupart des Américains
pensent qu'un adulte
ayant l'intelligence d'un enfant de CE2
ne devrait pas être exécuté.
Mais sommes-nous une société
devenant plus mature
avec des critères de décence
en évolution ?
Qui dira que nous sommes
plus avancés
qu'un certain équivalent
cosmique du CE2 ?
Qui dira, que nous, en tant qu'entité,
ne sommes pas arriérés mentaux ?
La Sainte Bible
Merci.

Mon Combat
"Junk" signifie "vieilleries". Des trucs
qui ont eu une valeur pour nous
mais dont nous
n'avons plus besoin.
Certaines sont rangées dans
l'espoir de pouvoir les réutiliser.
D'autres sont jetées.
Pas vraiment définitivement,
elles sont juste hors de vue.
Les vieilleries sont encore
et toujours quelque part.
Le bouquin de Hill.
La vache, il écrit bien.
Ça me rend
un peu jaloux.
- T'as de la came ?
- Non, j'ai plus rien.
Putain, j'ai rien pris
depuis si longtemps,
j'ai l'impression d'ętre
en désintox.
Ouais, on n'a pas
de revenus.
La reliure de livres
ça marche plus.
Les ritals nous empęchent
de trafiquer.
- Quelque chose va se présenter.
- T'es sűr ?
J'suis comme
ce bon vieux Billy Clinton.
Toujours plein d'espoir.
Prisonnier n°° 03B563 :
Stanley Bukowski ;
Condamné le 16 janvier 2003 ;
pour possession et distribution
de substances illégales ;
15 ans de prison
dont sept fermes.
Eh, nouveau.
T'as de la came ?
- Non, les trucs durs, j'aime pas.
- T'as de l'herbe ?
Y'a pas de quoi
pour satisfaire la demande
dans ce putain d'endroit.
Mais je vais recevoir
une livraison.
Fais gaffe
oů t'allume mon pote.
Non, non, rien ŕ fumer.
Juste ŕ manger.
J'ai un paquet
de gâteaux sympas ŕ l'herbe
bien verte qui vont
bientôt arriver.
J'vais peut-ętre commencer
une petite affaire
si vous voyez
ce que je veux dire.
Ben, ce sont des partenaires
qu'il te faut,
sinon certaines personnes
vont découvrir
que tu marches
sur leur territoire.
On peut t'éviter des ennuis.
C'est de la connerie.
Ça passera jamais ŕ l'inspection.
Il connaît pas
les bons gardes-chiourmes.
Ouais, j'ai tout prévu, d'accord ?
L'herbe est
complčtement i-o-nizée,
alors elle sent rien.
Męme pas au nez des clebs.
Le reste de la recette,
mon secret bien gardé.
J'peux juste vous dire
qu'on se prend un pied du tonnerre.
Et vous savez quoi ?
Double dose de chocolat
avec glaçage super épais
pour faire joli.
T'es un génie.
- Quoi de neuf ?
- J'aime ça.
Allez, mon pote.
Courrier !
- C'est tout ?
- Ouais.
Bukowski,
t'as une boîte de gâteaux.
Voilŕ, mon pote.
- Régale-toi bien.
- Merci.
Bienvenue sur "Sallycize".
Nous allons jouer au volley
aujourd'hui. Sortez vos balles
et assurez-vous qu'elles sont
fermes et rondes,
parce qu'on va
les faire rebondir.
Sur le côté, et en l'air.
C'est ça.
Gardez le poignet
bien raide...
C'est le meilleur
épisode de tous.
Et raide, sautez, et raide, sautez.
Trčs bien, tout le monde.
Sautez, Faites travailler
vos bras, raides, raides et durs.
Ouais, durs, pompez !
Des gâteaux au ganja.
On aurait dű y penser !
Ce con va nous
sucrer nos bénefs.
Il pourrait bien nous
faire du mal.
Ce salaud a besoin
de funérailles.
Pena di morte.
Y'a du beurre lŕ dedans.
Bien entendu, y'a du beurre,
c'est un gâteau au chocolat.
Ce qu'on essaie de faire,
c'est découvrir
L'ingrédient secret
de Bukowski.
Merde, on peut
y passer notre vie.
La seule solution c'est d'obtenir
la recette de Bukowski lui-męme.
Ouais, ouais, ensuite on peut
se débarrasser de son cul blanc.
Feriez mieux de me laisser tranquille,
ou mes potes vont...
- Quoi, ils vont s'attaquer ŕ nous ?
- Ouais.
Appelle-les.
Vas-y.
Oh, ça sent le roussi.
Viens, on va se promener.
- Il est mort ?
- Il paraît que son visage a fondu.
Notre nouvelle
entreprise est foutue.
Quoi ? On a bien
sa recette, non ?
Non, je l'ai téléphonée
ŕ mon cousin
et il en a fait une tournée.
Il a dit que c'était de la merde.
Attends un peu,
Bukowski nous a menti ?
Putain, on peut faire
confiance ŕ personne.
C'est de la faute des ritals.
Allons leur casser la gueule.
Attends. J'ai un plan
et ça commence par Burr.
Eh, Burr.
On veut revenir.
On fera ce que tu veux,
télémarketing, n'importe.
Pour commencer, répčte ça.
A genoux cette fois.
- T'es sérieux ?
- Plie-les !
Allez, les mecs.
A genoux.
Eh, on... on...
Ferme-la ! J'ai entendu
la premičre fois.
Pointez-vous demain matin,
pręts ŕ bosser au téléphone.
Amenez-vous, allez.
Voyez, je savais que vous
trouveriez des remplaçants.
J'ai fini par
convaincre mes gars
de suivre le droit chemin.
OK, on est lŕ.
Maintenant
tu m'expliques ton plan ?
Les cartes de crédit.
Chaque fois qu'on prend une commande,
on pique le numéro
de la carte.
Mon cousin Malcolm peut
les vendre pour un max de tune.
Du trafic cybernétique.
- J'adore ça.
- Pas mal, hein.
Il y a 10 mois,
des plongeurs sous-marins
ont trouvé deux morceaux
du P.T. 109 dans le pacifique.
Le bateau que JFK dirigeait
pendant la Deuxičme Guerre Mondiale,
coulé par
un destroyer japonais.
Jadis, ils ont aussi trouvé
le Titanic, le Hunley,
et des centaines de milliers
d'autres bateaux disparus en mer.
A se demander
tout ce qu'il y a lŕ en bas.
Dans quel état
est le fond marin ?
Le mieux c'est que la faune
sous-marine s'y adapte.
Ils s'approprient
nos détritus navals,
et en font leur habitat.
Oů est Stella ?
J'ai besoin de lui parler.
On lui enlčve
sa tumeur aujourd'hui.
Mon Dieu, ouais,
j'avais oublié.
Son amie doit appeler
pour donner des nouvelles.
Je suis sűr
que tout ira bien.
Allo, oui ?
J'aimerais faire
envoyer des fleurs.
- Des nouvelles de Stella ?
- Non.
Je pensais que
l'opération était terminée.
Parfois ils prennent du retard
dans les hôpitaux.
Eh, rat de bibliothčque !
Rat de bibliothčque !
Tu vas en bouquiner
un autre, pédale ?
- Fais pas attention ŕ lui.
- Je l'emmerde.
Rentre dans ta cellule !
C'est l'heure
de l'appel. Allez.
J'ai toujours pas de nouvelles
de Stella. Encore cinq minutes.
C'est maintenant ou le trou.
T'inquičte pas.
Stella est indestructible.
Personne n'est indestructible.
C'est drôle, je me suis laissé
aller ŕ penser qu'elle avait
besoin de moi
pour vaincre le cancer,
mais je me suis trompé.
Et ça fait
encore plus mal.
Dieu merci.
Le score est égalité,
tout le monde.
On va beaucoup s'accroupir,
bouger rapidement, pousser...
Super.
Faisons travailler
le muscle des fantasmes.
Frappez-moi
ces balles, Allez !
Ils devraient repasser l'épisode
de la cour d'école.
D'autant plus que Busmalis
n'a pas appris
sa leçon la premičre fois.
Miss Sally dit "N'essaie pas
d'épouser ma salope de secrétaire".
Ils sont jaloux.
Seuls les anciens sont
de vrais Roméos.
Tu vas vraiment
recommencer ?
Te faire planter
devant l'autel et tout ?
Męme si le mariage se fait,
il va jouer au papa
avec le gosse d'un autre.
Pour certains,
c'est un acte de générosité.
Pour moi
c'est un acte d'insanité.
Le mioche a été conçu pendant
ce qui aurait dű ętre ta lune de miel.
C'est plus zarbi
que le clonage.
Le directeur ne va pas le laisser
consommer son union.
- Un mariage sans sexe n'en est pas un.
- C'est vrai.
Tu ne vas rien dire ?
C'est vrai que t'as de sérieux
problčmes ŕ résoudre.
Super.
Et bien ŕ vous tous,
sexy célibataires solitaires
avec personne d'autre que Rosie
Paume et ses cinq sśurs
pour vous aimer,
je dis ceci.
Juste lŕ, baby.
Dans mes grosses
balles bleues,
qui reviennent ŕ la vie
car je vais ŕ la chapelle
et je vais me marier, youpi !
Tu ferais bien
de te casser.
Arrętez ça.
Elle va arriver.
Elle est plus d'une heure
et demi en retard.
Savez-vous le peu de temps
que ça représente
quand on en a
pris pour 10 ans ?
On va attendre
encore un peu.
Tu devrais peut-ętre
envisager la possibilité...
Jamais ! Elle sera lŕ
dans trois secondes.
Un, deux...
Deux et demi.
Je suis tellement désolée !
- J'espčre que tu as eu mon message.
- Quel message ?
J'ai appelé pour prévenir que
la baby-sitter était en retard.
Celui qui a répondu a promis
de passer le message.
Les promesses ont peu
de valeur ŕ Oz.
La mienne en a.
Epouse-moi !
En avant la musique,
mon Pčre !
En 1957, le premier satellite
fut envoyé dans l'espace.
Depuis, 4.186 autres
ont suivi.
300 d'entre eux
y sont encore,
hors d'usage, abandonnés.
Certains de la taille d'une voiture.
Parfois on dit
que l'un d'eux
va tomber du ciel
et va toucher la terre.
Les experts disent
"N'ayez crainte, il va probablement
tomber dans l'océan".
La plupart du temps
ils ont raison, mais, mon frčre,
je ne veux pas ętre lŕ
La fois oů
ils auront tort.
J'ai demandé d'ętre incarcéré
ŕ Em City dans un but
et un seul,
celui de trouver
quelqu'un pour me tuer.
Bonjour.
T'as pensé ŕ
un moyen de me tuer ?
Non.
J'peux pas
me concentrer
si tu me casses
les couilles sans arręt.
On pourrait au moins
parler de dates ?
A l'appel !
Faut que je voie
McManus tout de suite.
De toutes les aberrations
que tu aies dites et faites,
et elles sont nombreuses,
c'est la plus ridicule.
C'est fou, je sais,
mais c'est vrai.
Idzik veut que je le bute.
Ouais, c'est ça.
C'est juste une pičtre tentative
pour brouiller les pistes.
Tu as menacé de le tuer
depuis son arrivée ici.
C'est vrai,
mais je sais pas...
Qu'il me supplie de le faire,
c'est bizarre,
C'est mal.
Vraiment ridicule.
Tire-toi de mon bureau.
- McManus...
- Maintenant !
Alors ?
Ecoute,
mets-toi ŕ ma place.
Tu me demandes
de commettre un acte criminel
et pourtant tu refuses
de me dire pourquoi.
J'ai tué Kareem Said.
Ça te suffit pas
comme raison ?
Pour moi, ouais, ouais,
c'est... mais tout de męme,
j'aimerais savoir
pourquoi tu veux mourir.
OK.
Mais pas ici, suis-moi.
La lumičre.
C'est de ça qu'il s'agit.
C'est ce qui
fait tout marcher.
Pas juste
dans cette pičce,
mais partout sur la plančte,
dans chaque coin de l'univers,
La lumičre engendre la vie.
Mais ça va s'arręter.
Que veux-tu dire, comment ?
Quand des soleils
et des étoiles explosent
ils créent de nouveaux soleils,
de nouvelles étoiles.
Et chaque fois,
ces nouvelles entités
sont plus petites,
et contiennent
moins d'énergie.
Et quand ils explosent
ŕ leur tour, c'est inévitable,
Les prochains
soleils et étoiles
sont encore plus petits,
encore plus faibles.
Finalement tout le gaz,
toute la chaleur
toute la lumičre
vont se dissiper.
Les galaxies vont devenir
froides et inertes.
Et que va t-il
nous arriver alors ?
Sans lumičre,
nous cessons d'exister.
On pourrait peut-ętre...
construire une fusée, non ?
Omar, il faudrait de l'énergie
pour envoyer la fusée
dans l'espace.
D'ailleurs, y'aurait
nulle part oů aller.
On ne peut éviter
l'inévitable.
Toute vie va cesser.
Merde.
Tout ce qu'on fait,
tous nos projets,
nos espoirs,
c'est futile.
Etre bon travailleur,
et je l'étais,
construire une maison,
je l'ai fait, élever une famille...
j'en avais une;
tout ça ne veut rien dire.
Parce que peu importe
combien nous essayons,
combien nous nous battons,
ça revient tout ŕ zéro.
La vie est
une perte de temps.
C'est pourquoi
je compte sur toi
pour me tuer.
Tu va le faire,
n'est-ce pas ?
Ecoute, écoute,
il me faut plus de temps.
Pour réfléchir, d'accord ?
Je te donnerai une réponse
avant midi, d'accord ?
Eh, Reb,
t'as de la littérature sur...
La fin du monde ?
Nébuleuses,
néb... nébuleuses.
Galaxies et quasars,
c'est génial.
Chaleur.
Chaleur et...
gaz.
C'est simple.
Il est midi et tu as dit
que tu aurais une réponse.
J'en ai une.
Viens ici. Regarde.
J'ai lu plein de scénarios
sur la fin des temps.
De l'apocalypse
ŕ, euh. La théorie
du "big crunch",
euh, les trous noirs,
Les météorites qui
bombardent la terre.
C'est comme tu as dit.
Quoi que l'on fasse, un jour,
La lumičre, la chaleur,
et le gaz
disparaîtront
pour toujours.
Mais il y a une chose,
une chose que
tu n'a pas mentionnée.
Ce sera pas le néant.
Y'aura pas juste
rien du tout.
Tu vois, la force
la plus faible de la nature
deviendra dominante,
et c'est la g-r-a-v-i-t-é,
- la gravité.
- Et alors ?
Alors ? Alors ?
Quelque chose existera encore.
Y'aura encore une énergie
dans l'univers.
Peut-ętre que nous ne serons
plus lŕ physiquement, mais...
on fera toujours partie
de cette nouvelle dynamique.
Qui sait ? Ce sera
peut-ętre mieux.
J'en doute fort.
Ouais, mais s'il y a męme
juste la moindre chance...
Essaies-tu de me dire
que tu ne vas
pas me tuer ?
Je suis désolé,
je ne peux pas.
Je suis enfin
sur une piste.
Et si je continue ŕ creuser,
peut-ętre... je vais peut-ętre
trouver une réponse.
Tu me déçois beaucoup.
Je sais, mais attends,
on est ŕ Oz.
C'est rempli d'assassins.
Tu peux peut-ętre
convaincre quelqu'un d'autre.
Non, non.
C'est pas grave.
J'ai une solution
de remplacement.
A l'appel !
Bordel de merde !
Murphy, amčne-toi ici !
Mets-lui les menottes.
Nom de Dieu.
Putain de bon Dieu.
On dit que les ordures d'un homme
sont le trésor d'un autre.
Comme les poissons
dans la mer,
on prend les rebus des autres
et on leur trouve une utilité.
Brocanteurs, ventes aux enchčres,
on paie bien cher,
fiers d'avoir
déniché un trésor.
Mais quand un ętre aimé meurt,
l'objet le plus stupide,
un porte-clé,
un sweat-shirt déchiré,
devient souvent
trčs spécial.
Une icône ŕ vénérer.
- Vous vouliez me voir ?
- Oui.
Asseyez-vous.
De quoi s'agit-il ?
Vos examens
du mois dernier.
J'ai reçu les résultats
de vos analyses de sang.
Merde.
Vous devriez vous asseoir.
Ne dites rien.
J'ai le SlDA ?
Vous ętes séropositif,
vous n'avez pas
nécessairement le SlDA.
Nom de Dieu !
Le traitement qui existe
pour les séropositifs aujourd'hui
fait des merveilles.
Des milliers de patients
vivent normalement.
Vous m'entendez ?
Promettez de
ne rien dire ŕ personne.
- Personne.
- Non, bien sűr.
Le dossier...
détruisez le dossier.
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Moi si.
Ton déjeuner petit frčre.
C'est du nougat glacé ?
Pas cette fois,
mon vieux.
- Il va bien.
- Ouais.
Il ne réalise toujours pas
qu'il a presque été exécuté.
Pourvu qu'il ne comprenne jamais.
Tout ira bien.
Il ne va pas mourir.
Le tribunal n'a pas
annulé le verdict.
Un juge a accordé
une suspension, c'est tout.
Non.
J'ai prié.
Dieu m'a entendu.
Il a sauvé la vie
de Cyril, vraiment.
Eh, maman,
aie un peu confiance !
D'accord.
Ecoute, connard,
je prépare pas la bouffe.
D'accord ? Je la sers juste.
Ryan.
Si vous avez fini,
j'aimerais vous voir.
Je ne sais pas
si vous savez
que j'étais
le médecin présent
pour l'exécution
de votre frčre.
Non.
J'ai accepté au cas oů Cyril
aurait besoin de soins.
- C'est sympa.
- Puis, alors qu'ils l'attachaient
soudain j'ai pensé
ŕ mon mari...
Et ŕ la mort horrible
qu'il a eue des mains de Cyril
et j'ai pensé "Bien, contente
d'ętre lŕ pour regarder".
Je peux comprendre
ça aussi.
Pas moi.
Vengeance
n'est pas justice.
Je suis médecin.
Je soigne les gens.
Je sauve des vies.
Je ne devrais pas ętre
heureuse au moment de...
de la mort d'une autre
personne, de personne.
Pas męme s'il
a tué mon mari.
Vous savez, j'ai réfléchi,
j'ai vraiment besoin
de faire quelque chose
pour compenser toute...
toute la merde
que j'ai fait.
Et j'aimerais vraiment
venir travailler
ŕ l'hôpital.
Ryan...
Non. Pas pour
ętre prčs de vous.
Pas juste pour ętre
prčs de vous.
Depuis que j'ai lavé
le corps du pčre Meehan,
j'ai...
Je sais pas.
J'ai passé
tellement de temps
ŕ essayer
de survivre, ici ŕ Oz.
Toute mon énergie
s'est concentrée sur ma survie.
Et je suis vachement
doué pour ça.
Alors peut-ętre qu'il est temps
que j'aide d'autres ŕ survivre.
C'est pas de l'arnaque.
Je vous le jure,
sur la tęte de mon frčre.
Je vous crois.
Vraiment ?
J'vais faire le nécessaire.
Merci.
Prisonnier n°° 03P138 :
Seamus O'Riley ;
condamné le 3 février 2003
pour assassinat ;
34 ans de prison
dont 16 fermes.
Papa vient nous voir ?
Il ne vient pas
vraiment pour ça.
Elle a l'air triste,
cette plante.
Elle est supposée survivre
sans lumičre naturelle,
mais, oh, la barbe.
Ecoutez, je suis lŕ
ŕ propos de mon pčre.
- Je ne veux pas de lui ŕ Em City.
- Moi non plus.
- Ah bon ?
- Non.
Je suis venu
pour m'assurer que
vous n'alliez pas essayer
de nous réunir
ou une connerie
dans ce genre.
J'veux pas que ce vieux salaud
s'approche de moi.
- Bienvenue ŕ Oz.
- Va te faire foutre.
Avoir trop
d'ordures n'est rien,
bouteilles, boîtes,
peaux de pastčques,
changes complets et autres.
Ce qui est effrayant
en matičre de santé
de la plančte ŕ long terme,
ce sont les déchets toxiques.
Les déchets toxiques.
On ne peut mettre
pire mots ensemble, sauf...
guerre nucléaire.
"Il aura du sang.
On dit
que le sang
veut du sang.
On a vu les pierres se mouvoir
et les arbres parler.
Les devins, et ceux qui ont
l'intelligence de certains rapports
ont souvent
mis en lumičre...
L'homme de sang
le mieux caché".
C'est trčs bien.
Vous ętes doué.
La comédie consiste souvent
ŕ faire croire un mensonge.
- Alors j'ai le rôle ?
- Bien sűr.
Je suis juste surprise que
vous soyez aussi enthousiaste,
sachant que nous avons eu
tellement de décčs.
Ça prouve que j'ai plus de couilles
que quiconque ici.
Je suis venu
pour l'audition.
Trop tard.
Ouais. J'ai le rôle.
Oh, trčs bien.
Non, attendez. Mon Macduff
a été envoyé en isolement hier,
alors vous voulez
essayer ça ?
Bien sűr.
Lis ça.
C'est le passage oů Macduff
apprend que Macbeth
a tué son épouse
et son fils.
"Coupable Macduff,
ils ont tous été frappés pour toi !
Misérable que je suis,
ce n'est pas pour leurs fautes
mais les miennes
que le meurtre
a fondu sur eux.
Que le ciel maintenant
leur donne la paix".
Comment s'est
passée l'audition ?
Tu as devant toi
le nouveau Macbeth.
Y'a encore des rôles ŕ distribuer.
Tu devrais essayer.
Non, j'aime pas
le maquillage.
Mais j'aime bien
ętre en coulisses.
Je vais aider
avec les accessoires.
Ouah, si seulement
j'avais mon appareil.
Ça vaut une photo.
Barre-toi. On veut
pas te parler.
Tu sais,
tu me surprends vraiment,
ŕ fréquenter
cet enculé.
Aprčs tout il a tué
l'un de tes potes Aryens.
Quoi ?
Franklin Winthrop.
Keller le tueur
lui a tordu le cou.
- Il ment.
- Bien entendu.
Pourquoi Keller voudrait-il
buter Winthrop ?
Il l'a fait pour moi,
par amour,
pour venger
le meurtre de mon pčre.
Garde, garde !
Ça ne te rappelle rien ?
Pauvre con.
Regarde-moi ça.
Je sais encore pleurer.
Tu sais quoi ?
J'en suis fier.
Espčce de pisseuse.
Me dis pas de
me taire, enculé.
T'a bien tué Winthrop.
Ouais.
C'est pas grave.
Il était insignifiant.
Mais Beecher en sait trop
sur nous deux.
Faut qu'il meure.
Ouais.
Je m'en occupe.
Non, j'vais le tuer.
Toi ?
Avant de le buter,
Je veux juste le baiser
dans le cul encore une fois.
Ohé ?
Suzanne m'a dit de te dire
de l'attendre ici.
J'adore les accessoires.
Ce qui semble réel
ne l'est pas.
Comme cette lame.
Ah ! Tu vois.
C'est un faux.
Au moins j'ai ton attention.
J'essaie d'apprendre
mon rôle.
Il parle et pourtant
il ne dit rien. Ça alors ?
La ferme.
Oh, d'accord.
Les actes en disent
plus que les mots.
Celui-lŕ est vrai.
Au fait,
elles sont réelles aussi.
- En retard pour la répétition ?
- Eh.
Non, ça commence
pas avant 15h00.
Vous m'avez écrit
de laisser sortir Beecher
plus tôt pour qu'il
répčte un peu plus.
Je n'ai pas écrit de mot.
C'est l'heure
de te réveiller.
Putain d'enculé !
Comme au bon vieux temps,
hein ? Ma pute.
- Va te faire foutre.
- C'est ça.
Faux... vrai.
Ou bien
je me suis trompé ?
Voyons voir.
J'espčre que
j'ai ton attention maintenant.
Toby.
Schillinger veut
que tu meures.
C'est pas un secret,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je lui ai dit
que je le ferais.
Demande-moi pourquoi.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pour te garder en vie.
C'est vrai.
Je suis copain de cul
avec Schillinger
pour te protéger.
Pour que toi et moi
on connaisse ses plans.
Mais je sais...
quelle tęte
de mule tu fais.
Je savais que
tu ne l'aurais pas cru.
J'ai concocté tout ça
juste pour te convaincre
que j'ai changé.
Si j'étais vraiment du côté
de Schillinger...
tu serais déjŕ mort.
Mais au lieu de ça...
tout ce que
je veux vraiment...
c'est que
tu m'aimes encore.
Putain, qu'est-ce qui
se passe ici ?
Juste un peu de bon temps
entre deux adultes consentants.
Alors Beecher croit
que tu me trahis ?
Cet enculé
ne sait que croire.
J'vais remplir les blancs
au fur et ŕ mesure.
On va lui donner
de quoi pleurer.
Les vieilleries
sont des ordures.
Nous, les américains, nous jetons
400 000 tonnes d'ordures
chaque jour dans
plus de 6000 décharges.
Le problčme c'est que,
alors que la population grandit,
L'espace disponible diminue.
Vous vous souvenez de
cette péniche
errante parce que
personne ne voulait de
son chargement en décrépitude ?
Imaginez un futur
rempli de bateaux
débordants de
détritus puants,
et essayant
de trouver un port.
Comment ça s'est passé ?
Ils ont refusé
ma liberté conditionnelle.
Ouais, ma femme et moi, on va prendre
notre retraite ŕ Sarasota en Floride.
- Sympa.
- Je peux vous voir un instant ?
Bien sűr, euh...
- On vous attend ŕ l'entrée.
- D'accord.
Euh, Miguel Alvarez,
- je veux que vous le rencontriez.
- Pourquoi ?
Pour qu'il vous présente
ses excuses
pour vous avoir frappé
l'autre fois.
C'est en rapport
avec ma promotion
prochaine ŕ la tęte
de la commission ?
Non, c'est en rapport
avec un type
qui fait une véritable
tentative de réhabilitation.
Ecoutez, je vois Miguel
tous les jours.
Vous le voyez une fois
tous les trois ans.
Je crois qu'il a changé.
Donnez-lui une chance
de vous le prouver.
- Je vais y réfléchir.
- Je vous en prie !
Je vais y réfléchir.
Il a dit non ?
Il a dit peut-ętre.
C'est déjŕ ça.
Le secret, c'est de rester
sur la bonne voie.
Evite les mauvaises influences.
- J'essaie.
- Je sais.
- C'est vachement dur.
- Je sais.
Salut.
Salut, Cathy Jo.
Comment vas-tu ?
J'irai mieux quand
on aura fini ces légalités.
D'aprčs l'avocat,
quand tu auras signé ça,
toute la propriété
de Wolfgang sera ŕ moi.
Tu es belle.
Merci.
Tu sais, je... je ne connaissais
pas bien Cutler,
mais ça doit ętre un crétin
pour te traiter
comme il l'a fait.
Si c'était moi,
je serais ŕ tes pieds.
Bon, on devrait
s'occuper de ça.
Mais aprčs tout,
y'a pas le feu.
C'est vrai.
Pas le feu du tout.
Il paraît que Cathy Jo
est revenue te voir.
T'as signé le transfert
de propriété ?
Pas exactement.
C'est oui ou non.
Ou pas exactement.
Elle n'est pas sure de tout vouloir.
- Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
- Je sais pas.
Il lui faut plus de temps.
Je lui en donne.
Bon, tâche d'en finir.
Je fais juste ce que la veuve veut.
C'est ce que tu voulais.
Bon Dieu,
faut vous calmer.
J'ai pas confiance
en ce métčque.
A sa prochaine visite,
j'veux un espion dans la pičce.
Je crois que j'ai pas
confiance en elle, non plus.
Prisonnier n°° 03T323 :

Putain, c'est qui ça ?
C'est Torquemada,
patron d'une boîte.
Le roi de la nuit.
Miguel Alvarez.
Paraît que t'es
l'homme ŕ connaître.
Celui qui
t'a dit ça est un idiot.
Non, merci.
Je déteste l'héro.
J'te parle pas
de cette merde, chéri.
J'te parle de la nouveauté
en synthétiques.
T'as déjŕ pris
de la destinée ?
En cachets.
C'est comme une fiesta
qui dure six mois.
Je passe devant la commission
de contrôle dans deux.
J'vais garder mon dossier
et ma tęte bien nets.
Tu me plais.
T'es malin.
Tu pourrais ętre
mon numéro deux.
C'est drôle.
A la tęte des travelos ?
Oh, non.
Je vais diriger
tout Em City.
Tu veux Em City ?
Tu vas battre
les ritals, les nčgres ?
C'est exact.
T'as pris trop
de cachets, baby.
Crois-moi,
quand ils auront mis
la main sur cette merde...
chaque prisonnier
d'Oz sera ŕ moi.
"Junk" signifie aussi
les stupéfiants en argot,
en principe de l'héroďne.
Ceux qui en prennent
sont des "junkies",
et il en résulte que des vies
peuvent ętre détruites.
Les "Junk bonds" ou obligations
ŕ risques causent des ruines.
La "Junk food" ou les cochonneries,
une mauvaise nutrition.
Le "Junk mail", ou les prospectus,
sont énervants.
Nos vies sont
pleines de merde.
Mais la plus difficile
ŕ nettoyer
est celle que nous
faisons nous-męmes.
Yood.
Une fois encore,
et je veux la vérité.
As-tu vu qui
a tué Willy Brandt ?
Non.
Tu étais dans le secteur.
Comment n'aurais-tu pas
pu le remarquer ?
J'ai vu ce que j'ai vu.
Ce que je dirai,
c'est une autre affaire.
Je pourrais t'y forcer.
Directeur,
je sais trčs bien que
ce qui s'est passé ici
n'est que le bout
de la queue d'un dragon.
Je vous conseille d'oublier
le tueur de Willy Brandt
et celui du maire Loewen.
Oubliez ça
avant que le dragon
ne vienne
vous mordre le cul.
Agent Johnson,
que puis-je faire pour vous ?
- Un autre travail.
- Oh, merde.
Le dernier.
Vous avez dit ça
pour Willy Brandt.
Brandt c'était rien
ŕ côté de ça.
Ouais ? Qui ?
Bon sang.
Devine quoi j'ai appris
qui va recevoir le prix d'honneur
de l'association
des gardiens de prison
ŕ la réception de ce soir.
Pour 34 ans de bons et loyaux services,
son courage et son calme,
Le prix d'honneur
revient ŕ Leo Glynn.
Félicitations.
Personne ne le mérite
plus que toi.
Ouais, c'est ça.
Tu sais aussi bien que moi
que le seul critčre
pour ce prix
c'est la survie.
Ooh, faut qu'on
te détende avant ce soir.
Je vais pas me détendre
tant que l'assassin de Loewen
ne sera pas derričre les barreaux.
Brandt a tué Loewen
et maintenant Brandt est mort.
Il est mort parce qu'on
ne voulait pas qu'il témoigne
et dise qui l'avait payé
pour tuer Loewen.
Eh, Leo, j'ai quelques questions...
Ouah.
Revenez ici.
La derničre fois
oů je l'ai porté...
c'était pour tes 40 ans.
Merde, merci de me le rappeler.
J'étais pas assez malade.
Je vais peut-ętre
y aller maintenant,
m'en jeter un ou deux
avant tous les discours.
Hein ?
Il paraît que Leo va recevoir
un prix d'honneur.
Tu sais que ça commence
dans une demi-heure ?
Ouais.
Alors quel est le problčme ?
Tu veux que
je t'aide ŕ t'habiller ?
Viens lŕ.
Je crois qu'il va y avoir
des problčmes ŕ Em City.
Ouais, mais pas plus
que d'habitude.
Ouais, mais je devrais
peut-ętre rester ici,
au cas oů.
Tu ne veux pas y aller ?
Ben, qu'est-ce
que t'en penses ?
Tu dois vraiment
aimer ton travail
ou détester ton patron.
A l'appel !
J'vais faire la fęte.

on ne devrait

Pas sans Leo.
- Ouais, oů est-il ?
- Je vais le chercher.
Tu devrais ralentir.
Oh, bon sang.
Leo ?
Leo ?
Leo ?
Bon Dieu.
Leo !
Agent, sonnez l'alarme !
Arrętez la musique !
Arrętez cette
putain de musique !
Amenez le brancard !
Leo, tu m'entends ?
Je ne trouve pas de pouls.
Oh, mon Dieu,
il est mort.
Tu sais comment sortir
d'un labyrinthe ?
Non, Tim.
Je sais pas.
A la seconde
oů tu y entres,
tu mets la main
sur le mur
et tu te mets ŕ marcher.
Si tu gardes
la main sur le mur,
tu arriveras ŕ sortir.
Mais ce labyrinthe,
celui que j'ai dessiné,
il n'a pas de murs.
Je ne comprends pas pourquoi
le fait que toi et Leo
soyez ensemble
m'ennuyait tellement.
L'idée de notre divorce
était bien que nous soyons
heureux tous les deux, non ?
Maintenant aucun
de nous ne l'est.
Tu sais ce qui me manque
le plus de notre mariage ?
Tu savais toujours
comment me consoler.
Je l'aimais tellement.
D'aprčs les statistiques
du département
de la justice américaine,
La population carcérale
a augmenté
de presque 550 000

C'est une augmentation de 69%.
Dépotoir, prison,
męme chose.
Seulement en prison, les ordures
dont nous nous débarrassons,
Les laissés pour compte,
ce sont des vies humaines.
La Sainte Bible
Mon Combat
Je suis innocent.
Je suis innocent.
Je suis innocent !
Innocent.
Moi aussi, je suis innocent.
Je suis innocent.
N'importe quel type,
dans n'importe quelle prison
vous dira qu'il est innocent.
"C'est une erreur judiciaire.
J'avais un mauvais avocat.
J'étais à Tolède,
chez ma mère".
Ouais. Vous entendrez
un tas de bobards.
Mais celui qui dit la vérité,
celui qui est vraiment innocent ?
Sa voix est tellement couverte
par celles des autres
qu'il finira enroué
avant de s'être fait entendre.
Leo !
Leo Glynn est mort.
Désolée,
j'ai pas encore réalisé.
J'ai des remords,
tu sais ?
On s'était fâchés, récemment.
On avait tous
nos désaccords avec Leo.
Mais malgré tout, c'était le meilleur
homme pour le pire des boulots.
Amen.
J'ai parlé à son ex-femme
au cimetière.
Sa fille et elle ne voulaient
pas venir jusqu'ici...
Je rassemble
les affaires de Leo.
J'ignore si elle était au courant
de ma relation avec lui.
Marie savait.
Elle a dit qu'elle était heureuse
que Leo ait quelqu'un.
Elle détestait l'idée de le savoir
seul après leur divorce.
Tim, j'ai parlé
au gouverneur
pour qu'il vous
nomme directeur.
Devlin a dû faire un bond.
Il n'a pas dit non.
Peu importe,
je ne veux pas le poste.
Il faut quelqu'un de fort
et sensible ici, Tim.
C'est vous.
Stanton a des choses
intéressantes à dire.
Lionel Kelsch
a tué le directeur...
Ainsi que Willy Brandt.
Et avant ça, il a aidé Brandt
à liquider Loewen, le maire.
Comment sais-tu ça ?
Kelsch est un vantard,
je hais les vantards !
Emmenez Stanton
en cellule de protection.
Mettez Kelsch au trou.
D'accord !
- T'as déjà été au trou, Kelsch ?
- Non.
D'abord, t'es à poil,
il fait froid.
Ensuite, tu pisses
et tu chies dans un seau.
Et pire que tout, t'es seul,
complètement seul,
24 heures par jour.
Sauf pour les repas, non ?
Quand tu vois les matons ?
En théorie.
Mais tu vois,
les gars, parfois,
oublient d'apporter
la nourriture...
Surtout aux types accusés
d'avoir tué quelqu'un qu'ils respectent.
- Hmm.
- A poil.
McManus, attendez !
C'est quoi mes options ?
Donne-moi le nom
du type qui t'a engagé.
L'éloge de Glynn par le gouverneur
était vraiment touchant.
Vraiment ?
J'ai dû m'assoupir.
Pourquoi McManus
veut-il me voir ?
Il m'a juste demandé
de te chercher.
- C'est le prochain directeur ?
- On sait jamais.
Soyez pas timide,
agent Johnson.
Je vais vous lire
vos droits.
Avant qu'ils t'emmènent
au QG de la police,
dis-moi pourquoi.
Pourquoi avoir
embauché Brandt, hein ?
A cause des petites filles ?
Je dirai rien avant
d'avoir vu un avocat
et d'avoir passé un marché
avec le procureur.
Leo te faisait confiance !
- Emmenons-le.
- Allez-y.
Tim.
Vous vous souvenez,
il y a cinq ans,
quand vous avez annoncé
de cette estrade
que je supprimais
tous les programmes
de lycée et
d'équivalence universitaire ?
Je vais faire un discours
sur l'éducation,
disant que c'est le dernier
espoir pour les détenus,
et je nommerai le nouveau
programme d'après Leo Glynn.
Les temps ont changé.
C'est peut-être moi
qui me suis adoucit.
L'inspecteur Tarnowski
vient de nous appeler.
Adrian Johnson
a mis en cause Perry
dans les meurtres de Loewen,
Brandt et Leo.
Quoi ?
Vous êtes le prochain, Devlin.
- Gouverneur, nous devons...
- La ferme, Perry.
Annulez la conférence
de presse.
Retournons à la résidence.
Ces accusations
sont une insulte.
Une tentative d'attaquer
un jeune homme prometteur.
Qui est à deux doigts
de se faire enculer,
à moins de passer un accord.
- Eh, j'ai juste...
- Le ferme !
- Je vais régler ça.
- Comment ?
Que pouvez-vous faire,
à part donner votre démission ?
Vous savez
ce qu'il y a de drôle ?
C'est que c'est Wilson Loewen
qui vous a fait élire !
Et maintenant, c'est son fantôme
qui provoquera votre chute.
J'espère que quand
vous irez en prison,
on vous enverra ici, à Oz.
Ellie, vous venez ?
Non, espèce
de sale petit enfoiré.
J'accepte votre démission.
- La vôtre aussi, McManus.
- Je ne partirai pas.
On verra ça !
Perry !
Merci à vous tous
d'être venus.
Le décès prématuré
de Leo Glynn
- a laissé un vide à Oswald...
- Laissez tomber le discours.
Qui est notre nouveau patron ?
D'accord.
Certains d'entre vous le connaissent,
il a déjà travaillé ici.
- Oh, non.
- Récemment, il a fait un bon boulot
à Lardner... Martin Querns.
Salut, tout le monde.
Je suis de retour.
Tim McManus...
Venez me voir.
J'ignore ce que vous avez fait
pour énerver le gouverneur
mais il veut voir votre tête
plantée sur un pieu
au sommet de la tour nord.
- Je suis viré, alors.
- Avec un mois de préavis.
Fabuleux.
Il peut se passer plein
de choses en un mois.
Cette affaire de meurtre
pourrait sonner le glas
de la carrière de Devlin.
J'en doute.
Il s'est déjà sorti
de guêpiers pires que celui-là.
Comme je disais,
on verra bien.
Bien sûr, s'il s'en va,
peut-être que
vous n'aurez pas à partir.
Je ne mentais pas en disant
que j'était un fan
du concept de Em City.
Il t'a viré ?
Je n'en suis pas sûr.
Ma sœur.
Ramenez vos miches.
Ceci est
une chaise de détention.
Elle sera dans le trou.
Si vous désobéissez,
on vous mettra dessus.
Je voulais que
vous voyiez ce monstre
pour que vous sachiez que
je me ferai emmerder par personne.
Alors, n'oubliez pas...
Faites pas chier Querns.
Ceci est une histoire vraie.
Mariano Absun s'est échappé
du Centre de Détention de Connor,
à Hominy, dans l'Oklahoma,
en se cachant à l'arrière
d'un camion poubelle.
Son corps fut retrouvé
deux heures plus tard,
écrabouillé parmi les ordures.
Absun n'avait été condamné
qu'à trois ans fermes.
Trois ans.
Mais il a pas pu le supporter
et a essayé de se faire la belle.
Bob, t'arrives pas à dormir ?
Non.
C'est le meilleur moment...
Quand tout est calme,
quand tout
est encore possible.
C'est aujourd'hui que Stella
revient après son opération.
- Tu es excité, alors.
- Et effrayé.
Avant qu'elle
entre à l'hôpital
j'ai dit à Stella
que je l'aimais.
Bob, vieux chien de mer.
Mais elle a dit
que c'était pas vrai...
Ce qui signifie
qu'elle ne m'aime pas.
Stella ?
J'ai eu tes fleurs.
- Oh.
- Je t'ai fait mal ?
Non.
Je n'ai pas encore l'habitude
de mon nouveau sein.
Je vois pas la différence.
Dieu seul peut faire les arbres...
Mais heureusement,
I'homme peut
réparer tout le reste.
Il y a des problèmes ?
J'ai des problèmes de mémoire
à cause des médicaments.
Si je me mets à radoter
ou si j'oublie un nom,
pardonne-moi.
Non, c'est à toi
de me pardonner
d'avoir été assez
stupide pour penser
que nous partagions
les mêmes sentiments.
Les mêmes sentiments ?
Je ne sais pas.
Mais je t'aime vraiment,
Robert...
A ma façon.
C'est une question
de perspectives.
"Voir un monde
dans un grain de sable
Et le paradis
dans une fleur sauvage..."
"Retenir l'infini dans
la paume de ta main
Et l'éternité dans une heure."
Mme Coffo !
"Adseg" est une zone interdite.
Je veux voir Pablo Rosa.
Il n'a pas le droit aux visites.
Mais je travaille ici.
C'est le règlement.
Comment faire pour changer
le règlement juste une fois ?
Je ne sais pas.
- Allez voir un de mes supérieurs.
- Qui ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il joue les durs,
mais ce n'en est pas un.
Pablo n'est
qu'un gosse terrorisé.
J'ai peur de
ce qui lui passe par la tête,
tout seul,
dans ce trou du diable.
Qu'aimerais-tu faire ?
J'aimerais au moins
lui procurer des livres.
Ils ne le laisseront jamais
avoir des livres au trou.
Mais il y a toujours
un moyen de se débrouiller.
Tu as du cash sur toi ?
Pablo, tu m'entends ?
Mme C. ?
Vous allez bien ?
Ça va.
Et toi ?
J'ai l'impression
de devenir dingue.
Eh bien...
je suis ici pour t'aider.
Comment ?
Je vais te lire
"Les Aventures de Tom Sawyer".
Chapitre premier.
"Tom joue, se bat,
et se cache.
Tom !
Pas de réponse.
Tom !
Pas de réponse.
Je me demande
ce que fait ce garçon.
Tom, où es-tu ?
La vielle femme
baissa ses lunettes
et regarda dans la pièce.
Puis elle les releva
et regarda par en dessous.
Elle ne regardait jamais
au travers de ses lunettes
quand elle cherchait
un enfant."
Norma est revenue
me voir avec le bébé.
C'est formidable d'être père.
Je ne peux pas savoir.
Comment ça ?
Tu as eu Alex.
Mais je ne l'ai pas élevé.
Il ne savait même pas
que j'existais avant d'être adulte.
Je n'ai jamais été
un père pour mon fils.
Moi j'ai Ruby,
qui n'est pas de moi
mais que j'aiderai à élever.
J'aimerais un jour
avoir un enfant à moi.
Un enfant que j'aurais conçu.
Agamemnon, je t'en prie.
Je viens de manger.
J'imagine que c'est sans espoir,
sans visites conjugales.
Et quand je sortirai,
Norma sera trop vieille
pour avoir un enfant.
Il y a des alternatives.
L'insémination artificielle,
par exemple.
Bien sûr,
je pourrais me branler
et envoyer mon sperme
à Norma en express.
Bob, tu es un génie !
Le préfet a dit non.
Non ?
Comment peut-il dire non ?
Il ne veut pas déclencher
une avalanche de demandes
d'inséminations artificielles.
Il dit que ça expose
l'Etat à des risques
sécuritaires et légaux.
Mais j'ai le droit de procréer.
Pas nécessairement.
La Cour Suprême des Etats-Unis
garantit à un prisonnier
Le droit de se marier
et de ne pas se faire stériliser.
Mais les juges
ne se sont jamais prononcés
sur leur droit
d'avoir des enfants.
- Que pouvons-nous faire ?
- Nous ? Rien.
Vous devriez contacter l'Association
de Défense des Détenus,
pour qu'ils vous trouvent
un avocat.
Je vais le faire.
J'ai peut-être enfreint la loi
mais je suis encore un homme.
C'est vrai mais, Busmalis,
tous les hommes ne sont pas
obligés de devenir pères.
Chaque homme devrait
avoir le droit de choisir.
Oh là...
Vas-y mollo, Agamemnon.
Tu as l'air
d'une tâche d'huile.
Tu as raison...
Je suis nerveux.
Le panel judiciaire
se réunit aujourd'hui
pour décider
si je peux inséminer Norma.
S'ils disent oui,
je pourrais être père à Noël.
Tu en as parlé
avec le Dr Nathan ?
C'est une procédure
coûteuse et longue
qui a un fort taux d'échec.
Pourquoi essayes-tu toujours
de me décourager ?
Parce que tu fais toujours
les choses sans réfléchir,
et tu finis le cœur brisé.
C'est pas vrai.
OK, peut-être que c'est vrai.
Mais à Oz, Bob,
c'est tout ce qu'on a...
Des espoirs et des rêves.
Ayant examiné les arguments
et les témoignages
nous avons pris
la décision suivante :
Puisque l'Etat a le droit
d'interdire les visites conjugales,
appliquer des limitations
à l'insémination artificielle
n'est pas déraisonnable.
Même si nous reconnaissons
que la procréation
est un droit fondamental,
La raison d'être
d'une peine de prison
est la privation
de droits fondamentaux.
Par conséquent, nous rejetons
la demande du plaignant.
On a perdu ?
Je le crains.
On va faire appel.
Non, je suis désolé.
On peut pas faire appel.
Retourne dans ta cage,
Busmalis.
Non.
Ne cause pas d'ennuis.
Attends, espèce de bâtard !
C'est de ma vie qu'il s'agit,
de ma vie !
- Recule !
- Espèce d'enculé !
- Aidez-moi !
- Je vais te tuer, fils de pute !
Mais c'est injuste !
C'est pas juste !
C'est pas juste !
Bonjour.
C'est quoi son problème ?
Claire me demandais mon avis.
Elle est malade ?
Elle est enceinte.
Vous vouliez me voir,
mon Père ?
Oui, entrez.
Asseyez-vous.
De quoi s'agit-il ?
Vous êtes enceinte.
Je ne veux pas m'immiscer
dans quoi que ce soit.
Je veux que vous sachiez
que si vous voulez en parler...
Ce que je vous dirai
restera entre nous ?
Je pourrais
perdre mon boulot.
C'est promis.
Mes rapports avec les hommes
sont catastrophiques,
et pourtant je suis constamment
en contact avec eux.
C'est pour cela que...
Mon père, depuis que je suis à Oz
j'ai baisé avec beaucoup d'hommes.
Ouais !
Beaucoup de détenus.
- Vous êtes choqué.
- D'une certaine façon, oui.
Mais en fait, non.
Et maintenant, je suis
enceinte de l'un d'eux.
Vous savez qui est le père ?
Je dirais que le bébé
sera café au lait
et qu'il aura mariné
dans de la salsa...
Ça signifie que
je ne pourrai pas l'élever
dans mon quartier de blancs.
J'ai pas les moyens
de déménager.
Et même si je pouvais,
où pourrais-je aller ?
A Little Havana ?
Je suis baisée.
Claire, si vous
pensez avorter...
Gardez votre salive,
mon Père.
Il n'y a pas que les Catholiques
qui sont contre l'avortement.
Qu'allez-vous faire, alors ?
Demander un congé,
pondre le chiard...
Et à partir de maintenant,
garder les jambes croisées.
Je ne serai jamais papa.
A chacun ses problèmes.
Ceci est une histoire vraie.
Dans le Vermont,
un détenu a été pris en entrant
par effraction dans la prison.
A l'évidence, il s'était enfui
de son camp de travail,
était allé à l'épicerie du coin,
avait acheté un pack de bière
et une cartouche de cigarette,
et passait sous le grillage
quand il fut arrêté
par les matons.
Il a pris six mois de plus.
Et le pauvre enfoiré
n'a même pas pu
garder la bière.
C'est dingue, non ?
OK, levez les bras.
Tournez-vous.
Passez là-dessous.
Jackson Vahue,
bienvenue à Oz.
C'est pas ma première visite,
M. Le Directeur.
Je sais.
Depuis que j'ai été libéré,
j'essaye de dire aux autres
de ne pas commettre mes erreurs...
Je parle aux gamins,
aux membres des gangs, tout ça.
Heureux que vous
soyez venu pour ça.
Les jeunes détenus admirent
les joueurs de basket.
J'espère qu'ils écouteront
ce que vous avez à dire.
Après vous.
En conclusion,
je vous demande de tirer
profit de votre détention.
Avec un peu de chance,
vous pourrez
vous faire une autre vie...
Et vous casser de Oz.
Je peux avoir un autographe ?
Agent Brass, vous traînez
toujours dans ces couloirs ?
Ouais. Tout le monde
n'a pas ta chance.
J'ai rien à voir avec ceux
qui t'ont coupé le tendon.
Oh, je sais.
J'ai pris un abonnement
pour les Knights, cette saison.
- Je serai là à chaque match.
- Ouais.
Je pourrais peut-être venir
te voir dans les vestiaires,
rencontrer les autres joueurs,
tout ça...
Non, je ne crois pas.
OK, d'accord.
J'ai une question, Jackson.
Quand tu joues comme ça,
sur le terrain,
tous ces regards posés sur toi,
ça te fait pas réfléchir ?
Réfléchir à quoi ?
A ceux qui te regardent ?
Y'a plein de malades
dans ce monde, mec.
Non, j'ai pas peur.
Tu les as bien accrochées,
mon pote.
Content de t'avoir revu.
Salut, les gars.
A plus, mec.
Dave !
Sean, tu m'as fait louper.
Parfois je me demande
si je voulais passer pro
parce que j'aimais ce sport,
ou parce que je voulais que
tout le monde me voit jouer.
Etre adulé par la foule.
Le fric, les femmes...
tout le toutim, hein ?
Je me fous de
ces petits avantages.
Je veux être connu.
Je veux pas devenir
un vieux maton tout croulant.
Je veux pas disparaître.
Qu'est-ce que tu peux faire ?
Tu joues avec les cartes
que t'as en main.
Je sais que tu as fait
ce qu'il fallait faire avec Morales.
Je veux te dire
que je t'admire.
Je t'ai toujours admiré.
Sans rancune, hein ?
Pourquoi j'ai l'impression
que tu me dis adieu ?
C'est ce que je fais.
J'ai pris ma décision...
J'arrête.
Pour faire quoi ?
Mélanger les cartes,
avoir une nouvelle donne.
On vient d'apprendre que
la star du basket Jackson Vahue,
s'est fait tiré dessus
cet après-midi
pendant l'entraînement.
L'agresseur, David Brass,
était gardien à la prison d'Oswald...
Agent Murphy ?
Vahue a été emprisonné à Oswald
et dit qu'il connaissait à peine Brass,
même s'ils ont joué un match
l'un contre l'autre en prison.
T'es passé de l'autre côté.
Ceci est une histoire vraie.
Le juge d'une cour
municipale au Texas
a été reconnu coupable
d'agressions sexuelles.
Il exigeait
des faveurs sexuelles
des membres féminins
de la famille des accusés
en échange
d'une caution plus basse
ou d'une libération provisoire.
Quand on est chaud,
on est chaud.
M. Hoyt, merci d'être
venu nous voir.
- Je suis le père Mukada.
- Comment allez-vous ?
Oh, et voici
la Sœur Peter Marie.
Pardon.
Ravie de vous rencontrer.
Comment allez-vous ?
C'est mon...
C'est la première fois
que je visite une prison.
Vous n'êtes jamais
venu voir Jaz ?
Non.
Je ne sais pas ce que
vous attendez de moi au juste.
Nous pensons que
pour que Jaz aille mieux,
il a besoin d'être confronté
à certains problèmes émotionnels.
Oui.
Vous ne pouvez pas
reprocher à Evangeline et moi
ce qu'est devenu ce garçon.
On était de bons parents.
On s'est pas contenté
de lui donner des choses.
On lui a donné de l'amour,
plein d'amour.
Mais il y avait toujours
quelque chose qui n'allait pas,
et cela depuis le jour
où on l'a ramené
chez nous de l'orphelinat.
Jaz est adopté ?
Oui, ma femme et moi
ne pouvions pas avoir d'enfants.
On en a adopté trois.
Avez-vous essayé
de savoir qui étaient
Les vrais parents de Jaz ?
Oui, son père
est mort en prison.
Sa mère vivait à Morrisville.
J'ignore si elle habite
encore là-bas.
J'aimerais avoir
les informations que vous avez
- sur les vrais parents de Jaz.
- Bien sûr.
Buvez votre jus.
- Non.
- Buvez votre jus.
- Non !
- Buvez votre putain de jus.
Non, salope !
Fous le camp !
Jessica, l'une des choses les plus
dures quand on travaille à Oz
est de distinguer l'homme
et le crime qu'il a commis.
Si vous n'y arrivez pas,
même avec Jaz Hoyt,
vous n'êtes pas
à votre place.
Je suis désolée.
Vous avez raison,
comme d'habitude.
J'aimerais me rattraper.
Vous êtes libre pour déjeuner ?
Non, en fait.
Je suis en train d'essayer de
localiser la mère biologique de Hoyt.
Pourquoi ?
Je veux savoir d'où il vient.
Pour le sauver ?
Eh bien, oui.
Vous êtes
un homme remarquable, Ray.
Vous êtes un saint.
Loin de là.
Si vous pouvez pas déjeuner,
on pourrait dîner ensemble ?
Je fais un excellent poulet rôti.
Je n'accepterai pas
votre refus.
D'accord, alors, avec plaisir.
Super.
19h30 ?
Il n'avait qu'un jour quand
on l'a laissé aux services sociaux.
Mon petit ami venait
d'être envoyé en prison
et mes parents pensaient que
je devais avoir une nouvelle chance.
Buster était un vrai salaud.
Excusez-moi, mon Père,
mais c'était un salopard.
Mon mari, John...
C'est un homme bon et gentil.
Je dois vous dire que je suis très
nerveuse à l'idée de voir mon fils.
J'ai même failli
vous appeler pour annuler.
Je serai constamment
à vos côtés.
Merci.
Mme Oppenheimer,
Jaz est dans un état mental
extrêmement volatile.
Il risque de dire
d'horribles choses.
Je n'ai aucune attente,
mon Père.
J'espère juste que...
J'espère que ma visite aidera
mon fils à savoir qui il est.
Vous êtes prêt, Jaz ?
Ouais.
- Bonjour.
- Maman.
Bonjour.
On se verra
demain à midi, alors.
Parfait.
Merci pour tout.
OK, au revoir.
Vous travaillez tard ?
Oui.
J'ai essayé de faire
ce que vous avez dit...
Distinguer l'homme
de son crime.
Mais je vois Hoyt tous les jours
à l'hôpital de la prison
et c'est difficile de faire
la différence entre les deux.
Il y a de nombreux endroits
qui cherchent
des infirmières qualifiées.
- Je pourrais vous aider...
- Mais on ne se verrait plus.
Je ne suis certainement pas
la seule raison de votre venue à Oz.
Pas la seule raison, non...
Mais j'ai tellement peu
d'amis proches.
Laissez-moi vous aider.
S'il vous plaît, arrêtez.
Arrêter quoi ?
Arrêtez de me toucher.
Oh, je suis désolée.
C'est moi qui suis désolé de ne pas
pouvoir être plus pour vous.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
J'ai fait vœu de chasteté.
De chas...
Vous...
Comment osez-vous !
Je suis une bonne catholique.
Je l'ai été toute ma vie !
- Ce n'est pas ce que...
- Comment osez-vous penser ça !
Mon fils avait raison,
vous n'êtes qu'un sale
bâtard aux yeux bridés !
Fais quelque chose pour moi.
Tue Timmy Kirk.
Ray, Ray.
- Quoi ?
- Ecoute ça.
Après le départ de sa mère,
Jaz Hoyt s'est confié à moi.
Il m'a dit que c'était
le révérend Cloutier
qui lui avait ordonné de tuer
Timmy Kirk la première fois.
Comment est-ce possible ?
Il était chez les grands brûlés.
Il était incapable de parler.
Il dit que Cloutier
est apparu dans sa cellule,
et qu'il avait l'air
parfaitement normal.
Une apparition ?
Après, quand on l'a mis
à l'isolement,
ses copains bikers
ont décidé de se venger.
Ils ont été chercher Cloutier
et l'ont emmené.
Où ça ?
Hoyt dit que c'est une chose
qu'il ne dira qu'à toi.
Où ont-ils emmené
le révérend Cloutier ?
Si je vous le dis,
Les autre bikers
nous tueront tous les deux.
Hoyt, je dois savoir.
OK.
Ceci est une histoire vraie.
Un détenu de la prison
de Muskegon, dans le Michigan,
a agressé sexuellement
la fille de trois ans
d'une femme
qui lui rendait visite.
En conséquence, l'administration
pénitentiaire mit en place
Les mesures les plus
restrictives du pays
pour les visites aux détenus,
interdisant
aux mineurs de venir,
même à leurs enfants.
Vous voyez,
la connerie d'un seul
a foutu en l'air
le bonheur de tous.
Redding,
je dois te parler.
J'ai des remords
d'avoir menti à mes frères,
de leur avoir dit
que la machine à relier
avait été détruite par accident.
Tu as eu ton chèque
de l'assurance ?
Tout le monde n'a pas
perdu d'argent, alors,
ce qui aurait été le cas
si la compagnie s'était retirée.
Ce n'est pas
une question d'argent.
Tu as commis un crime
et j'en ai tiré profit.
Je dois faire quelque chose.
Quoi que tu fasses,
ça détruira ta réputation
vis à vis de tes frères.
Tu peux vivre avec ça ?
Tu vas me dire
ce qui s'est passé ?
J'allais venir vous voir.
Pour tout avouer.
Je suis tout ouïe,
comme on dit.
L'accident qui a détruit
la machine à relier...
C'était pas un accident.
C'est Burr Redding
le responsable.
Pourquoi parler maintenant ?
Parce que je me sens coupable.
J'ai déshonoré la mémoire
de Kareem Said.
Chaque nuit quand je prie,
Les mots semblent
de plus en plus creux.
Mon âme est en péril.
Je dois te punir.
Gardien.
Ramenez-le à Em City,
mettez-le dans la cage.
J'ignore de quoi
vous parlez, McManus.
J'ai jamais approché
cette machine à relier.
Arif dit que vous avez
envoyé quelqu'un.
Arif dit n'importe quoi !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Vous allez devoir trouver
quelqu'un d'autre, Donna.
Redding va prendre
sa retraite à l'isolement.
- Vous n'avez pas de preuve.
- La parole d'Arif me suffit.
Sortez-le de là.
Tim...
Je viens de signer un contrat
avec une grosse
maison de presse.
- J'ai besoin de Burr.
- Désolé.
- On peut pas faire un marché ?
- Non, pas de marché !
Pas question de négocier,
on est à Oz !
Ceci est une histoire vraie.
L'administration pénitentiaire
du Wisconsin a interdit tout matériel
sexuellement explicite
reçu par les détenus.
Ceci inclus le numéro spécial maillots
de bain de "Sports lllustrated",
Les magazines "Vanity Fair",
"Maxim" et "Rolling Stone",
ainsi que des magazines
de moto et de musculation.
Interdit également, une photo
des peintures de la chapelle Sixtine
par Michel Ange.
L'administration pénitentiaire
craignait que les nus
qui ornent les plafonds
du Vatican
pourraient, je cite :
"Nuire à la réhabilitation".
Chucky.
- Salut.
- T'as passé ton coup fil ?
- Ouais, je les ai appelés.
- Et notre ami commun ?
Il a donné son feu vert.
Tu sais, Angelo et moi avons
beaucoup bossé ensemble.
En fait, dans chaque club
que j'ai ouvert,
ton neveu était
mon partenaire silencieux.
J'ai pas l'intention
d'être silencieux.
Tu dois te détendre,
mon grand.
T'as déjà pris du "D" ?
C'est moi qui régale.
Passe-le à tes hommes.
Tu vois, Chulo,
c'est simple comme bonjour,
"appelle-moi un rital".
Ça ira.
Où t'as eu ça ?
Torquemada me l'a filé.
T'as déjà été
dans une de ses boîtes ?
Non.
Ils m'ont jamais laisser entrer.
Non.
Vas-y mollo avec ça, mec.
Je suis allé
chez Dino, une fois.
L'éclairage,
Le son...
Et les femmes.
Yo, Chico,
calme-toi, mec.
Les gardiens vont te foutre
dans la chaise de confinement.
Torquemada dit
qu'il va filer du destiny
à ces putains
de matons aussi, mec !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Que se passe-t-il, mec ?
Où suis-je ?
Oh, merde !
Ça va aller.
Me touche pas !
Me touche pas, non !
Enlevez ça !
Enlevez-moi ça !
Yo !
Mettez-le sous perf, vite.
C'est une fouille !
T'as l'air déprimé.
Ouais.
Un type
a fait une overdose.
Un ami proche ?
Tu sais, à Oz,
t'as pas d'amis.
Y'a que des gens
qui te ressemblent.
Wolfgang avait les Aryens,
et moi...
J'ai surtout été seul.
Moi aussi.
C'est marrant, j'avais peur
quand je venais voir Wolfgang,
mais plus maintenant.
Joyeux Noël,
fils de pute !
C'est la dernière fois
que tu vois Cathy Jo Cutler.
On est en train
de lui expliquer.
Si vous la touchez...
Quoi ? Tes copains latinos camés
vont s'en prendre à moi ?
Non, non.
C'est entre toi et moi.
Et risquer ta conditionnelle,
pour une pauvre connasse
qui sait pas
où est sa place ?
J'ai eu une prise de bec
avec les Aryens.
- On s'est expliqué.
- Je vois ça.
Je sais que vous allez
vouloir m'aider McManus,
mais ça serait mieux
pour moi et ma conditionnelle
si cet incident
n'était jamais arrivé.
Miguel...
Ecoutez, la raison
de cette bagarre
ne reviendra pas.
Schillinger s'occupe de ça.
Quoi que vous fassiez,
ça empirera les choses.
OK.
La bonne nouvelle est que
Luis Ruiz a accepté de te voir.
Comment vous avez fait ?
Comme tout le reste,
en insistant.
Aïe.
T'as l'air de souffrir, bébé.
Ça va.
J'ai une nouvelle cargaison
de "D" qui arrive aujourd'hui.
Et alors ?
Depuis que Guerra
a pété les plombs,
Les matons ont serré la vis
et c'est difficile de faire
passer la marchandise.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Pourquoi moi ?
McManus, te fait confiance.
Ecoute-moi.
Combien de fois
je vais devoir te le dire
avant que ça te rentre
dans la tête,
je veux pas être mêlé
à tes conneries.
T'es tellement sexy.
Me touche pas.
Je préfère les hétéros.
Tu sais quoi ?
T'arriveras pas à me baiser.
Fous-moi la paix !
C'est dégueulasse.
N'oublie pas,
pour être libéré sous parole,
tu dois convaincre Ruiz
que tu es sincère.
- Tu es prêt ?
- Oui.
Bonjour, M. Ruiz.
Je n'ai pas beaucoup
de temps, Alvarez.
Qu'avez-vous à dire ?
Luis, on avait dit que vous alliez
discuter tous les deux,
que vous alliez
passer quelques minutes
- à faire connaissance.
- Seuls.
Ouais.
OK, je serai dehors.
M. Ruiz...
Je suis désolé de vous avoir
frappé à ma dernière audience.
Pourquoi êtes-vous désolé ?
J'étais un vrai con...
Je vous ai provoqué
pour voir si vous pouviez
vous maîtriser.
Vous avez échoué.
Je sais.
- Mais...
- Mais quoi, Alvarez ?
Etre désolé ne suffit pas.
"J'ai changé, j'ai dit trois
Je vous salue Marie"...
C'est des conneries !
C'est pas des conneries.
Je m'améliore.
Je vous connais, Alvarez.
On a grandi
dans le même quartier.
J'ai vu des enfoirés comme toi
donner une sale
réputation aux Latinos.
Mais voilà ce qui
va se passer :
Tu ne sortiras pas de Oz,
ni dans trois ans,
ni dans trente ans...
Jamais.
On continuera
à suivre la procédure,
et chaque fois
que ce sera ton tour,
je verrais
à quel point tu as mûri.
Je vais te regarder mûrir
jusqu'à ce que tu pourrisses.
C'est ça...
Frappe-moi à nouveau.
Vas-y.
Miguel ?
Miguel ?
Devine qui est ton nouveau
compagnon de chambre ?
Je savais
que tu serais content.
Tu m'aides à faire
mon lit, chérie ?
Ecoute.
Je vais te dire quelque chose.
Tu as peut-être bien bu
et bien mangé,
t'as engagé et viré des mecs,
t'as fait des affaires,
alors que moi
je n'ai rien fait de ma vie,
mais il n'y a aucune chance...
Tu m'entends ?
Aucune chance pour
que je devienne ta chienne.
Miguel...
Mon canard en sucre...
Je veux pas
que tu sois ma chienne.
J'ai un aveu à te faire.
Je suis vierge.
C'est vrai.
Je n'ai jamais couché
avec un homme, une femme,
un poisson ou un piaf.
Tu dois te dire :
"J'ai entendu parler des partouzes".
Dans mes boîtes, oui...
Chez moi, c'était incroyable...
Mais je n'ai jamais participé.
Je fournis
un environnement agréable,
I'ambroisie nécessaire,
et après, je laisse
la nature suivre son cours...
Et je regarde.
Extinction des feux !
Je ne veux pas te baiser.
Ce serait bien trop commun.
Non, Miguel Alvarez...
Je veux être toi.
Tu veux être moi, hein ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Ne te gêne pas.
J'en ai assez.
J'en ai marre d'essayer.
J'en ai marre de ces murs.
Des mensonges.
De la peur.
De la mort.
J'en ai tellement marre.
Tu peux me passer un "D" ?
Alors...
Tu veux faire la fête, bébé ?
Passe-moi encore
des cachets.
Ceci est une histoire vraie.
L'Oregon a autorisé
l'administration pénitentiaire de l'Etat
à faire payer le montant de leur
emprisonnement aux détenus.
Je parle de produits de luxe
comme les soins médicaux,
Les dépenses administratives,
le lit et le couvert,
dont le coût est estimé
à 65 $ la journée.
Soit 25 000 $
par an et par détenu.
Comme l'Oregon
paye ses prisonniers
10,80 $ par semaine
pour leur travail,
vos pouvez sortir de prison
endetté jusqu'au cou,
et donc vous trouver forcé
de commettre un crime
pour rembourser votre dette,
ce qui risque de vous faire retourner
en prison où vous devrez payer.
Hein ?
J'imagine que c'est
ce qu'on appelle un cercle vicieux.
Faites briller, les gars.
Sœur Pete,
voici Noel Behn,
de l'Association pour
les Droits des Détenus.
- Oh, bonjour.
- Ravi de vous connaître, ma Sœur.
Entrez.
J'ai fait venir Noel pour discuter
de l'affaire Lemuel Idzik.
Qu'y a-t-il à dire ?
Il a confessé le meurtre d'Omar White
et a été condamné à mort.
L'affaire devrait être examinée
par la Cour d'appel.
Pourquoi ?
Son avocat a dormi
pendant le procès
et le juge n'a rien dit.
De la justice à la chaîne.
Et Idzik n'a pas protesté ?
L'indifférence dont
il fait preuve suggère
une certaine
instabilité mentale.
Nous aimerions que vous
en déterminiez l'étendue.
Vous me connaissez,
s'il y a un moyen d'éviter
une exécution, je le trouverai.
Je voulais être exterminé
par Omar White.
Quand il a refusé,
je l'ai tué,
sachant qu'on m'enverrait ici
et que l'Etat ferait
ce qu'Omar avait refusé de faire.
Tout ceci n'est qu'un moyen
élaboré de vous suicider.
On peut le dire.
C'est pour ça que vous
avez tué Kareem Said ?
Non.
C'était par vengeance.
Par vengeance ?
Que vous avait fait Kareem ?
Lemuel, vous avez à l'évidence
choisi de mourir.
N'emportez pas votre secret
dans votre tombe.
Que vous a fait Kareem
de si terrible ?
Il m'a payé un café,
dans un café à lstanbul.
C'était avant
qu'il se convertisse à l'lslam.
Il était jeune,
arrogant et brillant.
Nous avons eu
une conversion anodine
durant laquelle il m'a parlé
du "Destin funeste des Etoiles",
de...
"La Tombée de la Nuit",
vous savez,
de la fin de l'univers.
Il en riait.
Mais ses mots
m'ont déchiré le cœur.
Ses mots
ont ravagé mon âme !
Ses mots
m'on tué !
Et vous l'avez tué.
C'est un peu bizarre, non ?
Comment
une conversation désinvolte,
comment le rire d'un homme
peut anéantir quelqu'un d'autre.
Quand je me suis levé
de cette table,
il a probablement oublié
de quoi nous avions parlé.
Il a certainement
oublié qui j'étais.
C'était un moment comme
beaucoup d'autres pour lui.
Mais pour moi, c'était le moment
le plus important de ma vie.
Et je ne peux éviter
de penser que tuer Kareem Said
m'a empêché de faire
quelque chose de bien pire.
La condamnation
à mort de Lemuel Idzik,
reconnu coupable
du meurtre d'un co-détenu
au pénitencier de Oswald
a été annulée aujourd'hui.
Quoi ?
Quel enculé !
Entrez.
Entrez.
Ecoutez...
Je sais que
vous voulez mourir.
L'ironie est que vous mourrez
certainement à Em City...
Poignardé, étranglé,
ou par overdose.
Vous savez, je pensais,
aux funérailles de Leo Glynn,
à pourquoi j'avais voulu
construire cet endroit,
pourquoi je voulais offrir
une vie meilleure à ces types.
C'est certainement
parce qu'ils n'en connaîtront
jamais d'autre.
Je connais tous vos scénarios
de fin du monde.
Le soleil refroidira,
les planètes deviendront noires,
I'humanité disparaîtra.
Et je dis, OK, et alors ?
Ça n'arrivera pas avant
dix milliards d'années.
Nous sommes vivants
aujourd'hui.
Je veux dire,
nous vivons dans le présent.
Nous devons saisir
le présent à deux mains.
Nous devons marcher
dans la lumière,
nous réchauffer
aux rayons du soleil...
Tant que nous le pouvons.
Et les ténèbres, alors ?
Merde, j'en sais rien.
Je veux dire,
quelque chose ou quelqu'un
a mis tout ce bazar
en mouvement.
Je dois croire que
nous avons une raison de vivre
et une raison de mourir.
Croire c'est vivre,
M. McManus.
Vous avez de la chance.
C'est ce que je crois,
certains jours.
Yo.
Papa va venir nous voir ?
Il vient pas nous voir...
Pas exactement.
Eh Papa, vise un peu ça.
Regarde ça, hein ?
Regarde-moi
et mon meilleur pote.
Te sers pas de moi pour
provoquer ton père.
Pourquoi pas ?
Tu le hais autant que moi.
Non, je le connais pas.
J'en ai entendu parler
par ta mère.
Elle n'a connu
que la version abrégée.
J'ai eu tous les détails
pendant 35 ans.
Espèce d'enculé !
Comment on appelle un fils
qui tue son père ?
Un parricide.
Ouais, un parricide.
J'aime bien ce mot.
Le gris te va bien.
Que veux-tu, salope ?
Tu dois savoir que le dernier
recours de Cyril a été rejeté.
Ouais, ils vont
le griller dimanche.
Seamus, je veux
que tu ailles le voir.
Je veux que tu dises
à Cyril que tu l'aimes.
Tu veux que je mente ?
T'as toujours été
un bon menteur.
J'aurai quoi en échange ?
La satisfaction
de savoir que ton fils
est mort avec
un peu de réconfort.
Je te laisse
le tenir par la main.
Il n'aura pas de
réconfort de ma part.
Oublie que tu le frappais,
que tu n'arrêtais pas
de l'insulter quand il grandissait.
Concentrons-nous
sur les électrochocs, d'accord ?
Faire subir tout ça à Cyril...
C'était le meilleur traitement.
- Je suis sûre que tu t'en es inquiété.
- Va te faire foutre !
Ce qu'il y a de plus triste,
c'est que tu avais
deux fils merveilleux
et que tu les as
foutus en l'air.
Quand tu mourras et
que tu auras besoin de réconfort,
personne n'en aura
rien à foutre !
Va donc sucer la bite
de ton nègre !
- Eh, "Skillinger".
- Schillinger.
Désolé.
J'ai un boulot pour toi,
et j'ai du cash pour payer.
Ouais, quel boulot ?
Tuer Jahfree Neema.
Sans façon.
Je peux payer, j'ai dit.
Ouais. Et j'ai dit non.
T'as qu'à dire
à ton fils Ryan de le faire.
- Allez "Skillinger".
- C'est Schillinger !
Dégage !
Stud à sept cartes.
Salut, "mon frère".
O'Reily, j'ai pas
de problème avec toi.
Mais si, tu en as !
Eh ! Dégage, dégage !
Lâche-le !
Bon Dieu, merde !
On a presque fini.
Et voilà.
OK.
Je vous garde jusqu'à
ce qu'on enlève les fils.
T'es plus aussi rapide
qu'avant, hein, Papa ?
Viens pas me faire chier.
J'ai pas l'intention
de changer ton pot de chambre.
Je voulais juste te dire
qu'ils vont exécuter
Cyril demain,
et que les tribunaux
refusent d'intervenir.
T'en as vraiment rien
à foutre, pas vrai ?
Je me fous des trucs
que je ne maîtrise pas.
Tu maîtrises que dalle.
Tu vas me foutre la paix ?
- Ryan !
- Yo !
Viens me voir.
Tu veux devenir infirmier
pour aider les gens ?
Pas lui.
Cyril va être exécuté demain.
Tu peux remonter la trace
de nos emmerdes
jusqu'à notre vieil
enculé de père.
Peut-être, mais ça ne justifie pas
ce que tu veux faire.
Pas plus que ça ne justifie
le fait que Cyril a tué mon mari !
Je t'ai vu t'occuper
de ton frère...
Tu es si chaleureux,
si gentil avec lui.
Et tout à coup,
tu as ce regard...
Ce regard dangereux
et terrifiant.
Il y a des moments
où je te pardonne
ce que tu as fait,
et d'autres
où je ne peux pas.
Et je veux
te pardonner, Ryan.
Aide-moi à faire ça.
Comment ?
Promets-moi
qu'il n'arrivera rien à ton père.
Je t'en prie.
Tâchons d'oublier le passé.
Ceci est une histoire...
vraie.
L'an dernier, le juge
de la Cour Suprême Antonin Scalia
a critiqué l'opposition de l'Eglise
catholique à la peine de mort.
Il croit que les juges catholiques
qui s'opposent à la peine capitale
devraient démissionner.
Fervent catholique lui-même,
Scalia n'a pas demandé
aux juges qui soutiennent
la position de l'Eglise
sur l'avortement
de démissionner.
Lopresti m'a dit que Papa
s'était fait poignarder.
T'en fais pas pour Papa.
Il va s'en tirer ?
Le Dr Nathan s'en occupe.
J'aime bien le Dr Nathan.
Moi aussi.
Moi aussi.
Il prend des notes à nouveau.
Je te l'ai dit,
c'est parce que tu vas
avoir une séance
spéciale d'électrochocs.
C'est vrai.
Enfin.
C'est l'heure.
Des nouvelles de l'avocat ?
A bientôt, Ryan.
Ouais, à bientôt.
Si je traverse
la vallée des ténèbres
je ne crains aucun mal,
car Tu es avec moi.
Ton bâton me guide
et me rassure.
Tu prépares
la table pour moi,
devant mes ennemis.
Tu répands le parfum
sur ma tête".
"... et j'habiterai la maison
du Seigneur pour toujours".
Maman ?
Maman ?
Maman, que se passe-t-il ?
Maman, qu'est-ce...
qu'est-ce qu'ils font ?
Ryan !
Ryan ! Ryan !
Ryan.
Ryan.
Je veux voir Cyril.
C'est trop tard.
J'ai fait tout ce que
j'ai pu pour lui
et pour toi,
quand vous étiez gamins.
J'ai essayé !
Mais j'ai jamais
eu de chance.
Rien ne s'est jamais passé
comme je le voulais.
Et le jour où
ta sœur
est morte,
est le jour où j'ai appris
que Tessie avait le cancer.
J'avais peur.
Tu avais peur ?
Ouais.
Je ne veux pas mourir.
Ne me laisse pas, Ryan.
Je t'en prie, mon fils.
Je ne veux pas mourir seul.
Je t'en prie.
T'en fais pas,
Ça n'arrivera pas.
Je suis là, Papa.
Tout le monde est prêt ?
James aimerait...
Il a quelque chose
à vous dire.
Eh bien...
Je suis venu
vous dire adieu.
Je vais être transféré
dans l'Unité F.
Je suis séropositif.
D'abord, j'ai cru
que c'était Cutler...
Le type qui m'a violé.
Mais en vérité,
c'est ma faute...
A cause de toutes les fois
où je ne me suis pas protégé
pensant que ça
ne m'arriverait pas,
que je n'attraperais rien.
Et même si je sais que je vais
encore vivre longtemps,
je sais que ce n'était pas
obligé de m'arriver.
Bref...
Je suis content d'avoir
passé du temps avec vous,
d'avoir découvert d'autres
façons de voir les choses.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous là ?
Crois-moi, Verne, je serais pas venue
si je devais pas vraiment le faire.
Comment va le youpin ?
Irv va bien,
il t'embrasse.
Papa est mourant...
Cancer du poumon.
Toutes ces Chesterfield
ont finalement fait leur effet.
Il est inconscient
la moitié du temps
mais il demande
de tes nouvelles.
Mon cul.
On s'est pas retrouvés
dans la même pièce depuis 20 ans,
mais je voulais savoir
si tu avais un message pour lui.
Un message ?
Je l'ai détesté toute ma vie.
Eh bien...
C'est pas la peine
d'arrêter maintenant.
J'ai écrit aux parents de Carrie
dans le Montana,
je leur envoie
de l'argent pour le bébé.
Ils m'ont envoyé des photos
du premier anniversaire de Jewel.
Je pensais que ça te ferait plaisir.
Greta...
Ce que j'ai fait,
couper les ponts
après ton mariage,
je devais le faire.
Je t'ai détesté
pendant des années,
mais maintenant, tout ce que
je peux dire, c'est shalom.
Shalom, Vern.
Agent Taylor.
M. Beecher,
veuillez vous asseoir.
Comment allez-vous ?
Ça va.
Comment va
votre fille, Holly ?
Je vous demande ça
car un des seuls plaisirs
de ce boulot
est de rendre des enfants
kidnappés à leurs parents.
Elle s'adapte,
vu la situation.
Ça doit être dur pour elle.
Vous sortez de prison
pour y retourner le lendemain.
Ça vous dit,
une nouvelle chance d'être libéré ?
Je peux arranger ça.
Comment ça ?
Si vous coopérez avec nous,
je m'arrangerai
pour faire disparaître
les charges contre vous.
- Si c'est lié au meurtre de Tibbetts...
- Ce n'est pas ça.
Mais Keller a tué
deux autres hommes...
Byam Lewis et Mark Carocci.
Keller aime se vanter.
Je suis sûr que
quand vous étiez ensemble,
il a mentionné quelque chose.
Comme admettre sa culpabilité ?
Non, il est bien
trop fourbe pour ça.
Mais il a évoqué sa complicité.
Oui.
Vous voyez,
ça pourrait être assez...
Si on trouvait un moyen
de le formuler comme il faut.
Comme vous avez fait
pour Jerry Heeken ?
Heeken est un salopard.
Mais vous êtes
un ancien avocat père de famille.
Que Keller a enculé.
Vous êtes de retour
à Oz à cause de lui.
Vous témoignez,
vous êtes libre.
Il meurt.
Pourquoi êtes-vous
à ce point obsédé
par Keller ?
Je veux que justice soit rendue
à ceux qu'il a tué.
J'ai peut-être été radié du barreau
mais je suis encore
un juriste et je sais
qu'on ne trompera
pas la justice
en reformulant
ce que Keller a dit.
- Il est coupable !
- Je sais.
La liberté, Beecher.
Border votre petite
Holly le soir.
- Ça, c'est bien vu.
- Quoi ?
Faire en sorte
qu'il nous voit parler.
Vous allez coopérer ?
Je vais réfléchir.
Faites vite, alors.
Maintenant qu'il nous a vus,
il va gamberger,
se demander si vous allez
le balancer ou pas.
Il risque de prendre des mesures
pour s'assurer de votre silence.
Sa petite promenade était
pour me faire peur à moi, alors ?
Vous pensez à tout, pas vrai ?
J'essaye.
Ce soir,
c'est ta grande première
et le grand final de Beecher.
J'ai un petit cadeau pour toi.
Juste avant la scène
de la bagarre,
au lieu de te donner
le couteau de théâtre,
je t'en donnerai un vrai.
Tu pourras poignarder
ce bâtard
sur scène
devant tout le monde.
Et tout ce qu'on dira c'est :
"C'était un accident".
Si je dis à Taylor
ce qu'il veut entendre,
je serai chez moi
dans quelques semaines,
et Keller retourne
dans le couloir de la mort,
à faire des croix
sur un calendrier.
Tout ce que vous devez faire,
c'est travestir la vérité.
La vrai question est...
Pouvez-vous vivre
en sachant
que vous avez menti ?
Mais ce n'est pas
vraiment un mensonge.
Keller est coupable.
Oui, mais ça
n'a pas été prouvé.
Dire qu'il a dit
quelque chose
qu'il na pas dit
ne prouve rien.
Tobias, nous vivons
dans un Etat de droit,
où certaines lois son justes
et d'autres sont mauvaises.
Mais nous ne pouvons
nous détourner de la morale
quand ça nous arrange.
Dans ce cas,
autant ouvrir les portes
de toutes les prisons.
Je veux être
avec mes enfants.
Cher Tobias...
Si j'ai appris une chose
pendant toutes les années
que j'ai passées
derrière ce bureau,
c'est que les gens qui viennent
me confier un problème
ont déjà décidé
ce qu'ils voulaient faire.
Ils espèrent juste que
je serai d'accord avec eux,
et que je les aiderai
à accepter leur choix.
Je ne peux pas vous aider.
Je dois y aller. C'est la première
de "Macbeth", ce soir.
Je dois me préparer.
- Miguel, ça va ?
- Hein ?
Juste un peux le trac.
J'ai la bouche sèche.
OK. Vous êtes prêt ?
- Ça va être historique.
- Très bien.
- Vous êtes prêts ?
- Ouais.
Je suis si excité
que mes boutons vont péter.
Faites pas ça,
c'est une location.
Ecoutez-moi tous.
On a travaillé dur,
il est temps de s'amuser.
Si vous loupez
une réplique, continuez.
Ne paniquez pas si vous
ne partez pas au bon moment.
Je suis très fière de vous.
Bonne chance.
Bonne chance, Beecher.
- Miguel, baisse les lumières.
- Hein ?
Bonsoir, bienvenue
à la première représentation
de la Troupe d'Oswald.
Avant de commencer,
il y a eu quelques changements.
La seconde "sœur bizarre"
sera jouée par Reggie Rawls
au lieu de Chico Guerra.
Banquo sera joué
par Tom Smeedin
au lieu d'Agamemnon Busmalis.
Et Norman Duttweiler
interprètera le Roi Duncan
à la place de Burr Redding.
J'aimerais aussi
ajouter que Leo Glynn
nous a beaucoup aidé
à ouvrir Oswald à l'art.
Nous dédions la représentation
de ce soir à sa mémoire,
ainsi qu'à celle
de Cyril O'Reily.
Merci.
Ils ont cassé
leur tirelire, dis donc.
Quand nous réunirons-nous
de nouveau toutes les trois ?
En coup de tonnerre,
en éclair ou en pluie ?
Quand le hourvari aura cessé,
quand la bataille
sera perdue et gagnée.
Ce sera avant
le coucher du soleil.
- En quel lieu ?
- Sur la bruyère.
Pour y rencontrer Macbeth.
...bûcher permanent.
Plus tard, plus tard !
Je t'en prie,
souviens-toi du portier.
Accours ici,
que je verse mes esprits
dans ton oreille,
et que ma langue valeureuse
chasse tout ce qui
t'écarte du cercle d'or
dont le destin
et une puissance surnaturelle...
- Miguel.
- ...semblent t'avoir couronné.
Quel est ton nom ?
Tu seras effrayé de l'entendre.
Non, quand tu t'appellerais
d'un nom plus brûlant
que tous ceux de l'enfer.
Mon nom est Macbeth.
Toby, j'ai un plan pour
te débarrasser de Schillinger
une fois pour toutes.
- Ça m'intéresse pas.
- Toby...
Passe-moi le couteau !
Tu étais né d'une femme...
Je souris aux épées,
je nargue les armes
brandies par tout homme
né d'une femme.
Tourne-toi !
Limier de l'enfer,
tourne-toi !
De tous les hommes,
je n'ai évité que toi seul.
Mais retire-toi.
Mon âme est déjà
trop chargée du sang des tiens.
Je n'ai pas de paroles !
Ma voix est dans mon épée,
scélérat ensanglanté
de forfaits sans nom !
Plante-le, plante-le !
T'es mort,
mon canard.
Le petit enculé.
- Dr Nathan !
- Il est mort !
Nous enquêtons pour savoir
ce qui s'est passé sur scène,
afin de déterminer
si la mort de Schillinger
est accidentelle
ou intentionnelle.
Chris Keller dit
qu'il vous a remis le couteau
juste avant votre entrée.
Comment un vrai couteau
est-il arrivé là ?
Je l'ignore.
Suzanne Fitzgerald dit
qu'il n'y a pas eu de problèmes
pendant les répétitions.
Schillinger et Keller
semblaient bien s'entendre.
Ils s'amusaient ensemble.
Et Beecher ?
Il avait l'air d'aller.
Il était distant,
mais absolument pas agressif.
Tout ceci correspond
à ce que vous avez dit
immédiatement après
avoir poignardé Schillinger.
Vous avez
quelque chose à ajouter ?
Non.
Très bien.
Nous en concluons que la mort
de Schillinger était un accident.
Vous pouvez
revenir à Em City.
Merci.
Merci à vous tous.
Que fais-tu ici ?
J'ai demandé à Querns
de me transférer.
Il a dû convaincre McManus.
Il nous a même mis
dans la même cellule.
- Non.
- Si.
Rien n'a changé, Chris.
Je sais, je dors au dessus,
comme avant.
Mes sentiments
n'ont pas changé.
Je vais demander à McManus
de me changer de cellule.
Même dans
une cellule bondée.
Toby, bon sang.
Tu vas te mettre
ça dans la tête...
Je ne te veux plus
dans ma vie.
Après tout ce que
j'ai fait pour toi.
Comme avoir failli m'envoyer
dans le couloir de la mort.
Sans moi, mon pote,
- c'est toi qui serais à la morgue.
- Peut-être.
Ouais.
Si tu crois
que je suis content
de l'avoir tué,
tu te trompes.
Tu ne me connais pas.
Je ne te connais pas ?
Je sais que tu es libéré
de ce sale nazi.
Non.
Pas plus que je suis libéré
de ses deux fils
ou de Metzger,
ou de Cathy Rockwell.
Chris, après six ans ici,
je ne suis plus
sûr de rien.
Le paradis, la justice,
La vérité.
La seule chose en laquelle
je crois, c'est la vie.
Toute vie est sacrée.
Pas juste la tienne
ou la mienne,
mais celle de toutes les personnes
qui respirent sur cette planète...
Leur vie est sacrée.
Et la perte de toute vie,
même à Oz,
est aussi ma perte.
C'est des conneries tout ça.
Tout ce qui compte
c'est toi et moi.
Je m'attends pas
à ce que tu comprennes.
Tuer est un sport pour toi.
Moi, je ne comprends pas ?
C'est pas moi
qui ai atterri ici par accident.
Je tue par nécessité.
Je tue ce qui me menace...
Comme les Aryens.
Quoi ?
Comment ça, les Aryens ?
Ils ne nous embêteront plus.
Je m'en suis occupé.
Comment ça,
tu t'en es occupé ?
- Peu importe, embrasse-moi.
- Attends.
Réponds-moi d'abord.
Je veux que
tu sois honnête, OK ?
T'as fait exprès de foutre
en l'air ma conditionnelle ?
Toby, je ne supportais pas l'idée
de passer ma vie ici
sans toi.
Tu vois pas ?
J'ai fait ça par amour.
Si tu m'aimes vraiment,
alors fous-moi la paix.
Je ne peux pas.
Ecoute-moi.
Ecoute-moi.
J'aimais l'alcool.
J'aimais l'héroïne.
Je les ai laissé tomber
parce que c'est des poisons.
La mort.
Tu es la mort.
Laisse-moi vivre.
Je ne peux pas.
Fils de pute !
Toby, je t'aime.
Beecher, non !
Non ! Non !
Non !
Dieu est un type marrant,
ma Sœur.
J'avais décidé ce matin
d'aider le F.B.I.
- à condamner Keller.
- Ah bon ?
Et maintenant
que Keller est mort,
L'occasion est passée.
Et avec ça, ma chance
de retrouver la liberté.
En fait, je risque d'être
condamné à mort
pour le meurtre de Keller.
Vous ne l'avez pas poussé ?
Non.
Espérons que cette fois-ci,
la vérité sera de votre côté.
Vous savez, il a dit qu'il avait fait
ce qu'il a fait par amour.
On se sert de l'amour
comme excuse
pour plein de choses.
Non.
Il m'aimait vraiment,
ma Sœur.
Oui.
Et je l'aimais vraiment.
Quand Dieu
a conçu l'univers,
pourquoi a-t-il créé
quelque chose d'aussi merveilleux
et d'aussi douloureux ?
Il devait penser
qu'on pourrait le supporter.
Beecher !
Je vous transfère
dans l'Unité J.
J'ai peur que les Aryens
veuillent venger
la mort de Schillinger.
J'ai dit ça à Keller
et il m'a dit :
"T'inquiète pas,
je me suis occupé des Aryens".
Que voulait-il dire ?
Eh, Andenaur.
Regarde ça,
un paquet pour toi.
Pas de nom...
Pas d'adresse de l'expéditeur.
C'est quoi ce truc ?
Je sais pas.
- lls sont tous morts ?
- Oui, ainsi que deux gardiens.
- De quoi ?
- Je ne suis pas sûre.
Ça peut être une toxine
ou un produit chimique.
J'ai isolé le secteur.
Mais je vous préviens,
- ça dépasse mes compétences.
- Que faut-il faire ?
Appeler l'unité
de bioterrorisme de l'Etat
et évacuer toute la prison,
rapidement.
Tout le monde
au Niveau 1.
Evacuation d'urgence.
Où on va les mettre ?
J'en sais rien.
On m'a juste dit
que c'était provisoire.
On reviendra un jour.
Evacuation d'urgence.
Tout le monde au Niveau 1.

Comptez-vous !
Beaucoup pensaient qu'on ne
rouvrirait jamais Emerald City.
Je suis sorti
comme si de rien n'était
En sifflotant un air.
- J'ai tué un homme.
- Je sais.
- Va te faire foutre.
- A l'aide !
Extinction des feux, O'Reily.
Calme-toi !
Gardien !
Vous devez suivre une routine.
On vous dit quand dormir,
quand manger,
quand pisser.
Alors, qu'avons-nous appris ?
C'est quoi la leçon du jour ?
La leçon de ces jours sans fin,
de ces nuits terribles passées à Oz ?
Que toute morale
est provisoire ?
Que la vertu ne peut
exister sans violence ?
Qu'être honnête
est une tare ?
Que donner
et recevoir de l'amour
nous rabaisse autant
que ça nous élève ?
Que Dieu,
ou Allah ou Yahvé
ont les réponses à des questions
qu'on ose même pas poser ?
L'histoire est simple.
Un homme
vit en prison et meurt.
Comment meurt-il ?
La réponse est facile.
C'est le qui et le pourquoi
qui sont compliqués...
Le côté humain,
la seul chose
qui vaut la peine d'être connue.
Paix à vous.
